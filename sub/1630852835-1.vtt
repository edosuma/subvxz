WEBVTT

00:26.560 --> 00:28.962
[dramatic music]

01:01.895 --> 01:04.632
Listen up, people!

01:04.665 --> 01:07.968
If fingers need to be pointed,

01:08.001 --> 01:11.038
we know where to point them.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.241
They use the recovering economy

01:13.274 --> 01:18.412
and the rising stock market
as their bulletproof vest.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.214
But whose money is it?

01:20.248 --> 01:22.049
- Is it mine?
- No!

01:22.082 --> 01:24.118
- Is it yours?
- No!

01:24.152 --> 01:26.754
- I can't hear you.
- No!

01:26.787 --> 01:31.759
And despite all this wealth
they are hoarding,

01:31.792 --> 01:34.795
they have the gall
to accuse us

01:34.828 --> 01:38.766
of trying to destroy society
with our policies

01:38.799 --> 01:41.735
that promote equal pay
for women.

01:41.769 --> 01:45.806
Racial equality for all people.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.775
And health care for everyone.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.977
[cheering]

01:50.010 --> 01:52.346
- Well, what do we say?
Game over!

01:52.380 --> 01:54.782
- Say that again!
- Game over!

01:54.815 --> 01:58.286
- Say like you mean it!
- Game over!

01:58.319 --> 02:01.989
They label us
"domestic terrorists"

02:02.022 --> 02:06.760
when they're the ones
stifling our First Amendment

02:06.794 --> 02:11.098
with ruthless threats
and divisive political warfare.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.634
[crowd booing]

02:15.336 --> 02:20.073
Financial greed and unbridled
power is all they know.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.645
Well, now, we have
something to say!

02:24.678 --> 02:28.115
- Say it! Say it!
- Say it!

02:28.148 --> 02:32.353
If the leaders of
the United States Government

02:32.386 --> 02:34.988
won't respect its people...

02:37.090 --> 02:40.194
its people
will not respect them!

02:40.228 --> 02:44.232
Sofia! Sofia! Sofia!

02:48.035 --> 02:50.938
Sofia! Sofia! Sofia!

03:20.868 --> 03:22.636
[sighing]

03:25.606 --> 03:27.541
Um, could you...

03:29.243 --> 03:30.778
Never mind.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.288
Ma'am. Sorry about that.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.924
- Hope it won't hurt my rating.
- No...

03:43.957 --> 03:45.659
[crashing]

03:58.506 --> 03:59.640
[exhales]

04:03.911 --> 04:06.814
[dramatic music]

04:17.157 --> 04:19.593
[engine revving]

04:29.603 --> 04:31.939
[music continues]

04:39.279 --> 04:41.682
[engine revving]

05:19.687 --> 05:21.589
[all clamoring]

05:31.999 --> 05:33.166
Come on, you cowards!

05:33.200 --> 05:34.635
- Come on!
- Shut up!

05:34.668 --> 05:37.671
- Everybody, move back!
- Get on out of here!

05:37.705 --> 05:39.740
We want that shitbird spy!

05:39.773 --> 05:41.742
Sir, we can't do that.
Now, please, back up!

05:41.775 --> 05:43.210
[gun cocking]

05:43.243 --> 05:44.745
Hand the hussy over!

05:44.778 --> 05:46.246
Or we'll feed her and y'all
to T and Rex

05:46.279 --> 05:48.582
one piece at a time.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.552
[dramatic music]

05:59.460 --> 06:01.895
[crowd clamoring]

06:06.900 --> 06:08.802
[knocking on window]

06:12.640 --> 06:15.342
- You Robinson's special guy?
- I am.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.878
- Thank goodness you're here.
- You called the local sheriff?

06:17.911 --> 06:19.580
Of course not.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.081
Someone must have called it in

06:21.114 --> 06:24.217
when I unloaded my revolver
at the crazies.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.753
I panicked.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.558
[dramatic music]

06:33.961 --> 06:36.497
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.436
[gun cocking]

06:47.841 --> 06:50.478
Based on the fact these crazies
are about to bury you

06:50.511 --> 06:52.813
in a shallow grave,
something happened.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.050
I've been out here
almost two years

06:57.084 --> 06:59.820
playing the part
with these racist bastards,

06:59.853 --> 07:01.789
and it's getting inside my head.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.325
I got sloppy.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.894
They found a few bugs.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.929
Somehow traced it back to me.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.732
Stop it,
Special Agent Davidson.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.502
I need you to keep your
wits intact.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.403
I thought it was your job

07:16.436 --> 07:18.338
to get me out of
this kind of situation.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.642
That is correct.
And I'm about to.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.678
ManCome on, bitch!
Come on out!

07:24.712 --> 07:26.346
You ain't pretty enough
to be this stupid.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.148
You're about to eat
some buckshot.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.683
[glass shatters]

07:29.717 --> 07:32.052
Back up before someone
gets hurt!

07:35.623 --> 07:38.526
[dramatic music]

07:49.236 --> 07:51.672
[crowd clamoring in distance]

08:10.423 --> 08:12.860
[gas hissing]

08:27.007 --> 08:28.909
Which one of you wants
an extra hole in your head?

08:28.942 --> 08:32.012
Hey, let's light 'em up,
like a firework!

08:32.045 --> 08:33.947
[music continues]

08:35.415 --> 08:38.351
[gunfire]

08:51.064 --> 08:52.532
[explosion]

08:55.869 --> 08:58.371
- Bitch.
- Move!

08:58.405 --> 08:59.773
- Move!
- Let's go!

09:03.143 --> 09:06.079
[explosions]

09:09.650 --> 09:11.719
- Stay back!
- Grab the hoses!

09:16.556 --> 09:17.490
[knocking on door]

09:19.159 --> 09:20.961
Get in the car.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.462
Stay low.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.964
[clamoring]

09:23.997 --> 09:25.766
Come on! Come on!

09:31.304 --> 09:32.339
Subtle.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.009
[engine revving]

09:39.279 --> 09:41.148
Listen, can we
just cut to it?

09:41.181 --> 09:44.484
Are you officially
asking for my help?

09:44.517 --> 09:46.319
Because if you are,

09:46.353 --> 09:48.288
I think I have a few solutions.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.593
Alright then, I'll handle it.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.328
We'll talk soon.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.767
The President's Chief of Staff
isn't happy

09:59.800 --> 10:03.503
with how local PD are handling
the millennial soapbox crowd.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.939
Didn't realize
the FBI was charged

10:05.973 --> 10:08.408
with crowd control
at the White House.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.277
At least they know who to call

10:10.310 --> 10:12.780
when they want
something done right.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.983
You ask me, all these politicos
are chasing their own shadows.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.518
If they wanna last longer
than one term,

10:18.551 --> 10:20.821
they need to smarten up

10:20.854 --> 10:24.825
and understand what got them
elected in the first place.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.593
Fear.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.528
When the people are afraid
for their jobs

10:28.561 --> 10:30.463
or their wallets,
or their lives,

10:30.497 --> 10:33.133
they want Uncle Sam
to protect them.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.502
So if these
politically-correct puppets

10:35.535 --> 10:38.806
wanna straighten out
ornery protesters,

10:38.839 --> 10:40.040
give 'em fear.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.844
Good thing they have you, Gabe.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.049
If I've learned anything,
this job's all about

10:49.082 --> 10:51.852
finding creative ways
of keeping the peace.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.689
So...

10:55.723 --> 10:57.290
Davidson.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.892
She's pretty shaken up.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.560
I dropped her off at a facility.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.863
She's... being cleaned up
and debriefed.

11:02.896 --> 11:06.066
If it's not one thing,
it's another.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.135
These deep covers
are like the birds

11:08.168 --> 11:10.704
that keep flying
into these windows.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.806
They wiggle and flop around
a whole lot,

11:12.840 --> 11:15.642
but eventually they come back
to their senses.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.644
Yeah, most of the time.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.246
What a waste.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.249
Lucky we got her out at all.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.251
Oh, I wouldn't call it luck.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.888
I would call it having an ace
in the hole. You.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.256
As always...

11:29.289 --> 11:31.624
I appreciate you making it
happen, Travis.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.662
[mellow music]

11:35.695 --> 11:37.164
[keys jangling]

11:37.197 --> 11:38.698
[door opens]

12:11.298 --> 12:13.733
[music continues]

12:38.826 --> 12:40.760
[upbeat music]

12:49.169 --> 12:52.172
- Hey, princess.
- Grandpa!

12:52.205 --> 12:54.741
- Where'd you go?
- I was checking the perimeter.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.776
- All clear?
- All clear.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.345
Let's get some cake.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.585
[giggling]

13:05.618 --> 13:08.421
- Stay at your place?
- I'd like to try a normal life.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.257
Be in town more.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.092
Be more involved in her world.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.161
Retire?

13:14.194 --> 13:16.396
Is Gabe on board with this plan?

13:19.666 --> 13:21.601
Yeah, you haven't even mustered
up the courage to tell him.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.637
It's not that simple.
I'm going to. Soon.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.706
GirlOpen it. Open it!

13:26.739 --> 13:29.276
- Is that a purse?
- Wow!

13:29.309 --> 13:32.279
Maybe one or two weekends
a month.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.048
The odd weekday,
if we can make that work.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.783
You're busy enough
at the hospital.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.219
This way, I could help
take a bit of the load off.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.854
And it would be good for her.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.790
- And you know this how?
- She suggested it.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.959
She likes me.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.627
And she wants a male figure
in her life

13:47.660 --> 13:49.729
on a, you know,
consistent basis.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.565
[chuckles] Dad, is that a dig
at my love life?

13:52.599 --> 13:55.035
Not at all.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.237
Not your fault
that deadbeat ran off.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.342
Maybe she does,
but... I'm just not convinced

14:02.375 --> 14:05.112
that she needs one who's
borderline certifiable.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.548
It's not that bad.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.551
- How many exits?
- Exits?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.386
In this building.
How many exits?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.055
GirlWhat is it? What is it?

14:15.088 --> 14:16.423
[gasps]

14:16.456 --> 14:19.092
[giggling]

14:19.126 --> 14:20.293
[camera shutter clicks]

14:23.530 --> 14:25.398
She makes rounds...
checking to see

14:25.432 --> 14:26.934
that all the doors in the house
are locked.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.335
Good.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.703
Every hour, on the hour.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.339
Could be hereditary.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.441
Maybe, or she could be
learning it from you.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.243
You know,
first it's the locks.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.845
Next it will be the windows,
the gas stove, the electricity,

14:38.878 --> 14:40.613
and before you know it, she's
going to be asking for a Beretta

14:40.647 --> 14:42.349
for her tenth birthday.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.052
That's too young
by a couple of years.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.853
Look, I'm handling it.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.222
It's under control.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.059
And besides,
a little paranoia's healthy.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.761
You never know
what nutcases are out there.

14:54.794 --> 14:57.097
I'm just giving her the tools
to protect herself.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.898
That's where you're wrong.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.800
You think that it's all about
protecting her?

15:00.833 --> 15:02.302
In reality,
you might be the one

15:02.335 --> 15:04.137
who turns her
into a crazy person.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.941
Three. Or five.

15:09.776 --> 15:13.046
Front entrance.
Fire exit on the right.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.248
Loading dock in the back.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.018
Two more, if you count
the windows in the bathrooms.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.156
Look, I wasn't a
great husband or father

15:23.190 --> 15:25.258
and I can't unwind that.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.994
But if you give me the chance,

15:27.027 --> 15:29.162
I'd like to be the best
grandfather I can be.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.433
This for Natalie, or you?

15:33.466 --> 15:35.368
[indistinct chatter]

15:37.170 --> 15:40.107
Thank you, gramps. I love it!

15:40.140 --> 15:42.242
You're welcome, sweetie.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.276
[crackling]

15:43.310 --> 15:44.844
[screaming]

15:44.877 --> 15:45.845
Oh.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.187
[indistinct chatter]

15:54.221 --> 15:56.523
Washington News Cycle.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.830
[indistinct chatter]

16:12.672 --> 16:14.974
Pass.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.710
- Pass!
- Drew.

16:17.744 --> 16:21.048
Yeah, Sofia Flores' death
is a tragedy.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.715
No one's arguing that.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.851
But to call out Metro PD
as criminal

16:24.884 --> 16:26.986
for not naming a suspect
or divulging evidence,

16:27.020 --> 16:28.655
that's not news.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.290
That's them doing their job.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.059
I've been writing about her
for over a year

16:32.092 --> 16:33.860
because she was the voice
of her generation

16:33.893 --> 16:36.029
spearheading a movement
for real change,

16:36.063 --> 16:38.965
and in return, was mowed down
in a hit-and-run.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.301
There's no reason to believe
it was anything other than

16:41.334 --> 16:44.404
wrong time, wrong place,
bad luck.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.239
No. No, no, no, no, no!

16:46.273 --> 16:49.376
Oh! God.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.910
That's gonna cost me a few quid.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.412
The SUV had no plates.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.181
The rideshare driver
was using a fake name.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.882
That's sketchy.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.920
Okay, so the SUV
was probably new.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.555
And I don't know,
the rideshare guy

17:02.589 --> 17:03.590
was an illegal immigrant
who couldn't use his real name.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.225
Who's to say?

17:05.258 --> 17:06.893
If we don't post something
and make it news,

17:06.926 --> 17:09.396
it'll be like it never happened.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.231
That may be true.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.799
What you wrote isn't.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.236
Look, I appreciate your
enthusiasm for the movement,

17:16.269 --> 17:17.670
I really do.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.273
But news stories
are based on facts.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.774
Find them first

17:21.808 --> 17:23.143
then write your story.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.379
[sighs]

17:27.147 --> 17:29.549
[shuddering]

17:29.582 --> 17:31.651
[breathing heavily]

17:34.554 --> 17:36.956
[dramatic music]

18:00.079 --> 18:01.281
[knocking on window]

18:07.420 --> 18:09.989
ManHey, buddy,
you can't park here.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.758
Okay.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.793
Yeah, yeah...

18:13.826 --> 18:15.595
I-- I'll move it.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.899
Gun! Put your hands up!

18:19.932 --> 18:21.301
Look, I can explain.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.836
Show 'em!
Put your hands out the window!

18:23.870 --> 18:25.505
Step out of the vehicle.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.376
Put your hands on your head.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.713
Do not move.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.384
[dramatic music]

18:39.686 --> 18:41.188
[grunting]

18:41.221 --> 18:44.157
[intense music]

19:00.907 --> 19:02.475
[crackling]

19:07.146 --> 19:08.681
Freeze, asshole!

19:13.886 --> 19:15.855
You keep up
this routine,

19:15.888 --> 19:18.425
there's no way
you're walking out of here.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.233
I'm here to help,
but to do that properly,

19:26.266 --> 19:29.168
I need more information.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.538
What were you planning on doing?

19:37.410 --> 19:40.347
The police found booze, pills
and a handgun in your vehicle.

19:42.114 --> 19:45.385
Were you thinking of putting
a round in your brainpan?

19:45.418 --> 19:46.486
No.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.020
Maybe you had a score to settle.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.322
Were you there to kill someone?

19:49.356 --> 19:51.157
- No.
- Rob a jewelry store?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.659
Look, I wasn't gonna do anything
with the gun.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.160
I was keeping it in the car.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.428
On the passenger seat?

19:55.462 --> 19:57.330
I wasn't thinking straight,
okay?

19:57.364 --> 19:59.266
Are you now?

20:02.635 --> 20:04.871
[door buzzes]

20:04.904 --> 20:07.240
Alright, Dusty. My time's up.

20:09.276 --> 20:12.712
You're welcome to stay, or we
can stroll out of here together.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.549
But to do that,
you'll need to level with me.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.086
What were you doing?

20:25.458 --> 20:28.027
I was going to talk
to a reporter.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.963
[mellow music]

20:37.670 --> 20:39.272
Sign here for Dusty Crane.

20:39.306 --> 20:43.075
Mike, uh, let's just say
this one was never here, yeah?

20:47.814 --> 20:49.081
Thanks.

20:54.321 --> 20:57.924
- Where to, boss?
- A nice, quiet secure place.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.559
Where I get reprogrammed?

20:59.592 --> 21:03.296
Where you can screw your
priorities back on straight.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.832
And after that they'll assign me
to some small town field office

21:05.865 --> 21:07.133
where they can keep an eye on me

21:07.166 --> 21:08.768
while my soul slowly dies,
right?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.470
Or you work through this
speed bump

21:10.503 --> 21:14.140
in order to salvage what's left
of your promising career.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.808
I like you, Dusty.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.110
I like your passion. I like your
commitment to the job.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.012
But you were on the verge of
making a bad choice.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.948
No, it wasn't a bad choice,
it was the right choice.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.816
Wrong. You took an oath.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.752
You need to honor that.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.986
Listen, work with me

21:27.019 --> 21:28.154
and I'll spin it with Robinson

21:28.187 --> 21:29.622
as best I can.

21:29.656 --> 21:30.923
Get you back on track.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.325
Oh, you don't get it, Block.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.126
It's gone too far.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.828
We're crossing lines that should
never be crossed.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.864
Guys like you and me,
we don't decide

21:37.897 --> 21:39.632
where those lines are drawn.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.201
The only thing you need to know
is whose orders you follow.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.939
Your loyalties lie
on the wrong side of the future.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.342
I don't expect everyone
to cope with the mind games

21:49.376 --> 21:51.478
that come with
deep undercover work.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.346
Once you're in it,
it's hard to tell

21:53.380 --> 21:56.215
which way is up, down,
right, wrong.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.884
But you're an intelligent guy

21:57.917 --> 21:59.852
and I do expect you
to cope with it.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.056
You do whatever you gotta do
to me.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.325
I'm not playing
by the Bureau's rules anymore.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.894
We'll see about that.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.501
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

22:23.242 --> 22:25.177
This where my
re-education begins?

22:27.714 --> 22:28.915
Wrist.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.691
[sighs]

22:38.725 --> 22:41.661
- Grandpa!
- Hey, sweetie.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.330
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.932
I needed that hug.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.768
It's okay.
I know you have to work.

22:48.801 --> 22:52.605
Yeah. Um, you here
all by yourself?

22:52.639 --> 22:54.607
Well, not anymore.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.208
Ready to go?
It's our night.

22:56.242 --> 22:58.845
But when you didn't
answer your phone,

22:58.878 --> 23:02.515
Miss Lewis called mommy
at the hospital.

23:02.549 --> 23:06.118
So now I'm supposed to sit tight
and wait for her.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.421
Oh, I see.

23:08.455 --> 23:11.724
But that doesn't mean
you can't stay here with me.

23:13.059 --> 23:17.063
Uh... it certainly doesn't.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.998
[dramatic music]

23:23.069 --> 23:25.137
Hey, kid!

23:25.171 --> 23:26.606
Come here.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.476
You a criminal?

23:29.509 --> 23:31.944
If it's-- if it's a crime to
speak the truth, buddy,

23:31.978 --> 23:33.345
then, yes, I am.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.149
Uh, hey, no,
I wouldn't do that.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.222
I like those buttons, though.
Can I see one of those?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.758
Looks like a fun picnic.

23:45.792 --> 23:46.993
Who are these two?

23:47.026 --> 23:49.428
This is me, and that's mommy.

23:49.462 --> 23:52.231
Of course, which means
that must be me.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.768
No, you silly bean.
That's a stranger.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.809
What, what's a stranger doing?

24:02.842 --> 24:04.611
Watching us.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.245
Watching you? Why?

24:06.278 --> 24:07.480
Has someone been watching you?

24:07.514 --> 24:08.815
I don't know.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.617
I need you to know.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.256
I'm sorry, Natalie. It's okay.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.492
It's just very important for you
always to be aware,

24:19.526 --> 24:20.860
like I've taught you.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.294
But I am.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.330
And tell me if anyone

24:24.363 --> 24:26.766
strange comes up to you,
approaches you.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.467
Okay, I will.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.002
Good girl. Thank you.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.171
Are bad guys gonna hurt you?

24:32.204 --> 24:34.006
Hurt me? Nah.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.474
Why would you think that?

24:35.508 --> 24:38.277
Because mommy says
your job is dangerous.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.380
[scoffs] Don't worry.
She exaggerates.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.215
It's not that dangerous.

24:43.249 --> 24:47.119
Nothing's gonna happen to me,
or you.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.021
- Or mommy?
- Or mommy.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.325
Mommy!

24:53.359 --> 24:55.695
Hi, sweetie. Grandpa.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.936
[dramatic music]

25:09.208 --> 25:11.510
Dusty! Don't do this!

25:11.544 --> 25:14.446
[music continues]

25:17.049 --> 25:18.551
I think you have an admirer.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.486
Does he live in a castle
and have a heart of gold?

25:20.519 --> 25:21.888
He's on line three.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.656
Says your last few articles
on Sofia Flores

25:23.690 --> 25:25.057
were inspirational.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.425
Was Prince Charming
slurring his words?

25:26.458 --> 25:27.860
Claims he can guarantee you
a story

25:27.894 --> 25:31.163
worthy of a dozen
clickbait headlines.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.399
Just tell me what it is.
- No.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.401
No, it's too dangerous
to do over the phone.

25:35.434 --> 25:36.936
They're listening.
They're always listening.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.507
I'm gonna come to you,
we'll find some place quiet

25:41.540 --> 25:43.075
to talk about it.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.716
When?
- How about five minutes?

25:49.749 --> 25:52.251
[horns blaring]

25:52.284 --> 25:54.220
[intense music]

25:57.489 --> 25:59.592
[engine revving]

25:59.626 --> 26:01.560
[tires screeching]

26:13.172 --> 26:14.807
[woman screaming]

26:14.841 --> 26:16.575
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

26:16.609 --> 26:17.610
WomanNo!

26:21.313 --> 26:23.082
- Look out!
- Move!

26:37.830 --> 26:39.165
What the hell are you doing?

26:39.198 --> 26:41.000
I'm going to free my conscience!

26:41.033 --> 26:43.169
Watch out!

26:43.202 --> 26:44.470
[tires screeching]

26:46.673 --> 26:49.608
[music continues]

27:01.788 --> 27:03.690
[tires screeching]

27:15.467 --> 27:16.969
[crashing]

27:32.484 --> 27:34.153
- Get out of the way! Move!
- Hey!

27:34.186 --> 27:35.521
Stop!

27:38.991 --> 27:41.894
[music continues]

27:52.438 --> 27:54.373
[horn honking]

28:00.412 --> 28:02.348
No, no, no, no, no!

28:11.724 --> 28:13.625
[tires screeching]

28:19.866 --> 28:21.233
[coughs]

28:24.636 --> 28:26.572
[dramatic music]

28:41.153 --> 28:44.090
[intense music]

28:51.463 --> 28:52.598
[tires screeching]

28:55.167 --> 28:56.769
- Are you Mira?
- Yeah, you are?

28:56.803 --> 28:58.805
Being followed.
Let's go somewhere private.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.107
Wait! What exactly is this
all about?

29:01.140 --> 29:02.741
Look, this is really important.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.243
We're gonna have to do this
another time, okay?

29:04.276 --> 29:05.878
No, wait!

29:05.912 --> 29:08.815
[music continues]

29:35.674 --> 29:37.609
[dog barking in distance]

29:39.378 --> 29:40.679
The last person
on the planet

29:40.712 --> 29:43.916
I need talking to the
press is Crane.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.285
He should be
in a secure mental facility.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.789
Natalie's school?

29:50.823 --> 29:53.192
What the hell were you thinking?

29:53.225 --> 29:55.427
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.864
Bad timing. Poor judgement.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.665
He say anything to you?

29:59.698 --> 30:02.768
He was having a moral code
moment.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.603
Said we were crossing the line.

30:04.636 --> 30:08.040
Must feel nice to be that naive.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.275
Is that all?

30:09.308 --> 30:10.676
Just that he's done following

30:10.709 --> 30:12.044
the Bureau's rules,

30:12.078 --> 30:16.015
and based on his little
truck stunt...

30:16.048 --> 30:17.483
I tend to believe him.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.651
He's a live grenade.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.220
This one makes it
to the front page,

30:21.253 --> 30:23.122
I'm gonna catch heat
from every direction.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.958
Stupid thing!

30:25.992 --> 30:29.695
I haven't properly worn one of
these since Margaret passed.

30:29.728 --> 30:33.065
- Yeah, she had a gift.
- That she did.

30:33.099 --> 30:35.401
Bless her soul.

30:35.434 --> 30:39.371
Letting Crane slip through your
fingers, not like you.

30:41.707 --> 30:43.375
Are you alright?

30:43.409 --> 30:46.212
Yeah, I've just been feeling
a bit distracted.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.981
Well, no need to
hold it in with me, buddy.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.849
What's the trouble?

30:50.883 --> 30:53.886
I'm trying to spend more time
with Natalie.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.188
And?

30:56.222 --> 30:59.425
At this point, Amanda doesn't
trust me, for good reason.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.093
I need to change that.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.861
Anything I can do to help?

31:04.897 --> 31:07.166
Actually, Gabe...

31:07.199 --> 31:09.068
I've been thinking.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.237
Maybe it's time I hang it up.

31:11.270 --> 31:14.506
No. No, no, no.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.108
Not an option.

31:16.142 --> 31:18.410
The thing is,
it's been over 20 years

31:18.444 --> 31:20.112
of the unpredictable.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.780
Never knowing
when you're gonna call

31:21.813 --> 31:24.183
where you're gonna send me
and for how long.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.418
Which has made relationships
difficult.

31:26.452 --> 31:29.755
And now... Natalie needs
stability in her life,

31:29.788 --> 31:31.390
and I want to be that for her.

31:31.423 --> 31:34.193
I appreciate the importance
of family, God knows.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.761
Look at me.

31:35.794 --> 31:40.599
But what you do is crucial,
important work.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.768
Our people
go to dangerous places,

31:42.801 --> 31:44.736
physically and mentally.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.572
And when they go astray,

31:46.605 --> 31:49.942
I need you to bring them back

31:49.976 --> 31:51.910
before they grow horns.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.315
Saving good agents' souls.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.284
Whatever it takes.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.788
I'll tell you what.

32:02.821 --> 32:06.092
Once Dusty's in a cell
and I have the key,

32:06.125 --> 32:08.560
we'll work out a way
for you to spend more time

32:08.594 --> 32:11.097
with your granddaughter.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.264
Deal?

32:15.667 --> 32:18.070
Out of curiosity,
I pulled our security footage

32:18.104 --> 32:19.671
from when I met this guy.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.273
Uh, do you have a name?

32:21.307 --> 32:22.841
No, but our security guards
recognized him.

32:22.874 --> 32:24.343
It's the same guy
who was arrested

32:24.376 --> 32:26.645
for fighting the cops
across the street.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.248
Your fighter's your runner?

32:29.281 --> 32:31.483
You've looked better.
Did you sleep at all last night?

32:31.517 --> 32:33.485
[scoffs]
Define sleep.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.854
You know you can just
record your stupid games

32:35.887 --> 32:37.956
and watch them later.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.758
That's rather like
jumping to the belly ache

32:39.791 --> 32:41.160
after you've overeaten
without actually

32:41.193 --> 32:43.996
enjoying the cake first.

32:44.030 --> 32:47.333
I checked every police station
within 50 miles of here.

32:47.366 --> 32:50.769
No record of his arrest.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.704
This feels like another
Mira special.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.373
You don't find that strange?

32:54.406 --> 32:56.042
Maybe they just let him go

32:56.075 --> 32:57.809
to avoid another police
brutality charge.

32:57.843 --> 33:00.046
He beat the crap
out of four cops.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.684
Okay. Maybe you're right.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.156
So, what's the headline?

33:10.189 --> 33:14.193
I didn't say I have a draft,
or even an angle. I just...

33:14.226 --> 33:17.829
He contacted me.
He could be a legitimate source.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.598
Or a nutcase
wanting to go viral.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.936
[car engine rumbling]

33:26.572 --> 33:29.508
[mellow music]

33:55.234 --> 33:59.371
So... no bank
or credit card activity?

34:01.207 --> 34:03.342
Okay, what about
under Dusty's alias?

34:03.375 --> 34:06.112
His last known cover was...

34:06.145 --> 34:08.847
Uh-huh. I see.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.450
Well, keep an eye on it,
will ya?

34:11.483 --> 34:12.718
Thanks.

34:16.955 --> 34:19.391
[music continues]

34:29.468 --> 34:33.004
No, you silly bean,
that's a stranger...

34:38.344 --> 34:40.279
Watching us...

34:45.016 --> 34:47.786
- Got him?
- Oh, yeah.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.155
Grandpa!

34:49.188 --> 34:51.823
Hey, pumpkin.
Where have you been?

34:51.857 --> 34:53.759
At the park,
flying my kite.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.462
Oh, that sounds fun.
You get it high up in the air?

34:56.495 --> 34:59.898
Not really.
I couldn't run fast enough.

34:59.931 --> 35:03.469
- But mommy did.
Oh, good job, mommy.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.504
Go inside and wash up
for dinner, please.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.673
Can you stay and eat with us?

35:07.706 --> 35:10.075
We're having homemade pizza.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.943
Oh, I love pizza.

35:14.012 --> 35:15.547
Pizza it is.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.818
That was four times.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.087
Four? Are you sure?

35:22.120 --> 35:25.224
Oh, go again.
One, two, three.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.962
What are you doing?

35:30.996 --> 35:33.332
Ah, installing security cameras.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.000
On my house?

35:35.033 --> 35:37.102
For Natalie's safety.
And yours.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.770
I know that I should just say
thank you,

35:38.804 --> 35:41.707
and... some might consider that
very sweet of you,

35:41.740 --> 35:43.342
but you can't do
things like this

35:43.375 --> 35:45.010
without asking my permission.

35:45.043 --> 35:46.478
I was concerned
you would say no.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.113
And you'd probably be right.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.316
She's drawing pictures
of strangers, watching her.

35:50.349 --> 35:53.652
And what do you think is
feeding her growing paranoia?

35:53.685 --> 35:57.189
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

35:57.223 --> 36:01.227
And I admit it. I screwed up
on multiple occasions.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.229
But you've got to know,
I'm trying to fix things.

36:03.262 --> 36:05.864
Natalie doesn't need a fixer
like you.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.236
You sound just like your mother.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.338
Before or after she left us?

36:13.372 --> 36:16.275
[mellow music]

36:18.277 --> 36:19.678
I'm worried about you, dad.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.247
There's nothing to worry about.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.714
That's why I'm worried.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.182
Because maybe you can't see it,

36:24.216 --> 36:27.419
but you're not the same dad
that I remember.

36:27.453 --> 36:28.554
You know,
when I was Natalie's age,

36:28.587 --> 36:30.088
your quirks were cute.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.491
Getting my bicycle serviced
every few months.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.826
Waking up at- 00 and- 00 a.m.
to make sure all the doors

36:34.860 --> 36:36.495
and windows were still locked,

36:36.528 --> 36:39.431
and getting background checks
on my friends' parents.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.867
Your quirks
aren't quirks anymore.

36:41.900 --> 36:45.904
You need to accept that
and you need to deal with it.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.606
I sometimes wonder

36:47.639 --> 36:49.775
did the disorder change you

36:49.808 --> 36:51.910
or was it your dirty job?

36:55.714 --> 36:58.216
Finish with the cameras.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.786
So please don't do anything else
without asking first.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.631
[ominous music]

37:14.800 --> 37:16.602
WomanCan I get
either of you gentlemen

37:16.635 --> 37:18.103
something to drink?

37:19.605 --> 37:21.507
No thank you, ma'am.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.214
Special Agent Lockhart.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.949
Special Agent Wallace.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.484
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

37:32.518 --> 37:34.085
Come in.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.493
[indistinct chatter]

37:46.632 --> 37:47.999
[laughter]

37:57.443 --> 37:59.745
[indistinct chatter]

37:59.778 --> 38:01.480
Don't let baggy pants
get to you.

38:01.513 --> 38:04.616
I just can't believe Sarah falls
for his blatant ass-kissing.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.352
She's too smart for that.

38:06.385 --> 38:09.020
My take is, she enjoys it.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.189
Found this on the police wire.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.859
- Is that your guy?
- I think it is.

38:17.863 --> 38:21.500
Not exactly a dream date.
But he is kinda hot.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.369
Wanted by
the DC Police Department.

38:23.402 --> 38:26.204
Considered armed
and mentally unstable.

38:26.237 --> 38:28.874
Hm, I wonder if I should be
curious or scared

38:28.907 --> 38:30.175
about what he wanted to tell me.

38:30.208 --> 38:32.143
Probably both.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.314
"Possession."

38:38.517 --> 38:41.286
"Disturbing the peace.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.221
Assault with a deadly weapon."

38:45.857 --> 38:47.025
[knock on door]

38:47.058 --> 38:49.795
[dog barking]

38:49.828 --> 38:51.563
Shh! Shh! Shh!

38:57.936 --> 38:59.438
Mira Jones?

39:01.072 --> 39:02.374
Maybe.

39:02.408 --> 39:05.043
I have information
about your story.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.012
The one that ran away.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.721
- You have a name, Agent?
- I'm not an agent.

39:15.754 --> 39:18.289
This isn't an interview.
Please, turn it off.

39:20.091 --> 39:22.994
- Who is he?
- You tell me.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.398
- Why were you meeting him?
- Why did you chase him away?

39:26.432 --> 39:28.366
Has he contacted you again?

39:30.936 --> 39:32.438
Listen.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.673
He's wanted on multiple counts.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.341
If you know where he is,

39:36.374 --> 39:38.243
you're an accessory
after the fact.

39:38.276 --> 39:41.212
Oh, well, thank you for
stopping by and informing me.

39:41.246 --> 39:45.250
I think Little Man's finished,
Mr. Not-An-Agent.

39:45.283 --> 39:48.420
The man needs professional help.
He's unbalanced.

39:48.454 --> 39:51.790
Yeah, I read all about
our friend Dusty's problems.

39:53.258 --> 39:54.626
Guess you don't
have a subscription

39:54.660 --> 39:56.094
to the police wire.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.796
He's on the police wire?

39:57.829 --> 39:59.565
Are we done?

39:59.598 --> 40:01.867
I think we're done.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.069
I don't know
what his intentions were

40:04.102 --> 40:06.204
or why he made contact with you.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.273
But let me be clear.

40:08.306 --> 40:11.309
He's not a source for you to
make your fledgling career on.

40:11.342 --> 40:14.112
- Let it go.
- Okay, this is intimidation.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.483
And you know nothing about me
or my fledgling career.

40:17.516 --> 40:20.285
Name "James Van Dorn"
mean anything to you?

40:22.253 --> 40:24.923
No.

40:24.956 --> 40:28.259
Mr. Van Dorn and his wife lived
in a comfortable six-bedroom

40:28.293 --> 40:31.429
brownstone across
from Montrose Park.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.632
Plenty of room for them
and their three kids.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.467
But that wasn't enough for him.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.803
He also had a thing
for his secretary.

40:37.836 --> 40:41.406
He made a mistake, had a
daughter, whom he disowned.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.511
She's... probably about 30 now.

40:45.544 --> 40:46.812
A struggling journalist

40:46.845 --> 40:49.280
who lives in a
shoebox-sized apartment

40:49.314 --> 40:51.116
and writes under a pseudonym

40:51.149 --> 40:54.953
because her father demanded
she spare him the embarrassment.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.287
Get out of my way.

40:56.321 --> 40:59.157
Quoting a source who isn't sane

40:59.190 --> 41:03.028
could get you sued
for libel or fired.

41:03.061 --> 41:06.431
Although, in this case,
I'd say both are probable.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.766
There's no story here.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.334
- Says who?
- Says me.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.838
Okay.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.139
Thanks.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.209
For confirming that
there is a story. Goodnight.

41:20.078 --> 41:24.449
He contacts you, you contact me.
Got it?

41:24.482 --> 41:28.787
Take my word for it.
Don't play news hero.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.088
Don't.

41:33.424 --> 41:36.361
[dramatic music]

41:46.171 --> 41:47.338
[gun cocks]

41:57.716 --> 42:00.085
Dusty, we don't want trouble.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.219
Too late.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.021
Robinson just wants to talk.

42:03.054 --> 42:06.592
Let us take you to him. You two
can work out your differences.

42:06.625 --> 42:07.693
Good plan.

43:08.186 --> 43:11.156
The FBI shows up at my
door and tries to intimidate me

43:11.189 --> 43:15.226
because this mentally unstable
guy contacted me?

43:15.260 --> 43:16.962
Maybe he's not
so crazy after all.

43:16.995 --> 43:18.196
You sure he's a Fed?

43:19.998 --> 43:22.133
The whole thing smells
a tad unusual.

43:23.468 --> 43:25.436
Do you-- do you want me
to check it out?

43:25.470 --> 43:27.639
No, I got it.

43:27.673 --> 43:29.607
Okay.

43:29.641 --> 43:31.910
But you might want to start
adding some actual detail

43:31.943 --> 43:33.244
because right now,
the only story

43:33.278 --> 43:35.781
you're writing is in your head.

43:35.814 --> 43:38.149
Are you implying that
I'm the crazy one?

43:39.885 --> 43:43.288
No. You're the eager one.

43:43.321 --> 43:46.024
Listen, if there is a story
to be found here,

43:46.057 --> 43:47.693
you'll need to take note
of the obvious

43:47.726 --> 43:50.595
and then scrutinize what the
obvious obscures

43:50.628 --> 43:52.197
like an ultra-violet light

43:52.230 --> 43:55.266
illuminating what the
naked eye can't see.

43:55.300 --> 44:00.338
But if you do find something,
tread lightly.

44:00.371 --> 44:01.506
You've got a call.

44:01.539 --> 44:03.274
Just a minute.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.876
It's your secret admirer.

even in its best state,

45:09.240 --> 45:12.944
is but a necessary evil.

45:12.978 --> 45:17.282
In its worst state,
it's an intolerable evil.

45:17.315 --> 45:19.417
Now you might think
these words were said

45:19.450 --> 45:22.720
last night on a podcast
or a news program

45:22.754 --> 45:26.691
about today's state of
the world, but you'd be wrong.

45:26.724 --> 45:31.562
Those words were written by
Thomas Paine in 1776.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.575
I promise you,
this is a bad idea.

46:54.545 --> 46:55.646
Enough, Dusty!

[groans]

[grunts]

47:03.488 --> 47:06.457
[breathing heavily]

47:06.491 --> 47:09.160
- Time to come in.
- Just like that?

47:09.194 --> 47:10.828
After you sent those two
shitheads to kill me?

47:10.862 --> 47:13.531
What? I didn't send anyone
to do anything to you.

47:13.564 --> 47:16.501
[grunting]

47:18.336 --> 47:19.570
What shitheads?

47:20.838 --> 47:22.640
You can't bullshit me!

47:22.673 --> 47:25.076
[grunting]

47:36.454 --> 47:37.622
[groans]

47:44.262 --> 47:46.064
You're slipping.

47:46.097 --> 47:48.066
You're losing your edge.

47:48.099 --> 47:50.435
It's not too late.

47:50.468 --> 47:52.737
I can help you come back with
dignity. Get your life back.

47:52.770 --> 47:54.672
I'm done with that life.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.274
You can't run far enough.

47:56.307 --> 47:59.544
They'll find you,
cut you off at the knees.

47:59.577 --> 48:01.012
Whatever you're
telling this journalist,

48:01.046 --> 48:02.413
they'll call it treason.

48:02.447 --> 48:04.449
- That's 30 to life.
- I can live with that.

48:04.482 --> 48:07.685
No. You're not
thinking straight.

48:07.718 --> 48:10.521
It was all part of the job.
You just got in too deep.

48:10.555 --> 48:12.023
Well, deep enough
to see the truth.

48:12.057 --> 48:13.458
We're killing
innocent civilians.

48:13.491 --> 48:15.726
People that are
trying to make a difference!

48:15.760 --> 48:17.862
- Who's we?
- The Bureau.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.965
And you know this how?

48:19.998 --> 48:22.968
[panting]

48:23.001 --> 48:25.236
Because I was one of the agents
ordered to do the killing.

48:27.138 --> 48:29.941
Innocent civilians?
Under whose orders?

48:31.742 --> 48:33.544
Robinson's.

48:33.578 --> 48:35.480
That's a serious accusation.

48:38.283 --> 48:39.584
I'm going to prove it.

48:39.617 --> 48:41.486
Listen, I wanna hear
all about it.

48:41.519 --> 48:43.288
Dusty. Dusty!

49:25.896 --> 49:27.732
What just happened?

49:30.835 --> 49:32.003
Do you know who those men were?

49:32.037 --> 49:34.005
No, do-- do you?

49:34.039 --> 49:35.173
What did Dusty say to you?

49:35.206 --> 49:38.109
Uh, he-- he was bringing...

49:38.143 --> 49:40.411
Bringing you what?
What was he bringing you?

49:41.679 --> 49:43.848
This is all my fault.

49:43.881 --> 49:46.884
Mira, look at me.
Tell me what it was.

49:48.819 --> 49:49.954
Documents.

49:49.987 --> 49:51.156
What kind of documents?

49:51.189 --> 49:52.423
His orders.

49:54.225 --> 49:55.426
Proof.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.739
[mellow music]

50:35.466 --> 50:36.701
[knocking]

50:38.769 --> 50:40.238
Something on your mind?

50:42.273 --> 50:45.610
It's a sad day, no doubt.

50:45.643 --> 50:47.345
Well, let's be honest.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.680
The kid had a few
too many loose screws.

50:49.714 --> 50:52.217
Or he had a bright future,
until something...

50:54.319 --> 50:57.222
or someone
pushed him too far.

50:59.990 --> 51:02.059
Still don't know
who those two men were?

51:02.093 --> 51:05.163
No. At this point,
we still don't know.

51:06.897 --> 51:09.367
He was one of the good guys.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.302
He didn't deserve
to die like that.

51:11.336 --> 51:15.373
Well, unfortunately for him,
you got distracted.

51:15.406 --> 51:17.375
If you'd done your job,

51:17.408 --> 51:19.110
we wouldn't be wearing
these suits today.

51:20.611 --> 51:23.080
It's tragic,
but now it's finished.

51:23.114 --> 51:25.450
Let's point our focus back
where it needs to be.

51:26.951 --> 51:28.953
Plenty more souls to save.

51:30.821 --> 51:32.157
Yeah.

51:36.694 --> 51:38.095
[car engine cranks]

51:48.005 --> 51:50.141
What are you watching, grandpa?

51:50.175 --> 51:52.677
Oh, nothing, sweetie.

51:52.710 --> 51:55.746
Hey, you and Lambie
should be in bed.

51:55.780 --> 51:58.082
I can't sleep.

51:58.115 --> 52:00.151
Uh-huh? Come here.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.421
Attagirl.

52:03.454 --> 52:05.523
Thinking about your big play?

52:05.556 --> 52:06.957
Everything okay?

52:06.991 --> 52:09.827
I think I'm worried about you.

52:09.860 --> 52:12.930
Me? You sound like your mother.

52:12.963 --> 52:14.232
There's nothing to worry about.

52:18.035 --> 52:20.371
Well...

52:20.405 --> 52:23.841
You know...
some people live

52:23.874 --> 52:26.711
their entire lives thinking
they're doing the right thing...

52:28.413 --> 52:33.083
even if it means doing
whatever is proper...

52:34.552 --> 52:37.154
to make sure the good guys
always win.

52:37.188 --> 52:42.993
But then, one day
you wake up and realize...

52:43.027 --> 52:45.730
you're not sure who the
good guys are anymore.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.699
Which makes you wonder...

52:50.868 --> 52:52.703
have I been doing
the right thing?

52:53.838 --> 52:54.972
Am I a good guy?

52:55.005 --> 52:56.073
[mellow music]

52:56.106 --> 52:57.275
Grandpa?

52:58.409 --> 53:00.278
Are you a good guy?

53:04.915 --> 53:06.517
I wanna be.

53:11.188 --> 53:14.091
[mellow music]

53:28.239 --> 53:30.441
You're not doing anywhere
worthwhile here.

53:31.742 --> 53:33.444
Go home.

53:33.478 --> 53:35.079
Take a couple of days.

53:36.281 --> 53:37.382
Mira.

53:39.917 --> 53:41.586
Home. Go.

53:47.825 --> 53:49.794
- Mira.
- Oh, hey.

53:51.562 --> 53:53.030
Are-- are you following me?

53:53.063 --> 53:54.265
No.

53:54.299 --> 53:56.634
But I did wanna come see you.

53:56.667 --> 53:58.235
How're you holding up?

53:59.837 --> 54:01.772
- Not so good.
- Yeah.

54:03.641 --> 54:05.843
You, uh, you like whiskey?

54:08.346 --> 54:10.648
This everything Dusty told you?

54:10.681 --> 54:11.916
That's it.

54:13.083 --> 54:15.920
What's this "Operation U?"

54:15.953 --> 54:17.722
Unity. Operation Unity.

54:17.755 --> 54:19.990
Did he say what its mission is?

54:28.265 --> 54:29.834
These are picked up.

54:32.770 --> 54:34.271
Are you being followed?

54:34.305 --> 54:35.606
Maybe.

54:38.943 --> 54:42.680
Long story short, he was a
deep cover agent in Miami.

54:42.713 --> 54:46.083
Got sniffy with the cocaine
he was tracking.

54:46.116 --> 54:48.453
When I found him, he was
in the Everglades,

54:48.486 --> 54:50.955
wrestling an alligator
for sport.

54:52.490 --> 54:53.691
Interesting friend.

54:53.724 --> 54:55.760
Not a friend. Debtor.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.862
- For?
- Saving his life.

54:59.797 --> 55:01.499
How long you been doing that?

55:03.033 --> 55:05.370
Oh, probably too long.

55:12.410 --> 55:14.211
[mellow music]

55:16.046 --> 55:17.882
What's with the three thing?

55:17.915 --> 55:22.987
I have thoughts looping inside
my head, repeating themselves.

55:23.020 --> 55:24.889
If I do something three times,

55:24.922 --> 55:27.291
I can usually
suppress the thought.

55:27.324 --> 55:28.859
Obsessive compulsive.

55:28.893 --> 55:33.698
Sometimes the obsessing makes me
better at what I do.

55:33.731 --> 55:36.401
[chuckling]
Other times...

55:36.434 --> 55:39.169
Other times, I feel like I
should be locked away.

55:42.373 --> 55:43.774
What happened to you?

55:47.578 --> 55:50.515
I... screwed up.

55:52.182 --> 55:55.352
I served one tour in Vietnam.
I wasn't even 20.

55:56.421 --> 55:59.724
April 1975.

55:59.757 --> 56:01.058
It was the night before
we pulled out

56:01.091 --> 56:02.560
all our troops and went home.

56:04.529 --> 56:06.697
I was on patrol duty
with Robinson--

56:06.731 --> 56:08.165
Director of the FBI?

56:08.198 --> 56:11.201
The younger version, yes.

56:11.235 --> 56:14.839
We were talking about everything
we would do when we got home.

56:14.872 --> 56:16.841
Then we turned a corner
into a dark alley,

56:16.874 --> 56:20.611
and there was this man
about to...

56:20.645 --> 56:23.180
rape a local woman.

56:23.213 --> 56:25.182
It was hard to see,
but it was obvious

56:25.215 --> 56:27.151
he was roughing her up
pretty bad.

56:28.786 --> 56:31.055
I called out,
and he turned towards us

56:31.088 --> 56:32.823
with what I thought was a gun.

56:33.991 --> 56:36.827
So... I shot him.

56:37.995 --> 56:39.229
Kill him?

56:40.431 --> 56:42.032
Yeah.

56:42.066 --> 56:43.968
Then what happened?

56:44.001 --> 56:45.570
The woman ran off.

56:45.603 --> 56:47.371
Robinson and I
went up to the guy.

56:47.404 --> 56:50.274
He was face down in a
puddle of his own blood.

56:51.642 --> 56:54.278
The gun was a bottle of whiskey.

56:54.311 --> 56:56.280
Robinson flipped him over.

56:59.316 --> 57:02.119
He was our Commanding Officer.

57:02.152 --> 57:04.622
I panicked.
Robinson didn't.

57:04.655 --> 57:06.791
I can still hear his voice
like it was that night.

57:06.824 --> 57:08.425
"Walk away. Walk away."

57:10.094 --> 57:11.796
So I did.

57:11.829 --> 57:14.999
Robinson joined the FBI,
we lost touch.

57:15.032 --> 57:18.936
Then about 15 years went by,
and the phone rang.

57:18.969 --> 57:20.805
He'd just been promoted.

57:20.838 --> 57:25.476
Asked if I would work directly
for him, off the books.

57:25.510 --> 57:28.078
Said it was his job
to protect the Bureau

57:28.112 --> 57:30.114
and mine to protect its agents.

57:30.147 --> 57:31.649
Off the books,
that gives him

57:31.682 --> 57:33.684
plausible deniability for
anything you did.

57:33.718 --> 57:39.256
In hindsight, I suspect
I made a poor career choice.

57:39.289 --> 57:41.626
When you take orders for a
living, trying to support

57:41.659 --> 57:46.030
a family, you learn not to
question those orders...

57:46.063 --> 57:48.032
regardless of the
moral implications

57:48.065 --> 57:51.669
or how they may affect
other people's lives.

57:54.338 --> 57:56.674
So, other than
intimidating journalists,

57:56.707 --> 57:58.543
what other kind of
bad stuff do you do?

57:58.576 --> 58:01.278
You name it,
I've probably done it.

58:01.311 --> 58:03.180
Like?

58:03.213 --> 58:05.182
Breaking and entering,
extortion.

58:05.215 --> 58:07.852
Occasional physical coercion.

58:07.885 --> 58:09.954
Murder?

58:09.987 --> 58:13.057
That's not on my menu.

58:16.761 --> 58:20.731
And for the record, I changed
my name not for my father

58:20.765 --> 58:23.868
and his family, but out
of respect for my mother.

58:23.901 --> 58:25.803
He fired her three months
after I was born.

58:25.836 --> 58:27.304
She raised me all on her own

58:27.337 --> 58:30.541
and never once asked him
for anything.

58:30.575 --> 58:33.210
When I was old enough,
I changed my name to hers.

58:33.243 --> 58:35.279
I stand corrected.

58:36.947 --> 58:40.751
So, Mr. Block... what now?

58:40.785 --> 58:43.721
[music continues]

58:49.927 --> 58:51.528
[footsteps]

58:53.263 --> 58:54.431
Where did you come from?

58:54.464 --> 58:56.567
What's Operation Unity?

58:56.601 --> 58:59.403
It's nothing that concerns you.

58:59.436 --> 59:01.906
You know, I've always
respected my position

59:01.939 --> 59:06.343
in our arrangement...
but in this case,

59:06.376 --> 59:09.079
I prefer to be the one
who decides what concerns me.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.917
Unity. The truth, Gabe.

59:12.950 --> 59:14.885
It's not your place to know.

59:15.953 --> 59:18.388
Or even ask.

59:18.422 --> 59:21.558
So Dusty was right. You are
killing innocent people.

59:21.592 --> 59:25.029
You're running your own
secret program, Operation Unity.

59:25.062 --> 59:27.598
And when Dusty tried to go
public with it...

59:29.299 --> 59:30.567
you had him killed.

59:35.640 --> 59:36.974
Oh, please.

59:38.776 --> 59:41.278
We are not having this
conversation.

59:41.311 --> 59:43.080
Oh, yes, we are.

59:43.113 --> 59:44.548
You need to come clean, Gabe.

59:44.581 --> 59:47.417
You're confused about
our relationship.

59:47.451 --> 59:50.988
You work for me.
You are my weapon.

59:51.021 --> 59:53.791
After all these years,
that's all I am to you?

59:54.759 --> 59:56.060
Jesus.

59:56.093 --> 59:58.996
Oh, you have a
short memory, Travis.

59:59.029 --> 1:00:03.067
It was me who plucked you
from your aimless life

1:00:03.100 --> 1:00:05.636
and turned you
into something special.

1:00:05.670 --> 1:00:08.272
But don't forget, I also have a
detailed record

1:00:08.305 --> 1:00:10.574
of every law you've ever broken.

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:13.310
Everything I did was for you!

1:00:13.343 --> 1:00:16.814
I would suggest you show me
a little gratitude

1:00:16.847 --> 1:00:19.650
if you and your granddaughter
want anything

1:00:19.684 --> 1:00:21.986
that resembles a normal life.

1:00:22.019 --> 1:00:23.253
Count me out, Gabriel.

1:00:23.287 --> 1:00:25.589
Oh, no, no, Travis.

1:00:25.622 --> 1:00:26.924
There is no out for you.

1:00:31.561 --> 1:00:32.930
When does it end?

1:00:32.963 --> 1:00:34.965
When I say it does.

1:00:34.999 --> 1:00:39.136
No. My end is now. Right now.

1:00:45.175 --> 1:00:49.013
Good boy, Little Man. Stay.

1:00:49.046 --> 1:00:50.280
[cellphone vibrating]

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:51.515
Stay.

1:00:53.851 --> 1:00:55.419
Stay... Uh-uh! Stay.

1:00:57.054 --> 1:00:58.388
Okay, get it.

1:01:00.758 --> 1:01:02.292
Hey, Pearl, what's news?

1:01:02.326 --> 1:01:03.861
Pearl on phone: Your story's
getting some play.

1:01:05.696 --> 1:01:07.464
What do you mean?
I didn't write it.

1:01:07.497 --> 1:01:09.466
Ah, check the site.

1:01:09.499 --> 1:01:12.102
[dramatic music]

1:01:19.777 --> 1:01:23.247
Needs a bit of polish, but your
word choices are delightful.

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:24.982
Who knew that "dollop"
could be a verb?

1:01:25.015 --> 1:01:26.650
- I know. I was just--
- Go!

1:01:26.683 --> 1:01:27.918
- I was just in the middle of--
- Go!

1:01:27.952 --> 1:01:30.387
- Mira.
- That was my lead.

1:01:30.420 --> 1:01:31.989
You've been comatose
and I didn't want

1:01:32.022 --> 1:01:33.657
the story to get
scooped up by another outlet.

1:01:33.690 --> 1:01:35.092
That's horseshit.

1:01:35.125 --> 1:01:36.927
You sent me home
so you could steal my story.

1:01:36.961 --> 1:01:39.263
I did not.

1:01:39.296 --> 1:01:41.165
And besides,
you're too close to it.

1:01:41.198 --> 1:01:42.332
Too close?

1:01:42.366 --> 1:01:43.367
The only thing I'm too close to

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:45.102
is punching you in the face.

1:01:45.135 --> 1:01:46.170
Please don't.

1:01:46.203 --> 1:01:47.805
Stay away from my story.

1:01:49.139 --> 1:01:50.707
Whatever.

1:01:50.741 --> 1:01:52.910
There's no real facts.

1:01:52.943 --> 1:01:54.611
It's hardly even a story.

1:01:57.114 --> 1:01:59.149
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1:02:06.390 --> 1:02:08.725
What do you mean,
she's not coming over?

1:02:08.759 --> 1:02:10.560
I'm making dinner
for her right now.

1:02:10.594 --> 1:02:12.229
Amanda on phone: Do you even
know what today was?

1:02:13.964 --> 1:02:15.900
What was today?

1:02:15.933 --> 1:02:18.302
Her school play
that you promised you'd come to.

1:02:18.335 --> 1:02:20.204
Shit.

1:02:20.237 --> 1:02:21.705
I'm not so sure that I
should let her stay with you

1:02:21.738 --> 1:02:23.140
when you're not even
responsible enough

1:02:23.173 --> 1:02:25.142
to show up for the easy stuff.

1:02:25.175 --> 1:02:27.912
I've-- I've had a lot of things
on my mind.

1:02:27.945 --> 1:02:29.413
But apparently, Natalie
wasn't one of them.

1:02:34.584 --> 1:02:36.086
Yeah. You do.

1:02:37.454 --> 1:02:39.056
I'm-- I'm coming over.

1:02:39.089 --> 1:02:40.991
No.

1:02:41.025 --> 1:02:42.827
I want to apologize to her
personally.

1:02:42.860 --> 1:02:44.394
No, you and
your paranoia

1:02:44.428 --> 1:02:46.130
can't get
out of your own way.

1:02:46.163 --> 1:02:47.397
I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an

1:02:47.431 --> 1:02:48.833
insecure, screwed up kid.

1:02:48.866 --> 1:02:50.835

of yourself, dad.

for jumping your story.

Hope you're feeling better.

1:06:41.731 --> 1:06:43.367
Ah, I've got to go.

1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:45.802
See what I mean?
You can hear it in his voice.

1:06:45.835 --> 1:06:48.872
- Something happened.
- Yeah.

1:06:48.905 --> 1:06:53.643
No, I hear you and see the dots
you're connecting, and, yes,

1:06:53.677 --> 1:06:57.714
that conclusion makes a lot of
sense right now, but...

1:06:57.747 --> 1:07:00.184
suggesting that the head of the
FBI had Drew killed

1:07:00.217 --> 1:07:02.219
because he printed a story?

1:07:02.252 --> 1:07:04.654
- Sounds crazy, right?
- Right.

1:07:04.688 --> 1:07:06.223
Yeah.

1:07:06.256 --> 1:07:10.560
Listen, honey, we're all
heartbroken, okay?

1:07:10.594 --> 1:07:13.063
But the reality is, this is
probably just a bad accident,

1:07:13.097 --> 1:07:16.032
or road rage or I-- I don't know
whatever it might have been.

1:07:16.066 --> 1:07:18.868
But honestly, at this point,
sitting here playing detective,

1:07:18.902 --> 1:07:21.538
it is not going to
solve anything

1:07:21.571 --> 1:07:24.141
including a conspiracy theory.

1:07:33.083 --> 1:07:35.785
Operation Unity.
That's what Dusty called it.

1:07:35.819 --> 1:07:37.221
That could mean anything.

1:07:37.254 --> 1:07:38.888
Dusty said that the FBI was

1:07:38.922 --> 1:07:41.024
crossing the line,
killing innocent civilians.

1:07:41.057 --> 1:07:42.459
His words.

1:07:42.492 --> 1:07:44.060
And that he was coming to me
with his story

1:07:44.094 --> 1:07:47.897
because of my articles
about Sofia Flores.

1:07:47.931 --> 1:07:49.266
I'm not following.

1:07:49.299 --> 1:07:50.767
Sofia Flores was an
innocent civilian

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:53.303
killed in an accidental
hit-and-run, unless...

1:07:55.572 --> 1:07:57.274
unless it wasn't an accident.

1:07:59.008 --> 1:08:00.910
So you think she was murdered
by the FBI

1:08:00.944 --> 1:08:02.979
and that is what crossed
Dusty's line?

1:08:03.012 --> 1:08:04.948
Maybe.

1:08:04.981 --> 1:08:06.783
If what
you're saying is true,

1:08:06.816 --> 1:08:08.885
with the way the world
is right now,

1:08:08.918 --> 1:08:11.255
this could wipe out the
FBI's highest ranks.

1:08:11.288 --> 1:08:13.657
As it should.

1:08:13.690 --> 1:08:17.261
You do realize
if your dots are correct

1:08:17.294 --> 1:08:21.064
and we play this wrong,
we could both end up like Sofia.

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:23.433
And Dusty. And maybe Drew.

1:08:26.303 --> 1:08:27.704
Still wanna pursue it?

1:09:16.986 --> 1:09:19.389

where they were moving?

- No.
- But her school records...

1:09:21.191 --> 1:09:22.692
They had to be
forwarded somewhere.

1:09:22.726 --> 1:09:23.993
No, no one asked.

1:09:24.027 --> 1:09:25.729
I'm not sure what happened.

1:09:25.762 --> 1:09:28.031

1:11:02.292 --> 1:11:03.893
What am I looking at?

1:11:03.927 --> 1:11:06.430
Dusty Crane's rap sheet
I pulled off the police wire.

1:11:06.463 --> 1:11:07.997
And?

1:11:08.031 --> 1:11:10.734
Now we know he was an
undercover Federal agent,

1:11:10.767 --> 1:11:11.768
so this shouldn't
have been in the

1:11:11.801 --> 1:11:13.069
National Crime's main system.

1:11:13.102 --> 1:11:15.639
To protect his identity.

1:11:15.672 --> 1:11:17.941
- Which means it's fake.
- It's fake.

1:11:17.974 --> 1:11:20.276
The only reason to do that would
be to spread misinformation

1:11:20.310 --> 1:11:22.479
in order to discredit him
as a potential source.

1:11:24.113 --> 1:11:27.150
So someone like me
doesn't write his story.

1:11:27.183 --> 1:11:29.686
Okay, I could buy that.

1:11:29.719 --> 1:11:31.120

1:11:35.024 --> 1:11:37.361
- Travis.
- What did you do?

1:12:00.750 --> 1:12:03.286
but it doesn't have
to be this way.

1:12:03.319 --> 1:12:07.123
We always had
each other's back, remember?

1:12:07.156 --> 1:12:11.160
Now, let's go to the office
and talk about saving souls.

1:12:11.194 --> 1:12:15.899
I've told you before.
No. It's over.

1:12:15.932 --> 1:12:17.534
That's your decision.

1:12:17.567 --> 1:12:20.537
That's the wrong decision,
but yours.

1:12:22.439 --> 1:12:23.707
Excuse me.

1:12:28.845 --> 1:12:31.648
Last chance. Where are they?

1:12:31.681 --> 1:12:33.349
We're the FBI.

1:12:33.383 --> 1:12:37.186
We don't involve ourselves
in petty domestic disputes.

1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:39.689
He touches the car again,
shoot him.

1:12:44.227 --> 1:12:48.031
The great J. Edgar Hoover once
said, in a public forum no less,

1:12:48.064 --> 1:12:51.167
that the purpose of
counter-intelligence action

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:55.939
is to disrupt and it is
immaterial whether facts exist

1:12:55.972 --> 1:12:57.941
to substantiate the charge.

1:13:00.977 --> 1:13:04.080
If I were to say that in
public today, I can just imagine

1:13:04.113 --> 1:13:08.017
the media backlash that would
wash me out of this office.

1:13:08.051 --> 1:13:09.853
- It wouldn't be pretty, sir.
- No.

1:13:09.886 --> 1:13:13.923
Nowadays, this country is ruled
by gotcha moments on Twitter.

1:13:13.957 --> 1:13:16.560
But that doesn't mean
it's still not the truth.

1:13:16.593 --> 1:13:21.197
Hoover had COINTELPRO,
and I have Operation Unity.

1:13:21.230 --> 1:13:24.233
And as unpopular as
what we do may sound,

1:13:24.267 --> 1:13:27.637
History tells us that
spilling a little blood

1:13:27.671 --> 1:13:31.775
is absolutely necessary
to maintain law and order.

1:13:31.808 --> 1:13:36.212
Now, either Crane didn't
understand that, or didn't care.

1:13:36.245 --> 1:13:40.149
And now look at the mess
he's making me clean up.

1:13:40.183 --> 1:13:44.420
What's worse is, he's infected
someone... dear to me.

1:13:44.454 --> 1:13:45.622
Block.

1:13:45.655 --> 1:13:47.991
Been a good friend, family,

1:13:48.024 --> 1:13:50.259
for as long as I can remember.

1:13:50.293 --> 1:13:52.629
Sir, I may be
out of line here, but...

1:13:55.431 --> 1:13:57.133
would you like us
to have a word with him?

1:13:57.166 --> 1:13:58.935
[dramatic music]

1:13:58.968 --> 1:14:02.071
Someone in the FBI created
a false criminal record

1:14:02.105 --> 1:14:05.609
for a Federal agent involved in
a secret FBI program.

1:14:05.642 --> 1:14:08.444
That fake record was then sent
out on the police wire

1:14:08.478 --> 1:14:10.847
so that the media
would ignore him.

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:12.682
Drew obviously didn't.

1:14:12.716 --> 1:14:15.451
And now that agent
and Drew are both dead.

1:14:15.485 --> 1:14:16.720
Interesting.

1:14:18.488 --> 1:14:20.356
Almost.

1:14:20.389 --> 1:14:22.959
We run that, and tomorrow we get
a simple, logical explanation.

1:14:22.992 --> 1:14:24.528
We have no proof to refute it.

1:14:24.561 --> 1:14:26.830
Or corrupt FBI agents
following us home.

1:14:26.863 --> 1:14:28.297
- And then there's that.
- Fine.

1:14:28.331 --> 1:14:30.199
You want more proof,
I'll just call the FBI

1:14:30.233 --> 1:14:32.168
and ask for an interview with
the asshole that killed Dusty.

1:14:32.201 --> 1:14:34.137
Mira, I know this is
frustrating,

1:14:34.170 --> 1:14:36.039
but what we need is
an actual living person

1:14:36.072 --> 1:14:37.941
who can help tell the story.

1:14:37.974 --> 1:14:40.977
Someone with specifics who can
help fill in the basics.

1:14:41.010 --> 1:14:44.480
The who, the what, the when.
And if we're lucky, the why.

1:14:44.514 --> 1:14:46.049
The why is obvious.

1:14:46.082 --> 1:14:48.518
Obvious to you
isn't good enough.

1:14:48.552 --> 1:14:51.154
Listen, if we are dealing
with a corrupt head of the FBI,

1:14:51.187 --> 1:14:53.156
they will cover up the cover up
with another cover up

1:14:53.189 --> 1:14:54.724
and they'll spin it as
some top secret

1:14:54.758 --> 1:14:56.325
national security operation
that hides

1:14:56.359 --> 1:14:58.361
behind the
veil of need-to-know.

1:14:58.394 --> 1:15:01.865
The American people
need to know the truth.

1:15:01.898 --> 1:15:03.700
That's what
I used to think.

1:15:03.733 --> 1:15:05.334
And you don't anymore?

1:15:05.368 --> 1:15:08.304
Honestly, undecided.

1:15:08.337 --> 1:15:10.306
Sometimes I think
it's better to live

1:15:10.339 --> 1:15:12.075
in the happiness of the unknown.

1:15:13.710 --> 1:15:15.311
The United States government is

1:15:15.344 --> 1:15:17.380
murdering its own
innocent citizens.

1:15:17.413 --> 1:15:19.182
[dramatic music]

1:15:20.917 --> 1:15:21.885
Yeah.

1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:24.688
That is messed up.

1:15:26.222 --> 1:15:28.592
We need to nail these assholes.

1:15:28.625 --> 1:15:30.393
Nothing? Nothing?

1:15:30.426 --> 1:15:32.495
No forwarding address?
No phone records?

1:15:32.528 --> 1:15:33.997
Would you be able to pull

1:15:34.030 --> 1:15:36.199
school enrollment records
for Natalie Block?

1:15:36.232 --> 1:15:37.834
Check the entire country.

1:15:37.867 --> 1:15:39.535
Actually, Sam, one more thing.

1:15:39.569 --> 1:15:41.170
Search all informants
who recently entered

1:15:41.204 --> 1:15:42.572
Witness Protection.

1:15:42.606 --> 1:15:43.873
They may have changed
their last names,

1:15:43.907 --> 1:15:45.609
but they would have kept
their first.

1:15:45.642 --> 1:15:47.510
Amanda and Natalie.

1:15:47.543 --> 1:15:49.445
Okay. Hey-- hey, Sam.

1:15:49.478 --> 1:15:51.247
Let's keep this between us.

1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:53.717
Do this for me,
consider us even.

1:15:53.750 --> 1:15:54.751
Thanks, Sam.

1:15:54.784 --> 1:15:57.754
[music continues]

1:15:57.787 --> 1:15:59.488
[phone vibrating]

1:16:01.625 --> 1:16:03.593
Block.

1:16:03.627 --> 1:16:05.762
Oh, yeah, uh, Mira.

1:16:05.795 --> 1:16:08.564
Listen, uh, now's not
a good time.

1:16:12.235 --> 1:16:14.070
What do you have?

1:16:14.103 --> 1:16:15.805
Robinson's very capable

1:16:15.839 --> 1:16:18.407
when it comes
to cleaning up his messes.

1:16:18.441 --> 1:16:21.077
I would say this has his
fingerprints all over it.

1:16:21.110 --> 1:16:24.748
I need a quote
from a reliable source.

1:16:24.781 --> 1:16:27.150
I'm the last person
you want as a source.

1:16:27.183 --> 1:16:28.584
But you know it's wrong.

1:16:28.618 --> 1:16:31.054
I know what I know,
but my hands are dirty.

1:16:31.087 --> 1:16:33.489
You put my name out there,
my credibility,

1:16:33.522 --> 1:16:35.158
it'll come into question.

1:16:35.191 --> 1:16:36.660
Even my sanity.

1:16:36.693 --> 1:16:38.461
They'll say I made the
whole thing up,

1:16:38.494 --> 1:16:41.597
all in the name of
protecting myself.

1:16:41.631 --> 1:16:44.768
Probably wind up like Dusty.

1:16:44.801 --> 1:16:46.235
I still don't understand
why Robinson

1:16:46.269 --> 1:16:47.804
would go to all these lengths.

1:16:49.438 --> 1:16:52.976
Same reason Hoover did it
for almost 50 years.

1:16:53.009 --> 1:16:55.611
To maintain power, control,

1:16:55.645 --> 1:16:58.782
which will give him a
shelf life that'll outlast

1:16:58.815 --> 1:17:02.418
every politician on Capitol Hill
and in the White House.

1:17:02.451 --> 1:17:04.688
You can't let them
get away with this.

1:17:04.721 --> 1:17:07.657
I mean, this is your chance
to right all your wrongs.

1:17:07.691 --> 1:17:10.193
What's done is done.
There's no going backwards.

1:17:10.226 --> 1:17:12.295
Then let's go forward
and prevent Robinson

1:17:12.328 --> 1:17:14.798
from abusing his power
in the future.

1:17:14.831 --> 1:17:16.165
If we don't stand up to him,

1:17:16.199 --> 1:17:17.834
he'll just keep growing
Operation Unity.

1:17:19.135 --> 1:17:20.536
He probably will.

1:17:20.569 --> 1:17:24.107
Remember, it's your job
to protect the agents.

1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:25.675
How many more Dusty's
have to die for you

1:17:25.709 --> 1:17:26.876
to stop looking the other way?

1:17:26.910 --> 1:17:29.846
[mellow music]

1:17:32.015 --> 1:17:33.850
As long as I've worked
for Robinson,

1:17:33.883 --> 1:17:37.286
I've-- I've never heard
of Operation Unity.

1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:38.722
Somebody must know.

1:17:38.755 --> 1:17:40.857
These sort of people
don't talk out of turn.

1:17:40.890 --> 1:17:43.492
Maybe, but secrets
this big can't hide forever.

1:17:47.096 --> 1:17:49.532
Robinson has a safe in his house

1:17:49.565 --> 1:17:51.968
where he keeps a
record of everyone

1:17:52.001 --> 1:17:54.370
and everything
the Bureau touches.

1:17:54.403 --> 1:17:57.040
Everything?
- Everything.

1:17:57.073 --> 1:17:59.709
It's his security blanket,

1:17:59.743 --> 1:18:04.047
ammunition in case anyone
decides to turn against him.

1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:10.186
If there's a paper trail on
Operation Unity, it's in there.

1:18:10.219 --> 1:18:12.621

1:19:50.219 --> 1:19:52.155
[explosion]

1:20:08.504 --> 1:20:10.840
What do you mean,
he blew up your car?

1:20:10.874 --> 1:20:12.741
Lockhart on phone: Block shot it
with a grenade launcher.

1:20:15.144 --> 1:20:16.479
[laughs]

1:20:18.047 --> 1:20:19.983
I must never
underestimate that man.

1:20:20.016 --> 1:20:21.217
[doorbell rings]

1:20:22.751 --> 1:20:25.454
Where is the crazy
son-of-a-bitch now?

1:20:25.488 --> 1:20:26.755
Lockhart on phone: Don't know.

1:20:27.756 --> 1:20:29.658
Well, I do.

1:20:29.692 --> 1:20:31.327
He's here.

1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:34.463
- Here as in?
- As in, my front door.

1:20:34.497 --> 1:20:37.566
If you're not too busy,
you might wanna stop by.

1:20:40.769 --> 1:20:42.005
[exhales sharply]

1:20:43.006 --> 1:20:45.708
[dramatic music]

1:20:45.741 --> 1:20:47.076
Wasn't expecting you.

1:20:48.544 --> 1:20:50.013
Got a minute?

1:20:56.585 --> 1:20:59.222
- You sent them. Right.
- I sent who?

1:20:59.255 --> 1:21:01.524
You know, if you were
just honest with me,

1:21:01.557 --> 1:21:03.092
I'd have more respect for you.

1:21:03.126 --> 1:21:05.394
I take it this isn't
a friendly pop in.

1:21:05.428 --> 1:21:06.695
What the hell do you want?

1:21:06.729 --> 1:21:09.098
All your files
on Operation Unity.

1:21:09.132 --> 1:21:10.599
I'm afraid that's not happening.

1:21:11.867 --> 1:21:13.536
It's not a request, Gabriel.

1:21:15.271 --> 1:21:17.040
This is a huge mistake.

1:21:17.073 --> 1:21:19.108
I'll add it to my list.
Open it.

1:21:19.142 --> 1:21:20.676
Or what?

1:21:20.709 --> 1:21:22.711
Are you really gonna
shoot me, Travis?

1:21:23.712 --> 1:21:24.981
Yes, I will.

1:21:31.154 --> 1:21:32.455
The hard drive.

1:21:32.488 --> 1:21:34.290
I need to see what's on it.

1:21:34.323 --> 1:21:35.824
Load it up.

1:21:43.732 --> 1:21:45.234
Step aside.

1:21:50.739 --> 1:21:53.276
The world isn't ready
to see what's on that drive.

1:21:53.309 --> 1:21:55.611
The truth can be difficult,

1:21:55.644 --> 1:21:57.446
but it's better than
the alternative.

1:21:57.480 --> 1:21:59.815
[dramatic music]

1:22:11.594 --> 1:22:13.229

This is not your fight.

You were just taking orders.

[knocking on door]

1:27:59.007 --> 1:28:00.376
Travis.

1:28:26.535 --> 1:28:28.471
[gasps]

1:28:28.504 --> 1:28:30.773
- Who are you?
- Uh...

1:28:30.806 --> 1:28:32.475
This is Pearl.
She works with me.

1:28:32.508 --> 1:28:34.677
Please don't shoot her.

1:28:36.979 --> 1:28:38.814
Can we trust her with this?

1:28:38.847 --> 1:28:40.248
We can.

1:28:45.988 --> 1:28:48.123
Donuts? Really?

1:28:48.156 --> 1:28:50.125
It-- it was all I could
find in this dump.

1:28:50.158 --> 1:28:52.160
So, Robinson hid
Amanda and Natalie

1:28:52.194 --> 1:28:54.697
in Witness Protection?

1:28:54.730 --> 1:28:56.432
But no idea where they are?

1:28:57.533 --> 1:28:59.234
Uh-huh, okay.

1:28:59.267 --> 1:29:00.403
Thanks, Sam.

1:29:00.436 --> 1:29:02.337
Yeah. Appreciate you looking.

1:29:10.178 --> 1:29:12.648
Using your family as leverage
against you is so effing wrong.

1:29:12.681 --> 1:29:14.417
Sorry to say.

1:29:14.450 --> 1:29:17.986
Seems relatively minor compared
to everything else he's doing.

1:29:18.020 --> 1:29:21.323
Character assassinations,
political blackmail.

1:29:21.356 --> 1:29:22.991
Looks like flat out murder.

1:29:23.025 --> 1:29:26.261
All under the guise
of protecting democracy.

1:29:26.294 --> 1:29:28.397
What does it say
about Dusty Crane?

1:29:31.099 --> 1:29:32.401
Looks like you've got
everything you'd ever

1:29:32.435 --> 1:29:33.602
want to know about him.

1:29:33.636 --> 1:29:34.937
Oh, there's a video.

1:29:34.970 --> 1:29:36.204
Play it.

1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:39.374
Dustin Crane, Special Agent.

1:29:39.408 --> 1:29:41.610
ManYour mission?

1:29:41.644 --> 1:29:43.546
You know that.
It's deep infill.

1:29:43.579 --> 1:29:46.682
ManHave you maintained
contact with the target?

1:29:46.715 --> 1:29:49.618
Yes, the target's name
is Sofia Flores.

1:29:49.652 --> 1:29:51.754
ManHow often
is your exposure?

1:29:51.787 --> 1:29:53.088
Every day,
at least

1:29:53.121 --> 1:29:54.790
a few hours a day,
sometimes longer.

1:29:54.823 --> 1:29:56.291
ManHow have you
been able to maintain that

1:29:56.324 --> 1:29:59.595
level of contact with
an unsuspecting target?

1:29:59.628 --> 1:30:02.297
She, uh, she thinks
I'm her boyfriend.

1:30:03.599 --> 1:30:05.067
ManAnd?

1:30:05.100 --> 1:30:06.769
Are you her boyfriend?

1:30:08.236 --> 1:30:10.806
I'd like to think so.

1:30:10.839 --> 1:30:12.775
ManHow long has
this been going on?

1:30:15.811 --> 1:30:18.481
A little over a year now.

1:30:18.514 --> 1:30:20.849
ManAnd she has
no idea who you really are?

1:30:22.350 --> 1:30:24.753
No, no. No, she doesn't.

1:30:27.322 --> 1:30:29.625
[inhales]

1:30:29.658 --> 1:30:31.827
You can see
it in his face.

1:30:31.860 --> 1:30:33.529
They were in love.

1:30:34.830 --> 1:30:36.431
I feel sick.

1:30:39.702 --> 1:30:42.170
[dramatic music]

1:31:02.558 --> 1:31:05.360
What are you doing?
You're going the wrong way.

1:31:05.393 --> 1:31:09.197
You knew Dusty Crane was
in love with Sofia Flores.

1:31:09.231 --> 1:31:10.633
Travis!

1:31:10.666 --> 1:31:12.501
You got nervous he might
come clean to her.

1:31:12.535 --> 1:31:14.469
The thought that someone
with her influence

1:31:14.503 --> 1:31:16.705
might find out what you were
up to scared you.

1:31:16.739 --> 1:31:18.674
You slippery shit.

1:31:18.707 --> 1:31:20.175
Pull the damn car over.

1:31:20.208 --> 1:31:22.945
That's why you killed her,
and then him.

1:31:22.978 --> 1:31:24.847
To protect your
secret operation.

1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:26.982
You know nothing.

1:31:27.015 --> 1:31:28.851
[engine revving]

1:31:28.884 --> 1:31:31.153
[tires screeching]

1:31:31.186 --> 1:31:32.555
Listen carefully.

1:31:32.588 --> 1:31:35.658
Operation Unity is going public.
The whole thing.

1:31:35.691 --> 1:31:37.626
Bullshit.
- You need to listen.

1:31:37.660 --> 1:31:39.061
Not to you, I don't.

1:31:39.094 --> 1:31:40.395
[tires screech]

1:31:42.030 --> 1:31:43.599
How about now?

1:31:45.701 --> 1:31:47.703
Our arrangement never happened.

1:31:47.736 --> 1:31:49.337
You're going to destroy my file

1:31:49.371 --> 1:31:51.306
and forget everything
I've done for you.

1:31:51.339 --> 1:31:53.008
After that, you will go public

1:31:53.041 --> 1:31:54.743
with the truth
about the operation.

1:31:54.777 --> 1:31:56.679
I am the director of the most

1:31:56.712 --> 1:31:59.682
powerful organization
in the world.

1:31:59.715 --> 1:32:02.484
I will not bargain with you.

1:32:02.517 --> 1:32:04.553
Then call it coercion.

1:32:04.587 --> 1:32:07.422
If I'm not being convincing
enough, there are other ways.

1:32:08.757 --> 1:32:11.193

1:32:21.236 --> 1:32:22.938
[gunshots]

1:32:22.971 --> 1:32:24.139
Ahh!

1:32:26.474 --> 1:32:28.711
[Gabriel groaning]

1:32:33.148 --> 1:32:35.951
Fine. We'll do it your way.

1:32:35.984 --> 1:32:37.753
I'll clean your record.

1:32:37.786 --> 1:32:41.356
But there is no chance in hell
I am admitting to anything,

1:32:41.389 --> 1:32:45.728
and if I hear a whisper
of Operation Unity in the press,

1:32:45.761 --> 1:32:48.563
you'll be indicted
before the day is over.

1:32:50.966 --> 1:32:55.203
That was the last threat
you will ever make to me.

1:32:55.237 --> 1:32:57.472
You wanna put a bullet
in your old friend?

1:32:59.507 --> 1:33:01.610
Go ahead.

1:33:01.644 --> 1:33:03.779
You'd be doing me a favor.

1:33:04.980 --> 1:33:06.481
Please, do it.

1:33:08.116 --> 1:33:09.652
Do it!

1:33:09.685 --> 1:33:12.120
[mellow music]

1:33:14.156 --> 1:33:15.457
No.

1:33:15.490 --> 1:33:17.159
You're not getting
off that easy.

1:33:17.192 --> 1:33:19.094
The truth needs to be told.

1:33:19.127 --> 1:33:21.964
And you're gonna be
the one to tell it.

1:33:21.997 --> 1:33:25.600
But first, you tell me.
Where's my family?

1:33:28.270 --> 1:33:30.939
[instrumental music]

1:33:34.509 --> 1:33:36.945
[engine rumbling]

1:33:57.900 --> 1:33:59.301
There she is!

1:33:59.334 --> 1:34:00.535
Grandpa!

1:34:00.568 --> 1:34:03.505
Hey, come here to me.

1:34:03.538 --> 1:34:05.440
You don't need to worry,
nobody's out there.

1:34:05.473 --> 1:34:07.142
I've already checked.

1:34:07.175 --> 1:34:09.311
Good, and there
probably never will be.

1:34:09.344 --> 1:34:11.146
That's just how
my brain is wired.

1:34:11.179 --> 1:34:12.380
I know.

1:34:12.414 --> 1:34:13.816
I missed you.

1:34:13.849 --> 1:34:15.317
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

1:34:15.350 --> 1:34:17.019
Everything okay?

1:34:17.052 --> 1:34:18.721
Just never thought we'd
be in Witness Protection.

1:34:18.754 --> 1:34:20.989
- Sorry about all that.
- It's alright. We're fine.

1:34:21.023 --> 1:34:23.458
I'm just sorry about everything
that you've been through.

1:34:23.491 --> 1:34:25.360
- Is everything okay with you?
- Couldn't be better.

1:34:25.393 --> 1:34:26.494
[chuckles]

1:34:26.528 --> 1:34:29.064
- Anybody wanna go home?
- I do!

1:34:29.097 --> 1:34:30.766
- I do!
- Me, too.

1:34:33.068 --> 1:34:35.704
"Robinson was indicted
after admitting to the existence

1:34:35.738 --> 1:34:37.339
of the morally
reprehensible program

1:34:37.372 --> 1:34:39.708
he dubbed Operation Unity.

1:34:39.742 --> 1:34:42.210
He remains behind bars,
awaiting trial."

1:34:42.244 --> 1:34:43.746
Look at these comments.

1:34:43.779 --> 1:34:45.680
"Explosive."

1:34:45.714 --> 1:34:48.250
"The News Cycle at its finest."

1:34:48.283 --> 1:34:49.484
Don't forget this one.

1:34:49.517 --> 1:34:51.153
"Award-worthy reporting."

1:34:51.186 --> 1:34:52.254
[laughs]

1:34:52.287 --> 1:34:53.722
I'm proud of you, Mira.

1:35:00.028 --> 1:35:01.329
I saw it.

1:35:01.363 --> 1:35:03.598
Well, what do you think?

1:35:03.631 --> 1:35:07.169
Very thorough.
I, uh...

1:35:07.202 --> 1:35:11.339
I was surprised you didn't
mention my Vietnam mishap.

1:35:11.373 --> 1:35:12.941
No use for you being on trial

1:35:12.975 --> 1:35:15.043
for something you did
when you were a kid.

1:35:17.045 --> 1:35:19.447
[instrumental music]

1:35:21.549 --> 1:35:23.351
Article's good.

1:35:23.385 --> 1:35:24.586
Thank you.

1:35:24.619 --> 1:35:27.722
For... everything.

1:35:27.756 --> 1:35:30.192
I couldn't have
done it without you.

1:35:30.225 --> 1:35:34.662
And I wouldn't have done it
without you, so... thank you.

1:35:35.964 --> 1:35:37.299
You're welcome.

1:35:37.332 --> 1:35:39.301
Take care, Mira.

1:35:39.334 --> 1:35:40.635
You too.

1:35:43.939 --> 1:35:46.308
Ah, a little help, please.

1:35:47.742 --> 1:35:49.744
Run, run, run!
Keep running!

1:35:51.079 --> 1:35:52.815
Go! That's a girl.

1:35:52.848 --> 1:35:54.649
That's it, keep going.

1:35:54.682 --> 1:35:57.719
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- It's flying! It's flying!

1:35:57.752 --> 1:35:58.821
Atta girl.

1:35:58.854 --> 1:36:00.088
You're pretty good at that.

1:36:00.122 --> 1:36:03.558
A bit rusty. Go!

1:36:03.591 --> 1:36:05.961
You sure you don't wanna hang
out with us this weekend?

1:36:05.994 --> 1:36:07.295
I'm good.

1:36:08.763 --> 1:36:10.132
I have a date.

1:36:10.165 --> 1:36:12.334
- Good for you.
- Yeah, we'll see.

1:36:12.367 --> 1:36:14.269
But if you or Natalie need
anything, just let me know.

1:36:14.302 --> 1:36:15.403
Uh-huh. Will do.

1:36:15.437 --> 1:36:17.005
And don't forget to feed her.

1:36:17.039 --> 1:36:18.273
Make sure she brushes
her teeth, get her to school

1:36:18.306 --> 1:36:19.641
on time, Monday morning.

1:36:19.674 --> 1:36:21.944
Food, teeth, school.
Consider it done.

1:36:21.977 --> 1:36:23.178
Anything else?

1:36:24.312 --> 1:36:26.414
No shooting guns.

1:36:26.448 --> 1:36:27.649
Uh-huh.

1:36:28.616 --> 1:36:30.018
No guns.

1:36:32.620 --> 1:36:34.322
Where do you stand
on explosives?
