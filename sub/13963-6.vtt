00:04.588 --> 00:06.423
I mean, a 13-year-old
guitar prodigy,

00:06.423 --> 00:07.925
and she's a chick;
that's cool, man.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.218
I know. I know.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.720
She--she's a massive
Gaga fan.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.014
She saw me in that Gibson ad.
She made the connection.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.058
And it's, like,
a Make-a-Wish-type thing, right?

00:16.058 --> 00:18.143
Yeah, Dream-a-Music-Dream
Foundation.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.728
"Meet your hero."
She picked me.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.605
And does she have,
like, cancer or something?

00:21.605 --> 00:23.148
No, lupus.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.983
Oh, oh, oh, okay.
Well, that explains it.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.318
Explains what?

00:26.318 --> 00:27.819
Well, I mean,
if she was a cancer kid,

00:27.819 --> 00:29.488
she would meet actual
famous people, like--

00:29.488 --> 00:31.740
I don't know--
Jeter and, you know, Gaga.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.033
You know what I mean?
The A-list.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.535
But you're not on the A-list.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.161
You're on the lupus list,
which is fine.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.413
She can't go out in the sun,
she can't have candy

00:38.413 --> 00:41.250
or ice cream, so yeah,
she's basically a shut-in.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.085
And I--
dude, I know, that sucks,

00:43.085 --> 00:45.712
but see, if she was, like,
a cancer kid, she'd meet Adele.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.756
I bet you Adele's, like,
the number one attraction

00:47.756 --> 00:49.675
for cancer kids right now.

00:49.675 --> 00:52.928
It's amazing, because only you
could turn this into a negative.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.429
(scoffs)

00:54.429 --> 00:56.098

into a positive?

00:56.098 --> 00:57.766
-Who?
-Adele.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.309
(...) you.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.144
I'm just thinking
about Tenika, pal.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.688
No, you're just jealous.

01:02.688 --> 01:03.855
I'm jealous?

01:03.855 --> 01:06.024
-Yeah.
-What am I jealous of?

01:06.024 --> 01:08.068
Because you're not
on the goddamn lupus list...

01:08.068 --> 01:09.653
-Oh.
-'Cause I am, asshole.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.029

Yeah, yeah.

is that about?

01:13.657 --> 01:15.784
What?

01:15.784 --> 01:17.452
Ava got a rave
from "The New York Times."

01:17.452 --> 01:18.912
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.163
-Awesome.
-I know.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.081

did they mention The Heathens?

'Cause, no, I mean,
he mentioned the backup singers,

I want to do on you.

Yes!

Hey, so how do you--
how do you think

02:38.742 --> 02:39.868
we're gonna do this now?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.328
Do what?

02:41.328 --> 02:42.954
Well, I'm just thinking
about, like,

02:42.954 --> 02:44.915
you definitely want to pursue
this solo career thing.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.625
Hell yeah.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.543
Yeah, so it means
we're gonna need more songs,

02:48.543 --> 02:51.338
and I'm just wondering what the
process is gonna be, 'cause--

02:51.338 --> 02:53.715
So, yes, because it's got
kind of, like, a nice flow...

02:53.715 --> 02:55.967
You know, Flash and I are
already writing all these songs

02:55.967 --> 02:58.762
for Gigi, and now we're gonna
have to write more Ava X songs,

02:58.762 --> 03:00.972
and so maybe I'm just thinking,
you know, maybe

03:00.972 --> 03:03.642
we just slow the process down
a little bit, you know?

03:03.642 --> 03:05.435
-Johnny? Johnny.
-What?

03:05.435 --> 03:06.812

at my place later, so...

03:16.238 --> 03:17.989
-Oh.
-We got it covered.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.491
Look at this.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.076
I love that you've thought
about this.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.369
Good.
Well, that's, you know--

03:22.369 --> 03:23.745
-That's good.
-Makes it easier.

it reduces me.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.090
All right, you know what,
dude?

04:59.090 --> 05:00.926
He's not De Niro

05:00.926 --> 05:02.636
in his "Raging Bull" days, okay?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.262
And he is nowhere near
Daniel Day-Lewis.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.722

05:05.722 --> 05:07.891
the entire time
he's shooting a picture.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.977
Campbell is gonna have
the whole cast and crew fast

05:10.977 --> 05:13.939
for three weeks
before opening night

05:13.939 --> 05:16.024
so we can feel the famine

05:16.024 --> 05:17.526

05:17.526 --> 05:19.194

a highly acclaimed movie
of "Hamlet" a few years back.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.921

he wants to do the same thing

05:37.921 --> 05:39.297

08:11.241 --> 08:14.661
That's nothing.
That's, like, 5%.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.997
That's more than 100.
That's 105.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.667
And that's what I'm--
I'm 105% in on this whole--

08:20.667 --> 08:21.960
Okay, listen.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.002
That's how much
I'm supporting it.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.212
I...
(sighs)

08:24.212 --> 08:25.463
I am so plugged in
to my own thing,

08:25.463 --> 08:26.631
I can't even begin
to process

08:26.631 --> 08:28.633
how I feel about
anything else, okay?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.468
All I know
is that this

08:30.468 --> 08:33.430
is the best I have
ever felt about me.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.682
The way those audiences
reacted to me and the--

08:35.682 --> 08:37.559
the groove I got into
with the band,

08:37.559 --> 08:40.562
it's like--
ugh, it's exhilarating

08:40.562 --> 08:45.650
and scary and mind-blowing
and totally freakin' electric.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.194
And it's disappointing to know

08:48.194 --> 08:51.781
that my boyfriend doesn't...

08:51.781 --> 08:54.200
feel the same way.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.662
I wanted to share this with you,
not feel guilty about it.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.374
Let me do your hair.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.542
-What?
-Look.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.877
I've been watching
YouTube videos

09:03.877 --> 09:05.628
about how to blow-dry hair
and style hair.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.714
No, no, no, I think I can do
a better job than Flash, honey.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.299
-Seriously.
-No, Johnny, no!

09:09.299 --> 09:10.633
(sighs)

09:10.633 --> 09:12.677
You need to hang tight
right now,

09:12.677 --> 09:14.429
and I need to focus on me.

09:14.429 --> 09:17.640
You need to focus on me.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.933
Stop staring at my hair.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.185
Honey, it's part of my focus.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.436
I'm focused in on your hair.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.396
Your hair is part of you,
you know?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.023
Big part of you!

09:27.233 --> 09:28.693
Know what we should do,
Johnny Rock?

09:28.693 --> 09:29.903
What?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.446
We should write
a song about lupus.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.739
Tenika.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.115
What do you mean,
like a ballad?

09:34.115 --> 09:36.284
Like a charity anthem.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.744
Like "We Are the World"

09:37.744 --> 09:39.913
or that song "Ronan"
that Taylor Swift did

09:39.913 --> 09:41.331
or the Christmas one.

09:41.331 --> 09:44.167
But no one ever wrote
one of those about lupus.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.252
"Ronan" was good, but a lot
of those charity anthems

09:46.252 --> 09:47.879
are just kind of, like--
I don't know.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.464
They all have
that same kind of

09:49.464 --> 09:51.007
chord change setup too,
you know?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.008
That same vibe.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.195
I just--
I don't know.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.989
I never wrote a song
with anyone before.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.490
This was so awesome,

11:39.490 --> 11:42.869
and it was funny and sucky
in the beginning,

11:42.869 --> 11:45.955
but it was also kind of true,

11:45.955 --> 11:48.583
but it was so cool.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.253
It's okay.
Come here.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.006
You know what?
Tell you what.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.633
Any time you want
to write a song,

11:56.633 --> 11:59.510
you can come back here and--
and jam with me.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.637
-Okay?
-Yeah.

12:00.637 --> 12:01.554

12:03.223 --> 12:05.016
-You all right?
-Mm-hmm.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.810
I'm good.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.438
All right.
Let's do something else.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.273
-Let's do a cover.
-(laughs)

12:12.273 --> 12:13.775
You want to do a cover?
What do you want to sing?

12:13.775 --> 12:15.193
-Sure.
-Joni Mitchell.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.694
No, we're not doing
Joni Mitchell.

12:16.694 --> 12:17.737
Oh, my God.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.086
(both moaning)

12:43.680 --> 12:45.431
That's definitely
the last time.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.975
Definitely.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.726
I just--I needed
to get it out of my system.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.019
Me too. Closure.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.354
Closure.

12:51.354 --> 12:54.732
That's a good word.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.610
We should, um...
work on that song.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.821
Uh, I got nothing
for that song.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.240
I mean, I got the music
but no lyrics.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.157
You got anything?

13:06.035 --> 13:07.954
Oh, I got somethin'.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.540
Does that mean
what I think it means?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.834
Technically,
it's still the last time.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.003
(blow-dryer whirs)

13:18.673 --> 13:20.008
Go on. Open it.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.553
Look closely.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.263
That is a blade of grass

13:25.263 --> 13:27.598
from the field on my
grandfather's farm in Ireland.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.434
It's the same land
that's been in my family

13:29.434 --> 13:30.893
since before the famine.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.603
I had the grass placed
into the cross

13:32.603 --> 13:34.772
as a token of reconciliation

13:34.772 --> 13:36.149
and friendship.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.734
Oh, my God.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.193
I don't know what to say.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.862
Well, say you'll
come back to the show.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.739
Hector wants
your singular input.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.158
Listen, Sonny.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.619
Am I...
altering your vision?

13:50.204 --> 13:53.916
Yes, but it's still
the same powerful story.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.420
It's still the same passion
that you gave it.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.880
Siobhan, play "Famine Fields."

13:58.880 --> 14:00.089
SIOBHAN: Yes, Campbell.
Playing "Famine"--

14:00.089 --> 14:01.549
Just do it, for God's sake.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.843

14:03.843 --> 14:06.262
There it is.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.390
Campbell is so
on this, brother.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.518
-I'm on it.
-I really dig it, man.

14:53.518 --> 14:56.854
Before we talk any more,
I want to go into the bathroom

14:56.854 --> 14:58.731
and see how this thing
looks on me.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.066
Welcome back, brother.

15:03.778 --> 15:04.904
Love.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.573
Life's greatest weapon, yeah?

15:07.573 --> 15:09.700
Has to be expressed aloud,
though, boyos.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.662
Um, Campbell?

15:12.662 --> 15:13.996
You love me, right?

15:13.996 --> 15:15.957
As if you were
my sibling.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.835
Why? What--
what's the matter?

15:18.835 --> 15:20.294
I don't know;
it's just--

15:20.294 --> 15:21.754
you know, you gave me
these glasses,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.047
which--which I love.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.298
I love these.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.301
And this scarf,
which is fantastic.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.011
But you just gave Sonny--

15:29.011 --> 15:31.514
I don't know; it s--

15:31.514 --> 15:33.015
seems like a more--

15:33.015 --> 15:34.392
I don't know--meaningful gift,
you know?

15:34.392 --> 15:36.060
Hector.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.896
Let me... let me color
in your mind for a second.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.022
Yeah.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.399
On my family farm

15:41.399 --> 15:42.942
in Knockbride, County Cavan,

15:42.942 --> 15:47.113
there are now 47 sheep,

15:47.113 --> 15:50.074
not to be eaten--
to be raised well,

15:50.074 --> 15:52.827
till their coats
are thick with fleece,

15:52.827 --> 15:57.206
and my cousin Seamus, he shears
that fleece with his own...

15:57.206 --> 15:59.959
with the--
the one strong hand.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.919
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

16:01.919 --> 16:06.132
The wool for your scarf
is handspun from that fleece

16:06.132 --> 16:08.426
by my cousin Eileen
and four of her sisters.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.345
Individually combed
and woven by them,

16:11.345 --> 16:15.057
and then Eileen picks the most
precious product every year,

16:15.057 --> 16:17.643
and she sends five
chosen scarves,

16:17.643 --> 16:22.690
only the five finest
scarves, to me

16:22.690 --> 16:26.903
to give as gifts
to those closest to me.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.572
So that scarf

16:29.572 --> 16:33.659
is therefore,
I think, priceless.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.077
-You all right?
-I'm sorry.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.579
No, don't--
don't be sorry.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.039
Hey. It's all right.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.373
Come here.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.751
I understand. I understand.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.753
You deserve, man.
You deserve.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.880
I'm sor--
I'm gonna go.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.131
-Yeah, yeah.
-This okay?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.549
-I just--
-Take a second.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.135
Thank you, Campbell. Oh!

16:51.135 --> 16:54.055
(sighs)

16:59.018 --> 17:01.020
That is really cool, man.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.688
That is really cool.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.691
I wish my family had
that kind of living heritage.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.568
I bought that scarf
at Neiman Marcus.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.196
The blade of grass, I found
in Central Park yesterday

17:10.196 --> 17:12.740
while I was out walking
with my dog, Cracker.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.283
Seamus now.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.494
Is there, like--
is there not a family farm?

17:16.494 --> 17:18.746
There probably is.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.581
In (...) Scotland.

17:20.581 --> 17:21.999
"Campbell Scott"?

17:21.999 --> 17:23.751
Oh, my God.
You're not even Irish.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.045
Well, that's the great
thing about the Method.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.464
As long as this show runs,

17:28.464 --> 17:30.841
no one in New York
will be as Irish as I--

17:30.841 --> 17:32.885
no one in New York City.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.972
No one in New York City

17:35.972 --> 17:37.848

That's too (...) much.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.203
Look at Flash with
his stupid snaky smile.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.746
No, it's not snaky.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.832
It's wide and charming.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.458
It's amazing how handsome

18:05.960 --> 18:07.962
What are you talking about?
Did you guys break up?

18:07.962 --> 18:09.630
No, but I planted the seed.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.048
I told him he should
start seeing people

18:11.048 --> 18:12.091
closer to his own age.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.884
What are you saying that for?

18:13.884 --> 18:15.845
-Ava's close to his own age.
-Okay, forget about Ava.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.430
He and Ava already
had a thing, okay?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.098
He may look happy
on the outside,

18:19.098 --> 18:21.809
but inside he's still
totally obsessing over me.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.562
<i>♪ ♪</i>

18:24.562 --> 18:25.688
-See?
-Yeah.

18:25.688 --> 18:26.856
My money's on Brook.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.608
He's rich, he's handsome,

18:28.608 --> 18:29.984
and, best of all,
he's supportive.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.193
You know what?

18:31.193 --> 18:32.695
You say that word to me
one more time,

18:32.695 --> 18:34.030
I'm gonna puke on one
of these $9-million rugs.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.323
What word?
Supportive?

18:35.323 --> 18:36.490
I don't want
to hear it again.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.617
-Supportive.
-Not funny.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.452
(slowly)
Supportive.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.953
(chuckles)
You know what?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.330
This whole goddamn thing
is your fault.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.623
-You know that, right?
-Are you mad?

18:43.623 --> 18:44.957
No, I'm not mad.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.667
You're gonna
blame this on me?

18:46.667 --> 18:48.127
Okay, listen,
if you hadn't been

18:48.127 --> 18:50.087
in such a rush to watch
that stupid Ava videotape,

18:50.087 --> 18:51.422
we wouldn't have found out
about her and Flash,

18:51.422 --> 18:52.798
and none of this
would've happened, okay?

18:52.798 --> 18:54.383
Oh, my God,
you're so insane.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.760
This all happened
'cause you couldn't keep

18:55.760 --> 18:57.428
your dick in your pants
25 years ago.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.013
Okay, not keeping
my dick in my pants

18:59.013 --> 19:00.806
is how you ended up
on planet Earth, little girl.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.266
Oh, thank you so much.
Why?

19:02.266 --> 19:03.934
So I could go live
on a farm in the middle

19:03.934 --> 19:05.853
of goddamn nowhere, Ohio,
playing piano with my mom?

19:05.853 --> 19:07.772
Do you know what I would've
given to play piano with my dad,

19:07.772 --> 19:10.524
to write a song with my dad
like you and Tenika did today?

19:10.524 --> 19:12.276
I would've signed up
for lupus gladly

19:12.276 --> 19:14.445
if it locked me in the house
with my music legend father.

19:14.445 --> 19:15.946
That's what you
were thinking about

19:15.946 --> 19:18.491
while we were writing
that song with Tenika?

19:18.491 --> 19:20.368
Oh, my God.
So selfish.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.827
Where do you think
I got that from?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.329
(sighs)
Listen.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.539
Do you think I don't regret
not being there for you

19:25.539 --> 19:26.582
when you were growing up?

19:26.582 --> 19:28.084
Yes, I do, okay?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.752
But there's nothing
I can do about it, all right?

19:29.752 --> 19:31.212
I'd have to invent
a time machine

19:31.212 --> 19:32.546
and travel back to 1992

19:32.546 --> 19:34.256
and start the whole thing
over again, okay?

19:34.256 --> 19:36.467
So you basically
have two choices:

19:36.467 --> 19:40.721
one, forgiveness,
or, two, time machine.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.390
What's it gonna be?

19:42.390 --> 19:44.141
Well, as much as I love
that Don Henley song,

19:44.141 --> 19:46.394
I think I'm gonna go
with time machine.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.270
Speaking of which.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.441
GIGI: Oh, wow.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.068
JOHNNY: Oh, man.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.528
Ugh.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.779
Look at them all.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.030
So shiny.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.281
Yeah.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.492
This one's from 1992.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.285
If I could go back in time,

20:03.285 --> 20:04.745
I'd still have you,
but I'd also have one of these

20:04.745 --> 20:06.664
and one of these
and a Grammy.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.874
He probably has all the Grammys
locked up in a vault somewhere.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.334
Yeah, I bet.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.794
These would look
pretty cool on our piano.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.046
-Yep.
-Next to my lupus medication.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.715
Mm.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.133
I want whisky.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.926
I want to drink lots
of whisky right now.

20:18.926 --> 20:19.927
You know what?

20:19.927 --> 20:21.721
I noticed a 25-year-old

20:21.721 --> 20:22.930
single malt Macallan bottle

20:22.930 --> 20:24.640
on that bar back there.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.891
You know what that is?

20:25.891 --> 20:27.852
A very expensive
bottle of booze?

20:27.852 --> 20:30.521
Or a very cheap
time machine.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.356
I'll be right back.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.403
Hey, you see those guys
right there?

20:37.403 --> 20:38.779
Hottest new band in town.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.948
They're like alt-rock surf-pop

20:40.948 --> 20:43.325
meets anthem dance-punk disco.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.870
They're total chick magnets too.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.205
I don't know; the problem with
guys my age in alt-rock bands

20:48.205 --> 20:50.166
is that they all look like
they're about to be shot

20:50.166 --> 20:51.917
for Civil War desertion.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.961
-What's the band called?
-I don't want to tell you.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.463
-Tell me.
-You're not gonna like it.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.506
-Do it.
-Spotsylvania.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.591
Shoot them.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.592
And burn their outfits.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.509
They're--

21:05.639 --> 21:06.974
(sighs)

21:10.978 --> 21:12.646
Oh, you got to be shitting me!

21:12.646 --> 21:14.148
Honey, it's not like
he's gonna miss it.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.858
He's got a ton more up there.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.485
Plus, he's too busy
hittin' on my girlfriend.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.861
We're putting it back.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.154
We're not putting it back,
honey, okay?

21:20.154 --> 21:21.197
I-I deserve this.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.656
The Heathens deserve this.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.617
Remember when we first met him?

21:24.617 --> 21:26.744
He said, in 1992, we should've
won the Best New Artist Grammy?

21:26.744 --> 21:28.746
Well, we would've won
one of these too.

21:28.746 --> 21:29.747
And I'll tell you what.

21:29.747 --> 21:30.998
If I had won one of these,

21:30.998 --> 21:32.374
I would've given
the greatest speech

21:32.374 --> 21:34.293
in the history
of the MTV awards.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.377
Yeah?

21:35.377 --> 21:37.546
Who would you have thanked?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.632
I'm not gonna thank anybody.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.509
-That's the whole thing.
-Ah.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.177
That's like that typical
bullshit that every band does.

21:43.177 --> 21:45.387
I would've gotten up there
and been like, "You know what?

21:45.387 --> 21:47.598
"To all the--
the record company executives

21:47.598 --> 21:49.558
"and all the music
industry assholes

21:49.558 --> 21:51.268
"and all the club owners
and everybody else

21:51.268 --> 21:52.978
"in this business who told me
I was never gonna make it,

21:52.978 --> 21:55.064
"I'd like to say two words--

21:55.064 --> 21:57.107
(...) you."

21:57.107 --> 21:58.108
Shocker.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.401
And then the next day,

21:59.401 --> 22:00.736
it would've been
all over the papers.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.822
Everybody would've
been talking about it.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.782
What, you--you--
you would've been gracious?

22:04.782 --> 22:06.534
-I would've been lovely.
-Oh, yeah.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.035
Let me show you
what I would do.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.495
I would start out
by thanking my loved ones,

22:09.495 --> 22:11.580
my family and my friends.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.083
I would then thank
my amazing band, The Assassins.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.626
You guys are my heartbeat
when I'm out there.

22:15.626 --> 22:16.669
Mm-hmm.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.337
My amazing boyfriend, Flash,

22:18.337 --> 22:19.713
who surrounds me with love

22:19.713 --> 22:21.966
and sexy guitar licks.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.884
My surrogate mom, Ava,

22:23.884 --> 22:25.344
I love you; I need you.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.304
I couldn't have
done this without you.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.265
And last but not least...

22:29.265 --> 22:30.182
(sighs)

22:32.601 --> 22:35.312
My mom.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.439
My real mom, Cat.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.066
'Cause even though we fought

22:39.066 --> 22:42.194
and even though I felt like
she was smothering me,

22:42.194 --> 22:43.863
the truth is,

22:43.863 --> 22:47.449
you were just loving me
twice as hard.

22:47.449 --> 22:50.703
Because unlike the other
little girls out there,

22:50.703 --> 22:54.290
I didn't have a real dad.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.666
Thank you, Jesus!

22:55.666 --> 22:57.793
BROOK: Hey!
What the (...)?

22:57.793 --> 22:59.420
Where do you think you're going
with my Moonman?

23:02.673 --> 23:04.049
-It was his idea.
-No, no.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.010
We--
we weren't going anywhere.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.428
We were just, you know...

23:10.639 --> 23:13.183
We were gonna
take pictures with it.

23:13.183 --> 23:16.937
Just to, you know--
That's all we were gonna do.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.523
We were just gonna take
some selfies with it.
