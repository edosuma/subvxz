YOU KNOW,

11:34.277 --> 11:35.903
WHEN I WAS TURNING 21,

11:35.945 --> 11:38.281

MY INVITATIONS TRIMMED

11:38.323 --> 11:41.409
WITH REAL PEARLS.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.827
I COULD NOT BE CONVINCED

11:42.869 --> 11:45.246
THAT IT WAS AT ALL TACKY

11:42.869 --> 11:45.246
OR IMPRACTICAL.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.832
I WAS RIGHT, AND THAT WAS

11:45.288 --> 11:47.832
THE WAY IT HAD TO BE.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.417
WAS BESIDE HERSELF.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.252

11:49.459 --> 11:51.252
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.671
BUT IN THE END,

11:52.711 --> 11:55.256
SHE FOUND ME INVITATIONS

11:52.711 --> 11:55.256
LINED WITH REAL PEARLS,

11:55.298 --> 11:57.217
AND I FELT LIKE THE MOST

11:55.298 --> 11:57.217

11:57.258 --> 11:58.801
SO, COME ON, TELL ME --

I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.748
YOU DON'T WANT ANY OLD SUSHI

12:27.914 --> 12:29.748
HANGING AROUND.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.125
NOW, WE'LL HAVE A BAR,

12:38.132 --> 12:40.635
I USED TO LOVE

12:38.132 --> 12:40.635
A NICE GIN FIZZ.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.513
AM I BORING YOU?

12:40.677 --> 12:43.513
NO, THE LACE IS FINE.

12:43.555 --> 12:44.763
RORY, WHERE IS

12:43.555 --> 12:44.763

12:44.805 --> 12:46.474
I DON'T KNOW.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.474
I'M SORRY.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.436
THERE ARE A MILLION OTHER

12:46.516 --> 12:49.436
DETAILS I NEED TO GO OVER HERE.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.229
WOULD YOU LIKE ME

12:49.477 --> 12:51.229

12:51.271 --> 12:53.772

13:19.340 --> 13:21.426

13:21.468 --> 13:23.470
PARIS SHOULD BE ON THE LIST.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.470
THEN PARIS IS ON THE LIST.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.179
SHE'LL WANT TO BRING

14:11.309 --> 14:12.811
WHEN HE DROPS

14:12.851 --> 14:14.521
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

14:12.851 --> 14:14.521
WHEN YOU REALLY GET HANGED,

14:14.562 --> 14:15.896
YOUR EYEBALLS

14:14.562 --> 14:15.896
SOMETIMES EXPLODE

14:15.938 --> 14:17.565
AND YOUR TONGUE SPLITS

14:15.938 --> 14:17.565
DOWN THE MIDDLE.

14:17.607 --> 14:18.733
IT'S DISGUSTING.

14:17.607 --> 14:18.733
WANNA SEE?

14:18.775 --> 14:20.777

16:09.343 --> 16:11.095
I'LL WORK ON IT.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.431
BUT ANYWAY, AFTER THAT,

16:21.272 --> 16:23.232
SHOOT OUT OF YOUR NOSE.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.818
AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE DEAD,

I'LL THROW YOU

16:24.859 --> 16:27.194
ONTO THE OPERATING TABLE

16:24.859 --> 16:27.194

16:42.042 --> 16:44.921
HOW EXACTLY DO I GET

16:42.042 --> 16:44.921

16:44.963 --> 16:47.006
MAYBE I CAN POSITION

16:44.963 --> 16:47.006
THE OPERATING TABLE

16:47.047 --> 16:48.508
RIGHT NEAR

16:47.047 --> 16:48.508
THE ELECTRIC CHAIR

16:48.549 --> 16:50.844
SO I CAN JUST FLOP YOU OVER

16:48.549 --> 16:50.844

16:50.885 --> 16:53.012
OKAY, LET'S SAY

NOW I'M ON THE TABLE.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.390
YOU'RE GONNA CUT ME OPEN

16:54.889 --> 16:56.390
WITH WHAT?

16:56.432 --> 16:58.058
A BIG, RUSTY SAW.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.019
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA PULL

16:58.100 --> 17:00.019
LINK SAUSAGES OUT OF ME.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.189
REAL SLOW AND CREEPY-LIKE.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.189
OKAY, GREAT. LAST QUESTION.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.943
CUT ME OPEN,

17:06.985 --> 17:08.695
AND PULL LINK SAUSAGES

17:06.985 --> 17:08.695

17:08.736 --> 17:10.112
'CAUSE I'M THINKING

17:08.736 --> 17:10.112
THEY'RE RIGHT UP THERE

17:10.154 --> 17:11.906
WITH PIA ZADORA

17:10.154 --> 17:11.906

OH, COME ON.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.366
THIS WILL BE FUN.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.201

I TOLD HER MINISTER.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.922
BUT WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

29:58.964 --> 30:00.716
BECAUSE HE WAS GOING

30:00.758 --> 30:02.175
ABOUT MY VIRTUE

30:00.758 --> 30:02.175

31:08.534 --> 31:10.494
MY LEAST FAVORITE DOOR

31:10.536 --> 31:11.787
IN THE WORLD

31:10.536 --> 31:11.787
TO KNOCK ON.

31:11.829 --> 31:13.246
WHAT ABOUT DEATH'S DOOR?

31:13.288 --> 31:16.041
THE RECEPTION ON THE OTHER SIDE

31:13.288 --> 31:16.041
MIGHT BE WARMER.

31:16.082 --> 31:18.043
WELL, AT LEAST

31:16.082 --> 31:18.043
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO KNOCK.

31:18.084 --> 31:20.462
READY?

31:18.084 --> 31:20.462
I WAS BORN READY.

31:20.504 --> 31:23.382
AH, NICE,

31:20.504 --> 31:23.382
LOW-KEY AFFAIR.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.643
INTO THE HOUSE NOW.

31:34.685 --> 31:35.811
WHAT IS THIS?

31:34.685 --> 31:35.811

31:39.857 --> 31:41.107

31:45.821 --> 31:47.364

31:48.866 --> 31:50.950
A CHOCOLATE BOX FOR YOU.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.911

32:07.634 --> 32:09.386
NO ONE'S ASKING YOU

32:07.634 --> 32:09.386

32:09.428 --> 32:11.555
I KNOW. I JUST --

32:25.736 --> 32:27.195
GOD, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

32:27.237 --> 32:30.908
IT'S LIKE DRINKING

32:27.237 --> 32:30.908
A "MY LITTLE PONY."

32:35.328 --> 32:37.163
HEY, I'M GLAD

32:35.328 --> 32:37.163
YOU GUYS CAME.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.374
WE HAD TO STOP AND EAT FIRST

32:37.205 --> 32:39.374
IN CASE THE FOOD HERE SUCKED.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.876
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RORY.

32:44.671 --> 32:45.839
AND DON'T EMBELLISH.

AS YOU KNOW,

32:45.881 --> 32:47.549
I'M A SENIOR,

32:49.927 --> 32:51.929
AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.222
I'M GOING BACK

32:51.970 --> 32:54.222
TO WRITING FULL-TIME.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.222
WOW.

ACCORDING TO DOYLE."

32:57.768 --> 33:00.103
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE<i> DAILY NEWS </i>

32:57.768 --> 33:00.103
WITHOUT YOU AS EDITOR.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.939
YEAH,

33:00.145 --> 33:01.939
IT'S GOING TO BE WEIRD.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.565
ASK WHO

33:01.980 --> 33:03.565
THE NEW EDITOR IS.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.651
WHO'S THE NEW EDITOR

33:03.607 --> 33:05.651
GOING TO BE?

33:03.607 --> 33:05.651
ME.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.694
YOU?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.694
THAT'S RIGHT.

PARIS GELLER IS THE NEW EDITOR

33:07.736 --> 33:10.196
OF THE<i> YALE DAILY NEWS.</i>

33:10.238 --> 33:12.324
I WAS WORRIED

33:10.238 --> 33:12.324
ABOUT THE INTIMIDATION FACTOR

33:12.365 --> 33:14.200
'CAUSE PEOPLE TEND

33:12.365 --> 33:14.200
TO BE AFRAID OF ME,

33:14.242 --> 33:16.912
BUT I REALLY WORKED THE "MY

33:14.242 --> 33:16.912
PARENTS LEFT ME BROKE" ANGLE,

33:16.954 --> 33:18.371
GOT A LITTLE

33:16.954 --> 33:18.371
SYMPATHY VOTE,

33:18.413 --> 33:20.290
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

33:18.413 --> 33:20.290
I AM THE MAN.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.168
MY WOMAN IS THE MAN.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.168
I MEAN, IT'S SO INCREDIBLE.

33:23.209 --> 33:26.296
LAST YEAR, I WAS SLEEPING

33:23.209 --> 33:26.296
WITH THE EDITOR.

33:23.209 --> 33:26.296
AND THIS YEAR, I AM.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.089
I CAN'T WAIT.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.089
THE CHANGES I'M GOING TO MAKE.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.758
HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS,

33:28.131 --> 33:29.758
PEOPLE.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.760
I'M GOING TO CRACK THAT WHIP,

33:29.800 --> 33:31.760
RAISE THAT BAR.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.846
THE LAST PERSON THAT RAN

33:31.802 --> 33:33.846
THE SHOP WAS TOO BUSY

33:33.887 --> 33:35.973
IRONING HIS PETTICOAT

33:33.887 --> 33:35.973
TO PUT OUT A DECENT PAPER.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.724
THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.724
YOU KNOW IT IS.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.768
HEY, EVERYONE.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.768

HEY, LORELAI. YOU REMEMBER

33:39.810 --> 33:41.812
MY BOYFRIEND, DOYLE?

33:41.854 --> 33:44.022
GOOD TO SEE YOU. THIS IS LUKE.

33:41.854 --> 33:44.022
NICE TO MEET YOU, LUKE.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.983

33:44.063 --> 33:45.983

34:43.540 --> 34:46.125
THE RED PIECE DOWN.

34:58.972 --> 35:01.934
I DIDN'T REALIZE SHE RAN

34:58.972 --> 35:01.934
WITH THE BAD GIRLS.

35:01.975 --> 35:04.853
WE JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

35:18.075 --> 35:20.869
I'M GOOD.

35:18.075 --> 35:20.869
OKAY, I'LL BE BACK.

HEY, LITTLE TIP --

35:33.715 --> 35:35.842
WE HAVE BEER HERE.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.218
OH, THE MAGIC WORDS.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.178
I WAS JUST HEADING

35:37.260 --> 35:39.178
OVER TO THE BAR.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.513
HAVE YOU TRIED A RORY YET?

35:40.555 --> 35:42.849
YES, I HAVE.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.849
NOT MY KIND OF DRINK.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.101
YEAH, MINE, EITHER.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.103
LORELAI WILL BE GLAD

35:44.142 --> 35:46.103
TO HEAR IT.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.854
SO, YOU TWO

35:49.314 --> 35:51.858
WELL, IT WAS NICE OF YOU

35:49.314 --> 35:51.858
TO INVITE HER HERE.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.444
I'M GLAD SHE CAME.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.444
I'M GLAD YOU BOTH CAME.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.073
OH, UH, HERE.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.073
I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.241
BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.241
REALLY?

36:00.283 --> 36:01.618
I BROUGHT IT IN CASE

36:00.283 --> 36:01.618
YOUR MOTHER DIDN'T BRING ONE,

36:01.660 --> 36:03.286
BUT SHE DID.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.622
IT'S ON TOP OF YOUR

36:03.328 --> 36:05.622
PRESENT MOUNTAIN OVER THERE.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.959
BUT SINCE I ALREADY HAD IT

36:05.664 --> 36:08.959
IN MY POCKET, I JUST FIGURED...

36:09.001 --> 36:11.210
LUKE.

36:09.001 --> 36:11.210
IT WAS MY MOTHER'S.

36:11.252 --> 36:13.171
LIZ CAN'T WEAR IT

36:11.252 --> 36:13.171
'CAUSE HER NECK'S TOO FAT,

36:13.212 --> 36:14.881
BUT YOUR NECK LOOKS,

36:13.212 --> 36:14.881
YOU KNOW, NOT FAT.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.174
IT WAS SITTING AROUND

36:14.923 --> 36:16.174
IN MY DRAWER,

36:16.215 --> 36:18.135
SO I THOUGHT,

36:16.215 --> 36:18.135
"HEY, GIVE IT TO RORY."

36:18.176 --> 36:20.971
YOU'RE LUCKY 'CAUSE CAESAR'S

36:18.176 --> 36:20.971
BIRTHDAY IS NEXT MONTH

36:21.013 --> 36:22.806

36:21.013 --> 36:22.806

36:22.848 --> 36:24.099
THANK YOU.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.099
YOU'RE WELCOME.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.561
I SAW A JEWELRY BOX

36:26.685 --> 36:28.561
AND I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

36:28.603 --> 36:32.024
WHAT DID YOU GET?

36:28.603 --> 36:32.024
OH, IT'S FANTASTIC.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.067
IT'S FROM LUKE,

36:32.065 --> 36:34.067
MY STEPFATHER-TO-BE.

WHERE'S LUKE? I HOPE HE DIDN'T

36:51.835 --> 36:53.962
GET LOST SOMEWHERE.

36:54.004 --> 36:55.588
OH, NO, I'M SURE

36:54.004 --> 36:55.588
HE'S JUST SIZING UP

36:55.630 --> 36:57.465
HOW MUCH SILVER HE CAN STUFF

36:55.630 --> 36:57.465
INTO HIS POCKETS

36:57.507 --> 36:59.092
WITHOUT IT MAKING

36:57.507 --> 36:59.092
TOO MUCH OF A BULGE.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.760
I WAS NOT INSINUATING

36:59.134 --> 37:00.760
THAT HE WAS A THIEF.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.012
AH.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.597
I WAS JUST MAKING SMALL,

POLITE TALK.

37:04.639 --> 37:07.392
MY COMMENTING ON HIS GETTING

37:04.639 --> 37:07.392

38:11.998 --> 38:13.959
