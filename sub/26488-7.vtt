WEBVTT

00:07.137 --> 00:09.183
PILOT: Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now beginning our descent

00:09.226 --> 00:10.749
into Vientiane, Laos,

00:10.793 --> 00:13.404
where the current temperature
is a beautiful 86 degrees.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.059
Flight attendants,
please prepare for landing.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.713
MAN:
We'’ll be holding her soon.

00:17.756 --> 00:21.412
Our very own baby girl.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.297
I hope it fits.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.864
It'’s a scarf.[chuckles]

00:38.908 --> 00:41.041
I just want Ailani to know
how much we appreciate

00:41.084 --> 00:42.346
what she'’s doing for us.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.131
Oh, after nine
months of e-mails,

00:44.174 --> 00:46.046
video chats and care packages,

00:46.089 --> 00:48.309
I'’m pretty sure
she knows, honey.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.876
But everyone needs
a scarf, right?

00:50.920 --> 00:52.356
[both chuckle]

00:52.400 --> 00:54.358
We'’re having a baby.[chuckles]

00:54.402 --> 00:55.751
Uh, it should be

00:55.794 --> 00:57.448
just up here on the right.

01:09.982 --> 01:11.767
[speaking Lao]

01:11.810 --> 01:12.637
What are you doing
with those women?

01:15.684 --> 01:18.774
Uh, sorry, Officer.
Wrong address.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.920
But that'’s our baby.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.144
WOMAN: The Trafficking
In Persons Report

01:41.188 --> 01:42.450
shows that
while several countries

01:42.493 --> 01:44.713
with problematic
histories vis-à-vis

01:44.756 --> 01:47.150
human trafficking have managed
to improve their behavior

01:47.194 --> 01:49.413
and move up to Tier 1 status

01:49.457 --> 01:51.502
while several others

01:51.546 --> 01:54.026
have unfortunately
slid down to Tier 2

01:54.070 --> 01:55.898
or Tier 3.

01:55.941 --> 01:58.292
And overall, the number
of trafficking victims

01:58.335 --> 02:00.859
worldwide has...Doubled, sir. Yes.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.818
That'’s it, then.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.994
I'’ve seen enough.

02:05.037 --> 02:07.127
We'’re withholding aid
to all Tier 3 countries.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.694
Mr. President, that could have
negative effects

02:09.738 --> 02:12.219
on populations in need
around the globe.

02:12.262 --> 02:15.004
The more fair move
would be to evaluate

02:15.047 --> 02:17.659
each nation
on a case by case basis.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.878
Fair?

02:19.922 --> 02:22.054
800,000 people
are ripped from their homes

02:22.098 --> 02:23.926
every year and
sold into slavery.

02:23.969 --> 02:26.189
I want fairness for them.
And the only way to achieve that

02:26.233 --> 02:29.453
is punish the countries
that allow their exploitation

02:29.497 --> 02:32.239
to continue.ELIZABETH: Well, the
release of the report

02:32.282 --> 02:33.805
itself is yielding results.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.111
TERESA:
I assume you'’re talking about

02:35.155 --> 02:37.026
the crackdowns in Laos.Exactly.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.897
Laos reacted immediately,

02:38.941 --> 02:41.291
breaking up trafficking
operations across the country.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.640
RUSSELL: Nothing like the
threat of losing aid

02:42.684 --> 02:44.207
to make a country
grow a conscience.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.209
Which proves my point.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.080
Shutting off the money spigot
so that they feel it,

02:48.124 --> 02:49.517
so that it hurts.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.519
That'’s how you get
change that lasts.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.260
And that'’s what
we'’re going to do.

02:53.303 --> 02:54.522
Thanks, Shira.

02:54.565 --> 02:57.002
Thanks, everyone.

02:57.046 --> 03:00.702
Sir, my office heard from
former constituents of mine.

03:00.745 --> 03:04.662
A couple. Apparently, Laos is
also rounding up pregnant women.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.229
Surrogates.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.796
Well, that'’s not
too surprising.

03:07.839 --> 03:11.147
Unfortunately, Laos categorizes
commercial surrogacy

03:11.191 --> 03:12.583
as human trafficking.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.063
TERESA:
Mr. President, this
couple is desperate.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.630
They can'’t locate
their surrogate.

03:15.673 --> 03:18.241
and she is due to have
their baby any day now.

03:18.285 --> 03:21.244
Do we know how many surrogates
in total have been arrested?

03:21.288 --> 03:23.246
Laos is a hotspot
for fertility tourists,

03:23.290 --> 03:25.379
so it could be
hundreds of women.

03:25.422 --> 03:28.817
Unjustly imprisoned without
access to proper prenatal care.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.471
I think we should
do something to help.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.777
A statement from the
president of the United States

03:32.821 --> 03:34.605
could go a long way.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.085
TERESA:
Maybe even de-stigmatize

03:36.128 --> 03:38.000
surrogacy a little
in the process.

03:38.043 --> 03:40.655
Look, even if we could
convince Laos

03:40.698 --> 03:43.266
to ignore their own laws,
here at home,

03:43.310 --> 03:44.615
commercial surrogacy
is one of those issues

03:44.659 --> 03:45.834
most folks
don'’t think about much.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.749
But when they do, they hate it.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.054
DALTON:
I think it'’s fair
to say that there'’s

03:49.098 --> 03:51.056
no national
consensus on this.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.102
That'’s why it's regulated
at the state level.

03:53.145 --> 03:56.453
This is complex
ethical territory.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.107
Most surrogates come from
low-income backgrounds

03:58.150 --> 04:00.457
so it'’s easily seen
as class exploitation.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.154
And then there are the babies,
both born and unborn,

04:02.198 --> 04:04.287
so it'’s a children's
rights issue.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.723
It'’s also an issue of

04:05.767 --> 04:07.943
reproductive rights.
If a woman wants

04:07.986 --> 04:09.597
to carry a child
for someone else,

04:09.640 --> 04:11.207
that should be her choice.RUSSELL: See?

04:11.251 --> 04:14.297
It'’s an issue both liberals
and conservatives can hate.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.603
Best to leave it alone.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.213
Or we could forget about
the politics for once

04:17.257 --> 04:18.562
and just talk
about what'’s right.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.651
Teresa, the day you forget
about the politics

04:20.695 --> 04:22.827
is the day I forget about
the politics.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.917
[scoffs] Yes, Russell,
I am ambitious.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.529
But that doesn'’t mean
I'’m heartless.

04:28.572 --> 04:32.141
What? It was a compliment.Bess, have State

04:32.184 --> 04:34.361
keep an eye on the surrogates,

04:34.404 --> 04:37.538
make sure no human rights
are violated. Beyond that,Yeah.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.322
I'’m sorry, Teresa,
we'’re staying out of this.

04:44.109 --> 04:45.328
Back to the office.Sure.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.764
Elizabeth, do you have a minute?

04:46.808 --> 04:48.070
Uh, yeah.Mm-hmm.

04:50.072 --> 04:52.422
Um...

04:52.466 --> 04:54.816
this is a, uh,
a personal matter.

04:54.859 --> 04:57.253
Okay.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.777
You and I have our
issues, I know that,

04:59.821 --> 05:01.649
but I just didn'’t know
where else to turn.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.868
Are you okay?

05:03.912 --> 05:06.131
The couple I mentioned--

05:06.175 --> 05:08.133
my constituents?

05:08.177 --> 05:11.528
They'’re my daughter and
son-in-law, Lyla and Charlie.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.008
Oh...

05:13.051 --> 05:15.967
I'’m so sorry.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.969
They'’ve been trying to
have a child for years.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.450
And there'’s been a
lot of disappointments

05:20.494 --> 05:22.365
along the way, so they
kept me in the dark

05:22.409 --> 05:24.541
about their plans
until recently.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.978
They didn'’t want to
get anyone'’s hopes up.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.806
And I can understand that.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.939
Of course, they knew what
the law was in Laos,

05:30.982 --> 05:33.202
but they have spent so
much money trying to have

05:33.245 --> 05:35.770
their own child that they
couldn'’t afford a surrogate

05:35.813 --> 05:38.599
in the U.S. and it just seemed
like a safe enough bet.

05:38.642 --> 05:41.950
Well, and it was, until our
report incited that crackdown.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.778
And their surrogate,

05:43.821 --> 05:45.780
Ailani...

05:45.823 --> 05:47.738
is a week away
from her due date

05:47.782 --> 05:50.262
and now she'’s in a
jail somewhere.

05:50.306 --> 05:53.048
I'’m sorry to pull
you into this,

05:53.091 --> 05:55.790
but I'’m not asking for your
help as a vice president.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.227
I'’m-I'm coming to you as a
mother and a grandmother.

05:58.270 --> 06:01.448
But Teresa, you-you
arethe vice president.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.972
Why didn'’t you say
anything to POTUS?

06:04.015 --> 06:05.452
Wh...Because Russell
is right--

06:05.495 --> 06:06.844
the politics are
complicated

06:06.888 --> 06:08.629
and I didn'’t want to
saddle the administration

06:08.672 --> 06:11.414
with the appearance of
a conflict of interest.

06:11.458 --> 06:15.113
And, also, we
both know that

06:15.157 --> 06:18.421
they want you, not me,
to succeed Conrad.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.901
And frankly, I
don'’t trust Russell

06:19.944 --> 06:21.163
not to use this
against me.

06:22.904 --> 06:25.689
But you trust me not to?

06:25.733 --> 06:29.301
Well, we'’ll be in the ring
soon enough, and God knows

06:29.345 --> 06:31.260
you give as good as
you get. [chuckles][laughs]

06:31.303 --> 06:34.002
But yes, I do.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.659
I can'’t make any guarantees,
but I'’ll look into it,

06:38.702 --> 06:40.661
see what I can do
and I will keep this

06:40.704 --> 06:43.533
between the two of us.Thank you.

06:43.577 --> 06:46.362
Blake, where are we on the
Peace Garden reopening ceremony?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.929
Uh the gardeners
from Japan are still

06:47.972 --> 06:50.932
shin-high in bonsai,
apparently, the garden

06:50.975 --> 06:53.195
was in a shameful state of
disrepair-- their words.

06:53.238 --> 06:54.762
But the reopening ceremony'’s
on schedule, right?

06:54.805 --> 06:56.546
We'’ve got guests
coming in from all over.Yes.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.461
Yeah, high-level dignitaries
across the board,

06:58.505 --> 07:00.332
like our very own
Dr. Henry McCord,

07:00.376 --> 07:02.378
who'’s joining the secretary.The date is set
for the day after

07:02.422 --> 07:03.727
tomorrow, we'’ve already
confirmed with

07:03.771 --> 07:05.860
the Japanese embassy
and National Park Service.

07:05.903 --> 07:07.296
So far everything'’s
on track.

07:07.339 --> 07:08.558
Good. Matt,Huh?

07:08.602 --> 07:09.777
How are M-Sec'’s
remarks coming along?

07:09.820 --> 07:11.126
Uh...
[clears throat]

07:11.169 --> 07:12.867
"In the wake of the most
destructive conflict

07:12.910 --> 07:15.130
"in human history,
Japan built gardens

07:15.173 --> 07:17.132
"across the globe
to demonstrate

07:17.175 --> 07:19.308
"its commitment to peace
and friendship.

07:19.351 --> 07:21.789
"Repairing those
that have fallen into disarray

07:21.832 --> 07:23.921
"is an opportunity
for Japan to remind the world

07:23.965 --> 07:26.358
"of our shared
responsibility to ensure

07:26.402 --> 07:28.535
"that the ideals
these gardens symbolize

07:28.578 --> 07:30.275
"continue to blossom."

07:30.319 --> 07:32.756
Uh, then, something, something,

07:32.800 --> 07:35.150
Earth as a
shared garden metaphor,

07:35.193 --> 07:37.152
Uh, poetry, poetry, poetry.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.893
Followed by
a touching conclusion.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.242
Then we eat sushi

07:40.285 --> 07:41.635
and check out koi ponds.Sounds good.

07:41.678 --> 07:42.505
Thanks, everybody.Uh-huh.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.028
Thank you.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.944
"Poetry, poetry, poetry"
was especially moving.

07:46.988 --> 07:47.902
It will be.BLAKE: Oh, Jay.

07:47.945 --> 07:51.427
One last thing.
[sighs]

07:53.647 --> 07:55.300
You shouldn'’t have.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.433
[scoffs]
I didn'’t.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.739
Mr. Usuki,
I'’m guessing?

07:58.782 --> 08:01.176
Yes, our favorite video game
mogul strikes again.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.612
He'’s still angling
for a one-on-one

08:02.656 --> 08:04.832
with the secretary to discuss
international investments.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.268
The watch has to go back.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.836
Yeah, just like the Beyoncé
tickets and the Akita.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.054
I'’ve been trying.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.491
His office keeps
returning it,

08:11.534 --> 08:14.972
insisting it'’s a token of
appreciation, not a bribe.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.800
So kick it to the
Protocol Gifts unit.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.673
If Mr. Usuki wants his
$5,000 watch to molder

08:19.716 --> 08:21.762
in a National Archives
warehouse, that'’s fine with me.

08:21.805 --> 08:24.939
$5,000? Jay.
You'’re so...

08:25.983 --> 08:29.204
...poor.
PGU won'’t take it.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.162
They say they only deal with
gifts from other governments.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.904
Mr. Usuki is just joining
the Japanese Ambassador

08:33.948 --> 08:35.776
as his guest.[phone chimes]

08:35.819 --> 08:37.560
All right, I go to meet
with the secretary.Yeah.

08:37.604 --> 08:38.996
Make sure Usuki knows
there will be

08:39.040 --> 08:40.737
no pull-asides at the garden...
Hey, wait.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.783
No, no. Like, so...

08:42.826 --> 08:45.525
How much is it worth?

08:48.484 --> 08:51.618
Oh! [short chuckle]

08:51.661 --> 08:52.880
That'’s more than my car.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.362
[sighs]
I really am poor.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.323
Based on initial reports,

09:01.366 --> 09:04.456
over 200 pregnant women
were rounded up.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.328
Any idea why Laos
would respond like this

09:06.371 --> 09:07.590
to the TIP
Report, Donna?

09:07.634 --> 09:11.028
The crackdowns
are only partly due to TIP.

09:11.072 --> 09:13.509
Like other countries
that have banned

09:13.553 --> 09:15.859
commercial surrogacy, Laos
is concerned about the optics.

09:15.903 --> 09:19.646
Our embassy in Vientiane
has obviously protested

09:19.689 --> 09:22.649
the surrogates'’
treatment, but, uh....

09:22.692 --> 09:25.347
should I be doing more, ma'’am?

09:25.390 --> 09:28.350
You'’re wondering why I'm here.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.526
I just want to be sure

09:30.570 --> 09:34.095
that we communicate,
in the strongest possible terms,

09:34.138 --> 09:37.446
that the U.S. is invested
in the health and safety

09:37.489 --> 09:39.013
of all of those
surrogates.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.710
Will do ,ma'’am.
I'’m on it.

09:40.754 --> 09:41.972
Thank you, Donna.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.722
Don'’t give me the look.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.724
Yes, you'’re right, there
is more to the story.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.030
What look?

09:56.073 --> 09:57.945
I need a favor.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.729
I need you to find one
surrogate in particular.

09:59.773 --> 10:02.863
Her name is Ailani Lo.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.560
Ailani Lo.
I'’ll get into it.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.171
Obviously, there are
underlying reasons which

10:07.215 --> 10:10.740
I can'’t get into right now.
So I'’m just going to ask for

10:10.784 --> 10:12.612
your trust and
discretion, okay?

10:12.655 --> 10:13.961
Of course, ma'’am.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.964
Thank you.[elevator dings]

10:17.007 --> 10:18.835
That'’s the look,
by the way.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.099
[knocking]

10:24.014 --> 10:25.973
Thanks for squeezing me
in, Henry.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.410
Hey, once CIA, always CIA.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.760
Ephraim, good to see you.
What can I do for you?

10:30.804 --> 10:31.892
I realize what
I'’m about to

10:31.935 --> 10:34.677
show you will feel
oddly reminiscent.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.597
Why are agents keeping tabs

10:41.641 --> 10:42.598
on my daughter?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.600
We came upon Stevie
by accident

10:44.644 --> 10:45.993
while doing routine

10:46.036 --> 10:49.344
surveillance on Dmitri
Petrov'’s sister, Talia.

10:50.432 --> 10:51.738
Talia knows better than that.

10:51.781 --> 10:52.782
She'’s not supposed
to have contact

10:52.826 --> 10:54.697
with any member of my family.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.394
Could this be a coincidence?

10:56.438 --> 10:58.222
Oh, we went back and...

10:58.266 --> 11:00.964
reviewed footage from
earlier in the day.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.183
Talia followed

11:02.226 --> 11:05.708
Stevie to the cafe
from the White House.

11:07.928 --> 11:11.105
We'’ve run the options
for why she'’s back

11:11.148 --> 11:14.499
in the picture, and
only one makes sense.

11:14.543 --> 11:17.285
You think
she'’s working for Russia?

11:17.328 --> 11:18.721
They could be
leveraging her.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.028
Right now, all we know
is that she'’s spying

11:21.071 --> 11:23.247
on your daughter.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.858
Where is Stevie now?

11:24.901 --> 11:26.468
Tell me you'’ve got
a detail on her.

11:26.511 --> 11:27.817
A covert detail.

11:27.861 --> 11:28.862
Plainclothes agents.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.298
She has no idea.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.082
Which is what we want.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.301
At this point,

11:33.344 --> 11:34.737
our advantage is
that the Russians

11:34.781 --> 11:36.130
don'’t know
we'’re onto them.

11:36.173 --> 11:39.046
We need to bring her in,
get her in a safe house.

11:39.089 --> 11:42.266
I'’m confident
she'’s in no immediate danger.

11:42.310 --> 11:45.574
The Russians came after
Dmitri Petrov on U.S. soil

11:45.617 --> 11:47.097
because he was one of their own

11:47.141 --> 11:48.708
who'’d turned traitor.

11:48.751 --> 11:51.188
I don'’t think we know anymore
what Russia is

11:51.232 --> 11:53.887
or isn'’t capable of.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.759
We need answers.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.239
We need to talk to Talia Petrov.

12:16.823 --> 12:20.304
Y-Yes. Sadly, its beauty doesn'’t
make it any less illegal.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.741
We can'’t accept
these kinds of gifts

12:21.784 --> 12:23.873
from Mr. Usuki
or anyone.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.309
Yes.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.920
Well, with my utmost respect,

12:26.963 --> 12:28.617
someone needs to come and
pick this thing up today.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.314
No, don'’t put
me on hold.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.708
Don'’t put...

12:32.752 --> 12:34.928
[clears throat]
Ken.I'’m early.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.147
My apologies.Oh, you are right on
time. We have plenty

12:37.191 --> 12:38.758
to go over before
Maddie gets here.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.368
KEN: The ambassador
will do the welcome,

12:40.411 --> 12:41.978
then I'’ll introduce
the secretary...Gentlemen.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.632
Ah, Maddie Klapper,

12:43.675 --> 12:45.634
National Park Service
Coordinator extraordinaire,

12:45.677 --> 12:46.678
meet Ken Yoshino,

12:46.722 --> 12:47.897
our outstanding
liaison

12:47.941 --> 12:49.551
with the Japanese Embassy.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.335
It'’s a pleasure to meet you.Let'’s see

12:51.379 --> 12:52.467
if you still feel that way
when we'’re done.

12:52.510 --> 12:53.685
Your team

12:53.729 --> 12:54.774
sent over
the manual

12:54.817 --> 12:56.427
for the garden upkeep.

12:56.471 --> 13:00.910
A 2,200-page PDF file
that I printed out.

13:00.954 --> 13:04.174
Used almost four
ink cartridges.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.828
And a two-hour

13:05.872 --> 13:06.829
VR experience,

13:06.873 --> 13:08.178
which is actually pretty cool.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.876
[chuckles]
A-As intended,

13:09.919 --> 13:11.181
the garden will be maintained

13:11.225 --> 13:12.182
for years
to come.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.488
Three to five years,
tops,

13:13.531 --> 13:15.098
according to our accountant.

13:15.142 --> 13:17.492
I'’m not following.I get why

13:17.535 --> 13:19.799
the garden requires such
thoughtful attention.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.191
But we don'’t have
the budget to care

13:21.235 --> 13:23.280
for it.Uh,

13:23.324 --> 13:25.282
what dowe have
the budget for?

13:25.326 --> 13:27.328
A garden a third
of the size.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.633
Less koi ponds.

13:28.677 --> 13:31.245
Less... everything.

13:31.288 --> 13:34.030
My government has invested
much time and money

13:34.074 --> 13:35.205
in this living tribute to peace

13:35.249 --> 13:36.990
and unity.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.252
Your unwillingness
to maintain it

13:38.295 --> 13:39.688
is disrespectful
and unacceptable.

13:39.731 --> 13:42.473
Oh, Ken, I-I'’m sure
we can resolve this.Good.

13:42.517 --> 13:43.692
'’Cause if you don't,

13:43.735 --> 13:45.563
my superiors will
cancel the ceremony.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.046
JAY:
Great.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.656
Great. Thanks.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.571
Ma'’am?

13:55.747 --> 13:58.838
Maggie used
her grandma'’s recipe.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.144
It would be rude
not to eat '’em.

14:03.146 --> 14:04.539
I was gonna share.I'’m not giving
you the look.

14:04.582 --> 14:07.324
I-I just wanted to
share a-a Laos update.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.979
Oh.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.807
About 260 surrogates
are being held,

14:11.851 --> 14:14.027
36 carrying
American babies.And the rest?

14:14.070 --> 14:15.898
The intended parents
are from all over.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.466
The UK, Israel,
Australia, China.

14:18.509 --> 14:21.730
What about the legal status
of the surrogates themselves?

14:21.773 --> 14:22.949
They'’re awaiting
sentencing

14:22.992 --> 14:24.385
while they prosecute
ringleaders first.

14:24.428 --> 14:27.127
So there'’s still time
to negotiate their release

14:27.170 --> 14:30.347
without meddling too much
in a sovereign nation'’s

14:30.391 --> 14:31.522
judicial system.That'’s right.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.915
And I found Ailani.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.092
Uh, in a detention center
in Vientiane.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.660
Oh. Great work, Jay,

14:38.703 --> 14:40.270
on everything.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.490
Thanks. Not like any of this
will stop pregnant women

14:42.533 --> 14:44.231
from being locked up
in the next crackdown.

14:44.274 --> 14:47.277
Well, it'’s not fair.

14:47.321 --> 14:50.715
Most legal systems aren'’t,
when it comes to women.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.369
But this is the best
that we can do for now.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.852
People are so concerned
about exploiting women,

14:56.896 --> 14:59.289
and yet banning it is
not fixing the problem.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.727
We need an international...

15:02.771 --> 15:05.730
set of standards
to-to regulate the industry

15:05.774 --> 15:07.732
and protect
all parties.

15:07.776 --> 15:08.777
I agree.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.344
But locking down
countries for that

15:10.387 --> 15:11.954
would be like herding cats.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.956
With rabies.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.958
Although...

15:16.002 --> 15:19.962
some very influential nations
have surrogates pregnant

15:20.006 --> 15:22.834
with their unborn citizens
in Lao detention centers

15:22.878 --> 15:25.141
right now.Which could make
them amenable,

15:25.185 --> 15:26.316
at least, to hearing
a framework.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.796
We may be able
to solve both problems.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.798
Right.Let'’s just say

15:29.841 --> 15:32.192
I'’m able to form

15:32.235 --> 15:33.889
a coalition
of countries.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.891
And then I invite Laos

15:35.935 --> 15:38.459
to be a part
of the international process.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.026
They'’re concerned
about optics.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.897
This looks a lot better than
throwing pregnant women in jail.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.769
I'’m sold. But
will Laos buy it?

15:44.813 --> 15:49.383
I need to go herd
some rabid cats.

15:49.426 --> 15:50.906
By working with our allies,
we can advocate

15:50.950 --> 15:52.647
for all
the surrogates.

15:52.690 --> 15:55.476
While also working
towards decriminalizing

15:55.519 --> 15:58.044
commercial surrogacy
worldwide?

15:58.087 --> 16:01.090
I know.
It-it sounds ambitious.

16:01.134 --> 16:04.006
But I'’m already getting buy-in
from other countries.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.400
It'’s a pipe dream,
Elizabeth.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.141
Helping surrogates who are
carrying American babies

16:08.184 --> 16:09.403
is difficult enough.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.057
We need to focus on that.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.581
Without the aid package,
there'’s no leverage.

16:13.624 --> 16:17.019
Forming a coalition--
that'’s how we save everyone.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.760
It'’s not our job
to save everyone.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.588
You know what I'’m
up against here.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.372
I understand you'’re upset.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.418
But now we know
where Ailani is, and...

16:24.461 --> 16:26.855
Yes, and I thank you
for that. But right now,

16:26.898 --> 16:29.597
the woman about to give
birth to my grandchild

16:29.640 --> 16:32.469
is sitting in a
squalid jail cell.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.777
You asked for my help.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.474
Now you'’re gonna have
to trust me.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.312
Hi.Hi.

16:49.356 --> 16:50.922
You'’re new here.First day.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.054
What can I get you?

16:52.098 --> 16:53.795
Large chai latte.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.579
Almond milk.

17:02.586 --> 17:03.674
Talia.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.852
We need to talk.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.468
Why were you following
my daughter?

17:14.511 --> 17:18.646
Did someone
put you up to this?

17:18.689 --> 17:20.691
I can only help you
if you tell me the truth.

17:24.956 --> 17:26.567
It was Dmitri.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.134
He heard about
the White House attack.

17:28.177 --> 17:29.178
He was worried

17:29.222 --> 17:31.050
and wanted to know
she was okay.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.140
But you spent an entire day

17:34.183 --> 17:35.880
trailing her around the city.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.969
I'’ve never followed
someone before.

17:38.013 --> 17:41.016
It took time to get
close enough to make sure

17:41.060 --> 17:44.541
she has, like, all her fingers
and toes, you know?

17:44.585 --> 17:45.803
She'’s a fast walker.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.373
I told him it was
stupid idea.

17:50.417 --> 17:51.940
And that'’s it?

17:51.983 --> 17:54.725
There'’s nothing else?I swear.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.902
Dmitri has been
through so much.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.514
When he asks for something,
how can I not do it?

18:03.169 --> 18:07.086
Dr. McCord...

18:07.129 --> 18:10.785
I like my life here.

18:10.828 --> 18:13.092
What'’s going to
happen to me now?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.487
You'’re gonna leave out the
back door with these agents.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.272
They'’re gonna ask you
a few more questions.

18:19.315 --> 18:22.144
If your story clears,
then you'’ll be free to go.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.668
But, no matter what,
your life'’s gonna

18:24.712 --> 18:27.062
be under a microscope
for a while.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.587
For what it'’s worth...
I believe you.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.158
HENRY:
So, Talia'’s story

18:36.202 --> 18:37.377
checked out.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.901
I should hope so.

18:39.944 --> 18:42.295
Pretty lame lie, otherwise.

18:44.297 --> 18:47.604
She really say that thing
about fingers and toes?

18:47.648 --> 18:49.258
She did.

18:49.302 --> 18:50.738
And, technically,
Dmitri didn'’t

18:50.781 --> 18:53.480
violate his deal, so he
got off with a warning.

18:53.523 --> 18:56.309
Still, he took a big
risk to make sure

18:56.352 --> 18:59.486
that Stevie was okay.

18:59.529 --> 19:00.748
It'’s kind of sweet.

19:00.791 --> 19:01.836
It was reckless.

19:01.879 --> 19:05.144
Oh, you'’d do the same.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.016
If you were a former
Russian double agent

19:08.059 --> 19:11.759
exiled to the tundra,
concerned for my safety,

19:11.802 --> 19:15.110
but unable to
contact me directly...

19:15.154 --> 19:17.330
[laughs] Don'’t make it sound
like an airport novel, okay?

19:17.373 --> 19:18.418
But, yes, absolutely.

19:18.461 --> 19:21.203
Yeah.No question.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.423
But this is different.
It'’s Stevie.Yeah.

19:23.466 --> 19:28.428
And I guess
she never has to know.

19:28.471 --> 19:31.431
It'’s kind of sad, right?
Yeah.

19:31.474 --> 19:32.823
You think
we should tell her?

19:32.867 --> 19:34.434
I'’d want to know

19:34.477 --> 19:36.349
if somebody cared
about me that much.I...

19:36.392 --> 19:37.654
I don'’t think we should

19:37.698 --> 19:40.657
rip the scab off
that old wound.Hmm.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.312
We'’d be throwing
a lot at her.

19:43.356 --> 19:47.142
Of course, our daughter
can handle a lot.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.187
You'’re leaning towards tell her.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.450
Well, call me a romantic.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.756
But you'’re the
Stevie whisperer...

19:52.800 --> 19:55.237
Mom, Dad! Have you guys
been watching this?

19:55.281 --> 19:56.847
The news is saying that

19:56.891 --> 19:59.241
Teresa Hurst'’s daughter used
a sex slave to carry her baby.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.982
There'’s still no word from
the vice president'’s office

20:01.025 --> 20:02.549
or from the White House
at this time.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.812
This is a still-developing
story...

20:04.855 --> 20:06.727
That'’s gonna hurt her
when she'’s gearing up for a run.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.859
[phones ringing]

20:08.903 --> 20:10.731
White House.Me too.

20:16.737 --> 20:19.218
Why didn'’t you tell me
you had a personal connection

20:19.261 --> 20:20.958
to the surrogate issue in Laos?

20:21.002 --> 20:23.265
I thought it best
to keep you out of it, sir.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.398
Well, guess what.
We'’re in it now.

20:25.441 --> 20:28.052
To hear cable news tell it,
we'’re running a baby mill

20:28.096 --> 20:29.445
out of the
Lincoln bedroom.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.186
I think we can all agree
that cable news

20:31.230 --> 20:32.796
tends to run toward
the hyperbolic.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.234
Well, that'’s why people
watch it, Professor.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.410
And you-- how could you
go along with this?

20:37.453 --> 20:40.108
I made a judgment call,
Mr. President.

20:40.151 --> 20:43.111
Teresa came to me
with a highly personal issue

20:43.154 --> 20:44.547
which intersected
with the professional.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.201
I skirted the edge,

20:46.245 --> 20:48.595
but I believe I acted
within my authority.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.118
The way
I see it,

20:50.161 --> 20:53.034
this mess has two components:
foreign and domestic.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.905
And the best way to manage
the domestic fallout

20:54.949 --> 20:57.560
is to get the Laos piece
of this in the rearview

20:57.604 --> 20:59.258
as soon as possible.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.433
DALTON:
You think this
international coalition

21:00.476 --> 21:01.695
is viable?

21:01.738 --> 21:03.479
I'’m still
making calls,

21:03.523 --> 21:06.134
but the U.K. and Israel
are interested,

21:06.177 --> 21:07.962
and our embassy in Laos
is prepared to care

21:08.005 --> 21:09.398
for all the surrogates

21:09.442 --> 21:12.358
if we can secure
their release.Sir,

21:12.401 --> 21:15.970
we'’re talking about
almost 300 surrogates.

21:16.013 --> 21:17.972
The safe bet
is to fight for the 36

21:18.015 --> 21:18.973
who are carrying babies

21:19.016 --> 21:20.322
for Americans.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.368
Frankly, Teresa,
I'’m not sure

21:22.411 --> 21:23.804
you can give an unbiased
opinion on this.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.240
I would make the same call

21:25.284 --> 21:28.374
even if I didn'’t have
a personal stake in this.

21:28.417 --> 21:31.812
American lives are on the line.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.944
They have to come first.

21:35.598 --> 21:38.253
Henry?

21:38.297 --> 21:41.952
Sir, I'’m not sure that
there'’s a right answer here.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.954
The coalition plan makes sense,

21:43.998 --> 21:47.349
in theory,

21:47.393 --> 21:50.352
but our backs
are against the wall here.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.920
Push comes to shove, I would go
with the vice president on this.

21:52.963 --> 21:56.358
What about the other countries
who have citizens

21:56.402 --> 21:58.969
with surrogates
locked up in Laos? I...

21:59.013 --> 22:00.754
Sorry, Bess.

22:00.797 --> 22:03.583
I'’m going with
Henry and Teresa.

22:03.626 --> 22:07.021
In that case, any wiggle room
with the aid package for Laos?

22:07.064 --> 22:09.066
Something that I can
negotiate with?

22:09.110 --> 22:10.764
They got a failing grade

22:10.807 --> 22:13.244
in the Trafficking
In Persons Report.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.508
We'’re cutting their aid.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.031
You'’ll have to
figure out

22:17.074 --> 22:19.076
how to get the surrogates
released without it.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.122
I'’ll do my best.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.124
Thank you,
everyone.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.647
Teresa, hang back
a minute.

22:24.691 --> 22:25.866
We need to talk.

22:34.396 --> 22:38.400
Listen, I'’m sorry.

22:38.444 --> 22:42.099
Don'’t be. We've been
on opposite sides before.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.187
Yeah, doesn'’t make it
any easier.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.928
I always want to be
on your side.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.321
But it'’s not like we're arguing

22:46.365 --> 22:49.498
about what percent fat
milk to buy.

22:49.542 --> 22:52.936
Lives are at stake. I'’ve got to
offer POTUS my best judgment.

22:52.980 --> 22:57.463
Different opinions means more
options to save those lives.

22:57.506 --> 23:00.117
And always two percent--
less fat, same protein.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.163
Admit it,
it'’s watery.

23:02.206 --> 23:05.601
You know, I understand why
you all want to play it safe,

23:05.645 --> 23:07.734
especially poor Teresa,

23:07.777 --> 23:09.518
but the thing
that'’s bugging me is,

23:09.562 --> 23:11.433
if that leak
hadn'’t happened,

23:11.477 --> 23:16.960
I think that coalition
had a pretty decent shot.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.397
Did Teresa know

23:18.440 --> 23:20.529
about the coalition
plan before tonight?

23:20.573 --> 23:23.184
Yeah, I gave her
a heads-up earlier.

23:23.227 --> 23:25.578
She didn'’t like it
then, either.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.971
Huh.No.

23:28.015 --> 23:29.843
Oh, th-think
about it--

23:29.886 --> 23:32.846
the-the leak forced Dalton
to get involved,

23:32.889 --> 23:35.152
and with the American media
watching, of course

23:35.196 --> 23:37.503
he'’s gonna choose the
American-focused plan,

23:37.546 --> 23:39.200
which is what she wanted.

23:39.243 --> 23:43.030
No, Teresa can'’t be the leaker.
[scoffs]

23:43.073 --> 23:45.424
She'’s too much
of a political animal

23:45.467 --> 23:48.296
to sabotage
her own career.

23:48.339 --> 23:51.168
With family is involved,
people will surprise you.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.651
Well, I can'’t worry
about that now.

23:55.695 --> 23:58.001
I have to figure out how to get
those surrogates released

23:58.045 --> 24:00.961
with what meager cards I have.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.147
Good Lord.Hi!

24:13.190 --> 24:14.235
Is that yesterday'’s suit?

24:14.278 --> 24:16.280
Hmm? Yes.
I pulled an all-nighter

24:16.324 --> 24:17.673
working on
the Peace Garden issue.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.849
In a nutshell:
we still don'’t have the money.

24:19.893 --> 24:20.981
Wait, Blake, the
reopening'’s tomorrow.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.330
You think I don'’t know that?

24:22.373 --> 24:23.810
This isn'’t just
some garden party.

24:23.853 --> 24:25.289
It'’s a major public
diplomacy event

24:25.333 --> 24:26.856
with one of our
closest allies.I know that!

24:26.900 --> 24:28.945
Okay, take it easy.
What'’s the problem?

24:28.989 --> 24:30.686
The problem is that
no one owns the problem,

24:30.730 --> 24:31.905
the Peace Garden
problem.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.341
Yes, technically,
Park Service owns it,

24:33.384 --> 24:34.647
but it'’s not their problem

24:34.690 --> 24:36.910
if Japan is asking
for more than they can give.

24:36.953 --> 24:38.477
Keeping Japan happy
is State'’s problem,

24:38.520 --> 24:40.000
but it'’s not our problem
if Park Services

24:40.043 --> 24:41.392
is having
money problems.

24:41.436 --> 24:43.830
Also, if I torch our
relationship with a vital ally,

24:43.873 --> 24:46.223
then my quest to be anything
more than an assistant

24:46.267 --> 24:47.921
in this office is ruined
before it even begins,

24:47.964 --> 24:50.750
because somehow, I,
with no money and no power,

24:50.793 --> 24:52.099
now own this problem.

24:52.142 --> 24:54.362
I'’m God's lonely man.
That'’s the problem.

24:54.405 --> 24:55.711
Also, about five hours ago,

24:55.755 --> 24:57.539
a very nice man on
the cleaning crew gave me a pill

24:57.583 --> 24:59.106
to help me stay awake,
and now I'’m having hand tremors.

24:59.149 --> 25:00.542
I'’m probably fine, right?

25:00.586 --> 25:02.631
I'’m gonna get you a glass
of cold water, okay?

25:02.675 --> 25:03.980
We'’re gonna figure this out.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.373
Now what about
the private sector?

25:05.416 --> 25:07.375
Japan came to us so late
with the budget

25:07.418 --> 25:09.812
I'’ve only been able to scare up
a few minor commitments.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.118
Mm-hmm.Believe me, the irony

25:11.161 --> 25:13.207
is not lost on me that
we are desperate for money

25:13.250 --> 25:15.514
while exorbitant gifts
keep flowing in.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.950
Yeah, well, if only you
could sell that watch, right?

25:16.993 --> 25:18.778
That watch... that watch.

25:18.821 --> 25:20.693
You know, my life
has been cursed

25:20.736 --> 25:22.346
ever since that watch
came into it.

25:22.390 --> 25:25.306
It'’s like The Monkey'’s Paw.

25:25.349 --> 25:26.568
Or it'’s the answer
to everything.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.222
Okay.

25:28.265 --> 25:31.791
[laughs]What is...

25:31.834 --> 25:33.444
Oh, Matt,

25:33.488 --> 25:35.838
you'’re a genius. [grunts]
Thank you!

25:35.882 --> 25:39.407
Mm-hmm. Okay, well, remember,
do the deep breathing thing.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.235
It really helps, man.

25:41.278 --> 25:43.498
[engine rumbling]

25:43.542 --> 25:46.327
Mr. Usuki, we can'’t
give you a one-on-one

25:46.370 --> 25:48.547
with the secretary
for what is--

25:48.590 --> 25:50.940
let'’s face it--
a bribe.

25:50.984 --> 25:53.334
But if you become a donor
for the Peace Garden,

25:53.377 --> 25:55.336
I-I'’m sure she
would thank you

25:55.379 --> 25:57.860
personally for
your generosity.

26:01.342 --> 26:03.039
[engine shuts off]

26:03.083 --> 26:05.259
Donor?

26:05.302 --> 26:08.610
Uh, yes, your donation
would go towards

26:08.654 --> 26:10.525
the upkeep of the
garden for the next

26:10.569 --> 26:12.048
50 years or so.

26:12.092 --> 26:14.050
When I was a kid,
my Grandma Chiaki

26:14.094 --> 26:16.749
would take me to our
local Japanese garden.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.707
We'’d sit on this bench
by the koi pond

26:18.751 --> 26:19.665
and pretend we were rich.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.580
[chuckles]

26:21.623 --> 26:23.973
She was rad.BLAKE: Yeah.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.106
So... yeah.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.760
Okay. Rae,

26:27.803 --> 26:29.457
take care of it.Oh, great.
I'’ll send over

26:29.500 --> 26:31.024
the documents, and,
of course, your name

26:31.067 --> 26:32.721
will be listed among
the other contributors

26:32.765 --> 26:35.681
on a placard
outside the garden.

26:35.724 --> 26:36.595
Among?

26:36.638 --> 26:38.074
Eh, I don'’t like that word.

26:38.118 --> 26:40.686
My name is better off solo
and in multiple locations.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.949
Also, "placard"-- yuck.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.646
Like, what am I, a dentist?

26:44.690 --> 26:47.257
I'’m thinking
a pagoda could work.

26:47.301 --> 26:50.304
Um, Mr. Usuki, I'’m sorry, there
are no names inside the garden,

26:50.347 --> 26:52.523
and there'’s no room
for a pagoda.

26:52.567 --> 26:53.960
Blake, I'’m hearing
a lot of "no,"

26:54.003 --> 26:55.570
it'’s really bumming me out.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.138
Oh... [stammers] I certainly
wouldn'’t want to do that.

26:58.181 --> 27:00.575
Look, I didn'’t get here
to where I am today

27:00.619 --> 27:02.403
by plugging into
negative energy.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.666
Grandma Chiaki
used to say to me, "One day,

27:04.710 --> 27:08.452
you are going to run this town,
and your name is going to be

27:08.496 --> 27:09.715
everywhere."

27:09.758 --> 27:11.325
And you know what?
She was right.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.370
[laughs]

27:13.414 --> 27:17.331
Yeah, well, Grandma Chiaki
sounds rad, but, um,

27:17.374 --> 27:21.683
the fact is, your name can'’t be
everywhere in the garden.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.467
Then I can'’t be a donor.

27:23.511 --> 27:24.904
Rae.

27:24.947 --> 27:27.907
Take care of it.

27:27.950 --> 27:31.301
That garden is a symbol
of reconciliation

27:31.345 --> 27:34.043
in the aftermath of mankind'’s
most horrific bloodbath,

27:34.087 --> 27:35.784
and you have the audacity

27:35.828 --> 27:38.004
to want to use it
for self-promotion?

27:39.788 --> 27:41.311
You know, I'’m shocked
your ego even fits

27:41.355 --> 27:43.618
in this tiny, little car.
Shame on you.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.012
No one talks to me like that.

27:46.055 --> 27:47.622
Well, someone just did.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.364
And I better not see this
in my office again.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.279
Have a nice day.Wait.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.849
That took integrity.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.764
Grandma Chiaki
respected integrity.

28:00.374 --> 28:03.769
Stay there.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.119
I'’m gonna take a lap,
think this over.

28:15.432 --> 28:18.305
ELIZABETH:
Minister Phommapanya,

28:18.348 --> 28:20.568
the swift action your
government has taken

28:20.611 --> 28:22.135
to control
human trafficking

28:22.178 --> 28:24.224
within your borders
is commendable.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.095
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.054
Our eye is on Tier 1 status,

28:28.097 --> 28:30.056
and showing the world
we value all human life.

28:30.099 --> 28:32.058
I was hoping
you felt that way.

28:32.101 --> 28:35.235
Your recent crackdowns included
a number of pregnant women.

28:35.278 --> 28:38.107
Surrogates for hire.
Criminals.

28:38.151 --> 28:40.631
Yes, according to your
anti-trafficking laws,

28:40.675 --> 28:43.025
but only in very
rare circumstances

28:43.069 --> 28:45.811
could surrogacy be considered
human trafficking.

28:45.854 --> 28:48.422
Did you call to lecture me
on our legal system?

28:48.465 --> 28:49.771
Or to talk about

28:49.815 --> 28:52.513
the 36 American couples
who'’ve been exploiting

28:52.556 --> 28:55.603
our citizens, including
your vice president?

28:55.646 --> 28:58.780
Let'’s focus on
the latter, for now.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.782
If your country
releases the women--

29:00.826 --> 29:03.611
all of whom are technically
carrying American citizens--

29:03.654 --> 29:06.309
my government would be
very appreciative.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.485
Appreciative enough
to reinstate our aid package...

29:08.529 --> 29:10.139
in full?

29:11.706 --> 29:14.491
Well, your aid package
is not on the table.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.580
But I can offer
a statement of praise

29:16.624 --> 29:17.973
for your anti-trafficking
efforts.

29:18.017 --> 29:21.411
You criticize us
for human trafficking

29:21.455 --> 29:23.805
then chastise us
for how we handle it.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.676
We have strict
commercial surrogacy laws,

29:25.720 --> 29:27.504
and yet you want us
to go against them

29:27.548 --> 29:29.593
because it suits your interests.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.813
I realize how this looks,

29:31.857 --> 29:34.642
but my country has a great deal
of respect for your nation.

29:34.685 --> 29:37.558
Much of the aid
your country provides

29:37.601 --> 29:40.213
goes to de-mining operations
to remove the bombs

29:40.256 --> 29:42.302
that the U.S. left behind
decades ago.

29:42.345 --> 29:44.217
Bombs that still kill our people

29:44.260 --> 29:46.175
to this day,
many of them children.

29:46.219 --> 29:49.831
Minister Phommapanya...
Vong,

29:49.875 --> 29:52.138
I know that what we did
over a period of years

29:52.181 --> 29:54.183
will be felt by your people
for generations.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.750
It was devastating.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.231
The mess we
left behind...

29:58.274 --> 30:00.929
We do not have the moral
high ground here,

30:00.973 --> 30:04.019
but there must be a way that you
can help me help these people.

30:04.063 --> 30:07.414
I mean... perhaps
as a humanitarian gesture.

30:09.546 --> 30:12.941
I value our relationship
with the U.S.,

30:12.985 --> 30:14.943
but there are those
who think the ally

30:14.987 --> 30:17.685
we should be strengthening
our ties with is China.

30:17.728 --> 30:20.819
Now, if you'’ll excuse me.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.525
Morning. Hey, you better
get in on these

30:31.568 --> 30:33.309
ricotta blueberry
pancakes before

30:33.353 --> 30:35.181
those monsters wake up
and eat '’em all.What happened? Who died?

30:35.224 --> 30:37.444
What? N-No one.
Everything'’s fine.

30:37.487 --> 30:40.142
Just take a plate and
go sit down, would you?

30:40.186 --> 30:42.449
Dad, any time
something bad happens

30:42.492 --> 30:43.885
and you don'’t know
how to tell me,

30:43.929 --> 30:46.235
there'’s usually some kind
of breakfast involved.

30:46.279 --> 30:48.803
Busted.Ha!

30:48.847 --> 30:51.588
I knew it. Sorry. Go on.

30:51.632 --> 30:53.025
All right.

30:53.068 --> 30:55.810
This is a little bit
of a weird one,

30:55.854 --> 30:59.292
but, um, here goes.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.816
Your Russian
friend, he...

31:01.860 --> 31:03.470
Dmitri?

31:03.513 --> 31:05.689
...found out about the
White House bombings,

31:05.733 --> 31:08.040
and since he didn'’t have a way
to contact you directly,

31:08.083 --> 31:10.172
he found another way to make
sure you were all right.

31:10.216 --> 31:11.870
It almost cost
him his deal.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.526
Wow.

31:16.570 --> 31:17.919
I wasn'’t sure
if I should tell you.

31:17.963 --> 31:22.228
No.
I'’m glad that you did.

31:22.271 --> 31:24.099
I just really
wasn'’t expecting

31:24.143 --> 31:27.189
to hear his name.

31:27.233 --> 31:29.844
That'’s really sweet, you know?

31:29.888 --> 31:32.107
Well, I hope knowing
how much he cares about you

31:32.151 --> 31:34.893
helps more than it hurts.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.637
I, um, try not to,

31:40.681 --> 31:44.554
but I think about him a lot.

31:44.598 --> 31:46.426
And I'’m still very sorry

31:46.469 --> 31:48.341
for putting the family

31:48.384 --> 31:50.996
in this awkward situation
in the first place.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.258
Inadvertently.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.564
You had no idea
what you were getting into.

31:54.608 --> 31:55.696
He did.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.089
Look, I know

31:57.132 --> 32:00.788
that it seemed shady

32:00.831 --> 32:03.965
with the secret Potomac Lodge

32:04.009 --> 32:07.099
rendezvous, but we had
something real.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.667
Well, that'’s love.

32:10.711 --> 32:13.932
It'’s uncomfortable for everybody
who'’s not in it with you.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.373
When I spoke to him, he
basically said the same thing.

32:20.416 --> 32:23.637
You talked to him?Yeah.

32:23.680 --> 32:26.640
How is he?He'’s good.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.729
I know that'’s not
much of an update,

32:28.772 --> 32:32.167
but I was able to get approval
for him to write you a letter.

32:32.211 --> 32:34.430
Now, it doesn'’t
change anything.

32:34.474 --> 32:35.997
You still can'’t
see him ever again.

32:36.041 --> 32:40.088
Right. Of-of course.
Yeah. Absolutely.

32:40.132 --> 32:44.745
I haven'’t read this,
but an analyst has,

32:44.788 --> 32:46.399
to make sure there'’s no
compromising information.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.577
I'’ll burn after reading.

32:53.797 --> 32:56.844
I got to go get dressed and
go with Mom to the Peace Garden,

32:56.887 --> 32:59.020
but I'’ll stay home
if you want me to.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.370
No, I'’m okay. Thanks.

33:04.373 --> 33:06.593
Thank you for trusting me enough
to tell me this.

33:21.390 --> 33:24.132
I just heard from
Israel and the U.K.

33:24.176 --> 33:27.396
They'’re disappointed we're
giving up on the coalition?

33:27.440 --> 33:29.311
That'’s the nice way to say it.

33:29.355 --> 33:30.921
Well, I deserve it.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.880
How'’s it going
with Commerce and DoD?

33:32.923 --> 33:35.535
No potential inducements for
Laos yet, but we'’ll keep at it.

33:35.578 --> 33:40.148
Yeah. So while we'’re working
on our next moves,

33:40.192 --> 33:43.325
check that our embassy in Laos
is doing everything that it can

33:43.369 --> 33:45.458
to provide support to the NGOs

33:45.501 --> 33:46.937
working on behalf
of the surrogates, okay?

33:46.981 --> 33:48.330
I want to make sure

33:48.374 --> 33:51.072
that we are still
doing what we can for them.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.639
Yes, ma'’am.

33:52.682 --> 33:54.423
So...

33:54.467 --> 33:56.860
scale of one to ten--
how hard has it been

33:56.904 --> 33:59.254
not to say anything
to me about Teresa?

33:59.298 --> 34:03.389
After the story broke, you
totally could'’ve called me out.

34:03.432 --> 34:06.044
Not hard at all. I trust you.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.654
There'’s a "but" in there.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.134
I didn'’t give you the look.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.526
I could feel it.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.398
This is why I can'’t play poker.

34:12.441 --> 34:16.880
I trust you.But...

34:16.924 --> 34:20.232
I doubt I would'’ve
trusted Teresa Hurst.

34:20.275 --> 34:24.149
On the other hand, I admire
that you had the heart to.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.195
Thanks, Jay.

34:30.024 --> 34:35.203
This garden depends on all of us
for its cultivation,

34:35.247 --> 34:39.773
and it asks us to do the hard
work of planting together.

34:39.816 --> 34:43.342
Washington is honored
to be the first stop

34:43.385 --> 34:46.171
on this deeply meaningful
world tour.

34:46.214 --> 34:47.346

Mr. Usuki. Welcome.

34:54.309 --> 34:56.964
Um, I-I noticed you hadn'’t
signed the contracts yet.

34:57.007 --> 34:57.921
Just want to make sure
I'’m getting everything

34:57.965 --> 34:59.140
I was promised, bro.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.360
Oh, yes, actually,
it'’s right here. Um...

35:01.403 --> 35:03.579
I know, it'’s...

35:03.623 --> 35:05.625
smaller than we discussed.

35:07.931 --> 35:09.585
It'’s perfect.

HENRY:
This really is beautiful.

ELIZABETH:
Hard to believe
it'’s a by-product of war.

35:35.568 --> 35:39.049
Makes you think about
the power of apology.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.661
Japan was defeated,
then they went around the world

35:41.704 --> 35:44.054
building these gardens
to acknowledge what they'’d done.

35:44.098 --> 35:46.492
Today they'’re more powerful
than they were

35:46.535 --> 35:48.189
when they were
an actual empire.

35:48.233 --> 35:51.279
Humility makes space
for new possibilities.

35:51.323 --> 35:53.499
You should'’ve given the speech.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.240
Eh, professor mode.

35:55.283 --> 35:57.416
No, you'’re right.

35:57.459 --> 36:00.158
Did you know Laos, per capita,

36:00.201 --> 36:03.422
is the most heavily bombed
country in history?

36:03.465 --> 36:07.600
Over a ten-year period,
we dropped two million tons

36:07.643 --> 36:09.210
of ordnance on them.

36:09.254 --> 36:13.214
And our leftover
unexploded bombs

36:13.258 --> 36:15.303
have killed
50 of their citizens

36:15.347 --> 36:17.566
every year since then,

36:17.610 --> 36:19.220
and we'’ve never owned that.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.830
Could we?

36:20.874 --> 36:23.746
Probably not formally.

36:23.790 --> 36:26.445
But an apologetic
gesture, maybe?

36:26.488 --> 36:29.448
The American equivalent
of a peace garden.

36:29.491 --> 36:32.625
We'’d need the right gardener.

36:32.668 --> 36:35.367
Thank you for taking the time
to see me.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.674
Please, sit down.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.763
I know you were
behind the leak.

36:42.809 --> 36:45.768
You were willing
to risk a career

36:45.812 --> 36:47.727
you spent a lifetime building

36:47.770 --> 36:49.729
to save your unborn grandchild.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.861
Wouldn'’t you do the same?

36:55.517 --> 36:58.477
I thank God I'’ve never been put
in such a difficult position.

37:00.305 --> 37:03.699
Actually...
I think we'’re gonna need

37:03.743 --> 37:07.181
more of that clarity
and audacity

37:07.225 --> 37:09.401
to get your grandchild
home safely.

37:09.444 --> 37:10.663
Go on.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.363
If the vice president
of the United States--

37:15.407 --> 37:18.366
a concerned
and soon-to-be grandmother--

37:18.410 --> 37:19.889
were to lead a delegation

37:19.933 --> 37:22.675
of worried American families
to Laos,

37:22.718 --> 37:25.373
it would humanize this issue.

37:25.417 --> 37:26.809
Have you considered

37:26.853 --> 37:29.421
that putting public pressure
on Laos could backfire?

37:29.464 --> 37:32.902
I have. And that'’s why
there'’s a part two.

37:32.946 --> 37:36.732
Laos has been waiting
nearly 50 years

37:36.776 --> 37:40.562
for some acknowledgement
by the United States

37:40.606 --> 37:44.305
of the destruction that our
bombing campaign wreaked

37:44.349 --> 37:46.133
on their country
during the Vietnam War.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.527
And so I'’m the one

37:48.570 --> 37:51.225
who'’s going to apologize
for America?

37:51.269 --> 37:53.793
Apologizing
isn'’t weakness.

37:53.836 --> 37:56.230
It'’s weakness

37:56.274 --> 37:58.798
that leads to the need
to apologize.

37:58.841 --> 38:01.017
And who knows--

38:01.061 --> 38:02.584
it might get us something
in return.

38:02.628 --> 38:06.327
But what if it doesn'’t?

38:06.371 --> 38:09.069
Well, you are a gifted
politician, Teresa.

38:09.112 --> 38:12.333
And God knows, it'’s tough
to show vulnerability

38:12.377 --> 38:14.204

38:14.248 --> 38:16.816
But the way
through this

38:16.859 --> 38:20.950
is to be open with your humanity

38:20.994 --> 38:24.214
and clear
in your convictions.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.384
for your understanding
and cooperation

39:03.428 --> 39:05.995
with this sensitive issue.

39:06.039 --> 39:08.084
There will be much to discuss

39:08.128 --> 39:11.479
with the Lao government
in coming days.
