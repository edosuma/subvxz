10:24.150 --> 10:26.460
What were you doing with him?

10:26.520 --> 10:29.330
The Lord Commander
sent me to the Half hand for seasoning.

10:29.390 --> 10:30.870
Why?

10:31.460 --> 10:33.130
He wants me to lead one day.

I think what you
want most of all is to be a hero.

11:10.660 --> 11:13.910
I'll ask you one last time,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.670
why do you want to join us?

11:21.440 --> 11:24.890
We stopped at Craster's Keep
on the way north.

11:26.410 --> 11:27.860
I saw...

11:29.120 --> 11:30.620
You saw what?

11:32.790 --> 11:36.630
I saw Craster take his own baby
boy and leave it in the woods.

11:37.590 --> 11:39.630
I saw what took it.

11:43.530 --> 11:47.600
You're telling me you saw one of them?

11:50.370 --> 11:52.870
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

11:53.540 --> 11:56.110
Because when I told the Lord Commander,

11:56.210 --> 11:58.090
he already knew.

No, I don't think so.

They said you'd lost your nose,

14:54.650 --> 14:56.730
but it's not as gruesome as all that.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.300
The man who cut me lost more than his nose.

14:59.390 --> 15:01.600
I should hope so.

What do I want from him? He's my father.

15:45.270 --> 15:47.550
Do I need to want something?

I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any
father loves his child, his baby boy.

Yet he hasn't come to visit once...

16:21.910 --> 16:25.750
You told him I had my guards
beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.

You did have your
guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.990
I was nine, too.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.890
She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.

Why are you so nervous
about what I'm going to say to Father?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.210
Because you're a liar.

As much as I appreciate
a walk in the sunshine,

You're here to protect me.

Poor? Poor?

18:19.090 --> 18:20.830
Under my patronage you've become a knight,

18:20.930 --> 18:22.870
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

I'm sure you filled your pockets.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.840
And now my pockets are empty.

18:27.930 --> 18:30.180
You've given me a taste

And if you want me
protecting you, you'll need to pay more.

20:13.770 --> 20:17.380
I was a captain and a knight.

20:17.440 --> 20:20.390
Aye, ser, and sewing which king?

20:26.950 --> 20:28.490
The one true king of Westeros,

20:32.460 --> 20:34.560
Stannis Baralheon.

20:43.970 --> 20:45.680
I thought you were dead.

20:45.770 --> 20:48.250
Everyone thought you were dead.

20:52.680 --> 20:53.750
And your son?

21:00.420 --> 21:02.130
He may have swam ashore as you did.

21:02.420 --> 21:05.270
No, the wildfire look him. I saw it.

21:14.830 --> 21:17.680
I'm so sorry, my friend.

21:18.170 --> 21:22.310
L, too, have lost a son.
There is nothing worse in this world.

21:24.480 --> 21:27.820
But, Davos, you were a good father.

21:28.780 --> 21:31.790
If I was a good father, he'd still be here.

21:34.350 --> 21:35.990
Stannis lives?

21:36.060 --> 21:37.470
He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.

21:37.620 --> 21:39.000
Will you take me there?

21:39.830 --> 21:42.240
There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.

21:42.330 --> 21:43.830
This war is not over.

21:43.900 --> 21:48.070
Not for you, maybe.
But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.

21:48.170 --> 21:50.010
We're both sworn to King Stannis.

21:50.070 --> 21:52.380
I am sworn to no man.

21:52.470 --> 21:56.320
I promised you 30 ships
and you promised me riches and glory.

21:56.380 --> 21:57.820
I delivered the ships.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.050
Stannis never gives up. Never.

22:00.150 --> 22:01.250
Now he will regroup...

22:01.380 --> 22:02.550
He's a broken man.

22:02.650 --> 22:05.090
His fleet lies at the
bottom of Blackwater Bay.

22:05.180 --> 22:08.500
They say he sees no one,
not his generals, not even his wife.

22:08.890 --> 22:15.000
Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear,
telling him what she sees in the flames

22:16.400 --> 22:17.900
and burning men alive.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.200
What?

22:19.270 --> 22:22.940
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

22:23.040 --> 22:28.350
All those who spoke against her
she called servants of darkness.

22:30.510 --> 22:33.350
They say she sang to them as they burned.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.360
I'm a pirate.

22:39.850 --> 22:43.530
You're a smuggler. Servants of darkness.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.690
I'm thinking Dragonstone
is a good place for us to avoid.

22:47.090 --> 22:48.270
Take me back there, please.

22:48.530 --> 22:51.060
(SCOFFS) You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

22:51.130 --> 22:53.300
Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.540
You could try.

22:55.300 --> 22:57.800
If you fail, they will burn you.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.610
If you succeed, they'll burn you.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.810
And you've only just come back to life.

23:02.910 --> 23:05.120
(CHUCKLES) Stay alive
a little longer, my friend.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.890
You call me friend.
You drank with me on my wedding day.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.950
And you drank with me on four of mine,

23:10.080 --> 23:12.120
but I don't ask you for favors.

23:12.220 --> 23:16.390
I have to stop her. Please, do this for me.

23:19.890 --> 23:22.130
When you are dead,

23:22.230 --> 23:24.640
I will gather your bones in a little sack

23:24.730 --> 23:27.610
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

23:40.580 --> 23:43.820
We should set
the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.660
There won't be a siege.
The Mountain can't defend a ruin.

23:46.750 --> 23:50.100
The Mountain will defend
whatever Tywin Lannister tells him.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.530
The Lannisters
have been running from us since Oxcross.

23:52.630 --> 23:55.300
I'd love a fight. The
men would love a fight.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.830
I don't think we're going to get one.

24:08.810 --> 24:10.950
(BLOOD DRIPPING)

24:11.380 --> 24:13.450
(FLY BUZZING)

24:45.980 --> 24:50.320
RICKARD: Two hundred Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

24:50.820 --> 24:53.390
The debt will be repaid, my friend.

24:53.490 --> 24:56.330
For them and for your sons.

24:56.390 --> 24:58.490
Will it?

24:58.560 --> 25:03.230
They rot in the ground
while their killer runs free.

25:03.330 --> 25:06.070
The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.

25:06.170 --> 25:08.700
My best hunters are after him.

25:27.850 --> 25:29.530
ROBB: A Mallister?

25:29.690 --> 25:31.360
CATELYN: Ser Jeremy.

25:31.860 --> 25:34.060
My father's bannerman.

25:38.860 --> 25:40.370
(SIGHS)

25:54.650 --> 25:57.990
Find her a chamber that
will serve as a cell.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.240
TALISA: She's your mother.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.970
ROBB: She freed Jaime Lannister.

26:14.070 --> 26:16.010
The Lannisters robbed them of their sons

26:16.140 --> 26:18.140
and she robbed them of their justice.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.480
(COUGHING)

26:20.070 --> 26:21.140
QYBURN: Water.

26:23.510 --> 26:24.990
(WHISPERS) Water.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.580
This needs to be cleaned and closed.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.190
What's your name, friend?

26:34.250 --> 26:35.820
Qyburn.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.260
You're lucky to be alive.

26:40.590 --> 26:42.100
Lucky?

27:09.120 --> 27:10.960
The badge looks good on you.

27:13.130 --> 27:15.540
Almost as good as it looked on me.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.800
Are you enjoying your new position?

27:22.670 --> 27:24.050
Am I enjoying it?

27:24.140 --> 27:25.310
I was very happy as Hand of the King.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.580
(TYWIN CHUCKLES)

27:27.470 --> 27:30.510
Yes. I heard how happy you were.

27:30.740 --> 27:31.980
(BLOWS)

27:32.510 --> 27:35.050
You brought a whore into my bed.

27:35.810 --> 27:38.420
It wasn't your bed at the time.

27:40.490 --> 27:43.090
I sent you here to advise the king.

27:43.820 --> 27:47.270
I gave you real power and authority.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.570
You chose to spend your days

27:49.930 --> 27:51.880
as you always have,

27:52.000 --> 27:56.500
bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.

27:58.670 --> 28:01.380
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.720
What do you want, Tyrion?

28:03.780 --> 28:06.780
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

28:06.880 --> 28:09.690
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

28:10.780 --> 28:13.420
My beloved father who

28:13.520 --> 28:15.730
somehow forgot to visit his wounded son

28:15.850 --> 28:18.100
After he fell on the battlefield.

28:18.190 --> 28:21.540
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

28:21.590 --> 28:25.100
I organized the defense of this city

28:25.200 --> 28:28.040
while you held court in
the ruins of Harrenhal.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.580
I led the foray
when the enemies were at the gate

28:30.640 --> 28:35.640
while your grandson, the king,
quivered in fear behind the walls.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.750
I bled in the mud for our family.

28:40.210 --> 28:44.560
And as my reward, I was trundled
off to some dark little cell.

28:45.450 --> 28:47.400
But what do I want?

28:48.250 --> 28:50.790
A little bloody gratitude would be a start.

28:50.890 --> 28:54.000
Jugglers and singers require applause.

28:54.090 --> 28:56.570
You are a Lannister.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.640
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses

28:59.770 --> 29:02.140
every time I suffered a
wound on a battlefield?

29:02.230 --> 29:03.240
Hmm?

29:04.300 --> 29:06.980
Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after

29:07.110 --> 29:09.810
and three of them are in open rebellion.

29:10.580 --> 29:15.250
So tell me what you want.

29:19.180 --> 29:21.930
I want what is mine by right.

29:23.660 --> 29:27.260
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

29:27.330 --> 29:31.430
But he is a Kingsguard,
forbidden from marriage or inheritance.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.770
The day Jaime put on the white cloak,

29:33.870 --> 29:36.140
he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.

29:37.440 --> 29:40.470
I am your son and lawful heir.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.880
You want Casterly Rock?

29:44.980 --> 29:46.890
It is mine by right.

29:48.810 --> 29:50.490
(SIGHS)

29:51.650 --> 29:55.150
We'll find you accommodations
more suited to your name

29:55.790 --> 29:58.500
and as a reward for your accomplishments

29:58.620 --> 30:01.330
during the battle of Blackwater Bay.

30:02.290 --> 30:06.500
And when the time is right, you will be
given a position fit for your talents

30:06.570 --> 30:10.410
so that you can
serve your family and protect our legacy.

30:11.370 --> 30:15.250
And if you serve faithfully,
you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.

30:16.380 --> 30:18.750
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

30:18.840 --> 30:23.420
before mocking the family
name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.

30:25.150 --> 30:27.720
Why?

30:27.820 --> 30:30.030
You ask that?

30:30.090 --> 30:33.230
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

30:33.330 --> 30:37.500
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

30:37.560 --> 30:40.570
full of envy, lust, and low cunning.

30:41.830 --> 30:45.610
Men's laws give you the right to bear my
name and display my colors

30:45.700 --> 30:48.690
since I cannot prove that you are not mine.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.790
And to teach me humility,
the Gods have condemned me

30:52.880 --> 30:56.350
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

30:56.420 --> 31:00.190
that was my fathers sigil
and his fathers before him.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.100
But neither Gods nor men

31:02.190 --> 31:05.070
will ever compel me to
let you turn Casterly Rock

31:05.120 --> 31:06.930
into your whorehouse.

31:08.530 --> 31:10.730
Go, now.

31:14.070 --> 31:17.710
Speak no more of
your rights to Casterly Rock.

31:19.940 --> 31:21.320
Go.

31:30.820 --> 31:31.890
One more thing.

31:35.550 --> 31:38.900
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.480
SANSA: Dorne. It's going to Dorne.

31:49.570 --> 31:50.840
SHAE: Why Dome?

31:50.970 --> 31:52.280
It's carrying silk

31:52.340 --> 31:55.840
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.320
But it's not coming back.

32:02.410 --> 32:04.790
The captain's tired of risking his life

32:04.850 --> 32:06.960
so King's Landing lords and ladies

32:07.020 --> 32:10.260
can get drunk
on better wine than they deserve.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.630
He's going to stay in Dorne.

32:13.690 --> 32:17.160
Wait out the winter
where it's beautiful and warm.

32:17.260 --> 32:20.870
I met some people in Dome
who weren't so beautiful and warm.

32:20.970 --> 32:23.310
Don't ruin the game.

32:23.370 --> 32:25.970
I told you, I don't want to play.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.850
What about that one there?

32:28.940 --> 32:32.350
SHAE: That one? It's going to Volantis.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.620
Why?

32:33.710 --> 32:38.290
Because when I got on a ship in
Volantis, it looked like that one.

32:38.350 --> 32:39.850
That's not how the game works.

32:39.950 --> 32:43.530
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

32:43.620 --> 32:47.500
You've got to invent a story about
where the ship is going and why.

32:48.790 --> 32:51.670
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

32:52.630 --> 32:56.200
Because the truth
is always either terrible or boring.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.970
Lovely day for it.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.980
Watching the ships.

33:01.210 --> 33:02.690
Lord Baelish.

33:04.640 --> 33:08.560
Might I speak
with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?

33:20.390 --> 33:23.070
I saw your mother not long ago.

33:24.660 --> 33:26.770
She's very eager to see you.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.380
And your sister.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.110
Aryans alive?

33:38.010 --> 33:39.580
You said you'd take me home.

33:40.180 --> 33:43.350
You said King's Landing was your home.

33:44.450 --> 33:47.090
You are the property of the crown.
Stealing you would be treason.

33:47.190 --> 33:48.760
If you were to tell just one person...

33:48.850 --> 33:49.960
I won't tell anyone.

33:50.090 --> 33:51.230
How do I know?

33:51.290 --> 33:53.270
Because I'm a terrible liar.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.630
You said so yourself.

33:56.190 --> 33:59.700
Please, Lord Baelish.
Tell me what to do. Tell me when.

34:02.370 --> 34:07.210
I'm waiting for word on an assignment that
will take me far away from the capital.

34:07.270 --> 34:11.719
When I set sail,
I might be able to take you with me.

34:11.780 --> 34:14.989
But you'll need to
be ready to leave on a moment's notice.

34:17.050 --> 34:19.219
You're her handmaiden?

34:21.449 --> 34:24.260
Yes. And you're his...

34:24.320 --> 34:26.389
I help manage his affairs.

34:27.730 --> 34:28.929
He's an important person.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.340
So is she.

34:31.060 --> 34:33.840
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

34:33.929 --> 34:38.239
The day she was born, they rang the
bells from sunrise till sunset.

34:40.440 --> 34:43.179
We've both done rather well, you and I.

34:45.739 --> 34:47.489
Yes.

34:47.580 --> 34:49.460
Given where we started.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.420
And where is that?

34:54.489 --> 34:58.590
It's not easy
for girls like us to dig our way out.

35:03.500 --> 35:06.100
Watch out for her.

35:06.370 --> 35:08.140
I always do.

35:09.370 --> 35:11.540
Watch out for her with him.

I can! wait that long.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.000
I need an army.

We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.

Some say the Unsullied
are the greatest soldiers in the world.

36:27.510 --> 36:29.790
The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.090
The distinction
means a good deal to some people.

36:32.180 --> 36:34.600
Do those people have any better ideas

36:34.720 --> 36:37.200
about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
