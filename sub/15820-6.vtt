L. A. P. D

00:28.458 --> 00:31.916
L. A. P. D I'm looking for
congresswoman Simmons, please.

00:31.956 --> 00:35.124
And can you tell me what
table she's at, please?

00:35.355 --> 00:38.018
Thank you.

00:39.154 --> 00:41.453
A former district attorney,

00:41.553 --> 00:43.452
the highest-ranking woman

00:43.852 --> 00:45.812
on the house judiciary committee.

00:45.852 --> 00:48.756
And I can tell you from
personal experience,

00:48.851 --> 00:52.950
the maker of one mean margarita…

00:54.850 --> 00:57.849
She has devoted her entire career

00:58.048 --> 01:00.648
to seeing to it that the prerogatives

01:00.848 --> 01:03.752
envisioned by those
who founded this country

01:03.847 --> 01:06.046
are enforced by our legal system,

01:06.346 --> 01:08.245
that the promise of life,

01:08.445 --> 01:09.145
liberty,

01:09.345 --> 01:10.904
and the pursuit of happiness

01:10.944 --> 01:12.990
is passed on to each individual

01:13.143 --> 01:14.943
and to each generation.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.702
Ladies and gentlemen…

01:16.742 --> 01:18.302
Excuse me, congresswoman Simmons…

01:18.342 --> 01:19.401
Oh, thank you for coming.

01:19.441 --> 01:21.101
Can I find you after the reception?

01:21.141 --> 01:22.600
Uh, Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson,

01:22.640 --> 01:23.400
Priority Homicide.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.399
Madam, I need to talk to you
as soon as possible, please.

01:25.439 --> 01:26.699
Is this about Homeland Security?

01:26.739 --> 01:27.298
No, madam.

01:27.338 --> 01:28.988
It's about your daughter.

01:30.237 --> 01:31.237
5 Minutes, ok?

01:45.933 --> 01:46.433
Chief?

01:48.732 --> 01:50.092
So this is about my daughter?

01:50.132 --> 01:51.056
What happened?

01:51.231 --> 01:55.090
Congresswoman Simmons, is there
somewhere I can talk to you by yourself?

01:55.130 --> 01:56.648
I prefer Larry to stay.

01:57.029 --> 01:57.953
All right, um…

02:01.728 --> 02:03.180
Is this your daughter?

02:03.227 --> 02:04.127
Yes, why?

02:04.327 --> 02:05.686
Oh, now you're scaring
me. What happened?

02:05.726 --> 02:07.486
–What's happened?
–I'm sorry to inform you

02:07.526 --> 02:11.750
that your daughter was found
murdered in her house this morning.

02:11.824 --> 02:13.342
You're sure it was her?

02:13.724 --> 02:15.423
–Yes.
–What?

02:15.623 --> 02:17.782
At the moment, it looks like
she died from a blow to the head,

02:17.822 --> 02:18.422
But, uh,

02:18.822 --> 02:20.881
There are indications she
may have been raped as well.

02:20.921 --> 02:21.521
Ohh…

02:24.820 --> 02:26.079
Wait a minute. Are you sure?

02:26.119 --> 02:28.165
Do you have crime scene photos?

02:28.520 --> 02:30.179
Madam, I don't think
you want to see this.

02:30.219 --> 02:31.803
I have to know for sure!

02:35.417 --> 02:36.317
Oh, dear god.

02:37.516 --> 02:38.116
Ohh…

02:39.616 --> 02:41.375
I will take care of the reception

02:41.415 --> 02:44.714
And I'll have your car
brought around back.

02:46.413 --> 02:47.337
Who found her?

02:47.713 --> 02:50.072
When she didn't show up for work
this morning and didn't phone in,

02:50.112 --> 02:51.972
Her boss got ahold of
the guy she rents from,

02:52.012 --> 02:53.911
And, um… Yeah.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.470
Have you made an arrest?

02:57.510 --> 02:59.069
Was your daughter dating anyone?

02:59.109 --> 02:59.901
A boyfriend?

03:00.409 --> 03:01.708
No. No one serious.

03:02.408 --> 03:03.767
Do you have any leads?

03:03.807 --> 03:05.867
Had she mentioned anyone
threatening her lately?

03:05.907 --> 03:07.166
–Did she say anything?
–Now, look,

03:07.206 --> 03:08.866
I know you're trained not
to answer my questions,

03:08.906 --> 03:11.065
But I'm not just a
mother, I'm a former DA.

03:11.105 --> 03:12.557
Do you have any leads?

03:13.604 --> 03:17.364
I'm sorry to try and talk to you
at such a terrible moment, madam.

03:17.404 --> 03:18.364
We'll talk later.

03:18.404 --> 03:19.724
No, no, please wait.

03:21.402 --> 03:25.301
Carla is not the kind of
girl that people want to hurt.

03:25.401 --> 03:28.100
She… she doesn't have stalkers.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.016
Oh, god, this is terrible!

03:37.997 --> 03:39.779
Gabriel, Priority Homicide.

04:06.888 --> 04:08.547
There were no signs of forced entry,

04:08.587 --> 04:10.547
so maybe he was someone Carla knew.

04:10.587 --> 04:11.986
Hmm, or just met.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.846
Lieutenant Tao, how did this go?

04:13.886 --> 04:15.338
Judging from the blood

04:15.685 --> 04:17.444
and general disturbance in the room,

04:17.483 --> 04:19.067
the attack started here…

04:20.583 --> 04:21.837
ended up over here,

04:21.882 --> 04:24.882
and we think we found some prints

04:24.982 --> 04:27.341
that definitely belong to the attacker.

04:27.381 --> 04:28.940
And I've talked to
some of Carla's friends.

04:28.980 --> 04:31.140
She'd been seeing someone
the last few months.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.239
–Broke it off 2 weeks ago.
–Name?

04:33.279 --> 04:35.438
She hadn't introduced him to anyone.

04:35.478 --> 04:39.636
If you could get a name to go
with that boyfriend, I'd like it.

04:39.677 --> 04:42.185
Her mom says she wasn't dating anyone.

04:42.676 --> 04:45.435
Has your mother met everyone who's
spent the night at your house?

04:45.475 --> 04:46.474
I hope not.

05:11.967 --> 05:14.937
Brett Harland, mid-level
marketing executive.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.725
Carla shared an account
with his company,

05:16.765 --> 05:18.524
so they worked together some, I think.

05:18.564 --> 05:20.824
That explains why she kept
it quiet. What does he have?

05:20.864 --> 05:21.423
No record.

05:21.463 --> 05:23.823
A communications degree
is as bad as it gets.

05:23.863 --> 05:25.722
Does he know why we asked
him to come down here?

05:25.762 --> 05:29.021
No, I just called him at work,
told him we need to speak with him.

05:29.061 --> 05:31.520
Where's the fingerprint
report on this guy?

05:31.560 --> 05:32.520
This is taking too long.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.419
Lieutenant Tao is working on the
stuff from the shoeboxes right now

05:35.459 --> 05:38.018
trying to see if it
matches up to our attacker.

05:38.058 --> 05:38.758
Chief?

05:38.957 --> 05:40.805
Why do you need an earpiece?

05:40.857 --> 05:41.856
He's not a pro.

05:42.756 --> 05:44.472
I don't want to scare him,

05:44.557 --> 05:48.055
so I am trying to look
like your assistant.

05:48.855 --> 05:49.845
How am I doing?

05:50.455 --> 05:51.907
Get me another coffee.

05:52.854 --> 05:53.653
Nice try.

05:54.353 --> 05:55.913
You stay here and listen,

05:55.953 --> 05:57.712
and if I say follow up
on something in there,

05:57.752 --> 05:59.411
that means I want you to follow up,

05:59.451 --> 06:02.710
and if that fingerprint
report comes in while I'm gone,

06:02.750 --> 06:04.334
I want to hear about it.

06:05.249 --> 06:06.249
Yes, madam.

06:10.448 --> 06:11.747
–Sorry.
–Hi.

06:11.847 --> 06:12.547
Hi.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.405
Do I need a lawyer?

06:19.445 --> 06:20.544
No, no.

06:21.844 --> 06:23.503
Oh, I'm not supposed to say that.

06:23.543 --> 06:25.589
Oh, I'm not supposed to say no.

06:25.643 --> 06:26.633
Hi, I'm Brenda.

06:26.942 --> 06:28.542
Hi, I'm, Brett.

06:28.941 --> 06:30.501
–Nice to meet you.
–You, too.

06:30.541 --> 06:32.701
Well, you could get a
lawyer if you wanted to,

06:32.741 --> 06:36.100
But I don't think you need one for
the stuff that they want me to ask you.

06:36.140 --> 06:39.339
So I'm not, like, in
trouble or something?

06:39.439 --> 06:40.759
Oh, nobody told you?

06:40.938 --> 06:43.597
No, and I've been waiting
here a long time now.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.337
Oh, no.

06:45.837 --> 06:47.289
They were supposed to…

06:47.636 --> 06:50.295
The people who called you
were supposed to explain…

06:50.335 --> 06:52.534
Um… Ohh no, um,

06:53.334 --> 06:54.456
those detectives!

06:55.533 --> 06:57.051
See, there's this list,

06:57.233 --> 07:00.432
um, that we have of about 100 guys

07:00.632 --> 07:03.668
who we're supposed to
check out for this rape.

07:04.930 --> 07:05.630
A rape?

07:06.829 --> 07:09.588
What put me on this list? I mean,
what do I have to do with anything?

07:09.628 --> 07:10.588
Probably nothing.

07:10.628 --> 07:13.387
I was actually told that
we're eliminating suspects.

07:13.427 --> 07:14.987
What rape? Who was raped?

07:15.027 --> 07:17.186
We're not allowed to
identify rape victims.

07:17.226 --> 07:19.074
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

07:19.225 --> 07:23.185
Um, look, um, we'll go through
these questions really fast, ok?

07:23.225 --> 07:26.261
I don't mean to hurry
you, but I am so behind.

07:27.523 --> 07:28.383
Then what questions?

07:28.423 --> 07:29.223
Very easy.

07:29.423 --> 07:33.521
Where were you between 9 P. M And 12:00?

07:34.921 --> 07:37.720
At a bar with a friend
of mine, uh, Brad.

07:37.820 --> 07:38.420
Ok.

07:38.819 --> 07:40.931
I just need to get Brad's number

07:41.419 --> 07:43.333
in case we need to follow up.

07:44.418 --> 07:45.317
323…

07:45.817 --> 07:49.216
323…

07:49.516 --> 07:50.416
555…

07:51.015 --> 07:52.115
555…

07:52.515 --> 07:55.514
–0167…
–Great.

07:56.014 --> 07:57.070
That's his cell.

07:58.213 --> 07:59.512
Thank you, Buzz.

08:00.312 --> 08:02.012
Let's see, what else…

08:02.112 --> 08:04.158
Oh! We have to swab your cheek.

08:06.010 --> 08:06.910
Ohh, god…

08:09.109 --> 08:10.510
Ohh, shoot!

08:11.409 --> 08:13.309
Oh! Here it is.

08:13.509 --> 08:16.108
Look, why am I on this list?

08:16.508 --> 08:17.696
You want to check?

08:17.807 --> 08:21.406
Yeah. I… I mean, yeah.

08:21.606 --> 08:23.105
–Ok.
–Please.

08:28.304 --> 08:28.803
Oh.

08:29.103 --> 08:29.703
What?

08:30.203 --> 08:32.402
–Oh, um…
–Wh.. wh.. what is it?

08:33.702 --> 08:38.000
Some of your stuff was
found at the victim's house:

08:38.200 --> 08:39.388
an electric razor,

08:39.400 --> 08:41.499
a baseball cap…

08:41.698 --> 08:42.999
Oh, my god. Carla…

08:43.198 --> 08:44.898
–Oh, sir…
–…was raped?

08:44.998 --> 08:47.297
Oh, we're not supposed to… oh, no.

08:47.397 --> 08:48.197
Oh, my god.

08:48.297 --> 08:49.856
–Please, you're not supposed to know that.
–Oh, my god.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.396
Is she all right?

08:51.896 --> 08:52.395
Um…

08:52.495 --> 08:54.155
Look, Carla and I dated for 6 months.

08:54.195 --> 08:57.953
We only just broke up. I think I have
a right to know what's going on here.

08:57.993 --> 08:58.693
I can't.

09:00.194 --> 09:02.353
Did she say that I have
something to do with this?

09:02.393 --> 09:03.792
Oh, no, sir,

09:03.892 --> 09:05.952
no one is accusing you of anything.

09:05.992 --> 09:07.751
It's just that they found your stuff

09:07.791 --> 09:09.550
At the young lady's house, so…

09:09.590 --> 09:11.650
Well, that's because
she was holding onto it

09:11.690 --> 09:13.989
until I… I gave her her key back,

09:14.489 --> 09:15.289
that's all.

09:16.388 --> 09:19.028
Our schedules just
haven't been able to…

09:19.087 --> 09:19.887
Oh, my god.

09:21.886 --> 09:24.086
Is she all right?

09:24.785 --> 09:25.785
I can't…

09:29.684 --> 09:31.883
You know, I… I warned her…

09:33.282 --> 09:38.681
When we broke up, I told her that if
she wanted to do this weird stuff…

09:39.480 --> 09:40.280
Weird stuff?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.139
Oh, maybe I should write that down.

09:43.179 --> 09:44.638
No, no, no, no, it's ok.

09:44.678 --> 09:45.866
It's just routine.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.637
Thank you for the confirmation, Brad.

09:47.677 --> 09:49.438
The fingerprints on this guy's razor

09:49.478 --> 09:51.656
don't match up with the killer's.

09:52.277 --> 09:53.077
Damn it.

09:53.277 --> 09:55.736
I've heard a lot of
weird things around here.

09:55.776 --> 09:56.735
You can tell me.

09:56.775 --> 09:58.623
I have probably heard worse.

10:00.530 --> 10:01.314
Chief?

10:01.379 --> 10:03.953
Brett's prints do not match the rapist.

10:04.384 --> 10:08.074
It's just, you know, drugs.

10:08.624 --> 10:10.264
Drugs.

10:11.371 --> 10:13.813
And, role-playing.

10:15.869 --> 10:18.113
She wanted to experiment sexually.

10:23.871 --> 10:26.799
Look, I think I should call her
to see if she's ok, you know?

10:26.839 --> 10:28.357
She might need me or something.

10:28.397 --> 10:30.532
So is there anything else
that you want from me?

10:30.572 --> 10:32.750
I… I need you to lift your shirt.

10:33.056 --> 10:35.960
We've got some blood
that we can't identify.

10:39.268 --> 10:41.649
Blood? Whose blood?

10:41.960 --> 10:42.757
At the crime scene.

10:42.797 --> 10:46.079
Please, sir, if you could just
lift up your shirt real quick,

10:46.119 --> 10:48.434
It'll just be a second.

11:13.399 --> 11:15.110
Whose blood?

11:17.828 --> 11:18.752
Carla's blood?

11:24.975 --> 11:30.110
Uh, sir, I am genuinely
sorry to tell you that, uh…

11:31.419 --> 11:32.285
during the attack,

11:32.325 --> 11:34.137
Carla Simmons was…

11:34.237 --> 11:34.942
She died?

11:38.264 --> 11:39.518
Someone killed her?

11:50.947 --> 11:51.937
I'm sorry, sir.

11:53.364 --> 11:54.068
Uh, chief,

11:54.572 --> 11:56.024
Pope wants to see you.

11:59.203 --> 12:00.673
My strongest lead is a dead end.

12:00.713 --> 12:02.283
You cannot release my crime scene.

12:02.323 --> 12:04.196
S. I. D Has already been
through everything twice.

12:04.236 --> 12:05.202
It's all memorialized.

12:05.242 --> 12:07.316
You have the dresser and her computer.

12:07.356 --> 12:09.531
Carla's mother wants the rest
of her daughter's things, ok?

12:09.571 --> 12:11.242
She's an emotional wreck right now

12:11.282 --> 12:14.263
–And she's really…
–And she's trying to assert herself into this investigation.

12:14.303 --> 12:16.276
Congresswoman Simmons was one of us.

12:16.316 --> 12:19.699
Would it kill you to make a friend
out of her instead of an enemy?

12:19.739 --> 12:20.907
Look, you have until tomorrow morning.

12:20.947 --> 12:22.719
Send one of your guys over
there and have them get…

12:22.759 --> 12:24.430
We're in the middle of interviews!

12:24.470 --> 12:26.041
Her friends, her co-workers, we're…

12:26.081 --> 12:27.652
I don't know how else to say it.

12:27.692 --> 12:29.464
If you want something from the house,

12:29.504 --> 12:30.208
go get it.

12:34.437 --> 12:35.805
I could stay, if you want.

12:35.845 --> 12:37.215
No, that's not necessary.

12:37.255 --> 12:37.959
Thank you.

12:38.060 --> 12:39.369
Well, actually,

12:39.973 --> 12:42.087
her key is the only one we got

12:42.188 --> 12:44.966
–And it has “do not duplicate”
stamped on it… –Uh-huh.

12:45.006 --> 12:46.788
and I'm responsible for it.

12:46.918 --> 12:47.422
Uh-huh.

12:48.227 --> 12:53.019
I'll keep it and just leave the front
door open for you while you're here.

12:53.059 --> 12:55.576
Ok. Have a good dinner.

12:55.878 --> 12:56.604
Good night.

14:57.631 --> 14:58.334
Feel that…

14:58.635 --> 14:59.427
In your gut?

15:00.742 --> 15:01.304
Is it loaded?

15:01.344 --> 15:03.720
Get off me or you're gonna find out!

15:06.561 --> 15:07.815
Take your mask off.

15:08.568 --> 15:10.086
Take your mask off now!

15:10.775 --> 15:12.482
–Do it!
–Ok, ok, please!

15:12.783 --> 15:14.301
Please, don't shoot me.

15:14.488 --> 15:16.455
You're under arrest for
breaking and entering,

15:16.495 --> 15:17.860
assaulting a police officer…

15:17.900 --> 15:18.462
Wait, wait, wait!

15:18.502 --> 15:19.867
–Attempted rape…
–This is entrapment!

15:19.907 --> 15:21.673
If you so much as move
your little finger,

15:21.713 --> 15:23.627
I'm gonna blow your head off!

16:42.962 --> 16:43.466
Fritz?

16:45.784 --> 16:46.972
Did I wake you up?

16:47.599 --> 16:49.711
Oh, no, I shouldn't have called.

16:50.220 --> 16:53.304
Oh, no, no, no. It's fine,
really. Go back to sleep.

16:53.344 --> 16:55.663
No, no, no. It's no big deal.

16:55.764 --> 16:56.424
It's just…

16:58.183 --> 17:00.097
just kind of a rough evening…

17:02.214 --> 17:05.299
And I just, you know, I just
thought if you were up and all…

17:05.339 --> 17:05.844
Yeah?

17:06.648 --> 17:07.455
Uh, we, uh,

17:07.557 --> 17:08.679
Processed the guy

17:08.766 --> 17:09.736
And he's in the interview room,

17:09.776 --> 17:12.557
And the congresswoman's in Pope's
office waiting to hear what we got.

17:12.597 --> 17:14.008
Ok, ok.

17:15.521 --> 17:16.973
No, no, you know what?

17:17.031 --> 17:19.144
I'm gonna go watch an interview.

17:20.157 --> 17:21.829
No, no, no, no, it's fine, really.

17:21.869 --> 17:23.256
Um, go back to sleep.

17:23.887 --> 17:24.894
No, really, no.

17:25.801 --> 17:27.615
Good night. Ok. Good night.

17:28.523 --> 17:29.189
Are you ok?

17:29.229 --> 17:30.483
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

17:30.540 --> 17:31.596
Uh, where is he?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.305
Uh, interview room.

17:37.091 --> 17:37.857
Sure you want me to do this?

17:37.897 --> 17:40.579
Yes, yes, I don't think
I could be objective.

17:40.619 --> 17:42.929
You'll do fine, sergeant, I'm sure.

17:43.239 --> 17:44.509
Volume here, up and down…

17:44.549 --> 17:45.935
Camera 2, on and off.

17:45.961 --> 17:47.534
I'll be right outside if you need me.

17:47.574 --> 17:48.828
Thank you, Winston.

17:49.691 --> 17:51.363
You didn't have to clear the room, Will.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.117
Well, I feel differently.

17:55.436 --> 17:56.690
–Are you ok?
–Yeah.

17:56.747 --> 17:58.621
Here, sit down, for god's sake.

17:58.661 --> 17:59.932
Why don't you just go home?

17:59.972 --> 18:01.345
Honestly, Will, I'd rather stand.

18:01.385 --> 18:02.150
Please, don't…

18:02.190 --> 18:04.509
don't… don't make such a fuss, ok?

18:04.609 --> 18:07.315
Uh, it's not like I
got shot or anything.

18:12.572 --> 18:15.696
Andrew Lyle Gage.

18:16.301 --> 18:19.073
You're under arrest
for the attempted rape

18:19.627 --> 18:21.739
and battery of a police officer.

18:21.845 --> 18:24.224
–Anything you say can and will be used against you…
–Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:24.264 --> 18:25.132
No miranda, please!

18:25.172 --> 18:27.550
–You have the right to an attorney…
–This is the hugest mistake.

18:27.590 --> 18:29.969
–If you cannot afford an attorney…
–I don't need an attorney.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.482
I'm not the one breaking the law here.

18:31.522 --> 18:35.944
–Do you understand your rights, Mr Gage?
–I don't need an attorney!

18:37.114 --> 18:37.927
I'm married.

18:38.131 --> 18:39.208
No one can know about this.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.304
I have children.

18:41.483 --> 18:42.341
I understand.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.474
How old are your kids, huh?

18:43.514 --> 18:47.672
Think they're up for hearing how
daddy plays when mommy's away?

18:49.102 --> 18:51.235
Look, everything here is legal,

18:52.048 --> 18:53.532
ok, for consensual adults.

18:53.572 --> 18:56.680
So your wife consents to
you raping other women, huh?

18:56.720 --> 18:58.172
Wow, that's a new one.

18:58.346 --> 18:59.119
That's a new one.

18:59.159 --> 19:01.205
That's pretty tough stuff, man.

19:01.293 --> 19:02.471
You play hard, huh?

19:02.511 --> 19:05.011
I brought what I thought she would like.

19:05.051 --> 19:05.777
Look at me.

19:06.574 --> 19:08.057
She was the tough one, ok?

19:08.097 --> 19:08.871
And tell me this,

19:08.911 --> 19:10.293
if you ask to be raped…

19:10.333 --> 19:13.239
–I could summarize this for you in one sentence.
–No, no, no, no.

19:13.279 --> 19:14.254
I want to see his face.

19:14.294 --> 19:15.576
What, by leaving the door open?

19:15.616 --> 19:17.200
And the girl from the other night,

19:17.240 --> 19:18.420
she was asking for it, too!

19:18.460 --> 19:20.191
–What girl last night?
–The other girl at the same house!

19:20.231 --> 19:21.485
Don't play with me!

19:22.626 --> 19:24.023
I don't know anything

19:24.123 --> 19:25.707
about anyone last night,

19:25.720 --> 19:28.773
and when I say the woman who did
this to my face was asking for it,

19:28.813 --> 19:30.970
I mean, she was really asking for it.

19:31.010 --> 19:31.668
Asking how?

19:31.708 --> 19:32.607
Online.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.764
Look in my bag. You'll see it.

19:34.804 --> 19:36.760
She had a personal on the Jones list,

19:36.800 --> 19:38.796
under women seeking men S&M

19:38.996 --> 19:40.054
It has directions,

19:40.094 --> 19:40.652
her address book!

19:40.692 --> 19:43.002
She wanted me to do it! Look at it.

19:44.385 --> 19:46.761
I was responding to her, that's all.

19:48.277 --> 19:50.389
She was literally asking for it.

19:53.569 --> 19:54.926
Ok, all right, stop the interview.

19:54.966 --> 19:55.965
Will, please,

19:56.063 --> 19:59.715
tell sergeant Gabriel to
stop the interview, Will.

20:09.977 --> 20:12.089
Miss Johnson, are you all right?

20:12.204 --> 20:14.087
Better things have happened to me.

20:14.127 --> 20:18.138
Congresswoman Simmons, I just want to say
I know that what happened to you is awful,

20:18.178 --> 20:21.276
but I really think that you should
let us finish our investigation

20:21.316 --> 20:23.199
before asking for this progress report.

20:23.239 --> 20:26.278
–Do you have children?
–No.

20:26.581 --> 20:28.825
Then I won't even try and explain.

20:30.124 --> 20:31.180
Please continue.

20:33.972 --> 20:35.046
Tell her what we know.

20:35.086 --> 20:36.402
Ok, all right, um…

20:37.516 --> 20:39.500
First of all, the man
that we arrested tonight

20:39.540 --> 20:41.323
is not the man who killed your daughter.

20:41.363 --> 20:44.158
His prints don't match
any we found at the house.

20:44.198 --> 20:46.120
All right. Anything else?

20:46.323 --> 20:48.815
Are you aware that your
daughter used drugs?

20:48.855 --> 20:51.851
I see we don't have to wait for
the defense to demonize the victim.

20:51.891 --> 20:54.686
Do you know that until
recently Carla had a boyfriend?

20:54.726 --> 20:56.711
I heard about the boyfriends
when they became serious.

20:56.751 --> 21:00.975
Did you know that your daughter
put ads for sex on the internet?

21:04.648 --> 21:07.354
I don't… I don't
have my reading glasses.

21:08.393 --> 21:09.669
It's from the Jones list.

21:09.709 --> 21:13.658
It's a web site that posts
lots of different material,

21:13.760 --> 21:15.886
including personals.

21:16.291 --> 21:20.909
The heading is “beauty needs beast”, and
there's a picture of Carla on the bottom.

21:20.949 --> 21:22.863
You want me to read the text?

21:22.873 --> 21:23.479
Yes.

21:24.290 --> 21:25.363
“I'm young and sexy

21:25.403 --> 21:27.084
”And I've been very, very bad.

21:27.124 --> 21:28.805
”If you're looking
for someone to punish,

21:28.845 --> 21:31.134
”to dominate and control, I need you.

21:31.174 --> 21:32.591
”Come to 354 cedar.

21:32.693 --> 21:34.677
”I'll leave a key under
a rock by the door.

21:34.717 --> 21:36.094
”Enter quietly, undress,

21:36.134 --> 21:37.107
take me by surprise,

21:37.147 --> 21:39.233
”tape my mouth shut so I can't scream.

21:39.273 --> 21:42.675
I don't want to know your face…”
–Excuse me! Excuse me.

21:42.715 --> 21:45.449
Carla did not write that filth.

21:47.509 --> 21:48.992
Excuse me.

21:52.208 --> 21:53.804
How did you find that ad?

21:53.844 --> 21:55.542
Through someone who responded to it.

21:55.582 --> 21:56.770
It's still posted.

21:56.809 --> 22:00.450
I believe the congresswoman
would consider it a personal favor

22:00.490 --> 22:01.677
if you could get that thing down.

22:01.717 --> 22:04.234
It'll be down in the morning, trust me.

22:04.274 --> 22:06.012
Well, excuse me.

22:06.114 --> 22:06.774
We'll, um…

22:07.585 --> 22:09.152
We'll be in touch.

22:12.909 --> 22:15.216
Look, she had to find out
about it sooner or later.

22:15.256 --> 22:17.368
At the end of the investigation,

22:17.399 --> 22:18.380
not in the middle.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.808
The ad can't be changed.

22:19.848 --> 22:21.339
It's the inciting incident.

22:21.379 --> 22:23.890
Cause she was asking to be raped, Will.

22:23.930 --> 22:26.108
She wasn't asking to be murdered.

22:30.033 --> 22:31.946
Hey, what happened?

22:32.851 --> 22:36.335
I can't believe you got dressed
and came all the way down here.

22:36.375 --> 22:37.893
Hey, are you all right?

22:40.099 --> 22:41.617
–Oh.
–Ow. Sorry, sorry.

22:42.816 --> 22:43.522
It's ok.

22:48.555 --> 22:49.809
That looks painful.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.784
You should see the other guy.

22:53.991 --> 22:56.106
–Want to talk about it?
–No.

22:57.515 --> 22:59.125
No, not really, no.

22:59.729 --> 23:00.535
Ok.

23:08.889 --> 23:09.997
There ya go.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.708
That should do it.

23:16.036 --> 23:18.050
Thanks. Thanks.

23:18.150 --> 23:19.056
So, um,

23:19.458 --> 23:20.929
you've been here before.

23:20.969 --> 23:21.774
It's, um,

23:22.378 --> 23:23.847
really self-explanatory.

23:23.887 --> 23:25.297
We've got a fridge.

23:25.398 --> 23:26.505
I've got, um,

23:26.908 --> 23:30.934
milk and apple juice and stuff

23:31.035 --> 23:32.706
and the light switch is over there.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.760
I've got some cereal here,

23:34.960 --> 23:35.666
and, uh,

23:36.471 --> 23:37.638
I've got this cat that I feed.

23:37.678 --> 23:39.856
She's not very friendly, but, uh…

23:40.296 --> 23:41.465
Where are you going?

23:41.505 --> 23:42.976
Didn't you ask me to sleep over?

23:43.016 --> 23:43.618
Not here.

23:44.725 --> 23:45.833
I mean, um,

23:46.236 --> 23:49.055
–I meant on the sofa.
–Oh.

23:49.659 --> 23:51.645
I'm sorry.

23:54.037 --> 23:56.941
It's just that I've
been in a room with, uh,

23:57.128 --> 23:59.580
2 half-naked men today
already and, uh,

23:59.620 --> 24:01.666
it's just about all I can take.

24:01.813 --> 24:03.168
I completely understand.

24:03.208 --> 24:03.707
Do you?

24:04.604 --> 24:06.320
Of course I do, of course.

24:07.694 --> 24:10.984
Ok, so, um, the sofa bed,

24:11.082 --> 24:13.236
uh, you just take off the cushions…

24:13.276 --> 24:14.931
Yeah, I know how to
work a sofa bed, Brenda.

24:14.971 --> 24:15.631
It's fine.

24:15.667 --> 24:16.825
Go to sleep, get some rest.

24:16.865 --> 24:17.622
I'll see you in the morning.

24:17.662 --> 24:19.867
–Ok.
–Ok?

24:26.102 --> 24:27.217
Good night.

24:36.631 --> 24:38.536
“Women torturing men.”

24:39.338 --> 24:42.407
It's a category for guys
who haven't been married.

24:42.447 --> 24:43.911
How many of those things
are you gonna read?

24:43.951 --> 24:45.114
It's research, Tao.

24:45.154 --> 24:47.721
Got them from the personal
section of the Jones list.

24:47.761 --> 24:49.425
“Are you turned on by movies

24:49.465 --> 24:52.032
”where a hunky young sailor
is stripped to the waist,

24:52.072 --> 24:53.576
tied up, and flogged?”

24:53.777 --> 24:56.417
What is with you white people and whips?

24:56.584 --> 25:00.454
“She recreates historically accurate
scene with replicas of whipped—”

25:00.494 --> 25:02.600
Ok, lieutenant, that's enough.

25:02.901 --> 25:04.866
Just because a handful of
people are interested…

25:04.906 --> 25:06.811
Handful? Try million.

25:07.814 --> 25:08.616
A million?

25:09.518 --> 25:10.681
You're telling me a million people

25:10.721 --> 25:12.899
log on to those personals a year?

25:12.927 --> 25:13.729
No, madam.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.754
A million a week.

25:26.939 --> 25:27.742
L. A. P. D

25:27.842 --> 25:30.412
We have a warrant to
search these premises.

25:30.452 --> 25:31.556
Hey, hey, hey!

25:32.058 --> 25:34.170
Don't think about touching that,

25:34.367 --> 25:35.357
whatever it is.

25:35.872 --> 25:36.664
What's that?

25:36.776 --> 25:38.756
I'm guessing it's a degausser,

25:38.884 --> 25:44.304
a magnet here wired to erase information
on these servers here and here,

25:44.505 --> 25:46.673
kind of like an electronic toilet.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.178
Lieutenant Provenza,
could you please make sure

25:48.218 --> 25:50.387
we have all the employees
in this room, please?

25:50.427 --> 25:51.993
We run a respectable business.

25:52.033 --> 25:53.900
Mr Jones, this is a
murder investigation.

25:53.940 --> 25:58.316
–This is paramilitary interference in the exercise of free speech.
–Honey, honey, honey…

25:58.356 --> 26:00.524
No, no! It's the beginnings
of a police state!

26:00.564 --> 26:02.610
Sir, all we're asking you to do

26:02.672 --> 26:04.038
is to take down one web page

26:04.078 --> 26:05.945
and to give us the names
of everyone who's viewed it.

26:05.985 --> 26:08.454
Our customers depend
on us for their privacy.

26:08.494 --> 26:10.964
I will sue your asses
off and I'm not kidding!

26:11.004 --> 26:12.972
If you don't provide us with
the information we'll need,

26:13.012 --> 26:14.068
I'll arrest you,

26:14.116 --> 26:15.491
and I'm not kidding.

26:17.758 --> 26:18.927
We're a membership site,

26:18.967 --> 26:21.144
so we contract people
after they've logged on.

26:21.184 --> 26:24.771
Everyone who visited this young
lady's site will be in these stacks.

26:24.811 --> 26:27.431
Names, addresses, credit cards.

26:27.935 --> 26:29.507
At least we found our murderer.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.131
Now just so we're clear,

26:31.462 --> 26:33.840
we're not here to play
hall monitor to the world.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.530
We don't control content.

26:35.896 --> 26:37.972
You see nothing wrong
with facilitating rape

26:38.012 --> 26:39.134
on your web site?

26:39.221 --> 26:42.059
Look, stopping rape and
murder is your job…

26:43.352 --> 26:44.057
Not ours…

26:44.360 --> 26:44.924
So if you're done here,

26:44.964 --> 26:46.436
can we please get back
to what we were doing?

26:46.476 --> 26:47.987
Sure, absolutely, sir.

26:48.088 --> 26:49.083
Let me help.

26:51.834 --> 26:53.394
Sue me.

27:02.537 --> 27:06.422
Over 600 members of the Jones
list reviewed Carla's ad.

27:06.721 --> 27:08.772
DNA from the rape kit heavily implies

27:08.812 --> 27:11.800
that our killer is
caucasian with red hair.

27:12.597 --> 27:14.648
Since we can't trust the pictures

27:14.688 --> 27:16.142
that these guys post on the web site,

27:16.182 --> 27:18.731
we should go through
their credit cards and DMV

27:18.771 --> 27:20.751
to verify hair color and race.

27:22.158 --> 27:22.955
Also,

27:23.055 --> 27:25.504
judging from what the ME.
found under Carla's fingernails,

27:25.544 --> 27:26.998
she got a good swipe at our guy.

27:27.038 --> 27:29.189
So look for scratches on the face,

27:29.229 --> 27:30.285
neck, and chest.

27:32.815 --> 27:34.267
You got any grandkids?

27:35.205 --> 27:36.779
Great grandkids?

27:45.852 --> 27:48.888
Do you know where I
might find Corey Horowitz?

27:53.070 --> 27:53.994
Are you Corey?

27:55.276 --> 27:56.178
Yes, I am.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.245
Your license says you have red hair.

27:59.285 --> 28:00.949
Yeah, well, I did at the time.

28:00.989 --> 28:02.705
What's your natural color?

28:03.896 --> 28:04.698
You, uh…

28:05.600 --> 28:06.722
Want to find out?

28:07.104 --> 28:07.806
Chief.

28:08.507 --> 28:11.976
Now why don't you try showing
the lady a little respect, dude,

28:12.016 --> 28:13.930
and answer the damn question.

28:14.622 --> 28:16.527
It's brown. Brown hair.

28:16.627 --> 28:17.790
It's all right, sergeant Gabriel.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.995
Thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedule,

28:20.035 --> 28:20.837
Mr Horowitz.

28:23.143 --> 28:25.189
Uh, could anyone other than you

28:25.348 --> 28:26.310
have used your credit card

28:26.350 --> 28:28.396
and computer to access this ad?

28:29.358 --> 28:30.744
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:31.162 --> 28:32.325
I'm the pledge master around here,

28:32.365 --> 28:34.129
so I let a lot of guys log on.

28:34.169 --> 28:36.677
Do any of those pledges have red hair?

28:47.101 --> 28:49.868
–Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, L. A. P. D
–Oh, thank god.

28:49.908 --> 28:51.271
You found the attacker.

28:51.311 --> 28:51.839
Jeffrey.

28:53.717 --> 28:54.880
You did, didn't you?

28:54.920 --> 28:57.824
You found the person
who did this to my son?

28:58.228 --> 29:00.208
Yes, madam, I believe we have.

29:13.473 --> 29:15.633
Do you waive your right
to an attorney, Jeffrey,

29:15.673 --> 29:17.632
or do you want your mother
in here to hire one for you?

29:17.672 --> 29:19.850
No, no, I don't want an attorney.

29:21.972 --> 29:24.150
Your prints from the crime scene.

29:25.072 --> 29:26.128
Your blood type.

29:26.672 --> 29:28.332
What do you want to bet
I get a DNA match tomorrow

29:28.372 --> 29:30.731
and I won't need you to tell
me your side of the story?

29:30.771 --> 29:34.031
You'll be under arrest for the
rape and murder of Carla Simmons.

29:34.071 --> 29:36.730
Now is your only chance
to tell me what happened.

29:36.770 --> 29:39.212
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

29:42.169 --> 29:44.829
Ok, I guess I'll go break
the news to your mother.

29:44.869 --> 29:46.783
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

29:48.268 --> 29:48.796
Oh, god.

29:49.168 --> 29:51.228
I told them this was gonna happen.

29:51.268 --> 29:52.068
Told who?

29:54.067 --> 29:55.519
Those fraternity boys?

29:58.467 --> 30:00.426
I know you don't want
to tell on them, I do,

30:00.466 --> 30:01.786
but this is serious.

30:02.166 --> 30:03.420
Look where you are.

30:13.064 --> 30:14.384
They gave me the ad.

30:15.565 --> 30:18.524
But they said I didn't have
the balls to do it, you know?

30:18.564 --> 30:20.024
And they were taking bets, right?

30:20.064 --> 30:22.364
So… I had to try.

30:24.863 --> 30:27.569
When I got to her
house, I found the key,

30:28.563 --> 30:30.543
and I snuck in the front door.

30:31.062 --> 30:32.778
I took off all my clothes.

30:33.462 --> 30:35.122
I had the tape ready. I just…

30:35.162 --> 30:37.621
I just did what it said to do in the ad.

30:37.661 --> 30:38.461
Of course.

30:39.461 --> 30:40.361
Of course.

30:40.761 --> 30:42.520
And she was wrestling with me.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.360
I had her…

30:43.660 --> 30:44.160
Chief.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.486
Ms Simmons.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.819
I thought she was into it, you know?

30:47.859 --> 30:50.631
It was just supposed
to be wild. Just sex.

30:51.059 --> 30:53.765
They said she was
probably a dog, anyway.

30:54.658 --> 30:56.110
But she ended up dead.

30:57.158 --> 30:59.318
It's not like I meant to hurt her.

30:59.358 --> 30:59.957
And, um,

31:00.657 --> 31:01.857
when I finished,

31:02.557 --> 31:05.527
when I let her up, she
got, like, hysterical.

31:06.957 --> 31:08.343
She tried to kill me…

31:10.157 --> 31:11.217
and I'm not kidding.

31:11.257 --> 31:12.416
She pulled a lamp out of the wall

31:12.456 --> 31:14.700
and she hit me in the head with it

31:15.256 --> 31:18.215
and she was just screaming
like she was crazy.

31:18.255 --> 31:18.955
Look.

31:24.754 --> 31:26.866
Then she broke this glass thing.

31:29.354 --> 31:30.853
She… she gouged me

31:30.953 --> 31:33.065
and she was slashing at my neck.

31:33.853 --> 31:35.569
She was trying to kill me.

31:37.652 --> 31:39.038
So I pushed her away.

31:40.952 --> 31:43.922
And then she smashed
her head on the dresser.

31:44.751 --> 31:46.533
And I tried to help her up.

31:48.950 --> 31:52.184
But then her face just
went white, you know, and…

31:55.550 --> 31:57.200
I didn't know what to do.

31:59.850 --> 32:01.038
Then she was dead.

32:11.748 --> 32:13.247
So I… I just… I left.

32:15.347 --> 32:16.507
And I locked the door behind me

32:16.547 --> 32:18.247
and I… I kept the key,

32:18.547 --> 32:21.517
and I didn't want anyone
else to go in there.

32:23.246 --> 32:25.490
But I didn't know what else to do.

32:27.745 --> 32:30.125
I didn't know what else to do.

32:38.582 --> 32:39.673
Bathroom.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.082
Uh, this way.

32:43.631 --> 32:44.398
What…

32:44.500 --> 32:45.820
At least we got him.

32:45.826 --> 32:46.948
Got him for what?

32:47.152 --> 32:50.785
Sergeant, we can't get him for breaking
and entering because Carla left the key.

32:50.825 --> 32:51.907
We can't arrest him for rape

32:51.947 --> 32:53.642
because he reasonably
thought he had consent,

32:53.682 --> 32:55.172
And if we go after him for murder,

32:55.212 --> 32:56.090
he'll argue self-defense

32:56.130 --> 32:58.068
because Carla fought back.

32:58.374 --> 32:59.763
Well, that's for a jury
to decide, isn't it?

32:59.803 --> 33:00.987
Because from where I was sitting,

33:01.027 --> 33:01.905
that was a confession.

33:01.945 --> 33:03.595
Why do we not arrest him?

33:04.291 --> 33:05.149
What's wrong?

33:05.720 --> 33:06.578
What's wrong?

33:09.392 --> 33:11.966
What's wrong is that Carla fought back.

33:16.756 --> 33:18.145
Every time you go on-line,

33:18.185 --> 33:21.419
it's like your computer's
having unprotected sex.

33:21.449 --> 33:23.960
And whatever it collects stays with it.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.716
Whatever Carla Simmons did

33:25.734 --> 33:27.120
is on her hard drive.

33:27.366 --> 33:28.026
Somewhere.

33:28.386 --> 33:30.490
Can you show me how she placed her ad?

33:30.530 --> 33:31.040
Yeah.

33:31.346 --> 33:34.060
See, she had auto-fill
for forms like this,

33:34.100 --> 33:36.345
including her credit card, see?

33:36.104 --> 33:38.450
So she would type in whatever copy.

33:39.776 --> 33:41.919
She would attach a photo

33:42.123 --> 33:43.511
from one of her albums.

33:43.551 --> 33:44.673
She liked photos.

33:45.081 --> 33:46.918
And… Boom.

33:47.122 --> 33:48.714
Was she a regular on this site?

33:48.754 --> 33:49.570
Jones list?

33:49.876 --> 33:51.130
No. Just this once.

33:51.202 --> 33:53.305
What about other dating services sites?

33:53.345 --> 33:54.671
No, nothing like it.

33:54.977 --> 33:57.487
Um, an auction account at
eBay. I mean, that's it.

33:57.527 --> 34:00.038
Is there a date and time stamp
on this ad, by any chance?

34:00.078 --> 34:00.996
Yes, indeed.

34:01.098 --> 34:03.404
Can you print it out
again for me, please?

34:03.444 --> 34:04.158
Certainly.

34:04.261 --> 34:05.977
Thank you, lieutenant Tao.

34:07.977 --> 34:10.426
Boss, you have a confession.

34:10.630 --> 34:13.485
What exactly are you trying to prove?

34:13.690 --> 34:15.629
Intent, lieutenant Tao.

34:15.935 --> 34:16.507
Because without intent,

34:16.547 --> 34:17.998
we don't have a murder

34:18.281 --> 34:19.931
and our rapist goes free.

34:25.406 --> 34:26.304
–Hey.
–Fritz.

34:26.404 --> 34:27.062
I was on my way home.

34:27.101 --> 34:27.760
I thought I'd check in,

34:27.800 --> 34:28.857
see how you were holding up.

34:28.897 --> 34:31.092
Oh. I'm fine.

34:31.591 --> 34:32.887
Sorry. I guess I…

34:34.284 --> 34:35.340
Yeah, I guess I…

34:36.179 --> 34:38.092
I guess I should have called.

34:38.174 --> 34:41.143
Well, I wanted to take
a look at you, anyway.

34:42.364 --> 34:43.420
You seem better.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.614
Well, we found the guy
we were hunting for.

34:45.655 --> 34:46.851
Took all day, but…

34:46.952 --> 34:47.710
That's great.

34:47.750 --> 34:48.547
That's good.

34:49.346 --> 34:51.739
So, you ok being on your own?

34:51.940 --> 34:52.538
Yeah.

34:53.036 --> 34:54.194
And thanks for last night.

34:54.234 --> 34:57.626
I guess I sort of felt
like I needed someone there.

34:58.623 --> 34:59.481
Being needed…

35:00.319 --> 35:03.817
that's the next best thing
to being wanted, isn't it?

35:04.508 --> 35:06.264
Listen, why don't you give me a
call when you have a free minute?

35:06.304 --> 35:09.670
These things have a way
of sneaking back up on you.

35:12.090 --> 35:12.789
Brenda?

35:13.288 --> 35:13.886
Yeah.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.178
Thanks.

35:18.275 --> 35:19.372
Later. Bye now.

35:20.968 --> 35:22.090
Yeah. Good night.

35:22.165 --> 35:23.522
Lieutenant Tao, I want pictures

35:23.562 --> 35:25.716
off these internet
dating sites of every guy

35:25.756 --> 35:27.612
between the ages of 20 and 35

35:27.652 --> 35:29.607
in the Los Angeles county area.

35:29.647 --> 35:31.103
Get everyone here to help you.

35:31.143 --> 35:32.595
And, sergeant Gabriel,

35:32.839 --> 35:35.891
I want to bring someone in to
look at a picture of Jeffrey,

35:35.931 --> 35:37.779
now that we have our killer.

35:43.632 --> 35:44.579
You know, chief,

35:44.619 --> 35:46.650
these guys hardly ever
look like their picture.

35:46.690 --> 35:47.341
As it so happens,

35:47.381 --> 35:50.005
I'm more interested in how
they describe themselves.

35:50.045 --> 35:50.538
Right.

35:51.426 --> 35:53.802
And I read Playboy for the articles.

36:13.900 --> 36:16.342
Do you ever see either of these guys?

36:17.213 --> 36:18.919
Uh, just Larry there.

36:19.321 --> 36:20.311
I met him once.

36:22.835 --> 36:23.738
Hi.

36:24.341 --> 36:24.943
Hi.

36:25.445 --> 36:26.963
I heard Brett was here.

36:27.051 --> 36:29.119
But he can't identify our suspect.

36:29.159 --> 36:30.565
Oh, well, that's ok.

36:31.569 --> 36:33.483
Our suspect confessed anyway.

36:33.878 --> 36:36.548
We just have a few odds
and ends to clear up.

36:36.588 --> 36:38.238
Just a few odds and ends.

36:38.496 --> 36:41.166
Sergeant Gabriel, did you ask
him if he wanted an attorney?

36:41.206 --> 36:41.969
Oh, that's all right.

36:42.009 --> 36:42.973
He doesn't have to.

36:43.013 --> 36:43.739
No, no, no.

36:43.816 --> 36:45.382
If you let these detectives
break the rules once,

36:45.422 --> 36:46.789
they do it every time.

36:46.829 --> 36:49.198
Do you wish to waive your right
to an attorney at this time?

36:49.238 --> 36:50.543
Sure. Thanks.

36:51.146 --> 36:54.314
Ok. I have to watch them
every second, honestly.

36:54.659 --> 36:55.663
So, um,

36:55.864 --> 36:57.330
there are a few things to straighten out

36:57.370 --> 36:58.635
and I want to give you back your stuff,

36:58.675 --> 36:59.779
but first,

37:00.381 --> 37:02.550
since you were so
close to Carla and all,

37:02.590 --> 37:03.996
we wanted to tell you

37:05.501 --> 37:07.168
that she was raped and murdered

37:07.208 --> 37:09.702
because of this ad on the internet.

37:15.995 --> 37:16.797
Oh, my god.

37:17.298 --> 37:17.900
I know.

37:18.301 --> 37:20.266
I never thought she'd take it this far.

37:20.306 --> 37:20.967
Well, you know,

37:21.007 --> 37:22.772
that's what a lot of people said.

37:22.812 --> 37:23.774
So we looked into it,

37:23.814 --> 37:25.378
and it turns out you're right.

37:25.418 --> 37:29.328
This ad was placed by somebody
else using her computer.

37:29.829 --> 37:32.395
There's a date and
time stamp on it, see?

37:32.435 --> 37:35.705
And when this horrible rape
solicitation went up on the Jones list,

37:35.745 --> 37:37.509
we've confirmed that Carla was at work.

37:37.549 --> 37:41.113
It was put on-line using
the auto-fill on her browser.

37:42.662 --> 37:43.825
But there's another reason we know

37:43.865 --> 37:45.328
Carla didn't place this ad,

37:45.368 --> 37:46.531
a much better reason,

37:46.571 --> 37:47.495
in my opinion.

37:49.178 --> 37:50.234
And what's that?

37:50.481 --> 37:51.537
She fought back.

37:52.085 --> 37:53.248
And why would she have done that

37:53.288 --> 37:55.268
if rape was what she intended?

37:57.398 --> 37:59.563
She didn't even know
about the Jones list, no.

37:59.603 --> 38:01.067
Someone else put up this ad.

38:01.107 --> 38:03.473
Someone who had access to her computer.

38:03.513 --> 38:04.877
Someone who knew her work schedule.

38:04.917 --> 38:06.982
Someone who could get
in and out of her house.

38:07.022 --> 38:09.287
And the landlord only issued 2 keys,

38:09.327 --> 38:11.393
and he's 71, doesn't know the
first thing about computers,

38:11.433 --> 38:14.007
and the only other key belonged to you.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.911
What? Are you suggesting
that I put that ad up?

38:18.951 --> 38:21.063
Oh, no, I'm not suggesting that.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.464
I can prove it.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.617
Here's another ad you placed
of yourself on another web site.

38:28.657 --> 38:29.859
Found it this evening.

38:29.899 --> 38:31.153
And under turnoffs,

38:31.244 --> 38:32.446
you put “control freak.”

38:32.486 --> 38:33.624
Kind of ironic,

38:33.728 --> 38:35.033
under the circumstances.

38:35.073 --> 38:37.779
And in this ad that
you placed for Carla,

38:37.867 --> 38:39.173
you misspelled “control”

38:39.213 --> 38:42.628
the same way both times with 2 L's.

38:46.354 --> 38:47.278
You know what?

38:48.216 --> 38:50.064
This is all bullshit, madam.

38:50.597 --> 38:51.281
I'm leaving.

38:51.321 --> 38:53.454
Oh, I wouldn't do that
if I were you, Brett,

38:53.494 --> 38:54.075
for 2 reasons.

38:54.115 --> 38:57.594
First, because we can't arrest
you for rape on this evidence,

38:57.634 --> 39:00.078
unless you really believed
someone would act on your phony ad,

39:00.118 --> 39:01.527
and I don't know how we'd prove that.

39:01.567 --> 39:03.803
and second, because how you
react in the next few minutes

39:03.843 --> 39:07.425
is what the DA. will look at when
deciding whether or not to press charges.

39:07.465 --> 39:08.983
And you're being taped.

39:09.018 --> 39:11.255
Walking out that door
makes you look guilty,

39:11.295 --> 39:13.532
like you wanted the
girl to get what she got.

39:13.572 --> 39:15.188
And you didn't, did you, Brett?

39:15.228 --> 39:17.258
Please tell me you didn't
want her to be raped.

39:17.298 --> 39:18.707
Cause if that's not what you intended,

39:18.747 --> 39:22.536
a judge will throw any charges that we're
trying to file straight out of court.

39:22.576 --> 39:24.295
You didn't physically
touch her yourself,

39:24.335 --> 39:25.434
you didn't attack her,

39:25.474 --> 39:26.779
but if you walk out right now,

39:26.819 --> 39:28.849
that makes it look like
that's what you wanted.

39:28.889 --> 39:31.747
Did you expect people
to read that ad, Brett?

39:31.787 --> 39:33.371
Act on it? Murder Carla?

39:33.442 --> 39:34.168
No! No! No!

39:34.995 --> 39:36.645
That's not what I wanted!

39:37.892 --> 39:38.720
I loved her.

39:39.962 --> 39:41.204
I loved her, ok?

39:41.825 --> 39:42.881
I mean, this is…

39:42.963 --> 39:44.890
This is all some horrible mistake,

39:44.930 --> 39:45.854
and I'm sorry.

39:47.310 --> 39:49.290
I didn't want her to get hurt.

39:55.095 --> 39:56.151
Listen, this is…

39:57.603 --> 39:58.103
Look…

39:59.205 --> 40:01.710
This… this is what happened,

40:01.810 --> 40:02.813
2 weeks ago,

40:03.414 --> 40:05.918
she was… she was driving my car

40:06.520 --> 40:07.840
and we were arguing,

40:08.824 --> 40:10.672
and she gunned it in reverse

40:10.827 --> 40:12.090
and I lost it for a second

40:12.130 --> 40:13.292
and I punched her in the arm.

40:13.332 --> 40:14.454
that's all I did.

40:15.736 --> 40:18.702
I mean, she wasn't even bruised
and I apologized several times,

40:18.742 --> 40:21.406
and she broke up with
me for that one thing,

40:21.446 --> 40:22.909
and I begged her to forgive me.

40:22.949 --> 40:24.813
I explained to her over and over.

40:24.853 --> 40:26.616
I called her a hundred times,

40:26.656 --> 40:28.720
and she never once responded to me.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.164
So you were hurt and you were angry.

40:31.364 --> 40:32.222
Right, right.

40:35.772 --> 40:36.894
I posted that ad.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.100
That's the truth.

40:42.785 --> 40:45.689
But I didn't want
anything to happen to her.

40:48.395 --> 40:49.998
Well, thank you, Brett.

40:51.902 --> 40:52.563
It's not pretty,

40:52.603 --> 40:54.367
but at least we know the truth.

40:54.407 --> 40:55.308
I'm sorry.

40:59.315 --> 41:00.437
I'm really sorry.

41:01.920 --> 41:05.687
I'm sorrier about this than anything
I've ever done in my entire life.

41:05.727 --> 41:07.551
I know.

41:15.344 --> 41:17.077
Well… um…

41:20.185 --> 41:22.891
here's the stuff Carla
packed up for you.

41:23.082 --> 41:26.250
I'll give you the stuff
and you give me the key.

41:28.477 --> 41:29.076
The key?

41:30.475 --> 41:31.534
Yeah. To Carla's house.

41:31.574 --> 41:33.332
That was the deal you had with her.

41:33.372 --> 41:34.431
She'd give you back your stuff,

41:34.471 --> 41:36.583
and you'd give her back the key.

41:38.368 --> 41:40.678
Oh, yeah. I must have, uh, lost it.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.764
Really? Well…

41:44.763 --> 41:47.560
The landlord only issued 2 keys,

41:47.660 --> 41:48.859
one she kept

41:49.658 --> 41:51.956
and the other she gave to you.

41:52.655 --> 41:55.153
Right. That's mine. You found it.

41:55.253 --> 41:58.883
No. I got it from the guy
who raped and murdered Carla.

41:59.449 --> 42:03.105
He found it outside her house underneath
the rock where you said it would be…

42:03.145 --> 42:04.045
in the ad.

42:04.145 --> 42:04.704
So tell me, Brett,

42:04.744 --> 42:06.702
if you didn't mean for
anyone to rape Carla,

42:06.742 --> 42:08.986
why did you leave the key for him?

42:17.713 --> 42:18.915
Oh, shoot.

42:20.918 --> 42:21.880
Now we have a problem.

42:21.920 --> 42:22.781
Oh, yes, we do,

42:22.821 --> 42:24.524
because if someone dies

42:24.624 --> 42:26.788
as a direct result of the
commission of a felony,

42:26.828 --> 42:29.333
Say like solicitation of rape,

42:29.633 --> 42:31.536
and there was proven intent…

42:31.636 --> 42:33.418
That's first degree murder.

42:37.846 --> 42:39.609
I thought if she knew what
real violence was like,

42:39.649 --> 42:43.015
then she'd know that what
I did was really nothing…

42:45.358 --> 42:47.536
And she would… she would call me.

42:52.670 --> 42:54.782
It was just supposed to be rape.

43:04.570 --> 43:05.770
–Chief?
–Yes?

43:05.870 --> 43:07.190
Chief, she's coming.

43:12.672 --> 43:13.472
–Hi.
–Hi.

43:14.772 --> 43:16.132
I wanted to thank you in person.

43:16.172 --> 43:18.734
Um, Mr Pope here let me read
the transcript of the interview

43:18.774 --> 43:21.348
and I think that will hold up in court.

43:21.774 --> 43:23.435
That's Brenda's specialty.

43:23.475 --> 43:25.175
Thank you. Thanks.

43:26.675 --> 43:29.036
Um, congresswoman Simmons, I'm sorry…

43:29.076 --> 43:31.076
No, I made it worse for myself

43:31.176 --> 43:32.496
by demanding to know

43:32.577 --> 43:35.137
what was going on every step of the way.

43:35.177 --> 43:37.538
I think I could've
spared myself some doubts

43:37.578 --> 43:38.538
about my daughter

43:38.578 --> 43:40.822
if I had just let you do your job.

43:44.179 --> 43:45.895
I can't begin to thank you

43:47.180 --> 43:50.612
for proving that she was
the girl I thought she was.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.534
But I did know her.

43:55.981 --> 43:57.882
So… thank you.

43:58.482 --> 43:59.472
You're welcome.

44:03.883 --> 44:04.483
You ok?

44:04.683 --> 44:07.386
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

44:29.932 --> 44:30.734
Hey, Fritz?

44:32.037 --> 44:35.444
Yeah. Um… no, no,
no, I haven't slept yet.

44:36.948 --> 44:39.522
Look, I was wondering
if you wanted to…

44:39.754 --> 44:41.536
Have you had breakfast yet?

44:44.364 --> 44:48.072
I want to have breakfast
with you this morning…

44:49.976 --> 44:52.220
If you're available and you don't…

44:55.889 --> 44:58.496
Oh, I have no idea where that is.

45:02.204 --> 45:04.309
Ok. All right,

45:04.409 --> 45:07.511
but you have to give me
really good directions.

45:07.817 --> 45:10.022
Ok. Uh-huh.

45:10.523 --> 45:13.329
So I take a right on Figueroa,

45:13.930 --> 45:17.939
Which is that, which way is it?

45:18.340 --> 45:20.225
Are there 2 Figueroas?
