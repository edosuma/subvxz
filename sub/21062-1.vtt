Nova:
Last season
on "Queen Sugar"...

00:03.670 --> 00:05.467
Charley:
"To my children
I bequeath 800 acres."

00:05.500 --> 00:07.229
Why can't you do
what Daddy wanted?

00:07.270 --> 00:08.430
He wanted to win!

00:08.470 --> 00:10.301
_ You're the one
taking care of thIs place.

00:10.340 --> 00:12.570
"I'm revising my last will
and testament."

00:12.610 --> 00:15.602
I need to move on,
and you're not mine to have.

00:15.640 --> 00:19.110
- Violet: I just needed time.
- Now I need time.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.414
Davis on recording:
I pay you to do shit
my wife won't do.

00:21.450 --> 00:23.486
' ( crying )_
- The only thing
you care about is yourself.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.647
Charley,
you're an incredible woman.

00:25.690 --> 00:28.215
Nova: _
Can you Imagine
a black woman owning

00:28.260 --> 00:30.626
and operating
her own mill?

00:30.660 --> 00:31.752
( music playing )

00:31.790 --> 00:34.122
* Hold up, wait a minute

00:34.160 --> 00:36.196
* Baby, baby,
are you listening? *

00:36.230 --> 00:38.369
* I go and you go

00:38.400 --> 00:40.265
* But I don't ever
wanna see your face *

00:40.300 --> 00:44.839
* No, no, no
second, third chances *

00:44.870 --> 00:47.179
* In my hands
I hold your life span *

00:47.210 --> 00:48.609
* 'Cau_se no one
does It better *

00:48.640 --> 00:50.540
* Keep that -- tight,
hold it down *

00:50.580 --> 00:52.741
* Storm the weather

00:52.780 --> 00:55.578
* Now we at a crossroad,
now we at the break *

00:55.620 --> 00:58.441
* All this back-and-forth --,
we gonna lose our way *

00:58.490 --> 01:01.084
* All I got is one life
and one life to live *

01:01.120 --> 01:03.054
* You dig?
You dig? *

01:03.090 --> 01:06.821
* If I told you I'ma ride,
then you know I'm down to
drive, drive, drive *

01:06.860 --> 01:11.229
* And, baby, we can do it
all night, night, night... *

01:12.800 --> 01:16.566
So, I had a good time
last night.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.703
Me, too.

01:18.740 --> 01:21.277
Maybe--

01:21.310 --> 01:24.848
maybe we can get together
again one of these days.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.245
Yeah.

01:29.650 --> 01:33.188
Have a good day.
Okay?

01:34.420 --> 01:37.355
Yeah.
Y-you, too.

01:37.390 --> 01:38.618
Okay.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.589
( theme music playing )

01:46.640 --> 01:50.508
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

01:50.540 --> 01:54.271
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the world
turns *

01:54.310 --> 01:57.108
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight *

01:58.750 --> 02:00.718
* Dreams never die

02:06.220 --> 02:09.826
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

02:09.860 --> 02:13.853
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight. *

02:13.900 --> 02:16.664
Which bring us
to the key data set.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.362
Operating income
before depreciation

02:19.400 --> 02:21.334
plus cash
and non-cash expenses

02:21.370 --> 02:23.838
all the way down
to profit after taxes.

02:23.870 --> 02:27.636
Now all I need is your loan
to make the necessary upgrades.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.375
Remy:
Two-thirds
of the black farmers

02:29.410 --> 02:31.378
have already agreed
to mill with Queen Sugar,

02:31.410 --> 02:35.369
and another 32 are willing
to make the switch

02:35.420 --> 02:38.241
upon the mill
securing this loan
for future improvements.

02:38.290 --> 02:40.451
In other words,
I already have

02:40.490 --> 02:42.378
more than enough farmers
milling with me

02:42.430 --> 02:44.853
to put me in the black
in year one.

02:44.890 --> 02:46.528
And don't forget,
I also have

02:46.560 --> 02:49.358
a guaranteed stream of income
from my own cane farm.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.220
Very impressive.

02:52.370 --> 02:53.462
We're in.

02:54.540 --> 02:56.201
We'll send over
the proper paperwork

02:56.240 --> 02:58.231
for you and Davis to sign.

03:00.440 --> 03:03.204
Actually,
this is my business.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.571
Davis has nothing
to do with it.

03:05.610 --> 03:09.239
Uh, we thought
you were partners
in all your ventures.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.587
Without his involvement,

03:10.620 --> 03:12.952
I'm not sure _
we can underwrite
the full amount.

03:12.990 --> 03:14.582
It's his brand.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.555
That's what's
most attractive
to our partners.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.319
I see.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.224
Then...

03:23.270 --> 03:24.897
we will make it happen.

03:24.930 --> 03:26.431
( chuckles )

03:26.470 --> 03:28.995
Look forward
to doing business
with you, Mrs. West.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.531
- Absolutely.
- Man: We look forward
to working with you.

03:31.570 --> 03:32.878
- Thanks for coming out.
- Thank you so much.

03:32.910 --> 03:34.275
- Yeah.
- Remy, thank you.

03:34.310 --> 03:35.834
Thank you.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.474
- It's been a pleasure.
- We'll be in touch.
Thank you.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.926
- Thanks for your help.
- Mm-hmm.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.336
Wanna grab a drink
and celebrate?

03:59.370 --> 04:01.634
Celebrate?

04:01.670 --> 04:04.309
Charley,
you just got blindsided.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.603
I guess I should be
used to people thinking

04:08.640 --> 04:10.699
there's no me without Davis.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.944
Well, can you blame them?

04:11.980 --> 04:15.746
I mean,
you two are still together
as far as the world knows.

04:15.780 --> 04:16.849
Not for long.

04:18.390 --> 04:19.755
( sighs )

04:19.790 --> 04:23.578
Our lavwers are working
on terms right now, and--

04:23.630 --> 04:25.621
And once it's safe
for you to be seen drinking

04:25.660 --> 04:27.821
with another man,
then we can toast to that.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.725
But for now, I...

04:33.700 --> 04:36.533
For now, I think
it's best for both of us

04:36.570 --> 04:38.800
if we just keep things
professional.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.270
Excuse me.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.820
- ( music playing
- ( chatter) )

05:00.860 --> 05:02.828
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, Prosper.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.622
How was your breakfast
this morning?

05:04.670 --> 05:06.729
Well, it ain't your cooking,
but it damn sure

05:06.770 --> 05:08.988
getting better and better
as the week go by.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.905
( laughs )

05:10.940 --> 05:12.828
What are doing
to them boys back there?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.609
Ah, no boys.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.473
I'm training these ladies
from over at the halfway house.

05:17.510 --> 05:18.977
They're picking it up
real nice.

05:19.010 --> 05:21.114
You don't say.

05:21.150 --> 05:22.845
That's good of you, Vi,
real good.

05:22.890 --> 05:26.656
Well, Ralph Angel taught me
about second chances.

05:26.690 --> 05:29.818
We all deserve 'em.
There you go, baby.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.987
Amen to that.

05:32.030 --> 05:33.998
Well, I'm gonna get on.

05:34.030 --> 05:36.521
We're gonna be
tuning the bells
for Juneteenth.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.822
Mm, my favorite part
of the summer.

05:38.870 --> 05:40.667
Yes, indeed.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.804
- You have a blessed day.
- You, too.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.000
Blue:
Faster, Pop!

05:50.050 --> 05:52.917
Ralph Angel:
Hey, I'm going fast
as I can, Blue.

05:54.880 --> 05:55.915
All right.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.144
- ( groans )
- That was fun.

05:59.190 --> 06:00.157
I told you.

06:00.190 --> 06:01.851
Come on, man.

06:01.890 --> 06:04.484
Come on.
( grunts )

06:04.530 --> 06:06.748
You got it?
Come on, boy.

06:08.630 --> 06:09.767
Where you at?
Come on.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.064
- I'm here to show this.
-(laughs)

06:12.100 --> 06:13.829
You know what that is?

06:13.870 --> 06:15.667
- Mm...
-Hmm?

06:15.700 --> 06:16.405
Dirt?

06:16.440 --> 06:19.034
I guess you could
call it that.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.776
I call it Blue's Corner.

06:20.810 --> 06:25.440
- My own corner?
- Mm-hmm, that's right.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.448
This is your land, son.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.539
A little piece
of the world.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.615
No matter what happens,

06:31.650 --> 06:34.710
good things, bad things,
happy things, sad things,

06:34.760 --> 06:37.888
you can always
come here...

06:37.930 --> 06:39.625
and smile...

06:39.660 --> 06:43.699
and know that Pops
and Mama love you.

06:43.730 --> 06:45.493
- All right?
- Okay.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.669
All right,
go check it out.

06:52.610 --> 06:54.737
You_ talk
to your Sisters yet?

06:56.480 --> 06:58.505
( sighs )
Soon as I tell 'em,

06:58.550 --> 07:00.973
they'll try
and take it from me.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.443
You don't know that.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.981
Look, let's just
enjoy this while we can.

07:06.020 --> 07:07.885
Okay.

07:08.820 --> 07:11.721
I'm glad you're here.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.057
So am I.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.421
*

07:24.810 --> 07:28.507
* Feeling it like
I just need to speak
my brain *

07:28.540 --> 07:30.542
* Yes, I know
it might seem like *

07:30.580 --> 07:32.810
* I'm going to
cause you pain *

07:32.850 --> 07:34.738
* Boy, you've got
to realize *

07:34.780 --> 07:36.509
* I've got to get
all this... *

07:36.550 --> 07:39.713
- You having a good time?
- I am. You know, this is
so dope.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.480
* I've got to lose
my cool, yeah *

07:43.530 --> 07:44.827
* Feelin' it like... *

07:44.860 --> 07:46.521
- ( music playing
- ( chatter) )

07:46.560 --> 07:48.699
This place
has an incredible
art collection.

07:48.730 --> 07:51.494
- Mm.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:51.530 --> 07:54.033
I'm hoping to get something
on these walls one day.

07:54.070 --> 07:56.265
Wait, I didn't know
you painted.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.975
Just means there's more to me
you have to get to know.

08:00.010 --> 08:01.602
Oh, yeah?

08:09.550 --> 08:11.643
Well, um...

08:11.690 --> 08:14.989
I just wanted
to thank you both
for lunch.

08:15.020 --> 08:18.080
It's definitely
one of the best
birthday presents

08:18.130 --> 08:22.089
I've gotten this year,
so thank you.

08:22.130 --> 08:24.189
Um... (laughs)
Pardon me.

08:24.230 --> 08:26.733
I love me some Creole food,
but ain't nothing better

08:26.770 --> 08:28.738
than that car _
we just pulled up in.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.629
No, that car is not
just a car, though.

08:33.680 --> 08:37.901
It's my dad trying to buy me
or apologize,

08:37.950 --> 08:40.214
feel better
about himself.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.515
It's a lot of things,
but it's definitely
not just a car.

08:50.630 --> 08:54.555
Don't let your father's issues
spoil your special day, okay?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.594
I love you, Micah.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.528
Love you, too.

09:02.670 --> 09:05.138
(TV playing
in background )

09:32.400 --> 09:35.699
( beeps, line rings )

09:36.300 --> 09:37.733
This is Hollywood.

09:37.770 --> 09:39.169
Can't get to the phone
right now,

09:39.210 --> 09:40.973
but you know what to do.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.674
( phone rings )

09:49.120 --> 09:50.246
Hey, Nova.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.212
- Aunt Vi!
- Uh-huh?

09:52.250 --> 09:55.117
I'm on the run,
but I wanna take Charley out
for Micah's birthday.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.823
You wanna take Charley out
for her son's birthday?

09:58.860 --> 10:00.851
Hell, yeah, 16 years ago,
we were all waiting

10:00.900 --> 10:02.197
for that little sucker
to come into the world

10:02.230 --> 10:04.221
while she was screaming up
a storm, remember?

10:04.270 --> 10:07.091
- I do.
- Calls for celebration.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.735
You just wanna man-hunt.
You ain't fooling nobody.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.237
Are we rolling or not?

10:12.270 --> 10:14.101
( laughs )

10:14.140 --> 10:17.007
Okay, good.
I'm gonna see you tonight.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.042
- ( squeals )
- Oh, my God, wow.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.810
- You look so... _
- Huge? You can say it.

10:22.850 --> 10:25.045
You've never been one
to mince words.

10:25.090 --> 10:29.117
- ( both laugh )
- Sis, you look radiant.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.651
These are for the twins.

10:31.690 --> 10:35.421
Oh, it's so beautiful!

10:35.460 --> 10:37.428
Did you do this yourself?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.062
Can I open 'em now?

10:39.100 --> 10:41.398
Wait until their birthday.
Promise?

10:41.440 --> 10:44.204
Once you see what they are,
you'll know who gets what.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.004
All right, promise.
( laughs )

10:47.040 --> 10:48.974
Girl, look,
my mom is so happy

10:49.010 --> 10:52.275
I'm finally giving
her some grandbabies,
she went overboard.

10:52.310 --> 10:54.744
- You could paint a onesie--
- Is that Carmella?

10:54.780 --> 10:57.419
- Mm-hmm.
_- I haven't seen her
Since our last reunion.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.008
- Nova!
- Asantewa!

10:59.050 --> 11:00.688
Yes, girl.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.984
Ladies,
look who just arrived.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.429
But aren't you scared?

11:04.460 --> 11:06.382
I mean, doing it
without a partner?

11:06.430 --> 11:07.954
- Takes guts.
- It does.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.027
Yes. I mean, you know,
it is scary, I can't lie.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.265
But a good scary,

11:14.300 --> 11:17.929
even if, as my mama would say,
I'm doing it out of order.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.460
Who says it has to be
in order?

11:19.510 --> 11:23.298
I mean,
no offense to your mama,
but that idea's outdated,

11:23.350 --> 11:25.841
just like the idea
that we're incomplete

11:25.880 --> 11:27.711
without a partner
and kids.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.172
- Yeah.
- Carmella: I guess.

11:29.220 --> 11:32.144
To each her own.
But I'll be honest with y'all.

11:32.190 --> 11:36.058
I never thought
I'd be single
at this age.

11:36.090 --> 11:38.183
And even though
my clock is ticking,

11:38.230 --> 11:41.927
I want my man first
and then my family,
no offense, Sisi.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.758
And if that makes me
old-fashioned,

11:44.800 --> 11:46.290
then so be it.

11:46.330 --> 11:49.060
We're all doing things
folks thought we couldn't do.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.034
- We defy the odds.
- Mm, say that.

11:51.070 --> 11:53.072
- Defy? ( laughs )
- Yes, ma'am.

11:53.110 --> 11:55.499
Statistics say
you can't make partner.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.940
You can't have
your own busmess.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.073
You shouldn't have a PhD.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.089
- A what?
A-but you do.
- I do.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.317
Now you gotta carry
that black girl magic
into your love life.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.352
Listen now, come on.
Come on.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.881
Think of
the other possibilities
other than brothers.

12:10.930 --> 12:14.127
- Like date a Latino man.
- Okay, Latin lover.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.799
- Or white women.
- Uh-- okay.

12:16.830 --> 12:21.039
- Or other sisters._
- Okay, everybody ain't
as adventurous as you, Nova.

12:21.070 --> 12:24.335
- Too far.
- Y'all so dead set
on finding a brother,

12:24.370 --> 12:26.770
why not come out
to the community bail
fundraiser

12:26.810 --> 12:28.107
I'm hosting this week?

12:28.140 --> 12:30.802
- Okay.
- You never know.

12:30.850 --> 12:34.377
You might just find
a Barry you can spit-shine
into a Barack.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.773
( laughter )

12:35.820 --> 12:38.141
Okay, now,
I'm about that one.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.511
- Yeah.
- I about that one.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.516
( cranking )

12:42.560 --> 12:44.357
It was working just fine
this morning.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.858
Yeah, it's old.
It's bound to happen.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.357
Know anybody
who could fix it cheap?

12:51.100 --> 12:54.263
Look, I just wanna fix
this up fast, Mr. Prosper.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.837
If I don't finish getting
that land ready this weekend,

12:56.870 --> 12:58.929
I'll miss out on having
soybeans this harvest.

12:58.970 --> 13:00.437
They gonna bring in
extra money.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.471
I got it all
figured out.

13:02.510 --> 13:05.399
- So, yeah.
- Soybean, huh?

13:05.450 --> 13:07.918
Yeah.

13:07.950 --> 13:10.145
You know,
that's a good idea,
Ralph Angel.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.282
Real good.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.289
Yeah, new ideas, man.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.185
Ernest would be proud.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.221
Thank you, Mr. Prosper.

13:20.260 --> 13:23.161
Yeah.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.260
( phone rings )

13:26.300 --> 13:28.791
- It's Wood.
Excuse me.
- ( chuckles )

13:31.270 --> 13:34.398
Wood! What you say?
What you say?

13:34.440 --> 13:37.045
Just working, you know?

13:37.080 --> 13:39.002
What's going on
with you, man?
How's Blue?

13:39.050 --> 13:41.041
He good.
How you doing?

13:41.080 --> 13:42.570
Y'all doing
the Juneteen dinner?

13:42.620 --> 13:44.588
Yes, sir, like always.

13:44.620 --> 13:46.850
Except Darla gonna
be there this year.

13:46.890 --> 13:49.154
Oh-ho!
Y'all back for true, huh?

13:49.190 --> 13:50.418
Yeah.

13:50.460 --> 13:51.927
Things been good.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.598
Good for you, man.

13:53.630 --> 13:56.053
You deserve it.

13:56.100 --> 13:59.866
How's Charley and Nova,
the harvest?

13:59.900 --> 14:01.936
The harvest, Wood?

14:01.970 --> 14:03.938
What, you gonna ask
about the porch, too?

14:03.970 --> 14:05.506
Come on,
what's on your mind?

14:05.540 --> 14:08.429
I-- I missed
a call from Vi.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.505
Any idea what it's about?
She okay?

14:10.550 --> 14:13.371
Oh, see, I ain't getting
caught in that trick bag again.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.411
I learned that lesson
the hard way.

14:15.450 --> 14:18.544
Look, Wood, you wanna know
how Vi doing,

14:18.590 --> 14:20.217
you need to ask her.

14:22.490 --> 14:28.019
- ( music playing )
- I mean, he doesn't
return my voicemail.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.891
And he ain't even
posting on Facebook.

14:29.930 --> 14:32.364
- It's like he just
forgot about me.
- Impossible.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.038
He might be
trying to forget,

14:34.070 --> 14:37.631
but you, lady,
you are unforgettable.

14:37.670 --> 14:42.278
- And you
are unforgettable.
- Thank you!

14:42.310 --> 14:45.905
And we are here!
And we are beautiful!

14:45.950 --> 14:47.542
And we are about
to go dance!

14:47.580 --> 14:49.116
- Oh. Oh--
- Like now.

14:49.150 --> 14:52.586
- Mm, okay.
- Get up! Come on, up!

14:52.620 --> 14:55.509
Aunt Vi, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.425
* Kill them all
and then I peel off
in the Mustang *

14:57.460 --> 14:59.382
*_-- ain't -- _
but a t0ilet bowl stain *

14:59.430 --> 15:01.489
* Death to the label,
disappointing y'all lames *

15:01.530 --> 15:03.395
* -- an AK, I'll probably
stick a fork in your brains *

15:03.430 --> 15:05.489
* Excuse me, --,
while I powder my nose *

15:05.530 --> 15:07.896
( song continues )

15:15.480 --> 15:16.435
Boo.

15:34.730 --> 15:36.425
( indistinct chatter )

15:36.460 --> 15:40.237
* I'm like wherever,
however, whatever *

15:40.270 --> 15:42.192
* We like whatever...

15:45.440 --> 15:47.374
( music playing )

15:52.250 --> 15:54.548
What do you think
you're doing?

15:56.350 --> 15:57.419
What?

15:59.420 --> 16:02.253
You know, I don't know
what upsets me more,

16:02.290 --> 16:05.327
the fact that
you're with... this

16:05.360 --> 16:08.625
instead of with your son
on his birthday

16:08.660 --> 16:10.196
like you're supposed to be

16:10.230 --> 16:13.290
or that you're with this
in public

16:13.340 --> 16:17.106
when we have worked so hard
to control the press

16:17.140 --> 16:18.300
about our situation.

16:18.340 --> 16:22.379
First of all,
our son is 16,

16:22.410 --> 16:24.446
and he wanted to hang
with his girlfriend.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.210
He blew me off.

16:27.250 --> 16:30.686
Second, come on, Charley,
give me some credit, okay?

16:30.720 --> 16:32.449
I mean, look around.

16:32.490 --> 16:35.209
Do you see any phones
or cameras pointed at us?

16:37.160 --> 16:38.752
They know me here.
They got my back.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.725
Who do you think
you're talking to, huh?

16:41.760 --> 16:44.490
After all that Charley
has done for you,

16:44.530 --> 16:46.191
how she protected you,

16:46.230 --> 16:48.494
you ought to be ashamed
of yourself,

16:48.540 --> 16:51.759
parading around
with some little
lowlife hussy,

16:51.810 --> 16:53.698
barely out of Pampers!

16:53.740 --> 16:55.628
Don't. Don't.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.375
Everything okay,
Mr. West?

16:57.410 --> 17:00.379
Everything is just fine
if you would just get
outta my face,

17:00.420 --> 17:01.773
if you know
what's good for you!

17:01.820 --> 17:03.219
I think you've
had enough, ma'am.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.047
Oh, I have had enough!

17:05.090 --> 17:06.819
Of you,
thank you very much!

17:06.850 --> 17:08.659
- I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.
- Oh, you did not touch me!

17:08.690 --> 17:11.352
Don't touch me!
You don't know me well enough!

17:11.390 --> 17:14.393
- Let me walk you out.
- You should be ashamed
of yourself!

17:14.430 --> 17:16.091
- That's what I say!
- Don't. Stop!

17:16.130 --> 17:18.189
Violet:
That's what I say!

17:24.110 --> 17:26.533
How do you look yourself
in the mirror?

17:34.850 --> 17:37.444
(TV playing
in background )

17:39.890 --> 17:42.211
You wanna talk
about it?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.822
We used to sit
and talk for hours

17:49.860 --> 17:51.589
when he first got drafted.

17:54.400 --> 17:58.166
He'd come back
from an away game...

17:58.210 --> 18:02.476
tell me everything,
like a book report.

18:06.580 --> 18:10.118
And I'd sit on the couch
with my back against him.

18:13.220 --> 18:15.518
Our chests rising
and falling together.

18:20.230 --> 18:22.653
I felt_ so safe
in his arms.

18:25.830 --> 18:28.230
Like nothing
could touch me.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.139
And to see him put his arm
around that girl...

18:46.550 --> 18:48.654
Why can't we get it
together?

18:50.860 --> 18:53.499
Even Hollywood and Vi
didn't last.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.252
I know.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.892
Ithought
they were forever.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.534
( sighs )

19:02.670 --> 19:04.137
Me, too.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.309
( sighs )

19:16.680 --> 19:19.444
Marlene:
It's good to see
so many faces today.

19:19.490 --> 19:22.550
Okay, so who would like
to kick us off?

19:25.430 --> 19:27.489
I will.

19:27.530 --> 19:29.521
Um...

19:29.560 --> 19:33.633
I, um...
haven't been here
for a while,

19:33.670 --> 19:37.458
because deep down, I was
hoping I wouldn't need to.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.832
Once dependent,
always dependent.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.279
When, um--

19:42.310 --> 19:45.871
when I was a little girl,
I had this T-shirt

19:45.910 --> 19:49.414
with a little ballerina
on it.

19:49.450 --> 19:52.339
I loved it because
she had a tiara

19:52.390 --> 19:53.857
with a rhinestone

19:53.890 --> 19:57.883
and a tiny pink tutu
made of tulle.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.659
( laughs )

19:59.690 --> 20:01.851
I...

20:01.900 --> 20:04.323
God, I wore it
everywhere.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.429
Drove my mother crazy.

20:06.470 --> 20:09.234
She was always washing it.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.761
And then...

20:14.440 --> 20:17.273
one day, I spilled
cranberry juice on it.

20:18.650 --> 20:23.349
My mom, she scrubbed it,
she soaked it,

20:23.390 --> 20:26.541
she even squeezed
lemon juice on it.

20:28.590 --> 20:30.683
Still, she couldn't get
that stain out.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.729
I've--

20:36.760 --> 20:40.696
I've been spending
a lot of time with...

20:40.740 --> 20:42.264
my son and his father.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.564
It's been...

20:44.610 --> 20:47.272
amazing.

20:47.310 --> 20:50.404
It has been
rhinestones and tutus.

20:51.480 --> 20:55.439
But there's this
family dinner today,

20:55.480 --> 20:56.777
and I don't wanna go.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.242
Because...

21:01.790 --> 21:05.487
even though I'm just
a couple months shy

21:05.530 --> 21:07.657
of my two-year
anniversary...

21:14.800 --> 21:17.735
I'm afraid that all
I'll see is that stain.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.274
Thank you
for letting me share.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.842
Thank you.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.957
Okay, who's next?

21:34.990 --> 21:38.983
Micah, you and that fancy car
of yours better be on your way.

21:39.030 --> 21:42.022
Leave that boy be.
He's 16.

21:42.060 --> 21:44.392
He's supposed to be
joyriding.

21:44.430 --> 21:47.399
- Ah! _
- Aunt Vi!

21:47.440 --> 21:50.466
Hey, baby.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.068
Mwah!
How's my favorite person?

21:52.110 --> 21:55.671
- Where's your mama?
- She's coming after work.

21:55.710 --> 21:57.701
( whispers )
Did you make me a pie?

21:57.750 --> 22:00.446
Of course I did.
Your favorite.

22:00.480 --> 22:01.879
- Blueberry?
- Yes!

22:01.920 --> 22:04.946
( laughs )
It's already in there
on the counter, cut.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.084
- Go get a piece.
- Wait, wait. Dessert
before dinner, Aunt Vi?

22:08.120 --> 22:10.054
Lord, this is Freedom Day.

22:10.090 --> 22:11.978
Y'all let these boys
be free!

22:12.030 --> 22:14.726
- I ain't saying nothing.
- How are things at the farm?

22:14.760 --> 22:16.955
- Things good.
- I've been meaning
to swing by.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.661
We good.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.964
I should say
till the tractor
broke down yesterday.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.969
- What happened?
- I was tilling some
fallow acres for soybeans.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.329
Soybeans?

22:26.740 --> 22:28.935
Wait, you know
about this?

22:28.980 --> 22:30.607
No.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.005
We're partners, Ralph Angel.
We've talked about this.

22:33.050 --> 22:34.847
You can't just make
unilateral decisions.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.747
I figure we might as well
make some money on that land.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.712
Ithought
you liked money,
Charley.

22:39.750 --> 22:41.149
Nova:
Well, now that we know,

22:41.190 --> 22:43.522
what do we do
about the tractor?

22:43.560 --> 22:45.482
Look, I know you're
sentimental about it

22:45.530 --> 22:46.986
because it belonged
to Daddy,

22:47.030 --> 22:48.622
_ but we should
just buy a new one.

22:49.900 --> 22:52.391
That costs $15,000.

22:52.430 --> 22:54.694
- And repairing this one?
- Normally 6.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.492
But the mechanic
only charged me 5

22:56.540 --> 22:58.565
since I did
some of the work myself.

22:58.610 --> 23:01.977
So it seems like
your fast thinking
paid off.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.546
Nova:
For us all.

23:03.580 --> 23:06.003
Ralph Angel:
I guess so.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.847
I get it.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.678
We're all happy
Rah saved some money.

23:10.720 --> 23:14.588
But just to be clear--
if we had gotten a new tractor,

23:14.620 --> 23:16.178
we could write off
the depreCIation

23:16.220 --> 23:18.552
_and save more
in the long run.

23:18.590 --> 23:21.024
Fixing an old tractor
that's outlived its value

23:21.060 --> 23:23.927
is like stepping over a dollar
to pick up a dime.

23:25.870 --> 23:28.634
How much longer
until Mommy comes?

23:28.670 --> 23:31.400
Soon.
Let's go get washed up.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.174
* My flow like a ponytail

23:36.210 --> 23:39.577
* So when I spit on a skinhead,
he becomes a Hare Krishna *

23:39.610 --> 23:42.044
- * Keep up with your feet
or get them blisters... *
- ( siren wails)

23:42.080 --> 23:44.719
* Like you're on
the Tawaf by the Kaaba,
that's the mission *

23:44.750 --> 23:46.684
* Yo, call the feds,
call the papers *

23:46.720 --> 23:48.608
* My youth's gone missing,
he's gone Iraq *

23:48.660 --> 23:50.218
* He's gone to Syria,
he didn't listen *

23:50.260 --> 23:52.922
* You got your mom in tears
in Sajda, Quran kissing *

23:52.960 --> 23:55.758
* The politicians at the mic
all bayaan giving *

23:55.800 --> 23:58.189
* I pray for my nephew,
I pray you're not antagonized *

23:58.230 --> 24:00.960
* By all the hating
and news and the shit
they sanitize *

24:01.000 --> 24:03.537
* Look, Zayn Malik's got
more than eighty virgins
on him *

24:03.570 --> 24:06.698
* There's more than
one direction to get
to paradise... *

24:06.740 --> 24:10.540
- ( beeping )
- Officer on P.A.:
Turn off your engine.

24:10.580 --> 24:11.808
( music stops )

24:22.060 --> 24:26.258
( ringtone playing )

24:26.290 --> 24:27.791
( ringtone stops )

24:28.730 --> 24:30.994
( police radio chatter)

24:39.610 --> 24:40.702
( knock on window )

24:40.740 --> 24:41.809
Roll down the window.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.705
I gotta turn the car
back on first.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.605
Roll down the window!

24:50.120 --> 24:52.179
( engine starts )

24:54.560 --> 24:57.256
Hey, I wasn't-- I wasn't
speeding or anything, right?

24:57.290 --> 24:59.588
You mind telling me
what this is all about?

24:59.630 --> 25:00.892
You live out here?

25:00.930 --> 25:03.296
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I guess.

25:03.330 --> 25:05.719
You guess?

25:05.770 --> 25:06.998
New car?

25:07.030 --> 25:08.793
Yes, sir,
a birthday present.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.489
Let me see your license.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.807
You know what,
I think--

25:17.850 --> 25:19.977
I thinkI left it
back at home.

25:20.010 --> 25:22.012
Not this home,
the one in New Orleans.

25:22.050 --> 25:24.780
Let_ me see
your registration, now.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.157
Get out of the car!

25:31.190 --> 25:33.954
Put your hands up
where I can see them!

25:34.000 --> 25:36.093
Get out of the car now!

25:39.300 --> 25:42.838
You see what you want to see,
but the rest of us?

25:42.870 --> 25:45.862
We see Ralph Angel
busting his butt

25:45.910 --> 25:47.832
trying to make
this farm work.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.972
So am I.

25:49.010 --> 25:51.046
I know that, baby.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.742
But you got multiple degrees
behind your name

25:53.780 --> 25:57.113
proving what you already know,
that you can do this.

25:57.150 --> 25:59.983
So all I'm saying is
it wouldn't hurt

26:00.020 --> 26:02.784
to affirm it _
every now and again.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.789
"Thank you, yes.
Good job."

26:05.830 --> 26:07.798
Instead of keeping him
under your thumb.

26:07.830 --> 26:10.128
No, that-- that's not
what I'm doing.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.128
Trust me, I know exactly
what it feels like

26:12.170 --> 26:14.092
to be under
someone's thumb.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.266
What are you
talking about?

26:15.300 --> 26:16.699
Charley:
Those Wall Street guys,

26:16.740 --> 26:19.334
they won't give me
the loan for the mill

26:19.370 --> 26:21.600
unless Davi_s
Signs off on it.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.700
Oh, hell, I wish I had
known that last night.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.308
Just ask Davis to do you
this last favor.

26:26.350 --> 26:27.817
He owes you that much.

26:27.850 --> 26:31.047
- Mama!
- Hi!

26:31.090 --> 26:35.982
I'm sorry I'm late.
My NA meeting ran over.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.682
- ( mouths words )
- Violet: Well, we're just
happy you're here, baby.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.152
( chuckles )

26:42.730 --> 26:45.665
Come on,
let me talk to you
outside for a second.

26:53.170 --> 26:55.377
I really am sorry
I'm late.

26:55.410 --> 26:57.640
I-- it's been a while
since I talked to Marlene.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.399
- And I had a lot on my--
- Marlene?

27:00.450 --> 27:02.714
My sponsor.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.342
You still need all that?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.950
Sponsors? Meetings?

27:06.990 --> 27:09.686
What, you're not
slipping back,
are you?

27:09.720 --> 27:12.223
I'm trying
to make sure I don't.

27:12.260 --> 27:14.023
By hanging out
with other addicts

27:14.060 --> 27:15.698
talking about
when you was using.

27:15.730 --> 27:18.767
I'm working my steps
to stay clean.

27:20.030 --> 27:21.292
I mean, don't all
that looking back

27:21.340 --> 27:23.092
make it hard
to put behind you?

27:23.140 --> 27:25.199
( sighs )

27:25.240 --> 27:26.730
I want Charley
to take me serious.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.000
I don't talk about
when I was inside.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.405
It's different, though.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.874
You went in
for something you did.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.014
This is who I am.

27:35.050 --> 27:39.316
It'll never
be behind me,
Ralph Angel.

27:40.790 --> 27:43.315
There's no cure
for my disease.

27:45.060 --> 27:47.858
The meetings, my sponsor?

27:47.900 --> 27:49.424
They help.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.190
It's too much for anyone
to do alone.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.232
Hey.

28:00.270 --> 28:02.272
You ain't
gotta do it alone.

28:06.150 --> 28:08.015
Violet: Okay.

28:08.050 --> 28:10.780
Oh, baby, no, you sit here
in your daddy's old seat.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.243
Darla, you sit next to him.
( clears throat )

28:13.290 --> 28:16.453
And are we waiting
for our little joyrider?

28:16.490 --> 28:18.355
- No.
- ( laughs ) Okay.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.362
Violet:
All right.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.236
Blue, close your eyes.

28:29.270 --> 28:32.728
( sighs )
Thank You, Lord,

28:32.770 --> 28:35.079
from each
and every one of us
at this table,

28:35.110 --> 28:37.408
for without Your love,
without Your guidance...

28:37.440 --> 28:39.943
- ( phone buzzing )
- ...and Your protection,

28:39.980 --> 28:41.971
we might not be here today.

28:43.520 --> 28:47.411
We ask that Your blessing
over this food

28:47.450 --> 28:50.317
will nourish our bodies

28:50.360 --> 28:52.954
and we ask that
You nourish our souls

28:52.990 --> 28:57.222
and make us strong to carry on
this Juneteen tradition

28:57.260 --> 29:00.195
without our beloved Ernest,

29:00.230 --> 29:04.109
father, brother,
grandfather.

29:04.140 --> 29:06.301
- Amen.
- All: Amen.

29:09.010 --> 29:10.432
I miss Papa.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.745
Me, too, baby,
every day.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.980
( phone buzzing )

29:18.020 --> 29:19.783
Excuse me, all.

29:21.190 --> 29:22.851
- Violet: Okay, dig in.
- Hello?

29:22.890 --> 29:26.189
What's up with everybody
ignoring my phone calls?

29:26.230 --> 29:28.198
Can you put Micah on, please?
He won't pick up.

29:28.230 --> 29:31.393
I'm not ignoring your calls.
We're in the middle of dinner.

29:31.430 --> 29:34.194
I'll have Micah call as soon
as he gets here, okay?

29:34.240 --> 29:37.129
- Charley, he left
my place hours ago.
- Maybe he's with Keke.

29:37.170 --> 29:40.503
I'll call her,
and I'll call you back.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.428
- Well, now, he...
- ( clicks )

29:46.450 --> 29:49.044
Charley:
Yeah. Okay.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.479
Yeah, thank you, Keke.

29:50.520 --> 29:54.012
Can you call me
if you hear from him?

29:54.060 --> 29:56.858
- Violet: Don't use
your hands, baby.
- ( chattering )

30:01.600 --> 30:03.397
Micah should have
been here by now.

30:04.630 --> 30:07.292
And he's not with Keke.
Ijust tried calling him.

30:07.330 --> 30:10.390
There's only so many routes
from New Orleans to St. Jo.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.068
Maybe he ran out of gas
and his phone died.

30:20.450 --> 30:23.271
( line rings
on speakerphone )

30:23.320 --> 30:26.039
( softly)
Oh, come on.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.081
Come on, pick up.

30:33.330 --> 30:34.524
Hollywood: Vi.

30:38.030 --> 30:39.566
Holleood.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.328
What's wrong?

30:46.240 --> 30:47.935
Ijust, um...

30:47.980 --> 30:50.574
really needed to hear
your voice right about now.

30:52.950 --> 30:54.372
Well, I'm here.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.341
What is it, chre?

30:58.390 --> 30:59.982
It's Micah.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.087
We can't find him.

31:03.120 --> 31:06.123
It's going on
several hours now.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.048
I'm so worried.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.227
Probably just out
with his friends.

31:10.260 --> 31:12.967
You know how these kids are
when they get caught up.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.389
- He's still chasing
after Keke?
- Yeah.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.204
Ain't no telling
what they doing.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.468
Yeah, that boy just fine.

31:19.510 --> 31:21.375
( laughs )

31:21.410 --> 31:23.071
( sniffles )

31:23.110 --> 31:26.898
Just hearing you say that
makes me feel so much better.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.618
Uh, I'm so glad
you picked up.

31:30.650 --> 31:33.414
I didn't know
if you would.

31:35.690 --> 31:39.148
Things didn't end right
between us, Hollywood.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.165
I wanna see you.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.094
Me too, baby.

31:49.140 --> 31:50.459
Me, too.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.115
I don't have servic_e.
D-do you have serwce?

32:06.150 --> 32:07.515
Yeah.

32:09.590 --> 32:12.650
( ringtone playing )

32:17.230 --> 32:18.993
Micah?!

32:19.030 --> 32:22.261
- ( phone ringing )
- Micah!

32:22.300 --> 32:23.494
Hello?

32:24.610 --> 32:26.566
- Yes.
- What?

32:26.610 --> 32:29.579
- Oh, my God, thank you.
- They found Micah?

32:29.610 --> 32:32.044
Okay.
Thank you.

32:34.180 --> 32:37.570
( men shouting )

32:37.620 --> 32:41.181
( door buzzes )

32:44.630 --> 32:46.052
He's all yours.

32:55.270 --> 32:57.158
Excuse-- excuse me?

32:57.200 --> 32:59.168
Can I make
a phone call,
please?

32:59.210 --> 33:00.768
Sure.
Just gotta
wait your turn.

33:00.810 --> 33:03.199
There are about 400 others
in front of you.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.719
( door buzzes )

33:22.430 --> 33:23.749
( lock clicks )

33:46.150 --> 33:48.289
You have my son
in custody-- Micah West.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.049
I need to see him
right now.

33:50.090 --> 33:52.524
We were told
that her son,
my nephew,

33:52.560 --> 33:54.221
was arrested
and brought here.

33:54.260 --> 33:55.796
Do you mind
checking the system

33:55.830 --> 33:57.491
just to see
if it's correct?

33:57.530 --> 33:59.293
His name's Micah West.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.265
I'll take a look.

34:02.300 --> 34:06.134
( typing )

34:06.170 --> 34:09.378
- No Micah West in the system.
- There must be some mistake.

34:09.410 --> 34:12.345
- Hey, what's going on?
Where is he?
- I don't know. I don't know.

34:12.380 --> 34:16.214
- Somebody just better give me
some answers real quick!
- Listen. Charley, calm down.

34:19.150 --> 34:22.688
Hey, hey, Charley?

34:24.130 --> 34:25.620
Let me handle this, okay?

34:29.730 --> 34:31.266
Hey.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.825
- Officer Newsome, is it?
- Yes.

34:33.870 --> 34:35.838
And can I just say
on behalf of everyone,

34:35.870 --> 34:38.430
we're all hoping
you get that fifth ring
for the Stingers, Mr. West.

34:38.470 --> 34:39.801
Thanks, man.
Me, too. Me, too.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.571
Hey, listen, I'm looking
for my son-- Micah.

34:43.610 --> 34:45.248
We were told
he's in custody here.

34:45.280 --> 34:49.376
He's about 5'9", brown eyes,
dark brown hair.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.741
I've been told
he looks a lot like me.

34:53.790 --> 34:56.156
I'm sorry,
but I checked the system.

34:56.190 --> 34:59.489
- We don't have him.
- Okay, all right, listen.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.452
You mind checking
the holding cells?

35:01.500 --> 35:03.559
You know,
just to be sure.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.693
- Be happy to, Mr. West.
- Thank you.

35:05.730 --> 35:06.662
Go ahead.

35:09.240 --> 35:10.764
( door buzzes )

35:10.800 --> 35:14.429
- ( whispering )
Get your selfie.
- Yeah, I know.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.778
Hey, do you think
I could get a quick selfie?

35:26.920 --> 35:28.182
( clicks )

35:28.220 --> 35:29.687
Thank you.

35:33.490 --> 35:34.627
- Mom.
' ( gasps )

35:34.660 --> 35:35.888
Micah.

35:35.930 --> 35:37.488
Micah.

35:39.270 --> 35:40.419
( sighs )

35:42.800 --> 35:44.631
( sighs )

35:44.670 --> 35:46.228
You okay?

35:46.270 --> 35:47.669
You okay?

35:52.950 --> 35:54.918
I know
you must be tired.

36:13.570 --> 36:15.595
Ain't nothing
to be ashamed of.

36:26.680 --> 36:29.843
- Davis: I know you're not
trying to blame me for this.
- Charley: This is your fault.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.883
Micah never would have been
pulled over if you hadn't
bought him that car!

36:32.920 --> 36:36.253
He's my son.
It was a present, okay?

36:36.290 --> 36:38.724
Charley,
we can't protect him
from everything.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.695
- These things happen.
- These things?

36:41.730 --> 36:43.789
He was arrested
for driving while black,

36:43.830 --> 36:45.559
and then you go
and you make it worse

36:45.600 --> 36:47.420
with your
Stepin Fetchit act!

36:49.800 --> 36:51.939
You know what _
your damn problem is?

36:51.970 --> 36:55.929
You can't _stand that
for once-- just once--

36:55.980 --> 36:59.871
you don't have control,
that you don't have
the answers.

36:59.910 --> 37:02.515
Yeah, I have may have danced
for those white boys
in there, okay?

37:02.550 --> 37:04.415
But it was my damn dance!

37:04.450 --> 37:05.986
I'm the reason he's free.

37:06.020 --> 37:08.386
Hey, Micah.

37:08.420 --> 37:10.786
( thunder rumbles )

37:29.510 --> 37:30.909
Davis:
Look”.

37:36.550 --> 37:38.438
you're gonna be all right.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.287
You hear me?

37:41.320 --> 37:42.958
Listen, hey, look at me.

37:42.990 --> 37:44.878
Look.

37:44.930 --> 37:48.821
Whatever went down,
whatever happened in there,

37:48.860 --> 37:51.499
we're gonna
get through this together.

37:53.930 --> 37:55.534
Come here.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.506
Did Charley say
how Micah's doing?

38:07.550 --> 38:08.869
Didn't have to.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.809
He been in jail.
Ain't no way he doing good.

38:13.090 --> 38:15.979
You okay?

38:16.020 --> 38:17.658
I'm fine.

38:19.930 --> 38:22.524
I'll go get Blue.
I'll see you at the house.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.528
I can't.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.959
What, you gotta
work early?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.366
No, it's, um...

38:29.400 --> 38:31.504
What?

38:31.540 --> 38:34.031
It-- it just feels
like all of this

38:34.070 --> 38:36.573
has been moving
really, really fast.

38:37.780 --> 38:39.543
Fast?

38:39.580 --> 38:41.377
( chuckles softly)

38:41.420 --> 38:44.947
I mean, it took us a long time
to get to a place that's good.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.014
I've--

38:46.050 --> 38:51.078
I've been wanting this
so badly for so long...

38:52.760 --> 38:55.024
that I let us skip
a bunch of steps.

38:56.730 --> 38:59.790
And I can't
play house anymore.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.795
It's dangerous.

39:04.940 --> 39:06.635
At least for me.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.070
You're breaking up with me?

39:12.950 --> 39:14.747
I don't think so.

39:19.750 --> 39:22.014
We need to be able
to stand on our own

39:22.060 --> 39:25.723
before we move forward
together.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.421
Do you understand?

39:27.460 --> 39:29.121
As long as we not
breaking up.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.720
We're not breaking up.

39:31.770 --> 39:34.762
We're just
slowing it down.
( sniffles )

39:40.040 --> 39:42.770
- ( bell tolling )
- * Pray

39:45.480 --> 39:48.847
* Pray for me

39:51.790 --> 39:54.918

on my own *

39:54.960 --> 39:57.679
* Need to find

40:04.830 --> 40:07.025
- * Pray

40:07.070 --> 40:09.766

40:09.800 --> 40:12.439
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

40:12.470 --> 40:14.836
When's Mommy coming over?

40:14.880 --> 40:15.972

40:16.010 --> 40:19.639
* 'Cause the _wolves

40:19.680 --> 40:21.170
* Won't go down

40:21.210 --> 40:23.770
- Gonna make

- Um...

40:23.820 --> 40:25.515
- Huh?
- Don't do it!
I'm ticklish!

40:25.550 --> 40:28.144
-(laughs)
- I knew you was
coming for that!

40:29.560 --> 40:31.687
( music playing )

40:39.230 --> 40:41.164
( bell continues tolling )

40:52.710 --> 40:55.144
* Oh, pray

40:55.180 --> 40:56.772
* Pray

40:56.820 --> 40:58.685
* Pray...

40:58.720 --> 41:01.211
- You should go.
- * Pray for me

41:01.250 --> 41:05.129
* Pra-a-y

41:05.160 --> 41:08.789
* Now you've got me
on my knees *

41:08.830 --> 41:11.219
* Holding out
for sympathy *

41:11.260 --> 41:13.694
* So pray

41:13.730 --> 41:15.038
* Pray...

41:15.070 --> 41:17.937
( door opens,
knock on door )

41:19.670 --> 41:21.069
Charley: Hi.

41:22.980 --> 41:26.848
Just, um--
just checking in on you.

41:32.150 --> 41:34.983
You wanna talk about
what happened yesterday?

41:35.020 --> 41:37.159
No.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.579
* Found the strength,
the strength *

41:39.630 --> 41:42.724
* I will have
my day... *

41:42.760 --> 41:45.820
- Okay.
- * Pray

41:48.030 --> 41:52.000
- * Pray for me...
- ( door closes )

41:55.010 --> 41:58.104
* Yeah, the wolves
are out tonight *

41:58.140 --> 42:02.839
* Won't go down
without a fight, so... *

42:04.650 --> 42:07.039
* Pray

42:09.660 --> 42:13.187
* Pray for me

42:15.930 --> 42:19.161
* 'Cause I'm out here
on my own *

42:19.200 --> 42:22.135
* Need to find my way
back home *

42:22.170 --> 42:25.059
* So, pray

42:30.680 --> 42:33.843
* Pra-a-y

42:36.820 --> 42:40.210
* Pra-a-y

42:47.930 --> 42:53.163
* Pray, pray, pray.
