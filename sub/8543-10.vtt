09:50.633 --> 09:51.721
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

09:51.765 --> 09:53.027
CARSON.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.551
WHAT ARE YOU PROTECTING
JEREMY FROM, CARSON?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.335
HE'S DEAD.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.514
OKAY.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.691
LIKE, SIX MONTHS BACK...MM-HMM.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.127
MY CAR WAS JACKED UP
IN AN ACCIDENT.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.085
JEREMY GAVE ME MONEY
TO FIX IT.

10:08.129 --> 10:09.434
8 G's.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.959
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.917
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.572
YOU THINK HE WAS DEALING
THE MARIJUANA ON THE SIDE?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.269
HEY, I ASKED HIM.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.054
HE SAID, "HELL NO."

10:20.097 --> 10:22.012
I DIDN'T CARE.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.756
BUT IF MATTHEW FOUND OUT,

10:26.800 --> 10:27.757
HE'D KILL HIM.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.759
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.761
THANK YOU, CARSON.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.937
YOU NEED SOME MORE EYE DROPS.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.678
JUST MAYBE A BREATH MINT.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.465
SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.554
NO BIG-TICKET ITEMS
ON JEREMY'S CREDIT CARD.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.469
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT JANE'S TALKING ABOUT.

10:44.513 --> 10:45.993
KID LIVED CHEAP.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.647
YEAH, BUT IF YOU LOOK
AT HIS BANK ACCOUNTS,

10:47.690 --> 10:49.039
PLAIN VANILLA.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.824
THEN EIGHT MONTHS AGO,
HE OPENS A SAVINGS ACCOUNT,

10:50.867 --> 10:52.608
AND HE GETS ONCE-MONTHLY
DIRECT DEPOSITS

10:52.652 --> 10:54.131
FROM SOME COMPANY
IN THE CAYMANS.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.132
10 GRAND A POP.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.091
SHADY.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.701
'SUP, LADIES?

10:58.745 --> 10:59.963
HEY.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.139
GANG UNIT HAS A TIP
ON A COUNTERFEITING RING

11:02.183 --> 11:04.098
RUNNING OUT OF A GARAGE
ON WEST CAPITOL.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.622
RAPID RESPONSE TEAM
IS UP FOR THE BUST.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.971
NICE. NOW?

11:08.015 --> 11:09.886
ROLL CALL IN 30.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.671
I SQUARED IT
WITH YOUR CUTE BOSS.

11:11.714 --> 11:12.976
I'M IN.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.761
UH, WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.415
I'LL HAVE HIM BACK
IN A FEW HOURS, DAD.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.504
LOOK, IF YOU'RE
THE RAPID RESPONSE TEAM,

11:19.548 --> 11:20.984
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
SLIDING DOWN FIRE POLES,

11:21.028 --> 11:23.204
NOT HANGING AROUND HERE
FOR 30 MINUTES?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.905
SO JEREMY WAS MAKING MONEY
ON THE SIDE.

11:28.949 --> 11:31.647
MORE THAN HE WAS MAKING
AT WESTERLY ORGANICS.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.867
MAYBE THAT'S THE BOSS
HE WAS FIGHTING WITH.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.130
EXCEPT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHO WAS PAYING HIM.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.915
A COMPANY IN ROMANIA THAT WAS
INCORPORATED IN THE CAYMANS.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.221
KEEP DIGGING.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.049
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT WAS IN THAT SAFE.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.485
UH, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT WAS, DRUGS?

11:43.528 --> 11:45.095
HE HAD TOO MUCH RESPECT
FOR HIS WORK

11:45.139 --> 11:47.054
TO SELL IT IN ZIPLOC BAGGIES.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.446
WELL, IT WASN'T CASH.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.187
ALL THE MONEY DEPOSITED IN HIS
ACCOUNT'S STILL THERE,

11:50.231 --> 11:51.188
EXCEPT FOR 8 GRAND.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.799
WHICH HE GAVE TO HIS FRIEND.

11:52.842 --> 11:53.930
PRELIMINARY FORENSICS REPORT

11:53.974 --> 11:55.105
PUTS THE TIME OF DEATH
AROUND 6:00 A.M.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.673
NO ONE HAD SEEN JEREMY
FOR 12 HOURS.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.414
MAYBE HE WAS MOONLIGHTING.

11:59.457 --> 12:00.763
MIGHT EXPLAIN THOSE DEPOSITS.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.199
JANE? THOUGHTS?

12:02.243 --> 12:04.158
I'M PUZZLED.THAT'S EVIDENCE.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.855
I WANT YOU TO GET IT
TO TECHNICAL SERVICES

12:05.899 --> 12:07.727
AND HAVE IT OPENED,
ON MY DESK IN THE MORNING.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.163
ARE WE GOOD?

12:09.206 --> 12:11.861
YOU SEEM A LITTLE OBSESSED
WITH EVALUATING OUR STATUS.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.689
IS IT GOOD, BAD...

12:13.733 --> 12:14.690
I MEAN, WE'RE ALIVE.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.040
THE GUY THAT MADE THIS
IS DEAD.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.216
BY COMPARISON, I THINK
WE'RE DOING VERY WELL.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.827
TOMORROW MORNING.

12:26.789 --> 12:30.227
[whirring]

12:33.491 --> 12:37.452

UH, HANDS IN THE AIR,

14:49.758 --> 14:52.456
OR--OR DOWN ON THE GROUND?
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

15:00.377 --> 15:01.335
[door closes]

15:01.378 --> 15:02.640
A TOBACCO LABORATORY?

15:02.684 --> 15:03.946
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT IT WAS.

15:03.990 --> 15:04.947
OH, SO YOU JUST BROKE IN?

15:04.991 --> 15:06.949
UH... EH...

15:06.993 --> 15:08.342
I LEFT YOU A VOICEMAIL.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.213
HOW DID YOU GET
THE BOX OPEN?

15:10.257 --> 15:11.649
UH... HEH.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.825
FRANCESCA EHRLICH
WITH JG ALLEN TOBACCO.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.263
THIS IS STUART DAVIS,
MY BOSS.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.047
AH. PATRICK JANE, CONSULTANT.

15:18.091 --> 15:19.962
THIS, UH, ISN'T MY BOSS.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.183
I AM TERESA LISBON,
AND I AM HIS BOSS.

15:23.226 --> 15:24.836
SO YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR MR. JANE

15:24.880 --> 15:28.231
COMPROMISING A TOP-SECRET
RESEARCH FACILITY?

15:28.275 --> 15:30.407
JEREMY HAD A KEY.
WHAT WAS HE DOING WITH A KEY

15:30.451 --> 15:31.756
TO A TOBACCO LABORATORY?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.497
WELL, JEREMY IS...

15:33.541 --> 15:36.022

A FREELANCE BOTANIST.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.937
HE WORKED NIGHTS
AND WEEKENDS FOR US

15:37.980 --> 15:39.590
ABOUT NINE MONTHS?

15:39.634 --> 15:40.591
YEAH.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.028
AND WHAT'S YOUR ROLE HERE?

15:42.071 --> 15:44.769
I'M SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
IN CHARGE OF NEW PRODUCTS.

[inhales]

15:48.469 --> 15:49.861
MAR--MARIJUANA?

15:49.905 --> 15:52.299
OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT MARIJUANA

15:52.342 --> 15:55.432
WILL BE DECRIMINALIZED
IN OUR LIFETIME.

15:55.476 --> 15:58.914
OH.AND JG ALLEN WILL BE
READY TO EMBRACE THAT MARKET.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.872
STILL A CONTROVERSIAL AREA,

16:00.916 --> 16:02.526
HENCE THE SECRECY.

16:02.570 --> 16:05.921
SO YOU WERE HAVING JEREMY REESE
GROW YOU SOME CORPORATE WEED?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.792
HE WAS DEVELOPING
A FUNGUS-RESISTANT

16:07.836 --> 16:09.925
MASS-PRODUCIBLE
MARIJUANA STRAIN.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.015
PROJECT TURBO WOLF.
IT WAS PART OF MY PORTFOLIO.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.625
PROJECT TURBO WOLF?

16:14.669 --> 16:16.018
MM-HMM.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.846
UH, WE HEARD THAT JEREMY
WAS ARGUING WITH HIS BOSS.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.848
BUT IT WASN'T AT
HIS DAY JOB, WAS IT?

16:19.891 --> 16:21.023
IT WAS YOU.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.677
WELL, DISAGREEMENTS
BETWEEN RESEARCHERS

16:22.720 --> 16:24.984
AND THE PRODUCT TEAM
ARE COMMON.

16:25.027 --> 16:28.422
AND THERE WAS A SPIRITED
DISCUSSION A FEW DAYS AGO.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.293
WE HAVEN'T SEEN JEREMY SINCE.

16:30.337 --> 16:33.470
AND... HOW DO I
PUT THIS DELICATELY?

16:33.514 --> 16:37.779
HE HAD JUST HARVESTED
HIS TURBO WOLF SEEDS.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.694
AND WE CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND THEM.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.435
[lowered voice] THAT MAY BE
WHAT WAS IN THE SAFE.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.263
[lowered voice] AH.YOU HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING?

16:43.306 --> 16:47.658
WELL, IT SEEMS SOMEONE
MAY HAVE BOGARTED YOUR STASH.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.052
WELL, WE HAVE TO
FIND THOSE SEEDS.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.185
I MEAN, THIS PROJECT
WILL BE WORTH BILLIONS

16:52.228 --> 16:53.751
TO THE COMPANY ONE DAY.

16:53.795 --> 16:54.752
BILLIONS? WOW.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.363
HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH TODAY?

16:56.406 --> 16:57.842
WELL, I'M SURE
OUR COMPETITORS

16:57.886 --> 17:00.019
WOULD PAY MILLIONS
TO ACQUIRE IT.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.542
I'LL BET YOU
DOLLARS TO DOUGHNUTS

17:01.585 --> 17:03.022
I CAN FIND YOUR SEEDS.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.502
LET'S START WITH A TOUR
OF THE LAB, SHALL WE?

17:07.591 --> 17:10.290
LOOKS LIKE YOUR MARIJUANA
PROJECT IS WELL FUNDED.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.032
WELL, IT'S NOT ALL
JUST MARIJUANA, PER SE.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.686
WE'RE ALSO DEVELOPING A RANGE
OF NON-NARCOTIC PRODUCTS.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.993
JEREMY'S DESK, I IMAGINE?YES, SIR.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.864
IT'S EXACTLY AS HE LEFT IT.

17:19.908 --> 17:20.909
MM.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.878
WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH THIS BOX?

17:33.922 --> 17:37.099
BECAUSE WHENEVER I TOUCH IT,
YOU BLINK RAPIDLY.

17:39.493 --> 17:40.668
UH, NOTHING.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.104
[Lisbon] COULD YOU STEP BACK,
MR. PIERCE?

17:42.148 --> 17:44.324
THANK YOU.
MAKING ME NERVOUS.

17:49.851 --> 17:51.200
[Patrick] HMM.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.335
OH.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.076
THAT LOOKS LIKE A BUG.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.208
COOL.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.731
[Rigsby]
SUMMER EDGECOMBE.

18:00.775 --> 18:04.083
WOW.YEAH.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.084

18:05.127 --> 18:06.607
THAT'S NOT YOURS, IS IT?

18:06.650 --> 18:08.783
NO.

18:08.826 --> 18:11.394
SHE'S IN TOWN FOR HER WEDDING
TO THE BABY'S FATHER.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.136
GONNA BE A PRETTY
BIG DEAL, APPARENTLY.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.572
WOW.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.226
YOU SAID THAT.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.098
YEP. YOU DODGED A BULLET

18:19.141 --> 18:21.100
WHEN YOU LET THAT ONE
SLIP AWAY.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.499
OH, MY GOD. KIMBALL.

18:29.543 --> 18:30.500
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

18:30.544 --> 18:32.415
I'M IN TOWN FOR, LIKE,
FIVE DAYS,

18:32.459 --> 18:34.939
AND BOOM--HERE WE ARE.
LIKE OLD TIMES.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.115
YEAH. JUST LIKE.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.551
[laughs]

18:37.594 --> 18:39.118
SUMMER, WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME
IF YOU WERE IN TROUBLE?

18:39.161 --> 18:40.945
I WASN'T IN TROUBLE.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.251
WELL, YOU ARE NOW.

18:42.295 --> 18:45.298
OH, PLEASE. THIS? YOU CAN
MAKE THIS GO AWAY.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.343
I'M A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.128
I GOT JUICE
IN THIS BUILDING.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.608
YEAH, BUT YOU WERE IN A GARAGE
FULL OF PHONY CASH.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.219
NO. NO, NO, NO. NO.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.134
CHUCK SAID WE WERE
JUST GOING FOR A RIDE.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.787
I WAS BORED, SO I WENT.

18:56.831 --> 18:59.790
AND THEN HE SAID HE HAD TO
STOP BY SOME FRIENDS'.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.575
AND... WELL, WHEN I GOT THERE,

19:01.618 --> 19:03.098
I REALIZED IT WAS A BAD DEAL.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.795
BY THEN, IT WAS TOO LATE.

19:04.839 --> 19:05.970
MM-HMM.HMM.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.189
EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT?

19:07.233 --> 19:08.364
MM-HMM.

19:08.408 --> 19:09.931
HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK
I THINK YOU ARE?

19:09.974 --> 19:13.804
UH, I SWEAR,
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO

19:13.848 --> 19:16.155
WITH THIS COUNTERFEITING,
OR WHATEVER.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.547
LIKE, AT ALL.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.854
ASK THOSE GUYS.WELL, THEY'RE NOT TALKING.

19:19.897 --> 19:22.813
WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
THE WEDDING'S IN TWO DAYS.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.598
I-I CAN'T STAY HERE.

19:24.641 --> 19:25.903
YOUR BUDDY CHUCK COULD HELP.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.644
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.385
DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I BELIEVE.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.866
IT MATTERS TO ME, KIMBALL.

19:31.909 --> 19:34.651
I-I-I DID WHAT YOU SAID.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.827
I WENT TO SEATTLE.
I GOT CLEANED UP.

19:36.871 --> 19:39.439
AND--AND MARSHALL, HE'S NICE.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.224
HE'S--HE'S IN REAL ESTATE.
WE HAVE A HOUSE.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.225
THAT'S GOOD.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.184
AND IF THIS GUY'S
HALFWAY DECENT,

19:45.227 --> 19:46.185
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.274
NO, NO, NO.
HE CAN'T KNOW.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.624
HE THINKS I'M AT MY SISTER'S.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.843
LOOK, I LOVE HIM.

19:52.887 --> 19:56.456
BUT THERE'S
THINGS ABOUT ME...

19:56.499 --> 19:58.240
PLEASE?

19:58.284 --> 20:00.547
NO ONE ELSE
IS GONNA HELP ME.

20:02.984 --> 20:06.596
[sighs]

20:06.640 --> 20:08.772
TELL ME WHERE
TO FIND CHUCK.

30:32.004 --> 30:34.833
THE IMAGINARY MAN HAS A HOTEL?

30:34.876 --> 30:35.921
THAT'S RIGHT.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.879
IS THIS HOTEL IMAGINARY, TOO?

30:37.923 --> 30:39.663
OH, NO, VERY REAL.

30:39.707 --> 30:42.101
IT'S, UH, THE VISTA
IN CLEARLAKE.

30:42.144 --> 30:44.451
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
IN AN HOUR. BYE.

30:44.494 --> 30:45.539
[snaps phone shut]

30:48.107 --> 30:51.240
[Patrick] JEREMY WAS KILLED
FOR HIS SEEDS.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.155
BUT THE KILLER'S FACED
WITH A PROBLEM.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.635
WHO WANTS TO PAY
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

30:54.678 --> 30:56.332
FOR A HANDFUL OF SEEDS?

30:56.376 --> 30:57.856
SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS
THEIR VALUE.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.553
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
A VERY LIMITED MARKET,

30:59.596 --> 31:01.294
AND WITH A MURDER
INVESTIGATION AFOOT,

31:01.337 --> 31:03.470
I AM BETTING THAT THE KILLER
IS DESPERATE ENOUGH

31:03.513 --> 31:05.776
TO SELL NOW
AND GET OUT OF TOWN.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.300
SO YOU MADE UP A FAKE BUYER?

31:07.343 --> 31:09.302
OLIVIER GANS.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.304
AND THE REST OF THE NOTE
IS CAESAR CODE.

31:11.347 --> 31:13.306
EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING
THAT JEREMY WOULD USE

31:13.349 --> 31:14.916
TO HIDE HIS INFORMATION.

31:14.960 --> 31:18.964
IT TRANSLATES TO "3:00 P.M.
FRIDAY AT THE VISTA."

31:19.007 --> 31:20.574
WHO'S GONNA FIGURE THAT OUT?

31:20.617 --> 31:22.315
WHOEVER HAS MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS AT STAKE.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.230
ASSUMING THEY DO,
WE CAN'T ARREST SOMEBODY

31:24.273 --> 31:26.667
FOR KNOCKING ON A DOOR.I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.322
THAT'S WHY WE'RE GONNA GET THEM
TO SELL US THE MERCHANDISE.

31:29.365 --> 31:30.540
OLIVIER?[knocks]

31:30.584 --> 31:31.585
YOU READY?

31:31.628 --> 31:32.934
[exhales]

31:32.978 --> 31:34.893
UH, YEAH, LOSE THE TIE.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.895
I DON'T THINK OLIVIER GANS
IS A TIE GUY.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.157
OKAY, YOU GOT IT.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.116
SEE THAT FACE?

31:41.160 --> 31:43.466
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU THE PLAN.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.512
IT'S NOT A GOOD PLAN.IT'S A GOOD ENOUGH PLAN,

31:45.555 --> 31:47.949
AND RIGSBY'S WEARING
ONE OF THOSE EAR THINGIES.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.169
I WILL TALK HIM THROUGH THE CON.
HE'LL BE FINE.

31:50.212 --> 31:51.953
WHAT IF THE KILLER
DOESN'T SHOW UP?

31:51.997 --> 31:54.956
THEN WE GO BACK
TO OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.176
BUT THIS WAY, WE GET TO ENJOY
SOME ROOM SERVICE.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.438
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

32:00.788 --> 32:03.356
[clears throat]

32:08.970 --> 32:11.190
ENOUGH OF THE CHEESE.

32:11.233 --> 32:13.061
I'm hungry.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.716
JANE, IT'S 3:15.

32:15.759 --> 32:17.152
PATIENCE.

32:18.588 --> 32:21.417
[sighs] [phone rings]

32:21.461 --> 32:22.984
HELLO?

32:23.028 --> 32:24.899
YEAH. SEND HIM UP.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.293
[receiver clatters]

32:27.336 --> 32:29.382
[clears throat]

32:29.425 --> 32:30.513
On the way.

32:31.862 --> 32:34.822
[exhales]

32:37.999 --> 32:39.435
MR. GANS, IS IT?

32:39.479 --> 32:40.610
AND WHO ARE YOU?

32:40.654 --> 32:42.264
JEREMY COULDN'T BE HERE.

32:42.308 --> 32:44.571
YOU'LL CONDUCT BUSINESS
WITH ME TODAY.

32:44.614 --> 32:46.616
I'M FRANCESCA.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.749
YEAH. COME IN.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.229
ONCE SHE MAKES HER OFFER,
YOU SWEEP IN

32:50.272 --> 32:53.014
AND MAKE YOUR ARREST. IFSHE MAKES THE OFFER.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.363
[mutters indistinctly]

32:54.407 --> 32:56.235
HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT A COP?

32:56.278 --> 32:57.845
[Patrick on earpiece]
Easy there, tiger.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.021
Chicken's already in the coop.
Let's not overdo it.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.589
THE COPS DON'T HAVE
THE REAL DEAL.

33:02.632 --> 33:04.112
I DO.

33:04.156 --> 33:06.549
THERE'S ONLY ONE
TURBO WOLF.

33:08.464 --> 33:11.076
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAMPLE
THE PRODUCT?

33:11.119 --> 33:12.903
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.430
[Patrick chuckles]

33:17.473 --> 33:18.909
[flicks lighter twice]

33:18.953 --> 33:21.695
GET HER TO SHOW YOU
THE SEEDS.

33:25.090 --> 33:29.007
[inhales and coughs]

33:29.050 --> 33:30.443
[strained voice] THAT'S NICE.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.706
REALLY SMOOTH.

33:32.749 --> 33:35.839
IT'S A 60/40
INDICA DOMINANT HYBRID,

33:35.883 --> 33:38.668
IDEAL FOR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION
OF SMOKABLE APPLICATIONS

33:38.712 --> 33:40.279
AS WELL AS FOR PILLS,

33:40.322 --> 33:42.150
ORAL SPRAYS,
AND DERMAL PATCHES.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.631
[exhales] STRONG.

33:44.674 --> 33:47.851
AND, UH, WHERE ARE THE SEEDS?

33:49.070 --> 33:50.550
I'M GOING IN.

33:50.593 --> 33:53.596
[knock on door]

33:53.640 --> 33:54.858
WHO'S THAT?

33:54.902 --> 33:56.077
UH, IT'S NOT US.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.861
Just--Just answer it.

33:57.905 --> 34:00.603
[normal voice] Y-YOU JUST
STAY THERE. I GOT THIS.

34:00.647 --> 34:03.215
[sighs]

34:05.565 --> 34:08.307
HI. UH, YOU'RE GANS?

34:08.350 --> 34:09.699
DEPENDS.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.745
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
TURBO WOLF, RIGHT?

34:13.225 --> 34:15.140
UH, COULD YOU PASS
THE CHEESE PLATE?

34:15.183 --> 34:21.624
THIS IS GETTING GOOD.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.279
GET IN HERE.[exhales]

34:24.323 --> 34:26.629
THEY CAN'T BOTH HAVE
TURBO WOLF.

34:26.673 --> 34:29.458
NO, BUT ONE OF THEM
KILLED JEREMY FOR IT.

34:29.502 --> 34:30.938
ALL RIGHT,
THEN I'M PULLING THE PLUG.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.722
WE CAN BRING THEM IN
AND TALK TO THEM.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.985
PISH POSH.
HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.

34:35.029 --> 34:36.378
LET'S JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

34:36.422 --> 34:38.163
WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

34:38.206 --> 34:40.034
ME? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

34:40.078 --> 34:42.732
[laughs] OH.
YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER?

34:42.776 --> 34:45.083
THAT'S NICE.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.346
THE POT BUSINESS
IS FAIRLY SMALL.

34:47.389 --> 34:50.566
THOUGH I'M IN THE POT
BUSINESS, AND, UH,

34:50.610 --> 34:53.439
I DON'T KNOW
EITHER OF YOU.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.267
AM I TALKING LOUD?

34:55.310 --> 34:57.573
YOU'RE DOING FINE, RIGSBY.
WHAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT--

34:57.617 --> 35:00.098
THE STORY WITH MATTHEW GOLD.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.752
PLEASE. S--

35:02.796 --> 35:04.798
OH, I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.539
YOU DO?MM, MAYBE.

35:06.582 --> 35:08.584
UH, W-WE DIVIDE AND CONQUER,

35:08.628 --> 35:10.717
UH, GIVE THEM A CHANCE
TO SPLIT THE MONEY.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.067
RIGSBY, WE'RE GONNA PLAY
A LITTLE GAME.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.548
IT'S CALLED "REPEAT AFTER ME."

35:15.591 --> 35:17.637
"I CAN UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE NERVOUS..."

35:17.680 --> 35:20.292
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NERVOUS.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.424
"YOU'RE BOTH TRYING TO SELL
A DEAD MAN'S WORK."

35:22.468 --> 35:27.037
YOU'RE BOTH TRYING TO SELL
A DEAD MAN'S PRODUCT.

35:27.081 --> 35:29.170
HERE'S THE THING.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.433
MY CLIENT JUST WANTS RESULTS.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.480
"THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN PROVENANCE."

35:34.523 --> 35:36.743
THEY'RE NOT CONCERNED
WITH PROVOLONE--

35:36.786 --> 35:38.397
PROVENANCE.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.877
THEY... [chuckles] THEY'RE NOT
CONCERNED WITH PROVENANCE.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.618
THEY DON'T CARE
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

35:42.662 --> 35:45.839
"YOU BOTH CLAIM TO HAVE
TURBO WOLF TO SELL ME."

35:45.882 --> 35:49.582
YOU BOTH CLAIM THAT YOU'RE
SELLING TURBO WOLF.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.497
ONLY ONE OF YOU IS RIGHT.

35:51.540 --> 35:54.152
"NOW I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY
TO HASH THIS OUT..."

35:54.195 --> 35:55.501
SO HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.854
I HAVE $4 MILLION.

36:04.597 --> 36:08.949
That's the price that
Jeremy and I discussed.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.124
Now...

36:10.168 --> 36:13.736
I'M WILLING
TO BUY BOTH YOUR SEEDS...

36:13.780 --> 36:15.347
and you guys can split
the money.

36:15.390 --> 36:16.391
Or...

36:17.610 --> 36:19.612
[snorts]

36:19.655 --> 36:21.222
OR...

36:21.266 --> 36:24.965
ONE OF YOU CAN PROVE THAT
YOU HAVE THE REAL DEAL.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.793
AND YOU GET IT ALL.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.795
[snickers]

36:28.838 --> 36:30.492
$2 MILLION EACH?

36:30.536 --> 36:32.190
I CAN LIVE ON THAT.

36:32.233 --> 36:33.495
[seeds rattling]

36:33.539 --> 36:35.628
[exhales]

36:35.671 --> 36:37.064
I'M SURE YOUCAN,

36:37.107 --> 36:39.240
BUT I DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR HALF OF ANYTHING.

36:39.284 --> 36:41.982
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
LET'S TAKE THE DEAL.

36:42.025 --> 36:44.027
WHY?

36:44.071 --> 36:46.029
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE,

36:46.073 --> 36:48.206
BUT MY PRODUCT IS AUTHENTIC.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.295
I HIRED THE TEAM
THAT GREW IT.

36:50.338 --> 36:51.644
[exhales]

36:51.687 --> 36:54.212
YOU POACHED A KID
THAT I TRAINED.

36:54.255 --> 36:55.648
THANKS FOR THE HEAD START.

36:55.691 --> 36:58.172
WE'RE GETTING
INTO THE WEEDS HERE.I'M ON IT.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.521
"OKAY, LET'S NOT GET PERSONAL."

36:59.565 --> 37:01.697
LET'S NOT GET, UH, PERSONAL.

37:01.741 --> 37:04.091
LET'S... HAVE SOME CHEESE,
HUH? [chuckles]

37:05.571 --> 37:08.182
[mouth full]
IF WE CAN'T MAKE A DEAL,

37:08.226 --> 37:09.488
I'M GONNA WALK OUT OF HERE
RIGHT NOW.

37:09.531 --> 37:12.012
FINE. I'M NOT SPLITTING.

37:13.448 --> 37:15.320
YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD,
MATTHEW.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.583
ALL RIGHT, YEAH. YEAH.

37:17.626 --> 37:19.019
SHE MIGHT HAVE GROWN
THIS STUFF,

37:19.062 --> 37:20.673
BUT JEREMY CAME TO ME
WHEN SHE TRIED

37:20.716 --> 37:22.283
TO PUT HIS PRODUCT ON ICE.

37:22.327 --> 37:25.373
I CONVINCED...

37:25.417 --> 37:28.768
I CONVINCED HIM TO STEAL
HIS SEEDS FROM THE LAB.

37:28.811 --> 37:31.249
THE SAME SEEDS I TOOK
FROM HIS SAFE.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.772
SHE'S GOT NOTHING.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.774
[sighs] OH, MY GOD.

37:34.817 --> 37:36.297
YEAH, WHAT?YOU KILLED HIM?

37:36.341 --> 37:38.256
YOU NEED ME TO SPELL IT OUT
FOR YOU?

37:38.299 --> 37:41.259
I'M NOT WALKING AWAY
WITH HALF NOW. I WANT IT ALL!

37:41.302 --> 37:42.869
OKAY, HANDS IN THE AIR!

37:42.912 --> 37:44.566
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:45.611 --> 37:47.613
UM, I-I MEAN, NOBODY MOVE!WHOA.

37:47.656 --> 37:49.528
I'M A COP.
JUST... NOBODY MOVE. SEE?

37:49.571 --> 37:52.400
MATTHEW GOLD,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR MURDER![exhales]

37:52.444 --> 37:54.620
RIGSBY, HOOK HER UP, TOO.WAIT--FOR WHAT?

37:54.663 --> 37:56.404
INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE,
TO START WITH.

37:56.448 --> 37:57.536
YEAH, I GOT IT. [snorts]

37:57.579 --> 37:59.799
OOH... UH, NOPE.
I'M...

37:59.842 --> 38:01.757
I'M GONNA SIT DOWN.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.324
MMM.LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.021
NOW! YOU, TOO.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.894
BOSS, IS IT OKAY
IF I SIT DOWN?

38:07.937 --> 38:09.809
YOU ARE SITTING DOWN, RIGSBY.

38:12.115 --> 38:14.553
I FELT BETRAYED, YOU KNOW?

38:14.596 --> 38:16.816
THAT HE'D GO BEHIND
MY BACK LIKE THAT.

38:16.859 --> 38:20.298
[scoffs] AND FOR
A TOBACCO COMPANY?

38:20.341 --> 38:22.256
THEN I FIGURED

38:22.300 --> 38:24.258
THEY GAVE HIM RESOURCES
I COULDN'T.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.912
[Van Pelt]
AND WHEN THEY TOLD HIM

38:25.955 --> 38:28.567
THEY WERE PUTTING HIS PROJECT
ON HOLD FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG,

38:28.610 --> 38:30.656
YOU CONVINCED HIM
TO STEAL IT BACK.

38:30.699 --> 38:32.745
[Gold] I TOLD HIM WITH...

38:32.788 --> 38:35.748
MY REPUTATION, WE COULD
OFFER HIS STRAIN TO THE WORLD.

38:35.791 --> 38:38.228
BUT THAT WAS NEVER
YOUR INTENT.

38:40.187 --> 38:42.972
I SHOULD BE RICH
BY NOW, YOU KNOW?

38:43.016 --> 38:45.410
BUT THIS WHOLE INDUSTRY,
THE--

38:45.453 --> 38:47.934
THE RULES CHANGE EVERY DAY.

38:47.977 --> 38:49.762
I KNEW WHEN HE CAME TO ME,
I...

38:49.805 --> 38:52.460
I COULD TAKE THIS STUFF,
YOU KNOW?

38:52.504 --> 38:55.028
I KNEW HE'D BE AT THE GYM.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.641
I TRIED TO TELL MYSELF
THE GUN WAS JUST THERE

38:59.685 --> 39:01.774
SO HE'D GIVE ME
THE KEYS TO THE SAFE.

39:01.817 --> 39:04.429
BUT...

39:04.472 --> 39:05.821
I KNEW.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.651
I HAD ALREADY GONE
TOO FAR.

39:09.695 --> 39:12.393
I GOTTA HAND IT TO HER.
SHE PLAYED YOU ALL.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.743
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

39:14.787 --> 39:16.354
FRANCESCA.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.834
SHE JUST CONFESSED.

39:18.878 --> 39:21.707
ONCE JEREMY'S WORK
WENT INTO COLD STORAGE,

39:21.750 --> 39:23.491
SHE KNEW HE'D SNEAK
BACK INTO THE LAB

39:23.535 --> 39:25.450
TO STEAL HIS SEEDS.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.452
THAT'S WHY SHE SWITCHED
THEM OUT FIRST,

39:27.495 --> 39:31.107
SO SHE COULD SELL THEM
FOR HERSELF ON THE BLACK MARKET.

39:31.151 --> 39:35.111
YOU MEAN FRANCESCA HAD
THE TURBO WOLF ALL ALONG?

39:35.155 --> 39:36.635
YEP.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.158
YOU KILLED YOUR PROTEGE

39:38.201 --> 39:39.986
FOR A HANDFUL
OF WORTHLESS HEMP SEEDS.

39:40.029 --> 39:42.162
[exhales]

39:46.514 --> 39:49.169
AGENT WADE.[zipper zips]

39:49.212 --> 39:50.910
[sighs]

39:52.215 --> 39:54.348
