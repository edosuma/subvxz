11:14.215 --> 11:15.758
[laughing]

11:17.551 --> 11:20.971
Calm down, just don't use your tongue, OK?

11:21.055 --> 11:23.599
It's doesn't look good on camera
and you block me.

11:23.682 --> 11:25.267
Let's go for take two, shall we?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.603
Yes, my first wedding was inside a prison,

11:27.686 --> 11:30.064
but now I want something different,
you know?

11:30.147 --> 11:34.068
-More traditional, like, I don't know...
-Underwater?

11:34.318 --> 11:36.153
In a shark sanctuary?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.655
[laughing]

11:37.738 --> 11:40.825
-Honey, don't you think that's a little...
-Dangerous?

11:41.283 --> 11:44.453
Love is always very dangerous
to the young at heart!

11:44.995 --> 11:46.163
You sexy kitty!

11:47.164 --> 11:48.874
It's true.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.419
[crew] Samantha, Samantha!

11:52.336 --> 11:54.505
I haven't been this excited
about a wedding

11:54.588 --> 11:56.215
since season three!

11:56.298 --> 11:59.718
Can you give me some old pictures later
to put on the wedding episode?

11:59.802 --> 12:02.263
There's a box in the closet
full of those things.

12:02.346 --> 12:05.433
-The contract, did you talk to Marcinho?
-[crew] Don't worry about it!

12:05.516 --> 12:08.436
The important thing is the prestige
this show will bring you!

12:08.519 --> 12:12.398
Look at this, it's great.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.233
Thanks. But I wanted to try that one.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.861
My favorite part
is trying out the dresses!

12:16.944 --> 12:18.362
Samantha, there's no need.

12:18.446 --> 12:22.283
I've decided everything with Flavio.
The shape of this one looks luxurious.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.328
Now put on this mask.
Does it distort the face?

12:26.412 --> 12:28.831
[crew] It does,
but it's from our sponsors. Here!

12:35.254 --> 12:36.755
-Surprise!
-No!

12:36.839 --> 12:38.716
It's bad luck to see the dress, Flavio!

12:38.799 --> 12:42.303
There's no bad luck here! If anything
goes wrong, we repeat the take.

12:42.386 --> 12:45.639
The network thinks that Dodoi
is going to make a great best man.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.808
[Flavio Jr.] Come here.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.812
Just turn to me.
Yes, leave the logo at the front.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.731
[Flavio Jr.] Beautiful.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.232
[Samantha sighs]

12:58.068 --> 12:59.737
[whispering to crew] Go, go, go.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.622
What's up? All good?

13:11.373 --> 13:14.126
I thought you chose me
to be the leading lady of your life,

13:14.210 --> 13:15.920
not an extra without any lines.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.464
You're right.
I need to share more with you.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.509
We are one now.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.219
Two halves of a tangerine.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.013
I thought of you when I wrote that song. No, you didn't, you wrote it 20 years ago.

13:28.057 --> 13:32.978
Since we're alone, just the two of us,
let's discuss the only thing missing.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.316
Ah, finally!
Pay, contract, those things, right?

13:37.399 --> 13:41.028
Divorce. We have to discuss
the course of our divorce.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.738
We need to surprise the audience!

13:43.572 --> 13:46.617
We're going to come up with the divorce
before we get married?

13:46.700 --> 13:50.371
We don't have to come up with anything,
The writers have already done it.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.749
For example, here, we have many options...

13:54.208 --> 13:57.169
In this one, I swap you
for a younger girl.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.964
I don't like it
because it makes me seem old, right?

14:00.047 --> 14:04.301
And there's another one
where you disappear on a yacht.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.805
I leave this season?
Flavio, I thought you liked me!

14:07.888 --> 14:10.266
I adore you,
otherwise you wouldn't be here.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.850
There were 23 girls.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.936
At least I got first place, right?

14:14.019 --> 14:16.522
Second. First place got a part
in a soap opera.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.152
[Dodoi] Hey, guys and girls!

14:28.450 --> 14:31.412
[crew, quietly] Film this! Come on!

14:33.455 --> 14:35.165
The guy had to stay here all day?

14:35.249 --> 14:38.961
-I thought of celebrating with the family.
-[Samantha] Celebrate what, Dodoi?

14:39.044 --> 14:42.006
The director said no bachelor party.
It doesn't fit the budget.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.883
I'm talking about me.

14:43.966 --> 14:48.053
I did crazy well at work today.
Everyone liked it. You're good?

14:48.137 --> 14:49.805
Everything's great, wonderful.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.767
In fact, I need to arrange the details
of my wedding with the team.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.603
Excuse me. Guys, let's go over here.

14:55.686 --> 14:58.689
[Samantha] It'd be great to shoot
in front of this painting. Look!

15:04.987 --> 15:07.573
[Samantha] I have to protect my role,
get it?

15:07.656 --> 15:10.534
I know this show is Flavio Jr.'s,
but what will happen?

15:10.618 --> 15:12.411
He'll want to wear my wedding dress.

15:12.494 --> 15:16.165
And the director rejected my clothes.
She said they were all rags!

15:16.248 --> 15:20.502
She offered me 100 reals to flunk my grade
and said it would make great drama.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.422
It's absurd that they'd talk to you
without consulting me!

15:24.006 --> 15:26.008
Mom, I think you need a spin-off.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.052
My love, I already tried that diet. No.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.679
No, Mom. Your own show.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.600
On Flavio's show, you are the moon,
you have to be the sun. More than the sun, baby, I can be a star!

15:38.604 --> 15:41.941
-[Cindy] The sun is a star.
-Don't ruin the moment, Cindy.

15:42.816 --> 15:47.112
Flavio Jr. can be everything:
famous, rich, talented, handsome!

15:47.363 --> 15:51.408
-But without love...
-Wow, Flavio, so beautiful!

15:51.492 --> 15:52.743
You make me so emotional.

15:52.826 --> 15:56.789
I think from now on we should totally make
these testimonials together, always.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.750
Flavio, he really doesn't live
without love.

16:00.834 --> 16:04.213
[both] Mmm!

16:04.672 --> 16:06.006
[Samantha laughs]

16:06.090 --> 16:09.760
This walnut cake is delicious!
This is the one.

16:09.843 --> 16:14.056
But try this one, so delicious!
I'm allergic to walnuts.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.350
That's great! Ha!

16:17.434 --> 16:19.520
-[Flavio Jr.] Mmm!
-[Samantha laughs]

16:19.937 --> 16:24.650
It has walnuts too. A glottis edema
will be good for the episode.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.362
I trust your taste, handsome.

16:28.445 --> 16:33.409
Actually, I think the important thing
is to use Heart Sugar!

16:33.492 --> 16:36.370
I completely forgot to tell you
about this sponsor.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.499
[Samantha] Mmm! Just a minute, handsome.
I forgot something!

16:46.630 --> 16:48.340
[to herself] What a pain!

16:48.424 --> 16:50.050
[Samantha] What are you doing here?

16:50.134 --> 16:53.762
-I just want to eat in peace!
-My wedding cake?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.055
What? Want some?

16:55.139 --> 16:59.184
I came to change my bra, Dodoi. They said
that the color red films a lot better.

16:59.268 --> 17:04.647
-I know. It's Flavio Jr.'s favorite color.
-You're jealous of my success, aren't you?

17:04.732 --> 17:07.443
Yours or his?
Samantha, just let it go, alright?

17:07.526 --> 17:10.695
I'm starting something new,
I don't have time to think about you.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.699
Everyone knows broadcasting
is an athletes' graveyard.

17:13.781 --> 17:15.701
I'm not just a commentator, OK?

17:15.784 --> 17:18.369
The team is at the top of its game
because of me.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.289
"Lucky Charm Dodoi" has 13 letters!

17:20.372 --> 17:21.498
It has 15.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.960
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to get back to work.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.505
I'm going to eat a hot dog
because the ketchup is our sponsor.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.966
[crew] <i>Samantha, we're all set!</i>

17:31.925 --> 17:35.387
This damn door! This damn freaking door!

17:35.471 --> 17:36.889
[Samantha] Try it, Dodoi...

17:36.972 --> 17:38.682
[Samantha laughs]

17:38.766 --> 17:41.602
I told you to fix this damn door!

17:44.063 --> 17:49.610
Hiding? So you were here?

17:49.693 --> 17:51.695
[sniffs] It smells like sex!

17:51.779 --> 17:55.824
-We were just talking, that's all.
-[crew] Locked in the closet, of course!

17:55.908 --> 18:00.245
I just want to redo this scene.
I want Flavio to catch you!

18:00.746 --> 18:04.458
-I told you that nothing happened! Stop!
-I'm going to hang with Rogerio.

18:04.875 --> 18:09.296
You can't miss this.
From below, look, so dramatic!

18:10.297 --> 18:15.636
Mmm! So tasty! Berenice Ketchup!
It's delicious!

18:16.428 --> 18:17.346
Mmm!

18:17.429 --> 18:20.808
[crew] Samantha, is everything OK
between you and your ex?

18:20.891 --> 18:25.729
What do you mean? Of course!
Berenice Ketchup is a delight!

18:26.355 --> 18:30.109
[crew] I don't know, just wondering,
if suddenly,

18:30.192 --> 18:34.113
now that he's famous again,
if it hasn't left you a little jealous?

18:34.196 --> 18:37.157
I only think about the show,
I mean, about Flavio Jr.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.701
He's everything to me. [giggles]

18:40.327 --> 18:45.791
[crew] OK, fine. Since you don't want
to talk, we'll film him doing Pilates.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.167
[crew] Let's go, boys.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.086
Hey, people, chill.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.005
Let's do it. Alright.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.050
[sighs]

19:00.264 --> 19:01.431
OK.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.518
I'm going to talk... about Dodoi...

19:05.102 --> 19:06.478
...up close.

19:06.562 --> 19:10.065
Great! So we'll start with the scene
where you sign the divorce papers.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.651
What are you talking about?

19:13.152 --> 19:16.196
Samantha, in order to marry again,
you have to be divorced.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.448
And I found the papers
with your old photos.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.285
The funny thing is that he signed it
but you didn't.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.038
I had lots of stuff to do.
I forgot! What's the problem?

19:25.122 --> 19:28.208
Does he know?
I mean, that would be a great episode!

19:28.292 --> 19:31.295
Look, this is just bureaucracy, OK?
Do you want me to sign it?

19:31.378 --> 19:33.589
Give it to me. I'll sign it. Excuse me!

19:35.000 --> 19:41.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:42.598 --> 19:43.849
[sighs]

19:44.725 --> 19:47.227
Look, it doesn't matter
if the love of my life

19:47.311 --> 19:49.062
was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.231
What matters is I found
my Prince Charming,

19:51.315 --> 19:53.567
and I'm totally happy, right, babe?

19:53.650 --> 19:55.861
What's 12 years
for a love that's infinite?

19:57.863 --> 19:59.239
[sighs]

20:01.408 --> 20:05.037
[crew] <i>Samantha, we have to film you</i>
<i>being insecure again.</i>

20:05.412 --> 20:07.289
<i>[crew] Viewers want to see runny noses.</i>

20:12.377 --> 20:13.545
Yeah, Rogerio...

20:14.046 --> 20:16.465
I'm being honest with you
because I like your face.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.385
It's not easy.
I finally make a move and she runs away.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.221
Do you understand me?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.973
[Dodoi sighs]

20:25.057 --> 20:27.476
You can't have everything in this life,
Rogerio.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.733
<i>I'm afraid, you know, Flavio?</i>

20:34.816 --> 20:38.612
<i>Afraid to give myself over to love again.</i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>

20:38.695 --> 20:42.741
No way she said that! Genius! Diva!

20:42.824 --> 20:45.452
For the last 20 minutes
the show's been just about mom!

20:45.535 --> 20:48.497
But is she really ready
to live through this new romance?

20:49.122 --> 20:52.042
I don't know! I think she hasn't
gotten over her ex yet.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.379
-[Cindy] What about the kids?
-Tell me about it!

20:55.587 --> 20:58.340
Can't wait to see
how they will deal with the divorce!

21:01.927 --> 21:04.096
[crowd cheers]

21:08.934 --> 21:11.311
Do I have to?
I don't want to talk about Samantha.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.481
Your team, Dodoi,
they can't fall asleep at the wheel.

21:14.564 --> 21:18.151
-This match is so important for you guys!
-That's right, Jailson.

21:18.235 --> 21:22.281
Big Mengo depends on this result
to continue in the competition.

21:22.364 --> 21:26.702
-And Ituverava is the favorite, Dodoi!
-I know. Ituverava is at the top now...

21:26.785 --> 21:30.831
Ituverava? They're undefeated in 11 games!

21:30.914 --> 21:34.793
I know. It's not because Franca is losing
that they can't get into the game again.

21:34.876 --> 21:38.005
-If they score a--
-Goal! It's a goal!

21:38.088 --> 21:39.589
[crowd cheers]

21:39.673 --> 21:46.054
It's impossible! Dodoi said it,
and the crowd has gone crazy.

21:46.138 --> 21:52.102
Chanting and shouting the name
of their old Big Mengo idol!

21:52.185 --> 21:56.481
And you, tuned into Radio Jiquitaia,
are listening to this electrifying match!

21:56.565 --> 22:00.402
-[Dodoi] Will there be one more--
-Goal!

22:00.485 --> 22:06.074
This result puts Flamengo
in the semi-final!

22:06.158 --> 22:10.370
[Jailson] Check it out,
Dodoi has won back the fans!

22:10.746 --> 22:12.581
Now they'll sign my contract, right?

22:12.664 --> 22:17.753
Don't think about it! Listen to the crowd
shouting your name! It's pure prestige!

22:17.836 --> 22:21.214
I'm not out of the game yet, right?
I'm here supporting my team!

22:22.215 --> 22:23.592
Hey, guys!

22:26.386 --> 22:28.472
Dodoi, you just ruined the take!

22:28.680 --> 22:31.808
Come in again, dear!
Looking angry and jealous, OK?

22:31.892 --> 22:33.393
-[crew] Let's go.
-[Flavio] Perfect!

22:33.477 --> 22:36.021
You're right on time
for the rehearsal dinner.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.859
I'm not going to the wedding!
It's on the same day as the semi-final.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.736
Cindy and Brandon, are you coming?

22:44.112 --> 22:47.324
I hate soccer. And I hate kids.

22:47.407 --> 22:51.203
Absolutely not! They'll walk in with us
during the ceremony.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.370
Right, cuties?

22:52.788 --> 22:54.414
Cindy, our flower girl!

22:54.498 --> 22:56.291
Wow, my dream!

22:56.374 --> 22:58.710
[Dodoi] We're going to celebrate
my new job!

22:58.794 --> 23:01.338
Can someone mention the ketchup?

23:01.421 --> 23:03.882
The kids will go to the church
with their mother!

23:06.760 --> 23:10.597
Thank you so much, Flavio.
But I don't need anyone to defend me.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.059
-They're our kids, mine and Dodoi's!
-There, you see, Flavio Jr.!

23:14.142 --> 23:16.061
This is my family, you're the intruder.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.938
[crew] Family is all about ketchup!

23:18.021 --> 23:20.273
What's this family business? You crazy?

23:20.357 --> 23:23.985
I've been here for 12 years taking care
of them while you were there in jail!

23:24.069 --> 23:25.195
Go figure!

23:25.278 --> 23:27.823
That's it.
It's time for Samantha to be happy.

23:27.906 --> 23:28.949
The children are hers

23:29.032 --> 23:31.618
and having them at the wedding
is essential for the show!

23:31.701 --> 23:32.869
The decision is made.

23:33.995 --> 23:37.207
The house is mine. The children are mine.

23:37.290 --> 23:40.877
-They'll go to the wedding if I want to!
-And they're not going!

23:40.961 --> 23:42.379
[Flavio] The show is mine!

23:42.462 --> 23:46.800
And the wedding will be
light, sweet and sponsored!

23:46.883 --> 23:53.181
[laughing] Light, sweet and sponsored.
How cool!

23:53.640 --> 23:59.980
Woo! You OK now, sweetie?
Sugar Heart, sweet as a dream!

24:00.063 --> 24:01.231
I'll sue you!

24:01.982 --> 24:03.775
You'll have to sell the kids to pay me!

24:03.859 --> 24:06.945
I'll warn you now, I'm very expensive.

24:07.946 --> 24:11.658
I want to see you show this on F.T.A. TV!
This one goes to [beep].

24:11.741 --> 24:15.328
Don't bother celebrating with the kids,
because my ex works at that radio.

24:15.412 --> 24:18.582
I know who she is! She gave you
a nickname in the WhatsApp group.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.917
[Flavio] "Handsome"?
That's what my women call me!

24:21.001 --> 24:23.420
No, it's not that.
It's "limp-dick", actually!

24:25.130 --> 24:28.383
Wait, hold on! Hit me here,
it's a little better for the camera.

24:28.466 --> 24:29.968
[Samantha screams]

24:30.051 --> 24:32.345
I was really horrified by that scene.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.640
Although I do find it exciting,
two men fighting over me.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.185
Ow!

24:42.814 --> 24:43.940
I'm done!

24:46.109 --> 24:49.321
-I'll see you at the wedding.
-Are you still getting married?

24:49.404 --> 24:52.324
Of course! I honor
my commercial commitments.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.621
Let's go! Out.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.497
[tuts]

25:03.335 --> 25:06.755
[Samantha] Bye, guys! Thank you!

25:06.838 --> 25:09.382
[Samantha] See you tomorrow! Bye!

25:14.971 --> 25:17.849
Are you happy that you
almost destroyed my marriage?

25:18.225 --> 25:20.393
Samantha, your marriage had an end date.

25:20.477 --> 25:24.189
Possibly, Dodoi. But I'm going
to enjoy all my time on the air.

25:24.272 --> 25:27.442
Put a little sugar on him,
see if he gets easier to swallow.

25:27.525 --> 25:31.863
Flavio might have flaws, but at least it's
all there on the contract, no surprises.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.114
[laughs]

25:33.615 --> 25:37.744
Samantha... I've seen you in love.
I know how you get.

25:38.119 --> 25:39.329
Are you into this guy?

25:39.955 --> 25:43.667
Very much so.
Because he's very romantic, alright?

25:43.750 --> 25:45.460
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

25:45.543 --> 25:46.836
Does he have moves?

25:57.097 --> 25:58.306
[crew coughs]

25:59.224 --> 26:01.017
This is not what you're thinking!

26:01.101 --> 26:03.103
You can't come in here at this time!

26:03.186 --> 26:06.314
[crew] Honey, just so you know,
it's 5 p.m., OK?

26:06.398 --> 26:07.691
Oh fuck, the match!

26:08.566 --> 26:11.403
-[crew] Film, film.
-Look, guys, I can explain!

26:11.486 --> 26:13.196
[crew] No, wait, there's no need.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.573
[crew] I'll shoot Flavio
breaking up with you,

26:15.657 --> 26:18.243
and then it's over, your role ends.
That's it. OK?

26:20.787 --> 26:24.374
[TV] <i>And the referee whistles! Game over!</i>

26:25.500 --> 26:29.671
-How about a TV detox at this house?
-Flamengo won without my help.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.383
It's over. I'm not "Lucky Charm Dodoi".

26:34.217 --> 26:36.386
It's over. Luck is not our forte.

26:40.098 --> 26:44.352
-Samantha, about yesterday, I wanted--
-It's OK, Dodoi, it's just a reality show.

26:45.353 --> 26:48.023
-[door opens]
-The kids should be at school!

26:48.106 --> 26:49.941
Calm down, people. They are.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.403
We took them so we could film their day.
Nothing happened.

26:53.486 --> 26:56.156
-You know Brandon has no friends?
-Neither does Cindy. And?

26:56.531 --> 26:58.992
-We forgot Pompom.
-Pompom?

26:59.075 --> 27:03.038
Rogerio, Samantha! The sponsorship from
Little Horses farm, a fortune, a luxury!

27:03.121 --> 27:05.790
-[Samantha] No, no!
-[crew] As if!

27:11.296 --> 27:17.052
No horse, no job, no pay, no contract.
The kids can't watch this episode.

27:19.637 --> 27:20.930
I won't need this anymore.

27:22.515 --> 27:23.767
What is it?

27:24.601 --> 27:28.938
You'll laugh, but it's the divorce papers.
I never signed them.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.567
-Why not?
-I don't know, Dodoi, I forgot!

27:33.026 --> 27:36.029
Also, you were in jail.
It wouldn't have made any difference.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.407
Got it.

27:40.241 --> 27:43.995
You forgot.
Still, why didn't you tell me before?

27:44.079 --> 27:46.956
So I didn't have to look
at that silly little smile of yours.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.043
And so what? What's the problem?
Here, look, it's just paper.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.063
SAMANTHA!

28:10.146 --> 28:11.773
SAMANTHA DECLARES:

28:11.856 --> 28:15.026
"I WON'T MAKE SOAP OPERAS.
I'D RATHER BE FREE FOR OTHER PROJECTS.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.778
MY CAREER COMES FIRST."
