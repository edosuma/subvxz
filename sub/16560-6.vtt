WEBVTT

00:07.966 --> 00:09.968
So Kayla, your mother tells me
you like basketball.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.012
That's one.

00:12.345 --> 00:15.598
My mom's new boyfriends
all do the same three things.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.810
Talking basketball is one.
I call them signature moves.

00:18.893 --> 00:22.230
Okay, well, um, let's try this again.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.485
You got me a gift.
Signature move number two.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.572
-And the gifts always suck.
-Well, this is not just a gift.

00:30.655 --> 00:33.450
It's the gift. You're gonna love it.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.535
Boom.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.374
Normally I'd say I like the gift,
but you seem like a straight shooter.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.918
It's Disney World.
Who doesn't like Disney World.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.254
Teenagers who aren't little kids.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.299
But it's Disney World. I mean,
it's fun for people of all ages.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.635
And that's what they say to get
people of all ages to spend money.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.140
You thought this will go better, huh?

00:57.557 --> 00:59.350
Actually, yeah, to be honest, I did.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.270
I'm just messing with you.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.357
So there are no signature moves?

01:06.816 --> 01:10.779
No and real talk, you're the first
to ever ask to meet me solo.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.950
I should get going. If I'm late
to school, my mom will hit the roof.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.327
Wait, before you go,

01:17.410 --> 01:19.496
you were just joking
about Disney World too, right?

01:19.788 --> 01:20.914
Thanks for the breakfast.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.679
Hey, Rosie!

01:38.348 --> 01:41.267
Things went well with Kayla?
The Rosewood smile is in full effect.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.603
The Rosewood smile
is always in effect, even at night.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.605
It's like a lighthouse guiding ships.

01:45.688 --> 01:47.148
So she went easy on you?

01:47.565 --> 01:50.735
Yeah, she went easy on me, and you
should take a page out of her book.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.529
Why? Because I give you
such a hard time?

01:52.612 --> 01:55.490
No, not me, Adrian. What, he's
asked you out like, four times?

01:55.573 --> 01:56.908
How and why do you know that?

01:56.991 --> 01:58.118
Because that's what I do, Villa.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.495
I wear cool pocket squares
and I know things.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.497
Except for why you won't
go out with Adrian.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.583
Listen, you deserve to be happy.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.753
There's no reason why that happiness
shouldn't start right now.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.130
Hey, guys.

02:10.296 --> 02:12.298
I double checked the forensics
from your investigation.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.968
-Tell us you found something new.
-I could, but it'd be a lie.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.594
The original lab techs were right.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.850
Another dead end.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.936
Case feels like a maze with no exit.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.104
That's why I popped by.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.190
I think I may have found some people
who can help us find a way out.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.863
Neat handwriting.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.447
Where's Professor Brenner?

02:36.656 --> 02:38.992
Getting some sun on South Beach
if he's doin' it right.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.036
I asked him if I could sub
for a few days.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.539
I am Dr. Beaumont Rosewood.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.958
Some call me the Beethoven
of private pathologists.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.126
No one calls you that.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.295
I am Detective Analise Villa.

02:50.461 --> 02:51.629
We have a special partnership

02:51.713 --> 02:53.715
that involves
a good amount of crime solving.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.885
Right now we're re-investigating
an old case, but we've hit a wall.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.345
Big one, I'm talking
like 100 ft high wall

02:59.429 --> 03:01.598
made of ice, stone, maybe some magic.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.557
Game Of Thrones style.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.393
Your professor and Dr. Rosewood
go way back.

03:05.476 --> 03:06.644
He brags about you guys.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.105
Dr. Brennan calls you
the best and the brightest.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.566
So I thought why not call you in
for an assist.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.986
Star Lord, you have a question?

03:16.196 --> 03:19.073
Yeah, so what makes you guys'
partnership so special?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.577
I'm a pathologist and she's
a detective. We solve murder cases.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.454
Okay.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.999
You don't think a cop
working with a pathologist is special?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.710
-Not really.
-It is, the way we do it.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.796
-How exactly do you guys do it?
-Well, we keep it real.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.382
In the lab and in the field.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.261
Because to me, forensic pathology
is not just about how the victim died.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.056
It's also about how they lived.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.725
They're dead, how they lived
shouldn't impact the autopsy.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.101
But it does.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.646
Who the victim was often reveals
how they died.

03:49.812 --> 03:53.524
-Where have I seen you?
-Nowhere, I have one of those faces.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.611
When you ID suspects for a living,
you don't forget faces.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.405
Yeah, and our names, forget about it.
Have you seen Memento? That's her.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.699
I got it, you're from the tabloids.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.785
The Kim Kardashian wanna be.

04:03.868 --> 04:07.538
I am... I aced my MCATs.
I'm not that person any more.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.123
The look you're rockin'
says otherwise.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.542
You feel like a Lil' Kim to me.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.128
I'm sorry, can we go back to the part
where you say you read tabloid magazines?

04:14.212 --> 04:15.505
No, but we can move on.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.799
Okay, since we're going
off syllabus, can I go?

04:17.882 --> 04:20.593
I'm a plastic surgery guy,
this is just an elective for me.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.346
Not only is that a no, Nip-Tuck...

04:24.347 --> 04:27.308
...but I'm gonna stay right here
and make sure you soak it all in.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.268
Okay.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.478
If that goes well, I might
invite you over, later.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.940
Just leave the gun, makes you
look scary, and not in a good way.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.109
Before she ends you, focus.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.278
We need everyone.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.781
Because our hope is that one of you
see something that we didn't.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.493
And together we can catch a killer.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.330
Unless your vision is impaired
how can we see something you didn't?

04:49.497 --> 04:51.374
Please forgive Robo Doc.

04:52.959 --> 04:53.835
"Robo Doc"?

04:53.918 --> 04:55.920
My classmates find me
overly logical and literal.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.506
Nice. Robo Doc, well done, everyone.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.842
Yeah, you go for it.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.720
It's Lara, what makes you think
we can help?

05:03.803 --> 05:06.472
Each of you has a unique perspective.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.643
Every voice matters and that's why
I like to investigate these cases.

05:10.727 --> 05:14.063
Because I hate it
when someone's voice gets silenced.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.524
Like our victim.

05:17.442 --> 05:21.279
You're scared, I get it.
You got nothing to worry about.

05:21.362 --> 05:22.530
What do I always say?

05:22.613 --> 05:24.907
The only people who matter
are the ones on the field.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.660
We're a team and this team
is all you'll ever need.

05:27.910 --> 05:28.745
- Come on, girl.
- Okay?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.580
-Come on, get out there, let's go.
-Okay.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.041
Her name, Elena Santiago.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.669
Elena was a force of nature
with her whole life ahead of her.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.422
But someone cut that life short.

05:41.591 --> 05:45.553
Every case affects me but when
the victim on my table is a child,

05:45.928 --> 05:47.513
it keeps me up at night.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.268
I have questions about Elena's murder.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.271
But the odds are stacked against us

05:55.355 --> 05:58.274
because it's been several years
since she was murdered.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.403
Elena Santiago.
The life that she lived

06:02.528 --> 06:06.115
and the life that was taken.
That's why we're here.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.043
- This is the case you're working on?
- Yes.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.171
And as pathologists,
we cannot shy away from the details.

06:20.963 --> 06:24.509
No matter how hard it is,
people depend on us for answers.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.970
Elena's father
is a Panamanian diplomat.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.516
He married an American woman
and Elena was their only child.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.811
To re-investigate Elena's murder
we need to exhume her body.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.230
You guys do that a lot.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.565
You give each other looks as if
you're trying to speak telepathically

06:39.649 --> 06:41.943
which to be clear is impossible.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.903
The look is about the parents.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.988
They said no to the exhumation,
I assume.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.117
Elena's death
was years ago,

06:49.450 --> 06:51.869
our family has healed
and we've moved on.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.081
Mrs. Santiago,
if Elena's killer is still out there,

06:55.164 --> 06:57.291
he could be doing this to other girls.

06:59.710 --> 07:00.837
Listen, we're not trying to upset you,

07:00.920 --> 07:03.548
we just want to make sure there were
no mistakes made during Elena's case.

07:03.631 --> 07:07.301
The only mistake we made
was letting you into our home.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.053
Now please leave.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.058
Is it just me
or is the dad guilty as sin?

07:14.142 --> 07:15.601
It's just you.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.020
I don't see how a father
can murder his own child.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.648
-Plus, no proof.
-Well, his reaction is proof.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.484
His response was natural,
he was a father still in grief.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.570
His grief sounds like guilt to me.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.572
Word on the street is that
he has a drug business.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.906
But again, no proof.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.492
Maybe Elena learned something
she shouldn't have and gets iced.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.745
-Intriguing idea.
-Sad is the right word choice here.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.874
Okay, maybe it's not about Carlos
maybe Elena was into something.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.750
That got her killed? She was 17.

07:39.834 --> 07:43.463
If you weren't getting into trouble
at 17, you weren't doing it right.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.381
Do we look like that when we argue?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.674
No, but I prefer quarreling.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.926
-Argue, quarrel, same thing.
-Quarrel has more panache.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.636
Really? We're gonna
get into an argument

07:50.720 --> 07:53.097
about what word
we should use to say we're arguing?

07:53.181 --> 07:55.099
-Quarreling. Quarreling.
-Arguing.

07:55.183 --> 07:58.603
It's all right, everyone.
I love your passion and your fire.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.688
It's nice. But the key
to solving this case

08:00.771 --> 08:03.441
is gonna be on your debates
as you look at every angle.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.694
You'll retrace our steps and those
of the original investigators.

08:06.777 --> 08:07.945
We're dividing you into two groups.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.157
Team Villa will comb through
every bit of evidence.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.993
Team Rosie is gonna look back
through Elena's body.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.913
-But we don't have Elena's body.
-That's not exactly true.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.920
We scanned in Elena's autopsy results

08:24.003 --> 08:27.465
giving us a virtual interactive 3D
replica of her body.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.851
Now who wants to be on Team Rosie?

09:01.832 --> 09:04.710
- My idea seems to be working.
- Why? Because they look determined?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.255
Come on, you have to admit,
it's a good idea.

09:07.338 --> 09:11.175
This was a not terrible idea.
On a scale of one to 10, this is a--

09:11.259 --> 09:12.301
-Ten.
-Divided by two.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.136
Is five times two is ten.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.639
We'll see how jazzed you are
when my team cracks the case.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.182
Okay, Villa, this isn't
a competition, okay?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.226
I hate even using Team Rosie
and Team Villa.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.603
Which was your idea,
but you know what?

09:22.853 --> 09:24.480
I bet I can be
less competitive than you.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.857
-I'll take that bet.
-Fine.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.612
Team Rosie, what were our findings
from our virtual autopsy?

09:31.696 --> 09:32.905
Let's start with her head.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.658
We saw brain tissue
with old eschemic damage.

09:35.741 --> 09:39.120
Elena has heavy ligature marks from
repeated strangulation with a rope.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.581
We found several rib fractures.

09:41.664 --> 09:45.251
Strangulation deprives her of oxygen
causing the brain tissue death

09:45.334 --> 09:46.377
which leads us to believe--

09:46.460 --> 09:48.754
She was brought
to the brink of death repeatedly.

09:51.507 --> 09:55.011
And then revived each time with CPR
resulting in the rib fractures.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.976
It was a precise and brutal murder

10:02.059 --> 10:04.979
which tells us our killer
wanted to inflict pain.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.398
This will be "He" as we develop
a psychological profile.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.025
Team me, you're up.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.401
We cross referenced
Elena's inner circle

10:10.484 --> 10:12.278
with police interviews
from the original case.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.738
The cops missed somebody.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.449
Jody Carwell, she was abroad
at the time of the murder.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.617
Exchange program.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.744
According to the message
she left in Elena's yearbook,

10:19.827 --> 10:20.786
they were close friends.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.247
Although it's been a decade,
she might have some useful info.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.999
We came to the same conclusion
you guys did.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.418
Jody Carwell was our only new lead.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.587
So we paid her a visit.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.717
Elena never said anything
about her father's work.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.761
She was just desperate
to spend time with him.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.347
-How was their relationship?
-Nonexistent.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.515
He was emotionally distant.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.644
She only got into soccer
because he loved it.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.520
Thought it would make them closer
and it didn't.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.773
Word is, you, Elena
and the other girls

10:48.856 --> 10:50.900
on the soccer team
were the school's Mean Girls.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.693
We weren't Mean Girls.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.571
We gave constructive criticism
to the girls who needed it.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.864
There's nothing wrong with that.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.408
So you were just providing
a public service?

10:59.825 --> 11:00.826
Yeah.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.704
These girls need my wisdom,
that's why I came back to coach.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.331
Is that what you tell yourself?

11:05.623 --> 11:07.458
See, okay, let me
break this down for you.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.252
Was there anyone on this team
who was jealous of Elena?

11:10.336 --> 11:11.879
Like you, for example.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.839
Did you ever want your shot
at being Queen Bee?

11:14.423 --> 11:17.802
No, because none of us
could fill Elena's shoes.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.137
She was loved and feared.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.640
That's why we didn't question her
letting Misty on the team.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.141
What was your problem with Misty?

11:24.225 --> 11:27.228
She was the kind of girl
we gave constructive criticism to.

11:27.770 --> 11:32.650
She was sweet
and there is nothing worse than that.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.235
I can think of one thing.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.153
Rosie, what's the problem with fear?

11:36.237 --> 11:37.655
Well, cliff notes, it activates

11:37.738 --> 11:39.865
a fight or flight response
in the limbic system.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.076
Anything you experience
while afraid is deemed negative.

11:42.159 --> 11:45.788
Translation, you can't be loved
by those who fear you.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.999
You just end up alone,
longing for the glory days,

11:49.083 --> 11:50.501
but I guess you already know that.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.131
Girls!

11:55.589 --> 11:56.757
What was that?

11:56.841 --> 11:59.802
I can't help it.
Ceviche and Mean Girls.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.680
-Things you hate?
-Things I love served raw.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.644
First inference is pathology.
So let's break this down.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.564
Elena was a popular girl.
Misty, not so much.

12:11.647 --> 12:14.316
So why would an Elena let a Misty
into her clique?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.318
-I know mean girls.
-Because you are a mean girl?

12:16.402 --> 12:18.112
Because I was a mean girl.

12:18.195 --> 12:21.615
My guess is that Misty blackmailed
her way to the cool kids' table.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.534
In my experience,
bullies have secrets.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.412
It's possible that Elena had one
that got her killed.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.290
Team Villa, do we buy this theory
or do we think that it's--

12:29.373 --> 12:30.624
Garbage.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.294
Detective, we're finishing
each other's sentences.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.671
You know I'm warming up to you.
Are you...

12:35.755 --> 12:37.173
No, not even a little.

12:37.506 --> 12:41.260
Okay, we went through Elena's emails,
there's no mention of a secret.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.721
Sorry. Thanks for playing, Team Rosie.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.265
We're not gonna take that, are we?

12:46.348 --> 12:48.350
No. What about her bank statements?

12:48.684 --> 12:50.227
Yeah, we looked at those too.
There's no...

12:50.311 --> 12:53.147
Actually I found itemized receipts
for charges for pre-natal vitamins.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.733
No one in Elena's life
mentioned a pregnancy.

12:55.816 --> 12:59.403
Probably because it's a...
Wait for it, a secret.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.281
-Point, Team Rosie.
-Why didn't you mention this before?

13:02.364 --> 13:05.367
-No one asked.
-But what should you be asking now?

13:05.868 --> 13:08.913
There was no evidence of a pregnancy
on Elena's autopsy, so...

13:09.497 --> 13:11.123
Why did she buy
the pre-natal vitamins?

13:11.207 --> 13:12.625
'Cause they weren't for her,
they were for a friend

13:12.708 --> 13:14.543
so the secret wasn't hers,
it was theirs.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.878
We'll take that point back now.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.255
Unless Team Rosie has something
they'd like to add.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.882
Team Rosie, look at me.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.301
The absence of evidence
doesn't mean it's not there.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.220
Just means it's in a good hiding spot.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.432
You're giving hints now?

13:28.516 --> 13:30.351
-You gave one.
-I gave one, so you gave one?

13:30.434 --> 13:31.685
What happened to not competing?

13:31.769 --> 13:33.813
We're not, we're aggressively
shaping young minds.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.022
We found something.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.316
There's a parturition scar
on her pelvis.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.277
It's so small we
and the original MEs missed it.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.988
Elena was pregnant
just not at the time of death.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.908
Makes sense. She bought the vitamins
two months before the TOD.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.661
-Dude, stop helping them.
-I like it, very good job. Good job.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.871
That's what I'm talking about.
Okay now we're competing.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.999
And we have a new person of interest.
The baby daddy.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.627
Elena was dating a jock.
Vos Derra.

13:56.710 --> 13:59.839
If she was being blackmailed
she'd wanna put a stop to it.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.423
And the fastest way to do that
would be--

14:01.507 --> 14:02.800
Come clean about the baby.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.510
And what if Vos didn't want that?

14:04.593 --> 14:06.804
I assume you two
have spoken with Vos already.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.097
Where did you find him?

14:09.181 --> 14:12.434
I dated Elena on and off
in high school. What about it?

14:12.518 --> 14:15.312
-Did you know about her pregnancy?
-Keep your back straight!

14:15.396 --> 14:16.814
Yeah, I knew.

14:17.481 --> 14:18.732
What happened to the baby?

14:20.276 --> 14:22.820
Vos, we don't seem to be getting
your full attention.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.238
So you can either focus
on our question--

14:24.363 --> 14:27.157
Trust me, you don't want her
to finish that sentence.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.617
Sorry, it's just...

14:29.535 --> 14:30.953
This isn't easy to talk about.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.830
It's why I didn't tell the cops
about the pregnancy.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.082
I just couldn't go there.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.959
Well, we need you to go there.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.837
-What happened to the baby?
-Elena miscarried.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.381
Few months later,
she dumped me for an older guy.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.300
What do you know about him?

14:44.383 --> 14:47.845
Nothing. But whoever he was,
Misty had a thing for him, too.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.182
Who was the mystery crush?

14:52.433 --> 14:54.226
-You tell us.
-We don't have enough information

14:54.310 --> 14:56.645
-to deduce his identity.
-Then you should do what we did.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.439
Keep digging. Look at everyone.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.859
What about Vos? As the jilted lover
he's gotta be a suspect.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.778
Plus he has the physical strength to
inflict the kind of pain that we saw.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.572
The police cleared him.

15:06.655 --> 15:07.907
It's more likely
that Misty killed Elena

15:07.990 --> 15:10.200
to eliminate competition
for their crush's affections.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.161
That's a stretch.
A girl Misty's height and weight

15:12.244 --> 15:13.746
wouldn't be able to cause
these ligature marks.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.539
With a little planning,
I could do that.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.833
- Don't say things like that anymore.
- Sorry.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.878
Why don't you just tell us
what Misty had to say for herself?

15:21.962 --> 15:24.131
-We didn't talk to Misty.
-Why not?

15:25.090 --> 15:26.300
Because Misty's dead, too.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.679
She was taken two days after
Elena's body was found.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.599
Misty and Elena
went to the same school,

15:33.682 --> 15:35.935
are the same age,
lived in the same community.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.604
Are we looking
at a serial killer here?

15:39.605 --> 15:40.856
I believe we are.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.613
It's hard
being the nerd in school.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.699
Kids can be so mean.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.494
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.125
I couldn't wait
to get out of high school.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.711
I just wish that Misty
had a chance to see

16:02.795 --> 16:04.296
that there's so much more, you know.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.342
I need a favor.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.804
Can you cover for me tonight?
I have a thing.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.139
Nice. Like a studio session?

16:14.223 --> 16:16.725
'Cause maybe I can come after
and split some beans.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.435
No.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.314
So what? You have like a date thing?

16:22.523 --> 16:25.734
Is that weird? I mean, I know
you're dating too, so...

16:25.818 --> 16:28.362
Yeah, no, I am. It's not weird.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.698
So yeah, I will cover you.

16:31.865 --> 16:32.700
Cool.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.253
Misty's mom again?

16:45.087 --> 16:47.297
It's not like you to avoid
a victim's loved one.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.260
Lynn calls me
every day for an update

16:51.343 --> 16:54.054
and every day I have to tell her
that I don't have any answers.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.724
Then you keep searching.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.351
Misty and Elena's killer
is still out there.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.270
Or I forced two families
to relive the worst thing

17:01.353 --> 17:03.731
that's ever happened
to them for nothing.

17:05.399 --> 17:08.402
This is really taking a toll on you,
I'm sorry.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.989
It's not just this case, is it?

17:13.240 --> 17:16.035
Misty and Elena, they weren't
that much older than Kayla.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.913
So it's hard not to think about her

17:19.997 --> 17:21.749
and what it will do to Tawnya
if she ever lost her.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.336
Is that why you've gotten
attached so quickly?

17:26.420 --> 17:28.756
I know my relationship with Tawnya
doesn't make sense on paper.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.090
I get that.

17:30.966 --> 17:31.884
But I'm willing to see where it goes

17:31.967 --> 17:34.178
without any fears
and without any regrets.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.347
Then I support you, son.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.975
And as for Misty's mom,

17:40.059 --> 17:43.479
you just remind her that you are
fighting for her baby.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.567
Ready for lunch and more shopping
than our credit cards can handle.

17:48.692 --> 17:49.902
You bet.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.161
Thank you for the update.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.835
Dr. Rosewood, are these the students
you were talking about?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.295
Just a few.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.881
This is Misty's mom, Lynn.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.717
Thank you so much
for everything you're doing.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.469
I can't tell you how much it means.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.765
We've been studying Misty's case.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.559
But it just tells us
what happened, not who she was.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.979
Can you maybe
fill in the blanks for us?

18:31.902 --> 18:33.946
Misty loved the color red and

18:34.363 --> 18:36.240
Fall Out Boy and watching TV.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.117
She said we were the Gilmore Girls.

18:39.034 --> 18:42.079
Hmm...
She was so special.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.499
Not every 17 year old could turn
her bully into her best friend.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.793
I don't get it. Why would Misty
friend Elena

18:47.876 --> 18:50.629
when the pain bullies cause
doesn't just go away.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.967
Misty understood Elena caused pain
because she was in pain.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.177
They both had absent fathers.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.721
Misty refused to
let the past haunt her.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.516
I wish I could live like that.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.936
Palm Acres was supposed to be
the kind of place

19:06.019 --> 19:08.689
a mother didn't have to worry
about her child making it home.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.608
And now all I do is worry.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.902
I have two boys now
and every time they leave the house...

19:18.073 --> 19:22.452
Misty was stubborn, like her mom.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.124
And she never gave up on anyone, so...

19:29.626 --> 19:31.920
Thank you for not giving up on her.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.722
So when you asked us
to come in early...

19:41.805 --> 19:43.891
I wanted you guys
to meet Misty's mother.

19:44.099 --> 19:44.975
Because what we do--

19:45.058 --> 19:46.685
It's not just about our victims.

19:46.852 --> 19:47.978
It's about their families, too.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.105
You knew we'd ask her
about Misty.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.982
'Cause you guys
are my star students.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.693
And I'm also a great teacher.

19:57.070 --> 20:00.616
So TMI, is that your real
name or a Detective Villa special?

20:00.699 --> 20:04.077
It's actually a term of endearment
unlike Nip-Tuck. Ouch.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.954
Well, I've been called worse.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.581
Welcome to Magic City Lab.

20:07.748 --> 20:11.627
I invited you here today
to examine the body of Misty Spencer.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.630
This is your chance to find something
Dr. Rosewood missed.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.006
He hates when people show him up.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.758
No, you can't hate what rarely happens.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.509
So please find something.

20:20.177 --> 20:23.138
The only chance to find the killer
is right here in front of you.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.652
Misty's body was found in the woods.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.488
It was raining that night
so trace evidence is non-existent.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.823
I see ligature marks.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.576
Yeah, but they're lighter
than the ones found on Elena.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.788
And down here we got horizontal cuts
in her hand.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.166
-May I?
-Yes.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.129
Multiple stab wounds
on her upper back and shoulders.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.965
Blisters at the same location.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.467
The only common injury
with both victims

21:00.550 --> 21:02.094
are the ligature marks.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.638
What does that tell you?

21:14.523 --> 21:17.359
Team Rosie thinks we're not looking
for a serial killer after all.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.694
And Team Rosie would be wrong.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.697
Misty's mother said she was a fighter.
Team Villa thinks she got away.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.700
The stab wounds were at a downward
angle and were randomly distributed.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.034
She was running when she got him.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.370
Which makes sense why
Misty's ligature marks are lighter.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.707
Killer never had a chance to strangle
and resuscitate her over and over.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.916
Point Team Villa.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.377
I want everyone
to review Misty's autopsy report.

21:36.211 --> 21:38.005
Then we'll reconvene here
in 20 minutes.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.970
I'm not sure I can handle
all these mini Rosies being released

21:45.053 --> 21:47.306
out into the wild once they graduate.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.850
Well, original recipe Rosie will help
see you through it.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.852
Was that the first time you've used
the original recipe, Rosie?

21:51.935 --> 21:53.854
-Yep. Yeah.
-Can it be the last?

21:54.771 --> 21:57.733
You know
if you'd gone out with Adrian--

21:57.816 --> 22:00.193
When your mom gets all up in
your business, what do you tell her?

22:00.277 --> 22:01.445
-Stay in your lane.
-You should do that.

22:01.528 --> 22:02.404
No, can do.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.866
Rosewoods don't stay on our lanes.
We make lane changes, so you ready?

22:06.199 --> 22:07.701
-I'm signaling.
-I'm not letting you over.

22:07.784 --> 22:08.785
Well, I'll just get behind you.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.705
You know what? Focus on fixing
your own love life.

22:11.788 --> 22:12.873
Nothing to fix.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.792
-Tawnya and I are just fine.
-Maybe not so much with Kayla.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.837
Your meet and greet didn't go
as well as you think.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.380
Evidence, por favor?

22:20.464 --> 22:24.676
Growing up, I grilled every guy
my mom brought home.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.345
I had to know
if they were good enough.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.014
But the ones I didn't think
would stick around,

22:29.348 --> 22:31.558
I played nice until they were gone.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.394
-So I should want her to hate me?
-Yes.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.854
Don't try to understand it.

22:36.229 --> 22:38.607
Rosie, I'm going to lunch.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.026
And your rosebuds have a new theory.

22:41.902 --> 22:45.364
Rosebuds? I like it. That's a strong
nick name. You better watch out.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.990
-Can I call you Rosebud?
-No.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.910
-No? Rosebud.
-No. No.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.622
-After some discussion--
-And a vote, I was against.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.415
We decided to join forces.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.501
And call ourselves Team Rosilla.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.086
That sounds like a nick name
for us.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.296
You should keep your day job.
What do you got?

23:01.797 --> 23:02.964
Since Misty was found in the woods,

23:03.048 --> 23:04.466
it led us to theorize
that she and Elena

23:04.549 --> 23:06.968
-were held in a cabin nearby.
-We had the same thought.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.638
The original investigators
searched the area

23:09.721 --> 23:11.765
but they were looking
in the wrong part of the woods.

23:21.358 --> 23:22.609
We think the blisters
on Misty's back

23:22.692 --> 23:23.944
are from manchineel trees.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.198
They are indigenous to the woods
and extremely toxic.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.619
Standing under the tree
during rainfall

23:32.702 --> 23:34.329
caused blistering from contact
with the sap.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.918
We think that Misty was exposed
when she was running away.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.378
We started taking X Rays.

23:41.461 --> 23:45.090
We noticed dense metophysio lines
in Misty's arm.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.759
Which were undetectable
with X Ray technology ten years ago.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.428
The lines indicate lead poisoning.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.513
Lead poisoning
in the middle of the woods.

23:51.596 --> 23:54.808
-How do you explain that?
-Two words. Underground bunker.

24:01.148 --> 24:04.818
We think that Misty and Elena
were held in a bunker in the woods.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.281
There are a number
of abandoned bunkers

24:09.364 --> 24:11.533
from the Cuban Missile Crisis
around Florida.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.423
All of the evidence
that we found points to the man

24:26.506 --> 24:27.966
who was convicted of the murders.

24:28.758 --> 24:29.926
The soccer coach.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.012
Gerald Kelly.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.141
Gerald Kelly has been imprisoned
for ten years for the murders.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.809
He's the reason why we've come to you.

24:37.893 --> 24:41.021
My family thinks he's innocent.
Twelve jurors found him guilty.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.482
But I am not so sure.

24:44.608 --> 24:48.195
And I hate to admit it but I've lost
perspective on this case.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.115
I need all of you
to help me get it back.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.620
Meet me in your classroom in one hour.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.004
I don't know if you noticed,

25:06.087 --> 25:08.340
but Detective Villa and I,
we have a thing.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.468
We've noticed.
There are memes about you two now.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.972
Our thing works because we each bring
something to the table.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.933
Yes, I serve a mean dish of pathology.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.935
And upto this point,
we've been able to paint

25:20.018 --> 25:21.394
a clear picture
of who our victims were.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.230
And investigation is my thing.

25:23.313 --> 25:26.358
And now we're gonna use it to paint
a picture of the alleged killer.

25:27.025 --> 25:30.529
We're going to lay out
a case against Gerald Kelly.

25:31.613 --> 25:35.534
Durbined, double braided sizer rope
was used to strangle our victim.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.619
Same type of rope that was found
in Gerald's garage.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.538
As I'm sure a lot of people do.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.373
It only matters that he had it.

25:41.456 --> 25:44.918
Gerald was Misty and Elena's coach.
They trusted him.

25:45.001 --> 25:47.921
And he could've used that trust as
a means to lure them to the bunker.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.756
A witness placed Gerald at the scene

25:50.048 --> 25:51.758
where Misty Spencer's body
was discovered.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.427
In 78% of overturned cases,

25:54.511 --> 25:57.931
mistaken or flawed identification was
a critical component in conviction.

25:58.014 --> 26:01.059
Yeah, you can't
trust witnesses or alibis.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.228
Speaking of, did Gerald have one?

26:03.311 --> 26:06.356
No, he said he was at home alone
when the murders were committed.

26:06.439 --> 26:09.734
Palm Acres is home to the most
powerful residents in Miami,

26:09.818 --> 26:11.736
which is why the FBI got involved.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.072
Their DNA experts found

26:14.155 --> 26:17.284
perhaps the most
damning evidence against Gerald.

26:17.617 --> 26:19.494
A blood stain on Misty's jeans.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.789
The lab alleged a low level
contaminate made it into the sample

26:22.872 --> 26:25.792
thus resulting in only
a partial profile that matches Gerald.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.836
All of this evidence
is circumstantial,

26:27.919 --> 26:29.588
yet this man was sent away for life.

26:29.671 --> 26:32.674
-So what was the ace in the hole here?
-Gerald was.

26:33.258 --> 26:36.553
The DA argued that Gerald abused women
when he was younger.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.471
That continued into adulthood

26:38.555 --> 26:42.809
and led to the murders
of Misty and Elena.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.770
Charged with
disturbing the peace at 16

26:45.854 --> 26:48.732
and accused
of beating his girlfriend at 25.

26:48.815 --> 26:51.192
Those accusations were expunged
when she recanted.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.195
-Probably because he threatened her.
-Do you see any evidence of that?

26:54.321 --> 26:55.822
I... I don't.

26:55.905 --> 26:57.490
But it no doubt biased the jury.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.200
See how fast you hopped on
Team Guilty.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.703
As a woman
you're joining Team Innocent

27:01.786 --> 27:03.079
with a man who hits women.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.205
As a woman I know what it's like

27:04.289 --> 27:06.249
to have the world say
and believe the worst about you.

27:06.499 --> 27:08.752
Look, the fact is,
allegedly having a temper

27:08.835 --> 27:10.795
and having the capacity
to murder someone

27:10.879 --> 27:11.796
are two very different things.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.592
Well not according to the DA. He linked
Gerald's alleged history of violence

27:15.675 --> 27:17.969
to the disappearance
of his daughter, Michelle Kelly.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.846
Michelle was a troubled kid.

27:20.722 --> 27:23.099
She was prone to petty theft
and truancy.

27:23.183 --> 27:26.811
She took off six months before the
murders and hasn't been seen since.

27:26.895 --> 27:29.564
I assume samples were taken
from Mr. Kelly during processing.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.774
But what about the video?

27:34.694 --> 27:36.613
There are two type of people
who enter your lab.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.741
One who walks in
and the other will be wheeled in.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.118
You need to be able to read both.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.829
What did the police miss
with Gerald Kelly?

27:45.455 --> 27:46.831
His lymph nodes appear swollen...

27:46.915 --> 27:49.709
which could indicate an allergic
reaction to mold in the bunker.

27:49.793 --> 27:54.839
Or he has a cold or a sore throat
or any number of things

27:54.923 --> 27:56.174
that don't place him in that bunker.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.300
I agree.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.513
What happened to shopping?

28:01.846 --> 28:02.722
Two things I know.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.432
When my children
are trying to get rid of me

28:04.516 --> 28:06.351
and how to get them to tell me why.

28:07.519 --> 28:11.439
I'd like to introduce you
to Donna Rosewood. She's my mother.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.399
She's here--

28:12.482 --> 28:15.735
To observe as a close friend
of Gerald Kelly's.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.028
Please continue.

28:19.322 --> 28:21.491
There's a reddish hue
in the whites of his eyes.

28:21.950 --> 28:25.954
-Could be drunk.
-Or crying over his missing daughter

28:26.037 --> 28:28.790
or maybe he's in shock
at having just been arrested

28:28.873 --> 28:30.709
for the murder of two girls
he cared about.

28:30.875 --> 28:32.544
I thought observe meant
to watch and to listen.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.546
I'm sorry, you're right, you're right.

28:35.255 --> 28:38.091
He's quiet. An innocent man
proclaims his innocence.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.260
Or he knows he's being filmed.

28:40.677 --> 28:43.722
And anything he says can be used
against him in a court of law.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.892
What about those blisters?

28:47.976 --> 28:50.562
Gerald testified
that he burned himself cooking.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.357
Guys, you're talking
to the future of plastic surgery here.

28:54.441 --> 28:58.486
I know skin, those are not burns,
those are blisters.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.488
And I bet they match
the manchineel tree blisters

29:00.572 --> 29:01.823
we found on our second victim.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.493
The manchineel blisters mean
that Gerald was at the crime scene.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.166
Mom, this isn't good.

29:16.045 --> 29:16.880
Mom.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.633
Mom, I'm sorry, but I just proo--

29:20.717 --> 29:22.135
You haven't proven anything.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.845
Why are you calling it a day

29:23.928 --> 29:26.473
with what looks like blisters
on a video?

29:26.556 --> 29:28.224
I've done everything that I can
to uncover the truth.

29:28.308 --> 29:32.312
Okay, then do this one last thing.
For me.

29:34.189 --> 29:37.108
Ask Gerald if he was
in the woods that night

29:37.192 --> 29:39.694
and if after that,
you're still convinced

29:39.778 --> 29:41.488
that he committed those awful crimes

29:41.571 --> 29:46.451
then I will never mention
his name again.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.455
Okay. I'll do that.

30:01.132 --> 30:06.179
I hope that white pocket square
isn't a symbol of your surrendering.

30:06.387 --> 30:07.430
I came for answers.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.724
And I came for you.

30:11.309 --> 30:17.607
So Gerald, tell me again what you were
doing the night of October 21st, 2006?

30:19.442 --> 30:20.652
You read the file.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.988
Yeah, I did read the file and you said

30:24.072 --> 30:25.865
that you were at home
cooking yourself dinner.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.326
But that's not
the complete story, is it?

30:30.453 --> 30:33.289
Manchineel sap is very painful.

30:34.833 --> 30:38.711
That's why they limit their growth
to a certain section of the woods.

30:38.837 --> 30:42.799
Appears like a flamethrower
just charring the skin.

30:45.468 --> 30:46.636
Would you agree?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.392
You were in the woods
that night, weren't you?

31:03.403 --> 31:04.362
I was there.

31:15.915 --> 31:18.585
So help me
understand something, Gerald.

31:19.419 --> 31:22.005
Elena and Misty,
two girls that you coached

31:22.630 --> 31:24.299
were brutally murdered
and all of the evidence

31:24.382 --> 31:25.383
pointed to you.

31:25.633 --> 31:26.801
But yet you lied to us

31:26.885 --> 31:28.887
about being in the woods
that night that Misty was found.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.222
Why shouldn't we just
walk out of here right now?

31:31.306 --> 31:33.016
Because I want to hear
what he has to say.

31:35.768 --> 31:38.771
I believed in you
when no one else would.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.775
I got my family involved.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.529
Why would you keep this from me?

31:53.703 --> 31:56.831
It's the same reason
I kept it from the police.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.585
Because just being
in the woods that night

32:02.045 --> 32:05.048
it just makes me seem guilty.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.217
-No matter what I was doing.
-So why were you there?

32:11.054 --> 32:12.472
I was looking for my daughter.

32:16.851 --> 32:19.604
I had put up posters that week.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.483
Everywhere.

32:25.068 --> 32:28.488
And that night somebody
called the tip line and they said

32:28.571 --> 32:29.572
that there was a girl in the park

32:29.656 --> 32:32.367
that looked just like Michelle,
in the woods.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.535
So I went.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.746
But you didn't find her.

32:38.706 --> 32:39.582
No.

32:41.834 --> 32:47.548
She had become depressed and angry
and I tried to help her

32:48.383 --> 32:50.802
in all kinds of ways
but I just couldn't.

32:52.929 --> 32:56.808
And then it wasn't just Michelle,
I lost my whole family.

33:01.020 --> 33:05.024
They said I was to blame
for Michelle running away.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.029
And then Elena and Misty...

33:11.197 --> 33:13.449
And I was accused of killing them.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.455
I am sorry.

33:21.582 --> 33:22.542
I'm sorry.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.389
Sady?

33:36.848 --> 33:39.434
Oh, my gosh.
My inbox has been allergic

33:39.517 --> 33:41.269
to text messages lately,
it's so weird.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.229
-Did we have plans?
-No.

33:43.771 --> 33:46.441
Actually I didn't know you'd be
anywhere near here.

33:47.608 --> 33:50.528
-So you're here because--
-We're going out tonight.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.780
And we went out last week.

33:54.073 --> 33:56.409
Yeah. I'm gonna go wait downstairs.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.456
Yeah.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.624
So...

34:05.084 --> 34:06.544
-Tinder?
-Bumble.

34:07.378 --> 34:08.671
What got you?

34:08.838 --> 34:13.342
She loves art, has a great sense
of humor, good taste in music.

34:13.426 --> 34:16.429
-It was the pic in the strapless.
-Yeah.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.724
I loves me shoulders.

34:20.808 --> 34:22.894
Yeah, this dating thing is hard.

34:22.977 --> 34:24.228
Tell me about it.

34:26.105 --> 34:28.232
-You're a tough act to follow.
-So are you.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.111
But go, go, have fun.

34:32.528 --> 34:33.738
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

34:36.824 --> 34:37.825
Okay.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.368
But don't forget your wallet.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.537
She likes to go Dutch?

34:41.621 --> 34:44.457
No, she likes to go, "I can't pay
anything at all, thanks."

34:51.798 --> 34:53.716
You're gonna
dance circles around me.

34:53.966 --> 34:56.135
Well, spoiler alert,
ain't gonna happen.

34:57.470 --> 35:00.056
Okay. I'll see you Saturday.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.267
Decided to go out on a date
with Adrian, huh?

35:03.351 --> 35:04.685
I knew all you needed
was a little push.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.188
No push, this was my call.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.774
It felt like the right time,
so I asked.

35:09.857 --> 35:12.193
Come on, I gave you
the full Rosie push.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.612
-You gave me a fourth of a push.
-No, it was three quarters, easy.

35:15.571 --> 35:19.242
-Did you speak to Gerald?
-I did and I need your help.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.580
Dr. Rosewood.

35:25.957 --> 35:26.833
I hope you don't mind.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.752
Krista had to take off,
she said I could stick around.

35:29.877 --> 35:32.004
No, that's okay.
What can I help you with?

35:32.755 --> 35:35.716
Before I met you I couldn't care less
about forensic pathology.

35:36.342 --> 35:37.844
And now you're ready
to join the team.

35:37.927 --> 35:40.263
Well, let's just say I'm open
to playing the field.

35:40.763 --> 35:41.848
Okay. Why?

35:42.598 --> 35:45.643
Elena and Misty and Gerald.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.854
I thought I could put them
in my review, but...

35:47.937 --> 35:49.021
It's been bugging you.

35:49.981 --> 35:50.982
Yeah.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.025
Yeah, and that means something to me.

35:53.192 --> 35:55.653
I know I seem like the guy
that doesn't care about anyone

35:55.736 --> 35:57.572
or anything but I do.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.408
You didn't come all the way over here
to tell me that.

36:01.576 --> 36:02.660
You have a theory.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.289
I know I'm the guy that put Gerald
at the scene of the crime.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.458
-But I don't think he did it.
-Why not?

36:10.042 --> 36:13.004
In the video there were no wounds
or scabs on Gerald.

36:13.087 --> 36:15.381
So it got me thinking,
where did the blood come from?

36:15.464 --> 36:17.842
-What if it wasn't his?
-But it was his, it was a match.

36:17.925 --> 36:21.679
Partial match.
Half the genetic indicators.

36:21.762 --> 36:24.098
Because of the contamination
in the Forensics lab.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.392
The FBI admitted to some errors
in the fluid collection.

36:26.475 --> 36:27.977
But if the blood wasn't his

36:28.102 --> 36:30.605
that could also explain
the incomplete match.

36:39.655 --> 36:41.741
One hour on hold
with the phone company.

36:41.949 --> 36:44.744
Nip-Tuck.
You're here for extra credit?

36:45.203 --> 36:46.204
Only if you're giving it.

36:46.704 --> 36:47.955
He had a theory.

36:48.039 --> 36:51.000
I gave Dr. Rosewood
a light bulb moment.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.127
-Did he make the face?
-He made the face.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.839
Nicely done. And for that,
I need your real name.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.258
Brian.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.093
You know, maybe,
now that we're friends

37:01.177 --> 37:02.887
I can give you a nick name.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.310
Detective Villa works
just fine for me.

37:09.393 --> 37:13.898
So, Rosie, you wanna update the class?
What does the report say?

37:14.649 --> 37:16.067
We've been looking at it all wrong.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.454
Please, I do not
want to talk about Gerald.

37:28.537 --> 37:29.664
I wanna talk about him.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.583
We compared the blood on Misty's jeans
to another sample.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.418
Gerald's daughter, Michelle.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.921
The hair sample that we found
in the Missing Persons file

37:37.004 --> 37:38.256
was an exact genetic match.

37:38.714 --> 37:40.841
That's why the DNA
was only a partial match

37:40.925 --> 37:43.052
to Gerald, right family, wrong member.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.596
What? What are you saying?

37:45.680 --> 37:48.557
So either Michelle's the victim
or she's the killer.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.434
How did Misty's DNA get on her jeans?

37:50.518 --> 37:53.020
We don't know but I don't think
that Gerald killed his daughter.

37:53.312 --> 37:55.147
So you've joined the team?

37:55.231 --> 37:57.400
Oh! I need to have some jerseys made.

37:58.025 --> 38:00.194
-What finally changed your mind?
-Gerald.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.446
Just hearing him talking
about his daughter

38:02.530 --> 38:05.366
for the first time I saw him.

38:06.033 --> 38:08.327
So I retested the blood
and I had Villa do some digging.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.121
I was able to locate
cell tower records

38:10.204 --> 38:12.123
from the night Misty Spencer's body
was discovered.

38:12.206 --> 38:15.251
It shows that Gerald received a call
that night from an unregistered number

38:15.334 --> 38:17.920
and that call was made 30 miles away.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.964
There's no way the caller
saw Gerald's daughter.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.133
The DA could argue it was a friend
calling him.

38:22.216 --> 38:25.386
So I ran that number against EMPD
call logs from that night.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.055
Guess who called the desk sergeant
about a body in the woods?

38:28.472 --> 38:29.515
The same number.

38:29.598 --> 38:30.975
Someone lied to Gerald
to get him into the woods

38:31.058 --> 38:32.852
and then they called the police
to meet him there.

38:32.935 --> 38:34.353
They framed him.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.397
We're gonna solve this
and get Gerald out of prison.

38:42.069 --> 38:43.112
I know it's not easy

38:43.195 --> 38:45.156
when someone new
comes into your mother's life.

38:46.198 --> 38:48.242
Something in your gut
tells you not to trust him.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.536
-Maybe he's not a good guy.
-Or not worth her time.

38:50.703 --> 38:51.537
No offense.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.998
No, none taken, none taken.
I get it.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.459
I'm really protective
of my mother, too.

38:57.835 --> 39:01.047
You know, we could've had this convo
over a French vanilla latte.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.466
True, true, very true but I thought

39:03.549 --> 39:05.468
coming to your favorite spot
might be better.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.511
Rosewoods do our homework.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.890
I can't explain it,
but when I need to chill

39:10.973 --> 39:12.600
I come here, throw some shots and

39:13.559 --> 39:14.935
things are better.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.354
You up for a little one on one?

39:16.812 --> 39:18.481
I appreciate the offer
but I'll pass.

39:18.898 --> 39:19.815
You know,
you shouldn't let your asthma

39:19.899 --> 39:21.734
stop you from
a little friendly competition.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.444
How did you know I was an asthmatic?

39:23.527 --> 39:25.696
When you get excited
you reach for your pocket.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.866
Probably where you used to keep your
inhaler before you got your purse.

39:28.949 --> 39:30.326
It's an asthmatic's reflex.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.828
I can't even make it through the pain
without wheezing.

39:32.912 --> 39:36.040
Well, listen, our limitations
make us better, not worse.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.711
You might not be the one
to drive to the rim

39:40.795 --> 39:43.422
but it doesn't stop you from
trading threes like a boss.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.549
All right, I'm down.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.178
For every shot that I make you've got to
answer a question about yourself.

39:49.261 --> 39:51.097
I'm still not convinced
you're not a weirdo.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.641
I'm game, I'm game,
and I love the shake.

39:54.016 --> 39:55.810
-Up through.
-Yeah, yeah, I'm down, I'm down.

39:58.896 --> 39:59.980
All right.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.529
You know, after...

40:08.656 --> 40:11.367
...that last visit I didn't think
I was gonna see you again.

40:12.326 --> 40:13.744
Well, get used to seeing me.

40:14.453 --> 40:15.496
A lot.

40:16.247 --> 40:20.418
Because from now on, all of the
Rosewoods are on Team Gerald.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.256
We're gonna go back
through the evidence.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.758
Anything that could possibly
be related to your case.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.680
With the support of the EMPD,
we're gonna have access to

40:32.763 --> 40:36.809
every available resource to help
locate Misty and Elena's killers.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.604
We've gotten everything we can
off of Misty's body.

40:40.688 --> 40:43.774
but I need to examine
Elena's with my own eyes.

40:46.277 --> 40:50.197
Because her father won't consent to an
exhumation and he's hiding something,

40:51.615 --> 40:55.035
and that tells me that the key
to your release could be with Elena.

40:55.369 --> 40:57.788
Now, Gerald,
we need you to think back,

40:58.539 --> 41:00.708
think back to the days
leading up to your arrest.

41:00.791 --> 41:04.503
All the conversations with the girls,
with their teachers, the parents,

41:04.587 --> 41:05.963
or their coaches.

41:06.046 --> 41:07.923
Every little detail can be important.

41:09.425 --> 41:10.676
Because the killer knew you.

41:11.802 --> 41:12.887
He knew your personal history,

41:12.970 --> 41:15.848
he knew your relationship
with Misty and Elena.

41:18.058 --> 41:19.560
You were chosen, Gerald.

41:20.394 --> 41:23.481
My guess is that the killer
had been watching you for a long time.

41:25.524 --> 41:29.695
But whoever they are,
we're gonna bring them to justice.

41:30.529 --> 41:32.781
And I am not gonna rest
until we get you out of here.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.411
You have my word.
