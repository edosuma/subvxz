00:02.535 --> 00:03.503
<i>Previously on</i>
Young Sheldon...

00:03.570 --> 00:04.637
A secret casino room?

00:04.704 --> 00:06.506
The cops shut me down.

00:06.573 --> 00:07.640
Let's get this going again.

00:07.707 --> 00:09.109
(slot machines whirring)

00:09.175 --> 00:10.143
How we doing?

00:10.210 --> 00:11.578
There's a problem
with the cashbox.

00:11.644 --> 00:12.645
Oh, what's that?

00:12.712 --> 00:14.647
Can't get it to close.

00:14.714 --> 00:17.317
That is my kind of problem.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.554
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Let's talk about</i>
<i>the glory of meetings.</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:24.524
<i>What's not to love?</i>
<i>Agendas, detailed minutes,</i>

00:24.591 --> 00:27.394
<i>and if you're lucky,</i>
<i>they begin and end</i>

00:27.460 --> 00:28.795
<i>with the soothing sound</i>
<i>of discipline and rules.</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:30.663
<i>Ah.</i>

00:30.730 --> 00:32.698
{\an8}<i>You can imagine my frustration</i>

00:32.766 --> 00:35.435
{\an8}<i>when I found out East Texas Tech</i>

00:35.502 --> 00:38.438
{\an8}<i>had faculty meetings that</i>
<i>I was not allowed to attend.</i>

00:38.505 --> 00:39.672
{\an8}Excuse me.

00:38.505 --> 00:39.672
{\an8}<i>Not that I didn't try.</i>

00:39.739 --> 00:41.641
{\an8}Goodbye, Sheldon.

00:39.739 --> 00:41.641
{\an8}SHELDON: Darn it.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.178
{\an8}(quiet chatter)

00:46.212 --> 00:47.447
{\an8}Sheldon, out.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.082
{\an8}Aw.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.351
{\an8}(quiet chatter)

00:55.155 --> 00:57.724
{\an8}Sorry, I thought you were
an irritating young man

00:57.791 --> 00:59.359
{\an8}that won't leave me alone.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.760
{\an8}SHELDON: That's rude.

01:01.694 --> 01:02.629
{\an8}Out.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.263
{\an8}So, how was it?

01:04.330 --> 01:05.565
{\an7}Did any subcommittees
get formed?

01:05.632 --> 01:08.168
{\an8}No, Sheldon,
it was just a budget meeting.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.769
{\an8}Ooh, budgets, do tell.

01:09.836 --> 01:12.439
{\an8}Most of it was about reducing
the gen-ed science requirement

01:12.505 --> 01:14.174
{\an8}from eight credits to four.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.543
{\an7}But that's less science classes.
Who would want that?

01:16.609 --> 01:20.213
{\an8}Apparently the administration,
the students and their parents.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.081
{\an8}Did anyone try to stop it?

01:20.280 --> 01:22.081
{\an9}No.

01:22.148 --> 01:24.451
{\an8}Did it spark a heated debate?

01:22.148 --> 01:24.451
{\an8}Not really, no.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.252
{\an8}Were you at least annoyed?

01:26.319 --> 01:27.854
{\an8}Do I sound annoyed?

01:26.319 --> 01:27.854
{\an7}Yes.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.323
{\an8}Well, there you go.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.323
{\an7}Hmm.

01:30.390 --> 01:33.259
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:33.326 --> 01:36.129
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

01:36.196 --> 01:38.598
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:38.665 --> 01:40.867
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:40.934 --> 01:45.305
♪<i> I am a mighty little man.</i> ♪

01:48.408 --> 01:50.877
{\an7}I can't believe
the faculty is okay with this.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.480
{\an8}It just means students
who aren't science majors

01:53.546 --> 01:55.748
{\an8}need to take one class
instead of two.

01:55.815 --> 01:56.883
{\an8}But that's 50% less.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.418
{\an8}Sheldon, this doesn't
affect you.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.286
{\an8}Less science affects
all of society.

02:00.353 --> 02:01.554
{\an8}And in case you haven't noticed,

02:01.621 --> 02:03.223
{\an8}I'm good at making things
all about me.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.791
{\an8}Yes, I have picked up on that.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.360
{\an8}Sorry, there's nothing
I can do about it.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.895
{\an8}I understand. You're just
a cog in the machine.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.631
{\an8}In fact,
why am I talking to you?

02:11.698 --> 02:13.466
{\an8}Feel free to stop.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.372
{\an8}I thought you'd be at work.

02:19.439 --> 02:21.407
{\an8}I work nights this week.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.543
{\an8}Oh, I didn't realize
the Laundromat was open late.

02:23.610 --> 02:24.777
{\an8}I did that.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.313
{\an8}People work during the day, it
seemed like an untapped market.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.148
{\an8}Smart. You know,

02:29.215 --> 02:30.783
{\an8}if you want to advertise
your new hours,

02:30.850 --> 02:33.253
{\an8}you could take out an ad
in the church bulletin.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.821
{\an8}That ain't a bad idea.

02:34.888 --> 02:37.490
{\an8}Maybe I'm where you get it from.

02:37.557 --> 02:40.660
{\an8}Oh! It could say something like,

02:40.727 --> 02:42.795
{\an8}"Jesus washes away your sins,

02:42.862 --> 02:44.430
{\an8}and we'll wash away
your stains."

02:44.497 --> 02:46.766
{\an8}(chuckles): Wow!
You are really good at this.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.635
{\an7}(laughs)

02:49.636 --> 02:50.837
{\an8}SHELDON: <i> And do you</i>

02:50.904 --> 02:52.205
{\an8}really want to be the president

02:52.272 --> 02:53.706
{\an7}of a university
that is responsible

02:53.773 --> 02:54.908
{\an8}for the dumbing down

02:54.974 --> 02:56.342
{\an9}of scientific discourse
on this campus?

02:56.409 --> 02:58.411
{\an8}I totally agree with you.

02:58.478 --> 02:59.812
{\an8}You do?

02:59.879 --> 03:01.180
{\an8}Oh, it's an outrage.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.649
{\an8}I came here to make this school

03:02.715 --> 03:04.551
{\an8}the Harvard of East Texas.

03:04.617 --> 03:06.319
{\an8}Not the...

03:06.386 --> 03:07.854
{\an8}Wh-What's
your least favorite school?

03:07.921 --> 03:09.355
{\an8}MIT.

03:09.422 --> 03:11.958
{\an8}Not the MIT of East Texas.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.560
{\an8}Nice dig at MIT.

03:13.626 --> 03:14.961
{\an8}(chuckles):
Well, they deserve it.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.363
{\an8}So, you're gonna keep the
science requirements the same?

03:17.430 --> 03:19.432
{\an8}If it were up to me, yes.

03:19.499 --> 03:20.900
{\an8}But you're the president.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.469
{\an8}Everyone has a boss, Sheldon.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.706
{\an8}Now, unfortunately,
I have to answer to the...

03:26.773 --> 03:28.508
{\an8}grand chancellor.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.577
Oh. I've never heard of him.

03:30.643 --> 03:33.246
Oh, well, he definitely exists.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.714
Perhaps I should speak with him.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.951
{\an1}I appreciate that,
but this is my fight--

03:38.017 --> 03:40.253
{\an1}win or lose--
and I'll probably lose,

03:40.320 --> 03:43.523
{\an1}but I am gonna go down swinging,
I promise you that.

03:44.791 --> 03:45.725
Can I help?

03:45.792 --> 03:46.926
Absolutely.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.628
I need you to put together

03:48.695 --> 03:50.530
a report backing up
our position.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.365
Charts, graphs--
the whole shebang.

03:52.432 --> 03:53.700
Hmm.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.268
Charts and graphs of what?

03:55.335 --> 03:56.169
(stammers)

03:56.235 --> 03:58.338
Am I helping you
or are you helping me?

03:58.404 --> 03:59.405
Uh, of course.

03:59.472 --> 04:00.473
I'll figure it out.

04:00.540 --> 04:01.608
I know you will.

04:01.674 --> 04:02.742
{\an1}Okay, now,

04:02.809 --> 04:04.243
get out of here.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.345
You have a lot of work to do.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.679
Yes, ma'am.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.782
{\an5}(sighs)

04:08.414 --> 04:09.782
(door opens)

04:09.849 --> 04:11.517
(door closes)

04:11.584 --> 04:12.919
Kid makes me thirsty.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.824
(coughing)

04:21.861 --> 04:25.565
Maybe we take a little break
and let this one dry out.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.634
You don't have to ask me twice.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.502
{\an3}(coughing)

04:30.503 --> 04:31.804
Do you ever
think about quitting?

04:31.871 --> 04:32.905
This job? Yeah.

04:32.972 --> 04:34.273
Since when did we start

04:34.340 --> 04:36.943
advertising gambling rooms?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.778
What? It's a Laundromat.

04:38.845 --> 04:43.416
Yeah, and the massage parlor off
the freeway is for stiff necks.

04:43.483 --> 04:46.419
(scoffs) Well, that is
a legitimate business.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.788
My mother owns it,
my son works there.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.056
If you say so.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.824
I do say so.

04:51.891 --> 04:52.825
Fine.

04:52.892 --> 04:54.661
It's true.

04:54.727 --> 04:55.962
I'd say, "Want to bet,"

04:56.029 --> 04:57.730
but I lost 40 bucks last night

04:57.797 --> 05:00.500
at your mom's
"legitimate business."

05:01.534 --> 05:03.703
Are you running a gambling room
in the back of the Laundromat?

05:03.770 --> 05:05.805
What? No.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.874
Peg says she was there
last night.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.376
Oh, "gambling room."

05:10.443 --> 05:11.477
Yeah.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.552
What are you thinking?

05:19.619 --> 05:21.554
You know gambling is illegal.

05:21.621 --> 05:24.023
Why do you care
how people spend their money?

05:24.090 --> 05:26.826
Gambling destroys lives.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.628
That's what you say about booze.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.730
I think it's
an excellent pairing.

05:30.797 --> 05:34.367
{\an1}Wait, does Georgie
know about all of this?

05:35.401 --> 05:37.837
{\an5}Um...

05:35.401 --> 05:37.837
Oh, my Lord.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.706
It's okay,
I'm looking after for him.

05:39.772 --> 05:41.474
What if the police show up?

05:41.541 --> 05:43.109
Don't you worry about them.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.610
We got an understanding.

05:44.677 --> 05:45.645
What does that mean?

05:45.712 --> 05:46.746
I'd explain it to you,

05:46.813 --> 05:47.980
but you wouldn't understand.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.982
You are unbelievable.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.385
{\an1}It is bad enough
for you to do all this stuff,

05:52.452 --> 05:55.354
{\an1}but then to drag Georgie down
into your den of sin.

05:55.421 --> 05:58.124
Oh, please,
it's not a den of sin.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.892
Although that is a great name.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.729
Den of Sin.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.630
That would get
some butts in seats.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.065
{\an1}(exclaims)

06:07.834 --> 06:10.136
The chancellor said no?
Did he even look at my report?

06:10.203 --> 06:14.073
He did, he was impressed,
but it didn't change his mind.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.075
After all our hard work.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.144
I know. Bummer.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.046
But hey,
we gave it our best shot,

06:20.113 --> 06:21.881
so time to move on, right?

06:21.948 --> 06:22.882
Absolutely not.

06:22.949 --> 06:26.486
Are you sure?
'Cause it feels like time to me.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.754
We have to keep fighting.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.489
If Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
had given up,

06:29.555 --> 06:30.690
where would we be?

06:31.724 --> 06:32.658
Where would we be?

06:32.725 --> 06:34.160
In a world without microscopes.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.529
Because that guy invented them?

06:36.596 --> 06:38.798
Boy, did he. At least
the first modern microscope.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.500
He's known as
the father of microbiology.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.834
I have a good book on him
I could loan you.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.069
Anyway, we can't give up.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.937
Hey, you are preaching
to the choir,

06:45.004 --> 06:47.406
but... (scoffs)
I mean, what can we do?

06:47.473 --> 06:48.941
I could write to some science
luminaries,

06:49.008 --> 06:50.176
try get them on our side.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.778
Stephen Hawking,
Carl Sagan.

06:51.844 --> 06:53.679
Not Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.
He's dead.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.481
All right,
but just on the off chance

06:55.548 --> 06:58.050
that they're too busy to reply,

06:58.117 --> 07:00.453
I think that you should
get out there on campus,

07:00.520 --> 07:02.555
talk to students,
change their minds.

07:02.622 --> 07:05.057
One-on-one?
That could take months.

07:05.124 --> 07:06.526
Great.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.194
{\an5}ALEX TREBEK:
Animated films.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.929
Frog anatomy.

07:09.996 --> 07:13.065
{\an5}The Bible.

07:09.996 --> 07:13.065
Why are you watching <i> Jeopardy?</i>

07:13.132 --> 07:15.802
Sheldon's not the only one
who likes to learn stuff.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.537
You don't know
where the remote is.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.539
It's right here.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.773
It's just out of batteries.

07:20.840 --> 07:21.841
Want me to get some?

07:21.908 --> 07:24.043
{\an5}And a beer, while you're up.

07:21.908 --> 07:24.043
(door opens, closes)

07:25.945 --> 07:27.079
Is Georgie here?

07:27.146 --> 07:28.347
No, I think he's still at work.

07:28.414 --> 07:32.118
Do you know that that Laundromat
is just a front for gambling?

07:32.185 --> 07:33.119
{\an3}MISSY:
Cool.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.821
Missy Cooper,

07:34.887 --> 07:36.756
that was not for your ears.
Go to your room.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.225
So, what's this all about?

07:40.259 --> 07:42.595
My mother is running
a gambling room

07:42.662 --> 07:44.030
out of the back
of the Laundromat,

07:44.096 --> 07:46.065
and she has Georgie helping her.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.967
They never invited me.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.202
George.

07:49.268 --> 07:50.670
We have to get him out of there.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.705
Mary, we told him
not to drop out of school,

07:52.772 --> 07:54.140
he dropped out of school.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.776
Told him he couldn't
have girls in the garage,

07:56.843 --> 07:58.578
he has girls in the garage.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.146
{\an5}He does?

07:58.644 --> 08:00.146
MISSY: So many.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.247
(scoffs) Missy!

08:01.314 --> 08:02.849
I'm in my room.

08:02.915 --> 08:03.916
Well, close the door.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.853
(door creaks slowly)

08:06.919 --> 08:08.120
All the way.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.255
(door closes)

08:09.322 --> 08:10.256
The point is,

08:10.323 --> 08:11.691
he didn't listen to us then,

08:11.757 --> 08:12.825
he's not gonna listen now.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.160
So, we do nothing?

08:14.227 --> 08:15.828
We let him
make his own mistakes.

08:15.895 --> 08:18.798
That just sounds like another
way of saying we do nothing.

08:18.865 --> 08:20.032
I'm gonna go down there.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.568
And that's a mistake
I'm gonna let you make.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.004
(sighs)

08:25.071 --> 08:27.006
(TV continues indistinctly)

08:27.073 --> 08:29.141
Missy! Batteries!

08:29.208 --> 08:31.744
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>President Hagemeyer</i>
<i>was counting on me</i>

08:31.811 --> 08:34.580
<i>to turn the tide</i>
<i>of public opinion</i>

08:34.647 --> 08:35.847
<i>and ignite the outrage</i>

08:35.914 --> 08:38.618
{\an1}Excuse me, would you like
to sign my petition?

08:38.683 --> 08:39.885
It's about
the university reducing

08:39.952 --> 08:41.020
our science requirements.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.587
(chuckles):
Less science? Sweet.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.890
No, it's to stop the reduction

08:43.956 --> 08:46.559
and keep our
science curriculum strong.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.695
Are you hurrying off
to tell your friends?

08:54.800 --> 08:56.068
"Ben Dover."

08:56.135 --> 08:57.203
Thanks, Ben.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.605
{\an5}No.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.605
Nuh-uh.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.107
Nope.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.645
Excuse me, would you like to
sign my petition about keeping

09:05.711 --> 09:07.647
{\an5}our science requirements strong?

09:05.711 --> 09:07.647
Of course.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.714
If you'll sign mine

09:08.781 --> 09:10.082
to increase funding

09:10.149 --> 09:11.751

ADULT SHELDON:
<i>I needed a new plan.</i>

09:16.022 --> 09:18.157
<i>One where I could</i>
<i>reach the masses.</i>

09:18.224 --> 09:20.059
<i>The front page</i>
<i>of the campus newspaper</i>

09:20.126 --> 09:21.894
<i>was my best course of action.</i>

09:21.961 --> 09:24.797

09:24.864 --> 09:26.065

09:26.132 --> 09:27.066
So funny.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.834
<i>Gravitas.</i>

09:28.901 --> 09:29.835
So moving.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.203
<i>Fearmongering.</i>

09:31.270 --> 09:32.204
So scary.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.106
<i>And last but not least,</i>

09:34.173 --> 09:35.875
<i>heartfelt emotion.</i>

09:35.942 --> 09:38.244
Eh, not where I shine.
I'll end on fear.

09:40.379 --> 09:41.948
(music playing faintly on radio)

09:42.014 --> 09:44.183
(quiet chatter)

09:45.151 --> 09:47.853
Excuse me,
if I had an exposé

09:47.920 --> 09:50.122
that's going to rip the lid off
this university's leadership

09:50.189 --> 09:52.191
and shine a light
on its rotten core,

09:52.258 --> 09:53.225
who would I turn that in to?

09:53.292 --> 09:54.360
You can give it to me.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.561
I'd feel more comfortable
giving it

09:55.628 --> 09:58.230
to someone who's less likely
to roll it up and smoke it.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.866
Well, I'm the editor,
so it's me or nothing.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.168
Very well.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.670
I'm handing you
the scoop of a lifetime.

10:04.737 --> 10:05.972
Okay.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.874
As your people say,
I think you'll dig it.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.245
Georgie.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.047
Hey, what are you doing here?

10:16.048 --> 10:18.351
I know about the room
in the back.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.721
Do you know
whether or not I know?

10:21.787 --> 10:22.722
Yes.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.723
Okay, that's gonna

10:23.789 --> 10:24.724
save us a lot of time.

10:24.790 --> 10:25.992
It is not okay.

10:26.058 --> 10:27.393
You are quitting right now.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.861
Why would I do that?

10:28.928 --> 10:32.264
Because I am your mother,
and it is wrong.

10:32.331 --> 10:35.001
Well, I'm working for your
mother, and she says it's okay.

10:36.035 --> 10:37.636
And I answer to a higher power,

10:37.703 --> 10:39.705
and He says it's also wrong,
so I win, let's go.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.774
Mom, please don't make
a big deal out of this.

10:41.841 --> 10:44.176
Oh, so there is
an illegal gambling room

10:44.243 --> 10:46.012
in the back,
and it's no big deal?

10:46.078 --> 10:47.113
{\an3}There's a gambling room
back there?

10:47.179 --> 10:49.081
{\an3}And there is a church
two blocks down,

10:49.148 --> 10:50.249
so maybe try that.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.752
{\an1}Just go around to the alley.
The password is "dryer sheet."

10:53.786 --> 10:55.855
This is not a joke.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.289
I'm worried about your soul.

10:57.356 --> 10:59.392
I'm not gambling.
No one's getting hurt.

10:59.458 --> 11:03.195
Georgie, I know you think that,
but this does hurt people.

11:03.262 --> 11:05.197
It's not my business
what people do with their money.

11:05.264 --> 11:07.166
And it ain't your business,
either, so butt out.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.304
{\an8}ADULT SHELDON:

11:12.371 --> 11:15.241

<i>Plus, I had Wet-Naps.</i>

11:26.952 --> 11:28.187
Where's my exposé?

11:28.254 --> 11:30.790
{\an5}I didn't run it.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.790
What? Why?

11:30.856 --> 11:32.792
You're blaming this whole thing
on a grand chancellor.

11:32.858 --> 11:33.893
There's no such person.

11:33.959 --> 11:36.796
Of course there is.
He's President Hagemeyer's boss.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.898
She doesn't have a boss.
She's the president.

11:38.964 --> 11:40.366
Yes, she does, and we've been
trying to fight him,

11:40.433 --> 11:42.034
but he won't budge.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.770
The grand chancellor?

11:44.837 --> 11:46.839
Well, when you say it like that
it sounds made-up.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.075
How would you say it?

11:49.141 --> 11:50.409
The grand chancellor.

11:51.944 --> 11:53.179
I've been had.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.220
Mm-hmm. Oh.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.822
Not now, I'm on the phone.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.824
Oh, are you talking
to the grand chancellor?

12:04.890 --> 12:06.992
Who I know doesn't exist,
just like your integrity.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.160
Uh, I'll-I'll call you back.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.295
Don't believe her!

12:09.361 --> 12:11.497
You can't just
barge into my office.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.099
And you can't just
lie to my face.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.300
I can and I did.

12:14.366 --> 12:15.401
Well, I'm going to start

12:15.468 --> 12:17.203
calling you President Hage-liar,

12:17.269 --> 12:18.304
and I think it'll to catch on

12:18.370 --> 12:20.272
because it's
both true and clever.

12:20.339 --> 12:22.508
Look, I know you're upset,
but you left me no choice.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.044
I knew you'd be a pain
in the ass about these cuts.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.345
Language, and also, these cuts

12:26.412 --> 12:28.114
are detrimental
on so many levels.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.348
Not to the university.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.449
Look... (sighs)

12:30.516 --> 12:33.519
My job means sometimes
making very hard decisions.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.087
Now, I'm sorry
that I lied to you,

12:35.154 --> 12:37.857
and-and if it helps,
I didn't enjoy it.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.859
{\an5}Yes, you did.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.859
(chuckles): Yes, I did.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.927
I mean, grand chancellor?
(snorts)

12:41.994 --> 12:43.129
I really pulled that one
out of my...

12:43.195 --> 12:45.397
{\an5}Ah-ah.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.397
...bottom.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.833
Well, I can
lie about things, too.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.503
Did I knock your papers
on the floor?

12:52.538 --> 12:53.939
No, I didn't.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.875
Did I move your stapler?

12:55.941 --> 12:56.876
No, I didn't.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.979
Ooh, did I break your pencil?

13:01.514 --> 13:02.915
(grunts)

13:02.982 --> 13:04.350
Yes, I did.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.553
Hey, Mary.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.888
Quick question.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.923
Why can I see you
through my newsletter?

13:10.990 --> 13:14.160
Oh, sorry,
I had to remove one of the ads.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.828
Was there anything important
on the other side?

13:15.895 --> 13:18.898
Just Peg's recipe
for her grape salad.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.233
With the mayonnaise
and the pretzels. Barf.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.103
Everything okay?

13:27.439 --> 13:29.909
I feel like I'm a failure
as a mother.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.277
What?

13:32.278 --> 13:34.079
{\an3}Why?

13:36.282 --> 13:38.551
Georgie dropped out of school,

13:38.617 --> 13:41.020
and now he's working
in a gambling room.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.857
I tried so hard
to keep him on the right path,

13:44.924 --> 13:47.493
and now I feel like
I'm just pushing him away.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.828
Hey, teenagers rebel.

13:49.895 --> 13:51.263
When I was a kid

13:51.330 --> 13:53.399
in El Paso,
we used to cross the border

13:53.465 --> 13:55.234
to drink beer
and dance the night away.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.469
I thought
your father was a pastor.

13:57.536 --> 13:59.972
He was.
It didn't stop me.

14:00.039 --> 14:02.107
It's hard to imagine.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.842
I'm sure my father
felt the same way

14:03.909 --> 14:05.878
when he found his little jefe
doing the hustle

14:05.945 --> 14:07.079
<i>en la discoteca.</i>

14:07.146 --> 14:08.514
(both chuckle)

14:08.581 --> 14:12.218
Just picture this,
but with a big ol' '70s perm.

14:12.284 --> 14:13.519
I looked like a Chia Pet.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.887
♪ Do the hustle. ♪

14:16.655 --> 14:17.423
(music playing faintly on radio)

14:17.489 --> 14:19.491
{\an1}I still can't believe
she lied to me.

14:19.558 --> 14:23.229
{\an3}Look, here's something
you should know about life:

14:23.295 --> 14:24.530
People lie.

14:24.597 --> 14:25.864
{\an1}Everybody?

14:25.931 --> 14:26.966
Pretty much.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.367
Well, I don't like it.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.903
{\an3}Mm. It's not always
a bad thing.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.972
When is lying good?

14:33.038 --> 14:36.642
Like when you're trying
to spare someone's feelings.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.245
Oh, I'd rather everybody
just be honest.

14:39.311 --> 14:40.479
Hmm.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.614
Fine.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.316
The last thing I wanted to do
today was pick you up.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.118
You said you were
happy to do it.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.519
See? Lies.

14:47.586 --> 14:49.555
Not the worst.

14:50.589 --> 14:53.259
I think I need to stop
blindly trusting everything.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.561
{\an3}Hmm. Probably not
a bad idea.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.662
{\an1}Thanks.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.464
I wish I could believe you.

...absolutely necessary.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.307
You're not a captain.
You're just an actor.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.042
Which is another word for liar.

15:10.109 --> 15:12.311
And nothing...

15:12.378 --> 15:14.580

A bowl of lies.

It's great.

15:42.174 --> 15:43.442
I bet it's all fake.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.244
Does that look fake to you?

16:13.539 --> 16:15.574
True. I'll make it quick.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.677
I'm experiencing what
the Germans call weltschmerz.

16:18.744 --> 16:19.745
Uh-huh.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.281
And what do Americans call it?

16:22.348 --> 16:23.515
The pain of the world.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.484
Sounds more fun in German.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.086
Most things do.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.555
Hmm. Sit.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.092
{\an1}Tell me why you have...
What is it?

16:33.158 --> 16:34.259
Weltschmerz.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.728
Weltschmerz.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.365
{\an3}It's recently come
to my attention

16:39.431 --> 16:41.200
{\an3}that everybody lies
and you can't believe

16:41.266 --> 16:43.102
{\an3}a thing that comes out
of anyone's mouth.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.705
{\an1}I don't think everybody lies.
You don't lie.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.774
No, but perhaps to
get by in the world

16:48.841 --> 16:50.576
{\an3}it's a skill
I should cultivate.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.177
I hope you don't.

16:52.244 --> 16:53.579
I love your honesty.

16:53.645 --> 16:56.148
I want to believe you.

16:56.215 --> 16:57.649
(scoffs) You should,

16:57.716 --> 17:00.185
{\an1}because I'm your mother
and I would never lie to you.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.720
{\an3}I would never lie
to you, either.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.156
So, I guess not everybody lies.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.394
{\an3}I heard what you said
in your prayer,

17:08.460 --> 17:10.429
{\an3}and I don't think you're
failing as a mother.

17:10.496 --> 17:12.364
{\an1}Thank you.

17:12.431 --> 17:15.200
{\an1}I think you're
a pretty great son yourself.

17:15.267 --> 17:17.202
I know I'm difficult.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.673
{\an1}There is not a single thing
about you I would change.

17:21.740 --> 17:25.411
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>My mom promised</i>
<i>she would never lie to me.</i>

17:25.477 --> 17:26.744
<i>And she never did.</i>

17:26.811 --> 17:28.180
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.755
(slot machines whirring)

17:38.424 --> 17:39.358
Hey.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.093
Mom send you?

17:41.160 --> 17:42.428
No.

17:42.494 --> 17:43.629
She also doesn't know I'm here,

17:43.695 --> 17:44.830
so let's keep that between us.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.432
All right.

17:46.498 --> 17:48.233
Where's your meemaw?

17:48.300 --> 17:49.601
Not here.
She leaves me in charge

17:49.668 --> 17:51.470
{\an5}when she's gone.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.470
Is that right?

17:51.537 --> 17:53.639
I also handle stuff
in the Laundromat.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.107
Well, good for you.

17:55.174 --> 17:58.510
So... you're okay
with me working here?

18:00.145 --> 18:01.380
Well, since I never been here

18:01.447 --> 18:03.115
and we never had
this conversation...

18:03.916 --> 18:05.117
...sure.

18:05.184 --> 18:07.119
Cool.
Want to give it a spin?

18:08.687 --> 18:10.422
These things really pay out?

18:10.489 --> 18:11.757
All the time.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.860
Not that one.
We call it the homewrecker.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.628
Which one, then?

18:16.695 --> 18:18.230
That one's your buddy.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.399
Yeah?

18:22.267 --> 18:24.670
Look at me!
I-I won two dollars!

18:28.307 --> 18:30.209
<i>(phone rings)</i>

18:30.275 --> 18:31.577
President Hagemeyer.

18:31.643 --> 18:32.778
{\an5}(speaking device):
Miss Hagemeyer,

18:32.845 --> 18:34.546
Stephen Hawking here.

18:35.481 --> 18:38.350
Oh, hello. I...

18:38.417 --> 18:40.819
I... Is this really
Stephen Hawking?

18:40.886 --> 18:43.422
Does it not sound like me?

18:43.489 --> 18:46.325
Sorry, I have a cold.

18:46.391 --> 18:47.659
Oh, uh...

18:47.726 --> 18:50.229
That was a joke. Ha, ha, ha.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.431
(chuckles) Uh...

18:52.498 --> 18:54.199
how can I help you, sir?

18:54.266 --> 18:56.735
{\an5}I received a letter
from one of your students

18:56.802 --> 19:00.672
{\an5}about the decision
to reduce science requirements.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.242
Very disappointing.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.477
Well, I would never
want to disappoint you,

19:05.544 --> 19:07.779
but that-that wasn't
my decision.

19:07.846 --> 19:10.449
Whose decision was it?

19:11.550 --> 19:13.685
The grand chancellor.

19:13.752 --> 19:16.221
{\an5}That is a lie.

19:13.752 --> 19:16.221
Yeah, yeah, that's a lie.

19:16.288 --> 19:19.758
{\an5}Has anyone ever called you
President Hage-liar?
