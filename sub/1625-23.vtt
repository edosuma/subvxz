WEBVTT

00:01.843 --> 00:03.411
Whoever tipped me
in Monopoly money

00:03.412 --> 00:05.547
can go directly to jail.

00:06.548 --> 00:07.949
A dollar?

00:07.950 --> 00:10.985
Fake money
and they're still under-tipping.

00:16.724 --> 00:18.159
Oh, look.
I love it when people

00:18.160 --> 00:21.930
dress Guinea pigs up
in adorable costumes.

00:21.931 --> 00:23.831
Han, you look like Babe Ruth.

00:24.082 --> 00:27.451
Well, baby Ruth.

00:27.452 --> 00:29.787
Maybe you two
can kiss my sweet ass,

00:29.788 --> 00:33.224
because this outfit's
a home run.

00:33.225 --> 00:35.860
I'm putting a team together
for the restaurant league.

00:35.861 --> 00:38.496
Well, Han, I would play,
but you know,

00:38.497 --> 00:39.797
I've got this hip thing,

00:39.798 --> 00:42.366
meaning, I'm too hip.

00:42.767 --> 00:43.901
What about you two?

00:43.902 --> 00:46.103
I'm telling you,
I'm a great ball player.

00:46.204 --> 00:48.306
No,
I'm a great ball player.

00:48.307 --> 00:52.276
I know how to cup and tickle
mine at the same time.

00:52.777 --> 00:56.213
I'm talking about America's
favorite pastime.

00:56.214 --> 00:58.716
Oh, so am I.

01:01.553 --> 01:03.821
Well, I'm in.
I have a really good arm.

01:03.822 --> 01:06.824
Go over there, Han.
Let's have a little catch.

01:06.825 --> 01:09.727
All right, here we go.
All right.

01:09.728 --> 01:12.763
Go deep.
Go deeper, Han.

01:12.764 --> 01:18.235
A phrase no other woman
will ever say to him.

01:18.236 --> 01:21.439
Throw it, and don't be afraid
to bring the heat.

01:23.976 --> 01:27.178
Ooh!

01:27.179 --> 01:29.413
Too much heat.

01:29.414 --> 01:33.150
Ball one... and two.
Game over.

01:33.451 --> 01:37.722
I seem to have forgotten
a crucial part of my uniform.

01:38.123 --> 01:40.458
Need a cup, Han?

01:41.760 --> 01:43.995
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

01:45.564 --> 01:49.967

01:58.041 --> 01:59.475
You ladies
can wait in here.

01:59.476 --> 02:02.812
Brian, before my father
comes in, how are his spirits?

02:02.813 --> 02:03.813
You know,
for someone who's looking

02:03.814 --> 02:06.249
at 60 to 100 years
in prison?

02:06.250 --> 02:08.084
Pretty good.

02:08.085 --> 02:09.619
I'll bring him right in.

02:09.620 --> 02:11.921
Hey, Bri,
anyone get killed today?

02:11.922 --> 02:14.657
You ask me that every time,
Max, and every time I tell you,

02:14.658 --> 02:16.492
it's a white collar prison.

02:16.493 --> 02:20.530
Got it. Anyone get shanked
with a Mont Blanc pen?

02:21.031 --> 02:22.765
Yo, B, one more thing.

02:22.766 --> 02:24.734
On <i>Lock Up: Raw,</i>
they always spray the guards

02:24.735 --> 02:26.435
with a mixture of urine
and feces, so--

02:26.436 --> 02:29.472
Max, please, can we go one day
without you mentioning that?

02:29.973 --> 02:31.607
I wonder why my dad
wanted us

02:31.608 --> 02:33.309
to rush out here
and see him today.

02:33.310 --> 02:35.044
He probably wants
a conjugal visit.

02:35.045 --> 02:36.846
- Max!
- Relax!

02:36.847 --> 02:38.249
With me.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.885
There they are,
the light of my life

02:42.886 --> 02:44.587
- and her bouncer.
- Hi, Daddy.

02:44.588 --> 02:47.423
Hey.
Max.

02:47.424 --> 02:49.892
Oh, we startin' this?
No foreplay?

02:49.893 --> 02:53.462
Oh.

02:53.463 --> 02:56.599
Listen, I'm sorry to make you
come all the way out here

02:56.600 --> 03:02.205
on the--God help me--subway,
but I actually need a favor.

03:03.173 --> 03:06.709
Help me break out.

03:06.710 --> 03:08.110
I'm kidding.

03:08.111 --> 03:10.279
Daddy, it's so amazing
you can joke,

03:10.280 --> 03:11.814
but maybe not around Max.

03:11.815 --> 03:13.716
She's already offered
to skin a guard alive

03:13.717 --> 03:15.785
and walk you out of here
wearing him.

03:15.786 --> 03:18.788
Well, we know it works.

03:18.789 --> 03:19.855
All right, listen.

03:19.856 --> 03:21.090
This woman
who used to work for me

03:21.091 --> 03:22.925
is being paid
a million dollars

03:22.926 --> 03:25.428
to write a tell-all book
about me.

03:25.429 --> 03:27.430
A million dollars?

03:27.431 --> 03:29.865
How much can I get for
a tell-all book about Caroline?

03:29.866 --> 03:32.902
Chapter one:
"Sleep farts."

03:32.903 --> 03:36.472
Max, please, can we go one day
without you mentioning that?

03:37.173 --> 03:39.375
The woman's name
is Sandra Rosenthal.

03:39.376 --> 03:40.676
Caroline,
do you remember her?

03:40.677 --> 03:42.678
Yes, the one
who lied on her resume.

03:42.679 --> 03:44.981
The one who couldn't even add,
and worse than that,

03:44.982 --> 03:48.150
she wore brown
with black together.

03:48.151 --> 03:50.119
I like brown and black
together.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.655
I know.

03:52.656 --> 03:55.691
Wait, why would anybody
pay that woman so much?

03:55.692 --> 03:57.360
What is she saying
she has on you?

03:57.361 --> 03:58.794
Well, she's claiming
she was fired

03:58.795 --> 04:00.329
because she had
insider information

04:00.330 --> 04:02.031
about the Ponzi scandal,

04:02.032 --> 04:04.667
and that we were sleeping
together, which we weren't.

04:04.668 --> 04:06.335
Of course you weren't.
You would never

04:06.336 --> 04:09.038
sleep with someone who wore
brown with black together.

04:09.039 --> 04:11.040
Man, I haven't seen
this much hatred

04:11.041 --> 04:14.110
toward brown and black
since the '50s.

04:14.111 --> 04:16.312
Anyway, I wanted you
to hear it from me first,

04:16.313 --> 04:18.346
because she's about to go
on <i>Piers Morgan Live,</i>

04:18.348 --> 04:20.483
and she can say
whatever she wants.

04:20.483 --> 04:23.386
No, she can't, because I'll
be there to refute her lies.

04:23.387 --> 04:25.187
I'll defend you
with dignity and class

04:25.188 --> 04:28.791
and my new lipstick
I just found on the subway.

04:28.792 --> 04:31.661
Wow, Piers Morgan.
That dude's legit.

04:31.662 --> 04:35.665
He's got a show,
he's got Piers 1 Imports.

04:35.666 --> 04:38.668
I don't know what I'd do
without you, princess.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.404
You're the only person
I can trust.

04:41.405 --> 04:43.005
Now, get out of here,
'cause I gotta speak to Max

04:43.006 --> 04:44.640
privately for a second.

04:44.641 --> 04:46.709
Oh... sure.

04:46.710 --> 04:47.977
- Okay, I--
- Just go.

04:47.978 --> 04:50.047
Daddy wants to talk
to me privately.

04:51.448 --> 04:53.149
- Love you, sweetie.
- Love you, Daddy.

04:53.150 --> 04:55.418
Brian, I'll just be
right outside.

04:58.855 --> 05:00.556
So, Max...

05:00.557 --> 05:03.125
You know I'm all talk,
right?

05:03.126 --> 05:05.294
I need you
to tell Caroline something

05:05.295 --> 05:08.464
I couldn't bring myself
to say.

05:08.465 --> 05:10.399
This woman is also claiming

05:10.400 --> 05:14.403
I have a small penis.

05:14.404 --> 05:16.238
Wait.

05:16.239 --> 05:19.210
So I stayed behind
to see it?

05:22.211 --> 05:24.613
No.

05:24.614 --> 05:28.317
I want you to tell Caroline
so she'll be prepared,

05:28.318 --> 05:29.785
'cause I'm pretty sure
that's the lie

05:29.786 --> 05:31.253
that got the book sold.

05:31.254 --> 05:33.322
How big of a lie?

05:33.323 --> 05:38.427
Oh, a really big one.

05:41.698 --> 05:44.166
So what did you and my father
talk about?

05:44.167 --> 05:46.268
I don't want to tell you.
I'm uncomfortable.

05:46.769 --> 05:48.671
<i>You're</i> uncomfortable?

05:48.672 --> 05:50.239
This must be bad.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.007
You've never been uncomfortable
in your life.

05:52.008 --> 05:54.243
Is it drugs? Cancer?

05:54.244 --> 05:56.345
Oh! Did he fall in love
in prison?

05:56.346 --> 05:57.913
I'll be fine with it.
You can tell me.

05:57.914 --> 05:59.615
When we had money,
I was very active

05:59.616 --> 06:03.719
in the Park Avenue Straights
for Gay Doormen Alliance.

06:09.492 --> 06:10.626
Is this
some kind of weird gang,

06:10.627 --> 06:12.628
or did a game
just let out?

06:12.629 --> 06:14.563
Max, come on.
Tell me.

06:14.564 --> 06:17.533
Fine, the woman's gonna say
your father has a small--

06:19.136 --> 06:23.839
Sir, your vuvuzela
is very loud, and very 2010.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.374
My father has a what?

06:25.375 --> 06:26.776
He has a small--

06:28.545 --> 06:30.546
Seriously,
the game's over.

06:30.547 --> 06:33.549
And how on earth you have
a wedding ring is beyond me.

06:33.550 --> 06:34.984
What is she gonna say
about him?

06:37.087 --> 06:40.122
I can't hear you!
She's going to say...

06:40.123 --> 06:44.326
Your father has
a small penis!

06:44.327 --> 06:47.062
He thought it'd be less awkward
if I told you.

06:47.063 --> 06:48.297
Was it?

06:48.298 --> 06:50.833
I can't believe
that Sandra Rosenthal woman.

06:50.834 --> 06:53.102
There's another lie.
Why, have you seen it?

06:53.103 --> 06:55.638
No, I haven't seen it!
I never want to see it.

06:55.639 --> 06:57.440
Have you seen
your father's penis?

06:57.441 --> 07:00.176
If I did,
it was waving good-bye.

07:08.270 --> 07:09.671
Max, I've thought a lot
about it,

07:09.672 --> 07:11.339
and I can't sit there
while that woman

07:11.340 --> 07:14.442
waves my father's penis
in Piers Morgan's face.

07:14.443 --> 07:16.544
You're lucky
it's not Anderson Cooper,

07:16.545 --> 07:19.213
'cause he'd be
giggling up a storm.

07:19.914 --> 07:20.782
I have a plan.

07:21.033 --> 07:23.701
My goal on this show is gonna be
to discredit that woman

07:23.702 --> 07:26.170
and tell people, even though
my father did a bad thing,

07:26.171 --> 07:27.939
he did some wonderful things
as well.

07:27.940 --> 07:30.675
Look, here he is
working with UNICEF.

07:30.676 --> 07:33.311
Here he is
rebuilding Haiti.

07:33.312 --> 07:35.813
Oh, this is just a cute picture
of him water-skiing

07:35.814 --> 07:37.581
at a charity event
on Lake Tahoe.

07:37.582 --> 07:41.252
What's the charity?
White men without golf clubs?

07:41.253 --> 07:43.220
So that's my plan,
and hopefully,

07:43.221 --> 07:44.689
going on that show
will put an end

07:44.690 --> 07:47.291
to all these ridiculous rumors
about my father.

07:48.292 --> 07:50.129
Hey, Caroline.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.465
Yeah.

07:54.466 --> 07:58.169
The word on the street
is your dad's got a weenis.

07:58.870 --> 08:00.771
Sophie, how did you hear
about that?

08:00.772 --> 08:02.340
Oleg told me.

08:02.341 --> 08:05.309
It came up
on my Google penis alerts.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.945
I like to keep current,
see what the trends are.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.714
You don't want to be
that middle-aged guy

08:09.715 --> 08:12.817
wearing the same penis
you had in high school.

08:13.518 --> 08:15.519
Great, now,
it's all over the Internet

08:15.520 --> 08:17.755
and my shoulders
are all up around my ears.

08:17.756 --> 08:20.458
Look, I'm too tense
to even shake my head "no"

08:20.459 --> 08:23.461
at that liar woman,
which was gonna be my key move.

08:23.462 --> 08:26.831
I need a massage,
but I'm broke.

08:26.832 --> 08:29.166
Caroline,
I'll give you a massage.

08:29.167 --> 08:32.570
Get ready for a sad ending.

08:32.571 --> 08:36.474
And beginning, and middle.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.042
There.

08:38.043 --> 08:40.378
Oh, yeah.

08:40.379 --> 08:42.113
How does that feel?

08:42.114 --> 08:46.550
Like baby spiders
are dancing on my shoulders.

08:47.051 --> 08:48.819
You're the first Asian
I've seen

08:48.820 --> 08:51.522
that can't give a massage.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.228
Hey, Caroline,
I'll treat you and Max

08:57.229 --> 08:59.363
to a massage
at my fancy spa.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.632
Cool!
I've never been to a spa.

09:01.633 --> 09:03.367
The closest I've been
is sticking my arm

09:03.368 --> 09:07.004
in the free blood pressure
machine at Walgreens.

09:07.405 --> 09:11.242
Wait, that's for your arm?

09:15.113 --> 09:17.114
Thanks for the massage, Han.
It was very nice--

09:17.115 --> 09:19.850
Oh, you're still doing it.
I had no idea.

09:25.322 --> 09:28.492
That was a-mazing!

09:28.743 --> 09:31.078
I mean, a guy rubbed me
for an hour

09:31.079 --> 09:34.248
and didn't expect
anything back?

09:34.249 --> 09:37.351
This massage stuff
could catch on.

09:37.352 --> 09:40.921
I could not let go
during my massage.

09:40.922 --> 09:43.857
Oh, was letting go
an option?

09:43.858 --> 09:46.193
I was close, but I didn't want
to get halfway there

09:46.194 --> 09:48.862
and have the management
throw me out or something.

09:48.863 --> 09:50.264
I'm just so tense.

09:50.265 --> 09:52.166
Piers Morgan asks
some difficult questions.

09:52.167 --> 09:54.702
Last week, he asked
the <i>Spring Breakers</i> cast

09:54.703 --> 09:57.938
their thoughts
on the North Korea situation.

09:57.939 --> 09:59.206
Shh!

09:59.207 --> 10:00.674
Sorry.

10:00.675 --> 10:03.477
Max, this is a quiet room.
We have to be quiet.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.946
Hi, girls!

10:05.947 --> 10:09.283
Oh, I'm getting myself
some fancy water.

10:09.284 --> 10:13.020
Look, they got lemon,
orange, and cucumber.

10:13.021 --> 10:16.990
Ha! It's like a slot machine
over here.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.526
Shh!

10:23.932 --> 10:27.735
Oh, I just had
the best bamboo massage.

10:27.736 --> 10:29.770
Oh, they kept whacking me
with it

10:29.771 --> 10:34.742
until I confessed to stealing
that bread when I was seven.

10:34.743 --> 10:37.511
Oh, what a load off.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.981
Caroline, you still look
a little tense,

10:40.982 --> 10:43.617
but I guess having to talk
about your father's junk

10:43.618 --> 10:48.021
on national television
will do that to a girl.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.624
I will not be speaking
about my father's "junk"

10:50.625 --> 10:52.025
on television.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.928
No, I can't have lunch
tomorrow.

10:54.929 --> 10:58.232
I'm doing
<i>Piers Morgan Live.</i>

10:59.667 --> 11:02.536
You won't believe
what just happened.

11:02.537 --> 11:05.439
You joined
a demonic cult?

11:05.440 --> 11:07.775
Sandra, the liar writing
the tell-all book,

11:07.776 --> 11:09.643
just walked in.

11:09.644 --> 11:12.179
She's getting
a day of beauty too?

11:12.180 --> 11:15.716
This is like the gayest training
for a fight ever.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.918
Sandra?

11:17.919 --> 11:19.420
Right this way.

11:19.421 --> 11:21.088
Lay face down.

11:21.089 --> 11:23.424
I'll give you a few minutes
and I'll be right back in.

11:23.425 --> 11:25.359
Perfect.
I really need this massage.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.361
Promoting my new book
is exhausting.

11:27.362 --> 11:28.929
I'm sorry
if that sounded braggy,

11:28.930 --> 11:30.297
but I guess
that's how you sound

11:30.298 --> 11:32.599
when things are going
so great for you.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.536
Ugh! That poor masseuse
is gonna be forced

11:35.537 --> 11:38.038
to listen to her yammer on
about her dumb book.

11:38.039 --> 11:40.574
But then again, mine
had to hear me constantly say,

11:40.575 --> 11:43.078
"don't be afraid
of the boobs."

11:44.879 --> 11:47.214
We should be hearing
about that dumb book

11:47.215 --> 11:48.749
so I know
what I'm up against.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.351
If there was only a way
to get in that room.

11:51.352 --> 11:56.957
Oh, anyone can get into
any room if they really want to.

11:56.958 --> 11:59.126
I mean, do you think
that I was invited

11:59.127 --> 12:02.396
to the audition
for the 2004 boat show?

12:02.397 --> 12:04.631
Yeah.
Go.

12:04.632 --> 12:06.900
I'll take care
of that masseuse.

12:06.901 --> 12:09.069
Sophie, you're not gonna
hurt her, right?

12:09.070 --> 12:12.906
No. I'm gonna try
tipping her first.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:21.182 --> 12:23.617
I'm back.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.986
Yes, I was just
out in the hall with you,

12:25.987 --> 12:28.589
now, here I am
in the room with you,

12:28.590 --> 12:31.091
the same person.

12:31.092 --> 12:36.430
Just keep your head down,
don't look up, and relax.

12:36.431 --> 12:38.332
You're not gonna talk a lot,
are you?

12:38.333 --> 12:41.235
No, but you should
feel free to.

12:41.236 --> 12:44.071
Whatever's on your mind
or in in that book.

12:44.072 --> 12:45.506
What?

12:45.507 --> 12:47.107
What was that?

12:47.108 --> 12:48.442
That?

12:48.443 --> 12:50.544
That's just me, alone,

12:50.545 --> 12:53.413
creating a healing space
with energy and sound.

12:54.782 --> 12:57.551
Lots of sound.

12:57.552 --> 13:00.454
So you're writing
a big book.

13:00.455 --> 13:03.123
Do you want to tell me
all about that?

13:03.124 --> 13:05.225
Well, it's about this guy,
Martin Channing.

13:05.226 --> 13:10.631
Oh, he is very nice
and very respectable.

13:10.632 --> 13:12.599
You won't think that
after you read my book.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.035
I am really gonna
stick it to him.

13:15.036 --> 13:16.770
Okay, now,
you're just pushing me.

13:16.771 --> 13:18.972
Ugh!

13:19.974 --> 13:22.676
Uh, how did you--

13:25.747 --> 13:30.284
uh... How--
how did you do that?

13:30.285 --> 13:33.554
It feels like
you have three hands.

13:37.058 --> 13:40.460
That's how good I am.

13:40.461 --> 13:42.930
This is supposed to be
a hot stone massage.

13:42.931 --> 13:44.865
Comin' right up.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.902
The hot stones.

13:51.606 --> 13:54.541
Oh!

13:57.144 --> 14:00.948
All right, here come
the ho-o-ot stones.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.351
Oh!

14:04.352 --> 14:07.487
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's nice.

14:07.488 --> 14:09.056
I'm really loosening up.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.024
Oh, well, then let's
loosen you up some more.

14:11.025 --> 14:12.259
More stones.

14:13.528 --> 14:15.996
More stones!

14:19.233 --> 14:22.603
Yeah, I'm got paid a lot
of money for my tell-all book,

14:22.604 --> 14:24.871
and I am really gonna
tell all.

14:24.872 --> 14:29.443
Oh! Not there!
Not there.

14:29.444 --> 14:31.778
What?
What is going on in here?

14:31.779 --> 14:34.181
Well, what is
happening here, Sandra,

14:34.182 --> 14:36.049
is you're about to go
on national TV

14:36.050 --> 14:37.884
and tell America lies
about my father.

14:37.885 --> 14:39.252
He never slept with you.

14:39.253 --> 14:42.389
Oh. Did he never sleep with me
in your bedroom,

14:42.390 --> 14:44.992
on your pink canopy bed?

14:44.993 --> 14:47.427
You know what?
That never happened.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.363
That's insane.
You're crazy.

14:49.364 --> 14:50.964
Well, it's my word
against yours.

14:50.965 --> 14:53.367
You're gonna be
very embarrassed on TV.

14:53.368 --> 14:55.836
But not as embarrassed as you're
going to be in the spa lobby,

14:55.837 --> 14:58.805
when I tell everyone that
I was touched inappropriately

14:58.806 --> 15:00.641
by Caroline Channing.

15:00.642 --> 15:02.943
You are not gonna
tell anybody that.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.544
Who's gonna stop me?

15:04.545 --> 15:06.179
Hey, girls.

15:06.180 --> 15:08.448
I was listening
outside the door.

15:08.449 --> 15:12.252
Everything okay?

15:21.318 --> 15:23.286
Max, I don't know
if I can do this.

15:23.737 --> 15:25.271
What if Sandra's
telling the truth?

15:25.272 --> 15:27.106
She did know
about my pink canopy bed.

15:27.107 --> 15:28.674
How would she know that?

15:28.675 --> 15:31.344
Because everyone knows
Barbie comes with a dream car,

15:31.345 --> 15:34.547
a pony, and a pink canopy bed
included.

15:35.048 --> 15:37.917
There he is.
There's Piers Morgan, live.

15:39.353 --> 15:40.753
Do you think
it's too soon to ask him

15:40.754 --> 15:43.556
to give me a discount
at Piers 1?

15:43.557 --> 15:47.393
He looks dignified, like he's
not gonna ask about a penis.

15:47.394 --> 15:50.229
But what if he does?
Max, I can't do this.

15:50.230 --> 15:51.998
Give me your phone.

15:51.999 --> 15:53.532
You need
to remind yourself

15:53.533 --> 15:55.501
of the person your father
used to be.

15:55.502 --> 15:57.770
Look, here he is
working with UNICEF.

15:57.771 --> 16:01.374
And here he is water-skiing
on "Lake Rich Person."

16:01.375 --> 16:05.111
Look at that smile.
Is that the smile of--hold up.

16:05.112 --> 16:07.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:07.881 --> 16:12.351
What's coming out of
the left leg of his swim shorts?

16:12.352 --> 16:14.387
I think your father's junk
is trying to tell me

16:14.388 --> 16:17.423
there's gonna be
six more weeks of winter.

16:17.924 --> 16:19.592
What are you saying?

16:19.593 --> 16:22.561
I'm saying,
someone had a tip slip,

16:22.562 --> 16:26.198
and that is not
a small tip.

16:26.199 --> 16:28.401
And as a waitress
and a loose woman,

16:28.402 --> 16:31.904
I know a small tip
when I see one.

16:32.205 --> 16:35.007
- Here.
- Oh!

16:36.076 --> 16:37.977
Sorry, sorry.

16:37.978 --> 16:41.814
She just showed me a picture
of Anne Hathaway's new haircut.

16:44.518 --> 16:47.720
Well, this is good, because
it proves that woman is lying.

16:47.721 --> 16:49.955
Yep, you just have to
show this to Piers.

16:49.956 --> 16:54.360
I told you, I'm not
going near my father's penis.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.028
All I have to do
is point out

16:56.029 --> 16:58.030
that that woman
has no finance skills.

16:58.031 --> 17:00.199
Unlike her,
we are taking the high road.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.568
Max, are you sending that
to yourself?

17:06.740 --> 17:08.307
I'm here
with Sandra Rosenthal,

17:08.308 --> 17:09.909
who's just signed
a huge book deal

17:09.910 --> 17:11.109
to do a kiss-and-tell

17:11.111 --> 17:13.345
on disgraced financier
Martin Channing.

17:13.346 --> 17:14.446
Welcome to you, Sandra.

17:14.448 --> 17:15.548
Hello, Piers.

17:15.549 --> 17:17.817
Thank you for allowing me
to tell my story.

17:17.818 --> 17:19.652
It's a story, all right.

17:19.653 --> 17:22.088
Wow, so we're right into it.
Okay, well, let me catch up.

17:22.089 --> 17:23.923
My other guest
is Caroline Channing,

17:23.924 --> 17:26.525
daughter of Martin Channing,
who, to put it mildly,

17:26.526 --> 17:28.794
is claiming that your book,
Ms. Rosenthal,

17:28.795 --> 17:30.663
is a bunch of bull.

17:30.664 --> 17:31.964
That's right, Piers.

17:31.965 --> 17:33.099
It's pure rubbish,

17:33.100 --> 17:34.934
As your people say.

17:34.935 --> 17:39.271
That was perfectly American.

17:39.272 --> 17:40.840
Right, then,
let me start with you.

17:40.841 --> 17:42.341
Well, to catch everybody up,
Ms. Rosenthal's

17:42.342 --> 17:44.276
large book advance really
has to do with something

17:44.277 --> 17:47.713
that turned out to be,
by your words, very small.

17:47.714 --> 17:48.981
Comments, Ms. Channing?

17:48.982 --> 17:52.618
Psst! Psst!

17:52.619 --> 17:54.854
I'd rather not comment
about that, Piers,

17:54.855 --> 17:56.889
because I have class,
but I do have a question

17:56.890 --> 17:59.391
for Ms. Rosenthal,
who was hired by my father

17:59.392 --> 18:01.560
because she claimed
she had a degree in finance.

18:01.561 --> 18:04.897
Ms. Rosenthal, if a train
carrying 27 passengers

18:04.898 --> 18:07.299
leaves Grand Central Station
at 9:00 a.m.,

18:07.300 --> 18:11.003
travels 800 miles to Chicago,
arriving at 5:00 p.m.,

18:11.004 --> 18:13.172
how fast was it traveling?

18:13.173 --> 18:14.473
Well, I--

18:14.474 --> 18:16.108
Simple math, Piers.

18:16.109 --> 18:18.911
- 100 miles an hour.
- I'm sorry?

18:18.912 --> 18:22.047
That's your answer.
Sorry, I'm a bit of a mathlete.

18:22.048 --> 18:23.482
Impressive.

18:23.483 --> 18:25.618
I've got a math equation
for you.

18:25.619 --> 18:28.554
If a 3-inch train
is entering a tunnel,

18:28.555 --> 18:31.557
do I even know it's there?

18:31.558 --> 18:33.559
Ladies, this isn't
<i>Maury Povich.</i>

18:33.560 --> 18:35.694
Psst! Psst!

18:35.695 --> 18:37.563
Piers, I am simply
trying to illustrate

18:37.564 --> 18:39.131
that she should have
been able to answer it,

18:39.132 --> 18:41.636
had she been qualified
for her job in finance.

18:43.637 --> 18:46.272
Everything that I am writing
in the book is true, Piers.

18:46.273 --> 18:48.040
There is nothing
that I have said

18:48.041 --> 18:50.309
that she can prove
is untrue.

18:53.814 --> 18:58.017
Wait a minute, why is there
a woman under my desk?

18:58.018 --> 19:00.152
Oh, is there, Piers?

19:00.153 --> 19:02.788
Yes, my father
defrauded a lot of people,

19:02.789 --> 19:04.490
and he's paying a price
for that,

19:04.491 --> 19:06.592
but I'm not gonna sit by
silently while she exploits him

19:06.593 --> 19:08.327
with lies for her own gain.

19:08.328 --> 19:10.229
Piers, there's so much
about my father

19:10.230 --> 19:12.498
I want you to know,
like he--

19:17.437 --> 19:19.505
What is this?

19:19.506 --> 19:21.974
Well... I know what this is.

19:21.975 --> 19:23.742
I've got one.

19:23.743 --> 19:26.178
But whose is it,
and why am I looking at it?

19:26.179 --> 19:28.514
It's my father's.

19:28.515 --> 19:32.084
He had a bit of a tip slip.

19:32.085 --> 19:34.587
Madam, I don't know what
you're looking for in a man,

19:34.588 --> 19:37.156
but this...

19:37.157 --> 19:39.260
Is far from inadequate.

19:41.261 --> 19:43.829
In fact, it's so far
from inadequate,

19:43.830 --> 19:45.965
that I'm bringing this interview
to an immediate close.

19:45.966 --> 19:49.201
Your book and you lack
any credibility.

19:49.902 --> 19:51.471
That's it.

19:55.108 --> 19:59.378
"Can you hook me up with
a discount at Piers 1 Imports?"

20:03.783 --> 20:05.184
Hey, you know,
they'll probably come to you

20:05.185 --> 20:06.852
one day and want
a tell-all book.

20:06.853 --> 20:10.456
Remember, we already have
chapter one, "sleep farts."

20:10.457 --> 20:14.193
Chapter two:
"My new Stepmom Max."

20:16.462 --> 20:19.131
Max, am I gonna have to defend
my father forever?

20:19.132 --> 20:21.967
Probably, but don't worry,
I'll be there to help.

20:21.968 --> 20:23.302
Thank you.

20:23.303 --> 20:24.136
'Cause it's a wife's job

20:24.137 --> 20:26.639
to defend her husband.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.642
It makes me sad to think
he's gonna be in prison

20:29.643 --> 20:31.543
for the rest of his life.

20:31.544 --> 20:34.113
Don't think of it like that.
He's not just in prison.

20:34.114 --> 20:36.582
He's in Africa
working with UNICEF,

20:36.583 --> 20:40.085
he's in Haiti, he's water-skiing
on "Lake Rich Person,"

20:40.086 --> 20:42.924
and he's on the desktop
of my computer.

20:44.925 --> 20:46.959
I should delete that.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.931
Where'd I leave my phone?

20:51.932 --> 20:54.333
Oh, God, are you guys looking
at the picture of my dad?

20:54.334 --> 20:56.403
We are. Respect.

20:58.004 --> 21:00.006
So very much respect.

21:01.207 --> 21:03.110
Eh, I've seen better.

21:04.711 --> 21:06.280
Every day.

21:09.582 --> 21:10.816
Give me that.

21:10.817 --> 21:12.052
Oh!
