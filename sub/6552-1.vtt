00:37.170 --> 00:39.772
      It's coming for us,
            Captain!

00:39.774 --> 00:42.708
          It has eyes
     as big as basketballs.

00:42.710 --> 00:47.446
     It can see everywhere,
 even in the pitch black water.

00:47.448 --> 00:50.349
         It has a beak
     like Mom's parakeets,

00:50.351 --> 00:52.584
  but a thousand times bigger,

00:52.586 --> 00:54.820
        that can cut you
         right in half,

00:54.822 --> 00:58.290
    and eight legs that can
  rip a blue whale's head off,

00:58.292 --> 01:00.759
   and tentacles that feed it
          to its beak.

01:00.761 --> 01:03.062
   If it gets me, I'm toast.

01:03.064 --> 01:07.199
        If it gets you,
    you're a bacon sandwich.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.234
Watch out, Captain!

01:09.236 --> 01:11.637
  The leviathan has the ship!

01:14.541 --> 01:16.508
  We're going under, Wee Wee!

03:44.891 --> 03:47.392
        Hey, Johnathan?

03:47.394 --> 03:48.961
          - Johnathan.
            - What?

03:48.963 --> 03:51.697
    Man, I told you to check
  the traps, not go swimming.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.999
       - We went fishing.
  - You can't fish underwater.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.001
        - And who is we?
       - Me and Wee Wee.

03:56.003 --> 04:00.239
 Don't molest that pig, and go
 get ready for school, please.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.007
    Naw. Take your medicine.

04:03.676 --> 04:06.445
       Mm-mm! All of it.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.613
            Come on.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.751
          Chew it up.
      I wanna see it gone.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.717
             Linda!

04:53.526 --> 04:55.661
- Hello.
<i>-  You have a collect call from--</i>

04:55.663 --> 04:57.296
     <i> Caller, say your name.</i>

04:57.298 --> 05:00.299
            <i> - David.</i>
        <i> - Do you accept?</i>

05:00.301 --> 05:01.900
              Yes.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.738
           Hey, Dad.
          Is Jo there?

05:06.740 --> 05:08.073
         <i> No, she's not.</i>

05:08.075 --> 05:10.409
       Would you like me
     to give her a message?

05:10.411 --> 05:15.080
        No, never mind.
     I wrote her a letter.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.581
  <i> When are you gonna come home</i>

05:16.583 --> 05:18.684
         and take care
     of your business, son?

05:18.686 --> 05:21.320
       Okay, well, uh...
          I gotta go.

05:21.322 --> 05:24.056
   <i> - I'll try it later then.</i>
    - Listen to me, if you--

05:42.875 --> 05:45.610
      <i> So what do you want</i>
   <i> to study in school today?</i>

05:45.612 --> 05:47.646
         <i> Sea monsters.</i>

05:47.648 --> 05:49.648
          <i> Sea monsters</i>
       <i> are not a subject.</i>

05:49.650 --> 05:52.084
     <i> Let's do math instead.</i>

05:52.086 --> 05:54.653
             <i> Okay.</i>

05:54.655 --> 05:56.755
      <i> I'm nine years old,</i>
         <i> and you're 27.</i>

05:56.757 --> 05:58.423
           <i> Yes, sir.</i>

05:58.425 --> 06:00.959
    <i> That means you were 18</i>
        <i> when you had me.</i>

06:00.961 --> 06:04.496
     <i> Yeah, well, let's not</i>
     <i> do math today either.</i>

06:04.498 --> 06:06.665
  <i> Why don't we study science?</i>

06:06.667 --> 06:08.500
      <i> We can do dinosaurs.</i>

06:08.502 --> 06:11.536
     <i> How about prehistoric</i>
         <i> sea creatures?</i>

06:11.538 --> 06:14.506
          <i> Okay, fine.</i>
    <i> So long as they're real.</i>

06:14.508 --> 06:16.074
       Which one's this?

06:16.076 --> 06:19.644
      Predator X, which is
 a pliosaur with 12-inch teeth.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.880
    So was that the baddest
     creature in the ocean?

06:21.882 --> 06:25.784
   Some people say this one's
   the baddest, a megalodon.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.553
    But pliosaurs are cooler
          than sharks,

06:28.555 --> 06:31.857
       and the megalodon
     only had 8-inch teeth.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.458
       Do you think there
     was really an asteroid

06:33.460 --> 06:34.926
        that killed them
      like that book says?

06:34.928 --> 06:36.628
          I guess so.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.163
        Well, you know,
      I think that's dumb.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.132
   I don't think an asteroid
     can destroy everything

06:40.134 --> 06:41.833
  that's on the whole planet.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.669
       I don't even think
  a nuclear bomb can do that.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.805
  We dropped a couple of those
   on Japan in World War II,

06:46.807 --> 06:48.473
   and it didn't do nothing.

06:48.475 --> 06:52.411
I still got a radio from the 90s
    that was made in Japan.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.945
   But they say that asteroid

06:53.947 --> 06:57.449
  was a million times stronger
       than an atom bomb.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.719
         - Hey, hombre!
      - What's up, Curtis?

07:00.721 --> 07:01.853
       What's up, buddy?

07:01.855 --> 07:03.855
         - Hey, Curtis.
           - Hi, Jo.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.957
  - We got a question for you.
            - Okay.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.059
       What do you think
     killed the dinosaurs?

07:09.962 --> 07:12.864
 Well, there was a polar shift,

07:12.866 --> 07:15.200
      and Earth's magnets
         got reversed.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.769
 It went from being 80 degrees

07:17.771 --> 07:21.039
      to like 500 degrees
         in the shade,

07:21.041 --> 07:22.874
      and they all melted
        and became tar.

07:22.876 --> 07:26.178
  That's where oil comes from.
         Fossil fuels.

07:26.180 --> 07:30.982
     Now we fight wars over
  dead dinosaurs... and drugs.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.718
  - Probably right about that.
        - I totally am.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.020
         Let me guess.
     You want a yellow one?

07:35.022 --> 07:37.522
Yes, and some birdseed, please.

07:37.524 --> 07:40.492
  You know, you don't have to
   buy the parakeet, Curtis.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.160
      I know, but you know
         what they say.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.795
 When in Rome, do as Romans do.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.798
    Shit in the pope's hat.
      Something like that.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.469
     Well, here's your, uh,
           medicine.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.604
       - Thank you, Doc.
           - Mm-hmm.

07:52.606 --> 07:56.141
   The FDA would not approve.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.611
         But screw 'em.
     This is a pilgrimage.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.780
     - What's a pilgrimage?
          - Precisely.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.548
  This day in modern medicine

08:03.550 --> 08:05.517
    has made the pilgrimage
        an anachronism.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.652
     Kind of like a spider
   or something? A tarantula?

08:07.654 --> 08:13.058
  No, yeah, an old one that's
out of fashion, lost its touch.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.626
  How many birds you got now?

08:14.628 --> 08:15.794
         Just this one.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.231
       And just a little
     something extra for...

08:19.233 --> 08:21.733
       I don't take money
      for the medication.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.603
  - Extra for the beautiful--
       - I don't do that.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.838
     It's for the beautiful
         parakeet, Jo.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.907
     It's my favorite one.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.709
          Bye, Curtis.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.010
           Bye, girl.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.181
              Bye!

08:36.183 --> 08:38.783
            Woo-hoo!

08:53.599 --> 08:54.799
            Woo-hoo!

09:01.073 --> 09:02.941
      - Got you something.
          - Thank you.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.576
   Thank the jellybean stalk.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.978
           Thank you,
        jellybean stalk!

09:08.615 --> 09:10.148
              Ohh!

09:10.150 --> 09:12.284
             Whee!

09:22.261 --> 09:23.862
          - Hey, Mark.
             - Hey.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.631
        - Hey, Grandpa.
         - Hey, buddy.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.732
         - You hungry?
            - Yeah.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.035
   Grandma's cooking dinner.

09:30.037 --> 09:34.706
      She got some of that
  chicken casserole you love.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.208
    Hey, Johnathan, will you
     take that stuff inside

09:37.210 --> 09:39.210
   and then go help Grandma?

09:39.212 --> 09:41.179
- Grandpa and I are gonna talk.
            - Okay.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.948
   We'll see you in a minute,
             buddy.

09:44.617 --> 09:45.817
           What's up?

09:45.819 --> 09:48.687
      Well, David called.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.722
        - What'd he say?
          - Not much.

09:50.724 --> 09:55.961
   I told him you'd had your
   electricity disconnected.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.862
              And?

09:57.864 --> 10:02.634
   Well, he asked me if it'd
   be okay if you moved home.

10:04.937 --> 10:08.340
          - I am home.
     - No. I mean with us.

10:12.111 --> 10:18.083
 Well, it's a good thing Linda
  wants that as much as I do.

10:18.085 --> 10:22.721
   Sweetheart, I don't think
       he's coming back.

10:27.393 --> 10:32.030
 Linda says she's fine to have
     Johnathan stay with us

10:32.032 --> 10:34.866
        till things get
    a little better for you.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.704
  She doesn't think I can take
    care of my own son, huh?

10:39.706 --> 10:41.640
       I didn't say that.

10:49.081 --> 10:53.084
   Are you gonna have dinner
        with us or what?

10:53.086 --> 10:54.819
            JoLynn!

10:56.222 --> 11:00.425
        - Hey, Grandma.
 - Hey. Let me see your hands.

11:00.427 --> 11:04.129
    Oh, Lord, go wash those
      mud mitts right now.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.331
     No, no, no, not there.
      I'm preparing food.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.999
      Go to the bathroom.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.069
   And don't touch anything!

11:11.071 --> 11:13.738
        Fingernails too.

11:15.975 --> 11:18.043
     Is your mom giving you
       your eye medicine?

11:18.045 --> 11:20.311
       Yeah, twice a day.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.716
          Straighten.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.451
           Oh, go on.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.455
         Hey, Grandpa,
   will you tell me the story

11:30.457 --> 11:35.126
     about the sea monster
          in the lake?

11:35.128 --> 11:40.098
 Okay. We were dropping anchor,
    and this green ensign--

11:40.100 --> 11:41.866
     Now, when I say green,

11:41.868 --> 11:44.769
      I mean greener than
      a bullfrog's nipple,

11:44.771 --> 11:47.806
    greener than them beans
       right there, okay?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.974
  Has no idea what he's doing.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.343
    He's letting that chain
    run out into the ocean,

11:52.345 --> 11:56.748
 and that chain has links on it
       that are this big.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.750
     So before we know it,

11:58.752 --> 12:01.953
       that guy is ripped
      clean off the deck,

12:01.955 --> 12:05.924
and the only thing sitting there
        is a severed leg

12:05.926 --> 12:10.095
      and a trail of blood
  leading straight overboard.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.163
            - Whoa.
    - Have we heard enough?

12:12.165 --> 12:14.032
          No, Grandma,
     this is the best part.

12:14.034 --> 12:17.202
 Now, you eat those vegetables,
       and I'll continue.

12:17.204 --> 12:21.372
    So now I have to dive in
  to try to retrieve the body.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.508
   I mean, for proper burial,
             right?

12:23.510 --> 12:25.477
 How did you know he was dead?

12:25.479 --> 12:31.449
  'Cause I had to swim through
  a cloud of blood and sharks.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.518
    Did the sharks eat him?

12:33.520 --> 12:36.221
     Probably. I don't know
 'cause I never found the body.

12:36.223 --> 12:41.426
     It was too dangerous,
  so I just froze and watched.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.463
      And all of a sudden,
 up from below came something.

12:45.465 --> 12:49.434
      I swear I don't know
          what it was,

12:49.436 --> 12:53.371
      but it had these big
    tentacles that came down

12:53.373 --> 12:57.509
 and wrapped themselves around
  this full-grown tiger shark

12:57.511 --> 12:59.978
          like it was
    a little bitty football.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.546
     Was it a giant squid?

13:01.548 --> 13:04.783
   Maybe, but it jetted back
       into the deep blue

13:04.785 --> 13:06.951
       before I could get
       a good look at it.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.821
    I will promise you this,
            though.

13:09.823 --> 13:13.091
        There is nothing
      in the entire ocean

13:13.093 --> 13:19.130
 that would ever stand a chance
 against a creature like that.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.432
    All right, are we done?

13:21.434 --> 13:23.501
    'Cause I have completely
       lost my appetite.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.070
       Can I be excused?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.806
      <i> Can</i> you be excused?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.908
       <i> May</i> I be excused?

13:29.910 --> 13:31.543
             Fine.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.079
              Hey.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.581
        What do you say?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.216
      Thank you, Grandma.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.952
        You're welcome.
          I love you.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.587
         Love you too.
         Bye, Grandpa.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.255
         Bye, Captain.

13:47.393 --> 13:51.196
         Can you please
         pass the salt?

13:53.299 --> 13:55.133
         Pretty please?

13:55.135 --> 13:57.235
    With shark guts on top.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.925
- Hey, baby, what's the matter?
        - My head hurts.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.494
     Let me see your eyes.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.030
  Here, lie down. I'll get you
      some medicine, okay?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.237
       Here, baby, here.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.039
    Come lie on Mama's lap.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.941
         Come lie down.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.312
          Chew it up.
 The pressure's gonna go down.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.081
   It hurts real bad tonight.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.183
            I know.
   Just hang in there, okay?

14:46.452 --> 14:48.519
       Just keep chewing.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.045
           Johnathan!

15:50.215 --> 15:51.683
           Johnathan!

15:53.185 --> 15:54.319
Ah!

15:54.321 --> 15:55.553
            No! No!

15:55.555 --> 15:57.255
           Johnathan,
      no, no, no, no, no!

15:57.257 --> 16:00.024
              No!

16:00.026 --> 16:03.328
Come on! Grandpa's gonna be here
      in a couple minutes.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.963
       Go get cleaned up.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.101
   I got a favor to ask you.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.736
           Ask away.

16:13.272 --> 16:18.109
    It's kinda hired for me,
         but I'm, uh...

16:18.111 --> 16:20.111
      I'm a little behind
          on my rent.

16:20.113 --> 16:23.448
            Oh, boy.
        How far behind?

16:25.084 --> 16:27.318
      About three months.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.487
         Three months?

16:29.489 --> 16:33.157
       Good Lord, JoLynn.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.594
 You know I'd love to help you,
but I gotta be honest with you.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.030
    The way they've cut back
         my retirement,

16:39.032 --> 16:42.433
          we just flat
     don't have it, honey.

16:46.372 --> 16:49.507
 When David called, did he say
     he wasn't coming back?

16:51.777 --> 16:55.546
    He didn't say anything.

16:55.548 --> 16:59.550
          I don't know
      what he's gonna do.

16:59.552 --> 17:03.187
       That's the truth.

17:03.189 --> 17:08.226
  Honey, I will do everything
     I can to help you out.

17:08.228 --> 17:11.628
       Okay? No promises.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.464
            Thanks.

17:17.301 --> 17:20.038
         - You all set?
           - Mm-hmm.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.111
   His headaches have gotten
          a lot worse.

17:27.113 --> 17:30.214
 He's been sick to his stomach
             a lot.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.816
       Johnathan, please.

17:31.818 --> 17:36.187
I know the trab was our big hope
   after the laser surgeries,

17:36.189 --> 17:40.558
but often it takes more than one
procedure to lower the pressure.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.529
   With glaucoma, many times
   surgeries just don't work.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.298
 Now, you and your husband need
     to prepare yourselves

17:47.300 --> 17:50.435
  for the fact that Johnathan
   may just need to take meds

17:50.437 --> 17:53.404
   for the rest of his life.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.340
  So the drops are working to
  control the pressure spikes?

17:56.342 --> 17:58.576
   Yeah, they make his vision
         blurry though.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.245
  He complained about-- Well,
  he complains about it a lot.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.347
  Well, he needs them though.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.716
     You need to make sure
         he takes them.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.352
 After that allergic reaction,
   he's afraid of the drops.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.588
       I'm gonna keep him
        on the myotics.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.290
      The spikes are just
         too dangerous.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.259
    I'm going to have to add
       an oral inhibitor,

18:15.261 --> 18:17.295
   and we'll see how he does.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.764
     Contact me immediately

18:19.766 --> 18:22.400
       if he experiences
    any shortness of breath.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.669
      Now, my adding these
        may make him...

18:24.671 --> 18:28.339
    a little tired and weak,
    just a little sluggish.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.342
But that could be good for you.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.544
     Boys can be a handful.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.516
     You ready, Johnathan?
           Let's go.

18:48.894 --> 18:51.863
Can I go check the fishing lines
     at Mr. Upshaw's pond?

18:51.865 --> 18:54.198
       Yeah, that's fine.
  Just don't get caught, okay?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.801
         - No swimming.
         - Yes, ma'am.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.607
  I got to go give her a hand
         in the garden.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.443
     This is how I maintain
      my girlish physique.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.744
           Hey, Mark?

19:06.746 --> 19:08.813
             Yeah.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.249
    Thank you for taking us
      to the doctor today.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.251
           Of course.

20:12.911 --> 20:16.347
    You know as well as I do
 that those are not hog tracks.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.616
 You know where they came from.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.918
   Did you talk to Johnathan?

20:20.920 --> 20:22.987
      Yeah. He denies it.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.856
     Seemed a little dodgy
         to me though.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.292
       If she would just
    keep an eye on that boy,

20:28.294 --> 20:30.861
     teach him some respect
         for property.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.764
          Don't start.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.734
   What are these doing out?

21:03.363 --> 21:05.363
       It's okay, fishy.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.733
     I'm here to save you,
    so Mommy don't eat you.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.671
          Hah! Gotcha!

21:13.673 --> 21:16.974
         I don't think
     you taste good anyway.

21:19.746 --> 21:22.947
 Johnathan, you went swimming.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.582
       Come on, let's go.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.651
     - Where are we going?
      - We're going home.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.653
        But we're going
    to Grandma's for dinner.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.855
  Look, I don't want you going
   to Grandma's again, okay?

21:30.857 --> 21:32.623
       - Not without me.
             - Why?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.692
       Because I said so.

21:36.828 --> 21:39.797
   Look, she's pissed because
you keep breaking all her stuff.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.733
       I didn't mean to.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.735
        I know, I know.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.605
     It's just shit anyway.

21:47.607 --> 21:50.541
        The whole house
        is full of shit.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.877
 We're not going there anymore.

21:54.513 --> 21:59.684
Look, I'm gonna take care of you
       from now on, okay?

21:59.686 --> 22:02.053
     Till Daddy comes back.

22:02.055 --> 22:03.821
             Okay.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.825
            Come on.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.094
    From now on, nobody can
    come in the house, okay?

22:10.096 --> 22:12.663
            Nobody.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.800
           Especially
      Grandma and Grandpa.

22:17.102 --> 22:20.104
         - You hear me?
         - Yes, ma'am.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.348
Go!

22:30.350 --> 22:34.719
            1, 2...

22:34.721 --> 22:38.356
            3, 4...

22:38.358 --> 22:41.025
         I can't do it
   if you don't hold my feet.

22:41.027 --> 22:45.596
         - Hey, JoLynn!
    - Oh, God. It's Natalie.

22:45.598 --> 22:49.567
     Hey! Sorry to drop in
          unannounced.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.469
  What happened to your phone?

22:51.471 --> 22:54.638
  - Oh, it just got shut off.
 - Oh, well, ain't that shitty.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.774
        Hey, Johnathan,
      looking like a stud.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.843
       Hey, Aunt Natalie.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.978
Hey, I wanna tell you something.

23:02.514 --> 23:05.416
  Hey, 20 more minutes of P.E.
        while we visit.

23:23.869 --> 23:26.137
         Wee Wee, help!

23:26.139 --> 23:28.572
Come on,
   you never get out anymore.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.041
 I know, but I can't just leave
   Johnathan here by himself.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.843
  He can take care of himself.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.912
     I mean, really, what's
   the worst that can happen?

23:34.914 --> 23:39.049
    A pig get in your house?
 It wouldn't be the first time.

23:41.487 --> 23:43.020
           All right.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.961
  Hey, if me and Aunt Natalie
       went out tonight,

23:50.963 --> 23:53.431
      - would you be good?
         - Yes, ma'am.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.965
  And I don't want you to let
     Wee Wee in the house,

23:54.967 --> 23:56.500
      and I don't want you
    going down to Grandpa's.

23:56.502 --> 23:57.835
             Okay.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.036
           All right,
   I'll pick you up at 8:00.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.639
        - Bye, sweetie.
             - Bye.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.840
     Where are y'all going?

24:02.842 --> 24:04.909
        Get rent money.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.619
             <i> G-49.</i>

24:15.621 --> 24:17.655
Hey, are you sure
         he's got this?

24:17.657 --> 24:21.859
Relax. We can't lose.
  He's like a computer genius.

24:21.861 --> 24:25.062
   Hi. We need six computers
        split two ways.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.566
          That's $90.
      It'll be 45 apiece.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.134
      Natalie, that's all
      the money I've got.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.036
      Okay. Stop bitching.

24:32.038 --> 24:35.206
  Pretty soon we are gonna be
      splitting jackpots.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.074
<i> First number out</i>
<i>will determine the wild number,</i>

24:37.076 --> 24:38.776
   <i> and it's gonna be a nine.</i>

24:38.778 --> 24:41.645
        Oh, there he is.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.582
        <i> Mark everything</i>
    <i> ending in 9 through 69.</i>

24:44.584 --> 24:46.083
         - Hey, cowboy.
         - Hey, ladies.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.985
       - This is JoLynn.
        - Looking good!

24:47.987 --> 24:50.488
  - Nice to meet you, JoLynn.
 - Hey, it's nice to meet you.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.156
     What have we got here?

24:52.158 --> 24:56.093
   Good. Bingo Bill gave you
    lucky number six for me.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.696
       That's my hot box.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.097
       Are y'all feeling
      the fortune tonight?

25:00.099 --> 25:03.200
          - Oh, yeah.
           - Me too.

25:03.202 --> 25:07.771
       Now, let me go do
whatever it is I do, all right?

25:11.209 --> 25:14.278
           I told you
      he was cute as hell.

25:19.284 --> 25:22.119
          Here you go.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.588
   Don't tell Mama, Wee Wee.

26:03.296 --> 26:07.831
       Bad pig! Bad pig!
   You're a naughty pig! Bad!

26:57.249 --> 26:59.717
            <i> - G-49.</i>
       <i> -</i> Damn it. I'm on.

26:59.719 --> 27:03.387
          Come on, 63!
           Or an 18.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.389
              <i> B5.</i>

27:06.992 --> 27:08.092
              <i> B1.</i>

27:08.094 --> 27:09.360
             Bingo!

27:16.101 --> 27:17.701
             Sorry.

27:19.804 --> 27:23.073
        - It's a winner.
    <i> - We have a good bingo.</i>

27:23.075 --> 27:25.009
        - What the hell?
 - Look, I'm sorry, all right?

27:25.011 --> 27:26.276
   No! You said we had this!

27:26.278 --> 27:28.045
           You'd pull
     your dumb-ass strings.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.713
    You really think I could
     rig a damn bingo game?

27:29.715 --> 27:30.814
   Are you that damn stupid?

27:30.816 --> 27:33.150
         What is this,
        some shit line?

27:33.152 --> 27:36.286
       Look, I got lucky.
       Sorry you didn't.

27:36.288 --> 27:39.323
     - You son of a bitch.
          - Natalie...

27:39.325 --> 27:42.926
        Get out of here,
        you trashy ass.

27:42.928 --> 27:44.228
          - Hey, hey!
       - Don't touch me.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.996
   Oh, one whore sticking up
          for another?

27:45.998 --> 27:48.399
      - That's my sister.
 - Oh, must run in the family.

27:48.401 --> 27:50.300
      You don't know shit
        about my family.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.369
   Oh, I don't? What's that?
  Bet your husband has no idea

27:52.371 --> 27:54.938
 you're out here whoring it up
at a bingo parlor for a dollar.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.306
            Please.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.375
 Yeah, give me a call sometime.
        We can do that.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.977
 - Your sister's got my number.
           - Get out.

27:59.979 --> 28:01.145
      I got it, I got it.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.814
    Sorry about that, y'all.
             Bitch.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.917
       Sorry. It's cool.

28:10.088 --> 28:13.023
  Oh, look at these tomatoes.
     Oh, they look so ripe.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.059
       Yeah! Tomato guts!

28:17.996 --> 28:19.463
          Tomato man!

28:31.710 --> 28:33.911
        So how's David?

28:33.913 --> 28:37.247
         I don't know.
          You tell me.

28:37.249 --> 28:40.184
    I haven't heard from him
        in over a month.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.953
       I haven't either.

28:42.955 --> 28:46.123
 Mark offered for us to move in
      with him and Linda.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.759
        - Why don't you?
      - What do you think?

28:48.761 --> 28:51.428
    - Till David comes back.
         - Oh, please.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.430
 Hey, at least the man's trying
 to do something with his life.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.099
        It's about time.

28:55.101 --> 28:58.001
     - Yeah, must be nice.
     - At least you got one

28:58.003 --> 29:00.871
that's trying to make something
    out of himself for you.

29:00.873 --> 29:03.173
         Must be nice.

29:04.843 --> 29:07.778
    David asked you to call
  and check on me, didn't he?

29:09.347 --> 29:11.949
  He leaves me for two months
   with nothing but a letter,

29:11.951 --> 29:12.983
       but he calls you?

29:12.985 --> 29:14.885
    You don't got no phone.

29:14.887 --> 29:17.421
   Well, I'm not the one that
  racked up a $500 phone bill,

29:17.423 --> 29:18.989
         booking a tour
 all over kingdom come either.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.357
    I'm just trying to help.
           Chill out.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.026
    Help? You just helped me
     lose everything I had.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.462
   You think I wanted to drag
your lame ass out of the house?

29:25.464 --> 29:27.097
       Then why did you?

29:27.099 --> 29:29.867
      You never come over
   unless you want something.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.870
    Maybe I just don't want
  to see you end up like Mom.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.305
   You really think I'm gonna
     drink myself to death

29:35.307 --> 29:37.174
    - because a man left me?
 - I don't know what you'd do.

29:37.176 --> 29:40.410
       You've always been
  the depressed, serious type.

29:40.412 --> 29:44.081
 Maybe if you relaxed for once,
 you could find someone better.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.482
         - More coffee?
      - Yeah, fill 'er up.

29:45.484 --> 29:48.118
      She likes it black.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.420
     Get a new wig, bitch.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.790
          Kiss my ass!

29:56.294 --> 29:59.029
       Ow. Stupid thing.
            Come on!

30:17.148 --> 30:18.348
              Hey!

30:21.186 --> 30:23.987
          Go, Wee Wee!

30:23.989 --> 30:26.190
          Go, go, go!
          Go, go, go!

30:26.192 --> 30:27.891
            Woo-hoo!

30:34.132 --> 30:35.332
         I'm so sorry.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.602
    I will talk to Johnathan
        in the morning.

30:38.604 --> 30:41.972
            No. No.

30:41.974 --> 30:44.308
      No, this time you're
      gonna do something.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.410
   What do you want me to do?

30:46.412 --> 30:49.847
 You let her run all over you,
      and now her boy too.

30:49.849 --> 30:54.618
  Why don't you do something?
    They're your family too.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.620
       All right, I will.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.389
            - Good.
  - I will take care of this.

31:19.344 --> 31:22.913
         What the hell?
           Johnathan!

31:22.915 --> 31:25.449
     Wee Wee, what are you
         doing in here?

31:25.451 --> 31:26.950
          Oh, my God.

31:32.991 --> 31:34.958
           Johnathan!

31:44.569 --> 31:46.570
           Johnathan!

31:48.072 --> 31:50.440
   What the hell, Johnathan?

31:50.442 --> 31:52.910
 What did you do to my plants?

31:52.912 --> 31:55.445
   I wanted to make brownies.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.148
       Are you an idiot?
     Why would you do that?

31:58.150 --> 32:01.318
    - That's your medicine!
        - I don't know.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.987
  It's a gonna take me months
       to grow 'em back!

32:14.599 --> 32:16.266
             Fuck!

32:43.227 --> 32:45.295
         Can I come in?

32:59.477 --> 33:02.245
   I'm sorry I yelled at you.

33:05.149 --> 33:08.685
        I'm sorry, Mama.
   I don't know why I did it.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.758
           You did it
      'cause you're a kid.

33:16.761 --> 33:22.299
    I keep asking you to be
      a man for me, but...

33:22.301 --> 33:25.335
   you just need to be a kid.

33:30.641 --> 33:33.210
          I miss Dad.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.212
            Me too.

33:43.721 --> 33:46.123
     You'll never leave me,
           will you?

33:49.627 --> 33:52.129
    I will never leave you.

33:52.131 --> 33:56.066
          I love you.

33:56.068 --> 34:00.237
         I will always,
        always love you.

34:00.239 --> 34:03.106
        No matter what.

34:03.108 --> 34:06.610
           No matter
     what you become and...

34:06.612 --> 34:10.246
    no matter if you grow up
       and do bad things.

34:12.717 --> 34:16.286
        I will love you
      more than God does.

34:56.427 --> 34:59.863
  - Sheriff Cole, you're back.
      - I'm sorry, JoLynn.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.565
       How come with all
     the deputies you got,

35:01.567 --> 35:02.866
  you come see me personally?

35:02.868 --> 35:04.801
    Could you step outside,
            please?

35:04.803 --> 35:06.736
      I'm fine right here,
           thank you.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.475
      Well, I need to know
       where your pig is.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.310
      How come you asking?

35:13.312 --> 35:15.512
      Well, your neighbor
      down the hill here,

35:15.514 --> 35:17.247
      they pressed charges
         this morning.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.149
          My neighbor?
  That's my husband's parents.

35:19.151 --> 35:23.620
 I understand that, JoLynn, but
 I have to issue you a citation

35:23.622 --> 35:27.457
 for trespassing and vandalism
  perpetrated by your pet pig.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.726
I know.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.261
            Come on.

35:38.336 --> 35:42.439
  I'm also gonna need to know
  the whereabouts of your pig,

35:42.441 --> 35:44.207
           currently.

35:44.209 --> 35:45.675
  Well, you're looking at her.

35:45.677 --> 35:49.646
       Where-- God dang!
   That's not funny, JoLynn!

35:49.648 --> 35:52.215
  I'm gonna tell you something
 right now, and I mean it too.

35:52.217 --> 35:54.784
     You contain your pig,
           all right?

35:54.786 --> 35:57.320
If I catch him off the premises
         one more time,

35:57.322 --> 35:59.823
    I'm gonna confiscate and
 the euthanize the damn thing.

35:59.825 --> 36:03.927
        That's bullshit!
      Ham and egg bastard.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.663
      Pig shit everywhere.
       Get away from me!

36:14.473 --> 36:17.240
        Ham hock-lookin'
        son of a bitch.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.313
              Yah!

36:32.224 --> 36:33.356
Hey.

36:35.593 --> 36:39.663
   Well, Linda, they gave me
   a $250 ticket. You happy?

36:39.665 --> 36:41.298
     I didn't want for you
        to get a ticket.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.766
     Well, then why did you
      call the cops on me?

36:42.768 --> 36:44.768
 I wanted to make a statement.

36:44.770 --> 36:48.238
      Well, I'm here now.
   Make your damn statement.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.974
       Say what you want
         to say to me.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.210
            - Okay.
           - Say it!

36:53.212 --> 36:55.312
    You need to get your kid
         under control.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.514
      And maybe you should
    teach him not to steal,

36:57.516 --> 36:59.783
 while you're homeschooling him
    sub-kindergarten skills.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.685
 Kind of like you did your son?

37:01.687 --> 37:04.654
    The one that walked out
         on his family?

37:04.656 --> 37:07.357
    At least I teach my son
  to be a human fucking being!

37:07.359 --> 37:09.259
That's enough. Outside.

37:09.261 --> 37:10.827
      You gonna run me out
     like a little dog now?

37:10.829 --> 37:14.464
       Get outside. Now.
            Come on.

37:17.301 --> 37:19.336
           - Damn it!
  - Will you please calm down?

37:19.338 --> 37:21.571
   She doesn't like the fact
that I'm a high school dropout,

37:21.573 --> 37:23.006
 and I'm homeschooling my son,

37:23.008 --> 37:24.574
      but yet he can't see
      the damn chalkboard.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.543
 I need to tell you something.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.778
No! You know, she's refusing to
 accept that he's going blind,

37:28.780 --> 37:30.347
       even though she's
     constantly complaining

37:30.349 --> 37:31.615
       that he's breaking
        her little shit.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.784
   Shush! Let me talk, okay?

37:34.786 --> 37:37.754
  Wee Wee just didn't get into
     her garden last night.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.023
    Johnathan led her there.

37:40.025 --> 37:43.560
      Tore the whole thing
           to pieces.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.262
         - You saw him?
            - Yeah.

37:45.264 --> 37:48.331
 I fired a shot up into the air
        to run him off.

37:48.333 --> 37:52.936
    You have got to get this
 situation under control, okay?

37:52.938 --> 37:55.972
      If you can't afford
   to pay rent or utilities,

37:55.974 --> 37:59.909
   you damn sure can't afford
 to feed a 300-pound nuisance.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.646
    David gave him that pig.
         He loves her.

38:02.648 --> 38:06.383
        A full-grown pig
         is not a pet.

38:06.385 --> 38:09.052
         You wanna tell
      your grandson that?

38:09.054 --> 38:12.856
       No. I'm not trying
    to tell you what to do.

38:12.858 --> 38:16.626
      I'm just saying that
    with your circumstance,

38:16.628 --> 38:20.330
    you have got to explore
         some options.

38:23.334 --> 38:24.534
           Come here.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.770
     I gotta go. I'm sorry.

38:43.654 --> 38:47.324
         - Who's there?
       - Uh, it's JoLynn.

38:51.962 --> 38:54.664
       - Hey, buddy. Hi.
         - Hey, Curtis.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.666
        I was just, uh,
      I was just riffing.

38:56.668 --> 38:59.769
      I got cooler songs.
   I was just riffing around.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.971
  - Do you mind if we come in?
 - Please, please, come on in.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.908
         - Come on in.
     - You got a fish tank?

39:04.910 --> 39:07.010
     Yeah, yeah, saltwater.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.115
     Where's all the fish?

39:12.117 --> 39:15.352
       There's just one.
  I used to call him Neptune.

39:15.354 --> 39:18.488
  - Now I call him Inept-tune.
   - What kind of fish is he?

39:18.490 --> 39:20.957
He's an octo-wuss. Might as well
    be a chocolate starfish.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.059
       He's a shit fish.
       You never see him.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.428
     He just hides all day.

39:25.430 --> 39:28.365
     But <i> that</i> is Plisskin.

39:28.367 --> 39:30.033
     He's a total bad ass,

39:30.035 --> 39:31.835
    always trying to escape
           and shit.

39:31.837 --> 39:35.939
        But breaking out
         is impossible.

39:35.941 --> 39:39.109
     Breaking in is insane.

39:39.111 --> 39:41.544
  That is Peter North Parker,

39:41.546 --> 39:45.115
you know, 'cause he's a spider,
 man, he's just so big and all.

39:45.117 --> 39:47.751
    And this is Claws Meine.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.820
   Let me show you something.
        Check this out.

39:53.958 --> 39:57.861
  That is love at first sting,
          right there.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.497
       Yoohoo! Johnathan!

40:00.499 --> 40:02.165
         He is obsessed
        with the ocean.

40:02.167 --> 40:05.168
  If you had a shark in there,
     he would never leave.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.904
  - Johnathan, you like music?
             - Hmm?

40:07.906 --> 40:10.006
       - You like music?
           - Mm-hmm.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.108
        Check this out.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.878
 Some dude in Austin gave this
   to me for a bag of weed--

40:14.880 --> 40:18.915
        Uh, weed killer.
     Said it was an import.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.187
         You like this?

40:24.189 --> 40:26.122
        I don't like it.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.824
           I <i> love</i> it!

40:27.826 --> 40:29.659
       Well, it's yours.
            Take it.

40:29.661 --> 40:33.563
  - Can I listen to it first?
   - Of course! All you want.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.698
      You wanna go outside
           for a sec?

40:35.700 --> 40:37.100
            - Yeah.
            - Okay.

40:37.102 --> 40:40.570
     Okay. Hey, Johnathan,
     make yourself at home.

40:48.679 --> 40:50.547
           All of it?

40:50.549 --> 40:53.016
             All of it.

40:53.018 --> 40:56.553
       Shit. I only have
      a week's worth left.

40:56.555 --> 40:59.656
          All I got's
     a couple days' worth.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.991
  What about his regular meds?

41:01.993 --> 41:04.794
        I told you about
   the complications he has.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.230
    He just responds better
          to the hydro

41:07.232 --> 41:09.966
       than he does with
    the pharmaceutical crap.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.236
 The only guy I know is Lonny.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.939
 He only sells a quarter pound.

41:15.941 --> 41:18.608
   I can't afford that much.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.710
       We can go in half.

41:20.712 --> 41:23.646
  I can't afford that either.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.648
         Maybe I could
        sell some shit.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.551
     Ratshot owes me some.

41:28.553 --> 41:32.856
        Oh, it's too bad
       we live in Texas.

41:32.858 --> 41:36.960
    If we were on the coast,
hydro would be doctor's orders.

41:36.962 --> 41:38.761
             Yeah.

41:41.832 --> 41:45.235
   Man, you ever think about
         leaving Texas?

41:45.237 --> 41:48.538
       I don't know, man.
        I like it here.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.073
  In Texas, you may have shit,

41:50.075 --> 41:51.908
     but you'll always have
         your dignity.

41:51.910 --> 41:54.878
Here, you can throw your head in
 a toilet bowl, lick it clean,

41:54.880 --> 41:57.146
   that'll at least make you
   the baddest son of a bitch

41:57.148 --> 41:59.215
          in the room.

41:59.217 --> 42:00.850
    How do you figure that?

42:00.852 --> 42:03.953
the Alamo.

42:03.955 --> 42:07.090
Which reminds me, you wanna see
my dad's most prized possession?

42:07.092 --> 42:08.892
         I don't know.
          What is it?

42:08.894 --> 42:11.027
      I'll be right back.

42:51.902 --> 42:55.705
    My old man never let me
    listen to Ozzy Osbourne

42:55.707 --> 42:58.241
       because he pissed
         on the Alamo.

42:58.243 --> 43:01.311
    You'd think Ozzy pissed
     on his mother's grave,

43:01.313 --> 43:03.913
   he's so serious about it.

43:06.884 --> 43:08.785
        Check this out.

43:18.062 --> 43:19.629
          What is it?

43:19.631 --> 43:25.768
 That is an actual musket ball
        from the Alamo.

43:25.770 --> 43:29.372
           Seriously?

43:29.374 --> 43:31.207
            Hell no!

43:31.209 --> 43:33.276
   It's an old fishing weight
        I hammered down.

43:33.278 --> 43:36.012
    I told him it was pried
 from Colonel Travis's bedroom.

43:36.014 --> 43:39.282
  He's so proud of that, you'd
think it was Bowie's own blade.

43:39.284 --> 43:42.051
  I just don't have the balls
      to break his heart,

43:42.053 --> 43:44.654
    tell him the truth now.

43:44.656 --> 43:46.689
  That's really awful, Curtis.

43:46.691 --> 43:51.260
  Aw, the old bastard's happy.
    That's all that matters.

43:51.262 --> 43:53.696
    I wonder how many times
   I've been lied to by a man

43:53.698 --> 43:55.832
     just to make me happy.

43:59.370 --> 44:03.172
     Well, he'd be a fool.

44:07.044 --> 44:09.812
             Shit.

44:09.814 --> 44:11.714
      I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm--
           I'm sorry.

44:11.716 --> 44:14.884
     No, that's-- I mean--
         No, it's fine.

44:14.886 --> 44:17.120
             Uh...

44:17.122 --> 44:19.322
     No. I should probably
         go check on...

44:19.324 --> 44:21.958
       check on Johnathan
          anyway, huh?

44:23.761 --> 44:25.928
             Shit.

44:27.832 --> 44:28.931
          Johnathan...

44:28.933 --> 44:31.134
            - What?
     - What are you doing?

44:31.136 --> 44:34.103
    I'm looking for Neptune,
     but I can't find him.

44:34.105 --> 44:36.739
        I'm telling you
      he's the shyest pet.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.846
       You'll never find
    that lazy water bastard.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.214
      Johnathan, let's go.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.957
<i> Guess what I did today?</i>

44:54.959 --> 44:57.694
         <i> It was a baby,</i>
   <i> but it was the real thing.</i>

44:57.696 --> 45:01.197
   <i> The mom's still out there.</i>

45:01.199 --> 45:03.199
  <i> Sorry you couldn't be there,</i>

45:03.201 --> 45:07.236
   <i> but Grandpa says a hunter</i>
 <i> takes a shot once he has him.</i>

45:07.238 --> 45:09.238
      <i> We have to celebrate</i>
        <i> with jellybeans.</i>

45:09.240 --> 45:10.473
          Jellybeans!

45:15.412 --> 45:17.280
           Mmm, good.

45:18.749 --> 45:20.883
  Nothing like those old ones.

46:41.465 --> 46:44.000
             - Hey.
            - What?

46:44.002 --> 46:46.936
     - What are you doing?
- Looking for something to eat.

46:46.938 --> 46:49.939
    Well, go play, and I'll
     make something to eat.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.201
     Johnathan! No, no, no.

47:18.203 --> 47:20.169
    Wait, wait, wait, wait!

47:20.171 --> 47:22.505
       Hey, you can't use
     the bathroom anymore.

47:22.507 --> 47:23.873
              Why?

47:23.875 --> 47:25.107
      Just don't, please.

47:25.109 --> 47:27.610
        If you gotta go,
     go out back like Dad.

47:27.612 --> 47:31.581
  If you gotta go number two,
 then just go behind the shed.

47:31.583 --> 47:33.316
    Look, I'm serious, okay?

47:33.318 --> 47:37.420
   Go play, and I'll make us
      some oatmeal. Go on.

48:02.913 --> 48:06.182
  Did you put any sugar in it?

48:06.184 --> 48:08.150
      We're out of sugar,
      thank you very much.

48:08.152 --> 48:10.553
  You got any jellybeans left?

48:10.555 --> 48:12.121
             Yeah.

48:12.123 --> 48:15.091
           All right,
      put those in there.

48:15.093 --> 48:17.326
             Gross.

48:20.964 --> 48:23.165
 Why can't we go to Grandpa's?

48:23.167 --> 48:26.235
   Because I told you not to.

48:30.974 --> 48:33.209
     I don't want no more.

49:10.615 --> 49:12.248
     Can I play a song now?

49:12.250 --> 49:14.450
        After we finish
       your scales, okay?

49:14.452 --> 49:15.718
      All right, D-minor.

49:19.390 --> 49:20.623
             - Hi.
    - She made me pull over

49:20.625 --> 49:22.692
   to look at the parakeets.

49:22.694 --> 49:24.593
        No, that's fine.
     They make great pets.

49:24.595 --> 49:27.129
 No, she won't be getting one.
I would have to take care of it.

49:27.131 --> 49:29.165
Oh.

49:29.167 --> 49:30.733
          Hey, Julie.

49:30.735 --> 49:33.169
      No, I couldn't open
        the attachment.

49:33.171 --> 49:35.171
        They're pretty!
          I want one!

49:35.173 --> 49:37.440
     You don't take care of
   your puppy or the turtle.

49:37.442 --> 49:39.542
       The puppy is ugly
    and poops on the floor.

49:39.544 --> 49:43.145
      Turtles are stupid.
       I want a parakeet!

49:43.147 --> 49:44.580
     Which one do you like,
            sweetie?

49:44.582 --> 49:47.049
    - No, Kimmie, let's go.
      - I want a blue one.

49:47.051 --> 49:48.317
       I got yellow ones.

49:48.319 --> 49:50.052
          I don't want
      a stupid yellow one!

49:50.054 --> 49:51.654
      - I want a blue one!
     - Hold on one second.

49:51.656 --> 49:53.622
    Kimmie's about to throw
          a hurricane.

49:53.624 --> 49:56.058
          I don't have
      any blue ones here,

49:56.060 --> 49:57.760
        but I just live
      right up the street.

49:57.762 --> 49:59.028
        We could go get
        a couple there.

49:59.030 --> 50:00.596
  She has a blue one at home!

50:00.598 --> 50:03.032
       Pick one of these
 if you want one, and let's go.

50:04.736 --> 50:07.003
       Stop it! Stop it!

50:07.005 --> 50:09.372
     Stop it right now! No!

50:09.374 --> 50:11.340
          Stop it! No!

50:15.078 --> 50:17.079
   Why do your eyes do this?

50:17.081 --> 50:19.281
        I have nystagmus
         and glaucoma.

50:19.283 --> 50:20.649
              Eww.

50:20.651 --> 50:22.251
     Want some jellybeans?

50:22.253 --> 50:23.753
             Sure.

50:26.757 --> 50:28.758
           Hey, Mama,
     you want a jellybean?

50:28.760 --> 50:31.427
         No, thank you.

50:31.429 --> 50:34.263
      Hey, why'd you take
         my jellybeans?

50:34.265 --> 50:36.098
Come on, Kim!

50:36.100 --> 50:37.233
             Okay.

50:44.674 --> 50:46.542
            Uh, Kim?

50:46.544 --> 50:48.644
You'll have to excuse the place.

50:48.646 --> 50:52.214
     It's a bit of disaster
since my husband's been on tour.

50:52.216 --> 50:53.816
          Oh, really?

50:53.818 --> 50:58.354
       My little brother
       is in Afghanistan.

50:58.356 --> 51:00.423
      Oh, no, my husband's
          a musician.

51:00.425 --> 51:03.159
           Oh, cool.

51:03.161 --> 51:04.460
I'm sorry.

51:04.462 --> 51:06.295
           Excuse me,
      I have to take this.

51:06.297 --> 51:08.531
        Hey, Julie, hey.

51:08.533 --> 51:10.833
         No, I haven't.

51:10.835 --> 51:12.701
       No, hey, shut up,
       shut up, shut up.

51:12.703 --> 51:16.138
      You'll never believe
     where I am right now.

51:26.316 --> 51:29.085
   This is Captain Johnathan
       and first mate Kim

51:29.087 --> 51:31.587
  looking for any sea monsters
          in the area.

51:31.589 --> 51:34.290
 I don't wanna be a first mate.
     I wanna be a mermaid.

51:34.292 --> 51:37.093
  Why a mermaid? Mermaids are
   boring. They don't fight.

51:37.095 --> 51:39.095
         I don't care.
     I wanna be a mermaid.

51:39.097 --> 51:40.796
          Then get in.

51:40.798 --> 51:43.432
   If you wanna be a mermaid,
 you have to get in the ocean.

51:43.434 --> 51:45.501
   I'm not getting in there.

51:46.636 --> 51:48.104
           Watch out!

51:50.474 --> 51:51.607
             - Why?
          - Sea snake!

51:51.609 --> 51:52.675
        Man the harpoon!

51:52.677 --> 51:54.577
Kim!

51:54.579 --> 51:56.378
    It's just an old spring.

51:56.380 --> 51:59.548
   - No, it's a sea serpent.
       - Don't be stupid.

52:03.554 --> 52:05.754
       A pretty bluebird.

52:10.627 --> 52:12.761
          - Thank you.
  - Mom, get it away from me!

52:12.763 --> 52:15.698
  - Here, piggy, piggy, piggy!
     - Get it away from me!

52:15.700 --> 52:18.601
We have to go.
  Be careful. Watch your step.

52:18.603 --> 52:21.537
        Get in the car.

52:21.539 --> 52:23.305
         - We gotta go.
            - Okay.

52:23.307 --> 52:25.307
 - We'll get our own ride back.
        - Are you sure?

52:25.309 --> 52:26.475
       Yeah, that's fine.
          We'll walk.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.810
        Okay, thank you.

52:27.812 --> 52:29.345
              Bye.

52:44.661 --> 52:46.195
         Hey, Grandma!

52:46.197 --> 52:48.364
Well, hey, there, little rascal.
        Where you been?

52:48.366 --> 52:50.366
       You wanna help me
         fix my garden?

52:50.368 --> 52:52.301
             - No.
           - Why not?

52:52.303 --> 52:54.770
      'Cause Mom says that
I couldn't come into your house

52:54.772 --> 52:56.505
         or your yard.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.274
      Why'd she say that?

52:58.276 --> 53:00.843
  I don't know, but can I have
     a drink from the hose?

53:00.845 --> 53:02.778
           Of course.

53:02.780 --> 53:04.380
      But don't tell Mom.

53:04.382 --> 53:06.348
              Why?

53:06.350 --> 53:09.351
        'Cause our water
     got turned off today.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.520
     Well, sure, of course.

53:12.689 --> 53:13.789
             Okay.

53:44.354 --> 53:46.655
<i> "Hello, Jo.</i>

53:46.657 --> 53:48.691
        <i> Well, here I am.</i>

53:48.693 --> 53:51.227
    <i> Better late than never,</i>
            <i> I guess.</i>

53:51.229 --> 53:53.629
            <i> I hope.</i>

53:53.631 --> 53:55.898
     <i> I started to write you</i>
       <i> a thousand times,</i>

53:55.900 --> 54:00.436
         <i> but the words</i>
   <i> just never seemed to fit.</i>

54:00.438 --> 54:05.007
     <i> This morning I woke up</i>
   <i> in a motel room in Memphis</i>

54:05.009 --> 54:09.011
        <i> to the sight of</i>
   <i> one regal little cockroach</i>

54:09.013 --> 54:10.746
     <i> perched on my pillow,</i>

54:10.748 --> 54:12.748
      <i> just staring at me.</i>

54:12.750 --> 54:14.650
     <i> And before I knew it,</i>

54:14.652 --> 54:17.753
    <i> all I could think about</i>
         <i> was Galveston,</i>

54:17.755 --> 54:20.723
 <i> that night we spent together,</i>

54:20.725 --> 54:24.426
  <i> that morning we woke to find</i>
 <i> an entire army of cockroaches</i>

54:24.428 --> 54:27.730
         <i> closing in on</i>
      <i> last night's dinner.</i>

54:27.732 --> 54:30.599
      <i> Our very first taste</i>
          <i> of freedom.</i>

54:30.601 --> 54:34.470
         <i> Everything was</i>
        <i> so simple then,</i>

54:34.472 --> 54:36.972
           <i> so clear.</i>

54:36.974 --> 54:41.377
   <i> It was the one time I knew</i>
     <i> exactly what I wanted.</i>

54:41.379 --> 54:44.046
       <i> I just wanted you.</i>

54:44.048 --> 54:46.915
        <i> I miss you, Jo.</i>

54:46.917 --> 54:50.719
       <i> I do. I know this</i>
     <i> has been hard on you,</i>

54:50.721 --> 54:54.056
     <i> but things really seem</i>
   <i> to be picking up out here.</i>

54:54.058 --> 54:56.625
 <i> The shows are getting better,</i>

54:56.627 --> 55:00.462
  <i> and I finally have a little</i>
    <i> money to send your way.</i>

55:00.464 --> 55:03.632
   <i> I wish I was sending more.</i>

55:03.634 --> 55:07.703
         <i> How's Wee Wee</i>
      <i> and the Wonder Boy?</i>

55:07.705 --> 55:11.940
     <i> I hope he understands.</i>

55:11.942 --> 55:16.645
    <i> I used to see the world</i>
         <i> like he does.</i>

55:16.647 --> 55:18.614
     <i> Now there's a question</i>
        <i> for everything.</i>

55:18.616 --> 55:22.718
      <i> I can't seem to hold</i>
         <i> onto anything.</i>

55:22.720 --> 55:27.456
  <i> I wish I could just go back</i>
  <i> to that motel in Galveston,</i>

55:27.458 --> 55:31.493
      <i> where it made sense.</i>

55:31.495 --> 55:34.963
   <i> I don't know why I can't.</i>

55:34.965 --> 55:38.701
       <i> Maybe I'm broken.</i>

55:38.703 --> 55:41.070
     <i> Maybe I could fix it.</i>

55:41.072 --> 55:46.909
        <i> But for now on,</i>
   <i> I'll just keep searching.</i>

55:46.911 --> 55:48.977
      <i> Searching for you."</i>

56:14.437 --> 56:16.405
            No shit.

56:21.144 --> 56:23.946
          - That's it?
       - I got this too.

56:25.982 --> 56:28.150
            - Dang.
           - I know.

56:28.152 --> 56:30.819
           - Not bad.
            - I know.

56:32.889 --> 56:36.091
    Hmm. Man, it won't scan.

56:36.093 --> 56:38.660
    Something wrong with it?

56:38.662 --> 56:41.029
         I don't know.
   It says you won 200 bucks.

56:41.031 --> 56:43.399
       Hey, Leon, can you
      take a look at this?

56:43.401 --> 56:45.834
          God darn it!
I told you to move that bucket.

56:45.836 --> 56:48.070
 We all gonna be millionaires?

56:48.072 --> 56:49.638
         I don't know.
 I think the scanner's busted.

56:49.640 --> 56:52.040
- You gambling, honey?

56:52.042 --> 56:56.578
 No, this is a Tennessee Lotto.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.080
              Oh.

57:01.851 --> 57:03.852
          So you guys
     can't cash this here?

57:03.854 --> 57:08.891
         Sorry, JoLynn.
  It's only good in Tennessee.

57:13.763 --> 57:15.464
      Come on, Johnathan.

57:15.466 --> 57:17.833
     I'd drive to Tennessee
         for 200 bucks.

57:33.049 --> 57:34.917
           Johnathan!

57:38.455 --> 57:41.156
 Please come take your medicine
     and brush your teeth.

57:41.158 --> 57:43.492
      - Okay. Guess what.
            - What?

57:43.494 --> 57:46.495
    I was just reading that
a lobster doesn't have a brain.

57:46.497 --> 57:49.698
           - Really?
           - Mm-hmm.

57:49.700 --> 57:52.100
        And its kidneys
      are in its forehead,

57:52.102 --> 57:54.736
         and its teeth
      are in its stomach.

57:56.740 --> 57:58.740
          Please chew
    with your mouth closed.

57:58.742 --> 58:00.876
    So if you're ever facing
        a giant lobster,

58:00.878 --> 58:04.246
  I'll bash it in its forehead
          to kill it.

58:04.248 --> 58:07.816
   I am a lucky, lucky woman.

58:12.823 --> 58:16.825
- Okay, go to bed, please.
-          - Oh--

58:30.707 --> 58:34.610
  Please forgive me for being
     a bad wife and mother.

58:36.980 --> 58:40.616
     I know I ain't good at
 giving my child what he needs.

58:45.088 --> 58:47.089
        I promise you...

58:47.091 --> 58:50.158
         I promise you
        I'll be better.

58:51.861 --> 58:56.231
I can't do this on my own.

59:20.823 --> 59:22.157
             - Hi.
             - Hi.

59:22.159 --> 59:24.893
      - Are you Johnathan?
      - Yeah. Who are you?

59:24.895 --> 59:29.331
           I'm Gale.
       Can I talk to you?

59:29.333 --> 59:32.668
      I just wanna ask you
        a few questions.

59:32.670 --> 59:34.670
 I'm friends with your grandma.

59:34.672 --> 59:36.171
             Okay.

59:36.173 --> 59:37.940
     So where's your mama?

59:37.942 --> 59:40.075
            Asleep.

59:40.077 --> 59:41.843
    Have you had breakfast?

59:41.845 --> 59:45.280
    No, but she'll probably
 make oatmeal when she gets up.

59:45.282 --> 59:47.816
You don't like
        oatmeal, do you?

59:47.818 --> 59:49.051
              No.

59:49.053 --> 59:51.954
          I heard that
      you have a pet pig.

59:51.956 --> 59:53.622
         Yeah, Wee Wee.

59:53.624 --> 59:55.624
    And I heard that Wee Wee
    sleeps in your bedroom.

59:55.626 --> 59:58.894
      Sometimes, but Mama
  don't like her in the house.

59:58.896 --> 01:00:01.597
       She doesn't? Hmm.

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:03.799
 Well, can I see your bedroom?

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:09.738
             Okay.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.680
     Who the hell are you?

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:21.183
 I'm Gale with Social Services.

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:24.753
      Step away from her,
           Johnathan.

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:27.122
         I'd advise you
  to put down the gun, ma'am.

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:29.124
       What are you doing
          in my house?

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.926
     I'm just doing my job.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:32.661
     Now, there's no reason
          to be upset.

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:34.663
     Do you have a warrant?

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:35.964
          No, not yet.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:37.966
       Then get the hell
        out of my house!

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:43.038
   I'd advise that you comply
    with our investigation.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.374
    Well, I'd advise you to
 stay the hell off my property.

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:48.276
        Okay, but if you
        don't cooperate,

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:51.947
 I come back with a court order
  and an officer to escort me.

01:00:51.949 --> 01:00:53.949
     Let's talk about this.

01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:57.019
     You stay the hell away
          from my son.

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:05.427
 I don't want you to ever talk
   to that woman again. Ever.

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:04.419
<i> Since the little</i>
      <i> boy's dad was away,</i>

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:07.489
       <i> the mama leviathan</i>
       <i> sent sea monsters</i>

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:10.392
      <i> to attack his home.</i>

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:13.729
  <i> The crab monster came first.</i>

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:21.002
 <i> And then came the big fat one</i>
     <i> with a thousand eyes.</i>

01:02:21.004 --> 01:02:25.774
<i>No matter how many sea monsters</i>
<i>the mama leviathan would bring,</i>

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:29.277
     <i> he will always protect</i>
          <i> his mother.</i>

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:35.784
             - Yes?
    - I'm looking for Mark.

01:02:35.786 --> 01:02:36.852
     He's out back working.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.025
         Hey, stranger.

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:45.227
              Hi.

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:46.495
        Something wrong?

01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:48.497
   Why'd you call CPS on me?

01:02:48.499 --> 01:02:50.165
  What are you talking about?

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:53.201
   I'd expect that from her,
       but not from you.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:54.803
            Oh, boy.

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:58.140
 Yeah, we had a fight about it.

01:02:58.142 --> 01:02:59.474
          Yeah, well,
    they came to the house.

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:01.209
    Well, I'm sorry, JoLynn.

01:03:01.211 --> 01:03:04.412
     This is not my doing.
       This is her thing.

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:07.516
       I happen to think
  you're a pretty good mother.

01:03:07.518 --> 01:03:10.986
    She's just trying to do
   what she thinks is right.

01:03:10.988 --> 01:03:13.555
    Now, I'm in no position
       to judge anybody,

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:16.391
          but the way
      you and David live,

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:20.962
      that is not the way
         we raised him.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:23.398
   Let me show you something.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.001
    Can you see those medals
          right there?

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:29.571
Now, those are my most cherished
     personal possessions,

01:03:29.573 --> 01:03:31.807
       and here they sit
      in this dirty garage

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:37.078
   because they don't go well
     with her knickknacks.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.548
   Sometimes in life you got
    to choose your battles.

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:42.851
        Now, her little
        ceramic trinkets

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:46.321
      may mean more to her
         than those do,

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:52.360
     but those do not mean
   more to me than she does.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.365
      I'm sorry. That's...

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:59.401
 That's the most pathetic thing
        I've ever heard.

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:03.271
            Come on.
     Don't make fun of me.

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.412
    No, I mean she's luckier
     than hell to have you.

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:13.615
         Yeah, she is.

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:23.859
           Hey, uh...

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:26.294
       do you ever think
 you could love somebody else?

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:28.296
       Now, why would you
          ask me that?

01:04:28.298 --> 01:04:33.335
  I mean, do you feel like you
 love her 'cause she's the one?

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:36.638
 Or did you decide long before
 she threw you out in the shed?

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.640
  Frankly I don't see what the
hell difference it makes anyway

01:04:38.642 --> 01:04:41.877
      'cause it's not like
      I'm going anywhere.

01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:45.413
   Sweetie, sometimes in life
 you get to choose your family

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:48.416
    and sometimes you don't.

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:51.519
   But that doesn't make them
        any less family.

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:53.355
       I mean, like you.

01:04:53.357 --> 01:04:57.259
  To me, you are my daughter.

01:04:57.261 --> 01:05:01.096
     You always have been,
    and you always will be.

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:04.900
           And that's
    just the way that is...

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:06.968
       'cause I love you.

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:13.074
       No matter what you
       may decide to do.

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.914
         I owe you more
    than I could ever repay.

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:23.018
 No, you don't owe me anything.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:27.155
           For once,
  I'm offering you something.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:28.990
         I'm listening.

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:33.028
    A freezer full of meat.

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:46.508
        Will you, uh...

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:50.378
     Will you meet me back
   at the generator at 9:00?

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.281
   And don't tell Johnathan.

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:00.488
         I'll be there.

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:17.238
      The only true weapon
for a sea warrior is a trident!

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.207
             - Hey.
        - Like Poseidon.

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:20.642
             What?

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:22.711
     Come sit down with me.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.246
           Come here.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:29.417
       - You having fun?
            - Yeah.

01:06:29.419 --> 01:06:31.553
             Good.

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:34.055
       Hey, you wanna go
       on a trip with me?

01:06:34.057 --> 01:06:35.724
       Where will we go?

01:06:35.726 --> 01:06:37.359
       Wherever we want.

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:39.995
    Can we go to the ocean?

01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:42.364
       Yeah, we can try.

01:06:42.366 --> 01:06:44.766
        When will we go?

01:06:44.768 --> 01:06:46.534
           Tomorrow.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:50.305
         But you gotta
     promise me something.

01:06:50.307 --> 01:06:51.539
             What?

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:54.442
    You can't tell anybody.

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:56.044
            - Okay?
            - Okay.

01:06:56.046 --> 01:06:57.345
           - Promise?
          - I promise.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:58.747
             Okay.

01:06:58.749 --> 01:07:00.382
 It's just gonna be me and you.

01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:03.218
      What about Wee Wee?

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.220
   We'll have to ask Grandpa
      to take care of her.

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:06.688
             Okay.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.690
          Okay, go on.

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:19.634
<i> Once there was</i>
         <i> a little boy,</i>

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:23.571
<i>and him and his mom and his pig</i>
     <i> went out to the ocean,</i>

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:26.808
   <i> and he's trying to protect</i>
   <i> his mom from the leviathan</i>

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:29.077
        <i> 'cause he killed</i>
        <i> her little baby,</i>

01:07:29.079 --> 01:07:30.712
     <i> the leviathan's baby.</i>

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:34.182
      Sharky piggy, piggy,
         piggy, piggy!

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:35.784
            Come on.

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:42.490
       <i> And the leviathan</i>
     <i> is a giant old octopus</i>

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:44.826
   <i> that could stand on land.</i>

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:46.694
       <i> Real sea monster.</i>

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:54.069
       <i> So the little boy</i>
  <i> and Wee Wee the Shark Piggy</i>

01:07:54.071 --> 01:07:56.504
        <i> went to go fight</i>
        <i> this leviathan.</i>

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:03.745
          Wee Wee, no!

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:06.815
   <i> After 5 miles of swimming,</i>

01:08:06.817 --> 01:08:12.587
   <i> digestive systems growling</i>
      <i> for hunger and food,</i>

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:17.625
     <i> this long arm came up</i>
    <i> and scooped up Wee Wee.</i>

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:22.863
   <i> Luckily it didn't eat her</i>
    <i> before I could save her.</i>

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.737
    <i> He said it was worth it</i>
<i>for saving his mom and his pig.</i>

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:32.506
          - Johnathan!
        - What happened?

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:34.209
   You knocked yourself out.

01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:36.211
        Why did you jump
        out of the boat?

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:39.147
         I don't know.
         My eyes hurt.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.483
       Oh, God, not now.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.318
             Okay.

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:53.394
            Curtis!

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.798
        Hey, what's up?
           You okay?

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.367
     Look. Can we come in?
       We need your help.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:02.203
     Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah.

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:11.379
   You sure you want to make
  a nine-year-old take vapors?

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:13.281
           I have to.

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:14.849
      If we don't relieve
         the pressure,

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:17.484
 the damage is permanent, so...

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:21.456
I'm not gonna let him go blind.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:24.626
       All right, listen,
 I want you to open your mouth,

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:27.395
     and I'm gonna blow air
     into your mouth, okay?

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:29.663
             Okay.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.167
    It might make you cough
         a little bit,

01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:34.169
  but I want you to hold it in
      as long as you can.

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:36.171
    Can you do that for me?

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.520
              Hold it.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:54.689
            Hold it.

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:58.960
         - It tickles.
   - I know it tastes funny,

01:09:58.962 --> 01:10:02.697
       but that's 'cause
      it's medicine, okay?

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.465
      You did a good job.

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:07.235
     Now we're gonna do it
  one more time for me, okay?

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.952
 So that phone's gotta be worth
at least a couple hundred bucks.

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:33.288
    And then the scratch-off
      is as good as cash.

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.825
          Where'd you
       get this phone at?

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:41.529
         Don't matter.
   Look, I need this for him.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:46.901
      Okay. I'll do it...
            for you.

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:48.703
           For Johnathan.

01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:50.605
         For Johnathan.

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:07.822
       It's a nice phone.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:08.890
             Yeah.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:15.730
     Hey, Lonny! Hey, man.

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:17.765
    Hey, it's Curtis, yeah.

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:19.834
   Yeah, hey, could you maybe
        come by my place

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:25.673
    and bring that real cute
kewpie doll that I like so much?

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:28.476
       No, the Q.P. doll.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:30.678
       The real nice one.

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:37.752
         Buddy, I need
   a quarter pound of hydro.

01:12:37.754 --> 01:12:39.120
       The best you got.

01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:41.923
     All right, all right.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:45.426
       All right, thanks.
          Bye, buddy.

01:12:45.428 --> 01:12:46.861
  He's gonna call back in 10.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.596
   If we gotta go somewhere,
        you're driving.

01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:50.498
        I can't, Curtis.
      Johnathan's inside.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.834
     - I'm not leaving him.
    - He's passed out cold.

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:54.602
        If he wakes up,
   he'll be fine by himself.

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:57.071
 No, man, if something happens,
         I'll lose him.

01:12:57.073 --> 01:12:59.707
     If something happens,
    I got two DWIs already.

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:02.777
 If I get caught driving again,
      hmm, uh-uh, no way.

01:13:02.779 --> 01:13:05.613
  No way. I am way too pretty
          for prison.

01:13:05.615 --> 01:13:08.049
  No, I'm not driving, Curtis.

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:10.752
            I can't.

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:18.960
   At least you get to drive
  a balls-to-the-wall classic.

01:13:18.962 --> 01:13:21.162
 This is a 300 effin' Z, baby.

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:24.665
        170 horsepower,
     rear wheel drive, V6.

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:27.802
  Man, this car costs $30,000
     when it was brand-new.

01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:29.737
      Yeah, in like 1982.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.940
        Hey, 1986, man.

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:35.610
          Yeah, well,
      what's it worth now?

01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:37.145
           Who cares?
        It's got T-tops.

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:38.913
      Man, they don't even
      make those anymore..

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.783
      And that rear window
          is louvered.

01:13:41.785 --> 01:13:43.951
   - That is some posh shit.
           - Mm-hmm.

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:46.087
       That's like having
   French blinds on your car.

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.688
            Mm-hmm.

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.760
There he is.

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.731
      I'll be right back.

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:03.204
     How you doing, Lonny?

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:06.107
           Shit, man,
     I've had better days.

01:14:06.109 --> 01:14:09.510
       Hey, man, push me
    on this thing, will you?

01:14:09.512 --> 01:14:11.078
            - What?
            - Yeah!

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.516
   I used to love this thing
   when I was a kid. Push me.

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:18.453
             Okay.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.456
       Hey, not so fast.

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:25.026
      Hey, do I look like
    a screaming schoolgirl?

01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:27.128
             Aaah!

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.697
          Now hop on.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.651
   How long has it been since
  you've been on one of these?

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.588
          Been awhile.
   I hate these damn things.

01:14:57.759 --> 01:15:00.895
 I'm sorry, Lonny. I can't stay
 and play in the park all day.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:03.164
        Seriously, I...

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:05.566
           Seriously,
    I think I'm gonna vomit.

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:11.138
         Can we just--
      Can we just do this?

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.207
        It's all there.

01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:17.912
        There's a point
        in a man's life

01:15:17.914 --> 01:15:21.215
    when he yearns to enjoy
       a place like this.

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.521
    Is everything all right?

01:15:26.523 --> 01:15:28.656
        See you around.

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:34.529
         Sorry, Curtis.

01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:36.597
      Sometimes you gotta
       throw a dog a bone

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:39.066
         or else he'll
       come after yours.

01:15:46.074 --> 01:15:47.308
          Oh, my God.

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.613
                Hey!

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:54.749
              Hey!

01:17:29.878 --> 01:17:31.879
              Mom!

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:36.651
              Mom!

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:44.325
                Mom!

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:45.860
              Mom!

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:48.963
Mom!

01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:14.348
           Johnathan!

01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:19.754
Johnathan!

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:22.189
        Can you hear me?
       Go to the window!

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:25.226
        Open the window.

01:19:25.228 --> 01:19:27.094
    Come on, get your stuff.
         We gotta go..

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:30.331
             - Why?
        - Do it, please.

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:34.902
Where's Curtis?

01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:37.772
 He had to go help some people.

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:43.043
  - What are you looking for?
       - It don't matter.

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:49.150
           <i> Hot dogs!</i>
      <i> Grab your hot dogs!</i>

01:19:49.152 --> 01:19:52.019
  <i> Get your mustard and relish.</i>
     <i> Get your fixings here.</i>

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:00.861
         Sorry, Curtis.

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:04.832
       Come on, let's go.

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:11.572
- Are you gonna answer it, Mama?
    - No, just pedal faster.

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:22.817
  - Go get your clothes, okay?
             - Why?

01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:24.251
          Just do it!

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:35.196
<i> Is that you?</i>

01:20:35.198 --> 01:20:36.297
         Yeah, it's me.

01:20:36.299 --> 01:20:37.331
              <i> Oh.</i>

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.467
           I'm sorry.

01:20:40.469 --> 01:20:42.303
       - I'm-- I'm real--
             -<i> No.</i>

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:44.138
       Listen, I'm sorry.
     This is all my fault.

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.506
      Don't say anything.

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:47.374
          I don't know
     if they're listening.

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:49.276
    But if you bastards are,
       I want you to know

01:20:49.278 --> 01:20:54.281
      what you don't find
        was never there.

01:20:54.283 --> 01:20:57.084
        I got to go now.

01:20:57.086 --> 01:21:01.088
      <i> I don't know if they</i>
     <i> can trace this, but...</i>

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:03.424
     don't worry about me.

01:21:03.426 --> 01:21:07.261
  <i> They don't know who you are.</i>

01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:10.164
            <i> I just--</i>

01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:13.100
      I just called to say
        that you and...

01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:18.439
    and your special someone
           are safe.

01:21:20.576 --> 01:21:23.577
   <i> I would never do anything</i>
          <i> to hurt you.</i>

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:28.582
   Thank you so much, Curtis.
     I can never repay you.

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:29.884
           <i> Thank you.</i>

01:21:29.886 --> 01:21:32.219
              No.

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.288
          I got to go.

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.192
           Bye, girl.

01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:41.896
              Bye.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:06.987
    - Let's make some noise.
             - How?

01:22:06.989 --> 01:22:10.391
        A lot of noise.
    Let's put on a concert.

01:22:10.393 --> 01:22:13.327
          - Like Dad?
    - No. We'll wear makeup.

01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:15.462
          Eww. Makeup?

01:22:15.464 --> 01:22:19.700
  Yeah. Boys wear makeup too.
           On stage.

01:22:19.702 --> 01:22:22.670
             - Why?
    - So girls can see 'em.

01:22:22.672 --> 01:22:26.240
     But I don't want girls
           to see me.

01:22:26.242 --> 01:22:28.976
  So their mamas can see them.

01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:36.951
        Close your eyes.

01:22:58.006 --> 01:23:02.009
 Shake your head and go crazy!
             Yeah!

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:20.561
     Hey, I gotta go check
       on the generator!

01:23:20.563 --> 01:23:23.597
            - Okay!
   - Keep the concert going!

01:23:23.599 --> 01:23:25.032
             Okay!

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:30.738
        Go crazy! Whoo!

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:37.244
            Come on.

01:23:39.614 --> 01:23:42.082
- Good girl.

01:23:42.084 --> 01:23:44.118
         Yeah, come on.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:48.622
        Come on. I know.
     I know, honey. I know.

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:56.463
    Mark, you can't do this.

01:23:56.465 --> 01:23:58.699
    Will you put that away?

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:08.275
        Get on in there.
   That a girl, that a girl.

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:15.082
        I'm sorry, girl.

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:25.492
           I'm sorry.

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:28.462
         Do it, JoLynn.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:59.827
          - Johnathan!
           - Grandpa!

01:24:59.829 --> 01:25:01.295
         - Johnathan!
            - What?

01:25:01.297 --> 01:25:04.198
   Get your ass back up here!

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.667
    Come on! Stay away from
 the generator. It's dangerous.

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.303
       Was that Grandpa?

01:25:09.305 --> 01:25:12.139
No. It's none of your business.
            Come on.

01:25:12.141 --> 01:25:14.475
    Don't do that to my arm.
           It hurts.

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:17.678
           I'm sorry.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:21.682
  Grandpa had to take Wee Wee,
      so let's go inside.

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:40.234
      - Can you feel that?
           - Mm-hmm.

01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:42.136
       Does it feel good?

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:46.907
     You gotta push harder.
     That's just like I do.

01:25:46.909 --> 01:25:50.711
   Oh, yeah, that feels good.
  Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

01:25:50.713 --> 01:25:54.148
  - You got cute little feet.
          - Thank you.

01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:56.150
        They're stinky,
       but they're cute.

01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:01.722
   They're coming to get you.

01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:03.690
        Yeah, monsters.

01:26:03.692 --> 01:26:05.659
             Raah!

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:13.600
   This little piggy monster
went to the stinky fish market.

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:16.637
   This little piggy monster
            said no.

01:26:16.639 --> 01:26:18.372
       This little piggy
         had some ham.

01:26:18.374 --> 01:26:22.809
  This little piggy had none.
              Aww!

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:25.846
    This little piggy went,
 "Wee wee wee wee wee wee wee!"

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:29.283
       all the way home.

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:35.389
      What'd I say, Mama?

01:26:35.391 --> 01:26:37.324
         What's wrong?

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:44.198
      Mama, what's wrong?

01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:50.837
  Everything's gonna be okay.

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.488
          Everything's
      gonna be okay, Mama.

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:20.701
          Everything's
      gonna be all right.

01:27:20.703 --> 01:27:22.869
            Promise.

01:27:22.871 --> 01:27:25.872
         - You promise?
          - I promise.

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:31.245
           You okay?

01:27:31.247 --> 01:27:32.813
             Yeah.

01:27:35.984 --> 01:27:37.484
        Come here, baby.

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:40.854
    Come lie down with Mama.

01:28:12.688 --> 01:28:15.055
Come on.

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:49.690
           Johnathan!

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:55.562
      - Morning, Captain.
           - Morning.

01:28:55.564 --> 01:28:57.731
         - You hungry?
           - Mm-hmm.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.668
     Shall we say a prayer?

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:03.870
   God is great, God is good.
  Thanks for the food, Jesus.

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:05.672
            - Amen.
            - Amen.

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:08.942
     Eat all your medicine.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.548
         - Is it good?
           - Mm-hmm.

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:28.428
          - You ready?
            - Ready.

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:33.834
  - Can I ask you a question?
           - Mm-hmm.

01:29:33.836 --> 01:29:36.970
       Why don't we just
     let the parakeets go?

01:29:36.972 --> 01:29:39.673
   They'll die if we do that.

01:29:39.675 --> 01:29:41.775
     It's better this way.

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.681
         Wait, hold up.

01:29:56.824 --> 01:29:59.993
<i> "Jo...</i>

01:29:59.995 --> 01:30:03.430
      <i> I found the bottom.</i>

01:30:03.432 --> 01:30:07.067
   <i> And it's in the same place</i>
       <i> it's always been.</i>

01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:12.072
           <i> I'm sorry</i>
    <i> I put you through this.</i>

01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:15.409
       <i> I thought this was</i>
         <i> what I wanted.</i>

01:30:15.411 --> 01:30:18.612
     <i> But I want my family.</i>

01:30:18.614 --> 01:30:23.683
       <i> I need my family.</i>
        <i> I'm coming home.</i>

01:30:23.685 --> 01:30:26.420
  <i> And if you let me, I'll make</i>
 <i> this up to you and Johnathan.</i>

01:30:26.422 --> 01:30:28.188
           <i> I promise.</i>

01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:29.923
  <i> If you get this before I do,</i>

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:32.626
          <i> I should be</i>
    <i> just around the corner.</i>

01:30:32.628 --> 01:30:35.429
          <i> So we'll see</i>
     <i> who gets there faster,</i>

01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:37.764
        <i> me or my words.</i>

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:40.567
      <i> I love you. David."</i>

01:30:40.569 --> 01:30:42.602
  Hey, if I give you a dollar,
     would you put a stamp

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:44.471
         and throw that
      in the mail for me?

01:30:44.473 --> 01:30:45.739
           I got it.

01:30:45.741 --> 01:30:48.041
           - Thanks.
          - Thank you.

01:30:48.043 --> 01:30:50.677
  - Johnathan, are you ready?
           - Mm-hmm.

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.681
          What tickets
     do you have available

01:30:54.683 --> 01:30:56.516
 that will get us to the beach?

01:30:56.518 --> 01:30:59.453
    - One way or round trip?
       - One way, please.

01:30:59.455 --> 01:31:01.087
             Okay.

01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:06.560
         Well, Miami...
    for an adult and a child

01:31:06.562 --> 01:31:11.932
       would be $367.50,

01:31:11.934 --> 01:31:17.671
       and for San Diego,
      it would be $409.50.

01:31:17.673 --> 01:31:20.640
         Okay. You got
       anything cheaper?

01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:23.643
      Well, there's always
           Galveston.

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:27.881
           How much?

01:31:27.883 --> 01:31:31.952
   Galveston would be $90.25.

01:31:31.954 --> 01:31:33.253
            Perfect.

01:31:33.255 --> 01:31:36.556
 You know, I'm gonna help you.

01:31:36.558 --> 01:31:38.792
       I got the quarter.

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:55.141
<i> Once there was a little boy,</i>

01:31:55.143 --> 01:31:58.545
<i>and he got a little piglet once</i>
  <i> he was only five years old.</i>

01:31:58.547 --> 01:32:01.982
        One, two, three.

01:32:01.984 --> 01:32:04.651
    <i> Once he was nine or so,</i>

01:32:04.653 --> 01:32:08.054
  <i> him and his mom and his pig</i>
     <i> went out to the ocean</i>

01:32:08.056 --> 01:32:10.690
    <i> 'cause he loves the sea.</i>

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:14.060
    <i> And him and Sharky Piggy</i>

01:32:14.062 --> 01:32:17.531
        <i> went to go find</i>
     <i> the little boy's dad.</i>

01:32:17.533 --> 01:32:19.599
   <i> He was lost in the ocean.</i>

01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:24.204
   <i> But instead they ran into</i>
      <i> the mama leviathan.</i>

01:32:24.206 --> 01:32:29.643
    <i> In anger, the leviathan</i>
       <i> tried to kill us,</i>

01:32:29.645 --> 01:32:31.678
      <i> and he had to fight</i>
         <i> to the death.</i>

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.548
   <i> And I kept on stabbing it</i>

01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:38.752
        <i> and stabbing it</i>
        <i> and stabbing it.</i>

01:32:38.754 --> 01:32:41.054
        <i> Stupid octopus.</i>

01:32:44.058 --> 01:32:48.828
 <i> They lived happily ever after</i>
 <i> with eating octopus every day.</i>
