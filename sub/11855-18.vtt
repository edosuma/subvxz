WEBVTT

00:15.333 --> 00:16.875
What are you gonna eat, Mommy?

00:16.959 --> 00:19.583
Mommy already had her lunch.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.375
No cheese, right?

00:21.458 --> 00:23.125
Can we go
ice skating after?

00:23.208 --> 00:25.083
No.

00:25.166 --> 00:28.625
- Hot!
- Let it cool, baby.

00:28.709 --> 00:31.125
- Can we?
- No, Haley.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.458
What's wrong?

00:35.542 --> 00:38.041
They make these
so hard to open.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.583
Why can't we go ice skating?

00:39.667 --> 00:40.834
You don't wanna be
like those awful girls

00:40.917 --> 00:41.917
Nancy and Tonya, do you?

00:42.041 --> 00:43.875
No, I wanna be like you.

00:46.709 --> 00:49.458
- No!
- It's ketchup, Ryan.

00:49.542 --> 00:51.750
He doesn't like ketchup.
He likes mayonnaise.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.125
(Haley)
'Ryan!'

00:56.208 --> 00:57.625
'He took his lid off!'

00:57.709 --> 00:59.125
Share your drink
with him, Haley.

00:59.208 --> 01:02.166
- Ugh, mom!
- I don't wanna hear it.

01:05.792 --> 01:08.041
(Haley)
'Daddy says you're
a good ice skater.'

01:08.125 --> 01:10.041
Why don't you ever
wanna skate with us?

01:14.083 --> 01:16.959
Finish your food, alright?
I'll be back in a few
minutes.

02:14.792 --> 02:16.959
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.583
Did you take my Tastykakes?

02:25.667 --> 02:27.375
Nah.

02:29.166 --> 02:31.333
Man, I never do.

02:31.417 --> 02:32.625
I've seen you.

02:35.417 --> 02:37.625
There's strudel.
Eat that.

03:00.166 --> 03:01.208
Can I help you?

03:01.291 --> 03:03.333
This is where
the detectives are?

03:03.417 --> 03:06.750
- 'From Homicide.'
- 'I'm looking for Nick
Vera.'

03:06.834 --> 03:08.417
He should be here, um..

03:08.500 --> 03:12.083
I-I knew him in high school.

03:12.166 --> 03:14.959
He might be in court.
Do you wanna leave a note?

03:15.041 --> 03:16.583
Maybe I could talk to you.

03:16.667 --> 03:17.709
Is it about a murder?

03:17.792 --> 03:19.917
My sister.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.333
Ten years ago.

03:23.125 --> 03:25.250
- What was her name?
- Sloane Easton.

03:25.333 --> 03:26.583
'She was found in
the parking lot'

03:26.667 --> 03:28.083
'of the bar
where she worked.'

03:28.166 --> 03:29.959
(Rush)
'How'd she die?'

03:30.041 --> 03:32.458
Cops said she passed out.

03:32.542 --> 03:33.583
Died of exposure.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.875
Was she drunk at the time?

03:35.959 --> 03:39.834
Um...she was always drunk.

03:39.917 --> 03:40.834
Okay.

03:40.917 --> 03:42.792
We figured..

03:42.875 --> 03:45.000
...she just slipped and fell.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.625
The whole thing was an accident.

03:47.709 --> 03:49.667
But you think differently now?

03:49.750 --> 03:52.500
I met this guy
Evan last
night..

03:52.583 --> 03:54.542
...said he knew Sloane.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.625
- From where?
- The bar.

03:56.709 --> 03:58.625
He was a student
at the time.

03:58.709 --> 04:00.750
He was there..

04:00.834 --> 04:02.583
...the night she died.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.208
He see something significant?

04:04.291 --> 04:05.959
Sloane was..

04:06.041 --> 04:07.375
...drinking with
some college guys

04:07.458 --> 04:11.291
and uh, things may
have gotten out of hand.

04:11.375 --> 04:12.917
(Rush)
'He know these guys?'

04:13.000 --> 04:14.625
(female #1)
'They were his
fraternity brothers.'

04:14.709 --> 04:16.417
I should talk to Evan.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.750
Um, he's staying
at the Delaware.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.500
Gave me his number.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.250
Who is this girl?

04:30.875 --> 04:33.667
Megan Easton.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.583
Yeah?

04:35.667 --> 04:39.083
We went to Immaculata together.

04:39.166 --> 04:41.166
Is she wearing a wedding ring?

04:41.250 --> 04:43.625
I don't got my binoculars.

04:43.709 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.333
What'd you do to her?

04:46.417 --> 04:49.291
You gotta hide
from her like a kid?

04:52.417 --> 04:54.959
I was in love with her.

05:27.750 --> 05:30.041
Sloane Easton, 32.

05:30.125 --> 05:33.875
Homeless guy found her in the
parking lot of Sansom's
Tavern.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.250
The autopsy shows
an injury to the head.

05:36.333 --> 05:39.667
Alcohol content was .24.

05:39.750 --> 05:40.709
That's pretty toasted.

05:40.792 --> 05:41.917
So, they figured she's

05:42.000 --> 05:43.750
stumbling drunk,
falls on her face

05:43.834 --> 05:45.417
and stays there.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.875
Temperature was..

05:46.959 --> 05:48.792
...16 degrees that night.

05:48.875 --> 05:50.375
Cold was the ultimate doer.

05:50.458 --> 05:52.583
Maybe the frat
guys
gave the assist.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.583
This girl was the
goods in high school.

05:54.667 --> 05:57.291
Homecoming queen, all that.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.083
You can tell she was pretty.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.875
(Stillman)
'They found blood on her
coat.'

06:00.959 --> 06:02.166
Never ran it.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.417
Well, let's run it now.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.417
Anything on family?

06:06.500 --> 06:07.917
Separated from
her husband, Seth.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.500
He was in New Jersey
that night.

06:09.583 --> 06:12.041
- Uh, two little kids.
- Well, I'll start with
Evan.

06:12.125 --> 06:15.375
See if he knows how
Sloane got knocked in the head.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.375
You know the sister, eh, Nicky?

06:17.458 --> 06:19.417
Megan. We haven't been in touch.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.542
She asked for you.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.542
I don't wanna see her.

06:25.709 --> 06:28.417
Kind of gone
to the dogs here.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.625
You got a full head
of hair, Nick.

06:30.709 --> 06:33.208
I'll follow this up.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.125
(male #1)
'Ah, I'm glad to help.'

06:40.208 --> 06:41.542
- Honestly.
- Good.

06:41.625 --> 06:43.375
But I'm in a rush
to get back to Washington.

06:43.458 --> 06:45.208
Well, then, we'll be quick.

06:45.291 --> 06:46.542
What do you know
about Sloane Easton

06:46.625 --> 06:48.417
ending up dead
outside of that bar?

06:48.500 --> 06:49.792
Nothing, really.

06:49.875 --> 06:52.625
Then why were you talking
about it last night?

06:52.709 --> 06:55.375
That is your writing, isn't it?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.917
But I don't really
know what happened.

06:58.041 --> 07:00.834
Tell us what you do know.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.625
All I remember is..

07:02.709 --> 07:04.709
...she was pretty and drunk

07:04.792 --> 07:06.917
and hanging out
with Garrett
Caine.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.709
That was a bad
combination.

07:08.792 --> 07:09.750
Who's Garrett?

07:09.834 --> 07:11.542
President of our fraternity.

07:11.625 --> 07:14.166
He kind of became known
as a guy to stay away from.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.166
- Why is that?
- He was rough...with women.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.792
You see him get rough
with Sloane that night?

07:19.875 --> 07:22.083
I spent four years
with these guys.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.333
I knew what
the lead-up looked like.

07:24.417 --> 07:25.834
Pitcher of Rolling Rock.

07:28.792 --> 07:31.875
- Nice hat.
- Thanks.

07:31.959 --> 07:33.834
You a suffragette?

07:33.917 --> 07:35.542
Yeah, I'm gonna go vote
right after this.

07:36.667 --> 07:37.667
(Garrett)
'I'm Garrett.'

07:40.917 --> 07:43.458
Alright. Who are you?

07:43.542 --> 07:45.709
- I'm just here to drink.
- 'Then let me buy you one.'

07:45.792 --> 07:47.000
(Sloane)
'I'm only here for a
minute.'

07:48.667 --> 07:51.166
- How you doing, Sloane?
- Oh, Lord.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.250
- How many you had?
- I don't wanna see you.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.208
You need me to drive you home?

07:56.959 --> 07:59.333
Hey, are you getting that drink?

07:59.417 --> 08:00.792
Yeah, I'm getting it.

08:02.208 --> 08:04.542
Rick, make my night and get the
heck out of here, okay?

08:04.625 --> 08:09.125
- Do you wanna sit with us?
- Yeah.

08:09.208 --> 08:11.542
- For you.
- I have your number.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.750
I'm not scared
of a 3:00 a.m. phone call.

08:17.083 --> 08:20.041
- So, it's-it's Sloane, huh?
- Yeah.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.291
Do you like the beach, Sloane?

08:24.834 --> 08:26.834
I knew where
things were headed.

08:26.917 --> 08:29.458
I told Garrett
I had to go study.

08:29.542 --> 08:30.583
That's all I saw.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.166
You guys ever see
this Rick before?

08:33.250 --> 08:34.125
Nah.

08:34.208 --> 08:35.583
Was this a town and gown

08:35.667 --> 08:37.083
thing with Garrett?

08:37.166 --> 08:39.709
Rich college boy slumming
with some local tail?

08:39.792 --> 08:42.500
It was a Zeke thing.
Beach Night.

08:42.583 --> 08:45.125
What's that?

08:45.208 --> 08:46.375
We had a room
called The Beach

08:46.458 --> 08:48.583
where guys
could bring a girl

08:48.667 --> 08:50.750
do it with her while a bunch
of other guys watched.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.083
Unbeknownst to her.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.625
- Of course.
- Sounds like a riot.

08:54.709 --> 08:56.917
We were jerks.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.625
So, you guys were looking
for someone to beach.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.959
And it looked like Garrett
had chosen this girl.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.542
You can't hold a guy responsible

09:12.625 --> 09:14.583
for something that
happened ten years ago.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.625
Actually, you can.

09:16.709 --> 09:17.792
We do it all the time.

09:17.875 --> 09:20.166
Guys, it was a
fraternity
thing.

09:20.250 --> 09:22.291
Beach Night.

09:22.375 --> 09:23.625
How'd you know about that?

09:23.709 --> 09:25.458
Oh, we pick stuff up.

09:25.542 --> 09:27.917
So, maybe we thought
this girl was up for a walk

09:28.000 --> 09:29.875
on the wild side.
There's no crime there.

09:29.959 --> 09:31.709
(Rush)
'So you ply her
with drinks'

09:31.792 --> 09:33.125
talk nice to her,
and invite her

09:33.208 --> 09:34.208
back to the house?

09:34.291 --> 09:35.375
Some version of that.

09:35.458 --> 09:36.959
But she never makes it.

09:37.041 --> 09:39.291
Maybe tries to resist you
in the parking lot.

09:39.375 --> 09:41.917
You rough her up a little,
then leave her in the snow.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.333
'Cause you get
rough with women...what we
hear.

09:45.417 --> 09:48.667
No. We didn't close the deal.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.166
- Sarajevo!
- Lillehammer.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.834
- Lake Placid.
- It wasn't an Olympic city.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.000
- 1980.
- No.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.000
- Yes.
- She's right, Garrett.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.542
No. Bull. Drink.

09:57.625 --> 10:00.333
I almost went there,
as a skater.

10:00.417 --> 10:01.875
(Garrett)
'Sure, you did.'

10:01.959 --> 10:02.875
Me, too.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.500
Well, it's been real, guys.

10:10.458 --> 10:11.750
Why don't you go back
to the house with us?

10:11.834 --> 10:13.250
- No, I got to be someplace.
- No, hey.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.792
We got a keg at the house.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.083
(Sloane)
'Sorry.'

10:16.166 --> 10:17.542
Come on, just for an hour.

10:17.625 --> 10:19.375
Hey, save it
for
the Tri-Delts.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.792
- Hey, let's go back here.
- I said I gotta go.

10:21.875 --> 10:23.000
We're sick of college girls.

10:23.083 --> 10:26.083
- Hey, man, don't touch me.
- Shh.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.875
- Get off me!
- Shh.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.875
- Oh!
- Philly PD.

10:31.834 --> 10:33.542
Back to campus, boys.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.041
Just having some fun, officer.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.125
Walk out of here.

10:37.208 --> 10:38.750
Now!

10:40.208 --> 10:43.500
This cop just showed up
out of the blue? Broke it up?

10:43.583 --> 10:45.417
And we left. That's it.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.917
You know Sloane
ended up dead that night?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.542
Vaguely remember hearing that.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.709
Oh, she was just
a lush from West Philly.

10:51.792 --> 10:53.583
Eh? Who cares?

10:55.166 --> 10:59.291
Hey, how'd, uh,
Beach Night work out for you?

10:59.375 --> 11:01.792
Not allowed to say, amigo.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.750
Lab found two types
of blood on Sloane's coat.

11:12.834 --> 11:15.250
One's hers, one's unidentified.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.375
Maybe the doer's.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.250
Good luck getting
that jackass Garrett

11:18.333 --> 11:19.542
to give blood.

11:19.625 --> 11:20.875
I'll call the ME.

11:20.959 --> 11:21.959
get a rush job going.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.792
Hmm, we know who this guy

11:23.875 --> 11:26.500
at the bar was
offered to drive her
home?

11:26.583 --> 11:27.834
Someone named Rick.

11:27.917 --> 11:29.000
The sister might know him.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.875
Why don't you ask her, Nicky?

11:30.959 --> 11:32.959
- Can't someone else?
- Nope.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.291
Julia Owens from South.

11:35.375 --> 11:37.959
'Our mystery cop at
the tavern that night.'

11:38.041 --> 11:39.083
How you doing?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.875
You worked West
in '95, Julia?

11:40.959 --> 11:42.625
Narcotics. I knew
your victim, Sloane.

11:42.709 --> 11:45.125
Just happened to be at Sansom's
when she got in trouble?

11:45.208 --> 11:47.834
- Nah, I was there to see
her.
- 'How come?'

11:47.917 --> 11:49.458
Sloane got a DUI in '94.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.583
Drove her car
into a newsstand on Broad.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.417
Wanted it off
her record, guess
what?

11:53.500 --> 11:55.625
- We made a deal.
- What kind of deal?

11:55.709 --> 11:58.291
Owner of Sansom's
was slinging out of that
place.

11:58.375 --> 12:00.583
She had a front-row seat
to the action.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.375
So, she was working for you.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.125
She was my CI.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.500
(Megan)
'Nicky.'

12:22.583 --> 12:24.583
Hi.

12:24.667 --> 12:27.125
- Long time.
- No kidding.

12:27.208 --> 12:28.959
You never come
to the reunions.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.875
I'm pretty busy.

12:32.417 --> 12:33.500
You look good.

12:33.583 --> 12:36.125
I'm on a diet.

12:36.208 --> 12:38.458
I'm sorry about Sloane.

12:38.542 --> 12:41.125
Yeah. It was bad.

12:41.208 --> 12:44.750
Uh, we-we found some
things out, um..

12:47.417 --> 12:49.375
Did you know
she-she got a DUI?

12:49.458 --> 12:51.667
- The newsstand thing?
- Yeah.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.667
It's why her
husband
finally left her.

12:53.750 --> 12:57.000
- The kids were in the car.
- Rough.

12:57.083 --> 13:01.000
Well...she was
always a party girl.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.959
She started
working
for the cops

13:03.041 --> 13:04.500
informing on her boss.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.250
I didn't know that

13:06.333 --> 13:10.500
but I guess there was a lot
I didn't know, by the end.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.625
Any idea if she had
a boyfriend or anything?

13:12.709 --> 13:14.083
I don't think so. Why?

13:14.166 --> 13:16.458
There was someone
there that night...Rick.

13:16.542 --> 13:18.542
Oh, uh, Rick
wasn't
her boyfriend.

13:18.625 --> 13:19.875
He was her sponsor.

13:19.959 --> 13:21.500
Do you know where
we can find him?

13:21.583 --> 13:24.542
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.375
You look exactly the same.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.208
Yeah?

13:34.291 --> 13:36.709
You think I'd pass
for a high school
girl?

13:38.333 --> 13:40.917
To me, you would.

13:48.917 --> 13:51.250
I came here every week,
gave her my card.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.333
Every week,
she'd toss
it.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.000
This is where she was found

13:55.083 --> 13:56.250
by that dumpster.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.041
It's a crummy place
to come to your end.

13:58.125 --> 14:00.834
A bar's the last place
she should've been
working.

14:00.917 --> 14:03.542
Go talk to the owner?

14:03.625 --> 14:07.041
Did Sloane seem upset about
anything that night, scared?

14:07.125 --> 14:09.375
She seemed just like the
stubborn drunk she was.

14:09.458 --> 14:10.500
You call her that to her face?

14:10.583 --> 14:11.625
Yeah.

14:11.709 --> 14:12.750
I thought I'd get
through one day.

14:12.834 --> 14:13.959
I really...thought

14:14.041 --> 14:15.583
I could save her.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.583
Well, people have
to save themselves.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.250
Sounds like you've
been
in the program.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.208
Well, we run
into it a lot, you know.

14:22.291 --> 14:23.333
Cops.

14:23.417 --> 14:26.083
Uh-huh. Stressful job.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.583
Oh, what do you know
about this bar owner

14:28.667 --> 14:30.375
um, Powell?

14:30.458 --> 14:32.583
I know he hired
an alcoholic to serve
drinks.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.125
That's pretty shady.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.875
Did Sloane ever make
a real effort

14:36.000 --> 14:37.417
to kick the booze?

14:37.500 --> 14:39.458
No. She came
to one
meeting.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.792
But you were pretty
persistent with her.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.959
Helping other
people
keeps me sober.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.291
Okay, Rick.

14:48.375 --> 14:50.291
I noticed you didn't
answer my question.

14:50.375 --> 14:53.000
Uh, about the program.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.792
If you ever wanna talk

14:54.875 --> 14:57.291
I'm not scared of
a 3:00 a.m. phone
call.

14:59.792 --> 15:01.709
Something happen
in the
neighborhood?

15:01.792 --> 15:05.000
Something happened
here, ten years back?

15:05.083 --> 15:07.333
Sloane Easton?

15:07.417 --> 15:09.792
There's a sorry case.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.125
(Jeffries)
'Worked for you, right?'

15:12.208 --> 15:14.917
Drank more than she poured.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.625
She do any of the drugs
you were dealing?

15:18.709 --> 15:20.125
That's ancient history.

15:20.208 --> 15:22.000
Sloane worked
for the cops, too.

15:22.083 --> 15:24.250
Informing on you
and your side business.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.750
You saying
she was snitching on me?

15:25.834 --> 15:27.166
Which gives you motive
to hurt her.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.250
Then she ends up dead
in your parking lot.

15:29.333 --> 15:30.458
Lousy drunk.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.500
Maybe you found out
she was a CI.?

15:32.583 --> 15:35.250
If I had, I would've hurt her.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.041
You two get
in a lot of disputes?

15:37.125 --> 15:39.667
She was a pain in the ass,
but I never touched her.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.375
So who did have it out for her?

15:41.458 --> 15:43.417
That night?

15:43.500 --> 15:44.333
Her ex.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.917
- 'Seth?'
- Yeah.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.417
Can't say that I blamed him,
after what she did.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.667
Come on. Don't do that.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.083
You want another, just ask.

16:02.208 --> 16:03.417
He's real hungry, Powell.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.291
I need him that way.

16:10.291 --> 16:12.667
Come on.

16:12.750 --> 16:14.208
- Damn it, Sloane!
- Seth?

16:14.291 --> 16:15.458
Do you know where the kids are?

16:15.542 --> 16:16.875
- Don't you have them?
- No, Sloane.

16:16.959 --> 16:18.208
You had 'em.

16:20.125 --> 16:22.041
You left them
at Rodeo
Rob's.

16:22.125 --> 16:26.125
- Just for 15 minutes.
- Five hours!

16:26.208 --> 16:27.625
I just needed one drink.

16:27.709 --> 16:29.583
- I lost track of time.
- You're unbelievable.

16:29.667 --> 16:32.166
- Where are they?
- Don't pretend you care.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.375
I wanna see 'em!
Are they outside?

16:33.458 --> 16:35.333
- Forget it!
- They're my kids.

16:35.417 --> 16:36.625
And you're never
seeing them
again.

16:36.709 --> 16:37.667
You can't do this!

16:37.750 --> 16:40.625
Sloane. Stay away from us.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.583
Seth was supposed to be
in New Jersey that night.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.291
No, he was right here.

16:51.375 --> 16:52.875
And pretty heated up, huh?

16:52.959 --> 16:54.333
Wouldn't you be?

16:54.417 --> 16:55.709
Girl was a disaster.

16:55.792 --> 16:58.417
You willing to give up
some blood, Powell?

16:58.500 --> 16:59.500
What for?

16:59.583 --> 17:00.917
Eliminate you
from the suspect pool.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.083
No way. You ain't
pinching me for this.

17:03.166 --> 17:05.250
Well, saying no looks
pretty suspicious.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.083
So, suspect me.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.625
It says here
you were at the shore

17:12.709 --> 17:14.250
the night Sloane died.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.583
- That a mistake, Seth?
- No.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.333
- That the truth?
- Yeah.

17:19.417 --> 17:21.458
We have a witness
says otherwise.

17:21.542 --> 17:24.458
Says you were at Sansom's,
in fact, giving Sloane hell

17:24.542 --> 17:26.792
for leaving the
kids
down the street.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.291
- Who said that?
- That's not important.

17:32.917 --> 17:34.875
We had a bad fight
when I was there.

17:34.959 --> 17:36.917
So we hear.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.792
I even put my hands on her.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.166
And the next day, she's
dead.
I know how that looks.

17:43.250 --> 17:47.709
So you were in Philly,
at Sansom's.

17:47.792 --> 17:51.291
I went to Jersey later
with my girlfriend, Rose.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.500
Look, why does
it matter, anyway?

17:55.583 --> 17:56.875
She died of her own drunkenness.

17:56.959 --> 17:58.917
We think someone
helped her along.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.125
How do you mean?

18:00.208 --> 18:01.709
Someone tangled
with her that night

18:01.792 --> 18:04.208
smacked her in the head.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.333
She followed you
out to the parking lot.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.000
Maybe you got into it out there.

18:08.083 --> 18:10.917
- No.
- You were pretty mad, Seth.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.500
Furious.

18:13.917 --> 18:18.000
But out in the parking lot,
everything changed.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.625
- 'Wait, I gotta see 'em.'
- 'What? Just stay away.'

18:24.709 --> 18:26.709
(Sloane)
'Just to say I'm sorry!'

18:26.792 --> 18:29.542
You want 'em to see you
like this?

18:29.625 --> 18:31.500
Seth, the kids are cold!

18:31.583 --> 18:32.667
Look, one minute, Rose.

18:32.750 --> 18:33.875
Mommy!

18:33.959 --> 18:35.709
Haley, baby. I'm sorry.

18:35.792 --> 18:37.834
Just close the window.
I'm coming.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.625
You know I love them, Seth.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.375
You know how I cried
when they were born.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.125
I cried..

18:49.208 --> 18:51.291
...'cause now I had
even more of you.

19:00.917 --> 19:05.500
Aw, Sloane,
how did this happen to us?

19:05.583 --> 19:06.667
It's my fault.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.458
- Why can't I help you?
- Come on, Seth.

19:09.542 --> 19:12.375
Should I have been harder
on you, easier?

19:12.458 --> 19:16.208
It wouldn't have mattered,
baby.
It wouldn't be different.

19:16.291 --> 19:18.917
That's what we learned the
second time and the third
time.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.875
Why not?

19:22.125 --> 19:25.625
'Cause I can't beat it.

19:25.709 --> 19:29.000
You haven't called
me "baby" in forever.

19:29.083 --> 19:31.166
Go with Rose.

19:37.583 --> 19:38.917
Make a life with her.

19:56.250 --> 19:59.709
She wasn't much at the end

19:59.792 --> 20:02.583
but there were moments

20:02.667 --> 20:04.917
we could still connect.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.834
And in her good years..

20:07.917 --> 20:09.750
(Vera)
'Yeah, I know.'

20:09.834 --> 20:13.208
I knew her before you did.

20:13.291 --> 20:15.083
Immaculata High.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.625
Wasn't she somethin'?

20:17.709 --> 20:19.834
Everyone's All-American.

20:21.542 --> 20:24.458
How could booze kill all that?

20:36.709 --> 20:38.333
- Valens.
- Where you going, Frannie?

20:38.417 --> 20:40.375
I got lab
results
for your boss.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.667
Well, you can give 'em
to me. I'm reliable.

20:44.875 --> 20:45.917
I've been meaning to say

20:46.000 --> 20:49.041
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

20:49.125 --> 20:51.333
- Thanks.
- That's a tough illness.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.583
Can get to be too much.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.667
Well, we don't know
exactly what happened.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.583
Oh, sorry. I heard--

20:56.667 --> 20:59.333
Suicide? No.
No, we don't know that.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.667
Well, I shouldn't speak
out of school, then.

21:02.750 --> 21:05.000
But...thanks.

21:05.083 --> 21:07.458
So...the blood on
your victim's
coat?

21:07.542 --> 21:09.667
- Weird result.
- Like what?

21:09.750 --> 21:11.250
Like out of my jurisdiction.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.417
The predominant
stains are her
blood.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.375
But the other spots are canine.

21:22.458 --> 21:24.083
How's a woman at a bar
get dog blood on her?

21:24.166 --> 21:26.000
Owner of Sansom's
had a Rottweiler.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.417
And the husband's girlfriend

21:27.500 --> 21:29.208
Rose had a Doberman.

21:29.291 --> 21:31.000
So, two dogs to follow up.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.041
Bar owner refused a DNA test.

21:33.125 --> 21:37.083
And the Liquor Board has five
open investigations on him.

21:38.917 --> 21:41.750
So, this Rose
was at the scene earlier?

21:41.834 --> 21:44.917
She was in the car when Seth
and
Sloane went down memory lane.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.583
- Maybe overheard something.
- Could give her motive.

21:47.667 --> 21:51.625
Lil's chatting with her.
Woman to woman.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.375
Nicky, how'd it go with Megan?

21:53.458 --> 21:54.875
Fine.

21:59.083 --> 22:02.166
We're, uh, goin' to
this place tonight.

22:03.250 --> 22:05.333
Hangout from high school.

22:07.083 --> 22:08.125
Shut up.

22:13.291 --> 22:16.417
I thought Sloane's death
was an accident.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.417
Well, that was one theory.

22:19.667 --> 22:20.875
I don't know how
I can help you.

22:20.959 --> 22:22.542
'Well, you were
there that night.'

22:22.625 --> 22:24.250
With your vicious dog.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.208
Tuck wasn't vicious.

22:26.291 --> 22:28.583
You saw the way she
and Seth were talking.

22:28.667 --> 22:32.250
- 'How she touched him.'
- They had history.

22:32.333 --> 22:34.500
Rose, there was
dog blood on her coat

22:34.583 --> 22:36.625
you were angry
and you had a dog.

22:36.709 --> 22:37.792
I wasn't angry.

22:37.875 --> 22:39.083
'You were with
a guy who wanted'

22:39.166 --> 22:40.875
'to be with someone else.'

22:40.959 --> 22:43.709
That's something you sense.

22:44.834 --> 22:45.792
You'd think after Sloane

22:45.875 --> 22:47.583
he'd run to someone like me.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.875
Responsible. Steady.

22:53.333 --> 22:55.917
But Sloane had his heart.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.375
Hurts.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.333
'Let's talk about
the dog blood.'

23:00.417 --> 23:02.375
Do you know how it got there?

23:03.917 --> 23:07.041
Yeah. But it wasn't from Tuck.

23:14.709 --> 23:16.667
(Sloane)
'You're gonna be okay.'

23:18.542 --> 23:21.041
You just need a little help.

23:23.208 --> 23:24.667
(Powell)
'Out of the way, Sloane.'

23:24.750 --> 23:25.625
No, Powell.

23:25.709 --> 23:26.959
One good crack and it's over.

23:27.041 --> 23:29.000
- No big deal.
- Give him another chance!

23:29.083 --> 23:32.125
Just cost me 400 bucks.
Can't fight, worth crap.

23:32.208 --> 23:33.959
I'll take him. I'll fix him.

23:34.041 --> 23:35.959
Oh, yeah,
you'll take great care of him

23:36.041 --> 23:37.583
then leave him at Rodeo Rob's.

23:39.917 --> 23:42.291
- Move!
- No.

23:42.375 --> 23:43.959
- 'I-I'll tell the cops.'
- 'Yeah.'

23:44.041 --> 23:45.166
'You'll tell the cops what?'

23:45.250 --> 23:46.709
About the dogfights!
And the bets.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.500
I-I'll get this place shut down.

23:48.583 --> 23:49.959
Stop running your stupid mouth.

23:50.041 --> 23:51.583
I will!

23:57.417 --> 23:59.917
You want the mutt, take him.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.959
- I'll make him better.
- I don't care!

24:02.041 --> 24:04.625
Just get the hell
off of my property.

24:04.709 --> 24:06.667
- I work here.
- Not anymore.

24:06.750 --> 24:08.542
Get lost, for good.

24:08.625 --> 24:09.834
Or you'll get cracked.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.834
It's okay, baby.
You'll make it.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.375
She looked crazy,
that blood all over her.

24:27.458 --> 24:29.500
I just left.

24:29.583 --> 24:33.208
So you went back,
but never even talked to her?

24:33.291 --> 24:34.208
What could I say?

24:34.291 --> 24:37.250
Make him stop loving you?

24:38.667 --> 24:41.542
That wasn't possible.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.417
Dog wasn't worth
the Alpo I fed him.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.083
Sloane thought so.

24:54.166 --> 24:56.291
They were both
good for nothing.

24:56.375 --> 24:58.166
Losers unite.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.458
Hit ya?

24:59.542 --> 25:01.166
Look, Powell.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.041
You were swinging a
bottle around that night.

25:04.125 --> 25:06.208
Sloane ends up with
trauma to her head.

25:06.291 --> 25:07.417
Get my meaning?

25:07.500 --> 25:11.125
All I did to her
was fire her ass.

25:11.208 --> 25:12.458
That's all?

25:12.542 --> 25:13.458
That's all.

25:13.542 --> 25:15.208
She didn't come back?

25:16.709 --> 25:19.417
Uh, yeah, she came back.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.166
What for?

25:21.250 --> 25:22.750
Get her job back.

25:22.834 --> 25:26.250
- Begged me.
- She persuade you?

25:26.333 --> 25:30.041
- Kind of.
- What's "Kind of", Powell?

25:32.125 --> 25:33.333
Not saying I'm proud of it

25:33.417 --> 25:35.166
I'm just saying it happened.

25:48.583 --> 25:51.709
I told you to beat it.

25:51.792 --> 25:52.959
Ravage is cold.

25:53.041 --> 25:55.333
Your problem now.

26:02.625 --> 26:04.458
Bourbon, please.

26:04.542 --> 26:06.250
Forget it.

26:06.333 --> 26:07.625
I'll work a week for free.

26:07.709 --> 26:10.667
- You don't work here anymore.
- 'Powell.'

26:13.166 --> 26:14.583
I need this job.

26:14.667 --> 26:17.458
There's a hundred watering
holes
in West Philly.

26:17.542 --> 26:20.792
- Pick one.
- I have to work here.

26:24.709 --> 26:26.542
It's a bad life, Sloane.

26:26.625 --> 26:27.834
For the birds.

26:27.917 --> 26:31.250
I'll work for free.
I'll scrub the floors.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.333
- I just need one.
- No.

26:38.834 --> 26:41.000
Powell.

26:41.083 --> 26:44.875
I'll do...anything.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.458
I mean it.

26:55.250 --> 26:57.875
She got on her knees..

26:57.959 --> 26:59.125
...for you?

26:59.208 --> 27:02.166
Not my finest moment.

27:02.250 --> 27:05.083
But she got to keep her job.

27:05.166 --> 27:08.333
Middle of it,
in walks Richie Rich.

27:08.417 --> 27:10.041
Who's that?

27:10.125 --> 27:12.166
College boy
from early in the night.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.583
Wow. Are we talking
about Garrett?

27:15.917 --> 27:19.250
When it's over, I look up,
he's standing there.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.458
Think he was watching
the whole time.

27:21.542 --> 27:24.542
- Why'd he come back?
- Buy drugs.

27:24.625 --> 27:26.750
I sold to him, then left.

27:26.834 --> 27:28.000
And where's Sloane?

27:28.083 --> 27:31.375
Back room. Locking up.

27:31.458 --> 27:33.291
So, last you saw..

27:33.375 --> 27:35.792
...Garrett and her
were alone together?

27:37.917 --> 27:39.375
Huh.

27:43.500 --> 27:46.375
(Vera)
'How long could they
close Anna's Kitchen?'

27:46.458 --> 27:48.417
Guess that's not why
it's happening anymore.

27:52.458 --> 27:54.083
Well, cheers anyway.

27:58.500 --> 28:01.542
The years have been
good to you, Meggie.

28:01.625 --> 28:03.041
Alright.

28:03.125 --> 28:06.417
I guess I
already
told you that.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.542
They've been okay.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.583
What's your husband like?

28:11.667 --> 28:15.000
Nice. Works hard.

28:15.083 --> 28:16.458
Good.

28:18.333 --> 28:21.083
But, um..

28:21.166 --> 28:24.083
...I don't know.

28:24.166 --> 28:26.542
We ran out of
conversation.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.959
We haven't been doing
so hot either..

28:34.041 --> 28:35.542
...me and Julie.

28:35.625 --> 28:37.834
How come?

28:43.375 --> 28:46.000
We wanted a baby.

28:48.458 --> 28:49.417
Uh-huh.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.792
'For a lot of years, but..'

28:51.875 --> 28:53.291
...no go.

28:53.375 --> 28:54.625
You talk to doctors?

28:54.709 --> 28:57.333
Yeah. We tried all the stuff.

28:57.417 --> 28:59.125
Yeah.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.792
'And somewhere
along the line'

29:01.875 --> 29:04.750
it killed off the love.

29:07.041 --> 29:09.667
(Megan)
'I think about you sometimes'

29:09.750 --> 29:11.583
'and that summer.'

29:14.041 --> 29:15.709
Me, too.

29:18.792 --> 29:21.917
What things
would be like now?

29:26.250 --> 29:29.458
We'd have a
19-year-old.
That's what.

29:34.041 --> 29:36.041
I wonder if we would
have made it.

29:40.917 --> 29:42.750
'Aw, Megs.'

29:45.458 --> 29:47.750
It should have been you and me.

29:58.333 --> 29:59.875
So, Garrett likes to watch.

29:59.959 --> 30:02.542
Got your Beach Night
after all...amigo.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.959
- What are you talking about?
- You.

30:05.041 --> 30:07.917
Peeping while
the bartender got serviced.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.500
Pretty homoerotic,
you ask me.

30:09.583 --> 30:10.709
I didn't ask you.

30:10.792 --> 30:13.041
You went back,
Garrett.
Late night.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.458
Found Sloane
all by herself.

30:14.542 --> 30:15.875
A few hours later, she's dead.

30:15.959 --> 30:18.709
I went to buy pot.

30:18.792 --> 30:19.667
That's it.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.417
Yeah, I don't think so, Garrett.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.875
Happy hour, you get
thrown off by this girl.

30:23.959 --> 30:26.458
Slink back to campus,
shake it off.

30:26.542 --> 30:28.208
But around 3 a.m.
the parties are over

30:28.291 --> 30:30.875
and you didn't hook up. So,
where are you gonna get some?

30:30.959 --> 30:32.917
Then you remember
the trash from the bar.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.917
Figure, let me go
buy some weed

30:35.000 --> 30:37.792
bang the skank,
call it a night.

30:37.875 --> 30:38.917
I didn't kill her.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.083
You did something.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.875
Penn Student Health records.

30:42.959 --> 30:44.625
Day after Sloane died
you went in

30:44.709 --> 30:46.750
with an ugly gash on your arm.

30:46.834 --> 30:47.834
Is that against the law?

30:47.917 --> 30:51.250
She fight back?
She bite you?

30:51.333 --> 30:53.834
Hey, listen up, Garrett.
You're the last to see.

30:53.917 --> 30:55.959
A cop saw you handling
this girl, earlier.

30:56.041 --> 30:58.000
Everything's pointing at you.

31:00.166 --> 31:03.208
I went to use the head.

31:03.291 --> 31:05.542
I come out..

31:05.625 --> 31:07.792
...she's yakking on the phone.

31:09.166 --> 31:11.625
(Sloane)
'I did a bad thing.'

31:11.709 --> 31:12.709
Worst I ever did.

31:12.792 --> 31:14.291
And I can't..

31:14.375 --> 31:15.625
...I can't have this anymore.

31:18.709 --> 31:20.959
Yes, please.

31:21.041 --> 31:22.792
Okay. Bye.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.583
- What do you want?
- I'll take what Powell had.

31:26.667 --> 31:29.291
We're closed, okay?

31:29.375 --> 31:30.959
It's a private party?

31:31.041 --> 31:33.417
Someone's coming for me,
so don't try your crap.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.375
What crap is that?

31:35.458 --> 31:36.959
'Whoa, killer.'

31:37.041 --> 31:38.583
That is one ugly dog.

31:38.667 --> 31:40.667
'He's mine.'

31:40.750 --> 31:41.959
His name is Ravage.

31:42.041 --> 31:43.875
That's appropriate.

31:43.959 --> 31:47.375
He got hurt,
but he's gonna get better.

31:47.458 --> 31:48.542
Let's finish what
we started, okay?

31:48.625 --> 31:49.875
Stop it. Stop!

31:49.959 --> 31:52.083
- Not this.
- Get off. I mean it, get
off!

31:56.875 --> 31:59.542
- 'Call him off!'
- Oh, my gosh!

31:59.625 --> 32:00.583
Call him off!

32:00.667 --> 32:03.375
Stop, you..

32:03.458 --> 32:04.875
(Sloane)
'Keep going, Ravage!'

32:04.959 --> 32:06.959
Attack his ass!

32:07.041 --> 32:08.083
Damn it!

32:08.166 --> 32:09.458
'Run away!'

32:09.542 --> 32:12.709
Run away,
you little college punk!

32:15.542 --> 32:17.834
Psycho dog chased me
three blocks.

32:17.917 --> 32:19.041
Chomped your arm pretty good.

32:19.125 --> 32:20.667
Lucky I didn't get
friggin' rabies.

32:20.750 --> 32:23.083
Sloane said someone
was coming for her?

32:23.166 --> 32:24.166
Probably lying.

32:24.250 --> 32:25.667
Unless it was
the person on the phone.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.917
Who was she talking to,
that time of night?

32:30.917 --> 32:34.208
Someone who wasn't scared
of a 3:00 a.m. phone call.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.542
I could've called.

32:44.625 --> 32:47.375
I d...I didn't
mind coming in.

32:47.458 --> 32:49.750
- Can I get you anything?
Water?
- No.

32:49.834 --> 32:53.041
Just...tell me
what's going
on.

32:54.667 --> 32:56.250
Um..

32:58.125 --> 33:02.208
Sloane had fallen
real...low...that night.

33:02.291 --> 33:03.917
Ran into trouble.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.709
What did she do..

33:05.792 --> 33:07.875
...that was so low?

33:07.959 --> 33:10.250
You don't need to know that.

33:15.375 --> 33:18.083
I used to look up to her..

33:18.166 --> 33:20.417
...so much.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.875
Just think of her that way.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.583
Skating, winning.

33:25.667 --> 33:26.750
Yeah.

33:26.834 --> 33:28.417
We should remember
people at their best

33:28.500 --> 33:31.333
not how they ended up.

33:32.166 --> 33:34.417
Yeah.

33:45.750 --> 33:48.000
So, what if we had lunch?

33:50.709 --> 33:53.667
I couldn't do that, Meggie.

33:53.750 --> 33:55.792
Not with you.

34:01.667 --> 34:04.041
I'm just sad so much.

34:08.709 --> 34:11.291
Last night I wasn't.

34:14.083 --> 34:15.834
Me, too.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.583
Detective.

35:15.834 --> 35:18.417
[sighs]
Lilly.

35:18.500 --> 35:22.000
You okay?

35:22.083 --> 35:23.417
I've been
staring
at the little
swirls

35:23.500 --> 35:26.959
in this scotch
for about an
hour.

35:27.041 --> 35:30.333
I've been there.

35:30.417 --> 35:32.166
I haven't had a
drink
in eight years.

35:32.250 --> 35:34.792
Well, don't start now.

35:34.875 --> 35:36.583
But I never forgot
how good it feels

35:36.667 --> 35:38.458
knocking one of these back.

35:39.792 --> 35:42.500
It turns bad real quick.

35:48.208 --> 35:50.041
Thanks for coming so late.

35:50.125 --> 35:51.041
We get into trouble

35:51.125 --> 35:52.917
all times of night.

36:01.959 --> 36:03.750
I was wondering about that.

36:03.834 --> 36:05.166
There was a pull..

36:05.250 --> 36:07.750
...right when we met.

36:07.834 --> 36:09.834
Yeah.

36:11.041 --> 36:13.583
This is a bad place.
Let's go.

36:15.125 --> 36:17.500
- I'm not sure we should.
- I am.

36:17.583 --> 36:19.083
Isn't it
against
the rules?

36:19.166 --> 36:20.542
Don't worry, Lilly.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.917
Oh, so that's
how it works,
huh?

36:25.000 --> 36:26.041
What?

36:26.125 --> 36:28.583
Girl calls you
in the middle of the
night..

36:28.667 --> 36:30.792
...weak, needy.

36:31.583 --> 36:32.917
That's when you score.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.166
That's not what's going on here.

36:34.250 --> 36:35.458
You know, I looked for you..

36:35.542 --> 36:38.083
...tonight at
the meeting in your
area.

36:38.166 --> 36:39.458
Yeah?

36:39.542 --> 36:41.250
You know, they said you
hadn't
been there in years.

36:41.333 --> 36:42.750
I go to a chapter
near where I work.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.291
They said you're not
welcome at any meeting

36:44.375 --> 36:47.875
'cause they don't
trust you with
women.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.875
Well, you're obviously
getting hostile.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.583
Did Sloane get hostile?

36:53.667 --> 36:54.750
Call you out on your act?

36:54.834 --> 36:55.792
Sloane?

36:55.875 --> 36:58.750
Well, she called
you that night.

36:58.834 --> 37:01.458
- No.
- Phone records, Rick.

37:01.542 --> 37:03.667
She asked for help.

37:03.750 --> 37:06.291
And a good sponsor
always comes running.

37:06.375 --> 37:07.417
I tried to help her.

37:07.500 --> 37:08.667
Like you tried to help me.

37:08.750 --> 37:11.375
Yeah, and she was
ungrateful, too.

37:11.458 --> 37:14.166
Good reason to bash
someone in the head.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.792
I don't have to talk to you.

37:16.875 --> 37:19.291
Well, my boss and
partner
are right outside.

37:20.250 --> 37:22.625
You wanna talk to them?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.917
I didn't know she was
gonna lay there all night..

37:43.125 --> 37:44.417
'...in the snow.'

37:44.500 --> 37:46.250
How could you?

37:46.333 --> 37:48.750
I didn't mean
for that to
happen.

37:52.583 --> 37:54.333
(Sloane)
'Ravage!'

37:54.417 --> 37:56.875
Ravage, come back!

37:56.959 --> 37:58.166
'Please.'

37:58.250 --> 37:59.375
Come back, boy!

37:59.458 --> 38:01.917
You're my test.
You're my way back.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.250
Please!

38:03.333 --> 38:05.667
- Please! Please..
- Sloane.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.667
- Rick! I lost my dog!
- We're going home. Come on.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.834
- I've gotta find him.
- It's cold out here.

38:10.917 --> 38:12.000
- Come on.
- He's my test.

38:12.083 --> 38:13.417
And if I can take care of him

38:13.500 --> 38:15.000
and be good for him..

38:15.083 --> 38:16.750
...then I can do it
for Seth and the
babies.

38:16.834 --> 38:20.542
- Okay, okay.
- Rick, I did such a bad
thing.

38:20.625 --> 38:21.959
Booze does that to us.

38:22.041 --> 38:23.917
I don't know how
I'm gonna live with
myself.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.208
Help's right here.

38:25.291 --> 38:27.333
- I'm sleepy.
- Let's get you to bed.

38:27.417 --> 38:29.375
- Come on.
- No, I got to find Ravage.

38:29.458 --> 38:31.542
- For God's sake, it's
freezing!
- He took care of me.

38:31.625 --> 38:33.041
Now I gotta take care of him.

38:33.125 --> 38:34.458
- So get in.
- Ravage!

38:34.542 --> 38:36.000
We'll drive around,
and we'll call for him.

38:36.083 --> 38:38.166
- Ravage! Come back.
- Come on.

38:41.667 --> 38:44.041
Please, come back. Please.

38:50.458 --> 38:53.458
- Ravage!
- 'Oh, God!'

38:59.000 --> 39:01.417
- He needs a vet!
- Just leave it, Sloane.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.917
Leave it?

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
With warm bath and a bed

39:05.083 --> 39:06.750
you're not gonna be
thinking about a dog.

39:06.834 --> 39:10.000
- Oh, God! You're sleazy!
- Excuse me?

39:10.083 --> 39:12.250
I'm so drunk I can't even
see
and you wanna screw me?

39:12.333 --> 39:13.458
I'm trying to help you.

39:13.542 --> 39:14.917
I just whored
myself for a drink.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.083
- Watch your mouth.
- I'm in the gutter.

39:17.166 --> 39:19.709
And you still want a piece?

39:19.792 --> 39:22.250
- You must be desperate.
- It's late and it's
freezing.

39:22.333 --> 39:24.125
And you're starting
to piss me off!

39:24.208 --> 39:26.125
- You're lower than me, Rick.
- I'm lower than you?

39:26.208 --> 39:27.250
That is funny.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.834
Because you are nothing!

39:31.166 --> 39:34.166
And even I won't have you.

39:34.250 --> 39:36.375
[loud thud]
Ah!

39:36.458 --> 39:38.166
Don't you talk to me
like that!

39:38.250 --> 39:40.125
- I gotta go sleep.
- You go to hell!

39:40.208 --> 39:41.959
What do I care?

39:42.041 --> 39:43.667
I'm still gonna help Ravage.

39:43.750 --> 39:45.375
Screw you, Sloane.

39:45.458 --> 39:47.959
Screw you, you sloppy..

39:48.041 --> 39:49.458
...stumbly drunk!

39:49.542 --> 39:53.291
(Sloane)
'Sleep,
and it'll all be better.'

39:53.375 --> 39:55.959
It's all gonna be better.
