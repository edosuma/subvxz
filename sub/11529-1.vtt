01:17.493 --> 01:21.706
[Bridget] Another year,
a brand new diary.

01:23.499 --> 01:26.294
Once again I was summoned,
kicking and screaming,

01:26.460 --> 01:28.462
to my mother's turkey curry buffet,

01:28.629 --> 01:32.717
where I've had some of the most
shaming experiences of my life.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.303
- [Doorbell]
- Hello, darling.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.431
- Lovely to see you.
- [Magic Moments plays]

01:38.598 --> 01:40.725
It was, as usual, crammed full

01:40.892 --> 01:43.895
with some of the most dangerous perverts
in the UK,

01:44.061 --> 01:47.106
disguised as close, personal friends
of my parents.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.108
- Hello, Bridget.
- Hello, Una.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.694
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Love the jumper.

01:51.861 --> 01:55.489
- I prefer what's underneath it.
- Uncle Geoffrey!

01:55.656 --> 01:57.867
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hello.

01:58.784 --> 02:01.787
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Dad. How's it going?

02:01.954 --> 02:03.539
I wish I was dead.

02:03.706 --> 02:09.378
[Bridget] But this year,
there was one crucial difference.

02:13.716 --> 02:17.094
- Nice jumper.
- My mother's taste never falters.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.058
Never.

02:41.619 --> 02:44.205
[Bridget hums along with song]

02:55.758 --> 02:59.762
You always wonder how it's going
to work out at the end of the story.

03:02.306 --> 03:04.141
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,

03:04.308 --> 03:07.395
Mark Darcy and Bridget Jones.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.898
I've found my happy ending at last.

03:11.065 --> 03:14.986
And nothing in the world can spoil it.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.613
Well, almost nothing.

03:17.780 --> 03:20.950
[Man] Bridget Jones,
what the fuck are you doing?

03:21.659 --> 03:26.706
- I, I can't see anywhere soft to land.
- How about on your arse?

03:26.873 --> 03:30.293
Bridget, unless you want to get sacked
at 6,000 feet,

03:30.459 --> 03:33.629
you will be on your way
in exactly three seconds.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.549
Three, two, one... cue Bridget.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.343
Skydiving:

03:39.510 --> 03:43.264
A dangerous bane to the countryside
and emergency services,

03:43.431 --> 03:46.642
or a safe and exhilarating hobby?

03:46.809 --> 03:50.021
Well... let's see, shall we?

03:50.188 --> 03:52.607
Go. Jump.

03:52.773 --> 03:55.484
- For Christ’s sakes, go!
- [Screams]

03:55.651 --> 03:57.820
[Shrill scream]

03:59.113 --> 04:02.116
- She's out. Unit Two, you got her?
- [Man] We see her.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.994
- Bridget, open the chute.
- [Bridget screams]

04:07.121 --> 04:09.207
- Open it.
- [Bridget screams]

04:09.832 --> 04:12.001
Open your fucking parachute!

04:12.168 --> 04:14.837

Pull the thingy or you will die!

[screams]

04:20.426 --> 04:21.469
Oh.

04:21.636 --> 04:26.307
[Bridget] Honestly,
you forget just one teeny, weeny detail

04:26.474 --> 04:28.768
and everyone treats you like an idiot.

[Bridget] Where was I?
Oh, yes... Mark Darcy.

05:10.226 --> 05:14.897

after you walk off into the sunset?

Well, this is Bridget Jones

[Bridget] Who cares about
the odd professional hiccup?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.402
I've been in a functional relationship

06:01.569 --> 06:04.780
with an adult male
for six wonderful weeks,

06:04.947 --> 06:08.618
four fabulous days
and seven precious hours.

06:09.702 --> 06:14.248
Or to put it another way,
71 ecstatic shags.

06:16.334 --> 06:20.213
He's given up being snooty,
and I've given up smoking.

06:21.672 --> 06:24.592
- # Loving you...
- Well, he thinks I have anyway,

06:24.759 --> 06:26.844

Not a fuckwit, alcoholic, workaholic,
pervert or megalomaniac,

06:36.354 --> 06:39.273
but total sex god
and human rights lawyer.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.193
He is a miracle, really.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.107
He's a human rights lawyer, you know.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.192
Yes, we know.

07:24.318 --> 07:28.030
I cannot believe how fantastic
shagging was last night.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.741
Maybe I'll ring him.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.702
No, no...

07:32.869 --> 07:36.956
Obviously it's important to tell one's
boyfriend how nice he looks naked,

07:37.123 --> 07:40.793

Pulitzer Prize winning journalism to do.

I'm fine, thanks.
Everything all right with you?

07:55.057 --> 07:57.143
[Whispering] Fine, though, er...

07:57.768 --> 08:01.814
I've just had a rather graphic
shag flashback.

08:02.398 --> 08:06.819
And you do have
a genuinely gorgeous bottom.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.988
Thank you.

Oh. Right, well...

08:23.961 --> 08:26.464
I'm quite busy
with important stuff too...

08:26.631 --> 08:31.010
Bridget, we're waiting for that tape
about Tom, the happy hamster.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.805
- [Mark] I'll call when I've finished.
- Excellent.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.434
And Richard wants to see you
about that crap skydiving report.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.853
[Whispers] Oh, fuck.

08:42.146 --> 08:46.317
Oh, dear. Is this the end of my career?

08:47.109 --> 08:49.111
No, it can't be.

08:49.278 --> 08:54.158
I will fight this. I am a journalist of
the highest standards and integrity.

[On tape] This is Bridget Jones

09:05.419 --> 09:08.965
Look, I never said I could skydive
and I'm terrified of heights,

09:09.131 --> 09:13.928
- so it was really hard to concentrate.
- Be quiet. They loved it upstairs.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.974
Loved it. And they want us to come up
with another regular spot for you.

09:18.140 --> 09:21.102
[Laughs] Oh, my God. That's...

09:21.686 --> 09:24.355
- I won't let you down, Richard.
- Precisely.

09:24.522 --> 09:28.359
...my friends’ motto was "When in Rome,
do as many Romans as you can."

09:28.526 --> 09:33.447
But if your tastes are marginally
more highbrow, I also have tips.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.534
Forget the Forum,
definitely forget the Coliseum,

09:36.701 --> 09:39.245
no fun now they can't
slaughter Christians.

09:39.412 --> 09:44.250
Forget the Sistine Chapel, first example
of a poof interior designer gone mad...

09:44.417 --> 09:48.921
What is Daniel Cleaver

10:11.944 --> 10:15.072
Oh. Can’t.
I have to go out with my boyfriend.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.543
Oh. I was just talking about you.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.379
I'm running late.
Do you want me to cancel?

10:30.546 --> 10:33.466
- Oh. No, that's fine.
- Are you sure?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.843
Be as late as you like.

10:37.512 --> 10:41.057
Chuck him, while you're not pregnant
with his unwanted child.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.059
I only said he was working late.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.604
In one hour, he'll be coming
in his secretary's mouth

10:46.771 --> 10:49.565
while he rings to say
what he wants for starters.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.860
[Bridget] Friends spend years
finding you a boyfriend,

10:53.027 --> 10:55.029
then instantly tell you to dump him.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.699
Even if he isn't shagging her already,
he's thinking about it.

10:58.866 --> 11:03.079
A man dating a woman with large breasts
will bed one with small breasts.

11:03.246 --> 11:06.207
Rubbish. Mark's above all that nonsense.

11:06.374 --> 11:09.252
Jellyfisher alert. Jellyfisher alert.

11:11.379 --> 11:15.383
[Bridget] Janey Osborne.
Talking to her is like swimming in a sea

11:15.550 --> 11:18.803
and being stung repeatedly
by an enormous jellyfish.

11:18.970 --> 11:23.683
Bridget. How's it going
with that divine man of yours?

11:23.850 --> 11:26.769
You must be so pleased
to have a boyfriend at last.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.896
First jellyfish of the evening.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.399
Is he taking you
to the Law Council Dinner?

11:31.566 --> 11:33.901
Oh. Well, I'm sure he's just forgotten.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.529
Better start slimming into that dress.

11:36.696 --> 11:41.033
He's given you the night off
to cheer up your single friends. Sweet.

11:41.200 --> 11:46.080
Actually, he's got a big case on, trying
to get everyone in Mexico out of prison.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.041
We're meeting for a very late
romantic dinner.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.627
Really? That's so odd,

11:51.794 --> 11:55.673
'cause I saw him an hour ago going
into his house with Rebecca Gillies.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.010
She's only 22.
She's got legs up to here.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.512
And Daddy owns half of Australia.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.808
See ya, babes.

12:09.145 --> 12:13.399
Who is Rebecca Gillies? What's she doing
going into my boyfriend's house?

12:13.566 --> 12:16.861
Where he never asks me.
And with legs up to here?

12:17.028 --> 12:20.823
- My legs only come up to there.
- [Jude] You have fine legs.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.992
Climber’s legs.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.870
I say go over there and ask him,
straight out,

12:26.037 --> 12:29.040
are you or are you not
sleeping with Rebecca Gillies?

12:29.207 --> 12:33.169
- [Shazzer] If he says...
- I won't dignify that with an answer...

12:33.336 --> 12:35.338
Then you know he's shagging her.

12:36.214 --> 12:39.842
# All that I have
is all that you've given...

12:40.009 --> 12:44.180

trust. Mark would never betray me.

Everything will be lovely
and we'll have sex in the kitchen.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.979

- [Woman inside] I'm coming.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.649

Now you're really angry with me.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.330
- No, I'm not.
- It's OK, you can say if you are.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.917
- It's not the end of the world.
- I'll get you a glass of wine.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.796
The thing is I ran into Janey Osborne,

15:21.963 --> 15:27.093
who said she'd just seen you
with this girl, with really long legs,

15:27.260 --> 15:31.347
and Shazzer and Jude said
I should get over here straightaway.

15:31.514 --> 15:35.351
Following the orders of the dating
war command, you executed a raid.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.312
- You are angry.
- I'm not, just disappointed.

15:38.479 --> 15:42.149
Disappointed?
Oh, God, that's worse than angry.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.822
I'm just disappointed
I can't take you home this instant.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.411
Oh. [chuckles]
What about all those lawyers?

15:53.578 --> 15:57.748
Oh, plenty of time to butter them up
at the Law Council Dinner next Friday.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.218
Don't want to go, do you?

16:09.385 --> 16:11.137
I'd love to.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.729
Oh, stupid Bridget, stupid friends.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.565
Wonderful, loyal Mark Darcy...

16:23.983 --> 16:26.694
...who loves me just the way I am.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.321
[Birdsong]

16:49.550 --> 16:51.552
[Bridget pants]

16:53.804 --> 16:57.016
- [Mark] What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.602
Why are you dancing around in that tent?

16:59.769 --> 17:05.399
[Sighs] Because I don't want you to see
any of my wobbly bits.

17:05.566 --> 17:09.529
That's pointless, because I have
a very high regard for your wobbly bits

17:09.695 --> 17:11.697
in all circumstances.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.866
- Really?
- Absolutely.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.869
I think it's high time
we had another look.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.997
# Yeah

17:21.415 --> 17:23.501
# Are you digging on me?

17:23.668 --> 17:25.461
# Yeah

17:26.462 --> 17:28.881
# I'm digging on you, now, baby

17:29.048 --> 17:30.299
# Yeah

17:31.634 --> 17:33.886
# Do you want a little bit of my love?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.096
# Yeah...

17:35.263 --> 17:39.058
[Bridget]
He really is very, very, very nice.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.478
# All the time I knew

17:42.645 --> 17:44.272
# That you loved me

17:45.106 --> 17:46.899
# And you promised me...

17:47.066 --> 17:49.151
I miss you too.

17:50.528 --> 17:54.365
# That you would be my only man

17:54.532 --> 17:55.741
# Yeah

17:57.285 --> 17:59.287
# Are you digging on me?

18:00.246 --> 18:03.332
[Bridget] I've never been happier
in my entire life.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.711
However, must not obsess or fantasize.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.339
Bridget Darcy.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.550
Mrs. Darcy.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.844
Mr. and Mrs. Darcy.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.430
Lord and Lady Darcy.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.227
Wonder what Mark Darcy
would be like as a father.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.771
To his children, I mean, not to me.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.858
That would be a weird,
Oedipus-like thought.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.069
At last, life is on track.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.781
Bridget Jones: Fiancée, wife...

18:35.948 --> 18:37.366
mother.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.535
Bugger.

18:39.702 --> 18:43.331
[Man] Ever fancied doing it in the dark
with a total stranger?

18:48.002 --> 18:50.588
All right, perhaps not a total stranger.

18:52.173 --> 18:56.260
Back off, Cleaver, or I'll report you
to a sexual harassment tribunal.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.887
I'm a serious journalist.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.515
Is that your most serious skirt, Jones?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.225
Oh...

19:02.391 --> 19:04.268
Do you like it?

19:04.435 --> 19:06.771
I thought you hated television.

19:06.938 --> 19:10.233
I hate watching television.
Being on it is... Hello there.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.401
...entirely different.

19:12.568 --> 19:16.572
Daniel, thought the Madrid piece
was outstanding, really original.

19:16.739 --> 19:20.701
Cheers, Jeremy. Appreciate that.
We had to work really hard on that one.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.996
Tosser. Talking of which,
how is Mark Darcy?

19:25.414 --> 19:27.625
- You still...?
- Yes, I am.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.211
And I intend to be for a very long time.

19:30.378 --> 19:34.090
Good. You know what a fan I am
of any woman married to Mark Darcy.

19:34.257 --> 19:37.510
- That's not funny.
- Seriously, though, Jones,

19:37.677 --> 19:40.471
speaking purely unselfishly,
I worry about you.

19:40.930 --> 19:45.101
You do know that it's a fact that
most lawyer's wives die of boredom?

19:45.726 --> 19:49.313
And what about you?
Still shagging anything that moves?

19:49.856 --> 19:52.733
As a matter of fact, no.
No shagging whatsoever.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.111
I'm in shag therapy.

19:55.278 --> 19:59.448
It turns out I have a problem. I go
to meetings, talk about my feelings.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.659
Hug people who smell.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.537
- I don't believe you.
- I'm trying...

20:04.954 --> 20:06.956
...to be a better man, Bridge,

20:07.123 --> 20:10.042
so that the next time
a better woman comes along,

20:10.209 --> 20:13.254
I won't make a pig's ear of it.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.340
Daniel. Meeting?

20:16.966 --> 20:19.051
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.847
Very good hair, Jones.

20:25.183 --> 20:28.811
By the way, um, you're not free
for dinner tonight, are you?

20:28.978 --> 20:32.690
No, I'm not.
I'm going to the Law Council Dinner.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.318
It's a very important evening.

20:35.484 --> 20:38.237
[# Kylie Minogue:
Can't Get You Out Of My Head]

20:39.363 --> 20:41.199
I can't wear that.

20:41.365 --> 20:45.578
Bridge, do you want to get married and
have babies before you become barren?

20:45.745 --> 20:46.871
Trust me...

20:47.038 --> 20:50.958
[Bridget] Magda: My only grown-up
friend. Married to Mark's partner.

20:51.125 --> 20:55.004
She actually got engaged
on the night of the Law Council Dinner.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.173
Try it with the dress.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.716
Oh, my God!

20:58.883 --> 21:02.803
Remember, we are trying to reduce
your body size by 15 per cent.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.307
You hold the front, I'll hold the back.
One, two, three...

21:06.807 --> 21:08.851
[Bridget whimpers]

21:09.018 --> 21:11.854
- [Bridget shrieks]
- What's going on in there?

21:12.855 --> 21:14.482
Not too bad, actually.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.194
Tra-la!

21:18.778 --> 21:20.404
Fantastic.

21:20.571 --> 21:23.825
Right, let us begin.

21:23.991 --> 21:28.162
I am going to make you into a princess.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.455
Goody.

21:29.622 --> 21:33.334
[Bridget] Nothing like being
in the hands of a total genius.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.878
[Whooshing]

21:36.045 --> 21:37.880
Wow.

21:40.842 --> 21:43.803
- [Jude on phone] Whatever you do...
- Bugger it.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.013
...don't iron your hair.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.016
[Jude] It's a lot worse than I thought.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.269
We could flatten it with Brylcream.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.813
What about a wig? Lawyers love wigs.

21:53.980 --> 21:58.317
- I preferred you in the gold.
- No, whatever you do, not the gold.

21:58.484 --> 22:03.281
Great. I'm late with mad hair and can
barely breathe in scary knickers.

22:03.447 --> 22:07.034
# La la la
La la la la la...

22:07.201 --> 22:09.745
[Bridget] Oh, God. I'm very worried.

22:09.912 --> 22:15.001
What if someone says "Bridget Jones,
get out of here, you are ridiculous"?

22:15.960 --> 22:17.795
Stop it.

22:17.962 --> 22:22.341
The most important thing, of course,
is to look absolutely wonderful

22:22.508 --> 22:25.178
and make a magnificent entrance.

22:25.595 --> 22:28.598
# I just can't get you out of my head...

22:28.764 --> 22:30.975
[chatter]

22:35.062 --> 22:37.064
[Violins]

22:37.565 --> 22:40.610
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

22:41.110 --> 22:45.114
- Hello.
- I think you should go to the ladies.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.909
But I went before I left home.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.578
Trust me on this one.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.997
[Gasps] Oh.

22:53.164 --> 22:55.166
Not good.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.212
[Thinks]
All right, tiny make-up mistake,

23:00.755 --> 23:04.300
but I always have wit and conversation
to fall back on.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.436
Thank you.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.482
- Bridget.
- Hello.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.860
Derek, Horatio, Camilla.

23:23.027 --> 23:26.239
- Horatio?
- Yes, Horatio.

23:26.405 --> 23:30.201
Horatio was just saying
he's totally against charitable giving.

23:30.368 --> 23:32.370
[Laughs]

23:32.995 --> 23:36.040
- What?
- Well, obviously you don't mean it.

23:36.207 --> 23:40.753
Absolutely. Do you think it's helpful
to give a beggar fifty pence?

23:40.920 --> 23:43.965
- Maybe he's just hungry.
- Don't be so naive.

23:44.131 --> 23:48.010
The people you see outside the tube
every day are there by choice.

23:48.177 --> 23:51.180
- End of story.
- Oh, no, it's not.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.975
Some people
have terrible personal problems,

23:54.141 --> 23:59.063
and other people might have lost their
family in some tragic ferry disaster.

23:59.230 --> 24:02.900
And some people are just plain hopeless.

24:03.067 --> 24:07.947
Honestly, this is the sort of rubbish
you'd expect from fat, balding

24:08.114 --> 24:14.162
Tory, Home Counties,
upper-middle-class twits.

24:14.328 --> 24:15.454
[Music stops]

24:16.706 --> 24:19.584
- [Chatter resumes]
- [Laughs uneasily]

24:21.878 --> 24:24.088
[Violins, chatter]

24:26.007 --> 24:28.718
[Man] Yeah, very good.
Tested my resolve.

24:33.431 --> 24:35.057
How did I do?

24:35.224 --> 24:38.060
You seem to have made
quite an impression.

24:38.769 --> 24:41.105
I've put you next to Giles Benwick.

24:41.272 --> 24:44.692
- Oh, I'm not sitting next to you?
- No. He's terribly nice,

24:44.859 --> 24:48.487
but his wife's just run off
with one of the partners.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.491
He probably won't mention it,
but you should know.

24:51.657 --> 24:54.535
I always knew she was out of my league.

24:54.702 --> 25:00.833
You see, there's the high-fliers,
like Annabel and Mark Darcy

25:01.000 --> 25:05.755
and there's the gorgeous girls,
like Rebecca there

25:05.922 --> 25:08.382
and there's the rest of us.

25:10.593 --> 25:13.262
Like you and me, you mean?

25:13.429 --> 25:15.473
Absolutely.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.809
I mean, look at the state of us.

25:19.685 --> 25:24.398
You and me stumbled into the VIP room
by mistake

25:24.565 --> 25:28.152
and it's only a matter of moments
before they show us the door.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.616
[Pounding]

25:34.158 --> 25:39.497
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
let the quiz begin.

25:40.331 --> 25:43.751
[Laughs] Oh, goody. I love quizzes.

25:44.460 --> 25:48.089
All those years of playing
Trivial Pursuits are about to pay off.

25:49.507 --> 25:53.761
Now I want to see your hands
poised over those bells. Ready?

25:53.928 --> 25:57.640
Here we go. What are something
called "customary freeholds"?

25:57.807 --> 26:01.018
- [Bell]
- [Man] Superior copyhold.

26:01.185 --> 26:02.436
[Speaker] Yes.

26:02.603 --> 26:05.356
What is the correct grace
used in the Inner Temple

26:05.523 --> 26:08.985
for the second mooting night
of Michaelmas term?

26:09.151 --> 26:13.322
- [Bell]
- [Man] Amas bibendo... fructis.

26:13.489 --> 26:16.742
Jolly good.
What is an overreaching conveyance?

26:16.909 --> 26:20.121
What is rack-rent?
When was breach of promise abolished?

26:20.288 --> 26:22.331
Define "damnum sentit dominus".

26:22.498 --> 26:27.670
Translate "reddendo singula singulis"
into Ancient Greek.

26:27.837 --> 26:30.047
I believe this is the answer.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.632
[Bell]

26:31.799 --> 26:35.595
Hippodamoi credemnon louestai.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.890
- [Speaker] Absolutely correct.
- [Applause]

26:42.852 --> 26:46.606
[Speaker] Now, for our final
and deciding round,

26:46.772 --> 26:50.359
the category is contemporary culture.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.028
[Murmuring]

26:52.195 --> 26:55.615
Who did the design
for Princess Diana's wedding dress?

26:56.657 --> 26:59.160
- [Bell]
- The Emmanuels.

26:59.327 --> 27:01.746
- Correct.
- Excellent, Bridget.

27:01.913 --> 27:04.957
Name the character in Footballers' Wives

27:05.124 --> 27:10.880
who, in one memorable episode,
set fire to her own breasts.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.423
- [Bell]
- Chardonnay.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.592
- [Speaker] Correct.
- [Applause]

27:16.594 --> 27:19.931
At this point,
there are only two tables in contention

27:20.097 --> 27:22.558
and only one question left.

27:24.894 --> 27:28.105
What was the name of Madonna's
first UK single?

27:28.272 --> 27:30.691
- [Bell]
- [Bridget quietly] Lucky Star.

27:30.858 --> 27:34.070
- [Speaker] Sorry, I didn't quite hear.
- Are you sure?

27:34.237 --> 27:37.323
- Wasn't it Holiday?
- No, everyone thinks it is,

27:37.490 --> 27:38.699
but it's not.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.869
My entire life has been leading up
to this very moment.

27:42.036 --> 27:46.207
Take that knife, slice off my head
and boil it if I'm wrong.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.002
The correct answer is Lucky Star.

27:52.213 --> 27:54.549
- No.
- [Groans of disappointment]

27:54.715 --> 27:57.510
- The correct answer is...
- Is it Holiday?

27:57.677 --> 28:00.680
- [Speaker] Holiday, indeed, yes.
- [Applause]

28:03.015 --> 28:07.728
[Speaker] The winners of
the 42nd Annual Law Council Quiz are...

28:07.895 --> 28:10.064
the Legal Eagles.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.233
[Cheering]

28:15.945 --> 28:18.948
- Lovely to see you, Bridget.
- Oh, thanks, Rebecca.

28:19.115 --> 28:21.117
Good night.

28:37.258 --> 28:38.718
[Horn]

28:38.885 --> 28:41.512
[Bridget]
Why didn't you speak to me all night?

28:41.679 --> 28:44.015
[Mark]
That's the point of those dinners.

28:44.182 --> 28:47.852
But you talked to Rebecca.
And you talked to Horatio.

28:50.146 --> 28:52.231
I'll never fit in with your friends.

28:52.398 --> 28:56.611
Not if you go on calling everyone
"balding, upper-middle-class twits".

28:56.777 --> 28:59.989
Well, they were balding,
upper-middle-class twits.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.325
Except for the ones who had hair.

29:03.075 --> 29:06.787
I suppose you agree with them
that poor people deserve to be poor?

29:06.954 --> 29:08.956
Don't be ridiculous.

29:09.123 --> 29:12.793
- So now I'm ridiculous?
- Yes, tonight you were a little.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.421
Well, tonight you were an arrogant arse.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.968
I think I may have
made a mistake inviting you

29:21.135 --> 29:23.679
and your folding underpants
into my life.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.601
Good night.

29:32.647 --> 29:34.774
If you had asked me tonight,

29:35.399 --> 29:37.985
I'd have said no, anyway.

29:40.488 --> 29:42.240
Asked you what?

29:42.406 --> 29:45.034
- Bridget?
- [Sirens nearby]

29:45.201 --> 29:47.203
Asked you what?

29:58.506 --> 30:00.883
[Bridget] Oh, God, I've done it.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.177
I've gone and done it.

30:03.344 --> 30:07.431
One minute, you're closer to someone
than anyone in the whole world,

30:07.598 --> 30:10.685
next minute,
you're never going to see them again.

30:21.779 --> 30:23.573
[Beeps]

30:25.867 --> 30:27.451
[Rings]

30:29.453 --> 30:33.416
[Mark] If you have a message for
Mark Darcy, please speak after the tone.

30:33.583 --> 30:34.709
[Beep]

30:34.876 --> 30:39.046
Hello, it's me.
I'm really, really sorry...

30:39.213 --> 30:40.798
[buzzer]

30:40.965 --> 30:43.134
Sorry, it's the door.

30:43.301 --> 30:46.929
Don't go away, I have something
really, really important to say.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.064
[Buzzer]

30:57.940 --> 31:00.484
- Yes, who is it?
- [Mark] It's me.

31:00.651 --> 31:03.404
- Mark.
- Oh, right.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.781
Er, just a moment.

31:06.866 --> 31:08.618
I'm on the phone.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.786
[Alarm]

31:12.121 --> 31:14.332
[Laughs] You're outside.

31:15.416 --> 31:17.460
Look, er...

31:18.211 --> 31:20.213
I'll ring you later.

31:21.672 --> 31:25.092
Unless you've come to chuck me
once and for all.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.553
In which case,

31:27.720 --> 31:31.933
bye and thank you,
and... sorry.

31:32.099 --> 31:33.559
[Buzzer]

31:33.726 --> 31:35.853
Oh, God, please don't chuck me.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.731
If you have chucked me,
please change your mind,

31:38.898 --> 31:40.942
I'll behave much better in future.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.611
- [Buzzer]
- On the other hand, if you haven't,

31:43.778 --> 31:47.323
please behave better
next time we go out. Stuck-up snob.

31:48.032 --> 31:49.075
[Beep]

31:54.747 --> 31:56.290
What do you want?

31:56.457 --> 31:59.418
I'd like to come up.
You are, after all, my girlfriend.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.922
Even though I shouted at you
and called you an arrogant arse?

32:03.089 --> 32:06.384
Unfortunately, yes.
You see, the problematic thing is...

32:07.510 --> 32:09.512
I love you.

32:11.556 --> 32:12.974
W- what?

32:23.317 --> 32:26.904
- I said I love you.
- I'm sorry, I missed that again.

32:27.071 --> 32:29.031
I said I love you, for God's sake!

32:29.198 --> 32:31.117
[All jeer]

32:34.370 --> 32:37.123
All right, no need to shout.

32:37.290 --> 32:39.333
I'll come down and let you in.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.592
[All cheer]

32:50.803 --> 32:53.389
You might be needing this in the future.

33:01.606 --> 33:03.691
He said he loves me.

33:03.858 --> 33:07.862
- [Tom] He said he loves you?
- He said he loves me.

33:08.029 --> 33:11.949
- Right, where is he now?
- [Whispers] He's in the bedroom.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.161
Go back in there, Bridge,

33:15.328 --> 33:19.540
and whatever you do,
act completely nonchalant.

33:24.420 --> 33:27.006
Bridget, you're staring at me again.

33:27.715 --> 33:29.300
Sorry.

33:30.968 --> 33:34.305
Listen, I know this evening
didn't go exactly as planned,

33:36.349 --> 33:40.144
but there was a very important question
I wanted to ask you tonight.

33:42.146 --> 33:44.649
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

33:45.399 --> 33:47.401
[Takes deep breath]

33:47.568 --> 33:50.947
I've actually been meaning
to ask this for quite some time.

33:51.113 --> 33:54.992
I've just never really found
the right way to put it.

33:59.539 --> 34:01.541
Darling Bridget...

34:04.168 --> 34:05.878
...would you...

34:07.129 --> 34:09.715
...like to go on a skiing mini-break?

34:14.220 --> 34:15.721
Yes!

34:16.305 --> 34:21.269
# What the world...

34:21.435 --> 34:23.855
[Bridget] This is not just a mini-break.

34:25.064 --> 34:28.317
This is a holiday in heaven.

34:30.611 --> 34:34.740
Told a tiny lie about being
an extremely experienced skier.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.494
But, honestly, how hard can it be?

34:39.370 --> 34:41.581
- Ah.
- Shall we?

34:48.212 --> 34:50.923
[Bridget]
I know I'm going to like skiing a lot.

34:51.090 --> 34:53.926
Very romantic, very relaxing.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.139
- Bar going up.
- No. What? Why?

35:01.058 --> 35:03.060
[Bridget whimpers]

35:03.603 --> 35:05.229
Um...

35:05.897 --> 35:07.356
Er...

35:07.523 --> 35:09.525
Oh. Oh, God.

35:09.692 --> 35:11.444
[Whimpers]

35:12.570 --> 35:14.363
Oh, God. Oh.

35:15.656 --> 35:17.450
[Groans]

35:19.452 --> 35:21.162
Ah.

35:30.004 --> 35:31.881
[Screams]

35:36.844 --> 35:38.638
Bridget.

35:38.804 --> 35:42.225
Rebecca. What are you doing here?

35:42.391 --> 35:45.770
- Didn't Mark tell you we were coming?
- No, he didn't.

35:45.937 --> 35:48.105
It was me who recommended the place.

35:48.272 --> 35:51.025
- I've been coming since I was 11.
- Really?

35:51.192 --> 35:52.777
[Thinks] Three whole years.

35:52.944 --> 35:55.154
Come on, up you get.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.073
Come on.

35:58.032 --> 36:00.368
- There you go.
- Are you all right?

36:01.577 --> 36:03.371
Yes, fine, thanks.

36:03.538 --> 36:05.873
- You sure?
- Why is Rebecca here?

36:06.040 --> 36:09.293
Oh, God. Well, I mentioned
that we were coming

36:09.460 --> 36:13.506
and she said why didn't they come too,
and I couldn't say no, could I?

36:13.673 --> 36:16.133
Come on, you two, let's crack on,
shall we?

36:17.009 --> 36:20.346
Actually, I might just sit this one out.
You head on.

36:20.513 --> 36:22.932
- See you down there.
- You sure?

36:23.099 --> 36:25.351
Absolutely. I'll be fine in a minute.

36:25.518 --> 36:28.020
Right, I'll see you at base camp, then.

36:30.398 --> 36:34.735
[Thinks] Bastard.
I can't believe he's left me.

36:38.531 --> 36:39.740
Ooh.

36:47.790 --> 36:49.333
Oooh.

37:00.052 --> 37:04.390
[Thinks] So, romantic getaway
has turned into lawyer's reunion.

37:04.557 --> 37:06.058
Oooh.

37:06.225 --> 37:09.312
I can't believe
we're already into group holidays

37:09.478 --> 37:12.815
after only eight weeks
of total, undisturbed sex.

37:13.482 --> 37:15.485
Wait a minute...

37:15.651 --> 37:18.070
No. Eight weeks?

37:18.237 --> 37:20.656
It couldn't be, could it?

37:20.823 --> 37:22.950
Totally undisturbed...

37:23.117 --> 37:26.412
Oh, God. I'm pregnant.

37:26.996 --> 37:29.081
[Whines]

37:29.248 --> 37:30.958
[Screams]

37:31.125 --> 37:33.169
And going to die!

37:34.212 --> 37:36.214
[cheering]

37:39.717 --> 37:41.260
[Screams]

37:47.517 --> 37:50.645
[Screams] Oh, my God!

37:51.187 --> 37:52.772
I can't see!

37:52.939 --> 37:55.107
[Screams] Big bump!

37:55.274 --> 37:57.401
Get out of the way!

37:57.568 --> 37:59.570
[Screams]

38:00.488 --> 38:03.616
Who's this? An eccentric
but exhilarating performance

38:03.783 --> 38:04.951
from a total unknown,

38:05.117 --> 38:08.454
who's now solidly in position
for the bronze.

38:16.879 --> 38:18.881
- [Screams]
- [Bell clangs]

38:21.968 --> 38:23.761
[Whines]

38:32.812 --> 38:36.232
I would like a pregnancy test, please.

38:36.732 --> 38:39.026
A pregnancy test.

38:39.402 --> 38:43.030
Ich bien, er, possibly...

38:43.197 --> 38:44.991
mit baby.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.035
Er...

38:48.202 --> 38:52.498
Kinder! I am on back...

38:52.665 --> 38:54.876
and he, er...

38:55.042 --> 38:58.880
maken ze lieben.
Er, with me.

39:00.756 --> 39:02.175
[German] She's pregnant!

39:04.177 --> 39:06.429
Oh, no! No, no, not pregnant.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.265
[German] She's bloated.

39:09.432 --> 39:11.309
- Condom?
- Nein. Nein, nein.

39:11.475 --> 39:14.437
Maybe like this, but maybe like this.

39:15.563 --> 39:18.274
[German]
I think her problem is psychological.

39:18.441 --> 39:21.027
[German] There is nothing
a pill can do to help her.

39:21.194 --> 39:23.988
I'm a girl and I met a boy.

39:24.155 --> 39:27.450
Fraulein, and I met frau... boy.

39:28.034 --> 39:32.455
And possibly now mit baby, uh-huh?

39:38.044 --> 39:40.463
Right, moment of truth awaits.

39:41.631 --> 39:43.633
What if I am pregnant?

39:44.467 --> 39:46.886
I must try not to get hopes up too high.

39:47.053 --> 39:50.139
Boyfriend and baby seems just too lucky.

39:50.306 --> 39:53.559
Bridget? I have been looking
everywhere for you.

39:53.726 --> 39:57.813
I thought you'd broken a leg
or something... Oh, God.

40:03.110 --> 40:05.863
- You're not...?
- I might be.

40:07.907 --> 40:11.577
- What if I were?
- Well, I suppose I'd...

40:12.662 --> 40:17.458
To be quite frank,
it'd be bloody fantastic.

40:17.625 --> 40:20.419
I mean, if a little ahead of schedule.

40:20.586 --> 40:24.507
- Are you really pregnant?
- Well, give it three minutes.

40:35.393 --> 40:39.897
- What do you fancy? Boy or a girl?
- I dunno, it doesn't matter.

40:40.940 --> 40:44.193
Although, I suppose I've always had
the fantasy of a son.

40:45.945 --> 40:49.365
- Another Mark Darcy.
- Or maybe something like Huck.

40:49.532 --> 40:53.369
Or River. Or some fabulous
Hebrew name like Noah.

40:53.536 --> 40:56.956
Anyway, I could teach him
to play cricket and rugby

40:57.123 --> 40:59.417
and visit him at Eton
on St Andrew's Day.

40:59.584 --> 41:00.626
Eton?

41:00.793 --> 41:04.922
Yes. The Darcy men have been going
to Eton for five generations.

41:06.090 --> 41:08.801
Well, my son's not going to be
sent away from home.

41:08.968 --> 41:13.222
Especially to some fascist institution
where they stick a poker up your arse

41:13.389 --> 41:15.892
that you're never allowed
to remove again.

41:16.893 --> 41:18.895
I see.

41:19.729 --> 41:21.898
- I didn't mean you.
- No, of course not.

41:22.064 --> 41:25.234
So what's the alternative?
Sleeping in his parents' bed,

41:25.401 --> 41:27.445
breastfeeding until he's a teenager

41:27.612 --> 41:32.158
and some progressive school, where the
day is spent singing Yellow Submarine?

41:32.325 --> 41:33.993
Oh, you're absolutely right.

41:34.160 --> 41:38.456
It's madness to allow a child to enjoy
his education or live with his parents.

41:38.623 --> 41:42.585
What is madness is to have a child
if his parents can't have a discussion

41:42.752 --> 41:44.712
without one shouting at the other.

41:44.879 --> 41:46.088
It's negative.

41:46.255 --> 41:48.716
- That's too bad.
- Yes, very sad.

42:23.751 --> 42:27.380
Perhaps we should go out for lunch
tomorrow. Get out of the grump.

42:30.341 --> 42:33.970
That's a good idea in theory,
but you made a family arrangement.

42:34.846 --> 42:37.056
Oh, God.

42:37.223 --> 42:38.808
[Doorbell]

42:38.975 --> 42:40.184
Darlings!

42:40.351 --> 42:43.312
I've had the fabulous idea
of inviting your parents.

42:43.479 --> 42:46.566
[Bridget] Another one
of Mother's culinary triumphs.

42:46.732 --> 42:50.444
- Everything in miniature.
- Mini treacle tart, Admiral Darcy?

42:50.611 --> 42:54.657
No, no, thank you. The mini spotted dick
rather finished me off.

42:54.824 --> 42:56.200
[Polite laughter]

42:58.077 --> 43:01.998
So, Mark, Bridget, when are you
two lovebirds going to name the day?

43:02.665 --> 43:06.002
Bridget, you must want to hear
those ding-dong bells.

43:12.758 --> 43:16.846
Well, we're certainly not thinking
about that yet. Are we, Bridget?

43:17.597 --> 43:19.640
No. God, no.

43:19.807 --> 43:21.684
Of course not.

43:21.851 --> 43:24.312
[Mr. Jones] Good.
Well, that's that sorted.

43:24.478 --> 43:27.106
So, Admiral, out on the high seas.
How was it?

43:42.622 --> 43:45.666
- Did you mean that thing you said?
- What thing?

43:45.833 --> 43:49.378
- You know what thing.
- No, I don't know what thing.

43:50.296 --> 43:52.298
The thing thing.

43:53.132 --> 43:56.135
Now, let's see, there are any number
of things, um...

43:56.302 --> 43:58.721
in an afternoon full
of all sorts of things,

43:58.888 --> 44:00.765
so I, um...

44:00.932 --> 44:05.478
The thing where you said
you're not, um...

44:08.356 --> 44:13.611
That you're not,
not even thinking about, um...

44:30.127 --> 44:32.588
What's the matter?

44:33.297 --> 44:35.424
Let's get a drink.

44:43.057 --> 44:46.727
I'm going to go to the loo,
then I'm going to come back.

44:46.894 --> 44:49.272
And then we're going to be civilized.

44:53.985 --> 44:55.361
[Telephone]

44:57.822 --> 45:01.033
If you have a message for Mark Darcy,
speak after the tone.

45:01.200 --> 45:02.243
[Beep]

45:02.410 --> 45:04.620
Mark, it's Rebecca. Are you there?

45:06.205 --> 45:09.375
Obviously not.
Probably still out with Bridget.

45:10.376 --> 45:13.838
Um... Anyway, I hope lunch
with the parents went well.

45:14.005 --> 45:17.175
I'm sure you were dutiful
and very polite, as usual.

45:17.341 --> 45:22.471
Er... Whatever. Anyway, look, maybe
give me a ring when you get back.

45:22.638 --> 45:25.308
I thought I might pop round
for a nightcap.

45:26.267 --> 45:29.770
But I suppose that's a silly idea.
Bridget's probably there.

45:30.313 --> 45:32.565
- Sleep tight.
- [Beep]

45:36.694 --> 45:38.988
Oh, Christ, what now?

45:39.155 --> 45:43.117
Are you or are you not having an affair
with Rebecca Gillies?

45:43.826 --> 45:46.746
I won't dignify that question
with an answer.

45:46.913 --> 45:48.706
Right.

45:49.665 --> 45:51.501
All I did was go to the loo.

45:52.668 --> 45:54.545
Bridget!

45:56.964 --> 45:58.674
Bridget.

45:59.800 --> 46:02.220
That's not your coat.

46:03.971 --> 46:06.182
Oh, right.

46:13.940 --> 46:15.942
Oh, Bridget, what are you doing?

46:16.692 --> 46:21.405
I read you should never date someone if
you can think of three reasons not to.

46:21.572 --> 46:23.366
- Can you think of three?
- Yes.

46:23.533 --> 46:27.411
- Which are?
- Well, first off, I embarrass you.

46:27.578 --> 46:30.873
I can't ski, I can't ride,
I can't speak Latin.

46:31.040 --> 46:34.752
My legs only come up to here and yes,
I will always be a little bit fat.

46:34.919 --> 46:38.506
And you, you fold your underpants
before you go to bed.

46:38.673 --> 46:42.134
- Now, hang on, that can't be a reason.
- No, it's not a reason.

46:42.301 --> 46:44.387
But you're not perfect either.

46:44.554 --> 46:47.306
You look down your nose
at absolutely everyone,

46:47.473 --> 46:52.186
and you're incapable of doing anything
spontaneous or potentially affectionate.

46:52.353 --> 46:55.731
It feels like you're waiting
to find someone in the VIP room

46:55.898 --> 46:58.484
who's, who's so fantastic...

46:59.277 --> 47:01.279
just the way she is,

47:01.445 --> 47:04.115
that you don't need to fix her.

47:04.282 --> 47:05.867
Bridget, this is mad.

47:06.033 --> 47:08.494
Perhaps you've already found her.

47:12.165 --> 47:14.458
Do you want to marry me?

47:16.586 --> 47:18.671
Look, I...

47:20.798 --> 47:23.885
You see, you can never
muster the strength...

47:25.136 --> 47:27.471
to fight for me.

47:46.866 --> 47:49.202
[Bridget] I can't believe I did that.

48:25.822 --> 48:30.660
# What do I gotta do
to make you love me?

48:33.329 --> 48:37.708
# What do I gotta do to make you care?

48:37.875 --> 48:39.669
[Dog barks]

48:40.711 --> 48:45.800
# What do I gotta do
when lightning strikes me

48:45.967 --> 48:47.468
# Hmm

48:48.344 --> 48:52.473
# And I wake to find
that you're not there?

48:55.852 --> 49:00.565
# What do I gotta do
to make you want me?

49:01.065 --> 49:02.358
# Hmm

49:03.317 --> 49:07.738
# What do I gotta do to be heard?

49:07.905 --> 49:09.907
[Siren]

49:10.658 --> 49:16.205
# And what do I say
when it's all over, babe?

49:16.372 --> 49:17.874
# Oooh-ooh

49:18.040 --> 49:22.420
# And sorry seems to be the hardest word

49:25.548 --> 49:29.218
# It's sad
So sad

49:29.385 --> 49:32.930
# Why can't we talk it over, babe?

49:33.097 --> 49:35.641
# Always seems to me

49:36.058 --> 49:40.646
# When sorry seems to be

49:41.439 --> 49:45.818
# The hardest word #

49:49.489 --> 49:51.657
[Bridget] Five weeks later.

49:51.824 --> 49:54.702
Weight: 4,000 pounds.

49:54.869 --> 49:59.081
Am enjoying a relationship with two men
simultaneously.

49:59.248 --> 50:02.585
The first is called Ben,
the other, Jerry.

50:02.752 --> 50:06.047
Number of current boyfriends: Zero.

50:06.214 --> 50:08.549
Number of calls from ex-boyfriend:

50:08.716 --> 50:12.053
[Electronic voice]
You have absolutely no messages.

50:12.220 --> 50:15.890
Not a single one.
Not even from your mother.

50:16.599 --> 50:18.643
[Telephone]

50:21.771 --> 50:24.190
- Hello?
- Hello, darling.

50:24.357 --> 50:28.236
- You haven't forgotten our lunch date?
- [Bridget] Of course I have.

50:28.402 --> 50:31.489
- I'm suicidally depressed.
- Don't be silly, Bridget.

50:31.656 --> 50:34.116
Meet me at Debenhams at twelve o'clock.

50:35.284 --> 50:38.371
Mum... I thought we were going
to have something to eat.

50:38.538 --> 50:42.333
[Mum] Patience, please. I've got
a big surprise for you, darling.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.087
- What?
- Don't say "what", say "pardon".

50:48.047 --> 50:49.799
[Shrill] Tra-la!

50:49.966 --> 50:53.010
- What do you think?
- Oh, my God.

50:53.177 --> 50:55.221
Daddy and I are getting married.

50:55.388 --> 50:58.182
- You're already married.
- We're doing it again.

50:58.349 --> 51:01.686
Reaffirming our vows.
You are going to be a bridesmaid,

51:01.853 --> 51:04.730
and absolutely everything
is going to be lavender.

51:04.897 --> 51:07.441
And when I say everything, I mean...

51:07.984 --> 51:09.527
...everything.

51:10.236 --> 51:11.612
[Laughs]

51:11.779 --> 51:14.031
Oh, God, I'm never going to get married

51:14.198 --> 51:16.784
and my sodding mum and dad
are doing it twice.

51:16.951 --> 51:20.913
# No more candlelight
No more romance

51:21.080 --> 51:24.584
- # No more small talk...
- [Bridget] Bloody know-it-all.

51:26.460 --> 51:30.381
New York: The Big, Juicy Apple.

51:30.548 --> 51:34.510
The city that never sleeps
with the same person two nights running.

51:34.677 --> 51:38.931
My favorite place in America, where Sex
And The City isn't just a program,

51:39.098 --> 51:41.058
it's a promise.

51:42.768 --> 51:44.145
[Bell]

51:44.937 --> 51:47.106
- [Phone rings]
- [Man] Morning, Rach.

51:47.273 --> 51:49.066
Sorry.

51:49.233 --> 51:52.987
Oh, cheer up, misery guts.
I have good news for you.

51:53.154 --> 51:55.156
[Chuckles] Sure, right.

51:55.323 --> 51:58.409
What's the angle?
I interview some rocket scientist

51:58.576 --> 52:01.537
while he looks through my skirt
with X-ray glasses?

52:01.704 --> 52:03.206
No.

52:03.831 --> 52:05.833
Although that is a bloody good idea.

52:06.459 --> 52:10.505
No. The fact is The Smooth Guide
is doing very well with women,

52:10.671 --> 52:15.176
but the network want us to cast
a wider net and use a Smooth Guide-ess.

52:15.343 --> 52:18.554
Me? With Daniel Cleaver?

52:18.721 --> 52:22.600
It's the next logical step.
I think Thailand is first on the list.

52:22.767 --> 52:25.436
No. I won't do it.

52:25.603 --> 52:28.397
Not now.
Not in a million years from now.

52:28.564 --> 52:31.317
- Excuse me?
- I am a top television journalist,

52:31.484 --> 52:33.736
not some boorish bint in a bikini.

52:33.903 --> 52:38.449
Really? Strong words from somebody
who doesn't know where Germany is.

52:38.616 --> 52:40.910
- [Sniggering]
- Who told you that?

52:41.077 --> 52:44.622
Cleaver. He said he couldn't be expected
to go out with someone

52:44.872 --> 52:49.877
who thought Iran was David Bowie's wife,
and who didn't know where Germany was.

52:50.753 --> 52:57.218
Daniel Cleaver is a deceitful, sexist,
disgusting specimen of humanity,

52:57.385 --> 53:00.096
that I wouldn't share a lift with,
let alone a job.

53:00.263 --> 53:03.933
Come on, Jones, there must have been
something you liked about me.

53:04.100 --> 53:07.311
Well... you have a nice car.

53:08.396 --> 53:11.524
And quite nice manners.
Outside the bedroom.

53:11.691 --> 53:13.734
But that's about it.

53:14.277 --> 53:16.904
And by the way,
I know exactly where Germany is.

53:17.071 --> 53:20.533
The question is do you know the location
of your arsehole?

53:24.620 --> 53:29.584
As a matter of fact, I do know the
exact location of my arsehole. And hers.

53:31.002 --> 53:33.713
Oh, come on, Jones,
it was just a silly joke.

53:33.880 --> 53:35.423
Not a very funny one.

53:35.590 --> 53:37.008
- Go on, then.
- What?

53:37.175 --> 53:39.177
Where is it? Where is Germany?

53:39.343 --> 53:42.138
- Next to France.
- And?

53:42.305 --> 53:44.640
And also Belgium...

53:44.807 --> 53:47.435
Poland. And it has a sea coast.

53:48.186 --> 53:50.605
Which sea?

53:57.695 --> 53:59.697
Oh, sod it. Now, look,

53:59.864 --> 54:02.617
I think we should talk
about Finch's suggestion.

54:02.783 --> 54:04.869
I am going to Thailand, Jones.

54:05.036 --> 54:07.663
Wouldn't you like to be
my little Girl Guide?

54:07.955 --> 54:08.915
Thailand?

54:09.081 --> 54:12.793
- You'll shag before you leave Heathrow.
- I'll be perfectly fine.

54:12.960 --> 54:15.046
I'm eschewing all men.

54:15.630 --> 54:18.466
And cigarettes. And carbohydrates.

54:18.633 --> 54:21.511
- We can't possibly let you go.
- On your own.

54:21.677 --> 54:23.679
Oh, stop it, all of you.

54:23.846 --> 54:26.682
I am a mature, sophisticated,
professional woman

54:26.849 --> 54:31.604
and I'm going to Thailand
entirely on my own, thank you very much.

54:31.771 --> 54:33.231
- [Shazzer] Fuck!
- Sorry.

54:33.397 --> 54:35.483
- Fuckity fuck.
- Sorry.

54:35.650 --> 54:40.238
[Pilot] And now our final passengers
have joined us, we can get underway.

54:40.404 --> 54:42.490
Someone's gotta be last.

54:43.783 --> 54:46.828
- [Crunching]
- [Bridget] Are we not sitting together?

54:46.994 --> 54:48.996
Oh, fuck.

54:51.791 --> 54:54.710
I don't think we're really
in a position to, um...

54:55.461 --> 54:58.047
...make a fuss.
Sorry. Hi.

54:58.673 --> 55:00.967
- Sorry.
- [Man chuckles]

55:02.218 --> 55:03.886
[Woman] What's our film?

55:04.720 --> 55:07.098
What's your name? Mine's Olive.

55:07.265 --> 55:09.267
- Er, Bridget.
- [Olive chuckles]

55:09.433 --> 55:12.436
[Pilot] Good afternoon again,
ladies and gentlemen.

55:12.603 --> 55:15.523
We're about to offer a wide range
of duty-free items.

55:15.690 --> 55:18.401
Details can be found
in your in-flight magazine.

55:18.568 --> 55:20.361
[Baby cries]

55:26.200 --> 55:30.413
Wonderful people, the Thais.
Particularly the young ladies.

55:30.580 --> 55:32.582
If you know what I mean, eh?

55:32.748 --> 55:35.459
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- Come with me.

55:35.626 --> 55:37.837
Come with me now.

55:38.004 --> 55:40.548
- Where are we going?
- Just through here.

55:40.715 --> 55:42.842
Thank you. This is worse than school.

55:43.009 --> 55:45.136
It really wasn't my fault.

55:45.303 --> 55:47.680
It's a fizzy drink, you know, it just...

55:47.847 --> 55:50.057
It just sort of fizzied over.

55:51.434 --> 55:54.854
Couldn’t bear to think of you back there
in slum class, Jones.

55:55.021 --> 55:59.150
Graham, thank you. You are the best
air steward I've ever come across.

55:59.317 --> 56:01.402
And if I may say so, the smartest.

56:01.569 --> 56:03.029
Thank you, sir.

56:05.907 --> 56:08.701
I thought you were there already,
doing research.

56:08.868 --> 56:10.828
Fuck, no. I make it up as I go along.

56:10.995 --> 56:14.707
It's 13 hours for this trip.
I need some in-flight entertainment.

56:14.874 --> 56:18.544
Why don't you tell me, in detail,
about your school netball tour,

56:18.711 --> 56:22.215
particularly the unsavory incident
in the communal showers.

56:22.381 --> 56:25.468
I didn't play netball.
Or go to a girls' school.

56:25.635 --> 56:29.263
- Or have showers.
- Now that's just not true, is it?

56:29.430 --> 56:31.432
- Let me start you off.
- No.

56:31.599 --> 56:35.311
If you're gonna be dull, I'm going
to plunge back into Mrs. Dalloway,

56:35.478 --> 56:38.689
and you know how she loves that.
Dirty, dirty bitch.

57:00.378 --> 57:02.672
- [Elephant trumpets]
- # Here's a new thing

57:02.839 --> 57:04.507
# That's gonna please ya

57:04.674 --> 57:07.176
# Just a little town down in Indonesia

57:07.385 --> 57:08.469
# Bangkok...

57:08.636 --> 57:11.472
[Bridget] Arrived Bangkok. Very hot.

57:11.639 --> 57:15.643
Relieved at last to throw myself
into serious journalistic work.

57:17.687 --> 57:21.858
Thailand has long called travelers
from around the globe

57:22.024 --> 57:25.695
to take spiritual succour
and karmic rest.

57:25.862 --> 57:30.992
For centuries, Western visitors
have been inevitably drawn

57:31.159 --> 57:34.537
to some of Bangkok's oldest sanctuaries.

57:34.704 --> 57:38.291
So true, Bridget. Even I,
fight it as I may, am no exception.

57:38.457 --> 57:42.587
The moment I arrive here,
I almost feel an irresistible pull...

57:42.753 --> 57:46.507
...to this. The Temple of Tranquility.

57:47.216 --> 57:52.263
Indeed, nothing symbolizes Thailand's
extraordinary fusion of East and West,

57:52.430 --> 57:55.850
of tradition and innovation,
better than this.

57:56.017 --> 57:58.269
Fully body-to-body massage.

57:58.436 --> 58:00.855
- Sawatdee kha?
- Sawatdee khrab?

58:01.022 --> 58:05.443
An incredible thing about Thailand
is the amazing traditional cuisine.

58:05.610 --> 58:09.655
I'm going to taste kapaluk,
the ultimate delicacy.

58:11.532 --> 58:13.868
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

58:14.035 --> 58:16.037
Oh, my God. My God.

58:16.204 --> 58:18.748
Um... Er... Mmm.

58:18.915 --> 58:21.417
How about a lovely locust?

58:21.584 --> 58:23.753
I can't. No, no, I can't.

58:23.920 --> 58:25.963
- They're delicious.
- [Crunching]

58:28.299 --> 58:29.717
Oh!

58:32.678 --> 58:37.850
[Daniel] Now that is Ko Panyi, which is
the setting for a very famous Thai poem,

58:38.017 --> 58:40.353
which I think you'd like very much,
Jones.

58:40.520 --> 58:44.732
It's all about a badly-behaved prince
who finds true love with a beautiful,

58:44.899 --> 58:48.110
and as it happens,
very slightly overweight princess.

58:48.861 --> 58:52.448
- You're teasing me.
- I never tease about poetry.

58:53.199 --> 58:57.078
"Oh, Suvarnamali
Why can you not see that I adore you?"

58:57.245 --> 58:59.664
"Why do you avoid and scorn me?"

58:59.831 --> 59:01.833
"If you cast me off and leave me

59:01.999 --> 59:04.210
How should I live another day?"

59:07.213 --> 59:11.509
And you thought all I knew of Thailand
was pussies and ping-pong balls.

59:11.676 --> 59:14.720
- You wouldn't sleep with him?
- No, of course not.

59:14.887 --> 59:17.265
Absolutely not.

59:17.431 --> 59:19.517
But he is clever.

59:19.684 --> 59:21.227
- Yes?
- And handsome.

59:21.394 --> 59:24.939
He's also a dysfunctional,
fucked-up, middle-aged, lost boy.

59:25.106 --> 59:27.108
Well, no-one's perfect.

59:27.275 --> 59:28.901
[Birdsong]

59:32.071 --> 59:34.448
I didn't realize you were busy.

59:38.369 --> 59:42.081
- He's young enough to be your grandson.
- I know. Isn't that great?

59:43.166 --> 59:45.376
- [Man yells]
- [Ladies shriek]

59:45.543 --> 59:49.547
Come on, guys, I've got a very special
treat lined up for lunch.

59:49.714 --> 59:52.091
[Bridget]
I'm getting rather fond of Jed,

59:52.258 --> 59:55.636
and I must say he has a genuine interest
in Thai cuisine.

59:55.803 --> 59:59.724
[Bridget] I wouldn't have thought
omelet would be big in Thailand.

59:59.891 --> 1:00:03.519
- Or mushrooms, for that matter.
- [Jed] It's magic.

1:00:06.397 --> 1:00:09.400
It is a magic mushroom omelet,
isn't it?

1:00:09.984 --> 1:00:14.572
Well, that's awful.
There is nothing funny in this at all.

1:00:16.741 --> 1:00:18.743
Although, thank God,

1:00:19.368 --> 1:00:22.288
the mushrooms don't actually
seem to be working.

1:00:25.249 --> 1:00:27.126
[# Primal Scream: Loaded]

1:00:28.044 --> 1:00:30.254
# Just what is it
that you want to do?

1:00:31.547 --> 1:00:35.676
Such lovely colors! [gasps]

1:00:35.843 --> 1:00:38.846
# We wanna get loaded
And we wanna have a good time...

1:00:39.013 --> 1:00:43.768
Beautiful Bridget! Beautiful Bridget!
Beautiful Bridget!

1:00:46.437 --> 1:00:48.356
Bridget Jones!

1:00:51.150 --> 1:00:53.653
[Daniel's voice, distorted]
Bridget Jones!

1:00:53.820 --> 1:00:55.530
But, wait...

1:00:55.696 --> 1:00:59.033
- [Daniel, distorted] Bridget Jones?
- What sound is that?

1:01:04.664 --> 1:01:07.875
It is Daniel Cleaver. [echoes]

1:01:08.042 --> 1:01:11.963
[Thinks]
How unutterably beautiful he is.

1:01:13.464 --> 1:01:15.967
Jones, what the hell are you doing?

1:01:19.512 --> 1:01:22.348
[Bridget] You are lovely colors.

1:01:23.307 --> 1:01:26.060
- # I don't wanna lose your love...
- Here.

1:01:26.227 --> 1:01:28.312
Here I am.

1:01:29.147 --> 1:01:31.649
I think you're completely off your face.

1:01:33.025 --> 1:01:34.902
- Hey.
- [Bridget groans]

1:01:35.069 --> 1:01:38.114
- Bloody hell.
- [Bridget groans and sighs]

1:01:38.656 --> 1:01:41.701
Oh... Oh, I'm an angel.

1:01:42.660 --> 1:01:45.538
Oh. How lovely.

1:01:45.705 --> 1:01:48.082
Glorious sand.

1:01:48.249 --> 1:01:50.042
Oh.

1:01:50.209 --> 1:01:52.420
I want to be naked.

1:01:53.004 --> 1:01:57.383
- Naked as a baby.
- Come on, then, angel. Up you get.

1:01:57.550 --> 1:01:59.552
[Daniel strains]

1:02:00.636 --> 1:02:02.638
- All right?
- Mmm.

1:02:03.723 --> 1:02:07.226
- [Daniel] How are you feeling?
- Completely embarrassed.

1:02:07.393 --> 1:02:10.771
Don't be. You're charming on drugs.
In future, just say yes.

1:02:11.606 --> 1:02:16.777
Do you know, I never really understood
why you wanted to go out with me.

1:02:17.653 --> 1:02:20.615
- It seemed so unlikely.
- Come on. For God's sake.

1:02:20.781 --> 1:02:23.743
You're sexy. You make me laugh.

1:02:23.910 --> 1:02:26.329
At you, of course, not with you.

1:02:26.996 --> 1:02:29.040
And you were...

1:02:29.207 --> 1:02:31.000
...incidentally...

1:02:32.710 --> 1:02:34.504
...the best shag...

1:02:34.670 --> 1:02:36.297
...I ever had.

1:02:36.464 --> 1:02:38.049
The best?

1:02:38.216 --> 1:02:41.552
Aside from Simon Reade
in the fifth-form locker room, yeah.

1:02:42.553 --> 1:02:45.097
Suppose I said you were pretty good too?

1:02:47.183 --> 1:02:49.268
Pretty good?

1:02:50.353 --> 1:02:52.730
Was I better than Mark Darcy?

1:02:53.856 --> 1:02:58.277
By the way, is it true he always says
"I'm sorry, I think I'm going to come"?

1:02:58.444 --> 1:03:01.447
- Who told you that?
- It's common knowledge, isn't it?

1:03:02.698 --> 1:03:05.535
Come on, Jones. Who gave who the hoof?

1:03:05.701 --> 1:03:07.829
And why?

1:03:08.996 --> 1:03:11.040
Let's just say

1:03:11.207 --> 1:03:14.502
that we suffered
from a fatal incompatibility.

1:03:18.214 --> 1:03:20.424
I have missed you, Jones.

1:03:20.591 --> 1:03:23.344
I don't suppose
there's any circumstances

1:03:23.511 --> 1:03:25.888
in which you would ever consider

1:03:26.055 --> 1:03:28.850
thinking about trusting me again?

1:03:31.519 --> 1:03:33.521
Absolutely not.

1:03:40.027 --> 1:03:43.656
Well, I suppose I'll be getting back
to my little hut now.

1:03:44.407 --> 1:03:47.994
Thank you very much, Daniel.
I had a nice time.

1:03:59.547 --> 1:04:04.010
Is that the Big Dipper
or the little one?

1:04:04.177 --> 1:04:06.387
I can never tell them apart.

1:04:06.554 --> 1:04:08.306
Definitely the big one.

1:04:08.472 --> 1:04:11.517
You can't see the little one
this close to the equator.

1:04:11.684 --> 1:04:15.354
Oh, please.
You don't know about astronomy.

1:04:15.521 --> 1:04:18.065
I most certainly do.
I'm passionate about it.

1:04:20.443 --> 1:04:24.322
You know, Jones, if stargazing
is something that interests you,

1:04:24.489 --> 1:04:28.576
then it has to be said that the view
from my balcony is quite outstanding.

1:04:29.911 --> 1:04:32.872
Perhaps you'd like to come up
and have a little look?

1:04:33.039 --> 1:04:34.916
I don't think so.

1:04:35.082 --> 1:04:38.252
See over there? Along my arm.

1:04:38.419 --> 1:04:40.463
That's it, over there.

1:04:41.464 --> 1:04:43.799
That is Orion's Belt.

1:04:43.966 --> 1:04:49.263
And next to that is a very sexy little
constellation called Ursa's Maiden.

1:04:49.430 --> 1:04:50.473
Ah.

1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:54.018
She's being very naughty
and trying to undo Orion's belt.

1:04:55.019 --> 1:04:59.106
All right, what about...
that one?

1:05:00.107 --> 1:05:03.236
Yes, well that is
a very, very famous star.

1:05:03.402 --> 1:05:05.780
Um, right next to, of course, um...

1:05:05.947 --> 1:05:07.156
[chirruping]

1:05:07.990 --> 1:05:12.411
I don't know, some other fucking star
that's been there for years and years.

1:05:12.578 --> 1:05:15.915
Seen one star, you've seen the lot,
that's what I say, Jones.

1:05:19.460 --> 1:05:21.754
Different with girls, though.

1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:25.842
Some girls...

1:05:26.008 --> 1:05:28.010
...are special.

1:05:28.177 --> 1:05:30.304
Are they?

1:05:31.180 --> 1:05:33.182
I think so.

1:05:33.349 --> 1:05:35.768
[# 10cc: I'm Not In Love]

1:05:44.026 --> 1:05:47.238
What is this special power
you hold over me, Jones?

1:05:56.747 --> 1:05:58.958
And what about your therapy?

1:06:00.751 --> 1:06:02.837
I think you might be it.

1:06:03.004 --> 1:06:05.131
# I'm not in love

1:06:06.465 --> 1:06:08.467
# So don't forget it

1:06:09.969 --> 1:06:12.221
# It's just a silly phase

1:06:12.388 --> 1:06:14.390
# I'm going through

1:06:17.018 --> 1:06:19.061
# And just because

1:06:20.730 --> 1:06:22.732
# I call you up

1:06:24.233 --> 1:06:25.985
# Don't get me wrong

1:06:26.152 --> 1:06:29.113
# Don't think you've got it made

1:06:31.324 --> 1:06:33.326
# I'm not in love...

1:06:34.035 --> 1:06:36.871
God, I hope you're wearing
those giant panties.

1:06:37.038 --> 1:06:38.206
Please.

1:06:38.372 --> 1:06:41.334
[Smooching]
Please be wearing the giant panties.

1:06:41.501 --> 1:06:43.586
Please. [gasps]

1:06:43.753 --> 1:06:45.838
Oh, my old friends.

1:06:46.005 --> 1:06:48.758
Oh, Daddy's home.

1:06:48.925 --> 1:06:52.762
Did you miss me?
Because Daddy missed you. Yes, he did.

1:06:53.554 --> 1:06:55.139
Wait.

1:06:57.558 --> 1:06:59.143
Sorry.

1:06:59.310 --> 1:07:01.479
Can I just have a minute?

1:07:01.646 --> 1:07:03.648
Just a minute.

1:07:11.322 --> 1:07:13.825
[Thinks] Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1:07:13.991 --> 1:07:17.745
# Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

1:07:18.246 --> 1:07:21.833
# Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry...

1:07:32.176 --> 1:07:34.053
[sighs]

1:07:35.096 --> 1:07:38.850
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, sure.

1:07:39.892 --> 1:07:42.019
Just a bit... nervous. [chuckles]

1:07:43.271 --> 1:07:46.023
I mean, you see,
if I stay with you tonight,

1:07:46.190 --> 1:07:50.319
well, it's definitely
the end of something...

1:07:50.486 --> 1:07:52.697
important with someone.

1:07:52.864 --> 1:07:55.616
Um, which has probably ended already,

1:07:55.783 --> 1:07:58.744
- but perhaps...
- Bridge, Bridge Bridge, Bridge.

1:07:58.911 --> 1:08:01.330
Doesn't everyone
deserve a second chance?

1:08:03.332 --> 1:08:04.750
Hmm?

1:08:11.424 --> 1:08:13.259
Except Hitler.

1:08:14.927 --> 1:08:18.222
Well, he was very, very, very naughty.

1:08:20.099 --> 1:08:21.601
[Knocking]

1:08:24.437 --> 1:08:25.813
What?

1:08:25.980 --> 1:08:29.525
Nothing. Er, come back later, please.
Thank you very much.

1:08:30.735 --> 1:08:32.361
[Knocking]

1:08:33.571 --> 1:08:36.032
Bridge, it's nothing.
Leave it. Leave it.

1:08:38.743 --> 1:08:41.329
You made order for 10.30.

1:08:42.288 --> 1:08:44.332
Order for what?

1:08:45.374 --> 1:08:46.792
Me.

1:08:46.959 --> 1:08:48.711
10.30.

1:08:51.839 --> 1:08:54.509
You know, I've had it up to here
with this hotel.

1:08:54.675 --> 1:08:58.513
- It's been cock-ups like this all week.
- [Thai girl] You Mr. Cleaver?

1:08:58.679 --> 1:09:03.184
Yesterday, you with Maria.
She say you big tipper.

1:09:11.984 --> 1:09:13.945
[Mumbles]

1:09:14.111 --> 1:09:16.697
I mean, I'm up for it if you are.

1:09:17.824 --> 1:09:21.327
Actually, no, that was stupid.
It's just one little slip.

1:09:21.494 --> 1:09:25.164
Don't let it ruin what was gonna be
a fantastic weekend shagathon.

1:09:25.331 --> 1:09:28.543
- I don't want a shagathon.
- No, nor do I. Nor do I.

1:09:28.709 --> 1:09:31.838
- You're right.
- You're looking for a weekend of sex,

1:09:32.004 --> 1:09:35.216
- I'm looking...
- For more. I feel I can change.

1:09:35.383 --> 1:09:37.885
- I absolutely can change.
- I need to change.

1:09:38.052 --> 1:09:40.263
I can't believe I fell for it again.

1:09:40.429 --> 1:09:43.224
Daniel, I really do think

1:09:43.391 --> 1:09:46.185
that you should go and fuck yourself.

1:09:46.352 --> 1:09:50.231
Or her. But definitely not me.

1:09:50.398 --> 1:09:51.941
- # Think
- # Think

1:09:52.108 --> 1:09:54.527
# Think about
what you're trying to do to me

1:09:54.694 --> 1:09:56.279
- # Think
- # Think think

1:09:56.445 --> 1:09:57.655
# Let your mind go...

1:09:57.822 --> 1:10:00.491
I can't believe he made up
the sex therapy thing.

1:10:00.658 --> 1:10:03.119
Doesn't matter.
I finally learnt my lesson,

1:10:03.286 --> 1:10:06.080
and it's an excellent lesson
to have nailed.

1:10:06.747 --> 1:10:08.332
- Fuck!
- What?

1:10:08.499 --> 1:10:10.877
No fucking room in the fucking suitcase.

1:10:11.043 --> 1:10:13.462
There's room in mine. Give me something.

1:10:13.629 --> 1:10:15.423
Great.

1:10:15.590 --> 1:10:19.051
- What the hell is this?
- It is a fertility-snake bowl.

1:10:19.218 --> 1:10:21.637
- Ooh.
- Jed gave it to me.

1:10:21.804 --> 1:10:23.806
- # Think think
- # Let your mind go...

1:10:23.973 --> 1:10:25.391
How romantic.

1:10:25.558 --> 1:10:26.726
# Freedom...

1:10:26.893 --> 1:10:31.105
The way I look at it, in everyone's
life, there's a certain amount of shit.

1:10:31.272 --> 1:10:33.816
- That's true.
- In the last year,

1:10:33.983 --> 1:10:36.486
things have turned out pretty shitty.

1:10:36.652 --> 1:10:38.821
So logically, mathematically, even,

1:10:38.988 --> 1:10:41.949
it's got to be time
for something not shit.

1:10:42.116 --> 1:10:46.913
- [Shazzer] Like what?
- Maybe Mark will have chucked Rebecca.

1:10:47.079 --> 1:10:49.499
And he'll run to my door,

1:10:49.665 --> 1:10:53.961
fall to his knees,
possibly wearing a wet white shirt,

1:10:54.128 --> 1:10:56.005
and beg me to come back.

1:10:56.172 --> 1:10:57.423
- # Think
- # Think

1:10:57.590 --> 1:11:00.426
# Think about
what you're tryin' to do to me...

1:11:00.593 --> 1:11:06.140
Yes, I very confidently expect
very, very good times ahead.

1:11:06.307 --> 1:11:08.976
[PA] Final call
for all passengers to London...

1:11:09.143 --> 1:11:12.146
Isn't he cute? Hello.

1:11:12.647 --> 1:11:14.232
Hello. Oh...

1:11:14.398 --> 1:11:17.401
Seems to be getting a bit excited.
[Laughs]

1:11:18.027 --> 1:11:19.570
Oh.

1:11:19.737 --> 1:11:21.197
Er...

1:11:22.532 --> 1:11:25.785
- [Shazzer] Bridget!
- It's just a misunderstanding.

1:11:25.952 --> 1:11:27.662
Hold the plane.

1:11:27.829 --> 1:11:29.664
Hold the plane.

1:11:29.831 --> 1:11:31.958
[Shazzer] Excuse me! Excuse me!

1:11:32.124 --> 1:11:36.963
[PA] All remaining passengers
please report to Gate 27 immediately.

1:11:43.427 --> 1:11:44.846
[Thud]

1:11:45.012 --> 1:11:47.014
It's not mine.

1:11:47.181 --> 1:11:49.642
- These yours?
- Yes.

1:11:49.809 --> 1:11:52.019
I mean, they're not my favorite pair.

1:11:53.604 --> 1:11:55.398
[Siren]

1:12:00.903 --> 1:12:02.280
[Brakes screech]

1:12:04.532 --> 1:12:06.576
You can't do this. I'm English.

1:12:06.742 --> 1:12:08.953
And an award-winning journalist.

1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:13.624
Well, maybe not award-winning, but I
have been to lots of award ceremonies.

1:12:13.791 --> 1:12:15.793
[Door rattles and clangs]

1:12:20.256 --> 1:12:21.799
[Clang]

1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:25.761
Hello. Bridget Jones.

1:12:28.347 --> 1:12:30.516
Lovely to meet all of you.

1:12:32.727 --> 1:12:35.188
[Bridget] Oh, my bloody God and fuck.

1:12:35.354 --> 1:12:37.940
I hope they've told
the British ambassador.

1:12:38.107 --> 1:12:40.776
Surely Shazzer
would have raised the alert.

1:12:40.943 --> 1:12:43.196
Maybe they got Shazzer as well.

1:12:44.489 --> 1:12:46.908
[Woman speaks Thai]

1:12:50.244 --> 1:12:53.247
Oh, God, 28 hours.

1:12:54.123 --> 1:12:56.083
How much longer?

1:12:56.250 --> 1:12:59.086
[Man] Jones.
Bridget Jones, you come now.

1:13:02.673 --> 1:13:03.716
[Clang]

1:13:08.179 --> 1:13:11.349
Charlie Parker-Knowles,
Assistant Consul.

1:13:11.516 --> 1:13:13.768
Thank God you're here.

1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:17.355
Um, shall we...

1:13:17.522 --> 1:13:20.650
I really had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

1:13:20.817 --> 1:13:22.819
Jed planned the whole thing.

1:13:22.985 --> 1:13:26.072
That's why he snogged Shazzer,

1:13:28.407 --> 1:13:30.952
Yes, he sounds the most frightful shit.

1:13:31.118 --> 1:13:32.411
Mmm.

1:13:32.578 --> 1:13:37.083
The bore is everyone who gets caught
has exactly the same story,

1:13:37.250 --> 1:13:42.046
so unless we find this, this Jed fellow
and get a full confession,

1:13:42.213 --> 1:13:44.340
you're on a bit of a sticky wicket.

1:13:44.966 --> 1:13:46.884
Well, how sticky?

1:13:47.051 --> 1:13:49.387
Something like 15 to 20 years.

1:13:49.554 --> 1:13:53.141
- [Whispers] 15 years?
- Or maybe ten if we're lucky.

1:13:53.307 --> 1:13:55.309
Ten years!

1:13:55.476 --> 1:13:57.854
In here?

1:14:10.449 --> 1:14:12.577
[Bridget] Very black.

1:14:12.743 --> 1:14:16.914
All my life I've had the feeling
something terrible was about to happen.

1:14:17.707 --> 1:14:19.917
Now it has.

1:14:22.086 --> 1:14:24.088
Bijjit, right?

1:14:24.255 --> 1:14:26.215
Bridget, actually.

1:14:26.382 --> 1:14:28.217
My name Phrao.

1:14:28.384 --> 1:14:30.386
You're my friend?

1:14:36.642 --> 1:14:38.728
- Steady on!
- Superbra!

1:14:38.895 --> 1:14:42.106
You lend me. One day, two cigarette.

1:14:42.940 --> 1:14:44.901
Oh. [laughs]

1:14:45.067 --> 1:14:47.320
Well, I'll think about it.

1:14:48.154 --> 1:14:50.490
Actually, I was thinking of giving up,

1:14:50.656 --> 1:14:54.118
but that was before I was arrested
and thrown into a Thai prison

1:14:54.285 --> 1:14:56.913
for ten to 15 years. [laughs]

1:14:57.497 --> 1:14:59.749

1:15:01.709 --> 1:15:05.004
No, it really, really is "touched".

1:15:05.588 --> 1:15:10.218
"Like a vir-gin,
touched for the very first time".

1:15:10.384 --> 1:15:11.928
- No, you wrong.
- No.

1:15:12.094 --> 1:15:14.055
# Like a wersion

1:15:14.222 --> 1:15:17.099
- Vir-gin.
- # Fucked for the very first time

1:15:17.266 --> 1:15:20.978
- Touched.
- # Like a wersion

1:15:21.145 --> 1:15:23.314
[Bridget] Ten years of this? I

1:15:23.481 --> 1:15:26.317
Stop! Enough. Enough.

1:15:26.484 --> 1:15:30.279
If you're going to do it,
you really ought to do it properly.

1:15:30.905 --> 1:15:36.327
After all, Madonna is nothing
if not a perfectionist.

I can't believe
you've come all this way.

1:17:00.369 --> 1:17:03.748
I haven't. I was out here
handling a Foreign Office case

1:17:03.915 --> 1:17:05.917
when I heard about your situation.

1:17:06.083 --> 1:17:08.586
I haven't done anything wrong.

1:17:08.753 --> 1:17:11.380
I promise you, it's all a big mistake.

1:17:11.547 --> 1:17:14.050
Yes, well, I'm sure it is.

1:17:14.217 --> 1:17:17.386
I've got all the papers here
and I'm sure we can sort it out.

1:17:17.553 --> 1:17:22.058
I think about you all the time.
And I'm so sorry,

1:17:22.225 --> 1:17:26.562
I really, really am,
for everything that happened between us.

1:17:26.729 --> 1:17:28.773
Yes, well... [clears throat]

1:17:28.940 --> 1:17:32.777
We don't have much time and I need you
to identify someone for me.

1:17:32.944 --> 1:17:36.906
Is this the man with whom you were
seen taking hallucinogenic mushrooms

1:17:37.073 --> 1:17:39.742
before you spent the night
with Daniel Cleaver?

1:17:39.909 --> 1:17:42.662
Yes, that's him,
but I think you should know...

1:17:42.829 --> 1:17:45.998
The same man who gave you
the snake containing the drugs?

1:17:46.165 --> 1:17:48.584
Yes, that's him, that's Jed.

1:17:48.751 --> 1:17:50.837
But it was Shazzer's snake, not mine,

1:17:51.003 --> 1:17:53.297
and as far as Daniel Cleaver goes...

1:17:53.464 --> 1:17:56.592
Your sex life doesn't concern me at all.

1:18:07.895 --> 1:18:10.439
Has there been any ill treatment here?

1:18:11.023 --> 1:18:14.652
No, no. Well, I mean...

1:18:15.278 --> 1:18:18.114
...the toilet facilities
are well below par, but...

1:18:18.281 --> 1:18:20.283
Good, that makes things simpler.

1:18:23.828 --> 1:18:27.039
Listen, they're prepared
to drop all charges against you

1:18:27.206 --> 1:18:30.710
which is extremely lenient,
given the circumstances.

1:18:30.877 --> 1:18:33.421
You're going to be out within a week.

You're welcome. I'm just the messenger.
The order came from above.

1:19:13.419 --> 1:19:16.255
Well, good luck.
Glad I could be of help.

1:19:46.744 --> 1:19:49.872
This is terrible! You are innocent!

1:19:50.039 --> 1:19:53.751
- They're always cheating us.
- No, no, no. That's all fine.

1:19:53.918 --> 1:19:57.380
They've dropped the charges
and they're letting me go.

1:19:57.547 --> 1:19:59.507
But that good news.

1:19:59.674 --> 1:20:01.759
What is wrong?

1:20:02.885 --> 1:20:05.680
Mark Darcy definitely...

1:20:05.847 --> 1:20:08.432
...doesn't love me anymore.

1:20:08.599 --> 1:20:10.434
[All] Ohhh.

1:20:11.102 --> 1:20:13.855
You see the trouble is
it was me who chucked him.

1:20:14.021 --> 1:20:16.149
[Phrao] He treat you bad?

1:20:16.315 --> 1:20:18.317
Yeah, actually, he did.

1:20:18.484 --> 1:20:20.820

1:20:20.987 --> 1:20:22.613
- Me too.
- [Girl] Mine as well.

Then you know all about it.
You think you've found the right man,

1:20:28.035 --> 1:20:30.454
but then there's so much wrong with him

1:20:30.621 --> 1:20:34.876
and he finds there's so much wrong
with you and it all just falls apart.

1:20:35.042 --> 1:20:37.461
Don't tell me. My boyfriend,

1:20:37.628 --> 1:20:39.630
he seem really nice.

1:20:39.797 --> 1:20:43.885
Then he start to hit me.
Make me work on street.

1:20:44.051 --> 1:20:46.471
My boyfriend, he say he love me.

1:20:46.637 --> 1:20:50.433
But he do no work,
and make me work 24 hour a day.

1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:52.768
Then he make me take heroin drug.

1:20:52.935 --> 1:20:56.606
What about you, Bijjit?
What your bad boyfriend do?

1:20:58.065 --> 1:21:00.109
Well, er...

...he really didn't stick up for me
at this lawyers' supper...

1:21:04.947 --> 1:21:09.494

they were you were out.

1:26:03.955 --> 1:26:06.791
I rather thought Mark might be here
to meet you.

1:26:06.958 --> 1:26:09.460
Yes, but you must remember we split up.

1:26:09.627 --> 1:26:11.921
So no hope there?

1:26:12.088 --> 1:26:14.090
No hope there.

I'm so sorry.

It's all right.

1:27:55.066 --> 1:27:59.028
Well, thank God for Mark Darcy.
I mean, he might be a boring arse,

1:27:59.195 --> 1:28:01.322
but he performed a miracle.

1:28:02.615 --> 1:28:05.117
That's a bit of an overstatement.

1:28:05.785 --> 1:28:08.496
He actually seems
to be the villain of this piece.

1:28:09.121 --> 1:28:13.960
He's a top human rights lawyer and he
left it to someone else to get me out.

1:28:14.126 --> 1:28:16.254
He was just a messenger.

1:28:17.255 --> 1:28:20.091
- [Tom] Who told you that?
- He did.

Straight from the horse's mouth.

1:28:23.219 --> 1:28:25.972
The horse wasn't quite
telling you the truth.

1:28:26.139 --> 1:28:28.558
I called Mark
the minute I landed in London.

1:28:28.724 --> 1:28:31.185
We went to his office
and within half an hour,

1:28:31.352 --> 1:28:34.355
he'd woken two Cabinet ministers
and half of Ml5.

1:28:34.522 --> 1:28:38.609
But none of them could locate Jed,
so Mark flew over to Interpol.

1:28:38.776 --> 1:28:41.154
Which is in Lyon.
They located Jed in Dubai,

1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:43.948
but they don't normally
extradite people,

1:28:44.115 --> 1:28:47.493
so Mark rang the Home Secretary
who rang our ambassador...

1:28:47.660 --> 1:28:50.955
In Riyadh. Then Mark flew to Dubai
where he identified Jed,

1:28:51.122 --> 1:28:53.499
who was impounded and pushed out into...

1:28:53.666 --> 1:28:56.669
Saudi Arabia, where Mark was waiting
with the police.

1:28:56.836 --> 1:29:01.257
Jed was arrested and extradited back
to Britain. Then Mark flew to Bangkok,

1:29:01.424 --> 1:29:04.552
to make damn sure they'd let you go.

1:29:05.470 --> 1:29:07.096
Oh.

1:29:11.350 --> 1:29:14.103
He was just angry about Daniel Cleaver.

1:29:16.814 --> 1:29:19.817
- He must still love me.
- He fucking must.

1:29:20.401 --> 1:29:22.195

Do you want to come in?

1:30:13.663 --> 1:30:17.041
Oh, no. No, no, I don't think I will.

that you'll be happy together.

- You and Mark.
