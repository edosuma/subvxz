WEBVTT

00:01.022 --> 00:03.992
The board of the Royal Ontario Museum?

00:03.993 --> 00:06.261
What, you got a problem with that?

00:06.262 --> 00:07.578
That is really something.

00:07.596 --> 00:09.865
Well, yeah. What's wrong
with being civic-minded?

00:09.866 --> 00:11.633
It's hardly your strong suit.

00:11.634 --> 00:13.135
Well, if you must know,

00:13.136 --> 00:16.238
I've decided it's high
time I went legit.

00:16.239 --> 00:19.107
God knows this place
could use some livening up.

00:19.108 --> 00:21.209
I mean, look at them. Deadly dull!

00:21.210 --> 00:23.244
Yet well-heeled and
ripe for the picking.

00:24.379 --> 00:26.582
Why must you always think
so poorly of your mother?

00:26.583 --> 00:28.784
Who, by the way, didn't ask you here

00:28.785 --> 00:30.452
- to get a lecture.
- So, why am I here?

00:33.256 --> 00:36.825
I didn't set out to find treasures

00:36.826 --> 00:38.493
of lost civilizations.

00:38.494 --> 00:40.429
That happened quite by chance.

00:40.430 --> 00:42.898
On an overnight train to Marseilles,

00:42.899 --> 00:46.768
I met the renowned
archeologist Howard Carter.

00:46.769 --> 00:49.137
What a charmer.

00:49.138 --> 00:51.907
He persuaded me to go with him

00:51.908 --> 00:54.142
to the Valley of the Kings,

00:54.143 --> 00:56.945
where he was looking
for the lost tombs

00:56.946 --> 00:58.680
of the pharaohs.

00:58.681 --> 01:01.817
Digging in the sand
has been my passion

01:01.818 --> 01:04.986
- ever since.
- I thought you two should meet.

01:04.988 --> 01:06.955
You know,
the whole Egypt thing and all.

01:06.956 --> 01:09.057
Marian and I have
crossed paths before.

01:09.058 --> 01:11.560
You don't say. Where?

01:11.561 --> 01:14.730
- Here and there.
- Care to elaborate?

01:14.731 --> 01:18.065
- No.
- C'mon, what's the big secret?

01:22.904 --> 01:25.121
Working with Hiram Bingham III

01:25.122 --> 01:28.910
in the lost city of Machu Picchu,

01:28.911 --> 01:30.945
I excavated

01:30.946 --> 01:35.250
in the field of a
dirt poor farmer who,

01:35.251 --> 01:37.719
like his forefathers before him,

01:37.720 --> 01:41.990
feeds his family with the
work of his honest hands.

01:41.991 --> 01:44.759
In the very same dirt,

01:44.760 --> 01:48.329
I unearthed... this.

01:50.366 --> 01:53.501
And now, thanks to Ms. Amory,

01:53.502 --> 01:56.392
this marvellous example

01:56.393 --> 01:59.328
of 15th century Incan earthenware

01:59.329 --> 02:01.263
will be the centrepiece

02:01.264 --> 02:04.600
of the ROM's
new antiquities collection.

02:04.601 --> 02:06.134
Very nice!

02:10.240 --> 02:12.173
Please, yes.

02:14.476 --> 02:16.845
- That's something?
- Isn't it just.

02:16.846 --> 02:18.846
How much does she want for it?

02:19.815 --> 02:21.584
10000, give or take.

02:21.585 --> 02:23.419
It's gonna make a fabulous splash.

02:23.420 --> 02:25.487
I bet it will.
And as Marian's champion,

02:25.488 --> 02:27.423
I'm sure you'll just bask in the glow.

02:27.424 --> 02:29.724
And wouldn't that be swell?

02:33.228 --> 02:35.164
That's my brother.

02:35.165 --> 02:37.433
My condolences, Mr. Parkes.

02:37.434 --> 02:38.767
His full name and address?

02:38.768 --> 02:41.303
Jack Arthur Parkes.

02:41.304 --> 02:42.972
1025 Rusholme Road.

02:42.973 --> 02:45.307
Your particulars,
should we need to reach you?

02:45.308 --> 02:47.242
Ronald Parkes.

02:47.243 --> 02:48.810
210 Prospect Street.

02:51.614 --> 02:53.916
I'll make arrangements for burial.

02:53.917 --> 02:55.216
No funeral?

02:56.385 --> 02:59.153
- He wasn't a religious man.
- Not all of us are.

03:00.656 --> 03:02.057
Your brother's belongings.

03:02.058 --> 03:03.759
Again, my sympathies, Mr. Parkes.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.526
Thank you.

03:09.264 --> 03:12.468
Well, yes, I would say
I've lived an adventurous life.

03:12.469 --> 03:14.937
Excuse me. Excuse us.

03:14.938 --> 03:17.640
These provincial types love
to ogle anyone exotic.

03:17.641 --> 03:20.275
But here is someone I think you know.

03:20.276 --> 03:24.079
- Hello, Marian.
- Frankie Drake.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.016
- Long time.
- You've been busy since Cairo.

03:27.017 --> 03:28.917
Small world? How 'bout that?

03:28.918 --> 03:31.286
I didn't know you were
living in Toronto.

03:31.287 --> 03:33.355
And you thought
you'd seen the last of me.

03:33.356 --> 03:35.491
- I'm sorry to disappoint.
- Well, you girls sure

03:35.492 --> 03:37.192
seem pleased to be
reacquainted, but...

03:37.193 --> 03:40.629
Excuse me. I mustn't keep
the patrons waiting.

03:40.630 --> 03:42.897
No, of course not. You go right ahead.

03:44.466 --> 03:45.768
What the heck was that all about?

03:45.769 --> 03:48.203
She was nowhere near
Howard Carter's dig in Egypt.

03:48.204 --> 03:49.972
- What are you talking about?
- The overnight train

03:49.973 --> 03:51.640
- to Marseilles? That was me.
- What?!

03:51.641 --> 03:53.842
"He persuaded me to go
to the Valley of the Kings...

03:53.843 --> 03:55.944
he was looking for the lost
tombs of the pharaohs..."

03:55.945 --> 03:58.313
- I told you that story!
- Yeah, well, the details

03:58.314 --> 04:00.149
do sound vaguely familiar
now that you mention it.

04:00.150 --> 04:02.117
- No kidding.
- Frankie!

04:02.118 --> 04:04.920
Come on, let it go. Honestly!

04:04.921 --> 04:07.823
What interesting person hasn't
exaggerated a thing or two

04:07.824 --> 04:09.458
- about their past?
- Well, not me.

04:09.459 --> 04:10.926
- Well...
- I'm sure you don't want

04:10.927 --> 04:13.294
- to hear that Marian is a fraud.
- Stop it!

04:15.164 --> 04:17.598
Stop trying to spoil this
for me, Frankie.

04:20.235 --> 04:22.538
So, chop suey
or something more adventurous?

04:22.539 --> 04:23.872
Ooh, what did you have in mind?

04:23.873 --> 04:25.941
Well, there's this restaurant
serving this chicken thing,

04:25.942 --> 04:27.976
and it's called coq Au vin.

04:27.977 --> 04:32.081
Coq Au vin? Coq... It's French.

04:32.082 --> 04:34.583
- No.
- Well, all right, then.

04:34.584 --> 04:36.952
We can just go to Quon's. What's that?

04:36.953 --> 04:38.654
This wasn't here this morning.

04:38.655 --> 04:40.689
It must've fallen off
Jack Parkes' hand

04:40.690 --> 04:41.790
when they brought him in.

04:42.691 --> 04:44.993
"To My Beloved Husband. Love Ingrid."

04:44.994 --> 04:46.528
Flo, it's his wedding ring.

04:46.529 --> 04:48.597
- I gotta return it.
- Well, absolutely!

04:48.598 --> 04:51.033
His wife will want a keepsake
of her lost love.

04:51.034 --> 04:54.002
Funny. The brother didn't
mention a wife.

04:54.003 --> 04:56.205
1025 Rusholme Road.

04:56.206 --> 04:57.673
Fancy a tram ride?

04:57.674 --> 04:59.006
Yes!

05:01.043 --> 05:04.012
- 1025 Rusholme Road.
- It's quite the fancy place.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.980
- Ahem!
- Excuse us.

05:09.218 --> 05:10.586
Flo, I think this is...

05:10.587 --> 05:11.887
A nunnery.

05:11.888 --> 05:13.455
I guess Ronald Parkes made a mistake.

05:13.456 --> 05:15.190
Easy to do under the circumstances.

05:15.191 --> 05:16.891
- No problem. I got his address.
- Right.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.493
Hey.

05:25.667 --> 05:28.603
This must be it. 210 Prospect Street.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.273
It's another wrong address.
That's odd.

05:31.274 --> 05:33.108
I don't think so.

05:33.109 --> 05:35.877
One wrong address is a mistake.
Two is a lie.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:50.793 --> 05:52.961
So, a nunnery and an empty lot.

05:52.962 --> 05:55.264
Someone is messing
with the integrity of my morgue.

05:55.265 --> 05:57.666
Well, if the addresses are
fake, the names could be too.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.268
I don't understand it. I checked out

05:59.269 --> 06:02.471
the coroner's reports.
John Parkes, or whoever he is,

06:02.472 --> 06:05.574
he died of a heart attack.
It was textbook. No fuss.

06:05.575 --> 06:07.742
But tell them
about the inscription, Flo.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.914
Whoever the dead man was,
he has a wife named Ingrid.

06:11.915 --> 06:14.082
And she needs to know
what happened to him.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.018
We're here for you, Flo.
What do you need from us?

06:16.019 --> 06:18.420
I can ask Bill to take a sneak
peek in the city records.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.455
See what he can find
on the elusive Parkes family.

06:20.456 --> 06:23.192
What about the dead man's
photograph and fingerprints?

06:23.193 --> 06:24.693
None on record.

06:26.429 --> 06:27.969
But there's one way we can get them.

06:35.904 --> 06:37.339
You sure dress nice for grave digging.

06:37.340 --> 06:39.674
Well, what did you expect,
a miner's helmet?

06:40.976 --> 06:42.110
Yes!

06:42.111 --> 06:44.246
Jeepers. Sorry to be so gruff.

06:44.247 --> 06:45.314
No, no, no.

06:45.315 --> 06:47.449
No, these tears aren't for you.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.683
OK.

06:52.654 --> 06:54.656
Cemetery's closing for today.

06:54.657 --> 06:56.291
I see that.

06:56.292 --> 06:58.426
You know...

06:59.561 --> 07:01.230
He died...

07:01.231 --> 07:03.732
in my arms a year ago this day...

07:03.733 --> 07:07.269
And so we... we walked
all the way here.

07:07.270 --> 07:09.304
It was four or five miles.

07:09.305 --> 07:12.707
And... I brought him these flowers...

07:14.009 --> 07:16.678
because it was
such a special day, you see.

07:16.679 --> 07:19.047
I would really appreciate it.

07:19.048 --> 07:21.049
Thank you. This is my friend.

07:21.050 --> 07:23.517
Thank you. You're very kind, sir.

07:28.190 --> 07:30.058
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

07:32.762 --> 07:35.029
It's Jack Arthur Parkes.
Parkes with an E.

07:36.465 --> 07:38.867
- OK.
- And there should be

07:38.868 --> 07:40.535
some records on his brother,
Ronald, as well.

07:40.536 --> 07:42.470
I'll check as soon
as the secretaries leave.

07:44.239 --> 07:46.008
Why'd you want to know, anyway?

07:46.009 --> 07:47.142
The less you know, the better.

07:47.143 --> 07:49.011
What, do you think
the Head of Records is

07:49.012 --> 07:51.013
gonna tie me to a chair
down at City Hall

07:51.014 --> 07:53.215
and blind me with some bright light?

07:53.216 --> 07:55.083
You're reading too many spy novels.

07:55.084 --> 07:57.586
No, I just don't want you
losing your new job is all.

07:57.587 --> 07:59.621
No one's gonna notice
if I check a name for you.

07:59.622 --> 08:02.790
- What would I do without you?
- You'd be lost.

08:05.427 --> 08:08.797
Honestly, a little sneaking
around livens up the file room

08:08.798 --> 08:11.300
a little bit. Besides,

08:11.301 --> 08:13.802
I wouldn't mind a little cloak
and dagger lifestyle

08:13.803 --> 08:15.137
you lead, Miss Trudy Clarke.

08:16.773 --> 08:18.907
You wanna cheat at Mahjong,

08:18.908 --> 08:21.043
you find another joint to play in.

08:21.044 --> 08:23.011
- Wendy, you need help?
- Nope. I'm good.

08:29.518 --> 08:31.753
Honestly, sometimes,

08:31.754 --> 08:34.089
I just hope for a simpler life.

08:34.090 --> 08:36.224
Nah. I don't buy it.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.592
You ladies live for the excitement.

08:38.594 --> 08:40.595
No. I hear you, Wendy.

08:40.596 --> 08:42.631
There's some nights
the only thing I really want

08:42.631 --> 08:45.699
is some nice music playing and
strong arm wrapped around me.

08:47.703 --> 08:50.237
Think your girl is dropping
you a big hint, Bill.

08:51.773 --> 08:56.578
Well, I should get back
to work or I'll lose my job.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.047
City Records will
fall apart without me.

08:59.048 --> 09:00.648
I'll be seeing you soon.

09:03.318 --> 09:04.585
I'll get you a drink.

09:10.058 --> 09:12.961
- Good, you're alone.
- What's going on?

09:12.962 --> 09:15.197
- You tell me.
- What is that supposed to mean?

09:15.198 --> 09:17.865
There is a lot riding on this urn.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.634
10000 clams to be precise.

09:21.670 --> 09:23.290
I wouldn't rush to write that cheque.

09:24.806 --> 09:26.308
All right, Frankie.
Come on, spill the beans.

09:26.309 --> 09:27.876
What do you know about Marian Hartley?

09:27.877 --> 09:29.678
I already told you. She's a fraud.

09:29.679 --> 09:30.879
Wrong.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.148
The museum curator has
already verified the urn.

09:33.149 --> 09:35.317
You know, expert eye,
testing, the whole shebang.

09:35.318 --> 09:37.419
- It's the real McCoy.
- Good.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.320
Great.

09:40.756 --> 09:43.256
- What are you not telling me?
- You'll find out on your own.

09:44.159 --> 09:45.679
Something happened
in Egypt, didn't it?

09:47.163 --> 09:50.431
You're stubborn as a mule,
just like your old man.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.168
So, tell me where you met her.

09:53.169 --> 09:55.470
The Windsor. Just before the war.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.839
- The palace?
- It was a drinking hole

09:57.840 --> 10:00.108
- in the back streets of Cairo.
- That sounds like fun.

10:00.109 --> 10:02.644
Marian ran the place.
She liked to booze people up

10:02.645 --> 10:04.745
- and get them talking.
- Including you.

10:05.981 --> 10:09.317
And now she's passing off
some story about you

10:09.318 --> 10:11.386
and Howard Carter
as her own, and it's got

10:11.387 --> 10:13.355
your nose all out of joint,
doesn't it, baby?

10:13.356 --> 10:15.891
Let's just say it's not only stories

10:15.892 --> 10:17.592
she likes to pass off as her own.

10:17.593 --> 10:19.361
What, you saying the urn isn't hers?

10:19.362 --> 10:21.930
What I'm saying is
you should be careful,

10:21.931 --> 10:23.365
because she's pulling one over on you.

10:23.366 --> 10:26.868
On me?

10:26.869 --> 10:28.770
Sweetie.

10:28.771 --> 10:30.272
Give your mother
just a little bit of credit.

10:30.273 --> 10:31.840
She wasn't born yesterday.

10:31.841 --> 10:33.108
Really?

10:33.109 --> 10:35.444
For your information,
I've persuaded the ROM

10:35.445 --> 10:37.446
to engage
a world-renowned authenticator

10:37.447 --> 10:39.247
to look into the provenince...

10:39.248 --> 10:43.151
- Provenance.
- Provenance of the urn,

10:43.152 --> 10:45.454
as in, where did it come from.
And if it was stolen,

10:45.455 --> 10:47.556
- he's gonna figure that out.
- What's his name?

10:47.557 --> 10:50.392
Michael Walsh.
He's like the... head honcho

10:50.393 --> 10:53.128
at the Field Museum in Chicago.
And I'm making a big splash

10:53.129 --> 10:55.831
about it too. Big splash! I am putting

10:55.832 --> 10:57.399
the ROM on the map.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.401
What do you need me for?
Sounds like you have it

10:59.402 --> 11:01.536
- all covered.
- Well, I do.

11:01.537 --> 11:04.371
- Fine.
- Fine.

11:16.685 --> 11:19.153
What happens if we can't
identify this dead man?

11:20.455 --> 11:22.424
His wife is never gonna know
what happened to him.

11:22.425 --> 11:24.426
And the unsolved mystery is

11:24.427 --> 11:26.060
gonna haunt her forever.

11:33.468 --> 11:35.737
Flo...

11:35.738 --> 11:38.773
I'm sorry.
I mean, I'm such a nitwit.

11:38.774 --> 11:41.309
Of course... of course you don't
know what happened

11:41.310 --> 11:42.611
to your husband during the war.

11:42.612 --> 11:44.246
I mean, how he died. Flo.

11:44.247 --> 11:46.114
- I am so sorry.
- It's all right, Mary.

11:46.115 --> 11:47.649
That's why I don't want any woman

11:47.650 --> 11:49.084
to go through what I went through.

11:49.085 --> 11:51.518
I don't even know
where Herb is buried.

11:54.322 --> 11:57.091
Flo, I really admire
how you cope with tragedy.

11:58.026 --> 12:00.128
Well, wallowing won't bring Herb back.

12:00.129 --> 12:02.731
And I've got my job. At least for now.

12:02.732 --> 12:05.899
The Coroner gets a whiff
of this, I'm out on my ear.

12:06.835 --> 12:08.870
I should think the Coroner would

12:08.871 --> 12:12.240
admire this noble work.
You're trying to identify

12:12.241 --> 12:15.110
an unidentified body.

12:15.111 --> 12:19.514
- And on your spare time, too.
- Fat chance.

12:19.515 --> 12:21.283
Dig faster.

12:21.284 --> 12:24.151
Graveyards... creepy.

12:31.227 --> 12:33.261
Hi.

12:33.262 --> 12:35.896
You don't smoke that thing
very often. Nora?

12:36.965 --> 12:38.733
We had a difference of opinion.

12:38.734 --> 12:41.169
I saw her get into a taxi.

12:41.170 --> 12:44.039
She seems pretty worked up
about this exhibit.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.675
Muttering something about
that urn and a Marian Hartley.

12:46.676 --> 12:50.178
Yes. An old acquaintance
from my Cairo days.

12:50.179 --> 12:52.012
Ooh. Seems there's a story there.

12:53.281 --> 12:55.884
She stole something from this
young boy who had nothing.

12:55.885 --> 12:58.086
I mean, who does that? Even Nora
wouldn't stoop that low.

12:58.087 --> 13:01.656
- What was it?
- It was an ancient amulet.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.858
It was in this boy's family
for generations,

13:03.859 --> 13:05.493
and Marian sold it off as her own.

13:05.494 --> 13:08.096
Let me guess. Frankie Drake,

13:08.097 --> 13:09.864
champion of the underdog, stopped her.

13:09.865 --> 13:12.834
I tried. I made a real stink.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.003
Marian must've been thrilled.

13:15.004 --> 13:19.341
She was furious...
but I couldn't prove it.

13:19.342 --> 13:21.276
So she won.

13:21.277 --> 13:23.111
Bet that ticked you off.

13:23.112 --> 13:24.778
You could say that.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.749
So, you think she's pulling
the same stunt at the ROM?

13:27.750 --> 13:29.217
Well, she's done it before.

13:29.218 --> 13:31.119
Maybe we should see what she's up to.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.222
- What's she selling?
- It's an Incan urn.

13:34.223 --> 13:36.057
Well, let me see what I can find

13:36.058 --> 13:37.993
- about stolen Peruvian artifacts.
- OK. Good.

13:37.994 --> 13:39.461
What about Bill? Did he have any luck

13:39.462 --> 13:41.596
- finding the Parkes family?
- It's a dead end.

13:41.597 --> 13:44.164
There's no record on Jack Parkes
or his brother Ronald.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.435
Something's going on.

13:47.436 --> 13:49.370
What has Flo's stumbled into?

13:51.206 --> 13:52.741
Flo! You've got it!

13:55.510 --> 13:57.145
Is he, um... all right?

13:57.146 --> 13:59.446
He's still dead,
if that's what you mean.

14:00.615 --> 14:02.250
Well, don't forget
the fingerprints so we can

14:02.251 --> 14:04.118
fill in the grave and get out of here.

14:07.956 --> 14:10.557
- Stranger and stranger.
- What does that mean?

14:11.793 --> 14:13.795
The new part of his nail,
it's discoloured.

14:13.796 --> 14:15.764
Fingernails grow after death?

14:15.765 --> 14:17.832
No, not exactly.
It just looks that way.

14:17.833 --> 14:19.467
They dehydrate and it retracts,

14:19.468 --> 14:21.536
- exposing the nail bed.
- Right...

14:21.537 --> 14:23.171
Wow, you really know a lot about this.

14:23.172 --> 14:25.840
10 years of night school
eventually pays off.

14:25.841 --> 14:29.444
Um... well, then, what does
the discoloration mean?

14:29.445 --> 14:32.514
- Poison.
- What?

14:32.515 --> 14:35.435
Our mystery man was murdered.

14:45.556 --> 14:46.600
Were you followed?

14:46.601 --> 14:48.201
No. Why the secrecy?

14:48.202 --> 14:50.022
Keep your voice down.
I could lose my job.

14:53.707 --> 14:56.776
Ahem. Our mystery man.

14:56.777 --> 14:59.045
- You dug up the body?
- With difficulty.

14:59.046 --> 15:01.481
- And a wheelbarrow.
- I'm impressed.

15:01.482 --> 15:02.983
We didn't have a choice.
You are never gonna

15:02.984 --> 15:04.751
- believe this, Frankie...
- He was murdered.

15:04.752 --> 15:06.486
I thought he died of a heart attack.

15:06.487 --> 15:08.755
He did. Likely brought on by poison.

15:08.756 --> 15:12.259
My best guess is a massive dose
of thallium-laced rat poison.

15:12.260 --> 15:15.095
Undetectable. The telltale sign
only showed up

15:15.096 --> 15:17.597
- on his fingernails post mortem.
- But who killed him?

15:17.598 --> 15:20.233
Could have been the man who
posed as the victim's brother.

15:20.234 --> 15:21.868
- Could be.
- I got a good look at him.

15:21.869 --> 15:23.670
I mean, I could try to identify him

15:23.671 --> 15:25.005
but without a name
or an address to go on,

15:25.006 --> 15:26.806
it's like finding
a needle in a haystack.

15:26.807 --> 15:28.708
The best way to find
our killer is to figure out

15:28.709 --> 15:30.277
who this dead man really is.

15:30.278 --> 15:32.245
Well, maybe he had a criminal record.

15:32.246 --> 15:33.747
I could check his fingerprints.

15:33.748 --> 15:36.283
We've gotta work fast.
We're lucky it's Saturday.

15:36.284 --> 15:38.051
The coroner never shows up
on the weekends,

15:38.052 --> 15:40.287
unless it's an emergency.
Make sure no one spots you!

15:40.288 --> 15:41.520
I go... got it!

15:42.956 --> 15:45.025
This birthmark could be useful.

15:45.026 --> 15:47.193
And check out this unusual scarring

15:47.194 --> 15:49.294
on his abdomen that was
noted by the coroner.

15:50.230 --> 15:51.998
- Intriguing.
- It's not an injury.

15:51.999 --> 15:53.934
- No.
- Could it be a surgery?

15:53.935 --> 15:56.403
Not recent. I'll do some research.

15:56.404 --> 15:57.603
OK.

16:09.416 --> 16:11.318
Officer Shaw.

16:11.319 --> 16:13.919
Detective Greyson.
What are you doing here?

16:15.622 --> 16:16.955
What are you doing?

16:17.857 --> 16:19.826
I'm...

16:19.827 --> 16:22.362
just taking some time
to educate myself.

16:22.363 --> 16:23.964
Should I,
in the line of duty, have cause

16:23.965 --> 16:26.499
to take a fingerprint or two,
I would like to be prepared.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.602
A morality officer
taking fingerprints.

16:28.603 --> 16:30.303
That's really something.

16:30.304 --> 16:32.771
And I think I'm actually
getting quite good at it.

16:34.574 --> 16:36.843
I see.

16:36.844 --> 16:38.977
- It always helps to practice.
- Yes.

16:40.714 --> 16:43.049
Well, Officer Shaw,
I commend your initiative.

16:43.050 --> 16:45.218
Detective, that's...

16:45.219 --> 16:47.520
- Thank you.
- There is one more thing.

16:50.156 --> 16:51.957
Of course.

16:53.193 --> 16:55.094
Thank you.

16:57.597 --> 16:59.766
So, I looked into
the Peruvian artifacts.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.468
A lot of Incan stuff was unearthed

17:01.469 --> 17:03.336
when the lost city
of Machu Picchu was discovered

17:03.337 --> 17:06.606
- by some Yale professor.
- One Hiram Bingham III.

17:06.607 --> 17:08.074
- You know him?
- I don't,

17:08.075 --> 17:10.343
but Marian claims to have
worked with him in Peru.

17:10.344 --> 17:13.012
Well, it seems Bingham's
excavation was pretty extensive.

17:13.013 --> 17:15.615
There were hundreds of workers
and Thousands of artifacts

17:15.616 --> 17:17.250
that were uncovered.
Who knows what happened

17:17.251 --> 17:18.652
to them or how many were pilfered?

17:18.653 --> 17:21.755
- The Wild West of archeology.
- You got it.

17:21.756 --> 17:23.189
Just me.

17:23.190 --> 17:24.590
Hello, Nora.

17:24.592 --> 17:26.859
No time for a drink
but thanks for asking.

17:26.861 --> 17:29.796
Listen, much as it pains me
to say this, I need your help.

17:29.797 --> 17:31.630
- We're busy.
- Don't make me beg.

17:32.899 --> 17:34.534
- What's up?
- There was a break-in

17:34.535 --> 17:36.403
- last night at the museum.
- So call the cops.

17:36.404 --> 17:38.104
Well, they were called!
They took their time arriving,

17:38.105 --> 17:40.507
- missed the intruder.
- What was stolen?

17:40.508 --> 17:41.875
Well, see, that's the thing.

17:41.876 --> 17:43.810
Those oafs they call constables
swarm all over the place,

17:43.811 --> 17:45.879
- can't find anything missing.
- Nothing?

17:45.880 --> 17:47.947
Yeah, I don't buy it.
I mean, Who breaks into

17:47.948 --> 17:50.016
the Royal Ontario Museum
and doesn't steal anything,

17:50.017 --> 17:52.185
all those priceless things
just lying around,

17:52.186 --> 17:54.354
begging to be taken? Something's up

17:54.355 --> 17:55.388
and I want to know what.

17:55.389 --> 17:56.656
Well, what do you want us to do?

17:56.657 --> 17:58.458
I want you to figure out
what the cops missed!

17:58.459 --> 18:00.279
You're still private detectives,
aren't you?

18:01.695 --> 18:04.998
OK. What's the retainer?

18:04.999 --> 18:07.300
No. I am not kidding.

18:07.301 --> 18:09.402
Going legit is no picnic.
And my reputation

18:09.403 --> 18:10.904
is at stake with this urn.

18:10.905 --> 18:13.206
Nothing can go sideways.

18:14.909 --> 18:16.275
You in?

18:20.747 --> 18:23.416
This lock was
the only one tampered with.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.437
They must want something in this room.

18:29.756 --> 18:31.324
If it was our beautiful urn,

18:31.325 --> 18:34.627
Mrs. Amory was ahead
of the thief. She insisted

18:34.628 --> 18:37.296
on installing this secure cabinet.

18:49.576 --> 18:51.511
Completely burglar proof.

18:51.512 --> 18:53.312
Seems that way.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.215
This is the list of our inventory.

18:57.117 --> 18:58.418
I'll check it out.

18:58.419 --> 19:00.385
I'm gonna have a chat
with an old friend.

19:04.824 --> 19:07.160
That new Detective Greyson,
for a moment,

19:07.161 --> 19:08.695
I thought he was
going to be different,

19:08.696 --> 19:10.130
that he was going
to take me seriously,

19:10.131 --> 19:12.398
but it turns out
he's just like all the rest.

19:12.399 --> 19:14.267
He has no respect
for my policing talents.

19:14.268 --> 19:15.869
- Did you find out anything?
- Well...

19:15.870 --> 19:17.904
There's the real frustration,
Flo. I checked

19:17.905 --> 19:19.939
every fingerprint.
Whoever this mystery man is,

19:19.940 --> 19:21.875
he's got no record.
And there was no luck

19:21.876 --> 19:24.409
- on the phantom brother either.
- Mary. Look at this.

19:26.813 --> 19:28.782
Flo! These are the same
incisions as on the body.

19:28.783 --> 19:32.118
Exactly. I think our victim
had an organoscopy.

19:32.119 --> 19:33.586
That sounds unpleasant.

19:33.587 --> 19:35.588
It's a revolutionary
surgical technique.

19:35.589 --> 19:37.557
Pioneered by a Dr. Bertram Bernheim

19:37.558 --> 19:40.260
- at Johns Hopkins University.
- So, if our victim was

19:40.261 --> 19:42.862
one of his patients,
maybe they can identify him.

19:42.863 --> 19:44.898
Has he got any particular
identifying features?

19:44.899 --> 19:46.932
A birthmark on his left shoulder. Why?

19:48.668 --> 19:51.008
Perhaps I can put my policing
talents to use after all.

19:55.508 --> 19:58.278
Your ongoing patronage is
very appreciated.

19:58.279 --> 20:00.280
I look forward
to seeing you next time.

20:00.281 --> 20:02.248
You're back.

20:02.249 --> 20:03.850
I'm here to investigate

20:03.851 --> 20:06.085
- last night's break-in.
- Well. Why you?

20:06.086 --> 20:07.954
Because I'm a private detective.

20:07.955 --> 20:09.622
Private detective?

20:09.623 --> 20:12.292
That's quite a step down
from archeology to snooping.

20:12.293 --> 20:14.460
Well, at least I've
been an archeologist,

20:14.461 --> 20:16.296
- unlike some.
- Meaning?

20:16.297 --> 20:18.131
You were nowhere near
the Valley of the Kings.

20:18.132 --> 20:19.933
And the overnight train to Marseilles,

20:19.934 --> 20:22.068
- I told you that story.
- I'm sure Howard Carter

20:22.069 --> 20:23.937
took lots of trains
and met lots of young women.

20:23.938 --> 20:26.005
Well, impress your camp
followers all you want

20:26.006 --> 20:27.941
with my stories. I'm only interested

20:27.942 --> 20:30.310
- in where you were last night.
- Last night?

20:30.311 --> 20:32.779
Here and there,
being entertained by patrons

20:32.780 --> 20:34.948
- of this fine institution.
- I'm sure you were doing

20:34.949 --> 20:37.050
- most of the entertaining.
- I don't understand

20:37.051 --> 20:39.018
why you're being so hostile, Frankie.

20:39.019 --> 20:40.987
You and I go way back,
and how many people can

20:40.988 --> 20:43.056
say that these days? Remember the fun

20:43.057 --> 20:45.124
- we used to have at The Windsor?
- Did we?

20:45.125 --> 20:49.229
Come on! You remember
Lawrence, when he came in

20:49.230 --> 20:50.930
dressed as a Bedouin demanding a drink

20:50.931 --> 20:53.199
- in that charming English accent.
- No, I don't.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.968
But I do remember
the scam that you pulled.

20:54.969 --> 20:56.903
That's ancient history.

20:56.904 --> 20:59.372
Not to Asim, it's not. You do
remember him, don't you?

20:59.373 --> 21:01.841
- The amulet was mine.
- After his mother died,

21:01.842 --> 21:04.077
the amulet was all he had
to remember her by.

21:04.078 --> 21:06.246
You stole from a child.

21:06.247 --> 21:09.349
It was verified
as my archeological find.

21:09.350 --> 21:12.619
- Just like the urn?
- Nora Amory's only bringing in

21:12.620 --> 21:15.288
some other authenticator
to drum up publicity

21:15.289 --> 21:17.590
- for this backwater pile.
- A backwater that's about

21:17.591 --> 21:19.992
to pay you 10 grand for some
fraud that you're pulling.

21:21.194 --> 21:23.863
You've got it all figured out,
Miss PI.

21:23.864 --> 21:27.766
Not yet... but I will.

21:32.505 --> 21:35.708
Doctor Bernheim, thank you
so much for speaking with me.

21:35.709 --> 21:37.677
Um, I'm calling on behalf

21:37.678 --> 21:39.978
of Detective Greyson
of the Toronto Police.

21:41.147 --> 21:44.951
The police, the Po... lice. Yes.

21:44.952 --> 21:48.154
Um, we need your help
identifying a corpse.

21:48.155 --> 21:50.556
A corpse.

21:50.557 --> 21:52.792
A body. Right.

21:52.793 --> 21:55.461
We know he was
a patient at Johns Hopkins,

21:55.462 --> 21:59.532
and we believe he had an
organoscopy some time ago.

21:59.533 --> 22:03.603
Right. So, if you would kindly
check your records,

22:03.604 --> 22:05.305
and... you would?

22:05.306 --> 22:06.706
That would be most helpful.

22:06.707 --> 22:10.109
And, and, and
he has a distinctive birthmark

22:10.110 --> 22:13.680
on his left shoulder... Right.
That, that would...

22:13.681 --> 22:15.781
Yes, absolutely, I can wait.

22:17.050 --> 22:18.351
See this?

22:18.352 --> 22:21.621
Boy, that gal can
sure write a headline?

22:21.622 --> 22:23.656
Yeah. Seems you've got
a fan in Lipstick.

22:23.657 --> 22:25.591
Don't I just. I got
all the press clamouring

22:25.592 --> 22:27.860
for this story. Now if the guest
of honour would just show up...

22:27.861 --> 22:30.129
Right. Michael Walsh is
on the slow boat to Toronto.

22:30.130 --> 22:32.332
Yeah, you're telling me.
He left Chicago days ago.

22:32.333 --> 22:35.233
This is the last item
in the collection.

22:36.235 --> 22:37.503
That's it. Everything checks out.

22:37.504 --> 22:39.137
You are kidding me!

22:42.809 --> 22:44.410
Sorry.

22:44.411 --> 22:46.446
I hate to say it,
but the cops were right.

22:46.447 --> 22:47.981
Nothing's missing.

22:47.982 --> 22:49.749
So, why did Marian break in?

22:49.750 --> 22:52.318
- You don't know it was her.
- A break-in at the ROM

22:52.319 --> 22:54.620
with Marian in town is
not a coincidence.

22:54.621 --> 22:55.989
That's funny.

22:55.990 --> 22:58.558
Nora's has a pretty good nose
and she couldn't smell anything.

22:58.559 --> 23:01.227
- How come she didn't make Marian?
- Because she didn't want to.

23:01.228 --> 23:03.696
- She has too much invested.
- Seems like you're

23:03.697 --> 23:05.999
- pretty invested yourself.
- What's that supposed to mean?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.234
Marian's gotten under your skin.

23:08.235 --> 23:10.770
Cairo was years ago, Frankie.
You can't fix the past.

23:10.771 --> 23:12.805
- I'm not trying to.
- Really?

23:12.806 --> 23:15.441
Fine... but it doesn't mean

23:15.442 --> 23:17.076
that I'm not right.

23:17.077 --> 23:18.344
Yeah, well, there's
a first for everything.

23:18.345 --> 23:20.405
Hello?!

23:22.248 --> 23:24.851
I've got it! I have got it.

23:24.852 --> 23:28.054
- Got what?
- Well, Flo actually cracked it.

23:28.055 --> 23:29.655
He was a patient at Johns Hopkins.

23:29.656 --> 23:31.791
- Who was?
- The man in Flo's fridge.

23:31.792 --> 23:35.528
He's got a name. It is Michael Walsh.

23:35.529 --> 23:37.630
Michael Walsh.
That's the elusive authenticator

23:37.631 --> 23:39.899
- from Chicago.
- So, our two investigations

23:39.900 --> 23:41.601
- are one and the same.
- But who would want to kill

23:41.602 --> 23:43.669
- an antiquities expert?
- Looks like Frankie's got

23:43.670 --> 23:46.472
- her number one suspect.
- Really? Who is it, Frankie?

23:46.473 --> 23:48.408
I need to send a telegram,

23:48.409 --> 23:49.876
and then catch a train.

23:59.517 --> 24:01.785
Come in.

24:01.786 --> 24:05.255
Hiram Bingham III, I presume?

24:05.256 --> 24:07.189
No, call me Bingham.

24:08.458 --> 24:11.828
- You must be Frankie Drake.
- Thank you for meeting with me.

24:11.829 --> 24:15.732
Howard Carter's telegram
was some introduction.

24:15.733 --> 24:17.433
You made quite an impression.

24:19.369 --> 24:20.670
I can see why.

24:23.273 --> 24:24.775
So, how did you like Egypt?

24:30.714 --> 24:33.215
So, Miss Drake, how can I help?

24:34.351 --> 24:37.053
I'm looking for something
old and Peruvian.

24:38.422 --> 24:40.991
This Incan urn.

24:45.062 --> 24:46.630
It's very nice.

24:46.631 --> 24:48.765
I'd say this is quite a find.

24:48.766 --> 24:50.767
Would you say it's authentic?

24:50.768 --> 24:53.003
I can't be sure from this photo.

24:53.004 --> 24:54.338
I'd have to examine the real thing.

24:54.339 --> 24:56.573
- Have you seen it before?
- No.

24:56.574 --> 24:59.643
- No, were you digging in Peru?
- I wasn't.

24:59.644 --> 25:02.779
She was. Marian Hartley.

25:02.780 --> 25:05.381
- Do you recognize her?
- Should I?

25:06.650 --> 25:09.051
She claims she was working
with you in Machu Picchu.

25:10.520 --> 25:13.123
Marian Hartley...

25:13.124 --> 25:14.625
Are you sure you have the right name?

25:14.626 --> 25:17.093
Yes, I'm very sure.

25:18.328 --> 25:21.365
- She didn't work with you.
- I've never heard of her.

25:21.366 --> 25:23.332
Why are you asking?

25:24.334 --> 25:26.169
It's a long story.

25:26.170 --> 25:28.071
Thank you for your help,

25:28.072 --> 25:30.140
but I have a train to catch.

25:30.141 --> 25:31.642
Must you rush off?

25:31.643 --> 25:33.776
I'd be happy to drive you
to the station.

25:34.678 --> 25:36.446
In the meantime...

25:36.447 --> 25:37.614
I happen to have a bottle

25:37.615 --> 25:39.582
of your Canadian whiskey tucked away.

25:40.484 --> 25:41.951
Well, I'm more of a gin gal.

25:43.487 --> 25:45.755
But... I could make an exception.

25:46.790 --> 25:48.090
There you go.

25:51.328 --> 25:53.163
So, is this what
brought you to Buffalo?

25:53.164 --> 25:55.132
Yes, actually.

25:55.133 --> 25:57.266
I'm on a treasure hunt.

25:58.802 --> 26:00.070
Incan gold.

26:00.071 --> 26:03.407
Supposedly hidden from
the conquistadors centuries ago.

26:03.408 --> 26:05.708
You're looking for clues?

26:07.010 --> 26:08.712
According to myth,

26:08.713 --> 26:11.113
a secret map to the treasure exists.

26:12.449 --> 26:13.949
You think it's woven into this?

26:14.985 --> 26:17.120
- I was optimistic.
- But disappointed.

26:18.756 --> 26:21.591
The real map is said to bear

26:21.592 --> 26:24.026
this Incan spider symbol.

26:25.329 --> 26:28.264
Sadly, this tapestry has no such mark.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.040
And you think this treasure's real?

26:32.936 --> 26:34.604
I'm an adventurer.

26:34.605 --> 26:37.541
We thrive on the possibility
of the impossible.

26:37.542 --> 26:40.143
And the thrill's in the chase.

26:40.144 --> 26:42.378
A woman after my own heart.

26:50.821 --> 26:52.422
- What's up?
- We got a problem.

26:52.423 --> 26:54.991
There's been a traffic accident
with a couple of fatalities,

26:54.992 --> 26:57.260
and the bodies are
on their way here now.

26:57.261 --> 26:58.962
We've gotta get rid
of Mr. Walsh pronto.

26:58.963 --> 27:00.197
Right. I have a friend from church

27:00.198 --> 27:01.665
who works for
the Bethany Funeral Home.

27:01.666 --> 27:03.900
- I could talk to her.
- I can hold the coroner off

27:03.901 --> 27:05.635
for an hour or so.
Your friend, she's discreet?

27:05.636 --> 27:07.537
Yeah, no doubt about it.

27:07.538 --> 27:09.973
I mean, Walsh will be the only
white body in the place,

27:09.974 --> 27:11.641
but at least he can lay in rest
'til we find his wife.

27:11.642 --> 27:13.877
- OK. Help me dress him.
- What?

27:13.878 --> 27:15.812
It's quicker with two. Grab an apron.

27:25.822 --> 27:27.924
- Hello again.
- What do you want now?

27:27.925 --> 27:30.026
Well, I just spent
a very pleasant evening

27:30.027 --> 27:32.529
with an old friend of yours,
Hiram Bingham III.

27:32.530 --> 27:34.865
Well, he isn't in Toronto.

27:34.866 --> 27:36.400
No, he isn't. He's in Buffalo.

27:36.401 --> 27:38.101
But we had a very interesting
chat about you.

27:38.102 --> 27:40.137
You weren't in Machu Picchu

27:40.138 --> 27:41.505
- with him.
- Don't be ridiculous.

27:41.506 --> 27:43.907
- Where did you get the urn?
- Give it up, Frankie.

27:43.908 --> 27:45.509
You lost before,
and you'll lose again.

27:45.510 --> 27:47.477
Not this time, I'm afraid.

27:47.478 --> 27:48.845
Where were you four nights ago?

27:48.846 --> 27:52.015
Why the sudden interest
in my social schedule?

27:52.016 --> 27:54.049
Call it curiosity.

27:55.986 --> 27:57.521
Four nights ago...

27:57.522 --> 27:59.989
that was the evening
before my presentation.

28:02.426 --> 28:04.827
Why don't you ask Nora Amory?

28:05.796 --> 28:07.396
I will.

28:10.500 --> 28:11.968
OK, you are absolutely sure?

28:11.969 --> 28:13.670
Well, like, I had the filet mignon,

28:13.671 --> 28:15.038
Marian had the lobster. I mean, it was

28:15.039 --> 28:17.140
a charming evening
on the museum's tab.

28:17.141 --> 28:18.942
- Why are you asking?
- Because Marian is a killer!

28:18.943 --> 28:20.644
- At least I thought she was.
- Well, that's a little

28:20.645 --> 28:23.513
dramatic, darling, even for you.
Who did she supposedly kill?

28:23.514 --> 28:25.215
Michael Walsh, the authenticator.

28:25.216 --> 28:27.317
You're kidding. He's dead?

28:27.318 --> 28:29.052
- I'm afraid so.
- Well, no wonder

28:29.053 --> 28:30.554
- he didn't show up.
- Yeah, well, somebody

28:30.555 --> 28:32.389
killed him and went to a lot
of trouble to hide his body.

28:32.390 --> 28:34.157
Why do you think it was
Marian? I mean, she's got

28:34.158 --> 28:36.092
no reason to kill him.
The museum curator has

28:36.093 --> 28:37.828
already confirmed the urn's genuine.

28:37.829 --> 28:39.129
Yeah, well, I still don't buy it.

28:39.130 --> 28:40.664
Yeah, well,
four nights ago, Marian was

28:40.665 --> 28:43.133
sucking on a crustacean,
not bumping off Walsh.

28:43.134 --> 28:45.135
Can you keep Walsh's demise quiet

28:45.136 --> 28:46.770
- for a day or two?
- Yeah. He's dead.

28:46.771 --> 28:49.139
- I don't expect he'll mind. Why?
- I just need some time

28:49.140 --> 28:51.941
- to figure this out.
- OK. Go, go, go, go.

29:43.593 --> 29:45.829
Just me.

29:45.830 --> 29:47.397
I wanted to let you know
that Michael Walsh

29:47.398 --> 29:49.599
is safely tucked away
at the Bethany Funeral Home.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.902
- Trudy came through.
- Yep, and I found

29:51.903 --> 29:53.670
a way to reach his wife,
Ingrid, with the news.

29:53.671 --> 29:56.072
Which won't be an easy call,
given that he was murdered.

29:56.073 --> 29:58.441
You might wanna hold off
on making that call.

29:58.442 --> 30:00.810
- Why?
- I may have a lead

30:00.811 --> 30:02.811
- on who the killer is.
- You do?

30:04.948 --> 30:06.650
This guy.

30:06.651 --> 30:08.618
Holy cats, you found him!

30:08.619 --> 30:10.587
You know who he is?

30:10.588 --> 30:13.256
That's the man who came
to identify his dead brother!

30:13.257 --> 30:14.291
That's Ronald Parkes!

30:14.292 --> 30:16.326
That's my brother.

30:16.327 --> 30:18.795
My condolences, Mr. Parkes.

30:18.796 --> 30:22.632
So, so, Marian's friend
Ronald killed Michael Walsh?

30:22.633 --> 30:26.102
But if Ronald is the killer,
why show up at the morgue

30:26.103 --> 30:28.038
- and risk getting caught?
- Because he wanted to make

30:28.039 --> 30:30.173
very sure that if anyone came
looking for Walsh,

30:30.174 --> 30:31.608
- he was never found.
- Like his wife.

30:31.609 --> 30:33.643
- Exactly.
- Except for I found

30:33.644 --> 30:35.645
- that wedding ring.
- And unraveled the plan.

30:35.646 --> 30:38.448
Why go to all that trouble to
make sure Walsh was never found?

30:38.449 --> 30:41.851
Because Ronald is planning
to steal Walsh's identity.

30:41.852 --> 30:43.186
What for?

30:43.187 --> 30:46.889
A very valuable urn
at the Royal Ontario Museum.

30:50.393 --> 30:53.964
Michael Walsh from
the Field Museum in Chicago.

30:53.965 --> 30:55.999
I am delighted
to meet you, Mrs. Amory.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.868
Mr. Walsh. Hello!

30:58.869 --> 31:00.670
We were beginning to think

31:00.671 --> 31:03.506
- you'd never arrive.
- An invitation to examine

31:03.507 --> 31:06.409
an early piece of Incan pottery,
how could I resist?

31:06.410 --> 31:08.345
- I am very keen to see it.
- I bet you are.

31:08.346 --> 31:10.347
Please...

31:25.226 --> 31:27.527
Michael Walsh,
a.k.a. the walking dead,

31:27.528 --> 31:30.764
just strolled into the ROM.
What is going on?!

31:30.765 --> 31:32.565
He certainly took his time.

31:32.566 --> 31:34.434
You knew, and you didn't
think to tell your mother!

31:34.435 --> 31:35.735
I'm still trying to figure it out!

31:35.736 --> 31:37.337
Well hurry up. Being left in the dark

31:37.338 --> 31:39.272
makes me very uncomfortable!

31:39.273 --> 31:41.541
Frankie, I am used to running the con,

31:41.542 --> 31:43.743
- not being the mark.
- The man that you just saw,

31:43.744 --> 31:45.645
he killed the real Michael Walsh.

31:45.646 --> 31:48.581
Charming fellow!
What is he doing at the museum?

31:48.582 --> 31:51.918
I don't know, but he has a partner.

31:51.919 --> 31:53.720
If it isn't
Miss Hartley from Cairo!

31:53.721 --> 31:56.122
- The one and only.
- You're not gonna gloat?

31:56.123 --> 31:57.891
No time for that.

31:57.892 --> 32:00.293
What are they after?
It, well, it has to be the urn.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.314
- That's what I've been saying.
- Now she gloats.

32:03.530 --> 32:07.167
- They're after the 10 grand.
- So they sell the ROM a fake.

32:07.168 --> 32:09.936
- Except the urn's a genuine.
- So why bother

32:09.937 --> 32:12.672
- impersonating the authenticator?
- It's a classic!

32:12.673 --> 32:15.909
- It's the old switcheroo.
- Clearly a favourite of yours.

32:15.910 --> 32:18.377
Well, I, I, you know, I, I may
have run it once or twice.

32:19.712 --> 32:22.215
You find yourself a mark.
You offer the genuine article

32:22.216 --> 32:24.417
for sale. The buyer agrees,
you set a price,

32:24.418 --> 32:25.852
you collect the cash,
and then you switch

32:25.853 --> 32:28.555
the genuine article for a fake.
And the beauty of it is.

32:28.556 --> 32:30.590
- No one's the wiser.
- And then you pull

32:30.591 --> 32:33.226
- the same con somewhere else.
- Exactly.

32:33.227 --> 32:34.660
So, how does the switch work?

32:35.895 --> 32:39.031
Trade secret. What?
I'm saving it for my memoirs.

32:40.066 --> 32:42.435
The question is how are
Marian and pal gonna

32:42.436 --> 32:43.969
pull it off at the ROM?

32:44.904 --> 32:46.306
The mysterious break-in.

32:46.307 --> 32:49.242
Where nothing was taken.
Ronald broke in...

32:49.243 --> 32:51.911
And he planted a replica.
But Trudy searched the place.

32:51.912 --> 32:54.113
- She didn't find anything.
- Yeah, but she was looking

32:54.114 --> 32:56.316
- for something missing.
- Not something hidden.

32:56.317 --> 32:58.717
Well, there's only one way
to catch them.

32:59.652 --> 33:01.554
We let it play out.

33:01.555 --> 33:04.424
OK, so when is Walsh
authenticating the urn?

33:04.425 --> 33:06.024
This afternoon.

33:08.628 --> 33:11.231
- Old times, Frankie.
- Don't push it.

33:11.232 --> 33:12.831
OK.

33:20.773 --> 33:22.175
Operator?

33:22.176 --> 33:24.043
Chicago, please.

33:24.044 --> 33:26.880
The Field Museum.

33:26.881 --> 33:29.549
Well, yes, the urn is
a coveted treasure,

33:29.550 --> 33:31.618
but so too is Miss Hartley,

33:31.619 --> 33:34.621
who has been delighting us
with her tales of adventure.

33:34.622 --> 33:37.624
I envy your travels to Machu Picchu,

33:37.625 --> 33:39.158
- Miss Hartley.
- Yes, Machu Picchu!

33:39.159 --> 33:41.828
Words cannot describe the experience

33:41.829 --> 33:45.064
of entering the lost city.
One's senses are

33:45.065 --> 33:47.066
completely taken over.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.635
It's truly like

33:48.636 --> 33:50.869
holding history in your hands.

33:52.238 --> 33:54.840
- Intoxicating.
- Completely.

33:56.209 --> 33:59.178
I can see
you're just two little peas

33:59.179 --> 34:01.981
in an archeological pod, so...

34:01.982 --> 34:05.285
I will leave Miss Hartley to
beguile you further, Mr. Walsh.

34:05.286 --> 34:06.753
- Thank you.
- The urn has been prepared

34:06.754 --> 34:08.321
for your inspection,
so whenever you're ready,

34:08.322 --> 34:10.722
Miss Hartley will show you
the way. Take your time.

34:31.577 --> 34:33.413
- Thank you.
- Isn't it something?

34:33.414 --> 34:35.014
Quite.

34:35.014 --> 34:37.882
The guard will remain outside
the door for security.

34:43.656 --> 34:45.824
- You got the car?
- I'm picking it up tonight.

34:45.826 --> 34:48.060
Be at the side door at 10.

35:15.088 --> 35:17.957
Impressive hiding spot.

35:17.958 --> 35:20.358
Yeah. They've done this before.

35:39.345 --> 35:41.780
There it is, the old switcheroo.

35:51.057 --> 35:54.494
Now, Mr. Walsh,
don't keep us in suspense

35:54.495 --> 35:57.330
a moment longer. What do you say?

35:57.331 --> 35:59.132
Mrs. Amory,

35:59.133 --> 36:02.135
patrons of the Royal Ontario Museum,

36:02.136 --> 36:05.338
it is my pleasure
to confirm this is a rare

36:05.339 --> 36:07.073
and marvellous piece.

36:07.074 --> 36:10.877
A genuine 15th century Incan urn...

36:10.878 --> 36:14.479
worthy of a place of honour
in your fine institution.

36:17.016 --> 36:20.953
And just one matter remaining.
Miss Hartley, your cheque.

36:20.954 --> 36:23.389
And I hope you bring us many more

36:23.390 --> 36:24.924
of your wondrous finds.

36:24.925 --> 36:27.359
Count on it, Mrs. Amory.

36:38.271 --> 36:39.572
Did they suspect anything?

36:39.573 --> 36:41.240
Nope. The trap's all set.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.176
So, Ronald just has to walk into it.

36:43.177 --> 36:46.813
- What about Marian?
- I'll take care of Marian.

37:22.515 --> 37:24.550
Looking for this, Mr. Walsh?

37:24.551 --> 37:26.319
Or should we call you Ronald Parkes?

37:45.538 --> 37:47.138
I got him. You go.

37:55.281 --> 37:57.383
- Hello, Marian.
- What? What are you...

37:57.384 --> 37:59.952
- Expecting someone else?
- Don't be ridiculous.

37:59.953 --> 38:01.320
- I was just leaving.
- I don't think so.

38:01.321 --> 38:04.190
- You're going down for murder.
- I didn't kill anyone.

38:04.191 --> 38:06.759
I contacted the Field Museum
in Chicago.

38:06.760 --> 38:09.295
It turns out they have
the exact same Peruvian urn

38:09.296 --> 38:11.264
in their collection,
authenticated by one

38:11.265 --> 38:12.832
Michael Walsh.

38:12.833 --> 38:15.034
You pulled the exact same con there.

38:15.035 --> 38:16.569
The minute Walsh saw you,

38:16.570 --> 38:18.437
you knew the game would be over,

38:18.438 --> 38:20.006
so you and your partner killed him.

38:20.007 --> 38:21.874
You should mind your own business.

38:21.875 --> 38:23.509
You became my business the minute

38:23.510 --> 38:25.443
you cheated Asim in Cairo.

38:39.992 --> 38:42.595
The brush work, the seaming.

38:42.596 --> 38:45.464
This... this detail.

38:45.465 --> 38:47.033
It's a fine piece indeed.

38:47.034 --> 38:48.568
Isn't it just.

38:48.569 --> 38:50.469
So, you think it's the real deal?

38:50.470 --> 38:52.538
There's no question.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.273
I knew it!

38:54.274 --> 38:56.742
I mean, I, I, I, I kind of have an eye

38:56.743 --> 38:59.078
for, for the genuine article.

39:00.781 --> 39:03.882
Tell me, how did you
come upon this urn?

39:05.084 --> 39:07.119
Well, Mr. Bingham...

39:07.120 --> 39:08.788
This is an interesting story.

39:08.789 --> 39:10.089
Well, I'm gonna
level with you, Bingham.

39:10.090 --> 39:12.357
You're not just here to authenticate.

39:13.926 --> 39:15.928
Well, you have my attention,
Miss Drake.

39:15.929 --> 39:18.364
There's something else about the urn

39:18.365 --> 39:20.766
that I think you might
find interesting.

39:20.767 --> 39:22.867
Really?

39:23.903 --> 39:25.103
I...

39:27.139 --> 39:28.908
NO!

39:28.909 --> 39:31.042
Hold onto your hair, Nora!

39:31.944 --> 39:33.345
Why?!

39:37.783 --> 39:38.917
Take a peek.

39:40.620 --> 39:42.821
Does it look familiar?

39:46.058 --> 39:47.359
My God...

39:50.696 --> 39:52.832
It's the map to the Incan gold.

39:52.833 --> 39:54.132
Gold? What gold?

39:56.102 --> 39:58.337
After Marian and her partner
were carted away,

39:58.338 --> 40:00.273
I took a closer look at the urn and...

40:00.274 --> 40:01.806
I found this.

40:04.910 --> 40:06.111
Look familiar?

40:07.780 --> 40:09.682
I'll be damned...

40:09.683 --> 40:11.617
the symbol of the spider.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.686
I remember you showing me the drawing

40:13.687 --> 40:15.788
and there was nothing
on the outside of the urn,

40:15.789 --> 40:17.889
so there was
only one other possibility.

40:19.792 --> 40:21.627
Well, wouldn't you know it?

40:21.628 --> 40:23.963
Only Frankie Drake could
smash a priceless urn

40:23.964 --> 40:26.131
and find some map to lost treasure.

40:26.932 --> 40:28.566
She gets that from me.

40:38.614 --> 40:40.615
My deepest sympathies, Mrs. Walsh.

40:40.616 --> 40:43.451
You are kindness itself.
And a dedicated coroner.

40:43.452 --> 40:46.721
- I'm not the actual coroner.
- Well you should be.

40:46.722 --> 40:49.189
I'm grateful beyond words to you both.

40:53.060 --> 40:54.795
She's right.
You should be the coroner.

40:54.796 --> 40:56.497
And you should be the chief of police.

40:56.498 --> 40:58.933
Don't let anyone hear you say that.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.801
If our bosses knew
how competent we are...

41:00.802 --> 41:02.803
We'd lose our jobs for sure.

41:06.841 --> 41:08.643
Narrowing down the vastness
of the mountain range will

41:08.644 --> 41:11.045
- be a challenge.
- This painted map is

41:11.046 --> 41:13.180
very specific.

41:13.181 --> 41:16.083
This... this valley could
be a reference point.

41:16.084 --> 41:19.419
Howard Carter's grid technique
could prove to be useful.

41:21.322 --> 41:23.189
Methodical and laborious.

41:24.759 --> 41:27.028
But scientific and effective.

41:27.029 --> 41:29.229
Well, where's the fun in that?

41:38.372 --> 41:40.039
Join my treasure hunt.

41:41.342 --> 41:43.009
We'd make a great team.

41:46.013 --> 41:47.680
The thrill is in the chase, isn't it?

41:49.717 --> 41:51.918
Well, it's a tempting offer, but...

41:53.020 --> 41:54.554
I'm a detective now.

41:56.357 --> 41:58.359
And who knows where
your next case will take you.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.194
And what I might have to smash.

42:00.195 --> 42:01.928
Right.

42:04.965 --> 42:07.468
Well...

42:07.469 --> 42:09.470
if you change your mind,

42:09.471 --> 42:11.271
you can find me in the Peruvian Andes.

42:13.374 --> 42:15.008
Just look for the hat.

42:23.719 --> 42:25.653
Sorry about the urn.

42:25.654 --> 42:27.988
Yeah. How about a little
warning next time you smash

42:27.989 --> 42:29.757
something priceless? Your mother's got

42:29.758 --> 42:31.325
a dodgy pelvic floor.

42:31.326 --> 42:33.627
Well, console yourself knowing
that Marian used the urn

42:33.628 --> 42:35.830
for a cheap con without
ever knowing its true value.

42:35.831 --> 42:38.032
A delicious irony,
I will give you that.

42:38.033 --> 42:39.800
I still can't believe
that you didn't see through her.

42:39.801 --> 42:41.736
Yeah, I don't know.
I think going legit

42:41.737 --> 42:44.505
somehow clouded my thinking.
Well, it won't happen again.

42:44.506 --> 42:46.841
Trust me. And for starters,
I'm quitting the board

42:46.842 --> 42:49.110
- of this place.
- They let you go?

42:49.111 --> 42:52.046
Yeah. All that juicy publicity?
They can kiss that goodbye!

42:52.047 --> 42:54.048
So, they did give you the boot.

42:54.049 --> 42:55.950
Must you harp?

42:55.951 --> 42:58.753
So, tell me about
the charming Mr. Bingham.

42:58.754 --> 43:01.522
- There's nothing to tell.
- Sure there is.

43:01.523 --> 43:03.591
You've got a thing for archeologists.

43:03.592 --> 43:05.559
- How would you know?
- Mother's intuition.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.062
- There's no such thing.
- So, you fancy a drink or what?

43:08.063 --> 43:09.597
Thought you'd never ask.
