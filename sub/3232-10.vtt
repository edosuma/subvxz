02:21.000 --> 02:24.754
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

02:25.360 --> 02:28.432
Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.556
-What?
-Just take the rest of the week.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.354
Please. You've earned it.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.198
Don't push it.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.392
Besides, I want you well
for the weekend.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.949
Mom wants to party.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.675
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.111
Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.073
Just family and a few friends.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.393
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

02:59.320 --> 03:00.753
Sounds good.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.593
Oh, thank you.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.358
Now...

03:16.160 --> 03:18.310
...what are you supposed
to do today?

03:18.520 --> 03:21.717
-Nothing.
-Excellent.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.915
Brownie points for taking a nap.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.633
Can you meet?

05:02.560 --> 05:06.633
I thought maybe you
might have, you know...

05:06.840 --> 05:08.239
...kicked.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.670
Signed-- Signed off.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.348
I was even checking the obits.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.478
No such luck.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.358
So where does it stand?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.629
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

05:23.840 --> 05:26.593
"l deserve this. I'm an asshole."

05:26.800 --> 05:28.438
What's the upshot?

05:29.400 --> 05:30.674
The upshot.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.717
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

05:40.760 --> 05:41.715
Damn.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.115
Actually, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.473
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.197
In fact...

05:54.560 --> 05:57.233
...the news is all good.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.878
What do you mean, good?

06:00.800 --> 06:03.360
You mean, like, "good" good?

06:04.880 --> 06:06.518
What, you mean, like,
remission good?

06:08.040 --> 06:12.989
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
I still have cancer.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.275
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumours.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.917
How significant?

06:19.520 --> 06:21.192
Eighty percent.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.471
Dude. No way.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.638
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch...

06:28.120 --> 06:31.635
...but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.673
That's awesome. Serious?

06:34.880 --> 06:37.474
That's-- That's great, man.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.070
I mean, my aunt, she never--
I mean, you know, at your stage...

06:41.280 --> 06:43.396
...I didn't think that could happen.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.999
Yeah.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.590
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

06:47.800 --> 06:50.473
No. You must be so psyched.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.397
Of course. I am.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.835
Okay, now we....

06:58.720 --> 07:01.075
I mean, what do we...?

07:01.280 --> 07:04.113
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.109
So how do you want to...

07:12.760 --> 07:15.228
...you know, proceed...

07:15.440 --> 07:18.000
...in light of this kick-ass news?

07:20.800 --> 07:25.078
We'll take our time
and stay cautious.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.191
Sell off what we have.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.958
And then....

07:32.280 --> 07:35.477
Well, then I guess...

07:36.800 --> 07:38.199
...I'm done.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.435
-Batter up.
-Everyone?

08:01.200 --> 08:03.760
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast...

08:04.360 --> 08:08.717
-...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
-Somebody kill the music.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.597
I know one party
can't begin to repay...

08:12.800 --> 08:17.794
...all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.195
But then again...

08:20.400 --> 08:24.757
...Hank does make
one mean margarita.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.912
We really do want to thank you.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.395
These last few months have been...

08:34.039 --> 08:38.510
...wow, a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.075
But I have to say
WaIt's come through it like a champ.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.272
-All right.
-Honey, I'm so proud of you.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.078
We all are.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.430
Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. I am.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.517
But it's true. It really is.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.030
And for the first time
in a long time...

08:58.240 --> 09:01.073
...we are so excited about the future.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.513
Okay, anyway...

09:05.720 --> 09:08.280
...I want to also
express my gratitude...

09:08.480 --> 09:13.235
...to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.273
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.152
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz...

09:18.360 --> 09:21.238
...for those of you
who don't know them, are....

09:21.880 --> 09:25.031
Well, they're heroes.

09:25.240 --> 09:28.994
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer...

09:29.200 --> 09:31.873
...to pay for WaIt's treatment.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.478
And they did.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.199
So...

09:37.960 --> 09:39.313
...to Gretchen and Elliott.

09:39.800 --> 09:43.076
-To Gretchen and Elliot.
-Cheers.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.033
Hey, how about the man of the hour?
Come on.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.559
-Speech.
-Yes.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.193
-Speech.
-Yeah, Dad.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.675
Come on, Walt. Speech.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.478
Well, it's....

09:55.680 --> 09:57.159
It's kind of funny.

09:57.680 --> 10:02.595
When I got my diagnosis, cancer...

10:03.320 --> 10:06.790
...I said to myself, you know:

10:07.040 --> 10:08.189
"Why me?"

10:10.320 --> 10:11.799
And then...

10:13.120 --> 10:16.112
...the other day,
when I got the good news...

10:19.200 --> 10:21.430
...I said the same thing.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.794
Anyway.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.877
Thank you for coming.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.517
And enjoy.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.199
-All right, cheers.
-Yeah.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.674
Cheers.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.998
Inspirational.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.312
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

10:49.520 --> 10:50.509
I'll tell you that much.

10:50.720 --> 10:54.156
A little mercury switch,
9-volt battery...

10:54.360 --> 10:58.319
...five or six ounces of C-4,
that's how those cartel boys party.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.194
Yeah, but why a turtle?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.960
Oh, that's the best part. It was a....

11:04.160 --> 11:06.469
It was a.... What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

11:06.960 --> 11:10.191
Not a metaphor, not an analogy,
it's a....

11:10.400 --> 11:12.789
Walt, what's the word
I'm looking for?

11:14.560 --> 11:15.993
Anyway...

11:16.200 --> 11:19.795
...Tortuga. Okay?
That was the name of our snitch.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.195
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?

11:22.400 --> 11:26.916
Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
I never knew the difference myself.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.395
Hey, top me off there,
will you, buddy?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.192
Anyway.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.153
Poetic.

11:33.360 --> 11:37.194
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
That's the word.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.231
I guess that's the word.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.435
Go ahead.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.712
Better not let your mom see.

12:19.520 --> 12:24.275
Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair.
Maybe two.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.433
-There's no worm in this, right?
-No, that would be mescal.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.835
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

12:31.040 --> 12:33.998
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.431
Had this firearm instructor
who was....

12:37.640 --> 12:40.200
He was a good old boy, you know?
Hey. There you go. Thanks.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.631
I mean, this guy could put them away
like he had two livers, okay?

12:43.840 --> 12:46.354
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.437
We were drinking mescal stupid.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.676
But-- Hey, hey.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.634
Walt, what you doing there?

12:56.040 --> 12:57.473
What does it look like I'm doing?

12:58.960 --> 13:00.598
The kid's 16.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.111
What are you going for,
Father of the Year?

13:04.640 --> 13:06.756
What are you looking at him for?

13:13.760 --> 13:15.432
We're celebrating. Come on.

13:19.480 --> 13:20.993
That's all right.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.588
No.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.118
Jesus.

13:45.720 --> 13:49.429
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

13:49.640 --> 13:52.677
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.153
Hey.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.669
Bring the bottle back.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.518
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.398
It's my son. My bottle. My house.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.997
-It's all right.
-What are you waiting for?

14:16.200 --> 14:17.349
Bring it back.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.671
Why don't we just call it a day?

14:27.920 --> 14:29.399
All right, pal?

14:31.760 --> 14:34.877
-We good?
-The bottle.

14:36.880 --> 14:37.869
Now.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.797
What's going on?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.353
Jesus.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.555
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.352
Oh, my God.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.391
Okay. Okay.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.677
There you go. Okay. That's it.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.075
Just get it out. That's okay.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.989
This is your brain.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.432
This is your brain on drugs.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.751
You weren't supposed to wake up.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.076
Ever or...?

15:48.960 --> 15:53.670
No, I was just thinking
that I'd bring it, you know, in.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.276
You want me to go back to bed?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.956
No, I guess that'd be kind of--

16:00.800 --> 16:02.358
No.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.319
Need some help?

16:06.520 --> 16:08.351
No, I got it.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.479
Just have a seat.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.432
Is there any coffee?

16:15.440 --> 16:17.715
Yeah, shit. One second.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.797
Well, at least let me do that.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.037
No, I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

16:30.840 --> 16:34.150
All right. Here.
You take the good one.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.239
It's huevos rancheros.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.234
-I can tell.
-Yeah?

16:42.800 --> 16:45.075
-Fork.
-Oh, yeah.

16:54.520 --> 16:55.839
There you go.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.396
So, what are you up to today?
Working?

17:00.600 --> 17:03.956
-Whatever that means.
-No.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.438
I'm all yours.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.789
Really?

17:49.640 --> 17:53.474
Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.874
Hi.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.151
I just wanted to say that....

18:01.360 --> 18:02.509
No.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.393
We'll talk tonight...

18:07.840 --> 18:10.229
...but I wanted to say that...

18:12.000 --> 18:15.037
...I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday...

18:15.240 --> 18:17.071
...but it wasn't me.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.279
And I'm sorry.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.113
Love you.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.758
Oh, boy.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.795
I just wanted to say that....

19:18.000 --> 19:19.149
No.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.872
We'll talk tonight,
but I wanted to say that....

19:24.080 --> 19:25.399
Hey there.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.354
-Wow, who brought the churros?
-That would be me.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.870
If I leave them at home, I'll just
wind up eating them all myself, so....

19:34.720 --> 19:38.838
They're actually-- They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.871
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

19:42.280 --> 19:43.838
Actually...

19:44.040 --> 19:45.598
...WaIt's got....

19:47.840 --> 19:51.469
He's been battling cancer.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.033
-Skyler--
-And last week we got good news.

19:55.240 --> 19:59.199
-I'm so sorry.
-But we're really optimistic.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.674
Great.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.390
-Great. Good news is great.
-Yeah.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.955
Yeah, it is. It really is.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.393
Well...

20:11.840 --> 20:14.354
...feel free to bring these any time.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.039
Yeah.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.915
Got some real beauts.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.434
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.119
Yeah?

20:38.120 --> 20:41.078
Then again, what about tankless?

20:42.560 --> 20:44.278
Sure. We got them.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.994
The good ones will
really run up your price though.

20:47.200 --> 20:50.158
Set you back about 1200.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.435
It's not an issue.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.348
You want installation, right?

20:57.560 --> 21:01.997
-No. I'm gonna do it myself.
-That's what I like to hear.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.152
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

21:17.040 --> 21:19.270
That's Hover Man.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.233
He can surf, skate, glide...

21:22.440 --> 21:26.797
...whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.389
That's cool. Great lines.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.910
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

21:36.600 --> 21:38.989
That's Kanga-man.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.668
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

21:42.280 --> 21:45.989
-And who's this in his pouch?
-His sidekick, Joey.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.638
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know...

21:50.080 --> 21:51.354
...fights crime.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.393
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.912
You know that, right?

21:57.240 --> 21:59.595
Only female kangaroos
have pouches.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.199
Yeah, yeah, I know.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.755
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.155
He's a product of experimentation.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.195
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

22:12.280 --> 22:15.511
-And this is?
-It's Backwardo.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.273
Wait, no. I actually--
I changed it to Rewindo.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.471
Anyways, he goes backwards.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.272
He can make everything
go in reverse.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.436
Time and stuff? Like time travelling?

22:25.640 --> 22:28.074
No, he just walks backwards.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.950
He walks backwards?

22:31.320 --> 22:34.198
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

22:34.400 --> 22:36.675
No, I mean, he does it,
like, really fast.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.678
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

22:39.880 --> 22:43.031
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.832
Okay.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.429
Yo, I was a kid...

22:47.640 --> 22:49.119
...when I drew all these.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.750
It was like four years ago.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.558
-They all look like you.
-What?

22:56.280 --> 22:58.475
It's you in all of these.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.713
No.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.798
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.070
Oh, shut up.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.236
Like you never wanted
a superpower.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.516
-ls that your door or mine?
-I don't know.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.597
It sounds like mine.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.396
-I gotta go.
-Where?

23:33.880 --> 23:36.394
Hey, where?

23:39.400 --> 23:41.356
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?

23:50.480 --> 23:51.879
Jane.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.753
Jane.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.875
-Hey, Dad.
-There you are.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.233
Hi, honey.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.273
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.478
Yeah, sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.796
Finally realised that
I wasn't the drum track?

24:32.120 --> 24:34.395
-Exactly.
-Well, I was in the neighbourhood.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.239
Was wondering if you wanted
to grab some lunch.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.634
Sure. Yeah.

24:39.360 --> 24:43.353
Hey, this your dad?

24:44.680 --> 24:46.193
-Yes.
-Hello.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.594
Hi.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.438
This is the new tenant.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.154
-Donald.
-Jesse.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.595
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

25:01.440 --> 25:03.112
-No.
-Dad, why don't you come in?

25:03.320 --> 25:04.833
It was nice seeing you.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.873
-lt was nice to meet you.
-You too.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.639
Hey, Dad.

25:39.880 --> 25:43.589
-Hey, son. Are you home early?
-No.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.318
Oh, man.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.790
It was a good day?

25:50.400 --> 25:53.836
Now it is. Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.951
Yes. Yes, indeed.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.516
Top of the line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.039
-Sweet.
-Yeah.

26:01.240 --> 26:05.153
-Hey, want to take her for a spin?
-Oh, yeah.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.916
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

26:08.120 --> 26:11.192
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

26:11.400 --> 26:12.913
Okay.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.718
Pilot in.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.480
Ignition. Bingo.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.193
Okay.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.633
-Ready.
-All right. Let her rip.

26:32.320 --> 26:34.311
Hundred and seventeen
thousand BTUs.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.431
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.949
Built-in corrosion-resistant
draught reducer...

26:39.160 --> 26:41.515
...safety thermocouple
with the pilot burner.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.711
Sounds really good, Dad.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.998
And the energy savings. I mean....

26:46.200 --> 26:48.236
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.113
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make. You okay?

26:51.320 --> 26:53.834
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Okay.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.359
Son...

26:59.200 --> 27:02.795
-...about yesterday--
-I'm sorry about the pool.

27:04.280 --> 27:08.068
No, no, no, that was not your fault.
Not at all.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.879
See, your....

27:11.440 --> 27:13.556
Your old man embarrassed himself...

27:13.760 --> 27:15.910
...and I'm not very proud
of my behaviour.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.749
I have to say I feel very foolish.

27:22.360 --> 27:26.194
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.597
No. No. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

27:29.800 --> 27:33.509
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.750
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

27:40.640 --> 27:43.473
I should have used
better judgement all around.

27:44.440 --> 27:47.512
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right...

27:47.720 --> 27:49.790
...and for that I'm very sorry.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.158
But I kept up, right?

27:54.160 --> 27:57.994
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.196
I have some tools to put away.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.159
Hey.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.395
Yo.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.670
You want to catch a movie later?

29:16.920 --> 29:18.353
Yo.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.751
-What?
-What was that all about?

29:23.680 --> 29:24.954
What?

29:25.240 --> 29:27.470
Before. With your dad.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.113
It wasn't about anything.

29:30.320 --> 29:35.155
Oh, okay, so I totally
just misread your total dis?

29:35.360 --> 29:37.510
If anything, I was doing you a favour.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.233
A favour?

29:39.880 --> 29:42.030
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.834
-He seemed cool to me.
-Yeah, well.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.237
-So, what's the deal?
-There's no deal.

29:48.440 --> 29:51.637
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.273
-How's that?
-I mean...

29:55.720 --> 29:58.393
...I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.549
I bought a filter.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.035
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.155
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.759
So?

30:09.400 --> 30:11.277
-So?
-You think I'm gonna be all like:

30:11.480 --> 30:13.436
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.995
And by the way,
I'm sleeping with him"?

30:17.120 --> 30:18.633
That's all you think you're doing?

30:19.200 --> 30:21.350
-Why do you even care about my dad?
-I don't.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.755
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

30:23.960 --> 30:27.430
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.949
-Us.
-Yeah.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.075
You and me.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.910
Who's you and me?

30:43.520 --> 30:45.033
I'm out of here.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.159
Oh, boy.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.393
Dad?

32:40.560 --> 32:42.869
Dad? Hello?

32:43.480 --> 32:45.198
What? Oh, hey.

32:46.680 --> 32:49.148
-What are you doing?
-We've got rot.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.874
-Rot?
-Yeah. Here.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.389
I'll show you. Here.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.589
Take a look at that.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.838
See that? Yeah.
Ever seen anything like it?

33:02.360 --> 33:04.635
-It's wood.
-It's wood...

33:04.840 --> 33:06.478
...that contains fruiting bodies.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.309
Fruity what?

33:08.800 --> 33:11.633
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.796
I don't really see anything.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.310
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.031
Then you cut it all out.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.551
You just cut it out and start fresh.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.200
Well, better get to it.

33:26.560 --> 33:29.358
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

33:30.040 --> 33:31.917
Not if I can help it.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.715
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?

34:01.240 --> 34:04.630
-Go home already.
-I will. I will.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.188
Hey, can I just ask...

34:10.159 --> 34:12.754
-...the Keller account?
-The Keller account?

34:12.960 --> 34:16.475
It's listed as a current asset
on this balance sheet...

34:16.679 --> 34:20.559
...but the invoice was never presented
to accounts receivable, so....

34:20.760 --> 34:21.748
Oh, God.

34:21.960 --> 34:25.032
One of these days I'm gonna just
sort through all the Dad stuff.

34:25.239 --> 34:28.391
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships...

34:28.600 --> 34:30.511
...with these little companies.

34:30.960 --> 34:34.157
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.553
Right.

34:37.280 --> 34:40.112
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me lock you in, are you?

34:40.760 --> 34:42.193
Sky?

34:44.280 --> 34:45.315
Skyler?

34:46.440 --> 34:48.078
Jesus.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.356
No, I'm fine.

34:53.480 --> 34:57.439
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.352
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.559
What's wrong?

35:12.040 --> 35:13.792
I guess it just...

35:16.440 --> 35:19.750
...doesn't feel any different.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.952
The good news?

35:28.160 --> 35:32.073
I mean, nothing's really changed.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.756
It's just postponed.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.558
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.955
But lately, it just feels like....

35:48.840 --> 35:50.398
More tunnel.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.552
I'm sorry.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.954
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.631
I don't know.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.112
For me, it was the flu.

36:06.680 --> 36:09.831
-What?
-My dad rallied at the end.

36:10.040 --> 36:12.315
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got...

36:12.520 --> 36:14.954
...different circumstances,
but we were happy...

36:15.160 --> 36:16.718
...we were over the moon.

36:16.920 --> 36:20.037
And right then, I got sick.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.114
Flu.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

36:23.320 --> 36:26.073
Couldn't get out of bed,
I couldn't move.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.034
-Great timing, huh?
-Yeah.

36:30.360 --> 36:33.875
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking:

36:34.080 --> 36:35.593
"Why now?"

36:38.560 --> 36:40.437
Being that rock.

36:41.560 --> 36:42.959
You know...

36:43.480 --> 36:47.678
...being that rock
takes everything you got.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.199
Yeah.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.071
--causing the housing prices
to trend.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.636
Foreclosures are being fuelled
by a spike in....

37:57.520 --> 38:01.559
The economy is rapidly deteriorating
and unemployment is climbing.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.355
With Americans losing money over
rising inflation and tight spending...

38:05.560 --> 38:07.915
... the housing market
is unlikely to rebound...

38:08.120 --> 38:10.680
...spelling more pain
for the economy.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.033
Yeah.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.954
Are you going to work today?

38:43.280 --> 38:45.316
Skyler, there's rot.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.433
I'm going back.

40:24.120 --> 40:27.795
All right. We'll take care of that
tomorrow. Okay, good night.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.910
-Good night, Ted.
-Good night.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.151
Oh, damn.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.952
-Clumsy.
-I got it.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.310
No, no, Ted.
You don't have to do that.

41:14.160 --> 41:17.596
Get organised. Storage containers
to meet every need...

41:17.800 --> 41:20.268
...big or small, on Aisle 3.

41:20.480 --> 41:23.995
Stashing your stuff
has never been so easy.

41:35.480 --> 41:38.597
Get a thicker, fuller lawn
in less than six weeks.

41:38.800 --> 41:41.837
Why can't the grass
always be greener on your side?

41:42.040 --> 41:44.554
Go to Aisle 10 to go green.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.598
Get a manager
on Checkout 4, please.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.836
Manager to Checkout 4.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.957
Pest problems? No problem.

42:05.160 --> 42:08.789
Your extermination destination
is Aisle 6.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.116
You're buying the wrong matches.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.671
-What?
-Those matches.

42:13.880 --> 42:15.074
They're the wrong kind.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.309
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips...

42:18.520 --> 42:20.317
...not the matches themselves.

42:20.520 --> 42:24.069
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

42:28.360 --> 42:29.998
More striker strips. You understand?

42:30.800 --> 42:32.836
Those only have the one.

42:33.040 --> 42:35.429
And don't buy everything
in one place.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.834
Do it piecemeal.

42:37.040 --> 42:40.350
Different items, different stores.
