00:08.299 --> 00:10.926
Monica, that was the best
Thanksgiving dinner ever.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.721
It was so good. I think you killed us.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.766
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.269
I need something sweet.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.230
Does anyone wanna watch TV?

00:23.398 --> 00:24.940
Yeah. Sure.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.278
Monica, your remote doesn't work.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.448
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.866
Oh.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.994
Oh, forget it.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.538
Hey, you know what we should all do?

00:39.706 --> 00:43.125
We should play that game where everyone
says one thing they're thankful for.

00:43.293 --> 00:48.088
Oh, I... I am thankful for this
beautiful fall we've been having.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.923
- Very nice.
- Sweet, Joe.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.342
Yeah, the other day,
I was at the bus stop...

00:52.510 --> 00:54.928
...and this lovely fall breeze
came in out of nowhere...

00:55.096 --> 00:57.097
...and blew this chick's skirt right up.

00:58.683 --> 01:02.895
Oh, which reminds me,
I'm also thankful for thongs.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.157
It's not so much an underpant
as it is a feat of engineering.

01:58.576 --> 02:02.913
It's amazing how much they can do
with so little material.

02:03.081 --> 02:07.668
And the way they play with your mind.
I mean, is it there? Is it not there?

02:08.294 --> 02:10.838
Are you aware that you're still talking?

02:12.006 --> 02:15.592
Is anyone thankful for anything else
besides a thong?

02:16.010 --> 02:17.302
Huh. I don't know what to pick.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.389
Am I more thankful for my divorce,
or my eviction? Hmm.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.851
Wow, see, and I didn't think you'd be able
to come up with anything.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.273
I'm sorry. It's just this is the worst
Thanksgiving ever.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.817
No, no, no. I am the king
of bad Thanksgivings.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.153
You can't just swoop in here
with your bad marriage...

02:34.320 --> 02:36.029
...and take that away from me.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.073
You're not gonna tell the whole story...

02:38.241 --> 02:40.242
...about how your parents
got divorced, are you?

02:40.535 --> 02:42.035
No, no.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.204
Come on. I want to hear it.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.710
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without Chandler bumming us out.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.713
It's a tradition, like the parade.

02:52.881 --> 02:57.301
If the parade decided it was gay, moved out
and abandoned its entire family.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.763
Now, Chandler, dear.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.099
Just because your father and I
are getting a divorce...

03:04.267 --> 03:06.059
...doesn't mean we don't love you.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.769
It just means...

03:07.937 --> 03:11.648
...he would rather sleep
with the houseboy than with me.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.987
More turkey, Mr. Chandler?

03:20.950 --> 03:24.786
You're right, yours is worse.
You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.289
I don't know about that.
I've got one that's worse.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.457
Really? Worse than:

03:28.625 --> 03:30.876
"More turkey, Mr. Chandler?"

03:33.129 --> 03:35.297
Did the little rich boy
had a problem with the butler?

03:35.465 --> 03:37.633
Yes, mine's worse.

03:43.264 --> 03:46.725
More bandages! More bandages!

03:46.893 --> 03:49.770
Please, can I get
some more bandages in here?

03:49.938 --> 03:52.564
This man is... Aah!

03:56.152 --> 03:58.070
Oh, no.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.991
In this life, Phoebe.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.118
Oh, this life.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.995
Oh, okay. No, Chandler's is worse.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.333
Man, it must be so cool
remembering stuff like that.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.044
I don't have any past life memories.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.798
Of course, you don't, sweetie.
You're brand-new.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.010
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.721
- Oh, let's not tell this story.
- Oh, come on.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.431
Oh, no! I know! I know!

04:26.599 --> 04:30.394
It's the one where Joey got
Monica's turkey stuck on his head.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.604
- What?
- What?

04:32.772 --> 04:35.524
Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.109
Hey, it's not like it sounds.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.361
It's exactly like it sounds.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.078
Hello?

04:50.081 --> 04:51.748
Hello?

04:54.210 --> 04:56.461
- Phoebe?
- Joey?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.630
What's going on?

05:01.676 --> 05:02.801
Oh, my God.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.344
I know.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.596
It's stuck.

05:08.182 --> 05:10.892
Step. How did it get on?

05:11.060 --> 05:13.645
I put it on to scare Chandler.

05:13.813 --> 05:17.316
Oh, my God.
Monica's going to totally freak out.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.984
Well, then help me get it off.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.945
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

05:22.530 --> 05:26.825
Of course it smells really bad.
You have your head up a dead animal.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.125
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.670
Hey, did you get the turkey...?
Oh, my God!

05:38.838 --> 05:40.505
Oh, my God!

05:40.923 --> 05:42.466
Who is that?

05:42.633 --> 05:44.384
It's Joey.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.512
What are you doing?
Is this supposed to be funny?

05:47.680 --> 05:51.058
No, it's not supposed to be funny.
It's supposed to be scary.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.435
Get that off now.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.520
I can't. It's stuck.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.190
Well, I don't care.
That turkey has to feed 20 people.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.400
They're not going to eat it off your head.

06:01.069 --> 06:04.696
Hold on, okay? Let's just all think.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.411
Okay, I got it. Phoebe?

06:11.579 --> 06:12.954
All right. You pull.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.582
I'm gonna spread the legs
as wide as I can.

06:18.669 --> 06:21.463
- Joey, now is not the time.
- Yeah. Sorry. Right, sorry.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.342
Okay, count to three. One, two...

06:25.510 --> 06:27.010
...three.

06:30.264 --> 06:34.267
It worked. I scared you. I knew it. Ha, ha!

06:35.895 --> 06:39.147
- I'm over here, big guy.
- Yeah, you are. Ha, ha!

06:39.315 --> 06:42.526
I scared you. Whoo!

06:44.612 --> 06:46.780
You did look like an idiot.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.534
Hey, I wasn't the only one
who looked like an idiot, all right?

06:51.285 --> 06:53.912
Remember when Ross tried to say
"butternut squash"...

06:54.080 --> 06:57.499
...and it came out, "squatternut bosh"?

06:59.919 --> 07:02.170
Yeah, that's the same.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.799
That's it. That's my worst Thanksgiving.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.760
Oh, wait. That can't be the one
that Rachel was talking about...

07:08.928 --> 07:11.388
...because she didn't even know
that that happened.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.723
- So, what's yours?
- What was it?

07:13.891 --> 07:16.351
Um, I really don't wanna tell this story.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.519
Oh, come on, Monica.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.648
Reliving past pain and getting depressed
is what Thanksgiving's all about.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.735
You know, for me, anyway.
And, of course, the Indians.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.240
Look, of all people,
you do not want me to tell this story.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.200
What is that supposed to mean?

07:33.578 --> 07:35.454
Monica, I think Rachel's here.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.205
I'll get it.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.965
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Not for me.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.758
Chip and I broke up.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.178
Oh. Why?

07:51.345 --> 07:52.554
Well, what happened?

07:52.722 --> 07:55.932
You know how my parents are out of town,
and Chip was gonna come over?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.643
Yeah, yeah. And you were
gonna give him, you know...

07:58.811 --> 08:00.437
...your "flower."

08:01.314 --> 08:03.356
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?

08:03.524 --> 08:06.610
It really creeps me out
when you call it that.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.153
Okay, and by the way...

08:08.321 --> 08:12.073
...while we're at it, a guy's thing
is not called his "tenderness."

08:15.119 --> 08:16.995
Believe me.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.582
- Hi.
- Hi, Rachel.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.876
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You too, sweetheart.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.628
Hey.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.047
Oh. Hi.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.884
Uh, everyone...

08:31.052 --> 08:33.178
...this is Chandler.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.390
My roommate
and lead singer of our band. Heh.

08:39.434 --> 08:40.434
Ross?

08:40.602 --> 08:42.437
Oh. This is Monica.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.981
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.400
Okay.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.613
I'm so glad you could come, Chandler.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.949
We've got plenty of food,
so I hope you're hungry.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.243
Oh, Mom, no, no,
Chandler hates Thanksgiving...

08:56.410 --> 08:58.411
...and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.

08:58.579 --> 09:02.165
Oh. Well, I'm so glad
you brought him here, then.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.626
Hey, Chandler, um...

09:04.794 --> 09:07.629
If you want, I can make you some
macaroni and cheese for dinner.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.798
As long as the Pilgrims didn't eat it,
then I'm in.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.720
Damn it.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.647
So, uh, Rach...

09:25.815 --> 09:28.650
Does it...? Does it feel weird
around here now?

09:28.818 --> 09:31.695
You know,
since I've been away at college?

09:31.862 --> 09:33.113
Oh.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.281
No, not really.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.367
That's cool.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.327
So...

09:43.124 --> 09:49.129
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me
for that slut, Nancy Branson.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.880
I am never going out with him again.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.592
I don't care how much he begs.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.845
I think his begging days are over,
now that he's with Nancy Branson.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.808
You know what?
I've just had it with high-school boys.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.602
They're just silly.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.855
They're just silly, stupid boys.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.398
I'm gonna start dating men.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.943
Uh, I'm sorry, Judy.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.780
I couldn't find that bowl
you and Jack were looking for.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.619
Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.830
Monica.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.545
Hey, Chandler?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.217
Did you like
the macaroni and cheese?

10:36.385 --> 10:38.428
Oh, yeah. It was great.
You should be a chef.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.764
Okay.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.935
Guess what.

10:46.103 --> 10:49.314
All this stuff about Nancy Branson
being a slut was all a rumor.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.859
Chip dumped her, and he wants
to come over to my house tonight.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.403
- Oh, that is so great.
- I know.

10:55.571 --> 10:58.406
Oh, gosh. Listen,
if you and Chip do it tonight...

10:58.574 --> 11:01.368
...um, promise me
you'll tell me everything?

11:01.535 --> 11:05.413
Oh, totally, totally. It's not that big a deal.
We already kind of did it once, you know.

11:05.581 --> 11:08.917
I know, but this time you're gonna
definitely know whether or not you did it.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.335
I know.

11:10.503 --> 11:15.590
Oh, and Chip promised that this time
it would last at least for an entire song.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.512
So I'm thinking of asking
Rachel out tonight.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.223
You know, maybe playing her that song
we wrote last week.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.059
- "Emotional Knapsack"? Right on.
- Right on.

11:27.228 --> 11:31.606
Oh, uh, but don't take long, okay?
Because we're testing our fake ID's tonight.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.775
Right, Clifford Alvarez?

11:35.611 --> 11:38.488
Listen, Roland Cheng...

11:39.281 --> 11:42.325
...if things go well,
I may be out with her all night.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.786
Dude, don't do that to me.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.497
Oh, no. It's cool, you can stay here.
My parents won't mind.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.709
It's not that. I don't wanna be stuck here
all night with your fat sister.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.168
Hey.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.549
Monica, why don't you finish off
these pies?

11:57.717 --> 12:00.135
I don't have any more room in the fridge.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.596
No.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.182
No, thank you.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.767
Well, Judy, you did it.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.478
She's finally full.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.067
I called you fat?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.611
- I don't even remember that.
- Well, I do.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.615
I'm so sorry. I really am.
But, come on, I was an idiot back then.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.535
I rushed the stage at a Wham! Concert,
for crying out loud.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.664
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.

12:29.832 --> 12:33.084
I can't believe you let
George Michael slap you.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.879
I am really sorry.

12:36.046 --> 12:39.340
That is so terrible. I'm so, so sorry.

12:39.508 --> 12:42.260
Actually, that's not the Thanksgiving
I was talking about.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.138
- Yes, it was.
- No, it wasn't. It was actually...

12:45.306 --> 12:47.056
Thanksgiving's over.
Get ready for Christmas.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.558
Who wants to get a Christmas tree?

12:49.977 --> 12:53.146
Oh, no. I have the cutest Christmas story.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.190
We wanna hear Monica's
Thanksgiving story.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.942
Fine, all right. Mine had a dwarf
that got broke in half.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.069
But, you know, whatever.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.449
So, Rachel, your mom tells me
you changed your major again?

13:04.700 --> 13:05.950
Oh, yeah, I had to.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.245
There was never any parking
by the Psychology building.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.581
- Hi, Rachel.
- Oh, hi.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.667
- Wow. Love your new nose.
- Jack.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.420
What? Dr. Wolfson's an artist.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.005
He removed my mole cluster.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.590
Want to see?

13:22.092 --> 13:24.010
No, God. Please, let me.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.808
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.104
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.607
God, your hair sure is different.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.526
Yeah, we were just talking about that.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.445
Can't we can't believe
how stupid we used to look.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.283
So, uh, where's Monica?

13:47.451 --> 13:49.285
She's upstairs. Monica.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.204
Come down, everyone's here.

13:51.372 --> 13:55.208
Ross, Rachel and the boy
who hates Thanksgiving.

13:58.712 --> 13:59.921
Hi, Chandler.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.131
Oh, my God.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.592
What's the matter?

14:04.760 --> 14:07.220
Is there something on my dress?

14:09.306 --> 14:11.933
You just... You look so different. Terrific.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.685
That dress, that body...

14:13.853 --> 14:15.186
- Dude.
- Sorry.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.148
Yes, yes, Monica is thin. It's wonderful.

14:19.316 --> 14:22.652
But what we really want to hear about
is Ross' new girlfriend.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.196
Oh, Mom... Okay.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.490
Um, ahem, her name is Carol...

14:27.658 --> 14:29.701
...and she's really pretty and smart.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.204
And, uh, she's on the lacrosse team
and the golf team.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.914
Can you believe it?

14:35.082 --> 14:37.000
She plays for both teams.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.714
So, Chandler,
I guess I'll see you at dinner.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.050
- Dude.
- Sorry.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.553
Oh, my God.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.305
That was so awesome.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.599
You totally got him back
for calling you fat.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.517
He was just drooling all over you.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.312
- That must have felt so great.
- Well, it didn't.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.063
What?

14:59.231 --> 15:01.357
Yeah, I mean, I look great.

15:01.525 --> 15:04.235
And yeah, I feel great, and, yeah,
my heart's not in trouble anymore.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.029
Blah, blah, blah.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.907
I just don't feel like I got him back,
you know?

15:09.074 --> 15:11.242
I mean, I just want to humiliate him.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.119
I want him to be, like, naked...

15:13.287 --> 15:16.039
...and I want to point at him
and I wanna laugh.

15:16.707 --> 15:20.627
Okay. That, we may be able to do.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.754
How?

15:22.922 --> 15:26.716
Well, guys tend to get naked
before they're gonna have sex.

15:26.884 --> 15:30.428
What? I mean, I didn't work this hard
and lose all this weight...

15:30.596 --> 15:34.057
...just so I could give my flower
to someone like him.

15:34.642 --> 15:38.269
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that,
no one is ever gonna take it.

15:38.437 --> 15:42.106
And then second of all, you're not gonna
actually have sex with him.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.525
You're just gonna make him think
that you are.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.030
And then when he's naked...

15:49.198 --> 15:51.032
...I can throw him out, lock the door...

15:51.200 --> 15:53.743
...and all our neighbors
will just humiliate him.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.329
And then you will definitely
get him back.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.665
Okay, so how do I make him think
I want to have sex?

15:58.916 --> 16:00.917
Uh, Oh! Here's what you do.

16:01.085 --> 16:05.546
Just act like everything around you
turns you on.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.802
- What do you mean?
- Well, like, anything can be sexy.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.681
Like, um... Oh, okay. Like this dish towel.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.850
Ooh, ooh.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.729
This feels so good against my cheek.

16:21.897 --> 16:25.608
And if I get a little hot,
I can just dab myself with it.

16:26.610 --> 16:30.113
Or I can bring it down to my side
and maybe run it through my fingers...

16:30.280 --> 16:31.781
...while I talk to him.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.909
- I can do that.
- Okay, good, good, good.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.744
Get busy. He's coming. He's coming.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.706
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.460
I was wondering if you could make me
some mac and cheese...

16:44.628 --> 16:46.087
...like last year?

16:47.297 --> 16:48.923
I'd love to.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.388
Ooh.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.099
I love macaroni and cheese.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.896
I love the way this box feels
against my cheek.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.530
- Okay.
- Ooh, and I love carrots.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.948
Oh!

17:16.326 --> 17:19.579
Sometimes I like to put them
between my fingers.

17:21.330 --> 17:22.915
Like this.

17:23.083 --> 17:26.002
And hold them down here
while I talk to you.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.259
Um, and, you know, if I get really hot...

17:33.427 --> 17:37.138
...um, I like to pick up this knife.

17:37.431 --> 17:42.769
And, um, I put the cool steel...

17:42.936 --> 17:44.604
...against, um...

17:45.272 --> 17:47.023
...my body.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.902
Are you all right?

17:51.653 --> 17:53.279
I'm fine.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.712
- What do got?
- Twenty-year-old male.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.090
He's got a severed toe on his right foot.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.508
Ow!

18:14.718 --> 18:16.844
Could you please not do that feet first?

18:17.012 --> 18:20.389
You know where his injury is.
Severed toe, you just said it!

18:22.059 --> 18:24.393
It says here the knife
went right through your shoe.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.979
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.273
- Did you bring the toe?
- Oh, yes.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.609
I have it right here on ice.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.655
Don't worry, son.
We'll just reattach it and then...

18:36.073 --> 18:38.908
- What is it?
- You brought a carrot.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.620
- What?
- This isn't your toe.

18:42.788 --> 18:46.040
This is a small, very cold piece of carrot.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.376
You brought a carrot?

18:48.544 --> 18:50.336
Oh, my God.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.588
There's a toe in my kitchen.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.300
God, I'm sorry. I'll go back and get it.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.469
It's too late.
All we can do is sew up the wound.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.930
- Without my toe? I need my toe.
- Okay.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.433
No, no, no. I can go really fast.
Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.978
Oh, I'm not falling for that one.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.524
That's why I lost my toe?
Because I called you fat?

19:13.694 --> 19:16.279
I didn't mean to cut it off.
It was an accident.

19:16.446 --> 19:20.116
That's why for an entire year
people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?

19:21.243 --> 19:22.827
I'm sorry.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.288
It wasn't your whole toe.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.623
Yeah, well, I miss the tip.

19:27.791 --> 19:28.958
It's the best part.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.794
It has the nail.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.590
Chandler...

19:37.301 --> 19:38.551
Sir Limps-a-lot.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.761
I came up with that.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.891
You're a dork.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.478
- I can't believe this.
- Chandler, I said I was sorry.

19:49.646 --> 19:53.649
Yeah, well, "sorry" doesn't bring back
the little piggy that cried all the way home.

19:54.985 --> 19:58.487
I hate this stupid day
and everything about it.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.615
- I'll see you later.
- Wait, Chandler.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.158
Come here.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.119
Is there anything I can do? Anything?

20:05.829 --> 20:09.081
Yeah, just leave me alone
for a little while.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.925
Oh, I'm a duck. I go quack-quack.
I'm happy all the time.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.520
Nice try.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.522
Wait, wait, wait.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.735
- Look, Monica...
- Look.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.699
This is not gonna work.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.660
I bet this will work.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.754
You're so great. I love you.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.765
What?

21:07.933 --> 21:11.852
Nothing. I said you're so great,
and then I just stopped talking.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.815
You said you loved me.
I can't believe this.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.108
No, I didn't.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.404
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.823
You love me.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.993
No, I don't. Stop it, stop it, stop it.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.674
Gauze!

21:41.842 --> 21:45.261
Gauze!
I need to get some gauze in here!

21:45.429 --> 21:48.931
Can I please get some more gauze?

21:58.984 --> 22:01.360
This is getting ridiculous.
