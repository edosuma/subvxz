00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:27.277 --> 00:28.903


00:29.571 --> 00:32.198
-

00:32.282 --> 00:33.908


00:36.411 --> 00:38.079


00:42.625 --> 00:45.045
Are you sure this is the way out of here?

00:45.128 --> 00:46.838


00:55.930 --> 00:57.140


00:57.223 --> 01:01.019
-Oh man, are we sitting in the 4D section?

01:01.102 --> 01:05.190
I know, bro. These effects are insane.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.948
Those aren't effects. It's an earthquake!

01:22.499 --> 01:23.750
-Sissy, look out!

01:41.434 --> 01:42.769
Sissy!

01:52.237 --> 01:55.448
I got you!
Now, let's get you out of here.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.702
Oh, you scared me that time.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.037
Thanks, Dom.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.084
Bro, what have you been doing out here?

02:06.167 --> 02:09.129
Dann got reactivated along with
some of her super-soldier friends.

02:09.212 --> 02:10.588
There's more of 'em?

02:10.672 --> 02:11.673
That's what I said!

02:11.756 --> 02:14.300
And they still want to send LA
sliding into the ocean.

02:17.053 --> 02:19.305
Looks like
they're doing a pretty good job.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.851
There's two more super soldiers
with explosives running around out there.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.937
If they detonate those
along the fault line, we're done.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.192
Look out!

02:31.276 --> 02:32.485
-Run!

02:35.196 --> 02:36.114
Dom!

02:37.824 --> 02:40.827
Go stop those super soldiers. I got this!

02:51.045 --> 02:52.964
Looks like we got one device in the Hills.

02:53.047 --> 02:54.048
I'm on it.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.719
The other soldier's off the grid.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.846
He disappeared in
a different subway tunnel.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.515
Judging from the fault line,
it's probably headed west.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.725
I'm on my way!

03:08.354 --> 03:10.607
Hey, so, uh, qu-quick question.

03:11.190 --> 03:14.903
When we catch up with this guy,
uh, then what am I supposed to do?

03:14.986 --> 03:19.198
Good question. The only thing
that's stopped them so far is themselves.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.368
Yeah, and if another explosion
goes off somewhere in LA,

03:22.452 --> 03:24.954
the whole place is gonna be
shaking just like Hollywood.

03:25.038 --> 03:25.997
Or worse.

03:26.080 --> 03:26.998
-Look out!

03:33.463 --> 03:37.717
We need to stop them
without another giant explosion.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.385
Okay, but how?

03:39.469 --> 03:42.388
Echo, where did
those super soldiers come from?

03:42.472 --> 03:45.975
<i>They were in some medical pods</i>
<i>on the base until the AI woke them up.</i>

03:46.059 --> 03:48.061
The AI woke them up.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.897
So without the AI software,
they're harmless.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.440
We just need to wipe them clean.

03:52.523 --> 03:56.361
How? We tried an EMP on Dann
and she stopped for, like, a second,

03:56.444 --> 03:57.612
then she came right back.

03:57.695 --> 03:58.905
True.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.116
Wait, what did Matsuo say?

04:02.200 --> 04:06.746
Dann has a mind made of code, but
the technology corrupts her whole body.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.665
So when our EMP wiped her brain,

04:08.748 --> 04:11.417
her embedded technology
was able to reboot it.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.045
I don't know what you're saying
but it sounds promising.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.090
Matsuo controlled his technology
with meditation.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.926
We need to wipe these
super soldiers' brains clean,

04:20.009 --> 04:21.678
then replace their AI programming

04:21.761 --> 04:24.764
with something that gets them
under control before they can reboot.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.099
What do we replace it with?

04:26.182 --> 04:27.308
I'll work on that.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.395
You just get the super soldiers
to follow you back to us.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.647
-To us?
-We'll set up the attack zone.

04:32.730 --> 04:36.067
You'll have to lure them
close enough to hit them with the EMP,

04:36.150 --> 04:38.611
<i>then upload the code</i>
<i>just as their brains get wiped.</i>

04:46.744 --> 04:48.871
No, I got it!
Get Danns or whatever to you,

04:48.955 --> 04:51.374
Frostee does typing computer whatever,
then we win!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.585
I think you just forgot
one crucial piece, Toretto.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.503
What?

04:55.586 --> 04:58.047
How are we gonna get them
to follow us back to Frostee?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.340
Oh, that's the easy part.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.719
-We just have to steal their explosives.
-Oh, that's all.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.890
Aw man, look at that thing.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.936
So what do you think,
is it a '65 or a '67?

05:22.488 --> 05:25.074
You wanna focus
your limited brainpower on driving

05:25.158 --> 05:27.660
instead of trying to identify
the vintage of this car?

05:28.411 --> 05:29.704
It's a '62.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.250
You know that's a federal offense?

05:35.626 --> 05:36.461
Whoa!

05:42.133 --> 05:45.928
Please tell me the next step in
your master plan to steal this guy's bomb

05:46.012 --> 05:47.388
involves me driving.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.432
Actually, it does.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.142
Seriously?

05:51.225 --> 05:55.438
Yeah. I've got that invisibility poncho,
or light-bending cloak, or whatever.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.690
I'm gonna put that on,
and jump onto the car,

05:57.774 --> 06:01.360
then I'll snag the device and jump back
here before he ever knows what hit him.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.696
Why don't you keep driving
and I'll do the lift?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.740
I have my magnet gloves
to stick to the car.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.743
-I can wear the gloves.
-Your hands won't fit my gloves.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.661
You think your gloves will be too small?

06:11.162 --> 06:11.996
Ha ha.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.540
Put your hands up here.
Let me see those mitts.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.043
-Will you just take the wheel?

06:17.126 --> 06:17.960
Fine.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.713
So sensitive…

06:21.380 --> 06:25.885
Alright, just get me close
and watch a master at work.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.763
Yeah. I'll watch that.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.024
There you go. Door-to-door service.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.279
No!

06:46.948 --> 06:48.116
Good grief.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.034
-Come on!

06:55.873 --> 06:57.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:01.462 --> 07:03.172
Would you hurry up, Toretto?

07:06.092 --> 07:07.260
Whoo! Yeah!

07:14.642 --> 07:16.894
Extremely dangerous explosive here!

07:16.978 --> 07:18.563
Well, then get in the car!

07:23.151 --> 07:26.070
See? I told you. No problem.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.031
-Yeah, you're a regular cat burglar.
-What?

07:29.866 --> 07:32.326
I don't know how
that could have gone smoother.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.047
Can I help you?

07:52.680 --> 07:55.933
There! In five seconds,
I want you 20 feet high,

07:56.017 --> 07:57.977
dead center over the top of that car.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.398
Starting now!

08:07.445 --> 08:08.404
I'll take this.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.285
I got the football!

08:20.500 --> 08:21.709
<i>Me too, Frostee.</i>

08:21.792 --> 08:24.962
<i>And just to clarify,</i>
<i>the football is the explosive, right?</i>

08:25.046 --> 08:26.130
<i>Jeez, Toretto.</i>

08:26.214 --> 08:28.925
<i>Yes! Frostee, what's our plan?</i>

08:29.008 --> 08:30.676
We just dropped Sissy back home.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.803
I'm gonna stop
at the garage for two seconds,

08:32.887 --> 08:36.766
grab the giant EMP and a few things
I need to finish the AI reprogramming,

08:36.849 --> 08:39.560
and we'll head down to
a nice, big, isolated area,

08:39.644 --> 08:41.354
maybe the beach south of the airport.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.396
Be ready in 20 min--

08:42.480 --> 08:43.856
-Look out!

08:56.827 --> 08:58.955
Or maybe you can meet us here?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.793
You want us to meet
in the middle of a traffic jam?

09:03.876 --> 09:07.046
Hold on.
I can maybe rocket out of here.

09:07.129 --> 09:10.299
Uh, you might want to
get her to move first.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.180
I think we should exchange information.

09:16.806 --> 09:20.309
You light that rocket and she's gonna be
a very different kind of blue hair.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.227
<i>Frostee!</i>

09:25.523 --> 09:28.192
-Are we doing this plan or not?
-<i>No!</i>

09:28.276 --> 09:31.654
<i>Do not use massive explosives</i>
<i>to lure maniacal super soldiers</i>

09:31.737 --> 09:33.781
<i>into the middle of a thousand civilians!</i>

09:38.578 --> 09:41.038
<i>Layla,</i>
<i>I'm coming to grab your device.</i>

09:41.122 --> 09:42.957
<i>Echo, get the other one out of the area.</i>

09:43.040 --> 09:44.875
<i>We'll track down those soldiers later.</i>

09:47.545 --> 09:48.629
-Whoa!

09:50.840 --> 09:54.302
Uh, what if they're kinda
tracking us down instead?

09:54.385 --> 09:56.554
C-C-Can you not let him do that?

09:57.096 --> 09:59.974
Okay, another hitch.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.101
We've only got one little EMP.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.020
It's got a range of about…

10:04.103 --> 10:06.105
a ten-foot square.

10:06.188 --> 10:10.443
So you're saying we basically need to
get them into the bed of Cisco's truck.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.902
Uh, that would be great,

10:11.986 --> 10:16.032
because I'll be broadcasting
the AI replacement program via Bluetooth.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.492
Also, I don't have that program yet.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.668
Is that something
that can happen in, like, two minutes?

10:27.752 --> 10:28.919
Please say yes.

10:29.503 --> 10:32.506
Huh. I think so.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.885
Good. We're gonna be at your
little patch of traffic in about a minute.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.764
What's that?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.278
-Get him off!
-Hang on!

11:01.202 --> 11:03.454
-Frostee, get ready!

11:04.121 --> 11:05.206
Give me a minute…

11:07.291 --> 11:09.043
Layla, break left!

11:19.261 --> 11:20.096
Go!

11:21.389 --> 11:23.015
Whoa!

11:26.977 --> 11:28.604
Layla, hit me!

11:32.400 --> 11:34.151
Frostee, are you ready to go?

11:34.235 --> 11:35.319
Not quite yet.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.989
Uh, please hurry up.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.203
Hit me!

11:56.882 --> 11:58.175
Now, Frostee?

11:58.676 --> 12:00.177
Okay, I'm ready!

12:00.261 --> 12:01.470
-Now!
-Uh-oh.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.888
What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

12:02.972 --> 12:04.515
I can't set off the EMP!

12:04.598 --> 12:05.975
I'm holding a computer!

12:09.562 --> 12:10.813
Toss it here!

12:22.074 --> 12:23.659
Let's hope this works.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.330
Okay. They should have integrated
their new programming.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.889
What the heck is this?

12:44.972 --> 12:49.560
Ooh! Hamster dance!
My grandchildren love this.

12:50.686 --> 12:53.147
Uh, I'm not sure how I feel about this.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.899
You gotta work with what you got.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.571
Hey, guys? What does this mean?

13:00.654 --> 13:02.239
-It's armed!

13:02.323 --> 13:04.617
Why did you arm the bomb, Toretto?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.702
Uh, I think it happened
during the keep-away.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.162
Can we shut it down?

13:08.245 --> 13:09.872
It doesn't have a shutdown.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.958
What is with this stupid agency
and these stupid weapons?

13:13.042 --> 13:14.502
We gotta get it outta here.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.962
I'll get it out of here.
Just tell me where to go!

13:17.046 --> 13:20.508
-There's no time to get anywhere!
-There must be somewhere. Think!

13:23.260 --> 13:27.097
-Maybe an underground parking garage?
-With a building full of people on top?

13:27.181 --> 13:28.766
Guys, it's blinking faster.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.643
An abandoned building.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.186
No, no, a new building!

13:32.269 --> 13:34.688
Cleve Kelso's
new headquarters in Hollywood!

13:34.772 --> 13:37.399
It's away from the fault line
and no one has moved in yet!

13:37.483 --> 13:39.401
<i>I'm sending you coordinates, T!</i>

13:39.485 --> 13:40.444
Got it!

13:40.528 --> 13:42.196
<i>Just a half mile away.</i>

13:42.279 --> 13:45.074
<i>You got about 30 seconds</i>
<i>till that thing blows.</i>

13:45.574 --> 13:46.534
I'll make it.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.664
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

13:59.004 --> 14:00.256
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

14:00.339 --> 14:02.967
-<i>Come on!</i>
-<i>You got this, Toretto!</i>

14:19.483 --> 14:21.151
Look who's back.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.530
Dom! You got everyone out okay?

14:24.613 --> 14:25.614
What do you think?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.992
Yeah. Sorry.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.786
So this is a spymobile?

14:31.537 --> 14:34.248
You've come a long way
since fixing your engine with gum.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.334
Yeah, yeah, no,
it's got a ton of stuff it can do.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.545
It's kinda complicated, really.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.046
Oh, really?

14:41.130 --> 14:44.133
T-T-T-Toretto.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.471
What? How are you still alive?

15:28.552 --> 15:30.804
-Come on.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.443
T-To-retto-retto?

15:47.404 --> 15:49.698
I think I figured out
how to work your car.

15:49.782 --> 15:54.411
Yes! We finally fought a bad guy together!
I always wanted to do that.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.331
But did you have to
make her run into my car?

15:57.915 --> 16:01.210
That's the price you pay
for saving the world.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.802
Man, remember the first time we came here?
It seems like a million years ago.

16:09.885 --> 16:13.180
Yeah.
We've all grown and changed so much.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.683
-Really? You still like driving fast?

16:15.766 --> 16:17.226
Well, yeah.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.770
Haven't applied for
medical school or anything, right?

16:19.853 --> 16:22.439
-No.
-Frostee, drones and computers.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.150
Cisco, eating and
fixing stuff with bubble gum.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.068
And acting.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.530
Right, I forgot.
Maybe Echo here has matured a little,

16:29.613 --> 16:33.075
but the rest of you knuckleheads
seem exactly the same to me.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.535
What about you, convict?

16:34.618 --> 16:36.870
I haven't changed either. Don't need to.

16:36.954 --> 16:40.874
Oh, come on. Look at you
lounging around with your new family.

16:40.958 --> 16:44.670
Don't tell me this isn't
a whole new, like, worldview, or--

16:44.753 --> 16:46.213
Ooh! Paradigm shift.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.798
Yeah. Paradigm shift.

16:47.881 --> 16:50.718
You don't think SH1FT3R
hung out and had barbecues?

16:50.801 --> 16:53.387
Wait… You mean
we're just like SH1FT3R to you?

16:53.470 --> 16:54.346
Well, I didn't--

16:54.430 --> 16:57.683
-You're… just gonna leave us?

16:57.766 --> 16:59.685
I'm not s-saying that…

16:59.768 --> 17:00.602
Man.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.355
I thought we really were family.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.650
I guess you're the best spy of all, Layla.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.485
I never saw it coming.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.403
Yeah.

17:09.945 --> 17:13.699
Guys, come on, I-I was just joshing you.
You know I don't feel that way.

17:14.283 --> 17:17.745
Hey, it's fine. You know,
we've all been family since the beginning.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.246
You were never a part of that.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.917
-You know what? Why don't you just go.
-What? Oh, don't be like that, Toretto.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.004
Seriously. It's time to move on.

17:27.838 --> 17:32.009
We should just say goodbye and
get back to the way things used to be.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.261
-No! I don't want that!

17:34.344 --> 17:37.056
Listen, I'm sorry.
I would never do anything to hurt you.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.557
I'd be lost without y'all.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.436
I spent my whole life alone on the road,
I don't want to live that way anymore.

17:42.519 --> 17:45.022
I love you all, please don't make me go!

17:45.105 --> 17:47.775
I'm sorry!
You guys are my family, for real!

17:54.239 --> 17:55.949
See? I told you we could get her.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.367
What?

17:57.451 --> 18:00.496
Always acting so tough.
We knew you'd crack.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.665
-Y'all are jerks.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.292
We love you, too, Layla!

18:05.375 --> 18:07.920
-Yeah, come on.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.172
No. I hate y'all so much.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.174
Now we know that's not true.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.009
Whatever.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.345
Hey, we better get going.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.346
Okay,

18:17.429 --> 18:20.307
but before we head out,
we got a surprise for you.

18:20.390 --> 18:21.225
Me?

18:21.767 --> 18:24.353
R-Really? We already hazed Layla,
what else could I need?

18:24.436 --> 18:25.270
Ow.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.897
-This.

18:26.980 --> 18:27.898
What is it?

18:27.981 --> 18:31.026
-It's the deed to the garage.
-We all chipped in and bought it.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.404
Yeah, Frostee hacked the auction site,
so we got it for, like, a dollar.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.989
You didn't have to tell him that.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.407
It belongs to all of us,

18:37.991 --> 18:40.911
but we thought maybe
we'd just call it the Toretto Garage.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.789
Someplace for the whole family.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.290
Wow.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.501
I don't know what to say.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.087
Uh, say you're gonna
let me be the first client,

18:50.170 --> 18:53.257
because my truck needs
a ton of work after that last fight.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.384
You? My car got hit by a train!

18:55.968 --> 18:59.263
Uh, my minivan exploded
in an earthquake hole!

18:59.346 --> 19:02.933
We can fight about this later.
We gotta roll or we're gonna be late!

19:10.440 --> 19:13.735
-Why do we have to wear these?
-Gary said that's what she wanted.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.988
Plus, they're the only
matching outfits we have.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.781
You think he's gonna make it?

19:18.282 --> 19:21.827
He looks like he's wishing
he was back in Moray's volcano right now.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.873
Quiet, here she comes.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.177
-Aw!

19:44.016 --> 19:47.603
<i>Alright, let's make this quick.</i>
<i>I'm in a hostage negotiation.</i>

19:47.686 --> 19:51.690
Aw!
The most romantic form of espionage.

19:52.191 --> 19:56.445
What happens in Stockholm syndrome
stays in Stockholm syndrome.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.823
<i>You've got rings to exchange,</i>
<i>or whatever?</i>

20:00.324 --> 20:01.533
Oh, ring bearer!

20:03.410 --> 20:04.786
Aw!

20:04.870 --> 20:07.247
Look at that little face with the little…

20:07.331 --> 20:10.584
Who's the best ring bearer?
Are you my ring bearer?

20:12.753 --> 20:13.921
Ring bearer.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.507
I can't believe this is finally happening.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.718
You know I always get my man.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.012
Hey, that's my line.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.932
What's yours is mine, bounty man.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.478
What's going on? Are we under attack?

20:30.062 --> 20:32.981
Oh no, we weren't
supposed to be here this soon.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.026
Our target moved. He's on the run!

20:36.109 --> 20:39.404
-What are you idiots talking about?
-I'm so sorry, Ms. Nowhere.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.865
It was gonna be
your surprise wedding present.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.618
The cyber soldier
that we thought Echo blew up survived.

20:44.701 --> 20:48.413
We tracked him down and were gonna
let you capture him after the ceremony.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.249
Now everything's ruined.

20:50.332 --> 20:54.503
And here I thought we were
just up here for sentimental reasons.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.423
-You always got me, Gare Bear.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.300
Looks like we'll have to elope.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.803
-Everyone, get ready to drop!

21:04.888 --> 21:07.432
-Best wedding ever!
-Don't you need to change?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.188
Ready to take the leap?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.982
Woohoo!

21:19.611 --> 21:21.571
Launch the incendiaries.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.962
Hey! Does this mean we're spies again?

21:37.045 --> 21:39.214
Just enjoy the moment, Toretto!

21:39.298 --> 21:41.300
Woohoohoo!

21:41.383 --> 21:42.217
Yeah!

21:44.761 --> 21:47.681
-Yeah! Whoo!
-Woohoohoo!

21:47.764 --> 21:49.349
-Alright!

21:50.267 --> 21:52.311
Whoa!

21:55.897 --> 21:58.942
Last one to the super soldier buys tacos?

21:59.026 --> 22:02.362
Let's make it interesting. Last one buys…

22:02.446 --> 22:03.739
burritos!

22:03.822 --> 22:06.450
-You're on.
-I'm in.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.244
Alright. Let's race!

22:38.356 --> 22:40.275
