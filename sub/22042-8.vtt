00:00.938 --> 00:03.367
- [Gordon] Tonight on Hotel
Hell, I'm in Pipestone,

00:03.367 --> 00:05.901
Minnesota, trying to
save a Midwestern hotel

00:05.901 --> 00:08.946
from two spoiled sisters,
who are clueless owners.

00:08.946 --> 00:11.313
Did you stay here before you bought it?

00:11.313 --> 00:12.887
- Once.
- Once?

00:12.887 --> 00:13.930
- They don't know what they're doing.

00:13.930 --> 00:14.799
I do not think Vanda and Rina

00:14.799 --> 00:16.464
should be running a hotel at all.

00:16.464 --> 00:17.778
- This is what we deal with.

00:17.778 --> 00:19.884
- [Gordon] Every day is a new
battle between the owners,

00:19.884 --> 00:21.993
Vanda and Rina, and their staff.

00:21.993 --> 00:23.408
- Kill me, kill me, kill me.

00:23.408 --> 00:26.390
- Stuck in the middle of it
all, the general manager,

00:26.390 --> 00:28.215
is struggling to hold the place together.

00:28.215 --> 00:29.990
There is some much bitterness.

00:29.990 --> 00:31.948
- People are about to explode.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.794
- [Gordon] These girls
aren't running a business,

00:33.794 --> 00:36.161
they're running a
business into the ground.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.704
- If you were here for
two seconds, you'd know

00:37.704 --> 00:40.801
I've been running my ass
off for three fucking days.

00:40.801 --> 00:42.605
- [Gordon] Do daddy's little
girls have it in them,

00:42.605 --> 00:44.092
to turn this place around?

00:44.092 --> 00:44.967
(Rina sobbing)

00:44.967 --> 00:45.836
- I want this so bad.

00:47.432 --> 00:49.837
- [Gordon] Or am I already too late?

00:49.837 --> 00:51.176
- I can't do this.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.824
- It feels like I'm in a
woman's fucking prison.

00:53.824 --> 00:56.275
- I'm fucking done, I'm fucking done.

00:56.275 --> 00:57.685
You stupid bitch.

00:58.583 --> 01:01.625
(heavy rock music)

01:04.653 --> 01:06.621
(spider clattering)

01:06.621 --> 01:09.402
(fire igniting)

01:12.035 --> 01:15.337
(doors clanging shut)

01:16.893 --> 01:19.674
(tiger roaring)

01:22.466 --> 01:25.819
(electrical interference)

01:25.819 --> 01:27.577
- At the heart of Pipestone, Minnesota,

01:27.577 --> 01:31.216
stands the historic
Calumet Inn, built in 1887.

01:31.216 --> 01:34.313
Calumet is a native American
word for peace pipe.

01:34.313 --> 01:36.940
But sadly, peace is
something in short supply

01:36.940 --> 01:38.723
at the Calumet Inn.

01:38.723 --> 01:42.303
The hotel is owned by sisters,
Rina and Vanda Smrkovski.

01:43.196 --> 01:45.052
Nine months ago, their father Jim,

01:45.052 --> 01:46.471
or daddy as they call him,

01:46.471 --> 01:48.222
purchased the hotel for the sisters.

01:48.222 --> 01:50.214
- I'm not sure that Rina and Vanda realise

01:50.214 --> 01:52.132
how privileged they are.

01:52.132 --> 01:55.334
- Just because we dress nice,
doesn't mean we're spoiled.

01:55.334 --> 01:57.575
- They are definitely
a little bit spoiled.

01:59.098 --> 02:00.829
- [Gordon] Rina's not
just a little bit spoiled,

02:00.829 --> 02:02.758
she's also a little bit of a crybaby.

02:03.727 --> 02:05.323
- There's just too much
trash talking around here,

02:05.323 --> 02:08.305
and I can't work with people like that.

02:08.305 --> 02:10.223
I'm so sick of always being judged.

02:10.223 --> 02:12.754
- You're going to have
to come down to earth.

02:12.754 --> 02:15.030
(Rina sobbing)

02:15.030 --> 02:17.801
- God, I cry a lot, now
what was I crying about?

02:17.801 --> 02:19.136
I don't even know.

02:19.136 --> 02:21.141
- [Gordon] After owning the
hotel for just six weeks,

02:21.141 --> 02:22.892
Rina found working a bit much.

02:22.892 --> 02:26.990
So she took the weekend off in
Minneapolis, 200 miles away,

02:26.990 --> 02:30.817
and she didn't return for three months.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.226
While she was away, the
hotel was left at the mercy

02:33.226 --> 02:35.582
of her younger sister, Vanda.

02:35.582 --> 02:38.648
Vanda considers herself very hardworking.

02:38.648 --> 02:39.711
Although she doesn't get out of bed

02:39.711 --> 02:41.630
until three o'clock every afternoon,

02:41.630 --> 02:44.007
leaving the hotel understaffed.

02:44.007 --> 02:49.085
- A lot of times, I feel
like people come to work

02:49.085 --> 02:52.237
just to make tips and for their paycheck.

02:53.861 --> 02:56.760
And they're not necessarily here

02:56.760 --> 03:01.695
to take care of this historic artefact.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.448
- I apologise again, I'm sorry.

03:06.988 --> 03:08.024
- Thank you very much.

03:08.024 --> 03:09.220
- I do not think Vanda and Rina

03:09.220 --> 03:10.304
should be running a hotel at all,

03:10.304 --> 03:11.173
because they don't know
what they're doing,

03:11.173 --> 03:13.933
and they don't care about anybody.

03:13.933 --> 03:16.884
- [Gordon] Despite having
zero hospitality experience...

03:16.884 --> 03:17.825
- Do you know how to use this?

03:18.844 --> 03:20.836
- [Gordon] Vanda and Rina
think they know best.

03:20.836 --> 03:22.150
So they strip the general manager

03:22.150 --> 03:23.839
of all her management duties.

03:23.839 --> 03:25.299
- Before Rina and Vanda got here,

03:25.299 --> 03:27.415
I was the general manager of the Calumet.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.980
And now I'm a front desk
person and a waitress,

03:29.980 --> 03:30.898
that's what I am.

03:30.898 --> 03:32.191
I've got the chicken pita wrap.

03:32.191 --> 03:33.171
- [Client] Right here.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.391
- [Gordon] With the girls in charge,

03:34.391 --> 03:36.888
things at the hotel have
rapidly gone down hill.

03:36.888 --> 03:39.399
- Oh, that's mouldy.
- Oh, man.

03:42.931 --> 03:43.799
- Look at this!

03:43.799 --> 03:44.675
How are your allergies doing?

03:44.675 --> 03:46.552
- They're a little bit rough.

03:47.683 --> 03:48.867
- Do you need your inhaler?

03:49.875 --> 03:51.752
- [Gordon] With almost
no guests coming in,

03:51.752 --> 03:53.504
Vanda and Rina's parents have been forced

03:53.504 --> 03:55.662
to leave their family home in Minneapolis,

03:55.662 --> 03:58.144
and move into the hotel,
alongside their daughters,

03:58.144 --> 04:00.396
in a desperate attempt to cut the costs

04:00.396 --> 04:01.929
and keep the doors open.

04:01.929 --> 04:03.580
- I work seven days a week.

04:05.182 --> 04:07.041
I miss my home very much.

04:10.552 --> 04:12.888
- [Gordon] If the situation
doesn't change fast

04:12.888 --> 04:14.921
the staff will all lose their jobs.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.411
- I can't do this.

04:16.411 --> 04:18.529
This is real life, this is people's jobs.

04:18.529 --> 04:22.147
This isn't you playing,
hotel, because you're bored.

04:22.147 --> 04:23.016
- [Gordon] And the hotel

04:23.016 --> 04:24.893
will have to shut its doors forever.

04:26.120 --> 04:30.291
- If Gordon Ramsey cannot help
Rina and Vanda, nobody can.

04:30.291 --> 04:32.275
And the Calumet will close.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.265
- I'm in the middle of Minnesota,

04:36.265 --> 04:38.351
look at this place, it's like Holland.

04:38.351 --> 04:41.020
It is incredibly flat,
windmills everywhere,

04:41.020 --> 04:43.463
but no fucking tulips.

04:46.127 --> 04:47.944
Look at the size of that thing,

04:47.944 --> 04:50.558
the largest peace pipe in the world.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.394
This is it.

04:52.394 --> 04:54.972
Wow, this place is huge.

04:54.972 --> 04:57.741
It may be historic,
but look at that thing.

04:57.741 --> 05:02.114
Okay, this is the
entrance, you kidding me?

05:02.114 --> 05:04.669
This looks like the entrance
to a fucking prison,

05:04.669 --> 05:05.579
not a hotel.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.446
A prison with an ATM, my God.

05:11.446 --> 05:12.666
Hello?

05:12.666 --> 05:14.053
You're kidding me.

05:14.053 --> 05:14.922
Please come in!

05:16.116 --> 05:17.932
I can't believe it, it is so dark in here,

05:17.932 --> 05:19.454
a fucking dungeon.

05:19.454 --> 05:20.706
Hello?

05:20.706 --> 05:21.613
Sod this.

05:23.128 --> 05:25.679
I'm going to go get a light.

05:25.679 --> 05:27.601
There, that is crazy.

05:30.205 --> 05:33.291
Right, maybe it's best I turn around

05:33.291 --> 05:34.355
and fuck off home now.

05:34.355 --> 05:35.223
Hello?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.442
I feel like a goonie.

05:40.152 --> 05:42.199
Hey, you guys?

05:44.229 --> 05:46.836
(tense music)

05:49.140 --> 05:51.458
Ah, wow.

05:52.779 --> 05:53.655
Ooh, hello.

05:53.655 --> 05:54.524
- Hi.

05:54.524 --> 05:55.532
- How are you?

05:55.532 --> 05:58.379
- When I saw Gordon walk
in, I was very scared

05:58.379 --> 06:01.139
because I knew that he was
trying to check into the hotel.

06:01.139 --> 06:03.488
- Are you running this place by yourself?

06:03.488 --> 06:04.395
- Yes, today I am.

06:04.395 --> 06:05.264
- Today you are.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.846
Does anyone work in reception?

06:06.846 --> 06:08.649
- Me.
- Yeah, oh do you, really?

06:08.649 --> 06:09.518
- Yes.

06:09.518 --> 06:11.579
- So you're the server and
you're at the front desk?

06:11.579 --> 06:12.893
- Yes, my name Mandy.

06:12.893 --> 06:14.439
- Mandy, Gordon, nice to see you.

06:14.439 --> 06:15.307
- Nice to see you.
- You're busy.

06:15.307 --> 06:16.730
- Yes.
- Very busy indeed.

06:16.730 --> 06:17.711
But you've got diners to look after,

06:17.711 --> 06:19.586
maybe somebody else should check me in.

06:19.586 --> 06:20.455
- Okay.

06:20.455 --> 06:22.550
I not feel like a proper GM here.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.904
(phone ringing)

06:23.904 --> 06:24.853
- Hi, Mandy.

06:24.853 --> 06:26.063
- Hey, come down and help, please.

06:26.063 --> 06:30.379
I feel like somebody that's
here to cover the extra hours.

06:30.379 --> 06:32.893
However, I do still get to
listen to the complaints.

06:32.893 --> 06:33.762
- I don't know if you know, Mandy,

06:33.762 --> 06:35.093
but there's a bulb missing there.

06:35.093 --> 06:36.101
- Probably.
- Oh.

06:37.149 --> 06:39.097
- Jim likes to take bulbs out of things,

06:39.097 --> 06:40.775
so people can't turn lights on.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.402
- Jim likes to take bulbs?

06:42.402 --> 06:46.440
- Yes, Jim likes to take
bulbs, so take the bulb out.

06:47.726 --> 06:49.899
- This place is a mad house.

06:49.899 --> 06:51.911
- Oh, hello?
- Hi.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.066
- Finally.
- Fine and you.

06:53.066 --> 06:54.393
- And first name is?

06:54.393 --> 06:56.124
- Vanda.
- Pleased to meet you.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.028
- Likewise, Gordon, good to see you.

06:57.028 --> 06:57.897
- I'm Rina.

06:57.897 --> 06:59.081
- Rina, nice to see you.

06:59.081 --> 06:59.950
- Pleased to meet you.

06:59.950 --> 07:00.818
- Sisters?
- Yes.

07:00.818 --> 07:01.880
- And owners?
- Yes.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.748
- If you don't mind me asking,

07:02.748 --> 07:04.601
I mean, you look very young
to be running a hotel.

07:04.601 --> 07:05.941
How old are you?
- I'm 27.

07:05.941 --> 07:07.427
- Wow, baby.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.255
- I'm 32.
- Wow, babies.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.702
And you both run it together?

07:11.702 --> 07:12.571
- Yes.

07:12.571 --> 07:16.421
- So Mandy multitasks, she
does the restaurants...

07:16.421 --> 07:19.825
- She's actually the general manager.

07:19.825 --> 07:22.473
- Wow, general manager, head waitress,

07:22.473 --> 07:24.543
and she looks like a busser.

07:24.543 --> 07:26.404
- I'm not happy with her work.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.291
It's really difficult

07:27.291 --> 07:29.147
to find people who are motivated to work

07:29.147 --> 07:31.962
and who want to live up to our standards.

07:31.962 --> 07:32.911
- What room am I in?

07:32.911 --> 07:35.559
- You are in our best room.

07:35.559 --> 07:37.603
- The melody of love.

07:37.603 --> 07:39.600
Do you hear people
shagging in the next door.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.468
(girls laughing)

07:40.468 --> 07:42.045
No, you must hear something?

07:42.045 --> 07:44.238
Wow, holy mackerel.

07:45.945 --> 07:46.977
Is that mould in there?

07:46.977 --> 07:50.702
- I wouldn't be surprised
if it were mould.

07:51.815 --> 07:54.151
- And where's the wardrobe,
so I can hang my jacket up?

07:54.151 --> 07:57.240
- The wardrobe, right over right there.

07:58.201 --> 08:00.490
- It's kind of hidden behind the microwave

08:00.490 --> 08:02.221
and mouldy refrigerator.

08:02.221 --> 08:03.243
- Jesus.

08:03.243 --> 08:04.234
- I'm feeling really nervous right now.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.382
I know that the room is really cluttered,

08:06.382 --> 08:08.300
but I didn't realise it was that bad.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.333
- Well, at least we have a light bulb.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.407
There's a man that goes round

08:10.407 --> 08:11.981
nicking light bulbs out of the lamps,

08:11.981 --> 08:14.598
Mandy said that he doesn't
want them turned on,

08:14.598 --> 08:15.485
some guy called Jim.

08:15.485 --> 08:17.782
- My father tales light
bulbs out of the lamps?

08:17.782 --> 08:19.071
- He's your father?

08:19.071 --> 08:19.940
- Yeah.

08:19.940 --> 08:21.438
- Mom works in the business as well?

08:21.438 --> 08:23.367
- Our mom kind of goes around

08:23.367 --> 08:27.288
and helps clean up after people's mess.

08:27.288 --> 08:28.712
- Are they owners as well?

08:28.712 --> 08:29.711
- They're investors.

08:29.711 --> 08:30.739
- They're investors.

08:30.739 --> 08:32.323
So your parents bought you this place?

08:32.323 --> 08:33.746
- Yes

08:33.746 --> 08:35.650
- The moment we saw this
place, I knew I had to have it,

08:35.650 --> 08:39.644
so I found every single way
possible to convince my daddy.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.188
No matter what I had to
do, I just had to have it.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.460
- I personally think
they could have gotten it

08:43.460 --> 08:46.228
for cheaper and they probably should have

08:46.228 --> 08:49.498
- What do you two do all day,
if mom and dad are hands on,

08:49.498 --> 08:50.366
so what's your role?

08:50.366 --> 08:51.458
- I do the bookkeeping.

08:51.458 --> 08:53.585
I do the front desk in the evening.

08:53.585 --> 08:55.149
There was one day Gordon,

08:55.149 --> 08:58.413
I had to man the dining
room and the front desk.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.512
- Oh, where was big sis?

08:59.512 --> 09:00.623
- I don't know where you were,

09:00.623 --> 09:01.875
I think you were in
Minneapolis or something.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.098
- Minneapolis, what were
you doing back there,

09:03.098 --> 09:04.429
when you just bought a hotel?

09:04.429 --> 09:07.109
- I actually needed some time to be alone

09:07.109 --> 09:08.475
and figure things out.

09:08.475 --> 09:11.666
- So you take two weeks
away, then what happened?

09:11.666 --> 09:12.854
- She wasn't gone for two weeks,

09:12.854 --> 09:14.419
she was gone for three months.

09:15.764 --> 09:16.702
- Three months?

09:16.702 --> 09:17.766
- She was gone for three months

09:17.766 --> 09:19.486
- After being open for six weeks?

09:20.769 --> 09:23.553
I heard your role, what do you do?

09:23.553 --> 09:25.961
- I'm seriously still confused
on what my role is here.

09:25.961 --> 09:27.338
I feel like...

09:27.338 --> 09:28.568
- Shit, what?
- I don't understand...

09:28.568 --> 09:31.115
- You own the place and you
don't know what your role is?

09:32.395 --> 09:33.928
- I feel like a bunch of gas bubbles

09:33.928 --> 09:36.149
are just flying all
over, molecules and atoms

09:36.149 --> 09:38.192
just everywhere right now.

09:38.192 --> 09:40.194
- Did you stay here before you bought it?

09:40.194 --> 09:41.393
- I stayed here, um-

09:41.393 --> 09:42.947
- How many times?

09:42.947 --> 09:44.928
- Once.
- Once?

09:44.928 --> 09:46.920
- You stayed one fucking night-

09:46.920 --> 09:48.171
- Overnight.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.099
- Did you stay in here?

09:49.099 --> 09:52.060
- No, not here, in the
other room down the hall.

09:52.060 --> 09:52.999
- Show me, please.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.055
- This is actually my favourite room.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.819
- Okay, and this is it.

10:00.819 --> 10:02.248
- So we stayed in this room...

10:02.248 --> 10:03.791
- You stayed in this room.

10:03.791 --> 10:05.292
This is even worse than my room.

10:05.292 --> 10:07.107
Pee stains all over the...

10:07.107 --> 10:09.696
disgusting wallpaper,
holes in the wall here.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.550
Why is this hotel in such a state?

10:13.843 --> 10:16.223
- We have a lot of
problems with the staff.

10:16.223 --> 10:19.671
- It's so hard Gordon,
to just repeat myself.

10:19.671 --> 10:20.756
- What are the problems?

10:20.756 --> 10:23.123
- Rudeness, unprofessionalism.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.053
- There is a chronic disease here,

10:26.053 --> 10:28.743
of complaining and bitching.

10:28.743 --> 10:30.349
- So you've got a big
problem with the staff?

10:30.349 --> 10:31.527
- Yes, we do.

10:31.527 --> 10:33.039
You're welcome for the jobs.

10:33.039 --> 10:34.269
You're welcome for the tips.

10:34.269 --> 10:36.128
You're welcome, you're welcome.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.902
- [Gordon] I'm in Pipestone, Minnesota,

10:41.902 --> 10:43.998
in a place run by two spoiled sisters,

10:43.998 --> 10:46.406
whose daddy bought them a hotel.

10:46.406 --> 10:47.553
Is that mould in there?

10:47.553 --> 10:49.149
- I wouldn't be surprised.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.017
- [Gordon] They tell me,

10:50.017 --> 10:51.540
the staff are the biggest problem here...

10:51.540 --> 10:55.176
- It's so hard Gordon
to just repeat myself.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.458
- But I'm not so sure.

10:56.458 --> 10:57.720
- She wasn't gone for two weeks,

10:57.720 --> 10:59.284
she was gone for three months.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.464
- [Gordon] Hopefully, some lunch

11:02.464 --> 11:04.800
will brighten up my disappointing day.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.260
Hello, how are you?

11:06.260 --> 11:07.365
- I'm good, how are you?

11:07.365 --> 11:08.820
- Nice to meet you.

11:08.820 --> 11:10.587
- Nice to meet you, I'm Joselyn.

11:10.587 --> 11:11.455
- Joselyn, nice to see you.

11:11.455 --> 11:12.324
- Nice to meet you.

11:12.324 --> 11:13.192
- How long have you been here, my darling?

11:13.192 --> 11:14.737
- I have been here for two years.

11:14.737 --> 11:15.605
- Two years?

11:15.605 --> 11:16.895
- In June, yeah, it will be two years.

11:16.895 --> 11:18.991
- I'm sorry, two years.
- That's just, yeah.

11:18.991 --> 11:21.921
- And is your father
going to buy you a hotel?

11:21.921 --> 11:24.027
- Never gonna happen.

11:24.027 --> 11:25.696
Even if I was like, please I want it,

11:25.696 --> 11:26.592
just because I'm bored.

11:26.592 --> 11:27.468
Not going to happen.

11:27.468 --> 11:28.601
- Right, what would you recommend?

11:28.601 --> 11:29.825
- Do you want to start
with an appetiser, maybe?

11:29.825 --> 11:31.055
- Yeah, what's the soup of the day?

11:31.055 --> 11:32.348
- Broccoli, cauliflower.

11:32.348 --> 11:33.616
- Yeah, I'll try one of those.

11:33.616 --> 11:34.485
- Okay.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.675
- Entrees, let's go for the fish.

11:36.675 --> 11:37.864
The walleye strip.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.595
- Okay.

11:39.595 --> 11:41.847
- Man, it's a huge menu.

11:41.847 --> 11:43.321
How many's in the kitchen?

11:43.321 --> 11:44.214
- Two.

11:44.214 --> 11:45.559
- Two chefs.

11:45.559 --> 11:47.749
How'd you get this food fresh,

11:47.749 --> 11:48.844
with only two chefs in the kitchen

11:48.844 --> 11:51.589
and a menu with literally
35, 40 dishes on it?

11:52.691 --> 11:54.273
- You don't.

11:54.273 --> 11:56.278
- Does that need rice?

11:56.278 --> 11:58.520
Our menu here is huge.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.752
I wish we could use
better ingredients here.

12:00.752 --> 12:02.889
Vanda and Rina, they don't want to spend.

12:04.297 --> 12:08.374
- I would not spend my money
here at the restaurant.

12:08.374 --> 12:11.617
No, I think the food sucks.

12:11.617 --> 12:12.485
- How are you, Mandy?

12:12.485 --> 12:13.418
- Hi, how are you?

12:13.418 --> 12:14.317
- You're busy, you're
always running around.

12:14.317 --> 12:15.342
- Yeah.
- Amazing.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.102
How long have you been general manager?

12:18.102 --> 12:18.971
- Two years.

12:18.971 --> 12:19.839
- Two years?

12:19.839 --> 12:21.637
No disrespect, you don't
look like a general manager.

12:21.637 --> 12:23.357
- Right, I'm not that anymore.

12:23.357 --> 12:24.744
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.090
- Shit, seriously?
- Seriously.

12:27.090 --> 12:27.977
- Did you have a falling
out with them, because...?

12:27.977 --> 12:29.572
- No.
- No?

12:29.572 --> 12:31.438
- Everybody's incompetent, apparently.

12:31.438 --> 12:32.512
- Right?

12:32.512 --> 12:35.440
- I'm sick of not really
being the general manager.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.965
I kind of feel like I'm being pulled

12:36.965 --> 12:38.070
in all different directions.

12:38.070 --> 12:39.843
I don't really have a say in anything.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.417
- How would you describe the owners?

12:41.417 --> 12:43.474
- Vanda is borderline sociopath.

12:44.420 --> 12:45.505
The other one, I don't know,

12:45.505 --> 12:48.059
I can't describe her,
she's never here, so...

12:48.059 --> 12:50.426
- Wow, I appreciate
your honesty, thank you.

12:50.426 --> 12:52.022
Wow, Mandy seems pissed.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.857
I suppose, if I was
working as hard as she is

12:53.857 --> 12:55.661
and the owners thought the
staff were the problem,

12:55.661 --> 12:56.943
I'd be pissed too.

12:56.943 --> 12:57.970
Thank you.

12:57.970 --> 12:58.839
- This is the broccoli, cauliflower.

12:58.839 --> 12:59.790
- Right.

12:59.790 --> 13:00.922
- I'll get you your drink.

13:00.922 --> 13:02.921
- Thank you, thank you.

13:04.145 --> 13:06.144
- Hmm, it smells burnt.

13:10.328 --> 13:12.500
Ah, that's fucking burnt.

13:15.389 --> 13:19.156
So sorry, taste it, just a small bit.

13:20.493 --> 13:21.622
- Ugh, uh-uh.

13:24.936 --> 13:28.245
- It is absolutely, fucking disgusting.

13:28.245 --> 13:29.459
Does the chef not care?

13:29.459 --> 13:30.567
- Hmm...

13:30.567 --> 13:31.436
- No?
- No.

13:32.678 --> 13:34.919
I don't think the cooks care anymore.

13:34.919 --> 13:37.674
But I feel like a lot of us
have gotten to that point.

13:39.058 --> 13:40.883
- Okay, walleye fish strip.

13:40.883 --> 13:43.269
- [Joselyn] Which isn't
a strip, it's like a ball

13:43.269 --> 13:44.887
- Honestly, how hard is that thing?

13:44.887 --> 13:46.524
- [Joselyn] I've never had
it, because I don't like it.

13:46.524 --> 13:47.733
- Is it fresh or frozen?

13:47.733 --> 13:49.204
- [Joselyn] Frozen,
but it looks like crap,

13:49.204 --> 13:50.514
so I wouldn't eat it.

13:50.514 --> 13:52.099
- Jesus Christ.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.493
(knife hammering)

13:54.493 --> 13:55.531
Now, that's what it takes...

13:55.531 --> 13:56.676
- Yeah!

13:56.676 --> 13:58.445
Yeah, no, disgusting.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.041
I mean, what's wrong with
this place, what's...

14:04.041 --> 14:04.910
- Everything.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.805
- Who's the most assertive
out of the sisters?

14:06.805 --> 14:08.796
- Vanda, because Rina's not here.

14:08.796 --> 14:09.766
- No.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.935
How committed are they
to running the business?

14:11.935 --> 14:13.186
- Don't care.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.416
I think they look at it as,

14:14.416 --> 14:17.294
like well I own it, so we
can do whatever we want.

14:17.294 --> 14:18.650
Sleep till three in the afternoon.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.600
Keep the bar open till
five in the morning.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.216
I mean, how do you respect
somebody who does that?

14:22.216 --> 14:24.333
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.303
Can you get me the owners and the chefs?

14:26.303 --> 14:27.172
- Yeah.
- Thank you, darling.

14:27.172 --> 14:28.618
- You're welcome.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.380
- [Narrator] The food here is horrific.

14:30.380 --> 14:32.622
It's as if the chef is
cooking in her sleep.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.801
- Gordon wants to talk to you guys.

14:34.801 --> 14:36.751
- Now you don't need me here, to tell you,

14:36.751 --> 14:38.003
the soup is that disgusting,

14:38.003 --> 14:41.131
that even before anybody
tasting it, it smells burnt.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.486
- This is why we make our own food.

14:42.486 --> 14:44.512
- I don't eat here anymore.

14:46.021 --> 14:46.890
- Unbelievable!

14:49.087 --> 14:51.144
Right now, I've got no idea,

14:51.144 --> 14:52.854
what the hell is going on here.

14:52.854 --> 14:56.097
Have you given up young
lady, do you hate food?

14:58.273 --> 14:59.141
What's going on?

15:00.859 --> 15:03.281
- I used to love my
job, and now I hate it.

15:05.499 --> 15:06.646
- I can see.

15:06.646 --> 15:08.189
What's not working for you?

15:08.189 --> 15:09.367
- The owners.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.511
- I'm not going to tolerate disrespect.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.568
You know, we're not getting paid,

15:12.568 --> 15:13.455
we're not paying ourselves!

15:13.455 --> 15:16.395
- You can't as owners,
complain about not being paid,

15:16.395 --> 15:18.793
you fucking own the place.

15:18.793 --> 15:22.321
They don't have ownership
of this historic building.

15:23.412 --> 15:25.498
Their daddy's not paying for everything.

15:26.687 --> 15:28.511
- Can I tell you something, Gordon?

15:29.982 --> 15:32.494
Jen has called herself
the best cook in town.

15:32.494 --> 15:33.697
She has told us over...

15:33.697 --> 15:34.653
- Stop picking on her!

15:34.653 --> 15:39.505
You have turned every fucking
member of staff against you.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.881
- I used to be really chirpy and happy,

15:43.881 --> 15:47.228
and I can't even smile anymore.

15:47.228 --> 15:48.719
- It's not about you.

15:48.719 --> 15:51.107
- Yeah and I can't even motivate myself

15:51.107 --> 15:52.421
to do my projects anymore.

15:52.421 --> 15:55.959
- Again, just listen to both of you!

15:55.959 --> 15:57.120
- Kill me, kill me, kill me.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.429
- You're only as good as
the team underneath you.

16:00.429 --> 16:02.389
Whether you're here three
months a fucking year

16:02.389 --> 16:04.542
or three hours a day, it doesn't matter.

16:04.542 --> 16:06.453
- Yeah, yeah.

16:06.453 --> 16:08.416
(dramatic music)

16:08.416 --> 16:09.326
- Grow up!

16:15.277 --> 16:16.705
- [Gordon] People have
heard that I'm in Pipestone,

16:16.705 --> 16:18.030
Minnesota's Calumet Inn.

16:18.030 --> 16:19.750
- I wonder if you have any openings?

16:19.750 --> 16:20.623
- Ah, yes.

16:20.623 --> 16:24.015
- [Gordon] And the hotel is
starting to fill up with guests.

16:24.015 --> 16:25.746
- Look at the hole in the door.

16:25.746 --> 16:27.663
- [Gordon] I feel sorry for all of them.

16:27.663 --> 16:30.062
- The sheets are kind of dirty there.

16:30.062 --> 16:31.843
- The wallpaper's hideous.

16:31.843 --> 16:33.712
- Well, the first time my pasta was burnt,

16:33.712 --> 16:35.245
I purposely got the same thing

16:35.245 --> 16:37.956
to see if it was any better, and it's not.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.416
- Very sorry about the wait.

16:41.428 --> 16:42.297
- Where am I?

16:42.297 --> 16:44.567
Oh my God, oh sorry.

16:44.567 --> 16:45.435
- Jesus, you all right?

16:45.435 --> 16:46.304
Would you like some help?

16:46.304 --> 16:47.528
- No, I got it, thank you.

16:47.528 --> 16:48.769
- How many tables have
you got left to serve?

16:48.769 --> 16:51.307
- At least two, three, four, five, yeah,

16:51.307 --> 16:52.175
it looks like.

16:52.175 --> 16:53.044
- Five?

16:53.044 --> 16:55.046
The size of the menu, two
cooks behind the line,

16:55.046 --> 16:55.914
I mean...

16:55.914 --> 16:57.100
- Ridiculous.
- I don't get it.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.747
I mean, honestly, I don't
know how any standard

16:58.747 --> 17:00.843
could be kept, I don't get it.

17:00.843 --> 17:02.084
- [Narrator] With the place this busy,

17:02.084 --> 17:04.973
it should be all hands
on deck, but it's not.

17:04.973 --> 17:05.953
- Where's Rina?

17:05.953 --> 17:07.746
- I think she's in the office.

17:07.746 --> 17:08.893
- No, she's not there.

17:10.415 --> 17:13.108
(Rina sobbing)

17:13.983 --> 17:17.141
Fucking hell, the place is massive.

17:17.141 --> 17:19.549
- [Rina] I want to volunteer,
I want to help people,

17:19.549 --> 17:20.695
I want to just do good things.

17:20.695 --> 17:21.948
- Rina, are you up here?

17:23.227 --> 17:24.387
You okay?

17:24.387 --> 17:25.256
- Yeah.

17:26.327 --> 17:27.276
Hi.

17:27.276 --> 17:28.433
- Can I come in?

17:28.433 --> 17:30.480
- Yeah.
- Wow.

17:32.125 --> 17:32.993
Is this your bedroom?

17:32.993 --> 17:34.582
- Hi.
- This is my mom.

17:34.582 --> 17:36.786
- You're Rina's mum, great to meet you.

17:36.786 --> 17:37.879
- [Rita] Pleased to meet you.

17:37.879 --> 17:38.748
- Your first name is?
- Rita.

17:38.748 --> 17:39.616
- Rita.

17:41.238 --> 17:42.228
Are you okay?

17:42.228 --> 17:43.634
- I'm okay.

17:43.634 --> 17:46.194
- But you look like you've
been crying for the last hour.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.840
- I just didn't feel like
being around people right now,

17:49.840 --> 17:50.831
I guess.

17:50.831 --> 17:54.953
- Rita, does she always run
away when things get hard?

17:56.597 --> 17:57.466
- Yeah.

18:00.945 --> 18:03.604
- What's become very obvious,

18:03.604 --> 18:06.419
is the lack of commitment.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.265
- I feel like we should
have purchased a duplex

18:08.265 --> 18:09.464
or something like that.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.937
- It's a bit late to think that now.

18:13.937 --> 18:16.805
- I just can't seem to get
up and do what I have to do.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.475
- Are you capable of
holding the reins here?

18:20.475 --> 18:23.332
- I want to start taking
control, but I need room to grow,

18:23.332 --> 18:25.327
I need space for me to take charge.

18:26.252 --> 18:28.684
- You need to get a grip.

18:29.630 --> 18:30.652
How about getting changed

18:30.652 --> 18:33.627
and coming downstairs and
just facing the music.

18:35.592 --> 18:36.825
- I can do that.

18:36.825 --> 18:37.794
- Thank you.

18:37.794 --> 18:38.931
- Thank you.

18:38.931 --> 18:41.267
- While Rina's been upstairs
crying about nothing,

18:41.267 --> 18:44.217
her guests downstairs have
every reason to be upset.

18:44.217 --> 18:45.497
- How was your chicken?

18:45.497 --> 18:47.419
- It was really dry.

18:47.419 --> 18:48.287
It was kind of,

18:48.287 --> 18:51.464
honestly one of the driest
chicken burgers I've ever had.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.831
- She can bring the check, I'll be happy.

18:53.831 --> 18:56.156
- This place is a train wreck.

18:56.156 --> 18:57.960
- All right and the
coffee's complimentary.

18:57.960 --> 18:58.829
- Oh, that's wonderful.

18:58.829 --> 19:00.064
- And they will bring you
up a pot to your room.

19:00.064 --> 19:01.485
- Thank you very much.

19:01.485 --> 19:02.353
- You're welcome.

19:02.353 --> 19:04.790
- Vanda and Rina might not treat
her like a general manager,

19:04.790 --> 19:06.250
but Mandy sure works like one.

19:06.250 --> 19:07.459
Can we just have a little word

19:07.459 --> 19:08.669
down at the end of the
dining room together,

19:08.669 --> 19:09.538
two minutes.

19:09.538 --> 19:12.072
- I want to tell Gordon
if things don't change

19:12.072 --> 19:14.102
nobody's going to be here,

19:14.102 --> 19:15.530
the Calumet will close.

19:15.530 --> 19:18.252
- You strike me as the owner,
because you are so busy.

19:18.252 --> 19:21.265
Every time I see you,
you're running in the bar,

19:21.265 --> 19:23.395
in the lounge, in the
reception, in the kitchen.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.664
- I hate unhappy customers, I hate that.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.255
- I can see how much it means to you.

19:27.255 --> 19:30.181
The two owners, do they know
that you can run this place?

19:30.181 --> 19:32.411
- No, we are all incompetent to them.

19:32.411 --> 19:35.519
- Wow, what frustrates you
most about the two sisters?

19:35.519 --> 19:39.419
- Vanda is a micromanager,
she's very cynical.

19:39.419 --> 19:41.838
She doesn't even get up off
her ass and help if it's busy,

19:41.838 --> 19:43.245
she doesn't care.

19:43.245 --> 19:46.040
Well, this is what makes
my house payment, I do.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.886
And Rina is a pansy, I can't stand her.

19:48.886 --> 19:51.392
- What is Rina good at doing?

19:52.713 --> 19:53.850
- Cry.

19:53.850 --> 19:54.718
- No.

19:57.133 --> 19:59.720
Are they qualified to run this business?

19:59.720 --> 20:02.577
- No, they should go out and
work in the real world first.

20:02.577 --> 20:03.446
- And the rest of the staff,

20:03.446 --> 20:05.372
your team that work under you,

20:05.372 --> 20:08.531
there is so much bitterness
towards the owners,

20:08.531 --> 20:09.803
has this been building up?

20:09.803 --> 20:11.576
- People are about to explode.

20:11.576 --> 20:14.120
The biggest problem at the
hotel is the ownership.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.268
Who we're supposed to respect,

20:16.268 --> 20:18.280
ultimately doesn't respect us.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.917
And I think that makes people

20:20.835 --> 20:22.847
really not want to be a part of this team.

20:22.847 --> 20:27.414
- The only shining light in
this building right now, is you.

20:27.414 --> 20:31.139
Because if you weren't
here, they'd be fucked.

20:31.139 --> 20:33.038
Thank you.
- All right.

20:33.038 --> 20:34.633
- Thank you, folks.

20:34.633 --> 20:35.540
- Thank you.
- Goodnight.

20:35.540 --> 20:38.300
- [Gordon] I don't think
Vanda and Rina have a clue

20:38.300 --> 20:40.344
about how much they've
really upset their staff,

20:40.344 --> 20:42.992
where their absences and
their high-handed behaviour.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.526
I need to get the staff
and the owners in one room

20:45.526 --> 20:47.977
and try to get them to communicate.

20:47.977 --> 20:50.792
Okay, when was the last time
all of you had a meeting?

20:50.792 --> 20:52.585
- When we first purchased this place.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.962
- So nine months ago.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.568
- Uh-huh.

20:55.568 --> 20:58.133
- We're just so burnt out, Gordon.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.321
- So are we.

20:59.321 --> 21:00.190
- First of all you guys,

21:00.190 --> 21:01.636
I think you guys need to understand,

21:01.636 --> 21:04.681
that we live like in four corner walls

21:04.681 --> 21:06.620
and we have no escape, we're living...

21:06.620 --> 21:08.330
- Nobody made you stay and live here.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.199
- You know what?

21:09.199 --> 21:10.989
I think we know what the problem is.

21:10.989 --> 21:12.564
We stepped in their territory

21:12.564 --> 21:14.618
and they cannot let go of their ego.

21:14.618 --> 21:18.455
- Here's the problem, if
you all fucking got to work,

21:18.455 --> 21:21.531
I wouldn't be so fucking mad all the time.

21:21.531 --> 21:24.722
I know one thing, that I
come to work and I do my job,

21:24.722 --> 21:26.515
where the fuck are you?

21:26.515 --> 21:29.059
- Mandy, what kind of effect
does it have on the team,

21:29.059 --> 21:32.073
when you can't get a
word from your owners?

21:32.073 --> 21:33.063
- It's really annoying.

21:33.063 --> 21:35.264
It's passive aggressive behaviour.

21:35.264 --> 21:37.881
It makes people just very, you know,

21:37.881 --> 21:39.226
they don't want to talk to you then, fine,

21:39.226 --> 21:41.124
you don't want to talk to
us, we want to talk to you.

21:41.124 --> 21:44.387
- There's attitude, but when
we do, there's attitude.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.931
- First of all, that shit
starts with you two then.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.568
- See, that's fine, no emotion.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.967
- I'm just, I want
people who are committed.

21:50.967 --> 21:51.835
- Committed?

21:51.835 --> 21:54.022
Fuck you, I've been here
for three and a half years,

21:54.022 --> 21:56.399
I've done everything from
bar tending the fucking pub,

21:56.399 --> 21:59.027
to housekeeping, to
front desk, to serving.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.966
- We want to know that
you're going to be here,

22:00.966 --> 22:01.835
that's the thing

22:01.835 --> 22:04.313
- Oh, fuck off, I'm fucking done.

22:04.313 --> 22:06.086
I'm fucking done, fuck off.

22:06.086 --> 22:09.249
Committed, you stupid
bitch, you just got here.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.124
I work 65 fucking hours a week,

22:13.124 --> 22:14.772
sometimes 70 and I have two fucking kids,

22:14.772 --> 22:15.658
I'm a single fucking mom.

22:15.658 --> 22:18.925
- It feels like I'm in a
woman's fucking prison.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.376
- I'm leaving, I'm done.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.423
- [Gordon] I'm trying to save Pipestone,

22:30.423 --> 22:33.342
Minnesota's Calumet Inn, but Mandy,

22:33.342 --> 22:35.146
the general manager of three years...

22:35.146 --> 22:39.077
The only shining light in this
building right now is you.

22:39.077 --> 22:40.714
- Oh, fuck off!

22:40.714 --> 22:42.028
- [Gordon] Has just quit her job.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.759
- I'm fucking done, fuck off.

22:43.759 --> 22:46.651
Committed, you stupid
bitch, you just got here.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.828
(dramatic music)

22:51.830 --> 22:55.156
- I know a lot of people
feel that if Mandy's gone,

22:55.156 --> 22:56.825
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone.

22:56.825 --> 22:58.159
I mean, this is getting real ugly.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.602
- Our general manager has just walked out.

23:01.703 --> 23:02.572
- Do you know what the funny thing is?

23:02.572 --> 23:05.281
- No, no, no, listen, it's not funny,

23:05.281 --> 23:10.494
that girl dedicated her life,
to keeping you in a hotel.

23:11.652 --> 23:15.374
Have you ever employed one
single member of staff?

23:15.374 --> 23:17.897
- Like she even worked a day in her life.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.372
- How could you say that, Jen?

23:19.372 --> 23:21.574
- You can't say that,
you don't know me at all.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.038
- If you were here for
two seconds, you'd know

23:23.038 --> 23:25.758
I've been running my ass
off for three fucking days.

23:25.758 --> 23:27.522
- You guys don't see me do
these things, but I do them,

23:27.522 --> 23:28.585
but you guys don't see it.

23:28.585 --> 23:31.332
You don't know the life
behind all, you have no clue.

23:31.332 --> 23:34.810
(all girls shouting)

23:34.810 --> 23:36.489
- For fuck's sake.

23:36.489 --> 23:38.564
One of you step up.

23:38.564 --> 23:42.050
If you were my daughters,
I'd kick you out.

23:44.778 --> 23:46.780
You can laugh all you fucking want,

23:46.780 --> 23:48.407
I'm not your father.

23:48.407 --> 23:52.797
But what I do know is, you
don't fucking deserve this.

23:52.797 --> 23:55.247
Thank you for the first
meeting in nine months.

23:56.770 --> 23:59.168
- I thought Gordon was
going to be nice to me.

24:06.023 --> 24:06.967
- That was extraordinary,

24:06.967 --> 24:09.824
the only person who actually
cared about this place,

24:09.824 --> 24:12.827
Mandy, the general manager, has gone.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.646
Those daughters are absolutely screwed.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.117
(birds tweeting)

24:22.274 --> 24:23.369
- [Gordon] I had a dreadful sleep,

24:23.369 --> 24:25.538
I need to get some exercise,
to burn off some of the tension

24:25.538 --> 24:28.194
from all that screaming last night.

24:28.194 --> 24:29.114
- Hi, good morning, darling.

24:29.114 --> 24:30.051
- Hi, how are you?

24:30.051 --> 24:30.950
- I'm well thanks, how are you?

24:30.950 --> 24:32.104
- I'm good.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.138
- God, it was a rough night, that one.

24:34.138 --> 24:37.695
I want to go to the gym and
do some workout and swim.

24:37.695 --> 24:38.563
- Okay.

24:38.563 --> 24:40.052
- What floor is it on?

24:40.052 --> 24:42.263
- It's not, we don't
have one in the building.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.775
There's one right over there.

24:45.276 --> 24:46.145
Yeah.

24:47.882 --> 24:49.082
- Over where?

24:49.082 --> 24:51.741
- Right over here, like down this street,

24:51.741 --> 24:53.191
it's like a rec centre.

24:53.191 --> 24:54.883
- So I have to go out of the hotel?

24:59.781 --> 25:01.167
Fuck this, no chance!

25:01.167 --> 25:03.809
This is all ridiculous, sod that.

25:03.809 --> 25:06.548
A hotel this size, with no gym on site,

25:06.548 --> 25:08.602
is just another example of Vanda and Rina

25:08.602 --> 25:10.896
forgetting who's most
important around here.

25:12.189 --> 25:13.711
- Hey, Gordon.
- Good morning.

25:13.711 --> 25:14.869
Let's have a little catch up.

25:14.869 --> 25:18.197
Hopefully today, I can
finally get through to them.

25:18.197 --> 25:19.065
Good morning.

25:22.877 --> 25:25.942
These are some of your guests.

25:25.942 --> 25:29.435
All I'd like to hear, is just
nothing but the plain truth.

25:29.435 --> 25:33.825
And give these owners an insight
to what you're paying for.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.308
Sir, let's start with you.

25:35.308 --> 25:39.310
- I'll tell you the room
was very disappointing.

25:39.310 --> 25:41.979
We look for historic
buildings when we go places,

25:41.979 --> 25:43.189
and this was just a shame.

25:43.189 --> 25:44.575
It was like it was neglected.

25:44.575 --> 25:46.150
- It was run down down to the ground,

25:46.150 --> 25:47.592
before we purchased this place.

25:47.592 --> 25:49.052
- [Vanda] For about 10 years.
- [Rina] For 10 years.

25:49.052 --> 25:51.488
- You've got to stop blaming people.

25:51.488 --> 25:52.357
Madam, please,

25:52.357 --> 25:53.866
can you give us an insight
to your experience.

25:53.866 --> 25:56.431
- Well, when we came in, we
actually came in the back way.

25:56.431 --> 25:57.849
This dark hallway, where there's...

25:57.849 --> 25:58.994
- It's like a dungeon.

25:58.994 --> 25:59.882
- Yeah, a dungeon.

25:59.882 --> 26:00.751
- Yeah, I entered that way.

26:00.751 --> 26:03.448
I mean, it was like coming
through an entrance to a prison.

26:03.448 --> 26:04.317
- Yeah.

26:05.805 --> 26:06.681
- Madam, please.

26:06.681 --> 26:09.444
- I have severe asthma and allergies,

26:09.444 --> 26:11.060
dusting the top of the doorways,

26:11.060 --> 26:14.058
and it's just caked in white dust.

26:14.058 --> 26:15.752
- Oh, my God.

26:15.752 --> 26:17.337
- It went beyond a comfort issue,

26:17.337 --> 26:19.843
this went to a health hazard issue.

26:22.155 --> 26:24.730
I was literally worried
about my fiance's safety.

26:24.730 --> 26:25.971
And the last thing this place needs

26:25.971 --> 26:28.748
is some kind of, you know,
wrongful death liability.

26:29.948 --> 26:30.904
- Oh, gosh.

26:32.655 --> 26:36.388
- Would any of you come back to stay here?

26:36.388 --> 26:37.354
- Absolutely not.

26:38.874 --> 26:40.793
- Not one of you?

26:40.793 --> 26:41.662
Thank you.

26:41.662 --> 26:43.541
- Thank you, guys.

26:43.541 --> 26:46.199
- Take care, thank you, I'm so sorry.

26:46.199 --> 26:48.316
The complaints from
guests are obvious things

26:48.316 --> 26:50.284
that a hotel owner
should be taking care of,

26:50.284 --> 26:53.697
but these girls haven't got
a clue, or a general manager.

26:53.697 --> 26:54.565
Do you honestly think

26:54.565 --> 26:57.753
that you are capable
of running this hotel?

26:57.753 --> 26:59.296
- When I want something bad enough,

26:59.296 --> 27:00.693
and when I have my mind up to it,

27:00.693 --> 27:03.342
I always, I always accomplish.

27:03.342 --> 27:05.448
- At 32 years of age,

27:05.448 --> 27:08.075
tell me one thing that you've
accomplished in your life,

27:08.075 --> 27:08.944
on your own.

27:15.162 --> 27:18.443
- I worked when I was
14 at a fast food place.

27:19.931 --> 27:21.610
- Are you serious?

27:21.610 --> 27:23.560
You want me to get impressed with that?

27:23.560 --> 27:26.354
- No, no, but I'm just saying...

27:26.354 --> 27:30.025
- Vanda, do you honestly think
that you and your big sister

27:30.025 --> 27:32.590
are capable of running this hotel?

27:32.590 --> 27:37.803
- I want to say yes, but
just my head says, no.

27:40.328 --> 27:44.873
(Rina bursting into tears)

27:44.873 --> 27:47.636
- I feel like a knife has
just been run into my heart,

27:47.636 --> 27:49.693
but I can run this place by myself.

27:51.577 --> 27:52.849
- You have to be honest with yourself.

27:52.849 --> 27:53.965
- I think we can make it

27:53.965 --> 27:56.124
with the positive
reinforcement that I use.

27:56.124 --> 27:56.992
- Oh, God!

27:56.992 --> 27:58.272
- I would shit myself,

27:58.272 --> 28:02.557
asking you to run my dog up
the hill, let alone a hotel.

28:02.557 --> 28:05.425
(dramatic music)

28:07.656 --> 28:09.689
- [Narrator] Pipestone,
Minnesota's Calumet Inn,

28:09.689 --> 28:11.378
is in a dreadful state.

28:11.378 --> 28:12.348
The food is awful...

28:12.348 --> 28:15.095
- It is absolutely, fucking disgusting.

28:15.095 --> 28:15.963
- Oh, gross!

28:15.963 --> 28:17.218
- And the rooms are just as bad.

28:17.218 --> 28:19.671
- Oh, that's mouldy.
- Oh, man.

28:20.726 --> 28:22.942
- And the owners are totally useless.

28:22.942 --> 28:24.934
I would shit myself

28:24.934 --> 28:28.993
asking you to run my dog up
the hill, let alone a hotel.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.077
There's only one person

28:33.077 --> 28:35.757
that could help me save this place...

28:35.757 --> 28:38.600
Unless I can convince Mandy to come back

28:38.600 --> 28:40.637
and take on the role as a general manager.

28:40.637 --> 28:45.527
Then quite frankly, Rina
and Vanda are screwed.

28:45.527 --> 28:48.533
And I'll tell them to
close the hotel tonight.

28:52.004 --> 28:55.829
(knocking) Hi, darling,
have you got two minutes?

28:57.271 --> 28:58.834
You had every right to walk out,

28:58.834 --> 28:59.703
how are you feeling?

28:59.703 --> 29:01.505
- Bitter, but I'm okay.

29:01.505 --> 29:03.232
- Life's too short.
- I'll get over it.

29:03.232 --> 29:04.101
- Watching the way you work,

29:04.101 --> 29:05.631
and the way you feel for the place,

29:05.631 --> 29:08.480
and how much energy you
put in to that hotel,

29:09.520 --> 29:13.117
you are a bloody good general manager.

29:13.117 --> 29:15.104
- Thank you.
- You know your job.

29:15.104 --> 29:16.235
- Thank you.

29:16.235 --> 29:19.686
- If you were given the
absolute control of that place,

29:19.686 --> 29:20.555
to run it,

29:23.412 --> 29:24.455
would you come back?

29:26.216 --> 29:28.476
- Hm, that's tough.

29:28.476 --> 29:30.075
I just, I don't like them.

29:31.730 --> 29:32.598
- I know.

29:32.598 --> 29:33.982
- And after everything that's been said,

29:33.982 --> 29:38.080
I don't, I mean, I, I don't know.

29:38.080 --> 29:41.128
I just, I don't know.

29:42.918 --> 29:45.525
- If I was Mandy, I don't
know what I'd do either.

29:46.526 --> 29:49.490
Take care and please, think about it.

29:56.348 --> 29:58.892
I really don't know what's
going to happen at this hotel.

29:58.892 --> 30:01.405
Are Rina and Vanda capable of change?

30:01.405 --> 30:02.427
Do they have it in them,

30:02.427 --> 30:04.909
to shoulder the
responsibility of this hotel?

30:04.909 --> 30:07.154
I need to have a proper
chat with their mum.

30:08.748 --> 30:09.705
(Gordon knocking)

30:09.705 --> 30:12.114
- Yeah?
- Hello?

30:12.114 --> 30:12.982
- Come in.

30:16.086 --> 30:17.004
Hi.

30:17.004 --> 30:20.080
- It smells incredible up there.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.125
- Come on in.

30:21.125 --> 30:21.993
- What are you cooking?

30:21.993 --> 30:23.219
- I am cooking green curry.

30:23.219 --> 30:24.699
- It smells incredible.

30:24.699 --> 30:27.098
And who's whose recipes are these?

30:27.098 --> 30:28.923
- Oh, I just make up.

30:29.834 --> 30:31.744
- Do you mind if I have a little taste?

30:31.744 --> 30:33.179
- Yup, sure.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.717
A little bit spicy, maybe?

30:34.717 --> 30:35.814
- No, that's perfect.

30:35.814 --> 30:37.900
That is absolutely perfect, my God, hmm.

30:39.235 --> 30:40.475
- Wow, that is delicious,

30:40.475 --> 30:43.645
that's the tastiest food I've
eaten, since I've been here.

30:43.645 --> 30:44.792
- Thank you.

30:44.792 --> 30:49.005
- Amazing, you're a very, very good cook.

30:49.005 --> 30:51.215
How many times a week do
you cook for your daughters?

30:51.215 --> 30:53.155
- Seven days a week. (laughing)

30:53.155 --> 30:54.823
- Those babies need to grow up.

30:54.823 --> 30:56.533
- Yeah, I know that.

30:56.533 --> 30:57.982
I spoil them.

30:57.982 --> 31:00.061
- When was the last time you had a break?

31:02.234 --> 31:04.732
- Not really, not at all.

31:07.252 --> 31:09.755
Sometimes I get frustrated, I tell them,

31:09.755 --> 31:12.114
you need to do the work now by yourself.

31:13.435 --> 31:14.947
- [Gordon] Rina and
Vanda treat their mother

31:14.947 --> 31:16.313
as their personal chef,

31:16.313 --> 31:19.233
so she's stuck at the hotel,
working seven days a week.

31:19.233 --> 31:21.037
It's time the girls grew up.

31:21.037 --> 31:24.387
I wanted to talk to all four
of you, to shed some light.

31:25.541 --> 31:28.555
If you want to teach your
daughters responsibility,

31:28.555 --> 31:31.568
like I have to as a father
with three daughters,

31:31.568 --> 31:33.236
I'd buy them a fucking goldfish,

31:34.832 --> 31:35.742
not a hotel.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.055
Jim, do you want to be here?

31:39.993 --> 31:42.676
- I wouldn't want to stay
here on a permanent basis.

31:43.841 --> 31:44.709
- Rita?

31:45.824 --> 31:49.342
- No.
- No.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.949
Vanda, do you want to be here?

31:53.979 --> 31:55.196
- No, I don't.

31:57.544 --> 31:58.413
- Rina?

31:59.374 --> 32:01.611
- I'm not happy here.

32:01.611 --> 32:02.862
I'm not, I'll be honest.

32:03.777 --> 32:04.928
- That's not what I'm asking, my darling.

32:04.928 --> 32:08.358
I'm asking you, do you want to be here?

32:11.035 --> 32:11.903
- No.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.298
- I don't think you do either.

32:14.298 --> 32:15.643
You need to go back to Minneapolis,

32:15.643 --> 32:17.639
you need to get into the city.

32:17.639 --> 32:18.629
That's what you need to do.

32:18.629 --> 32:23.842
- Thank you, that's all I want. (crying)

32:25.480 --> 32:28.087
I want that so bad, thank you.

32:33.200 --> 32:36.223
I'm sorry, this is just something
I've been afraid to say.

32:38.906 --> 32:39.928
- [Gordon] Each one of you

32:39.928 --> 32:43.025
are actually trapped inside this hotel.

32:43.025 --> 32:44.401
- What do we do?

32:44.401 --> 32:48.879
- I would like you to decide as a family.

32:48.879 --> 32:50.022
Do you want a proper general manager

32:50.022 --> 32:51.648
to run the hotel for you,

32:51.648 --> 32:53.966
or do you want to sell
it, or shut it down?

32:54.891 --> 32:56.038
The decision is yours.

32:57.834 --> 33:00.701
(dramatic music)

33:02.673 --> 33:03.541
- [Narrator] Coming up,

33:03.541 --> 33:04.953
the family has come to a decision

33:04.953 --> 33:06.434
about whether to close the doors

33:06.434 --> 33:09.051
of this historic Calumet Inn.

33:09.051 --> 33:10.344
- I'm very sorry...

33:12.706 --> 33:16.355
(electrical interference)

33:18.425 --> 33:19.436
- [Narrator] The owners of Pipestone,

33:19.436 --> 33:21.564
Minnesota's historic Calumet Inn,

33:21.564 --> 33:24.598
have made a decision, about
whether to shut the hotel down,

33:24.598 --> 33:28.226
sell it, or get a proper general
manager to run it for them.

33:28.226 --> 33:31.678
- I have no idea what's
going to happen, I'm nervous.

33:31.678 --> 33:34.827
I'm very sorry for the way that
you guys have been treated.

33:34.827 --> 33:37.924
- And we have made a decision here

33:37.924 --> 33:40.012
that will turn this place around.

33:43.432 --> 33:48.549
And that means us stepping
out of the picture.

33:48.549 --> 33:53.450
- Tomorrow, there is going to
be a new general manager here.

33:53.450 --> 33:54.711
Somebody actually in charge,

33:54.711 --> 33:57.089
someone with the
authority from the owners,

33:57.089 --> 33:59.229
to run this place on their behalf.

34:00.498 --> 34:02.792
Stay there, let me get
them for you, please.

34:05.931 --> 34:07.474
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:07.474 --> 34:11.918
let me introduce you to the
Calumet's new general manager.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.327
Good to see you, say hello to your team.

34:16.327 --> 34:18.485
- After talking with Gordon, I realised,

34:18.485 --> 34:21.165
everybody that works there,
is like my second family.

34:21.165 --> 34:22.958
I care too much about the Calumet,

34:22.958 --> 34:25.335
to allow the doors to be closed.

34:25.335 --> 34:27.514
- I'm pleased you're back.

34:27.514 --> 34:30.163
You are an asset to this hotel.

34:30.163 --> 34:33.614
These two young girls
are leaving this hotel.

34:33.614 --> 34:35.679
- This is exactly what
I've wanted all along.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.806
I've always wanted a true
general manager to run the place,

34:38.806 --> 34:40.184
and I would come here on the weekends,

34:40.184 --> 34:42.123
to help out with the decorations.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.146
- They know that it's not healthy.

34:44.146 --> 34:45.658
They know they can't continue.

34:45.658 --> 34:47.712
- Oh, I'm beyond ready to give Mandy,

34:47.712 --> 34:50.694
you know, full reins and full
control as general manager.

34:50.694 --> 34:52.436
I have full faith in her.

34:52.436 --> 34:56.231
She's a very powerful, very
competent, very strong lady.

34:56.231 --> 34:58.765
- Tomorrow, we are relaunching this hotel

34:58.765 --> 35:00.444
under new management

35:00.444 --> 35:02.216
and there are going to
be a lot of changes.

35:02.216 --> 35:05.574
I want all of you to get out
of here and get some rest,

35:05.574 --> 35:07.169
because tomorrow is one hell of a day.

35:07.169 --> 35:08.038
- Yeah.

35:08.038 --> 35:09.056
- Thank you.

35:09.056 --> 35:10.579
- Today, everyone wins,

35:10.579 --> 35:12.550
as the family is free to leave Pipestone,

35:12.550 --> 35:14.061
the staff get a proper leader,

35:14.061 --> 35:17.169
and Mandy gets the
freedom to be in charge.

35:17.169 --> 35:19.849
And overnight, the interior
of this historic building

35:19.849 --> 35:22.007
has got what it has long deserved too,

35:22.007 --> 35:24.207
a wonderful transformation.

35:24.207 --> 35:25.221
- Good morning.

35:25.221 --> 35:26.230
- Hi.

35:26.230 --> 35:29.713
- Welcome, to the new Calumet Inn.

35:29.713 --> 35:33.435
This is incredibly historic
and a very special hotel,

35:33.435 --> 35:34.304
but now it's somewhere,

35:34.304 --> 35:37.606
where guests are going to be
incredibly well looked after.

35:37.606 --> 35:39.361
Come with me, let's go.

35:44.155 --> 35:45.024
Come on, ladies.

35:45.024 --> 35:47.610
- Oh, my God!

35:47.610 --> 35:49.799
- Holy macaroni!

35:49.799 --> 35:54.352
(girls squealing in delight)

35:54.352 --> 35:55.759
- I take it, you like it?

35:55.759 --> 35:56.628
- I love it!
- Love it!

35:56.628 --> 35:58.252
- Gone is that disgusting wallpaper,

35:58.252 --> 36:01.536
now we have a stunning, bright,

36:01.536 --> 36:03.340
colourful paint of Kelly Green.

36:03.340 --> 36:07.281
A new mattress, new box frame,
new linen, and new cushions,

36:07.281 --> 36:12.109
and a bed to absolutely disappear in.

36:12.109 --> 36:13.485
Notice how bright it is?

36:13.485 --> 36:15.602
Let's try and keep the
bulbs in the fixtures, Jim,

36:15.602 --> 36:17.940
especially in that rear entrance tunnel.

36:17.940 --> 36:20.013
(everyone laughing)

36:20.013 --> 36:22.422
- Gone is that dreadful
rail in the corner,

36:22.422 --> 36:25.477
we replaced that with a
wonderful tall wardrobe,

36:25.477 --> 36:26.679
how nice is that?

36:26.679 --> 36:27.677
- Oh, yeah.

36:27.677 --> 36:30.617
- Beforehand, the jacuzzi looked awkward,

36:30.617 --> 36:32.098
now we framed the bathtub

36:32.098 --> 36:33.902
with these beautiful custom drapes.

36:33.902 --> 36:36.258
So you can highlight the fact
that it's a stunning jacuzzi,

36:36.258 --> 36:38.761
but we've given it his own space.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.982
- I'm blown away, I mean, you know,

36:40.982 --> 36:43.311
guests are actually going to be happy

36:43.311 --> 36:45.257
to spend their honeymoons here,

36:45.257 --> 36:48.479
and we're going to be proud
to actually show this room.

36:48.479 --> 36:51.544
- This one is really special, I mean,

36:51.544 --> 36:53.807
yeah, let's say a new edition.

36:53.807 --> 36:56.873
Please, welcome to my
favourite room, jump in there.

36:56.873 --> 36:57.834
Let's go.

36:57.834 --> 37:02.005
(everyone screaming in delight)

37:04.286 --> 37:05.162
Gone is the bedroom,

37:05.162 --> 37:08.824
you now have a fabulous,
unique fitness centre.

37:08.824 --> 37:10.480
(everyone clapping)

37:10.480 --> 37:12.701
Where guests, like myself,

37:12.701 --> 37:15.277
do not have to walk a hundred metres.

37:15.277 --> 37:17.987
- This room is actually what
everybody needs in here.

37:17.987 --> 37:19.187
When people are stressed out,

37:19.187 --> 37:20.208
when they want to kill each other,

37:20.208 --> 37:23.284
they could just go in
there, and just relax.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.370
- Can we take a seat, please?

37:25.370 --> 37:26.238
I've got something

37:26.238 --> 37:31.223
that is really going to
put this hotel on the map.

37:32.492 --> 37:33.360
The food before,

37:33.360 --> 37:34.879
lacked the heart you would
get from home cooking.

37:34.879 --> 37:38.133
It turns out, the answer
was right under our noses.

37:38.133 --> 37:42.992
Rita, we've adapted your cooking style,

37:42.992 --> 37:44.932
Rita's Thai specials.

37:44.932 --> 37:45.888
- Wow.
- Aw!

37:46.766 --> 37:50.447
- Rita, when I tasted your
food upstairs my darling,

37:50.447 --> 37:52.710
I was blown away.

37:52.710 --> 37:55.546
Now the legacy is going to continue,

37:55.546 --> 37:58.174
a stunning beef satay,

37:58.174 --> 38:00.895
and then a delicious green chicken curry,

38:00.895 --> 38:02.741
and a phenomenal pad Thai.

38:02.741 --> 38:04.787
Thank you ladies, come on, dig in.

38:04.787 --> 38:06.359
Dig in, dig in.

38:06.359 --> 38:07.965
- [Rina] This is real pad Thai.

38:07.965 --> 38:09.248
- Rita, what do you think, my darling?

38:09.248 --> 38:10.117
- Excellent.

38:10.117 --> 38:11.593
- Yeah?
- Yup.

38:11.593 --> 38:16.150
I am very excited to see
my Thai food on the menu.

38:16.150 --> 38:17.994
It tastes very good, yes.

38:17.994 --> 38:20.478
Thank you, thank you so much.

38:20.478 --> 38:23.606
(everyone clapping)

38:25.055 --> 38:26.307
- Okay, are we ready?

38:26.307 --> 38:27.175
- Guys, all good?

38:27.175 --> 38:28.687
- I'm ready.
- Ready to go?

38:28.687 --> 38:29.556
Yeah, brilliant.

38:29.556 --> 38:30.643
- [Narrator] With a rejuvenated energy,

38:30.643 --> 38:31.874
the staff are ready for the first night

38:31.874 --> 38:33.538
of the Calumet's new life.

38:33.538 --> 38:34.407
- I'm well.

38:34.407 --> 38:35.275
- Welcome to the Calumet Inn,

38:35.275 --> 38:37.014
my name's Mandy, general manager.

38:37.014 --> 38:37.883
- How are we doing tonight?

38:37.883 --> 38:39.169
- We're doing very well.

38:39.169 --> 38:40.837
- All right, we have a new menu.

38:43.093 --> 38:44.824
- First ticket, Jen, good luck.

38:44.824 --> 38:45.693
- Thank you.

38:45.693 --> 38:46.561
- [Gordon] You can do this.

38:46.561 --> 38:48.338
- Oh, this is a whole
new level of Thai food.

38:48.338 --> 38:50.445
It's fresh and I'm really
excited about that,

38:50.445 --> 38:51.956
it's something I've always wanted to do.

38:51.956 --> 38:54.240
- And for the first time,
parents Jim and Rita,

38:54.240 --> 38:55.804
are enjoying their investment,

38:55.804 --> 38:57.306
instead of having to work at it.

38:57.306 --> 38:58.414
- Much better, hey, Jim?

38:58.414 --> 38:59.829
- 1,000% better.

38:59.829 --> 39:00.697
Keep up a good work.

39:00.697 --> 39:03.235
- Yeah, I will. (laughing)

39:03.235 --> 39:04.542
- [Gordon] When Mandy agreed to return,

39:04.542 --> 39:06.471
it was on the condition
that Rina and Vanda

39:06.471 --> 39:07.691
would be out of the picture.

39:07.691 --> 39:10.652
Unfortunately, these sisters
can't stop interfering.

39:10.652 --> 39:12.279
- Are we good?

39:12.279 --> 39:13.374
Excellent.

39:13.374 --> 39:14.604
- And were you still working on that,

39:14.604 --> 39:15.699
or would you like me to take?

39:15.699 --> 39:17.482
Okay, all right, enjoy.

39:17.482 --> 39:19.474
- Ooh, how are you doing tonight?

39:19.474 --> 39:20.360
Do you have a wine list?

39:20.360 --> 39:21.635
I can go grab you one.

39:23.133 --> 39:24.458
Oh, my gosh, I had...

39:24.458 --> 39:27.440
They remade our wine list, I had no idea.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.494
- The hotel can't afford
to lose Mandy again.

39:29.494 --> 39:31.767
With so much at stake,
I've got to step in.

39:31.767 --> 39:33.978
What are you doing?

39:33.978 --> 39:36.848
- I am meeting and greeting the guests.

39:36.848 --> 39:37.815
- What are you doing?

39:37.815 --> 39:39.097
- Hi, I'm helping out.

39:39.097 --> 39:40.182
- Helping out?

39:40.182 --> 39:41.214
Let me just tell you something.

39:41.214 --> 39:42.225
You swanning around,

39:42.225 --> 39:44.363
looking like you're
here to take the cream,

39:44.363 --> 39:46.104
because you want to
meet-and-greet the guests.

39:46.104 --> 39:48.802
You've actually done fuck all tonight.

39:48.802 --> 39:50.317
- What am I supposed to do?

39:50.317 --> 39:52.395
- Get back upstairs and pack, now!

39:54.101 --> 39:58.257
(electrical interference)

39:58.257 --> 40:00.105
- [Gordon] The Calumet's
relaunch is going well.

40:00.105 --> 40:01.912
And the team are handling more guests

40:01.912 --> 40:03.518
than the hotel has seen in years.

40:03.518 --> 40:05.645
- Two rib eyes and a spare rib, I got it.

40:05.645 --> 40:08.304
- [Gordon] The guests are
loving the new rooms upstairs.

40:08.304 --> 40:09.325
- Definitely like the colour,

40:09.325 --> 40:11.724
the green really makes it bright.

40:11.724 --> 40:14.268
- It's a nice mix of old and new.

40:14.268 --> 40:15.137
- Yeah.

40:15.137 --> 40:16.332
- Hey, yeah, I would come back here.

40:16.332 --> 40:17.201
- [Gordon] And I'm really pleased

40:17.201 --> 40:19.982
to see Mandy stepping up and
taking control of the team,

40:19.982 --> 40:20.851
as the general manager.

40:20.851 --> 40:22.443
- You have to communicate with the kitchen

40:22.443 --> 40:23.642
a little bit better.

40:23.642 --> 40:25.873
- [Gordon] There's just
one last detail to address,

40:25.873 --> 40:28.097
Rina and Vanda need to hit the road.

40:29.950 --> 40:30.819
- Hello?

40:30.819 --> 40:33.308
- Vanda, are you finished packing yet?

40:33.308 --> 40:34.768
The taxi is on its way.

40:34.768 --> 40:35.636
- I'm going!

40:37.437 --> 40:40.044
- Okay, ladies, taxi is here.

40:40.044 --> 40:43.094
Hey, listen, safe travels
and good luck, okay?

40:43.094 --> 40:43.962
- Thank you.

40:43.962 --> 40:44.831
- A little present for you,

40:44.831 --> 40:47.751
to teach you responsibility
back in Minneapolis.

40:47.751 --> 40:49.762
(girls squealing)

40:49.762 --> 40:50.630
Please.

40:50.630 --> 40:52.546
- Oh, dear Lord.
- Oh, thank you.

40:52.546 --> 40:54.256
- Now, look after them.

40:54.256 --> 40:56.164
Once you've got the hang
of looking after those,

40:56.164 --> 40:57.269
then we can step up to a cat.

40:57.269 --> 40:58.138
- Okay.

40:58.138 --> 40:59.956
- Once the cat's fine,
then we go up to a dog.

40:59.956 --> 41:00.825
- It'll be fine.

41:00.825 --> 41:02.754
- Look after those fish, good night.

41:02.754 --> 41:05.235
- I'm going to go off
and pursue my dreams.

41:05.235 --> 41:10.448
I'm going to travel and
continue onwards into my 30s

41:11.565 --> 41:14.488
a happy person, not miserable.

41:15.746 --> 41:17.362
- The goldfish!

41:17.362 --> 41:19.288
Don't drop it.

41:19.288 --> 41:21.766
- I will not drop the gold fish.

41:23.410 --> 41:25.746
- I'm going back to Minneapolis
but I'm really excited

41:25.746 --> 41:28.144
to feel free to let out my creativity

41:28.144 --> 41:30.667
and show the world what I'm capable of.

41:30.667 --> 41:32.377
Look, one is bigger, and one is smaller,

41:32.377 --> 41:35.297
the bigger one can be Rina,
the little one can be Vanda.

41:36.944 --> 41:37.813
- What a week!

41:37.813 --> 41:40.557
When I first arrived, they
were two spoiled brats,

41:40.557 --> 41:43.837
that were playing at running a hotel.

41:43.837 --> 41:45.609
The change has been extraordinary.

41:45.609 --> 41:49.791
The key to the turnaround
was in Mandy coming back,

41:49.791 --> 41:54.121
and standing strong as a
proper general manager.

41:57.381 --> 41:59.707
This time it's a proper goodbye,

41:59.707 --> 42:03.349
and I cannot wait to
come back and see you.

42:03.349 --> 42:05.379
- Awesome.
- I believe in you.

42:05.379 --> 42:08.486
You already have made a big
difference, good luck with it.

42:08.486 --> 42:09.887
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

42:09.887 --> 42:11.513
- Well done.
- Thank you so much.

42:11.513 --> 42:12.650
- Good night, darling.

42:12.650 --> 42:14.294
- I feel like a whole new person.

42:14.294 --> 42:16.745
I am ready to just go full bore with this.

42:16.745 --> 42:18.736
Thank you so much, Gordon,

42:18.736 --> 42:21.440
for giving me my job back,
and for believing in me.

42:23.856 --> 42:26.170
- I do hope those goldfish survive,

42:26.170 --> 42:31.383
it's 50/50. (chuckling)

42:59.506 --> 43:00.538
- [Female] One potato, two potato.

43:00.538 --> 43:02.992
- [Rina] I thought Gordon
was going to be nice to me.
