WEBVTT

00:07.633 --> 00:09.134
Kane is in the building, nigga...

00:23.149 --> 00:25.982
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top

00:26.277 --> 00:29.986
When only heaven ’3 right above it, we on

00:30.448 --> 00:32.905
’Cause we on

00:32.992 --> 00:35.574
Who else is really trying to fuck
with Hollywood Cole?

00:35.661 --> 00:37.197
I’m with Marley G, bro

00:37.288 --> 00:40.371
Flying Holly Grove chicks
to my Hollywood shows

00:40.458 --> 00:43.416
And / wanna tell you
something that you probably should know

00:43.502 --> 00:46.710
This that
Slumdog Millionaire Bol/ywood flow

00:46.797 --> 00:48.128
And...

00:48.216 --> 00:50.298
My real friends never hearing from me

00:50.384 --> 00:53.467
Fake friends write the wrong
answers on the mirror for me

00:53.554 --> 00:56.546
That’s why / pick and choose
/ don ’t get shit confused

00:56.641 --> 01:00.133
Don ’t like my women sing/e
/ like my chicks in twos

01:00.228 --> 01:02.935
And these days
all the girls is down to roll

01:03.022 --> 01:05.559
/ hit the strip club
and all them bitches ﬁnd the pole

01:06.150 --> 01:09.267
Plus, lbeen sippin’
So this shit is movin’ kinda slow

01:09.362 --> 01:12.570
Just tell my girl
to tell her friend that it’s time to go

01:17.870 --> 01:20.077
-Hey.
-Hey, good morning, Bret.

01:20.331 --> 01:22.572
-Comrades!
-Mr. Anderson.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.453
-You know what? Call me Bret.
-Serious|y?

01:24.543 --> 01:25.999
Yeah, I mean, what the fuck?

01:26.087 --> 01:27.668
I think we're there.
Come here.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.041
-Oh.
-Mwah. I love this guy.

01:30.132 --> 01:32.748
-Wow.
-I feel the same way, Bret.

01:33.094 --> 01:36.507
Hey, now that Hastings came through
with the land and the $100 million,

01:36.597 --> 01:38.007
I really think
it's our turn to step it up.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.010
-We gotta do this.
-All we gotta do is get half

01:40.101 --> 01:41.966
of what this monstrosity is gonna cost

01:42.061 --> 01:44.848
and the bank will cover the rest, Bret.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.347
Well, my rich foreign friends

01:48.442 --> 01:51.184
are opening their Checkbooks
as we speak,

01:51.279 --> 01:53.986
so pack your bags, gentlemen.

01:54.198 --> 01:56.063
We are going on a little road trip.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.568
-Heyl
-Where we headed, Bret?

01:57.660 --> 01:59.150
First up, Saudi Arabia,

01:59.245 --> 02:03.705
then China, then Germany,
and then the UK.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.123
These guys are so enamored
with American sports,

02:06.502 --> 02:08.788
they can't wait to claim
their little piece.

02:08.879 --> 02:10.255
How about we just call them?

02:12.341 --> 02:14.457
We're not texting Mommy and Daddy

02:14.552 --> 02:16.964
for beer money
like goddamn college students.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.545
If we don't have the money
by next week's owners' meeting,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.631
then Bossman can't swing
the votes our way.

02:21.726 --> 02:23.967
Plus, we can't leave
ASM abandoned that long.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.181
I'm thinking with its significant stake

02:26.272 --> 02:27.808
in the global real estate market

02:27.898 --> 02:30.981
that Anderson Financial
would find a proposal like this

02:31.068 --> 02:32.683
-extremely intriguing.
-Whoa, whoa.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.439
We are not going to fucking New York.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.771
Come on, they already know
what we're capable

02:36.866 --> 02:38.402
-of accomplishing, Bret.
-No, no, no.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.859
Yes, and betting on the mother ship
is far greater than going global.

02:41.954 --> 02:42.989
Don't do that.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.820
No, don't do that.
It's four hours away.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.201
No go! You guys might not know this,

02:47.293 --> 02:48.954
but I'm not exactly
on the greatest terms

02:49.045 --> 02:50.706
with the board at the current moment.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.287
-Your name is on the building.
-Doesn't mean diddly dick.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.256
I'm basicallyjust an employee
like you two humps.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.676
You're an employee with a gigantic yacht

02:58.763 --> 03:00.549
and an amazing mansion in Palm Beach.

03:00.639 --> 03:01.970
-Come on.
-Yeah, you can do this.

03:02.058 --> 03:04.424
-You're the man, Bret.
-lt's the best play we got.

03:04.643 --> 03:05.678
I believe in you.

03:06.062 --> 03:09.554
We. We believe in you, Bret.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.934
Stop calling me Bret.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.561
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

03:14.612 --> 03:16.102
-That the quad?
-Yeah.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.687
No dairy, just like you asked.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.648
Got one for myself.
The stuff makes my nerves all jangly.

03:20.743 --> 03:21.983
Maybe it's something else.

03:22.578 --> 03:23.658
Can we not beat around the bush

03:23.746 --> 03:25.111
and just talk about what happened
the other night?

03:25.456 --> 03:26.662
Your wife's a great cook.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.622
Thank her for the to-go plate.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.419
Look, we all thrive on competition
in this business.

03:34.924 --> 03:37.210
And the urge to win is exactly
how we all got to where we are.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.292
But if you and Coach Berg
can't get on the same page,

03:39.387 --> 03:41.378
well, all we got is
a house built on sand.

03:41.472 --> 03:42.507
"The same page?"

03:42.598 --> 03:43.804
We're not even in the same book

03:43.891 --> 03:45.722
or the same fucking library,
for that matter.

03:45.810 --> 03:49.098
Okay, so then let's write
a new book together.

03:49.188 --> 03:51.349
Good idea.
I got the perfect title,

03:51.732 --> 03:53.268
"Finding a New Head Coach."

03:53.442 --> 03:55.023
(MUMBLES)

03:58.406 --> 03:59.521
(PAPER FLIPPING)

03:59.657 --> 04:00.692
You're gonna let Berg go?

04:00.783 --> 04:03.195
No, I think since you two
have gotten so close,

04:03.536 --> 04:04.696
you're the man to do it.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.198
No, you ain't gonna pull
that shit on me again.

04:07.832 --> 04:10.244
This is the head coach,
not some offensive lineman.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.165
Better the news comes from a friend.

04:12.253 --> 04:15.211
Maybe you and Julie can
whip him up a Last Supper.

04:15.381 --> 04:17.167
Be sure and bring me some leftovers.

04:18.217 --> 04:19.252
Amen.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.260
(MUSIC PLAYING)

04:31.021 --> 04:32.761
Damn, T, you got enough food?

04:32.857 --> 04:34.643
Fuck you, Jason. I'm eating for two.

04:34.859 --> 04:35.894
Well, me and this nigga.

04:35.985 --> 04:37.020
What's the deal with my new contract?

04:37.111 --> 04:39.898
Well, the Pats, they're digging in
on a one-year deal.

04:39.989 --> 04:42.355
-Cheap motherfuckers.
-Hey, it'sjust a starting point.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.485
You know I'm gonna get them to two.

04:43.576 --> 04:45.908
I never missed an assignment
or was late for a meeting,

04:45.995 --> 04:47.781
and I caught 104 passes last year.

04:47.872 --> 04:50.909
On 138 targets.
Rick's the good-hands man.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.877
It's not personal.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.917
Well, I just want my money.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.541
l practically played for free
the last two seasons, J.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.247
You asked for a ring, you got one.

05:00.342 --> 05:03.004
You want some more money,
we're gonna grind it outwith Belichick.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.586
Let me get on it,
you enjoy your quinoa, okay?

05:05.681 --> 05:07.046
I'll call you later.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.259
Please do.

05:11.729 --> 05:13.014
What's wrong with you, man?

05:13.105 --> 05:14.970
You're gonna put somebody eye out
with a grapefruit.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.726
Get outta here.
Somebody should kick him out.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.353
-What are you doing?
-That wasn't me! It was that guy!

05:18.444 --> 05:19.684
What are you doing?

05:23.616 --> 05:24.651
Hannah!

05:25.493 --> 05:26.858
Hannah, my love,

05:26.952 --> 05:29.238
can I get another drink,
and make it a real double this time?

05:29.330 --> 05:30.695
-Yes, of course.
-Thank you.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.909
We land in, like, 10 minutes.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.956
Yeah, like that's
ever stopped me before.

05:35.044 --> 05:37.080
Oh, the pilot says we're being rerouted.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.162
Wait, wait, what?
Hold on, what?

05:39.256 --> 05:40.837
What's that? What?

05:42.051 --> 05:43.882
Can you make it a triple
if we're crashing?

05:43.969 --> 05:45.925
Anderson Financial moved
your meeting to the Hamptons.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.049
Yeah, whoa, whoa. Why, why, why?

05:48.140 --> 05:50.256
The CEO didn't return
to the city as planned,

05:50.351 --> 05:51.591
so we land in 20 minutes.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.221
-Cool.
-|'|| get you that drink.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.098
Probably having a death cult meeting.

05:55.189 --> 05:58.056
It's okay.
It's just a change in location.

05:58.150 --> 06:01.938
Now we gotta listen to that prick brag
about his fancy fucking beach house.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.020
It's gonna work out
in our favor, all right?

06:04.114 --> 06:05.570
Casual setting, it's good for business.

06:05.658 --> 06:07.740
That's right, we do our best work
outside of the office.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.657
I closed Josh Norman at The Body Shop.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.656
Yes, and then the Hamptons
is where Roc Nation

06:11.747 --> 06:13.863
closed that huge Kevin Durant deal
for the Warriors.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.164
That's right, good karma.

06:15.251 --> 06:16.491
What are you, a fucking Buddhist now?

06:16.585 --> 06:18.871
Bret, do you wanna go over the P&Ls
one more time before we land?

06:18.963 --> 06:20.203
I know what the damn...

06:20.297 --> 06:22.128
I know the pitch, okay?

06:22.550 --> 06:24.836
I'd just rather do it
at a One Direction concert.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.548
I wish you'd stay sitting
in one direction.

06:28.806 --> 06:29.886
I'm trying.

06:31.267 --> 06:34.555
And now because of your brisket,
I gotta go fire Berg.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.681
I didn't know it was gonna turn
into a steel cage match.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.229
You had everybody at the table
holding hands, saying grace.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.056
Coach Berg only prays for victory.

06:41.527 --> 06:43.563
/ was trying to bring God to the table.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.065
Yeah, to break bread
with the Antichrist.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.817
You don't want my help,
then stop asking.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.444
Why you calling me at work anyway?

06:49.994 --> 06:51.484
| just thought you should know.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.864
You want somebody
to blame for your mess,

06:52.955 --> 06:54.741
go find a big-ass mirror.

06:54.832 --> 06:55.867
You...

07:00.546 --> 07:01.661
RICKY: Julie Greane.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.870
Hey!

07:03.674 --> 07:04.754
You're early, Ricky.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.298
lam, lam indeed.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.584
Eager to hear all is well
upstairs, you know.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.966
-Hey, You remember TTD.
-Unfortunately, I do.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.092
TTD: Ms. Dr. Greane.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.890
Hey. Just go in there.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.558
-After you.
-All right.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.765
Doc, I'm concerned.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.439
He's had dizziness, headaches,

07:22.526 --> 07:25.063
light sensitivity,
some serious-ass memory problems.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.644
I remember telling you
to stay the fuck home.

07:26.739 --> 07:28.570
And he's been irritable as fuck, too.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.318
You need to see a neurologist.

07:30.409 --> 07:33.025
Now, it would be unethical for me
to examine your head.

07:33.579 --> 07:36.571
But I do have a friend that works
in the south wing that can talk to you.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.496
She specializes in brain injuries.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.786
All right, I trust you.

07:41.545 --> 07:44.412
And if you trust her, let's go with it.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.543
All right, here's her card.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.958
Nobody can know about this,
not even Chuck, okay?

07:49.053 --> 07:51.590
I won't say a word,
and Dr. Robbins is very discreet.

07:53.599 --> 07:54.634
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

07:54.725 --> 07:55.840
Now, I'll tell her you're coming.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.515
-All right, bring it in, Doc.
-No.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.640
Damn, I'm seeing Charles
in a whole new light.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.021
(WHAT TIME IS IT BY LOU PHELPS PLAYING)

08:21.251 --> 08:23.458
If we get bogged down
in private equity bullshit,

08:23.545 --> 08:25.376
I'm just gonna break out
some locker room stories.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.670
Maybe spare them the one about

08:26.757 --> 08:28.213
how you took a shit
in Chad Pennington's cleats.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.006
-What do you say?
-He deserved it.

08:30.803 --> 08:31.883
You okay, boss?

08:32.096 --> 08:34.337
Yeah, fine. Yeah, I'm fine.

08:35.891 --> 08:37.301
Shit, man, I'd live here.

08:37.393 --> 08:40.100
It's a nice one, but you know what,
who gives a shit how nice it is?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.848
We're gonna go in there and kill it.
Come on.

08:41.939 --> 08:44.430
Hey, guys, there's something
I haven't quite told you...

08:44.525 --> 08:48.268
-There's my big bro.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, there he is.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.318
How'd you like the newjet?

08:50.572 --> 08:54.190
Well, the gold-plated seat belt buckles,
very nice touch.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.070
My colleagues, Joe, Spencer.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.367
My brother Julian.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.320
Wow. Hey, we've heard so much about you.

08:59.415 --> 09:00.780
Yeah, he goes on and on and on.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.990
I bet he does, I bet he does.
Come on, let's go inside.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.417
-On and on.
-Yeah, come grab a drink.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.296
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

09:10.801 --> 09:15.295
Anderson Financial's core business
has always been real estate development.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.220
This project goes far beyond

09:17.307 --> 09:21.266
any state-of—the-art retractable-roof
stadium ever constructed.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.720
970,000 square feet of retail space...

09:24.815 --> 09:25.930
All right, so let me get this straight.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.889
So, our dalliance into sports with ASM

09:27.985 --> 09:30.567
has somehow turned into
building an NFL stadium?

09:33.657 --> 09:36.774
That dalliance has proved
well worth the company's while.

09:36.869 --> 09:39.406
It's astounding that you're
even involved in sports.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.284
This guy was always the last one
to be picked when we were kids.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.782
You were a superstar, though,
when it came to eating paste.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.791
Maybe that's why you started balding
in the ninth grade, huh?

09:46.879 --> 09:49.291
That's funny.
What the fuck are you laughing at?

09:49.381 --> 09:50.621
-I wasn't.
-If you're gonna pitch me

09:50.716 --> 09:51.831
a sports complex,

09:52.968 --> 09:54.549
I wanna hear from the sports guy.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.676
How about it, Spencer?

09:58.307 --> 10:01.014
Well, it's really not my place.
Mr. Anderson's the boss.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.762
No, I'm the boss, applesauce.

10:03.937 --> 10:04.972
Not him.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.767
-Hmm.
-All right, very good.

10:12.196 --> 10:13.527
Lay it on me, come on.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.070
Explain to me why we should risk

10:15.157 --> 10:18.024
a portion of the family fortune
to pay for this thing.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.786
(I DON'T KNOW BY SLUM VILLAGE PLAYING)

10:25.417 --> 10:26.452
All right.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.287
I'd love to.

10:28.504 --> 10:29.539
Me, too.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.333
Go, go!

10:34.384 --> 10:35.419
Back up!

10:36.595 --> 10:38.051
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

10:38.138 --> 10:39.253
(GRUNTING)

10:41.016 --> 10:42.347
I'm watching you, Holland.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.892
-Mine, mine!
-Look, why is he...

10:46.522 --> 10:47.511
Mine!

10:48.232 --> 10:51.440
COACH BERG: Ninety-six percent
of the time, your head is in your ass!

10:51.527 --> 10:54.985
Sprint to the spot, get set,
and look the ball in.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.688
What the fuck is wrong with your brain?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.908
-Hey, Coach.
-Charles.

11:02.788 --> 11:03.823
You got a sec?

11:05.249 --> 11:07.035
Oh, no, don't tell me old Ziegfart's

11:07.125 --> 11:08.501
still getting on you
for the other night.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.837
Yeah, I'm still catching
my fair share for that,

11:10.921 --> 11:12.331
but that's not why I'm here.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.381
He sent me down here to let you go.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.679
-You're firing me, Charles?
-No, Siefert's firing you.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.879
-l'm just telling you.
-That chickenshit.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.555
Yeah, it's all kinds of wrong.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.678
Oh, is it all kinds of wrong, Charles?

11:25.769 --> 11:27.760
-You ain't the one getting fired.
-No, but, I mean...

11:27.855 --> 11:31.188
But you ain't the one getting fired.
I'm getting fired. I should've cut him.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.561
The other night when I had him
on your dining room table,

11:33.652 --> 11:35.483
I had my eyes on
your wife's brisket knife.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.108
I swear to God, I saw it...
I saw it in my mind, Charles.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.984
I could see it,
l was gonna pick up the knife,

11:40.075 --> 11:42.316
l was gonna stick it
right in his fucking face.

11:42.995 --> 11:44.405
I couldn't quite get to it, though.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.158
-You had me, so I popped him instead.
-Yeah.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.163
It's probably better
that you didn't stab him.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.454
Fuck it. Fuck it. It's all good.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.419
It's all good, Charles.
I'll have anotherjob in a week.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.167
This son of a bitch, when they fire him,

11:56.258 --> 11:58.465
ain't no team in the NFL
is gonna touch him.

11:58.635 --> 11:59.920
And I'll tell you something else,

12:00.012 --> 12:01.718
all these players that
are killing it out here,

12:01.805 --> 12:03.670
Sutton, all of them
those are your picks.

12:03.765 --> 12:04.845
-Everybody knows it.
-Thanks.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.764
-That's nice of you to say.
-Fuck nice, Charles.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.388
I don't do nice. I hate nice.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.309
-Fuck nice. Say it.
-Fuck nice.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.728
You're so fucking nice, Charles.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.351
And you were right about Kisan,

12:13.442 --> 12:15.353
and he was a moron
for not signing him.

12:15.444 --> 12:18.936
Yeah! Hey.
Good luck, Berg.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.942
-Fuck you, Charles.
-Okay.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.111
-I got it!
-No!

12:23.660 --> 12:24.695
No!

12:24.828 --> 12:27.490
Watch the ball.
What about him?

12:27.581 --> 12:29.537
He didn't say anything about Csonka.

12:29.625 --> 12:30.740
Didn't say anything about Csonka, huh?

12:30.834 --> 12:32.119
Fuck you!

12:33.378 --> 12:35.915
The ball doesn't care about you!

12:36.340 --> 12:37.375
What's going on?

12:37.841 --> 12:39.581
Siefert sent me down here to let him go.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.133
-Aw, man!
-Your heads are in your ass!

12:42.220 --> 12:44.176
They're in there! Get 'em out!

12:45.766 --> 12:47.006
(CRASHES)

12:50.312 --> 12:52.143
-God!
-I think he made the right call.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.349
See you, Coach!

12:53.440 --> 12:55.556
The last time
I was in New York for business,

12:55.651 --> 12:57.141
l sacked Eli three times.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.645
Knocked his dick in the dirt.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.978
You know, the transition's
been kind of abrupt,

13:02.074 --> 13:03.564
going from lining up on Sundays

13:03.659 --> 13:06.822
to high-level finance
with these aces over here.

13:06.912 --> 13:09.369
Yeah, no, I know who you are, Spencer.
I pay your salary.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.868
So save the anecdotes for
your Hall of Fame speech, you know?

13:12.084 --> 13:13.494
-(CHUCKL|NG) Okay.
-All right.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.121
Well, we've got $100 million

13:15.212 --> 13:17.248
and a promise to deliver land
from Wayne Hastings.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.079
-Oh, the casino guy?
-Yeah, the casino guy.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.914
Yeah, Wayne understands that the NFL

13:21.009 --> 13:23.125
is the most profitable
sports league on earth,

13:23.220 --> 13:25.836
and there are only so many opportunities
that come along like this.

13:25.931 --> 13:29.549
I mean, you're talking about an enormous
real estate play with an A-list tenant.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.349
The Raiders had a great season.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.222
It's a shame Derek Carr
went down when he did.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.689
Yeah, he was a great QB.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.855
Let me tell you about this stadium
we're talking about.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.604
It's just not gonna be Raiders games
and Super Bowls.

13:39.695 --> 13:42.562
Think about it,
so, year-round we got college football,

13:42.656 --> 13:45.238
we'll have UFC, Final Four,

13:45.325 --> 13:47.486
soccer, concerts,
we're gonna have everything.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.862
It's a big swing.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.278
Plan to divest yourself of your clients?

13:51.456 --> 13:53.117
(LAUGHING) Never, no.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.282
That's the ground
we built the company on.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.663
You can't possibly hope to handle
the day-to-day at ASM

13:57.754 --> 13:59.540
while managing a billion-dollar
real estate venture.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.543
I've been handling the clients while
Spencer runs point on this project.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.215
Yeah, moving along pretty smoothly.

14:04.302 --> 14:05.462
Joe's been crushing it.

14:05.762 --> 14:10.756
| read that one of your highest earners
was suspended for pot.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.684
Yeah, Vernon Littelfield.
The kid made an honest mistake.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.306
Still, got him four games.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.808
Read it on Twitter
before you guys got here.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.935
Well, it's no wonder
you guys are thinking bigger.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.484
I mean, the client side
must be getting tedious.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.108
Oh, my God, what the fuck?

14:25.574 --> 14:27.485
Jesus Christ, what is this,

14:27.659 --> 14:30.992
a business presentation
or a goddamn inquisition?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.910
You know what?
Can somebody please bring Bret

14:32.998 --> 14:35.205
a tub of paste to help him
calm his nerves?

14:35.292 --> 14:37.283
You see that? That's why I didn't
wanna come to New York.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.618
Make it big. Whip it up.
He likes to make a mustache.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.170
Put a crown on your head,
call yourself king of the idiots.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.838
-Tend to your guns.
-Fucking piece of shit.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.257
You know what you are?
It's so bad, I can't even say it.

14:46.344 --> 14:47.925
Bret, come on.
God damn it, Julian!

14:48.013 --> 14:49.298
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.380
You're the fucking CEO
of a major company

14:51.475 --> 14:52.806
and you're letting this sibling bullshit

14:52.893 --> 14:55.509
get in the way
of a massively lucrative deal?

14:55.604 --> 14:57.970
You got me up here
fucking trying to tap dance for you.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.056
Now we're finally getting to the root

15:00.150 --> 15:02.311
of what you actually do
for this company, see?

15:02.402 --> 15:03.983
-You're a dancer.
-Oh, don't do that.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.902
Yeah, you're funny.
Let me tell you something, motherfucker,

15:05.989 --> 15:07.024
I ain't no dancer.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.897
But I'm the guy
who takes care of his guys,

15:08.992 --> 15:10.983
which is a lot more
than I can say for you.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.160
So go fuck yourself, fuck-face.
Fuck you.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.326
Oh, the double.

15:14.748 --> 15:15.954
His fingers smell.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.157
Well, bravo. Bravo, Spencer!

Feel free to knock over
something expensive on your way out.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

15:22.255 --> 15:23.916
-l was kidding!
-BRET: That was me!

15:24.007 --> 15:26.965
It was a picture of you
and Dad, you fuck-face.

15:27.052 --> 15:27.086
Type the numbers
in the order they appear.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.005
Type the numbers
in the order they appear.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.506
-Let's go, I'm ready.
-All right.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.758
One more and we'll move on.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.847
-One more.
-You got this. You got it.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.520
Seven, four,

15:45.070 --> 15:47.607
three, four,

15:47.906 --> 15:50.238
nine, six, one.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.617
Man, I can't do that shit,
and I ain't never even played football.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.956
| see what you're saying.
I'm gonna be quiet, Doc. I'm sorry.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.248
Let's test your verbal fluency.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.327
Okay? This is oral word association.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.162
I'd like you to say
as many words as you can

16:06.258 --> 16:07.964
that begin with the letter C.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.461
They can't be proper nouns

16:09.553 --> 16:11.919
and they can't be names
of people or places.

16:12.597 --> 16:13.632
Go.

16:14.766 --> 16:15.881
Car.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.179
Carry.

16:25.569 --> 16:28.402
Try not to reuse a word
with a different ending.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.771
-You got it, you got it.
-Church.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.779
-Chapel.
-Those ain't the same either.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.326
-Hmm.
-Good job.

16:36.580 --> 16:37.740
She ain't say, "no curse words".

16:37.831 --> 16:39.162
It's right there for the taking.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.663
-Cunt.
-Okay.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.286
That'II do.

16:42.627 --> 16:43.662
Good job.

16:44.421 --> 16:47.504
Based on the neurocognitive
and physical exams...

16:49.009 --> 16:52.376
I can see that you're suffering
from post-concussion syndrome, Ricky.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.672
What?

16:54.055 --> 16:56.262
Though, I haven't figured out
what your friend's problem is.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.759
| just smoke a lot of dope.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.179
Your brain needs to rest and heal.

17:00.437 --> 17:03.179
You should avoid football,
stay away from all strenuous activities

17:03.273 --> 17:05.434
and stressful situations
for at least a month.

17:05.734 --> 17:06.769
Four weeks?

17:06.902 --> 17:08.767
And it might be longer.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.144
I mean, there's no real way to tell.

17:11.948 --> 17:15.361
Eating brain-healthy foods
can help the healing process.

17:15.452 --> 17:18.194
Things like blueberries and avocados.

17:18.288 --> 17:21.246
Wait, you're saying my brain is jacked
and the answer is guacamole?

17:21.333 --> 17:24.200
I'm just recommending
possible ways to speed your recovery.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.212
We got it, Doc.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.411
I'll make sure he's rested.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.837
I'll be good by the beginning
of this season, though, right?

17:29.925 --> 17:31.165
Don't assume that.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.087
It could take some more time.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.219
BRET: What do you mean
the plane is grounded?

17:39.309 --> 17:40.549
We gotta go back to Miami.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.225
We can't fly
without a fuel control unit.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.552
You know anything about FCUs?

17:43.647 --> 17:46.389
I know I gotta FCU the fuck outta here.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.565
I'm afraid I can't help you right now.
I'm sorry.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.734
There's nothing wrong with the plane.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.603
I know that.

17:53.323 --> 17:54.563
It's fuck-face.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.068
My brother, he's fucking us.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.575
Yeah, 'cause he's
a fucking asshole, that's why.

17:58.662 --> 18:01.825
I gotta tell you, I'm still surprised
you didn't tell us he was the CEO.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.997
Defense mechanism,
my subconscious speaking.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.494
Because of all
the emotional abuse you took.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.372
No, because he's a dick.
Let's say it together one time,

18:10.257 --> 18:14.296
-fucking hate New York!
-fucking hate New York.

18:14.386 --> 18:15.842
I fucking hate New York!

18:15.929 --> 18:17.009
I don't hate New York.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.634
Well, you're gonna love
this message from Virginia.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.430
She can't get us out
till tomorrow morning.

18:21.518 --> 18:22.553
Oh, sweet.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.393
Let's go to my favorite joint.
Happy hour.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.515
Okay!

18:36.950 --> 18:38.656
Look at her ass right there, bro.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.153
SIEFERT:
I'll set up the press conference.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.486
All right, can I change
my number to 26? Today's date.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.241
That's how much it means
to me to be a Dolphin.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.367
Actually, it's the 25th.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.449
Oh, shit, 25. Even better, right?

18:47.544 --> 18:48.659
l'll hit up the equipment manager.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.414
Appreciate it.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.871
Hey, great to have you onboard.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.081
Be an exciting season.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.836
Indeed, man. Thank y'all.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.629
(WHOOPING)

18:57.846 --> 19:01.009
Man, whosoever calling the plays
is gonna have a fucking field day.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.305
You look good, Chuck.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.097
KlSAN: Yeah, baby!

19:07.564 --> 19:10.431
When'd you change your mind?
I thought you had concerns.

19:10.525 --> 19:13.016
He brings his boys, he brings his boys.

19:13.528 --> 19:14.563
Wh...

19:14.779 --> 19:18.613
Well, in that case,
he won't let us down.

19:19.034 --> 19:22.117
He won't let me down
'cause he's your responsibility now.

19:22.203 --> 19:25.570
He rushes for 1,000 yards,
stays out of trouble, I'm a genius.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.496
He gets pulled over
with a gun under his seat,

19:27.584 --> 19:29.290
you fucked up for raising the idea.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.914
Win-win for me, lose-lose for you.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.289
You made a great decision signing him.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.462
We'll see.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.130
We'll see.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.347
I'm taking the Pats' offer.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.846
JASON: Well, they haven ’t responded
to our counter yet.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.312
Take the first damn offer!

19:48.396 --> 19:49.772
Money isn’t everything, J.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.221
Look, I can get more out of him.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.806
It’s just gonna take
a little bit more time.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.311
-No drops! What?
-You threw it--

19:54.402 --> 19:56.893
How much time do any of us
really have, though, J?

19:56.988 --> 19:58.273
You actually want me to answer that?

19:58.365 --> 20:00.947
What I want you to do
is lock down that deal, all right?

20:01.034 --> 20:02.444
You know, it's a pretty big turn.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.945
Once we accept, there's no going back.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.993
Don't want to.
Close that shit in the morning.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.446
All right, consider it done.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.408
Bring it. There it is!

20:11.503 --> 20:13.118
-Don't throw those.
-All right.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.248
Looking like me.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.751
Vern, Vern, Vern, Vern,
listen to me, please.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.416
You should be thanking
the good Lord in heaven

20:19.511 --> 20:21.422
-that you only got four games.
-Shit.

20:21.805 --> 20:22.920
Don't worry about that.

20:23.014 --> 20:26.131
You're gonna make up for your salary hit
with your asset allocation,

20:26.226 --> 20:29.593
which is outperforming competing stock
and bond indices, by the way,

20:29.687 --> 20:32.178
and mutual funds and hedge funds,
you're welcome.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.685
The VR company is standing beside you.

20:34.776 --> 20:35.811
We're all good.

20:36.444 --> 20:37.775
Let me talk to him.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.318
Yeah, we'll talk when we get home, okay?

20:39.406 --> 20:41.647
Listen, hang on,
Spencer wants to talk to you.

20:43.368 --> 20:44.733
-He hung up.
-You fucking hung up.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.238
l. He hung up first!

20:46.329 --> 20:48.536
Wow, Joe is turning into Spencer 2.0.

20:48.623 --> 20:51.035
-Yeah, a lot smaller.
-A lot sexier.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.367
Your driver told me
I'd find you guys here.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.792
You know, Bret and l

20:54.879 --> 20:56.835
used to sneak in here
when we were teenagers

20:56.923 --> 20:57.958
back when we used to like each other.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.334
You know what? Take your own note...

20:59.426 --> 21:00.461
Yes?

21:00.885 --> 21:02.170
...and skip the nostalgia.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.344
Come on, come on.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.046
I didn't ground the jet to be a dick.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.052
I mean, I did get a laugh out of it.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.885
-Ha, ha...
-But, really, ljust, you know,

21:10.979 --> 21:14.096
wanted to take some time
just for my own research.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.057
And I found that NFL franchise values

21:17.152 --> 21:21.020
have gone up at a ridiculous rate
of 20% per year...

21:21.114 --> 21:23.105
-No shit?
-...and that's worth more than

21:23.199 --> 21:25.064
2.3 billion on average.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.118
Right, and the Raiders in Vegas
would be near the top of that list.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.365
As would the value of the stadium,

21:30.457 --> 21:32.698
which is what we've been
trying to tell you.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.374
Thing is, no one at this bar

21:35.462 --> 21:38.454
is available or capable enough
to run this venture.

21:38.548 --> 21:39.788
I mean, this maniac over here,

21:39.883 --> 21:42.169
he can't go three minutes before
he tells somebody to go fuck themselves.

21:42.260 --> 21:45.468
Well, that "go fuck yourself"
was specifically for you.

21:45.555 --> 21:47.511
Yeah, usually, he's way more subdued.

21:47.599 --> 21:48.634
I don't believe you.

21:49.267 --> 21:50.632
So I'm paying for this thing,

21:50.727 --> 21:53.639
but I will take control.

21:53.897 --> 21:58.391
Okay? We're gonna hire somebody
to oversee the real estate development,

21:58.485 --> 22:00.350
somebody with expertise.

22:00.445 --> 22:04.563
And lwill act as CEO
'cause that's my area of expertise,

22:05.533 --> 22:07.364
and we will all make some money.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.036
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:09.120 --> 22:10.155
That's a very generous offer.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.281
I know.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.697
Now go toddle off
and whisper amongst yourselves

22:13.791 --> 22:15.873

22:27.472 --> 22:29.133
He even drinks like a tool.

22:29.224 --> 22:30.259
Yeah.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.554
All right, this is everything we wanted.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.765
-lt's not what we wanted.
-Not what we want.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.348
It's what everybody wants,
to not do shit and get rich.

22:40.443 --> 22:41.523
That's the American fucking dream.

22:41.611 --> 22:45.650
I started ASM to avoid
that sense of entitlement.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.651
I want to build something
with my own two hands,

22:47.742 --> 22:50.449
with our own two hands,
four hands, six hands.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.620
And I didn't work my ass off
just so I can hand it off to Julian.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.448
Plus, I don't trust that motherfucker
to speak on our behalf.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.538
A moment of clarity, guys, please.

23:00.547 --> 23:03.004
He wants to give us
a lot of fucking money.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.376
It's not about the money, Joe.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.173
Oh, tell Vern that.
Tell Ricky that.

23:06.261 --> 23:07.717
-How much are we in the hole for?
-Millions of dollars.

23:07.804 --> 23:08.884
Millions of dollars, right.

23:08.972 --> 23:11.133
I don't give a fuck.
We don't wanna do business with him.

23:11.224 --> 23:14.842
I'd rather blow up this whole deal
than ever kiss that motherfucker's ring.

Hello.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.017

23:21.109 --> 23:24.727
Actually, we're gonna pass,
little brother.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.733
So you can keep your money.
Or should I say Dad's money?

23:28.157 --> 23:29.863
l doubled Father's money.

23:29.951 --> 23:31.816

will you stop saying "Father"

23:34.205 --> 23:37.368

I'm agreeing to give it to you.

when you've won?

23:40.503 --> 23:43.119
Oh, I know when I've won,
when we've won.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.545
I've done it before.

23:44.632 --> 23:45.792

to put me on the market.

You're gonna quit the job
you fought so hard to keep?

24:31.763 --> 24:33.719
You told me to start
thinking on my own, right?

24:34.098 --> 24:35.508
Well, I thought.
Now it's time to do.

24:35.600 --> 24:39.218
Doing exactly what I told you to do
isn't exactly thinking on your own.

24:40.438 --> 24:42.099
Yeah, I ain't gonna
let that wreck nothing.

24:42.357 --> 24:44.188
Nope, not me.

24:44.484 --> 24:47.191
I'm done. Done being tested.

24:47.862 --> 24:50.148
I'm taking my services
somewhere they're appreciated

24:50.448 --> 24:52.814

fetching coffee and kale chips.

24:53.201 --> 24:54.566
He made you get him kale chips?

24:55.203 --> 24:57.159

in the break room, but still, you know.

something else you wanna add.

That's not a bad idea, but, no.

26:26.002 --> 26:30.996

I am going to sell everything I own,

26:31.090 --> 26:33.502

in Anderson Financial,

26:33.593 --> 26:37.006

on my family trust,

26:41.142 --> 26:42.757

-I am.

26:42.852 --> 26:45.343
You're gonna buy the stadium in Vegas

You heard Julian. It's a great deal.

He might be a stupid fucking prick,
but he's a smart stupid fucking prick.

-Where are you gonna get the cash?
-The bank.

26:53.529 --> 26:57.113

and I'll borrow the rest. Fuck it.
