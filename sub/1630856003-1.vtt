So what's on deck
for the show today?

02:13.635 --> 02:15.704
Well, Brook
is still improvising

02:15.838 --> 02:18.443
and not really listening
to anything that anyone says.

02:18.577 --> 02:20.214
So, I really have no idea.

02:20.347 --> 02:21.482

about the separation.

-Maya!

she won't find out.

02:30.534 --> 02:31.837

anything, seriously.

04:20.888 --> 04:22.224
[Kenzie] Good. Yeah.

04:22.357 --> 04:24.361
I'm a little concerned
that the station

04:24.495 --> 04:26.365

me how I'm doing.

04:26.499 --> 04:27.569

water, wine from my vineyard?

let's get down to it.

04:35.183 --> 04:37.387
We need to lighten up
Breakfast with Brooke.

04:37.522 --> 04:38.925
What do you mean?

04:39.058 --> 04:40.060
Show's not good right now.

04:40.193 --> 04:42.699
It's stale, flat, boring.

04:42.832 --> 04:44.903

used to actually connect

04:45.036 --> 04:47.875
with her fans,
give heartfelt advice.

04:48.009 --> 04:50.180
You know, before
Sheila and I were married.

04:50.380 --> 04:51.516
I used to listen to

04:51.950 --> 04:53.554
the guidance that Brooke
gave her callers on the show,

04:53.688 --> 04:56.627
and I would follow it
to a tee, things like what

04:56.760 --> 05:00.066
to say on a first date
and how to charm a lady

05:00.200 --> 05:02.371
or how to slay an anniversary.

05:02.639 --> 05:04.374
Did I
use that word right? Slay?

05:05.745 --> 05:07.716
-Yeah, I guess.
-[Mark] And it worked!

05:07.949 --> 05:09.619
People loved that Brooke.

05:09.752 --> 05:11.624
Well, I think Brooke would be
honored to know that.

05:11.757 --> 05:13.761
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know. I get. I get it.

05:13.894 --> 05:15.130
I mean, listen.

05:16.032 --> 05:18.971
Brooke is Ann Arbor's number
one morning talk show host.

05:19.104 --> 05:20.575
-Yes, she is.
-Yes.

05:20.708 --> 05:24.248
But, she's been in a bad mood
for about six months now.

05:24.883 --> 05:27.622
She's tight lipped at content
planning meetings.

05:27.755 --> 05:29.960
She stopped giving
genuine advice on air.

05:30.093 --> 05:31.295
She doesn't
show up to the company

05:31.428 --> 05:32.732
get togethers anymore.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.137
Do you have any idea
what's going on with her?

05:35.538 --> 05:37.608
-No.
-No?

05:37.742 --> 05:39.378
-Mm-mm.
-Mm-mm?

05:39.980 --> 05:41.182
No, I don't.

05:41.315 --> 05:43.153
Oh, well,
you're her producer. I mean

05:43.286 --> 05:46.960
don't you have access to her
computer or keys to her house?

05:47.094 --> 05:48.229
Can you find out?

05:48.631 --> 05:50.300
Well, I appreciate that
you just lowkey sort of

05:50.433 --> 05:51.737
just ask me to trespass.

05:51.870 --> 05:53.473
Which I should admit
I'm not willing to do.

05:53.607 --> 05:54.910
Fair enough. Fair enough.

05:55.044 --> 05:56.580
But listen,

05:56.713 --> 05:58.851
we need to fix
whatever is going on here,

05:58.984 --> 06:01.322
because, stat, you
know, the suits

06:01.455 --> 06:04.328
upstairs are breathing down
my neck to get the show back

06:04.462 --> 06:07.835
to where it was before the end
of the Christmas season

06:07.969 --> 06:10.173
or they might consider
cutting.

06:10.307 --> 06:11.577
Oh, no, no.

06:11.710 --> 06:14.582
We are nowhere
near cutting anything.

06:15.517 --> 06:18.991
So I will, um,
I will talk to Brooke

06:19.191 --> 06:21.196
and I'll figure it out.

06:21.329 --> 06:22.599
And then handle it?

06:22.732 --> 06:24.001
And then handle it.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.072
Okay, great. Great. Because,

06:26.339 --> 06:28.911
I would hate to have to cut
my two favorite colleagues

06:29.144 --> 06:31.783
and my wife's favorite show,

06:31.917 --> 06:33.787
that would be...

06:34.789 --> 06:35.691
Not good.

06:36.459 --> 06:38.798
Maybe I would love some wine.

06:38.931 --> 06:40.233
-[Maya] Where are
you going, speedy?

06:40.433 --> 06:41.570
[Kenzie] Uh, to save
my boss's job.

06:41.703 --> 06:43.640
-Wait, what?
-[Kenzie] Um, never mind.

06:44.074 --> 06:45.043
What's up?

06:45.745 --> 06:48.116
-It's Tuesday.
-So?

06:48.551 --> 06:51.489
So, we eat lunch at the cafe
and watch the cuties from legal

06:51.624 --> 06:53.493
eat salads and compete over
who can be the most

06:53.628 --> 06:55.565
-boring on Tuesdays.
-Right. Yes.

06:55.698 --> 06:57.635
I will meet you down there.

06:57.769 --> 07:01.275
What? Don't leave me alone
with hot, boring lawyers!

07:01.408 --> 07:03.045
You know, that's my type.

07:07.989 --> 07:11.563
[gentle music]

07:13.399 --> 07:15.537
-Hey! So--
-Knock next time.

07:16.706 --> 07:19.044
Right. Yes, um.

07:19.946 --> 07:23.520
So, Mark isn't

07:23.654 --> 07:25.858
exactly thrilled with
the state of the show.

07:25.992 --> 07:26.893
[scoffs] Why?

07:27.460 --> 07:29.498
Well, your numbers
have been dropping

07:29.632 --> 07:30.735
and you're not getting

07:31.035 --> 07:33.006
the positive reviews
that you're used to, so.

07:33.139 --> 07:34.676
Well, I do not know what

07:34.809 --> 07:36.846
would be the cause of that,
because I'm--

07:36.980 --> 07:38.850
Okay well, Brooke, he said that
the suits upstairs

07:38.917 --> 07:40.654
are taking notice of you
acting differently.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.291
And I don't want to be
dramatic.

07:42.357 --> 07:44.194
-Well, then don't be dramatic.
-[Kenzie] Because the suits

07:44.261 --> 07:44.996
upstairs are taking notice and
I think our show is in trouble.

07:46.666 --> 07:49.137
-I'm sorry, our show?
-[Kenzie] Yes.

07:50.039 --> 07:52.611
[curious music]

07:57.487 --> 07:58.891
My show.

07:59.091 --> 08:01.195
Well, I've been your producer
for half a decade, so,

08:01.328 --> 08:03.232
you know,
I kind of think...

08:03.365 --> 08:04.869
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

08:05.002 --> 08:06.606
I can't believe it's
been that long.

08:09.512 --> 08:11.215
Oh, you mean about the suits
upstairs?

08:11.348 --> 08:12.251
Yeah.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.689
Um, yes, unfortunately.

08:15.022 --> 08:16.158
But I told Mark
that I would talk to you

08:16.225 --> 08:17.661
and we would come up
with a plan.

08:18.362 --> 08:19.766
And why would you do that?

08:20.433 --> 08:21.903
To save our jobs.

08:22.605 --> 08:25.545
[chuckles] Our jobs are not in
trouble, Kenzie. Trust me.

08:25.678 --> 08:26.947
Brooke, I don't think you're
hearing me.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.085
The suits upstairs, I mean,
this is serious.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.554
I hear you loud and clear.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.494
This is my show.

08:34.629 --> 08:36.566
And if they don't like
what I'm doing,

08:36.699 --> 08:38.503
then we'll take the show
somewhere else.

08:38.637 --> 08:41.376
WGCC, they offered me
a daytime spot.

08:42.144 --> 08:44.683
Yes, but that was like a year
ago, so.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.285
Okay, so we'll just,

08:46.419 --> 08:48.690
why don't you find out
if the offer still stands?

08:49.793 --> 08:51.328
Don't you think
that's a little bit rash?

08:51.663 --> 08:52.832
No.

08:52.965 --> 08:54.602
You would rather leave
the network

08:54.736 --> 08:56.773
that you have been
at for over a decade

08:56.907 --> 08:59.211
instead of telling people
that you and Todd split up.

09:00.313 --> 09:01.950
Maybe.

09:02.084 --> 09:02.919
Brooke.

09:03.353 --> 09:05.925
Kenzie, we have gone over this
a thousand times.

09:06.058 --> 09:07.661
Okay. Well, I think we need
to make it a thousand and one.

09:07.795 --> 09:08.931
Go over it again.

09:09.231 --> 09:11.503
Kenzie, I am not going
to publicly announce

09:11.636 --> 09:13.707
that my husband and I
are separated.

09:13.841 --> 09:16.178
Brooke, people separate
all the time.

09:16.311 --> 09:18.316
Yeah, but Brooke and Todd don't.

09:18.718 --> 09:19.920
Don't
you understand that people

09:20.053 --> 09:22.725
come to me
for relationship advice?

09:22.992 --> 09:24.996
And you think that they wouldn't
if they knew the truth?

09:25.130 --> 09:27.200
Yeah, I think they wouldn't
because they would think

09:27.334 --> 09:28.436
I was a fraud.

09:28.971 --> 09:31.042
No, Brooke, I really think
that people would understand.

09:31.710 --> 09:34.248
Kenzie, do not
bring this up again.

09:34.381 --> 09:35.483
I have made my decision.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.789
-Okay?
-Okay. How about this?

09:37.922 --> 09:40.794
Let's just take lunch
to think about it. Yeah?

09:41.830 --> 09:43.299
You really
don't remember that

09:43.432 --> 09:44.669
I'm intermittent fasting?

09:44.802 --> 09:46.371
I am not having lunch.

09:47.675 --> 09:49.277
[Kenzie] Right.

09:49.411 --> 09:52.217
Well, I'm still eating.

09:52.351 --> 09:54.355
-Well, good for you. Enjoy.
-[Kenzie] Thank you.

09:54.488 --> 09:57.995
So, I'm going to go do that
and then we can circle back.

09:58.129 --> 09:59.131
Sounds good.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.968
[Kenzie] Okay, but we're going
to circle back about this.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.170
Yeah,
I heard you the first time.

10:02.505 --> 10:04.207
Great. Okay.

10:05.845 --> 10:08.750
[footsteps clomping]

10:09.384 --> 10:10.788
Hey, Tawny, what's up?

10:10.922 --> 10:15.096
We just got the exclusive
on the O Wine Bar opening.

10:15.597 --> 10:16.933
We're the first publication

10:17.067 --> 10:18.804
previewing it,
and I need my best guy on it.

10:18.937 --> 10:21.308
I hope you mean me,
because... [chuckles]

10:21.441 --> 10:23.313
Of course, I mean you.

10:23.446 --> 10:24.949
You get guests,

10:25.083 --> 10:27.722
and if I was going to be in
town, I would use my power

10:27.856 --> 10:29.826
as your boss and
make you take me.

10:29.959 --> 10:31.495
You're not going to be missing
a tasting

10:31.563 --> 10:32.932
while you're on your honeymoon.
Come on. [Tawny laughs]

10:33.801 --> 10:35.938
I spoke to Harry
about you the other day.

10:36.405 --> 10:39.612
They're considering
bringing on another executive.

10:39.745 --> 10:41.482
Your name is
at the top of the list.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.188
Oh, yeah. Keep it up.

10:44.623 --> 10:46.024
Who knows? Your name could be

10:46.158 --> 10:47.929
on the masthead
sooner than you think.

10:48.931 --> 10:52.938
-[footsteps clomping]
-[uplifting music]

10:56.278 --> 10:58.851
[Maya] Sam is looking
really good today.

10:58.984 --> 11:00.688
I think that juice cleanse
he's been doing for

11:00.821 --> 11:02.591
the past
three days is really working.

11:02.725 --> 11:04.729
Which one is Sam?
This one here?

11:04.929 --> 11:07.400
No, the cute blonde
guy with the suspenders.

11:07.935 --> 11:10.741
[Kenzie] Right.
I dare you to go talk to him.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.745
There's zero chance of that
happening ever.

11:13.112 --> 11:14.715
-Why?
-[Maya] That would be weird!

11:14.982 --> 11:16.418
And you giving him
a fake name

11:16.553 --> 11:18.990
and paying attention to his
dietary habits, isn't?

11:19.391 --> 11:20.928
Touché.

11:21.663 --> 11:22.898
How'd it go with Brooke?

11:23.265 --> 11:24.367
Um...

11:25.403 --> 11:27.307
I would say
there have definitely

11:27.441 --> 11:30.012
been more successful meetings
in my career.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.016
Yikes.

11:32.183 --> 11:34.088
Mark wants to know why
she's not acting like herself.

11:34.221 --> 11:36.726
-Because of the separation.
-Maya, stop bringing it up.

11:36.860 --> 11:39.431
No one heard me.
Besides, Mark's not wrong.

11:39.765 --> 11:40.834
People are commenting right

11:41.402 --> 11:43.205
and left online about how Brooke
has lost her authenticity.

11:43.339 --> 11:46.145
I'm doing damage control
on social all day, every day.

11:46.613 --> 11:47.749
Why didn't you tell me?

11:48.082 --> 11:49.417
Because I thought
you were handling it,

11:49.552 --> 11:51.121
and I didn't wanna make
the situation worse.

11:51.254 --> 11:52.424
Oh, okay.

11:52.558 --> 11:54.696
Um, on a scale from
one to ten, how bad is it?

11:54.929 --> 11:56.065
Okay, one,
you guys are totally

11:56.199 --> 11:57.669
killing it in the clear
to ten,

11:57.802 --> 12:00.641
you're both fired,
I'd say, I'd say a seven.

12:00.908 --> 12:02.978
-What? What?
-[Maya] Maybe eight.

12:03.112 --> 12:05.818
But, if anyone can fix
a situation, it's you.

12:06.251 --> 12:07.789
Please
don't tell anyone about this.

12:07.922 --> 12:09.190
[Kenzie] Okay.
My lips are sealed.

12:10.393 --> 12:11.896
Oh!

12:14.368 --> 12:16.438
-[Kenzie] Go. Why not?
-No. Because no.

12:16.573 --> 12:18.944
You should, hi sorry,
do you need some napkins?

12:19.679 --> 12:20.914
Uh, yeah. That would be amazing.

12:21.114 --> 12:23.085
Oh, great. She will bring them
over to you.

12:23.218 --> 12:24.689
-Oh, will she?
-Yes.

12:24.822 --> 12:26.491
You'll thank me later.

12:26.626 --> 12:28.964
[quirky music]

12:29.197 --> 12:31.035
-[Maya] Hi.
-[Liam] Hey, thank you.

12:31.169 --> 12:32.505
-[Maya] Here you go.
-[Liam] That's really good.

12:32.705 --> 12:34.341
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Maya.

12:34.542 --> 12:37.781
I'm Liam. I'm an idiot.
[both laughing]

12:38.349 --> 12:39.250
It's okay.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.737
[door knocking]

12:49.037 --> 12:51.041
I need that expense report
before I head out.

12:51.174 --> 12:52.310
Perfect. Got it Right here.

12:56.051 --> 12:57.588
What happened to you?

12:58.055 --> 13:00.393
Oh, that. [chuckles]
Just a little spill.

13:01.028 --> 13:02.831
A little spill that you're
happy about?

13:03.432 --> 13:06.371
The stain, no. But the girl
I met because of the stain?

13:08.042 --> 13:09.945
-She works at WKPC.
-[Mark] Oh.

13:10.514 --> 13:11.683
WKPC?

13:12.183 --> 13:14.956
Yeah, and her name's Maya,

13:15.089 --> 13:18.228
and she works
in the social media team.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.503
Do you know
someone that works at WKPC?

13:21.903 --> 13:24.542
Yeah. No, no, I don't.

13:25.911 --> 13:28.048
Sorry, I actually have to get
back to this. I have a deadline.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.386
Copy. Heard.

13:31.421 --> 13:34.595
-Expense report.
-Yeah, right. Of course. Here.

13:35.463 --> 13:36.666
Cheers.

13:36.800 --> 13:41.610
[gentle music]

13:41.743 --> 13:43.045
[keyboard clicking]

13:44.716 --> 13:47.588
[bright music]

13:59.846 --> 14:01.516
[footsteps clomping]

14:02.551 --> 14:03.920
[door knocking]

14:04.054 --> 14:06.158
Aw, thank you so much
for knocking, come on in.

14:06.860 --> 14:10.166
-Okay. I've been thinking.
-Okay.

14:11.168 --> 14:15.845
And, have you ever online
dated?

14:16.012 --> 14:16.980
-[curious music]
-Sorry. What?

14:17.481 --> 14:22.190
-Todd's dating online. Already.
-Whoa.

14:22.424 --> 14:25.063
[Brooke] Yeah, It's
been, what, only ten months?

14:25.196 --> 14:26.700
Where did you find that?

14:26.833 --> 14:28.670
My friend
Olivia sent this to me.

14:28.804 --> 14:31.342
I mean, if he's doing it,
I should be doing it.

14:31.475 --> 14:32.845
[Kenzie] Wait. Where
are you going?

14:33.312 --> 14:35.082
I'm going to get something
to eat because I'm starving.

14:36.318 --> 14:38.623
Well, I thought you were
intermittent fasting?

14:38.756 --> 14:40.126
[Brooke] Intermittent what?

14:40.928 --> 14:42.097
Are you okay?

14:42.531 --> 14:44.268
Because you've been acting
a little different lately.

14:44.401 --> 14:45.637
Like you're
kind of all over the place.

14:47.207 --> 14:49.110
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
-Good.

14:52.785 --> 14:54.522
What just happened?

14:54.756 --> 14:58.328
[bright music]

15:02.504 --> 15:03.406
[door knocking]

15:04.007 --> 15:05.309
-[Kenzie] Hey.
-Hey!

15:05.710 --> 15:07.948
-[Kenzie] How'd it go with Sam?
-[Maya] Okay. Name's Liam.

15:08.182 --> 15:10.086
-Oh.
-And he doesn't work in legal.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.290
-He works in accounting.
-Oh for two!

15:12.457 --> 15:14.161
-We're terrible at this!
-I know!

15:14.294 --> 15:15.864
And then he asked
for my phone number,

15:15.997 --> 15:17.935
so I guess me and not Sam

15:18.302 --> 15:19.471
are basically married now.

15:20.473 --> 15:22.010
[Maya] What are you working on?

15:22.143 --> 15:23.413
Oh, I'm just trying
to figure out

15:23.547 --> 15:25.449
how to brighten up
Breakfast with Brooke.

15:27.053 --> 15:28.857
[Maya] That looks like it's
going well.

15:29.123 --> 15:31.161
It is. Thank you very much.

15:31.863 --> 15:33.232
Yeah.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.504
Just going back
through the consumer data,

15:35.638 --> 15:37.708
what people love about Brooke
is her advice,

15:37.841 --> 15:40.380
that talking to her feels like
talking to your best friend,

15:40.514 --> 15:41.949
the way they get to connect
with her.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.455
That's why so many
people call in, or,

15:44.589 --> 15:45.625
-used to.
-Hmm.

15:45.758 --> 15:47.027
So you just need her

15:47.160 --> 15:48.830
something to get Brooke back
to being Brooke.

15:49.030 --> 15:51.736
Yes. Or just get her
to open up a little bit.

15:51.870 --> 15:55.242
Okay. I'll give it some thought.
But, onto the real reason

15:55.376 --> 15:56.679
-that I'm here.
-Okay.

15:56.812 --> 15:59.151
We need to get you a date
for the Christmas soiree

15:59.284 --> 16:01.054
because mine's locked
down now, obviously.

16:01.421 --> 16:03.527
Uh, with everything
going on here,

16:03.660 --> 16:06.398
dating is kind of
the last thing on my mind.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.935
Okay, well if you don't have
time to go on dates,

16:08.336 --> 16:09.772
I can set you up on
blind dates.

16:10.507 --> 16:12.778
Come on. Nothing screams romance
like a little pressure.

16:12.912 --> 16:15.416
I would rather be on office,
microwave clean out

16:15.550 --> 16:17.855
duty for the rest of the year
than to go on a blind date.

16:17.989 --> 16:19.525
Ew, really?

16:19.659 --> 16:21.461
Yes. Blind dates are literally
my worst nightmare.

16:21.596 --> 16:23.465
Oh, but the stories that come
after are so good.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.936
Remember
when I went out that one guy

16:25.069 --> 16:26.204
that Karen set me up with?

16:26.338 --> 16:27.575
-Oh yeah!
-[Maya] What was his name?

16:27.708 --> 16:29.845
-It was Jack? John?
-[Kenzie] No.

16:30.714 --> 16:33.018
-[Maya] Jeremy.
-Wait a minute.

16:34.555 --> 16:37.962
That would be a great idea
for Brooke.

16:38.295 --> 16:41.001
Wait, what, set
Brooke up on a date with Jack?

16:41.235 --> 16:42.971
No, no, but yes.

16:43.105 --> 16:47.214
Set Brooke up on
blind dates, on air.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.184
Wait a minute, that could be
good for ratings.

16:49.484 --> 16:51.088
Yes. And it would show her
vulnerable side

16:51.221 --> 16:53.425
and it would give us a banger
for our segment

16:53.560 --> 16:55.029
on the Christmas
Eve live broadcast.

16:55.630 --> 16:57.634
Do you think she'd go
for something like that?

16:57.834 --> 16:59.137
Well, you said so yourself.

16:59.404 --> 17:01.041
The best part about blind
dates are the stories afterwards

17:01.743 --> 17:03.547
and she just found Todd's
dating profile.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.350
So she said she wants
to put herself back out there.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.721
So this
could be kind of perfect.

17:08.890 --> 17:10.225
If I present it the right way.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.163
Well, I will send you
all the positive thoughts

17:12.296 --> 17:14.635
and prayers
that this idea that I came up

17:14.868 --> 17:17.675
with as a joke works out
and saves both your jobs.

17:17.808 --> 17:19.913
And then you can take me out
to dinner and say thank you.

17:20.346 --> 17:22.350
-Deal.
-[Maya] Deal.

17:23.385 --> 17:25.256
Now, where do we find
Brooke a blind date?

17:25.858 --> 17:27.294
No, I understand, I just don't
think we can get the

17:27.427 --> 17:28.597
press release out in time.

17:28.730 --> 17:31.201
Okay. Yeah, right.
All right. Bye.

17:32.170 --> 17:33.773
-Oh! I'm so sorry!
-[items clatter]

17:33.907 --> 17:35.443
-I'm so sorry. Here.
-No. No, that was my fault.

17:35.577 --> 17:36.946
-I wasn't paying attention.
-Here.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.284
[cheerful music]

17:39.586 --> 17:40.988
-[Ben] You have a lot of stuff.
-[Kenzie] Yeah.

17:41.121 --> 17:42.323
[Ben] I think we need
to get you, like,

17:42.791 --> 17:44.427
a bigger bag or one of those
rolling baskets. [Kenzie laughs]

17:44.561 --> 17:45.831
You know, that
trial attorneys have?

17:46.131 --> 17:47.400
Oh! [Kenzie chuckles]

17:48.269 --> 17:49.404
-[Ben] Here.
-[Kenzie] Thank you.

17:51.274 --> 17:52.377
[Ben] I think this is yours.

17:52.511 --> 17:54.314
-Oh, yes.
-Breakfast with Brooke?

17:54.447 --> 17:56.285
Yeah, she's my boss.

17:56.485 --> 17:57.688
Really? My mom loves her show.

17:57.888 --> 17:59.592
[Kenzie] Oh, she gets that
all the time.

17:59.725 --> 18:00.660
And what do you do?

18:00.794 --> 18:02.229
I'm her producer.

18:02.363 --> 18:05.103
-Kenzie. Nice to meet you.
-Ben. Nice to meet you.

18:05.236 --> 18:06.806
[both laughing]

18:07.106 --> 18:08.476
So you work in the building?

18:08.910 --> 18:13.520
Yeah, yeah, I'm just on the
second floor, Topline Papers.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.624
Oh, I love Topline Papers!

18:15.757 --> 18:18.396
I read your site, like, all day,
every day. Don't tell Brooke.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.732
-Secret's safe with me.
-[Kenzie] Okay.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.336
So, what do you do for them?

18:22.604 --> 18:24.474
Lifestyle pieces, "best
of" lists, things like that.

18:24.775 --> 18:27.414
Nice! Do you do any of their
undercover food critic stuff?

18:28.082 --> 18:31.222
No. I wish.
It's all boring stuff.

18:31.355 --> 18:32.625
Ordinary restaurant

18:32.758 --> 18:33.860
openings, menu
changes, things like that.

18:34.461 --> 18:35.864
That doesn't
sound boring at all.

18:35.998 --> 18:36.899
Menu changes sound fun.

18:38.135 --> 18:40.073
Yeah, it's pretty intense.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.509
Especially when
every single restaurant

18:41.642 --> 18:43.746
in Ann Arbor
is updating their menu.

18:44.481 --> 18:45.818
All that free food.

18:46.519 --> 18:49.825
The food is the
best part, yes. [chuckles]

18:50.560 --> 18:53.332
Well, thank you again.
And sorry, again.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.704
Yeah, no problem. Again.

18:56.740 --> 18:57.774
[Kenzie] See ya.

18:58.275 --> 19:01.015

[phone dialing]

19:27.066 --> 19:28.402
Yes. No, Absolutely, Tawny.

19:28.536 --> 19:30.640
I'll get them to you
this afternoon.

19:31.174 --> 19:32.443
[mumbles] As soon
as I can find them.

19:32.678 --> 19:34.948
What? No, I wasn't talking
to you. It's okay.

19:35.082 --> 19:36.653
[phone beeps]

19:36.719 --> 19:37.755
Actually, here, can I call you
back? I have someone calling

19:37.822 --> 19:38.422
on the other line.

19:38.488 --> 19:39.792
[phone dialing]

19:40.359 --> 19:41.629
Ben Covington?

19:41.763 --> 19:42.464
Yes, speaking.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.735
Hi, this is Kenzie Parker.

19:44.869 --> 19:46.706
[Kenzie] We bumped into each
other yesterday, and I think

19:46.839 --> 19:49.410
I accidentally grabbed
one of your papers by mistake?

19:50.479 --> 19:52.450
You don't happen to have one

19:52.584 --> 19:55.289
that's a list of restaurants
that starts with Grayson do you?

19:55.423 --> 19:57.227
Yes, I did. Sorry about that.

19:57.695 --> 20:00.166
No, no, no.
I'm so happy you called.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.472
No problem. Can I get them from
you this afternoon, 1pm?

20:04.141 --> 20:05.009
Just meet in the lobby?

20:05.443 --> 20:06.813
Yes. Works for me.

20:07.815 --> 20:10.352
Perfect. Thank you. Thank
you, Kenzie, for calling.

20:12.791 --> 20:13.893
Oh, shoot.

20:16.833 --> 20:18.603
Good morning.

20:19.003 --> 20:20.507
Morning.

20:21.542 --> 20:22.778
I've been thinking a lot
about what

20:22.911 --> 20:24.247
you said to me yesterday.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.017
Okay.

20:26.151 --> 20:27.186
You're right.

20:28.022 --> 20:30.092
Yeah, you're right.
You're right. You're right.

20:30.226 --> 20:31.361
Don't make me say that again.

20:31.495 --> 20:32.798
It feels so good to
hear you say it.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.434
I know, I know it does.
But, you're right.

20:34.702 --> 20:36.337
The show hasn't been the same.

20:36.471 --> 20:37.541
Because
I haven't been the same.

20:38.008 --> 20:40.681
[Brooke] So, I want you to
talk me through it.

20:41.348 --> 20:44.688
-Through...?
-Your plan to save our show?

20:45.924 --> 20:46.959
Our show?

20:48.863 --> 20:49.965
Yes, our show.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.369
Okay, um.

20:52.504 --> 20:54.241
What is it that listeners love
the most about the show?

20:54.575 --> 20:55.944
That I'm funny.

20:57.146 --> 20:59.117
I was thinking more along
the lines

20:59.250 --> 21:00.721
of how both you
and the listeners

21:00.854 --> 21:02.791
really enjoy it
when you get to connect.

21:02.924 --> 21:03.994
Okay.

21:04.227 --> 21:05.863
All of the data shows
that the listeners love

21:05.997 --> 21:08.469
feeling like they're actually
a part of your life.

21:08.603 --> 21:10.574
They like getting advice
from you while connecting

21:10.707 --> 21:12.611
with whatever it
is that you're going through.

21:14.114 --> 21:16.819
-[Brooke] And...?
-And, I say we give them that,

21:16.953 --> 21:19.658
but on an elevated level,
something really engaging.

21:19.792 --> 21:22.330
-Okay.
-[Kenzie] So with the WKPC

21:22.464 --> 21:23.933
Christmas soiree
right around the corner,

21:24.067 --> 21:28.810
I was thinking that
maybe, um, on today's show,

21:28.943 --> 21:31.381
-[Brooke] Uh-huh.
-you could tell

21:31.515 --> 21:34.722
the listeners about Todd
and the separation.

21:34.855 --> 21:36.592
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I don't know about that.

21:36.726 --> 21:38.830
[Kenzie] Well, wait,
Brooke! I'm not done. Hold on.

21:39.096 --> 21:40.499
And then I would set you up

21:40.634 --> 21:42.705
on a series of live
on-air blind dates

21:42.838 --> 21:44.340
that you would take
in the studio

21:44.407 --> 21:45.811
to find the perfect date for
the company Christmas party.

21:46.111 --> 21:53.559
[suspenseful music]

21:53.993 --> 21:55.664
I love it.

21:55.798 --> 21:57.033
-Yeah?
-[Brooke] I love it.

21:57.167 --> 21:59.671
-Yeah!
-It's young. It's fresh.

21:59.805 --> 22:01.876
See, this is why I hired you.

22:02.811 --> 22:04.214
All right, let's do it.
Let's do it.

22:04.347 --> 22:05.617
-Let's do it.
-[Brooke] Let's do it.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.320
I will do it today.
I will do it today.

22:07.453 --> 22:10.159
We are going to get Breakfast
with Brooke, back to number one.

22:10.292 --> 22:15.135
Yes, we are! Oh my gosh.
She loved it. Oh, she loved it.

22:16.873 --> 22:17.774
[door slams]

22:21.683 --> 22:23.953
Hey, you got this.

22:24.020 --> 22:25.456
And if you don't got this,
that's what I'm here for.

22:25.590 --> 22:27.059
Just give me the signal.

22:28.228 --> 22:30.299
Thank you. [chuckles]

22:30.432 --> 22:33.038
Okay. You are live in five,

22:33.540 --> 22:36.846
four, three...

22:36.979 --> 22:38.616
Good morning, Ann Arbor!

22:38.983 --> 22:41.589
This is Brooke Walkins,
and you are having Breakfast

22:41.723 --> 22:44.060
with Brooke. Okay.

22:44.193 --> 22:46.866
Today's show is going to be
a little different

22:46.999 --> 22:49.070
because there is something
very personal

22:49.204 --> 22:51.107
that I would like to share
with all of you.

22:51.341 --> 22:53.078
[Brooke] I know that a lot of
you have noticed

22:53.212 --> 22:55.082
that I've been acting
different lately.

22:55.216 --> 22:56.919
Well, mainly because
I've seen your comments.

22:57.053 --> 22:58.155
So thank you very much.

22:58.288 --> 23:00.761
I'm glad
that you're very honest,

23:00.894 --> 23:03.264
and I am different
and I apologize.

23:03.398 --> 23:06.706
[Kenzie] The reason being
is because my husband,

23:06.839 --> 23:11.214
Todd and I have decided to
separate earlier this year.

23:11.916 --> 23:16.592
So it was very difficult, um.

23:16.726 --> 23:18.495
You know, Todd's
an amazing man

23:18.629 --> 23:20.499
and a wonderful

23:20.567 --> 23:22.370
[Brooke] father,
but a lot of you,

23:22.437 --> 23:25.610
I'm sure, can relate to this,
that sometimes people

23:25.677 --> 23:29.183
want something different
than what you can give.

23:29.685 --> 23:32.658
I was very hesitant
in telling

23:32.791 --> 23:36.699
all of you because you guys come
to me for relationship advice.

23:37.032 --> 23:39.604
So I felt like,

23:39.738 --> 23:42.109
I don't know, it was hard
for me

23:42.243 --> 23:45.750
to, to share that with you,
but I love all of you.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.857
And anyway, that's
what's been going on

23:49.057 --> 23:51.929
[Brooke] and, I am very sorry
it's taken me this long

23:52.062 --> 23:53.732
to tell you,

23:53.866 --> 23:56.772
but I am in a place
where I'm very excited

23:56.905 --> 24:01.415
to see what my future is and

24:01.716 --> 24:05.089
being open to possibly
meeting someone.

24:05.724 --> 24:10.399
And Kenzie has got something
fun planned for that.

24:10.567 --> 24:13.773
So on to the fun stuff, Kenzie.

24:15.109 --> 24:16.111
Thank you, Brooke.

24:16.546 --> 24:18.850
I commend you for your bravery
and your vulnerability.

24:18.983 --> 24:20.152
Thank you.

24:20.285 --> 24:23.092
But like you said, now
on to the fun stuff.

24:23.225 --> 24:24.961
Listeners of Breakfast
with Brooke.

24:25.095 --> 24:26.297
I need your help.

24:26.431 --> 24:29.003
Our beloved Brooke is single
and ready to mingle

24:29.137 --> 24:33.178
and she needs a date
for the WKPC Christmas soiree.

24:33.411 --> 24:36.518
So, I am going to set
Brooke up on a series of live

24:36.652 --> 24:38.522
on-air blind dates in studio.

24:38.656 --> 24:40.860
Do you know someone who would
be a great fit for our Brooke?

24:41.127 --> 24:42.831
If so, send them my way.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.338
Oh, wow. It looks like you all
have a lot to say about that.

24:46.605 --> 24:48.041
Brooke, what do you
say we take a caller?

24:48.175 --> 24:49.845
Definitely.
Let's take a caller.

24:49.978 --> 24:52.450
Great. Okay. You have
Nancy on line one.

24:53.151 --> 24:55.990
Hi, Nancy. You're having
Breakfast with Brooke.

24:56.324 --> 24:57.459
[Nancy] Brooke, hi.

24:58.027 --> 25:00.365
I think my brother Mike
would be just perfect for you.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.835
[Brooke] Oh, really?

25:02.236 --> 25:03.840
[woman caller] Uh-huh.
Forty-two, never been married.

25:03.973 --> 25:05.910
A doctor, and he loves dogs.

25:06.111 --> 25:08.048
[Brooke] Well, I love that
he loves dogs.

25:08.181 --> 25:12.156
He-- he sounds like he could
be perfect and wonderful.

25:12.289 --> 25:14.895
So I will pass
you back to Kenzie,

25:15.128 --> 25:18.669
my producer, and she will
get his info. Thank you.

25:20.740 --> 25:21.943
Hi, this is Kenzie.

25:22.076 --> 25:24.147
So you want to
nominate your brother?

25:24.280 --> 25:25.415
Okay. What's his name?

25:25.550 --> 25:26.652
Okay, So you really do.

25:26.785 --> 25:27.988
You really thought
it was okay?

25:28.255 --> 25:30.359
Yes. We already have over
a hundred submissions.

25:30.492 --> 25:31.663
-Really?
-A hundred and one!

25:31.796 --> 25:32.865
-Oh, my gosh. Already?
-Yeah. Yes.

25:32.998 --> 25:35.102
[both speaking over each other]

25:35.235 --> 25:36.839
Well, look who it is.

25:37.073 --> 25:39.410
-My dynamic duo.
-[Kenzie] Hey!

25:39.979 --> 25:42.049
So, I listened
to the show today.

25:42.416 --> 25:43.920
-And?
-And?

25:44.053 --> 25:45.723
And I didn't think it was good.

25:46.291 --> 25:47.192
Oh.

25:48.461 --> 25:50.165
-I thought it was great.
-Oh!

25:50.299 --> 25:52.704
It was our highest
rated show this quarter.

25:52.838 --> 25:54.608
We're extending the show
an additional fifteen minutes

25:54.741 --> 25:56.979
until Brooke can find
that perfect date.

25:57.112 --> 25:58.983
-[Mark] Oh, and Kenzie?
-Yes.

25:59.117 --> 26:01.555
You let us know what resources
you need from us.

26:01.688 --> 26:03.526
Background
checks on potential dates,

26:03.659 --> 26:05.530
additional hands on deck.
Let us know.

26:05.830 --> 26:06.932
-Okay, I will.
-[phone vibrates]

26:08.368 --> 26:09.505
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

26:09.771 --> 26:11.742
Thank you so much
for sharing that. Thank you.

26:12.811 --> 26:14.213
Look. I didn't want to say

26:14.347 --> 26:17.554
this in front of Brooke
because, well,

26:17.688 --> 26:19.291
you know how fragile
on-air talent are.

26:19.424 --> 26:20.594
Oh, I don't think that--

26:20.727 --> 26:23.198
Look, the show today,
it was good.

26:24.033 --> 26:25.570
Well you said it was the highest
rated show of the quarter.

26:25.837 --> 26:27.774
It was, but...

26:28.943 --> 26:30.513
This is the first time,
Brooke has spiked

26:30.647 --> 26:32.550
in the ratings
scale in months.

26:32.817 --> 26:34.454
It could just be a fluke.

26:34.588 --> 26:36.090
-Oh, no.
-And if it was,

26:36.525 --> 26:38.862
we'll be having
a much different conversation.

26:39.263 --> 26:41.869
So, we'll let you know
who will be Brooke's date

26:42.002 --> 26:43.773
for the party as we get closer
to it.

26:44.174 --> 26:45.409
Wait, what?

26:45.544 --> 26:47.814
Yeah, I already have Maya
putting together a tracker

26:47.947 --> 26:50.052
to see who polls the best
with our listeners.

26:50.385 --> 26:53.759
We'll pick Brooke's party date
based on the ratings,

26:53.893 --> 26:55.395
you know, give the people
what they want.

26:55.529 --> 26:57.366
A Christmas live broadcast.

26:57.734 --> 26:59.738
Right. But what about Brooke?

26:59.872 --> 27:01.007
What about Brooke?

27:01.141 --> 27:02.544
Well,
what about what she wants?

27:02.611 --> 27:04.147
She gets a date to the party
and she gets to keep

27:04.280 --> 27:05.382
her show on the air.

27:06.017 --> 27:08.556
Now get out there, make that
producer magic happen,

27:08.723 --> 27:11.562
and ensure that Brooke gives us
all that romantic Christmas

27:11.695 --> 27:15.235
magic as she
falls in love on-air.

27:15.369 --> 27:18.208
[gentle music]

27:18.576 --> 27:20.078
Okay.

27:20.814 --> 27:24.220
[footsteps clomping]

27:25.857 --> 27:27.761
Yeah, I thought
we were going to wait.

27:27.895 --> 27:29.030
I know. I'm sorry.

27:29.164 --> 27:30.634
I was going to talk to you
about it.

27:30.767 --> 27:32.236
I just think that it's time
that you and

27:32.369 --> 27:35.944
I accept the fact that we are,
that we're separated.

27:36.211 --> 27:37.313
Look, Brooke,

27:37.446 --> 27:39.016
if you wanted to start
dating other people,

27:39.150 --> 27:40.452
you should have just said
something.

27:40.586 --> 27:42.356
Oh, okay.

27:42.490 --> 27:44.795
So those are the rules
that we're playing by.

27:44.928 --> 27:46.565
Okay, you know what?

27:46.698 --> 27:48.936
I'm at work right
now, and I can't do this.

27:49.905 --> 27:51.742
Okay. Sorry. Goodbye.

27:59.323 --> 28:01.929
Based on the way the listeners
reacted today, I think they are

28:02.062 --> 28:04.300
really excited
for you to find love again.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.004
Okay, if I don't?

28:06.538 --> 28:08.141
We just won't
allow that to be an option.

28:08.474 --> 28:10.580
So the way I see
this working is I will screen

28:10.713 --> 28:11.983
the potential candidates--

28:12.116 --> 28:13.485
You're a little
too excited about this.

28:13.619 --> 28:15.089
And then if they're a good fit,
I will bring them

28:15.222 --> 28:17.393
into the studio
for a live on-air date.

28:17.828 --> 28:20.132
Yeah, that sounds good.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.402
-[gentle music]
-[elevator rings]

28:23.572 --> 28:25.175
-Hi.
-Hi.

28:25.309 --> 28:27.914
-Hey, you.
-Sorry about that.

28:28.148 --> 28:29.918
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

28:30.152 --> 28:31.588
-So sorry.
-No worries.

28:31.722 --> 28:33.593
No worries. How'd the show go?

28:33.926 --> 28:36.097
Uh, good. Yeah.

28:36.599 --> 28:38.603
I'm sure my mom will tell me
all about it tonight.

28:39.137 --> 28:41.474
We do dinner every Wednesday.

28:41.775 --> 28:42.811
This week she picked Zini's.

28:43.278 --> 28:45.215
I love Zini's!
Zini's is the bomb!

28:45.448 --> 28:46.885
-Their eggplant parmesan--
-It's the best!

28:47.019 --> 28:49.323
-Oh my god, it's so good! Yes!
-Right?

28:50.793 --> 28:53.633
So I actually do their menu

28:53.766 --> 28:56.003
tasting
for their seasonal menus,

28:56.137 --> 28:57.674
if you ever want to go,

28:57.807 --> 28:59.476
because, you know,
we both like food.

28:59.744 --> 29:02.049
Oh, yeah. I'd love to.

29:03.118 --> 29:05.288
Great. How's Friday?

29:08.596 --> 29:12.470
Yeah, like this Friday?
Yeah, Friday's good.

29:12.971 --> 29:14.473
Okay, I'll send you
a virtual ticket.

29:15.509 --> 29:16.879
Well, I will let you know

29:17.012 --> 29:19.283
if I have any more
of your papers and stuff.

29:20.052 --> 29:21.822
-Thank you again.
-Yes, sorry about that.

29:22.022 --> 29:23.491
No, of course. Thanks.

29:27.968 --> 29:29.103
Who was that?

29:29.237 --> 29:31.173
[Kenzie] Oh, just a guy.
It's just a guy.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.479
Mister handsome
with the haircut? Hello?

29:33.613 --> 29:35.248
Not-- Maya stop staring!

29:35.382 --> 29:37.386
Physically impossible
because he's' so cute!

29:37.520 --> 29:38.990
Yes, he's cute.

29:39.123 --> 29:41.494
And he goes to dinner
with his mom every Wednesday.

29:42.129 --> 29:43.331
You have to marry him.

29:43.766 --> 29:45.536
Or at least invite him
to the Christmas Eve party.

29:45.670 --> 29:47.607
I am not inviting somebody
I barely know to the company

29:47.807 --> 29:49.678
Christmas party. Plus, I don't
even know if he's single.

29:50.145 --> 29:52.015
But he did invite me
to a tasting at Zini's.

29:52.149 --> 29:54.588
-Hey, sorry to interrupt.
-Oh, no. You're fine.

29:54.721 --> 29:55.890
You're not interrupting.

29:56.490 --> 30:00.165
This is
for you just to say thanks.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.837
I wasn't sure which
to get you, so I just got you

30:02.970 --> 30:06.011
my favorite hazelnut
and peppermint combo.

30:06.646 --> 30:09.651
Well, those are two flavors
I've never thought to mix.

30:10.352 --> 30:12.055
[Liam] It's great.
You're going to love it.

30:12.924 --> 30:14.159
This is best friend Kenzie.

30:14.359 --> 30:16.532
Nice to meet you
best friend, Kenzie. I'm Liam.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.201
Nice to meet you.

30:20.038 --> 30:21.842
I'll let you two get
back to it. See you, Maya.

30:22.209 --> 30:24.179
-Bye.
-Bye.

30:25.315 --> 30:28.187
[both whispering excitedly]

30:32.898 --> 30:34.701
Mm, no.

30:34.834 --> 30:37.006
-Can't be that bad.
-It's bad.

30:37.139 --> 30:39.511
-Oh, that's a crime.
-That's a choice.

30:39.745 --> 30:41.448
-[Kenzie laughing]
-Oh, gosh.

30:42.350 --> 30:46.157
Okay, E.J. Phillips. "I am a
powerhouse of physicality,

30:46.291 --> 30:48.629
and I can often
be found at the gym."

30:49.263 --> 30:51.500
Okay, we're going to pass
on that one.

30:52.135 --> 30:55.009
Randall. "This
bloke is a total riot.

30:55.276 --> 30:57.279
He loves nothing more
than enjoying a cold one."

30:58.248 --> 31:00.519
While you sound very fun
and your beanie is

31:00.653 --> 31:02.256
very festive, I have to pass.

31:02.824 --> 31:05.329
Mike Sanders. "Hi there."

31:05.864 --> 31:07.265
Hi, Mike. You are cute.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.069
"My name is Mike.

31:09.203 --> 31:10.807
I'm an allergist,
recently divorced.

31:10.940 --> 31:12.811
I am looking for someone
special to share my life

31:12.944 --> 31:14.246
with and hopefully
find true love."

31:15.015 --> 31:16.250
I think you might be our guy.

31:16.384 --> 31:17.887
"If you're looking for someone

31:18.154 --> 31:20.125
who is friendly and dedicated,
then I'm your guy."

31:20.258 --> 31:23.565
Yes, you are.
Okay, let's reply to Mike.

31:24.601 --> 31:25.468
"Hi, Mike.

31:25.536 --> 31:27.405
My name is Kenzie Parker

31:27.540 --> 31:30.946
and I wanted to speak to you
about coming in

31:31.080 --> 31:34.855
for a blind date with Brooke.

31:34.988 --> 31:36.558
Are you interested?"

31:37.861 --> 31:39.429
Okay, next.

31:41.735 --> 31:44.306
[gentle music]

31:45.042 --> 31:48.682
[phone vibrating]

31:50.018 --> 31:51.689
Hi, baby.

31:51.822 --> 31:53.024
Hey, Mom.

31:53.157 --> 31:54.728
Wait. Are you still at work?

31:54.861 --> 31:57.399
I know, I am still at work, but,

31:57.533 --> 32:00.105
you know,
I need to wrap up some stuff.

32:00.438 --> 32:02.611
So you're really enjoying
your empty nester life?

32:02.944 --> 32:04.714
No, actually, I'm not.

32:06.250 --> 32:07.654
I just want you
to be happy, Mom.

32:07.788 --> 32:09.290
I am happy.

32:09.423 --> 32:11.494
Well, I have my last final,
in a few days,

32:11.628 --> 32:13.666
so I'll see you guys
next week.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.471
Oh, I miss you.
I can't wait to see you.

32:16.605 --> 32:19.811
Is there any way
that you can come earlier

32:19.945 --> 32:21.581
and spend time with us?

32:21.915 --> 32:23.051
Mom.

32:23.384 --> 32:26.625
I'm sorry. I miss you.
I miss you so much.

32:26.926 --> 32:28.327
What are we doing for
Christmas?

32:28.461 --> 32:30.132
Are we still doing dinner
with Dad?

32:30.265 --> 32:32.069
I don't know how you guys
are doing things since I left.

32:32.603 --> 32:36.277
You know what? I will,
I will call your Dad and

32:36.945 --> 32:38.347
we will figure it out, okay?

32:39.016 --> 32:40.920
Cool. Well, I got to go.

32:41.053 --> 32:42.289
My morning
class is about to start.

32:42.423 --> 32:44.695
I'll see you soon.
I love you so much.

32:44.995 --> 32:46.698
I can't wait to see you.

32:46.832 --> 32:47.734
Love you, Mom.

32:47.834 --> 32:51.440
[gentle music continues]

32:54.814 --> 32:56.518
[phone dialing]

32:58.856 --> 33:00.492
[Todd] Hi. You've reached Todd.

33:00.626 --> 33:01.561
Leave a message.

33:05.670 --> 33:09.276
[gentle music continues]

33:21.300 --> 33:24.507
[upbeat music]

33:25.375 --> 33:26.578
And that's what got me

33:26.711 --> 33:28.916
into collecting
vintage Mason jars.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.151
Right.

33:30.285 --> 33:31.521
I have over three hundred now.

33:31.922 --> 33:32.824
Wow.

33:33.024 --> 33:34.459
I donated a few to the museum.

33:35.395 --> 33:36.297
Cool.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.470
Okay, so, um,
can you tell me what it is

33:39.605 --> 33:41.307
that you're looking for
in a significant other?

33:41.508 --> 33:45.816
Oh! Well, I'm looking for
someone who's giving.

33:46.685 --> 33:47.620
Great.

33:48.054 --> 33:49.958
I live in a studio apartment,
so I donate the majority

33:50.091 --> 33:51.561
of my income to the less
fortunate.

33:52.062 --> 33:53.197
Oh.

33:53.431 --> 33:54.867
Yeah. So, really,
I'm looking for someone

33:55.101 --> 33:57.472
who is totally selfless
and who's cool with a roommate.

33:57.607 --> 33:58.508
Or two.

34:00.747 --> 34:01.915
And so from there,

34:02.048 --> 34:03.786
I backpacked through India.

34:03.919 --> 34:04.821
Where I met my third wife.

34:05.422 --> 34:08.461
-Your third--
-[Steve] Third wife.

34:10.098 --> 34:12.135
Right, um.

34:12.803 --> 34:14.540
How many wives have you had?

34:15.008 --> 34:18.214
Well, I'm hoping Brooke
will be my number five.

34:18.715 --> 34:19.617
Right.

34:27.533 --> 34:32.242
I'm going to go get,
um, something.

34:33.746 --> 34:34.714
[bell jingles]

34:39.190 --> 34:40.425
-Hey.
-Oh, gosh.

34:40.492 --> 34:41.695
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

34:41.762 --> 34:42.697
No, it's okay.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.703
[quirky music]

34:47.606 --> 34:49.978
-Who is that?
-That is a potential blind date.

34:50.111 --> 34:51.748
-A potential?
-Yes.

34:52.248 --> 34:55.222
For Brooke. For the WKPC
Christmas Eve soiree.

34:55.422 --> 34:56.691
-Ah.
-[Kenzie] Mm-hm.

34:58.027 --> 35:00.766
-How's it going? Going well?
-Terribly. It's going terribly.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.336
He hasn't said anything
since he got here.

35:02.469 --> 35:03.606
Absolutely nothing.
It's been silent.

35:03.739 --> 35:04.641
I don't know what to do.

35:05.275 --> 35:06.778
Do you need some help?

35:06.845 --> 35:08.414
You want me to go over there
with you, give you an out?

35:09.283 --> 35:11.287
Yes. Yes, I would.

35:11.588 --> 35:14.126
-Yeah. Operation Blind Date.
-Okay.

35:14.259 --> 35:15.696
-Let's go.
-Okay. All right.

35:18.935 --> 35:21.541
Larry. Crazy coincidence.

35:21.675 --> 35:25.048
This is my friend Ben,
and I totally forgot that,

35:25.181 --> 35:26.785
I told him that I would
help him...

35:26.952 --> 35:28.154
-Water my--
-His cat.

35:36.170 --> 35:38.174
[bell jingles]

35:38.643 --> 35:39.744
[Ben] Okay.

35:41.013 --> 35:43.952
That was easy and awkward.

35:44.086 --> 35:45.923
-Very weird. Very weird.
-Yeah.

35:46.525 --> 35:47.927
-You're kidding.
-No.

35:48.227 --> 35:49.998
A broke college kid's got to do
what a broke college kid's

35:50.131 --> 35:51.233
got to do.

35:54.139 --> 35:57.713
Uh, what is your favorite food?

35:58.147 --> 35:59.584
Easy.

35:59.718 --> 36:01.688
My mother's blueberry pancakes
and scrambled eggs.

36:01.822 --> 36:03.391
Breakfast
food is my favorite, too.

36:03.526 --> 36:04.728
-Really?
-Yes, but bagels

36:04.861 --> 36:06.397
and cream cheese.
Whipped cream cheese.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.736
If you give me plain.
Well, I'll eat it, but I'll

36:08.869 --> 36:10.271
enjoy it like
thirty percent less.

36:10.405 --> 36:11.975
Thirty percent?
That's a specific number.

36:12.108 --> 36:14.614
So you're not a fan of cream
cheese frosting then, are you?

36:14.747 --> 36:16.684
Oh, no. Cream cheese
frosting and cream cheese

36:16.818 --> 36:18.588
are two very different
spreadable categories

36:18.722 --> 36:20.659
that should never be combined
as far as I'm concerned.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.733
I'm sorry. You're just very
passionate about that.

36:23.933 --> 36:26.237
I am. Bagels and cream cheese
are truly the way to my heart.

36:26.371 --> 36:27.941
So if somebody did

36:28.007 --> 36:29.242
want to make you feel special,
they shouldn't send flowers.

36:29.376 --> 36:30.546
They should just send bagels?

36:31.213 --> 36:32.716
-Yes.
-[Ben] Noted.

36:35.656 --> 36:37.225
I'm looking forward
to the tasting tomorrow.

36:38.328 --> 36:40.098
Me too.

36:40.231 --> 36:41.668
Yeah.

36:42.001 --> 36:43.939
Well, I should get going.

36:44.072 --> 36:47.847
Thank you again for getting me
out of that situation.

36:47.980 --> 36:49.984
Saving the day, literally.

36:50.117 --> 36:51.821
-Anytime.
-I appreciate it.

36:52.322 --> 36:55.662
[gentle music]

36:59.270 --> 37:03.111
[soft music]

37:03.746 --> 37:04.947
-[phone vibrates]
-[phone rings]

37:29.664 --> 37:30.966
You okay?

37:33.204 --> 37:34.473
Brooke. Are you okay?

37:34.907 --> 37:37.011
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

37:39.016 --> 37:41.387
Wait, you're not having second
thoughts, are you?

37:41.688 --> 37:43.525
Am I having second thoughts?

37:43.659 --> 37:45.796
No, I'm good. I'm good.

37:46.196 --> 37:49.403
You know, this is something
I need to do and I want to do.

37:49.538 --> 37:51.406
And let's do this.

37:51.908 --> 37:53.445
Yes, you can.

37:53.579 --> 37:55.081
Okay. Are you ready?

37:55.883 --> 37:59.690
We are live in
five four, four, three.

38:01.093 --> 38:02.797
Good morning, Ann Arbor.

38:02.931 --> 38:04.968
You are having Breakfast
with Brooke.

38:05.101 --> 38:09.109
And today we are doing something
that is so fun and different.

38:09.243 --> 38:11.414
My wonderful producer, Kenzie,

38:11.581 --> 38:13.986
came up with this idea
that I can't believe

38:14.119 --> 38:17.392
I agreed to, Brooke's
Blind Dates, where

38:17.526 --> 38:21.034
I will actually be going on
blind dates on-air

38:21.167 --> 38:23.371
live to help me find

38:23.505 --> 38:26.979
the perfect date
for our station's Christmas

38:27.112 --> 38:31.555
Eve party, where we will also
be broadcasting live.

38:31.688 --> 38:34.359
So that's what we're doing.

38:34.492 --> 38:35.462
Are you ready
for the first blind date?

38:35.596 --> 38:37.700
-Yes, I am.
-Okay.

38:37.834 --> 38:39.336
-His name is Chris.
-Okay.

38:39.470 --> 38:40.806
He is forty-two.

38:40.940 --> 38:42.777
He's a single dad
who lives in Birmingham

38:42.911 --> 38:44.547
with his two golden
retrievers.

38:44.681 --> 38:47.485
His son just started
his freshman year at Berkeley.

38:47.620 --> 38:50.158
Okay Chris, you are having
Breakfast with Brooke.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.462
[Chris] Hi. It's so
nice to meet you.

38:52.963 --> 38:55.401
Oh, it's so nice to meet you,
too, Chris.

38:55.536 --> 38:57.673
It sounds like
you probably know

38:57.807 --> 39:00.713
a little bit about me
if you listen to this show.

39:00.846 --> 39:04.119
So maybe tell
me some things about you?

39:06.023 --> 39:08.628
[Brooke] Oh, okay.
Well, that was today's show.

39:08.762 --> 39:11.033
Thank you so much
for all of you

39:11.166 --> 39:12.937
joining me for breakfast.

39:13.906 --> 39:14.875
And the next time

39:15.008 --> 39:17.714
we will all find out who
my blind date

39:17.847 --> 39:20.418
is that my producer Kenzie

39:20.553 --> 39:21.654
has picked for me.

39:22.690 --> 39:25.027
Hey, Chris.
Great job today.

39:25.161 --> 39:28.234
Would you like to go
on a second date with Brooke?

39:28.367 --> 39:29.738
Oh, you would? Fantastic.

39:29.871 --> 39:32.710
Okay, let me give you
some date options.

39:33.277 --> 39:35.649
Yes, I will send these over
right now. Thanks, Chris.

39:36.784 --> 39:38.221
-Hey.
-[Brooke] Hey.

39:38.354 --> 39:39.557
How do you think the show went?

39:39.690 --> 39:41.561
I don't know.
How do you think it went?

39:41.794 --> 39:43.264
I thought it was good.

39:43.397 --> 39:45.167
-You do? Really?
-Yes, I like him a lot.

39:45.401 --> 39:46.538
I think we should

39:46.905 --> 39:49.109
bring him into the studio
for a live on-air date.

39:49.242 --> 39:51.413
Well, you're the producer.

39:51.547 --> 39:54.019
I, I do have to step out.

39:54.153 --> 39:56.123
Oh, but what about our content
planning meeting?

39:56.625 --> 39:58.929
I need to push it
to, like, six-ish.

39:59.062 --> 40:00.933
-Six-ish.
-Six-ish.

40:01.067 --> 40:03.070
That's not going to be
a problem.

40:03.204 --> 40:04.306
-Right?
-Right.

40:04.541 --> 40:06.443
-Yeah. Six-ish is fine.
-Yeah, thank you.

40:06.578 --> 40:09.316
-I'm excited about this.
-Yeah. Good show today.

40:09.449 --> 40:10.553
[Brooke] Thank you.

40:10.686 --> 40:14.426
[curious music]

40:21.841 --> 40:25.081
[faint vintage music]

40:25.348 --> 40:28.454
-Oh.
-Someone's in a good mood.

40:30.257 --> 40:32.530
Yeah, sorry. I didn't realize
anyone was here.

40:32.664 --> 40:35.536
That's okay, man.
I know that dance.

40:35.903 --> 40:38.041
Either you got a promotion,
which I know hasn't happened yet

40:38.174 --> 40:40.880
but I do hear is coming.

40:41.515 --> 40:43.685
So if it's not that.
What's her name?

40:44.621 --> 40:46.992
-[Ben] No.
-Come on.

40:47.258 --> 40:48.996
Come on, I know you too well.
There's someone.

40:49.496 --> 40:50.565
Tell me, what's her
name? Come on.

40:50.699 --> 40:52.503
I'm not
ready to share her name.

40:53.705 --> 40:55.241
Okay, I hear you.

40:56.176 --> 40:57.613
Well, if she's got you doing
the Ben

40:57.813 --> 40:59.517
happy dance, then
she must be pretty special.

41:00.685 --> 41:02.589
Yeah, I think she might be.

41:03.692 --> 41:07.498
[curious music]

41:12.576 --> 41:14.580
-[Todd] Oh.
-Hey.

41:14.814 --> 41:16.016
What are you doing here?

41:16.951 --> 41:18.320
I thought you were at work.

41:18.454 --> 41:19.256
Well, I'm not.

41:19.322 --> 41:21.226
Yeah, well, Ava

41:21.359 --> 41:22.997
called me and told me there's
a leak underneath the sink.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.334
-Oh.
-We all know how you put off

41:25.468 --> 41:26.604
home repairs
to the last minute.

41:26.738 --> 41:27.940
Yeah, we do.

41:28.274 --> 41:31.380
-But it's because I'm busy.
-[Todd] Right. Yeah.

41:31.915 --> 41:34.252
So I thought I'd fix it before

41:34.385 --> 41:35.555
it became an actual problem.

41:36.591 --> 41:38.293
Well, thank you.
That was very nice of you.

41:38.427 --> 41:39.463
[Todd] Of course.

41:39.597 --> 41:42.569
So, I heard the show today.

41:43.237 --> 41:44.641
-You did?
-Yeah.

41:44.774 --> 41:46.911
I'm glad you're
getting out there.

41:48.247 --> 41:49.784
Thank you.

41:49.917 --> 41:52.288
I'm glad you're
getting out there, too.

41:52.422 --> 41:56.731
[gentle music]

41:57.332 --> 42:00.806
So, things are good?

42:01.406 --> 42:03.377
Their wonderful. Can't you tell?

42:04.112 --> 42:06.350
-Yeah, you look--
-[Brooke] I'm joking.

42:06.818 --> 42:08.622
I'm actually not. Things are so
different right now,

42:09.289 --> 42:12.095
but I am working really hard
to try to find a better

42:12.228 --> 42:15.802
balance
between work and life.

42:17.138 --> 42:18.775
You've been
saying that for years.

42:20.211 --> 42:21.647
I know I have. I am.

42:21.881 --> 42:24.754
I'm sorry
that it's taken me so long.

42:25.088 --> 42:27.894
[birds chirping]

42:28.127 --> 42:30.699
I've always wanted
you to be happy,

42:30.833 --> 42:31.768
you know that.

42:31.902 --> 42:34.273
I know. [chuckles]

42:34.507 --> 42:36.845
[birds continue chirping]

42:37.613 --> 42:41.220
Well, you're here, and
you already unlocked my door.

42:41.353 --> 42:43.423
Do you want to come in
for a minute?

42:43.558 --> 42:45.094
I'd love that.

42:45.227 --> 42:46.965
Okay. Good. Come in then.

42:47.933 --> 42:50.237
-Let me get that for you.
-Well thank you so much.

42:52.074 --> 42:54.747
-[Brooke] Glad you're here.
-[door slams]

42:55.616 --> 42:59.958
[suspenseful music]

43:00.225 --> 43:02.729
-[phone vibrating]
-[phone rings]

43:07.139 --> 43:12.014
[soft music]

43:27.546 --> 43:31.588
Do you remember when she became
so obsessed with those poppers

43:31.721 --> 43:33.725
that your Mom
would have at Christmas?

43:33.859 --> 43:35.027
My mom came back from England?

43:35.161 --> 43:36.764
-Yes, I remember that.
-Yes. Yes.

43:36.897 --> 43:40.037
And then Eva wanted it
at every single holiday.

43:40.171 --> 43:41.607
And your Mom? She's so sweet.

43:41.741 --> 43:43.377
She even had it
for Saint Patty's Day

43:43.512 --> 43:45.749
with the little green
shamrock.

43:45.882 --> 43:49.823
-She's, she's amazing.
-[phone vibrating]

43:50.357 --> 43:51.827
[Brooke] Sorry.

43:53.998 --> 43:55.367
Just give me a second.

43:56.403 --> 43:58.340
[footsteps clomping]

43:58.909 --> 44:03.718
[gentle music]

44:21.654 --> 44:22.823
Thank you.

44:41.628 --> 44:46.136
[uplifting music]

44:57.560 --> 44:59.897
[footsteps clomping]

45:02.268 --> 45:05.742
Todd, my meeting was canceled,
but I thought maybe

45:05.875 --> 45:09.015
we could find those poppers
and surprise Ava.

45:16.062 --> 45:17.566
That would be amazing.

45:17.699 --> 45:19.402
-[Brooke] Really?
-Yes.

45:21.473 --> 45:22.375
[Todd] Of course.

45:26.885 --> 45:28.821
[footsteps clomping]

45:29.222 --> 45:30.725
Hi. Hi.

45:30.859 --> 45:33.798
-I am so sorry I'm late.
-Hi. No worries.

45:35.201 --> 45:36.538
-Everything okay today?
-[Kenzie] Yes.

45:36.905 --> 45:39.042
Yes, everything's great.

45:39.175 --> 45:41.413
Oh, okay.

45:41.548 --> 45:42.783
They started driving on

45:43.217 --> 45:45.422
the lake with the jet ski,
and I'm on these pool noodles.

45:45.556 --> 45:47.727
I, I ate it so bad.

45:47.860 --> 45:49.564
It's not a real story.
Are you serious?

45:49.697 --> 45:51.032
Yes, one hundred percent.

45:51.166 --> 45:52.401
I mean, they were
the cool kids at summer camp.

45:52.536 --> 45:54.339
I believed them.
I thought it was possible.

45:55.107 --> 45:57.245
I am so sorry
that that happened to you.

45:57.947 --> 46:00.786
I was okay.
Water is mildly forgiving.

46:01.153 --> 46:02.321
I had a lot of fun.

46:02.388 --> 46:04.025
It was wonderful.
It was a good time.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.102
Well, Mr. Fancy Food Writer man.

46:09.235 --> 46:11.406
Do you have anything else
fun lined up after this?

46:13.110 --> 46:14.814
I actually am going to be
doing the tasting

46:14.947 --> 46:17.385
for the new O Wine Bar
that's opening up.

46:17.586 --> 46:20.458
Oh, cool. That's the Danson
brother's place, right?

46:21.093 --> 46:23.063
Yeah. Yeah.
How did you know?

46:23.632 --> 46:24.533
Are you a foodie?

46:25.467 --> 46:26.804
Aspiring.

46:28.440 --> 46:29.576
That's a thing.

46:29.710 --> 46:31.881
I am allowed a guest
if you want to join me.

46:33.016 --> 46:35.922
-I mean, if--
-Yeah, yeah. I mean...

46:36.056 --> 46:37.225
I mean,
I don't know if there's, like,

46:37.358 --> 46:40.330
somebody who deserves it
more than me.

46:40.899 --> 46:43.404
Deserves it, what?

46:43.738 --> 46:45.776
Yeah, like a girlfriend or,

46:45.909 --> 46:48.548
I don't know,
some special person.

46:50.652 --> 46:51.955
There's no girlfriend.

46:52.021 --> 46:53.424
And the only one
special in my life is my mom.

46:54.459 --> 46:58.033
That's so cute. [chuckles]
You're so cute.

47:01.841 --> 47:02.976
So, I mean,
if you don't want to go--

47:03.110 --> 47:04.614
No, no, I do. I do.
I do want to go.

47:04.747 --> 47:06.884
I do. I would. I, yes.

47:07.017 --> 47:08.453
-Yeah.
-Okay, great.

47:08.588 --> 47:10.357
Because I think it'd be a
lot more fun with you there.

47:14.098 --> 47:17.740
-[phone vibrating]
-Oh, sorry.

47:18.140 --> 47:20.445
I have a ninety-seven alarm
set to remind me

47:20.579 --> 47:22.783
to do some writing
for the show tonight.

47:22.916 --> 47:24.520
Some questions
for the blind dates.

47:26.891 --> 47:28.193
Brooke keeps you pretty busy.

47:29.162 --> 47:31.834
Yeah, but I'm happy to do it.

47:32.101 --> 47:33.403
Brooke works
better from an outline

47:33.538 --> 47:35.375
and makes the show flow
better.

47:35.509 --> 47:37.445
Plus, this blind date
thing is kind of

47:37.679 --> 47:39.984
the most important thing
that we've ever done.

47:40.117 --> 47:42.288
So I want to make sure
that it is perfect.

47:42.422 --> 47:43.725
She's very lucky to have you.

47:44.259 --> 47:46.229
Well, I'm lucky to
work on a hit show.

47:47.633 --> 47:50.304
Have you ever thought
about having your own show?

47:50.438 --> 47:52.642
Just a talk show. I think you'd
make a great host.

47:53.679 --> 47:56.584
No, I mean,

47:56.718 --> 47:58.253
yeah, I've like,

47:58.387 --> 48:00.692
like, maybe thought
of thought, but I don't know.

48:00.826 --> 48:01.961
No, no, I'm, I'm,

48:02.094 --> 48:03.865
I'm a behind the scenes gal.

48:03.998 --> 48:05.903
It's just, that's how
it's always been.

48:06.203 --> 48:07.338
Plus,
I don't think anybody would

48:07.472 --> 48:09.175
really care
about what I had to say.

48:09.309 --> 48:10.879
That's
absolutely not true.

48:11.013 --> 48:12.148
I'd care what you have to say.

48:13.050 --> 48:14.520
Really?

48:14.653 --> 48:16.657
I think you have
a lot of great things to say.

48:19.830 --> 48:24.472
Well, that's very sweet.
Thank you. This was very nice.

48:26.744 --> 48:28.380
Thank you, again.

48:29.584 --> 48:31.486
No problem. Again.

48:34.927 --> 48:35.962
So, did you like
the cheesecake

48:36.096 --> 48:37.331
or the chocolate cake better?

48:37.733 --> 48:39.637
Which one's getting the
the five star review from Mr.

48:39.770 --> 48:41.339
Fancy Food Writer man?

48:42.041 --> 48:43.845
Oh, my gosh,
you have to invite Ben

48:43.978 --> 48:45.114
to the Christmas Eve party.

48:45.247 --> 48:47.251
He's totally into you.

48:48.053 --> 48:50.224
Come on.
It'd be so romantic.

48:52.328 --> 48:54.767
Okay. Yeah, I'll invite him.

48:54.900 --> 48:56.336
I'm so happy for you.

48:57.071 --> 48:58.775
What if he doesn't say yes?

48:58.908 --> 49:00.210
He's going to say yes.

49:01.313 --> 49:03.450
Do you think
he's going to say yes?

49:03.718 --> 49:04.887
[Maya] Yes, he will.

49:05.087 --> 49:06.356
[both laughing]

49:06.891 --> 49:10.732
[nutcracker clacks]

49:11.233 --> 49:13.604
Can I help you with
something, Maya?

49:15.240 --> 49:18.347
Right, um. Okay,
so I was thinking.

49:19.015 --> 49:20.585
Me and Liam should coordinate,
right?

49:20.719 --> 49:22.889
Like I'll get him a sparkly
pink tie to match what I'm

49:23.023 --> 49:24.793
wearing or a vest.

49:25.260 --> 49:26.631
Liam would look fire in a vest.

49:26.764 --> 49:28.367
[Kenzie] I call dibs on
officiating this wedding.

49:28.702 --> 49:31.272
-[Maya] Duh!
-Oh, no.

49:33.878 --> 49:35.281
[Kenzie] Wait, what?

49:35.615 --> 49:38.420
[Maya] What?
Let me see, let me see!

49:39.523 --> 49:42.094
Oh, it's him.

49:42.428 --> 49:44.198
That's your new hottie.

49:44.800 --> 49:48.574
Oh. Why is he applying
to go on a date with Brooke?

49:48.708 --> 49:49.810
I don't know.

49:50.310 --> 49:52.414
Wait, was he just using you
to get to Brooke?

49:54.953 --> 49:57.191
Of course he isn't into me.
He is into Brooke.

49:57.324 --> 49:58.962
Well, I mean,
that was just one theory.

49:59.095 --> 50:00.497
Why else would he submit
an application?

50:01.199 --> 50:03.069
Is the whole thing filled out?

50:03.203 --> 50:04.239
Maybe it was a mistake.

50:04.372 --> 50:05.942
"Hi, my name is Ben.

50:06.075 --> 50:07.946
I'm 37,
and I work as a lifestyle

50:08.079 --> 50:09.650
writer for Topline
Papers. I'm

50:09.783 --> 50:11.553
looking for someone to join me
on this journey of life. Someone

50:11.687 --> 50:15.093
who is up for adventure, romance
and a little spontaneity.

50:15.227 --> 50:17.165
Someone who is fun loving, who

50:17.298 --> 50:19.468
I can share
new experiences with."

50:20.805 --> 50:22.877
Well, um.

50:23.010 --> 50:24.312
If he
wants to go out with Brooke

50:24.445 --> 50:25.782
so bad, let's
just give him what he wants.

50:25.915 --> 50:27.252
-You sure?
-No.

50:27.385 --> 50:28.788
But I do need
to get back to work

50:28.922 --> 50:31.426
because Brooke has her in-studio
dates this week, so.

50:31.560 --> 50:33.130
Okay, well, I'm sending you
all the good vibes

50:33.263 --> 50:34.934
to find a little holiday
romance.

50:35.836 --> 50:37.772
That doesn't involve the guy
that you have a crush on.

50:39.376 --> 50:42.549
-Right. Thanks. Bye.
-[Maya] Bye!

50:46.322 --> 50:47.559
-[Maya groans]
-[laptop thuds]

50:48.127 --> 50:51.767
[gentle music]

50:53.638 --> 50:56.009
Wait. You've never changed
your own tire?

50:56.143 --> 50:57.579
No, and I know, I know.

50:57.713 --> 51:01.052
I do pride myself on not
having any handyman skills.

51:01.185 --> 51:03.992
You know, my hus-- um.

51:04.192 --> 51:06.731
Actually, I hire
someone to do that stuff.

51:06.864 --> 51:08.166
Well,

51:08.299 --> 51:11.106
I'd be happy to teach you
the basics sometime.

51:11.239 --> 51:12.642
Maybe we could grab dinner,

51:12.776 --> 51:14.846
and then I could teach
you how to check your oil.

51:14.980 --> 51:18.286
[eerie music]

51:18.955 --> 51:20.224
[Chris] That was a joke.

51:20.358 --> 51:23.297
I'd love
to just take you to dinner.

51:23.430 --> 51:25.200
[Brooke] Your joke wasn't funny.

51:26.604 --> 51:29.610
[Chris] I meant I'd rather
take you to dinner.

51:30.545 --> 51:32.315
Sounds like your
daughter is really amazing.

51:32.448 --> 51:34.520
Oh, she is. Thank you.

51:34.653 --> 51:37.424
Honestly, I never
thought I would have kids.

51:37.892 --> 51:40.364
Oh, so you don't like kids?

51:40.498 --> 51:42.670
No. I mean, I didn't say
I don't like kids.

51:42.803 --> 51:44.707
Since
I just put my career first.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.145
[Brooke] Oh, because I have a
career my child suffered?

51:47.278 --> 51:48.614
That's not what I meant at all.

51:48.748 --> 51:50.619
It kind of came off that way,
I have to say.

51:50.752 --> 51:52.689
[Greg] When was the last time
you got a sound bath?

51:53.825 --> 51:54.693
[Brooke] A what?

51:54.760 --> 51:56.797
You aura is a bit dirty.

51:58.200 --> 52:00.638
-My what?
-Your aura.

52:03.210 --> 52:04.579
It's messy.

52:06.349 --> 52:07.686
My aura is dirty?

52:10.191 --> 52:11.426
Repeat after me.

52:13.030 --> 52:17.438
Ohm.

52:18.708 --> 52:20.410
I just don't understand
what the problem is.

52:20.545 --> 52:22.114
I just don't like any of them.

52:22.248 --> 52:23.518
Okay, but can you tell me why?

52:24.419 --> 52:27.225
Other than,
"Your aura is dirty" guy.

52:28.093 --> 52:29.730
Okay. Yeah, that one was weird.
I'll give you that.

52:29.863 --> 52:31.801
But the other two,
they seem nice?

52:31.935 --> 52:33.638
-What's wrong with them?
-I don't know. I don't know.

52:33.771 --> 52:35.307
I just,
I just think that we need

52:35.441 --> 52:36.744
another gimmick
for our segment.

52:36.877 --> 52:38.681
Okay, well,
it's a little late for that.

52:38.814 --> 52:41.754
We need to stick with
what we've got or...

52:42.421 --> 52:44.826
-Kenzie.
-There is one more guy.

52:44.960 --> 52:47.164
Look, I appreciate everything
you're trying to do.

52:47.297 --> 52:49.102
One more day, please.

52:49.736 --> 52:51.540
I know that
I can give you the perfect one

52:51.673 --> 52:53.310
and give our listeners
and our bosses

52:53.444 --> 52:54.814
exactly what they want.

52:54.947 --> 52:57.217
You. Romance. Christmas.

52:58.654 --> 53:02.929
-Fine. One more.
-Great. One more date.

53:03.765 --> 53:05.200
One more date.

53:06.102 --> 53:08.675
[gentle music]

53:09.142 --> 53:10.578
[footsteps clomping]

53:36.429 --> 53:37.900
[phone dialing]

53:38.033 --> 53:39.435
[phone ringing]

53:42.943 --> 53:45.948
Hi. This is Kenzie Parker
from Breakfast with Brooke.

53:46.617 --> 53:47.519
Hey you.

53:48.420 --> 53:51.459
We received your
application and--

53:51.995 --> 53:53.196
I'm sorry. What?

53:53.698 --> 53:56.169
Your application from the WKPC

53:56.303 --> 53:58.240
site to go on a date
with Brooke?

53:58.373 --> 54:00.044
Anyway, our team
reviewed your profile,

54:00.177 --> 54:03.116
and we think that you would be
a good fit for Brooke.

54:03.250 --> 54:05.856
Anyway, I just wanted to let
you know that our team

54:05.989 --> 54:07.625
was pushing your application
to the next round,

54:07.759 --> 54:10.363
so I will be in touch to set
up a date.

54:10.497 --> 54:11.867
Talk to you soon.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.537
Hello?

54:14.172 --> 54:19.348
[gentle music]

54:37.485 --> 54:39.523
[footsteps clomping]

54:39.957 --> 54:41.259
Thank you.

54:41.660 --> 54:44.699
Mm. This looks delicious.

54:44.833 --> 54:46.068
Thanks.

54:46.803 --> 54:48.373
I'm sorry I was late again.

54:48.508 --> 54:50.578
I took Maya drink after work.

54:50.712 --> 54:52.615
It's fine. That's fine.

54:52.749 --> 54:54.151
The game doesn't start for
another thirty minutes,

54:54.285 --> 54:55.387
you're okay.

54:56.857 --> 54:59.162
Are you?

54:59.295 --> 55:00.464
You just seem like you're

55:00.598 --> 55:02.000
really falling
for this girl, huh?

55:03.771 --> 55:06.442
I'd be lying
if I said I didn't.

55:06.577 --> 55:09.749
That's great. That's great.
And I'm happy for you.

55:09.883 --> 55:11.286
So how about you?

55:11.419 --> 55:12.789
How's things with mystery girl?

55:13.991 --> 55:15.628
She must work in our office
building.

55:15.762 --> 55:17.966
She'd be wearing far
too much cologne to do the work.

55:18.100 --> 55:19.570
[both chuckling]

55:20.572 --> 55:23.042
Yes, I completely misread
that situation, actually.

55:24.211 --> 55:25.414
You know, she called today

55:25.480 --> 55:26.784
to set me up on a date
with her boss.

55:26.918 --> 55:27.919
Wait, what?

55:28.386 --> 55:31.359
Yeah. The radio shows doing
this whole blind date thing.

55:32.028 --> 55:33.932
Anyway.

55:34.132 --> 55:37.739
Turns out, I think she was just
vetting me for her boss, so.

55:39.408 --> 55:40.578
Are you going to go?

55:42.582 --> 55:44.285
What, on the blind date?

55:44.418 --> 55:45.755
No. I mean, I don't know.

55:45.889 --> 55:47.258
She was really pushing for it.

55:47.893 --> 55:50.364
It sounds like
you might be doing

55:50.497 --> 55:53.036
mystery girl a favor
if you do.

55:53.838 --> 55:55.007
Who is her boss?

55:55.809 --> 55:59.149
Brooke
Walkins and mystery girl.

55:59.282 --> 56:00.317
She's no longer a mystery.

56:00.450 --> 56:02.255
It's her producer, Kenzie.

56:02.388 --> 56:03.758
Best friend, Kenzie.

56:03.891 --> 56:05.562
I think I met her with Maya
and Brooke Walkin.

56:05.695 --> 56:07.565
She's a legend.

56:07.899 --> 56:09.235
You've got to go.

56:09.469 --> 56:12.107
And maybe then
we can do double dates.

56:13.644 --> 56:15.548
Come on. It'll be fun.

56:15.815 --> 56:20.157
I have tons of fun
in my life. Ask Mr. Bubbles.

56:20.658 --> 56:22.629
-Loads of fun.
-[Liam] Yeah, totally.

56:23.565 --> 56:24.498
And the groundhog
on Groundhog's Day

56:24.633 --> 56:26.536
is always right.

56:31.847 --> 56:34.219
I hoped I'd find you here.

56:34.520 --> 56:36.857
Well,
I am a creature of habit.

56:39.061 --> 56:41.032
Excited for your phone date
with Brooke today?

56:41.265 --> 56:42.836
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

56:42.969 --> 56:44.438
Turns out everyone in
my family is a big,

56:44.573 --> 56:45.975
big fan of hers.

56:46.108 --> 56:48.079
Well, there's a
lot to be a fan of.

56:48.714 --> 56:50.719
I think you two are
going to be a great fit.

56:50.919 --> 56:52.087
I can feel it.

56:52.454 --> 56:53.924
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

56:54.125 --> 56:57.565
So just be yourself,
and I know Brooke will love you.

56:59.603 --> 57:00.972
[Kenzie] See ya.

57:03.276 --> 57:06.016
Okay, I guess it's
that point in the show

57:06.449 --> 57:09.054
for Brooke's Blind Dates.

57:09.188 --> 57:11.426
Kenzie, do we have one?

57:11.560 --> 57:13.163
We have Ben Covington.

57:13.296 --> 57:14.766
He is thirty-eight.

57:15.233 --> 57:17.471
He is a lifestyle writer
for Topline Papers,

57:17.605 --> 57:19.475
and he's a really great guy.

57:19.609 --> 57:21.178
He sounds very interesting.

57:21.312 --> 57:23.584
Yes. Yes.
And he is on the line.

57:23.717 --> 57:26.189
Ben, you are having Breakfast
with Brooke.

57:26.456 --> 57:27.693
[Ben] Well, hey there.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.865
Hey, Ben. It's so great
to meet you on-air.

57:31.165 --> 57:34.172
[Ben] It's nice to on the air,
meet you, too.

57:34.305 --> 57:35.708
Thank you.

57:35.842 --> 57:36.910
[Ben] Kenzie speaks really
highly of you.

57:36.977 --> 57:38.580
Oh, thank you.

57:38.714 --> 57:40.316
Actually,
I pay her to do that.

57:40.450 --> 57:42.088
[Ben laughing]

57:42.288 --> 57:44.058
[Ben] The natural way, by far,
is the most important thing

57:44.191 --> 57:45.595
in any home.

57:45.729 --> 57:47.264
[Brooke] No, I absolutely
disagree with that.

57:47.331 --> 57:48.968
The size of the kitchen
is the most important thing

57:49.035 --> 57:50.203
in a home.

57:50.270 --> 57:51.272
[Ben] Hey, size
isn't everything.

57:51.339 --> 57:52.775
[Mark laughs]

57:53.242 --> 57:55.147
[Ben] I love to cook.
I think cooking

57:55.214 --> 57:57.519
is one of the most romantic
things you can do with someone.

57:57.652 --> 57:59.322
I do, too.

57:59.388 --> 58:01.660
I love cooking with someone.

58:02.027 --> 58:03.731
So what's favorite thing
to make?

58:03.865 --> 58:05.835
[Ben] My Mom's blueberry
pancakes.

58:06.035 --> 58:07.605
Where are you
on the scale for breakfast food?

58:08.006 --> 58:09.944
Even though
my show is Breakfast

58:10.077 --> 58:13.584
with Brooke,
I kind of skip breakfast.

58:13.717 --> 58:15.387
[Ben] You skip breakfast
with yourself?

58:15.522 --> 58:16.456
Yeah, I do.

58:16.590 --> 58:17.726
[both laughing]

58:18.159 --> 58:19.495
[Ben] I do love a good bagel,
though.

58:19.630 --> 58:20.832
[Brooke] Oh.

58:21.332 --> 58:22.769
[Ben] It's hard to deny
like a fresh baked bagel.

58:22.903 --> 58:24.105
Do you like bagels?

58:24.238 --> 58:25.374
Yes, sir. No, I agree.

58:25.642 --> 58:27.311
He's the best choice
for Brooke.

58:27.979 --> 58:29.883
Perfect. Okay.
I will let them know now.

58:30.317 --> 58:31.787
Thank you.

58:43.076 --> 58:44.646
[phone dialing]

58:44.779 --> 58:48.587
-[phone vibrating]
-[phone ringing]

58:50.356 --> 58:51.593
Hey, you.

58:53.162 --> 58:54.666
[clears throat]

58:54.799 --> 58:57.137
[Ben] Are you happy with
how it went today?

58:57.270 --> 58:58.373
Very.

58:58.439 --> 58:59.743
So much so that we would like
to bring you

58:59.877 --> 59:01.780
in for a live in-studio date.

59:01.914 --> 59:03.818
Do you have any availability
this upcoming weekend?

59:03.951 --> 59:06.088
[Ben] You know Kenzie,
if you don't want me to--

59:06.222 --> 59:08.292
I do. Like I said,
I think you and Brooke are

59:08.426 --> 59:11.600
a great fit, so
I'll email you some options.

59:12.201 --> 59:13.571
Okay. Talk soon.

59:13.705 --> 59:18.079
-Okay, bye.
-[soft music]

59:21.386 --> 59:22.856
How do you shred it?

59:23.023 --> 59:25.694
You freeze it first and then
just take a cheese grater.

59:25.828 --> 59:28.066
-The way that the fats meet.
-Oh my gosh, I didn't.

59:28.199 --> 59:30.336
-That makes so much sense!
-Incredible. I'm telling you.

59:30.470 --> 59:32.542
Hopefully it saves you
a few more hours than me.

59:32.675 --> 59:33.577
Oh, my gosh. I can't wait.

59:33.644 --> 59:35.013
Good morning.

59:35.147 --> 59:37.084
Oh, morning.

59:37.217 --> 59:38.152
Morning.

59:38.286 --> 59:40.525
Morning. Hey. Um.

59:40.658 --> 59:42.060
Should we go to the studio?

59:43.564 --> 59:44.498
Sounds like our cue.

59:44.632 --> 59:45.734
Great.

59:48.407 --> 59:49.409
You coming?

59:49.543 --> 59:51.078
[Brooke] Eventually.

59:51.412 --> 59:54.719
[footsteps clomping]

59:55.922 --> 01:00:00.731
Okay. We are
live in five, four, three.

01:00:02.267 --> 01:00:03.637
Good morning, Ann Arbor.

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:06.644
You are listening
to Breakfast with Brooke.

01:00:06.777 --> 01:00:10.518
And we have a very
special show for you today.

01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:12.254
We have Ben here.

01:00:12.454 --> 01:00:13.925
Thank you, it's actually really
nice to

01:00:14.225 --> 01:00:16.362
-finally be here in person.
-Thank you for coming.

01:00:16.495 --> 01:00:17.932
Thank you both for having.

01:00:18.099 --> 01:00:21.339
[Brooke] The listeners were
very excited about you.

01:00:21.472 --> 01:00:24.411
Well, it's nice not to get
voted off the island so early.

01:00:24.546 --> 01:00:26.315
Exactly right.
Well, thank you.

01:00:27.785 --> 01:00:29.221
I came prepared

01:00:29.355 --> 01:00:31.527
to ask you a couple questions,
if that's all right.

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:32.795
Oh, really?

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:34.331
I love that.
I think it's great.

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:36.268
-Let's just cut to the chase.
-Right?

01:00:36.837 --> 01:00:38.105
So Christmas.

01:00:38.205 --> 01:00:39.175
-[Brooke] What about it?
-[Ben] It's coming up.

01:00:39.242 --> 01:00:40.310
It is coming up.

01:00:40.376 --> 01:00:44.118
And since you boldly said
size matters.

01:00:44.185 --> 01:00:45.453
[Brooke] Yes.

01:00:45.521 --> 01:00:48.660
[Ben] Big light bulbs
or little light bulbs?

01:00:48.727 --> 01:00:51.165
-[Brooke] I like, um, both.
-Both?

01:00:51.232 --> 01:00:54.171
Yes, I like to mix it up
a little bit.

01:00:54.539 --> 01:00:56.075
What are your other questions?

01:00:56.209 --> 01:00:58.614
[Ben] I was curious
how you feel about presents.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.918
When's the right time to
open them?

01:01:01.052 --> 01:01:03.256
Is it at Christmas Eve?
One present kind of thing?

01:01:03.389 --> 01:01:06.296
Okay, so
when my daughter was younger,

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:09.603
I definitely waited
until Christmas morning.

01:01:09.736 --> 01:01:10.938
Oh, you have a daughter?

01:01:11.072 --> 01:01:12.441
-[Ben] Yeah?
-[Brooke] Oh, yeah.

01:01:12.576 --> 01:01:14.779
No, it's amazing. I actually
really admire that.

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:18.754
It's incredible for you to have
your own show and to still

01:01:18.988 --> 01:01:21.158
take care of the family life
and it's really beautiful.

01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:22.829
-Thank you. So, um.
-I really admire that.

01:01:22.962 --> 01:01:24.498
You don't have kids?

01:01:24.633 --> 01:01:26.402
I don't have any children. No.

01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:28.172
[Brooke] And never been married?

01:01:28.305 --> 01:01:31.780
I don't know if I should share
that on the air.

01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:37.224
So I was engaged once,

01:01:37.357 --> 01:01:39.461
and it obviously didn't
work out.

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:40.765
I'm here.

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:43.804
We decided to part ways
amicably.

01:01:43.938 --> 01:01:45.708
So we're still friends.

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:48.146
And we just grew apart.

01:01:48.346 --> 01:01:53.089
[uplifting music]

01:02:00.505 --> 01:02:03.343
Okay. And that's all the time
that we have for today.

01:02:03.477 --> 01:02:04.779
Oh, already?

01:02:04.912 --> 01:02:06.583
I feel like
I could talk to you for hours.

01:02:06.716 --> 01:02:07.852
-Yeah. Likewise.
-All righty.

01:02:07.986 --> 01:02:09.388
Well,
I got to wrap up the show.

01:02:09.522 --> 01:02:10.892
Don't take those off yet.

01:02:11.025 --> 01:02:15.534
I'm sure all of our listeners
are loving Ben.

01:02:16.101 --> 01:02:18.975
Of course. So, it was so great
to meet you in person.

01:02:19.275 --> 01:02:21.513
Thank you so much for coming.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.584
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:02:23.718 --> 01:02:25.988
That's it for our show today.

01:02:26.122 --> 01:02:27.726
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Great job, guys.

01:02:27.893 --> 01:02:29.963
Great, great show.
Great show. Okay.

01:02:30.364 --> 01:02:31.967
Yeah, we're out.

01:02:32.903 --> 01:02:34.739
She seems
to be in a bit of a hurry.

01:02:34.872 --> 01:02:37.244
Sorry, but thank you again.

01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:41.519
[gentle music]

01:03:02.027 --> 01:03:03.096

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:04.498
Come in.

01:03:05.534 --> 01:03:06.603
[Kenzie] What's wrong?

01:03:06.736 --> 01:03:08.507
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.644
I mean, we're,
we're saving the show, so.

01:03:10.778 --> 01:03:12.414
That's good.

01:03:12.915 --> 01:03:14.484
Well, then
why do you look so miserable?

01:03:14.619 --> 01:03:16.021
I don't know.

01:03:16.623 --> 01:03:19.061
I really like Ben. I do.

01:03:20.598 --> 01:03:22.434
But he's not Todd.

01:03:24.171 --> 01:03:26.309
I didn't realize that
Todd was an option.

01:03:26.442 --> 01:03:27.612
Well, he's not.

01:03:27.845 --> 01:03:30.417
I mean, he's obviously
and clearly moved on from me.

01:03:30.551 --> 01:03:32.220
You saw his profile.

01:03:32.354 --> 01:03:34.058
As long as I'm committed
to the show

01:03:34.191 --> 01:03:35.995
and to the broadcast, he,

01:03:36.128 --> 01:03:38.132
he doesn't
want to do it again, so.

01:03:39.402 --> 01:03:40.403
I don't blame him.

01:03:40.537 --> 01:03:42.073
Well,
have you told him that you're

01:03:42.207 --> 01:03:43.476
having second thoughts
about the separation?

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:44.546
No, I haven't.

01:03:44.679 --> 01:03:46.282
I mean, I made my bed

01:03:46.415 --> 01:03:50.891
choosing the show,
so I got to, I got to lie in it.

01:03:51.492 --> 01:03:53.964
-[door knocking]
-[Mark] Ladies.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:55.668
Great news.

01:03:56.001 --> 01:03:58.406
The station has picked your
date for the Christmas soiree.

01:03:58.808 --> 01:04:01.145
Ben, the writer from Topline.

01:04:01.279 --> 01:04:03.984
-Hmm. That's so great.
-So great.

01:04:04.118 --> 01:04:05.889
And we're already talking
to Topline

01:04:06.022 --> 01:04:07.658
about a potential partnership
for more

01:04:07.792 --> 01:04:09.729
Brooke and Ben content.

01:04:09.862 --> 01:04:13.703
So this could be huge
for all of us.

01:04:13.837 --> 01:04:18.012
So just carry on and business
as usual. All right.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:23.022
Okay. Well, the listeners,
they want a Christmas romance,

01:04:23.155 --> 01:04:25.493
so let's give them a Christmas
romance, right?

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.932
Right. Yes.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.738
All right. Well, okay.

01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:32.541
Give me Ben's info, please.

01:04:32.675 --> 01:04:36.381
I want to make this
as real as possible and

01:04:36.516 --> 01:04:38.152
whatever. Who knows?
Maybe there's something there.

01:04:38.687 --> 01:04:39.756
With us, right?

01:04:39.956 --> 01:04:41.225
Right. Yes. Yes, of course.

01:04:41.593 --> 01:04:42.862
Okay.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:44.532
[Maya] So who'd they pick?

01:04:44.665 --> 01:04:45.567
I'm not telling you that.

01:04:45.901 --> 01:04:47.037
Why not?

01:04:47.104 --> 01:04:48.106
You have to find out
at the Christmas

01:04:48.239 --> 01:04:50.076
soiree like everybody else.

01:04:51.445 --> 01:04:52.948
It's Ben.

01:04:54.819 --> 01:04:56.455
They're picking Ben.

01:04:57.559 --> 01:04:58.527
Oh, my gosh.

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.296
-And your feelings for him.
-What?

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:03.335
No, I don't have feelings
for him. I don't.

01:05:04.872 --> 01:05:08.245
Okay, I like maybe might be
in the vicinity of considering

01:05:08.379 --> 01:05:11.252
having feelings for him,
but no, he's, he's

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:12.955
the station's pick, so I'm not
going to tell him that

01:05:13.089 --> 01:05:15.193
-I have feelings for him.
-Ha! So you admit it.

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:19.736
I think that's so sweet
and super romantic.

01:05:19.869 --> 01:05:21.105
Doesn't matter how I feel.

01:05:21.238 --> 01:05:22.474
I have to do
what's best for the show.

01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:24.278
-What's best for Brooke.

invite you to the company

as Brooke Walkins' date.

send over all the details.

have been through the roof

have really taken notice.

you know, just in the building

You don't still want to go
to the tasting at O Wine Bar

01:07:39.616 --> 01:07:40.483
tonight, do you?

01:07:41.252 --> 01:07:45.728
Oh, no, I probably shouldn't.

No. Yeah, of course.

01:07:48.433 --> 01:07:49.635
[Ben] Makes sense.

Kenzie, is, is everything okay?

01:07:59.923 --> 01:08:01.526

to still come.

you went home for the night.

for the broadcast tomorrow.

how live events can be.

I guess. Technically, yeah.

01:09:17.711 --> 01:09:19.381
But my parents don't fly
until Christmas morning,

01:09:19.682 --> 01:09:21.452
and Brooke works
better from an outline,

01:09:21.586 --> 01:09:23.156
so why not fill the time
with work?

01:09:23.289 --> 01:09:24.759
She's lucky to have you.

01:09:25.226 --> 01:09:28.165

the perfect date for the party.

to remind you of the stakes.

You need to bring the romance.

I know you, son.
What's going on?

01:10:03.469 --> 01:10:04.772
I have a lot on my mind.

01:10:04.972 --> 01:10:07.678
Would it have to do
with a certain radio host?

01:10:07.811 --> 01:10:09.815
It seems like the two of
you really hit it off.

01:10:09.949 --> 01:10:13.388
I mean, of course I voted for
you on the WKPC website

01:10:13.523 --> 01:10:16.495
and I told all the ladies
at pickleball to vote, too.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:19.400
Thank you, Mom. Thank you.

01:10:21.038 --> 01:10:22.541
I like Brooke a lot.

01:10:22.675 --> 01:10:24.579
She seems like a great woman,

01:10:24.712 --> 01:10:28.520
but I don't know all that
fashion pizzazz.

01:10:28.654 --> 01:10:31.225
Well, she's a celebrity,
you know?

01:10:31.358 --> 01:10:33.597
I mean, don't get me wrong,
It is very cool.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.635
But the more I think about it,
the more I'm

01:10:35.768 --> 01:10:38.372
just not
sure she's the woman for you.

01:10:39.041 --> 01:10:40.443
What makes you say that?

01:10:40.511 --> 01:10:41.580
Look, you don't light
up when you talk about it.

01:10:41.746 --> 01:10:43.951
You get a bit excited. Sure.

01:10:44.084 --> 01:10:46.288
But do you light up? No.

01:10:47.023 --> 01:10:48.492
But it was worth a shot.

01:10:48.626 --> 01:10:50.162
I mean, she is a local celebrity

01:10:50.296 --> 01:10:51.398
I had to try.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.502
What do you mean?

01:10:53.637 --> 01:10:55.674
Like you don't think they just
plucked you out of thin

01:10:55.807 --> 01:10:58.412
air to go on a date
with Brooke, do you?

01:10:58.547 --> 01:10:59.883
I thought her producer
set me up.

01:11:00.016 --> 01:11:03.055
Her producer?
Honey no, I submitted you.

01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:05.694

form and everything.

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:07.931
Did a mighty good job of it.
If I say so myself.

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:11.171
No, I'm sorry, backup, what?

01:11:11.304 --> 01:11:12.642
What did you just say?

01:11:12.775 --> 01:11:14.979
Pickleball ladies and I
were brainstorming on

01:11:15.112 --> 01:11:17.250
who we could submit to go
on the blind date with Brooke?

01:11:17.384 --> 01:11:18.352
It was fun.

finish the tasting for me?

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:24.632
How do I finish the tasting?

01:11:24.932 --> 01:11:26.736
Just, they're going to bring you
out food.

01:11:26.803 --> 01:11:28.339
I need details on the menu,
pick a few items that you like,

01:11:28.506 --> 01:11:30.043
Write about them here. Okay.

01:11:30.176 --> 01:11:32.080
I'm going tell the manager
that you're going to do this.

01:11:32.213 --> 01:11:33.382
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

01:11:33.516 --> 01:11:34.752
I love you. Thank you.

01:11:34.818 --> 01:11:36.088

'll let the manager know.

-My mom.

She submitted the application
to go on a date with Brooke.

I felt silly thinking

01:11:57.564 --> 01:11:58.867

that had feelings for you

and that you didn't
have feelings for me.

on a date with Brooke.

go through with it, Kenzie.

01:12:07.585 --> 01:12:08.887
I do want you to.

What? Why?

You are the only person
who even remotely hit

01:12:15.433 --> 01:12:16.903
it off with her.

01:12:16.969 --> 01:12:18.272
And she said she might
actually be interested in you.

01:12:18.406 --> 01:12:19.509
I mean, she texted you right?

01:12:20.176 --> 01:12:22.815
No, no, she didn't text me,
and it wouldn't matter.

01:12:22.948 --> 01:12:24.752
Listen, I know that
this is important to you,

01:12:24.885 --> 01:12:28.092
so, yes, I'll go to the party
as her date.

01:12:28.225 --> 01:12:29.562
Then.

01:12:29.695 --> 01:12:31.632

the potential partnership

01:12:38.881 --> 01:12:40.817

like you two together.

This is the best thing
for our careers.

I'm sorry. Am I really the only
one that's feeling this?

I can't get

01:12:50.136 --> 01:12:51.672
you out of my head.

01:13:04.398 --> 01:13:05.601
And you're the station's pick.

01:13:05.734 --> 01:13:08.338
I can't, I won't
go against that.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.344
You and Brooke,
you have a lot of chemistry.

01:13:11.712 --> 01:13:13.015
This is the best thing
for the show.

01:13:13.148 --> 01:13:14.518

-No, no, I can't.

01:13:14.652 --> 01:13:16.188
I can't forget the show, Ben.

01:13:16.623 --> 01:13:17.792
You're the only viable,

here.

But I've worked
way too hard for this.

I'm not going to let
some silly crush derail that.

It will ruin everything.

01:13:34.057 --> 01:13:35.727

thing that ever happened.

how the real world works.

How are you?

Todd? Hi. Good.

-Well.

This Christmas, it's,
it's different.

01:14:31.772 --> 01:14:33.976
Yeah. You're even online dating.

01:14:34.745 --> 01:14:36.114
-What?
-Oh, I, uh,

01:14:36.247 --> 01:14:38.485
I found your dating profile
in doing research

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:39.855
for the show.

01:14:39.988 --> 01:14:41.225
Oh, that?

01:14:41.358 --> 01:14:42.662
Jim in my office did that.

01:14:42.795 --> 01:14:44.632
He did it as a joke.

01:14:44.765 --> 01:14:46.234
I thought he took it down.

01:14:47.103 --> 01:14:48.072
Wait, what?

01:14:48.472 --> 01:14:51.277
Yeah, I'm not looking to date or
I don't even want to.

You know, what maybe it's time.

01:14:54.151 --> 01:14:56.856
If online dating is good
for Brooke,

01:14:56.989 --> 01:14:58.626
maybe it'll be good for me.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.731
Yeah. Yeah. No, no,
You don't need online dating.

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:02.133
You're, you're good. Yeah.

01:15:02.266 --> 01:15:03.870
I mean, unless you want you,
but maybe don't.

01:15:04.004 --> 01:15:06.041
Okay. It was good to see you.

01:15:06.576 --> 01:15:07.745
Merry Christmas?

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:10.015
Yes. Merry Christmas, Todd.

01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:11.552
-[Todd] Yeah.
-Merry Christmas. Okay.

01:15:11.686 --> 01:15:12.788
See ya later.

-Hey.
-Hey.

01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:19.869
Okay, so I was thinking,
what are you wearing tonight?

01:15:20.003 --> 01:15:22.173
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe jeans?

01:15:22.674 --> 01:15:23.843
What? You can't wear jeans.

01:15:23.977 --> 01:15:25.581

What are you wearing?

01:15:27.283 --> 01:15:28.754
Okay, I was thinking
this blue dress with, like, a

01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:32.661

been subtle.

Okay. Or this hot pink pantsuit?

01:15:36.569 --> 01:15:38.539
Okay.
We could get ready together.

01:15:40.544 --> 01:15:42.279
Hello?
Hey. What's wrong?

01:15:42.647 --> 01:15:43.917
What?

01:15:44.051 --> 01:15:46.021
Oh, nothing.

01:15:46.155 --> 01:15:47.624

[soft music]

01:15:51.265 --> 01:15:53.803
-I ran into Todd.
-Brooke's ex Todd?

01:15:53.936 --> 01:15:56.207
Yes, and he said that he didn't
make the dating profile.

01:15:56.341 --> 01:15:58.078
One of his coworkers did. So.

01:15:58.913 --> 01:16:00.216
So?

01:16:00.349 --> 01:16:02.754
So, Brooke thinks that Todd
made himself

01:16:02.888 --> 01:16:04.725
the dating profile
and that he is online dating.

01:16:04.859 --> 01:16:06.763
That's why she agreed
to go on the blind dates.

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.700
She wouldn't have done it
if he wasn't actually dating.

01:16:08.833 --> 01:16:11.137
You can't tell her. Why not?

01:16:12.072 --> 01:16:13.510
Okay.
You didn't hear this from me,

01:16:13.877 --> 01:16:15.614
but Megan in advertising
told me she was talking

01:16:15.747 --> 01:16:17.651
to Karen in accounting
about how the suits

01:16:17.785 --> 01:16:19.655
are pretty set on cutting
Brooke from the lineup

01:16:19.788 --> 01:16:21.592
if this whole partnership
with Topline doesn't

01:16:21.725 --> 01:16:24.431
go well. It's bringing in a
lot of money for the station.

01:16:24.565 --> 01:16:27.303
And if she knew that Todd
wasn't actually online dating,

01:16:27.436 --> 01:16:29.207
that would blow
everything up with Ben.

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.778
So if you want to
keep your show on-air,

01:16:30.911 --> 01:16:32.246
you can't tell her.

01:16:32.781 --> 01:16:35.052
At least wait till after
the Christmas party?

01:16:36.823 --> 01:16:39.060
-Oh boy.
-Yeah.

01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:41.699
So, the pantsuit?

01:16:41.933 --> 01:16:43.335
Yeah. Okay.
I'll see you later.

01:16:43.469 --> 01:16:44.671
See you later.

and I met.

but we would

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:34.170
call it our "Met Day,"
and we would celebrate it

And we would get the little
table by the window. And

01:17:43.355 --> 01:17:45.793
every year I would fall
more and more in love with him.

Oh, I really thought
he was my soul mate.

01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:56.214
I mean, how do you let
your soul mate, slip away?

01:17:56.347 --> 01:18:00.556
But I did, because I'm
so focused on my career

01:18:00.690 --> 01:18:03.162
and this show.

[Liam] What?

01:19:40.289 --> 01:19:41.726
Said I was more than welcome
to go to the party.

01:19:41.859 --> 01:19:44.397
Just not as Brooke's
official date.

01:19:45.065 --> 01:19:49.574
Oh, you're still going
to go, though. Right?

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:53.583
What, to the party? No, no.

01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:56.589
Come on, let's throw a suit on
and go

01:19:56.722 --> 01:19:59.093
and celebrate a little bit
of Christmas magic.

01:20:00.062 --> 01:20:02.635
Maybe a little holiday
romance.

01:20:03.168 --> 01:20:04.771
I think I'm a holiday
romance-d out.

01:20:04.905 --> 01:20:07.143
Thank you very much, but no,
thank you.

01:20:07.276 --> 01:20:09.447
But as much as I love the idea
of being a third wheel

01:20:09.582 --> 01:20:11.518
to you and Maya,

01:20:12.587 --> 01:20:14.157
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

01:20:14.357 --> 01:20:16.195
You could just make it up with
Kenzie, then you'd be on your

01:20:16.328 --> 01:20:18.933
own, totally dependable,
two wheeled bike.

01:20:20.069 --> 01:20:21.437
I don't think that's
going to happen.

01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:25.212
Are you sure?

01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:27.449
Yeah. You're
not going to win this one.

01:20:28.853 --> 01:20:30.255
All right.

01:20:31.258 --> 01:20:33.428
Go. You look great.
Look at you.

01:20:34.765 --> 01:20:35.834
[Ben] You look great.

01:20:35.967 --> 01:20:37.169
Okay, man.

01:20:37.637 --> 01:20:38.840
I know you do enjoy

01:20:38.973 --> 01:20:40.610
a Friday evening in
with your fish.

01:20:40.744 --> 01:20:41.679
It's Mr. Bubbles,

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:44.350
and you know that
you know his name.

[Maya] I love the tie.

01:20:56.241 --> 01:20:58.044
[Kanzie] Perfect.
It looks perfect.

01:20:58.980 --> 01:20:59.982
You go.

01:21:00.115 --> 01:21:01.518
-No, you go.
-No, no, no.

01:21:01.652 --> 01:21:03.355
Please, please. You go.

01:21:03.556 --> 01:21:05.192
Thank you.

01:21:05.325 --> 01:21:08.733
Well, I've been going on
these blind dates

01:21:08.867 --> 01:21:10.436
through the show, and--

01:21:10.570 --> 01:21:11.872
Yeah.

01:21:12.006 --> 01:21:13.943
I've listened every broadcast.

01:21:14.077 --> 01:21:16.048
-You do?
-Of course!

01:21:16.181 --> 01:21:18.118
I wouldn't
miss an episode of your show.

01:21:18.753 --> 01:21:20.222
It's been really good.

01:21:20.356 --> 01:21:21.658
-Thank you.
-[Todd] Yeah.

01:21:21.792 --> 01:21:26.067
You seem so relaxed. Engaged.

01:21:26.468 --> 01:21:28.338
-[Brooke] Thank you.
-Hopeful.

01:21:30.577 --> 01:21:32.479
I haven't seen
you like this in years.

01:21:32.948 --> 01:21:35.921
So if dating

01:21:36.054 --> 01:21:39.493
makes you feel
that way, then, please--

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.430
Babe. It doesn't.

01:21:42.768 --> 01:21:43.937
You do.

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:46.073
You make me feel that way.

01:21:48.411 --> 01:21:49.114
And, yes,

01:21:49.615 --> 01:21:51.051
I've gone on dates
with some great guys.

01:21:51.184 --> 01:21:53.022
But they're not you.

01:21:53.155 --> 01:21:55.727
They're not my Todd.

01:21:55.861 --> 01:21:58.399
I miss us so much.

01:21:58.533 --> 01:21:59.768
I feel the same way.

01:21:59.902 --> 01:22:01.037
-You do?
-Yeah.

01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:02.808
I feel like
the last few months

01:22:02.941 --> 01:22:04.276
I haven't been myself.

01:22:04.946 --> 01:22:06.080
I felt like

01:22:06.214 --> 01:22:09.120
the biggest piece
of me was missing.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:13.128
Todd, I know
I made such a big mistake.

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:17.838
I know I have thrown my
everything into my work

01:22:17.971 --> 01:22:21.077
and the station
and the show when

01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:24.684
I needed to throw a lot of it
into you.

01:22:27.958 --> 01:22:29.426
You know, you're
my dream girl, right?

01:22:31.164 --> 01:22:33.301
You know,
you're my dream guy, right?

01:22:34.004 --> 01:22:35.305
I love you.

01:22:35.974 --> 01:22:37.677
I love you, too.

01:22:40.884 --> 01:22:45.492
Well. I think we have a
Christmas Eve party to go to.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:46.996
I think we do.

01:22:47.496 --> 01:22:49.534
-Shall we?
-We shall.

01:22:49.701 --> 01:22:51.939
[people chattering]

01:22:52.072 --> 01:22:53.543
All right, party people.

01:22:53.676 --> 01:22:56.915
T-minus two minutes
till showtime, now.

01:22:57.049 --> 01:22:59.220
Does anyone have eyes
on Brooke?

01:22:59.353 --> 01:23:01.525
[Kenzie] Yeah,
She'll be here in a minute.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:03.696
Okay.

01:23:05.031 --> 01:23:06.467
Okay.

01:23:06.602 --> 01:23:07.604
I love you.

01:23:08.004 --> 01:23:11.110
And in case this doesn't go
well and I lose my job,

01:23:11.244 --> 01:23:12.781
it's been amazing
working with you.

01:23:12.914 --> 01:23:14.084
And I'll fill you in later.

01:23:14.217 --> 01:23:15.119
Okay. Wish me luck.

01:23:15.252 --> 01:23:16.922
[Maya] Wait, Kenzie, what?

01:23:17.524 --> 01:23:20.028
-[footsteps clomping]
-What is she talking about?

01:23:20.797 --> 01:23:22.266
All right.

01:23:22.399 --> 01:23:24.638
We are live in five,

01:23:24.772 --> 01:23:27.744
four, three.

01:23:29.047 --> 01:23:30.115
Good evening, everyone,

01:23:30.249 --> 01:23:33.321
and welcome to the annual
WKPC

01:23:33.455 --> 01:23:35.593
Live Christmas Eve broadcast.

01:23:35.726 --> 01:23:37.463
Thank you so much
for joining us this evening,

01:23:37.597 --> 01:23:39.400
ladies and gentlemen.
[people applauding]

01:23:45.111 --> 01:23:46.515
My name is Kenzie Parker,

01:23:46.649 --> 01:23:50.455
and I am the producer
of Breakfast with Brooke.

01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:52.226
You might be wondering
where Brooke is

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.898
and who she picked for her
blind date.

01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:58.005
Was it the funny Chris

01:23:58.138 --> 01:24:00.042
or the charming Ben?

01:24:00.175 --> 01:24:01.444
[woman] What about Keith?

01:24:02.045 --> 01:24:03.448
Sound bath guy!

01:24:04.450 --> 01:24:07.155
Or sound bath guy? Yes.

01:24:08.458 --> 01:24:11.397
The truth is, it's
none of them,

01:24:12.066 --> 01:24:13.034
because none of them

01:24:13.168 --> 01:24:15.339
were the right fit for Brooke.

01:24:16.041 --> 01:24:19.314
I was pushing Brooke to do
something

01:24:19.447 --> 01:24:23.556
instead of encouraging her
to follow her heart.

01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:26.027
I thought that
if I could set Brooke up

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:28.165
with the perfect situation
to fall in love,

01:24:28.298 --> 01:24:31.705
that it would fix all of our
show's problems.

01:24:33.274 --> 01:24:34.744
But I know
that's not the case.

01:24:34.878 --> 01:24:37.382
So I did something else

01:24:37.517 --> 01:24:40.289
and set her up with someone
else. Who,

01:24:40.422 --> 01:24:42.961
I will let her share that
information.

01:24:43.095 --> 01:24:44.497
What is she doing?

01:24:45.065 --> 01:24:46.535
She's saving the show.

01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:49.406
Oh, here she is.
Everybody, Brooke Walkins.

01:24:50.075 --> 01:24:55.118
[people applauding]

01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:57.724
Thank you so much.

01:24:58.191 --> 01:24:59.460
Thank you so much
for being here.

01:24:59.594 --> 01:25:01.397
You're all very wonderful.

01:25:01.532 --> 01:25:03.603
And I also need to give it up

01:25:03.736 --> 01:25:06.240
for my fabulous

01:25:06.374 --> 01:25:08.378
producer, Kenzie.

01:25:08.513 --> 01:25:11.050
I really would not be here
if it weren't for her.

01:25:11.184 --> 01:25:12.654
She is incredible.

01:25:12.787 --> 01:25:16.695
She came up with this
crazy idea that you all loved.

01:25:16.828 --> 01:25:20.368
So thank you so much, Kenzie,
for that.

01:25:20.502 --> 01:25:23.375
And the truth is,
she actually helped me so much

01:25:23.509 --> 01:25:27.349
because these
dates made me realize that

01:25:27.482 --> 01:25:30.488
I had the perfect
guy right in front of me.

01:25:30.623 --> 01:25:32.493
And I know a lot of
you know of him because I have

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:35.666
spoken about him
many times on the show.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.173
And I'm very happy to say
that we are back together.

01:25:39.306 --> 01:25:41.578
And it is my husband.

01:25:42.012 --> 01:25:47.189
[people cheering]

01:25:50.897 --> 01:25:55.171
There is, though,
someone that does need a date

01:25:55.539 --> 01:25:58.144
-that is very close to me.
-Brooke.

01:25:58.278 --> 01:25:59.915
-Yes?
-What are you doing?

01:26:00.049 --> 01:26:01.519
Just go with it.

01:26:01.852 --> 01:26:04.725
I actually noticed
a little connection with her

01:26:04.858 --> 01:26:07.564
and the guy that was there
to be my date.

01:26:07.697 --> 01:26:10.669
Wait, is she talking about Ben?

01:26:11.839 --> 01:26:13.208
I want to introduce,

01:26:13.341 --> 01:26:16.615
because you all loved him
on the show. Ben.

01:26:16.849 --> 01:26:19.386
[people applauding]

01:26:20.956 --> 01:26:22.627
You'll thank me later.

01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:28.840
Hi, Kenzie.

01:26:29.273 --> 01:26:31.444
I was wondering
if you had a date

01:26:31.578 --> 01:26:34.684
to the WKPC
Christmas Eve soiree?

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.124
So it turns out I don't,

01:26:38.357 --> 01:26:39.961
but I would love one.

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:44.737

[upbeat Christmas music]

01:27:04.644 --> 01:27:06.515
Thank you again,
everyone, for coming.

01:27:06.648 --> 01:27:09.320
Merry Christmas
Eve and Merry Christmas.

01:27:09.453 --> 01:27:11.490
And thank you again, Mark.

01:27:11.625 --> 01:27:14.263
[Kenzie] Let's give it up for
Todd and Brooke Walkins!

01:27:14.463 --> 01:27:17.202
[people applauding]

01:27:17.671 --> 01:27:22.580
[upbeat Christmas
music continues]

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:39.647
Hey, come in.

01:27:40.716 --> 01:27:42.118
Hope you had a Merry
Christmas.

01:27:42.252 --> 01:27:43.722
I did. Thank you.

01:27:43.856 --> 01:27:45.626
Now, as you know,

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:47.262
we here at WKPC,

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:50.803
we value authenticity,
tenacity, spirit.

01:27:50.937 --> 01:27:52.406
Which is why

01:27:52.841 --> 01:27:54.410
Coffee with Kenzie

01:27:54.711 --> 01:27:57.415
will be WKPC's
new morning segment,

01:27:57.550 --> 01:28:00.421
which will alternate days
with Breakfast with Brooke.

01:28:00.856 --> 01:28:02.126
What?

01:28:02.192 --> 01:28:03.529
All the data supports
that adding you to the morning

01:28:03.662 --> 01:28:05.232
lineup will not only be good

01:28:05.365 --> 01:28:06.869
for Brooke,
but good for the station.

01:28:07.002 --> 01:28:09.974
You're trending
very high with the listeners.

01:28:10.275 --> 01:28:11.879
Are you serious?

01:28:12.146 --> 01:28:13.348
Yes, we are serious.

01:28:13.481 --> 01:28:15.653
And you know that
I've been trying to find

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:18.526
a balance
between work and family.

01:28:18.659 --> 01:28:20.495
And this is definitely

01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:22.333
a step in the right direction.

01:28:22.466 --> 01:28:25.974
And we both know
that you are going

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.345
to be an amazing addition

01:28:28.478 --> 01:28:30.249
to our on-air team.

01:28:30.415 --> 01:28:33.656
I second that,
and your show already

01:28:33.723 --> 01:28:36.595
has its first sponsor,
Topline papers.

01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:40.202
I think this has the potential
to be something really great.

01:28:40.468 --> 01:28:43.609
So what do you say, Kenzie?

01:28:43.976 --> 01:28:45.679
[uplifting music]

01:28:48.017 --> 01:28:50.355
[Kenzie] Oh, could you hold
the door, please?

01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:54.363
Thank you.

01:28:57.169 --> 01:28:58.404
Here. I got it.

01:28:58.539 --> 01:29:00.576
Thank you, again.

01:29:02.113 --> 01:29:04.483
No problem. Again.

01:29:05.653 --> 01:29:07.256
Good morning, Ann Arbor.

01:29:07.389 --> 01:29:09.460
I hope you had a very Merry
Christmas

01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:11.832
and
welcome to Coffee with Kenzie.

01:29:11.965 --> 01:29:14.571
It feel so crazy
to actually say that.

01:29:17.275 --> 01:29:18.679
Anywho, so

01:29:18.746 --> 01:29:20.348
my name is Kenzie Parker,
and you might know me

01:29:20.415 --> 01:29:22.453
[Kenzie] as the producer of
Breakfast with Brooke.

Shout out to Brooke Walkins

01:29:23.956 --> 01:29:25.559
for teaching me
everything I know.

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:26.995
To pay homage to Brooke,
I think we should start

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:29.032
the show
by taking some callers. Yeah?

01:29:30.235 --> 01:29:31.871
Okay, let's do this.

01:29:32.339 --> 01:29:33.408
Hi, caller.

01:29:33.576 --> 01:29:35.045
You're having Coffee
with Kenzie!

01:29:35.178 --> 01:29:36.615
[caller] Hi Kenzie, did
you have a Merry Christmas?

01:29:36.749 --> 01:29:38.284
I did have a Merry
Christmas. Did you?

01:29:38.719 --> 01:29:40.088
[Kenzie] Oh, that's great.

01:29:40.221 --> 01:29:42.092
That's, wait. You
do stockings twice?

01:29:42.426 --> 01:29:44.698
Stockings on Christmas
Eve and Christmas morning?

01:29:44.831 --> 01:29:46.802
That's epic!
I'm gonna steal that.

01:29:47.035 --> 01:29:48.806
No, I love it.
I think that's genius.

01:29:48.939 --> 01:29:51.277
Are there any other amazing
tips you should be giving me?

01:29:51.344 --> 01:29:57.055
