her jumping lessons,

00:03.627 --> 00:04.660

00:04.728 --> 00:06.261
- You, jumping.
- When do we start?

But you, you've been
at this for awhile, right?

02:14.649 --> 02:16.984
Do you ever get sick
of these routine visits?

02:17.052 --> 02:21.287
Scott: Well, most vets, they
live for the big surgery,

02:21.355 --> 02:23.489

take a look at this.

02:31.531 --> 02:33.199
What is it?

02:33.267 --> 02:36.401
Ty: Well, he's got a lot of
swelling in his joints here.

02:36.469 --> 02:37.502
See that?

02:39.239 --> 02:41.206
Come on.

02:42.675 --> 02:45.744
Whoa, you're right.
That's a lot of fluid.

Yeah.

02:59.158 --> 03:00.658
Yeah, it doesn't
look good.

03:00.725 --> 03:02.393
Ty:
Easy, easy, easy.

03:03.361 --> 03:04.695
What do you think?

03:05.463 --> 03:06.997
Well, I'm gonna have to do
some more tests,

03:07.064 --> 03:08.298
but with that much
swelling,

03:08.365 --> 03:10.767
it could be
pretty serious.

03:11.735 --> 03:12.836
<i>(Door click open)</i>
<i>Lisa: Hey there!</i>

03:12.904 --> 03:15.338
Come on in!
Just made a fresh pot.

03:15.406 --> 03:17.140
I have incredible news!

03:17.208 --> 03:18.708
Well,
let's hear it.

03:18.776 --> 03:20.543
That place
that we looked at in Toulon

03:20.611 --> 03:22.078
just went down
in price.

03:22.146 --> 03:24.513
Well...
Isn't that something.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.048
It won't stay on
the market for long,

03:26.116 --> 03:28.150
so we should make an offer
right away.

03:28.218 --> 03:30.085
Well, j-j-just back up
there, pardner.

03:30.153 --> 03:32.387
You dragged me through
a lot of places in France.

03:32.455 --> 03:33.755
Which one
are we talking about?

03:33.824 --> 03:35.390
The one - you know -
it had the vineyards

03:35.458 --> 03:37.793
and it had all the charming
little outbuildings.

03:37.861 --> 03:39.760
You told me that my villa
was too cramped for you

03:39.829 --> 03:41.662
and that this place
was perfect in size.

03:41.730 --> 03:43.631
Well, that might have been
a little bit o' talk -

03:43.699 --> 03:46.267
a little pie in the sky
there, but...

03:46.335 --> 03:49.204
You know, I don't have
that kind of money.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.404
But that's okay,
because...

03:50.472 --> 03:51.639
I'm going to sell
my place

03:51.707 --> 03:52.573
and that's gonna cover
most of it.

03:52.641 --> 03:53.908
Oh, Lisa...

03:53.976 --> 03:54.842
You said you had
a little bit of money

03:54.909 --> 03:56.443
that you wanted
to invest.

03:56.510 --> 03:57.744
<i>(Jack sighs)</i>

03:57.812 --> 03:59.646
I know it sounds like
a crazy dream,

03:59.714 --> 04:00.914
but it's... it's...

04:00.982 --> 04:03.650
A chance to make it
a reality.

04:03.718 --> 04:06.086
We had so much fun together
in France.

04:06.154 --> 04:08.222
I wanna get a vacation place
that's ours;

04:08.289 --> 04:10.724
That we both love
to go to.

04:10.791 --> 04:12.358
Come on,
what do you say?

04:12.425 --> 04:15.294
Let's do it!
(Chuckles awkwardly)

04:16.230 --> 04:17.762
Jeremy: Are you guys done
with Buckingham yet?

04:17.831 --> 04:19.365
I wanna get a schooling in
before the end of the day.

04:19.432 --> 04:21.067
(Sighs) Yeah,
we're done,

04:21.134 --> 04:23.069
but we noticed there's
some significant swelling

04:23.136 --> 04:24.470
in his joints.

04:24.537 --> 04:26.905
Thanks, but all I ordered
was a West Nile shot.

04:26.973 --> 04:28.106
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Well, I'm concerned enough</i>

04:28.174 --> 04:29.341
that I'd like to do
some more tests.

04:29.408 --> 04:30.775
Like I said,
there's some swelling

04:30.843 --> 04:32.210
and he might be in
some pain.

04:32.278 --> 04:34.145
Just give him some bute.

04:34.213 --> 04:35.613
<i>Scott:</i> <i>I don't think bute's
gonna</i> <i>cut it at this stage.</i>

04:35.681 --> 04:37.548
We need to look
at healing his joints

04:37.616 --> 04:39.851
with a more invasive
joint supplement.

04:39.919 --> 04:41.119
That sounds expensive.

04:41.187 --> 04:42.387
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>Well, it's not cheap,</i>

04:42.454 --> 04:44.488
but I'm worried that
if it goes untreated,

04:44.555 --> 04:45.756
in a few months

04:45.823 --> 04:49.026
it could lead to lameness
or...even worse.

04:49.094 --> 04:51.528
You know what? I'm good
with just the West Nile shot.

No, you're trying to scare me
into spending more money.

04:56.701 --> 04:58.235

right now!

my recommendation.

05:14.851 --> 05:18.120
Yeah. Some people
shouldn't own horses.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.655
He's gonna run Buckingham
into the ground.

05:20.723 --> 05:22.490
I know.

05:22.558 --> 05:24.659
Well, we gotta do something,
Scott.

05:24.727 --> 05:27.162
He refused treatment.

05:27.230 --> 05:29.798
So we're just gonna
ignore this?

05:29.865 --> 05:32.133
If an owner doesn't take
our advice,

05:32.200 --> 05:34.101
there's nothing
we can do about it.

09:24.985 --> 09:27.520
of those spoiled, rich,
horse owners.

09:27.587 --> 09:29.255
That's just the way
it is.

09:29.322 --> 09:32.057
So choose your battles
carefully, okay?

09:32.125 --> 09:33.559
Yeah, okay.

09:37.297 --> 09:39.731
Hey, girl.
How ya doing?

09:39.799 --> 09:43.201
She's way better.
I named her Remi.

09:43.269 --> 09:45.736
Hey, Remi!
Remember me?

09:45.804 --> 09:47.772
I don't think
she likes you.

09:47.839 --> 09:50.175
Of course she does.
I helped save her life.

09:50.242 --> 09:52.977
Here, Remi!
Come here, girl.

09:53.045 --> 09:54.945
Maybe you're just not
a dog person.

09:55.013 --> 09:58.014
(Laughs) For your
information, dogs love me.

09:58.082 --> 09:59.683
Remi doesn't.

09:59.750 --> 10:00.784
<i>Mallory:</i> <i>Of course she does!
</i> <i>Don't you, girl?</i>

10:00.851 --> 10:02.886
Come on, girl!
Come here!

10:02.953 --> 10:04.588
Obviously something's wrong
with her hearing.

10:04.656 --> 10:06.823
We should call Scott.

10:06.891 --> 10:09.259
Remi! (Whistles)
Come here! Let's go!

10:09.327 --> 10:11.728
See? There's nothing wrong
with your hearing!

10:11.796 --> 10:13.829
Mallory:
Well, that's gratitude for you.

10:13.897 --> 10:17.567
Next time you fall in a well,
you're on your own!

10:17.634 --> 10:19.134
(Hammer bangs)

10:19.203 --> 10:20.269
Hi!

10:22.172 --> 10:24.139
I'm here to help.
Where can I start?

10:24.208 --> 10:25.241
Are you sure you know

10:25.309 --> 10:26.409
what you're getting
yourself into?

10:26.476 --> 10:28.544
Fencing's a thankless job.

10:28.612 --> 10:30.412
I have mended many a fence
in my day.

10:30.479 --> 10:31.513
I can handle it.

10:31.581 --> 10:33.848
Now you didn't come here...

10:34.783 --> 10:37.085
Just to pressure me
into making a decision

10:37.152 --> 10:38.353
on that house in France?

10:38.421 --> 10:39.754
No, sir.

10:40.623 --> 10:42.390
I can respect that you need time
to think about it.

10:42.458 --> 10:44.892
I have no ulterior motives
but to help you.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.327
I brought my work gloves.

10:46.394 --> 10:48.829
(Laughs) All right then,
get those gloves on.

10:48.896 --> 10:49.930
Yes, boss.

10:51.633 --> 10:54.602
(Truck rumbles nearby
and comes to a stop)

11:04.111 --> 11:06.212
Can I talk to you
for a second?

11:06.280 --> 11:07.179
Jeremy:
I'm a little busy.

11:07.248 --> 11:08.514
No, it's important.

11:08.582 --> 11:09.549
Jeremy:
Be right back.

11:09.617 --> 11:11.117
Driver:
All right.

11:11.184 --> 11:13.319
Look, I know we got off
to a bad start today.

11:13.387 --> 11:15.288
Yeah, no kidding.

11:15.356 --> 11:16.889
I'm not trying to tell you
what to do.

11:16.957 --> 11:18.624
I just wanna help
your horse.

11:18.691 --> 11:20.292
Yeah, I'm real touched
that you care, bro,

11:20.360 --> 11:21.893
but I don't need
your help.

11:21.961 --> 11:23.328
Yes, you do.

11:23.396 --> 11:24.429
Okay, I know you've been
giving him bute,

11:24.497 --> 11:26.064
but that's a band-aid
solution.

11:26.132 --> 11:29.268
Oh! Is that your professional
vet opinion?

11:29.335 --> 11:30.602
Oh, wait a second,
I forgot.

11:30.670 --> 11:32.704
You're not a vet.
You're not even qualified

11:32.772 --> 11:34.238
to stick your hand
up a cow's butt.

11:34.306 --> 11:37.341
Okay, you're right,
I'm not a vet,

11:37.409 --> 11:38.576
and I don't expect you
to believe me,

11:38.644 --> 11:40.177
but you should believe
Dr. Cardinal.

11:40.245 --> 11:42.079
Well, Dr. Cardinal should
keep you on a shorter leash.

11:42.147 --> 11:43.147
If you wanna keep winning

11:43.214 --> 11:44.282
those pretty little
horse ribbons

11:44.349 --> 11:45.449
to impress your country club
friends,

11:45.517 --> 11:47.785
- you need to listen.
- No, you listen.

11:47.852 --> 11:49.186
One phone call

11:49.254 --> 11:50.720
and I can make every
show jumper, breeder,

11:50.788 --> 11:52.289
and polo player in Hudson

11:52.356 --> 11:55.725
drop Dr. Cardinal
from their roster.

11:55.793 --> 11:59.095
Do you want me
to make that call?

12:00.197 --> 12:02.332
I didn't think so.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.966
<i>Driver:</i>
<i>Jeremy!</i>

12:04.902 --> 12:06.802
You know,
it's been a real slice.

12:06.869 --> 12:09.070
I'll catch you later, bro.

12:15.790 --> 12:17.358
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Mm. Yeah.</i>

12:17.426 --> 12:19.660
I should've decked that guy
when I had the chance.

12:19.728 --> 12:21.395
Okay, what did you say
his name was?

12:21.462 --> 12:22.929
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Jeremy Hughes -</i>

12:22.997 --> 12:25.032
<i>just search under rich,</i>
<i>pompous, stuck-up jerk</i>

12:25.099 --> 12:26.033
and you'll find him.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.334
I got it.

12:27.402 --> 12:28.835
Okay, so...

12:28.903 --> 12:31.171
It looks like he was winning
a lot of shows back East,

12:31.239 --> 12:33.173
and then he came out to Hudson
a few months ago

12:33.241 --> 12:35.342
and now he's training
at Hillhurst Stables.

12:35.410 --> 12:37.609
Amy, he doesn't just
train there.

12:37.677 --> 12:40.012
According to his file,
Jeremy lives at Hillhurst.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.981
I thought Doug Saunders
and his wife owned that place.

12:43.050 --> 12:44.316
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Yeah, they do.</i>

12:44.384 --> 12:45.651
So he must be related,
or a family friend.

12:45.718 --> 12:48.487
Either way,
he's seriously loaded.

12:48.555 --> 12:51.190
Buckingham is a pretty
impressive-looking horse.

12:51.258 --> 12:52.857
Yeah, except he might not be
able to walk

12:52.925 --> 12:53.925
in a couple of months.

12:53.992 --> 12:56.294
I don't understand
why Jeremy would react that way

12:56.362 --> 12:58.129
to Scott's diagnosis.

12:58.197 --> 12:59.364
<i>Ty:</i> <i>It might have something
to do</i> <i>with the fact</i>

12:59.432 --> 13:01.399
that he's a rich, pompous,
stuck-up jerk.

13:01.467 --> 13:02.867
<i>Amy:</i> <i>I'm gonna go
out</i> <i>on a limb here,</i>

13:02.935 --> 13:04.602
but I'm starting to think
you really don't like this guy.

13:04.670 --> 13:06.304
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>He called me "bro."</i>

13:06.372 --> 13:08.172
Who's the smokin' hot
pony boy?

13:08.239 --> 13:09.606
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Look, Amy, I gotta go,</i>

13:09.674 --> 13:11.007
but we're still on for dinner
tonight, right?

13:11.076 --> 13:12.309
Um... yes,

13:12.377 --> 13:13.643
I'll meet you at the clinic
around seven.

13:13.711 --> 13:14.711
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Okay. Love you.</i>

13:14.779 --> 13:16.447
Love you, too.
Bye.

13:16.514 --> 13:19.550
Can't keep your eyes
off him, huh?

13:19.617 --> 13:20.917
I was looking
at the horse.

13:20.985 --> 13:22.018
Yeah, me too.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.623
Jack: Well, you're
a hell of a hand.

13:27.691 --> 13:29.592
Well, I'm impressed.

13:29.659 --> 13:31.360
Lisa:
You sound so surprised.

13:31.428 --> 13:34.097
Jack: Well, I've never seen
you twist barbed wire before.

13:34.164 --> 13:36.365
Lisa: Well, I couldn't always
afford ranch hands at Fairfield.

13:36.433 --> 13:38.601
I got my hands dirty
just like everybody else.

13:38.668 --> 13:39.902
I know.

13:39.970 --> 13:42.070
You worked hard at building up
your business.

13:42.138 --> 13:43.671
Yeah, you're darn right
I did.

13:43.739 --> 13:44.772
So did you!

13:46.309 --> 13:49.211
That's kinda why I wanna buy
this vacation house -

13:49.278 --> 13:50.512
<i>kick our feet up,</i>

13:50.580 --> 13:52.481
spend some time alone
together.

13:52.548 --> 13:55.016
We deserve some fun
now and again, don't we?

13:55.084 --> 13:56.183
Yeah, we do.
Yeah.

13:57.152 --> 13:58.986
And we had fun in France,
right?

13:59.053 --> 14:00.521
Jack: I thought you weren't
gonna bring up the house.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.123
Oh yeah.

14:02.190 --> 14:03.324
Just came out here
to work,

14:03.391 --> 14:04.725
not to talk your ear off...

14:04.792 --> 14:06.593
Starting right now.

14:07.561 --> 14:08.862
Do you want
another sandwich?

14:08.930 --> 14:12.298
<i>There's tuna,</i>
<i>half a roast chicken...</i>

14:13.835 --> 14:15.602
What?

14:15.670 --> 14:18.304
You're something else,
you know that?

14:18.372 --> 14:19.805
What does that mean?

14:19.873 --> 14:22.108
It means you're beautiful.

14:29.750 --> 14:30.816
(Chuckles)

14:32.953 --> 14:34.253
<i>Georgie:</i> <i>Where's your paw?
</i> <i>Give me your paw!</i>

14:34.320 --> 14:36.420
(Gasps) Is this your paw?
Yes, it is...

14:36.488 --> 14:39.524
Mallory: Katie won't
lay down for her nap.

14:39.591 --> 14:40.925
Well, did you try
reading to her?

14:40.993 --> 14:43.594
Of course I tried
reading to her.

14:43.663 --> 14:46.497
Well, maybe she wants me
and not you.

14:47.399 --> 14:48.599
Mallory: Where do you
think you're going?

14:48.668 --> 14:50.001
I'm going to read
to Katie.

14:50.069 --> 14:51.302
Since when do you read
to Katie?

14:51.370 --> 14:53.203
I don't know.
She likes "Charlotte's web."

14:53.271 --> 14:54.805
We've been reading it
together.

14:54.873 --> 14:56.406
I read that to her.

14:56.474 --> 15:00.343
Well, maybe I just do
the voices better.

15:03.815 --> 15:06.283
Hey, Remi!
Come here, Remi!

15:06.350 --> 15:07.684
Wanna go play fetch?

15:07.751 --> 15:09.285
Come on! Let's go!

15:11.855 --> 15:12.889
Fine!

15:14.925 --> 15:16.592
Amy: Hey, have you
seen Grandpa's keys?

15:16.660 --> 15:18.928
I... never mind,
I found them.

15:18.996 --> 15:20.329
Oh, and thanks for cleaning
the tack room!

15:20.397 --> 15:21.664
It looks absolutely amazing.

15:21.732 --> 15:23.232
Wasn't me.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.465
Hmm.
Must've been Georgie.

15:24.533 --> 15:26.101
Tell her I say
good job.

15:26.169 --> 15:28.536
(Sighs) Oh, another triumph
for Georgie.

15:28.604 --> 15:30.371
What can't that girl do?

15:30.439 --> 15:31.740
Excuse me?

15:31.808 --> 15:32.941
(Sighs) Nothing.

15:33.009 --> 15:34.876
It's just when I organize
the tack room,

15:34.944 --> 15:36.277
no one seems to notice.

15:36.345 --> 15:38.413
Not that I'm asking
for praise or anything,

15:38.480 --> 15:40.748
but a simple thank-you
every now and then

15:40.816 --> 15:42.083
would be nice.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.184
But I guess once you've been
here for awhile,

15:43.251 --> 15:44.685
people start to take you
for granted.

15:44.753 --> 15:46.187
Where is this
coming from?

15:46.254 --> 15:48.155
Ever since Georgie
has been here,

15:48.223 --> 15:49.724
I have been invisible.

15:49.791 --> 15:50.858
(Laughs) No.

15:50.926 --> 15:52.426
You have not been
invisible.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.361
Really? Because Katie
used to love it

15:54.429 --> 15:55.795
when I read her stories.

15:55.863 --> 15:57.463
Now she won't go to sleep
until Georgie reads to her.

15:57.531 --> 15:59.498
Even that stupid mutt
loves her more than me.

15:59.566 --> 16:01.067
And we all know
she's your star pupil.

16:01.135 --> 16:02.736
The way you go on
about her,

16:02.803 --> 16:05.739
it's like she's the next
Eric Lamaze.

16:05.806 --> 16:07.607
(Exhales)

16:07.674 --> 16:09.809
I'm gonna tell you this
because you're my friend

16:09.877 --> 16:11.544
and because I care
about you.

16:11.612 --> 16:12.644
(Keys clank)

16:15.414 --> 16:16.448
Grow up.

16:20.253 --> 16:21.754
You're fired!

16:21.821 --> 16:22.921
What did you say?

16:22.989 --> 16:24.489
You heard me.

16:24.557 --> 16:26.158
I'm gonna find a coach
that is worthy of my talents,

16:26.226 --> 16:28.860
and who doesn't think Georgie
is the be all end all

16:28.927 --> 16:30.527
of show jumping.

16:30.595 --> 16:32.764
You know, I have been more than
patient with you, Mallory,

16:32.831 --> 16:34.265
so if you think you can find
a better coach,

16:34.332 --> 16:35.566
be my guest.

16:35.634 --> 16:36.768
I will.

16:44.075 --> 16:46.109

Lisa: Hey, did I tell you

17:32.020 --> 17:34.421
live about five minutes
from that new house in Toulon.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.723
Uh!

17:36.791 --> 17:37.958
Not supposed to talk
about the house,

17:38.026 --> 17:39.726
sorry!

17:39.794 --> 17:42.362
Shutting up right now.

17:42.430 --> 17:43.997
It's just kind of exciting,
to me,

17:44.065 --> 17:45.598
to have friends
a little bit closer,

17:45.666 --> 17:47.534
and she told me
that they're planning

17:47.601 --> 17:49.735
a welcoming party
for us.

17:49.803 --> 17:52.671
Well... you know me,
I'm not much for parties.

I'm sorry,
but they are.

18:09.388 --> 18:10.655
When I met Frank,

18:10.723 --> 18:12.891
he talked for two hours
about his colonoscopy,

18:12.959 --> 18:15.026
and that was the high point
of our conversation.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.028
You never mentioned anything
about that in France.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.730
Jack: I didn't want
to ruin our vacation,

18:18.797 --> 18:20.130

18:21.799 --> 18:23.934
Well, what else did you keep
your mouth shut about

18:24.002 --> 18:25.369
in France?

18:25.436 --> 18:26.636
Oh boy...

18:27.772 --> 18:28.939
Well, what?

18:29.007 --> 18:31.575
I don't know,
a few things.

18:31.642 --> 18:33.543
Okay, well,
like what?

18:34.479 --> 18:36.012
Well, I don't think
I had a decent meal

18:36.080 --> 18:37.646
the entire time
we were there.

18:37.714 --> 18:39.615
What?!

18:39.683 --> 18:41.284
We ate at some
of the best restaurants

18:41.352 --> 18:42.886
in all of Europe.

18:42.953 --> 18:44.354
Well, it's pretty hard
to enjoy a meal

18:44.421 --> 18:46.455
when the waiter's looking down
his nose at you

18:46.523 --> 18:47.690
like you're some kind
of hick

18:47.758 --> 18:49.692
that's never seen
a salad fork before.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.960
Maybe it had something
to do with the fact

18:51.028 --> 18:52.928
that you're scrutinizing
the menu

18:52.996 --> 18:54.363
like a penny-pinching miser.

18:54.430 --> 18:55.730
I've always done that!

18:55.798 --> 18:57.665
You know you can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

18:57.733 --> 18:59.368
No, you can't.

18:59.435 --> 19:01.937
That dog's wearing
his cowboy hat all over France.

19:02.005 --> 19:03.505
I'm not gonna change
the way I dress

19:03.572 --> 19:05.240
just because I'm on a vacation.

19:05.308 --> 19:06.608
No! You won't change
anything!

19:06.675 --> 19:08.509
I mean, you...
You go to bed at nine,

19:08.576 --> 19:10.811
you wake up a five
like you got farm chores to do.

19:10.879 --> 19:12.880
That is my routine.

19:12.948 --> 19:14.348
I can't believe
you lied!

19:14.416 --> 19:15.349
I didn't lie.

19:15.417 --> 19:16.350
Well, you did though.

19:16.418 --> 19:17.618
I just kept
my mouth shut.

19:17.685 --> 19:19.620
Well, that is exactly
the same thing.

19:19.687 --> 19:21.022
I went on the trip,
Lise!

19:21.089 --> 19:24.124
What else do you want
from me?

19:26.727 --> 19:28.094
(Stunned exhale)

19:38.005 --> 19:39.306
(Sighs heavily)

19:41.874 --> 19:46.745
(Water runs, horse neighs,
low hum of chatter in stable)

19:46.813 --> 19:50.349
Jeremy: You did so good
out there today, Buck.

19:50.417 --> 19:51.716
That's my boy.
Excuse me?

19:51.784 --> 19:54.219
Sorry, I don't mean
to interrupt.

19:54.287 --> 19:55.154
I was watching you
practice.

19:55.221 --> 19:57.388
- It's incredible.
- Thanks.

19:57.456 --> 19:59.023
Well, Buckingham deserves
all the credit.

19:59.091 --> 20:00.858
He's doing all the hard work.

20:00.926 --> 20:01.960
Isn't that right, Buck?

20:02.027 --> 20:03.461
Amy:
Hey, you.

20:03.528 --> 20:05.796
Hey. Hello...

20:05.864 --> 20:07.065
He likes you.

20:07.132 --> 20:08.266
(Laughs)

20:08.334 --> 20:09.867
Buck's very particular,
so that's a...

20:09.935 --> 20:10.634
That's a pretty
big compliment.

20:10.702 --> 20:11.735
Amy:
Oh.

20:12.770 --> 20:14.104
I'm sorry,

20:14.172 --> 20:15.872
I totally didn't
introduce myself.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.274
<i>Jeremy:</i>
<i>You're Amy Fleming.</i>

20:17.342 --> 20:19.242
I know who you are.

20:19.310 --> 20:21.011
I've seen you
in the newspaper.

20:21.079 --> 20:23.813
You're like the Hudson Times
cover girl.

20:23.881 --> 20:26.883
Yeah, well, not a whole lot
happens in Hudson, so...

20:26.951 --> 20:28.317
Oh, I'm Jeremy.

20:28.385 --> 20:30.819
Hi. Nice to meet you.

20:30.887 --> 20:33.022
So I just, um,
I came to put up one of these.

20:33.090 --> 20:35.157
I work with horses
at Heartland.

20:35.225 --> 20:36.459
I know.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.527
Oh, that was in the paper too.

20:38.595 --> 20:40.463
Of course.

20:40.530 --> 20:44.232
Um... okay, well, if you ever
wanna stop by Heartland,

20:44.300 --> 20:45.933
um, I am available.

20:47.936 --> 20:49.637
To look at your horse -

20:49.705 --> 20:51.906
not that he needs-
I mean, he's amazing.

20:51.974 --> 20:53.541
I just thought,
if something changes,

20:53.609 --> 20:55.176
or if you know someone...

20:55.244 --> 20:57.312
Do you want me
to put that up for you?

20:57.380 --> 20:58.813
Sure. Okay.

21:00.048 --> 21:01.715
That'd be great.

21:01.782 --> 21:04.218
Um, I should get going
anyway.

21:04.285 --> 21:05.519
Okay.

21:05.586 --> 21:08.355
I'll see you around,
Amy Fleming.

21:09.690 --> 21:10.790
Yes you will.

21:19.933 --> 21:22.201
<i>Amy:</i> <i>So I went by
Hillhurst Stables</i> <i>today.</i>

21:22.269 --> 21:23.936
Really? Why?

21:24.004 --> 21:25.571
Well, you were talking
about that Jeremy guy

21:25.639 --> 21:28.141
and wanted to go see
what was going on.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.143
You're wasting time,
Amy.

21:30.210 --> 21:31.710
I saw him jumping.

21:31.778 --> 21:34.446
He's absolutely
amazing.

21:34.514 --> 21:35.680
How was Buckingham?

21:35.748 --> 21:37.049
He's great!

21:37.116 --> 21:38.216
I mean,
if he's going lame,

21:38.284 --> 21:39.617
you definitely
couldn't tell.

21:39.685 --> 21:40.718
That's probably because
Jeremy's loading him with bute,

21:40.786 --> 21:42.654
which is only gonna make
things worse.

21:42.721 --> 21:44.889
That's why
I wanna go back.

21:44.957 --> 21:46.525
I think I can talk
some sense into him.

21:46.592 --> 21:48.192
Jeremy seemed
really nice.

21:48.260 --> 21:50.794
Amy, he's not, okay?
He's a jerk.

21:50.862 --> 21:51.929
And I'd rather you not
get mixed up in this

21:51.996 --> 21:53.064
'cause if you get involved,

21:53.131 --> 21:54.131
then I'm gonna have
to get involved,

21:54.199 --> 21:55.232
and I really don't like
the guy.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.467
I know you don't,

21:56.535 --> 21:58.602
but he didn't seem
all that bad to me.

21:58.670 --> 22:00.837
Right. First he refuses
to treat his horse,

22:00.905 --> 22:02.573
then he threatens
to fire Scott

22:02.640 --> 22:04.240
and get his rich friends
to do the same.

22:04.308 --> 22:05.508
What's not to like?

22:05.576 --> 22:07.610
(Amy's cell phone rings)

22:09.146 --> 22:10.780
Amy:
Hello?

22:10.847 --> 22:12.615
Jeremy: Hey.
I got your number from your postcard.

22:12.683 --> 22:13.983
<i>It's Jeremy.</i>

22:14.051 --> 22:15.518
Amy:
Hey!

22:15.586 --> 22:16.786
Jeremy: I thought if
you're not busy tomorrow,

22:16.853 --> 22:17.954
you should trailer
your horse over and...

22:18.021 --> 22:19.489
We'll do some jumping.

22:19.557 --> 22:21.390
Um, tomorrow...
I don't know.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.592
<i>Jeremy:</i> <i>Oh, come on,</i>
<i>it'll be a blast.</i>

22:23.659 --> 22:25.561
It's just I've got lots
to do tomorrow,

22:25.628 --> 22:26.928
tons of work.

22:26.996 --> 22:28.430
<i>Jeremy:</i>
<i>Well, this is work.</i>

22:28.498 --> 22:31.833
I mean, Buck's been a little
less energetic than usual.

22:31.901 --> 22:33.235
I thought maybe
while you're here

22:33.303 --> 22:35.337
you could...
You could take a look at him,

22:35.405 --> 22:39.006
and I'd really value
your professional opinion.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.410
Okay. How 'bout I come by
tomorrow morning.

22:42.478 --> 22:44.545
Great.
I'll see you tomorrow.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.813
Okay.

22:47.149 --> 22:48.483
All right, all done.
You ready to go?

22:48.550 --> 22:49.750
Uh, yup!

23:03.401 --> 23:05.101
Amy:
What're you still doing up?

23:05.168 --> 23:07.303
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

23:08.305 --> 23:09.872
The house in France?

23:09.940 --> 23:11.007
(Sighs) Yeah...

23:13.043 --> 23:15.011
Did you talk
to Lisa?

23:15.079 --> 23:16.946
Well, I started
to talk to Lisa

23:17.014 --> 23:19.448
but we just ended up fightin'.

23:19.516 --> 23:20.782
I'm sorry.

23:20.850 --> 23:22.483
Well, it's my own doing.

23:23.385 --> 23:27.355
I should've been more honest
with her in the first place.

23:27.423 --> 23:30.025
Boy, keeping secrets
from the people we love...

23:30.093 --> 23:33.195
That never ends well.
(Chuckles wryly)

23:34.163 --> 23:37.264
You're right.
You are so right.

23:38.466 --> 23:39.433
Thanks.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.701
Good night!

23:41.402 --> 23:43.070
(Laughs)
Good night.

23:49.778 --> 23:51.678

23:52.280 --> 23:54.981
<i>Jeremy:</i> <i>You've reached Jeremy.
</i> <i>Why aren't you texting me?</i>

23:55.049 --> 23:57.217
<i>Guess you're old school,</i>
<i>so leave a message.</i>

23:57.284 --> 23:59.352
Hi, Jeremy,
it's Amy calling.

23:59.419 --> 24:01.054
Um, I'm just gonna have
to cancel tomorrow.

24:01.122 --> 24:04.457
I'm really sorry,
but something came up.

24:08.828 --> 24:10.462
(Birds chirp)

24:18.037 --> 24:19.337
Georgie:
Oh no...

24:20.106 --> 24:22.507
I forgot to close the gate
last night.

24:22.575 --> 24:26.210
The horses are gone!
Amy's going to kill me.

24:28.513 --> 24:30.148
Come on, Remi!
Let's go!

24:30.215 --> 24:31.215
(Remi barks)

24:37.422 --> 24:41.691
(Horse grunts as it gallops,
Amy clucks her tongue)

24:44.428 --> 24:46.462
(Vehicle rumbles nearby)

24:54.939 --> 24:56.506
Jeremy:
I got your message.

24:56.573 --> 24:58.941
What are you doing here?

24:59.009 --> 25:00.342
Jeremy:
Well, I thought,

25:00.410 --> 25:01.143
since you couldn't make it out
to Hillhurst,

25:01.211 --> 25:03.345
I'd come here instead.

25:03.413 --> 25:04.847
Okay. Well, if you just wanna
leave your horse here,

25:04.915 --> 25:06.515
I can have a look at him
later.

25:06.582 --> 25:08.317
Why would I leave him
here?

25:08.384 --> 25:11.586
Well, you were concerned
about his energy level.

25:11.654 --> 25:14.656
Oh, right.
Yeah, he's fine now.

25:14.724 --> 25:16.658
I just wanted to do
some jumping.

25:16.726 --> 25:19.127
Oh, okay.
Well, Jeremy, I can't.

25:19.195 --> 25:21.930
You can't jump?
Or you can't jump with me?

25:21.997 --> 25:23.532
<i>Or both?</i>

25:23.599 --> 25:26.067
(Sighs) I'm just totally
booked up today.

25:26.135 --> 25:29.304
Just twenty minutes,
that's all I'm asking.

25:30.272 --> 25:31.639
What do you say?

25:38.780 --> 25:40.281
Lisa:
Hello!

25:40.349 --> 25:41.382
Hi.

25:42.718 --> 25:46.320
Lise, I'm so glad
you're here.

25:46.387 --> 25:49.022
I really didn't like
how we left yesterday.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.590
No. I didn't either.

25:50.658 --> 25:51.959
Look, um...

25:52.660 --> 25:54.294
If I'd known
what a lousy time

25:54.362 --> 25:55.495
you were having
in France-

25:55.563 --> 25:58.165
it wasn't a lousy time.
I was with you.

25:58.233 --> 26:00.234
Can't-
just let me finish.

26:00.301 --> 26:02.335
If you had been honest
with me,

26:02.402 --> 26:03.635
then I would never
have suggested

26:03.703 --> 26:06.239
that we buy property there
together.

26:06.306 --> 26:08.807
But since you pretended
to have a good time

26:08.876 --> 26:10.343
the entire time
we were there...

26:10.410 --> 26:12.345
I just didn't wanna
to disappoint you.

26:12.412 --> 26:14.280
I... I'm sorry.

26:14.348 --> 26:16.082
But...

26:16.149 --> 26:18.383
Jack, I was thinking about
this vacation property,

26:18.450 --> 26:20.919
for us,
as the next step,

26:21.854 --> 26:24.956
but since
I'm so obviously wrong,

26:25.892 --> 26:29.227
it just sorta
makes me wonder...

26:29.295 --> 26:31.662
Where do we go
from here?

26:33.565 --> 26:35.232
I don't know
what that means.

26:35.300 --> 26:37.067
Well...

26:37.135 --> 26:38.969
We've been down
the marriage road

26:39.037 --> 26:42.006
and I know that that's
not in the cards for us,

26:42.073 --> 26:43.607
and clearly this
vacation property

26:43.674 --> 26:45.809
is not in the cards
for us either.

26:45.877 --> 26:48.812
So I have to ask you again,

26:48.880 --> 26:51.514
where do we go
from here?

26:53.583 --> 26:56.219
I'm not sure
I have an answer.

26:57.187 --> 26:58.754
I know...

26:59.723 --> 27:03.393
And I need an answer
for that, so...

27:03.460 --> 27:06.828
I think you should
think about it.

27:07.830 --> 27:10.265
I'll talk to you later.

27:13.069 --> 27:14.769
Okay.

27:16.940 --> 27:17.973
(Sighs heavily)

27:19.342 --> 27:20.775
(Vehicle rumbles)

27:29.084 --> 27:31.252
That horse doesn't look
like much of a jumper.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.853
Oh, he'll give Buckingham
a run for his money,

27:32.921 --> 27:34.588
don't you worry.

27:34.656 --> 27:37.024
Oh, them's fightin' words,
huh?

27:37.092 --> 27:38.858
And to think I was gonna
go easy on you.

27:38.926 --> 27:40.726
Don't bother.

27:40.794 --> 27:42.329
I may be a little
out of practice,

27:42.396 --> 27:44.130
but I've beat way better
jumpers than you.

27:44.198 --> 27:46.499
Oh, really?!

29:15.983 --> 29:17.418
What's wrong?

29:18.386 --> 29:20.354
I left the back gate open
last night.

29:20.422 --> 29:23.090
The horses are gone.
I can't find them anywhere.

29:23.158 --> 29:24.324
Georgie...

29:25.493 --> 29:27.461
I know,
I messed up again.

29:28.396 --> 29:31.464
Jack's gonna get rid of me
for sure.

29:32.866 --> 29:34.534
Mallory:
Stay there.

29:34.601 --> 29:37.503
Make sure you look after Katie
when she wakes up from her nap.

29:37.571 --> 29:39.805
Are you gonna tell Jack?

29:39.873 --> 29:41.240
Just stay there.

29:46.946 --> 29:48.580
Are you sure
about this?

29:48.647 --> 29:50.048
Jeremy:
It's a piece of cake.

29:50.116 --> 29:51.749
(Clucks his tongue)

29:56.989 --> 30:00.592
(Buckingham grunts nervously)
Come on!

30:00.659 --> 30:02.460
Amy: Do you want
me to put it down?

30:02.527 --> 30:03.561
No, he can do it.

30:06.431 --> 30:08.332
(Buckingham grunts nervously)

30:08.400 --> 30:09.966
Jeremy:
Ungh! Oh...

30:10.033 --> 30:11.101
Amy:
Jeremy?!

30:12.303 --> 30:14.003
Are you okay?

30:14.071 --> 30:17.039
(Groans) Yeah...

30:17.108 --> 30:19.709
I don't know
what just happened.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.144
Amy:
Whoa... easy...

30:23.280 --> 30:24.347
Hey, boy...

30:27.117 --> 30:29.784
His joints are really swollen.

30:29.852 --> 30:31.553
No, he's fine.

30:33.689 --> 30:35.524
No. I think he's in
a lot of pain;

30:35.592 --> 30:37.792
That's probably why
he's acting like this.

30:37.860 --> 30:39.595
No.
He just needs rest.

30:39.662 --> 30:40.929
This isn't the first time

30:40.997 --> 30:42.363
something like this
has happened, is it?

30:42.431 --> 30:43.564
Well... I've been
training him hard.

30:43.632 --> 30:45.266
It's normal for
high-performance horses

30:45.334 --> 30:48.236
to have some joint pain.

30:48.303 --> 30:51.472
He needs treatment.
You can't keep ignoring this.

30:51.540 --> 30:53.474
Who said
I've been ignoring it?

30:53.542 --> 30:55.075
(Truck rumbles up)

30:57.745 --> 30:59.112
Friend of yours?

30:59.180 --> 31:00.280
My boyfriend.

31:01.616 --> 31:03.283
Is he the one
who put you up to this?

31:03.351 --> 31:05.318
You came to me,
remember?

31:05.386 --> 31:06.986
Well, you could've
said something.

31:07.054 --> 31:08.488
Amy: I knew if I said
something about Ty,

31:08.523 --> 31:10.323
you wouldn't let me
near your horse.

31:10.391 --> 31:13.659
So this is all
about Buckingham?

31:13.726 --> 31:16.295
Ty:
Hey! What're you doing here?

31:17.230 --> 31:20.466
Don't worry,
I was just leaving.

31:26.313 --> 31:28.580
<i>(Jeremy clucks his tongue)</i>

31:28.648 --> 31:29.681
So he just trailered
his horse here

31:29.749 --> 31:31.149
outta the blue?

31:31.217 --> 31:32.651
Well, he invited me
to practice with him

31:32.719 --> 31:34.085
at Hillhurst,

31:34.153 --> 31:37.556
and, at first, I accepted,
and then I changed my mind.

31:37.624 --> 31:38.624
Let me guess,

31:38.691 --> 31:40.158
he didn't take no
for an answer.

31:40.226 --> 31:42.494
Well, at least, now I know
what's wrong with his horse.

31:42.562 --> 31:43.729
You were right;
He does need treatment.

31:43.797 --> 31:45.396
I don't care, Amy.

31:45.464 --> 31:47.097
Jeremy has got too much time
and money on his hands.

31:47.165 --> 31:48.999
Guys like that think they can
take whatever they want

31:49.067 --> 31:50.401
and do whatever they want -

31:50.469 --> 31:51.569
and that includes taking
other guy's girlfriends.

31:51.637 --> 31:52.870
- Ty-
- Hey, Jeremy!

31:53.605 --> 31:55.039
<i>I want you to stay away</i>
<i>from girlfriend</i>

31:55.106 --> 31:57.041
and this property,
all right?!

31:58.310 --> 32:01.311
Hey! Who's being
a jerk now, huh?

32:02.947 --> 32:04.548
Amy, he's got more
than enough money

32:04.615 --> 32:06.149
to help that horse,
so why doesn't he?

32:06.216 --> 32:07.584
Well, I don't know, Ty,

32:07.652 --> 32:08.618
but I don't think
it's as simple

32:08.686 --> 32:09.619
as you're making it
out to be.

32:09.687 --> 32:11.054
Ty:
Well, I do.

32:11.121 --> 32:12.121
(Amy sighs)

32:14.725 --> 32:15.759
(Truck door bangs shut)

32:29.873 --> 32:32.640
Georgie, I just saved
your butt big time.

32:32.708 --> 32:34.709
Take care of Katie,
I'll be right back -

32:34.777 --> 32:36.177
and make me a BLT.

32:37.145 --> 32:38.580
(Phone beeps off)

32:39.615 --> 32:40.648
Come on.

32:56.464 --> 32:57.531
Yes?

32:57.599 --> 32:58.632
Hi. Is Jeremy home?

32:58.700 --> 32:59.700
Jeremy?

32:59.767 --> 33:00.968
Jeremy Hughes.

33:01.035 --> 33:02.235
He's staying with
Mr. and Mrs. Saunders.

33:02.303 --> 33:03.937
No, I'm sorry,
you must be mistaken.

33:04.005 --> 33:06.172
There's no one here
by that name.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.108
Okay. Thank you.

33:11.678 --> 33:13.480
(Horses whinny nearby)

33:14.448 --> 33:16.116
(Low hum of chatter)

33:24.357 --> 33:26.925
(Riders murmur to one another)

33:28.495 --> 33:31.130
<i>(Jeremy's truck starts up)</i>

33:31.197 --> 33:32.498
(Engine rumbles)

33:49.581 --> 33:51.182
Amy:
Hey!

33:51.250 --> 33:52.983
Jeremy: You just don't
know when to quit, do you?

33:53.051 --> 33:54.918
Look, I'm sorry.

33:55.986 --> 33:57.787
I should've told you
about Ty.

33:57.855 --> 33:58.755
You came all the way
out here

33:58.822 --> 34:00.957
just to tell me that?

34:01.025 --> 34:02.959
I went up to the house
at Hillhurst

34:03.027 --> 34:04.327
and you don't live there.

34:04.395 --> 34:05.762
I never said I did.

34:05.829 --> 34:07.130
Well,
where do you live?

34:07.198 --> 34:08.864
The Trump Tower.

34:08.933 --> 34:10.966
Why do you care?

34:11.034 --> 34:12.268
(Sighs)

34:13.170 --> 34:14.770
You know, back when
I was show jumping,

34:14.837 --> 34:16.072
it didn't take me long
to realize

34:16.139 --> 34:18.239
that's it's an exclusive club.

34:18.308 --> 34:20.509
<i>Sometimes it feels like</i>
<i>if you don't have a trust fund,</i>

34:20.577 --> 34:22.411
<i>then you don't belong.</i>

34:22.478 --> 34:23.745
So if I was living in
my trailer,

34:23.813 --> 34:25.413
I probably wouldn't
tell anyone either.

34:25.481 --> 34:29.050
(Laughs) I don't live
in my trailer.

34:29.118 --> 34:30.784
Then why are you
carrying groceries there?

34:32.754 --> 34:35.389
All right, back off,
Nancy Drew.

34:36.792 --> 34:39.094
I know you care
about Buckingham, all right?

34:39.161 --> 34:42.196
I've seen you two together,
you have a connection;

34:42.263 --> 34:45.931
That's why I know
you can tell he's hurting.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.502
There's nothing I care
more about than Buck.

34:48.570 --> 34:49.636
I know.

34:51.973 --> 34:54.373
But I can't afford
those drugs.

34:54.442 --> 34:56.409
I can barely afford
cereal.

34:56.478 --> 34:58.744
Why don't you
let me help you?

34:58.812 --> 35:00.546
I don't need your help.

35:00.614 --> 35:01.680
'Cause after I win
the prize money

35:01.748 --> 35:03.048
<i>at the Winter Classic,</i>

35:03.117 --> 35:04.250
<i>i'll buy Buck</i>
<i>whatever he needs.</i>

35:04.318 --> 35:07.353
By then,
it might be too late.

35:11.425 --> 35:13.592
That's only three!
Where's the other one?

35:13.659 --> 35:15.093
Mallory:
What other one?

35:15.161 --> 35:16.661
Georgie:
Oh no!

35:16.729 --> 35:19.164
Amy's gonna tell Jack,
Jack's gonna tell Clint,

35:19.232 --> 35:21.600
then Clint's gonna send me
back to that stupid foster home

35:21.667 --> 35:22.867
that smells like cat pee.

35:22.935 --> 35:25.337
Okay, calm down.
We'll find the other one.

35:25.404 --> 35:26.238
Who's watching Katie?

35:26.305 --> 35:27.872
I left her with Jack.

35:27.940 --> 35:29.640
Go saddle up.
Hurry!

35:33.945 --> 35:35.446
Amy: Jeremy can't afford
to treat his horse,

35:35.514 --> 35:38.415
he's just too proud
to admit it.

35:38.483 --> 35:40.384
Ty: And I'm supposed
to feel bad for him?

35:40.452 --> 35:44.087
Amy: No. No, not after
the way he treated you.

35:44.156 --> 35:46.489
I sorta understand
what he's going through though.

35:46.557 --> 35:48.358
I mean, show jumping
iis expensive,

35:48.425 --> 35:51.327
and people in that world
can be... snobs.

35:51.395 --> 35:53.195
I think he's just trying
to protect himself.

35:53.263 --> 35:55.397
Okay, well, he could've
asked me for help, Amy.

35:55.465 --> 35:57.667
Instead,
he was hitting on you.

35:57.734 --> 35:59.234
You don't think there's
anything going on between us,

35:59.302 --> 36:00.770
do you?

36:00.837 --> 36:03.906
No, of course not.
I trust you.

36:04.841 --> 36:06.508
And I'm sorry
I lost it earlier,

36:06.576 --> 36:08.077
I just...

36:08.145 --> 36:09.811
That guy pushes
my buttons.

36:09.879 --> 36:11.546
I know.

36:11.613 --> 36:15.383
But...I do think he's trying
to help his horse,

36:15.450 --> 36:16.284
and I'd like to see
what I can do

36:16.351 --> 36:18.352
for Buckingham, too.

36:18.420 --> 36:19.353
Why do you always
have to see

36:19.421 --> 36:20.889
the best in people?

36:20.956 --> 36:22.223
Why can't you
just be judgmental

36:22.291 --> 36:24.125
like the rest of us?

36:24.193 --> 36:26.493
I saw the best in you,
didn't I?

36:26.561 --> 36:28.628
I wasn't pretending to be
something I wasn't.

36:28.697 --> 36:31.165
Scott:
Ty! Let's get a move on!

36:31.232 --> 36:34.334
Yeah, okay,
I'll be right there!

36:35.970 --> 36:37.171
(Sighs) You wanna work
with that horse,

36:37.238 --> 36:38.572
that's fine.

36:38.639 --> 36:40.540
I will do whatever
you need.

36:40.608 --> 36:42.175
But I still don't trust
that guy,

36:42.242 --> 36:44.877
so please be careful,
okay?

36:44.945 --> 36:46.012
Mm-hmm.

36:47.014 --> 36:48.748
- See you.
- See you.

36:50.550 --> 36:51.884
(Sighs heavily)

36:58.725 --> 37:00.058
Jack: Hi.
Lisa: Hi.

37:01.060 --> 37:02.928
Jack:
Good to see you.

37:03.896 --> 37:05.396
Have a seat right here,

37:05.464 --> 37:08.700
'cause I have something
I wanna show you.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.970
Now what do you think
of this right here?

37:12.904 --> 37:15.405
Now that's a place
in Arizona.

37:15.473 --> 37:17.441
It's got a few acres of land
attached to it,

37:17.508 --> 37:20.044
and I thought...

37:20.112 --> 37:22.479
Well, maybe we could buy it,
together,

37:22.547 --> 37:25.850
as a kind of a...
You know, a compromise.

37:29.186 --> 37:32.088
Lisa, I wanna have
a future with you

37:32.156 --> 37:34.991
and Arizona's close
to both our lives

37:35.059 --> 37:36.692
and uh... you know,

37:36.761 --> 37:38.228
we could spend some months
in the winter there,

37:38.295 --> 37:39.362
every year.

37:40.397 --> 37:41.597
Maybe this...

37:41.665 --> 37:44.634
Maybe this is
the next step for us.

37:48.905 --> 37:53.742
I already bought the place
that you liked in France.

37:57.981 --> 38:01.615
By the time I found out
how uninterested you were,

38:01.683 --> 38:03.251
my real estate agent
had already found a buyer

38:03.318 --> 38:04.618
for my house.

38:05.620 --> 38:06.654
I see...

38:10.325 --> 38:11.759
Don't worry, you don't have
to come visit me.

38:11.827 --> 38:13.460
Now, wait a minute.
What about us?

38:13.528 --> 38:16.197
Where does that leave us?

38:19.500 --> 38:24.037
As usual...
miles apart.

38:26.874 --> 38:29.609
You're here...
and I'm there.

38:36.149 --> 38:40.019
We should take a break,
don't you think?

38:51.020 --> 38:54.455
<i>(Truck engine shuts off,</i>
<i>door bangs shut)</i>

38:56.057 --> 38:57.824
What is it with you
and your girlfriend?

38:57.892 --> 38:58.825
How many times
do I have to say,

38:58.893 --> 39:00.527
"leave me alone"?

39:00.595 --> 39:01.895
Ty: Believe me, there is
nothing I would rather do.

39:01.963 --> 39:03.229
Actually,
that's not true.

39:03.297 --> 39:04.431
I'd rather knock that smug look
off your face,

39:04.498 --> 39:06.399
but Amy would kill me.

39:07.501 --> 39:08.969
Okay.
So why are you here?

39:09.037 --> 39:10.503
Amy's not gonna stop
until she can help your horse,

39:10.571 --> 39:12.371
so I suggest you let her.

39:12.439 --> 39:15.641
I still don't get
how that involves you?

39:15.709 --> 39:17.577
I have the supplement
Scott prescribed.

39:17.644 --> 39:19.845
That stuff costs
a fortune.

39:19.913 --> 39:21.080
Well, we got lots of free
samples at the clinic,

39:21.147 --> 39:22.548
so don't worry about it.

39:22.616 --> 39:24.050
I don't want your charity, man.

39:24.117 --> 39:26.418
Let me be very clear
with you, Jeremy.

39:26.486 --> 39:27.518
I'm not doing this
for you,

39:27.587 --> 39:29.353
I'm doing it
for your horse.

39:29.421 --> 39:31.823
<i>(Horse whinnies nearby)</i>

39:33.459 --> 39:36.995
Well, I'll pay you back
when I win my next horse show.

39:37.063 --> 39:38.797
Fine.

39:38.864 --> 39:40.999
This is
a four-month supply.

39:41.067 --> 39:44.735
I'll show you
how to do the injection.

39:51.876 --> 39:53.744
The horse is gone!
It disappeared.

39:53.812 --> 39:54.745
What're we gonna do?

39:54.813 --> 39:55.913
Keep searching.

39:55.981 --> 39:57.681
He's gotta be around here
somewhere.

39:59.149 --> 40:01.884
Did you two lose
something?

40:01.952 --> 40:03.920
I found him grazing
in the neighbour's field.

40:03.988 --> 40:05.187

left the gate open.

It's all right.

I shouldn't have
fired you.

You were right.

41:51.888 --> 41:52.955
We can go back
to being friends

41:53.023 --> 41:55.791
and you can go back
to being my coach?
