00:06.774 --> 00:08.407
Sir, listen to me, sir.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.142
I can only help you if you
listen to me

00:10.144 --> 00:11.410
and you answer my questions.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.745
Okay, let's go.
We got nine calls in queue.

00:12.747 --> 00:15.047
We're backed up. Dispatch,
can you move your calls?

00:15.049 --> 00:17.082
Car 1353,
you are first responder.

00:17.084 --> 00:18.684
Car 41,
what is your 20?

00:18.686 --> 00:20.519
Okay, we got three cars in 13
on a 10-50.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.421
Pull 'em off.  Move 'em in.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.590
Hey, you know what time it is?
Yeah, I know what time it is.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.625
Got an excuse?
Nothing good.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.027
We're short today.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.361
1,800 calls already?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.463
Something's in the air.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.801
911, what is your emergency?

00:41.075 --> 00:42.808
GIRL:
What do you see?

00:45.312 --> 00:46.645
No, Maurice.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.647
Cirrus is the feathery ones.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.583
Like we saw on the prairies.

00:51.585 --> 00:56.388
You know what
they're made out of?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.689
Nope.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.392
Ice crystals.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.728
'Cause of how high up they are.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.766
Fooled ya.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.154
Yeah, I got it.
I'll pass it on.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.724
Hi.
Can I help you?

01:32.726 --> 01:34.393
Uh, yeah.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.627
I'm here to see
Greg Parker.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.363
Sure. Can I tell him
who it is?

01:38.365 --> 01:40.599
Yeah, um, Dean Parker.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.603
Hey.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.637
Hey.

01:45.639 --> 01:46.805
Uh...
Hey.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.474
Uh, hey.

01:48.476 --> 01:51.610
What are you doing here?
I mean, it's good to...

01:51.612 --> 01:53.278
I just didn't know
you were coming.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.181
I, um... It's good to...
it's good to see you.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.217
Yeah, uh...

02:00.588 --> 02:02.654
(breathing heavily)

02:08.829 --> 02:11.196
Hey!

02:16.737 --> 02:20.339
Yeah, we're, we're just up
visiting Shelby...

02:21.308 --> 02:22.708
Uh, my aunt.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.210
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no,
I know who Shelby is. I know.

02:25.212 --> 02:27.746
Why didn't you tell me?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.648
I-I didn't want
to call first. I...

02:29.650 --> 02:31.750
I thought I might back out.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.153
Does your mom know you're here?

02:34.155 --> 02:36.588
No. She, she thinks
I'm at a movie.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.458
She doesn't know you're here?

02:39.460 --> 02:42.461
Do you think there's someplace
we can go and talk?

02:42.463 --> 02:45.631
Yeah... yeah.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.901
Come on. Come on.

02:53.674 --> 02:57.242
What do you see out there, Mo?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.411
Really?

02:59.413 --> 03:02.648
What color?

03:02.650 --> 03:04.783
Cool. I like crocuses.

03:04.785 --> 03:08.754
I like how they mean, "Don't
worry; spring's almost here."

03:08.756 --> 03:11.290
(gate rattles)

03:11.959 --> 03:13.859
(gasps)

03:13.861 --> 03:16.528
Kate, I got a call for you
on the 22 line.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.529
It's your friend.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.981
I can't take it.

03:18.982 --> 03:20.432
I'm sorry, sir, I'm having
trouble hearing you.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.901
EMS.
I've got a possible cardiac,
Wayne's Tavern,

03:22.903 --> 03:25.704
2087 Adelaide Street.
Check the front and the rear.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.806
Van 18, I have you
King and Dufferin.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.509
Sir, did you say that
you're bleeding?

03:30.511 --> 03:32.711
14 Division, I got a stabbing.
EMS, cancel the cardiac.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.745
I've got a bleeder.
Possible stabbing.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.714
2087 Adelaide. You got a name?

03:35.716 --> 03:36.882
Sir, what is your name, please?

03:36.884 --> 03:37.983
Terminal victim is male.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.451
Move the calls!
We're stacked up!

03:39.453 --> 03:40.852
He's unresponsive.
Sir, can you hear me?

03:40.854 --> 03:42.421
Kate, push it over.
We got incoming.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.388
The call's still open.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.456
Just do it!

03:44.458 --> 03:46.458
EMS, I'm pushing to you.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.694
911. What is your emergency?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.662
Kate?
Alexis?

03:50.664 --> 03:53.565
I'm scared.
I really wish we could talk,

03:53.567 --> 03:55.767
but honey,
it's a really busy day today.

03:55.769 --> 03:56.902
He's trying
to get into my house!

03:56.904 --> 03:58.503
We've been through this before.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.472
I'm sorry. I don't have time
to talk right now.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.807
Katie, please?

04:01.809 --> 04:03.475
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm hanging up.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.810
(dial tone)

04:05.546 --> 04:07.379
(screams)

04:08.916 --> 04:10.816
Who's the boss talking to?

04:10.818 --> 04:12.317
His son.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.552
ED:
You're kidding me?

04:13.554 --> 04:14.686
JULES:
Why, what's going on?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.622
Well, he hasn't seen him
in ten years.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.890
When his wife left,
he was deemed "unfit."

04:18.892 --> 04:21.893
Well, he's a different
guy now.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.631
I thought I should
tell you in person.

04:25.633 --> 04:29.835
You know, it'd be
the right thing to do.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.778
There's been a pileup on the
401. There's gonna be calls.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.547
I've got her on my line now.
She's asking for you again.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.750
She's flagged; repeat caller.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.052
She's gonna call back.
All right, put her through.

04:47.054 --> 04:50.055
Alexis, listen to me.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.490
He's in the house!

04:51.492 --> 04:52.924
Who's in the house?

04:52.926 --> 04:54.860
(hushed):
He's back! He came back!

04:54.862 --> 04:56.595
Run, Alexis!

04:56.597 --> 04:57.863
(Alexis sobs)

04:57.865 --> 04:59.798
Who's in the house, Alexis?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.934
I need cars, 235 Creekside.
Alexis?

05:02.936 --> 05:03.935
Say again.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.570
Where are you in the house?

05:05.572 --> 05:06.872
(sobbing)

05:06.874 --> 05:08.540
No, no! Run!

05:10.911 --> 05:12.444
(gunshot)
(gasps)

05:13.647 --> 05:15.447
He shot her!

05:15.449 --> 05:16.815
Find someplace to hide, Alexis!

05:16.817 --> 05:18.450
(sobbing)

05:18.452 --> 05:20.085
Kate, I didn't get the address.
Say again!

05:20.087 --> 05:21.086
Alexis?!

05:21.088 --> 05:23.388
Alexis?!

05:23.390 --> 05:24.823
He's coming!

05:24.825 --> 05:25.857
Who's coming?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.326
Daddy!

05:27.328 --> 05:28.493
Alexis!

05:28.495 --> 05:29.661
(screams)

05:31.865 --> 05:33.465
(gunshot)

05:36.437 --> 05:38.937
Kate, I need the address.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.541
It's 235...

05:42.543 --> 05:44.109
I'll do it! I'll do it.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.977
(typing)

05:45.979 --> 05:47.913
SRU.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.114
Shooting in progress,
235 Creekside!

05:49.116 --> 05:50.949
Copy that. Stay on the line.

05:50.951 --> 05:51.917
Team One, hot call!

05:51.919 --> 05:52.951
Gear up.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.120
Just hold on.
(alarm blaring)

05:57.958 --> 06:00.892
Winnie?
Shots fired, in progress.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.528
Look, I'm sorry.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.697
I gotta do this.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.966
Yeah, right.
Of course you do.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.736
No, no.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.471
Just wait here for me.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.872
I-I, I should really go.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.374
No, no, please, please,

06:15.376 --> 06:17.042
please?

06:17.044 --> 06:20.779
All right.
Movie's over in an hour.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.080
All right, thanks.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.548
Winnie?
Yeah, I'll watch him.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.384
Feed me on the fly.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.985
Copy that.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.653
Come on.
Pull up a bench, hang with me.

06:28.655 --> 06:31.089
SRU en route.
What do we know?

06:31.091 --> 06:34.426
It's a possible domestic.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.027
Um, I heard the shot.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.930
There's a child involved!

06:38.932 --> 06:43.068
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

06:43.070 --> 06:44.703
Say again?

06:44.705 --> 06:45.804
I hung up on her!

06:45.806 --> 06:48.974
And she called me!
I hung up on her!

06:48.976 --> 06:52.077
Oh, my God!

06:52.079 --> 06:53.445
(sirens wailing)

06:53.446 --> 06:54.812
Winnie, what do you got for us?

06:54.815 --> 06:56.832
Home phone is registered

06:56.833 --> 06:58.850
to a Heather Sobol, caller's
presumed her daughter, Alexis.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.051
What else?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.870
That's it.

07:01.871 --> 07:03.688
Something's going down at
911; the operator reacted,

07:03.690 --> 07:05.123
became emotional, and I can't
get her online.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.159
Winnie, just get us
some background!

07:07.161 --> 07:09.928
I'm downloading the call.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.630
You all right?

07:11.632 --> 07:13.632
Not now, Eddie.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.800
Greg...

07:17.671 --> 07:19.571
Dean wants me
to drop the lawsuit.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.772
He says he's 16,

07:20.774 --> 07:22.941
he doesn't want
to be forced to see me.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.710
He's already got a stepdad
that he loves back home,

07:25.712 --> 07:28.046
he's already got a family.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.115
He's planning on taking his
stepdad's name.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.552
Boss, I got the 911.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.188
ALEXIS:
He's in the house!

07:41.628 --> 07:43.228
He came back!

07:43.230 --> 07:45.664
HEATHER:
<i> Run, Alexis!</i>

07:45.666 --> 07:48.133
(Heather gasping)

07:51.104 --> 07:52.938
He shot her!

07:55.042 --> 07:56.908
KATE:
<i> Find somewhere</i>
<i> to hide, Alexis!</i>

07:56.910 --> 07:58.243
(screams)

07:59.746 --> 08:02.948
(gasping)

08:02.950 --> 08:04.516
<i> He's coming!</i>

08:05.118 --> 08:06.852
Daddy!

08:06.854 --> 08:08.820
KATE:
<i> Alexis?!</i>

08:13.694 --> 08:15.060
She's gone.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.761
(screams)

08:16.763 --> 08:20.832
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

08:49.129 --> 08:51.263
(emergency horn blaring)

08:52.599 --> 08:54.132
(siren wailing)

08:59.907 --> 09:00.906
How's she doing?

09:00.908 --> 09:02.173
The bullet grazed her skull.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.776
We need to talk to her
as soon as we can.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.278
Find out what
happened here.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.280
She's unconscious,
and we're stabilizing her.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.048
Let's get a read on the house.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.283
I'll get started.

09:11.285 --> 09:13.285
That back gate was forced
from the outside.

09:13.287 --> 09:14.920
Before the second shot
was fired,

09:14.922 --> 09:16.739
Alexis called Daddy.

09:16.740 --> 09:18.557
Sounds like an estranged father
abducting his kid.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.991
Yeah, but she didn't

09:19.993 --> 09:21.993
say her dad was breaking in
on the 911 call.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.829
Could be displacement.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.664
She wants to keep her mom
safe at the same time

09:25.666 --> 09:26.765
as not incriminating
her own father.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.999
Let's put out
an Amber Alert.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.001
I'm gonna go find
a photo.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.603
Sam, Wordy, let's talk
to the neighbors.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.573
We have CCTV.

09:34.575 --> 09:38.143
There are cameras outside, too.
And we got motion detectors.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.778
Mrs. Sobol was worried
about unwanted company.

09:39.780 --> 09:43.048
I'm not seeing any photos
of Alexis.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.983
Actually, I'm not seeing any
photos of anything.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.018
No photos here, either.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.788
No school calendar,

09:49.790 --> 09:51.256
no family pictures.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.359
Hey, Spike, I think I know where
those cameras fed to.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.994
You heard two gunshots?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.863
That's right.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.731
Did you see anyone
come out the front?
No.

09:59.733 --> 10:02.033
What do you know
about the Sobols?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.335
Uh, they mostly kept
to themselves.

10:03.337 --> 10:06.071
I only talked to the man once.
Philip.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.138
He was kind of rude.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.940
Never looks you
in the eye.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.109
So, Philip was living
with his wife and daughter?

10:11.111 --> 10:13.011
Yeah.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.012
They had a kid?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.680
I never saw her.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.015
Did you ever see
them argue?

10:17.017 --> 10:18.383
No, I hardly saw
them at all.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.151
Anyone hurt?

10:20.153 --> 10:21.653
Everyone's gonna be fine.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.088
We heard the gunshots
and thought...

10:23.090 --> 10:25.991
She was very lucky.
Okay, folks, thanks.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.660
Philip and Heather
Sobol weren't estranged.

10:28.662 --> 10:31.162
Maybe the intruder's
someone else.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.065
JULES:
All those closed-circuit cameras
fed into one computer.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.734
Can we play 'em back?

10:35.736 --> 10:38.169
No, someone ripped out
the hard drive.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.871
JULES:
But we found a safe.

10:39.873 --> 10:43.041
And it's a Group Two Combo.
Easy-peasy.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.743
That's  an advanced
technical term.

10:44.745 --> 10:48.046
It means they didn't change
the try-out combination.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.881
(beeping, latch clicks)

10:49.883 --> 10:51.216
We're in.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.251
WINNIE: Boss, I checked
into the Sobol family.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.886
What do you got?

10:54.888 --> 10:56.138
Nothing.
Nothing?

10:56.139 --> 10:57.389
On paper,
this family does not exist.

10:57.391 --> 10:59.057
No bank accounts.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.126
No government records.
Their house is a rental.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.861
How long have
they been living here?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.663
Three months. They paid in cash.
(phone ringing)

11:04.665 --> 11:06.264
SRU.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.166
Speaking of cash--

11:08.168 --> 11:10.969
there's like 40
or 50,000 here.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.138
We got fake I.D.'s.
Same faces

11:13.140 --> 11:14.172
and different names.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.041
Maureen, Andrew and Sasha Lowell

11:16.043 --> 11:18.009
from Ontario...

11:18.011 --> 11:21.079
the Keeflers from Manitoba,
and the Feldmans from B.C.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.981
What's going on here, guys?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.182
Identity theft?

11:24.184 --> 11:25.884
Maybe they're on the run.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.787
She wanted Daddy to protect her.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.222
She cried "Daddy" because she
wanted him to protect her.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.958
Check your PDA's.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.361
PARKER: Winnie, I'm forwarding
you photos

11:36.363 --> 11:37.862
of the father and the daughter.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.031
Alert all officers within
a 20-block radius

11:40.033 --> 11:42.517
we're looking for
an armed pursuer.

11:42.518 --> 11:45.002
SAM: Who, hopefully, hasn't
already caught up with them.
Boss, I've got 911 on the line.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.471
They say Alexis Sobol
just called in.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.473
That's great.
Put her through to me.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.808
I can't. They lost her.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.209
But the supervisor wants
to talk to you.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.777
Okay.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.013
Sergeant Parker,
Sergeant Morello.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.948
Hey, Sergeant, you had
Alexis Sobol on the line?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.183
We did.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.184
And what happened?

11:59.186 --> 12:00.251
She hung up.

12:00.253 --> 12:03.204
You get a GPS
on her position?

12:03.205 --> 12:06.156
No, her phone's no equipped, and
we couldn't triangulate in time.
What she say on the call?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.493
Nothing. She wouldn't talk
to anyone except Kate.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.494
Kate?

12:09.496 --> 12:10.962
Kate Shapland--

12:10.964 --> 12:13.415
she's one of our operators.

12:13.416 --> 12:15.867
She the operator that took
the original 911?

12:15.869 --> 12:16.935
Yes. They have a history.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.169
The child's a flagged caller.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.938
"Flagged." What does that mean?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.840
Alexis is the little girl
who cried wolf.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.075
So why does she
only talk to Kate?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.276
You'll have to ask Kate.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.411
Okay, put her on.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.879
I can't.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.949
She's in bad shape.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.951
She turned Alexis away
twice before

12:32.953 --> 12:34.519
she heard the gunshots.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.187
You're saying the two of them
have a history?

12:36.189 --> 12:37.889
Yeah, they got a kind of bond.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.691
Okay, I'm coming down.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.492
You keep her there.
I'm gonna want to talk
to her, all right?

12:41.495 --> 12:43.461
Thanks for calling.
Okay, you got it.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.497
We need more information
on this family.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.298
I mean, maybe we can get
something from this Kate.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.000
I mean, let me
ask you this--

12:49.002 --> 12:51.169
why would a little girl bond
with a 911 operator?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.471
I don't know.
That's what I want to find out.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.341
Look at the eyes.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.342
Cute.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.911
PARKER:
She feels trapped.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.546
Get Kate back on the line,

13:01.548 --> 13:03.448
in case she calls back.
(gunshots)

13:04.885 --> 13:06.317
Those were gunshots.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.052
(over radio):
Everybody down!
Shots fired. 3:12 p.m.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.255
Shots fired.
Get those people out...

13:11.391 --> 13:13.324
Where is he?

13:15.462 --> 13:16.461
I don't see him.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.296
There he is! Hey!

13:18.298 --> 13:20.131
Police! Right there, drop it!

13:20.133 --> 13:22.267
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon now!

13:22.269 --> 13:23.535
Guys, let's hit the alley.

13:23.537 --> 13:24.903
Let's split up,
let's get the alleys.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.271
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.806
Okay, Wordy, Sam...

13:27.808 --> 13:29.240
Listen, I'm going to take this
offline.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.341
No, please.
I'm sorry.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.476
He's my father.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.313
Single shooter?
He was the only
one I saw.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.848
He must have
been waiting.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.283
As soon as he saw her
come out, he raised his gun.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.284
So we pulled her to cover.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.286
Where is she?
Mrs. Sobol, relax.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.487
Where's my...?
Breathe deeply.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.588
Calm down, ma'am.
Where is she?

13:43.590 --> 13:44.989
Deep breaths.
It's going to be okay.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.291
Calm down.
It'll be okay.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.525
Where is Alexis?

13:52.065 --> 13:54.165
Daddy, can I please
have my phone?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.433
I want to call Mommy.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.901
We can't.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.069
Daddy.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.071
It's too risky.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.940
Daddy!

14:01.942 --> 14:04.075
Lexie, every time you talk,

14:04.077 --> 14:06.344
we can be traced.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.180
You know what
we have to do now.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.918
They found us.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.606
PARKER:
Wordy, go less lethal.

14:34.608 --> 14:35.874
Copy.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.910
Eddie, I'm going
to switch up, too.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.012
ED:
Boss, too dangerous.
What are they doing?

14:41.014 --> 14:43.014
Trying not to shoot the subject.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.182
PARKER:
We need him alive.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.650
ED:
He's armed. We can't risk it.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.919
PARKER:
We hit him from both sides.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.454
ED:
Sam, we're lethal

14:49.456 --> 14:50.521
if he crosses the line.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.890
Copy that.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.928
Police! Stop!
Right there!
Right there!

14:56.930 --> 14:57.929
Right there!

14:57.931 --> 14:59.163
Drop the gun! Drop it!

14:59.165 --> 15:00.565
Drop it!
Right there!

15:00.567 --> 15:02.533
Drop your
weapon now!
Drop it now!

15:02.535 --> 15:05.603
(gunshots)
Right now!
Drop it!

15:05.605 --> 15:07.639
(groans)
ED:
Subject secure.

15:07.641 --> 15:09.274
PARKER:
Let's get an I.D.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.142
Everybody's okay.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.380
(sobbing)
JULES:
Mrs. Sobol?

15:15.382 --> 15:17.081
Okay, slow down.
Slow down.
Please, please...

15:17.083 --> 15:19.217
Look at me. Heather?
Look at me. Why was...

15:19.219 --> 15:20.551
why was that man
trying to shoot you?

15:20.553 --> 15:23.187
Why are they after
your family?
EMT:
I'm sorry,

15:23.189 --> 15:24.656
but we've got
to get going.
Her family is at risk.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.691
We need to know.
And we've got to get her
to a hospital.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.127
I'm coming with you, then.
Let's go.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.641
They're 50 feet behind us.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.243
We'll do the switch
in reverse. Remember?

15:45.245 --> 15:46.945
Yeah.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.465
Why were you trying
to shoot Heather Sobol?

16:07.467 --> 16:10.068
Firing in front of cops
like that-- you're either stupid

16:10.070 --> 16:10.702
or you've got
a death wish.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.470
He's not talking.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.406
Maybe there's someone out there
who scares him

16:15.408 --> 16:16.441
more than we do.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.742
Where's Alexis?

16:17.744 --> 16:20.078
You won't find her.
Oh, no?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.046
Not before we do.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.765
We.

16:23.766 --> 16:25.483
Jules, heads up.
There's more than one shooter.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.185
<i> I'm on my way to 911.</i>

16:27.187 --> 16:29.487
JULES:
<i> Copy that.</i>
(siren wailing)

16:29.489 --> 16:32.090
Heather, who's
attacking your family?

16:32.092 --> 16:34.192
Heather?

16:37.297 --> 16:39.430
There's three of them.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.533
It was Alexis they wanted, but
now we've all seen their faces.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.669
Why are they after
your daughter?

16:44.671 --> 16:49.207
She was at a sleepover
at her best friend's--

16:49.209 --> 16:52.043
Ellie Chambers.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.113
(doorbell ringing)
<i> It was three years ago.</i>

16:55.115 --> 16:57.715
<i> And she said they heard</i>
<i> the doorbell ring...</i>

16:57.717 --> 16:59.250
<i> men talking</i>
<i> to her friend's dad.</i>

17:03.056 --> 17:04.055
(gunshot)

17:04.056 --> 17:05.055
<i> There weren't supposed</i>
<i> to be any witnesses.</i>

17:06.426 --> 17:07.625
(gunshot)

17:11.631 --> 17:13.131
(gunshot)
(gasps)
(thud)

17:17.737 --> 17:19.504
(door closing)

17:19.506 --> 17:22.106
<i> She thought she heard</i>
<i> the men go.</i>

17:22.108 --> 17:24.175
<i> She was worried</i>
<i> about her friend.</i>

17:35.355 --> 17:37.221
<i> She saw three men</i>

17:37.223 --> 17:39.323
<i> in police uniforms.</i>

17:47.400 --> 17:49.634
A neighbor was leaving.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.402
She jumped in the car.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.804
She got lucky.

17:52.806 --> 17:55.173
They put you in
witness protection?

17:55.175 --> 17:57.475
They relocated us...

17:57.477 --> 18:00.378
until the men who did
the shooting were caught.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.381
She was at risk...

18:03.383 --> 18:07.151
and she was the only one
who saw their faces.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.686
SPIKE:
Jules, this is the
Daulton Chambers case.

18:08.688 --> 18:09.821
Daulton Chambers...

18:09.823 --> 18:11.473
He was a corporate accountant
right?

18:11.474 --> 18:13.124
Mm-hmm.
Corporate accountant
who stumbled

18:13.126 --> 18:15.860
onto the wrong paper trail.
He became the key witness

18:15.862 --> 18:17.128
in the Lefroy trial.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.396
That case-- it was huge.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.164
Lefroy got off,
but Chambers was killed.

18:20.166 --> 18:23.267
That leaves Alexis as
a big loose end.

18:30.176 --> 18:33.211
JULES:
<i> Heather, how did Alexis</i>
<i> cope with this?</i>

18:33.213 --> 18:35.580
HEATHER:
<i> She's terrified of police,</i>

18:35.582 --> 18:38.649
<i> of uniforms.</i>

18:38.651 --> 18:42.220
<i> We had to start all over.</i>

18:42.222 --> 18:44.188
<i> Forget friends, forget family.</i>

18:46.526 --> 18:49.527
After two months,
they tracked us down.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.163
They broke through
the protection,

18:52.165 --> 18:55.199
and they came after Alexis.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.769
Philip says
they bought off a cop.

18:58.771 --> 19:02.473
<i> But my husband's</i>
<i> paranoia paid off.</i>

19:02.475 --> 19:05.610
<i> We were prepared,</i>
<i> and we got away.</i>

19:05.612 --> 19:07.745
JULES:
<i> What if you got separated?</i>

19:07.747 --> 19:09.814
HEATHER:
<i> We meet one week later.</i>

19:09.816 --> 19:11.282
<i> The next town</i>

19:11.284 --> 19:13.151
<i> was Niagara Falls.</i>

19:13.153 --> 19:16.921
<i> New I.D's.</i>
<i> Start all over again.</i>

19:16.923 --> 19:21.159
We taught Lexie
not to trust anyone.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.295
"If the phone rings,
you don't answer."

19:24.297 --> 19:26.430
Only 911 for help.

19:26.432 --> 19:29.834
'Cause they're civilians,
and they'll send a real cop.

19:31.271 --> 19:34.472
You don't get
to mess this up again.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.175
You don't get
to do that.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.577
Okay.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.945
It's a high-stress job.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.680
Yeah, a lot of people
can't handle it.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.781
Kate's one of my best.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.950
Alexis called twice
before the gunshots?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.919
This girl's been calling almost
every day for the last month.

19:47.921 --> 19:50.055
And how do you
deal with that?

19:50.056 --> 19:52.190
Well, if we've got time,
we talk, try and reach out.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.958
Usually it's someone lonely.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.194
Try and find them other
places to turn to.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.296
And Kate?
It went beyond that.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.781
What do you mean?

19:59.782 --> 20:01.265
The girl needed
someone to talk to.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.867
So did Kate.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.268
She lost her own daughter

20:04.270 --> 20:06.270
three years ago.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.972
Okay. Where is she?

20:07.974 --> 20:09.740
She's in the Quiet Room.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.409
I'll take you to her.
Thanks.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.244
(door opening)

20:13.246 --> 20:14.879
Jules get descriptions?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.581
Yeah. We got
two accomplices.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.516
These are guys from
the Lefroy trial.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.685
That explains
why he's not talking.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.387
Yeah, he's not the kind of boss
you can afford to disappoint.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.593
Kate.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.962
You're not making me
go back out there.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.697
No one's going
to make you do anything.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.498
What was I supposed to do?

20:34.500 --> 20:35.766
You were doing your job.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.301
When she calls

20:37.303 --> 20:39.670
I send a car, and
it's-it's a meter reader,

20:39.672 --> 20:41.639
it's the neighbor
taking out the garbage.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.341
It's... I don't know,

20:43.343 --> 20:44.675
somebody selling
something door-to-door.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.310
How was I supposed to know?

20:46.312 --> 20:47.912
(sobbing):
I didn't know.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.747
No one's blaming you.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.885
I'm not getting anyone
else killed.

20:54.887 --> 20:59.257
You reached out to a girl who
is lonely and who is scared.

20:59.259 --> 21:02.360
Now I think she's going to call
again, and you need to be

21:02.362 --> 21:03.694
strong for her.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.763
But she's...
No.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.032
No, she wasn't shot.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.034
We think she's still alive,
but she's still out there.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.402
We need to find her,

21:11.404 --> 21:13.271
and I need
your help.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.640
I can't go back out there.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.608
Yes, you can, Kate.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.019
Lexie?

21:31.691 --> 21:33.691
I got Alexis. She wants Kate.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.860
Keep her on that line.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.361
Hang on, honey, she's coming.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.297
Damn it.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.837
Damn it.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.371
All you got to do is ask where
she is and to hold tight

21:47.373 --> 21:49.340
till we can help
her and her dad.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.477
You can do this.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.416
Just tell her that
she can trust us.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.318
You ready?
You put her through.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.485
Go.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.554
Alexis.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.393
Alexis, never
do that to me.

22:09.395 --> 22:11.729
She's not there.
It's disconnected.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.064
Okay, where is she calling from?

22:13.066 --> 22:14.932
Uh...
(typing)

22:14.934 --> 22:17.468
It's a pay phone.
The bus terminal.

22:17.470 --> 22:20.871
Team One, Alexis just
called from a bus station.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.973
Bay Street Terminal?
Bay Street Terminal.

22:22.975 --> 22:26.510
Copy that, boss.
We're on our way. Let's go.

22:27.914 --> 22:30.915
I just wanted to ask
if Mommy's okay.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.917
Please, can't we just ask?

22:32.919 --> 22:34.719
Listen. You saw what happened.

22:34.721 --> 22:37.455
She's not. Maybe she's not.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.557
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.659
We can just ask.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.094
Why can't we just ask?

22:43.096 --> 22:44.762
Please, Daddy.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.097
We can't.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.465
Remember the rule:

22:47.467 --> 22:49.533
We keep moving,
and we don't look back.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.704
I'm not going anywhere.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.108
It's what Mommy
would have wanted.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.543
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

22:59.545 --> 23:02.413
More than anything, that's
what she would have wanted.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.482
(sniffles)

23:08.121 --> 23:10.121
Here's your bag.

23:10.123 --> 23:11.722
I love you.

23:12.458 --> 23:13.858
Let's go.

23:15.661 --> 23:17.161
Guys, there's a bus
for Niagara Falls

23:17.163 --> 23:18.662
<i> leaving in 15 minutes.</i>

23:18.664 --> 23:20.498
ED:
<i> Copy that.</i>

23:20.500 --> 23:23.401
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

23:40.753 --> 23:43.087
Go ahead. Get a seat, honey.

23:44.657 --> 23:47.425
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

24:09.215 --> 24:11.081
She's not in here!

24:13.152 --> 24:14.552
Don't move.
(passengers gasping
and screaming)

24:14.554 --> 24:16.220
MAN:
He's got a gun!

24:22.728 --> 24:24.161
Call off your friend.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.896
No.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.568
You.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.537
Give him
your cell phone.

24:38.811 --> 24:39.810
Call him off.

24:39.812 --> 24:40.911
It's over.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.480
He'll get her.

24:43.216 --> 24:45.249
It's over, huh?

24:45.251 --> 24:47.251
Okay.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.520
It's over.

24:55.761 --> 24:58.195
(sirens wailing)

25:07.707 --> 25:09.006
You might want
to put that gun away.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.608
I don't think so.

25:12.245 --> 25:14.245
Okay, we've got Philip Sobol.

25:14.247 --> 25:17.014
He has got a gun
on the subject.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.016
The victim is now
the gunman.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.684
Repeat-- the victim
is now the gunman.

25:20.686 --> 25:21.785
Any sign of Alexis?

25:21.787 --> 25:23.120
ED:
It's hard to say.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.689
Let's focus on getting
that weapon out of play.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.057
If Philip surrenders
his handgun,

25:27.059 --> 25:29.226
he could be shot
by the subject.

25:29.228 --> 25:32.630
Copy that. Guys, let's get these
civilians out of range.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.298
Let's do it now. Move.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.666
Let's go, folks.

25:35.668 --> 25:36.767
Please, let's go. Let's go.

25:36.768 --> 25:37.867
Let's get out of here.
JULES: Let's go.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.203
Let's go. Let's go.
ED: Go, go, go.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.871
This way.
Go.
Go.

25:40.873 --> 25:41.972
Go, go.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.310
Philip Sobol, my
name's Ed Lane.

25:46.311 --> 25:48.044
I'm with the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.615
You people are late-- again.

25:51.617 --> 25:53.651
Philip, the passengers
on this bus are not involved

25:53.653 --> 25:55.686
in your dispute with this
man, so I'm going to ask you

25:55.688 --> 25:57.688
if you could just release
them immediately.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.990
Could you do that?

25:59.992 --> 26:01.325
Philip?

26:02.695 --> 26:04.028
They can go.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.563
Go! Everybody, go!

26:05.565 --> 26:06.764
Everybody out!

26:06.766 --> 26:08.282
ED:
Thanks, Philip.
Let's go, folks.

26:08.283 --> 26:09.799
Let's go. People at the
front of the bus first.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.105
Let's go.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.139
Excuse me. Was this
little girl on the bus?

26:15.141 --> 26:17.675
SAM:
Sir, did you see this girl
board the bus?

26:17.677 --> 26:18.976
JULES:
Is this little
girl on the bus?

26:18.978 --> 26:20.177
No? Okay.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.880
Ma'am, ma'am,
have you seen this girl?

26:24.650 --> 26:27.151
(panting)

26:29.822 --> 26:30.955
SPIKE (over radio):
I think I got somebody.

26:30.957 --> 26:31.956
PARKER:
Go ahead, Spike.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.691
I got a witness who saw her

26:33.693 --> 26:35.025
with her father at
the public lockers.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.627
Gonna see if they
left anything behind.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.295
Will you show me?
Hey, boss, if she
was traumatized

26:38.297 --> 26:39.863
by the police, she might run.

26:39.865 --> 26:41.231
We're going to have
to earn her trust.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.900
Yeah, copy that, Jules.
I'm working on it.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.336
I'm listening
to the calls

26:45.338 --> 26:47.071
she made to 911.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.740
When was the last time
you talked to Alexis?

26:49.742 --> 26:51.809
KATE (over speaker):
It was just yesterday.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.210
PARKER:
What did you talk about?

26:53.212 --> 26:54.745
What's he doing?

26:54.747 --> 26:56.213
He's profiling.

26:56.214 --> 26:57.680
He's trying to understand Alexis
so he can help her.

26:57.683 --> 27:00.284
There's nobody
better than him.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.086
Really?

27:02.088 --> 27:03.821
Really.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.124
KATE (over speaker):
And what about Maurice?

27:07.126 --> 27:08.959
How's he doing?

27:08.961 --> 27:10.694
Oh, he's good.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.096
He says hi.

27:12.098 --> 27:14.198
Hey, Mo. Same to you.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.401
He's getting the hang
of fractions, finally.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.336
Well, those can be tough.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.672
He didn't understand about,

27:21.673 --> 27:24.007
like, how you could have
four-thirds or six-fifths.

27:24.010 --> 27:28.012
How can you have more of a thing
than the whole thing?

27:28.014 --> 27:29.780
That's a smart question.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.281
How'd you explain it to him?

27:31.283 --> 27:32.950
I said...

27:32.952 --> 27:35.319
it's like...
you're a whole thing.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.688
I'm a whole thing.

27:37.690 --> 27:41.725
But when we're together,

27:41.727 --> 27:45.896
we're each sort of...

27:45.898 --> 27:48.132
more.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.168
Are you there?

27:52.938 --> 27:55.005
Yeah. (chuckles)

27:55.007 --> 27:57.408
Wow. That's a good answer.

28:08.821 --> 28:09.953
She, uh...

28:09.955 --> 28:12.322
she reminds you
of your daughter?

28:13.292 --> 28:14.925
Yeah.

28:17.797 --> 28:21.765
When my daughter was sick,
we did homework together.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.801
Until the very end.

28:23.803 --> 28:27.971
Yeah, that pain doesn't go away,
does it?

28:27.973 --> 28:30.908
I mean, this job--
that doesn't make things easier.

28:32.912 --> 28:36.880
You just have to survive
other people's losses every day.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.783
People who deserve to live.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.852
Like your daughter.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.290
PARKER:
<i> People who trust you,</i>

28:46.292 --> 28:48.892
<i> people who get close to you,</i>

28:48.894 --> 28:51.795
<i> people who depend on you.</i>

28:51.797 --> 28:53.931
(panting)

28:55.067 --> 28:59.903
And then, sometimes...

28:59.905 --> 29:02.806
sometimes those people
just go away.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.211
PARKER:
So what's the point?

29:07.213 --> 29:11.014
Why... why let anyone matter?
(chuckles)

29:12.051 --> 29:14.017
Your job and my job,

29:14.019 --> 29:17.821
and how precious it is
to find someone...

29:17.823 --> 29:21.358
someone pure, someone real,
like a friend,

29:21.360 --> 29:24.294
in the middle
of all this mess, right?

29:25.898 --> 29:28.866
She's not going to want
to talk to us-- Alexis.

29:28.868 --> 29:31.435
She's going to want
to talk to you.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.937
She doesn't have any friends
except you and, uh,

29:33.939 --> 29:35.973
Maurice.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.041
(inhales deeply)

29:40.946 --> 29:43.981
PARKER:
<i> Now, you know</i>
<i> what she's going through.</i>

29:43.983 --> 29:46.416
<i> Right now, she thinks</i>
<i> her mom's dead</i>

29:46.418 --> 29:48.952
and maybe her dad.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.154
You got to promise me

29:50.156 --> 29:52.222
that you're going
to see this through.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.229
I promise.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.968
Guys, CCTV shows them
taking out two bags

30:04.970 --> 30:06.103
just like this.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.471
It's got Heather Sobol's
new I.D.,

30:07.473 --> 30:09.873
a change of clothes, cash,

30:09.875 --> 30:11.375
bus ticket...

30:11.376 --> 30:12.876
In case they had
to travel separately.

30:12.878 --> 30:14.978
Yeah, but here's something
I don't get.
What's that?

30:14.980 --> 30:16.880
They knew where they were going,
so why did they need

30:16.882 --> 30:19.049
a GPS tracker?
They didn't.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.951
The gunmen must
have put it there.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.486
They had a plan B, too.

30:25.090 --> 30:27.157
(panting)

30:33.232 --> 30:35.332
(electronic trilling)

30:41.907 --> 30:43.974
ED:
Okay, Phil,
let's end this.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.108
We got your back here.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.577
Like you had our backs
three years ago?

30:46.579 --> 30:47.878
Phil, I want you
to listen to me.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.879
They already
got my wife.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.547
I've lost my little girl.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.549
Philip, Heather's alive.
Your wife's alive.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.319
Don't lie to me! I saw her.
She was shot in the head.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.888
She got lucky. Philip,
she got very lucky.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.189
And she's at
St. Pat's,

30:59.191 --> 31:01.191
and I am going
to take you there, but you know

31:01.193 --> 31:02.926
what you got to
do here, right?

31:02.928 --> 31:04.294
He's got a gun.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.496
And he is going to put
that weapon down first.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.233
One wrong move, and
we'll take him down.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.500
Wordy.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.503
WORDY:
Going to have
to double-tap the glass.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.038
ED:
All right,
nice and slow.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.573
Nice and slow.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.408
Put that gun down.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.544
Do it now.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.079
Nice and slow,
put the gun down.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.647
Nice and slow.
That's it.

31:23.649 --> 31:24.982
That's it.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.917
Set it down.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.161
Okay, Philip, I'll
take it from here.

31:38.163 --> 31:39.997
She's a ghost because of you.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.266
Philip...
She has no...

31:42.268 --> 31:44.668
friends, no school, no life.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.038
She wakes up crying
every night.

31:48.040 --> 31:51.241
She's ten years old,
and I have to rock her to sleep

31:51.243 --> 31:52.509
every night.

31:52.511 --> 31:53.944
It's all right, buddy. Come on.

31:53.946 --> 31:56.446
You tried to kill
my little girl.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.181
But he didn't,
Phillip.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.549
He didn't
because of you.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.118
No, Alexis is alive

32:01.120 --> 32:04.087
because of you,
and right now she needs you.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.358
Don't do this to her, buddy.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.027
She needs you.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.702
(sighs)

32:23.008 --> 32:24.441
ED:
Okay.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.476
Subject contained.
Let's go.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.078
JULES (over radio):
Hey, guys.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.647
Alexis borrowed a cell
phone from a girl here.

32:30.649 --> 32:33.083
She says Alexis never
returned it. She turned around,

32:33.085 --> 32:34.318
and she was gone.
That's good news.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.119
If she kept it, we can call her.

32:36.121 --> 32:37.187
Just send me
the number.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.722
And I got her location.

32:38.724 --> 32:41.725
Alexis's GPS unit is emitting
the same signal as the one

32:41.727 --> 32:44.161
in her mother's bag.
Where is she?

32:44.163 --> 32:45.495
Dundas, heading west to Beverly.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.197
On our way.

32:47.199 --> 32:49.299
Here's the number.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.002
(cell phone ringing)

32:52.004 --> 32:55.672
KATE:
Alexis, honey, are you okay?

32:55.674 --> 32:57.341
Honey, where are you going
right now?

32:57.343 --> 32:59.109
ALEXIS:
I'm tired.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.577
I know.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.145
I can't do this anymore.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.080
Yes, you can.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.315
I'm all alone now.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.084
No, you're not alone.
Your mom and dad...

33:07.086 --> 33:08.352
They got my mom and dad.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.353
Lexie,

33:09.355 --> 33:10.420
listen to me.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.122
Everything's going to be
just fine.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.623
I saw them shoot her!

33:13.625 --> 33:15.459
Her position's updated.
She's off Beverly,

33:15.461 --> 33:17.027
maybe behind the gallery.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.262
They'll just keep chasing me.

33:19.264 --> 33:20.364
I want to stop.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.466
Just keep her on the line.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.101
Lexie, don't give up on me now.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.103
Honey, you got to
stay with me, please.

33:26.105 --> 33:29.106
I just want all this to be over.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.041
(line clicks, dial tone)

33:31.043 --> 33:32.042
I lost her.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.510
No, we didn't.
(dialing)

33:33.512 --> 33:35.379
No, no.

33:35.381 --> 33:36.546
Come on, come on.
(line ringing)

33:36.548 --> 33:38.415
We're behind the gallery.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.449
No sign of Alexis.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.450
Spike?

33:40.452 --> 33:42.152
Her signal stopped moving.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.771
(phone ringing)

33:43.772 --> 33:45.389
It's 'cause she
dropped her stuff.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.124
(phone beeps)

33:48.093 --> 33:49.092
You know her better
than anybody.

33:49.094 --> 33:50.611
You know she's
a fighter.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.129
But what does she want?
Where would she go?

33:52.131 --> 33:53.497
She wants just to be normal.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.799
She wants to stop running.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.100
She wants to be
more than three-thirds.

33:58.103 --> 34:00.737
She wants a friend.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.439
JULES:
Boss, she dropped
her stuff in the park.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.374
And there's
a playground here.
I see her.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.811
Red sweater in front of a slide.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.613
Boss, there's kids,
lots of them.

34:09.615 --> 34:11.314
That's why she's going
to the playground.

34:11.316 --> 34:12.482
Okay, team,

34:12.484 --> 34:13.483
just keep your distance.

34:13.485 --> 34:14.484
She's still traumatized.

34:14.486 --> 34:15.786
She sees police, she may run.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.320
That park is beside a school.

34:17.322 --> 34:18.655
Spike, we need a lockdown.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.090
No, we can do it.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.491
East Ridge,
lock it down!
Locking it down.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.093
Uh, let me come.

34:23.095 --> 34:25.128
That was the plan.
Let's go.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.630
SAM:
We got company.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.598
Looks like the third subject.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.233
He's got the jump on us.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.735
We can't approach from here;
the square's too open.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.737
We'll put the
kids in danger.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.672
Okay, you go high,
I'm gonna go around.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.707
Don't take your eyes
off of him.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.429
Sam?

35:00.499 --> 35:02.632
In position.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.614
(kids chattering, laughing)

35:25.557 --> 35:26.857
Where is she?
Where's Alexis?

35:26.859 --> 35:28.558
Philip, we found
her in a park.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.626
A park? She's exposed?

35:29.628 --> 35:30.861
And my team's gonna
keep her safe.

35:30.863 --> 35:32.295
We're gonna
take you with us.

35:32.297 --> 35:33.530
Boss, we're on our way.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.599
We got Philip Sobol in custody.

35:45.711 --> 35:47.244
Jules, what do you see?

35:47.246 --> 35:48.478
I'm south side.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.647
Alexis is playing,

35:50.649 --> 35:51.815
she's exposed.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.317
Subject's about
20 meters right

35:54.319 --> 35:55.185
of the play structure.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.686
There civilians in the area?

35:56.688 --> 35:59.322
Nine children, three caregivers.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.491
Got to get them out of there.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.659
We do that, we'll be alerting
the subject to our presence.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.395
You want all those kids
in the crossfire?

36:05.397 --> 36:07.864
They're what's keeping her safe.
Alexis knows that.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.667
PARKER:
This guy spent three years
chasing down one witness.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.736
He's not going to
expose himself to 12 more.

36:12.738 --> 36:15.572
ED:
Okay, but, Sam,
second she's threatened...

36:15.574 --> 36:16.873
I got the solution.

36:19.278 --> 36:20.810
PARKER:
We're approaching the park.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.679
Kate...

36:22.681 --> 36:25.182
you just stay here
for now, okay?

36:25.184 --> 36:27.784
JULES: People are starting to
leave; Alexis is exposed.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.789
(whispers):
Come.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.806
PARKER:
The subject's approaching her.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.581
MAN:
Okay, guys,
time to go.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.849
Clara, Hanna,
Victoria, Mitchell.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.690
Time to go.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.225
PARKER:
Last cover's leaving.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.594
ED:
Copy.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.362
Lillian.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.503
Lillian.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.718
SAM:
Boss, how much closer?

37:34.720 --> 37:36.286
PARKER:
Stand by.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.354
Imminent threat only.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.723
SAM:
Standing by.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.426
I'm gonna lose him.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.828
No solution, no solution!

37:44.830 --> 37:46.997
(gasps)

37:46.999 --> 37:50.634
I haven't slept in three years
because of you.

37:50.636 --> 37:53.370
Me, neither.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.373
(gunshot, Alexis screams)

38:00.345 --> 38:01.978
(gasps)

38:01.980 --> 38:03.980
Subject down.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.018
(gasping)

38:09.821 --> 38:12.789
(whimpering softly)

38:18.430 --> 38:19.763
Alexis?

38:19.765 --> 38:20.964
Go away!

38:20.966 --> 38:22.932
You can come out. It's over.

38:22.934 --> 38:24.634
Go away!

38:24.636 --> 38:26.703
KATE:
Alexis?

38:28.840 --> 38:30.774
Honey, it's me.

38:30.776 --> 38:31.841
It's Katie.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.545
Katie?

38:50.362 --> 38:51.428
Alexis.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.614

¶ I've been lost... ¶

39:24.463 --> 39:25.462
You good?

We're good.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.798
How are you?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.767
Good debriefing
without me?

39:30.769 --> 39:32.736
How'd it go?

39:32.738 --> 39:33.870
It was good.
Protocol.

39:33.872 --> 39:37.407
Ongoing.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.476
Hey.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.413
(chuckles softly)

39:43.415 --> 39:48.118
¶ And you raise your hands ¶

39:48.120 --> 39:49.119
Come on.

39:49.121 --> 39:50.120
Yeah, yeah.

39:50.122 --> 39:52.889
Uh, hey, sorry, man, I-I...

39:52.891 --> 39:55.992
Sorry I had to
take off like that before.

39:57.662 --> 39:58.661
That girl--

39:58.663 --> 40:01.398
she okay?

40:02.067 --> 40:03.400
Yeah.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.068
Yeah, yeah, she's gonna be okay.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.737
That's good.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.908
Hey, buddy.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.610
Remember me? Ed?

40:13.612 --> 40:14.611
Huh?

40:14.613 --> 40:15.812
He used to have hair.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.547
Come on.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.816
Uh, yeah, we used to
go over to your place.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.084
That's right.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.519
Clark?

40:22.521 --> 40:24.721
That's right.

40:24.723 --> 40:25.989
You guys were
the same age. Good.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.490
You had that,
uh, golf course

40:27.492 --> 40:28.625
behind your
place, right?

40:28.627 --> 40:30.727
Yeah, we used to
steal golf balls

40:30.729 --> 40:31.995
when people got
them on the green.

40:31.997 --> 40:34.664
So how's the life
of crime going?

40:34.666 --> 40:36.966
I've pulled back a bit.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.802
ED:
That's good to hear.

40:38.804 --> 40:40.470
Good to see you, Dean.

40:40.472 --> 40:41.905
You, too.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.039
All right.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.441
Yeah, we'll see you later.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.009
Okay.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.815
You hungry?

40:51.817 --> 40:53.850
I buy you a pizza?

40:53.852 --> 40:56.686
You got any pasta?

40:56.688 --> 40:57.821
I could make something.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.022
You cook?

40:59.024 --> 41:01.691
Well, I cook pasta.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.562
I'll just get my coat,
all right?

41:05.564 --> 41:06.896
Okay.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.937
Dispatch, can you tell me
where Car 121 is, please?

41:18.877 --> 41:25.148
