00:04.549 --> 00:08.685
Hello, I'm Patrick Stewart,
theatre genius.

00:08.703 --> 00:11.521
Late last year, I found

00:11.539 --> 00:14.958
unsuccessful New York
playwright Chester Winkle

00:14.993 --> 00:18.862
dead in his
extended-stay hotel room.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.414
Among his belongings were a hot plate,

00:21.524 --> 00:23.949
a stack of Baby Gap catalogs,

00:24.399 --> 00:27.427
and 12 <i>American Dad</i> episodes

00:27.547 --> 00:29.206
he had written for the stage

00:29.241 --> 00:31.759
in one cocaine-fueled night.

00:31.793 --> 00:34.929
They were literally
the finest collection of words

00:34.963 --> 00:37.481
ever put to paper.

00:37.516 --> 00:40.568
And now, we're proud to present

00:40.602 --> 00:42.687
the only one of
Mr. Winkle's plays

00:42.721 --> 00:45.723
I didn't eat out of sheer jealousy:

00:45.757 --> 00:49.226
<i>Blood Crieth Unto Heaven.</i>

00:49.277 --> 00:51.278
(applause)

00:51.398 --> 00:58.951

00:59.071 --> 01:00.988
(clears throat loudly) Shh!

01:04.292 --> 01:05.559
Hurry, everyone!

01:05.594 --> 01:07.461
Stan'll be here any moment.

01:07.669 --> 01:09.703
Do you think he'll like my gift, Mother?

01:09.737 --> 01:12.506
If it's anything like you, sweet Steven,

01:12.540 --> 01:14.975
I'm sure he'll adore it.

01:15.009 --> 01:16.093
Lord, it's warm.

01:16.127 --> 01:17.844
Devil farted thick today.

01:17.879 --> 01:20.330
We got a face-full, didn't we?

01:20.365 --> 01:22.299
Edna, be a good girl,

01:22.333 --> 01:25.385
run downstairs and give the air
conditioner a kick, won't you?

01:25.420 --> 01:26.503
Yes, ma'am.

01:26.537 --> 01:28.155
Whoo!

01:29.123 --> 01:30.090
(quietly):
Edna.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.091
Yes, Miss Hayley?

01:31.125 --> 01:32.359
How... is...

01:32.393 --> 01:33.694
everything?

01:33.728 --> 01:35.062
Just fine, Miss Hayley.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.830
Everything...
and everyone...

01:36.864 --> 01:38.799
is just fine.

01:42.420 --> 01:43.770
Hayley...

01:43.805 --> 01:46.506
It's... been
a super long time.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.425
I miss you.

01:48.459 --> 01:50.027
I miss us...

01:50.061 --> 01:53.263
having a ton of sex.

01:53.298 --> 01:55.265
You... look tired.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.868
(sobs)

01:57.902 --> 01:59.036
(phone ringing)

01:59.070 --> 02:02.105
Smith residence, Francine speaking.

02:02.140 --> 02:04.808
You silly, stupid girl.

02:04.842 --> 02:06.810
Hello, Betty.

02:06.844 --> 02:08.662
Does this mean you won't be coming

02:08.696 --> 02:10.931
to your only son's birthday party?

02:10.965 --> 02:14.001
There's a reason Stan hasn't
celebrated his birthday

02:14.035 --> 02:15.285
since he was a child.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.587
Why couldn't you just
leave well enough alone?

02:17.622 --> 02:18.889
Enough!

02:18.923 --> 02:21.591
You and I have a very
strained relationship

02:21.626 --> 02:22.859
and we both know it!

02:22.894 --> 02:24.911
Oh, yes, we do!

02:26.781 --> 02:27.748
KLAUS:
He's here!

02:27.782 --> 02:29.599
The guest of honor is here!

02:33.338 --> 02:34.938
Francine, get my fender sponge.

02:34.973 --> 02:36.206
I hit another dog driving home...

02:36.240 --> 02:38.208
Surprise!
Ah!

02:38.242 --> 02:39.309
(laughing)

02:39.344 --> 02:40.811
â™ª Happy birth...
No!

02:40.845 --> 02:42.245
No, no, no, no, no!

02:42.280 --> 02:46.116
Stan, everybody's here to
celebrate your birthday.

02:46.150 --> 02:48.552
Well, send them all home,
'cause as far as I'm concerned

02:48.586 --> 02:49.920
I don't have a birthday!

02:53.207 --> 02:55.609
No, everybody stay. Please.

02:55.643 --> 02:58.145
Dan, put on some music.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.147
This party could use a little dancing.

03:00.181 --> 03:03.183
(slow song begins)

03:09.223 --> 03:11.458
What has gotten into you?

03:11.492 --> 03:13.193
I said no birthdays!

03:13.227 --> 03:14.594
But why?

03:14.629 --> 03:16.830
Why? I'll tell you why.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.699
But understand,
the why I'm talking about

03:18.733 --> 03:20.567
isn't the place where
poor people learn to swim

03:20.601 --> 03:22.552
and gay drifters rule the showers.

03:24.172 --> 03:26.606
I remember everything
about it so clearly.

03:26.641 --> 03:27.924
I was eight...

03:27.959 --> 03:30.260
it was the last time
I had a birthday party.

03:30.294 --> 03:33.230
And you know what my biggest
memory of that party was?

03:33.264 --> 03:34.431
Not the cake.

03:34.465 --> 03:35.866
Not the presents.

03:35.900 --> 03:39.102
It was my dad, packin' up
and walkin' out on us.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.074

03:49.363 --> 03:50.947
Daddy! No, don't go!

03:50.982 --> 03:53.650
Daddy!

03:55.753 --> 03:57.421
(gasping)

03:59.173 --> 04:01.441
Stan, I never knew.

04:01.476 --> 04:02.659
Yeah.

04:02.693 --> 04:03.960
But I'm glad he's gone.

04:03.995 --> 04:05.195
He was a thief.

04:05.229 --> 04:06.847
And now he's in jail, where he belongs.

04:06.881 --> 04:07.998
Daddy?

04:08.032 --> 04:09.866
Would you like to open
my gift now, Daddy?

04:09.901 --> 04:10.934
Not now, son!

04:10.968 --> 04:12.169
Damn this birthday!

04:12.203 --> 04:13.487
Damn it straight to hell!

04:16.055 --> 04:18.024
(car engine revs, tires squeal)

04:18.059 --> 04:19.659
This birthday's ruined!

04:19.694 --> 04:21.862
Not just yet, little Klaus.

04:21.896 --> 04:23.980
Not just yet.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.048
Dolores.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.983
Connect me to the favor department.

04:27.018 --> 04:29.352
I'm calling in a favor.

04:29.387 --> 04:31.655
Where did you go, Stan?

04:31.689 --> 04:35.158
Swept up by a wave of
your own darkness...

04:36.360 --> 04:37.594
Go easy, bro.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.720
Curse my cursed birthday!

04:46.754 --> 04:48.755
(siren wails)

04:54.479 --> 04:56.680
Oh.
Am I interrupting?

04:56.714 --> 04:57.881
Oh, no, Mr. Bullock,

04:57.915 --> 04:59.516
I'm just tinkerin' with
the air coldener.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.451
Well, I won't be a bother.

05:01.486 --> 05:03.854
Just down for a bottle of champagne.

05:03.888 --> 05:07.240
People upstairs,
they can't get enough of it.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.259
To throw in people's faces...

05:11.262 --> 05:13.663
Never cared much for the bubbly myself.

05:13.698 --> 05:15.132
Water's my drink.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.300
That's so refreshing.

05:17.335 --> 05:19.269
You should try it with a twist of lime.

05:19.303 --> 05:20.837
(laughing heartily) Edna!

05:20.872 --> 05:23.123
I'm not talking about water--

05:23.157 --> 05:24.858
water's disgusting.

05:24.892 --> 05:29.830
No, I'm talking about
your attitude re: water.

05:29.864 --> 05:35.135
Why can't more people be poor
and simple, like you?

05:35.169 --> 05:38.939
Oh, sir, I wish more people
were like you, to be honest.

05:38.973 --> 05:40.507
I'm sorry;
I've spoken out of turn.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.542
Oh, no, it was your turn.

05:42.577 --> 05:44.277
I'd just spoken.

05:44.312 --> 05:46.346
And now it's my turn again.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.483
And I'm going to use that turn...

05:49.517 --> 05:51.518
to do this!

06:08.286 --> 06:12.122
The party ended hours ago
and he's still not back.

06:12.156 --> 06:14.424
Well, if you hear
from Stan, let me know.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.160
Thank you,
Mrs. Fartface.

06:18.863 --> 06:20.030
That must be him!

06:22.083 --> 06:23.750
Officer O'Sullivan?

06:23.784 --> 06:26.052
Sorry to bother you
so late, Mrs. Smythe,

06:26.087 --> 06:29.606
but I believe I found
something of yours.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.740
Stan?

06:30.775 --> 06:32.442
He was eatin' crab and drivin'.

06:32.476 --> 06:33.677
(gasps)

06:33.711 --> 06:35.445
He'd be spending the night
in the cooler,

06:35.479 --> 06:37.914
if there was anything illegal
about what he was doin'.

06:37.949 --> 06:39.182
Thank you, Ronan.

06:39.217 --> 06:41.218
We'll take it from here.

06:41.752 --> 06:42.719
We?

06:42.753 --> 06:44.487
Who's we?
MAN: Me.

06:44.522 --> 06:46.323
You!

06:46.357 --> 06:48.258
That's right.
Your dad.

06:48.292 --> 06:49.893
You're...
Your daddy.

06:49.927 --> 06:51.528
No, I mean, you're...
Ready for a swim.

06:51.562 --> 06:52.662
No, I'm surprised you're...

06:52.697 --> 06:53.797
Out of jail?
Yes.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.165
Me too.

06:55.199 --> 06:57.500
I called the warden and got him
out for your birthday.

06:57.535 --> 06:59.569
It's time you two talk.

06:59.604 --> 07:01.071
(gasps)

07:10.843 --> 07:14.079
And now, we return to Act Two.

07:14.113 --> 07:15.547
Gesundheit!

07:15.581 --> 07:17.582
Just kidding.

07:19.252 --> 07:22.287
The theatre can be a lonely place.

07:31.214 --> 07:32.714
What the hell are you doing here?

07:32.748 --> 07:34.299
You're supposed to be in jail!

07:34.333 --> 07:36.801
I called in a favor to the warden.

07:36.836 --> 07:38.670
He's my brother, remember?

07:38.704 --> 07:40.021
Oh, yeah.

07:40.056 --> 07:43.608
I figured if your dad's the one
who ruined your birthdays,

07:43.643 --> 07:45.844
maybe he's the one who can fix them.

07:45.878 --> 07:47.662
Well, I'm sorry you wasted your time.

07:47.697 --> 07:51.049
'Cause I ain't got squat
to say to this low-life.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.250
All the same to me.

07:52.285 --> 07:54.236
Warden only released me for eight hours

07:54.270 --> 07:55.704
and I just want to swim.

07:55.738 --> 07:57.005
Damn this heat.

08:00.092 --> 08:02.777
You can't swim your way
out of this one, Jack.

08:02.812 --> 08:05.880
Now, you're both gonna
sit here and talk this out.

08:16.459 --> 08:17.926
Why did you leave?

08:17.960 --> 08:18.927
Why did you stay?

08:18.961 --> 08:20.128
I was eight!

08:20.162 --> 08:21.296
I just ate!

08:21.330 --> 08:23.231
That's why I can't swim right now.

08:23.266 --> 08:26.067
Not for nine more minutes.

08:26.102 --> 08:27.569
You walked out on us.

08:27.603 --> 08:29.554
I remember it like it was yesterday.

08:29.589 --> 08:32.440
My eighth birthday party.

08:32.491 --> 08:34.292
I was having the time of my life.

08:34.327 --> 08:36.160
There was a cake, a clown,

08:36.195 --> 08:37.861
and all my friends were there.

08:37.895 --> 08:39.831
Oh, and my guest of honor!

08:39.865 --> 08:42.000
Police Commissioner Jared Stacy!

08:42.034 --> 08:43.835
I was in the Junior Detective's Club,

08:43.869 --> 08:45.537
he was my idol...

08:45.571 --> 08:47.455
and he came to my party!

08:47.506 --> 08:48.573
And there I am!

08:48.608 --> 08:49.741
Look at me!

08:49.775 --> 08:51.176
The birthday boy.

08:51.210 --> 08:53.845
Yes, it was the best day of my life...

08:53.879 --> 08:55.864
until it was not that.

08:55.898 --> 08:57.682
At all.

08:57.717 --> 08:59.217
(horn honks)

08:59.251 --> 09:00.385
Where to, Mac?

09:00.419 --> 09:02.420
As far away from my family as possible.

09:04.256 --> 09:05.256
Daddy!

09:08.177 --> 09:10.028
So that's how you remember it, huh?

09:10.062 --> 09:11.529
Yeah, 'cause that's how it happened.

09:11.564 --> 09:13.965
Good, 'cause that's exactly
what happened and nothing more.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.034
Enough swimming in memories.

09:16.068 --> 09:18.603
The only swimming I want
to do is in the pool!

09:26.212 --> 09:29.247
Tell me about
Chicago-style pizza, Avery.

09:29.281 --> 09:30.949
Or have you never had it?

09:30.983 --> 09:32.384
No, no, I have.

09:32.418 --> 09:34.152
Let's see.

09:34.186 --> 09:36.888
It's... deep...

09:36.922 --> 09:38.923
very deep.

09:38.958 --> 09:39.991
Is it dangerous?

09:40.026 --> 09:41.126
Were you scared?

09:41.160 --> 09:42.293
A little.

09:42.328 --> 09:44.696
Any man who says he's not is a liar.

09:44.730 --> 09:47.032
More champagne?

09:47.066 --> 09:48.800
I have to admit,

09:48.834 --> 09:51.403
you're unlike any maid I've ever known.

09:51.437 --> 09:53.805
And I've known nine.

09:53.839 --> 09:57.075
Each of them more
Jamaican than the last...

09:57.109 --> 09:59.110
until you.

09:59.912 --> 10:02.347
Avery, you make me so happy.

10:02.381 --> 10:03.548
It's funny.

10:03.582 --> 10:07.519
I feel like I could
stay down here forever.

10:07.553 --> 10:09.554
Oh, Avery!

10:09.588 --> 10:11.423
(baby fusses, cries)

10:11.457 --> 10:12.757
Who's there?

10:12.792 --> 10:13.925
What's that?

10:13.959 --> 10:15.326
I didn't hear nothin'.

10:15.361 --> 10:16.528
(baby cries)

10:16.562 --> 10:18.463
Listen! There.

10:18.497 --> 10:20.165
It sounds like a baby.

10:20.199 --> 10:21.866
Show yourself, baby!

10:24.603 --> 10:26.287
It's not mine, I'm just raising her.

10:26.322 --> 10:27.756
A baby...

10:27.790 --> 10:29.491
I'm sorry, Edna.

10:29.525 --> 10:33.228
I... can't bear
to be around them.

10:33.262 --> 10:36.164
They remind me...
of babies.

10:36.198 --> 10:40.168
You see, I was in a
relationship with this woman.

10:40.202 --> 10:44.038
She got pregnant and we lost the baby.

10:44.073 --> 10:46.207
Seeing this one, it's...

10:46.242 --> 10:49.026
it's just too painful!

10:50.096 --> 10:53.098
But Avery, we're perfect together!

10:53.132 --> 10:54.799
I'm sorry, Edna.

10:54.834 --> 10:55.967
No!

10:56.001 --> 10:57.385
If I had known I was
going to fall in love,

10:57.420 --> 11:00.138
I never would've agreed to
raise this baby for Hayley,

11:00.172 --> 11:01.806
whose baby it actually is!

11:01.841 --> 11:04.042
(gasps)

11:05.361 --> 11:07.195
Avery!

11:07.229 --> 11:09.764
(gasps) Damn this baby!

11:09.799 --> 11:11.733
Damn this heat.

11:17.757 --> 11:19.023
What the hell were you thinking

11:19.058 --> 11:21.976
bringing my son of a bitch
father back here?!

11:22.011 --> 11:23.278
Did you guys talk?

11:23.312 --> 11:25.246
Oh, we talked and we
talked and we talked!

11:25.281 --> 11:26.881
If talking were a potbellied pig,

11:26.916 --> 11:28.983
we could have entered
this one in the county fair!

11:29.018 --> 11:32.153
But life isn't... fair.

11:32.188 --> 11:35.356
And I won't <i>county</i> on
my father ever again.

11:35.391 --> 11:36.691
Stan, you're exhausted.

11:36.725 --> 11:38.326
Why don't you rest?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.978
Rest?!
Yes.

11:40.012 --> 11:41.029
(screams)

11:41.063 --> 11:43.198
Stan, you've cut yourself!

11:43.232 --> 11:44.933
Well, it's my birthday.

11:44.967 --> 11:47.168
I should be allowed to feel something.

11:47.203 --> 11:48.736
(Jack laughing in distance)

11:48.771 --> 11:50.371
Listen to him out there.

11:50.406 --> 11:52.490
Having more fun than me on my birthday.

11:52.525 --> 11:55.176
There's nothing stopping
you from having fun, too.

11:55.211 --> 11:56.578
Oh, well, what a relief!

11:56.629 --> 11:58.913
Why don't I go out there
and do just that!

12:01.767 --> 12:02.917
Yuck-yuck-yuck!

12:02.968 --> 12:04.435
What a fun party!
Yuck-yuck-yuck-yuck-yuck!

12:04.470 --> 12:05.954
Oh, is this for me?

12:05.988 --> 12:08.807
Nom-nom-nom, yuck-yuck-yuck!
Isn't this fun?!

12:08.841 --> 12:09.808
Stan...

12:09.842 --> 12:11.876
Oh, a balloon!
How fun!

12:11.911 --> 12:13.545
A doodle-doodle-doodle-doo!
A doodle-doodle-doodle-dee!

12:13.579 --> 12:15.013
I have no interest in

12:15.047 --> 12:17.649
watching you make a fool of yourself.

12:17.683 --> 12:20.685
And there he goes, everyone,
right on cue!

12:20.719 --> 12:22.804
Leaving in the middle another party!

12:22.838 --> 12:24.873
Papa, now that you're making merry,

12:24.907 --> 12:27.041
perhaps you'd like to open my gift?

12:27.076 --> 12:28.076
Not now, Steve!

12:28.110 --> 12:29.410
My cup overfloweth!

12:29.445 --> 12:31.312
I have cake-face
and balloon!

12:31.347 --> 12:34.566
Hear that, Daddy?!
Cake-face and balloon!

12:34.600 --> 12:35.733
(gasps)

12:35.768 --> 12:37.402
What... wh-wh-wh-what
is it, Father?

12:37.436 --> 12:38.403
That sound.

12:38.437 --> 12:40.038
The balloon.

12:40.072 --> 12:43.068
There was a pop just like it
the day my dad left.

12:43.177 --> 12:45.878
I remember... more.

12:45.913 --> 12:47.313
More what, Stan?

12:47.348 --> 12:50.283
More... information.

12:52.519 --> 12:54.837
<i>It was during the party,</i>
<i>before my dad left.</i>

12:54.872 --> 12:58.007
<i>I remember the balloon animal</i>
<i>the clown made for me.</i>

12:58.042 --> 12:59.108
<i>It popped.</i>

12:59.143 --> 13:00.209
<i>I started crying.</i>

13:00.244 --> 13:03.279
<i>Went searching for my mommy.</i>

13:03.314 --> 13:04.664
Mommy, my balloon!

13:04.698 --> 13:06.382
(horn honking)

13:06.417 --> 13:08.885
I-I remember another sound.

13:08.919 --> 13:10.787
A horn... or a honking.

13:10.821 --> 13:12.922
It was coming from...

13:12.956 --> 13:15.892
my parent's bedroom.

13:17.695 --> 13:20.063
Mommy!
Mommy!

13:22.716 --> 13:24.517
My dad didn't walk out on us...

13:24.551 --> 13:27.053
my mother drove him away.

13:27.087 --> 13:29.489
My mother is a clown whore!

13:29.523 --> 13:31.708
Is that any way to greet me, Stan?

13:31.742 --> 13:34.844
Mommy?!
How could you?

13:34.878 --> 13:38.014
The information, it's too much!

13:38.048 --> 13:39.082
It's...

13:39.116 --> 13:42.952
T.M.I. (gasps)

13:52.632 --> 13:54.400
Hurry up, it's starting!

13:54.434 --> 13:56.352
I don't know what we're in for.

13:56.386 --> 14:00.022
I'm a little confused whether
this is a comedy or a tragedy.

14:00.056 --> 14:03.925
A catastrophe in the end would
certainly clear things up.

14:03.943 --> 14:05.477
Let's watch!

14:11.534 --> 14:13.635
(Stan moaning)

14:16.272 --> 14:19.775
I told you throwing Stan a
birthday party was a bad idea.

14:19.809 --> 14:21.310
How was I to know

14:21.344 --> 14:23.379
Stan caught you
cheating on his father...

14:23.413 --> 14:25.297
with a clown?!

14:25.331 --> 14:26.382
STAN:
You!

14:26.416 --> 14:28.817
All these years, I blamed my father

14:28.852 --> 14:30.185
for destroying our family.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.087
And you allowed me to believe this lie

14:32.122 --> 14:33.222
when it was you.

14:33.256 --> 14:34.623
You're the reason he left!

14:34.657 --> 14:36.792
Stan, you don't understand.

14:36.826 --> 14:38.560
I understand
you can't keep your legs shut

14:38.595 --> 14:40.863
if there's a curly wig
and big shoes in the room.

14:40.897 --> 14:43.131
Is it gift time, Daddy?

14:43.149 --> 14:44.183
(grunts angrily)

14:44.234 --> 14:45.801
(gasps)

14:48.288 --> 14:50.089
Trying to forget something?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.223
(gasps)

14:51.257 --> 14:53.475
Why did you tell me
you'd had a miscarriage?

14:53.510 --> 14:55.177
I was scared!

14:55.211 --> 14:56.678
I wasn't ready for a baby.

14:56.713 --> 14:59.248
And you, you were so enthusiastic!

14:59.282 --> 15:02.301
I just wanted it all to go away!

15:02.335 --> 15:04.036
But I loved you.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.370
If you'd given it a chance,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.940
there was nothing our
love couldn't overcome!

15:07.974 --> 15:09.591
I know that now!

15:09.626 --> 15:11.460
Really? Already?

15:11.494 --> 15:12.461
Yes!

15:12.495 --> 15:13.662
Then let's be together!

15:13.696 --> 15:15.564
Oh, Avery!

15:15.598 --> 15:17.332
Let's go get our child

15:17.367 --> 15:19.668
and begin our life together anew!

15:27.377 --> 15:30.012
We can be together now, Avery.

15:30.046 --> 15:31.180
I solved the problem.

15:31.214 --> 15:33.215
What is she talking about?

15:33.249 --> 15:36.819
It's quiet now.
Just like you wanted.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.621
Edna, what have you done?

15:39.656 --> 15:41.590
What on Lucifer's black beach
have you done?!

15:41.624 --> 15:43.559
Where's my baby?!

15:43.593 --> 15:45.627
Your... baby?

15:47.230 --> 15:48.864
No!
No!

15:48.882 --> 15:50.766
I didn't know!

15:50.800 --> 15:53.252
Avery, I did it so we could be together!

15:53.286 --> 15:56.255
(all sobbing hysterically)

15:56.289 --> 15:57.723
There's no distinction!

15:57.757 --> 16:00.476
No demarcation!

16:00.510 --> 16:04.963
Hell and earth slumber in
the same bed tonight!

16:04.998 --> 16:06.398
(sobbing continues)

16:10.770 --> 16:14.089
Swimming, swimming in the swimming pool.

16:14.124 --> 16:18.060
Perhaps I'll do a froggy kick,
to swim from me to you.

16:18.094 --> 16:19.128
Daddy!

16:20.396 --> 16:24.349
Stan! I was just reciting
"The Swimming Pool" by Homer.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.084
Daddy, I know the truth!

16:26.119 --> 16:27.152
It wasn't your fault.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.855
You left because mom pushed you away!

16:29.889 --> 16:32.141
She's a no-good clown whore!

16:32.175 --> 16:34.126
You watch your punk mouth!

16:34.177 --> 16:35.377
Your mother is a rose!

16:35.411 --> 16:38.147
And you're just a weed
that grows in her shade!

16:38.181 --> 16:40.315
But she cheated on you.

16:40.350 --> 16:42.384
She deserves the wretched mud I sling!

16:42.418 --> 16:43.519
I didn't want

16:43.553 --> 16:45.287
to take you down this gravelly road.

16:45.321 --> 16:46.688
Not on these tires.

16:46.723 --> 16:49.558
But I can't let you think
your only mother's a whore.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.894
It's time for you to hear...

16:51.928 --> 16:53.094
the truth.

16:53.112 --> 16:55.247
Jack, please don't go down that road.

16:55.281 --> 16:56.448
Not on those tires.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.283
Sorry, Bets.
The hand of fate is

16:58.318 --> 17:00.085
about to extend three of its fingers

17:00.119 --> 17:03.322
and give Stan one hell of a shocker.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.790
Pop!
There you are.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.659
You remember this part, I know.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.394
Your balloon dog had just popped

17:09.429 --> 17:11.262
and you were looking for your mommy

17:11.297 --> 17:12.964
like a bitch...

17:12.999 --> 17:17.169
(horn honking)
Mommy! Mommy, my balloon!

17:17.203 --> 17:21.173
JACK: You want the truth, Stan?
It's just beyond that door.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.008
Push...

17:23.041 --> 17:25.510
Push the door open.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.063
That's right.

17:28.097 --> 17:30.232
Your mother was receiving a clown pound.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.701
But what you don't know is
that the clown...

17:32.735 --> 17:33.969
was me!

17:34.003 --> 17:36.455
(both scream)

17:36.489 --> 17:39.274
Oh, so everything's okay.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.676
Mom never cheated on you.

17:40.710 --> 17:42.778
You were just having sex
with your wife...

17:42.812 --> 17:44.596
in a clown outfit.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.298
Why were you dressed as a clown?

17:46.332 --> 17:49.835
Oh, you had to have a clown
at your birthday.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.538
Otherwise, your party
wasn't going to be "perfect."

17:53.590 --> 17:56.491
But your father and I didn't
have any money for a real clown.

17:56.526 --> 17:58.360
Clowns were scarce in those days.

17:58.394 --> 18:00.762
The good ones could name
their own price.

18:00.797 --> 18:02.231
Not like now.

18:02.265 --> 18:05.033
Oh, but you needed a clown.

18:05.068 --> 18:08.170
And you threw a tantrum
fit for a real queen.

18:08.204 --> 18:12.341
So I pulled out the clown suit
that I used

18:12.375 --> 18:14.376
for robbing fruit trucks around town.

18:14.410 --> 18:17.312
That's why we always
had the freshest fruit.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.615
Right. Now a lot
of people were horny

18:19.649 --> 18:21.049
to catch that clown.

18:21.084 --> 18:26.021
None more so than your friend
the police commissioner.

18:26.039 --> 18:27.239
I always managed

18:27.290 --> 18:29.725
to stay one oversized
step ahead of him...

18:29.759 --> 18:32.177
until your birthday.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.365
Thanks to you,

18:37.383 --> 18:39.751
there I was, performing in that outfit.

18:39.802 --> 18:42.971
And there he was, your invited guest.

18:43.006 --> 18:46.758
He put the whole thing together
like two docking hogs in

18:46.809 --> 18:50.028
the bathroom of a
San Francisco supermarket.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.396
What are you saying?

18:51.431 --> 18:54.633
He's saying that he gave you
the party you wanted...

18:54.667 --> 18:57.269
even though he knew it meant
giving up his freedom.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.038
The Commissioner called
for backup, and I fled.

19:00.073 --> 19:03.075
I fled like a guy sprinting
from a supermarket bathroom

19:03.109 --> 19:05.477
after trying something that felt
great at the time,

19:05.511 --> 19:08.397
but that he was ultimately ashamed of.

19:08.431 --> 19:11.967
Of course, before I left,
I had to show your mother

19:12.001 --> 19:14.403
just how much I loved her one last time.

19:14.437 --> 19:16.071
Oh, Jack.

19:16.105 --> 19:20.375
That means...
it was <i>my</i> fault you left.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.576
Bingo.

19:21.611 --> 19:24.780
I... destroyed
our family!

19:24.814 --> 19:26.581
You sure did, kiddo.

19:26.616 --> 19:28.517
Time to go back to the slammer, Jack.

19:28.551 --> 19:30.619
Aw...!

19:30.653 --> 19:33.822
I wish things could've been
different, Bets.

19:33.856 --> 19:36.224
I never stopped loving you, Jack.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.093
(sobbing)

19:38.127 --> 19:40.145
No, no...

19:40.179 --> 19:41.613
Not again!

19:41.647 --> 19:43.715
Everything's been my fault.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.118
All these years we'll never get back.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.819
Here's your present, Papa!

19:47.854 --> 19:48.954
Steve!

19:48.988 --> 19:50.589
Let me guess:
you don't have time.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.424
Well, how 'bout I open it for you?

19:52.458 --> 19:53.759
(grunts)

19:53.793 --> 19:57.596
Here, it's an authentic
19th-century Army revolver.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.865
Not that you care!

19:59.899 --> 20:01.233
Thank you, son.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.302
This is just what I need.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.504
Really?

20:05.538 --> 20:08.573
Th-that's all
I've ever wanted.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.526
Oh, Daddy, I'm so happy.

20:11.561 --> 20:12.828
(screams)

20:12.862 --> 20:14.012
Stan!

20:14.047 --> 20:16.281
I hope the party was worth it.

20:16.315 --> 20:21.019
Steve, what have you done
to this family?!

20:21.054 --> 20:23.088
(all sobbing)

20:26.209 --> 20:28.810
It appears the guilt that consumed Stan

20:28.845 --> 20:33.215
will now be passed on to Steve.

20:33.249 --> 20:36.918
In a sense...
his only inheritance.

20:49.899 --> 20:52.250
(grunts)

20:52.285 --> 20:55.587
You thought I was asleep, didn't you?

20:55.621 --> 20:57.906
Acting.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.040
Good night!
