00:51.251 --> 00:53.527
You made it after all.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.165
Yeah, I made it.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.897
God, how the hell are you?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.663
I'm good, Mitch.

01:00.827 --> 01:04.001
- Been a longtime, buddy. Long time.
- Good to see you.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.940
- Come on in. Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.678
How are those ramps
coming over there, bud?

01:12.839 --> 01:14.045
They're coming along.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.448
I tell you I'm gonna be
around here a week?

01:16.610 --> 01:18.419
Yeah, you said that.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.189
It's the longest I've been...

01:22.349 --> 01:24.795
out of New Orleans in forever.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.758
You still practicing?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.127
Yeah, I still practice. Still love it.

01:29.957 --> 01:33.063
I guess I'll be in my grave
when they're shoveling dirt...

01:33.226 --> 01:37.402
and I got my arm out with a scalpel
in my hand still trying to operate.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.906
Yeah.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.647
This is so delicious,
you're not gonna believe it.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.155
This is like angels
pissing on your tongue.

01:53.313 --> 01:54.383
Okay.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.993
Very, very good.

01:56.149 --> 01:57.287
Thank you.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.124
You're welcome.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.100
That is good.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.174
- Thanks for...
- it's a great batch, baby.

02:12.332 --> 02:14.243
- Thanks for cooking.
- You got it.

02:14.434 --> 02:15.845
I love to cook now.

02:16.003 --> 02:18.643
You know, I guess I got
pushed into it when...

02:18.805 --> 02:21.012
Edith Ann and I split up.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.584
But guess what.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.984
I think I've grown from it.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.455
And...

02:28.015 --> 02:29.653
I'm a better person for it.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.690
Silver lining.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.961
Silver lining. Gotta look for the silver
lining in everything, you know?

02:37.124 --> 02:38.296
Did you see that film?

02:38.458 --> 02:40.438
- Silver Linings Playbook?
- No.

02:41.428 --> 02:44.170
No, I don't go to movies
like I used to.

02:44.531 --> 02:49.105
Probably one of my favorite movies
of all time is that movie about...

02:49.302 --> 02:51.612
that kid and his daddy.
The radio show...

02:51.772 --> 02:55.345
and they lived on a houseboat
up in Washington state.

02:55.542 --> 02:58.455
- Sleepless...?
- Tom S... Hanks and...

02:59.146 --> 03:01.717
- Meg Ryan.
- Meg Ryan, yeah.

03:01.882 --> 03:05.352
She's a good-looking broad, you know?
But she didn't have no tits.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.465
I thought she was cute in the face.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.623
Is that the last film you saw?

03:10.490 --> 03:13.027
I hope that wasn't the last film you saw.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.867
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I watch movies at home.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.031
- Okay, here's a quiz.
- Go ahead.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.643
- John Wayne...
- Go ahead.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.176
Dean Martin...

03:21.334 --> 03:23.314
Ricky Nelson.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.144
Ricky Nelson?

03:25.305 --> 03:27.911
In one film together. What's it called?

03:29.509 --> 03:31.682
- Diablo.
- Cowboy film.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.325
- That's what I said. Diablo.
- Rio Bravo.

03:34.514 --> 03:36.255
Oh, well I was close.

03:36.883 --> 03:37.918
And Walter Brennan.

03:38.085 --> 03:40.929
"Y'all went down there..."

03:42.589 --> 03:45.866
You know, I was listening
to the damn radio the other day...

03:46.159 --> 03:49.402
and that song that he did
when he talks through...

03:49.563 --> 03:51.600
I don't know if you remember that song.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.335
He talks about old times
and how it is.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.539
He doesn't sing at all,
and it made the top 10.

03:57.704 --> 04:00.548
- Yeah.
- Back in 19 aught...

04:00.707 --> 04:02.914
whatever it was, okay?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.590
You know, I'm sorry
about you losing Patty.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.251
But guess what.

04:10.417 --> 04:14.058
You gotta reach down and grab
a handful of guts, bud, you know...

04:14.221 --> 04:16.064
and get on with your life.

04:16.223 --> 04:19.363
I know that you
jumped in there with Katie...

04:19.526 --> 04:21.802
and Katie trashed you.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.573
To make it work,
you gotta love them.

04:24.731 --> 04:27.143
Okay? I'm sure she was good in bed.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.712
I'm sure all this stuff was wonderful.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.781
But guess what.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.975
She didn't love you, obviously.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.244
And you didn't love her, either.

04:36.409 --> 04:40.380
I think she was just something
to fill in the gap, if you will.

04:40.547 --> 04:44.461
Put a little mortar between the bricks.
She definitely wasn't the bricks...

04:44.618 --> 04:47.792
that's holding your wall
together, okay?

04:48.321 --> 04:50.733
Anyway, I don't wanna get
too far along here.

04:50.891 --> 04:54.464
I may have to tell you something
that you might not like...

04:54.628 --> 04:57.268
- but I'm gonna tell you anyway.
- Okay. What?

04:58.598 --> 05:01.477
I bought us two first-class tickets
to Iceland.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.083
I can't afford that, Mitch.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.242
I know you can't afford it.
I already bought the tickets.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.785
- I know you say "No" -
- Come on, now, you...

05:12.012 --> 05:14.686
I know you don't want me
to spend my money on you...

05:14.915 --> 05:16.326
- You didn't ask me.
- I know.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.156
- You didn't tell me.
- But...

05:18.318 --> 05:20.764
Why should I tell you?
You would've said no.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.696
- That's true.
- Okay?

05:22.923 --> 05:24.459
I got the money.

05:24.624 --> 05:27.833
Why can't I spend it
on my brother-in-law?

05:27.994 --> 05:30.838
- My favorite brother-in-law.
- Ex-brother-in-law.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.704
It's a chance...

05:32.933 --> 05:34.844
for you to get away...

05:35.468 --> 05:37.971
to a place that is wonderful.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.608
The hot springs with all the minerals
in the water.

05:41.808 --> 05:46.518
The juicy, fantastic lobsters,
and the gorgeous broads.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.715
I don't like lobster.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.987
I'll eat your lobster.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.876
- Got something?
- Yeah, listen to this:

06:12.072 --> 06:16.020
"The head chef at the Hotel Nordica's
five-star restaurant...

06:16.176 --> 06:19.350
serves up superb seasonal dishes.

06:19.512 --> 06:23.927
Think pink-footed goose
with caramelized apples."

06:24.084 --> 06:27.827
- Can you think pink-footed goose?
- That sounds weird.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.331
But it could be good.

06:29.489 --> 06:30.559
Yeah. When in Rome.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.169
- You know how that is.
- Yep.

06:32.325 --> 06:33.895
- Do it.
- Want me to continue...

06:34.060 --> 06:36.666
- or go on to another one?
- Stay with that one.

06:36.830 --> 06:41.575
"The waiters sometimes bring out
extra little treats for you to try.

06:42.102 --> 06:46.175
For example, their amazing
invisible gazpacho."

06:46.373 --> 06:49.513
What in the hell is invisible gazpacho?

06:49.676 --> 06:51.053
I have no idea.

06:51.211 --> 06:54.351
- What else is there?
- Well, we have Dill.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.425
"A gourmet's delight...

06:56.583 --> 06:59.359
this elegant,
new Scandinavian restaurant...

06:59.519 --> 07:03.092
specializes in local
organic ingredients...

07:03.256 --> 07:06.897
cooked in contemporary
Nordic-kitchen style.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.471
Prepare yourself."

07:09.129 --> 07:11.040
- Yeah...
- Are you prepared?

07:11.197 --> 07:13.473
Yeah, I'm prepared. Come on.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.476
- You don't sound prepared.
- I'm prepared, all right?

07:16.703 --> 07:17.738
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.542
Car's ready.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.887
Oh, isn't that beautiful?

07:24.044 --> 07:26.422
Oh, good God, Mitch.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.992
- Oh, shit, I forgot. Damn it.
- What? What?

07:37.157 --> 07:40.934
I forgot the duty-free store.
I should've mentioned something earlier.

07:41.094 --> 07:45.406
- I can't believe I'm so stupid sometimes.
- You know, I kind of feel bad about...

07:45.565 --> 07:48.171
not having paid for anything so far yet.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.941
I told you, don't worry about that.

07:51.104 --> 07:54.244
You know, we're here to have
a good time. This is on me.

07:54.407 --> 07:58.480
When I run out of money, I'll say,
"Okay, Colin, it's your turn to pay."

07:58.645 --> 08:01.421
- But I think we'll be okay.
- Maybe I'll just pay...

08:01.581 --> 08:04.118
- for the booze or something.
- Oh, yeah, booze.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.322
I can see us walk in and say,
"Give us a shot of whiskey."

08:07.487 --> 08:10.024
And the guy says, "$25."

08:30.977 --> 08:32.320
Who is it?

08:32.479 --> 08:33.514
It's Colin.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.284
Come on in, Colin.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.054
Jeez, mate.
Expecting someone else, were you?

08:39.219 --> 08:42.325
God, I was hoping somebody else
was there besides you.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.469
Damn, look at this outfit you got on.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.900
What's this with the jeans
and everything?

08:47.060 --> 08:48.300
What's wrong with it?

08:48.461 --> 08:51.374
I mean, we're going out
someplace nice to eat dinner.

08:51.531 --> 08:55.001
- We ought to dress a little better.
- It's just a hotel restaurant.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.149
- Yeah, but it's still a nice one.
- It's not black tie.

08:58.338 --> 09:02.343
Yeah, but, you know, you've got business
casual, you've got resort casual.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.216
And now, with those jeans...

09:04.377 --> 09:07.324
all you need's the bibs,
you have coal-miner casual.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.221
You sound just like my kid.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.919
He's always having a go at me
to dress up better.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.861
You know, if I feel comfortable
in the way I dress...

09:15.021 --> 09:18.867
then I am much happier,
and I have a better time.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.062
How old is Michael these days?

09:21.227 --> 09:23.400
He's about to turn 34.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.335
Are you ready?

09:26.533 --> 09:30.606
Oh, I'm just about ready here. Just gotta
come down there and finish my beer.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.282
I noticed you bought beer.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.943
Yeah, I went to the supermarket,
tried to save a couple nickels...

09:36.176 --> 09:39.248
but hell, it's almost as expensive
in the supermarket...

09:39.412 --> 09:41.221
as it is downstairs in the bar.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.385
- My friend, you are not drinking beer.
- What do you mean?

09:44.584 --> 09:45.756
Well, hardly.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.523
It's 2 percent alcohol.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.894
Two percent alcohol?

09:54.060 --> 09:55.232
Balls.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.537
Well, what do you think
about your order?

10:00.700 --> 10:03.977
- I'm happy about it. We'll see.
- The more I've been thinking...

10:04.137 --> 10:06.048
I wish I'd got what you got.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.880
Well, I was thinking
the steak looked pretty good.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.648
Yeah, but you know about steaks.
It's like pussy.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.792
As long as it's nice and juicy,
it's wonderful...

10:14.948 --> 10:17.451
and when dry,
it ain't worth a damn.

10:21.254 --> 10:24.667
- I'm trying to eat more fish.
- Damn. You too.

10:24.824 --> 10:28.897
Man, I'm getting that crap from one
of my sons, big time, you know?

10:29.062 --> 10:30.769
Yeah, which one'?

10:30.930 --> 10:33.809
J.P. He's wanting me to eat fish...

10:34.000 --> 10:37.243
so I'll be healthier and live longer
and all that stuff.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.849
How are the boys?
They all good?

10:40.006 --> 10:42.418
You know, it's amazing.
They're all different.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.316
I got one that's gay.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.151
I got one that lives in Berlin.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.794
I got one that convened to Judaism.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.658
And I got one that's a regular.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.093
I'm sorry...

10:57.257 --> 11:00.329
that I haven't kept in touch
with the family.

11:01.594 --> 11:05.041
Do you see Edith Ann? Do you
talk to her? You see her any?

11:05.198 --> 11:06.268
Never.

11:06.432 --> 11:09.140
I haven't seen her
since Patricia's funeral.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.441
Well, that's something that I owe you...

11:11.638 --> 11:15.108
lots and lots and lots of apologies for.

11:15.308 --> 11:18.118
I wish I could've been there for you.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.615
I knew about it.

11:19.812 --> 11:23.521
But I just felt like, maybe me
staying away was the best thing.

11:23.683 --> 11:28.029
I just didn't know what Edith Ann'd do
if I did show up, you know?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.030
You got enough problems...

11:30.190 --> 11:34.332
and she was down in the dumps
about her sister dying, you know?

11:34.494 --> 11:35.996
Yeah.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.543
That was a really
tough time, Mitch. That was...

11:40.700 --> 11:42.077
tough.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.010
Yeah.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.851
Life goes on.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.819
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.582
Until you kick the bucket, bud.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.090
Yeah, I'm working on that.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.754
- Cheers, mate.
- Yeah.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.602
For you, fine osso buco.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.063
And for you, the Arctic char.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.772
Thank you.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.381
- Thank you very much, sir.
- You're welcome.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.539
What do you think?

12:52.572 --> 12:54.381
Anger.

12:56.075 --> 12:57.713
Blood.

13:00.647 --> 13:01.921
Creepy.

13:02.081 --> 13:03.458
Very creepy.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.460
I think I've seen this guy
in a nightmare before.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.964
That just-That gives me
the heebie-jeebies, bud.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.794
Goodness.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.167
The focus moves to the left.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.466
I like that red.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.134
I don't like anything about that.
That's too creepy for me.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.813
Now, this is right up my alley.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.352
A redhead.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.148
Firm breasts.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.087
No bra needed.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.658
Nipples...

13:35.815 --> 13:38.921
like wild strawberries.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.264
Umbilical cord...

13:43.423 --> 13:45.528
that holds the belly button...

13:45.692 --> 13:48.104
which will hold two to three...

13:48.261 --> 13:49.865
shots of tequila.

13:50.029 --> 13:52.031
And you can't see her ﬂuffy...

13:52.198 --> 13:55.611
but I'll bet you
it's nice and sweet as well.

13:57.136 --> 14:00.140
Okay, well, I see a self-portrait.

14:00.340 --> 14:04.880
I see battered and bruised, still here.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.182
And screw you.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.496
Sexy Stevie Nicks.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.142
So it's not about religion?

14:57.363 --> 15:00.537
Top o' the morning to you, matey.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.749
Oh, pardon moi.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.949
- Good morning, Mitch. How are you?
- I'm just wonderful.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.889
Good. I'm really happy about that.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.858
Why are you here?

15:19.018 --> 15:20.190
I went downstairs...

15:20.353 --> 15:23.027
checked my e-mail this morning...

15:23.222 --> 15:25.224
printed it out.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.763
- Guess what.
- What?

15:27.927 --> 15:31.101
A nice e-mail from my cousin Ellen.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.766
Okay.

15:34.367 --> 15:38.474
- Excuse me. You want a hit?
- Are you kidding? Is that what I think it is?

15:38.638 --> 15:39.981
It's just a little joint.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.642
- You know, I've smoked most of it...
- Okay.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.788
- Where did you get it?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.288
When did you get it?

15:47.447 --> 15:50.917
- I got it this morning.
- Oh, man. What time did you get up'?

15:51.083 --> 15:53.324
- Come on.
- I don't know.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.794
I just couldn't sleep...

15:54.954 --> 15:58.766
wand, you know, just didn't wanna
waste my time rolling around in bed.

15:58.925 --> 16:02.065
All right. Read the e-mail.
Tell me about it.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.969
- You sure you don't want any of this?
- I... No.

16:06.165 --> 16:09.271
I don't want any, man.
I haven't smoked pot since the '70s.

16:09.435 --> 16:12.439
That... Wait a minute. The 1970s?

16:12.605 --> 16:14.414
Yeah, the 1970s.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.783
Damn. Boy, have you been
missing a lot, bud.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.788
- Read the e-mail, all right? Just read it.
- Okay.

16:21.013 --> 16:22.083
Here we go.

16:22.281 --> 16:23.988
"Hi, Leslie."

16:24.183 --> 16:26.094
Who's Leslie?

16:26.252 --> 16:28.254
- I'm Leslie.
- Yeah?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.594
- You're Leslie?
- My name is...

16:30.756 --> 16:32.827
Leslie Mitchell.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.132
No kidding. Why don't
you use Leslie, then?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.007
Don't like it.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.802
Sounds like a girl's name.

16:39.966 --> 16:43.345
Really? I don't know. I don't think
it sounds like a girl's name.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.040
I like Leslie Nielsen.
Like, he's really funny.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.513
I'm glad you like it,
and it's a good name.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.210
Okay.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.616
"My mom just told ma...

16:52.778 --> 16:55.054
that you and a friend are in Iceland.

16:55.281 --> 16:58.285
Well, guess what.
You're not going to believe this...

16:58.451 --> 17:03.230
but my friend Janet and I have been
in Greenland for the last month...

17:03.456 --> 17:05.959
and we're coming to Reykjavik today.

17:06.157 --> 17:08.069
Wanna pick us up at the airport?

17:08.227 --> 17:10.229
If so, e-mail back soon.

17:10.396 --> 17:13.377
Flight info below. Hope to see you soon.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.069
Love, your coz, Ellen."

17:15.701 --> 17:17.806
Now, Ellen's a hottie.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.644
I've already e-mailed.
Told them we'd pick them up.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.251
So guess what, baby.

17:22.407 --> 17:26.982
We're going to party with two nice,
tight-assed ladies this evening.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.853
That's gonna be so much fun.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.017
Ooh, goodness, it's gonna be fun.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.392
You said cousin, right?

17:33.553 --> 17:34.725
Yeah, cousin.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.892
I'm just saying is,
it's good for us...

17:38.057 --> 17:41.095
to hang around
with good-looking women...

17:41.260 --> 17:44.707
because good-looking women
begot other good-looking women.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.935
Even you might get lucky.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.579
- Yeah.
- I've seen you look at the women...

17:49.735 --> 17:52.238
in those leggings
that they wear around...

17:52.405 --> 17:56.080
that looks like their ass
is sculptured out of granite, except...

17:56.242 --> 17:57.846
they do...

17:58.010 --> 17:59.956
the slishy-sloshy.

18:00.112 --> 18:03.184
When they walk,
they go slishy-sloshy...

18:03.683 --> 18:07.062
slishy... I see your eyes light up.
You bastard.

18:07.219 --> 18:10.962
Why don't you admit that you love
to look at ass and tits, okay?

18:11.123 --> 18:14.229
- What's wrong with you?
- Absolutely not.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.072
Boy, you such a bullshit artist.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.211
I got you. I got your ass this time.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.040
Yeah, all right. All right.

18:44.223 --> 18:47.067
Did you watch the Super Bowl game
where the Saints won?

18:47.226 --> 18:49.263
No, man, I didn't. I missed it.

18:49.428 --> 18:53.308
Damn, honey. That's like a fantasy
of mine come true.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.076
You know, you talk about
a fantasy story.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.146
I was at a bar in New Orleans...

18:58.304 --> 19:02.650
John Goodman comes up to me, starts
talking, asks me to go duck hunting.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.015
You know John Goodman. He was...

19:05.177 --> 19:07.680
- Yeah. Yep.
- ...Dan Conner in the Roseanne show.

19:07.847 --> 19:11.488
Who would have thought that
he would ask me to go duck hunting?

19:11.651 --> 19:14.495
Was there a spaceship
up above the bar...

19:14.654 --> 19:17.134
that was manipulating him?

19:17.790 --> 19:19.428
Who's to say that...

19:19.592 --> 19:22.129
there's not somebody out there...

19:22.294 --> 19:24.535
who's planning and playing us...

19:24.697 --> 19:27.041
like little dolls, you know?

19:27.199 --> 19:30.009
They're moving us around
like we're on a chessboard.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.705
You know, it's like
this is all science fiction.

19:32.872 --> 19:36.342
Reality, that we think about it,
doesn't exist.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.455
And you might not even be here.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.615
- I'm pretty sure I'm here.
- You don't know if you're here.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.785
You might be somewhere else.
You might be in a test tube...

19:44.950 --> 19:48.022
- I'm..
- You could be drifting around in space.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.668
He's, like, a little bit eccentric.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.997
- Okay.
- Just so you know.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.334
- Okay.
- Oh, boy. I think that's them.

19:57.496 --> 20:00.568
That's a ginormous car.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.974
- Is there a fire over there?
- What?

20:03.135 --> 20:05.513
A fire. You see-J?
ls there a fire over there?

20:05.671 --> 20:06.809
Where?

20:06.972 --> 20:10.681
Oh, I see you now.
It's your ass that's so hot, it's on fire.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.323
- Okay.
- Thank you, Leslie.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.925
Don't call me Leslie.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.823
Now hold it right there.

20:17.983 --> 20:19.656
- Walk a little bit closer.
- Okay.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.163
Let me take a couple pictures
of you girls.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.562
Hold it right there. Give us a big smile.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.599
Alrighty. Got it, girls.

20:30.596 --> 20:33.270
Didn't they have any big cars
available?

20:33.432 --> 20:35.708
Come here, doll baby.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.608
- Thanks for getting us.
- I'm so happy to see you.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.185
- Good to see you too.
- It's good to see you.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.117
- You too.
- And this is your friend?

20:45.277 --> 20:47.086
- Janet.
- Nice meeting you, Janet.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.192
- Hi.
- Hi, Janet.

20:49.348 --> 20:50.383
- Hi.
- Colin.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.187
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Ellen.

20:52.351 --> 20:53.557
Hi, Ellen.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.198
- Dr. Mitch.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:55.354 --> 20:57.960
- Janet has a question for you.
- Shoot, baby.

20:58.124 --> 21:01.799
It's a medical question.
Sorry, I'm sure it's annoying...

21:01.961 --> 21:05.534
to have people always bothering you
about questions like that.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.542
My friends and family do it to me
all the time. Go on.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.703
Okay, well, when we were taking off...

21:10.870 --> 21:14.613
I just felt like my heart skipped a beat
a couple times.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.754
Do you feel faint right now?

21:16.909 --> 21:18.650
No, I feel okay now.

21:18.811 --> 21:22.816
Well, you know, I've got my stethoscope
and blood pressure cuff in the room.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.792
We'll check out your ticker
when we get to the hotel.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.397
- Okay. All right, thanks.
- How's that?

21:28.554 --> 21:31.501
- Where the hell's y'all's luggage?
- They lost it.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.261
- Oh, shit.
- Lost it here?

21:33.425 --> 21:34.460
Oh, golly.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.072
They left it in Nuuk.

21:36.228 --> 21:38.265
Nuuk?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.668
Reminds me of a trip to Italy.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.075
They lost my luggage and,
boy, was that a...

21:44.236 --> 21:47.115
Well, your mama must have told you
about that trip.

21:47.273 --> 21:49.116
Damn, I thought she would.

21:49.275 --> 21:52.813
Well, let's hit the road, guys.
Rock and roll.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.787
Okay.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.927
Hold it.

22:01.353 --> 22:03.629
Okay, breathe.

22:04.123 --> 22:07.593
Your ticker's fine. Normal sinus rhythm,
no murmurs.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.795
Okay.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.999
What y'all doing?
Like two vultures looking down at me.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.770
You're messing up my bedside manner.
What's wrong?

22:14.934 --> 22:16.675
Fascinating to see you work, man.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.873
- For a change?
- Yeah, Leslie.

22:19.705 --> 22:23.881
Damn it, I don't know how many times
I'm gonna tell y'all not to call me Leslie.

22:24.043 --> 22:27.286
- But I can't call you Mitch.
- What if I called you Oscar?

22:27.446 --> 22:31.451
Well, if that was my God-given name,
then that would be fine.

22:31.617 --> 22:35.030
I don't think any god
would give you the name of Oscar.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.827
I'll call you Uncle L instead,
that's better.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.231
That's... Hell no, don't call me Uncle L.

22:40.392 --> 22:43.896
I'm not your uncle,
I'm your cousin once removed.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.373
But it's kind of uncle-ish.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.570
- No, it's not kind of uncle-ish.
- Kind of like an uncle.

22:49.735 --> 22:54.741
No, not like kind of like an uncle.
Not uncle-ish whatsoever, okay?

22:54.907 --> 22:56.352
Never an uncle.

22:56.508 --> 22:59.717
You know, she just does this
to aggravate me, you know?

22:59.879 --> 23:04.225
- We just fight like this all the time.
- That's not true. She's just being a turd.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.990
- Trying to get my goat, okay?
- Tea for the ladies.

23:08.153 --> 23:10.394
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.730
So you girls up for a big party,
going out to dinner tonight?

23:13.893 --> 23:16.999
We'll go out and splurge,
have the best dinner we can find.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.539
Sounds pretty good.

23:18.697 --> 23:20.768
I mean, a big night on the town.

23:20.933 --> 23:24.847
- Remember, I'm a vegetarian, right'?
- Oh, God, yes, I forgot about that.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.280
I'm sure at a fancy restaurant
like that...

23:27.439 --> 23:29.851
they'd have rabbit food
for you to gnaw on.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.784
- Okay.
- You're not a vegetarian?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.014
No, I eat meat.

23:33.178 --> 23:37.456
Thank God. I can tell with your
beautiful complexion, you know?

23:38.250 --> 23:42.289
I'm not gonna say anything about
that vegetarian complexion over there.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.798
If y'all got some better clothes
than that...

23:44.957 --> 23:47.904
something that's a little more,
you know, feminine.

23:48.060 --> 23:51.098
Little more showing stuff
and everything, or...?

23:51.263 --> 23:54.540
- Because this is gonna be a big night.
- Can we just wear this'?

23:54.700 --> 23:56.873
I think your outfit looks very matronly.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.312
I mean, it really does. It look matronly.

23:59.471 --> 24:03.977
And I think you both need...
You have some nicer clothes than this?

24:04.143 --> 24:06.248
- Sorry.
- Our luggage is gone.

24:06.412 --> 24:08.085
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

24:08.247 --> 24:11.091
I'm gonna give you
my gold Granite credit card.

24:11.250 --> 24:14.322
Y'all go out
and spend as much as you want to.

24:14.486 --> 24:16.625
If you wanna go get a manicure,
pedicure.

24:16.789 --> 24:22.137
It's all on me, anything you want.
But I want it to look nice, please.

24:22.294 --> 24:26.470
- You really don't need to do that.
- I know I don't need to, but I'm going to.

24:26.632 --> 24:30.739
Your mama helped me out a lot
when I was a kid.

24:30.903 --> 24:34.908
And I'm just... Payback.
This is like a karma situation.

24:35.074 --> 24:40.251
I'm not gonna take no for an answer. This
is my party, okay. Y'all are part of it.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.190
- Okay, thank...
- We got that settled?

24:43.349 --> 24:45.454
- Thank you. Sounds good.
- Thank you.

24:46.452 --> 24:48.955
Let's go and have a joint now.

24:50.255 --> 24:53.099
Kind of puts me a dark place.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.265
- You?
- No, thank you.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.111
Ain't happening.

25:04.269 --> 25:07.978
Three party poopers.
Boy, I can't believe this.

26:10.035 --> 26:12.743
You had to cause a scene
and be a pain the ass, huh'?

26:12.905 --> 26:15.010
I wasn't being a pain in the ass.

26:15.174 --> 26:18.451
What do you think they're gonna think,
we're pains in the ass?

26:18.610 --> 26:22.854
They're not gonna think we're pains
in the ass. I don't like two things.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.427
I don't think the waiter
was put off much.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.530
Probably won't spit in our food.

26:27.686 --> 26:31.634
- And by the way, y'all's clothes.
- What's wrong with our clothes?

26:31.790 --> 26:35.738
Looks like you bought
four or five T-shirts, cut them up...

26:35.894 --> 26:39.569
and stapled them together
to make your outfits, okay?

26:39.731 --> 26:44.578
So, Janet, sorry,
but you look like a damn toddler, okay?

26:44.736 --> 26:47.717
But you, lady, I can't believe you.

26:47.873 --> 26:51.116
Looks like that you got into
Janet Reno's closet.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.917
And the outfit you got on right now
looks like a lesbo tennis outfit.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.424
Perfect. That's what I like.

26:57.583 --> 27:01.463
When you got what you all have,
we got two good-looking women...

27:01.620 --> 27:03.622
you need to flaunt it, okay?

27:03.789 --> 27:06.167
You know, a sheer blouse.

27:06.325 --> 27:07.565
A short skirt.

27:07.726 --> 27:10.468
- High boots that show your legs.
- Okay.

27:10.629 --> 27:16.307
And use that frosty lip stuff
that looks so wonderful.

27:22.908 --> 27:26.651
So here we have the Friulano grape
from Friuli in northern Italy.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.588
It's a light, oaky taste, very fruity.

27:29.748 --> 27:31.955
With a smoky aftertaste.

27:32.117 --> 27:33.596
It's excellent, thank you.

27:33.752 --> 27:35.425
To a wonderful evening, ladies.

27:35.587 --> 27:36.827
Thank you so much.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.936
And I think you're dressed superbly.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.830
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.871
How long have you known each other?

27:44.029 --> 27:45.702
- It's about six years now.
- Yeah.

27:45.864 --> 27:46.934
From school?

27:47.099 --> 27:49.272
We're both PhD candidates
at Columbia...

27:49.434 --> 27:53.439
- but we're in different departments.
- PhD, wow.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.515
Okay, so, what are you studying?

27:55.674 --> 28:01.352
I'm studying northern native communities
and basically kind of focusing...

28:01.513 --> 28:06.292
on how climate change would affect
the, you know, their way of life.

28:06.451 --> 28:10.297
Anyway, Janet studies Jewish mysticism,
which is really fascinating.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.696
Jewish mysticism. Are you Jewish?

28:12.858 --> 28:14.064
No, I'm not Jewish.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.639
Shucks. I was gonna drain your brain
a little bit.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.208
- My son converted to Judaism...
- Okay.

28:20.365 --> 28:24.541
several years ago and I always wanted
to learn a little bit more about that.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.738
Yeah.

28:25.904 --> 28:29.681
But my daughter-in-law is kind of,
you know, she's kind of a pain...

28:29.841 --> 28:33.220
and I just didn't wanna
give her the satisfaction...

28:33.378 --> 28:36.325
- of me asking her to find out about it.
- Right, okay.

28:36.481 --> 28:39.325
All right, here we have baked
and marinated rutabaga...

28:39.484 --> 28:44.024
cheese foam, sweet and sour herbs
and a crispy millet.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.093
So why are you two in Iceland?

28:47.259 --> 28:49.865
Getting our groove back.

28:50.095 --> 28:52.735
- All right. Good.
- Back in the groove.

28:52.898 --> 28:56.107
- Get us back in the groove.
- Sure.

28:56.268 --> 29:00.683
My wife and I separated
and Mitch thought I needed cheering up.

29:00.839 --> 29:03.581
- That was his second wife.
- Okay.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.383
I'm gonna give you a little history,
Janet.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.287
We were married to sisters.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.724
I was married to Edith Ann.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.794
And he was married to Patricia.

29:13.952 --> 29:16.398
Edith Ann and I split,
we had our differences.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.728
I love Edith.

29:19.124 --> 29:22.594
We won't wanna go there, believe me.
You don't wanna go there.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.796
Okay.

29:23.962 --> 29:28.377
Anyway,
Pat no longer would allow Colin...

29:28.533 --> 29:31.707
to come out and play
with nasty, dirty Mitch.

29:31.870 --> 29:35.079
Okay? Kind of kept him locked
in the house.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.278
No, she didn't keep me
locked in the house.

29:38.910 --> 29:41.288
How did you and Patricia meet?

29:41.880 --> 29:45.487
I was in the symphony orchestra
and she was in the choir.

29:45.651 --> 29:49.121
He was great French horn player.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.961
Do you still play?

29:51.123 --> 29:52.830
No, no, I gave it up.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.462
Got a normal job at a bank.

29:59.431 --> 30:02.640
- I actually have to pee, do you wanna-f?
- Oh, sure.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.678
You girls don't fall in, now.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.681
I think Janet's probably got
the hotsies for you.

30:10.842 --> 30:13.948
They're probably in there
talking about you right now.

30:14.112 --> 30:18.288
That would make absolutely no sense
whatsoever.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.020
Why not?

30:20.619 --> 30:25.329
I just don't want to talk about
younger women. It's just depressing.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.167
- You know, I'm...
- May we clear you plates, gentlemen?

30:29.328 --> 30:31.137
- Thank you.
- Please.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.271
Go on.

30:40.138 --> 30:42.880
I know you're trying to cheer me up.

30:43.508 --> 30:48.651
But I wish you would stop
bringing this up and stop needling me.

30:48.814 --> 30:51.522
- I'm not needling you.
- Yes, you are.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.459
- No, I'm not.
- You're looking for an argument, mate.

30:54.619 --> 30:57.065
See, when you say "mate,"
I know you're pissed.

30:57.222 --> 30:59.498
That's the only time you...

31:05.530 --> 31:07.532
Didn't take you ladies very long.

31:07.699 --> 31:11.078
No. We're very impressive that way.

31:12.838 --> 31:15.011
I wanna know about Jewish mysticism.

31:15.173 --> 31:16.709
Oh, what do you wanna know?

31:16.875 --> 31:19.822
I wanna know how it differs
from regular Judaism.

31:19.978 --> 31:26.987
Okay, well, mysticism is focused
on directly experiencing God.

31:27.152 --> 31:31.430
And there's also this idea about...

31:31.590 --> 31:35.663
everything that you can observe
and understand about the world...

31:35.827 --> 31:38.535
is only a fraction of its real truth.

31:38.697 --> 31:43.339
So there's, like, a superficial reality
that's the one that you're familiar with.

31:43.502 --> 31:49.077
But then underneath that there's a divine
energy that's sort of, like, the real truth.

31:49.674 --> 31:52.280
Da Vinci Code. Yeah'?

31:52.444 --> 31:54.947
I mean, sort of.

31:55.113 --> 31:57.525
It's different, but it's the same...

31:57.682 --> 32:00.526
You can't write a thesis
on 'fire Ba Finer' Code.

32:00.685 --> 32:02.756
I'm sure someone has done that.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.594
- Spooky.
- Of course.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.758
It is pretty spooky, actually.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.634
It's put me in the mood to read
a lot of supernatural stories recently.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.275
Like?

32:12.964 --> 32:18.437
Well, this one, yeah, there's one
I read recently that's more for fun.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.810
It has nothing to do
with Jewish mysticism.

32:20.972 --> 32:24.442
So here I have a rosé from
Provence with a bit of a peppery bite.

32:25.043 --> 32:26.579
Bite of pepper.

32:27.145 --> 32:28.954
What happens in the story?

32:29.114 --> 32:31.958
- You want me to tell the whole thing?
- Yeah, go for it.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.119
The story's about these two travelers.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.893
And they're out on a moor
and they're starting to get lost.

32:38.056 --> 32:42.232
They don't know which way the village is.
They keep going over hill after hill.

32:42.394 --> 32:46.137
Keep thinking it'll be, you know,
after the next one, but it isn't.

32:46.298 --> 32:50.508
So just as they're getting worried they
might have to sleep out on the moor...

32:50.669 --> 32:53.115
they come to this beautiful old house.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.909
Creepy old house?

32:55.073 --> 32:57.178
Yeah, yeah, it was pretty creepy.

32:57.342 --> 33:01.119
And there's a young woman sitting
out front, she's having her tea.

33:01.279 --> 33:05.455
She invites them over. Once she finds
out that they're lost she invites them...

33:05.617 --> 33:08.154
- to stay the night with her.
- A threesome.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.598
Well, no, she invites them
to stay in one of her guestrooms.

33:12.757 --> 33:14.100
Okay.

33:14.259 --> 33:17.035
And so they're trying to get settled
and go to sleep.

33:17.195 --> 33:20.472
And then they start hearing
all these footsteps around them...

33:20.632 --> 33:23.374
but they can't really tell
where it's coming from.

33:23.535 --> 33:29.144
So then the one guy hears a yell,
and he goes out into the hallway...

33:29.307 --> 33:32.117
and sees the door to his friend's room
is open...

33:32.277 --> 33:36.783
and his bed is empty
and the sheets are thrown on the ﬂoor.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.723
So he runs downstairs.

33:38.884 --> 33:43.060
And he gets down there just in time
to see a servant closing this heavy door.

33:43.221 --> 33:47.533
All right, guys, so here we have
some hand-picked beetroots, walnuts...

33:47.692 --> 33:52.163
some smoked fresh cheese,
pickled red onions and radish sprouts.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.469
- Hope you enjoy.
- Thank you.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.840
All right, keep going, keep going.

33:57.002 --> 34:01.178
Okay, so the guy goes through the door
to find his friend...

34:01.339 --> 34:04.877
and they get lost
in this labyrinth of hallways...

34:05.043 --> 34:08.217
that are winding back and forth
and sloping up and down...

34:08.380 --> 34:11.224
so that they can't tell
where they are in the house.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.487
Then the walls are glowing.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.029
They're green and moist.

34:15.687 --> 34:18.860
Damp, like slime on the walls
or something?

34:19.024 --> 34:22.870
Yeah. So they eventually
find this group of other people...

34:23.027 --> 34:26.168
but all of their faces
have been eroded.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.675
So they're just completely smooth...

34:28.833 --> 34:31.780
and they can't speak.
They can only, like, murmur.

34:31.937 --> 34:35.009
So the guys figure out
that the house is alive...

34:35.172 --> 34:39.781
and what happened is this guy,
hundreds of years ago, died...

34:39.945 --> 34:43.688
and he grew a house out of his brain
essentially.

34:43.848 --> 34:46.123
So the house became like his body...

34:46.284 --> 34:49.128
that was sprouting
from the life left in his brain.

34:49.286 --> 34:50.357
- Right.
- Damn.

34:50.522 --> 34:53.799
And so for him to survive
he has to trap people in the house...

34:53.958 --> 34:57.031
and slowly digest them over time.

34:57.762 --> 34:58.900
So who was the woman?

34:59.064 --> 35:02.477
- The woman was his wife, but his wife...
- Was his wife?

35:02.634 --> 35:06.377
Yeah, well,
she's actually part of him now.

35:06.538 --> 35:09.451
- God.
Because at some point he digested her.

35:09.608 --> 35:13.715
- Oh, God.
- So that she could become part of him.

35:13.878 --> 35:16.984
And lure in people.

35:17.148 --> 35:19.822
At then at the end
the two guys do find this guy...

35:19.985 --> 35:22.226
and they smash his head with a rock.

35:26.658 --> 35:29.639
You know, Colin,
you kind of remind me of my dad.

35:29.794 --> 35:30.829
Really?

35:30.996 --> 35:35.103
- Oh, yeah, I can see that.
- Least you didn't say granddad.

35:35.266 --> 35:37.405
Great-granddad.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.810
Yeah, I mean, I didn't mean it like that.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.917
Don't worry. I was just kidding.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.485
I'm not sensitive about my age.

36:41.232 --> 36:44.805
You know, we're the oldest people in here.
By a lot.

36:44.969 --> 36:46.346
What?

36:46.504 --> 36:50.077
I took a look around and I think
we're the oldest people in here.

36:50.241 --> 36:53.814
Another guy, he's about 45.
There's nobody else.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.389
Still can't hear you.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.582
Forget it.

37:12.397 --> 37:15.071
Long time
since I've been anywhere like that, mate.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.577
It's kind of invigorating,
don't you think?

37:17.736 --> 37:20.046
- You think so?
- I think so.

37:20.205 --> 37:23.186
- You're in a bad mood still?
- No, I'm not in a bad mood.

37:23.341 --> 37:25.617
- I'm in a great mood.
- You're in a bad mood.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.189
- Yeah, sure.
- I'm always in a good mood.

37:28.346 --> 37:31.190
- Good. Good for you.
- Come on, come on, come on.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.559
Americans.

37:37.722 --> 37:40.100
No, bloody Australian.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.862
You are American.

37:42.026 --> 37:43.471
- You are Australian.
- Yes.

37:43.628 --> 37:44.698
- Yes.
- Correct.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.901
- What are you guys doing? You look old.
- Cheers, man.

37:48.066 --> 37:51.047
- You look dusty.
- We came with a couple young ladies.

37:51.202 --> 37:55.207
You look like Rolling Stones
in, like, 30 years.

37:55.373 --> 37:58.547
I can see it on your face,
you've been smoking a lot of weed.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.712
And you gotta light me up right now.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.381
- I can do that.
- You have to.

38:02.547 --> 38:05.551
Looks like you're already lit,
but I'll light you anyway.

38:05.717 --> 38:06.787
Yeah, I need it.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.157
There you go.

38:08.319 --> 38:11.493
We need to get trippy
before we light up these glow sticks.

38:11.656 --> 38:14.432
- What's a glow stick?
- This is a glow stick.

38:14.592 --> 38:17.835
- What the hell is this?
- You do it like this. You break it.

38:17.996 --> 38:21.500
- All right, yeah.
- You wave it around, put it in your beer.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.771
Oh, my goodness, that is so...

38:23.935 --> 38:27.473
- Another one, another one, another one.
- Glow in the dark beer.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.448
- That's really cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:29.607 --> 38:31.780
- It's a good thing.
- Cheer, cheer, cheers.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.320
- Want a drink of that?
- No.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.651
Hey, guys? Guys, I need your help.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.818
Ellen got really drunk.
She's passed out in the bathroom.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.018
Oh, shit.

38:41.619 --> 38:46.796
Well, it's settled. You girls are gonna
be bunking in one of our rooms tonight.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.632
- Colin and I can bunk in the other room.
- No.

38:49.794 --> 38:53.173
- No, you don't have to do that.
- I know we don't have to do that.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.709
- We'll just stop here.
- It's already decided.

38:55.867 --> 38:59.144
- Look at this.
- We can't carry your ass all the way.

38:59.304 --> 39:03.684
Put on your big-girl panties
so we can get on back to the hotel.

39:03.842 --> 39:07.346
Damn, there goes that tickle-box again.

39:08.112 --> 39:12.026
- Come on.
Sometimes I just walk home like this.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.561
Yeah, looks like you're walking on air,
you know?

39:14.719 --> 39:17.495
Air you going my Way?

39:19.557 --> 39:23.630
Careful. Don't forget
your big-girl panties now.

39:23.795 --> 39:26.298
- Where's Colin?
- We're going home right now.

39:26.798 --> 39:30.302
- Is he putting on his big-girl panties?
- Come on, now.

39:30.468 --> 39:33.540
This is not funny at all, okay?

39:34.038 --> 39:37.815
- Let's get gorditas. I'm gonna be sick.
- We'll be there before daylight.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.013
Where's Colin Lansky at anyway?

39:41.512 --> 39:44.823
- We're here.
- Yeah, we made it.

39:50.255 --> 39:51.928
I'm sorry, Mitch.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.037
- Nothing to be sorry for.
- I ruined our big night.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.605
No, you didn't ruin anything.

39:57.762 --> 39:59.503
You didn't ruin anything.

39:59.664 --> 40:03.510
Tell Colin I said sorry.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.711
It's okay.

40:09.440 --> 40:15.618
Thank you for picking me up
and taking me home.

40:15.780 --> 40:18.056
You're welcome, but it's okay.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.355
- Just try to rest.
- Okay.

40:20.518 --> 40:23.124
- Mitch?
- Yeah, baby.

40:23.855 --> 40:26.529
I'm sorry you had to retire.

40:26.691 --> 40:28.637
What do you mean?

40:28.793 --> 40:31.637
My mom said you...
They made you retire.

40:31.796 --> 40:34.276
No, I just retired on my own.

40:34.432 --> 40:38.244
Just don't worry about it,
and you get some rest, okay?

40:43.408 --> 40:45.615
Sweet dreams, doll.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.558
Janet, she's crashed and burned.

40:52.717 --> 40:54.628
Okay.

40:55.119 --> 40:58.498
- Colin, you got everything you need?
- Yeah, I've got it.

41:07.498 --> 41:09.068
Mitch?

41:10.501 --> 41:12.674
Are you awake?

41:13.071 --> 41:17.315
Yeah, I can't saw a toothpick
let alone a log.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.984
You want to see what's on television?

41:26.150 --> 41:30.098
This will probably help you
sleep a lot, boy.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.335
God.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.269
Jesus.

41:44.769 --> 41:47.375
You are such a child.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.890
Help me.

42:26.411 --> 42:28.220
Bye, girls.

42:45.730 --> 42:48.210
Boy, it feels great
to be out of the city, huh?

42:48.366 --> 42:50.778
Yeah, into the wild.

42:50.935 --> 42:53.745
Yeah, but, you know,
it's not really wild yet.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.111
They got roads here.

42:55.273 --> 42:59.949
When we get out where there's no roads,
that's where it's gonna be. That's wild.

43:00.111 --> 43:01.852
Wanna hear about Gullfoss?

43:02.013 --> 43:03.788
Sure.

43:03.948 --> 43:05.621
Alrighty.

43:08.286 --> 43:10.698
"Iceland's most famous waterfall.

43:10.855 --> 43:13.859
Gullfoss is a spectacular double cascade.

43:14.292 --> 43:17.796
Whether or not you're suitable impressed
can depend on the weather.

43:17.962 --> 43:20.943
On sunny days,
the spray creates shimmering rainbows...

43:21.099 --> 43:25.741
and it's also magical in winter
when the falls glitter with ice.

43:25.903 --> 43:31.114
On gray days,
mist can envelop the second drop...

43:31.275 --> 43:34.484
making Gullfoss
slightly underwhelming."

43:34.645 --> 43:38.491
I know I'm not gonna be underwhelmed.
I'm gonna be overwhelmed.

43:38.649 --> 43:41.721
It's gonna be so much fun there.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.622
What else we got going on?

43:43.788 --> 43:47.133
- We got the geysers.
- Oh, shit, man, the geysers.

43:47.291 --> 43:48.463
My favorite.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.470
- Yeah, I love geysers.
- I've never seen a geyser, man.

43:51.629 --> 43:55.634
Really? I've seen a few of them
and, man, they're so much fun.

43:55.800 --> 43:59.407
You just watch them. You know,
it's just like this big explosion.

43:59.570 --> 44:02.278
Like a big cum shot right straight up
into the sky.

44:02.440 --> 44:05.649
You know, like the devil's exploding.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.790
Okay.

44:07.945 --> 44:09.686
What else?

44:12.283 --> 44:14.354
I'm almost afraid to say.

44:14.519 --> 44:16.590
I wanna see a lighthouse.

44:16.754 --> 44:19.257
A lighthouse?
I've seen millions of lighthouses.

44:19.423 --> 44:22.267
But you haven't seen
an Icelandic lighthouse, have you?

44:22.426 --> 44:24.667
No. No, I haven't.

44:24.829 --> 44:26.331
Good.

44:27.031 --> 44:31.309
Lighthouses remind me...

44:31.469 --> 44:37.112
of rock hard cocks with no balls.

44:49.020 --> 44:52.661
Come on, Colin,
give me some good ones, baby.

44:52.823 --> 44:55.360
What if I lean on it?

44:55.526 --> 44:58.405
That's wonderful.
Lean on the sun of a gun.

44:58.563 --> 45:00.201
All right, hold on, now.

45:00.364 --> 45:04.073
Now put your other leg over
just a little bit more over that way.

45:04.235 --> 45:09.412
Move your hand back up to the left.
Okay, over a bit more to your left.

45:09.574 --> 45:12.646
Right there. Hold it. Perfect. Go.

45:12.810 --> 45:16.417
All right, that's wonderful.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.152
Geometrically perfect.

45:19.317 --> 45:21.558
Hey, ass shot. Dumb & Dumber.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.665
All right.

45:23.821 --> 45:25.698
Wiggle it down there, baby. Wiggle.

45:25.856 --> 45:27.767
Shake it down there. Shake it.

45:27.925 --> 45:29.495
Yeah, there you go.

45:34.265 --> 45:38.372
You're looking very nice down there,
baby, yeah.

45:38.536 --> 45:41.278
Hey, your best side, darling.

45:41.439 --> 45:43.680
Good. Oh, no, that's great.

45:43.841 --> 45:45.946
Somebody stop me.
- Hold it right here.

45:46.110 --> 45:47.180
I got it.

46:15.039 --> 46:18.316
Have you seen
The Last of the Mohicans?

46:18.476 --> 46:19.716
What?

46:19.877 --> 46:25.156
I said, have you seen
The Last of the Mohicans?

46:25.316 --> 46:27.887
You think we can sleep in this thing?

46:28.052 --> 46:29.122
Sleep in it?

46:29.287 --> 46:30.925
Why would you wanna know?

46:31.088 --> 46:33.762
I mean, if we had to,
we could do it for one night.

46:33.924 --> 46:37.565
Just lay back. It's almost like
we got a house on wheels.

46:37.728 --> 46:41.073
Like camping out like when I was a kid.

46:41.232 --> 46:43.610
I can't see you as a kid, you know?

46:43.768 --> 46:47.079
Well, I know I can't see you as a kid.

46:47.805 --> 46:51.947
I always thought
you were just like there, right?

46:54.745 --> 46:56.782
You on Facebook?

46:56.947 --> 46:58.858
No, how about you?

47:00.184 --> 47:01.686
Yeah, I opened an account...

47:01.852 --> 47:04.594
- when Katie split up with me.
- Yeah.

47:04.755 --> 47:07.497
I thought it would be a good way
to be more social.

47:07.658 --> 47:11.606
You know, all my kids are on Facebook.
They have a good time. They like it.

47:11.762 --> 47:13.708
Yeah, mine is too.

47:13.864 --> 47:16.811
Well, did it really help your social life?

47:16.967 --> 47:19.641
Well, yes and no.

47:20.471 --> 47:23.213
I connected with some friends
in Australia.

47:23.374 --> 47:27.186
And then I found out that Katie
was on Facebook as well.

47:27.645 --> 47:28.817
What did you find out?

47:28.979 --> 47:31.823
Well, she had her settings
kind of private.

47:31.982 --> 47:34.690
Then I found her boyfriend's page.

47:35.619 --> 47:38.225
And there were photos there
of them together...

47:38.389 --> 47:42.030
- and, you know, holding hands...
- Yeah.

47:42.193 --> 47:46.164
and walking off
into my fucking sunset.

47:46.330 --> 47:49.971
What in the hell really happened
between you and Katie anyway?

47:50.134 --> 47:53.138
- Well, we opened a shoe business.
- And?

47:53.304 --> 47:57.753
She had a shoe designer friend
and they opened a storefront.

47:57.908 --> 48:01.583
People would log in,
vote for the shoes they wanted...

48:01.746 --> 48:04.249
and then they would make the shoes...

48:04.415 --> 48:06.554
depending on what led the requests.

48:06.717 --> 48:09.095
That sounds like a bullshit gimmick
to me.

48:09.253 --> 48:13.565
Yeah, well, it sucked a big one, man,
because it went broke.

48:13.724 --> 48:17.035
And I'm a...
I put a lot of my money into that.

48:17.194 --> 48:19.902
- Pretty much my whole savings.
- Right.

48:20.064 --> 48:22.874
And then Katie gets on my back...

48:23.033 --> 48:26.742
because I wasn't
behind it enough "spiritually."

48:26.904 --> 48:30.078
- Oh, spiritually.
- Yeah, thank you very much.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.584
I could not believe her.

48:31.742 --> 48:35.884
Well, some women you just can't make
happy no matter what you do, you know?

48:36.046 --> 48:39.220
I don't want much.
Someone to talk the news over with.

48:39.383 --> 48:42.592
Someone to have breakfast with,
have a cup of tea.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.960
Sleep with at night.

48:45.456 --> 48:47.959
It can't be that difficult, can it?

48:48.125 --> 48:50.401
I don't know.

48:57.968 --> 49:00.812
Yeah, Strokkur, he's conjuring.

49:00.971 --> 49:03.281
- Do you want some accompaniment?
- Yeah.

49:03.441 --> 49:06.320
Give me a little background music there,
will you?

49:16.954 --> 49:19.093
- Nothing's happening.
- Come on, Strokkur.

49:19.256 --> 49:23.671
- Why are you dancing? You that excited?
- I'm excited about this. You kidding me?

49:23.828 --> 49:26.138
- Gonna wet your pants?
- No.

49:26.297 --> 49:29.608
I've already gotten my pants wet.
Come on, Streak.

49:31.135 --> 49:33.809
Come on, stroke it out of there.

49:37.241 --> 49:41.656
All right, here we go.
Hey, abra-cadabra.

49:41.812 --> 49:45.760
You're gonna make me cry. Hurry up.
Get on out of there. Come on.

49:45.916 --> 49:47.987
Somethings...

49:48.152 --> 49:49.597
There he is.

49:49.753 --> 49:51.755
All right.

49:55.960 --> 49:58.270
How about that, Mother Rue?

49:58.429 --> 50:00.534
You got that one?
How good did that feel?

50:00.698 --> 50:03.008
- That's fantastic.
- Are you smiling?

50:03.167 --> 50:04.840
I can't see jack crap, man.

50:05.002 --> 50:07.209
Hold on. Windshield wipers.

50:07.371 --> 50:10.215
God, I can't see nothing.
Here, take my camera.

50:10.374 --> 50:12.183
All right. We got another one.

50:12.343 --> 50:16.450
All right.

50:17.047 --> 50:19.721
What do you think about that mother?

50:21.318 --> 50:22.820
That is unbelievable.

50:22.987 --> 50:26.366
- Now tell me you're not having fun.
- Yeah.

50:28.993 --> 50:31.337
We did it.

50:31.829 --> 50:34.173
Let's go for three. Number three.

50:34.331 --> 50:36.675
- We want number three.
- Yes, yes, yes.

53:29.239 --> 53:31.742
Hey. Honey, how you doing?

53:31.909 --> 53:33.820
Oh, jeez.

53:34.545 --> 53:35.853
Sweetheart

53:36.013 --> 53:38.254
Oh, you're gorgeous.

53:41.418 --> 53:43.489
When did you retire?

53:46.323 --> 53:48.098
Ellen said you retired.

53:48.258 --> 53:52.172
- Yeah, about a month ago.
- Yeah, how come?

53:52.329 --> 53:54.002
Times change, people change.

53:54.164 --> 53:57.111
What about you, asshole?
Why did you retire?

53:57.267 --> 53:59.941
I retired because I could.

54:00.104 --> 54:04.348
Now I'm looking at going back to work,
but I don't want to go back to work.

54:09.713 --> 54:12.023
Come on, let's take a walk.

54:14.284 --> 54:15.729
Let's take a walk.

54:15.886 --> 54:17.297
It's dark, mate.

54:17.454 --> 54:20.025
Yeah, but I've got the lightning sticks.
Come on.

54:22.392 --> 54:25.737
- Yeah, what do I do with that?
- You crack it.

54:25.896 --> 54:28.069
- Crack it?
- And it glows.

54:28.232 --> 54:29.575
You can't see with those.

54:29.733 --> 54:32.441
I was in the Marine Corps.
Come on, get your ass up.

54:32.603 --> 54:36.141
Do they use glow sticks
in the Marine Corps, Mitch?

54:38.142 --> 54:39.212
No.

54:44.815 --> 54:46.294
- Mitch?
- Yeah?

54:46.450 --> 54:49.795
- I can't see anything.
- You can see me. That's all that matters.

54:49.953 --> 54:52.763
Oh, God. Yeah, that's a bonus.

55:00.931 --> 55:02.001
Wait a minute.

55:02.166 --> 55:04.009
- Did you hear that?
- What? What?

55:04.168 --> 55:05.738
Listen.

55:07.938 --> 55:11.010
Oh, it's one of those bears
that might come eat your ass.

55:11.175 --> 55:13.177
There's no bears in Iceland, Mitch.

55:13.343 --> 55:16.620
Polar bears ﬂoat in on icebergs here
all the time, boy.

55:16.780 --> 55:18.817
Yeah, okay.

55:25.189 --> 55:27.430
Oh, God.

55:30.994 --> 55:34.271
- What did you step in?
- Oh, God. I don't know.

55:34.431 --> 55:37.969
Let's go up here to the top
of this little mountain here. This hill.

55:38.135 --> 55:40.445
- What hill?
- This little hill right up here.

55:40.604 --> 55:42.777
- You can see a hill?
- Yeah, right up here.

55:42.940 --> 55:47.548
- Yeah, you who can't see at night.
- Get up here so we can get a better view.

55:47.711 --> 55:50.351
- Man, this is an adventure.
- You can't see a hill.

55:50.514 --> 55:52.687
We can see the...

55:52.850 --> 55:55.626
- Yeah, it's probably a cliff.
- Yeah, but... Come on.

55:55.786 --> 55:57.788
Come on, Mitch.

56:00.457 --> 56:03.370
- I think we're off the path, Colin.
- Great.

56:03.527 --> 56:06.508
Where do you think the path is?

56:10.834 --> 56:13.678
I don't know. I don't know.

56:17.241 --> 56:20.188
We've lost track of the hotel for a while.

56:20.344 --> 56:22.654
You know, this reminds me...

56:22.813 --> 56:27.387
when I was fox hunting
with my grandpa back in Kentucky.

56:27.551 --> 56:31.863
I had to go to the bathroom and I wasn't
gonna take a crap out there in the woods.

56:32.022 --> 56:36.664
And I got lost for three or four hours
trying to make it back to grandpa's house.

56:36.827 --> 56:40.001
- Really.
- That's encouraging.

56:40.163 --> 56:43.667
- Which way do you think we should go?
- You're leading. You tell me.

56:43.834 --> 56:46.610
This is like one of those horror movies.

56:46.770 --> 56:49.080
Out here in the middle of nowhere,
you know?

56:49.239 --> 56:53.881
I don't know why I listen to a word
you say, Mitch, because it's all bullshit.

56:54.044 --> 56:56.285
Why do we have to be out here?

56:56.446 --> 56:59.950
- Why do we have to stumble in the dark?
- We're having an adventure.

57:00.117 --> 57:01.528
Yeah, but you went for it.

57:01.685 --> 57:06.031
Yeah, that's because you won't take no
for an answer.

57:06.189 --> 57:08.294
All right? It always has to be your way.

57:08.458 --> 57:10.961
I'm Mitch. I'm the fucking Marine.

57:11.128 --> 57:14.541
Remind me. Next time I'll bring
somebody else with me to Iceland.

57:14.698 --> 57:18.202
Yeah? You got some other ex-relations
that you can bamboozle?

57:18.368 --> 57:20.814
- Oh, yeah.
- Why are you always on the move?

57:20.971 --> 57:22.973
Why don't you just stop? Stay still.

57:23.140 --> 57:26.280
- Don't you ever just wanna sit?
- Life is too fucking short.

57:26.443 --> 57:29.652
- And look out the window.
- Life is too short to sit still.

57:29.813 --> 57:34.262
Yeah, I want the rest of my life to be more
relaxed than this experience, all right?

57:34.418 --> 57:35.920
I'll get you a rocking chair.

57:36.086 --> 57:38.396
- You can sit on your porch.
- Fuck it, Mitch.

58:00.344 --> 58:01.846
Wake up.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.460
Damn, I was just getting comfortable.

58:05.615 --> 58:08.653
It's light enough to make our way back.

58:08.819 --> 58:10.924
You know which way it is?

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.963
I heard y'all talking...

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.936
- and are y'all from the States?
- Yeah.

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:33.938
Hey, how about that. Me too.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:37.010
So, what y'all doing here, anyway?

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.113
We're actually on our honeymoon.

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:42.182
- Moon! Oh, honeymoon.
- Yeah.

01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:44.819
So how long y'all been married?

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.784
- It's day four.
- Couple days, yeah.

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.513
- Four days?
- Yeah.

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:51.090
Four days, that's wonderful.

01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:55.822
The advice that my grandpa gave me,
I'll give y'all.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:57.158
Just remember:

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.462
Don't let the sun rise or set
on a problem that you have...

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:04.367
and you'll do right by yourselves.

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:06.005
What y'all been doing here?

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:09.269
- We haven't done that much yet.
- Been staying in your room?

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.840
- Yeah.
- Little bit.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:15.779
How many times have you hit the mat
in the last four days'?

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.817
Oh, no comment?

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:43.366
Believe it or not, I spent my honeymoon
at Walt Disney World.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:44.876
Can you imagine that?

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.572
Oh, is that a bunch of crap, huh? Yeah.

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:50.047
But guess what, that's what we did.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.155
Now, are y'all gonna have kids, now?
How old are y'all anyway?

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:59.259
Well, now, hold on a minute.
Let me guess, okay?

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:03.998
This gorgeous young thing over here
with that beautiful skin, beautiful face...

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:07.031
I say she's 21.

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:12.734
And for you, I'm gonna go 26.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:15.934
Was that...?
How close? Was I right?

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:19.107
- No.
- I'm 35, she's 30.

01:02:19.336 --> 01:02:20.610
Are you kidding me?

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:24.115
That gorgeous thing looks like
she just stepped out of a cradle.

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:28.086
She is so young. I figured
they might be gonna put you in jail.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:32.057
If you were 35, they could
put you in jail for that, you know.

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:34.695
- I don't know about that.
Because she looks...

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:36.797
a lot younger than 30.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.931
One little thing I wanna tell you...

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:42.536
and I don't want her to hear,
so I'll whisper it in your ear.

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:45.229
Here, just a sec, okay?

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:48.107
Just remember:

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:53.408
She's always, always right.
Never wrong.

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:57.480
No matter what she says, you say,
"Yes, ma'am. You're right."

01:02:57.641 --> 01:03:00.417
Just keep on that right track,
and you'll be okay.

01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:01.578
- Got it?
- Yeah.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.626
Pleasure, pleasure of life.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:15.395
Maybe we'll do breakfast in the morning.
How's that sound?

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:18.300
- Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah. Maybe in the morning.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.065
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:05.842
Mitch!

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:07.504
- God!
- I'm sorry.

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:09.946
I knocked on the door,
you didn't answer.

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:12.347
- I needed to talk to you.
- What time is it?

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:13.852
Oh, it's really late.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:18.425
For Pete's sake, it's really late.
It's really late.

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:22.856
When I'm freaking out, man,
I need to talk to you.

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:25.727
Between us get hung
out there in that field...

01:05:25.889 --> 01:05:28.563
and Janet's story
she told us the other night...

01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:32.070
this place reminds me
of a ghoulish place, you know?

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:34.799
- Just, just chill.
- Freaking out. Really freaking.

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:37.205
- Freaking. Freaking!
- Jesus.

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:39.074
- I'm freaking.
- God.

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:41.806
Just need somebody to talk to.

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:44.713
It's okay. I've forgiven you.

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:47.912
Everything's fine. You're a grown man.

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:49.249
I'm going to bed.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:50.823
- All right?
- Now, hold it.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.392
Stay up just a little bit. Come on.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:55.325
Chat with me. Please.

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:57.055
Please.

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:05.065
Do you have any pot with you?

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:08.136
- Do I have any pot with me?
- Do you?

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:11.245
- Well, let's...
- You know I always have pot with me.

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:13.642
- I thought it was a stupid question.
- Yeah.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:16.511
How about we have some. All right?

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:20.246
I tell you what, you mentioning that
almost makes me cry.

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:22.150
Thank you.

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.320
Okay.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.792
Does this bring back any memories,
you turd?

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:33.534
A buddy and I...

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.863
we were smoking this stuff...

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.165
and we were outside
shooting wine casks with a shotgun.

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:44.539
Then the guy with the shotgun saw a rat
climbing up the wall of the house.

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:48.182
- Was it a real rat?
- It was a real rat.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.715
Okay.

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:52.649
I thought it might've been you
climbing up the wall.

01:06:52.809 --> 01:06:55.551
It was the most amazing thing, honestly.

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:56.779
Was just...

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:59.893
And I remember flying home that night.

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.960
Flying home? Oh, cool.

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:04.394
- Yep.
- With no airplane, right?

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:06.157
That figures, you know.

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:10.668
There was no airplane, but I remember
definitely drifting above the road.

01:07:10.827 --> 01:07:12.238
It was really good stuff.

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.568
This kind, you were just elevating, huh?

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:17.177
Levitating? Cool.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:19.543
I like that feeling.

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:23.184
- I like that up, and going... How is it?
- Oh, man.

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:25.543
- Delicious?
- Exquisite.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:26.743
Hey, good.

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.914
- You always buy good stuff.
- Ought to be, it's expensive.

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.922
But it's good Icelandic stuff, man.

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:36.597
Turn the lights off when you leave.

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:39.495
Hey, you're not gonna go to sleep
on me, huh?

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:42.894
All right, go ahead.
I'll hang around for a while.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.902
- Yeah, why don't you.
- Okay.

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:46.768
And just so I won't be...

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:50.036
So I won't be lonesome,
I'll make sure nobody bothers you.

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:52.873
- Okay?
- Okay. Tell you what.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:57.274
Do whatever you want, Mitch.
It's... You're cool, man.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.011
- We try.
- Thank you very much.

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:03.749
- This is what it's all about.
- Elvis has left the building.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:09.094
Elvis is levitating out of the building.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:12.233
Right on up through the roof.

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:18.131
God, that stuff is strong.

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:20.729
Sure is.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:26.807
Just cruising, baby. Just cruising.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.256
Know what we need
to liven up this trip?

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:23.198
Let's start off by naming
our five favorite celebrity females...

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:26.203
that we'd like to have sex with.
I'll start off.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:28.841
Number one: Demi Moore.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:30.533
Her hips.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.510
Julia Roberts, her lips, is number two.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:37.174
Number three:
Everything about Halle Berry.

01:09:37.372 --> 01:09:40.046
- Number four: Jenna Elf man.
- All right, all right.

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:42.120
- Her long, long legs.
- All right.

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:45.054
You know what? I don't like lists.

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:47.854
That's what they do on Facebook.
Rank everything.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.496
Just leave it alone.

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:53.794
And I really,
really question Julia Roberts. Totally.

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:58.166
She was great in Pretty Woman, man.
She did it for free, she did it for money.

01:09:58.327 --> 01:10:01.069
And then she found love.
That's what it's all about.

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:04.244
- Yeah, that's Hollywood.
- Hollywood.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.813
My Aunt Jenny used to make lists
of everything like that.

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:12.180
Her recipes, her favorite movies,
her movie stars...

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:14.343
all those kind of things, you know?

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.649
Did she make a "favorite nephews" list?

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:18.656
Oh, come on, you horse's ass.

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:19.850
I know she loved me.

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:23.327
Because, you know, we played tennis
two or three times a week.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:28.062
- Do you ever watch any tennis?
- No, not much.

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:30.602
Well, there was this guy named Nadal.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.899
He's a professional player.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.166
Spanish guy.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.867
Good-looking guy,
that's why the broads like him.

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:39.411
I like him
because he's a good tennis player.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:43.915
But he's got this damn bad habit,
which has become a trademark...

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.576
where he's all the time
digging in his ass...

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:49.747
like he's got goats in his garden.

01:10:51.214 --> 01:10:52.454
Picking his wedgie.

01:10:52.682 --> 01:10:55.424
Picking his wedgie. Picking his wedgie.

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:03.966
Damn, that looks like
the Mississippi River, buddy.

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:19.885
- Oh, bay.
- Can't really see how deep it is...

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.953
- out there in the middle.
- Yeah.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.320
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:31.054
You think this thing will make it through
that deep water or not'!

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.961
Well, it's built for it, man.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.465
- I think.
- Yeah.

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:38.298
How about if we wade out in the middle
and see how deep it is?

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:40.099
You think?

01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:41.640
I'll do it. All right?

01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:45.468
You get the car nice and toasty,
and I will do it.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:49.173
- All right, boy, you got it.
- All right.

01:12:15.298 --> 01:12:19.769
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness.

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:26.543
I thought you was gonna get a shower
out there.

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:28.382
Shut up.

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:29.989
That solves that problem.

01:12:30.146 --> 01:12:32.183
Yeah.

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:37.028
Right-o.

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.734
Oh, here we go again.

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:52.573
- Yeah, it's just water.
- Hey!

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.715
Oh, yeah.

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:09.827
- Just like the old days, buddy.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.207
Hey, there.

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.408
- Hey, there, neighbor.
- Howdy, neighbor.

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:06.211
- Mitch.
- Nadine.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:07.911
Nice meeting you, Nadine.

01:14:08.077 --> 01:14:09.454
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.614
- Colin. Good to meet you.
- Hi, Colin.

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.159
- Yeah, nice meeting you too.
- You're American?

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:16.058
No, I'm Canadian, thank you.

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:19.062
Hey, John Candy,
my favorite Canadian.

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:21.326
- What province?
- That's... Good actor.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:22.798
I'm from Ontario.

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:23.993
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.071
- Nice.
- Yeah. Beautiful.

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:27.502
- You hiking?
- Yeah.

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.904
I'm hiking.
Came on vacation to just do...

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:33.912
You know,
take pictures and just check things out.

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:35.805
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.612
Okay. Well, I'm gonna head off.

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:41.316
And I will see you guys later.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.787
We'll catch you later.
Maybe have a drink...

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:45.289
- or a smoke.
- Okay.

01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:48.588
- Sounds like a good plan.
- Be safe.

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:51.095
Wonder if she knows
what you mean by "smoke."

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:56.369
I got a big surprise for you, buddy.

01:14:56.525 --> 01:15:00.302
- I got a big surprise for you, buddy.
- You got a surprise for me?

01:15:00.463 --> 01:15:03.034
- I have a surprise for you.
- What's your surprise?

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:07.511
- I'm not telling you. You tell me yours.
- No, you tell me yours first.

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:10.781
- Where are we?
- Iceland.

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:14.981
What can you buy in Iceland
you can't buy in the U.S.?

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:18.692
I don't know.

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:21.459
I don't know.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:22.685
Cuban cigars.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.833
- Cuban cigars.
- Yes.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:28.068
What's your surprise?

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:54.986
Way to go.

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:57.927
- Pretty good.
- Oh, yeah.

01:15:58.087 --> 01:16:00.567
- Oh, look at that.
- That'll do.

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.533
- Your favorite, baby.
- I'm gonna grab these.

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:07.504
- Careful. Don't burn yourself.
- No, I'll be fine.

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:21.514
I got something I need to tell you...

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:25.022
and I hope you won't hold it against me.

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:27.625
Hope you don't think any less of me.

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:29.854
But I gotta get it off my chest.

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:33.694
Truth is, I been retired for six months.

01:16:34.857 --> 01:16:36.234
Really?

01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:38.599
Yeah. Six months.

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:41.035
What happened, man?

01:16:41.197 --> 01:16:42.938
Well...

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.374
the short version...

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:49.241
is I actually had two choices.

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:51.978
I could get fired...

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:58.049
or take the retirement plan...

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:00.922
which is being put out to pasture.

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:09.330
And I chose put out to pasture,
so they gave me a good retirement deal.

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:15.469
But you know how I am.
I worked my whole life, you know.

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:18.635
Always had something to do.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.781
Now I don't have a shitting thing to do.

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:25.351
And I realized...

01:17:29.078 --> 01:17:32.457
that, hell, this damn trip is for me.

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:38.657
And I hope you'll forgive me
for lying to you...

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:42.699
and keeping these things from you...

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:46.271
and actually tricking you
into coming on this trip, you know'?

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:49.772
It's a pretty lousy thing to do.
Really, Mitch.

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:52.312
- I know.
- Buy tickets to Iceland...

01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:54.948
drive through the country,
stay at hotels...

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:58.381
eat good food,
I mean, that is really low.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.482
Man. We're still alive, eh?

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:07.290
I'm not dead yet.

01:18:08.951 --> 01:18:09.952
Not dead yet.

01:19:12.715 --> 01:19:15.025
Steve McQueen.
That's a Steve McQueen movie.

01:19:15.184 --> 01:19:16.720
Yeah, that's what it was.

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:20.389
Nadine, you sure this wouldn't be better
with, like, us not here...

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:23.059
and just the mountain
and the stream, and...?

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:26.570
Believe me, you guys make the shot.

01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:29.900
Just don't pay attention to me.

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.408
Just keep relaxing.

01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:35.140
Speaking of shot, it'd be nice
to have a couple of shots right now.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:37.214
- She's worked us out.
- Yeah, I know.

01:19:37.373 --> 01:19:38.545
Okay, look at me.

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:40.948
- I got you.
- Oh, come on. That was perfect.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:44.284
- All right, you like that, huh?
- You're not getting it.

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:49.559
- Great.
Hey, you think this picture's gonna...

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:54.667
When we go to Paris, this picture's gonna
be in a prominent place in the Louvre?

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:59.499
Okay? Or you think it's gonna be
in a fold-out on Playgirl magazine, baby?

01:19:59.662 --> 01:20:03.075
You're gonna be
right next to the Mona Lisa, baby.

01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:05.269
We look at you,
or look at the camera?

01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:08.438
- Okay, look at me.
- Under Mona Lisa or over Mona Lisa?

01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:12.810
Okay, come on. Behave.

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:14.682
No, can't do that.

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:15.844
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:17.752
It's a pleasure.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:22.523
Okay.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.765
How about the Caddyshack?

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:30.626
Here comes the...
The Baby Ruth candy bar, baby.

01:20:30.793 --> 01:20:33.672
Don't eat it, okay?
Just remember, okay?

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.467
Again?

01:20:35.631 --> 01:20:36.974
- Look at me.
- Look at you.

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:39.669
We can look at you, honey. Anytime.

01:20:45.974 --> 01:20:49.387
It's absolutely amazing in here.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.658
Not bad at all.

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:53.893
Invigorating.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.393
Have you always been
a photographer?

01:20:57.286 --> 01:20:58.629
On and off since college.

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:00.994
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:07.333
- Is that it? Anything else?
- Well, actually, I work in a bank.

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:10.375
I studied photography in school,
but I mean...

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:13.706
- I've gotta make a living.
- I used to be a branch manager.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.041
- You're kidding?
- Yeah.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.013
- That's what I am.
- Deadly serious.

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:18.742
- Okay.
Welcome to Iceland.

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:20.181
Oh, well, thank you.

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:22.754
This must be where
all the bank managers come.

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:23.912
Exactly.

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:26.685
Yeah, but he was a great
French horn player.

01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:30.092
He was the Al Hirt of French horns,
if you like jazz...

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:33.825
and he's the Beethoven
of the French horn, if you like classical.

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:40.904
I can see that.
You have that musician's air about you.

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:44.873
- It's... Really?
- Yeah.

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:47.539
Must be what I'm wearing.

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:49.911
- So you do play something?
- No.

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:51.710
- No?
- No, nothing at all.

01:21:51.874 --> 01:21:53.581
- You sing?
- No.

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:55.221
Terrible.

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:57.687
- Okay.
- Absolutely terrible.

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:00.850
I... Yeah, I went to karaoke
a few months ago...

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:05.055
and I slaughtered the song "Gypsy"
by Fleetwood Mac.

01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:07.699
- It's a good song.
- Not the way I sing it.

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:09.597
That's a shame.

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:11.430
It is.

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:15.268
- Dear.
- I do a great Bonnie Raitt karaoke.

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:19.078
I always forget the words.

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:23.639
That's why they have them
on the screen.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.776
Yeah, but if you're too loaded
to read them...

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.320
Yeah, well, I forgot about that.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.453
Think I'm gonna cut out on you guys.

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:38.325
I think I need a little doob-ification,
if you know what I mean.

01:22:38.487 --> 01:22:39.727
- Okay
- Okay.

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.561
Little doob-ification.

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:43.100
Are both of you going?

01:22:43.492 --> 01:22:45.233
No. No, I'll stay.

01:22:45.394 --> 01:22:47.931
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:50.842
Why not?

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:52.137
Yeah, sounds good.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:55.612
I look like a wrinkled prune.
I'd hate you to see that.

01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:58.115
I'm gonna wait till it gets dark, okay.

01:23:12.955 --> 01:23:19.839
Peter O'Toole, Steve Guttenberg,
and Jennifer Tilly.

01:23:23.799 --> 01:23:27.144
- You don't have a clue, do you?
- No I haven't... I have no idea.

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:30.010
It's High Spirits.

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:32.652
Did you ever see...

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.488
- Dirty Rotten Scoundrels?
- Yes.

01:23:35.644 --> 01:23:38.648
When Steve Marlin's in jail
trying to remember the name...

01:23:38.814 --> 01:23:42.227
of Michael Game's character,
and he's there and he's going:

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:46.129
“Fif... Fifen... Fiienhausen."

01:23:46.288 --> 01:23:51.237
And he goes through all of these...
All these stupid names. That's funny.

01:23:52.995 --> 01:23:56.204
- Okay. Me.
- All right.

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:05.247
- I'll give you an easy one.
- Okay.

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:09.546
- Danny DeVito...
- Okay.

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:12.248
and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

01:24:12.848 --> 01:24:14.418
Twins.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:17.086
- Please.
- It's one of my favorite films.

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.526
I love that film.

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.096
"Vincent."

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:26.762
Come on. Give me another one.
Give me another.

01:24:26.929 --> 01:24:31.571
"Vincent, I am your brother."

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:37.706
"Oh, obviously. The minute I sat down,
I thought I was looking in a mirror."

01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:40.752
"You're such a girly man."

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.581
- All right. All right.
- Gotta love Arnold.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:47.386
- This has been fun.
- Yeah.

01:24:47.549 --> 01:24:51.087
I don't know if I've been this relaxed
for a long time.

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:54.257
Yeah, this has been really nice.

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:58.565
Yeah. How about another dip
in the morning? You wanna do that?

01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:01.906
Actually, I'm heading out.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:03.572
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:25:03.732 --> 01:25:05.439
Heading up to the airport.

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:06.944
Well, that's a shame.

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:08.809
Yeah.

01:25:08.971 --> 01:25:12.748
Well, that leaves me with Mitch.

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:15.655
Who is not a good substitute for you.

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:23.055
I have a really nice warm spot here.

01:25:23.986 --> 01:25:25.659
Why don't you come over?

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.392
Over there?

01:25:28.724 --> 01:25:31.102
It sounds like a really good idea,
doesn't it?

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:35.139
- Yeah. If you don't mind.
Because it's kind of cool over here.

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:11.329
You know, I did one of your crossword
puzzles yesterday evening.

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:17.204
I did pretty good at it
until I got up to the right-hand corner...

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:22.610
and there was some Siberian river
that started with a Y.

01:27:24.106 --> 01:27:26.086
Yenisey.

01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:29.019
Yup, that was it.

01:27:35.784 --> 01:27:38.196
I'm gonna be sorry to leave this place,
Mitch.

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:41.027
Don't get that Sunday afternoon attitude,
you know?

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:44.762
It's not over with yet.
We still got the spa.

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:48.305
- Spa? What spa?
- The spa. We talked about the spa.

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:52.434
- No, we didn't talk about the spa.
- Well, thing about it is this...

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:55.639
you don't worry about it,
I got the spa handled.

01:27:55.804 --> 01:27:57.647
- Good.
- Got it handled for you.
