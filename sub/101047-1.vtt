WEBVTT

01:48.025 --> 01:49.961
This
is interrogation room one

01:49.994 --> 01:52.829
where we see beyond
the lies and coverups,

01:52.863 --> 01:57.101
searching for truth and
putting criminals behind bars.

01:57.134 --> 02:00.104
I used to think that if I did
enough good in this world,

02:00.137 --> 02:02.039
nothing bad would happen to me,

02:03.007 --> 02:04.607
that if I locked
up the bad guys,

02:04.641 --> 02:06.810
I could stave off all
the horrible tragedies

02:06.843 --> 02:08.678
we see every day.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.547
I can't stop it.

02:10.580 --> 02:13.783
The following images provide
a glimpse into my world.

02:21.524 --> 02:24.962
Chrissy, I'm District
Attorney, Ann Walker

02:24.996 --> 02:26.496
and this is Detective Daniels.

02:38.409 --> 02:39.509
How are you feeling?

02:42.146 --> 02:43.247
I feel pretty good.

02:44.482 --> 02:46.917
Why am I here, am I in trouble?

02:46.951 --> 02:48.551
No sweetie, not at all.

02:50.687 --> 02:52.555
The hospital reported,

02:52.589 --> 02:56.060
they think you're
being physically abused

02:56.093 --> 02:58.661
and we wanna find
out who did it.

03:00.697 --> 03:01.731
It's not true.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.435
Yeah, they shouldn't
have said that.

03:07.438 --> 03:10.607
They're required by
law to report any patient

03:10.640 --> 03:12.276
they think is a victim of abuse.

03:13.444 --> 03:14.879
Did someone hit you?

03:15.779 --> 03:16.613
No.

03:17.814 --> 03:20.451
The report said that
you were hemorrhaging

03:20.484 --> 03:22.286
and if you hadn't have
gotten in when you did,

03:22.319 --> 03:24.088
you might very well have died.

03:25.489 --> 03:28.825
Someone hit me when they
tried to take my purse

03:28.859 --> 03:30.560
when I was getting
out of the car.

03:31.395 --> 03:32.863
I didn't see their face.

03:34.031 --> 03:36.067
We checked the
surveillance tapes

03:36.100 --> 03:39.403
in the parking lot at the
time you said this happened.

03:39.437 --> 03:42.739
All it shows is you getting
out of the car and passing out.

03:43.908 --> 03:45.509
No one hit you.

03:45.543 --> 03:48.145
You live with your
father, correct?

03:48.179 --> 03:48.979
Yes.

03:50.381 --> 03:52.816
How would you describe
your relationship with him?

03:53.951 --> 03:54.919
What do you mean?

03:56.387 --> 03:59.223
Do you two get along,
no trouble between you?

04:01.292 --> 04:02.460
No.

04:02.493 --> 04:03.394
Dad loves me.

04:05.196 --> 04:06.397
He takes care of me.

04:07.898 --> 04:10.767
Chrissy, I'm home,
I'm hungry and I'm beat.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.902
What's for dinner?

04:11.936 --> 04:14.038
Steak, mashed
potatoes and asparagus.

04:14.071 --> 04:16.574
Good, I hope it's
edible this time.

04:16.606 --> 04:19.776
Those idiots at the county
have been a nightmare.

04:19.809 --> 04:21.077
I work with idiots.

04:22.645 --> 04:24.714
I made it just how
you like it tonight.

04:27.384 --> 04:29.286
Did you pick up the battery
for the remote control

04:29.320 --> 04:31.088
like I asked you to?

04:31.122 --> 04:34.091
I forgot, I'm sorry, I just
got so caught up in cooking

04:34.125 --> 04:36.360
and studying for my test,
I just, it slipped my mind,

04:36.393 --> 04:37.561
- dad, I'm sorry...
- What do you think

04:37.595 --> 04:38.761
I asked you today, like
three or four times?

04:38.795 --> 04:40.264
- Yes sir.
- Yeah the game is on tonight.

04:40.297 --> 04:41.764
Yeah yeah yeah and why is
it that I always end up

04:41.798 --> 04:44.701
having to yell at you to get
anything done around here?

04:44.734 --> 04:46.237
- Sorry...
- No!

04:46.270 --> 04:47.171
I'll get 'em as soon as
I wake up in the morning.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.439
No, you won't pick it up!

04:48.472 --> 04:49.373
I will pick it up, just
like I do at the office

04:49.406 --> 04:50.773
because you are worthless!

04:50.807 --> 04:52.276
Sorry, I'll try to be better.

04:52.309 --> 04:54.644
No, you won't
try to be better!

04:56.514 --> 04:57.780
Don't cry!

04:57.814 --> 04:59.517
- Don't cry!
- I'm sorry.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.818
I'm sorry.

05:01.852 --> 05:03.454
You make me sick.

05:10.394 --> 05:14.231
X-rays indicate a break in
your arm in the wrist area.

05:15.332 --> 05:16.901
How long ago did this happen?

05:18.235 --> 05:19.336
About a year ago.

05:22.006 --> 05:24.341
I fell and landed on my wrist.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.377
We see these
cases all the time,

05:28.145 --> 05:30.813
victims denying what's
being done to them.

05:33.317 --> 05:34.985
It never ends well.

05:35.019 --> 05:36.753
Victims protect their
loved ones to the point

05:36.786 --> 05:38.788
that it goes too far.

05:38.821 --> 05:41.425
Victims end up being
permanently maimed

05:41.458 --> 05:42.960
or worse yet, killed.

05:44.495 --> 05:47.364
Tell us what's happening
before it's too late.

05:49.033 --> 05:52.670
I promise, we'll protect you.

05:57.241 --> 06:00.544
It's not his fault, it's me,

06:00.578 --> 06:03.746
I never do anything right
and he just gets frustrated.

06:05.149 --> 06:08.852
That's common for the victim
to think they're to blame,

06:10.187 --> 06:12.623
but it's not true.

06:12.656 --> 06:14.592
Your father does
this, doesn't he?

06:16.594 --> 06:18.929
Dad's just trying
to make me better.

06:18.963 --> 06:22.433
If I tell you, he'll give
up on me and kick me out.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.603
It's time to stop your
father from hurting you.

06:26.971 --> 06:29.306
If he gets physical,
you need to tell us.

06:29.340 --> 06:30.307
It's your father.

06:32.576 --> 06:36.614
I promise, he will
not hurt you anymore

06:36.647 --> 06:40.117
if you only tell us
he did this to you.

06:42.286 --> 06:44.321
No, I'm ready to leave.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.761
Who do you think you are
speaking to my daughter?

06:53.864 --> 06:55.232
The hospital
reported your daughter

06:55.266 --> 06:56.634
as a possible abuse victim.

06:57.968 --> 06:59.670
We brought her in to talk to us.

06:59.703 --> 07:01.438
And who are you exactly?

07:01.472 --> 07:03.440
District Attorney Walker.

07:03.474 --> 07:06.076
To be exact, I prosecute
abusive bullies.

07:06.110 --> 07:07.578
Oh good for you.

07:07.611 --> 07:09.079
So what did Chrissy say?

07:09.113 --> 07:11.848
Nothing, she's too
traumatized by you.

07:11.882 --> 07:13.117
Is she really?

07:13.150 --> 07:14.385
So you felt it was
okay for you guys

07:14.418 --> 07:17.054
to stick your nose in
my family's business.

07:17.087 --> 07:18.788
I don't want either of
you speaking to Chrissy.

07:18.821 --> 07:20.324
You understand?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.792
Chrissy's 18, she
can speak for herself.

07:22.825 --> 07:25.095
I have taken care of
Chrissy for 18 years.

07:25.129 --> 07:26.930
I make decisions for her.

07:26.964 --> 07:28.599
Leave us alone.

07:29.433 --> 07:30.768
I'm warning you.

07:35.105 --> 07:36.607
You okay?

07:36.640 --> 07:39.443
You think Chrissy's got the
stuff to stand up for herself?

07:41.312 --> 07:43.681
Maybe, I don't know.

07:45.482 --> 07:47.251
Just another fine day.

07:56.826 --> 07:59.396
Thank you, dad,
for picking me up.

07:59.430 --> 08:01.565
So what happened in there?

08:01.598 --> 08:04.435
They just wanted to
know how I got injured.

08:04.468 --> 08:06.537
And what did you tell them?

08:06.570 --> 08:09.940
I told them that I was
robbed in a parking lot

08:09.973 --> 08:11.709
and it was the
robber who hit me...

08:11.742 --> 08:13.610
That's good,
that's really good.

08:13.644 --> 08:15.479
So everything's okay then?

08:15.512 --> 08:18.115
Um, they didn't believe me.

08:18.148 --> 08:20.617
They actually kept asking
me questions about you.

08:22.319 --> 08:23.420
And you told them
nothing, right?

08:23.454 --> 08:24.355
Right.

08:24.388 --> 08:26.623
Right, that's my good girl.

08:26.657 --> 08:28.058
Because

08:28.092 --> 08:29.660
if you tell them anything,

08:29.693 --> 08:30.928
you know what
happens, don't you?

08:30.961 --> 08:32.363
- Yes, yes sir.
- Okay?

08:34.030 --> 08:34.998
All right, let's go home.

08:38.836 --> 08:39.669
It's okay.

08:41.304 --> 08:42.673
How's the nose?

08:44.675 --> 08:46.977
It hurts a lot.

08:49.246 --> 08:51.815
Norman, we're gonna charge you

08:51.849 --> 08:53.852
with murder and
attempted murder.

08:54.718 --> 08:56.453
That doesn't sound good.

08:56.487 --> 08:57.755
No, it doesn't.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.726
We know you stabbed crazy
Billy and you killed Perry.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.396
What we don't know is, is why?

09:05.429 --> 09:07.531
Does self-defense count?

09:07.564 --> 09:09.600
'Cause that's what it was.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.870
Well why don't you
start from the beginning?

09:14.772 --> 09:17.341
We were sitting around
the table, drinking.

09:17.374 --> 09:19.042
Billy, he's mad at me

09:19.076 --> 09:21.278
and hits me in the face
with a vodka bottle.

09:22.546 --> 09:25.682
You're both stupid,
you know that?

09:25.716 --> 09:27.451
I had this whole
thing figured out.

09:28.619 --> 09:32.956
All we had to do was
break into the office,

09:32.990 --> 09:34.458
steal the money box.

09:35.894 --> 09:38.295
Then sit on the
money for a year,

09:38.328 --> 09:39.696
without spending any of it.

09:40.631 --> 09:42.132
So nobody would suspect us.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.202
Crazy Billy.

09:46.403 --> 09:48.739
What are you, some kind
of psycho or something?

09:51.041 --> 09:53.444
No, I'm just Crazy Billy.

09:54.879 --> 09:57.681
Well I give up, why do
they call you Crazy Billy?

10:00.184 --> 10:02.119
Because when I was a kid,

10:02.152 --> 10:06.223
I used to get so mad that I'd
throw myself on the floor,

10:06.256 --> 10:08.425
just kicking and screaming.

10:08.459 --> 10:12.696
My aunt said, "Now
ain't that crazy?"

10:12.729 --> 10:15.766
From then on, people
just call me Crazy Billy.

10:17.167 --> 10:18.635
Okay.

10:18.669 --> 10:21.338
Well why don't you tell me
what happened this morning.

10:22.272 --> 10:23.875
It was self-defense.

10:23.908 --> 10:27.211
Wait a minute, you
stabbed Perry 30 times.

10:27.244 --> 10:29.580
How is that self-defense?

10:29.613 --> 10:31.782
Not self-defense,
what happened to Perry.

10:33.852 --> 10:36.787
Self-defense on what
happened to Norman.

10:36.820 --> 10:37.688
Norman?

10:38.822 --> 10:40.023
Well what about Norman?

10:41.458 --> 10:43.962
I hit Norman over the
face with a vodka bottle.

10:43.994 --> 10:46.096
Well you got Perry's
blood all over ya.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.800
I got my blood all over me.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.768
Well why don't you
start from the beginning

10:51.802 --> 10:53.070
and tell me what happened?

10:55.506 --> 10:58.375
No, that was your plan,
that wasn't our plan.

10:59.543 --> 11:02.246
I don't see why we
couldn't spend a little.

11:02.279 --> 11:03.480
A little?

11:03.514 --> 11:04.648
You and Billy spent
all your shares.

11:05.984 --> 11:06.817
Now you're broke.

11:08.018 --> 11:09.286
But not me, boys.

11:12.289 --> 11:13.958
I haven't spent one thin dime.

11:17.794 --> 11:20.731
Gonna need some of the
money you got there, Perry.

11:20.764 --> 11:21.565
Oh yeah?

11:21.598 --> 11:22.432
Yeah, so am I.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.436
No.

11:31.876 --> 11:33.310
What are you doing, Norman?

11:34.811 --> 11:36.480
You're gonna kill Perry.

11:52.262 --> 11:53.096
Grab his arms!

12:05.609 --> 12:06.843
I grabbed the
knife on the table,

12:06.878 --> 12:08.378
stabbed Billy and left.

12:09.713 --> 12:12.816
Perry's dead and
you had the knife.

12:12.849 --> 12:15.786
So you're the one that
stabbed him 30 times.

12:15.819 --> 12:16.653
Perry's dead?

12:17.487 --> 12:19.523
He was fine when I left.

12:19.556 --> 12:20.925
You expect me to believe

12:20.959 --> 12:23.260
you had nothing to do
with Perry's death?

12:24.227 --> 12:25.095
Absolutely

12:26.496 --> 12:28.398
and we had the league
championship this weekend.

12:30.367 --> 12:33.071
Billy must have done this
and he's trying to blame me.

12:34.338 --> 12:35.839
I see.

12:35.873 --> 12:37.774
Well we're gonna hold
you for a few days

12:37.808 --> 12:39.242
while we sort this out.

12:40.377 --> 12:42.013
What about the
league championship?

12:44.381 --> 12:46.817
Okay, I was in the kitchen.

12:48.218 --> 12:50.287
I heard this ruckus going
on in the dining room.

12:51.856 --> 12:53.357
So I went out in the dining room

12:53.390 --> 12:54.558
and by the time I get there,

12:54.591 --> 12:56.995
Norman is standing over
Perry with a knife.

12:57.962 --> 12:59.329
Well then what happened?

12:59.363 --> 13:01.231
Well Norm comes
at me with the knife

13:01.264 --> 13:04.002
so I pick up the vodka
bottle by its neck

13:04.035 --> 13:06.236
and Norman stabbed me.

13:06.269 --> 13:08.639
I hit him across the face
with the vodka bottle.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.642
Amazing how much
damage can be done

13:11.675 --> 13:13.443
to a man's nose
with a vodka bottle.

13:14.912 --> 13:18.315
He staggers back, plunges
a knife into Perry's back

13:18.348 --> 13:19.851
and goes out the backdoor.

13:21.151 --> 13:22.252
That's it?

13:22.285 --> 13:23.787
That's it.

13:23.820 --> 13:27.424
All right, now you
said Norman stabbed you.

13:27.457 --> 13:28.291
Where?

13:30.460 --> 13:32.529
Is that a garbage bag?

13:32.562 --> 13:33.397
Yeah.

13:34.531 --> 13:36.233
Wrapped around to
keep the pressure on.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.769
Keeps the blood from oozing.

13:40.138 --> 13:43.240
I've had that as my
laundry bag for two years.

13:44.441 --> 13:46.010
Guess I'm gonna have
to get another one.

13:47.678 --> 13:50.781
Okay, I'm gonna
call the EMT's.

13:54.217 --> 13:55.252
Nice, nice.

13:55.285 --> 13:56.120
You like that?

13:56.154 --> 13:56.988
Absolutely.

13:58.156 --> 14:00.590
Robert Jinx, you
here to confess?

14:00.624 --> 14:01.792
Chrissy told me
that she told you

14:01.825 --> 14:03.593
that she was robbed
at a parking lot

14:03.627 --> 14:04.962
and you called her a liar.

14:04.996 --> 14:07.965
Hey, nobody calls
my kid a liar, okay?

14:07.999 --> 14:09.599
Just do your damn job!

14:20.945 --> 14:22.345
So what do you got for me?

14:24.148 --> 14:26.249
Those stories Norman
and Billy told you?

14:27.551 --> 14:29.020
They're both lying.

14:29.921 --> 14:30.754
Really?

14:31.755 --> 14:33.523
Fill me in please.

14:33.557 --> 14:36.861
Our forensics confirm
that Billy used the bottle

14:36.894 --> 14:40.297
to hit Norman and
Norman stabbed Perry.

14:40.330 --> 14:41.565
So we're nowhere.

14:42.566 --> 14:43.767
No, there's more.

14:45.769 --> 14:48.572
Perry was put in a choke hold

14:48.605 --> 14:51.274
and given the nature
of the damage,

14:51.308 --> 14:53.276
it had to be a big fellow.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.511
Norman.

14:54.544 --> 14:57.481
Exactly and
bruising on the arms

14:57.514 --> 14:59.951
indicates that someone else

14:59.984 --> 15:03.720
tightly held Perry's arms
while he was being stabbed.

15:05.857 --> 15:08.926
Their statements tell us
they were the only ones there.

15:10.027 --> 15:12.362
So they both killed
him together.

15:12.395 --> 15:13.396
That is correct.

15:15.499 --> 15:20.504
So, they both came in and
they both told different stories

15:21.939 --> 15:23.640
thinking that we couldn't
prove which one did it.

15:24.976 --> 15:28.913
And they probably
planned on dumping the body

15:28.946 --> 15:31.848
until a neighbor heard the
ruckus and called the police.

15:31.883 --> 15:35.352
They concocted a story
hoping to get out of it.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.024
You know the
other day at church

15:40.057 --> 15:43.693
when the pastor spoke
about leading by example,

15:45.963 --> 15:48.132
what kind of example do
you think these guys had

15:48.166 --> 15:49.200
when they grew up?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.137
Honestly, I couldn't tell you.

15:53.171 --> 15:55.239
They could've come
from loving families.

15:56.874 --> 15:59.110
Seems like more and more
people are straying.

16:17.995 --> 16:21.098
What are these
paintings on the wall?

16:21.132 --> 16:23.868
They're called icons,
windows to Heaven.

16:25.335 --> 16:28.105
Those are glass into
eternity and what awaits us.

16:30.340 --> 16:31.175
You a priest?

16:32.843 --> 16:35.645
I am Father Thomas Francis,
the pastor of this church.

16:37.647 --> 16:40.017
Do you have a minute
to talk with me?

16:41.986 --> 16:42.819
Certainly.

16:44.354 --> 16:45.156
Please.

16:49.659 --> 16:50.527
May I sit?

16:50.560 --> 16:51.394
Sure.

16:54.631 --> 16:56.067
What's your name?

16:56.100 --> 16:57.567
Elizabeth Waters.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.337
Very nice to meet
you, Elizabeth.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.106
Are you a Catholic?

17:02.139 --> 17:05.175
No, I'm not religious.

17:05.209 --> 17:06.509
Do you believe in God?

17:07.711 --> 17:08.811
I don't know.

17:09.981 --> 17:12.183
That's not the reason I'm here.

17:12.215 --> 17:14.886
I just really need
to talk to you.

17:16.253 --> 17:18.387
Okay, how can I help you?

17:18.421 --> 17:21.491
So, two years ago,

17:21.523 --> 17:24.929
I did something that
has just ruined my life.

17:26.529 --> 17:29.200
I was at a party
and on my way home,

17:29.233 --> 17:31.534
I was driving and I hit someone.

17:32.702 --> 17:34.038
This man stepped
in front of my car

17:34.071 --> 17:36.506
and it happened so fast
that I heard a thump,

17:36.539 --> 17:38.009
but I kept on driving.

17:39.442 --> 17:42.980
I was too afraid to stop and
the next day on our news,

17:43.014 --> 17:44.481
I heard that there
was a hit and run

17:44.514 --> 17:47.919
and that a homeless man, he
was in critical condition.

17:48.953 --> 17:50.121
I think he died.

17:53.124 --> 17:54.824
Did you report
it to the police?

17:54.859 --> 17:56.826
No, I was too scared.

17:58.162 --> 17:59.897
So now here I am.

18:02.066 --> 18:04.001
I used to be so happy, Father,

18:04.035 --> 18:06.536
but I just can't
live with this guilt.

18:08.805 --> 18:10.107
I wish I never
went to that party.

18:10.141 --> 18:14.778
I wish I, I wish, I
hate my life, I hate me.

18:14.811 --> 18:17.348
I've thought of ending it all.

18:17.381 --> 18:20.351
No, Elizabeth,
that's not the way out.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.387
God loves you.

18:23.421 --> 18:25.789
You, Elizabeth are
very special to him.

18:27.258 --> 18:28.960
Do you know who Jesus is?

18:28.993 --> 18:32.330
Yes, I mean, I
grew up in church.

18:32.363 --> 18:36.666
Well Jesus said, "Come to
me, all you who are weary

18:36.700 --> 18:40.704
"and carry heavy burdens
and I will give you rest."

18:40.737 --> 18:42.306
He loves you, Elizabeth.

18:44.774 --> 18:47.378
Why, why would God love me?

18:47.411 --> 18:48.879
I killed someone.

18:51.581 --> 18:55.319
Elizabeth, God
came into the world

18:55.353 --> 18:58.755
and took on flesh and
his name is Jesus.

18:58.788 --> 19:01.425
He was born of the
blessed Virgin Mary,

19:01.459 --> 19:04.561
hung on a cross, died
and on the third day,

19:04.594 --> 19:07.831
rose from the dead so that
we may have eternal life.

19:08.933 --> 19:11.068
He even forgave
those who killed him.

19:12.937 --> 19:15.473
He is the way,

19:15.505 --> 19:16.340
the truth

19:17.441 --> 19:18.442
and the life.

19:20.844 --> 19:23.280
If you want to free
yourself from this guilt,

19:23.314 --> 19:25.483
you have to do the right thing.

19:25.515 --> 19:27.451
What would that
be, turn myself in?

19:29.619 --> 19:31.755
I know you don't wanna
face the consequences.

19:31.788 --> 19:33.257
I don't want to go to jail.

19:35.226 --> 19:37.862
Well, but the truth
will set you free

19:37.895 --> 19:40.297
and you don't have to
face the consequences,

19:40.331 --> 19:41.564
but I know you have to.

19:42.466 --> 19:43.300
Okay?

19:45.336 --> 19:47.537
I believe God brought
you here for a reason.

19:48.939 --> 19:52.476
He wants you to know him
and the love he has for you.

19:53.777 --> 19:56.180
He wants to grant you
his mercy and healing.

19:57.348 --> 19:58.149
How?

19:59.350 --> 20:02.453
Ask him into your
heart, your life.

20:03.988 --> 20:05.923
Be truly sorry for your sins.

20:07.191 --> 20:09.692
Believe in him and
then follow him.

20:12.562 --> 20:16.467
May I say a little prayer
and ask God to help you?

20:16.500 --> 20:17.567
All right.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.835
Can we hold hands?

20:21.638 --> 20:26.643
Heavenly Father, you know
all things before we even ask

20:27.811 --> 20:30.014
and you said to ask
and you shall receive.

20:31.982 --> 20:34.218
I bring before you
Elizabeth, Lord,

20:34.251 --> 20:37.388
give her strength and
courage to do what is right

20:39.090 --> 20:42.159
and most of all,
Lord, open her heart

20:42.193 --> 20:46.564
that she may truly know you
and experience your love.

20:47.865 --> 20:50.935
I ask this in the
precious name of Jesus.

20:50.968 --> 20:54.205
Jesus.

20:54.238 --> 20:57.807
I'm sorry
what I've done.

20:57.841 --> 21:01.178
Forgive me, please
come into my life.

21:01.212 --> 21:03.347
I believe that you are God.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.181
Help me.

21:10.221 --> 21:13.257
Elizabeth, no
matter what happens,

21:13.290 --> 21:14.992
know that God is in control

21:16.527 --> 21:21.365
and that all things
work for good

21:21.398 --> 21:22.500
for those who love God

21:23.567 --> 21:26.270
and are called according
to his purpose.

21:28.771 --> 21:30.207
I have a friend downtown.

21:30.241 --> 21:32.977
He's a detective, real nice
guy and he can help you.

21:34.378 --> 21:35.980
I think you should go see him.

21:37.148 --> 21:38.616
Are you willing to do this?

21:39.682 --> 21:41.218
Yes.

21:41.252 --> 21:45.122
If you want, I'll go
along to support you.

21:46.891 --> 21:48.259
I'd like that.

22:05.042 --> 22:06.343
Uncle Billy.

22:06.377 --> 22:09.580
Hey Devon, how are ya, buddy?

22:09.613 --> 22:11.115
Oh where's your grandmother?

22:12.249 --> 22:14.351
Um, she's coming,
she's just slow.

22:14.385 --> 22:15.886
It's good to see you, buddy.

22:18.389 --> 22:21.791
Hey sis, you came
downtown to see me?

22:23.127 --> 22:26.363
Yes, Devin had an appointment
at Children's Hospital.

22:27.665 --> 22:28.599
I see.

22:29.533 --> 22:30.968
Hey buddy,

22:34.138 --> 22:36.373
you remember where
that soda machine is?

22:39.410 --> 22:40.244
Tell me.

22:42.980 --> 22:45.182
Yesterday I picked Devin up to

22:45.216 --> 22:47.685
have him with me for a few days.

22:47.717 --> 22:49.887
Last night, I was
pulling his t-shirt off

22:49.920 --> 22:52.822
to give him a shower, he winced.

22:54.425 --> 22:56.594
I took him to the
doctor this morning

22:56.627 --> 22:59.729
and he sent us to Children's
Hospital for X-rays.

23:01.232 --> 23:03.701
Turns out his shoulder was
pulled out of the socket.

23:04.969 --> 23:06.570
Exams indicate abuse.

23:10.740 --> 23:11.841
How did this happen?

23:12.876 --> 23:15.713
Sissy has a new boyfriend.

23:15.745 --> 23:18.349
I believe they get
drunk every night.

23:18.382 --> 23:20.651
Okay, I'll have him picked up.

23:21.719 --> 23:23.420
It's already done.

23:23.454 --> 23:25.289
Hospital called everyone.

23:25.322 --> 23:26.789
Child Protective Services?

23:26.823 --> 23:27.824
Of course.

23:27.858 --> 23:30.027
Well how did you take Devin?

23:31.794 --> 23:33.030
You.

23:33.063 --> 23:35.733
I promised them I would
come straight to you

23:35.765 --> 23:38.469
and that I would have you
call as soon as I got here.

23:39.970 --> 23:41.872
Devin had started to cry.

23:41.905 --> 23:42.873
They caved.

23:44.308 --> 23:45.976
Okay, I'll call.

23:46.010 --> 23:49.513
In the meantime, I'll get
the D.A. to call a judge

23:49.546 --> 23:52.182
and get Devin placed
in your custody.

23:53.617 --> 23:56.520
You know, I spent a lifetime
putting trash like that away.

23:58.088 --> 24:01.959
I mean, I think, why does
anybody deserve this?

24:04.561 --> 24:07.031
You have been doing
this a long time.

24:08.532 --> 24:11.101
Don't you think it's
time for a break?

24:11.135 --> 24:12.903
Yeah, it's not the same.

24:14.571 --> 24:15.439
Or maybe,

24:16.674 --> 24:18.142
maybe I'm not the same.

24:21.412 --> 24:23.080
Thank you, Uncle Billy.

24:25.416 --> 24:26.550
How would you like it

24:26.583 --> 24:28.886
if we stayed at Uncle
Billy's tonight?

24:28.919 --> 24:31.288
Yes, I don't wanna go home.

24:40.998 --> 24:43.434
Uh, s'cuse me uh...

24:43.467 --> 24:44.702
Dr. Gordon.

24:44.735 --> 24:47.738
Uh, Dr. Gordon, eh,
is the nurse around or...

24:47.771 --> 24:49.340
She's out to lunch,
how may I help you?

24:49.373 --> 24:51.342
Uh, Chrissy Jinx, she's here?

24:51.375 --> 24:54.011
Dr. Carl's with here, he'll
be out in just a moment.

24:54.044 --> 24:55.479
Oh, doctor.

24:55.512 --> 24:56.413
Hi, how's Chrissy?

24:57.781 --> 25:01.018
Not good, she's been
beat up pretty bad.

25:01.051 --> 25:02.319
Well, can I see her?

25:03.687 --> 25:06.156
Considering the severity
of the circumstance,

25:06.190 --> 25:07.524
she needs to rest.

25:07.558 --> 25:10.794
Has the District
Attorney been here yet?

25:10.828 --> 25:11.762
I haven't seen her.

25:11.795 --> 25:12.596
Excuse me.

25:20.003 --> 25:21.071
Tell me.

25:21.105 --> 25:22.373
Doctor's in there now.

25:25.042 --> 25:25.876
How is she?

25:27.111 --> 25:27.945
She's awake.

25:29.079 --> 25:29.913
Can I see her?

25:33.650 --> 25:34.485
Five minutes.

25:36.487 --> 25:37.621
I'm going in alone.

25:40.758 --> 25:42.292
Thank you, Doctor.

25:57.007 --> 25:58.075
What'd you do wrong?

25:59.410 --> 26:00.244
What?

26:02.346 --> 26:05.149
You must have screwed up
something big to end up here.

26:08.152 --> 26:09.153
What was it?

26:10.889 --> 26:12.022
Blew up half the house?

26:13.090 --> 26:14.124
Totaled the car?

26:16.427 --> 26:18.662
Gambled away the
entire savings account?

26:21.131 --> 26:21.965
What?

26:23.033 --> 26:23.868
I,

26:27.538 --> 26:30.107
I put too much starch
in his work clothes.

26:31.308 --> 26:32.142
Hm.

26:33.243 --> 26:35.312
You put too much starch
in his work shirt

26:37.514 --> 26:38.515
and you end up here.

26:41.051 --> 26:42.653
Can you hear how insane this is?

26:43.922 --> 26:46.290
Would you expect me or
Daniels to smack you

26:46.323 --> 26:48.325
for dropping a pen on the floor?

26:48.358 --> 26:51.595
No, but he's
different than you are.

26:51.628 --> 26:54.498
Okay, he's under so
much more stress.

26:56.467 --> 27:00.771
Why do you live each day
expecting that from him?

27:12.049 --> 27:13.383
I know what you live with.

27:16.687 --> 27:21.158
Each day to be
told you're useless

27:24.228 --> 27:27.097
or a waste of a human being.

27:30.100 --> 27:33.537
Each day beat down.

27:38.075 --> 27:40.979
That, you can't
get anything right.

27:45.182 --> 27:46.951
That it's your fault.

27:50.153 --> 27:52.857
I know what it's
like to tense up

27:54.057 --> 27:55.994
when that person
walks through the door

28:01.465 --> 28:03.868
and to sit each morning

28:05.769 --> 28:08.338
hoping that

28:10.374 --> 28:11.341
today is a good day.

28:17.781 --> 28:18.615
I know.

28:20.083 --> 28:21.518
I am so scared.

28:23.720 --> 28:25.722
I don't know what to do.

28:27.926 --> 28:30.028
You have to get
your life back.

28:31.762 --> 28:35.365
You have to tell him he doesn't
have the right to hurt you.

28:37.734 --> 28:38.835
No one has that right.

28:41.471 --> 28:43.607
He'll hit me.

28:46.209 --> 28:48.947
He'll stop loving me.

28:56.854 --> 29:01.358
And then,

29:03.193 --> 29:04.528
I'll become nothing.

29:07.899 --> 29:09.099
Not if we back you up,

29:10.567 --> 29:12.469
put a restraining
order in place,

29:14.438 --> 29:15.839
get you with a support group

29:17.274 --> 29:19.443
and put you on the path
to getting your life back.

29:22.312 --> 29:23.347
Trust me, Chrissy.

29:26.183 --> 29:27.018
Can you do that?

29:32.857 --> 29:36.226
Detective Daniels and I,
we'll be here for you.

29:39.964 --> 29:40.932
I'll be right back.

29:52.242 --> 29:54.645
Do you remember when you asked
if Chrissy had the stuff?

29:54.678 --> 29:55.479
Mmhmm.

29:55.512 --> 29:56.446
Wake up Jenks.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.648
With pleasure.

30:02.987 --> 30:04.187
Hey.

30:04.221 --> 30:06.456
Saw you talking to
that attorney woman.

30:06.490 --> 30:08.092
What'd you tell her?

30:08.126 --> 30:08.960
Nothing.

30:09.961 --> 30:11.461
That was a lot of nothing.

30:11.495 --> 30:13.131
You were my good little
girl, weren't you?

30:13.163 --> 30:14.398
Help, help?

30:14.431 --> 30:15.766
Nobody cares,
nobody can hear you,

30:15.799 --> 30:17.701
no one's gonna rescue
you, so shut up!

30:17.734 --> 30:21.438
No more, no
more!

30:21.471 --> 30:24.241
You have no right
to hit me ever!

30:24.274 --> 30:26.077
All I've ever done was
try to make you better!

30:26.110 --> 30:29.413
All I've ever done is try
to please you and love you.

30:29.446 --> 30:32.150
All you've ever done is
make me feel worthless.

30:32.182 --> 30:33.316
Because you are worthless!

30:33.350 --> 30:34.484
You're worthless!

30:34.518 --> 30:35.485
Don't come crawling back!

30:35.519 --> 30:36.420
I hate you!

30:36.453 --> 30:38.856
You're done, you are done!

30:38.890 --> 30:40.124
You wanted to move
in with your mom.

30:40.158 --> 30:41.025
Oh, that's right,
she abandoned you.

30:41.059 --> 30:42.526
She killed herself!

30:42.559 --> 30:44.828
At least she never had
to put up with you again!

30:49.000 --> 30:50.367
You'll come crawling back.

30:53.336 --> 30:54.138
You'll be back.

30:58.408 --> 31:00.477
Good morning, Professor.

31:00.510 --> 31:05.083
I'm Detective Daniels and
this District Attorney Walker.

31:05.116 --> 31:06.717
Good morning, Professor.

31:06.750 --> 31:07.551
Nice hair.

31:08.953 --> 31:11.155
Professor, one of
your students is dead

31:11.189 --> 31:13.124
and you don't seem
bothered by that.

31:14.558 --> 31:17.461
It was a tragic suicide, but
I hardly knew the young man.

31:18.829 --> 31:21.798
Let's talk about the cheating
going on by your students.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.602
Yeah, that is regretful.

31:26.570 --> 31:28.271
I knew nothing about it.

31:28.305 --> 31:31.241
Rest assured, I had planned on
getting to the bottom of it.

31:33.410 --> 31:35.179
Thank you, Professor Russell.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.781
Keep us in the loop.

31:39.951 --> 31:40.784
You got it.

31:48.025 --> 31:50.228
What's with cutting him loose?

31:50.260 --> 31:52.429
I had a lot of
questions for that guy.

31:52.462 --> 31:53.764
He's guilty.

31:53.797 --> 31:56.500
I just don't want him
to believe we know that.

31:59.170 --> 32:02.140
Right, 'cause he'll start
to intimidate his students

32:02.173 --> 32:03.908
and just cover his tracks.

32:03.941 --> 32:04.841
Exactly.

32:10.047 --> 32:10.814
Tommy!

32:12.816 --> 32:14.317
I mean, Father Tom.

32:16.154 --> 32:16.954
How are ya?

32:16.988 --> 32:18.321
Doing great, Billy.

32:18.355 --> 32:19.823
Have you been going to church?

32:19.857 --> 32:21.259
I sure have.

32:22.459 --> 32:24.262
Billy and I, we
grew up together.

32:25.796 --> 32:29.499
So what brings you down
to this neck of the woods?

32:30.801 --> 32:34.337
I want you to meet
Elizabeth Waters.

32:34.371 --> 32:35.239
Hi.

32:35.273 --> 32:36.573
Well hello, Elizabeth Waters.

32:36.606 --> 32:37.440
Have a seat.

32:39.509 --> 32:42.646
Elizabeth had an accident
about two years ago

32:42.679 --> 32:44.314
and she never reported it.

32:45.515 --> 32:47.751
Evidently a man stepped
out in front of her car

32:47.784 --> 32:49.153
and she thinks she hit him.

32:50.587 --> 32:53.390
She was too scared to
stop so she kept driving.

32:53.423 --> 32:55.325
I didn't do it on purpose.

32:55.358 --> 32:57.094
He came out of nowhere.

32:57.128 --> 32:58.328
I'm truly very sorry.

32:59.997 --> 33:01.498
Well,

33:01.531 --> 33:04.835
can you tell me the details
as to when this happened?

33:04.869 --> 33:07.771
I was at a barbecue
at my friend's house

33:07.804 --> 33:09.372
and it was the 4th of July

33:09.406 --> 33:12.409
and I was driving
home around 11:00 p.m.

33:14.778 --> 33:18.149
Well this could be a
serious situation, Elizabeth.

33:19.482 --> 33:22.854
Let me pull up the
record, give me a second.

33:26.090 --> 33:28.758
Well according to the report,

33:29.927 --> 33:34.265
there was a hit and
run in the evening

33:34.298 --> 33:37.367
of July the 4th two years ago.

33:38.936 --> 33:43.840
It also states that a injured,

33:43.875 --> 33:48.745
intoxicated, homeless
man recovered

33:48.778 --> 33:51.949
and is now working
at the city mission.

33:53.184 --> 33:54.952
So in order to close the case,

33:54.986 --> 33:56.720
I need to take your statement.

33:56.753 --> 33:57.754
He's not dead?

33:59.090 --> 34:01.993
Alive and well and
working at the city mission.

34:04.228 --> 34:06.563
Is there anything you
can do for her, Billy?

34:06.596 --> 34:08.032
Well I can talk to the D.A.

34:09.565 --> 34:11.235
The judge'll probably
go easy on her

34:11.268 --> 34:13.271
since you don't have
a criminal record.

34:15.206 --> 34:17.909
You might have to do
some community service.

34:17.942 --> 34:19.342
Yeah.

34:19.377 --> 34:22.013
Well, young lady,
let's go to the next room

34:22.045 --> 34:24.982
and record your statement.

34:27.351 --> 34:29.619
Thank you, Father Thomas.

34:29.652 --> 34:31.755
God is real and merciful.

34:31.788 --> 34:32.621
Amen.

34:36.659 --> 34:37.761
Ann Walker.

34:39.297 --> 34:41.364
You look so serious.

34:41.399 --> 34:42.666
Jovanna.

34:42.699 --> 34:43.533
Good to see you.

34:46.003 --> 34:47.670
It's been a while.

34:47.704 --> 34:48.973
Seven years.

34:49.005 --> 34:49.839
Have a seat.

34:54.078 --> 34:56.646
I was really sad to
hear about David.

34:56.679 --> 35:00.051
Yeah, I'm still
having a hard time

35:00.084 --> 35:01.451
accepting what happened.

35:02.353 --> 35:04.255
What did happen?

35:04.288 --> 35:07.291
We were hiking and
enjoying the day.

35:07.325 --> 35:10.094
We got to the top of a
trail, on a mountain.

35:10.127 --> 35:12.363
He wanted me to
take his picture.

35:12.396 --> 35:14.098
He kept backing up.

35:14.131 --> 35:17.534
I told him to stop,
but it was windy

35:17.567 --> 35:19.502
and I guess he didn't hear me.

35:19.536 --> 35:21.138
I screamed stop,

35:21.172 --> 35:26.177
but some ground gave way
and he just fell away.

35:26.978 --> 35:28.245
Must have been tough

35:28.279 --> 35:30.982
going through the police
investigation and all.

35:31.015 --> 35:31.848
Yes.

35:33.650 --> 35:34.818
He was a good person.

35:36.954 --> 35:39.256
You know, he called
me a couple weeks ago.

35:41.192 --> 35:42.026
Oh really?

35:43.461 --> 35:45.628
Just to say hi, check in.

35:46.496 --> 35:47.331
Oh.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.471
I can remember your wedding
like it was yesterday.

35:54.405 --> 35:56.773
You two always seemed so happy.

35:57.875 --> 36:00.177
Yeah, we were lucky.

36:01.345 --> 36:02.480
Were you still happy?

36:04.148 --> 36:05.082
Of course.

36:06.183 --> 36:08.752
Because that
would have affected

36:08.785 --> 36:10.421
the course of the investigation.

36:11.621 --> 36:12.990
What are you implying?

36:14.657 --> 36:16.760
Gee, you're an attorney.

36:17.727 --> 36:19.063
You know what I'm implying.

36:21.132 --> 36:22.867
David told me that
you two were unhappy

36:22.900 --> 36:24.734
and that he was taking
this last trip with you

36:24.768 --> 36:27.371
to soften the blow of
asking for a divorce.

36:27.405 --> 36:29.606
Every couple has
their ups and down.

36:29.639 --> 36:32.343
He didn't ask for a divorce.

36:32.376 --> 36:33.477
Because you pushed
him off a cliff

36:33.511 --> 36:34.677
before he could ask for one.

36:34.711 --> 36:36.546
It's all conjecture.

36:39.216 --> 36:41.818
We'll see how
much is conjecture

36:41.852 --> 36:44.288
when I reopen the case
and tear your life apart.

36:46.057 --> 36:48.359
David was the
brother I never had.

36:48.392 --> 36:49.460
We grew up together

36:51.028 --> 36:53.097
and I will not stand by

36:53.130 --> 36:55.933
and let what was going
to be his ex-wife

36:55.966 --> 36:57.001
get away with murder.

36:58.202 --> 37:00.837
Well, I had hoped
this would have been

37:00.871 --> 37:02.572
a more pleasant visit,

37:02.605 --> 37:04.641
but I can see what
you're really after.

37:08.479 --> 37:09.346
Guess we'll see.

37:20.324 --> 37:22.126
Am I the third wheel here?

37:22.159 --> 37:23.427
Yes.

37:23.461 --> 37:24.295
No.

37:28.466 --> 37:30.468
Does it give you a rush?

37:30.501 --> 37:31.969
What?

37:32.002 --> 37:35.106
The power, having someone's
life hanging in the balance

37:35.139 --> 37:37.174
and you controlling
which way it goes.

37:39.343 --> 37:41.245
You really love
yourself, don't you?

37:42.246 --> 37:44.848
Focus here, Mr. Jenks.

37:44.882 --> 37:46.550
I wanna see my daughter.

37:46.584 --> 37:47.985
She's someplace safe.

37:48.018 --> 37:49.386
I wanna see my daughter!

37:49.420 --> 37:51.489
Relax, psycho.

37:51.522 --> 37:54.391
Psycho.

37:54.425 --> 37:56.427
I don't think I'd let
anyone get away with that.

37:56.460 --> 37:58.395
Until now.

37:58.429 --> 37:59.497
We'll see, old man.

38:00.663 --> 38:02.099
Why don't you
tell us about it?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.734
I wanna talk to Chrissy.

38:04.767 --> 38:08.305
Of course you do, but
that's not going to happen.

38:10.074 --> 38:13.244
Chrissy will never
testify against me.

38:13.277 --> 38:14.445
My daughter loves me.

38:17.148 --> 38:19.150
She loves you probably

38:19.183 --> 38:21.585
and she won't betray you.

38:21.619 --> 38:23.786
She doesn't have to.

38:23.820 --> 38:25.722
You betrayed yourself.

38:30.760 --> 38:31.929
How did I do that?

38:33.164 --> 38:35.466
Well not consciously,
but you did.

38:37.434 --> 38:39.069
All the times you hurt her,

38:40.237 --> 38:43.307
all the breaks and the
sprains, it all adds up.

38:45.609 --> 38:47.677
You're the only one
living with her.

38:48.546 --> 38:51.115
It all points to you.

38:51.148 --> 38:53.918
And yet, it's
all circumstantial.

38:55.386 --> 38:56.854
Not when Chrissy testifies.

38:58.556 --> 39:00.024
I don't need your confession.

39:03.961 --> 39:04.794
You're right.

39:06.297 --> 39:07.431
Power is a rush

39:10.367 --> 39:12.670
and I'm gonna
enjoy leveraging it

39:12.702 --> 39:16.540
and controlling which
way your life goes.

39:16.574 --> 39:17.408
Hm,

39:18.375 --> 39:20.411
you guys are all the same,

39:20.444 --> 39:23.013
read a couple fancy books
and put on some cheap suits,

39:23.047 --> 39:24.415
very cheap suits.

39:25.782 --> 39:27.717
And you think you're special,

39:27.750 --> 39:28.852
but you're nothing,

39:29.819 --> 39:31.422
nothing!

39:31.455 --> 39:33.657
My daughter will never
testify against me.

39:35.226 --> 39:36.126
Yes, she will.

39:38.028 --> 39:42.299
When I walk into that courtroom
and Chrissy sees my face,

39:44.335 --> 39:45.135
I walk.

39:47.004 --> 39:49.806
Okay, we're done here.

39:49.839 --> 39:51.075
We are done here.

39:56.380 --> 39:57.847
What do you know

39:57.881 --> 40:00.251
about the murder of
Christopher Nelson?

40:02.019 --> 40:03.420
Chris committed suicide.

40:03.454 --> 40:04.288
No.

40:05.822 --> 40:07.024
That's what they said.

40:08.092 --> 40:10.327
No he didn't and you know it.

40:10.361 --> 40:13.130
Your only option here
is to tell me the truth.

40:15.599 --> 40:16.799
I don't know anything.

40:17.935 --> 40:21.071
Kyra, you had your
chance and you blew it.

40:23.274 --> 40:25.276
You're under arrest.

40:25.309 --> 40:26.343
For murder?

40:26.377 --> 40:28.512
For obstruction of justice.

40:28.545 --> 40:31.615
You'll get a year in jail
and there goes your life.

40:33.584 --> 40:35.919
What if I told
you what I know?

40:35.953 --> 40:38.856
Or at least what they told me?

40:40.790 --> 40:42.726
I want everything.

40:42.760 --> 40:44.361
You've been told

40:45.795 --> 40:49.133
and if you hold anything
back or you're lying to me

40:49.166 --> 40:50.601
I'll lock you up.

40:54.538 --> 40:57.308
There's a pad and a pen.

40:57.341 --> 40:58.442
Start writing.

41:00.744 --> 41:01.545
Yes sir.

41:08.485 --> 41:10.788
Mickey
Young, long time no see.

41:10.820 --> 41:11.955
Christopher Nelson.

41:13.557 --> 41:15.259
So you're the
private detective.

41:17.361 --> 41:18.495
Jay Wellington,

41:20.564 --> 41:21.699
Churchill Warren

41:23.567 --> 41:24.834
and Christopher Nelson,

41:26.970 --> 41:28.539
bunch of trust-fund babies.

41:30.174 --> 41:32.576
They paid me to
investigate teachers

41:32.609 --> 41:34.878
and faculty at A.C. Prep.

41:36.046 --> 41:38.282
Well you didn't
break any laws.

41:38.315 --> 41:39.849
Christopher Nelson's death,

41:42.086 --> 41:43.654
not what I signed up for.

41:46.156 --> 41:46.990
I'm done.

41:49.360 --> 41:50.794
Retiring for good.

41:52.963 --> 41:56.700
Integrity and class,
you had it as a cop

41:56.734 --> 41:57.901
and you still have it.

42:00.070 --> 42:05.042
When I retired, the only
reason I hung up a jingle

42:06.343 --> 42:08.979
was I wanted to still be a cop.

42:10.748 --> 42:13.117
Thank you for
coming in, Mickey.

42:13.150 --> 42:15.419
I'm gonna take a
few days after this.

42:15.452 --> 42:16.587
Let's go fishing.

42:19.556 --> 42:23.794
I've been thinking about
a different type of fishing.

42:23.827 --> 42:26.430
What I've really
been wanting to do is

42:26.463 --> 42:30.000
sit down and read the Bible.

42:33.070 --> 42:34.638
I think I need some reassurance

42:34.671 --> 42:36.573
after dealing with all of this.

42:38.742 --> 42:39.576
Maybe

42:41.979 --> 42:43.580
become a fisher of men.

42:45.582 --> 42:46.984
I like that, Mickey.

42:53.690 --> 42:56.960
You're Maddie North,
teacher at A.C. Prep, correct?

42:58.362 --> 42:59.864
Was is more correct.

42:59.898 --> 43:01.131
I resigned.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.969
All I know is some students
are blackmailing teachers.

43:07.471 --> 43:09.706
Did that have anything to
do with your resignation?

43:11.876 --> 43:13.944
Is it true about the suicide?

43:15.179 --> 43:16.881
Well we're investigating that.

43:18.315 --> 43:21.185
Why don't you tell me how they
were trying to get to you?

43:24.688 --> 43:26.925
I lied on my application.

43:28.358 --> 43:32.029
I said I graduated from
Yale and that isn't true.

43:34.231 --> 43:36.834
Churchill found out about it and

43:36.868 --> 43:39.803
he told me that he and all
of his little rich buddies

43:39.837 --> 43:44.274
wanted all A's and I knew
it was just a matter of time

43:44.308 --> 43:46.443
before everyone else found out.

43:48.178 --> 43:51.014
So instead of going along
with it, I resigned.

43:53.250 --> 43:57.654
Two days later,
Christopher killed himself.

44:00.357 --> 44:01.792
That's all I know about that.

44:03.360 --> 44:07.464
My father's a minister
and I confessed to him,

44:07.498 --> 44:08.765
told him what I did and

44:10.634 --> 44:15.539
he advised me to resign and
spend some time on my knees

44:17.641 --> 44:19.009
getting some forgiveness.

44:20.377 --> 44:21.778
That's good advice.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.282
Thank you for coming
in, Miss North.

44:30.654 --> 44:31.788
I know why I'm here.

44:31.822 --> 44:32.756
Why are you here?

44:33.925 --> 44:35.092
You think I had
something to do with

44:35.125 --> 44:36.593
Chris committing suicide.

44:36.627 --> 44:40.264
Well you were his roommate
and you did find the body.

44:40.297 --> 44:41.665
We were roommates, yes,

44:41.698 --> 44:44.835
but we never really had
anything to do with each other.

44:44.869 --> 44:45.836
Nothing at all?

44:46.905 --> 44:48.672
I'm a scholarship kid.

44:48.705 --> 44:50.707
My parents don't have money.

44:50.741 --> 44:52.809
A small group of us are
in a Bible study group

44:52.843 --> 44:55.245
and we are pretty
much outsiders.

45:00.050 --> 45:03.754
We know you investigated
teachers and faculty

45:03.787 --> 45:07.758
and we know you used blackmail
and extortion to get A's.

45:07.791 --> 45:09.126
Do we need an attorney?

45:09.159 --> 45:09.961
Yes, you do.

45:09.994 --> 45:11.395
Do you want one?

45:11.428 --> 45:14.665
No, we don't believe
Chris' death was a suicide.

45:14.698 --> 45:16.366
Correct, it wasn't.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.735
We never thought it
would come to this.

45:18.769 --> 45:21.071
We think we know who did it.

45:21.104 --> 45:22.506
Let's have it.

45:22.539 --> 45:24.608
We knew that Professor Russell
was unfaithful to his wife

45:24.641 --> 45:26.143
so we squeezed him.

45:26.176 --> 45:28.345
So you think
Russell killed him?

45:29.346 --> 45:31.615
Probably Clive Barker did it.

45:31.648 --> 45:32.816
We're pretty sure.

45:32.849 --> 45:35.319
He's Professor Russell's
graduate assistant.

45:35.352 --> 45:37.588
Well how does
Russell fit in this?

45:37.621 --> 45:40.624
Clive will do whatever
the professor wants.

45:42.526 --> 45:46.030
You know you boys are still
in trouble for blackmail.

45:46.064 --> 45:48.866
Yeah, we're going
to jail, aren't we?

45:48.900 --> 45:50.701
No, your parents are rich.

45:52.569 --> 45:55.205
Their lawyers will probably
keep you out of jail.

46:00.912 --> 46:01.745
I did it.

46:03.380 --> 46:05.016
I killed Christopher Nelson.

46:05.984 --> 46:07.484
I made it look like a suicide.

46:08.552 --> 46:10.287
Why are you
confessing like this?

46:11.154 --> 46:12.689
I just wanna get it over with.

46:14.157 --> 46:18.662
Professor Russell came to
me and talked me into it.

46:20.031 --> 46:23.333
Then he started talking about
me killing the other two

46:24.534 --> 46:26.269
and I said, "No!"

46:27.504 --> 46:30.008
He threatened to
turn me in for murder

46:30.041 --> 46:33.911
and claim he knew nothing if
I didn't kill the other two.

46:33.945 --> 46:35.212
You got any proof?

46:36.647 --> 46:41.251
I have every conversation
recorded on my class recorder.

46:41.785 --> 46:42.452
You got it with ya?

46:43.687 --> 46:44.922
Absolutely.

46:44.956 --> 46:46.024
Well let's have it.

46:52.763 --> 46:54.431
I'm gonna need to keep this.

46:56.333 --> 46:57.234
Fine by me.

47:07.477 --> 47:08.311
Hey Ann.

47:10.180 --> 47:11.682
Goldie, come in.

47:14.785 --> 47:15.619
How's Devin?

47:16.787 --> 47:17.621
Better.

47:19.090 --> 47:20.524
Bill's taking him to the zoo.

47:22.259 --> 47:24.227
And what's the latest?

47:24.261 --> 47:25.762
I have custody for now.

47:26.931 --> 47:28.198
It's looking like Sissy

47:28.231 --> 47:30.333
will lose custody of
Devin permanently.

47:32.235 --> 47:36.074
My lawyer says that either
myself or my son, Frank,

47:36.107 --> 47:39.143
needs to adopt Devin
to guarantee custody.

47:41.179 --> 47:43.948
Frank wants him and I said yes.

47:45.016 --> 47:46.349
Devin likes both of his cousins

47:46.383 --> 47:47.484
so he's okay with it.

47:50.554 --> 47:51.755
Sissy's boyfriend

47:51.788 --> 47:54.624
has been convicted of
child abuse in the past.

47:54.658 --> 47:56.160
He'll go away for a long time.

47:59.830 --> 48:00.697
And Sissy?

48:01.899 --> 48:04.267
Six months in jail,
five years probation.

48:07.838 --> 48:09.907
Where did it all go wrong?

48:09.941 --> 48:11.308
I should have tried harder.

48:13.010 --> 48:13.844
Alcohol.

48:15.512 --> 48:17.547
Sissy's gonna need you
now more than ever.

48:19.117 --> 48:19.951
I'll be there.

48:21.284 --> 48:24.554
You've been snooping
around my students and Clive.

48:24.588 --> 48:25.923
What, no flirting?

48:26.924 --> 48:27.859
We got it all.

48:27.892 --> 48:30.228
You're under arrest for murder.

48:30.260 --> 48:32.696
I never came near
Christopher's room.

48:32.729 --> 48:34.331
I can prove it.

48:34.364 --> 48:36.633
You had Clive do it for you.

48:36.666 --> 48:37.902
Really?

48:37.935 --> 48:40.303
And how are you gonna
prove I did that?

48:46.743 --> 48:48.812
Clive recorded it all.

48:48.845 --> 48:49.846
You wanna hear it?

48:51.015 --> 48:52.682
No, it's not necessary.

48:54.618 --> 48:57.320
What about those boys
and what they did to me?

48:57.354 --> 49:01.159
They didn't conspire to
murder anyone, you did.

49:01.192 --> 49:03.995
If you'd only come to us
instead of killing Christopher.

49:05.529 --> 49:08.398
20 years from now, you'll
still be asking yourself,

49:08.431 --> 49:11.535
"Why did I do this
and was it worth it?"

49:14.105 --> 49:16.339
It's funny what you're
capable of, isn't it?

49:21.946 --> 49:22.980
Excuse me, boss.

49:24.714 --> 49:26.349
Ben Barnes is here to see you.

49:26.383 --> 49:28.385
He said he talked
with you this morning?

49:29.619 --> 49:30.453
Yes.

49:31.354 --> 49:33.124
The newspaper reporter.

49:36.726 --> 49:39.297
Not newspapers,
magazine articles.

49:40.497 --> 49:42.033
Right.

49:42.066 --> 49:44.467
Now tell me again
why you're here?

49:44.501 --> 49:45.402
Curiosity.

49:46.803 --> 49:48.272
I thought my readers might
wanna see what goes on

49:48.306 --> 49:50.041
in the District
Attorney's office.

49:51.708 --> 49:52.576
In what way?

49:54.245 --> 49:55.779
Cases that you're working on.

49:58.950 --> 50:01.853
Murderers, rapists,
robbers and con artists?

50:03.020 --> 50:04.688
I'm sure there's
no shortage of them.

50:06.224 --> 50:09.526
Any really unusual
or intriguing cases,

50:09.559 --> 50:12.829
stories, something that would
make my readers want more?

50:14.431 --> 50:17.034
It's not protocol
to discuss open cases.

50:17.068 --> 50:19.203
Keep the names out,
just the stories.

50:23.241 --> 50:26.143
What are you really
looking for, Mr. Barnes?

50:26.177 --> 50:27.444
Nothing specific,

50:29.046 --> 50:32.482
just any cases that tweak your
interest on a personal basis.

50:34.952 --> 50:36.753
Sorry Mr. Barnes,

50:36.786 --> 50:39.924
I think you'll have to go to
another source for inspiration.

50:39.957 --> 50:40.790
Well,

50:43.127 --> 50:45.162
I appreciate your time.

50:45.196 --> 50:46.163
Good luck to you.

50:47.932 --> 50:49.100
Evening.

50:49.133 --> 50:49.901
Evening.

50:54.205 --> 50:55.940
Who was that?

50:55.973 --> 50:57.341
Someone I don't trust.

50:58.642 --> 51:00.912
I think we need to take
a closer look at him.

51:00.945 --> 51:02.412
Why?

51:02.445 --> 51:05.216
He came in out of the
blue asking about my cases.

51:05.249 --> 51:06.918
Who do you think
he's linked to?

51:07.985 --> 51:09.619
No idea.

51:09.653 --> 51:11.155
We're handling a lot right now.

51:12.390 --> 51:13.224
Okay.

51:14.926 --> 51:16.360
Write his name down.

51:16.394 --> 51:18.728
I'll have my people
take a look at him.

51:46.290 --> 51:49.293
Hi Ace, you're early.

51:49.327 --> 51:50.727
Edie.

51:50.760 --> 51:52.897
I wish it was social.

51:54.365 --> 51:56.533
Unfortunately, it's business.

51:56.566 --> 51:58.936
I have something in the
park I have to show you.

52:00.470 --> 52:01.705
Okay,

52:01.738 --> 52:02.539
sure.

52:04.574 --> 52:06.010
Is it okay?

52:06.043 --> 52:07.744
Well, we'll see.

52:10.247 --> 52:11.781
So I'm running with
my dog this morning,

52:11.815 --> 52:13.017
you know, like I
always do, right?

52:13.050 --> 52:14.318
She breaks away from me.

52:14.352 --> 52:15.853
She never does that.

52:15.886 --> 52:18.422
She comes on over to
this area right here

52:18.456 --> 52:19.924
and starts scratching around.

52:21.591 --> 52:23.827
Looks like little tiny graves.

52:25.296 --> 52:26.130
Is that a cross?

52:28.065 --> 52:29.300
They're little bunnies.

52:31.369 --> 52:32.569
Their necks were broken.

52:34.171 --> 52:35.272
That's unbelievable.

52:39.143 --> 52:40.311
Edie, it gets worse.

52:41.678 --> 52:43.881
Yesterday, I saw Carrie

52:43.914 --> 52:46.017
and two of her friends
playing right here.

52:46.984 --> 52:49.020
Carrie, my daughter?

52:49.053 --> 52:51.288
Look, I'm a policeman.

52:51.322 --> 52:53.757
I am duty bound to report this.

52:54.992 --> 52:56.793
You don't have to do that.

52:56.826 --> 52:57.895
Well actually,

52:59.397 --> 53:00.264
Edie, I do.

53:11.275 --> 53:12.709
Hey,

53:12.742 --> 53:16.147
Mr. Ben Barnes has written
exactly one magazine article.

53:16.180 --> 53:18.182
I knew he wasn't legit.

53:18.215 --> 53:19.950
Anything else on him?

53:19.984 --> 53:22.887
He's living with an
attorney named Jovanna West.

53:22.920 --> 53:24.055
That ring a bell?

53:25.489 --> 53:27.757
Looks like Christmas is
coming early this year.

53:28.825 --> 53:30.895
We need to pick 'em both up.

53:30.928 --> 53:31.761
You got it.

53:40.004 --> 53:42.173
Are you arresting my daughter?

53:42.206 --> 53:43.773
She's 10.

53:43.807 --> 53:44.841
Excuse me?

53:46.010 --> 53:48.845
Look, I know these
girls did a bad thing,

53:48.879 --> 53:50.247
but why all this?

53:50.281 --> 53:52.083
Don't you think
this is a bit much?

53:52.116 --> 53:54.485
Mrs. James, acts of this nature

53:54.518 --> 53:57.154
are an indication of
very disturbed behavior.

53:57.188 --> 53:58.621
If we ignore this,

53:58.655 --> 54:01.724
we could be creating a far
worse situation in the future.

54:01.758 --> 54:02.927
We just wanna
make sure the girls

54:02.960 --> 54:04.761
get the proper care
that they need.

54:04.794 --> 54:06.663
Excuse me, who are you?

54:06.696 --> 54:09.133
This is child
psychologist, Marsha Collins.

54:09.166 --> 54:11.969
She and I will be conducting
the interviews with the girls.

54:13.437 --> 54:14.338
It's gonna be okay.

54:14.371 --> 54:15.339
Don't touch me!

54:16.340 --> 54:17.174
Really?

54:25.282 --> 54:26.649
You're under arrest.

54:27.852 --> 54:31.021
For what, asking questions?

54:31.055 --> 54:33.390
I haven't done anything illegal.

54:33.424 --> 54:34.824
Well, for starters,

54:34.859 --> 54:38.095
my favorite catch-all charge,
obstruction of justice.

54:39.829 --> 54:41.232
We'll add the rest later.

54:42.600 --> 54:44.268
You're not talking
your way out of this one.

54:44.301 --> 54:46.003
Jovanna's done either way.

54:48.239 --> 54:50.875
The only uncertainty
here is you.

54:50.908 --> 54:53.144
Your loyalty to her
will only result

54:53.177 --> 54:55.012
in a very long prison sentence.

54:55.913 --> 54:57.281
You were serious then?

54:58.315 --> 54:59.950
It is a murder, for real.

55:01.152 --> 55:01.986
Yes.

55:05.890 --> 55:08.292
Jovanna said her husband
died of an accident

55:09.593 --> 55:11.728
and that you're trying
to frame her for it.

55:13.130 --> 55:15.599
She asked me to try and find
out what you had on her.

55:16.934 --> 55:18.369
Not good enough.

55:18.402 --> 55:20.204
You're not a
convincing enough liar.

55:21.605 --> 55:23.706
Now come clean or you're
going away for a long time.

55:25.675 --> 55:26.776
I'm caught up in
something and now

55:26.809 --> 55:29.079
I'm going to go to jail for it?

55:29.113 --> 55:31.315
Well you're only
chance is to talk to us.

55:33.450 --> 55:34.717
What do you wanna know?

55:36.753 --> 55:37.655
Everything.

55:42.560 --> 55:44.228
Where in the world
have you two been?

55:44.261 --> 55:45.828
Just walking around.

55:45.863 --> 55:47.264
You're out walking around

55:47.298 --> 55:49.133
while there's still
chores waiting to be done!

55:49.166 --> 55:50.868
I did the laundry and
Jenny cleaned the kitchen.

55:50.901 --> 55:52.002
Take a look.

55:52.036 --> 55:53.736
The kitchen floor's filthy!

55:53.770 --> 55:54.672
Mop it!

55:54.704 --> 55:56.739
Jenny mopped it this morning!

55:56.773 --> 56:00.911
Well if it's so clean why
don't you eat off of it?

56:02.980 --> 56:06.016
Dinner is served, you ingrates.

56:06.050 --> 56:07.618
Fine, we'll mop it.

56:09.019 --> 56:12.590
By the way, your 18th birthday
is at the end of the month.

56:12.623 --> 56:14.791
You're gonna have to
find a new place to live.

56:14.824 --> 56:16.260
Happy birthday.

56:18.128 --> 56:22.132
Jenny, you'll be getting a
new brother and sister soon.

56:24.767 --> 56:25.970
It'll be okay.

56:31.741 --> 56:35.379
Mr. Mear, someone just came
in that I need to talk to.

56:35.412 --> 56:36.413
Can I call you back?

56:39.149 --> 56:39.984
Chrissy.

56:42.419 --> 56:43.520
Great to see you.

56:46.657 --> 56:48.092
You look good.

56:48.125 --> 56:50.227
Thank you, I feel good.

56:52.129 --> 56:54.365
You must be Chrissy's aunt.

56:54.398 --> 56:56.166
Yes, I'm Mona Jenks.

56:57.834 --> 56:59.069
I got a call from the office

56:59.103 --> 57:01.438
saying I should come in
and sign some paperwork.

57:02.606 --> 57:04.742
Yes we typed up
your statements

57:04.807 --> 57:06.343
and just need you to sign them.

57:07.511 --> 57:10.281
I'm so sorry Chrissy
had to endure this.

57:11.515 --> 57:15.818
I had no idea my brother
was capable of this.

57:15.853 --> 57:17.554
Janet, can you come in here?

57:20.024 --> 57:22.960
Chrissy, Janet will take
you to sign the papers.

57:22.993 --> 57:23.826
Okay.

57:31.935 --> 57:34.204
You expect me to
believe that load?

57:34.238 --> 57:35.472
Load?

57:35.506 --> 57:36.507
What do you mean?

57:37.675 --> 57:39.710
Robert Jenks didn't
just wake up one morning

57:39.743 --> 57:42.479
and decide to become
an abusive psychopath.

57:42.513 --> 57:43.747
That's ingrained.

57:43.781 --> 57:44.615
It's genetic.

57:46.483 --> 57:47.785
That's years of escalating

57:47.817 --> 57:49.720
from one violent
moment to the next.

57:50.988 --> 57:52.389
You can't sit here and
expect me to believe

57:52.423 --> 57:53.757
you didn't see that.

57:57.061 --> 58:00.597
In fact, I'm sure you
experienced it first hand,

58:01.732 --> 58:03.167
didn't you?

58:03.200 --> 58:04.435
I didn't.

58:04.468 --> 58:06.537
Come on, find some
guts for your niece

58:06.570 --> 58:08.439
and at least tell me the truth.

58:08.472 --> 58:10.007
What'd he do, huh?

58:10.040 --> 58:11.208
Yell at you?

58:11.241 --> 58:12.876
- Throw things at you?
- Stop.

58:12.910 --> 58:13.977
Kick you?

58:14.011 --> 58:14.844
Yes.

58:16.814 --> 58:19.316
All of the above and more.

58:19.350 --> 58:21.051
He hit me a lot.

58:22.619 --> 58:26.056
At first it was the getting
mad and throwing things

58:27.391 --> 58:30.894
and then one day
when he was six,

58:30.928 --> 58:33.664
he hit me when I
went into his room.

58:33.697 --> 58:35.733
I was just looking
at one of his toys.

58:36.934 --> 58:39.069
All I did was pick the
toy up to look at it.

58:40.537 --> 58:42.606
That's why you live on the
other side of the country,

58:42.639 --> 58:44.742
right, to get away from him?

58:46.543 --> 58:48.979
But you left your niece
here to deal with him.

58:49.012 --> 58:50.848
You must think I'm horrible,

58:52.950 --> 58:54.351
but not anymore.

59:00.391 --> 59:01.558
I think you two

59:01.592 --> 59:03.293
should head into the
conference room to chat.

59:12.102 --> 59:14.905
Did he tell you that
you are worthless?

59:17.007 --> 59:19.943
Twist your arm so hard
you couldn't breath?

59:21.178 --> 59:22.112
How did you know?

59:25.149 --> 59:26.851
Oh, Aunt Mona, you too?

59:29.052 --> 59:30.354
I'm sorry.

59:31.822 --> 59:35.559
I should never have
left you here to suffer.

59:37.361 --> 59:40.264
I was so scared he
was going to kill me,

59:40.297 --> 59:42.065
I ran as far away as I could.

59:42.099 --> 59:42.933
Stop.

59:44.067 --> 59:44.903
It's over.

59:46.804 --> 59:48.105
You don't have to explain.

59:50.574 --> 59:52.509
You know, I can't even
remember being angry with him

59:52.543 --> 59:53.377
for what he did.

59:55.612 --> 59:57.948
I just remember
telling myself that

59:57.981 --> 59:59.983
if I could just do
better and make sure

01:00:00.017 --> 01:00:05.022
everything was perfect,
then that day would be okay.

01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:09.493
It's going to feel strange

01:00:10.895 --> 01:00:13.230
making it through a
day without worrying,

01:00:16.767 --> 01:00:17.768
but eventually,

01:00:19.136 --> 01:00:20.504
you'll regain yourself

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.309
and I'll be there to help you

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:28.645
if you want me to be there.

01:00:31.148 --> 01:00:33.016
Is there a church
where you live?

01:00:34.618 --> 01:00:38.188
There's a beautiful little
church I've been attending.

01:00:38.222 --> 01:00:39.389
I'd love to take you.

01:00:41.058 --> 01:00:44.127
I went with my friend to
hers and really enjoyed it.

01:00:44.161 --> 01:00:47.431
The music was beautiful
and so comforting.

01:00:50.534 --> 01:00:52.369
Chrissy, I became a Christian

01:00:53.604 --> 01:00:55.772
and it has brought
peace into my life.

01:00:59.309 --> 01:01:00.879
I don't know what that's like.

01:01:01.946 --> 01:01:02.713
Peace.

01:01:04.949 --> 01:01:06.985
All I know is I
wanna fill this hole

01:01:07.017 --> 01:01:08.285
that's inside of my heart.

01:01:10.387 --> 01:01:11.555
You'll have it.

01:01:12.723 --> 01:01:16.226
We'll go see my pastor
as soon as we get home.

01:01:17.327 --> 01:01:18.161
Home,

01:01:19.563 --> 01:01:20.965
that's all I ever wanted.

01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:27.170
Where have you been?

01:01:27.204 --> 01:01:29.506
I have been waiting forever.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.375
All right, all
right, I'm here now.

01:01:31.408 --> 01:01:32.209
Let's do this.

01:01:32.242 --> 01:01:33.043
Did you wash your hands?

01:01:33.076 --> 01:01:34.311
Yep.

01:01:34.344 --> 01:01:36.780
Good, okay, start with
a teaspoon of that one.

01:01:39.249 --> 01:01:41.351
Good, now just a pinch of that.

01:01:43.554 --> 01:01:48.091
Jack, please promise me you
won't leave me here by myself.

01:01:48.125 --> 01:01:49.393
Yeah, yeah, I promise.

01:01:49.426 --> 01:01:50.494
I'm serious.

01:01:52.229 --> 01:01:54.831
I have no intentions of
leaving you here with her.

01:01:56.034 --> 01:01:57.701
Who are we going
to try this on?

01:02:01.138 --> 01:02:02.040
I have an idea.

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:07.277
Are you Detective Daniels?

01:02:08.445 --> 01:02:10.113
Yes, I am.

01:02:10.147 --> 01:02:12.884
My name is Watts, Moses Watts.

01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:13.918
I'm here to report,

01:02:16.286 --> 01:02:17.754
I killed my wife.

01:02:19.523 --> 01:02:23.895
Uh, Mr. Watts, are you
any relation to Sara Watts

01:02:23.928 --> 01:02:25.964
of the District
Attorney's office?

01:02:25.997 --> 01:02:28.632
Yes, she's my granddaughter.

01:02:28.665 --> 01:02:31.635
She's a lawyer and
a Harvard graduate.

01:02:32.803 --> 01:02:37.474
Okay Mr. Watts, don't
say anything more.

01:02:37.507 --> 01:02:40.210
Come with me in
my office, please.

01:02:49.252 --> 01:02:50.922
Hey, you got here fast.

01:02:50.955 --> 01:02:52.389
How did he get here?

01:02:52.422 --> 01:02:55.927
Well he just uh, he
came into the parking lot,

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.029
asked me if I was
Detective Daniels

01:02:58.062 --> 01:03:01.065
and told me he
murdered his wife.

01:03:01.099 --> 01:03:03.400
My grandmother
passed away last month.

01:03:03.433 --> 01:03:04.601
How old is he?

01:03:04.635 --> 01:03:05.435
He's 78.

01:03:07.071 --> 01:03:10.041
Well I told him not to
say anything and called you.

01:03:10.074 --> 01:03:10.875
Thank you, Bill.

01:03:10.908 --> 01:03:12.342
He's an honorable man.

01:03:12.376 --> 01:03:13.644
Let's get to it, shall we?

01:03:13.677 --> 01:03:15.278
Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:21.318 --> 01:03:24.055
Poppy, Detective
Daniels tells me

01:03:24.088 --> 01:03:26.090
you were saying
you killed grammy.

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:28.059
I did.

01:03:28.092 --> 01:03:29.559
Grammy had cancer.

01:03:29.593 --> 01:03:31.695
She died in her sleep, right?

01:03:31.728 --> 01:03:33.363
She was in so much pain.

01:03:34.231 --> 01:03:35.198
She wanted to die.

01:03:36.366 --> 01:03:37.969
She asked me to get
a morphine bottle

01:03:38.002 --> 01:03:39.803
and set it next to the bed,

01:03:40.972 --> 01:03:42.639
with a glass of
her favorite wine.

01:03:44.909 --> 01:03:49.446
I told her I love her,
couldn't, but she begged me.

01:03:49.479 --> 01:03:50.681
I couldn't say no.

01:03:52.582 --> 01:03:54.685
I did what she asked.

01:03:54.718 --> 01:03:56.486
Did you help her
take the pills?

01:03:57.721 --> 01:03:59.957
No, I took the bottle,

01:03:59.991 --> 01:04:03.094
set it on the end table along
with a glass of Chablis.

01:04:04.528 --> 01:04:07.464
She asked me to
go to the kitchen,

01:04:07.497 --> 01:04:11.601
pour me a glass and wait
until she called me.

01:04:11.635 --> 01:04:13.004
I did what she asked.

01:04:14.972 --> 01:04:18.475
She called for me and
I took my glass with me

01:04:18.508 --> 01:04:23.313
and sat on a chair next to
the bed, sipped my wine.

01:04:24.648 --> 01:04:29.453
She said she loved me,

01:04:32.622 --> 01:04:37.627
closed her
eyes and went to sleep.

01:04:40.363 --> 01:04:43.700
Oh Poppy, that must
have been very difficult.

01:04:47.404 --> 01:04:48.839
You're not mad at me?

01:04:50.841 --> 01:04:52.642
I thought you would hate me.

01:04:52.676 --> 01:04:54.145
No Poppy, I don't hate you.

01:04:55.512 --> 01:04:59.984
Mr. Watts, let your
granddaughter take you home.

01:05:02.086 --> 01:05:03.453
I broke the law.

01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:09.793
I helped her to end her life.

01:05:12.295 --> 01:05:14.297
She never told
you her intentions.

01:05:14.331 --> 01:05:19.336
A good lawyer will just argue
she was taking a normal dose.

01:05:20.071 --> 01:05:21.671
Go home, Mr. Watts.

01:05:21.705 --> 01:05:22.907
He's right,

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:25.575
I don't see 12 people on
a jury convicting you.

01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:27.310
You did the right
thing coming here.

01:05:27.344 --> 01:05:28.378
You reported it.

01:05:30.181 --> 01:05:34.152
What I did I know is not
right in the laws of God or man.

01:05:37.955 --> 01:05:39.556
I knew what she was going to do.

01:05:43.426 --> 01:05:45.395
You think the Lord
will forgive me?

01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:50.300
If you're truly repentant
and you seem to be.

01:06:00.878 --> 01:06:03.847
Jack, fix me a
drink, you know,

01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:06.050
the pink one I like
in the evening.

01:06:06.951 --> 01:06:07.885
Absolutely.

01:06:11.122 --> 01:06:11.989
Coming right up.

01:06:23.868 --> 01:06:24.969
Yes ma'am,

01:06:26.137 --> 01:06:30.607
one pink drink just for you.

01:06:47.424 --> 01:06:48.558
Cory's here.

01:06:52.362 --> 01:06:53.965
Good afternoon, ladies.

01:06:53.998 --> 01:06:55.565
Who's hungry?

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:58.535
I'll have a turkey with
Cheddar wrap, please.

01:06:58.568 --> 01:06:59.836
Mmhmm.

01:07:01.038 --> 01:07:02.139
- Here you go.
- Thank you

01:07:02.173 --> 01:07:03.875
Cora, didn't I ask you

01:07:03.908 --> 01:07:06.310
not to bring anymore
of those brownies?

01:07:06.344 --> 01:07:08.812
I'm gonna gain 10
pounds just on brownies.

01:07:08.845 --> 01:07:10.047
You'll be fine, dear,

01:07:10.081 --> 01:07:12.716
just run an extra three
miles in the morning.

01:07:14.551 --> 01:07:16.053
I'll have the ham and Swiss.

01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:22.559
And a brownie.

01:07:25.629 --> 01:07:26.463
Gimme two.

01:07:29.901 --> 01:07:32.103
I'll put it on
your tab, ladies.

01:07:33.104 --> 01:07:34.071
Bye Cora.

01:07:45.917 --> 01:07:47.784
I don't like this at all.

01:07:47.817 --> 01:07:49.186
This is my case.

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.553
I developed all the evidence,

01:07:50.587 --> 01:07:53.556
I should be the only
one to question Gage.

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:55.492
Of course I want you
in on the questioning,

01:07:55.525 --> 01:07:57.661
but I need the first
team in its entirety.

01:07:57.694 --> 01:08:00.031
That includes you,
but also Daniels.

01:08:00.064 --> 01:08:01.631
He's the best we have.

01:08:01.665 --> 01:08:03.167
I don't agree.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.735
Look, I'm a lieutenant.

01:08:05.769 --> 01:08:08.139
He's been doing
this for 40 years

01:08:08.172 --> 01:08:10.074
and he's still just a detective.

01:08:10.107 --> 01:08:12.009
Wrong, it's actually
Captain Daniels.

01:08:12.043 --> 01:08:13.411
Don't, Ann.

01:08:13.443 --> 01:08:15.212
Captain what?

01:08:15.246 --> 01:08:18.082
Daniels has been getting
promoted all along.

01:08:18.115 --> 01:08:20.318
That's why he's in charge
of the interrogation unit.

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:21.252
He outranks you.

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:23.787
I don't get it.

01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:24.988
It's really simple,

01:08:25.022 --> 01:08:26.991
I don't want criminals
I'm investigating

01:08:27.024 --> 01:08:29.725
to know I have any authority.

01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:33.096
You can take the lead here,
I'll take second chair.

01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:36.133
All right, but three's
too many in there.

01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:38.002
Fine, I'll just watch.

01:08:44.975 --> 01:08:49.246
Gage, you have been
conning elderly people

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:51.648
out of their retirement
savings way too long.

01:08:52.816 --> 01:08:55.152
Well, I don't see it that way.

01:08:56.618 --> 01:09:00.057
I'm an investment advisor
and it's perfectly legal.

01:09:01.491 --> 01:09:04.493
Then why is it I have over
200 complaints on my desk

01:09:05.828 --> 01:09:08.265
claiming that you've
been conning them?

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:15.038
Okay, I made some investments
that didn't work out,

01:09:15.772 --> 01:09:17.441
but it's not illegal.

01:09:17.475 --> 01:09:19.310
I'm not Bernie Madoff.

01:09:19.343 --> 01:09:21.511
He just took people's money.

01:09:21.544 --> 01:09:26.549
I have invested every dime
investors have given to me,

01:09:28.285 --> 01:09:29.987
every single dime.

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.924
Correct, but losing
money on paper.

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.229
But I've traced the money
coming out of the back door

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:39.997
into the account
of James Lester.

01:09:41.265 --> 01:09:44.969
I never heard of
any James Lester.

01:09:45.002 --> 01:09:46.103
That's doesn't ring a bell?

01:09:46.136 --> 01:09:48.005
No, it doesn't ring a bell.

01:09:48.038 --> 01:09:49.974
James Lester's your real name.

01:09:50.006 --> 01:09:50.975
No, it's not.

01:09:51.008 --> 01:09:53.542
One in Pomona, California,

01:09:53.576 --> 01:09:57.248
served time for pulling
the same con in Arizona.

01:09:57.281 --> 01:10:02.153
I know nothing
about any bank account

01:10:02.186 --> 01:10:04.288
under the name of James Lester.

01:10:07.425 --> 01:10:11.594
Well don't worry about
it, James Lester's broke.

01:10:11.628 --> 01:10:14.532
We seized all the money in
the account this morning.

01:10:14.564 --> 01:10:15.533
What?

01:10:15.565 --> 01:10:18.235
No, you can't do
that, you can't.

01:10:18.269 --> 01:10:19.569
We can and we did.

01:10:21.472 --> 01:10:24.942
We got it all, all 18,000,000.

01:10:24.975 --> 01:10:28.913
It's 18,249,000 to be exact.

01:10:30.381 --> 01:10:31.648
You are a miser.

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:36.253
You took the money, but
unlike other crooks,

01:10:36.287 --> 01:10:37.221
you never blew it.

01:10:42.426 --> 01:10:46.629
It was never about the money.

01:10:48.099 --> 01:10:49.467
It was about the con game.

01:10:51.368 --> 01:10:53.304
Yeah, well it
looks like everyone

01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:55.439
will pretty much get
all their money back.

01:10:59.642 --> 01:11:02.413
I think I'm gonna
be sick.

01:11:02.446 --> 01:11:06.984
Do us a favor, wait 'til
you get back to your cell.

01:11:07.017 --> 01:11:08.119
Nice work.

01:11:10.287 --> 01:11:11.355
Thanks, Captain.

01:11:12.655 --> 01:11:13.557
Can I go now?

01:11:14.992 --> 01:11:18.062
No you're gonna sit here
and think about what you did

01:11:18.095 --> 01:11:19.597
and don't get my table dirty.

01:11:25.269 --> 01:11:26.103
What?

01:11:27.238 --> 01:11:29.940
I know I'm asking this
a lot, but you okay?

01:11:30.875 --> 01:11:32.742
I'm tired.

01:11:32.775 --> 01:11:33.843
It's never gonna end.

01:11:33.878 --> 01:11:35.778
I feel like I'm in a tidal wave.

01:11:36.646 --> 01:11:39.016
The bad guys just keep coming.

01:11:39.984 --> 01:11:41.452
Are we making any difference?

01:11:43.287 --> 01:11:44.121
We are.

01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:05.242
Jack, this is D.A. Walker
and I'm Detective Daniels

01:12:06.776 --> 01:12:08.711
and we're sorry for your loss.

01:12:11.681 --> 01:12:12.449
Thank you.

01:12:15.386 --> 01:12:17.221
You found any leads?

01:12:17.254 --> 01:12:18.755
Oh, it's too soon to tell.

01:12:20.591 --> 01:12:24.662
I'm sorry, but we need to
ask you some questions.

01:12:25.828 --> 01:12:28.566
Absolutely, any
way I can help.

01:12:29.732 --> 01:12:31.734
Where were you
between the hours

01:12:31.768 --> 01:12:34.672
of 2:00 p.m. and
5:00 p.m. yesterday?

01:12:34.704 --> 01:12:37.707
Uh, I was at the movies
with my sister, Jenny.

01:12:39.677 --> 01:12:41.612
Anyone who can verify that?

01:12:42.745 --> 01:12:45.848
Yeah, the girl behind
the counter, Nicole.

01:12:45.883 --> 01:12:47.885
I spoke to her
for a few minutes.

01:12:47.918 --> 01:12:52.122
Do you know anyone who
might wanna hurt Edith?

01:12:53.524 --> 01:12:55.526
No.

01:12:55.559 --> 01:12:57.394
No.

01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:03.968
I sure hope you
catch who did this.

01:13:04.001 --> 01:13:07.671
All right, stay close,

01:13:07.705 --> 01:13:09.940
we may need to ask you
some more questions.

01:13:11.408 --> 01:13:12.176
Sure.

01:13:13.577 --> 01:13:15.879
If there's anything I
can do, just let me know.

01:13:15.913 --> 01:13:16.746
Thank you.

01:13:33.264 --> 01:13:36.734
Hi Jenny, I'm Detective Daniels.

01:13:36.766 --> 01:13:37.601
Hi.

01:13:40.037 --> 01:13:42.373
Jenny, I'm sorry about Edith.

01:13:43.507 --> 01:13:44.774
Me too.

01:13:44.807 --> 01:13:47.745
I have to ask you
a few questions.

01:13:47.777 --> 01:13:51.282
Were you at the movies
with your brother

01:13:51.315 --> 01:13:53.751
at around 2:00 to
5:00 p.m. yesterday?

01:13:54.885 --> 01:13:56.053
Yeah.

01:13:56.086 --> 01:13:59.223
Did you hear anyone
she got upset with

01:13:59.256 --> 01:14:04.061
or anyone that argued
with her or yelled at her?

01:14:05.529 --> 01:14:08.732
No, but I spent a lot of
time at my friend's house.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.871
Okay Jenny, thank you for
answering a few questions

01:14:13.904 --> 01:14:16.907
and you can go back outside
with your brother now.

01:14:18.976 --> 01:14:21.478
Oh, thank you for
coming Agent Fisher.

01:14:21.512 --> 01:14:22.980
Thanks for the head's up.

01:14:23.013 --> 01:14:26.950
Yeah, this is our Russian
translator, Josefina Hoffman.

01:14:26.984 --> 01:14:28.419
Ma'am.

01:14:28.452 --> 01:14:30.220
So, what do we have?

01:14:30.254 --> 01:14:34.058
Well that's Olga Azarov Lewis.

01:14:34.091 --> 01:14:36.093
She reported her
husband missing.

01:14:36.126 --> 01:14:38.629
He's been gone about 36 hours.

01:14:39.763 --> 01:14:42.199
Any evidence she
did something to him?

01:14:42.232 --> 01:14:44.568
Well we're still
processing the house.

01:14:44.601 --> 01:14:46.937
We haven't found any
witnesses to talk to.

01:14:48.305 --> 01:14:49.139
You won't.

01:14:51.775 --> 01:14:55.212
That's her lawyer,
Mark Andreyev.

01:14:55.245 --> 01:14:57.247
He's a fun one, good luck.

01:15:08.492 --> 01:15:10.928
Hello, I'm Agent
Fisher with INS.

01:15:10.961 --> 01:15:12.896
This is Officer Hoffman.

01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:15.165
You should be out
looking for my husband,

01:15:15.199 --> 01:15:17.101
not sitting here questioning me.

01:15:18.569 --> 01:15:21.271
It's my understanding local
law enforcement is doing that.

01:15:21.305 --> 01:15:23.874
All right, let's
get this over with.

01:15:23.907 --> 01:15:25.609
How long were you married?

01:15:25.642 --> 01:15:27.378
14 months.

01:15:27.411 --> 01:15:28.579
Were you happy?

01:15:28.612 --> 01:15:29.480
Yes.

01:15:31.648 --> 01:15:33.250
How happy?

01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:35.285
Happy as any other couple.

01:15:35.319 --> 01:15:36.687
Why did you wait so long

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.089
to report your husband
missing Mrs. Lewis?

01:15:40.324 --> 01:15:42.826
Sometimes he would
go fishing or hunting

01:15:42.861 --> 01:15:45.429
and would be gone for a day.

01:15:45.462 --> 01:15:49.533
Usually he tells me, but
this time, he just didn't.

01:15:49.566 --> 01:15:51.168
Your statement says
you were home alone

01:15:51.201 --> 01:15:53.137
'til you went to
the store yesterday.

01:15:54.037 --> 01:15:56.240
No friends over, just you?

01:15:56.273 --> 01:15:57.107
Just me.

01:15:58.275 --> 01:16:00.177
Do you have any
friends, Mrs. Lewis?

01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:01.812
No, not really.

01:16:02.946 --> 01:16:04.648
You know, it's hard
to make friends

01:16:04.681 --> 01:16:06.383
when you are from
another country.

01:16:07.484 --> 01:16:09.486
Your bracelet
looks really unusual.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.521
Is that from Russia?

01:16:11.588 --> 01:16:12.356
Yes.

01:16:14.024 --> 01:16:17.327
Mrs. Lewis, would you mind
rolling your sleeves up for me?

01:16:17.361 --> 01:16:18.729
Why does she need to do that?

01:16:18.762 --> 01:16:19.763
Curiosity.

01:16:38.715 --> 01:16:39.884
Your husband beat
you, didn't he?

01:16:39.918 --> 01:16:42.887
Nope, she fell.

01:16:42.921 --> 01:16:43.821
She's clumsy.

01:16:46.290 --> 01:16:47.491
I guess we're done here.

01:16:50.828 --> 01:16:51.762
Don't leave town.

01:17:07.778 --> 01:17:09.246
Well, that went nowhere.

01:17:09.279 --> 01:17:12.182
Their little sidebar, she
didn't wanna show her arms,

01:17:12.216 --> 01:17:14.718
but the lawyer said she'd
looks suspicious if she didn't.

01:17:14.751 --> 01:17:17.421
He knew we're not gonna
get anywhere with it.

01:17:17.454 --> 01:17:20.757
And he's correct, without
a body or more evidence,

01:17:20.791 --> 01:17:23.827
we're done and her
lawyer knows it.

01:17:25.964 --> 01:17:27.998
So, where are we?

01:17:28.031 --> 01:17:29.833
Will's with toxicology.

01:17:29.868 --> 01:17:33.103
He's a leading expert on
naturally occurring poisons.

01:17:33.136 --> 01:17:34.605
Naturally occurring?

01:17:34.638 --> 01:17:37.307
Yes, this person must have
a fairly strong understanding

01:17:37.341 --> 01:17:39.510
of herbs and flowers and
what could be combined

01:17:39.543 --> 01:17:41.111
to create a poison.

01:17:41.144 --> 01:17:44.548
Okay so who are we
looking for, a botanist?

01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:46.550
Maybe, but not necessarily.

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:49.019
All the components can
easily be found online.

01:17:49.052 --> 01:17:50.487
Even someone with no experience

01:17:50.521 --> 01:17:52.857
is capable of
compounding a poison.

01:17:52.891 --> 01:17:55.025
We're almost done
analyzing the components

01:17:55.058 --> 01:17:58.228
and we should have a report
to you by the end of the day.

01:17:58.262 --> 01:18:00.531
Your victim was
poisoned and beaten.

01:18:00.564 --> 01:18:01.732
The perp most likely

01:18:01.765 --> 01:18:03.868
didn't wanna wait on
the herbs to do the job.

01:18:03.902 --> 01:18:06.403
Had to be someone with
a whole lot of anger.

01:18:06.436 --> 01:18:08.940
Oh, and that partial
print you wanted me to run,

01:18:10.374 --> 01:18:14.745
it wasn't a partial, it was a
full fingerprint of a child,

01:18:14.778 --> 01:18:18.749
I'd say between nine
and 12 years old.

01:18:18.782 --> 01:18:19.616
Interesting.

01:18:21.485 --> 01:18:23.287
I hope it's not who
I'm thinking of.

01:18:26.523 --> 01:18:28.492
Kerry, do you know
why you're here?

01:18:28.525 --> 01:18:29.326
No.

01:18:31.562 --> 01:18:32.829
We found some graves.

01:18:34.097 --> 01:18:37.035
Looks like bunnies
were killed and buried.

01:18:37.936 --> 01:18:39.703
We found those.

01:18:39.736 --> 01:18:42.239
We didn't have anything
to do with killing them.

01:18:45.442 --> 01:18:47.444
Okay, do you know who did?

01:18:48.913 --> 01:18:49.746
No.

01:18:50.882 --> 01:18:51.715
Okay.

01:18:53.051 --> 01:18:55.152
We're gonna have to
talk to the other two.

01:18:56.453 --> 01:18:59.023
Are you sure this is
all you wanna say?

01:18:59.057 --> 01:18:59.891
Yup.

01:19:02.492 --> 01:19:04.328
Okay, back outside.

01:19:07.464 --> 01:19:09.499
Do you know why you're here?

01:19:09.533 --> 01:19:11.735
Because of the bunny graves?

01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:14.939
Did you kill the bunnies?

01:19:14.973 --> 01:19:18.108
No, we just found the graves.

01:19:18.141 --> 01:19:19.409
We didn't do anything.

01:19:20.644 --> 01:19:21.946
You just found them?

01:19:23.915 --> 01:19:26.050
Okay, send in Maria.

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.688
I know Kerry's the alpha.

01:19:31.722 --> 01:19:32.656
The what?

01:19:33.858 --> 01:19:36.360
The alpha, the leader
of your little group.

01:19:37.895 --> 01:19:39.563
You seem like the
reasonable one.

01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:42.399
Tell me what happened.

01:19:42.432 --> 01:19:44.969
We just found the graves.

01:19:45.003 --> 01:19:46.037
Did you dig one up?

01:19:48.138 --> 01:19:49.773
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

01:19:49.806 --> 01:19:51.675
You did or you didn't.

01:19:51.708 --> 01:19:52.542
Yes.

01:19:54.211 --> 01:19:56.647
And what did you do with
it once you dug it up?

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.781
Buried it again.

01:20:02.854 --> 01:20:04.889
Do you know who
killed the bunnies?

01:20:04.922 --> 01:20:06.090
No.

01:20:06.124 --> 01:20:08.825
Okay, Maria, wait
outside please.

01:20:13.263 --> 01:20:14.264
You see what I see?

01:20:15.332 --> 01:20:16.233
They're a pretty tight group,

01:20:16.266 --> 01:20:18.769
got their stories all lining up.

01:20:18.802 --> 01:20:21.973
Should we do this as
a group or each one?

01:20:22.006 --> 01:20:24.441
Group, but I think
the focus needs to be

01:20:24.474 --> 01:20:26.077
put primarily on Kerry.

01:20:28.512 --> 01:20:30.747
Why don't you
handle this round.

01:20:30.781 --> 01:20:31.615
Okay.

01:20:33.918 --> 01:20:36.988
Hi girls, my name
is Dr. Collins.

01:20:37.021 --> 01:20:39.356
I know this is all
a bit overwhelming

01:20:39.389 --> 01:20:40.892
so we'll try to keep it brief.

01:20:42.325 --> 01:20:44.896
Who can tell me who was the
first one to find the graves?

01:20:44.929 --> 01:20:46.530
I did.

01:20:46.563 --> 01:20:48.565
And when was that?

01:20:48.598 --> 01:20:52.036
I don't know, maybe
a couple weeks ago.

01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:57.607
And so you were showing
the graves to Maria and Rosa?

01:20:57.641 --> 01:20:58.943
Yes.

01:20:58.976 --> 01:20:59.776
Why?

01:21:01.778 --> 01:21:04.548
I don't know, guess
I thought it was cool.

01:21:06.017 --> 01:21:07.718
You didn't think to tell
your parents about them?

01:21:08.886 --> 01:21:11.122
No, I know what
goes on in the world,

01:21:11.155 --> 01:21:12.389
I can handle it.

01:21:14.158 --> 01:21:16.460
You seem like you're
mature for your age.

01:21:17.929 --> 01:21:19.429
We have a witness that says
you've been going back there

01:21:19.463 --> 01:21:20.697
for about two months.

01:21:20.731 --> 01:21:23.266
So a couple of weeks
ago is not accurate.

01:21:25.002 --> 01:21:27.071
It's better you tell
us now what happened

01:21:27.105 --> 01:21:30.440
rather than us piecing
the puzzle together later.

01:21:30.474 --> 01:21:32.242
It was an initiation.

01:21:32.275 --> 01:21:33.710
Shut up!

01:21:33.744 --> 01:21:35.712
It's over, they're
going to figure it out.

01:21:35.746 --> 01:21:37.115
She made us do it!

01:21:37.148 --> 01:21:38.782
Shut up, both of you!

01:21:40.151 --> 01:21:41.651
An initiation for what?

01:21:43.087 --> 01:21:47.758
To join the group, we
each had to kill a bunny.

01:21:48.625 --> 01:21:50.727
I'm still having nightmares.

01:21:50.761 --> 01:21:52.163
There are five graves.

01:21:52.196 --> 01:21:54.165
How many people
are in this group?

01:21:54.198 --> 01:21:54.999
Just us.

01:21:56.868 --> 01:21:59.569
So who killed the
other two bunnies?

01:22:02.305 --> 01:22:03.807
Who put the cross on the grave?

01:22:05.442 --> 01:22:06.244
I did.

01:22:08.745 --> 01:22:09.546
Okay.

01:22:11.348 --> 01:22:13.184
I'll be talking with
your parents next.

01:22:14.185 --> 01:22:15.019
Stay here.

01:22:24.128 --> 01:22:26.797
You can drop the innocent act.

01:22:27.798 --> 01:22:29.200
It took you long enough.

01:22:29.233 --> 01:22:32.569
I started to think that I would
actually get away with it.

01:22:32.602 --> 01:22:36.606
Started thinking about
who would be next.

01:22:38.876 --> 01:22:40.477
What happened?

01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:42.180
You're smart, real smart.

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.782
You could've done anything.

01:22:45.816 --> 01:22:47.185
What kind of
people do you think

01:22:47.218 --> 01:22:49.452
makes something of
themselves in this world?

01:22:51.222 --> 01:22:52.290
The people like me

01:22:53.690 --> 01:22:56.027
or the kind that lives in
big cities with rich parents?

01:22:58.062 --> 01:22:58.896
Why Edith?

01:22:59.997 --> 01:23:01.132
She took care of you.

01:23:02.133 --> 01:23:04.001
Yeah right,

01:23:04.035 --> 01:23:06.304
all she wanted was her
monthly checks from the county

01:23:06.336 --> 01:23:08.272
so she could feed
her drinking habit.

01:23:09.739 --> 01:23:12.143
Do you know what she's like
when she starts drinking?

01:23:13.476 --> 01:23:15.079
Well what'd you beat her with?

01:23:16.247 --> 01:23:18.415
What makes you
think I beat her?

01:23:18.448 --> 01:23:19.917
Beating someone is messy.

01:23:19.951 --> 01:23:22.452
I told you before, I
don't like to get messy.

01:23:24.588 --> 01:23:28.326
Just like a cobra,
fascinating to look at,

01:23:29.659 --> 01:23:31.394
but dangerous to be around.

01:23:32.596 --> 01:23:35.299
Funny, my brother
says the same thing.

01:23:37.767 --> 01:23:38.835
- I got this.
- Yeah.

01:23:41.438 --> 01:23:42.672
What's your name again?

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.309
It's Nicole.

01:23:46.576 --> 01:23:47.777
Such a pretty name.

01:23:49.046 --> 01:23:50.480
Listen beautiful, uh,

01:23:51.949 --> 01:23:53.383
maybe we can go out sometime.

01:23:54.417 --> 01:23:55.219
Would you like that?

01:23:55.253 --> 01:23:56.854
Wow.

01:23:56.888 --> 01:23:58.322
I sure would.

01:23:58.356 --> 01:24:02.126
Yeah, so would I,
but I have this problem, see.

01:24:02.159 --> 01:24:03.327
What problem is that?

01:24:04.896 --> 01:24:06.429
I'm gonna need to step our
for a few minutes, you know,

01:24:06.463 --> 01:24:09.833
to make arrangements
for our date.

01:24:11.269 --> 01:24:12.937
The problem is, if anybody
finds out that I left

01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:15.039
before the movie was over,

01:24:15.072 --> 01:24:17.074
I could be in some big trouble.

01:24:18.042 --> 01:24:19.709
In trouble with who?

01:24:19.743 --> 01:24:20.644
Nevermind that.

01:24:22.113 --> 01:24:23.680
Can I count on you or not?

01:24:23.713 --> 01:24:25.883
Just in case anybody asks.

01:24:27.018 --> 01:24:30.021
I won't tell
anyone, I promise.

01:24:30.054 --> 01:24:32.156
I'm gonna need more than that.

01:24:32.189 --> 01:24:35.860
Just if anybody asks
about me being here,

01:24:35.893 --> 01:24:38.062
I need you to tell them,

01:24:38.095 --> 01:24:39.196
I need you to tell them

01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:41.232
that I was here through
the whole movie.

01:24:42.499 --> 01:24:43.767
Sure, I can do that.

01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:47.437
Where would we go on the date?

01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:49.373
Oh, that's a surprise.

01:24:50.308 --> 01:24:51.641
I love surprises.

01:24:59.616 --> 01:25:02.386
I can see you're putting
together all the pieces now.

01:25:05.356 --> 01:25:07.191
Jack left the
theater mid-movie.

01:25:08.692 --> 01:25:11.828
He said he couldn't help
himself, he had to see.

01:25:12.964 --> 01:25:15.399
And she wasn't
dead so he beat her.

01:25:15.433 --> 01:25:19.170
She was getting there, but
the dosage was too small.

01:25:19.203 --> 01:25:21.906
I guess he walked in on her
trying to reach the phone.

01:25:23.374 --> 01:25:24.342
Well where is he?

01:25:25.675 --> 01:25:28.645
Not sure, maybe visiting
our aunt in Tulsa.

01:25:29.981 --> 01:25:31.315
You don't have an aunt.

01:25:34.517 --> 01:25:37.554
Okay Jack, it's
over, we got it all.

01:25:37.587 --> 01:25:39.256
You got anything to say?

01:25:41.025 --> 01:25:41.825
You don't have squat.

01:25:41.859 --> 01:25:43.294
I've got nothing to say.

01:25:43.327 --> 01:25:44.494
Well we know about Nicole,

01:25:44.527 --> 01:25:46.663
the young lady at
the concession stand.

01:25:48.933 --> 01:25:50.533
She broke under pressure.

01:25:51.668 --> 01:25:54.138
She told us, you asked
her to alibi you.

01:25:55.272 --> 01:25:56.773
So what'd you beat Edith with?

01:26:03.713 --> 01:26:04.547
A bat.

01:26:07.684 --> 01:26:08.551
How you feeling?

01:26:11.188 --> 01:26:13.357
I see we didn't give you
a strong enough dose.

01:26:13.391 --> 01:26:14.524
Just so you have a
complete understanding

01:26:14.557 --> 01:26:17.094
of what a wretched, selfish,

01:26:17.128 --> 01:26:19.629
uncaring, piece of meat you are,

01:26:22.433 --> 01:26:24.502
I'm gonna take a few
minutes of my time with you.

01:26:29.473 --> 01:26:31.641
Oh that
looks like it hurts.

01:26:32.809 --> 01:26:35.678
All those nights of
being mean to us,

01:26:35.712 --> 01:26:39.116
saying cruel things
to make Jenny cry?

01:26:46.190 --> 01:26:48.658
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

01:26:48.691 --> 01:26:50.760
Can't have the neighbors
hearing your screams.

01:26:53.164 --> 01:26:56.100
Actually, I'm, I'm not sorry.

01:26:59.970 --> 01:27:04.542
This world is going to be a
better place with you not in it.

01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:32.570
Oh and we know
about the herbs too.

01:27:33.504 --> 01:27:36.673
So like I said, we got you.

01:27:36.706 --> 01:27:38.142
Then you know that
I'm just a product

01:27:38.175 --> 01:27:40.444
of a really messed up society.

01:27:40.478 --> 01:27:43.948
Keep it the way it is and there
will be plenty more like me.

01:27:45.249 --> 01:27:46.984
You'll just be
stacking the bodies.

01:27:48.986 --> 01:27:50.820
Oh and I'm not 18 yet.

01:28:08.038 --> 01:28:10.040
Something wrong
with one of the cases?

01:28:20.783 --> 01:28:22.887
You know I used to think

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.456
that if I did enough
good in this world

01:28:26.423 --> 01:28:28.392
nothing bad would happen to me,

01:28:30.561 --> 01:28:32.795
that if I locked
up the bad guys,

01:28:32.829 --> 01:28:37.201
I could stave off all
the horrible tragedies

01:28:37.234 --> 01:28:38.636
we see every day.

01:28:40.538 --> 01:28:41.572
I can't stop it.

01:28:47.411 --> 01:28:52.016
Now I realize the most
important thing you can do

01:28:52.049 --> 01:28:55.619
is to spend time with
the ones you love

01:28:55.653 --> 01:28:59.756
being grateful for every
good moment you get.

01:29:00.858 --> 01:29:02.393
I see the same thing in you.

01:29:05.329 --> 01:29:08.199
You've never told me, but I
know something drives you.

01:29:10.167 --> 01:29:13.037
You're like me, you
live for the job,

01:29:15.406 --> 01:29:19.610
but don't let that be the
only thing that you live for.

01:29:23.948 --> 01:29:25.715
So, you're retiring?

01:29:26.617 --> 01:29:27.585
From this.

01:29:29.286 --> 01:29:32.156
I'm gonna spend time
with Devon, fishing.

01:29:39.663 --> 01:29:42.366
By the way, Jenks
took the plea deal.

01:29:53.978 --> 01:29:56.647
Wait, who's gonna replace you?

01:30:24.408 --> 01:30:25.775
For we

01:30:25.808 --> 01:30:28.112
are not fighting against
people made of flesh and blood,

01:30:28.145 --> 01:30:30.481
but against the evil
rulers and authorities

01:30:30.514 --> 01:30:34.784
of the unseen world, against
those mighty powers of darkness

01:30:34.817 --> 01:30:37.955
who rule this world and
against the wicked spirits

01:30:37.988 --> 01:30:39.490
in the Heavenly realms.
