WEBVTT

00:23.346 --> 00:25.250
What I want is
something you have...

00:25.250 --> 00:27.823
Something that is mine,
but which was given to you.

00:29.860 --> 00:32.331
Mr. Jaggers, may I welcome you
to the world of marine commerce

00:32.331 --> 00:33.400
with open arms.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.837
We will ensure
that only Drummle signs

00:34.837 --> 00:36.439
the insurance papers
for the ship.

00:36.439 --> 00:37.742
<i>He will be tried for complicity.</i>

00:38.243 --> 00:41.784
We will turn
your £5,000 into £50,000.

00:41.784 --> 00:43.120
We will use my money?

00:43.120 --> 00:45.056
We are not using your money.

00:45.625 --> 00:46.660
We are investing it.

00:46.660 --> 00:49.533
For surety, I will match it
from my own pocket.

00:49.533 --> 00:51.269
<i>I love you, Estella.</i>

00:51.269 --> 00:53.641
<i>Miss Havisham
has made it very clear</i>

00:53.641 --> 00:56.547
if I refuse to marry him,
she will disinherit me.

00:56.547 --> 00:58.383
You see, the thing is,
Pip is in love with me.

00:58.383 --> 00:59.653
But he must stop.

00:59.653 --> 01:00.655
He must.

01:00.655 --> 01:03.160
If he comes back here,
you should go to him.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.530
Why do you even care about him?

01:04.530 --> 01:05.564
Estella, no!

01:06.867 --> 01:07.835
Estella, no!

01:10.240 --> 01:11.442
I'm your father.

01:12.077 --> 01:14.282
When the sun comes up,
you tell your mama,

01:14.282 --> 01:16.353
I come with news about
the man who broke her heart.

01:16.353 --> 01:19.726
But I will only give it to her
if she changes her clothes.

01:22.699 --> 01:24.168
<i>I lit it for poor Pip.</i>

01:24.168 --> 01:26.707
In my dreams, I see trouble
for him all around.

01:27.175 --> 01:29.278
I don't want you
in the Exchange Hall

01:29.278 --> 01:31.516
because I don't want any of
my acquaintances to see.

01:32.418 --> 01:34.121
This is who I am now, Joe.

01:34.790 --> 01:35.959
Compeyson and Magwitch

01:35.959 --> 01:38.865
will still be fighting each
other 1,000 years from now.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.200
Why?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.837
<i>Molly was Magwitch's wife.</i>

01:41.837 --> 01:45.812
Molly was also the secret lover
of the irresistible Compeyson.

01:45.812 --> 01:48.417
It was Molly who divided
the two accomplices

01:48.417 --> 01:51.456
and condemned them
to an eternal battle.

01:51.456 --> 01:52.526
I will give you this.

01:52.526 --> 01:53.393
First, you should explain

01:53.393 --> 01:54.897
who it might be
I would be firing at.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.634
<i>I think
you already know who.</i>

01:56.634 --> 02:00.240
Usually, Mr. Jaggers
is as reliable as my old cannon.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.644
<i>Lately, since you arrived,</i>

02:01.644 --> 02:03.714
<i>sometimes Mr. Jaggers misfires.</i>

02:04.950 --> 02:06.285
Give me the gun.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.158
Leave the boy alone.

02:30.367 --> 02:31.737
Mm.

02:34.943 --> 02:36.781
Joe.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.951
Who the hell is out
on a night like this?

02:47.669 --> 02:48.837
I was on the river.

02:49.371 --> 02:51.710
I was forced ashore
by the storm.

02:55.350 --> 02:56.686
I need shelter.

02:59.926 --> 03:01.362
Come in.

03:13.821 --> 03:15.490
A shark got me.

03:17.629 --> 03:18.897
I was in Australia.

03:21.503 --> 03:22.972
Do you have a room
for the night?

03:29.051 --> 03:31.724
There's only two bedrooms
in this house.

03:31.724 --> 03:34.328
- Both occupied.
- One occupied, one waiting.

03:42.679 --> 03:44.248
Waiting for what?

03:45.450 --> 03:46.653
Our boy.

03:47.589 --> 03:49.759
- Our boy, Pip.
- Pip.

03:51.362 --> 03:52.497
Curious name.

04:01.048 --> 04:02.886
Any day he might return.

04:02.886 --> 04:06.493
Pip... Why wouldn't your Pip
want to return?

04:06.493 --> 04:09.298
Nice, out of the way place
like this.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.770
There's a tavern.
They have rooms.

04:11.770 --> 04:15.276
The Three Jolly Bargemen.
It's just across the way.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.388
Then I will go there.

04:24.061 --> 04:26.065
And I will sincerely hope
that your boy Pip

04:26.065 --> 04:28.035
returns home to you very soon.

04:31.543 --> 04:33.614
Good night to you, blacksmith.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.570
Excuse me.

05:14.763 --> 05:16.099
Oh, do you not knock?

05:16.099 --> 05:18.604
Do you not knock?
Pardon me, sir.

05:19.005 --> 05:20.742
I'll bring this from the Lloyd's
coffee house post room.

05:20.742 --> 05:22.845
A message
from Swanage Lighthouse.

05:29.759 --> 05:30.995
Oh, fuck.

05:55.010 --> 05:57.147
So let me guess
what the message says.

05:57.949 --> 06:00.521
Dorget's ship,
which we indemnified

06:00.521 --> 06:04.563
to the sum of £10,000

06:04.563 --> 06:07.836
was sunk in last night's storm.

06:07.836 --> 06:10.541
Yes. Indeed, it was.

06:15.751 --> 06:16.753
Excellent.

06:21.128 --> 06:22.832
How is it excellent?

06:22.832 --> 06:26.607
It is excellent
because somehow, Mr. Wemmick,

06:26.607 --> 06:29.846
I will turn
this terrible eventuality

06:29.846 --> 06:32.719
to my personal advantage.

06:32.719 --> 06:34.890
Yes, Mr. Jaggers.

06:34.890 --> 06:38.462
You see, there is no such thing
as misfortune.

06:39.097 --> 06:43.473
Only unfortunate fools who do
not have the imagination to...

06:44.710 --> 06:45.744
Fuck!

06:50.220 --> 06:52.659
Unfortunate fools
without the imagination

06:52.659 --> 06:55.163
to reconfigure the machinations
of fate.

06:55.865 --> 06:56.866
Hmm.

07:00.775 --> 07:02.011
Get a new mirror.

07:02.011 --> 07:05.117
Send someone out
for eels and sheep trotters.

07:05.117 --> 07:06.920
And give Pip the news.

07:10.193 --> 07:11.529
He will be on the river.

07:22.618 --> 07:23.620
Pip!

07:24.823 --> 07:26.660
Pip Gargery!

07:27.094 --> 07:28.764
Come ashore!

07:28.764 --> 07:30.934
I need to speak to you!

08:13.754 --> 08:16.826
What is it that is so urgent?

08:18.296 --> 08:19.665
Goodness.

08:22.037 --> 08:24.709
The world
has invited itself inside.

08:26.245 --> 08:27.749
We will need to fetch someone.

08:27.749 --> 08:29.953
A man. God help us!

08:29.953 --> 08:31.990
A man with a saw.

08:31.990 --> 08:33.994
Mama, this is not
what is so urgent.

08:35.764 --> 08:37.234
And there's a man already here.

08:37.234 --> 08:39.573
- Did you call someone?
- No.

08:39.573 --> 08:41.743
Storm that blew the tree down
blew him here.

08:42.979 --> 08:44.081
He's a man you know.

08:44.081 --> 08:47.121
The men I know do not cut timber
and they're not here.

08:47.121 --> 08:48.857
Well, a man you know is here.

08:51.295 --> 08:52.865
A man named Magwitch.

08:56.305 --> 08:57.675
Magwitch.

09:00.213 --> 09:02.585
In the storm,
he told me about myself,

09:03.887 --> 09:04.956
and a little about why I'm here.

09:04.956 --> 09:06.726
- Is he alone?
- He is alone.

09:08.296 --> 09:10.133
But he says he has news
about another.

09:11.937 --> 09:13.807
We should pick up
the broken glass.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.046
News about a man
named Compeyson.

09:19.084 --> 09:20.855
Between the storm ending
and the sun rising,

09:20.855 --> 09:23.694
- I've decided many things...
- We really should call someone

09:23.694 --> 09:25.665
to cut the tree
and to pick up the broken glass.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.735
The world should not
invite itself in.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.606
I've decided

09:29.606 --> 09:31.843
that I will not marry
Herbert Pocket,

09:32.411 --> 09:34.715
and I will not marry
Mr. Drummle.

09:35.684 --> 09:36.786
And you

09:38.422 --> 09:40.126
will not try to make me.

09:43.266 --> 09:45.637
And we will not continue
as we have always done.

09:47.708 --> 09:49.111
Magwitch, my father,

09:49.111 --> 09:51.649
says today is the day
when everything changes.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.000
And you will change.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.672
He will not speak
to a broken-hearted bride.

10:34.575 --> 10:35.756
What’s so urgent Mr. Wemmick?

10:43.252 --> 10:47.895
Last night, the mighty storm
blew us great misfortune, Pip.

10:49.832 --> 10:52.972
The ship we indemnified,
it was lost.

10:53.908 --> 10:57.113
Captain Dorget's ship was blown
onto the rocks at Swanage.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.988
All hands lost, all cargo lost.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.770
Then that is very sad
for the crew.

11:09.304 --> 11:10.941
Very sad, yes.

11:11.543 --> 11:13.078
And for their loved ones.

11:15.784 --> 11:18.824
And very sad for Drummle and Co.

11:18.824 --> 11:19.826
No, not very sad.

11:19.826 --> 11:22.865
For, for Drummle and Co,
it is only quite sad.

11:24.067 --> 11:26.806
For you and Mr. Jaggers,
it is very sad.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.988
If you recall,
as part of the plan

11:33.988 --> 11:35.423
to put yourself in the majority

11:35.423 --> 11:37.795
in the event
of Drummle's arrest,

11:37.795 --> 11:39.398
80 % of the indemnity

11:39.398 --> 11:41.836
was offered by Mr. Jaggers
and by yourself.

11:42.370 --> 11:45.009
But the ship went down
without illegal cargo.

11:45.678 --> 11:47.881
So the insurance is valid, Pip.

11:51.088 --> 11:53.994
Mr. Wemmick, I have been rather
vague for the last few weeks.

11:55.229 --> 11:56.298
Remind me.

11:57.968 --> 12:00.507
How much of my fortune
did I invest in this enterprise?

12:11.529 --> 12:12.931
All of it, Pip.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.369
Eh... Every penny.

12:20.079 --> 12:21.181
Of course.

12:27.127 --> 12:28.931
Estella said
it always ends the same way

12:28.931 --> 12:30.199
for gentlemen like myself.

12:32.237 --> 12:34.407
Hanging from one of the bridges
of London,

12:35.076 --> 12:37.114
with stones in your pocket
instead of coins.

12:37.114 --> 12:39.150
No, no, no. No.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.423
Do not let me hear you
say such things.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.369
You came to London
and you thought...

12:48.369 --> 12:50.508
You thought it was a tame dog

12:50.508 --> 12:52.310
but it's a... It's a fox.

12:52.310 --> 12:54.214
- London is a fox, you see.
- Mr. Wemmick,

12:54.214 --> 12:57.020
do you think you could leave me
alone for a little while?

13:05.904 --> 13:08.442
Down the river,
not 40 miles east,

13:09.377 --> 13:10.480
there is a loving family

13:10.480 --> 13:12.518
with a perfectly
respectable business.

13:14.054 --> 13:16.158
In the end, Pip, you would be
happier at the forge

13:16.158 --> 13:17.628
than what you would be
at the counting house.

13:44.481 --> 13:46.418
Miss Havisham
will be down momentarily.

13:47.555 --> 13:48.990
Do you call her Miss Havisham

13:49.625 --> 13:50.627
or Mama?

13:54.468 --> 13:56.238
You were born a workman,

13:57.040 --> 13:59.278
so you think physical work
is what fathers do?

13:59.278 --> 14:00.547
I wish I was a workman.

14:01.950 --> 14:02.951
No.

14:05.289 --> 14:08.028
I wish it was anything
other than who I was.

14:12.303 --> 14:13.640
Now I see her in your eyes.

14:14.441 --> 14:16.879
You see who in my eyes?

14:30.106 --> 14:31.909
I thought
I would bring fuel.

14:38.990 --> 14:40.192
You are much changed.

14:41.629 --> 14:42.931
As are you.

14:48.543 --> 14:52.951
Estella tells me that 21 years,
three months and four days

14:53.485 --> 14:56.224
after he failed
to appear at the altar

14:58.095 --> 14:59.230
you have information

14:59.932 --> 15:02.336
about the devil
portrayed in this picture.

15:04.542 --> 15:07.046
I haven't uttered his name
in 21 years.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.962
Compeyson...

15:15.664 --> 15:16.933
There...

15:18.402 --> 15:20.941
What news do you have
of this man, Mr. Magwitch?

15:23.780 --> 15:25.316
All those years ago,

15:27.020 --> 15:29.658
we were put aboard the same ship
to Australia.

15:31.729 --> 15:33.131
He cheated me too.

15:35.036 --> 15:37.373
I pursued him across
the entire cursed continent.

15:43.052 --> 15:44.689
I managed
to do this much to him.

15:44.689 --> 15:46.125
But he's alive.

15:46.125 --> 15:48.262
Yeah, he's alive
and back in England.

15:49.565 --> 15:52.638
He is the other reason
I came from Australia.

15:53.206 --> 15:54.508
I came for love of you

15:56.211 --> 15:57.413
and hatred of him.

16:14.481 --> 16:16.284
I came back to find him
and kill him.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.556
But I will need your help.

17:20.747 --> 17:22.216
Pip.

17:22.885 --> 17:24.220
Pip!

17:41.522 --> 17:43.259
What the devil?!?

17:44.896 --> 17:46.131
Excuse me.

17:55.851 --> 17:58.723
Is this you reporting for work?

17:59.457 --> 18:00.593
I found Pip...

18:02.765 --> 18:04.400
And then I lost him.

18:05.670 --> 18:07.474
I looked along the banks
all the way to Deptford.

18:07.474 --> 18:09.277
Uh, but there
are only, uh, gulls,

18:09.277 --> 18:12.116
and, and children
and oysters and...

18:15.657 --> 18:17.527
What I mean
to say is...

18:19.832 --> 18:21.903
I'm afraid I'm almost certain
that the news of Pip

18:21.903 --> 18:23.673
is anything but excellent.

18:25.376 --> 18:27.446
The Thames
has claimed another life.

18:29.585 --> 18:31.455
Thank you, Wemmick.

18:31.455 --> 18:33.458
I will personally inform
the family.

18:39.337 --> 18:40.472
This could all
have been his.

18:41.943 --> 18:44.247
Everything could have been his.

18:48.857 --> 18:50.928
Why did he not come
to the altar?

18:56.405 --> 18:58.408
It was for no reason
involving you.

18:59.244 --> 19:01.516
- Why?
- Because of his curly hair,

19:01.516 --> 19:04.822
his black clothes,
his white pocket handkerchief.

19:05.256 --> 19:08.830
In short, Miss Havisham, because
Compeyson was born a gentleman.

19:08.830 --> 19:10.734
And gentlemen do
whatever suits them.

19:11.936 --> 19:14.474
They steal and lie and then brag

19:14.474 --> 19:16.211
and have statues
built of themselves.

19:16.211 --> 19:17.681
They've built an empire on it.

19:20.453 --> 19:22.456
He didn't appear that day because...

19:24.027 --> 19:26.264
Because something more suitable
came up.

19:29.003 --> 19:31.374
I know Compeyson
as well as I know myself.

19:33.847 --> 19:35.583
So you know
he will come for this?

19:36.184 --> 19:37.687
Oh, he will come for the gold.

19:39.758 --> 19:40.960
And he will come for you.

19:43.533 --> 19:44.668
How strong are you?

19:46.639 --> 19:47.974
I am stronger
than you.

19:48.509 --> 19:50.412
I'm stronger than this house.

19:50.881 --> 19:52.450
I am stronger than fire.

20:11.021 --> 20:12.356
Pip!

20:22.911 --> 20:25.650
Boy, wake up.

20:27.721 --> 20:28.723
Tea,

20:29.825 --> 20:30.860
and rum.

20:31.428 --> 20:33.365
Get the river out of your bones.

20:34.769 --> 20:35.770
No.

20:36.639 --> 20:37.774
Tea then.

21:02.390 --> 21:03.526
Isle of Dogs.

21:07.935 --> 21:09.938
- You heading east?
- Yes.

21:11.074 --> 21:13.011
To the convict dock
at Gravesend.

21:19.490 --> 21:21.394
Convict dock at Gravesend.

21:23.900 --> 21:24.902
Of course.

21:27.641 --> 21:28.843
It is kind of God

21:29.745 --> 21:33.418
to lay on a boat to take me
to my inevitable destination.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.787
While I'm here, Miss Havisham
wants to make use of me.

22:08.756 --> 22:10.425
Getting rid of everything old.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.068
You said you saw someone
in my eyes.

22:27.694 --> 22:28.796
I saw your mother

22:29.765 --> 22:30.867
in your eyes.

22:32.804 --> 22:34.140
I don't need to lie about her.

22:36.545 --> 22:39.551
She's from Kentucky, America.

22:41.622 --> 22:43.491
She escaped from her chain.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.502
She's alive?

22:51.942 --> 22:53.178
When I was put on trial,

22:53.178 --> 22:55.148
she was taken into service
by my lawyer,

22:56.051 --> 22:57.119
Mr. Jaggers.

23:00.794 --> 23:01.795
When I go to London,

23:03.131 --> 23:04.433
I'll see her.

23:06.806 --> 23:07.874
You'll see her too.

23:12.249 --> 23:13.719
That is to say...

23:15.189 --> 23:17.527
It's my wish,
when my business here is done...

23:20.600 --> 23:23.640
I hope you might come with me
to London.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.008
Like father and daughter?

23:27.914 --> 23:28.916
Yes.

23:29.885 --> 23:30.887
No.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.697
I'm afraid
everything changed today.

23:36.632 --> 23:37.801
Except my heart.

25:16.197 --> 25:17.199
Joe?

26:35.990 --> 26:37.159
Mr. Jaggers.

26:45.075 --> 26:46.344
I was passing.

26:48.381 --> 26:50.051
I have business
with Miss Havisham.

26:51.287 --> 26:52.289
Up town.

26:56.197 --> 26:57.867
Can I take a drink of beer?

26:59.303 --> 27:00.973
It was a difficult night.

27:10.994 --> 27:12.230
I've never seen you drink beer.

27:12.230 --> 27:13.666
I never do.

27:16.037 --> 27:19.210
So, here you are.

27:21.047 --> 27:23.251
You've decided
to carry on living.

27:29.463 --> 27:31.334
What makes you think
I considered not living?

27:32.003 --> 27:33.839
It was Wemmick who cut the rope.

27:40.352 --> 27:42.189
Where will you live?

27:45.062 --> 27:46.063
Here.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.034
I will live here.

27:49.036 --> 27:51.140
Joe's knees are gone, so...

27:53.011 --> 27:54.346
I will become Joe.

28:04.467 --> 28:06.003
Are you all right, Mr. Jaggers?

28:07.106 --> 28:08.408
You don't seem to be yourself.

28:10.212 --> 28:11.380
I don't think I am.

28:13.986 --> 28:15.322
Not right now, anyway.

28:18.161 --> 28:21.100
I'm wondering which parts of me
are still there from before

28:22.136 --> 28:23.371
and which are not.

28:28.816 --> 28:30.485
Beer, by the way,
is utterly disgusting.

28:31.889 --> 28:33.158
That's more like it,
Mr. Jaggers.

28:33.158 --> 28:34.193
Yes.

28:35.897 --> 28:36.898
But you...

28:45.415 --> 28:47.085
You should stay with beer.

28:51.294 --> 28:53.231
I resolved beer, not rum.

28:55.068 --> 28:56.806
And from pipes, only tobacco.

28:56.806 --> 28:58.776
Beer is a good thing morally.

28:59.344 --> 29:01.916
Personally I wouldn't wash
my fucking feet in it.

29:05.022 --> 29:07.860
But I hope you will never go
to Limehouse ever again.

29:09.397 --> 29:10.432
Never.

29:10.432 --> 29:12.102
Well, you know where I am.

29:15.375 --> 29:16.812
Back in the Bailey

29:17.446 --> 29:19.383
and you're back at the bellows.

29:20.853 --> 29:22.289
As if it all never happened.

29:23.191 --> 29:24.527
Not quite.

29:35.282 --> 29:36.317
I now understand

29:36.317 --> 29:38.856
why the only people from London
who ever come here

29:38.856 --> 29:40.125
are already dead.

29:51.982 --> 29:52.984
Give me rum

29:53.886 --> 29:54.988
and cloves.

29:57.326 --> 29:59.263
I need to wash away
a foul taste.

30:07.045 --> 30:08.114
Give me the bottle.

30:13.559 --> 30:15.863
Last time you were here,
you left with Pip Gargery.

30:17.567 --> 30:19.036
How is he?

30:19.036 --> 30:21.006
He has decided to return home.

30:23.478 --> 30:25.014
To this rat hole.

30:27.620 --> 30:29.256
Poor fucker.

30:37.808 --> 30:40.045
You still owe me
four shillings for last night.

30:40.045 --> 30:41.882
Thank you
for your hospitality.

30:43.552 --> 30:44.588
If you're leaving
for London,

30:44.588 --> 30:46.424
the storm's closed
all the roads.

30:46.424 --> 30:47.527
I shall be paying
for the pleasure

30:47.527 --> 30:49.330
of your company
for one more night.

31:04.661 --> 31:05.663
But of course.

31:07.065 --> 31:08.569
Who else could you belong to?

31:15.215 --> 31:16.317
Pip.

31:27.974 --> 31:29.711
I shod your horse, Biddy.

31:29.711 --> 31:30.946
You shod it?

31:35.155 --> 31:37.225
How did I get everything
so completely wrong?

31:39.564 --> 31:41.233
I'm going to become
who I was meant to be.

31:42.670 --> 31:44.339
Beers, not rum.

31:44.774 --> 31:46.579
Tobacco, not opium.

31:46.579 --> 31:48.281
Biddy, not Estella.

31:49.350 --> 31:51.387
The lesser of two options.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.491
No, I'm sorry, Biddy.

31:56.030 --> 31:57.232
That's not what I mean.

32:00.706 --> 32:02.510
I mean, I chose to come back.

32:04.781 --> 32:06.050
To see you.

32:12.730 --> 32:13.999
Sorry.

32:15.468 --> 32:17.607
I just, just came
to return your horse.

32:21.715 --> 32:22.717
Have you changed, Pip?

32:24.453 --> 32:26.658
Or are you still
the center of the universe?

32:32.737 --> 32:34.106
How could I not have changed?

32:34.741 --> 32:35.743
I've changed.

32:37.212 --> 32:39.150
I am a Chartist now, Pip.

32:39.150 --> 32:41.020
I've joined
the Chartist movement.

32:41.822 --> 32:43.759
Women are very welcome.

32:46.063 --> 32:49.538
We're trying to change the world
so I'd be a little busy

32:49.538 --> 32:52.409
to be put in your kitchen
with your beer and your tobacco.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.018
I don't even have a kitchen.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.289
It's my sister's home.

33:01.561 --> 33:03.699
But you're very welcome in it, Biddy.

33:28.481 --> 33:29.449
Pip?

33:41.742 --> 33:42.743
Let me guess.

33:44.279 --> 33:45.516
You're running
to the schoolhouse

33:45.516 --> 33:48.154
to tell Biddy's father his horse
has been stolen from the shop.

33:49.824 --> 33:52.228
I was in church. Praying.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.301
I got back
and the horse was gone.

33:59.811 --> 34:01.581
The horse hasn't been stolen.

34:04.420 --> 34:06.591
I nailed a full set of shoes on
and delivered it.

34:18.782 --> 34:22.523
Come. Sara will burst
into flames.

34:24.159 --> 34:26.130
Good flames or bad flames?

34:27.332 --> 34:28.536
Impossible to predict, Pip.

34:33.177 --> 34:35.482
There will be regulations
and divisions.

34:35.482 --> 34:37.821
You will start
as a regular apprentice.

34:37.821 --> 34:40.492
It'll be one for you
and four for Joe.

34:40.492 --> 34:41.628
Then, after a year,

34:42.296 --> 34:44.399
it'll be three for you
and two for Joe.

34:44.934 --> 34:47.673
And after two years,
three for you, three for Joe.

34:48.074 --> 34:49.511
That's six.

34:49.511 --> 34:51.815
Three and three is six.
Yes, I know.

34:51.815 --> 34:52.950
No.

34:52.950 --> 34:55.556
I mean, you started off
dividing five of whatever it is

34:55.556 --> 34:56.825
between Joe and I.

34:56.825 --> 34:59.229
And then you said we would each
have three of whatever it is.

35:00.633 --> 35:02.168
That's six.

35:02.703 --> 35:04.574
Pip's first day, uh,

35:04.574 --> 35:06.143
why don't we stow talk of money

35:06.678 --> 35:07.880
and talk
about something else, eh?

35:10.318 --> 35:11.554
Last night's storm, Pip,

35:12.355 --> 35:13.525
how was it in London?

35:14.728 --> 35:15.730
I don't care to talk about

35:15.730 --> 35:17.567
the consequences
of the storm, Joe.

35:17.567 --> 35:19.938
Hmm. Brought new words.

35:19.938 --> 35:23.478
Well, the storm last night
brought us a big fright.

35:23.478 --> 35:25.883
- Didn't it, Sara?
- It did.

35:25.883 --> 35:28.622
A man standing there
in that doorway

35:28.622 --> 35:30.893
in a big hat,
running with water,

35:30.893 --> 35:33.465
and with a scar
running all down his face

35:33.465 --> 35:35.602
and he comes in
saying his boat had tipped up.

35:36.270 --> 35:38.743
- What did he want?
- Lodging.

35:38.743 --> 35:41.615
I told him, the only room we had
was your room,

35:41.615 --> 35:45.489
and I said, I couldn't rent it
because you might return home.

35:45.489 --> 35:47.727
He got quite interested
when we said you might return.

35:48.228 --> 35:49.429
Kept using your name.

35:49.864 --> 35:51.601
Pip this, Pip that.

35:53.539 --> 35:55.242
And where did he go?

35:55.242 --> 35:57.312
I sent him
to the The Jolly Bargemen.

35:57.312 --> 36:00.586
And with the road's closed,
he will be there yet I imagine.

36:04.561 --> 36:06.430
Pip, where are you going?

36:33.351 --> 36:34.620
Mr. Jaggers?

36:37.827 --> 36:39.764
Mr. Jaggers, he's here.

36:42.537 --> 36:43.672
Who goes there?

36:44.473 --> 36:45.475
Pip.

36:45.910 --> 36:46.945
Pip Gargery.

36:50.485 --> 36:51.922
Pip Gargery.

36:51.922 --> 36:53.424
I know that voice.

37:01.608 --> 37:02.710
I thought you were dead.

37:04.079 --> 37:05.381
Not yet.

37:07.385 --> 37:08.387
Come.

37:09.156 --> 37:11.426
- We must get out of sight.
- You've got a key?

37:12.530 --> 37:14.500
Many things have changed, Pip.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.669
Go.

37:17.773 --> 37:19.043
We will find him
in the village

37:19.043 --> 37:20.813
and send him to hell.

37:21.247 --> 37:22.883
We have resolved,
Magwitch and I.

37:24.052 --> 37:26.691
We'll go to him before he gets
the chance to come to us.

37:27.392 --> 37:28.929
Then I will finish him myself.

37:28.929 --> 37:31.000
I told you,
Mr. Jaggers.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.505
It'll be I
who does tonight's work.

37:36.878 --> 37:38.782
- Here.
- Uh, Mr. Magwitch,

37:39.316 --> 37:40.720
the boy has turned his back

37:40.720 --> 37:42.489
on the sporting life
of a gentleman,

37:43.091 --> 37:45.662
and settled at the station
God meant for him.

37:49.504 --> 37:51.440
What he means,
Mr. Magwitch,

37:53.745 --> 37:55.448
is that the fortune
you left for me,

37:55.983 --> 37:57.285
I wasted.

38:02.362 --> 38:04.466
Mr. Jaggers
has told me your story.

38:06.470 --> 38:08.742
He was very gentle
with your reputation.

38:10.613 --> 38:12.950
You spent my fortune on a ticket

38:14.119 --> 38:16.323
for a grand journey

38:16.792 --> 38:18.895
which led back to the place
from where you came.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.670
I've been
on a similar journey, Pip.

38:23.171 --> 38:25.776
We're both back
where we're destined to be.

38:29.918 --> 38:31.353
Mr. Magwitch,

38:32.857 --> 38:34.561
many nights at 4:00 a.m.
I have rehearsed

38:34.561 --> 38:35.929
all of the questions
I have for you.

38:36.397 --> 38:37.766
There's no time
for answers, Pip.

38:40.539 --> 38:43.144
I once brought you bread
and a metal file,

38:43.144 --> 38:44.714
and in return
you changed my life.

38:46.685 --> 38:48.387
For better or worse?

38:51.026 --> 38:52.395
Powder and shot...

38:54.466 --> 38:55.468
Um...

38:57.472 --> 39:00.077
Enough to ensure
that justice is done.

39:01.013 --> 39:04.452
Mr. Jaggers, we must fly.

39:07.927 --> 39:10.599
I'll stay here at Satis
and guard the ladies.

39:11.300 --> 39:13.471
It's the ladies
who will guard you, Pip.

39:17.178 --> 39:18.882
Estella, when I came back here
to the village,

39:18.882 --> 39:20.485
it was with the firm intention

39:20.485 --> 39:22.456
of never coming to your door
ever again.

39:22.456 --> 39:24.059
And here I am on my first night.

39:24.059 --> 39:26.396
But it is not love
that brings me.

39:38.855 --> 39:39.957
Do you feel love?

39:45.101 --> 39:46.103
Yes.

39:49.544 --> 39:50.679
Stubborn love...

39:53.217 --> 39:54.520
Like a mule.

39:55.021 --> 39:56.456
Because to be clear,

39:57.860 --> 39:59.664
I do not love you.

40:05.943 --> 40:07.580
Why are you telling me?

40:07.580 --> 40:11.120
Mama and I have discussed
this matter like scientists.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.124
We agree that her life is proof

40:13.124 --> 40:14.927
that love is as poisonous
as mercury.

40:16.731 --> 40:18.902
We've burnt so much
of significance today.

40:19.637 --> 40:21.841
To burn a simple log
is quite funny.

40:25.616 --> 40:27.820
I do love you, Estella.

40:28.922 --> 40:30.892
- Good.
- How is it good?

40:32.095 --> 40:33.832
In a relationship,

40:33.832 --> 40:35.736
whoever loves the most, loses.

40:36.705 --> 40:38.107
Whoever loves least, wins.

40:41.781 --> 40:43.818
- Wins what?
- In a marriage,

40:45.254 --> 40:47.492
to be the one
who doesn't love at all

40:48.628 --> 40:50.599
is to be
in the best possible position.

40:51.735 --> 40:54.674
If you are to be married,
it is best to be indifferent.

40:57.145 --> 40:58.982
What marriage
are you talking about?

41:01.788 --> 41:03.558
It's all been decided, Pip.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.267
Mama agrees

41:08.802 --> 41:11.239
I should marry someone
who loves me,

41:12.041 --> 41:13.210
whom I do not love.

41:24.801 --> 41:28.641
You get him to come outside,
I'll blow him to hell.

42:00.004 --> 42:01.040
Mount up!

42:01.040 --> 42:02.342
He's gone!

42:32.903 --> 42:33.938
Oh, God.

42:35.274 --> 42:36.644
What do you want?

42:37.345 --> 42:38.915
I came to say sorry.

42:42.222 --> 42:43.925
To say sorry to you in person.

42:45.094 --> 42:47.098
- I behaved appallingly.
-"Sorry."

42:47.098 --> 42:48.668
I was a different man...

42:49.504 --> 42:51.641
- If I had my time again...
- Time has gone.

42:51.641 --> 42:53.912
- I've been punished.
- Not enough.

42:53.912 --> 42:55.148
Never a day has gone by...

42:55.148 --> 42:57.051
- You're ugly now.
- I'm glad.

43:01.326 --> 43:02.596
This scar...

43:03.330 --> 43:05.301
Keeps me
out of trouble.

43:08.073 --> 43:10.010
I stay in my room and repent.

43:12.115 --> 43:16.791
Tonight I lay in my damp room
and wondered...

43:19.195 --> 43:20.264
Wondered what?

43:20.899 --> 43:23.237
How you would be
when you saw me again.

43:28.113 --> 43:29.215
What do you want?

43:30.084 --> 43:31.954
I am honest these days.

43:35.027 --> 43:36.296
I need money, Amelia.

43:38.033 --> 43:40.672
- No one calls me that.
- Amelia.

43:41.975 --> 43:43.177
I need money.

43:45.348 --> 43:47.385
I wouldn't lie to you.
I don't lie.

43:58.307 --> 43:59.409
I need gold.

44:00.879 --> 44:04.453
I recall, uh, you have gold
from China here.

44:04.453 --> 44:07.993
Payment for opium
from years ago.

44:10.131 --> 44:12.301
Gold doesn't age as we do.

44:14.472 --> 44:16.042
I wondered...

44:19.517 --> 44:22.890
Do I even need this pistol
just to take a handful of coins

44:22.890 --> 44:25.294
just to get to London
and set me up in lodgings?

44:30.371 --> 44:31.874
Where perhaps...

44:35.816 --> 44:37.719
...you could come
and visit me someday.

44:49.810 --> 44:51.212
I came at last, Amelia.

44:53.852 --> 44:56.189
This thing you always wanted
has finally happened.

44:56.824 --> 44:57.826
Yes.

44:58.460 --> 45:00.164
Yes, you came
just as I'd recovered.

45:00.164 --> 45:03.137
Yes. Yes.

45:03.137 --> 45:05.441
I haven't felt anything
with my body since.

45:11.053 --> 45:12.421
My gun is loaded.

45:13.892 --> 45:15.194
But the question is,

45:16.998 --> 45:18.901
will I need it
to make you help me?

45:21.073 --> 45:22.074
No.

45:24.547 --> 45:26.116
No, you will not need it.

45:39.476 --> 45:40.879
Miss Havisham's ring.

45:42.415 --> 45:43.483
It's mine now.

46:12.509 --> 46:13.978
Oh, my dear.

46:15.414 --> 46:16.818
Isn't even loaded.

46:23.263 --> 46:25.234
But I can assure you
this one is.

46:27.906 --> 46:30.812
I had hoped
I wouldn't need this.

46:32.081 --> 46:33.350
It seems that I do.

46:35.154 --> 46:36.322
Unlock the safe

46:37.425 --> 46:39.162
and give me what I came for.

46:43.170 --> 46:44.807
Give me the fucking key!

46:47.478 --> 46:49.349
Loaded gun or happiness?

46:50.952 --> 46:53.290
Loaded gun, I think.

46:58.601 --> 47:02.308
Locked in a box
I spent year after year.

47:02.308 --> 47:03.878
It's against nature.

47:06.984 --> 47:09.489
Just as a woman
rotting in a house untouched

47:09.489 --> 47:11.193
is worthless.

47:11.193 --> 47:13.230
It is against nature.

47:22.983 --> 47:24.219
I burnt your portrait.

47:24.219 --> 47:25.522
Now I'm going to burn you.

47:27.191 --> 47:28.227
Now,
look what madness

47:28.227 --> 47:30.164
I abandoned at the altar.

47:30.599 --> 47:31.600
Which will win?

47:32.234 --> 47:34.238
Greed or self-preservation?

47:52.308 --> 47:54.212
He's here, not in the village.

47:55.247 --> 47:56.650
He has a gun.

47:57.351 --> 48:00.959
- He has just the one, yes?
- Just one that's loaded.

48:00.959 --> 48:02.094
Stay here.

48:28.548 --> 48:30.985
He's mine!

48:34.493 --> 48:35.528
Go!

48:55.301 --> 48:58.006
It's me, Magwitch.

48:59.309 --> 49:01.045
You should stay here.

50:10.117 --> 50:11.152
Magwitch?

50:31.594 --> 50:32.829
You, boy.

50:35.134 --> 50:37.806
This, for me to pass.

50:39.743 --> 50:41.179
Go to hell!

50:43.785 --> 50:46.658
Very well, very well.

51:08.868 --> 51:11.139
I think your education
is complete, Pip.

51:38.795 --> 51:39.863
<i>Satis.</i>

51:41.199 --> 51:42.267
Enough.

51:49.550 --> 51:50.551
Pip?

51:56.262 --> 51:57.331
You, uh...

51:58.066 --> 52:00.170
You didn't complete
your proposal.

52:07.586 --> 52:09.388
You said you are immune to love.

52:14.365 --> 52:16.837
What you need
is someone who is your equal.

52:19.843 --> 52:22.816
A fellow exile
from the human race.

54:15.073 --> 54:17.679
<i>Magis magisque satis est.</i>

54:18.915 --> 54:20.618
And do you know what that means?

54:21.219 --> 54:23.924
- It means more than enough.
- Hmm.
