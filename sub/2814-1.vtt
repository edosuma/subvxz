03:05.600 --> 03:07.679
Our boys' curriculum is very wide.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.119
They perform a short play
at the end of every term.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.439
Theater's an abiding
interest of my wife.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.599
- Ah, Mary, tea if you please.
- Yes, sir.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.186
Through the open door.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.679
Nelly, where were you?

03:18.680 --> 03:20.639
Mr. Benham has been
here since 3:00.

03:20.640 --> 03:21.759
I'm so sorry.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.759
Mr. Lambourne has been
organizing the boys best he can.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.585
I lost all sense of time.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.119
Careful with those corners, boys.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.024
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.799
Thank you, Mary.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.159
Ah, Mrs. Wharton Robinson.
At last.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.950
I'm so sorry, Mr. Benham.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.747
I just kept walking. Forgive me.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.039
Dear boys, let's go
from the third act.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.599
Everyone get into positions.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.709
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, Mr. Lambourne.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.719
Mr. Benham must not see
all our tricks quite yet

03:52.720 --> 03:54.639
or there'll be nothing left
to show him tomorrow.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.879
It is cold outside?

03:55.880 --> 03:58.228
It is, but it clears the mind.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.999
It would be good to decide on the
readings before the end of term.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.428
Of course. Perhaps later.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.505
- Laurenson and Tanner, are you ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.021
Geoffrey dear,

04:08.840 --> 04:10.799
don't forget, you come
in on the final line.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.261
Sit there.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.839
Coates, Watson, take those.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.665
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you, ma'am.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.959
I recall no lion in Mr. Dickens

04:19.959 --> 04:22.479
and Mr. Collins' play,
Mrs. Wharton Robinson.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.719
A little dramatic license.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.988
I'm confident that Mr. Dickens
would have let it pass.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.039
Yates, if you could
drop the backing.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.341
Yes, ma'am.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.541
Musicians.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.679
- Is everyone ready?
- I think so.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.709
Yes, ma'am.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.910
Boys, remember your positions.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.319
Let's begin.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.759
Well, my lads, the day
is breaking at last.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.586
"Has broken," Hadley. Mr. Dickens
was very particular.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.106
Well, my lads, the day
has broken at last.

05:08.520 --> 05:09.999
What do you say
to the weather now?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.559
I am ready to cross the
mountain with the gentleman,

05:12.560 --> 05:14.719
if the others will go with me.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.500
I can see for myself
there's a storm coming.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.439
I smell the snow. I feel
the hurricane in the air.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.759
No money those gentlemen can offer

05:23.760 --> 05:26.028
will tempt me to cross the
mountain with them today.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.068
Tanner, your cue.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.039
Well, are you ready at last?

05:33.040 --> 05:34.399
My patience is at an end.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.199
I'm sick and weary
of all this doubt and delay.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.106
I'm your man. I will guide
you to your journey's end.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.759
- Say when.
- Now.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.759
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.061
Come along.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.071
Pull it taut.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.189
Upright like a brigadier.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.119
And thread it through.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.626
Thank you.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.945
Were you on the beach again today?

06:20.440 --> 06:22.026
Miss Brooke thought she saw you.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.221
Yes.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.229
- Look. See? It is signed.
- Really?

06:38.560 --> 06:41.319
Apparently he modeled the character
of Lucie Manette on Nelly.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.679
The families were very
close when Nelly was a child.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.879
I'm sure he drew
inspiration from many people.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.079
My wife adores his novels.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.119
Of course, he's often very funny,
but I find a little bleak.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.719
One wonders what demons
raged in his mind.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.799
Indeed.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.159
Thackeray, there's a writer.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.519
George, you cannot compare them.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.279
Oh, I agree. I am for Mr. Dickens.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.679
There are times that I have
envied Mrs. Wharton Robinson

07:01.680 --> 07:04.559
to have known him even as a child.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.679
A writer.

07:05.680 --> 07:10.279
Yes, at times bleak, but one who
makes us laugh at our own absurdity.

07:10.280 --> 07:13.319
We see ourselves
clearly in all our folly.

07:14.840 --> 07:18.879
He's been dead for some years,
but yes, he is still with us.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.319
Thank you, Mr. Benham.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.359
Oh, it is a subject in which I
sometimes run away with myself,

07:23.360 --> 07:26.559
as Mrs. Wharton Robinson
knows only too well.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.759
Run away. Run away.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.879
I, for one, am determined
to revisit him immediately.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.199
Where would you suggest I begin?

07:33.200 --> 07:34.359
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit.</i>

07:34.360 --> 07:36.239
Any novel, but for brief pleasure,

07:36.240 --> 07:38.239
I would suggest browsing
through a copy of

07:38.240 --> 07:40.199
Dickens' weekly literary magazine.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.626
Oh.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.879
<i>Household Words.</i>

07:45.880 --> 07:48.399
A collection of many
of his writings,

07:48.400 --> 07:50.702
and indeed,
chapters of his novels.

07:50.840 --> 07:52.199
And I'm sure Mrs. Wharton Robinson

07:52.200 --> 07:54.039
would not mind if
you cared to borrow.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.119
Of course.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.799
My wife has nearly every edition.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.359
We have run out of shelves.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.799
Sir.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.829
Ah, good. Thank you, Mary.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.350
<i>The Frozen Deep.</i>

08:06.720 --> 08:08.399
You have the text
of Mr. Collins' play?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.225
Yes. it is not a good play.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.983
But I shall find you one.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.279
<i>- David Copperfield.
- David Copperfield?</i>

08:17.280 --> 08:19.628
- For our readings.
- Oh, yes.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.879
Will you walk again tomorrow?

08:23.880 --> 08:25.386
Perhaps.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.559
May I join you?

08:30.560 --> 08:32.100
I walk at quite a pace.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.399
- Welcome. Welcome, Mrs. Ternan.
- Thank you, Charley.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.679
Oh, dear.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.982
Um, yes, do be careful now.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.799
Oh, my!

09:49.800 --> 09:52.759
- Oh, Miss Maria. Come inside.
- Thank you.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.359
- Come inside.
- Thank you. Ooh!

09:54.360 --> 09:55.741
Miss Ellen, welcome.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.359
- Oh, your glove.
- Thank you.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.479
I'm Charley Dickens.
Welcome to Manchester.

10:01.480 --> 10:02.959
It's so wet.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.239
My father is waiting.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.304
The others are already here.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.039
Nelly, look. See?

10:09.040 --> 10:10.239
There we are.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.985
Come on.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.784
Look, Nelly.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.999
- Father.
- Ah!

10:35.000 --> 10:37.799
At last we have a full company.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.159
Mrs. Ternan, welcome.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.479
What a beautiful theater
you've built.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.839
Thank you.
I'm glad, we have tried.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.719
- Miss Maria, welcome.
- Thank you.

10:45.720 --> 10:46.879
You had a good journey, I hope.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.919
Yes, thank you, Mr. Dickens.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.479
- Quite comfortable.
- Good. Good. Good.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.511
- And you must be Miss Ellen Ternan?
- I am.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.599
You've met my eldest son,
Charley, of course?

10:54.600 --> 10:57.079
- He kindly rescued my glove, yes.
- Ah.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.479
The gallant chevalier.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.839
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce Miss Ellen

11:00.840 --> 11:02.959
who is helping us
in our hour of need.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.799
We wish your sister, Fanny, well.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.159
Is it the Haymarket or the Phoenix
Theater we've lost her to?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.239
The Haymarket.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.519
She's so sad not to be here.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.239
No, Nelly will give you
a wonderful performance.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.399
I have no doubt.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.799
Now, Mrs. Ternan, Maria, you've met

11:13.800 --> 11:15.639
everyone on our
previous rehearsals.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.639
Miss Ellen, may I introduce
our family of actors?

11:18.640 --> 11:20.959
- We have Mr. Lemon.
- Delighted.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.079
- And Mr. Egg.
- Welcome.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.279
- And our composer, Mr. Berger.
- Hello.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.359
And Mr. Pigott.
Miss Sabine. Mr. Charles.

11:28.360 --> 11:33.279
And I'd like to introduce our author,
Mr. Collins, but as ever, he is late.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.199
But here are some
of my own family.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.559
My daughters, Mamey, Katey.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.599
My sister-in-law,
Miss Georgina Hogarth.

11:39.600 --> 11:43.279
Assorted sons, Frank,
Alfred, Sydney, Henry.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.159
And where is youngest boy?

11:45.160 --> 11:47.919
Don't hide there, Plorn. Come here.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.559
And that is it, I think.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.067
Uh, yes, of course, and my wife.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.279
And half an hour.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.599
Is that time enough, ladies, for
you to settle your bonnets?

11:55.600 --> 11:58.479
I'd like to rehearse,
but without our author,

11:58.480 --> 12:01.239
Mr. Collins, who is at last here.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.119
Why am I always waiting, Wilkie?

12:03.120 --> 12:04.679
Why must you always be late?

12:04.680 --> 12:06.799
Because it irritates you, Charles.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.228
And it amuses me to
see you in bad temper.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.079
Charles, I don't think
we can afford to cut it.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.879
But it's too long.
It'll bore if it's too long.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.159
It was too long in London, it'll
be too long in Manchester.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.519
Though it pains, Wilkie.
Cut, cut, cut.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.959
It is done.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.039
You can tell Mr. Egg
he's lost his last soliloquy.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.559
No, you must do it as author.
I shall not deny you that.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.559
You are insufferable. And this?

12:25.560 --> 12:27.079
And here and here.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.319
Now, everyone, please be careful.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.199
Our little theater's
not yet complete.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.519
Remember, we are rehearsing Miss Ellen
in today, so let's be considerate.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.279
Now I'm keen to review
the last act,

12:36.280 --> 12:38.479
just the final entry
of Wardour and Aldersly.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.039
So places, friends.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.399
- Now, Maria. Maria.
- Yes.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.639
We should have
you just here, I think.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.999
Then Mrs. Ternan and the girls.
And Miss Ellen...

12:46.000 --> 12:48.639
Mr. Dickens, may I suggest that the
ladies are slightly further upstage?

12:48.640 --> 12:49.759
Yes. Of course.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.319
Have your officers
trimmed to your satisfaction?

12:51.320 --> 12:52.759
Yes, excellent, excellent.
Very good.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.879
Um, do you think I ought to stand
a little wider for the entrance?

12:54.880 --> 12:56.879
Yes, but not too much for
it's your face and not mine

12:56.880 --> 12:59.399
that'll be holding the attention
of our audience, I feel sure.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.519
Uh, Wilkie, are you ready?

13:00.520 --> 13:03.079
I need you standing at the
back if I'm to carry you in.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.223
- Are you ready?
- No.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.679
- Yes, come on, come on.
- Yes, yes.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.799
Charley. Just relax the arms.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.839
Just a little less stiff.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.999
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.301
That's good, yes.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.199
Should you not come?
I cannot carry myself.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.919
Yes, yes, of course.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.359
Do I speak after the gun?

13:21.360 --> 13:24.679
After the gun and you move
downstage to the middle.

13:24.680 --> 13:25.919
Frank! Frank!

13:25.920 --> 13:28.359
Then my line,
"Saved, saved for you."

13:28.360 --> 13:30.399
- Then you've put me down here.
- Yes, I have.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.864
And I am footsore and
weary, Clara, but I have saved him.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.639
Yes. That's good.
Then your line, Wilkie.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.599
Where is Wardour?
Help him. Never mind me.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.959
Mark, that's when you come down.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.399
Wardour. Dear Wardour.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.559
Old friend whom I have wronged,
remember and forgive me.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.839
Very good, you're forgiven.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.759
Don't be afraid to project. We
have nearly a thousand seats.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.869
Catherine, do say
if you cannot hear us.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.199
- What?
- We can hear you very well, Charles.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.919
Very good. Everyone speak up.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.839
Then, Maria, that's when
you come over here

13:59.840 --> 14:01.439
and take me gently in your arms.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.639
- Here.
- Sorry.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.159
Richard. Richard,
look upon your old playmate.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.439
And then music...

14:06.440 --> 14:07.559
No, Berger... Berger, not yet.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.679
I'm just marking through the cues.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.439
It plays until
the curtain has fallen

14:10.440 --> 14:12.199
by which time we kiss, then gun.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.990
Bang. Then I'm dead.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.545
And then epilogue.

14:22.720 --> 14:26.741
This is a tale of woe.
This is a tale of sorrow.

14:26.800 --> 14:31.039
A love denied. A love restored
to live beyond tomorrow.

14:31.040 --> 14:34.759
Lest we think silence is the
place to hide a heavy heart,

14:34.760 --> 14:40.385
remember, to love and be loved is life
itself without which we are nought.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.239
And then the curtain closes.
Loud applause.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.862
Yet audible the crying of 2,000!

14:51.440 --> 14:53.879
Thank you. Bravo. Bravo.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.679
Ladies, gentlemen.
Thank you, Maria.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.999
Charles, your last speech
I think could benefit from cutting.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.759
- You do?
- I do.

15:00.760 --> 15:01.999
Shall we discuss it?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.745
Uh, yes, yeah. Later.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.906
She has something.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.305
Come nearer.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.661
Clara.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.871
Kiss me.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.586
Sister, kiss me

15:26.800 --> 15:28.864
- before I die.
- No.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.261
William Thackeray!

16:21.080 --> 16:24.519
No, no, no. it is not enough that
we play before these mere mortals.

16:24.520 --> 16:28.399
Friends, it is Manchester who has
given us the highest accolade.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.359
It is Manchester whose
approval I have looked for,

16:31.360 --> 16:35.319
and it is Manchester who has
bestowed tonight's success.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.079
Friends, we are victorious!

16:39.280 --> 16:42.559
Sir Roger de Coverley,
Mr. Berger, please.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.279
And again!

17:01.280 --> 17:02.991
Strip the willow!

17:12.319 --> 17:14.145
Back-to-back!

17:21.000 --> 17:24.667
Gentlemen, change for
the <i>British Grenadiers.</i>

17:50.160 --> 17:53.464
Raise your arms higher like a bird.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.839
And then, when you are
ready, give me your hands.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.199
It's remarkable.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.740
Give me your hands.

18:01.240 --> 18:04.066
There. Now you are safe with me.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.429
One of his magic tricks.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.024
Where are you?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.825
I'm on my own.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.359
You are an admirer of my
husband's work, Miss Ellen?

18:19.360 --> 18:21.025
Of course.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.599
At the moment,
I'm lost in <i>Little Dorrit.</i>

18:23.600 --> 18:25.519
Until now, I thought <i>Bleak House</i>

18:25.520 --> 18:27.119
would be the novel that would
stay with me the most.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.439
It has this alarming spirit
of unease.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.664
Lady Dedlock haunted by her past.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.822
I keep coming back to those
pages again and again.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.479
Yet there's so much
that makes me smile.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.279
'Tis a fiction
designed to entertain.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.663
Surely it's more than that.
It changes us.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.439
Now you are, you are back with us.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.102
He will be up all night.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.119
And cross all day.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.239
Katey. Mamey.

19:04.240 --> 19:08.239
Now, someone else. Who is next?

19:08.240 --> 19:09.666
Hmm?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.426
- Who is next?
- Good night.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.519
<i>Hold the baby.
Hold the baby. She's gone.</i>

19:15.520 --> 19:19.719
Where is she? Where is she? Is she
safe? Please tell me she's safe.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.990
And now you are back
with us, Mrs. Ternan.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.068
- Back where?
- Mother.

19:28.440 --> 19:32.319
Mother, I think you were
remembering Fanny on the boat.

19:32.320 --> 19:33.839
Oh. What did I say?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.347
- You were trying to save her, Mother.
- Oh.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.279
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickens.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.079
I think I may have strayed
into some family history.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.381
Oh?

19:43.360 --> 19:47.631
My eldest daughter, Fanny,
was, um, thrown from her cot.

19:47.640 --> 19:51.023
My husband and I were traveling
around America some years ago,

19:52.160 --> 19:55.828
and, um, our paddle steamer
was rammed by another boat,

19:56.840 --> 20:00.999
and Fanny was thrown
up into the air

20:01.000 --> 20:03.587
and saved, miraculously,
by a mattress.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.679
The angels were watching.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.425
- Yes.
- They were.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.267
Extraordinary story.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.079
I am done, Mr. Dickens.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.079
As am I. I must go.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.759
Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.300
- Good night, Wilkie.
- Good night.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.821
5:00.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.788
- Bed.
- Or breakfast?

20:25.280 --> 20:26.706
Good night.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.079
Thank you, gentlemen.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.319
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.719
Maria, you broke all our hearts tonight.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.999
Everyone was weeping.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.999
I couldn't hold back the tears.
You were so good.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.319
I did try to console her
in a hushed aside,

20:40.320 --> 20:43.479
but all she could say was,
"Oh, so sad, so sad."

20:43.480 --> 20:46.519
Such a good,
dear, pale little face.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.999
You won't find a better Clara.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.159
Thank you, Mother.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.319
I must get my angels to bed.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.839
I'm too awake to sleep.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.824
- It's daylight.
- Nelly.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.669
Everyone needs sleep, Nelly dear.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.388
This is my favorite time.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.679
When the day is creeping up on us

21:11.680 --> 21:14.599
and we must put in order
the chaos of the night.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.824
Stand guard once more,
ready for life.

21:19.880 --> 21:23.548
A wonderful fact to reflect
upon, that every human creature

21:23.760 --> 21:27.348
is a profound secret
and mystery to every other.

21:28.760 --> 21:32.269
Until that secret is
given to another to look after.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.546
And then perhaps two human
creatures may know each other.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.861
Do you not think?

21:47.400 --> 21:48.701
Yeah.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.541
Has Mrs. Dickens gone to bed?

21:55.240 --> 21:56.639
Some time ago.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.226
Mmm, yeah, well...

21:59.320 --> 22:01.782
She has terrible headaches.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.588
Sleep.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.629
Why must you do that?

22:27.440 --> 22:29.265
Do what, Nelly?

22:29.440 --> 22:32.119
Flaunt my connection?

22:32.120 --> 22:33.239
It is dull.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.759
Dull?

22:34.760 --> 22:36.919
To have known Dickens?

22:36.920 --> 22:38.665
I was a child.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.424
Yet to refer to him as bleak.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.999
It is a misconception.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.119
What?

22:47.120 --> 22:49.719
I do not understand what
you are talking of, Nelly.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.749
This constant agitation.

23:28.480 --> 23:32.479
<i>"As we struggled on,
nearer and nearer to the sea</i>

23:32.480 --> 23:36.079
<i>"from which this mighty wind
was blowing dead on shore,</i>

23:36.080 --> 23:39.702
<i>"its force became more
and more terrific.</i>

23:40.840 --> 23:43.559
<i>"When we came
within sight of the sea,</i>

23:43.560 --> 23:48.359
<i>"the waves on the horizon, caught at
intervals above the rolling abyss,</i>

23:48.360 --> 23:53.279
"were like glimpses of another
shore with towers and buildings.

23:53.280 --> 23:56.279
"As the high watery walls
came rolling in,

23:56.280 --> 23:58.981
"and at their highest
tumbled into surf,

23:59.040 --> 24:03.550
"they looked as if the least
would engulf the town.

24:04.040 --> 24:10.039
"As the receding wave swept
back with a hoarse roar,

24:10.040 --> 24:13.559
"it seemed to scoop out
deep caves in the beach,

24:13.560 --> 24:17.910
"as if its purpose were
to undermine the earth.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.948
"Ham watched the sea,
standing alone,

24:23.280 --> 24:26.399
"until there was
a great retiring wave.

24:26.400 --> 24:30.039
"When, with a backward glance
at those who held the rope

24:30.040 --> 24:34.709
"which was made fast around his
body, he dashed in after it.

24:34.880 --> 24:38.999
"And, in a moment,
was buffeting with the water,

24:39.000 --> 24:44.439
"rising with the hills, falling with
the valleys, lost beneath the foam,

24:44.440 --> 24:49.223
"borne in towards the shore,
borne on towards the ship.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.239
"At last Ham neared the wreck.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.079
"He was so near that with one
more of his vigorous strokes,

24:55.080 --> 24:56.839
"he would be clinging to it

24:56.840 --> 25:02.759
"when a high, green,
vast hillside of water

25:02.760 --> 25:05.439
"moving on shoreward
from beyond the ship,

25:05.440 --> 25:11.907
"he seemed to leap up into it
with a mighty bound.

25:15.760 --> 25:19.951
"And the ship was gone."

25:20.240 --> 25:22.759
Truly, Mr. Dickens,
it is never so alive

25:22.760 --> 25:24.599
as when it is spoken
by its author.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.709
Thank you. Thank you.
Will you excuse me?

25:26.960 --> 25:29.359
- Ah, Mrs. Ternan.
- Mr. Dickens.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.959
It was remarkable.

25:30.960 --> 25:34.319
Such control, such mastery
in your performance.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.439
Thank you. I am told
these readings double sales.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.199
It was quite brilliant,
Mr. Dickens.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.039
- It was?
- Yes. Yes.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.626
- Absolutely.
- Miss Fanny.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.159
We've missed you.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.508
Well, not enough, it would seem.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.999
- Mrs. Dickens isn't here?
- Uh, no, not today.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.621
- Oh, what a pity to have missed it.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.359
Oh, such a storm.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.399
We were quite blown off course.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.879
- So, it did not disappoint?
- No.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.182
- Well...
- Well?

26:02.920 --> 26:05.399
Nelly has read
every chapter twice.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.719
I may have read
every chapter twice,

26:07.720 --> 26:11.024
but I didn't really
hear it until now.

26:11.640 --> 26:16.264
Hearing it spoken,
I felt I was in the storm.

26:17.160 --> 26:21.306
I was there with Copperfield
seeing his friend drowned.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.159
It was unbearable.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.825
Yes, I...

26:26.760 --> 26:28.999
I am glad.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.159
Charles, do please come
and talk to these gentlemen.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.079
I've been entertaining them
for several minutes now,

26:33.080 --> 26:35.159
but ultimately I feel
I am a poor substitute.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.839
Wilkie, I am coming.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.359
Where are you playing next?

26:39.360 --> 26:41.119
They're engaged to play
Doncaster for three weeks.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.199
And what are you playing?

26:42.200 --> 26:43.999
Uh, two tragedies and a farce.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.199
Ah, a farce. What farce?

26:45.200 --> 26:47.039
<i>The Pet of the Petticoats.</i>

26:47.040 --> 26:50.719
<i>The Pet of the Petticoats?</i>
What a terrible title.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.999
Yes.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.187
Well, um...

26:55.200 --> 26:59.061
But very good races, Doncaster.
Excuse me. Don't go away.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.946
Catherine.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.101
Yes?

27:20.320 --> 27:22.065
Shall we sit together?

27:23.400 --> 27:24.879
If you wish.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.719
Well, no, if you'd
prefer not, I, um...

27:26.720 --> 27:28.999
I did not sleep well last night.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.559
Perhaps I will go to bed now.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.703
Yes, of course, yes.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.599
Wilkie has an idea for
<i>Household Words.</i>

27:35.600 --> 27:37.199
A trip to the North.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.079
He's calling it <i>A Lazy Tour
of Two Idle Apprentices.</i>

27:41.200 --> 27:43.104
It might be a couple
of pages in it.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.430
- Where will you start?
- Um...

27:45.800 --> 27:47.919
- Doncaster, I think.
- Hmm.

27:47.920 --> 27:48.959
Turn up the lamp.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.831
You cannot write in this light.

28:49.880 --> 28:52.559
She won! She won!

28:52.560 --> 28:54.759
Nelly, victory.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.159
Nelly, you've won!

28:59.160 --> 29:00.839
- How much?
- 5 shillings.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.079
5 shillings?

29:02.080 --> 29:03.839
It was fixed. It was fixed.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.039
I hope you're not
a bad sport, Mr. Collins.

29:06.040 --> 29:09.319
- I am a very bad sport.
- Then you must win.

29:09.320 --> 29:11.119
So, what will you do
with your winnings, Nelly?

29:11.120 --> 29:13.039
I shall spend it all at once.

29:13.040 --> 29:16.559
No, I may spend a half a shilling
on a copy of <i>Household Words</i>

29:16.560 --> 29:18.999
just to be sure
the two apprentices

29:19.000 --> 29:21.039
returned safely
from their lazy tour.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.959
They did, though they did
not want to go home.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.159
But what of their families?

29:24.160 --> 29:26.199
Well, they missed them of course,

29:26.200 --> 29:27.959
but they did so enjoy being away.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.919
Charles Dickens.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.959
Charles, you've been rumbled.

29:31.960 --> 29:33.199
Mr. Dickens.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.479
Hello. Good day. Yes. Thank you.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.199
How very unexpected.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.159
Thank you. Thank you.

29:39.160 --> 29:42.270
Welcome to Yorkshire. Will
you write a book about us?

29:43.760 --> 29:46.062
Mr. Dickens, great talking to you.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.039
Miss Ellen.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.830
- Mr. Dickens.
- Thank you.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.359
- I've read all your stories.
- Thank you.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.343
Through there, please.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.025
- Watch it!
- Yes, ma'am.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.199
Give me that, Maria dear.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.239
Thank you, Mother.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.542
Nearly there.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.239
Oh, home.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.719
Home.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.624
That's yours.

30:21.240 --> 30:23.781
- Does that need washing, do you think?
- I'll put it in.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.079
This will not stretch
to another season.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.439
I cannot mend another sleeve again.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.439
The cuffs are still good.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.980
And there's lace
on the collar I can save.

30:37.080 --> 30:38.239
Yes, I'll unpick it.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.269
Maria, also this hem.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.984
Thank you. Look.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.425
I'm collecting washing.

31:09.800 --> 31:10.959
Here.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.541
This signed?

31:19.800 --> 31:22.307
- A souvenir.
- Where are my scissors?

31:23.040 --> 31:24.580
They're in the drawer.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.786
It's to be treasured.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.510
Oh, Catherine.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.144
Um, excuse me.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.545
Why are you up so early?

32:57.720 --> 33:00.022
- I must go to London.
- Now?

33:00.320 --> 33:01.639
There will be no train.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.079
Well, then I shall walk.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.719
It will take you all day.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.022
Then it will take me all day.

33:33.080 --> 33:36.119
<i>So, here's perverseness.</i>

33:37.280 --> 33:41.119
No, no, 'tis Charles only
whom you would prefer.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.759
'Tis evident his vices and
follies have won your heart.

33:44.760 --> 33:49.199
I have obeyed you, both in neither
seeing nor corresponding with him.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.079
Yet I cannot think it culpable if,

33:51.080 --> 33:54.479
though my understanding
severely condemns his vices,

33:54.480 --> 33:58.421
my heart professes some...

33:59.440 --> 34:03.639
Suggests some pity
for his distresses.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.958
Egad, we'll have the
wedding tomorrow morning.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.719
Thank you, dear uncle.

34:10.719 --> 34:13.799
What, you rogue, don't you ask
the girl's consent first?

34:13.800 --> 34:15.518
I have done that a long time...

34:15.520 --> 34:18.998
- A minute ago and she looked...
- Be hard to believe she was so bad.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.839
- Yes.
- For shame, Charles.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.839
I protest, Sir Peter.
There has not been a word.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.759
Because we can't hear a word!

34:26.280 --> 34:28.184
Well, then the fewer the better.

34:28.719 --> 34:31.518
May your love for each other
never know abatement.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.839
And may you live
as happily together

34:33.840 --> 34:37.839
as Lady Teazle and I intend to do.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.679
That was very good, Nelly.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.839
Really, Mother?

34:41.840 --> 34:44.279
There is such clarity
in your performance, Nelly.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.079
Oh, thank you, Fanny.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.039
- You looked so beautiful.
- Thank you, Maria.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.239
Mr. Dickens, why didn't you
tell us you were coming?

34:50.239 --> 34:51.679
A last minute impulse.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.559
- Mr. Dickens.
- My dear Buckstone.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.319
Always a pleasure to have
you grace our theater.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.679
Thank you. A memorable night.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.599
Miss Ellen,
you were simply splendid.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.559
Oh, thank you, Mr. Arnott.
As were you.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.719
And how is the writing,
Mr. Dickens?

35:04.720 --> 35:06.399
My writing is ferocious.

35:06.400 --> 35:10.959
I'm up at 7:00, cold bath before
breakfast, then I blaze away until 3:00.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.989
I fight not to be distracted.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.345
Won't you sit?

35:15.560 --> 35:17.759
No, I don't think.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.039
It's very late. You must
be tired, Mr. Dickens.

35:20.040 --> 35:23.199
There's so much to do, I don't
know whether my head is on or off.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.879
Nelly, you must come
and meet my very good friends.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.501
Thank you. Yes, Mr. Arnott,
I'd be delighted to.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.719
- This is Ambrose.
- Hello.

35:32.720 --> 35:35.261
- She is much in demand.
- Mmm, indeed.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.399
Come through. Come through.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.239
Thank you, Mrs. Ternan.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.399
- Fanny, Maria, we need to feed our guest.
- Yes, Mother.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.159
Please do not trouble
yourself, Mrs. Ternan.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.359
There is some meat in the larder.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.399
And some fruit. And bread.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.704
Nelly, would you bring a
drink for Mr. Dickens?

35:54.760 --> 35:57.347
This is enchanting.

35:58.840 --> 36:02.861
Ah, I see you have
Mr. Keene as the Moor.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.719
I played his Desdemona. May I
take your coat, Mr. Dickens?

36:05.720 --> 36:07.759
I know. Thank you, Mrs. Ternan.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.079
And my husband was Iago.

36:10.080 --> 36:13.748
Indeed. "Farewell
the tranquil mind."

36:15.240 --> 36:17.479
- Thank you.
- Uh, would you sit?

36:17.480 --> 36:19.839
It is the only chair in
the house that doesn't sag

36:19.840 --> 36:21.439
should you shift
in search of comfort.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.981
Well, I am warned. Thank you.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.439
We have ham and plums.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.279
And some bread and some cheese.

36:34.280 --> 36:36.519
This is charming.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.359
And Wine.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.119
Then I shall never leave.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.639
- Oh, watch the...
- Sorry.

36:41.640 --> 36:44.039
And I didn't know how
I could get rid of him.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.359
And then what did you say?

36:45.360 --> 36:46.639
Well, what I should have said was,

36:46.640 --> 36:49.959
"Mr. Andersen, though your
<i>Ugly Duckling</i> has delighted,

36:49.960 --> 36:54.799
"you've slept in this room for five
weeks now and you must go home."

36:54.800 --> 36:56.679
- But you did not.
- I did not.

36:56.680 --> 36:57.759
Why didn't you?

36:57.760 --> 36:59.199
He doesn't understand English.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.639
He only speaks Danish, and I'm
not sure he understands Danish.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.959
I was tempted to learn his
language so I could say to him,

37:04.960 --> 37:07.879
"May you never outstay your
welcome so long again."

37:11.800 --> 37:14.839
And now it seems that
I have done the same.

37:14.840 --> 37:15.999
No, never.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.159
I will thank you, ladies,
for a pleasurable night.

37:19.160 --> 37:22.239
Life is nothing
without good company.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.668
Congratulations, Nelly,
on your performance.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.665
Thank you.

37:26.880 --> 37:30.319
Good night, ladies.
Ladies, good night.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.190
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.559
This is a very pretty cottage.

37:35.560 --> 37:38.147
Thank you. If a little small.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.679
The rewards of our profession
are rarely monetary.

37:42.680 --> 37:44.159
But I would have it no other way.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.519
No one is entirely
useless in this world

37:46.520 --> 37:49.679
if they may lighten the burden.

37:49.680 --> 37:52.187
I didn't know he was
going to be there.

37:52.680 --> 37:55.426
My daughters are fine young women.

37:56.760 --> 38:00.428
Sometimes, I'm anxious
for their future.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.039
I understand.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.820
If I may be of assistance
in any way?

38:08.720 --> 38:10.988
I cannot risk Nelly's reputation.

38:14.080 --> 38:18.021
I hope that nothing I could
offer would compromise her.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.879
Good night, Mrs. Ternan.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.864
Good night, Mr. Dickens.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.679
Good night, ladies.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.061
Good night.

39:03.240 --> 39:04.985
Come on out.

39:06.480 --> 39:09.784
Shilling a blow, sir?
Shilling a blow?

39:13.680 --> 39:18.827
I shall give you 5 if you
go home safely tonight.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.559
I can play house, sir.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.191
Want me as your wife, sir?

39:24.920 --> 39:26.919
Where is your mother?

40:01.200 --> 40:04.106
<i>Last night, I sat next to
a gentleman at dinner,</i>

40:05.040 --> 40:07.639
<i>and he asked me in some fury</i>

40:07.640 --> 40:13.390
<i>why it was that our city should help
those who do not help themselves.</i>

40:14.080 --> 40:17.959
<i>By "those" he meant
the many fallen women</i>

40:17.960 --> 40:20.069
<i>that we see around us every day,</i>

40:20.360 --> 40:24.984
<i>and their offspring, many who
rely on this hospital today.</i>

40:25.640 --> 40:27.839
<i>I replied,</i>

40:27.840 --> 40:31.839
<i>"The two grim nurses,
poverty and sickness,</i>

40:31.840 --> 40:36.199
<i>"bring these children before you
and preside over their births,</i>

40:36.200 --> 40:38.319
<i>"rock their wretched cradles,</i>

40:38.320 --> 40:41.359
<i>"nail down their little coffins,</i>

40:41.360 --> 40:44.391
<i>"pile up the earth
above their graves.</i>

40:44.440 --> 40:48.479
"Their unnatural deaths
form one third

40:48.480 --> 40:51.465
"of the annual deaths
in this great town."

40:52.600 --> 40:56.188
"But what of God?"
he piously replied.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.023
"What Of him?" I said.

40:59.960 --> 41:04.319
"I feel sure God looks
leniently on all vice

41:04.320 --> 41:09.706
"that proceeds from human
tenderness and natural passion."

41:10.040 --> 41:13.759
I hope we will, too,
and give generously tonight.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.061
Thank you.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.342
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Good night, sir.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.070
Thank you, ma'am.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.945
- Good night.
- Thank you, My Lord.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.468
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.479
- Good night.
- Thank you.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.590
Oh, I'm sure you can do
better than that, sir.

41:51.080 --> 41:55.079
Maria. Fanny. Nelly.
Have we fleeced them?

41:55.080 --> 41:58.319
With every ounce
of our souls, Mr. Dickens.

41:58.320 --> 41:59.399
Thank you. Thank you.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.119
I did not believe we would
raise so much money.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.279
Where does one begin?

42:02.280 --> 42:03.799
They'll take some counting.

42:03.800 --> 42:04.999
Yes. Yes.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.119
Such an achievement.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.239
We must celebrate.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.799
Yes! We must!

42:08.800 --> 42:10.359
We shall.

42:10.360 --> 42:14.399
Here we are. Please,
Mrs. Ternan, come through.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.479
Are you moving
in or out, Mr. Dickens?

42:16.480 --> 42:18.399
I'm thinking of letting it.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.799
My wife prefers to live
outside of the public glare.

42:20.800 --> 42:21.999
London tires her

42:22.000 --> 42:24.319
and Gad's Hill is where she likes
to retreat with the children.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.079
Gad's Hill near Rochester?

42:26.080 --> 42:27.759
Indeed, very close.
Walking distance.

42:27.760 --> 42:28.959
Nelly was born in Rochester.

42:28.960 --> 42:30.999
Ah, I was schooled in Chatham.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.519
But my earliest memories
are of Newcastle.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.959
Newcastle I do not know so well.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.599
Please, sit down.
Make yourselves at home.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.879
We have champagne.

42:40.880 --> 42:43.228
Thank you, John.
Please, on the piano.

42:50.320 --> 42:53.799
Now did you ever see
Mr. Keene's <i>Corsican Brothers?</i>

42:53.800 --> 42:58.310
Interesting. I saw that melodrama
many, many years ago...

43:46.200 --> 43:47.839
Nelly.

43:47.840 --> 43:50.759
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mr. Dickens. We must leave you.

43:50.760 --> 43:53.239
Fanny has an audition in the
morning and must rest her voice.

43:53.240 --> 43:54.439
But, of course, of course.

43:54.440 --> 43:55.879
Uh, we have a wager, Mr. Dickens,

43:55.880 --> 43:57.679
on how much we collected tonight.

43:57.680 --> 44:00.279
I think 400 pounds,
but Fanny thinks more.

44:00.280 --> 44:01.559
Then I shall count it right away.

44:01.560 --> 44:02.719
It must be banked tomorrow.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.199
You'll be up all night.

44:04.200 --> 44:05.559
Well, I don't sleep well anyway.

44:05.560 --> 44:06.839
Why don't we help you?

44:06.840 --> 44:08.199
Together it will take us no time.

44:08.200 --> 44:09.799
- We have a rehearsal in the morning.
- No.

44:09.800 --> 44:12.439
I could stay and help,
Mr. Dickens, with Nelly.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.868
- If you have no objection.
- No, I...

44:17.920 --> 44:20.427
Well, yes, thank you. Thank you.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.839
Well, then, I shall
walk home with Fanny.

44:22.840 --> 44:23.919
- Very well.
- Thank you, Mr. Dickens.

44:23.920 --> 44:25.879
Thank you. Good night,
Maria. Good night, Fanny.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.625
We shan't be long.

44:41.560 --> 44:45.079
507 pounds,

44:45.080 --> 44:48.748
six shillings and thruppence.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.026
- We are rich.
- Yes.

44:51.600 --> 44:54.062
And they will be delighted

44:55.120 --> 44:57.229
until the next time.

45:03.800 --> 45:06.023
Do you like this life?

45:07.800 --> 45:09.864
Constantly on show.

45:11.800 --> 45:13.399
Constantly watched.

45:13.400 --> 45:17.102
Well, it is not always
of my own making, but...

45:19.880 --> 45:22.182
I do not think I would.

45:24.320 --> 45:27.119
Well, I have my work.

45:27.120 --> 45:29.639
It is a great foil.

45:29.640 --> 45:34.628
They try, but they cannot
always find you there.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.599
"They"?

45:36.600 --> 45:38.479
Mmm, the hawkers,

45:38.480 --> 45:42.319
the men who need to make money
who look to trip you up.

45:42.320 --> 45:44.559
And then there are the admirers.

45:44.560 --> 45:50.999
Those who wish you to be more
than you can possibly be.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.631
And what is that?

45:53.520 --> 45:56.141
Good, I suppose.

46:12.160 --> 46:17.387
My father was sent to a
debtor's prison when I was 12.

46:18.080 --> 46:21.879
I worked in a blacking factory
thereafter,

46:21.880 --> 46:24.660
sealing bottles
and sticking labels.

46:27.080 --> 46:28.984
It was hateful.

46:29.840 --> 46:32.541
- Were you fond of your father?
- Well...

46:33.720 --> 46:36.559
He was my first audience.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.022
I honed my comic lines on him.

46:41.160 --> 46:43.079
Mmm...

46:43.080 --> 46:46.239
I've told you too much.

46:46.240 --> 46:49.384
You're too good at this.
You, now, you.

46:51.600 --> 46:54.559
My father was an actor.

46:54.560 --> 46:58.719
The son of a Dublin grocer.
Also in debt. Also dead.

46:58.720 --> 47:00.351
When I was seven.

47:01.560 --> 47:03.544
In an asylum.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.585
I had a brother.

47:09.120 --> 47:11.343
He died at 10 months.

47:11.720 --> 47:15.342
Though how a boy would have
fit with three girls.

47:24.440 --> 47:26.504
She is devoted to us.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.464
Our life is unpredictable.

47:39.960 --> 47:41.705
You are...

47:42.320 --> 47:43.746
What?

47:44.720 --> 47:46.909
You are so free.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.079
She will sleep all night
if we leave her.

47:58.080 --> 48:00.759
I will ask John to bring
the carriage around.

48:00.760 --> 48:02.061
Nelly?

48:02.800 --> 48:04.306
Nelly?

48:10.240 --> 48:11.780
Tell me a secret.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.959
What kind of secret?

48:16.960 --> 48:18.319
Anything.

48:18.320 --> 48:20.239
Something that
you've never told anyone

48:20.240 --> 48:22.588
or perhaps never even
thought of telling.

48:25.640 --> 48:28.307
My middle name is Lawless.

48:31.840 --> 48:33.187
Now your turn.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.266
Hmm.

48:40.160 --> 48:43.509
Ellen Lawless Ternan.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.628
That is my secret.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.543
She's barely 18.

49:14.520 --> 49:18.950
I've never had to concern
myself about you and Maria.

49:20.040 --> 49:23.919
There's always a tour for you
and your younger sister.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.879
Mr. Buckstone's already enquired

49:25.880 --> 49:28.467
if Maria is free for pantomime.

49:30.520 --> 49:32.185
But Nelly...

49:34.560 --> 49:36.191
Nelly is different.

49:37.880 --> 49:40.069
Her talent lies elsewhere.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.710
I love her.

49:45.240 --> 49:47.383
I love her dearly.

49:48.440 --> 49:55.066
Charles Dickens is not merely some
opportunist, some adventurer.

49:55.280 --> 50:00.063
I am thinking about what
this life can offer her.

50:00.760 --> 50:03.079
I'm thinking about her future.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.984
What future would that be, Mother?

50:08.480 --> 50:11.199
Our profession is hard enough,
even if you have talent.

50:34.800 --> 50:36.319
Go away, Fanny.

50:36.320 --> 50:38.668
I will stay out here
all day if I have to.

50:39.480 --> 50:40.986
Nelly.

50:43.080 --> 50:45.599
- Did no one think of telling me?
- Nelly.

50:45.600 --> 50:48.119
You are the truest person
I know in life,

50:48.120 --> 50:49.865
but you are not an actress.

50:50.560 --> 50:53.079
And what other arrangements have
been made which I do not know about?

50:53.080 --> 50:55.348
It's only because we care so.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.679
Do you love him?

51:04.800 --> 51:07.799
He is married.

51:07.800 --> 51:11.468
That has not stopped him
falling in love with you.

51:21.040 --> 51:23.159
We discussed <i>Hard Times,</i>

51:23.160 --> 51:26.464
but it just doesn't
feel quite right.

51:26.920 --> 51:30.279
I don't know. They're quite lost.

51:30.280 --> 51:31.839
So I thought <i>Great Expectations</i>

51:31.840 --> 51:33.279
might be a choice
for our readings.

51:33.280 --> 51:35.679
<i>David Copperfield</i> is,
of course, a contender,

51:35.680 --> 51:40.508
but for me, <i>Great Expectations</i>
wins out in the end.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.345
Do you agree?

51:46.040 --> 51:47.990
'Tis a fine novel.

51:54.320 --> 51:56.190
Mrs. Wharton Robinson,

51:56.680 --> 52:02.305
I see you are soulful, distracted.

52:04.040 --> 52:06.119
There is some...

52:06.120 --> 52:07.626
As if...

52:09.680 --> 52:12.347
...a part of you is absent.

52:13.200 --> 52:15.079
I do not wish to intrude.

52:15.080 --> 52:17.428
You talk, I am sure,
to your husband.

52:19.280 --> 52:20.399
No.

52:20.400 --> 52:22.668
Not all wives do.

52:23.520 --> 52:27.279
To confide in the person
you love the most,

52:27.280 --> 52:28.519
well, sometimes that is hard.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.549
George is a good man.

52:31.840 --> 52:34.079
- A very good man.
- Of course.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.269
But you are troubled.

52:37.360 --> 52:39.549
Comes and then it goes.

52:40.680 --> 52:42.709
But it returns.

52:46.200 --> 52:49.119
I wish to help you.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.839
I hope I can be someone
you can trust.

52:50.840 --> 52:53.950
- Really, I'm quite well.
- You are not.

52:55.600 --> 52:57.789
Please, Mr. Benham.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.470
I will listen without judgment.

53:07.480 --> 53:09.623
I am always here.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.759
Come on, boys.

53:26.760 --> 53:27.799
Come on, Plorn.

53:27.800 --> 53:30.599
The whole point of the third
leg is to give you more speed.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.119
Oh!

53:33.120 --> 53:34.945
Useless boy.

53:35.640 --> 53:37.783
It's time to get you undone.

53:38.080 --> 53:39.319
What's happened here?

53:39.320 --> 53:40.759
Do you have enough to eat?

53:40.760 --> 53:42.505
- Thank you, Mr. Dickens.
- Good.

53:51.040 --> 53:53.627
More gossip in <i>The London Diary?</i>

53:59.840 --> 54:03.959
You could not keep it
quiet forever, Charles.

54:03.960 --> 54:06.519
No matter. You must deny it.

54:06.520 --> 54:08.982
Rumors can always be denied.

54:09.840 --> 54:12.839
Do not worry, it will pass.

54:12.840 --> 54:15.222
And then you must stop this.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.631
What if I do not want to?

54:19.520 --> 54:21.479
Don't be foolish.

54:21.480 --> 54:23.191
You cannot keep her a secret.

54:24.520 --> 54:26.310
Yes, I can.

54:29.520 --> 54:31.879
Plorn! We'll do a hopping race.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.959
Mamey. Katey. Come on. Come on.

54:33.960 --> 54:35.519
One leg. Come on, are you ready?

54:35.520 --> 54:37.719
Come here, come here, come here.

54:37.720 --> 54:40.919
Come on. Quickly, come on,
Plorn. You're so slow.

54:40.920 --> 54:44.079
And ready, steady, go!

54:44.080 --> 54:48.101
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

54:48.720 --> 54:51.500
Ladies, can I interest
you in some of this?

54:53.240 --> 54:55.039
- Close your eyes.
- Don't turn around, Nelly.

54:55.040 --> 54:56.626
Don't turn around.

54:57.680 --> 54:59.505
Close your eyes.

55:00.160 --> 55:04.199
Keep them closed until I say...

55:04.200 --> 55:07.344
Open your eyes! Happy birthday.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.430
Happy birthday.

55:12.600 --> 55:14.959
That's lovely. Oh, look.

55:17.720 --> 55:21.388
Ma'am, there's a Mrs. Dickens
to see Miss Ellen.

55:25.040 --> 55:26.387
Mother.

55:30.240 --> 55:32.349
I shall cut the cake.

55:32.400 --> 55:33.639
And he never went home again.

55:33.640 --> 55:34.799
And that was the first
and last time.

55:34.800 --> 55:37.262
Mr. Ambrose? Have you
ever took to the stage?

55:46.480 --> 55:48.225
Mrs. Dickens.

55:49.320 --> 55:51.702
I thought this was the right house.

55:54.640 --> 55:56.066
Won't you sit?

55:58.560 --> 55:59.839
Such attention to detail.

55:59.840 --> 56:02.666
It's all just paste and glass.

56:03.320 --> 56:05.907
You find us in disarray.

56:06.960 --> 56:10.839
I'd heard that he'd found you
somewhere close on the square.

56:10.840 --> 56:14.239
My mother and sister
are to go to Italy.

56:14.240 --> 56:16.907
Fanny is to be a governess
to the Trollope family.

56:17.760 --> 56:19.079
Really?

56:19.080 --> 56:23.101
Mr. Dickens, um, kindly
made the introduction.

56:27.960 --> 56:30.039
My husband's always
been very generous.

56:30.040 --> 56:31.580
Mmm.

56:46.640 --> 56:48.544
Happy birthday, Miss Ternan.

56:55.440 --> 56:56.787
Won't you open it?

56:59.200 --> 57:01.502
It is a gift from Charles.

57:02.360 --> 57:06.221
It was mistakenly delivered to me.

57:06.440 --> 57:08.390
The jewelers naturally believing.

57:16.200 --> 57:19.390
Charles insisted that I delivered
it to its rightful recipient.

57:28.720 --> 57:30.829
He is fond of you.

57:33.960 --> 57:35.466
And you of him?

57:37.080 --> 57:39.030
Silly question.

57:40.040 --> 57:42.661
He is Mr. Charles Dickens.

57:47.400 --> 57:49.479
In those early years together,

57:49.480 --> 57:51.828
I could not fail to be impressed.

57:54.240 --> 57:58.181
But you will find that you must
share him with his public.

57:59.400 --> 58:01.702
They will be the constant.

58:02.920 --> 58:06.559
And, in truth, you will
never absolutely know

58:06.560 --> 58:08.430
which one he loves the most.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.919
You.

58:13.920 --> 58:15.665
Or them.

58:17.440 --> 58:20.471
I do not believe he knows himself.

58:30.720 --> 58:32.159
I'm interrupting your party.

58:32.160 --> 58:34.839
I'm far too old for parties.

58:34.840 --> 58:38.639
There's not a soul
under 20 in attendance.

58:38.640 --> 58:41.466
Well, Charles will be here soon.

58:43.040 --> 58:45.104
And he's nothing if not youthful.

58:59.480 --> 59:01.399
Keep these for later.

59:03.560 --> 59:04.941
Ah.

59:09.120 --> 59:11.119
- Good evening.
- Happy birthday.

59:11.120 --> 59:12.759
Are we too late? We're too late.

59:12.760 --> 59:13.999
You've missed Maria's cake.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.879
Oh, no! Say it's not so. We haven't
missed all the fun, have we?

59:16.880 --> 59:18.999
We thought you might
provide the fun.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.479
Well, then there's
only one thing for it.

59:20.480 --> 59:22.959
We must whisk
the birthday girl away.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.599
Yes.

59:24.600 --> 59:25.901
Nelly.

59:27.480 --> 59:29.509
Say you'll come.

59:35.480 --> 59:37.111
Where are we going?

59:51.400 --> 59:54.159
Come through. Come in, come in.

59:54.160 --> 59:55.621
Caroline?

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.639
Nelly, follow me.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.987
Caroline.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.949
We have visitors.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.665
Wilkie, why did you not say?

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.479
We are celebrating
a very special birthday.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.319
Caroline, may I present
Miss Ellen Ternan?

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.479
It's her birthday today.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.431
Happy birthday. I've
heard only good things.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.861
Caroline!

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.719
A new painting.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.239
It's unusual. It's quite slap-up.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.719
Is The Butler about?

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.500
Yes, yes, she's about.
Ah, here she is.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.559
Squeals. There she is.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.839
Squeals. And she squeals.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.869
May I take your wrap and gloves?

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.666
Thank you.
I prefer to keep them on.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.903
Please.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.879
What a lovely home.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.119
Yes. Yes.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.184
Wilkie found it.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.231
Charles christened her "The
Butler" on their first meeting.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.599
It is all a game with him.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.550
She's very dear.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.471
Does this offend you, Miss Ternan?

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.902
Wilkie despises marriage, and
as a widow, this suits me well.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.583
We live very happily.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.228
But you do disapprove, I see.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.749
We have fallen in love with
men of standing, Miss Ternan.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.959
I am not in love.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.479
The giant's coming.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.147
It is late. Really.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.959
It is too, too late. I must leave.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.989
Please excuse me, Miss Graves.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.101
Charles, will you stay for dinner?

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.067
Nelly?

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.146
Mmm.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.639
And still she is silent.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.422
Mr. Buckstone has offered
me <i>The World and The Stage.</i>

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.628
It has a ridiculous plot.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.519
A titled lady saved from debt
by her sister, an actress.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.079
Yes, but a very
amusing final scene.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.826
And it was you that
secured me the role.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.399
Did you mean to deliberately
humiliate me tonight?

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.839
You did not like Miss Graves?

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.799
You cannot expect me
to associate with a woman

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.999
living so openly with a
man outside of marriage.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.879
- Oh, Nelly... Nelly... Nelly!
- Entertaining guests as if she“.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.990
I do not wish to appear ungrateful.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.382
You have been generous.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.504
Some might say too
generous to my family.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.188
But I did not realize that
I was to be your whore.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.980
Nelly.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.439
Nelly.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.039
Nelly, it was a mistake.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.239
- Did you send Catherine to me?
- Yes.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.999
She is the mother
of your children.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.439
How could you be so cruel to her?

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.879
And for that,
I shall always be grateful,

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.399
but I do not love her.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.719
She comprehends nothing.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.679
She sees nothing.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.119
I thought if she saw you,
then she would understand

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.785
that I have nothing with her.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.959
- I wanted her to see it.
- "It"?

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.342
What is "it," Charles?

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.550
What is it that we are?

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.548
When your wife asked me
if I was fond of you,

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.861
I could not honestly reply.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.304
I wanted to say no!

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.519
Can I be of assistance, sir?

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.279
Is this young lady
troubling you, sir?

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.599
Uh, thank you. She is not
troubling me at all. All is well.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.709
Very good. Good night, sir.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.839
Nelly?

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.630
Nelly.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.104
May I come in?

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.946
Nelly.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.159
I used to walk from
the Aldwych to Highgate,

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.799
then back to Westminster,
then on to Millbank.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.319
You've London in your blood.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.987
I do. I walk at quite a pace.

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:19.384
- Good day.
- Good day.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:26.118
And I'd walk to Putney and...

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.742
- I've done that walk.
- Yes.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.238
You don't believe me?

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.158
Father.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.700
Charley.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:40.305
What are you doing here?

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.359
I walk this way if I've
taken an earlier train.

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:45.238
You remember Miss Ellen?

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.359
Of course.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:48.238
Charley, you look well.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:51.038
I am quite well.
Thank you, Miss Ternan.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.078
Charley is working in the city.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.029
- How clever.
- Not really.

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:57.399
It's a friend of Father's.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:00.719
I still have the glove
which you rescued for me.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.319
I would have been most
unhappy to have lost it.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:04.519
They're my favorite pair.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.948
I am sure you would
have found another.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.599
Well, I am already late...

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.185
Yes, yes.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.425
Father.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.541
Will we see you at home?

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.541
Yes.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.541
Good day, Charley.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.425
Charley.

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:48.559
What is it?

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.145
It's a letter in <i>The Times.</i>

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.904
It's from Father.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.224
I can't read it.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.949
Would you read it?

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.950
Read it to me.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.479
"There is some domestic
trouble of mine,

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.559
"longstanding,

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.959

"My wife, Catherine, and I

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.879
<i>"touching upon my association</i>

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.548

<i>"for any false witness to lie

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.190
Thank you.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.743
He's an honorable man.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.599
And you, Nelly, are a beautiful...

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.790
- Mother.
- ...clever, wonderful young woman.

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.827
- But he cannot marry me.
- No.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.625
He cannot.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.951
But I have been married,

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.025
and it is at times
the loneliest place.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.030
What do I do?

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.661
Um...

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.879
Fanny and I leave for Italy
at the end of the month.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.750
You could come with us.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.559
Um...

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:42.784
I can arrange a passage.
It's easily done.

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.999
He's burnt a lifetime's
correspondence, Nelly. Nelly, listen.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.679
He's even asked me to burn
all our correspondence.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.399
There is an insanity
to his behavior.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.999
No, he's not insane.
He's distraught.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.519
And I am not?

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.679
You have a choice.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.399
You can distance
yourself from him.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.839
You could find a new life,
a different life.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.266
A different life?

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.679
What different life?

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.187
What life is there for me?

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.423
He is a good man...

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.670
Trying to be a good man.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.624
But he is a great man.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.189
You see him, Nelly.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.146
I watch you together.
You see him, he sees you.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.189
What more does one want in life?

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.150
- Wilkie.
- I'm coming.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.279
We have to break
these conventions.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.389
Smash them up.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.919
We're the pioneers.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.585
Pioneers?

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.919
You men,

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.190
you live your lives while
it is we who have to wait.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.867
You see a freedom
which I do not see.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.746
Wilkie.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.030
The Butler will not sleep
if I don't read to her.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.703
My name is whispered with yours.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.799
Yet I have nothing.

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.261
Nelly.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.679
- I have no regrets.
- Charles...

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.586
I have broken something
which needed breaking.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.119
I have finished it.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.079
Yes, it is finished.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.906
No, no, no. The book.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.104
I have finished the book. Here.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.470
You do not like it?

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.261
No.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.709
I like it.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.505
I like it very much.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.359
Wilkie thinks I should
change the ending.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.519
No, you must not.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.679
To bring Estella and Pip together
at the end but not to unite them.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.359
- She is changed. That is enough?
- Yes.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.359
It is a sad ending, but
Estella finds her heart.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.662
- She finds an understanding at last.
- Exactly.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.519
And at times...

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.759
Pip is not heroic.

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.319
He is filled with the vanities,

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.159
the ambitions,
the flaws in all of us.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.719
Yes.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.719
I know what I have done,

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.309
but to stay as it was,
I cannot when my heart...

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.866
Nelly.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:33.239
In an earlier chapter, Pip said,

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.670
"You are part of my
existence, part of myself."

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.039
I remember.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:44.439
"You have been in every
line I have ever read.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.999
"You have been in every
prospect I have ever seen,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.199
"on the river,
on the sails of the ships,

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.079
"on the marshes,
in the clouds, in the light,

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.679
"in the darkness,
in the wind, in the woods,

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.119
"in the sea, in the streets.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:07.439
"You have been the embodiment
of every graceful fancy

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.222
"that my mind has ever
become acquainted with.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.431
"Estella.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.422
"To the last hour of my life,

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:24.546
"you cannot choose but

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.262
"Part of the little good in me.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.741
"Part of the evil."

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.945
Let us go away.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:17.439
"'Now, touch my face with yours

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.999
"'in case I should not hold

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.399
"'I love you, Mortimer."'

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:23.559
"The discovery was hers.

In Manchester, Glasgow and Dublin.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.199
And I've been asked to
give a reading in Paris.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.185
- Shall I come with you?
- Well...

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.511
There are whisperings, Nelly.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.359
- Where?
- In Paris.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.345
And if they're in Paris, then
they will soon be in London.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.182
I've been out of circulation.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.039
Then you must go.

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.866
Yes. It is what I am.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.199
No, I shall not go.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.559
- No, you shall.
- No, no, no.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.386
- My mind is made up. I shall not go.
- No, you will.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.279
Sorry, ma'am.
I didn't see you there.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.999
It is quite all right, Mary.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.745
I will do it.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.279
Is there anything else, ma'am?

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.559
The guests will
be arriving shortly.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.545
That is everything.
Thank you, Mary.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.985
Mr. Tringham, I am sorry.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.986
Even when they are perfectly
developed at birth, it happens.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.787
I need a signature.

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.151
It is necessary.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.039
Will he have a burial?

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.342
Yes, of course.

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:19.183
Certificate of Death

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.785
Nelly, have you left
the keys on the table?

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.222
I believe an English family wish
to take the house for the winter.

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.187
Nelly?

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.870
Say something.

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.141
Say something!

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.791
We shall miss our train.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.959
All passengers arrived from France.
This train for London.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:53.959
I think we're in the
last compartment here.

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.079
It's Mr. Dickens.

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.639
Thank you. We're in here, I think.

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.759
Mr. Dickens, sir.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.519
My wife says she should marry
Rokesmith and be done.

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.199
- Perhaps the next chapter.
- I'll tell her.

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:03.990
That's for you.
Thank you very much.

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.985
Thank you.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:01.626
Sleep, Nelly, and when you
wake, we shall be home.

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:05.110
Gentlemen, please. Someone
open these carriages here.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:08.399
And your wife? Is anyone
else in this carriage?

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.479
Excuse me.

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:13.039
- Help!
- Over here!

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.159
- Please, they are hurt.
- Help!

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.679
Take the weight on your other leg.

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:18.141
Sir?

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.999
Sir?

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.519
We're asking everyone able-bodied

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.151
if they could help
with the most injured.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.987
We need all the hands we can get.

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.911
Nelly.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.461
Nelly.

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.546
Sir?

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.199
Excuse me, sir.

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:39.519
Could you come and assist me?

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.982
- Is it Mr. Dickens, sir?
- Yes.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.679
Were you traveling alone, sir?

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.141
Go.

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.599
Mr. Dickens.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:53.039
- Were you traveling alone?
- Go.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.639
Go. Go.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:55.959
Sir?

01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.199
Yes, quite alone.

01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:58.879
This woman is in need
of assistance.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.199
We are dealing
with the most injured first.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.319
Yes, I'll do what I can, but you
must attend to this young woman.

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.919
Madam, I will get one of
these ladies to attend to you.

01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.759
Ladies, please. This way, sir.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:08.519
- Yes, we're with her.
- Please, will you attend to her?

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.599
- We're with her.
- I have brandy here.

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:11.719
Uh...

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:13.359
- Sir?
- Don't worry. Stay here.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.479
Check who's inside.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:15.861
Ah.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:21.342
Sir, press down as hard as
you can to stop the blood flow.

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.119
Sir, this is brandy.

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.866
We will find assistance
for you as soon as possible.

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.719
Porter, we need to release
all passengers

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:35.919
from the train above so they
may help with the injured.

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:40.384
All able-bodied gentlemen,
bring their hats to this tree.

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.265
Ellen Ternan?

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.786
Yes.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.260
That was my name.

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.465
You have always known this?

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.105
Suspected.

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:57.159
Things you said.

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.621
Comments.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:03.547
Memories of Mr. Dickens that
were not a child's memories.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.984
I saw him read once.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.990
It was magical.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:19.426
One forgets that he was more
than writer, more than actor.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:26.187
I have lived my life in the
pages of those novels.

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.839
I should not have
expected their author

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:31.983
to have lived so quiet a life.

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.710
<i>The house is to your liking?</i>

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.666
Yes.

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:17.625
I'm happy to see the castle
from the window.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.399
There's a fire in every room.

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:22.399
And I've taken the liberty of employing
a nurse who will attend to you.

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.749
She's a local woman
but of good kind.

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.959
It's a sleepy market town
with a very fine butchers.

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:35.106
And the church is newly
restored, which you must visit.

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.639
The fast train from
Paddington takes 18 minutes.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:43.999
Or alternatively, there's a train to
Windsor from Victoria or Waterloo,

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.382
which also serves well.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.341
Nelly?

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.662
It's as if it's floating.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:13.262
You will come to see me?

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.879
Yes. Of course.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:17.199
Weekly?

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.119
Mmm, twice weekly. More.

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.799
And if I should need anything?

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:23.421
You need only ask.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.119
And should I expect you
at weekends and holidays?

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.186
- Yes, but my family...
- Of course.

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.386
When you can.

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:38.941
Yes.

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.630
And shall we keep Tringham?

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.621
Yes.

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:50.820
Then this is how it is to be now.

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:58.959
Whatever I have
tried to do in life,

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:01.866
I have tried with all
my heart to do it well.

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.359
Whatever I've
devoted myself to, I...

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:05.946
Don't, Charles.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.029
Don't explain.

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.823
There's nothing to say.

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:22.863
Everyone has their secret.

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.030
And this is ours.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.227
Yes.

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:01.064
<i>I was not a child
when I met Mr. Dickens-</i>

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.110
I was 18.

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:08.919
It wasn't easy, our friendship.

01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:14.226
Yet there were days of such
joy, such celebration.

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.624
And we'd talk and laugh together.

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:27.541
He knew he'd leave me first.

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.142
That he would die first.

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:41.308
Charles understood
that however painful it is,

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.265
we're alone.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:52.599
Whoever we're with,

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.425
we are alone.

01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.990
He was right.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:04.623
<i>Great Expectations.</i>

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:11.599
He wrote an ending. it was his
first instinctive ending.

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.106
A good ending.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.785
Pip and Estella do not
come together.

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:25.309
Pip sees that
she will never be his.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.839
Later they wanted him
to change it.

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.479
Some people thought it too brutal.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.350
So instead...

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.781
Pip's final words are...

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:49.145
"I saw the shadow of
no parting from her."

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:58.141
He ends the book in shadows.

01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:04.709
In uncertainty.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.344
In haunting.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.266
And that is where
I have been living.

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:23.345
Do you see?

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.146
Yes.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.668
I will not live there anymore.

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.599
Nelly.

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.079
You're late. It's nearly dark.

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.319
Where have you been?

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.860
George.

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:49.705
I am here.

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.870
I am here.

01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:59.199
Are you quite well?

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:01.119
Yes, George.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.070
Are you sure?

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:12.548
I walked with Mr. Benham today.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.399
We talked about Mr. Dickens.

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:17.906
Yes.

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.787
George...

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:28.546
The memories of a child, Nelly.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.230
Geoffrey.

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:37.944
Oh, Geoffrey.

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.559
You will frighten our guests.

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.319
I think he was trying
to frighten his mother.

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.746
Geoffrey.

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.260
- Go on, take your place.
- Yes, Mama.

01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.261
Nelly.

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.919
<i>Well, my lads,
the day has broken at last.</i>

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:35.745
<i>What do you say
to the weather now?</i>

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:38.359
I say the weather will do.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.599
I say doubtful.

01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:44.159
I can see for myself
there's a storm coming.

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:48.079
I smell the snow. I can feel
the hurricane in the air.

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:49.879
No money those gentlemen can offer

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:52.228
will tempt me to cross the
mountain with them today.

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.666
Well, are you ready at last

01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.919
to cross the mountain
with us or not?

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.879
I say yes, if the others
will say yes, too.

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.199
I say no!

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.519
I am mountain boy.

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:08.199
I know the pass up there
as I know my ABC.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:11.079
You know the mountain.
If you risk it, I will.

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.279
I'm your man. I will guide
you to your journey's end.

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:16.279
- Say when.
- Now!

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:17.599
Are you ready?

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.799
I am ready. Come along.

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:25.039
This is a tale of woe.

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.479
This is a tale of sorrow.

01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.959
A love denied, a love restored,

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.439
to live beyond tomorrow.

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:36.279
Lest we think silence is the
place to hide a heavy heart,

01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.679
remember, to love
and be loved is life itself

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:43.267
without which we are nought.
