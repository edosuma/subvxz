WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:06.113
I can't believe "Man Versus
Dumpster" has its own after-show.

00:06.196 --> 00:08.996
Oh, yeah. Talking trash is the best.

00:09.039 --> 00:11.105
How else would be know
how sick Dumpster Jack got

00:11.141 --> 00:12.440
from drinking that expired egg nog?

00:12.475 --> 00:15.043
Spoiler alert: Very.

00:17.013 --> 00:19.180
Dude, the least you can do is ask.

00:19.216 --> 00:21.216
Actually, he can't.

00:21.251 --> 00:23.318
We said the same word at the same time

00:23.353 --> 00:25.086
and I called "jinx,"

00:25.121 --> 00:28.156
so now he can't talk
until I say his name.

00:28.291 --> 00:29.424
What if he talks anyway?

00:29.459 --> 00:32.192
He has to wear my undies on his head.

00:32.228 --> 00:34.529
Classic game, classic punishment.

00:34.564 --> 00:37.231
And these are F-O-T-B...

00:37.267 --> 00:38.333
(sniffs)

00:38.368 --> 00:40.368
Fresh Off The Butt.

00:40.403 --> 00:43.371
Guys, get ready for
a blast from the past.

00:43.406 --> 00:46.574
Oh, no. More videos
of your old football games.

00:46.609 --> 00:49.243
That is not what this is.

00:49.279 --> 00:51.579
But if there's time we can watch my
incredible 62-yard touchdown pass...

00:51.614 --> 00:54.282
- Let's scatter!
- Wait! You're gonna like this.

00:54.317 --> 00:55.583
This is the commercial I made
for the Bait & Bite.

00:55.618 --> 00:57.418
I just bought a whole bunch of TV time

00:57.454 --> 00:59.153
so I can start running it again.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.355
I didn't know you made a commercial.

01:00.390 --> 01:02.090
Eleven years ago.

01:02.125 --> 01:03.191
But it holds up great.

01:07.130 --> 01:08.529
<i>Arrr, mateys!</i>

01:08.565 --> 01:11.199
<i>Come on down to the Bait & Bite</i>

01:11.234 --> 01:14.202
<i>for all yer sea-farin' needs.</i>

01:14.237 --> 01:15.503
<i>Even for the wee ones.</i>

01:15.916 --> 01:16.849
<i>Arr.</i>

01:16.874 --> 01:18.473
<i>(sniffing) Ooh!</i>

01:18.508 --> 01:21.542
<i>Harley, that does not smell like wee!</i>

01:21.578 --> 01:24.312
<i>Ohhh! Shiver me timbers!</i>

01:24.347 --> 01:26.547
<i>But you know what doesn't stink?</i>

01:26.583 --> 01:28.149
<i>Our deals!</i>

01:28.184 --> 01:30.518
<i>Ha ha! Arrr!</i>

01:30.553 --> 01:32.487
TOM: Adorable, right? Ooh, hang on guys.

01:32.522 --> 01:33.882
Your mom's gonna want to see this.

01:35.425 --> 01:38.426
Could that be more embarrassing?

01:38.461 --> 01:42.163
Yeah. Talk about amateur filmmaking.

01:42.198 --> 01:44.565
I mean, it had no look,
no point of view,

01:44.601 --> 01:47.535
the director didn't know rack
focus from a wardrobe rack,

01:47.570 --> 01:50.171
which, by the way,
you could see in the background.

01:50.206 --> 01:51.206
That's not what I meant.

01:51.241 --> 01:52.407
You pooped your pants.

01:52.442 --> 01:53.474
<i>That's</i> what I meant.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.176
Harley's "Doody" Diaz!

01:55.211 --> 01:57.378
Ha! You talked.

01:57.407 --> 01:58.722
I'm worth it.

01:58.747 --> 02:01.288
"Doody" Diaz. That name could stick.

02:01.317 --> 02:04.118
He's right. Once you get a nickname,

02:04.154 --> 02:05.386
it's hard to get rid of it.

02:05.422 --> 02:07.188
Ask "Booger" Bruce.

02:07.223 --> 02:09.323
He picked his nose once in second grade,

02:09.359 --> 02:10.390
and that's it.

02:10.426 --> 02:12.126
And truthfully,

02:12.162 --> 02:14.429
I think it was more
of an itch than a pick.

02:14.464 --> 02:16.130
This could be bad.

02:16.166 --> 02:18.366
MAN: <i>And now, your valedictorian,</i>

02:18.401 --> 02:20.168
<i>"Doody" Diaz.</i>

02:20.203 --> 02:21.536
If that commercial airs,

02:21.571 --> 02:25.139
it'll follow me around
for the rest of my life!

02:25.175 --> 02:27.308
Your name's Heinie Head.

02:27.343 --> 02:29.077
Better than "Doody" Diaz.

03:22.204 --> 03:24.672
<i>Arr! Arrr!</i>

03:24.792 --> 03:26.665
I look terrible in this commercial.

03:26.765 --> 03:29.103
But in my defense, not even Lady Gaga

03:29.139 --> 03:30.404
could pull off an eye patch
and a bandana.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.141
You're worried about how you look?

03:33.176 --> 03:34.542
I pooped my diaper!

03:34.577 --> 03:36.344
Harls, you were two.

03:36.379 --> 03:38.446
Yeah, but kids at school
are going to see this <i> now.</i>

03:38.481 --> 03:40.214
I think they know you poop.

03:40.250 --> 03:42.116
They don't need to <i> see</i> me poop.

03:42.152 --> 03:43.518
You can't run that commercial.

03:43.553 --> 03:45.386
I'll be humiliated.

03:45.421 --> 03:47.388
Wow, Harls, I didn't know
you'd feel this way.

03:47.423 --> 03:49.390
It's just with Rod's Reel
& Deal slashing prices,

03:49.425 --> 03:51.559
I've gotta do everything I can
to keep up.

03:51.594 --> 03:54.362
But if it means that much,
I won't run it.

03:54.397 --> 03:56.097
Thanks, Dad.

03:56.132 --> 03:57.298
I feel bad, though.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.167
You'll still get your money back, right?

03:59.202 --> 04:02.170
Oh, yeah, Rod's Reel & Deal
will snap that ad time right up.

04:02.205 --> 04:03.504
It's a prime fisherman slot.

04:03.540 --> 04:05.373
But they're slashing prices!

04:05.408 --> 04:07.508
I don't want you to lose
business because of me.

04:07.544 --> 04:11.212
Hey, what if you make
a whole new commercial?

04:11.247 --> 04:14.081
We've got a filmmaker
right here in the family. Ethan.

04:17.086 --> 04:18.386
Okay, you see those looks?

04:18.421 --> 04:20.120
Those are the looks of people

04:20.156 --> 04:21.488
who know Ethan doesn't finish stuff.

04:21.524 --> 04:23.191
Don't get me wrong.

04:23.226 --> 04:25.126
He starts off with lots of enthusiasm...

04:25.161 --> 04:26.394
Suit up!

04:26.429 --> 04:28.462
This is gonna be
the greatst sci-fi epic ever!

04:28.498 --> 04:31.465
<i>But the minute he hits a speed bump...</i>

04:31.501 --> 04:36.070
We are not wrapping the Martian
in wax paper, people.

04:36.105 --> 04:37.641
- I quit.
- <i>...that happens.</i>

04:37.666 --> 04:39.140
Can someone unfoil me?

04:39.175 --> 04:40.441
I'm pretty sure the part near my nose

04:40.476 --> 04:42.376
was wrapped around a tuna sandwich.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.378
Ethan's like me on laundry day...

04:44.414 --> 04:46.314
he starts strong,
but then ten minutes later

04:46.349 --> 04:48.082
he's hving tea and watching <i> Judge Judy.</i>

04:48.117 --> 04:50.084
I know he's given up in the past,

04:50.119 --> 04:51.352
but he can do this.

04:51.387 --> 04:54.388
I believe in him a hundred percent.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.257
Okay, you see this look?

04:56.292 --> 04:58.392
This is the look of somebody
who said a bunch of stuff

04:58.428 --> 05:00.194
she might not believe but is really,

05:00.230 --> 05:01.429
really hoping is true.

05:01.464 --> 05:04.365
Pay close attention...
you might see it again.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.400
The ad's supposed to run in two days.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.069
We don't have much time.

05:08.104 --> 05:09.237
I promise.

05:09.272 --> 05:10.471
If Ethan doesn't make
a better commercial,

05:10.506 --> 05:12.240
you can air the old one.

05:12.275 --> 05:14.242
No matter what,

05:14.277 --> 05:17.211
There will be an ad for the
Bait & Bite on TV this Friday.

05:17.247 --> 05:18.312
That would be great.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.315
There's that look again.

05:21.351 --> 05:24.085
Didn't think you'd
see it so soon, did you?

05:25.555 --> 05:28.155
I could really use some tea.

05:28.191 --> 05:31.459
Ooh! I wonder who Judge Judy
is yelling at today.

05:31.494 --> 05:35.329
Mom, I'd like you to meet
Coach Wood's service bird Leo.

05:35.365 --> 05:36.497
With all our team's losses,

05:36.532 --> 05:38.266
she needed the emotional support.

05:38.301 --> 05:40.101
That coach is a kook.

05:40.136 --> 05:41.168
- LEO: Coach is a kook.
- Mom!

05:41.204 --> 05:42.503
Watch what you say!

05:42.538 --> 05:44.272
Coach trusted me with him
while she's out of town.

05:44.307 --> 05:46.307
If she hears him saying stuff like this,

05:46.342 --> 05:47.541
she'll know where he learned it.

05:47.577 --> 05:50.094
- She'll think the Diazes are...
- Who we are?

05:50.119 --> 05:53.447
Exactly. I need her to think the
Diazes are kind, humble people.

05:53.483 --> 05:56.384
Got an A in history. Check it, losers.

05:56.419 --> 05:58.386
- LEO: Check it, losers!
- Leo, no!

05:58.421 --> 06:00.421
This family is a mine field.

06:00.456 --> 06:04.425
Great job, honey. I'm so proud of you.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.394
Yeah, it felt pretty good.

06:06.429 --> 06:08.129
but mostly because you promised me

06:08.164 --> 06:09.497
two tickets to Adele if I got an A.

06:09.532 --> 06:12.099
It's funny what a little
motivation'll do.

06:12.135 --> 06:15.069
Okay, putting "buy tickets"
on my to-do list.

06:15.104 --> 06:17.505
- Hello?
- Oh, I'm sure she'll sing that song.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.507
No, I mean, tickets go on sale tomorrow

06:19.542 --> 06:22.076
and Adele sells out in minutes.

06:22.111 --> 06:24.245
We'll need, like, six different
devices going at once.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.513
It sounds like a lot of work.

06:25.548 --> 06:27.381
I'll just call one of those
ticket broker places.

06:27.417 --> 06:29.116
We need to get them ourselves.

06:29.152 --> 06:31.218
Brokers add <i> huge</i> fees.

06:31.254 --> 06:33.154
We'll end up paying 500 per ticket

06:33.189 --> 06:34.522
to sit in the last row,

06:34.557 --> 06:37.191
and I did not learn
the chief imports of Belgium

06:37.226 --> 06:38.392
to sit in the last row.

06:38.428 --> 06:40.328
Five hundred per ticket?

06:40.363 --> 06:41.529
We have to buy them ourselves.

06:41.564 --> 06:43.364
Okay, we need every laptop,
phone, computer,

06:43.399 --> 06:45.399
everything ready to go
the second the sale starts.

06:45.435 --> 06:48.102
Funny what a little motivation will do.

06:52.475 --> 06:55.209
Just so you know,
you have those on wrong.

06:55.244 --> 06:58.112
This is because I lost that jinx.

06:58.147 --> 06:59.380
I want in.

06:59.415 --> 07:02.049
You really want a shot
at having those on your head?

07:02.085 --> 07:04.185
Won't matter, 'cause
I'm not going to lose.

07:04.220 --> 07:06.287
To be young and cocky again.

07:06.322 --> 07:08.422
This is not a game
for the faint of heart.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.458
Yeah, we're experts at jinx.

07:10.493 --> 07:13.127
Said the guy with undies on his head.

07:14.397 --> 07:17.031
We are taking her down.

07:19.502 --> 07:22.036
Sorry, it's really hard
to take you seriously

07:22.071 --> 07:24.038
when you're wearing an underwear hat.

07:25.541 --> 07:27.441
You know how you're always
dreaming about getting

07:27.477 --> 07:29.276
your big break as a filmmaker?

07:29.312 --> 07:31.112
Well, I just got it for you.

07:31.147 --> 07:32.513
You're going to shoot a
commercial for Dad's store.

07:32.548 --> 07:35.216
Awesome!

07:35.251 --> 07:37.151
This commercial
will put you in the bigs.

07:37.186 --> 07:38.452
It'll be on TV!

07:38.488 --> 07:41.055
Hey, maybe I can find a way
to finally pull off

07:41.090 --> 07:42.390
my signature camera move.

07:42.425 --> 07:44.225
All great directors have one.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.460
I've always wanted
to finish with a boom.

07:46.496 --> 07:50.264
Love the ambition, not sure Dad
wants us using explosives.

07:50.299 --> 07:51.532
No, a boom <i> shot.</i>

07:51.567 --> 07:53.467
That's when the camera lifts up

07:53.503 --> 07:55.202
and the frame goes wide

07:55.238 --> 07:57.104
and the story comes together.

07:57.140 --> 07:58.339
And that's when you know

07:58.374 --> 08:01.075
you've been movied by Ethan Diaz.

08:01.110 --> 08:03.043
I'm the queen of boom on a budget.

08:03.079 --> 08:05.146
I can totally make you
a rig for your camera.

08:05.181 --> 08:09.116
Wow. You really don't want to
be known as Doody Diaz, do you?

08:11.087 --> 08:13.187
Well, if I start my storyboard tonight,

08:13.222 --> 08:15.892
- I could have it done in three weeks.
- You have two days total.

08:15.998 --> 08:18.125
Storyboards are for wimps.

08:18.161 --> 08:20.127
It's all up here.

08:20.163 --> 08:21.395
Get ready.

08:21.431 --> 08:24.064
I'm about to direct the best no-budget,

08:24.100 --> 08:28.102
no-time, boom-tastic
bait shop commercial ever made!

08:28.137 --> 08:30.104
Yeah!

08:30.139 --> 08:32.506
Boom-tastic. Can't say
if I love it or hate it,

08:32.542 --> 08:34.207
but it's definitely not quitter talk.

08:39.549 --> 08:41.052
Oh, forget it.

08:45.972 --> 08:47.138
Hey hey,

08:47.174 --> 08:49.274
there's my lovely and talented star.

08:49.409 --> 08:53.077
Stop kissing up.
I already agreed to do it.

08:53.113 --> 08:55.213
A great director always
flatters the talent.

08:55.248 --> 08:58.082
That's a fun fact
I read on a movie screen.

08:58.118 --> 08:59.384
Anyway, you know your lines?

09:01.087 --> 09:05.089
The ocean is a cold and dangerous place,

09:05.125 --> 09:07.425
but I'm here to save you <i> money!</i>

09:07.461 --> 09:10.228
Wow, Daphne's a good little actress.

09:10.263 --> 09:13.164
She's gonna save us <i> money.</i>

09:13.200 --> 09:15.467
- See what I did there?
- Yeah.

09:15.502 --> 09:19.404
Was there any doubt that I was
gonna be the lead in this thing?

09:22.275 --> 09:25.009
Looks like you've got
everything you need.

09:25.045 --> 09:28.012
Including a total diva star.

09:28.048 --> 09:29.481
So I'm gonna be outside
building your camera rig.

09:29.516 --> 09:31.249
Oh, great.

09:31.284 --> 09:32.484
'Cause that boom shot

09:32.519 --> 09:35.353
is gonna take this ad to the next level.

09:35.388 --> 09:38.389
Any level where I'm not wearing
a diaper is fine by me.

09:38.425 --> 09:40.024
Oh, before I forget.

09:40.060 --> 09:41.125
For good luck.

09:41.161 --> 09:43.027
Since when do lobsters bring good luck?

09:43.063 --> 09:44.295
Are you kidding?

09:44.331 --> 09:46.498
They're the leprechauns of the sea.

09:46.533 --> 09:50.235
Not that you need any luck.
I totally trust you.

09:50.270 --> 09:53.338
To maybe possibly quit
if things get difficult.

09:53.373 --> 09:56.508
So I wired an old baby monitor
into this lobster shell.

09:56.543 --> 09:59.377
That way, I can listen in
and help smooth out any problems

09:59.412 --> 10:01.246
before it gets to quitting time.

10:01.281 --> 10:03.114
Sure, I know it's sneaky,

10:03.149 --> 10:06.050
but I'd rather be nicknamed
"Shady" than "Doody."

10:06.086 --> 10:08.319
Making movies is my thing.

10:08.355 --> 10:10.121
I <i> got</i> this.

10:10.156 --> 10:11.356
Totally.

10:11.391 --> 10:13.525
I'm just gonna leave this right here.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.394
Casually, not in any specific spot.

10:20.433 --> 10:22.500
So, what are we gonna be doing?

10:22.536 --> 10:27.305
Nothing. Every time I put you guys
in my movies it's a disaster.

10:27.340 --> 10:29.474
I'm only using you for the final
group shot of the whole family.

10:29.509 --> 10:32.176
You mean... we don't have any lines?

10:32.212 --> 10:33.311
Yeah.

10:33.346 --> 10:36.180
Cool! We can do high kicks!

10:36.216 --> 10:39.581
- Yeah! Yeah! High...
- Guys, stop, stop, stop, stop!

10:39.613 --> 10:42.752
- Stay out of my way and be quiet.
- Oh. Whatever.

10:42.882 --> 10:44.815
Good luck with your <i> kickless</i> ad.

10:46.426 --> 10:48.326
LEO: Check it, losers.

10:48.361 --> 10:50.562
Stop saying that. You misheard.

10:50.597 --> 10:52.397
No one here talks that way.

10:52.432 --> 10:54.332
Here's what we say...

10:54.367 --> 10:56.301
in the Diaz home.

10:56.336 --> 10:58.403
Okay.

10:58.438 --> 10:59.571
"Yes, please."

10:59.606 --> 11:01.372
"After you."

11:01.408 --> 11:04.309
"May I set the table, Mother?"

11:04.344 --> 11:07.211
Yeah, that's pushing it.
Coach'll never buy that.

11:07.247 --> 11:09.280
"Thank you. Don't mind if I do."

11:09.316 --> 11:10.481
Don't mind if I do.

11:10.517 --> 11:12.483
That's it! Should I read some more?

11:12.519 --> 11:14.185
May I set the table, Mother?

11:14.220 --> 11:16.387
Huh. I actually buy that
coming from you.

11:16.423 --> 11:18.089
Way to nail it.

11:18.124 --> 11:20.358
Okay. Just like we rehearsed.

11:20.393 --> 11:23.127
Ready? And... action!

11:27.300 --> 11:29.500
Cut. What's going on?

11:32.339 --> 11:34.196
O-Okay. You lost me at...

11:36.276 --> 11:39.110
Make yourself useful and get me a bagel.

11:39.145 --> 11:42.113
I'm the star. You guys
are just a couple of...

11:42.148 --> 11:43.281
ALL: Losers.

11:43.316 --> 11:44.515
Jinx!

11:44.551 --> 11:46.084
<i>Are you serious?</i>

11:46.119 --> 11:47.452
Unjinx her!

11:47.487 --> 11:49.420
I'd <i> love</i> to,

11:49.456 --> 11:52.123
but what was it that you said?

11:52.158 --> 11:54.258
I should be quiet?

11:54.294 --> 11:57.195
Fine, I'll do it myself.

11:57.230 --> 11:59.297
Daphne.

11:59.332 --> 12:01.099
What are you doing?

12:01.134 --> 12:04.068
It only works if the person
who called jinx says it.

12:04.104 --> 12:06.104
Were you never a kid?

12:06.139 --> 12:08.206
ETHAN (over monitor): <i>Guys,
I can't shoot this commercial</i>

12:08.241 --> 12:10.174
<i>if my lead can't speak.</i>

12:10.210 --> 12:11.210
<i>This is a problem.</i>

12:11.244 --> 12:13.411
Problem? I'm on it.

12:13.446 --> 12:15.446
How's the ad going?

12:15.482 --> 12:19.417
Great. And not just great like
people say it and don't mean it,

12:19.452 --> 12:21.285
- actual great.
- Nice,

12:21.321 --> 12:24.055
because I am so excited
about this commercial

12:24.090 --> 12:26.124
I bought more air time...
during <i> Judge Judy.</i>

12:26.159 --> 12:27.358
Your mother thinks I'm a god.

12:27.394 --> 12:28.426
It's gonna run a million times.

12:28.461 --> 12:30.194
Great.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.134
Wait. I'm confused.

12:36.169 --> 12:38.302
Who's jinxed again?

12:38.338 --> 12:40.138
Don't think we're falling for that one.

12:40.173 --> 12:42.140
Do you think we're dumb?

12:42.175 --> 12:43.541
Last week you sucked on a rock

12:43.576 --> 12:45.443
when I told you
it had a marshmallow center.

12:45.478 --> 12:49.080
It doesn't? I was still working on that.

12:50.350 --> 12:51.482
- (thud)
- HARLEY: Ow!

12:51.518 --> 12:52.550
What is this?

12:52.585 --> 12:55.186
Not candy. Don't bother.

12:55.221 --> 12:57.288
Wait, you finished
the camera rig already?

12:57.323 --> 12:59.290
Uh, it's pretty close.

12:59.325 --> 13:02.293
So I heard somebody was jinxed.
Who was it again?

13:02.328 --> 13:05.329
We're not saying our name.
You guys are pathetic.

13:05.365 --> 13:08.199
How did you know that Daphne was jinxed?

13:10.370 --> 13:12.715
- You said so.
- No I didn't.

13:12.740 --> 13:15.440
Do you want to sit here
and argue, or make an ad?

13:15.475 --> 13:17.442
Well, I'm kinda stuck.

13:17.477 --> 13:22.046
I mean, my star can't speak. I <i> need</i> her.

13:22.082 --> 13:24.315
(mouthing words)

13:24.350 --> 13:27.218
Okay, okay, you don't need to yell.

13:27.253 --> 13:30.221
You know, this ad's
getting to be a real bummer.

13:30.256 --> 13:33.057
Idea. Jump ahead
to Mom and Rachel's part

13:33.093 --> 13:34.292
and shoot Daphne later.

13:34.327 --> 13:36.160
I'll let you know when she's unjinxed.

13:36.196 --> 13:37.395
That should work.

13:37.430 --> 13:39.330
Man, show business is tough.

13:39.365 --> 13:42.233
I wonder how Spielberg
gets his actors unjinxed?

13:46.172 --> 13:48.539
Okay, all of these are logged
into the ticket website

13:48.575 --> 13:51.175
and we have 21 minutes
before they go on sale.

13:51.211 --> 13:53.447
- Let's practice speed refreshing.
- Okay.

13:58.485 --> 14:00.451
(phone chimes)

14:00.487 --> 14:02.353
Hey, Ethan.

14:02.388 --> 14:04.489
Us? Now?

14:04.524 --> 14:07.191
Why?

14:07.227 --> 14:09.494
Well, to be fair, that's how jinx works.

14:09.529 --> 14:12.130
Okay, fine.

14:12.165 --> 14:14.465
Pack it up. We're moving this
operation down to the store.

14:14.501 --> 14:17.068
What? But you promised we'd get tickets!

14:17.103 --> 14:19.070
And I promised your brother
I'd do his commercial.

14:19.105 --> 14:20.471
I guess I'll do what I do every day:

14:20.507 --> 14:23.141
spread myself too thin
and disappoint <i> all</i> my kids.

14:23.176 --> 14:24.208
Let's go.

14:26.112 --> 14:28.312
You can tie him up and shave his head...

14:28.348 --> 14:30.381
he's not gonna say your name.

14:30.416 --> 14:32.250
Don't give her any ideas!

14:32.285 --> 14:33.484
Whatever you do,

14:33.520 --> 14:36.154
do it quietly.

14:38.124 --> 14:41.459
Guys, come on, you're supposed
to be selling kayaks here.

14:41.494 --> 14:44.262
- I have no bars!
- I'm not getting through!

14:44.297 --> 14:46.197
Ow! Thumb cramp.

14:46.232 --> 14:48.432
You gave birth to seven kids.
Work through the pain.

14:48.468 --> 14:52.370
Look, if this were an ad for an
eletronics store commercial...

14:52.405 --> 14:55.715
Two more minutes, Ethan! Do you know
how much those ticket brokers charge?

14:58.378 --> 15:00.144
When are you shooting our scene?

15:00.180 --> 15:02.180
Uh...

15:02.215 --> 15:04.015
how does now work for you?

15:04.050 --> 15:05.249
Just lose the bird.

15:05.285 --> 15:06.350
I can't leave him alone.

15:06.386 --> 15:08.319
Leo has separation anxiety.

15:08.354 --> 15:10.488
Which is weird, because
as an emotional support bird

15:10.523 --> 15:12.156
it's also something he treats.

15:12.192 --> 15:14.125
Okay.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.294
Then you say, "Ahoy, mateys,

15:16.329 --> 15:18.029
big savings ahead."

15:18.064 --> 15:20.064
Can I say, "Shiver me timbers" instead?

15:20.099 --> 15:22.099
- That was my big line last time.
- Sure!

15:22.135 --> 15:24.168
Actors... (scoffs)

15:24.204 --> 15:26.103
Okay, I'm gonna call "action,"

15:26.139 --> 15:28.206
then just keep going till I say "cut."

15:28.241 --> 15:31.309
- LEO: Action!
- Tiver me shimbers... Ahh...

15:31.344 --> 15:33.044
I didn't call "action."

15:33.079 --> 15:35.279
That was the bird.
Do I sound like a bird?

15:35.315 --> 15:37.035
I'm not sure. Say "action"
again and I'll...

15:37.068 --> 15:38.449
I don't sound like a bird.

15:38.484 --> 15:40.318
Okay, here we go.

15:40.353 --> 15:41.519
(parrot-like) Action!

15:41.554 --> 15:45.122
Shiver me timbers. Big savings ahead.

15:45.158 --> 15:48.292
Arrr! When you be in need of
fishing and boating supplies...

15:48.328 --> 15:49.328
LEO: Cut!

15:49.362 --> 15:51.062
What? Not feeling the pirate?

15:51.097 --> 15:53.197
- That was Leo!
- Wow!

15:53.233 --> 15:56.067
Actually, yes, you <i> do</i> sound like a bird!

15:56.102 --> 15:58.069
Okay, I can't work with Leo.

15:58.104 --> 15:59.303
ETHAN: <i> He's driving me crazy.</i>

16:05.245 --> 16:07.345
You can't unjinx here.
Why are you tied up?

16:07.380 --> 16:09.413
I asked. It looked fun.

16:09.449 --> 16:13.217
This is <i> not</i> worth it.

16:13.253 --> 16:16.187
MAN (over P.A.): <i>Please welcome the
President of the United States,</i>

16:16.222 --> 16:18.189
<i>"Doody" Diaz!</i>

16:18.224 --> 16:19.423
Then again...

16:19.459 --> 16:21.025
ETHAN: <i>Can someone find Harley?</i>

16:21.060 --> 16:22.226
<i>I'm ready for the rig.</i>

16:22.262 --> 16:26.430
Okay, rig, time to erease
"Doody" Diaz for good.

16:26.466 --> 16:28.503
Doody Diaz, Doody Diaz.

16:28.770 --> 16:32.103
Emotional support bird?
<i>So</i> not supportive.

16:34.531 --> 16:36.465
That looks amazing.

16:36.500 --> 16:39.167
It could have used more time,

16:39.203 --> 16:40.502
but I was busy listening to the lobster.

16:40.537 --> 16:42.170
What?

16:42.206 --> 16:44.473
It's, uh, movie set talk.

16:44.508 --> 16:47.242
You know, "Lights, camera, lobster!"

16:47.277 --> 16:48.517
Surprised you haven't heard it.

16:48.545 --> 16:51.146
Anyway, this should
get you your boom shot.

16:51.181 --> 16:53.515
Great, because so far I've got nothing.

16:53.550 --> 16:56.618
But my signature shot
could save this whole ad.

16:56.653 --> 16:59.187
I'm gonna start close on the family

16:59.223 --> 17:01.356
and then boom up
to show off the entire store

17:01.392 --> 17:04.393
as upbeat and cheery
as the Diaz family itself.

17:04.428 --> 17:07.429
(sighs) We didn't get Adele tickets.

17:07.464 --> 17:09.364
It's gonna cost a bazillion dollars

17:09.400 --> 17:11.199
to buy them from a broker.

17:11.234 --> 17:13.468
And I have to sit in the last row.

17:13.503 --> 17:16.271
I don't even know how to shop
for last row outfits.

17:16.306 --> 17:18.140
Maybe don't start with them.

17:18.175 --> 17:19.441
Come on, guys, let's get into place

17:19.476 --> 17:20.575
for the big group shot.

17:20.611 --> 17:23.178
It's lobster time.

17:29.153 --> 17:30.285
Action.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.487
So come on down to the Bait & Bite,

17:32.523 --> 17:34.256
the family store that has...

17:34.291 --> 17:35.590
(phone chimes)

17:35.626 --> 17:37.766
Adele just announced a second concert!

17:37.791 --> 17:39.327
- Yes!
- (Leo squawks)

17:39.363 --> 17:40.462
Leo!

17:40.497 --> 17:43.262
- LEO: Doody Diaz! Doody Diaz!
- I am now.

17:43.287 --> 17:44.680
- Who taught him that?
- Cut.

17:50.441 --> 17:52.607
I can't do this anymore.

17:52.643 --> 17:55.653
This commercial is doomed. I quit.

17:57.214 --> 17:58.613
Dang, that was close!

17:58.649 --> 18:00.449
Ha! You talked!

18:00.484 --> 18:02.250
What would you prefer,

18:02.286 --> 18:04.553
butt in front, or butt in back?

18:09.159 --> 18:10.525
I can't believe you're quitting.

18:10.561 --> 18:13.328
After I spent the whole day
solving <i> your</i> problems.

18:13.363 --> 18:16.164
- What?
- That lobster I gave you...

18:17.468 --> 18:19.334
it had a monitor in it
so I could help you.

18:19.369 --> 18:21.369
I knew lobsters weren't lucky!

18:21.405 --> 18:23.271
They end up dropped in boiling water.

18:27.144 --> 18:29.211
So I guess you don't
think I'm good at directing.

18:29.246 --> 18:31.213
I <i> know</i> you're good at directing.

18:31.248 --> 18:33.148
But you're also good at quitting.

18:33.183 --> 18:35.150
Success takes more than talent,

18:35.185 --> 18:36.451
it takes dedication.

18:36.487 --> 18:38.186
I should know.

18:38.222 --> 18:41.590
I'm an inventor,
half the things I try, fail.

18:41.625 --> 18:44.226
And whether or not you do this ad,

18:44.261 --> 18:46.461
I'm gonna make that rig work, too.

18:46.497 --> 18:48.597
Because I don't quit
when things go wrong.

18:48.632 --> 18:50.298
I'm sorry I let you down.

18:50.334 --> 18:52.567
You didn't just let me down...

18:52.603 --> 18:55.237
you let <i> you</i> down.

18:55.272 --> 18:59.174
♪ I got the tickets, I got the tickets ♪

18:59.209 --> 19:00.509
(laughing)

19:00.544 --> 19:02.377
I know there's something going on here,

19:02.412 --> 19:04.246
but I can't stop dancing.

19:04.281 --> 19:06.181
(laughing)

19:08.585 --> 19:10.418
You didn't get the tickets either?

19:10.454 --> 19:13.455
No, I only got...

19:13.490 --> 19:15.123
fifth row!

19:15.159 --> 19:17.425
What? That's amazing!

19:17.461 --> 19:19.294
You're going to see Adele

19:19.329 --> 19:21.196
and we can all afford
to go to the dentist this year.

19:21.231 --> 19:24.199
And I know who I'm gonna take
with the extra ticket.

19:24.234 --> 19:26.535
- You.
- Really?

19:26.570 --> 19:28.470
Oh, Rach...

19:28.505 --> 19:30.305
thank you so much.

19:31.608 --> 19:33.375
No thanks needed.

19:33.410 --> 19:37.112
A poster, a T-shirt and a hoodie needed.

19:37.147 --> 19:39.314
I want you to know
I'll honor my promise.

19:39.349 --> 19:41.216
You can air the old commercial tomorrow.

19:41.251 --> 19:43.285
I have accepted my fate.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.520
MALE VOICEOVER: <i>And the very
first footprints on Mars</i>

19:45.556 --> 19:48.290
<i>belong to Commander Doody Diaz.</i>

19:48.325 --> 19:49.591
<i>(laughter)</i>

19:49.626 --> 19:52.360
Those Martians were laughing at me!

19:52.396 --> 19:53.562
ETHAN: Everyone, get in here!

19:53.597 --> 19:54.757
I have something to show you.

19:58.302 --> 19:59.568
I finished my commercial.

19:59.603 --> 20:02.237
Now, I didn't have a lot to work with,

20:02.272 --> 20:05.173
but someone told me to never give up.

20:05.209 --> 20:07.209
So I took what I had into editing

20:07.244 --> 20:09.544
and added a few things.

20:09.580 --> 20:14.149
<i>ETHAN: The Bait & Bite has all
your outdoor needs covered,</i>

20:14.184 --> 20:15.584
<i>so you're ready for anything.</i>

20:15.619 --> 20:18.153
<i>That's right, anything.</i>

20:18.188 --> 20:22.671
- (all cheer)
- <i>Instead of sitting around being bored...</i>

20:23.427 --> 20:27.329
<i>grab a board and surf on down
to the Bait & Bite.</i>

20:27.364 --> 20:31.366
<i>We've got everything you need
for outdoor fun.</i>

20:31.401 --> 20:34.202
<i>Don't get lost at sea
looking for good deals...</i>

20:34.238 --> 20:36.204
Yes!

20:36.240 --> 20:39.174
<i>...it's a whale of a sale,
so come on down.</i>

20:39.209 --> 20:41.509
<i>And bring your family to meet ours.</i>

20:41.545 --> 20:44.446
<i>Open seven days a week,
se hable espanol.</i>

20:44.481 --> 20:46.248
<i>Well, some of us.</i>

20:46.283 --> 20:48.550
(all cheering)

20:48.585 --> 20:50.452
I love it. We gotta celebrate.

20:50.487 --> 20:52.220
Everybody into the kitchen.

20:52.256 --> 20:54.422
Pizza rolls on me.

20:54.458 --> 20:56.391
I finished those yesterday.

20:56.426 --> 20:57.626
Taquitos on me.

20:57.661 --> 20:59.527
I ate those last night.

20:59.563 --> 21:01.296
Did anybody eat the fruit cups?

21:03.166 --> 21:04.599
Fruit cups on me!

21:04.635 --> 21:07.369
- Yeah!
- Yes.

21:07.404 --> 21:09.137
- Good job.
- Great job.

21:10.207 --> 21:12.207
You totally bailed me out.

21:12.242 --> 21:13.308
Just so you know,

21:13.343 --> 21:15.210
I might still quit on other stuff,

21:15.245 --> 21:17.412
but I'll never quit on my BFTF.

21:17.447 --> 21:19.314
You better not.

21:20.617 --> 21:22.617
I'll never quit! I'll never quit!

21:22.653 --> 21:24.386
I just got a text from Coach.

21:24.421 --> 21:26.454
She'll be here any minute
to pick up Leo.

21:26.490 --> 21:28.623
Good thing I finally got him
to clean up his beak.

21:28.659 --> 21:30.158
I'll never quit.

21:30.193 --> 21:31.459
Wow, look what he learned here.

21:31.495 --> 21:33.461
Hey, wins all around.

21:33.497 --> 21:35.530
Georgie, hit me with a fruit cup.

21:35.565 --> 21:39.301
- Georgie hit me. Georgie hit me.
- Leo. No no. No no no. Shh!

21:39.336 --> 21:41.937
- Georgie hit me.
- Tell Coach Woods I moved.
