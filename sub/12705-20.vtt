WEBVTT

00:15.282 --> 00:17.585
Hmm.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.524
What? Do I have funny
bed hair or something?

00:24.557 --> 00:27.228
Or something.
Hmm.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.198
I guess we got a
little carried away

00:30.231 --> 00:34.201
with the whole
post-slayage nap thing?

00:34.234 --> 00:36.070
Hmm.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.704
Oh, not good.

00:37.737 --> 00:39.539
(both laughing)

00:39.573 --> 00:42.042
Where you going?
To go kill a
cat on my head.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.011
No mirrors.

00:44.043 --> 00:45.512
Oh.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.747
You know, this place
really isn't girl-friendly.

00:47.780 --> 00:50.049
No mirrors, no
natural light.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.719
I think you look perfect.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.354
Oh, yeah, I really look... okay.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.557
Mmm. Mmm.

00:58.591 --> 01:03.030
Maybe we should think
about getting a few mirrors.

01:03.063 --> 01:07.567
And maybe a drawer, you know,
for some of my stuff.
Mm.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.703
Because that's
what couples do.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.371
They have drawers.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.906
Hmm. That's right. Mm-hmm.

01:13.941 --> 01:16.075
You know, I-I
figure, that way,

01:16.109 --> 01:19.079
sometimes I could
spend the night.

01:19.112 --> 01:20.980
Like, after the prom,

01:21.013 --> 01:23.551
it would be nice to
be able to just...

01:23.584 --> 01:26.486
come back here and spend
some time together.

01:26.519 --> 01:29.890
The prom?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.293
End of high school,
rite of passage thingy.

01:32.325 --> 01:35.061
Think cotillion with spiked
punch and the electric slide.

01:35.094 --> 01:36.996
Right.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.133
Don't worry.
It's at night.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.569
And lots of girls
have older boyfriends.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.704
You'll blend.
(chuckles)

01:46.006 --> 01:48.509
I think maybe you should
get going, huh?

01:48.542 --> 01:52.111
Oh. There must be a few
more hours before sunrise.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.650
Aah! Aah!

01:56.683 --> 01:58.852
Oh! Sorry.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.188
I guess it's later
than we thought.

02:06.859 --> 02:09.997
(wolf howling)

02:10.030 --> 02:12.199
*

03:01.514 --> 03:03.317
(indistinct, overlapping
crowd chatter)

03:03.350 --> 03:05.051
Xander.

03:05.085 --> 03:09.021
Well, hey, it's demon Anya,
punisher of evil males.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.091
Still haven't got
your powers back?

03:11.123 --> 03:14.026
You haven't, right?
No.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.062
I will, though.
It's just a matter of time.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.064
So, now, how
did that work?

03:18.098 --> 03:21.033
Women would wish horrible
things on their ex-boyfriends.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.437
You'd show up and
make it happen.
That's right.

03:23.471 --> 03:26.539
The power of the wish
made me a righteous sword

03:26.574 --> 03:28.341
to smite the unfaithful.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.777
Well, hey, good luck with that.
Hope it works out for you.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.913
You know, you can laugh,
but I have witnessed

03:32.945 --> 03:34.682
a millennium of treachery
and oppression

03:34.715 --> 03:36.115
from the males
of the species,

03:36.149 --> 03:37.550
and I have nothing
but contempt

03:37.585 --> 03:39.118
for the whole libidinous
lot of them.

03:39.151 --> 03:40.954
Then why are you talking to me?

03:40.987 --> 03:43.557
(sighs)

03:43.591 --> 03:45.759
I don't have a date
for the prom.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.929
Well, gosh, I wonder why not.

03:48.961 --> 03:50.463
It couldn't possibly
have anything

03:50.497 --> 03:51.799
to do with your sales pitch.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.866
Men are evil.
Will you go with me?

03:53.901 --> 03:58.038
One of us is very confused,
and I honestly don't know which.

03:58.070 --> 04:00.139
You know, this happens
to be all your fault.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.609
My fault?

04:01.641 --> 04:02.943
You were unfaithful
to Cordelia,

04:02.975 --> 04:04.711
so I took on the guise
of a 12th grader

04:04.745 --> 04:06.580
to tempt her with the wish.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.981
When I lost my powers,
I got stuck in this persona,

04:09.015 --> 04:10.418
and now I have
all these "feelings."

04:10.450 --> 04:12.586
I don't understand it.
I don't like it.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.587
All I know is I really want
to go to this dance,

04:14.622 --> 04:16.088
and I want someone
to go with me.

04:16.122 --> 04:18.391
Be still, my heart.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.661
Oh, wait, it is. How come
I got the short straw?

04:21.694 --> 04:23.129
Y-You're not
quite as obnoxious

04:23.163 --> 04:24.997
as most of
the alpha males around here.

04:25.031 --> 04:26.899
Plus, I know
you don't have a date.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.136
I haven't settled
on anyone yet.

04:29.168 --> 04:31.605
Fine. Look, I know
you find me attractive.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.240
I've seen you looking
at my breasts.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.442
Nothing personal, but
when a guy does that,

04:35.475 --> 04:37.511
it just means his
eyes are open.

04:37.545 --> 04:41.382
Whatever. Look, do you want
to go with me or not?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.319
Anya, huh?
Interesting choice.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.822
Choice is kind of a broad term
for my situation.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.923
See, it's either Anya,

04:50.957 --> 04:54.261
or the sock puppet of love
for this boy.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.262
(in high-pitched voice):
I love you, Xander.

04:56.295 --> 04:58.197
I'll never leave you.

04:58.230 --> 05:00.033
WILLOW:
Well, if Anya tries

05:00.067 --> 05:02.470
to get you killed, put me down
for a big "I told you so."

05:02.502 --> 05:05.973
Who's this Anya?
Is she prettier than me?

05:06.005 --> 05:09.509
She just better not try to cross
me, that's all I'm saying.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.812
Well, at least we all have
someone to go with now.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.312
And some of us are
going with demons,

05:13.346 --> 05:15.382
but I think that's a
valid lifestyle choice.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.718
More importantly,
I have the kick dress.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.120
Ooh, the pink one?

05:20.153 --> 05:21.622
Angel's gonna lose it,

05:21.654 --> 05:23.891
but not his soul.

05:23.923 --> 05:27.394
I mean, he's gonna
lose it. His it.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.906
(knocking)

05:51.050 --> 05:52.586
Ms. Summers.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.555
I'm sorry to, uh...

05:54.588 --> 05:57.024
Well, I-I would have called,
but I don't have your number.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.026
Please. You're
always welcome.

06:00.427 --> 06:04.031
My goodness.
Your place is amazing.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.899
Yeah. I like
a lot of space.

06:05.932 --> 06:08.636
I don't get out much
in the day.
No, you wouldn't.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.040
Can I get you something?
I don't have any coffee.

06:14.074 --> 06:17.043
You know...
Oh, no, thank you. I...

06:17.076 --> 06:19.747
You don't drink?
Beverages, I mean.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.714
No, I do. It's, uh...

06:21.749 --> 06:23.850
It's just the caffeine.
It makes me jittery.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.386
Oh.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.088
I understand
Buffy spent the night.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.290
I'm sorry about that.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.759
We came back
after patrolling...

06:32.793 --> 06:34.595
I'm... I'm not interested
in the details.

06:34.627 --> 06:36.096
That's not why I'm here.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.298
Okay.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.735
I'm here because I'm worried
about you two. In general.

06:41.769 --> 06:46.105
What happened before, when I
changed, it won't happen again.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.242
That's not all
I'm concerned about.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.644
I don't have to tell you

06:50.677 --> 06:52.480
that you and Buffy are
from different worlds.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.281
No, you don't.

06:55.314 --> 06:59.218
She's had to deal with
a lot, grow up fast.

06:59.252 --> 07:03.557
Sometimes even I forget
that she's still just a girl.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.059
I'm old enough
to be her ancestor.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.062
She's just starting
out in life.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.031
I know.

07:12.699 --> 07:16.036
I think about it more now that
she's staying in Sunnydale.

07:17.269 --> 07:18.805
Good.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.973
Because when it comes
to you, Angel,

07:21.007 --> 07:24.144
she's just like any other
young woman in love.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.747
You're all she can
see of tomorrow,

07:26.779 --> 07:28.447
but I think we both know

07:28.481 --> 07:30.584
that there are some
hard choices ahead.

07:30.617 --> 07:34.221
If she can't make them,
you're gonna have to.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.793
I know you care about her.

07:39.826 --> 07:41.894
I just hope
you care enough.

07:43.663 --> 07:44.997
So it was blue
and sort of short?

07:45.031 --> 07:47.500
Not too short. Medium.

07:47.534 --> 07:51.338
And it had this weird sort of,
uh, fringy stuff on its arms.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.206
What's that, a demon?
BUFFY:
A prom dress

07:53.240 --> 07:55.375
that Will was
thinking of getting.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.144
Can't you ever get your mind
out of the Hellmouth?

07:57.177 --> 07:59.112
I'd be delighted to.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.649
However, the day of the Mayor's
ascension is fast approaching,

08:01.682 --> 08:03.449
and we don't know
what to expect.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.817
Well, what about the pages Will
stole from the Mayor's book?

08:04.851 --> 08:07.120
Look, she put her life
on the line there, pal.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.622
Don't tell me they're useless.
On the contrary, no.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.189
We-we, um, we know

08:10.223 --> 08:11.692
that the ascension refers to

08:11.725 --> 08:14.194
a human transforming
into a demon,

08:14.226 --> 08:15.829
becoming the living
embodiment of an immortal,

08:15.862 --> 08:17.396
and graduation day,

08:17.430 --> 08:19.165
our Mayor Wilkins
is scheduled to do just that.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.634
WESLEY:
The trouble is,
we don't know which demon

08:20.668 --> 08:23.202
he's going to become.

08:23.235 --> 08:24.637
There are thousands
of-of species.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.872
So it's safe to say

08:25.906 --> 08:27.675
we shouldn't waste any time

08:27.707 --> 08:29.643
on such trifling matters
as a school dance.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.644
CORDELIA:
Well, that's too bad,
because I bet you would look

08:31.678 --> 08:33.681
way 007 in a tux.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.384
Except, of course,
on the actual night,

08:38.418 --> 08:41.321
when I will be aiding Mr. Giles
in his chaperoning duties.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.755
What?

08:42.789 --> 08:44.892
Excuse me?

08:44.924 --> 08:46.659
Fine, fine, fine.
We'll get you a dress.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.995
You know, we should
check April Fools.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.229
Don't go there.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.565
I shop there.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.000
XANDER:
I, myself,

08:53.033 --> 08:54.067
am dipping into
my hard-earned

08:54.100 --> 08:55.201
road trip fund

08:55.235 --> 08:56.836
to procure a shiny
new tux,

08:56.870 --> 08:58.205
so look for me to dazzle.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.373
And I shall be wearing
pink taffeta,

09:00.407 --> 09:02.676
as chenille will not
go with my complexion.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.778
Can we please talk
about the ascension?

09:04.812 --> 09:07.715
Giles, we get it.
Miles to go before we sleep.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.381
But especially if we're
all going to vaporize

09:09.416 --> 09:10.783
or something on
graduation day,

09:10.817 --> 09:12.785
we deserve
a little promy fun.

09:12.820 --> 09:13.953
One night of glory,

09:13.986 --> 09:16.056
not too much to ask.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.557
*

09:29.336 --> 09:31.838
(snarling)

09:41.313 --> 09:43.750
PRIEST:
 Into this holy estate,

09:43.783 --> 09:45.585
these two persons present

09:45.619 --> 09:47.955
now come to be joined.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.956
If any man can show just cause

09:49.990 --> 09:52.591
why they should not
be lawfully joined together,

09:52.625 --> 09:54.260
let him speak now,

09:54.293 --> 09:56.929
or else here and after
hold his peace.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.732
Bless, O Lord, this ring,

09:59.767 --> 10:02.669
that he who gives it
and she who wears it

10:02.702 --> 10:04.504
shall abide in thy peace

10:04.537 --> 10:06.072
and continue in thy favor,

10:06.105 --> 10:08.075
through Christ our Lord...

10:08.107 --> 10:10.342
*

10:39.972 --> 10:42.042
*

11:08.000 --> 11:09.903
Angel?

11:22.249 --> 11:24.250
(gasping)

11:30.623 --> 11:33.426
(water dripping)

11:35.895 --> 11:37.529
I always say
patrol's not complete

11:37.563 --> 11:39.331
without a trip
to the stinky sewers.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.400
I'm sure I saw him
come down here.

11:41.433 --> 11:44.037
Couldn't we just let this
be the vamp that got away?

11:44.071 --> 11:45.838
We could say
he was this big.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.774
What can I say? I need closure.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.375
You need clothes.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.211
You don't have
a tux, do you?

11:51.244 --> 11:54.181
Since when did patrolling
go black tie?

11:54.213 --> 11:56.448
For the prom, silly.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.018
We have more important things

11:58.051 --> 12:00.419
to think about right now
than a dance, Buffy.

12:00.452 --> 12:01.955
Sorry, Giles.
I'll just be quiet.

12:03.155 --> 12:04.390
Come on.

12:04.423 --> 12:05.958
Don't be that way.

12:06.927 --> 12:07.827
Not now.

12:09.461 --> 12:11.697
I'm not being that way.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.732
Every time I say the word
"prom," you get grouchy.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.802
I'm sorry.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.570
I'm just worried that
you're getting too...

12:17.604 --> 12:18.971
invested in this whole thing.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.740
What whole thing?

12:20.774 --> 12:22.208
Isn't this the stuff

12:22.241 --> 12:23.710
that I'm supposed
to get invested in?

12:23.743 --> 12:26.546
Going to a formal,
graduating, growing up?

12:26.578 --> 12:29.015
I know. I...

12:31.750 --> 12:34.354
Then what?
What's with the dire?

12:40.326 --> 12:42.495
It's, uh...

12:42.528 --> 12:43.763
It's nothing.

12:43.797 --> 12:46.332
No, you have "something" face.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.269
I think we need to talk.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.841
But not now, not here.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.475
No.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.610
No, if you have
something to say, then say it.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.249
Angel, drop the cryptic.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.515
You're scaring me.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.288
I've been thinking...
about our future.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.759
And the more I do,
the more I feel like us,

13:13.793 --> 13:17.096
you and me
being together,

13:17.129 --> 13:19.532
is unfair to you.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.269
Is this about
what the Mayor said?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.104
Because he was just
trying to shake us up.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.804
He was right.

13:25.838 --> 13:28.341
No. No, he wasn't.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.909
He's the bad guy.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.350
(sighs deeply)

13:38.384 --> 13:41.153
You deserve more.

13:41.187 --> 13:45.392
You deserve something outside
of demons and darkness.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.062
I mean...

13:49.096 --> 13:52.331
you should be with someone
who can take you into the light.

13:54.366 --> 13:56.235
Someone who can
make love to you.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.071
I don't care about that.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.506
You will. A-And children...

14:00.539 --> 14:02.875
Children?
Can you say "jumping the gun"?

14:02.909 --> 14:04.244
I kill my goldfish.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.711
Today.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.647
But you have no idea
how fast it goes, Buffy.

14:07.679 --> 14:09.481
Before you know it,
you'll want it all.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.884
A normal life...

14:10.918 --> 14:12.719
I'll never have a normal life.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.053
Right.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.754
You'll always
be a slayer,

14:15.788 --> 14:17.224
but that's all the more reason

14:17.256 --> 14:18.658
why you should have
a real relationship...

14:18.691 --> 14:20.726
instead of this...
this freak show.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.198
I didn't mean that.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.735
I'm gonna go.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.903
I'm sorry.

14:30.937 --> 14:32.871
All right, Buffy?

14:32.905 --> 14:35.042
You know how much
I love you.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.842
It kills me
to say this.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.411
Then don't.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.712
Who are you to tell me
what's right for me?

14:40.746 --> 14:43.115
You think I haven't
thought about this?
Have you?

14:43.149 --> 14:45.552
Rationally?
No.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.787
No, of course not.
I'm just some swoony
little schoolgirl, right?

14:47.820 --> 14:50.789
I'm trying to do
what's right here, okay?

14:50.822 --> 14:53.059
I'm trying to think with my head
instead of my heart.

14:53.092 --> 14:54.860
Heart?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.296
You have a heart?

14:56.328 --> 14:58.597
It isn't even beating.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.768
Don't.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.071
Don't what?
Don't love you?

15:04.104 --> 15:05.605
I'm sorry. You know what?

15:05.638 --> 15:08.375
I didn't know that
I got a choice in that.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.342
I'm never gonna change.
I can't change.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.283
I want my life to be with you.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.355
(whispering):
I don't.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.159
You don't want to be with me?

15:33.799 --> 15:36.269
I can't believe
you're breaking up with me.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.008
Look, it doesn't mean
that I don't...

15:52.219 --> 15:55.288
How am I supposed
to stay away from you?

15:56.889 --> 15:59.525
I'm leaving.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.197
After the ascension.

16:04.230 --> 16:09.135
After it's finished
with the Mayor and Faith...

16:09.168 --> 16:11.671
if we survive, I'll go.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.643
Where?

16:16.676 --> 16:19.379
I don't know.

16:28.721 --> 16:32.024
Is this really happening?

16:44.736 --> 16:46.773
*

17:14.701 --> 17:17.036
So, that's it?

17:18.105 --> 17:19.570
That's it.

17:19.605 --> 17:22.509
Assuming we survive
this ascension thing,

17:22.540 --> 17:24.411
he's gonna leave town.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.615
Well, he's a fool.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.583
He's just a...

17:30.616 --> 17:33.286
big, dumb, jerk person,
if you ask me.

17:33.319 --> 17:36.256
And he's
a-a super-maxi jerk

17:36.288 --> 17:37.789
for doing it right
before the prom.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.026
That's not his fault.

17:40.058 --> 17:41.861
He's 243 years old.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.263
He doesn't exactly
get the prom.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.766
But he should, if he...

17:46.798 --> 17:48.401
Will, it's okay.

17:48.434 --> 17:51.538
You don't have to
make him the bad guy.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.240
But that's
the best friend's job,

17:54.273 --> 17:56.576
vilifying and grousing.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.878
Usually, yeah.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.748
But he's right.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.651
I mean, I think maybe,

18:04.683 --> 18:06.685
in the long run,
that he's right.

18:07.987 --> 18:12.159
Yeah, I think he is.

18:12.192 --> 18:15.894
I mean, I tried to hope
for the best, but...

18:15.928 --> 18:18.565
I'm sorry.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.666
It must be horrible.

18:22.501 --> 18:25.505
I think horrible
is still coming.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.173
Right now, it's worse.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.179
(crying):
Right now, I'm just trying
to keep from dying.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.347
Oh, Buffy.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.019
I can't breathe, Will.

18:40.051 --> 18:42.521
I feel like I can't breathe.

18:42.555 --> 18:46.226
(sobbing)
Oh...

18:53.400 --> 18:55.402
(snarling)

19:24.896 --> 19:28.234
Okay. How long does it take you
to buy a damn dress?

19:28.268 --> 19:30.169
Xander!

19:30.202 --> 19:32.638
I, uh...
I'm considering things

19:32.672 --> 19:34.039
a little more
carefully nowadays.

19:34.073 --> 19:37.076
I don't want to get stuck
with another dud.

19:37.108 --> 19:39.246
Well, this should
work for you.

19:39.278 --> 19:42.147
It positively
screams "nympho."

19:42.181 --> 19:43.982
Is this a customer or a friend?

19:44.016 --> 19:46.919
Neither. Just stopped by for my
daily helping of bile.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.488
So you better get back to work
and quit goofing.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.423
Mrs. Finkle so has it
in for you.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.362
You work here?

19:55.394 --> 19:57.028
(sighs deeply)

19:57.063 --> 19:59.665
Yes. Yes, I work here.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.434
But, uh, why?

20:02.469 --> 20:04.737
I'm trying
to buy a dress.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.173
But don't you already
have all the dresses?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.277
I have nothing, okay?

20:10.309 --> 20:13.279
No dresses,
no cell phone, no car.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.114
Everything has been taken away

20:15.146 --> 20:17.549
because Daddy made a little
mistake on his taxes...

20:17.584 --> 20:20.051
for the last 12 years.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.788
Satisfied?

20:21.820 --> 20:23.756
Are you a happy Xander now?

20:23.789 --> 20:25.692
I'm broke.

20:25.724 --> 20:29.528
I can't go to any of the
colleges that accepted me,

20:29.561 --> 20:32.131
and I can't stay home,
because we no longer have one.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.969
Uh, wow.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.605
Yeah, neat-o!

20:38.637 --> 20:40.472
Now you can run along
and tell all of your friends

20:40.507 --> 20:41.941
how Cordy finally got hers.

20:41.973 --> 20:43.875
How she has to
work part-time just to get

20:43.910 --> 20:45.978
a lousy prom dress on layaway!

20:48.114 --> 20:50.115
And how she has
to wear a name tag.

20:50.148 --> 20:53.452
Oh, I'm a name-tag person.
Don't leave that out.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.654
The story just wouldn't
have the same punch.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.123
(customers screaming)

20:57.155 --> 20:59.125
(growling)

21:02.929 --> 21:04.163
(roars)

21:26.353 --> 21:29.321
And you say the creature
just stopped?

21:29.355 --> 21:30.589
Yeah.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.759
Right there.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.861
See, it's-it's like
he just realized...

21:34.894 --> 21:37.329
he forgot to put money
in the meter or something.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.631
The other part that
totally weirded me out?

21:38.664 --> 21:40.132
That thing had good taste.

21:40.165 --> 21:41.433
I mean, he chucked Xander

21:41.468 --> 21:43.169
and went right for
the formal wear.

21:43.201 --> 21:44.770
That's right.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.972
He left behind his copy
of Monster's Wear Daily.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.307
I'm serious.

21:48.340 --> 21:50.209
Look at the outfit
that Xander's wearing.

21:50.241 --> 21:52.944
Now look at the kid that
the monster went after.

21:52.979 --> 21:56.115
Very smooth lines...
till he was shredded.

21:56.147 --> 21:57.616
(tape rewinds)

21:57.650 --> 21:59.018
I don't want to
see it again.

21:59.050 --> 22:02.954
Buffy, um, I know
it's horrible,

22:02.989 --> 22:04.990
but if you're gonna
hunt this creature,

22:05.023 --> 22:07.894
you should study it.
Think I got it.

22:07.926 --> 22:09.695
She's right.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.531
I mean, you've seen one big,
hairy bringer of death,

22:12.565 --> 22:14.733
you've seen them all.
WESLEY:
Not really.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.236
If I'm not mistaken,
this is a hellhound.

22:17.269 --> 22:20.406
Yes.
It's particularly vicious.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.208
It's a sort of, um,

22:22.240 --> 22:24.143
demon foot soldier,

22:24.175 --> 22:27.747
bred during the Mahkash Wars.

22:27.779 --> 22:30.849
Trained solely to kill, they...

22:30.883 --> 22:33.318
feed off the brains
of their foes.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.586
Look! Right there!
Zoom in on that.

22:34.621 --> 22:35.855
It's a videotape.

22:35.887 --> 22:37.155
So?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.525
They do it on television
all the time.

22:38.557 --> 22:40.358
Not with a regular VCR,
they don't.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.862
Perhaps we could
stay on the topic for once.

22:42.894 --> 22:46.398
What, uh, were you
doing with Xander?

22:46.432 --> 22:47.933
CORDELIA:
What?

22:47.967 --> 22:50.102
Um, I was...

22:50.135 --> 22:51.837
Burning a hole

22:51.871 --> 22:53.405
in daddy's wallet, as usual.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.273
I just bumped into her

22:55.307 --> 22:56.742
during my tuxedo hunt.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.911
OZ:
What's that?

22:58.944 --> 23:00.078
Hey, pause it.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.346
Guys, it's just a normal VCR.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.515
It doesn't...

23:02.548 --> 23:04.717
Oh, wait.
Uh... (chuckles)

23:04.750 --> 23:07.118
It can do pause.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.855
(with British accent):
Hello, hellhound raiser.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.459
OZ:
Tucker Wells.
He was in my chem lab.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.695
Let me guess.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.364
He was quiet, kept to himself,

23:18.396 --> 23:20.567
but always seemed like
a nice young man.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.801
Well, he didn't seem
the murderous type, anyway.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.903
Something must've
happened to him.

23:27.239 --> 23:31.042
How's it going
over there, Buff?

23:31.076 --> 23:33.412
Fine.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.413
Well, I just wanted to say
that your impersonation

23:35.448 --> 23:38.049
of an inanimate object
is really coming along.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.786
Thanks.

23:39.818 --> 23:41.554
WILLOW:
Ooh, ooh!

23:41.587 --> 23:44.022
I got into
Tucker's e-mail account.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.929
Listen to this message
Tucker sent

23:49.961 --> 23:52.064
to this kid David Metz
at school last week.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.667
"The Sunnydale High lemmings
have no idea what awaits them.

23:55.701 --> 23:58.104
Their big night will be
their last night."

23:58.136 --> 24:01.440
So we have a threat
against the students

24:01.473 --> 24:02.808
on their big night,

24:02.842 --> 24:06.011
a hellhound trained

24:06.045 --> 24:07.846
to attack people
in formal wear...

24:07.880 --> 24:10.982
Oh. Are we all
catching up now?

24:11.017 --> 24:13.184
GILES:
This Tucker is planning
to attack the prom tonight.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.086
Once again, the Hellmouth

24:15.121 --> 24:16.823
puts the "special"
in "special occasion."

24:16.855 --> 24:19.191
XANDER:
Why do I even buy tickets
for these things,

24:19.224 --> 24:20.660
I ask you?

24:20.692 --> 24:23.429
I wonder if I can
take my dress back?

24:23.461 --> 24:24.631
Don't you dare.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.633
But Tucker's gonna...

24:26.665 --> 24:29.268
No. You guys are gonna
have a prom.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.136
The kind of prom that
everyone should have.

24:31.170 --> 24:34.173
I'm gonna give
you all a nice,

24:34.205 --> 24:36.776
fun, normal evening,

24:36.808 --> 24:38.443
if I have to kill
every single person

24:38.477 --> 24:40.078
on the face of the Earth
to do it.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.015
Yay?

24:46.818 --> 24:48.721
Okay, Wes,
why don't you go
to Tucker's house?

24:48.755 --> 24:50.722
He's probably not there,
but it's worth a shot.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.625
All right. Uh, perhaps
strength in numbers...

24:52.659 --> 24:54.460
You can take Cordy.

24:54.492 --> 24:56.628
If that's your plan,
all right. All right.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.365
What about the others?

24:59.397 --> 25:01.834
Oz, you said you know
this David kid
that Tucker e-mailed?

25:01.867 --> 25:04.303
Why don't you and Will
track him down,

25:04.336 --> 25:05.837
see what he knows,
if he's involved.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.506
We're on it.

25:07.539 --> 25:09.508
And you know what? Could you
two check the magic shop?

25:09.541 --> 25:11.477
WESLEY:
Magic shop?

25:11.509 --> 25:12.912
Yeah, it's right next to
the dress store on Main.

25:12.944 --> 25:15.013
XANDER:
I can swing that one.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.248
What's the mission?

25:16.281 --> 25:17.650
See if anyone's been in

25:17.683 --> 25:19.085
buying supplies
to raise a hellhound.

25:19.117 --> 25:21.587
Gotcha.
Or check and see...

25:21.621 --> 25:23.521
who's been stocking up
on hellhound Snausages.

25:23.556 --> 25:26.025
I hear those pups'll do anything
for a tasty treat.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.761
Giles, you say
this thing eats brains.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.698
Any brains?

25:31.730 --> 25:34.032
Um, I suppose...

25:34.066 --> 25:35.634
Then Tucker must be
feeding it, right?

25:37.068 --> 25:38.605
Yeah, yeah.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.007
This kid orders cow brains
a couple times a week.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.576
Oh, uh...

25:43.609 --> 25:45.711
it goes to
this address.

25:45.744 --> 25:48.013
(chuckles) Good luck.
He's a weird kid.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.083
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.569
What are you doing here?

26:13.105 --> 26:14.539
Hello to you, too.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.076
Sorry, I...

26:17.108 --> 26:19.244
I'm just surprised.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.212
Me, too.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.981
I don't know why, though.

26:23.015 --> 26:26.184
I mean, where did I think
you get your blood, McPlasma's?

26:31.190 --> 26:32.490
How are you?

26:32.523 --> 26:34.393
Right as rain.

26:34.425 --> 26:36.427
Whatever that means.

26:37.963 --> 26:39.565
Don't look at me like that.

26:39.597 --> 26:42.134
I can lie to you
if I want to now.

26:42.167 --> 26:43.602
We're ex, remember?

26:43.635 --> 26:45.136
If it means anything,
I miss you.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.773
Can we not, please?

26:47.807 --> 26:49.909
When I think about us,

26:49.942 --> 26:53.112
I have this tendency
to sort of go catatonic,

26:53.144 --> 26:55.413
and I really can't afford
to do that right now.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.284
I've gotta stop a crazy from
pulling a Carrie at the prom.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.252
You're still
planning to go?

27:01.287 --> 27:03.823
Strictly in
a chaperone capacity,

27:03.855 --> 27:06.157
but it's fine.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.794
I mean, I'm...

27:07.826 --> 27:09.361
cool with going stag.

27:09.394 --> 27:10.930
I'm over the whole

27:10.962 --> 27:13.432
"Buffy gets one perfect
high school moment" thing,

27:13.464 --> 27:16.836
but I'm certainly not gonna
let some subhuman ruin it

27:16.868 --> 27:18.770
for the rest
of the senior class.

27:18.805 --> 27:21.207
Let me help you.
I'm okay.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.675
If you ever
need my help...
Look, I got it.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.316
Thanks.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.798
Hey, don't forget
your dress.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.799
Aren't you
wearing it tonight?

27:47.834 --> 27:49.468
As much as I hate
to admit it,

27:49.500 --> 27:51.903
I haven't finished
paying for it yet.

27:51.938 --> 27:53.705
Well, somebody did.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.040
What? Who?

28:06.719 --> 28:09.087
Zeroes all around,
Buff.
Sorry.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.589
Make not with the long faces.
I got the address.

28:11.623 --> 28:14.326
Now, the prom starts
in a little while.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.228
I want you guys to go on,
and I will catch up with you

28:16.261 --> 28:17.864
as soon as I put a lid
on this jerk.

28:17.896 --> 28:19.330
What? No way.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.099
We can't just
leave you, Buff.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.734
Buffy, they're right.
You need...

28:22.769 --> 28:25.104
To see taillights.
Hit the door.

28:25.136 --> 28:26.372
I have everything
under control.

28:26.404 --> 28:27.605
Buffy, it makes
sense to...

28:27.638 --> 28:28.941
BUFFY:
Have...

28:28.974 --> 28:31.410
a nice time.

28:31.442 --> 28:33.545
Okay, then.
See ya.

28:37.282 --> 28:38.549
I want you at the gym.

28:38.584 --> 28:40.486
Keep an eye on them
till I get there.

28:42.221 --> 28:45.023
I don't have to tell you
you're being rather rash.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.961
Finding an address hardly
adds up to case closed.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.896
Look, it's done.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.398
You want to go after them and
tell them that they can't go?

28:53.432 --> 28:55.233
That all of their
planning and dreaming

28:55.267 --> 28:57.103
was for nothing?

28:57.135 --> 28:58.470
That they can't spend tonight
with their honeys,

28:58.503 --> 28:59.738
of all nights?

28:59.771 --> 29:01.007
(sets down bow)

29:07.779 --> 29:09.781
Angel's not
taking you, is he?

29:12.451 --> 29:14.720
Angel's leaving me.

29:14.752 --> 29:16.255
He's leaving town.

29:18.624 --> 29:20.792
Buffy, I'm sorry.

29:25.330 --> 29:28.134
I don't really know
what to say.

29:28.166 --> 29:31.002
Um, I understand that
um, this sort of thing...

29:31.037 --> 29:33.806
requires ice cream
of some kind.

29:35.473 --> 29:37.943
Ice cream will come.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.511
First, I want to
take out psycho boy.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.347
You sure?

29:42.381 --> 29:44.083
Great thing about
being a slayer:

29:44.115 --> 29:45.984
kicking ass is comfort food.

29:51.857 --> 29:54.359
(dance music plays)

29:56.194 --> 29:58.297
(laughter, chatter)

30:03.669 --> 30:07.538
ANYA:
So she wished her husband's head
would explode, which was great,

30:07.573 --> 30:09.708
except we were standing
three feet from him at the time.

30:09.740 --> 30:10.977
What a mess.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.377
Of course, you know,
during the plague,

30:12.411 --> 30:14.046
it was always parts
falling off, but...

30:14.079 --> 30:15.882
well, that got pretty old

30:15.914 --> 30:17.983
since really they pretty much
were anyway, and...

30:18.017 --> 30:20.318
Till the Renaissance, that was
a breath of fresh air...

30:20.352 --> 30:22.453
But I must say, this is
all rather odd to me.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.057
Oh, yes. Being at
an all-male preparatory,

30:25.090 --> 30:26.959
we didn't go in
for this sort of thing.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.660
No, of course not.

30:28.693 --> 30:31.630
Unless you count the nights
you made the lowerclassmen

30:31.663 --> 30:33.199
get up as girls
and watched them...

30:35.834 --> 30:37.936
Dip is tasty, isn't it?

30:39.905 --> 30:42.641
* I have to praise you
like I should *

30:42.673 --> 30:45.376
* I have to praise you

30:45.411 --> 30:47.913
(coughing)

30:50.715 --> 30:53.551
Salsa's hot.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.721
* I have to praise you

30:59.090 --> 31:00.326
Very hot.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.930
* I have to praise you

31:03.962 --> 31:06.097
*

31:18.277 --> 31:20.546
* I have to praise you

31:26.152 --> 31:27.752
We got in.

31:27.786 --> 31:30.221
Maybe we should dance,
before we get besieged,

31:30.256 --> 31:31.589
bedeviled or beheaded
or something.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.925
It's not gonna happen.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.594
You're not even
a little nervous?

31:35.626 --> 31:37.628
You think Buffy's
gonna let us down?

31:37.663 --> 31:39.265
Want to enjoy some punch?

31:39.298 --> 31:40.731
Yes.

31:40.766 --> 31:44.569
* Through the hard times
and the good *

31:44.603 --> 31:49.375
* I have to celebrate you,
baby *

31:49.407 --> 31:50.977
* I have to praise you

31:51.009 --> 31:53.811
May I say you look...
smashing?

31:55.114 --> 31:56.414
It's a start.

31:59.184 --> 32:00.652
So then this one time,

32:00.685 --> 32:02.954
a girl wished that her ex
would cannibalize himself.

32:02.989 --> 32:05.423
Even I had a hard time watching
that one, let me tell you.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.593
XANDER:
Cordelia! Wesley.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.461
My God in heaven,
it's good to see you.

32:09.494 --> 32:11.963
How are you both?
And details, please.

32:11.998 --> 32:13.332
Very well, thank you.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.267
Yes, thank you.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.970
It looks good on you.

32:18.003 --> 32:20.405
Well, duh!

32:20.439 --> 32:22.173
* I have to praise you

32:28.279 --> 32:30.148
* I have to praise you

32:38.557 --> 32:40.558
*

32:44.563 --> 32:46.565
(hellhound growling)

32:54.539 --> 32:56.174
You ready to go...
Sorry.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.644
New plan!

32:58.676 --> 33:00.145
The prom's a go,
and you're pathetic.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.013
Maybe.

33:04.915 --> 33:07.353
Maybe not.

33:10.489 --> 33:13.224
So that's how you did it?

33:13.259 --> 33:15.027
That's how you
brainwashed the hounds

33:15.060 --> 33:16.461
to go psycho on prom?

33:16.494 --> 33:18.529
Neat, huh?
I don't get it.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.798
What kind of sicko
wants to destroy

33:20.832 --> 33:22.334
the happiest night
of a senior's life?

33:22.367 --> 33:24.569
I have my reasons.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.071
You want to go
to the prom with me?

33:26.105 --> 33:27.306
No.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.075
Whatever.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.976
Every maladjust has his reasons.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.444
Luckily for me, you're
an incompetent maladjust.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.685
Up.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.921
Okay. Now I'm gonna
lock you in here,

33:42.953 --> 33:44.756
and then I'm gonna party
like it's 19...

33:46.258 --> 33:48.259
TUCKER:
Gotta have
a redundancy system.

33:48.294 --> 33:51.430
Any "incompetent"
knows that.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.164
My three fiercest babies

33:53.199 --> 33:55.866
are on their way
to the dance right now.

33:55.901 --> 33:58.569
You think formal wear
makes them crazy?

33:58.604 --> 34:01.573
Wait till they see
the mirror ball.

34:06.144 --> 34:10.081
(students chattering, laughing)

34:10.114 --> 34:11.949
(growling)

34:14.052 --> 34:16.155
(yelps)

34:22.927 --> 34:25.496
That's right.
Follow Buffy. Good dogs.

34:34.472 --> 34:37.443
(dance music playing,
students whooping)

34:37.476 --> 34:39.545
* Yoo-hoo!

34:39.577 --> 34:41.447
* This is your celebration

34:41.480 --> 34:43.715
Oh, come on.
That song sucks.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.451
*

34:50.322 --> 34:52.922
(growling)

34:52.958 --> 34:54.159
(grunts)

35:01.300 --> 35:02.268
(hellhound whimpers)

35:05.971 --> 35:07.338
(growls)

35:07.373 --> 35:09.307
Get back!

35:16.181 --> 35:17.615
(bone snaps)

35:21.353 --> 35:22.454
Bathroom?

35:24.889 --> 35:26.824
Th-th-th-th...

35:26.858 --> 35:28.860
You're welcome.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.164
Ugh...

35:34.699 --> 35:36.702
*

35:57.188 --> 36:01.059
* This holy circus camp

36:01.092 --> 36:04.061
* Aladdin and his lamp

36:04.094 --> 36:07.164
* Of feverish daydreams

36:07.199 --> 36:09.668
* And suerte loca

36:11.369 --> 36:15.005
* My face in magazines

36:15.039 --> 36:17.543
* The lesbian James Dean

36:19.277 --> 36:23.014
* I got all I ever wanted

36:23.047 --> 36:25.083
* So I don't mind saying

36:25.115 --> 36:27.353
* This is how

36:27.385 --> 36:31.155
* The good life's
supposed to be *

36:31.188 --> 36:32.923
* The good life...

36:32.958 --> 36:34.726
Buffy, you look awesome.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.094
So do you.

36:36.126 --> 36:37.929
Everything cool?

36:37.963 --> 36:39.998
Coolest.
Devil dogs are history.

36:40.030 --> 36:41.233
How's the prom?

36:41.266 --> 36:42.833
Strangely affecting.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.003
I got all teared up when
they played "We Are Family."

36:45.036 --> 36:46.237
Everything's perfect.

36:46.271 --> 36:48.273
(whistling and applause)

36:50.942 --> 36:52.878
And the award for

36:52.911 --> 36:56.248
Sunnydale High's Class Clown
for 1999 goes to...

36:56.282 --> 36:58.983
Jack Mayhew.
(cheering)

37:04.456 --> 37:07.893
Please! Anybody can
be a prop class clown.

37:07.925 --> 37:11.128
You know, none of
the people who vote for
these things are funny.

37:11.161 --> 37:13.898
(whoops)

37:27.244 --> 37:28.614
Um...

37:28.646 --> 37:31.215
We have one more award
to give out.

37:31.248 --> 37:34.219
Is Buffy Summers here tonight?

37:34.251 --> 37:35.454
(murmuring)

37:35.487 --> 37:37.789
D-Did she, um...

37:40.257 --> 37:43.961
This is actually a new category.

37:45.496 --> 37:47.231
First time ever.

37:47.264 --> 37:50.635
I guess there were a lot
of write-in ballots and,

37:50.668 --> 37:53.003
um, well, the prom committee

37:53.038 --> 37:55.039
asked me to-to read this.

37:59.143 --> 38:01.480
"We're not good friends.

38:01.512 --> 38:04.916
"Most of us never found
the time to get to know you.

38:04.949 --> 38:07.686
"But that doesn't mean
we haven't noticed you.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.987
"We don't talk about it much,

38:10.021 --> 38:11.690
"but it's no secret
that Sunnydale High

38:11.722 --> 38:14.860
"isn't really like
other high schools.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.293
A lot of weird stuff
happens here."

38:16.327 --> 38:17.628
MALE STUDENT:
Zombies!

38:17.663 --> 38:18.797
Hyena people!

38:18.829 --> 38:19.965
STUDENT 2:
Snyder!

38:19.998 --> 38:22.701
(laughter)

38:24.635 --> 38:26.938
"But whenever
there was a problem

38:26.972 --> 38:28.840
"or something creepy happened,

38:28.873 --> 38:30.775
"you seemed to show up
and stop it.

38:30.809 --> 38:34.112
"Most of the people here
have been saved by you

38:34.144 --> 38:37.282
"or helped by you
at one time or another.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.018
"We're proud to say
that the class of '99

38:40.050 --> 38:43.153
"has the lowest mortality rate
of any graduating class

38:43.188 --> 38:44.789
in Sunnydale history."

38:44.822 --> 38:47.925
(cheering)

38:52.163 --> 38:55.567
"And we know at least
part of that is because of you.

38:55.601 --> 38:59.405
"So the senior class
offers its thanks

38:59.438 --> 39:03.041
and gives you..."
um, uh... this.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.918
It's from all of us.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.652
And it has written here...

39:14.686 --> 39:16.353
"Buffy Summers,

39:16.387 --> 39:19.425
Class Protector."

39:19.458 --> 39:21.460
(applause)

39:31.902 --> 39:33.905
*

39:57.929 --> 40:01.298
* Walking right at you

40:01.331 --> 40:04.302
* Good day, el rey

40:04.335 --> 40:07.806
* Here she comes,
walking right at you *

40:07.838 --> 40:09.407
Mr. Giles.

40:13.143 --> 40:14.512
I'd like your opinion.

40:17.483 --> 40:20.284
While the last thing I wish
to do is model bad behavior...

40:20.318 --> 40:22.387
in front of
impressionable youth,

40:22.420 --> 40:24.556
I wonder if asking
Miss Chase to dance...

40:24.590 --> 40:28.726
For God's sake, man, she's 18,

40:28.760 --> 40:31.963
and you have the emotional
maturity of a blueberry scone.

40:31.996 --> 40:34.766
Just have at it,
would you?

40:34.800 --> 40:37.802
And stop fluttering about.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.103
Right, then.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.039
Thanks for that.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.114
(slow dance music plays)

41:10.802 --> 41:12.704
This isn't bad.

41:12.737 --> 41:17.108
* I watched you suffer

41:17.141 --> 41:21.311
* A dull, aching pain

41:24.882 --> 41:30.655
* And now you decided

41:30.688 --> 41:34.793
* Just to show me the same

41:34.826 --> 41:37.161
You did good work
tonight, Buffy.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.030
And I got a little
toy surprise.

41:40.065 --> 41:41.867
(chuckles)
Yes.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.969
I had no idea
that children en masse

41:45.003 --> 41:46.804
could be... gracious.

41:46.838 --> 41:50.976
Every now and then,
people surprise you.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.543
* Can make me feel bitter

41:52.577 --> 41:53.844
Every now and then.

41:56.081 --> 42:01.085
* Or treat you unkind

42:02.588 --> 42:05.956
* Wild horses

42:08.358 --> 42:12.030
* Couldn't drag me away

42:15.199 --> 42:19.436
* Wild, wild horses

42:21.907 --> 42:26.210
* Couldn't drag me away

42:29.547 --> 42:31.215
I never thought
you'd come.

42:31.248 --> 42:33.784
It's a big night.

42:33.818 --> 42:35.085
I didn't want to miss it.

42:37.288 --> 42:39.356
It's just tonight.

42:39.389 --> 42:40.759
It doesn't mean that, uh...

42:40.791 --> 42:42.059
I know.

42:43.393 --> 42:46.231
I mean, I understand.

42:49.434 --> 42:51.168
Will you dance with me?

42:54.304 --> 42:57.307
* Tears must be cried

42:59.911 --> 43:04.014
* Let's do some living

43:06.016 --> 43:11.289
* Oh, after we die

43:12.757 --> 43:16.961
* Wild horses

43:18.362 --> 43:22.800
* Couldn't drag me away

43:25.637 --> 43:29.807
* Wild, wild horses

43:31.208 --> 43:36.146
* Couldn't drag me away

43:38.115 --> 43:42.452
* Wild, wild horses

43:42.487 --> 43:44.489
* Ooh

43:44.521 --> 43:46.824
* We'll ride them someday...

44:21.760 --> 44:24.195
Grr. Argh.
