13:32.619 --> 13:35.452
and this just feels like
what I was born to do.

13:35.535 --> 13:37.494
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

13:39.786 --> 13:43.035
I love digging for clues,
I love putting things together.

13:43.118 --> 13:44.577
I love the puzzling part of it.

13:44.661 --> 13:47.410
I love being wrong
because sometimes it proves

13:47.494 --> 13:49.869
that you didn't know enough,
and you learn new techniques.

13:49.952 --> 13:52.535
I love every single aspect
of it.

13:55.077 --> 13:58.202
MAN: What led you
to starting this blog?

13:58.285 --> 14:01.327
MICHELLE: Well, I always
followed crime stories,

14:01.410 --> 14:02.702
and I was always a writer.

14:02.786 --> 14:07.285
So I really just--
I started it on a lark, really.

14:07.369 --> 14:09.744
KAREN KILGARIFF: I started
reading Michelle's blog,

14:09.827 --> 14:13.619
True Crime Diary, basically
on a recommendation.

14:13.702 --> 14:16.952
And I was obsessed with it.
Like, she couldn't post enough.

14:18.118 --> 14:21.160
Her stories
and the way she told them,

14:21.243 --> 14:22.661
made them so memorable.

14:22.744 --> 14:25.118
You know,
they all stuck with you.

14:25.202 --> 14:28.535
MICHELLE: Whatever light
existed was blotted out.

14:28.619 --> 14:32.369
The sound of hurried footsteps
faded away.

14:32.452 --> 14:34.118
It had that feeling of, like,

14:34.202 --> 14:36.243
under the blanket
with a flashlight at night.

14:36.327 --> 14:41.035
I was kind of amazed
at how quickly it caught on.

14:41.118 --> 14:44.369
KAREN: When people talk to me
about finding that blog,

14:44.452 --> 14:46.494
there's a real excitement
where people are like,

14:46.577 --> 14:48.535
"I've read every single post."

14:48.619 --> 14:50.827
It was like they were
drug addicts or something.

14:50.911 --> 14:52.285
MICHELLE: I would say
about a year in,

14:52.369 --> 14:54.410
I started to realize I wasn't
really in an echo chamber,

14:54.494 --> 14:57.911
that people were kind of
starting to read it
and respond to it.

14:57.993 --> 15:00.993
KAREN: Most of the TV shows
that would cover these stories

15:01.077 --> 15:04.577
were very cold
or really kind of exploitive.

15:04.661 --> 15:06.702
We spent a bunch of time

15:06.786 --> 15:10.118
watching a reenactment
of a beautiful young actress

15:10.202 --> 15:13.410
being attacked over and over
while wearing lingerie.

15:13.494 --> 15:14.744
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

15:14.827 --> 15:18.911
KAREN: But Michelle's blog kind
of changed, I think, the focus.

15:18.993 --> 15:20.619
She personalized those people.

15:20.702 --> 15:24.744
If you can remind people
about the humanity

15:24.827 --> 15:26.410
at the other end of that gun.

15:26.494 --> 15:29.911
"This was a person with hopes
and dreams, with family,

15:29.993 --> 15:31.827
that could've
done this, this, or this."

15:31.911 --> 15:33.118
That's what Michelle did
in her writing.

15:33.202 --> 15:34.869
CHRISTINE BLACKBURN:
All right. Here we go, folks.

15:34.952 --> 15:36.202
We've got Michelle McNamara.

15:36.285 --> 15:38.202
She's a writer
and a web sleuth.

15:38.285 --> 15:40.952
She has taught college writing,
uh, worked as an editor,

15:41.035 --> 15:44.077
sold TV pilots, and also
consulted for  Dateline.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.577
She is a truth seeker
is what she is.

15:46.661 --> 15:48.077
-(MICHELLE LAUGHS)
-Let's face it.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.369
You have a career,
you have a life

15:49.452 --> 15:51.035
because people are always
gonna get murdered.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.661
-MICHELLE: Well. Yeah.
The murder biz.
-You deal with the devil.

15:54.744 --> 15:56.744
She was a pioneer,
she was somebody

15:56.827 --> 15:59.118
who was creating, uh,
you know, something new.

15:59.202 --> 16:01.869
Yeah.
Nothing was like that in 2007.

16:03.243 --> 16:04.744
PATTON: Hi, Los Angeles.

16:04.827 --> 16:06.786
Patton Oswalt
on  Jonesy's Jukebox.

16:06.869 --> 16:09.160
That was "Ceremony"
by New Order.

16:09.243 --> 16:11.410
I am sitting here
with the lovely and intelligent

16:11.494 --> 16:12.952
Michelle McNamara, my wife,

16:13.035 --> 16:17.118
who is the writer and creator
of truecrimediary dot com.

16:17.202 --> 16:18.993
I think this is one of
the best written

16:19.077 --> 16:21.243
and creepiest crime blogs
on the web.

16:21.327 --> 16:23.160
MICHELLE: You're such
a good husband.  (LAUGHS)

16:23.243 --> 16:25.327
PATTON: It is! No, it's a good--
I'm telling you, man.

16:25.410 --> 16:28.661
If this site was awful, I would
have to be lying all the time.

16:28.744 --> 16:30.619
-(MICHELLE LAUGHS)
-So, um, Michelle.

16:30.702 --> 16:32.118
-MICHELLE: Mm-hmm?
-You were telling me about

16:32.202 --> 16:34.577
something going on
in the Northwest right now.

16:36.577 --> 16:38.535
MICHELLE: Yeah, I mean,
I have a theory that there is

16:38.619 --> 16:41.577
a serial killer
operating in the Northwest

16:41.661 --> 16:44.869
who is killing couples,
like, out camping.

16:44.952 --> 16:47.661
There's been about
four or five cases

16:47.744 --> 16:49.952
where there seems
to be no motive

16:50.035 --> 16:52.077
and they are both shot
in the head.

16:53.535 --> 16:55.744
PATTON: I remember
the Jenner case so clearly.

16:55.827 --> 16:57.869
That was such
a turning point for her

16:57.952 --> 17:00.327
because she became
very fascinated

17:00.410 --> 17:02.535
with how crimes
are investigated.

17:03.911 --> 17:06.327
MICHELLE: It's not easy
to get to this beach.

17:06.410 --> 17:08.661
You have to negotiate
a tricky path

17:08.744 --> 17:10.077
down a rocky cliff.

17:14.494 --> 17:16.369
On Wednesday, August 18th,

17:16.452 --> 17:19.827
a sheriff's helicopter
noticed two sleeping bags

17:19.911 --> 17:21.577
on Fish Head Beach.

17:21.661 --> 17:24.702
Despite the noise and nearness
of the helicopter,

17:24.786 --> 17:28.786
the figures in the sleeping
bags didn't move.

17:28.869 --> 17:32.619
Lindsay and Jason had each been
shot in the head at close range

17:32.702 --> 17:36.035
with a .45 caliber
Marlin rifle.

17:36.118 --> 17:37.494
PATTON: That is a creepy beach.

17:37.577 --> 17:38.869
MICHELLE: I showed you
all that evidence--

17:38.952 --> 17:41.369
or all that footage,
it's a very creepy beach.

17:41.452 --> 17:44.410
PATTON: The act of actually
going to the crime scene

17:44.494 --> 17:46.993
and walking the case
made her go, "Oh...

17:47.077 --> 17:48.702
Yeah, I can't just be clicking
on the internet.

17:48.786 --> 17:52.577
I have to go visit places
and look at places."

17:52.661 --> 17:55.577
It changed the way
she wrote about it.

17:55.661 --> 17:58.077
DICK GORDON: When did you make
the shift, Michelle,

17:58.160 --> 18:01.744
from just reading stuff
and absorbing it

18:01.827 --> 18:04.077
to thinking,
"I can do something here.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.327
I can start trying to connect
dots that I might see

18:07.410 --> 18:08.827
that others have missed"?

18:08.911 --> 18:11.243
MICHELLE: There was this,
um, kind of national news

18:11.327 --> 18:13.369
about a kidnapping
that took place in Missouri.

18:13.452 --> 18:16.327
This boy had been kidnapped
from a bus stop.

18:16.410 --> 18:19.494
And it immediately reminded me
of a lesser known case

18:19.577 --> 18:21.077
that had happened
five years before

18:21.160 --> 18:22.661
that no one else
was talking about,

18:22.744 --> 18:24.869
but there were things
that were interesting to me.

18:24.952 --> 18:26.077
So I posted, um,

18:26.160 --> 18:28.160
that I think whoever took
this boy, Ben Ownby,

18:28.243 --> 18:30.661
probably also took this kid,
Shawn Hornbeck.

18:30.744 --> 18:32.577
And I posted it on a Wednesday.

18:32.661 --> 18:34.661
That Friday,
the police in St. Louis

18:34.744 --> 18:38.035
went to investigate a tip about
where Ben Ownby might be,

18:38.118 --> 18:39.410
and they knocked on the door,

18:39.494 --> 18:41.619
and Shawn Hornbeck
opened the door.

18:41.702 --> 18:44.118
DICK: You mean, a kid who'd been
kidnapped years earlier

18:44.202 --> 18:46.077
-answered the door?
-MICHELLE: Right. Right.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.118
And again, this was three days
after I had posted,

18:48.202 --> 18:50.744
"I think they're probably
taken by the same person."

18:51.702 --> 18:53.285
That was a big moment for me.

18:53.369 --> 18:56.744
I could start to see where my
head full of facts and details

18:56.827 --> 18:59.285
could intersect
with technology.

18:59.369 --> 19:03.077
You know, I had started
to kind of use internet tools

19:03.160 --> 19:05.369
to figure out that
they seemed similar

19:05.452 --> 19:07.035
and that they might be
connected.

19:07.118 --> 19:08.619
JACKIE KASHIAN:
It's got to be amazing

19:08.702 --> 19:10.452
when you find
a new sort of clue.

19:10.535 --> 19:12.327
MICHELLE:
When people describe, like,

19:12.410 --> 19:13.827
porn addiction or something.
And...

19:13.911 --> 19:15.952
-No, this is really weird.
-JACKIE: (CHUCKLES) Right.

19:16.035 --> 19:18.869
MICHELLE: I can't stop myself,
time disappears.

19:18.952 --> 19:19.993
JACKIE: Oh, right.

19:20.077 --> 19:21.827
MICHELLE: You know,
all those things happen.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.160
JACKIE:
So it's a genuine addiction?

19:23.243 --> 19:24.661
-MICHELLE: Yeah. Yeah.
-JACKIE: You are onboard.

19:24.744 --> 19:26.118
Are you doing this now,
currently?

19:26.202 --> 19:27.993
MICHELLE: Oh, every night,
until like 2:00 in the morning.

19:28.077 --> 19:29.077
(JACKIE LAUGHS)

19:30.410 --> 19:32.702
I cannot remember

19:32.786 --> 19:34.827
the specific time we started
talking about EAR/ONS

19:34.911 --> 19:37.327
because every day,
there was so many cases

19:37.410 --> 19:38.452
she was following up.

19:38.535 --> 19:41.619
And then... just organically,

19:41.702 --> 19:43.952
that became the thing
that got narrowed down.

19:47.035 --> 19:48.744
NANCY MILLER:
I looked at Michelle's blog,

19:48.827 --> 19:52.327
truecrimediary dot com,
and I was really intrigued.

19:52.410 --> 19:54.535
So she and I first met in 2011

19:54.619 --> 19:56.661
to talk about
some story ideas.

19:56.744 --> 19:59.369
And she was so smart

19:59.452 --> 20:04.035
and so... (SIGHS) cool
and down to earth.

20:04.118 --> 20:05.869
And her shit was together.

20:05.952 --> 20:08.827
Not only that, I really liked
how she was unpretentious

20:08.911 --> 20:12.702
in a, obviously, pretty
pretentious city and business.

20:12.786 --> 20:14.869
I remember
she wore these, like, clogs.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.869
She had a backpack
like a-- like a--

20:16.952 --> 20:18.243
that she bought at Target.

20:18.327 --> 20:21.035
And she just showed up totally
like in a-- in a flannel shirt

20:21.118 --> 20:24.118
and just as like
low-key as possible.

20:24.202 --> 20:26.535
So we meet up,
we go to this cafe.

20:26.619 --> 20:28.577
I think we met there
like at 11:00

20:28.661 --> 20:30.118
and probably didn't leave

20:30.202 --> 20:32.869
until about 3:00
in the afternoon.

20:32.952 --> 20:37.786
Because she started telling me
this story about this guy.

20:39.786 --> 20:41.369
MICHELLE: The case
that is sort of my--

20:41.452 --> 20:43.744
the biggest case that
I'm most obsessed with is...

20:43.827 --> 20:47.285
The short version is,
basically, he's the worst
serial offender

20:47.369 --> 20:50.243
in modern history
that no one really knows about.

20:50.327 --> 20:53.077
He raped over 50 women
in California

20:53.160 --> 20:55.035
and killed 10 people.

20:55.118 --> 20:58.035
Um, and he's never been caught.

20:58.993 --> 21:00.661
There's no one
like him out there.

21:00.744 --> 21:02.202
There hasn't been before.

21:02.285 --> 21:06.243
He is a such a unique offender.

21:06.327 --> 21:09.494
This guy
was one of the most prolific,

21:09.577 --> 21:12.452
violent, brutal, serial rapists,

21:12.535 --> 21:14.410
and eventually a murderer.

21:14.494 --> 21:16.202
And I had never heard of him.

21:16.285 --> 21:17.661
Like you'd heard
of Zodiac Killer,

21:17.744 --> 21:19.786
you heard Son of Sam,
like you hear all of these big--

21:19.869 --> 21:22.202
especially in the '70s and '80s,
which seemed to be

21:22.285 --> 21:26.160
the most fertile period
for these serial killer stories.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.619
And I had never heard of him.

21:28.702 --> 21:30.786
MICHELLE: He would eat
in the people's kitchens,

21:30.869 --> 21:32.952
he would hide ligatures
under cushions

21:33.035 --> 21:34.535
so that when he was attacking,

21:34.619 --> 21:35.786
you suddenly
would watch this man

21:35.869 --> 21:37.243
take a ligature
under your cushion,

21:37.327 --> 21:39.285
you didn't even know
he had been in your house.

21:39.369 --> 21:41.160
NANCY: I'm drinking this,
like, Arnold Palmer

21:41.243 --> 21:43.285
that's like 36,000 ounces,

21:43.369 --> 21:45.786
and I'm like sipping on it
and drinking it and drinking it

21:45.869 --> 21:47.452
as she's telling me this story.

21:47.535 --> 21:49.786
I needed to go
to the bathroom really badly

21:49.869 --> 21:52.786
because my bladder
was like about to burst.

21:52.869 --> 21:54.702
But I couldn't.
I couldn't.

21:54.786 --> 21:57.160
And I just kept listening,
and listening and listening.

21:57.243 --> 21:59.118
And that's how I knew
it was a great story.

21:59.202 --> 22:01.702
You know, the challenge
for any magazine editor,

22:01.786 --> 22:03.494
any reporter and writer, is...

22:03.577 --> 22:06.410
sure, you have, like, a person
or you have a topic,

22:06.494 --> 22:09.452
really interesting guy
from a long time ago,

22:09.535 --> 22:11.452
but there was nothing new
to say yet.

22:15.285 --> 22:17.410
MICHELLE: What's fascinating
to me about this case,

22:17.494 --> 22:20.369
is that it's rich
with so many clues

22:20.452 --> 22:22.993
and it really seems to me
that it's just

22:23.077 --> 22:25.035
time, energy, and curiosity.

22:25.118 --> 22:28.786
And that, um--
and frankly it should be solved.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.702
I mean, it just should be.

22:33.744 --> 22:37.410
When I was so, um, gripped
by Crompton's book,

22:37.494 --> 22:41.369
I googled "East Area Rapist
Original Night Stalker."

22:41.452 --> 22:43.869
And this came up, this link,

22:43.952 --> 22:46.285
to the  Cold Case Files
message board.

22:47.827 --> 22:49.243
And I was just...

22:49.327 --> 22:51.160
You know,
for someone like me, again,

22:51.243 --> 22:54.077
it's like, "Oh, wow,
look at all these--

22:54.160 --> 22:55.285
Oh, wow."

22:55.369 --> 22:56.535
-(WOMAN LAUGHING)
-Like, "Wait!

22:56.619 --> 22:59.702
Who would spend,
you know, all this time..."

22:59.786 --> 23:00.952
Well, me, I guess,

and I've read 20,000 posts.

23:06.911 --> 23:08.369
You know,
certainly in this case,

23:08.452 --> 23:10.535
there was this community
of people.

23:10.619 --> 23:12.869
They all had different reasons
for being involved in it.

23:12.952 --> 23:14.952
Some of them, you know,
were from Sacramento

23:15.035 --> 23:17.285
and remembered
and were still fearful

23:17.369 --> 23:18.952
and wanted to see it closed.

23:22.619 --> 23:24.993
Others were more
kind of just, um,

23:25.077 --> 23:27.327
data mining,
sleuth kind of people.

23:31.452 --> 23:32.827
You know, this was unique to me

23:32.911 --> 23:34.327
because I've never actually
been part of

23:34.410 --> 23:36.869
this sort of message board
community before.

23:36.952 --> 23:40.077
They throw around clues,
you know, you just--

23:40.160 --> 23:42.535
you go down the rabbit hole
kind of gleefully,

23:42.619 --> 23:45.911
like, "Oh, there's just this
unending thread of information

23:45.993 --> 23:47.369

It's an awkward name befitting
a man who crossed jurisdictions

23:57.369 --> 24:00.494

24:15.535 --> 24:17.202
probably a few years.

24:17.285 --> 24:19.744
I was a fan
of her  True Crime Diary.

24:20.911 --> 24:23.786
I'd read  True Crime Diary
in its entirety.

So when she finally wrote
about the East Area Rapist,

it was, you know,
it was exciting.

It's not healthy.

I know the strangest details
about him.

24:34.702 --> 24:36.285

24:36.369 --> 24:38.035
I know his penis size.

He vaulted fences,
he escaped foot chases.

24:42.369 --> 24:46.202
But I believe it's the rare
moments when he was human

24:46.285 --> 24:48.952
that will be his downfall
in the end.

24:49.035 --> 24:52.952
Her writing evoked
the central, um, hook for me,

24:53.035 --> 24:53.993
which was the mystery,

24:54.077 --> 24:57.202
the question of
who is behind this crime?

24:57.285 --> 24:59.661
She wasn't
a ghoulish gore-hound.

24:59.744 --> 25:01.410
There was nothing tasteless
about her writing.

25:01.494 --> 25:03.327

MICHELLE: An impressive
community of people

25:05.202 --> 25:08.410
has come together
at an A&E sponsored website.

25:08.494 --> 25:10.827
Unlike other
unsolved mystery communities,

25:10.911 --> 25:13.619
the EAR/ONS community's
desire for justice

25:13.702 --> 25:15.993
feels strong and sincere.

25:16.077 --> 25:19.077
She reached out to me privately,
and we started corresponding,

25:19.160 --> 25:21.327

it was evident she was, like,

25:21.410 --> 25:23.744
entrenched in this case.
As was I.

MICHELLE: I just kind of...
I saw who seemed to be

25:26.285 --> 25:28.369
some of the, like,
kind of leaders on the board,

25:28.452 --> 25:30.369
and I just began kind of
personal messaging.

25:30.452 --> 25:32.285
PAUL: You know,
we started exchanging notes

25:32.369 --> 25:36.786
and, um, developed a rapport
pretty quickly.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.619
You know,
we just built mutual trust

25:38.702 --> 25:39.911
until we were just, you know,

25:39.993 --> 25:42.661
openly sharing
our work with each other.

25:42.744 --> 25:44.410
And that's when we discovered
that a lot of it

25:44.494 --> 25:46.327
had intersected.

just exchanging ideas

25:49.869 --> 25:51.202

and things like that.

I'm a longtime lurker

The case is of interest to me,

really measured and thoughtful

26:12.661 --> 26:15.702
I wanted to know if you have
any thoughts on something.

MELANIE BARBEAU: Hi, Michelle.
Thanks for trusting me

26:24.202 --> 26:25.577
with this information.

26:25.661 --> 26:26.911
I'm a Sacramento native

26:26.993 --> 26:29.661
and have been investigating
this case for years.

26:29.744 --> 26:30.869
Let's talk.

26:32.327 --> 26:33.869
MICHELLE:
I traveled to Sacramento

26:33.952 --> 26:36.869
to meet a woman
about whom I know very little,

26:36.952 --> 26:39.993
including the spelling
of her last name.

26:43.661 --> 26:46.702
The Social Worker operates
as a kind of gatekeeper

26:46.786 --> 26:49.535
between investigators
and the board community.

26:49.619 --> 26:51.494
This irks some posters

26:51.577 --> 26:54.661
who accuse her of hinting
at confidential information

26:54.744 --> 26:57.786
but then shutting down
when asked to share.

26:57.869 --> 27:00.243
She greeted me
in the parking lot

27:00.327 --> 27:03.869
by waving her arms
wildly overhead.

27:03.952 --> 27:05.702
I liked her right away.

27:06.702 --> 27:08.285
Well, we had been
in communication.

27:08.369 --> 27:10.452
I knew she was flying
into Sacramento,

27:10.535 --> 27:13.035
and she was another civilian
that was interested

27:13.118 --> 27:14.786
in the movement.

27:14.869 --> 27:17.410
And we would drive around
to the crime scenes.

27:17.494 --> 27:19.577
I would take her to the areas.

27:19.661 --> 27:22.160
And so we drove around
for hours.

27:22.243 --> 27:24.327
We're gonna go
about five miles from here.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.661
MICHELLE: Okay.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.993
MELANIE: And I'm gonna take you
to the first crime scenes first.

27:28.077 --> 27:29.202
MICHELLE: Okay.

27:29.285 --> 27:32.243
Our language just immediately
became, uh, you know,

27:32.327 --> 27:34.702
about the case facts
and about what we knew

27:34.786 --> 27:36.577
and what this,
and what do you think of that?

27:36.661 --> 27:38.744
It was a language
that nobody else probably

27:38.827 --> 27:40.911
could've understood
what we were talking about

27:40.993 --> 27:42.577

27:42.661 --> 27:44.410
or you were aware of the case.

27:44.494 --> 27:47.535
I just don't think it's gonna be
somebody that everybody thought,

the East Area Rapist."

-Yeah, I think it's gonna be

27:56.243 --> 27:57.243
MICHELLE: Right, right.

27:57.327 --> 27:59.702
Obviously, he didn't stand out
at the time.

two women getting together

28:02.077 --> 28:04.327

we're warriors,
we're on the path.

33:11.035 --> 33:13.243
I think it was May 20th.

33:14.202 --> 33:16.077
I had been doing
The King of Queens

33:16.160 --> 33:17.410
for five years,

33:17.494 --> 33:19.993
and I'd had a couple specials
at that point.

33:20.077 --> 33:22.911
But she wasn't that steeped
in the comedy scene,

33:22.993 --> 33:25.160
so she didn't know who I was.

33:25.243 --> 33:28.869
MICHELLE: This guy was funny.
More than funny.

33:28.952 --> 33:32.993
He was moody and startling
but hilarious.

33:33.077 --> 33:36.535
He could move the crowd with
the tiniest of expressions.

33:36.619 --> 33:38.327
"Irish girls," he said.

33:38.410 --> 33:40.993
He knocked the microphone
against his forehead.

33:41.077 --> 33:43.327
"Irish girls are
my kryptonite."

33:43.410 --> 33:45.702
And then I was just
sitting at the bar afterwards

33:45.786 --> 33:47.535
and she was leaving,
and she literally tapped me

33:47.619 --> 33:49.535
and just went,
"Irish women, nice." And I was--

33:49.619 --> 33:53.118
and she was so fucking, like,
steamroller gorgeous

33:53.202 --> 33:55.661
that I was just stunned.
And I ran-- I literally

33:55.744 --> 33:58.035
-ran around the street.
-(LAUGHTER)

33:58.118 --> 33:59.369
And I went, "Hey!"

33:59.452 --> 34:01.952
And then that was the first word
I ever said to her was, "Hey!"

34:02.035 --> 34:03.494
-Screaming.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

34:03.577 --> 34:05.035
And then she turned around,
and I'm like,

34:05.118 --> 34:06.452
"I'm not gonna play
any fucking games.

34:06.535 --> 34:08.327
I want your name and number
so I can take you on a date

34:08.410 --> 34:09.786
-this weekend, are you free?"
-WOMAN: Yeah!

34:09.869 --> 34:11.285
And she went, "Yeah."
I went, "Good!

34:11.369 --> 34:13.827
-Give me your number."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

34:13.911 --> 34:19.619
It was just the most awkward,
non-James Bond moment

34:19.702 --> 34:21.494
I could've had.

CAROLINE MEREDITH:
Take off my mask.

34:29.452 --> 34:32.035
PATTON: Our first date in LA,
they show movies

34:32.118 --> 34:34.118
at the Hollywood
Forever Cemetery.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.577
So we went and watched
an Italian film

34:36.661 --> 34:37.952
called  The 10th Victim.

34:42.035 --> 34:45.285
Really goofy Italian
science fiction film.

34:45.369 --> 34:47.952
I was too nervous to really
do a lot of talking that night.

34:48.035 --> 34:50.494
She did way more of the talking
because she just was--

34:50.577 --> 34:52.160
and the more we talk, I'm like,
"Oh, my God,

34:52.243 --> 34:55.160
she's so smart and so cool,
I'm gonna screw this up."

34:59.410 --> 35:01.369
I remember I called her
late at night 'cause I was up,

35:01.452 --> 35:03.285
and I'm like, "The Creature
from the Black Lagoon  is on,"

35:03.369 --> 35:05.744
and she goes, "I'm watching it!
It's one of my favorite movies."

35:05.827 --> 35:08.410
And that was one of the things
we bonded over really early.

35:08.494 --> 35:09.744
We loved that.

35:09.827 --> 35:12.160
MICHELLE: We loved many
of the same things,

35:12.243 --> 35:14.952
like  Creature
from the Black Lagoon,

35:15.035 --> 35:18.327
tales of the grim and offbeat,
and good food.

35:19.577 --> 35:21.786
I didn't like the way his
comedian friends,

35:21.869 --> 35:25.035
including him, seemed to tell
jokes but never listen.

35:26.494 --> 35:29.077
He thought I was thin-skinned.

35:29.160 --> 35:32.535
For a while, it seemed
it might not work.

35:33.577 --> 35:35.869
But one night,
he was saying goodbye to me,

35:35.952 --> 35:36.993
and he won me over

35:37.077 --> 35:41.202
with an adorable
Edward G. Robinson impression.

35:41.285 --> 35:43.619
And I was doing that "Yeah, see.

35:43.702 --> 35:45.619
Look at the getaway sticks
on that tomato."

35:45.702 --> 35:47.952
Like, you--
like, chatting her up,

35:48.035 --> 35:50.118
but in that old kinda slang,

35:50.202 --> 35:51.993
and she thought
that was so hilarious.

35:52.077 --> 35:54.410
MICHELLE: I laughed
and grabbed him.

35:54.993 --> 35:56.744
"More," I said.

35:56.827 --> 35:59.869
PATTON: "Ooh, look at the
keister on that hot number."

35:59.952 --> 36:02.035
You know, couples have in-jokes
with each other,

36:02.118 --> 36:04.410
and that became
one of my, you know...

36:04.494 --> 36:06.869
It was just all that '30s
gangster slang.

36:06.952 --> 36:09.452
I'd, you know,
however you wanna say it.

36:09.535 --> 36:10.952
I can't-- Oh, God.

36:12.786 --> 36:15.035
MICHELLE: I wouldn't let him go.

36:15.118 --> 36:19.285
After a while, we gave up
and moved in together.

36:19.369 --> 36:21.786
PATTON: I made
this custom desk for her

36:21.869 --> 36:24.410
that was in this kind of
half-moon shape.

36:24.494 --> 36:28.118
Like, I wanted her to have,
like, this command center.

36:28.202 --> 36:30.952
MICHELLE: I've never tired
of the Robinson impression.

36:32.452 --> 36:34.577
I've never tired of Patton.

that she was a marrying

36:39.160 --> 36:41.827
a famous person,
and as much as she lived a life

36:41.911 --> 36:45.452
that, you know, a lot of people
might fantasize about,

36:45.535 --> 36:47.369
none of that mattered to her.

36:47.452 --> 36:48.786
And I mean really.

36:50.452 --> 36:53.410
She was a regular
salt-of-the-earth

36:53.494 --> 36:55.869
Midwestern gal.

36:55.952 --> 36:58.494
And she didn't wanna be
anything else.

PATTON:
The whole being photographed

37:00.577 --> 37:02.410
and going to premieres
and stuff,

37:02.494 --> 37:04.035
that meant nothing to her.

37:04.118 --> 37:05.744
MAN: Patton,
can we get a quick single?

37:05.827 --> 37:07.369
Especially if you're someone
who's thinking,

37:07.452 --> 37:08.786
"I wanna go home
and write later,

37:08.869 --> 37:10.285
I wanna get up tomorrow
and write."

37:10.369 --> 37:12.410
ADAM: One of her favorite things
in the world

37:12.494 --> 37:15.202
was to be in her room
under the covers,

37:15.285 --> 37:16.827
like, with a fan, reading.

SARAH STANARD:
She went to the Oscars,
she went to the Grammys.

37:23.744 --> 37:26.035
We just always giggled about
it. I mean, it was just, like,

37:26.118 --> 37:28.410
so different
from how we grew up.

37:28.494 --> 37:30.410
She usually would wear black,
and she would joke

37:30.494 --> 37:33.118
that they would think
she was like a PR person.

37:33.202 --> 37:35.619
She was just an introvert.
That's all.

37:35.702 --> 37:38.327
ADAM: She was really good
at making herself

37:38.410 --> 37:40.702
sort of a fly on the wall
and inconspicuous.

37:40.786 --> 37:41.827
I think it's one of the reasons

37:41.911 --> 37:43.535
she had an incredible insight
into people,

37:43.619 --> 37:44.744
she listened, she watched,

37:44.827 --> 37:47.077
she didn't need to be
the center of attention.

37:47.160 --> 37:48.702
She didn't want to be.

37:48.786 --> 37:50.577
I think she'd always been
sort of

37:50.661 --> 37:53.619
singled out as,
"You're a terrific writer."

37:53.702 --> 37:56.160
And then she got to LA
where, you know,

37:56.243 --> 37:58.661
there's a gazillion people
trying to do the same thing,

37:58.744 --> 38:00.202
and that was hard for her.

38:00.285 --> 38:02.327
She hadn't experienced,
you know,

38:02.410 --> 38:04.327
that degree
of consistent rejection

38:04.410 --> 38:06.535
and failure
and disappointment.

38:06.619 --> 38:09.369
Her ultimate dream
was always to write books

38:09.452 --> 38:11.285
or for  The New Yorker.

38:11.369 --> 38:15.577
She also really,
really wanted a child.

38:18.494 --> 38:21.702
Four years after we got married,
our daughter was born.

38:21.786 --> 38:25.035
-MICHELLE: Alice, hi.
-(ALICE COOS)

38:25.577 --> 38:26.577

38:26.661 --> 38:28.118
It was so amazing.

38:28.202 --> 38:32.535

PATTON: And I think Alice
was about two or three

38:41.118 --> 38:44.661
when Michelle was meticulously
due diligence researching

38:44.744 --> 38:47.118
about, you know, EAR/ONS.

38:47.202 --> 38:51.911
MICHELLE: In Sacramento,
the air is immediately better.

38:51.993 --> 38:55.494
Struck by the big, open spaces.

38:55.577 --> 38:58.702
A little over half a million,
or about half a million people,

38:58.786 --> 38:59.827
but feels--

38:59.911 --> 39:02.118
coming from Los Angeles,
feels so much smaller.

WAITRESS:
How are you doing in here?

39:10.327 --> 39:13.452
MICHELLE: I'm good.
Um, I might have--

39:13.535 --> 39:15.535
Okay, this is crazy.
Can I have one more latte?

39:15.619 --> 39:17.410

39:17.494 --> 39:18.993

When Michelle interviewed me,
we met for breakfast

39:28.077 --> 39:34.077
down at the Citizen Hotel
in Downtown Sacramento.

39:34.160 --> 39:38.410
Talking about the attack
is difficult, but Michelle,

39:38.494 --> 39:42.243
she was so serious
about the case.

39:42.327 --> 39:45.535
She was just the easiest person
to talk to.

39:45.619 --> 39:48.202
MICHELLE:
So, I'm from suburban Chicago.

39:48.285 --> 39:50.577
So all of this
is so foreign to me.

39:50.661 --> 39:51.744
But what I wanted--

39:51.827 --> 39:54.577
I'm trying to get back
into sort of the mindset.

39:54.661 --> 39:56.952
A lot of people will say

39:57.952 --> 40:03.243
that the EAR crimes--

40:03.952 --> 40:04.993
crime period--

40:05.077 --> 40:09.077
was kind of the end of innocence
for Sacramento.

and Sacramento Rivers.

40:21.535 --> 40:24.452
It was built up
being a commerce center,

40:24.535 --> 40:26.993
and it became
the state capital.

40:27.077 --> 40:31.619
We have both Mather Field

all the time.

40:46.786 --> 40:49.410

Seventies Sacramento,

40:58.410 --> 41:02.118
being a cop was
like a cop anywhere else.

41:02.202 --> 41:04.077
It was pretty slow.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.952
And then June comes along,
and you got this pervert

41:10.702 --> 41:15.952

a rape, 1976, October 5th.

Jane Carson
over at Wood Parkway.

41:18.869 --> 41:21.786
At the time the East Area
rape cases started,

41:21.869 --> 41:23.410
I was working homicide.

41:23.494 --> 41:24.869
And I think
it was the fifth case

41:24.952 --> 41:28.869
I was called to the scene on,
which was Jane Carson.

41:28.952 --> 41:31.118
What's the feelings
that you're going through,

41:31.202 --> 41:33.661

whether you did the right thing

41:33.744 --> 41:35.744
or whether you did
the wrong thing

41:35.827 --> 41:38.452
and could you have done
anything any differently.

41:38.535 --> 41:42.118
And I think you handled
the situation very well.

41:42.202 --> 41:44.452
JANE CARSON: Well,
I had thought of kicking him,

41:44.535 --> 41:46.118
but it would've been useless,

41:46.202 --> 41:48.077
as my hands were tied
and I was blindfolded

41:48.160 --> 41:50.243
-and my child was with me.
-CAROL: Okay.

41:51.744 --> 41:54.160
RICHARD:
When the husband left for work,

41:54.243 --> 41:56.744
the rapist was in their house
and on her.

41:56.827 --> 41:59.661
He knew down to the minute
what was going on

41:59.744 --> 42:02.911
in Jane's house
and the neighborhood.

42:02.993 --> 42:04.744
When I left there that day,
I was convinced

42:04.827 --> 42:06.911
that this probably wasn't
just a routine rape.

42:06.993 --> 42:08.494
In fact, I know it wasn't.

42:08.577 --> 42:10.993
And then I started
digging in deeper.

42:11.077 --> 42:13.077
In the meantime, we have
a couple more rapes.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.452
At that point,
there's no question

42:14.535 --> 42:18.369
we had a serial rapist.
He had a definite pattern.

42:18.452 --> 42:21.577
CAROL: When we realized that
we first had a series going,

42:21.661 --> 42:24.702
the sheriff did not want
the media to be aware of it.

42:24.786 --> 42:26.702
Because we didn't
have anything.

42:26.786 --> 42:29.702
Because of what was
happening within the rapes,

42:29.786 --> 42:31.661
he didn't want the word
to get out

42:31.744 --> 42:33.285
to make fear in the community.

42:33.369 --> 42:36.118
We just-- we just weren't ready
to handle anything coming in.

42:36.202 --> 42:38.452
You know, we didn't have
that many people working it.

"This is attack number eight.

And this victim was accosted
outside of her house

42:45.285 --> 42:48.160
as she drove her car
into the driveway.

42:48.243 --> 42:52.369
She was taken into the backyard
of her neighbor's house,

42:52.452 --> 42:57.494
and there were strips of cloth
already laid out for ligatures.

42:57.577 --> 42:59.535
Her ankles were tied with cord.

42:59.619 --> 43:01.452
She was blindfolded, gagged.

Jingling her car keys,

the EAR said
he'd be back in five minutes.

Car was reportedly
found in the area

locked in the trunk."

43:11.160 --> 43:12.744

The media became aware of it.

43:12.827 --> 43:15.118
The sheriff said,
"Please don't print anything,

43:15.202 --> 43:16.786
we're gonna catch this guy."

43:16.869 --> 43:19.911
And then as time went on
and we didn't catch the guy,

43:33.827 --> 43:36.243

on crime prevention.

43:36.327 --> 43:38.786
There were 500 people
in attendance.

You can use
a simple alarm system.

Mount a bell device
on the outside of your home.

43:43.827 --> 43:46.577
String some wires
to a power source

43:46.661 --> 43:49.243
and then string
the other set of wires

43:49.327 --> 43:52.535
right to a nightstand
and have a toggle switch there.

43:52.619 --> 43:54.619

the glass breaking,

43:54.702 --> 43:57.410

appears in the  Sacramento Bee.

44:16.619 --> 44:18.285
RICHARD: Warren Holloway
was a reporter.

44:18.369 --> 44:21.243
And I'd put a little
one-paragraph note
out to the detectives.

44:21.327 --> 44:23.869
"Got a rape series going
in the East Area."

44:23.993 --> 44:25.160
And he walked out, he saw that.

44:25.243 --> 44:27.661
The next day on the newspaper,
"East Area Rapist."

44:27.744 --> 44:29.827

in Rancho Cordova.

44:37.202 --> 44:41.619
Of the 35 that attended,
only one of those was a male.

LARRY: A lot of people
don't realize this,

44:56.202 --> 44:59.869

44:59.952 --> 45:01.369
out of the first ten,

45:02.786 --> 45:04.786
six of them were teenagers.

after it happened.

45:37.118 --> 45:39.035
It was December 18th.

45:39.118 --> 45:42.744
There was a high school dance,
and I had a cold.

45:42.827 --> 45:46.702
So at the last minute,
I decided to stay at home.

45:46.786 --> 45:49.661
Uh, my parents were going
to a Christmas party

45:49.744 --> 45:51.535

45:52.702 --> 45:55.577
My parents left
probably around 6:30-ish.

45:55.661 --> 45:58.369
And I think
I put a pizza in the oven,

45:58.452 --> 46:00.535
I remember
having my slippers on,

46:00.619 --> 46:02.827
and I decided
to go play the piano.

46:10.118 --> 46:15.160
I heard a noise,
but at 15 years old,

46:15.243 --> 46:16.661
you always hear noises
in your house

46:16.744 --> 46:17.993
when your parents aren't home.

46:18.077 --> 46:20.202

I do remember stopping
and listening and...

46:27.827 --> 46:30.911
uh, didn't hear anything else,

46:34.827 --> 46:37.535
It wasn't very much longer,
maybe a couple minutes,

46:37.619 --> 46:39.369
that I felt...

46:41.285 --> 46:45.118
um, a presence next to me.

46:45.202 --> 46:47.911
And I looked up and, um,

46:48.869 --> 46:50.869
then I felt a knife
at my throat.

46:58.035 --> 47:00.619
And then he told me in my ear,
you know,

47:00.702 --> 47:02.952
"If you scream or move,

47:03.035 --> 47:05.452
I will put this knife
through your throat

47:05.535 --> 47:07.243
and I'll be gone in the dark."

47:12.160 --> 47:15.702
He moved me down the hallway,
through the garage,

47:15.786 --> 47:18.369
and into the backyard,
um...

47:21.702 --> 47:24.869

into the house.

47:29.285 --> 47:32.410
And he told me he'd be
watching me every 10 seconds.

47:37.202 --> 47:40.035
He, uh, came back outside

47:40.118 --> 47:42.744

he cut my clothes off.

48:25.786 --> 48:28.911
And, uh--
but what I do remember

48:28.993 --> 48:34.535
is he had moved the couch
very close to our fireplace.

48:34.619 --> 48:38.786
But because I was blindfolded
and couldn't see,

48:38.869 --> 48:43.202
I thought he had caught
our couch on fire.

49:39.369 --> 49:41.993
forced his way in using a knife
