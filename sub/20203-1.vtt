WEBVTT

00:05.306 --> 00:06.608
* Ah, look at me get down *

00:06.674 --> 00:07.842
* Whoo, check him out *

00:07.909 --> 00:09.143
* Boy, I'm steppin' *

00:09.210 --> 00:10.945
* All right *

00:11.012 --> 00:12.246
* What you talkin' about? *

00:12.313 --> 00:13.581
* Yeeoww *

00:21.656 --> 00:23.090
That's me...

00:23.157 --> 00:25.026
Hugh Hefner.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.763
* Are you ready *

00:28.830 --> 00:32.099
I took a personal
investment of $600...

00:32.166 --> 00:34.536
and turned it
into a global empire.

00:36.103 --> 00:38.172
* Are you ready *

00:38.239 --> 00:40.542
You may
think you know me...

00:40.608 --> 00:42.777
the guy who has it all.

00:42.844 --> 00:44.345
Would you welcome
Hugh Hefner.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.649
* Get on down *

00:47.715 --> 00:48.883
The lavish mansion.

00:48.950 --> 00:50.184
* Look at me get down *

00:50.251 --> 00:51.853
* Whoo, check him out *

00:53.821 --> 00:57.024
The legendary parties.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.260
He would invite all
these beautiful girls.

00:59.326 --> 01:02.029
I mean, you talk about, like,
dying and going to heaven.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.031
It was amazing.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.903
And, of course, the women.

01:10.472 --> 01:12.239
Can you estimate

01:12.306 --> 01:14.842
just how many ladies
you have known?

01:14.909 --> 01:16.478
No, I can't.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.879
* Yeeoww *

01:17.945 --> 01:19.447
And what started it all...

01:19.514 --> 01:21.683
Playboy magazine.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.853
But for everything
you've heard about me,

01:25.920 --> 01:29.557
there's probably a lot
you don't know.

01:29.624 --> 01:31.358
For all the people
who loved me,

01:31.425 --> 01:34.729
there were plenty
who wanted to take me down.

01:34.796 --> 01:38.099
Playboy openly
advocates the overthrow

01:38.165 --> 01:40.768
of Judeo Christian
standards.

01:40.835 --> 01:44.305
There were times
when I felt worn down,

01:44.371 --> 01:45.973
trying to escape.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.175
You know, you pick yourself up
and you fight it again.

01:48.242 --> 01:53.147
I've been investigated
by the FBI and the DEA.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.082
Hefner said that
prosecutors kept pressuring

01:55.149 --> 01:58.252
Miss Arnstein to testify
against her boss in drug cases.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.255
Attacked by the media
and religious groups.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.157
Well, with this I think
that you'll agree,

02:03.224 --> 02:04.592
it's a sniggering
kind of sex.

02:04.659 --> 02:06.928
It certainly isn't
a healthy approach to sex.

02:06.994 --> 02:09.597
And pushed
to the brink of bankruptcy.

02:09.664 --> 02:13.367
Hef, you are
killing yourself.

02:13.434 --> 02:17.404
But my magazine
wasn't just about naked women.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.373
It was breaking down barriers,

02:19.440 --> 02:23.044
starting a cultural
conversation about sexuality,

02:23.110 --> 02:26.247
and standing up
for social justice.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.016
Hugh Hefner
identified unequivocally

02:29.083 --> 02:30.818
with the civil rights movement
of that time.

02:30.885 --> 02:35.222
Giving a platform to Dr. King,
a platform to Malcolm X.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.324
By any means
necessary.

02:37.391 --> 02:40.494
I've been
called a pornographer...

02:40.562 --> 02:42.029
a smut peddler...

02:42.096 --> 02:43.197
and a sexist.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.232
The day that you are
willing to come out here

02:45.299 --> 02:48.035
with a cottontail attached
to your rear end...

02:50.705 --> 02:53.675
And my lifestyle
hasn't always been easy

02:53.741 --> 02:55.610
on the people closest to me.

02:55.677 --> 02:59.180
He dates other girls,
and... I don't like it.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.548
And he knows
I don't like it.

03:01.883 --> 03:03.651
I've gained enemies...

03:03.718 --> 03:05.486
and lost friends.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.489
An already
emotionally troubled woman

03:08.556 --> 03:11.559
was pushed
beyond endurance...

03:11.626 --> 03:13.695
and she killed herself.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.032
The conception of Playboy

03:18.099 --> 03:22.637
came from my dad's irritation
with the status quo.

03:22.704 --> 03:25.640
So, the entire magazine
came to be

03:25.707 --> 03:28.442
because of one guy
who was pretty upset

03:28.509 --> 03:32.313
with how most people
interpreted and defined sex.

03:34.148 --> 03:36.951
I've lived a life
most could only dream of.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.957
This is my story.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.063
Or at least
how I remember it.

03:50.698 --> 03:54.401
* Every little movement *

03:54.468 --> 03:58.773
* Every little thing
you do *

03:58.840 --> 04:01.242
* Is it sleight of hand *

04:01.308 --> 04:06.447
* That commands
my heart to love you *

04:06.513 --> 04:10.484
* Every little movement *

04:10.551 --> 04:14.121
* Every little movement **

04:34.108 --> 04:35.042
Hef?

04:35.109 --> 04:36.043
Oh! Bobbie.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.812
- Hef!
- What is it?

04:37.879 --> 04:39.947
The cops
are downstairs.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.383
Just tell them
I'll deal with it tomorrow.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.051
They're here for you.

04:45.887 --> 04:48.189
This morning a man
is on trial in Chicago,

04:48.255 --> 04:51.292
charged with violating that
city's laws against obscenity.

04:53.594 --> 04:57.531
He's Hugh Hefner, publisher
of Playboy magazine.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.767
The issue has been the cause
of many court cases

04:59.834 --> 05:02.169
involving motion pictures,
books, and magazines,

05:02.236 --> 05:04.638
and various
court decisions have left

05:04.706 --> 05:06.140
considerable gray areas

05:06.207 --> 05:08.710
in determining just what
is salacious and obscene.

05:11.612 --> 05:16.984
Men who would
stand by and see their women

05:17.051 --> 05:20.121
degraded and debased,
as they are with the breast

05:20.187 --> 05:23.357
and the buttock
presentation by Playboy,

05:23.424 --> 05:26.160
are not men at all.

05:26.227 --> 05:28.362
What you're
accusing me of, in essence,

05:28.429 --> 05:30.264
is taking things
that previously were taboo

05:30.331 --> 05:32.599
and considered obscene
and objectionable

05:32.666 --> 05:34.969
and making them tasteful
and acceptable.

05:35.036 --> 05:36.637
Tonight,
the first of three

05:36.704 --> 05:38.239
special reports
on the controversy.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.307
The only thing
wrong with sex is the fact

05:40.374 --> 05:43.310
that we have a great tendency
to treat it as something

05:43.377 --> 05:46.447
shameful and guilty
and taboo-ridden,

05:46.513 --> 05:47.782
and this is what causes

05:47.849 --> 05:49.350
the major problems,
not the sex itself.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.361
Mr. Hefner...

06:00.427 --> 06:02.730
why did you start Playboy?

06:04.698 --> 06:07.001
Well...

06:07.068 --> 06:08.702
that's
a tough question.

06:08.770 --> 06:10.671
Just take your time.

06:14.241 --> 06:18.579
* I'll never smile again *

06:18.645 --> 06:21.615
Long before
the mansions, before the clubs,

06:21.682 --> 06:25.753
the parties, before the women,
before the magazine...

06:25.820 --> 06:27.755
there was just me.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.257
Hugh Marston Hefner.

06:30.324 --> 06:33.494
I was born
in Chicago in 1926.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.464
My parents were hardworking
Midwestern protestants

06:37.531 --> 06:38.933
who didn't allow dancing,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.203
drinking, or swearing
in the house.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.506
My father spent most
of his time at the office...

06:45.572 --> 06:48.509
and my mother was
emotionally distant toward me

06:48.575 --> 06:51.078
and my younger brother, Keith.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.414
I think that the major thing
that I missed,

06:53.480 --> 06:57.618
and that my parents missed
in their own childhood...

06:57.684 --> 07:01.655
because it's been passed from
generation to generation...

07:01.722 --> 07:03.958
was the inability
to show love

07:04.025 --> 07:07.328
in an emotional
and physical way.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.596
No hugging.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.398
No show
of any kind of emotion.

07:11.465 --> 07:15.569
With my home life
lacking the affection I craved,

07:15.636 --> 07:18.539
I escaped into
a world of fantasy.

07:20.507 --> 07:23.110
And for me,
that was cartooning.

07:25.146 --> 07:27.581
As a young man,
he was quite shy,

07:27.648 --> 07:32.119
and so he created his fantasy
life by writing stories

07:32.186 --> 07:33.888
and by cartooning his life...

07:35.256 --> 07:37.925
...where he could
live out the kind of life

07:37.992 --> 07:41.963
that he really wanted,
that he fantasized about.

07:42.029 --> 07:46.133
This was a way of compensating
for that shyness,

07:46.200 --> 07:49.470
and it has continued on
through his whole life.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.472
By the time I
reached high school,

07:51.538 --> 07:55.877
I'd even created an alter ego
named Goo Heffer...

07:55.943 --> 07:58.579
who was confident and popular.

08:00.381 --> 08:02.049
But when I wanted
to imagine a life

08:02.116 --> 08:05.052
far more exciting
than my own,

08:05.119 --> 08:08.289
there was only one place to go.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.502
When I was in my teens,

08:21.568 --> 08:25.172
I got a job at the local
movie theater.

08:25.239 --> 08:28.342
I was taken to movies
when I was very young,

08:28.409 --> 08:32.446
and from very early on,
up on that screen,

08:32.513 --> 08:36.350
were all the dreams
of the possibilities.

08:36.417 --> 08:38.019
You'd come out of that movie
and you'd feel like

08:38.085 --> 08:40.821
you were Bogart
or the leading man.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.357
The heroine loved you
in a very pure way,

08:43.424 --> 08:46.060
and I think that was what I
was really looking for.

08:47.828 --> 08:51.632
The heroine
I wanted in my life...

08:51.698 --> 08:55.069
was Betty Conklin.

08:55.136 --> 08:58.039
Everyone who's ever
been a teenager

08:58.105 --> 09:00.441
has known
a Betty Conklin.

09:01.943 --> 09:04.045
I was just
overwhelmed by her.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.080
There was a brief period
of time in which I thought

09:06.147 --> 09:10.084
it might really be, you know,
a romantic relationship.

09:10.151 --> 09:14.288
She picked my buddy
instead of me,

09:14.355 --> 09:18.659
and that told me more
than I wanted to know.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.629
And that was the period
when I reinvented myself.

09:25.532 --> 09:28.169
* Let your tear fall, baby *

09:28.235 --> 09:30.037
Over the next few years,

09:30.104 --> 09:32.239
I was determined
to transform myself

09:32.306 --> 09:34.875
into the leading man
I'd seen on screen.

09:34.942 --> 09:39.680
So I turned to my favorite
magazine for help... Esquire.

09:41.515 --> 09:44.685
Esquire was the first
men's magazine.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.853
It was the only magazine
that sort of went after

09:46.920 --> 09:48.322
the general interests of men.

09:48.389 --> 09:51.125
The reason there weren't
more magazines for men

09:51.192 --> 09:52.859
is because magazines,

09:52.926 --> 09:56.230
and to a slightly
lesser extent, reading,

09:56.297 --> 09:58.532
was seen as like a pursuit
that women did.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.535
And it was kinda revolutionary
to create a magazine for men

10:01.602 --> 10:03.070
and that it would
be successful,

10:03.137 --> 10:05.872
and it was successful
pretty rapidly.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.109
I had just
discovered Esquire

10:08.175 --> 10:09.676
for the very first time,

10:09.743 --> 10:12.513
and the world
suggested by Esquire.

10:12.579 --> 10:17.218
The cartoons, the fiction,
the fashion,

10:17.284 --> 10:20.754
and certainly the pin-ups,
which were called Petty Girls.

10:20.821 --> 10:24.225
The Petty Girls became
my first favorite pin-up.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.028
And I covered my walls with them
when I was first in high school.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.130
* Let your tear fall, baby *

10:29.196 --> 10:30.564
Esquire just opened my eyes

10:30.631 --> 10:33.800
to a whole other world
that was only hinted at

10:33.867 --> 10:37.404
in the movies of the time.

10:37.471 --> 10:41.708
Reading Esquire changed
my whole approach to life.

10:41.775 --> 10:45.279
I was more confident
and outgoing.

10:45.346 --> 10:51.052
* If you said good-bye **

10:52.719 --> 10:54.821
And,
by the end of high school,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.823
I met someone.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.326
Her name was Millie Williams.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.995
* I've got a girl
that lives up on a hill *

11:02.063 --> 11:04.831
I felt an instant
connection with Millie.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.101
She got my sense of humor,

11:07.168 --> 11:09.370
liked the way I dressed.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.672
But most importantly...

11:11.738 --> 11:13.740
she understood me.

11:13.807 --> 11:17.311
I met Hef at a graduation party,
the week of graduation.

11:17.378 --> 11:21.215
He made me feel very important
and that he liked me a lot.

11:21.282 --> 11:23.184
And he was fun to be with.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.018
I really think that Millie

11:25.086 --> 11:28.021
was the first girl
that he really loved,

11:28.089 --> 11:31.225
rather than just being
in love with from afar.

11:31.292 --> 11:34.628
That he really loved,
who loved him back.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.030
We started
getting serious,

11:37.098 --> 11:38.465
and when Millie
registered for college

11:38.532 --> 11:41.268
at the University
of Illinois...

11:41.335 --> 11:42.903
I decided to follow her.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.471
* Hey, man, I'm happy *

11:44.538 --> 11:47.641
* I am happy as a baby boy *

11:47.708 --> 11:50.511
But, like
most couples of the day,

11:50.577 --> 11:54.648
our private life
was pretty innocent.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.118
Everyone, I think,
had the same routine,

11:57.184 --> 11:59.520
in which sexually
you did many things,

11:59.586 --> 12:01.255
but you didn't
do the thing.

12:01.322 --> 12:04.358
And this was very typical,
and somehow that kept you,

12:04.425 --> 12:06.593
you know,
God wasn't frowning.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.229
* Little woman I'm through *

12:12.399 --> 12:15.202
My college life
was fairly typical

12:15.269 --> 12:17.904
for the first few semesters.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.407
But in my junior year,

12:20.474 --> 12:22.943
everything changed...

12:23.009 --> 12:26.813
when a groundbreaking
psychological study came out...

12:26.880 --> 12:28.249
that would open my eyes

12:28.315 --> 12:30.684
to a completely
different side of life.

12:35.656 --> 12:39.660
In 1948,
sexologist Alfred Kinsey

12:39.726 --> 12:44.465
published a massive study
of American male sexuality.

12:44.531 --> 12:49.503
In this study, he showed
that American men and women

12:49.570 --> 12:51.372
had a lot more
sexual experience

12:51.438 --> 12:53.407
than most people
were willing to admit to.

12:53.474 --> 12:57.411
Affairs, same-sex experiences,
multiple partners.

12:57.478 --> 13:00.847
And it made news
all across the country.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.518
You have to remember,

13:04.585 --> 13:08.422
back in the '40s, no one
was talking about sex.

13:08.489 --> 13:10.424
In Hollywood pictures,
a man and a woman

13:10.491 --> 13:13.026
weren't allowed to be
shown in bed together...

13:13.093 --> 13:14.561
not even married couples.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.863
That attitude was reflected

13:16.930 --> 13:19.200
in books
and other mass media.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.067
There was a kind of a...

13:21.134 --> 13:24.137
Norman Rockwell
view of the world

13:24.205 --> 13:26.307
that didn't exist,

13:26.373 --> 13:28.809
and it bothered me
very much.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.381
* I was standing
on the corner *

13:34.448 --> 13:36.149
* When I heard
my bulldog bark *

13:36.217 --> 13:39.052
Kinsey's expose
of the hypocrisy in our country

13:39.119 --> 13:41.722
was a revelation to me...

13:41.788 --> 13:46.260
and I was inspired to start
voicing my own opinion.

13:46.327 --> 13:48.262
We've got it down
to these six.

13:48.329 --> 13:51.298
I became editor of
the college humor magazine...

13:51.365 --> 13:52.666
called Shaft.

13:52.733 --> 13:53.834
This one.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.270
And, taking a lead
from Kinsey...

13:56.337 --> 13:59.340
I used it as a sounding board
for my own sexual beliefs.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.842
* Stagger Lee told Billy *

14:01.908 --> 14:03.644
Shaft magazine had an editorial

14:03.710 --> 14:08.081
about the Kinsey report
and about sexual repression

14:08.148 --> 14:10.751
and the hurt
and hypocrisy of it.

14:10.817 --> 14:14.020
I wrote a great deal
about the really moral issues.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.556
That what we call moral,

14:15.622 --> 14:17.391
in every other area
of human activity,

14:17.458 --> 14:19.159
is what is good
for people.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.962
And our traditional values
related to sex

14:22.028 --> 14:23.364
are not good for people.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.432
They hurt people.
They're hypocritical.

14:25.499 --> 14:26.867
* Go, Stagger Lee *

14:26.933 --> 14:30.003
I started
drawing racy cartoons,

14:30.070 --> 14:32.138
writing essays about sex,

14:32.205 --> 14:33.840
and challenging conformity.

14:33.907 --> 14:37.578
I think what my father taught me
about freedom of expression...

14:37.644 --> 14:41.315
is that it's okay to not be PC

14:41.382 --> 14:42.583
when you're having
a conversation

14:42.649 --> 14:44.451
about something
that really matters.

14:44.518 --> 14:47.521
It's okay to challenge
other people's beliefs

14:47.588 --> 14:48.989
and your own beliefs.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.292
I also
introduced a feature

14:51.358 --> 14:53.394
that was an instant hit
on campus.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.696
* Stagger Lee and Billy *

14:55.762 --> 14:58.699
When Hef was working
on Shaft magazine,

14:58.765 --> 15:01.201
he started Coed of the Month.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.903
And it would be a girl,

15:02.969 --> 15:05.071
and it would have
career information

15:05.138 --> 15:06.473
and her statistics

15:06.540 --> 15:08.609
and what she was into
and what she liked.

15:08.675 --> 15:13.246
So he already had
that idea pre- Playboy.

15:14.681 --> 15:15.882
I loved
the creative freedom

15:15.949 --> 15:19.052
that writing for Shaft
offered me.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.687
* Now, look out, Stagger, go *

15:20.754 --> 15:22.956
And the best part was

15:23.023 --> 15:26.760
I could use my cartoons to send
hidden messages to Millie.

15:29.463 --> 15:31.532
As he was talking
about these laws,

15:31.598 --> 15:34.200
these restrictive laws
and repressive things,

15:34.267 --> 15:36.937
it was very easy
to discuss this together

15:37.003 --> 15:39.540
and say how wrong this
all was, because we both,

15:39.606 --> 15:41.975
we felt the same way,
despite my Catholic background

15:42.042 --> 15:43.510
and his background.

15:43.577 --> 15:48.048
And um, we found we had
a lot of the same attitudes.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.517
Our shared views
brought us closer...

15:50.584 --> 15:54.220
both emotionally
and physically.

15:54.287 --> 15:59.460
My romance with Millie, then,
was an extended, uh, foreplay

15:59.526 --> 16:02.028
until she graduated
from college.

16:02.095 --> 16:05.799
We had sex for the first time
the summer of '48.

16:05.866 --> 16:07.300
I would've been 22.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.509
A few months
after graduation...

16:15.576 --> 16:19.546
I did what everyone else
did in those days.

16:19.613 --> 16:22.483
I proposed
to my college sweetheart.

16:28.389 --> 16:30.524
And we should be able
to trust one another.

16:30.591 --> 16:31.925
Don't smile it away...

16:31.992 --> 16:33.460
But then one night...

16:33.527 --> 16:35.362
Millie dropped a bombshell.

16:35.429 --> 16:36.997
You were in love with
a schoolgirl notion

16:37.063 --> 16:38.198
of a popular novelist!

16:38.264 --> 16:39.566
Millie.

16:42.903 --> 16:45.071
Millie!

16:45.138 --> 16:46.239
What was that about?

16:46.306 --> 16:48.341
I just want
to go home.

16:48.409 --> 16:49.810
Everything okay?

16:49.876 --> 16:51.378
That night...

16:51.445 --> 16:54.347
Millie told me
she had an affair.

16:55.516 --> 16:57.818
Can we please
go home?

16:57.884 --> 17:01.354
I was completely blindsided.

17:01.422 --> 17:05.726
* You told me *

17:05.792 --> 17:08.228
* That you would leave me *

17:08.294 --> 17:10.130
* Here in tears *

17:12.866 --> 17:16.403
* Now you're gone
and hours seem like years *

17:16.470 --> 17:19.473
Nothing in my life had
prepared me for that moment.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.809
I was just
absolutely devastated.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.546
It may be difficult
to imagine,

17:25.612 --> 17:30.250
related to the publisher
of Playboy magazine.

17:30.316 --> 17:34.588
But I had been intimate with
only one woman in my life,

17:34.655 --> 17:36.757
the woman I was gonna marry.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.426
How I dealt with it,
I don't really know.

17:39.493 --> 17:42.262
I just dealt with it by,
I think somehow,

17:42.328 --> 17:43.864
putting it out of my mind.

17:43.930 --> 17:47.501
* Where did you go *

17:47.568 --> 17:50.937
This was,
after all, the 1950s.

17:51.004 --> 17:55.542
And back then, you married
the girl you were in love with,

17:55.609 --> 17:57.844
no matter what.

17:57.911 --> 18:02.516
And, truth be told, I was
still in love with Millie.

18:02.583 --> 18:05.018
* Johnny *

18:05.085 --> 18:06.953
* Johnny, you're too young *

18:07.020 --> 18:09.456
* But I'm gonna
get married *

18:09.523 --> 18:11.191
* You're so young *

18:11.257 --> 18:13.927
* My name she'll carry *

18:13.994 --> 18:16.497
Our wedding
was in the summer of '49.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.164
* Johnny, you're so smart *

18:18.231 --> 18:22.302
We had our
whole lives ahead of us.

18:22.368 --> 18:25.138
And in January of 1951...

18:25.205 --> 18:26.239
That's great news.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.742
...I landed my dream job.

18:28.809 --> 18:31.211
I'd just be writing copy
in the ad department,

18:31.277 --> 18:34.014
but I'd be working for
my favorite magazine...

18:34.080 --> 18:35.516
* It sets my soul on fire *

18:35.582 --> 18:37.984
...Esquire.

18:38.051 --> 18:40.086
* How come every time
she leave me *

18:40.153 --> 18:42.856
This was my chance to do
something creative.

18:42.923 --> 18:45.692
* ...too young to marry *

18:45.759 --> 18:48.729
* But not to hide
an aching heart *

18:52.699 --> 18:54.568
But I quickly realized

18:54.635 --> 18:57.804
it wasn't what I'd imagined.

18:57.871 --> 18:59.740
Esquire had changed.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.844
The 1950's was kind of
a down period for Esquire.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.612
I think they were
probably reeling

19:05.679 --> 19:07.681
from the end of World War II

19:07.748 --> 19:10.216
and the beginnings
of a more repressive society

19:10.283 --> 19:12.485
and probably tended toward being
a little more conservative.

19:12.553 --> 19:15.121
They'd moved away
from all the things

19:15.188 --> 19:17.524
I'd been drawn to
growing up.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.126
The full-page cartoons,
the jokes,

19:20.193 --> 19:22.829
and most of all,
the pin-up girls.

19:25.131 --> 19:28.769
The job turned out to be
a huge disappointment.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.571
And when they
refused my request

19:30.637 --> 19:34.007
for a five dollar raise...

19:34.074 --> 19:35.175
I quit.

19:37.644 --> 19:41.481
But everything changed
in 1952...

19:41.548 --> 19:42.983
* You couldn't be cuter *

19:43.049 --> 19:44.585
...when Millie gave birth

19:44.651 --> 19:46.086
to our first child.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.788
* Plus that
intelligent face *

19:47.854 --> 19:50.390
We named her Christie.

19:50.456 --> 19:53.226
* ...charm for me *

19:53.293 --> 19:55.395
And while I loved
being a father...

19:55.461 --> 19:57.998
suddenly, I had a family
to provide for.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.933
* You are the little
grand slam *

20:00.000 --> 20:02.903
* I'll bring to my family *

20:02.969 --> 20:06.172
And I needed to find a job...

20:07.808 --> 20:10.877
...any job...
as quickly as possible.

20:21.221 --> 20:25.391
So I took a low-level position
at a publishing house...

20:25.458 --> 20:29.129
crunching numbers
and trying to improve sales.

20:29.195 --> 20:33.834
But the job was about
as mind-numbing as it gets.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.876
And, as time went on...

20:44.177 --> 20:47.948
I realized I'd become
just one of the masses.

20:50.083 --> 20:54.988
The 1950's was a time
of conformity.

20:55.055 --> 20:58.091
The course was set out...
you went to school,

20:58.158 --> 21:00.060
you got married,
you had children,

21:00.126 --> 21:04.765
you got the best job you could
to support your family.

21:04.831 --> 21:08.702
There was not a lot of room
for individuality,

21:08.769 --> 21:12.238
and that did not
appeal to Hef at all.

21:30.323 --> 21:33.259
I only went into that bar
to be alone.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.965
* Just one look *

21:39.032 --> 21:43.737
* And I fell so hard *

21:43.804 --> 21:45.672
And I certainly
wasn't expecting

21:45.739 --> 21:47.140
what happened next.

21:48.909 --> 21:51.544
* With you *

21:51.611 --> 21:53.947
* Oh oh, oh oh *

21:54.014 --> 21:56.683
* I found out *

21:56.750 --> 22:02.188
* How good it feels *

22:02.255 --> 22:03.890
* To have... *

22:03.957 --> 22:06.192
I knew what I was doing
was wrong...

22:06.259 --> 22:11.898
but for the first time
in a long time, I felt alive.

22:28.514 --> 22:32.753
The affair ended
as quickly as it started.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.821
But it sparked
something in me.

22:38.258 --> 22:41.527
I'd always been happiest
being creative,

22:41.594 --> 22:45.098
and as I looked back on
my cartoons, short stories,

22:45.165 --> 22:48.068
and articles
from Shaft magazine,

22:48.134 --> 22:50.636
I saw what I was missing.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.438
I became convinced very early

22:52.505 --> 22:55.475
that older people
became cynical

22:55.541 --> 22:57.744
and somehow
sold out those dreams.

22:57.811 --> 23:00.146
And that's what
I was unwilling to do.

23:00.213 --> 23:02.749
I was not willing
to make that tradeoff,

23:02.816 --> 23:06.619
to get in line
and lock step march away

23:06.686 --> 23:08.922
the rest of my life.

23:08.989 --> 23:11.691
My father was still
trying to find himself,

23:11.758 --> 23:13.259
and had a number of jobs

23:13.326 --> 23:15.361
that I think were
less than satisfying.

23:15.428 --> 23:19.966
He was always, I think, drawn
to both visual expression

23:20.033 --> 23:23.503
and also to big ideas.

23:25.371 --> 23:28.008
It was then that
I made a decision

23:28.074 --> 23:31.411
that would change the course
of my life forever.

23:40.020 --> 23:43.990
I decided to create
a magazine of my own.

23:48.228 --> 23:51.397
One that would appeal
to guys like me...

23:51.464 --> 23:56.102
featuring articles about music,
literature, art, and culture.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.940
When he started the magazine,

24:00.006 --> 24:03.676
he actually created
the magazine for himself.

24:03.743 --> 24:06.046
There was no magazine
out there

24:06.112 --> 24:10.917
that he found
of interest for a young guy.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.854
Most of the men's magazines

24:13.920 --> 24:16.489
were hunting and fishing
magazines,

24:16.556 --> 24:21.895
gun magazines,
not sophisticated magazines.

24:21.962 --> 24:23.329
The only
sophisticated magazine

24:23.396 --> 24:26.366
that was out there
at the time was Esquire.

24:28.935 --> 24:32.772
It was going to be, uh,
what Esquire used to be.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.074
And it was a magazine

24:34.140 --> 24:36.376
that would really be
for the young urban male.

24:36.442 --> 24:42.082
But my magazine
would be so much more.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.217
In the same way
that Kinsey blew the cover

24:44.284 --> 24:47.120
off sexuality in America...

24:47.187 --> 24:48.955
I wanted my magazine

24:49.022 --> 24:52.758
to confront
the topic of sex head on.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.395
For Hef, I think
the message about sex

24:55.461 --> 24:58.364
has always been
that it's healthy.

24:58.431 --> 25:00.200
And natural.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.202
And, that we shouldn't
be ashamed of it.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.404
And we should embrace it.

25:04.470 --> 25:08.141
That was not the popular
opinion in the 1950s.

25:08.208 --> 25:09.742
And it's hard to remember now,

25:09.809 --> 25:14.247
when you look back, that this
was fairly revolutionary.

25:19.785 --> 25:22.923
It was one thing
to talk about sex,

25:22.989 --> 25:25.291
but I wanted to do more

25:28.761 --> 25:31.764
Growing up, my favorite
parts of Esquire

25:31.831 --> 25:34.400
were those drawings
of the pin-up girls.

25:36.702 --> 25:40.506
But I thought my magazine
could go one step further...

25:40.573 --> 25:43.509
by showing photos
of nude women.

25:43.576 --> 25:46.146
I think the brilliance
of the magazine was

25:46.212 --> 25:49.049
it spoke to all the interests
of young men.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.118
So those were
cultural and political.

25:52.185 --> 25:54.720
It was fashion,
it was travel.

25:54.787 --> 25:58.925
But it also was an unabashed
recognition of the interest

25:58.992 --> 26:02.262
that young men had
in beautiful women.

26:02.328 --> 26:05.665
I knew that there
would be nothing that was

26:05.731 --> 26:07.968
outside,
uh, the boundaries

26:08.034 --> 26:10.203
of what was already
being published.

26:10.270 --> 26:12.138
In other words,
there were magazines,

26:12.205 --> 26:15.008
art photography magazines,
sunbathing magazines,

26:15.075 --> 26:17.143
with nudes in them.

26:17.210 --> 26:20.746
I wanted to package it
in a way that...

26:20.813 --> 26:23.984
suggested that this
was not art.

26:24.050 --> 26:28.188
It was... something
with an editorial message,

26:28.254 --> 26:30.623
and the editorial message
was that sex was okay.

26:34.995 --> 26:37.563
I was going to combine
a modern lifestyle magazine

26:37.630 --> 26:39.699
with nude photos
of women.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.038
And I had
the perfect name for it.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.011
Stag Party.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.881
What magazines do you read?

26:55.948 --> 26:58.518
Why?

26:58.584 --> 27:00.453
Just name some.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.721
I-- I don't know.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.589
I knew
I liked the idea...

27:03.656 --> 27:06.026
Now I just needed to see
if anyone else would, too.

27:06.092 --> 27:07.660
And the first guy
that I thought of

27:07.727 --> 27:10.330
was my old friend
Eldon Sellers.

27:10.396 --> 27:12.165
What if there
was a magazine

27:12.232 --> 27:15.401
that didn't fall
into any one category?

27:15.468 --> 27:16.936
That took all
your favorite things

27:17.003 --> 27:19.305
and put them
into one place.

27:19.372 --> 27:21.974
And it'll have
a full-page color photo

27:22.042 --> 27:24.077
of a real life
pin-up girl...

27:24.144 --> 27:27.113
completely nude.

27:31.884 --> 27:32.985
It's gonna be great,
Eldon.

27:33.053 --> 27:34.620
It sounds like it.

27:34.687 --> 27:36.922
It's going to be
a progressive magazine for men.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.959
He came to me and said that he
would like to have some help

27:40.026 --> 27:43.296
raising some money
for a magazine.

27:43.363 --> 27:47.100
He did a terrific job
of promoting the idea

27:47.167 --> 27:48.701
and explaining it,
and he was...

27:48.768 --> 27:50.936
he was extremely
articulate about that.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.238
I like that.

27:52.305 --> 27:54.140
Eldon liked it so much,

27:54.207 --> 27:56.509
he chipped in $2,000

27:56.576 --> 27:59.912
and even offered to help me
find more investors.

27:59.979 --> 28:03.416
And, honestly, I was going to
need all the help I could get.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.987
Just to give you a sense of how
much money I needed to raise,

28:08.054 --> 28:11.757
Time magazine was started
with an initial investment

28:11.824 --> 28:14.294
of $86,000.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.863
And that was all the way
back in 1923.

28:17.930 --> 28:22.735
Today, that's the equivalent
of over $1.2 million.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.537
Even when Playboy was started,

28:24.604 --> 28:28.074
it was unusual to have
that little capital

28:28.141 --> 28:31.244
and those few resources.

28:31.311 --> 28:34.647
Today, it would be almost
impossible to consider

28:34.714 --> 28:38.451
starting a magazine
without having millions
and millions of dollars

28:38.518 --> 28:42.122
and the capacity
to sustain losses for three,

28:42.188 --> 28:44.257
four, five, six years.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.696
* My man called me
this morning... *

28:50.763 --> 28:52.932
I figured
after Eldon's investment,

28:52.998 --> 28:56.001
I was still going to need
at least $6,000

28:56.068 --> 28:58.037
to get my idea off the ground.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.005
* Said hello, baby *

29:00.072 --> 29:03.743
So we started meeting
with investors in Chicago.

29:03.809 --> 29:05.645
What do you think?

29:05.711 --> 29:07.347
A lot of them said no.

29:07.413 --> 29:11.417
* My head went
round and round, yeah *

29:11.484 --> 29:14.554
But a few of them said yes.

29:14.620 --> 29:15.921
* My man called me
this morning *

29:15.988 --> 29:18.291
Hello, Fred?
Hugh Hefner here.

29:18.358 --> 29:20.460
Well, I'm happy
you asked.

29:20.526 --> 29:21.794
Okay...

29:21.861 --> 29:23.363
I was hoping for
slightly better than that,

29:23.429 --> 29:25.165
to be honest with you.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.567
Okay...
that sounds great.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.135
No matter what,

29:29.202 --> 29:31.637
I was going
to make this happen.

29:31.704 --> 29:33.873
And, after weeks
of calling...

29:33.939 --> 29:36.409
we got my younger brother,
Keith,

29:36.476 --> 29:38.944
and my neighbors
to pitch in.

29:39.011 --> 29:42.948
Even my puritanical mother
gave me $1,000.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.485
I never had a long conversation
with my grandmother

29:45.551 --> 29:47.287
about her investment
in the magazine,

29:47.353 --> 29:49.689
but, knowing her as I did,

29:49.755 --> 29:52.024
I would say that...
she would have said

29:52.091 --> 29:54.560
it was not a magazine for her,

29:54.627 --> 29:56.596
but that she
believed in her son.

29:56.662 --> 29:59.165
But even
with my family and friends

29:59.232 --> 30:00.766
pitching in,

30:00.833 --> 30:03.503
I was still
about $600 short.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.171
So, out of desperation,

30:05.238 --> 30:08.608
I put my furniture in hock.

30:08.674 --> 30:10.643
It included some pretty nice
pieces by designers

30:10.710 --> 30:13.213
like Herman Miller and Eames.

30:13.279 --> 30:16.516
* My man called me
this morning, stop **

30:16.582 --> 30:19.419
And finally,
I hit my goal.

30:27.327 --> 30:29.595
With the money
finally in place,

30:29.662 --> 30:32.398
I was ready to start
making my magazine.

30:34.467 --> 30:36.436
But I quickly realized

30:36.502 --> 30:38.838
I couldn't do this
on my own.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.177
So... what
did Frank tell you?

30:45.245 --> 30:46.679
Well, not much.

30:46.746 --> 30:48.681
Just that you're...
you're starting a magazine,

30:48.748 --> 30:50.483
and you might be looking
for an art director.

30:50.550 --> 30:52.585
Well it's not just
any magazine.

30:52.652 --> 30:56.021
It's a lifestyle magazine
with a full-color

30:56.088 --> 30:59.325
nude spread
of a girl in each issue.

30:59.392 --> 31:01.727
But I want this magazine
to be more than that.

31:01.794 --> 31:05.398
A look that nobody
has ever seen before.

31:05.465 --> 31:09.302
I want this magazine
to be beautiful.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.704
You want to do a magazine
with nude girls,

31:11.771 --> 31:14.039
and you want the magazine
to be beautiful?

31:16.276 --> 31:17.777
That's right.

31:19.512 --> 31:22.648
I had my art director...

31:22.715 --> 31:24.216
a popular graphic designer

31:24.284 --> 31:26.919
from the Southside
of Chicago...

31:26.986 --> 31:28.654
named Art Paul.

31:33.493 --> 31:36.996
Art Paul was ahead of his time.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.901
His designs were modern

31:41.967 --> 31:45.505
and different from Esquire, and
that's what Hef was looking for.

31:45.571 --> 31:49.575
And Hef has a knack
for finding that talent.

31:54.079 --> 31:57.583
With Art Paul
on board, I had my team.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.519
I'd write the copy,

31:59.585 --> 32:02.388
Art would create the design...

32:02.455 --> 32:05.090
and Eldon would
handle promotions.

32:05.157 --> 32:08.928
My small apartment became
Stag Party's offices...

32:08.994 --> 32:11.664
and it was finally
time to get to work.

32:13.466 --> 32:15.000
Playboy was never

32:15.067 --> 32:16.469
a corporate magazine.

32:16.536 --> 32:18.203
It was never part of
a giant publishing house.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.874
You're talking about a magazine
that is as DIY as it gets.

32:21.941 --> 32:26.946
It's one man started it
at his kitchen table in Chicago.

32:27.012 --> 32:29.815
We came up
with countless ideas

32:29.882 --> 32:31.984
for how to make
the magazine stand out.

32:34.754 --> 32:40.526
At that time, 3-D movies
were hugely popular...

32:40.593 --> 32:44.697
so we considered featuring
our girls in 3-D.

32:44.764 --> 32:47.232
But attaching a pair
of glasses to every issue

32:47.299 --> 32:50.670
proved too expensive.

32:50.736 --> 32:55.007
In the end, we realized it
wasn't about the gimmick.

32:55.074 --> 32:58.911
We just needed to find
the perfect girl.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.814
* Hurry on down to my house,
baby, ain't anybody home... *

33:01.881 --> 33:03.449
In the 1950s,

33:03.516 --> 33:05.818
if you wanted
a nude photo of a model,

33:05.885 --> 33:09.389
and you didn't have
your own to photograph...

33:09.455 --> 33:11.691
the only places
you could get them from

33:11.757 --> 33:13.893
were calendar companies.

33:13.959 --> 33:16.328
And, for a price,
you could purchase

33:16.396 --> 33:17.797
the rights to their pin-ups.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.800
* Ain't nobody home
but me *

33:20.866 --> 33:24.069
We reached out
to countless calendar companies

33:24.136 --> 33:26.038
and gathered
hundreds of options

33:26.105 --> 33:27.640
for our first cover girl.

33:27.707 --> 33:30.976
* There's nobody home
but me **

33:31.043 --> 33:33.012
What about her, huh?

33:34.914 --> 33:36.449
No, she's not right.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.485
This one?

33:41.053 --> 33:42.622
No, no.

33:46.492 --> 33:48.027
Maybe if you
tell me exactly what

33:48.093 --> 33:49.562
you're looking for,
we can find the girl.

33:49.629 --> 33:51.063
Well,
that's the problem.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.533
We're not looking for a girl,
we're looking for the girl.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.100
What does that mean?

33:55.167 --> 33:57.169
We need to find a girl that
no guy would be able to resist.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.304
Someone who will
make it impossible

33:59.371 --> 34:01.173
for a guy not to open
the cover.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.508
Oh, well, if that's all...

34:02.575 --> 34:04.877
I don't know where she is,
but she's not here.

34:18.424 --> 34:22.061
I'd spent weeks
looking for a cover girl...

34:22.127 --> 34:24.464
and I was starting
to lose hope.

34:27.500 --> 34:30.202
But in the fall of 1953,

34:30.269 --> 34:33.806
the solution would
come out of nowhere.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.946
* I touch your lips
and all at once *

34:41.013 --> 34:43.415
* The sparks go flying *

34:43.483 --> 34:48.153
* Those devil that know
so well the art of lying *

34:48.220 --> 34:50.656
* And though I see
the danger still... *

34:50.723 --> 34:52.224
In those days,

34:52.291 --> 34:55.661
Marilyn Monroe was every man's
ultimate fantasy.

34:55.728 --> 34:58.030
* ...your kiss of fire *

34:58.097 --> 35:00.399
* Just like a torch
you set the soul... *

35:00.466 --> 35:02.902
She was the very
pinnacle of sexuality.

35:02.968 --> 35:05.905
* I must go on
along the road... *

35:05.971 --> 35:09.408
But years
before she was famous...

35:09.475 --> 35:12.978
when she was still known
as Norma Jean Baker...

35:13.045 --> 35:15.548
the young model had posed
nude for a calendar.

35:15.615 --> 35:17.917
* ...your kiss of fire *

35:21.921 --> 35:24.957
She was the hottest star
in Hollywood.

35:25.024 --> 35:27.259
I heard about, uh,

35:27.326 --> 35:29.595
the Marilyn Monroe
calendar picture,

35:29.662 --> 35:31.864
which everybody had heard about,
but nobody had seen

35:31.931 --> 35:34.667
because they were afraid
to show it back then.

35:34.734 --> 35:36.335
* I can't resist you... *

35:36.401 --> 35:39.639
But I knew I had to put it
in the magazine,

35:39.705 --> 35:43.275
because she was
the absolute perfect choice.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.945
Hef had a real
understanding of pop culture

35:46.011 --> 35:48.881
and the public's fascination
with celebrity.

35:48.948 --> 35:50.783
So that
Marilyn Monroe image,

35:50.850 --> 35:52.752
he knew that was
the golden ticket.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.821
That was thing that was going
to launch that magazine.

35:57.189 --> 36:00.526
* Yeah, oh **

36:02.027 --> 36:03.596
You have to remember,

36:03.663 --> 36:05.297
this was before the Internet,

36:05.364 --> 36:08.500
so getting access
to photos this rare

36:08.568 --> 36:10.536
was almost impossible.

36:10.603 --> 36:14.406
But now, I knew
who had the originals,

36:14.473 --> 36:17.109
and what's even crazier...

36:17.176 --> 36:20.546
was that he was
right here in Chicago.

36:23.082 --> 36:26.986
But I only had $1,000 left
in my budget.

36:27.052 --> 36:29.989
I just had to hope
that would be enough.

36:33.726 --> 36:36.028
Okay, uh, what
can I help you with?

36:36.095 --> 36:39.899
Well, I'm interested in
purchasing one of your photos.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.400
That's all?

36:43.168 --> 36:47.740
It's, uh, it's not just
any photo, Mr. Baumgarth.

36:47.807 --> 36:50.375
It's Marilyn.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.645
Look... people pay me
a lot of money

36:52.712 --> 36:55.214
just to look
at those pictures.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.916
Buying them
won't be cheap.

36:56.982 --> 37:00.452
Well, uh,
I only need one.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.588
But I have to have
full rights to print it.

37:03.889 --> 37:08.260
This is Marilyn Monroe
we're talking about.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.528
Uh, I couldn't
let you have it

37:09.595 --> 37:12.297
for any less than, uh...

37:12.364 --> 37:13.766
600.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.207
600?

37:22.274 --> 37:24.576
Yeah.

37:26.245 --> 37:27.312
That's a lot of money.

37:47.332 --> 37:49.301
Make it 500.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.539
Done.
But you pay me now.

37:54.606 --> 37:55.975
In cash.

37:56.041 --> 37:56.976
Agreed.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.119
* Don't you know *

38:07.186 --> 38:09.655
* Don't you know
I love you so *

38:13.025 --> 38:14.794
* Don't you know *

38:14.860 --> 38:17.329
* Don't you know
I love you so *

38:20.265 --> 38:21.901
There she is.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.737
* Why did you have to go *

38:31.210 --> 38:34.013
Marilyn
didn't disappoint.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.651
Apparently, the photographer
was so nervous,

38:39.719 --> 38:41.721
he forgot
to change the film...

38:41.787 --> 38:43.355
leaving some of the photos

38:43.422 --> 38:46.125
with two images overlaid
on top of each other.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.293
Thank you.

38:50.963 --> 38:52.765
I could hardly believe it.

38:52.832 --> 38:56.035
There I was, holding
what was probably

38:56.101 --> 38:59.238
the most valuable
photograph on the planet.

38:59.304 --> 39:02.007
* Don't you know
I love you so *

39:02.074 --> 39:04.576
After months of planning,

39:04.643 --> 39:09.114
I was ready to take
the world by storm.

39:12.584 --> 39:16.221
* Every little movement *

39:16.288 --> 39:20.726
* Every motion of your hips *

39:20.793 --> 39:25.064
* I feel the compulsion
to pull you *

39:25.130 --> 39:29.234
* To my sweet lips *

39:29.301 --> 39:33.172
* Is it a black magic spell *

39:33.238 --> 39:36.708
* You put me under *

39:36.776 --> 39:40.445
* This miracle moment *

39:40.512 --> 39:44.283
* Never let it end *

39:44.349 --> 39:48.553
* Every little movement *

39:48.620 --> 39:52.624
* Is beyond improvement *

39:52.691 --> 39:55.194
* You are the magician *

39:55.260 --> 40:00.265
* I've been wishing for
forever *

40:00.332 --> 40:04.336
* Every little movement *

40:04.403 --> 40:08.073
* Every little movement **
