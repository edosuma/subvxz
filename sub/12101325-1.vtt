- Shots! Shots!

02:23.984 --> 02:26.419
I'm not... I'm not saying
the president's a cyborg.

02:26.452 --> 02:28.088
But what I am saying

02:28.121 --> 02:31.557
is that there are two of them,
okay.

02:31.591 --> 02:34.962
The real one wears the red tie

02:34.995 --> 02:37.899
and the fake one
wears the blue tie.

02:37.932 --> 02:39.600
Where are you getting this?
Where are you getting this?

02:39.633 --> 02:43.670
Are you guys open to things?

02:43.704 --> 02:45.639
- I don't, um...
- Like an open...

02:45.672 --> 02:47.775
- Open... open.
- You can look it up

02:47.809 --> 02:48.776
on the Internet!

02:48.810 --> 02:51.179
The universe is shifting, okay?

02:51.212 --> 02:53.882
Mandela effect.

02:53.915 --> 02:56.550
The president?
The South African President?

02:56.583 --> 02:58.152
- What are you guys into?
- I just wanna know

02:58.186 --> 03:01.957
if this is like... are you
saying this for like me?

03:01.991 --> 03:04.492
Or like for him?

03:04.525 --> 03:06.061
'Cause that's where
I'm kind of like, eh.

03:06.095 --> 03:08.731
That's for me to know
not for you.

03:08.764 --> 03:10.465
The Monopoly guy does not
have a monocle.

03:10.498 --> 03:12.968
- The Monopoly totally...
- Does not have a monocle.

03:13.002 --> 03:15.004
- The peanut guy, I think.
- Yeah, the peanut guy

03:15.037 --> 03:17.940
- definitely have a monocle.
- I'm allergic to peanuts.

03:17.973 --> 03:19.707
So that has nothing
to do with this.

03:19.742 --> 03:23.045
This is a new era
of spectrumism.

03:23.078 --> 03:27.050
- It's the... it's...
- It's not gay or straight...

03:27.083 --> 03:32.488
We only really know what the top
one percent wants us to know.

03:32.521 --> 03:33.790
- Don't encourage.
- Dude.

03:33.823 --> 03:35.557
Ah, see this?

03:35.591 --> 03:37.559
That is what I'm saying.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.829
No, no, no, absolutely.

03:39.863 --> 03:43.199
I'm gonna go jerk off
thinking about you guys.

03:43.233 --> 03:45.902
He's such a funny guy.

03:45.936 --> 03:48.205
- He's funny, isn't he?
- That's what I'm saying, man.

03:48.239 --> 03:51.508
They only tell us
what they want us to know.

03:51.541 --> 03:54.211
They probably already found
the cure to cancer, you know?

03:54.245 --> 03:57.882
All right.

04:00.851 --> 04:04.889
Well, I have to take a shit.

04:04.922 --> 04:09.060
Yeah, take a shit, man.

04:12.264 --> 04:15.968
So, um, what's the show about?

04:16.001 --> 04:18.904
It's a web series.

04:18.937 --> 04:20.571
Mr. Cuddles' Tea Time.

04:20.604 --> 04:21.605
The famous turtle on Instagram.

04:21.639 --> 04:22.941
Have you not heard of him?

04:22.975 --> 04:25.077
You never heard of him?

04:25.110 --> 04:27.779
I don't know who
he is at all actually.

04:27.813 --> 04:30.015
Mr. Cuddles Tea Time,
people fucking love this.

04:30.048 --> 04:32.516
He's got a top hat.

04:32.550 --> 04:35.253
- People love that turtle.
- Absolutely.

04:35.287 --> 04:37.156
I don't understand,
how do you make a show

04:37.190 --> 04:39.591
- out of a turtle?
- How do you not?

04:39.624 --> 04:41.794
No, it's a talk show
and Cuddles is the host

04:41.828 --> 04:43.662
and other celebrity pets
come on the show.

04:43.695 --> 04:46.565
They drink tea, we hire voice
actors to speak for them.

04:46.598 --> 04:49.035
It sounds crazy but pet
celebrities are huge right now.

04:49.068 --> 04:51.104
Rob, Rob, Mr. Cuddles.

04:51.137 --> 04:52.704
What do you think about
Mr. Cuddles?

04:52.739 --> 04:55.041
- People love that turtle, man.
- See?

04:55.074 --> 04:57.676
Hold on though, isn't that
animal cruelty though?

04:57.709 --> 04:59.112
- No.
- No.

04:59.145 --> 05:01.647
Everyone gets paid.

05:01.681 --> 05:04.584
I think the turtle gets paid,
I assume.

05:04.617 --> 05:06.086
Does anybody want a refill?

05:06.120 --> 05:07.921
- Yes.
- Hard yes.

05:07.955 --> 05:09.622
Cheers.

06:04.880 --> 06:05.948

- Yeah.

06:05.981 --> 06:06.949
It's simple.

06:06.982 --> 06:08.150
Is that too much to ask?

06:08.184 --> 06:09.885
I'm talking too much, I'm sorry.

06:09.919 --> 06:11.619
No, I'm sorry.

06:11.654 --> 06:13.790

what are you doing out here?

06:13.824 --> 06:17.693

Everybody's...

06:26.403 --> 06:27.938
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's just

06:27.971 --> 06:29.106
I feel like I gave off...

06:29.139 --> 06:30.407
I gave off the wrong impression.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.675
Um, uh.

06:32.708 --> 06:35.011
No, you just have to know
something about me

06:35.045 --> 06:37.048
- which is that...
- Oh my God.

06:37.081 --> 06:38.816
- You're gay.
- What?

06:38.850 --> 06:42.153
You're gay, your hair
and your shirt and your teeth.

06:42.186 --> 06:43.955
You clearly use
whitening strips.

06:43.988 --> 06:44.956
- Thank you but...
- Oh my God.

06:44.989 --> 06:47.125
I'm such a fucking dipshit.

06:47.158 --> 06:49.827
I was gonna say
that I'm seeing someone.

06:49.861 --> 06:54.132
I'm seeing a girl.

06:54.165 --> 06:57.201
Oh.

06:57.235 --> 06:59.270
You aren't gay?

06:59.303 --> 07:01.240
I thought you were.

07:01.273 --> 07:03.775
I thought you were sleeping,
are you listening to all this?

07:03.809 --> 07:04.877
It's a spectrum, dude.

07:04.910 --> 07:07.980
I think about dicks.

07:10.048 --> 07:11.682
I'm really sorry.

07:11.716 --> 07:13.085
I am still jetlagged

07:13.118 --> 07:14.887
and I haven't had
anything to eat.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.855
- It's fine.
- And I mean, the shots.

07:16.889 --> 07:19.258
- Like, so sorry.
- No, seriously.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.260
Don't feel bad,
it was a lot of fun

07:21.293 --> 07:25.098
and we should do it more often.

07:25.131 --> 07:27.400
Yeah, totally.

07:27.433 --> 07:29.369
Are you sure you feel good
about getting home?

07:29.402 --> 07:31.437
- I will walk you.
- I'm good, I promise.

07:31.471 --> 07:33.705

- Okay.

07:33.740 --> 07:35.275

10:22.115 --> 10:25.618
I'm gonna need you

10:31.491 --> 10:34.494

10:43.404 --> 10:47.274
Harper?

10:47.308 --> 10:48.542
Oh my God.

10:48.576 --> 10:50.644
- Sorry, I just um...
- What's wrong?

10:50.678 --> 10:52.947
I was working on a scene
for acting class.

10:52.980 --> 10:55.182
I just really got into it,
sorry.

10:55.216 --> 11:00.155
What's your play about?

11:00.188 --> 11:04.593
It's about the bleaching
in the coral reefs.

11:04.626 --> 11:07.062
It's really fucking sad.

11:07.095 --> 11:09.564
Yeah, you're right that is sad.

11:09.598 --> 11:11.366
Think about it, the
temperature's gonna keep rising,

11:11.400 --> 11:13.301
- we're all gonna fucking die.
- Well, you know what?

11:13.335 --> 11:17.973
I have to sleep
for like two more hours.

11:18.006 --> 11:21.710
Mr. Peterson's got another
colonoscopy again.

11:21.744 --> 11:25.548

11:25.581 --> 11:28.317

your global warming project

11:28.351 --> 11:31.621
like a little down, sh.

11:31.654 --> 11:33.389
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

11:33.423 --> 11:36.359
I save fucking lives, Harper.

11:36.392 --> 11:39.262
It's a real job,
you know what I'm saying?

11:39.295 --> 11:40.663
Oh, that wine looks good.

11:40.696 --> 11:44.467
It looks like something
that I would buy.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.302
- Sorry.
- It's my last bottle, so.

11:46.335 --> 11:48.605
Oh.

11:48.639 --> 11:50.340
That's a lot of dishes.

11:50.374 --> 11:52.376

but you know...

11:52.409 --> 11:53.677

12:22.373 --> 12:24.309
Fuck.

14:05.180 --> 14:08.818
Come on.

14:13.924 --> 14:16.259
Ugh.

14:16.292 --> 14:17.895
Someone's calling on your phone.

14:17.928 --> 14:19.830
Someone's calling on your phone.

14:19.863 --> 14:21.564
Gotta pick it up,
gotta pick it up.

14:21.598 --> 14:23.433
Someone's calling
on your phone.

14:23.466 --> 14:25.368
Someone's calling on your phone.

14:25.401 --> 14:27.270
Gotta pick it up,
gotta pick it up.

14:27.303 --> 14:31.207
Someone's calling on your phone.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.343
Museum of sodomy
and the dark arts.

14:33.376 --> 14:34.912
Please hold.

14:34.945 --> 14:36.547
So I've been watching
a lot of YouTube clips.

14:36.580 --> 14:38.415
I think I perfected
my Australian accent.

14:38.449 --> 14:41.820
- It's getting so good.
- So good.

14:41.853 --> 14:44.655
Do you know shrimp on a barbie's
a racist term for a dingo?

14:44.688 --> 14:46.690
- No?
- That's just sling

14:46.724 --> 14:49.693
for throwing your pecker
into a kangaroo's pouch.

14:49.727 --> 14:51.495
Hey Harp?

14:51.528 --> 14:53.330
You coming to my show tonight,
right?

14:53.364 --> 14:56.700
- Oh shit, that's tonight?
- My heart.

14:56.734 --> 14:58.903
I told you,
I have to have you be there.

14:58.937 --> 15:00.372
Yeah, I'm just fucking with you.

15:00.405 --> 15:01.606
I'm coming.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.607
Okay, cool.

15:02.641 --> 15:04.376
Hey, it's a BYOB.

15:04.409 --> 15:06.711
B your Bs but also,
could you B me a B?

15:06.746 --> 15:08.446
That'd be G.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.782
I don't think I'm gonna be
drinking at all

15:09.815 --> 15:11.683
after last night.

15:11.716 --> 15:13.184
Seriously?

15:18.556 --> 15:22.260
- Oh, hello.
- You dick.

15:22.293 --> 15:24.831
It is I, Edward
all of the alcohol

15:24.865 --> 15:26.933
I had left in my cabinets hands.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.701
Are you the little boy
that lives in the scary house

15:28.734 --> 15:30.937
on top of the hill
at the end of the cul-de-sac?

15:30.971 --> 15:34.640
My father made my heart
from a sugar cookie.

15:34.674 --> 15:38.511
- Come drink with me.
- I don't want to.

15:38.544 --> 15:40.212
But I taped all these things
to my fingers.

15:40.246 --> 15:41.848
You gotta drink with me.

15:41.882 --> 15:45.317
- Ah.
- Okay.

15:45.351 --> 15:47.789
Just stay away
from my water bed.

15:47.822 --> 15:51.324
Let's crack these open, huh?

15:58.265 --> 15:59.967
Do you know, I think a had
a bit of a breakthrough

16:00.001 --> 16:01.936
with my project.

16:01.969 --> 16:03.805
The Santa Claus movie or?

16:03.838 --> 16:05.572
That one's on hold right now.

16:05.605 --> 16:08.442
I mean, sure, it shot up
two percent on Kickstarter.

16:08.475 --> 16:09.844
Thanks for donating, by the way.

16:09.877 --> 16:10.945
- Yeah, no problem.
- But I think I'm gonna put that

16:10.978 --> 16:12.714
on hold for a little while.

16:12.748 --> 16:14.582
My pop-up stand up,
the thing for tonight,

16:14.615 --> 16:18.352
I got... I'm gonna attack it from
a slightly different angle.

16:18.386 --> 16:19.988
- I think you're gonna like it.
- Oh, that's awesome.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.656
- Yeah, it's gonna be good.
- So you thought about

16:21.689 --> 16:25.794
- like open mics doing that or?
- Nah, no, no, no.

16:25.828 --> 16:27.328
Open mics are dead.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.629
You're not telling jokes
to people.

16:28.663 --> 16:30.298
You're telling jokes
to comedians.

16:30.331 --> 16:31.733
- That's true.
- They're the worst people.

16:31.767 --> 16:32.901
I should know.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.439
Beautiful view.

16:37.473 --> 16:40.576
So you got pretty swasted
at the party last night, huh?

16:40.609 --> 16:42.411
I did get swasted.

16:42.444 --> 16:44.781
Unfortunately,
it was not a party.

16:44.814 --> 16:47.516
- At all, at all.
- So you did like a Home Alone.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.018
You went all Kevin McCallister
on that shit.

16:49.052 --> 16:50.954
- A little bit.
- Oh man.

16:50.987 --> 16:53.288
- Oh, that's never good.
- Not really proud of that.

16:53.322 --> 16:56.793
I tried to make moves
on my cute neighbor.

16:56.826 --> 16:58.727
Mrs. Campbell?
She's like 87 years old.

16:58.762 --> 16:59.897
No, not Mrs. Campbell.

16:59.930 --> 17:01.464
Paul, like super hot Paul.

17:01.498 --> 17:02.933
Oh yeah, gay Paul.

17:02.967 --> 17:05.468
Gay for me probably but yeah.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.337
I mean, I tried
to make it happen.

17:07.370 --> 17:08.773
If I could give you
once piece of advice

17:08.806 --> 17:10.673
it's never hook up
with your neighbors.

17:10.707 --> 17:11.942
It's too embarrassing.

17:11.976 --> 17:13.778
Taking out trash,
you're checking the mail

17:13.811 --> 17:16.080
and you're like, oh,
look at all these coupons, huh?

17:16.113 --> 17:18.481
- Huh? Remember me?
- Woo yeah.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.416
Thanks for trying to put
your dick in me, Paul.

17:20.450 --> 17:21.886
Ew, gross.

17:21.919 --> 17:25.389
Wait, did you have sex
with Paul last night?

17:25.422 --> 17:29.861
No but I wanted to.

17:29.895 --> 17:32.898
Sorry, I got triple taken aback.

17:32.931 --> 17:34.800
- He's cute.
- I just never thought of you

17:34.833 --> 17:36.700
as the like...

17:36.734 --> 17:39.336
fuck a guy kind
of like when you first meet him.

17:39.370 --> 17:40.939
I would so fuck a guy.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.340
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

17:44.910 --> 17:46.644
Oh hey, what time is it?

17:46.677 --> 17:48.680
Uh, three o'clock.

17:48.713 --> 17:51.716
Oh shit, I gotta go prep.

17:51.751 --> 17:52.985
Imma see you tonight, right?

17:53.019 --> 17:54.053
With bells.

17:54.086 --> 17:57.890
- Bye!
- Bye!

18:10.770 --> 18:13.874
At the end of your message
press one.

18:13.907 --> 18:16.009
Harper Lee, what up!

18:16.043 --> 18:17.510
I think you just got back.

18:17.543 --> 18:18.779
Uh, I don't want to bother you

18:18.812 --> 18:22.015
but I do really need
you right now.

18:22.049 --> 18:23.851
So if you could swing on by,
bring a swimsuit

18:23.884 --> 18:26.787
and we'll hang
like a spa office meeting.

18:26.820 --> 18:28.088
Get here like
as soon as you can.

18:28.121 --> 18:29.923
Bye.

18:29.957 --> 18:31.691
You know, I seriously doubt
my Uber's gonna let me

18:31.724 --> 18:33.426
in the car like this.

18:40.734 --> 18:42.937
Can we uh,
move the meeting on Thursday

18:42.971 --> 18:45.505
cause I have uh, CrossFit now.

18:45.539 --> 18:46.673
I didn't know
you were doing CrossFit.

18:46.707 --> 18:49.911
Yeah, fucking awesome.

18:49.944 --> 18:51.012
Well, I haven't done it yet

18:51.045 --> 18:53.547
but it's just like awesome.

18:53.580 --> 18:54.983
Oh, um, Buchwald emailed

18:55.016 --> 18:56.650
and said that you have a couple
of meetings that day.

18:56.683 --> 18:58.418
Sorry about that,
I forgot to tell yah.

18:58.452 --> 19:01.422
- Seriously? For what?
- One is for an app commercial

19:01.456 --> 19:03.926
and the other
is for a studio pilot.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.426
Yes!

19:05.460 --> 19:06.661
Are you fucking serious?

19:06.694 --> 19:08.596
CBS? NBC? TBS?

19:08.630 --> 19:10.665
It's actually Netflix.

19:10.698 --> 19:12.201
Woo!

19:12.234 --> 19:13.969
Streaming.

19:14.003 --> 19:15.603
Fuck.

19:15.637 --> 19:16.939
Streaming's the future.

19:16.972 --> 19:18.506
Booo!

19:18.539 --> 19:20.642
All right, I'll start CrossFit
next week.

19:20.675 --> 19:24.647
Just call Vlad
and just have him reschedule.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.883
He's in my phone
as "CrossFit Dude."

19:26.917 --> 19:28.785
Or he may be
in my phone as "Vlad."

19:28.818 --> 19:30.053
Okay.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.721
Done and done.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.891
- It's hot.
- Yup, we'll you know.

19:34.925 --> 19:39.162
Its' 95 degrees on a roof
in a hot Jacuzzi.

19:42.866 --> 19:46.202
Glad to have you back, Harper.

19:46.236 --> 19:50.540
Glad to be back.

19:50.573 --> 19:53.844
- Did anything cool?
- Cool?

19:53.878 --> 19:55.679
'Cause I want you to know
you can talk to me.

19:55.712 --> 19:59.716
Like if you ever feel
like you need to talk to me.

19:59.749 --> 20:01.118
Oh yeah, you know, I'm fine.

20:01.152 --> 20:03.054
- Thanks for asking.
- I know like technically

20:03.087 --> 20:09.226
I'm your boss but I want us
to be like close friends.

20:09.260 --> 20:10.761
Really?

20:10.796 --> 20:12.596
Like talk about boys
and have sleepovers

20:12.630 --> 20:14.532
and all that stuff?

20:14.565 --> 20:16.634
Yeah, you serious?

20:16.667 --> 20:17.936
I was schooled like on set.

20:17.970 --> 20:20.604
Never had a sleepover
ever in my life.

20:20.638 --> 20:24.508
Oh, I was kidding.

20:24.542 --> 20:25.978
Sorry.

20:29.047 --> 20:31.016
Dude!

20:31.049 --> 20:32.084
Love it.

20:32.117 --> 20:33.517
That's why I like you.

20:33.551 --> 20:34.988
'Cause you're funny.

20:35.021 --> 20:37.056
It's good to laugh.

20:37.090 --> 20:41.794
Humor heals.

20:41.828 --> 20:44.563
Okay, so I'm just gonna
reschedule that CrossFit...

20:44.596 --> 20:46.565
Yeah, I read statistically
friends talk about sex

20:46.598 --> 20:49.902
like two to three times a day.

20:49.936 --> 20:51.570
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:51.603 --> 20:53.638
Like statistically on average.

20:53.672 --> 20:56.742
Well, that seems
like valuable information.

20:56.776 --> 20:59.213
How's your sex life?

20:59.246 --> 21:01.748
Uh, my sex life?

21:01.782 --> 21:03.716
Come on, I'm like talking
like friends.

21:03.750 --> 21:04.885
We're friends,
friends talk about sex

21:04.918 --> 21:07.121
I just told you that.

21:07.154 --> 21:10.656
Okay, well,
thank you for asking, friend.

21:10.690 --> 21:16.096
But um, there's really not one
to speak of so there's that.

21:16.130 --> 21:18.332
What? Are you serious?

21:18.365 --> 21:21.335
You're like awesome.

21:21.368 --> 21:26.274
Thank you.

21:26.307 --> 21:28.675
My friends have sex with
each other like all the time.

21:28.709 --> 21:31.846
It relieves stress,
if you need me to...

21:31.880 --> 21:33.114
Not in like a harassment way.

21:33.148 --> 21:34.215
I'm just talking about like...

21:34.249 --> 21:35.616
Okay, I'm good, thank you.

21:35.649 --> 21:39.220
I'm open if you need it.

21:41.823 --> 21:43.858
The gear?

21:43.892 --> 21:46.829
Um, I'm actually gonna get these
notes started back home, okay?

21:46.862 --> 21:48.364
What? Stay.

21:48.397 --> 21:50.866
I got the NES Classic.
We can play Castlevania.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.902
It's one-player,
you can like watch me play.

21:52.935 --> 21:54.804
I'm sorry, I can't.
Thanks though.

21:54.837 --> 21:56.205
Okay, you can play,
I'll watch you.

21:56.238 --> 21:57.639
No, no, no, I mean,
I really can't.

21:57.672 --> 22:00.242
I have a thing
to go to tonight.

22:00.276 --> 22:02.111
No way, what's this thing?

22:02.144 --> 22:04.246
I have a friend,
he's a comedian.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.048
I fucking love stand-up,
are you serious?

22:06.082 --> 22:08.284
Can I go?

22:08.317 --> 22:10.119
It's not really stand-up
that he does.

22:10.152 --> 22:12.755
- I can't explain it.
- Puppet stuff?

22:12.789 --> 22:14.657
- You like puppets?
- Fucking love puppets.

22:14.690 --> 22:15.724
Jeff Dunham's
like an inspiration...

22:15.759 --> 22:18.361
more than an inspiration.

22:18.395 --> 22:21.298
Can I go?

22:21.331 --> 22:23.333
Sure, I could text you
the information.

22:23.366 --> 22:26.103
Yes, I'm gonna go shit
and shower.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.670
Text me the stuff, dude.

22:27.703 --> 22:29.172
I will be there.

22:29.206 --> 22:32.175
I'll see you there.

22:37.081 --> 22:38.916
- Fuck.
- Hi, I'm Stinko,

22:38.950 --> 22:41.219
the racist sock puppet.

22:41.252 --> 22:45.823
Don't you just want to hear
some stand-up comedy from me?

22:45.857 --> 22:48.692
No, because puppets are stupid.

22:48.725 --> 22:50.094
Is it recording?

22:50.128 --> 22:51.329
Is it good? Yeah we're good?

22:51.362 --> 22:52.430
Okay, so you got it?

22:52.463 --> 22:55.133
Hey! How's it going, I'm Dusty.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.734
You're watching the second
episode of Pop-up Stand-up.

22:57.768 --> 22:59.138
Tonight, we're downtown.

22:59.171 --> 23:01.373
I'm gonna talk to transits
and transvestites.

23:01.406 --> 23:03.775
I lived up in Silver Lake.

23:03.809 --> 23:06.145
There were some raccoons
getting into the trash

23:06.178 --> 23:08.947
and I thought for a second
maybe they were going for food

23:08.981 --> 23:10.249
but I also thought maybe
raccoons

23:10.282 --> 23:13.418
are just trying to steal
our identities.

23:13.452 --> 23:15.921
Maybe that's what's happening.

23:15.954 --> 23:17.156
Hey, fuck you, man.

23:17.189 --> 23:18.824
Not cool, yeah.

23:18.857 --> 23:20.092
We're live,
we're doing this live.

23:20.125 --> 23:21.793
You're hilarious, man.

23:21.827 --> 23:23.129
This guy likes it, I love it.

23:23.163 --> 23:25.798
Fucking hilarious, blahh.

23:25.832 --> 23:27.733
I didn't really write
any new material for this.

23:27.767 --> 23:30.170
Ugh, ugh.

23:30.203 --> 23:33.039
Ugh.

23:33.072 --> 23:36.075
Sometimes I'll be like...

23:36.109 --> 23:38.744
and then you hold.

23:38.778 --> 23:40.313
And then you start going again.

23:40.346 --> 23:41.848
And then you start going again.

23:41.881 --> 23:43.249
That's one of
the best things possible.

23:43.283 --> 23:44.317
We going anywhere else?

23:44.350 --> 23:45.485
We're gonna go down subways.

23:45.518 --> 23:47.087
We're gonna go into ramen shops.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.356
We're gonna make a lot
of people mad at me.

23:49.390 --> 23:51.225
- So you're a tailor?
- Yes.

23:51.258 --> 23:53.027
Yeah, what do you tail?

23:56.163 --> 23:59.200
You want to try
to guess his inseam?

23:59.233 --> 24:01.835
- Yes.
- That's all right, man.

24:01.869 --> 24:04.371
You can't do anything without
an app, you know what I mean.

24:04.405 --> 24:06.840
'Cause when I was a kid
you would go outside and play.

24:06.874 --> 24:09.109
That's just what we did,
we'd go outside.

24:09.143 --> 24:11.947
I would run through the woods,
I'd hang out in a cul-de-sac.

24:11.980 --> 24:14.783
- Excuse me, you can't be here.
- Cool man, nice to meet you.

24:14.816 --> 24:16.318
Look, I'm just gonna finish
this up...

24:16.351 --> 24:18.119
Listen, you can't be here.
You have no permit.

24:18.153 --> 24:19.921
No, I got a permit,
I got a permit.

24:19.955 --> 24:23.058
It's uh, could you read that
and tell me what it says please?

24:23.091 --> 24:25.427
It says admit one. I'm the one.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.495
Let me call George real quick.

24:27.529 --> 24:30.332
Hey, isn't it fun to do live TV.

24:30.365 --> 24:32.133
Hey, aren't you famous?

24:32.167 --> 24:33.168
Yeah, dude, what's up, man?

24:33.201 --> 24:34.837
Hey, how you been?

24:34.870 --> 24:37.006
- Can I get a picture with you?
- Yeah.

24:37.039 --> 24:41.444
- Thank you.
- I'm on a live stream!

24:41.477 --> 24:43.779
Hey, Greg, right on!

24:43.813 --> 24:45.348
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
- No problem, no problem.

24:45.381 --> 24:47.883
- Can he keep telling jokes...
- No, no, no.

24:47.917 --> 24:49.952
You can stay, he can't.

24:49.986 --> 24:51.921
We'll get out of here.

24:51.954 --> 24:53.322
I'm just gonna finish
this joke then we're out.

24:53.356 --> 24:54.824
Cool, thanks man.
Have a good one.

24:54.857 --> 24:56.259
He can stay, you can't,
sorry about that.

24:56.292 --> 24:57.893
That's very rude.

24:57.927 --> 25:00.297
That was fun,
how many people we up to now?

25:00.330 --> 25:01.999
Nine.

25:02.032 --> 25:04.568
Uh, let's keep riffing.

25:04.601 --> 25:07.871
Okay!

25:07.904 --> 25:09.039
Happy hour place!

25:09.072 --> 25:11.141
It's an Asian fusion
which is good.

25:11.174 --> 25:12.576
- I like it...
- Oh, god!

25:12.609 --> 25:14.077
Are you okay? Are you okay?

25:14.111 --> 25:16.880
Are you okay?
Are you okay, Dusty?

25:39.203 --> 25:41.439
- I think you broke it.
- No, no, I didn't.

25:41.472 --> 25:43.441
- No, you broke it.
- No, I really did not.

25:43.474 --> 25:45.343
- I think you did a great job.
- Thank you so much.

25:45.376 --> 25:48.147
Looks like you took a shell
off of a turtle's back

25:48.180 --> 25:50.316
and then put duct tape on it
and you're wearing it.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.918
I want to watch you...
Oh, he's taking it off.

25:52.951 --> 25:58.324
- He's taking it off.
- I do this for a night.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.859
I do about two hours
of running around

26:00.893 --> 26:04.530
and by the end I have about
maybe 30 seconds of jokes

26:04.563 --> 26:06.865
I want to revisit again
at another adventure.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.467
I've seen an heirloom tomato.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.471
I've seen a woman's genitals
and there's a connection there.

26:11.504 --> 26:14.174
I don't know what the joke is
yet but it's there.

26:14.207 --> 26:17.610
But it's like beautiful
and still tastes delicious.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.279
Ugh.

26:19.312 --> 26:22.048
- You're funny.
- Thank you so much.

26:22.082 --> 26:23.216
- Should we go?
- I think we should go.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.185
Let's just leave him.

26:25.218 --> 26:30.423
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:37.932 --> 26:39.100
My ex-girlfriend
used to always say

26:39.133 --> 26:41.369
that she'd see shooting stars.

26:41.402 --> 26:45.439
I felt like she just didn't know
what planes look like.

26:48.376 --> 26:50.244
Dude, you gotta stop slaying me.

26:50.277 --> 26:51.412
Yeah this place is incredible.

26:51.445 --> 26:53.247
This is your place?

26:53.280 --> 26:57.017
Um, yeah, it's mine.

26:57.051 --> 26:58.520
Oh my God, Dusty,
check this shit out.

26:58.553 --> 27:01.356
Somebody just said,
"This is the greatest livestream

27:01.390 --> 27:02.357
I've ever seen.

27:02.391 --> 27:03.959
Hands down, period."

27:03.992 --> 27:05.394
Well, that's rad.

27:05.427 --> 27:07.229
"Hands down, period."

27:07.262 --> 27:08.997
- Hello!
- Who said that?

27:09.030 --> 27:15.036
- Uh, Sarcastic Panda 27.
- Awesome.

27:15.070 --> 27:17.172
Oh and your mom
says you're cute.

27:17.205 --> 27:18.206
- Yup.
- Do you understand

27:18.240 --> 27:19.241
how good that was?

27:19.274 --> 27:21.042
Like literally bing!

27:21.076 --> 27:22.344
And from the boom!

27:22.378 --> 27:24.313
It was super amazing.

27:24.347 --> 27:25.948
Right? This energy...

27:28.184 --> 27:29.552
Sorcerer man.

27:29.585 --> 27:31.087
He stays up there.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.055
La boom!

27:33.089 --> 27:34.290
With all love,
you know what I mean?

27:34.323 --> 27:36.426
- That's intense.
- Delicious, yeah.

27:36.459 --> 27:38.394
Harper here has been talking
about this all the time.

27:38.428 --> 27:40.463
Like the sorcerer stuff
and the love.

27:40.496 --> 27:42.965
- Yeah.
- So what is uh, sorry.

27:42.999 --> 27:45.034
What is this dynamic?

27:45.067 --> 27:46.570
Oh, like how we know each other?

27:46.603 --> 27:48.372
I'm her boss, right.

27:48.405 --> 27:50.340
Right, I'm his assistant, yeah.

27:50.374 --> 27:52.209
I just had assumed
that you knew that I assist

27:52.242 --> 27:56.180
Kyle Fairchild
from Greg's Room on ABC.

27:56.213 --> 27:58.248
ABC Family, hit show.

27:58.282 --> 28:00.050
Greg's Room. Yeah, of course.

28:00.083 --> 28:01.218
It's all right,
you don't have to lie.

28:01.251 --> 28:02.486
It's a shitty show.

28:02.519 --> 28:04.688
No, it's... it's pretty good, man.

28:04.721 --> 28:07.458
You got a TV gig,
it's billboards everywhere.

28:07.491 --> 28:11.029
It gets me like all this
but sometimes it's like...

28:11.062 --> 28:13.131
What's in here?

28:13.164 --> 28:15.467
You know what I mean?

28:15.500 --> 28:17.569
I mean, it's like
I don't know sometimes.

28:17.602 --> 28:19.471
- But I feel good.
- Cool man, no,

28:19.504 --> 28:20.738
thanks for letting me
up here though.

28:20.772 --> 28:22.240
This has been a cool night.

28:22.273 --> 28:25.443
My friend reps comics.

28:25.477 --> 28:27.145
So you know what you need to do?

28:27.178 --> 28:30.014
- Uh?
- You gotta get me that info.

28:30.048 --> 28:32.383
I need you to send me right...

28:32.417 --> 28:35.254
headshot, FB, Instagram,
you on Twitter?

28:35.287 --> 28:36.722
- Get me your Twitter.
- Cool yeah, I can send you

28:36.755 --> 28:37.924
my website
and all sorts of stuff.

28:37.958 --> 28:40.593
Yeah, send it to Harper
and she'll like give it to me.

28:40.626 --> 28:43.195
- Yeah, I mean.
- Cool. Hi, I'm Dusty.

28:43.229 --> 28:45.030
Let's be friends.

28:45.064 --> 28:47.500
This isn't a gift, this is
just my friendship for you.

28:47.533 --> 28:51.203
And this is a gift, okay.

28:51.237 --> 28:52.571
Hold on, look at this.

28:52.605 --> 28:55.074
Boom, boom, boom.

28:55.107 --> 28:56.709
Boom.

28:56.742 --> 28:59.579
Wha-wha-wha-woah.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.082
Yeah!

29:02.115 --> 29:05.085
Sparkling, uh, grape juice.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.354
Cool, I'm not usually
like a sweets guy.

29:07.387 --> 29:10.690
Yeah, I mean yeah,
I'm spiking it with whiskey.

29:10.724 --> 29:12.392
Fucking awesome.

29:12.425 --> 29:15.762
This is called
the whiskey sandwich.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.597
It's a play on a PB and J?

29:17.631 --> 29:19.800
- Yeah.
- Okay, that kind of makes sense

29:19.834 --> 29:23.805
- I guess.
- To a wonderful, new friendship.

29:23.839 --> 29:25.139
I'm cool with that.

29:25.172 --> 29:26.374
New found friendship.

29:26.407 --> 29:29.210
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.382
That's actually... that's actually
really good.

29:34.415 --> 29:36.350
- Whiskey sandwich.
- That's actually really good.

29:36.384 --> 29:38.119
There's a party tonight.

29:38.152 --> 29:40.655
Right here, downtown, like
right under that green building.

29:40.688 --> 29:47.195
It's at this like
art space/hair salon.

29:47.229 --> 29:49.164
Actually, it's like a loft

29:49.197 --> 29:51.300
with cool art in it

29:51.333 --> 29:52.367
and you can get your haircut

29:52.401 --> 29:53.435
for like 300 bucks.

29:53.468 --> 29:55.370
Oh wow, what a deal.

29:55.404 --> 29:58.875
Fucking party with me, dude!

29:58.908 --> 30:00.642
- You're coming!
- I'm probably just gonna

30:00.676 --> 30:02.744
- head home honestly.
- Dude what?

30:02.779 --> 30:04.246
We're gonna have alcohol.

30:04.279 --> 30:06.348
I will literally buy you
a haircut for this.

30:06.381 --> 30:09.384
- There's gonna be weed.
- I mean, I'm down to party.

30:09.418 --> 30:12.655
- Okay, I'll get the Uber.

32:55.792 --> 32:56.993
Yeah my friend Charlie
wrote the music

32:57.026 --> 32:59.897
and I did like everything else.

32:59.930 --> 33:01.799
- Sounds sick, dude.
- Thanks for listening

33:01.832 --> 33:04.667
- to Salty Stream.
- The salmon, uh,

33:04.701 --> 33:05.870
they stream upstream though,
yeah?

33:05.903 --> 33:08.038
Yeah, sure do.

33:08.072 --> 33:10.373
How could the water guide
them home

33:10.406 --> 33:12.742
if it's literally
just pushing them back?

33:12.776 --> 33:14.744
They swim in fresh water.

33:14.778 --> 33:18.615
- It's more of a metaphor.
- Yeah, I liked it.

33:18.648 --> 33:20.350
Good insight I see, thank you.

33:20.383 --> 33:21.684
- And they're adults.
- Looks like you need

33:21.718 --> 33:23.054
a little refresher
on your cocktail.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.488
Can I get you a Moscow mule?

33:24.522 --> 33:25.924
I love Moscow mules.

33:25.957 --> 33:27.591
Well, okay.

33:27.625 --> 33:28.960
See if we got any fresh...

33:28.994 --> 33:31.462
Oy, you got some limes?

33:31.495 --> 33:34.331
Fresh limers?

33:34.365 --> 33:35.566
Limers.

33:35.599 --> 33:37.334
He got the part
that water's wet.

33:40.704 --> 33:42.473
He's so good.

33:42.506 --> 33:43.909
Hey, thanks for coming
to my show tonight.

33:43.942 --> 33:45.576
- Seriously, that was huge.
- Yeah, of course.

33:45.609 --> 33:47.512
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

33:47.546 --> 33:48.647
It's really nice to know
that there's someone

33:48.680 --> 33:50.448
in this town who has my back.

33:50.482 --> 33:51.918
It can be kind of a selfish,
soulless place.

33:51.951 --> 33:53.585
I'm not sure if you knew that.

33:53.618 --> 33:54.987
You know I invited
like 30 people

33:55.021 --> 33:57.589
to come help out with the show?
No one showed up.

33:57.622 --> 33:59.491
You're the only person
that showed up.

33:59.524 --> 34:00.725
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:00.759 --> 34:02.128
Pf, their loss.

34:02.161 --> 34:03.628
I can't even tell you
how many times

34:03.662 --> 34:05.031
I go and see one-man shows.

34:05.064 --> 34:06.966
I can't even get one person
to help me out.

34:06.999 --> 34:09.601
I get it, you know, people
have their own shit going on.

34:09.634 --> 34:12.105
For a city just full of artists,

34:12.139 --> 34:13.907
you'd think that people would
be more supportive

34:13.941 --> 34:15.675
of each other's projects
and endeavors.

34:15.708 --> 34:16.944
Should be the exact opposite
of that.

34:16.977 --> 34:19.612
We need to come together
and be a community.

34:19.645 --> 34:22.582
Alone, we can illuminate
the light within ourselves

34:22.615 --> 34:24.985
to cultivate art
that is self examined,

34:25.018 --> 34:28.387
curious, new, and original,
but together

34:28.421 --> 34:30.958
we can illuminate
the light in the universe

34:30.991 --> 34:33.060
to create art that is cognizant,

34:33.093 --> 34:35.395
aggressive and powerful.

34:35.429 --> 34:37.731
Squares in a cosmic
Rubik's Cube.

34:37.764 --> 34:41.936
We're just different shapes
of selfish ambition.

34:41.970 --> 34:45.706
Twisted and lost, incomplete.

34:45.739 --> 34:47.075
But if we work together,

34:47.108 --> 34:51.045
if we truly work together

34:51.079 --> 34:52.947
we are a star.

34:59.454 --> 35:01.056
Are you a God?

35:04.726 --> 35:07.029
No, my name is Marcus

35:07.062 --> 35:12.767
but my people call me Truth.

35:12.801 --> 35:15.603
Ya'll should come check out
my poetry slam next week.

35:15.637 --> 35:18.040
I don't rhyme, I keeps it real.

35:18.073 --> 35:19.108
So you like the X-Files?

35:19.141 --> 35:20.809
Hells yah, man.

35:20.843 --> 35:24.747
Scully is the OG
of the alien finding business.

35:24.780 --> 35:26.482
The bitch had... what was it?

35:26.515 --> 35:29.019
Section 54 Arizona,
whatever that shit is called.

35:29.052 --> 35:30.921
- Area 51.
- Can you give me my card back?

35:30.954 --> 35:32.688
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- Yeah, I gotta use this

35:32.721 --> 35:35.491
for other parties but you
remember the Instagram info,

35:35.524 --> 35:36.826
- right?
- Right, yeah.

35:36.860 --> 35:38.694
Cool, keep creating.

35:38.727 --> 35:42.731
Okay, bye.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.533
Is it bad after the whole spiel

35:44.566 --> 35:49.606
if we don't go
to Marcus' poetry slam?

35:49.639 --> 35:50.875
Can I ask you a question?

35:50.908 --> 35:53.244
Is it about the universe?

35:53.277 --> 35:55.146
Oo.

35:55.179 --> 35:58.249
No.

35:58.282 --> 36:00.717
Do you think I have a chance?

36:00.750 --> 36:02.019
Any chance at all?

36:02.053 --> 36:03.988
What do you mean?
Like with comedy?

36:04.021 --> 36:07.757
No, to get laid
at this fucking party tonight.

36:07.791 --> 36:12.064
Seriously dude,
I think you're one of the most

36:12.097 --> 36:15.067
funny, inventive artists

36:15.100 --> 36:17.035
I've ever had the pleasure
of knowing.

36:17.069 --> 36:20.973
I think... I think
you can hit it big.

36:21.006 --> 36:25.077
- Thanks Harper.
- You're welcome.

36:25.110 --> 36:27.079
Fucking love you, dude.

36:27.112 --> 36:32.017
I fucking love you too, bro.

36:32.050 --> 36:34.053
Hey, do you wanna get fucking
stupid at this party

36:34.087 --> 36:36.122
then go eat some super late
night Mexican food?

36:36.155 --> 36:38.257
- Oh, fuck yeah.
- Cool, help me up.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.059
All right, oh my god.

36:40.093 --> 36:41.861
No, push your foot
off of my foot.

36:41.894 --> 36:44.864
- Find the fulcrum.
- Oh my god.

36:44.897 --> 36:46.866
- I can't do it.
- You ever had a Moscow mule

36:46.899 --> 36:48.667
made by a TV star before?

36:48.700 --> 36:51.971
- Yeah.

Oh hey, Paul.

37:26.908 --> 37:29.144
What are you up to?

37:29.177 --> 37:31.212
Just walking to my apartment.

37:31.246 --> 37:35.582
Oh, cool.

37:37.751 --> 37:39.586
Is everything okay?

37:39.620 --> 37:41.890
Yeah uh...

37:41.923 --> 37:45.326
I'm just, uh, I'm tired.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.297
Okay, just gonna keep walking
to my apartment.

37:48.330 --> 37:50.698
Yeah.

37:50.732 --> 37:55.905
Jenn broke up with me.

37:55.938 --> 37:57.173
Yeah.

37:57.206 --> 38:00.976
Wow, sorry.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.946
I've just been kind of
a wreck in there

38:03.979 --> 38:06.614
and then uh,
I watched that movie

38:06.648 --> 38:09.351
My Dog Skip.

38:09.385 --> 38:12.022
- Why did I do that?
- It's brutal.

38:12.055 --> 38:14.091
The first half of the movie,
you know, it's so happy

38:14.124 --> 38:16.026
and then the second half is...

38:16.059 --> 38:17.360
Shits all over your heart.

38:17.394 --> 38:23.867
It totally shits on your heart.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.802
So you like need somebody
to talk to?

38:25.836 --> 38:27.037
Oh my god, yes,
that would be so great.

38:27.070 --> 38:28.972
I have beer, I've got wine.

38:29.005 --> 38:31.975
The little bottles,
the Sutter Home ones.

38:32.008 --> 38:35.179
Jenn, uh,
she loved those bottles.

38:35.213 --> 38:38.715
- Paul?
- Yeah?

38:41.751 --> 38:43.187
Oh, god, I'm sorry.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.289
No pants, hold on sorry.

38:45.323 --> 38:50.261
Sorry.

38:50.294 --> 38:52.864
That is so embarrassing.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.298
I'm embarrassed.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.234
It happens all the time
I'm sure.

38:56.267 --> 38:58.103
I think to walk around
my apartment naked

38:58.137 --> 38:59.770
when I'm alone.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.273
I don't know,
the bottle half off

39:01.306 --> 39:02.673
it's like there's
a little breeze.

39:02.707 --> 39:03.876
I don't know, I don't know.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.410
It's weird, right?

39:05.444 --> 39:07.112
No, it's nice.

39:07.146 --> 39:11.984
Maybe I can help you
with the top half?

39:27.766 --> 39:32.372
This is not at all
what I expected to happen.

39:32.405 --> 39:35.275
,
it's a one night thing?

39:35.308 --> 39:36.843
This can be something, is this...

39:36.876 --> 39:38.478
Okay, shut the fuck up, Paul.

39:45.351 --> 39:49.423
Man, I haven't stopped drinking
since the flight home.

39:49.456 --> 39:53.227
Really?

39:53.260 --> 39:55.129
Kick ass, man.

39:55.162 --> 39:58.199
I think I'm an alcoholic though.

39:58.232 --> 40:00.401
You are not an alcoholic.

40:00.434 --> 40:02.436
I mean, how do you know?

40:02.469 --> 40:04.471
Because my brother
is an alcoholic

40:04.505 --> 40:05.738
and I know what one looks like

40:05.772 --> 40:10.345
and you, my friend, are not one.

40:10.378 --> 40:13.048
I'm drinking shitty wine at 3AM.

40:13.081 --> 40:16.284
I just drunk fucked my neighbor.

40:16.318 --> 40:19.154
How could I not be one?

40:19.187 --> 40:21.489
Okay, do you wake up
craving alcohol?

40:21.523 --> 40:23.024
Do you need alcohol
to physically function

40:23.058 --> 40:24.092
- during the day?
- No.

40:24.125 --> 40:26.027
Then you're not an alcoholic.

40:26.061 --> 40:27.462
Yeah, you have
a drinking problem.

40:27.495 --> 40:30.131
A lot of people who drink do.

40:30.165 --> 40:32.968
Okay, so what's the difference,
Dr. Phil?

40:33.001 --> 40:35.504
People that use alcohol
to numb pain in their lives

40:35.538 --> 40:37.106
have a drinking problem
and some of those people

40:37.139 --> 40:39.141
never solve those problems.

40:39.175 --> 40:41.377
Those people
will become alcoholics.

40:41.410 --> 40:42.478
Can you pass me another one?

40:42.511 --> 40:45.514
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

40:45.548 --> 40:48.484
Here you go.

40:48.517 --> 40:50.820
Did you learn this at like
an AA meeting or something?

40:50.853 --> 40:53.356
No, I read it on a menu.

40:53.389 --> 40:59.296
It's where I get all
of my definitive information.

40:59.329 --> 41:02.866
How you feeling, by the way?

41:02.899 --> 41:06.303
Oh, um, I came, thanks.

41:06.336 --> 41:09.940
That's not what I meant,
I meant with like, you know,

41:09.973 --> 41:12.809
your family stuff.

41:12.843 --> 41:15.812
How are you?

41:15.846 --> 41:17.948
I'm fine, it's fine.

41:17.981 --> 41:19.983
I wasn't trying
to overstep any boundaries.

41:20.017 --> 41:21.819
No, it's okay.

41:21.853 --> 41:23.221
If you want to talk
about anything I'm... I'm

41:23.254 --> 41:26.491
- you know, I'm here.
- Okay, yeah.

41:26.524 --> 41:30.895
Okay.

41:30.928 --> 41:33.564
Hey, it's not gonna get
like weird, right?

41:33.598 --> 41:35.033
No, I don't think it
was gonna get weird

41:35.066 --> 41:37.235
until like a little bit later.

41:37.268 --> 41:39.237
Like a wedding chapel
or something.

41:39.270 --> 41:41.839
Well, my parents are expecting
a child soon... a boy preferably.

41:41.873 --> 41:43.608
So if you want to get on that
sexual position research

41:43.641 --> 41:45.978
- that would be fantastic.
- Jokes on you buddy,

41:46.011 --> 41:47.913
because I don't believe in
traditional gender roles.

41:47.946 --> 41:52.051
You're gonna get whatever it is.

41:52.084 --> 41:54.520
I hope it's a snake.

41:54.553 --> 41:56.255
I can't believe you fucked him.

41:56.288 --> 41:57.990
This like towel move, dude.

41:58.023 --> 42:00.059
You know he was totally naked
on purpose, right?

42:00.092 --> 42:01.860
I don't know, he seemed
genuinely unaware of it.

42:01.894 --> 42:03.929
Oh yeah, okay, so he was
watching My Dog Skip

42:03.962 --> 42:05.898
completely naked,
that makes sense.

42:05.931 --> 42:08.300
That's fucking weird, dude.

42:08.334 --> 42:10.937
Weird or totally cute?

42:10.970 --> 42:12.872
I don't know, it just depends
on the size of his erec...

42:12.906 --> 42:14.341
Knock it off!

42:14.374 --> 42:17.143
Oh, you are so gonna get it.

42:17.177 --> 42:18.878
Do you really think he did it
on purpose?

42:18.912 --> 42:21.281
Are you still drunk? Yes.

42:21.314 --> 42:22.916
Oh my god,
that changes everything.

42:22.949 --> 42:25.085
Yeah, things are definitely
gonna get awkward

42:25.118 --> 42:26.319
near the mailbox.

42:26.353 --> 42:27.587
What did I just say?

42:27.620 --> 42:28.955
Knock it off.

42:28.988 --> 42:30.323
You got five seconds, hot shot.

42:30.357 --> 42:32.592
One, two.

42:32.625 --> 42:35.162
Three... Yup,
that's what I thought.

42:35.196 --> 42:37.064
Is it okay with their parents
that you're doing this?

42:37.098 --> 42:38.566
They don't give a shit.

42:38.599 --> 42:40.668
- Look at them.
- Seriously, I don't know

42:40.701 --> 42:42.470
if the old lady's
gonna let me go, man.

42:42.503 --> 42:46.006
I'm at this stupid park
with my kids.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.942
I'm a goddamn saint.

42:47.975 --> 42:49.643
Yeah but you're not even
a babysitter.

42:49.677 --> 42:51.178
Listen, in love kids.

42:51.212 --> 42:53.347
I love them,
that's why I do this.

42:53.381 --> 42:55.383
I can't have any of my own.

42:55.416 --> 42:57.486
- You never told me that.
- Well, not medically.

42:57.519 --> 43:02.457
I just... I just
can't squeeze something

43:02.491 --> 43:04.993
the size of Peter Dinklage
out of my vagina.

43:05.026 --> 43:06.962
I'm sorry I just can't.

43:06.995 --> 43:08.230
I can definitely squeeze
something the size

43:08.263 --> 43:10.098
of Peter Dinklage in my vagina.

43:10.132 --> 43:12.200
- Eh.
- Eh, eh, eh.

43:12.234 --> 43:14.970
Eh, eh, yeah,

43:15.003 --> 43:18.440
Cause I could have Tyrion play
with my dragon eggs any day.

43:18.473 --> 43:20.308
Look, I come here
during my lunchbreak

43:20.342 --> 43:22.145
and pretend I have my own
because it's easy

43:22.178 --> 43:24.714
and it's oddly comforting.

43:24.747 --> 43:27.683
Have you ever considered
adoption maybe, or?

43:27.717 --> 43:29.285
Oh, god no.

43:29.318 --> 43:30.453
And deal with like dirty diapers

43:30.486 --> 43:31.721
and deep seeded adolescent
trauma?

43:31.754 --> 43:34.090
No, I'm just fine, I'm good.

43:34.123 --> 43:35.358
Hey!

43:35.391 --> 43:38.694
I'm always catching that one
trying to take girl's dolls.

43:38.728 --> 43:43.733
What if he really likes
playing with dolls.

43:43.766 --> 43:47.371
Oh shit, you know,
I didn't even think about that.

43:47.404 --> 43:51.442
I'm a horrible fake parent.

43:51.475 --> 43:54.111
So um, by the way, how are you?

43:54.144 --> 43:55.179
Being back and stuff.

43:55.212 --> 43:56.413
It's fine.

43:56.447 --> 43:57.981
I'm fine.

43:58.015 --> 44:00.017
Yeah? How's your mom?

44:00.050 --> 44:01.552
She's doing the best she can.

44:01.585 --> 44:03.687
I mean, we just really
didn't have a lot of time.

44:03.720 --> 44:05.756
We only found out a month ago.

44:05.789 --> 44:07.424
It's so fucked.

44:07.458 --> 44:09.494
So hey,
you want to hang out tonight?

44:09.527 --> 44:11.496
I don't know,
I have a PTA meeting.

44:11.529 --> 44:13.364
- What?
- It's a serious problem.

44:13.398 --> 44:15.300
Girl, yeah!

44:15.333 --> 44:16.768
You need to remember
you're still young.

44:16.801 --> 44:18.503
You need to be
your youthful self.

44:18.536 --> 44:21.406
My youthful self? Oh my god.

44:21.439 --> 44:23.775
I don't have a youthful self,
Harper.

44:23.808 --> 44:25.610
I work a stressful
nine to five job

44:25.643 --> 44:27.378
where I'm underappreciated.

44:27.412 --> 44:29.113
I can't find anyone in this town

44:29.147 --> 44:31.483
who isn't at least 75 percent
sociopath or a vegan.

44:31.516 --> 44:33.017
Hey, vegans are cool.

44:33.051 --> 44:36.322
Vegans fucking suck!

44:36.355 --> 44:38.324
But they have great baked goods.

44:38.357 --> 44:40.359
You know, I think I'm just gonna
be single my whole life.

44:40.392 --> 44:42.294
The only time that I am youthful

44:42.328 --> 44:45.264
is when I watch Stranger Things
with my dog in a onesie.

44:45.297 --> 44:47.566
Come on girl, you are great

44:47.600 --> 44:49.802
and you need to come
and hang with me.

44:49.836 --> 44:51.337
I've been on a two-day bender.

44:51.370 --> 44:52.805
I say we make
it a solid trilogy.

44:52.839 --> 44:54.139
Remember the times
that we didn't have schedules

44:54.173 --> 44:56.041
or plans or anything like that?

44:56.075 --> 44:58.245
- Yeah, I mean, it was awesome.
- It was awesome.

44:58.278 --> 44:59.646
Except for the part
where I had no money.

44:59.679 --> 45:01.181
Cheap thrills, bitch.

45:01.214 --> 45:02.415
Come on!

45:02.449 --> 45:04.351
- Ow.
- Come on!

45:04.384 --> 45:06.052
- Stop!
- Come on!

45:06.086 --> 45:07.754
Stop, okay, fine.

45:07.787 --> 45:09.322
I'll bring more brownies.

45:09.356 --> 45:11.424
You have magical brownies? Oh!

45:11.458 --> 45:12.759
Yeah my boss got them
for me last year

45:12.792 --> 45:15.161
when I went to Portland,
I didn't need them.

45:15.195 --> 45:17.430
How could you not need them?

45:17.464 --> 45:19.733
Haven't you been to Portland?

45:19.766 --> 45:22.270
Hey, you are so gonna get it.

45:22.303 --> 45:25.406
Hey... hold on a sec,
are you talking to my kid?

45:25.439 --> 45:27.208
Yeah because you're
on your fucking phone.

45:27.241 --> 45:29.845
- Mind your own business, lady.
- Wake up, daddio.

45:29.878 --> 45:32.280
This is my job,
I'm doing my job, okay.

45:32.313 --> 45:34.615
- I'm working stocks.
- Okay, well, congratulations

45:34.649 --> 45:37.084
on your stocks,
I'm watching your child,

45:37.118 --> 45:40.221
- I'll send you an invoice.
- I'm a doctor, okay?

45:40.254 --> 45:41.656
You're a doctor?

45:41.689 --> 45:45.360
I've met you so many times
outside Wholefoods.

45:45.394 --> 45:47.262
I think he's actually calling
the cops.

45:47.296 --> 45:49.665
- Okay well then let's just go.
- Okay, come on, no, no, no.

45:49.698 --> 45:50.867
Do you want me to grab
the blanket?

45:50.900 --> 45:53.836
It's not even mine, let's go.

45:53.870 --> 45:55.804
I'll see you man,
I'll bring a twelver.

46:02.277 --> 46:04.246
- Hey.
- Hi.

46:04.279 --> 46:07.115
How are you, uh, feeling?

46:07.149 --> 46:08.717
Feeling all right.

46:08.750 --> 46:10.520
Great, Jesus,
that's a lot of coupons.

46:10.553 --> 46:12.555
Nah, I know, I just...
I haven't had a chance

46:12.589 --> 46:14.557
to check it in a while.

46:16.192 --> 46:18.862
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

46:18.896 --> 46:21.431
So, what are you up to tonight?

46:28.738 --> 46:31.474
Not feeling so well,
I think I need to go upstairs

46:31.507 --> 46:32.843
- for a little bit.
- You okay?

46:32.876 --> 46:35.379
All of a sudden
not feeling too good.

46:37.181 --> 46:38.850
Not feeling good, like,
not like in a pregnant way,

46:38.883 --> 46:40.417
though, right, not like...?

46:40.451 --> 46:43.220
No, Paul.

46:43.253 --> 46:45.289
I'm just... okay, feel better.

46:45.322 --> 46:46.690
Fuck.

46:46.724 --> 46:48.860
Oh, shit, oh, this is not good.

47:00.538 --> 47:02.173
Mom, Mom.

47:03.675 --> 47:06.511
What do you mean you don't know
when he's coming home?

47:06.544 --> 47:07.779
Okay, but, Ma,
I'm sorry about calling,

47:07.812 --> 47:09.414
just never mind,

Great.

49:34.431 --> 49:36.400
Movie night.

49:36.433 --> 49:38.402
Ah, what are you watching?

49:38.435 --> 49:40.738
My Dog Skip.

49:44.441 --> 49:47.445
Um, the first half is great,

49:47.479 --> 49:49.781
and then it, uh...

49:49.815 --> 49:51.449
then it kinda tanks.

49:51.483 --> 49:52.852
Julie, ooh!

49:52.885 --> 49:55.487
You're a big fucking cooter.

49:55.520 --> 49:58.991
Hey, uh, slut?

49:59.025 --> 50:00.927
Uh, you feeling better, Harper?

50:00.960 --> 50:03.695
Shit, fuck.

50:03.728 --> 50:05.397
Feeling a lot better,
thank you so much,

50:05.430 --> 50:07.033
had an orange.

50:07.066 --> 50:09.903
- Get the fuck in here.
- Harper, what?

50:09.937 --> 50:11.839
- Come here.
- Oh, okay, nice meeting you.

50:14.507 --> 50:16.642
You too.

50:22.715 --> 50:24.684
- Not good.

50:26.452 --> 50:29.555
Did you know that kangaroos
have three vaginas?

50:29.589 --> 50:31.124
I learned it right there

50:31.158 --> 50:32.758
on the television.

50:32.792 --> 50:36.496
The church of our life, man.

50:36.530 --> 50:39.700
Yeah, that's... wild.

50:41.768 --> 50:44.438
Wild, that's such a good pun.

I am cogent.

50:57.819 --> 50:59.787
Drink this.

50:59.821 --> 51:00.956
Ugh.

51:00.990 --> 51:03.458
I'm waiting for this forever.

51:07.595 --> 51:09.098
This isn't vodka.

51:09.131 --> 51:10.900
Poor people vodka.

51:10.933 --> 51:12.667
- Water.
- You know, maybe we should

51:12.700 --> 51:14.702
- just hang out another night.
- No, no,

51:14.736 --> 51:16.205
because if we don't
hang tonight,

51:16.238 --> 51:18.140
then we won't watch
Girl With the Pearl Necklace,

51:18.173 --> 51:20.541
and then we won't watch
Scarlet do the little baby...

51:20.575 --> 51:22.879
- You're a little drunk.
- And you're a little bit

51:22.913 --> 51:25.681
of a bitch.

51:25.714 --> 51:27.683
What is going on, Harper?

51:27.716 --> 51:29.818
I'm fine, I barely even drank.

51:29.853 --> 51:31.922
Okay, well tell that to
the whiskey bottle right there.

51:34.124 --> 51:36.592
I'm fine, I barely even drank.

51:36.625 --> 51:38.161
Have you been drinking all day?

51:41.197 --> 51:42.564
Harper.

51:43.833 --> 51:45.202
Harper.

52:04.821 --> 52:06.623
I didn't know I had Qdoba.

52:08.758 --> 52:11.129
Round two, bitches!

52:12.830 --> 52:14.933
Oh, my God, let's get naked
and praise the moon.

52:14.967 --> 52:17.802
Woo, come on, girl!

52:17.836 --> 52:19.838
Scarlett Johansson!

52:21.873 --> 52:23.574
Woo, round two!

52:24.943 --> 52:26.878
Oh, come on, all right,
magical brownies.

52:26.912 --> 52:28.646
Did you bring the brownies?

52:28.679 --> 52:30.715
You know what, you really need
to just slow down.

52:30.748 --> 52:32.284
What are you talking about?
It's Friday.

52:32.317 --> 52:34.020
It's Saturday,
but that's besides the point.

52:34.053 --> 52:35.888
You need to
take it down a notch.

52:35.922 --> 52:38.224
Okay, thank you, Flanders.

52:38.257 --> 52:41.626
Okay, Harper, what is going on?

52:41.660 --> 52:43.296
- Nothing's going on.
- Really?

52:43.329 --> 52:45.264
- Yeah.
- By the looks of it,

52:45.298 --> 52:47.632
a lot is going on.

52:47.666 --> 52:49.801
- Okay, Dr. Phil.
- Great references.

52:49.836 --> 52:52.205
What is so funny?
I'm being serious.

52:52.238 --> 52:54.874
Oh, my God, I thought tonight
was girls' night, man.

52:54.907 --> 52:56.608
No rules, no schedules.

52:56.641 --> 52:59.279
I didn't realize I was
gonna get a fucking lecture.

52:59.313 --> 53:01.647
I'm not trying to lecture you,
I'm just trying to see

53:01.681 --> 53:03.816
- if you're okay.
- Why does everybody

53:03.851 --> 53:06.020
keep asking me if I'm okay?

53:06.053 --> 53:08.222
I'm fine! You know what,
if you want me to be something,

53:08.255 --> 53:10.190
you tell me what you want me
to be and I'll be it.

53:10.224 --> 53:12.592
Until then,
just shut the fuck up!

53:14.761 --> 53:16.529
Your father just passed away.

53:18.165 --> 53:19.832
Look, I get it.

53:19.867 --> 53:21.568
You can be any way you want,
I just don't want you

53:21.602 --> 53:23.872
to be destructive.

53:23.905 --> 53:25.874
You know what,
you're right, Julie.

53:25.907 --> 53:28.709
We just need to do this
another time.

53:28.742 --> 53:30.111
I'm standing right here

53:30.145 --> 53:32.713
if you need to talk.

53:32.746 --> 53:34.115
You just need to go, Julie.

53:34.149 --> 53:35.682
Just leave me alone.

53:37.886 --> 53:39.354
Okay.

53:39.387 --> 53:41.622
Just... I gotta be alone.

53:45.895 --> 53:47.595
Bye.

53:50.632 --> 53:53.903
Here, this'll help
with your hangover.

53:53.936 --> 53:56.272
Just eat one piece of one, okay?

53:56.305 --> 53:59.075
'Cause they're really powerful.

53:59.108 --> 54:02.845
You know if you need anything,
you can just call me, right?

54:02.878 --> 54:04.013
Mhm.

54:04.046 --> 54:06.748
Okay, thank you.

54:06.781 --> 54:08.852
Okay.

54:25.302 --> 54:28.371
...Woodpeckers that can be found
all around the world.

54:28.405 --> 54:31.707
It's so cool
how animals are fooled!

54:31.740 --> 54:34.045
Did you know that sharks
have no bones?

54:34.078 --> 54:36.813
- There's no bones about it.
- Are you an animal?

54:36.848 --> 54:38.950
You must be cool!

55:52.759 --> 55:55.129
Good luck with your
laser tag business, man.

55:55.162 --> 55:56.864
Thank you, bye.

55:59.166 --> 56:00.434
I love my job!

56:27.462 --> 56:28.964
There she is!

56:28.997 --> 56:30.966
Here I is.

56:30.999 --> 56:32.868
Harper, this is Christine,
Christine, this is Harper.

56:32.902 --> 56:34.070
- Hi.
- Hey, yeah, Dusty told me

56:34.103 --> 56:36.138
- all about you.
- Mm, he must've told you

56:36.172 --> 56:38.541
I have a tendency
to try to kill pretty ladies.

56:38.574 --> 56:39.976
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

56:42.245 --> 56:44.981
Uh, so Christine's a writer,

56:45.014 --> 56:47.483
- and super funny.
- Hm, writer.

56:47.516 --> 56:50.819
It pays the bills, yeah,
so I like it.

56:50.853 --> 56:54.156
Cool, do you write,
like, books or plays?

56:54.190 --> 56:56.792
Um, so I have a blog
that I am working on mostly,

56:56.826 --> 56:59.463
but I'm also
writing a children's book.

56:59.496 --> 57:01.265
It's about
the Spanish Inquisition,

57:01.298 --> 57:03.033
but you know, like,
for kids obviously.

57:03.066 --> 57:04.534
It's cool,
I think you'd like it.

57:04.568 --> 57:07.371
Neat, awesome, so there's
alcohol at this party, cool.

57:07.404 --> 57:08.538
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah, there is.

57:08.572 --> 57:11.375
Harper Lee!

57:11.408 --> 57:14.144
- Harper Lee!
- Oh, my God, Kyle,

57:14.177 --> 57:16.980
- what are you doing here?
- It's my friend's party.

57:17.014 --> 57:19.182
The agent, I invited Dusty.

57:19.216 --> 57:21.519
- Did you tell her?
- Oh, my God, wait,

57:21.552 --> 57:24.489
- tell me what?
- Uh, his friend's gonna rep me.

57:24.522 --> 57:27.325
What, really, wait, when, how?

57:27.358 --> 57:30.194
Kyle showed him some of
the clips from the live stream,

57:30.228 --> 57:32.930
- and fucking loved 'em.
- Oh, my God, that's amazing.

57:32.964 --> 57:34.866
- I know.
- My boy

57:34.899 --> 57:36.267
thinks he's the next Zala...

57:36.301 --> 57:38.403
Zach Galifianass.

57:38.436 --> 57:39.871
- Galifianakis.
- Yeah.

57:39.904 --> 57:41.472
He's flattering me,
no, it's just...

57:41.506 --> 57:43.508
it's not that big of a deal,
it's not that big of a deal.

57:43.541 --> 57:45.110
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you very much.

57:45.144 --> 57:48.113
- It's very cool.
- When you're as grown up,

57:48.147 --> 57:51.850
you're as growned up,
swingers, right?

57:51.884 --> 57:54.019
- Oh, right.
- Oh, my God!

57:54.053 --> 57:56.221
You know what we need to do?
We need to celebrate.

57:56.255 --> 57:58.457
You wanna do shots?
We should do some shots.

57:58.490 --> 58:00.859
No, I'm not drinking tonight.

58:00.893 --> 58:02.294
- Come on.
- No, I'm not drinking tonight.

58:02.328 --> 58:04.163
- Don't be a pussy, Dusty.
- Okay, well I'm not

58:04.196 --> 58:05.631
being a pussy,
last night I went too hard.

58:05.664 --> 58:08.500
Forget about you...
Rebecca, me, you.

58:08.535 --> 58:10.970
Christine... I got wine, I'm good.

58:11.004 --> 58:12.439
Thank you.

58:12.472 --> 58:15.275
Okay, Kyle, my man.

58:15.308 --> 58:17.010
Everybody's being
a bunch of party pussies.

58:17.043 --> 58:18.578
- You wanna drink with me?
- I'm giving you the...

58:18.611 --> 58:20.347
the arm of... of glory.

58:20.380 --> 58:22.582
You have my axe!

58:24.284 --> 58:26.119
Be safe!

58:29.556 --> 58:31.257
She's nice.

58:47.241 --> 58:49.944
Know what I mean?

58:49.977 --> 58:52.179
Nope.

58:52.213 --> 58:54.615
Crypto currency

58:54.648 --> 58:56.518
is... okay...

58:56.551 --> 58:58.520
okay, so there are
these book chains.

59:00.622 --> 59:03.291
Block chains, and, um,

59:03.325 --> 59:06.128
basically what it is
is that in the future

59:06.161 --> 59:08.597
you will be able
to do everything

59:08.630 --> 59:11.032
through your phone.

59:11.066 --> 59:13.235
Uh, don't we already use
our phones for everything?

59:17.506 --> 59:21.244
Yeah, but,

59:21.277 --> 59:23.246
block chains.

59:23.279 --> 59:25.114
Block chains.

59:25.148 --> 59:27.583
Excuse me, I'm gonna interject.

59:27.617 --> 59:29.152
Are you talking about
crypto currency?

59:29.185 --> 59:30.420
- Yeah.
- Oh, dude,

59:30.453 --> 59:32.054
- I just got into Space.
- No fucking way.

59:32.088 --> 59:33.289
Dude, I'll send you
some Ethereum.

59:33.322 --> 59:34.991
- Rad.
- What's your wallet address?

59:35.024 --> 59:36.626
- Do you have your QR code?
- No, it's all up in here, baby.

59:36.659 --> 59:38.327
- Whoa.
- Iron trap.

59:38.361 --> 59:40.096
I can just tell it to you,
you wanna write it down?

59:40.129 --> 59:41.497
Yeah, no, I have a good memory,
I'm an actor.

59:41.531 --> 59:43.166
- Perfect, all right, you ready?
- Yeah.

59:43.199 --> 59:45.269
- X, X, X...
- X, X, X...

59:45.302 --> 59:48.639
- ...3, 4, 7, 1...
- ...3, 4, 7, 1...

59:48.672 --> 59:50.340
- Upper case J.
- Upper case J.

59:50.374 --> 59:51.675
- Lower case J.
- Lower case J.

59:51.708 --> 59:53.377
Upper case J again.

1:00:01.418 --> 1:00:03.687
Okay, repeat everything I said
just back to me.

1:00:03.720 --> 1:00:05.122
- X.
- Okay.

1:00:05.155 --> 1:00:06.290

- Okay.

1:00:08.125 --> 1:00:10.995
- 1.
- Doesn't sound right.

1:00:11.029 --> 1:00:13.198
You have it
written down somewhere?

1:00:15.433 --> 1:00:17.435
I gotta call my wife.

1:00:19.737 --> 1:00:22.707
- How much you have in?
- I gotta call my wife!

1:00:22.740 --> 1:00:25.243
Dude, fuck.

1:00:25.276 --> 1:00:28.046
I don't even know what it is.

1:00:28.079 --> 1:00:30.014
Me either.

1:00:33.786 --> 1:00:35.120

or something?

1:00:35.154 --> 1:00:36.222
- They have that here?
- Okay.

1:00:36.255 --> 1:00:39.058

I just don't go to the zoo,
there's all sorts

1:01:24.639 --> 1:01:27.341

1:01:27.375 --> 1:01:30.211

I would buy your album, like...

1:02:09.552 --> 1:02:11.454

1:02:11.487 --> 1:02:12.789
Thank you.

1:02:12.822 --> 1:02:15.758
I wanna be a dancer.

1:02:15.792 --> 1:02:17.427
Like ballet, or...?

1:02:17.460 --> 1:02:19.295
- Hip-hop.
- No way.

1:02:19.329 --> 1:02:21.431
Seriously,
I even wrote my own raps

1:02:21.464 --> 1:02:24.233
from, like, 7th grade

1:02:24.267 --> 1:02:26.736
- until senior year.
- Oh, wow.

1:02:26.769 --> 1:02:29.372
I just love the art form.

1:02:29.405 --> 1:02:32.141
You know, it's like my, uh...

1:02:32.175 --> 1:02:35.212
- my dream.
- What about acting, though?

1:02:35.245 --> 1:02:38.682
Uh, guess I just kinda
fucking hate it right now.

1:02:38.716 --> 1:02:40.885
- No, you love it.
- No.

1:02:40.919 --> 1:02:42.519
You're doing so well right now.

1:02:42.553 --> 1:02:45.356
I really don't.

1:02:45.389 --> 1:02:47.625
I'm on a stupid fucking
ABC Family show.

1:02:47.658 --> 1:02:49.560
I have the same three lines
every episode.

1:02:49.593 --> 1:02:53.230
"Greg, I'm home!"

1:02:53.263 --> 1:02:56.568
Cue audience applause
that's fake.

1:02:56.601 --> 1:02:58.871
- Credits roll.
- What about the, um...

1:02:58.904 --> 1:03:00.572
what was it...
the drug addiction episode?

1:03:00.605 --> 1:03:02.307
Oh, my God, like,

1:03:02.340 --> 1:03:04.442
chopped onions, bawled
my eyes out, man.

1:03:06.979 --> 1:03:09.848
Okay, it did suck a big dick.

1:03:09.882 --> 1:03:13.752
A big old dickie!

1:03:13.785 --> 1:03:16.187
But, also gained me, like

1:03:16.221 --> 1:03:18.958
a big old checkie!

1:03:18.991 --> 1:03:21.227
Which is cool,
'cause I basically had nothing.

1:03:21.260 --> 1:03:22.828
I had my place.

1:03:22.862 --> 1:03:26.265
Just got some cool clothes,
cool beanie, but...

1:03:26.298 --> 1:03:27.566
- But what?
- I don't know.

1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:28.935

- But what?

1:03:31.370 --> 1:03:33.773
I just wanna, like...

1:03:33.806 --> 1:03:36.442
I wanna dance, hip-hop.

1:03:36.475 --> 1:03:40.479
I wanna, like, teach
underdeveloped kids.

1:03:40.513 --> 1:03:43.315
You know, like,

1:03:43.349 --> 1:03:45.218
give back something.

1:03:45.252 --> 1:03:46.653

You know what
you need to do now.

1:03:51.959 --> 1:03:53.928
No, I don't, what?

1:03:53.961 --> 1:03:56.898
I need you to dance

1:03:56.931 --> 1:03:58.465

1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:31.754
- I want, leave me alone!
- Clearly not.

1:07:31.787 --> 1:07:33.990
Yes, I can, you don't even
give a shit about me!

1:07:34.024 --> 1:07:35.258
- That's fucking bullshit!
- No, it's not!

1:07:35.292 --> 1:07:37.227
- I'm trying to fucking help you.
- You're the one that's

1:07:37.260 --> 1:07:39.062
- supposed to be helping me.
- I am fucking helping you

1:07:39.095 --> 1:07:41.164
- right now.
- With fucking Veronica Mars

1:07:41.197 --> 1:07:43.033
over there...
look at those fucking glasses.

1:07:43.066 --> 1:07:44.768
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

1:07:44.801 --> 1:07:46.237
- They're prescription.
- You don't even like her!

1:07:46.270 --> 1:07:48.039
- Leave her out of this, this...
- No, I won't!

1:07:48.072 --> 1:07:50.540
This is about you and you being
a fucking bitch right now!

1:07:50.573 --> 1:07:52.243
- You're being the asshole!
- You're a fucking asshole!

1:07:52.276 --> 1:07:54.011
You're supposed to be
having fun with me,

1:07:54.045 --> 1:07:56.180
and you're not doing anything
but hanging out with that girl!

1:07:56.213 --> 1:07:58.983
Everybody... everybody's trying
to fucking help you

1:07:59.016 --> 1:08:01.085
and you're being
a shithead to everyone!

1:08:01.118 --> 1:08:02.920
- Fuck you, fuck you!
- Fuck you, fuck you!

1:08:02.954 --> 1:08:05.789
You're supposed to know better,
you know that my dad died!

1:08:05.822 --> 1:08:08.026
My father is dead,

1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:10.095
and you don't give a shit.

1:08:10.128 --> 1:08:12.763
Nobody is ever here with me,
I'm alone!

1:08:12.797 --> 1:08:14.632
I am always laughing,
I am always fun,

1:08:14.665 --> 1:08:16.969
and it's like
I don't even have a voice!

1:08:19.537 --> 1:08:22.640
I'm sorry your father's dead.

1:08:28.213 --> 1:08:30.548
But now, this party's dead.

1:08:30.581 --> 1:08:32.018
Oh, fuck, sorry.

1:08:32.051 --> 1:08:34.753
Don't... no... I'm sorry...
no, no, no, no, yes, I am.

1:08:34.786 --> 1:08:36.889
- Damnit.
- Let me fucking smack you!

1:08:36.923 --> 1:08:38.958
- Let me slap you!
- I'm not gonna let you

1:08:38.992 --> 1:08:42.627
- hit me again, stop.
- She's got problems, dude.

1:08:42.661 --> 1:08:44.230
Stop, stop, stop.

1:08:44.263 --> 1:08:46.598
Stop, stop.

1:08:48.567 --> 1:08:51.204
Don't, please... sorry, everyone.

1:08:51.237 --> 1:08:52.771
Come on, I just need
to get some more whiskey.

1:08:52.804 --> 1:08:54.140
- Come on, let's get it.
- No, no, no, no, nope.

1:08:54.173 --> 1:08:56.143
- No, come on, come on, come on.
- No, I just need...

1:08:56.176 --> 1:08:57.844
- No, we're going.
- Let go of me!

1:08:57.878 --> 1:08:59.779
We're going, we're going.

1:08:59.812 --> 1:09:02.149
I just need some more whiskey.

1:09:02.182 --> 1:09:04.051
Don't slam the door.

1:09:16.629 --> 1:09:18.932
Heavy stuff, right?

1:09:18.966 --> 1:09:22.037
Yeah.

1:09:22.070 --> 1:09:23.804
You have any coke?

1:09:25.706 --> 1:09:27.841
Have you ever been
to the desert?

1:09:29.843 --> 1:09:32.646
I'm gonna take you home,
it's gonna be okay.

1:09:32.679 --> 1:09:35.250
- All right.
- Okay, I don't need your help.

1:09:37.052 --> 1:09:39.287
Oh, I need your help,
I'm gonna puke, hold my hair.

1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:40.821
Okay.

1:09:56.704 --> 1:09:58.640
Okay, yep.

1:10:04.380 --> 1:10:06.714
You're all right.

1:10:09.953 --> 1:10:11.922
It's okay.

1:10:19.930 --> 1:10:21.932
Come on, let's go.

1:10:21.965 --> 1:10:24.000
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

1:10:24.034 --> 1:10:25.335
Okay.

1:10:25.368 --> 1:10:27.037
I'm gonna drive you home,
girl, get up.

1:10:27.070 --> 1:10:29.072
Make your feet work,
make your legs work.

1:10:29.106 --> 1:10:30.273
All the way up, all the way.

1:10:32.110 --> 1:10:33.877
I got your purse.

1:11:49.123 --> 1:11:50.723
Ugh, fuck.

1:11:56.796 --> 1:11:59.233
So, what are you?

1:12:03.404 --> 1:12:05.838
I'm a comedian.

1:12:14.249 --> 1:12:16.318
What are... what are you?

1:12:16.351 --> 1:12:19.054
I save lives.

1:12:33.369 --> 1:12:35.404
Oh, yes.

1:12:40.409 --> 1:12:42.478
Mm.

1:12:45.982 --> 1:12:48.117
I thought Harper told me that
you were a dental hygienist.

1:12:48.150 --> 1:12:50.386
Just because I wear scrubs
that doesn't mean

1:12:50.419 --> 1:12:52.088
- I work for a dentist.
- Oh, because I always...

1:12:54.490 --> 1:12:55.993
Hey, hey!

1:12:56.026 --> 1:12:58.462
Morning, sunshine.

1:12:58.495 --> 1:13:00.998
Oh, wow.

1:13:01.031 --> 1:13:02.865
You look really bad.

1:13:02.899 --> 1:13:05.168
Pop a seat here,
let me make you a plate.

1:13:05.202 --> 1:13:07.371
- Alrighty.
- Good morning.

1:13:07.404 --> 1:13:09.439
I am off to work.

1:13:09.473 --> 1:13:11.141
On a Sunday?

1:13:11.174 --> 1:13:13.410
Yep, no rest for
the convalescent.

1:13:15.345 --> 1:13:17.547
Actually that's all they do.

1:13:17.581 --> 1:13:20.118
The eggs were okay,
thank you, Justin.

1:13:20.151 --> 1:13:23.087
- It's Dusty.
- Uh-huh.

1:13:23.121 --> 1:13:25.490
Finally met your ghost roommate.

1:13:29.093 --> 1:13:31.496
Roommate?

1:13:31.529 --> 1:13:34.365
But, I don't have a roommate.

1:13:34.399 --> 1:13:38.503
Whoa!

1:13:38.536 --> 1:13:40.204
No, but seriously,

1:13:40.238 --> 1:13:42.140
she is the worst.

1:13:42.173 --> 1:13:45.010
Yeah, yeah.

1:13:45.044 --> 1:13:46.844
Thank you.

1:13:48.614 --> 1:13:50.382
Hey, I hope you don't mind,
I had to, uh...

1:13:50.416 --> 1:13:53.118
I had to steal a sweatshirt
from you since you

1:13:53.152 --> 1:13:54.920
donked all over me last night.

1:13:54.953 --> 1:13:57.389
Ugh, God.

1:13:57.423 --> 1:13:59.525
I'm so sorry.

1:13:59.558 --> 1:14:02.094
- Don't worry about it.
- I feel so stupid.

1:14:02.127 --> 1:14:04.496
Ah, you're not stupid,
you just drink too much.

1:14:04.530 --> 1:14:06.365
It's not a big deal.

1:14:09.269 --> 1:14:11.204
My dad sent me a card
in the mail.

1:14:13.039 --> 1:14:15.375
Oh, God, it's so weird,
it's just from him.

1:14:15.408 --> 1:14:17.911
Probably the first card
I've ever gotten just from him.

1:14:17.944 --> 1:14:19.479
He must've sent it while he was
in the hospital or something,

1:14:19.512 --> 1:14:21.381
I don't know,
but I can't look at it.

1:14:23.216 --> 1:14:26.052
You haven't read it?

1:14:26.086 --> 1:14:27.921
No.

1:14:27.954 --> 1:14:30.889
I don't know, I... I can't do it.

1:14:30.924 --> 1:14:32.460
Oh, God, I have
so many memories of him

1:14:32.493 --> 1:14:34.528
from when I was a little kid.

1:14:34.562 --> 1:14:36.530
He'd just make me laugh.

1:14:36.564 --> 1:14:38.065
Whenever we'd leave
a restaurant,

1:14:38.099 --> 1:14:40.201
he'd grab toothpicks,
and shove 'em

1:14:40.234 --> 1:14:42.203
in between his teeth,
and so when we got in the car,

1:14:42.236 --> 1:14:44.538
he'd turn around and be like,
"Got anything in my teeth?"

1:14:46.307 --> 1:14:50.077
God, he was such a dork,
but I loved it.

1:14:50.111 --> 1:14:53.047
And then, time went on,
and Dad started going away

1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:55.984
a little bit more.

1:14:56.017 --> 1:14:57.986
And then, it was
replaced with comments

1:14:58.019 --> 1:15:00.255
about how I'm not good enough,
or smart enough,

1:15:00.288 --> 1:15:03.225
or thin enough
for any of that stuff.

1:15:05.260 --> 1:15:06.628
I thought it was just
gonna go on for a little bit,

1:15:06.661 --> 1:15:08.497
like he was in a bad mood
or something,

1:15:08.530 --> 1:15:10.298
but it went on for years.

1:15:11.700 --> 1:15:13.335
Pissed me off so much.

1:15:13.368 --> 1:15:15.570
Like all I did

1:15:15.604 --> 1:15:17.706
was try to make him smile,

1:15:17.739 --> 1:15:20.276
I'd try to make him laugh.

1:15:20.309 --> 1:15:24.547
Tried to make him proud of me.

1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:28.217
Nothing worked, so,

1:15:28.251 --> 1:15:30.386
I just said, "Fuck it,
it's not worth my time,

1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:33.256
I give up."

1:15:33.289 --> 1:15:35.024
Then, he got cancer.

1:15:37.293 --> 1:15:40.029
So, I flew home and all that.

1:15:40.062 --> 1:15:42.632
I was expecting the same person,
I was expecting that asshole

1:15:42.665 --> 1:15:45.102
that had been around
for so many years.

1:15:49.540 --> 1:15:52.443
And it was him again,
from when I was a little kid.

1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:59.450
He was telling jokes,
and having a good time,

1:15:59.483 --> 1:16:01.452
and giving us hugs,
and everything.

1:16:04.555 --> 1:16:06.457
It was everything I ever wanted.

1:16:12.096 --> 1:16:14.999
And then, he died.

1:16:15.033 --> 1:16:16.768
I can't open that letter
because if I do

1:16:16.801 --> 1:16:19.571
it's gonna remind me
of everything I was cheated.

1:16:21.606 --> 1:16:24.609
All that time, and for what?

1:16:24.642 --> 1:16:27.612
He's gone, and all I have
is a fucking card.

1:16:29.314 --> 1:16:31.750
Why would he do that?

1:16:31.784 --> 1:16:34.086
Maybe he was afraid, uh...

1:16:34.119 --> 1:16:35.588
Of his own daughter?

1:16:38.057 --> 1:16:40.125
Afraid of being powerless,

1:16:40.159 --> 1:16:43.195
or not living up to
his expectations or yours.

1:16:45.431 --> 1:16:48.567
Such a waste of fucking time.

1:16:48.601 --> 1:16:51.103
I can't live my life like that,
I won't do it.

1:16:51.136 --> 1:16:52.571
I would think...

1:16:52.605 --> 1:16:53.772
If that's the case, I think
you're gonna have to

1:16:53.806 --> 1:16:56.643
read that letter.

1:16:56.676 --> 1:16:58.411
Oh, God.

1:16:58.445 --> 1:16:59.746
Listen, I'm not saying you
have to go over there

1:16:59.779 --> 1:17:01.348
and open it right now.

1:17:01.381 --> 1:17:04.217
Do it whenever you feel ready,
honestly.

1:17:04.251 --> 1:17:07.621
But, the longer you let it
sit in that drawer,

1:17:07.654 --> 1:17:09.756
the longer it's just
gonna eat you up inside,

1:17:09.789 --> 1:17:13.226
and that's not fair to anyone,
especially not you.

1:17:13.260 --> 1:17:15.395
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

1:17:17.464 --> 1:17:19.500
Oh, my God, I smacked you,
didn't I?

1:17:19.534 --> 1:17:22.103
Yeah, pretty, pretty good, too.

1:17:22.136 --> 1:17:23.838
God, I smacked you so hard.

1:17:23.871 --> 1:17:26.440
- I'm so sorry.
- You kept swinging.

1:17:26.474 --> 1:17:29.176
- Oh, God.
- I actually typically have to

1:17:29.210 --> 1:17:31.712
pay women 50, 60 bucks
to get that kind of abuse,

1:17:31.746 --> 1:17:34.582
so I felt like
I came out on top of that deal.

1:17:34.615 --> 1:17:36.817
I know, that girl,
tell her I'm so sorry.

1:17:36.851 --> 1:17:39.520
- She was really, really nice.
- Veronica Rebecca?

1:17:39.554 --> 1:17:41.589
- Holy shit.
- Christine's already texted me.

1:17:41.622 --> 1:17:43.659
She's fine, she had
a couple hilarious jokes

1:17:43.692 --> 1:17:45.394
about last night, and so.

1:17:45.427 --> 1:17:48.764
- You were so mean.
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

1:17:51.366 --> 1:17:54.336
Hey, do you want my advice?

1:17:54.369 --> 1:17:56.171
Yeah.

1:17:56.204 --> 1:17:58.340
Please, go ahead.

1:17:58.373 --> 1:18:00.375
I think you should
take the day off,

1:18:00.409 --> 1:18:03.178
order some junk food,
a chicken-fried steak,

1:18:03.211 --> 1:18:05.881
fries, chili, cheese,

1:18:05.915 --> 1:18:07.650
anything that you could
think of,

1:18:07.684 --> 1:18:11.120
get under a blanket,
get a bunch of bad movies going.

1:18:11.154 --> 1:18:13.323
Yeah, we can watch
a bunch of kung fu movies.

1:18:13.356 --> 1:18:16.659
I think you're gonna
have to do it alone.

1:18:16.693 --> 1:18:19.862
You probably just need to
avoid some distractions,

1:18:19.896 --> 1:18:22.432
and just spend the day

1:18:22.465 --> 1:18:25.201
putting in some good energy,
reflecting on things,

1:18:25.234 --> 1:18:27.737
and taking care of
what you need to take care of.

1:18:27.770 --> 1:18:30.306
Then on Monday, you'll wake up
and you start doing

1:18:30.340 --> 1:18:32.343
what you just told me.

1:18:32.376 --> 1:18:34.178
What's that?

1:18:34.211 --> 1:18:35.813
Stop fucking wasting time.

1:18:39.216 --> 1:18:40.317
- Yeah, I'm right.
- Okay.

1:18:42.486 --> 1:18:44.388
You're right.

1:18:44.421 --> 1:18:47.291
Hey, um, I actually have to go.

1:18:47.324 --> 1:18:49.560
I have a deadline
for a spec pilot

1:18:49.593 --> 1:18:50.861
that I've been
putting off a little bit.

1:18:50.894 --> 1:18:52.830
Just hearing those words
come out of my mouth

1:18:52.863 --> 1:18:54.832
feels a little douchey,
so I apologize,

1:18:54.865 --> 1:18:57.335
- but, uh...
- I'm... I'm proud of you.

1:18:59.371 --> 1:19:02.507
Will you also wash my jeans?

1:19:02.540 --> 1:19:04.442
- Yes, sorry.
- You think an Uber will let me

1:19:04.476 --> 1:19:07.512
get into a car like this,
or is it too sexy?

1:19:07.545 --> 1:19:09.581
Wanna borrow
some of my leggings?

1:19:09.614 --> 1:19:11.483
Maybe.

1:19:11.516 --> 1:19:12.717
- All right, let's do this.
- Go get 'em, tiger.

1:19:12.751 --> 1:19:14.619
Yeah, let's do this.

- Okay.

1:19:22.595 --> 1:19:24.563
All right,
I'll talk to you Monday.

1:19:24.597 --> 1:19:25.898
- Okay.
- All right, bye.

1:19:25.932 --> 1:19:27.767

Hey, um, Kyle,
is this for a role?

1:21:56.621 --> 1:21:58.657
Because I need to put it
in your schedule today.

1:21:58.690 --> 1:22:01.127
I don't think I'm gonna
do this pilot anymore.

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:03.930
Why?

1:22:03.963 --> 1:22:07.600
What we talked about
on Saturday, and...

1:22:07.633 --> 1:22:11.004
I don't know
if you can notice, but,

1:22:11.038 --> 1:22:13.040
I've changed.

1:22:16.143 --> 1:22:19.612
There was a moment
in the desert

1:22:19.645 --> 1:22:23.382
as the sun rose in the east,

1:22:23.416 --> 1:22:26.419
an eagle flew

1:22:26.452 --> 1:22:29.923
across the horizon,

1:22:29.957 --> 1:22:32.826
landed right in front of me,

1:22:32.860 --> 1:22:36.697
looked me in the eye,

1:22:36.730 --> 1:22:39.600
told me I had a different path.

1:22:39.633 --> 1:22:43.403
- Talked to you?
- With its eyes, yes.

1:22:43.437 --> 1:22:46.140
What it'd say?

1:22:46.174 --> 1:22:48.675
It said I had to dance,
specifically hip-hop.

1:22:48.709 --> 1:22:49.978
That's great, I mean,

1:22:50.011 --> 1:22:52.679
what about the pilot, though?

1:22:52.713 --> 1:22:56.451
Uhh...

1:22:56.484 --> 1:22:58.120
I don't know how long
this crazy ride

1:22:58.153 --> 1:23:00.588
can go on, Harper.

1:23:00.622 --> 1:23:02.724
I never really wanted it...
I mean, no, I did,

1:23:02.757 --> 1:23:04.792
I really, really wanted it,
but now,

1:23:04.826 --> 1:23:07.629
just...

1:23:07.662 --> 1:23:09.697
I think deep down, I'm a...

1:23:15.004 --> 1:23:17.106
I'm just really sad.

1:23:19.142 --> 1:23:20.676
You can't be sad, man,
you're one of

1:23:20.709 --> 1:23:22.711
the most positive people I know.

1:23:26.515 --> 1:23:28.784
Do you know why I hired you
as my personal assistant?

1:23:30.719 --> 1:23:32.554
'Cause you needed to get a lot
of work done, and needed help.

1:23:32.588 --> 1:23:34.690
My agent asked to me
to hire a personal assistant

1:23:34.723 --> 1:23:37.994
to look more high profile.

1:23:38.028 --> 1:23:40.063
And I did it, because I, uh...

1:23:42.498 --> 1:23:44.467
Just needed a friend.

1:23:47.904 --> 1:23:50.740
Kyle Fairchild, I know,
must have just like

1:23:50.774 --> 1:23:54.111
a butt load of fucking friends,
but...

1:23:54.145 --> 1:23:55.912
I don't.

1:23:57.814 --> 1:24:01.185
It's not even my loft.

1:24:01.218 --> 1:24:03.820
It's an Airbnb.

1:24:03.853 --> 1:24:06.756
I'm sick of this.

1:24:06.790 --> 1:24:10.128
I miss my family back home.

1:24:10.162 --> 1:24:11.662
- Don't they live here?
- They're like

1:24:11.696 --> 1:24:13.831
always on vacation.

1:24:15.968 --> 1:24:19.171
Well, you know what?

1:24:19.204 --> 1:24:21.006
I am your friend, and I think

1:24:21.039 --> 1:24:23.908
you're gonna get
everything you want in life.

1:24:38.191 --> 1:24:41.194
Okay.

1:24:41.227 --> 1:24:43.895
- I'll do the pilot.
- Yay!

1:24:43.930 --> 1:24:45.530
I'm still gonna take
the dance classes

1:24:45.564 --> 1:24:47.566
- I signed up for.
- Well, that's perfect then,

1:24:47.599 --> 1:24:50.702
because this show might named
Untitled Rap Musical.

1:24:52.271 --> 1:24:55.009
The fuck out of here.

1:24:57.877 --> 1:24:59.947
- Eagle knew.
- Yeah.

1:24:59.980 --> 1:25:02.548
Yeah, it did.

1:25:02.582 --> 1:25:05.252
Hi, guys,
we're going to the theater.

1:25:05.285 --> 1:25:07.321
Okay, your laugh
looked really unnatural,

1:25:07.354 --> 1:25:09.056
so, like, let's try it again.

1:25:09.089 --> 1:25:11.691
Hi, guys,
so we're really excited,

1:25:11.724 --> 1:25:13.927
- 'cause we're going out tonight.
- Mhm.

1:25:13.961 --> 1:25:15.728
Which is so cool, right?

1:25:15.762 --> 1:25:17.031
- Everyone wants to do that...
- Oh, hey.

1:25:17.064 --> 1:25:18.564
Hey.

1:25:21.069 --> 1:25:23.238
Uh, this is Jen, my girlfriend
that I told you about.

1:25:23.271 --> 1:25:25.006
Oh, my gosh,
he's told me all about you.

1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:27.242
Oh, uh, the neighbor, right?

1:25:27.275 --> 1:25:28.909
Yeah, we borrow
each other's sugar

1:25:28.943 --> 1:25:31.346
- from time to time.
- Yeah.

1:25:31.379 --> 1:25:32.780
Oh, cool.

1:25:34.615 --> 1:25:36.884
Grocery day,
you're using those, uh, coupons?

1:25:36.917 --> 1:25:38.685
Yeah, um,

1:25:38.719 --> 1:25:40.221
just picking up stuff
for a juice cleanse,

1:25:40.255 --> 1:25:42.223
you know, typical LA bullshit.

1:25:42.257 --> 1:25:44.160
Not at all,
cleanses are really great.

1:25:44.193 --> 1:25:46.062
I mean, I do them all the time.

1:25:46.095 --> 1:25:48.064
They're really good for you.

1:25:48.097 --> 1:25:49.631
She says that.

1:25:49.664 --> 1:25:51.133
We're going to
the Greek Theater,

1:25:51.167 --> 1:25:52.767
- we're gonna see a show.
- Oh, cool.

1:25:52.801 --> 1:25:54.336
Yeah, Imaginary Dragons,
they're like

1:25:54.370 --> 1:25:57.605
the best metal band ever.

1:25:57.639 --> 1:25:59.707
- Well, have fun.
- Yeah.

1:25:59.741 --> 1:26:01.843
Aren't you
doing anything tonight?

1:26:01.876 --> 1:26:04.779
Uh, yeah, actually, um,

1:26:04.813 --> 1:26:06.714
- I am.
- Oh, awesome.

1:26:06.748 --> 1:26:08.318
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, too.

1:26:08.351 --> 1:26:11.054
- Okay.
- All right, have fun, guys.

1:26:11.088 --> 1:26:12.989
Bye.

1:26:15.358 --> 1:26:17.194
I think that
that worked kind of,

1:26:17.227 --> 1:26:19.930
but... but we got, like,
this weird kind of...

1:26:19.963 --> 1:26:22.698

I'm really just not digging.
