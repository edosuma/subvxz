WEBVTT

04:37.610 --> 04:38.361
- Hai.

05:47.138 --> 05:51.017
- Hai.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.811
- Gomen nasai.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.710
- Hai.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.589
What do you think?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.466
There's
a service entrance here,

09:52.550 --> 09:53.592
bartenders and stuff.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.344
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm thinking cozy.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.762
- Uh-huh.
- Like a living room.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.682
Like, flowers everywhere,
low booths.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.225
I've already bought
all the liquor.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.935
- How can you afford
all this?

10:03.019 --> 10:05.104
- What do you mean?
I save.

10:05.187 --> 10:08.441
I've been saving for, like,
two fucking years.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.985
The builders say
it'll be ready in a few months.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.361
- So it's happening, huh?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.238
- Yeah, it's happening.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.866
But I need to make a profit,
like, right away.

10:16.949 --> 10:20.202
So...I know I can
with the right team.

10:22.997 --> 10:26.751
- Sam, you know how much
I make at Onyx.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.878
Plus Duke kind of
leaves me alone, so...

10:28.961 --> 10:31.339
- But you know
that whatever we're making,

10:31.422 --> 10:32.757
Duke's making a shit ton more.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.010
And the sleazy owners.
I won't be a sleazy owner.

10:36.093 --> 10:38.554
How's this?

10:38.637 --> 10:41.182
I'll raise your weekly salary.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.060
Plus 25% of commissions
and upsells.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.898
Come on!

10:48.981 --> 10:51.859
This'll be ours.
I can't do this alone.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.699
- Look, Sam, I'm...I'm sorry.
Really.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.744
But a new business--
too much risk.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.329
- Too much--Luna, wait.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.457
- Look, Sam, if you want to be
a mama-san, just be a mama-san.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.001
- What is your problem?
- I am not judging.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.128
It's just--
- You're judging.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.466
- How does your boyfriend
fit into all this, huh?

11:15.549 --> 11:17.426
Isn't he Chihara-kai?

11:17.510 --> 11:18.260
You think he won't
expect his cut

11:18.344 --> 11:20.763
or take over completely?

11:20.846 --> 11:23.933
- No, we keep our work
and personal life separate.

11:24.016 --> 11:24.809
- Come on, Sam.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.436
You must know by now
that's impossible.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.772
- By now?
Am I missing something?

11:34.151 --> 11:36.529
- Okay, it's none
of my business.

11:36.612 --> 11:37.613
I'll see you tonight.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.638
Pol, where are you?

12:02.721 --> 12:04.682
Are you okay?
We miss you.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.475
We're feeling
your absence tonight.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.394
Can you get your hot Slavic ass
down here now?

12:34.420 --> 12:37.798
- What's new with the club?

12:37.882 --> 12:40.342
- Nothing.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.720
- What did Luna say?

12:42.803 --> 12:44.680
- Huh?
What do you mean?

12:47.766 --> 12:49.727
- You said
you'd offer her a job.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.313
- Oh.
Yeah.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.732
She said she'll think about it.
We'll see.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.867
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.622
Pol hasn't answered
her phone all day.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.540
She didn't show up to work.
I called Miralina

13:11.624 --> 13:13.167
and they said
that they haven't seen her

13:13.250 --> 13:15.377
since last week.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.297
- Maybe she wants to be alone.

13:19.173 --> 13:22.760
- Why?

13:22.843 --> 13:27.181
- Sometimes people need
time to think.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.773
- Mm, I don't know.
It's not like her.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.660
How's work?

13:47.743 --> 13:49.578
- Same.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.445
Shh.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.029
Hello?

17:11.113 --> 17:12.698
- Jake, it's getting harder
and harder

17:12.781 --> 17:14.241
to get a hold of you.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.618
Where are you?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.954
- I'm out
with a source right now.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.291
- Okay, listen, have you heard
anything about Tozawa

17:22.374 --> 17:23.625
being formally charged?

17:23.709 --> 17:25.961
- What?
No.

17:26.044 --> 17:29.339
- Something about Katagiri
having new evidence.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.341
- Evidence?
What evidence?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.635
- I don't know.
I'll ask around.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.638
Listen, you know the suspect
who was brought in yesterday

17:36.722 --> 17:38.057
on the Kaori Shoda murder?

17:38.140 --> 17:40.058
- Yes.
- I need you to go out

17:40.142 --> 17:41.977
to confirm the information
about the case.

17:42.060 --> 17:45.022
I think there's
a bigger story here

17:45.105 --> 17:46.398
connecting this case

17:46.482 --> 17:48.233
to the others
I've been tracking.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.985
- Okay, I'm on it.

17:50.068 --> 17:51.069
- Okay.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.851
- Josh?

18:22.935 --> 18:25.354
Josh Adelstein, is that you?

18:25.437 --> 18:27.606
Dave Fisch from Rockbridge.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.150
Dude, come here,
come here, come here.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.527
Oh, man.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.404
Whoa, you look different, man.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.198
- What are you doing here?

18:36.281 --> 18:39.493
- Seeing the sights.
Taking in Japan.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.452
What are you doing here?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.079
- I work here.

18:42.162 --> 18:42.746
- No shit?
Doing what?

18:42.830 --> 18:45.916
- For a Japanese newspaper.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.751
- Holy shit.
Seriously?

18:47.835 --> 18:50.629
That's amazing.
- I don't know.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.047
- Are you okay?
You look a little--

18:52.130 --> 18:53.006
- No, I just can't figure out

18:53.090 --> 18:55.467
if I'm having
a bad blowfish hallucination

18:55.551 --> 18:56.844
or if you're actually
standing in front of me.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.137
- Maybe this will clear
the cobwebs.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.569
Junior year, right?

19:13.652 --> 19:14.611
- Yeah, I was there.
- Right? Oh, my God.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.322
You are still the best
Frank Butler I've ever seen.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.909
- I gotta go.
I gotta get to work.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.911
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.
Wait, hold on.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.080
Let me get you my number.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.915
Call me tonight.
My hotel has a great bar.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.252
- Okay.
I might be busy working, okay?

19:30.335 --> 19:32.087
- Cool, cool.
Got it, got it, got it.

19:32.170 --> 19:35.090
- But it was great to see you.
- Great to see you, man.

19:35.173 --> 19:35.257
Go Bruins!

20:18.467 --> 20:21.929
- Whoa, I know Kung-fu.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.314
- Oi!

20:35.734 --> 20:36.735
- Hai.

21:22.572 --> 21:23.699
- So you really
haven't seen her

21:23.782 --> 21:25.534
since Friday morning?

21:25.617 --> 21:28.245
- Yeah. I caught her trying
to pack my Pradas for a trip.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.247
- A trip?
- Yeah.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.999
She was going away, right?

21:32.082 --> 21:35.252
- Going away?
With--with who? Where?

21:35.335 --> 21:37.212
- Look, aren't you guys, like,
best mates or something?

21:37.295 --> 21:39.548
Shouldn't you know?
- You live with her.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.717
- Barely.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.386
I just stop by long enough
to pack up some clothes,

21:44.469 --> 21:47.139
'cause my guy's a pilot, so--

21:47.222 --> 21:48.849
- Awesome.
- She's left all her stuff.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.267
She'll be coming back.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.144
- Where's Pol?

24:39.227 --> 24:41.146
- Who are we talking about?
- Polina.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.445
- Where the fuck is she?

24:48.528 --> 24:49.863
- You think I can keep track

24:49.946 --> 24:51.448
of every girl in love with me?

24:51.531 --> 24:53.074
- Well, I'm worried.
I haven't seen her

24:53.158 --> 24:55.327
in four days,
and you should be worried.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.370
Who's gonna pay
for your shit designer clothes?

25:14.846 --> 25:15.597
- Police said that she filed

25:15.680 --> 25:17.974
three complaints
against her boyfriend.

25:18.058 --> 25:20.894
All of them were filed,
none of them were followed up,

25:20.977 --> 25:21.853
and then he murdered her.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.606
- I see.

25:24.689 --> 25:25.440
- Put that together
with the other women,

25:25.523 --> 25:28.443
that paints
a really nasty picture.

25:28.526 --> 25:31.279
- Yes, each case I look into
fits a pattern.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.406
- The police ignore
warning signs

25:33.490 --> 25:35.617
and young women
are getting killed.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.036
This is front-page stuff.
Can you make deadline?

25:38.119 --> 25:41.331
- I think so.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.625
- Hey, have you heard anything
else about the Tozawa thing?

25:43.708 --> 25:46.127
- Honestly, Jake,
it's not a priority right now.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.380
I have to go.
- We just have to figure out

25:48.463 --> 25:50.090
if he got charged--

34:05.710 --> 34:06.961
- Mr. Marvin.

34:07.044 --> 34:08.212
Right, right, right,
right, right.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.131
He dropped
some serious knowledge on us.

34:10.214 --> 34:10.840
- There are things
that he taught me

34:10.923 --> 34:13.634
that I still use
at my job today.

34:13.718 --> 34:14.594
- Long time ago.
- We're getting old, man.

34:14.677 --> 34:16.596
Yeah.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.306
- Why'd you come to Japan?

34:18.389 --> 34:21.517
- Thought I'd take a year off
before grad school at Mizzou.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.020
You know,
get some life experience.

34:24.103 --> 34:27.815
And this place
has blown my mind, man.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.943
Yeah, I mean, Tokyo, right?
It's like--

34:31.027 --> 34:33.488
- Not Missouri.
- Not Missouri. Exactly.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.364
- And thank fuck for that.

34:35.448 --> 34:38.743
- Thank fuck for that.

34:38.826 --> 34:42.830
So how's your family?

34:42.914 --> 34:44.582
- I think they're good.
You know, I don't really have

34:44.665 --> 34:46.167
much time to check in
these days.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.419
I'm busy with work, but--
- Yeah.

34:48.503 --> 34:51.506
I heard that, like,
your sister was

34:51.589 --> 34:53.841
in the middle of some,
like, heavy treatments, right?

34:53.925 --> 34:56.219
- Who did you hear that from?

34:58.179 --> 35:01.265
- I just--I mean,
it's Columbia,

35:01.349 --> 35:02.433
so people talk, right?

35:02.517 --> 35:04.018
- People should keep their
fucking mouths shut

35:04.101 --> 35:05.937
about shit
they don't know about.

35:11.526 --> 35:12.652
Sorry. Jessica's fine.

35:12.735 --> 35:16.155
And we're keeping in touch

35:16.239 --> 35:21.035
and she's--she's better now.
She's healthy, so--

35:21.118 --> 35:22.036
- Good.
I'm glad to hear it.

35:30.753 --> 35:32.880
- Want to get out of here?

35:32.964 --> 35:34.382
Want to see
the coolest place in Tokyo?

35:34.465 --> 35:36.634
- Yeah.

35:52.859 --> 35:55.111
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.571
- Not bad, right?

35:56.654 --> 35:58.865
- Muy bueno, my man.
Muy fucking bueno.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.199
- You want to grab that booth
over there?

36:00.283 --> 36:01.158
I'll get a couple drinks.

36:01.242 --> 36:02.285
I'll meet you
on the dance floor.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.244
- Okay.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.411
- No bodyguard?

36:45.494 --> 36:46.329
- Do I need one?

36:49.206 --> 36:50.166
- I figured you were followed
everywhere you went.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.550
- I'll see you
on the dance floor.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.778
- Cheers.

37:31.248 --> 37:31.332
- Ne, ne, ne.

37:48.599 --> 37:48.975
- Hey.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.026
- Oi!

38:05.825 --> 38:07.910
- Baby, let him talk.

38:25.011 --> 38:28.055
- You fucking piece of shit.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.057
Who got her in that debt, huh?
It was you.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.392
- Hey.
- Motherfucker.

38:56.709 --> 39:00.004
- No. No.

39:00.087 --> 39:01.881
- Do you want to find out
what she knows or not?

39:06.177 --> 39:06.469
- Fuck.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.457
- Oi.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.937
- She's in Yoshino.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.438
- Where the hell is Yoshino?

42:04.521 --> 42:05.272
- Half a day from here
in the west.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.942
- When's she back?
- Soon.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.276
- Well, baby, go back
and ask when soon.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.612
Why are you running away
from me?

42:11.695 --> 42:14.740
- Do you know whose men are
in there right now?

42:14.823 --> 42:15.616
Tozawa's.

42:15.699 --> 42:17.868
You know how much trouble
I could get in

42:17.952 --> 42:20.955
for stirring things up?
- Baby, I am worried.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.456
- Don't treat me like a client.

42:22.539 --> 42:23.290
- I'm not.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.042
- You can barely look me
in the eye now.

42:25.125 --> 42:27.211
But when you need something,
I am your baby.

42:27.294 --> 42:29.004
- What are you talking about?

42:29.088 --> 42:32.216
- You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

42:32.299 --> 42:34.343
Nothing has been the same
since that night.

42:34.426 --> 42:37.054
You pull away
when I reach for you.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.556
- No, I don't.
- Don't lie.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.267
- I'm not lying.

42:41.350 --> 42:41.976
This isn't about us.
She's my best friend.

42:42.059 --> 42:44.853
- There is no us.

42:46.397 --> 42:47.982
I am Yakuza.

42:48.065 --> 42:49.984
Everything I do
has consequences.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.361
- Well, now this
is fucking interesting.

42:52.444 --> 42:54.321
Now you are making this
about us.

42:54.405 --> 42:56.657
So when you beat
the shit out of people

42:56.740 --> 42:58.742
for your boss, that's okay.

42:58.826 --> 43:01.328
That's--that's fine.
That's work.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.289
But when I need something,
when I need help,

43:03.372 --> 43:05.374
when it's for me,
there's consequences.

43:05.457 --> 43:07.459
Fuck you.
I thought you were different.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.461
You're not different.
You're a thug.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.672
- And what are you? Eh?

43:11.755 --> 43:14.216
Hiring girls to cheat
lonely men out of their salary?

43:14.300 --> 43:16.969
What do you call that?
A pimp?

43:17.052 --> 43:18.137
- Fuck you.

43:18.220 --> 43:19.221
I'm not forcing
anyone to do anything.

43:19.305 --> 43:22.099
- And no one forced Polina.

43:31.817 --> 43:34.028
This is a dangerous world.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.030
People get hurt.

43:36.113 --> 43:37.573
Sometimes they disappear.

43:40.284 --> 43:42.786
Maybe it's not for you.

44:14.360 --> 44:17.488
- This place is awesome, dude.

45:36.233 --> 45:37.776
- Ah.

46:34.625 --> 46:35.918
- Misaki...

46:50.641 --> 46:53.143
- What were you
doing before, though?

46:53.227 --> 46:55.896
- I was a model for a while.

46:58.482 --> 46:59.483
- I bet you were real good.

46:59.566 --> 47:02.819
- Flattery will
get you nowhere.

47:04.821 --> 47:09.785
- Is that how you two met?
When you were modeling?

47:09.868 --> 47:11.453
- You really think
I'm going to talk

47:11.537 --> 47:13.247
with you about him?

47:13.330 --> 47:14.540
- I'm just asking
about your life.

47:14.623 --> 47:17.584
I'm interested in you.
I want to know about you.

47:23.674 --> 47:27.135
- Let's just say he came along
at a time

47:27.219 --> 47:30.097
when modeling was becoming
less interesting to me.

47:30.180 --> 47:31.974
- Fair enough.

47:42.484 --> 47:43.610
Do you love him?

48:09.595 --> 48:13.265
- Hey, man, what's going on?

48:13.348 --> 48:14.641
Whoa, hey, get
your fucking hands off her.

48:14.725 --> 48:14.808
- Dave--Dave, don't--

48:24.568 --> 48:24.860
Onegaishimasu.

48:52.512 --> 48:54.139
- Shit--ah, shit,
are you all right?

48:54.222 --> 48:56.016
- Yeah, man, I'm fine.
- Fuck.

49:00.687 --> 49:02.606
- Come on.
Let's get out of here?

49:02.689 --> 49:03.732
- Yeah.

50:11.633 --> 50:13.093
The second to last
fucking page.

50:24.104 --> 50:27.190
You spelled it out beautifully.

50:27.274 --> 50:29.985
And that story would have
opened a lot of eyes

50:30.068 --> 50:32.654
if they hadn't
fucking buried it.

50:34.489 --> 50:36.992
- I'm glad you think so.
Maybe next time.

50:40.912 --> 50:41.788
- I don't know how you do it.

50:41.872 --> 50:45.959
'Cause I'm starting to not see

50:46.042 --> 50:48.128
the fucking point
of any of this anymore.

50:50.046 --> 50:53.759
- Jake, I do it
despite the indifference

50:53.842 --> 50:56.470
because somebody has
to tell the truth.

50:56.553 --> 51:00.474
Someone has to build a wall
of information brick by brick,

51:00.557 --> 51:01.808
story by story,

51:01.892 --> 51:05.771
until the facts
cannot be ignored.

51:05.854 --> 51:08.273
And then things have to change.

51:12.736 --> 51:17.491
Don't they?
- I don't know.

51:45.185 --> 51:47.062
- I need your help.
