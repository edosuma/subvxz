WEBVTT

00:11.846 --> 00:14.514
(clock ticking)

00:14.582 --> 00:17.651
So... what made you decide

00:17.719 --> 00:19.319
to give therapy a try, Ryan?

00:20.045 --> 00:22.913
Well, it wasn't
really my decision.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.576
My sister thinks I had
a nervous breakdown.

00:25.803 --> 00:27.240
I take it you don't see it
that way.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.938
No. It was just a bad reaction
to some sleep medication.

00:31.058 --> 00:33.155
Which she prescribed
for me, by the way.

00:33.275 --> 00:35.794
So you're doing this
for your sister?

00:35.862 --> 00:37.122
(sighs)

00:37.242 --> 00:39.631
She doesn't really take "no"
for an answer.

00:39.699 --> 00:41.543
She wants me to
work out my issues

00:41.663 --> 00:45.071
with our father before this big
family party she's planning

00:45.139 --> 00:46.939
for my nephew's first Christmas.

00:47.007 --> 00:49.675
Not that I'm planning
on being there.

00:49.743 --> 00:52.486
Okay. Well, for whatever reason
you're here,

00:52.759 --> 00:55.982
how about if we just...

00:56.049 --> 00:57.783
Ryan?

01:01.677 --> 01:03.857
Sorry. What were you saying?

01:05.525 --> 01:07.160
Is that your dog?

01:07.230 --> 01:08.831
I'm watching him for a neighbor.

01:08.899 --> 01:10.333
You know, dogs can be

01:10.400 --> 01:11.800
very therapeutic.

01:11.868 --> 01:13.936
Why don't you bring him in.

01:14.004 --> 01:15.504
It might help you to relax.

01:17.307 --> 01:21.177
Then when I was, what,
four years old,

01:21.244 --> 01:25.914
I suddenly started feeling
this rage inside me.

01:25.982 --> 01:28.784
I felt like I wasn't me.

01:28.851 --> 01:31.553
It got to the point where...

01:31.621 --> 01:33.555
And honestly,

01:33.623 --> 01:37.893
I felt like I wanted
to hurt someone.

01:40.763 --> 01:43.899
(voice breaks): And then,
it turns out in the end,

01:43.966 --> 01:48.736
it was just some kid
skateboarding past my yard.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.738
(sniffles)

01:52.874 --> 01:54.508
Whenever you're ready, Ryan.

01:54.576 --> 01:55.976
I'm sorry.
I don't really know

01:56.044 --> 01:57.177
what I'm supposed
to be talking about.

01:57.245 --> 01:58.645
You said you were here

01:58.713 --> 02:00.814
to work out some issues
with your father.

02:00.881 --> 02:02.949
There's nothing to work out.

02:03.017 --> 02:05.718
I already know
exactly who he is.

02:05.786 --> 02:09.521
He's controlling, he's devious,
he's Machiavellian.

02:09.590 --> 02:12.091
I really can't see a scenario

02:12.159 --> 02:14.026
in which talking about it's
gonna change that.

02:14.094 --> 02:15.762
Then when I was six,

02:15.829 --> 02:18.197
I developed an unhealthy
obsession with this bird

02:18.265 --> 02:21.534
until it flew away...

02:21.602 --> 02:23.604
some five seconds later.

02:23.671 --> 02:25.940
Sounds like you don't like him
very much.

02:26.007 --> 02:28.743
Did he do anything specific
to make you feel this way?

02:28.810 --> 02:30.177
(chuckles)

02:30.245 --> 02:32.313
I don't even know
where to start.

02:32.381 --> 02:33.848
Well, is there a memory
that stands out?

02:33.915 --> 02:35.249
Oh, by the way,

02:35.317 --> 02:37.885
it can be very comforting
to touch an animal

02:37.953 --> 02:40.822
while sharing your thoughts
in therapy.

02:40.889 --> 02:43.224
I'd like you to pet Wilfred now.

02:43.292 --> 02:44.759
Yeah, I don't think so.

02:44.827 --> 02:46.628
Ryan and I don't really do
the petting thing.

02:46.696 --> 02:47.896
I'm okay.

02:47.964 --> 02:49.431
Just give it a try.

02:49.498 --> 02:51.599
Don't.

02:51.667 --> 02:52.901
Don't you dare.

02:52.968 --> 02:55.670
Ryan, respect my space, please.

02:55.738 --> 02:57.706
I'm not even joking, dude.
I'm...

02:57.774 --> 02:59.908
Oh, wow. I always forget

02:59.976 --> 03:01.243
how heavenly
that actually does feel.

03:01.310 --> 03:03.979
Please, Ryan. Go ahead.

03:04.047 --> 03:07.716
I guess the memory that
stands out the most is

03:07.784 --> 03:11.387
the day he put my mother
in a mental institution.

03:13.190 --> 03:15.090
I was ten.

03:15.158 --> 03:19.261
After we dropped her off
and said good-bye,

03:19.329 --> 03:22.798
instead of, I don't know,
consoling us

03:22.866 --> 03:26.202
or doing something as a family,

03:26.269 --> 03:28.337
he took us back to the office.

03:28.405 --> 03:31.841
He just sat us down on
a couch with a Game Boy

03:31.908 --> 03:35.378
and some magazines
while he spent

03:35.446 --> 03:38.014
the rest of the afternoon
working.

03:38.082 --> 03:41.150
Like it was just another day
at the office.

03:43.087 --> 03:44.888
I still remember him yelling
at his secretary

03:44.955 --> 03:47.658
for some missing report
that he needed.

03:47.725 --> 03:49.927
Like he cared more about that
missing report

03:49.994 --> 03:52.729
than the fact that his own kids
had just lost their mother.

03:57.169 --> 04:00.905
Sorry, Jenna put some Frontline
on me this morning.

04:00.973 --> 04:02.573
Ryan, it seems to me

04:02.641 --> 04:04.108
that you're holding on

04:04.176 --> 04:05.856
to a lot of resentment
from your childhood.

04:07.179 --> 04:08.713
I'd like to tell you about

04:08.781 --> 04:11.550
a nontraditional method
of therapy called EMDR.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.319
EMDR?
EMDR?

04:13.386 --> 04:15.921
Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.791
It allows people to sort of
revisit their memories

04:18.858 --> 04:20.392
and reprocess traumatic events.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.195
Yeah. I-I don't really...

04:22.263 --> 04:24.130
Ryan,

04:24.198 --> 04:26.439
confronting memories like
the one you've just described--

04:26.500 --> 04:29.001
deeply, vividly
confronting them--

04:29.069 --> 04:31.236
can help you to let go
of whatever's burdening you,

04:31.304 --> 04:32.971
whatever's holding you back,

04:33.039 --> 04:35.207
so you can finally start
to move on.

04:39.178 --> 04:41.112
I wish Kristen would
get off my ass.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.847
I did not have a breakdown.

04:42.915 --> 04:45.196
Mate, you can lie to Kristen
and that doctor all you want;

04:45.250 --> 04:46.684
I saw what happened.

04:46.752 --> 04:48.786
You got to get past
these issues with your dad.

04:48.854 --> 04:51.889
Maybe you should give this
memory therapy thing a shot.

04:51.957 --> 04:53.190
Yeah, right.

04:53.258 --> 04:54.926
The last thing I need
right now is

04:54.993 --> 04:56.861
to relive moments from
my messed-up childhood.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.462
Wait, you're scared,
aren't you?

04:58.530 --> 05:00.865
Scared?
Of going back to that day

05:00.933 --> 05:03.334
in your dad's office
after your mom got put away.

05:03.402 --> 05:05.770
Ryan, you're an adult now.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.939
It may not be
as traumatic anymore.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.607
I'm not scared, Wilfred.

05:09.675 --> 05:11.643
You know, years ago,

05:11.711 --> 05:14.245
I found a muskrat skull
in the woods.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.681
Still had one eye.

05:15.748 --> 05:17.682
Really creeped me out.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.318
So, obviously, I buried it
in the yard for safekeeping

05:20.386 --> 05:22.120
with my other
cherished belongings.

05:22.188 --> 05:25.223
Years later, I felt
it was time to dig it up.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.392
I'll be honest, I was scared.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.993
I mean, this skull--

05:29.061 --> 05:32.364
I swear, I thought
I saw it blink once.

05:32.432 --> 05:36.134
But-but when I dug it up,
what I found...

05:36.202 --> 05:40.372
was a happy,
squeaky rubber bone.

05:40.439 --> 05:42.407
So you forgot
where you buried the skull.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.676
No. The way I see it is

05:44.744 --> 05:46.612
the skull was
never an actual skull.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.880
Yeah, you definitely forgot.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.715
The point is...

05:49.783 --> 05:52.485
things we bury in the past
are sometimes not as upsetting

05:52.553 --> 05:53.987
as we remember them.

05:54.055 --> 05:55.656
That's why you need
this therapy.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.057
Trust me on this.

05:57.125 --> 05:58.158
Why should I trust you?

05:58.226 --> 05:59.059
Why shouldn't you?

06:06.568 --> 06:10.404
I know we put that childhood
drawing to rest, but...

06:10.472 --> 06:14.007
I still don't have
any answers about what it means

06:14.075 --> 06:16.443
or what you are.

06:16.511 --> 06:19.346
Maybe that's what I should
talk to my therapist about.

06:19.413 --> 06:20.880
If you want him to send you

06:20.948 --> 06:22.468
straight to the loony bin,
be my guest.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.719
You're right.

06:27.787 --> 06:30.655
I can't just ignore this shit
with my dad anymore.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.557
Like I said, trust me on this.

06:32.625 --> 06:36.360
Always trust Wilfred.
A.T.W.

06:36.428 --> 06:38.195
That's why we wear
these wristbands,

06:38.263 --> 06:40.797
to constantly remind
ourselves of that.

06:40.865 --> 06:43.533
Wait, what did you do
with yours?

06:45.770 --> 06:47.537
These are the pulsers
I described to you.

06:47.605 --> 06:48.905
And as we discussed,

06:48.973 --> 06:51.108
I'd like you to take
one in each hand

06:51.176 --> 06:52.910
and concentrate
on the vibrations

06:52.978 --> 06:54.411
being emitted through them.

06:54.479 --> 06:56.547
They'll help you
focus and relax.

06:58.350 --> 07:02.153
(pulsers vibrating steadily)

07:02.220 --> 07:04.455
Now I want you to
close your eyes...

07:04.523 --> 07:06.591
and we'll begin.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.629
<i>I want you to think back</i>
<i>to the day</i>

07:10.697 --> 07:13.299
<i>your father placed your mother</i>
<i>in an institution.</i>

07:13.366 --> 07:15.134
<i>Tell me what you see.</i>

07:15.202 --> 07:18.371
RYAN: <i>Whoa. I see my mother</i>
<i>being committed.</i>

07:18.439 --> 07:19.872
Get in the car.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.975
<i>There's Kristen.</i>

07:24.346 --> 07:25.880
DOCTOR:
<i>Where are you now, Ryan?</i>

07:25.947 --> 07:28.315
RYAN:
<i>I'm in my father's office.</i>

07:28.383 --> 07:30.484
<i>This is right after</i>
<i>we left my mother.</i>

07:32.621 --> 07:36.023
<i>I'm playing my Game Boy.</i>

07:36.091 --> 07:37.992
<i>God, everything's so vivid.</i>

07:38.060 --> 07:39.627
Psst! Psst!

07:39.695 --> 07:41.762
RYAN: Wilfred?
What are you doing here?

07:41.830 --> 07:43.531
Shh!

07:43.599 --> 07:45.066
I'm not Wilfred.

07:45.134 --> 07:46.967
I'm a creation of your mind,

07:47.035 --> 07:49.870
and I'm here to deliver a very
important message to you:

07:49.938 --> 07:52.253
Don't trust Wilfred.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.683
I'm telling you, Wilfred is
up to something, mate,

07:55.691 --> 07:57.525
which is why you need to....
DOCTOR: <i>Ryan,</i>

07:57.593 --> 07:59.661
<i>I seem to have lost you.</i>

07:59.729 --> 08:02.492
<i>Can you describe to me</i>
<i>what's happening?</i>

08:06.430 --> 08:09.432
RYAN (over phonograph):
I'm still in my father's office.

08:09.499 --> 08:12.468
I'm pretending to focus on my
Game Boy, but I'm actually...

08:12.536 --> 08:14.303
We can talk freely now.

08:14.371 --> 08:17.173
RYAN: Okay, I have no idea
what's going on.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.375
You said you're a creation
of my mind?

08:19.443 --> 08:22.044
Your subconscious often feels
the need to express things

08:22.112 --> 08:25.614
to you in familiar,
accessible representations.

08:25.682 --> 08:27.316
Like that guy over there.

08:27.384 --> 08:29.051
What's up, Ryan?

08:29.119 --> 08:30.653
RYAN:
Who the hell is that?

08:30.721 --> 08:32.361
That's the part of your brain
that worries

08:32.389 --> 08:33.956
about the parking meter.

08:34.024 --> 08:36.091
Look, I mean,
I don't want to be that guy,

08:36.159 --> 08:38.193
but you only have 17 minutes
left on your meter.

08:38.260 --> 08:39.628
Personally? Me?

08:39.696 --> 08:41.163
I'm kind of freaking out here!

08:41.231 --> 08:43.032
RYAN: And your purpose
is to tell me

08:43.100 --> 08:45.067
that I'm not supposed
to trust Wilfred?

08:45.135 --> 08:48.171
Never trust Wilfred. N.T.W.

08:48.238 --> 08:50.306
That's why I wear
this bracelet, to...

08:50.374 --> 08:52.808
Constantly remind yourself
of that. <i>I got it.</i>

08:52.876 --> 08:54.943
Here's yours, by the way.

08:55.011 --> 08:58.046
But wait,
why should I trust you?

08:59.749 --> 09:02.117
Where are we going?

09:05.621 --> 09:08.255
Oh, God.

09:08.323 --> 09:09.523
Dude, what are you doing?

09:09.591 --> 09:11.458
Nothing. I just...

09:11.526 --> 09:13.961
KRISTEN: Ryan, let's go!
School starts in 20 minutes!

09:14.029 --> 09:15.663
Are you drawing on pubic hairs?

09:15.731 --> 09:17.231
I was a late bloomer.

09:17.299 --> 09:18.900
What am I, a freshman
in high school?

09:18.968 --> 09:20.502
Why are we even here?

09:20.569 --> 09:22.671
Shit, we must have taken
a wrong turn.

09:22.738 --> 09:25.239
Okay, um,
freshman year memories.

09:25.307 --> 09:26.674
There we are.

09:26.742 --> 09:28.943
I think we were meant
to take a left

09:29.011 --> 09:30.491
after the
Hootie & the Blowfish years.

09:30.546 --> 09:32.047
Come on.
G-Get us out of here!

09:32.115 --> 09:34.249
KRISTEN:
I said, let's go!

09:34.317 --> 09:37.418
RYAN: This is the day
I drew the drawing.

09:37.486 --> 09:40.655
I must be... <i>six years old.</i>

09:40.723 --> 09:43.891
(chuckles) God, I forgot
about those shoes.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.659
I actually thought
Reebok Pumps were cool.

09:45.727 --> 09:46.893
WILFRED:
Were?!

09:46.961 --> 09:48.929
Reebok Pumps are the shit!

09:48.996 --> 09:50.630
L-Look, this is
all fascinating,

09:50.698 --> 09:53.032
but I came here to deal with
my father issues.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.867
This drawing created friction

09:54.935 --> 09:57.504
between you and Wilfred,
didn't it?

09:57.571 --> 10:00.139
He told you you'd find answers
in good time.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.242
And you trusted him.

10:03.310 --> 10:04.777
So what?

10:04.845 --> 10:06.780
Was he hiding information
from me?

10:06.847 --> 10:09.283
Did he burn the drawing for
some secret, selfish reason?

10:09.350 --> 10:10.951
Maybe, I don't know.

10:11.019 --> 10:12.953
But coming here
doesn't prove anything.

10:13.021 --> 10:16.657
He burned it in...
the basement.

10:16.725 --> 10:19.860
Did he really burn it though?

10:19.928 --> 10:22.129
Or did he switch it
at the last second,

10:22.197 --> 10:25.465
and burn a blank piece of paper?

10:25.533 --> 10:27.267
DOCTOR:
That's enough for today.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.371
We'll pick this up
at our next session.

10:34.142 --> 10:35.976
(upbeat dance music playing)

10:45.120 --> 10:46.921
(music stops)
Ryan, you're back.

10:46.989 --> 10:48.356
Well, how was the therapy?

10:48.423 --> 10:49.958
I have so many questions
about your childhood,

10:50.025 --> 10:51.659
I don't even know
where to start.

10:51.727 --> 10:54.095
Like, what was on the floor
of your dad's office?

10:54.162 --> 10:55.329
Cookie crumbs?

10:55.397 --> 10:56.931
Spaghetti sauce droplets?

10:56.998 --> 10:58.665
I don't know what to tell you.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.634
The EMDR thing
didn't really work.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.235
Aw.

11:02.303 --> 11:04.204
Well, that's a shame, mate.
Yeah.

11:04.271 --> 11:07.206
Well, Dr. Blum seems to think
if I bring a memento

11:07.274 --> 11:09.908
from my childhood,
like a photo or a drawing,

11:09.976 --> 11:11.644
that it might trigger something.

11:11.711 --> 11:14.547
Like your old
belly-smacking bat?

11:14.614 --> 11:16.282
I've told you a thousand times,

11:16.350 --> 11:18.084
that's my Wiffle Ball bat.

11:18.152 --> 11:19.419
Agree to disagree.

11:19.486 --> 11:20.887
Okay, and would you
stop doing that?

11:20.955 --> 11:22.222
That shit's getting really old.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.792
Even when I do
the monster truck rally voice?

11:24.859 --> 11:27.862
Especially when you do the
monster truck rally voice.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.764
Ow!

11:29.832 --> 11:32.267
You got smacked!

11:32.334 --> 11:34.969
Okay, I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

11:35.037 --> 11:36.637
I know you didn't
burn the drawing.

11:36.705 --> 11:38.072
What? Of course I did.

11:38.140 --> 11:39.507
You saw me do it.
Oh, really?

11:39.575 --> 11:41.175
Well, then how come I found it

11:41.243 --> 11:42.877
when I was digging around
in the yard the other day?

11:42.945 --> 11:45.046
Damn! How did you find it?

11:45.114 --> 11:46.648
I didn't.

11:46.716 --> 11:49.651
But I figured you buried
it like you always do.

11:49.719 --> 11:51.386
W-Wait, so you were bluffing?

11:52.789 --> 11:54.589
But how could you
possibly deduce

11:54.657 --> 11:56.057
that I bury
all my cherished belongings

11:56.125 --> 11:58.226
like my creepy muskrat skull?

11:58.294 --> 12:00.261
Shit!

12:00.329 --> 12:01.997
I just want to know why
you buried the drawing.

12:02.064 --> 12:04.266
I can't quite explain why.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.301
All I know is I had
a visceral feeling

12:06.369 --> 12:08.803
that it was
too important to burn.

12:08.871 --> 12:10.272
You're lying.
I'm not.

12:10.339 --> 12:13.408
Look, if I could just
prove it to you, I...

12:13.476 --> 12:16.077
Ryan, the next time you do
that memory therapy,

12:16.145 --> 12:18.379
try to go back to the day
you drew the drawing,

12:18.447 --> 12:20.381
and you'll see I'm not
keeping any secrets from you.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.649
Yeah.

12:21.717 --> 12:24.319
Well, I-I guess
I could, but...

12:24.386 --> 12:27.155
Wait, don't tell me,
you already went back there?

12:27.222 --> 12:29.657
Sort of. It all
happened so fast.

12:29.725 --> 12:31.693
And you didn't even think
to check if I was there?

12:31.760 --> 12:32.794
You idiot!

12:32.861 --> 12:36.463
Ow!
You got smacked!

12:36.531 --> 12:40.034
Look, mate, this is our chance
to finally learn the truth.

12:40.101 --> 12:42.603
You've got to go back there.

12:44.506 --> 12:46.507
Before we begin,

12:46.575 --> 12:48.442
I want to remind you
to stay focused.

12:48.510 --> 12:50.644
Last time,

12:50.712 --> 12:52.880
you got to the point where you
were basically just repeating

12:52.948 --> 12:55.783
the same sentence over and over,
almost like a skipping record.

12:55.851 --> 12:58.153
Oh, sorry about that.

12:58.220 --> 13:00.555
It's okay.

13:02.391 --> 13:05.627
(pulsers vibrating steadily)

13:05.695 --> 13:08.164
Now just relax

13:08.231 --> 13:10.433
and focus on the vibrations.

13:10.501 --> 13:12.736
Now, close your eyes.

13:15.506 --> 13:18.175
<i>I want you to revisit</i>
<i>that memory of your father</i>

13:18.242 --> 13:20.577
<i>and tell me what you see.</i>

13:20.645 --> 13:23.046
RYAN (over phonograph): I'm back
in my dad's office again.

13:23.114 --> 13:24.882
Kristen is
still sitting next to me.

13:24.949 --> 13:27.318
I notice a plant
on the table...

13:32.357 --> 13:34.158
RYAN:
Wilfred?

13:37.963 --> 13:38.830
Wilfred!

13:42.835 --> 13:44.268
Wilfred, stop!

13:47.906 --> 13:51.276
Why are you running from me?

13:52.845 --> 13:55.079
Stop!

13:55.146 --> 13:57.014
Wilfred!

13:58.817 --> 14:01.151
Wilfred! Wilfred?

14:01.219 --> 14:02.820
Wait, is that a spaceship?

14:02.887 --> 14:04.922
Hey, buddy.

14:04.990 --> 14:07.792
I sure did have a lot of fun
hanging out with you.

14:07.859 --> 14:10.161
Thanks for showing me
your planet.

14:10.228 --> 14:13.130
But now it's time for me
to return to my home planet.

14:13.198 --> 14:14.799
Wait, you're an alien?

14:14.866 --> 14:16.967
I'm gonna miss you,
little fella.

14:21.439 --> 14:23.640
RYAN: I don't understand.
How could I not remember this?

14:23.694 --> 14:26.043
I'll be back in a couple
of human decades, kiddo.

14:26.819 --> 14:29.288
And most importantly,

14:29.356 --> 14:33.593
don't let anyone tell you to
stop wearing those Reebok Pumps.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.027
They're cool.

14:35.095 --> 14:36.228
Trust me.

14:36.296 --> 14:38.264
Wait, did this actually happen?

14:38.332 --> 14:40.633
Hurry back home now.

14:40.701 --> 14:43.103
If you stay any longer,
you'll probably start to cry.

14:43.170 --> 14:45.538
Good-bye, Ryan.
I'll miss you.

14:45.606 --> 14:47.840
Just go back out the door
you came in.

14:47.908 --> 14:51.143
Bye-bye.

14:51.211 --> 14:53.413
Uh, yeah, don't worry
about that.

14:53.480 --> 14:57.050
Uh, that's just our launching,
uh, thing-thingie...

14:57.118 --> 14:59.019
Is that spaceship fake?

14:59.086 --> 15:00.553
Just go, dude! Leave!

15:00.621 --> 15:01.921
Wait!

15:01.989 --> 15:03.189
You!

15:03.257 --> 15:04.490
You created this memory.

15:04.558 --> 15:06.393
Why would you do this?

15:06.460 --> 15:08.061
The real question is:
why did you do it?

15:08.129 --> 15:09.429
You're trying to trick me.

15:09.497 --> 15:10.830
You're the one
I shouldn't trust.

15:10.898 --> 15:12.866
I'm a creation
of your mind, mate.

15:12.934 --> 15:15.836
How could I do something
without you making me do it?

15:15.904 --> 15:17.805
So why did you do it?
I don't know.

15:17.872 --> 15:19.974
Just say it!
Just say what?

15:20.041 --> 15:21.242
You've been
distracting yourself!

15:21.309 --> 15:23.344
What are you running away from?!

15:23.412 --> 15:25.947
The memory in my father's office!
But why?!

15:26.015 --> 15:28.750
Because I just don't want
to go back there, okay?

15:28.817 --> 15:31.119
It'll hurt too much.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.028
Come in.

15:39.095 --> 15:41.931
Sorry to bother you,
Mr. Newman.

15:41.999 --> 15:45.401
I just wanted to check in and
see how you were holding up.

15:45.469 --> 15:47.870
Excuse me?

15:47.938 --> 15:50.006
Oh, I'm sorry, I just thought

15:50.073 --> 15:51.741
today must have been
difficult for you.

15:51.808 --> 15:54.010
You want to know what's
difficult for me, Genevieve?

15:54.077 --> 15:56.379
Understanding how in God's name

15:56.447 --> 15:58.381
I hired someone as
incompetent as you!

15:58.449 --> 16:01.017
I've asked you three times
to find the transcript

16:01.085 --> 16:03.219
for the Enright deposition.
I'm so sorry, sir.

16:03.287 --> 16:04.954
Just get the
goddamn deposition!

16:05.022 --> 16:06.489
Yes, sir.

16:06.557 --> 16:08.858
RYAN:
<i>God, he's so angry.</i>

16:08.926 --> 16:11.728
Kristen, take your
brother to the lobby.

16:11.795 --> 16:13.930
I have a meeting
in a few minutes.

16:28.379 --> 16:30.280
(sobbing)

16:30.348 --> 16:32.516
<i>Is he... is he crying?</i>

16:32.583 --> 16:34.785
<i>He never cried.</i>

16:45.530 --> 16:47.565
So how do you feel?

16:51.036 --> 16:53.771
I feel better.

16:53.839 --> 16:56.741
That's wonderful, Ryan.

16:56.808 --> 17:00.277
Now, before we end
our session today,

17:00.345 --> 17:01.779
I-I'd like to talk
to you about

17:01.847 --> 17:03.287
some things you said
during the EMDR.

17:03.348 --> 17:05.816
Specifically, your memory of,

17:05.884 --> 17:07.218
and I quote, (clears throat)

17:07.286 --> 17:09.353
"the beast with
four Matt Damon heads

17:09.421 --> 17:11.188
"who fellated you one night,

17:11.256 --> 17:13.023
"each head performing
a different,

17:13.090 --> 17:15.925
specific, oral task."

17:23.367 --> 17:26.037
Unfortunately,
I didn't learn anything new

17:26.105 --> 17:28.039
about you or the drawing.

17:28.107 --> 17:31.243
But... I did learn a lot
about my father.

17:31.310 --> 17:34.045
WILFRED: Your therapy experience
sounds inspirational, mate.

17:34.113 --> 17:36.347
In fact, it even
taught me a few things.

17:36.415 --> 17:38.316
Cool. Hey, also...

17:38.384 --> 17:40.519
WILFRED (over recorder): Stop,
you're not that short, mate.

17:40.587 --> 17:41.887
What?
No, thanks.

17:41.955 --> 17:44.123
Let's order Indian food tonight.

17:44.190 --> 17:48.247
Have you not been listening
to me this entire time?

17:48.495 --> 17:50.863
(over recorder): What? Of course
I've been listening to you

17:50.931 --> 17:53.165
this entire time.

17:57.769 --> 18:01.638
Come on, you must be
good at something.

18:01.706 --> 18:05.008
Well, there is this one thing.

18:05.075 --> 18:06.742
No, it's-it's too embarrassing.

18:06.810 --> 18:09.111
Come on. I promise
I won't laugh.

18:11.248 --> 18:12.682
Okay.

18:12.749 --> 18:14.550
(laughs):
I can't believe I'm doing this.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.502
(smacks lips)

18:33.570 --> 18:35.905
Wow, that's great.

18:35.973 --> 18:37.073
Really?

18:37.141 --> 18:38.108
No.

18:38.175 --> 18:39.809
It's disgusting.

18:39.877 --> 18:42.778
You-you put your slimy,
erect penis on your lips.

18:42.846 --> 18:45.781
And-and that-- I-I can
only assume it's blood.

18:45.849 --> 18:47.116
Shit, you're right.

18:47.184 --> 18:48.684
That's demented.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.219
Don't tell anyone I did that.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.502
(sighs):
Ah... ah.

19:09.306 --> 19:10.907
Don't eat that.

19:10.974 --> 19:13.409
It's got chocolate in it?
Yes.

19:13.477 --> 19:15.277
It's got raisins in it, too?

19:15.345 --> 19:17.680
Yes, and both are
poison to dogs.

19:17.747 --> 19:21.083
And that-- is it mold on it,
growing there?

19:21.150 --> 19:24.185
And if I eat it,
it'll make me sick, right?

19:24.253 --> 19:25.787
Right. Exactly.

19:25.854 --> 19:27.989
Thanks for the heads-up.

19:28.057 --> 19:29.925
You're welcome.

19:38.502 --> 19:40.870
Better take me to the vet.
