Me.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.099
That could easily have been planted.

39:22.277 --> 39:26.065
You said the name "Masha Rostova" had
been lost to history until the manhunt.

39:26.239 --> 39:28.855
Now it's out there,
and someone's looking for me.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.024
It's my mother.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.194
Who else would care? Who?

39:38.334 --> 39:40.165
You were right.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.452
Some things can't be forgiven.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.244
Hey.

40:23.379 --> 40:24.915
Hey.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.755
How was your day?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.712
It was, uh, busy.

40:30.511 --> 40:33.639
Spent it telling anyone
who'd listen how much I love you.

40:36.476 --> 40:40.219
J‘ l'll spend the day J‘

40:41.147 --> 40:43.889
J‘ In my own way J‘

40:44.567 --> 40:46.068
It's me.

40:46.235 --> 40:47.566
He came.

40:47.737 --> 40:50.149
Just like you said he would.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.030
How do you want me to handle it?

40:53.451 --> 40:57.239
J‘ I'm only human J‘J‘

40:59.457 --> 41:02.073
RAYMOND:
This is above and beyond, my friend.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.503
Above and beyond.

41:04.671 --> 41:07.504
[GRUNTS AND GASPS]

41:08.716 --> 41:10.047
IS that it?

41:12.220 --> 41:15.087
If anything happened to me,
this was to go to Elizabeth.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.219
So She'd know.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.643
Now I'm not sure
I ever want her to know.

41:22.814 --> 41:26.352
Perhaps, Raymond,
in this case, what you want is irrelevant.

41:26.734 --> 41:30.773
If the universe wants her to know,
She will find a way.
