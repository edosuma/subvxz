WEBVTT

00:02.869 --> 00:04.700
Good afternoon, Ensign.

00:04.771 --> 00:06.636
How are we doing today?

00:06.705 --> 00:09.402
We're doing just fine,
thank you.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.671
Good, good.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.475
By the way, l was wondering
if you'd take a look

00:14.581 --> 00:16.708
at the thermal array
in the kitchen.

00:16.783 --> 00:18.250
lt overloaded this morning

00:18.318 --> 00:20.309
and vaporized
an entire pot roast.

00:20.387 --> 00:21.581
l'd be happy to.

00:21.654 --> 00:23.849
Wonderful. My!

00:23.923 --> 00:25.788
l informed Ensign Kim
about the problem hours ago

00:25.859 --> 00:28.259
and he still hasn't
come down to fix it.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.125
He's been working on a problem

00:30.196 --> 00:32.289
with the structural
integrity grid.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.731
l'm sure he hasn't
forgotten about you.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.632
lf this thing doesn't
get fixed soon,

00:36.703 --> 00:38.728
we'll all be eating
cold leftovers for dinner,

00:38.805 --> 00:40.363
and who do you think
the crew will blame?

00:40.440 --> 00:42.408
Mm.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.409
Looks like you need a new
set of anodyne relays.

00:45.445 --> 00:46.412
l'll go down to Engineering

00:46.479 --> 00:47.707
and get some for you
out of storage.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.146
Thanks.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.742
Oh, and while you're here,
would you mind taking a look

00:52.819 --> 00:53.945
at the replicator?

00:54.020 --> 00:56.545
lt's been having
trouble making anything

00:56.623 --> 00:58.648
with large amounts
of cellulose.

00:58.725 --> 00:59.749
Of course.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.657
Cabbage, psyllium,

01:01.728 --> 01:03.855
green beans, celery,
it all comes out

01:03.930 --> 01:05.591
looking a touch too yellow.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.690
l thought you didn't
use replicated vegetables

01:07.767 --> 01:08.927
when you're cooking.

01:09.002 --> 01:11.766
Always fresh, organic,
from the airponic bay?

01:11.838 --> 01:14.864
Uh, well, the yields
have been a little low lately.

01:14.941 --> 01:19.344
Normally, l would never dream
of using synthesized veggies.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.347
lt looks like a malfunction
in the power grid.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.474
Shouldn't be too difficult...

01:26.686 --> 01:28.415
What's wrong?

01:28.488 --> 01:30.683
l think l'm having
a contraction.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.885
Oh, yeah, it's a contraction,
all right.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.120
Well, that's wonderful.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.459
Labor can't be far behind.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.158
Let's... let's get you
to Sick Bay.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.758
Try to breathe, now--
deep, deep regular breaths.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.497
Not so fast now.

01:44.571 --> 01:46.698
We're having a baby!

01:47.740 --> 01:49.105
-That's good.
-Hmm.

01:49.175 --> 01:50.073
Push!

01:53.446 --> 01:54.879
Don't forget to breathe,
Samantha.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.314
Deep regular breaths.

01:57.383 --> 01:58.577
That's it.

02:00.353 --> 02:02.378
Cervical dilation is
at 10.2 centimeters.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.116
Prostaglandin levels are normal.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.384
Push, Ensign!

02:05.458 --> 02:06.720
You push, damn it!

02:06.793 --> 02:08.419
l'm sick of pushing!

02:08.495 --> 02:09.894
l know you're fatigued.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.897
Try to focus on your breathing.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.830
Remember the exercises we did.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.425
When you feel a contraction,
bear down.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.055 --> 02:37.181
This is ridiculous.

02:37.257 --> 02:38.485
lt's been seven hours.

02:38.591 --> 02:40.991
How long does it take
to deliver a baby?

02:41.060 --> 02:43.290
As long as it takes, Mr. Paris.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.887
lndeed.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.989
During the birth
of our third child,

02:47.066 --> 02:49.091
my wife was in labor
for 96 hours.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.693
Four days?

02:50.770 --> 02:54.638
l have learned that pregnancy
and patience go hand-in-hand.

02:54.707 --> 02:57.369
You know, l didn't
expect to be this nervous.

02:57.443 --> 02:58.808
lt's not even my child.

02:58.878 --> 03:01.938
ln a way, this child
belongs to all of us.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.711
lt is the first baby
born on Voyager.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.115
l'm just not sure whether

03:06.186 --> 03:08.780
l should be welcoming it
on board or apologizing.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.254
Captain?

03:10.323 --> 03:13.588
Voyager isn't exactly
anyone's idea of a nursery,

03:13.660 --> 03:17.027
and the Delta Quadrant
isn't much of a playground.

03:17.096 --> 03:19.155
My father had a saying, Captain:

03:19.232 --> 03:21.598
''Home is
wherever you happen to be.''

03:21.668 --> 03:23.898
Captain, long-range sensors

03:23.970 --> 03:26.564
are picking up heavy subspace
communications ahead.

03:26.639 --> 03:27.901
They're Vidiian.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.134
All stop.
A ship?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.939
At least 20 ships
within sensor range.

03:32.011 --> 03:35.003
l am also detecting
a G-type star system

03:35.081 --> 03:36.946
with two inhabited planets.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.381
Life signs... Vidiian.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.214
Sounds like we're headed
right into their territory.

03:40.286 --> 03:42.914
And l'm in no mood
to donate any organs today.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.388
Options, Mr. Paris.

03:44.457 --> 03:48.791
There's a large plasma drift,
bearing 40 mark 7.

03:48.861 --> 03:51.489
lt extends almost half
the length of this sector.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.088
lnterference from the plasma

03:53.166 --> 03:54.633
should block us
from their sensors.

03:54.701 --> 03:55.668
Good thinking.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.134
Lay in a course at full impulse.

03:57.203 --> 03:59.068
Mr. Tuvok,
deflectors at maximum.

04:12.118 --> 04:13.585
Oh!

04:13.653 --> 04:15.245
Oh, what was that?!

04:15.321 --> 04:16.845
What's wrong?

04:16.923 --> 04:19.414
A pain... in my abdomen.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.858
lt's different... sharp.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.190
Oh, God!

04:23.263 --> 04:25.060
The baby has shifted position

04:25.131 --> 04:28.430
and its exocranial ridges have
lodged in the uterine wall.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.092
This is a rare complication,

04:30.169 --> 04:32.569
but it's been known to happen
in human-Ktarian pregnancies.

04:32.639 --> 04:33.799
Can we reposition the baby?

04:33.873 --> 04:35.397
No, its spinal column
is too fragile.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.908
l don't want
to risk nerve damage.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.842
lf we don't
deliver the baby now,

04:40.913 --> 04:42.904
its ridges could
perforate the uterus

04:42.982 --> 04:44.449
and cause internal bleeding.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.451
Kes, prepare
for a fetal transport.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.687
We're clearing
the Vidiian system, Captain.

04:50.757 --> 04:54.921
Take us out of the plasma drift
and resume our previous course.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.394
l've locked onto
the baby's coordinates.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.488
We're ready to begin.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.965
lnitiating umbilical separation.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.127
Energizing.

05:11.911 --> 05:14.402
Congratulations, Ensign.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.607
lt's a girl.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.647
ls she all right?

05:25.758 --> 05:28.056
The transport caused a slight
hemocythemic imbalance,

05:28.127 --> 05:30.652
but we'll stabilize
her cell membranes

05:30.730 --> 05:32.459
with osmotic pressure therapy.

05:35.234 --> 05:36.258
What was that?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.770
We hit some kind of
subspace turbulence

05:38.838 --> 05:40.829
as we were coming out
of the plasma drift.

05:40.907 --> 05:41.965
l can't tell if...

05:43.976 --> 05:45.238
What the hell?

05:45.311 --> 05:48.144
Captain, the warp engines
just stalled.

05:48.214 --> 05:49.272
Go to impulse.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.214
lmpulse engines
aren't responding.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.912
Maneuvering thrusters
are out, too.

05:53.986 --> 05:54.918
We're losing main power.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.285
Switching to backup power.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.881
Red Alert.
Bridge to Engineering.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.084
Report.

06:00.159 --> 06:01.786
Our antimatter supply is
being drained, Captain.

06:01.861 --> 06:02.793
l don't know why.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.489
The containment fields
are in place.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.498
lt's like we sprung a leak,
but l can't find the crack.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.932
B'Elanna,
try infusing the warp core

06:09.001 --> 06:10.491
with repeated proton bursts.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.629
That should be enough
to keep it going.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.173
l think l can generate enough
protons in the sensor array

06:15.241 --> 06:16.401
for a burst every 30 seconds.

06:16.476 --> 06:17.408
Do it.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.341
Hogan, these proton bursts

06:19.412 --> 06:21.607
are going to cause a lot
of stress on the hull.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.012
Reinforce structural
integrity to...

06:24.384 --> 06:26.284
Now what?

06:29.756 --> 06:31.053
What was that?

06:31.124 --> 06:33.058
lt appeared to be
a proton burst.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.184
Already?

06:34.260 --> 06:35.557
Bridge to Torres, report.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.553
Engineering, respond.

06:38.631 --> 06:42.226
Captain, three EPS conduits
just ruptured in Engineering.

06:42.301 --> 06:43.825
They took heavy casualties.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.774
The incubator is losing power.

06:49.842 --> 06:51.776
Activate the auxiliary
respirator.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.773
We've got wounded here!

08:50.329 --> 08:52.854
Second-degree plasma burns
on the face and neck.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.900
Treat him
with the dermaline gel.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.299
Fractured clavicle,
thoracic contusions.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.167
Nothing serious, she can wait.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.502
Fused vertebrae,
prep him for surgery.

09:01.574 --> 09:02.506
Status.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.542
lt doesn't look good, Doctor.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.167
The baby's cell membranes
won't stabilize.

09:05.244 --> 09:07.109
lncrease the osmotic...

09:10.349 --> 09:11.543
That's not helping.

09:11.617 --> 09:13.744
lncrease the osmotic
pressure ratio by ten percent.

09:13.819 --> 09:15.047
Bridge to Sick Bay.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.817
There's been a major
coolant leak in the Mess Hall.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.289
You've got more wounded
on the way.

09:19.358 --> 09:21.349
Acknowledged.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.356
Torres to Bridge!

09:24.430 --> 09:25.362
We're definitely being...

09:26.599 --> 09:29.124
We're definitely being
hit by proton bursts,

09:29.201 --> 09:31.726
but l don't know
where they're coming from.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.829
l never even started
the procedure.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.875
She's right; the main
sensor array is off-line.

09:36.943 --> 09:37.967
Not a single burst was fired.

09:38.044 --> 09:39.409
And yet the bursts appear
to be originating

09:39.512 --> 09:40.410
from within the ship.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.174
lt's like they're coming out
of thin air.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.408
Captain, these bursts
are weakening

09:43.482 --> 09:44.574
the structural integrity
of the hull.

09:44.650 --> 09:45.674
We cannot take any more.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.720
Can we increase power
to structural reinforcement?

09:48.788 --> 09:50.949
Our antimatter supply
is too low.

09:51.023 --> 09:52.991
There's just not
enough power to go...

09:54.894 --> 09:57.863
Hull breach on Deck 15,
Section 29-Alpha.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.727
Emergency force fields
are off-line.

09:59.799 --> 10:01.061
Captain, l've been
working on a way

10:01.133 --> 10:03.260
to enhance our portable
force field generators.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.598
lt might be enough
to seal that breach.

10:04.670 --> 10:05.694
Go.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.365
Don't you worry.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.242
We have the best doctor
in the Quadrant.

10:14.313 --> 10:16.474
Doctor, her cell membranes
are losing cohesion.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.244
Try remodulating
the osmotic pressure.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.077
No effect.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.680
Hang on, l'll be right there.

10:35.534 --> 10:36.728
Oh, no.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.100
Jefferies tube 12 runs
right over the breach.

10:39.171 --> 10:40.968
lf we can get close enough,
we should be able

10:41.040 --> 10:42.507
to set up a portable
containment field.

10:42.608 --> 10:43.973
The breach has
weakened the integrity

10:44.043 --> 10:45.010
of that tube by 22 percent.

10:45.077 --> 10:46.738
That's why we need
to reinforce the field.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.404
We'll use the power
conduits on this deck.

10:54.286 --> 10:56.550
l've analyzed the bursts
on all spectral frequencies.

10:56.622 --> 10:58.556
There's still no indication
of where they're coming from.

10:58.624 --> 10:59.784
At this point,

10:59.859 --> 11:01.326
l don't give a damn
where they're coming from.

11:01.427 --> 11:02.359
l just want to stop them.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.862
Chakotay, do we have
enough auxiliary power

11:03.929 --> 11:04.918
to magnetize the hull?

11:04.997 --> 11:06.362
lt might cushion the impact
of the bursts.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.592
We have just barely enough.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.158
Give it a try.

11:10.236 --> 11:11.260
l've stabilized
my imaging array,

11:11.337 --> 11:12.361
but it could go out at any time.

11:12.438 --> 11:13.405
Doctor...

11:13.472 --> 11:14.905
Prepare for emergency
resuscitation.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.441
My baby, she...

11:16.509 --> 11:19.273
she's going to die, isn't she?

11:19.345 --> 11:21.040
Not if l can help it.

11:26.152 --> 11:27.380
Here it is.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.114
The breach is directly below us.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.893
Make it fast, Harry.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.622
Torres to Hogan.
What's your status?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.130
Almost got it, Lieutenant.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.167
l'm rerouting all power
in this section to your...

11:47.573 --> 11:49.040
Torres to Hogan.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.166
Hogan, are you there?

11:51.577 --> 11:53.204
l'm hurt.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.439
Hurry.
We have to help him.

11:54.513 --> 11:56.572
Just give me a minute.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.549
Again!

12:01.620 --> 12:03.417
Nothing.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.792
l'm sorry, Ensign.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.798
Hogan to Sick Bay.

12:21.874 --> 12:25.002
l need... medical assistance...

12:25.077 --> 12:27.341
Deck 15, Section 29.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.607
l'll go.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.753
The breach is widening.
Let's get out of here.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.349
Damn it, Harry, let's go!

12:39.425 --> 12:41.620
Hold on.
My minute isn't up yet...!

12:46.899 --> 12:48.264
Harry!

12:48.334 --> 12:51.064
Grab my hand!

12:59.278 --> 13:00.506
Harry!

13:07.419 --> 13:09.410
Lieutenant Hogan!

13:09.488 --> 13:11.251
Kes! Over here!

13:22.601 --> 13:23.829
Torres to Bridge.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.666
Ensign Kim is dead.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.797
Kes just disappeared.

13:27.873 --> 13:28.999
Disappeared?!

13:29.074 --> 13:30.166
l can't explain it.

13:30.242 --> 13:33.700
She just vanished.

13:33.779 --> 13:36.247
There seems to be
some kind of spatial rift

13:36.315 --> 13:38.078
right where she disappeared.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.243
Can you determine
where it leads?

13:40.319 --> 13:41.843
Stand by, Bridge.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.184
l just threw a piece of conduit
into the rift.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.456
Just as it vanished,
l detected another

13:51.530 --> 13:53.259
oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.492
Another atmosphere?

13:54.567 --> 13:56.967
Whatever's on
the other side of that rift

13:57.036 --> 13:59.129
there's air--
maybe Kes is still alive.

14:02.608 --> 14:03.575
Get out of there, Torres.

14:03.642 --> 14:04.574
The hull breach is widening.

14:04.643 --> 14:05.667
l'm going to evacuate
the entire deck.

14:06.912 --> 14:09.005
You don't have to tell me twice.

14:09.081 --> 14:11.015
The main computer core
is failing.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.846
Switching to backup processors.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.083
Chakotay, are you ready
to magnetize the hull?

14:16.155 --> 14:17.122
Stand by.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.918
l'm having trouble with
the alignment module.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.481
Try remodulating
the field emitter.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.160
Chakotay.

14:25.164 --> 14:27.132
l've got alignment.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.394
Magnetizing the hull.

14:38.911 --> 14:39.935
l think it worked.

14:40.012 --> 14:41.206
Let's hope so.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.578
l want a full damage report
from all decks.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.173
Are you all right, Captain?

14:45.251 --> 14:46.809
lt's just a scratch.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.910
lt's more than a scratch.
Maybe you should go...

14:47.987 --> 14:49.079
l'm fine, Lieutenant.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.054
Damage reports are coming in.

14:51.123 --> 14:53.956
The hull breach
on Deck 15 has widened

14:54.026 --> 14:56.119
to include Deck 14, Section 12.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.595
And there are
632 micro-fractures

14:58.664 --> 15:00.529
along the hull's infrastructure.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.464
All primary systems
are off-line.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.764
We are running
on emergency power only.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.305
The antimatter supply
has dropped to 18 percent

15:07.373 --> 15:09.000
and is continuing to fall.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.542
Warp coils in both
nacelles have fused

15:11.610 --> 15:12.907
and are inoperative.

15:12.978 --> 15:15.913
The environmental control
systems are failing.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.745
15 crew members have
been seriously wounded

15:18.817 --> 15:19.875
with plasma burns.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.817
27 experienced other injuries.

15:21.887 --> 15:24.617
The Doctor is setting up
triage facilities

15:24.690 --> 15:26.521
in Sick Bay and Holodeck 2.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.583
l must also regretfully report

15:28.661 --> 15:31.494
that Ensign Wildman's baby
did not survive.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.034
l want an Engineering team
to seal those micro-fractures

15:38.103 --> 15:39.070
before they become breaches.

15:39.138 --> 15:40.105
Aye, Captain.

15:40.172 --> 15:41.104
Mr. Paris, grab

15:41.173 --> 15:42.663
a medical tricorder
and go assist the Doctor.

15:42.741 --> 15:43.867
Right.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.410
Commander, you have the Bridge.
l'm going

15:45.477 --> 15:46.444
to go talk to Ensign Wildman.

15:46.512 --> 15:47.444
Maybe l can help...

15:55.854 --> 15:58.345
The magnetic field
is collapsing!

15:58.424 --> 16:00.289
The hull is depolarizing!

16:05.364 --> 16:07.559
The fire suppression
system is out.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.295
Warning. Hull breach on Deck 1.

16:10.369 --> 16:12.234
Emergency force fields
inoperative.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.272
Everybody out!
Go! Go! Go!

16:17.443 --> 16:19.206
Hurry, Captain!

16:19.278 --> 16:20.973
l'm trying
to reroute emergency power

16:21.046 --> 16:23.105
to the field emitters!

16:25.417 --> 16:26.850
Captain!

16:26.919 --> 16:28.978
l can seal this breach!

16:38.130 --> 16:40.564
Captain, let's go!

16:49.441 --> 16:51.534
Captain?

16:51.610 --> 16:53.942
Ensign Kim, scan the Bridge.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.775
l just saw myself
cross the Bridge

16:57.850 --> 16:59.977
and enter that turbolift.

17:00.052 --> 17:04.250
lt was very faint--
almost like a ghost image--

17:04.323 --> 17:05.915
and l looked like hell.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.750
Captain,

17:08.827 --> 17:10.988
there was a minor spatial
fluctuation on the Bridge,

17:11.063 --> 17:13.223
but it was only there
for a millisecond.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.095
Bridge to Engineering.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.361
B'Elanna, how long
until we can use

17:16.468 --> 17:17.901
the main sensor array?

17:17.970 --> 17:19.096
Another three hours.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.537
We're only about halfway through
the proton burst procedure.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.006
See if you can speed up
the process.

17:23.075 --> 17:25.805
We need the sensors as soon
as possible.

17:25.877 --> 17:26.810
Understood.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.744
Mr. Kim, modify a tricorder

17:28.814 --> 17:30.873
to scan for spatial anomalies.

17:30.949 --> 17:33.713
Go over every centimeter
of this Bridge.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.413
Examine the sensor logs

17:35.487 --> 17:38.183
from our trip through
the plasma drift.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.020
Look for anything unusual.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.423
l'll be in Sick Bay.

17:41.493 --> 17:43.120
Aye, Captain.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.195
Good news, Ensign.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.429
Our baby is perfectly healthy.

17:51.537 --> 17:55.200
There's no sign of
any inter-species abnormalities.

17:55.274 --> 17:56.673
''Our'' baby.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.175
A figure of speech.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.871
l am, in part, responsible
for bringing her into the world.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.909
You may hold her now.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.417
Hello, there.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.948
Congratulations, Samantha.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.922
She's adorable.

18:17.996 --> 18:19.190
Have you thought of a name?

18:19.264 --> 18:20.253
Not yet.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.857
l really thought
it would be a boy.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.028
Let me know
as soon as you decide.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.572
l've been making
a blanket for her.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.869
All that's missing
is an initial.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.443
Get some rest.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.907
How's our other patient doing?

18:38.984 --> 18:40.542
She's still unconscious.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.416
l ran a microcellular scan.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.956
We're almost identical
in every way.

18:45.023 --> 18:46.354
Almost?

18:46.425 --> 18:49.223
There's a slight phase shift
in their DNA.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.752
Do you have any theory
about where she came from?

18:52.831 --> 18:55.163
Not yet,
but l intend to find out.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.394
Can you wake her?

18:56.468 --> 18:57.867
l believe so.

18:57.936 --> 18:59.426
Good...

18:59.571 --> 19:01.505
because l think
she's going to have

19:01.607 --> 19:03.234
an interesting story to tell.

19:08.914 --> 19:12.350
l was running through the
corridor with my medkit...

19:12.451 --> 19:16.353
Deck 15...

19:16.421 --> 19:19.254
and then, suddenly,

19:19.324 --> 19:21.792
l felt dizzy

19:21.860 --> 19:23.589
and my vision started to blur.

19:26.064 --> 19:28.965
After that,
l don't remember anything

19:29.034 --> 19:31.366
until you woke me up
just now.

19:31.436 --> 19:33.529
You were found unconscious
down on Deck 15

19:33.605 --> 19:35.095
holding a medkit.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.041
We also found this
lying next to you.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.806
lt's a piece of damaged conduit.

19:40.879 --> 19:45.543
Our analysis shows
it's from Voyager, Deck 15,

19:45.617 --> 19:48.780
Section 29-Alpha, Bulkhead 052--

19:48.854 --> 19:51.948
but there's no damage to Deck 15
or anywhere else on this ship.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.187
There was massive damage
to Deck 15.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.091
The evidence
would seem to suggest

19:57.162 --> 19:59.221
that you've come
from a different ship...

19:59.298 --> 20:01.266
a different Voyager.

20:02.634 --> 20:05.364
We did find a spatial
rift on Deck 15.

20:05.437 --> 20:07.667
lt's possible that it
somehow connects us

20:07.739 --> 20:08.899
to this other Voyager.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.204
lf you're right,
where is the other ship?

20:11.276 --> 20:13.301
A parallel universe?
Another dimension?

20:13.378 --> 20:14.606
Another point in time?

20:14.680 --> 20:16.045
l'm not sure.

20:16.114 --> 20:18.947
Almost everything about
the Voyager Kes described

20:19.017 --> 20:20.211
is identical to ours.

20:20.285 --> 20:23.482
We've had similar experiences,
similar personal histories.

20:23.589 --> 20:27.958
We both entered a plasma cloud
to avoid the Vidiians.

20:28.026 --> 20:30.688
Both of our engines stalled
as we left the cloud,

20:30.762 --> 20:33.697
which caused both of our
antimatter supplies to drain

20:33.765 --> 20:36.063
and then we both decided
to keep our engines running

20:36.134 --> 20:39.103
by emitting proton bursts...

20:39.171 --> 20:43.073
but after that,
our experiences diverged.

20:44.443 --> 20:47.776
We started emitting
the proton bursts.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.108
They didn't.

20:49.181 --> 20:51.046
Our ship was being damaged
by proton bursts.

20:51.116 --> 20:53.812
We couldn't figure out
where they were coming from.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.512
That's more than a coincidence.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.884
Janeway to Engineering.

20:56.955 --> 21:00.049
B'Elanna, l want you to stop
the proton bursts immediately.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.752
But if we stop now,
the power levels will drop...

21:01.827 --> 21:03.954
l'll explain later, Lieutenant.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.690
Understood.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.392
l don't know how...

21:08.467 --> 21:11.436
but there's another
Voyager out there

21:11.536 --> 21:13.197
and l intend to find it.

21:18.076 --> 21:19.566
We analyzed the sensor logs

21:19.645 --> 21:21.112
from our trip
through the plasma cloud.

21:21.179 --> 21:22.737
We couldn't find
anything unusual

21:22.814 --> 21:25.840
until we ran
a quantum-level analysis.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.282
Remember that subspace
turbulence we hit

21:27.352 --> 21:28.341
just before we left the cloud?

21:28.420 --> 21:29.352
Yes.

21:29.421 --> 21:31.514
Well, watch what happens.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.851
At first, we thought it was
a sensor aberration,

21:36.928 --> 21:39.396
but they were in perfect
calibration at the time.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.159
So l ran a
multispectral analysis

21:41.233 --> 21:42.666
on the subspace turbulence.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.463
lt was more
than just turbulence.

21:44.536 --> 21:46.401
lt was some kind
of divergence field.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.733
And the moment
we passed through it,

21:47.806 --> 21:49.501
all of our sensor
readings doubled.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.132
Mass, energy output,
bio-signatures-- everything.

21:52.210 --> 21:54.701
Every particle
of matter on the ship

21:54.780 --> 21:56.441
seems to have been
duplicated in that instant.

21:56.515 --> 21:58.915
So where's the other ship?

21:58.984 --> 22:00.611
As strange as it sounds,
Captain,

22:00.719 --> 22:02.209
according to these readings,

22:02.254 --> 22:04.415
another Voyager is
right here, right now,

22:04.489 --> 22:07.925
occupying the same point
in space-time that we are.

22:09.728 --> 22:11.753
Quantum theorists
at Kent State University

22:11.830 --> 22:14.526
ran an experiment in which
a single particle of matter

22:14.599 --> 22:17.295
was duplicated using the
divergence of subspace fields--

22:17.369 --> 22:20.133
a spatial scission.

22:20.205 --> 22:22.605
lf the same forces were at work
inside the plasma cloud,

22:22.674 --> 22:24.608
they may have duplicated
every particle of matter

22:24.676 --> 22:25.608
on Voyager.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.475
Matter... but not antimatter.

22:28.547 --> 22:29.479
Captain?

22:29.548 --> 22:31.482
ln that Kent State experiment,

22:31.550 --> 22:33.780
they were able
to duplicate normal matter,

22:33.852 --> 22:35.786
but when they tried to duplicate
antimatter particles,

22:35.854 --> 22:38.118
the experiment failed.

22:38.190 --> 22:42.354
So the antimatter on the ships
wasn't duplicated.

22:42.427 --> 22:45.396
Both engines have been
trying to draw power

22:45.464 --> 22:47.625
from a single source
of antimatter.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.792
Like Siamese twins
linked at the chest,

22:49.868 --> 22:51.665
with only one heart.

22:51.737 --> 22:53.102
So what do we do?

22:53.171 --> 22:55.105
l don't know,
but whatever it is,

22:55.173 --> 22:57.107
we're going to have
to coordinate it

22:57.175 --> 22:58.267
with the other ship.

22:58.343 --> 22:59.970
Start working on a way
to communicate with them.

23:00.045 --> 23:00.977
Right.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.412
The only link we know of
is on Deck 15--

23:03.515 --> 23:04.641
the spatial rift.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.776
We're going to need a way
to send Kes back through safely.

23:07.853 --> 23:10.413
We could rig a portable
phase discriminator.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.719
lt might protect her
from the spatial transition.

23:12.791 --> 23:14.418
Get on it.

23:16.294 --> 23:19.024
When can l start breast feeding?

23:19.097 --> 23:20.029
Right away.

23:20.098 --> 23:21.565
However, l should forewarn you

23:21.633 --> 23:24.761
that her incisors will erupt
within three to four weeks.

23:24.836 --> 23:27.999
Since your skin lacks
the scales of a Ktarian,

23:28.073 --> 23:31.042
we'll have
to discuss alternatives.

23:31.109 --> 23:32.406
When can l take her home?

23:32.477 --> 23:34.308
ln 24 hours.

23:34.379 --> 23:35.971
l want to observe the infant
to make sure

23:36.047 --> 23:38.277
there's no more damage
to her cell membranes.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.750
You're welcome to stay the night
so you may be with her.

23:40.819 --> 23:41.945
l'd like that.

23:42.988 --> 23:44.717
Hey... what's the matter?

23:52.063 --> 23:54.861
Congratulations, Ensign...

23:54.933 --> 23:56.662
it's a girl.

23:56.735 --> 23:57.895
l've stabilized
my imaging array,

23:57.969 --> 23:59.095
but it could go out
at any time.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.934
Doctor, her cell membranes
are losing cohesion.

24:01.039 --> 24:02.973
Try remodulating
the osmotic pressure.

24:03.008 --> 24:03.940
No effect.

24:04.009 --> 24:04.941
Again.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.068
Nothing.

24:06.144 --> 24:07.907
My baby, she's going
to die, isn't she?

24:07.979 --> 24:09.537
l'm sorry, Ensign.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.377
She's going to die, isn't she?

24:12.851 --> 24:15.285
Kes...

24:15.353 --> 24:17.116
Kes?

24:19.090 --> 24:20.887
Are you all right?

24:20.959 --> 24:22.950
Yes.

24:23.028 --> 24:26.088
lt's just...
the baby's crying.

24:26.164 --> 24:28.428
lt was like a bad memory.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.024
What do you mean?

24:30.101 --> 24:31.898
On my Voyager,

24:31.970 --> 24:36.270
during the delivery,
there were complications.

24:36.341 --> 24:38.639
We performed a fetal transport.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.143
The same thing happened here.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.645
The transport was successful.

24:41.713 --> 24:46.446
On my ship, the medical systems
were heavily damaged.

24:46.518 --> 24:48.679
The osmotic pressure therapy
didn't work.

24:48.753 --> 24:50.243
The baby died.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.018
l'm sorry to hear that.

24:53.091 --> 24:54.718
But try to understand,
it wasn't your fault.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.920
The situation was
out of your control.

24:58.797 --> 25:00.128
Doctor, l've got
to get back to my ship.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.164
They need my help.

25:01.199 --> 25:03.667
The Captain's working on it,
Kes.

25:03.735 --> 25:08.035
ln the meantime,
try to get some rest.

25:09.741 --> 25:13.575
Besides, l'm sure your Voyager
is also equipped

25:13.645 --> 25:17.741
with a proficient
Emergency Medical Hologram.

25:22.888 --> 25:23.820
lt's a little harder

25:23.889 --> 25:26.380
to establish a com link
than l thought, Captain.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.153
The molecular signature
of the second Voyager

25:28.226 --> 25:30.251
is slightly out of phase
with our own.

25:30.328 --> 25:32.888
l can't get visual, audio--
nothing.

25:32.964 --> 25:35.364
Have you tried remodulating
the com-frequency carrier?

25:35.433 --> 25:37.697
Five times on 47
different frequencies.

25:37.769 --> 25:39.066
There has to be a way.

25:39.137 --> 25:42.163
lf they were recalibrating their
carrier wave at the same time--

25:42.240 --> 25:44.140
so we could match
phase variants--

25:44.209 --> 25:45.608
would that allow us to connect?

25:45.677 --> 25:48.271
l think so, but, in order
to get them to do that,

25:48.346 --> 25:50.473
we'd have to communicate
with them first.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.141
lt's the chicken and the egg.

25:52.217 --> 25:55.653
Maybe we need something
a little more primitive.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.780
ls there a signal we could
emit on all subspace bands

25:58.857 --> 26:00.518
just to get their attention?

26:00.625 --> 26:04.061
A rotating band pulse
might do it,

26:04.095 --> 26:05.824
but it wouldn't be much
more than a shrill whistle.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.331
That might be enough.
Give it a try.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.367
All right, Captain.

26:09.434 --> 26:11.334
All of the ship's
command functions

26:11.403 --> 26:13.735
have been rerouted
to Main Engineering.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.136
Welcome to the new Bridge.

26:15.206 --> 26:16.400
Now, let's see about...

26:17.475 --> 26:18.669
What's that?

26:18.743 --> 26:19.710
l don't know.

26:19.778 --> 26:21.245
lt's some kind of com emissions

26:21.313 --> 26:22.974
coming through
all subspace bands.

26:23.048 --> 26:23.980
Coming from where?

26:24.049 --> 26:26.040
Good question.
l can't tell.

26:26.117 --> 26:27.948
But it's got
a Federation signature.

26:28.019 --> 26:30.146
Try recalibrating
our frequency carrier

26:30.221 --> 26:31.188
to match it.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.253
That's it.

26:36.328 --> 26:37.317
They recalibrated

26:37.395 --> 26:39.226
and locked onto
our phase variant.

26:39.297 --> 26:40.730
What kind of communication
can we establish?

26:40.799 --> 26:42.426
Not much, at this point.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.899
We can use the emergency
encryption code

26:43.969 --> 26:44.901
for a short message.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.130
Not more than five seconds.

26:46.204 --> 26:47.501
That should be enough.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.302
That's the emergency code.

26:52.377 --> 26:55.073
Run it through
an alpha-numeric sequencer.

26:58.416 --> 27:00.509
l think someone's telling us

27:00.619 --> 27:05.352
to lock onto a frequency
of 12 gigahertz.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.358
Do it.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.354
l'll try to clear it up.

27:19.537 --> 27:21.095
Captain...

27:21.172 --> 27:22.764
this isn't an illusion.

27:22.841 --> 27:24.536
What you're seeing is real,

27:24.609 --> 27:28.101
but it's going to take
some explaining.

27:28.179 --> 27:30.374
There are two Voyagers
and two crews?

27:30.448 --> 27:32.040
That's what l was told.

27:32.117 --> 27:33.277
Could this possibly be

27:33.351 --> 27:35.080
some kind of subterfuge,
Captain?

27:35.153 --> 27:36.177
An alien deception?

27:36.254 --> 27:37.585
That woman, whoever she is,

27:37.656 --> 27:40.386
had very specific knowledge
of what happened here--

27:40.458 --> 27:42.187
the damage
from the proton bursts,

27:42.260 --> 27:44.091
Wildman's baby,
Kes disappearing.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.426
She even knew that when
l was 12 years old,

27:46.531 --> 27:48.795
l walked home in a thunderstorm
over seven kilometers

27:48.867 --> 27:50.027
because l lost a tennis match.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.762
And her explanation
of how the ships

27:51.836 --> 27:55.363
were duplicated was
certainly plausible.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.032
lf it is true,
what do we do about it?

27:57.108 --> 28:01.374
My... counterpart
has suggested we try

28:01.446 --> 28:02.538
to merge the two ships--

28:02.614 --> 28:04.275
recreate the subspace
divergence field

28:04.349 --> 28:06.214
we passed through
and then depolarize it.

28:06.284 --> 28:07.842
Both ships would have
to send out

28:07.919 --> 28:09.853
a massive resonance pulse
from their deflector dishes

28:09.921 --> 28:11.821
at exactly the same time.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.152
They may be able to do that,

28:13.224 --> 28:16.022
but we barely have enough
power for life support.

28:16.094 --> 28:17.220
How can we get enough

28:17.295 --> 28:19.320
to send an energy pulse
of that size?

28:19.397 --> 28:21.729
We could evacuate
all the crew to this deck

28:21.800 --> 28:23.495
and cut off life support
everywhere else.

28:23.568 --> 28:26.230
Then we could divert all power
to the deflector dish.

28:26.304 --> 28:27.635
B'Elanna, reestablish
the com-link

28:27.706 --> 28:28.968
with the other ship.

28:32.143 --> 28:34.236
This is Janeway.
What have you decided?

28:35.313 --> 28:39.044
Captain, we think we can
channel enough energy

28:39.117 --> 28:40.914
to our deflector dish
to try the merging process.

28:40.985 --> 28:42.953
Good. When can we start?

28:43.021 --> 28:44.750
We'll need
at least 15 minutes

28:44.823 --> 28:46.222
to make our preparations.

28:46.291 --> 28:47.417
We'll be ready.

28:47.525 --> 28:50.221
And, Captain...

28:50.295 --> 28:52.820
we'll only have enough
power to try this once.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.364
l understand.

28:56.935 --> 28:59.335
Chakotay, Tuvok, begin
the evacuation process.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.268
Aye, Captain.

29:00.371 --> 29:01.599
l'll let the Doctor know

29:01.639 --> 29:04.301
he'll have to rely
on his backup power supply.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.352
We're ready, Captain.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.889
We're standing by, Captain.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.985
l think you should take the lead
in this operation,

29:24.062 --> 29:26.053
since you may have
to make allowances

29:26.131 --> 29:27.826
for your ship's
weakened power systems.

29:27.899 --> 29:28.831
Acknowledged.

29:28.900 --> 29:29.992
Lieutenant Torres--

29:30.068 --> 29:31.228
and Lieutenant Torres--

29:31.302 --> 29:33.361
charge the deflector dishes.

29:35.073 --> 29:37.405
Deflector dish charging.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.409
Capacitance levels
are rising.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.409
60 percent...

29:40.512 --> 29:42.503
85 percent...

29:42.580 --> 29:45.048
98 percent...

29:45.116 --> 29:47.949
We're ready to create
the subspace divergence field.

29:48.019 --> 29:50.544
lnitiating.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.647
Power flow nominal, Captain.

29:52.724 --> 29:56.057
Synchronize computer
event timing.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.721
Ready to release
depolarization pulse

29:58.797 --> 30:01.061
on my mark.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.430
Now.

30:11.509 --> 30:13.477
The pulses have been
emitted, Captain.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.376
The fields are starting
to depolarize!

30:15.446 --> 30:17.380
But we aren't merging.

30:17.448 --> 30:19.814
ln fact, we're going
further out of phase!

30:19.884 --> 30:21.943
lncrease power
to the deflector dish.

30:23.288 --> 30:25.722
l can't!
Too much plasma backflow.

30:25.790 --> 30:27.223
lf we keep this up,
we're going to lose

30:27.292 --> 30:29.283
our antimatter connection--
we'll both be destroyed!

30:29.360 --> 30:30.292
Abort!

30:30.361 --> 30:31.794
Aborting resonance pulse.

30:31.863 --> 30:32.795
What went wrong?

30:32.864 --> 30:34.024
l'm not sure.

30:34.098 --> 30:35.998
l think the plasma flow
became too turbulent.

30:36.067 --> 30:37.466
The divergence fields
were so chaotic,

30:37.535 --> 30:38.763
we couldn't complete
the merging.

30:40.205 --> 30:41.502
We've lost the com-link,
as well.

30:43.508 --> 30:48.445
Captain... the antimatter leak,
it's becoming a hemorrhage.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.980
lf we don't start
the proton bursts,

30:50.048 --> 30:52.414
we'll be completely
drained in 30 minutes.

30:52.483 --> 30:54.280
The lives of both crews
are at stake here.

30:54.352 --> 30:55.819
l can't make
unilateral decisions

30:55.887 --> 30:57.411
that might affect
that other ship.

30:57.488 --> 30:59.080
Janeway to Kim.

30:59.157 --> 31:01.022
ls the spatial rift
still stable?

31:01.125 --> 31:02.057
l think so, Captain.

31:02.093 --> 31:03.651
And l've rigged
a phase discriminator.

31:03.728 --> 31:05.423
Kes should be able
to go back safely.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.122
Rig another one, Ensign.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.722
l'm going with her.

31:14.339 --> 31:16.967
This should protect you
from the spatial transition.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.134
Keep trying to reestablish
a com-link between the ships.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.268
l will, but remember

31:20.345 --> 31:22.313
we have fewer than 30 minutes
of antimatter left.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.473
Whatever you do over
there, do it fast.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.073
Understood.
Are you ready?

31:26.150 --> 31:27.117
Yes.

31:34.692 --> 31:36.023
lt's gotten worse here.

31:36.094 --> 31:37.857
Command control is
in Main Engineering.

31:37.929 --> 31:38.918
Let's go.

31:41.366 --> 31:44.062
l don't know how else to stop
the antimatter drain

31:44.135 --> 31:45.500
except with proton bursts.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.935
We can't do that.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.974
We'd damage the other ship
just like this one.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.099
Think, people.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.506
We need options.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.477
l agree, Captain.

31:56.314 --> 31:58.475
And l think we need to talk.

32:05.623 --> 32:08.091
By my estimates,
our antimatter supply

32:08.159 --> 32:09.888
will run out in less
than half an hour.

32:11.362 --> 32:12.522
The attempt to merge our ships

32:12.597 --> 32:14.258
is throwing us
further out of phase.

32:14.332 --> 32:15.390
The quantum cohesion

32:15.466 --> 32:17.525
on both Voyagers
is breaking down.

32:18.536 --> 32:21.300
Just like the original
Kent State experiment.

32:21.372 --> 32:23.704
The duplicate atoms couldn't
occupy the same point

32:23.775 --> 32:25.766
in space-time
for very long before...

32:25.843 --> 32:28.607
Mutual annihilation.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.977
What are our options?

32:30.048 --> 32:31.777
Let's try a different tack.

32:31.849 --> 32:34.409
lnstead of trying to merge
the two ships,

32:34.485 --> 32:36.578
let's try to separate them.

32:36.654 --> 32:39.953
Maybe we could divide
the antimatter between us.

32:40.024 --> 32:41.184
l'm afraid not.

32:41.259 --> 32:43.022
We've been studying
that theory.

32:43.094 --> 32:44.959
B'Elanna tells me
that any attempt to disrupt

32:45.029 --> 32:48.089
the antimatter supply
would destroy us all.

32:48.166 --> 32:50.225
What about evacuating
your crew to my ship?

32:50.301 --> 32:52.496
lt might get a little crowded,
but we could manage.

32:52.603 --> 32:54.468
We've been studying that theory,

32:54.539 --> 32:57.099
and my B'Elanna tells me
that sending any more

32:57.175 --> 32:59.405
than five to ten people
through the rift

32:59.477 --> 33:00.910
would radically alter
the atomic balance

33:01.012 --> 33:02.001
of the two Voyagers.

33:02.046 --> 33:04.014
We'd both be destroyed.

33:07.919 --> 33:10.547
Captain, l think you should
return to your ship

33:10.621 --> 33:13.419
and run a metallurgical
analysis.

33:13.524 --> 33:16.857
Find out the precise phase
modulation of your hull.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.555
l'll do the same here.

33:18.629 --> 33:19.653
Maybe we can find a way

33:19.731 --> 33:22.222
to realign
the phase displacement.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.598
You're going
to self-destruct your ship.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.899
What makes you say that?

33:26.971 --> 33:30.270
Because that's what l would do
if your Voyager were intact

33:30.341 --> 33:33.833
and my Voyager were crippled,
my crew wounded or dead.

33:33.911 --> 33:37.278
l'd sacrifice my ship
so that yours could survive.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.942
Then l'm glad we agree.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.485
Go back to your ship.

33:41.586 --> 33:42.746
l didn't say l agree.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.048
l said l understand.

33:44.122 --> 33:46.750
l'm not willing to let you
make that sacrifice yet.

33:46.824 --> 33:48.792
We haven't explored
all the options.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.953
Yes, we have,
and we both know it.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.997
This is my ship and my decision.

33:53.064 --> 33:53.996
Captain, l'm not
going to let you...

33:54.065 --> 33:55.054
l've made my decision.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.600
Please don't make me
call Security

33:56.667 --> 33:59.636
and have you escorted
off my ship because...

33:59.704 --> 34:02.867
you know l'll do it.

34:04.075 --> 34:05.406
All right, l'll go back.

34:05.476 --> 34:06.670
But give me 15 minutes

34:06.744 --> 34:08.541
to come up
with another solution.

34:08.612 --> 34:10.842
After that, it's your decision.

34:13.117 --> 34:15.585
15 minutes.

34:15.652 --> 34:18.213
Good luck.

34:18.289 --> 34:19.654
To both of us.

34:26.630 --> 34:28.428
Okay, l've managed to
reestablish a com-link

34:28.498 --> 34:29.431
with the other Voyager.

34:29.534 --> 34:30.501
Hail them.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.234
Captain, l've got an idea.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.068
Actually, it was yours.

34:36.139 --> 34:37.232
lt might be possible

34:37.308 --> 34:39.172
to realign the phase
displacement between us.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.175
We don't have time to try it.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.973
My plan is the only one
that's going to work.

34:42.045 --> 34:43.513
lt's time
that we both accept that.

34:44.649 --> 34:45.809
We've got a perimeter alert.

34:45.882 --> 34:49.842
A vessel is approaching,
bearing 005 mark 318.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.581
They've just dropped out
of warp.

34:51.656 --> 34:53.123
Can you identify them?

34:53.190 --> 34:54.385
They're Vidiian, sir.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.693
Red Alert.

34:57.762 --> 34:58.592
Shields.

34:58.663 --> 34:59.595
Still off-line.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.359
Captain, we're picking up
a Vidiian ship

35:01.466 --> 35:02.398
heading this way.

35:02.433 --> 35:03.627
Can you see them, too?

35:03.701 --> 35:04.633
Yes.

35:04.702 --> 35:05.930
Do you have any weapons?

35:06.003 --> 35:07.470
Stand by. Tuvok?

35:07.538 --> 35:08.505
Negative, Captain.

35:08.573 --> 35:09.562
We had to reroute power

35:09.640 --> 35:11.267
to compensate
for the antimatter loss.

35:11.342 --> 35:13.970
lt would take several hours
to bring weapons back on line.

35:18.816 --> 35:20.249
What is it?

35:20.318 --> 35:23.879
Their ship seems to be trapped
in some sort of spatial flux.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.752
-Have they detected us?
-Yes,

35:25.823 --> 35:27.916
but they can't
raise their shields.

35:27.992 --> 35:29.983
And it appears that whatever
is happening to them

35:30.061 --> 35:32.859
has disrupted
their weapon systems.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.693
Load a hyperthermic charge.

35:38.169 --> 35:39.295
Fire.

35:39.370 --> 35:42.237
Captain, they have fired
an energy weapon.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.796
All hands, brace for impact.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.810
Damage control teams
stand by.

35:51.849 --> 35:53.043
What happened?

35:53.117 --> 35:54.584
They couldn't have missed.

35:54.652 --> 35:55.676
Maybe they hit
the other Voyager.

35:55.753 --> 35:56.685
Hail them.

35:56.754 --> 35:58.381
l've lost the com-link again.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.720
Try to get it back.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.695
We have destroyed
their weapons array.

36:11.769 --> 36:14.465
Maneuver us
to within grappling range.

36:22.413 --> 36:26.406
They are cutting an access route
through the hull on Deck 5.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.913
Vulcan, male.

36:57.982 --> 37:00.041
Phaser blast damaged
the right kidney,

37:00.151 --> 37:01.277
but the other organs
are healthy.

37:01.319 --> 37:02.946
Begin with them.

37:24.308 --> 37:27.038
l've erected an emergency
force field around Sick Bay.

37:27.111 --> 37:28.544
That should hold them off
for awhile.

37:28.613 --> 37:29.705
l won't let them take my baby.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.407
lt's going to be all right,
Ensign.

37:31.482 --> 37:33.848
Give her to me and l'll hide
her inside an access port.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.078
lf they do break in,
it's unlikely

37:35.152 --> 37:36.380
they'll look for anyone there.

37:38.456 --> 37:39.423
Trust me, Ensign.

37:39.523 --> 37:41.548
l won't let anyone
touch our baby.

37:41.626 --> 37:42.684
Mama will see you soon.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.126
Lieutenant, give me a hand.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.128
Move this.

37:46.197 --> 37:47.391
We're going to have to cut away

37:47.465 --> 37:48.989
the internal circuitry
to make room...

37:50.034 --> 37:51.001
Vidiians.

37:51.068 --> 37:52.228
They're using
some kind of disrupter

37:52.303 --> 37:53.930
to break down the force field.

37:57.141 --> 37:58.768
The force field's down.

38:02.079 --> 38:03.478
Commander.

38:03.547 --> 38:05.481
They've got everything
below Deck 5

38:05.549 --> 38:06.709
and l don't know
how much longer

38:06.784 --> 38:08.149
we can keep them away
from the Bridge.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.710
Mr. Kim, how many Vidiians
are there on the ship?

38:10.788 --> 38:13.018
347, and more are boarding.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.523
We're outnumbered
two to one.

38:14.592 --> 38:16.583
l've got an incoming
subspace signal.

38:16.661 --> 38:17.958
lt's from the other Voyager.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.360
They must've reestablished
the com-link.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.794
On screen.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.894
Captain, this com-link
might not last much longer.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.197
What's happening over there?

38:26.270 --> 38:27.669
We've been boarded.

38:27.738 --> 38:31.174
The Vidiians are on the verge
of taking over our ship.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.368
Are they on yours?

38:32.443 --> 38:35.105
No. We don't think
they can detect our ship.

38:35.179 --> 38:37.739
Captain, we can have
a security detachment

38:37.815 --> 38:39.339
cross the spatial rift
and board your ship

38:39.417 --> 38:41.977
within five minutes.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.419
No. lf we do that,

38:44.522 --> 38:47.958
the Vidiians might become aware
of your Voyager.

38:48.025 --> 38:50.425
That would put both ships
at risk.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.190
We can't just stand by
and let you all be killed.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.824
l'm not about
to let that happen.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.733
l'll destroy this ship.

38:58.803 --> 39:02.239
l don't suppose there's any way
l can change your mind.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.501
l know how stubborn you can be.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.203
True.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.768
But there is something else
l can do for you.

39:08.846 --> 39:11.314
l'm going to send Harry Kim
through the rift

39:11.382 --> 39:12.974
with Ensign Wildman's baby.

39:13.050 --> 39:15.610
Somehow, it seems only fair.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.813
We'll be waiting for them.

39:17.888 --> 39:20.220
Just make me a promise,
Kathryn.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.555
Get your crew home.

39:22.626 --> 39:27.086
l will.
l will.

39:30.501 --> 39:32.093
Harry, you've got five minutes.

39:32.169 --> 39:33.101
Get the baby.

39:33.170 --> 39:34.228
But, Captain...

39:34.305 --> 39:35.863
Move it, Ensign!
That's an order!

39:41.779 --> 39:45.237
Computer, initiate
the self-destruct sequence.

39:45.316 --> 39:48.615
Authorization:
Janeway-pi-one-one-zero.

39:48.686 --> 39:52.679
Set at five minutes
and mute voice warnings.

39:57.094 --> 39:58.584
Enable.

39:58.662 --> 40:00.425
Warning.

40:00.531 --> 40:03.329
Self-destruct sequence
has been initiated.

40:03.401 --> 40:07.303
Warp core overload
in four minutes, 55 seconds.

40:07.371 --> 40:10.169
There will be
no further audio warnings.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.204
Ocampa, female.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.772
The organs are healthy.

40:19.850 --> 40:22.410
She has an extremely high rate
of tissue regeneration.

40:22.486 --> 40:23.714
Extract her pelvic ridge.

40:23.788 --> 40:26.586
We'll analyze the bone marrow
for phage resistance.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.188
The others are human.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.627
My scans indicate
their pancreatic tissues

40:32.696 --> 40:34.789
are well-suited for transplant.

40:34.865 --> 40:36.025
Begin the extraction procedure.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.863
Shh.

40:40.971 --> 40:42.734
This one-- a female human.

40:42.807 --> 40:44.274
She's recently given birth.

40:44.341 --> 40:45.501
Are you certain?

40:45.643 --> 40:48.544
Yes. Her hemo-uterine levels
are far above normal.

40:48.612 --> 40:49.670
Where's the infant?

40:49.747 --> 40:52.580
Set your bio-probe
to maximum. Find it.

40:53.617 --> 40:54.709
Shh... shh, shh, shh, shh.

41:23.247 --> 41:24.646
No!

41:24.715 --> 41:27.047
Ensign Kim, is that you?

41:27.117 --> 41:28.379
Doc.

41:28.452 --> 41:29.749
Am l glad to see you.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.185
Have we retaken the ship?

41:31.255 --> 41:34.486
No. Actually, the Captain's put
the ship on self-destruct.

41:34.592 --> 41:36.924
She ordered me to take the baby
and go to the other Voyager.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.087
Well, l guess
you'd better hurry then.

41:40.531 --> 41:41.998
Good-bye, Doc.

41:42.066 --> 41:44.591
Ensign, tell my counterpart

41:44.668 --> 41:47.000
that l've corrected all
signs of hemocythemia.

41:47.071 --> 41:48.038
He'll know what that means.

41:48.105 --> 41:49.197
Will do.

41:56.146 --> 41:58.706
Hello.

41:58.782 --> 42:01.444
l'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.

42:01.552 --> 42:03.213
Welcome to the Bridge.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.846
Commander!

42:21.005 --> 42:22.267
lt's about time.

42:22.339 --> 42:23.431
Tuvok to Janeway.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.566
Ensign Kim has made it
through the rift.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.440
With the infant.

42:27.511 --> 42:29.069
Acknowledged.

42:29.146 --> 42:32.411
Captain, the Vidiian ship
has been destroyed.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.347
So has the other Voyager.

42:42.426 --> 42:46.624
Captain's Log, Stardate 49548.7.

42:46.697 --> 42:49.791
There are no signs
of any pursuing Vidiian vessels

42:49.867 --> 42:52.335
and we have resumed
a course toward home.

42:54.371 --> 42:55.736
Repair efforts are underway.

42:55.806 --> 42:57.831
Lieutenant Torres estimates
we'll be able

42:57.908 --> 42:59.967
to return to the Bridge
within three days.

43:00.077 --> 43:02.910
Good. l'm not sure how much
longer B'Elanna can tolerate

43:02.947 --> 43:05.177
my standing over her shoulder
in Engineering.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.240
Hmm.

43:07.318 --> 43:10.253
Tuvok, is there something
on your mind?

43:10.321 --> 43:12.721
l am curious, Captain.

43:12.790 --> 43:14.348
Before the Vidiians attacked,

43:14.425 --> 43:16.416
when you were in disagreement
with the other Captain about...

43:16.493 --> 43:20.259
Would l have given the order
to self-destruct our ship?

43:20.331 --> 43:23.823
l've gone over that moment
a thousand times in my mind.

43:23.901 --> 43:27.393
The truth is, yes,
l would've given the order.

43:27.471 --> 43:31.032
But l will admit,
there was a part of me

43:31.108 --> 43:33.576
that could see
her point of view.

43:33.644 --> 43:36.704
One could say that you
were both the doubter

43:36.780 --> 43:38.475
and the doubted.

43:38.549 --> 43:40.779
l do not envy
the paradox of logic

43:40.851 --> 43:43.319
you were faced with
in that situation.

43:43.387 --> 43:45.446
Neither did l.

43:45.522 --> 43:47.615
And neither did she.

44:00.504 --> 44:02.233
Thank you.

44:02.306 --> 44:04.137
Thank you so much.

44:04.208 --> 44:05.573
You're welcome.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.736
But you should also
thank the Doctor.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.905
lt was his counterpart
who saved her from the Vidiians.

44:10.981 --> 44:12.471
l'm not surprised.

44:12.549 --> 44:15.814
l am programmed to be heroic
when the need arises.

44:15.886 --> 44:18.787
By the way, Ensign,
this other Doctor--

44:18.856 --> 44:20.414
did he have a name?

44:20.491 --> 44:22.652
l really didn't
have time to ask.

44:22.726 --> 44:25.160
Am l allowed to go back to my
temporary Bridge now, Doctor?

44:25.229 --> 44:26.560
By all means.

44:35.139 --> 44:37.232
lt's good to have you back,
Ensign.

44:37.307 --> 44:38.274
Thank you.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.366
l think.

44:39.443 --> 44:40.740
Something wrong?

44:40.811 --> 44:42.039
l'm not sure.

44:42.112 --> 44:44.740
l mean, this isn't
really my ship.

44:44.815 --> 44:47.079
And you're not really
my Captain,

44:47.151 --> 44:49.619
and yet, you are,
