WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:07.128
.

02:11.499 --> 02:15.670
Fair is foul and foul is fair.

02:15.879 --> 02:20.571
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

02:24.428 --> 02:29.955
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning or in rain?

02:30.163 --> 02:35.689
When the hurlyburly's done.
When the battle's lost and won.

02:35.898 --> 02:39.130
- That would be ere the set of sun.
- Where?

02:39.339 --> 02:41.215
Upon the heath.

02:41.424 --> 02:45.803
There to meet with Macbeth.

06:14.545 --> 06:17.569
- What bloody man is that?
- Hail, friend!

06:17.569 --> 06:21.739
Say to the king thy knowledge
of the broil as thou left it.

06:21.948 --> 06:27.995
The merciless Macdonwald led
his rebellion from the Western Isles.

06:28.308 --> 06:31.227
And fortune on
his damned quarrel smiled.

06:31.540 --> 06:34.877
- But, brave Macbeth...
- He deserves that name.

06:34.981 --> 06:38.213
- Carved out a passage
till he faced the slave.

06:38.213 --> 06:41.237
And ne'er shook hands
nor bade farewell...

06:41.446 --> 06:45.408
...till he unseamed him
from the nave to the chops.

06:45.616 --> 06:47.702
Valiant cousin!

06:47.910 --> 06:51.038
Upon this chance did
the Norwegian king...

06:51.142 --> 06:54.792
...with new supplies of men,
begin a fresh assault.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.275
Dismayed not this our captains,
Macbeth and Banquo?

06:59.484 --> 07:03.863
Yes. As sparrows eagles,
or the hare the lion.

07:04.071 --> 07:08.763
So well thy words become thee as
thy wounds. They smack of honour.

07:08.972 --> 07:11.474
Go get him surgeons.

07:22.005 --> 07:25.238
- God save the king.
- What news, worthy thane?

07:25.342 --> 07:27.740
Norway, in terrible numbers...

07:27.844 --> 07:31.702
...assisted by this traitor,
the Thane of Cawdor...

07:32.015 --> 07:36.290
...began a dismal conflict till
Bellona's bridegroom, Macbeth...

07:36.498 --> 07:41.190
...confronts the king arm against arm,
curbing his lavish spirit.

07:41.399 --> 07:44.840
And to conclude,
the victory fell on us.

07:45.153 --> 07:50.783
Great happiness! No more that thane
shall deceive our bosom interest.

07:50.991 --> 07:54.328
Go pronounce his present death.

07:54.536 --> 08:00.271
And with his former title,
greet Macbeth.

09:20.974 --> 09:25.144
So foul and fair a day
I have not seen.

09:52.671 --> 09:54.756
What are these?

09:55.799 --> 09:58.614
So withered and wild
in their attire...

09:58.718 --> 10:02.159
...that look not like
inhabitants of the Earth.

10:03.619 --> 10:07.268
Speak, if you can.
What are you?

10:08.415 --> 10:14.149
All hail, Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.

10:16.026 --> 10:20.718
All hail, Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor.

10:20.927 --> 10:25.202
All hail, Macbeth,
that shall be king hereafter.

10:29.581 --> 10:34.586
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
which outwardly you show?

10:34.794 --> 10:39.069
My partner you greet with grace
and great prediction...

10:39.278 --> 10:41.676
...that he seems rapt withal.

10:42.197 --> 10:44.804
To me you speak not.

10:45.742 --> 10:48.349
If you can look into
the seeds of time...

10:48.557 --> 10:53.979
...and say which grain will grow
and which will not, speak to me...

10:54.188 --> 10:58.776
...who neither beg nor fear
your favours nor your hate.

10:59.088 --> 11:03.572
Hail! Lesser than Macbeth,
and greater.

11:03.780 --> 11:07.534
Not so happy, yet much happier.

11:07.742 --> 11:11.809
Thou shalt beget kings,
though thou be none.

11:12.017 --> 11:14.624
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.

11:14.833 --> 11:18.690
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail.

11:19.837 --> 11:24.217
Stay, you imperfect speakers!
Tell me more.

11:25.885 --> 11:30.264
By Sinel's death,
I know I am Thane of Glamis.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.288
But how of Cawdor?

11:34.018 --> 11:37.041
Say from whence you owe
this intelligence.

11:37.146 --> 11:42.985
Or why upon this heath you stop
our way with such prophetic greeting?

11:48.615 --> 11:51.326
Whither are they vanished?

11:54.662 --> 11:56.852
Into the air.

12:04.151 --> 12:09.885
And what seemed corporal melted,
as breath into the wind.

12:11.866 --> 12:15.516
Were such things here
as we do speak about?

12:16.037 --> 12:20.938
Or have we eaten of the insane root
that takes reason prisoner?

12:32.303 --> 12:34.597
Your children shall be kings.

12:34.597 --> 12:38.559
You shall be king.
And Thane of Cawdor. Went it not so?

12:38.767 --> 12:41.999
To the selfsame tune and words.

12:51.383 --> 12:54.303
The Thane of Cawdor lives.

12:55.033 --> 12:57.744
And to be king...

12:57.848 --> 13:01.810
... stands not within
the prospect of belief.

13:02.957 --> 13:05.981
No more than to be Cawdor.

13:33.820 --> 13:37.469
The king hath happily received
the news of thy success.

13:37.678 --> 13:42.474
Thick as hail came post with post,
and everyone did bear thy praises.

13:43.100 --> 13:48.834
We are sent to give thee from
our royal master thanks, not pay thee.

13:49.043 --> 13:53.214
And for an earnest of a greater
honour, he bade me call thee...

13:53.422 --> 13:56.237
...Thane of Cawdor.

13:57.489 --> 13:59.157
What?

13:59.991 --> 14:02.910
Can the devil speak true?

14:03.223 --> 14:06.872
He lives. Why do you
dress me in borrowed robes?

14:07.185 --> 14:12.503
Who was the thane lives yet,
but that life he deserves to lose.

14:12.711 --> 14:17.299
Treasons capital, confessed
and proved, have overthrown him.

14:27.934 --> 14:31.792
Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.816
The greatest is behind.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.735
Thanks for your pains.

14:43.157 --> 14:46.285
Do you not hope
your children shall be kings?

14:46.494 --> 14:50.664
Those that gave Cawdor to me,
promised no less to them.

14:51.186 --> 14:57.233
That, trusted home, might yet
enkindle you unto the crown...

14:57.442 --> 15:00.257
...besides the Thane of Cawdor.

15:02.968 --> 15:07.556
Often, to win us to our harm,
instruments of darkness tell truths.

15:07.764 --> 15:12.873
Win us with honest trifles,
to betray us in deepest consequence.

15:19.859 --> 15:23.613
This supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill...

15:23.926 --> 15:26.115
... cannot be good.

15:27.158 --> 15:33.622
If ill, why hath it given me earnest
of success, commencing in a truth?

15:34.769 --> 15:37.793
I am Thane of Cawdor.

15:41.651 --> 15:45.717
If good, why do I yield
to that suggestion...

15:45.926 --> 15:50.513
... whose horrid image doth unfix
my hair and make my seated heart...

15:50.722 --> 15:54.059
... knock at my ribs
against the use of nature?

15:55.727 --> 16:00.523
Present fears are less
than horrible imaginings.

16:00.836 --> 16:06.153
My thought, whose murder yet
is but fantastical...

16:06.362 --> 16:09.699
... shakes so my single state of man...

16:10.011 --> 16:14.078
... that function is smothered
in surmise...

16:14.286 --> 16:16.893
... and nothing is but what is not.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.841
I thank you, gentlemen.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.727
Look how our partner's rapt.

16:40.666 --> 16:45.671
If chance will have me king,
chance may crown me without my stir.

16:45.879 --> 16:50.780
Worthy Macbeth.
We stay upon your leisure.

16:54.742 --> 17:00.164
Give me your favour, my dull brain
was wrought with things forgotten.

17:00.372 --> 17:02.457
Let us to the king.

18:21.596 --> 18:24.515
Long live the king.

18:34.108 --> 18:37.549
Nothing in his life became him
like the leaving it.

18:37.757 --> 18:43.179
He threw away the dearest thing he
owed as if it were a careless trifle.

18:43.387 --> 18:47.558
There's no art to find
a mind's construction in the face.

18:47.767 --> 18:50.582
On him I built an absolute trust.

19:22.696 --> 19:26.554
"Hail, king that shalt be.

19:27.701 --> 19:30.725
This have I thought good
to deliver thee...

19:30.933 --> 19:34.478
...my dearest partner of greatness...

19:34.687 --> 19:40.526
...that thou might not be ignorant
of what greatness is promised thee.

19:41.151 --> 19:46.365
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell."

19:48.346 --> 19:51.057
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor...

19:51.265 --> 19:54.706
...and shalt be what thou art promised.

19:55.957 --> 19:58.251
Yet I do fear thy nature.

19:58.564 --> 20:04.090
It is too full of the milk of human
kindness to catch the nearest way.

20:05.550 --> 20:08.052
Thou wouldst be great...

20:08.365 --> 20:13.474
... art not without ambition, but
without the illness should attend it.

20:13.787 --> 20:17.227
What thou wouldst highly,
thou wouldst holily.

20:17.436 --> 20:21.607
Wouldst not play false,
yet wouldst wrongly win.

20:22.858 --> 20:27.863
Hie thee hither, that I may pour
my spirits in thine ear.

20:28.071 --> 20:32.450
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, Thane of Cawdor!

20:32.659 --> 20:37.559
Worthiest cousin! The sin of
my ingratitude was heavy on me.

20:37.768 --> 20:43.920
Only I have left to say, more is
thy due than more than all can pay.

20:44.962 --> 20:48.195
The service and the loyalty
I owe pays itself.

20:48.195 --> 20:50.384
Your part is to receive our duties.

20:50.593 --> 20:57.057
Welcome. I have begun to plant thee
and will labour to make thee grow.

20:57.266 --> 21:00.290
Noble Banquo,
that has no less deserved...

21:00.394 --> 21:04.147
...let me enfold thee
and hold thee to my heart.

21:04.460 --> 21:08.110
There if I grow,
the harvest is your own.

21:13.844 --> 21:19.162
Sons, kinsmen, thanes, and you
whose places are the nearest...

21:19.370 --> 21:22.915
...know we will establish our estate...

21:23.124 --> 21:26.252
...upon our eldest, Malcolm.

21:29.484 --> 21:34.802
Whom we name hereafter
the Prince of Cumberland.

21:51.797 --> 21:53.987
Hail, Prince of Cumberland!

21:54.195 --> 21:57.740
Hail, Prince of Cumberland!

21:57.949 --> 22:02.432
Go hence to Inverness
and bind us further to you.

22:05.560 --> 22:10.252
I'll go and make joyful the hearing
of my wife with your approach.

22:10.461 --> 22:15.257
- So humbly take my leave.
- My worthy Cawdor.

22:18.907 --> 22:20.992
It is a peerless kinsman.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.641
The Prince of Cumberland!

22:25.892 --> 22:30.689
That is a step on which I must
fall down, or else o'erleap.

22:31.001 --> 22:33.295
For in my way it lies.

22:33.608 --> 22:36.111
Macbeth! Macbeth!

22:38.300 --> 22:41.428
Stars, hide your fires.

22:41.741 --> 22:46.329
Let not light see my black
and deep desires.

23:26.054 --> 23:30.329
Great Glamis. Worthy Cawdor.

23:32.623 --> 23:36.794
Greater than both
by the all-hail hereafter.

23:37.002 --> 23:39.922
Thy letter transported me
beyond this present...

23:40.234 --> 23:45.552
...and I feel the future
in the instant.
My dearest love...

23:45.969 --> 23:48.889
...Duncan comes here tonight.

23:54.310 --> 23:58.898
- And when goes hence?
- Tomorrow, as he purposes.

24:05.467 --> 24:08.908
Never shall sun that morrow see.

24:17.353 --> 24:22.045
Your face is as a book
where men may read strange matters.

24:22.254 --> 24:25.069
He that's coming must be provided for.

24:25.069 --> 24:29.136
You shall put this night's
business into my dispatch.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.325
We will speak further.

24:31.325 --> 24:35.809
Look like the innocent flower,
but be the serpent under it.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.520
Leave all the rest to me.

25:41.914 --> 25:47.857
The raven croaks the fatal entrance
of Duncan under my battlements.

25:48.170 --> 25:52.966
Come, you spirits that tend on
mortal thoughts. Unsex me here.

25:53.279 --> 25:57.971
Fill me from the crown to the toe
top-full of direst cruelty.

25:58.179 --> 26:02.767
Make thick my blood. Stop up
the access and passage to remorse...

26:02.975 --> 26:07.250
... that no compunctious visitings
of nature shake my purpose.

26:12.047 --> 26:14.549
This castle hath a pleasant seat.

26:14.758 --> 26:20.492
The air nimbly and sweetly recommends
itself unto our gentle senses.

27:15.024 --> 27:19.299
Come, thick night, pall thee
in the dunnest smoke of hell...

27:19.611 --> 27:23.678
... that my keen knife
see not the wound it makes...

27:23.886 --> 27:27.431
... nor heaven peep through
the dark to cry, "Hold!"

27:50.891 --> 27:55.062
Fair and noble hostess,
we are your guest tonight.

27:55.271 --> 27:57.669
Your servant ever.

28:02.256 --> 28:04.446
Give me your hand.

28:08.304 --> 28:10.389
Conduct me to mine host.

28:10.598 --> 28:15.185
We love him highly and shall
continue our graces towards him.

29:05.546 --> 29:11.489
If it were done when 'tis done,
then 'twere well it were done quickly.

29:12.636 --> 29:17.433
If the assassination could
trammel up the consequence...

29:17.641 --> 29:22.125
... and catch,
with his surcease, success.

29:22.437 --> 29:27.964
That but this blow might be
the be-all and the end-all here.

29:28.172 --> 29:32.551
But here, upon this bank
and shoal of time...

29:32.760 --> 29:35.471
... we'd jump the life to come.

29:35.784 --> 29:39.016
Health to this household!

29:51.632 --> 29:55.073
But in these cases,
we still have judgement here...

29:55.177 --> 29:58.409
... that we but teach
bloody instructions...

29:58.618 --> 30:02.476
... which, being taught,
return to plague the inventor.

31:02.325 --> 31:05.557
He's here in double trust.

31:05.766 --> 31:09.623
First, as I am his kinsman
and his subject...

31:09.832 --> 31:12.856
... strong both against the deed.

31:14.107 --> 31:16.401
Then as his host...

31:18.173 --> 31:23.491
...who should against his murderer shut
the door, not bear the knife myself.

31:25.263 --> 31:32.249
Besides, this Duncan hath borne
his faculties so meek...

31:32.458 --> 31:35.169
... hath been so clear
in his great office...

31:35.377 --> 31:40.382
... that his virtues will plead
like angels, trumpet-tongued...

31:40.591 --> 31:44.553
... against the deep damnation
of his taking-off.

31:44.761 --> 31:51.122
And pity, like a newborn babe striding
the blast, or heaven's cherubin...

31:51.330 --> 31:56.126
... horsed upon the sightless couriers
of the air, shall blow...

31:56.335 --> 32:01.235
... the horrid deed in every eye,
that tears shall drown the wind.

32:02.278 --> 32:06.449
I have no spur to prick
the sides of my intent.

32:06.657 --> 32:09.160
But only vaulting ambition...

32:09.368 --> 32:13.539
...which o'erleaps itself
and falls on the other side.

32:13.747 --> 32:19.169
- Why have you left the chamber?
- Hath he asked for me?

32:19.378 --> 32:21.880
Know you not he has?

32:23.027 --> 32:26.468
We will proceed no further
in this business.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.098
He hath honoured me of late.

32:32.307 --> 32:36.478
And I have bought golden opinions
from all sorts of people...

32:36.686 --> 32:42.108
...which would be worn in their newest
gloss, not cast aside so soon.

32:51.700 --> 32:55.871
Was the hope drunk,
wherein you dressed yourself?

32:57.956 --> 33:00.563
Hath it slept since?

33:00.876 --> 33:06.298
And wakes it now to look so green
and pale at what it did so freely?

33:09.217 --> 33:12.971
From this time
such I account thy love.

33:22.355 --> 33:26.108
Art thou afeard to be the same
in act as in desire?

33:26.317 --> 33:33.720
Prithee, peace.
Wouldst thou live a coward, letting
"I dare not" wait upon "I would"?

33:33.928 --> 33:36.327
Like the poor cat in the adage?

33:36.639 --> 33:42.583
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares do more is none.

33:46.336 --> 33:51.341
What beast was it then, that made you
break this enterprise to me?

33:51.654 --> 33:55.303
When you durst do it,
then you were a man.

33:55.616 --> 34:00.308
To be more than what you were,
you would be so much more the man.

34:15.114 --> 34:18.242
Hail, Thane of Cawdor.

34:31.067 --> 34:33.672
If we should fail?

34:36.801 --> 34:38.678
We fail.

34:40.138 --> 34:45.143
But screw your courage to
the sticking-place and we'll not fail.

34:47.331 --> 34:51.293
Duncan's two chamberlains
will I with wine so convince...

34:51.503 --> 34:55.672
...that memory, the warder
of the brain, shall be a fume.

34:56.507 --> 34:59.323
I'll drug their possets.

35:03.181 --> 35:07.768
When in swinish sleep their drenched
natures lie as in a death...

35:07.977 --> 35:12.877
...what cannot you and I perform
upon the unguarded Duncan?

35:52.916 --> 35:55.418
Bring forth men-children only...

35:55.627 --> 36:00.840
... for thy undaunted mettle
should compose nothing but males.

37:07.883 --> 37:09.656
How goes the night?

37:09.656 --> 37:13.201
The moon is down.
I have not heard the clock.

37:13.514 --> 37:17.997
- She goes down at 12.
- I take it 'tis later, sir.

37:20.708 --> 37:22.377
Take my sword.

37:26.026 --> 37:28.528
There's husbandry in heaven.

37:28.737 --> 37:31.552
Their candles are all out.

37:33.637 --> 37:35.723
Take thee that too.

37:38.642 --> 37:43.543
A heavy summons lies like lead
upon me, and yet I would not sleep.

37:45.628 --> 37:51.675
Merciful powers, restrain the thoughts
that nature gives way to in repose.

37:51.988 --> 37:53.448
Who's there?

37:53.657 --> 37:55.533
A friend.

37:56.367 --> 37:59.808
What, sir, not yet at rest?
The king's abed.

38:00.017 --> 38:02.623
He hath been in unusual pleasure...

38:03.353 --> 38:06.377
...and sent great largess
to your offices.

38:06.586 --> 38:12.007
Being unprepared, our will
became the servant to defect.
All's well.

38:17.325 --> 38:21.287
I dreamt last night
of the three weird sisters.

38:21.600 --> 38:26.918
- To you they have showed some truth.
- I think not of them.

38:27.126 --> 38:30.254
Yet, when we can entreat
an hour to serve...

38:30.463 --> 38:35.259
...we would spend it in words upon
that business if you'd grant the time.

38:35.467 --> 38:37.761
At your kindest leisure.

38:38.074 --> 38:40.681
It shall make honour for you.

38:40.994 --> 38:45.998
So I lose none in seeking to
augment it. I shall be counselled.

38:52.359 --> 38:54.965
Good repose the while.

38:55.174 --> 38:59.344
Thanks, sir. The like to you.

39:28.748 --> 39:32.814
Is this a dagger
which I see before me...

39:33.023 --> 39:36.255
... the handle toward my hand?

39:44.596 --> 39:46.473
Come...

39:47.516 --> 39:50.018
...let me clutch thee.

39:52.729 --> 39:58.568
I have thee not,
and yet I see thee still.

39:59.506 --> 40:02.530
Art thou not, fatal vision...

40:02.739 --> 40:06.284
...sensible to feeling as to sight?

40:09.620 --> 40:11.810
Or art thou but a dagger
of the mind...

40:12.123 --> 40:16.502
...a false creation, proceeding
from the heat-oppressed brain?

40:19.943 --> 40:22.132
I see thee yet...

40:22.653 --> 40:28.388
...in form as palpable as this
which now I draw.

40:30.161 --> 40:34.540
Thou marshal'st me the way
that I was going.

40:34.748 --> 40:38.398
And such an instrument I was to use.

40:42.256 --> 40:46.113
Mine eyes are made the fools
of the other senses...

40:46.322 --> 40:49.241
...or else worth all the rest.

40:50.076 --> 40:53.099
I see thee still!

40:53.412 --> 40:57.270
And on thy blade and dudgeon,
gouts of blood...

40:57.479 --> 40:59.668
...which was not so before.

41:02.900 --> 41:05.090
There's no such thing.

41:06.237 --> 41:10.512
It is the bloody business
which informs thus to mine eyes.

41:13.953 --> 41:20.313
Now o'er the one half-world
nature seems dead...

41:22.711 --> 41:27.716
... and withered murder,
alarmed by his sentinel, the wolf...

41:28.029 --> 41:30.948
... whose howl's his watch.

41:31.157 --> 41:36.057
Thus with his stealthy pace,
with Tarquin's ravishing strides...

41:36.266 --> 41:40.749
... towards his design
moves like a ghost.

41:43.981 --> 41:47.214
Thou sure and firm-set earth...

41:47.526 --> 41:51.384
... hear not my steps,
which way they walk...

41:51.593 --> 41:55.659
... for fear the very stones prate
of my whereabouts.

42:02.332 --> 42:05.043
Hear it not, Duncan...

42:05.356 --> 42:09.527
... for it is a knell
that summons thee to heaven...

42:09.735 --> 42:11.821
... or to hell.

45:18.249 --> 45:21.482
I'm afraid they have awaked,
and 'tis not done.

45:21.690 --> 45:25.339
The attempt and not the deed
confounds us.

45:26.069 --> 45:27.842
Hark!

45:29.614 --> 45:34.202
Peace! It was the owl that shrieked...

45:34.411 --> 45:38.894
... the fatal bellman, which gives
the sternest good night.

45:39.937 --> 45:41.814
My husband?

46:06.838 --> 46:09.653
I have done the deed.

46:12.155 --> 46:14.970
Didst thou not hear a noise?

46:16.013 --> 46:18.620
I heard the owl and the crickets.

46:18.828 --> 46:21.956
- Did not you speak? Now.
- As I descended?

46:22.165 --> 46:24.980
- Ay.
- Hark!

46:25.710 --> 46:29.568
- Who lies in the second chamber?
- Donalbain.

46:34.364 --> 46:40.203
This is a sorry sight.
A foolish thought,
to say a sorry sight.

46:40.516 --> 46:45.520
Methought I heard a voice cry,
"Sleep no more.

46:45.729 --> 46:48.753
Macbeth does murder sleep."

46:50.317 --> 46:55.321
The innocent sleep, sleep that
knits up the ravelled sleave of care.

46:55.530 --> 47:01.056
The death of each day's life, sore
labour's bath, balm of hurt minds.

47:01.265 --> 47:04.705
Nature's second course,
chief nourisher in life's feast.

47:04.914 --> 47:11.170
Still it cried to all the house,
"Glamis hath murdered sleep...

47:11.587 --> 47:16.592
...and Cawdor shall sleep no more.
Macbeth shall sleep no more!"

47:16.800 --> 47:19.616
Who was it that thus cried?

47:20.763 --> 47:24.933
These deeds must not be thought
after these ways so...

47:25.142 --> 47:27.748
...it will make us mad.

47:32.023 --> 47:36.507
Get some water, and wash
this filthy witness from your hands.

47:46.621 --> 47:51.208
Why did you bring these daggers
from the place?

47:53.189 --> 47:56.109
They must lie there.

47:56.422 --> 47:58.403
I'll go no more.

47:58.611 --> 48:02.678
I am afraid of what I have done.
Look on it again I dare not.

48:02.886 --> 48:05.701
Infirm of purpose!

48:07.265 --> 48:09.664
Give me the daggers.

48:20.194 --> 48:22.593
If he do bleed...

48:23.427 --> 48:27.180
...l'll gild the faces
of the grooms withal...

48:27.389 --> 48:30.517
...for it must seem their guilt.

48:58.252 --> 49:00.754
Whence is that knocking?

49:02.527 --> 49:06.385
How is it with me,
when every noise appals me?

49:16.603 --> 49:22.233
What hands are here?
They pluck out mine eyes!

49:22.963 --> 49:27.655
Will great Neptune's ocean wash
this blood clean from my hand?

49:27.863 --> 49:31.826
No, this my hand will rather...

49:32.138 --> 49:36.413
...the multitudinous seas
incarnadine...

49:36.726 --> 49:40.063
...making the green one red.

49:45.797 --> 49:48.508
My hands are of your colour...

49:51.949 --> 49:55.807
...but I scorn to wear
a heart so white.

49:59.039 --> 50:02.271
A little water clears us of this deed.

50:04.982 --> 50:08.110
How easy is it, then!

50:15.826 --> 50:17.911
Retire we to our chamber.

50:18.016 --> 50:22.603
Get on your nightgown,
lest occasion show us to be watchers.

50:23.438 --> 50:26.253
Be not lost so poorly
in your thoughts.

50:26.461 --> 50:30.841
To know my deed,
'twere best not know myself.

50:35.428 --> 50:38.556
Wake Duncan with thy knocking!

50:38.973 --> 50:41.684
I would thou couldst.

50:52.319 --> 50:55.239
Here's a knocking indeed!

50:55.447 --> 51:00.244
If a man were porter of hell gate,
he'd have less turning the key.

51:00.556 --> 51:05.457
Who's there, in the name of Beelzebub?

51:12.547 --> 51:18.595
Knock, knock. Who's there,
in the other devil's name?

51:19.116 --> 51:24.538
Knock, knock.
Never at quiet. What are you?

51:24.746 --> 51:30.481
One that goes the primrose way
to the everlasting bonfire?

51:33.609 --> 51:37.467
I'll devil-porter it no further.

51:37.675 --> 51:40.803
This place is too cold for hell.

51:41.012 --> 51:44.453
Anon, anon!

51:48.728 --> 51:52.481
Was it so late ere you went to bed,
that you lie so late?

51:52.481 --> 51:55.922
We were carousing
till the second cock...

51:56.131 --> 51:59.988
...and drink, sir, is a great provoker
of three things.

52:00.301 --> 52:04.993
- What three things?
- Nose-painting, sleep and urine.

52:05.306 --> 52:09.685
Lechery, sir, it provokes
and it unprovokes.

52:09.998 --> 52:15.107
It provokes the desire
but takes away the performance.

52:15.316 --> 52:19.486
It makes you, it mars you,
it sets you on...

52:19.695 --> 52:24.908
...it takes you off, it persuades you,
it disheartens you...

52:25.117 --> 52:28.870
...it makes you stand to
and not stand to.

52:29.079 --> 52:32.624
- Drink gave thee the lie last night.
- That it did.

52:32.832 --> 52:36.586
- Is thy master stirring?
- Good morrow.

52:36.795 --> 52:40.131
- Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
- Not yet.

52:40.340 --> 52:45.761
He did command me to call timely.
I have almost slipped the hour.

52:47.117 --> 52:49.724
I'll bring you to him.

53:13.705 --> 53:15.582
This is the door.

53:15.790 --> 53:19.544
I'll make so bold to call,
for 'tis my appointed service.

53:23.610 --> 53:28.407
- Goes the king hence today?
- He does. He did appoint so.

53:28.719 --> 53:32.681
The night has been unruly.
Our chimneys were blown down.

53:32.890 --> 53:38.833
And, as they say, lamentings heard
in the air, strange screams of death.

53:39.042 --> 53:41.544
Some say the earth was feverous.

53:41.753 --> 53:44.985
- 'Twas a rough night.
- Oh, horror!

53:47.696 --> 53:52.284
Horror, horror! Confusion now
hath made his masterpiece!

53:52.492 --> 53:56.559
Murder hath broke open
the Lord's anointed temple.

53:56.767 --> 54:00.625
- What is it you say?
- Mean you His Majesty?

54:00.833 --> 54:03.127
Do not bid me speak.

54:03.440 --> 54:07.506
See, and then speak yourselves.

54:09.175 --> 54:11.052
Awake!

54:11.364 --> 54:15.535
Awake! Ring the alarm bell!

54:15.848 --> 54:18.767
Murder and treason!

54:18.976 --> 54:23.042
Malcolm and Donalbain!
Banquo! Awake!

54:24.085 --> 54:29.507
Shake off this downy sleep, death's
counterfeit, and look on death itself!

54:29.715 --> 54:33.469
Up! Up!
And see the great doom's image.

54:33.677 --> 54:38.578
Fleance! Banquo!
Rise up as from your graves...

54:38.786 --> 54:42.540
...and walk like spirits
to countenance this horror.

54:42.749 --> 54:44.521
Ring the bell!

55:37.176 --> 55:40.304
What's the business,
that a hideous trumpet calls...

55:40.617 --> 55:44.474
...to parley the sleepers
of the house? Speak!

55:44.683 --> 55:48.437
Gentle lady, 'tis not for you
to hear what I speak.

55:48.645 --> 55:53.441
Banquo, our royal master's murdered.

55:53.650 --> 55:55.735
Woe, alas!

55:56.361 --> 56:00.740
What, in our house?

56:00.949 --> 56:03.242
Too cruel anywhere.

56:05.015 --> 56:08.664
I prithee, contradict thyself,
and say it is not so.

56:08.873 --> 56:13.148
Had I but died before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time.

56:13.356 --> 56:16.171
There is nothing serious in mortality.

56:16.276 --> 56:19.508
All is but toys.
Renown and grace is dead.

56:19.717 --> 56:23.783
- What is amiss?
- You are, and do not know it.

56:23.991 --> 56:27.015
Your royal father's murdered.

56:35.461 --> 56:36.712
By whom?

56:36.921 --> 56:39.423
Those of his chambers, it seemed,
had done it.

56:39.631 --> 56:43.489
They were all badged with blood.
So were their daggers.

56:43.802 --> 56:48.286
O, yet I do repent me of my fury
that I did kill them.

57:02.153 --> 57:04.760
Wherefore did you so?

57:05.072 --> 57:08.096
Who can be wise, amazed,
temperate and furious...

57:08.305 --> 57:11.537
...loyal and neutral
in a moment? No man!

57:11.850 --> 57:15.082
Here lay Duncan,
his skin laced with his blood.

57:15.291 --> 57:19.774
There the murderers, steeped
in the colours of their trade.

57:19.983 --> 57:23.528
Who could refrain,
that had a heart to love?

57:23.736 --> 57:27.907
And in that heart, courage
to make his love known?

58:03.462 --> 58:08.050
Let's briefly put on manly readiness
and meet in the hall together...

58:08.258 --> 58:12.533
...to question
this most bloody piece of work.

58:13.367 --> 58:15.974
Fears and scruples shake us.

58:16.182 --> 58:19.206
In the great hand of God I stand.

58:19.415 --> 58:23.794
Against the undivulged pretence
I fight of treasonous malice.

58:24.002 --> 58:27.130
- So do I.
- So all.

58:31.614 --> 58:34.220
What will you do?

58:34.429 --> 58:37.557
Let's not consort with them.

58:37.870 --> 58:41.728
- I'll to England.
- To Ireland, I.

58:42.040 --> 58:46.211
Our separated fortune shall
keep us both the safer.

58:46.420 --> 58:49.756
Where we are,
there's daggers in men's smiles.

58:49.965 --> 58:54.865
This murderous shaft that's shot
hath not yet lighted.

58:56.742 --> 58:58.515
Therefore to horse.

59:00.600 --> 59:04.666
And let us not be dainty
of leave-taking.

59:08.003 --> 59:10.088
Shift away.

59:47.311 --> 59:52.629
- How goes the world, Macduff?
- Why? See you not?

59:52.837 --> 59:56.591
Is it known who did
this more than bloody deed?

59:58.885 --> 01:00:04.203
- Those that Macbeth hath slain.
- What good could they expect?

01:00:04.411 --> 01:00:10.563
They were suborned. Malcolm and
Donalbain, the king's sons, are fled...

01:00:10.876 --> 01:00:14.316
...which puts upon them
suspicion of the deed.

01:00:14.838 --> 01:00:18.696
Then 'tis most like the sovereignty
will fall upon Macbeth.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.345
He's already named
and gone to Scone to be invested.

01:00:22.553 --> 01:00:26.620
- Will you to Scone?
- No, cousin, I'll home to Fife.

01:00:26.828 --> 01:00:29.122
Well, I will thither.

01:00:30.582 --> 01:00:34.961
May you see things well done there.
Adieu.

01:00:59.151 --> 01:01:01.445
Thou hast it now.

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:05.928
King, Cawdor, Glamis...

01:01:06.137 --> 01:01:09.578
... all as the weird women promised.

01:01:10.516 --> 01:01:14.791
And I fear thou play'dst
most foully for it.

01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:25.948
Yet it was said it should not
stand in thy posterity.

01:01:26.156 --> 01:01:30.744
But that myself should be
the root and father of many kings.

01:01:30.952 --> 01:01:34.185
If there comes truth from them...

01:01:34.393 --> 01:01:37.625
... may they not be
my oracles as well...

01:01:37.834 --> 01:01:40.649
... and set me up in hope?

01:01:45.028 --> 01:01:49.929
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, King of Scotland!

01:01:50.137 --> 01:01:54.934
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, King of Scotland!

01:02:14.119 --> 01:02:17.038
Here's our chief guest.

01:02:17.247 --> 01:02:21.939
If he had been forgotten, it'd have
been a gap in our great feast.

01:02:26.735 --> 01:02:30.906
Tonight we hold a solemn supper,
and I'll request your presence.

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:33.721
Let Your Highness command upon me...

01:02:33.825 --> 01:02:39.247
...to the which my duties are with
a most indissoluble tie forever knit.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.688
- Ride you this afternoon?
- Ay, my lord.

01:02:42.896 --> 01:02:44.773
Is it far you ride?

01:02:44.982 --> 01:02:49.465
As far as will fill up the time
'twixt this and supper.

01:02:49.674 --> 01:02:53.636
- Fail not our feast.
- My lord, I will not.

01:02:57.077 --> 01:03:00.309
We hear our bloody cousins are
in England and Ireland...

01:03:00.622 --> 01:03:03.541
...not confessing
their cruel parricide.

01:03:03.645 --> 01:03:08.650
But of that tomorrow. Hie you to
horse. Adieu till you return at night.

01:03:10.735 --> 01:03:13.551
- Goes Fleance with you?
- Ay, my lord.

01:03:13.759 --> 01:03:19.181
I wish your horses swift
and sure of foot. Farewell.

01:03:27.939 --> 01:03:33.048
- Attend those men our leisure?
- They do.
Bring them before us.

01:03:34.195 --> 01:03:39.304
To be thus is nothing,
but to be safely thus.

01:03:39.513 --> 01:03:43.788
Our fears in Banquo stick deep.
In his royalty of nature...

01:03:43.996 --> 01:03:48.688
...he hath a wisdom that doth guide
his valour to act in safety.

01:03:48.897 --> 01:03:51.921
There is none but he
whose being do I fear.

01:03:51.921 --> 01:03:55.674
And under him my genius is rebuked.

01:04:00.262 --> 01:04:05.580
We'll keep ourself till suppertime
alone. Till then, God be with you.

01:04:08.499 --> 01:04:13.295
He chid the sisters, when first
they put the name of king upon me...

01:04:13.504 --> 01:04:16.840
... and bade them speak to him.

01:04:17.049 --> 01:04:20.594
Then, prophet-like they hailed him...

01:04:20.907 --> 01:04:24.035
... father to a line of kings.

01:04:24.243 --> 01:04:26.954
Upon my head,
they placed a fruitless crown...

01:04:27.267 --> 01:04:30.187
... and put a barren sceptre
in my grip.

01:04:30.395 --> 01:04:36.026
Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal
hand, no son of mine succeeding.

01:04:37.172 --> 01:04:39.362
If it be so...

01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:43.116
... for Banquo's sons
have I defiled my mind.

01:04:43.324 --> 01:04:47.912
For them the gracious Duncan
have I murdered.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:53.751
To make them kings.
The seeds of Banquo kings.

01:05:06.888 --> 01:05:08.974
Stay within call.

01:05:10.538 --> 01:05:15.125
- Was it not yesterday we spoke?
- It was, Your Highness.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:25.761
Well then now, have you
considered of my speeches?

01:05:25.969 --> 01:05:30.348
Know that it was he in times past
which held you under fortune...

01:05:30.557 --> 01:05:35.875
...which you thought had been
our innocent self.
You made this known to us.

01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:42.443
Is patience so predominant in
your nature that you can let this go?

01:05:42.652 --> 01:05:47.135
Are you so gospelled to pray
for this man and for his issue...

01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:52.661
...whose heavy hand has bowed you to
the grave and beggared yours forever?

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.771
We are men, my liege.

01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:03.505
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men.

01:06:04.235 --> 01:06:09.448
As hounds and greyhounds,
mongrels, spaniels, curs, shoughs...

01:06:09.657 --> 01:06:14.662
...water-rugs and demi-wolves are
clept, all by the name of dogs.

01:06:14.974 --> 01:06:17.373
And so of men.

01:06:22.899 --> 01:06:27.174
Now, if you have a station
in the file...

01:06:27.486 --> 01:06:32.908
...not in the worst rank
of manhood, say it.

01:06:33.117 --> 01:06:36.558
And I will put that business
in your bosoms...

01:06:37.288 --> 01:06:40.311
...whose execution takes
your enemy off...

01:06:40.624 --> 01:06:43.856
...grapples you to the heart
and love of us...

01:06:43.856 --> 01:06:47.401
...who wear our health
but sickly in his life...

01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:50.321
...which in his death were perfect.

01:06:50.634 --> 01:06:55.534
I am one whom the vile blows and
buffets of the world have so incensed...

01:06:55.847 --> 01:06:59.601
...that I am reckless what I do
to spite the world.

01:06:59.913 --> 01:07:01.790
And I another.

01:07:02.103 --> 01:07:04.501
Both of you know
Banquo was your enemy.

01:07:04.814 --> 01:07:08.255
- Ay, my lord.
- So is he mine!

01:07:09.506 --> 01:07:13.885
Though I could with barefaced power
sweep him from my sight...

01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:17.326
...and bid my will avouch it.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:20.767
Yet I must not, for certain friends...

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:26.814
...that are both his and mine,
whose loves I may not drop.

01:07:27.023 --> 01:07:31.715
And thence it is, that I to
your assistance do make love...

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:37.241
...masking the business from the
common eye for sundry weighty reasons.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:43.705
- We shall perform what you command.
- Your spirits shine through you.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:50.170
It must be done tonight,
and some way from the palace.

01:07:50.378 --> 01:07:54.549
And with him, to leave no rubs
nor botches in the work...

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:59.033
...Fleance, his son
that keeps him company...

01:07:59.345 --> 01:08:04.142
...whose absence is no less material
to me than is his father's...

01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:08.208
...must embrace the fate
of that dark hour.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:20.407
- Resolve yourselves apart.
- We are resolved, my lord.

01:08:25.099 --> 01:08:28.122
Advise them where
to plant themselves.

01:10:01.963 --> 01:10:04.674
How now, my lord?

01:10:08.115 --> 01:10:10.930
Why do you keep alone...

01:10:11.243 --> 01:10:15.935
...of sorriest fancies
your companions making?

01:10:16.143 --> 01:10:21.669
Things without all remedy should be
without regard. What's done is done.

01:10:23.859 --> 01:10:28.238
We have scorched the snake,
not killed it.

01:10:30.532 --> 01:10:35.328
But let the frame of things disjoint.
Ere we'll eat our meal in fear...

01:10:35.641 --> 01:10:41.584
...and sleep in the affliction of the
terrible dreams that shake us nightly.

01:10:42.835 --> 01:10:45.025
Better be with the dead...

01:10:45.234 --> 01:10:50.343
...than on the torture of the mind
to lie in restless ecstasy.

01:10:52.428 --> 01:10:54.722
Duncan is in his grave.

01:10:54.930 --> 01:11:00.039
After life's fitful fever,
he sleeps well.

01:11:00.248 --> 01:11:03.272
Treason has done his worst.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.817
Not steel, nor poison...

01:11:07.025 --> 01:11:11.717
...malice domestic, foreign levy,
nothing can touch him further.

01:11:11.926 --> 01:11:15.471
Come on. Gentle, my lord.

01:11:15.784 --> 01:11:19.120
Sleek o'er your rugged looks.

01:11:19.954 --> 01:11:24.125
Be bright and jovial
among your guests tonight.

01:11:25.689 --> 01:11:28.296
So shall I, love.

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:31.841
And so, I pray, be you.

01:11:49.566 --> 01:11:54.049
Full of scorpions is my mind,
dear wife.

01:11:59.263 --> 01:12:03.329
Thou knowst that Banquo
and his Fleance live.

01:12:05.936 --> 01:12:09.585
But in them nature's copy
is not eterne.

01:12:10.941 --> 01:12:16.258
There's comfort yet.
They are assailable.

01:12:18.656 --> 01:12:21.472
Then be thou jocund.

01:12:23.244 --> 01:12:26.581
Ere the bat hath flown
his cloistered flight...

01:12:26.789 --> 01:12:29.396
...ere to black Hecate's summons...

01:12:29.396 --> 01:12:35.339
...the shard-borne beetle
with his drowsy hums...
...hath rung night's yawning peal...

01:12:35.548 --> 01:12:40.448
...there shall be done a deed
of dreadful note.

01:12:40.969 --> 01:12:43.368
What's to be done?

01:12:47.955 --> 01:12:53.586
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest
chuck, till thou applaud the deed.

01:12:59.529 --> 01:13:02.657
Come, seeling night...

01:13:02.865 --> 01:13:07.140
...scarf up the tender eye
of pitiful day.

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:12.458
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
cancel and tear to pieces...

01:13:12.771 --> 01:13:16.629
...that great bond
which keeps me pale.

01:13:18.922 --> 01:13:24.344
Light thickens, and the crow
makes wing to the rooky wood.

01:13:24.970 --> 01:13:29.766
Good things of day begin
to droop and drowse...

01:13:29.975 --> 01:13:34.250
...while night's black agents
to their prey do rouse.

01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:53.748
- Who did bid thee join with us?
- Macbeth.

01:13:54.999 --> 01:13:59.065
He needs not our mistrust
since he delivers our offices...

01:13:59.378 --> 01:14:03.236
...and what we have to do
to the direction just.

01:14:03.549 --> 01:14:08.970
Well, stand with us. The west yet
glimmers with some streaks of day.

01:14:09.179 --> 01:14:12.307
And near approaches
the subject of our watch.

01:14:20.335 --> 01:14:22.734
By the clock 'tis day...

01:14:22.942 --> 01:14:27.009
...and yet dark night strangles
the travelling lamp.

01:14:27.217 --> 01:14:31.388
Is it night's predominance
or the day's shame...

01:14:31.596 --> 01:14:37.435
...that darkness does
the face of earth entomb...
...when living light should kiss it?

01:14:37.644 --> 01:14:40.250
It will be rain tonight.

01:14:41.814 --> 01:14:44.630
Let it come down!

01:14:47.236 --> 01:14:48.905
Treachery!

01:15:25.502 --> 01:15:28.734
Fly, good Fleance, fly!

01:15:31.028 --> 01:15:32.905
Fly!

01:15:39.891 --> 01:15:41.663
Fly!

01:16:34.214 --> 01:16:37.133
There's blood upon thy face.

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:42.659
- 'Tis Banquo's then.
- Is he despatched?

01:16:42.659 --> 01:16:45.892
His throat is cut.
That I did for him.

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:51.418
Thou art the best of the cutthroats.
Yet he's good that did
the like for Fleance.

01:16:51.626 --> 01:16:54.650
If thou didst that,
thou art the nonpareil.

01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:58.404
Most royal sir, Fleance is escaped.

01:16:59.655 --> 01:17:02.887
Then comes my fit again.

01:17:03.096 --> 01:17:07.788
I had else been perfect, whole as
the marble, founded as the rock.

01:17:07.996 --> 01:17:13.418
But now I am cabined, confined,
bound in to saucy doubts and fears.

01:17:13.627 --> 01:17:15.816
- But Banquo's safe?
- Ay, my good lord.

01:17:16.025 --> 01:17:21.029
Safe in a ditch he bides,
with 20 trenched gashes on his head.

01:17:21.968 --> 01:17:25.200
There the grown serpent lies.

01:17:25.409 --> 01:17:30.205
The worm that's fled hath nature
that in time will venom breed.

01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:32.812
No teeth for the present.

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:37.608
Get thee gone.
Tomorrow we'll hear ourselves again.

01:18:46.841 --> 01:18:52.263
You know your own degrees. Sit down.
At first and last, a hearty welcome.

01:18:52.471 --> 01:18:54.557
Thanks to Your Majesty.

01:18:54.765 --> 01:18:57.059
Our hostess keeps her state.

01:18:57.163 --> 01:19:02.272
Ourself will mingle with society
and play the humble host.

01:19:02.481 --> 01:19:08.007
- My lord, you do not give the cheer.
- Sweet remembrancer.

01:19:14.054 --> 01:19:18.329
I drink to the general joy
of the whole table...

01:19:18.538 --> 01:19:24.898
...and to our dear friend Banquo,
whom we miss. Would he were here.

01:19:25.107 --> 01:19:27.401
Banquo!

01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:32.927
Now good digestion wait on
appetite, and health on both!

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:36.055
May it please Your Highness, sit.

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:45.022
Please it Your Highness to grace us
with your royal company?

01:19:46.273 --> 01:19:50.756
- The table's full.
- Here is a place reserved, sir.

01:19:50.965 --> 01:19:53.467
- Where?
- Here, my good lord.

01:20:23.705 --> 01:20:29.439
- Which of you have done this?
- What, my lord?
Thou canst not say I did it.

01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:35.591
- Never shake thy gory locks at me.
- His Highness is not well.

01:20:35.904 --> 01:20:40.179
Sit, friends. My lord is often thus
and hath been from his youth.

01:20:40.387 --> 01:20:46.226
Keep seat. The fit is momentary.
Upon a thought he will again be well.

01:20:47.477 --> 01:20:49.041
Are you a man?

01:20:49.146 --> 01:20:53.629
Ay, a bold one that dare look
on that which might appal the devil.

01:20:53.838 --> 01:20:55.506
O, proper stuff!

01:20:55.714 --> 01:20:58.217
This is the very painting
of your fear.

01:20:58.425 --> 01:21:03.534
This is the air-drawn dagger you said
led you to Duncan. Shame itself!

01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:09.686
Why do you make such faces? When
all's done, you look but on a stool.

01:21:09.895 --> 01:21:13.335
Prithee, see there!
Behold! Look! How say you?

01:21:13.544 --> 01:21:18.862
Avaunt, and quit my sight! Thy bones
are marrowless, thy blood is cold.

01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:23.971
Thou hast no speculation in those
eyes which thou dost glare with.

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:26.160
What man dare, I dare.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:30.957
Take any shape but that,
and my nerves shall never tremble.

01:21:31.165 --> 01:21:35.023
Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, hence!

01:21:38.881 --> 01:21:40.653
What?

01:21:41.383 --> 01:21:44.407
Quite unmanned in folly.

01:21:57.753 --> 01:22:02.445
- Lf I stand here, I saw him.
- Fie, for shame!

01:22:04.113 --> 01:22:07.554
Blood hath been shed ere now,
in the olden time.

01:22:07.763 --> 01:22:12.350
And since too, murders have been
performed too terrible for the ear.

01:22:12.559 --> 01:22:16.625
Time has been that when the brains
were out, a man would die...

01:22:16.625 --> 01:22:18.502
...and there an end.

01:22:18.606 --> 01:22:24.132
But now they rise again, with
20 mortal gashes on their crowns.

01:22:24.341 --> 01:22:30.180
You've displaced the mirth, broke the
meeting with most admired disorder.

01:22:34.455 --> 01:22:38.626
Can such things be and overwhelm us
like a summer's cloud...

01:22:38.834 --> 01:22:41.336
...without our special wonder?

01:22:41.649 --> 01:22:46.967
You make me strange, even
to the disposition that I owe.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.929
When now I think
you can behold such sights...

01:22:51.138 --> 01:22:55.412
...and keep the natural ruby
of your cheeks...

01:22:56.247 --> 01:22:59.270
...when mine is blanched with fear.

01:22:59.479 --> 01:23:02.815
What sights, my lord?

01:23:05.422 --> 01:23:08.759
I pray you, speak not,
he grows worse and worse.

01:23:08.759 --> 01:23:12.199
Question enrages him.
At once, good night.

01:23:13.972 --> 01:23:18.038
Stand not upon the order of
your going, but go at once.

01:23:19.811 --> 01:23:24.190
Good night. And better health
attend His Majesty.

01:23:24.399 --> 01:23:27.318
Kind good night to all.

01:23:27.735 --> 01:23:32.219
It will have blood.
They say blood will have blood.

01:23:32.427 --> 01:23:36.806
Stones have been known to move
and trees to speak.

01:24:16.323 --> 01:24:18.513
What is the night?

01:24:20.181 --> 01:24:25.290
Almost at odds with morning,
which is which.

01:24:42.181 --> 01:24:47.395
How sayst thou, that Macduff denies
his person at our great bidding?

01:24:47.603 --> 01:24:50.418
How know you this, my lord?

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:53.651
I hear it by the way.

01:24:53.859 --> 01:24:58.968
There's not a one of them, but
in his house I keep a servant paid.

01:25:03.869 --> 01:25:08.144
You lack the season
of all natures, sleep.

01:25:09.186 --> 01:25:12.523
Come, we'll to sleep.

01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:37.651
I must again to the weird sisters.
More shall they speak.

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:42.969
For now I am bent to know,
by the worst means, the worst.

01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:47.661
For mine own good,
all causes shall give way.

01:25:50.268 --> 01:25:54.751
I'm in blood, stepped in so far
that should I wade no more...

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.922
...returning were
as tedious as go o'er.

01:26:01.528 --> 01:26:06.637
Strange things I have in head
that will to hand...

01:26:06.846 --> 01:26:11.434
...which must be acted,
ere they may be scanned.

01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:17.168
We are yet but young in deed.

01:27:51.947 --> 01:27:58.411
By the pricking of my thumbs,
something wicked this way comes.

01:28:00.601 --> 01:28:04.876
How now, you secret, black and
midnight hags? What is it you do?

01:28:05.084 --> 01:28:07.065
A deed without a name.

01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:12.070
Double, double, toil and trouble.
Fire burn, cauldron bubble.

01:28:12.279 --> 01:28:16.449
Toad that under cold stone,
days and nights has 31.

01:28:16.762 --> 01:28:22.184
Sweltered venom sleeping got,
boil thou first in the charmed pot.

01:28:22.392 --> 01:28:27.919
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
wool of bat and tongue of dog.

01:28:28.127 --> 01:28:33.758
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting,
lizard's leg and howlet's wing.

01:28:33.966 --> 01:28:39.179
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
slivered in the moon's eclipse.

01:28:39.388 --> 01:28:44.288
Fillet of a fenny snake,
in the cauldron boil and bake.

01:28:44.497 --> 01:28:49.919
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
gall of goat and slips of yew.

01:28:50.127 --> 01:28:54.194
I conjure you, by that which you
profess, howe'er you know it.

01:28:54.194 --> 01:28:57.218
- Answer me to what I ask you.
- Speak!

01:28:57.426 --> 01:28:59.511
- Demand.
- We'll answer.

01:28:59.616 --> 01:29:05.246
Say if thou'dst hear it from
our mouths, or from our masters.

01:29:05.455 --> 01:29:08.270
Call them, let me see them.

01:29:17.341 --> 01:29:24.014
Cool it with a baboon's blood,
then the charm is firm and good.

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:11.768
- Tell me, unknown power...
- He knows thy thought.
Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth.

01:30:11.977 --> 01:30:15.835
Beware Macduff.
Beware the Thane of Fife.

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:18.858
Thou hast harped my fear aright.

01:30:19.171 --> 01:30:23.029
- But one word more...
- He will not be commanded.

01:30:36.062 --> 01:30:42.005
Be bloody, bold and resolute.
Laugh to scorn the power of man.

01:30:42.214 --> 01:30:45.238
For none of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.

01:30:45.342 --> 01:30:49.513
None of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.

01:30:50.555 --> 01:30:54.205
Then live Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?

01:30:54.413 --> 01:30:59.731
But I'll make assurance double sure
and take a bond of fate.

01:31:00.044 --> 01:31:02.859
Thou shalt not live!

01:31:16.101 --> 01:31:20.584
- Macbeth shall never vanquished be.
- Never, never.

01:31:20.793 --> 01:31:23.086
Until Great Birnam Wood...

01:31:23.399 --> 01:31:28.300
...to high Dunsinane Hill
shall come against him.

01:31:34.347 --> 01:31:39.352
That will never be!
Who can recruit the forest?

01:31:39.561 --> 01:31:43.106
Bid the tree unfix
his earth-bound root?

01:31:43.314 --> 01:31:46.442
Sweet bodements, good!

01:31:48.215 --> 01:31:51.447
Yet my heart throbs
to know one thing:

01:31:51.656 --> 01:31:56.243
- Shall Banquo's issue ever reign?
- Seek to know no more.

01:31:56.452 --> 01:32:01.978
I will be satisfied! Deny me this
and an eternal curse fall on you!

01:32:03.959 --> 01:32:09.798
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo.
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs.

01:32:30.964 --> 01:32:35.135
What, will the line stretch out
to the crack of doom?

01:32:35.343 --> 01:32:37.533
Now I see 'tis true.

01:32:39.201 --> 01:32:43.059
For the blood-boltered Banquo
smiles upon me...

01:32:43.267 --> 01:32:46.500
...and points at them for his!

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:12.671
Where are they?

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:19.344
Gone!

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:41.135
Infected be the air whereon they ride!

01:33:41.344 --> 01:33:44.368
And damned all those that trust them!

01:34:08.453 --> 01:34:10.747
Macduff is fled.

01:34:12.937 --> 01:34:16.690
- Where does he bestow himself?
- In the English court.

01:34:17.003 --> 01:34:19.088
Where lives the son of Duncan.

01:34:19.297 --> 01:34:23.572
Thither Macduff is gone to pray
the holy king upon his aid...

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:27.951
...to wake Northumberland
and warlike Seyward.

01:34:29.515 --> 01:34:33.582
By the help of these, we may again
give to our tables meat...

01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:39.003
...sleep to our nights,
our feasts free from bloody knives.

01:34:39.212 --> 01:34:41.923
Some holy angel fly to England...

01:34:42.131 --> 01:34:47.240
...that a swift blessing may soon
return to this, our suffering country.

01:34:49.951 --> 01:34:52.037
Gentle lady.

01:34:54.122 --> 01:34:57.042
Gracious Duncan's dead.

01:35:03.923 --> 01:35:07.781
Gracious Duncan was pitied
of Macbeth. Marry, he was dead.

01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:10.700
The valiant Banquo walked too late.

01:35:10.909 --> 01:35:14.454
Whom, you may say, Fleance killed,
for Fleance fled.

01:35:14.558 --> 01:35:17.374
Man must not walk too late.

01:35:17.582 --> 01:35:21.961
How monstrous it was for Malcolm
and Donalbain to kill their father.

01:35:22.066 --> 01:35:25.089
Damned, indeed.
How it did grieve Macbeth.

01:35:25.298 --> 01:35:30.824
- Had he Duncan's sons under his key...
- As, an't please heaven, he shall not.

01:35:31.032 --> 01:35:34.265
They should find what
it were to kill a father.

01:35:34.265 --> 01:35:36.454
So should Fleance.

01:35:36.767 --> 01:35:38.331
Peace.

01:35:45.630 --> 01:35:47.089
What news?

01:35:52.824 --> 01:35:56.369
Macduff is fled to England.

01:35:56.578 --> 01:36:00.019
- Fled to England?
- Ay, my good lord.

01:36:00.748 --> 01:36:05.023
Time, thou anticipat'st
my dread exploits.

01:36:30.464 --> 01:36:35.261
The castle of Macduff
I will surprise. Seize upon Fife.

01:36:35.469 --> 01:36:39.431
Give to the edge of the sword
his wife, his babes...

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.645
... and all unfortunate souls
that trace him in his line.

01:36:44.853 --> 01:36:47.043
No boasting like a fool.

01:36:47.251 --> 01:36:51.109
This deed I'll do
before the purpose cool.

01:37:03.621 --> 01:37:05.602
You must have patience.

01:37:05.602 --> 01:37:09.981
He had none. His flight was madness.
Our fears do make us traitors.

01:37:10.190 --> 01:37:13.005
You know not if it was wisdom or fear.

01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:18.948
To leave his wife and his babes in
a place from whence himself does fly?

01:37:19.261 --> 01:37:23.119
He loves us not.
He wants a natural touch.

01:37:23.328 --> 01:37:26.664
The wren, the most diminutive bird,
will fight...

01:37:26.664 --> 01:37:29.062
...her young in the nest,
against the owl.

01:37:29.271 --> 01:37:34.901
- All is the fear, nothing is the love.
- Dear coz, pray, school yourself.

01:37:35.735 --> 01:37:39.385
But for your husband,
he is noble, wise, judicious...

01:37:39.593 --> 01:37:42.617
...and best knows the fits
of the season.

01:37:43.555 --> 01:37:48.247
I take my leave of you. Shall not
be long but I'll be here again.

01:37:48.456 --> 01:37:51.167
Things at their worst will cease...

01:37:51.375 --> 01:37:54.920
...or else climb upward
to what they were before.

01:37:57.214 --> 01:38:01.385
My pretty cousin,
blessing upon you.

01:38:01.593 --> 01:38:04.721
Fathered he is,
and yet he's fatherless.

01:38:04.930 --> 01:38:07.745
I take my leave at once.

01:38:56.542 --> 01:39:00.295
- How wilt thou do for a father?
- How will you do for a husband?

01:39:00.504 --> 01:39:04.570
Why, I can buy me 20 at any market.

01:39:08.324 --> 01:39:12.495
- Was my father a traitor?
- Ay, that he was.

01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:18.021
- What is a traitor?
- Why, one that swears and lies.

01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:20.419
Be all traitors that do so?

01:39:20.523 --> 01:39:24.485
Everyone that does so is a traitor
and must be hanged.

01:39:24.694 --> 01:39:27.196
- Who must hang them?
- The honest men.

01:39:27.405 --> 01:39:33.348
The liars are fools, for there are
enough of them to hang the honest men.

01:39:33.557 --> 01:39:38.978
- God help thee, poor monkey.
- Lf he were dead, you'd weep for him.

01:40:29.026 --> 01:40:31.007
Where's your husband?

01:40:31.216 --> 01:40:36.846
I hope in no place so unsanctified,
where such as thou mayst find him.

01:40:37.993 --> 01:40:40.600
He's a traitor.

01:40:42.477 --> 01:40:47.586
- Thou liest, thou shag-eared villain!
- What, you egg?

01:40:49.567 --> 01:40:52.799
Young fry of treachery!

01:40:59.159 --> 01:41:02.079
He has killed me, Mother.

01:41:51.084 --> 01:41:57.757
Besides her walking and other actual
performances, what has she said?

01:41:57.966 --> 01:42:04.535
That which I will not report after her.
You may to a doctor.
'Tis most meet you should.

01:42:04.743 --> 01:42:11.208
Neither to you, nor anyone, having
no witness to confirm my speech.

01:42:21.634 --> 01:42:26.326
- Her eyes are open.
- Ay, but their sense is shut.

01:42:31.748 --> 01:42:35.189
- What is it she does now?
- An accustomed action.

01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:38.421
To seem thus washing her hands.

01:42:54.895 --> 01:42:56.981
Yet here's a spot.

01:42:59.587 --> 01:43:02.507
Out, damned spot.

01:43:02.715 --> 01:43:05.322
Out, I say!

01:43:08.554 --> 01:43:10.118
One.

01:43:11.786 --> 01:43:13.455
Two.

01:43:15.227 --> 01:43:18.251
Why then 'tis time to do it.

01:43:21.379 --> 01:43:23.986
Hell is murky.

01:43:24.403 --> 01:43:28.990
Fie, my lord, fie!
A soldier and afeard?

01:43:29.199 --> 01:43:33.787
What need we fear who knows it, when
none can call our power to account?

01:43:36.289 --> 01:43:40.877
Yet who'd have thought the old man
to have so much blood in him?

01:43:41.085 --> 01:43:43.066
Well, well!

01:43:43.275 --> 01:43:46.507
The Thane of Fife had a wife.

01:43:47.446 --> 01:43:50.052
Where is she now?

01:43:52.346 --> 01:43:55.996
What, will these hands
ne'er be clean?

01:43:56.830 --> 01:44:01.105
No more of that, my lord.
You mar all with this starting.

01:44:01.417 --> 01:44:03.920
Go to. You have known
what you should not.

01:44:04.128 --> 01:44:08.508
She has spoke what she should not,
I am sure of that.

01:44:09.133 --> 01:44:12.782
Here's the smell of blood still.

01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:21.645
All the perfumes of Arabia will not
sweeten this little hand.

01:44:27.901 --> 01:44:33.010
What a sigh is there!
The heart is sorely charged.

01:44:33.427 --> 01:44:37.702
Wash your hands,
put on your nightgown.

01:44:37.911 --> 01:44:40.309
Look not so pale.

01:44:40.517 --> 01:44:44.479
I tell you, Banquo's buried.
He cannot come out of his grave.

01:44:44.584 --> 01:44:46.565
Even so?

01:44:48.233 --> 01:44:51.674
To bed, to bed.

01:44:51.882 --> 01:44:54.802
Come. Come.

01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:58.034
Come, give me your hand.

01:44:58.243 --> 01:45:01.683
What's done cannot be undone.

01:45:01.892 --> 01:45:05.646
To bed, to bed.

01:45:08.044 --> 01:45:11.589
More needs she the divine
than the physician.

01:45:11.797 --> 01:45:15.968
God! God forgive us all.

01:45:16.698 --> 01:45:22.745
Look after her. Remove from her means
of annoyance and keep eyes upon her.

01:45:23.162 --> 01:45:26.707
- Good night.
- Good night, good doctor.

01:45:43.286 --> 01:45:45.684
How does your patient, doctor?

01:45:45.893 --> 01:45:51.836
Not so sick, as she's troubled with
fancies that keep her from her sleep.

01:45:52.044 --> 01:45:53.921
Cure her of that.

01:45:59.239 --> 01:46:02.888
Canst thou not minister
to a mind diseased?

01:46:03.201 --> 01:46:06.329
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow?

01:46:06.537 --> 01:46:10.708
Raze out the written troubles
of the brain?

01:46:11.334 --> 01:46:16.338
And with some sweet,
oblivious antidote...

01:46:16.547 --> 01:46:22.386
...cleanse the bosom of that perilous
stuff which weighs upon the heart?

01:46:22.594 --> 01:46:27.286
Therein the patient
must minister to himself.

01:46:29.059 --> 01:46:31.978
Throw physic to the dogs.

01:47:43.818 --> 01:47:48.510
Bring me no more reports.
Let them fly. All!

01:47:48.719 --> 01:47:54.349
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear.

01:47:54.557 --> 01:47:59.875
What's the boy, Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?

01:48:17.392 --> 01:48:21.771
The spirits that know all mortal
consequences pronounced me thus:

01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:28.027
"Fear not. No man that's born of woman
shall e'er have power upon thee."

01:48:28.861 --> 01:48:31.259
Then fly, false thanes...

01:48:31.468 --> 01:48:35.534
...and mingle
with the English epicures!

01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:13.592
Our country sinks beneath the yoke.
It weeps, it bleeds.

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.492
And each new day
a gash is added to her wounds.

01:49:18.805 --> 01:49:23.184
Each new morn new widows howl,
new orphans cry.

01:49:23.393 --> 01:49:26.312
New sorrows strike heaven
on the face...

01:49:26.312 --> 01:49:29.649
...that it resounds as if
it felt with Scotland.

01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:38.198
Who comes here?

01:49:42.578 --> 01:49:46.436
A countryman
who seems a stranger to us.

01:49:51.962 --> 01:49:54.464
My ever gentle cousin.

01:49:57.384 --> 01:49:59.469
Welcome hither.

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:10.625
- Stands Scotland where it did?
- Alas, poor country.

01:50:10.730 --> 01:50:16.256
Afraid to know itself. It cannot
be called our mother, but our grave.

01:50:16.986 --> 01:50:21.365
- What's the newest grief?
- Each minute teems a new one.

01:50:21.573 --> 01:50:24.597
- How does my wife?
- Well.

01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:26.578
- And my children?
- Well too.

01:50:26.787 --> 01:50:32.313
- The tyrant has not battered at them?
- No. They were well at peace.

01:50:33.251 --> 01:50:36.171
Be not a niggard of speech.
How goes it?

01:50:36.379 --> 01:50:40.550
Your eye in Scotland will create
soldiers, make our women fight.

01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:43.052
We are coming thither.

01:50:47.119 --> 01:50:53.166
Gracious England hath lent us
good Seyward and 10,000 men.

01:51:03.801 --> 01:51:08.389
An older and a better soldier none
that Christendom gives out.

01:51:17.877 --> 01:51:21.214
Would I could answer
this comfort with the like.

01:51:21.214 --> 01:51:26.323
But I have words that
will be howled out...
...where hearing should not catch them.

01:51:26.531 --> 01:51:31.223
- What concern they?
- The main part pertains to you.

01:51:32.058 --> 01:51:36.854
If it be mine, keep it not from me.
Quickly, let me have it.

01:51:37.062 --> 01:51:41.025
Your castle is surprised,
your wife and babes slaughtered.

01:51:41.233 --> 01:51:43.631
Merciful heaven.

01:51:52.181 --> 01:51:54.579
What, man!

01:51:55.726 --> 01:51:59.271
Ne'er put your hat upon your brows.

01:52:03.025 --> 01:52:05.631
Give sorrow words.

01:52:09.177 --> 01:52:10.845
My children too?

01:52:11.053 --> 01:52:16.162
Wife, children, servants.
All that could be found.

01:52:18.143 --> 01:52:22.001
- And I must be from thence. My wife?
- I have said.

01:52:22.210 --> 01:52:26.172
Be comforted. Let's make us
medicines of our great revenge...

01:52:26.276 --> 01:52:29.091
...to cure this deadly grief.

01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:32.219
He has no children.

01:52:34.096 --> 01:52:37.641
All my pretty ones!

01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:40.039
Did you say all?

01:52:40.248 --> 01:52:45.878
Hell-kite! What, all my chickens
and their dam at one fell swoop?

01:52:46.087 --> 01:52:48.589
Dispute it like a man.

01:52:48.798 --> 01:52:53.281
I shall do so, but I must
also feel it as a man.

01:52:54.115 --> 01:52:58.703
I cannot but remember
such things were...

01:52:58.912 --> 01:53:02.457
...that were most precious to me.

01:53:02.665 --> 01:53:06.940
Did the heaven look on
and would not take their part?

01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:09.860
Sinful Macduff,
they were struck for thee.

01:53:10.068 --> 01:53:15.490
Not for their own demerits, but for
mine, fell slaughter on their souls.

01:53:16.116 --> 01:53:18.618
Heaven rest them now.

01:53:18.827 --> 01:53:24.978
Be this the whetstone of your sword.
Let grief convert to anger.

01:53:25.187 --> 01:53:29.462
Blunt not the heart, enrage it!

01:53:44.789 --> 01:53:50.211
Gentle heavens,
cut short all intermission.

01:53:50.419 --> 01:53:54.381
Front to front bring thou
this fiend of Scotland and myself.

01:53:54.694 --> 01:53:58.031
Our power is ready.
Macbeth is ripe for shaking.

01:53:58.135 --> 01:54:01.055
Within my sword's length set him.

01:54:01.263 --> 01:54:05.017
If he escape, heaven forgive him too.

01:54:18.467 --> 01:54:22.951
- What does the tyrant?
- Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.

01:54:23.159 --> 01:54:28.477
Some say he's mad. Others, that
lesser hate him, call it valiant fury.

01:54:28.789 --> 01:54:32.335
Those he commands move in command.
Nothing in love.

01:54:32.543 --> 01:54:35.045
He feels his title
hang loose about him...

01:54:35.254 --> 01:54:37.652
...like a giant's robe
upon a dwarfish thief.

01:54:37.861 --> 01:54:40.884
All that is within him
does condemn itself.

01:54:40.884 --> 01:54:44.951
The English power is near,
led by Malcolm, Seyward and Macduff.

01:54:45.159 --> 01:54:51.103
Near Birnam Wood shall we meet them.
That way are they coming.

01:54:52.249 --> 01:54:56.837
The devil damn thee black, thou loon!
Where gotst thou that goose look?

01:54:57.046 --> 01:54:59.444
There is 10,000...

01:54:59.652 --> 01:55:02.885
- Geese? Villain?
- Soldiers, sir.

01:55:03.719 --> 01:55:08.515
Thou lily-livered boy.
What soldiers, patch?

01:55:08.724 --> 01:55:12.373
Those linen cheeks of thine
are counsellors to fear.

01:55:12.581 --> 01:55:15.709
What soldiers, whey-face?

01:55:15.918 --> 01:55:20.193
The English force, so please you.

01:55:25.719 --> 01:55:30.307
Seyton! Take thy face hence.

01:55:32.705 --> 01:55:37.814
I am sick at heart, when I behold...
Seyton, I say!

01:55:45.947 --> 01:55:48.970
I have lived long enough.

01:55:49.179 --> 01:55:53.245
My way of life is fallen
into the sear, the yellow leaf.

01:55:53.454 --> 01:55:59.293
And that which should accompany
old age, as honour, love...

01:55:59.501 --> 01:56:04.193
... obedience, troops of friends...

01:56:05.236 --> 01:56:08.156
... I must not look to have.

01:56:09.302 --> 01:56:13.369
But in their stead, curses...

01:56:13.890 --> 01:56:18.374
... not loud, but deep.

01:56:18.582 --> 01:56:21.293
Mouth-honour...

01:56:21.502 --> 01:56:26.611
... breath which the poor heart
would fain deny and dare not.

01:56:27.862 --> 01:56:31.720
- Seyton!
- What's your gracious pleasure?

01:56:31.824 --> 01:56:36.516
- What news more?
- All is confirmed which was reported.

01:56:36.725 --> 01:56:41.208
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh
be hacked! Give me my armour!

01:56:41.417 --> 01:56:45.692
- 'Tis not needed yet.
- I'll put it on.

01:56:49.237 --> 01:56:52.156
Send out more horses,
scour the country.

01:56:52.365 --> 01:56:55.180
Hang those that talk of fear.

01:56:55.388 --> 01:56:59.038
Come, put mine armour on,
give me my sword.

01:56:59.246 --> 01:57:05.189
Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, despatch.

01:57:06.336 --> 01:57:10.924
If thou couldst, doctor,
cast the water of my land...

01:57:11.133 --> 01:57:15.825
...find her disease and purge it
to a sound and pristine health.

01:57:16.554 --> 01:57:20.725
I would applaud thee to the very echo
that should applaud again.

01:57:20.934 --> 01:57:22.915
Pull it off, I say.

01:57:23.957 --> 01:57:28.232
What rhubarb, senna
or what purgative drug...

01:57:28.441 --> 01:57:32.403
...would scour these English hence?
Hearst thou of them?

01:57:32.611 --> 01:57:39.389
Ay, my good lord. Your royal
preparation makes us hear something.

01:57:42.204 --> 01:57:45.123
I will not be afraid
of death or bane...

01:57:45.123 --> 01:57:49.086
...till Birnam Forest come
to Dunsinane.

01:57:55.654 --> 01:57:58.470
Were I from Dunsinane
away and clear...

01:57:58.574 --> 01:58:02.327
...profit again should
hardly draw me here.

01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:47.683
- What wood is this before us?
- The wood of Birnam.

01:59:20.944 --> 01:59:25.636
"They met me in the day of success.

01:59:26.575 --> 01:59:30.016
And I have learned by
the perfect'st report...

01:59:30.224 --> 01:59:33.561
...they have more in them
than mortal knowledge.

01:59:33.769 --> 01:59:38.774
While I stood rapt
in the wonder of it, came...

01:59:38.983 --> 01:59:45.343
...missives from the king,
who all-hailed me, Thane of Cawdor...

01:59:45.551 --> 01:59:51.078
...by which title, before,
these weird sisters saluted me...

01:59:51.286 --> 01:59:56.082
...and referred me to
the coming on of time with:

01:59:57.334 --> 02:00:00.983
'Hail, king that shall be! '

02:00:02.025 --> 02:00:06.822
This have I thought good to
deliver thee, my dearest partner...

02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:10.888
...that thou mightst not be...

02:00:11.097 --> 02:00:17.561
...ignorant of what greatness
is promised thee.

02:00:19.021 --> 02:00:25.485
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell."

02:00:30.386 --> 02:00:33.410
Hang out our banners
on the outward walls.

02:00:33.618 --> 02:00:36.955
The cry is still, "They come!"

02:00:39.561 --> 02:00:43.524
Our castle's strength
will laugh a siege to scorn.

02:00:43.732 --> 02:00:48.424
Here let them lie till famine
and the ague eat them up.

02:00:53.429 --> 02:00:57.078
Were they not stuffed with
those that should be ours...

02:00:57.183 --> 02:01:01.353
...we might have met them dareful,
and beat them backward.

02:01:02.813 --> 02:01:05.524
What is that noise?

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:17.097
I've almost forgot the taste of fear.

02:01:25.752 --> 02:01:31.173
The time has been, my senses would
have cooled to hear a night-shriek.

02:01:33.989 --> 02:01:36.178
My fell of hair...

02:01:36.387 --> 02:01:42.226
...would at a dismal treatise
rouse and stir as life were in it.

02:01:45.249 --> 02:01:47.960
I have supped full with horrors.

02:01:52.548 --> 02:01:55.572
Wherefore was that cry?

02:01:56.093 --> 02:01:59.638
The queen, my lord, is dead.

02:02:05.269 --> 02:02:08.709
She should have died hereafter.

02:02:09.022 --> 02:02:12.880
There would have been
a time for such a word.

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:20.283
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...

02:02:20.492 --> 02:02:23.828
... creeps in this petty pace
from day to day...

02:02:23.932 --> 02:02:27.582
... to the last syllable
of recorded time.

02:02:27.894 --> 02:02:34.255
And all our yesterdays have lighted
fools the way to dusty death.

02:02:47.392 --> 02:02:50.520
Out, out, brief candle.

02:02:55.317 --> 02:02:58.757
Life's but a walking shadow.

02:02:58.966 --> 02:03:03.241
A poor player struts and frets
his hour upon the stage...

02:03:03.449 --> 02:03:06.473
...and then is heard no more.

02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:11.999
It is a tale told by an idiot...

02:03:12.208 --> 02:03:17.630
...full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.

02:03:17.838 --> 02:03:19.611
Gracious, my lord!

02:03:19.611 --> 02:03:24.615
Thy story, quickly!
I should report that which I saw,
but know not how.

02:03:24.824 --> 02:03:26.805
Well? Say, sir.

02:03:27.014 --> 02:03:29.620
As I did stand my watch,
I looked toward Birnam.

02:03:29.829 --> 02:03:32.957
And anon, methought,
the wood began to move.

02:03:33.165 --> 02:03:35.563
Liar and slave!

02:03:35.772 --> 02:03:39.943
Within a mile may you see it coming.
A moving grove.

02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:05.175
If thou speakst false, upon the next
tree shalt thou hang alive...

02:04:05.384 --> 02:04:08.199
...till famine cling thee.

02:04:29.678 --> 02:04:35.204
Fear not till Birnam Wood
do come to Dunsinane.

02:04:35.413 --> 02:04:40.522
And now a wood comes
towards Dunsinane.

02:04:44.484 --> 02:04:48.029
Every soldier hath downed a bough
and bears it before him.

02:04:48.237 --> 02:04:51.052
Thereby they shadow the number
of their host...

02:04:51.261 --> 02:04:55.536
...and make discovery err
in report of them.

02:05:05.441 --> 02:05:09.403
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun.

02:05:10.133 --> 02:05:15.972
And wish the estate of the world
were now undone.

02:05:20.351 --> 02:05:23.167
Ring the alarum bell!

02:05:23.584 --> 02:05:28.797
Blow, wind! Come, wrack! At least
we'll die with harness on our back.

02:07:33.813 --> 02:07:36.836
Make all our trumpets speak.

02:08:13.642 --> 02:08:19.273
Worthy Macduff, you, with young
Seyward, lead our first assault.

02:09:00.667 --> 02:09:04.629
Tyrant, show thy face!

02:09:12.762 --> 02:09:16.724
Let me find him, Fortune.
And more I beg not.

02:09:25.169 --> 02:09:28.297
If thou be slain and
with no sword of mine...

02:09:28.506 --> 02:09:32.572
...my wife and children's ghosts
will haunt me still.

02:09:39.871 --> 02:09:45.189
- What is thy name?
- Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

02:09:45.397 --> 02:09:52.070
No, though thou callst thyself
a hotter name than any in hell!
My name's Macbeth!

02:09:52.487 --> 02:09:55.928
The devil could not pronounce
a title more hateful.

02:09:56.032 --> 02:10:00.203
- No, nor more fearful.
- Thou liest, abhorred tyrant!

02:10:00.411 --> 02:10:03.957
With my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speakst.

02:10:49.208 --> 02:10:51.919
Thou werest born of woman.

02:11:37.379 --> 02:11:40.403
They have tied me to the stake.

02:11:41.133 --> 02:11:46.972
I cannot fly. But bearlike
I must fight the course!

02:11:48.015 --> 02:11:52.081
Why should I play the Roman fool
and die on mine own sword...

02:11:52.290 --> 02:11:57.190
...while I see lives
that gashes do better on them?

02:11:57.503 --> 02:12:00.318
What's he that was not born of woman?

02:12:00.839 --> 02:12:04.384
Such a one am I to fear, or none.

02:12:04.593 --> 02:12:08.972
Turn, hell-hound! Turn!

02:12:13.143 --> 02:12:16.584
Of all men else, I have avoided thee.

02:12:16.792 --> 02:12:19.503
I have no words.

02:12:21.901 --> 02:12:25.238
My voice is in my sword.

02:12:28.574 --> 02:12:33.371
Thou bloodier villain
than terms can give thee out!

02:12:58.082 --> 02:12:59.959
My soul...

02:13:00.167 --> 02:13:04.338
...is too much charged
with blood of thine already.

02:13:06.944 --> 02:13:11.428
Let fall thy blade
on vulnerable crests.

02:13:13.096 --> 02:13:15.599
I bear a charmed life...

02:13:15.911 --> 02:13:19.665
...which must not yield
to one of woman born!

02:13:21.333 --> 02:13:26.234
Despair thy charm and let the angel
whom thou hast served tell thee...

02:13:26.442 --> 02:13:31.134
...Macduff was from his mother's womb
untimely ripped.

02:13:34.784 --> 02:13:37.807
Accursed be that tongue
that tells me so...

02:13:37.807 --> 02:13:41.248
... for it hath cowed
my better part of man.

02:13:41.457 --> 02:13:46.357
And be these juggling fiends no more
believed that palter with us.

02:13:46.566 --> 02:13:51.883
That keep the word of promise
to our ear and break it to our hope.

02:13:52.926 --> 02:13:55.220
I will not yield...

02:13:55.533 --> 02:13:59.182
...to kiss the ground
before young Malcolm's feet...

02:13:59.390 --> 02:14:03.040
...and to be baited
with the rabble's curse!

02:14:06.168 --> 02:14:10.130
Though Birnam Wood be come
to Dunsinane...

02:14:10.338 --> 02:14:14.718
...and thou opposed being
of no woman born...

02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:18.054
...yet I will try the last.

02:14:19.410 --> 02:14:22.121
Lay on, Macduff.

02:14:22.329 --> 02:14:27.542
And damned be him that first cries,
"Hold, enough!"

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:55.809
So great a day as this
is cheaply bought.

02:16:56.018 --> 02:16:59.666
Hail, king, for so thou art.

02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:03.838
Behold where lies
the usurper's cursed head.

02:17:05.402 --> 02:17:07.904
The time is free.

02:17:19.999 --> 02:17:22.815
Hail, King of Scotland!

02:17:23.022 --> 02:17:26.777
Hail, King of Scotland!
