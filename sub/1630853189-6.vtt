Tell me, dear lady,

how did you figure it out?

37:06.960 --> 37:08.360
The kidnappers never saw
that money.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.240
You just placed it
for my benefit.

37:11.240 --> 37:14.240
And then you hid it
back here in the bar...

37:14.240 --> 37:17.360
when you went
for your medical kit, I assume.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.800
The fee was 25K.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.200
The bag you showed me...

37:22.200 --> 37:24.920
Oh, clever girl.

37:24.920 --> 37:30.560
My brother transferred 250K,
the rich, fat fool.

37:30.560 --> 37:33.200
He knew my business was in
trouble, but would he help?

37:33.200 --> 37:34.960
No.

37:34.960 --> 37:38.080
Then that little gold-digging
shit Max came along.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.760
So your problem
became your solution.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.440
Fake the kidnap.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.360
The agency fee was 25K,

37:44.360 --> 37:47.680
so you just added a zero
to the ransom note

37:47.680 --> 37:51.200
and presumably appealed to your
brother's love of his niece.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.760
Did you always intend
to kill Max?

37:53.760 --> 37:55.680
Of course.

37:55.680 --> 37:59.480
He was dead the second
he laid eyes on my baby,

37:59.480 --> 38:03.920

two birds with one stone.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.480
I would say the kidnappers
took the money,

to take all of the money?

38:29.680 --> 38:32.680
When you freed him, dear Harry.

38:32.680 --> 38:37.200
My plan was to put the 25K in
the cistern and drive him off,

38:37.200 --> 38:39.000

out of that boot,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.440

to pay a penny.
