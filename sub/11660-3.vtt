00:41.166 --> 00:44.800
(serene music playing)

00:54.567 --> 00:55.834
-Check.
-Check.

00:55.900 --> 00:58.166
-I'll open for a quarter.
-I'm in.

00:58.233 --> 01:01.900
I'll see you a quarter
and I'll raise you a quarter.

01:01.967 --> 01:04.367
By the way, Rose,
your shoe is untied.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.734
I'm too smart for you, Sophia.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.533
You won't distract me this time.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.800
Besides, I'm wearing pumps.

01:11.867 --> 01:13.767
Your pump is untied.

01:14.266 --> 01:15.400
Oh, thanks.

01:19.767 --> 01:23.433
Look! Mr. Feinbaum's totally naked
in his bedroom window.

01:26.033 --> 01:29.166
That's the third time
we caught you cheating.

01:29.233 --> 01:32.266
Hey, when you're 80,
you're allowed to cheat

01:32.333 --> 01:34.467
and take money out of your
daughter's purse.

01:36.433 --> 01:38.734
Oops.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.600
Was that the phone?
I'll get it.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.000
How did you know
your mother was cheating?

01:47.066 --> 01:50.533
Because Mr. Feinbaum
never walks around totally naked.

01:53.533 --> 01:56.133
He always wears a boy scout
neckerchief...

01:58.033 --> 02:01.500
but never in the same place twice,

02:01.567 --> 02:04.300
which is why
there's no Mrs. Feinbaum. Deal.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.667
Oh!

02:07.734 --> 02:09.800
Did you see that, Dorothy?

02:09.867 --> 02:11.433
That was a UFO.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.934
Rose, don't be ridiculous.
It was a plane. Deal.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.567
Planes don't fly over residential
neighborhoods.

02:17.633 --> 02:19.533
Neither do UFOs.

02:19.600 --> 02:23.300
They only fly over
empty fields in Kentucky

02:23.367 --> 02:25.767
where fat guys in overalls
named Cooley

02:25.834 --> 02:28.500
have just run out of gas.

02:28.567 --> 02:30.633
We ought to call the authorities.

02:30.700 --> 02:34.000
Rose,
there's no such thing as a UFO.

02:34.066 --> 02:37.133
They're probably looking for someone
to bring up to the ship.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.867
Then you stay here.

02:38.934 --> 02:41.433
Flag them down
if they fly by again.

02:42.533 --> 02:44.467
I'll go pack a bag.

02:44.533 --> 02:46.600
But I want to go.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.633
Whose bag do you think
I'm going to pack?

02:54.834 --> 02:56.033
Ha, ha, ha.

02:58.867 --> 03:01.500
Ha, ha, ha.

03:01.567 --> 03:03.467
(humming)

03:03.533 --> 03:06.567
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

03:06.633 --> 03:07.867
Ooh.

03:11.367 --> 03:13.133
Mmm.

03:14.767 --> 03:17.667
Blanche, are you
in a good mood?

03:17.734 --> 03:21.767
Dorothy, you always could
see right through me.

03:21.834 --> 03:25.633
Keep it up with those cookies and
superman couldn't see through you.

03:28.633 --> 03:31.133
I got off the phone
with Ham Lushbough,

03:31.200 --> 03:33.500
who's the most charming,
most intelligent,

03:33.567 --> 03:37.200
most sexy man
on the face of this planet.

03:37.266 --> 03:39.700
We went to college together.
Look. There's his picture.

03:39.767 --> 03:43.033
Wow. He sure is handsome.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.667
What did he say?

03:44.734 --> 03:48.300
He's in town on business,
he's single again,

03:48.367 --> 03:52.867
and he wants to take me
to the museum ball Saturday.

03:52.934 --> 03:53.867
The museum ball?

03:53.934 --> 03:56.567
Didn't Roger Clark postpone
his kidney transplant

03:56.633 --> 03:58.000
to be your date?

04:01.467 --> 04:02.767
What's your point?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.500
Sorry to interrupt. Go on.

04:07.567 --> 04:09.100
You have no idea

04:09.166 --> 04:12.467
how my sister Virginia and I
chased after this boy.

04:12.533 --> 04:14.000
Everybody did.

04:14.066 --> 04:16.300
He had it all, football star,

04:16.367 --> 04:18.533
champion debater,
class valedictorian.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.533
How long did you two date?

04:20.600 --> 04:21.834
We didn't.

04:21.900 --> 04:24.934
Not because I didn't try.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.767
I can still remember
the night of the big rally

04:27.834 --> 04:29.233
before the homecoming game.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.066
Oh, there stood Ham,
handsome as ever.

04:32.133 --> 04:35.166
I walked over to him
and asked him the one question

04:35.233 --> 04:39.166
that was burning on my tongue,

04:39.233 --> 04:43.200
"Ham, think you might like
a little company tonight?"

04:43.266 --> 04:44.967
Know what he said?

04:45.033 --> 04:47.367
"Maybe some other time, Blanche."

04:47.433 --> 04:50.367
Can you believe that?
"Maybe some other time."

04:50.433 --> 04:52.934
Blanche,
that doesn't seem so mean.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.700
He had the band
spell it out on the field.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.166
And, Dorothy, to this day,

05:00.233 --> 05:03.266
Ham Lushbough remains
the one man in my life

05:03.333 --> 05:06.467
I could not conquer.

05:06.533 --> 05:08.033
But come Saturday night,

05:08.100 --> 05:12.567
I have a feeling my record's going
to be intact again.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.834
I wouldn't be so sure
if I were Blanche.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.367
Sometimes these things
aren't meant to be,

05:19.433 --> 05:23.333
like me and Fabrizio Rabino.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.934
We were on the verge
of a passionate love affair

05:26.000 --> 05:27.266
when destiny intervened.

05:27.333 --> 05:30.233
Don't tell me.
His wife, Destiny Rabino?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.800
Did she have a temper.

05:33.867 --> 05:37.533
She dragged him away
by the hair on his back,

05:37.600 --> 05:41.433
smashed his skull
with a ravioli crank,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.667
and threw his limp body
in the river.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.033
That's a Sicily
you don't see on postcards.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.166
Rose, what are you doing?

06:10.233 --> 06:13.967
I'm trying to lure that UFO back
with a flashlight and a pie pan.

06:14.033 --> 06:16.700
I read an article once,
in <i>The St. Olaf Times</i>

06:16.767 --> 06:19.500
and it says this
is the best way to do it.

06:19.567 --> 06:21.066
What's the St. Olaf Time?

06:21.133 --> 06:23.900
Well, it's 7:15 here
so subtract an hour.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.300
Forget it.

06:26.367 --> 06:29.066
Now, look, all this nonsense
has to stop, Rose.

06:29.133 --> 06:31.500
What we saw was not a UFO.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.166
Well, it wasn't a plane.

06:34.233 --> 06:36.967
Planes aren't that thin
or that bright.

06:37.033 --> 06:38.333
Neither is Ophra Winfrey

06:38.400 --> 06:40.500
but that doesn't make her
a flying saucer.

06:44.967 --> 06:48.467
The point is,
nobody knows what we saw.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.600
You don't.

06:49.667 --> 06:52.200
I don't.
Not even major Barker does.

06:52.266 --> 06:53.233
Major Barker?

06:53.300 --> 06:56.300
Yeah, that's the man I spoke
to today down at the military base.

06:56.367 --> 06:59.667
I told him what we saw
and he said they'd check into it.

06:59.734 --> 07:01.900
Rose, how could you do that?

07:01.967 --> 07:03.400
Don't you know
what is going to happen?

07:03.467 --> 07:05.533
This is gonna end up
in all the tabloids.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.500
I can see it now, right next to,

07:07.567 --> 07:10.500
"woman gives birth
to doc Severinsen lookalike".

07:12.800 --> 07:15.834
Dorothy Zbornak meets spacemen.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.300
Why do you get all the credit?

07:18.367 --> 07:20.233
(Blanche) Girls.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.000
Girls, look.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.667
How do I look?

07:23.734 --> 07:26.734
-Great, Blanche.
-Great or gorgeous?

07:26.800 --> 07:27.767
Gorgeous.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.333
Well, what about sexy?

07:29.400 --> 07:31.133
-Yes.
-Enticing?

07:31.200 --> 07:32.467
I'll handle this.

07:32.533 --> 07:36.967
Blanche, no woman ever looked
better than you look right now

07:37.033 --> 07:38.767
and no one ever will.

07:43.967 --> 07:45.600
Thank you, Dorothy.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.934
Honestly, Rose,
sometimes it's like pulling teeth

07:48.033 --> 07:50.600
to get a little compliment
out of you.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.567
(doorbell rings)

07:52.633 --> 07:55.200
There's the bell.
That must be Ham at the door.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.834
Come on, come on.

07:59.467 --> 08:00.934
(doorbell rings)

08:01.000 --> 08:02.934
Sophia, wait.
Wait a minute.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.867
Will you calm down?

08:04.934 --> 08:07.600
You're so worked up
over one date.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.834
I let him slip through
my fingers once before.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.633
It won't happen again.

08:26.266 --> 08:27.834
He couldn't slip through
your fingers now

08:27.900 --> 08:29.600
if you used a shoehorn.

08:32.834 --> 08:34.166
Oh, my God.

08:34.233 --> 08:36.400
-Blanche?
-Ham?

08:36.467 --> 08:38.800
Ham Lushbough,
just look at you.

08:38.867 --> 08:39.834
What else can we look at?

08:39.900 --> 08:42.300
He's covering half
the pictures on our wall.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.934
I don't blame you for looking
surprised, Blanche.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.433
There's a little more of me.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.767
Well, maybe a little here,
a little there.

08:52.834 --> 08:57.533
Ham, I'm Dorothy.
This is my mother Sophia.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.200
-That's Rose.
-Hello.

08:59.266 --> 09:00.700
How do you do?

09:00.767 --> 09:05.567
So, what exactly is Ham short for,
Ham?

09:05.633 --> 09:07.934
My guess would be
ham and potatoes.

09:11.433 --> 09:14.100
We'd better be running along.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.433
I'm sure you'll have a wonderful,
wonderful evening.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.266
It was nice meeting you.

09:18.333 --> 09:21.233
I hope we can see more of you.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.000
Don't even bother.

09:24.767 --> 09:25.834
Goodbye.

09:35.333 --> 09:38.133
He sure looks different
from his picture.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.166
Sometimes people
can lose their looks.

09:41.233 --> 09:45.734
Not in Sicily. If you're born
beautiful, you stay beautiful.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.600
The whole town sees to it.

09:47.667 --> 09:51.967
They check up on you.
They never let you slip.

09:52.033 --> 09:56.266
That's why we were so happy
when Dorothy was born.

09:56.333 --> 09:59.200
Who needed all those people
bothering us all the time?

10:02.834 --> 10:05.533
-I'm going back outside, Dorothy.
-Fine, Rose.

10:06.033 --> 10:08.633
(doorbell rings)

10:12.867 --> 10:14.000
Is Rose Nylund in?

10:14.066 --> 10:15.400
Yes. Please come in.

10:15.467 --> 10:18.266
You must be
the man Rose spoke to,

10:18.333 --> 10:20.000
-major Barker?
-That's correct.

10:20.066 --> 10:21.300
Please sit down.

10:21.367 --> 10:25.266
Before I get Rose,
let me assure you

10:25.333 --> 10:29.567
she's the only one here
who thinks she saw a UFO.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.767
I understand completely,
Ms. Zbornak.

10:31.834 --> 10:36.033
By the way,
is that Ms. Zbornak or Mrs.?

10:36.100 --> 10:39.667
-I'm hoping it's Ms.
-Well, yes.

10:44.633 --> 10:47.266
Yes. As a matter of fact, it is.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.567
Good.

10:48.633 --> 10:51.100
I've already got that box checked
on this form.

10:53.867 --> 10:56.834
We've done the research
at the base,

10:56.900 --> 11:00.066
so I just have
a few routine questions.

11:00.133 --> 11:01.333
Question number one,

11:01.400 --> 11:04.300
was the object you saw
more triangular or cylindrical?

11:04.367 --> 11:05.834
No. Triangular.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.500
-Was it blue in color?
-Yes.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.433
Did it leave a trail
of yellow exhaust?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.100
Yes, it did.

11:13.166 --> 11:14.300
Very good.

11:14.367 --> 11:17.433
Ms. Zbornak, there's a
perfectly simple explanation

11:17.500 --> 11:20.433
-for what you saw.
-I knew there was.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.233
What you and Rose Nylund
saw was a UFO.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.934
Oh, Ham Lushbough, you always
made me laugh.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.200
Well, I haven't lost all of it.

11:37.266 --> 11:39.333
Don't talk like that.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.033
You haven't lost a thing.

11:41.100 --> 11:45.333
The way you tell stories,
the way you danced,

11:45.400 --> 11:47.700
you'd think it was 30 years ago.

11:47.767 --> 11:49.800
I'd better go.

11:49.867 --> 11:53.467
Oh, baloney.
In 10 minutes, it'll still be late.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.767
Set yourself down right there.

11:55.834 --> 11:57.367
Go on.

11:57.433 --> 11:59.233
That a boy.

12:04.133 --> 12:07.767
-I had a nice time, Blanche.
-I did too.

12:07.834 --> 12:10.200
And I wasn't sure I would.

12:10.266 --> 12:11.867
What?

12:11.934 --> 12:15.500
This may sound funny,
but I kept thinking,

12:15.567 --> 12:17.900
here I am so bald and so heavy,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.433
and what if Blanche
looks as pretty as always?

12:21.500 --> 12:22.600
I don't.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.767
No, you don't.

12:27.567 --> 12:29.300
What?

12:29.367 --> 12:31.166
You look prettier.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.834
-Oh, Ham.
-No, I mean it.

12:33.900 --> 12:37.000
Your face and the figure
and that smile.

12:37.066 --> 12:41.000
It's all gotten better,
unless it's my age playing tricks.

12:41.066 --> 12:42.033
No.

12:45.967 --> 12:48.033
I'm glad I looked you up, Blanche.

12:48.100 --> 12:52.066
I haven't had this much fun
in a long time.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.433
I'd better be getting
back to the hotel.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.166
Are you sure you have to?

12:57.233 --> 13:00.500
Are you asking me
what I think you're asking?

13:02.400 --> 13:04.900
Think you might like
some company tonight?

13:06.133 --> 13:08.000
Maybe some other time, Blanche.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.133
What are you doing?

13:25.200 --> 13:28.300
Oh. Looking at the stars...

13:29.600 --> 13:32.300
pondering the universe.

13:32.367 --> 13:34.600
I've been doing
the same thing,

13:34.667 --> 13:39.266
thinking how wonderful it would be
if there really were aliens.

13:39.333 --> 13:43.433
Maybe it would be like <i>Cocoon,</i>
and they'd take us away,

13:43.500 --> 13:46.033
and we'd never grow old.

13:46.100 --> 13:49.333
I don't know. I like my life.

13:49.400 --> 13:53.600
I'm not president or anything.
I'm just a teacher.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.433
A substitute teacher.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.467
A divorced substitute teacher

13:59.533 --> 14:01.633
who can't afford
her own place to live.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.367
Beam me up!

14:05.033 --> 14:06.000
Beam me up?

14:06.066 --> 14:07.567
Dorothy, you believe?

14:07.633 --> 14:13.567
Rose, they checked out what we saw,
and it actually was a UFO.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.867
Come back.
We'll miss the aliens.

14:20.934 --> 14:23.500
That's fine with me.

14:23.567 --> 14:26.934
Dorothy,
why are you talking that way?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.467
I think it's wonderful

14:28.533 --> 14:32.200
there are other beings
out there trying to meet us.

14:32.266 --> 14:35.467
They might have solutions
to all our problems,

14:35.533 --> 14:37.700
cures for our diseases,

14:37.767 --> 14:40.133
new storylines for <i>Alf.</i>

14:42.367 --> 14:45.100
They might also have
tentacles on their legs

14:45.166 --> 14:47.734
so they can suck our blood.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.633
No. I'm sorry, Rose. I'm sorry.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.667
Part of me is very excited,
but part is petrified.

14:53.734 --> 14:55.633
I cannot relax.

14:55.700 --> 14:57.467
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to

14:57.533 --> 15:00.367
because major Barker
does not want us

15:00.433 --> 15:04.600
to say a word
about this to anyone

15:04.667 --> 15:06.734
until we hear from him again.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.667
Not a word.

15:08.734 --> 15:10.033
Is that understood?

15:10.533 --> 15:11.934
Yes.

15:12.433 --> 15:15.200
I thought I heard voices.
What you girls doing?

15:15.266 --> 15:17.166
Oh, nothing.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.200
We're just sitting talking.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.633
Not talking about anything special.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.066
The subject of aliens
never came up.

15:29.767 --> 15:33.233
I can give you something
to talk about, my date tonight,

15:33.300 --> 15:38.100
the most humiliating evening
I've spent in my life.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.834
So, what are we talking about?

15:40.900 --> 15:41.900
Blanche's date.

15:41.967 --> 15:44.633
He turned me down...
again.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.200
I'm just devastated.

15:46.266 --> 15:48.266
Blanche, you've said yourself

15:48.333 --> 15:50.433
you didn't find him
that attractive anymore.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.567
That's not the point.

15:51.633 --> 15:54.967
To Blanche Devereaux,
sexuality and attractiveness

15:55.033 --> 15:56.734
are two very important things.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.000
They are Blanche Devereaux.

15:59.066 --> 16:03.066
It just tortures me to know
that there's one man out there

16:03.133 --> 16:08.000
on the face of God's earth
that I cannot have.

16:08.066 --> 16:10.467
Especially if he's fat and bald.

16:11.900 --> 16:14.033
Blanche, forget about it.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.333
I can't forget about it.

16:16.834 --> 16:19.100
There's only one thing
for me to do.

16:19.166 --> 16:22.900
Tomorrow night,
I'm going out with him again.

16:22.967 --> 16:25.367
I don't care how much seducing
it takes.

16:25.433 --> 16:27.233
As God is my witness,

16:27.300 --> 16:31.433
I'm not coming home
until he has begged, beseeched,

16:31.500 --> 16:34.834
and pleaded with me
to go to bed with him.

16:37.700 --> 16:40.934
That was the original ending
to <i>Gone With the Wind.</i>

16:45.400 --> 16:47.266
(mellow music playing)

16:55.100 --> 16:57.500
That was a terrific meal, Blanche.
Thanks again.

16:57.567 --> 17:00.967
I figured you deserved it
before going back

17:01.033 --> 17:05.533
to that dog-eat-dog pressure
pit you work in.

17:05.600 --> 17:09.200
Blanche,
I run a miniature golf course.

17:09.266 --> 17:10.467
Your champagne,
miss Devereaux?

17:10.533 --> 17:11.934
Thank you.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.300
You will forgive me if the champagne
has an effect on me.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.700
Sometimes just having it
setting on the table

17:18.767 --> 17:21.033
sets my heart racing.

17:21.100 --> 17:22.200
Oh!

17:22.266 --> 17:23.667
Feel.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.700
Lower.

17:28.633 --> 17:34.767
It's like some kind of wild animal
energy in there pounding...

17:35.867 --> 17:40.133
pounding and burning
and yearning and lusting,

17:40.200 --> 17:41.867
crying out to be released.

17:41.934 --> 17:44.066
(cork pops)

17:44.133 --> 17:46.500
I've never said this
to another man, Ham,

17:46.567 --> 17:50.734
but I feel a heat between us,
a flame crackling and hissing.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.700
I want you to put
that flame out, Ham.

17:55.200 --> 18:00.367
I want you to pluck me like a fruit
and wash me off in your kisses

18:00.433 --> 18:04.333
and sink your teeth
into my juicy flesh.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.233
Let me make you happy.

18:15.300 --> 18:19.166
Say you want me
as much as I want you.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.533
Maybe some other time, Blanche.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.200
That does it.

18:26.266 --> 18:29.367
I won't let you humiliate me
any longer.

18:29.433 --> 18:31.533
You may not want me,

18:31.600 --> 18:36.166
but somewhere on this planet,
I'll find some man who does!

18:50.300 --> 18:53.400
(mellow music playing)

18:56.734 --> 18:58.567
-Hi, girls.
-How did it go, Blanche?

18:58.633 --> 19:02.467
Oh, perfectly. When Blanche
Devereaux seduces a man,

19:02.533 --> 19:03.900
she doesn't drag her feet.

19:03.967 --> 19:05.967
(doorbell rings)

19:09.467 --> 19:10.400
Blanche.

19:10.467 --> 19:13.800
Well, Ham Lushbough,
you sex-hungry devil.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.266
I told you, no more.

19:17.333 --> 19:18.834
Take a cold shower.

19:18.900 --> 19:23.133
No, not until you know
why I can't sleep with you.

19:24.166 --> 19:24.900
Ma, listen.

19:24.967 --> 19:29.767
Maybe watching TV in another room
might be a good idea.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.800
Fine, Dorothy,
but keep the volume down.

19:36.033 --> 19:37.300
Ma!

19:37.367 --> 19:40.333
It's ok.
It's out in the open.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.467
Come say your piece.

19:42.533 --> 19:47.467
We've been getting along so well.

19:47.533 --> 19:51.767
I didn't want us to have another
night like we had in college.

19:51.834 --> 19:53.734
What are you talking about?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.166
That night.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.700
The spring jamboree
out at Grady's motor lodge.

19:57.767 --> 20:00.333
I never went there with you.

20:00.400 --> 20:05.633
Sure you did. Your hair was braided,
you wore a pink bathrobe.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.033
Pink?

20:07.100 --> 20:08.400
With little lace trim?

20:08.467 --> 20:09.400
Yes.

20:09.467 --> 20:10.500
Matching slippers?

20:10.567 --> 20:13.066
-Yes.
-That wasn't me.

20:13.133 --> 20:14.734
That was my sister Virginia.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.633
You're kidding?
That was Virginia?

20:17.700 --> 20:19.467
How could I forget that?

20:19.533 --> 20:20.467
That was the worst night

20:20.533 --> 20:23.667
I've ever spent
with a woman in my life!

20:24.934 --> 20:27.433
Wait a minute, Ham.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.967
The only reason
you've kept turning me down

20:30.033 --> 20:33.633
-is because of that bad night?
-Yes.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.266
Oh.

20:35.333 --> 20:38.633
Oh, well, Blanche,
this changes everything.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.500
Does all that stuff
you said still go?

20:42.734 --> 20:44.433
I don't think so, Ham.

20:47.600 --> 20:51.266
The moment is passed.
We could never recapture it.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.800
Blanche,
that was just 20 minutes ago.

20:55.166 --> 21:00.100
You were just a plaything
in my game of sexual conquest.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.333
I was going to use you.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.100
Use me. Use me.

21:04.600 --> 21:09.100
Goodbye, Ham. Leave now,
and we'll still have our memories.

21:09.166 --> 21:11.834
I'll trade all my memories
for a quickie.

21:14.567 --> 21:15.867
Beat it, tubbo.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.867
I wonder what would happen
if somebody called my sister

21:25.934 --> 21:29.133
and told her this terribly
embarrassing story.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.900
I guess there's only one way
to find out.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.266
Well, I'm going to bed.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.900
-You coming, Ma?
-In a minute.

21:39.967 --> 21:43.767
I got to finish this article.

21:43.834 --> 21:46.166
First, these military guys fly
this top secret bomber jet

21:46.233 --> 21:47.533
way off course.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.867
Next, they deny it happened,

21:49.934 --> 21:53.700
like nobody ever saw it flying
over downtown Miami.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.800
Rose.

21:59.867 --> 22:00.967
Hi, Dorothy.

22:01.033 --> 22:05.200
Rose, there's something
we have to talk about.

22:05.266 --> 22:07.600
There was an article
in today's paper.

22:07.667 --> 22:10.200
About the UFO being a bomber?

22:10.266 --> 22:11.567
I'm sorry, Rose.

22:11.633 --> 22:13.667
Sorry for what?

22:13.734 --> 22:16.533
Just because that one
bomber wasn't a UFO

22:16.600 --> 22:19.333
doesn't mean we should
stop watching for others.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.300
Does it?

22:25.467 --> 22:26.767
Oh.

22:28.734 --> 22:32.467
Well, there isn't much point in
sitting out here anymore, is there?

22:32.533 --> 22:34.367
Oh, I don't know, Rose.

22:34.433 --> 22:35.834
It's such a nice night.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.767
Let's stay a while.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.000
Okay.

22:44.066 --> 22:48.633
Dorothy, you don't have to tell
me this if you don't want to.

22:49.667 --> 22:54.667
But... underneath it all,
you believe in them, don't you?

22:54.734 --> 22:58.100
You did from the very beginning.

22:58.166 --> 22:59.567
Oh, I'm glad.

23:01.300 --> 23:02.600
It's more fun.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.667
It's like with Santa Claus.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.800
The best Christmas we ever had

23:06.867 --> 23:09.433
was when all eight
of my brothers and sisters,

23:09.500 --> 23:13.166
from Lily to Michael,
all still believed.

23:14.667 --> 23:17.100
That must be 10 years ago now.

23:22.633 --> 23:24.066
Dorothy!

23:25.533 --> 23:27.066
Dorothy.

23:44.066 --> 23:47.400
(theme music playing)
