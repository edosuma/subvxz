WEBVTT

00:06.549 --> 00:08.801
Previously on
Star Trek: Picard...

00:08.884 --> 00:10.636
I want you to reinstate me.

00:10.720 --> 00:14.432
I will need a small reconnaissance ship
with a minimal crew.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.684
You think you could just waltz
back in here and be entrusted

00:16.767 --> 00:18.894
with taking men and women into space?

00:18.978 --> 00:21.272
I have reason to believe
that the Tal Shiar

00:21.355 --> 00:24.400
is merely a mask
worn by another, far older cabal.

00:24.483 --> 00:25.609
The Zhat Vash.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.236
Admiral Clancy just called.

00:27.319 --> 00:31.741
Jean-Luc Picard was trying to persuade her
to let him go after Doctor Bruce Maddox.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.909
I want you to stay on mission.

00:33.993 --> 00:35.202
I've put my best man on it.

00:35.995 --> 00:36.996
Nice of you to knock.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.248
Commodore Oh is quite distressed.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.791
I'm still confident that my approach,

00:40.875 --> 00:43.085
which you approved,
is the only sound approach.

00:43.169 --> 00:45.671
Are we allowed to be sleeping together
or is that a secret?

00:45.755 --> 00:47.214
Very much the latter.

00:47.298 --> 00:50.593
How likely is the Collective
to re-establish a link to your Borg?

00:50.676 --> 00:51.844
Well, they're former Borg.

00:51.927 --> 00:54.430
And we're not releasing them,
we're reclaiming them.

00:54.513 --> 00:55.723
There's really no danger.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.559
-I have to go.
-Go where? Go how?

00:58.642 --> 01:00.728
-You need help, you need protection.
-Yeah.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.522
You need someone who hates you
and has nothing to lose.

01:04.106 --> 01:08.486
Raffi, it's Jean-Luc.
Please don't hang up. I need a ship.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.865
There isn't anything you could say
that I wanna hear.

01:12.948 --> 01:16.452
Secret Romulan assassins
are operating on Earth.

01:17.995 --> 01:18.996
Goddamn it.

02:10.756 --> 02:14.051
They give you a hard time?
They start with the ships?

02:14.885 --> 02:17.555
Straight out. Just as you predicted.

02:17.638 --> 02:21.517
You were ready with the inventories
from Beta Antares and Eridani A.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.768
Which shut them up.

02:22.852 --> 02:24.103
Uh...

02:24.186 --> 02:25.646
So, they hit you with manpower?

02:25.729 --> 02:26.647
Mm.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.984
But you had the reserve rosters
I got from Tanaka in personnel.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.527
Yeah, I laid it all out.

02:31.610 --> 02:35.281
By using reserve duty officers
and mothballed ships,

02:35.364 --> 02:37.533
we could maintain the evacuation,

02:37.616 --> 02:41.036
though to a severely reduced level.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.205
Not if we use synthetic labor.

02:43.289 --> 02:45.916
All synthetic life-forms are banned

02:46.000 --> 02:48.502
throughout the Federation,
effective immediately.

02:48.586 --> 02:53.799
All active units are dismantled.
And all research is halted.

02:53.883 --> 02:57.344
That's crazy. It makes no sense.

02:57.428 --> 03:00.514
Synths don't just wake up
one morning and turn homicidal.

03:00.598 --> 03:04.310
They said it was a fatal code error

03:04.393 --> 03:05.895
in the operating system.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.104
That's bullshit.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.400
Something's off
about this whole business, JL.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.486
It doesn't add up. I smell the Tal Shiar.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.364
The Tal Shiar.

03:17.448 --> 03:21.368
Raffi, why would the Romulans
attack a fleet

03:21.452 --> 03:24.288
built expressly to rescue them?

03:25.080 --> 03:28.083
I can't answer that... yet.

03:28.167 --> 03:31.545
But I do know that there are billions
of people out there in the Beta Quadrant

03:31.629 --> 03:34.423
that are in the burst radius
of a supernova.

03:34.506 --> 03:38.260
It's not their fault that a bunch of A500s
went rogue on Mars.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.346
You're absolutely right.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.683
Mars is burning.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.187
Tens of thousands are dead.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.776
And nobody is thinking. Nobody
is listening. They're just reacting.

03:55.027 --> 03:58.364
Wait a minute. What happened in there, JL?

04:00.699 --> 04:04.119
They said that our plan was unfeasible.

04:04.745 --> 04:08.415
Half of them never wanted
to rescue the Romulans in the first place.

04:08.499 --> 04:09.833
And the rest are...

04:11.335 --> 04:14.046
are just frightened.

04:14.922 --> 04:20.386
I never dreamed that Starfleet
would give in to intolerance and fear.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.263
What happened in there?

04:23.347 --> 04:27.893
I said that either they accept
the revised evacuation plan

04:29.269 --> 04:30.729
or my resignation.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.692
Are you serious?

04:39.822 --> 04:41.156
What did they say?

04:44.326 --> 04:45.536
Jean-Luc.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.830
They accepted my resignation.

04:54.086 --> 04:56.672
Fine. Hell with them.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.216
We'll figure it out. We'll find a way.

04:59.299 --> 05:04.304
To mount a multi-world evacuation
of tens of millions of Romulans

05:04.388 --> 05:07.391
without Starfleet support?

05:07.474 --> 05:08.642
There has to be something.

05:10.185 --> 05:15.190
Some last desperate, wild solution, JL?

05:15.274 --> 05:17.234
I mean, that's what you do.

05:19.111 --> 05:23.615
My resignation was
the last desperate, wild solution.

05:26.702 --> 05:30.748
I never believed
that they would accept it.

05:33.459 --> 05:35.169
Of course, you wouldn't.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.213
Now what?

05:39.006 --> 05:42.551
You're gonna go back
to your château and write your memoirs?

05:44.470 --> 05:47.765
I can't do this without you, JL.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.272
The CNC wants to see me.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.693
That's great. It's great.

06:00.736 --> 06:04.740
You tender your resignation
and my ass gets fired.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.411
Raffi.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.493
A synthetic girl.

08:14.703 --> 08:18.540
There were two of them.
One of them is already dead.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.501
I only hope that I'm in time
to save the other one.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.922
Raffi, I need a ship and a pilot.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.925
And I have to find Bruce Maddox.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.384
Wow.

08:30.928 --> 08:31.929
I don't even know what to say.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.764
Yeah, it's a lot to take in--

08:33.847 --> 08:35.474
I mean, the obvious way to go would be,

08:35.557 --> 08:38.268
"You have some goddamn nerve!"

08:38.352 --> 08:43.023
But I gather you already heard that
from your buddy Clancy. Right?

08:55.077 --> 08:57.788
Pro tip for future reference.

08:57.871 --> 09:02.709
On your next top-secret, unauthorized
synthetic-girl rescue mission,

09:02.793 --> 09:07.756
try not telling the CNC of Starfleet
exactly what you're planning on doing.

09:08.757 --> 09:12.302
I don't remember you being
such a chatterbox back in the day.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.639
I mean,  I saw your interview.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.684
An unmitigated disaster.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.561
Yeah. I saw you...

09:23.105 --> 09:26.817
sitting back in your very fine château.

09:27.567 --> 09:32.489
Those big oak beams. Heirloom furniture.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.535
I'd show you around my estate,
but it's more of a hovel.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.829
So that would just be,
you know, humiliating.

09:40.455 --> 09:44.001
My entire life for the past 14 years

09:44.084 --> 09:48.463
has been one long slide
into humiliation...

09:50.424 --> 09:51.633
and rage.

09:54.553 --> 09:58.557
Also a fair amount
of snakeleaf-induced paranoia

09:58.640 --> 10:01.685
so some things never change.

10:10.986 --> 10:14.364
Might have been nice to hear from you
a time or two in there, JL.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.409
Not because you think I know
an off-the-books pilot

10:17.492 --> 10:19.411
with an unregistered starship.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.247
Just...

10:24.833 --> 10:26.001
say hi.

10:28.337 --> 10:29.671
See how I was doing.

10:29.755 --> 10:33.091
-I know, I--
-Because I was not doing good.

10:34.509 --> 10:38.388
I lost my security clearance. I lost...

10:40.849 --> 10:42.267
-Don't-- No, don't--
-Raffi.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.769
Just don't touch me.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.312
Raffi.

10:54.738 --> 10:55.739
Raffi.

11:35.112 --> 11:38.240
You are free now, my friend.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.254
I really don't know what to say,
Doctor Asha.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.299
Your work here has always been excellent.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.636
But speaking to a Nameless
in his own language...

12:01.221 --> 12:02.305
outstanding.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.436
You taught me that even a few words
in the mother tongue can be soothing.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.146
Even in an unconscious state.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.984
There's no more despised people
in the galaxy than the xBs.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.779
People either see us as property
to be exploited

12:18.405 --> 12:20.198
or as a hazard to be warehoused.

12:21.324 --> 12:25.120
Our host, the Romulans,
have a more expansive vision.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.497
They see us as both.

12:28.457 --> 12:29.875
I hate it.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.751
You're different.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.337
Thank you.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.049
I've decided to let you have
your interview with Ramdha.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.886
Oh, my God. Really?

12:40.969 --> 12:43.305
You've been pestering me about it
for a long time.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.641
After today, I'm inclined
to grant your request.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.311
Tell me... why?

12:51.563 --> 12:54.483
How much do you know about Ramdha
before she was assimilated?

12:54.566 --> 12:56.443
Have you read her Romulan dossier?

12:56.526 --> 12:59.196
Of course not. Wait, have you?

13:02.657 --> 13:04.451
How did you manage that?

13:04.534 --> 13:06.369
I just, sort of, asked to see it.

13:07.037 --> 13:11.458
Usually, I find that if I ask people
for help, they're happy to give it.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.376
That has not been my experience.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.920
In particular with Romulans.

13:15.003 --> 13:18.256
Ramdha was the foremost expert
on ancient Romulan myth.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.633
She wrote books about it.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.093
And this interest of hers
links you to her work how?

13:22.177 --> 13:25.472
There is ample evidence
for the therapeutic utility

13:25.555 --> 13:27.766
of a shared mythical framework.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.645
Thirty minutes.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.815
As an experiment.
Then we'll see how that goes.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.162
It makes total sense that you're angry.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.789
I disappointed you.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.668
I neglected you
and I wasn't there when you needed me.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.671
I'm truly sorry.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.134
I don't care.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.553
Raffi.

14:04.636 --> 14:09.391
There is a unit of Tal Shiar synth hunters

14:09.474 --> 14:12.269
operating on Earth, openly.

14:12.352 --> 14:16.690
That could not happen
without Federation complicity.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.025
I'm listening.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.111
You always said there were

14:21.194 --> 14:23.822
Romulan-Federation connections
I didn't see.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.949
I was talking about Mars, JL.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.493
The Romulan rescue.

14:28.577 --> 14:33.665
Those aren't connections I just "see,"
like people see angels, or ghosts.

14:33.748 --> 14:37.002
I have evidence. I have concrete evidence

14:37.085 --> 14:39.921
that a high-ranking
Starfleet official conspired

14:40.005 --> 14:42.465
to allow the attack to go forward.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.384
To put an end to the rescue mission.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.885
-Raffi--
-Which they opposed!

14:45.969 --> 14:49.514
Raffi, they had no reason
to sabotage their own rescue.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.934
What do you think happens
when there's a cover-up?

14:53.977 --> 14:55.437
They conceal it.

14:57.355 --> 15:01.151
That's why I need your help.
I need your mind.

15:01.234 --> 15:05.572
Your ability to see things
others don't see.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.908
No. No, no, no...

15:08.992 --> 15:11.953
I will not go down
another rabbit hole with you, JL.

15:12.037 --> 15:14.205
-No, never again. No. Go!
-Raffi--

15:19.169 --> 15:20.587
Get out of here, please.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.549
Please.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.436
I have a pilot for you.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.148
His name is Rios.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.109
And he'll be in touch.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.945
Rios. Thank you.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.323
Now go.

16:16.893 --> 16:17.894
Hi?

16:17.977 --> 16:22.232
Doctor Jurati? Commodore Oh.
Director of Starfleet Security.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.484
Okay.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.862
I'd like to talk to you about your two
recent visits with Admiral Picard.

16:43.712 --> 16:47.382
She's here to meet with Patient 4822/2.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.591
She'll need authorization.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.593
This unit is operated
by the Reclamation Project.

16:50.677 --> 16:55.265
It is under the direct authority
of its Executive Director, me.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.600
Open up.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.042
All the disordered are Romulans.

17:23.126 --> 17:26.045
The only Romulans ever assimilated,
as far as I know.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.138
There she is.

17:50.945 --> 17:51.988
Hi.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.177
What?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.970
You're doing the research, aren't you?

18:16.054 --> 18:17.055
No.

18:17.138 --> 18:20.266
I'm sending you everything
that Daystrom had on Bruce Maddox.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.560
-I don't want it.
-Carry on.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.505
Captain Rios?

18:53.383 --> 18:54.884
Oh. Hi. Hello.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.177
Picard.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.512
Yes. Sorry. Of course you are.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.556
I'm afraid you might be too late.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.059
Right then. Come on.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.316
So, what seems to be the problem?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.360
Are you kidding me? Hey.

19:12.777 --> 19:13.778
Are you...

19:13.862 --> 19:15.613
Chris Rios. He's just an EMH.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.365
-"Just..."
-I'm--

19:17.448 --> 19:20.034
I know who you are.
I read one of your books one time.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.203
What happened to you?

19:23.705 --> 19:26.332
I didn't die. Medkit.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.421
Aguardiente.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.346
No, thanks.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.103
What you wanna do is take the giant hunk
of tritanium shrapnel

19:47.186 --> 19:49.272
out of the hole in my shoulder.
That's just a guess.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.482
Please. Sit.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.203
Toss it anywhere.

20:06.039 --> 20:10.960
So,  where are we going, Admiral?
Raffi says you have no idea.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.463
-I'm working on it.
-When are we leaving?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.173
As soon as possible.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.550
You breaking any laws or are intending to?

20:17.634 --> 20:18.968
I don't know.

20:20.219 --> 20:24.098
I'm not in the habit of consulting lawyers

20:24.182 --> 20:28.269
before I do what needs to be done. You?

20:28.353 --> 20:31.105
I'm not in the habit of consulting
anybody about anything.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.025
Especially a lawyer.

20:34.984 --> 20:38.821
There we are.
Now for the dermal regenerator.

20:38.905 --> 20:42.575
Leave it. Give me that. Get lost.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.329
He never gets any nicer.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.789
Duly noted.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.332
Deactivate EMH.

20:51.334 --> 20:55.588
I need a pilot.
Raffi says you're the best around.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.423
I never argue with Raffi.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.509
Wise man.

20:59.592 --> 21:03.888
You were the XO of a heavy cruiser?

21:03.972 --> 21:05.473
The ibn Majid.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.351
You've never heard of it
because it doesn't exist.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.603
Starfleet erased it from the records.

21:10.687 --> 21:14.899
Do I detect a certain bitterness
towards Starfleet?

21:14.983 --> 21:20.238
You must know that Starfleet and I
have long since have parted ways.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.908
If you say so. I really don't give a damn.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.035
Oh, really?

21:26.911 --> 21:30.665
I see this ship is impeccably maintained.

21:30.748 --> 21:34.836
Every bolt and clasp and fitting in place.

21:34.919 --> 21:38.673
Everything stowed
in regulation Starfleet order.

21:38.756 --> 21:43.761
I don't know what happened to you, Rios,
or to the ibn Majid.

21:43.845 --> 21:49.475
But five minutes on this ship
and I know precisely what I'm looking at.

21:49.559 --> 21:53.688
You are Starfleet to the core.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.649
I can smell it on you.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.193
That's just my tragic sense of life.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.863
Raffi warned me you were a speech-maker.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.492
Look, Admiral.
Hire me or find another pilot.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.286
Do not try to get inside my head.

22:56.334 --> 22:59.253
The navigation sensors
are back at maximum range.

22:59.337 --> 23:02.423
Whatever it was,
it scraped off pretty easily.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.175
Mm-hmm.

23:04.258 --> 23:08.513
So, are we excited? Intimidated?

23:08.596 --> 23:11.349
Maybe a teensy bit starstruck?

23:11.432 --> 23:15.895
Jean-Luc Picard.
Chief contact with the Q Continuum.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.773
Arbiter of Succession
for the Klingon Empire.

23:18.856 --> 23:22.235
Savior of Earth from Borg Invasion.

23:22.318 --> 23:27.031
Captain of the Enterprises D and E.

23:27.115 --> 23:30.660
The man even worked
alongside the great Spock.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.204
You are an emergency hologram.

23:33.287 --> 23:35.623
We no longer have
a navigational emergency.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.043
Why are you still here?

23:39.127 --> 23:43.089
Well, someone is experiencing
an acute moodiness overload.

23:48.636 --> 23:51.848
Picard is a good man, Captain Rios.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.475
He's on the side of the angels.

23:54.559 --> 23:57.895
It's been a long time since you helped out
somebody like him.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.898
A very long time.

24:00.982 --> 24:03.985
Please spare me
the juvenile Sunday school morality.

24:04.068 --> 24:07.405
Then spare me
the angsty teenage moral relativism.

24:07.488 --> 24:10.449
I already had
one grand heroic captain in my life.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.577
The last thing I need is another one.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.996
Ten years on,
I still can't close my eyes at night

24:15.079 --> 24:19.917
without seeing the last one's blood
and brains splattered all over a bulkhead.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.504
Deactivate ENH.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.381
Oh, no. You--

25:04.003 --> 25:06.756
The familiar smell of harvest time.

25:08.382 --> 25:10.468
Woodsmoke. Mown hay.

25:10.551 --> 25:15.514
And that heavy sweetness of the grapes.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.476
And you won't miss it?

25:19.352 --> 25:21.604
Any of it, one bit?

25:21.687 --> 25:23.439
Oh, yes, my dear.

25:23.522 --> 25:27.443
I will miss you and Zhaban and Number One.

25:30.488 --> 25:36.077
I tried my best to belong to this place.

25:38.663 --> 25:44.168
But I don't think I ever truly felt
at home here.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.258
I suppose you always had
one eye on the stars.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.949
That looks like a door.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.200
Very close.

26:16.284 --> 26:19.453
I think that one's called shaiqouin,
which means--

26:19.537 --> 26:20.788
A false door.

26:20.871 --> 26:24.792
Traditional Romulan houses always have
a false front door that's never used.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.669
You have to go around the back.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.337
You're kind of a know-it-all, aren't you?

26:43.019 --> 26:46.314
If certain people requested entry...

26:46.814 --> 26:48.899
...would it be granted?

26:59.076 --> 27:00.411
You may sit.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.959
For the road.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.713
Bread. Roquefort.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.091
Madame Arnaud's terrine d'oie.

27:14.175 --> 27:18.262
Far beyond the power of any replicator,
I should think. And lastly the plum--

27:19.138 --> 27:20.973
- They killed the alarm!
-Take him.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.043
All right.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.212
All right.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.810
Maybe... maybe it was on stun.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.564
Romulan disruptors
don't have a stun setting.

28:52.314 --> 28:53.315
Oh, God.

28:56.527 --> 28:57.736
It's all right.

28:58.988 --> 29:03.117
Thank you. It's all right. Come.

29:23.387 --> 29:24.513
Here.

29:27.475 --> 29:28.934
Her name was Oh.

29:29.018 --> 29:31.770
Chief of Starfleet Security. A Vulcan.

29:31.854 --> 29:32.897
You know her?

29:32.980 --> 29:36.984
No. But I hear
that she's very good at her job.

29:37.067 --> 29:40.779
She wanted to know why you came to see me.

29:41.739 --> 29:43.240
And I'm sorry but I told her.

29:44.033 --> 29:48.078
Seemed too important not to.
And anyway, I'm a terrible liar.

29:48.162 --> 29:50.456
Of course. It's all right.

29:52.249 --> 29:55.336
There's one thing
I didn't tell her though.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.339
-Zhaban.
-We've no time, Laris.

29:58.422 --> 29:59.798
They'll send others.

29:59.882 --> 30:01.675
We are not like them anymore.

30:09.475 --> 30:10.476
Admiral.

30:11.227 --> 30:12.269
He's conscious.

30:24.281 --> 30:25.533
Let's talk.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.454
My name is Soji.

30:30.538 --> 30:33.207
I'm working with Hugh
on the Reclamation Project.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.501
But I'm an anthropologist by training.

30:44.051 --> 30:47.680
My presence is an intrusion, forgive it.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.979
Ramdha has good days and bad days.

30:55.896 --> 30:56.939
We all do.

30:59.942 --> 31:03.571
Can you tell me about the cards,
Ramdha? The pixmit.

31:03.654 --> 31:06.115
How do they work?
Do you tell fortunes with them?

31:07.908 --> 31:10.703
It's kind of a mandala. Is that it?

31:15.749 --> 31:18.544
Do the images have a connection
to Romulan mythology?

31:18.627 --> 31:19.962
Mythology?

31:21.046 --> 31:22.548
I hate that word.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.426
In Romulan we have no such word.

31:26.010 --> 31:29.221
What's a better word? Scriptures?

31:29.305 --> 31:31.890
Sacred stories? Legendarium?

31:31.974 --> 31:33.475
The news.

31:36.604 --> 31:39.773
I love that. That's perfect.

31:41.150 --> 31:44.445
The idea that former Borg
might be able to create a mythol--

31:45.487 --> 31:48.699
a shared narrative framework
for understanding their trauma.

31:48.782 --> 31:50.993
Rooted in deep archetypes,

31:51.076 --> 31:53.412
but as relevant as the day's news.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.998
That's just what I'm hoping to do.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.588
I know you.

32:05.633 --> 32:08.761
Why is the Tal Shiar on Earth?

32:08.844 --> 32:10.971
Are you Zhat Vash?

32:11.930 --> 32:16.060
If you answer my questions,
I will release you.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.315
-This is pointless.
- Yes,

32:21.398 --> 32:23.942
because he's
a stubborn Northerner like you.

32:26.487 --> 32:30.282
I remember you from tomorrow.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.786
No, Ramdha. We've never met.

32:37.164 --> 32:40.542
Okay. What was I doing
when you met me tomorrow?

32:47.174 --> 32:50.302
One of the things
that makes you so special, Ramdha,

32:50.386 --> 32:52.805
is that you were on board
the very last ship

32:52.888 --> 32:54.890
ever assimilated by this Cube.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.601
Is that true? How do you know that?

32:57.685 --> 33:02.189
You were on board the Imperial scout ship
Shaenor with 25 other passengers.

33:02.272 --> 33:05.526
You encountered this Cube.
You were assimilated.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.361
But then something went wrong.

33:14.785 --> 33:19.498
What happened, Ramdha? Do you know?
What caused the submatrix collapse?

33:22.626 --> 33:23.877
Why did you kill that girl?

33:24.503 --> 33:26.547
Why did you kill Dahj Asha?

33:26.630 --> 33:28.465
She's not a girl.

33:30.384 --> 33:31.802
Which one are you?

33:32.845 --> 33:36.306
Just help me understand what is happening.

33:36.390 --> 33:38.851
She's not what you think she is.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.478
Which sister are you?

33:43.272 --> 33:47.151
Why did you kill her?
Is there another one like her?

33:47.234 --> 33:48.986
Which sister are you?

33:49.069 --> 33:51.989
The one who dies or the one who lives?

33:52.072 --> 33:54.450
Where is she? Where is the other one?

33:54.533 --> 33:57.536
You'll never find her
before we do, qezhtihn.

34:00.914 --> 34:03.917
I know who you are. You are Seb-Cheneb.

34:04.001 --> 34:06.044
You are the Destroyer!

34:06.128 --> 34:09.298
She's the end of all. She's the Destroyer.

34:19.683 --> 34:20.851
Damn.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.020
No!

34:29.359 --> 34:32.154
Let her go. She's fine.

34:32.237 --> 34:36.116
He's the one that needs to be disciplined.
Get him out of here. Get him out.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.911
And make sure your own sidearms
are fully secured.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.643
-Hi, sweetie.
-Mom.

35:02.726 --> 35:03.852
Sweetie, what's wrong?

35:03.936 --> 35:05.687
Mom. Mom, is Dahj okay?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.439
-What?
-Is she okay?

35:07.523 --> 35:10.859
Yes, sweetie. Dahj is fine.
I just heard from her today.

35:10.943 --> 35:14.863
She sounds like she's doing great.
She's thinking of adopting a puppy.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.615
I'm not sure that's the best idea.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.535
But you know Dahj,
when she makes a  plan...

35:38.011 --> 35:39.012
Enter.

35:47.104 --> 35:48.230
Are you all right?

35:57.614 --> 35:58.615
Hey.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.494
What happened?

36:03.120 --> 36:06.623
I have no idea. If you had asked me
five minutes beforehand,

36:06.707 --> 36:09.626
I would have said I didn't know anything
about a Romulan ship.

36:09.710 --> 36:13.213
I would have said that
I'd never even heard of the Shaenor

36:13.297 --> 36:15.090
or that Ramdha was on it.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.592
And would that have been the truth?

36:16.675 --> 36:19.928
I've probably read
every unclassified document

36:20.012 --> 36:22.723
that there is pertaining
to the history of this Cube.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.766
It must have been in there somewhere.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.561
Even Romulan censors
have to slip up sometimes.

36:31.398 --> 36:32.566
Do you believe me?

36:45.579 --> 36:46.997
Can you keep a secret?

36:54.838 --> 36:56.632
I may be falling in love with you.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.281
I'm back.

37:22.950 --> 37:24.326
So are your ears.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.411
I can smell her on you.

37:30.791 --> 37:32.793
The smell is remarkably...

37:34.252 --> 37:35.253
carnal.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.925
She really is an extraordinary
piece of machinery.

37:40.008 --> 37:41.385
What's she told you?

37:42.219 --> 37:45.472
Nothing yet. I'm not sure
what she consciously knows.

37:45.555 --> 37:49.810
But I'm sure she has no idea
what she truly is.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.520
And given what happened on Earth,

37:52.646 --> 37:55.107
I think we should keep it that way
as long as possible.

37:55.983 --> 37:57.859
Earth was a miscalculation.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.531
Your miscalculation.

38:04.908 --> 38:07.494
Which is the only reason
I agreed to let you pursue

38:07.577 --> 38:09.037
this highly questionable--

38:09.121 --> 38:11.331
-Far more subtle.
-Approach.

38:13.834 --> 38:17.129
Good luck, Brother.
And see that you don't fall in love.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.093
Nice to see you
looking like yourself again.

38:28.265 --> 38:30.559
You said you told Commodore Oh

38:30.642 --> 38:33.729
everything about our conversation
except for one thing.

38:33.812 --> 38:34.938
What was that?

38:36.773 --> 38:38.150
That I'm going with you...

38:39.735 --> 38:42.279
to look for the girl. Dahj.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.864
The other Dahj.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.783
You are going to look for her, right?

38:46.867 --> 38:50.996
That's what Oh thought, that you
were planning to get a ship and a pilot

38:51.079 --> 38:53.081
and go off looking for the second synth.

38:53.165 --> 38:54.166
Are you?

39:00.380 --> 39:01.381
You're early.

39:01.465 --> 39:04.176
Nope. My sources tell me--

39:04.259 --> 39:05.260
What sources?

39:05.343 --> 39:07.596
It's about to get very hot chez vous.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.056
It's already hot.

39:09.139 --> 39:11.475
- Hotter.
-Is that your pilot?

39:12.684 --> 39:15.854
Okay. You have to take me with you
and here's why:

39:15.937 --> 39:20.025
A, I just killed a man to save your life.

39:20.108 --> 39:25.197
B, you are a good, decent man
capable of empathy and pity.

39:25.280 --> 39:30.911
And I am a scientist who has spent
her entire life imagining a miracle,

39:30.994 --> 39:32.871
knowing that it could never come to pass.

39:32.954 --> 39:36.917
And now it has, and it's real.
And I have to see her.

39:37.459 --> 39:40.003
And C, I don't know how much it costs
to go where you're going

39:40.087 --> 39:42.297
or how much this guy charges.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.507
I'm expensive.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.592
But I am Agnes P. Jurati.

39:45.675 --> 39:47.719
I'm the Earth's leading expert
on synthetic life.

39:47.803 --> 39:51.181
And I promise you, if you take me
with you, I will more than earn my keep.

39:58.522 --> 39:59.940
Time to go.

40:09.699 --> 40:10.742
Raffi?

40:12.202 --> 40:13.411
What is this?

40:14.496 --> 40:15.622
"Sources."

40:16.957 --> 40:19.543
-I found Maddox.
-Where is he?

40:19.626 --> 40:21.837
I tell you, you promise
you'll take me with you?

40:21.920 --> 40:23.922
I would be honored to have you join me.

40:24.005 --> 40:27.676
Oh, no. No, I'm not joining you.
Never again.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.387
I'm just hitching a ride.

40:30.470 --> 40:31.638
To where?

40:31.721 --> 40:33.932
Bruce Maddox is on Freecloud.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.352
Freecloud. Yes, of course.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.146
Why do you wanna go to Freecloud?

40:39.604 --> 40:41.064
Have we met?

40:41.148 --> 40:42.440
Agnes Jurati.

40:43.775 --> 40:44.901
That's it?

40:44.985 --> 40:48.905
You're just gonna let Agnes here
hitch a ride on your top-secret mission?

40:48.989 --> 40:53.743
Doctor Jurati is the Earth's
leading expert on synthetic life.

40:53.827 --> 40:56.079
You didn't even ask me to run
any kind of security check.

40:56.163 --> 40:57.956
Not even the most basic.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.958
Why do you want to go to Freecloud?

41:00.041 --> 41:03.211
I'm under no obligation
to tell that to any of you.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.340
And once we get there you're on your own.

41:09.092 --> 41:10.552
Who are you, lady?

41:12.220 --> 41:13.597
Can we go already?

41:14.514 --> 41:15.515
Yes. Fine.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.611
Engage.
