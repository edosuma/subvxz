I am taking chamalla again

a flashing triple star,

We'll let the Admiral
sort it out.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.980
You are throwing away our
last chance to find Earth.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.316
And you'll be going back
to Galactica as mutineers.

BALTAR: (ON RADIO)
'Cause he will take your hand,

14:41.464 --> 14:43.715
and guide you to
the other side...

14:48.304 --> 14:49.846
NURSE: Are you feeling
a little better?

14:49.973 --> 14:51.557
WOMAN:
Can't you read a chart?

14:51.641 --> 14:53.559
I'm not gonna feel better.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.311
So take your needles and your
thermometers and your catheters

14:56.396 --> 14:58.605
and stick them where
the sun doesn't shine.

15:00.275 --> 15:04.069
BALTAR:... shuffle off
this mortal coil,

15:09.325 --> 15:10.284
Hello.

15:10.368 --> 15:14.079
Oh, great.
Now the President.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.206
She stuck me
three times today.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.586
Be thankful she hasn't
put a catheter in you.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.840
BALTAR:... where we will bask
in the radiance of God's love.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.510
All this just to

15:28.886 --> 15:31.054
keep me alive for
a few more days.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.308
It's so pointless.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.518
No, it's not pointless.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.398
And I'm sure it isn't helping
listening to Gaius Baltar.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.025
No, no, no,
don't touch that.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.319
Who the frak do
you think you are?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.196
Leave me alone.

15:55.913 --> 15:59.124
BALTAR: God doesn't really care
how many good deeds we've done.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.878
This is the mistake that I find
that so many of the pious...

16:03.796 --> 16:06.048
The Hybrid will want
to see you, I know it.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.132
Let's go, then.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.383
NATALIE: What are you doing?

16:08.468 --> 16:11.470
You want to give her access to the
central nervous system of this ship?

16:11.554 --> 16:12.554
I thought we had a deal.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.889
We discussed this.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.724
Kara's the key
to our salvation.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.267
We agreed on an alliance.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.603
You want an alliance,
I see the Hybrid.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.022
Leoben claims it can
help me find Earth.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.816
There's no way around it.

16:24.901 --> 16:28.195
We've tried to be patient about your
model's obsession with this woman.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.572
Playing house with her
on New Caprica was one thing,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.949
but this puts us
all in jeopardy.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.995
We have their Raptor and their
jump drive. We don't need them.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.038
Frakking toaster...

16:38.122 --> 16:39.539
Barolay, don't.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.751
You don't have time to figure out
our jump systems without our help.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.544
Not before
the other Cylons get back.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.588
And if we do
figure it out in time,

16:47.548 --> 16:48.882
do we just keep running?

16:48.966 --> 16:51.760
How long before we run out
of fuel, food, ammunition?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.012
How long before Cavil's
forces hunt us down?

16:54.097 --> 16:56.556
Like it or not, we have
to work with the Colonials.

16:56.641 --> 17:00.102
That means Kara
sees the Hybrid.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.479
Or you can kiss
your asses goodbye.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.150
Looks as if we
have no choice.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.196
But first, we do this.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.376
Okay, we can do this.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.628
We can give their ship
jump capability again

17:26.713 --> 17:29.339
by slaving its drives to our
Raptor's spin sync generator.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.882
So, just do it.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.551
Their Hybrid was
damaged in the attack,

17:32.635 --> 17:34.302
so we're gonna have
to pull her offline

17:34.429 --> 17:36.054
and execute jumps
from the Raptor.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.390
NATALIE: Pull the Hybrid
offline? Absolutely not.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.767
It's never been done
on an operational ship.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.811
It would be like blinding
her, might even kill her.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.895
You know, if we don't
get this done

17:43.980 --> 17:45.063
before the other
Cylons come back,

17:45.148 --> 17:46.481
we're all dead anyway.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.990
Make it happen,
Lieutenant.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.828
Barolay, yank the connectors
from the bus I showed you

17:59.912 --> 18:01.371
and strip the cables
out of them.

18:01.456 --> 18:02.706
Got it, L.T.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.251
And, Six, I'm gonna need
some data cabling right away.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.463
Single mode, 1310. Otherwise
you'll blow our system to shreds.

18:11.841 --> 18:15.302
STARBUCK: We started the
interface. Take me to this Hybrid.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.970
Anders, you're on me.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.306
Might be better
if I stay here.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.433
I know more about the
Raptor's system than they do.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.726
Fine.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.204
What the hell
are you looking at?

18:42.288 --> 18:43.872
I know you.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.292
You were on New Caprica. You
were part of the resistance.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.086
You killed me.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.088
Watched me drown,
kicking and thrashing

18:52.173 --> 18:54.841
like I was some
kind of an insect.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.135

put you down again.

Hey. Jean.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.335
You killed her.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.589
You frakking killed her!

19:40.096 --> 19:41.513
SAM: You want to know what
it feels like to die, huh?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.557
You're nothing!
You're a frakking machine!

19:43.641 --> 19:45.350
Sam, put the gun down now!

19:45.434 --> 19:46.518
Sam, stop!

19:46.602 --> 19:47.686
What do you want
me to do, Kara?

19:47.770 --> 19:49.396
SAM: You want me to
forget about Barolay?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.064
You want me to forget
about New Caprica?

19:51.148 --> 19:53.024
No frakking way!
She just killed Barolay!

19:53.109 --> 19:55.735
Sam! Put the gun down.

19:56.821 --> 19:57.821
Put it down.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.072
SAM: I'm not gonna do it.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.246
STARBUCK: Sam.

20:06.330 --> 20:11.042
Sam, you have no idea
what's at stake here.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.546
Look at me. Put it down.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.883
They killed one of us and you're
just ready to let it slide?

20:17.967 --> 20:21.219
She's right.
You can't let this go, Kara.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.390
If you don't want
to do this, I will.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.142
Put the gun down, soldier.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.313
I need to see the Hybrid.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.649
Why, sister?

20:34.734 --> 20:37.485
I just couldn't let it go.
On New Caprica...

20:37.570 --> 20:38.737
She was the one?

20:38.821 --> 20:40.697
I never did anything to her.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.075
We were working at the water
treatment plant, and she just...

20:44.160 --> 20:46.369
I know. I remember.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.914
After you downloaded, we
tried to work through this.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.416
How do you work through
something like that?

20:52.501 --> 20:55.837
Never forget her expression
as I tried to scream.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.926
Just slapped tape
over my mouth

21:01.010 --> 21:02.761
and threw me in
that septic tank.

21:02.845 --> 21:04.262

your frakking mouth.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.932
I still see her face
when I try and sleep.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.936
We were trying to
help these people.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.312
I know.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.523
I know. I wish there
was something I could do.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.575
Allow them to caress
your associative mind.

27:41.285 --> 27:44.787
Don't expect the fate of two
great races to be delivered easily.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.622
HYBRID: Assume the
relaxation length of photons

27:46.707 --> 27:48.750
in the sample
atmosphere is constant.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.002
The intruders
swarmed like flame.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.503
Like the whirlwind.

27:52.588 --> 27:55.798
Hopes soaring to slaughter all
their best against our hulls.

28:23.285 --> 28:27.538
HYBRID: All these things at once and
many more. Not because it wishes harm,

28:27.623 --> 28:31.125
but because it likes violent
vibrations to change constantly.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.586
ATHENA: Hey,
we're rigged and ready.

28:33.670 --> 28:34.837
It's time to pull her offline
and get out of here

28:34.922 --> 28:36.714
before we miss
the rendezvous.

28:36.799 --> 28:38.633
Reset.
Any luck, Captain?

28:39.218 --> 28:40.676
Not a frakking thing.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.055
But you are
a spark of God's fire.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.681
Core update complete.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.100
Frak it!
Unplug the damn thing.

28:47.184 --> 28:48.559
Let's get
the frak out of here.

28:48.644 --> 28:51.062
HYBRID: Threat detection
matrix enabled.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.356
Dendritic response bypassed.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.275
The received dose is altered
by the delayed gamma burst.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.736
Going active. Execute.

28:58.821 --> 29:02.240
The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.

29:02.324 --> 29:03.658
End of line.

29:04.118 --> 29:05.368
(SCREAMING)

29:09.998 --> 29:11.332
Stop!

29:17.673 --> 29:19.173
What the hell happened?

29:37.901 --> 29:39.902
What do you want from me?

29:40.446 --> 29:42.864
Please, I need you.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.584
Thus will it come to pass.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.880
The dying leader will know
the truth of the opera house.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.591
The missing three
will give you the five

30:01.675 --> 30:04.385
who have come from
the home of the 13th.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.929
You are the harbinger
of death, Kara Thrace.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.724
You will lead them
all to their end.

30:12.269 --> 30:13.561
End of line.

30:30.621 --> 30:35.583
ROSLIN: But this god that Baltar
refers to, it is the Cylon God.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.252
You know that,
don't you?

30:38.337 --> 30:40.421
EMILY: If he's
the one and true God,

30:40.839 --> 30:43.049
he belongs to all of us.

30:43.509 --> 30:46.219
Otherwise, he's not
much of a God, is he?

30:46.303 --> 30:49.222
Exactly. He isn't much
of a God, he's a fantasy.

30:49.306 --> 30:53.017
Laura. And the Lords of Kobol are real?

30:53.101 --> 30:54.268
(CHUCKLES)

30:54.478 --> 30:58.648
Reigning from a metaphysical
mountaintop in those silly outfits.

30:59.274 --> 31:02.026
Zeus handing out fates

31:02.110 --> 31:05.196
out of an urn like they
were lottery tickets.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.199
"You're gonna work on a tylium
ship. You're gonna be an admiral.

31:08.283 --> 31:12.870
"Your family's gonna be evaporated
in an attack on the colonies,

31:12.955 --> 31:15.039
"but you'll survive
for three more years

31:15.123 --> 31:17.416
"in a moldy compartment
on a freighter

31:17.501 --> 31:20.461
"till your body starts
to eat itself up alive. "

31:22.464 --> 31:24.840
Those are the Gods
that you worship?

31:24.967 --> 31:27.385
Capricious, vindictive.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.972
But they're not meant
to be taken literally.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.975
They're metaphors, Emily.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.977
I don't need metaphors.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.980
I need answers.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.442
You're like my mother. She wasn't
satisfied with metaphors either.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.444
She was convinced
that Aphrodite herself

31:45.529 --> 31:47.154
was gonna swoop her
away when she died,

31:47.239 --> 31:48.656
and she believed it.

31:48.740 --> 31:54.328
Even after the doloxan and the
radiation failed to stop her cancer.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.790
She was a teacher.
She was a...

31:57.874 --> 32:01.627
She was something
to behold in...

32:01.712 --> 32:05.715
At the head of a classroom,
and her students...

32:08.385 --> 32:10.553
Her students loved her.
They...

32:11.263 --> 32:12.888
They'd walk
through fire for her.

32:12.973 --> 32:15.224
And then you see
this woman who

32:17.269 --> 32:18.519
seemed so

32:21.982 --> 32:24.191
eternal, she

32:26.153 --> 32:29.405
withered away,
and I find myself

32:29.489 --> 32:32.408
having to change her diaper
because she couldn't even...

32:36.705 --> 32:37.788
And at the moment she died,

32:37.873 --> 32:40.958
there was no gleaming fields of
Elysium stretched out before her.

32:41.043 --> 32:43.961
There was this dark

32:46.048 --> 32:48.007
black abyss.

32:52.763 --> 32:55.640
And she was just terrified.

32:55.891 --> 32:58.809
She was so scared.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.228
I'm sorry.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.233
Laura.

33:11.239 --> 33:15.242
Laura, you were terrified.

33:16.036 --> 33:19.038
You saw only darkness.

33:19.122 --> 33:23.918
You can't possibly know
what your mother experienced.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.755
You're still searching.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.424
(COUGHING)

33:31.510 --> 33:33.594
Doc Cottle! Doc!

33:34.429 --> 33:35.429
ROSLIN: Do something.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.598
Nurse, get me
some morpha quickly.

33:40.686 --> 33:41.977
ROSLIN: It's okay.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.856
It's all right.

33:55.909 --> 34:00.246
All we can do for her now is
try to make her comfortable.

34:02.499 --> 34:03.791
That's all?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.209
I'm sorry, that's it.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.462
All right.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.319
It's as if she doesn't
even see us anymore.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.196
She's looking past us.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.949
I've seen that
look many times,

34:37.033 --> 34:39.201
but never in
the eyes of a Cylon.

34:39.828 --> 34:43.998
Athena, you were right.

34:47.961 --> 34:49.628
Forgive me.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.869
It's okay.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.205
I'm with you.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.654
SAM: She will lead us
to the end.

35:56.738 --> 35:59.490
We will now know
the truth of the opera house.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.617
The home of the 13th.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.035
STARBUCK: What?

36:03.537 --> 36:05.287
NATALIE: The Hybrid said,
"The missing three

36:05.372 --> 36:09.667
"will give you the five who've
come from the home of the 13th. "

36:09.751 --> 36:12.545
The home of
the 13th tribe of humans.

36:13.713 --> 36:18.342
And the five is your
final five Cylon models.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.595
If they've come from the
home of the Thirteenth Tribe,

36:21.680 --> 36:23.514
then they must
know the way back.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.349
They know how
to get to Earth.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.311
And the missing three
is the model you boxed

36:29.396 --> 36:30.813
for looking at
the faces of the five.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.147
D'Anna.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.110
She can recognize them.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.448
Let's go.
Demetrius is waiting for us.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.817
EMILY: We're here.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.108
Mother.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.199
You're okay.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.667
I'm not ready.

38:28.098 --> 38:31.850
BALTAR:... your heart to him and you
no longer need to fear the unknown.

38:35.105 --> 38:36.897
Because he will
take your hand

38:39.067 --> 38:42.069
and guide you to
the other side of the river.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.115
What river am I
talking about?

38:47.784 --> 38:51.453
I'm talking about the river that
separates this world from the next.

38:52.872 --> 38:59.795
There is more to reality than the
things that we can touch, taste,

38:59.879 --> 39:02.131
or even see with
our naked eyes.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.758
There is another realm.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.058
All hands to jump stations.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.727
Prepare to jump the ship.

39:14.811 --> 39:19.898
All hands to jump stations.
Prepare to jump the ship.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.787
Come on.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.507
Come on, come on.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.684

39:57.312 --> 39:58.604

39:58.688 --> 40:01.106

Nav is go.

ATHENA: Demetrius, Athena.
Demetrius, Athena.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.797
Gods, it's good
to hear your voice.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.966
Copy that, Helo.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.093
The Baseship is ours.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.303
Mission accomplished.

41:13.388 --> 41:15.222
Then let's go home.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.270

41:27.360 --> 41:29.069
I need to talk to you.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.404
Certainly. Come in.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.738
Thank you.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.032
Can I get you some water?

41:34.117 --> 41:35.242
ROSLIN: Yes.

41:36.703 --> 41:39.454
You really believe that there's
something in this horse manure

41:39.539 --> 41:42.166
that Baltar's peddling?

41:43.168 --> 41:44.710
I don't know.

41:45.503 --> 41:49.047
Something is happening here, and
I don't really understand it, Bill.

41:50.675 --> 41:54.344
You both had
the same dream, means...

41:58.725 --> 42:02.102
What? Talk to me.
What's going on?

42:07.233 --> 42:09.276
Kara comes back
from the dead.

42:10.820 --> 42:14.198
I let her go off
chasing her vision of Earth.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.284
She's overdue.

Helo, Athena, Gaeta, will
I ever see those kids again?

42:34.802 --> 42:37.596
Bill, look at me.

42:38.848 --> 42:40.432
I'm right here.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.310
Right here.

42:45.647 --> 42:47.105
We're going to find it.

Earth?

42:50.318 --> 42:51.693
Together.

42:52.487 --> 42:54.696
I used to think it was
such a pipe dream.

42:55.823 --> 42:58.325
I used to use it as
a carrot for the Fleet.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.411
What made you change?

43:03.373 --> 43:04.539
You.
