WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:05.939
"Not expressly stated."

00:06.074 --> 00:10.178
Five letters,
second one is an "A."

00:10.311 --> 00:12.813
How about "tacit"?

00:12.946 --> 00:14.782
No wonder
I haven't been able
to finish a crossword

00:14.915 --> 00:17.017
since you moved in
with Max.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.352
How is he,
by the way?

00:18.486 --> 00:20.421
I wouldn't know.
We broke up.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.456
What?
How did I not know?

00:22.590 --> 00:24.458
When did he move out?
He didn't.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.360
His parents own the place.
It's one of their rentals.

00:26.494 --> 00:27.961
So I'm staying
on the pullout
in the office.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.363
You're sleeping
in your family restaurant?
Before you freak out,

00:29.497 --> 00:31.031
it's just temporary.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.733
Come sleep on my couch.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.203
I'll help you binge-eat
your way past Max,

00:35.336 --> 00:37.471
and you can
help me figure out
the three-letter word

00:37.605 --> 00:39.373
for "it has benefits."

00:44.545 --> 00:46.013
Uh, give me a minute?

00:46.147 --> 00:47.348
Mmm-hmm.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.024
This is Park.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.894
Yes. Of course.

01:09.637 --> 01:10.871
Sir, I'm sorry.

01:11.004 --> 01:13.207
Can you hold
for just one moment?

01:13.341 --> 01:15.243
Hey, everything okay?

01:15.376 --> 01:17.545
Landlord troubles.
Story of my life.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.879
Didn't look like
landlord trouble.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.414
J-O-B.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.550
Three across.
"It has benefits."

01:22.683 --> 01:24.752
The answer's "job."
Go do yours.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.887
I'll call you tonight.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.566
Agent Park.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.569
Why is it the really wealthy
always want to own
a restaurant?

01:41.702 --> 01:43.904
I'm sure for some
it has a lot to do

01:44.037 --> 01:47.575
with glad-handing
and backslapping.

01:47.708 --> 01:51.245
For me, it was sort of
a friend in need.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.113
Now it's a project.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.081
We're expanding.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.350
And this, an office.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.252
With a stove
and a walk-in.

01:58.386 --> 01:59.520
Are you hungry?
I could make you
an omelet.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.522
No, thank you.
I ate.
Coffee?

02:01.655 --> 02:02.956
Cooper's tied up
at Main Justice.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.325
He said you had a case.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.595
What do you know
about the Nuremberg trials?

02:07.728 --> 02:10.097
Military tribunals
after World War II.

02:10.231 --> 02:13.100
Allied Forces prosecuting
Nazi leadership
for war crimes.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.603
They gave the devil
his day in court

02:15.736 --> 02:18.672
and invented simultaneous
translation to do it.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.608
Are you giving me a case
or a history lesson?

02:20.741 --> 02:23.577
If it weren't for
the Allies' desire

02:23.711 --> 02:26.347
to give Goering
a fair trial,

02:26.480 --> 02:29.049
the Wellstone Agency
might not exist.

02:29.183 --> 02:32.286
In fact, it doesn't exist,
not officially.

02:32.420 --> 02:36.424
And yet its services
have made thousands

02:36.557 --> 02:39.427
of illicit business
transactions possible.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.094
A translation service
for crooks.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.730
Crime is a global trade.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.798
Criminals
need to communicate,

02:44.932 --> 02:48.402
and that requires
interpreters they can trust.

02:48.536 --> 02:51.171
The Wellstone Agency
provides just that.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.307
A bunch of translators.

02:53.441 --> 02:58.712
I believe Agent Keen recently
acquired Wellstone's services.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.915
If we find
the interpreter she used,

03:02.049 --> 03:04.151
we may be able
to find her.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.953
Why come to us?
You're a criminal.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.521
Haven't you used
this company before?

03:07.655 --> 03:09.189
I have.

03:09.323 --> 03:14.795
But my point person and I
recently had a falling out,

03:14.928 --> 03:18.699
and without him,
I have no way to reach
the senior leadership.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.435
I need your help
to get inside the company.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.937
Have you considered
simply leaving Keen alone,

03:24.071 --> 03:26.507
taking a breath to consider
your role in all this?

03:28.276 --> 03:30.210
Harold isn't in
a meeting, is he?

03:30.344 --> 03:32.246
No.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.983
I came here to tell you
I think what you're
doing is wrong.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.386
You're only
making things worse
for Keen by pursuing her.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.821
It's Paula.
Glen's mother.

03:40.954 --> 03:44.258
She says
she needs to see you.
Says its urgent.

03:44.392 --> 03:49.897
Agent Park, next time you feel
the urge to unburden yourself,

03:50.030 --> 03:53.367
you can rest assured,
I've heard it all before.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.203
It's a luxury to stand
on the moral high ground

03:56.337 --> 03:58.806
and critique those of us
on the low ground.

03:58.939 --> 04:02.376
A lot of people
do exactly that.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.177
Until they need my help.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.746
I'll never
ask for your help.

04:05.879 --> 04:09.016
And yet here I am
asking for yours.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.285
The Wellstone Agency.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.487
It's the next name
on the Blacklist.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.063
According to Reddington,

04:23.196 --> 04:25.098
the agency's inner workings
are cloaked in secrecy.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.867
Even their own interpreters
are kept in the dark

04:27.000 --> 04:28.536
as to who runs
the organization.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.103
So how do they
communicate?

04:30.237 --> 04:32.239
Through dispatchers
who contact
the criminal parties,

04:32.373 --> 04:34.442
arrange payments,
and assign interpreters.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.876
The dispatch has
all the information.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.545
The interpreters
know nothing.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.480
But Reddington's lost contact
with his dispatch,

04:39.613 --> 04:42.616
so what's our in?
His interpreter.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.052
Wellstone relies on
its interpreters
for referrals.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.820
It's how they
recruit translators.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.056
So Reddington's interpreter's
gonna refer someone we pick.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.859
And that person
gets brought in and vetted,

04:51.992 --> 04:53.827
giving him a window
to access the system

04:53.961 --> 04:56.263
and get the name
of the interpreter
Keen used.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.499
Maybe the name of the person
she was negotiating with

04:58.632 --> 04:59.900
and for what.
Under normal circumstances,

05:00.033 --> 05:01.669
I'd reach out
to Language Analysis.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.638
But what
our interpreter learns
may compromise Keen.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.640
So I want
to keep this in-house.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.075
Well,
I only speak English.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.276
I speak Korean.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.478
Does sign language count?

05:10.611 --> 05:12.946
Definitely not.
Then I'm down to six.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.082
You speak
six languages?

05:15.215 --> 05:16.450
Well, not including Latin,

05:16.584 --> 05:18.285
which I doubt
would come in handy,

05:18.419 --> 05:20.153
unless the criminal
I interpreted for
was the Pope.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.689
Imagine that confessional.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.090
Park, reach out
to Reddington.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.558
Tell him Aram's going in

05:24.692 --> 05:26.293
and to arrange a meeting
with his contact.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.762
Ressler, start laying
the groundwork
for a cover story.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.101
As if I'm not already
asking you to do too much,

05:34.234 --> 05:36.837
I need you to try
and open this drive.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.739
Okay. Is this
about a case?

05:38.872 --> 05:40.273
I'm not sure.

05:40.408 --> 05:41.775
Which is why I need you
to keep this between us.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.777
Nobody knows.
Especially Reddington.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.721
Paula, hi.
Steven.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.423
I got your message.
Is everything alright?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.458
Oh, thanks for coming.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.292
Hello, Bill.

05:59.427 --> 06:02.696
Oh, uh, the girls and I
were just tasting the cakes.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.633
Come in.

06:05.766 --> 06:09.770
Oh, would either of you
like a slice of cake?

06:09.903 --> 06:14.608
Um, lemon, carrot,
and pink champagne.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.510
No, thank you.
Maybe later.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.612
What are we celebrating,
Paula?

06:20.881 --> 06:24.685
Maybe you boys
should sit down.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.319
Is Glen here?

06:28.856 --> 06:31.892
Glen transitioned.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.328
I don't know
what that means.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.366
He died.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.401
What?
What do you mean?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.103
From West Nile.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.139
W...
Oh, come on.
Come on.

06:46.273 --> 06:50.143
If this is one of Glen's
dreadful practical jokes...

06:50.277 --> 06:52.646
I would have gotten
in touch sooner,

06:52.780 --> 06:57.150
but I have been so busy
with the planning
and the party.

06:57.284 --> 07:00.588
He didn't want a regular
funeral, you know.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.524
Jelly Bean
wanted his friends
to send him off

07:03.657 --> 07:06.026
with a real shindig.

07:06.159 --> 07:12.332
A potluck with dancing,
and Huey, of course.

07:12.466 --> 07:13.834
West Nile?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.236
Paula, I am so sorry.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.771
Oh, thank you, Bill.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.439
When did this happen?

07:19.573 --> 07:22.109
A bit over
two weeks ago.

07:22.242 --> 07:26.814
I know. I should've called,
but you slipped my mind.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.783
And then Trudy and I
were going through

07:29.917 --> 07:34.154
some of their dirty letters,
and we found this.

07:37.891 --> 07:41.094
I was halfway inclined
to open it,

07:41.228 --> 07:45.799
but you were his friend,
and I want to respect
his wishes.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.868
He didn't send me
no letter.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.103
Hey, Paula, what do you
think about Luke

07:50.237 --> 07:51.772
bringing his
chicken tater bake?

07:51.905 --> 07:55.643
I think
it'd be real popular.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.110
I can't believe
this is happening.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.412
Boys, I gotta go.

07:59.547 --> 08:02.449
There is too much to do
before Huey gets here.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.318
But do come
to the party.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.487
Jelly'd want you there,

08:07.621 --> 08:11.759
tomorrow at 7:00
at the DMV.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.461
And don't forget
to bring a covered dish

08:14.595 --> 08:15.963
and your own tableware.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.167
What the hell?

08:35.949 --> 08:37.450
She was lucky
to get out.

08:37.585 --> 08:38.886
Jenna.
Hey.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.088
I came as soon
as I got your text.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.590
What happened?

08:42.723 --> 08:44.057
Fire in the kitchen.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.560
The smoke alarm
didn't work.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.096
The doctors are prepping
for surgery now.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.164
But she's gonna be okay?

08:51.298 --> 08:53.500
They...

08:53.634 --> 08:54.968
They don't know.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.872
Hey, talk to me.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.574
What's going on?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.313
Last year,
we started to fall
behind at the restaurant.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.881
The banks
wouldn't touch us,

09:08.015 --> 09:09.883
so Melissa went to
a local guy for help.

09:11.518 --> 09:12.953
You borrowed
from a loan shark?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.988
And it did help
for a while.

09:15.122 --> 09:18.058
But this month...

09:18.191 --> 09:20.327
It's the fourth payment
we missed in six months.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.062
This is the guy who came
to see you yesterday.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.363
He did this to Melissa.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.732
I knew it was dangerous
not to pay,

09:24.865 --> 09:25.999
but I didn't think
they'd do this.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.736
What's his name?

09:28.869 --> 09:31.004
He works
with other people.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.572
They'll come for us.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.341
That won't happen.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.543
I promise.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.011
Let me
take care of this.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.515
She was living there.
You know that?

09:42.650 --> 09:44.017
Melissa,
the youngest daughter.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.353
What, are you gonna arrest me?
For what?

09:46.486 --> 09:48.555
Loan-sharking. Arson.
Attempted murder.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.891
I don't know where you got
your information from,

09:51.024 --> 09:52.660
but nobody would be
stupid enough

09:52.793 --> 09:53.894
to point the finger
at me.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.229
Is that a threat?

09:56.363 --> 09:58.431
Did you just threaten
my witness?
Take it easy.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.533
Because that's sure as hell
how it sounded.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.069
Honestly, the gall!

10:02.202 --> 10:04.772
After all I've already
done for him?

10:04.905 --> 10:07.574
All the jobs,
the attention paid.

10:07.708 --> 10:12.379
All the time spent
suffering his antics.

10:12.512 --> 10:15.215
All the money,
that ridiculous sports car.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.384
He was a civil servant,
Raymond.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.952
How could he explain
all that stuff?

10:19.086 --> 10:21.388
The money and all.
I understand that.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.457
But why is it
somehow my job

10:24.591 --> 10:28.161
to help explain away
the fortune I paid him?

10:28.295 --> 10:29.697
He had to
say something.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.931
Something, yes.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.801
But the man
told everyone he knew

10:33.934 --> 10:36.603
that he was
Huey Lewis's muse.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.807
How in any stretch
of the imagination

10:39.940 --> 10:44.311
does that explain his crazy,
extravagant lifestyle?

10:44.444 --> 10:47.247
What, Huey Lewis bought him
a red Mercedes?

10:47.380 --> 10:49.416
And does Huey Lewis
even have a muse?

10:49.549 --> 10:54.054
Did Glen
really tell his mother
Huey would attend?

10:54.187 --> 10:56.023
"This friendship
with Huey

10:56.156 --> 10:58.191
"has always accounted
for everything,

10:58.325 --> 11:00.460
"my travels to Europe
and Bangkok,

11:00.593 --> 11:03.997
"all the cash, the cars,
everything in Vegas..."

11:04.131 --> 11:06.499
I mean, I can't even...

11:06.633 --> 11:09.636
"Even the absence
of any other
long-term relationship

11:09.770 --> 11:11.304
"over the last 30 years.

11:11.438 --> 11:15.375
"Huey is, in a word,
the reason." Two words.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.278
"Which is why his failure
to attend my memorial

11:18.411 --> 11:21.014
"would be seen
as a snub so great

11:21.148 --> 11:23.283
"that I'm afraid
it may send Mother

11:23.416 --> 11:25.285
"into a heartbroken tailspin

11:25.418 --> 11:27.654
"which she may never
recover from."

11:27.788 --> 11:28.856
Mmm.
I mean...

11:28.989 --> 11:30.523
Talk about
the power of love.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.526
How is this possible?

11:33.660 --> 11:36.864
It's as if he's reaching up
from the grave

11:36.997 --> 11:40.633
to torment and abuse me
one last time.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.669
Raymond,
Glen needs you.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.037
To do what?

11:44.171 --> 11:46.039
To bird-dog
some pop star

11:46.173 --> 11:49.109
to inform him that
his most beloved songs

11:49.242 --> 11:53.480
were inspired by his bromance
with a clerk from the DMV?

11:53.613 --> 11:56.850
He needs you to convince Huey
to come to his memorial.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.518
Well,
I'm not doing it.

11:58.651 --> 11:59.853
It's his dying wish.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.322
No, it's one
of his dying wishes.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.124
What's the other?
Forget it.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.859
What does it say?

12:09.329 --> 12:13.233
Ah. "Mother wants to place
my remains on her mantel.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.502
"I don't like the idea
of spending my days

12:15.635 --> 12:17.337
"looking down on Mother,

12:17.470 --> 12:20.874
"so I want you to abscond
with my ashes
and spread them."

12:21.008 --> 12:22.209
Spread them where?

12:25.078 --> 12:28.215
"I want to spend eternity
at the glorious feet

12:28.348 --> 12:31.518
"of that grand dame,
the Statue of Liberty."

12:31.651 --> 12:34.587
I don't think it's legal
to spread ashes
on Liberty Island.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.556
Well, it doesn't matter,
because I'm not doing it.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.359
I'm not lying to Paula
or spreading his ashes...

12:39.492 --> 12:43.363
...and I'm certainly not
hunting down Huey Lewis

12:43.496 --> 12:48.235
or begging him
to come to Glen's
potluck memorial.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.375
What is it?
It's Glen's mom.

12:55.508 --> 12:59.847
She's asking if you can
bake a tray of scotcheroos.

12:59.980 --> 13:00.747
They're short
on desserts.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.215
Okay.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.921
Raymond, you know
we have to do this.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.389
For Glen.

13:14.361 --> 13:18.398
See if you can find
Mr. Lewis's address.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.967
But I'm not breaking
into the Statue of Liberty

13:20.100 --> 13:22.235
to spread Glen's ashes.

13:23.503 --> 13:27.607
Stealing from Wellstone
is a terrible idea,

13:27.740 --> 13:29.542
but Reddington's made it clear
I have to vouch for you

13:29.676 --> 13:30.911
and get you
inside the company.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.313
So let me be blunt.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.015
I'm not your friend.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.384
I think that this is
a suicide mission.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.652
And the only reason
I'm helping you

13:39.786 --> 13:41.855
is so that we both
don't end up dead.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.391
Okay, let me try
and say this
back to you.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.394
I take the pill.
I black out.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.629
Then I wake up in the custody
of people I don't know

13:49.762 --> 13:53.433
for a test I might pass
in the hopes I get the job

13:53.566 --> 13:55.368
instead of
getting killed?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.337
I told you
it's a bad idea.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.406
Okay, if I could
just get to...
It won't work.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.475
All I need is the name
of one client's translator.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.278
They have to have logs of...
You're not listening.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.347
These people run
a criminal enterprise.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.416
They traffic in secrets.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.184
And to protect those secrets,
they will not hesitate

14:11.318 --> 14:13.286
to kill you or me,

14:13.420 --> 14:15.288
or anyone else
they think is a liability.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.001
It's your funeral.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.522
Whoa.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.433
Welcome back,
Mr. Stone.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.302
Did you have a nice rest?

15:02.435 --> 15:05.038
I, uh, don't remember
getting here.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.706
My name's Miss Jessica.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.342
I'm here to discuss the matrix
of tests we'll administer

15:09.476 --> 15:10.877
to see if you're
a candidate
for Wellstone.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.879
Matrix of tests?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.681
Uh, what tests?

15:14.814 --> 15:16.549
I'm so glad you asked.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.752
<i>We'll begin with a simple</i>
<i>polygraph-augmented</i>
<i>consultation.</i>

15:19.886 --> 15:22.255
<i>Baseline questions.</i>
<i>Work profile.</i>
<i>Personal history.</i>

15:22.389 --> 15:24.691
<i>Relevant experience as well</i>
<i>as potential conflicts.</i>

15:24.824 --> 15:26.059
<i>And we'll follow that</i>
<i>with an aptitude test</i>

15:26.193 --> 15:28.061
<i>and behavioral inquiry.</i>

15:28.195 --> 15:29.529
<i>Of course, we'll want</i>
<i>to gauge the strength</i>

15:29.662 --> 15:31.131
<i>of your language</i>
<i>of expertise.</i>

15:31.264 --> 15:33.033
<i>Dialects. Prose. As well as</i>
<i>vocabulary and expression.</i>

15:37.837 --> 15:39.706
<i>And we'll audit that</i>
<i>with some mock sessions,</i>

15:39.839 --> 15:41.908
<i>scripted scenarios</i>
<i>based on actual encounters</i>

15:42.042 --> 15:43.943
<i>to test neutrality,</i>
<i>composure, and patience.</i>

15:48.581 --> 15:50.683
But before all of that,
I do want to stress

15:50.817 --> 15:53.720
that our
primary objective here
at Wellstone is privacy.

15:53.853 --> 15:56.356
Without discretion,
we can't protect
our clients,

15:56.489 --> 15:58.258
ourselves, or you.

15:58.391 --> 16:02.395
So, Mr. Stone,
can you be discreet?

16:02.529 --> 16:04.564
Yes, I'm Mr. Discreet.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.140
You wanted to see me?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.608
The arrest that
you made earlier.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.977
Mason Dieterle.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.947
Yeah, he burned down
my friend's restaurant.

16:21.081 --> 16:25.752
I just got off the phone with
the AUSA reviewing the case.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.621
He told me that your friend
passed away from her injuries.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.057
I'm sorry.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.273
He also told me
that he declined
to file charges

16:46.406 --> 16:48.675
for either arson
or attempted murder.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.577
What? Why?

16:50.710 --> 16:53.813
He... He burned
down that diner.
This was arson.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.982
The AUSA said he didn't have
any evidence to prove that.

16:56.116 --> 16:59.619
Can you prove
that Dieterle was
responsible for that fire?

16:59.752 --> 17:01.054
Do you have a witness?

17:01.188 --> 17:03.156
A print on
a can of gasoline
or accelerant?

17:03.290 --> 17:04.424
No, I just thought...

17:04.557 --> 17:06.859
That's the problem.

17:06.993 --> 17:10.063
You didn't think.
You reacted.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.565
Dieterle was arraigned
on a loan-sharking charge

17:12.699 --> 17:14.534
and made bail
20 minutes ago.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.236
I'm concerned, Alina.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.505
You have a history
of acting on your anger,

17:18.638 --> 17:20.973
at times
letting your emotions
get the better of you.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.475
Now your friend is dead,

17:22.609 --> 17:24.043
and the man that you think
is responsible

17:24.177 --> 17:25.578
is back on the street.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.180
I need you to promise me

17:27.314 --> 17:30.250
that you will not
do anything about that.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.918
Do I have your word?

17:33.953 --> 17:35.054
Yes.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.124
You do.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.227
Mr. Lewis,
I just want to say
it's a privilege.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.029
I mean, great pleasure
to meet you.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.498
Well, I appreciate that.
Thank you very much.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.400
Thank you for agreeing
to see me.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.836
I take it you're something
of a culinary man.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.504
I love to cook.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.072
Uh, to be honest,
Mr. Homan...

17:53.206 --> 17:54.474
Steve, please.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.643
Okay,
to be honest, Steve,

17:56.776 --> 17:58.711
I only agreed
because my manager insisted.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.581
Ah, I did Jerry
a favor once.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.083
Well,
a friend of Jerry's.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.652
Must've been, uh,
quite a favor.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.888
Uh, can I
get you something,
like coffee or...

18:09.021 --> 18:10.723
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Thank you, thank you.

18:10.857 --> 18:14.627
I don't want to take up
any more of your time
than necessary.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.296
Mmm-hmm.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.466
I'm here because
a dear friend of mine

18:19.599 --> 18:22.435
passed away recently.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.671
Pillar of his community.
Mmm-hmm.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.439
Loved his mother, Paula.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.808
Wonderful, wonderful woman.
Mmm-hmm.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.043
And he...

18:31.178 --> 18:36.516
Well, he absolutely
cherished your music.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.719
He knew every word
of every song.
Oh.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.188
Really.

18:41.321 --> 18:45.558
Now, I realize it's a bit
of a long shot,

18:45.692 --> 18:48.261
but I was wondering
if you might consider,

18:48.395 --> 18:49.762
for a price, of course,

18:49.896 --> 18:54.567
might consider attending
his memorial service

18:54.701 --> 18:57.103
at the Rockville,
Maryland, DMV.

18:57.237 --> 19:00.006
It's tonight,
7:00 p.m.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.474
The DMV?

19:01.608 --> 19:03.976
Yes, Glen was
regional manager.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.746
Did, um...
Did Jerry know

19:06.879 --> 19:09.316
that this is what
you wanted to ask me?

19:09.449 --> 19:12.919
As I said, uh, I sort of
did him a favor once.

19:13.052 --> 19:16.022
To play the funeral
of some guy
at the DMV?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.524
Regional manager.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.091
You do know
that Quincy Jones

19:19.226 --> 19:20.693
asked me to sing
on <i>We Are The World.</i>

19:20.827 --> 19:23.930
Ah, uh,
a stirring performance.

19:24.063 --> 19:27.567
And a great honor and...
And tribute.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.970
Love of your fellow man
and all that.

19:32.572 --> 19:39.145
Not entirely unlike the love
a son might have
for his mother.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.114
A desire
to make her proud.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.583
To impress her.
Mmm-hmm.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.386
Things were said
through the years.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.221
I think he...

19:49.522 --> 19:52.024
He told his mother
he inspired you

19:52.158 --> 19:53.926
to record
<i>Workin' for a Livin'</i>

19:54.060 --> 19:56.195
after a rousing game
of beer pong

19:56.329 --> 19:57.497
in the back of a bar
in Teaneck.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.198
And she believed him?
Believed him?

19:59.332 --> 20:01.901
Oh, no, no.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.171
To her, it would
make perfect sense

20:05.305 --> 20:08.207
that her son
was singularly responsible

20:08.341 --> 20:10.677
for your legendary song.

20:10.810 --> 20:15.482
And that you, who benefited
from her son's inspiration,

20:15.615 --> 20:18.651
would want
more than anything
to show up

20:18.785 --> 20:21.988
at his memorial service
to pay your respects.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.723
Okay.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.792
Is... Is this a joke?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.960
Did... Did Ralphie
put you up to this?

20:28.094 --> 20:29.562
I am so sorry.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.932
I mean it.
You can name your price.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.601
To play
the Rockville DMV?

20:34.734 --> 20:37.370
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to play.

20:37.504 --> 20:39.872
Just show up.
Say a few words.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.642
Plus, if you do,
I'll owe you a favor.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.412
I'm a good person
to have in your debt.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.180
So you'll do
whatever I ask?

20:48.315 --> 20:49.582
Absolutely.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.784
Great.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.286
Then I'm gonna ask you
to please leave

20:53.420 --> 20:55.288
because I got an interview
across town in an hour,

20:55.422 --> 20:58.257
and I got to eat
and get ready,
and I don't want to be late.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.926
Sorry.
You have to go.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.266
Thank you, Mr. Stone.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.602
Miss Jessica will be
with you momentarily.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.237
Okay.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.536
Yes.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.649
This is certainly
unexpected.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.551
That is what I thought.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.823
What happened
to being discreet?
Excuse me?

22:03.956 --> 22:07.927
I was waiting for you
when I spilled my soda.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.130
Then I came to your desk
for a tissue

22:11.263 --> 22:14.467
when I found this
on your computer.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.572
Is this how this works?
I don't follow.

22:19.706 --> 22:23.543
All of you people
are putting me through
a matrix of tests

22:23.676 --> 22:25.878
to find out
if you can trust me,

22:26.012 --> 22:29.749
and yet you carelessly
leave this client profile

22:29.882 --> 22:31.851
open on your laptop.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.921
What if I were
an FBI agent undercover

22:35.054 --> 22:38.391
and saw the profile
of this guy, this...

22:39.358 --> 22:42.695
Alexander Frayne?

22:42.829 --> 22:45.297
This is sloppy.
I don't like it.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.933
Perhaps my assistant...
It doesn't matter.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.668
This is lazy.
It's unprofessional.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.837
I'm sorry
that this has shaken

22:50.970 --> 22:52.872
your confidence in us,
Mr. Stone.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.373
I do hope
you'll reconsider.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.810
Reconsider?
The job.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.179
You passed
with flying colors.

23:00.312 --> 23:03.315
If you'll have us, we'd like
to welcome you to Wellstone.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.088
Harold, please give me
good news.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.857
Agent Motjabai
got a name.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.059
Liz's interpreter
was Alexander Frayne.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.361
Uh, he works in DC for
the UN Human Rights Council.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.730
We've notified MPD.
Units are en route
to him now.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.169
This is Alexander.

23:23.302 --> 23:25.171
<i>Mr. Frayne,</i>
<i>you have a problem.</i>

23:25.304 --> 23:26.739
I got lots of them.
Who is this?

23:26.873 --> 23:29.175
Someone who can offer you
a way out.

23:29.308 --> 23:32.879
The FBI knows you moonlight
for the Wellstone Agency,

23:33.012 --> 23:35.347
<i>and the MPD are on their way</i>
<i>to arrest you.</i>

23:39.285 --> 23:40.352
They're here.
How did you know?

23:40.487 --> 23:41.888
Make your way
to Dupont Circle.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.690
You're looking for
a black Mercedes.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.892
<i>Northwest corner</i>
<i>of Connecticut Avenue.</i>

23:59.506 --> 24:00.439
Hello, Mr. Frayne.

24:00.573 --> 24:01.874
Who are you?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.243
Why are you helping me?

24:04.376 --> 24:06.513
Quid pro quo,
Alexander.

24:06.646 --> 24:09.015
You interpreted a meeting

24:09.148 --> 24:11.250
between this woman
and another party.

24:11.383 --> 24:14.420
I need to know who she met
and what they talked about.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.888
I can't help you.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.759
Let me rephrase.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.194
N-No, no. I...
Wait, I'm...

24:22.328 --> 24:24.096
I'm not saying
I won't help.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.999
I'm saying I can't.
I don't know who he was.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.301
You facilitated
their conversation.

24:29.435 --> 24:30.837
He was Bosnian.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.071
But they don't
give out names.

24:32.204 --> 24:35.441
Uh, she paid 700 grand
for a manilla envelope.

24:35.575 --> 24:36.643
I never saw
what was inside.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.110
Who has the names?

24:39.045 --> 24:40.713
The head of the company,
I guess?

24:40.847 --> 24:42.448
I don't even know
who that is.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.818
But if you send the right
message, he'll get it.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.820
Your contact at Wellstone.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.256
Call them.
Say you have a situation.

24:50.389 --> 24:53.125
Let them know
Raymond Reddington
wants to help.

25:11.911 --> 25:14.513
Jenna, nothing's
gonna happen to you.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.048
I promised you'd be okay.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.450
I said I'd take care of it,
and I will.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.126
<i>I just came to talk.</i>

25:27.259 --> 25:28.961
You sent men
to Jenna's apartment?

25:56.288 --> 25:59.025
You didn't have to do that.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.994
I told you
I just wanted to talk.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.470
Hey.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.573
It's Agent Park.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.509
Something's happened.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.011
I need your help.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.983
Hello?

26:24.116 --> 26:26.585
What the hell
did you do?

26:26.719 --> 26:29.221
Jorgensen?
They know. About us.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.190
<i>The company knows</i>
<i>there's a mole.</i>

26:31.323 --> 26:33.860
Uh, what, uh...
What are you talking about?

26:33.993 --> 26:35.962
They think
the FBI is onto them.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.130
I told you that
this was a mistake.

26:38.264 --> 26:42.401
<i>And now I got a target</i>
<i>on my back because of you.</i>

26:42.534 --> 26:44.671
I got to call you back.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.739
Is, uh, something wrong?

26:46.873 --> 26:48.374
I need you
to come with me.

26:48.507 --> 26:50.042
The Colonel would like
to see you.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.392
<i>** The air is still</i>

27:06.525 --> 27:09.161
Reddington. I told him we were
going to pick up Frayne,

27:09.295 --> 27:11.030
and now Frayne's gone because
Reddington got there first.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.331
<i>But we sent agents.</i>

27:12.464 --> 27:14.433
<i>Wellstone knows</i>
<i>someone outed Frayne.</i>

27:14.566 --> 27:15.768
<i>Aram.</i>
I already called him.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.837
<i>He's not picking up.</i>

27:17.970 --> 27:20.572
<i>** There's no turning back</i>

27:20.707 --> 27:22.241
Ah, finally.

27:22.374 --> 27:23.342
Oh.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.643
Uh, hello.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.448
The Colonel here
lost his hearing as a child.

27:29.581 --> 27:32.218
Nasty case of meningitis.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.788
Colonel? Uh,
the man who runs,
uh, Wellstone is deaf?

27:35.922 --> 27:38.357
Indeed. The head of a company
that provides translation

27:38.490 --> 27:40.092
needs a translator
to be understood.

27:40.226 --> 27:41.894
In this case, you.
So please sit.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.663
<i>** How long will it last?</i>

27:44.797 --> 27:48.300
<i>** How long?</i>

27:48.434 --> 27:51.337
<i>** How long will we run?</i>

27:51.470 --> 27:54.206
"You prevented the arrest
of one of my translators.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.309
"You had him inform
his contact that

27:57.443 --> 27:59.912
"there is a problem
in the company
that you could solve."

28:00.046 --> 28:02.014
Yes, you have a mole.

28:03.649 --> 28:06.285
Tell him he has a leak
that puts us both at risk.

28:09.021 --> 28:13.025
<i>** Don't know how we got here</i>

28:14.761 --> 28:16.095
"No. Impossible."

28:16.228 --> 28:18.497
It's why Mr. Frayne
was nearly pinched

28:18.630 --> 28:21.133
and why the FBI knew
where to find him.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.705
"There is no leak."

28:26.839 --> 28:29.876
Uh, there is a mole,
and he works for the FBI.

28:30.009 --> 28:33.880
He led them to Frayne,
which means he can
lead them to <i>you.</i>

28:34.013 --> 28:35.882
Now, you can be stubborn
about it

28:36.015 --> 28:38.517
and wait around for the feds
to show up,

28:38.650 --> 28:42.989
or you can do exactly as I say
and live happily ever after.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.994
"Do you know
who the mole is?"

28:48.127 --> 28:49.896
Yes.
He's a federal agent

28:50.029 --> 28:52.031
working undercover
as an interpreter.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.866
<i>** How long?</i>

28:54.000 --> 28:56.235
<i>** There's no turning back</i>

28:58.704 --> 28:59.839
"What do you
want me to do?"

28:59.972 --> 29:02.708
First, delete my file.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.044
Now.
Before the feds arrive.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.716
Second, in exchange
for giving you a way out,

29:10.850 --> 29:13.953
a new identity,
I want a name.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.389
Last week, a woman using
the name Carolyn Givens

29:17.523 --> 29:19.258
hired Wellstone.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.693
I want to know
who she met with.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.796
<i>** How long?</i>

29:23.930 --> 29:26.933
<i>** How long will we run? **</i>

29:44.683 --> 29:45.617
I can read.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.626
"Wait.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.929
"The mole.
I need his name."

29:57.063 --> 29:59.932
Why? It's over.
He won.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.267
Killing him won't
change the fact

30:01.400 --> 30:03.235
that you need to come
with me now.

30:12.111 --> 30:14.847
"I need to know a name.

30:14.981 --> 30:18.750
"If you don't give me one,
I'll kill him.

30:18.885 --> 30:21.453
"Either because
he's the mole

30:21.587 --> 30:25.091
"or to set an example
of what happens
when you betray me."

30:25.224 --> 30:28.427
Normally, I'm a big believer
in example setting,

30:28.560 --> 30:32.598
but I specifically requested
your newest interpreter

30:32.731 --> 30:37.436
because the leaks predate
his employment at Wellstone.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.972
He's not the mole.

30:40.106 --> 30:43.275
And we need to go. Now.

31:04.430 --> 31:07.299
<i>Okay, what do you mean</i>
<i>he recorded the conversation?</i>

31:07.433 --> 31:10.202
<i>Evidently, Reddington</i>
<i>was wearing a wire,</i>

31:10.336 --> 31:11.837
<i>one we'll tell</i>
<i>the Justice Department</i>

31:11.971 --> 31:13.239
<i>that you were wearing.</i>

31:13.372 --> 31:14.840
You think
we can make a case?

31:14.974 --> 31:16.675
I do.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.877
A lot of Wellstone
employees and clients
are going to prison.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.279
But not the owner.

31:20.412 --> 31:21.780
<i>Mr. Reddington</i>
<i>promised the Colonel</i>

31:21.914 --> 31:23.315
<i>that he'd help him escape</i>
<i>in exchange for the name</i>

31:23.449 --> 31:24.450
<i>of the person</i>
<i>that Liz met with.</i>

31:24.583 --> 31:25.817
<i>You didn't see</i>
<i>that person's name?</i>

31:25.952 --> 31:27.319
<i>Mr. Reddington</i>
<i>made sure I didn't.</i>

31:27.453 --> 31:29.821
Adin Markovic.
He's a Bosnian bounty hunter.

31:29.956 --> 31:32.024
Evidently, Keen
used Wellstone
to hire him.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.726
Mr. Reddington
told you the name? Why?

31:34.860 --> 31:36.162
Because we're
on the same team.

31:36.295 --> 31:37.729
And because he knows
we have to work together

31:37.863 --> 31:40.299
if we have any hope
of bringing Keen home safely.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.501
Adin Markovic,
this bounty hunter,

31:42.634 --> 31:44.670
we'll see what
we can find on him.

31:44.803 --> 31:47.439
Agent Park.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.675
I spoke with the AUSA.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.043
There's been a development
in the case

31:51.177 --> 31:52.311
involving
your friend's death.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.413
It appears
Dieterle is missing.

32:00.486 --> 32:01.753
Will you help?

32:04.023 --> 32:05.291
<i>Alina,</i>
<i>you promised me</i>

32:05.424 --> 32:08.160
you wouldn't do
anything to Dieterle.
I need to know.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.762
Did you break
that promise?

32:10.896 --> 32:12.264
No, sir.

32:21.974 --> 32:23.709
Mr. Cooper.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.577
Mr. Cooper, um,

32:25.711 --> 32:27.913
about, uh, this drive
you wanted me to decrypt.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.715
Uh, I can't.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.550
I reached out to a friend
at the NSA.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.385
Do you trust him?
I do.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.387
Good. Because if he
tells anyone about this,

32:35.521 --> 32:36.555
his life
could be in jeopardy.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.757
Keep me posted.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.292
Yes, sir.

32:52.038 --> 32:55.774
Raymond, you have
to tell Paula
he's not coming.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.210
Oh.

32:58.344 --> 33:01.947
He gets her hopes up,
and I have to be the one
to dash them.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.415
Glen at his finest.

33:05.551 --> 33:08.754
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:08.887 --> 33:10.556
You came!

33:10.689 --> 33:12.591
I brought the scotcher...

33:12.724 --> 33:15.227
Hello.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.763
Oh.
You must be Paula.

33:17.896 --> 33:21.633
Oh, Glen has told me so much
about you, but, oh, my gosh,

33:21.767 --> 33:23.435
you're even more beautiful
than he described.

33:23.569 --> 33:24.903
Oh!

33:27.573 --> 33:32.010
Glen, he was
one of the good ones.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.980
One of the unusual ones,
for sure, but...

33:35.114 --> 33:40.186
But, you know, that guy
could always brighten my day.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.488
You know,
I remember when we were
recording our third album,

33:42.621 --> 33:44.590
Johnny had written
this great progression

33:44.723 --> 33:47.393
and he had a little bit
of a melody,

33:47.526 --> 33:48.994
and it was up to me
to come up with the lyric,

33:49.128 --> 33:50.396
and I couldn't do it.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.798
I tried and tried,
and I was stuck.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.166
I just couldn't come up
with anything,

33:54.300 --> 33:56.202
and I remember Glen came over

33:56.335 --> 33:58.370
and we went out
for chili dogs, of course.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.674
And I just broke down
about this song.

34:02.808 --> 34:04.776
And I told him, you know,
"I don't know what to do.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.512
"This is super important.

34:06.645 --> 34:07.813
"If we don't have a hit
with this album,

34:07.946 --> 34:09.315
"the label's gonna drop us,"

34:09.448 --> 34:12.017
and Glen put his hand
on my arm

34:12.151 --> 34:14.386
and looked me dead in the eye,
and he said,

34:14.520 --> 34:18.023
"Hey, if this is it,
this is it."

34:20.526 --> 34:22.861
And, boom, there it was.

34:22.994 --> 34:26.265
I mean, that lyric
and that song.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.835
I mean, this is what Glen did.

34:29.968 --> 34:33.672
He, you know... He...
He was like a muse to me,

34:33.805 --> 34:35.174
and I loved him.

34:38.344 --> 34:40.912
But he wouldn't want us
bawling all over the place.

34:41.046 --> 34:42.881
He'd want us
to have a good time.

34:43.014 --> 34:45.251
Like Glen used to say,
"We're not here
for a long time.

34:45.384 --> 34:47.018
"We're here for
a good time," so...

34:48.154 --> 34:49.821
Raise a glass,

34:51.056 --> 34:54.426
or a chicken wing,
or whatever you got,

34:54.560 --> 34:59.231
'cause tonight
we celebrate my muse.

34:59.365 --> 35:04.570
Tonight,
we celebrate Jelly Bean
and his big, old heart.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.605
<i>(WE'RE NOT HERE FOR</i>
<i>A LONG TIME, WE'RE HERE</i>
<i>FOR A GOOD TIME</i> PLAYS)

35:20.986 --> 35:24.122
<i>** There's a party</i>
<i>down on the corner</i>

35:24.256 --> 35:25.791
<i>** Do you wanna go?</i>

35:28.427 --> 35:32.264
<i>** They got rhythm</i>
<i>a little blues</i>

35:32.398 --> 35:35.967
<i>** And a whole lot of soul</i>

35:36.101 --> 35:39.905
<i>** I don't care what</i>
<i>you've got to say</i>

35:40.038 --> 35:42.908
<i>** You're comin'</i>
<i>with me anyway</i>

35:43.041 --> 35:45.311
<i>** We're not here</i>
<i>for a long time **</i>

35:45.444 --> 35:47.379
What are you doing?
Oh, my goodness.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.448
I can't believe
you came.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.917
Thank you, thank you,
Mr. Lewis.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.752
Didn't hurt a bit.
What happened?

35:53.885 --> 35:55.120
What changed your mind?

35:55.254 --> 35:56.588
You did.

35:57.223 --> 35:58.990
Mr. Reddington.

35:59.124 --> 36:00.926
You spoke to Jerry.
Yeah.

36:01.059 --> 36:03.595
And I got to know 'cause
I can't get my head around it.

36:03.729 --> 36:06.532
Why in the world
is Raymond Reddington

36:06.665 --> 36:09.167
running errands
for a DMV desk clerk?

36:09.301 --> 36:10.602
Regional manager.

36:10.736 --> 36:14.340
Yeah, but why is this guy
so special

36:14.473 --> 36:16.742
that the world's
most wanted fugitive

36:16.875 --> 36:20.246
is arranging
his memorial service?

36:20.379 --> 36:22.147
People often
hide from me.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.550
Glen was good
at finding them.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.353
I-I didn't ask you
what he did.

36:27.486 --> 36:29.388
I asked
what made him special.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.156
That's a bit
more complicated.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.791
Ah, I'm sure it is.

36:32.924 --> 36:34.826
I'm sure it's
incredibly complicated.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.563
And weird and strange.

36:37.696 --> 36:41.367
But I like weird
and strange.
Ah.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.870
You said I could ask
for any favor,
that's the favor.

36:45.003 --> 36:48.974
You want me
to tell you about how weird
and strange Glen was.

36:49.107 --> 36:50.676
I want to hear
your eulogy.

36:50.809 --> 36:53.178
I want Raymond Reddington
to tell me

36:53.312 --> 36:56.982
what was weird
and strange and beautiful

36:57.115 --> 37:00.252
about the regional manager
of the Rockville DMV.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.354
You know who I am.

37:02.488 --> 37:04.590
You know I can do
some very big favors.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.693
Oh, trust me,
I thought about asking you

37:07.826 --> 37:10.061
to scare the bejesus out of
my pal Bruce Hornsby.

37:10.195 --> 37:12.998
That'd be good.

37:13.131 --> 37:15.967
Uh, but the truth is,
you can't do a bigger favor

37:16.101 --> 37:18.470
than revealing
somebody's heart and soul.

37:18.604 --> 37:19.838
No, I don't suppose
you can.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.340
Yeah, I did my part.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.241
I gave my eulogy,

37:23.375 --> 37:26.545
and in exchange,
I'd like to hear
your version.

37:29.348 --> 37:31.683
Mr. Lewis, big fan.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.352
Thanks.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.358
What... What is that?

37:39.491 --> 37:41.226
The remains
of a Great Dane.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.894
We're friends with a vet.

37:43.028 --> 37:44.396
He works at a shelter
where they cremate pets

37:44.530 --> 37:45.864
who have to be put down.

37:45.997 --> 37:48.033
But I told you I wasn't
gonna steal his ashes.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.768
And I know you well enough
to know that,

37:49.901 --> 37:51.837
in the end,
you probably would.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.440
I... I'm sorry,
but, uh, what's going on

37:54.573 --> 37:56.608
with all the beans
and the baggies
and the ashes?

37:56.742 --> 37:58.710
I'll explain everything
on the way.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.716
<i>** Have yourself a good time **</i>

38:23.769 --> 38:26.237
Okay.

38:26.372 --> 38:28.106
Here we are.

38:28.239 --> 38:30.709
Glen.
Right.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.744
Glen.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.250
Glen was...

38:42.588 --> 38:45.891
So many different things.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.259
A son.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.761
Civil servant.

38:51.463 --> 38:55.333
A proud member of
the Spare Me bowling team.

38:55.467 --> 39:01.807
Two-time runner-up at the
Southern Regional Tournament.

39:01.940 --> 39:07.345
And a great...
A truly great tracker.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.848
But he was...

39:09.981 --> 39:11.550
Ah, brother.

39:14.319 --> 39:16.087
He was a lot more than that.

39:18.824 --> 39:21.159
Glen was...

39:21.292 --> 39:23.929
Infuriating.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.297
Insulting.

39:26.432 --> 39:30.168
Just so maddening.

39:30.301 --> 39:35.006
He was a hedonist,
a chauvinist,
a liar, and a cheat,

39:35.140 --> 39:39.678
but there was one thing
Glen was not.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.885
And that's afraid.

39:47.018 --> 39:51.322
Glen was not afraid.

39:51.457 --> 39:53.459
He wasn't afraid of judgment.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.026
Of being wrong.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.695
He wasn't afraid
of friendship.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.497
Or romance.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.231
A bad joke.

40:00.365 --> 40:02.934
A good laugh.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.403
He was never afraid
of a good time.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.606
Or bad timing.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.375
Or consequences.

40:10.509 --> 40:13.945
Or of an impossible task.

40:14.079 --> 40:17.483
Or any kind of danger.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.820
And he certainly
wasn't afraid of me.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.522
Ever.

40:25.991 --> 40:32.631
No matter how hard
or unfair life was to Glen,

40:32.764 --> 40:36.602
Glen loved life back.

40:36.735 --> 40:43.542
He embraced it without
reservation, regret,
or remorse.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.877
And that is...

40:49.314 --> 40:50.115
Rare.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.727
I wish...

41:04.730 --> 41:08.667
I wish more people
were unafraid like Glen.

41:12.638 --> 41:16.141
It's the thing about him
I'll miss the most.

41:24.049 --> 41:29.120
And I hope it'll be
some time before

41:33.592 --> 41:35.927
all my memories of him

41:40.165 --> 41:41.933
start to fade.
