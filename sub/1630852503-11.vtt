00:04.137 --> 00:05.572
<i>Previously on</i> Good Sam...

00:05.638 --> 00:07.507
{\an5}Trauma still chasing you?

00:05.638 --> 00:07.507
Actually,

00:07.574 --> 00:09.676
the ER will be my home base.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.511
{\an5}Malcolm?

00:09.743 --> 00:11.511
CALEB: If you can't
get serious with me

00:11.578 --> 00:13.146
{\an3}because you still
have feelings for him,

00:13.213 --> 00:14.447
I just need to know.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.649
Casual's just where
I am right now.

00:16.716 --> 00:19.152
{\an5}I slept with someone else.

00:16.716 --> 00:19.152
What?

00:19.219 --> 00:21.020
(gasps)

00:19.219 --> 00:21.020
I know what you did.

00:21.087 --> 00:22.355
Stealing my surgery.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.757
I didn't steal your surgery.

00:23.823 --> 00:26.292
When I was a kid,
he was driving, I got hurt,

00:26.359 --> 00:27.260
I had to have surgery.

00:27.327 --> 00:30.430
{\an1}The reason he didn't
come into the ER that day

00:30.497 --> 00:32.698
is because I wouldn't let him.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.200
I was drunk.

00:34.267 --> 00:36.703
{\an5}Dad, I love you.

00:34.267 --> 00:36.703
I love you, too.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.272
Rob Griffith shouldn't be a part
of this hospital at all.

00:39.339 --> 00:41.674
{\an3}There's the truth.
You decide whose place

00:41.741 --> 00:43.543
it is to do something about it.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.816
(sighs)

00:49.883 --> 00:53.086
New baby, new baby, new hip.

00:53.153 --> 00:56.156
How are there no cards that
just say "congratulations"?

00:56.222 --> 00:58.158
{\an3}I've never seen
so many dangling cats.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.093
{\an3}It's like a whole
greeting card subgenre.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.362
{\an1}My dad is getting
his credentials back today.

01:02.429 --> 01:04.364
{\an1}We cannot give him
a dangling cat.

01:04.431 --> 01:06.132
We go from...

01:06.199 --> 01:08.701
cataracts to colonoscopies

01:08.768 --> 01:11.271
to condolences.
Nothing we can use.

01:11.337 --> 01:13.139
{\an3}Oh, I could use
condolences

01:13.206 --> 01:14.441
{\an3}for the death
of my relationship.

01:14.507 --> 01:17.210
{\an1}Joey, I'm sorry.
Have you talked to Tim yet?

01:17.277 --> 01:19.846
{\an3}(scoffs) Does "You're sleeping
on the couch" count?

01:19.913 --> 01:23.516
{\an3}Distract me. What did a happy
couple do this morning?

01:23.583 --> 01:26.119
{\an1}Well... we're not really
a "couple."

01:26.186 --> 01:27.487
{\an5}Exactly.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.487
Oh, right,

01:27.554 --> 01:28.822
{\an5}you're "keeping it casual."

01:27.554 --> 01:28.822
Yeah.

01:28.888 --> 01:30.323
{\an1}Right. I mean, labels
just complicate things.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.425
{\an3}Mm-hmm. So does
cheating on someone

01:32.492 --> 01:34.160
{\an3}right before you
agree to marry them.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.229
{\an6}Hey, Joey?

01:34.227 --> 01:36.229
JOEY: Mm-hmm?

01:36.296 --> 01:37.597
{\an8}CALEB:
Hang in there.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.466
SAM: Guys, come on,
anything for my dad?

01:39.532 --> 01:42.302
{\an7}Hey, what about this?
"Wishing you a speedy recovery."

01:42.368 --> 01:44.103
What is he recovering from?

01:44.170 --> 01:45.538
Not being the boss?

01:46.706 --> 01:48.274
{\an1}Sold.

01:48.341 --> 01:51.811
{\an5}Day two in the ER. Mm.

01:48.341 --> 01:51.811
Mm-hmm.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.513
Looking forward to it?

01:53.580 --> 01:56.816
I like it down there. I just
don't like being the rookie.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.718
Oh. Oh.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.718
Oh.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.253
Keep your head down.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.222
{\an3}Pay your dues.
You'll hit your stride.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.190
{\an1}You're right.
Hey, who knows,

02:04.257 --> 02:05.792
{\an3}maybe I'll graduate
to chicken pox today.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.293
That's the spirit.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.293
(chuckles)

02:07.360 --> 02:09.262
{\an5}(cell phone buzzes)

02:07.360 --> 02:09.262
Oh.

02:09.329 --> 02:12.165
{\an1}Getting called
to the principal's office.

02:13.933 --> 02:17.570
(inhales sharply)
Okay, well, I, um...

02:17.637 --> 02:20.306
It's so weird to think I'm not
gonna see you until tonight.

02:20.373 --> 02:23.243
You never know, an acute
myocardial infarction

02:23.309 --> 02:25.578
{\an5}might bring us together sooner
than you think.
Mm.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.181
Keep talking dirty to me.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.217
Bye.

02:32.552 --> 02:35.455
{\an1}The selection was better
with balloons.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.192
My dad's gonna love these.

02:39.259 --> 02:40.426
They aren't for him.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.495
{\an1}Getting your dad
through this proctorship

02:42.562 --> 02:44.564
was not easy, and you're leaving
the department

02:44.631 --> 02:46.165
better than you found it.

02:46.232 --> 02:47.467
Thanks, Caleb.

02:47.534 --> 02:48.768
Things were really
good around here,

02:48.835 --> 02:50.703
{\an5}weren't they?

02:48.835 --> 02:50.703
Yeah, they were.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.472
Well, until I found out
that my fiancé

02:52.539 --> 02:53.840
is a cheating,
lying snake, anyway.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.341
{\an3}ISAN:
Sucks, doesn't it?

02:55.408 --> 02:56.910
{\an1}When someone you
should be able to trust

02:56.976 --> 02:58.778
{\an1}turns out to be
a backstabbing parasite

02:58.845 --> 03:01.381
who sabotages coworkers
and steals their surgeries.

03:01.447 --> 03:03.616
{\an5}Isan, come on.

03:01.447 --> 03:03.616
What? You're taking his side?

03:03.683 --> 03:05.351
{\an5}I'm not taking sides.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.351
{\an1}You assigned
the surgery to me.

03:05.418 --> 03:06.653
{\an5}He stole it.

03:05.418 --> 03:06.653
(cell phone ringing)

03:06.719 --> 03:08.421
{\an3}All I did was tell the truth.
Your patient died on the table.

03:08.488 --> 03:09.689
{\an3}It's a fact.
He's the one who threw

03:09.756 --> 03:10.957
{\an3}a cake tantrum
in the worship room.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.425
Would you mind? Okay.

03:12.492 --> 03:13.793
I need to take this.
Will you start rounds

03:13.860 --> 03:16.362
without me, please?
And the two of you,

03:16.429 --> 03:18.631
we have a living donor
lung transplant today.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.934
Please put your differences
aside and focus on the patient.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.535
(cell phone continues ringing)

03:22.602 --> 03:24.237
{\an1}JOEY: I'll be sending you
the dry cleaning bill

03:24.304 --> 03:25.705
for the cake
on my shoes.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.877
He dry-cleans his shoes?

03:32.312 --> 03:33.846
I received your summons.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.215
{\an5}Am I in trouble?

03:33.913 --> 03:36.215
PYNE: On the contrary.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.888
{\an1}Thank you,
Dr. Pyne.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.756
{\an1}My pleasure,
Dr. Katz.

03:43.823 --> 03:46.225
What's this, some kind
of weird foreplay thing

03:46.292 --> 03:48.394
{\an5}you got going on because...

03:46.292 --> 03:48.394
I have been reviewing

03:48.461 --> 03:50.496
the requirements for your
proctorship this morning.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.931
In particular,
the surgical steps

03:51.998 --> 03:54.267
{\an3}that must be performed
successfully,

03:54.334 --> 03:55.768
and it's a long list.

03:55.835 --> 03:57.637
{\an1}I have been doing surgeries,
a lot of them.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.005
{\an1}Not as primary,
but...

03:59.072 --> 04:01.507
Being primary is not
one of the requirements.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.709
What?

04:02.775 --> 04:03.977
{\an3}It was a surprise
to me, too,

04:04.043 --> 04:05.845
{\an3}but the guidelines
are clear.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.947
If you have done the surgery,
you've met the requirement,

04:08.014 --> 04:09.649
whether you were primary or not.

04:09.716 --> 04:11.551
{\an3}And now that
Dr. Pyne

04:11.618 --> 04:12.919
{\an3}has submitted
your recommendation

04:12.986 --> 04:15.321
for return to surgery
without restriction...

04:15.388 --> 04:17.824
It's over? Is that what
you're telling me?

04:17.890 --> 04:20.526
{\an5}It's over.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.526
Congratulations, Doctor.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.395
I'm back in surgery?

04:22.462 --> 04:24.464
As soon as you walk
out the door.

04:24.530 --> 04:25.665
Okay.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.033
Okay? That's all
you're gonna say?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.935
Your proctorship is over.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.371
If you were expecting
a happy dance,

04:31.437 --> 04:33.973
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
I should get to work.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.009

05:21.587 --> 05:22.955
{\an7}that you wanted
to talk in person?

05:23.022 --> 05:24.924
{\an8}(door closes)

05:23.022 --> 05:24.924
{\an8}ETOH.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.560
{\an8}What?

05:24.991 --> 05:27.560
{\an9}Uh, medical shorthand
for ethyl alcohol.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.395
{\an8}No, I-I know what it is.
Why are you...

05:29.462 --> 05:31.464
{\an9}Uh, paramedics use it in their
field reports to describe

05:31.531 --> 05:33.666
{\an8}intoxicated subjects.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.735
{\an8}Look, my mom found

05:35.802 --> 05:39.072
{\an9}a field report from the accident
when you were a kid.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.341
{\an9}It says your dad was
drunk that night.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.643
{\an8}That he was...

05:43.710 --> 05:45.778
{\an8}ETOH. I know.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.380
{\an8}You do?

05:47.447 --> 05:48.915
{\an8}Yeah.

05:48.981 --> 05:50.950
{\an8}My mom took
the report.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.953
{\an8}She's been hiding it.
Not well, apparently.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.689
{\an8}How long have you known?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.689
{\an8}Couple of weeks.

05:56.756 --> 05:59.492
{\an8}This is the personal thing

05:59.559 --> 06:01.060
{\an8}that I told you
he's been dealing with.

06:01.127 --> 06:02.929
{\an8}Sounds like you've been
dealing with it, too.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.064
{\an8}Look, I...

06:05.131 --> 06:06.966
{\an8}I wish I would've known.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.966
{\an8}It's okay.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.136
{\an8}But...

06:10.203 --> 06:13.372
{\an8}I actually thought we were
starting to put this behind us.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.576
{\an8}My mom's not gonna

06:14.173 --> 06:16.576
{\an8}let that happen.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.716
{\an8}Hey, you came back.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.485
{\an8}You didn't think I would?

06:23.783 --> 06:25.485
{\an8}Oh, I thought maybe

06:25.551 --> 06:26.753
{\an8}all the scut work
and night shifts

06:26.819 --> 06:28.020
{\an8}might make you reconsider
leaving CT.

06:28.087 --> 06:29.655
{\an8}I don't scare
that easily.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.624
{\an8}Good, 'cause you're about to do
your first shift

06:31.691 --> 06:32.925
{\an8}with the big boss man.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.661
{\an7}Vega? Okay, what can y'all
tell me about him?

06:37.964 --> 06:39.632
{\an8}Don't ask him how
his weekend was.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.501
{\an8}He doesn't like small talk.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.501
{\an8}Okay.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.602
{\an8}Or feelings.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.036
{\an7}He doesn't
like feelings?

06:44.103 --> 06:45.171
{\an9}He doesn't like talking
about his feelings.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.440
{\an8}He considers them a distraction.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.942
{\an8}He does not like
distraction.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.942
{\an8}Or drama.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.779
{\an7}Okay, no distractions, no drama,
no small talk. Got it.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.580
{\an7}Anything else
I should know about

06:54.647 --> 06:56.115
{\an8}the great and powerful
Nicholas Vega?

06:56.182 --> 06:57.617
{\an7}Just that he's
right behind you.

06:57.683 --> 06:59.719
{\an7}Tell radiology to repeat
this MRA, would you?

06:59.786 --> 07:01.621
{\an7}And have Dr. Lieberman call us
about the Lyme disease case.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.422
{\an8}Dr. Vega, Lex Trulie.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.422
{\an8}What's she doing?

07:03.489 --> 07:04.724
{\an8}Introducing herself.

07:03.489 --> 07:04.724
{\an8}Why?

07:04.791 --> 07:06.058
{\an9}Well, it's a custom
when two people

07:06.125 --> 07:07.426
{\an9}who don't know each
other first meet.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.861
{\an8}(siren wailing)

07:08.928 --> 07:10.530
{\an7}VEGA:
You're joining my department?

07:10.596 --> 07:11.964
{\an9}Yes. I was a medic
in the Air...

07:12.031 --> 07:13.132
{\an7}Better stop talking
and start moving

07:13.199 --> 07:15.101
{\an8}if you're gonna
keep up in here.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.769
{\an8}Johnny Dean, 54.
Blunt facial trauma

07:16.836 --> 07:19.005
{\an9}secondary to
mechanical fall.

07:19.071 --> 07:20.873
{\an9}There's severe edema
surrounding the eyeball.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.642
{\an8}Johnny, how are you?
My name is Dr. Vega.

07:22.708 --> 07:23.442
{\an8}Do you mind if
I take a look?

07:23.509 --> 07:25.144
{\an8}No, it's okay.

07:25.211 --> 07:28.114
{\an8}Ouch. Look straight ahead.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.583
{\an8}Can you close your eyes?

07:31.951 --> 07:33.820
{\an8}IOP's at least 40. We need
to relieve this pressure.

07:33.886 --> 07:34.754
{\an8}On it.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.689
{\an8}Lido, two percent
with topical tetracaine.

07:36.756 --> 07:37.924
{\an8}Thank you.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.560
{\an7}Little sting.
Stay still.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.461
{\an8}Forming a lateral
canthotomy to get

07:42.528 --> 07:43.896
{\an7}the blood flow
back to the eye.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.698
{\an8}Uh, shouldn't we check
for pupil irregularity

07:45.765 --> 07:47.466
{\an8}or a prolapsed iris?

07:45.765 --> 07:47.466
{\an7}I already did that
when I assessed

07:47.533 --> 07:49.135
{\an8}his intraocular pressure.
If this ER moved at your pace,

07:49.202 --> 07:51.737
{\an8}this man may have
already lost his vision.

07:51.804 --> 07:55.007
{\an9}Just breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.810
{\an8}SAM: <i> Have you heard</i>
<i>from Tina Kingsley?</i>

07:55.074 --> 07:57.810
{\an5}GRIFF: <i> What?</i>

07:57.877 --> 07:59.712
{\an8}She has the accident report.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.914
{\an8}What if she uses it to block
your reinstatement?

08:01.981 --> 08:03.149
{\an8}She's been looking for a reason

08:03.216 --> 08:04.750
{\an8}to get rid of me
since she got here.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.252
{\an8}Well, we gave her one.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.788
{\an8}I'll talk to her.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.858
{\an8}(indistinct chatter)

08:11.924 --> 08:13.092
{\an8}(laughter)

08:13.159 --> 08:14.193
{\an8}Hi, Chloe.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.162
{\an9}Hi, Sam.
Hey, Griff.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.563
Hey.

08:17.630 --> 08:18.831
So, how are you
feeling, Chloe?

08:18.898 --> 08:21.634
{\an3}Finally getting
a lung transplant,

08:21.701 --> 08:23.769
or a lobe, anyway.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.538
It's the best day of my life.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.540
{\an3}You've been waiting
a long time for this.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.075
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.075
CHLOE: I'd still be waiting

08:29.141 --> 08:30.176
if it wasn't for Yolanda.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.711
{\an6}SAM: Okay.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.711
GRIFF: So...

08:31.777 --> 08:34.280
{\an1}Let's check vitals
and order pre-op labs

08:34.347 --> 08:36.215
on both patients, please.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.085
So, you two, uh,
grew up together?

08:39.150 --> 08:41.220
Uh, yeah. We were
next-door neighbors.

08:41.287 --> 08:42.855
Our bedroom windows
faced each other.

08:42.922 --> 08:45.191
{\an4}CHLOE:
As my cystic fibrosis
got worse,

08:45.258 --> 08:46.959
I couldn't do normal things,

08:47.026 --> 08:48.961
like school, parties.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.097
Mm-hmm.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.097
If I ever felt lonely,

08:51.163 --> 08:53.633
I just looked out my window,

08:53.699 --> 08:55.134
and Yoli was
always there.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.903
{\an1}YOLANDA: When I realized
how bad her lungs had gotten,

08:56.969 --> 08:59.538
I told her, "If I'm a match,
we're doing this."

08:59.605 --> 09:00.806
{\an3}CALEB:
And here you are.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.174
How soon can we do it?

09:02.241 --> 09:05.578
{\an1}I'd...
say that depends.

09:05.645 --> 09:06.779
On what?

09:06.846 --> 09:09.015
{\an1}On whatever's causing
Yolanda's fever.

09:09.081 --> 09:11.017
{\an5}(thermometer beeps)

09:09.081 --> 09:11.017
It's 102.2.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.184
{\an1}(grunts)

09:12.251 --> 09:13.653
I haven't been feeling great,

09:13.719 --> 09:15.221
but I thought
it was just nerves.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.790
Yolanda, we can't take you
into the OR with a fever,

09:17.857 --> 09:19.325
so we're gonna need
to run some tests...

09:19.392 --> 09:20.893
{\an1}You're saying the surgery's
not gonna happen.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.861
{\an3}SAM:
No. No, Chloe.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.764
{\an3}I'm just saying it's not
gonna happen today.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.801
Hang in there.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.774
Hey.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.275
What you doing up here?

09:36.342 --> 09:39.278
(sighs) Trying to get out
of a hole I dug for myself

09:39.345 --> 09:41.314
with my new boss. You?

09:41.380 --> 09:44.317
Uh, wishing Tina Kingsley
would fall into a hole.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.686
She's still coming for you?

09:49.789 --> 09:50.990
Come here.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.660
{\an1}(sighs)

09:54.727 --> 09:57.797
{\an5}You completed your
proctorship today.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.797
Mm-hmm.

09:57.863 --> 10:00.333
That's huge.

09:57.863 --> 10:00.333
Right.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.368
You should celebrate. Don't
let her rain on your parade.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.270
You're right, you're right.
Thank you.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.739
So, what'd you do
to get down in a hole?

10:06.806 --> 10:09.642
Vega thinks I'm too big
for my britches.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.711
{\an5}Nicholas Vega?

10:09.709 --> 10:11.711
Mm-hmm.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.913
{\an1}Isn't that the pot
calling the kettle...

10:13.980 --> 10:16.349
a pot.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.349
(chuckles)

10:16.415 --> 10:19.185
He's right, actually.

10:19.251 --> 10:22.388
I overstepped.
Forgot I was the new kid.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.256
I know there's a pecking order.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.726
Yeah. He'll be the head pecker,
all right.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.361
{\an3}(laughs)

10:32.198 --> 10:33.699
{\an1}Trash-talking me
to another patient?

10:33.766 --> 10:34.867
{\an3}Running bloodwork,
actually,

10:34.934 --> 10:36.235
which you should know

10:36.302 --> 10:37.636
{\an3}because Sam wants
all of us on this one.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.939
I'll get on when you get off.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.140
I'm not getting off.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.274
Well, I'm not working with you

10:42.341 --> 10:43.743
until you answer
for what you did.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.111
Sam's not gonna come
to your rescue

10:45.177 --> 10:46.846
on this one because,
deep down, she knows

10:46.912 --> 10:48.814
you shouldn't have gotten
that surgery in the first place.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.316
I did her a favor by taking it.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.184
Oh, so you admit you stole it.

10:52.251 --> 10:55.988
{\an3}(sighs) The patient
changed her mind.

10:56.055 --> 10:57.857
{\an1}Because you poisoned her
against me.

10:57.923 --> 10:59.925
{\an3}I'm not gonna lose
any more surgeries to you.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.394
Everyone's looking for an edge.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.863
{\an1}Well, then step up your game
instead of sabotaging me.

11:03.929 --> 11:05.865
{\an3}I didn't sabotage you.
I told the truth.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.867
{\an3}If you don't like people to know
that you're killing patients,

11:07.933 --> 11:09.035
try not killing your patients.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.971
I didn't kill anyone!

11:12.038 --> 11:13.739
{\an5}All right, don't...

11:12.038 --> 11:13.739
Hey. Hey!

11:13.806 --> 11:15.975
Stop it! Stop it!

11:16.042 --> 11:18.911
What is the matter with you?
There are patients

11:18.978 --> 11:20.079
around the corner.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.347
The two of you should

11:21.414 --> 11:22.748
{\an5}be working together.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.748
No, not with him.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.216
{\an1}You got to pick
one of us.

11:24.283 --> 11:25.918
It's him or me.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.353
I have already lost Lex
to Trauma.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.221
I am not going to be
understaffed

11:29.288 --> 11:30.456
on a complex surgery

11:30.523 --> 11:32.792
{\an1}because the two of you
have issues.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.394
You're both
on the lung transplant.

11:35.461 --> 11:38.264
Get it together and get to work.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.706
{\an5}Beautiful.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.706
Uh, can we talk?

11:47.773 --> 11:50.076
{\an1}Uh, yeah, if you talk fast.
I'm headed to a meeting.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.778
{\an1}All right, look,
whatever our differences,

11:52.845 --> 11:56.015
or whatever I've done
to incur your wrath,

11:56.082 --> 11:58.150
{\an1}going public
with this report,

11:58.217 --> 12:00.119
{\an1}dragging my reputation
through the mud,

12:00.186 --> 12:01.720
won't solve anything.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.222
I don't want
to go public.

12:03.289 --> 12:06.025
{\an5}You don't?

12:03.289 --> 12:06.025
No. I just want you out.

12:06.092 --> 12:08.461
Step down, Griff,
once and for all,

12:08.527 --> 12:10.262
{\an3}and I'll forget
I ever saw that report.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.465
{\an5}If I don't?

12:10.329 --> 12:12.465
Well, this will end you.

12:12.531 --> 12:14.900
{\an3}Not just here, but wherever
you sought work,

12:14.967 --> 12:16.168
and that's assuming
you aren't stripped

12:16.235 --> 12:17.837
{\an3}of your credentials
along the way.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.806
{\an3}Doing this quietly is
so much better for you.

12:20.873 --> 12:23.876
{\an1}Okay, and why is it
better for you?

12:23.943 --> 12:26.245
{\an3}The last thing I need
is a scandal.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.781
Might interfere
with the sale.

12:31.183 --> 12:33.919
{\an1}What do you mean Tina Kingsley's
not taking the report public?

12:33.986 --> 12:35.221
She still wants me to leave.

12:35.287 --> 12:36.789
She just wants me
to leave quietly.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.458
{\an5}Why does that matter?

12:36.856 --> 12:39.458
Because of them.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.427
This is all Brazilian acacia,
by the way.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.962
{\an1}It's a private
equity firm.

12:43.028 --> 12:45.231
What are they doing?

12:45.297 --> 12:47.399
{\an3}Shopping.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.268
She's selling
the hospital.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.778
St. Mary's says to fax

12:59.845 --> 13:01.380
{\an3}employment inquiries
to this number.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.183
Donna, do you know
how to send a fax?

13:04.250 --> 13:05.551
I do.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.153
{\an1}CALEB: Just because
the hospital's for sale,

13:07.219 --> 13:08.454
{\an3}there's no need
to panic.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.555
Yeah, if they
don't tear the place down

13:09.622 --> 13:10.723
and build condos.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.025
Apparently, this equity firm
is known for cost cutting.

13:13.092 --> 13:14.293
Another word for layoffs.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.061
Good luck finding a job

13:16.128 --> 13:17.396
somewhere else
with your track record.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.833
{\an1}Okay, everyone.
I know you have questions,

13:20.900 --> 13:22.368
{\an1}and I am sure
the administration

13:22.434 --> 13:25.304
will have answers
about this potential sale soon,

13:25.371 --> 13:27.173
but right now that's all it is.

13:27.239 --> 13:28.841
It's potential.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.509
{\an3}And what's very real are
the patients entrusted

13:30.576 --> 13:33.445
to our care today, so let's
put our focus on them, hmm?

13:33.512 --> 13:36.115
{\an3}Wait, Donna, is
this your résumé?

13:36.182 --> 13:38.083
They come for the nurses first.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.785
{\an5}Donna.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.785
(pager beeping)

13:42.922 --> 13:44.356
(monitor beeping rapidly)

13:44.423 --> 13:46.325
Arterial oxygen's at 50.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.260
{\an5}Acute hypoxemia.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.260
(wheezing): I can't breathe.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.162
I know. Don't worry.
We're gonna help you.

13:50.229 --> 13:52.264
{\an5}Oxygen stats still plummeting.

13:50.229 --> 13:52.264
We're gonna have to intubate.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.134
{\an5}No. No.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.134
It's gonna keep you alive.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.036
When people like me
go on those things,

13:57.102 --> 13:58.204
they don't come off.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.538
Most people like you

13:59.605 --> 14:01.373
don't have a lung donor
in the next room.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.143
Did you... did you figure out
what's wrong with Yolanda?

14:04.210 --> 14:06.145
{\an1}ISAN:
It's gonna be okay, Chloe.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.113
(Chloe crying)

14:08.180 --> 14:10.849
{\an5}(thermometer beeps)

14:08.180 --> 14:10.849
Has my fever come down?

14:10.916 --> 14:13.852
Yes. Now it's
too far down.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.087
{\an1}94.8.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.589
She's hypothermic.

14:16.655 --> 14:19.458
{\an1}Let's get a Bair Hugger
and warm IV fluids right away.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.460
I ruined Chloe's surgery.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.395
You didn't ruin anything.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.231
We are gonna get
your core temp up

14:25.297 --> 14:27.266
and go from there.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.368
There we go.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.368
(shuddering)

14:41.981 --> 14:43.916
Um...

14:43.983 --> 14:46.151
Look, I-I was just about to send
the financial reports

14:46.218 --> 14:47.519
over to your office.

14:49.255 --> 14:51.557
I haven't seen you
around Lakeshore since...

14:51.624 --> 14:53.559
You told me you don't need me
here bossing you around.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.395
I assumed you weren't
speaking to me.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.497
Thought the same thing.

15:02.434 --> 15:05.504
I guess we can thank this sale
for clearing that up for us.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.340
You have any idea why
these buyers are so motivated?

15:08.407 --> 15:10.409
{\an3}Maybe they see
a big profit upside.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.578
I don't see how.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.380
Not without
a massive restructure.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.615
Well, they want
to close it fast.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.652
They've waived every
contingency, except for one.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.654
Let me see that.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.925
{\an5}(sighs)

15:24.423 --> 15:26.925
(door opens)

15:26.992 --> 15:30.062
Mystery solved.
I know why Tina wants me out.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.231
{\an1}Your propensity for ruining
private moments?

15:32.298 --> 15:34.633
Cardiothoracic surgeon
Dr. Jack Hendricks.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.602
And who is cardiothoracic
surgeon Dr. Jack Hendricks?

15:36.669 --> 15:38.203
Exactly.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.205
According to Byron,
this whole sale hinges

15:40.272 --> 15:42.007
on this nobody being instated

15:42.074 --> 15:43.575
as head of Lakeshore's
CT department.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.145
Why would Tina want
to replace you with an unknown?

15:46.211 --> 15:48.280
Because she's my nemesis.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.449
{\an1}You know, Griff, most people
don't have a nemesis.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.618
{\an3}It's usually a little more
nuanced than that.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.154
{\an1}Is it possible you have a part
to play in this conflict?

15:55.220 --> 15:57.356
Don't shrink me right now, Pyne.
You're off the clock.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.459
{\an3}He is, which is why we were
enjoying a rare moment

16:00.526 --> 16:04.029
of each other's company in the
peace and quiet of his office.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.531
Great. I'll use yours.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.433
{\an3}I got to dig up as much dirt
on this quack as I can.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.435
Is that hummus?

16:10.636 --> 16:12.171
{\an3}That's very,
very good.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.540
Little too much lemon, maybe.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.375
(door opens)

16:16.442 --> 16:18.344
{\an1}And you're just gonna let him
keep doing this?

16:18.410 --> 16:20.079
(door closes)

16:25.117 --> 16:27.286
{\an3}Yolanda Harris's core body
temperature is back up.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.587
Ah.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.587
That's a good sign.

16:28.654 --> 16:32.458
{\an1}Yeah, but fever
followed by hypotension

16:32.524 --> 16:34.259
{\an1}could be an indicator
of septic shock.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.627
{\an1}There have to be
risk factors

16:35.694 --> 16:37.162
{\an1}that we're not taking
into account.

16:37.229 --> 16:38.330
I want to talk to her.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.065
Hmm.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.736
You have something else
you want to tell me?

16:43.802 --> 16:45.637
{\an3}(chuckles) So, you know how
some of the residents

16:45.704 --> 16:48.107
{\an5}are sending out their résumés?

16:45.704 --> 16:48.107
Uh-huh.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.174
You, too?

16:49.241 --> 16:50.509
No, but...

16:50.576 --> 16:52.478
my friend in Boston
caught wind of the sale

16:52.544 --> 16:55.581
and had a recruiter from Harbor
Memorial Hospital reach out.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.583
Harbor Memorial. Wow.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.518
In Boston.

16:59.585 --> 17:02.421
But, you know, they're just
asking the question.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.223
Well, they're one of the best,

17:04.289 --> 17:06.458
so I'm not surprised
they called you.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.361
Must be nice
to be wanted.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.130
Uh, Sam. Hey.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.765
I've been looking for you.
Got a sec?

17:12.830 --> 17:15.501
{\an1}We're in the middle
of a personal conversation.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.637
{\an5}I'll talk to you later.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.637
Okay.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.782
How's Chloe?

17:29.848 --> 17:34.153
She is fighting
as hard as you are.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.789
Yolanda, have you traveled
anywhere unusual lately?

17:36.855 --> 17:40.092
{\an1}Your temperature fluctuations
could be caused by an infection.

17:40.159 --> 17:42.194
If we can narrow down to where
you might've picked it up...

17:42.261 --> 17:44.496
{\an5}I haven't been anywhere.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.496
What about crowds?

17:44.563 --> 17:46.331
Concerts, weddings?

17:46.398 --> 17:48.133
Anywhere where you might've been
exposed to someone who was sick?

17:48.200 --> 17:49.401
{\an3}When I found out that
I was a match for Chloe,

17:49.468 --> 17:51.537
my roommates
threw a party for me.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.739
{\an3}I ended up
making out

17:53.806 --> 17:55.274
with some guy
that I didn't know.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.142
Maybe it was him?

17:57.209 --> 17:58.610
It could be.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.347
I didn't mean
to jeopardize everything.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.817
{\an3}I never wanted
to let Chloe d...

18:04.883 --> 18:07.653
{\an5}SAM: I-I know. Oh.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.653
(monitors beeping rapidly)

18:07.719 --> 18:09.855
Whoa, okay, all right.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.855
Okay.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.657
We need two milligrams
of IV lorazepam

18:11.723 --> 18:13.492
in here now.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.294
{\an3}All right, all right,
all right.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.095
The ophthalmologist says

18:17.162 --> 18:19.565
that your emergency lateral
canthotomy was impeccable.

18:19.631 --> 18:20.699
You should make a full recovery.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.135
{\an5}Thank you.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.135
Thank you.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.303
You're most welcome.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.609
{\an1}Vega made you fill out the
discharge paperwork, didn't he?

18:30.676 --> 18:31.844
Yep, but to be fair, his hands

18:31.910 --> 18:33.312
are busy patting himself
on the back.

18:44.590 --> 18:45.724
Hey.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.493
{\an1}What are you doing
down here, Joey?

18:47.559 --> 18:50.262
Oh, I'm just here to wish
one of my dearest friends

18:50.329 --> 18:52.664
{\an5}a happy first day.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.664
It's my second day,

18:52.731 --> 18:54.233
we're not that dear,

18:54.299 --> 18:56.301
and you're down here
looking for your fiancé.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.803
Have you seen him?
Has he been around?

18:57.870 --> 18:59.738
Yeah. Working.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.673
Oh.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.175
Okay.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.478
{\an1}I heard
the wedding's off.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.347
Did you hear why?

19:06.545 --> 19:08.347
Yes.

19:08.413 --> 19:10.282
{\an3}How am I supposed to trust
anything he says?

19:10.349 --> 19:11.917
You know, this morning,
he went out for a jog.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.586
{\an3}I snuck out and followed him
on an electric scooter.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.888
{\an3}I almost died in a collision
with a garden gnome.

19:15.954 --> 19:17.890
{\an1}Okay, obsessing over
his whereabouts

19:17.956 --> 19:19.758
isn't good for you, Joey,

19:19.825 --> 19:21.927
{\an5}or the garden gnome.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.927
(siren wails, tires screech)

19:21.994 --> 19:24.796
{\an1}SUSAN:
Somebody help!

19:24.863 --> 19:27.499
Johnny! Johnny!

19:27.566 --> 19:28.700
We were just going to the car.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.269
{\an1}The ambulance came.
I turned around,

19:30.335 --> 19:31.637
{\an5}and he'd collapsed. Johnny.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.637
Mr. Dean, are you okay?

19:31.703 --> 19:33.539
{\an5}I...

19:31.703 --> 19:33.539
Back up, back up.

19:33.605 --> 19:34.673
I-I don't know. I don't know.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.341
Eric, let's bring him inside.

19:36.408 --> 19:37.609
{\an5}Yep.

19:36.408 --> 19:37.609
Oh, God. Johnny.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.777
{\an5}Here we go. I got you.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.777
Johnny.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.312
You discharged him.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.880
This is on you.

19:42.948 --> 19:45.350
Happy second day.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.461
{\an3}VEGA:
Let's do a pronator drift test.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.230
Can you tell me again
how you hurt your eye?

19:58.297 --> 20:00.198
{\an3}H-He fell. The
grandkids were over,

20:00.265 --> 20:02.868
{\an3}and I assumed he tripped
over one of the baby's toys.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.303
You stand up suddenly?

20:04.369 --> 20:06.371
I really don't remember.
Um, honey?

20:06.438 --> 20:08.774
{\an5}I-I didn't see it.

20:06.438 --> 20:08.774
{\an1}KACE:
You know, transient ischemia

20:08.840 --> 20:10.509
{\an5}could explain it.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.509
{\an1}LEX:
And his blood pressure's

20:10.576 --> 20:12.611
{\an1}been borderline.
Hypotension could be to blame.

20:12.678 --> 20:14.613
{\an4}Yeah, a lot of things
could be to blame.

20:12.678 --> 20:14.613
LEX: Wait, look at this.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.883
{\an5}Swelling around the ankles.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.883
That could be from the fall.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.651
Yeah, but it could also be
a symptom of heart disease.

20:19.718 --> 20:20.986
Let's do an MRI to confirm.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.454
Confirm what?
I-I thought he tripped.

20:22.521 --> 20:23.855
{\an1}KACE:
When it comes to falls,

20:23.922 --> 20:25.724
the-the cause
is a diagnosis of exclusion.

20:25.791 --> 20:28.327
We got to rule out everything
that didn't happen first.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.729
Let's get him to imaging.

20:30.796 --> 20:31.930
{\an1}Excuse me.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.365
(exhales)

20:37.736 --> 20:39.738
{\an1}Yolanda's blood pressure
is dropping,

20:39.805 --> 20:41.440
and her heart rate is frenetic.

20:41.506 --> 20:43.575
Her white blood cell count
suggests an infection,

20:43.642 --> 20:45.944
{\an5}but what kind?

20:43.642 --> 20:45.944
She said she made out
with a guy at a party.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.846
{\an1}Mono is common
among college kids.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.848
{\an5}And so is MRSA.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.848
But her oropharynx

20:49.915 --> 20:51.049
was clear
and her lymph nodes were normal.

20:51.116 --> 20:54.252
Have we spoken to her partner?
Is he exhibiting any symptoms?

20:54.319 --> 20:55.587
No, she didn't
get his number.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.289
{\an3}And are we sure
they just kissed?

20:57.356 --> 20:59.458
It could be chlamydia,
gonorrhea, syphilis.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.893
Can never be too careful
who you trust in your bed.

21:04.062 --> 21:06.531
Let's order an STI panel.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.333
What about meningitis?

21:08.400 --> 21:10.702
{\an1}Could be a possibility. We'll do
a lumbar puncture to confirm.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.270
{\an5}I'm on it.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.270
Okay.

21:12.337 --> 21:13.605
{\an1}Meningitis was my idea.
I'll do it.

21:13.672 --> 21:14.906
Well, I think Sam
just made her decision.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.375
I can't get through
a differential

21:16.441 --> 21:17.609
without the two of you
going at it?

21:17.676 --> 21:19.478
We have a patient
on a ventilator.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.780
It is too late for her
to get another donor,

21:21.847 --> 21:24.549
so if we do not figure out
what's going on with Yolanda,

21:24.616 --> 21:26.685
Chloe will never
come off that vent.

21:26.752 --> 21:30.489
{\an1}I want new labs run on her
by the time we finish the LP.

21:30.555 --> 21:32.391
Everybody move.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.328
{\an5}My God.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.328
{\an1}Are you really okay
with what he did?

21:36.395 --> 21:38.497
No, I'm not. But I don't
have time to get into it

21:38.563 --> 21:40.298
because we are working
and there is a lot going on.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.534
Yeah, like all of us
getting fired?

21:42.601 --> 21:44.336
{\an5}What?

21:42.601 --> 21:44.336
The rumor that
the new owners

21:44.403 --> 21:46.805
are gonna replace Griff
and cut the residency program?

21:46.872 --> 21:49.508
Is it true? Because
I don't look great

21:49.574 --> 21:52.077
{\an5}on paper right now,
and if I'm losing this job, I...

21:49.574 --> 21:52.077
Isan,

21:52.144 --> 21:54.813
it's just a rumor.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.782
I know you can't tell me
officially,

21:56.848 --> 21:59.384
but I'm asking you as a friend.

22:00.852 --> 22:03.355
Is this Jack Hendricks guy
taking over the department?

22:04.823 --> 22:07.826
I've never heard
of Jack Hendricks.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.995
So they're not talking
about hiring a new chief?

22:10.062 --> 22:11.963
Not that I know of.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.366
Everything's gonna be okay.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.974
(sighs)

22:25.977 --> 22:28.113
{\an5}They're on edge.

22:25.977 --> 22:28.113
Yeah.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.082
{\an5}And I can't get
them off it.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.082
Mm-hmm.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.983
Well, it's this sale.
Everyone's on edge.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.418
It's not just the sale.

22:33.485 --> 22:34.586
It's Jack Hendricks.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.555
Dad told me all about him.

22:36.621 --> 22:39.658
I mean, can the new owners
really just make him chief?

22:39.725 --> 22:41.359
I think they can do
whatever they want.

22:41.426 --> 22:43.395
{\an3}What do we even know
about this guy?

22:43.462 --> 22:45.097
We've been doing a deep dive.

22:45.163 --> 22:47.132
He's never practiced
in Michigan,

22:47.199 --> 22:49.134
{\an1}but your father tracked down
his records from Arizona,

22:49.201 --> 22:50.869
where he runs a department

22:50.936 --> 22:53.505
{\an1}a third of the size
of Lakeshore's.

22:53.572 --> 22:55.440
{\an3}What?

22:55.507 --> 22:58.677
Why would anybody want this guy
in such an important position?

22:58.744 --> 23:01.079
{\an1}Because he's the son
of Simon Hendricks

23:01.146 --> 23:02.881
and Eleanor Ponsonby.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.083
{\an5}As in Ponsonby Capital.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.083
Mm-hmm.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.619
Yeah. He is the nephew
of one of the senior partners

23:07.686 --> 23:10.489
of the equity firm
that wants to buy this hospital.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.157
Okay, so they're getting
the hospital

23:12.224 --> 23:13.558
and giving some relative

23:13.625 --> 23:15.427
{\an5}a promotion?

23:13.625 --> 23:15.427
Mm-hmm.

23:15.494 --> 23:17.963
Do you think
that Malcolm knows about this?

23:20.532 --> 23:23.101
{\an3}This is gonna help us figure
out why you keep falling.

23:23.168 --> 23:24.936
{\an3}We're gonna get you
in and out, okay?

23:25.003 --> 23:26.772
{\an5}Okay.

23:25.003 --> 23:26.772
All right.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.174
{\an5}(exhales)

23:26.838 --> 23:29.174
(door closes)

23:29.241 --> 23:31.710
{\an3}You sure you don't want to
give him a neck massage first?

23:31.777 --> 23:33.945
{\an5}Waste another ten minutes?

23:31.777 --> 23:33.945
(machine whirring)

23:34.012 --> 23:36.148
{\an1}It's cold in there.
If he starts shivering,

23:36.214 --> 23:38.083
{\an1}the motion artifacts
will render the images useless,

23:38.150 --> 23:40.719
{\an1}and we'd have to start the MRI
all over again.

23:40.786 --> 23:43.455
{\an5}I saved us time.

23:40.786 --> 23:43.455
{\an3}KACE: I have a weighted
blanket at home

23:43.522 --> 23:45.624
that I find very comforting.
It puts me right to sleep.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.492
{\an5}You agree with the blanket?

23:45.690 --> 23:47.492
I do.

23:47.559 --> 23:48.960
So do you.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.197
{\an5}I do?

23:49.761 --> 23:52.197
{\an1}Yeah.
But you're also concerned

23:52.264 --> 23:54.466
{\an1}that Dr. Trulie
is taking too many liberties

23:54.533 --> 23:56.802
given that she's so new, but she
totally respects the hierarchy,

23:56.868 --> 23:58.637
and she is just trying
to help, so...

23:58.703 --> 23:59.938
Start the test.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.174
{\an5}That was a good talk.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.174
(machine buzzing)

24:02.240 --> 24:04.543
(Johnny breathing heavily)

24:04.609 --> 24:06.711
(monitor beeping rapidly)

24:08.713 --> 24:10.649
His heart rate is skyrocketing.

24:10.715 --> 24:12.117
Johnny, are you okay?

24:13.618 --> 24:14.719
Johnny.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.489
He just passed out.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.158
(monitor beeping steadily)

24:20.225 --> 24:21.827
Yolanda.

24:21.893 --> 24:23.762
You just had a seizure.
You need to be in bed.

24:23.829 --> 24:25.864
I let her down.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.834
{\an1}She says I was always there
for her, but I wasn't.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.070
I was out partying.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.040
{\an1}Doing drugs,
making out with randos.

24:35.106 --> 24:36.808
What kind of drugs?

24:36.875 --> 24:39.077
{\an5}Ecstasy.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.077
ISAN:
Which wouldn't show up

24:39.144 --> 24:40.745
on normal tox screens.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.014
{\an3}Why didn't you tell
us about this sooner?

24:43.081 --> 24:44.683
{\an1}I didn't think
it was relevant.

24:44.749 --> 24:46.985
It's not like you can get
meningitis from ecstasy.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.854
{\an5}C-Can you?

24:47.052 --> 24:48.854
SAM:
No.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.889
No, no. But MDMA withdrawal

24:50.956 --> 24:54.826
can cause severe fluctuations
in body temperature.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.528
It wasn't an infection
causing your fever,

24:56.595 --> 24:58.496
{\an3}which is why the antibiotics
didn't reduce it.

24:58.563 --> 25:01.933
Antibiotics do reduce
the seizure threshold.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.768
High fever.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.570
Fluctuations
in your blood pressure

25:05.637 --> 25:07.205
and your heart rate.
All these are signs

25:07.272 --> 25:08.673
of nervous system irritability.

25:08.740 --> 25:11.209
And this constellation
of symptoms

25:11.276 --> 25:13.979
in the setting of MDMA
usage makes me think...

25:14.045 --> 25:16.147
{\an5}Serotonin syndrome.

25:14.045 --> 25:16.147
Serotonin syndrome.

25:16.214 --> 25:18.116
{\an5}Is it treatable?

25:16.214 --> 25:18.116
SAM:
Very. But we have to

25:18.183 --> 25:19.985
{\an3}run some tests to confirm,
and if we're right,

25:20.051 --> 25:21.553
{\an3}we can start
treatment right away.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.021
{\an1}So we can still do
Chloe's surgery?

25:23.088 --> 25:25.557
If we're right.

25:26.658 --> 25:28.593
(Tina humming,
vocalizing softly)

25:28.660 --> 25:30.228
(door opens)

25:31.229 --> 25:32.764
{\an3}MALCOLM:
You're in a good mood.

25:32.831 --> 25:34.633
{\an5}Money has that effect on me.

25:32.831 --> 25:34.633
{\an3}Mm.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.701
I see.

25:36.768 --> 25:39.804
Why didn't you tell me you were
planning on selling this place?

25:39.871 --> 25:41.139
I wanted to get the offer first.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.841
And, by the way,
have you seen it?

25:42.908 --> 25:44.242
{\an5}It's very aggressive.

25:42.908 --> 25:44.242
It is.

25:44.309 --> 25:47.178
It's also a conflict
of interest, isn't it?

25:47.245 --> 25:49.547
Uh, the candidate
being a relative

25:49.614 --> 25:51.283
of one of the partners
at the equity firm?

25:51.349 --> 25:52.617
So you did your homework.

25:52.684 --> 25:53.852
Uh, actually, Sam did.

25:54.853 --> 25:56.087
I thought that story was over.

25:56.154 --> 25:57.689
From what I can tell,
she's moved on

25:57.756 --> 25:58.924
to someone else already.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.826
{\an5}Don't change the subject.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.826
Okay.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.828
The conflict of interest clause

26:03.895 --> 26:06.598
applies
to the hospital's board members,

26:06.665 --> 26:08.099
not the buying entity.

26:08.166 --> 26:09.901
So it's not a deal breaker
for the board.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.137
Hmm. And what about you?

26:12.203 --> 26:13.939
I mean, you-you spend

26:14.005 --> 26:15.240
so much time being worried

26:15.307 --> 26:17.075
about Griff
running the department.

26:17.142 --> 26:19.177
Now you're just gonna hand it
over to somebody's nephew?

26:19.244 --> 26:22.647
The offer was already
in the works anyway.

26:22.714 --> 26:25.784
But throwing the nephew a bone
sweetened the deal considerably.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.319
{\an1}Sometimes
concessions must be made.

26:27.385 --> 26:28.920
Right, but these concessions

26:28.987 --> 26:31.022
could impact
a lot of people here.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.124
I mean, do you really think
it's fair to them?

26:34.125 --> 26:36.227
There's no such thing as fair.

26:36.294 --> 26:39.264
There's either
you have the power or you don't.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.967
{\an5}Your father taught me that.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.967
{\an3}You know he's not
gonna let this happen.

26:42.033 --> 26:43.234
He's not gonna have a choice.

26:43.301 --> 26:45.103
{\an1}I spent way too much time
being overruled

26:45.170 --> 26:46.371
by him, silenced by him.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.140
{\an1}And-and the terms he set
for the divorce?

26:49.207 --> 26:51.142
{\an1}It was all I could do
to hold on to my own board seat.

26:51.209 --> 26:54.212
{\an1}And then I wasn't allowed
to attend the meetings.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.849
He left me with no money,
Malcolm.

26:57.916 --> 26:59.317
{\an1}No voice.

26:59.384 --> 27:01.319
And finally,

27:01.386 --> 27:03.621
I'm evening the scales.

27:03.688 --> 27:05.190
What does that mean?

27:05.256 --> 27:08.827
It means this deal is so good,
the board has to take it.

27:08.893 --> 27:10.362
And your father will know

27:10.428 --> 27:12.964
what it feels like
to be overruled.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.967
So this is all about revenge.

27:16.034 --> 27:17.769
{\an3}Y-You're doing
all of this

27:17.836 --> 27:19.371
just to stick it to Dad?

27:19.437 --> 27:20.872
{\an5}Malcolm, it's what...

27:19.437 --> 27:20.872
No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:20.939 --> 27:22.640
{\an3}You said... You-you
said you wanted

27:22.707 --> 27:24.743
to fix things with us.
You said the reason

27:24.809 --> 27:26.945
{\an5}that you were here...

27:24.809 --> 27:26.945
It is one of the reasons.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.180
{\an5}But this is business, Malcolm.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.180
This is not business.

27:29.247 --> 27:31.116
What-Whatever this is,

27:31.182 --> 27:33.051
I want no part of it.

27:43.895 --> 27:45.330
Hey.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.365
{\an5}Can I help you?

27:45.397 --> 27:47.365
Yeah, I was just
looking for Sam,

27:47.432 --> 27:49.000
{\an5}and...

27:47.432 --> 27:49.000
Right.

27:49.067 --> 27:50.435
Everything okay, bud?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.904
You know, we're not cool,
all right? You and me.

27:52.971 --> 27:54.272
You get that, right?

27:54.339 --> 27:55.373
We're not friends.

28:05.950 --> 28:08.319
{\an5}You talked to your mom?

28:05.950 --> 28:08.319
Yeah.

28:08.386 --> 28:10.055
What happened?

28:10.121 --> 28:12.824
I trusted the wrong parent.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.225
That's what happened.

28:14.292 --> 28:16.061
Look, she doesn't care
about this hospital,

28:16.127 --> 28:17.729
and she never did.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.131
{\an1}She says my dad stiffed her
in the divorce settlement

28:20.198 --> 28:22.100
and that she's selling
this place to get back at him.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.368
Wait, what?

28:23.435 --> 28:25.470
{\an1}Yes. Look,
she's-she's had her own agenda

28:25.537 --> 28:27.005
this whole time.

28:27.072 --> 28:28.740
She says this deal
is just business,

28:28.807 --> 28:30.909
but revenge
for a bad divorce settlement

28:30.975 --> 28:33.144
seems pretty damn personal
to me.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.214
Do you think she's
telling the truth?

28:36.281 --> 28:39.317
What, about the settlement?
I-I have no idea.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.153
Why?

28:42.954 --> 28:46.724
Revenge is one thing,
but it's hard to believe

28:46.791 --> 28:49.427
there isn't something in this
for her financially.

28:49.494 --> 28:51.930
{\an1}So, you're thinking
she's getting kickbacks

28:51.996 --> 28:53.498
for brokering the sale?

28:53.565 --> 28:55.066
I think if she's not sitting

28:55.133 --> 28:57.302
on a pile of money
from their divorce,

28:57.368 --> 28:59.204
she has to get it
from somewhere.

28:59.270 --> 29:03.141
Which is a conflict of interest
that the board cannot look past.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.176
{\an5}If we can prove it.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.176
Well,

29:05.243 --> 29:06.778
I mean, if she's cashed a check,

29:06.845 --> 29:08.847
then there's a record
of that transaction.

29:08.913 --> 29:11.149
I know a real good money guy.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.152
(both chuckle)

29:16.054 --> 29:18.890
{\an4}KACE:
So, your MRI doesn't show
any evidence of a stroke.

29:18.957 --> 29:20.225
{\an5}That's good news, right?

29:18.957 --> 29:20.225
LEX: It is.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.026
But unfortunately,

29:22.093 --> 29:24.162
it still doesn't tell us why
you're having these symptoms.

29:24.229 --> 29:25.997
So, what do we do?
We just go home?

29:26.064 --> 29:27.398
You guys aren't going anywhere.

29:27.465 --> 29:29.267
{\an5}We have a lot more tests to run.

29:27.465 --> 29:29.267
(baby crying)

29:29.334 --> 29:31.102
And a few more questions to ask
about your medical history

29:31.169 --> 29:32.937
{\an5}to see if you...

29:31.169 --> 29:32.937
(monitor beeping rapidly)

29:33.004 --> 29:35.173
{\an4}His heart rate
is shooting up again.

29:33.004 --> 29:35.173
Johnny!

29:35.240 --> 29:36.407
{\an1}Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:36.474 --> 29:38.143
{\an5}(monitor beeping steadily)

29:36.474 --> 29:38.143
Hey. Hey.

29:38.209 --> 29:39.477
{\an5}You're okay. You're okay.

29:38.209 --> 29:39.477
(exhales) Wh-What happened?

29:39.544 --> 29:40.211
{\an3}Just lean back.
You just blacked out.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.312
{\an1}LEX:
Wait.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.547
The first time he fell,

29:42.614 --> 29:43.481
{\an3}you said there
was a baby there?

29:43.548 --> 29:44.916
Our granddaughter.

29:44.983 --> 29:46.851
{\an3}LEX:
Okay. And when he fell outside,

29:46.918 --> 29:49.053
{\an5}there was an ambulance siren.

29:46.918 --> 29:49.053
Let's hear it.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.556
His episodes happen
around loud sounds.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.458
They could be triggering
severe vertigo.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.093
{\an1}KACE:
Which is causing him to vagal.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.828
Which makes it
appear cardiac.

29:56.895 --> 29:58.129
And it has nothing

29:58.196 --> 29:59.330
to do with your heart.

29:59.397 --> 30:02.100
The problem is in his ear.

30:04.602 --> 30:06.838
(monitor beeping steadily)

30:08.940 --> 30:11.075
{\an5}ISAN:
Yolanda came through
for her friend after all.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.210
SAM:
Looks like it.

30:12.277 --> 30:13.478
I am placing

30:13.545 --> 30:16.114
the vascular clamp distal

30:16.181 --> 30:18.082
to the middle lobe artery.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.350
Dr. Tucker,

30:19.417 --> 30:21.119
I have a lung lobe

30:21.186 --> 30:23.321
with Chloe Mitchell's
name on it.

30:23.388 --> 30:25.223
Look at that.

30:25.290 --> 30:26.891
{\an3}Dr. Shah and I
will close.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.927
Needle driver.

30:29.694 --> 30:32.463
{\an5}GRIFF:
I'm starting
the bronchial anastomosis.

30:32.530 --> 30:35.867
And I like what I'm seeing here.

30:35.934 --> 30:37.202
JOEY:
Glad I saw the fever when I did.

30:37.268 --> 30:39.304
{\an4}ISAN:
Subtle. You want
a round of applause

30:39.370 --> 30:41.039
{\an5}for taking her temperature?

30:39.370 --> 30:41.039
{\an3}JOEY: Well, it's more
than what you did.

30:41.105 --> 30:42.974
{\an5}ISAN:
Don't even talk about...

30:41.105 --> 30:42.974
SAM: Stop it!

30:43.041 --> 30:45.076
You're both wrong.

30:45.143 --> 30:46.444
{\an1}Dr. Costa,

30:46.511 --> 30:48.446
{\an1}we all lose patients,
and for you to weaponize

30:48.513 --> 30:50.181
{\an1}that tragic event
against another doctor

30:50.248 --> 30:52.350
is inexcusable.

30:52.417 --> 30:55.353
{\an1}Dr. Shah,
you are far too comfortable

30:55.420 --> 30:56.454
playing the victim.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.855
You care too much

30:57.922 --> 30:58.623
{\an1}about what other people
think of you.

30:58.690 --> 30:59.924
Get over it.

30:59.991 --> 31:01.025
If you both cannot

31:01.092 --> 31:02.227
{\an1}get past this,
you have no place

31:02.293 --> 31:03.895
in my OR,
and you are free to go.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.196
Now.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.565
JOEY:
Sorry.

31:09.067 --> 31:10.268
ISAN:
Sorry.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.908
{\an5}JOEY:
I hope I make
a better impression

31:16.975 --> 31:18.243
on the new chief,
whoever that is.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.144
GRIFF:
The new chief will be me.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.046
{\an5}JOEY:
What about the sale?

31:20.211 --> 31:22.046
GRIFF: Not gonna happen.

31:22.113 --> 31:23.581
And that Dr. Hendricks

31:23.648 --> 31:25.483
was way out of his league.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.652
{\an3}ISAN:
Hendricks.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.554
So the rumor was true?

31:29.621 --> 31:32.523
{\an3}You said there was
no other chief. I...

31:32.590 --> 31:34.359
I asked you as a friend.

31:34.425 --> 31:35.393
{\an5}SAM:
And I was...

31:34.425 --> 31:35.393
(Isan grunts)

31:35.460 --> 31:37.362
{\an1}Isan.

31:38.529 --> 31:40.331
{\an5}Dr. Shah.

31:38.529 --> 31:40.331
ISAN:
No. No.

31:44.969 --> 31:47.071
Suction, Dr. Tucker.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.577
Unbelievable.

31:52.644 --> 31:56.314
Your mother's gotten so many
consulting fees from that firm,

31:56.381 --> 31:58.116
they should have put her
on payroll.

31:58.182 --> 32:00.318
Calling them kickbacks would've
made them easier to find.

32:00.385 --> 32:02.353
{\an5}How did you find these?

32:00.385 --> 32:02.353
She's been running

32:02.420 --> 32:03.988
the payments
through the foundation.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.156
Now, I have access

32:05.223 --> 32:06.424
to most of the accounts,

32:06.491 --> 32:08.359
but I've had no cause
to look at them.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.194
Impressive.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.430
(exhales)
It's the least I can do.

32:12.497 --> 32:13.631
What do you mean?

32:13.698 --> 32:16.501
Look, you tried to warn me.

32:16.567 --> 32:19.504
I thought I knew better,
but you were right.

32:19.570 --> 32:22.140
{\an3}She saw a weakness, she took
advantage, and now I'm...

32:22.206 --> 32:24.309
Hope is not a weakness, son.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.110
I-I just...

32:26.177 --> 32:27.445
I feel like I let you down.

32:27.512 --> 32:28.946
(chuckles softly)

32:29.013 --> 32:31.215
You wanted to believe
she could change

32:31.282 --> 32:34.118
'cause you're a good man
who sees the good in others.

32:34.185 --> 32:36.154
You didn't let me down.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.590
You made me proud.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.362
You think you can stop her?

32:45.363 --> 32:46.964
I'm gonna try.

32:51.169 --> 32:52.670
I'm sure
Isan's around somewhere.

32:52.737 --> 32:54.205
You just got to talk to him.

32:54.272 --> 32:55.440
{\an5}And say what?

32:54.272 --> 32:55.440
(faucet running)

32:55.506 --> 32:57.041
{\an5}I lied to him.

32:55.506 --> 32:57.041
(faucet turns off)

32:57.108 --> 32:58.443
And that's not gonna change.

32:58.509 --> 33:00.178
I'm gonna have to keep lying.

33:00.244 --> 33:01.713
Even if we stop the sale,

33:01.779 --> 33:04.248
my dad's secret is still there.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.150
{\an3}And now it's
my secret, too.

33:07.118 --> 33:09.220
Lying is my new normal.

33:09.287 --> 33:11.989
{\an1}I'm more like him
than I thought.

33:13.725 --> 33:16.694
You can't kill this deal because
of a few bank statements.

33:16.761 --> 33:18.763
{\an4}BYRON:
We're killing it because
of your conflict of interest.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.732
{\an3}TINA:
It's not a conflict.

33:20.798 --> 33:22.633
I told you,
my financial relationship

33:22.700 --> 33:24.502
with the firm is aboveboard.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.237
Then why didn't you disclose it?

33:27.238 --> 33:28.406
{\an3}I motion

33:28.473 --> 33:30.441
to decline this purchase offer.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.476
{\an3}I second.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.244
{\an3}BYRON:
All in favor.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.117
Disciplinary action

33:39.183 --> 33:41.285
{\an3}for the misconduct of
our fellow board member

33:41.352 --> 33:43.688
will be determined
at a later date.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.190
(door opens)

33:46.257 --> 33:48.659
{\an1}This is a closed meeting,
Dr. Griffith.

33:48.726 --> 33:50.194
{\an1}BYRON:
It's all right.

33:50.261 --> 33:51.462
{\an3}We were just
about to adjourn.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.631
Before you do, if I may?

33:57.101 --> 33:59.137
You all know
that Tina had reasons

33:59.203 --> 34:01.606
to push this deal forward,
but you don't know

34:01.672 --> 34:04.675
{\an3}how she was able to put it
in motion in the first place.

34:04.742 --> 34:06.411
She convinced the buyer

34:06.477 --> 34:08.513
that by the time
the deal went through,

34:08.579 --> 34:10.114
I would be gone

34:10.181 --> 34:12.183
{\an3}and they would be free
to appoint their guy

34:12.250 --> 34:14.051
as chief of my department.

34:14.118 --> 34:15.686
{\an3}She knew I would
agree to it

34:15.753 --> 34:18.723
because she knows my secret.

34:18.790 --> 34:22.360
It's a secret I have
kept for a long time

34:22.427 --> 34:26.531
in order to protect
my reputation, my career.

34:26.597 --> 34:28.533
{\an1}My family.

34:28.599 --> 34:30.835
But it is, in fact,
hurting them.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.371
So now you need to know
the truth.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.473
Deal is dead, Griff. It's over.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.475
Not for me.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.577
Not till you hear this.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.514
I can't believe
he's doing this.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.550
{\an1}They've already stopped
the sale.

34:45.616 --> 34:47.284
{\an3}(exhales)

34:47.351 --> 34:49.187
It's not about the sale.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.458
He's doing this for us.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.637
(exhales)

35:10.408 --> 35:13.311
Brazilian acacia.

35:13.377 --> 35:15.313
I bet you didn't know
I picked out the wood.

35:15.379 --> 35:16.614
The stain, too.

35:16.681 --> 35:18.616
{\an3}I didn't.

35:18.683 --> 35:21.719
{\an3}But then again, there's a
lot I don't know about you.

35:23.621 --> 35:26.457
Is it gonna be another 12 years
before I see

35:26.524 --> 35:27.859
{\an1}this face?

35:27.925 --> 35:30.127
This is goodbye for now.

35:30.194 --> 35:31.696
That's all I know.

35:33.197 --> 35:35.433
This didn't go how I'd planned.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.668
Oh, no, you didn't
plan this well at all.

35:37.735 --> 35:39.604
{\an3}Two wrongs

35:39.670 --> 35:41.472
don't make a right.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.808
{\an5}That's what you used to say.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.808
Did I?

35:44.909 --> 35:47.445
That's not very original, is it?

35:49.413 --> 35:51.148
I take your point.

35:51.215 --> 35:53.784
I hope you do, Mom.

35:53.851 --> 35:55.887
For your sake.

36:01.225 --> 36:04.262
{\an1}It's called superior canal
dehiscence syndrome.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.596
(chuckles):
I'll take your word for it.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.498
The bone flap in
your ear canal?

36:07.565 --> 36:09.400
It's eroded.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.302
Huh.

36:11.369 --> 36:13.237
{\an3}This makes you vulnerable
to loud sounds

36:13.304 --> 36:14.305
like babies and sirens.

36:14.372 --> 36:15.573
{\an1}They overwhelm
your system

36:15.640 --> 36:16.941
and cause a shutdown.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.242
Yeah, it's like
a power blink.

36:18.309 --> 36:19.644
{\an1}That's why
you've been falling.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.312
{\an4}LEX:
We have an ENT surgeon
on the way.

36:21.379 --> 36:22.613
{\an3}She's gonna fix
you right up

36:22.680 --> 36:23.915
and get you back to
your normal routine.

36:23.981 --> 36:26.651
{\an5}Thank you.

36:23.981 --> 36:26.651
Thank you.

36:26.717 --> 36:27.652
{\an5}Thank you.

36:26.717 --> 36:27.652
You're welcome.

36:27.718 --> 36:28.920
{\an1}Anytime.

36:28.986 --> 36:31.389
{\an1}(exhales)

36:34.959 --> 36:36.594
{\an1}VEGA:
When I was an intern,

36:36.661 --> 36:37.828
my attending told me
if I needed praise,

36:37.895 --> 36:39.463
{\an1}I should go
teach kindergarten.

36:40.264 --> 36:42.833
{\an6}That sounds like something
Griff would say.

36:40.264 --> 36:42.833
It was Griff.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.602
{\an1}He was never happy
with anything I did,

36:44.669 --> 36:47.939
but he raved about you.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.407
{\an3}Me?

36:49.473 --> 36:51.409
Called to recommend you.

36:53.578 --> 36:55.613
If you're half as good
as he says...

36:57.715 --> 36:59.717
...you might make it down here.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.992
{\an3}You know Griff
called Vega about me?

37:08.059 --> 37:09.794
{\an1}It's a good thing,
isn't it?

37:09.860 --> 37:11.395
{\an3}Yeah.

37:11.462 --> 37:13.264
I'm still gonna kill him.

37:17.034 --> 37:19.470
Isan.

37:19.537 --> 37:22.239
(sighs) I've never seen you
walk out of an OR.

37:22.306 --> 37:26.510
And I know it may not seem
like it right now,

37:26.577 --> 37:28.613
but we are on the same team.

37:32.450 --> 37:33.918
What about us?

37:37.555 --> 37:40.358
Please tell me
we can get past this.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.926
{\an1}(exhales)

37:44.895 --> 37:46.430
{\an1}I can't.

37:47.898 --> 37:49.634
I'm not ready to.

37:50.968 --> 37:53.037
Then I'll wait.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.506
I'll be here when you are ready.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.315
{\an5}You did great today.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.315
(exhales)

38:04.382 --> 38:06.384
I hate admitting
when I need help,

38:06.450 --> 38:08.552
but I needed it today, so...

38:08.619 --> 38:10.554
thanks for helping me
through it all.

38:10.621 --> 38:11.989
Yeah, anytime.

38:13.491 --> 38:15.459
You know,
I actually could use, uh,

38:15.526 --> 38:18.396
{\an5}just a little bit of help
myself.

38:15.526 --> 38:18.396
LEX: Mm-hmm.

38:19.930 --> 38:22.333
{\an3}(exhales)
I feel really awful

38:22.400 --> 38:23.801
about this whole Tim thing.

38:23.868 --> 38:25.903
Who knew a hookup

38:25.970 --> 38:28.839
on a lark
would turn into such a mess.

38:28.906 --> 38:30.641
Tim?

38:31.676 --> 38:33.711
It was you?

38:34.712 --> 38:36.647
{\an3}WOMAN:
Doctor?

38:43.421 --> 38:44.689
(chuckles softly)

38:44.755 --> 38:47.058
Board officially passed
on the offer.

38:47.124 --> 38:48.793
And my mom left.

38:48.859 --> 38:50.327
Again.

38:50.394 --> 38:53.030
{\an5}I'm sorry.

38:50.394 --> 38:53.030
Ah, no, Sam.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.567
This is a good day.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.970
My mom may not have changed,

39:00.037 --> 39:01.972
but your dad stepped up today.

39:02.039 --> 39:03.441
{\an1}You know?

39:03.507 --> 39:05.109
Telling the board
the truth like that?

39:05.176 --> 39:06.811
It's a win.

39:06.877 --> 39:08.612
Hmm.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.515
And here I thought I was
coming to cheer you up.

39:11.582 --> 39:13.918
No, but you did.
(chuckles)

39:13.984 --> 39:16.620
Look, I could've felt
really alone today,

39:16.687 --> 39:18.789
and I didn't.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.758
So thank you.

39:24.628 --> 39:25.596
Caleb.

39:25.663 --> 39:27.498
{\an3}Hey.

39:27.565 --> 39:28.966
Forget about the recruiter.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.701
That sale's off.

39:30.768 --> 39:32.069
That's great.

39:32.136 --> 39:34.638
Yeah. Nobody has
to go anywhere.

39:36.107 --> 39:39.076
Right, but let's say I did.

39:39.143 --> 39:41.812
Would you have any opinion
about where I go?

39:41.879 --> 39:43.380
S... What do you mean?

39:43.447 --> 39:45.382
Harbor Memorial
is a great hospital.

39:45.449 --> 39:47.017
It's also in Boston.

39:47.084 --> 39:48.619
{\an1}You barely reacted
to the idea

39:48.686 --> 39:50.121
{\an1}of me moving
halfway across the country.

39:50.187 --> 39:52.389
I just wonder if any part of you

39:52.456 --> 39:55.493
is hoping
I'd keep a job search local.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.696
(sighs)

39:58.763 --> 40:01.398
{\an3}If you're asking me to weigh
in on your future plans...

40:01.465 --> 40:03.134
No, I'm just asking
the question.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.803
{\an3}I asked you that
question once.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.539
You weren't ready
to answer it then.

40:08.606 --> 40:11.442
You know I'm not ready now.

40:11.509 --> 40:13.677
{\an5}Don't put this on me.

40:11.509 --> 40:13.677
I wasn't planning to,

40:13.744 --> 40:16.480
{\an5}but then things happened today
that-that...

40:13.744 --> 40:16.480
But they're not happening.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.950
We don't have to
worry about this.

40:25.890 --> 40:27.925
