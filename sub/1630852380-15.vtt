WEBVTT

00:11.359 --> 00:13.839
Hey, it's just me, buddy.

00:18.931 --> 00:21.238
If you wanted to
run away from home,

00:21.282 --> 00:23.327
probably should've picked
a better spot.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.721
Wakulsky comes up here
almost every sunset

00:25.764 --> 00:29.246
to drink and smoke.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.119
Dad usually comes along.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.078
I think I might hate him.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.036
Dad?

00:36.079 --> 00:37.211
Sounds about right.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.170
But you can't let him
see you cry, Ben.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.130
Come over here.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.787
I'm gonna teach you
how to play gin.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.093
It's Dad's favorite.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.616
When you get good enough at it,

00:51.660 --> 00:54.010
you challenge him,
and then you beat him.

00:55.359 --> 00:56.665
That's how
you earn his respect.

00:56.708 --> 00:57.970
- Is that what you did?
- Why do you think

00:58.014 --> 01:00.016
Anders taught me
how to play chess?

01:01.322 --> 01:02.453
Thanks, Blake.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.238
You got it, Benny boy.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.153
Blake? Blake?

01:06.196 --> 01:08.285
Blake? Are you listening?

01:09.330 --> 01:11.114
Yes, I heard you.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.160
Ben's been calling
the foundation asking for me.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.162
Just ignore him
or take a message.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.728
I'm not your secretary.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.556
I know you two have issues,

01:18.600 --> 01:19.949
but it's been a week
since the wedding,

01:19.992 --> 01:21.516
and his determination
isn't dying down.

01:21.559 --> 01:23.953
Is there any harm in finding out
what he wants?

01:23.996 --> 01:24.867
Yes.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.347
Family meeting. Now.

01:26.390 --> 01:27.783
We need to talk about Uncle Ben.

01:27.826 --> 01:28.914
Enough is enough.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.394
Betty is on edge

01:30.438 --> 01:32.527
because Ben keeps
calling the office nonstop.

01:32.570 --> 01:33.832
And do you remember
the last time

01:33.876 --> 01:36.270
an assistant of mine
was on edge? She shot me.

01:36.313 --> 01:37.271
Do you want me
to get shot again?

01:37.314 --> 01:38.185
Because that's
what's gonna happen

01:38.228 --> 01:39.664
if you keep ignoring
his calls.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.579
I assume Ben's been
contacting you, too.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.494
No. Is he supposed to?

01:43.538 --> 01:45.496
No, and if he does,
ignore him.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.151
I don't want you
or anyone talking to him.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.631
Excuse me?
No, sorry.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.894
Excuse me, um,
can someone explain to me

01:51.937 --> 01:53.156
where all this bad blood
comes from?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.592
I'm, like,
completely lost.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.942
If you must know,
he killed our mother.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.596
Your grandmother.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.903
Okay, I think "killed" is
a bit of an exaggeration.

02:00.946 --> 02:03.297
Blake exaggerating?
I'm shocked.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.515
Neither of you know
what you're talking about.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.082
As far as I'm concerned,

02:06.126 --> 02:08.432
Ben's negligence was murder
by another name.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.521
It was Thanksgiving,

02:10.565 --> 02:12.044
22 years ago.

02:12.088 --> 02:13.829
Everyone was here
for the weekend.

02:13.872 --> 02:16.048
My mother had had a skiing
accident a few months earlier,

02:16.092 --> 02:18.573
and she wasn't herself yet, cognitively.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.140
So she needed 24-hour care.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.620
She wouldn't let anyone
take care of her,

02:22.664 --> 02:24.318
except family.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.885
It was Ben's night to watch her,
and for some reason

02:26.929 --> 02:28.670
he left her unattended,
and she...

02:29.627 --> 02:31.629
It's okay, Blake.

02:33.109 --> 02:36.808
We found her drowned
later that night in the bathtub.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.770
She was the best woman
I ever knew.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.816
Certainly glad
I made you relive that.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.166
No one here is

02:46.209 --> 02:47.863
questioning your pain, Blake,

02:47.906 --> 02:50.431
but Ben isn't going anywhere
until you hear him out.

02:53.564 --> 02:56.132
Now that we know
the implantation worked,

02:56.176 --> 02:57.481
what's the next step?

02:57.525 --> 02:58.656
College applications?

02:58.700 --> 03:00.658
Kidding.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.225
Now we wait about ten days
for a blood test

03:02.269 --> 03:03.966
to see if I'm pregnant, right?

03:04.009 --> 03:06.055
Actually, not in this case.
You're already pregnant.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.232
Wait,
she's already pregnant?

03:09.276 --> 03:11.234
Yeah, apparently your embryo is
a bit of an overachiever.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.454
Maybe college is
a good idea.

03:13.497 --> 03:14.585
I'll give you
a few moments to yourselves,

03:14.629 --> 03:16.021
then we can discuss next steps.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.895
Well, this is fantastic news.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.244
I can't believe this is real.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.203
I mean, Liam.

03:24.639 --> 03:28.338
We're gonna be parents.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.559
Do you two want some privacy, or...

03:31.602 --> 03:34.083
- No, no. Please stay.
- No.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.390
I mean, you're such
a big part of this,

03:36.433 --> 03:38.000
and I don't even know
how to begin thanking you.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.523
I'd pretty much given up.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.046
You don't have to thank me, but...

03:41.090 --> 03:43.310
how about a group hug?

03:47.357 --> 03:48.793
Whoa.

03:48.837 --> 03:51.405
Congratulations, family.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.233
What the hell
are you doing here?

03:53.276 --> 03:55.235
I work here,
and I was just passing by

03:55.278 --> 03:55.931
as I heard

03:55.974 --> 03:57.628
the wonderful news.

03:57.672 --> 04:01.066
Between you and I, Dr. Keith has
a voice that really projects.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.503
So it's sometimes a problem

04:02.546 --> 04:04.113
for confidentiality.
You're a problem

04:04.156 --> 04:05.723
when it comes
to confidentiality.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.986
And in case you forgot,
my voice projects, too.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.553
So leave, now!

04:09.597 --> 04:12.426
Fine,
but if anyone needs any help

04:12.469 --> 04:14.428
with anything
along this prenatal journey,

04:14.471 --> 04:16.168
just, uh, ask.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.996
FALLON:Maybe never join
a group hug unannounced

04:18.040 --> 04:19.520
without permission ever again.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.217
No promises.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.658
I know I said I wanted statement
pieces for Pride weekend,

04:27.702 --> 04:30.835
but isn't this
a bit on the nose, honey?

04:30.879 --> 04:32.750
As your longtime stylist,
I'm confused.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.187
What statement are you
trying to make? "I'm boring"?

04:35.231 --> 04:37.494
Ooh! She brought the sass today.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.017
I think I'm trying to say,

04:39.061 --> 04:41.193
"I am queer, I am proud,

04:41.237 --> 04:43.935
but I'm also managing a hotel
all weekend."Fine.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.459
No to the jacket, then.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.851
Lance Bass wore something
similar to his party

04:46.895 --> 04:48.200
last night anyway, so...

04:48.244 --> 04:49.463
What?

04:49.506 --> 04:51.595
- Lance Bash was last night?
- Wait.

04:51.639 --> 04:52.727
Were you not invited?

04:52.770 --> 04:54.990
I am always on the list
for that party.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.818
I'm one of
Atlanta's most recognized

04:56.861 --> 04:59.124
and respected gay elites.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.387
I don't understand.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.126
Maybe they sent the invite

05:01.170 --> 05:02.258
to a different Sammy Jo.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.914
Hey, actually, uh,
can we finish this later?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.350
I got another client to get to.

05:08.046 --> 05:10.135
On second thought,

05:10.179 --> 05:12.050
this little number
will be perfect

05:12.094 --> 05:15.271
for my Sahara Club bash
happening tomorrow.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.273
- You're hosting?
- Of course I'm hosting.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.796
It's only gonna be
the biggest,

05:18.840 --> 05:21.843
baddest, raunchiest
Pride party in Atlanta.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.803
I think that was the most
pre-prenatal yoga session ever.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.588
Well, you know,
I just like

05:27.631 --> 05:29.503
to get ahead of things.
Thank you, by the way,

05:29.546 --> 05:32.549
for agreeing to this little
lunch and yoga surro-date.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.986
I know it's not technically
in our gestational agreement.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.293
But I just thought, now that
we're officially pregnant,

05:37.337 --> 05:39.077
- it might be nice.
- It's my pleasure.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.775
I like getting
to know you, too,

05:40.818 --> 05:43.473
and spending time in the famous
Carrington Manor is fun.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.999
You should move in.

05:48.043 --> 05:50.393
This relationship is off
to such a great start,

05:50.437 --> 05:51.829
why not make it permanent?

05:51.873 --> 05:53.570
We haven't even had
a dinner date yet,

05:53.614 --> 05:55.920
and you already want to
- cohabitate?
- Yeah.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.226
You weren't kidding
about getting ahead of things.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.793
Uh, can I think on it?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.490
- Oh, yeah. Of course.
- Also, there's one more thing.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.362
I got a job offer,

06:02.405 --> 06:04.015
but I wanted to gauge
your comfort level

06:04.059 --> 06:05.843
- before I accept it.
- Oh.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.845
I thought you loved working
at the Natural History Museum.

06:07.889 --> 06:08.977
I do,

06:09.020 --> 06:10.413
but as a paleontologist,

06:10.457 --> 06:11.719
there's always
the lure of field work,

06:11.762 --> 06:13.808
- should the opportunity arise.
- Uh-huh.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.766
And I'm guessing one has arisen?

06:15.810 --> 06:18.334
This crazy rich
real estate guy, Emmett Doyle,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.162
is funding a dig on
his large Appalachian property.

06:20.205 --> 06:22.338
Preliminary signs suggest

06:22.382 --> 06:24.122
a new subspecies
of tyrannosaur is there.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.515
Oh, wow.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.212
A tyrannosaur, okay.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.824
Um, so how long do you think
this dig would take?

06:29.867 --> 06:31.260
Maybe like a day or two?

06:31.303 --> 06:33.958
More like a month or two.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.439
Oh. Okay.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.181
It certainly sounds like
a great opportunity.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.313
I just didn't foresee you
jetting off, you know,

06:41.357 --> 06:43.490
to Jurassic Park
five minutes into the pregnancy.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.405
And what's going on
with your arm?

06:45.448 --> 06:46.884
- Is that a rash?
- Oh, yeah.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.582
I showed it to my dermo
the other day.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.366
It's nothing.
It's just eczema.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.063
Look, if you want me
to skip the dig,

06:52.107 --> 06:53.151
you can just say it.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.981
Of course I don't want you
to skip the dig.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.548
No, no, you should go.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.332
This-this is
a big deal for you.

07:00.376 --> 07:02.465
Wow. Really? Thank you.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.207
I-I guess I should get home
and get packing.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.817
Are you sure you're okay
with this?

07:06.861 --> 07:08.123
Absolutely. Yeah.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.820
You go get those fossils, girl!

07:09.864 --> 07:11.648
Okay. [laughs]
Pew.

07:14.259 --> 07:17.480
This office is a bit quainter
than I'd expect from you.

07:17.524 --> 07:20.309
Obviously
someone else decorated it.

07:20.352 --> 07:23.355
Probably your, uh,
your third wife?

07:23.399 --> 07:24.661
You're on your fourth,
aren't you?

07:24.705 --> 07:27.272
Actually, we...

07:27.316 --> 07:29.623
- we have a baby on the way.
- I don't care.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.625
Just tell me what you're doing
back in Atlanta.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.104
I have no interest
in endless chitchat

07:33.148 --> 07:34.410
with the man
who killed our mother.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.152
I didn't kill anyone.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.720
And I'm tired of
suffering the consequences

07:39.763 --> 07:41.199
from a society
that thinks otherwise.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.898
So you need to
publicly clear my name.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.682
Hold a press conference, Blake.

07:45.726 --> 07:48.119
Explain that Mother's death was
just a tragic accident.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.513
Are you kidding?
Why would I do that?

07:50.557 --> 07:51.949
I'm not comfortable lying.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.473
Wow.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.997
Only you could lie
about not lying.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.478
Just like you lied about
not seeing the note I wrote you

07:58.521 --> 08:00.305
asking you
to take care of Mother.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.307
There was no note!

08:03.570 --> 08:06.137
You invented that excuse
to cover your negligence,

08:06.181 --> 08:07.487
and it failed.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.227
Blake, I can't bring
another child into a world

08:09.271 --> 08:10.838
that thinks
I'm a negligent killer.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.361
Then move to Mars.

08:12.404 --> 08:15.407
'Cause here on Earth,
that's not changing.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.410
It's why our dad cut you
out of the will.

08:18.454 --> 08:21.239
This isn't about money, Blake.

08:22.284 --> 08:25.417
But if you can't do
what's right,

08:25.461 --> 08:27.071
you'll have to pay the price.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.986
You think you scare me,
little brother?

08:29.944 --> 08:32.120
I know I do.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.656
So, in essence, I'm thinking
this party should be

08:46.700 --> 08:48.571
<i>Call Me by Your Name</i> meets

08:48.615 --> 08:52.053
the WeHo strip meets
Tom of Finland.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.534
Wistful, twink-y,

08:54.577 --> 08:56.753
leather daddy realness,
that's the vibe.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.712
When you say "vibe,"

08:58.755 --> 09:00.148
do you mean "theme"?

09:00.191 --> 09:02.367
- Why? Is there a difference?
- You're asking us to plan

09:02.411 --> 09:04.195
a blowout in 24 hours,

09:04.239 --> 09:07.111
and "vibe" doesn't inspire
a tangible shopping list.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.461
That's why I already put one together.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.333
Yes, it's eight pages long.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.640
No, I will not be compromising,
and you, Culhane,

09:13.683 --> 09:15.076
need to make sure
the bar is stocked

09:15.119 --> 09:17.165
with enough premium vodka
to fill the Nile.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.688
Okay, let's say
we pull this off on time,

09:18.732 --> 09:20.472
which is highly doubtful,

09:20.516 --> 09:21.604
how's anyone gonna know

09:21.648 --> 09:22.953
we're even having a party here?

09:22.997 --> 09:24.302
Pride is already going on,

09:24.346 --> 09:25.826
and we haven't publicized
the event.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.131
- I have a plan.
- Are you sure you don't want to

09:27.175 --> 09:28.655
wait until your birthday
to do this?

09:28.698 --> 09:30.395
I don't need to remind anyone
about my age.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.006
But I do need to remind

09:32.049 --> 09:34.051
the Atlanta gay scene
that I'm here,

09:34.095 --> 09:36.706
so they remember to invite me
to their exclusive parties.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.447
Oh.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.405
So this is about
Lance Bass snubbing you?

09:40.449 --> 09:41.972
No. Not at all.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.106
- Okay, maybe a little bit.
- Mm-hmm.

09:45.149 --> 09:48.109
But after the year I've had, I...

09:48.152 --> 09:49.806
I think I need this.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.504
Please?

09:55.856 --> 09:57.205
Hey, I've got publisher meetings
all day,

09:57.248 --> 09:58.162
but I came home
as soon as I could.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.642
What's going on?

09:59.686 --> 10:02.732
Stacey has a rash on her arm.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.212
You're joking.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.431
I don't joke about rashes.
This is serious.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.216
I mean, what if it turns
into something more dangerous

10:08.259 --> 10:09.521
for our baby-to-be?

10:09.565 --> 10:11.088
According to the Internet...

10:11.132 --> 10:13.090
Four words that strike fear
into every doctor.

10:13.134 --> 10:16.006
This could theoretically
- kill her.
- Okay, well,

10:16.050 --> 10:18.052
I'm pretty sure Stacey hasn't
been to Micronesia lately,

10:18.095 --> 10:19.357
so I think we can rule that out.

10:19.401 --> 10:20.445
But if you're
really concerned,

10:20.489 --> 10:21.925
tell her to see a doctor.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.188
Well, she did,
and she said it was eczema.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.408
So maybe it's eczema?

10:27.670 --> 10:30.630
Look, I'm sure she would
skip the dig if you just asked.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.806
I can't ask her.
This is a new relationship.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.764
If I alienate her,
the next thing we know

10:34.808 --> 10:36.157
she's run off with our baby,

10:36.200 --> 10:37.245
and you and I are suddenly

10:37.288 --> 10:38.594
an eight-episode podcast

10:38.638 --> 10:39.900
- with a very unhappy ending.
- Okay.

10:39.943 --> 10:40.770
Well, as long
as you're not going

10:40.814 --> 10:41.771
to the worst-case scenario.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.991
Why don't we get
a second opinion

10:44.034 --> 10:45.645
and just trust the medicine?

10:45.688 --> 10:46.733
Okay?

10:49.300 --> 10:51.259
<i>There's actually something</i> <i>
I need to talk to you about.</i>

10:51.302 --> 10:53.217
Apparently,
a winner of a painting

10:53.261 --> 10:54.697
at the Gala auction

10:54.741 --> 10:55.872
flagged his Vermeer
as a possible forgery.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.744
It's probably
just a money grab,

10:57.787 --> 10:59.310
but since Ben works
in the art world,

10:59.354 --> 11:00.834
I felt you should know.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.313
This Vermeer is
from my personal collection.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.446
- So?
- So it's not a forgery.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.535
It's Ben.

11:06.578 --> 11:07.884
He probably paid the buyer

11:07.928 --> 11:09.277
to create some kind of scandal.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.105
Can you arrange a meeting
with this guy?

11:11.148 --> 11:13.673
Sure, but maybe we should
just send the curator

11:13.716 --> 11:15.283
to assess on our behalf.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.850
No. Absolutely not.
We have to be there.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.460
We need to assess way more
than whether or not

11:18.503 --> 11:20.244
this is a-a forged painting.

11:22.203 --> 11:25.075
This is so generous, Fallon.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.903
I don't even know how I'm gonna
fit it all in my car.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.209
Definitely not in my bag.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.994
Oh, which reminds me,

11:31.038 --> 11:32.387
I should probably
get home and go pack.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.215
Oh, wait, wait.
Um, there's an exfoliant

11:34.258 --> 11:37.479
way at the bottom of this basket
that I feel I need to explain.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.220
Sorry I'm late...

11:39.263 --> 11:41.526
for the brother-sister
pottery class

11:41.570 --> 11:42.571
that we have planned.

11:42.614 --> 11:43.964
Stacey! Glad I caught you.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.270
So, when I saw you
at the hospital earlier,

11:46.314 --> 11:48.795
I noticed something on your arm.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.622
Oh, this?

11:50.666 --> 11:52.276
Ugh, it's just eczema.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.061
I've already discussed it
with Fallon.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.497
Fallon's not a doctor,
last time I checked.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.804
Just saying, women
with developing pregnancies

11:57.847 --> 11:59.719
need to be extra cautious.

11:59.762 --> 12:01.285
Just, you know,
maybe take it easy this week.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.330
But that won't work.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.724
I mean, Stacey has a dig

12:04.767 --> 12:06.508
that she's supposed to go to.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.205
Could you be any stricter?

12:08.249 --> 12:09.816
Honestly,
I'm just highly sensitive

12:09.859 --> 12:11.469
to advanced
glycation end-products,

12:11.513 --> 12:13.036
which prime a production of
allergic phenotypes

12:13.080 --> 12:14.255
as an overreaction.

12:14.298 --> 12:16.518
D-Duly noted. Great.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.128
Um, so...

12:18.172 --> 12:19.651
then have an amazing dig.

12:19.695 --> 12:22.219
Thank you.
And thanks again, Fallon,

12:22.263 --> 12:24.613
for the basket, but I think
I'll pick it up when I get back.

12:24.656 --> 12:25.962
See you at the next appointment.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.399
See you then.

12:29.357 --> 12:32.099
"Have an amazing dig"?
What's wrong with you?

12:32.142 --> 12:34.797
I told you to play bad cop,
not roll-over-and-play-dead cop.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.581
Do you want my advice?

12:36.625 --> 12:38.409
Have I ever said yes to that?

12:38.453 --> 12:40.063
Just don't think about it.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.587
Stacey and her womb
are gonna be absolutely fine.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.546
You really need to relax.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.896
You know, there really is
a pottery class.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.202
We could go
throw some clay.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.857
I'd rather
throw myself off a cliff,

12:50.900 --> 12:52.249
but thank you.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.341
I don't know how much
Ben is paying you

12:57.385 --> 12:59.430
to claim the painting's a fake, but...

12:59.474 --> 13:00.823
yeah, it won't work.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.303
OSCAR:Mr. Carrington,
I don't know

13:02.346 --> 13:03.913
who Ben is, but when someone
calls to tell me

13:03.957 --> 13:05.697
my new baby is a fraud,
I'm gonna look into it.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.003
We're just here

13:07.047 --> 13:08.788
to get to the truth,
whatever that may be.

13:08.831 --> 13:12.095
The truth is this is a
finely made work of art.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.272
And a forgery.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.970
It's a very good one.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.276
And it seems to be lined
on the back with...

13:19.320 --> 13:21.278
Playing cards?
Yeah.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.150
This is Ben's work.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.413
He's sending us a message.
He's shameless.

13:25.456 --> 13:26.980
What's shameless

13:27.023 --> 13:29.156
is a charity selling forged art
to make money.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.418
We never would've

13:30.461 --> 13:32.463
knowingly auctioned off a fake.

13:32.507 --> 13:36.598
Would you accept a refund
in exchange for discretion?

13:37.599 --> 13:38.992
Add a 15% markup.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.863
You insulted me
in my own casa.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.125
That's not free.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.870
That was close.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.393
I have a feeling Ben's not done.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.747
Hello, Ben.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.837
Aren't you going to invite
your sister in?

14:01.449 --> 14:02.842
I, uh...

14:02.885 --> 14:04.756
I should have called,
I know. I wanted to.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.063
I just... I assumed

14:07.107 --> 14:10.197
- Blake poisoned the well.
- I'm disappointed.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.503
We used to get along famously,

14:12.547 --> 14:14.854
but it seems
you never knew me after all.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.203
If you had,

14:16.246 --> 14:18.988
you'd know my opinions
are self-made.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.860
Much like my success.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.209
Of course. My mistake.

14:22.252 --> 14:23.514
No, thanks.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.299
I just came to
say one thing.

14:25.342 --> 14:26.735
Whatever you're planning,

14:26.778 --> 14:28.955
I want no part
of it. Good talk.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.696
Okay. Hey, wait. All right,
I get it. I get it.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.960
You're above what's going on
between us brothers,

14:34.003 --> 14:36.788
but what I don't get
is why you're so loyal to him

14:36.832 --> 14:38.312
after all he's done.

14:38.355 --> 14:40.705
Blake and I are
- past our issues.
- I don't mean

14:40.749 --> 14:42.533
what he's done to you. I meant
what he did to your mother

14:42.577 --> 14:44.622
all those years ago.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.276
Do you remember

14:46.320 --> 14:48.148
when Lo was fired from C.A.
as Thomas's secretary?

14:48.191 --> 14:49.627
Of course.

14:49.671 --> 14:51.107
Thomas claimed she had violated

14:51.151 --> 14:54.197
a noncompete clause
in her contract.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.764
Thomas adored Lo.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.027
Never would've fired her
over something so minor.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.073
So you're saying
- Blake fired her?
- I'm saying

15:00.116 --> 15:01.901
- Blake needed the job to open up.
- Why?

15:01.944 --> 15:03.119
- For what reason?
- He wanted

15:03.163 --> 15:04.512
a mistress of his to get it.

15:05.513 --> 15:07.254
Yeah.

15:07.297 --> 15:09.517
You want to catch some dinner?
I got plenty more to tell.

15:11.519 --> 15:15.001
Like I said,
keep me the hell out of it, Ben.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.306
And don't ever

15:16.350 --> 15:19.048
offer me hotel
chardonnay again.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.403
Hey, uh, careful
with those speakers.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.666
They pack a huge punch
for a space this small.

15:30.277 --> 15:33.410
I can cross another thing
off Sam's list:

15:33.454 --> 15:36.370
speakers with bass so thick
they'll puncture an eardrum.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.328
I, for one,
appreciate the distraction.

15:38.372 --> 15:41.462
Rebuilding Colby Co. hasn't
been as smooth as I'd hoped.

15:41.505 --> 15:42.550
Well, what's the snag?

15:42.593 --> 15:43.986
Some European shell company

15:44.030 --> 15:45.509
snatched up a few
of the major divisions.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.816
And I can't find
the sales docs,

15:47.859 --> 15:49.035
which I need
so I can make someone

15:49.078 --> 15:50.123
an offer to buy them back.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.385
Maybe you should
go to Europe.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.648
I recommend Milan.

15:53.691 --> 15:56.346
Oh, did someone say Europe?

15:56.390 --> 15:59.610
I just spent the whole ride here
hounding contacts over there.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.134
Oh, for Jeff's companies?

16:01.177 --> 16:04.006
No, uh, uh,
Blake asked me to try

16:04.050 --> 16:05.573
and find out where
his brother is hiding

16:05.616 --> 16:07.575
a stolen Vermeer,
but I couldn't find anything.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.229
More information
on Ben is needed.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.274
Information I can't access
because it's encrypted.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.363
Uh...

16:13.407 --> 16:14.843
Hello?

16:14.886 --> 16:16.714
This is fate.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.281
Jeff's got hacker
skills that could solve

16:18.325 --> 16:19.543
your encryption problem.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.197
And Amanda can
use her contacts

16:21.241 --> 16:23.069
across the pond to try
and track down these sales docs.

16:23.112 --> 16:26.550
I guess, but I'm a bit gutted
that "being European"

16:26.594 --> 16:28.248
is my, uh, only asset.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.989
That could change
if you stop saying things

16:30.032 --> 16:31.642
like "little bit gutted."

16:31.686 --> 16:33.079
Yeah, well, I'm, uh,

16:33.122 --> 16:34.994
not really into helping Blake,
not even indirectly.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.647
Well, he's actually been
a lot better recently.

16:36.691 --> 16:39.302
He, uh, he even said Kirby and I
were a "handsome" couple,

16:39.346 --> 16:40.173
which is a bit...

16:40.216 --> 16:41.609
it's a bit weird,

16:41.652 --> 16:42.871
but, um, sweet.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.438
Okay.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.917
Or forget about Blake.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.310
You know the Carrington children
are good people.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.443
Some of them.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.053
Okay, I know you got
a track record in London

16:51.097 --> 16:53.142
of being on the right side
of human rights cases.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.709
So maybe partnering
with a relative

16:54.752 --> 16:57.451
who's on the same page
isn't such a bad idea.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.148
What do you say?

17:00.149 --> 17:02.412
Sure.

17:02.456 --> 17:05.111
I brought you a weighted blanket
to force you to calm down,

17:05.154 --> 17:06.634
but, hey, look at that,

17:06.677 --> 17:08.201
you've actually taken
my advice to relax.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.986
Yep, just having a
nice glass of riesling

17:11.030 --> 17:12.074
and watching a movie.
You can go now.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.337
And what movie might that be?

17:14.381 --> 17:17.427
Um, just, you know, one of those
Indiana Jones things.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.125
Uh, it looks super realistic.

17:19.168 --> 17:22.084
Okay, fine, you caught me.
I am watching

17:22.128 --> 17:24.913
a live feed of the Natural
History Museum setup

17:24.956 --> 17:25.827
of Stacey's dig.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.002
- This is sad.
- No, what's sad

17:27.046 --> 17:28.351
is that that rash

17:28.395 --> 17:29.657
could have already
spread to my baby,

17:29.700 --> 17:30.658
thanks to you.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.007
But since
you're here,

17:32.051 --> 17:33.356
how about a second
second opinion?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.532
Okay, you want
my professional opinion?

17:35.576 --> 17:38.709
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm, you're a lunatic and this is a waste of time.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.059
You're absolutely right.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.583
I am?

17:42.626 --> 17:45.412
Yeah. Pack your bags,

17:45.455 --> 17:48.589
because we need to go to
that dig site in person,

17:48.632 --> 17:50.417
pretend to
be volunteers

17:50.460 --> 17:52.593
and monitor Stacey's rash
until it goes away

17:52.636 --> 17:54.377
or, you know,
until she goes home.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.814
You're really putting the "rash"
into irrational right now,

17:56.858 --> 17:59.774
because Stacey will
definitely recognize us.

17:59.817 --> 18:01.950
That dig site is huge. There
will be hundreds of volunteers.

18:01.993 --> 18:04.387
What's two more? And it's your
fault we're in this mess.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.128
Go on.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.260
Tell me your list of demands.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.877
If I go to the dig, I would like

18:15.920 --> 18:18.140
weekly one-on-one dinners
with you.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.489
I'm not exactly

18:19.533 --> 18:21.056
the most popular
Carrington right now,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.145
and your approval
- could really help.
- Perfect.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.538
How's biannual?

18:24.581 --> 18:26.888
- Weekly or no deal.
- Fine. Okay.

18:26.931 --> 18:29.369
Go pack a pair of
binoculars, a shovel,

18:29.412 --> 18:30.979
and wear whatever
paleontologists wear.

18:31.022 --> 18:33.242
We leave first thing
in the morning.

18:33.286 --> 18:34.809
Thank you.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.681
Uh, what's with
the construction stuff?

18:37.725 --> 18:38.987
Did the theme
of the party change

18:39.030 --> 18:40.510
to Village People realness?

18:40.554 --> 18:42.599
The theme's the same,
but I had a revelation

18:42.643 --> 18:44.427
about our promotion strategy.

18:44.471 --> 18:46.516
We're not giving out
flyers anymore.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.518
Good. So we can go home.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.303
No.

18:50.346 --> 18:51.695
If we want
a huge crowd,

18:51.739 --> 18:54.002
we need to bring Pride
to the party.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.396
Kind of like
a gay <i>Field of Dreams.</i>

18:56.439 --> 18:58.659
If you build it in
the right spot, they will come.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.051
So to speak.

19:00.095 --> 19:01.357
I'm exhausted,
and I've never seen

19:01.401 --> 19:03.446
<i>Dreams of Field,</i>
so why don't you tell us

19:03.490 --> 19:05.056
the new plan, Sammy Jo?

19:05.100 --> 19:06.797
We're going to redirect
the Pride parade route

19:06.841 --> 19:09.322
to pass directly in front
of the Sahara Club.

19:09.365 --> 19:10.975
That way, the paraders
will have no choice

19:11.019 --> 19:12.629
but to get drawn in.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.284
So we're going to illegally
move the street barriers?

19:15.328 --> 19:16.198
And add some.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.591
I guess if you're not

19:17.634 --> 19:19.941
a true ally,
you don't have to help.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.861
Okay, fine, we'll help you.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.993
But only

19:29.037 --> 19:31.300
if you stop being
such a Pridezilla.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.390
Father, Son and House of Gucci.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.654
Maybe...

19:37.698 --> 19:40.396
this will help you
forget about Ben.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.138
Yeah. That's a bit better.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.835
Mmm.

19:44.879 --> 19:47.403
Mmm, yeah.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.840
I'm feeling my focus shifting.

19:49.884 --> 19:50.928
So can I.

19:52.495 --> 19:55.411
Don't look at it.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.631
Oh, no, I have to, I'm sorry.
Just-just give me a second.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.944
- What is it?
- Oh, I knew

20:06.988 --> 20:08.772
that millennial slacker
would sell me out.

20:08.816 --> 20:11.558
The <i>Times</i> has a story,
"Blake Carrington

20:11.601 --> 20:16.302
"intentionally donates multiple
forged paintings to charity

20:16.345 --> 20:17.868
for huge tax
write-offs."

20:17.912 --> 20:19.479
There are other
forgeries?

20:19.522 --> 20:21.002
Three more have been reported.

20:21.045 --> 20:22.699
When did Ben even steal
these paintings from you?

20:22.743 --> 20:24.484
Well, hold on a second.

20:24.527 --> 20:28.488
All four of these paintings
were stored in a safe

20:28.531 --> 20:30.272
at the Carrington Compound.

20:30.316 --> 20:33.754
He must've swapped out the
originals for fakes he had made.

20:33.797 --> 20:36.757
This could be a disaster
for PPA and Flores.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.108
Clients are willing
to weather a scandal or two,

20:40.151 --> 20:42.545
but ripping off a charity
doesn't play well.

20:43.851 --> 20:46.245
Is there any chance
that you can just

20:46.288 --> 20:47.594
give Ben what he wants?

20:47.637 --> 20:49.291
It's only a statement
to the press.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.120
Stop. Don't ever
ask me that again.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.209
I'll figure it out.
I just don't know how yet.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.524
Wow. This is incredible.

21:04.567 --> 21:07.309
We're actually
unearthing history.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.311
Easy, Indiana Bones.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.226
Digging is not
why we're here.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.272
Now, give me those binoculars
so I can try to find Stacey.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.099
All right. Which
lens do you want?

21:15.143 --> 21:18.146
I have Porro prism
or roof prism.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.365
Of course you have options.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.196
Okay.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.329
Oh. I think...

21:27.373 --> 21:29.244
Yep, I found her.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.941
Ah. I found an ancient tooth.

21:30.985 --> 21:33.640
That's a rock.
Now, come on, focus, focus.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.077
Less paleontology,
more dermatology.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.688
Remember? There she
is at 11 o'clock.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.603
Well, the good news is,
it looks like her rash

21:40.647 --> 21:41.822
has completely disappeared.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.432
That's fantastic.

21:43.476 --> 21:45.391
The bad news is,
I'm kind of disappointed.

21:45.434 --> 21:48.176
I wanted to spend
more time in the bone zone.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.830
Oh! Mother of Parksosaurus,

21:49.873 --> 21:51.397
that really hurt.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.876
That's what you get for
saying "bone zone."

21:52.920 --> 21:54.400
What happened?

21:54.443 --> 21:57.316
I sat on the pick.
I could have been impaled.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.795
Oh, no.

21:58.839 --> 21:59.927
No, no, I'm fine.
Thanks for checking.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.015
No, I'm not concerned about you.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.364
I'm looking around

22:02.408 --> 22:03.757
at all the sharp tools everywhere.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.237
This place is like
a torture chamber.

22:06.281 --> 22:09.632
These tools are far less
hazardous than the-the spiders

22:09.676 --> 22:12.461
and the rattlesnakes
and the punishing sun,

22:12.505 --> 22:14.202
and I can tell I'm not
soothing you right now.

22:14.245 --> 22:17.684
No. We need to get my precious
cargo out of here now.

22:17.727 --> 22:19.599
ADAM:Since you won't actually
talk to Stacey,

22:19.642 --> 22:21.340
how do you propose we do that?

22:21.383 --> 22:24.604
It's simple. We just find
out who her supervisor is

22:24.647 --> 22:26.562
and get Stacey fired.

22:26.606 --> 22:27.868
Aww.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.132
I have to talk to you.

22:31.175 --> 22:32.568
Can it wait?

22:32.612 --> 22:34.135
Our little brother's antics
have got me

22:34.178 --> 22:36.703
on round-the-clock
damage control.

22:36.746 --> 22:39.358
How about we talk about <i>
your</i> antics for a second?

22:39.401 --> 22:41.969
Did you have my mother
fired from C.A.

22:42.012 --> 22:45.233
because you wanted
your mistress to work there?

22:45.276 --> 22:46.539
I'm guessing you talked to Ben,

22:46.582 --> 22:48.628
after I explicitly
told you not to.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.760
You don't control
my social calendar.

22:50.804 --> 22:53.372
You're deflecting.
Is it true or not?

22:53.415 --> 22:56.157
Fine, okay? Yeah, it's true.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.768
But that's ancient history.
I mean, i-if I'm being honest,

22:58.812 --> 23:00.422
I can't even remember
the mistress's name.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.729
Do you think that makes
you look better?

23:02.772 --> 23:04.121
Look, had I known that the job
was so important to Lo,

23:04.165 --> 23:06.515
and that she was
raising my half sister,

23:06.559 --> 23:08.822
I probably wouldn't
have had her fired.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.432
Probably?

23:10.476 --> 23:13.043
You didn't just
have her fired.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.654
You damned her
to a different life.

23:14.697 --> 23:19.180
A much more
difficult life, Blake.

23:19.223 --> 23:22.575
I'm-I'm sorry. I am.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.316
You're hurt.
I get that.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.015
But can't you see that this
is exactly what Ben wants,

23:28.058 --> 23:30.583
to drive a wedge between us?

23:30.626 --> 23:33.107
Come on, you know that
I'm a different person now.

23:33.150 --> 23:35.239
What I see is a little boy
fighting with his brother

23:35.283 --> 23:36.806
like he's playing
kids' games again.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.157
Good luck.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.686
What took you so long?

23:46.729 --> 23:48.731
I swiped Stacey's backpack
while she was in the bathroom,

23:48.775 --> 23:50.559
but she'll be back any second.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.648
Um, I think that procuring
a bin of valuable,

23:52.692 --> 23:54.911
not-yet-catalogued fossils
is a much harder job.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.566
Great, congratulations.
Can you move any faster?

23:57.610 --> 23:58.959
Break them for all that I care.

23:59.002 --> 24:00.482
We're trying to get her fired,
remember?

24:00.526 --> 24:02.745
Oh, plus, I tipped off
Chloe the supervisor

24:02.789 --> 24:04.486
while you were
playing in the dirt.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.835
Where do you want these to go?

24:05.879 --> 24:06.532
I want it to go
on that table over there.

24:06.575 --> 24:07.620
Go.

24:17.368 --> 24:19.849
Don't skip, don't skip.

24:19.893 --> 24:22.286
- Okay, good, good.
- Okay.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.724
Now Chloe will bring
Stacey over here

24:24.767 --> 24:26.726
to reprimand her any second.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.205
And once she sees

24:28.249 --> 24:29.859
that she's been skimming fossils
off the top,

24:29.903 --> 24:32.079
she'll have no choice
but to fire her and my baby.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.211
- Hide. They're coming.
- Oh...

24:34.255 --> 24:36.431
So, what exactly
is this about?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.128
And why is my bag here?

24:38.172 --> 24:39.956
I don't know,
but I heard rumors,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.524
which is, I'm sure,
all they are, you know?

24:42.568 --> 24:44.091
Nevertheless, I have
to perform my due diligence

24:44.134 --> 24:45.309
and search your bag.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.529
For what? Uh, stolen granola?

24:47.573 --> 24:48.748
Uh, guilty as charged.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.619
Wait, hold on.

24:50.663 --> 24:51.533
Is this...

24:52.578 --> 24:53.927
That looks like a tooth

24:53.970 --> 24:55.885
belonging to a species
of <i>Dryptosaurus.</i>

24:55.929 --> 24:57.408
Why is this in your bag?

24:57.452 --> 24:58.366
I have no idea,

24:58.409 --> 24:59.759
except that someone

24:59.802 --> 25:00.934
is clearly trying to frame me.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.718
You get
anonymously tipped off,

25:02.762 --> 25:03.806
my bag gets moved

25:03.850 --> 25:05.286
and now there's a tooth in it?

25:05.329 --> 25:06.635
I don't care how it got
in your bag,

25:06.679 --> 25:09.377
because this
is a huge discovery.

25:09.420 --> 25:10.552
Let's show the team.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.336
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.254
What the hell
are you smiling about?

25:17.298 --> 25:18.952
That was a total failure.

25:18.995 --> 25:21.781
Because it was a tooth.
Maybe I should be Indiana Jones.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.304
Indiana Jones doesn't
even look for fossils.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.001
That's <i>Jurassic...</i>

25:25.045 --> 25:27.656
Oh. Hold on.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.832
I've got a call to make.

25:29.876 --> 25:32.313
I hate to say it,
but it seems like

25:32.356 --> 25:35.446
Sam's insane blockade idea
is actually working.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.318
Do you think he'll like
all this stuff?

25:37.361 --> 25:39.799
If he doesn't, we'll just get
him liquored up until he does.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.627
Speaking of which, I should
check on the bar stock,

25:41.670 --> 25:44.586
because Sam was not kidding
about folks loving they vodka.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.633
Well, look at you.

25:47.676 --> 25:48.938
Happy Pride.

25:50.679 --> 25:52.638
Oh, I love how awkward
straight people are

25:52.681 --> 25:54.378
when they say that.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.425
Hello?

25:57.468 --> 25:59.514
Did that kiss
even register for you?

25:59.558 --> 26:02.256
Yes. Yes, I'm so sorry. Um...

26:02.299 --> 26:04.388
You know how I was, like,
helping Jeff try and find out

26:04.432 --> 26:05.912
who was hoarding
his Colby Co. divisions?

26:05.955 --> 26:07.740
Well, I found out.

26:07.783 --> 26:09.306
It's Blake.

26:09.350 --> 26:12.266
Blake Carrington?
Of course Blake Carrington.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.616
And now I have to decide
whether to tell or not.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.444
And I can either
betray Jeff

26:16.487 --> 26:18.446
and say nothing
or I can betray Blake

26:18.489 --> 26:20.709
a-and I can start a whole new
Carrington-Colby war.

26:20.753 --> 26:23.016
I'm not telling you what to do,

26:23.059 --> 26:25.627
but one of those people
is trying to create jobs

26:25.671 --> 26:27.586
for his community and the other
is currently being smeared

26:27.629 --> 26:29.196
as a charity scammer.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.982
I guess I'm just gonna have
to drink my way to a decision.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.028
Oh, oh, thank you.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.682
Ah. Healthy.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.467
One sec.

26:39.510 --> 26:42.470
So you sold a book
without even having an idea?

26:42.513 --> 26:44.167
Are people just
throwing money at you now?

26:44.211 --> 26:45.691
Pretty much. I mean, apparently,

26:45.734 --> 26:47.301
a little movie hype
goes a long way.

26:47.344 --> 26:50.260
The publisher was willing
to offer a blind deal.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.653
Ugh, I'm so proud of you.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.742
I would throw myself at you,
right now,

26:53.786 --> 26:56.049
but I can't, you know,
because of the wet nails.

26:56.092 --> 26:57.441
It's funny,

26:57.485 --> 26:58.399
my day was pretty much
the opposite.

26:58.442 --> 27:00.053
You know? Just boring.

27:00.096 --> 27:03.143
As soon as those hands are free,
we can spice it up a little bit.

27:03.186 --> 27:05.014
Hi, you two.

27:05.058 --> 27:08.539
Stacey. You're back
from the dig already?

27:08.583 --> 27:10.498
Yes, but only because
it was shut down.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.805
- Oh.
- Oh, your dig got shut down?

27:12.848 --> 27:14.241
- STACEY:Mm-hmm.
- Why?

27:14.284 --> 27:15.764
Ah, don't make her
relive the details.

27:15.808 --> 27:18.288
Apparently, a billionaire
bought the land

27:18.332 --> 27:20.116
and decided to use
the findings to kick-start

27:20.160 --> 27:21.640
some top secret project

27:21.683 --> 27:25.208
involving DNA mining and
dinosaur reanimation.

27:25.252 --> 27:26.383
Whoa. Like a,

27:26.427 --> 27:27.950
like a real-life <i>Jurassic Park?</i>

27:27.994 --> 27:29.909
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow. Someone's got some money to burn.

27:29.952 --> 27:32.128
Or someone's really
good at lying.

27:34.435 --> 27:38.178
Fallon, could I see
your hand for a second?

27:38.221 --> 27:40.441
Uh, no, no. I hate to show
a work in progress.

27:40.484 --> 27:42.399
Come on, Fallon.

27:42.443 --> 27:43.487
Um...

27:47.143 --> 27:48.144
There's dirt under your nails.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.668
Well, yes, of course there is.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.495
This morning,

27:51.539 --> 27:53.584
I noticed the begonias
outside were trash,

27:53.628 --> 27:55.630
so I uprooted them myself.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.241
Fallon, stop. I also saw
your ridiculous floppy hat

27:58.285 --> 28:00.243
on the way in here and
I recognized it from the dig.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.811
You shut us down, didn't you?

28:02.855 --> 28:04.726
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
what's going on here, Fallon?

28:04.770 --> 28:05.901
What's she talking about?

28:05.945 --> 28:08.251
Okay, all right,
I'm sorry, I did.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.601
Oh, my God.
- But you have to look at it from my side.

28:10.645 --> 28:13.126
First you had this
terrifying, ugly rash,

28:13.169 --> 28:14.997
and then,
I go to the dig site,

28:15.041 --> 28:16.259
and it's basically a death trap.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.087
I was just trying
to protect you.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.350
It sounds more like you didn't
trust me to protect myself.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.352
I offered to not go.

28:22.396 --> 28:23.789
Yes, I know that,
but our relationship

28:23.832 --> 28:25.181
is still in the early stages,

28:25.225 --> 28:26.313
and I didn't want
to rock the boat.

28:26.356 --> 28:27.749
So you capsized it instead?

28:28.924 --> 28:30.752
Uh, maybe this arrangement

28:30.796 --> 28:32.406
should be more transactional.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.974
Appointments only.
No yoga, no lunches,

28:35.017 --> 28:37.237
and definitely
no moving in here.

28:40.283 --> 28:42.024
Fallon.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.460
What's gotten into you?

28:43.504 --> 28:45.724
I honestly don't know anymore.

28:51.338 --> 28:54.602
Hello, hello, hello. Everyone
having a fun Pride Ride?

28:58.911 --> 29:04.090
Well, thank you for coming to
Sahara Club's very first Pride.

29:06.701 --> 29:09.486
I know how you all like it:
no chitchat,

29:09.530 --> 29:10.879
just getting down to business.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.620
So I won't bore you
with a speech.

29:12.663 --> 29:15.536
Except to say if you don't see
Lance Bass at this party,

29:15.579 --> 29:17.581
it's because he wasn't invited.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.541
Anyway, time to get drunk,

29:20.584 --> 29:24.806
because Miss Angeria
Paris VanMicheals

29:24.850 --> 29:26.982
is on her way!

29:32.814 --> 29:33.859
He seems to like the party.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.164
I think that's what that meant.

29:35.208 --> 29:36.775
This party is a disaster.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.341
Where are the assless chaps?

29:38.385 --> 29:40.822
Plus, I heard
a rumor that one

29:40.866 --> 29:43.782
of the go-go dancers
is actually straight.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.827
You gave us one day
to throw this thing together.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.437
Whatever happened
to being thankful

29:47.481 --> 29:49.309
and chilling out
after we helped you?

29:49.352 --> 29:51.006
That was before
you failed me.

29:51.964 --> 29:52.878
Also, why is no one drinking?

29:52.921 --> 29:54.575
They were,
but they wiped us out.

29:54.618 --> 29:56.316
And the supplier can't make it
here to restock the bar

29:56.359 --> 29:57.752
since he's stuck in traffic

29:57.796 --> 30:00.276
because someone messed
with the parade route.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.800
Maybe this is
partially your fault?

30:01.843 --> 30:04.280
No, no, no, no, no.
This is all my fault.

30:04.324 --> 30:07.544
For putting too much Pride
responsibility on a straight guy

30:07.588 --> 30:09.895
and a girl who's gay
only when it's convenient.

30:09.938 --> 30:13.333
Wow. You really went there?

30:13.376 --> 30:15.161
Okay, we're done.

30:15.204 --> 30:18.033
Kirby, shall we?

30:18.077 --> 30:19.469
Well, fine.

30:19.513 --> 30:20.775
I guess if I want
things done right,

30:20.819 --> 30:22.211
I know who not to ask.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.213
So, what am I supposed to do?

30:24.257 --> 30:25.867
Just give up
and let Stacey

30:25.911 --> 30:29.044
run around putting herself
and my baby in danger?

30:29.088 --> 30:31.438
No, but breach of contract
is a dead end, okay?

30:31.481 --> 30:32.874
If Stacey doesn't want you
in her personal life,

30:32.918 --> 30:34.093
then-then that's her call.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.746
Hey, did you see
where that, um,

30:35.790 --> 30:37.705
go-go dancer went, 'cause
I was not finished with him.

30:37.748 --> 30:40.664
He left, like, five minutes ago.
How many drinks have you had?

30:40.708 --> 30:42.841
Like, four? Anyway,

30:42.884 --> 30:44.364
at the end of the day,
in nine months,

30:44.407 --> 30:46.061
a baby's gonna appear,
and you don't have to see

30:46.105 --> 30:47.236
how the sausage is made.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.716
Don't call my baby a sausage.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.239
10-4, good buddy.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.589
Ooh.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.287
Where's Legally Bland
going so quickly?

30:54.330 --> 30:55.897
I'd assume
getting away from you.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.464
- Hmm.
- Why are you here

30:57.507 --> 30:59.031
and dressed like you run
a conversion therapy camp?

30:59.074 --> 31:00.597
Read the room, Adam.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.382
Sorry, I-I wasn't gonna come,

31:02.425 --> 31:04.253
but then I heard about
what happened with Stacey.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.168
Oh. So you wanted
to gloat in person?

31:06.212 --> 31:07.778
I wanted to apologize.

31:07.822 --> 31:10.129
I-I know this was not
the outcome you wanted.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.218
Well, I appreciate the effort,
but couldn't this have waited

31:12.261 --> 31:14.046
until one of our
forced-at-gunpoint
weekly dinners?

31:14.089 --> 31:15.961
No. No, no, no.
You're off the hook for that.

31:16.004 --> 31:19.225
I'm not gonna force you to do
something you don't want to do.

31:19.268 --> 31:20.922
Just, um, you know,
don't forget about me

31:20.966 --> 31:22.576
next time you go
on a little mission.

31:22.619 --> 31:25.666
Well, that's surprisingly
mature of you.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.363
It was nice
to be connected.

31:27.407 --> 31:30.453
Um, you know, I just,
I don't want to be left behind

31:30.497 --> 31:32.368
when the next generation starts.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.719
Something wrong?

31:35.763 --> 31:36.938
No.

31:36.982 --> 31:39.027
Uh, Sammy Jo?

31:39.071 --> 31:41.638
Child, what are you
doing to yourself

31:41.682 --> 31:43.466
in my dressing room?

31:43.510 --> 31:45.686
Oh, my God.

31:45.729 --> 31:49.385
Miss Angeria Paris VanMicheals.

31:49.429 --> 31:50.865
Whoa!

31:50.909 --> 31:53.389
Almost. I am such a huge fan.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.478
It's an honor to meet you.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.437
I just need five more minutes
of dragsforming,

31:57.480 --> 31:59.134
and then I'll be ready
for your performance,

31:59.178 --> 32:00.614
which is now a duet.

32:00.657 --> 32:03.791
So <i>our</i> performance.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.314
Uh, I wasn't aware you do drag.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.489
Well, I don't normally.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.013
It's a special occasion.

32:08.056 --> 32:11.842
So please allow me
to introduce to you...

32:11.886 --> 32:13.801
Samantha Jones.

32:13.844 --> 32:15.672
She's here to save
this tragic party.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.587
You know that name
is very taken, right?

32:17.631 --> 32:19.067
Well... And Angeria

32:19.111 --> 32:20.721
doesn't do this duet thing.

32:20.764 --> 32:23.028
This pageant queen
is all about polish.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.551
I know it's very
last minute,

32:24.594 --> 32:27.989
but I need to create
a gay watercooler moment.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.949
Lance did it at Lance Bash,
and if I don't top that,

32:30.992 --> 32:33.821
I might never
get taken seriously

32:33.864 --> 32:35.997
as one of Atlanta's top gays.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.781
Okay, hold on.

32:37.825 --> 32:40.828
You don't do drag because you're
trying to prove something.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.482
You got to do it for you.

32:42.525 --> 32:44.092
And also,

32:44.136 --> 32:45.137
the appearance fees.

32:45.180 --> 32:46.921
Come on.

32:48.314 --> 32:49.576
Sit down.

32:52.274 --> 32:54.233
Look at me. This is who I am,

32:54.276 --> 32:57.758
and I'm not trying to be
anything but myself.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.455
If you have to put
on a breastplate

32:59.499 --> 33:01.718
that doesn't even match
your skin tone,

33:01.762 --> 33:05.635
I need you
to press pause, breathe

33:05.679 --> 33:07.507
and figure out
what's going on with you

33:07.550 --> 33:09.465
that forced you
into this moment.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.293
Is this clicking for you, honey?

33:11.337 --> 33:12.816
Yes, Mother.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.731
Okay.

33:19.736 --> 33:20.955
Ben,

33:20.999 --> 33:22.957
this is excellent timing.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.567
I was just looking
at an auction catalogue.

33:24.611 --> 33:27.353
Maybe you could lend me
your artistic expertise.

33:27.396 --> 33:31.183
Stop gloating, Blake.
How'd you do it?

33:31.226 --> 33:34.229
You must be referring
to the <i>Times</i> retraction.

33:34.273 --> 33:39.017
Well, I guess they just realized
I was an innocent man after all.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.540
We both know
that's a load of crap.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.933
So, what'd you do?

33:42.977 --> 33:44.892
You remember our neighbor
at the Carrington Compound,

33:44.935 --> 33:46.415
Mr. Wakulsky?

33:46.459 --> 33:49.201
We used to camp out
in his deer blinds?

33:49.244 --> 33:51.594
He was always on the cutting
edge of hunting technology?

33:51.638 --> 33:53.683
He installed, like, sensors

33:53.727 --> 33:57.252
and traps and even...

33:57.296 --> 34:00.212
motion-activated cameras.

34:00.255 --> 34:04.694
There you are, loading my
stolen art into a van.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.654
Well, that man's wearing a mask.
These prove nothing.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.178
Yeah, it proves
that I was robbed.

34:10.222 --> 34:11.701
Which clears my name.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.094
This isn't fair.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.053
It's like when I taught
you to play gin.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.445
You always knocked too early.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.665
You didn't evaluate
all the outcomes.

34:18.708 --> 34:22.103
Then when you lost, you'd cry,
"Oh, it's not fair."

34:22.147 --> 34:24.975
Seems like things
don't change, do they?

34:25.019 --> 34:26.803
I loved our mother, Blake.

34:26.847 --> 34:29.197
I was devastated
when she died.

34:29.241 --> 34:30.546
You killed her.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.983
And none of your
lies will ever,

34:33.027 --> 34:34.811
ever change that.

34:34.855 --> 34:36.683
Now get on your plane
and go back to Paris.

34:39.164 --> 34:41.427
Game over. Again.

34:50.131 --> 34:53.352
So, after I came up dry
on the stolen art,

34:53.395 --> 34:54.701
I did some digging.

34:54.744 --> 34:55.615
And when you dig,

34:55.658 --> 34:56.877
you are bound to find some dirt.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.314
So, what dirt did you find,

34:59.358 --> 35:01.055
brand-new cousin of mine?

35:01.099 --> 35:04.189
Well, Ben's requested a copy
of our grandfather's will

35:04.232 --> 35:06.800
as it was signed and witnessed
in the year 2000.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.323
Cool, I-I don't really know
what that means,

35:08.367 --> 35:11.239
but I imagine that Blake will,
so thank you.

35:11.283 --> 35:13.285
Yeah, maybe don't
remind me who this is for.

35:13.328 --> 35:14.982
So, what about you?

35:15.025 --> 35:16.331
Did you find anything for me?

35:18.377 --> 35:21.945
Um, you know,
I'm so sorry, Jeff.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.425
It was, like, just dead ends,
you know?

35:23.469 --> 35:24.948
I don't think
that there's any finding out

35:24.992 --> 35:27.299
who owns these pieces
of Colby Co., so...

35:27.342 --> 35:28.561
Ah, well,

35:28.604 --> 35:29.910
I thank you for trying.

35:29.953 --> 35:32.173
So, are you,
you about to head out?

35:32.217 --> 35:34.349
Well, I can finish that drink
for you if you want.

35:34.393 --> 35:35.959
I'm gonna stick around
for Angeria.

35:36.003 --> 35:37.570
I'm a big fan.

35:37.613 --> 35:40.181
She, she gives it
to you straight.

35:41.356 --> 35:42.836
No pun intended.

35:42.879 --> 35:44.533
Oh.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.187
Look who it is.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.536
Did you come
to devalue

35:47.580 --> 35:49.582
my experience
as a queer person again?

35:49.625 --> 35:51.061
Because if you have,

35:51.105 --> 35:52.062
I have comebacks.

35:52.106 --> 35:53.455
Fire away, bitch.

35:53.499 --> 35:56.545
I feel awful about
what I said earlier.

35:56.589 --> 35:59.679
It was way out of line.

35:59.722 --> 36:01.985
I owe you both a huge apology.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.248
It better be good.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.512
Look, I-I know I've been
going overboard.

36:06.555 --> 36:08.644
And I know it seems
it was because

36:08.688 --> 36:11.734
I was upset that I didn't get
invited to Lance's party,

36:11.778 --> 36:14.563
but after talking to Angeria,
I realized

36:14.607 --> 36:16.957
that I was more upset
about the why than the what.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.481
It would help if we knew
what you were talking about.

36:19.525 --> 36:21.222
Look, ever since my dad died,

36:21.266 --> 36:25.444
I've been kind of lost
in my identity.

36:25.487 --> 36:26.706
Like, like I'm
supposed to enter

36:26.749 --> 36:28.229
a new phase in my life,

36:28.273 --> 36:30.231
but I have no idea what that is.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.406
That's not something
you're supposed to figure out

36:31.450 --> 36:32.929
- all at once.
- Yes, but...

36:32.973 --> 36:34.453
after getting snubbed by Lance,

36:34.496 --> 36:36.803
I felt like my community
had forgotten about me.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.674
Like, I've
been so busy

36:38.718 --> 36:40.894
with life and work

36:40.937 --> 36:46.029
that I lost that...
visibly queer part of myself.

36:46.073 --> 36:48.597
And this party was
my way of asserting

36:48.641 --> 36:51.296
that I'm still here, that I'm...

36:51.339 --> 36:53.559
that I'm just as gay
as anyone else.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.778
Uh, mission accomplished.

36:57.302 --> 37:00.261
I ended up turning into someone
I didn't recognize and...

37:01.871 --> 37:04.352
...I am so sorry for the way
I treated you.

37:04.396 --> 37:07.094
I think we should hug.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.835
Uh, yes.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.750
Me, too, except there are
so many sequins on this jacket,

37:10.793 --> 37:12.578
you'll cut yourself if you do.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.188
But...

37:14.232 --> 37:16.799
I got some champagne.

37:17.583 --> 37:18.888
Someone dropped this off
the other day.

37:21.108 --> 37:24.503
Uh, Sam, h-have you
read that bottle?

37:24.546 --> 37:26.635
Yes, it says "champagne,"

37:26.679 --> 37:32.075
and "You are cordially invited
to Lance Bash."

37:33.120 --> 37:34.208
Is this...

37:34.252 --> 37:35.296
An invitation to Lance's party?

37:35.340 --> 37:37.907
Yeah, it seems like it.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.387
<i>So, you weren't</i>

37:39.431 --> 37:41.259
actually concerned
about my safety?

37:41.302 --> 37:42.869
This is a weird apology.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.741
Stacey, I'm always gonna be
concerned about your safety.

37:45.785 --> 37:49.484
But I can also tell
that you're an intelligent,

37:49.528 --> 37:51.834
rational person
who can take care of herself.

37:51.878 --> 37:54.010
If you know I'm capable
and you weren't worried,

37:54.054 --> 37:55.490
then why the sabotage?

37:56.839 --> 37:59.277
I just didn't realize
how this surrogate pregnancy

37:59.320 --> 38:02.323
was gonna make me feel until
it actually became a reality.

38:02.367 --> 38:06.980
And then once it did, I just...
I wanted to be around you,

38:07.023 --> 38:09.548
or the pregnancy,
as much as possible.

38:09.591 --> 38:13.160
No, I get it. You weren't
worried about me at all,

38:13.203 --> 38:15.205
you were worried about Fallon.

38:15.249 --> 38:17.947
Yes, exactly.
Which will make perfect sense

38:17.991 --> 38:19.340
as you get to know me.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.342
I just don't want
to miss out on anything.

38:21.386 --> 38:25.651
Every feeling, every moment
of this pregnancy,

38:25.694 --> 38:30.699
and two months away just felt
like I would miss a lot.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.658
And I am sorry,

38:32.701 --> 38:35.617
because I know myself,
and I should've known

38:35.661 --> 38:37.315
I was gonna feel this way.

38:39.229 --> 38:41.754
Well, everybody's journey
with this is different,

38:41.797 --> 38:46.019
and you're gonna feel
how you're gonna feel.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.328
But I accept your apology.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.504
Thank you.

38:52.547 --> 38:53.983
And to be honest,

38:54.027 --> 38:55.071
I'm really starting
to prefer this place

38:55.115 --> 38:56.290
to my humble abode.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.726
I don't suppose

38:57.770 --> 38:58.684
you have an extra bedroom
for your surrogate

38:58.727 --> 39:00.163
and baby-to-be?

39:01.164 --> 39:02.644
I've got 14.

39:14.787 --> 39:16.571
Well, this is a surprise.

39:16.615 --> 39:18.094
I've been thinking,

39:18.138 --> 39:20.401
and I'd like to get
that dinner after all.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.534
And perhaps I owe you
an apology.

39:23.709 --> 39:24.971
Why don't you come in?

39:25.014 --> 39:28.278
I, uh, I have
better wine this time.

39:33.066 --> 39:34.241
What's all this?

39:34.284 --> 39:36.417
Ammunition.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.419
I realized if I want to win,

39:38.463 --> 39:40.769
I have to speak the only
language Blake knows.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.598
Money.

39:46.732 --> 39:48.081
Hello, Atlanta.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.606

41:02.111 --> 41:04.244
You should've seen
the look on his face.

41:04.287 --> 41:06.072
I broke him.

41:06.115 --> 41:08.335
I'm proud of you.
I know it wasn't easy

41:08.378 --> 41:10.206
to stay above water
with Ben around.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.557
A lot of painful memories.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.297
I couldn't have done it
without your steady hand.

41:14.341 --> 41:16.430
And I wasn't always above water.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.477
Thankfully,
we're done with all of it.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.608
Who are you?

41:20.652 --> 41:22.349
Are you Mr. Blake Carrington?

41:23.742 --> 41:25.483
Yes, I'm Blake Carrington.

41:25.526 --> 41:28.094
- You've been served.
- Yeah. Right.

41:33.055 --> 41:34.317
Blake?

41:34.361 --> 41:36.276
- What is it?
- That bastard.

41:36.319 --> 41:40.106
He's claiming he was illegally
cut out of Thomas's will.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.282
He wants half.

41:42.325 --> 41:44.806
Half of what?

41:44.850 --> 41:45.938
Of everything we have.
