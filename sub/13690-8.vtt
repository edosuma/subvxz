00:05.133 --> 00:07.385
HECTOR: Come on,
I'm only obeying orders.

00:07.468 --> 00:08.886
ARCHIE: Not right now,
Father, please.

00:08.970 --> 00:10.555
In your very interesting
lecture, "Glenbogle,

00:10.638 --> 00:13.099
The Business", you said,
and I quote,

00:13.182 --> 00:16.102
"Good
communication is at the heart
of every thriving enterprise."

00:16.184 --> 00:17.854
-So...
-When I get back, okay?

00:17.937 --> 00:19.814
There's a spot of
damp in the wine cellar.

00:19.897 --> 00:23.443
I thought it imperative you be
informed without delay.
Thank you very much.

00:25.445 --> 00:27.155
Archie.

00:27.238 --> 00:29.657
I can't stop.
I've gotta get
Justine from the airport.

00:29.741 --> 00:31.409
Well, when you get back,
I want to talk to you about

00:31.492 --> 00:33.453
your responsibilities
as a landlord.

00:33.536 --> 00:36.664
I've just been to see some of
your properties and they're in
a terrible state.

00:36.748 --> 00:39.792
Great. Another conversation
to look forward to.

00:51.846 --> 00:53.681
Justine, how are you?

00:55.058 --> 00:57.393
Let's just get this
over with, shall we?

01:41.437 --> 01:43.815
(DOOR OPENING)

01:43.898 --> 01:46.693
HECTOR: Right. Careful.

01:52.197 --> 01:57.453
GOLLY: Damp, you said.
HECTOR: Yes.
Dear, oh, dear. Here we are.

01:57.537 --> 02:02.709
What have we here?
Ho, ho, we're in luck.

02:02.792 --> 02:05.962
Chateau Lafite '55.
Marvellous.

02:15.763 --> 02:18.516
ARCHIE: Would you
have come to Glenbogle?

02:20.059 --> 02:22.645
-To live?
-Mmm-hmm.

02:22.729 --> 02:25.147
Are you asking me to?

02:25.231 --> 02:26.816
I just wanted to know.

02:28.776 --> 02:30.486
A hypothetical question.

02:32.405 --> 02:35.825
No, Archie, I wouldn't.
My life's in London.

02:37.910 --> 02:39.245
My family,

02:40.329 --> 02:41.706
my friends,

02:42.749 --> 02:44.000
my work.

02:45.710 --> 02:47.003
Our work.

02:48.838 --> 02:50.048
Right.

02:51.382 --> 02:53.718
And Glenbogle's not for me.

02:53.801 --> 02:59.474
Your father's right,
I'd never make a laird's
wife in a million years.

02:59.556 --> 03:03.436
In any case,
you have plenty of
other candidates, don't you?

03:04.896 --> 03:08.900
Oh, I don't suppose
he'll remember, never does.

03:08.983 --> 03:12.570
Sorry, as you were.
He did remember our 25th.

03:13.446 --> 03:15.448
Even gave me a gift.

03:15.531 --> 03:19.660
The collected works
of Sir Walter Scott
bound in deerskin.

03:19.744 --> 03:21.662
Which sadly
wasn't properly cured

03:21.746 --> 03:25.875
and the dogs tore
it to bits one day
in a wild, animalistic frenzy.

03:28.336 --> 03:31.631
I'm going to be
leaving Glenbogle, Lexie.

03:31.714 --> 03:35.343
I've been offered a job
as an exotic
dancer in Las Vegas.

03:36.427 --> 03:37.512
Have you?

03:39.013 --> 03:40.306
What did you say?

03:42.058 --> 03:43.976
I wonder how
Archie's getting on?

03:45.937 --> 03:48.898
Aye. Poor Archie.

04:01.911 --> 04:06.708
If you're staying at
Glenbogle, I want to buy out
your share of the restaurant.

04:06.791 --> 04:08.584
What?

04:08.668 --> 04:10.378
I've had a valuation,

04:10.461 --> 04:13.423
leasehold, stock,
name, goodwill, the lot.

04:15.216 --> 04:18.052
A hundred and thirty thousand.

04:18.136 --> 04:23.182
-And you have
investors to put up the money?
-My family.

04:23.266 --> 04:26.728
-And Lennie
wants to buy a share.
-Lennie?

04:26.811 --> 04:30.189
-He's a terrific chef.
-And a bit of
a dish himself, yes?

04:31.607 --> 04:33.192
What do you say?

04:35.695 --> 04:38.656
Well, I'd like a few
days to think it over,
if that's all right.

04:38.740 --> 04:41.659
WOMAN ON PA:
...7947 to London Gatwick.

04:41.743 --> 04:43.661
Would all passengers...

04:43.745 --> 04:45.455
I'd better go.

04:45.538 --> 04:47.665
That's the first call for
British Airways flight...

04:47.749 --> 04:50.752
-Archie.
-...7947 to London Gatwick.

04:50.835 --> 04:54.505
I'd like nothing better
than for you to turn me down.

04:54.589 --> 04:59.802
Say,
"No, I'm leaving Glenbogle,
coming back to London."

05:02.096 --> 05:03.681
I want you, Archie.

05:05.058 --> 05:08.311
And I want our future back.

05:08.394 --> 05:13.983
British Airways announces the
departure of flight 7947
to London Gatwick.

05:14.067 --> 05:16.194
I'll call you
after the weekend.

05:26.871 --> 05:27.997
Come home.

05:42.553 --> 05:43.971
Look at my husband.

05:45.473 --> 05:48.184
A man who turned
idleness into an art form.

05:50.269 --> 05:51.979
I brought you some tea.

05:52.063 --> 05:55.441
-MOLLY: Ah, thank you, Duncan.
-And I got you
some diggies as well.

05:55.525 --> 05:58.985
Sweet boy.
You're too good to me.

05:59.070 --> 06:03.700
-Um, Lexie, are you, um...
-You look hot, Dunc.

06:03.783 --> 06:06.869
Why don't you go and
take a dip in our new pool
and cool off?

06:06.953 --> 06:10.039
Pool? Och, aye.

06:10.123 --> 06:13.292
I can't wait to
see Archie's face
when he finds out about that.

06:20.133 --> 06:22.051
(PHONE RINGING)

06:24.762 --> 06:27.515
-Hello?
-ALAN:
Katrina, it's your man here.

06:27.598 --> 06:29.350
Oh, Alan.

06:29.434 --> 06:31.185
Oh, I'm sorry it's not
Scotland's first minister

06:31.269 --> 06:33.229
offering you a seat in
his Cabinet.

06:33.312 --> 06:36.941
Listen, I was thinking
I might come up this weekend.

06:37.025 --> 06:40.194
-I'm sorry but...
-Oh, come on, sweetheart.

06:40.278 --> 06:42.697
Alan, just because you
helped me with the election

06:42.780 --> 06:45.575
and then in
a moment of gratitude
after a few drinks...

06:45.658 --> 06:47.869
You snogged me, yes.

06:47.952 --> 06:51.789
It doesn't mean we've suddenly
ignited a wild passion, okay?

06:51.873 --> 06:55.543
-Don't make assumptions.
-Of course not, no.

06:55.626 --> 06:57.962
Did the flowers
arrive by the way?

06:58.046 --> 07:02.342
Yes. And they're
very nice, thank you.

07:02.425 --> 07:05.928
-Look, Alan I've
got to go, okay? Bye.
-Okay, but listen...

07:12.727 --> 07:17.023
-Are you, er, on your own?
-Yes. Why?

07:17.106 --> 07:20.985
I just thought maybe
your friend might be here.

07:21.069 --> 07:26.115
-Alan lives in Edinburgh,
not here.
-I see.

07:26.199 --> 07:29.786
Look,
Katrina, I have to decide
what I'm going to do.

07:31.204 --> 07:33.706
Whether to stay,
whether to go.

07:33.790 --> 07:38.920
And whatever I do,
I'm going to
hurt someone a lot.

07:39.003 --> 07:43.257
-My parents or Justine...
-What do you want, Archie?

07:43.341 --> 07:46.344
Well, that's just it. I
can't begin to consider that.

07:46.427 --> 07:50.807
Every time I think about what
I want, I see the look on
their faces when I tell them.

07:53.559 --> 07:56.562
Listen, Archie, and I'm
talking man-to-man here...

07:56.646 --> 07:58.356
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

07:58.439 --> 08:00.650
Sorry. Hang on a sec.

08:06.364 --> 08:07.699
KATRINA: Alan.

08:08.991 --> 08:10.743
ALAN: Surprise, surprise.

08:19.419 --> 08:23.464
Ah. I've been saving
this Lafite for years.

08:23.548 --> 08:26.009
My father laid it
down in '55, you know.

08:26.092 --> 08:28.469
And he knocked it
back in '56, I'll bet.

08:29.429 --> 08:31.848
Now, um, I'd like it here,

08:31.931 --> 08:34.892
in full view of the house,
with the waters
of the loch behind.

08:34.976 --> 08:37.812
-Message
received and understood?
-Roger and out.

08:37.895 --> 08:40.313
Mind you, Archie will
put the kibosh on it
if he gets wind.

08:40.398 --> 08:43.192
-Careless talk costs lives.
-Absolutely.

08:43.275 --> 08:47.113
Now, what about the ground?
Is it a bit,
um, bit uneven do you think?

08:50.825 --> 08:53.077
Hector? What are you doing?

08:55.163 --> 08:58.081
Doing? Nothing,
darling. Nothing at all.

08:58.166 --> 09:03.004
The pair of you look
like Mr and Mrs Mussolini
after a night on the Chianti.

09:03.087 --> 09:05.089
Well, you know, dear, when a
couple of old sweats from the

09:05.173 --> 09:07.300
Cameron Highlanders
get together,

09:07.383 --> 09:09.677
they're bound to
start reminiscing.

09:09.761 --> 09:11.596
Is that right, Golly?

09:11.679 --> 09:14.891
Ah, sorry,
I can only reveal my name,
rank and serial number.

09:14.974 --> 09:16.976
Anyway, Archie's nearly here.

09:17.060 --> 09:19.812
He's just been spotted
passing the llama farm.

09:19.896 --> 09:24.108
What do you want us for?
Guard of honour? Shall I
rustle up a brass band?

09:24.192 --> 09:26.652
He's been to see Justine.

09:26.736 --> 09:29.530
About their future.
His future.

09:30.531 --> 09:31.741
Our future.

09:34.994 --> 09:38.289
And all because
the lady loves.

09:38.373 --> 09:40.458
Alan, I've told you!

09:40.541 --> 09:43.878
I was going to abseil down the
chimney but I thought I might
get soot on my strides.

09:43.961 --> 09:47.006
I don't want nut clusters!

09:47.090 --> 09:49.926
I want peace and quiet!

09:50.009 --> 09:54.055
-And personal space.
-I love your anger.

09:54.138 --> 09:56.265
Sends shivers
through my vitals.

10:03.272 --> 10:04.607
Hello?

10:16.828 --> 10:20.331
-Hi.
-Hello, darling.

10:20.415 --> 10:23.042
-Back again, then.
-Laddie.

10:23.126 --> 10:25.169
Old jalopy keep
you going okay, then?

10:26.462 --> 10:28.840
You must be tired, wee man.

10:28.923 --> 10:31.801
-Oh, thanks, Lexie.
-My pleasure.

10:33.678 --> 10:36.764
-So...
-How's Justine, then?

10:36.848 --> 10:39.267
And that cafeteria of yours?

10:40.101 --> 10:42.770
-Well...
-MAN: Yoo-hoo!

10:42.854 --> 10:45.690
-Well, the thing is, I...
-MAN: Anybody home?

10:45.773 --> 10:47.567
I know that voice.

10:47.650 --> 10:48.776
Ta-da!

10:48.860 --> 10:51.237
-Gosh,
how are you, banker man?
-Oh my.

10:51.320 --> 10:55.658
-Not that daft gowk again.
-Hello, one and all.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.452
What are you doing here?

10:57.535 --> 11:00.371
Just had a meeting in
Aberdeen. Thought I'd
pop over, you know.

11:00.455 --> 11:03.666
Look at you, Flem. The gear.

11:03.750 --> 11:08.129
I know, cost me a fortune.
But I thought I'd be
properly dressed this time.

11:08.212 --> 11:10.590
Look, this watch has got
a compass underneath it.

11:10.673 --> 11:12.175
That'll come in handy when
you're trying to find the

11:12.258 --> 11:14.385
bathroom in the
middle of the night.

11:14.469 --> 11:18.431
So, another inspection
by our favourite
financial advisor, is it?

11:18.514 --> 11:21.934
-Have you come to
give us the once over?
-I very much hope so, Lexie.

11:22.018 --> 11:23.227
(SNORTING)

11:24.645 --> 11:26.731
Oh, hello, Duncan.

11:26.814 --> 11:29.817
Mr Fleming, you must
stay for the weekend.

11:29.901 --> 11:31.444
(DUNCAN SIGHING)

11:34.322 --> 11:40.036
FLEMING: And the sporting side
and paying guests are starting
to produce a decent income.

11:40.119 --> 11:42.163
You're almost
not making a loss.

11:43.289 --> 11:45.208
-Well done.
-Thanks.

11:48.002 --> 11:52.548
But, um, you didn't
really have a meeting
in Aberdeen, did you?

11:54.425 --> 11:57.178
No.

11:57.261 --> 12:00.890
The thing is,
I've tried to
protect you from the bank.

12:00.973 --> 12:05.061
My boss just found out that
I'd let you increase that
whacking great debt of yours.

12:06.604 --> 12:09.565
-He went bananas.
-Oh, dear.

12:09.649 --> 12:11.484
I hope we haven't
got you into trouble.

12:11.567 --> 12:13.986
Oh, no, no. No.

12:15.071 --> 12:17.699
No, um...

12:17.782 --> 12:22.036
But now he wants blood
and if he can't have
bucketfuls of yours...

12:23.079 --> 12:25.123
he'll make do with mine.

12:26.290 --> 12:27.542
I see.

12:29.460 --> 12:33.756
Sorry, Archie, but I'm afraid
you need to produce
a wedge of dosh now

12:33.840 --> 12:35.550
for me to take back to London.

12:40.013 --> 12:41.681
I'm, um...

12:41.764 --> 12:44.475
I'm thinking of selling out
my share in the restaurant.

12:46.102 --> 12:48.521
Is that entirely wise?

12:48.604 --> 12:50.815
Sink all your capital into
these old stones?

12:50.898 --> 12:52.692
Well,
who else is going to do it?

12:53.735 --> 12:56.029
Fair point.

12:56.112 --> 12:58.489
All the same, radical step.

12:59.615 --> 13:01.868
No going back.

13:01.951 --> 13:06.748
I'd appreciate it if you kept
it to yourself. I haven't made
my mind up just yet.

13:09.751 --> 13:12.253
(HECTOR HUMMING)

13:12.337 --> 13:14.756
(DOOR OPENING)

13:14.839 --> 13:18.843
ARCHIE: It's either more
income or less expenditure and
I can't see how to do either.

13:18.926 --> 13:20.887
Why don't you
realise some assets?

13:20.970 --> 13:23.473
-What assets?
-I don't know.

13:23.556 --> 13:25.683
Like flogging off some
cottages in the village that

13:25.767 --> 13:27.810
you let for two and
thrupenny a week.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.146
What, sell the village?

13:30.229 --> 13:32.982
Still, Archie, at least
the fabric of this place
is in reasonable nick.

Ah, memo to Chief Executive
of Glenbogle Enterprises Inc.

of damp in wine and spirits

13:48.164 --> 13:50.792
Admirable aptitude
for understatement,
your father.

14:01.010 --> 14:04.597
-Oh, here, I'll take that.
-Oh, thanks, wee man.

14:04.681 --> 14:07.642
I know I give you
a hard time sometimes.

14:07.725 --> 14:09.060
I'm sorry.

14:10.395 --> 14:11.896
You're a sweetie.

14:23.199 --> 14:27.620
Boss? Boss?
Can I have a word of advice?

14:27.704 --> 14:29.580
From me? You must be joking.

14:30.707 --> 14:32.583
I'm sorry, what is it?

14:32.667 --> 14:35.753
Well, the thing is...

14:35.837 --> 14:39.882
if you cared for someone
but you never ever
thought that she cared back...

14:39.966 --> 14:42.010
Uh-huh.

14:42.093 --> 14:43.886
And then she started
being nice to you...

14:43.970 --> 14:48.099
I mean, really, really nice.
No more sniping,
no cracks or jokes.

14:48.182 --> 14:51.185
What would you think?

14:51.269 --> 14:55.440
I'd think that it was my
lucky day. That maybe she'd
seen the real me.

14:55.523 --> 14:58.276
-Maybe even fallen
a little bit in...
-You really think?

14:58.359 --> 15:01.529
-MAN: Mr MacDonald?
-Coming.

15:04.407 --> 15:07.660
In love with... Lexie!

15:10.079 --> 15:11.164
Duncan?

15:13.249 --> 15:17.128
Lexie,
darling, I fancy you rot...

15:17.211 --> 15:18.296
No.

15:22.050 --> 15:26.512
I'm sweet on you
and I really...

15:26.596 --> 15:30.433
You know, and I think
that you may be just a bit...

15:34.145 --> 15:35.688
So why don't me and you...

15:35.772 --> 15:38.316
(LEXIE AND FLEMING LAUGHING)

15:41.736 --> 15:45.198
No, my dear Lexie, till you
came along,

15:45.281 --> 15:48.242
life was pretty barren
on the femininity front.

15:48.326 --> 15:50.203
You must have had girlfriends,
though.

15:50.286 --> 15:53.539
Careful with your plurals,
hope of my heart.

15:53.623 --> 15:56.501
Well, what was she like?
Was she pretty?

15:57.794 --> 16:00.088
She looked a bit like...

16:00.171 --> 16:03.549
Do you know a football manager
called Harry Redknapp?

16:03.633 --> 16:07.095
My dad used to
say about my gran,
"I'm not saying she's ugly,

16:07.178 --> 16:11.432
"but when she puts her
make-up on the lipstick starts
backing up into the tube."

16:13.434 --> 16:15.186
But listen, Flem,

16:15.269 --> 16:19.107
I mean,
you're funny, young...ish,

16:19.190 --> 16:22.402
good job,
if a bit on the dull side,

16:23.653 --> 16:25.988
quite nice looking.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.700
-What's the problem here?
-You tell me.

16:28.783 --> 16:30.660
It's just...

16:30.743 --> 16:34.038
When I meet girls,
they seem to take
an instant dislike to me.

16:34.122 --> 16:37.375
-Why, I've no idea.
-Maybe it just saves time.

16:37.458 --> 16:38.626
Beg your pardon?

16:38.710 --> 16:40.086
(LEXIE LAUGHING)

16:40.169 --> 16:42.964
Flem, you're good for me.

16:43.047 --> 16:46.676
That, my dear,
is my main purpose in life.

16:46.759 --> 16:48.553
So, you enjoyed
your trip to London?

16:48.636 --> 16:53.224
-Mmm. Amazing. Far too short.
-We'll put that
right next time.

16:56.519 --> 16:59.439
I was very upset you
didn't come and see me.

16:59.522 --> 17:02.400
-And how are we
going to get rid of it?
-Pump it all out.

17:02.483 --> 17:05.069
Lay some drains
from here to the loch.

17:05.153 --> 17:08.239
Put in a pump that
kicks in automatically
when it rains.

17:08.321 --> 17:09.574
Fairly simple.

17:10.575 --> 17:14.328
-Right.
-So far.

17:14.412 --> 17:15.872
There is something else.

17:17.749 --> 17:20.251
-Look at this.
-What is it?

17:20.335 --> 17:22.627
Crack in load-bearing wall.

17:23.628 --> 17:26.424
-Subsidence.
-Oh, no.

17:26.507 --> 17:28.926
I'll need to inspect
the rest of the house.

17:29.010 --> 17:33.097
And you'd better go and do
what people always do in these
unfortunate situations.

17:35.433 --> 17:39.312
-I must be the biggest
booby in Glenbogle.
-What?

17:39.395 --> 17:41.439
I should have known.

17:41.522 --> 17:45.777
She goes down to London her
usual scratchy self and comes
back like Mary Poppins.

17:45.859 --> 17:48.780
-Not now, Duncan.
-And who lives in London?

17:48.863 --> 17:50.615
That little banker.

17:52.365 --> 17:55.285
-He's had his way with her.
-Here we are.

17:55.370 --> 18:00.166
I've just heard them,
cooing on to each other
like a couple of rock doves.

18:00.249 --> 18:02.001
He's wrecked my life.

18:02.085 --> 18:05.962
-But I'll have my revenge,
you'll see.
-Right.

18:07.548 --> 18:10.051
You don't think she
loves him, do you?

18:10.927 --> 18:14.013
Oh, horrible. Horrible!

18:18.059 --> 18:21.062
Okay, right. Just tell
me things can't get any...

18:24.607 --> 18:30.279
SURVEYOR: Here, here and here.

18:31.656 --> 18:33.741
You haven't noticed?

18:33.825 --> 18:37.662
There are 43 rooms here.
I haven't been in some
of them since I was a boy.

18:37.745 --> 18:40.498
Well, the evidence is
there for all to see.

18:40.581 --> 18:43.376
This whole wing of
the house is sinking fast.

18:43.459 --> 18:45.795
The place is unsafe.

18:45.878 --> 18:51.884
My strong advice is to
get everyone out and now,
while we get the builders in.

18:51.968 --> 18:55.722
-How much?
-Oh, I'm only a surveyor,
Mr MacDonald,

18:55.805 --> 18:59.308
but I don't think
you'll get much
change out of six figures.

18:59.392 --> 19:02.854
But don't worry,
in my experience the
insurance companies

19:02.937 --> 19:04.564
are very good with
this sort of thing.

19:04.647 --> 19:07.400
Well, they might be
if you still had
a policy with them.

19:07.483 --> 19:09.652
Oh dear, oh dear.

19:09.736 --> 19:12.864
Thank you for coming so
quickly, Mr Aitcheson,
I appreciate it.

19:29.047 --> 19:33.009
The commanding officer
of the food police sent me.

19:33.092 --> 19:34.886
She and Molly are concerned
you might fade away without

19:34.969 --> 19:36.763
immediate ingestion
of luncheon.

19:36.846 --> 19:38.264
(SNAPPING)

19:38.348 --> 19:39.474
Oh! Ah!

19:40.350 --> 19:41.684
That hurt.

19:43.978 --> 19:45.897
Something wrong?

19:45.980 --> 19:50.276
Just a small
problem of maintenance.

19:50.360 --> 19:54.947
I don't think the bank
can help out this time,
much as I'd like to.

19:55.031 --> 19:58.826
Should I sell out, Fleming?
You know,
my share of the restaurant?

19:59.702 --> 20:02.872
You could, but...

20:02.955 --> 20:06.626
Look,
Archie, I love this place,
but it's a black hole.

20:06.709 --> 20:10.588
Fleets of Â£50
notes are sent into it
and never seen again.

20:14.092 --> 20:15.551
I'd better rejoin the ladies.

21:00.013 --> 21:01.639
Hello, goodbye.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.031
Hey, lady of the lake,
how do you fancy
a spin around the loch?

21:18.114 --> 21:19.615
I can't, Captain Birds Eye.

21:19.699 --> 21:21.576
-I've got the dinner to cook.
-Oh.

21:21.659 --> 21:24.162
Thought I might have a go
after I've peeled
the spuds for you.

21:24.245 --> 21:26.873
Haven't played Swallows
and Amazons for years.

21:33.171 --> 21:35.381
Oh, Hector, this reminds me.

21:35.465 --> 21:39.302
I've been thinking
about our anniversary,
perhaps having a small party?

21:39.385 --> 21:40.803
Nonsense, darling.

21:40.887 --> 21:43.306
And who needs celebrations
when every day of our long...

21:43.389 --> 21:45.683
BOTH: ...and
apparently endless marriage

21:45.767 --> 21:47.727
...is like
the first day of spring, eh?

21:47.810 --> 21:49.729
Mother, Father,
I need to talk to you.

21:52.857 --> 21:57.236
I mean,
can't you just leave it?
It might just go away.

21:57.320 --> 22:00.323
It isn't safe to stay here.
We have to move out.

22:00.406 --> 22:04.202
-Temporarily, you mean,
while the builders fix it?
-Yes.

22:04.285 --> 22:08.122
-How very boring.
Not to say inconvenient.
-Hector.

22:08.206 --> 22:10.458
I suppose
Kilwillie could put us up
for a couple of weeks.

22:10.541 --> 22:12.001
There is something else.

22:13.670 --> 22:15.755
The bank are insisting that
we reduce the debt.

22:15.838 --> 22:17.632
Fleming can't hold them
off any longer.

22:19.258 --> 22:21.260
Oh dear.

22:21.344 --> 22:24.222
-Insurance policy
can't sort that one out.
-No.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.809
What are you
going to do, Archie?

22:29.936 --> 22:34.107
Well, when I saw Justine she
offered to buy me out of
the restaurant.

22:34.190 --> 22:37.735
Oh, Archie. You two
haven't split up, have you?

22:39.570 --> 22:41.698
It could solve our problems.

22:41.781 --> 22:43.491
-Well, some of them.
-Capital.

22:43.574 --> 22:46.828
-You mustn't.
You mustn't do this...
-It's not your concern, Molly.

than for you to
stay and settle here,

your own decision.

trust for his children
and grandchildren to come.

Please, don't argue.
It just makes it worse.

haven't resolved this business
about your tenants.

-Mrs McLeod's
kitchen's in an awful state...
-Can I just say something?

23:16.190 --> 23:18.109
She's got a damp patch
the size of the North Sea.

23:18.192 --> 23:21.863

You wanna see a damp patch?
I'll show you a damp patch.

-Yum.

So, perhaps we should
get our heads together
about what to take, Lexie.

25:20.064 --> 25:24.068
I must say,
I'm rather looking forward
to my little break.

25:24.152 --> 25:27.113
Though, I sometimes wish
I could make it permanent.

25:28.865 --> 25:31.492
It is seasoned, Hector.

25:31.576 --> 25:34.620
Archie, perhaps you'd tell
your father that it is
an insult to the cook

25:34.704 --> 25:37.749
to fling condiments
on a carefully
prepared dish like that.

25:37.832 --> 25:40.168
Archie, perhaps
you'd tell your mother
to mind her own business

25:40.251 --> 25:42.420
and keep her elegant
nose out of my dinner.

25:42.503 --> 25:43.838

25:55.058 --> 25:57.560

selling the village, Archie?

25:59.729 --> 26:01.356
Oh, yeah?

26:01.439 --> 26:04.734
I thought of someone
who might give
you a good price.

26:04.817 --> 26:06.903
What do you mean,
sell the village?

26:06.986 --> 26:10.198

A rather good client,
actually.

26:11.324 --> 26:13.201

26:13.284 --> 26:15.870
Your friend and
neighbour Kilwillie.

26:15.953 --> 26:17.747
Kilwillie?

26:17.830 --> 26:21.000
He said that that
land once belonged
to his family, Mr MacDonald,

26:21.084 --> 26:26.673
till yours stole
it with considerable
grievous bodily harm in 1588.

26:26.756 --> 26:29.425
He wants it back
and is happy to
pay big time for it.

26:29.509 --> 26:31.969

26:32.053 --> 26:35.264
-That can easily be arranged.
-Now look here...

26:37.517 --> 26:40.603
Mr Fleming, that
sounds an excellent idea.

has ruined my appetite.

though, isn't it?

on hearing bad
news immediately.

-Just a minute.

27:19.267 --> 27:21.936
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

27:23.855 --> 27:27.275
Just a bit of butchery.

27:30.319 --> 27:32.113
I'll be there in a minute.

Hi, sweetheart.

29:19.262 --> 29:21.681
I came to see you,
but you were on the phone.

29:21.764 --> 29:26.394
You only had muesli so I went
down the shops for some Sugar

-Would you stop blathering?

-Okay.
-And would you
look at this place.

come in here and...

-I live here, you know.
-Oh, really?

You've hardly been
in since I got here.

a cause-and-effect
relationship between the two.

-I never asked
you to come, Alan.
-I'm aware of that.

needed to see you.

begin to reciprocate.

30:07.268 --> 30:08.770
I'm sorry.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.820
I also came to
look at property.

buy a place here.

And flogging it to some
millionaire like it was
a rich man's plaything.

31:30.435 --> 31:34.897
Well, it's not. It's a living,
breathing community.

31:34.981 --> 31:38.526
And I demand you
discuss this mess
with me right now.

31:38.609 --> 31:40.111
With you?

31:40.194 --> 31:43.281
As a democratically
elected member
of the Highland Council.

31:43.364 --> 31:44.949
Ah, of course.

31:45.033 --> 31:47.952
But maybe, maybe you
could look at it this way.

31:48.036 --> 31:50.538
I am one of your constituents.
I have problems.

31:50.621 --> 31:54.417
Am I, therefore, not worthy of
your help, your sympathy,
your understanding?

31:54.500 --> 31:55.668
(HECTOR CLEARING THROAT)

31:55.752 --> 31:57.670
-What is it?
-Hector?

31:59.339 --> 32:02.342
Father?

32:02.425 --> 32:05.595
-What are you doing?
-Rooftop protest. What
those jailbirds get up to.

32:05.678 --> 32:08.556
What, on the balcony
outside my bedroom?

32:08.639 --> 32:10.600
I'm not coming down till
you come to your senses.

32:10.683 --> 32:14.395
This is childish,
even by your own
spectacular standards.

32:16.022 --> 32:18.608
You don't know the half
of this estate's problems.

32:18.691 --> 32:20.651
I'm taking no food.

32:20.735 --> 32:24.238
But ask Lexie to send up
another flask and some more
old Country Lifes.

32:27.241 --> 32:29.911
Duncan!

32:29.994 --> 32:33.873
The thing is, Lexie, when
it comes right down to it,

32:33.956 --> 32:36.042
all men are bampots.

32:36.125 --> 32:39.087
You'll be telling
me next Dolly Parton
has to sleep on her back.

32:39.170 --> 32:40.963
And definitely not
worth fighting over.

32:41.047 --> 32:44.926
No, but it's kind of nice
when they're
fighting over you.

32:45.009 --> 32:47.220
And what is Archie anyway?

32:47.303 --> 32:49.931
The sorry product of
centuries of inbreeding.

32:51.391 --> 32:53.351
You know the term "gene pool"?

32:53.434 --> 32:56.312
Isn't that where
Duncan washes his trousers?

32:56.396 --> 32:59.899
Well,
this family's been swimming
in a tiny one for too long.

32:59.982 --> 33:03.861
And the heir
apparent's sinking,
in more ways than one.

33:03.945 --> 33:09.617
Aye, they need some vigorous
working-class spermies to get
them going right enough.

33:09.701 --> 33:13.162
Speaking of which,
do you know how
Golly got his name?

33:14.414 --> 33:17.208
A woman down
the village told me.

33:17.291 --> 33:21.838
Apparently, one summer
years ago, when Hector could
afford more staff,

33:21.921 --> 33:25.174
Golly took a bonny
young lass to a dance,

33:25.258 --> 33:29.095
Gay Gordoned the stockings
off her and took her
down by the river.

33:29.178 --> 33:30.680
For a canoodle?

33:30.763 --> 33:33.182
One thing led to another,
as they do,

33:33.266 --> 33:37.603
she unbuttoned her frock,
he undid his...

33:37.687 --> 33:42.859
And she was so amazed,
so flabbergasted by
what confronted her,

33:42.942 --> 33:45.528
-she cried...
-Golly!

33:52.118 --> 33:53.870
What's up?

33:53.953 --> 33:55.580
(BOTH LAUGHING)

33:58.708 --> 34:00.668
Apart from the fact that
Mr Fleming represents the bank

34:00.752 --> 34:02.378
to which the estate
is indebted,

34:02.462 --> 34:04.464
he is in this
house as a guest.

34:04.547 --> 34:09.052
-Cuckoo in the nest, you mean.
-I also consider him a friend.

34:09.135 --> 34:10.803
Are you gonna sack me, then?

34:10.887 --> 34:13.348
No, of course not,
but you have to
apologise to him.

34:13.431 --> 34:14.931
-Oh, no.
-Yes.

34:15.016 --> 34:16.934
Oh, I'd rather cut
my own tongue out.

34:17.018 --> 34:18.770
Duncan, you're making
this very difficult.

34:19.687 --> 34:23.608
See... I'm fond of Lexie.

34:24.525 --> 34:26.569
Maybe you noticed.

34:26.652 --> 34:31.074
Anyway,
this fellow slimed his way in
and had a dalliance with her.

34:31.157 --> 34:32.533
Dalliance?

34:32.617 --> 34:36.996
She went down to London
to be with him and he... He...

34:37.080 --> 34:39.873
Och, I can hardly
bring myself to say, he...

34:39.956 --> 34:41.793
Despoiled her.

34:41.876 --> 34:45.295
-Of course he didn't.
She never even saw him.
-Well, how do you know?

34:45.380 --> 34:48.966
Because she was with me all
the time. I never let her
out of my sight.

34:49.050 --> 34:52.011
We even shared
a sleeper compartment
on the way home.

34:52.094 --> 34:55.681
-What?
-What?

34:55.764 --> 34:57.850
So it was you that was doing
the despoiling, was it?

34:57.934 --> 35:00.353
No, of course not. We never...

35:00.436 --> 35:02.188
Well, it was nothing really.

35:03.356 --> 35:04.941
What was nothing?

35:05.024 --> 35:09.404
-Well, I, we...
Well, we just...
-You dirty...

35:09.487 --> 35:11.906
How could you, Archie?
After all I've done for you.

35:11.989 --> 35:16.828
Right, that's it. I'm done
with this place. And you.

35:19.163 --> 35:21.332
I offer the hand of friendship

35:21.416 --> 35:25.503
and all I get back is
the tickle of cold steel
between the shoulder blades.

35:25.586 --> 35:27.714
Mr Fleming.

35:27.797 --> 35:30.049
May I tender my
sincere apologies?

35:31.551 --> 35:34.012
-Accepted, Duncan.
-Right.

35:34.095 --> 35:37.807
Let's you and me
leave this toe-rag
and go and get pished.

35:52.822 --> 35:54.323
Hello, Archie.

36:03.624 --> 36:06.127
-Mother...
-What's wrong?

36:08.463 --> 36:11.507
Why is it I can
never do anything right?

36:11.591 --> 36:15.219
Oh, my special child.

36:15.303 --> 36:19.598
Let me tell you something,
for me, you could
never do anything wrong.

36:23.226 --> 36:25.396
There's no
insurance policy, is there?

36:27.190 --> 36:29.317
The last premium wasn't paid.

36:29.400 --> 36:32.612
I have to find
a hundred thousand,
and that's just for starters.

36:32.695 --> 36:34.989
You tried to keep it
from us to protect us.

36:35.073 --> 36:36.657
Oh, what is it now?

36:36.741 --> 36:38.743
-Will somebody just explain?
-I said no.

36:38.826 --> 36:41.746
Duncan, for heaven's sake.
Fleming, please.

36:41.829 --> 36:45.124
I find I'm unable to
speak to you just now,
Alexandra.

36:48.252 --> 36:49.545
What?

36:49.629 --> 36:53.966
I, that is to say,
we, my friend Duncan and I,

36:54.050 --> 36:57.804
are disappointed,
nay, hurt, by your actions.

36:58.763 --> 37:00.181
What's going on down there?

37:01.557 --> 37:04.852
-Lexie...
-Archie, how could you?

37:04.936 --> 37:07.980
-Let me explain, I...
-Your father's right.

37:08.064 --> 37:11.275
You're a cad and a bounder.

37:11.359 --> 37:14.445
-Well, where are you going?
-I'm not gonna
speak to you ever again.

37:14.529 --> 37:16.197
At least not until
you make it right.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.074
Come on up, child.
What's going on?

37:18.157 --> 37:20.284
Oh, just the usual.
Everyone having fun
at your son's expense.

37:20.368 --> 37:23.162
-Archie.
-Not now, please.

37:23.246 --> 37:26.124
I'm not here to give you
unwanted advice. It's up to

37:26.207 --> 37:27.709
you what you do with
your life.

37:27.792 --> 37:30.420
It's got nothing to
do with me after all.

37:30.503 --> 37:34.590
-Eh?
-Except in so far as it
affects my constituents.

37:34.674 --> 37:36.926
-Katrina,
why don't you just shut up?
-What?

37:37.010 --> 37:40.346
As usual, you are speaking to
me with all the sympathy and
human understanding...

37:40.430 --> 37:41.723
You don't understand.

37:41.806 --> 37:43.057
I'm just trying to tell you...

37:43.141 --> 37:45.560
I am just like you, you know,
really.

37:45.643 --> 37:48.855
I have feelings, too.
If you prick me,
do I not bleed?

37:48.938 --> 37:50.440
Archie!

37:50.523 --> 37:53.067
Well, I've had enough, okay?
Why don't you just get lost!

37:54.068 --> 37:55.361
Archie, you...

38:00.199 --> 38:02.118
(HECTOR AND LEXIE APPLAUDING)

38:02.201 --> 38:06.539
-Hear, hear. Easy does it.
-LEXIE: Come away in.

38:06.622 --> 38:09.917
The Glenbogle Two
become the Glenbogle Three.

38:10.001 --> 38:12.337
-There we are. Good girl.
-Yeah.

38:12.420 --> 38:16.174
Now, Katrina, I've just read
a very interesting
article in Country Life

38:16.257 --> 38:18.051
about Scottish land reform.

38:22.930 --> 38:25.516
It's very hypnotic.
And soothing.

38:27.435 --> 38:29.604
Ah, Archie, I'm not...

38:29.687 --> 38:32.732
I'm not much of
a one for giving advice,

38:32.815 --> 38:37.487
aside of how to hold a gun
or caress
the water with a fly.

38:37.570 --> 38:39.989
I know nothing about business,

38:40.073 --> 38:42.200
nor even about
what people call love.

38:43.534 --> 38:48.539
But only thing I
can say to you is

38:48.623 --> 38:50.917
something I've
failed to do all my life.

38:52.627 --> 38:54.379
Follow your heart, son.

38:55.672 --> 38:57.006
Follow your heart.

39:01.094 --> 39:03.221
Always the same, Duncan.

39:03.304 --> 39:08.393
Disappointment.
Disillusion. Betrayal.

39:08.476 --> 39:11.688
She made toothpicks
from the timbers of my heart.

39:11.771 --> 39:14.691
The unchanging
pattern of my life.

39:14.774 --> 39:16.734
That's a country and
western song.

39:16.818 --> 39:21.614
-It's in Golly's collection.
-I know I'm not good-looking,
I know that.

39:21.698 --> 39:26.911
Get Your Tongue Out Of My
Mouth 'Cause I'm Kissing You
Goodbye. That's another.

39:26.994 --> 39:32.875
When I was born I was so ugly
the doctor slapped my mother.

39:32.959 --> 39:37.338
I liked Archie,
you know, trusted him,
had a real soft spot for him.

39:37.422 --> 39:41.551
I've still got one
in a trench in
the vegetable garden.

39:41.634 --> 39:44.262
All right, lads?
Can I buy you a drink?

39:45.680 --> 39:47.098
LEXIE: Nursery food's
coming up.

39:47.181 --> 39:49.809
I'll talk to as many
tenants as I can.

39:49.892 --> 39:51.477
Excellent. What about
sandwiches?

39:51.561 --> 39:53.604
Banana and chutney?
Chocks away.

39:53.688 --> 39:56.149
Oh, good,
I do love a 'nana sarnie.

40:02.655 --> 40:05.158
(SLURRING) I need
to get my things.

40:05.241 --> 40:08.953
-I'll give you
a lift to the station.
-No, you won't.

40:09.037 --> 40:11.330
You're as squiffy
as 60 billy goats.

40:14.751 --> 40:17.337
WOMAN: Thank you, dear.

40:17.420 --> 40:20.715
Spare me the glassy,
meaningless
smile of the drunk.

40:22.592 --> 40:24.177
Marry me.

40:24.260 --> 40:27.096
-What?
-It's crazy but it might work.

40:27.180 --> 40:28.931
Why would I marry you, Alan?

40:29.015 --> 40:32.518
Because I'm mad about you.
Because I love you.

40:32.602 --> 40:35.104
Because I want to
have your babies.

40:35.188 --> 40:37.940
Well, I'm not sure
about that last bit.

40:38.024 --> 40:40.693
I'm sorry but
the answer is no.

40:40.777 --> 40:43.780
-Anyway, you're drunk.
-I'm not drunk.

40:43.863 --> 40:45.907
And I meant what I said.

40:45.990 --> 40:48.910
Inside this tough,
manly exterior,

40:48.993 --> 40:53.498
my heart is bursting
with an intense
longing for you.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.166
Alan...

40:55.249 --> 41:00.546
that's very sweet and
I'm very fond of you,

41:00.630 --> 41:05.802
but I don't love you.
How can I marry you
if I don't love you?

41:05.885 --> 41:10.139
Got the hots for
someone else, is that it?
Your tame aristo?

41:10.223 --> 41:13.559
Oh, aye, he's such a nice guy.

41:13.643 --> 41:16.229
But I hear he's
reverted to type.

41:16.312 --> 41:19.899
Having his way with the staff
like so many of his forebears.

41:19.982 --> 41:23.319
-Alan...
-I don't know what
the radical feminist line is

41:23.403 --> 41:25.780
on that kind of hanky-panky,

41:25.863 --> 41:29.325
but it reeks of the worst kind
of sexual exploitation to me.

41:29.409 --> 41:31.703
Thank you, but I already knew.

41:31.786 --> 41:34.497
Katrina, you know,

41:34.580 --> 41:39.043
you're one of those women
who just can't work
out what they want,

41:39.127 --> 41:43.881
but they're nevertheless
prepared to fight to
the death to get it.

41:43.965 --> 41:46.259
Goodbye, Alan.

41:49.762 --> 41:51.264
(HISSING)

41:56.644 --> 41:58.563
-Positive reaction.
-Excellent.

41:58.646 --> 42:02.734
Now we can deal
with the money side.
Ah, banker chappie.

42:02.817 --> 42:05.820
Duncan, convey
the abacus operative up here,
would you?

42:22.170 --> 42:25.298
Justine. It's me.

42:25.381 --> 42:27.508
That's fine,
just give it to me ball park.

42:27.592 --> 42:29.552
-There he is.
-FLEMING: I'll call you back.

42:29.635 --> 42:30.970
HECTOR: Turncoat.

42:31.054 --> 42:32.722
DUNCAN: Unclean.
LEXIE: Archie out!

42:32.805 --> 42:36.601
ALL: (CHANTING)
Archie out!
Archie out! Archie out!

42:36.684 --> 42:40.229
ARCHIE:
Come on, just be quiet!

42:40.313 --> 42:43.441
Now, would you all come down,
please? I have a few
things to say to you.

42:49.405 --> 42:52.241
Hector. What's going on?
These men...

42:52.325 --> 42:54.118
I thought you weren't
speaking to me.

42:54.202 --> 42:57.955
Don't worry,
Golly will deal with them,
my heart's desire.

43:04.295 --> 43:07.548
Well,
we await His Master's voice.

43:11.761 --> 43:13.096
Right.

43:14.764 --> 43:17.975
Since I came back to Glenbogle
a couple of centuries ago,

43:18.059 --> 43:21.729
I seem, at various times,
to have angered, irritated,

43:21.813 --> 43:23.523
disappointed and hurt

43:23.606 --> 43:26.567
some,
most, maybe even all of you.

43:28.611 --> 43:31.698
I'd especially like to
apologise to you, Lexie.

43:31.781 --> 43:34.659
I'm mortified at the thought
that I might have hurt you,

43:34.742 --> 43:37.662
because over the
past few weeks and months
I've come to see just

43:37.745 --> 43:40.081
what a special girl you are.

43:40.164 --> 43:42.375
Thanks, Arch.

43:42.458 --> 43:45.294
And before anyone else does
a simple sum
with that sentence

43:45.378 --> 43:48.214
and comes up with
a figure approaching
the size of our overdraft,

43:48.297 --> 43:52.051
let me say that
nothing has happened
between us that I'm ashamed of

43:52.135 --> 43:54.762
or that warrants any
explanation to anyone.

43:54.846 --> 43:59.017
Katrina, I'd like to thank you
for your unwavering help,

43:59.100 --> 44:03.021
especially your fascinating
lectures on the major
political issues of the day.

44:03.104 --> 44:07.525
I'm sorry if I haven't
always seemed grateful
but you know what they say,

44:07.608 --> 44:10.862
asking a voter what he
thinks about politicians
is a bit like asking

44:10.945 --> 44:13.614
lampposts what
they think about dogs.

44:13.698 --> 44:17.535
-Nice one, Archie.
-I hope I'll always
have your support,

44:17.618 --> 44:19.454
maybe even your respect,

44:19.537 --> 44:25.209
despite my status as
resident feudal relic
and pet punchbag.

44:25.293 --> 44:30.131
Maybe the fact that
I'm not selling out to
Kilwillie will be a start.

44:30.214 --> 44:32.675
What are you going to do?

44:32.759 --> 44:35.553
Mother, Father,

44:35.636 --> 44:38.890
I've just spoken to Justine
and I've accepted her offer

44:38.973 --> 44:40.725
for my share of the
restaurant.

44:40.808 --> 44:43.061
-I'll use the money to
pay for the underpinning.
-But...

44:43.144 --> 44:45.938
And start repaying
the debt to the bank.

44:46.022 --> 44:49.650
That way we can all get on
with the job of
making Glenbogle viable.

44:49.734 --> 44:53.404
Giving it, and us, a future.

44:53.488 --> 44:57.241
-That's my boy.
-Archie,
darling, are you sure?

44:57.325 --> 45:00.370
Not really, no. But, um...

45:01.454 --> 45:04.665
it just seemed right.

45:04.749 --> 45:07.251
But whatever happens,
I'm gonna make a go of it.

45:07.335 --> 45:11.506
And I hope you'll all help me.
And I hope you'll
all be my friends.

45:11.589 --> 45:14.050
Well said. Damn well said.

45:19.597 --> 45:21.808
You don't have to
blow your money,

45:21.891 --> 45:25.061
and you don't have to
sell out to Kilwillie either.

45:25.144 --> 45:27.980
You could make a lot of people
very happy instead.

45:28.064 --> 45:33.111
-Well, how do you mean?
-We've hatched a plan.
All of us.

45:33.194 --> 45:36.739
You can sell
the properties in the village
to the tenants.

45:36.823 --> 45:39.158
Tenants? Could they afford it?

45:39.242 --> 45:42.912
They can get help from the
government under the new
land legislation.

45:42.995 --> 45:45.039
And we've lined up
mortgages already.

45:46.124 --> 45:47.875
Fleming?

45:47.959 --> 45:49.752
Well,
it's going to help the bank
get its money back, Archie.

45:49.836 --> 45:52.422
It's the perfect
solution for everybody,

45:52.505 --> 45:54.590
and it's good
for the community.

45:54.674 --> 45:58.594
-And good for the estate.
-And for you, Archie.

45:58.678 --> 46:02.890
And it keeps your
options open with Justine.

46:05.184 --> 46:08.312
-Everybody's happy.
-Apart from Kilwillie.

46:10.690 --> 46:14.652
By the way, this was
all your father's idea.

46:14.736 --> 46:16.487
You?

46:16.571 --> 46:18.823
It's what I keep
telling you, Archie.

46:18.906 --> 46:22.035
One simply must
move with the times.

46:28.750 --> 46:30.793
HECTOR: This way, everybody.

46:32.420 --> 46:35.715
Ladies and gentlemen,
I ask you to
charge your glasses.

46:35.798 --> 46:37.759
I'd like to propose a toast

46:37.842 --> 46:42.930
to the loveliest
girl in the Highlands,
my dear wife of 40 years.

46:43.014 --> 46:45.433
-To Molly.
-ALL: To Molly.

46:49.645 --> 46:53.399
Thank you, Duncan.
Gentlemen, do your worst!

47:08.790 --> 47:10.625
Happy, darling?

47:15.713 --> 47:17.590
(ALL CHEERING)

47:20.843 --> 47:26.265
-Thank you, Golly.
-Happy anniversary,
you sentimental old fool.

47:26.349 --> 47:29.644
I wanted to buy you a ruby
but
the fireworks were cheaper.

47:36.401 --> 47:37.652
Splendid.

47:42.782 --> 47:44.659
FLEMING: Thanks, Golly.

47:46.661 --> 47:49.706
Well, Archie MacDonald,

47:49.789 --> 47:53.334
-thank you very much
for your kind words.
-Oh, I meant them.

47:55.586 --> 47:59.215
You haven't really
fallen for this miserable
specimen before you, have you?

47:59.298 --> 48:03.636
What, me? You? Don't be daft.

48:03.720 --> 48:07.390
What do you think I am? But...

48:07.473 --> 48:10.226
I will tell you this,
Archie MacDonald,

48:10.309 --> 48:13.604
one of these fine days
me and you are gonna finish
what we started.

48:18.234 --> 48:22.447
All right.
Come on, boys, let's party.

48:22.530 --> 48:24.490
And no fighting.

48:24.574 --> 48:25.908
Here you are.

48:28.161 --> 48:31.164
You have to come down
to the village tomorrow.

48:31.247 --> 48:34.459
I think your soon-to-be
ex-tenants would like to
thank you in person.

48:34.542 --> 48:38.671
Mrs McLeod actually said
she was sorry to be
getting her own place.

48:38.755 --> 48:42.216
"Lairds have
been looking after
my families for centuries."

48:42.300 --> 48:45.053
-She was nearly crying.
-How sweet.

48:45.136 --> 48:47.805
Demeaning more like.
In the new Scotland there's...

48:47.889 --> 48:51.517
Katrina, put another record
on, will you? I've heard this
one so many times

48:51.601 --> 48:54.604
-I could sing it myself.
-Listen here, matey...

48:54.687 --> 48:56.647
No, you listen.

48:56.731 --> 48:59.525
I wanna thank you
for what you did.

48:59.609 --> 49:04.614
For me and Justine.
It was very generous of you.

49:04.697 --> 49:07.325
I suppose, in a way,
the other way
would have been easier.

49:07.408 --> 49:12.205
The decision was made for me.
Burn my boats in
London and settle here.

49:12.288 --> 49:14.665
But now,
I have to decide for myself.

49:17.251 --> 49:19.003
What to do about
me and Justine.

49:20.463 --> 49:22.006
What to do about me and you.

49:24.133 --> 49:25.259
Oh?

49:26.928 --> 49:29.430
Is there such
a thing as me and you?

49:33.893 --> 49:35.770
(CAR APPROACHING)

49:38.523 --> 49:40.024
ARCHIE: Justine?

49:50.535 --> 49:51.911
I had to come.

49:52.745 --> 49:54.497
I felt so desolate.

49:56.249 --> 49:57.792
I can't lose you, Archie.

49:59.752 --> 50:01.295
Maybe I can change.

50:02.672 --> 50:05.633
Maybe I can come and
live here with you.

50:07.135 --> 50:09.053
Make our lives here.

50:11.389 --> 50:13.266
What do you think?
