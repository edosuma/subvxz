00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
The usual, m'Lord.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.700
Good morning, m'Lord.

01:13.096 --> 01:14.176
The morning paper, m'Lord.

01:20.360 --> 01:24.612
Ah Sir Robert Chiltern
a rising star in Parliament...

01:24.647 --> 01:29.255
tonight hosts a party that promises to
be the highlight of the social calendar...

01:29.290 --> 01:31.684
Er, with his wife Lady Gertrude...

01:31.719 --> 01:35.175
who is herself a leading figure
in women's politics.

01:35.210 --> 01:36.004
Together...

01:36.039 --> 01:40.327
this couple represents what is
best in the English public life...

01:40.362 --> 01:43.832
and is a noble contrast
to the lax morality...

01:43.867 --> 01:47.303
Er, so common amongst
foreign politicians.

01:47.338 --> 01:48.484
Dear oh dear...

01:48.519 --> 01:51.047
they will never say that about me,
will they

01:51.082 --> 01:53.316
I sincerely hope not, sir.

01:54.118 --> 01:55.651
Bit of a busy day today,
I'm afraid.

01:55.686 --> 01:58.854
Distressingly little time
for sloth or idleness.

01:58.889 --> 02:00.675
Sorry to hear it, sir.

02:00.710 --> 02:03.878
Well, not entirely your fault,
Phipps.

02:03.913 --> 02:05.439
Not this time.

02:06.790 --> 02:08.350
Thank you, m'Lord.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.405
Good morning, to Tommy.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.890
Morning, Lady Chilterm.

02:29.925 --> 02:32.543
I very much look forward
to this evening.

02:33.541 --> 02:34.501
Miss Mabel...

02:34.536 --> 02:35.138
Tommy.

02:35.173 --> 02:37.633
I hope you'll be able to
make our usual appointment...

02:37.668 --> 02:40.093
as I have something
particular I wish to say to you.

02:41.124 --> 02:42.302
Good day, ladies.

02:44.356 --> 02:47.869
When Tommy wants to be romantic
he talks to one just like a doctor.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.047
Till tonight.

02:51.076 --> 02:52.784
Miss Mabel.

02:52.819 --> 02:54.493
Lord Goring.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.631
Lord Goring!

02:59.556 --> 03:01.345
Countess-good morning.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.459
Aren't you going to congratulate me,
Lord Goring?

03:03.494 --> 03:05.121
Congratulations.

03:05.156 --> 03:08.161
Aren't you going to ask what for?

03:08.196 --> 03:10.595
I have made a great decision.
I've decided to get married.

03:10.630 --> 03:12.545
My God! Who to?

03:12.580 --> 03:15.263
That part-is still to be decided.

03:16.003 --> 03:18.660
Good morning, dear To Gertrude.

03:18.695 --> 03:20.547
Good morning, Lady Markby.

03:21.188 --> 03:23.491
Allow me to introduce my friend,
Mrs. Cheveley.

03:23.526 --> 03:25.795
Two such charming women
should know each other.

03:25.830 --> 03:26.880
How do you do?

03:26.915 --> 03:29.443
I think Mrs. Cheveley and I
have met before.

03:29.478 --> 03:31.003
of course.

03:31.650 --> 03:32.959
Gertrude.

03:33.699 --> 03:36.384
And to think you married
Sir Robert Chiltern.

03:36.419 --> 03:39.938
Do you know, I was so hoping to
meet your clever husband.

03:39.973 --> 03:41.152
Really?

03:41.187 --> 03:44.419
Yes. But I have to return
to Vienna on Friday.

03:44.454 --> 03:46.458
Oh dear, what a shame.

03:49.474 --> 03:52.738
Well, perhaps I might bring her
this evening?

03:52.773 --> 03:54.259
Yes, by all means.

03:54.294 --> 03:55.596
What can I say?

03:55.631 --> 03:56.863
I'd be delighted.

03:56.898 --> 03:58.529
Well we'll see you tonight.

03:58.564 --> 03:59.871
See you tonight.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.769
You see, Phipps,
fashion is what one wears oneself.

04:28.804 --> 04:31.394
What is unfashionable...

04:31.429 --> 04:33.985
is what other people wear.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.133
Yes, my Lord.

04:35.168 --> 04:36.541
Other people are quite dreadful.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.689
The only possible society is oneself.

04:38.724 --> 04:40.480
Er, yes, my Lord.

04:40.515 --> 04:42.237
To love oneself...

04:43.040 --> 04:46.976
is the beginning of
a lifelong romance.

04:47.011 --> 04:48.405
Yes, my Lord.

04:57.888 --> 05:02.143
Their Graces,
the Duke and Duchess of Berwick.

05:05.951 --> 05:08.155
Lord Windermere.

05:11.359 --> 05:12.766
Countess Basildon.

05:13.535 --> 05:19.388
...and it is widely agreed, the last
truly decent man in London... such...

05:19.423 --> 05:22.943
and that you're a very personable man
possessed of a most attractive personality...

05:22.978 --> 05:26.623
and that you have brought into British
politics an honesty, an integrity...

05:26.658 --> 05:27.612
a finer, a...

05:27.647 --> 05:31.806
a nobler atmosphere a finer attitude
and higher ideals... higher ideals.

05:31.841 --> 05:35.759
Well, one mustn't believe everything
one reads in the newspapers.

05:35.794 --> 05:39.643
Yes, in the old days we had the rack.
Nowadays we have the press.

05:39.678 --> 05:43.134
Your own newspaper being the notable
exception, of course, Sir Edward...

05:43.169 --> 05:45.599
where truth shines out like a beacon...

05:45.634 --> 05:48.030
and lies run vainly for the shadows.

05:48.065 --> 05:50.331
Bravo, Lady Chiltern.

05:50.366 --> 05:53.821
But may I ask, do I detect
in your conversation a lyricism...

05:53.856 --> 05:57.277
not entirely uncommon
in your husband's excellent speeches?

05:57.312 --> 05:59.706
If you are suggesting Sir Edward...

05:59.741 --> 06:02.493
that my position in society owes anything
to my wife, you are utterly mistaken.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.287
It owes everything to my wife.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.011
I demand that you make it known

06:06.046 --> 06:09.755
immediately without her, it's true,
I am entirely unexceptional.

06:10.109 --> 06:12.411
Without her love...

06:13.053 --> 06:14.776
I'm nothing.

06:17.116 --> 06:21.724
Anyway, all I know is, Chiltern, a serious
shake-up in the Government looks inevitable now...

06:21.759 --> 06:25.212
and I have to tell you the Prime Minster
himself was asking about you this morning.

06:25.247 --> 06:26.522
Really?

06:26.557 --> 06:28.444
Probably afraid you'd
be taking his job.

06:28.479 --> 06:30.329
Lady Markby.

06:30.364 --> 06:32.180
Mrs. Cheveley.

06:37.756 --> 06:40.924
Oh, my dear if I had a jewel
for every staring eye...

06:40.959 --> 06:44.347
I'm glad to say, Lady Markby,
you evidently do.

06:44.382 --> 06:44.920
Excuse me.

06:44.955 --> 06:48.251
Ah, chere Madame
quelle surprise!

06:48.286 --> 06:49.401
Lady Markby.

06:49.436 --> 06:50.649
I have not seen you since Berlin.

06:50.684 --> 06:52.856
Not since Berlin, Vicomte,
five years ago.

06:52.891 --> 06:56.731
And you are younger and
more beautiful than ever.

06:56.766 --> 06:57.720
How do you manage it?

06:57.755 --> 07:01.820
By making it a rule only to talk
to charming people like yourself.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.478
Mrs. Cheveley.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.112
What do we know about her?

07:05.147 --> 07:08.859
Very influential in Vienna
In the highest circles.

07:08.894 --> 07:11.480
A force to be reckoned with.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.003
And are you staying in
London long?

07:13.038 --> 07:14.491
That depends partly
on the weather...

07:14.526 --> 07:16.428
partly on the cooking...

07:16.463 --> 07:18.296
and partly on your brother.

07:18.331 --> 07:20.824
My dear... Sir Robert has been
dying to meet you.

07:20.859 --> 07:23.530
Everyone is dying to meet
the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.

07:23.565 --> 07:26.202
Our Attaches in Vienna write to us
about nothing else.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.159
Thank you, Sir Robert.

07:27.194 --> 07:31.610
An acquaintance that begins with a compliment
is sure to develop into a real friendship.

07:31.645 --> 07:32.699
I see you've met my sister.

07:32.734 --> 07:34.291
Yes indeed.

07:35.130 --> 07:40.116
My dear child allow me to introduce
you to the Vicomte De Nanjac.

07:41.978 --> 07:44.666
You have a beautiful house,
Sir Robert.

07:44.701 --> 07:45.975
We're very happy here.

07:46.010 --> 07:48.665
I am sure. I would so love
to look around.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.593
Allow me.

07:49.628 --> 07:50.486
Thank you.

07:50.874 --> 07:53.459
Lord Goring.

07:56.281 --> 07:58.665
Good evening, Lady Rosebury.

07:58.700 --> 08:01.014
Good evening, young lady.

08:01.049 --> 08:03.449
Well, sir,
what are you doing here?

08:03.484 --> 08:04.790
Wasting your life as usual.

08:04.825 --> 08:06.742
You should be in bed, sir.
You keep too late hours.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.753
I heard of you the other night at Lady
Rufford's dancing till four o'clock.

08:09.788 --> 08:11.510
Er, good evening, father.

08:11.545 --> 08:14.121
Can't make out how you stand
London society.

08:14.156 --> 08:16.662
Lot of damn nobodies
talking about nothing.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.544
I love talking about nothing, father.
It's the only thing I know anything about.

08:19.579 --> 08:22.392
That is a paradox, sir.
I hate paradoxes.

08:22.427 --> 08:23.734
So do I, father.

08:23.769 --> 08:26.072
Everyone one meets is
a paradox nowadays.

08:26.107 --> 08:29.141
Makes society so... obvious, hmm?

08:29.176 --> 08:31.800
Do you always understand
what you say, sir?

08:31.835 --> 08:35.957
Yes. If I listen attentively.

08:38.424 --> 08:40.977
Oh, conceited young puppy!

08:41.496 --> 08:45.303
And I have it on very good authority that
you have some delightful Corots as well.

08:45.338 --> 08:47.237
Oh, really whose?

08:47.272 --> 08:49.136
Baron Arnheim.

08:54.711 --> 08:55.960
Did you know the Baron well?

08:55.995 --> 08:57.847
Intimately. Did you?

08:57.882 --> 08:58.900
At one time.

08:58.935 --> 09:00.116
Wonderful man, wasn't he?

09:00.151 --> 09:01.972
He was very remarkable in many ways.

09:02.007 --> 09:06.582
I often think it a pity he never wrote his
memoirs. They would have been interesting.

09:06.617 --> 09:10.230
Allow me to introduce my dearest
friend. The idlest man in London.

09:10.265 --> 09:12.375
Good evening, Lord Goring.

09:12.410 --> 09:14.100
You've met?

09:14.135 --> 09:17.238
I did not think you'd remember me,
Mrs. Er Cheveley.

09:17.273 --> 09:19.783
My memory is
under admirable control.

09:19.818 --> 09:22.294
Sir Robert,
the Indian Ambassador.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.504
Excuse me!

09:27.318 --> 09:29.203
And so, my dear Arthur...

09:29.238 --> 09:31.990
are you not just
a little bit pleased to see me?

09:32.025 --> 09:34.742
Oh, my dear woman...
possibly even less than that.

09:34.777 --> 09:36.658
should you wish to
avoid me entirely...

09:36.693 --> 09:40.085
it is well to know that I'll be
staying at Claridges Hotel until Friday

09:40.120 --> 09:42.256
when I shall return to Vienna.

09:43.221 --> 09:44.789
Are you still a bachelor?

09:44.824 --> 09:46.066
Resolutely so.

09:46.101 --> 09:48.213
Lord Goring is the result of
Boodle's Club, Mrs. Cheveley.

09:48.248 --> 09:50.709
He reflects every credit
on the institution.

09:50.744 --> 09:51.691
Thank you.

10:03.509 --> 10:06.771
And now, Sir Robert,
I have something to say to you.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.757
You'll find me an eager audience.

10:08.792 --> 10:09.938
I'm so glad.

10:09.973 --> 10:13.461
I want to talk to you about a great
political and financial scheme...

10:13.496 --> 10:16.428
about this Argentine Company,
in fact.

10:18.004 --> 10:21.297
What a tedious, practical subject
to talk about, Mrs. Cheveley.

10:21.332 --> 10:25.652
Oh, I like tedious, practical subjects.
What I don't like are practical people.

10:25.687 --> 10:30.324
Besides, you're interested. I know,
in international canal schemes.

10:30.359 --> 10:31.731
Yes.

10:33.139 --> 10:36.148
But the Suez Canal was a very
great and splendid undertaking.

10:36.183 --> 10:39.246
It gave us our direct route
into India.

10:40.371 --> 10:43.971
This Argentine scheme is
a commonplace Stock Exchange swindle.

10:44.006 --> 10:47.572
It is a speculation, Sir Robert,
a brilliant, daring speculation.

10:47.607 --> 10:51.248
Believe me, Mrs. Cheveley,
it is a swindle.

10:51.283 --> 10:54.861
Let us call things by their proper
names. It makes matters simpler.

10:57.811 --> 10:59.983
I hope you've not invested in it.

11:00.018 --> 11:01.938
I'm sure you're far too clever
to have done that.

11:01.973 --> 11:05.616
I have invested very largely in it.

11:05.651 --> 11:07.123
Who could have advised you to do
such a foolish thing?

11:07.158 --> 11:08.594
Your old friend and mine.

11:08.629 --> 11:09.167
Who?

11:09.202 --> 11:09.999
Baron Arnheim.

11:10.034 --> 11:12.969
It was one of the last things
he said.

11:23.058 --> 11:27.953
The future of the canal depends, of course,
on the attitude of Her Majesty's Government.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.638
And...

11:30.673 --> 11:33.998
I will personally be
presenting my report...

11:34.033 --> 11:37.324
to the House of Commons
on Thursday night.

11:38.257 --> 11:41.105
I can tell you now that I will
be condemning the scheme in

11:41.140 --> 11:42.482
no uncertain terms.

11:42.517 --> 11:43.790
That you must not do.

11:43.825 --> 11:45.969
In your own interests,
to say nothing of mine...

11:46.004 --> 11:48.334
you must not do that.

11:48.369 --> 11:50.545
Mr. dear Mrs. Cheveley
what do you mean?

11:50.580 --> 11:52.686
Sir Robert,
I will be quite frank with you.

11:52.721 --> 11:57.073
I want you to amend that report to state
that the canal will be of international value.

11:57.108 --> 11:59.047
Will you do that for me?

12:02.193 --> 12:03.776
You cannot be serious.

12:03.811 --> 12:05.325
I am quite serious...

12:05.360 --> 12:09.680
and if you do what I ask
I will pay you very handsomely.

12:09.715 --> 12:10.446
Pay me?

12:10.481 --> 12:14.032
My dear Sir Robert, you are a man of the
world and you have you price, I suppose.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.725
Everybody has nowadays.

12:15.760 --> 12:19.504
If you will allow me,
I will call your carriage for you.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.293
You have lived so long abroad,
Mrs. Cheveley...

12:21.328 --> 12:24.431
that you seem to be unable to realise that
you're talking to an English gentleman.

12:24.466 --> 12:26.189
I realize that
I'm talking to a man...

12:26.224 --> 12:30.664
whose past is perhaps less perfect
than his reputation would suggest.

12:33.455 --> 12:35.564
What are you saying?

12:35.599 --> 12:39.119
I am saying that I know the real
origin of your wealth and your career...

12:39.154 --> 12:42.054
...and I have got your letter too.

12:44.399 --> 12:45.855
You are very late.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.311
Did you miss me?

12:47.346 --> 12:48.012
Awfully.

12:48.047 --> 12:50.927
Then I am sorry I did not stay away
later. I like being missed.

12:50.962 --> 12:51.982
How very selfish of you.

12:52.017 --> 12:53.195
I am very selfish.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.726
Lord Goring, you are always telling
me about your bad qualities.

12:55.761 --> 12:57.678
And I haven't told you the half of
them as yet. Miss Mabel.

12:57.713 --> 12:59.596
Really? Are the others very bad?

12:59.631 --> 13:04.202
Quite dreadful. When I think of them
at night I can go to sleep at once.

13:04.591 --> 13:06.507
Well...

13:06.542 --> 13:10.958
I must tell you that I like your qualities
and I wouldn't have you part with one.

13:10.993 --> 13:13.643
This shows
your admirable good taste.

13:13.678 --> 13:16.269
Miss Mabel. May I have the pleasure
of escorting you to the music room?

13:16.304 --> 13:18.605
Why, Tommy, I'd be delighted.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.755
As indeed would I.

13:19.790 --> 13:21.067
Are you coming to the music room?

13:21.102 --> 13:23.949
Um, not if there is any music
going on, Miss Mabel.

13:23.984 --> 13:26.207
Well the music is in German...

13:26.242 --> 13:28.430
so you would not understand it.

13:28.465 --> 13:30.502
Quite so, quite so.

13:31.470 --> 13:32.842
Arthur!

13:32.877 --> 13:34.250
Gertrude, good evening.

13:34.285 --> 13:36.042
Didn't think you liked
political parties.

13:36.077 --> 13:40.965
I adore political parties. They're the
place left where people don't talk politics.

13:44.141 --> 13:47.340
The affair to which you allude
was no more than a speculation.

13:47.375 --> 13:48.714
It was a swindle, Sir Robert.

13:48.749 --> 13:52.426
"Let's call things by their proper
names. It makes matters simpler."

13:53.037 --> 13:55.626
And now I'm going to
sell you that letter back...

13:55.661 --> 14:00.679
and the price I ask for it is your
public support of the Argentine scheme.

14:02.188 --> 14:04.201
I cannot do what you ask me.

14:04.236 --> 14:07.499
You are standing on the edge of
a precipice, Sir Robert.

14:07.534 --> 14:10.379
Supposing you refuse?

14:10.414 --> 14:10.952
What then?

14:10.987 --> 14:13.707
Suppose I were to pay a visit
to a newspaper office

14:13.742 --> 14:16.428
and give them this scandal...
and the proof of it.

14:16.463 --> 14:17.928
Think of their loathsome joy.

14:17.963 --> 14:20.524
Think of the delight they would
have in tearing you down.

14:20.559 --> 14:21.961
Think...

14:21.996 --> 14:23.364
Sir Edward.

14:23.819 --> 14:26.184
My dear Mrs. Cheveley.

14:26.219 --> 14:29.099
I do hope we have the opportunity
to meet up while you're in London.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.787
I so enjoy the cut and thrust
of continental politics.

14:31.822 --> 14:34.308
I shall make it a
particular priority.

14:34.891 --> 14:36.865
Sir Robert.

14:42.603 --> 14:45.962
It is infamous what you propose.

14:45.997 --> 14:46.727
Infamous.

14:46.762 --> 14:49.500
Oh no... it is the game of life,
Sir Robert...

14:49.700 --> 14:53.200
...as we all have to play it...
sooner of later.

15:15.625 --> 15:19.305
What a charming house, Lady Chiltern.
I have spent a delightful evening.

15:19.340 --> 15:20.998
I'm so glad.

15:21.033 --> 15:25.097
And so glad, too, you had a chance
to meet my husband, Mrs. Cheveley.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.886
Though...

15:26.921 --> 15:31.433
I must confess to some curiosity as
to the matter of your conversation.

15:31.468 --> 15:33.257
Your carriage is waiting,
Mrs. Cheveley.

15:33.292 --> 15:34.310
Thanks.

15:34.345 --> 15:37.961
Well, another time perhaps,
Lady Chiltern, Good evening.

15:37.996 --> 15:40.066
Good evening, Mrs. Cheveley.

15:41.353 --> 15:42.917
Will you see me out, Sir Robert?

15:42.952 --> 15:45.224
Now that we have
the same interests at heart,

15:45.259 --> 15:48.540
we will be great friends, I hope.

15:49.128 --> 15:50.557
Certainly.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.820
You must let me have more time
to consider your proposal.

15:58.855 --> 16:02.824
There is nothing to consider. Support
the scheme and I will return the letter.

16:02.859 --> 16:05.829
Scandals used to lend charm,
or at least interest, to a man...

16:05.864 --> 16:10.247
nowadays they crush him. And yours
is a very nasty scandal, Sir Robert.

16:10.282 --> 16:12.551
You would be hounded
out of public life.

16:12.586 --> 16:15.039
You would disappear completely.

16:15.527 --> 16:17.120
My God!

16:18.471 --> 16:19.975
What brought you into my life?

16:20.010 --> 16:21.348
Circumstances.

16:21.383 --> 16:27.013
At some point we all have to pay for
what we do. You have to pay now.

16:28.647 --> 16:31.844
I will give you any sum of money
you want.

16:31.879 --> 16:35.463
Even you're not rich enough
to buy back your past.

16:35.498 --> 16:37.601
No man is.

16:57.317 --> 17:00.262
...yes, but the fact is, father this
is not my day for talking seriously.

17:00.297 --> 17:01.605
I am very sorry
but it is not my day.

17:01.640 --> 17:02.563
What do you mean, sir?

17:02.598 --> 17:04.450
I mean that during the season,
father...

17:04.484 --> 17:08.101
I only talk seriously on the
first Tuesday in every month.

17:08.136 --> 17:08.962
Between noon and three.

17:08.997 --> 17:11.237
Well make it Tuesday, sir.
Make it Tuesday.

17:11.271 --> 17:13.443
Ah, yes, but it's before noon,
father...

17:13.478 --> 17:15.653
and that's what I'm trying to say. I'm
very sorry but my doctor said specifically.

17:15.688 --> 17:17.507
You are thirty-six...

17:17.701 --> 17:19.810
Father!

17:19.845 --> 17:21.252
I only admit to thirty-two.

17:21.288 --> 17:22.662
You are thirty-six...

17:22.696 --> 17:24.037
and you must get a wife.

17:24.071 --> 17:26.109
Wife?

17:29.413 --> 17:32.828
A shade lack luster this morning,
Chiltern.

17:35.237 --> 17:38.532
Mind on other matters
I shouldn't wonder.

17:40.292 --> 17:44.154
I had that Cheveley woman drive
by the office last night.

17:44.516 --> 17:46.260
Really?

17:46.295 --> 17:47.969
Yes.

17:48.004 --> 17:52.324
Wanted me to write a piece
about this Argentine thing.

17:52.359 --> 17:55.011
Quite interesting really.

17:55.046 --> 17:56.100
Mentioned you.

17:56.135 --> 17:57.537
Did she?

17:57.572 --> 17:59.677
She did indeed.

18:02.884 --> 18:04.417
So what did she say?

18:04.452 --> 18:08.099
Outlined the virtues of the scheme,
that sort of thing.

18:08.134 --> 18:11.171
Wouldn't be surprised
if she had shares in it.

18:11.206 --> 18:13.088
What did she say about me?

18:13.123 --> 18:16.451
About your speech on it. Said I
should be prepared for a surprise.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.207
Wouldn't say what.

18:19.075 --> 18:22.391
Can I take it
you've changed your position?

18:32.706 --> 18:35.075
I wonder what kind of
a woman she is.

18:35.110 --> 18:36.479
Who?

18:36.514 --> 18:39.394
That woman, Mrs. Cheveley.

18:39.429 --> 18:42.111
Hmm, smallish.

18:42.914 --> 18:46.178
So the question remains,
where to from there, hmm?

18:46.213 --> 18:50.618
To the Hartlocks then the Basildons.

18:50.945 --> 18:53.601
...or should we go straight
to the Bachelor's Ball?

18:53.636 --> 18:55.938
You know, Arthur, I almost wish
I were you sometimes.

18:55.973 --> 18:58.206
Hmm, do you know, Robert,
I almost wish you were too.

18:58.241 --> 19:02.721
Except that you'd probably make something
useful out of my life and that would never do.

19:02.756 --> 19:04.414
You could always get married.

19:04.449 --> 19:07.199
It's the "always"
bit that alarms me.

19:09.025 --> 19:13.376
...and I could see by the glare in his
eye that he was about to do it again!

19:13.411 --> 19:14.750
Poor Mr. Trafford.

19:14.785 --> 19:16.353
It sounds quite serious.

19:16.388 --> 19:17.374
Oh, it is.

19:17.409 --> 19:19.230
He proposed to me in broad daylight

19:19.265 --> 19:21.214
in front of that dreadful
statue of Achilles.

19:21.249 --> 19:25.504
oh really, the things that go on in front
of that work of art are quite appalling.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.260
The police should interfere.

19:29.824 --> 19:33.664
I know it may not suit
a modern girl like you, Mabel,

19:33.699 --> 19:37.088
but there is, of course,
one... effective way

19:37.123 --> 19:38.752
to put a stop to his proposals.

19:38.787 --> 19:39.969
And what would that be?

19:40.004 --> 19:41.152
To accept one of them.

19:41.187 --> 19:43.291
Oh no!

19:44.032 --> 19:45.309
Ladies!

19:46.367 --> 19:50.144
By the way have you been
talking to my father?

19:50.179 --> 19:51.677
Why? Should I?

19:51.712 --> 19:53.176
Certainly not.

19:53.599 --> 19:57.500
He was foolish enough to
suggest that I model myself on you.

19:57.535 --> 20:00.799
I've always said that your father was a
man of exquisite taste and rare judgement.

20:00.834 --> 20:04.156
Hard work, probity and a good woman.

20:04.191 --> 20:08.095
He neglected to mention that you
took the last good woman I know.

20:08.130 --> 20:11.356
Took her right out of my arms,
if I remember correctly.

20:11.391 --> 20:14.206
Which you don't. What's that saying
about the sea and there being fish in it?

20:14.241 --> 20:17.150
Hmm, ah, yes, but I couldn't
possibly marry a fish.

20:17.185 --> 20:21.079
I'd be sure to land an old trout.

20:21.790 --> 20:24.666
I never change
except in my affection.

20:24.701 --> 20:27.543
What a noble nature you have,
Gwendolen!

20:28.382 --> 20:30.654
Well then the question had better
be cleared up at once.

20:30.689 --> 20:31.643
But you told me yesterday.

20:31.678 --> 20:35.038
I have reason to believe that
the information I received was...

20:35.073 --> 20:36.467
prejudiced.

20:37.918 --> 20:39.262
Or any rate, misinformed.

20:39.297 --> 20:39.738
But I...

20:39.773 --> 20:42.622
I now believe that there may be
some benefit to the scheme after all.

20:42.657 --> 20:44.173
Benefit?

20:44.208 --> 20:45.689
To whom?

20:47.326 --> 20:50.937
This has nothing to do with
Mrs. Cheveley, does it?

20:53.246 --> 20:57.075
You seem to be displaying
signs of triviality.

20:57.405 --> 20:59.098
On the contrary, Aunt Augusta...

20:59.133 --> 21:01.693
I've now realized for
the first time in my life...

21:01.728 --> 21:05.108
the vital importance
of being earnest.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.591
Robert...

21:10.013 --> 21:14.769
You are telling me
the whole truth?

21:15.356 --> 21:18.324
Why do ask me such a question?

21:21.020 --> 21:23.354
Why do you not answer it?

21:26.076 --> 21:32.983
Author!

21:33.660 --> 21:34.937
Ladies and gentlemen...

21:34.972 --> 21:39.435
I have enjoyed this evening
immensely.

21:39.470 --> 21:43.899
Robert, is there,
in your life, any...

21:43.934 --> 21:49.692
any secret, any...

21:49.727 --> 21:52.561
indiscretion?

21:53.180 --> 21:54.904
...which persuades me...

21:54.939 --> 21:57.307
that you think as highly
of the play as I so myself.

21:57.342 --> 21:59.640
You must tell me, you must,
you must tell me at once.

21:59.675 --> 22:04.726
Oh, Gertrude, there is nothing in my
past life that you might not know.

22:07.611 --> 22:11.451
I was sure of it, my darling.

22:11.486 --> 22:13.239
I was sure of it.

22:40.121 --> 22:44.569
You know, I found it a perfectly
charming evening. Of course I did.

22:44.604 --> 22:47.446
And yours was a perfectly
charming performance.

22:47.481 --> 22:53.013
The costumes were, of course, delightful,
but for me... it was the acting.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.383
Would you excuse me a moment?

23:00.825 --> 23:01.686
Miss Mabel?

23:01.721 --> 23:03.094
Good evening, Lord Goring.

23:03.129 --> 23:04.472
Shouldn't you be in bed,
Miss Mabel?

23:04.507 --> 23:05.782
Lord Goring!

23:05.817 --> 23:07.285
My father always tells me
to go to bed,

23:07.320 --> 23:08.949
so I don't see why I shouldn't
give you the same advice.

23:08.984 --> 23:12.728
I always pass on good advice. It's
the only sensible thing to do with it.

23:12.763 --> 23:14.265
Well, it's very kind of you
to offer Lord Goring.

23:14.300 --> 23:15.818
Don't mention it, Miss Mabel.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.301
But I feel I should report...

23:17.336 --> 23:21.656
that the role of elder brother is for the
moment, being more than adequately performed...

23:21.691 --> 23:22.808
...by my elder brother.

23:22.843 --> 23:23.349
Oh, really?

23:23.384 --> 23:29.333
Yes, Charming and delightful
performance it is too.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.896
I really think you ought to go to
bed straight away, Miss Mabel.

23:31.931 --> 23:35.016
Lord Goring
you're ordering me around.

23:35.051 --> 23:38.102
I think
it's most courageous of you.

23:38.999 --> 23:41.999
'Specially as
I'm not going to bed for hours.

24:00.247 --> 24:02.967
Darling, you will write
won't you

24:03.002 --> 24:04.819
to Mrs. Cheveley?

24:04.854 --> 24:08.694
And tell her that you cannot
support this scheme of hers.

24:08.729 --> 24:10.899
I might see her.

24:10.934 --> 24:13.555
Perhaps that would be better.

24:13.590 --> 24:16.467
Oh no, Robert, you must never
see her again.

24:16.502 --> 24:19.382
Darling, I know this woman.
We were at school together.

24:19.417 --> 24:23.154
I didn't trust her then and
I don't trust her now.

24:23.189 --> 24:27.979
And she must know at once that
she has been mistaken in you.

24:28.501 --> 24:34.198
Now all your life you have stood
apart from others.

24:34.233 --> 24:38.231
To the world, as to myself...

24:38.266 --> 24:42.229
you have been an ideal.
Always.

24:42.264 --> 24:44.618
Be that ideal still.

24:59.668 --> 25:01.525
Claridges Hotel.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.356
No answer.

25:02.391 --> 25:05.203
Sir.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.889
I love you, Robert.

25:15.764 --> 25:19.244
Oh, love me.

25:25.876 --> 25:28.625
Love me, Gertrude.

25:29.620 --> 25:31.529
Love me always.

25:53.682 --> 25:55.248
Madam.

25:55.283 --> 25:58.419
So, what is it that brings you back
to London after all these years?

25:58.454 --> 25:59.919
Business or pleasure?

25:59.954 --> 26:03.026
As it happens I have some business
with your friend, Sir Robert Chiltern...

26:03.061 --> 26:06.255
which, is of course,
a great pleasure.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.449
And what is it that
brings you here tonight?

26:14.484 --> 26:16.003
I came because you asked me to.

26:16.038 --> 26:17.522
And because you were curious?

26:17.557 --> 26:18.479
I suppose.

26:18.514 --> 26:19.503
Why did you ask me?

26:19.538 --> 26:22.225
Because I was curious also
to see whether you'd come.

26:22.260 --> 26:24.207
And you did.

26:24.242 --> 26:26.990
I see you are quite as wilful
as you used to be.

26:27.025 --> 26:31.598
Far more. I've greatly improved.
I've had more experience.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.161
Too much experience can be a very
dangerous thing, Mrs. Cheveley.

26:34.196 --> 26:35.889
Why don't you call me Laura?

26:35.924 --> 26:36.738
I don't like the name.

26:36.773 --> 26:38.347
You used to adore it.

26:38.382 --> 26:39.886
Yes, that is why.

26:39.921 --> 26:43.169
To think,it was so nearly
Laura Goring.

26:43.204 --> 26:46.170
It has a certain ring,
don't you agree?

26:46.205 --> 26:49.102
We were quite well suited
I remember.

26:49.137 --> 26:52.368
Well, you were poor, I was rich.
It must have suited you very well.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.829
Until you met the Baron,
of course...

26:54.864 --> 26:57.712
who was richer and that
suited you much better.

26:57.747 --> 26:58.640
Have you forgiven me yet?

26:58.675 --> 26:59.437
My dear woman...

26:59.472 --> 27:02.472
it's been so long now that
I'd all but forgotten you.

27:03.152 --> 27:04.848
Isn't that Goring?

27:04.883 --> 27:05.485
It is.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.592
I'm afraid I really must go I have
an extremely pressing engagement.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.956
Really? Well as you know...

27:10.991 --> 27:14.374
I hate to stand between
a man and his affairs.

27:25.743 --> 27:27.695
Come on, Bunbury,
for good ness sake.

27:27.730 --> 27:28.844
I can't believe it.

27:28.879 --> 27:31.052
You are a deserter, sir.

27:31.087 --> 27:31.980
I didn't say
I was getting married...

27:32.015 --> 27:34.351
I was merely debating
the virtues of the marital state.

27:34.386 --> 27:35.887
Lord Goring, there's a gentleman
to see you, sir.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.388
Short debate, sir.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.147
We're a dying breed, old man.

27:39.182 --> 27:41.614
At all costs
we must stick together.

27:41.649 --> 27:43.370
If you'd excuse me, gentlemen?

27:43.405 --> 27:45.092
Play the next hand without me.

27:53.710 --> 27:58.910
And now I think it's time
you knew the truth...

27:58.945 --> 28:04.110
that all these riches
this wondrous luxury...

28:04.145 --> 28:06.795
amounts finally to nothing.

28:06.830 --> 28:11.006
And that power
power over other men...

28:11.041 --> 28:15.147
is the one and
only thing worth having.

28:15.182 --> 28:21.194
Now this one I call
the 'Philosophy of Power'.

28:22.541 --> 28:25.130
'Gospel of Gold'.

28:25.165 --> 28:27.836
So now the question arises...

28:27.871 --> 28:30.646
how do you become
powerful.

28:30.681 --> 28:33.421
I mean you
personally powerful.

28:33.456 --> 28:35.363
Cigar?

28:36.268 --> 28:37.730
Yes, thank you.

28:40.620 --> 28:42.660
The answer is simple.

28:43.116 --> 28:45.612
The answer...

28:45.647 --> 28:48.073
is information.

28:48.108 --> 28:50.892
Information is
the modern commodity...

28:50.927 --> 28:53.053
that can shake the world.

28:53.088 --> 28:55.145
And I happen to know...

28:55.180 --> 28:58.376
it's well within your grasp.

29:01.292 --> 29:03.680
And you believed what he said?

29:04.204 --> 29:06.026
Certainly.

29:06.283 --> 29:09.098
I believed it
then and I believe it now.

29:10.924 --> 29:12.779
You've never been poor.

29:14.027 --> 29:16.842
You've never known
what ambition is.

29:18.027 --> 29:19.587
Go on.

29:20.107 --> 29:22.952
Well, by now Lord Radley was
a Cabinet Minister and...

29:22.987 --> 29:27.243
as the Baron well knew, I was
working as his personal secretary.

29:27.278 --> 29:32.099
And one night, as usual
I was the last to leave the office.

29:39.723 --> 29:41.895
Later that evening...

29:41.930 --> 29:45.223
I wrote the Baron a letter containing
highly confidential information.

29:45.258 --> 29:51.488
And highly valuable information
regarding the financing of the Suez Canal.

29:52.010 --> 29:53.962
A Cabinet Secret?

29:53.997 --> 29:56.199
Indeed.

29:56.426 --> 30:01.865
In a subsequent transaction the Baron made
for himself three quarters of a million pounds.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.036
And you?

30:04.266 --> 30:09.055
I received from the Baron one
hundred and ten thousand pounds.

30:11.657 --> 30:13.577
You were worth more, Robert.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.718
No. No. No.

30:15.753 --> 30:20.937
I got exactly what I wanted I entered
straight into Parliament and I've...

30:20.972 --> 30:23.326
well I've never looked back.

30:23.784 --> 30:26.472
Is it fair, Arthur, that some act
of youthful folly...

30:26.507 --> 30:29.161
should be brought up against me
now all these years later?

30:29.196 --> 30:30.085
Is it fair?

30:30.120 --> 30:32.357
Robert, life is never fair

30:32.392 --> 30:34.952
And Perhaps it is a good thing for
most of us that it's not.

30:34.987 --> 30:38.301
Now, what does Gertrude
make of all this?

30:41.256 --> 30:42.467
Robert?

30:45.768 --> 30:46.885
My dear Robert...

30:46.920 --> 30:50.824
secrets from other people's wives are
necessary luxury in modern life.

30:50.859 --> 30:54.759
But no man should have
a secret from his own wife.

30:54.794 --> 30:56.329
She invariably finds it out.

30:56.364 --> 30:57.829
If I were to tell her, Arthur,

30:57.864 --> 31:01.246
I would lose the love of the one
woman in the world I worship.

31:01.608 --> 31:03.492
I couldn't tell her, but it

31:03.527 --> 31:05.862
did strike me
that perhaps you might.

31:08.327 --> 31:09.734
Go on.

31:10.183 --> 31:13.735
Well, perhaps you might
talk with her.

31:13.770 --> 31:14.244
Oh really.

31:14.279 --> 31:16.996
Not to tell her, of course...

31:17.031 --> 31:19.713
but just to
talk with her.

31:20.519 --> 31:21.828
I see.

31:22.342 --> 31:27.075
It's just that Gertrude can sometimes
be a little hard-headed.

31:27.110 --> 31:31.302
And you are her oldest and perhaps
closest friend and I, and I just thought...

31:31.337 --> 31:33.734
talking with you might perhaps...

31:33.769 --> 31:35.490
soften her head a little?

31:35.525 --> 31:37.212
Well,it has been known.

31:42.470 --> 31:44.454
Thank you, Lady Chiltern,
that was most inspiring.

31:44.489 --> 31:45.828
Oh, I'm so glad.

31:55.462 --> 31:56.994
Well I must say, Arthur...

31:57.029 --> 32:01.829
I'm delighted to find you showing such
a keen interest in women's politics.

32:01.864 --> 32:03.390
Oh yes, very keen.

32:03.845 --> 32:06.277
I'm afraid I had a little bit
of a late night last night.

32:06.312 --> 32:08.194
So I gather.

32:08.229 --> 32:09.221
I'm so glad to see you.

32:09.256 --> 32:09.697
Are you?

32:09.732 --> 32:12.581
Yes. I wanted to talk to
you about Robert.

32:12.616 --> 32:14.010
Really?

32:14.245 --> 32:15.938
He seems a little...

32:15.973 --> 32:18.372
distracted of late.
A little anxious.

32:18.407 --> 32:20.194
Yes.

32:20.229 --> 32:22.116
You've noticed it too?

32:23.076 --> 32:25.541
I suppose, er yes.

32:25.576 --> 32:26.689
In a way.

32:26.724 --> 32:30.820
I mean the life that he's chosen
for himself by its own nature...

32:30.855 --> 32:32.997
must hold innumerable stresses...

32:33.032 --> 32:35.140
full of countless compromises.

32:35.175 --> 32:36.229
Compromises?

32:36.264 --> 32:37.249
Well, yes.

32:37.284 --> 32:38.496
What I mean is...

32:38.531 --> 32:44.036
...once a man has set his heart and
soul on getting to a certain point...

32:44.071 --> 32:48.868
if he has to climb the crag,
he has to climb the crag.

32:48.903 --> 32:51.108
And if he has to walk
in the mire...

32:51.143 --> 32:53.312
Well?

32:53.347 --> 32:56.339
Well then he has to walk,
my dear Gertrude, in the mire.

32:56.374 --> 32:59.331
Of course I'm only talking
in the most general terms and

32:59.366 --> 33:01.856
on a subject about which
I know absolutely nothing.

33:01.891 --> 33:05.251
I always thought those were
your favourite subjects, Arthur.

33:05.286 --> 33:09.283
Yes, indeed Indeed.

33:09.318 --> 33:10.752
Go on.

33:10.787 --> 33:12.159
Oh yes, no, umm...

33:12.194 --> 33:15.586
No but supposing, for instance,
a public figure, any public figure

33:15.621 --> 33:19.107
...Er, Lord Merton or my father
or Robert even say...

33:19.142 --> 33:22.594
had, years ago, written some
foolish letter to someone...

33:22.629 --> 33:24.479
what do you mean by
a foolish letter'?

33:24.514 --> 33:29.506
well, I mean a letter gravely
compromising one's position.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.607
I'm putting an imaginary case,
of course.

33:32.642 --> 33:38.588
I cannot help but feel, Arthur, that
you are wanting to tell me something.

33:42.305 --> 33:46.593
What I really want to say,
dear Gertrude, is...

33:46.628 --> 33:50.847
that if for any reason
you are ever in trouble...

33:50.882 --> 33:55.105
come to me at once and know that
I will help you in every way I can.

33:55.140 --> 33:56.959
Lord Goring...

33:56.994 --> 34:00.478
you are talking quite seriously.

34:00.513 --> 34:03.264
Well, you must forgive me,
Lady Chiltern. It won't occur again.

34:03.299 --> 34:04.353
No, I like you to be serious.

34:04.388 --> 34:05.757
Gertrude?

34:05.792 --> 34:08.705
Please don't say such
dreadful things to Lord Goring.

34:08.739 --> 34:11.261
Seriousness would be
very unbecoming to him.

34:11.295 --> 34:13.757
Good morning, Lord Goring.
Pray be as trivial as you can.

34:13.792 --> 34:17.312
Oh I should like to, but I'm afraid I'm
a little out of practice this morning.

34:17.347 --> 34:19.808
Besides,
I really ought to be going.

34:19.842 --> 34:21.809
Oh, will you be there tonight?

34:21.844 --> 34:23.775
Well, I've received no invitation.

34:23.811 --> 34:26.813
Well, you have now.

34:26.848 --> 34:29.277
I'm sorry, Mabel, I'm not
in the mood for modern art.

34:29.312 --> 34:34.047
You don't mind, do you,
if Arthur escorts you in my place?

34:34.083 --> 34:35.809
As long as he promises
not to be serious.

34:35.844 --> 34:37.501
For I have observed
a worrying trend.

34:37.536 --> 34:41.792
I swear on my life to be utterly
trivial and never to keep my word.

34:41.827 --> 34:43.072
In which case
I shall be delighted.

34:43.107 --> 34:45.020
In which case so shall I.

34:45.054 --> 34:46.934
My dear, Gertrude
thank you.

34:49.407 --> 34:52.063
You will remember
what I said to you, won't you?

34:52.098 --> 34:54.719
Yes. But I still
don't know why you said it.

34:54.754 --> 34:56.333
I hardly know myself.

34:56.369 --> 34:57.915
Goodbye. Miss Mabel.

34:59.071 --> 35:00.315
Lord Goring?

35:01.919 --> 35:03.163
Lord Goring?

35:04.383 --> 35:07.646
What dreadful manners you have,
leaving just as I arrive.

35:07.681 --> 35:09.599
I'm sure you were
very badly brought up.

35:09.634 --> 35:10.491
Hmm, I was.

35:10.526 --> 35:11.678
I wish I had brought you up.

35:11.713 --> 35:13.692
I'm sorry you didn't.

35:13.727 --> 35:15.788
It is too late now, I suppose?

35:15.823 --> 35:17.850
I shouldn't think so for a moment.

35:25.022 --> 35:26.680
So...

35:31.422 --> 35:32.410
So...

35:32.445 --> 35:34.537
Till tonight then.

35:34.572 --> 35:36.630
Eight o'clock.

35:37.278 --> 35:38.772
Eight o'clock.

35:46.461 --> 35:50.292
So...

35:52.893 --> 35:54.585
My dear Sir Robert...

35:54.620 --> 35:58.909
I must confess to being not disappointed
to receive your letter of last night...

35:58.944 --> 36:01.754
and to learn that my proposition
held no interest for you.

36:01.789 --> 36:06.716
perhaps I failed to present it in
sufficiently attractive or persuasive terms.

36:06.751 --> 36:09.948
Another time perhaps
Yours sincerely...

36:09.983 --> 36:11.802
Laura Cheveley.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.713
Ps. If I should be
in the neighbourhood...

36:14.748 --> 36:17.785
I might just pay my respects
to your charming wife.

36:17.820 --> 36:21.616
I wonder whether the matter
would be of any interest to her?

36:24.668 --> 36:25.912
Mrs. Cheveley?

36:27.100 --> 36:28.571
Won't you sit down?

36:28.606 --> 36:30.520
Thanks.

36:30.555 --> 36:31.384
And you know...

36:31.419 --> 36:34.907
I can't help feeling that
this disturbing new thing, this...

36:34.942 --> 36:36.888
'Higher Education of Women'

36:36.923 --> 36:39.480
will deal a terrible blow to
happy married life.

36:39.515 --> 36:41.915
The higher education of men is
what I should like to see.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.352
Men need it so sadly.

36:43.387 --> 36:46.747
They do, dear. But I'm afraid such
a scheme would be quite unpractical.

36:46.782 --> 36:49.435
I don't think man has much
capacity for development

36:49.470 --> 36:51.340
He's got as far as he can.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.176
And that's not far, is it?

36:53.211 --> 36:55.531
With regard to women, well,
dear Gertrude...

36:55.566 --> 36:57.816
modern women understand everything,
I'm told.

36:57.851 --> 37:01.882
Except their husbands. That is the one
thing the modern woman never understands.

37:01.917 --> 37:04.939
And a very good thing too, dear,
I dare say...

37:04.974 --> 37:07.962
it might break up many
a happy home if they did.

37:07.997 --> 37:11.066
Not yours, I need hardly say,
Gertrude.

37:11.101 --> 37:14.135
You have married
the perfect husband.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.770
And now, dear ladies,
I had better set forth.

37:17.805 --> 37:20.439
I haven't time to be
idling around here all day.

37:20.474 --> 37:24.153
I should be idling around somewhere
else very shortly or I shall fall behind.

37:24.188 --> 37:27.094
No, no, I'll see myself out.

37:27.129 --> 37:31.674
No doubt you both have pleasant reminiscences
of your school days to talk together.

37:31.709 --> 37:32.374
Goodbye.

37:32.409 --> 37:33.554
Goodbye, my dear

37:39.033 --> 37:41.206
Wonderful woman, Lady Markby,
isn't she?

37:41.241 --> 37:44.185
Talks more and says less than
anybody I ever met.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.120
Now, Gertrude.

37:46.155 --> 37:48.021
Mrs. Cheveley.

37:48.760 --> 37:53.177
I think it is right to tell you that I wish
you never to return to this house again.

37:53.212 --> 37:56.598
And never to attempt to
contact my husband.

37:56.633 --> 37:59.288
I see that after all these years
you've not changed a bit.

37:59.323 --> 38:00.534
I hope I never will.

38:00.569 --> 38:02.137
Then life's taught you nothing?

38:02.172 --> 38:03.349
It has taught me that

38:03.384 --> 38:07.288
a person who has once been guilty of
a dishonest and dishonorable action

38:07.323 --> 38:10.328
may be guilty of it
a second time and should be shunned.

38:10.363 --> 38:12.728
Would you apply that rule
to everyone?

38:12.763 --> 38:15.092
Yes. Without exception.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.047
Then I am sorry for you
Gertrude.

38:17.082 --> 38:19.540
Very sorry for you.

38:19.575 --> 38:22.197
I thank you for your sympathy...

38:22.232 --> 38:26.006
but it is your departure
I would prefer.

38:27.223 --> 38:30.484
Do you know, Gertrude, I don't mind
you talking morality a bit.

38:30.519 --> 38:34.007
Morality is simply the attitude we adopt
towards people whom we personally dislike.

38:34.042 --> 38:36.183
You dislike me.
I am quite aware of that.

38:36.218 --> 38:38.228
And I have always detested you.

38:38.263 --> 38:41.591
And yet I have come here
to give you some advice.

38:41.626 --> 38:44.884
I hold your husband
in the hollow of my hand...

38:44.919 --> 38:48.407
and if you are wise you'll make him
do what I tell him.

38:48.442 --> 38:52.951
How dare you class my husband
with yourself?!

38:52.986 --> 38:54.931
Leave my house!

38:54.966 --> 38:56.755
You are unfit to enter it!

38:56.790 --> 39:00.182
Your house? A house bought
with the price of dishonour?

39:00.217 --> 39:04.086
Everything in which has been
paid for by fraud.

39:04.121 --> 39:06.867
Ask him what the origin of
his fortune is.

39:06.902 --> 39:11.190
Get him to tell you how he sold
to a stockbroker a Cabinet secret.

39:11.225 --> 39:15.574
Learn from him to what
you owe your position.

39:15.609 --> 39:17.525
It is not true.

39:17.560 --> 39:18.931
Robert...

39:18.966 --> 39:20.875
tell her it is not true.

39:26.581 --> 39:28.108
Go.

39:30.261 --> 39:34.384
Go at once.
You've done your worst now.

39:42.869 --> 39:43.989
Dear Sir Robert...

39:44.024 --> 39:45.074
Lady Chiltern...

39:45.109 --> 39:49.940
unless you meet my terms I think
you'll fine the worst is yet to come.

39:49.975 --> 39:52.875
You have until
half past ten tonight.

39:58.132 --> 40:00.401
Tell me it is not true.

40:03.348 --> 40:04.369
Let me explain...

40:04.404 --> 40:06.897
Tell me it is not true!

40:06.932 --> 40:08.724
Please. let me tell you,
please! Listen to me!

40:08.759 --> 40:10.292
No, don't come near me!
Don't touch me!

40:10.327 --> 40:11.253
Listen to me!

40:11.288 --> 40:12.145
How could you?!

40:12.180 --> 40:15.427
How could you do that, Robert?!

40:15.462 --> 40:18.028
You've lied to the whole world!

40:18.063 --> 40:20.560
You, you will not lie to me.

40:20.595 --> 40:22.557
Gertrude, please, I must tell you!

40:22.592 --> 40:24.520
No, don't say...
don't say anything!

40:30.099 --> 40:32.623
You were to me...

40:32.658 --> 40:35.987
something apart from common life.

40:36.022 --> 40:40.624
A thing noble pure.

40:42.322 --> 40:46.387
The world seemed to me
finer because you were in it.

40:46.422 --> 40:50.249
And goodness more real
because you lived...

40:55.922 --> 40:58.224
I'm... I'm sorry.

41:00.849 --> 41:02.704
So very sorry.

41:08.785 --> 41:12.680
I, I suppose I should go.

41:13.649 --> 41:14.413
Should I?

41:24.561 --> 41:26.470
Go.

41:29.201 --> 41:30.248
Get out!

42:13.423 --> 42:16.815
Ah, my second button-hole.
Much better.

42:16.850 --> 42:17.324
And, do you know, Phipps...

42:17.359 --> 42:21.103
a really well made
button-hole is the only link...

42:21.138 --> 42:22.959
between art and nature.

42:22.994 --> 42:25.064
Yes, my Lord.

42:29.007 --> 42:32.073
I don't think
I quite like this one.

42:33.582 --> 42:35.980
Makes me look a little old.

42:36.015 --> 42:39.819
Makes me almost
in the prime of life?

42:39.854 --> 42:44.046
I don't observe any alteration
in your Lordship's appearance.

42:44.081 --> 42:45.742
You don't?

42:45.777 --> 42:47.404
No, my Lord.

42:49.390 --> 42:51.081
Hmm, very well.

42:56.718 --> 42:57.963
Oh my God!

42:57.998 --> 43:00.622
Father,
how delightful to see you.

43:00.657 --> 43:01.291
Take my cloak off.

43:01.326 --> 43:02.862
Er, is it really worthwhile,
father?

43:02.897 --> 43:04.427
Of course it's worthwhile, sir.

43:04.462 --> 43:08.141
Ah, but you see I'm afraid I've recently
made a resolution not to have visitors...

43:08.176 --> 43:10.573
on Thursday between er,
seven and nine in the evening.

43:10.608 --> 43:13.485
Glad to hear it.
Can't stand interruptions.

43:13.520 --> 43:14.925
No draught, I hope,
in this room.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.747
No, sir.

43:17.005 --> 43:18.828
I feel a draught, sir.
I feel it distinctly.

43:18.863 --> 43:19.882
So do I, sir.

43:19.917 --> 43:22.983
A dreadful draught, sir.
Why don't you go home?

43:23.469 --> 43:25.901
I will come and see you tomorrow and we
can talk about anything you like then.

43:25.936 --> 43:29.546
I have called this evening
with a definite purpose...

43:29.581 --> 43:32.940
and I'm going to see it through at all
cost to my health or yours.

43:32.975 --> 43:35.079
Put my cloak down, sir.

43:35.436 --> 43:37.130
I hate seeing things through,
father

43:37.165 --> 43:40.556
especially when it's
through someone else's eyes.

43:40.591 --> 43:42.441
'Fraid I don't follow you there.
sir.

43:42.476 --> 43:44.647
Well, as far as I can make out, you
seem to follow me everywhere, father.

43:45.100 --> 43:46.049
I'll take that...

43:47.596 --> 43:49.289
Oh God!

43:49.324 --> 43:50.892
Good evening, Arthur.

43:50.927 --> 43:51.817
My dear Robert.

43:51.852 --> 43:54.444
The fact is I really am
horribly busy tonight.

43:54.479 --> 43:57.259
But, Arthur,
I must speak with you.

43:58.380 --> 44:01.260
Gertrude has
discovered the truth?

44:01.295 --> 44:03.365
Yes, I'm afraid she has.

44:05.515 --> 44:07.816
Come in, Robert. Come in.

44:07.851 --> 44:09.992
But, if you wouldn't mind
waiting for a short while...

44:10.027 --> 44:15.083
I'm afraid I'm right in the middle of
giving my performance of the attentive son.

44:15.118 --> 44:16.327
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:16.362 --> 44:17.537
Hmm, so am I.

44:20.395 --> 44:21.409
Phipps.

44:28.970 --> 44:29.897
God!

44:30.186 --> 44:33.994
When you left this afternoon
my life fell apart.

44:34.029 --> 44:36.075
My love is in ruins.

44:36.110 --> 44:38.087
I need you after all.

44:38.122 --> 44:41.089
I am coming to you now Gertrude.

44:41.641 --> 44:44.665
There is a lady coming to see me
this evening on particular business.

44:44.700 --> 44:47.690
Show her into the drawing room when
she arrives. Do you understand?

44:47.725 --> 44:48.742
Ah, yes, my Lord.

44:48.777 --> 44:50.730
This is a matter of
the gravest importance.

44:50.765 --> 44:52.039
I understand, my Lord.

44:52.074 --> 44:55.114
No one else is to be admitted
under any circumstances.

44:55.149 --> 44:56.107
Tell them I'm not at home.

44:56.142 --> 44:57.065
I understand, my Lord.

44:57.100 --> 44:58.283
Good.

44:58.318 --> 44:59.431
Arthur?

44:59.466 --> 45:00.742
Yes, father.

45:08.745 --> 45:10.752
Good evening, Phipps.

45:11.305 --> 45:14.021
How nice to see you again, madam.

45:19.336 --> 45:22.920
His Lordship is engaged at present
with Lord Caversham, madam.

45:22.955 --> 45:25.375
How very filial.

45:25.608 --> 45:28.517
His Lordship told me to ask you,
madam...

45:28.552 --> 45:32.424
Er, to be kind enough, Er,
to wait in the drawing room for him.

45:32.459 --> 45:34.312
His Lordship will come to you there.

45:34.347 --> 45:36.711
Lord Goring expects me?

45:36.746 --> 45:38.021
Yes, madam.

45:38.631 --> 45:40.068
Are you quite sure?

45:40.103 --> 45:44.424
His Lordship's directions
on the subject were very precise.

45:44.459 --> 45:47.271
No, I don't care for that lamp.
It is far too glaring.

45:47.306 --> 45:48.804
Light some candles.

45:48.839 --> 45:50.302
Certainly, madam.

45:51.367 --> 45:54.407
Marriage
is not a matter of affection...

45:54.442 --> 45:56.772
it is a question of common sense.

45:56.807 --> 46:00.839
Yes, but women who have common sense
are usually so curiously plain.

46:00.874 --> 46:02.948
Of course I'm only speaking
from hearsay.

46:02.983 --> 46:04.935
No woman, plain or pretty, has any
sense are so plain, aren't they, father.

46:04.970 --> 46:06.691
Common sense is a privilege
of our sex.

46:06.726 --> 46:10.375
Quite so and we men are so
self-sacrificing we never use it,

46:10.410 --> 46:11.332
do we, father?

46:11.367 --> 46:13.958
I use it, sir.
I use nothing else.

46:13.993 --> 46:15.172
Mum, so my mother tells me.

46:15.207 --> 46:17.956
It is the secret of
your mother's happiness.

46:18.310 --> 46:19.968
What was that?

46:21.862 --> 46:23.902
Nothing, father. Nothing.

46:24.582 --> 46:28.134
You are heartless, sir
Very heartless.

46:28.169 --> 46:30.306
Oh, I hope not, father.

46:35.430 --> 46:40.350
When you left this afternoon
my life fell apart...

46:45.797 --> 46:49.114
I am coming to you now
Gertrude.

46:49.606 --> 46:51.515
There we are, madam.

46:57.285 --> 46:58.210
Thank you.

46:58.245 --> 46:59.423
Thank you, madam.

47:20.452 --> 47:24.608
I'm afraid His Lordship's not
at home this evening, milady.

47:27.908 --> 47:29.217
I, I see.

47:29.252 --> 47:31.837
I'm sorry, Lady Chiltern.

47:32.644 --> 47:33.953
Not at all.

47:42.595 --> 47:44.734
...as you keep saying.

47:46.756 --> 47:48.226
Is in there?

47:48.261 --> 47:49.697
Yes, my Lord.

47:55.203 --> 47:56.893
Oh, my dear fellow.

47:57.218 --> 48:01.146
I'm sorry, Arthur,
I didn't know where else to go.

48:07.715 --> 48:10.300
I don't know what to do,
Arthur.

48:10.786 --> 48:15.074
Robert, last night
you were telling me...

48:15.109 --> 48:17.218
how much Gertrude
means to you, hmm?

48:17.253 --> 48:19.647
How much you love her.

48:19.682 --> 48:21.657
More than anything
in the world.

48:22.818 --> 48:25.090
But there is a wide gulf
between us now...

48:25.125 --> 48:27.937
and I fear I shall never bridge it.

48:28.482 --> 48:30.559
I fear she will never forgive me.

48:30.594 --> 48:34.178
Surely there must be some sin in her
past life. Any sin...

48:34.213 --> 48:36.514
weakness, perhaps, that might well...

48:36.549 --> 48:38.143
help her to understand yours.

48:38.178 --> 48:42.017
No, I don't believe Gertrude knows
what weakness or temptation is.

48:42.052 --> 48:45.490
But she loves you, Robert.
She cannot but forgive you.

48:45.525 --> 48:48.929
Now I feel certain
that if she could hear you now...

48:48.964 --> 48:51.489
the regret you feel about
your past...

48:51.524 --> 48:52.699
Regret?

48:54.368 --> 48:56.062
Yes, regret...

48:56.097 --> 48:59.389
I feel certain that
she would pity you.

48:59.424 --> 49:02.320
Perhaps even at this moment
she is pitying you.

49:02.355 --> 49:05.217
Praying that she might
once again be in your arms.

49:05.252 --> 49:07.900
God grant it but I doubt it.

49:09.536 --> 49:12.438
There is something else
I need to tell you about.

49:13.024 --> 49:17.279
The debate on the Argentine canal
is to begin at ten thirty.

49:17.600 --> 49:20.666
I have made up my mind
what I'm going to say.

49:21.247 --> 49:23.997
I have decided...

49:28.704 --> 49:29.849
What was that?

49:30.911 --> 49:32.220
Nothing.

49:33.087 --> 49:35.424
I heard a noise from next door.

49:35.459 --> 49:37.398
No, no you didn't.

49:40.927 --> 49:42.651
Is there someone there?

49:43.871 --> 49:44.668
Arthur?

49:44.703 --> 49:46.684
Robert... you're excited,
unnerved.

49:46.719 --> 49:49.887
There is no-one in that room. Now
sit down, old man, for God's sake!

49:49.922 --> 49:51.135
Do you give me
your word of honor?

49:51.170 --> 49:52.695
Oh, yes!

49:55.839 --> 49:57.438
Let me look for myself.

49:57.473 --> 49:58.043
Oh, Robert...

49:58.078 --> 49:59.679
If there is no-one there
then why shouldn't I look?

49:59.714 --> 50:03.323
Robert... there is someone
in that room.

50:07.263 --> 50:08.603
My dear fellow,
I do apologise but

50:08.638 --> 50:12.126
I must state she's entirely
guiltless in this matter.

50:12.161 --> 50:16.382
She is scheming
devious and deceitful.

50:16.417 --> 50:17.373
I beg your pardon?

50:17.408 --> 50:19.577
And you...

50:20.542 --> 50:23.486
you are false as a friend
... and treacherous.

50:23.521 --> 50:24.058
Robert!

50:24.093 --> 50:25.915
Good evening, Lord Goring.

50:26.558 --> 50:27.932
Sir Robert.

50:28.478 --> 50:31.641
So tell me, Goring, how the devil do
you explain her presence here?

50:34.398 --> 50:35.931
To be quite honest, I can't I...

50:35.966 --> 50:38.362
I take you two have been
planning this for some time.

50:38.397 --> 50:41.021
Look, Robert believes me, we have
not. We have never planned anything.

50:41.056 --> 50:42.938
Except marriage, of course,
Lord Goring.

50:42.973 --> 50:46.557
Come now, Arthur, you can't have forgotten
we were engaged for at least three weeks.

50:46.592 --> 50:48.090
Yes, but...

50:48.125 --> 50:51.709
At this moment I find it hard to see why
on earth you broke it off. You seem to be...

50:51.744 --> 50:53.660
entirely well suited to each other.

50:53.695 --> 50:55.165
Robert, I give you my word...

50:55.200 --> 50:56.539
No, sir.

50:57.660 --> 50:59.067
Oh no, sir.

51:00.892 --> 51:05.529
You have lied enough upon your
word of honor.

51:09.948 --> 51:12.697
I appear to have caused
something of a commotion.

51:17.051 --> 51:18.262
Goodnight, Sir Robert.

51:33.051 --> 51:38.843
You've come here to sell me
Robert Chiltern's letter.

51:38.878 --> 51:40.763
To offer it to you on condition.

51:40.798 --> 51:43.032
How did you guess?

51:43.322 --> 51:45.850
What is your price for it?

51:45.885 --> 51:47.320
My price...

51:47.355 --> 51:50.584
I've arrived
at the romantic stage.

51:51.162 --> 51:54.570
When I saw you the other night
at the Chilterns'...

51:54.605 --> 51:57.978
I knew you were the only person
I'd ever cared for.

51:58.013 --> 52:01.722
If I've ever cared for anybody,
Arthur.

52:01.757 --> 52:03.249
So...

52:05.114 --> 52:08.633
on the morning
of the day that you marry me...

52:08.668 --> 52:11.830
I will give you
Robert Chiltern's letter.

52:13.882 --> 52:15.638
That is my offer.

52:18.553 --> 52:19.930
Are you quite serious?

52:19.965 --> 52:20.919
Yes.

52:20.954 --> 52:22.645
Quite serious.

52:23.257 --> 52:26.705
My dear Mrs. Cheveley.

52:27.449 --> 52:29.753
I'm afraid I should make you
a very bad husband.

52:29.788 --> 52:32.377
I don't mind bad husbands,
I've had two

52:32.412 --> 52:34.743
They amuse me immensely.

52:35.512 --> 52:39.864
Here is a chance to rise to great
heights of self-sacrifice, Arthur.

52:39.899 --> 52:41.589
I think you should.

52:41.624 --> 52:45.401
And the rest of your life you could spend
in contemplating your own perfections.

52:45.436 --> 52:47.446
I do that as it is.

52:47.481 --> 52:49.269
For the privilege of
being your wife...

52:49.304 --> 52:54.290
I am ready to sacrifice the greatest
prize in my possession.

52:58.008 --> 52:59.252
I'm honored.

53:04.152 --> 53:05.685
Arthur...

53:05.720 --> 53:09.560
you loved me once
you asked me to be your wife...

53:09.595 --> 53:11.604
ask me again.

53:11.639 --> 53:13.613
Ask me now.

53:19.895 --> 53:21.422
Bonsoir.

53:30.071 --> 53:32.035
My dear Mrs. Cheveley.

53:32.070 --> 53:33.999
My dear Lord Goring.

53:37.366 --> 53:39.924
Now I'm going to give you
some good advice.

53:39.959 --> 53:42.295
Pray, don't. One should never give a woman
anything she can't wear in the evening.

53:42.330 --> 53:44.854
Oh, I'm sorry but I don't seem
to be able to stop myself.

53:44.889 --> 53:48.871
Now, I'm going to tell you...
that love...

53:48.906 --> 53:52.819
about which I admit I know
so little...

53:52.854 --> 53:56.531
love cannot be bought.
It can only be given.

53:56.566 --> 54:00.597
And I sense it is not
in my power to give to you.

54:00.632 --> 54:05.014
And nor is it in yours I suspect...

54:05.049 --> 54:05.491
at all.

54:05.526 --> 54:09.300
Dear boy,
you underestimate us both.

54:10.901 --> 54:13.040
To give...

54:13.653 --> 54:16.978
and not expect return, hmm?

54:17.013 --> 54:20.658
That is what lies
at the heart of love.

54:20.693 --> 54:25.397
I fear though the notion
is a stranger to us both.

54:25.432 --> 54:27.154
And yet...

54:27.189 --> 54:28.882
if we are honest...

54:28.917 --> 54:31.922
it is something we both long for

54:31.957 --> 54:36.626
something that it takes
great courage to do.

54:36.980 --> 54:42.577
Yes that is our dark secret.

54:42.612 --> 54:46.507
Your coming here tonight is
the first whisper of it.

54:47.060 --> 54:49.995
And for that I admire you.

54:50.324 --> 54:52.528
Give me the letter.

54:52.980 --> 54:58.740
Prove your affections to me
and give me the letter.

54:58.775 --> 55:02.384
And surrender my position
of power?

55:02.643 --> 55:05.843
The future of a great man is
in your hands, Mrs. Cheveley.

55:05.878 --> 55:09.716
Crush him and your power dies
with him...

55:09.751 --> 55:13.555
as will any feeling
I've ever had for you.

55:13.590 --> 55:15.562
If you ever loved me...

55:19.347 --> 55:20.874
I did love you.

55:21.171 --> 55:23.921
I know, I know.

55:29.907 --> 55:31.630
But not that much.

55:34.611 --> 55:37.927
I know, I must admit
I never thought you did.

55:38.195 --> 55:41.103
Even so, I felt it worth a try.

55:41.138 --> 55:44.210
I understand and respect
you all the more for the attempt.

55:44.245 --> 55:46.447
And I take it you reject
my offer?

55:46.482 --> 55:52.592
I fear I must when tempting
as it seems... in truth...

55:53.746 --> 55:55.474
...it is little
more than blackmail.

55:55.509 --> 55:56.750
True.

56:04.913 --> 56:06.385
Gertrude!

56:06.420 --> 56:07.823
Mabel.

56:07.858 --> 56:10.705
I suddenly remembered
you were due to meet Arthur.

56:10.740 --> 56:13.245
Oh,
at least somebody remembered.

56:13.280 --> 56:15.750
You mean he's not here either?

56:17.425 --> 56:18.766
Oh strange.

56:19.313 --> 56:21.233
Gertrude, are you quite well?

56:21.268 --> 56:23.175
Me? Yes, of course

56:24.657 --> 56:26.566
No, I'm not at all.

56:28.752 --> 56:30.061
Could we talk?

56:30.352 --> 56:32.992
Everything I have ever learned,
indeed all that I believe,

56:33.027 --> 56:35.632
leads me to reject and revile
him for what he has done.

56:35.667 --> 56:36.785
And yet...

56:36.820 --> 56:37.869
And yet?

56:37.904 --> 56:43.152
...I have never known such joy
as when I'm with him.

56:43.187 --> 56:45.613
I've never felt so...

56:45.648 --> 56:49.325
free as when I'm lying in his arms.

56:51.856 --> 56:54.512
Well, Arthur, I shall look out
for you at the Commons...

56:54.547 --> 56:57.168
where at least I'll see your friend
submit to my desires.

56:57.203 --> 56:58.668
I wouldn't be too sure.

56:58.703 --> 57:01.772
Come now, we both know how dearly
he values his career.

57:01.807 --> 57:03.727
I look froward to him proving
you wrong I anticipate it keenly.

57:03.762 --> 57:08.079
In fact, I'd stake my shirt on it.

57:08.114 --> 57:09.260
Your shirt?

57:09.295 --> 57:13.071
Indeed I think I'd probably wager
my entire wardrobe on his integrity.

57:13.106 --> 57:14.860
What confidence.

57:14.895 --> 57:17.164
Would you stake your liberty?

57:17.871 --> 57:19.278
My liberty?

57:19.951 --> 57:22.671
A rather charming little idea
has sprung into my head...

57:22.706 --> 57:24.012
and now I consider it,

57:24.047 --> 57:27.821
I discover it to be
a rather charming, big idea.

57:28.335 --> 57:29.578
Go on.

57:30.222 --> 57:34.251
If as you suggest,
he stands by his principles...

57:34.286 --> 57:37.358
condemns the scheme in question,
then shall I give you his letter.

57:37.393 --> 57:40.173
...to dispose of as you choose.

57:40.208 --> 57:41.963
But if as I project...

57:41.998 --> 57:45.581
he surrenders to my demands,
and publicly supports the scheme

57:45.616 --> 57:47.010
then...

57:47.501 --> 57:49.390
then shall I give you my hand
in marriage.

57:49.425 --> 57:50.635
Precisely.

57:50.670 --> 57:51.947
To dispose of as you please.

57:51.982 --> 57:56.541
As a better man, you must concede
there is a certain thrill to it.

57:56.576 --> 58:01.101
Concede too how elegantly I've eased
from proposal to proposition.

58:01.136 --> 58:04.109
And with barely any loss of face.
I'm most impressed indeed.

58:04.144 --> 58:07.109
We are creatures of compromise,
you and I.

58:08.045 --> 58:11.789
I await your response. You're all of a sudden
less certain of your friend's true nature...

58:11.824 --> 58:14.658
when your own future
rests upon it.

58:16.204 --> 58:19.405
Not at all I accept
your wager in all confidence.

58:19.440 --> 58:20.926
You do?

58:20.961 --> 58:22.377
I do.

58:22.412 --> 58:23.882
Oh, Arthur...

58:23.917 --> 58:27.943
isn't it remarkable how those two
little words can quicken the heart?

58:29.229 --> 58:33.545
Would you do something for me,
Gertrude?

58:33.580 --> 58:35.497
Would you accompany me to
the House of Commons?

58:35.532 --> 58:39.131
I believe there is a rather
interesting debate there tonight.

58:39.166 --> 58:42.731
I believe the Prime Minister
himself has taken an interest.

58:42.766 --> 58:45.033
And I believe...

58:45.068 --> 58:48.939
that its outcome will prove
particularly interesting to you.

58:48.974 --> 58:50.368
And to me.

58:52.075 --> 58:53.984
Whatever it may be.

59:10.058 --> 59:11.106
Damn!

59:30.186 --> 59:34.474
The Honourable Member
for Witney.

59:34.509 --> 59:36.042
Good evening, Chiltern.

59:36.077 --> 59:37.670
Prime Minister.

59:37.705 --> 59:40.038
I beg to ask the President of
the Board of Trade...

59:40.073 --> 59:44.106
to what extent he believes
the projected Argentine Canal...

59:44.141 --> 59:47.684
merits the nation's attention
and support.

59:48.937 --> 59:50.661
Mr. Speaker...

59:55.113 --> 59:57.785
I believe this excellent scheme...

59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.050
represents a genuine opportunity...

01:00:00.085 --> 01:00:02.246
to extend our trading routes...

01:00:02.281 --> 01:00:06.921
and to stamp our authority
on an increasingly vital...

01:00:06.956 --> 01:00:09.474
portion of the globe.

01:00:14.632 --> 01:00:16.550
Didn't expect to see you here.

01:00:16.585 --> 01:00:21.887
Nor did I. But I find I have developed a
sudden and very singular interest in politics.

01:00:22.184 --> 01:00:23.777
Married yet?

01:00:24.296 --> 01:00:26.151
Ask me again in half an hour.

01:00:28.584 --> 01:00:29.960
What?

01:00:29.995 --> 01:00:31.301
Nothing.

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:32.519
The Honourable Member
for Cheltenham.

01:00:32.554 --> 01:00:33.669
Arthur...?

01:00:33.704 --> 01:00:37.431
I beg to ask the Under Secretary
for Foreign Affairs...

01:00:37.466 --> 01:00:41.159
to clarify his position
in respect to the proposed scheme.

01:00:41.194 --> 01:00:42.653
Answer.

01:00:45.735 --> 01:00:47.748
Let me first of all thank the...

01:00:47.783 --> 01:00:51.841
Honourable Member for his articulate
contribution to the debate.

01:00:53.895 --> 01:00:57.287
Since I last adressed the House
on this subject...

01:00:57.322 --> 01:01:00.679
I have had the opportunity
to investigate this scheme...

01:01:00.714 --> 01:01:02.532
more thoroughly...

01:01:02.567 --> 01:01:07.869
and to grasp fully the ramifications
of our lending it support.

01:01:10.214 --> 01:01:13.149
I have to inform the House...

01:01:13.638 --> 01:01:15.525
that I was...

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:17.506
mistaken...

01:01:18.566 --> 01:01:20.933
in my original perceptions...

01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:23.870
and that I have now taken
a rather different view.

01:01:37.318 --> 01:01:39.938
I, I find that now
I must agree with...

01:01:39.973 --> 01:01:45.925
my Right Honourable Friend that
this is indeed an excellent scheme.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.088
A genuine... opportunity.

01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:53.154
An opportunity...

01:01:53.189 --> 01:01:56.833
particularly if you happen
to be a corrupt investor...

01:02:01.765 --> 01:02:03.585
a corrupt investor...

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:07.482
with nothing but self-interest
at heart.

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:13.636
For now it is my utter conviction
that this scheme never should have had...

01:02:13.671 --> 01:02:17.189
or should ever have
any chance of success.

01:02:17.224 --> 01:02:20.673
It is a fraud
an infamous fraud at that.

01:02:20.708 --> 01:02:25.726
Our involvement would be a political
fraud of the worst possible kind.

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:32.320
This great nation...

01:02:32.355 --> 01:02:35.393
has long been
a great commercial power.

01:02:35.428 --> 01:02:39.843
Now it seems there exists a growing
compulsion to use that power...

01:02:39.878 --> 01:02:42.368
merely to beget more power.

01:02:42.403 --> 01:02:46.656
Money merely to beget
more money...

01:02:46.691 --> 01:02:50.466
irrespective of the true
cost to the nation's soul.

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:54.207
And it is this sickness,
a kind of moral blindness...

01:02:54.242 --> 01:03:00.322
...commerce without conscience, which threatens
to strike at the very soul of this nation.

01:03:00.357 --> 01:03:04.251
And the only remedy that I can see
is to strike back and to strike now!

01:03:06.722 --> 01:03:11.807
Hear, hear!

01:03:14.114 --> 01:03:18.658
As we stand as we stand
at the end of this most...

01:03:18.693 --> 01:03:21.151
eventful century...

01:03:21.186 --> 01:03:24.353
it seems that we do,
after all, have...

01:03:24.388 --> 01:03:26.494
...a genuine opportunity.

01:03:26.529 --> 01:03:30.689
One honest chance to shed our...

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:34.017
sometimes imperfect past...

01:03:34.052 --> 01:03:35.806
to start again...

01:03:35.841 --> 01:03:39.649
to step unshackled
into the next century...

01:03:39.684 --> 01:03:43.904
and to look our future squarely...

01:03:43.939 --> 01:03:47.734
and proudly in the face.

01:03:50.305 --> 01:03:54.298
Order!

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.134
Gentlemen, if you please! Order!

01:04:01.121 --> 01:04:02.779
Order!

01:04:11.072 --> 01:04:14.365
You must agree, it has been
a romantic interlude, Arthur.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.582
You might even confess to some faint
and secret regret at its outcome.

01:04:19.871 --> 01:04:23.552
For I do indeed feel some slight
relief that in the end...

01:04:23.587 --> 01:04:24.671
...Sir Robert has come to no harm.

01:04:24.706 --> 01:04:25.789
Really?

01:04:25.824 --> 01:04:30.143
Oh yes, you see I'm not really
quite as wicked as you suppose.

01:04:30.178 --> 01:04:31.550
Mrs. Cheveley!

01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:35.385
And a lady must always honour
her bets.

01:04:36.127 --> 01:04:38.200
Come back with me, Arthur.

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:42.998
Come back to Vienna.

01:04:44.959 --> 01:04:47.004
Bravo, Sir Robert.

01:04:47.039 --> 01:04:48.926
Seems I underestimated you.

01:04:48.961 --> 01:04:49.563
Robert.

01:04:49.598 --> 01:04:51.391
I'm sorry if I've spoiled
your plans.

01:04:51.426 --> 01:04:52.795
Far more than yet you realize.

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:54.814
Ah, there at least is
some small satisfaction.

01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:56.219
Look, Robert, my dear fellow...

01:04:56.254 --> 01:04:58.261
I have nothing to say to you,
Lord Goring.

01:04:58.942 --> 01:05:01.081
Nor is there anything
I wish to hear.

01:05:13.885 --> 01:05:17.180
I hope that now you are content...

01:05:17.469 --> 01:05:19.582
that I didn't disappoint you.

01:05:19.617 --> 01:05:20.474
Robert, I...

01:05:20.509 --> 01:05:22.939
Let women make
no more ideals of men...

01:05:22.974 --> 01:05:26.429
or they may ruin other lives
as completely as you.

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:29.085
You whom I have loved
so wildly...

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.293
have surely ruined mine.

01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:32.602
Robert...

01:05:33.725 --> 01:05:36.092
I know there is no hope for us now.

01:05:37.405 --> 01:05:39.641
I know you can never forgive me.

01:05:41.853 --> 01:05:45.532
Poor man I almost begin
to feel sorry for him.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:46.618
Sorry?

01:05:46.653 --> 01:05:50.972
Yes, I can't bear to see so upright a
gentleman, so honourable an English gentleman...

01:05:51.007 --> 01:05:53.212
being so shamefully deceived.

01:05:53.247 --> 01:05:54.265
Deceived?

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.857
And on such positively pink paper.

01:05:56.892 --> 01:05:59.576
What are you talking about,
Mrs. Cheveley?

01:05:59.611 --> 01:06:02.260
"I need you after all
I'm coming to you now."

01:06:03.356 --> 01:06:05.688
You stole Gertrude's letter?

01:06:05.723 --> 01:06:08.505
Losing a man is scant cause
for concern...

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.808
but losing a man to her is
another matter entirely.

01:06:10.843 --> 01:06:14.427
And so I feel it only right that Sir
Robert should know, as indeed he shall...

01:06:14.462 --> 01:06:18.737
when the letter arrives at
his office first thing in the morning.

01:06:21.659 --> 01:06:23.547
You've got a good man there,
Gertrude.

01:06:23.582 --> 01:06:25.467
You should try to hold on to him.

01:06:25.502 --> 01:06:26.360
Do you know, Laura...

01:06:26.395 --> 01:06:30.453
it occurs to me this whole business
is really just about you and me.

01:06:35.546 --> 01:06:37.226
Gertrude, I must speak with you.

01:06:37.261 --> 01:06:38.872
Er, er, not now. Arthur.
Please!

01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:41.415
Gertrude, it's about that letter.
The letter you wrote to me!

01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:43.923
...do come round in the morning,
Arthur, I can't talk now.

01:06:45.115 --> 01:06:46.456
Lord Goring?

01:06:49.274 --> 01:06:50.386
Miss Mabel...

01:06:50.714 --> 01:06:51.770
about this evening, I...

01:06:51.805 --> 01:06:53.297
congratulations.

01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:55.639
I beg your pardon?

01:06:55.674 --> 01:06:57.591
I gather you are to
be congratulated.

01:06:57.626 --> 01:07:01.110
Well naturally... there's nothing
I like more than to be congratulated...

01:07:01.145 --> 01:07:05.690
though invariably I find the pleasure
immeasurably increased by knowing what for.

01:07:05.725 --> 01:07:09.018
Oh, haven't you heard?
You're to be married.

01:07:09.053 --> 01:07:10.105
Your father says...

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:10.934
Does he?

01:07:10.969 --> 01:07:12.530
Yes, he does.

01:07:13.689 --> 01:07:16.144
Did he, by any chance,
tell you to who?

01:07:16.537 --> 01:07:17.974
No.

01:07:18.009 --> 01:07:20.313
But when we saw you with
that woman Mrs. Cheeseley

01:07:20.348 --> 01:07:21.561
we naturally assumed...

01:07:21.596 --> 01:07:23.002
Oh, did we?

01:07:23.037 --> 01:07:24.374
Yes, we did.

01:07:24.409 --> 01:07:26.806
Well the fact is...

01:07:26.841 --> 01:07:29.944
your assumptions
are presumptuous.

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:31.668
You see...

01:07:32.857 --> 01:07:35.766
I'm not sure...

01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:38.904
that I've seen anything
I quite like the look of yet.

01:07:38.939 --> 01:07:40.933
Oh, really?

01:07:40.968 --> 01:07:42.928
Mum, really.

01:07:43.256 --> 01:07:47.118
In which case I have something
vitally important to say to you.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:54.037
To look at a thing is quite
different form seeing a thing.

01:07:54.455 --> 01:07:59.758
And one does not see anything
until one sees its beauty.

01:08:01.687 --> 01:08:04.273
Yes. Really.

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:10.099
Oh, Mabel

01:08:12.695 --> 01:08:16.720
Do you have something you wish
to say to me, Lord Goring?

01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:25.238
...no, no I don't think so.

01:08:29.622 --> 01:08:31.924
Then I don't wish to hear it.

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:33.971
Goodnight.

01:08:34.006 --> 01:08:37.270
I'm sure that nice Mr. Trafford
will have something to say to me.

01:08:37.305 --> 01:08:38.993
And I'm even surer...

01:08:39.638 --> 01:08:42.027
I will be quite charmed to listen!

01:08:49.398 --> 01:08:50.161
Damn!

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.968
It is a great nuisance.

01:09:04.629 --> 01:09:08.500
Can't find anyone else to talk to and
I'm so full of interesting information.

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:12.000
I feel like the latest
edition of something or other.

01:09:13.429 --> 01:09:14.738
Well...

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.425
after some consideration...

01:09:18.133 --> 01:09:19.857
there's so much to do

01:09:19.892 --> 01:09:22.281
there's only one thing to be done.

01:09:23.892 --> 01:09:28.180
There comes a time in every
son's life when he must, indeed...

01:09:28.215 --> 01:09:30.765
follow his father's advice.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.256
I shall go to bed at once.

01:09:37.652 --> 01:09:40.979
I do hope we see you in the near
future, Mrs. Cheveley.

01:09:41.015 --> 01:09:44.308
Oh, so do I. But I fear,
Lady Markby, that for me...

01:09:44.343 --> 01:09:46.740
the future seems
strangely uncertain.

01:09:46.774 --> 01:09:50.033
And what of the present?

01:09:50.068 --> 01:09:52.019
Well, as a very dear friend once said
to me, "To love oneself...

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:54.771
is the beginning of
a lifelong romance".

01:09:54.806 --> 01:09:56.659
Goodbye, dear Lady Markby.

01:10:00.307 --> 01:10:03.187
London will be the lesser
for your leaving.

01:10:03.222 --> 01:10:05.332
And sadly lacking in scandal.

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:07.408
Ah, but my dear Lady Markby...

01:10:07.443 --> 01:10:10.675
my personal favourite
is shortly to unfold.

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:12.169
Consider it a parting gift.

01:10:12.819 --> 01:10:14.226
Thank you, Mrs. Cheveley.

01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:53.904
May I see it?

01:11:05.617 --> 01:11:10.734
...that is what you were doing
with that woman, Mrs. Cheveley.

01:11:13.616 --> 01:11:15.569
Well it certainly
didn't look that way.

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:16.238
Ah yes,

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:20.713
but there's a great deal of difference between
looking and seeing Isn't there, Miss Mabel?

01:11:23.921 --> 01:11:25.895
Oh, my dear Arthur.

01:11:26.832 --> 01:11:29.582
What a good friend you are
to him.

01:11:29.872 --> 01:11:31.181
To us.

01:11:31.216 --> 01:11:33.997
But the truth is we're not out of
danger yet. In fact...

01:11:34.032 --> 01:11:37.898
I believe there's a rather popular
saying about frying pans and fires...

01:11:37.933 --> 01:11:41.764
only this time it is you and I,
dear Gertrude, who are to be roasted.

01:11:45.711 --> 01:11:47.567
Oh no, Arthur, I, I couldn't.

01:11:47.602 --> 01:11:48.140
No, I couldn't.

01:11:48.175 --> 01:11:50.384
I think it is better that
he should know the exact truth.

01:11:50.419 --> 01:11:54.191
So you want me to tell him that
what?

01:11:54.226 --> 01:11:57.039
That I intended a...

01:11:57.074 --> 01:11:57.612
secret...

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:58.924
a secret rendezvous. Yes.

01:11:58.959 --> 01:12:00.879
With a single man?
And at such an hour?

01:12:00.914 --> 01:12:02.574
You, you want me to tell him that?

01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:04.076
It's scandalous, Arthur!

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:07.726
Well that may be but it's also the truth
and in this case it may be our best option.

01:12:07.761 --> 01:12:10.031
But I'm a married woman.
I couldn't possibly tell him.

01:12:10.066 --> 01:12:11.022
Well then, may I do it?

01:12:11.057 --> 01:12:12.555
Certainly not!

01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:15.662
And you must give me your word,
Arthur, that you never will.

01:12:15.697 --> 01:12:17.189
No, you are wrong, Gertrude!

01:12:19.726 --> 01:12:21.355
But I will give you my word.

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:24.142
That you will never tell me what...

01:12:24.177 --> 01:12:25.484
Lord Goring?

01:12:26.126 --> 01:12:27.206
Robert.

01:12:32.078 --> 01:12:33.572
What does this mean?

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:41.422
I, Robert, I, I meant to give
it to you last night But...

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:42.632
Last night?

01:12:44.302 --> 01:12:47.693
Yes, when Gertrude sent it over
but you left in such a hurry...

01:12:47.728 --> 01:12:49.290
Oh, then, then...

01:12:49.325 --> 01:12:50.667
so this letter is intended
for me?

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:54.900
Well, of co...

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.500
Oh my goodness...

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.373
you didn't think, you couldn't
possibly think that, you know...

01:13:04.364 --> 01:13:06.249
The name, the, um...

01:13:06.284 --> 01:13:09.186
the address on the envelope
is yours...

01:13:09.932 --> 01:13:13.036
She knew that when you left here you
would come to me at once, obviously.

01:13:13.071 --> 01:13:15.076
Well, it stands to reason old man,
come on.

01:13:18.348 --> 01:13:20.171
It's true, Robert.

01:13:20.206 --> 01:13:21.995
I delivered it myself.

01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:28.171
You did? You did.

01:13:28.206 --> 01:13:29.698
Certainly.

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:37.163
As you will remember, Gertrude after
my rehearsals I called in for tea.

01:13:37.198 --> 01:13:39.656
And, when you mentioned
the letter...

01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:43.212
I remarked that I was shortly to meet up
with Lord Goring as we had an appointment...

01:13:43.247 --> 01:13:45.740
to visit the new Modern Art
exhibition at the Grosvenor...

01:13:45.775 --> 01:13:48.619
which, quite frankly,
apart from two studies in grey

01:13:48.654 --> 01:13:50.664
by Whistler,
was exceedingly forgettable.

01:13:50.699 --> 01:13:53.259
And that's exactly what
lord goring then proceeded to do.

01:13:53.294 --> 01:13:56.171
Namely forget it...
before he even saw it.

01:13:56.206 --> 01:13:58.821
For, you see, he never appeared.

01:13:59.115 --> 01:14:03.754
A fact which I find most upsetting, both
on behalf of myself and Mr. Whistler.

01:14:03.789 --> 01:14:06.143
And we're both deciding whether
or not to forgive him.

01:14:06.634 --> 01:14:11.391
In the meantime I delivered the letter
myself to your office this morning.

01:14:11.659 --> 01:14:14.522
And you know
the fact of the matter is...

01:14:14.557 --> 01:14:17.386
I still haven't heard
a word of apology!

01:14:17.738 --> 01:14:20.154
Umm. Sorry.

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:22.083
I forgive you.

01:14:22.118 --> 01:14:23.977
Thank you.

01:14:24.778 --> 01:14:26.022
Is this true?

01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:43.433
"When you left...

01:14:43.468 --> 01:14:45.572
my life...

01:14:46.409 --> 01:14:49.725
my life fell apart."

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.157
"I need you after all."

01:14:55.113 --> 01:14:58.015
Your life fell apart, Gertrude?

01:15:02.281 --> 01:15:03.557
Yes.

01:15:07.304 --> 01:15:09.955
You, you need me, Gertrude?

01:15:11.496 --> 01:15:13.061
Yes.

01:15:13.096 --> 01:15:15.976
Why did you not say
that you loved me?

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.951
Oh, because I love you!

01:15:19.719 --> 01:15:21.829
I, I do not care what...

01:15:21.864 --> 01:15:24.839
what punishment or disgrace
is in store for me.

01:15:24.874 --> 01:15:26.757
This letter of yours, Gertrude...

01:15:26.792 --> 01:15:31.303
makes me feel that nothing that the
world can do can harm me now.

01:15:31.338 --> 01:15:35.459
There's no disgrace in store for you,
nor any public shame.

01:15:39.975 --> 01:15:42.884
I...

01:15:42.919 --> 01:15:44.036
I, I don't understand.

01:15:44.071 --> 01:15:47.420
We have much to thank him for,
Robert.

01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:50.935
When I finished
my speech last night, I...

01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:53.924
felt sure that
my future was in ruins.

01:15:53.959 --> 01:15:55.998
And when you began it
I wasn't so sure about my own.

01:15:56.454 --> 01:15:58.429
I don't know how to thank you.

01:16:00.614 --> 01:16:02.240
I'm sure I'll think of something.

01:16:03.623 --> 01:16:07.452
Er, in the meantime I'd be
grateful for the return of my hand.

01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:13.437
Miss Mabel.

01:16:17.894 --> 01:16:19.235
Miss Mabel.

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:21.280
Miss Mabel, wait.

01:16:25.573 --> 01:16:27.712
I, er...

01:16:27.941 --> 01:16:31.333
I have something
very particular to say to you.

01:16:31.368 --> 01:16:32.860
Is it a proposal?

01:16:34.725 --> 01:16:37.627
Well. Yes, it is.

01:16:38.661 --> 01:16:40.188
It is?

01:16:42.213 --> 01:16:44.068
I, I think it is.

01:16:44.325 --> 01:16:45.885
Well yes or no?

01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:47.205
Well, actually, yes.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.869
I'm afraid it is.

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:49.858
I'm so glad.

01:16:49.893 --> 01:16:51.973
That makes the second one
today.

01:16:52.008 --> 01:16:53.121
What?

01:16:53.156 --> 01:16:53.954
Oh dear, not...?

01:16:53.989 --> 01:16:55.553
Yes... Tommy Trafford.

01:16:55.588 --> 01:16:57.442
It is one of Tommy's days
for proposing.

01:16:57.477 --> 01:17:00.740
He always proposes on Thursdays
during the season.

01:17:00.775 --> 01:17:03.140
Ah... but today is Friday.

01:17:03.175 --> 01:17:04.065
I know.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.627
Today is special.

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:10.169
Well, you didn't accept him,
did you?

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:14.238
I shall be in the conservatory under
the second palm tree on the right.

01:17:16.676 --> 01:17:18.340
The second palm tree
on the right?

01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:21.656
The usual palm tree.

01:17:21.891 --> 01:17:23.549
And then we'll see how you do.

01:17:24.675 --> 01:17:25.657
The usual?

01:17:28.067 --> 01:17:29.627
Well, sir,
what are you doing here?

01:17:30.307 --> 01:17:32.827
Wasting your time as usual.

01:17:33.699 --> 01:17:35.936
My dear father...
when one pays a visit...

01:17:35.971 --> 01:17:38.691
it is for the purpose of wasting
other people's time and not one's own.

01:17:38.726 --> 01:17:39.712
What are you doing here?

01:17:39.747 --> 01:17:41.754
I've important news for Chiltern.

01:17:44.898 --> 01:17:46.271
A seat in the Cabinet.

01:17:46.306 --> 01:17:48.255
Certainly,
and you well deserve it too.

01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:50.723
You have got what we want
so much in policical life nowadays...

01:17:50.758 --> 01:17:54.015
high character high moral tone

01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:57.399
Everything that you have not got, sir,
and never will have.

01:18:08.546 --> 01:18:12.986
I... cannot accept this offer,
Lord Caversham.

01:18:13.762 --> 01:18:15.938
I have decided to decline it.

01:18:15.973 --> 01:18:17.758
Decline it, sir?

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:20.849
It is my intention to retire
at once from public life.

01:18:20.884 --> 01:18:23.870
Decline a seat in the Cabinet
and retire from public life?

01:18:23.905 --> 01:18:27.649
I never heard such damned nonsense
in the whole course of my existence!

01:18:27.684 --> 01:18:29.918
Oh, I beg your pardon,
lady Chiltern.

01:18:29.953 --> 01:18:33.116
Will you kindly prevent
your husband from making such a...

01:18:33.151 --> 01:18:36.280
I think my husband is right,
Lord Caversham. I agree with him.

01:18:36.801 --> 01:18:38.830
You agree? Good heavens.

01:18:38.865 --> 01:18:40.860
I admire him for it.

01:18:41.089 --> 01:18:43.772
I admire him immensely for it.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:49.174
I shall write at once to
the Prime Minister.

01:18:50.784 --> 01:18:52.672
If you'll excuse me for a moment,
Lord Caversham.

01:18:52.707 --> 01:18:54.265
Lord Caversham.

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:59.482
What is the matter
with this family?

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.077
There's something wrong here... eh?

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:06.422
Idiocy. Hereditary perhaps...
Both of them too.

01:19:06.912 --> 01:19:09.279
Very sad. Very sad indeed.

01:19:09.856 --> 01:19:12.507
They're not an old family.

01:19:12.767 --> 01:19:14.076
I can't understand it.

01:19:15.135 --> 01:19:18.367
Oh well, suppose I'd better go back
to the Prime Minister and tell him

01:19:18.402 --> 01:19:19.804
Chiltern's the damnedest fool I ever
met and won't take the seat.

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:23.103
Oh no, father, I would rather you did not
quite. I'd rather you,took a seat yourself?

01:19:23.138 --> 01:19:24.924
Why are you prating about?

01:19:24.959 --> 01:19:27.503
Why don't you go in there
for a while, father, hmm?

01:19:27.538 --> 01:19:30.047
The second palm tree to the right,
The usual palm.

01:19:30.082 --> 01:19:30.876
What?

01:19:30.911 --> 01:19:32.671
There's somebody
I want you to talk to.

01:19:32.706 --> 01:19:33.696
What about?

01:19:33.731 --> 01:19:34.686
About me, sir.

01:19:34.721 --> 01:19:35.864
Hmmm?

01:19:36.927 --> 01:19:39.960
Not a subject on which
much eloquence is possible.

01:19:47.102 --> 01:19:48.084
Gertrude.

01:19:54.174 --> 01:19:59.133
Yes, Arthur, it is Robert himself
who wishes to retire from public life.

01:19:59.168 --> 01:19:59.675
Really.

01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:00.666
It was he who first said so.

01:20:00.701 --> 01:20:02.590
Rather than lose your love
he would do anything

01:20:02.625 --> 01:20:04.285
Has he not been punished enough?

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.558
We've both been punished.

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:08.762
I set him up too high.

01:20:08.797 --> 01:20:10.970
Do not then set him down
now too low.

01:20:11.005 --> 01:20:14.780
Dear Gertrude, it is not the perfect
but the imperfect who have need of love.

01:20:15.549 --> 01:20:18.173
You seem to know a great deal
about everything all of a sudden.

01:20:18.208 --> 01:20:21.274
I hope not.

01:20:21.309 --> 01:20:23.162
All I do know...

01:20:23.197 --> 01:20:25.997
is that is takes great
courage to see the world

01:20:26.032 --> 01:20:28.762
in all its tainted glory
and still to love it.

01:20:28.797 --> 01:20:31.833
And even more courage to
see it in the one you love.

01:20:31.868 --> 01:20:35.356
Dear Gertrude you have more courage
than any woman I know.

01:20:35.391 --> 01:20:38.323
Do not be afraid to use it.

01:20:59.003 --> 01:21:00.792
Well Lady Caversham
need never know.

01:21:02.747 --> 01:21:03.762
Thank you, father.

01:21:04.155 --> 01:21:05.691
Can't say I hold up
much hope, old man.

01:21:05.726 --> 01:21:06.619
What?

01:21:35.034 --> 01:21:36.016
Lord Goring?

01:21:37.946 --> 01:21:40.280
You have something
you wish to say to me?

01:21:43.994 --> 01:21:45.456
Marry me, M...

01:21:50.362 --> 01:21:52.217
Marry me, Miss Mabel.

01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:56.791
Well... Lord Goring...

01:21:56.826 --> 01:21:59.444
I must say this comes
as quite a surprise.

01:22:00.922 --> 01:22:02.746
Well, if you need time
to consider, I'll just...

01:22:02.781 --> 01:22:03.414
No.

01:22:03.449 --> 01:22:06.201
No, I don't need time,
I need a reason.

01:22:06.236 --> 01:22:07.281
What?

01:22:08.058 --> 01:22:11.832
A reason why you think
I should marry you.

01:22:13.145 --> 01:22:15.349
Oh, umm...

01:22:20.729 --> 01:22:22.116
A reason you say?

01:22:22.151 --> 01:22:23.503
A good one... yes.

01:22:24.665 --> 01:22:25.428
Robert.

01:22:28.824 --> 01:22:30.285
May I?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.276
Of course.

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:40.853
Gertrude.

01:22:40.888 --> 01:22:43.987
It is more than enough to know that
you would sacrifice it when I asked.

01:22:45.047 --> 01:22:48.951
We have, all of us,
feet of clay, Robert.

01:22:48.986 --> 01:22:51.407
Women as well as men.

01:22:54.424 --> 01:22:56.246
Can it be that...

01:22:57.016 --> 01:22:59.317
That you've forgiven me?

01:23:01.399 --> 01:23:04.181
I sup...
I suppose it must be that.

01:23:05.623 --> 01:23:07.761
Oh goodness.

01:23:08.855 --> 01:23:10.611
Hold me, Robert.

01:23:14.839 --> 01:23:16.657
Forgive me.

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:18.476
Gertrude.

01:23:19.926 --> 01:23:25.393
Gertrude, my wife.

01:23:33.046 --> 01:23:35.696
I love you.

01:23:36.758 --> 01:23:38.481
I love you.

01:23:40.342 --> 01:23:42.006
Is that your reason?

01:23:42.041 --> 01:23:44.045
Hmm.

01:23:44.438 --> 01:23:47.023
I love you.

01:23:48.021 --> 01:23:49.107
I said

01:23:49.142 --> 01:23:50.037
Mabel I said...

01:23:50.072 --> 01:23:51.892
I, I know.

01:23:52.245 --> 01:23:53.936
Well...

01:23:54.421 --> 01:23:55.915
Couldn't you...

01:23:57.333 --> 01:23:59.308
Love me just
a little bit in return?

01:24:01.205 --> 01:24:04.107
Arthur... you silly...

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:07.381
If you knew anything about
anything... which you don't...

01:24:07.416 --> 01:24:12.148
You'd know that
I absolutely adore you.

01:24:12.183 --> 01:24:13.642
Really?

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:18.129
Well... why didn't you
mention it before?

01:24:18.965 --> 01:24:21.812
Because... dear boy...

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.365
You never would
have believed me.

01:24:50.675 --> 01:24:52.530
What the devil's going on
in this house?

01:24:59.571 --> 01:25:01.136
Congratulations!

01:25:01.171 --> 01:25:04.979
If the country doesn't go to the dogs or
the radicals we'll have you prime Minister!

01:25:05.014 --> 01:25:05.968
Thank you, Lord Caversham.

01:25:06.003 --> 01:25:09.523
And Arthur... I only wish there was
something I could do to repay you.

01:25:09.558 --> 01:25:12.457
Well, Robert...
as a matter of fact there is.

01:25:13.106 --> 01:25:15.471
You are your sister's guardian.

01:25:15.506 --> 01:25:17.523
I should like your consent
to our marriage, that is all.

01:25:17.558 --> 01:25:19.408
Oh, I'm so glad.

01:25:19.443 --> 01:25:20.850
You wish to marry Mabel?

01:25:20.885 --> 01:25:21.871
Yes.

01:25:21.906 --> 01:25:24.906
I'm sorry, Arthur, but the thing
is quite out of the question.

01:25:25.426 --> 01:25:26.440
Oh, Robert.

01:25:26.802 --> 01:25:30.962
No, I have to consider
Mabel's future happiness and as...

01:25:30.997 --> 01:25:33.327
Much as I care for you, Arthur...

01:25:33.362 --> 01:25:36.433
I don't think her happiness
would be safe in your hands.

01:25:36.468 --> 01:25:37.902
But I love Mabel.

01:25:37.937 --> 01:25:39.563
No other woman has a place
in heart.

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:43.243
Darling, if they truly love each
other, why should they not be married?

01:25:45.617 --> 01:25:46.893
I shall tell you.

01:25:47.953 --> 01:25:49.966
When I called on Lord Goring.

01:25:50.001 --> 01:25:52.622
Yesterday evening I found Mrs.
Cheverley concealed in his rooms.

01:25:52.657 --> 01:25:56.551
I then discovered... that they were
at one time engaged to be married.

01:25:57.265 --> 01:25:58.759
I'm very sorry, Mabel...

01:25:59.472 --> 01:26:02.513
but how can I possibly
allow you to marry him when...

01:26:02.548 --> 01:26:04.945
when he's involved
with another woman?

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.188
I'm sorry, Arthur.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.389
It would be wrong of me.

01:26:10.288 --> 01:26:13.550
It would be unjust to her.

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:23.116
Very well.

01:26:23.151 --> 01:26:24.456
But, Arthur...

01:26:25.616 --> 01:26:26.663
Mabel...

01:26:29.296 --> 01:26:31.205
there is nothing I can say.

01:26:38.704 --> 01:26:39.597
Robert.

01:26:44.463 --> 01:26:47.372
Arthur was as surprised as you...

01:26:47.407 --> 01:26:50.542
to find Mrs. Cheveley
in his rooms last night.

01:26:50.577 --> 01:26:53.063
He was expecting...

01:26:54.382 --> 01:26:56.204
quite another woman.

01:26:56.718 --> 01:27:00.558
Another woman?
What d'you mean?

01:27:00.593 --> 01:27:02.412
Well, the truth is...

01:27:02.447 --> 01:27:05.358
The business about Mabel and,
Er, Mr. Whistler, well...

01:27:05.393 --> 01:27:07.915
you see that was just...

01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:13.327
my friends being kind,
and, umm... protecting me.

01:27:13.362 --> 01:27:16.043
Er well, the truth is...

01:27:16.078 --> 01:27:20.686
when I agreed to the story about the
letter being intended for you and...

01:27:20.721 --> 01:27:24.590
not for Arthur well y...

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:25.834
you see...

01:27:25.869 --> 01:27:28.291
the truth is...

01:27:31.662 --> 01:27:36.135
the truth is...

01:27:37.613 --> 01:27:39.174
I lied!

01:27:43.757 --> 01:27:44.934
Bravo.

01:27:50.797 --> 01:27:52.291
Father!

01:28:05.932 --> 01:28:06.892
I need a drink.

01:28:06.927 --> 01:28:07.840
Me too.

01:28:28.427 --> 01:28:31.788
And if you don't make her an ideal
husband, I'll cut you off with a shilling.

01:28:31.823 --> 01:28:35.399
An ideal husband. I don't think
I should like that.

01:28:35.659 --> 01:28:38.219
What do you want him
to be then, my dear?

01:28:38.254 --> 01:28:40.779
I think he can be whatever
he chooses.

01:28:40.814 --> 01:28:42.408
You don't deserve her, sir.

01:28:42.443 --> 01:28:46.250
My dear father, if we men
married the women we deserved...

01:28:46.285 --> 01:28:49.147
we should have
a very bad time of it.

01:28:49.182 --> 01:28:52.010
You're heartless, sir,
quite heartless.

01:28:52.045 --> 01:28:54.378
Oh, I hope not, sir.

01:28:54.413 --> 01:28:56.287
I hope not.
