00:01.751 --> 00:06.006
[Veronica and Kev moaning]

00:06.047 --> 00:07.465
[Veronica giggles]

00:07.507 --> 00:09.217
Oh, sh--oh, hey.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.844
-Uh, V.
-[Veronica] Yeah?

00:10.885 --> 00:12.721
V.

00:12.762 --> 00:14.014
Did you know they were coming?

00:14.055 --> 00:16.766
No!
Hell no!

00:16.808 --> 00:18.935
'Scuse me.
Can I help you?

00:18.977 --> 00:21.146
Oh, sure, this is
what you're here for?

00:21.187 --> 00:24.399
Okay, here's what happened
last week on  Shameless.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.151
Married people you know
with kids

00:26.192 --> 00:28.820
can still have fantastic sex.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.239
[laughs]
Huh?

00:32.323 --> 00:34.659
Our community
has been infiltrated

00:34.701 --> 00:35.910
by undesirables.

00:35.952 --> 00:36.953
[Kev]  The Milkoviches.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.079
-[yelling]
-[Liam]  We have to move

00:38.121 --> 00:39.831
away from the racists.

00:39.873 --> 00:40.707
Whoa.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.875
It's a good training wheel gun.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.793
Point and shoot,
just like  Call of Duty.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.170
And it's okay
if you shoot a Milkovich.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.129
No one cares.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.881
[Milton]
You know how it is these days.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.424
You gotta scrape together
whatever you can, man.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.633
That doesn't mean
you can kick people

00:50.675 --> 00:51.760
out of their fucking houses.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.678
Are we in a relationship?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.847
[Royal]  Sandy!

00:55.889 --> 00:57.265
-Who's that?
-[Royal]  Sandy!

00:57.307 --> 00:59.851
[sighs]
It's my fucking husband.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.227
-I know you're in there!
-Your what?

01:01.269 --> 01:03.855
Not today, rednecks!

01:03.897 --> 01:04.981
[gunshot]

01:05.023 --> 01:06.524
[groans]
Oh...

01:08.735 --> 01:09.944
[bullet squelches]

01:09.986 --> 01:11.988
rock music

01:12.030 --> 01:14.949
I am poor, unemployed,
and pretty soon,

01:14.991 --> 01:16.201
I'm gonna be homeless.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.661
You know, in the old days,
I'd be at BornFree right now,

01:18.703 --> 01:19.788
stealing everything in sight.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.456
You still got the keys?

01:22.624 --> 01:23.625
Yeah.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.884
rock music

01:36.554 --> 01:39.641
Think of all
the luck you got

01:39.682 --> 01:43.103
Know that
it's not for naught

01:43.144 --> 01:46.147
You were beaming
once before

01:46.189 --> 01:50.777
But it's not like that
anymore

01:50.819 --> 01:54.114
What is this downside

01:54.155 --> 01:57.700
That you speak of?

01:57.742 --> 01:59.410
What is this feeling

01:59.452 --> 02:04.624
You're so sure of?

02:10.713 --> 02:14.300
Round up
the friends you got

02:14.342 --> 02:17.470
Know that
they're not for naught

02:17.512 --> 02:20.515
You were willing
once before

02:20.557 --> 02:25.186
But it's not like that
anymore

02:25.228 --> 02:28.398
What is this downside

02:28.439 --> 02:31.901
That you speak of?

02:31.943 --> 02:33.987
What is this feeling

02:34.028 --> 02:38.324
You're so sure of?

02:38.950 --> 02:41.953
rock music

02:43.788 --> 02:44.789
-[sharp bang]
-Shh!

02:44.831 --> 02:46.875
[Mickey] Fuck!

02:46.916 --> 02:49.085
Darker than Satan's asshole
in here.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.628
We been down
this road before

02:50.670 --> 02:52.338
I already know
what you got in store...

02:54.090 --> 02:55.175
All right, I'ma hit parts.

02:55.216 --> 02:58.219
Mick, grab some bikes,
and, uh, Brad, office.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.597
Lookin' for a place
to live

03:00.638 --> 03:02.807
Wait, why are you using
real names?

03:02.849 --> 03:04.142
[Lip] Hey, relax,
we're gonna take

03:04.184 --> 03:06.603
the security camera.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.730
And what-what if
they bugged the place?

03:08.771 --> 03:12.025
Hey,  Mission Impossible,
less talking, more stealing.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.944
Don't want your money

03:14.986 --> 03:17.822
Ain't nothin' there

03:17.864 --> 03:19.574
What the fuck is this shit?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.159
Now we're standing
face-to-face

03:21.201 --> 03:23.328
Gonna run you right off
outta this place

03:23.369 --> 03:25.955
Ooh, ooh, it's a race

03:25.997 --> 03:27.332
Hey, hey, three grand
in the safe.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.250
Keep it up,
gonna match your pace...

03:29.292 --> 03:30.335
Yo, hey, hey.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.086
Fuck that one.
It's a piece of shit.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.839
Grab some chrome pipes
and carburetors, parts room.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.179
Shit feels expensive.
It's heavy.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.352
Now's your opportunity

03:47.393 --> 03:49.229
To take what you want
and take what you need

03:49.270 --> 03:51.481
[Lip] Hey, what the fuck
you doing?

03:51.522 --> 03:54.275
Making it look
like Mexicans broke in.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.361
Keep it up,
gonna match your pace

03:56.402 --> 03:59.322
[door whirring]

03:59.364 --> 04:01.574
Yeah it's a race

04:01.616 --> 04:02.700
[Brad]
Fucking freezing in here.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.452
Why'd you get
a refrigerated truck?

04:04.494 --> 04:07.872
'Cause, Brad, there's not
a lot of options last-minute.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.542
[Mickey]
Where we fencing this shit?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.670
I don't know.
Out of state, probably.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.296
Wait, you haven't lined up
a fence yet?

04:15.338 --> 04:16.381
No.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.507
Great fucking plan, Lip.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.925
Which one of you geniuses
came up with it?

04:18.967 --> 04:22.011
Well, it was a group effort:
me, Brad, couple of six-packs.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.763
Couple of s--

04:23.805 --> 04:25.265
You off the wagon again?

04:25.306 --> 04:26.557
Yeah, just one night.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.269
"Just one night"--isn't that
what every alcoholic says?

04:29.310 --> 04:32.438
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth...

04:32.480 --> 04:34.941
[Frank] Monica!
Oh, Monica!

04:34.983 --> 04:36.192
[groans]

04:36.234 --> 04:37.735
-[Monica groaning]
-Hop the fuck up, Monny.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.281
You are still the best
I've ever had.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.575
[both groaning]

04:45.952 --> 04:47.745
-Monica!
-Ah!

04:47.787 --> 04:49.122
[Monica giggling]

04:49.163 --> 04:51.165
-Oh, Monica.
-[Monica sighs]

04:51.207 --> 04:52.625
[Monica] Ah...

04:52.667 --> 04:54.210
Do you know what
that's worth?

04:54.252 --> 04:58.298
Ooh, heaven is a place
on Earth...

04:58.339 --> 05:01.259
[Monica breathing hard,
sighing]

05:01.301 --> 05:03.344
[Monica] Shit.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.973
[Frank] Sorry I can't...stay
for another round there,

05:07.015 --> 05:08.141
Monny.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.600
Uh...

05:11.311 --> 05:12.937
I gotta get to work.

05:14.355 --> 05:17.150
Ah.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.192
Hey!

05:18.234 --> 05:21.404
You wanna meet
at The Alibi a little bit later

05:21.446 --> 05:22.739
for, uh, happy hour?
Ha.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.533
[Monica] Sure.
Where do you work?

05:27.869 --> 05:29.120
Uh...

05:29.162 --> 05:30.079
Oh.
[laughs]

05:30.121 --> 05:31.873
I didn't mean to pry, honey.

05:31.914 --> 05:32.915
I'll see you later.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.250
Oh, and, uh,

05:34.292 --> 05:36.044
Frank, honey,

05:36.085 --> 05:38.087
when we're not having sex,

05:38.129 --> 05:40.048
could you use my real name?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.885
Letty?

05:43.926 --> 05:45.011
What?
Uh...

05:45.053 --> 05:47.388
Like, I'm cool with "Monica"
in bed if that's your kink,

05:47.430 --> 05:48.389
but when we're just
hanging out,

05:48.431 --> 05:49.390
it doesn't feel right.

05:49.432 --> 05:52.226
Just...
call me by my name, okay?

05:52.268 --> 05:55.313
tranquil choral music

05:57.982 --> 06:01.361
[voice]  speaking Italian

06:01.402 --> 06:03.446
Um, "bor...jurno"?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.531
Can I speak
to Pope Francis, please?

06:05.573 --> 06:10.912
[voice]  speaking Italian

06:11.537 --> 06:12.538
What's the penance

06:12.580 --> 06:15.333
for accidentally shooting
someone...

06:15.375 --> 06:17.418
if they're alive
but paralyzed?

06:17.460 --> 06:19.629
[voice]  Who is this?

06:19.670 --> 06:21.214
rock music

06:21.255 --> 06:22.840
Ooh, ooh

06:22.882 --> 06:24.634
Ooh

06:24.675 --> 06:26.386
Here we go again...

06:26.427 --> 06:27.970
-[Tami] Ooh.
-[Lip] Hey.

06:28.012 --> 06:30.848
Eggs, bacon, and pancakes.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.266
You fuck someone?

06:32.308 --> 06:34.394
What? No.
I can't make breakfast?

06:34.435 --> 06:35.728
[Tami] Ha.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.605
-Coffee?
-Uh, no, no, I'm good.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.273
I already had six cups.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.401
Jesus.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.111
How long have you been up?

06:43.152 --> 06:44.612
Uh, a while.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.655
You know,
Brad needed a meeting,

06:45.696 --> 06:47.907
so we hit the 6:30
at the church.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.076
Brad needed a meeting?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.411
Uh, yeah, no,
I mean, I guess

06:51.452 --> 06:52.620
we-we both did.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.330
You know,
between the house stuff

06:54.372 --> 06:56.582
and BornFree,
it's kind of been a lot.

06:56.624 --> 07:00.753
Okay, well, tell me before
it gets to be too much, okay?

07:00.795 --> 07:04.006
Can't handle you falling
off the wagon right now.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.092
Right. Yeah.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.302
I saw my dad yesterday.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.763
He might lose the house.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.891
-Damn, it's that bad?
-Yeah.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.144
Cami's baby cleaned out
his savings.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.229
He never received
his SBA loan.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.689
Cory's gonna move back home

07:19.730 --> 07:21.232
to help
with the mortgage payments,

07:21.274 --> 07:23.317
but probably won't be enough.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.240
I told him
that I would talk to you

07:29.282 --> 07:32.952
about us maybe taking over
my old bedroom.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.538
What? No.
No, no, no, absolutely not.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.747
Okay, look, I know
it's not ideal,

07:36.789 --> 07:38.749
but we're gonna need
someplace to live.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.960
Plus, the extra couple hundred
we could pitch in each month,

07:41.002 --> 07:42.712
it would really make
a difference for Dad.

07:42.753 --> 07:46.299
And free child care.
Two hot meals a day.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.508
Yeah, you get that
in prison too.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.843
Do we have a choice, Lip?

07:48.885 --> 07:50.845
You got fired.
We have bills.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.972
You know, you can't get
a mortgage without a job,

07:53.014 --> 07:54.807
and either way,
we can't afford a house now.

07:54.849 --> 07:58.186
So then we move back
into the RV, right?

07:58.728 --> 08:01.397
Next to your family and a gang
of homicidal Milkoviches?

08:01.439 --> 08:04.275
At least there,
we can have loud sex.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.318
Right?

08:05.359 --> 08:07.528
You know, we can walk around
in our underwear.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.072
A-at Bob's, I feel like
I need to take a shower

08:10.114 --> 08:13.284
and put on a tie every time
I want a cup of coffee.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.872
Okay, uh, well, if you have
any helpful suggestions

08:17.914 --> 08:21.209
about where we're gonna live,
I'm all ears.

08:22.585 --> 08:23.878
I'll figure it out.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.630
No, what the fuck
does that mean, Lip,

08:25.671 --> 08:26.964
you'll  figure it out?

08:27.006 --> 08:30.301
'Cause I thought
that we were a  we  now.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.886
And we are.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.056
Okay.
[scoffs]

08:35.097 --> 08:36.891
Well...

08:36.933 --> 08:40.186
keep me posted
on what we come up with.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.273
jaunty music

08:48.694 --> 08:51.197
Oh, the prodigal thief returns.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.240
Don't give me shit.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.574
I was doing a favor
for your brother.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.118
Yeah?
How'd your expedition go?

08:56.160 --> 08:58.037
[Carl] What expedition?

08:58.913 --> 09:00.414
Ian got his period
this morning,

09:00.456 --> 09:01.582
sent me out for doughnuts.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.792
Got to Sweet Susan's

09:02.833 --> 09:04.460
before they sold out
of chocolate cream.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.212
[Carl] I love Sweet Susan's.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.505
[Mickey]
Fucking five-oh favorite.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.589
Is it laundry day or something?

09:08.631 --> 09:09.549
Day off.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.633
[Liam] What's on deck?

09:10.675 --> 09:11.926
[Carl] Furniture store.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.427
Gonna blow
my sweet cop paycheck

09:13.469 --> 09:14.804
on a brand-new crib.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.056
-You moving out?
-[Carl] Moving down.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.099
Taking over the basement.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.559
None of you fuckers
are allowed down there.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.478
-[door closes]
-Good morning, Gallagher youth.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.688
Fuck off, Frank.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.398
[Frank] Walked past
the Milkovich house.

09:25.439 --> 09:29.569
Guess what I saw
in the front yard.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.404
Absolutely nothing!

09:31.445 --> 09:35.157
Not a racist redneck
or human turd in sight.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.702
Even the tent city's quiet.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.413
Terry's drive-by shooting's
gonna be the best thing

09:40.454 --> 09:42.540
to ever happen
to the South Side.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.584
[Ian] Anybody have any leads
on who shot him?

09:44.625 --> 09:46.961
-Whoever did deserves a medal.
-Eh, I doubt we're looking.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.422
It's not like Chicago PD's
gonna waste taxpayer dollars

09:49.463 --> 09:52.717
on some piece of shit
like Terry Milkovich.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.010
No offense, Mick.

09:54.051 --> 09:54.760
None taken.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.554
Oh, asshole's coming home
today.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.597
[Ian] What, already?

09:57.638 --> 09:59.682
Shouldn't he be going to rehab?

09:59.724 --> 10:02.602
No such thing as rehab
for the poor.

10:02.643 --> 10:05.021
They just dig out the bullet,
staple you shut,

10:05.062 --> 10:07.231
and kick you in the nuts
on the way out.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.983
[Ian] They sending him home
with a nurse or something,

10:09.025 --> 10:10.067
at least?

10:10.109 --> 10:11.027
I don't think so.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.111
Sandy's been dealing
with the hospital.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.530
I was hoping
the fucker'd just die.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.574
Maybe Sandy's husband
could help.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.326
Royal?
No fucking way.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.452
That guy's a douchebag.

10:19.493 --> 10:22.788
Hmm. Is that where she's
been staying, with Royal?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.749
Fuck should I know?
Ask yourself.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.375
Yeah, I would
if she called me back.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.835
I've left her, like,
30 messages.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.545
That is 29 times too many.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.922
Tell her to grow some ovaries
and come talk to me.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.507
Don't get me involved
in your dyke drama.

10:33.549 --> 10:34.967
Deal with your own mess.

10:35.009 --> 10:35.551
My mess?

10:35.593 --> 10:36.677
She's the one who's married...

10:36.719 --> 10:37.762
to a dude!

10:37.803 --> 10:39.889
[Frank laughs]

10:39.930 --> 10:43.309
Should anyone need me...
I'll be upstairs.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.311
[Debbie]
Nobody needs you, Frank.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.773
Hey, Debs, uh,
think we could finish up

10:48.814 --> 10:49.857
the ambulance today?

10:49.899 --> 10:51.025
Yeah, sure,
I'm finally getting

10:51.067 --> 10:52.360
my ankle monitor off
this morning,

10:52.401 --> 10:53.861
but, uh, in a few hours,
I should have

10:53.903 --> 10:55.196
a little bit of time.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.280
That work?

10:56.322 --> 10:58.449
Can I get a ride
to school, Debs?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.450
Sure, Liam.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.701
Anybody else?
Do you need anything?

11:00.743 --> 11:02.244
A massage?
Huh?

11:02.286 --> 11:03.412
Wouldn't say no.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.622
Fuck off, Mickey.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.748
[Mickey chuckles]

11:08.250 --> 11:09.460
Kev!

11:09.502 --> 11:10.628
Where are the brownie pans?

11:10.670 --> 11:13.214
Okay, here we go.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.173
Two beautiful girls

11:14.215 --> 11:15.466
ready to show their mommy off
at school.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.302
Oh, I am so excited
to be class parent.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.887
I need a break from the adults.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.889
Hey, how many voters
did you register yesterday?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.182
Three in five hours.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.143
So many good Black folks
died from the virus

11:26.185 --> 11:26.977
or moving away.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.688
I'm starting to think
we should give up

11:28.729 --> 11:31.023
and leave the South Side
to the gentrifiers.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.650
Hey, those gentrifiers
buy weed,

11:32.692 --> 11:34.735
the expensive stuff
with the weird names.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.113
I had some hipster kid come in
for an edible yesterday.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.031
He said that we're
the up-and-coming...

11:39.073 --> 11:41.617
neighborhood,
said we're the next Pilsen.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.618
Pilsen?

11:42.660 --> 11:43.911
The place where they do
art walks?

11:43.953 --> 11:45.996
Yeah,
and the fancy food trucks.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.082
The other kids are gonna be
so jealous of you.

11:48.124 --> 11:52.503
You guys have the sexiest mama
on the South Side.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.130
A-and the smartest.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.716
[Veronica]
Damn right, the smartest.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.428
Girls, in 2021, we are ignoring
the male gaze

12:00.469 --> 12:02.138
and focusing on our minds.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.098
It's where the energy
needs to go.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.975
Well, this male gaze
is gonna focus

12:06.016 --> 12:08.477
on you walking out that door.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.687
[Kev chuckles]

12:09.729 --> 12:12.189
[Veronica laughs]

12:12.231 --> 12:15.401
[shower running]

12:16.902 --> 12:18.654
Frank, can I ask you something?

12:18.696 --> 12:20.406
[Frank grunts]

12:20.448 --> 12:21.949
Do you believe in God?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.325
I mean, the evidence is thin,

12:23.367 --> 12:24.702
but I think God is real...

12:24.744 --> 12:25.786
[Frank grunts]

12:25.828 --> 12:28.289
...which means so is Hell.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.790
[Frank groans]

12:29.832 --> 12:32.710
Say you did something bad
by accident.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.963
Do you still go down there
and get tortured by demons?

12:37.798 --> 12:39.925
Little hard to masturbate
when you keep asking me

12:39.967 --> 12:42.595
questions about Catholicism,
kid.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.807
It's fine.
I give up anyway.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.185
Son, Hell, much like prisons,

12:49.226 --> 12:51.479
is just a way
to frighten people

12:51.520 --> 12:52.938
into submission.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.816
You can buy a pardon
from the Catholic Church,

12:55.858 --> 12:57.693
be absolved of your sins,

12:57.735 --> 12:59.528
just like you can buy a judge.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.781
It's the oldest scam
in the book.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.073
How much is a pardon?

13:03.115 --> 13:04.950
More than you'll ever have.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.244
If you're worried
about something, go confess.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.288
Light some candles,
say some Hail Marys,

13:09.330 --> 13:12.124
and voilÃ , you're back
on God's good side,

13:12.166 --> 13:15.628
unless, of course,
you did something really bad.

13:15.669 --> 13:16.796
Then you'll be tormented

13:16.837 --> 13:19.507
in the deepest depths of Hell
for eternity.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.427
Last day at sex offender's
corner, Franny.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.470
Isn't that great?

13:24.512 --> 13:26.472
Tomorrow I can walk you
all the way to school.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.682
Mommy, where's Sandy?

13:29.642 --> 13:32.436
She's off lying somewhere
about being single.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.022
I want Sandy.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.985
-[cell phone clicks]
-Okay, say it again, sweetie.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.029
Sandy needs to know
just how much you miss her.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.824
Say, "Where's Sandy?
I want Sandy."

13:44.865 --> 13:46.742
[softly] I want Sandy.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.202
Louder.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.329
[softly] I want Sandy.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.914
Louder, like you mean it.

13:51.956 --> 13:52.915
[Franny crying]

13:52.957 --> 13:54.959
Thanks for nothing, Franny!

13:55.000 --> 13:57.086
-[scoffs]
-[door slams]

13:57.127 --> 13:59.839
rock music

14:11.725 --> 14:15.521
[cylinder clicking]

14:15.563 --> 14:16.897
[Zofia] This is stupid.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.024
-You volunteer, then.
-Well, who put you in charge?

14:19.066 --> 14:20.401
The Grand fucking Wizard,
that's who.

14:20.442 --> 14:21.569
[Mickey] Yo!

14:21.610 --> 14:22.736
What are you idiots doing?

14:22.778 --> 14:24.697
Joey here has a dumb idea.

14:24.738 --> 14:25.698
-Yeah.
-Shut up!

14:25.739 --> 14:26.782
Can't decide
who's gonna take care

14:26.824 --> 14:28.576
of Uncle Terry
when he gets back.

14:28.617 --> 14:29.785
Take care?

14:29.827 --> 14:31.579
Feed him, empty his shit bag,
and wash his balls.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.496
Fuck, man.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.831
Jeez, with the fucking imagery.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.291
So we're playing
Russian roulette.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.750
Four of us,
three bullets in the gun.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.836
Whoever doesn't get shot
takes care of the cripple.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.920
[cylinder clicking]

14:39.962 --> 14:41.547
Seems like a great plan.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.715
[Sammy]
I shouldn't have to play.

14:42.756 --> 14:43.799
I'm the one servicing
that old bag

14:43.841 --> 14:45.759
twice a week
so we can keep our house.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.011
Wait, you're fucking McCurdy?

14:47.052 --> 14:48.470
Yeah, he should get a pass.

14:48.512 --> 14:49.805
Screw it.
I'm going first.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.849
I'd rather die
than wash Terry's balls.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.017
[Mickey]
All right, hold on.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.895
Hold on. Hold o--
Put that down.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.354
Look, I'm not gonna lie:
as fun as it would be

14:57.396 --> 14:59.148
to watch you all blow
your fucking brains out,

14:59.189 --> 15:01.025
I actually happen to like
one or two of you.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.986
So, Alek, you're his favorite.
You're doing it.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.988
Yeah, he's right.
You're his favorite.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.656
But that-that's only
because I let him

15:07.698 --> 15:09.909
practice  ringen  on me
as a kid.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.285
What's  ringen?

15:11.327 --> 15:13.245
German wrestling,
very homo-sexy.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.955
And my shoulder's
still messed up.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.749
Well, you got off easy,
'cause he's been actually

15:16.790 --> 15:18.751
trying to kill my ass
last couple years.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.462
So ring, ring,
duty fucking calls.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.506
jaunty music

15:24.548 --> 15:25.633
Let's get it started

15:25.674 --> 15:27.092
Just leave
your problems home

15:27.134 --> 15:28.719
Strictly good vibes
over here

15:28.761 --> 15:29.887
Let's get it started

15:29.929 --> 15:31.138
Everybody just say it
with me

15:31.180 --> 15:33.057
One time
real loud and clear

15:33.098 --> 15:34.934
Let's get it started

15:37.227 --> 15:39.063
Let's get it started

15:41.273 --> 15:42.942
Let's get it started

15:45.861 --> 15:47.613
Let's get it started

15:47.655 --> 15:48.864
Excellent.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.577
[bell chimes]

15:53.619 --> 15:55.412
Ah, Mrs. G.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.666
Light brain teaser with
your morning coffee, I see.

15:58.707 --> 15:59.416
Good choice.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.127
Gotta exercise
those mental muscles.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.755
What do you want, Frank?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.757
I'm here to pick up my stuff.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.425
What stuff?

16:09.677 --> 16:11.220
I...

16:11.261 --> 16:13.597
I paid for five ounces
in advance.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.182
You wrote it down somewhere,

16:15.224 --> 16:17.768
on a Post-it note,
back of a napkin--

16:17.810 --> 16:20.145
No need to write it down.
Mind's a steel trap.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.273
We're all settled up.
I don't owe you anything.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.067
Okay, now, I'm not just
a college kid

16:25.109 --> 16:27.611
buying a doobie
with his daddy's money.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.238
My sativa, please.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.656
[Gor] Everything okay out here?

16:30.698 --> 16:32.032
[Frank]
Yes. No!

16:32.074 --> 16:35.452
No, your mom's trying to pull
a fast one on me.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.705
You know, there was a time
on the South Side

16:37.746 --> 16:39.331
when we had honor, a code.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.875
Maybe it was before
you people moved in.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.002
What is he talking about?

16:43.043 --> 16:44.586
No idea. Frank?

16:44.628 --> 16:46.213
You gonna leave or not?

16:46.255 --> 16:48.716
No!
Absolutely not--

16:48.757 --> 16:49.717
[body thuds]

16:52.302 --> 16:53.846
Why don't you guys
move back here?

16:53.887 --> 16:55.222
Oh, Tami doesn't want to,

16:55.264 --> 16:57.182
said she'd rather have Fred
see white nationalists

16:57.224 --> 17:00.019
on the TV at Bob's
than in the yard next door,

17:00.060 --> 17:02.104
and, you know,
I can't say I blame her.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.689
The neighborhood's on the up,

17:03.731 --> 17:05.357
but block keeps getting
shittier.

17:05.399 --> 17:06.608
Pop?

17:07.109 --> 17:10.404
Maybe we should just cut
our losses, move in with Bob.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.281
We can be
the fucked-up Brady Bunch.

17:12.322 --> 17:13.949
No, no, no,
don't give up yet, man.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.117
All right?

17:15.159 --> 17:16.785
Look, we sell the stuff
from BornFree.

17:16.827 --> 17:17.995
That'll carry us for a while.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.955
We'll put the parts
and the tools downstairs.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.041
Now, our only real problem
are the bikes.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.793
Can't use my garage.
It's full of baby crap.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.086
Yeah,
we couldn't use that anyway.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.921
You know, it's the first place
the cops would look.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.298
The cops?

17:29.339 --> 17:30.924
Yeah, they might come
poking around.

17:30.966 --> 17:33.010
[scoffs]
Guess you've done this before.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.219
Yeah, it's
in the Gallagher playbook.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.387
You get it at birth.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.473
Your brother's not gonna be
a problem, the cop?

17:37.514 --> 17:40.225
No, Carl wouldn't turn
on family.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.895
[Brad] Okay.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.938
And Steely Susan.
There you go.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.065
Thank you very much.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.067
Enjoy responsibly.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.195
I mean, with rehab, he might
move his arms again one day.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.530
-Who knows? He could even walk.
-[Ian] I don't get it.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.699
What's so great
about your dad walking again?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.242
Less of a burden on the family.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.660
What are you guys
talking about?

17:58.702 --> 18:00.037
Terry's coming home today.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.163
[Kev] So soon?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.624
Don't worry.
He's a fucking vegetable.

18:03.665 --> 18:07.503
That's the most I've heard you
talk about your dad in...ever.

18:07.544 --> 18:08.462
Why do you care?

18:08.504 --> 18:10.214
Why save a man just to dump him
on his family?

18:10.255 --> 18:13.509
Like, do the world a favor.
Pull the fucking plug already.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.260
Jesus, Mick.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.179
Being long-term sick
is worse than death.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.764
You fix that
by improving services,

18:18.806 --> 18:20.307
not by killing people.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.725
I don't wanna pay
for Terry's wet nurse

18:21.767 --> 18:23.018
with my tax money.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.937
You pay taxes on this weed?

18:24.978 --> 18:26.522
Sometimes, a little bit.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.231
Uh-huh.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.357
It's a lot of product, Kev.

18:28.398 --> 18:30.359
Yeah, he almost shat himself
on the way here.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.986
I'll feel better once
we finish up the ambulance.

18:33.028 --> 18:33.987
We're bulletproofing it

18:34.029 --> 18:35.948
and adding a safe
for all this cash.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.282
Smart,
weed's selling faster

18:37.324 --> 18:40.119
than toilet paper
during quarantine.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.955
All right, nice doing business
with you, Chapo.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.123
Come on, sugar tits.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.707
We got an ambulance
to pimp out.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.752
rock music

19:05.310 --> 19:08.272
Hey, Timmy.
It's me, Liam, from next door.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.606
I know who you are.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.692
Um, I heard
about your Uncle Terry.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.318
Not my uncle, my dad.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.156
Well, guess he's actually
my uncle and my dad.

19:17.197 --> 19:18.407
I'm really sorry, man.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.867
Why do you give a shit?

19:19.908 --> 19:21.285
It's just sad that--

19:21.326 --> 19:22.828
Only time a man
apologizes for something

19:22.870 --> 19:24.872
is if he did it
or knows who did.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.540
You know who it was?

19:27.624 --> 19:28.292
Do you?

19:28.333 --> 19:29.501
No!
I was just trying to--

19:29.543 --> 19:30.961
[Timmy] When we find
the bastard that shot

19:31.003 --> 19:33.172
Pappy Terry,
he'll be more than paralyzed.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.423
We'll cut him up,
bleed him out,

19:34.464 --> 19:37.384
grind him up,
and feed him to our dogs.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.848
[school bell rings]

19:42.890 --> 19:45.934
[Muzak playing]

19:49.438 --> 19:51.273
-[employee] Sir--
-[customer] It says right here.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.691
-Right here!
-[employee] Uh, sir?

19:52.733 --> 19:54.193
[over P.A. system]
Someone from bathrooms

19:54.234 --> 19:56.195
to the living room section,
please.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.739
[customer] It says right here
on the receipt,

19:58.780 --> 20:00.240
free returns for 90 days.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.784
[employee] Uh, your purchase
was made 123 days ago.

20:02.826 --> 20:03.994
No, it wasn't!

20:04.036 --> 20:05.829
Sir, I can tell you used
a ballpoint pen

20:05.871 --> 20:07.039
to change the three to a four.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.665
[customer] You calling me
a fucking liar now?

20:08.707 --> 20:10.000
You know what?
I wanna speak to your manager.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.376
-Where is he?
-[Carl] Hey, is there

20:11.418 --> 20:12.419
a problem over here?

20:12.461 --> 20:13.587
'Cause it looks like
from over there,

20:13.629 --> 20:16.089
you're harassing this kind
and capable lady manager

20:16.131 --> 20:18.717
who's just trying to help
you out with your return.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.430
I might've lost my temper.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.558
Why don't you take a walk
and come back when you find it?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.395
-Yes, of course.
-[soft scoff]

20:30.437 --> 20:32.064
Thank you, Officer.

20:33.941 --> 20:34.983
Sorry.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.443
[employee] Mm.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.528
Real asshole.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.697
-Not even the worst one today.
-[both chuckle]

20:40.739 --> 20:43.325
People are so on edge
since the corona.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.119
Thank you for rescuing me,
um...

20:46.161 --> 20:47.037
Carl.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.664
Tish.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.540
You kind of came
out of nowhere, Carl.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.252
Oh, no, I just came
from the recliner section.

20:53.293 --> 20:56.255
Right.
Well, I can help you.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.507
Are you looking
for anything in particular?

20:58.548 --> 21:01.802
I'm looking for something
comfortable but not too stuffy.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.972
I got just the thing.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.432
Storage arm,
five-speed massage.

21:07.474 --> 21:08.475
How much is it?

21:08.517 --> 21:09.810
[Tish] Too much.
[laughs]

21:09.851 --> 21:13.188
But I'd love to use
my employee discount for you.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.648
It's 20 percent.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.233
I owe you.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.944
Yeah, I guess you do
kind of owe me.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.073
I could throw in
my phone number too

21:23.115 --> 21:24.908
if you want it.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.077
All right, cool.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.245
Great.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.329
[Tish laughs]

21:29.371 --> 21:31.707
[Veronica]
Okay, let's do books!

21:31.748 --> 21:35.502
How many books
can you count in the class?

21:35.544 --> 21:37.587
-One, good.
-[children] One, two...

21:37.629 --> 21:39.131
-[Veronica] Two.
-[children] ...three...

21:39.172 --> 21:40.173
[Veronica] Uh-huh.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.550
[children] ...four!

21:41.591 --> 21:42.884
[Veronica] Four!
Okay.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.469
So four.
Is that it?

21:44.511 --> 21:45.595
I'll be damned.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.015
There's only four books
in this whole room?

21:48.056 --> 21:50.017
All right,
add it to the table.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.518
[Mrs. Sugar]
Good morning, class.

21:51.560 --> 21:55.522
[children]
Good morning, Mrs. Sugar!

21:55.564 --> 21:56.898
It's time to play
our special game,

21:56.940 --> 21:59.943
and it's your class' turn
to assign roles this week.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.278
[children] Yay!

22:01.320 --> 22:02.946
[Veronica]
Yay! Ooh, yay!

22:02.988 --> 22:04.448
What game are we playing?

22:04.489 --> 22:05.741
It's our weekly
active shooter drill

22:05.782 --> 22:09.536
or, as we like to call it,
"Hide from the bang-bangs."

22:09.578 --> 22:11.288
All right, who wants
to be the shooter?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.665
[children]
Me! Me! Me!

22:13.707 --> 22:15.876
I love the initiative,
but remember, statistically,

22:15.917 --> 22:17.753
most mass shooters are...

22:17.794 --> 22:18.837
white boys.

22:18.879 --> 22:19.755
Yes!

22:19.796 --> 22:21.631
[Mrs. Sugar] Sorry, class.
Accuracy is important.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.092
Now, Chris, come on.
Suit up.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.427
Here, get this.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.887
[Veronica] This can't be real.

22:26.928 --> 22:28.013
[Mrs. Sugar] Spin it.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.890
All right, off you go.

22:29.931 --> 22:30.766
Get in position.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.851
Okay, who wants to be
"in the bathroom"

22:32.893 --> 22:33.852
or "in the hallway"?

22:33.894 --> 22:35.645
[Amy and Gemma]
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

22:35.687 --> 22:39.024
[Mrs. Cardenas] Okay, you two,
head to the bathroom.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.400
Girls, wait for Mama.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.194
Y'all play this game
every week?

22:42.235 --> 22:44.404
[Amy] Yes, Mommy.
We always win.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.866
I don't see how there can be
any winners in this game.

22:49.743 --> 22:52.537
Okay, ready.
Here we go.

22:53.789 --> 22:54.998
[gunshot]

22:55.040 --> 22:56.500
[Gemma] Mama, hurry, hurry!

22:56.541 --> 22:59.294
I'm coming!
Mama's coming!

22:59.836 --> 23:02.672
Whoo, that kid's gonna need
a hell of a therapist!

23:02.714 --> 23:05.884
heavy rock music

23:11.598 --> 23:13.600
-Clear.
-Clear!

23:14.518 --> 23:16.061
Oh, my goodness.
What do I do?

23:16.103 --> 23:18.522
[Amy and Gemma] Door!

23:21.149 --> 23:22.567
Shields.

23:22.609 --> 23:25.904
Honey, the bullets
will go right through these.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.325
These are where
my brownie pans went?

23:30.367 --> 23:31.743
We made shields.

23:31.785 --> 23:34.413
[sighs]
This is messed up.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.498
I keep you safe, Mommy.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.838
[drill whirring]

23:42.879 --> 23:44.965
And do you wanna know
the worst part of all of this?

23:45.006 --> 23:46.341
Oh, God, not again.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.718
I don't know how much longer
I can take this, Debs.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.429
Do you wanna give me
a safe space to vent

23:50.470 --> 23:51.555
about my relationship,

23:51.596 --> 23:54.224
or do you wanna pay
my regular welding rate?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.267
Fine.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.351
Go ahead.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.729
I mean,
I opened up my life to Sandy:

23:59.771 --> 24:02.482
my daughter, my family,
you guys...

24:02.524 --> 24:03.984
Well, technically,
she's my cousin,

24:04.025 --> 24:04.901
and I fucked her first.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.529
...assuming that she
was doing the same thing,

24:07.571 --> 24:09.739
but she shut me out,
so now I'm sitting here,

24:09.781 --> 24:11.908
butt naked, vulnerable,
and heartbroken

24:11.950 --> 24:14.411
while she's building up
a goddamn border wall

24:14.453 --> 24:15.871
between the two of us.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.664
Hey, guys.
Uh, Mick, talk to you

24:17.706 --> 24:18.915
-for a minute?
-Yes, please.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.168
[Debbie] I just don't know
why she would do that to me

24:21.209 --> 24:22.419
after everything
that we've been through.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.504
All right, so I can't find
a place to stash the bikes.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.214
I put some of the parts
in my garage,

24:26.256 --> 24:27.799
but the basement's out.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.551
Look, we gotta get the bikes
off the truck

24:29.593 --> 24:32.262
and figure out a way to sell
them--I need the money.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.347
All right, I might have
a spot for you,

24:34.389 --> 24:35.515
but I'ma need a finder's fee.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.100
On top of your cut
from last night?

24:37.142 --> 24:38.977
Gotta make that bread.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.395
Fine, two percent.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.522
[laughs]
Ten.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.232
-Five.
-Deal.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.233
I'll finish up the ambulance.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.443
We'll go stash the bikes,
all right?

24:46.485 --> 24:47.652
Okay.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.241
[Frank] That hurts.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.868
Can I get something
for the pain?

24:54.910 --> 24:58.663
[nurse] No, we need you lucid
to rule out a concussion.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.373
Know how you got here?

25:00.415 --> 25:02.542
Not on my own free will.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.504
A woman found you
unconscious and bleeding

25:05.545 --> 25:07.631
behind a dumpster,

25:07.672 --> 25:09.382
called 911.

25:09.424 --> 25:12.802
You're lucky.
Head injuries can be serious.

25:12.844 --> 25:16.223
Is this fine citizen gonna pay
for the ambulance too,

25:16.264 --> 25:18.683
or what's this
gonna set me back?

25:21.061 --> 25:24.481
So...how did this happen?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.900
I hit my head.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.652
On what?

25:28.693 --> 25:31.988
On a...a pole.

25:32.030 --> 25:35.867
It was, like, hanging down
from the side of a building.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.329
What's your name again?

25:39.371 --> 25:41.373
-Frank.
-Frank what?

25:43.041 --> 25:45.335
G-Gallagher.

25:48.296 --> 25:51.508
Can you remember
three words for me?

25:51.550 --> 25:54.344
Blue, handlebar, pedestrian.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.054
Pedestrian, like your question.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.556
Blue, like my balls.

25:57.597 --> 25:58.807
Handlebar.
I got it.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.016
What year is it, Frank?

26:00.058 --> 26:04.062
About ten years after I walked
into this fucking ER.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.355
Who's the president?

26:05.397 --> 26:06.481
Vladimir Putin.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.400
Oh, you mean
of the United States?

26:08.441 --> 26:09.693
Um...

26:09.734 --> 26:12.112
same...same answer.

26:14.489 --> 26:17.284
What words did I ask you
to remember?

26:20.036 --> 26:22.747
I'm not-I'm not playing
this game anymore.

26:22.789 --> 26:23.832
-Are you--
-Gonna need...

26:23.873 --> 26:26.251
gonna need to run
some more tests.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.337
Strap in.
It's gonna take a while.

26:29.379 --> 26:33.133
[ambulance siren
wails in background]

26:35.385 --> 26:36.344
[Mickey] Let's move it.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.554
We're late
for our cash pickups.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.472
Better late than dead.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.277
[Sandy] Zofia! Alek!
We're here!

26:57.782 --> 26:59.117
Come on, help me
get him up.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.162
-[chair lift whirring]
-[whispers] Oh, fuck.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.835
[softly ]Fuck.

27:11.171 --> 27:14.299
[chair lift whirring]

27:17.135 --> 27:19.596
-All right.
-Take this shit off my face.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.805
[indistinct muttering,
swearing]

27:20.847 --> 27:22.432
Get this off my face.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.018
[Milkoviches shouting
indistinctly]

27:25.060 --> 27:26.728
I got it!

27:26.770 --> 27:28.855
[Alek] Come on, bitch, lift
the fucking--just lift it.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.440
[Sammy] I got it, okay?

27:30.482 --> 27:31.816
Should we help?

27:31.858 --> 27:34.110
[Zofia] Can you actually
do something?

27:34.152 --> 27:35.695
No.

27:35.737 --> 27:36.863
[arguing continues]

27:36.905 --> 27:38.365
[Sandy] Come on, you're pulling
on my fucking--

27:38.406 --> 27:39.908
-[Sammy] Agh!
-[Sandy] I need

27:39.949 --> 27:41.242
-a fucking break.
-[Zofia] Ow! Fuck.

27:41.284 --> 27:43.078
[Alek] Oh, shit.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.580
[Sandy] We need to get him up
to the fucking house.

27:45.622 --> 27:46.873
[Alek] Hey, should we, uh...
build a ramp?

27:46.915 --> 27:48.541
[Sandy] A ramp, yeah.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.501
We need to get...

27:49.542 --> 27:50.877
[Milkoviches arguing]

27:50.919 --> 27:53.755
[wheelchair clattering]

27:53.797 --> 27:54.714
Go get a ramp.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.549
We need to get him
in the house.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.552
Okay?

28:01.471 --> 28:03.723
Yeah, it's...

28:03.765 --> 28:06.559
weird seeing the old cripple
in pain like that.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.019
[Sammy] Here we go.
Here we go!

28:08.061 --> 28:09.437
I could walk over there
right now

28:09.479 --> 28:11.815
and scoop his eyeball out
with a spoon.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.484
Couldn't do a damn thing
about it.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.944
You could do that.

28:15.985 --> 28:18.655
Piss on him,
let him air-dry,

28:18.697 --> 28:21.241
use his mouth
for a fucking ashtray.

28:21.282 --> 28:22.492
[Alek] It's not helping.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.661
We gotta get the ramp
on the stairs.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.372
What, you wouldn't feel
the same way if it was Frank?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.460
I don't think
I'd wish that on Frank...

28:32.502 --> 28:33.712
[Zofia]
Come on, you guys.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.922
...or anybody, really.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.633
Well, Frank's not
a homophobic psychopath

28:38.675 --> 28:40.969
who tortured you every day
for years.

28:41.010 --> 28:43.221
No, he's just an
emotionally abusive alcoholic

28:43.263 --> 28:46.307
who stole my money for drugs,
broke my nose,

28:46.349 --> 28:48.226
tried to profit off my mania.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.064
I guess we both had shit dads.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.192
Let's get the fuck out of here.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.777
Lip, you comin'?

28:57.819 --> 28:59.279
Yep.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.115
Hi.

29:02.157 --> 29:02.991
Hey.

29:03.032 --> 29:04.784
How come you haven't returned
my texts?

29:04.826 --> 29:06.703
Uh, I've been a little busy.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.913
-[whispers] Fuck.
-[groans] Ugh...

29:08.955 --> 29:10.832
Who's Royal?
How long have you been married?

29:10.874 --> 29:12.333
Are you getting a divorce?

29:12.375 --> 29:14.586
Shut the fuck up,

29:14.627 --> 29:16.337
you stinking bitches.

29:16.379 --> 29:18.047
Jesus Christ.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.800
How the fuck did I end up
with a family full of faggots?

29:20.842 --> 29:22.844
-[scoffs]
-Your mama liked it up the ass.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.304
-That's how.
-Fuck you, dyke.

29:24.345 --> 29:27.474
Oh, shut up, or I'll feed you
your colostomy bag.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.058
[sighs]

29:29.100 --> 29:30.810
I-I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Royal,

29:30.852 --> 29:32.562
but I'm-I'm handling it.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.688
Handling it how?

29:33.730 --> 29:35.815
Uh, I've got it under control.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.317
That's it?
That's...

29:37.358 --> 29:38.985
all you're gonna give me?

29:39.027 --> 29:40.904
Uh...[scoffs]
Debbie, like, I can--

29:40.945 --> 29:42.989
No, honestly, fuck that.
I'm done.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.700
Have a good life
with your fucking husband.

29:45.742 --> 29:46.785
[Alek] Hey!

29:46.826 --> 29:48.369
[laughing] Hey, ah.

29:48.411 --> 29:50.413
We can cut the legs off this,

29:50.455 --> 29:51.664
use it as a ramp.

29:51.706 --> 29:53.666
Then where do we cut
the drugs, huh,

29:53.708 --> 29:55.043
and clean the guns?

29:55.084 --> 29:56.252
-Fucking eat?
-Fuck!

29:56.294 --> 29:58.004
-Use your stupid brain, idiot.
-Oh, fuck you, Terry.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.089
Let's fucking leave him
out here.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.008
You coming?
Come on, Zofia.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.344
Yeah, works for me.

30:06.763 --> 30:07.931
God damn it.

30:07.972 --> 30:08.890
[door slams]

30:08.932 --> 30:10.183
I understand your concern.

30:10.225 --> 30:12.143
This country is a hotbed
of mass shooters.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.603
Why are we training them
for free?

30:13.645 --> 30:14.771
We're not;
we're teaching

30:14.813 --> 30:16.189
our most vulnerable
how to think quickly,

30:16.231 --> 30:18.650
act defensively
in a high-stress situation.

30:18.691 --> 30:19.901
Any kid with half a brain

30:19.943 --> 30:21.110
can learn
from one of those drills

30:21.152 --> 30:22.946
how to go about
shooting up a school.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.405
Twenty bucks says
that Chris kid

30:24.447 --> 30:25.448
is already stockpiling.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.950
Oh, Chris' family are Quaker.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.284
They don't believe in guns.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.537
I don't feel comfortable
subjecting my girls

30:30.578 --> 30:31.579
to this kind of trauma.

30:31.621 --> 30:32.831
They are Black girls
in America.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.749
At least at school,
they should be safe.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.292
Well, I'm sorry,
we used our PE money

30:36.334 --> 30:38.586
to give away hot lunches
during the pandemic.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.296
Can't afford gym class,

30:40.338 --> 30:41.673
so pretending to run scared
down the hallway

30:41.714 --> 30:42.924
from a crazed shooter's
the only cardio

30:42.966 --> 30:44.050
these kids are gonna get
all week.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.760
It's like what
Mrs. Obama said, right?

30:45.802 --> 30:46.928
Kids gotta move.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.471
Don't think
that's what she meant.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.639
Well, I'm sorry.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.016
-Appreciate you coming in.
-[line rings]

30:52.058 --> 30:55.019

30:57.021 --> 30:58.940
[cell phone chimes]

31:22.005 --> 31:23.882
-[knock at door]
-Yo.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.849
Love what you've done
with the place.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.851
Thanks.
Want a beer?

31:34.893 --> 31:36.561
Eh, no, thanks.

31:36.603 --> 31:37.937
Can I talk to you
about something?

31:37.979 --> 31:38.980
Yeah.
What's up?

31:39.022 --> 31:39.981
I didn't mean to do it,

31:40.023 --> 31:42.108
but I did,
and now I can't sleep,

31:42.150 --> 31:44.652
and I keep almost telling
the wrong people about it,

31:44.694 --> 31:45.695
dangerous people.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.030
Okay.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.407
[sighs]
Terry, from next door?

31:49.449 --> 31:51.951
That was my bullet,
from the gun you gave me.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.161
No way!

31:53.202 --> 31:55.705
You shot that fucking racist?

31:55.747 --> 31:56.873
Outstanding.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.708
It doesn't feel outstanding.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.668
Feels like I have to pay
for it somehow,

32:00.710 --> 32:01.753
rend my own flesh.

32:01.794 --> 32:03.963
Oh, rend your what?

32:04.005 --> 32:05.715
Penance.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.635
Look, young gun.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.136
You did what none of us
could do.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.763
You saw a problem on the block

32:11.804 --> 32:14.390
and took it into your own hands
to solve it.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.767
Proud of you.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.727
But you should probably
get rid of that gun

32:17.769 --> 32:19.854
and bulk up a little bit,

32:19.896 --> 32:21.105
just in case.

32:21.147 --> 32:24.108
rock music

32:28.446 --> 32:29.906
[Mickey] Yo, Kev.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.449
How much you want
to let us take over Kev-Fit

32:31.491 --> 32:32.867
for a couple days?

32:37.497 --> 32:40.833
We can stash the bikes in here
till you find some buyers.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.502
You're cool letting us
use your gym?

32:42.543 --> 32:45.463
Am I cool renting out the space
for a few friends?

32:45.505 --> 32:46.381
Yeah.

32:46.422 --> 32:49.258
Only had five paying customers
return after quarantine.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.552
Rudy tore his ass muscle,
so now it's four.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.638
Besides, I don't know
what you're gonna do with it.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.764
Stash stolen bikes.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.684
[emphatically] I don't know
what you're gonna do with it.

32:58.977 --> 32:59.936
How much?

32:59.978 --> 33:00.937
Five percent.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.146
Deal.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.023
-[whistles]
-Unbelievable.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.317
Think you'll at least
break even?

33:06.359 --> 33:09.195
Get used to it.
It's a whole new world, Lip.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.947
Every man for himself
after COVID.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.782
-[lighter flicking]
-[Mickey chuckles]

33:12.824 --> 33:15.910
[upbeat Latin music playing
over speakers]

33:18.413 --> 33:19.205
Hey.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.874
Just set your stuff down
over there.

33:21.916 --> 33:22.917
Cool.
I'm Debbie.

33:22.959 --> 33:25.169
The hot lesbian
convict handywoman.

33:25.211 --> 33:28.840
I know.
Like I said, over there.

33:28.881 --> 33:31.718
Okay.
Ex-convict, actually.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.469
I just got
my ankle bracelet off.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.221
Congratulations.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.056
That calls for a drink
on the house.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.850
Hey, Haley, why don't we, uh,
get her

33:38.891 --> 33:40.935
one of those local IPAs?

33:40.977 --> 33:42.395
Hey.
Calista.

33:42.437 --> 33:43.312
Debbie.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.440
I didn't know gay bars
were coming to the South Side.

33:45.481 --> 33:48.359
Yeah, well, uh, Logan Square's
getting too crowded, and...

33:48.401 --> 33:51.362
-Boystown's gotten too loud.
-[Debbie] Ha.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.114
You're not gonna throw
a brick through my window

33:53.156 --> 33:54.407
or weld my door shut,
are you?

33:54.449 --> 33:55.658
'Cause I heard people
around here

33:55.700 --> 33:56.701
don't love outsiders.

33:56.743 --> 33:59.120
As long as you're not
a CrossFit bro or a yogi,

33:59.162 --> 34:01.748
we welcome
all queer transplants.

34:01.789 --> 34:03.958
So what can I do for you?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.044
Right, um, I was hoping

34:06.085 --> 34:08.171
you could put this up.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.839
[laughs] Subtle.

34:09.881 --> 34:11.299
Yeah.

34:11.340 --> 34:14.135
It was either pussycat
or the rainbow flag.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.846
Good choice.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.352
Two cheeseburger combos
with fries, supersized,

34:23.394 --> 34:25.021
two frozen daiquiris,
two pies,

34:25.063 --> 34:26.355
and a scoop of ice cream.

34:26.397 --> 34:27.857
[Tish]
Wow. [chuckles]

34:27.899 --> 34:28.941
You supersized them?

34:28.983 --> 34:30.818
This cop paycheck
ain't gonna spend itself.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.154
God, it's so cool
that you're so young

34:33.196 --> 34:36.949
and you have, like,
a real-person job.

34:36.991 --> 34:38.367
[Carl laughs]

34:38.409 --> 34:40.161
[Tish] Do you get benefits?

34:40.203 --> 34:41.245
Even vision.

34:41.287 --> 34:43.039
I've got 20/20,
so it doesn't really matter,

34:43.081 --> 34:45.541
but if I ever need glasses,
I got the hookup.

34:45.583 --> 34:49.712
I wear contacts,
and they are expensive.

34:49.754 --> 34:50.963
You ever get shot?

34:51.005 --> 34:52.298
I get shot at all the time.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.592
I guess I've just
gotten lucky so far.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.052
Ever seen a dead body?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.221
Lots, but that's just
growing up on the South Side.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.806
-Mm.
-You from here?

34:59.847 --> 35:01.641
Born and raised.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.017
Why did you become a cop?

35:03.059 --> 35:05.978
I just wanted to keep an eye
on the neighborhood.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.022
Then there's
the pension, right?

35:08.064 --> 35:10.775
I feel a lot safer knowing
Officer Carl is out there,

35:10.817 --> 35:12.735
keeping the streets safe,

35:12.777 --> 35:14.028
supersizing meals.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.823
I'm just happy
to be of service, ma'am.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.372
What are we doing here?

35:24.413 --> 35:27.083
We're supposed to be making
a delivery in Bronzeville.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.292
Gonna take a shit.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.838
Since when do you come home
to take a...shit!

35:31.879 --> 35:34.507
Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.843
Hey, come on.
It's not worth it.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.052
Don't even think about it,
faggots.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.054
-[Mickey] Shut the fuck up.
-Keep your hands off me,

35:40.096 --> 35:41.973
or I'll shoot you dead.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.853
What are you staring at,
dipshit?

35:46.894 --> 35:48.980
Mick, pause.

35:49.939 --> 35:52.483
Think about it.
Is he worth it?

35:52.525 --> 35:54.318
[Terry] Your old man's
a cripple.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.863
Easiest target you'll ever get.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.826
Bet you still miss.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.202
-[trigger cocks]
-[Ian] Fuck.

36:03.244 --> 36:05.663
[Terry] Go on, do it.

36:07.081 --> 36:10.042
You'd be doing me
a favor, pussy.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.966
[breathing shakily]

36:20.678 --> 36:23.681
[whimpering]

36:39.822 --> 36:41.741
What the fuck was that?

36:41.782 --> 36:43.075
Nothing.

36:43.993 --> 36:46.078
[rock music playing
over speakers]

36:46.120 --> 36:47.830
[Letty] There he is.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.457
[Frank] Hey.

36:49.498 --> 36:52.126
Letty.
From last night.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.005
Monica?

36:56.047 --> 36:57.423
[stammering]

36:57.465 --> 37:00.468
Yes, of course.
Whoa.

37:00.509 --> 37:02.720
You're a sight for sore eyes.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.556
You will not believe
the day I have had.

37:05.598 --> 37:06.891
Drink?

37:06.933 --> 37:09.268
Barkeep!

37:09.310 --> 37:11.145
Beer for me and the lady.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.940
Put it on my tab.

37:13.981 --> 37:16.400
You don't have a tab.

37:16.442 --> 37:17.652
Well, then start one.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.612
Sure, Frank, why don't I
just wipe my ass

37:19.654 --> 37:21.322
with some Benjamins
while I'm at it?

37:21.364 --> 37:22.698
[customer]
Is your weed locally grown?

37:22.740 --> 37:24.784
[Kev] Sure is.
Organic and free-range.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.827
Let me give you a tour.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.792
Frank, honey, you okay?

37:34.418 --> 37:35.920
I bumped my head.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.129
Aw.

37:37.171 --> 37:40.341
Poor baby.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.677
Do you want me to kiss it
where it hurts?

38:11.747 --> 38:13.457
[chuckles]

38:16.043 --> 38:18.546
[R&B music playing
over speakers]

38:18.587 --> 38:20.256
Oh, wow, that looks great.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.841
-Yeah, thanks.
-Thank you.

38:21.882 --> 38:22.842
Mm-hmm.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.511
Come to our opening tonight.

38:25.553 --> 38:28.055
Bring your girlfriend
if she's free.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.224
Not really sure.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.351
If she's free?

38:32.393 --> 38:34.145
If I have a girlfriend.

38:34.186 --> 38:36.480
Do tell.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.774
God, where to start?
Okay.

38:38.816 --> 38:42.653
Uh, so I just found out
that she's fucking married...

38:42.695 --> 38:43.779
to a guy.

38:43.821 --> 38:47.325
I have no idea
how she met this guy,

38:47.366 --> 38:50.161
how long they've been together,
if she's still seeing him.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.371
I mean, it's not like
I haven't asked.

38:52.413 --> 38:53.581
All I do is ask.

38:53.622 --> 38:56.876
She just won't give me
any answers.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.044
Dude.

38:59.712 --> 39:02.548
You think she's straight
and just experimenting?

39:03.632 --> 39:05.634
Maybe love is just impossible.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.720
-Yeah, agreed.
-[chuckles]

39:08.888 --> 39:10.264
You know Haley.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.265
That's my ex...

39:11.307 --> 39:13.476
wife--
ex-wife.

39:13.517 --> 39:14.894
Tell you a secret?

39:14.935 --> 39:16.062
Yeah.

39:16.103 --> 39:19.899
I, uh...hired you
to make her jealous.

39:24.528 --> 39:25.654
You wanna give her something

39:25.696 --> 39:27.490
to make her lose
her mind about?

39:40.628 --> 39:43.923
Hey, did you hear BornFree
got broken into last--

39:43.964 --> 39:45.674
What are you doing?

39:47.676 --> 39:50.179
Rearranging some stuff.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.391
Rearranging boxes
I've never seen before

39:53.432 --> 39:56.060
with the BornFree logo on them?

39:58.938 --> 40:00.272
Brad and I broke in.

40:00.314 --> 40:02.942
What the fuck?
Why?

40:04.360 --> 40:07.530
Because I'm-I'm fucking tired,
Tami.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.240
All right?
I worked my ass off

40:09.281 --> 40:11.158
to make this home for us,
and now some hipsters

40:11.200 --> 40:12.576
are gonna move in?

40:12.618 --> 40:15.079
You know, Milton gets
to cash in on my work,

40:15.121 --> 40:17.248
and I get to go live
with Bob?

40:17.289 --> 40:19.875
A-and Brad sells BornFree
to some douchebags

40:19.917 --> 40:22.253
who think a hog
is just a large pig,

40:22.294 --> 40:24.380
and I get fired,
and I just...

40:24.422 --> 40:26.882
I just-I needed
to do something.

40:27.925 --> 40:30.219
All right?
I-I needed to fix something.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.637
And if you get caught

40:31.679 --> 40:35.057
and go to jail,
what is that gonna fix

40:35.099 --> 40:36.308
for Fred?

40:41.564 --> 40:43.149
I'm sorry.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.571
Okay?
I get it.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.489
-I fucked up.
-Yeah.

40:50.531 --> 40:52.741
[laughing] Oh, you did.

40:55.744 --> 40:58.080
I been thinking, you know,

40:58.122 --> 40:59.790
and-and I can make it right.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.959
Okay?
The-the house part.

41:03.377 --> 41:04.670
We can't go back to mine.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.089
The Milkoviches
are a ticking time bomb, right?

41:07.131 --> 41:09.133
So we leave.

41:09.758 --> 41:13.137
Okay?
All of us, the Gallaghers.

41:14.388 --> 41:16.265
We sell the house, all right?

41:16.307 --> 41:18.517
W-we each take our share,

41:18.559 --> 41:21.770
and you and I can use that
to get our own place.

41:26.859 --> 41:29.028
You think your family
would go for it?

41:29.069 --> 41:31.405
All right, maybe it's time
we make gentrification

41:31.447 --> 41:32.990
our friend.

41:34.241 --> 41:36.452
All right?
We...

41:36.494 --> 41:37.661
we cash in.

41:37.703 --> 41:40.664
upbeat music

41:54.178 --> 41:56.180
[Ian sighs]

41:57.515 --> 41:59.433
Long fucking day.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.726
Gotta get over to The Alibi,

42:00.768 --> 42:02.436
help your brother
unload those bikes.

42:02.478 --> 42:04.772
[Terry]  Motherfuckers,
get me into the house!

42:04.813 --> 42:06.440
It's gonna rain out here!

42:06.482 --> 42:08.317
Shut the fuck up!

42:08.359 --> 42:10.194
[Terry]  Fuck you!

42:15.658 --> 42:18.702
Would you take care of me
if I was paralyzed?

42:24.250 --> 42:25.709
Yeah.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.419
Yeah.

42:27.461 --> 42:28.754
You'd make a great RealDoll.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.756
Top you whenever I wanted.

42:31.966 --> 42:32.967
Asshole.

42:33.008 --> 42:35.427
[Terry]  Come and get me,
you ungrateful shits!

42:35.469 --> 42:38.472
rock music

42:39.557 --> 42:41.183
Be right back.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.361
[Terry] What the fuck you want?

42:52.403 --> 42:53.571
Shut it!

43:03.956 --> 43:04.707
Ouch!

43:04.748 --> 43:06.584
Aw, your drugs wearing off?

43:06.625 --> 43:08.752
You're fucking clumsy.
That's the fucking problem.

43:08.794 --> 43:10.379
Get out and help me push,
tough guy.

43:10.421 --> 43:11.672
[Terry] Egh.

43:11.714 --> 43:14.091
-[wheelchair thuds]
-Oh, God.

43:14.758 --> 43:15.968
Can I help?

43:16.010 --> 43:17.261
Fuck no!

43:18.512 --> 43:20.681
Stop looking at me.

43:24.518 --> 43:25.978
Don't drop me, limp wrist.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.229
Charming.

43:27.271 --> 43:30.107
[both grunting]

43:39.658 --> 43:41.535
I got the door.

43:41.577 --> 43:43.120
It's locked.

43:44.496 --> 43:45.664
Think we've done enough.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.541
Fuck you very much.

43:55.549 --> 43:57.092
That was big of you.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.719
He's an asshole.

43:58.761 --> 44:00.679
I wanna be better than that.

44:00.721 --> 44:02.389
Hey.

44:02.431 --> 44:04.850
You are so much better
than that.

44:07.269 --> 44:10.272
rock music

44:14.777 --> 44:16.654
[Veronica] Please tell
Alderman Jenkins

44:16.695 --> 44:18.572
that I expect
a callback today.

44:18.614 --> 44:20.616
He's got me canvassing
the whole of the South Side.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.493
The least he can do
is help me with this.

44:22.534 --> 44:24.036
All right, thank you.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.538
Hey, babe.
How was class mom day?

44:26.580 --> 44:27.706
Did you know
that they are running

44:27.748 --> 44:29.083
active shooter drills
at that school?

44:29.124 --> 44:30.793
Yeah, I talked to the girls
about it last night.

44:30.834 --> 44:32.586
I gave them our brownie pans

44:32.628 --> 44:33.712
so they could use it
as shields.

44:33.754 --> 44:34.797
How'd that work out?

44:34.838 --> 44:35.881
It did not work out.

44:35.923 --> 44:37.925
We hid in a bathroom
for half an hour.

44:37.966 --> 44:39.134
I had to turn away some kid

44:39.176 --> 44:40.678
who was trying to get in there
for shelter.

44:40.719 --> 44:42.471
He got pretend shot
out there

44:42.513 --> 44:44.348
and had to act
like he was dead, Kev.

44:44.390 --> 44:46.016
-Dead.
-Sounds kind of fun.

44:46.058 --> 44:47.601
It wasn't.
I spent my whole day

44:47.643 --> 44:49.561
trying to put an end
to those drills--

44:49.603 --> 44:50.688
What's that?

44:50.729 --> 44:52.106
I'm cleaning out Kev-Fit.

44:52.147 --> 44:54.566
Some people just left
some old, sweaty equipment

44:54.608 --> 44:56.485
-before the quarantine.
-What kind of stuff?

44:56.527 --> 44:59.113
Oh, jump rope, weights,
some basketballs.

44:59.154 --> 45:02.449
[rock music playing
over speakers]

45:03.909 --> 45:06.787
Kev, we can use this

45:06.829 --> 45:08.956
to bring gym class back
for the girls.

45:08.997 --> 45:10.499
You think anyone'll miss it?

45:10.541 --> 45:11.875
Members got 'rona and died, V.

45:11.917 --> 45:14.086
I don't think anybody's
coming back for it.

45:14.128 --> 45:17.840
Yes, this is good.
I can use this.

45:17.881 --> 45:19.800
And now all I gotta do
is get Black folks

45:19.842 --> 45:21.135
moving back
into the neighborhood.

45:21.176 --> 45:22.678
Black folks
don't shoot up schools.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.012
When Mikaela
has a problem with Laquon,

45:24.054 --> 45:25.514
she knows she gotta go
to his mama's house,

45:25.556 --> 45:26.473
handle it there.

45:26.515 --> 45:28.058
White folks are the only ones

45:28.100 --> 45:30.936
running around with AR-15s
strapped to their chest.

45:30.978 --> 45:33.564
Guns should've been outlawed
hundreds of years ago.

45:33.605 --> 45:34.815
Machine guns, yeah.

45:34.857 --> 45:37.943
All guns.
What's anyone need a gun for?

45:38.736 --> 45:40.195
Protection.

45:40.237 --> 45:41.613
Kev?

45:42.781 --> 45:44.867
What?

45:55.210 --> 45:58.589
Well, well, well.

45:58.630 --> 46:00.966
What do we have here?

46:02.468 --> 46:05.471
Holy shit.

46:13.937 --> 46:17.149
It's the end of an era,
my worthy foe.

46:18.609 --> 46:22.070
I admit, I wish you had fallen
by my sword,

46:22.112 --> 46:24.865
but an act of God
will have to do.

46:24.907 --> 46:27.493
-[groans]
-[softly] Shoot me.

46:28.994 --> 46:30.579
Did you say something?

46:30.621 --> 46:32.456
I said shoot me.

46:36.460 --> 46:37.628
I'd share with you,

46:37.669 --> 46:40.339
but I don't know
how you drink now.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.299
Probably a sippy cup, eh?

46:46.762 --> 46:50.265
Do not go gently
into that good night.

46:51.391 --> 46:52.518
You know what that means?

46:52.559 --> 46:57.147
It's Welsh for "giving up
is for pussies."

46:57.773 --> 47:00.901
I never took you
for a coward, Terry.

47:00.943 --> 47:02.611
A racist, yeah.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.488
Stinking redneck, definitely.

47:04.530 --> 47:06.365
But a coward...

47:07.825 --> 47:09.493
...that's new.

47:21.588 --> 47:24.716
We had some good days, though,

47:24.758 --> 47:27.344
running the South Side,

47:27.386 --> 47:29.096
battling over territory,

47:29.137 --> 47:32.224
the Milkoviches
versus the Gallaghers.

47:32.266 --> 47:34.810
[Terry]
Yeah, it was a goddamn saga.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.728
[Frank] For the history books.

47:37.563 --> 47:40.023
I guess the least I could do...

47:41.567 --> 47:43.902
...is a mercy killing.

47:43.944 --> 47:46.405
May you go with dignity.

47:55.414 --> 47:56.456
Nah.

47:56.498 --> 47:59.501
rock music

48:07.259 --> 48:10.053
I just don't like you
that much.

48:16.518 --> 48:18.604
Have a good night.

48:18.645 --> 48:21.565
[laughs]

48:30.949 --> 48:33.076
Fucking Gallaghers.

48:40.709 --> 48:42.878
[Sandy] Debs.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.755
Can we talk?

48:44.796 --> 48:47.841
melancholy rock music

48:49.509 --> 48:51.136
Scram.

48:52.554 --> 48:53.639
Come on, fuck off.

48:53.680 --> 48:56.808
Here we are

48:56.850 --> 49:00.312
We had a ball

49:00.354 --> 49:02.940
- Are you having fun...
-I do wanna tell you things.

49:02.981 --> 49:04.399
It's not that I don't.

49:04.441 --> 49:06.151
It's just...

49:06.193 --> 49:09.863
some things, I really don't
like to think about.

49:12.491 --> 49:13.867
Okay.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.164
When I met Royal...

49:20.874 --> 49:22.167
Can you turn around?

49:22.209 --> 49:23.669
-Hmm?
-Can you turn around?

49:23.710 --> 49:25.045
I think this might be easier

49:25.087 --> 49:27.464
if I don't have to look
at your face.

49:27.506 --> 49:28.632
Okay.

49:28.674 --> 49:31.134
Just...
[clears throat]

49:31.176 --> 49:33.971
Here I go

49:36.390 --> 49:39.601
[sighs]

49:39.643 --> 49:42.562
When I met Royal,

49:42.604 --> 49:45.691
I was 15...

49:45.732 --> 49:47.442
in a tight spot.

49:47.484 --> 49:49.820
I mean, you know my family.
You get it.

49:49.861 --> 49:51.363
[chuckles]

49:52.239 --> 49:55.575
And he offered me
a better life,

49:55.617 --> 49:57.452
so I said yes.

49:57.494 --> 49:59.329
We got married.

50:00.914 --> 50:02.958
I tried to make it work.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.669
I-I really fucking did, but...

50:07.546 --> 50:09.548
...I had to get out.

50:11.258 --> 50:14.803
So I've been going
from car to couch ever since.

50:15.804 --> 50:17.305
And no matter
how shitty things are,

50:17.347 --> 50:21.393
at least I know I never have
to be with that fucker again.

50:22.519 --> 50:27.190
So you don't have to worry.
There's...nothing going on.

50:36.867 --> 50:38.577
I love you.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.747
What?

50:41.788 --> 50:43.040
I love you.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.336
Shit.

50:48.378 --> 50:51.590
I think I might love you too.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.844
[Tish] Wow.

50:55.886 --> 50:58.305
I love your place.

50:58.346 --> 51:00.724
[chuckles]
And the recliner.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.934
-[chuckles]
-Great choice.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.229
Oh.

51:16.156 --> 51:17.866
Your benefit package is huge.

51:17.908 --> 51:20.744
[both giggle]

51:20.786 --> 51:22.287
[Tish] Mm.

51:26.833 --> 51:30.545
disquieting rock music

51:37.010 --> 51:38.345
Hang on.
Let me find a condom first.

51:38.386 --> 51:40.305
Oh, it's okay.
I don't need it.

51:40.347 --> 51:42.349
Honestly, it feels
so much better without it.

51:42.390 --> 51:44.267
I know, for me too,
trust me, but...

51:44.309 --> 51:46.436
-I just have this one rule.
-[Tish] Come on.

51:46.478 --> 51:48.522
Officer,
it's not that big a deal.

51:48.563 --> 51:50.982
Look, I do it all the time.
I never got pregnant.

51:51.024 --> 51:54.778
Just-just pull out.

52:01.576 --> 52:02.911
[Tish] Mm, mm.

52:05.831 --> 52:09.918
[laughter]

52:09.960 --> 52:11.086
It would be so hot

52:11.128 --> 52:13.255
if I could really feel you
inside me right...

52:13.296 --> 52:15.757
[Carl]
Oh. Oh, shit.

52:15.799 --> 52:19.427
[Tish moaning]

52:23.265 --> 52:25.350
[Carl sighs]

52:25.392 --> 52:27.018
I had a really nice time.

52:27.060 --> 52:29.187
Uh...yeah.
[chuckles]

52:29.229 --> 52:30.313
I'd love to do this again.

52:30.355 --> 52:32.649
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-Tomorrow?

52:32.691 --> 52:33.692
Sure.

52:33.733 --> 52:34.901
Great.
It's a date.

52:34.943 --> 52:37.028
-I'll cook.
-[chuckles]

52:38.697 --> 52:39.990
-Bye.
-Bye.

52:42.409 --> 52:44.578
What's the matter, Carl?
You couldn't get it up?

52:44.619 --> 52:45.787
No, I came.

52:45.829 --> 52:47.873
You couldn't make her come?

52:47.914 --> 52:48.999
[Carl] No.

52:49.958 --> 52:51.459
[Frank]
Happens to the best of us.

52:51.501 --> 52:54.629
The female anatomy
is a wondrous mystery.

52:54.671 --> 52:55.505
It's really not.

52:55.547 --> 52:58.091
[Carl] Something weird
happened with that girl.

52:58.133 --> 52:59.217
Her name was Tish.

52:59.259 --> 53:00.218
Yeah, that is weird, man.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.344
Shut up.
I wanna hear this.

53:01.386 --> 53:03.388
She didn't wanna use
a condom, but I did.

53:03.430 --> 53:05.182
You know,
I tried to put one on anyway,

53:05.223 --> 53:06.766
but she was all over me,

53:06.808 --> 53:08.476
kissing, grabbing.

53:08.518 --> 53:09.978
And then when I was ready,
I tried to pull out,

53:10.020 --> 53:11.271
but she wrapped her legs
so tight

53:11.313 --> 53:13.815
and wouldn't let me, and...

53:13.857 --> 53:15.942
I-I don't know what happened.

53:15.984 --> 53:18.403
I...guess...

53:18.445 --> 53:20.488
she did it with me.

53:20.530 --> 53:23.200
I-I don't know.
It's hard to explain.

53:23.241 --> 53:25.577
No, it's not.
She raped you.

53:25.619 --> 53:28.163
What?
No, I wanted to have sex.

53:28.205 --> 53:31.875
Well, did you wanna have sex
with her without a condom?

53:31.917 --> 53:32.542
No.

53:32.584 --> 53:34.544
[Debbie] Did you tell her that?

53:34.586 --> 53:35.503
Yeah.

53:35.545 --> 53:38.089
And she ignored that boundary.

53:38.131 --> 53:39.507
I guess.

53:39.549 --> 53:42.510
You're lucky
you got to raw-dog her, son.

53:42.552 --> 53:46.848
Most women carry
their own condoms these days.

53:47.599 --> 53:48.767
-[Lip] Hey!
-[Debbie] Hey.

53:48.808 --> 53:51.228
Good, I was, uh, hoping
to catch you all home.

53:51.269 --> 53:52.229
-[Ian] Yo.
-We wanted to talk

53:52.270 --> 53:53.355
to y'all about something.

53:53.396 --> 53:54.439
[Debbie] You pregnant?

53:54.481 --> 53:55.523
No. Um, we wanted--

53:55.565 --> 53:57.234
-[Ian] You're dying.
-No, just...hold on.

53:57.275 --> 54:00.487
Jesus Christ, could we just
have a, uh, family meeting?

54:00.528 --> 54:01.821
-All right?
-How long is it gonna take?

54:01.863 --> 54:03.782
I'm fucking starving, Lip.

54:03.823 --> 54:05.951
We, uh...

54:05.992 --> 54:08.578
we were thinking
we wanna sell the house.

54:09.579 --> 54:14.125
You know, I mean this house,
the, uh...the Gallagher house.

54:14.167 --> 54:15.669
You know, if we fix it up
a little bit,

54:15.710 --> 54:18.088
like Tami and I did
with Milton's,

54:18.129 --> 54:20.298
uh, we could make
a nice profit.

54:20.340 --> 54:21.967
We'd each take our share,

54:22.008 --> 54:24.427
and, uh, you know, we could...

54:24.469 --> 54:26.429
get on with our lives.

54:33.561 --> 54:37.983
[elevated train
rattling in background]

54:39.901 --> 54:40.819
Fuck that.

54:40.860 --> 54:42.946
Good idea, but no way.
You're not selling my house.

54:42.988 --> 54:46.449
-[Ian] We're in.
-[all arguing]

54:48.410 --> 54:52.163
[Ian] It's not  your  house.

54:52.205 --> 54:55.083
[arguing continues, muffled]

54:55.125 --> 54:58.211
pensive guitar music

55:12.434 --> 55:14.519
"My name is Frank Gallagher.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.439
I live at 2119 Wallace..."

55:21.151 --> 55:22.819
Dementia?

55:24.070 --> 55:26.489
Anywhere with my heart

55:26.531 --> 55:29.075
Only small things hurt

55:29.117 --> 55:31.703
All the small things live

55:31.745 --> 55:34.331
Places you can't stay

55:40.587 --> 55:45.800
I say you fooled it all

55:50.430 --> 55:53.850
[phones ringing]
[indistinct chatter]

55:58.521 --> 56:00.148
Can I help you?

56:00.190 --> 56:01.191
Yeah, yeah.

56:01.232 --> 56:03.943
I'm here to report
a sexual assault.

56:03.985 --> 56:05.653
[sighs]

56:05.695 --> 56:08.323
Another woman falls prey
to the patriarchy.

56:08.365 --> 56:09.574
What's her name?

56:09.616 --> 56:13.745
Uh...Carl...uh, Carl.

56:14.579 --> 56:19.292
Ah, the good ole days

56:19.334 --> 56:20.960
Hey, Dr. Mantis

56:21.002 --> 56:24.381
My brain's
not quite together

56:24.422 --> 56:26.424
I've got just the thing

56:26.466 --> 56:29.594
Gonna make it all
quite better

56:29.636 --> 56:32.055
Remember, ah ah

56:32.097 --> 56:34.599
The good ole days

56:34.641 --> 56:37.227
Remember, ah ah

56:37.268 --> 56:39.646
The good ole days

56:39.687 --> 56:42.399
Remember, ah ah

56:42.440 --> 56:53.075
The good ole days
