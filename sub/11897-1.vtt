What are you smiling about?

01:09.151 --> 01:10.880
Tell me.

01:12.621 --> 01:14.145
Penny for your thoughts?

01:27.469 --> 01:28.595
I kissed Emily.

01:32.808 --> 01:35.208
Where?

01:35.277 --> 01:37.245
Duh, on the lips.

01:40.849 --> 01:42.180
What's wrong?

01:45.854 --> 01:47.515
Penny for your thoughts?

02:00.102 --> 02:02.366
What's wrong?

02:03.630 --> 02:05.621
You kissed the wrong girl.

02:05.699 --> 02:07.291
[boy screams]

02:07.367 --> 02:09.392
Help!

02:12.072 --> 02:13.801

Help!

Please, help!

Scott, you all right?

04:33.272 --> 04:35.740
I'm good.
Let's go. Come on!

04:43.515 --> 04:44.846
I'm open. Pass the ball!

05:26.325 --> 05:27.815
How's the knee?

05:27.893 --> 05:29.258
Yeah, good.
Cool, cool.

05:29.328 --> 05:30.989
You going
to Brock's party?

05:31.063 --> 05:33.224
Yeah, definitely.
I'll see you there, man.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.513
I'd like to order delivery.

05:51.583 --> 05:54.575
[grunting]

05:56.755 --> 05:58.245
[Scott] I told you
I was coming.

05:58.323 --> 05:59.415
Just making sure.

05:59.491 --> 06:01.015
[coughs]
Assholes.

06:01.093 --> 06:03.186
You can thank Jules.
It was her idea.

06:03.262 --> 06:04.524
You're still assholes.

06:04.596 --> 06:07.531
[dance music]

06:20.245 --> 06:22.713
Hey, Karen.
Have you seen Jules?

06:22.781 --> 06:25.409
No, sorry.

06:35.294 --> 06:36.693
Shit.

06:36.762 --> 06:38.195
What are you
doing up here?

06:38.263 --> 06:39.890
I'm just keeping
my eye on you.

06:39.965 --> 06:41.626
They're pulling him
out of the car.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.327
He looks so hot.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.233
Who... who said that?
Stop.

06:45.304 --> 06:47.204
Oh, he's talking
to Karen.

06:47.272 --> 06:48.637
You know she's
completely

06:48.707 --> 06:50.072
over the freaking
moon for you.

06:50.142 --> 06:51.507
No, she isn't.
You're oblivious.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.703
You didn't have
to abduct me.

06:52.778 --> 06:53.676
I was coming anyways.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.804
You liar.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.348
Psycho.
Valid.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.350
[girls laughing in hall]

06:59.418 --> 07:00.544
Come on.

07:15.434 --> 07:19.029
You know, I was just going
to order pizza and pass out at home.

07:19.104 --> 07:21.095
[laughing]
Yeah, I knew it.

07:21.173 --> 07:22.265
No, you didn't.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.332
I freaking knew it.

07:24.409 --> 07:26.604
Don't say that word.
What?

07:26.678 --> 07:28.509
I don't care what you say.
I'm bringing it back.

07:33.118 --> 07:36.417
You know I would have
come over if it was pizza.

08:04.683 --> 08:06.150
Backyard is
off limits, guys.

08:06.218 --> 08:07.446
Our bad.

08:10.455 --> 08:13.322
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:13.392 --> 08:14.723
You should have
passed the ball.

08:16.995 --> 08:18.462
We won, right?

08:18.530 --> 08:20.157
You know I'm faster
than you, so...

08:20.232 --> 08:21.494
so next time,
just pass it.

08:21.567 --> 08:22.556
You won't
get lucky again.

08:22.634 --> 08:23.658
Is that right?

08:23.735 --> 08:26.067
Guys, please don't.

08:28.307 --> 08:30.673
[chatting]

08:37.381 --> 08:39.282
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

08:39.351 --> 08:40.283
Oh, here we go!

08:40.352 --> 08:42.183
Here we go.

08:42.254 --> 08:43.585
Go!

08:49.161 --> 08:51.186
[Scott yells]

08:51.263 --> 08:52.787
Scott!
Jesus, Scott!

08:52.865 --> 08:54.355
Scott, are you okay?
What happened?

08:54.433 --> 08:55.764
My knee.

08:55.834 --> 08:57.131
Can you sit up?
Can you move?

08:57.202 --> 08:58.829
[Scott groaning]

09:10.382 --> 09:12.509
[Velcro]

10:30.696 --> 10:33.859
You should take it easy
on the running.

10:33.932 --> 10:35.797
Didn't the doctor say
it would take two years

10:35.867 --> 10:37.698
for the ligaments
to fully heal?

10:37.769 --> 10:39.134
What's it been,
six months?

10:39.204 --> 10:40.569
I need to get
back on the field

10:40.639 --> 10:42.436
if I want to get
a scholarship.

10:42.507 --> 10:44.099
Your mom and I
can pay for school.

10:44.176 --> 10:45.973
You mean you
can pay for it.

10:49.614 --> 10:51.514
Are you going
to make your move?

10:58.890 --> 10:59.822
Checkmate.

11:05.180 --> 11:07.944
<i>[woman, reading]
Tonight I was not so mutinous.</i>

11:08.016 --> 11:09.984
<i>Nor so miserable.</i>

11:10.052 --> 11:15.012
<i>My Sisera lay quiet
in the tent, slumbering.</i>

11:15.090 --> 11:18.457
And as his pain ached
through his slumber,

11:18.527 --> 11:20.825
something like an angel,

11:20.896 --> 11:22.955
the ideal, knelt near.

11:23.031 --> 11:25.556
It's clear that some
of you liked Villette.

11:25.634 --> 11:27.534
And some of you thought
it was far too long

11:27.602 --> 11:29.069
to actually read it.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.471
Nice job, Bess.

11:35.544 --> 11:38.877
Okay. Please try to read something,
anything

11:38.947 --> 11:40.812
over the summer.
[bell rings]

13:57.385 --> 13:58.682
[yells]

14:01.056 --> 14:02.523
[both gasp]

14:02.591 --> 14:03.785
Sorry, are you
all right?

14:03.858 --> 14:06.053
Yeah. Yeah,
my fault.

14:06.127 --> 14:07.458
Sorry, again.

14:24.779 --> 14:26.303
Hey, Bess.

14:26.381 --> 14:28.076
<i>Hello.</i>

14:28.149 --> 14:29.639
Was that that soccer kid?

14:29.718 --> 14:32.243
Scott something?
Scott Norris.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.185
He's cute.

14:34.256 --> 14:35.814
Was he the guy
who got drunk one night

14:35.890 --> 14:37.551
and blew out his knee?

14:37.626 --> 14:39.116
Wasn't his fault.

14:41.596 --> 14:43.621
Well, whose fault was it?
[man] Is that you, Andie?

14:44.633 --> 14:46.533
Yeah, David.

14:46.601 --> 14:49.069
Could you come
back here for one second?

14:51.072 --> 14:52.733
Hey, what are you
doing back here?

14:52.807 --> 14:54.775
Checking inventory.

14:54.843 --> 14:56.743
Are you hiding
from Bess?

14:56.811 --> 14:58.210
No, I would never
hide from Bess.

14:58.280 --> 15:01.044
Why would you think that?

15:01.116 --> 15:04.051
She's just shy, cause, you know,
she's new to town.

15:04.119 --> 15:06.679
She probably misses
her old one.

15:06.755 --> 15:08.689
Trust me, I know
the feeling.

15:08.757 --> 15:10.452
You do?
Mm-hmm.

15:10.525 --> 15:13.551
Don't tell me you're missing
Ball-sac-ramento.

15:13.628 --> 15:16.791
You have a nice laugh.
You should try it more often.

15:18.433 --> 15:21.425
I should get back out there.
Okay.

15:31.313 --> 15:33.713
Hey, your friend
Jeffrey is back again.

15:35.183 --> 15:36.707
He's not my friend.

15:40.822 --> 15:43.586
See you tomorrow, Andie.
Bye.

15:43.658 --> 15:45.387
See you, Bess.

15:49.064 --> 15:50.827
[Andie reads]
I want to sit next to you.

15:50.899 --> 15:52.833
I want to be your friend.

15:52.901 --> 15:55.392
I want to be as important
to you as she is.

15:55.470 --> 15:56.994
What is this?

15:57.072 --> 16:00.166
It's called
Notes to Crushes.

16:00.241 --> 16:03.005
Seems a little weird.

16:05.013 --> 16:07.413
I mean, I should know.

16:07.482 --> 16:10.918
I did so much weird
stuff in High School.

16:10.985 --> 16:12.976
Like what?

16:13.054 --> 16:14.681
[laughs]

16:14.756 --> 16:17.247
I waited for guys
outside their home.

16:17.325 --> 16:19.623
I sent them anonymous
love letters.

16:19.694 --> 16:21.491
I even made friends
with their girlfriends

16:21.563 --> 16:24.031
to see what they liked
about them.

16:24.099 --> 16:27.694
Brian Solverson
was my big crush.

16:27.769 --> 16:30.636
When I get a crush,
it's bad.

16:30.705 --> 16:32.297
Me, too.

16:32.374 --> 16:34.137
Just remember,
there's a fine line

16:34.209 --> 16:36.268
between cute and creepy.

17:29.230 --> 17:31.892
[gate opens]

17:48.149 --> 17:49.013
Looking for this?

17:49.083 --> 17:50.345
[gasps]

17:50.418 --> 17:51.942
Jules!

17:53.254 --> 17:55.051
What are you doing here?

17:55.123 --> 17:56.954
Just waiting for you
to stop being weird.

17:57.025 --> 17:59.016
You're the one
hiding out on my porch.

17:59.093 --> 18:00.856
Stop. You know
what I mean.

18:00.929 --> 18:03.397
Look, I just really need to focus
on getting back

18:03.465 --> 18:05.558
on the field right now.

18:05.633 --> 18:09.296
Nothing's going to happen.
I just want to talk like we used to.

18:09.370 --> 18:11.361
I promise.

18:17.612 --> 18:19.136
I lied.

18:52.981 --> 18:54.175
[Mike]
Scotty?

18:54.249 --> 18:58.743
Shh, my dad is here.

18:58.820 --> 19:01.288
Shh! I know what you...
Shh!

19:01.356 --> 19:04.325
Ow! Come on!

19:04.392 --> 19:05.518
[Mike]
You want some food?

19:05.593 --> 19:07.151
Stop, stop, stop.

19:07.228 --> 19:08.820
I think we should stop.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.091
Are you sure?

19:10.164 --> 19:13.099
No...
Yes, I'm sure.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.022
[cell phone buzzes]

19:39.093 --> 19:42.620
That's... just so you
know what you're missing.

19:43.898 --> 19:46.128
Jules...

19:46.200 --> 19:47.758
[door shuts]

19:55.143 --> 19:56.804
Hey, Jules.
Wait up.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.174
[sighs]

20:00.248 --> 20:01.647
I just...

20:04.586 --> 20:07.316
I need you, Jules.

20:07.388 --> 20:10.221
As a friend.

20:10.291 --> 20:13.385
And I can't handle
screwing that up right now.

20:17.231 --> 20:18.459
Okay, I get it.

20:19.601 --> 20:20.966
Thank you.

20:24.439 --> 20:27.840
I promise that's the last time
I kiss you first.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.308
Hey, Bess.

21:39.681 --> 21:40.978
How do you know
where I live?

21:43.885 --> 21:45.352
I have my ways.

21:45.420 --> 21:47.513
Have you been
following me home?

21:50.658 --> 21:52.353
Where's your family

21:53.695 --> 21:55.492
What do you mean?

21:55.563 --> 21:59.590
I've been here,
let's just say awhile.

21:59.667 --> 22:02.465
There are no lights.

22:02.537 --> 22:04.198
My parents
are travel writers.

22:04.272 --> 22:08.606
They spend their summers
researching cities.

22:08.676 --> 22:10.041
Cool.

22:11.713 --> 22:13.203
Party at your house.

22:13.281 --> 22:15.249
They'll be back soon.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.649
I made you a mix.

22:24.726 --> 22:26.853
I don't like
the music you listen to.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.192
You don't know the music
that I listen to.

22:31.232 --> 22:33.029
Just take it.

22:36.871 --> 22:38.964
[closes door firmly]

24:06.027 --> 24:08.018
[grunts]

24:24.378 --> 24:25.970
How long you been
standing there?

24:26.047 --> 24:27.810
I just got here.

24:27.882 --> 24:29.179
Thanks for the help, man.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.740
You looked like you had it.

24:32.820 --> 24:35.152
You done already?
Yeah.

24:35.223 --> 24:37.919
- Any pain?
- Nope.

27:28.996 --> 27:30.588
Good morning.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.427
Hey dad, "His Girl
Friday" is playing

27:37.505 --> 27:39.029
at the Tivoli tonight.
You want to go?

27:39.106 --> 27:41.540
I need to catch up
on work tonight.

27:41.609 --> 27:44.578
What, you love that movie.
You're the reason I love that movie.

27:46.814 --> 27:48.179
I'd like to go...

27:51.852 --> 27:53.080
Sure.

28:05.766 --> 28:07.791
[grunts]

28:08.803 --> 28:10.134
I'm so sorry.

28:10.204 --> 28:11.796
You all right?

28:11.872 --> 28:13.464
You okay?

28:14.542 --> 28:15.509
You seem okay.

28:26.787 --> 28:29.187
Do you... do you
go to Highland?

28:30.491 --> 28:32.288
I'm in your English class.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.828
Oh, sorry.

28:36.497 --> 28:37.657
What's your name?

28:37.732 --> 28:38.926
Bess.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.969
I'm Scott.
I know.

28:43.971 --> 28:46.838
What are you...
what were you listening to?

28:59.653 --> 29:01.086
Yeah, that's cool.

29:03.424 --> 29:05.255
I should get going.

29:05.326 --> 29:08.090
Well, what were
you listening to?

29:30.684 --> 29:32.117
You like it?

29:34.422 --> 29:37.050
It's Mighty Hands.

29:37.124 --> 29:38.785
I love it.
Yeah?

29:41.529 --> 29:43.463
It was nice
to meet you, Bess.

29:46.434 --> 29:47.867
See you around.

30:17.898 --> 30:19.763
Hey, Scott.

30:19.834 --> 30:21.165
[clears throat]

30:26.006 --> 30:27.769
Hey, Scott.

30:41.455 --> 30:43.184
Hey, Scott.

30:57.004 --> 30:59.029
Hey, Bess, right?

31:00.374 --> 31:01.739
Hey, Scott.

31:01.809 --> 31:03.970
Did you read my post?

31:04.044 --> 31:05.375
What post?

31:08.149 --> 31:11.380
We should probably head inside.
Okay.

31:49.657 --> 31:53.115
Hey, Scott!

31:53.194 --> 31:55.025
I thought you hated
anything black and white.

31:55.095 --> 31:56.790
Not true.

31:56.864 --> 31:59.492
Thank you.

31:59.567 --> 32:01.694
And you stand
there bellyaching

32:01.769 --> 32:03.464
about whether you catch
a eight or nine o 'clock train

32:03.537 --> 32:05.471
I never figured
it that way.

32:05.539 --> 32:07.598
You're still a doll-faced hick,
that's why.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.643
You can't move the desk.
There are cops outside.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.008
We'll lower it out the window.
Quit stalling.

32:12.079 --> 32:13.842
Come on, start
pounding out a lead.

32:13.914 --> 32:15.446
How much do you want?
All you got.

32:15.472 --> 32:16.709
Give me Duffy!

32:16.784 --> 32:18.183
Can I call the mayor
a bird of prey?

32:18.252 --> 32:20.186
Call him what you like.

32:20.254 --> 32:21.949
Give him the works.
Hello, Duffy! Get set!

33:04.465 --> 33:06.626
[squeaks]

33:14.642 --> 33:16.269
Scott?

33:20.981 --> 33:22.505
Okay, I liked it.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.483
Liar.
No.

33:26.186 --> 33:29.451
Well. You want me
to walk you home?

33:29.523 --> 33:31.286
No, I'm all right.
You sure?

33:32.626 --> 33:36.084
Yeah. Bye.

33:36.163 --> 33:37.528
Bye.

33:53.013 --> 33:55.481
[door closes]

34:33.053 --> 34:35.078
[cell phone message beep]

34:37.891 --> 34:39.916
[scoffs]

35:09.690 --> 35:11.521
[squeaks]

35:51.465 --> 35:52.830
Hey, Jeffrey.

35:56.603 --> 35:58.332
You want to get
some food?

36:00.240 --> 36:02.401
Yeah, sure.

36:02.476 --> 36:07.004
David, we're okay to close up
without Bess, aren't we?

36:07.080 --> 36:08.411
Yes.

36:09.616 --> 36:13.143
Bess, go on.

36:37.544 --> 36:40.308
[Jeffrey] You want one
from the margarita side

36:40.380 --> 36:42.610
or one from the pepperoni side?

36:42.683 --> 36:44.708
I'm not hungry.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.148
Yeah, me, neither.

37:16.683 --> 37:19.311
[both grunting]

37:19.386 --> 37:21.650
Scott Norris thinks
you're a freak.

37:23.090 --> 37:27.823
Everyone does,
except for me.

37:29.730 --> 37:32.096
You don't get to choose
who you like.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.662
I know.

38:34.795 --> 38:37.263
What makes you think
it's referring to me?

38:40.334 --> 38:41.824
Right.

38:46.940 --> 38:50.398
It could be worse.
It could be on the inside.

38:50.477 --> 38:52.604
You think this is funny?

38:58.251 --> 39:00.185
Just tell me the truth.
Did you do this?

39:00.253 --> 39:02.551
You think I wrote this?
Are you insane?

39:02.623 --> 39:05.592
Come on, you're always doing
weird stuff like this, Jules.

39:07.527 --> 39:09.961
Jules...
Just go.

39:19.106 --> 39:23.372
Hey, Scott, large drip?
Yep, thanks.

39:25.445 --> 39:28.471
Scott!

39:28.548 --> 39:30.539
Oh, hey, Miss Brown.

39:30.617 --> 39:32.881
You're not in my class anymore.
You can call me Nancy.

39:37.124 --> 39:40.389
You know I could tell
you didn't read Villette.

39:40.460 --> 39:42.223
Yes, I did.

39:42.295 --> 39:44.160
You don't think I've read
the Cliff Note answers?

39:44.231 --> 39:47.325
Then why did you give me an A?
An A minus.

39:49.503 --> 39:51.562
Sorry, I haven't had
a lot of time with rehabbing the knee.

39:51.638 --> 39:53.663
No, I know.
I get it.

39:53.740 --> 39:55.469
I see you run by my apartment
every morning.

39:55.542 --> 39:58.943
I know how hard
you've been working.

39:59.012 --> 40:00.604
You know, you should
really read Villette

40:00.681 --> 40:02.512
when you get a chance
this summer.

40:02.582 --> 40:04.573
It's one of my
favorite books.

40:04.651 --> 40:06.778
I mean, the way the ending is
so ambiguous,

40:06.853 --> 40:12.587
whether they get together
or not or even if he lives.

40:12.659 --> 40:16.618
Well, what do you think
happens in the end?

40:16.697 --> 40:18.460
I think he lives.

40:18.532 --> 40:20.557
I believe in hopeful endings.

40:22.269 --> 40:23.861
I'll read it.
I promise.

40:23.937 --> 40:27.464
Yeah? Well, give me
a call when you do.

40:27.541 --> 40:29.372
I'd like to know
what you think.

40:45.792 --> 40:48.124
Oh, hey,
Beth, right?

40:48.195 --> 40:50.390
It's Bess, with an s.

40:50.464 --> 40:54.298
Sorry. Yeah, Bess.
See you around.

40:54.367 --> 40:57.734
Are you really
going to call her?

40:57.804 --> 40:59.237
What?

40:59.306 --> 41:02.139
You run by my house
everyday, too.

41:07.080 --> 41:10.572
You know, I got
an anonymous love letter.

41:10.650 --> 41:12.743
It talked about how
I'm not just an athlete.

41:12.819 --> 41:15.879
How I'm different,
but no one sees it.

41:15.956 --> 41:18.823
That I'm misunderstood.

41:18.892 --> 41:20.655
Well, you know what?
It's wrong.

41:20.727 --> 41:22.854
And I hope whoever
wrote that letter understands

41:22.929 --> 41:26.228
and realizes to stay
away from my friends.

41:26.299 --> 41:28.164
I'll see you around.
You're wrong.

41:28.235 --> 41:31.671
You're talented.
You are different.

41:31.738 --> 41:33.672
You're an artist.

41:35.742 --> 41:37.733
Did you pick that
out of the trash?

41:41.014 --> 41:43.949
Just stop, please.

41:49.689 --> 41:51.281
Crushes suck, huh?

41:52.759 --> 41:55.125
It's good
to be realistic.

41:55.195 --> 41:56.787
You can't wait around
on someone.

41:56.863 --> 41:59.127
You might miss
the real thing.

42:02.536 --> 42:04.868
I'm going to go
open up the store.

42:07.507 --> 42:11.068
Oh, my God.
That was excruciating.

42:11.144 --> 42:13.476
Don't say anything, please.

42:13.547 --> 42:16.414
I mean, you don't know what it's like.
What? I do.

42:16.483 --> 42:18.178
A little bit.

42:30.664 --> 42:34.964
[knocking sound]

42:35.035 --> 42:36.969
[knocking continues]

43:19.679 --> 43:21.271
[inaudible]
Who?

43:51.978 --> 43:54.640
Can you just forgive me
for this, please.

43:54.714 --> 43:56.409
[inaudible]

43:56.483 --> 43:58.246
You're my best friend.

44:12.432 --> 44:14.457
You stupid bitch.

44:23.143 --> 44:24.906
[sighs]

46:24.631 --> 46:27.031
Hey.

46:27.100 --> 46:30.331
What are you doing here?
I don't know.

46:30.403 --> 46:32.871
I was just watching you.

46:32.939 --> 46:33.997
For how long.

46:34.074 --> 46:35.132
Mmm, long enough.

46:40.647 --> 46:43.377
Can I... can I
make a confession?

46:45.318 --> 46:48.014
I hired you because I thought
you were cute.

46:48.088 --> 46:49.555
Is that sexist?

46:49.622 --> 46:52.853
Um, yeah.

46:52.926 --> 46:53.858
Yeah, it kind of is.

46:53.927 --> 46:55.485
That's okay.

47:36.469 --> 47:38.198
[shouts]

47:42.775 --> 47:44.868
Scott!

47:44.944 --> 47:47.435
Yeah, no,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

47:48.615 --> 47:50.048
You're not fine.

47:50.116 --> 47:51.378
You don't have
your brace.

47:51.451 --> 47:52.918
You don't have
a spotter.

47:52.986 --> 47:54.647
No, that had nothing
to do with it.

47:54.721 --> 47:56.052
It has everything
to do with it.

47:56.122 --> 47:57.953
I thought I...

47:58.024 --> 47:59.719
I honestly don't know
what happened.

47:59.792 --> 48:01.623
It's good, Coach,
it's good.

48:01.694 --> 48:04.162
Solid, there's
nothing wrong.

48:04.230 --> 48:06.892
I'm sorry, son.

48:06.966 --> 48:08.160
What do you mean
you're sorry?

48:08.234 --> 48:09.394
Go home.

48:09.469 --> 48:11.232
I promised your dad.

48:40.433 --> 48:41.525
I know you heard.

48:41.601 --> 48:43.364
Coach Evans called.

48:43.436 --> 48:45.802
You don't even come
to my games.

48:45.872 --> 48:47.863
You have no right to strike
a deal with him,

48:47.941 --> 48:49.272
or to judge
how hurt I am.

48:51.010 --> 48:53.376
I don't want you
running for awhile.

48:53.446 --> 48:55.505
Soccer isn't the only thing
you're good at.

48:55.582 --> 48:57.015
What else
am I good at, dad?

48:57.083 --> 48:58.641
You're smart, Scott.

48:58.718 --> 49:00.117
Whether you know it or not.

49:00.186 --> 49:01.710
Your mom and I
both think so.

49:01.788 --> 49:03.187
You want to talk
about mom,

49:03.256 --> 49:04.188
then let's really
talk about her.

49:06.459 --> 49:08.552
She left us both, dad.

51:09.582 --> 51:11.550
What?

51:26.199 --> 51:28.667
[knocking]

51:28.735 --> 51:30.396
Jules!

51:32.372 --> 51:34.363
[frantic knocking]

51:36.175 --> 51:38.370
[knocking]
Jules!

52:05.705 --> 52:08.071
What the hell
is wrong with you?

52:08.141 --> 52:10.302
Do you even know
what you're doing?

52:10.376 --> 52:13.311
Sometimes I... I just
can't help myself.

52:15.314 --> 52:17.839
A normal person
doesn't act like this.

52:17.917 --> 52:19.714
Can you get that
into your head?

52:19.786 --> 52:20.980
Don't talk to her
that way.

52:21.053 --> 52:22.577
Stop, Jeffrey.

52:22.655 --> 52:24.418
Yeah, stay out of this.
You don't get it.

52:24.490 --> 52:26.424
I get that she's better
than that bitch, Jules.

52:28.394 --> 52:29.952
Jeffrey.

52:31.497 --> 52:34.728
[Jeffrey groans]

52:34.801 --> 52:37.065
Just get out!

52:37.136 --> 52:38.831
Now!

52:47.413 --> 52:49.005
[Andie]
Hey...

52:52.452 --> 52:56.081
Scott Norris
was looking for you.

52:56.155 --> 52:58.180
I know.

53:06.966 --> 53:08.695
I've seen you.

53:18.544 --> 53:22.378
[whispers]
You make it look so easy.

53:24.283 --> 53:25.614
What are you talking about?

53:27.820 --> 53:29.788
I've seen you
with David.

53:53.012 --> 53:54.809
What are you doing?

53:54.881 --> 53:56.143
Waiting for a cab.

53:56.215 --> 53:59.343
I'll be back Monday.
Sure.

53:59.418 --> 54:01.409
It came up last minute.

54:03.689 --> 54:05.748
Call your Coach.

54:05.825 --> 54:07.087
What? Why?

54:08.828 --> 54:11.126
Just call him.

54:11.197 --> 54:12.528
I'll see you Monday.

54:24.610 --> 54:25.941
One more time.

54:34.554 --> 54:38.046
Your dad seems to be against
you playing.

54:38.124 --> 54:40.285
So if he's asking me to give
you another chance...

56:21.661 --> 56:23.754
Get the hell away.
Just wait.

56:23.829 --> 56:25.888
You want to get rid of me?
Fine, you win.

56:25.965 --> 56:27.398
I will stay away from you.

56:27.466 --> 56:29.093
I didn't send it,
I swear.

56:29.168 --> 56:31.102
Well, who did?
Your secret admirer?

56:31.170 --> 56:32.398
Yes!

56:32.471 --> 56:34.735
You're not that special.

56:34.807 --> 56:37.241
Just... where are you going?

56:37.309 --> 56:38.674
Are you going
to Brock's party?

56:38.744 --> 56:40.177
Jules, you don't
have to go.

56:40.246 --> 56:41.611
I'm not going to play
some victim

56:41.681 --> 56:43.273
holed up
in her bedroom.

56:43.349 --> 56:45.180
No, Jules, just stay here
for a second

56:45.251 --> 56:47.310
and talk to me.

56:56.996 --> 56:58.258
[inaudible dialog]

57:12.511 --> 57:14.274
[gasps]
Damn.

57:16.749 --> 57:18.444
God, you scared me.

57:35.701 --> 57:37.362
Thanks.

57:41.373 --> 57:44.240
You're Bess, right?

57:44.310 --> 57:46.437
You were
in my math class.

57:49.148 --> 57:51.139
How come you always
wear black and white?

57:53.152 --> 57:56.144
It's too difficult to think
about all the other colors.

58:01.894 --> 58:03.486
Thanks for the tissue.

58:20.846 --> 58:22.473
Why were you crying?

58:26.685 --> 58:28.312
Lots of reasons.

58:32.091 --> 58:33.854
I know that feeling.

58:36.095 --> 58:37.756
I think I need
a drink.

58:40.800 --> 58:42.028
Hey...

58:43.836 --> 58:45.531
thanks for coming
up here.

58:58.884 --> 59:00.875
Are you doing okay?

59:00.953 --> 59:03.046
As long as I keep
my head buried in this glass.

59:05.691 --> 59:07.158
I'm getting
another drink.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.492
[Brock] Hey.
Hi.

59:19.638 --> 59:20.366
You doing okay?

59:21.507 --> 59:23.668
I've been better...

59:23.742 --> 59:26.802
Broccoli.

59:26.879 --> 59:29.404
You know, I can't believe
he did that to you.

59:30.983 --> 59:33.747
Makes me glad
he blew out his knee.

59:33.819 --> 59:35.684
Um, I need to lay down.

59:37.256 --> 59:38.655
Okay, do you want me to...

59:38.724 --> 59:40.316
No, I'm fine.

01:00:47.927 --> 01:00:51.385
[muffled screams]

01:01:00.172 --> 01:01:02.504
[screams]

01:01:22.461 --> 01:01:25.328
[pants roughly]

01:01:34.273 --> 01:01:36.969
[coughing]

01:02:14.747 --> 01:02:17.307
Are you sure you're going
to be okay?

01:02:17.383 --> 01:02:19.180
How could Bess
do something like that?

01:02:19.251 --> 01:02:21.048
She's insane.

01:02:23.088 --> 01:02:24.680
I'm sorry.

01:02:24.757 --> 01:02:26.019
I thought
she would stop,

01:02:26.091 --> 01:02:28.491
but she's out of control.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.528
We should go to the police.

01:02:30.596 --> 01:02:33.326
I didn't see anything
and I've been drinking.

01:02:33.399 --> 01:02:34.696
They're not
going to believe me.

01:02:44.176 --> 01:02:46.770
Then I'm going to take care
of this, okay?

01:02:46.845 --> 01:02:49.279
I'm not going to let her hurt
you again.

01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:53.917
What are you
going to do?

01:02:55.621 --> 01:02:57.088
I'll think
of something.

01:02:59.725 --> 01:03:01.283
I need to lie down.

01:03:06.231 --> 01:03:07.926
I'll be fine.

01:03:44.503 --> 01:03:46.061
[brakes screeching, crash]

01:03:46.138 --> 01:03:47.730
Shit, shit.

01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:51.167
Are you all right?

01:03:51.243 --> 01:03:54.406
I think so.
I think I slid just in time.

01:03:56.148 --> 01:03:57.581
I'm...
I'm so sorry.

01:03:58.984 --> 01:04:01.612
I'm fine. Seriously.

01:04:01.687 --> 01:04:03.678
At least
it's not bleeding.

01:04:03.755 --> 01:04:05.950
Seriously, I'm okay.

01:04:06.024 --> 01:04:09.016
I can't say the same
for my bike.

01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:24.030
Oh, God.

01:04:25.144 --> 01:04:26.805
Shit.

01:04:33.018 --> 01:04:33.950
Take this.

01:04:36.989 --> 01:04:37.887
Thank you.

01:04:39.791 --> 01:04:42.225
Um, let me take you
to the hospital.

01:04:42.294 --> 01:04:45.752
No, it's okay.
Really.

01:04:45.831 --> 01:04:47.822
Let me at least
take you home.

01:04:49.668 --> 01:04:50.896
Okay.

01:05:02.347 --> 01:05:04.577
I'm Scott, by the way.

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:06.242
Andie.

01:05:14.493 --> 01:05:16.154
Thanks.

01:05:32.344 --> 01:05:34.005
So, thanks
for dropping me off.

01:05:34.079 --> 01:05:35.979
Yeah, sure. Are you sure
you're okay?

01:05:36.048 --> 01:05:39.506
Yeah, I think
everything is in place.

01:05:39.585 --> 01:05:41.678
This is still bleeding.

01:05:41.753 --> 01:05:43.812
Just let me take you
to the hospital, please. - No.

01:05:43.889 --> 01:05:45.550
It's fine, really.

01:05:45.624 --> 01:05:50.323
I have a first aid kit inside.

01:05:50.395 --> 01:05:52.295
Well, then at least
let me help you.

01:05:54.032 --> 01:05:56.296
Okay, come on.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.167
Put your leg
up on the table.

01:06:04.243 --> 01:06:06.575
I could do this myself.

01:06:06.645 --> 01:06:09.546
I have scars
all over my legs.

01:06:09.615 --> 01:06:11.810
Trust me,
you don't want one.

01:06:13.952 --> 01:06:16.147
And if you don't
clean it properly,

01:06:17.289 --> 01:06:19.314
it will scar.

01:06:22.494 --> 01:06:24.724
Okay, I trust you.

01:06:30.402 --> 01:06:33.098
[gasps]

01:06:33.171 --> 01:06:34.570
Sorry.

01:06:59.464 --> 01:07:01.125
Almost done.

01:07:03.135 --> 01:07:05.467
All right.
Better?

01:07:07.139 --> 01:07:08.367
Good.

01:07:13.645 --> 01:07:16.113
I'm going to go
put this away.

01:07:16.181 --> 01:07:18.877
Thank you.
Yeah.

01:07:22.621 --> 01:07:24.816
Oh, nice chess board.

01:07:28.327 --> 01:07:32.559
It's just like the one in your kitchen.
What?

01:08:17.376 --> 01:08:19.844
No, I um... I got to go,
actually,

01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:21.879
I have company.

01:08:23.014 --> 01:08:25.345
Yeah, it's a man.

01:08:26.852 --> 01:08:28.786
I got to go, mom.

01:08:31.122 --> 01:08:33.023
I love you, too.

01:08:36.027 --> 01:08:37.426
Bye.

01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:53.636
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:54.576
We need to talk.

01:08:57.983 --> 01:08:59.381
About what?

01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:00.850
Where are your parents,
really?

01:09:00.919 --> 01:09:02.682
What are you
talking about?

01:09:02.754 --> 01:09:05.051
I looked them up on amazon.
They weren't there.

01:09:06.625 --> 01:09:09.651
Travel writers?
That sounds so fake.

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:11.218
Are you crazy?

01:09:11.296 --> 01:09:12.490
Are you?

01:09:13.598 --> 01:09:15.395
Hey, guys.

01:09:15.466 --> 01:09:17.662
Oh, what happened to your eye?

01:09:17.736 --> 01:09:20.033
He's fine.

01:09:20.104 --> 01:09:22.232
Okay.

01:09:22.307 --> 01:09:24.832
We're just unpacking.
Do you want to invite your friend in, Bess?

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:26.571
Can we be alone, mom?

01:09:26.645 --> 01:09:28.510
Okay.

01:10:10.188 --> 01:10:12.156
Do you like it?

01:10:12.224 --> 01:10:17.025
I wish I had more time
to make everything perfect, but...

01:10:23.568 --> 01:10:25.229
[screaming]

01:10:43.321 --> 01:10:45.346
Stupid bitch.
You have to let me go.

01:10:45.423 --> 01:10:48.153
What's wrong
with you?

01:10:48.226 --> 01:10:52.026
It's okay. I use this sometimes
to calm myself.

01:10:53.365 --> 01:10:55.333
[groans]

01:11:03.508 --> 01:11:06.204
Your dad, he left
a message.

01:11:06.278 --> 01:11:08.769
He said he landed safely.

01:11:12.517 --> 01:11:14.951
You texted
him back, "Cool."

01:11:17.022 --> 01:11:20.458
I like this phone so much better
than your other one.

01:11:26.531 --> 01:11:28.158
If it makes you
feel any better,

01:11:28.233 --> 01:11:30.758
I would have helped
you cover it up.

01:11:32.737 --> 01:11:33.863
You mean...

01:11:35.373 --> 01:11:37.534
you were going
to help me cover up

01:11:37.609 --> 01:11:40.134
murdering my parents?

01:11:41.713 --> 01:11:43.772
Yeah.

01:11:53.625 --> 01:12:00.087
I'm sorry for all the mean things
I say to you sometimes.

01:12:00.165 --> 01:12:02.326
You can say whatever you
want to me.

01:12:04.336 --> 01:12:06.327
You're a good friend,
Jeffrey.

01:12:08.006 --> 01:12:09.303
Anything but that.

01:12:11.176 --> 01:12:15.875
Okay, but are you going
to be able to handle that?

01:12:15.947 --> 01:12:18.541
Uh-huh.

01:12:18.617 --> 01:12:21.085
So you'll stop
doing weird things?

01:12:21.152 --> 01:12:22.210
Mm-hmm.

01:12:22.287 --> 01:12:26.690
Like following me.

01:12:29.661 --> 01:12:32.186
You will, like you'll stop
following me around.

01:12:32.263 --> 01:12:33.696
Yeah.

01:12:37.836 --> 01:12:42.205
So you've never done anything
weird before?

01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:46.100
Bye, Jeffrey.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:00.423
[Andie] Hey. I forgot a few
things last night.

01:13:00.492 --> 01:13:03.984
Let me guess.
Notes to Crushes?

01:13:07.065 --> 01:13:10.626
I know it hurts when
things don't work out.

01:13:10.702 --> 01:13:13.170
I loved a boy
in school.

01:13:13.238 --> 01:13:16.639
Brian Solverson.
Yeah.

01:13:16.708 --> 01:13:20.576
He had no idea who I was.

01:13:22.247 --> 01:13:24.647
He died never knowing
I existed.

01:13:24.716 --> 01:13:27.514
He died?

01:13:27.585 --> 01:13:30.145
But I promised myself that I would
never let that happen again

01:13:30.221 --> 01:13:32.712
if I found someone
like him.

01:13:34.192 --> 01:13:36.752
Have you found
someone like him?

01:13:38.663 --> 01:13:40.528
I think so.

01:13:43.668 --> 01:13:45.761
David's nice.
I like him.

01:13:51.443 --> 01:13:54.537
Can you close up?
Sure.

01:13:57.415 --> 01:14:00.509
I'll be at home
if you need me.

01:14:00.585 --> 01:14:04.282
You know, you remind me
of myself in high school.

01:15:11.422 --> 01:15:14.914
[shouts in pain, moans]

01:15:43.688 --> 01:15:45.952
[knocking]

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.891
[moaning in pain]

01:16:02.507 --> 01:16:04.941
Hey, missed you
at the store.

01:16:05.009 --> 01:16:08.775
I'm sorry for just
showing up like this.

01:16:08.847 --> 01:16:10.610
You haven't been
returning my calls, so I...

01:16:10.682 --> 01:16:12.309
I just... I can't
do this, David.

01:16:14.252 --> 01:16:16.618
What did I do wrong?

01:16:16.688 --> 01:16:18.656
Tell me. Tell me what
I did wrong.

01:16:18.723 --> 01:16:19.985
No, it's me.

01:16:20.058 --> 01:16:23.653
Please don't say that.

01:16:23.728 --> 01:16:28.631
Everywhere I go, I find someone,
and then I lose them.

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.190
I just want this time
to be different.

01:16:30.268 --> 01:16:31.929
It will be different.

01:16:32.003 --> 01:16:36.099
I... I just want to talk.

01:16:41.379 --> 01:16:43.847
Andie, I promise you

01:16:43.915 --> 01:16:45.439
I will not give up.

01:16:45.516 --> 01:16:48.178
I believe in this.
I believe in us.

01:16:56.361 --> 01:16:59.558
It would have been so much
easier if it was you.

01:17:01.532 --> 01:17:05.127
[gasping]

01:17:21.753 --> 01:17:25.553
[gasping, crying]

01:17:33.965 --> 01:17:35.557
No, this isn't for you.

01:17:40.471 --> 01:17:42.166
This is for you.

01:17:47.512 --> 01:17:50.379
People are going to start
looking for me soon.

01:17:50.448 --> 01:17:52.848
My dad's going
to be home.

01:17:52.917 --> 01:17:57.047
True. But they're
not going to think

01:17:57.121 --> 01:17:59.021
to look for you
in my basement.

01:18:07.865 --> 01:18:10.766
I'm nothing special.
I'm not worth all of this!

01:18:12.103 --> 01:18:14.128
You are wrong!

01:18:14.205 --> 01:18:16.696
Bess was right.

01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:21.745
I want you to draw me
like you drew her.

01:18:21.813 --> 01:18:24.247
I wasn't drawing Bess.

01:18:24.315 --> 01:18:26.283
Who were you drawing?

01:18:26.351 --> 01:18:27.943
That teacher?

01:18:30.822 --> 01:18:33.154
I want you to draw me

01:18:34.892 --> 01:18:36.655
like you drew her.

01:18:38.529 --> 01:18:41.123
If you do it,

01:18:41.199 --> 01:18:43.224
I'll let you go.

01:18:48.973 --> 01:18:50.804
Okay. Okay.

01:19:03.888 --> 01:19:06.254
[moaning, gasping]

01:19:08.826 --> 01:19:10.987
[shouting, crying]

01:19:14.232 --> 01:19:16.200
[screams]

01:19:16.267 --> 01:19:20.601
[both screaming]

01:19:20.671 --> 01:19:21.660
[shouting in pain]

01:19:37.188 --> 01:19:39.554
I told you
I'd let you go.

01:21:38.075 --> 01:21:39.565
I'm done.

01:22:06.204 --> 01:22:10.004
So do you like it?

01:22:20.051 --> 01:22:21.279
Can I go?

01:22:30.561 --> 01:22:32.119
What?

01:22:33.798 --> 01:22:36.028
Please don't do this.

01:22:44.475 --> 01:22:45.703
Do it again.

01:22:49.247 --> 01:22:51.545
[screams]

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.305
[Scott grunting]

01:23:30.921 --> 01:23:33.116
Bess, call 911.

01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:34.248
Are you okay?

01:23:34.325 --> 01:23:35.451
What's going on?

01:23:35.526 --> 01:23:37.551
Call 911.
[screams]

01:23:37.628 --> 01:23:39.459
Call 911.
Just dial it.

01:23:41.499 --> 01:23:43.467
911, state your
emergency.

01:23:43.534 --> 01:23:45.468
Andie, what's going on?

01:23:45.536 --> 01:23:47.265
- 911.
- Go Bess!

01:23:47.338 --> 01:23:49.203
I tried to help you.

01:23:49.273 --> 01:23:52.071
Go Bess, run!

01:23:52.143 --> 01:23:53.269
Go, Bess, go!

01:23:53.344 --> 01:23:55.244
No!

01:23:55.313 --> 01:24:02.151
[screaming, banging]

01:24:02.219 --> 01:24:03.243
Bess.

01:24:03.321 --> 01:24:04.720
Shut up, Brian!

01:24:13.497 --> 01:24:14.896
Fuck you!

01:24:23.841 --> 01:24:26.742
Bess, wake up.

01:24:50.267 --> 01:24:53.395
Thanks, both of you.

01:24:55.873 --> 01:24:59.206
[sirens approaching]

01:25:26.904 --> 01:25:28.531
[Jeffrey] Hey.

01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:31.970
What are you
doing here?

01:25:33.644 --> 01:25:37.011
Somebody just told me
to show up.

01:25:37.081 --> 01:25:39.242
You want to sit and wait
until they get here?

01:25:39.316 --> 01:25:40.476
Sure.

01:25:57.067 --> 01:25:59.934
Secret admirer, huh?

01:26:00.004 --> 01:26:02.564
Yeah, I guess.

01:26:45.883 --> 01:26:47.316
How come you're not
at the party?

01:26:49.153 --> 01:26:51.747
I have to study
for a history test.

01:26:51.822 --> 01:26:54.484
Besides, I'm not really
a party person.

01:26:58.195 --> 01:26:59.890
What are you
working on?

01:27:11.408 --> 01:27:13.899
Come on.
[sighs] Well...

01:27:16.046 --> 01:27:18.571
I'm trying to get
into art school.

01:27:54.285 --> 01:27:56.776
Hello Sophie, I'm Robert Graham.

01:27:59.023 --> 01:28:01.287
You can step outside,
thanks.

01:28:05.896 --> 01:28:09.059
Or do you prefer Andie?

01:28:09.133 --> 01:28:11.693
Or Mary?

01:28:13.304 --> 01:28:15.966
I'll be taking
your case.

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.065
Nancy Brown woke
from her coma,

01:28:18.142 --> 01:28:20.076
so that's some good news.

01:28:20.144 --> 01:28:24.080
Bad news, though, she identified you
as her attacker.

01:28:24.148 --> 01:28:27.049
What I've gotten from others,
this started with Brian Solverson.

01:28:27.117 --> 01:28:29.813
He died in high school
from an accidental drowning.

01:28:29.887 --> 01:28:31.320
No...

01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:35.224
So it wasn't an accident.

01:28:35.292 --> 01:28:39.092
No, it didn't start
with him.

01:28:39.163 --> 01:28:40.994
So who did it
start with then?

01:28:41.065 --> 01:28:41.827
Help!

01:28:45.169 --> 01:28:47.535
Can you put the book down
and look at me?

01:28:47.605 --> 01:28:50.005
I'm trying to help you.
This is important.

01:28:59.917 --> 01:29:01.851
Take your time.

01:29:01.919 --> 01:29:04.444
You're going
to be here for while.

01:29:06.624 --> 01:29:09.957
I really don't stay
in one place too long.

01:29:10.305 --> 01:29:16.505
