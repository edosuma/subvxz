01:14.142 --> 01:15.509
Good morning.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.612
Don't creep up on me like that
when I'm working.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.013
You're working?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.283
Yeah, I'm working up
the energy to fix
your breakfast.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.086
Oh, thanks.

01:26.154 --> 01:29.557
-I think I'd like...
-Grapefruit and toast.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.759
How did you know?

01:31.825 --> 01:35.296
Because today is Thursday.
And Thursday is your
grapefruit and toast day.

01:35.363 --> 01:38.366
-It is?
-Sure. Grapefruit and toast
on Thursday.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.734
Melon on Friday.
Figs on Saturday.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.371
Bacon and eggs on Sunday.
Cereal on Monday.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.105
And prunes on Tuesday.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.811
Okay, smartie.
What's Wednesday?

01:50.878 --> 01:53.247
My day off. I don't know
what you eat then.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.552
I wasn't aware
that I had a routine.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.954
Sure, you and Mr. Jefferson
are both in a rut, child.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.392
Florence, we are not in a rut.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.295
All right, I'll bet you $10
I can tell you exactly

02:07.361 --> 02:09.797
what Mr. Jefferson's
gonna do
when he comes in here.

02:09.863 --> 02:14.602
Okay, I'll take that bet
just to show you
you're wrong.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.605
All right, first he'll come in
and kiss you on your
left cheek.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.407
Then he'll grub,
"Morning, Weezy."

02:19.473 --> 02:21.475
Then he'll sit down,
bury his head in the paper,

02:21.542 --> 02:24.745
and complain how good weather
means bad business.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.847
Turn to the stock market,

02:26.914 --> 02:30.784
slam his fist down on
the table three times and say
a bad word after each one.

02:32.220 --> 02:35.122
-And then?
-And then you pay me my $10.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.862
-Oh, good morning, George.
-Good morning, Weezy.

02:41.929 --> 02:42.963
Oh...

02:43.030 --> 02:44.332
Wanna kick in another five?

02:46.400 --> 02:48.769
Look at this lousy weather.
Hmm...

02:48.836 --> 02:50.704
But, George,
it's a beautiful day.

02:50.771 --> 02:55.476
Not for my business, it ain't.
No snow, no slush, no rain
means no dirty clothes.

02:55.543 --> 02:58.946
Oh, but the sun is shining.
The birds are out.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.881
Yeah, the birds are
my only hope.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.555
Oh, the market's down, damn!

03:08.456 --> 03:09.723
Strike one.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.726
Damn!

03:12.793 --> 03:14.428
Strike two.

03:16.630 --> 03:20.200
-(GROANS)
-Sorry, Florence,
never bet against the house.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.035
-Damn!
-All right!

03:27.508 --> 03:30.778
-Florence is right, George.
We are in a rut.
-What?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.413
We are becoming
creatures of habit.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.749
You just stare at your paper
without even knowing I'm here.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.252
Sure I know
you're there, Weezy.
I kissed you, didn't I?

03:38.319 --> 03:41.789
You could have kissed
a toaster and you wouldn't
have known the difference.

03:41.855 --> 03:46.126
Yes, I would. I could
see myself in a toaster.
(LAUGHS)

03:46.193 --> 03:48.562
-Oh, George!
-I'm just kidding, Weezy.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.266
-Uh, George, would you...
-Sure.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.439
How did you know
I wasn't gonna ask you
for the sugar?

03:58.506 --> 04:01.942
-Oh, you want the sugar?
-No, I don't want the sugar.
I want the cream.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.212
Well, you've got the cream,
so what are you mad about?

04:05.279 --> 04:08.582
You're taking me for granted!
You know what I want
before I ask for it.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.050
See how much time I save?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.253
I gotta run.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.456
George,

04:15.523 --> 04:19.993
I'm sorry for yelling,
but I just feel so,

04:20.060 --> 04:22.029
so regular.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.264
That's 'cause you eat prunes
every Tuesday.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.638
Oh, I almost forgot. Here.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.673
What's this?

04:32.740 --> 04:35.008
It's a little love note Leroy
wants you to give Sally
at the Help Center.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.311
See? Now, that's thoughtful.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.381
Why don't you send me little
romantic messages anymore?

04:40.448 --> 04:43.351
There ain't nothing romantic
about this. Look.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.919
"Dear Sally,
If it's in the kitchen

04:45.986 --> 04:49.289
"or in the den,
I can't wait to see you again.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.392
"Love, Leroy,
your big teddy bear."

04:51.459 --> 04:52.860
Oh, you shouldn't have
read it.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.995
This note is
none of your business.

04:55.062 --> 04:58.298
He wrote it on the back of
a Jefferson Cleaner receipt.
That makes it my business.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.268
George, that's terrible.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.071
It sure is. I'm gonna have to
keep my diary under
lock and key.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.440
(DOORBELL RINGS)

05:06.507 --> 05:09.677
Your diary's safe. I already
read The Ugly Duckling.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.448
Who helped you
with the big words?

05:17.050 --> 05:19.119
Morning, Mr. J.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.888
Bentley, what are you
doing up so early?

05:20.954 --> 05:24.224
-I'm going bird watching
in Central Park.
-Central Park? Ha!

05:24.291 --> 05:27.227
You oughta see
some strange birds there.

05:27.294 --> 05:31.599
I was wondering if I might
borrow some window cleaner
for my binoculars.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.967
Uh, I think we have some
in the kitchen.
I'll be right back.

05:34.034 --> 05:37.471
Oh, thank you. You know,
Mr. J, you oughta come with me
on one of these outings.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.707
-They're really
quite exciting.
-Yeah, I bet.

05:39.773 --> 05:44.678
Oh, the thrill of sitting
perfectly still, not daring to
make a sound when suddenly...

05:44.745 --> 05:46.680
(WHISTLING)

05:48.248 --> 05:49.783
You know what
that was, Mr. J?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.284
Yeah. An English cuckoo.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.189
-Here, Mr. Bentley.
-Oh, thank you.

05:56.256 --> 05:59.693
I've gotta hurry up
and meet my mate at this
little out of the way pub.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.762
We always have
a smashing time there.

06:01.829 --> 06:05.533
In fact, sometimes we get
so smashed, we forget
all about the birds.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.034
-We forget all
about the birds.
-Hey, Bentley,

06:07.100 --> 06:09.770
you don't wanna
miss the birds, right?

06:09.837 --> 06:12.406
If you hurry, you might be
able to fly south with them
for the winter.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.574
Oh, I...

06:15.375 --> 06:19.713
George, we never go to
those little out of the way
restaurants anymore.

06:19.780 --> 06:23.216
That's because now we got
enough money to go to
the big in the way restaurant.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.186
Remember Luigi's?

06:26.253 --> 06:28.288
Yeah, that little dumpy
Italian joint?

06:29.657 --> 06:31.692
I loved Luigi's.

06:31.759 --> 06:35.195
You proposed to me there
while you were on
a four-hour shore leave.

06:35.262 --> 06:40.534
Oh, you looked so handsome
in your white uniform
and your cute little cap.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.335
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

06:44.772 --> 06:48.175
Remember how Luigi
and his wife came out
and serenaded us?

06:48.241 --> 06:52.012
Uh-huh. And their singing was
worse than their cooking.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.883
And then he brought
our spaghetti, and you
leaned over to kiss me, and...

06:55.949 --> 06:59.152
Yeah, and I dumped my glass
of wine in your lap. Oh...

06:59.219 --> 07:03.056
But I didn't mind,
as long as we were together.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.293
George, why don't we go
back there and have dinner?

07:06.359 --> 07:08.161
Okay. But you're gonna get
awful wet.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.763
Why?

07:09.830 --> 07:12.132
Well, they tore it down
and put up a car wash.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.939
Then let's go to
some other little
Italian restaurant tonight.

07:19.006 --> 07:22.409
Weezy, we can't tonight.
We got that Chamber of
Commerce banquet.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.645
You never said anything
about that.

07:24.712 --> 07:27.114
Well, we've been going to it
for the past five years.
I figured you'd know.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.383
So you just took it
for granted that I wanted
to go, right? Well, I don't.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.285
-But, Weezy...
-Look, I don't have time
to argue.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.254
I've got to get to
the Help Center.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.856
But I need you tonight.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.958
You need me?

07:38.025 --> 07:40.193
Yeah. I want you
right there by my side.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.030
-You do?
-Yep.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.065
I want you to sit there
and look good when
I talk business.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.804
Oh, so that's all
I'm good for, huh?
Window dressing.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.273
-Weezy, what...
-Well, if that's all you want,

07:53.340 --> 07:56.476
get a dummy out of
Macy's window and
take her with you!

08:02.249 --> 08:04.752
Hey, Sally, this is Leroy.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.921
How's my bubbling brown sugar?

08:09.189 --> 08:11.692
That ain't all, mama.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.728
Did you get my note
from Mrs. Jefferson?

08:14.795 --> 08:17.130
She ain't got there yet?

08:17.197 --> 08:22.603
Oh, no, no,
you're just gonna have to wait
and read it for yourself.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.772
I know.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.809
I'm just a big bad teddy bear.

08:32.512 --> 08:36.116
Hey, big bad teddy bear,

08:36.183 --> 08:39.152
tell Goldilocks you got
a customer who wants
his cleaning, huh?

08:39.219 --> 08:41.454
I gotta go, Sally. Bye.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.900
Well, this is it, honey.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.768
You sure you're gonna
be okay here?

08:54.835 --> 08:56.236
I think so.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.772
This is the address
on my note, isn't it?

08:58.839 --> 09:02.142
Yeah, that's right.
Jefferson Cleaners.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.445
You know, you really
should have a doctor look at
that bump on your head.

09:05.512 --> 09:10.050
Oh, it feels all right.
It's just that I can't
remember anything.

09:10.117 --> 09:13.520
Terrible. All the muggers
we have in this city.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.889
I'm just glad
I found that note
in my pocket,

09:15.956 --> 09:18.391
or else I wouldn't know
who I am.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.460
Thank you very much
for your help.

09:20.527 --> 09:23.196
Oh, don't mention it.
Look, I've really gotta
get back to work.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.865
Now here's your note.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.199
Good luck, Sally.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.567
Thank you.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.641
Thank you, sir.

09:39.647 --> 09:42.315
Oh, hi.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.785
Uh, do you know Leroy?

09:44.852 --> 09:46.253
Do I know what?

09:53.593 --> 09:56.529
-Huh?
-Well, you asked me
did I know something.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.431
Uh, no.

09:58.498 --> 10:01.101
Not something. Somebody.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.936
-Leroy.
-Yes?

10:06.406 --> 10:09.176
-Yes, you do?
-Yes I do what?

10:10.310 --> 10:12.946
-No. Leroy.
-No?

10:13.013 --> 10:15.382
Now just a minute ago
you said yes.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.987
Look, have you seen Leroy?

10:20.053 --> 10:22.422
Have I seen what?

10:26.660 --> 10:28.128
Leroy!

10:28.195 --> 10:30.363
Yes?

10:35.002 --> 10:38.338
Look, I have a note here.
It says...

10:38.405 --> 10:41.041
I know what it says.
I wrote it.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.976
-You did?
-Yeah.

10:43.043 --> 10:47.014
Then you're Leroy.
Of course I am,
Mrs. Jefferson.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.983
Mrs. Jefferson? You mean,
you and I are married?

10:50.050 --> 10:53.620
Married? Me? I'm not married.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.989
-Am I married?
-Well, of course.

10:56.056 --> 10:59.359
-Oh, no! I'm having an affair.
-You are?

11:00.627 --> 11:02.429
With who?

11:02.495 --> 11:06.233
-With you.
-With me?

11:06.299 --> 11:10.037
Mrs. Jefferson, you sure
you're feeling all right?

11:10.103 --> 11:13.640
Well, I took a bump
on the head.
I'm still a little shaky.

11:13.707 --> 11:17.244
You wait right there.
I'm gonna get you
a glass of water.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.479
I better get one for me, too.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.756
Mmm... Guess who.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.231
How dare you!

11:38.298 --> 11:40.067
What did you do that for?

11:40.133 --> 11:42.102
I don't kiss strangers.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.571
What are you talking about?
It's me. George!

11:44.637 --> 11:47.174
George? George who?

11:54.147 --> 11:57.684
It's terrible! With
seven-and-a-half million
people in New York,

11:57.751 --> 12:00.253
what are the odds
of Miss Jefferson
getting mugged?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.189
These days, about 50-50.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.359
That poor woman.
And now she's got amnesia.

12:06.426 --> 12:10.898
-What's gonna become of her?
-Oh, take it easy, dear.
Here, sit down.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.900
I'll make some coffee.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.036
Well, you'll need
some clean cups,

12:16.103 --> 12:17.938
so while you're in there,
you better wash the dishes.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.579
-Come right in, Dr. Norris.
-Thank you.

12:26.646 --> 12:27.647
-Hello.
-How do you do?

12:27.714 --> 12:29.616
This is where we live.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.390
Come ahead, Louise.
It's all right.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.927
See? Dr. Norris said
it's all right. Come on in.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.197
Hey, look who's here.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.499
It's our maid, Florence,
and your best friend, Helen.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.301
Helen.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.607
No, that's Florence. This is
Helen Willis. Remember?

12:56.910 --> 13:00.413
(ENUNCIATING)
Hello, Mrs. Jefferson.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.684
My name is Florence.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.686
How are you?

13:07.988 --> 13:12.192
Florence, she lost her memory,
not her hearing.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.694
Louise, why don't you wander
around the apartment.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.865
-See if anything
comes to mind.
-Okay.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.267
Is she gonna be all right?

13:20.333 --> 13:22.302
Yeah. When will her memory
be back?

13:22.369 --> 13:24.671
Well, it's hard to say.
Could take an hour.

13:24.737 --> 13:28.275
Oh, yeah? Maybe she'd
still be able to make
that banquet tonight.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.044
Or it could take a day,
maybe even a year.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.580
A year? Oh, Lord.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.783
A whole year living with
somebody who can't
remember,

13:36.850 --> 13:38.785
and somebody
I'd like to forget.

13:44.691 --> 13:48.361
The main thing to remember is
that her mind is searching for
something to grab on to.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.764
Some sort of clue.
A person, a familiar object.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.334
Anything that could
jar her memory.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.136
Yeah, but that could
take forever.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.405
Be patient, George.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.707
I'll call tomorrow to see
how she's doing.

14:00.773 --> 14:01.808
Bye.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.010
-Bye, Doctor.
-Louise?

14:03.076 --> 14:06.513
Goodbye, Doctor.
Oh, Mr. Jefferson.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.949
Mr. Jefferson?

14:09.016 --> 14:12.452
She says she wants to get to
know me better before
she calls me "George".

14:13.420 --> 14:14.888
Coffee time.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.790
Who's that? Our butler?

14:19.659 --> 14:22.662
No. That's my husband, Tom.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.165
That's your husband?

14:25.598 --> 14:26.666
Yes.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.707
-I don't remember
either of you.
-Oh...

14:34.774 --> 14:37.044
Amnesia does have
some benefits.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.013
I've got an idea.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.250
Why don't we talk
about something that
we all did together.

14:43.316 --> 14:47.921
Yes. Oh, remember
the birthday party
we had down here.

14:47.988 --> 14:51.524
Oh, yeah. That's when
we had that big pillow fight.
Yeah, I remember.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.560
It all started
when I hit Willis
with a pillow like this.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.528
(GROANS)

14:55.595 --> 14:58.831
Oh... Yes, that's right.
And then I hit you back
like this.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.501
Uh-huh. Then I hit Helen
like this.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.436
Yes. And then I hit
Helen like that.

15:05.838 --> 15:06.906
Hey...

15:06.974 --> 15:09.977
Hey, she's laughing!
She's laughing!

15:10.043 --> 15:11.444
Weezy, you remember that?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.846
No, but I sure wish
I could have
been here to see it.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.686
You were here.
It was your birthday party.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.721
Maybe you should
rest a while, Louise.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.092
That's right.
A little rest and you'll
forget about everything.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.860
I mean,
remember about everything.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.530
-I mean, uh...
-Tom, let's go.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.433
Right. Well, goodbye, Louise.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.670
Goodbye,
Mrs. Willis, Mr. Willis.
It was nice meeting you.

15:37.737 --> 15:38.738
Oh.

15:41.808 --> 15:45.378
Mr. Jefferson,
could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.080
Sure. Come on, Florence.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.417
Why? It don't take two people
to get one glass of water.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.120
I know that. I want you
to fix her something to eat.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.422
Maybe your awful cooking
will help her
remember something.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.457
We'll be right back, Louise.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.199
(DOORBELL RINGS)

16:14.107 --> 16:16.809
I saw a Common Loon.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.683
I beg your pardon?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.685
He was standing in the brush.

16:25.752 --> 16:29.856
When suddenly he raised
his head and gave
a tremendous cry.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.992
(IMITATES COMMON LOON'S CRY)

16:38.665 --> 16:41.334
Oh, I became
so excited, Mrs. J.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.802
Mrs. J?

16:44.371 --> 16:47.740
Oh, hey, don't worry, Weezy.
It's Mr. Bentley.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.476
He's not crazy. He's English.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.281
Mrs. J, you disappeared
before I finished my story.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.184
-(IMITATES COMMON LOON'S CRY)
-Bentley!

16:57.250 --> 16:59.086
Louise has amnesia.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.520
Amnesia?

17:00.587 --> 17:03.022
Yeah. She got hit on the head
and lost her memory.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.192
Oh, Mrs. J, what bad luck.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.060
Do you remember
where you lost it?

17:11.264 --> 17:14.567
Do you remember
giving me this
window cleaner this morning?

17:14.634 --> 17:17.170
Uh, just put it
in the kitchen,
Mr. Bentley.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.744
-Uh, may I ask you something?
-Of course.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.914
What exactly do you do here?

17:27.980 --> 17:30.150
I'm the maid.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.685
But I haven't seen you
do any work yet.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.122
Well...

17:41.561 --> 17:44.764
Hey, that's telling her,
Weezy. (CHUCKLES)

17:44.831 --> 17:46.899
I'm really quite tired.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.202
Maybe if I laid down
for a while.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.205
-Oh, where's the bedroom?
-Oh, here. I'll show you.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.840
Can't you just tell me?

17:53.906 --> 17:56.209
It's right down the hall
to the right. Come on.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.846
Uh, I don't think I'd feel
comfortable in there with you.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.348
Sure, you will.
It's a new mattress.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.750
Uh...

18:03.816 --> 18:07.654
I think you'd better
sleep on the couch until
my memory comes back.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.757
On the couch? Huh.

18:10.823 --> 18:14.261
Shoot. Buzz off, Bentley.
Get out here.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.095
What is it, Mr. J?

18:16.163 --> 18:18.097
Look, we got to
do something to help
Weezy get her memory back.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.833
You know, I once saw
this movie where a man
had amnesia,

18:20.900 --> 18:25.605
and his family re-enacted
an event from his past
in order to bring him around.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.140
Hey, that sounds great.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.876
We could re-enact the night
at Luigi's when I proposed.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.711
I'm sure Weezy
would remember that.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.580
That's one night
I'd wanna forget.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.883
She was talking about that
just this morning.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.852
Look, Bentley, you go
be Luigi, get some wine
from the kitchen.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.888
Florence, put some
bread sticks on the table.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.857
-And bring out that spaghetti
we had last night.
-But it's cold.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.126
It can't taste no worse cold
than it did warm.

Oh, here it is.

I could borrow?

four hours before I have to be
back on ship, so come on.

but it isn't working.

will you just give it
a chance?

Watch this.

Hey, now what do I look like?

all the time.

about the whole thing.

to get you back.
