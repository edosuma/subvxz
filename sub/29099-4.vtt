WEBVTT

00:11.054 --> 00:12.360
Mr. Pennyworth,
I'm Martha Kane.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.057
How can I help you, Miss Kane?

00:14.101 --> 00:15.406
MARTHA:
I need a driver-bodyguard.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.104
Your advertisement says
"ex-military."

00:18.279 --> 00:20.324
10,000 quid.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.674
And she's got plenty
more work for us.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.111
What's the bad news?

00:24.154 --> 00:25.329
ALFRED:
She's a No-Name.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.766
ESME: I dreamt about Sykes all night.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.072
I dreamt that she was waiting

00:29.116 --> 00:30.943
for me at my bus stop
on Goodge Street.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.951
She thinks you're dead.That's romantic, isn't it?

00:38.995 --> 00:40.388
Coming back to life.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.085
ALFRED:
Now you're doing well enough,

00:42.129 --> 00:43.826
you'll be thinking
you're good enough for Esme.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.088
Is that right?

00:45.132 --> 00:46.307
"East is East,
and West is West,

00:46.350 --> 00:47.351
and ne'er the twain..."

00:47.395 --> 00:48.831
ALFRED:
I'm very much in love

00:48.874 --> 00:50.050
with Esme, sir.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.225
That's why I'm here--

00:51.268 --> 00:53.096
to request your permission
to marry her.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.620
I will disinherit her.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.318
Do you understand?Yes.

00:57.361 --> 01:00.408
Yes, I will.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.714
HARWOOD:
Tell the prime minister

01:02.758 --> 01:04.803
I have seen
his last days coming.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.066
For every ounce

01:06.109 --> 01:08.024
of blood I spill, he will pay.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.114
The nation will rise
in my name, and he will die.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.878
Don't worry.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.488
It'll be fine.

01:39.621 --> 01:40.970
Come on.

01:54.331 --> 01:57.334
I'm-I'm sorry to bother you.
I beg your pardon.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.293
MAN: How dare you!Please, I'm so sorry
to bother you.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.903
Get your bloody hands
off me.
Sir, madam.

02:00.946 --> 02:03.210
You dirty, bloody tramp!

02:03.253 --> 02:06.038
Come on, let's go.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.927
Hello, mate.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.059
Rough day?

02:28.191 --> 02:29.714
Oh, you're...

02:29.758 --> 02:31.760
you're a handsome old cove,
aren't you?

02:31.803 --> 02:33.675
You-you could
strike pity

02:33.718 --> 02:34.937
in a stone, you would.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.286
What's your name?

02:36.330 --> 02:39.202
No, no, no. No.
Don't worry, my dear.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.597
You've met a fellow Christian.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.469
Huh?You fancy a cup of tea
and a sandwich?

02:45.513 --> 02:47.210
Yeah?

02:47.254 --> 02:50.126
Yeah, yeah,
course you do.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.302
Come along with me.
Yeah?

02:52.346 --> 02:53.956
Here.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.218
You'll be as spry
as a lurcher.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.611
Yeah?

02:56.654 --> 02:57.960
All right, come on.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.962
Nice and slow.
That's it, that's it.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.703
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

03:58.412 --> 04:01.284

04:01.328 --> 04:03.243

You've got

You've disappointed me.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.439
I thought
you'd talk to me

04:25.482 --> 04:27.484
before making
any rash decisions.

04:27.528 --> 04:28.920
Rash? Me?

04:28.964 --> 04:30.748
Stroll on.

04:30.792 --> 04:34.491
Working for a gang of violent
subversive fanatics isn't rash?

04:34.535 --> 04:36.928
What fanatics are these?

04:36.972 --> 04:38.756
You work for Martha Kane

04:38.800 --> 04:40.236
who works for Thomas Wayne

04:40.280 --> 04:41.933
who works
for the No-Name League.

04:41.977 --> 04:44.327
First I'm hearing of it.

04:44.371 --> 04:47.287
I could arrest you here and now
and see you hang by the weekend.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.940
You could.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.595
I hope you're about to tell me
why you won't.

04:53.118 --> 04:55.338
You're a prize, Alfred.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.384
Mark my words,

04:57.427 --> 04:59.647
civil war is coming.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.605
Look around you.

05:01.649 --> 05:04.956
How many of these people
understand war?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.872
How many of them
could command men in battle?

05:07.916 --> 05:09.309
Well, that dancer there

05:09.352 --> 05:11.876
could invade Russia
all on her own.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.530
Me,

05:13.574 --> 05:16.490
I'm not gonna command anybody,
in any battle, anywhere.

05:16.533 --> 05:19.362
Everyone will have to
pick a side. That's the rules.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.495
Not me.

05:23.279 --> 05:26.195
I'm told Her Majesty
was quite struck by you.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.589
She thought you... dashing.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.112
Really?

05:30.155 --> 05:32.201
Tell her I
fancied her, too.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.594
Respectfully and that.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.945
If not for her soft heart,

05:36.988 --> 05:39.382
you, Mr. Bashford
and Mr. MacDougal

05:39.426 --> 05:41.210
would already be
in shackles.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.518
They're not in this.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.171
You'd all be
much safer

05:46.215 --> 05:47.608
if you worked for your queen.

05:47.651 --> 05:50.480
Mm. She don't
pay very well.

05:50.524 --> 05:53.309
Stop working against her...

05:53.353 --> 05:55.267
or you'll all hang.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.662
Message received.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.058
Oh.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.668
By the by,

06:04.712 --> 06:06.191
how goes Esme?

06:06.235 --> 06:07.802
Thriving, I trust?

06:07.845 --> 06:10.195
She is.

06:10.239 --> 06:13.416
What does she think about
your work for the No-Names?

06:13.460 --> 06:14.983
Why do you ask?

06:16.114 --> 06:17.638
Curiosity.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.467
The policeman's vice.

06:20.510 --> 06:21.946
Cheerio.

06:41.009 --> 06:43.011
Oh, fuck.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.154
Is Mrs. Blake at home?

06:56.198 --> 06:59.201
I'm sorry, Mrs. Blake moved
to the West Indies last year.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.770
Jamaica?No, Trinidad.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.728
I have her new address
somewhere.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.609
Good to meet you.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.741
Thomas Wayne.Martha Kane.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.876
I've heard a great deal
about you, Miss Kane.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.487
You're very well regarded
in the organization.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.098
A little mysterious, but, uh...

07:27.142 --> 07:29.100
Why is a nice American
society girl like you

07:29.144 --> 07:31.233
mixed up with
the No-Name League?

07:31.276 --> 07:32.800
Fighting somebody else's
dirty war.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.410
I could ask the same of you.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.412
Me?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.631
It's complicated.

07:37.674 --> 07:38.806
Me?

07:38.849 --> 07:41.025
Simple: I get
bored easily.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.592
I like excitement.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.464
Oh, really?

07:44.507 --> 07:46.378
An adventuress.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.642
You strike me more
as the idealistic type.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.470
Do I?

07:50.513 --> 07:52.776
Well, a person can be both,
I suppose.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.301
So, you're a Duke girl, huh?

07:56.345 --> 07:57.781
Go, Demons.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.653
Devils.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.524
You?Gotham.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.700
I've never been.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.268
Is it as scary as people say?

08:07.530 --> 08:08.662
Perfectly safe
and getting safer.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.054
In 20 years,
Gotham will be

08:10.098 --> 08:11.273
the Zurich
of the Eastern Seaboard.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.537
Now...

08:14.581 --> 08:16.583
the leadership
of the Raven Society

08:16.626 --> 08:18.628
keep their identities
a secret.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.065
They've recently elected
a new chief.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.415
We need to know who that is.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.330
There's a fellow
inside the Raven Society

08:25.374 --> 08:27.855
who will tell us the new
leader's identity for a price.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.945
You and Pennyworth are
to meet with this chap.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.513
Details...

08:33.556 --> 08:35.297
of your rendezvous...

08:35.340 --> 08:37.342
and funds...

08:37.386 --> 08:40.128
to be used
at your discretion.

08:40.171 --> 08:43.653
And I will need you to sign...

08:43.697 --> 08:45.742
for these.

08:49.311 --> 08:52.575
The deal I made with
Pennyworth stipulated no guns.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.229
And that was
the right deal to make.

08:54.272 --> 08:57.188
Now... we reel him in.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.453
If he balks...

09:01.497 --> 09:02.585
offer him more money.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.717
Whatever it takes.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.415
He's worth it.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.549
Or at least the League
thinks he is.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.994
Street fighting
between left- and right-wing

09:20.037 --> 09:24.085
criminal gangs
has resulted in three deaths

09:24.128 --> 09:25.608
and numerous injuries.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.524
The police say
the outlawed organizations

09:28.568 --> 09:32.006
known as the Raven Society
and the No-Name League

09:32.049 --> 09:33.660
are to blame for the violence.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.618
Hang 'em all, I say.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.925
Blackshirts, Redshirts,

09:37.968 --> 09:39.187
they're all the bloody same.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.711
Potless dossers.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.061
That tasty Sherman
just walked in.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.591
Hi.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.549
Miss Kane. Hello.

09:55.203 --> 09:56.944
Cola, please.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.076
Cola for the lady.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.341
How are things with you?

10:03.385 --> 10:05.648
So-so. You, Miss Kane?

10:05.692 --> 10:08.085
Fine. I have a job for you.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.958
Sorry. I can't work
for you anymore.Why not?

10:11.001 --> 10:12.960
I'm getting married.Mm. Congratulations.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.831
How does that affect
our arrangement?

10:14.875 --> 10:16.398
I've got to be safety-minded.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.834
Married men can't mess about.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.270
Hmm.

10:19.314 --> 10:21.229
But they do.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.842
That's a lot of money.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.888
Marriage is expensive.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.716
We'll manage.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.678
It's too late
to back out now.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.462
You're in too deep.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.335
I'm impressed.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.163
You went straight
for my throat,

10:42.206 --> 10:43.904
no messing about.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.732
Thank you.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.734
Thing is, Miss Kane,

10:47.777 --> 10:50.693
I lied about my reason
for quitting.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.087
The police already gave me
a nudge about you.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.698
It's too late to tell me
it's too late.

10:55.742 --> 10:58.701
Oh.
You told me you
didn't know Thomas Wayne,

10:58.745 --> 11:00.616
but he's your boss.He isn't.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.140
I mean, he wasn't.
He is now.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.490
I didn't know him then.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.188
The police know that?

11:07.231 --> 11:09.103
Good thing for you
you're American.

11:09.146 --> 11:12.802
You can scarper.
Sharpish if I were you.

11:12.846 --> 11:16.066
This job I'm talking about has
no government angle at all.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.633
The police won't object.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.243
In fact, they'll
probably approve.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.550
I said, good thing
you're American.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.770
You can scarper.
Sharpish if I were y...

11:23.813 --> 11:26.120
I heard you.
That's not happening.Miss Kane...

11:26.163 --> 11:27.730
Martha. Hmm.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.472
I need your
help, Alfred.
Martha.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.694
My old sergeant had five rules
for staying alive.

11:34.737 --> 11:38.001
Rule number one:
don't be a hero.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.134
Rule number two:
avoid heroes.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.136
I'm no hero.They all say that.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.921
Have you ever tried
a Scotch egg?No. Think about the money.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.880
Rule number three:
don't think about the money.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.186
You're making
these rules up.Good sense is good sense.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.886
Tell you what. We're
trying to get the name

11:52.929 --> 11:54.626
of the new Raven
Society leader.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.368
If we succeed,

11:57.412 --> 11:59.327
I'll pay you
double that.

11:59.370 --> 12:00.981
Cash on the nail.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.809
One job.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.462
Now I'm scared.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.726
Because you know you're
going to say yes.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.774
It's an egg inside a sausage

12:11.818 --> 12:13.471
inside bread crumbs.

12:14.951 --> 12:17.301
I don't know how they do it.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.231
Hello, Ez.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.628
Now, first thing--

12:39.671 --> 12:41.761
slowly... put the gun down

12:41.804 --> 12:44.024
on that little table
just there.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.202
Go on.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.685
Right.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.775
Come here.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.126
I'm sorry.

12:59.169 --> 13:01.128
I've turned into
such a measly coward.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.694
You can't say that.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.175
I've seen you in action.
You're a she-wolf, Ez.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.356
Gordon Bennett.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.097
Didn't I say use this
only in the last resort?

13:14.141 --> 13:15.751
It was the last resort.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.144
Who's-who's Gordon Bennett?

13:17.187 --> 13:19.015
Never mind him.
You could've killed me.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.670
I heard a noise.

13:21.713 --> 13:24.107
It was like someone
was listening outside the door.

13:24.151 --> 13:25.935
Well, what sort of
noise did you hear?

13:25.979 --> 13:27.545
Footsteps? Voices?No.

13:27.589 --> 13:30.200
It wasn't so much of a noise
as a huge, terrible silence,

13:30.244 --> 13:32.812
as if someone was standing
outside the door just breathing.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.771
I know that feeling.
It's scary.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.817
Yes.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.514
But it's your imagination.

13:39.557 --> 13:42.386
I know. I know.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.390
Here, sit down.

13:48.436 --> 13:51.134
Now, I'm thinking, Ez...

13:51.178 --> 13:53.920
I've got a big job on
soon, long hours.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.922
I don't want you worried.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.011
Why don't you stay
with Mum and Dad?

13:58.054 --> 14:00.883
Aren't you on non-speakers
with your father?

14:00.927 --> 14:02.406
Wouldn't that be awkward?

14:02.450 --> 14:04.844
Well, you can be
my flag of truce.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.194
And Mum'll be
happy as a clam.Really?

14:07.237 --> 14:09.109
She'll be showing you off
to the neighbors

14:09.152 --> 14:10.153
like you're color telly.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.515
I told you, I've got
a client next door.

14:24.559 --> 14:27.040
Turn that rubbish down.I turned it down.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.432
Yeah, and then you turned it
back up again,

14:28.476 --> 14:29.564
didn't you?
Give it here.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.131
♪ Stop and look me over...

14:32.567 --> 14:34.221
I'm not gonna chase you.

14:34.264 --> 14:36.005
I'm not gonna
get angry.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.008
So don't try and make me.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.102

That's because you won't
be a grown-up, and, uh...

14:53.066 --> 14:54.937

just don't interfere

14:54.981 --> 14:57.331

14:59.811 --> 15:01.857
Bloody cheek.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.729

15:04.773 --> 15:07.602

15:07.645 --> 15:10.083
And here's me,

15:10.126 --> 15:11.388
fresh from the bastard gallows.

15:11.432 --> 15:12.868

15:14.609 --> 15:16.263
You did, you daft bitch.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.178

16:34.080 --> 16:37.039

16:39.607 --> 16:41.304
That damp stain there...

16:41.348 --> 16:43.480
Mm-hmm....is called Bodger.

16:44.873 --> 16:47.397
That's Aunt Madge
chasing a giraffe.

16:47.441 --> 16:48.833
Mm-hmm.

16:48.877 --> 16:50.487
And that one...

16:50.531 --> 16:51.880
well...

16:51.923 --> 16:54.230
I couldn't tell
you what that is.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.582
Oh.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.541
I say.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.428
Don't you say a word.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.257
I won't.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.824
Or you.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.174
Take that wistful look
off your gob.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.438
Shut up.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.756
Morning, Mr. P.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.062
He's trying
to make sandals.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.802
I, uh...

17:44.846 --> 17:47.022
I hope the accommodations
weren't too humble

17:47.066 --> 17:48.110
for you, Esme.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.590
No, it was jolly cozy.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.896
Ah. I think this is the
first time we've had

17:51.940 --> 17:54.682
a young, unmarried
female stay the night.

17:54.725 --> 17:57.206
An auspicious
occasion.Don't start.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.556
I'm telling you,
don't start.I think

17:59.600 --> 18:01.341
this calls for the,
uh, good china.

18:01.384 --> 18:02.907
Good morning, Esme.Morning.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.431
He thinks he's being funny.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.433
Breakfast is ready
as soon as his nibs

18:06.476 --> 18:09.044
has watched the news.Not for me, Mum.
Job on.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.872
Dad, be nice to Esme.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.395
I'll be back tonight,

18:12.439 --> 18:14.267
or tomorrow early, maybe.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.443
You got a
clean hanky?

18:16.486 --> 18:17.574
Yeah, I do.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.054
Will you call me?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.708
Haven't got rehearsal,
so I'll be here all day.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.231
I'll try.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.107
MAN :
The foundation and the love

18:28.150 --> 18:31.153
that is Jesus Christ,
our Savior.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.155
The sin of the world...

18:38.987 --> 18:42.077
He'll be carrying a
dozen white roses.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.210
I don't mean to pry,
Miss Kane,

18:44.253 --> 18:47.256
but does that gun in your bag
have a round chambered?

18:47.300 --> 18:48.823
The safety's on.

18:48.866 --> 18:50.520
I had a mate called Robbo.

18:50.564 --> 18:53.219
Everybody has a good laugh
when his name comes up,

18:53.262 --> 18:56.396
'cause his last words were:
"The safety's on."

18:56.439 --> 18:58.180
I take your point.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.923
Over there.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.367
Wake up, mate.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.500
You'll miss
your train.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.025
Bollocks.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.028
The darkness.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.943
The darkness. The darkness.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.336
Hold on.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.033
You're gonna be
all right.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.991
Hold on.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.778
Oh, my God.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.475
There you go.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.216
Go on, sleep it off.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.913
We've all been there.

19:35.957 --> 19:38.002
Come on.

19:38.046 --> 19:40.135
What now, miss?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.224
I'm trying to work that out.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.531
Who did him in,
do you think?He was gonna take us

19:44.574 --> 19:47.186
to the new leader
of the Raven Society.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.362
So the Ravens were
ahead of you.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.190
What's in his wallet?

19:59.720 --> 20:01.417
MARTHA:
Huh.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.063
Well, that was shit.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.900
I'm afraid this will
be a goose chase.

20:49.944 --> 20:52.555
To be frank, I have no idea
where to start looking.

20:52.599 --> 20:55.863
Well, we won't need to look;
they'll be out looking for us.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.430
Right.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.083
Well, I guess that's so.

20:59.127 --> 21:01.608
Then we'll catch one
and persuade him to cooperate.

21:02.739 --> 21:04.088
That simple.

21:04.132 --> 21:06.352
What if they catch us?Well, then I expect

21:06.395 --> 21:09.050
they'll take us to their leader,
won't they? We can't lose.

21:10.617 --> 21:13.228
You're, uh, taking the
piss now, aren't you?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.664
Taking the mickey, miss.

21:14.708 --> 21:16.797
I wouldn't take the piss
of a client.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.973
I like to know
the local customs.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.497
Where I'm from, it's
considered rude to mock people.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.761
Where are you from,
if you don't mind me asking?

21:24.805 --> 21:27.024
Long story.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.374
Right.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.332
Your dad was a soldier.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.638
A lifer.

21:31.681 --> 21:34.118
Never understood those blokes.

21:34.162 --> 21:36.730
Ten years was
more than enough for me.

21:38.601 --> 21:41.865
I think if you stay in too long,
you start to lose yourself.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.091
This is us.

22:12.026 --> 22:13.810
Where are you off to?

22:13.854 --> 22:15.377
What do you care?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.118
Oh, don't be like that.

22:17.161 --> 22:19.381
I care a lot.
You know I do.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.644
Handsome is as handsome
does, isn't she?

22:21.688 --> 22:23.646
I know when
I'm not wanted.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.082
Where are you going?

22:25.126 --> 22:27.258
I'm off to London, and
I'm not coming back.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.390
So goodbye.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.261
London? Don't be daft.

22:30.305 --> 22:32.873
Come on, Bet.
We're sisters, eh? Bet?

22:42.099 --> 22:44.363
Do you like marmalade, Esme?

22:44.406 --> 22:46.539
Mmm. I do.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.541
It's scrumptious.

22:48.584 --> 22:51.587
I expect you, uh...
I expect

22:51.631 --> 22:53.546
you think the Scots
invented marmalade.

22:53.589 --> 22:56.070
I've heard that's the case.

22:56.113 --> 22:58.333
Rubbish.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.118
Marmalade is Portuguese.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.424
ESME:
Oh.

23:02.468 --> 23:03.904
MR. PENNYWORTH:
I ask you,

23:03.947 --> 23:06.428
oranges don't grow in Scotland,
now, do they?

23:06.472 --> 23:08.778
I should think not.

23:08.822 --> 23:11.215
And in Lisbon...

23:11.259 --> 23:15.219
what do you suppose
they call a large iron pot?

23:15.263 --> 23:18.135
I don't know.

23:18.179 --> 23:20.355
In Lisbon, Esme,
they call

23:20.399 --> 23:22.226
a large iron pot...

23:22.270 --> 23:23.619
a marmalado.

23:28.015 --> 23:29.451
No.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.627
I rest my case.

23:33.499 --> 23:36.806
Stunning you with his
Portuguese marmalade, is he?

23:36.850 --> 23:39.113
I'm sure Mr. P is right.

23:39.156 --> 23:40.723
Some, uh, kidneys, Esme?

23:41.811 --> 23:43.160
Um...

23:43.204 --> 23:44.510
Don't, Esme, love.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.860
No one likes 'em, except Mr. P.

23:46.903 --> 23:50.080
I've cooked a million, and
they're wrong'uns every time.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.126
I disagree.

23:52.169 --> 23:53.910
They're just right.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.934
What's that?

24:17.978 --> 24:21.198
ALFRED:
A maypole.What's it for?

24:21.242 --> 24:24.463
Wouldn't like to say,
miss, to a lady.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.465
Pretend I'm not a lady.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.293
It's for sex
orgies, miss.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.295
You're kidding me.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.776
Very set in their ways,
these country people.

24:38.825 --> 24:41.262
Hey, would you
look at that?

24:41.305 --> 24:43.394
MARTHA:
"The Darkness Tea Rooms."

24:43.438 --> 24:45.875
Hmm.

24:58.801 --> 25:00.324
Morning, all.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.590
Welcome.

25:04.633 --> 25:05.939
Please take a seat.

25:21.084 --> 25:23.304
What can I get you?

25:23.347 --> 25:25.567
Lovely little place
you have here.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.482
We like to think so, sir.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.616
Odd name.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.095
The Darkness Tea Rooms.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.793
Dark-Ness. It's my name.

25:33.836 --> 25:36.012
Ah, of course.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.058
We will have...

25:38.101 --> 25:39.625
a pot of Darjeeling.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.104
And, um, should we have
crumpets?

25:41.148 --> 25:43.585
Sure.Let's have crumpets.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.326
Darjeeling and crumpets.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.110
I bring up the name...

25:47.154 --> 25:50.070
Mrs. Dark-Ness,
because there's

25:50.113 --> 25:51.854
a sad story goes with it.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.160
We were supposed

25:53.203 --> 25:54.944
to meet a man
this morning

25:54.988 --> 25:56.424
at Paddington Station.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.774
Only when we met him,
he'd been stabbed.

25:58.818 --> 26:02.561
He died, right there
in front of us.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.693
And he only said one thing
before he went.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.565
"The darkness,"

26:06.608 --> 26:08.784
he said.

26:08.828 --> 26:10.569
"The darkness."

26:10.612 --> 26:11.744
Isn't that
a strange coincidence?

26:15.878 --> 26:17.837
I'll get your tea.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.360
Hmm.

26:20.491 --> 26:21.928
Hmm.

26:21.971 --> 26:23.669
That was very direct.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.192
Best way usually, miss.

26:25.235 --> 26:27.586
Please call me Martha.
I hate "miss."

26:27.629 --> 26:29.631
Yes, miss. Martha it is.

26:30.719 --> 26:31.894
Now what?

26:31.938 --> 26:33.200
Their move.

26:33.243 --> 26:34.854
But so when the shit
hits the fan,

26:34.897 --> 26:36.377
what should I do?

26:36.420 --> 26:38.031
Switch off the
fan, I suppose.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.815
Or stand behind
something shit-proof.

26:39.859 --> 26:42.470
I completed
the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve

26:42.513 --> 26:44.603
Combat Training program
at Fort Benning.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.169
I can handle myself.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.867
You leave the rough
stuff to me--

26:47.910 --> 26:49.956
if it occurs, which it
might not. Hopefully.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.185
Thank you.

27:08.148 --> 27:11.064
Should we drink that?
I mean, she could have put

27:11.107 --> 27:12.543
knockout drops in it
or something.

27:12.587 --> 27:14.154
Poison the tea?

27:14.197 --> 27:15.546
Never.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.331
The Raven Society
might be a bad lot,

27:17.374 --> 27:18.506
but they're not
bloody Italians.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.117
I expect her boss

27:21.161 --> 27:22.945
will find his boss,
and then they'll send

27:22.989 --> 27:25.600
a few gunmen
to fetch us.
A few?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.689
We only need one.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.873
Hmm.

27:39.919 --> 27:41.529
So, you're getting married.

27:41.572 --> 27:42.835
Who's the lucky woman?

27:44.184 --> 27:46.229
I'm not sure how
lucky she is.

27:46.273 --> 27:48.275
Sorry. Is that
a rude question?

27:50.712 --> 27:53.541
She doesn't know I'm mixed up
with all this sort of carry-on.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.500
So, you know. Bring
her up and I wobble.

27:56.544 --> 27:57.719
I understand.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.070
Esme. The name's Esme.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.681
She's an actress.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.291
An actor.Mm.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.728
Have you got a picture?

28:06.772 --> 28:08.077
Yeah.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.302
Hmm.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.695
Oh.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.740
Oh, she looks kind,

28:18.784 --> 28:19.915
gentle.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.657
Yeah.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.050
I don't deserve her.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.052
I expect she feels
the same way.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.314
Vice versa, I mean.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.794
Nah.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.186
Women don't think
like that, do they?

28:30.230 --> 28:31.753
Oh.

28:31.797 --> 28:32.754
Don't we?

28:32.798 --> 28:34.408
Ah, a woman knows her worth.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.671
I mean, they do.
You do, don't you?

28:36.715 --> 28:38.455
A man has to find out.

28:38.499 --> 28:40.283
Wow.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.590
You're a genuine
old-fashioned sexist.

28:42.633 --> 28:45.506
I'm not sure what
a sexist is, miss.

28:45.549 --> 28:47.595
But if they're what they
sound like, I'm not one.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.466
Strictly a one-woman
man, I am.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.686
What?

28:55.821 --> 28:58.084
She's a lucky woman.

29:02.653 --> 29:04.873
You've made me feel guilty now.

29:11.358 --> 29:14.883
Ah. This, uh, was
a 50-place service

29:14.927 --> 29:17.233
in honor
of His Grace Baron Rutland,

29:17.277 --> 29:19.758
on the occasion
of his 60th birthday.

29:19.801 --> 29:22.586
It's a gorgeous table.

29:22.630 --> 29:25.502
Mm.It's formal and yet
lyrical somehow.

29:25.546 --> 29:27.504
Oh.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.245
Thank you, Esme.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.334
Yes, I was, um...

29:31.378 --> 29:33.815
I was quite satisfied
with that one.

29:35.599 --> 29:38.733
Ah. Yes,
this was a-a less

29:38.777 --> 29:40.604
formal table
for the French ambassador.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.911
Mr. P,

29:42.955 --> 29:45.566
this might be frightfully
boring for you,

29:45.609 --> 29:47.002
and you have to say no

29:47.046 --> 29:48.917
if you'd prefer
not to, but...Mm.

29:48.961 --> 29:52.660
would you consider helping
me to plan our wedding?

29:52.703 --> 29:56.229
It's just that I do so want
a day to make Alfie proud.

29:56.272 --> 29:59.188
And, to be honest with you,
it's all quite daunting.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.668
And you have such a gift.

30:04.585 --> 30:08.023
I-I'd be, um...

30:08.067 --> 30:11.026
I'd be happy and honored
to assist you, Esme.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.771
Mother!

30:16.815 --> 30:19.252
Telephone!

30:19.295 --> 30:22.124
Right, I've got ears.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.781
Hello?

30:26.825 --> 30:28.609
Hello, Mum. Can't chat.

30:28.652 --> 30:31.046
Is Esme there?Oh, hello, love.

30:31.090 --> 30:32.047
How are you?

30:32.091 --> 30:33.875
You sound ever so close.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.051
Where are you?
Did you take your mac?

30:36.095 --> 30:37.879
'Cause it looks like rain again.Mum.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.142
All right.
Yes, sir, Mr. Bossy Boots.

30:40.186 --> 30:41.187
Right away.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.885
On the job, he says.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.104
Only got a minute.

30:45.147 --> 30:47.846
No time to waste
on his mum.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.152
Hello, darling.

30:50.196 --> 30:52.415
Hello, Ez. Just checking in.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.417
Thank you.
How's the job?

30:54.461 --> 30:56.376
Oh, you know. The usual.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.813
Everybody still friendly,
I hope?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.641
Yeah, we're having
a lovely time.

31:00.684 --> 31:02.730
Your dad's just a big
teddy bear, really, isn't he?

31:02.773 --> 31:04.906
A teddy bear?
You in the right house?

31:04.950 --> 31:08.083
Oh, ha-ha. Oh, oh,
do you have a shade of white

31:08.127 --> 31:09.432
that you particularly like?

31:09.476 --> 31:11.434
A shade of white? No.

31:11.478 --> 31:14.089
Yes, I'm going to the flat today
to look at colors.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.309
Oh, are you? All right.

31:16.352 --> 31:17.658
That's good. Colors are good.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.312
Listen, I've got to go.

31:19.355 --> 31:20.704
On the job.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.532
When are you--
when are you back?

31:22.576 --> 31:25.274
Hard to tell.
Look, stay at Mum's.

31:25.318 --> 31:27.015
Love you.

31:51.692 --> 31:54.825
Esme, do tell him when
you've seen enough.

31:54.869 --> 31:57.132
Mr. P said he'd help us
with the wedding plans.

31:58.264 --> 31:59.308
Oh, did he?

32:00.788 --> 32:03.138
That's very nice,
I'm sure.

32:03.182 --> 32:05.227
Don't sulk!

32:05.271 --> 32:06.925
You can help, too!

32:06.968 --> 32:08.970
Crikey, I've upset her now,
haven't I?

32:09.014 --> 32:10.058
Come on out
of there, you!

32:14.193 --> 32:16.891
Don't use that tone of voice
with me, thank you.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.025
And I wasn't sulking.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.287
I'm so sorry, Mother.

32:21.330 --> 32:22.505
I should have asked
you first, of course.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.682
Will you help as well?

32:25.726 --> 32:26.727
Please?

32:43.396 --> 32:46.094
I feel like I've got
her on my clothes...

32:46.138 --> 32:48.096
and in my hair.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.243
Oh, Jesus.This way.

34:28.892 --> 34:30.894
It's okay.

34:50.610 --> 34:51.437
Fuck off.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.842
Shit.

35:32.347 --> 35:34.523
You're all right.

35:36.569 --> 35:38.527
A few stitches.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.529
We'll find
a doctor...

35:40.573 --> 35:42.183
and we'll get
you home.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.151
Fuck!

35:53.194 --> 35:55.457
Hey, we're alive
and walking about.

35:55.501 --> 35:57.067
That's a result.

35:57.111 --> 35:59.809
Mm, this whole operation's
been a horrible failure.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.291
The League will likely
throw me out.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.163
In the real Army,

36:05.206 --> 36:06.555
you can fail as
much as you like--

36:06.599 --> 36:07.948
they'll never throw you out.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.211
There'd be nobody left.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.778
But that is the real Army.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.997
The No-Name League
is not just a pretend army.

36:14.041 --> 36:16.304
It's not just soldiers
who can fight.

36:18.350 --> 36:20.700
Never mind fighting.
Can you walk?

36:20.743 --> 36:22.441
Of course I can.

36:22.484 --> 36:23.964
You need to find
yourself a doctor.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.531
I saw a hospital
near town.

36:25.574 --> 36:26.793
I'll deal with
this other mob.

36:27.837 --> 36:30.144
Now let's go.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.891
Which way?

36:46.987 --> 36:48.945
Hello. What seems
to be the trouble?

36:48.989 --> 36:49.946
My leg.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.470
Oh, yes.

36:51.513 --> 36:54.255
Dear me. I'll have
to call the doctor.

36:54.299 --> 36:57.432
If you'll come this way,
please, minding the carpet.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.094
How do you do, young lady?

37:07.137 --> 37:09.009
Frances Gaunt.Margo.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.315
Margo Keen.

37:10.358 --> 37:12.142
Ah.

37:12.186 --> 37:15.276
So, what happened, Miss Keen?

37:15.320 --> 37:18.279
Well, I'm afraid I walked
through a glass door.

37:18.323 --> 37:19.976
A glass door?
: How bizarre.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.891
Why would anyone have
a glass door?

37:21.935 --> 37:25.895
Uh, well, it was more of a
French window sort of thing.

37:25.939 --> 37:28.550
French window.
For God's sake. How absurd.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.552
I want a door
or I want a window,

37:30.596 --> 37:31.988
not a half-baked compromise.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.950
Now let me see.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.003
Is it bad?

37:47.047 --> 37:48.483
No.

37:48.527 --> 37:49.832
Not really.

37:49.876 --> 37:51.007
Eight or nine stitches.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.883
Now, this is
an anesthetic

37:56.926 --> 37:58.972
to dull the pain
while I'm stitching.

37:59.015 --> 38:01.670
You'll feel a not
unpleasant wooziness.

38:06.414 --> 38:08.286
There we are. Good girl.

38:10.723 --> 38:13.334
Will there be a scar?

38:13.378 --> 38:14.553
A little one, maybe.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.296
Adds character.

38:18.339 --> 38:21.168
But I don't want a scar.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.433
My mom had a scar...

38:27.392 --> 38:29.350
...where she...

38:29.394 --> 38:31.134
Scar...

38:32.397 --> 38:33.702
Nurse Dawson!

38:36.096 --> 38:37.793
Fair cop.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.622
I'm tired of running.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.276
Hey. Steady on!

38:42.320 --> 38:43.669
There's no need for that!

38:43.712 --> 38:45.584
You caught me!
You're bloody heroes!

38:45.627 --> 38:47.281
Fuck's sake!

38:47.325 --> 38:48.674
Calm yourself!

38:53.374 --> 38:55.333
You calm yourself.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.465
That's
for Mrs. Darkness,

38:57.509 --> 38:59.293
you callous murdering bastard.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.034
Yeah, I'm very sorry about her.

39:01.077 --> 39:03.384
It was unfortunate.

39:03.428 --> 39:06.561
Now, listen, you need to take me
to the guv'nor of your mob.

39:06.605 --> 39:07.562
I have a message for him.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.391
Here's a message.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.785
You better stop
that right now, mate.

39:12.828 --> 39:15.135
Fuck off. Stop what?

39:15.178 --> 39:17.703
You fucking done an old woman
for no fucking reason,

39:17.746 --> 39:19.269
you filth.

39:19.313 --> 39:21.271
How about we go
and shoot your mum in the face?

39:21.315 --> 39:23.099
Now, that's enough.

39:23.143 --> 39:24.318
Or what?

39:26.451 --> 39:28.366
For fuck's sake!

39:28.409 --> 39:31.107
I'm trying to do business here,
like we're professionals.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.848
Do you understand
me? Business.

39:32.892 --> 39:35.329
Now stop fucking about and
take me to your guv'nor.

39:42.118 --> 39:44.338
Snared, eh?

39:44.382 --> 39:48.342
The ruthless hunter
killer at bay.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.998
We're gonna roast you alive
on a bonfire, old chap.

39:52.041 --> 39:54.174
Cheer up the troops?
That sort of thing?

39:54.217 --> 39:55.480
Yes.

39:55.523 --> 39:57.264
You have
a message?

39:57.307 --> 40:00.267
You are Raven Society,
aren't you?

40:00.310 --> 40:02.269
Not some other similar
jackboot mob?

40:02.312 --> 40:03.836
There's a lot of you about
these days.

40:05.098 --> 40:07.405
We are the Raven
Society, yes.

40:07.448 --> 40:08.971
Then, yes,

40:09.015 --> 40:11.409
I have an important message
for your guv'nor.

40:11.452 --> 40:12.975
From the No-Name League.

40:13.019 --> 40:14.716
Go on.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.675
Are you the guv'nor, sir?

40:16.718 --> 40:17.850
For your
purposes, yes.

40:17.893 --> 40:18.851
Yeah, no.

40:18.894 --> 40:20.592
I need to see the real guv'nor.

40:20.635 --> 40:23.682
The real guv'nor doesn't
see the likes of you.

40:23.725 --> 40:27.207
Then the real guv'nor
doesn't get the message.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.817
Not being difficult, sir.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.254
Just following orders.

40:48.576 --> 40:51.057
Don't stand up yet, my dear.
You'll be very dizzy.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.537
Uh, what happened?

40:52.580 --> 40:55.061
You fainted.
Blood loss. All's well.

40:55.104 --> 40:58.456
Nine stitches
and a small, charming scar.

40:58.499 --> 41:01.459
You're jolly lucky
it wasn't much worse.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.199
French windows, you say?

41:04.331 --> 41:06.507
So stupid of me.

41:06.551 --> 41:10.163
Um... my clothes?

41:10.206 --> 41:11.164
In the laundry.

41:11.207 --> 41:12.165
They were sordid.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.430
Tea?

41:16.474 --> 41:18.824
Earl Grey
or herbal?

41:18.867 --> 41:20.956
Yes, please. Whatever
you're having.

41:21.000 --> 41:21.827
I'm having gin.

41:23.611 --> 41:26.222
Herbal, then.

41:30.836 --> 41:32.664
Well, what's the message?

41:33.795 --> 41:35.057
You're not the man in charge.

41:35.101 --> 41:36.232
Yes, I am.

41:36.276 --> 41:38.104
How would you
know, anyway?

41:38.147 --> 41:39.497
I can see your shoes.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.849
Third-in-command
at best, sir.

41:43.892 --> 41:46.852
I need to parley
with your big chief, the leader.

41:46.895 --> 41:49.071
What's his name again?

41:49.115 --> 41:52.074
I don't think you have
a message for the leader.

41:52.118 --> 41:55.817
I think you're just delaying the
punishment that's coming to you.

41:55.861 --> 41:58.211
Maybe. Maybe not.

41:58.254 --> 42:00.474
Your call.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.216
You're very confident
for a dead man.

42:03.259 --> 42:06.001
Only a fool wouldn't kick
this ball upstairs.

42:11.659 --> 42:13.269
So glad we crossed paths.

42:13.313 --> 42:15.924
New faces are
a rare treat out here.

42:15.968 --> 42:18.536
One sees the same tedious
characters again and again.

42:18.579 --> 42:20.233
I can imagine.

42:20.276 --> 42:23.236
I've dined at
every house in the county.

42:23.279 --> 42:24.890
I've seen false lintels.

42:24.933 --> 42:26.631
Spiral stairs. Bidets.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.592
I've seen monstrous things.

42:31.636 --> 42:33.855
But I've never seen
a French window.

42:33.899 --> 42:36.379
Where were you?

42:38.164 --> 42:39.774
That's funny.

42:39.818 --> 42:41.559
Um...

42:41.602 --> 42:44.213
I must-- I must be still woozy.

42:44.257 --> 42:47.086
I forget the family's name.

42:47.129 --> 42:48.914
I hadn't met them before.
Friends of friends.

42:48.957 --> 42:50.611
Of course, you're still woozy.

42:50.655 --> 42:52.657
You need iron.
Drink your tea.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.354
Nurse Dawson!

42:55.703 --> 42:58.053
Uh, bring Tanya,
would you?

42:58.097 --> 42:59.402
MARTHA:
Um...

42:59.446 --> 43:02.275
Do you think my clothes
are dry by now?

43:02.318 --> 43:04.277
You won't be needing them.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.626
No?

43:05.670 --> 43:08.150
No, you and another
young man

43:08.194 --> 43:10.370
were sent here to
find and assassinate

43:10.413 --> 43:12.677
the leader of the
Raven Society.

43:12.720 --> 43:15.549
I can't very well
let you walk away.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.029
Excuse me?

43:17.072 --> 43:19.553
You killed poor Mrs. Darkness
for no reason

43:19.597 --> 43:22.600
and injured several good people,
and to cap it all,

43:22.643 --> 43:24.819
you came stumbling
right to my door.

43:24.863 --> 43:26.734
Amazing.

43:26.778 --> 43:28.170
What are you talking about?

43:30.346 --> 43:31.652
It's me you're looking for.

43:33.785 --> 43:35.221
I'm the new leader
of the Raven Society

43:35.264 --> 43:36.744
that you came here to kill.

43:36.788 --> 43:39.355
Um...

43:39.399 --> 43:41.314
I'm sorry, Doctor,

43:41.357 --> 43:43.533
but you've made a mistake.

43:43.577 --> 43:45.579
That or, uh,
you're mentally unwell.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.363
I don't know, b-but I'm going.

43:47.407 --> 43:49.322
Oh, don't exert yourself.
You'll faint.

43:49.365 --> 43:50.889
Bring me my clothes!

43:50.932 --> 43:51.933
Your clothes have been burnt.

43:51.977 --> 43:55.807
I didn't seek
this honor.

43:55.850 --> 44:00.246
No, but after poor
Jimmy Harwood's sad end,

44:00.289 --> 44:03.466
none of the men would step up,
so here I am, God help me.

44:03.510 --> 44:06.731
Trying to save this wretched
country from the likes of you.

44:06.774 --> 44:08.907
Me?
Soft-hearted,

44:08.950 --> 44:10.386
liberal idealist do-gooders.

44:11.866 --> 44:13.825
I guess that is me.

44:13.868 --> 44:16.741
I think you exaggerate my power.

44:16.784 --> 44:20.179
I feel jolly tempted to let you
go along your merry way.

44:20.222 --> 44:23.573
But, alas, you killed
one of our people.

44:23.617 --> 44:26.228
And a woman in charge
must not look soft.

44:26.272 --> 44:28.317
I have to set
a stern example.

44:28.361 --> 44:29.841
My colleague knows I'm here.

44:29.884 --> 44:31.930
What'll he do? Call the police?

44:31.973 --> 44:33.671
Launch an assault?

44:35.803 --> 44:37.239
What's your real name?

44:37.283 --> 44:39.981
Does it matter?Of course it does.

44:40.025 --> 44:43.028
Not to me. To you.

44:43.071 --> 44:45.595
But don't be alarmed
or squeamish.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.426
Do you know this woman?

44:50.470 --> 44:52.428
No, no, g-give her
a proper look. Do you know her?

44:54.474 --> 44:55.910
No, it's not
a trick question.

44:55.954 --> 44:57.825
We don't know her, either.

44:57.869 --> 44:59.697
We call her Tanya
because she looks Russian.

44:59.740 --> 45:02.874
Oh, now, are you sure
you don't know her?
Yes.

45:02.917 --> 45:06.660
Yeah, well, I ask everyone
if they know her.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.096
She was a brave young woman.

45:08.140 --> 45:09.402
Tried to kill me, like you.

45:09.445 --> 45:12.274
She wouldn't
tell us anything.

45:12.318 --> 45:15.060
Not even her name.
No matter what was done to her.

45:15.103 --> 45:18.977
She deserves to be buried
decently, by her own people.

45:19.020 --> 45:22.720
So I keep her like this
for now.

45:22.763 --> 45:24.765
Don't you think your family
would want to know

45:24.809 --> 45:26.027
what had happened to you?

45:28.769 --> 45:30.684
Your name.

45:43.871 --> 45:45.830
My name is Martha.

45:45.873 --> 45:47.527
Martha Kane.

45:47.570 --> 45:50.573
Pleasure to meet you, Martha.

45:50.617 --> 45:51.661
Come in.

45:53.533 --> 45:55.535
Madam Leader, forgive
the intrusion.

45:55.578 --> 45:57.058
We caught the other spy.

45:57.102 --> 45:58.973
He says he has a message
from the No-Names,

45:59.017 --> 46:00.322
for your ears only.

46:09.592 --> 46:12.073
MARTHA:
Hello, Alfred.

46:12.117 --> 46:13.683
Who's that?
Do I know you?

46:13.727 --> 46:16.034
The jig's up.
They know my name.

46:16.077 --> 46:17.687
They know everything.

46:17.731 --> 46:19.559
Oh. Okay.

46:19.602 --> 46:21.039
That's not good.

46:21.082 --> 46:22.170
You all right?

46:22.214 --> 46:23.824
Been better.

46:23.868 --> 46:25.783
Good day to you,
young man.

46:25.826 --> 46:27.393
Alfred, is it?

46:27.436 --> 46:29.699
Who are you, now?

46:29.743 --> 46:32.441
Frances Gaunt.
Leader of the Raven Society.

46:32.485 --> 46:34.835
Get out. A woman?

46:34.879 --> 46:36.663
No wonder you're a secret.

46:36.706 --> 46:38.099
Don't be an ass.

46:38.143 --> 46:40.188
Is she really the guv'nor?Seems so.

46:40.232 --> 46:43.844
Oh, well, then, excuse
my impertinence, madam.

46:43.888 --> 46:45.454
How did you get here?

46:45.498 --> 46:47.805
She's the doctor.

46:47.848 --> 46:49.850
Ah. Bollocks.

46:49.894 --> 46:51.809
So, do you have
a message for me?

46:51.852 --> 46:53.593
What?A message

46:53.636 --> 46:54.855
from the No-Name leadership.

46:54.899 --> 46:56.509
Oh, yeah. No.

46:56.552 --> 46:58.076
I made that up.
No message.

46:58.119 --> 46:59.033
You bastard.

47:00.426 --> 47:02.036
Steady on.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.603
Fair play, you wouldn't
even have me here

47:03.646 --> 47:05.300
if I hadn't let myself
get caught.

47:05.344 --> 47:07.215
Now, why would you do that?

47:07.259 --> 47:09.304
I get paid a lot more money
if we succeed.

47:09.348 --> 47:10.523
Seemed worth the risk.

47:11.916 --> 47:15.006
Now, Miss Martha,
Fort Benning now.

47:42.729 --> 47:44.383
Oh, e-excuse me,
if it's all the same to you,

47:44.426 --> 47:45.906
would you mind doing that
facing me?

47:45.950 --> 47:47.865
I like to see things clearly.

47:47.908 --> 47:50.868
God blind me, what do you
take me for? The bloody Hun?

47:50.911 --> 47:52.478
Well, you killed
Mrs. Darkness.

47:52.521 --> 47:54.132
That was an accident.

47:54.175 --> 47:55.873
I'm very sorry about that.

47:55.916 --> 47:58.223
We were told to find out
your name. That's all.

47:58.266 --> 48:01.226
We're not like you.

48:01.269 --> 48:02.618
We don't kill
and torture people.

48:02.662 --> 48:04.055
My dear,

48:04.098 --> 48:06.709
despite your courage,
you are a complete fool.

48:06.753 --> 48:09.538
Yeah, anyway...
ticktock, job done.

48:09.582 --> 48:11.192
Give us a car

48:11.236 --> 48:12.672
and a couple of bottles
of beer, and we'll be off.

48:17.851 --> 48:19.853
Today in Berlin,
Reich Chancellor Braun

48:19.897 --> 48:22.116
signed a power-sharing agreement
with the Dutch senate

48:22.160 --> 48:25.119
that will allow the Netherlands
partial autonomy

48:25.163 --> 48:27.121
within the German Reich.

48:27.165 --> 48:30.864
Chancellor Braun personally
guarantees the pact.

48:30.908 --> 48:34.737
In home news, teenage pop fans
nationwide were stunned

48:34.781 --> 48:38.785
to learn that Cliff Richard
and the Shadows are breaking up

48:38.828 --> 48:40.308
to pursue separate careers.

48:40.352 --> 48:41.831
Her Majesty's Minister
for Culture

48:41.875 --> 48:43.355
has not yet issued a state...

48:50.188 --> 48:52.799
I haven't counted it.

48:52.842 --> 48:54.279
Well, if you can't trust
loony underground radicals,

48:54.322 --> 48:56.324
who can you trust?

48:57.369 --> 48:59.327
Cheers.

48:59.371 --> 49:01.895
Cheers.

49:03.984 --> 49:06.378
Mmm.

49:08.684 --> 49:11.383
You enjoyed yourself
today, didn't you?

49:11.426 --> 49:14.386
Well, mission accomplished,
no broken bones,

49:14.429 --> 49:15.953
cash money--
that's enjoyable.

49:15.996 --> 49:17.737
I mean you enjoyed
being close to death.

49:17.780 --> 49:20.914
Death? Give over.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.003
We were close to Swindon.
That's bad enough.

49:23.047 --> 49:24.874
Everything's funny to you.

49:24.918 --> 49:26.659
It's a sort of compulsion,
isn't it?

49:29.488 --> 49:31.881
I had a mate called Spanish.

49:31.925 --> 49:34.623
He used to say life's either
a comedy or a tragedy,

49:34.667 --> 49:36.669
and you have to choose one
or the other.

49:36.712 --> 49:38.540
I prefer having a laugh.

49:41.195 --> 49:43.676
I'll drink to that.

49:43.719 --> 49:45.808
Comedy.

49:52.293 --> 49:54.992
You were very game today,
if I may say so, Miss Martha.

49:55.035 --> 49:57.995
Very game.

49:58.038 --> 50:00.606
Your bosses will be making you
a captain or something.

50:00.649 --> 50:02.521
Hmm.

50:02.564 --> 50:04.740
I doubt that.

50:04.784 --> 50:08.309
The politics of it all
are still quite... murky to me.

50:08.353 --> 50:11.356
Well, murky's not good.

50:11.399 --> 50:13.358
Why are you mucking about
with these people?

50:15.490 --> 50:16.709
It's a long story.

50:16.752 --> 50:19.059
You've got a lot
of long stories.

50:19.103 --> 50:21.366
You have to believe
in something.

50:21.409 --> 50:22.497
Do you?
Hmm.

50:22.541 --> 50:23.629
Not me.

50:23.672 --> 50:24.804
You like to say that.

50:24.847 --> 50:26.632
You know it's not true.

50:26.675 --> 50:28.851
Oh, you see right through me,
can you?

50:28.895 --> 50:30.810
No.

50:32.072 --> 50:33.943
You're quite mysterious.

50:33.987 --> 50:35.510
Hmm.

50:40.559 --> 50:42.169
You said something
that stuck with me.

50:43.736 --> 50:47.174
You said my
father was lying.

50:47.218 --> 50:51.483
You said all soldiers
have nightmares.

50:51.526 --> 50:53.224
"Lying" is the wrong word.

50:53.267 --> 50:54.877
I'm sure your dad
was an honest man.

50:56.923 --> 50:59.186
He made pancakes
with faces on them,

50:59.230 --> 51:01.493
dressed as a pirate
at Halloween.

51:02.581 --> 51:04.539
That kind of a dad.

51:04.583 --> 51:07.194
Happy. Mm-hmm.

51:07.238 --> 51:10.676
And then he died
in a car crash.

51:10.719 --> 51:12.547
And he was an
excellent driver.

51:12.591 --> 51:14.984
In my experience,

51:15.028 --> 51:17.813
it's your excellent drivers
are the ones that crash.

51:17.857 --> 51:19.119
Overconfidence.

51:25.647 --> 51:28.476
Anyway, I...

51:28.520 --> 51:29.999
I'd better be going.

51:51.891 --> 51:54.763
I'd, um...

51:54.807 --> 51:57.026
You'd better be going.

51:57.070 --> 51:58.854
Yeah.

52:03.511 --> 52:08.690
Well, it was a pleasure
working with you, Miss Kane.

52:08.734 --> 52:12.390
Best of luck subverting
the state and all that.

52:12.433 --> 52:14.653
Best of luck to you,
too, Alfred.

52:43.943 --> 52:45.901
Thank you, sir.

52:45.945 --> 52:48.556
Thank you very much.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.428
Hey, look at this.

52:50.471 --> 52:52.299
Want a biscuit, yeah?

52:52.343 --> 52:54.997
Yeah?
Call.

52:55.041 --> 52:57.130
Oh, good boy,
good boy.

52:57.174 --> 53:00.002
Yeah, that's...
yeah, yeah, good.

53:13.886 --> 53:17.455
ESME:
Alfie, I got the sudden urge
to choose paint.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.718
I'll be back by 11:00
at the latest.
