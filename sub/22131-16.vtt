LIKE OUT OF THE BLUE.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.444
NOTHING'S OUT OF THE BLUE.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.143

DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

IT'S REALLY NICE THAT YOU CARE.

14:10.893 --> 14:14.288
WHY DO YOU CARE? WE JUST MET.

14:21.121 --> 14:24.080
BECAUSE THAT LITTLE BOY WAS ME.

14:27.736 --> 14:30.304
I HAD A PAPER ROUTE
ON THE WEEKENDS,

14:30.434 --> 14:31.871
AND ON SUNDAYS
MY DAD WOULD HELP ME.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.570
WE'D GET UP REALLY EARLY,

14:35.700 --> 14:37.528
HAVE GLAZED DOUGHNUTS
FOR BREAKFAST,

AT ONE DOOR, THEN THE OTHER.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.276
IT WAS MAGICAL TO ME.

14:50.324 --> 14:54.894
THEN ONE DAY WHILE I WAS
AT SCHOOL, HE LEFT.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.506
THERE WAS NO WARNING, NOTHING.

14:58.636 --> 15:01.335
FROM THAT MOMENT,
EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE CHANGED.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.599
I HAD TO MOVE IN WITH MY AUNT,

15:04.729 --> 15:06.557

DIFFERENT SCHOOL.

15:08.342 --> 15:09.473

INTO A SEVERE DEPRESSION,

15:16.567 --> 15:17.742

15:20.745 --> 15:22.182
SHE DIED A FEW YEARS LATER.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.276
DID YOU EVER HEAR
FROM YOUR DAD AGAIN?

15:30.146 --> 15:34.194
WELL, WE GOT A COLLECT
PHONE CALL FROM HIM

15:34.324 --> 15:35.456
THE DAY OF HER FUNERAL,

15:36.631 --> 15:38.546
BUT MY AUNT
WOULDN'T ACCEPT THE CHARGES.

15:40.461 --> 15:43.377

INTO THE SHOWER,

15:43.507 --> 15:44.769

MAYBE MY DAD DIDN'T KNOW.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.739
HE KNEW, HE KNEW WHERE YOU WERE,
HE CALLED YOU.

15:59.001 --> 16:02.613
NO, WHAT I MEAN IS,
MAYBE HE DIDN'T KNOW

16:02.744 --> 16:04.659
HOW MUCH I REALLY NEEDED HIM.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.880

WHEN I WAS SAD AND LONELY,
