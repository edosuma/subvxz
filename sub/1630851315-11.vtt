What?

01:41.405 --> 01:42.972
Nothing.

01:43.015 --> 01:45.888
- I like this.
- The coffee? It's fair trade.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.716
Mm-mm. Not the coffee.

01:47.759 --> 01:50.327
Though you really can taste
the transparency in the roast.

01:51.763 --> 01:54.157
I like sitting here with you
and not talking.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.072
- Mm.
- Just being comfortable

01:56.116 --> 01:57.943
in the silence,

01:57.987 --> 02:00.685
watching you read.

02:00.729 --> 02:03.688
Your staring is...
it's a little creepy.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.301
Hey.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.217
I'm happy, too.

02:11.914 --> 02:14.308
It's great to feel
like I can just be.

02:14.351 --> 02:15.787
I've never had that.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.572
I've always felt the need
to make conversation.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.487
Oh, yeah, totally.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.621
Yeah, like even now,
I'm not remotely annoyed

02:23.665 --> 02:25.754
you're not paying attention.

02:25.797 --> 02:28.191
I know how important
your job is. I get it.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.367
And I've grown to love...

02:30.411 --> 02:31.760
like...

02:31.803 --> 02:33.457
"Distracted Whistler."

02:33.501 --> 02:35.981
Alexa, how long will it take
to get to Pearl Harbor?

02:36.025 --> 02:38.462
Based on
current traffic, it will take

02:38.506 --> 02:41.161
about 35 minutes
- to get to Pearl Harbor.
- I have to go.

02:41.204 --> 02:44.251
Oh, well, here,
I'll get you a to-go mug.

02:44.294 --> 02:47.645
And, uh, I will be sure
to return it soon.

02:47.689 --> 02:50.170
Like, uh,
maybe tonight soon?

02:50.213 --> 02:51.954
Alexa,

02:51.997 --> 02:54.261
is the Hau Tree open
for dinner tonight?

02:54.304 --> 02:58.352
Hau Tree will be open today
from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.964
Let's, uh, talk about it later.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.663
- Have a great day.
- You, too.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.497
Rowan. Miles.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.238
Harper. Holden.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.545
Kai. Dalia.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.203
Dalia?

03:23.246 --> 03:24.769
Good morning,
handsome.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.902
When I said you can't text me
during the week

03:26.945 --> 03:28.686
or after 4:00 p.m. on weekends,

03:28.730 --> 03:31.123
that also applied
to in-person visits.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.909
Relax, Malik.
I'm not here for you.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.650
She's here for me.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.739
Believe it or not, Ernie,
everything isn't about you.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.610
Jury's still out
on that.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.264
How can I help you,
Detective Reed?

03:41.308 --> 03:42.396
Trey Santos.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.614
The drug dealer?

03:43.658 --> 03:45.442
He's more of a kingpin, really.

03:45.486 --> 03:48.706
We spent six months working
with HPD on a joint task force

03:48.750 --> 03:51.274
busting him,
but this isn't about me.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.364
Trial's starting next week.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.192
There isn't gonna be a trial.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.933
Key evidence is gone.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.369
The hard drives are missing?

03:59.413 --> 04:01.284
Well, technically,
they're still there.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.852
- But wiped clean.
- My God.

04:03.895 --> 04:06.028
Everything linking
him to the operation.

04:06.071 --> 04:08.291
Schedules, routes,
encrypted financials.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.293
I knew NCIS
should have taken

04:10.337 --> 04:12.295
those hard drives
instead of the 46 kilos

04:12.339 --> 04:15.820
of untraceable cocaine we
found hidden on Navy property.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.953
This <i>is</i> kind of about me.

04:17.996 --> 04:20.129
D.A. is gonna drop charges.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.739
Santos was released yesterday.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.568
- That's not good.
- Gets worse.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.178
I think I know
who's responsible.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.790
And I need your help.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.662
Detective Roy Burr.

04:31.706 --> 04:34.970
15 years working narcotics
for HPD.

04:35.013 --> 04:37.451
History of questionable behavior.

04:37.494 --> 04:40.889
Several Internal Affairs
investigations.

04:40.932 --> 04:43.848
Any of those investigations
bring about a suspension?

04:43.892 --> 04:48.331
No. But logs show Burr was
in the evidence locker

04:48.375 --> 04:51.334
days before we learned
the hard drives were wiped.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.989
That's not exactly
a smoking gun.

04:54.032 --> 04:57.427
Up until a few years ago,
Santos was a small-time dealer

04:57.471 --> 05:00.648
who side-hustled as a
confidential informant.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.258
That's how he built his empire.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.304
Every time he helped take down
other dealers,

05:04.347 --> 05:06.349
he quietly took over
their territory.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.872
Here's the kicker.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.397
Burr was the cop
who turned Santos into a C.I.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.834
Well, there's
your smoke.

05:12.877 --> 05:16.141
If Burr turned a blind eye to
Santos's power grab back then...

05:16.185 --> 05:18.143
He could easily be
on the take now.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.710
Destroy evidence against him.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.277
Why not go to your bosses?

05:22.365 --> 05:24.585
She doesn't know
who she can trust.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.891
Kai, see what Ernie
can find on Roy Burr.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.719
Make sure he doesn't raise
any flags with HPD.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.382
Smells good in here.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.210
You light a candle
or something?

05:41.253 --> 05:43.255
You ever hear about
midnight madness?

05:43.299 --> 05:46.563
Flight Honolulu-to-Vegas,
Hawai'i's ninth island. Why?

05:46.607 --> 05:48.870
Roy Burr goes at
least once a month.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.437
Stays at the nicest suites
downtown.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.786
Likes to live large.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.136
Oh, and he's got the
debts to prove it.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.312
Lot of people have debts
and aren't on the take.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.140
- Any links to Santos?
- Nothing yet.

05:58.183 --> 05:59.402
No big cash deposits

05:59.446 --> 06:01.186
or offshore accounts.

06:01.230 --> 06:02.797
If he's bringing money
into Las Vegas,

06:02.840 --> 06:04.407
he's leaving it
at the tables.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.104
Destroying evidence
seems like a big risk

06:06.148 --> 06:08.629
to play slots
and get a comped buffet.

06:08.672 --> 06:11.109
Well, never underestimate
the mind of a gambler.

06:11.153 --> 06:13.764
Something's there.
Just haven't found it.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.157
Or Dalia's wrong.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.855
She would never come
on just a hunch.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.727
She's very good at her job.

06:19.770 --> 06:20.989
Is she, now?

06:21.032 --> 06:23.470
All right,
we'll tail Burr old-school.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.733
See what we can uncover.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.997
It's cologne.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.347
Dalia's here
and you put on cologne.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.044
No, it's essential oils.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.133
- It relaxes me.
- Okay.

06:46.841 --> 06:50.018
Dry cleaner, car wash,

06:50.061 --> 06:51.280
and now a
Chinese market.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.716
This might be
the most boring

06:52.760 --> 06:54.718
stakeout in
law enforcement history.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.416
You want to hear about
a boring stakeout?

06:56.459 --> 06:58.069
Nope, not really.

06:58.113 --> 07:01.508
Back in D.C., dangerous fugitive
escapes state prison.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.292
All hands on deck.

07:03.335 --> 07:06.251
I get assigned his Aunt
Morrine's house in Anacostia.

07:06.295 --> 07:09.167
Three full days I observe
her sit on her couch,

07:09.211 --> 07:10.778
eating Lean Cuisines,

07:10.821 --> 07:12.127
watching Home Shopping Network.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.302
She didn't even buy anything.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.304
- Fugitive ever show up?
- Nah.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.740
They caught him on an Amtrak.

07:16.784 --> 07:19.526
Sounds like <i>Waiting for Godot.</i>

07:19.569 --> 07:21.266
Nah, his name
was Ronnie.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.878
Hey, you want to see, uh,
Gracie's recital video?

07:23.921 --> 07:25.793
It's 40 minutes,

07:25.836 --> 07:27.055
but it moves.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.273
You notice all these people

07:28.317 --> 07:29.666
heading into
the market?

07:29.710 --> 07:30.885
Yeah, a lot of people

07:30.928 --> 07:32.103
going in.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.149
And staying.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.071
Excuse me, uh...

07:53.821 --> 07:56.258
This could be
interesting.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.362
This has to be
a health code violation.

08:21.283 --> 08:23.111
Over there.

08:23.154 --> 08:26.854
Put me in here.
Put me in this game right here.

08:26.897 --> 08:29.117
Come on, man,
- I'm good for it.
- No more credit, Roy.

08:29.160 --> 08:33.382
When you got the dough,
then I'll let you play.

08:33.425 --> 08:34.426
It's coming any minute.

08:34.470 --> 08:35.819
Yeah, yeah. Right.

08:35.863 --> 08:38.909
Yeah. I'm sure it is,
like the last time.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.543
I see him.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.593
- NCIS!
- Get down, get down!

09:10.637 --> 09:12.073
Move, move!

09:30.352 --> 09:32.484
What happened
to "quiet surveillance"?

09:32.528 --> 09:34.574
We followed Burr
to a Chinese market

09:34.617 --> 09:37.054
that was a front for
an underground casino.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.795
Like, a <i>casino</i> casino?

09:38.839 --> 09:40.144
Like, slots and all.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.842
He got in a heated
conversation.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.844
He received a text,
rushed out in a hurry.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.890
We caught up in time to see him
take two bullets in the chest.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.500
Did you see the driver?

09:48.544 --> 09:50.546
Taillights of a black,
unmarked SUV.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.723
HPD's checking
traffic cams.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.725
The text, you think
it was related?

09:55.769 --> 09:57.945
Looked to me like he
was being lured out.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.208
Well, if he was involved
in getting rid of evidence

10:00.251 --> 10:01.644
on Santos's drug operation,

10:01.688 --> 10:03.428
now would be a good time
to clean house.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.693
It was definitelya setup.

10:06.736 --> 10:09.478
He got a message to pick up
an "overdue package"

10:09.521 --> 10:11.262
right before
he was shot.
Who sent it?

10:11.306 --> 10:12.786
No way of knowing.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.266
It was sent with
an encryption app called Vesla.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.051
We need to find out
who sent that message.

10:17.094 --> 10:19.270
- It's got to be Santos, right?
- Maybe.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.924
Who was Burr arguing with
in the casino?

10:20.968 --> 10:22.839
Name is Ike Diamond.
Runs the joint.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.537
Former Las Vegas
personal injury attorney,

10:25.581 --> 10:27.278
now... Full-time bookie.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.585
Half the guys in my department
lay bets with him.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.369
- And he's an attorney?
- Was.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.720
The Nevada Bar Association had
a thing or two to say

10:33.763 --> 10:35.330
about his more colorful hobbies.

10:36.374 --> 10:39.029
Guess it's time to seek counsel.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.209
Careful with the felt,
Jimmy.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.646
Ike Diamond.

10:46.689 --> 10:47.603
NCIS.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.865
Congratulations.

10:48.909 --> 10:50.432
There's Bubble Wrap
and packing tape

10:50.475 --> 10:51.694
under the craps table.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.174
Wrap the legs

10:53.217 --> 10:54.610
<i>before</i> you move them.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.743
We're not here
about the illegal casino.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.353
Objection. Speculative.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.268
We're here
about Roy Burr.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.227
He send you to brace me?

11:03.271 --> 11:04.751
Uh, to what, now?

11:04.794 --> 11:06.796
He thinks Burr sent us here
to beat him up.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.493
Well, he does owe me
a lot of money.

11:08.537 --> 11:11.235
Burr didn't send us.
He's dead.

11:13.281 --> 11:15.457
Get the hell out of here.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.111
Yeah, shot to death
a block away.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.286
No one mentioned that
when they came

11:18.329 --> 11:19.504
to arrest you and shut you down?

11:19.548 --> 11:20.854
This isn't a shutdown.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.246
It's a pause
in community relations.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.031
I'll be up and running
in a month.

11:24.074 --> 11:27.034
And I'll be released
in a couple hours.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.298
And Roy Burr?

11:31.778 --> 11:33.214
What, you think I did it?

11:33.257 --> 11:35.390
- He does owe you a lot of money.
- Not that I'm

11:35.433 --> 11:37.740
incriminating myself,
but in my line of work,

11:37.784 --> 11:40.177
you can't collect
from a dead man.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.876
You were seen arguing with him
right before he was gunned down.

11:42.919 --> 11:43.790
That's hearsay.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.487
I'm the one who saw you.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.491
Look, Roy Burr was
a degenerate gambler--

11:49.534 --> 11:51.058
God rest his soul.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.408
He's into me 20 large,
and he had the chutzpah

11:53.451 --> 11:56.324
to try to get back into
my weekly poker game on credit.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.456
But you're not trying to
incriminate yourself.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.980
It's a friendly home game.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.764
It probably includes
some of your bosses.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.766
We're not interested
in the gambling, Ike.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.987
Roy Burr was a cop,
probably dirty

12:07.030 --> 12:08.815
and working with
Trey Santos.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.730
Talk to us, Ike,
or you'll be arrested

12:10.773 --> 12:12.427
for more
than running a casino.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.951
My involvement
in the gambling arts

12:14.995 --> 12:17.127
has nothing to do
with Trey Santos.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.520
He's a patron.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.348
- Patron?
- At the poker game.

12:20.391 --> 12:23.481
Oh, you host drug kingpins
at your friendly game?

12:23.525 --> 12:25.048
I host anyone with cash.

12:25.092 --> 12:26.702
Crooks, politicians...

12:26.746 --> 12:27.921
And cops.

12:27.964 --> 12:29.618
Like Roy Burr.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.228
Roy Burr

12:31.272 --> 12:33.578
and Trey Santos play
in a weekly poker game together?

12:33.622 --> 12:35.363
Could've been where Santos
paid him off,

12:35.406 --> 12:36.886
gave him instructions.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.236
Yeah, like having Burr
destroy evidence for him,

12:39.280 --> 12:41.804
getting him out from under
a 20-year prison sentence.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.371
"Could've been"
doesn't solve the case.

12:43.414 --> 12:46.983
We need evidence tying Santos
to Burr's murder.

12:47.027 --> 12:49.072
We got the text luring Burr
out to the street

12:49.116 --> 12:50.421
right before he was shot.

12:50.465 --> 12:53.990
If we can connect it
to Santos...

12:54.034 --> 12:55.992
Good news, bad news.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.299
The text came from
an encrypted app,

12:58.342 --> 13:00.344
so the only way to
confirm who sent it

13:00.388 --> 13:01.868
is through the source.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.870
In other words,
Santos's phone.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.349
So we arrest him,

13:05.393 --> 13:06.829
subpoena his phone--
who knows what else

13:06.873 --> 13:08.439
- is on it?
- No, if we move in to arrest him,

13:08.483 --> 13:10.006
it's too easy for him
to bleach it,

13:10.050 --> 13:11.399
clean out
any of the messages.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.662
Didn't you say
there was good news?

13:13.705 --> 13:16.839
We can access his phone
without him knowing it.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.101
How do we do that?

13:18.145 --> 13:20.451
With CHAD.

13:22.105 --> 13:25.021
Cyber Hand
Data Recovery Device.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.981
That doesn't spell... I like the name CHAD.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.721
It can crack and clone

13:29.765 --> 13:31.941
Santos's phone
through Bluetooth.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.595
What's the catch?

13:34.639 --> 13:36.772
It needs to be
within a few feet

13:36.816 --> 13:38.382
of Santos's phone

13:38.426 --> 13:41.124
for at least 30 minutes
to actually work.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.735
Close and prolonged access
to a deadly drug dealer.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.173
Sounds... easy.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.523
Ike's poker game.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.786
It's tonight.
Santos will be there.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.397
- We send someone in.
- I'll do it.

13:53.441 --> 13:55.878
Seriously?'Cause I'm

13:55.922 --> 13:57.924
real good at playing poker.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.621
- How good?
- It depends.

13:59.664 --> 14:02.624
We talking hold 'em limit,
no limit, stud,

14:02.667 --> 14:04.321
Omaha, Omahahi-lo...

14:04.365 --> 14:05.583
She can name the games.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.672
This is
a high-stakes poker game

14:07.716 --> 14:09.892
where you have to play
well enough and last long enough

14:09.936 --> 14:11.894
to get Ernie's CHAD
next to Santos

14:11.938 --> 14:13.374
without him catching on.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.245
LuckyLucy007.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.899
Look it up.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.161
Retired the account

14:18.205 --> 14:20.381
before joining NCIS,
but it was

14:20.424 --> 14:23.819
a pretty feared avatar
in certain circles.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.300
Quite the side hustle.
Mm-hmm.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.171
Didn't get out
much in college.

14:29.825 --> 14:32.045
Lucy's going into
the game tonight.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.309
Grab Ike, bring him here.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.354
Ernie, show Lucy how CHAD works.

14:37.398 --> 14:40.009
This is our shot. Let's take it.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.359
I'm telling you now <i>
I can't wear a wire.</i>

14:42.403 --> 14:43.926
Sensitive nipples.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.797
Be sure to keep that in mind.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.712
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Diamond.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.063
Ernie here will tell you
exactly what you need to do

14:50.106 --> 14:52.065
for this undercover
operation to work.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.980
And you'll do it exactly
like we tell you,

14:54.023 --> 14:56.852
to avoid
felony racketeering charges.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.074
You'll place Trey Santos
in seat eight,

15:01.117 --> 15:03.467
next to the dealer.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.687
Special Agent Tara
will be in seat six.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.907
No way I'm getting Maury
Chauvin to change his seat.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.126
Remember that time I talked
about racketeering charges?

15:11.301 --> 15:13.086
Six it is!

15:14.087 --> 15:15.653
All you do is seat her

15:15.697 --> 15:17.917
within two feet of Santos
and his phone.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.570
Look, it may be my game,

15:19.614 --> 15:22.051
but it's Santos's world
when he comes.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.793
He brings muscle.
He controls everything.

15:24.836 --> 15:28.101
What's my exposure here
vis-à-vis the vicious drug lord?

15:28.144 --> 15:29.929
We will be surveilling
from across the street.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.974
Special Agent Tara will have
a hidden camera

15:32.018 --> 15:33.367
with a live feed.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.586
So what do I tell my players?

15:35.630 --> 15:38.328
I found her outside debate club
at Honolulu High?

15:38.372 --> 15:40.069
I mean,
work with me here.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.985
I am a rich girl from Texas
on vacation with my family

15:43.029 --> 15:45.683
looking for a little fun
- with Daddy's money.
- Listen,

15:45.727 --> 15:47.033
I'm not trying
to be sexist...

15:47.076 --> 15:47.990
But you're gonna be.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.035
Is this really

15:49.078 --> 15:50.775
the best person for the job?

15:50.819 --> 15:52.995
I mean, at least this guy
could read like a finance bro

15:53.039 --> 15:55.041
looking to scratch an itch.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.652
No.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.697
Do you even know
the basics?

15:59.741 --> 16:02.352
Like a flush beats
a straight.

16:02.396 --> 16:05.355
Sure. But I wouldn't take
a gutshot straight draw

16:05.399 --> 16:08.750
over a runner-runner flush draw
unless the pot odds

16:08.793 --> 16:11.405
were at least
four to one.
Annie Duke.

16:11.448 --> 16:12.623
She's like Annie Duke,
the professional...

16:12.667 --> 16:15.409
I know who Annie Duke is.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.933
It's gonna take more than that
to survive my game.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.804
My players come
for action.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.545
- Buy-in is $10
- K, minimum.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.460
And I'm not staking Uncle Sam.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.897
We got that.

16:32.643 --> 16:33.818
Whistler?

16:33.862 --> 16:35.472
Hey, it's me.

16:35.516 --> 16:38.736
I know you don't like surprises,
but I have exciting news.

16:38.780 --> 16:42.175
Or terrifying news.
Not sure which.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.048
Hello?

16:46.092 --> 16:48.311
I tried calling,
but it was...

16:48.355 --> 16:50.009
Pizza?

16:50.052 --> 16:51.923
Uh, n... Lucy.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.621
Oh. Sorry.
I thought you were the pizza.

16:53.664 --> 16:54.752
Are you a friend of Whistler's?

16:54.796 --> 16:56.363
Yeah. Sorry. I'm Cara.

16:56.406 --> 16:57.494
Cara?

16:57.538 --> 16:59.496
Whistler's girlfriend from D.C.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.194
I just got in.
You said your name

17:01.237 --> 17:02.369
was Lucy?

17:02.412 --> 17:04.197
- Lucy.
- Uh,

17:04.240 --> 17:06.329
yep, still Lucy.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.939
- Huh.
- Yeah. Oh, and this,

17:07.983 --> 17:10.464
this is, uh, Cara,
your girlfriend from D.C.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.509
Thought she was the pizza.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.729
Um...

17:14.772 --> 17:16.644
Okay, well, I-I'm off.

17:16.687 --> 17:19.081
It was lovely
- to meet you, Cara.
- Wait.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.648
Lucy, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, I can explain.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.476
That is... that is not
what it looks like.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.086
People always say that
in the movies,

17:24.130 --> 17:26.436
and it is always, in fact,
what it looks like.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.481
No. I didn't know
that she was coming.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.309
Well, I didn't know she existed.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.093
So I think I win
the dumbass award.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.486
Yes.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.270
No. No. I mean...
Okay, just give me a second,

17:34.314 --> 17:36.185
and I'll tell you
what happened.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.709
Enjoy your pizza.

17:45.151 --> 17:48.284
I'll check the comms
after I get this set up.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.592
Everything good
in there?

17:51.635 --> 17:53.463
Fine.
I'm just getting dressed.

17:53.507 --> 17:55.639
Okay. Great.

17:55.683 --> 17:56.901
She's nervous.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.033
You're nervous.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.252
Yeah, well,
it's a big deal.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.862
First undercover
assignment.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.559
She's going in alone.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.344
She's never done it
before. No weapon.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.346
Backup's 20 stories
and a block away.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.348
You know I can hear you.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.524
You're gonna do great!

18:12.787 --> 18:14.876
Oh.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.270
"Oh," thanks for setting up
all the equipment?

18:18.314 --> 18:22.101
Oh, I thought
Ernie would be doing it.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.624
Oh, no, he wouldn't be doing it.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.278
He'd just be sitting here
in silent judgment

18:25.321 --> 18:27.454
about how we're doing it wrong.

18:27.497 --> 18:30.413
I can hear you, too.
And you are doing it wrong.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.895
How you doing, Lucy?
Need any help?

18:38.160 --> 18:40.467
Lucy? It's Dalia.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.817
You good?

18:48.083 --> 18:49.432
Wow.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.306
You look...

18:53.349 --> 18:56.135
Like Texas Cinderella!

18:58.398 --> 19:00.008
You got CHAD?

19:00.051 --> 19:02.010
- Uh, yeah. Locked and loaded.
- Okay.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.707
Uh, here's your
purse thing.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.187
It's a clutch.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.406
You just face it this
way, so the camera

19:06.449 --> 19:07.842
can get a good look
at the table.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.017
Got it.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.410
Phone in there, too.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.151
- Hit any button.
- We kick through the door.

19:12.194 --> 19:15.589
Santos is arriving
with three men.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.249
Listen, you want
to call this off,

19:23.292 --> 19:25.642
just say the word and
we're out of here.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.777
Oh, honey, I got this.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.432
Y'all don't have to worry
about a thing.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.520
- Mm-mm.
- Hey, Luce?

19:33.563 --> 19:34.695
Mm-hmm?

19:34.738 --> 19:36.349
Forgot the money.

19:36.392 --> 19:37.611
Oh, oh, that's right.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.134
I, um... Cash.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.267
I usually pay
with credit card.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.530
How many times have you
played poker in person?

19:44.574 --> 19:46.750
Uh, including tonight? One.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.191
Oh, man.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.078
Evenin'.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.298
Y'all got room
for little ol' me?

20:23.134 --> 20:24.266
Phone in the box.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.789
Oh, I was told I
could keep mine.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.400
You know, in case I
need to order food...

20:27.443 --> 20:28.879
Phone in the box.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.016
I'm gonna need
to pat you down.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.279
Uh, fellas, fellas,
haven't you heard?

20:37.323 --> 20:39.368
It's 2022. No pat-downs.

20:39.412 --> 20:40.456
Come on.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.415
Come with me over here.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.199
What's your name gonna be?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.157
- Lucy.
- Mm.

20:46.201 --> 20:48.290
You look more like a Marla.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.422
Gentlemen...

20:49.465 --> 20:51.206
this is Marla.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.903
She's in town
from Dallas.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.644
I met her at the Royal Hawaiian
happy hour.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.298
The only thing

20:56.342 --> 20:58.344
she likes more than mai tais
is betting daddy's money.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.519
Whoo!

20:59.562 --> 21:00.911
That's Malcolm.

21:00.955 --> 21:02.217
Stanley.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.306
The handsome guy
over there is Maury.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.438
Trey.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.442
And this is
Bad Beat Rick.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.226
He's the best dealer
on the island

21:11.270 --> 21:12.880
who's currently
available.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.969
Oh, my G...

21:15.012 --> 21:16.405
White and blue chips.

21:16.449 --> 21:19.016
Just like my Cowboys.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.105
Y'all better watch out.

21:23.543 --> 21:26.850
What, do I have something
in my teeth?

21:26.894 --> 21:28.548
You have to give your money.

21:28.591 --> 21:29.897
For the chips.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.073
What did I tell
you guys?

21:32.116 --> 21:33.857
Tonight's special
is fresh fish.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.860
No offense, honey.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.385
I'm just excited to see
a little action.

21:39.428 --> 21:43.171
I mean, how many sea turtles can
one girl swim with, you know?

21:43.214 --> 21:45.042
What's a turtle call
his cell phone?

21:45.086 --> 21:46.217
A shell phone.

21:46.261 --> 21:48.655
Oh, my... Ha-ha-ha!

21:48.698 --> 21:50.570
See? She even likes
your stale jokes, Keen.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.267
I got a million of 'em.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.487
Less talking.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.140
More poker.

21:57.141 --> 22:00.667
My thoughts exactly, Mr. Trey.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.321
Mm-hmm.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.846
I'm gonna want I.D.s

22:05.889 --> 22:07.021
on all thoseplayers.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.109
Already on it.

22:08.152 --> 22:09.589
Besides Ike and Santos,

22:09.632 --> 22:12.461
we got Malcolm Keen,
a circuit judge,

22:12.505 --> 22:14.376
nicknamed "The Hangin' Judge"
'cause he likes a good time.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.770
- Explains the dad jokes.
- Next to Keen, we got

22:16.813 --> 22:18.902
Maury Chauvin, retired dentist,
and Stanley Zhao,

22:18.946 --> 22:21.557
Oahu's third most popular
car dealer.

22:21.601 --> 22:25.300
A judge and a drug dealer
at the same game.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.129
As long as there's no rake,
this kind of home game is legal.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.348
"Ish."

22:29.391 --> 22:31.393
Jesse, Kai, what do you know?

22:31.437 --> 22:33.569
They closed the curtains
on the game, but we counted

22:33.613 --> 22:35.919
at least three bodyguards
who came with Santos.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.443
Probably armed.

22:37.486 --> 22:39.445
Santos likes a
show of strength.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.229
Well, I don't like anything
about this.

22:41.272 --> 22:43.579
I mean, they made her get rid
of her cell phone.

22:43.623 --> 22:46.016
We have no way of contacting her
if this thing goes sideways.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.541
If it goes sideways, Jesse.

22:48.584 --> 22:51.239
Let's have a little faith,
brother.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.806
How long
until we're up and running

22:52.849 --> 22:54.634
- with your cloning device?
- The moment she activates it,

22:54.677 --> 22:56.766
it should start cloning
Santos's phone.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.689
Hey.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.605
Your move.

23:11.694 --> 23:13.479
Call.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.611
The bet was 6K.

23:15.655 --> 23:18.875
Oh, my. Well, um, okay.

23:20.877 --> 23:24.620
"Never leave a racehorse
in the pasture."

23:24.664 --> 23:26.579
That reminds me
of the story

23:26.622 --> 23:28.755
about the jockey
and his young Irish fiancée...

23:28.798 --> 23:30.191
Malcolm.

23:30.234 --> 23:31.584
Keep it PG.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.113
All in.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.465
Mm.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.516
Fold.

23:51.517 --> 23:52.953
Your racehorse
break a leg?

23:52.996 --> 23:54.824
Just got here.

23:54.868 --> 23:57.479
I'm not ready to turn in
my spurs just yet.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.350
You'll get me next time.

23:59.394 --> 24:00.656
I'm sure.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.312
"Chip and a chair,"
that's my motto.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.359
She just lost half her stake.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.144
Come on, Luce,
play smart.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.580
It's all good, Jesse.
She's got this.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.103
It's not her I'm worried about.

24:13.147 --> 24:14.931
Ernie, how long
until the phone is cloned?

24:14.975 --> 24:16.411
Working on an estimate.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.152
Ernie's all over it.

24:18.195 --> 24:19.458
Don't worry.

24:20.850 --> 24:25.638
Uh, so, uh, how exactly
did you and Ernie meet?

24:27.030 --> 24:30.686
I was, uh, at a
Mensa retreat...

24:30.730 --> 24:32.688
with my mom and dad.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.951
Ernie was in charge of
the dance competition.

24:34.995 --> 24:36.823
He wins every year.

24:36.866 --> 24:39.565
His partner backed
out last minute.

24:39.608 --> 24:42.306
He asked me
to fill in.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.831
Taught me how to
dance in a week.

24:44.874 --> 24:48.748
But I didn't just
learn how to dance.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.621
I learned about life, too.

24:54.884 --> 24:56.973
That's the plot
to <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

24:57.017 --> 24:58.540
It is?

24:58.584 --> 24:59.846
Like, beat for beat.

25:00.847 --> 25:01.891
Huh.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.371
Never seen it.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.417
We got a problem.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.028
What is it?

25:08.071 --> 25:10.160
CHAD's not downloading the data
from Santos's phone.

25:10.204 --> 25:12.249
You checked the device
before it went out, right?

25:12.293 --> 25:14.600
There's no problem with CHAD.
The problem is on Santos's side.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.340
His Bluetooth is turned off.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.299
Can't you just turn it on
remotely?

25:18.342 --> 25:19.692
No. Without Bluetooth,

25:19.735 --> 25:22.129
Santos's phone
can't send any data.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.697
Okay. What's the fix?

25:24.740 --> 25:26.916
I could remotely send a
Trojan that would activate

25:26.960 --> 25:28.875
the Bluetooth.
But then he would needThat sounds good.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.877
to call me directly,
stay on the phone long enough

25:30.920 --> 25:32.095
for me to hack in.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.314
Less good.

25:34.358 --> 25:37.361
Plus, there's no way
to let Lucy know any of this.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.670
Maybe there is.

25:41.714 --> 25:43.063
What time is it, you ask?

25:43.106 --> 25:46.457
It's pineapple margarita time!

25:46.501 --> 25:47.633
I'm not drinking.

25:47.676 --> 25:48.721
Hey, more for me, then.

25:48.764 --> 25:51.680
- All rightio.
- Thank you.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.116
Mm-hmm-hmm.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.291
Stanley,
you got it?

25:54.335 --> 25:55.945
Drink up, Marla.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.773
Thank you.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.514
Ah, thank you.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.777
And thank you.
That was wonderful.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.736
Very nice. Thank you.
You are so fantastic.

26:03.779 --> 26:05.607
That was great.
That was just beautiful,

26:05.651 --> 26:07.609
the way you brought
it over. Thank you.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.481
Your move, Texas.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.359
Gonna raise...

26:18.402 --> 26:20.404
to $3,000.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.278
Let's make it ten.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.544
Ooh. Okay.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.938
So, uh, before I call,

26:31.981 --> 26:34.418
I'm gonna need to speak
to my business manager,

26:34.462 --> 26:37.160
make sure I have enough cash
to buy back in if I lose.

26:37.204 --> 26:40.207
My phone's in the box
over there, so...

26:40.250 --> 26:43.166
No one leaves the table
once a hand is started.

26:44.777 --> 26:46.692
Can I use your phone?

26:48.128 --> 26:50.696
Unless you're afraid
I'm gonna call your raise.

26:59.443 --> 27:01.184
Thank you.

27:03.273 --> 27:05.232
Put it on speaker.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.930
Of course.

27:09.584 --> 27:10.846
Hello?

27:10.890 --> 27:13.414
Hey, Cal. It's, uh, Marla.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.851
Sorry for calling so late.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.853
How's Fort Worth treatin' ya?

27:19.507 --> 27:21.683
Marla, sweetheart!

27:21.727 --> 27:24.251
Fort Worth is as dry as
a heart of a haystack,

27:24.294 --> 27:27.907
but, uh, you know, otherwise
I can't complain. Heh.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.952
Oh, that's so great.
Listen, I need, um,

27:29.996 --> 27:33.608
- I need 20
- K wired to my "mad money" account.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.957
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.046
Course, little lady.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.700
Cash'll move faster

27:38.744 --> 27:41.877
than a chicken caught
in a coyote parade.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.923
You check your account...

27:43.966 --> 27:45.707
in 30 minutes.

27:45.751 --> 27:46.839
Thanks, Cal.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.144
Oh, say hi to Janey.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.276
I will.

27:49.319 --> 27:51.017
Bye-bye.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.934
Chicken caught
in a coyote parade?

27:59.503 --> 28:01.244
Well...

28:01.288 --> 28:04.465
guess I'm all in.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.394
Whoo!

28:20.437 --> 28:22.091
Hell yeah!

28:22.135 --> 28:24.659
Might not need
- that 20
- K after all.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.443
- You got lucky.
- Well,

28:26.487 --> 28:27.706
is there any other way

28:27.749 --> 28:29.316
to win?

28:33.276 --> 28:35.583
The Trojan worked.
Data from Santos's phone

28:35.626 --> 28:37.541
is being downloaded as we speak.

28:37.585 --> 28:40.240
We just need her to stay in
the game for 25 minutes longer.

28:40.283 --> 28:43.069
The moment Lucy leaves the
room, be ready to breach.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.680
I'll give you the go sign.
Copy that, boss.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.902
Raise.

28:56.212 --> 28:57.561
Reraise.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.135
All in, y'all.

29:09.312 --> 29:10.792
Take it.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.187
Lucky night, I guess.

29:15.797 --> 29:18.060
All right, gonna sit
this next one out and...

29:18.104 --> 29:20.410
find the ladies'.

29:28.418 --> 29:30.594
Come on, CHAD. Come on.

29:32.335 --> 29:33.641
Yes.

29:46.219 --> 29:48.917
Want to tell me what this means?

29:58.666 --> 30:00.755
Talk. If you...
if you want your money...

30:00.799 --> 30:02.104
You don't care about the money.

30:02.148 --> 30:03.758
You care about my phone.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.673
You're a cop,
trying to take me down.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.153
I don't know what you mean.

30:08.415 --> 30:10.939
Didn't realize
it was occupied.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.422
What the hell
- is happening?
- I'm an NCIS agent.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.685
We're gonna walk out
and straight to the exit.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.687
Understand?

30:23.604 --> 30:25.388
Where are we going?

30:28.174 --> 30:29.436
Away.

30:29.479 --> 30:30.872
Hey!

30:30.916 --> 30:32.569
Stop them!

30:34.528 --> 30:36.573
Something's happening in there.

30:37.574 --> 30:38.967
Where'd Lucy go?

30:39.011 --> 30:41.578
Jesse, you got eyes on her?

30:41.622 --> 30:44.146
No. But there's a lot
of activity on the balcony.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.018
Santos's men are moving fast.

30:46.061 --> 30:47.584
Go now.

30:48.585 --> 30:49.804
I need backup to
that location.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.066
We need to find Lucy.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.068
Wait, what happened to Lucy?

30:53.112 --> 30:54.461
Gonna tell me when you
started working

30:54.504 --> 30:56.855
with the cops
and how many others there are,

30:56.898 --> 31:00.162
or I'm gonna toss you
- and the shirt out the window.
- Girl just wanted to play poker.

31:01.555 --> 31:04.123
I don't have time to get
- into this right now.
- Lucy's in trouble, though?

31:04.166 --> 31:05.341
Her and Judge Keen.

31:05.385 --> 31:06.734
He's not in the main room,
either.

31:06.777 --> 31:09.215
Left the table
just after Lucy and Santos.

31:09.258 --> 31:11.521
Are you gonna tell
me what's going on?

31:11.565 --> 31:13.872
Only if you keep
your voice down.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.526
Trey Santos is
a drug dealer.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.311
He had a cop destroy evidence
against him,

31:18.354 --> 31:19.660
then killed the cop.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.618
He told me he was
in real estate.

31:21.662 --> 31:23.620
You have your phone
on you?

31:23.664 --> 31:26.319
It's in the box
with yours.

31:26.362 --> 31:29.496
Okay. Then we got to move.

31:29.539 --> 31:31.063
Jesse, Kai, are you on-site yet?

31:31.106 --> 31:32.847
Heading into the building now.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.414
Okay, will someone just tell me
what's going on?

31:34.457 --> 31:36.198
We sent Lucy undercover.
We think she's blown.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.026
Wait. What can I do?

31:38.070 --> 31:40.724
Just give us room, Whistler.

31:42.726 --> 31:43.945
Wait, hey.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.338
So-so what, you're
wired, right?

31:45.381 --> 31:46.774
Your backup
can hear you.

31:46.817 --> 31:49.255
Comms were in my clutch.
We're on our own.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.971
What now?

32:14.019 --> 32:15.803
- I protect you.
- What?

32:15.846 --> 32:17.718
Come on, get over here.

32:22.331 --> 32:24.594
Anyone have eyes on Lucy?

32:24.638 --> 32:26.857
She's in the wind.
But HPD's arriving

32:26.901 --> 32:29.425
- at the building now.
- Okay, she can't just disappear.

32:29.469 --> 32:30.731
Santos's data is ready.

32:30.774 --> 32:32.080
No time for that now.

32:32.124 --> 32:33.734
Uh, you're gonna want
to make time.

32:33.777 --> 32:34.865
It's anotherproblem.

32:34.909 --> 32:36.302
Santos isn't the one

32:36.345 --> 32:38.217
who lured Roy Burr to his death.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.435
But he was messaging
someone else

32:39.479 --> 32:40.959
directly after
the shooting.

32:41.002 --> 32:44.745
Says "Package delivered"
and "See you tonight."

32:44.788 --> 32:46.660
Someone else at the game
could be in on this.

32:46.703 --> 32:49.271
- One of Santos's men?
- Maybe.

32:49.315 --> 32:51.056
Need to take a closer
look at the players.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.579
I'll do it.

32:55.886 --> 32:57.714
Start with Ike Diamond,
guy who organized the game.

32:57.758 --> 32:59.760
Any kind of connection
to Trey Santos.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.414
I know how to dig up dirt,
Ernie.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.461
Get this piece of
crap to the car.

33:05.505 --> 33:06.985
Need to get you
to the car, too.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.073
Not until I find them.

33:08.116 --> 33:09.552
Police!

33:09.596 --> 33:11.424
Get down on
the ground now!

33:16.951 --> 33:18.083
Look what that crazy SOB

33:18.126 --> 33:19.736
- did to me!
- Where's Lucy?

33:19.780 --> 33:21.390
- No clue.
- And Santos's men?

33:21.434 --> 33:23.001
Uh, there's two more.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.567
Get back inside and wait.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.743
Kai, Santos just ran
into the stairwell.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.658
He's coming your way.

33:36.840 --> 33:37.885
Kai.

33:37.928 --> 33:38.973
I kind of need you, dude.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.627
I'm almost to you.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.822
Ah, you're welcome.

34:01.865 --> 34:04.042
- I softened him up a bit.
- Whatever makes you sleep well.

34:04.085 --> 34:06.305
But Santos escaped upstairs,
we think.

34:06.348 --> 34:08.655
Find him.
Get Lucy out of there.

34:08.698 --> 34:11.005
Ike Diamond is shady as hell,
but no real ties to Santos.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.268
I did find another
connection, though.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.183
Prosecutor who
oversaw Santos

34:15.227 --> 34:16.793
when he was a
confidential informant.

34:16.837 --> 34:18.360
Five years working
closely with Santos

34:18.404 --> 34:20.406
<i>and</i> your dead
cop Roy Burr.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.451
But there's no prosecutor
at the game.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.671
He's not a prosecutoranymore.

34:26.194 --> 34:27.891
- Stay behind me.
- Really?

34:27.935 --> 34:30.285
You are
an extreme pain in the ass.

34:30.329 --> 34:31.895
You got no move.
My backup's arrived.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.071
Do you hear the sirens?

34:33.114 --> 34:34.681
I'll take my chances.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.254
Where'd you get that?

34:43.255 --> 34:45.083
You can put that down now.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.623
You need to tell me
everything you know

35:03.666 --> 35:05.103
about Santos's operation.

35:05.146 --> 35:09.194
I guess I know
you're in on it, too.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.152
Took Roy Burr out.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.980
Shot Santos
so he couldn't implicate you.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.764
And what do your
people know?

35:14.808 --> 35:17.506
All of it. Every detail.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.682
No, no, no.
You said you weren't wired.

35:19.726 --> 35:22.163
You came for Santos, not me.

35:22.207 --> 35:25.253
My team's gonna come
through that door any moment.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.560
They find me dead,
they'll know what happened.

35:27.603 --> 35:28.865
Yeah.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.259
Santos killed you.
I killed him.

35:31.303 --> 35:32.695
Think this through,
Judge.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.610
You're gonna murder
a federal agent.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.134
That story won't hold.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.657
So I just surrender?

35:37.700 --> 35:39.049
Go to prison?

35:39.093 --> 35:40.747
Cooperate.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.531
We're way beyond that.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.098
Lucy!
- And you know it.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.665
I'm sorry about this.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.406
Me, too. Little tip, though.

35:47.449 --> 35:50.191
Lucy!
- Never let your target get this close.

36:22.005 --> 36:23.877
Are you all right?

36:25.226 --> 36:27.097
Oh, fine.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.973
Jesse,
I'm really okay.

36:34.104 --> 36:36.281
Well, I'm not.

36:36.324 --> 36:37.456
All right.

36:40.807 --> 36:42.243
Lucy's safe.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.202
Santos and Keen are dead.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.595
Well, that was exciting.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.162
Lucy's a tough one.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.208
Yeah.

37:00.174 --> 37:02.307
He said
he needed to talk to you.

37:02.350 --> 37:04.309
Well, I wanted to give you
an opportunity

37:04.352 --> 37:06.006
to thank me
for my help.

37:06.049 --> 37:08.051
We already sent you flowers,
Ike. You didn't get them?

37:08.095 --> 37:10.619
Yeah, also,
I wanted to go over

37:10.663 --> 37:13.361
this itemized list
of reimbursements.

37:13.405 --> 37:15.058
Reimbursements? Wha...?

37:15.102 --> 37:16.495
Condo's a rental.

37:16.538 --> 37:17.974
No way I'm getting
my security deposit back.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.498
And the nose.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.761
I'm seeing a plastic surgeon
in the morning.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.806
Reimbursement is you
not going to prison.

37:23.850 --> 37:25.286
Could I get that
in a notarized letter?

37:25.330 --> 37:26.722
- What'd you say?
- Just stating

37:26.766 --> 37:28.724
that I'm integral
to the work you do.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.726
Perhaps an honorary member
of NCIS.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.728
You know, just to help
with traffic violations,

37:32.772 --> 37:34.469
landlord disputes,

37:34.513 --> 37:36.297
misdemeanor racketeering...
I'm gonna count to three.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.734
So you'll think about it.
We'll stay in touch.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.345
Are you on Facebook?

37:41.868 --> 37:43.217
Okay.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.829
Howdy, partners.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.744
Came to check in.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.834
Oh...

37:51.878 --> 37:53.836
You were worried about us.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.229
I was worried about
the equipment.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.839
I-It's very fragile.

37:56.883 --> 38:00.016
Ernie, you know I was thrown
down a flight of stairs.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.583
You should get
that checked out.

38:04.543 --> 38:06.675
Hey, I'm gonna take this
down to the van.

38:06.719 --> 38:09.112
Jesse, you want to join me?

38:10.113 --> 38:11.985
Oh, yeah.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.605
Did you really just come
to check on the equipment?

38:23.649 --> 38:25.085
I really did.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.434
And you.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.741
Got intense there, huh?

38:28.784 --> 38:30.525
It did.

38:32.135 --> 38:35.443
But with your voice
in my ear...

38:35.487 --> 38:38.054
gave me all the strength
I needed.

38:38.098 --> 38:40.230
Dalia, it's a Thursday night.

38:40.274 --> 38:43.495
I know, but maybe we could make
an exception just this once?

38:44.539 --> 38:47.586
After all, I had...

38:47.629 --> 38:50.458
the time of my life.

38:52.025 --> 38:56.899
♪ And I've never felt
this way before. ♪

39:00.468 --> 39:02.731
Nobody puts Baby
in the corner.

39:26.755 --> 39:29.323
Heard you helped
Tennant and Ernie.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.629
I got... I got worried

39:30.672 --> 39:32.892
when you didn't answer
your phone.

39:32.935 --> 39:34.459
Came looking.

39:34.502 --> 39:36.156
Didn't exactly get that vibe

39:36.199 --> 39:38.419
when I came to
your place earlier.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.334
About that... At least I know now

39:40.378 --> 39:43.293
why you work so hard
to keep secrets.

39:43.337 --> 39:45.513
I've been your sidepiece.

39:45.557 --> 39:47.428
That... that is not it.

39:47.472 --> 39:48.560
Yeah?

39:48.603 --> 39:50.779
How'd I get it wrong?

39:51.780 --> 39:55.175
Um, Cara and I were...

39:55.218 --> 39:57.830
we were together
before I moved here.

39:57.873 --> 40:01.616
But it wasn't working, and I
thought the feeling was mutual.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.531
And you didn't
break up with her?

40:03.575 --> 40:06.621
I thought it would just...
fizzle out.

40:06.665 --> 40:09.624
I didn't... I didn't expect
that text from her this morning,

40:09.668 --> 40:13.715
or that she would just
show up... in town.

40:13.759 --> 40:16.196
And I really didn't expect...

40:16.239 --> 40:17.589
Expect what?

40:17.632 --> 40:19.460
You!

40:20.505 --> 40:21.593
I...

40:21.636 --> 40:23.333
I didn't...

40:25.988 --> 40:28.687
I didn't know you'd be
so important to me.

40:28.730 --> 40:31.124
I thought if I told you
about Cara,

40:31.167 --> 40:33.213
you'd end it.

40:33.256 --> 40:35.433
So not telling
me was better?

40:37.783 --> 40:38.958
I broke it off with Cara.

40:39.001 --> 40:41.700
Officially, I am...

40:41.743 --> 40:44.398
I am free and clear now.

40:46.269 --> 40:50.143
I had my first undercover
assignment today.

40:50.186 --> 40:51.666
Almost died.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.320
- I know.
- But...

40:53.363 --> 40:56.062
I learned something about myself
the last few hours.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.847
And...

40:58.891 --> 41:01.328
about who I can trust.

41:05.158 --> 41:08.509
There are a lot of chances--
bets, really--

41:08.553 --> 41:10.511
that, um...

41:10.555 --> 41:12.818
that I'm willing to take.

41:15.298 --> 41:17.736
You're no longer one of them.

41:20.608 --> 41:22.044
Lucy...

41:22.088 --> 41:24.003
Please don't say anymore.

41:45.590 --> 41:48.114
You see any of that?

41:51.204 --> 41:53.641
All I see...

41:53.685 --> 41:57.340
is an agent whose
first undercover mission

41:57.384 --> 41:59.560
was a success.

42:05.827 --> 42:08.308
I don't think
I want to talk.

42:12.138 --> 42:14.444
Who said anything
about talking?
