12:01.929 --> 12:04.890
Ay! I'm so sorry
your mother abandoned you.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.026
And the blonde wife.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.237
Her name's "Lorna."
She speaks Spanish.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.416
- Did she kill someone?
- No, and she speaks Spanish.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.251
- Really? I thought she was Greek.
- No.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.805
You're sweet to come here,
but this isn't a good time.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.307
When is it a good time?

12:46.307 --> 12:48.976
I guess not when you're half-dead
in the hospital.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.311
It wasn't that serious.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.229
Not the first time
you didn't tell me something.

12:52.229 --> 12:55.191
We've been over this.
What were you going to do for me in rehab?

12:55.191 --> 12:58.652
"Do"? I'm your mother.
I gave birth to you. Raised you by myself.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.070
Don't be dramatic, Mama.

13:00.738 --> 13:01.739
What if it was Hayley?

13:01.739 --> 13:03.991
What if she nearly died
and didn't tell you?

13:05.576 --> 13:07.495
I understand. I really do.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.456
But understand I'm in the middle
of a trial, and I have to get back.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.084
So, I finally get to see my son in court?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.670
No, no, no, Ma.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.840
Court is my stage.
I can't have any distractions.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.928
I understand, but you can't go like this.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.806
You're skinny. Pale.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.016
Look.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.186
Manzanilla for healing.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.314
Naranjo for your appetite.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.817
Jengibre is wonderful.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.028
And most importantly,
three months of antibiotics.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.113
They were half price in Tijuana.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.533
You're still doing those infomercials?

13:49.870 --> 13:51.121
Give me one second.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.602
I'm covered in poop.

31:13.663 --> 31:15.373
This is for three days?

31:15.373 --> 31:18.793
Casting directors.
You never know what look they want.

31:22.922 --> 31:24.048
You seem happy.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.218
I've got an audition tomorrow for a pilot.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.887
You know what this means?

31:28.887 --> 31:32.140
I could be here all the time
with you and Hayley.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.225
All the time?

31:37.353 --> 31:38.980
Give me one second.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.350
Why didn't you tell me
you're on the cover?

32:15.350 --> 32:17.060
Because this
is not important.

32:17.060 --> 32:20.563
No? Think about where you were a year ago.

32:20.563 --> 32:23.608
Hooked on drugs. Working out of your car.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.193
I like working out of my car.

32:25.193 --> 32:28.988
Now you have respect.
The whole city knows who you are.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.865
You're comparing me to him.

32:31.366 --> 32:32.909
You have his ring on.

32:34.577 --> 32:38.081
Your father and I
both wanted to be the star.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.416
That never works.

32:40.416 --> 32:43.670
Now, you're the star. Our son.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.297
Why can't you let me be proud of you?

32:46.297 --> 32:49.425
I do let you. I adore you.
I'm gonna take your luggage to the room.

32:49.425 --> 32:52.303
I adore you, too, my beautiful boy.
