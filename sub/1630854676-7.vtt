WEBVTT

01:01.208 --> 01:08.000
The entire galaxy believes Rampart's lies,
even the Senate. It's not right.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.250
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it. Let it go.

01:12.250 --> 01:18.041
How can I? Kamino was our home,
and we destroyed it.

01:18.041 --> 01:24.708
All those cities, all those people,
gone, because of what we did.

01:24.708 --> 01:27.333
We were following orders.

01:27.333 --> 01:33.500
Oh, were we? Then--
Then why is Rampart covering it up, huh?

01:35.250 --> 01:39.666
I'm sorry, Slip.
I can't stay silent any longer.

01:40.791 --> 01:43.416
Wait. What did you do?

01:44.791 --> 01:46.875
I sent a message to Rampart.

01:47.583 --> 01:53.541
Gave him the chance to tell the Senate
the truth before I did it myself.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.666
Cade! Cade, stop!

02:25.208 --> 02:29.958
You know what Rampart's capable of.
It's too dangerous.

02:29.958 --> 02:36.791
Slip, we're not bad men,
but what we did was wrong.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.208
Please, I need your help.
Together we can--

03:39.333 --> 03:40.916
Secure the perimeter.

04:00.791 --> 04:05.375
While the cataclysmic storm
on Kamino was tragic,

04:05.375 --> 04:12.208
the reality is that without the production
of new clone troopers, we are vulnerable.

04:12.208 --> 04:18.791
Admiral Rampart's proposed Defense
Recruitment Bill will keep us protected.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.666
I concur with the honorable delegate
of the Banking Clan.

04:25.666 --> 04:29.875
A new conscripted military
is what this galaxy needs.

04:29.875 --> 04:34.458
One comprised of the people,
who fight for the people.

04:34.458 --> 04:38.166
This recruitment bill has been
discussed, debated,

04:38.166 --> 04:41.416
and tabled each session for a reason.

04:41.416 --> 04:44.208
There are more pressing matters
in the galaxy right now

04:44.208 --> 04:47.458
than the costly creation
of a new military.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.000
The war is over.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.208
Perhaps where you reside, Senator Pamlo.

04:52.208 --> 04:56.208
But the Mid and Outer Rims are rife
with insurgents.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.875
We must be protected.

04:59.250 --> 05:04.083
The deployment of the clone army was
a result of the Emergency Powers Act,

05:04.083 --> 05:10.166
put forward by then Chancellor Palpatine
during the Separatist crisis.

05:10.166 --> 05:13.875
Shifting to a military
of citizens swearing loyalty

05:13.875 --> 05:17.833
fundamentally goes against
the principles of this body.

05:17.833 --> 05:23.666
I strongly disagree, Senator Organa.

05:24.416 --> 05:27.041
Where does the Emperor stand
on this issue,

05:27.041 --> 05:30.291
since he remains absent
from these proceedings?

05:32.416 --> 05:37.875
The Emperor, as always, trusts this
delegation to act in the best interests

05:37.875 --> 05:40.416
of all galactic citizens.

05:40.416 --> 05:43.416
And what about the interests
of the clone troopers?

05:43.416 --> 05:46.125
Why are they not included
within this legislation?

05:47.333 --> 05:52.833
The clone army cannot sustain
given their accelerated aging

05:52.833 --> 05:55.708
and should be slated for decommissioning.

05:56.291 --> 05:59.166
They are not droids
to simply be shut down.

05:59.166 --> 06:03.125
These are soldiers who defended us,
defended our worlds.

06:03.125 --> 06:10.083
Mmm, I didn't realize you spoke
on the clones' behalf, Senator Chuchi.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.541
If we don't, who will?

06:13.125 --> 06:16.583
After all they have sacrificed,
you now wish to discard them?

06:16.583 --> 06:18.000
Leave them with nothing?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.750
Is that how we repay them
for their service?

06:21.833 --> 06:24.750
Is that what this Empire stands for?

06:25.250 --> 06:28.125
How can we debate commissioning a new army

06:28.125 --> 06:30.875
without a plan in place
to care for our current one?

06:38.333 --> 06:40.833
I hear your concerns, Senator Chuchi.

06:41.416 --> 06:44.750
Allow me to assure this delegation
that provisions are in place

06:44.750 --> 06:47.833
to aid the clones
as they begin to be phased out.

06:48.333 --> 06:52.375
What do you know about their needs,
Admiral? Have you asked them?

06:53.625 --> 06:55.833
Or do they not get a say in their future?

06:56.416 --> 06:59.833
I am open to discussing
any and all provisions you,

06:59.833 --> 07:01.625
or the clones, have in mind.

07:02.833 --> 07:07.083
If we work together, I am confident
we can adequately address their concerns.

07:09.208 --> 07:15.583
Well, until then, I motion to table
the vote on the Defense Recruitment Bill.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.000
I second.

07:33.041 --> 07:36.083
Governor Tarkin assured me
you were capable of getting the Senate

07:36.083 --> 07:37.708
to support this bill.

07:38.208 --> 07:41.666
I am not the one who will suffer
if it doesn't pass.

07:42.166 --> 07:46.500
It will.
A few vocal senators will not derail us.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.708
They already have.

07:48.708 --> 07:54.375
If any of them begin to dig further
into what truly happened to Kamino,

07:54.375 --> 07:57.416
then this legislation is at risk.

07:57.416 --> 07:59.708
And so are you.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.750
I have measures in place
to ensure that doesn't happen.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.833
Let Senator Chuchi make her demands
for the clones.

08:07.416 --> 08:10.500
Once she's appeased, the Defense
Recruitment Bill will be approved

08:10.500 --> 08:13.833
long before any of the provisions
she's seeking come due.

08:14.333 --> 08:19.250
For your sake, Admiral,
be certain there are no more surprises.

08:29.250 --> 08:32.958
So, that's it? We served our purpose
and now they want us out?

08:32.958 --> 08:36.833
That's why I'm here,
to better understand your needs.

08:36.833 --> 08:41.291
I need to stay a trooper.
Can you make that happen?

08:41.291 --> 08:45.916
Well, no, but once a clone
has completed the required rotations--

08:45.916 --> 08:48.708
Yeah, the Empire declares us obsolete.
We know.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.875
Talking won't change that.

08:51.375 --> 08:54.833
But it can change your futures.
I can craft a pension plan--

08:54.833 --> 08:57.166
Pension plan?

08:57.166 --> 09:01.083
I'd rather be out there fighting those
insurgent groups that keep popping up.

09:07.583 --> 09:11.166
And what happens
when you're too old to fight?

09:13.958 --> 09:16.333
That's not a scenario
we are trained to think about.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.500
It's time you did. All of you.

09:21.125 --> 09:25.666
As difficult as it is to accept,
your military service will come to an end.

09:26.541 --> 09:28.875
You get to choose what your lives will be.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.916
You've spent years fighting for us.
Let me fight for you.

09:32.916 --> 09:38.375
Tell me how to help and I will make sure
Admiral Rampart's bill meets your needs.

10:06.541 --> 10:10.125
Thank you for trusting me.
I'll do what I can.

10:14.791 --> 10:15.791
Senator.

10:16.708 --> 10:17.708
Yes?

10:18.208 --> 10:21.083
Are you truly intent on helping clones?

10:22.833 --> 10:25.125
You have no representation in the Senate.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.875
You deserve to have someone speak
on your behalf.

10:27.875 --> 10:31.833
It won't matter.
Admiral Rampart can't be trusted.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.666
Why not?

10:33.666 --> 10:36.500
He's lied to you. To everyone.

10:37.333 --> 10:40.875
Kamino wasn't destroyed by a storm.

10:40.875 --> 10:44.375
It was an attack ordered
by Rampart himself.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.500
Why would you make such an accusation?

10:51.500 --> 10:55.041
I was there, aboard his <i>Venator</i>.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.916
He had us open fire on the cities.

10:59.625 --> 11:03.458
If that were true, the Senate would know.
Someone would have come forward.

11:03.458 --> 11:06.000
Rampart made sure no one could.

11:06.583 --> 11:10.125
Clones who tried to speak up
were either reassigned,

11:10.125 --> 11:15.500
went missing or ended up dead.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.208
You don't look well, trooper.

11:19.916 --> 11:21.041
The name's Slip.

11:21.708 --> 11:26.333
Check my service record
if you don't believe me. CT-0409.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.625
You seem like
one of the good ones, Senator.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.541
Be careful.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.875
Everything all right?

11:37.500 --> 11:40.750
Yes. Everything's fine.

12:01.333 --> 12:04.500
Senator Chuchi,
Admiral Rampart is expecting you.

12:05.083 --> 12:07.708
Have you located trooper CT-0409?

12:07.708 --> 12:10.416
Not yet, but we will keep looking.

12:43.458 --> 12:47.250
It's Slip. [sighs] I'm in some trouble.

12:48.416 --> 12:53.125
I've heard you can help get me out, but
you have to hurry. I don't have much time.

13:01.250 --> 13:05.583
You expect the Empire to fund
a new military and full pensions

13:05.583 --> 13:08.166
for millions of clone troopers?

13:08.166 --> 13:10.083
If that is not manageable, Admiral,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.125
then perhaps now is not the time
for your recruitment bill.

13:15.041 --> 13:17.125
Oh, I wish that were the case,

13:17.125 --> 13:21.458
but the murmurs of rising threats
and insurgency are more than rumors.

13:21.458 --> 13:24.333
My priority is keeping the galaxy safe.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.666
But I do agree with you.

13:29.250 --> 13:32.833
The future of the clones requires
further discussion and planning.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.458
We owe them that, for their service.

13:41.416 --> 13:43.291
Something troubling you, Senator?

13:45.541 --> 13:49.916
The storm that caused the cities
of Kamino to fall.

13:50.916 --> 13:53.416
How is it that you survived?

13:55.791 --> 13:59.041
I was taking part
in a training exercise off-world.

13:59.583 --> 14:03.333
If I had been present,
perhaps more could have been saved.

14:03.958 --> 14:06.958
It was a tragedy.

14:06.958 --> 14:10.916
The majority of the Kaminoan population
was lost, Admiral.

14:11.833 --> 14:14.500
That is beyond tragic.

14:15.083 --> 14:18.708
Indeed. But we must move forward.

14:19.750 --> 14:22.708
Perhaps it is easier for some than others.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.333
Good day, Admiral.

15:04.958 --> 15:08.041
Senator Chuchi.
You've received a secure communication.

15:09.625 --> 15:10.625
From whom?

15:36.666 --> 15:37.750
Yes?

15:44.958 --> 15:46.875
It's all right. Wait here.

15:57.375 --> 15:58.416
Senator Organa?

15:59.208 --> 16:00.208
Hello, Riyo.

16:00.875 --> 16:04.208
R2-C4, keep an eye out.

16:06.166 --> 16:09.541
You caused quite a stir
during yesterday's session.

16:09.541 --> 16:14.166
Curious how speaking up for what's right
has become an act that causes a stir,

16:14.166 --> 16:17.625
unlike inaction, apathy, or ignorance.

16:17.625 --> 16:18.916
Indeed.

16:19.583 --> 16:25.250
I heard you had a meeting
with Admiral Rampart. Was it productive?

16:25.250 --> 16:26.541
Surprisingly so.

16:27.250 --> 16:31.625
I expected more pushback, yet he conceded
to many of my requests for the clones.

16:32.208 --> 16:35.791
Rampart is skilled at saying
all the right things.

16:35.791 --> 16:38.958
Especially when he doesn't want
anyone looking deeper.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.208
So I've been hearing.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.708
There are other whispers
if you listen closely enough.

16:47.375 --> 16:50.708
The issue of clone rights is
part of a much bigger picture.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.458
These insurgencies that have arisen.

16:53.458 --> 16:58.625
Their numbers are growing,
and the Emperor is afraid.

16:58.625 --> 17:02.416
If systems begin to revolt
as they did with the Republic,

17:02.416 --> 17:04.500
that will threaten his new Empire.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.541
It's rather convenient, wouldn't you say?

17:08.041 --> 17:12.083
How a catastrophic storm destroyed
the cloning facilities on Kamino,

17:12.750 --> 17:15.708
making way for the Empire's new military.

17:15.708 --> 17:19.166
Tipoca City, designed to be submersible,

17:19.166 --> 17:21.833
weathered thousands of storms
over the years,

17:22.333 --> 17:24.958
yet it's suddenly wiped off the map.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.500
I spoke to a clone

17:27.500 --> 17:30.666
who claimed Rampart gave an order
to attack the Kaminoan cities.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.416
Did he offer proof?

17:32.416 --> 17:35.000
He said he was assigned
to the ship that opened fire.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.625
If we can convince him to testify.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.041
Where's the clone now?

17:40.041 --> 17:42.416
In hiding. My guards are out searching.

17:42.416 --> 17:47.833
Be careful, Riyo. You may not be
the only one looking for him.

18:01.541 --> 18:03.750
Have you located the clone?

18:04.333 --> 18:10.916
<i>Not yet. But Senator Chuchi's guards
have also been searching for him.</i>

18:11.500 --> 18:16.291
Follow the senator.
If she finds him, handle it.

18:16.291 --> 18:18.916
<i>The senator as well?</i>

18:19.500 --> 18:23.166
Yes. Ensure it can't lead back to me.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.208
<i>Understood.</i>

18:48.250 --> 18:51.958
I'm at the rendezvous. Where are you?

18:53.083 --> 18:54.916
<i>I'm en route. Hang tight.</i>

19:09.583 --> 19:11.333
Easy, trooper.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.583
Senator?

19:16.291 --> 19:18.291
You're a hard person to track down.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.375
What are you doing here?

19:21.250 --> 19:24.250
I believe you were telling the truth
about Admiral Rampart.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.291
I want you to help me.

19:26.291 --> 19:29.500
No. No. No, no. No, no.
I'm leaving once he gets here.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.625
Who?

19:31.208 --> 19:36.583
Someone who can make me disappear,
where the Empire can't find me.

19:36.583 --> 19:38.041
How did you even find me?

19:38.041 --> 19:42.625
Were you followed?
If you can get to me, so can they.

19:42.625 --> 19:45.958
I can protect you. Once the Senate hears
what you have to say--

19:45.958 --> 19:50.000
Senator, you're not listening to me.
They already killed Cade.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.208
My life is in danger. Yours will be too.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.166
You have to go.

19:55.166 --> 19:56.250
Wait!

19:57.666 --> 20:00.541
His attack on Kamino didn't
just affect the cloning facilities.

20:00.541 --> 20:03.083
Rampart wiped out entire cities.

20:05.916 --> 20:10.166
Those who perished, including the clones
who died trying to speak the truth,

20:10.166 --> 20:11.916
they deserve justice.

20:24.833 --> 20:26.500
Testify before the Senate.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.875
Rampart must be held accountable.

20:33.208 --> 20:36.458
Senator, I must insist we leave.
It's not secure here.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.791
Yeah, he's right, and you don't need me.

20:39.791 --> 20:42.416
The evidence you want is
aboard Rampart's ship.

20:42.416 --> 20:44.250
Check the bridge's command log.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.416
I saved a backup to the central system---

20:47.458 --> 20:48.875
Protect the Senator!

21:02.666 --> 21:03.833
We have to go.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.125
We move out on three.

22:01.666 --> 22:04.250
I'll draw him out.
Run for the door. Get to the speeder!

22:06.458 --> 22:07.708
I'll be right behind you!

23:04.791 --> 23:06.000
You all right, Senator?

23:06.000 --> 23:10.458
Captain Rex? Wha-- What is going on?

23:10.958 --> 23:13.041
I was hoping you could tell me.

23:13.708 --> 23:17.333
I came to meet a clone contact of mine
when I heard the blaster fire.

23:17.333 --> 23:19.041
You were who Slip was meeting?

23:19.875 --> 23:22.583
He's dead. So are my guards.

23:23.083 --> 23:25.000
What happened?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.500
Slip told me about
what truly happened to Kamino.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.375
I wanted him to testify before the Senate.

23:31.083 --> 23:34.375
Someone was sent to make sure
that would never happen.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.083
A clone?
Why would a trooper do such a thing?

23:53.083 --> 23:54.416
He's not a trooper.

23:54.416 --> 24:00.708
Not sure what he is, but I suggest
we question him somewhere more hidden.

24:01.416 --> 24:03.458
And I have just the place.

24:24.041 --> 24:25.208
Where are we?

24:25.791 --> 24:29.500
Couple friends of mine own this garage.
They're gone for a bit.

24:35.625 --> 24:38.791
Nice of you to join us. You got a name?

24:40.833 --> 24:41.833
Hmm.

24:42.875 --> 24:45.666
You're not wearing
any identifiable markings.

24:46.291 --> 24:47.416
Who do you work for?

24:49.708 --> 24:52.750
Don't want to talk about yourself? Fine.

24:52.750 --> 24:55.666
Tell me whose orders you were following,
and I'll let you go.

24:58.458 --> 25:02.458
No, you won't, Captain Rex.

25:03.958 --> 25:07.416
You're fighting the wrong battle, brother.

25:07.416 --> 25:08.916
You're limited.

25:09.666 --> 25:11.166
So, what does that make you?

25:16.041 --> 25:18.375
A believer.
