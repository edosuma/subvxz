00:14.287 --> 00:16.926
My old man wrote me a letter from prison once.

00:16.967 --> 00:20.926
It said, "If you don't wanna end up like me,
stay away from crime, women and drugs."

00:20.967 --> 00:24.482
Problem is,
it don't leave you with much else to do, does it?

00:24.527 --> 00:26.518
# DURAN DURAN: Planet Earth

00:40.087 --> 00:42.362
# Only came outside

00:42.407 --> 00:46.036
# To watch the nightfall with the rain

00:47.247 --> 00:52.116
# I heard you making patterns rhyme

00:53.247 --> 00:56.284
# Like some New Romantic

00:56.327 --> 01:00.764

01:01.567 --> 01:06.766
# You'll see I'm right some other time

01:09.767 --> 01:12.440
# Look now, look all around

01:14.647 --> 01:17.115
# There's no sign of life...
- Put the fucking gun down!

01:17.167 --> 01:19.476
Put the fucking gun down, you Spanish cunt!

01:23.407 --> 01:25.967
Put it down! Fucking put it down!

01:26.007 --> 01:28.202
Don't fucking move, you fat pot-nosed cunt!

01:28.967 --> 01:31.720
Where is it, you fucking little cunt?

01:31.767 --> 01:34.565
# You're looking at Planet Earth

01:38.207 --> 01:41.836
# This is Planet Earth
- Fucking put it down or I'll kill you!

01:41.887 --> 01:45.243
- For fuck's sake, just tell us...
- Where's the fucking gear?

01:45.767 --> 01:47.598
Tell me where the fucking gear is!

01:47.647 --> 01:49.399
(Music stops)
- Tell me where it is!

01:49.447 --> 01:51.642
Else I swear I'll fucking kill the lot of you!

01:51.687 --> 01:53.678
- Where? Where?
(Gunshot)

01:55.007 --> 01:57.282
Ten years in paradise living the dream.

01:57.327 --> 01:59.158
It had to come to an end one day.

01:59.207 --> 02:02.643
But there was a time when me and the playboy
had the world in our hands.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.120
Anyway, fuck it.

02:04.167 --> 02:07.239
Better to be someone for a day
than no-one for a lifetime.

02:09.127 --> 02:10.606
(Sirens)

02:15.247 --> 02:17.238
(Rumble of jet engines)

02:19.007 --> 02:20.406
What is it?

02:20.447 --> 02:22.438
Learjet.

02:22.487 --> 02:24.478
Only way to travel.

02:26.007 --> 02:27.998
Be someone.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.684
I have only one thing to say.

02:32.727 --> 02:35.400
You turn if you want to.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.597
(Laughter and applause)

02:37.647 --> 02:39.956
The lady's not for turning.

02:40.007 --> 02:41.599
WOMAN: Someone's had it.

02:41.647 --> 02:44.957
MAN: Have it right, woman.
I never lifted your money!

02:45.007 --> 02:46.884
- Leave her alone, Joe.
- It's all right.

02:46.927 --> 02:48.246
I'll sort it.

02:48.287 --> 02:52.758
- Yeah, run along, boy. Do as your mother says.
- You touch her and I'll kill you.

02:57.767 --> 02:58.995
Now get out, you bum.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.121
Be someone.

03:01.167 --> 03:03.635
- What?
- I'm gonna be someone.

03:03.687 --> 03:05.166
And I'm gonna ruin you.

03:05.207 --> 03:06.959
You'll never be anything.

03:07.007 --> 03:10.716
You ain't got the character, boy.
Now, go on, fuck off.

03:16.567 --> 03:20.162
You pay me or else you've fucking had it!

03:22.407 --> 03:24.477
I'm fucking sick of it, do you hear me?

03:24.527 --> 03:26.518
I'm fucking sick of it!

03:26.567 --> 03:28.558
(Mother screams and wails)

03:30.007 --> 03:31.998
(Blows continue)

03:35.327 --> 03:36.760
What am I gonna do, Jim?

03:36.807 --> 03:38.399
Fancy a bit of sun?

03:38.447 --> 03:40.005
I'm fucking polo.

03:40.047 --> 03:43.881
I got something needs delivering.
I'll look after you.

03:49.527 --> 03:51.165
Get the bag straight to the man.

03:51.207 --> 03:54.677
If you get lost down there,
just ask for the playboy.

03:54.727 --> 03:58.197
I understand, Jim.
But tell me what's in the bag, please.

03:58.247 --> 03:59.726
Biscuits.

03:59.767 --> 04:02.235
- Biscuits...

06:15.247 --> 06:17.807
Listen, you'd better fuck off now.

06:17.847 --> 06:19.075
Go on.

06:19.887 --> 06:21.366
Is that my bag?

06:23.007 --> 06:26.682
- Oi, kid. Is that bag for me?
- Yeah.

06:28.127 --> 06:30.516
- So, what's your name, kid?
- Frankie.

06:31.527 --> 06:33.563
Kid Frankie, eh?

06:34.407 --> 06:35.999
Here!

06:36.047 --> 06:37.878
Take it.

06:38.847 --> 06:40.838
So, what's your story?

06:41.727 --> 06:45.117
- I'm just doing what Jimmy asked.
- He said you were from good stock.

06:45.167 --> 06:46.839
Did you look in the bag?

06:50.287 --> 06:52.039
So, what's your plans?

06:53.167 --> 06:54.316
I dunno.

06:55.967 --> 06:57.878
I'll see you out, then.

07:02.247 --> 07:06.320
FRANKIE: You had to wonder how this
character ended up on the beaches of Spain.

07:06.367 --> 07:07.561
You drive.

07:09.767 --> 07:11.723
It was never about the money for Charlie.

07:11.767 --> 07:14.361
It was about the power and what went with it.

07:14.407 --> 07:16.045
And could you fucking blame him?

07:16.087 --> 07:17.600
He just loved the lifestyle.

07:17.647 --> 07:20.719
Stay down! Don't look at me!
Don't fucking look at me!

07:20.767 --> 07:24.077
I shit you not, he walked on water.
Everything he touched turned to gold.

07:24.127 --> 07:26.925
His fucking bed made itself in the mornings.

07:26.967 --> 07:28.446
That's how cool he was.

07:30.847 --> 07:33.407
What you fucking do that for, you lunatic?

07:33.447 --> 07:35.642
- You've just fucked us!
- And fucked 'em, he had.

07:35.687 --> 07:39.646
Everyone knew it was the Peckham Four.
There was a national witch-hunt for them.

07:39.687 --> 07:43.362
But the police were too busy nicking
fare-dodgers and junkie bag-snatchers,

07:43.407 --> 07:46.717
while Charlie and the gunman
slipped across the drink towards Spain.

07:47.687 --> 07:50.440
Like I said, he walked on fucking water.

07:59.607 --> 08:01.279
You can drive, can't you?

08:01.327 --> 08:03.283

Shot to pieces back in London.

08:09.847 --> 08:13.999
I tell you what, play your cards right, and I might
give you a job in the club. How's that sound?

08:14.047 --> 08:16.356
- Yeah.
- Good boy. (Laughs)

08:16.407 --> 08:19.160
CHILDREN: Charles! Charles!
- All right, son, how are you?

08:19.207 --> 08:21.846
- All right, Charles?
- Local brasshouse, got it?

08:21.887 --> 08:24.003
- I've never had a brass.
- Never had a brass?

08:24.047 --> 08:26.766
You leave it to me. I'll allocate you a plate later.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.286
- Charlie.
- Ronnie.

08:28.327 --> 08:31.603
Got those couple of cases of Bolly
in the boot of the motor you wanted.

08:31.647 --> 08:34.525
I'll get a barmaid to pick 'em up.
Are you with me tonight?

08:34.567 --> 08:36.876
You ain't wrong, mate. She's given me a pass.

08:36.927 --> 08:39.600
Ronnie, Frankie. Frankie, Ronnie.

08:39.647 --> 08:42.719
As it happens, my Shirl's there shopping.
If you see her, say hello.

08:42.767 --> 08:45.964
I will do. I'll speak to you later.

08:52.287 --> 08:54.960
- All right, Shirl? All right, Nor?
- All right, Charl?

08:55.007 --> 08:56.440
Spending the old man's money?

08:56.487 --> 08:58.557
(Whispers) Fuck me, he's a bit of all right.

08:58.607 --> 09:00.404
Who's the boy?

09:00.447 --> 09:02.483
- It's the Kid Frankie.
- Dish.

09:03.407 --> 09:07.400
Listen, Laura's next door buying a little twinset.
She's got the right hump with you.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.085
Put the car in gear.

09:09.127 --> 09:12.517
- Put the car in gear?
- Put it in gear, put it in gear!

09:12.567 --> 09:13.966
You wanker, Charlie!

09:14.007 --> 09:16.999
I waited for you for three hours last night.
Where was you?

09:17.047 --> 09:20.198
Fucking South London gangster? Look at you.
Cardboard cut-out cunt.

09:20.247 --> 09:23.000
You fucking look like a Paki.
What's the matter with you?

09:23.047 --> 09:24.560
Drive on.

09:25.767 --> 09:28.235
# You, you, you, you

09:28.287 --> 09:32.041
# You got me hangin' on a string now

09:32.087 --> 09:34.920
# Am I your plaything?

09:34.967 --> 09:37.083
# You never told me you were waiting...

09:38.367 --> 09:40.927
Lay so much as a fucking finger on her
and you're dead.

09:40.967 --> 09:43.879
- I weren't looking at her, I swear.
- It's OK, I'm only playing.

09:43.927 --> 09:46.361
That's Carly, my partner's girl.

09:46.407 --> 09:50.525
He's in Gibraltar on a bit of business, but a word
of warning - he's protective and she's...

09:50.567 --> 09:52.922
You know, just leave it at that, eh?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.246
Anyway,

09:55.287 --> 09:57.243
what are we gonna do with you, kid?

09:58.087 --> 10:00.555
I tell you what, there's a party at my bar tonight.

10:00.607 --> 10:02.916
- Do you wanna drive me?
- All right, yeah.

10:02.967 --> 10:07.245
I'll give you a few pesetas. Go and get yourself
some evening wear. Then pick me up.

10:07.287 --> 10:08.845
CARLY: Hey, Charlie.

10:11.687 --> 10:13.120
Who are you?

I'll speak to you later, sweetheart.

11:16.447 --> 11:20.042
Do you want a drink? You go and have a dance
and I'll bring it over to you.

11:20.087 --> 11:21.918
- I'll have a Babycham.
- All right.

11:21.967 --> 11:23.958

11:26.167 --> 11:27.964
Aye aye! Look at him, look.

- How are you going, son?
- I'm good, thanks, Ron.

12:02.087 --> 12:04.840
- I'm Ron.
- Listen, Danny's Ronnie's pal.

12:04.887 --> 12:06.957
Ronnie is Sammy's pal

12:07.007 --> 12:09.840
who's my partner who's down in Gibraltar
on a bit of business.

12:09.887 --> 12:10.956
Got it?

12:11.007 --> 12:13.077

- The blue.

FRANKIE: The story goes, Danny and Ronnie
were on the run for a robbery that went wrong.

12:22.007 --> 12:25.636
But their wives, Shirley and Nora,
were more aggressive than the Flying Squad

12:25.687 --> 12:27.279
and hunted them down on the coast.

Here we go, look at that!
Champagne for everyone.

Frankie, you got this, son?

12:34.767 --> 12:36.086
Who's that?

12:36.887 --> 12:38.115
That's the mayor.

12:38.167 --> 12:39.998
All right? Do you want a drink?

12:40.047 --> 12:41.844
He's the main man.

12:41.887 --> 12:44.685
Send him over some champagne, will you?
Good boy.

12:44.727 --> 12:45.921
Ha, ha!

12:57.367 --> 13:00.120
# Once I had love and it was a gas

13:01.527 --> 13:04.485

Frankie, are you still with us, kid?

13:09.007 --> 13:10.281
Yeah.

13:10.327 --> 13:13.842
Listen, why don't you stick around for a bit?

13:13.887 --> 13:15.923
We could do with a driver.

13:17.687 --> 13:18.915
Really?

13:18.967 --> 13:20.958
Yeah, why not?

13:21.007 --> 13:24.636
I'll stick you on the payroll
and put you in charge of the Merc.

13:26.167 --> 13:29.159
Not unless you've got to go back to England
for something?

13:30.127 --> 13:32.118
I don't know what to say, Charlie.

13:33.087 --> 13:35.078
Well, don't, then.

13:35.127 --> 13:37.436
I've gotta teach you how to drive, though.

13:42.327 --> 13:44.602
# SIMPLE MINDS: Don't You Forget About Me

13:44.647 --> 13:46.478
# Hey, hey

13:47.647 --> 13:50.400
# Oooh, ooh

13:58.007 --> 14:00.043
Now you try.

14:00.087 --> 14:03.363
# Won't you come see about me?

14:04.207 --> 14:07.005
# I'll be alone dancing...

14:07.047 --> 14:08.446
WOMAN: Hola.

14:08.487 --> 14:10.478
Two cervezas, please.

14:11.567 --> 14:14.161
I'd like to put you over this bar
and fuck you in the arse.

14:14.207 --> 14:15.196
¿Qué?

14:15.247 --> 14:16.396
#... inside and out

14:18.447 --> 14:20.597
# Slow change may pull us apart

14:22.207 --> 14:26.246
# When the light gets into your heart, baby

14:26.287 --> 14:28.198
# Don't you

14:29.447 --> 14:30.926
# Forget about me

14:32.527 --> 14:34.483
# Don't, don't, don't, don't...

14:34.527 --> 14:38.281
Two beers, please. I suppose sucking my cock's
out of the question?

14:38.327 --> 14:41.558
I suppose it is, seeing as my old man's
over there and he's a big cunt.

14:44.727 --> 14:48.083
# I say la, la, la, la...

14:54.447 --> 14:56.119
- ¿Dónde va? ¿Dónde va?
- What?

14:56.167 --> 14:58.522
- ¿Qué pasa contigo?
- Don't keep touching me.

14:58.567 --> 15:01.161
Fuck off inside, you're out of your depth!

15:01.207 --> 15:05.917
Keep your hands to yourself! What's the matter
with you? You served lunch on a dirty plate!

15:05.967 --> 15:07.958
Excuse me. Fuck off!

15:08.007 --> 15:09.884
Who the fuck is that?

15:09.927 --> 15:11.406
That's my partner, Sammy.

15:11.447 --> 15:14.166
Fuck off! Go on, then, do you want some?

15:14.207 --> 15:16.596
- Fuck off!
- ¿Sammy, cómo estás?

15:16.647 --> 15:17.636
Ha, ha!

15:19.247 --> 15:21.602
Quick! The sharks are gonna get you!

15:21.647 --> 15:24.241
Drop the steps. Come on, lively!

15:25.487 --> 15:27.478
Come on, boy. In you come.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.324
There he is! Ha, ha!

15:29.367 --> 15:30.641
Come on.

15:30.687 --> 15:33.155
Come on. Up you get, come on.

15:33.207 --> 15:34.560
Get up here.

15:36.167 --> 15:39.079
- Straight up. What happened?
- What a cunt, the geezer!

15:39.127 --> 15:42.324
FRANKIE: No surprises for guessing
which one he was in the robbery.

15:42.367 --> 15:45.245
The geezer was so hard,
even his nightmares were scared of him.

15:45.287 --> 15:47.960
What you do that for, you lunatic?
You've fucked us!

15:48.007 --> 15:50.077
We've gotta go on our fucking toes now.

15:50.127 --> 15:52.561
Well, good. I hate this fucking weather, anyway.

15:52.607 --> 15:56.759
FRANKIE: Sammy had been in Gibraltar
helping a flamenco singer called Carlos,

15:56.807 --> 15:59.401
who was being bullied
by some Dutch drug smugglers

15:59.447 --> 16:01.722
that were using his house by the sea
as a lookout

16:01.767 --> 16:04.122
to bring marijuana in from Morocco.

16:04.167 --> 16:06.317
# MARTHA AND THE MUFFINS: Echo Beach

16:06.367 --> 16:08.005
Everything's gonna be all right.

16:08.047 --> 16:10.561
If Charlie was the playboy,
Sammy was the businessman.

16:10.607 --> 16:13.326
And he knew if he had Carlos in his pocket,

16:13.367 --> 16:15.676
he could smuggle drugs from Africa himself.

16:15.727 --> 16:17.763
- Carry on, Charlie.
- IGillipollas!

16:17.807 --> 16:19.718
Hey, I said sorry. Now leave it.

16:19.767 --> 16:22.918
And drugs, unlike the waiter, were the future.

16:23.487 --> 16:26.923
# On a silent summer evening
the sky's alive with lights

16:28.567 --> 16:30.922
And that was Sammy, the partner.

16:30.967 --> 16:35.563
He was a bit like Robin Hood, apart from the fact
he robbed anyone and gave to himself,

16:35.607 --> 16:38.041
and probably killed their familiesjust for fun.

16:40.007 --> 16:41.326
Nice fellow, eh?

16:41.367 --> 16:42.880
Charming, don't you think?

16:42.927 --> 16:46.442
And from the moment he met me,
he fucking hated me.

16:46.487 --> 16:49.843
He was only trying to serve me lunch
on a dirty plate. You know what I'm like.

16:49.887 --> 16:52.606
- You will eat in low-end places, won't you?
- Low-end?

16:52.647 --> 16:56.925
They charge an absolute fucking fortune in
there. I should have glassed every one of 'em.

16:56.967 --> 16:59.640
Sammy, this is the Kid Frankie.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.006
He drives us now.

17:01.047 --> 17:02.400
Did you miss me?

17:02.447 --> 17:04.118
CHARLIE: Terribly.

17:04.166 --> 17:05.486
How was Gibraltar?

17:05.527 --> 17:08.121
Ream, Charl.
I've got this singer Carlos in our pocket.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.044
He's even coming down the club tonight.

17:10.087 --> 17:12.123
This little Dutch firm, they're finished.

17:12.166 --> 17:13.759
Carlos is ours.

17:13.807 --> 17:17.321
Do me a favour, go and sort yourself out
and tell me about it when we get home.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.198
You're bleeding over the fucking deck.

17:24.327 --> 17:26.761
# BUGGLES: Video Killed The Radio Star

17:26.807 --> 17:29.241
CHARLIE: #... killed the radio star

17:29.287 --> 17:31.084
# In my mind

17:31.127 --> 17:33.197
# And in my car

17:33.247 --> 17:36.045
# We can't rewind cos...
- Darling, it's horizontal strokes.

17:36.087 --> 17:38.840
Let me finish.
(Sings) Oh, oh-oh, oh

17:38.887 --> 17:40.445
I like that bit.

17:40.487 --> 17:43.559
- What was it?
- Horizontal strokes.

17:43.607 --> 17:44.926
Sorry.

17:49.447 --> 17:50.846
Listen, Charl.

17:50.887 --> 17:51.876
What?

17:53.847 --> 17:56.236
I really appreciate what you've done for me.

17:56.287 --> 17:58.357
- But...
(Sammy sings along to song)

17:59.447 --> 18:02.007
...maybe I should go now.
I don't wanna get in the way here.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.083
CHARLIE: It's all right, son. You're with me.

18:04.127 --> 18:06.243
I told you, don't worry about Sammy.

18:06.287 --> 18:08.084
He's wild, but he's got a good heart.

18:08.127 --> 18:11.676
Anyway, fuck all that bollocks.
There's a party down at the club tonight.

18:11.727 --> 18:13.319
I need you to drive us.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.403
That Dutch firm might show up.

18:18.767 --> 18:20.678
Wanna come for a swim, Frankie?

18:20.727 --> 18:22.445
#... broke your heart

18:22.487 --> 18:27.038
# Put the blame on VCR

18:30.407 --> 18:32.762
# You are

18:32.807 --> 18:35.367
# A radio star

18:37.087 --> 18:39.681
# You are

18:40.407 --> 18:42.398
# A radio star

18:44.607 --> 18:48.043
# Video killed the radio star

18:48.087 --> 18:50.555
I'm Carlos and I'm pleased to meet you.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.677
And you, Carlos.

18:52.727 --> 18:57.118
Sammy tells me you've got a little problem
we might be able to help you with.

18:57.167 --> 18:59.601
I'm hoping so, please.

18:59.647 --> 19:01.205
You're with us now, son.

19:01.247 --> 19:04.080
You ain't gotta worry
about them fucking Dutch mugs any more.

19:04.127 --> 19:06.118
We'll take care of that for you.

19:07.207 --> 19:08.356
I've gotta tell you,

19:08.407 --> 19:11.638
you look better on the LP covers
than you do in the flesh.

19:11.687 --> 19:14.360
What happened? You look fucked.

19:17.727 --> 19:19.604
Ah, los banderos ingleses.

19:19.647 --> 19:22.957
- What's he say?
- He said you are criminals from England.

19:23.007 --> 19:25.919
- Tell him to fuck off.
- No, no, no, whoa.

19:25.967 --> 19:26.956
No.

19:27.007 --> 19:29.396
Offer him some champagne.

19:29.447 --> 19:30.800
From us.

19:30.847 --> 19:32.599
Go on.

19:34.887 --> 19:37.196
CHARLIE: That's the mayor.

19:37.247 --> 19:39.807
- Looks like a fucking iron.
- He probably is.

19:39.847 --> 19:41.678
Ingleses,

19:41.727 --> 19:43.319
muchas gracias.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.517
CHARLIE: You're welcome.

19:49.047 --> 19:51.038
# A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS: I Ran

20:07.127 --> 20:08.799
Oh!

20:10.247 --> 20:11.885
Sammy, the Dutch are in the club.

20:11.927 --> 20:13.599
Danny, the Dutch are here. Let's go!

20:16.007 --> 20:17.759
Ronnie, they're here!

20:17.807 --> 20:19.035
Come on.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.166
Move it!

20:28.727 --> 20:30.604
Go and sit in the corner.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.444
We've got aggro, Charles. The Dutch.

20:36.287 --> 20:37.925
Charles, cop for it.

20:41.447 --> 20:43.278
# I walked along the avenue

20:44.727 --> 20:48.686
# I never thought I'd meet a girl like you

20:48.727 --> 20:52.402
# Meet a girl like you
- No. Not in here.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.045
# With auburn hair and tawny eyes

20:57.087 --> 21:01.877
# The kind of eyes that hypnotise me through

21:01.927 --> 21:04.395
# Hypnotise me through

21:06.127 --> 21:08.721
# And I ran

21:08.767 --> 21:12.043
# I ran so far away

21:12.967 --> 21:15.276
# I just ran

21:15.327 --> 21:18.364
# I ran all night and day

21:21.007 --> 21:22.838
FRANKIE: I wasn't that stupid.

21:22.887 --> 21:26.323
I knew the difference between right and wrong
and I knew I should have gone,

21:26.367 --> 21:27.641
right there and then.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.076
But as much as I was out of my depth,

21:30.127 --> 21:31.924
something kept pulling me back.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.320
Give us a kiss.

21:33.367 --> 21:35.483
Give us a kiss!

21:35.527 --> 21:37.722
Come here, boy.

21:43.687 --> 21:45.200
Put that out.

21:47.567 --> 21:48.966
Right, here are the rules.

21:49.007 --> 21:51.567
You take her shopping,
you let her get what she wants.

21:51.607 --> 21:53.996
You take her to lunch,
you let her eat what she wants.

21:54.047 --> 21:56.766
But you take her to a bar drinking
and that's when we fall out.

21:56.807 --> 22:00.243
I get back from Gibraltar and I find she's drunk,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

22:00.287 --> 22:01.800
We understand each other?

22:03.087 --> 22:06.204
And one last thing,
you even think about trying to get hold of her...

22:06.247 --> 22:08.477
Sammy, I'd never do that. She's your lady.

22:08.527 --> 22:11.963
All right. We'll be back just before sunset.

22:12.007 --> 22:13.884
OK. Good luck with the Dutch.

22:13.927 --> 22:16.646
Shut your mouth about the Dutch.
It's nothing to do with you.

22:16.687 --> 22:19.838
FRANKIE: While Sammy and Charlie went
to make a deal with the Dutch,

22:19.887 --> 22:21.366
I had to look after the snake.

22:21.407 --> 22:24.717
The way she fucked with people's heads,
I should have stayed in bed.

23:29.047 --> 23:31.686
- How are you supposed to drive me in that?
- Are you sober?

23:31.727 --> 23:33.558
Can I smell your breath?

23:33.607 --> 23:36.167
It's all right. Remember, you haven't had a drink.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.640
Maybe.

23:39.447 --> 23:41.642
Dirty fucking Dutch!

CHARLIE: Liberty-taking...

23:43.207 --> 23:44.606
Hi, darling.

23:44.647 --> 23:46.365
Hey, Charlie.

23:48.327 --> 23:51.603
- You seen what they've done to the Merc?
- What's happened to you?

23:51.647 --> 23:54.764
They've fucking shot the car to pieces,
that's what they've done.

23:54.807 --> 23:57.879
Get Danny and Ronnie and
tell them we need them at the club tonight.

23:57.927 --> 23:59.406
Oi!

23:59.447 --> 24:04.043
I said, get Danny and Ronnie and get yourself
back here. We need to check this lot's working.

24:04.087 --> 24:07.079
You're bleeding everywhere.
You'd better get up the hospital.

24:07.127 --> 24:11.006
- Five is a prime number, innit, Charl?
- Don't fucking drive me mad, Sam.

24:11.047 --> 24:13.686
It's half down to you that I've got this.
I asked you,

24:13.727 --> 24:16.002
what about the Dutch firm?

24:16.047 --> 24:18.561
Are they heavy? Do we do business with them?
No, not you.

24:18.607 --> 24:22.202
Not Sammy Brooks.
He wants to run around fucking killing people.

24:22.247 --> 24:25.125
What do you reckon, boys? Nice, eh?

24:25.167 --> 24:27.522
SAMMY: Not the espadrilles.
You need heels, babe.

24:27.567 --> 24:32.482
I'm obviously not gonna wear it
with fucking espadrilles. I was just showing you.

24:38.207 --> 24:39.879
- Sweet?
- Amazing.

24:39.927 --> 24:42.521
- Ain't nothing getting through these vests.
- Good.

24:42.567 --> 24:43.795
Try it on me.

24:43.847 --> 24:45.280
Yeah? How far?

24:45.327 --> 24:47.318
From about where you was.

24:48.887 --> 24:51.401
- Are you ready?
- Go on, then.

24:56.727 --> 24:58.206
Fuck!

24:59.127 --> 25:00.606
Any good?

25:01.687 --> 25:03.882
Fuck. Still here, ain't I?

25:07.247 --> 25:09.317
My turn, Charl. Use the shotgun.

25:09.367 --> 25:11.323
- Are you sure?
- Go on.

25:13.727 --> 25:15.160
Ready?

25:15.207 --> 25:16.322
Ready.

25:21.647 --> 25:23.524
Sammy?

25:24.647 --> 25:27.320
Sammy? Are you all right, son?

25:32.167 --> 25:34.761
Might start wearing one of these
all the time, Charl.

25:34.807 --> 25:37.685
You should do. It'll help you sleep better.

25:37.727 --> 25:40.446
It's like a kick up the bollocks, Charl.

25:46.487 --> 25:48.682
(Sammy laughs) It's a blinder.

25:50.207 --> 25:51.640
Here you are.

25:52.687 --> 25:54.279
You try it.

25:56.567 --> 25:57.716
What?

25:57.767 --> 25:59.758
Put the vest on.

25:59.807 --> 26:02.037
Sammy, what are you doing?

26:02.087 --> 26:03.759
What?

26:09.447 --> 26:10.721
Fuck.

26:16.327 --> 26:20.366
- This is fucking madness. I don't want to...
- Oh, shut up!

26:21.327 --> 26:22.760
(Laughs)

26:24.487 --> 26:26.205
Here, are you all right?

26:26.247 --> 26:27.566
Kid?

26:27.607 --> 26:29.962
Are you all right, son? Come on.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.321
Are you all right?

26:36.247 --> 26:37.566
Fucking liberty.

26:37.607 --> 26:39.199
- What?
- You know what.

26:39.247 --> 26:41.886
What do you mean? He's all right.

26:41.927 --> 26:44.839
Go on, stick him in the boot if he's moaning.
(Laughs)

26:51.687 --> 26:53.678
Don't worry, son. You'll live.

26:58.647 --> 27:00.956
What's the matter? You're off, ain't you?

27:03.367 --> 27:05.562
It's just that... I'm just...

27:05.607 --> 27:08.758
It's all right, don't worry.
You ain't gotta explain nothing to me.

27:08.807 --> 27:10.877
It's just, it ain't a bit of me, Charl.

27:10.927 --> 27:12.724
I ain't one of yous.

27:12.767 --> 27:14.485
Here, look, come here.

27:15.407 --> 27:17.204
Here, take it.

27:19.487 --> 27:22.399
Any time you want a holiday,
you come and see me, all right?

27:22.447 --> 27:24.438
Don't, don't worry about it.

27:24.487 --> 27:27.638
Don't worry about it. You just make sure
you come and see me again.

27:27.687 --> 27:30.201
You'll be all right, you know that, don't you?

27:30.247 --> 27:31.566
Am I?

27:32.447 --> 27:35.439
Course you fucking are. You've got character.

27:36.487 --> 27:39.797
Anyway, look, I've gotta go and sort out
these Dutch cunts.

27:39.847 --> 27:41.838
I'll see you later.

27:41.887 --> 27:43.445
Take care.

27:50.847 --> 27:52.200
Ta-ta.

28:54.287 --> 28:55.766
FRANKIE: The way I saw it,

28:55.807 --> 28:59.959
it was go back to London and wank my life away
playing Donkey Kong in the kebab house

29:00.007 --> 29:03.283
or sign up to a life of crime, women and drugs.

29:05.007 --> 29:07.316
What else was I gonna fucking do?

29:07.367 --> 29:09.358
# SHANNON: Let The Music Play

29:38.527 --> 29:40.518
# Let the music

29:42.687 --> 29:44.678
# Just to groove

29:46.967 --> 29:48.958
# Let the music

29:50.647 --> 29:52.478
# This groove again

29:52.527 --> 29:55.280
# No, no, once again now

29:55.327 --> 29:56.965
# Let the music

29:57.007 --> 29:58.998
(Speaks Dutch)

30:01.647 --> 30:03.638
# He'll come back

30:39.727 --> 30:43.083
FRANKIE: It's eight miles straight across
from Morocco to Gibraltar.

30:43.127 --> 30:46.642
Every night, we had one chance when
the Navy patrol boats were far enough apart

30:46.687 --> 30:49.724
for us to sneak our dinghies full of drugs
through the middle.

30:49.767 --> 30:51.564
And it weren't easy, our line of work.

30:51.607 --> 30:55.316
Cos you had to get up around five, have some
paella, if you're lucky, a bit of shrimp,

30:55.367 --> 30:56.595
then wait for night.

30:56.647 --> 30:59.605
We prayed for clouds
so they could give us that extra bit of cover.

30:59.647 --> 31:02.639
Even then, Sammy was the only one
that made the call.

31:02.687 --> 31:05.281
Sometimes we misjudged the timings
of the patrol boats.

31:05.327 --> 31:06.840
(Captain barks order)

31:06.887 --> 31:10.926
And as I wiped Moroccan kids'brains off me,
I questioned my morals.

31:10.967 --> 31:14.198
But with the amount of money at stake
and Sammy breathing down my neck,

31:14.247 --> 31:16.477
there was no time for regret.

31:16.527 --> 31:19.200
It ain't good news. We've lost a few of 'em.

31:21.367 --> 31:23.164
Oh, well, you live and learn.

31:23.207 --> 31:25.038
Unless you're a dead kid.

31:25.087 --> 31:27.806
It was Danny and Ronnie'sjob to get the puff
from the dealers,

31:27.847 --> 31:32.204
load up the boats with the barrels and make
sure the mules headed in the right direction.

31:32.247 --> 31:35.159
Unless it was Ramadan.
Fucking Holy Month costs us fortunes,

31:35.207 --> 31:37.243
because parents wouldn't let their kids go,

31:37.287 --> 31:39.323
even when we doubled their carry money.

31:39.367 --> 31:41.756
But we got round it. We went to the orphanages.

31:41.807 --> 31:45.117
Sammy was the eye in the sky
and everything went on his order.

31:45.167 --> 31:47.920
He was the only one
that could give the green light.

31:47.967 --> 31:50.037
Me and Charlie were on beach patrol.

31:50.087 --> 31:53.159
It was ourjob to make sure
the kids didn't run off with our drugs.

31:53.207 --> 31:56.517
They're thieving cunts, Moroccans,
it's in their blood.

31:56.567 --> 32:00.879
So we'd grab 'em out the dinghies, sling 'em
in the back of our van before they could run off,

32:00.927 --> 32:05.717
then we'd drive into the Linea, switch lorries
and send the puff off to Madrid to be sealed.

32:07.127 --> 32:09.357
SAMMY: The bath is empty. I repeat,

32:09.407 --> 32:11.284
the bath is empty.

32:11.327 --> 32:13.443
- Go! Go!
# Shooting stars never stop

32:14.727 --> 32:16.399
- Go!
# Even when they reach the top

32:16.447 --> 32:18.915
# Shooting stars never stop

32:18.967 --> 32:20.685
# Even when they reach the top

32:20.727 --> 32:22.558
# There goes a supernova

32:22.607 --> 32:24.518
# What a pushover

32:24.567 --> 32:26.956
# There goes a supernova

32:27.007 --> 32:28.884
# What a pushover

32:28.927 --> 32:30.440
# Yeah

32:37.487 --> 32:40.240
- Come on, then, you little fucking pikeys!
- Come on!

32:43.847 --> 32:45.075
Come on, venga! Venga!

32:45.127 --> 32:47.687
# We're a long way from home

32:47.727 --> 32:52.118
With the Dutch out the way, we changed
the way drugs were smuggled into England.

32:52.167 --> 32:55.079
We slashed the prices
and drove them through the Continent.

32:55.127 --> 32:58.244
Our operation grew so big,
I was bringing my mates down to help.

32:58.287 --> 33:01.836
I lived to regret it cos, like Moroccans,
South Londoners are thieving cunts

33:01.887 --> 33:03.923
and couldn't keep their hands to themselves.

33:03.967 --> 33:05.116
Fuck Frankie!

33:05.167 --> 33:08.159
And the ginger cunt.
He looks like Ronald Mc-fucking-Donald.

33:13.887 --> 33:17.721
You shoot your mate in the foot, you can go.
If not, Ronnie'll shoot you in the foot.

33:17.767 --> 33:21.043
Sam, please, I can't shoot him,
he's my fucking pal.

33:21.087 --> 33:23.760
- Ronnie!
- All right, all right.

33:23.807 --> 33:26.241
Leave it out, Dan.
I've known you since I was five.

33:30.287 --> 33:32.801
Fucking hell. I'm sorry, mate, I've gotta do it

33:32.847 --> 33:34.758
or I'm gonna get fucking shot.

33:34.807 --> 33:36.843
Look what you made me do.

33:37.887 --> 33:39.639
Sorry, mate.

33:40.607 --> 33:41.801
Argh! Fuck!

33:44.127 --> 33:45.879
Oh, fuck.

33:47.367 --> 33:49.278
Ronnie!

33:49.327 --> 33:52.160
Leave it out, Sam. They're kids.

33:54.367 --> 33:55.925
Argh!

33:57.087 --> 33:58.725
Fucking hell!

34:02.847 --> 34:04.246
And you,

34:04.287 --> 34:08.166
you'd get one right through the fucking nut
if you wasn't Charlie's boy.

34:08.206 --> 34:10.846
FRANKIE: The funny thing was,
as my life got bigger,

34:10.887 --> 34:12.478
my world got smaller.

34:12.527 --> 34:15.837
The more money we made,
the less time we spent enjoying it.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.764
Sammy cut away anyone he didn't need.

34:17.806 --> 34:20.161
Every day above ground
was a result around him.

34:20.206 --> 34:23.040
No-one was safe. I'm telling you, fucking no-one.

34:23.087 --> 34:25.840
Sam, there's a geezer out front
wants to see you.

34:25.887 --> 34:27.842
Who is it?

34:27.887 --> 34:29.639
One of the mayor's lot.

34:38.087 --> 34:40.681
Hello, English. How are you?

34:40.726 --> 34:43.002
What do you fucking want?

34:44.367 --> 34:47.803
The mayor is having a dinner party
at his residence this evening.

34:47.847 --> 34:50.281
He has requested your company.

34:50.327 --> 34:51.965
What for?

34:52.007 --> 34:53.998
That's between you and him.

34:55.887 --> 34:57.957
A party, eh?

34:58.007 --> 34:59.998
We expect you at six.

35:00.047 --> 35:01.844
It's glamorous casual.

35:01.887 --> 35:05.562
CHARLIE: Tell your man we'll be there.
- OK.

35:05.607 --> 35:07.598
I tell my man you'll be there.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.638
Whatever. Come on.

35:11.567 --> 35:13.683
Listen, we can't exactly blank him.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.045
We'll make a night of it.

35:16.087 --> 35:20.239
- What's fucking glamorous casuals, anyway?
- I'd better dust my tux off, eh?

35:20.287 --> 35:22.323
What for?

35:22.367 --> 35:23.561
For the party.

35:23.607 --> 35:25.598
No need to bother, Dan.

35:25.647 --> 35:28.957
RONNIE: Oh, yeah, Sam? Why's that?

35:29.007 --> 35:30.998
What do you think, Ron?

35:31.887 --> 35:34.082
What's that mean? You dropping us?

35:34.127 --> 35:37.164
No-one's dropping anyone.
But some things are for us only.

35:37.207 --> 35:40.085
- All right?
- I thought we were all partners.

35:40.127 --> 35:44.086
Well, we fucking well ain't partners, Ron.
You and your pal are on the payroll.

35:44.127 --> 35:46.402
So don't start getting fucking lemon.

35:46.447 --> 35:49.996
CHARLIE: There was never talk of partnerships.
You both fucking knew the deal

35:50.047 --> 35:51.526
and we've looked after you.

35:51.567 --> 35:54.320
Sammy, are you fucking winding us up?

35:55.607 --> 35:57.882
No, I'm not winding you up, Ron.

36:00.087 --> 36:01.805
DANNY: Ronnie, come on.

36:01.847 --> 36:03.360
Let's go.

36:10.607 --> 36:14.122
- What do you reckon?
- Fuck 'em. They're gonna have to swallow.

36:18.447 --> 36:21.519
Listen, Frank, this ain't like the real world.

36:21.567 --> 36:24.718
Every cunt on this coast is your pal
when you're looking after 'em.

36:24.767 --> 36:26.439
The next day, they wanna fuck you,

36:26.487 --> 36:28.876
and the day after that,
they wanna be your pal again.

36:28.927 --> 36:30.918
It's a fucking dog business.

36:31.687 --> 36:33.439
What about you?

36:33.487 --> 36:34.522
Me?

36:34.567 --> 36:36.046
I'm different.

36:42.847 --> 36:45.566
Fucking hell, kid. This is where you wanna be.

36:45.607 --> 36:47.837
Three years, this'll be mine.

36:47.887 --> 36:49.445
Nice gun.

36:49.487 --> 36:52.797
CHARLIE: Tell the mayor
he's got a fantastic place here.

36:52.847 --> 36:55.077
Ask him if we can rent one of the wings.

36:56.767 --> 37:01.124
Le gusta tu casa.
Dice que, "Es posible arrendar un ala aquí?"

37:01.167 --> 37:02.486
(Laughs)

37:04.127 --> 37:06.038
Lo primero que me interesa saber

37:06.087 --> 37:09.557
es qué es lo que están trayendo
en los botes aquellos?

37:09.607 --> 37:11.325
CHARLIE: What's he say?

37:11.367 --> 37:13.358
He said, "Thank you."

37:13.407 --> 37:14.681
And?

37:14.727 --> 37:17.560
He would like to know
what are you bringing on the boats?

37:18.887 --> 37:20.525
What boats?

37:20.567 --> 37:22.000
HENCHMAN: Dice, "Qué botes?"

37:22.047 --> 37:27.804
MAYOR: Dile que, en este mundo, todo
se puede arreglar si uno conoce la gente clave.

37:27.847 --> 37:31.635
HENCHMAN: He say anything is possible
if you know the right people.

37:34.167 --> 37:35.964
Amigos?

37:37.487 --> 37:39.000
Amigos.

37:39.047 --> 37:40.241
OK.

37:42.007 --> 37:45.079
Una cosa más. Y es muy importante.

37:46.367 --> 37:48.358
Con la coca, no.

37:49.167 --> 37:52.000
Marijuana, ningún problema.
Siguen trayendola, bueno.

37:52.047 --> 37:54.003
Pero, si con la coca, hay problema.

37:54.047 --> 37:56.083
HENCHMAN: There is one thing you must know.

37:56.127 --> 37:58.163
The cocaine.

37:58.207 --> 38:00.437
You must never bring it onto his coast.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.637
The marijuana is OK.

38:02.687 --> 38:04.962
But if you sell the cocaine, it is a problem.

38:05.007 --> 38:07.202
And if there is a problem,

38:07.247 --> 38:08.919
you lose.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.245
Buenos amigos, eh?

38:11.287 --> 38:13.164
Amigos.

38:15.967 --> 38:18.845
MAYOR: Ese chico
me lo sientan al lado para la cena?

38:18.887 --> 38:21.481
He's saying he would like
to sit next to you for dinner.

38:24.207 --> 38:26.437
Tell him it's OK.

38:26.487 --> 38:28.205
# DAVID BOWIE: Modern Love

38:31.447 --> 38:33.165
# I know when to go out

38:34.087 --> 38:36.601
# I know when to stay in

38:36.647 --> 38:37.966
# Get things done

38:42.127 --> 38:45.164
# I catch the paperboy

38:45.207 --> 38:47.118
# But things don't really change

38:47.167 --> 38:49.840
# I'm standing in the wind...

38:51.007 --> 38:52.679
What do you reckon?

38:55.287 --> 38:57.278
- Oi-oi!
- Wahay!

39:03.527 --> 39:06.041
# Never gonna fall for modern love

39:06.087 --> 39:08.760
# Walks beside me
# Modern love

39:08.807 --> 39:10.479
# Walks on by

39:10.527 --> 39:13.724
- I think we should knock down that wall, darling.
- Whatever you want.

39:13.767 --> 39:15.803
Get rid of all that Spanishified shit.

39:15.847 --> 39:18.156
I want red, black and chrome everywhere.

39:18.207 --> 39:21.165
See that terracotta? It's gotta go.
I want marble throughout.

39:21.207 --> 39:23.846
- My gun cabinet?
- Can't you put them under the bed?

39:23.887 --> 39:25.479
#... God and man

39:25.527 --> 39:27.279
# God and man

# No confessions
# God and man

39:29.687 --> 39:32.406
# No religion
# God and man

39:32.447 --> 39:33.960
# Don't believe in...

39:34.007 --> 39:35.645
SAMMY: That should take care of it.

39:35.687 --> 39:37.598
Now fuck off out of my house.

39:37.647 --> 39:39.046
He means it.

39:39.087 --> 39:42.716
Now, be careful, there's a day's money in there.
Go on.

39:42.767 --> 39:45.156
And keep the change, you Toby.

39:56.607 --> 39:58.518
CHARLIE: Oooh! Ha, ha!

39:58.567 --> 40:01.320
- I think that was out, Charl.
- Sammy, it was in.

40:01.367 --> 40:03.642
- No, that's... Carl?
- Ace.

40:03.687 --> 40:04.915
(Charlie laughs)

40:05.807 --> 40:07.365
- No, it was out, Charl.
- It was in.

40:07.407 --> 40:09.841
It was fucking out! Don't fucking cheat!

40:09.887 --> 40:12.003
- Cunt.
CHARLIE: Sammy, it was in!

40:12.047 --> 40:13.446
SAMMY: I ain't playing, Charl.

40:13.487 --> 40:16.604
CHARLIE: Oi!
- I ain't playing no more, Charlie. And you.

40:16.647 --> 40:18.399
CHARLIE: You sad fuck.

40:18.447 --> 40:19.675
Come on, mate.

40:21.807 --> 40:24.719
# Never gonna fall for
# Modern love

40:24.767 --> 40:26.962
# Walks beside me
# Modern love

40:27.007 --> 40:30.238
# Walks on by
# Modern love

40:30.287 --> 40:33.962
# Gets me to the church on time

40:34.007 --> 40:35.076
# Church on time

40:35.127 --> 40:37.357
# Terrifies me
# Church on time

40:39.807 --> 40:41.559
# Puts my trust in God...

40:41.607 --> 40:44.838
FRANKIE: With the mayor on our side,
we fucking smashed it.

40:44.887 --> 40:47.879
As long as we wet his beak
and stayed away from cocaine, he loved us.

40:47.927 --> 40:52.125
While the English police sat around scratching
their canisters wondering how we did it,

40:52.167 --> 40:55.443
we opened the club for Sunday lunch,
sat back and enjoyed our roast.

40:55.487 --> 40:57.523
IHola! Magazine.

41:07.927 --> 41:09.804
Leave off, Sam, please.

41:09.847 --> 41:12.680
DANNY: We only wanna have
a bit of roast dinner.

41:12.727 --> 41:15.002
We don't know
what we're supposed to have done.

41:15.047 --> 41:16.400
Sammy, come on, it's Sunday.

41:16.447 --> 41:19.757
- Fuck 'em, Charl, they're not welcome.
- Come on, Sammy, sit down.

41:19.807 --> 41:20.876
Come on.

41:26.367 --> 41:27.516
It's all right, lads.

41:27.567 --> 41:30.843
- Sit down, enjoy your dinner.
- Don't worry about him. Come on, sit down.

41:30.887 --> 41:33.003
Come on.

41:41.607 --> 41:43.438
Oh, here we go.

41:43.487 --> 41:45.398
Oh, look at it.

41:45.447 --> 41:46.596
Cunt.

41:46.647 --> 41:48.319
Ain't got a bit of class.

41:48.367 --> 41:51.165
SHIRLEY: Thinks it's the bollocks
cos its old man's warm.

41:51.207 --> 41:52.640
I think she's lovely.

41:52.687 --> 41:54.678
- You're just jealous.
- Fuck off!

41:54.727 --> 41:58.003
- Shut up. What do you know? It's just a brass.
- That's rich.

41:58.887 --> 42:01.003
Charlie, Frankie, come here.

42:01.047 --> 42:02.560
Come here.

42:05.247 --> 42:07.363
I'd give a grand to fuck you, boy.

42:08.287 --> 42:12.360
FRANKIE: If you thought that was bad,
it was nothing compared to what the chef said.

42:12.407 --> 42:15.285
- We've run out of lamb.
- You're joking?

42:15.327 --> 42:17.363
# TALK TALK: It's My Life

42:18.847 --> 42:20.565
# I've asked myself

42:20.607 --> 42:22.802
# How much do you...

42:22.847 --> 42:24.166
(Cheering)

42:26.247 --> 42:28.238
#... commit yourself?

42:32.127 --> 42:34.118
# Don't you forget

42:35.767 --> 42:37.997
# Caught in the crowd

42:40.047 --> 42:41.799
# It never ends

42:43.247 --> 42:45.442
FRANKIE: Come here. Charl.

42:45.487 --> 42:47.364
- What?
- See the state of these feet.

42:47.407 --> 42:48.840
Come here.

42:49.607 --> 42:51.165
- Go on, girls!
- (Laughs)

42:51.207 --> 42:53.198
(Singing and whooping)

42:54.447 --> 42:55.675
CHARLIE: Wahay!

42:58.607 --> 43:00.404
Come on, Ronnie!

43:01.247 --> 43:03.966
Here, you wanna sort your old woman out!

43:05.127 --> 43:07.482
# Two potato, three potato, four

43:07.527 --> 43:09.040
# Five potato, six potato

43:13.327 --> 43:16.046
CHARLIE: Go on, love, give it the old... (Laughs)

43:21.007 --> 43:21.996
Wahay!

43:53.567 --> 43:54.761
(Knocks)

43:59.287 --> 44:01.278
(Door opens)

44:02.767 --> 44:04.200
Hi, Charlie.

44:06.007 --> 44:07.360
How is he?

44:08.167 --> 44:09.839
Please don't blow him out.

44:34.407 --> 44:36.398
SAMMY: You all right, mate?

44:37.287 --> 44:38.686
CHARLIE: Yeah. You?

44:40.647 --> 44:42.638
SAMMY: Like my pool?

44:42.687 --> 44:44.518
CHARLIE: Yeah, it's lovely.

44:46.207 --> 44:48.198
What are we gonna do, Charl?

44:49.567 --> 44:52.035
- Can we just wipe our mouth and move on?
- No.

44:53.007 --> 44:55.282
I can't just wipe my mouth.

44:55.327 --> 44:57.318
Listen, Sam,

44:57.367 --> 44:59.881
you got Carly, you got your place up here.

44:59.927 --> 45:02.043
We're moving in different directions now.

45:02.087 --> 45:04.078
What's that supposed to mean?

45:04.127 --> 45:06.482
It means I wanna do my own thing for a while,

45:06.527 --> 45:08.961
see how it goes.

45:09.007 --> 45:11.805
Just cos I nicked your watch for a fucking laugh?

45:11.847 --> 45:13.678
It's not a fucking laugh, Sam.

45:14.887 --> 45:17.196
You planted it on Frankie and he's my mate.

45:17.247 --> 45:20.796
Well, you've only known that cunt five minutes.

45:20.847 --> 45:23.236
I've known you all my fucking life, Charl.

45:23.287 --> 45:25.676
Don't make this difficult, Sam.

45:25.727 --> 45:29.402
I'll still be about.
I just wanna do my own thing for a bit.

45:31.727 --> 45:34.116
Don't give me them eyes.

45:38.527 --> 45:41.803
FRANKIE: The good thing about drugs is
they make you feel good.

45:41.847 --> 45:45.123
The bad thing about drugs is
they make you greedy.

45:45.167 --> 45:47.158
# THE KNACK: My Sharona

45:48.007 --> 45:50.157
FRANKIE: What is it?
CHARLIE: The future.

45:50.207 --> 45:52.163
FRANKIE: Cocaine.
CHARLIE: Pure.

45:52.207 --> 45:55.040
FRANKIE: What about the mayor?
CHARLIE: Fuck the mayor.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.123
What do you reckon, kid? Good buzz?

45:58.167 --> 46:01.159
Fantastic. My cock's shrunk
and I can't feel my neck.

46:01.207 --> 46:02.845
What's the plan?

46:02.887 --> 46:05.959
Well, I've got the Colombians sweet,
I've got the pilots sweet,

46:06.007 --> 46:07.520
I've got the drop zone sweet.

46:07.567 --> 46:10.081
Now all we need to do
is get the fucking mayor sweet.

46:10.127 --> 46:12.322
Come on, kid, think. This is worth fortunes.

46:16.287 --> 46:18.164
How about we stick someone into the mayor?

46:18.207 --> 46:20.596
- A sacrifice.
- Who's gonna do that?

46:20.647 --> 46:25.198
Think about it. He likes boys. My mate Sonny,
a right skaghead in London, right,

46:25.247 --> 46:27.397
absolute fucking heroin addict.

46:27.447 --> 46:31.201
You know what they're like when they're
clucking. They'll do anything for a fix.

46:31.247 --> 46:33.522
- Exactly.
- Can he be got?

46:33.567 --> 46:35.876
FRANKIE: What a fucking amazing plan, eh?

46:35.927 --> 46:38.680
Cocaine junkie rent boys and a corrupt mayor.

46:38.727 --> 46:40.479
And this is how it was gonna work.

46:40.527 --> 46:44.122
Flying the white from Colombia
straight to London was too hot by now.

46:44.167 --> 46:48.843
So the South Americans had more produce
than they could shift. That's where we came in.

46:48.887 --> 46:52.402
They'd fly it as far as Morocco
and, from there, we'd switch planes

46:52.447 --> 46:55.166
and run it across the Gibraltar Straits like before.

46:58.647 --> 47:00.478
# M-M-My Sharona

47:00.527 --> 47:02.518
But it weren't like marijuana.

47:02.567 --> 47:05.445
We couldn't afford to lose one package.
It was worth too much.

47:05.487 --> 47:08.206
But if our sacrifice worked
and we kept the mayor sweet...

47:10.727 --> 47:13.685
...we'd wind up with more money
than we could dream of.

47:14.087 --> 47:17.124
Ah, I'm so pleased
you invited me down here, Frankie.

47:17.167 --> 47:20.477
- I don't know how I'll be able to repay you.
- I'm sure you'll find a way.

47:20.527 --> 47:22.518
So, what was it you said you wanted me to do?

47:22.567 --> 47:24.558
Oh, just meet some fella.

47:24.607 --> 47:28.646
- What's he buying?
- A bit of this, son, a bit of that.

47:28.687 --> 47:30.405
Usual stuff.

47:30.447 --> 47:33.325
Sweet. You know, I'm so glad I'm clean again,

47:33.367 --> 47:36.677
otherwise I'd be in a squat in Peckham
with a needle hanging out my arm.

47:36.727 --> 47:40.003
Clean? I thought you said
he was bang in trouble, you cunt.

47:40.047 --> 47:42.607
Fuck it. We'll get him drunk.

47:44.127 --> 47:45.845
Give us my Wilson.

47:45.887 --> 47:48.276
- What's that?
- A putter.

47:49.087 --> 47:50.566
Ow! Fuck!

47:50.607 --> 47:52.563
Sorry, I'm a bit rusty.

47:52.607 --> 47:55.565
I see it didn't take you long
to buck up with your mates again.

47:55.607 --> 47:57.245
Well, no-one else wanted me.

47:57.287 --> 48:00.404
Seeing as me and Ronnie are old pals
and went to school together,

48:00.447 --> 48:03.041
it seemed stupid to fall out
over something so silly.

48:03.087 --> 48:05.885
- Why don't you fucking grow up, Sam?
- I wish I could, Charl.

48:05.927 --> 48:08.236
- How are you two doing, anyway?
- Yeah, not bad.

48:08.287 --> 48:11.006
- Just brushing up with my irons.
- It looks that way.

48:11.047 --> 48:15.006
CHARLIE: Here, can't you find
your own fucking club to play in?

48:15.047 --> 48:17.766
- I'm a member.
- Hark at it. It talks.

48:17.807 --> 48:19.718
- That's what they say about you.
- Yeah?

48:19.767 --> 48:22.281
It's a bit strong, innit,
coming from a known grass?

48:22.327 --> 48:23.760
Fucking grass?

48:23.807 --> 48:25.126
Who did you get that from?

48:25.167 --> 48:27.806
- Danny.
- How come you've never done any bird, then?

48:27.847 --> 48:29.883
Cos I'm sensible, prick.

48:29.927 --> 48:32.077
Talking of pricks, how are you doing, Frankie?

48:32.127 --> 48:34.516
- All right, boys?
- All right, Carl?

48:35.647 --> 48:37.763
- How are you, darling?
- All right, Frankie.

48:37.807 --> 48:40.116
- How are you?
- Shut up, you slag.

48:40.167 --> 48:43.364
Fuck off, Sammy. Don't try and make
a fool of me in front of your mates.

48:53.327 --> 48:54.806
Birdie.

48:58.047 --> 49:00.356
FRANKIE: We had more coke
than we could handle.

49:00.407 --> 49:03.046
The more we sent back home,
the more they wanted it.

49:03.087 --> 49:07.000
And by 1987, London was covered
in a white blanket.

49:07.047 --> 49:08.719
Every fucking one was at it.

49:08.767 --> 49:10.883
From city boys to rent boys,

49:10.927 --> 49:12.963
yuppie girls to call girls.

49:13.007 --> 49:17.364
There were even stories of the Royals getting
stuck in, banging it up their fucking toffee noses.

49:17.407 --> 49:19.557
Maybe that's why she called her son Charlie.

49:19.607 --> 49:22.724
And how do you think she survived
on four hours'sleep a night?

49:22.767 --> 49:25.839
In our own little way,
we were shaping the future of our country.

49:25.887 --> 49:27.923
After cocaine, it would never be the same.

49:27.967 --> 49:31.846
It brought us together, pulled us apart,
made us sell our souls as well as our mates.

49:31.887 --> 49:33.240
It was a glorious time.

49:33.287 --> 49:35.403
#... for the touch of the younger kind

49:35.447 --> 49:37.199
# My, my, my

49:37.247 --> 49:38.680
# Aye, aye

49:38.727 --> 49:39.796
# Whoa!

49:42.327 --> 49:45.285
And as long as we kept this old bastard happy
and Sonny did hisjob,

49:45.327 --> 49:46.999
it was never gonna end.

49:47.047 --> 49:49.003
He say you have the face of a film star.

49:49.047 --> 49:51.515
Well, tell him, I said thanks.

49:51.567 --> 49:56.561
And I've actually been thinking
about getting into acting when I get home.

49:56.607 --> 49:58.643
HENCHMAN:
Dice que gustaría ser un actor.

49:58.687 --> 50:00.086
Fantástico!

50:01.807 --> 50:05.243
Dile que si quiere ser un actor,
yo tengo algo que mostrarle.

50:06.807 --> 50:07.922
He say...

50:07.967 --> 50:09.446
if you want to be an actor,

50:09.487 --> 50:11.682
he has something to show you.

50:11.727 --> 50:13.080
Yeah?

50:14.007 --> 50:16.646
- (Laughs)
- Come on, toilet. Come on.

50:25.847 --> 50:27.803
I fucking love them Colombians!

50:27.847 --> 50:29.883
I thought it'd be a fucking bag, wouldn't you?

50:29.927 --> 50:31.599
- What for?
- Fucking old knob.

50:31.647 --> 50:33.000
Fuck him. Come on.

50:33.047 --> 50:35.163
It's still welcome. Fuck that.

50:43.567 --> 50:44.966
Hey!

50:45.007 --> 50:46.076
Chico.

50:46.127 --> 50:47.401
Amigos.

50:47.447 --> 50:50.120
Yeah, mate. Amigos.

50:52.887 --> 50:54.525
Amigos, huh?

51:03.047 --> 51:04.321
Argh!

51:04.367 --> 51:06.039
Hijo de puta! Cabrón!

51:06.087 --> 51:08.999
- Hijo de puta!
- Fucking hell, that was quick.

51:12.367 --> 51:14.358
Jesus, Sonny, what did you do to him?

51:14.407 --> 51:17.285
He whipped his cock out,
so I done him in the arse.

51:18.127 --> 51:20.436
Good boy. Did he like it?

51:20.487 --> 51:23.763
I don't know. Do you want me to stick it in yours
and you can find out?

51:23.807 --> 51:25.798
No. No, you're all right, mate.

51:25.847 --> 51:29.203
I'd do anyone that wants to know.

51:30.007 --> 51:31.998
# ROXY MUSIC: Avalon

51:38.287 --> 51:41.279
# Now the party's over

51:41.327 --> 51:44.558
# I'm so tired

51:45.607 --> 51:47.199
# Then I see you coming...

51:50.047 --> 51:53.960
I'm gonna fuck you so good, you'll be buying me
diamonds from Cartier by the morning.

51:54.007 --> 51:56.646
FRANKIE: But as much as I wanted to,
I couldn't.

51:56.687 --> 51:59.155
It was the one thing I swore I'd never do.

51:59.207 --> 52:00.879
# Avalon

52:05.967 --> 52:08.037
# Avalon

52:13.527 --> 52:14.676
# Avalon

52:16.247 --> 52:18.397
Everybody knows who you are back in London.

52:18.447 --> 52:21.439
They couldn't believe it when I said
I was coming to do work for you.

52:21.487 --> 52:23.205
Good for you, son.

52:23.247 --> 52:24.760
No, I'm all right.

52:24.807 --> 52:27.196
Everyone's talking about your bar.

52:27.247 --> 52:30.956
It's like Charlie's Bar this, Charlie's Bar that.
They love it back in Peckham.

52:31.007 --> 52:32.998
One day, I'm gonna have a bar like yours.

52:33.047 --> 52:36.278
I'm gonna do it up like Peppermint Park,
get all my mates down...

52:36.327 --> 52:39.922
Shut up, Sonny, for fuck's sakes!
You're doing my swede in.

52:39.967 --> 52:42.117
The playground is full. Fly by, fly by.

52:46.927 --> 52:48.280
Charlie.

52:48.327 --> 52:51.125
Qué hace con este chulo de mierda
en este huerto?

52:51.167 --> 52:54.955
He says, "What are you doing
hanging around in the orange groves

52:55.007 --> 52:57.043
with this vicious little cunt?"

52:58.967 --> 53:02.198
What does it look like? I'm having a stroll.

53:06.967 --> 53:08.844
Dice que un paseo.

53:10.767 --> 53:12.678
- Cocaína.
- He say...

53:12.727 --> 53:14.683
- I know what he said.
- Ya te lo dije antes.

53:14.727 --> 53:19.596
Si quiere jugar bandero en buena parte,
aquí no. En mi territorio, no.

53:19.647 --> 53:22.480
Porque es un problema, y problema serio, eh?

53:22.527 --> 53:25.997
He warn you that
if you want to play Wild West on his coast...

53:27.087 --> 53:28.361
...it is a problem.

53:28.407 --> 53:29.806
So, ask him what he wants.

53:31.127 --> 53:32.799
(Whispers)

53:32.847 --> 53:35.919
Come on, hurry up, for fuck's sakes.
I'm getting sunburn.

53:37.727 --> 53:40.799
- He says he wants nothing.
- Good. That's that, then.

53:41.927 --> 53:43.758
Hey, ingleses.

53:44.527 --> 53:46.279
There is problem.

53:47.207 --> 53:49.198
Yeah, whatever.

53:49.247 --> 53:51.442
Jules. Come on, boy.

53:54.847 --> 53:58.999
Please stay with me tonight. I can't bear
to go back to him after being with you.

54:00.207 --> 54:02.084
I wish I could.

54:02.127 --> 54:04.322
I've gotta go meet these fucking Colombians.

54:04.367 --> 54:06.358
What for? Can't it wait?

54:06.407 --> 54:08.557
Baby, if I could get out of it, I would.

54:08.607 --> 54:12.236
Do you really think I wanna be standing
on a hillside near Estepona all night?

54:13.407 --> 54:15.079
What time are you meeting them?

54:16.447 --> 54:18.165
Can't you come after that?

54:18.207 --> 54:20.323
It's not till sunset.

54:20.367 --> 54:22.085
I'll try and come and see you after.

54:22.127 --> 54:24.721
- Good boy.
- Listen to me.

54:24.767 --> 54:26.758
This is our secret, all right?

54:27.887 --> 54:30.037
If Charlie finds out, he'll fucking kill me.

54:31.247 --> 54:32.600
Our secret.

54:36.007 --> 54:37.998
(lnhales deeply)

54:39.247 --> 54:41.238
You're unbelievable.

54:46.407 --> 54:48.125
Where the fucking hell have you been?

54:48.167 --> 54:50.362
You were meant to be
at the drop zone an hour ago.

54:50.407 --> 54:52.682
What have you been doing?
Sipping that shit?

54:52.727 --> 54:55.924
- Oh, and you ain't?
- Get out my fucking chair!

54:59.487 --> 55:01.637
What's that smell?

55:01.687 --> 55:04.440
- Smells like perfume.
FRANKIE: Shut up, Son!

55:04.487 --> 55:06.000
No-one asked you.

55:06.047 --> 55:10.563
- It is fucking perfume. Who's been here?
- It's mosquito spray. They're everywhere.

55:13.927 --> 55:16.805
- That fucking mayor's on us!
- Why? Where did you see him?

55:16.847 --> 55:21.284
Listen, we've gotta keep the Colombians sweet,
otherwise they'll fuck us off!

55:21.327 --> 55:22.919
We don't wanna fall out with them.

55:22.967 --> 55:25.162
All right. I'll speak to 'em.

55:25.207 --> 55:29.325
No, I'll fucking speak to 'em.
It's better coming from me.

55:29.367 --> 55:30.959
Really?

55:31.007 --> 55:33.157
Maybe you should take it easy with that, Charl.

55:33.207 --> 55:35.880
Don't fucking tell me what I can and can't do.

55:35.927 --> 55:38.316
You're only where you are
cos I fucking put you there.

55:38.367 --> 55:40.676
Now get your coat.
We've gotta go and sort this out.

55:40.727 --> 55:41.842
Move!

55:51.767 --> 55:53.883
Fancy a game of Pacman, Frank?

55:54.647 --> 55:56.638
# OMD: Maid Of Orleans

56:17.807 --> 56:19.923
How the fuck did Sammy know we was here?

56:27.567 --> 56:29.285
- Hector.
- Charlie.

56:29.327 --> 56:31.363
How are you?

56:31.407 --> 56:33.398
Good to see you. OK?

56:33.447 --> 56:35.438
Good to see you. You all right?

56:35.487 --> 56:37.079
How are you doing, mate?

56:38.407 --> 56:39.726
How's it going?

56:39.767 --> 56:43.157
I was just telling our friends here
how you're always late.

56:44.887 --> 56:48.357
Sorry about what happened earlier.
Unwanted company. Won't happen again.

56:48.407 --> 56:50.921
HECTOR: We change our drop.
It's too risky there.

56:50.967 --> 56:52.764
They building hotels everywhere.

56:52.807 --> 56:56.482
Yeah, I kept telling him, "Move down the coast,
it's too hot for us round here."

56:56.527 --> 56:58.006
Sí. Your partner is wise.

56:58.047 --> 56:59.605
You should listen to him.

56:59.647 --> 57:01.399
Anyway, it's done now.

57:01.447 --> 57:03.039
We're all here.

57:03.087 --> 57:05.965
Let's just wipe our mouths of what happened
and move forward, eh?

57:06.007 --> 57:07.998
HECTOR: So, why not a big drop next?

57:08.047 --> 57:11.198
We can move double the amount.
Can you handle that?

57:11.247 --> 57:14.045
SAMMY: Can we handle it?
What do you think we are? Spanish?

57:14.087 --> 57:15.406
(Laughs)

57:15.447 --> 57:18.723
- I like your partner, Charlie. He has mucho ball.
- Yeah.

57:18.767 --> 57:21.918
We've known each other since we were kids.

57:21.967 --> 57:23.958
He's one of your own.

57:25.167 --> 57:28.159
Well, we'll speak on telephone.
Same call box, same time.

57:28.207 --> 57:29.481
For sure.

57:29.527 --> 57:31.995
- Bye, Charlie.
- Take care.

57:32.047 --> 57:33.685
Safe journey.

57:48.607 --> 57:52.156
What the fucking hell are you playing at, Sam?
How did you know we was here?

57:52.207 --> 57:54.277
What are you doing slipping in on my deal?

57:54.327 --> 57:57.046
Listen, Charl, that's not important now.

57:57.087 --> 57:58.679
Keep your fucking deal.

57:58.727 --> 58:01.195
We've all got the same problem
to deal with right now.

58:01.247 --> 58:02.441
Which is?

58:02.487 --> 58:04.876
- The mayor.
- So?

58:04.927 --> 58:07.487
What are we gonna do? Kill the geezer?

58:09.487 --> 58:10.602
Yeah.

58:11.447 --> 58:15.406
Here, one of you two talk some sense
into this fucking div.

58:15.447 --> 58:18.120
RONNIE: What else are we gonna do?
- What do you mean?

58:18.167 --> 58:21.637
Well, what else are we gonna do?
Shut up shop and fuck off back to Peckham?

58:21.687 --> 58:24.759
Bollocks.
This geezer can close us down in an hour.

58:24.807 --> 58:26.001
SAMMY: You.

58:26.047 --> 58:30.040
Now, I don't wanna be your mate,
but am I talking bollocks here?

58:30.087 --> 58:31.600
Can he be got at?

58:31.647 --> 58:35.117
Course he can be got at. Anyone can be got at.

58:35.167 --> 58:37.158
SAMMY: We do this one thing together

58:37.207 --> 58:39.357
and then we go our own way.

58:39.407 --> 58:41.204
No agg.

58:41.247 --> 58:43.477
You got any tools?

58:44.367 --> 58:45.846
Bring 'em.

58:45.887 --> 58:47.525
Ta-ta, Charles.

58:59.447 --> 59:01.517
How the fuck did they know we was here?

59:01.567 --> 59:03.285
I don't fucking know.

59:03.327 --> 59:05.477
(Car starts)

59:46.087 --> 59:47.839
FRANKIE: Like I told you earlier,

59:47.887 --> 59:49.957
- drugs make you greedy.
- Bollocks.

59:50.007 --> 59:52.475
And we were about to blow the lot,
down to cocaine.

59:53.287 --> 59:55.596
We'd fucked with the old country.
They'd had enough.

59:55.647 --> 59:59.640
They shut us down, took away everything we
had before we could even chop out another line.

59:59.687 --> 01:00:03.077
But we were so out of our heads,
we couldn't even see it coming.

01:00:03.927 --> 01:00:06.885
We were about to learn the hard way.

01:00:21.647 --> 01:00:24.605
Here you are, have some of that.
Wait here a minute.

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.001
(Sniffs)

01:00:39.407 --> 01:00:40.840
(Clattering)

01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:42.878
(Dog barking)

01:00:43.847 --> 01:00:45.838
(Low rumble of thunder)

01:00:51.407 --> 01:00:54.001
Oh, what do you fucking want, you snake?

01:00:54.047 --> 01:00:56.686
- Shut up, bitch. Where's Ronnie?
- Akip!

01:00:56.727 --> 01:00:58.080
Fucking wake him, then.

01:00:58.127 --> 01:01:00.197
Leave off, he'll fucking kill me.

01:01:00.247 --> 01:01:02.203
I'll kill you, if you don't. Go and wake him.

01:01:02.247 --> 01:01:03.362
Fuck.

01:01:04.567 --> 01:01:06.762
(Thunder)

01:01:10.447 --> 01:01:11.800
What do you want?

01:01:11.847 --> 01:01:13.360
We ain't got nowhere to sleep.

01:01:13.407 --> 01:01:16.843
What did you fucking wake me up for?
Why didn't you just let 'em in?

01:01:16.887 --> 01:01:18.718
SHIRLEY: Fuck off.
CHARLIE: Hurry up.

01:01:18.767 --> 01:01:21.918
All right, mush, keep it down. I'll buzz you in.

01:01:35.447 --> 01:01:37.438
CHARLIE: Are you still awake?

01:01:38.447 --> 01:01:40.756
FRANKIE: I'm hardly gonna be asleep, am I?

01:01:45.607 --> 01:01:47.245
Listen.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:49.801
We'll get the mayor out of the way
in the morning.

01:01:51.127 --> 01:01:53.322
We'll be back in business by lunchtime.

01:01:54.247 --> 01:01:56.238
We've gotta open the club.

01:01:56.287 --> 01:01:58.926
Sonny reckons he's throwing a party
tomorrow night.

01:02:00.167 --> 01:02:01.839
He couldn't throw a tennis ball.

01:02:06.487 --> 01:02:10.526
Hey, Charl, I've been thinking about
getting one of them Learjets.

01:02:10.567 --> 01:02:12.683
The only way to travel.

01:02:14.207 --> 01:02:16.198
How much?

01:02:16.247 --> 01:02:18.238
No, you buy into 'em.

01:02:19.407 --> 01:02:21.398
Like share it with a pop star.

01:02:22.407 --> 01:02:24.045
Maybe Madonna.

01:02:24.087 --> 01:02:25.315
Holiday?

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:26.402
No.

01:02:26.447 --> 01:02:28.438
For work and that.

01:02:32.287 --> 01:02:33.686
(Sighs)

01:02:38.647 --> 01:02:40.956
You know what I might do next?

01:02:43.407 --> 01:02:44.681
Go on.

01:02:46.007 --> 01:02:47.998
Slip down to South America.

01:02:48.047 --> 01:02:50.322
I reckon we'd crack it down there.

01:02:50.367 --> 01:02:52.039
Plot up,

01:02:52.087 --> 01:02:54.078
send the odd parcel home.

01:02:54.127 --> 01:02:56.083
We'd be caked in six weeks.

01:02:56.127 --> 01:02:58.960
Fly backwards and forwards in the Lear.

01:03:01.767 --> 01:03:03.758
That's it.

01:03:03.807 --> 01:03:05.798
Now you're talking.

01:03:06.967 --> 01:03:08.639
We're really living, ain't we?

01:03:15.567 --> 01:03:17.159
Every fucking minute.

01:03:40.527 --> 01:03:43.519
CHARLIE: Sweet.
- Where did you kip?

01:03:43.567 --> 01:03:46.639
CHARLIE: Ronnie's. You?
SAMMY: Round my mate's time-share.

01:03:47.927 --> 01:03:49.565
Are you ready for this?

01:03:49.607 --> 01:03:51.598
Course I fucking am. Couldn't get no tools.

01:03:51.647 --> 01:03:53.638
Have a peep in the boot.

01:04:11.487 --> 01:04:13.318
SAMMY: Are you fit?

01:04:13.367 --> 01:04:14.720
Come on.

01:04:14.767 --> 01:04:18.077
- Let's do this lively.
- I've gotta take the kids to the beach.

01:04:18.127 --> 01:04:20.197
Right, who's gonna go and have a look about?

01:04:22.447 --> 01:04:25.996
- Any volunteers?
- We'll do spuds, eh, Charl?

01:04:30.327 --> 01:04:32.363
One potato, two potato, three potato, four.

01:04:32.407 --> 01:04:34.921
Five potato, six potato, seven potato, more.

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:38.876
Ron.

01:04:41.647 --> 01:04:44.719
I tell you what, this is bollocks.

01:04:56.687 --> 01:04:58.678
Good fuck, was she?

01:04:59.487 --> 01:05:00.966
Better than I thought.

01:05:01.007 --> 01:05:04.283
But seeing as she hadn't come in
a couple of years, what else did I expect?

01:05:04.327 --> 01:05:05.646
You're a fucking...

01:05:05.687 --> 01:05:07.962
What, Sam? What are you gonna do?

01:05:08.007 --> 01:05:09.998
Are you gonna shoot me on the spot?

01:05:11.087 --> 01:05:13.078
Blow your chances here?

01:05:13.127 --> 01:05:14.480
You're a mug.

01:05:14.527 --> 01:05:16.518
You always have been.

01:05:17.967 --> 01:05:21.960
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna put one right through your nut.

01:05:22.007 --> 01:05:24.760
If you get out, you ginger cunt.

01:05:35.727 --> 01:05:37.718
(Chirrup of cicadas)

01:05:55.967 --> 01:05:57.605
(Bird screeches)

01:05:57.647 --> 01:05:59.126
Wait.

01:06:15.367 --> 01:06:16.356
Come on.

01:07:02.527 --> 01:07:04.165
(Groans in disgust)

01:07:05.527 --> 01:07:07.916
(Muffled gasps)

01:07:11.687 --> 01:07:13.678
(Breathes deeply)

01:07:20.167 --> 01:07:23.921
FRANKIE: Remember when I told you
me and the playboy had the world in our hands?

01:07:25.847 --> 01:07:27.838
Well, it passed.

01:07:41.207 --> 01:07:43.243
Don't you fucking move!

01:07:43.287 --> 01:07:45.676
Put that fucking gun down now! Don't you move!

01:07:45.727 --> 01:07:47.365
Don't fucking move!

01:07:47.407 --> 01:07:49.796
You fucking cunt! Take that!

01:07:55.167 --> 01:07:57.840
# Look now, look all around

01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:01.840
# There's no sign of life

01:08:02.807 --> 01:08:05.446
# Voices, another sound

01:08:05.487 --> 01:08:08.001
- Where is it?
- Tell us where it is, for fuck's sake!

01:08:08.047 --> 01:08:09.844
Tell me where the fucking gear is!

01:08:09.887 --> 01:08:11.445
(Music stops)
- Tell me!

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:13.682
Else I swear I'll fucking kill the lot of you!

01:08:13.727 --> 01:08:15.479
- Where is it?
- La cocina.

01:08:15.527 --> 01:08:16.801
- Where?
- La cocina.

01:08:16.846 --> 01:08:20.522
Get in. You fucking move, you little fucking prick,
and I'll kill you!

01:08:20.567 --> 01:08:25.004
I'm fucking telling you,
don't you dare fucking move, you little cunt!

01:08:25.046 --> 01:08:27.037
- Stay there!
- I've got it! Sweet!

01:08:28.567 --> 01:08:30.796
(Mobile rings)

01:08:32.207 --> 01:08:35.483
See you all in the port, five minutes. And lively.

01:08:36.607 --> 01:08:38.598
Come on, we're on. Come on.

01:08:39.647 --> 01:08:42.366
# ADAM AND THE ANTS:
Kings Of The Wild Frontier

01:08:48.127 --> 01:08:51.403
- You look like you need some sleep, my friend.
- Whatever. Got the money?

01:08:51.447 --> 01:08:52.845
Hang on.

01:08:59.567 --> 01:09:01.000
Come on, lively.

01:09:03.087 --> 01:09:04.805
Es mierda.

01:09:04.846 --> 01:09:06.599
- What?
- He says washing powder.

01:09:06.647 --> 01:09:08.921
What are you talking about, washing powder?

01:09:08.966 --> 01:09:11.356
Fuck you, you cunt!

01:09:11.407 --> 01:09:13.682
I'll fucking do you right round the canister!

01:09:13.727 --> 01:09:15.126
Go on, fuck off!

01:09:16.687 --> 01:09:19.679
# I feel beneath the white

01:09:19.727 --> 01:09:22.604
FRANKIE: Just when I felt
things couldn't get worse, they did.

01:09:22.647 --> 01:09:25.161
We couldn't even flog a fucking ounce of Persil.

01:09:25.207 --> 01:09:27.767
We'd no more Rolexes and Porsches left to sell.

01:09:27.807 --> 01:09:30.002
There was only one thing for it.

01:09:30.046 --> 01:09:32.402
I don't know how much of this I've got left in me.

01:09:32.447 --> 01:09:34.358
Shut up, you little cunt. You're all right.

01:09:34.407 --> 01:09:37.558
All we need to do is get a grand together
and we're back in business.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:41.566
I've got these Algerians sweet up in Cádiz.
We'll go to work with them.

01:09:42.447 --> 01:09:45.041
NORA: Oh, I'm fucking sick of running around!

01:09:45.087 --> 01:09:47.282
Fucking gyp for a few poxy parking tickets.

01:09:47.327 --> 01:09:48.645
CHARLIE: Look, Frankie.

01:09:48.687 --> 01:09:50.200
It's Nora and Shirley.

01:09:50.247 --> 01:09:51.680
So?

01:09:51.727 --> 01:09:53.285
Don't you remember?

01:09:53.327 --> 01:09:54.806
Remember what?

01:09:54.847 --> 01:09:58.044
Remember when Shirley said
she'd give you a grand to fuck you?

01:09:58.087 --> 01:09:59.361
No way, Charl.

01:10:00.287 --> 01:10:01.766
Charl!

01:10:05.127 --> 01:10:06.640
Hello, girls.

01:10:06.687 --> 01:10:08.564
How are you doing?

01:10:08.607 --> 01:10:10.120
- Bloody hell.
- What happened?

01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:12.362
I've been decorating my new place.

01:10:13.807 --> 01:10:17.004
Listen, Shirl, I'm really sorry
about what happened to Ronnie.

01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:18.560
I bet you are.

01:10:19.647 --> 01:10:21.319
Look, it's Frankie down there.

01:10:21.367 --> 01:10:24.165
- You remember him, don't you?
- Jesus, he looks terrible.

01:10:24.207 --> 01:10:25.959
Looks like a fucking pikey.

01:10:26.007 --> 01:10:28.282
CHARLIE: He's OK,
he's been helping me decorate.

01:10:28.327 --> 01:10:30.841
Still got the look, though, ain't he?

01:10:30.887 --> 01:10:33.082
I'll be back in a minute, all right? Don't move.

01:10:33.127 --> 01:10:35.846
- What's he on?
- He's off his fucking trolley.

01:10:35.887 --> 01:10:38.526
Listen, we could be on here.
Get in the bar and have a wash.

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:40.080
Fuck off, Charl, no way.

01:10:40.127 --> 01:10:43.722
Listen, boy, there's a fucking grand at stake.
Now, get in there now!

01:10:43.767 --> 01:10:47.203
Charl, I'm not... I'm not fucking
brassing myself off to them wretches.

01:10:47.247 --> 01:10:49.238
- You fucking are!
- I ain't.

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:50.800
If you don't, I'll shoot you.

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:53.315
Now, get in there now! And wash your cock.

01:10:54.487 --> 01:10:55.966
And get a semi.

01:11:02.287 --> 01:11:04.278
So you're all right, girls?

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:07.717
- What are you doing around here?
- Been in Gib getting fags.

01:11:07.767 --> 01:11:10.565
Yeah. Good earner, the salmon.

01:11:12.807 --> 01:11:14.081
Here, listen.

01:11:14.127 --> 01:11:16.846
Do you remember
when you used to like my little Frankie?

01:11:16.887 --> 01:11:19.196
- Yeah, yeah, he was a nice kid.
- No, but I mean...

01:11:19.247 --> 01:11:23.638
- Remember when you used to really like him?
- He was gorgeous. Looks fucked now, though.

01:11:23.687 --> 01:11:24.802
Fucked?

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:27.315
I wouldn't say that. He's still got the rogue smile.

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:29.198
He needs a good bath, if you ask me.

01:11:31.207 --> 01:11:32.276
Listen.

01:11:35.327 --> 01:11:37.682
Do you wanna fuck him,
the pair of you, for a grand?

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:39.763
- Eh?
- Eh?

01:11:39.807 --> 01:11:42.560
- You said you'd give a grand to fuck him.
NORA: Fucking hell.

01:11:42.607 --> 01:11:44.916
That was years ago, man.

01:12:08.647 --> 01:12:10.080
Listen.

01:12:10.127 --> 01:12:13.756
Just put your fucking bag and keys
on the back seat and fuck off!

01:12:13.807 --> 01:12:15.399
Hurry up!

01:12:15.447 --> 01:12:16.846
- Fuck off!
- What's going on?

01:12:16.887 --> 01:12:20.163
- What's it look like? Get the keys. Start the car.
- I'm sorry, girls.

01:12:20.207 --> 01:12:22.482
You two really had it once, do you know that?

01:12:22.527 --> 01:12:25.121
Look at the fucking state of you now!

01:12:26.167 --> 01:12:28.203
Just get in the fucking car!

01:12:28.247 --> 01:12:32.206
You fucking... You should be ashamed of
yourselves. You used to be so fucking cool.

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.600
Shame on you, boys!

01:12:33.647 --> 01:12:35.205
Fucking wankers!

01:12:35.247 --> 01:12:39.240
- Fuck off back to your caravan, you pikeys!
- You fucking poofs!

01:12:40.087 --> 01:12:41.645
- Shit cunts!
- Come on, come on.

01:12:41.687 --> 01:12:43.678
What do you want?

01:12:44.407 --> 01:12:45.920
Give him a Stuyvesant.

01:12:45.967 --> 01:12:47.116
- What?
- Rothman.

01:12:47.167 --> 01:12:50.955
Rough man? Rough man? Fucking Rothman.
Give him a Rothman, the cunt.

01:12:53.247 --> 01:12:55.522
Yeah, he'll be wearing a blue tracksuit.

01:12:55.567 --> 01:12:56.966
Ta-da.

01:12:57.007 --> 01:12:59.680
Fucking mosquitoes are everywhere!

01:12:59.727 --> 01:13:02.605
Stop fucking driving me mad about mosquitoes.

01:13:02.647 --> 01:13:05.002
- You're going to Cádiz.
- Why aren't you coming?

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:07.766
It only needs one of us.
What's up? Are you fucking scared?

01:13:07.807 --> 01:13:09.638
I don't even know where Cádiz is.

01:13:09.687 --> 01:13:12.247
It sounds like a load of bollocks to me,
sitting around,

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:15.518
waiting for fucking Algerian sailors
with green hats,

01:13:15.567 --> 01:13:17.364
bags of gear in run-down ports.

01:13:17.407 --> 01:13:18.726
Leave me out.

01:13:39.287 --> 01:13:40.561
Qué gillipollas.

01:13:43.047 --> 01:13:44.480
Cerveza.

01:13:48.887 --> 01:13:50.798
(Barman mutters in Spanish)

01:13:50.847 --> 01:13:51.882
(Laughter)

01:14:00.807 --> 01:14:01.796
Sss-ss!

01:14:34.207 --> 01:14:35.765
(Choking)

01:14:54.767 --> 01:14:56.359
A funny thing.

01:14:56.407 --> 01:14:59.399
It's a lot quieter on the way down
than the journey up.

01:14:59.447 --> 01:15:02.200
No-one wants you around
when you've got nothing left.

01:15:02.247 --> 01:15:06.081
I wanted out so badly
but I couldn't just walk away with nothing.

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:24.802
Freeze!

01:15:26.247 --> 01:15:27.441
Jesus!

01:15:27.487 --> 01:15:28.761
Charl.

01:15:28.807 --> 01:15:30.798
What's happened to you?

01:15:32.087 --> 01:15:35.796
You all right, Sonny?
You look like you've gone right to the front.

01:15:35.847 --> 01:15:37.838
I took your old bar on, Charl.

01:15:37.887 --> 01:15:39.479
Done it up like I said.

01:15:39.527 --> 01:15:41.518
It's really cracking on.

01:15:41.567 --> 01:15:43.080
Where's Frankie?

01:15:43.127 --> 01:15:46.278
He's on his way back from Cádiz.
You seen any of the others?

01:15:46.327 --> 01:15:49.558
- I don't see anyone. Not after what happened.
- What about my Sammy?

01:15:49.607 --> 01:15:51.996
You hear things,
but no, I ain't seen him in years.

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:53.480
I just keep my nut down.

01:15:53.527 --> 01:15:56.166
If it weren't so hot,
I'd say come down there for a drink.

01:15:56.207 --> 01:15:57.322
Yeah?

01:15:58.407 --> 01:15:59.806
Maybe I will.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:02.884
- They still want you here. I'd give it a wide.
- Tell you what.

01:16:02.927 --> 01:16:05.316
We'll have a reunion party.

01:16:05.367 --> 01:16:08.086
- What for?
- What do you mean, what for?

01:16:08.127 --> 01:16:10.880
I can pull a crowd like
you've never seen before, son.

01:16:10.927 --> 01:16:12.918
I'm not saying that.

01:16:12.967 --> 01:16:15.242
I don't know, Charl. It's just...

01:16:15.287 --> 01:16:17.084
I don't know, Charlie.

01:16:17.127 --> 01:16:19.482
Yeah, yeah. That's what we'll do.

01:16:19.527 --> 01:16:22.917
We'll get the old firm back for a night.
Be fucking blinding.

01:16:22.967 --> 01:16:24.958
It's changed down there, Charl.

01:16:25.007 --> 01:16:27.965
I don't mean no offence,
but you can't just steam in.

01:16:28.007 --> 01:16:29.998
No offence?

01:16:30.047 --> 01:16:32.880
I ain't just fucking steaming in, boy.

01:16:32.927 --> 01:16:34.406
That club's still mine.

01:16:34.447 --> 01:16:36.483
Well, legally it's mine, actually.

01:16:37.527 --> 01:16:39.518
Hark at him, all the long words now.

01:16:40.287 --> 01:16:42.278
Come on, son, it'll be blinding.

01:16:42.327 --> 01:16:44.283
One little night.

01:16:44.327 --> 01:16:46.283
For old times' sake.

01:16:46.887 --> 01:16:48.798
Listen, you go and sort out the balloons,

01:16:48.847 --> 01:16:51.156
and I'm gonna put the word out that I'm back.

01:16:51.887 --> 01:16:53.320
Who to?

01:16:55.007 --> 01:16:56.998
Fucking everyone!

01:16:57.047 --> 01:16:59.322
Just like the old days, eh?

01:17:00.327 --> 01:17:02.557
Yeah, like the old days.

01:17:04.367 --> 01:17:08.246
I nearly got my throat cut in Cádiz, Charl.
Don't that tell you anything?

01:17:09.287 --> 01:17:11.084
Listen...

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:12.924
Get loads of balloons, pink ones.

01:17:12.967 --> 01:17:15.800
I like them fucking massive ones
with "party" written on them.

01:17:15.847 --> 01:17:18.725
Don't buy the kiddy ones,
they're a waste of money.

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:22.077
Oh, and er... find out where Sammy lives.
I want to surprise him.

01:17:32.327 --> 01:17:36.525
The good thing about losing everything
was there was nothing else to lose.

01:17:36.567 --> 01:17:39.957
I had one last plan,
one last person who could help me.

01:17:40.887 --> 01:17:42.878
Whether she liked it or not...

01:17:42.927 --> 01:17:44.918
we had unfinished business.

01:17:49.167 --> 01:17:51.158
So it's not just a rumour.

01:17:51.207 --> 01:17:53.198
What?

01:17:53.247 --> 01:17:55.238
You do look like shit.

01:17:56.247 --> 01:17:57.805
Thanks.

01:17:58.607 --> 01:18:00.598
How would you know?

01:18:00.647 --> 01:18:02.763
I always ask after you.

01:18:02.807 --> 01:18:04.718
If that's true, why did you fuck me over?

01:18:04.767 --> 01:18:07.281
You didn't need me to fuck your life, Frankie.

01:18:07.327 --> 01:18:09.318
You did that yourself.

01:18:22.287 --> 01:18:23.800
Frankie...

01:18:40.087 --> 01:18:41.759
I can't work you out.

01:18:53.527 --> 01:18:55.085
(Pops balloon)

01:18:55.847 --> 01:18:57.326
I've got to go.

01:18:57.367 --> 01:18:59.358
Sammy'll be wondering where I am.

01:19:03.127 --> 01:19:04.401
Is that it?

01:19:04.447 --> 01:19:06.438
Read it.

01:19:27.287 --> 01:19:29.278
Right, let's have a look at you.

01:19:30.287 --> 01:19:32.403
Fucking hell, look at the state of you.

01:19:32.447 --> 01:19:34.244
Come here.

01:19:34.967 --> 01:19:36.446
That's it.

01:19:36.487 --> 01:19:38.125
That's better.

01:19:39.767 --> 01:19:40.961
Right.

01:19:41.007 --> 01:19:42.998
You look terrific.

01:19:43.967 --> 01:19:45.559
What about me?

01:19:46.287 --> 01:19:48.278
Ream, Charl.

01:19:48.327 --> 01:19:50.443
You look ream.

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:52.886
Yeah.

01:19:52.927 --> 01:19:54.645
Have a look at this.

01:19:54.687 --> 01:19:56.678
Look at that.

01:19:58.007 --> 01:19:59.360
Got it?

01:20:03.767 --> 01:20:05.246
We're still the bollocks.

01:20:06.047 --> 01:20:08.038
Come on, let's get out there.

01:20:18.527 --> 01:20:20.518
# SLY FOX: Let's Go All The Way

01:20:24.007 --> 01:20:25.998
# Let's go all the way

01:20:28.967 --> 01:20:31.162
# We can make a better way

01:20:33.967 --> 01:20:35.958
# Let's go all the way

01:20:39.567 --> 01:20:41.558
# Let's go all the way

01:20:45.447 --> 01:20:47.642
Listen, have you got the gun sorted out?

01:20:48.447 --> 01:20:51.120
Just make sure it's empty, all right? All right.

01:21:03.647 --> 01:21:06.764
Maybe I should have driven across the border
there and then.

01:21:06.807 --> 01:21:09.196
Gone through the slips while I still could.

01:21:09.247 --> 01:21:11.715
But there was one thing left I had to take care of.

01:21:11.767 --> 01:21:16.283
And if the plan was right, I was going to enjoy it
more than the first time I got high.

01:21:48.047 --> 01:21:50.925
Did someone order a cunt?
Cos one's just showed up.

01:21:52.087 --> 01:21:54.999
Listen, I've got a bit of work.

01:21:55.047 --> 01:21:56.924
Do you want in?

01:21:56.967 --> 01:21:58.923
Why shouldn't I just kill you?

01:21:58.967 --> 01:22:00.958
Cos I've got a drop lined up.

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.876
- What sort of drop?
- A large one.

01:22:08.567 --> 01:22:09.716
White.

01:22:09.767 --> 01:22:11.280
Why come to me?

01:22:12.167 --> 01:22:14.840
You're the only one
that knows what they're doing.

01:22:14.887 --> 01:22:17.196
Go and wait by the gate.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.763
Carly, get me a pistol.

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:27.798
Something I can hide.

01:22:33.447 --> 01:22:36.280
It's got a full clip. What do you want it for?

01:22:37.287 --> 01:22:39.084
Never mind.

01:22:39.127 --> 01:22:41.083
Give us a kiss.

01:23:04.287 --> 01:23:06.278
Frankie, listen.

01:23:06.327 --> 01:23:10.320
I know we ain't got along too well
over the years, had our ups and downs,

01:23:10.367 --> 01:23:14.485
but I really appreciate the fact that
we can do a bit of business together now.

01:23:14.527 --> 01:23:17.405
To be honest,
you was the first person I thought of.

01:23:17.447 --> 01:23:19.642
You're the only one I can trust.

01:23:19.687 --> 01:23:21.757
I really appreciate that.

01:23:21.807 --> 01:23:23.718
You're a good kid.

01:23:23.767 --> 01:23:26.327
I hope this is the start of something new for us.

01:23:26.367 --> 01:23:28.403
How much did you say there was?

01:23:28.447 --> 01:23:30.483
Lt'll be worth the walk.

01:23:53.087 --> 01:23:55.078
We ain't got to get in there, have we?

01:23:55.127 --> 01:23:57.118
That's where it's coming.

01:23:57.167 --> 01:23:59.556
It's other people's shit and piss.

01:24:00.687 --> 01:24:02.678
They won't mind.

01:24:15.647 --> 01:24:17.046
(Flies buzz)

01:24:29.767 --> 01:24:32.964
Here you are, get ready for them.
They're coming.

01:24:33.007 --> 01:24:33.996
Look.

01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:52.600
There must be more.

01:25:02.567 --> 01:25:04.683
I don't believe it, Sam, this is it.

01:25:04.727 --> 01:25:06.524
Is this what it's come to?

01:25:06.567 --> 01:25:08.717
I've sniffed more than this in one day.

01:25:08.767 --> 01:25:11.076
We had it all once, Sam, and it's come to this.

01:25:11.127 --> 01:25:12.606
We really fucked it!

01:25:13.447 --> 01:25:16.598
Not me, boy. You fucked it.

01:25:18.007 --> 01:25:19.884
(Gun clicks)

01:25:19.927 --> 01:25:20.803
Bitch!

01:25:24.367 --> 01:25:27.439
Get out of the water. Drop your weapons.

01:25:30.567 --> 01:25:32.558
Give yourselves up.

01:25:33.927 --> 01:25:35.599
Hands in the air.

01:25:35.647 --> 01:25:36.636
(Gunfire)

01:27:02.607 --> 01:27:06.964
The maddest thing about crime is
it's like a drug. You never know when to stop.

01:27:07.647 --> 01:27:10.639
As much as I wanted the fairy-tale ending
with her...

01:27:11.927 --> 01:27:13.918
...I wanted it all for myself as well.

01:27:25.167 --> 01:27:28.079
You might want to check that,
what with my track record.

01:27:28.807 --> 01:27:30.763
I just did.

01:27:30.807 --> 01:27:33.401
What for? You can't kill me.

01:27:33.447 --> 01:27:35.915
You're a fucking loser like the rest of them.

01:27:36.887 --> 01:27:41.324
Trust me, if you don't pull the trigger,
I'll be seeing you again.

01:27:42.047 --> 01:27:44.163
You wish, bitch.

01:27:44.887 --> 01:27:46.718
# BLONDIE: Call Me

01:28:00.047 --> 01:28:03.198
# Call on me, oh, call up, baby...

01:28:03.247 --> 01:28:06.080
Remember that letter
my old man wrote from prison,

01:28:06.127 --> 01:28:08.846
about staying away from crime, women
and drugs?

01:28:08.887 --> 01:28:11.355
What a load of bollocks that turned out to be.

01:28:12.087 --> 01:28:14.078
I tried the lot and won,

01:28:14.127 --> 01:28:16.482
and drove off into the sunset.

01:28:16.527 --> 01:28:19.724
# I know where you're coming from

01:28:19.767 --> 01:28:22.600
# Call me on the line

01:28:23.847 --> 01:28:26.361
# Call me any anytime

01:28:26.407 --> 01:28:29.524
# Call me, I'll arrive

01:28:29.567 --> 01:28:34.083
# You can call me any day or night. Call me!

01:28:40.647 --> 01:28:43.844
# Cover me with kisses, baby

01:28:43.887 --> 01:28:46.321
# Cover me with love

01:28:47.207 --> 01:28:49.960
# Roll me in designer sheets

01:28:50.007 --> 01:28:52.805
# I'll never get enough

01:28:53.647 --> 01:28:56.525
# Emotions come, I don't know why

01:28:57.487 --> 01:29:01.082
# Cover of love's alibi

01:29:01.887 --> 01:29:04.799
# Call me on the line

01:29:04.847 --> 01:29:08.362
# Call me, call me any anytime

01:29:08.407 --> 01:29:11.922
# Call me, I'll arrive

01:29:11.967 --> 01:29:15.277
# When you're ready we can share the wine

01:29:15.327 --> 01:29:17.318
# Call me

01:29:22.647 --> 01:29:28.119
# Ooh, he speaks the languages of love

01:29:29.367 --> 01:29:33.883
# Ooh, amore, chiamami

01:29:33.927 --> 01:29:36.122
# Chiamami

01:29:36.167 --> 01:29:40.718
# Ooh, appelle-moi, mon chéri

01:29:40.767 --> 01:29:42.519
# Appelle-moi

01:29:42.567 --> 01:29:46.401
# Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, anyway!

01:29:48.447 --> 01:29:53.157
# Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, any day!

01:30:28.167 --> 01:30:31.125
# Call me, my love

01:30:31.167 --> 01:30:34.842
# Call me, call me any anytime

01:30:34.887 --> 01:30:37.765
# Call me for a ride

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:41.561
# Call me, call me for some overtime

01:30:41.607 --> 01:30:44.599
# Call me, my love

01:30:44.647 --> 01:30:48.083
# Call me, call me in a sweet design

01:30:48.127 --> 01:30:50.038
# Call me

01:30:50.087 --> 01:30:55.161
# Call me for your lover's lover's alibi

01:30:55.207 --> 01:30:58.005
# Call me, I don't mind

01:30:58.047 --> 01:31:01.881
# Call me, call me any anytime

01:31:01.927 --> 01:31:03.918
# Call me

01:31:03.967 --> 01:31:05.958
# Oh, call me

01:31:08.447 --> 01:31:10.438
# Call me...

01:31:11.305 --> 01:31:17.184
