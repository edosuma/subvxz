00:02.400 --> 00:03.460
Previously on Harrow...

00:03.520 --> 00:06.020
Fern Harrow,
you're under arrest for arson,

00:06.080 --> 00:08.060
resulting in the death of
Timothy Markides.

00:08.119 --> 00:10.860
Our house-fire victim fell asleep
while smoking a cigarette,

00:10.920 --> 00:13.180
so the police won't be pursuing
an arson charge

00:13.240 --> 00:14.980
against the theoretical suspect.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.180
When Fern is released from prison, I
need you to take her somewhere safe.

00:18.240 --> 00:21.900
Is there any way that body
was not Francis Chester?

00:21.960 --> 00:23.900
The burnt body
came from the prison.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.800
If it wasn't Chester,
then who the hell was it?

00:25.824 --> 00:28.980
You want to dig up Francis's body?
My son is dead.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.700
And he's gonna stay that way.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.060
Maxine signed this?
Turns out Chester's mother is dead

00:34.120 --> 00:36.140
and Maxine's been convinced
by other arguments.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.940
Looks to me like
you've got your exhumation.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.700
No-one's digging up anything.
You are suspended.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.020
I've got to prove
that Chester is still alive.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.620
Well...

02:31.680 --> 02:33.340
this all looks in order.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.900
Put it through.

02:35.880 --> 02:39.460
You must be happy to see this
going home to Egypt after so long.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.900
He is 4,000 years old.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.620
120 years in this country is nothing.

02:46.680 --> 02:50.260
But we are grateful to Mr Hobson
for arranging his return.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.940
Mr Hobson will also be pleased
with outcome.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.700
What is it?

03:00.960 --> 03:02.260
Call the police.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.380
What... seems to be the problem?

03:04.440 --> 03:06.940
The problem is
that dead ancient Egyptians

03:07.000 --> 03:09.380
shouldn't have titanium hip joints.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.260
Ooh. It's so early.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.060
My coffee needs a coffee to wake up.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.100
Well, what have we here, then?

03:31.200 --> 03:33.780
Ooh. That's no prince of Egypt.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.580
No, but it is the golden king.

03:35.640 --> 03:36.940
Howard Hobson.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.580
Mining magnate?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.180
Didn't know he was dead.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.220
Yeah, well, no-one does. Yet.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.340
So, until we find out
why he was found

03:44.400 --> 03:46.580
in this Cairo-bound casket
this morning,

03:46.640 --> 03:48.220
we're gonna keep it under wraps.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.180
Hilarious pun intended.

03:51.240 --> 03:54.420
So, this coffin,
and the body that WAS in it,

03:54.480 --> 03:58.140
is part of a collection accumulated
by Hobson's grandfather.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.180
Hobson here was sending it
back to Egypt.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.260
Someone decided he should go with.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.420
Looks to me
like Middle Kingdom period.

04:05.480 --> 04:10.060
Faint Nubian influences,
around 1800 BCE.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.260
What? You sound like Harrow.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.140
No!

04:15.200 --> 04:17.899
Eugh! Sorry. I'll just...

04:19.000 --> 04:22.060
So, the mummy that was in here...

04:22.120 --> 04:24.180
Yes, well...

04:24.240 --> 04:28.060
that's something these two
seem very keen to find out about.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.900
They are not happy
that it's missing.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.660
He's from the Egyptian Office

04:31.720 --> 04:33.140
of Antiquities.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.660
She's his translator.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.660
They've been helping Mr Hobson

04:37.720 --> 04:39.840
prepare his private
Egyptian collection for transport.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.940
Someone helped Mr Hobson.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.260
He didn't put himself
in these bandages.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.820
No. Hey, where's Harrow?

04:46.880 --> 04:50.140
I thought he'd be keen as mustard to
check out an old coffin like this.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.380
God...

04:59.440 --> 05:00.860
What the f...?

05:25.720 --> 05:27.540
Shit.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.100
Aaagh!

05:41.560 --> 05:43.740
Harrow's suspended? Why?

05:43.800 --> 05:45.540
He forged my signature.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.640
Yeah, well, I forged your signature
with the postman

05:47.680 --> 05:49.480
when I signed for your lingerie
the other day.

05:49.504 --> 05:51.140
A work document.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.540
Yeah, but why?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.180
Does it matter?!

05:55.240 --> 05:57.620
He went over my head to the Coroner

05:57.680 --> 05:59.780
with a signature I didn't sign.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.580
But what did he want to authorise?
Bryan...

06:03.640 --> 06:05.380
It's irrelevant.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.300
We tell each other stuff, Max.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.500
Yeah.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.260
And sometimes, we have to trust that
the other is doing the right thing.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.500
Dr Pavich?

06:15.560 --> 06:17.020
Edwina.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.180
Great.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.900
Come with me.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.500
You've reached Daniel Harrow.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.540
Leave a message
and I'll return your...

06:36.600 --> 06:38.020
So, where is Dr Harrow?

06:38.080 --> 06:40.260
"DOCTOR Harrow" now, is it?

06:40.320 --> 06:42.540
Trouble in paradise?

06:42.600 --> 06:44.740
Not paradise, Uncle Lyle.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.140
We had sex. Once.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.140
Before I started work here.
Right.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.580
I find Harrow interesting...
and attractive.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.100
But he's very irritating.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.060
I'm not sure if it's because he has
a gift for finding flaws in my work

06:58.120 --> 07:00.460
or because I keep finding
a billion flaws in him

07:00.520 --> 07:02.140
but still can't fault his work.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.540
So, where is he?
I think he's been suspended.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.780
What?!

07:06.840 --> 07:08.060
Ooh, hello.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.540
Fancy seeing you here.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.020
Edwina Gharam, this is Dr Fairley.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.660
I've met Dr Fez. Of course.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.700
And Dr Molyneux.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.380
Edwina is a registered nurse who's
joining us for probationary period

07:19.440 --> 07:21.060
as a forensic assistant.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.900
OK, so, suit up
and you can get to work.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.700
Maxine? Daniel's been suspended.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.940
Yes, I heard.
So, what will happen to him now?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.660
Just do your job today.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.740
Daniel's problems
are of his own making.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.660
Hello? Help!

07:55.720 --> 07:58.020
I'm...

08:01.760 --> 08:03.020
Chester.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.980
Hello to you too, Dr Harrow.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.540
What do you want?

08:07.600 --> 08:09.820
It's "What did YOU want?"

08:09.880 --> 08:12.460
You wanted proof
that I wasn't dead, right?

08:12.520 --> 08:13.900
Now you've got it.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.660
Only... I'm afraid
you can't really share it.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.700
I'm sure you've discovered the phone
doesn't make outgoing calls.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.260
That is just for you and me
to while away the time.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.260
And I know you tried to get
an exhumation order,

08:28.320 --> 08:30.180
and I know you failed.

08:30.240 --> 08:34.299
So, I know it's gonna be some time
before they find you.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.659
Maybe... weeks. Maybe months.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.059
Or maybe never.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.700
Why are you doing this?

08:40.760 --> 08:43.059
Because you ruined my life.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.700
There was no way I was going to jail

08:45.760 --> 08:50.500
until you miraculously found the
evidence that changed everything,

08:50.560 --> 08:52.780
So, that's what this is?

08:52.840 --> 08:56.580
Shitty, cheap revenge?

08:56.640 --> 09:01.620
The same motive
as your patsy, Brendan Skene?

09:01.680 --> 09:04.980
I left
that little breadcrumb trail for you

09:05.040 --> 09:06.460
and you did find it.

09:06.520 --> 09:10.380
Or, rather, Simon van Reyk found it.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.980
You... bastard.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.100
It was me you wanted to hurt.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.900
You didn't have to kill him.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.660
I did warn you.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.340
"Everything you hold dear,"

09:24.480 --> 09:25.940
I'm gonna kill you.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.540
Dr Harrow, I do admire
your optimism.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.220
So, you left Euralla.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.900
I did.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.660
I'm not the only one.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.740
And you're from Euralla too?

09:56.800 --> 09:59.580
I heard you were a great neurosurgeon
until something went wrong.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.860
It is fun, poking around
in people's pasts, Ms Gharam.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.700
Should I autopsy yours?

10:07.760 --> 10:10.540
Nah. Everyone's got a story, right?

10:11.480 --> 10:14.340
What's this guy's?
Mr Howard Hobson.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.380
The mining magnate.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.300
How appropriate.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.580
Why?

10:19.640 --> 10:23.300
Embalming was the purview
of the wealthy in ancient Egypt.

10:23.360 --> 10:27.140
Now, did you know that
the embalming process took 70 days.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.700
Firstly, they would remove
all the organs.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.660
Then they would pack the body
in a lake-bed salt called natron.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.460
What?

10:35.520 --> 10:37.980
You're sounding like Harrow.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.260
Let's just get the bandages off,
shall we?

10:40.320 --> 10:44.220
Wait a second. Is this how he was
found - with his face uncovered?

10:47.760 --> 10:49.940
Why go to all the trouble
of wrapping him like this,

10:50.000 --> 10:51.380
but not his mouth?

10:51.440 --> 10:53.440
Unless he was still alive
when he was put in there.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.820
Haemorrhaging. Possibly.

11:05.880 --> 11:06.900
Meaning...?

11:06.960 --> 11:09.620
Possibly he did suffocate in there.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.940
Meaning...?
Hobson didn't wrap himself up.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.220
If he was alive
when he was put in the coffin

11:15.280 --> 11:17.220
and cause of death
was asphyxiation, then...

11:17.280 --> 11:19.020
It's manslaughter. Or murder.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.860
If he was still alive
when he was locked in that coffin,

11:21.920 --> 11:23.300
how long would he have lasted?

11:23.360 --> 11:27.900
Well, if he was unconscious and
breathing shallowly, several hours.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.180
But if he was panicking
and hyperventilating...

11:31.240 --> 11:33.820
If he couldn't control
his breathing...

11:33.880 --> 11:35.860
less than three.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.300
God...

11:54.160 --> 11:55.940
What do you want, Chester?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.460
I just want to chat.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.980
Don't you think we have
lots to chat about?

12:00.040 --> 12:01.540
How are you?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.580
Great. Wish you were here.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.380
How does that smell?

12:07.440 --> 12:09.660
Whose body was it? Well...

12:09.720 --> 12:11.780
it wasn't mine.

12:11.840 --> 12:16.460
Despite your drunken friend,
Laurie Badcoe, signing that it was.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.340
I AM gonna get out of here.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.700
The mathematics of oxygen depletion
say otherwise.

12:24.760 --> 12:28.820
So, why don't you save breaking
your nails on coffin-maker pine,

12:28.880 --> 12:30.980
sit back, relax,

12:31.040 --> 12:32.820
and enjoy the movies?

12:34.040 --> 12:35.340
Movies?

12:45.640 --> 12:47.820
Fish, baby?

12:48.760 --> 12:50.380
You're out!

12:57.360 --> 12:58.740
Fish.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.100
Cal, get back.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.340
She's a cop.
She wants to arrest me again.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.660
Why?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.460
Arrest her.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.140
Arrest her. Put her back inside.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.780
Fish, what's going on?

13:25.760 --> 13:27.460
Get in!

13:52.040 --> 13:54.260
Suspended? Why?

13:55.160 --> 13:57.680
I imagine it's got something to do
with this latest crazy theory

13:57.704 --> 14:00.060
that this is all
supposed to be about.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.140
You still don't believe it?

14:08.480 --> 14:12.220
I've never met a man who's so right
about things as Daniel.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.780
And so wrong about people.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.460
He can see the tiniest detail
in a millimetre of flesh...

14:22.800 --> 14:27.580
and miss a mile of loneliness
right in front of him.

14:27.640 --> 14:31.820
And now it's got to the point
where I don't know what to believe.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.220
But...

14:34.640 --> 14:36.260
you do.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.780
Anyway, I have to go to work.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.340
So, stay here, OK?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.700
Just in case your father is right.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.300
Yeah...

14:54.240 --> 14:56.620
He looks 3,000 years old already.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.260
I heard he's had,
like, two or three wives.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.020
And about 100 mistresses.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.780
Money! Right?

15:03.840 --> 15:05.260
How much is he worth?

15:05.320 --> 15:07.100
Well, his grandfather was

15:07.160 --> 15:09.020
a contemporary of Cecil Rhodes.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.500
So, billions.

15:11.400 --> 15:15.540
Skin damage consistent with age
of the deceased. It's very thin.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.420
Explains why there were
so many bandages to hand.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.500
No contusions around his neck
to suggest strangulation.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.380
But... What?

15:23.440 --> 15:25.620
Does his tongue look dry to you?

15:27.360 --> 15:30.420
Yes. It does look quite dehydrated.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.980
Almost damaged.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.620
Let's get all the fluids we can,
see what they tell us.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.780
And a full tox.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.220
Shall we check posterior first?
Let's.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.780
Be aware, the dead can
often flatulate when they move.

15:44.840 --> 15:45.940
Cheers.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.740
Three, two, one...

15:56.440 --> 15:58.940
What the hell caused those?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.700
That's what I'm here to find out.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.980
Jeesh.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.740
Well, there's plenty
to look through.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.500
Dr Grace Molyneux
from the morgue.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.540
Ufa Sabry, Nenet Botro,

16:18.600 --> 16:21.180
from Egypt's Office of Antiquities.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.700
And Clayton Pike,
Mr Hobson's lawyer.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.620
And professional staller

16:25.680 --> 16:27.300
on providing a copy
of Mr Hobson's will.

16:27.360 --> 16:31.020
Well, you'll see it for yourself
once you produce a warrant.

16:31.080 --> 16:34.060
I'm simply protecting
my client's interests.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.380
We don't understand
why you are stalling.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.620
We also need to see the will.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.500
There is a great deal of publicity
in our country

16:43.560 --> 16:45.460
concerning the return
of these artefacts

16:45.520 --> 16:47.060
and the missing mummy.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.660
It will be hugely embarrassing
for our government

16:49.720 --> 16:51.860
if they do not arrive in Cairo.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.820
We're doing all we can.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.980
Um, so, is this where
the sarcophagus sat?

17:03.040 --> 17:05.420
Yeah. SOCOs found fibres
on the floor,

17:05.480 --> 17:08.220
presumably where the old mummy
was removed.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.980
No security cameras?

17:10.040 --> 17:12.020
They were switched off.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.300
Do you see anything that might have
caused those marks on his back?

17:17.520 --> 17:19.220
Let's keep looking.

17:20.359 --> 17:22.140
We'll be back presently.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.819
Hey, Scotty. Detective.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.980
I don't think he just slept in here.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.900
I don't think I'll sleep
for a while, having seen those.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.700
There's more down here.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.500
How does that bloody work?

17:47.360 --> 17:49.620
What's the story with Hobson's wife?

17:49.680 --> 17:51.400
The current one
that's trying to divorce him

17:51.440 --> 17:52.900
or the former one that succeeded?

17:52.960 --> 17:55.300
They're both proving
a bit slippery today.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.540
What? Grab that side.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.820
What...?

18:04.520 --> 18:08.100
What in blue blazes is that?

18:08.160 --> 18:11.660
Well, that is an 18th-century
wheat-threshing sled.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.340
Wasn't wheat being threshed up here.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.500
That explains the marks
on Hobson's back.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.780
And the need for all the bandages.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.220
Wow.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.340
Getting old's something
to look forward to?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.620
Has Scenes of Crime
inspected this room yet?

18:30.680 --> 18:32.740
Not fully. Why?

18:34.800 --> 18:36.340
Cocaine?

18:37.440 --> 18:39.180
I don't think so.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.780
Yello.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.660
Who's this? Who's that?

18:46.720 --> 18:48.300
It's me. Grace.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.820
What...? I'm... Grace.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.260
No, me, Edwina.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.620
Gotcha.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.060
Is, Dr Fairley there?

18:54.120 --> 18:55.900
- Tell her I'm here.
- I can hear him.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.620
She can hear you.
Tell her I've got my hands full.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.980
He's got his hands full.
I can hear him.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.500
Um, can you ask
if he has blood results?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.420
Tell her I've got
the blood results back.

19:05.480 --> 19:06.980
I'm not enjoying this.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.500
Look, can't you just put him on.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.380
What...? No, I'm busy here.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.980
Just tell her...

19:12.040 --> 19:13.340
I can hear you.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.540
Good. Now... now, listen.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.220
I've got the blood results back.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.580
Anything to suggest
he didn't suffocate?

19:20.640 --> 19:23.460
No, but... here's
the interesting thing.

19:23.520 --> 19:26.260
The bloods reveal HS troponin.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.900
You know what troponins are?

19:27.960 --> 19:30.220
Proteins released
when a patient has a heart attack.

19:30.280 --> 19:34.300
So, maybe whoever wrapped Hobson up
thought he was already dead,

19:34.360 --> 19:36.580
but he was only unconscious
after the heart attack.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.180
I want you to look for
one more thing.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.420
What - apart from
cause of death? What?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.740
Sildenafil. What's sildenafil?

19:45.320 --> 19:46.580
Quite a lot.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.620
What is sildenafil?

19:49.680 --> 19:50.860
Viagra? Yeah.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.380
That's one brand name for it.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.300
How much did he have?

19:54.360 --> 19:57.020
Four times more than
his doctor's recommended maximum.

19:59.360 --> 20:02.260
So, Hobson took a stiffener,
hoping for kinky sex,

20:02.320 --> 20:03.780
and instead...

20:03.840 --> 20:05.740
Had a heart attack
and appeared to have died.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.740
And someone wrapped him up,

20:07.800 --> 20:10.580
put him in a coffin
that was going far, far away.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.540
I think we'd better
speak to Hobson's wives.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.220
You want to explain

20:22.280 --> 20:24.980
what you and the former Mrs Hobson
were fighting about?

20:25.040 --> 20:27.860
Well, I'd hardly call THAT a fight.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.020
We were just having
a friendly discussion.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.580
We're great friends, Alice and I.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.580
Arguing the day before
your husband was found dead.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.660
I was shocked to learn of
Howard's death.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.300
So, you don't know
what he was up to in his bedroom?

20:40.360 --> 20:41.940
No, I don't.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.900
But I can imagine.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.900
We sleep in separate bedrooms.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.500
So, you don't sleep together,
you don't have sex,

20:48.560 --> 20:50.220
you put up with his infidelity.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.040
What, are you just marking time
until he dies

20:52.080 --> 20:53.220
so you get his fortune?

20:53.280 --> 20:55.700
Have you seen his will? Not yet.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.620
I only get half of Howard's estate.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.580
Who gets the other half?

21:02.840 --> 21:04.580
I had no idea.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.800
Well, his current wife doesn't seem
too happy about it.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.500
Well, Isabella, of all people,
should understand.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.020
I imagine it's compensation,

21:12.080 --> 21:15.460
for the indignity
Howard's behaviour caused.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.780
I, of course, coped a lot better
than poor Isabella.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.340
She wanted to leave him

21:20.400 --> 21:23.080
but she was afraid he'd find out
and he'd write her out of the will.

21:23.104 --> 21:24.764
I imagine that's why she killed him.

21:27.640 --> 21:29.740
She told you that?

21:29.800 --> 21:32.340
Were you planning on leaving Howard?
So what if I was?

21:32.400 --> 21:35.980
Can you imagine what it's like
to be married to a man who cheats,

21:36.040 --> 21:37.740
and everybody knows?

21:39.800 --> 21:41.540
It's embarrassing.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.620
And it's heartless.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.460
Speaking of heart,

21:46.520 --> 21:48.060
you would have been aware of

21:48.120 --> 21:49.900
how much sildenafil
would stop that heart.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.900
Well, that would require me
to care about Howard's health.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.460
Well, you cared about
being written out of his will.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.500
The only person who knew that

21:58.560 --> 22:01.540
was the woman
who was so pathetically broke,

22:01.600 --> 22:05.100
she would do anything
to get her hands on that money.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.260
How gauche!

22:10.320 --> 22:13.220
Isabella should know
that a woman's finances

22:13.280 --> 22:14.940
are as personal as her age.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.620
Yeah, well, we've checked
your finances

22:16.680 --> 22:18.460
and you're all but bankrupt.

22:18.520 --> 22:22.260
And that's why I went there -
to ask for a 'tide me over'.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.540
But Isabella
stopped you coming in.

22:25.480 --> 22:29.260
Maybe you knew she was a heavy
sleeper and you came back later.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.740
Where were you last night?

22:30.800 --> 22:32.220
I don't recall.

22:32.280 --> 22:35.300
Sometimes, I have a drink... or two,

22:35.360 --> 22:38.060
to forget the joys of matrimony.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.980
Joys that include bondage bars?

22:40.040 --> 22:42.020
Well, you've seen Howard's body.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.060
It's like an overbaked radish

22:44.120 --> 22:46.420
that rolled under the fridge
for a month.

22:46.480 --> 22:49.180
There are pills
to pump up those radishes.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.860
It's sad that you should
know that, dear.

22:53.920 --> 22:57.300
I haven't heard that many lies
since my ex-wife's wedding vows.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.940
So, we'll get a DNA swab
on both of them

23:01.000 --> 23:03.660
and see if we can find traces
on those bandages.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.220
That's the thing -

23:05.280 --> 23:08.220
I don't get why either of them would
want to hide the fact Hobson died.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.340
His death means
they're each worth a fortune.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.100
Well, they're both lying.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.700
They were both there.
They both had a motive.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.460
One of them did it.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.740
Who's that?

23:17.800 --> 23:20.780
Hobson's grandson.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.180
All this talk of sex
and money and betrayal

23:23.240 --> 23:25.380
makes me think I should have
gone to seminary college.

23:25.440 --> 23:26.980
But think of Maxine.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.580
Speaking of, do you know why
Harrow was suspended?

23:31.640 --> 23:34.100
Maxine doesn't do anything
without good reason.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.940
Part of why I love her.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.860
You've reached Daniel
Harrow. Leave a message and...

24:26.680 --> 24:29.460
You'd almost look cute
with a dog.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.980
I'd like to have a dog.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.860
One day.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.420
I'd like everything
to be normal one day.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.060
I'm sorry.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.780
It's not your fault.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.300
Have you packed?

24:51.360 --> 24:53.140
I'm not going.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.260
Your father told me to take you
to my uncle's.

24:55.320 --> 24:56.780
I'm not going.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.620
Your dad is so sure
that you're in danger, Fish.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.820
I'm here. I'm not in jail, am I?

25:03.800 --> 25:06.500
If that was the guy's plan,
then it failed.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.180
Yeah, and if that's true,
then this guy's a killer, Fish!

25:09.240 --> 25:11.620
And if your dad can't find him,
I don't know how WE can.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.900
Well, maybe Dad and I can together...

25:13.960 --> 25:15.740
With what we know
and what Dad knows,

25:15.800 --> 25:17.500
I really think we could find him.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.900
Plus... he needs me.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.820
I need you too.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.420
Do you know where he is?
He's not answering his phone.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.980
Cal, I have to find him.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.380
What do you want, Chester?

26:12.440 --> 26:14.220
Just want to hear
how you're doing, Daniel.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.740
No need to be hostile.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.500
Well, then, don't bullshit me!

26:17.560 --> 26:18.780
Alright.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.380
I wanted to hear
the fear in your voice.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.620
Well... you're out of luck.

26:25.680 --> 26:29.820
Hey, are you curious
how your daughter's doing?

26:31.200 --> 26:32.740
You leave her alone, you...

26:46.600 --> 26:48.100
What the f...?

27:02.920 --> 27:05.820
Aaaagh!

27:10.000 --> 27:12.340
You're gonna put that
in a bin, aren't you?

27:13.720 --> 27:15.540
Who are you, the litter police?
Ha.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.140
Well, I'd be doing a better job
than the actual police.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.300
I can't talk to you about the
Markides case. It's current, so...

27:22.360 --> 27:24.060
It's not about me. It's about Dad.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.260
OK, I'm gonna put it out there.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.180
Dad told me that he doesn't think

27:35.240 --> 27:37.900
that the guy who died in custody
shot him.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.300
He thinks someone else set him up,

27:40.360 --> 27:42.820
and that same person set me up

27:42.880 --> 27:45.820
and that same person killed Simon

27:45.880 --> 27:48.380
and Moran, the guy Simon visited.

27:48.440 --> 27:52.660
Moran knew the chemist
whose drugs got me arrested.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.100
And now the chemist's dead too.

27:56.360 --> 27:59.820
So, either the world took
one giant coincidence pill

27:59.880 --> 28:01.900
or... Dad was right.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.020
I don't expect you to do anything,

28:04.080 --> 28:07.820
but I do want to know
who Dad thought was behind all this.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.460
I'm not saying he is.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.580
But if your dad's right about this
and he didn't tell you...

28:16.680 --> 28:18.540
he had reason not to tell you.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.460
So, you're not gonna tell me?

28:22.440 --> 28:24.020
No.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.380
Well, I don't know where Dad is.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.740
Do you know where he is? No.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.220
Make a choice.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.580
Port Astor Morgue.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.100
Yeah, g'day, Rhonda.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.220
It's Bryan Nichols, Brisbane CIB.

29:18.280 --> 29:20.820
I'm just wondering
if Dr Badcoe is there.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.460
I'm sorry, Sergeant. No.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.700
Laurie's having a personal day.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.820
Can I take a message?

29:26.880 --> 29:28.780
No, look, just tell him I called

29:28.840 --> 29:31.180
and, maybe give us a tingle
when he gets back on deck.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.700
I will. Bye, then.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.180
Thanks, Rhonda.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.340
It's already a disaster
that the mummy is missing.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.860
Has Mr Hobson's will been released?

30:09.920 --> 30:12.380
Um, I'm afraid I don't know. Why?

30:16.800 --> 30:18.460
Having a man like Mr Hobson

30:18.520 --> 30:20.900
supporting our government
by returning these objects

30:20.960 --> 30:22.460
is very important,

30:22.520 --> 30:24.580
especially with elections coming.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.100
We need to make sure that his will
does not affect that.

30:27.160 --> 30:30.020
I'm sorry, but the police have put
the casket in our care

30:30.080 --> 30:32.660
until my pathologists have
had a chance to finish their work.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.380
Have you... finished your work?

30:37.440 --> 30:39.060
We've determined cause of death.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.500
Great, well, maybe...

30:40.560 --> 30:43.200
I would like to keep a hold of
everything just a little bit longer.

30:43.224 --> 30:44.020
Why?

30:44.080 --> 30:46.740
I'm not sure... yet.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.540
How'd you go? Great!

30:54.600 --> 30:56.940
He's every bit as attractive
on the inside.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.980
Well done on finding
that wheat-thresher thing.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.780
The cops have provided DNA
of the two exes,

31:02.840 --> 31:04.660
the bandages are at the lab.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.380
But...

31:06.440 --> 31:08.260
you're not sure a missus did it.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.780
He did die of oxygen starvation.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.620
I have seen a few choking victims.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.780
Can you pull up
the first photo of him?

31:16.840 --> 31:17.840
Sure.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.100
Someone had him naked, restrained

31:22.160 --> 31:25.220
and dosed with enough sildenafil
to stop his fragile heart.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.980
So... promise of sex but no intention.

31:28.040 --> 31:31.900
Well, promise of sex
but intention of death.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.940
When his heart stopped...

31:39.840 --> 31:42.420
he looked dead, but he wasn't.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.780
And he was unconscious long enough

31:44.840 --> 31:47.380
to be wrapped up
and put in this casket.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.900
But he wasn't dead.

31:50.960 --> 31:54.020
Then he regained consciousness
and he worked his mouth free.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.340
You saw this last time.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.780
I know.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.380
But I just thought
he'd freed his mouth to breathe.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.660
But, actually...

32:05.720 --> 32:07.380
look at that damage pattern.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.620
It's distinctively up, down.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.940
Can you turn the lights down,
please?

32:22.720 --> 32:25.060
What are you looking for?

32:25.120 --> 32:27.060
I'll tell you when I find it.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.900
Wow!

32:35.440 --> 32:36.900
'Wil'...

32:36.960 --> 32:40.300
He'd freed his mouth not to breathe
but to leave a message.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.740
What is that?

32:49.800 --> 32:52.220
I think... it's lipstick.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.940
Why are you smiling?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.820
Because I know whose it is.

32:56.880 --> 32:59.180
And she's been asking
all about Hobson's will.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.460
Because I convinced him
to change it.

33:03.520 --> 33:06.100
What were the changes
that you convinced Mr Hobson

33:06.160 --> 33:07.820
to make to his will?

33:07.880 --> 33:12.500
That his fortune would go entirely
to the Youth for Democracy Movement.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.140
The Egyptian opposition party?

33:15.200 --> 33:17.380
My mother is from Egypt.

33:17.440 --> 33:21.380
You have no idea how women
still struggle for rights there.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.180
So, I wanted to humiliate
my government.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.820
I wanted Hobson's antiquities
to arrive

33:26.880 --> 33:29.180
and, on the same day,
the press to hear

33:29.240 --> 33:32.700
how almost all his money would help
topple the rats in charge.

33:32.760 --> 33:33.980
Almost all?

33:34.040 --> 33:36.020
He wanted some to go
to his grandson.

33:36.080 --> 33:40.100
So, once he told me he would change
his will, I said I would reward him.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.900
So, I did.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.420
And once he was dead...

33:59.360 --> 34:00.860
I left.

34:00.920 --> 34:04.460
If you wanted the money
for your political party,

34:04.520 --> 34:06.740
why did you put Mr Hobson
in the casket?

34:11.159 --> 34:12.860
Because she didn't.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.020
But I think I know who did.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.020
I was actually on my way over to...

34:22.960 --> 34:25.020
tell Howard I couldn't work
for him anymore.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.820
Then I found him... like that.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.500
Trussed up like a pig.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.580
It's true what they say.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.739
There are some things in life
you just can't unsee.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.179
And that's how
he could have been found.

34:40.239 --> 34:41.900
You had other ideas?

34:41.960 --> 34:43.380
Yes, so...

34:44.360 --> 34:45.860
I got busy.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.420
I knew where to find the bandages.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.260
I prepared him.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.060
Made space for him.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.220
And set things to unfold.

34:59.280 --> 35:03.100
So, you didn't know Mr Hobson
was still alive?

35:03.160 --> 35:04.380
No.

35:04.440 --> 35:07.860
You must have known you couldn't
have got him through Customs.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.580
Of course.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.980
And I knew she'd be there.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.980
And I couldn't wait to see
the look on her face.

35:16.040 --> 35:19.140
I knew that with the mummy missing
and Hobson being in there

35:19.200 --> 35:23.540
that she wasn't gonna slip away
so easily.

35:23.600 --> 35:26.060
There would have to be
an investigation.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.820
She said that Hobson
changed the will

35:28.880 --> 35:30.740
so that the opposition party
in her country

35:30.800 --> 35:32.860
inherited pretty much everything.

35:33.760 --> 35:37.140
Such a will would leave
Isabella penniless.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.780
Isabella Hobson?

35:39.680 --> 35:42.100
The only happiness I've felt
in the last 10 years

35:42.160 --> 35:44.100
is being near Isabella.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.740
Now, I don't know
if she'll ever love me,

35:48.800 --> 35:51.900
but at least now...
she's knows I love her.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.820
How long is he away for?

36:09.760 --> 36:12.220
At least eight years.

36:12.280 --> 36:14.300
Thank God.

36:14.360 --> 36:17.180
I thought I might have to
take him to dinner.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.740
That wasn't about money at all.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.220
It was politics.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.020
And love.

36:28.080 --> 36:32.420
Yeah, well, that's a big chunk
of the day gone. Time flies?

37:01.360 --> 37:02.860
OK.

37:12.760 --> 37:16.220
Light-headed,
disoriented, thirsty?

37:17.360 --> 37:19.860
Unpleasantly disposed.

37:20.800 --> 37:24.140
You know, it's a shame
you couldn't apply your brain

37:24.200 --> 37:26.140
to being an anaesthetist

37:26.200 --> 37:28.540
instead of to being

37:28.600 --> 37:30.500
a psychotic menace.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.780
Forget about the analysis.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.740
Nobody's got it right.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.500
I got it right.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.180
I put you in jail.

37:39.240 --> 37:41.420
Yes, but you don't know why.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.780
Why you made the mistakes I found?

37:45.840 --> 37:49.700
Why I deserved to be put in jail.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.060
You killed those young people.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.340
I did.

37:54.400 --> 37:58.620
But are we born to kill,
Daniel, and suppress the instinct

37:58.680 --> 38:02.660
or are we born to protect
and learn to be killers?

38:02.720 --> 38:04.220
What do you think?

38:05.480 --> 38:07.180
I think you learnt it.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.700
Now, I don't know from where.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.340
Learnt lessons.

38:10.400 --> 38:13.460
Yes, that's what happens
in the malleable brain, isn't it?

38:13.520 --> 38:16.460
The wiring is changed
by circumstance,

38:16.520 --> 38:20.460
but then it becomes fixed
and... that's that.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.860
What happened, Francis?

38:23.920 --> 38:25.740
What did you see?

38:25.800 --> 38:28.660
It's not what I saw, Daniel.

38:28.720 --> 38:31.780
It's what you're going to see
before you die -

38:31.840 --> 38:34.940
before your air runs out.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.900
My phone...

39:05.200 --> 39:06.820
What?

39:21.840 --> 39:24.820
Shit... Shit!

39:32.040 --> 39:34.300
 I wanna buy me a pistol...

39:34.360 --> 39:35.780
Hey, it's me.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.580
 Wants me 40 rounds of ball

39:38.760 --> 39:42.260
 Shoot Crow Jane
just to see her fall

39:42.320 --> 39:43.820
 She gotta fall...

39:43.880 --> 39:45.460
Hey, Dad.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.580
Yes, you bastard.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.300
 She got to fall, she gotta

39:56.360 --> 39:59.940
 That's the reason
I begged Crow Jane

40:00.000 --> 40:02.260
 Not to hold her head so high...

40:02.320 --> 40:03.860
Dad?

40:03.920 --> 40:06.740
 Some day, baby,
you know you got to die

40:06.800 --> 40:09.020
 You got to lay down...

40:18.560 --> 40:20.220
No...

40:21.880 --> 40:23.700
God, no.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.300
 That's the reason
I begged Crow Jane

40:28.360 --> 40:31.860
 Not to hold her head too high

40:31.920 --> 40:36.780
 Some day, baby,
you know you got to die...

40:43.520 --> 40:45.460
Hi, Fern.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.700
No...

41:10.760 --> 41:12.980
Don't do it... Fern!

41:28.120 --> 41:29.940
Well done, Bub.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.340
Well done.

41:49.400 --> 41:50.980
How did he die?

41:52.360 --> 41:54.100
No-one will tell me.

41:55.920 --> 41:57.900
Well...

41:58.880 --> 42:04.100
As one ages, one's heart
tends to enlarge slightly,

42:04.160 --> 42:07.900
and the artery walls and arterials
become thicker,

42:07.960 --> 42:12.500
and then the elastic tissue within
those walls and arterials is lost.

42:12.560 --> 42:16.020
So, a condition that appears
regularly in the elderly

42:16.080 --> 42:20.220
is something called isolated
systolic hypertension and...

42:20.280 --> 42:22.100
Your Pop was old.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.740
He had a lot to live for.

42:24.800 --> 42:26.740
Especially you.

42:28.120 --> 42:30.100
But his heart just gave out.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.260
What's your name, hon?

42:33.320 --> 42:34.460
Will.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.820
Will?

42:40.080 --> 42:43.300
Listen, we think it was you
your Pop was thinking about

42:43.360 --> 42:44.780
before he passed on.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.420
So, let's just sit with him a while?

43:01.920 --> 43:03.860
You've reached Daniel Harrow.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.560
Leave a message
and I'll return your call.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.100
Yeah, get me the Deputy Coroner.

43:15.400 --> 43:16.980
Hinton speaking.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.740
Doug, Bryan Nichols.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.820
Bryan, how are you?
Yeah, good, mate. Good.

43:20.880 --> 43:22.780
Look, mate, sorry to put you
on the spot

43:22.840 --> 43:25.380
but I was just speaking to Maxine
about Harrow

43:25.440 --> 43:27.900
and, I need to know
why he forged her signature.

43:27.960 --> 43:30.460
What exactly was he trying to do?

43:30.520 --> 43:32.740
Well, he's been trying to
get permission

43:32.800 --> 43:34.940
to... dig up Francis Chester.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.620
Will? Yeah.

43:42.680 --> 43:44.300
I guess we'll never know.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.100
What was that?

43:49.160 --> 43:50.380
What was what?

43:51.560 --> 43:54.940
The worst bedside manner
I've ever seen.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.820
I used to be a neurosurgeon.

44:04.880 --> 44:07.300
Brain tumours,
they were my specialty.

44:07.360 --> 44:10.980
I didn't talk much to the patients.
I talked to the radiologists.

44:12.040 --> 44:14.220
Till a boy came in.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.580
A boy about his age.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.300
He had a...

44:18.360 --> 44:21.980
a tumour entangled
in blood vessels.

44:22.040 --> 44:23.700
Inoperable, everyone thought.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.380
And this boy...

44:26.840 --> 44:28.860
his name was Christopher,

44:28.920 --> 44:30.660
he had three months to live.

44:30.720 --> 44:33.100
I didn't talk to patients,

44:33.160 --> 44:36.500
but something...
made me talk to Christopher.

44:37.680 --> 44:39.900
He was scared.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.780
He didn't want to die.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.260
So, I thought...

44:45.320 --> 44:48.140
"No. I'm good."

44:48.200 --> 44:49.820
"He doesn't have to die."

44:50.800 --> 44:52.620
So, against everyone's advice,

44:52.680 --> 44:55.940
I convinced his parents
to let me operate.

44:57.160 --> 45:01.220
11 hours - every hour,
new blood vessels to navigate

45:01.280 --> 45:03.700
and more tumour to find and remove.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.540
About eight hours in...

45:06.680 --> 45:10.340
I realised there was healthy brain
tissue that I had to remove.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.900
So, I did.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.340
Did he die?

45:17.400 --> 45:19.780
No. He lived.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.140
But Christopher was gone.

45:23.360 --> 45:27.220
The boy who woke up,
he had lost speech,

45:27.280 --> 45:29.940
he'd lost movement,
he couldn't feed himself,

45:30.000 --> 45:31.980
he couldn't recognise a soul.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.340
So, I saved his life

45:37.400 --> 45:41.180
but the three months he could have
had with his family... I stole.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.380
After that...

45:45.440 --> 45:48.500
I found it really hard to go
with confidence into a brain.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.460
So, here I am.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.500
I didn't think
I'd have to care here.

45:54.760 --> 45:56.500
But apparently, I still do.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.900
Tea?

46:02.960 --> 46:04.820
I'll go tidy up.

46:24.840 --> 46:26.820
You've reached Daniel Harrow.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.540
Leave a message
and I'll return your call.

47:10.720 --> 47:12.540
Mum, I don't know! OK.

47:12.600 --> 47:15.280
But we're still going to the police.
What if they don't believe me?!

47:15.304 --> 47:17.724
Yeah, well, they're gonna
believe me. I'm calling Nichols.

47:24.240 --> 47:26.340
He's not answering.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.780
What are you doing?
I'm checking Dad's files.

47:28.840 --> 47:30.740
I think I know who it is.

48:04.560 --> 48:06.780
Jesus Christ, Harrow.

48:09.200 --> 48:12.260
What the hell has gone on here?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.940
We are not leaving
the police station

48:22.000 --> 48:25.740
until Bryan Nichols tells me,
to my face, that we are safe, OK?

48:30.880 --> 48:32.740
I think that could be him.

48:33.800 --> 48:37.060
What? The guy who attacked you?

48:38.360 --> 48:39.660
Cal, where are you?

48:39.720 --> 48:41.540
I'm at work.
Don't go to the Bettie.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.380
It's not safe. The Bettie, why?

48:43.440 --> 48:45.260
There was a man on there and...

48:45.320 --> 48:47.740
Listen, I'm gonna send you
a photo of him, OK?

48:47.800 --> 48:49.340
Fish, what's going on?

48:49.400 --> 48:51.460
Cal, I think he wanted to kill me.

48:51.520 --> 48:52.980
What?

48:54.360 --> 48:56.620
Hey, mate. Hey.

48:56.680 --> 48:58.500
Sorry I'm late. I had a thing.

48:58.560 --> 48:59.780
That's alright.

48:59.840 --> 49:01.180
What's wrong?

49:01.240 --> 49:03.020
Just...

49:03.080 --> 49:05.820
Nothing, just... worries at home,
you know?

49:07.760 --> 49:09.260
Nothing serious, I hope.

49:47.680 --> 49:48.820
Hey!

49:50.720 --> 49:52.180
My God.

50:15.440 --> 50:17.140
Next on Harrow...

50:17.200 --> 50:18.380
Is he gonna be OK?

50:18.440 --> 50:20.340
The next 48 hours
will be critical.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.900
He buried me alive, Bryan.
He wanted me dead.

50:22.960 --> 50:24.620
Why would Chester
go to all the trouble

50:24.680 --> 50:26.580
of digging you up after burying you?

50:26.640 --> 50:28.020
He thinks Dad's on drugs.

50:28.080 --> 50:30.580
Either I've lost my mind
or I'm right.

50:30.640 --> 50:32.620
Why won't you let this go?

50:32.680 --> 50:35.460
You are too good
to throw away a career like this.

50:35.520 --> 50:37.900
Chester's alive and I will end this.

50:37.960 --> 50:39.900
I'm afraid
you're too late, Daniel.

50:39.960 --> 50:41.740
You can either try and stop me

50:41.800 --> 50:44.500
or you can try and save the boy.
