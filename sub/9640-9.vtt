WEBVTT

00:06.879 --> 00:08.537
I can't believe we're
going out to dinner,

00:08.571 --> 00:10.269
And it's not a birthday,
anniversary

00:10.304 --> 00:12.062
Or city-wide black-out!

00:13.692 --> 00:15.116
This is going to be great!

00:15.450 --> 00:18.473
Yeah, you know where I hear
a great place to eat is?

00:18.507 --> 00:20.904
The waverly sub station!

00:22.605 --> 00:26.901
I know the owner and he
might give us a discount.

00:26.936 --> 00:30.768
Yeah, I know the owner,
too, and he won't.

00:32.167 --> 00:34.632
alex, shh!

00:34.666 --> 00:37.398
The owner is right there.

00:38.899 --> 00:41.698
Fine, we'll go out.

00:41.733 --> 00:42.965
That's great, honey.

00:43.166 --> 00:44.866
I'll call the sunshine cab company.

00:44.900 --> 00:47.234
Why do we always call them?

00:47.268 --> 00:50.737
Max, the sunshine cab company
is special to our family.

00:50.771 --> 00:54.971
They own the cab that
alex was born in...

00:55.005 --> 00:56.506
...After your cheap father

00:56.640 --> 00:58.339
Tried to get me to
walk to the hospital.

00:59.608 --> 01:01.807
I offered to push you
in a shopping cart.

01:03.475 --> 01:05.876
see? I was more exciting than you

01:05.910 --> 01:07.410
From the minute I was born.

01:07.445 --> 01:09.912
Some people don't want exciting.

01:09.946 --> 01:14.813
They want smart,
reliable and cpr certified.

01:14.847 --> 01:17.781
I remember when you were born,
too, justin.

01:17.815 --> 01:19.815
It was mid-city hospital,

01:19.849 --> 01:21.283
Room...

01:23.019 --> 01:26.384
You don't remember the
room I was born in?

01:28.120 --> 01:29.520
He was really nervous.

01:29.721 --> 01:31.786
Remember? You'd just bought
that lottery ticket...

01:31.821 --> 01:36.956
Right, the numbers
were 33-24-44-55-8-9.

01:40.292 --> 01:42.292
You remember the
lottery ticket numbers

01:42.326 --> 01:44.560
But not the room
that I was born in?

01:48.063 --> 01:51.163
Bad news. Alex's cab
isn't available.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.464
It's retired.

01:52.498 --> 01:54.031
It's headed for the junkyard.

01:55.766 --> 01:56.766
All right!

01:56.800 --> 01:58.634
I outlived a cab. Yeah!

02:00.970 --> 02:03.671
Which is very, very sad.

02:06.172 --> 02:08.439
* well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

02:08.573 --> 02:10.372
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

02:10.941 --> 02:12.542
* you could fix any problem
with the slightest ease *

02:12.576 --> 02:14.410
* yes, please *

02:14.444 --> 02:16.244
* well you might find out
it'll go to your head *

02:16.945 --> 02:17.978
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

02:18.779 --> 02:20.546
* with the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

02:20.581 --> 02:22.080
* that's what I said *

02:22.182 --> 02:25.148
* everything is not what it seems *

02:25.183 --> 02:28.918
* when you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

02:28.953 --> 02:32.721
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

02:32.754 --> 02:36.590
* because everything
is not what it seems *

02:36.624 --> 02:40.494
* everything is not what it seems *

02:40.528 --> 02:44.530
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

02:44.564 --> 02:48.100
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

02:48.134 --> 02:51.537
* because everything is not *

02:52.539 --> 02:55.206
* what it seems *

03:01.812 --> 03:05.413
Your mom's really
upset about cab 804.

03:05.448 --> 03:07.881
Well, you look upset, too, dad.

03:07.916 --> 03:09.749
Me? I'm not upset.

03:09.783 --> 03:11.050
I'm a man.

03:11.084 --> 03:13.085
Men don't get upset
about silly things

03:13.119 --> 03:15.220
Like the very cab
where their baby girl

03:15.254 --> 03:18.722
Was born is headed
for the junkyard...

03:21.191 --> 03:23.192
Will you please excuse me.

03:26.328 --> 03:28.596
It is pretty terrible
losing pieces of your past.

03:28.630 --> 03:30.764
I've never thrown out
anything I've ever worn.

03:31.098 --> 03:33.866
I incorporate the clothes into
outfits I wear as I get older.

03:35.702 --> 03:39.137
Here's a dress that has a
jumper from my toddler years.

03:41.006 --> 03:43.572
Try and guess where
I've incorporated it.

03:47.676 --> 03:50.276
Well, that's a tough one.

03:50.310 --> 03:52.812
I'm gonna have to go with...

03:52.846 --> 03:55.348
Oh, please don't make
me play this game.

03:55.382 --> 03:57.116
Look, harper,

03:57.150 --> 03:58.650
Everyone's upset,

03:58.685 --> 04:00.419
So maybe we should go down there

04:00.820 --> 04:02.954
And get, like, a souvenir from
cab 804 for my mom and dad.

04:02.989 --> 04:04.857
If you can get the
vinyl upholstery,

04:04.891 --> 04:06.325
I can make them vests.

04:06.359 --> 04:07.793
Vinyl vests?

04:07.961 --> 04:10.963
I don't know, my dad sweats
a lot in the vest area.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.074

04:20.543 --> 04:23.645
Hey! Lookihere, it's alex russo!

04:23.680 --> 04:25.547
The cab 804 baby!

04:28.919 --> 04:30.820
The baby I always talk about?

04:30.854 --> 04:32.254
These chowderheads.

04:32.289 --> 04:34.290
Hard being the smartest
guy in the room.

04:34.324 --> 04:36.525
I know how that song goes, buddy.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.395
Harper, this is my uncle al.

04:39.429 --> 04:41.063
Not my real uncle.

04:41.098 --> 04:43.999
Nice outfit.
Does your mom dress you?

04:44.034 --> 04:46.702
That'll change when you move out.

04:46.736 --> 04:49.337
look at you.

04:49.371 --> 04:51.706
These cheeks are as
chubby as the day

04:51.740 --> 04:54.441
You were born in the
backseat of the cab.

04:54.476 --> 04:57.477
Harper and I came down because
we heard about cab 804

04:57.511 --> 04:59.612
And we were wondering
if we could get

04:59.647 --> 05:01.414
Some sort of souvenir from it?

05:01.448 --> 05:03.282
My mom and dad were
upset the other night

05:03.317 --> 05:05.718
When they heard about
804 being junked.

05:05.752 --> 05:08.587
That might be the most
touching thing I've ever heard.

05:08.621 --> 05:11.288
I was being sincere.
Get the kid a keepsake.

05:15.294 --> 05:16.394
Good.

05:16.428 --> 05:18.830
Go!

05:20.899 --> 05:21.999
There.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.335
Now you'll always have
a piece of cab 804.

05:24.370 --> 05:29.307
And I'll always smell
like canadian rockies.

05:29.342 --> 05:34.346
sorry, that's all that's
gonna be left of cab 804.

05:36.716 --> 05:38.784
Uncle al, would it be ok

05:38.818 --> 05:41.053
If, um, maybe harper and
I had a moment alone

05:41.087 --> 05:42.855
To say goodbye to cab 804?

05:42.890 --> 05:45.758
Yeah. Give us a chance
to go out in the alley

05:45.792 --> 05:50.029
And not cry out there.

05:50.064 --> 05:51.898
Remember, boys,

05:51.933 --> 05:55.435
If it doesn't spill over the eyelid,
it's not tears.

05:55.470 --> 05:58.638
Wow, there's a lot
of crying going on.

05:58.673 --> 06:00.974
Add some door slams
and it's my house.

06:01.008 --> 06:04.211
Harper, I know you hate
it when I get an idea,

06:04.245 --> 06:05.279
But I've got an idea.

06:05.681 --> 06:07.115
Oh, I hate it when you get an idea.

06:07.316 --> 06:10.452
This cab means way too much
to my mom, dad, uncle al

06:10.486 --> 06:13.355
And all those guys to let it get junked.
I have to do something.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.825
Here's something. We could leave
before your idea gets us into trouble.

06:16.860 --> 06:19.328
I'm going to use magic to fix it.

06:19.363 --> 06:21.063
Now go get that toolbox over there.

06:21.198 --> 06:24.766
Oh, you're gonna use
magic on the tools.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.836
No, I'm gonna use magic on the cab.

06:27.870 --> 06:30.639
We'll put the tools near the cab
so people think we worked on it.

06:30.673 --> 06:32.407
But if we do that,
isn't that cheating?

06:32.442 --> 06:34.577
Harper, magic is cheating.

06:36.112 --> 06:38.380
I can't bear to part with
this cab that won't drive.

06:38.414 --> 06:40.615
Do whatever needs doing
to bring it alive.

06:53.823 --> 06:56.691
Hey, what's going on with 804?

06:56.725 --> 06:58.459
I fixed it.

06:58.494 --> 07:00.694
How is it possible
that a 15-year-old girl

07:00.728 --> 07:02.028
Could fix this hunk of junk?

07:02.163 --> 07:04.631
Hey, look at those tools!

07:04.665 --> 07:06.032
And they're near the cab.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.136
Hey, she's right.

07:10.170 --> 07:12.639
Those tools are near the cab.

07:12.673 --> 07:15.174
Of course she fixed it. Aw!

07:29.191 --> 07:31.960
ok, as you guys know,

07:31.994 --> 07:33.528
I went down to mid-city hospital

07:33.629 --> 07:35.329
To see exactly what
room I was born in...

07:35.363 --> 07:37.397
And I got a free gurney!

07:40.902 --> 07:42.737
Ok, which story do you
want to hear first?

07:43.205 --> 07:45.740
The story of me researching
which room I was born in,

07:45.774 --> 07:48.810
Or max's story about his
free hospital gurney?

07:48.844 --> 07:50.645
Let's hear the gurney story first,

07:51.046 --> 07:53.012
Since it's the one we probably
have to get involved in.

07:53.046 --> 07:55.445
What?!

07:55.480 --> 07:58.715
Mom, dad, here's the story.

07:58.749 --> 08:02.585
They were giving this
away and I took it.

08:04.254 --> 08:06.855
pretty amazing story, huh?

08:06.889 --> 08:09.191
When you say they
were giving it away,

08:09.225 --> 08:11.859
Was this gurney parked
next to an ambulance?

08:11.894 --> 08:14.761
Yes! - Uh,
were the lights flashing?

08:14.795 --> 08:17.795
Yes! That's what made me notice it!

08:17.829 --> 08:21.364
Max, just because something's
sitting out on the sidewalk

08:21.399 --> 08:24.334
And nobody's next to it doesn't
mean it's free for you to take.

08:24.368 --> 08:26.369
I wish you would've remembered that

08:26.570 --> 08:28.770
When you brought home that
stinky chair from the alley.

08:30.206 --> 08:32.874
Well, you shouldn't have thrown
it away in the first place.

08:34.543 --> 08:38.746
Uh, guys, sounds like an "after
we go to bed" conversation.

08:40.182 --> 08:42.049
On to my story.

08:42.083 --> 08:43.851
As you guys know, I went d.

08:43.885 --> 08:45.454
Good news.

08:45.488 --> 08:47.622
Alex, I'm talking.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.658
I'm happy to announce
mid-city hospital,

08:49.892 --> 08:52.160
Where I was born, has been
turned into a shopping center

08:52.194 --> 08:54.529
That includes one of
my favorite stores,

08:54.564 --> 08:57.599
The science fun toy activity store.

08:57.633 --> 08:59.367
Yes!

08:59.402 --> 09:02.170
Try and top that!

09:02.205 --> 09:04.773
Cab 804 is fixed.

09:04.807 --> 09:06.808
Yes!

09:09.945 --> 09:11.913
She topped it.

09:20.354 --> 09:22.689
you know what, harper?

09:22.723 --> 09:24.757
It's one of those great days.

09:24.792 --> 09:28.160
It feels so good to do
something nice for somebody.

09:28.195 --> 09:29.595
Then why'd you yell at that guy

09:29.897 --> 09:31.364
Playing guitar in front
of the restaurant?

09:31.398 --> 09:33.266
Singing about losing his girl?

09:33.300 --> 09:35.768
Waa-waa. You're playing guitar
in front of a restaurant.

09:35.803 --> 09:37.837
No wonder she's gone.

09:39.106 --> 09:42.441
Guys, check it out.

09:42.475 --> 09:44.843
I told the people at the
science fun toy activity store

09:44.878 --> 09:46.945
That I was born in it,
they hooked me up.

09:46.979 --> 09:48.713
They got me these
night-vision goggles

09:48.747 --> 09:50.348
And this flashlight that can work

09:50.582 --> 09:54.218
In temperatures up to
300 degrees fahrenheit.

09:56.487 --> 09:59.856
So you need a
flashlight on the sun?

09:59.891 --> 10:02.059
The surface temperature of the sun

10:02.093 --> 10:05.861
Is 9,944.33 degrees.

10:07.164 --> 10:09.831
If you want it to hurt,
you gotta be accurate.

10:12.035 --> 10:14.436
tech-noggin, does that
baby have a camera in it?

10:14.471 --> 10:16.338
How 'bout you get a shot
of me and the ladies?

10:16.372 --> 10:19.007
Did you just say something?

10:19.041 --> 10:22.445
No. Alex, did you
just say something?

10:22.479 --> 10:24.680
No, I was hoping you did.

10:24.715 --> 10:26.982
what's with the confusion,
tweeners?

10:27.017 --> 10:28.650
It was me, cab 804.

10:31.754 --> 10:33.921
You used magic to
bring the cab to life.

10:33.956 --> 10:36.190
Alex, I'm new to magic,

10:36.225 --> 10:38.226
With a tng c I'm not
sure if I should scream

10:38.260 --> 10:39.327
Or just run away.

10:39.361 --> 10:40.461
So, I'm going to faint.

10:41.463 --> 10:43.097
Catch me, justin.

10:48.697 --> 10:50.031
Oh!

10:50.065 --> 10:53.667
What was so confusing about,
"catch me, justin?"

10:53.702 --> 10:57.203
Sorry. I'm a little distracted
by the magic talking cab.

10:57.238 --> 10:59.372
Hey, I got distracted
by commander gadget

10:59.406 --> 11:01.508
Letting the cute girl take
a header into the cement.

11:01.542 --> 11:05.178
Oh, thank you.

11:05.212 --> 11:08.047
Relax, justin. It's no big deal.

11:08.082 --> 11:11.150
A lot of times these things
happen to me when I use magic.

11:11.184 --> 11:13.619
We're just not going to
tell anybody about it.

11:13.653 --> 11:15.754
See, harper. This is how it works.

11:15.788 --> 11:18.223
Alex messes something up and
then I gotta fix it for her.

11:18.257 --> 11:20.324
You're not gonna have to
come and fix it for me

11:20.359 --> 11:22.626
Because I have
everything under control.

11:22.727 --> 11:25.996
hey, new york, alex russo
brought me back to life!

11:26.031 --> 11:29.767
Let's celebrate! Garcon,
round of wiper fluid for everyone!

11:29.801 --> 11:32.403
Go ahead, ask for help.

11:32.437 --> 11:36.140
Car alarm. Just the car alarm.

11:36.175 --> 11:38.442
- Don't need it.
- Yeah.

11:38.477 --> 11:41.346
Alex russo, from being
born in my back seat

11:41.380 --> 11:43.949
15 years ago to
saving my life today,

11:43.983 --> 11:46.752
We're more than friends.
We're family!

11:46.786 --> 11:49.554
I already have all
the family I need.

11:49.589 --> 11:51.622
In fact, I think one
member too many.

11:51.657 --> 11:53.458
You know who we're talking about.

11:53.492 --> 11:55.293
I like the cut of your jib.

11:55.394 --> 11:58.296
Good luck hiding your
giant magic talking cab.

11:58.331 --> 12:01.233
And I know who
you're talking about.

12:01.267 --> 12:03.969
And max is going to be very
disappointed when I tell him.

12:05.171 --> 12:07.305
alex, you saved my life.

12:07.340 --> 12:10.175
I feel like I got that
new car smell again.

12:10.209 --> 12:11.642
I want to pay you back.

12:11.844 --> 12:13.577
How 'bout I give you a
ride to school tomorrow?

12:13.612 --> 12:15.546
I won't put my meter on. Free ride.

12:15.580 --> 12:16.847
You can't turn that down.

12:17.181 --> 12:21.217
This cab knows me.
I can't turn that down.

12:25.522 --> 12:27.490
See, riding in the cab was awesome.

12:27.524 --> 12:29.258
And we're even not that late.

12:29.294 --> 12:32.528
We missed two periods.

12:32.562 --> 12:35.630
Uh, ok, fine. You're late.

12:35.664 --> 12:37.898
This is when I usually get here.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.368
Oh, well.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.538
Hey, alex. Say, harper.

12:46.573 --> 12:48.473
I was thinking you saved my life

12:48.674 --> 12:52.576
And it meant so much more to me
than just a free ride to school.

12:52.611 --> 12:55.678
Do you like tacos?

12:55.713 --> 12:57.480
Stand next to it.
Maybe it will blend in.

13:02.286 --> 13:06.421
Wow. Magic talking
cab in tribeca prep.

13:06.455 --> 13:08.756
Yep, you've got it
all under control.

13:08.857 --> 13:11.926
We can't possibly explain what
this magic cab's doing here.

13:11.960 --> 13:12.960
What's your plan?

13:12.994 --> 13:14.595
I'm thinking of one.

13:14.629 --> 13:16.931
I've got one. I'll see ya in p.E.

13:22.503 --> 13:24.370
Hello, everyone.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.071
I know what you're thinking.

13:26.506 --> 13:31.008
That is one honking big art
project I brought into school.

13:31.043 --> 13:32.476
I'm not an art project.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.811
I'm a talking magic cab.

13:34.845 --> 13:36.745
Or an art project.

13:36.780 --> 13:38.647
I'll stop talking.

13:41.383 --> 13:45.018
I've never heard of alex
russo turning in a project.

13:45.053 --> 13:48.321
Hmm... I wonder where all the
other cab art projects are,

13:48.355 --> 13:51.690
From the cab art class.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.560
hate you.

13:55.595 --> 13:59.764
the words I'm looking
for are "help me."

14:01.567 --> 14:02.834
Ok, fine. Help me.

14:02.868 --> 14:04.501
All right.

14:04.536 --> 14:08.237
A lot of you know my sister as a snarky,
apathetic slacker...

14:09.973 --> 14:13.409
But the truth is, this cab,
along with other cars

14:13.443 --> 14:15.611
We hope you'll encourage
your parents to donate,

14:15.645 --> 14:18.847
Will be used to create an
artificial reef habitat

14:18.881 --> 14:21.382
In the hudson river
for homeless otters.

14:21.416 --> 14:23.350
very nice.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.352
Thank you.

14:26.521 --> 14:28.889
Thank you. I don't
know what happened.

14:28.923 --> 14:30.523
The cab won't leave me alone.

14:30.758 --> 14:32.625
When you bring an
inanimate object to life

14:32.659 --> 14:34.324
It develops an attachment to you.

14:34.359 --> 14:36.592
Wow. Where did you
learn all that from?

14:36.626 --> 14:39.794
From the magical place of
listening to dad when he teaches.

14:39.828 --> 14:42.430
I used to talk like
that like three years a

14:42.465 --> 14:43.500
But I don't anymore.

14:44.699 --> 14:46.833
Gosh! You've got me doing it again!

14:56.645 --> 14:58.913
man, you drive like
I've got four flats.

14:58.947 --> 15:01.482
Shh! You'll wake up
the dispatch guy.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.895
Look, the car is back and
the dispatch guy is asleep.

15:13.929 --> 15:15.897
- The problem is over.
- no, it's not.

15:15.932 --> 15:18.200
I'm the dream you'll
never wake up from.

15:18.234 --> 15:21.003
I've known you since
the day you were born.

15:22.105 --> 15:23.606
Let's chain him up.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.808
I hope you're talking
about snow chains.

15:25.976 --> 15:28.978
I have a better idea.
Why don't we just take out his key?

15:29.012 --> 15:31.414
No, no, no! Not the key.

15:31.448 --> 15:34.685
Don't take out the key.

15:34.718 --> 15:36.286
Wait a minute,

15:36.320 --> 15:38.221
I used a spell to
bring the cab to life,

15:38.255 --> 15:40.091
But you take out the ke?

15:41.426 --> 15:43.159
Yup. Movin' on...

15:53.636 --> 15:55.270
What's wrong, max?

15:55.304 --> 15:57.104
You've hardly touched your dinner.

15:58.173 --> 16:00.339
I miss my gurney.

16:04.010 --> 16:06.511
Well, you did the right
thing by returning it.

16:06.545 --> 16:09.513
And we did the right thing
by telling you to return it.

16:11.483 --> 16:13.183
And here it is...

16:13.218 --> 16:15.219
...By itself...

16:15.254 --> 16:18.321
...With no one pushing it.

16:21.692 --> 16:23.726
It came back?

16:24.260 --> 16:25.894
How?

16:25.928 --> 16:28.096
Well, I...

16:28.130 --> 16:30.164
I didn't feel like
pushing it all the way.

16:30.198 --> 16:33.134
So, I did some magic on
it and brought it to life,

16:33.168 --> 16:34.935
So it could push itself.

16:35.136 --> 16:39.439
don't you know when you
bring an inanimate object

16:39.473 --> 16:42.743
To life it develops
an attachment to you?

16:45.546 --> 16:49.049
you are incredible.

16:52.653 --> 16:56.656
Max russo, we are very
disappointed in you.

16:56.690 --> 16:59.025
Your sister is right.

16:59.059 --> 17:02.094
Which is weird.

17:02.129 --> 17:04.998
Jerry, this isn't about how
right or weird alex is.

17:05.031 --> 17:08.034
This is about max and
his now magical gurney.

17:08.069 --> 17:11.503
And how he's going to finish
his dinner in his room.

17:24.784 --> 17:26.785
Well, I'll see you in p.E.

17:31.692 --> 17:33.559
Wow. That car horn sounds like

17:33.594 --> 17:35.495
It's coming from
outside the terrace.

17:35.529 --> 17:36.929
- Oh...
- Have you heard about

17:37.364 --> 17:39.165
The tribeca prep homeless
otter reef project?

17:39.199 --> 17:41.935
alex! You may have taken my keys,

17:44.405 --> 17:47.808
That's a guy from school.
His name's burt.

17:47.842 --> 17:49.910
He likes me but I don't
think he's getting the hint

17:49.944 --> 17:52.346
That I'm not interested!

17:52.380 --> 17:57.184
Alex, I see what's going on here.

17:57.218 --> 17:59.619
You're bringing your
problems home to discuss

17:59.653 --> 18:01.287
Instead of scheming about them.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.592
Oh, well, that's
very mature of you.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.460
No wonder this boy
likes you so much.

18:07.495 --> 18:09.795
But you should give
him back those keys.

18:09.830 --> 18:12.131
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

18:13.334 --> 18:17.136
She is growing up to be
a very fine young woman.

18:17.171 --> 18:20.640
She is unbelievable.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.845
Harper, you're acting like
you're looking at a ufo.

18:26.879 --> 18:28.880
It's just a flying cab. Relax.

18:28.914 --> 18:31.349
hey, alex.
Are those copper gutters?

18:31.384 --> 18:32.818
I'm up here.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.954
Yeah, I know where you are.
You've got to come down

18:34.988 --> 18:36.722
Before people start to notice.

18:37.191 --> 18:39.659
I know. We'll tell everybody
it's a parade balloon.

18:39.693 --> 18:41.927
Where's the rope?

18:41.962 --> 18:43.229
Uh... Right here.

18:43.396 --> 18:46.065
Yeah, it's like very thin,
super strong.

18:46.099 --> 18:49.001
It's the latest thing in parade
balloon rope technologies.

18:49.035 --> 18:50.536
It's good. Check it out.

18:50.570 --> 18:52.838
alex, you've got to listen to me.

18:52.872 --> 18:54.672
I want to protect you from trouble.

18:54.707 --> 18:57.108
No. You've got to listen to me.

18:57.142 --> 18:59.576
You've got to stop talking.
You've got to stop flying.

18:59.611 --> 19:01.312
And thenou've got to get over me.

19:01.313 --> 19:03.780
Wait, hold thi

19:08.652 --> 19:10.754
Rope from greenwald's, help me now.

19:10.788 --> 19:14.590
Climb up there a tie a bough...
Bow... Bough.

19:14.624 --> 19:17.126
Oh, you know what I mean.
Rope, do your thing.

19:24.067 --> 19:25.734
alex!

19:25.768 --> 19:28.203
I'll go see where she went.

19:30.206 --> 19:32.407
oh, would you...

19:32.441 --> 19:33.875
Thank you.

19:36.712 --> 19:39.513
Would you... Thank you.

19:45.455 --> 19:48.122
oh! There you are.

19:48.156 --> 19:50.491
I was worried you might
be having boy trouble.

19:52.527 --> 19:55.730
Uh, nope. All done.
And speaking of boys,

19:55.764 --> 19:57.799
Did you know they're
making parade balloons

19:58.234 --> 20:02.571
More real these days? Try and
remember that if that comes up, ever.

20:02.605 --> 20:05.040
So, uh, how's it going with burt?

20:05.074 --> 20:07.042
No, no. It's none of my business.

20:08.378 --> 20:10.646
No. Yes, it is my business.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.748
Uh, eat. Everything's
under control.

20:22.693 --> 20:25.728
thank goodness my lamp's ok.

20:32.068 --> 20:33.969
Oh, my goodness!

20:34.003 --> 20:37.305
A realistic parade
balloon broke free!

20:38.641 --> 20:41.410
I will not be ignored, alex russo!

20:41.443 --> 20:43.178
Well, not when you do that.

20:43.212 --> 20:46.114
There's a...

20:46.149 --> 20:48.584
Max... Gurney... Alex... Cab!

20:50.753 --> 20:53.055
You know how sometimes
you use magic,

20:53.089 --> 20:55.124
When you're not supposed to,
but for something good,

20:55.158 --> 20:56.358
And it makes people happy?

20:56.393 --> 20:58.928
Do I look happy?

20:58.962 --> 21:01.430
Does anyone look happy?

21:01.465 --> 21:04.133
It's not alex's fault.
It's my fault.

21:04.167 --> 21:06.602
I only wanted to protect alex,

21:06.636 --> 21:08.837
To thank her for
bringing me back to life.

21:08.872 --> 21:13.442
You brought cab 804 to life?

21:13.476 --> 21:15.277
For good reason.

21:15.312 --> 21:17.079
You, dad, and eryone were so upset

21:17.114 --> 21:19.181
That cab 8 was going to be retired.

21:19.216 --> 21:20.917
Uh, I go by burt.

21:20.951 --> 21:24.687
I just wanted it to be ok,
and for it not to beone.

21:24.721 --> 21:27.890
honey,

21:27.925 --> 21:32.328
Just because something is
gone and we're sad about it,

21:32.363 --> 21:35.131
Doesn't mean you should try
do anything to bri it back.

21:35.165 --> 21:39.602
I mean, missing something is part
of what makes it a great memory.

21:41.738 --> 21:43.005
I'm sorry.

21:43.039 --> 21:45.874
I'm sorry for charming the cab

21:45.909 --> 21:48.978
And having him crash
into our living room.

21:49.012 --> 21:50.946
I'm rey for my punishment, daddy.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.314
Come he.

21:54.884 --> 21:57.052
Is that a punishment?

21:57.086 --> 22:00.889
No, it's an alex-ment.

22:00.924 --> 22:04.293
Something that should be a
punishment but is a reward.

22:04.327 --> 22:06.695
You get those sometimes, right?

22:07.897 --> 22:11.567
No. No, I don't.
