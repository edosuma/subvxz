Sweet.

01:02.551 --> 01:04.413
Hi, my name is Baaba,
nice to meet you.

01:04.448 --> 01:05.620
You must be rich.

01:05.655 --> 01:06.620
Well, my boyfriend isn't rich,

01:06.655 --> 01:08.344
but you are definitely rich.

01:08.379 --> 01:09.655
Are you single?

01:09.689 --> 01:11.827
Well, she's not single,
but she's single.

01:11.862 --> 01:13.137
I'm well, I'm...

01:13.172 --> 01:14.586
- Baaba!
- What? What?

01:14.620 --> 01:15.551
Just get in.

01:15.586 --> 01:16.413
Okay, yeah.

01:16.448 --> 01:17.275
Well, yeah, nice.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.655
Yes, it's nice.

01:18.689 --> 01:19.517
Open it.

01:19.551 --> 01:20.517
It's locked.

01:20.551 --> 01:21.827
It's locked.

01:21.862 --> 01:22.689
Oh! Oh!

01:27.137 --> 01:28.275
Now why did he leave?

01:28.310 --> 01:29.241
Learn to keep your
mouth shut, Baaba.

01:29.275 --> 01:30.344
You talk too much.

01:30.379 --> 01:31.517
I talk too much?

01:31.551 --> 01:32.724
I told you not to
talk to me like that.

01:33.724 --> 01:34.517
You pay bills when I talk.

01:34.551 --> 01:35.724
Do you pay bills?

01:35.758 --> 01:36.689
Do any of you pay
bills when I talk?

01:36.724 --> 01:37.655
Eh?

01:37.689 --> 01:39.413
Do you pay bills when I talk?

01:39.448 --> 01:41.724
blah-ba-la-la-la-la-lo-lo-lo-lo!

01:41.758 --> 01:43.827
This is talking too much.

01:43.862 --> 01:45.586
Say I talk too much.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.172
Oh, there's a car coming.

01:49.206 --> 01:51.137
Now run, move.
Go, go, go, go!

02:00.310 --> 02:01.448
Hey, come back, o'.

02:01.482 --> 02:04.241

06:08.068 --> 06:12.206

06:12.241 --> 06:15.448
You see, Pokua, Baaba and Fella,

06:15.482 --> 06:17.586

You're looking good.

07:13.689 --> 07:14.827
Thank you.

07:14.862 --> 07:16.551
Anyway, what
are you doing here?

07:16.586 --> 07:17.827
Oh, my friends
and I have opened

07:17.862 --> 07:20.172
a small ushering business.

07:20.206 --> 07:21.172
That's good.

07:21.206 --> 07:21.827
And we're here
to share flyers.

07:21.862 --> 07:22.586
That's good.

07:22.620 --> 07:23.689
Oh, wow.

07:23.724 --> 07:25.689
And what are you
also doing here?

07:25.724 --> 07:27.241
I, I, I...

07:27.275 --> 07:29.068
You see, you see my office
is just around here,

07:29.103 --> 07:30.758
I came for a business meeting.

07:30.793 --> 07:32.172
I'm just leaving.

07:34.172 --> 07:35.551
Anyway, let me excuse myself.

07:35.586 --> 07:37.241
See you around, okay?

07:37.275 --> 07:38.103
Okay.

07:38.137 --> 07:39.551
Have a nice day.

07:52.241 --> 07:53.206
Pokua! Pokua!

07:53.241 --> 07:55.482
?

07:55.517 --> 07:56.344
Let me tell you.

07:56.379 --> 07:57.275
She has to know.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.655
It's none of your business!

07:58.689 --> 08:00.344
If there's any trouble,
I am not part of it,

08:00.379 --> 08:01.310
I told you to not to do it.

08:01.344 --> 08:02.172
It's not.
Please go.

08:02.206 --> 08:03.103
Do you understand?

08:03.137 --> 08:03.793
What?

08:03.827 --> 08:04.827
Okay, just...

08:04.862 --> 08:06.310
I had nothing to do with this.

08:06.344 --> 08:07.379
If there's any trouble, I-
She has to know.

08:07.413 --> 08:08.241
Just go.

08:08.275 --> 08:09.586
Hey, hey!

08:10.482 --> 08:11.344
Hi, Pokua.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.448
How are you doing?

08:13.482 --> 08:14.448
- Very well.
- Yeah.

08:14.482 --> 08:15.413
Come on, come on in.

08:15.448 --> 08:16.689
- No.
- No.

08:16.724 --> 08:19.655
Auntie Vero, I suspect your
husband is cheating on you.

08:20.862 --> 08:22.482
I didn't like what I saw today.

08:24.448 --> 08:27.137
I thought you should know so
you can keep an eye on him.

08:32.793 --> 08:34.413
Auntie Vero, maybe you
didn't hear what I said.

08:34.448 --> 08:35.379
Oh, I heard you.

08:36.344 --> 08:38.034
That's no news.

08:38.068 --> 08:41.034
So many people tell
me this all the time,

08:41.068 --> 08:42.724
but he denies them all.

08:43.862 --> 08:47.137
It does haunt me,
but I have no proof

08:47.172 --> 08:49.448
so I just pretend that
it's not happening

08:50.310 --> 08:52.034
and that's how I deal.

08:52.068 --> 08:53.689
Auntie Vero, we're so sorry.

08:57.310 --> 08:58.793
Eh?
Congratulations,

09:00.689 --> 09:02.241
reporter.

09:04.724 --> 09:06.172
There must be
something we can do.

09:06.206 --> 09:07.413
Listen, Pokua,

09:07.448 --> 09:09.241
this woman is suffering
enough torture already,

09:09.275 --> 09:10.448
leave her alone!

09:10.482 --> 09:12.206
Yes, she is.

09:12.241 --> 09:13.586
Yes, she is.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.413
But that's why I want to help.

09:15.448 --> 09:17.137
We need to free her mind.

09:17.172 --> 09:18.068
She has to know the truth.

09:18.103 --> 09:19.068
Free her mind from what?

09:19.103 --> 09:19.724
Truth, truth.
Everyday, truth.

09:19.758 --> 09:21.103
What truth, Pokua?

09:21.137 --> 09:22.034
You're the only one
who knows this truth.

09:22.068 --> 09:23.551
Pokua, let's just leave her be.

09:23.586 --> 09:25.172
I mean, she's living her life-
Eh?

09:25.206 --> 09:26.137
She's happy.

09:26.172 --> 09:27.448
Pokua, what else do you want?

09:27.482 --> 09:29.793
She's not who?
She's not happy.

09:29.827 --> 09:31.275
Didn't you see
the way she talks?

09:31.310 --> 09:32.379
The way she banged her door?

09:32.413 --> 09:34.068
She's definitely not happy.

09:35.344 --> 09:37.413
Look, I'm a married woman too.

09:37.448 --> 09:38.310
- Oh.
- Eh.

09:38.344 --> 09:39.448
Okay.

09:39.482 --> 09:40.827
I see it when
another is in trouble.

09:40.862 --> 09:41.793
I see it.

09:41.827 --> 09:43.344
Okay, madam married woman,

09:43.379 --> 09:45.172
tell us, what should
we do to help?

09:46.517 --> 09:49.551
I heard him say he'll
pick her tomorrow at 2:00.

09:49.586 --> 09:51.068
We can go with Auntie
Vero so she finds out.

09:51.103 --> 09:51.827
Mm-hmm.

09:51.862 --> 09:52.793
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

09:52.827 --> 09:53.827
- Hey, no!
- No.

09:53.862 --> 09:55.310
- Leave me out of this.
- Mm-hmm.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.172
This is insane.

09:56.206 --> 09:57.827
I want no part of this.

09:57.862 --> 09:58.689
Do you understand?

09:58.724 --> 09:59.655
Count me out.

09:59.689 --> 10:00.827
Did you think about this?

10:00.862 --> 10:02.275
Pokua, she's right.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.137
That's such a...

10:03.172 --> 10:04.344
That's an awful idea.

10:04.379 --> 10:06.103
That's the only
thing on my mind.

10:06.137 --> 10:07.517
I don't know how
to give her proof.

10:07.551 --> 10:10.413
But maybe
there's something else

10:10.448 --> 10:11.344
we can do.

10:11.379 --> 10:12.827
Okay, okay, okay.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.344
How do we get proof?

10:16.448 --> 10:17.551
Pokua,

10:19.379 --> 10:21.034
do you know what
you're asking for?

10:21.068 --> 10:22.379
Yes, I do.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.827
Are
you that heartless?

10:24.862 --> 10:26.724
No, I am not!

10:26.758 --> 10:28.103
I am not.

10:28.137 --> 10:29.310
How did we even
become friends?

10:29.344 --> 10:30.517
Babs!

10:30.551 --> 10:31.724
Oh, oh, you too, you
agree with this, eh?

10:31.758 --> 10:35.172
Not entirely, but you
people shouting and screaming,

10:35.206 --> 10:36.689
it's not going to
solve anything.

10:36.724 --> 10:38.724
Just bring your voices down.

10:38.758 --> 10:40.137
Okay.

10:40.172 --> 10:43.034
I understand how this
is a problem for you.

10:43.068 --> 10:44.413
I can handle it myself.

10:44.448 --> 10:46.000
Help is all I want to give.

10:47.137 --> 10:47.793
Pokua!

10:47.827 --> 10:48.655
I'll go.

10:50.310 --> 10:51.689
She's right.

10:51.724 --> 10:54.206
I mean, it's gonna cause
a whole lot of drama

10:54.241 --> 10:56.413
and you don't want that scene.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.068
But I have an idea.

10:59.103 --> 11:01.275
I mean, if it's really
going to help her,

11:01.310 --> 11:04.034
maybe we can just
record him secretly.

11:04.068 --> 11:06.137
If we get him like once
or twice on camera,

11:06.172 --> 11:06.827
that's proof, right?

11:06.862 --> 11:08.172
Hmm.

11:08.206 --> 11:09.137
Hmm.

11:09.172 --> 11:10.310
You have money for camera?

11:10.344 --> 11:11.275
Oh, we can use
our phone camera.

11:11.310 --> 11:12.379
Our phone camera will be fine.

11:12.413 --> 11:13.517
And that easy, right?

11:13.551 --> 11:14.689
Just gonna record him?

11:14.724 --> 11:17.241
It was just a
suggestion, like...

11:17.275 --> 11:18.689
Hmm.

11:18.724 --> 11:21.551
Okay, if you wish not to
be in, fine, we carry on.

11:21.586 --> 11:22.448
Baaba? Baab?

11:23.482 --> 11:24.758
Baaba?

11:24.793 --> 11:26.827
See, look, eh,

11:26.862 --> 11:27.827
my next friendship, yeah,

11:27.862 --> 11:30.137
I'm going to make sure
that there's a contract

11:30.172 --> 11:33.413
so I can get out whenever I
feel like it without any guilt.

11:33.448 --> 11:34.689
Ah, this friendship
thing is hard.

11:34.724 --> 11:36.689
And now by force, I have
to go and do this thing

11:36.724 --> 11:37.758
and I don't want to do.

11:37.793 --> 11:38.689
No!

11:38.724 --> 11:39.827
Next time, I'm serious,

11:39.862 --> 11:42.206
we are signing contracts
so I can get out.

11:42.241 --> 11:43.275
It's okay.

11:43.310 --> 11:45.793
And this better be worth it.

11:47.103 --> 11:48.689
.

11:48.724 --> 11:51.827
Go!

11:51.862 --> 11:52.827
Guys!

11:52.862 --> 11:54.137
Hey, I want the front.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.103
I want the front.

11:55.137 --> 11:56.551
Give me the front!

11:56.586 --> 11:57.413
Front!

12:14.655 --> 12:19.103
V, what is going on here?

12:19.862 --> 12:21.413
What's happening?

12:26.068 --> 12:26.758
Jesus.

12:31.862 --> 12:34.172
Stand here and talk to me.

12:36.586 --> 12:38.172
V, look at you.

12:40.724 --> 12:43.275
Sweetheart, what has you
working you up like this?

12:43.310 --> 12:44.689
Are you cheating on me?

12:44.724 --> 12:49.172
What?

12:54.586 --> 12:56.689
Oh,,

12:56.724 --> 12:58.103
.

12:58.137 --> 13:00.655
Sweetheart, did
you just ask that?

13:01.827 --> 13:02.758
I've lost count
of the many times

13:02.793 --> 13:03.620
you've asked this question.

13:03.655 --> 13:05.517
Just answer me.

13:05.551 --> 13:06.482
Are you cheating?

13:06.517 --> 13:08.275
No!

13:08.310 --> 13:09.551
How could I?

13:10.551 --> 13:11.413
Never.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.724
Tell me, where from this?

13:14.758 --> 13:17.275
, I told you

13:17.310 --> 13:19.034
that the next time
I get a report

13:19.068 --> 13:21.551
that you're cheating on
me, I won't ask for proof,

13:21.586 --> 13:23.034
I will just walk away.

13:23.068 --> 13:25.758
Too many people can't be
reporting the same lie.

13:25.793 --> 13:27.689
It's just not possible.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.275
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

13:29.310 --> 13:32.000
Sweetheart, it means someone
came to report me again?

13:32.862 --> 13:34.034
I see.

13:34.068 --> 13:35.241
And are you breaking your mind

13:35.275 --> 13:37.551
because of what
you have not seen?

13:37.586 --> 13:39.068
Goodness!

13:39.103 --> 13:41.206
I've asked you to stop
listening to people

13:41.241 --> 13:43.034
because they envy our marriage.

13:43.068 --> 13:44.413
In case you want
to walk out of this

13:44.448 --> 13:47.724
maybe 'cause you are tired
of me, then so be it,

13:47.758 --> 13:52.137
but don't blame it
on unfounded hearsay.

13:52.172 --> 13:54.655
Sweetie, when I step out there,

13:54.689 --> 13:56.551
there are a lot of pretty girls,

13:56.586 --> 14:01.413
even some of them are married
women who try to hit on me

14:01.448 --> 14:03.310
but I refuse them.

14:03.344 --> 14:04.448
You know why?

14:04.482 --> 14:07.448
It's because I
respect our marriage.

14:09.862 --> 14:12.275
Unless I forget, what
do we have for dinner?

14:32.862 --> 14:34.172
This is the plan,

14:34.206 --> 14:35.689
the two of you will
do the recording.

14:35.724 --> 14:38.413
I can't be part,
he'll recognize me.

14:38.448 --> 14:42.551
When his car arrives, walk
towards it and pretend to chat.

14:42.586 --> 14:44.137
But hold on.

14:44.172 --> 14:46.620
So how would you have pulled
this off if we pulled out?

14:46.655 --> 14:47.827
I haven't thought about that.

14:47.862 --> 14:49.310
I know you'll never leave me.

14:49.344 --> 14:50.620
Hmm?

14:50.655 --> 14:52.275
The lady will come from here.

14:52.310 --> 14:55.655
Turn your backs towards them
and hold your phones casually.

14:55.689 --> 14:57.206
No direct cameras.

14:57.241 --> 14:58.689
See, this thing is very risky.

14:58.724 --> 15:00.620
I can't believe we're
about to do this.

15:00.655 --> 15:02.310
I can't believe I got
myself involved in this.

15:02.344 --> 15:03.724
Baaba!

15:03.758 --> 15:05.724
I thought we all agreed
that we're gonna do this.

15:05.758 --> 15:07.379
And I'm not saying
I'm pulling out,

15:07.413 --> 15:09.586
I'm just telling
you that it's risky.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.137
He's here.

15:11.172 --> 15:12.068
He's here.

15:13.793 --> 15:15.413
And Fella, you first.
Okay.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.344
Let's go.

15:19.862 --> 15:20.758
Baaba?

15:20.793 --> 15:21.862
Yeah?

15:21.896 --> 15:23.448
When the lady's approaching
the car, call her,

15:24.793 --> 15:27.655
she'll stop, get closer
and start a conversation.

15:27.689 --> 15:29.275
Okay.

15:29.310 --> 15:30.137
Get closer.

15:30.172 --> 15:31.137
Get closer.

15:31.172 --> 15:34.379
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm going. I'm going.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.551
Fella!

15:37.586 --> 15:38.482
Baabs!

15:40.310 --> 15:42.241
Oh my goodness!

15:42.275 --> 15:43.103
How are you?

15:43.137 --> 15:44.034
I'm great.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.241
Baabs, how long has it been?

15:45.275 --> 15:47.172
Ah, it's been
a very long time.

15:47.206 --> 15:48.655
- Many years.
- Yes!

15:49.862 --> 15:51.413
You're looking good.

15:51.448 --> 15:53.206
Oh, thank you, it's
through the grace of God.

15:53.241 --> 15:54.241
Oh, gosh.

15:59.206 --> 16:00.034
- Yeah, okay-
- Yeah.

16:00.068 --> 16:01.241
So I came for a walk.

16:01.275 --> 16:02.103
A walk?

16:02.137 --> 16:03.034
Yes.

16:03.068 --> 16:04.448
Yes, it's very breezy, yeah.

16:04.482 --> 16:06.206
Yeah, it's nice, plenty birds-

16:06.241 --> 16:07.103
Yeah.

16:07.137 --> 16:08.206
- Lots of air.
- Oh.

16:08.241 --> 16:09.172
Yeah.

16:09.206 --> 16:10.551
- Ah.
- Oh, Fella!

16:12.724 --> 16:13.551
Baabs, oh.

16:13.586 --> 16:14.413
Yeah, Fella.

16:14.448 --> 16:15.586
It's good to see you.

16:15.620 --> 16:16.827
- Oh, good to see you too.
- Yeah.

16:16.862 --> 16:18.448
Good to see you.

16:19.724 --> 16:20.586
Baabs.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.689
What?

16:22.724 --> 16:24.172
- They kissed.
- They what?

16:24.206 --> 16:25.344
No, no, no, no, no, not here.

16:25.379 --> 16:26.275
Where did they kiss?

16:26.310 --> 16:27.206
On the lips, mwah, mwah.

16:27.241 --> 16:28.172
On the lips?
Really?

16:28.206 --> 16:28.724
- Mm-hmm.
- What-

16:35.103 --> 16:36.241
They kissed.

16:38.448 --> 16:39.310
And look.

16:40.551 --> 16:42.068
They kissed!

16:46.862 --> 16:50.827
Auntie Vero, we caught
him, your husband.

16:50.862 --> 16:52.517
We have a proof of him cheating.

16:53.724 --> 16:55.103
Why are you doing this?

16:55.827 --> 16:57.137
I'm a wife too.

16:58.379 --> 17:00.724
I can't stand the torture of
hearing my husband is cheating.

17:00.758 --> 17:04.655
I thought I should expose
him to free your conscience.

17:04.689 --> 17:08.137
I don't like it when you
see wrong and go quiet.

17:14.379 --> 17:15.620
Let me see it.

17:15.655 --> 17:17.724
Okay, okay, show, show.

17:21.172 --> 17:22.379
Looking good.

17:22.413 --> 17:23.482
Oh, thank you, it's
through the grace of God.

17:23.517 --> 17:25.689
Oh, God.

17:28.758 --> 17:30.103
Auntie Vero?

17:31.310 --> 17:32.379
- For a walk.
- A walk?

17:32.413 --> 17:36.137
- Yeah.
- Please, are you okay?

17:36.172 --> 17:37.310
Plenty birds, yeah.

17:38.275 --> 17:43.275
Yeah.

17:44.413 --> 17:48.689
Auntie Vero,
please say something.

17:48.724 --> 17:49.827
Do you think we made her cry?

17:49.862 --> 17:52.068
No.
She decided to cry on her own.

17:52.103 --> 17:55.413
She saw a video of her
husband cheating and cried.

17:55.448 --> 17:57.103
Look, look guys, let's just...

17:57.137 --> 17:58.551
Let's just go, okay?

17:58.586 --> 18:00.724
I mean, clearly the woman
is in a lot of pain,

18:00.758 --> 18:02.379
let's give her some space.

18:02.413 --> 18:03.551
This was a bad idea.

18:07.413 --> 18:11.724
Here, have this.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.000
What for?

18:18.862 --> 18:20.344
It's your reward.

18:20.379 --> 18:21.379
Oh, no, no, no.

18:21.413 --> 18:25.241
No, Auntie Vero, you
don't have to pay us.

18:25.275 --> 18:26.655
Mm-hmm.

18:26.689 --> 18:30.206
You know, anyone could
have done this for me too.

18:31.379 --> 18:34.551
I've been so unhappy
the past three years,

18:34.586 --> 18:37.482
so thank you
for giving me this freedom.

18:41.172 --> 18:43.482
I'm just tired of
living in oblivion.

18:45.103 --> 18:45.793
And here,

18:47.517 --> 18:49.379
put the video on this.

18:51.758 --> 18:53.310
Just put it on.

19:00.689 --> 19:02.517
- Miss, we are so sorry.
- Sorry, Auntie Vero.

19:02.551 --> 19:04.034
We're sorry.

19:04.068 --> 19:05.655
Thank you,
through the grace of God.

19:08.620 --> 19:10.482
We may go now.

19:10.517 --> 19:11.655
We shouldn't of done this.

19:11.689 --> 19:12.586
Oh, okay.

19:12.620 --> 19:13.758
So I came for a walk.

19:13.793 --> 19:16.068
- A walk?
- Yes.

19:17.413 --> 19:19.034
It's
nice, plenty birds-

19:19.068 --> 19:20.206
- Yeah.
- Lots of air.

19:20.241 --> 19:21.724
- Oh!
- Yeah.

19:46.172 --> 19:47.034
V?

19:56.137 --> 19:57.000
V!

19:59.206 --> 20:03.758
V for Vero.

20:08.586 --> 20:09.448
V!

20:12.586 --> 20:14.034
Honey, I'm home!

20:15.413 --> 20:17.000
Where's this wife?

20:17.758 --> 20:18.620
VV!

20:20.862 --> 20:23.586
V, darling!

20:23.620 --> 20:24.482
Ah.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.655
Thank you,
through the grace of God.

20:57.689 --> 20:59.310
Oh, gosh.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.689
- Yeah, okay-
- Yeah.

21:04.724 --> 21:06.068
So I came for a walk.

21:06.103 --> 21:07.103
- A walk?
- Yes.

21:07.137 --> 21:09.034
Yes,
it's very breezy, yeah.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.551
Yeah, it's nice,
there's plenty birds-

21:10.586 --> 21:12.172
- Yeah.
- Lots of-

21:12.206 --> 21:13.344
♪ Get it, get it, get it,
get it, get it, get it ♪

21:13.379 --> 21:15.448
This is a lot of money.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.620
Yeah, it is.

21:20.241 --> 21:22.137
We should split it.

21:22.172 --> 21:24.137
Yeah, everybody takes their cut.

21:24.172 --> 21:25.448
I mean, whatever you wanna do
with it is your business, but-

21:25.482 --> 21:26.310
No, no, no.

21:26.344 --> 21:27.655
No, no.

21:27.689 --> 21:30.310
Let's open a proper
ushering agency,

21:30.344 --> 21:31.827
you know, with a registered
office and everything.

21:31.862 --> 21:33.724
Think about it, Pokbafell.

21:36.172 --> 21:38.655
Vuh.
The F is silent.

21:38.689 --> 21:39.586
Vuh.

21:39.620 --> 21:41.206
You know what, it makes sense.

21:41.241 --> 21:42.517
Yeah.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.068
Pokua, are you here?

21:45.103 --> 21:45.827
Of course, I'm here.

21:45.862 --> 21:47.758
Okay, so what's your take?

21:47.793 --> 21:49.724
I think I need some
time to think through.

21:49.758 --> 21:52.172
Okay, let's all take
some time to think through.

21:52.206 --> 21:53.413
Yep.

21:53.448 --> 21:55.172
But you know what?
I think it's perfect.

21:55.206 --> 21:56.034
Yes!

22:09.862 --> 22:10.724
Ow!

22:28.517 --> 22:30.034
Honey?

22:30.068 --> 22:31.172
Get my phone!

22:36.758 --> 22:37.620
Yeah.

22:41.758 --> 22:43.275
Um-mm.
Not ready.

22:44.586 --> 22:46.517
Hi, is this Pokua?

22:46.551 --> 22:47.379
That smells good.

22:47.413 --> 22:48.344
Shh, shh.

22:49.517 --> 22:51.413
Yes, Pokua here.

22:51.448 --> 22:52.551
Vero tells
me you helped her

22:52.586 --> 22:54.137
catch her cheating husband.

22:54.172 --> 22:55.689
Can you help me too?

22:57.310 --> 22:58.482
Pardon?

22:58.517 --> 22:59.758
I suspect my
husband is cheating.

22:59.793 --> 23:02.034
I want proof to face him.

23:03.172 --> 23:04.689
A friend also suspects
her boyfriend,

23:04.724 --> 23:06.413
she needs your help.

23:08.379 --> 23:09.241
Hello?

23:10.448 --> 23:12.068
Hello?

23:12.103 --> 23:13.793
No, no, no way!

23:13.827 --> 23:15.724
No way we're getting into
something like that, Pokua.

23:15.758 --> 23:16.689
No!

23:16.724 --> 23:18.241
I told you she was crazy.

23:18.275 --> 23:19.275
Did you believe me?

23:19.310 --> 23:21.551
No, I am not.

23:21.586 --> 23:22.620
Come on guys.

23:22.655 --> 23:24.655
Okay, look at it this way,

23:24.689 --> 23:27.034
if we treat this as business,

23:27.068 --> 23:29.379
we are going to expose a
lot of cheating husbands

23:29.413 --> 23:30.586
and boyfriends.

23:30.620 --> 23:34.379
And if they pay for our
service, it's a lot of money.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.344
Think about it.

23:37.137 --> 23:38.517
Lots of money to make.

23:41.448 --> 23:44.241
Then what happens
to Pokbafell?

23:46.137 --> 23:49.551
The ushered business
is nothing to us.

23:49.586 --> 23:51.413
It makes us nothing.

23:51.448 --> 23:54.137
For how long?
We just keep trying.

23:54.172 --> 23:55.586
We need to try
something different.

23:55.620 --> 23:57.482
And getting into
people's private lives,

23:57.517 --> 23:59.551
that's your solution, Pokua?

23:59.586 --> 24:01.379
I mean, what kind
of job is that?

24:01.413 --> 24:03.068
What?

24:03.103 --> 24:05.068
Our work will be very simple.

24:05.103 --> 24:07.172
If you suspect your
partner is cheating on you,

24:07.206 --> 24:09.517
just tell us about it.

24:09.551 --> 24:11.689
We give you a proof, you pay us.

24:14.827 --> 24:15.827
Easy, huh?

24:15.862 --> 24:16.827
Easy, huh?

24:16.862 --> 24:18.482
It doesn't sound easy, huh?

24:18.517 --> 24:19.448
Not one bit, huh?

24:22.379 --> 24:23.551
You know what I think?

24:24.620 --> 24:27.172
I mean, she's crazy.

24:27.206 --> 24:28.068
She's insane-o

24:29.724 --> 24:30.586
but...

24:33.310 --> 24:34.413
I'm game.

24:34.448 --> 24:36.448
I mean, we don't
have a choice, right?

24:37.448 --> 24:38.793
Yeah, me too.

24:38.827 --> 24:41.172
I mean, if it's going to
make us money, let's do it.

24:41.206 --> 24:42.724
- Yeah!
- Brilliant!

24:42.758 --> 24:43.827
Going after the side chicks.

24:43.862 --> 24:45.034
- Yes!
- Mm-hmm.

24:45.068 --> 24:45.827
- Get the bad ones.
- Yeah.

24:45.862 --> 24:47.517
We're the good cops.

24:47.551 --> 24:48.758
It's so funny.

24:48.793 --> 24:52.689
Maybe we can name it
Side Chick Task Force?

24:52.724 --> 24:53.793
Huh?

24:53.827 --> 24:55.413
That don't sound...

24:55.448 --> 24:56.655
Why is there a police unit?

24:56.689 --> 24:58.172
- What else?
- Wait, wait.

24:58.206 --> 24:59.172
Let me think.

25:00.310 --> 25:03.551
Instead of task force,

25:03.586 --> 25:05.137
let's put gang.

25:05.172 --> 25:06.620
Yes!

25:06.655 --> 25:07.482
Gang!

25:07.517 --> 25:09.413
SideChic Gang!

25:09.448 --> 25:10.413
- Pa-pow!
- Poo-ooh!

25:10.448 --> 25:11.275
Pa-pow!

25:11.310 --> 25:12.551
SideChic Gang.

25:12.586 --> 25:14.034
Okay, good.

25:14.068 --> 25:14.827
SideChic Gang.

25:14.862 --> 25:15.689
Wait, let me help you.

25:15.724 --> 25:17.137
SideChic Gang.

25:17.172 --> 25:18.586
Draah! Draah!

25:18.620 --> 25:20.413
Skraah!

25:20.448 --> 25:21.517
Go, go.

25:21.551 --> 25:22.379
Is it...
Is it...

25:22.413 --> 25:23.413
Yes, it is.

25:23.448 --> 25:24.275
Okay.

25:24.310 --> 25:25.137
Okay.

25:25.172 --> 25:27.793
Now, office supplies.

25:27.827 --> 25:28.689
Yeah.

25:31.827 --> 25:32.689
Two cameras.

25:32.724 --> 25:33.793
Hmm, and a printer.

25:33.827 --> 25:36.310
Papers and stamps.

25:36.344 --> 25:39.793
Office table,
office chairs, TV?

25:39.827 --> 25:40.655
- TV.
- Yes.

25:40.689 --> 25:41.724
Office chair.

25:41.758 --> 25:42.827
And a fan.

25:42.862 --> 25:44.034
No, no, AC.

25:44.068 --> 25:44.724
But wait, wait, wait.

25:44.758 --> 25:46.551
Pokua, wait.

25:46.586 --> 25:49.379
I mean, I think we should
hold on on this list.

25:49.413 --> 25:50.413
Why?

25:50.448 --> 25:52.137
Get an office first.

25:56.758 --> 25:57.793
Too expensive.

26:20.862 --> 26:22.310
Guys, guys.

26:24.068 --> 26:24.758
Hurry up.

26:27.620 --> 26:28.482
For rent.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.068
Oh.

26:32.448 --> 26:37.448
03-02-123-231.

26:45.827 --> 26:47.068
Hello. Hi.

26:48.206 --> 26:50.034
We saw a structure
you're renting.

26:50.068 --> 26:51.000
We want it.

27:01.482 --> 27:02.344
Okay.

27:13.103 --> 27:15.655
What do you think
they do there?

27:15.689 --> 27:19.689
I think they find
young girls for old men.

27:19.724 --> 27:24.103
Eh?

27:51.172 --> 27:52.482
Hi, welcome.

27:52.517 --> 27:54.275
Thank you.

27:54.310 --> 27:56.137
How may I assist you?

27:57.413 --> 28:01.413
Well, I am told you
arrange young, sweet looking,

28:01.448 --> 28:03.448
beautiful girls for old men.

28:04.551 --> 28:06.068
Can you help me?

28:06.862 --> 28:08.172
And who told you that?

28:09.172 --> 28:10.551
My friend.

28:15.517 --> 28:19.103
I'm sorry,

28:19.137 --> 28:21.103
we don't offer
such services here.

28:21.137 --> 28:22.689
Oh.
So, what do you do?

28:22.724 --> 28:27.172
We help women catch
their cheating husbands.

28:28.172 --> 28:31.551
Yes, like the side chick police.

28:31.586 --> 28:35.793
Oh, sorry,
my friend lied to me.

28:35.827 --> 28:37.275
I apologize for that.

28:40.310 --> 28:44.103
But you see in case you
start my kind of service,

28:44.137 --> 28:45.000
remember me.

28:46.724 --> 28:50.827
You look great.
Yes.

28:50.862 --> 28:51.724
Goodbye.

28:51.758 --> 28:52.586
Bye-bye.

28:52.620 --> 28:53.448
Bye.

29:02.724 --> 29:03.586
Hi.

29:05.310 --> 29:06.137
Welcome.

29:07.689 --> 29:09.068
Hi, we spoke, yeah.

29:13.172 --> 29:14.137
I'm Vero's friend.

29:14.172 --> 29:15.241
You directed me here.

29:16.275 --> 29:17.206
Oh, yeah.

29:20.137 --> 29:21.620
Nice to have you.

29:21.655 --> 29:23.068
These are my colleagues.

29:26.862 --> 29:27.724
Hi.

29:29.448 --> 29:30.758
I'm told you can help me.

29:30.793 --> 29:31.655
Is that true?

29:32.827 --> 29:36.137
Well, it depends
on what you need.

29:36.172 --> 29:37.172
Please have a seat.

29:41.310 --> 29:42.172
Here.

29:49.379 --> 29:52.068
Talk to us.
How may we help you?

29:53.310 --> 29:56.586
I'm a career woman
married to a politician.

29:58.103 --> 30:02.275
He used to accuse me of not
having time for our marriage.

30:02.310 --> 30:04.758
I didn't want to lose him.

30:04.793 --> 30:07.758
So I changed jobs to
a less demanding one

30:07.793 --> 30:09.379
just to create time.

30:09.413 --> 30:13.379
But now I feel he's the one
who's denying me attention.

30:13.413 --> 30:15.379
He doesn't touch me anymore.

30:16.655 --> 30:18.689
Always acting tired.

30:18.724 --> 30:21.482
I refuse to believe that
he was cheating on me

30:21.517 --> 30:23.724
even when I found condoms hidden

30:23.758 --> 30:25.793
that's where his spare tire is,

30:25.827 --> 30:27.482
I blamed the mechanic.

30:29.344 --> 30:31.586
Last night
he didn't come home.

30:33.344 --> 30:35.551
I called him this morning.

30:35.586 --> 30:38.034
He said he went on
an impromptu trip.

30:38.068 --> 30:39.310
He'll be back tomorrow.

30:39.344 --> 30:42.275
His phone went off, that's why
he couldn't call to tell me.

30:43.448 --> 30:47.034
An hour later, a friend
called to tell me that

30:48.172 --> 30:50.689
she saw my husband's
car drive past her area.

30:52.689 --> 30:54.068
Shocking, huh?

30:55.862 --> 31:01.034
You know, I've been
crying since that moment.

31:02.241 --> 31:03.275
You need water?

31:03.310 --> 31:04.517
Fella, get her water.

31:04.551 --> 31:06.103
No.

31:06.137 --> 31:08.379
I'm fine.

31:08.413 --> 31:11.551
Now I'm convinced
he's cheating on me.

31:11.586 --> 31:12.551
I need help.

31:14.379 --> 31:15.793
Would you help me?

31:25.241 --> 31:28.206
- Do you have his pictures?
- Yeah.

31:28.241 --> 31:33.241
Yes.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.551
Here.

31:35.586 --> 31:39.344
Fill in all your details and
your husband's office address,

31:39.379 --> 31:40.241
okay?

31:57.275 --> 32:00.275
.

32:00.310 --> 32:01.310
It will cost you.

32:02.344 --> 32:04.000
How much are we talking about?

32:04.862 --> 32:06.413
I have 10,000 on offer.

32:11.827 --> 32:13.137
- Oh, oh.
- Okay.

32:13.172 --> 32:15.310
Oh, all right, I
mean, we can manage.

32:16.172 --> 32:17.034
Right.

32:23.206 --> 32:24.827
That's about
half of the money.

32:24.862 --> 32:27.241
When the job is
done, I pay the rest.

32:27.275 --> 32:28.551
Oh, fine.

32:29.551 --> 32:31.379
I count on you.

32:31.413 --> 32:32.379
Please help me.

32:33.482 --> 32:34.482
Don't worry.

32:34.517 --> 32:35.827
Thank you.

32:35.862 --> 32:37.655
So ladies, I'll show
you some of the best

32:37.689 --> 32:39.551
collections we have
here in this garage.

32:39.586 --> 32:41.310
You see this one,
this white car?

32:41.344 --> 32:43.068
It came in just last week

32:43.103 --> 32:45.724
and it is just
45K, just.

32:45.758 --> 32:48.586
And then this one, this
one, this black one,

32:48.620 --> 32:50.689
it arrived just yesterday.

32:50.724 --> 32:51.724
Yeah!
.

32:53.241 --> 32:55.793
And that one, I haven't
priced it yet, but 55,000.

32:55.827 --> 32:58.655
Or maybe 52, last.

32:58.689 --> 33:01.724
You ladies are very sleek and
when it comes to sleek ladies,

33:01.758 --> 33:03.586
you need something of a class.

33:04.586 --> 33:05.827
Thank you very much.

33:05.862 --> 33:07.827
You have beautiful cars.

33:07.862 --> 33:09.034
Ah, thank you,
thank you.

33:09.068 --> 33:10.724
But do you have any for rent?

33:12.758 --> 33:14.793
Hey...

33:16.172 --> 33:19.034
Madam, rent?

33:27.172 --> 33:28.482
Ren- Rent?

33:28.517 --> 33:31.586
Okay, so these collections
are from nineties,

33:31.620 --> 33:33.172
right up to 2005.

33:33.206 --> 33:34.655
So you can choose any you
want for that rent then.

You see, I'm dying slowly.

58:46.758 --> 58:47.758
You have to save me.

58:52.310 --> 58:53.172
Have a seat.

59:03.379 --> 59:04.310
Talk to us.

59:05.758 --> 59:07.241
I'm a mining engineer.

59:08.517 --> 59:10.241
I deal in gold and bauxite.

59:11.793 --> 59:15.413
I've been dating my
fiance for two years.

59:15.448 --> 59:17.310
We decided to marry next year.

59:19.344 --> 59:21.586
I have bought
everything for her,

59:21.620 --> 59:23.448
anything she's asked for.

59:23.482 --> 59:28.379
She uses two cars, has her
own house, supermarket,

59:28.413 --> 59:30.620
all from my account.

59:33.413 --> 59:37.551
See, I just thought she
would just focus on me.

59:38.862 --> 59:42.793
But no, she acts weird
and she's never satisfied.

59:44.379 --> 59:47.275
She never answers my
call on the first ring.

59:47.310 --> 59:50.241
And even when she
does, she whispers.

59:51.172 --> 59:52.310
Why would she do that?

59:53.827 --> 59:55.586
I suspect she's
seeing another man.

59:58.310 --> 1:00:00.206
You see, I don't care how
much money I've spent on her,

1:00:00.241 --> 1:00:02.172
on the man she's seeing,

1:00:02.206 --> 1:00:04.793
I just want to be
sure she's cheating.

1:00:07.724 --> 1:00:09.310
I wanna be free and walk away.

1:00:11.586 --> 1:00:14.724
Any amount you want, I'll pay.

1:00:20.551 --> 1:00:21.413
Okay.

1:00:25.655 --> 1:00:27.551
Do you have her picture?

1:00:27.586 --> 1:00:31.206
Sure, I took time out to
find out your requirements.

1:00:39.827 --> 1:00:43.172
.

1:00:43.206 --> 1:00:45.000
Please fill this for us.

1:01:05.448 --> 1:01:06.448
Here, there you go.

1:01:23.724 --> 1:01:25.068
I need an express job.

1:01:27.379 --> 1:01:32.379
Oh.

1:01:34.689 --> 1:01:36.172
Sure.

1:01:36.206 --> 1:01:37.758
Yes, we'll do that.

1:01:37.793 --> 1:01:38.724
Let me know if you need more.

1:01:38.758 --> 1:01:39.620
- Sure.
- Okay.

1:01:42.620 --> 1:01:43.551
Okay.

1:01:43.586 --> 1:01:44.413
Let me hear from you soon.

1:01:44.448 --> 1:01:46.275
- Oh, you will.
- Yeah.

1:01:47.551 --> 1:01:48.379
Wow!

1:02:07.103 --> 1:02:10.689
Wait, I thought
he bought her a car.

1:02:10.724 --> 1:02:11.827
She's smart.

1:02:11.862 --> 1:02:13.827
I wouldn't use my car too.

1:02:13.862 --> 1:02:15.586
No one want to be
caught cheating.

1:02:56.758 --> 1:02:58.206
She's coming!
She's coming!

1:02:58.241 --> 1:02:59.448
Keep calm, no panic.

1:02:59.482 --> 1:03:00.310
She's coming.

1:03:00.344 --> 1:03:01.172
What a nice house.

1:03:01.206 --> 1:03:03.034
Keep calm, no panic.

1:03:05.275 --> 1:03:06.137
Oh, hi.

1:03:07.137 --> 1:03:08.000
You need help?

1:03:10.448 --> 1:03:12.172
Why are you following me?

1:03:12.206 --> 1:03:14.413
Oh, who are you?

1:03:16.413 --> 1:03:17.275
Heh?
Hmm.

1:03:17.310 --> 1:03:18.275
What do you want?

1:03:19.620 --> 1:03:23.310
Look, I've heard about you
girls in the green ride.

1:03:25.448 --> 1:03:28.551
Girls in the green ride?

1:03:28.586 --> 1:03:29.655
There must be a mistake.

1:03:29.689 --> 1:03:30.517
Yeah.

1:03:30.551 --> 1:03:32.103
We are girls-

1:03:32.137 --> 1:03:33.758
- Girls on the road.
- Yeah.

1:03:33.793 --> 1:03:34.793
Girls on the road.

1:03:34.827 --> 1:03:35.724
Ooh, yeah.

1:03:36.724 --> 1:03:39.689
Girls on the road.

1:03:39.724 --> 1:03:41.172
Who's paying you to follow me?

1:03:41.206 --> 1:03:43.137
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:03:43.172 --> 1:03:45.482
I mean,
that's gone too far.

1:03:45.517 --> 1:03:47.413
I mean, what would
make you think that?

1:03:47.448 --> 1:03:49.827
So why did you
stop when I stopped?

1:03:49.862 --> 1:03:51.137
Slow down, sorry.

1:03:51.172 --> 1:03:52.551
Ooh, ooh, ou- ou-...
We s-

1:03:52.586 --> 1:03:54.413
Our engine broke down
a- and the car stopped

1:03:54.448 --> 1:03:55.448
a- and we stopped.

1:03:55.482 --> 1:03:56.655
Yes.

1:03:56.689 --> 1:03:58.689
You know, this is a
Lancia, so...

1:03:58.724 --> 1:04:01.448
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:04:07.620 --> 1:04:09.034
.

1:04:09.068 --> 1:04:09.758
Hmm.

1:04:30.724 --> 1:04:31.586
This is screwed!

1:04:31.620 --> 1:04:32.482
Damn!

1:04:33.724 --> 1:04:34.551
Damn.

1:04:34.586 --> 1:04:35.551
Damn it.

1:04:35.586 --> 1:04:36.586
We need spice.

1:04:36.620 --> 1:04:37.793
What for?

1:04:37.827 --> 1:04:39.068
For tip off.

1:04:39.103 --> 1:04:40.827
We can't be following
her like that,

1:04:40.862 --> 1:04:43.551
it will ruin everything.

1:04:43.586 --> 1:04:45.689
Pokua, that means more money.

1:04:45.724 --> 1:04:46.655
More money,

1:04:46.689 --> 1:04:48.275
where are we gonna get it from?

1:04:52.275 --> 1:04:54.689
I doubled the amounts
to speed up the process.

1:04:54.724 --> 1:04:56.827
I hope it pays off.

1:04:56.862 --> 1:04:58.689
Do you need some more
pictures for this?

1:04:58.724 --> 1:05:01.103
Oh, no, no, don't worry,
we just want copies of the

1:05:01.137 --> 1:05:02.413
old ones we have.

1:05:02.448 --> 1:05:03.379
Okay.

1:05:03.413 --> 1:05:04.275
Can I ask you a question?

1:05:04.310 --> 1:05:05.482
Sure.

1:05:05.517 --> 1:05:07.379
I mean, why wouldn't
she use one of the cars

1:05:07.413 --> 1:05:09.068
that you bought her?

1:05:09.103 --> 1:05:10.448
Excuse me?

1:05:10.482 --> 1:05:13.310
Yes, I mean, she hired a taxi.

1:05:13.344 --> 1:05:15.586
She's in to hiding, she
doesn't want me to find out.

1:05:15.620 --> 1:05:17.103
- Oh yeah, I figured.
- Oh.

1:05:17.137 --> 1:05:18.379
That's smart.

1:05:18.413 --> 1:05:19.655
You'll hear from us.

1:05:19.689 --> 1:05:20.517
I count on you.

1:05:20.551 --> 1:05:21.413
Yeah.

1:05:26.689 --> 1:05:28.689
We got spice at
the west and east.

1:05:28.724 --> 1:05:31.724
We're targeting hotels,
restaurants, and guest house.

1:05:33.241 --> 1:05:34.689
Please hold on. Mr. Sefa.

1:05:38.586 --> 1:05:39.448
Hello?

1:05:40.793 --> 1:05:41.655
Hello?

1:05:41.689 --> 1:05:42.724
Hello.

1:05:42.758 --> 1:05:44.413
I just saw your target.

1:05:44.448 --> 1:05:46.551
Just checked into our hotel.

1:05:46.586 --> 1:05:49.241
.

1:05:50.413 --> 1:05:52.275
Okay.
Thank you very much.

1:05:52.310 --> 1:05:53.172
Thank you.

1:05:54.068 --> 1:05:55.724
Can I call you back, Mr. Sefa?

1:05:57.448 --> 1:05:58.827
Thank you.

1:05:58.862 --> 1:06:01.172
Ladies, we have a tip off!

1:06:34.172 --> 1:06:34.827
Ooh!

1:06:34.862 --> 1:06:35.862
It's good you're here.

1:06:35.896 --> 1:06:38.206
I just went in there,
there in the bathroom

1:06:38.241 --> 1:06:40.206
and.

1:06:40.241 --> 1:06:41.137
Room one.

1:06:41.172 --> 1:06:43.034
- This has-
- Shh, shh, shh!

1:07:26.482 --> 1:07:27.310
Calm, honey.

1:07:27.344 --> 1:07:28.689
Honey, calm down.

1:07:28.724 --> 1:07:31.620
I- It's not what it looks
like, I can explain.

1:07:31.655 --> 1:07:32.551
Eh.

1:07:34.172 --> 1:07:35.172
I can explain.

1:07:35.206 --> 1:07:36.034
?

1:07:36.068 --> 1:07:36.758
What?

1:07:45.068 --> 1:07:46.448
Honey, listen, listen.

1:07:46.482 --> 1:07:47.413
Honey, listen.

1:07:47.448 --> 1:07:48.275
Calm down.

1:07:48.310 --> 1:07:49.310
Honey, wait.

1:07:51.551 --> 1:07:53.379
Wait, wait.

1:07:53.413 --> 1:07:54.551
Calm down.

1:07:54.586 --> 1:07:55.482
I can explain, it's
not what it looks like!

1:07:55.517 --> 1:07:57.206
Honey, wait, wait!

1:08:39.103 --> 1:08:40.103
Thank you.

1:08:41.517 --> 1:08:43.137
Ex- excuse me?

1:08:43.172 --> 1:08:44.689
Payment, please?

1:08:44.724 --> 1:08:46.206
Oh, that.

1:08:56.724 --> 1:09:01.724
Yeah, we're here.

1:09:02.862 --> 1:09:04.689
Yeah, someone will
handle your payment.

1:09:20.793 --> 1:09:23.103
Did you enjoy
seeing your husband

1:09:23.137 --> 1:09:24.103
with another woman?

1:09:28.448 --> 1:09:31.379
You are happy destroying
marriages for money.

1:09:31.413 --> 1:09:34.103
We helped you find
your cheating husband.

1:09:34.137 --> 1:09:35.758
You should pay us.

1:09:35.793 --> 1:09:37.137
Is that not what you do?

1:09:41.310 --> 1:09:45.448
You see, that lady
is not my fiance.

1:09:45.482 --> 1:09:46.344
I don't know her.

1:09:48.724 --> 1:09:50.241
But thanks for your service.

1:09:52.620 --> 1:09:54.241
I admire your speed.

1:09:55.137 --> 1:09:56.344
Have a good day.

1:10:03.793 --> 1:10:05.517
O- okay.

1:10:05.551 --> 1:10:06.551
Okay.
Hmm?

1:10:08.172 --> 1:10:09.655
- It's okay?
- You okay?

1:10:09.689 --> 1:10:11.310
Let's go back to.

1:10:12.206 --> 1:10:13.413
Let's go, let's go.

1:10:13.448 --> 1:10:14.551
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1:10:14.586 --> 1:10:19.586
No, I'm fine.

1:10:41.448 --> 1:10:42.482
Please, have a seat.

1:10:54.620 --> 1:10:56.241
So, talk to us.

1:10:58.586 --> 1:11:02.551
I
suspect my boyfriend

1:11:02.586 --> 1:11:04.068
is cheating on me.

1:11:04.103 --> 1:11:06.344
My friends say he
hangs out with a woman,

1:11:06.379 --> 1:11:08.689
which obviously isn't me.

1:11:08.724 --> 1:11:11.827
I can't remember the last
time we went out together.

1:11:11.862 --> 1:11:13.724
It's been over a year.

1:11:13.758 --> 1:11:15.137
Wow.

1:11:15.172 --> 1:11:16.034
Mm-hmm.

1:11:18.103 --> 1:11:19.482
I will need you to help me.

1:11:22.379 --> 1:11:26.517
I want to know if he's
seeing someone else.

1:11:26.551 --> 1:11:30.310
Okay.

1:11:42.275 --> 1:11:43.137
Are you okay?

1:11:49.862 --> 1:11:50.724
Um...

1:11:55.448 --> 1:11:57.413
Is- is- is this
your- your boyfriend?

1:11:58.379 --> 1:11:59.172
Yes.

1:12:00.344 --> 1:12:03.172
How long have
you been together?

1:12:05.310 --> 1:12:06.586
Three years.

1:12:06.620 --> 1:12:07.551
Any problem?

1:12:10.310 --> 1:12:12.275
Um, no.
No problem.

1:12:12.310 --> 1:12:15.344
This is just the regular
background check.

1:12:16.827 --> 1:12:17.827
Oh.

1:12:17.862 --> 1:12:19.689
So are you gonna help me?

1:12:19.724 --> 1:12:21.103
- Yeah, sure.
- Hmm.

1:12:21.862 --> 1:12:23.068
We'll help you.

1:12:23.103 --> 1:12:24.275
Splendid.

1:12:24.310 --> 1:12:27.241
So I will await your feedback.

1:12:35.068 --> 1:12:35.724
Baaba?

1:12:35.758 --> 1:12:37.310
Hmm?

1:12:37.344 --> 1:12:40.068
Hey, Baaba, there must be
some explanation to this.

1:12:40.103 --> 1:12:42.275
No, it's hot.

1:12:42.310 --> 1:12:43.344
- Baaba?
- Hmm?

1:12:45.275 --> 1:12:46.620
Oh, wow.

1:12:46.655 --> 1:12:48.034
Babe, are you okay?

1:12:48.068 --> 1:12:50.068
No, I'm fine.

1:12:50.103 --> 1:12:51.413
Are you sure?

1:12:51.448 --> 1:12:53.724
No, I'm very fine.

1:17:23.172 --> 1:17:25.689
I know how angry you are.

1:17:25.724 --> 1:17:26.586
I messed up.

1:17:28.103 --> 1:17:29.586
No excuse can restore you.

1:17:31.482 --> 1:17:32.344
I'm so sorry.

1:17:39.758 --> 1:17:43.758
I just needed you a little
more, but you were always gone.

1:17:45.068 --> 1:17:47.793
I've been angry and I
even wanted to break up,

1:17:49.275 --> 1:17:53.689
but I changed my thoughts
'cause I don't want to lose you.

1:17:57.448 --> 1:18:00.689
A lot of things changed
when you started this

1:18:00.724 --> 1:18:02.448

1:18:04.241 --> 1:18:05.448
You leave home before I'm awake

1:18:05.482 --> 1:18:07.517
and you return when I'm asleep.

1:18:07.551 --> 1:18:11.137
I mean, it was just crazy
spending all those nights alone.

1:18:11.172 --> 1:18:13.655
It almost felt like
I was single again.

1:18:13.689 --> 1:18:15.241
I was frustrated,

1:18:15.275 --> 1:18:17.310
I couldn't concentrate at work,

1:18:17.344 --> 1:18:20.206
so I started doing crazy stuff.

1:18:20.241 --> 1:18:22.379
Howcome we never
spoke about this?

1:18:25.344 --> 1:18:29.068
I didn't know how
you would take it.

1:18:29.103 --> 1:18:33.172
My friends told me that's
how to calm myself down and

1:18:34.068 --> 1:18:36.068
I listened to them.

1:18:36.103 --> 1:18:37.310
I am so sorry.

1:18:40.689 --> 1:18:42.034

more time with me, please.

1:18:51.620 --> 1:18:53.310
I don't want this to end.

You are so obsessed
with yourself,

1:22:42.068 --> 1:22:44.172
your work and the numerous
business meetings.

1:22:44.206 --> 1:22:45.551
Maybe you should
start dating them.

1:22:45.586 --> 1:22:46.758
Mm-hmm.

1:22:46.793 --> 1:22:48.413
They'll be better
girlfriends than me.

1:22:48.448 --> 1:22:49.310
I'm sorry!

1:22:51.448 --> 1:22:54.413
So, so this is what
I deserve, right?

1:22:59.655 --> 1:23:01.275
I have an idea.

1:23:01.310 --> 1:23:04.068
Girls, it took too
much courage for us

1:23:04.103 --> 1:23:05.758
to set up SideChic Gang.

1:23:05.793 --> 1:23:08.275
We can't just let it
die just like that.

1:23:08.310 --> 1:23:11.241
There must be something
that we can do different.

1:23:11.275 --> 1:23:16.275
So, I was thinking that
instead of using SideChic Gang

1:23:16.862 --> 1:23:18.448
to fight side chicks,

1:23:18.482 --> 1:23:21.517
maybe we should use it to
counsel couples, you know,

1:23:21.551 --> 1:23:24.034
to help them prevent it.

1:23:27.413 --> 1:23:28.586
Look, I know we've had our
own share of harsh lessons,

1:23:32.551 --> 1:23:34.586
but let's use our experiences.

1:23:34.620 --> 1:23:37.413
Let's use it to tell
these couples what to do

1:23:37.448 --> 1:23:39.206
to keep their partners,

1:23:39.241 --> 1:23:43.172
save their relationships,
their marriages, their homes,

1:23:43.206 --> 1:23:47.137
and the end result, there'll
be no more need for side chicks

1:23:47.172 --> 1:23:50.172
or side dudes or
anything like that.

1:23:52.068 --> 1:23:54.586
So, what do you think?

1:24:09.551 --> 1:24:12.034
Brilliant.

1:24:12.068 --> 1:24:13.241
Yeah.

1:24:13.275 --> 1:24:16.724
Come here.

1:24:16.758 --> 1:24:20.448
Oh!

1:24:20.482 --> 1:24:22.310
So, how may we help you?

1:24:23.689 --> 1:24:26.206
My husband has not been
the man I married lately.

1:24:26.241 --> 1:24:27.758
You know, so many
things changed.

1:24:29.137 --> 1:24:31.551
I think he doesn't find
me attractive anymore.

1:24:31.586 --> 1:24:34.517
I used to be the only thing
he ever dreamt of, but now,

1:24:34.551 --> 1:24:36.068
he's unbothered.

1:24:36.103 --> 1:24:38.241
I see why I don't exist.

1:24:38.275 --> 1:24:39.724
It hurts.

1:24:39.758 --> 1:24:40.758
Truly hurts.

1:24:41.965 --> 1:24:45.241
I feel he's finding another
woman beautiful somewhere.

1:24:46.586 --> 1:24:47.448
Please,

1:24:48.517 --> 1:24:49.724
I need you to help me.

1:24:51.206 --> 1:24:53.068
I want to know if there's
someone in his life.

1:24:54.586 --> 1:24:56.379
What were the things
you did together

1:24:56.413 --> 1:24:59.724
when you were the only
thing he needed in his life?

1:24:59.758 --> 1:25:01.758
We even went to watch movies,

1:25:01.793 --> 1:25:04.344
went on dinner
dates and shopping.

1:25:04.379 --> 1:25:05.758
Why did that stop?

1:25:05.793 --> 1:25:07.413
Well, personally, I
feel we were growing up

1:25:07.448 --> 1:25:10.448
and it was time to leave
some of such things,

1:25:10.482 --> 1:25:12.068
so I took a break.

1:25:12.103 --> 1:25:15.827
So when's the last time he
said something nice to you?

1:25:15.862 --> 1:25:16.827
Yesterday.

1:25:18.310 --> 1:25:19.551
Wait, wait, look.

1:25:19.586 --> 1:25:23.275
It's nice if he means
the nice things he says

1:25:23.310 --> 1:25:24.517
and that's the problem.

1:25:24.551 --> 1:25:29.137
And when was the last time
you said something nice to him?

1:25:29.172 --> 1:25:30.034
Hmm...

1:25:31.413 --> 1:25:33.068
I can't recall.

1:25:33.103 --> 1:25:34.620
I can't remember.

1:25:34.655 --> 1:25:35.655
Look, see,

1:25:36.793 --> 1:25:39.689
my husband is very
annoying, trust me.

1:25:39.724 --> 1:25:41.275
You wouldn't like him
when you meet him.

1:25:41.310 --> 1:25:44.241
Anytime I thought to say
something nice, he ruined it.

1:25:44.275 --> 1:25:45.793
What did he do?

1:25:48.172 --> 1:25:49.034
Uh...

1:25:50.172 --> 1:25:51.137
Are there that many?

1:25:51.172 --> 1:25:52.655
Oh, yeah.
A lot of them.

1:25:52.689 --> 1:25:54.344
I can't even remember.

1:25:54.379 --> 1:25:55.724
I can't even think of one.

1:25:55.758 --> 1:25:57.689
And have you
tried talking to him

1:25:57.724 --> 1:25:59.793
to find out what the problem is?

1:25:59.827 --> 1:26:01.551
I did not.

1:26:01.586 --> 1:26:03.413
I mean, I'm scared
it will upset him.

1:26:06.137 --> 1:26:08.241
Ma'am, it's hard
for us to tell you

1:26:08.275 --> 1:26:10.551
if your husband is
cheating or not.

1:26:10.586 --> 1:26:12.793
First, you stopped
doing the things

1:26:12.827 --> 1:26:15.137
that sparked up
your relationship,

1:26:15.172 --> 1:26:18.137
the dinner, the
movies, the shopping.

1:26:18.172 --> 1:26:19.517
It's a terror.

1:26:19.551 --> 1:26:23.206
All because you felt too
old for them.

1:26:23.241 --> 1:26:26.689
And he started seeing you
as an old, boring woman

1:26:26.724 --> 1:26:27.586
without spark.

1:26:30.103 --> 1:26:33.586
That aside, he still
compliments you, but you do not.

1:26:37.482 --> 1:26:40.034
I think you're creating
your own side chick.

1:26:40.068 --> 1:26:42.551
Get rid of her before she
takes away your marriage.

1:26:50.275 --> 1:26:51.137
Okay.

1:26:59.862 --> 1:27:01.103

1:27:02.827 --> 1:27:04.275
