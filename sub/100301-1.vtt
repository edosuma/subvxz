04:52.844 --> 04:54.112
What's your point?

05:02.988 --> 05:04.988

05:04.990 --> 05:07.123

05:07.125 --> 05:08.727
And...

05:11.096 --> 05:13.897
...we want our babies
born free.

05:13.899 --> 05:15.966
So we hired a lawyer

05:15.968 --> 05:17.401
- that made it clear that...

05:17.403 --> 05:20.003
EDWARD:
You hired a lawyer.

05:20.005 --> 05:22.138
Ben, what the hell
is this nigger talking about?

05:22.140 --> 05:24.174
Uh, well, sir, well,

05:24.176 --> 05:26.577
what we're talking about
is the last wishes

05:26.579 --> 05:29.279
of your great-granddaddy
Atthow Pattison.

05:29.281 --> 05:33.283
He gave my wife Rit
to your mama as a child,

05:33.285 --> 05:36.320
but she's supposed
to be freed at 45.

05:36.322 --> 05:38.356
She 57 now.

05:38.358 --> 05:40.358
Well, you got this will?

05:40.360 --> 05:43.193
Got a letter
from the lawyer, sir.

05:43.195 --> 05:46.430
- H-He say it clear.
- Hmm.

05:46.432 --> 05:48.298
HARRIET:
My mama was 46

05:48.300 --> 05:50.033
when you sold my sisters.

05:50.035 --> 05:52.102
Lawyer say that illegal.

05:52.104 --> 05:55.038
We all supposed to be free
when she turn 45.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.141
My sisters is lost to us,
but John and me... we...

05:58.143 --> 06:01.079
we want our babies born free
like they supposed to be.

06:05.150 --> 06:08.053
(continues ripping paper)

06:09.888 --> 06:12.456
Now you listen here, girl.

06:12.458 --> 06:16.293
Your daddy may be free
and your husband, too,

06:16.295 --> 06:20.364
but you and your mama

06:20.366 --> 06:21.965
and your brothers and sister...

06:21.967 --> 06:26.202
they belong to me... for life.

06:26.204 --> 06:28.472
And your babies will belong
to me

06:28.474 --> 06:32.343
and their babies
will belong to me.

06:32.345 --> 06:34.345
Do you understand me?

06:34.347 --> 06:36.279
RIT:
You're the devil!

06:36.281 --> 06:40.183
You're the devil,
Edward Brodess!

06:40.185 --> 06:42.185
You sold my daughters south

06:42.187 --> 06:44.388
where nobody know their name!

06:44.390 --> 06:46.657
- BEN: Come on now. Come on.
- (sobbing)

06:46.659 --> 06:47.725
- EDWARD: John.
- RIT: My babies.

06:47.727 --> 06:51.261
EDWARD: You and Ben ain't
welcome here no more.

06:51.263 --> 06:53.231
You stay away from my slaves.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.966
Now get the hell
off my damn porch.

06:56.968 --> 06:58.904

07:02.274 --> 07:04.174
(sighs)

07:04.176 --> 07:05.676
BEN:
Come on now.

07:05.678 --> 07:09.112
Come on.

07:09.114 --> 07:12.418
Weren't for you, I would have
sold that girl a long time ago.

07:19.991 --> 07:22.360
(crying)

07:22.362 --> 07:24.996
My master an evil man, Lord!

07:26.098 --> 07:28.033
You know he evil.

07:29.502 --> 07:32.302
If you can't change his soul,
take him!

07:32.304 --> 07:34.072
Take him, Lord!

07:35.140 --> 07:36.908
Strike my master down!

07:38.977 --> 07:41.379
Lord don't listen
to niggers, Minty.

07:41.381 --> 07:44.417
Now, I've been telling you that
since we were kids.

07:46.017 --> 07:48.284
Since the time
I had typhoid as a boy

07:48.286 --> 07:50.987
and Mama had you sittin' me.

07:50.989 --> 07:53.357
The first thing I saw
when I opened my eyes

07:53.359 --> 07:57.160
was your little black face
praying.

07:57.162 --> 07:59.264
Scared the fever
right out of me.

08:02.435 --> 08:05.569
Now, I got used to your face...

08:05.571 --> 08:08.204
but that praying...

08:08.206 --> 08:10.308
always made my skin crawl.

08:14.447 --> 08:17.147
What the hell were you
thinking, hiring a lawyer?

08:17.149 --> 08:19.417
(sighs)

08:19.419 --> 08:22.252
You think Daddy would just
let you all go free...

08:22.254 --> 08:26.024
damn near half his property...
just like that?

08:29.495 --> 08:31.163
He warned me.

08:33.097 --> 08:37.534
"Boy, having a favorite slave
is like having a favorite pig.

08:37.537 --> 08:40.169
"You can feed it,

08:40.172 --> 08:43.072
you can play with it,
give it a name..."

08:43.073 --> 08:44.073
(grunts)

08:44.075 --> 08:45.210
(groans softly)

08:48.448 --> 08:51.214
"One day...

08:51.216 --> 08:54.385
"you might have
to eat it or sell it.

08:54.387 --> 08:59.122
"You know it
and the pig knows it.

08:59.124 --> 09:01.224
"And if you have to sell it,
there's no more guilt

09:01.226 --> 09:04.495
"than separating piglets.

09:04.497 --> 09:07.533
And if you have to eat it,
you'll forget its name."

09:10.235 --> 09:12.170
I hope one day I forget yours.

09:15.641 --> 09:17.577
Come on home.

09:21.246 --> 09:23.215

We can sell the Ross brothers.

48:38.065 --> 48:41.333

is worth $600 or $700.

we can bring home maybe $1,600.

You missed her.

01:26:28.502 --> 01:26:30.468

GIDEON:
Tell us where she is.

01:26:32.306 --> 01:26:35.407
MARIE: I told you,
God's got plans for her.

01:26:35.409 --> 01:26:37.409
- GIDEON: What plans are those?
- MARIE: Wouldn't you like

01:26:37.411 --> 01:26:38.410

01:26:38.412 --> 01:26:40.612
(grunts)

01:26:40.614 --> 01:26:43.214
But she's...

01:26:43.216 --> 01:26:46.484
she's got to live long enough
to do God's will.

01:26:46.486 --> 01:26:48.153
She knows that.

01:26:48.155 --> 01:26:50.221
She's smarter than you.

01:26:50.223 --> 01:26:53.224
She's smarter than you.
She's smarter than you!

01:26:53.226 --> 01:26:54.392
Let me go!

01:26:54.394 --> 01:26:57.230

You...

01:26:58.465 --> 01:27:01.199

An unimaginable distance.

01:31:32.639 --> 01:31:34.907
Slave catchers are monitoring
all northbound travel.

God help the man

01:31:37.544 --> 01:31:39.644

01:31:39.646 --> 01:31:41.213
from the southern farms
and plantations

01:31:41.215 --> 01:31:43.015
all the way to the border
of Canada?

01:31:43.017 --> 01:31:46.218
We can't keep trying to outrun
them; we have to fight.

01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:47.887
The only way to make
the Fugitive Slave Law

01:31:47.889 --> 01:31:48.988
a dead letter

01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:51.589
is to make half a dozen

01:31:51.591 --> 01:31:53.225
That will cool their ardor.

01:31:53.227 --> 01:31:55.794

01:31:55.796 --> 01:31:57.631
Civil war might be

We can't just give up
a-and wait for war.

01:32:03.804 --> 01:32:05.237
We need to get back to work

01:32:05.239 --> 01:32:06.872
bringing slaves to freedom,

01:32:06.874 --> 01:32:10.575

horseback,

01:32:10.577 --> 01:32:11.676

01:32:11.678 --> 01:32:14.612
Harriet...

01:32:14.614 --> 01:32:16.248
the journey from Maryland
to Canada

01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:19.018
is 600 miles
from the Canadian border.

01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:20.718
Your longest trip
was a hundred.

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:23.688
Now, that would take months,
not weeks. You can't...

01:32:23.690 --> 01:32:25.824
I ain't giving up
rescuing slaves

01:32:25.826 --> 01:32:28.561
because it's far.

01:32:30.630 --> 01:32:33.767
Many of you don't know
slavery firsthand.

01:32:35.102 --> 01:32:37.602
You were born free.

01:32:37.604 --> 01:32:40.638

01:32:53.888 --> 01:32:55.923

01:32:58.591 --> 01:33:00.793
Children beat for not working,

01:33:00.795 --> 01:33:03.896
fore they understand
what work is.

01:33:03.898 --> 01:33:06.298

they first blood.

01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.968

till they back in ribbons.

01:33:08.970 --> 01:33:11.804

01:33:11.806 --> 01:33:15.573
Trying not to think
of what they went through.

01:33:15.575 --> 01:33:18.710
Those still enslaved
are going through right now.

01:33:18.712 --> 01:33:19.878
But I...

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:23.782

and they sighs.

01:33:23.784 --> 01:33:25.616
I've seen they tears.

01:33:25.618 --> 01:33:28.686
And I would give every last
drop of blood in my veins

01:33:28.688 --> 01:33:29.955

Hurry. Then meet me
at Brodess Farm.

01:38:31.191 --> 01:38:33.027
Yes, boss.

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.336
(labored breathing)

01:38:46.173 --> 01:38:48.874
No more. I don't want it.

01:38:48.876 --> 01:38:50.475
It's for your nerves, Mama.

01:38:50.477 --> 01:38:53.211
I don't want it!

01:38:53.213 --> 01:38:56.915
That girl is trying
to poison me.

01:38:56.917 --> 01:38:59.253
She blames me for her mother.

01:39:00.321 --> 01:39:02.421
Mama, you're just anxious.

01:39:02.423 --> 01:39:05.326
I am suffocating in this place.

01:39:06.994 --> 01:39:09.161
It's like being in prison,

01:39:09.163 --> 01:39:11.963

01:39:32.119 --> 01:39:35.354
Seeing as it's been discovered
that Moses is

01:39:35.356 --> 01:39:38.390

01:39:38.392 --> 01:39:40.258

01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.494

We're going through hard times,
like the rest of you.

01:40:03.283 --> 01:40:05.450

Girl, go get us some more
brandy from the storeroom.

I got a better idea.

01:40:25.005 --> 01:40:26.171

Our crops are meager,
our fortune all but gone.

01:40:39.086 --> 01:40:43.157

And I have a plan.

01:41:12.152 --> 01:41:15.086

01:51:29.970 --> 01:51:31.970
Ever since your daddy
sold my sisters,

01:51:31.972 --> 01:51:34.873
I prayed for God to make me
strong enough to fight.

01:51:34.875 --> 01:51:37.943
And that's what I prayed for
ever since.

01:51:37.945 --> 01:51:42.848
I reasoned that there was one
or two things I had a right to.

01:51:42.850 --> 01:51:45.152
Liberty or death.

01:51:46.954 --> 01:51:50.989

I'd have the other.

01:52:02.436 --> 01:52:04.735
And even if I'm not there
to watch it,

01:52:04.737 --> 01:52:07.772
I can almost smell it now.

01:52:07.774 --> 01:52:10.044
