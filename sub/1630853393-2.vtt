00:06.965 --> 00:08.550
Mr. Haller, I presume.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.510
<i>The Lincoln Lawyer,</i>
<i>that what they call you?</i>

00:10.593 --> 00:13.138
<i>You haven't had</i>
<i>any cases in quite some time.</i>

00:13.221 --> 00:15.223
<i>I was in an accident.</i>

00:15.932 --> 00:19.728
There were complications.
I took painkillers. Got addicted to 'em.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.939
-Hey.
-You got Hayley tonight.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.400
<i>-Just calling to remind.</i>
-<i>Hey, Mags.</i>

00:25.483 --> 00:27.318
If you're gonna treat me like shit,

00:27.402 --> 00:30.196
have the decency
to not look so amazing while doing it.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.157
Uh-uh.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.409
<i>What's your relationship</i>
<i>with Jerry Vincent?</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:37.912
He was murdered last night.
He left you his practice.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.081
<i>Including the Trevor Elliott trial.</i>

00:40.165 --> 00:42.584
<i>The tech guy</i>
<i>who killed his wife, her boyfriend.</i>

00:42.667 --> 00:43.501
<i>Allegedly.</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:46.504
Before I consider you,
I need to know you'd be ready next week,

00:46.588 --> 00:48.089
because I am not pushing this.

00:48.173 --> 00:51.009
Not for another week.
Not for another fucking day.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.303
<i>Do they know anything? Any suspects?</i>

00:53.386 --> 00:55.054
<i>Not to my knowledge, no.</i>

00:55.138 --> 00:58.391
Mickey's not really serious
about trying this case next week, is he?

00:58.475 --> 01:00.310
Cases like this
don't come around very often.

01:00.393 --> 01:04.105
Someone targeted Jerry Vincent.
You're at risk, Counselor.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.315
You could be next.

01:05.398 --> 01:08.610
I don't know how to thank you.
I will pay you one day, I promise.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.028
Uh, you pay me now.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.780
I'm broke.
Don't have a nickel to my name.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.031
Have a driver's license?

01:13.114 --> 01:15.825
-Is something wrong?
-We're being followed.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.840
We're being followed.
Black SUV, a couple cars back.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.801
-No front license plate.
-You sure?

01:32.884 --> 01:35.595
Not positive,
but they pulled out right after us.

01:35.678 --> 01:37.263
They've been on us ever since.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.018
-Want me to try and lose 'em?
-That an option?

01:42.101 --> 01:44.521
Works in <i>Grand Theft Auto.</i>

01:58.118 --> 01:59.327
Hang on.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.553
Not bad, huh?

02:33.736 --> 02:38.908
You missed all the news trucks out front.
But CNN called, the <i>LA Times</i> called.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.828
-You are gonna need a publicist.
-No time for interviews.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.706
Izzy, meet Cisco, my investigator.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.333
This is Lorna,
she pretty much runs the place.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.210
You put together that list?

02:49.294 --> 02:53.089
-Threats from Jerry's files?
-Yeah. It's on your desk.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.218
Are we bringing the dog every day?

02:57.302 --> 02:59.929
He's still getting used to me
working away from home.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.139
Aren't you, Winston?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.475
Whatever.
You want to hang out here for a while?

03:04.559 --> 03:07.145
No. I'll grab a coffee downstairs.
Call me when you need me?

03:07.228 --> 03:09.647
-Sounds good.
-Nice to meet you both.

03:09.731 --> 03:10.648
You too, Izzy.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.649
Mmm-hmm.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.238
-What's eating you?
-You've known this girl for ten minutes.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.949
I get gut feelings
about people, you know this.

03:20.033 --> 03:24.287
Now come on, let's start on Elliott.
All I've seen is the prosecution's case.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.456
What do we have in the defense file?

03:26.539 --> 03:28.166
Honestly? Not much.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.753
A couple of statements,
a witness list which you already have.

03:31.836 --> 03:32.754
That's about it.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.006
You mean to tell me
Jerry was going to trial

03:35.089 --> 03:38.217
on the biggest case of his life,
and had no defense at all?

03:38.301 --> 03:41.012
Well, if he had one,
it's not in that file.

03:41.095 --> 03:44.432
Whoever killed him stole his laptop.
So, maybe it was on there.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.435
-Didn't he back that up?
-Not here nor in the cloud.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.728
What about at his house?

03:48.811 --> 03:52.273
My source at the LAPD said
they didn't find anything there, either.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.401
The judge called for a status conference
the day after tomorrow.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.529
This could be the perfect opportunity
to ask for a continuance.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.699
-I can't do that. Elliott says--
-It's a deal-breaker.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.661
But going to trial with nothing
ought to be a deal-breaker, too.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.539
I'll figure something out.
You need me, I'm back here.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.417
And there is just one other little thing.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.711
-What? Something else?
-One of Jerry's cases.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.172
I've been trying
to piece together his calendar,

04:16.256 --> 04:19.217
which is a disaster,
terrible, I can't figure it out--

04:19.300 --> 04:20.718
-What is it, Lorna?
-Okay.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.763
You're due back in court. In…

04:25.640 --> 04:26.641
41 minutes.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.144
-In Inglewood.
-Inglewood?

04:30.228 --> 04:31.980
But on the bright side…

04:33.898 --> 04:35.525
at least there's a file.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.823
I'm seriously beginning to regret this.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.827
Don't worry. He thrives on this.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.336
You're going
with a grand jury instead of prelim.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.755
I wanna keep this
under wraps as long as I can.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.883
That way Soto won't see us coming,
my witnesses don't get rattled.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.845
-Just make sure you don't lose any.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.973
Tie this up with a bow, Maggie.
Ryan. What'd they say?

05:07.849 --> 05:08.683
Uh-huh.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.643
What?

05:11.602 --> 05:14.480
No, this is my biggest fundraiser.
We need that room.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.495
You like jazz?

05:30.580 --> 05:32.290
Yeah, sometimes. Helps me think.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.542
My father used to like it.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.755
He was a defense lawyer too, right?

05:38.838 --> 05:42.008
I looked you up. Had to know
what I was getting myself into.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.393
Man, I can see
why you need a car and a driver,

05:52.477 --> 05:54.062
going to different courthouses.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.646
-Izzy.
-Sorry.

05:59.984 --> 06:03.738
Let me ask you something.
What'd you think of Jerry?

06:03.821 --> 06:05.948
As a lawyer, I mean. Was he a good lawyer?

06:06.574 --> 06:07.492
Uh…

06:07.575 --> 06:11.412
I guess so. I mean, I'm no expert,
but he seemed pretty good to me.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.290
Yeah. That's what I thought, too.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.710
A pretty good lawyer
wouldn't go to trial with nothing.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.924
-Hey.
-Hey, yourself.

06:23.758 --> 06:24.884
Congratulations.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.804
Hear you got the Elliott case.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.974
-I guess news travels fast.
-Especially around here.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.811
I didn't ask for this, Mags.
Judge Holder gave it to me.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.855
Well, she gave you the opportunity.
But I bet

06:37.939 --> 06:41.734
it was that patented Mickey Haller charm
that got Elliott to sign off.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.444
Use what you got, right?

06:43.528 --> 06:45.613
-How's Hayley doing?
-<i>She's fine.</i>

06:45.696 --> 06:48.825
<i>She got a bit freaked out</i>
<i>when the cop showed up at your house.</i>

06:48.908 --> 06:51.536
Oh, yeah. Griggs. He's a piece of work.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.664
Hey, can I ask you something?

06:54.747 --> 06:57.750
This prosecutor, Golantz,
I don't know him.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.378
<i>That's what happens</i>
<i>when you're out for a year.</i>

07:00.461 --> 07:03.089
-Mickey, don't.
<i>-I'm not asking for trade secrets.</i>

07:03.172 --> 07:05.383
It's just, you know, what am I up against?

07:06.300 --> 07:09.804
It's a high-profile murder.
Who do you think they're gonna put on it?

07:09.887 --> 07:12.932
-<i>Okay, so he's good.</i>
-Try undefeated.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.767
It's why they moved him
up to Major Crimes.

07:14.851 --> 07:18.187
Well, you know I love
an undefeated prosecutor. They're cocky.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.814
Trips them up every time.

07:19.897 --> 07:23.192
Yeah, he's cocky.
He's also prepared. You should be, too.

07:24.026 --> 07:27.655
-I gotta go, okay? Good luck.
-All right.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.082
Coleman?
Which one of you is Terrell Coleman?

07:40.918 --> 07:42.211
I'm Coleman. Who're you?

07:43.087 --> 07:45.173
My name is Mickey Haller.
I'm your lawyer.

07:45.256 --> 07:49.844
I'm sorry to say this, but Jerry Vincent,
he… well, he passed away.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.930
Yeah, I saw on TV. Got himself shot.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.224
So, what? Now I got you?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.684
If you want me.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.395
-But I already paid Jerry.
-Then you already paid me.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.482
Hey, man. You a lawyer?

08:02.565 --> 08:05.401
I am, and I'm busy
with a client right now. You mind?

08:07.069 --> 08:08.154
Sorry about that.

08:08.237 --> 08:11.824
So, they charged you
with battery on a peace officer.

08:11.908 --> 08:12.783
Maurice?

08:13.534 --> 08:16.412
-I didn't lay a finger on that fool.
-I'm sorry. Maurice?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.705
Officer Grainger.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.582
-You know him?
-Of course.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.417
We went to high school together.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.045
Never forgave me
for stealing his girlfriend in 10th grade.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.213
Wait, hold on.

08:26.047 --> 08:30.051
The file says you got shut down selling
bootlegged T-shirts outside the USC game.

08:30.134 --> 08:33.137
-Half the city there selling shit.
-And you didn't push him?

08:33.221 --> 08:35.890
-Do I look like an idiot to you?
-No, you do not.

08:35.973 --> 08:39.060
Then why the fuck
would I push a cop? Shit, he pushed me.

08:39.810 --> 08:41.646
-Why did he?
-What do you mean?

08:41.729 --> 08:42.939
Why'd he push you?

08:44.398 --> 08:46.484
I might have said something about Chanel.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.570
-Who's Chanel?
-The girlfriend, man. Keep up.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.155
What'd you say your name was?

08:52.865 --> 08:56.118
-It's Haller. Mickey Haller.
-Okay, Mickey Haller. It's like this.

08:56.994 --> 08:59.872
Maurice hates me. And he's also a cop.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.501
So that's just my cross to bear,
as my grandma used to say.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.128
And you agreed
to a plea of a year. Correct?

09:06.212 --> 09:08.422
Jerry said
if I didn't take it, I'd do three.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.467
Man, I got a daughter.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.220
I've been in here too long already.

09:15.012 --> 09:18.683
-How old's your daughter?
-Eleven. Almost 12.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.602
She lives with her mother half the time.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.605
Well… all the time now.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.401
Jerry said if I plead,
they'll knock off what I served?

09:35.992 --> 09:36.826
Huh.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.788
Haller. You're up next.

09:42.957 --> 09:46.294
Sit tight. I'm gonna ask for
a continuance, buy us a day. Okay?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.754
-For what?
-Have faith, Terrell.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.929
I need you to call Trevor's office
and set up a meeting.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.849
<i>If I can't find anything in the file,</i>
<i>he may tell me something.</i>

09:59.932 --> 10:03.603
And before I forget, tell Cisco
I'm gonna need something for the new case.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.355
Terrell Coleman. I'll explain later.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.816
Tell him yourself,
we'll be here all night.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.444
Jerry's books are an even
bigger mess than his calendar.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.487
And I'll need access to his accounts.

10:13.571 --> 10:17.199
<i>Send an order to Judge Holder's</i>
<i>clerk. I'll get her to sign it.</i>

10:17.283 --> 10:20.077
Listen, Lorna.
I know you're just being protective,

10:20.161 --> 10:22.079
<i>but maybe lighten up about Izzy.</i>

10:22.163 --> 10:24.415
Protective? Is that what you think?

10:24.498 --> 10:28.502
She parked her car in the garage
this morning and asked me if we validated.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.379
Millennials. They're the worst.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.464
All right.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.078
Hey!

11:14.423 --> 11:16.550
<i>But are you sure</i>
<i>it's the same SUV?</i>

11:16.634 --> 11:19.470
If I were sure,
I'd be a hell of a lot more freaked out.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.389
I'll look into it.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.642
But if there's no plate number,
there's not much I can do.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.478
No. I need you to focus on Trevor Elliott.

11:27.561 --> 11:31.649
That reminds me. Last night,
when Lorna was going over Jerry's books,

11:31.732 --> 11:34.527
she found a bunch of payments
to an investigator.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.113
-Anybody we know?
-I don't think so.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.324
Bruce Carlin. Ex-LAPD.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.993
I'm gonna pay him a visit,
see if he knows anything.

11:43.077 --> 11:46.163
All right. After that I need you
to look into something else.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.624
The boyfriend. Jan Rilz.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.753
-The yoga instructor?
-Yeah. The cops got tunnel vision.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.548
They zeroed in on Elliott,
he was the obvious suspect.

11:55.631 --> 11:58.801
-But there was a second victim.
-You're thinking Rilz was the target?

11:58.884 --> 12:00.219
Instead of Elliott's wife?

12:00.302 --> 12:03.514
I'm thinking I need something
to defend my client with, Cisco.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.726
I have the order you requested.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.896
This will grant you access
to Mr. Vincent's business accounts.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.148
Thank you, Your Honor.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.984
It seems you've inherited
quite a thriving practice.

12:15.985 --> 12:20.072
Naturally, I expect you to be on top of
all of the cases, not just Trevor Elliott.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.282
Of course, Your Honor.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.910
-Was there something else?
-Just one thing, Your Honor.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.120
It's about the police.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.956
You were right about them
trying to get into Jerry's files.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.292
-I put a stop to that immediately.
-I should hope so.

12:31.375 --> 12:35.671
The thing is, the lead detective,
his name is Griggs, Raymond Griggs.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.214
Well, he made a good point.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.468
He said the evidence suggests
that Jerry's murder wasn't random.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.303
That could mean one of his clients.

12:42.386 --> 12:45.014
I can't give the police
access to Jerry's files.

12:45.097 --> 12:49.602
So, my investigator and I went
through them, looking for any red flags.

12:49.685 --> 12:50.811
Red flags?

12:50.895 --> 12:54.773
Clients who made threats
against Jerry, or angry family members.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.944
And you want
to give this list to the LAPD?

12:59.028 --> 13:01.655
That would still be
violating client confidentiality.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.200
Not necessarily, Judge.
There's an exception

13:04.283 --> 13:07.369
if a lawyer believes
there's an imminent threat to his life.

13:07.995 --> 13:12.291
Now, Detective Griggs thinks the identity
of Jerry's killer might be in his files.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.292
And, uh…

13:14.376 --> 13:18.422
Well, those are now my files.
So his threat is my threat.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.593
I took the liberty
of drafting another order.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.638
I don't like this.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.728
That said, I do appreciate your situation.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.776
But for your sake, Mr. Haller,

13:38.859 --> 13:42.279
I sincerely hope that Detective Griggs
is barking up the wrong tree.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.273
-Nice car.
-It's not for sale.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.986
I work for Mickey Haller.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.196
The guy took over Jerry Vincent's clients.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.407
It sounds about right.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.871
I never met Haller.
I remember his old man though.

14:32.621 --> 14:33.664
Does he pay well?

14:34.915 --> 14:35.916
Well enough.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.840
So, you want to know
about Jerry's cases, is that it?

14:42.923 --> 14:47.469
Mostly Trevor Elliott, he's the whale.
Were you working on that?

14:48.846 --> 14:52.474
Only at first.
Then Jerry pulled me off it.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.685
-Why?
-The hell if I know.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.146
Whatever he was
putting together for Elliott,

14:57.229 --> 14:59.148
he kept it quiet, even from me.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.234
So you have no idea
what he was planning as a defense?

15:02.318 --> 15:03.402
What'd I just say?

15:05.863 --> 15:07.114
Sorry. Just…

15:07.948 --> 15:10.409
Whole thing has me
a little rattled, you know?

15:11.368 --> 15:14.997
One minute
you work with the guy, the next minute…

15:18.042 --> 15:21.378
-So my boss has reason to be worried?
-I don't know.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.464
All I know is the last few weeks,

15:25.007 --> 15:26.759
Jerry was acting funny,

15:26.842 --> 15:30.346
like he was scared
of something or someone.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.473
Now he's gone.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.769
So you tell me
if there's something to be worried about.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.485
Knock, knock.
How's the trafficking case coming?

15:45.402 --> 15:46.528
Like pulling teeth.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.781
And Janelle's on the warpath.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.700
Six months until the election,
it's only gonna get worse.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.663
You need a break?
Want to go grab a coffee downstairs?

15:57.414 --> 16:00.751
-What?
-I'm just trying to figure out your game.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.589
Or do you expect me to believe
that you're asking me about my case?

16:06.674 --> 16:09.176
Okay, fine. Um…

16:10.302 --> 16:13.347
It's no secret that your ex-husband
took over the Elliott trial.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.516
I just don't want anything to be awkward.

16:15.599 --> 16:19.645
Why would it be awkward?
It was two dates, Jeff. No big deal.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.606
I see I left
my usual big impression. Good.

16:24.733 --> 16:29.655
Okay. I'm gonna tell you
what I told him. Which is he's good.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.324
Very good. So are you.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.952
So it's gonna come down
to who has the best case,

16:35.703 --> 16:37.496
you know, the way it's supposed to.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.750
Where's he been? Your ex, I mean.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.377
I looked him up and it doesn't seem

16:43.460 --> 16:46.130
like he's handled anything
for almost a year now.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.089
Nowhere.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.633
Just took some time off.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.802
I should get back to this.

16:52.761 --> 16:53.595
Of course.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.223
Maggie McFierce.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.714
Huh.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.132
What's "huh"?

17:30.841 --> 17:33.719
We got the access
to Jerry's business accounts. But look…

17:33.802 --> 17:37.181
Remember I told you he took
a $625,000 retainer from Elliott?

17:37.264 --> 17:38.265
Mmm-hmm.

17:38.348 --> 17:41.226
Well, there it is.
But then there's all these withdrawals.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.480
-It's almost gone.
-What the hell did he spend it on?

17:44.563 --> 17:49.318
Rent, overhead, whatever.
But most went into his personal accounts.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.402
Salary advance.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.696
-We don't have access to those?
-Nope.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.907
But he had an assistant, Wren Williams.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.910
Visiting her mom in Cleveland
for a week, she's coming in tomorrow.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.162
Um…

18:00.245 --> 18:02.998
There's one other thing
I've been meaning to bring up.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.584
-About Elliott?
-No. It's not about work.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.087
Well, it's kind of about work. But, um…

18:08.837 --> 18:10.172
About you and Cisco?

18:11.048 --> 18:13.133
-He told you?
-Well, can you blame him?

18:13.217 --> 18:15.427
He didn't think
you'd ever get around to it.

18:15.511 --> 18:19.181
There's just been so much going on,
I didn't want to make things weird.

18:19.264 --> 18:24.478
Lorna. Hold on. Look, there is a lot
going on right now. Okay?

18:24.561 --> 18:25.771
This isn't part of it.

18:27.022 --> 18:30.317
I just want to be sure you know
what you're getting yourself into.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.487
The guys Cisco used to ride with,
they're not a social club.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.115
-That was a long time ago.
-I know.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.952
I'm not saying he's not a great guy.
He is a great guy. The best.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.872
-Just not Mickey Haller or anything. But--
-Don't start.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.500
You know that's what
my mother's gonna say.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.670
Now I'm the one being overprotective.

18:50.754 --> 18:54.424
I'm happy for you, Lorna.
For both of you. I really am.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.180
-What?
-Forget it.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.099
You get anything useful from Carlin?

19:02.808 --> 19:06.186
-On Elliott? No. On Jerry…
-What about Jerry?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.814
Well, Carlin said he was acting scared.

19:08.897 --> 19:12.985
But one PI to another,
Carlin knew more than he was letting on.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.237
Good thing your pal, Griggs,
beat me to him.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.488
LAPD was there?

19:16.572 --> 19:17.489
Mmm.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.950
What about you? Anything?

19:20.659 --> 19:23.662
No. Look at this. It was in the file.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.789
Some freelance videographer,

19:25.873 --> 19:27.916
the types who surf
the police channel all night.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.418
Yeah, I saw it.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.880
I was hoping it might show some
discrepancy from the cops' account,

19:32.963 --> 19:36.550
but it's exactly the same.
Why was Jerry putting this into evidence?

19:36.633 --> 19:37.801
And this witness list,

19:38.552 --> 19:41.430
he's got every deputy
in the Malibu sheriff's station here.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.765
-He's playing hide-the-ball.
-Hide what ball?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.768
He's got
this ballistics expert, Dr. Arslanian.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.688
No, I talked to her.
Jerry never even sent her the file.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.273
-What?
-She won't testify

19:51.356 --> 19:54.484
or even write a report
until she knows what she's dealing with.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.153
And Jerry never sent it to her.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.405
Oh, my God. You gotta be kidding me.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.784
-You get me that appointment with Trevor?
-That's the other thing.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.579
His office said
he'll be tied up in meetings all day.

20:05.662 --> 20:06.747
His new game's coming out.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.916
He'll see you at the status conference.

20:08.999 --> 20:13.629
Tomorrow? Does this guy realize
he's on trial for murder in a week?

20:14.796 --> 20:16.173
Whatever. I gotta go.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.093
Mick.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.722
There's only so much
you can do for the guy.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.557
You can only work with what you got.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.727
-You get paid either way.
-No, Cisco.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.730
You know what the problem is
with a high-profile case?

20:32.356 --> 20:34.566
It's not about the money. You gotta win.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.862
Cochran, Shapiro, the "Dream Team"?
They aren't legends because they got OJ,

20:38.946 --> 20:41.740
they're legends
because they won. I lose this case,

20:41.823 --> 20:45.244
and I'm just a guy who got
a second chance and fell flat on his face.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.917
I'm telling you,
he thrives on this.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.721
Hey. Everything okay?

21:04.805 --> 21:07.099
Yeah, I'm just dealing
with this grand jury thing.

21:07.182 --> 21:10.018
Listen, I know this is really last minute.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.396
But can you pick Hayley up from school?

21:12.479 --> 21:15.107
<i>-The carpool flaked, and I'm stuck here.</i>
-Uh…

21:15.190 --> 21:17.567
-Yeah. At what time?
-<i>Three o'clock.</i>

21:17.651 --> 21:20.237
<i>If you can't, it's okay,</i>
<i>I'll figure something out.</i>

21:20.320 --> 21:23.156
I can do it.
I'll bring her by your place later.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.492
Great. Okay, thanks.

21:26.451 --> 21:31.331
Listen, I'm just going to say it.
You really must be in a bind.

21:32.374 --> 21:36.169
Either that or…
you're starting to trust me again.

21:36.253 --> 21:41.049
Three o'clock, Haller. I mean it. Bye.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.939
You asked, I answered.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.649
What's this?

21:58.233 --> 22:00.610
I can't give you access
to Vincent's files.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.487
So, I did the next best thing.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.866
We went through them and identified
every bona fide threat we could find.

22:05.949 --> 22:09.077
That isn't gonna work.
You don't know what you're looking for.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.872
Really? Because I figure,
as a defense lawyer,

22:11.955 --> 22:15.125
-I might spot some stuff even you'd miss.
-So you say.

22:15.208 --> 22:18.628
Yeah, so I say. Look, this is
the only thing the Judge would go for.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.130
Do you want the list or not?

22:22.632 --> 22:23.467
Fine.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.179
-I don't have time for bullshit.
-But first…

22:28.180 --> 22:32.225
So, Trevor Elliott, Jerry's biggest case
is now my biggest case.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.896
Only… Well, I'm having
a hard time finding a defense.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.773
Tough to save them when they're guilty.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.692
But your type
usually comes up with something.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.361
It would help me to know
what Jerry was working on.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.863
There's not much in the files,

22:44.946 --> 22:47.449
and you didn't find anything
at his house, either.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.243
-And how the hell do you know that?
-It doesn't matter.

22:50.327 --> 22:54.039
I wanna know what you know. I'm not
asking for anything confidential, just…

22:54.122 --> 22:58.835
For example, it would be standard
procedure to run the GPS on Jerry's car,

22:58.919 --> 23:00.587
see where he's been recently.

23:00.670 --> 23:04.382
Anywhere unusual that might point me
in a direction I wouldn't think of?

23:05.592 --> 23:07.427
You got some set of balls on you.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.387
I have been told, yes.

23:12.140 --> 23:16.812
All right. Fine. There was nothing
out of the ordinary on his GPS.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.231
Work and home, basically.
Except for one place.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.941
-A casino.
-A casino?

23:21.024 --> 23:24.194
Athena's Temple.
One of those poker places in South LA.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.904
Jerry like to gamble much?

23:27.155 --> 23:28.240
Not that I ever saw.

23:28.323 --> 23:31.076
He went to this place three times
in the last month.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.245
We checked it out,
but no link to the murder.

23:33.328 --> 23:38.583
Maybe as a defense lawyer, um,
you'd find something I'd miss.

23:39.417 --> 23:42.003
Or not. I really don't give a shit.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.131
Now if you don't mind.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.095
See you around, Counselor.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.986
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>
<i>I'm almost done here, I could swing by.</i>

24:06.069 --> 24:08.280
Trust me, honey.
This is so not your scene.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.532
-I'll call you if I get anything.
<i>-All right.</i>

24:10.615 --> 24:11.908
-Okay. Bye.
<i>-See you soon.</i>

24:11.992 --> 24:13.660
-Bye. See you next week.
-See ya.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.164
Hey! Great class.

24:17.247 --> 24:21.293
-I'm glad you enjoyed it.
-Your studio's over on Rose, right?

24:21.376 --> 24:22.586
That's us. Come check it out.

24:22.669 --> 24:26.590
Oh, is that a nose ring? That is so cool.
I thought about getting one of those.

24:27.716 --> 24:32.137
There was a guy that used to teach there.
Ugh, what's his name?

24:32.220 --> 24:34.472
Like Johann or something?

24:35.223 --> 24:37.225
Jan. Jan Rilz. Yeah.

24:37.851 --> 24:42.230
-But I'm afraid he, uh…
-Yeah. I heard about that. I'm sorry.

24:42.939 --> 24:43.773
Thank you.

24:47.194 --> 24:50.280
I'm not very good at this.
So, I'm just gonna be honest.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.908
I work for the lawyer
representing Trevor Elliott.

24:54.784 --> 24:55.702
Wow.

24:55.785 --> 24:58.330
-Seriously?
-I'm so sorry to show up like this.

24:58.413 --> 25:01.583
We're just doing our job
and that includes looking into everything.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.044
'Cause that other lawyer tried this too.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.838
Wait. Who? Jerry?

25:06.922 --> 25:09.925
Yeah. Jerry. I told him
to get the hell away from me.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.761
-And the same goes for you.
-You know he's dead, right?

25:12.844 --> 25:14.512
-Who?
-Jerry.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.723
He was shot in his garage
three nights ago.

25:16.806 --> 25:19.768
That's how we got the case.
I don't blame you for being mad.

25:19.851 --> 25:23.188
But there's something
really weird going on here,

25:23.271 --> 25:27.108
and if that's the case, don't you owe it
to Jan to get to the bottom of it?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.615
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>the boyfriend might be in play.</i>

25:34.241 --> 25:36.743
He owned some yoga place in Venice

25:36.826 --> 25:38.078
with some lady named…

25:38.161 --> 25:40.914
-Krisha.
-Krisha Gold, yeah.

25:41.706 --> 25:45.460
Lorna talked to her. She figured she might
fit in better than me at yoga.

25:45.543 --> 25:48.463
Aw, come on, Cisco.
Nobody does a tree pose like you.

25:49.130 --> 25:53.301
Yeah, well. Uh, she wasn't happy to talk.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.262
But Lorna worked her charm

25:55.345 --> 25:58.890
and this Krisha gave up
a bunch of Rilz' old stuff.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.977
-And?
-And it turns out Lara Elliott

26:02.060 --> 26:05.605
wasn't the only married woman
to whom Rilz was giving private lessons.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.148
Now we're getting somewhere.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.068
See, if there's one jealous husband,
there might be more.

26:10.151 --> 26:14.406
Maybe. But this Krisha said that Jerry
was sniffing around this, too.

26:14.489 --> 26:17.951
If he had found anything,
wouldn't he put it in the file?

26:18.034 --> 26:20.537
Not if he didn't want
the prosecutor to see it.

26:20.620 --> 26:24.040
Might not be ethical but I don't know
what Jerry was capable of.

26:24.124 --> 26:28.128
All right, I'll stay on it.
Did you get those photos I sent you?

26:28.211 --> 26:31.423
Uh, yeah. Yeah, they're perfect.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.341
All right, thanks.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.260
Listen, I gotta call you back, okay?

26:35.885 --> 26:37.137
How was your day, <i>mija?</i>

26:43.268 --> 26:45.145
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you say something?

26:45.228 --> 26:46.479
How was school?

26:46.563 --> 26:48.690
Oh, uh… it was good.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.360
That's great. Sorry for the mess.
I don't usually have guests.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.904
It's fine.
I mean this is your office, right?

26:54.988 --> 26:55.822
Yeah.

27:00.201 --> 27:04.164
-Shit. Don't… Please don't look at that.
-Dad, it's fine.

27:04.247 --> 27:08.293
I mean, you represent, like,
murderers and stuff. I get it.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.546
You should see what Mom
brings home from work.

27:11.629 --> 27:12.672
Like what?

27:13.465 --> 27:17.260
Doesn't matter.
It's just… I'm not a kid anymore.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.428
You know that, right?

27:19.429 --> 27:22.307
I know.
Doesn't mean I have to like it, though.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.477
Don't tell your mom I said "shit."

27:28.063 --> 27:31.483
-So, you're my dad's new driver?
-That's me.

27:31.566 --> 27:33.610
-What were you in for?
-Hayley.

27:33.693 --> 27:37.405
What? You always hire your clients
as driver. It's a valid question.

27:37.489 --> 27:41.117
I am happy to say, I've never had to
do hard time. Thanks to your father.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.661
-Sweet.
-How're we looking, Izzy?

27:44.496 --> 27:46.539
We'll need to go
to Inglewood first to be on time.

27:46.623 --> 27:47.707
Honey, I'm late for court.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.710
You mind if Izzy drops me off
and takes you to the office?

27:50.794 --> 27:54.881
-You can hang with Lorna until I get back.
-So, you have an actual office then?

27:54.964 --> 27:57.092
Uh, sort of. It's temporary, I think.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.887
I have a better idea.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.853
You, okay? You seem nervous.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.856
Of course.
I am nervous, not about the case,

28:11.940 --> 28:14.984
about my daughter watching me.
She's never done that before.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.614
-What?
-Nothing.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.785
It's nice.
You care what she thinks about you.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.287
Her mom is a prosecutor. It's complicated.

28:26.996 --> 28:30.542
A year ago, if this had happened,
I'd be popping pills like Tic Tacs.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.169
I hear that. Hey, can I ask you something?

28:33.253 --> 28:35.839
-What?
-Lorna, the one who doesn't trust me.

28:36.673 --> 28:37.966
She's your ex-wife, too?

28:39.551 --> 28:42.178
Yeah, that was a mistake
and we both knew it.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.264
I was just in the rebound from Maggie.

28:44.889 --> 28:47.142
And now Lorna
is marrying your investigator.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.562
Like I said, it's complicated.
It's not that she doesn't trust you.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.814
She does.
She worries about me. That's all.

28:53.857 --> 28:54.691
Hmm.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.111
-Ready?
-Yeah, come on.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.993
47922,
<i>the People vs. Terrell Coleman.</i>

29:08.747 --> 29:14.127
So, Mr. Haller, you had a chance to kick
the tires on Mr. Coleman's plea agreement.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.463
Are we ready to sign off on that today?

29:16.546 --> 29:18.631
There's not gonna be a plea, Your Honor.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.134
Mr. Coleman has decided
to go to trial after all.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.051
Your Honor.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.388
Mr. Haller, that is your client's right.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.891
But I will have to give
Mr. Choi time to prepare.

29:27.974 --> 29:31.019
I understand, Your Honor,
and he may need even more time,

29:31.102 --> 29:32.771
once we introduce some evidence here.

29:32.854 --> 29:35.857
There was no body camera
footage from Officer Grainger.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.485
Officer Grainger's body camera
was malfunctioning that day.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.570
Right, if Officer Grainger says so.

29:40.653 --> 29:43.198
Now, luckily there's an ATM with a camera

29:43.281 --> 29:45.950
across from where
this alleged altercation occurred.

29:46.576 --> 29:47.911
Is there a monitor we can use?

29:47.994 --> 29:51.748
Your Honor, the People welcome
any footage Mr. Haller wishes to present.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.917
-It will only serve--

29:56.586 --> 29:58.171
Mr. Choi?

29:58.254 --> 30:01.216
Your Honor, may I have a moment
to confer with Officer Grainger?

30:01.299 --> 30:04.677
Why, of course, Mr. Choi,
the court is made entirely of time.

30:09.432 --> 30:13.812
-What's happening?
-Liars getting caught in their lies.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.776
Okay, time served.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.986
Only if you drop down
to selling without a permit,

30:22.070 --> 30:23.738
expunge the whole thing
from his record.

30:26.074 --> 30:26.991
Fine.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.537
Good news, Your Honor. I believe
we've come to an agreement after all.

30:35.583 --> 30:39.045
Mickey Haller,
I'll never forget this, man.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.464
Anything you need, I'm there.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.092
Hopefully, I won't
have to take you up on that.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.009
You never know.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.221
There really was a camera
on the ATM down there?

30:48.304 --> 30:50.557
Of course.
We never lie to the court, Terrell.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.517
Now, what's on that camera?

30:53.518 --> 30:54.936
That I have no idea.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.980
So, what's on the flash drive?

30:57.063 --> 30:59.566
That's just some music
my dad used to like.

30:59.649 --> 31:02.193
You see her?
That's my daughter over there.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.154
Don't forget
to pick yours up on your way home.

31:08.157 --> 31:09.534
-Thank you.
-Take it easy.

31:09.617 --> 31:10.535
Peace.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.872
-Ready?
-Mmm-hmm.

31:18.334 --> 31:21.754
-We're home.
-Hey, Mags.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.299
Hey. Hey, you.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.467
-Homework?
-Already did it.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.012
Good. If you wanna
jump online that's cool.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.681
-Half an hour, okay? You got school.
-Okay.

31:32.348 --> 31:34.350
-Love you, honey.
-Bye, love you.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.481
Thanks again for helping out.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.400
Are you kidding me? Anytime.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.319
You don't have to hide the evidence.

31:44.402 --> 31:48.114
Just because I'm in recovery, doesn't mean
you can't have a glass of Cabernet.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.490
Okay.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.119
So, Hayley saw you in court today.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.624
Why? You wanted me to call you first?
You seemed kind of busy, Maggie.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.375
No, I'm just being a nervous mom.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.254
How's Trevor Elliott coming?

32:04.631 --> 32:05.632
It's good.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.679
You know, you never did tell me
who the lucky guy was.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.932
-What lucky guy?
-You know, the other night,

32:14.015 --> 32:16.976
when I picked up Hayley,
you looked all nice.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.186
I just assumed that…

32:19.687 --> 32:23.149
What? Am I not still allowed
to get a little jealous here?

32:24.192 --> 32:28.529
A, no, you're not. And B…

32:29.489 --> 32:31.991
like you're not out on Tinder or whatever.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.911
Tinder, eh?
Yeah, that's what you think I do?

32:35.954 --> 32:38.623
-You liked my profile, didn't you?
-Maybe.

32:39.832 --> 32:43.920
Mickey, it wasn't a date.
It was a, uh, parent-teacher conference.

32:45.088 --> 32:48.257
Aw, shit, Mags, come on.
You should have told me.

32:49.258 --> 32:51.678
-Could have gone together and--
-Mickey.

32:53.763 --> 32:56.557
Right, sure.
I get it, you're not ready for that yet.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.313
You know, I'm not the same person
I was a year ago, Maggie.

33:04.232 --> 33:05.274
I know that.

33:07.276 --> 33:10.029
I'm fully aware that Hayley
needs you in her life again.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.491
Believe me, I need you in her life.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.662
Can't we take it one step at a time?

33:19.789 --> 33:20.748
Yeah.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.450
<i>Tell me you got something.</i>

33:55.533 --> 33:58.077
Well, sorta.
I was printing Jerry's account ledgers

33:58.161 --> 34:00.788
when I realized you can access
the memory of the printer,

34:00.872 --> 34:02.540
find out the last thing Jerry printed.

34:02.623 --> 34:05.626
-Yes, good thinking, Lorna.
-Don't get all happy yet.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.045
<i>The day Jerry was killed,</i>

34:07.128 --> 34:09.672
he printed a motion
for continuance in the Elliott case.

34:09.756 --> 34:12.300
So, he was gonna ask
for a continuance after all.

34:12.383 --> 34:13.843
But he never filed it.

34:14.552 --> 34:17.722
Might have been in the stuff
that was stolen from his car.

34:17.805 --> 34:21.017
He was gonna file it the next day,
but he never got the chance.

34:22.435 --> 34:25.480
Jerry needed more time
because he didn't have shit

34:25.563 --> 34:26.981
and neither do I.

35:00.056 --> 35:04.644
So, we're set to begin voir dire
exactly one week from today. But…

35:06.020 --> 35:09.232
I'm yet to receive a motion
for continuance from you, Mr. Haller.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.113
Your Honor,
the People wouldn't oppose a continuance.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.116
We wanna avoid Mr. Elliott
claiming ineffective assistance

35:18.199 --> 35:22.245
because his lawyer was unprepared.
Especially given Mr. Haller's situation.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.831
And what situation is that?

35:24.914 --> 35:28.376
Mr. Haller has been away from
the practice of law for quite some time.

35:28.459 --> 35:32.004
I don't wanna cast aspersions,
but it's my understanding that his absence

35:32.088 --> 35:34.340
was due to his recovery
from a substance abuse--

35:34.423 --> 35:37.552
-Mr. Golantz, that's enough.
-Your Honor, this is outrageous.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.138
That is confidential
and completely irrelevant.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.305
-"Irrelevant"?
-Come on.

35:41.389 --> 35:42.765
-Goes directly…
-That's it?

35:42.849 --> 35:44.517
…to potential motion for a new trial.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.103
-Gentlemen. Enough.
-Come on.

35:48.771 --> 35:51.190
The stenographer will strike
that last exchange.

35:52.108 --> 35:55.528
Mr. Golantz, one more word,
and I promise you will not be happy.

35:57.029 --> 36:00.158
Mr. Haller,
the court is offering you a continuance,

36:00.241 --> 36:02.702
and clearly the People are in agreement.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.705
So?

36:07.665 --> 36:08.666
Your Honor…

36:11.752 --> 36:13.588
due to the circumstances,

36:14.881 --> 36:16.340
I'm afraid I have no choice--

36:16.424 --> 36:18.676
-I do not want a continuance.
-Don't, Trevor.

36:18.759 --> 36:20.344
-I don't want delays.
-Sit down.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.138
I'm the one who's on trial here.

36:22.221 --> 36:25.975
Mr. Elliott, in this session, in every
session, you will allow your lawyer

36:26.058 --> 36:30.021
to speak for you unless I say otherwise.
Do you understand me?

36:30.104 --> 36:32.607
-A moment with my client, please?
-Talk to him.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.947
-What do you think you're doing?
-What are you doing?

36:40.031 --> 36:42.200
I told you we go to trial with schedule.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.202
And I'm telling you that is a mistake.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.704
-I need more time.
-And I can't give you any.

36:48.581 --> 36:49.999
What are you not telling me?

36:51.292 --> 36:52.293
What do you mean?

36:52.376 --> 36:54.795
I mean,
we are talking about whether or not

36:54.879 --> 36:58.049
you go to prison
for the rest of your life, Trevor,

36:58.132 --> 37:00.259
and you couldn't make time
to meet with me.

37:00.343 --> 37:03.429
You won't even consider a delay.
What is your angle, Trevor?

37:03.512 --> 37:06.015
Because for the life of me,
I can't figure it out.

37:11.437 --> 37:12.521
I have lost…

37:14.232 --> 37:16.734
everything that matters to me.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.695
Almost everything.

37:20.947 --> 37:24.784
The one thing
that I have left is my Legacy.

37:25.910 --> 37:30.206
The technology I created,
the company Lara and I built from it.

37:30.289 --> 37:33.292
-What's that have to do with anything?
-I negotiated a deal.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.212
A very lucrative one
for my company to be acquired.

37:36.295 --> 37:39.382
For our technology to be licensed
all across the industry.

37:39.465 --> 37:42.510
That deal is how
I cement my place in history.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.138
That deal is how my investors get paid.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.474
But if this goes on any longer,

37:48.557 --> 37:51.978
or God forbid, we lose,
that deal goes away.

37:53.646 --> 37:56.232
And then I really
will have lost everything.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.113
But that's not gonna happen.
Is it, Mickey?

38:03.823 --> 38:06.534
Because you need this
just as much as I do.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.619
This is your one shot.

38:10.246 --> 38:14.041
So, you better take it,
or I will find someone else who will,

38:14.125 --> 38:16.294
even if I have to represent myself.

38:35.938 --> 38:37.189
So?

38:38.274 --> 38:40.901
-We'll be ready for trial next week.
-Sure?

38:40.985 --> 38:41.902
Yes, sir.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.449
I'd better not regret this, Mr. Haller.

38:49.618 --> 38:53.164
<i>You've reached Maggie</i>
<i>McPherson, please leave a message.</i>

38:53.247 --> 38:57.335
Hey, Mags, it's me. I just got
ambushed by this fucker, Golantz.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.295
Just call me back, will you?

39:05.051 --> 39:06.093
What if this is it?

39:07.136 --> 39:08.137
What do you mean?

39:08.846 --> 39:12.308
I keep thinking Jerry must have
had a plan, but what if he didn't?

39:13.059 --> 39:16.479
What if he just needed the money
'cause he blew it all here?

39:18.647 --> 39:22.401
What if Jerry
was just an addict, same as us?

39:27.740 --> 39:29.325
<i>We're heading back now.</i>

39:29.408 --> 39:31.869
If you hurry,
you might catch Jerry's assistant.

39:31.952 --> 39:36.082
<i>-Was she of any help with the finances?</i>
-No, she's pretty useless on everything.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.420
I'm thinking her and Jerry might have had

39:41.504 --> 39:44.090
<i>a more personal relationship,</i>
<i>if you catch my drift.</i>

39:46.509 --> 39:48.302
Lorna, keep her there.

40:05.861 --> 40:09.407
I just answered the phone.
We filed paperwork, stuff like that.

40:11.158 --> 40:15.121
Jerry never talked to me
about strategy or anything.

40:15.871 --> 40:19.250
He was a good man, you know?

40:20.584 --> 40:23.170
He was a really nice man.

40:24.797 --> 40:27.675
He was, he was a really nice man.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.386
And he was a really, really good lawyer,

40:30.469 --> 40:34.223
and that is why there is no way
Jerry would go to trial with nothing.

40:34.306 --> 40:38.602
He had to have something, and I owe it
to his client to do the best job I can.

40:39.395 --> 40:41.647
I mean, that's what
Jerry would want, right?

40:42.982 --> 40:46.110
So, please,
I need you to think really hard,

40:46.193 --> 40:49.196
if Jerry ever said anything to you, maybe,

40:49.280 --> 40:51.240
I don't know, maybe outside the office.

40:55.286 --> 41:00.124
The only thing he ever said
was that he had a magic bullet.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.127
-What was that again?
-He…

41:05.254 --> 41:08.507
A couple weeks ago,
before I went to see my mother,

41:10.134 --> 41:13.471
I woke up one night
and Jerry wasn't there.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.307
We…

41:16.891 --> 41:18.934
I don't wanna shock you,

41:19.018 --> 41:21.520
but by then,
we were spending most nights together.

41:24.398 --> 41:25.733
He said he couldn't sleep.

41:26.525 --> 41:29.487
There was something
he had to do for the Elliott case.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.238
He was so excited.

41:32.198 --> 41:35.326
And I asked what it was,
he said the less I knew the better.

41:35.951 --> 41:40.414
All he would tell me
was that he had this magic bullet.

41:41.916 --> 41:44.585
I'm sorry.
I don't even know what that means.

41:55.763 --> 41:56.889
Thank you.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.685
What was that all about?
What's a magic bullet?

42:01.769 --> 42:06.690
It means the thing that's gonna blow
the prosecution's case wide open.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.108
The thing that can't lose.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.194
We've all been searching for that.

42:10.903 --> 42:12.238
We've found nothing.

42:12.321 --> 42:14.532
Either we've been looking
in the wrong place

42:14.615 --> 42:18.244
or not looking hard enough.
He must've been hiding it. Don't know why.

42:18.327 --> 42:21.789
But Jerry had something,
meaning there's something to have.

42:21.872 --> 42:25.876
And if he could find it,
I can fucking find it.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.045
Yes! Where are you going?

42:28.128 --> 42:29.505
I think better on the road.

42:29.588 --> 42:31.465
Izzy, it's me. Pick me up in front.

42:41.058 --> 42:42.142
You okay?

42:43.102 --> 42:44.895
You're being awful quiet.

42:44.979 --> 42:48.691
I'm good. Better than good.
Here, plug this in, please.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.485
In the console right there.

43:20.931 --> 43:22.766
<i>Anybody following us today?</i>

43:23.475 --> 43:27.146
<i>Nope, not today. All clear.</i>

43:27.771 --> 43:29.315
<i>Outstanding.</i>

43:30.566 --> 43:32.276
<i>Take the freeway here, will you?</i>
