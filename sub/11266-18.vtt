WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.588
Previously on 90210:
When did this start?

00:04.630 --> 00:06.089
After my accident,
I figured out

00:06.131 --> 00:07.883
that getting high helps
with my stress.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.050
You have cancer?

00:09.092 --> 00:12.220
The doctors say I have three...

00:12.262 --> 00:13.681
maybe four years.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.056
Are you okay?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.059
I think I have
the hots for a nerd.

00:21.647 --> 00:23.607
Look, we're gonna have to
keep this on the down-low.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.734
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.988
Give me a call.

00:30.572 --> 00:31.615
It was me.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.450
I'm the one
who cheated with Navid.

00:33.492 --> 00:34.785
I know.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.119
He sent...

00:38.539 --> 00:41.375
(phones ringing)

00:50.342 --> 00:53.512
RADIO D.J.:
Buenos dias, Los Angeles!
Estan escuchando a...

00:53.554 --> 00:57.391
BOTH:
Latino 109.7!

00:57.432 --> 00:59.894
Really, with the
Mexican radio?

00:59.935 --> 01:01.520
Hey, before Christmas,
I listen to carols,

01:01.562 --> 01:02.855
so before Spring Break
in Cabo,

01:02.897 --> 01:05.816
I'm gonna listen
to Latino 109.7.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.234
Okay.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.445
Oh! I can't believe
that in less than 24 hours

01:10.487 --> 01:12.239
we're gonna be eating churros,

01:12.280 --> 01:15.743
dancing with mariachi bands
and swimming with the dolphins.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.036
Hopefully, not at the same time.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.871
Come on.
Get excited.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.706
I already have a plan
for all of us

01:20.748 --> 01:22.165
to go to "El Squid Roe."

01:22.207 --> 01:24.125
Ooh, sushi in Mexico--
that ends badly.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.293
It's not sushi.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.295
It's the coolest
club in Cabo.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.505
They have foam parties.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.966
Foam parties?

01:31.008 --> 01:33.092
You dance in giant pits of foam.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.469
Is that even sanitary?

01:34.511 --> 01:36.137
Come on!
It's the last chance

01:36.179 --> 01:38.473
for all of us to party
together in high school.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.558
You're gonna
dance in foam

01:39.600 --> 01:41.142
and you're gonna love it.
Mm-hmm.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.734
(guy wolf whistles)

01:50.611 --> 01:52.029
What's the matter?

01:52.071 --> 01:54.155
Nothing we haven't
seen before.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.036
Hey, babe!
(chuckles)

01:59.078 --> 02:01.329
Would you leave
the country with me?

02:01.371 --> 02:04.332
I was thinking, uh,
maybe Mexico.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.126
Yeah, sure.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.502
You okay?

02:07.544 --> 02:09.003
I'm fine.

02:09.045 --> 02:12.132
Just some jerks ogling
me because they saw

02:12.173 --> 02:13.968
Adrianna's picture
that she sent out. Yeah.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.803
Every time I walk
down the hall,

02:15.844 --> 02:17.763
I feel like I'm
in one of those

02:17.805 --> 02:18.889
airport scanner
X-ray things.

02:18.931 --> 02:19.890
Silver, I'm sorry...

02:19.932 --> 02:20.975
I hate her.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.684
I mean, I actually
hate her.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.728
Okay. You know what
we should do?

02:24.770 --> 02:25.771
What?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.355
We should leave
the country.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.568
You and me,
let's go.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.070
(school bell rings)

02:37.908 --> 02:41.161
Teddy!

02:41.202 --> 02:42.496
Marco.
Remember me?

02:42.537 --> 02:44.289
Oh, sure. Hey!
How you been?

02:44.331 --> 02:45.457
Been all right. You?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.876
Good. I mean, I'm blind in
the eye you hit,

02:47.918 --> 02:49.544
but I can still
play soccer.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.838
Don't feel bad or anything.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.090
I'd only feel bad if you
lost sight in both eyes.

02:53.132 --> 02:56.426
So what about that tennis lesson
you owe me?

02:56.468 --> 02:57.719
How about tomorrow?

02:57.761 --> 03:00.388
How about tonight?
Got a court in the backyard.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.223
My dad's out of town.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.893
Um...

03:04.935 --> 03:06.185
I-I have a game tonight.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.354
Right. Just come by after.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.941
We'll have the
place to ourselves.

03:10.983 --> 03:14.069
You know what? I'm not
looking for just a hookup.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.071
Okay.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.447
See you around.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.624
IVY:
Hey.
Hey. Hey, there, stranger.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.459
I haven't heard from you in
a while.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.252
I wanted to make sure
you didn't move

03:31.294 --> 03:33.172
or accidentally skate off
a cliff or something.

03:33.212 --> 03:36.717
Uh, nope. Nope, I'm still here.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.927
Well, that's a relief.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.013
You wanna come skate?

03:41.055 --> 03:47.728
Uh, you know, actually,
I'm, I'm pretty busy.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.396
I-I decided to take your advice

03:49.437 --> 03:52.733
and try to focus on school
and stuff.

03:52.774 --> 03:56.028
Yeah, yeah. No, um, it's cool.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.196
I get it.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.448
It's probably a good idea, so...

04:00.490 --> 04:03.660
Um, yeah,
I'll see you around.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.038
Yeah, okay. I'll see ya.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.581
Bye.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.052
Are we...?
Should we?

04:20.094 --> 04:21.053
I have prophylactics.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.137
Condoms.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.847
Are you sure
you're ready?

04:23.889 --> 04:26.225
I'm ready
if you're ready.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.143
Oh, I'm ready.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.353
Prepare to have
your world rocked.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.318
Wow.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.738
Wow.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.322
(chuckles)

04:41.364 --> 04:42.657
Yeah...

04:42.699 --> 04:45.535
You're like a prodigy.

04:45.577 --> 04:46.828
Well, thank you.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.122
No, seriously.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.539
I mean, that would

04:49.581 --> 04:51.166
have been incredible
even if you weren't a virgin.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.876
Oh, I'm not a virgin.

04:52.918 --> 04:57.256
Nor was I one prior
to this wonderful experience.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.882
You've had sex before?

04:58.924 --> 05:00.300
I have.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.761
With how many people?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.222
Oh, come on.
I don't want to kiss and tell.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.890
Tell me!
Max, how many?!

05:06.932 --> 05:10.060
All right, fine.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.187
Let's just say less than
the square root of 64.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.897
You've had sex with 64 people?

05:13.939 --> 05:15.857
(chuckles) Seven.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.068
Math isn't your specialty,
is it?

05:18.110 --> 05:22.156
Apparently,
it's not yours either.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.991
(laughs)

05:24.032 --> 05:25.867
I'm going
to miss you over break.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.328
Yeah. I'm going to miss you.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.165
I'm gonna miss this...

05:31.206 --> 05:34.626
Yeah, me, too.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.586
(chuckles)

05:42.217 --> 05:44.219
DIXON:
Wow, private jet. Dude,

05:44.261 --> 05:46.429
this is gonna be
the best vacation ever.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.973
Now this is the way
to travel:

05:48.015 --> 05:49.141
no lines,
no security,

05:49.183 --> 05:51.392
no crying babies in
the seat next to you.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.228
It's an international flight,
so there'll be

05:53.270 --> 05:54.729
lines and security on
the other end.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.397
Really?
Yeah.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.483
But, hey, at least
you're clear of
crying babies

05:58.525 --> 05:59.818
in the next seat.
Right.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.196
Unless you sit next to Navid.
(all laugh)

06:02.237 --> 06:03.113
Ooh.

06:04.865 --> 06:05.740
(horn honking)

06:07.492 --> 06:09.161
Vamos a Mexico, bitches!

06:09.203 --> 06:11.038
Whoo!

06:11.079 --> 06:12.580
Is that Max Miller?

06:12.622 --> 06:14.249
What is he doing here?

06:14.291 --> 06:16.584
Hi, everyone.
My math tutor Max.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.919
You brought a math tutor?

06:19.129 --> 06:20.630
I'm failing Pre Calc,

06:20.672 --> 06:22.674
and there's a huge test
when we get back.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.760
If I don't do well, I won't get
off the wait list for CU.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.679
Guess you've never been one
to pack lightly.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.348
(chuckles)

06:32.809 --> 06:34.186
Really?

06:34.228 --> 06:36.646
(snorts)
Who reads those things?

06:36.688 --> 06:38.815
Me. I read
these things.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.734
You should always be prepared
just in case of...

06:40.775 --> 06:42.319
Oh, my God!

06:42.361 --> 06:43.362
Disaster.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.157
Why is she here?!

06:47.199 --> 06:48.200
Okay, Silver's coming?

06:48.242 --> 06:49.284
Uh, not if you're coming.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.036
Yes, Sliver, sit down.
Yes, you are.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.120
You know what?

06:52.162 --> 06:54.331
It's fine. I'll leave.
Okay.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.790
I can't believe
you guys invited her.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.043
Stop it, both of you, all right?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.294
You both have done

06:59.336 --> 07:00.379
really horrible things
to each other.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.462
Really horrible things.

07:01.504 --> 07:05.050
And we get why
you're upset,

07:05.092 --> 07:07.426
but you're gonna have
to get over it

07:07.468 --> 07:10.055
because you're both
our friends, okay?

07:11.890 --> 07:13.350
Whatever.

07:13.392 --> 07:14.809
MAN (over P.A.): Hello, folks,
and welcome aboard.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.896
The cabin doors are closing.
Please buckle your seat belts

07:17.938 --> 07:19.647
and prepare for the flight.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.404
Watch out, Mexico,
here we come!

07:25.445 --> 07:26.905
(all cheering, whooping)

07:55.934 --> 07:57.685
Welcome to the
Burro Encantado.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.271
That means
"Enchanted Donkey."

07:59.313 --> 08:01.815
I see someone
read our Web site.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.691
The spa is just down
the hall.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.486
And of course, the beach
is just a short walk

08:06.527 --> 08:07.821
across the dunes, where
you will find parasailing,

08:07.862 --> 08:08.863
snorkeling, surfing,

08:08.905 --> 08:11.325
even swimming with
the dolfinas.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.826
See? I told you
there'd be dolfinas!

08:12.867 --> 08:14.244
HOST:
A few warnings.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.703
The riptides here are stronger

08:15.745 --> 08:17.747
than they are in California,
so be careful.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.167
And do not drink
the tap water,

08:20.208 --> 08:23.211
unless you want to spend your
vacation in your hotel room.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.423
Well, who needs water
when we have margaritas?!

08:26.465 --> 08:28.508
Whoo!
HOST: Bienvenidos.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.260
Bienvenido a Mexico!

08:30.302 --> 08:31.886
(all whoop)

08:35.015 --> 08:36.265
You all right back there?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.268
Your suitcase is bigger
than my closet.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.061
I like to have
clothing options.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.105
Never pegged you
as a over-packer.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.563
Like an onion, baby.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.484
Layer after layer.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.277
Yeah, layer after layer
of clothing options.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.987
Okay, 103.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.664
(door slams)

09:03.335 --> 09:04.378
Uh...

09:04.419 --> 09:05.504
(door slams)

09:08.089 --> 09:10.758
Uh... Silver?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.891
This is a great room.
(gasps) Guac!

09:17.932 --> 09:19.684
Oh, yes! I'm starving.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.685
(chuckles)

09:20.727 --> 09:23.188
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.356
The bedspread's
really not my taste,

09:24.398 --> 09:26.566
but, luckily,
I brought a spare.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.943
What?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.320
Tell me you're kidding.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.113
I'm kidding.

09:34.199 --> 09:37.327
Mmm! Right?! Mmm!

09:37.369 --> 09:38.578
So good!

09:38.619 --> 09:40.580
You're really digging
that guacamole, huh?

09:40.621 --> 09:41.622
Mmm-mm! Mmm-hmm!

09:41.664 --> 09:45.793
Mmm-hmm! Oh, yeah.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.795
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

09:47.837 --> 09:49.464
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, yeah!

09:49.506 --> 09:50.757
Yeah-yeah-yeah!

09:50.798 --> 09:52.800
Oh, my God, Navid! Yeah!

09:52.842 --> 09:56.971
(muffled):
Oh, yeah! Oh, my God!

09:57.013 --> 10:01.017
(thumping)
Oh, God!

10:01.059 --> 10:03.478
Yes, yes! Oh!

10:09.526 --> 10:11.736
Buenos dias,
novio guapo!

10:13.613 --> 10:14.989
It's 7:32.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.325
Exactly. Which means
we're already behind schedule.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.453
It's our first day in Cabo
and we have so much to do:

10:19.494 --> 10:22.163
like zipline in the jungle and
shopping in the mercado.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.957
Oh, and it would be so great

10:23.998 --> 10:26.251
if we could squeeze
in lunch at this

10:26.293 --> 10:28.169

Silver!

Why is she so red?

33:41.394 --> 33:42.855
You did this.

33:42.896 --> 33:44.105
What are you talking about?

33:44.147 --> 33:46.065
How can I give you a sunburn?

33:46.107 --> 33:47.776
You messed with my sunscreen.

You asked for it, Ade.

the e-mail?

Yeah.

You bitch!

I'm sorry.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.649
I screwed up.

more responsibility.

our friendship back.
