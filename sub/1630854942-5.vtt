Yes, I'm sorry, it's just...
Hudson is upset.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.951
He overheard Cooper
saying something about court,

03:21.951 --> 03:23.953
and now he's worried you're in trouble.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.415
Okay, put him on, please.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.379
Mommy, are you and Daddy going to jail?

03:33.379 --> 03:34.297
<i>No, honey.</i>

03:34.297 --> 03:36.049
No, no. No one's in trouble.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.469
We're just gonna tell the judge
what we worked out

03:39.469 --> 03:42.263
about how we're gonna
take care of you, and...

03:42.889 --> 03:44.474
nothing is changing.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.226
Promise?

03:46.851 --> 03:48.686
I promise. Yes.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.856
Mommy and Daddy love you...

03:53.149 --> 03:55.777
so very much, and that will never,

03:56.694 --> 03:57.946
ever change.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.115
Hudson, I...

04:01.908 --> 04:04.911
I'm gonna be home this afternoon
and maybe...

04:05.995 --> 04:08.206
we can do something special
together, okay?

04:08.206 --> 04:10.375
Okay. I love you, Mommy.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.129
I love you too, baby.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.061
- Billie?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.021
What is it?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.107
You okay?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.234
It's today.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.696
The divorce. And, um...

04:41.197 --> 04:44.117
Hudson found out, and he's upset,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.327
and clearly so am I.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.955
I told him that...

04:50.248 --> 04:53.668
we would do something special
this afternoon, and...

04:55.378 --> 04:58.715
hopefully it'll distract him and me.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.466
My God. I'm sorry.

05:00.466 --> 05:04.137
Today turned out to be way more emotional
than I thought it would be, you know?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.847
It's a big day.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.851
It's just, the dream I had for my life...

05:12.603 --> 05:13.938
The life I was living.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.609
It's over.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.280
Maybe it's time to dream a new dream.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.490
I don't know.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.872
You don't think that what we have
is a dream come true?

05:31.456 --> 05:32.832
Maybe that's just me.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.085
Is what we have even real?

05:36.753 --> 05:40.381
Or have I just been distracting myself,

05:40.381 --> 05:43.009
not thinking about the reality of my life.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.595
The reality of your life is I love you.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.555
And you love me.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.475
But you don't even know me.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.852
I mean, not all of me.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.896
I'm a mom.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.314
I wear jeans and sneakers,

05:56.314 --> 06:00.193
and I clean up puke, and I change diapers.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.987
We don't even talk about my kids.

06:02.987 --> 06:07.241
I never talk about my kids with you.

06:07.241 --> 06:09.285
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

06:11.746 --> 06:15.958
I've been trying to figure out why...

06:18.044 --> 06:20.505
I haven't shared this part of myself.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.342
Maybe I didn't think you'd be interested.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.720
I wanted to be free and fun.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.639
And it has been fun, but...

06:31.307 --> 06:33.309
I'm not my full self...

06:34.435 --> 06:35.520
when I'm with you.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.480
And that's been my problem.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.691
That's what got me to D-Day
in the first place, so...

06:40.691 --> 06:43.611
I have to do this for real.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.072
You're right.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.533
I'm sorry.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.995
I never thought about all of this.
I should have, but...

06:53.913 --> 06:56.624
I've never dated a woman
who has kids before.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.418
Yeah, I've been enjoying the ride,

06:59.418 --> 07:02.213
but I do want to know all of you.

07:03.172 --> 07:06.676
Including your mom side
and including your kids.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.595
You want to meet my kids?

07:09.595 --> 07:10.763
Let's do it today.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.599
You said you want to do something special
to make them feel better.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.725
Let's do this.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.396
Are you sure?

07:18.396 --> 07:19.814
Absolutely.

07:21.941 --> 07:25.236
I'm excited there's a part of you
that I don't know yet.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.071
Is it--?

07:27.697 --> 07:28.739
Is it here?

07:29.198 --> 07:30.241
Mm...

07:31.451 --> 07:33.035
Or here?

07:33.035 --> 07:34.871
Maybe.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.373
Or maybe it's...

07:42.753 --> 07:46.007
Okay, look, good news is,
it'll be quick and painless.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.342
At least the part with the judge.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.136
I'm just glad
it will all be over.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.491
Willamina Connelly and Cooper Connelly,

08:11.491 --> 08:14.035
the court has reviewed
your divorce settlement.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.411
By signing it,

08:15.411 --> 08:18.748
the plaintiff and the defendant
attest to the following:

08:18.748 --> 08:22.543
You will have joint custody
of your children, Hudson and Ellary,

08:22.543 --> 08:28.174
with each party entitled to spend 182 days
with them per year...

08:28.174 --> 08:30.384
<i>Suddenly, eight years of marriage</i>

08:30.384 --> 08:34.472
<i>was reduced to a collection of property,
expenses, and schedules.</i>

08:35.681 --> 08:39.227
<i>All those moments
I thought we'd always treasure together.</i>

08:39.936 --> 08:41.270
<i>Who gets them?</i>

08:43.272 --> 08:44.941
Oh, my God, was that it?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.776
- That was it?
- That was it.

08:56.327 --> 09:01.749
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Hudson ♪</i>

09:01.749 --> 09:06.837
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪</i>

09:11.634 --> 09:12.969
I love you.

09:13.970 --> 09:14.887
Ms. Connelly.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.724
I'm sorry. Yes?

09:19.850 --> 09:22.478
Have all attempts at reconciliation
been exhausted?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.862
Yes, they have, Your Honor.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.740
All parties are in agreement
on the terms of the divorce.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.325
All right. Very good.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.578
Please sign the settlement agreement.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.760
<i>For years,
you are something, everything,</i>

09:54.760 --> 09:55.803
<i>to one another.</i>

10:02.810 --> 10:04.145
<i>And then suddenly...</i>

10:05.271 --> 10:06.272
<i>you're nothing.</i>

10:07.690 --> 10:08.858
<i>It's over.</i>

10:08.858 --> 10:11.444
<i>And no matter how much
you think you're ready for it,</i>

10:12.403 --> 10:13.237
<i>you're not.</i>

10:13.237 --> 10:15.281
The court hereby grants your divorce.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.122
Thank you. I'll call you on Monday.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.457
We'll talk then.

10:25.875 --> 10:26.751
Cooper.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.463
Cooper.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.134
Hi, Billie. It's nice to see you.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.845
I wish it were under
different circumstances.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.142
Hey.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.063
I'm sorry. Um...

10:50.483 --> 10:52.610
I think I just really needed a hug.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.613
We'll always be family. You know that.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.782
Thank you, Spence.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.534
That means so much, because this is...

11:01.243 --> 11:02.203
awful.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.124
It's tough for everybody.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.378
I'm gonna let you two talk
and I will call you later.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.295
Yup.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.591
I wanted to, um--

11:16.676 --> 11:17.843
To check-in.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.055
That was pretty intense.

11:22.431 --> 11:23.724
At least for me.

11:25.309 --> 11:28.813
I know this isn't
what either of us hoped for...

11:29.605 --> 11:30.606
Um...

11:32.149 --> 11:35.194
But we can't judge our marriage...

11:36.612 --> 11:38.531
by the worst things that we did.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.534
And we can't judge each other,

11:42.243 --> 11:44.245
or ourselves, that way either.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.706
We have to honor all the beautiful moments

11:47.706 --> 11:49.333
to keep them alive.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.795
For our kids' sake, if nothing else.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.548
They should know who we are.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.925
They should know who we were together.

12:07.726 --> 12:10.229
I can't think about it, Billie. All right?

12:12.314 --> 12:14.400
I'm not gonna make it if I do.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.485
Oh, Cooper, please.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.530
I mean, if you keep
pushing all of this down,

12:19.530 --> 12:22.324
then it's only gonna come back
to hurt you even more.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.702
Thanks, doc. I'll take my chances.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.246
Okay, look, we can't leave it like this.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.499
See, actually, we can.
That is the beauty of the day.

12:30.499 --> 12:33.377
Everything's figured out,
so we don't ever have to talk again.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.171
Okay, yes, we do.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.757
I'm sorry to have to bring this up
today of all days,

12:38.757 --> 12:40.676
but it's happening this afternoon.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.595
So, I, uh...

12:43.888 --> 12:45.556
I've been seeing someone.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.641
His name is Majid Mousavi.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.935
He owns a restaurant in Manhattan.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.479
It's gotten serious,

12:51.479 --> 12:54.106
and I want him to meet the kids.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.692
We decided that it would be...

12:57.526 --> 12:58.569
today.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.905
Oh, you decided, huh?

13:03.324 --> 13:05.493
Hey, I mean, I guess if it's today,

13:05.493 --> 13:07.953
well, then I don't get a choice, right?

13:08.746 --> 13:10.289
But thanks for the FYI.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.128
Yo! Connelly!

13:16.128 --> 13:18.422
Happy fucking divorce, buddy.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.757
Let freedom ring.

13:20.382 --> 13:21.383
Hi, Billie.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.762
Come on, get in the car.
Let's blow this joint.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.472
Cooper.

13:33.562 --> 13:34.688
Have a great afternoon.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.981
Cooper.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.194
Hell is this thing?

13:40.194 --> 13:42.947
This is a mid-engine Corvette Stingray.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.491
Goes 0 to 60 in 2.9 seconds.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.327
And it still cannot get me
away from Trina fast enough.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.955
Look, I know I tried to sleep with Franny.

13:51.830 --> 13:52.748
Multiple times.

13:52.748 --> 13:53.958
Never got in.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.835
And you never got to finish with Trina,

13:56.835 --> 13:58.754
at least this time. So it's a lose-lose.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.464
We're even, no apologies,

14:00.464 --> 14:02.758
because husbands say they're sorry,

14:03.384 --> 14:06.262
but real men, we say, "Suck on it."

14:07.388 --> 14:08.222
Let's go.

14:10.140 --> 14:10.975
I don't know, Dev.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.019
I'm not really
in a party mood right now. The...

14:14.937 --> 14:16.438
divorce has been brutal.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.732
Oh, divorce is awesome.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.110
Best money you ever spent. Come on.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.696
We got the rocket ship
to go anywhere we want.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.698
Say goodbye to misery.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.701
Say, "Hello, gorgeous,"
to the greatest night of our lives.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.370
It's over, dude.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.081
You hung on way longer than you should've.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.792
Now you gotta make up for lost time.

14:39.962 --> 14:40.880
Let's do it.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.256
Now we're talking.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.970
- Got you a parting gift.
- Oh, Dev.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.057
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

15:16.790 --> 15:17.708
Fuck it.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.044
Yeah.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.296
Buckle up, baby!

15:22.296 --> 15:24.423
We're going to Disneyland!

15:29.929 --> 15:34.183
Sash, these last three months
have been amazing. Your brand is on fire.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.476
Single Girl Cruises,

15:35.476 --> 15:38.646
Third Way Education Vacations,
Girls Night Out across the country.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.981
Plus, the lingerie line
is through the roof.

15:40.981 --> 15:44.610
And the new vibrator sold out on Amazon.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.527
Amazing.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.031
I'm glad my message is getting out there.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.658
And Mick wants to talk.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.661
He's thinking about doing
the new book as a stealth release.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.622
Just dropping it online,
kind of like <i>Lemonade.</i>

15:58.248 --> 16:01.669
It's not gonna be free,
don't worry about that.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.171
Right.

16:04.171 --> 16:07.466
But, boom, once it's out there,
we jam it into all the book clubs.

16:07.466 --> 16:12.638
Oprah, Reese, Jenna Bush,
Emma Watson, Kaia Gerber.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.806
What's happening?

16:14.682 --> 16:16.058
Do you see a celeb?

16:16.850 --> 16:18.644
Oh, no.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.982
I saw Dua Lipa here last week.
She is so skinny.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.193
We have the same Prada mini bag.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.654
- Dua Lipa. Cool.
- Mm-hm.

16:31.865 --> 16:33.200
Um...

16:34.994 --> 16:37.454
You know what?
This wine is running right through me.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.666
- I'm just gonna use the ladies' room.
- Yeah.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.209
- Be right back.
- Okay.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.352
Oh, my God. Kam?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.229
Sasha.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.024
How are you?

17:05.607 --> 17:06.650
Great.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.027
How's your new book coming?

17:09.028 --> 17:12.364
Almost done.
Already planning the next tour.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.450
Everything's...

17:15.325 --> 17:16.618
really good.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.747
Well, glad to see you're so happy.

17:21.165 --> 17:21.999
Take care.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.128
I miss you.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.678
Sorry.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.306
I know you're on a date.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.269
She's a colleague.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.981
I'm helping her with a speech
she's giving at the UN.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.359
Wow, impressive.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.527
Sash?

17:52.946 --> 17:55.115
I thought you said the doc was done.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.451
You better hope Mick doesn't find out.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.624
Really sorry about that.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.292
Just like old times.

18:05.876 --> 18:06.710
Look...

18:08.670 --> 18:10.631
I know you don't owe me anything.

18:12.966 --> 18:16.095
Do you think we could get a drink
and talk?

18:17.471 --> 18:20.974
Someplace not by a bathroom
while people are waiting for us.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.685
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important,

18:23.685 --> 18:24.978
but...

18:26.855 --> 18:27.898
I need this.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.488
Why is Majid your boyfriend
and not your friend?

18:35.489 --> 18:38.534
Well, he's my friend and my boyfriend.

18:38.534 --> 18:42.329
Does he have kids or a dog?
Does he know Daddy?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.331
No, no, honey.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.542
He does not know Daddy.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.755
Hi, we're on our way.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.758
I'm so excited to see you.

18:54.758 --> 18:56.802
It's like I'm even more
turned on knowing--

18:56.802 --> 18:59.304
And you're on speakerphone!

18:59.304 --> 19:00.931
<i>- Ah.</i>
- Ah.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.015
<i>Sorry!</i>

19:02.015 --> 19:04.518
Hey there, Hudson and Ellary.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.813
We're gonna have an awesome time today.
I cannot wait to meet you.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.648
Okay.

19:10.274 --> 19:14.736
All right then,
we'll see you soon, boyfriend.

19:14.736 --> 19:15.946
<i>See you, baby.</i>

19:18.073 --> 19:20.075
Why did he call you a baby?

19:27.666 --> 19:28.917
- Smell that?
- Mm-hm.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.837
That is the scent of possibility,
my friend.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.840
Suck it in all the way down to your balls.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.341
Oh, yeah.

19:38.594 --> 19:42.389
My man, two shots of Patron
and you're going to keep them coming.

19:43.307 --> 19:48.437
Aw, shit. I'm missing this presentation
with Deutsche Bank.

19:48.437 --> 19:52.232
Oh, dude, tell Heinrich and Gandalf
to <i>küss deinen</i> ass!

19:53.192 --> 19:55.027
- You know what, you're right.
- Yeah.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.737
Fuck it. Cheers.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.032
To never having to visit
with Trina's awful parents

20:00.032 --> 20:02.951
in fucking Toledo ever again.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.495
Here's to never having to pretend

20:05.495 --> 20:07.706
that the craziest lingerie outfit
she wears

20:07.706 --> 20:09.333
don't make her look like a total whore.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.126
- Cheers to that.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.044
All right.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.715
We gotta figure out
your divorce bucket list, right?

20:16.715 --> 20:19.301
All the shit you're gonna do
with your newfound freedom.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.803
- Top three. Go.
- No, I don't know!

20:21.803 --> 20:25.933
I'm gonna get--
I'm gonna get a bachelor pad in the city.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.310
- Yeah.
- With a big screen TV.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.355
I'm gonna watch the game
whenever the hell I want

20:31.355 --> 20:34.107
without anyone trying to fuck me
in the middle of it.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.442
Come on, bigger!

20:38.946 --> 20:42.783
Yeah, I'm gonna learn to surf
in the Maldives.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.160
- Bigger!
- I'm gonna go to space.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.663
- There you go.
- With fucking Musk and Bezos.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.915
I'll find that roadster
he launched up there.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.833
I'm gonna drive that bitch around Mars.

20:51.833 --> 20:56.380
Or we can just find some chicks
to shag here tonight, right?

20:56.380 --> 20:58.048
Yes, on Mars.

20:58.674 --> 21:02.261
Dude, trust me,
ditching she-who-shall-not-be-named

21:02.261 --> 21:05.722
is going to be the best decision
you've ever made in your life, all right?

21:05.722 --> 21:08.058
Do you have any more that coke?
Did we bring that?

21:08.058 --> 21:13.397
Easy, space cowboy,
how about we just examine our prospects?

21:15.649 --> 21:17.276
- Ooh.
- Mm-hm.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.820
I got dibs on the redhead.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.364
Fine. You can have her first.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.954
Bottle of Cristal, four glasses.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.747
Yes, sir. Coming right up.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.042
Ladies.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.585
Who's up for some champers?

21:36.211 --> 21:37.170
Sure.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.465
I'm Piper, this is Bianca.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.426
What are we celebrating?

21:43.593 --> 21:44.428
Freedom.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.390
Hey, free man. Is it snowing out?

21:53.979 --> 21:56.064
Any more where that came from?

21:56.064 --> 21:59.276
Why don't you ladies come up
to our room and find out.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.612
- We have a room?
- Yes.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.114
We have the Shangri-La Suite,

22:04.114 --> 22:07.034
because I told you
tonight is going to be a celebration.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.794
- Mommy, look.
- It's beautiful.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.380
- Can we stop, Mommy? Please?
- Okay. Yes.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.132
But just for a minute, okay?

22:24.468 --> 22:25.344
Oh!

22:27.054 --> 22:28.221
Wow.

22:53.413 --> 22:54.372
Billie.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.002
Is this your boyfriend?

23:00.879 --> 23:06.343
No. No, this is my old friend, Brad.

23:08.512 --> 23:12.474
This is Ellary and this is Hudson.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.060
I remember.

23:15.727 --> 23:16.603
Yeah.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.647
How you going, little man?

23:18.647 --> 23:21.900
Up top. Right there. Oh, that's nice.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.153
Hey, they're cool kicks.
Wish I had a pair.

23:25.153 --> 23:28.198
- Maybe I can borrow yours, huh?
- Your feet are too big.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.658
What? These?

23:31.701 --> 23:32.786
I guess you're right.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.748
And who's this little one?

23:37.374 --> 23:38.834
This is my son.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.460
Hendricks.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.296
Wow, Hendricks.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.422
Yeah.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.760
Look at you. You did it.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.305
You're a dad.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.348
Yeah.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.102
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.646
But whatever happened to the--?

24:01.481 --> 24:04.234
Well, the last time
we spoke things were...

24:04.901 --> 24:06.611
- Complicated?
- Yeah.

24:06.611 --> 24:07.779
Yeah.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.657
I did lose the company.

24:11.366 --> 24:12.951
Oh, my God, Brad.

24:12.951 --> 24:16.663
It turns out it doesn't even matter.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.916
It's being a father. This...

24:21.710 --> 24:23.628
This is what I was born to do.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.174
And I'll get back to it at some point.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.801
Start all over again
with new artists. So...

24:31.219 --> 24:32.095
It's all good.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.893
And what about Gigi?
Is she okay with everything?

24:41.396 --> 24:42.647
She loves her son.

24:44.983 --> 24:45.984
Billie.

24:47.694 --> 24:48.612
Hi, babe.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.198
Brad.

24:54.576 --> 24:55.452
Congrats.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.037
Thanks, mate.

24:57.037 --> 25:03.168
Uh, Majid, this is Hudson.
This is Hudson and this is Ellary.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.129
- So great to finally meet you guys.
-  Yeah.

25:06.129 --> 25:08.590
Oh, come on, you know how
to shake hands. Come on.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.593
- Hey.
- I should get out of here.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.552
Why?

25:16.681 --> 25:19.476
- It was great running in to you, Billie.
- Yeah. You too.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.064
What a day.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.607
Hey, it's not over yet.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.566
Yeah.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.402
Today is ours.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.631
Give me those pants, hot shot.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.800
-  Want them?
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.972
Cute little panties there, Tarzan.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.891
- That's hot.
- Yeah. Yeah, I like my junk secured.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.231
What can I get you?

26:06.231 --> 26:07.732
I'll take a Jack and Coke.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.194
Feels a bit like
a Jack and Coke kind of night?

26:16.408 --> 26:20.537
You know what?
Let's just skip the Jack, huh?

26:21.288 --> 26:22.622
And go straight to the coke.

26:27.043 --> 26:31.506
Whoa. I bet you can't get
all that in a oner.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.174
I got this.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.181
Oof!

26:40.932 --> 26:43.351
- Yeah.

26:43.351 --> 26:44.894
I love this song.

27:02.912 --> 27:05.540
I am a golden god!

27:06.499 --> 27:10.337
Yo, Machine Gun Connelly, your shot.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.635
-  Fuck.

27:17.635 --> 27:20.180
Dude, you're supposed to walk
around the furniture.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.808
Well, who put the fucking chair there, huh?

27:23.808 --> 27:25.185
Huh?

27:25.185 --> 27:26.519
Fuck this chair.

27:26.519 --> 27:30.273
- Hey, fuck this chair! Fuck this chair!
- Fuck this chair!

27:30.273 --> 27:35.737
<i>Fuck this chair!
Fuck this chair! Fuck this chair!</i>

27:47.123 --> 27:49.125
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

27:49.125 --> 27:51.544
Just take the shot. Just take the shot.

27:51.544 --> 27:52.462
Come on.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.714
Ladies, ladies! Bras.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.180
-  Who is it?

28:05.308 --> 28:06.810
That looks hard.

28:06.810 --> 28:10.397
No. I'll show you how.
You can do this. Just, uh, knee first.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.857
Hold it above your knee and buck,
kick your knee up.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.319
Try again, try again, try again.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.529
You got it.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.740
Okay, do it one more time, one more time.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.368
I hate this game!

28:24.327 --> 28:25.954
Your mom said you love soccer.

28:32.419 --> 28:38.508
Um, okay. You know, when I was little,
every time I tried to kick a ball,

28:38.508 --> 28:40.301
I fell on my butt,

28:40.802 --> 28:45.765
but I kept trying because the only way
you get better at something

28:45.765 --> 28:48.143
is through perseverance.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.519
You can't give up so easy.

28:50.603 --> 28:51.771
You said "butt."

28:52.939 --> 28:58.611
Yes, yeah, I said "butt,"
because when I was little,

28:58.611 --> 29:00.196
I fell on my tiny butt,

29:00.196 --> 29:02.949
and if I fall now,
I fall on my big, big butt.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.576
Oh, my God, you have a butt.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.495
He has a butt! Everyone has a butt!
There's butts everywhere.

29:07.495 --> 29:11.291
There's so many butts!
Butts, butts, butts!

29:13.042 --> 29:14.878
You know what's a better word than butt?

29:14.878 --> 29:18.631
Chocolate!
Does little miss cutie like chocolate too?

29:19.257 --> 29:21.092
She certainly does.

29:21.092 --> 29:24.971
Hey, what do you say
we go to my restaurant

29:24.971 --> 29:27.932
and order one of everything
on the dessert menu.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.893
You ever heard of a Nutella lava melt?

29:29.893 --> 29:32.479
- I love Nutella.
- High five. Unh!

29:32.479 --> 29:35.315
Okay. Let's go. Leave your car.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.484
It's a few blocks.
It's a nice day. Let's walk.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.485
Okay.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.869
Let's walk.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.497
Here we go!

29:54.083 --> 29:57.253
It's been a crazy ride
these last few months.

29:57.796 --> 29:58.755
I'm sure.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.300
With the foundation, the vibrator.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.053
I saw the billboard.

30:05.845 --> 30:06.721
Can't miss it.

30:08.515 --> 30:10.099
And the crossword.

30:11.684 --> 30:12.519
Right?

30:15.814 --> 30:20.485
Still it hasn't been everything
I thought it would be.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.363
Because something's missing.

30:25.907 --> 30:26.950
You.

30:28.576 --> 30:31.621
It's been like
standing on Kilimanjaro all alone.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.832
Until today.

30:33.832 --> 30:38.628
You walked in
and I felt this jolt of electricity

30:38.628 --> 30:39.796
through my whole body.

30:39.796 --> 30:44.425
I felt that too, but these last few months
have been really hard, Sash.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.179
I've been dreading running into you.

30:49.222 --> 30:53.768
Because that's how this town is.
I just knew if I saw your face...

30:58.189 --> 30:59.274
I'd be done for.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.552
What are you doing?

31:29.012 --> 31:30.054
I don't know.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.560
All I do know is that I love you.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.396
I want to be with you.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.316
I don't know how to make that happen,

31:41.316 --> 31:44.903
but you are what I want.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.577
Okay. All right.
Look, how about 10 Benjamins

31:52.577 --> 31:54.579
and my wife's ticket
to <i>Jagged Little Pill?</i>

31:54.579 --> 31:56.372
You know you want to go with me.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.266
I guess it's time to head home.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.394
I'm gonna miss the two of you
all night long.

32:18.394 --> 32:19.354
No.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.483
I don't wanna go home.
It's the last place I wanna go.

32:23.483 --> 32:26.235
Sorry, hot shot, but our fun is done.

32:26.235 --> 32:29.530
Unless, of course, you wanna
put some more money in the meter.

32:31.991 --> 32:34.577
Yes. Okay, I hired them.

32:34.577 --> 32:37.497
But, dude, it was only to guarantee
a great fucking time

32:37.497 --> 32:39.707
and a great time fucking.

32:42.001 --> 32:45.046
And you really thought
that two hours was gonna do it?

32:45.046 --> 32:46.756
Oh!

32:47.924 --> 32:49.133
Really?

32:49.133 --> 32:53.012
Ladies, how much
for the rest of the night?

32:54.347 --> 32:55.390
Five grand.

32:56.265 --> 32:57.266
Each.

33:01.688 --> 33:02.897
You take Apple Pay?

33:02.897 --> 33:05.650
Apple Pay, Zelle, Venmo,

33:05.650 --> 33:08.111
and PayPal for you old guys.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.530
- Shit, this is fucking awesome, bro.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.619
Wow. Cool car.

33:16.619 --> 33:18.830
Yeah, that's insane.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.874
But... where do we sit?

33:23.584 --> 33:26.004
- Oh, shit.
- You're right. Yeah.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.214
Piper and I could sit on your lap...

33:28.214 --> 33:29.882
or maybe call an Uber.

33:30.925 --> 33:34.012
No, I got a better idea.

33:59.245 --> 34:02.206
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.584
- We need to talk. We need to talk.
- No.

34:06.252 --> 34:11.424
Look, there are a million things
that don't make sense right now,

34:12.091 --> 34:13.301
but please,

34:14.552 --> 34:16.304
let's just have this one moment.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.556
You and me.

34:20.975 --> 34:21.851
Together.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.569
<i>♪ I know it hurts ♪</i>

34:33.821 --> 34:35.490

35:35.091 --> 35:36.884
We can have all of this?

35:36.884 --> 35:38.219
I brought it for you.

35:38.219 --> 35:42.223
Clearly you have never been around kids
on a sugar high.

35:42.223 --> 35:46.060
Come on, it's a special day.
A little chocolate never hurt anyone.

35:46.060 --> 35:48.646
Can Majid come to my soccer game tomorrow?

35:49.939 --> 35:56.487
Um... Well, it's not up to me.
I mean, it's up to Majid.

35:57.446 --> 35:58.865
I would be honored.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.241
Yay!

36:03.327 --> 36:05.621
Uh, okay, you two, enjoy.

36:05.621 --> 36:09.542
I just need a minute
to talk to your mom. Okay?

36:09.542 --> 36:12.420
Okay. Whoa, Maj,
I can't leave my kids all alone

36:12.420 --> 36:15.131
in a busy restaurant
in the middle of New York City.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.132
Don't worry.

36:16.132 --> 36:19.844
Hey, Barb, can you sit
with my little friends for a sec?

36:19.844 --> 36:21.012
Happy to, boss.

36:23.764 --> 36:25.308
I just need a minute.

36:32.523 --> 36:33.733
Oh.

36:35.943 --> 36:37.069
How'd I do?

36:38.362 --> 36:39.322
Gold star!

36:40.531 --> 36:42.491
A-plus! Blue ribbon!

36:44.202 --> 36:46.370
Mm. Maj, what are you doing?

36:46.370 --> 36:47.788
I just want you so much.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.041
Okay, yeah. Well, I want you too,

36:50.041 --> 36:52.793
but I really do
have to get back to the kids.

36:55.546 --> 36:58.049
Yeah. You're right. I'm sorry.

37:00.509 --> 37:01.510
But...

37:03.387 --> 37:04.555
I know...

37:05.473 --> 37:10.937
one way that you could be
at Hudson's game tomorrow.

37:13.272 --> 37:16.108
Come stay with us in Connecticut tonight.

37:18.945 --> 37:19.820
You sure?

37:22.782 --> 37:24.450
This feels good.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.036
We feel good.

37:27.828 --> 37:30.706
I mean, I never thought
this is how today would end, but...

37:32.458 --> 37:34.085
Maybe we are the new dream.

37:36.545 --> 37:40.216
Sometimes your worst day can be your best.

37:49.809 --> 37:53.896
Trust me, it's a lot cheaper than a wife
and a hell of a lot more fun.

37:53.896 --> 37:57.358
Delivery service, baby,
that's some white glove shit right there.

37:57.358 --> 37:58.818
Hey, you're welcome.

37:59.777 --> 38:00.861
Thanks for coming out.

38:00.861 --> 38:02.113
My pleasure.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.448
Don't worry, this will make you happy.

38:07.326 --> 38:10.288
Hey, let's get out of here.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.622
Where did you have in mind?

38:11.622 --> 38:14.041
Wherever these 'vettes
can stretch their legs a bit.

38:14.041 --> 38:15.918
Let's see what these babies can do.

38:15.918 --> 38:19.297
How about some place
I can show you what I can do?

38:19.297 --> 38:21.424
How about we hot tub it up?

38:21.424 --> 38:23.175
Trina took the kids to her parents'.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.593
So I got the house to myself.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.429
Beep, boop, bap, boop.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.015
Spa module activated.

38:29.015 --> 38:33.394
I don't want to go to Greenwich.
We're in a New York state of mind.

38:34.186 --> 38:38.357
We're going backcountry, bro.
See what these babies can do.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.072
That was amazing.

38:46.365 --> 38:50.244
That has never been our problem.

38:54.123 --> 38:58.002
Look, I know we need to talk.
What did you want to tell me before?

39:01.130 --> 39:02.173
Well...

39:04.425 --> 39:06.010
these past few months...

39:07.011 --> 39:09.138
a lot's been happening for me too.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.143
First Do No Harm is expanding to Asia.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.147
Setting up an operation center
in Singapore.

39:18.147 --> 39:21.817
It'll double the number
of people we can serve.

39:21.817 --> 39:22.985
So...

39:25.404 --> 39:27.490
So, what are you trying to say?

39:28.824 --> 39:29.992
I leave in a month.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.787
Oh, my God.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.539
I knew I needed to get out of New York

39:35.539 --> 39:39.460
if I had any chance of getting over you.

39:40.586 --> 39:43.464
I figured I'd never run into you
on Kay Poh Road.

39:43.464 --> 39:46.759
So I drove you out of town?

39:46.759 --> 39:51.222
Well, you are a big part of the reason
why I came back in the first place.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.600
At least the hope of you.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.149
I know.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.612
We're right back where we were
all those years ago.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.993
But I would never
be able to live with myself

40:14.203 --> 40:17.540
if I didn't at least ask.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.712
- Come with me.

40:24.672 --> 40:25.548
Kam.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.552
I don't know.

40:31.137 --> 40:32.721
There's no right or wrong answer.

40:34.014 --> 40:35.224
Whatever you decide.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.561
You'll always be my dream.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.074
Hi, hold on.

40:55.619 --> 40:56.954
Ellary's still awake?

40:56.954 --> 40:59.790
This is what happens
when you jack little people up on sugar.

41:08.507 --> 41:11.427
I know, I know. Okay.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.304
Wow, this house is beautiful.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.263
Yeah.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.223
- A little bigger than your New York place.
- Oh.

41:17.933 --> 41:20.853
Oh. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

41:20.853 --> 41:24.190
Ah. Welcome to my other life.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.192
I gave Olga the night off, so...

41:26.192 --> 41:28.736
Okay, there's wine in the fridge.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.489
I'm gonna put Ellary to bed
and I will be back in 10.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.449
I'm good, don't stress.

41:50.382 --> 41:52.176
It's so weird to be back here.

41:53.469 --> 41:55.179
What do you mean back?

41:55.179 --> 41:57.056
I grew up in Connecticut.

41:57.056 --> 42:00.518
My parents still live here.
Married for 35 years.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.810
Living the dream.

42:03.270 --> 42:06.315
No, fuck that dream. This is the dream.

42:13.072 --> 42:16.825
Sorry. It took forever to get Ellary down.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.870
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.174
Long day.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.222
Yeah. Yeah.

42:41.308 --> 42:42.768
I should, uh...

42:42.768 --> 42:44.436
I should probably take a shower.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.730
Maybe...

42:48.399 --> 42:51.360
you could come with me?

42:53.404 --> 42:55.114
Do you want to come upstairs?

42:55.990 --> 42:57.449
Are you sure?

42:58.033 --> 43:00.119
It is why I asked you here.

43:07.835 --> 43:08.836
Whoo!

43:08.836 --> 43:10.421
This is crazy.

43:11.797 --> 43:13.924
It's an Algonquin word. Did you know that?

43:14.717 --> 43:16.885
- What did you say?
- Connecticut.

43:16.885 --> 43:20.472
The Native Americans
were here long before us, so...

43:20.472 --> 43:22.141
<i>That's an Algonquin word.</i>

43:23.517 --> 43:26.312
"Land of the Long Tidal River."

43:26.895 --> 43:28.105
I always loved that.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.899
I don't want to talk about Connecticut.

43:30.899 --> 43:31.900
Okay?

43:45.039 --> 43:46.540
That's Cooper.

43:49.376 --> 43:51.920
I've been meaning to replace that.

43:51.920 --> 43:56.008
I just wasn't sure what to do.
I thought maybe the kids...

43:58.510 --> 43:59.428
Come here.

44:07.186 --> 44:11.440
Okay, I get it.
You're clearly a family man.

44:11.440 --> 44:14.151
Everyone out here is married with kids.

44:14.151 --> 44:17.404
Let me guess:
a boy and a girl, one of each.

44:17.404 --> 44:19.907
You seem like a guy
who gets everything right.

44:20.449 --> 44:22.868
Where are my babies?
Come here, bud.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.915
- Oh, you are so gigantic.

44:28.832 --> 44:33.837
- No, I'm not married. Not anymore.

44:49.311 --> 44:53.232
<i>♪ Eyes on screen to left of me... ♪</i>

44:54.316 --> 44:58.904
So that's what tonight's about, huh?
You want me to help you forget?

44:59.822 --> 45:01.448
I can certainly try.

45:02.574 --> 45:03.409
Don't.

45:05.494 --> 45:16.797
<i>♪ Baby, don't turn your back to me ♪</i>

45:16.797 --> 45:18.132
<i>♪ Baby, don't turn... ♪</i>

45:18.132 --> 45:19.508
I know it's hard,

45:20.050 --> 45:23.011
because there are a lot of good moments
mixed in with the bad.

45:23.011 --> 45:26.056
And if you forget them,
it's like they never even happened, right?

45:26.056 --> 45:27.474
What are you doing?

45:41.447 --> 45:44.783
But they did happen.
All those beautiful moments.

45:44.783 --> 45:46.201
Stop talking.

45:46.201 --> 45:48.996
And you need to honor them.

45:49.955 --> 45:52.458
For the kids, if nothing else.

45:58.338 --> 46:01.842
All those beautiful moments.

46:07.681 --> 46:09.933
- Shit.
