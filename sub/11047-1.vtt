WEBVTT

02:44.457 --> 02:47.252
[female] Listen up, 'cause
I'm only tellin' you this once.

02:47.252 --> 02:49.921
I'm not a bedtime story lady,
so pay attention.

02:49.921 --> 02:51.798
It's 2033.

02:51.798 --> 02:53.967
The world is screwed now.

02:53.967 --> 02:57.387
You see, a while ago, this humongous
comet came crashing into the Earth.

02:57.387 --> 02:59.430
<i>Bang!
Total devastation.</i>

02:59.430 --> 03:01.474
End of the world as we know it.

03:01.474 --> 03:04.978
No celebrities,
no cable TV, no water.

03:04.978 --> 03:06.688
It hasn't rained in 11 years.

03:06.688 --> 03:09.941
Now, 20 people gotta squeeze
inside the same bathtub.

03:09.941 --> 03:11.860
So, it ain't all bad.

03:21.077 --> 03:23.037
[brays]

03:24.998 --> 03:26.875
That's me-- the one in the mask.

03:26.875 --> 03:29.252
No, the other one in the mask.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.212
Today's my boyfriend's birthday.

03:31.212 --> 03:34.132
So, I'm out shopping
for that perfect gift--

03:34.132 --> 03:35.633
whatever I can scrounge up.

03:48.563 --> 03:50.857
Uh-oh, Ripper leftovers.

03:52.692 --> 03:53.776
[whistles]
[brays]

03:53.776 --> 03:58.406
The Rippers are a demonic army
of bloodthirsty, human eating,

03:58.406 --> 04:01.159
purse snatching,
mutant creatures.

04:01.701 --> 04:03.995
Witness exhibit A.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.498
Uchh!, you are so dead.

04:07.498 --> 04:09.626
They're led by the infamous
Johnny Prophet.

04:09.626 --> 04:12.086
They spend most of their time
raidin' the WP.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.088
That's short
for Water and Power.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.757
They control most of the water

04:15.757 --> 04:17.675
and got all the power.

04:45.954 --> 04:47.830
Oh, wait, one last thing.

04:47.830 --> 04:51.626
My friends and me, we do not suck up
to Water and Power.

04:51.626 --> 04:55.046
Yeah, we steal water,
but as long as they don't find out,

04:55.046 --> 04:56.297
who gives a shit?

05:02.095 --> 05:05.056
Ah, there it is--
home sweet home.

05:08.559 --> 05:09.894
A thing of beauty.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.438
I'm gonna go water
the vegetables.

05:22.073 --> 05:24.909
Hey, Town, you fixed the pump, right?
I'm going down.

05:24.909 --> 05:26.369
[male]
Yeah, go for it.

05:27.412 --> 05:29.664
[water gurgling]

05:45.722 --> 05:46.764
Shit.

05:47.390 --> 05:50.101
[Russian accent]
You've been stealing water.

05:50.101 --> 05:51.644
What gave you that idea?

05:51.644 --> 05:53.771
Take off your clothes.

05:53.771 --> 05:56.107
Ohh! agh!
[cocks gun]

05:56.107 --> 05:57.650
- Now!
- Shit.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.193
Right, right, right, right...

06:15.084 --> 06:16.294
There.

06:18.296 --> 06:20.256
Did I tell you to stop?

06:21.424 --> 06:22.759
Ohh.

06:26.512 --> 06:27.722
Now...

06:31.726 --> 06:33.603
Salute me.

06:34.687 --> 06:36.606
I'm not too good under pressure.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.359
Well, you'll learn then,
won't you?

06:42.403 --> 06:43.821
Gross out.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.531
Come on,
they're being weird again.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.325
Let's get outta here.

06:47.325 --> 06:48.868
Let go.

06:48.868 --> 06:50.119
Damn!

06:52.205 --> 06:54.290
Hah, I was just gettin'
into that one.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.751
Give me that.

06:56.751 --> 06:58.461
[laughing]

07:13.017 --> 07:14.102
Hey, Sam.

07:15.478 --> 07:18.272
I thought you was working
on my Doris Day bust.

07:18.272 --> 07:21.442
I didn't trade you my specially
autographed Doris picture

07:21.442 --> 07:23.778
just for whatever this is.

07:24.362 --> 07:27.824
I know, but the wood talks to me.

07:27.824 --> 07:29.158
It said, "Ripper."

07:29.158 --> 07:30.201
[chuckles]

07:30.201 --> 07:32.578
How would you know
what one looks like?

07:32.578 --> 07:34.080
No one's ever seen a Ripper.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.791
No one's ever seen
your peanut dick either.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.377
- I'm tellin'.
- Go ahead.

07:39.377 --> 07:41.879
[male] Rebecca,
don't forget guard duty.

07:50.763 --> 07:52.306
[glasses jingle]

07:59.564 --> 08:00.815
[Kesslee]
Ah.

08:01.774 --> 08:05.862
Adam was dust
until God injected him with life.

08:05.862 --> 08:08.614
And do you know
what was in that injection?

08:10.366 --> 08:12.577
Water.

08:12.577 --> 08:14.287
Water is life.

08:14.287 --> 08:16.247
Water is power.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.333
Well done.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.378
You've all done
a masterful job.

08:22.378 --> 08:26.048
Ninety-five percent of the desert
and all the water it contains

08:26.048 --> 08:28.426
now belongs
to Water and Power.

08:29.427 --> 08:33.264
Well, I think that deserves
a little toast.

08:34.682 --> 08:37.643
To Captain Derouche

08:37.643 --> 08:41.772
for securing most of the desert.
[chuckles]

08:41.772 --> 08:43.607
Captain Derouche.
[clink]

08:43.607 --> 08:45.318
[all]
Captain Derouche.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.657
I can promise you, sir,

08:51.657 --> 08:54.035
the Rippers will only be
a minor setback.

08:54.035 --> 08:55.077
Hmm.

08:55.077 --> 08:57.288
Once I take care of them,

08:57.288 --> 09:00.124
that final crack of land
will be ours.

09:07.381 --> 09:10.009
This crack of land, Captain?

09:10.009 --> 09:13.054
Hm, hm, well,
just a small crack.

09:13.054 --> 09:15.097
Doesn't matter,
we'll let that go.

09:15.097 --> 09:16.140
Hmm.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.351
[crash]

09:19.894 --> 09:21.187
Oh, my!

09:21.187 --> 09:23.064
Now look what's happened.

09:23.064 --> 09:24.941
We lost the Feta Plains.

09:27.068 --> 09:29.070
[crash]

09:29.070 --> 09:30.863
And the Tenelson Ridge.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.075
[crash]

09:34.075 --> 09:35.493
And so on!

09:37.119 --> 09:38.454
[shattering]

09:44.210 --> 09:48.506
There are three million liters of water
underneath the Blue Dunes.

09:48.506 --> 09:51.008
And you will retrieve it.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.511
Do I make myself clear,
gentlemen?

09:54.178 --> 09:56.472
[all]
Yes, sir.

09:56.472 --> 09:57.765
Good!

10:00.309 --> 10:02.228
Remove your boots, Captain.

10:12.196 --> 10:13.739
Now, come here.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.557
The fool.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.813
It was foolish not
to carry out my order.

10:45.813 --> 10:49.442
And it was foolish to walk across
a floor full of glass.

10:49.442 --> 10:51.277
If I were you,
I wouldn't have done it.

10:51.277 --> 10:53.696
I would have killed me first.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.282
But you lack that courage,
don't you, Captain?

10:59.785 --> 11:00.953
[whispers]
Come closer.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.418
Well.

11:09.587 --> 11:11.339
[chuckles]

11:16.218 --> 11:17.261
Uh!

11:46.624 --> 11:48.501
Ah.
[chuckles]

11:50.294 --> 11:52.755
Sergeant Small,

11:52.755 --> 11:54.882
it's your show now.

11:58.052 --> 11:59.428
Please,

12:01.263 --> 12:03.015
try not to let me down.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.058
[Sergeant Small]
Yes, sir.

12:15.486 --> 12:17.029
Lovely.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.205
[female] I take guard duty
very seriously.

12:30.876 --> 12:33.629
[singing]

12:48.728 --> 12:51.731
Elvis, Elvis, come out and play.

12:51.731 --> 12:55.067
Hey, baby, what do you say,
me and you, Vegas?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.040
Bollocks!

13:34.231 --> 13:35.357
Boo!

13:36.609 --> 13:37.651
Rebecca?

13:38.444 --> 13:39.528
Rebecca?

13:39.945 --> 13:41.238
Rebecca?

13:42.156 --> 13:44.450
Rebecca?
Rebecca!

13:44.450 --> 13:47.661
Ha ha, got you.
[chuckles]

13:47.661 --> 13:49.330
You butt smear.

13:49.330 --> 13:52.249
What'd I tell you?
Don't say butt smear.

13:52.249 --> 13:56.086
It's not becoming.
Say... asshole.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.379
Or dickwad.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.215
- Trade you.
- What?

13:59.215 --> 14:01.967
I'll sneak you some food
for that danger ball you found.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.428
I don't know.
You know how to work it?

14:04.428 --> 14:06.263
- Mm-hm.
- If you don't...

14:06.263 --> 14:08.224
[clank]
you're steak tartare.

14:09.725 --> 14:12.228
[click]
All right.

14:12.228 --> 14:14.730
First, go get me my food.

14:18.776 --> 14:20.736
[clicking]

14:26.325 --> 14:28.953
Happy birthday.
[giggles]

14:48.973 --> 14:50.850
I knew you couldn't resist me.

14:56.230 --> 14:57.731
Snip snip.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.693
Don't come any closer.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.363
You gotta stay there.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.615
And watch.

15:33.934 --> 15:37.730
Okay, you can come
a little bit closer.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.944
But you can't touch.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.447
[cocking]

15:49.783 --> 15:51.410
[beeping]

15:53.787 --> 15:54.955
Hi.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.961
Lose the scissors.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.046
Shit.

16:06.258 --> 16:07.676
[men's voices]

16:13.015 --> 16:14.683
Water and Power,
hands in the air!

16:15.601 --> 16:17.269
[machine gun fire]

16:19.355 --> 16:21.315
[clamoring]

16:21.315 --> 16:22.733
[female]
Over here, over here!

16:22.733 --> 16:23.901
[male]
It's the troopers.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.946
Confirmed, they've
been siphoning water.

16:29.073 --> 16:31.325
Well, keep going.

16:31.325 --> 16:33.118
We're just gettin'
to the good stuff.

16:35.371 --> 16:37.039
[laughing]

16:38.040 --> 16:40.042
Ooh, yeah.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.422
<i>Okay-</i>

16:50.260 --> 16:51.553
Uh!

16:59.895 --> 17:01.855
- Drop something?
- Huh?

17:01.855 --> 17:02.898
Ha ha.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.566
Aww, shit.

17:12.574 --> 17:13.701
[cocking]

17:38.851 --> 17:42.438
Rebecca, help!
Rebecca!

17:43.022 --> 17:45.107
- Sam!
- Rebecca!

17:48.152 --> 17:49.778
[yelling]

17:52.656 --> 17:53.907
No!

17:56.702 --> 17:57.953
Richard!

17:59.371 --> 18:01.457
[machine gun firing]

18:04.293 --> 18:05.794
[yells]

18:21.018 --> 18:22.436
Come on!

18:22.436 --> 18:24.563
[clamoring]

18:24.563 --> 18:25.898
Shit!

18:28.859 --> 18:30.194
We got her!

18:31.528 --> 18:32.863
[cocking]

18:34.615 --> 18:37.201
You've been stealing water.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.995
- Not smart.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:39.995 --> 18:42.414
We could have a lot of fun
with this one.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.999
[mooing]

18:45.084 --> 18:46.752
[trooper]
Well, well.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.422
Don't you know
you shouldn't own animals?

18:51.423 --> 18:52.674
[howling]

18:55.469 --> 18:57.179
There's a water shortage.

19:01.517 --> 19:03.060
There's your water.

19:03.477 --> 19:04.561
Uh!

19:13.403 --> 19:15.280
Hey, you.

19:16.657 --> 19:19.034
Look at me when
I'm talkin' to ya.

19:27.084 --> 19:28.961
That cut looks painful.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.131
I like pain.

19:34.383 --> 19:36.009
And what else do you like?

19:39.263 --> 19:40.722
Hot oil.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.142
Vacuum attachments.

19:43.142 --> 19:44.434
Yeah?

19:45.227 --> 19:46.645
Yep.

19:47.729 --> 19:51.024
Hey, which of you gorgeous guys

19:51.024 --> 19:53.527
would like an oil change, hm?

19:53.527 --> 19:55.654
[chuckling]

19:55.654 --> 19:58.323
Don't be stupid,
she's gonna bite it off.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.914
The moment I feel teeth,

20:05.914 --> 20:07.666
you feel lead.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.001
[zipping]

20:12.588 --> 20:16.049
Well, what are you waiting for?

20:16.049 --> 20:18.468
I'm gonna need
a microscope and tweezers.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.887
It's like, uh--

20:24.266 --> 20:26.518
You know, you're gonna
have to stop this.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.020
You're really gettin' me hot.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.400
[crunch]

20:33.400 --> 20:34.693
[cocking]
Freeze!

20:36.778 --> 20:38.447
What?

20:52.878 --> 20:54.838
[water running]

20:54.838 --> 20:57.216
[birds chirping]

21:11.396 --> 21:12.856
Ah, ah.

21:16.902 --> 21:18.487
She's all yours, sir.

21:24.117 --> 21:28.038
Just how many
of my men did you kill?

21:29.706 --> 21:31.083
Mm-mm.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.877
[clears throat]
Eight, sir.

21:36.129 --> 21:39.049
Eight, eight,
the burning eight.

21:39.049 --> 21:42.135
Between Sunday and Monday
hangs a day so dark,

21:42.135 --> 21:44.638
it will devastate.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.767
Excuse me.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.854
Hey.

21:54.690 --> 21:59.111
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

22:01.446 --> 22:03.949
Look, you want to torture me,

22:03.949 --> 22:07.411
spank me, lick me?
Do it.

22:07.411 --> 22:11.081
But if this poetry shit continues,
just shoot me now please?

22:11.081 --> 22:12.916
[laughs]

22:14.710 --> 22:17.587
What, and waste all that talent?

22:19.172 --> 22:21.633
I'm offering you
the chance of a lifetime.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.552
The honor of working for me.

22:25.554 --> 22:27.139
[whispers]
Not interested.

22:29.933 --> 22:32.227
[whispers]
Not yet.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.109
Put her to work.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.904
[male]
Dig or die!

22:42.904 --> 22:44.948
You people are pathetic!

22:44.948 --> 22:47.117
[male #2]
Come on, get back to work!

22:47.117 --> 22:49.703
[male #3] These water pipes
should have been dug yesterday!

22:50.954 --> 22:52.664
Hey, just stand still.

22:52.664 --> 22:54.624
Hey, this scum's got a knife.

22:54.624 --> 22:57.169
[clamoring]

23:06.053 --> 23:07.679
<i>[male]
Enjoying yourself?</i>

23:10.599 --> 23:11.725
Uh!

23:13.935 --> 23:16.104
Hey, what time is it?

23:16.104 --> 23:17.356
I don't want to miss Bay Watch.

23:18.148 --> 23:20.067
[yells]

23:31.703 --> 23:34.706
Hey, Jess, how's the jet, Jet?

23:37.292 --> 23:38.835
I asked you a question!

23:41.296 --> 23:43.757
There are stress cracks
in the main engine turbine blades.

23:43.757 --> 23:46.218
And the manifold pressure sensor's
leaking like a sieve.

23:47.803 --> 23:49.679
I'm doing a full teardown.

23:49.679 --> 23:51.556
I'll have her back together
by Wednesday.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.767
You'll have her back together
by morning.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.477
I don't care if you have
to work all night.

23:56.478 --> 24:00.690
That is, of course, unless you want
to make me change my mind.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.193
Uh!

24:03.193 --> 24:04.694
I'll have it fixed by morning.

24:09.866 --> 24:13.120
[female voice] Failure to recycle
body fluids is a violation.

24:14.788 --> 24:19.000
Number four--
Hoarding water rations is a violation.

24:20.585 --> 24:25.424
<i>Number five-- syphoning body fluids
from another prisoner is a violation.</i>

24:27.217 --> 24:32.097
Number six-- Tampering with
no smoking devices is a violation.

24:34.057 --> 24:37.227
[violations continue]

25:13.221 --> 25:15.015
[yelling]

25:15.015 --> 25:16.641
[male]
What is your problem?

25:17.642 --> 25:20.145
I have gone out of my way
to be nice to you!

25:20.145 --> 25:23.356
If it wasn't for me, you would just be
another whore around here.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.818
Now, all I'm askin' for

25:26.818 --> 25:28.737
is just a little bit in return.

25:30.197 --> 25:33.241
Quit pickin' on my girlfriend.

25:40.415 --> 25:41.791
Uh.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.168
Shit.

25:43.168 --> 25:46.213
Uh, God, that is--
[spits]

25:46.213 --> 25:47.547
Thanks.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.007
It worked.

25:50.467 --> 25:51.718
What worked?

25:55.055 --> 25:57.015
Mn'! oh! my God-

25:57.015 --> 25:58.642
[giggles]

26:05.607 --> 26:06.816
[female voice]
End of shift.

26:06.816 --> 26:09.110
All prisoners return to cells.

26:09.110 --> 26:13.240
End of shift.
All prisoners return to cells.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.450
[clamoring]

26:27.879 --> 26:30.382
[buzzer sounds]

26:58.326 --> 26:59.869
Ahh!

27:05.458 --> 27:06.668
Heh, heh, heh.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.339
[Rebecca]
I'm in love.

27:21.099 --> 27:23.101
Ba-ba-ba-bam.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.284
Cool.

27:43.246 --> 27:45.332
[computer voice]
Systems check, stand by.

27:45.624 --> 27:48.501
Check, check,
check, check, check.

27:48.501 --> 27:50.420
Please enter security signature.

27:51.296 --> 27:53.214
My mom and your mom
were hangin' out clothes.

27:53.214 --> 27:56.551
- Security signature invalid.
- Shit.

27:56.551 --> 28:00.096
You have ten seconds before cyanide
gas is injected into the chamber.

28:00.096 --> 28:03.642
- <i>Go, go!</i>
- <i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

28:03.642 --> 28:07.937
seven, six, five, four,

28:07.937 --> 28:11.232
three, two, one.

28:21.284 --> 28:22.744
Oh, no.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.128
You know the security code
to this thing?

28:32.128 --> 28:33.797
Yeah, yeah.

28:33.797 --> 28:35.715
Good, then get me outta here.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.052
Go, do it.

28:39.052 --> 28:41.221
Get to cranking.

28:41.221 --> 28:42.722
They're hijacking a tank.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.017
Sir, if you want my opinion--

28:46.017 --> 28:47.727
No, I don't.

28:48.687 --> 28:50.563
Places to wreck,
people to do.

28:52.232 --> 28:55.402
[stuttering]
This tank, it isn't--

28:55.402 --> 28:58.321
isn't, isn't--

28:58.321 --> 28:59.823
- isn't--
- What?

29:00.198 --> 29:02.701
Come on, just one little adjective,
we'll have a whole sentence here.

29:02.701 --> 29:04.494
The tank isn't--
Glad.

29:05.495 --> 29:06.913
Sad.

29:06.913 --> 29:08.540
Mad.

29:08.540 --> 29:11.251
- Um--
- Lonely.

29:11.251 --> 29:12.711
[sighs]

29:12.711 --> 29:14.629
It isn't op-- op-- operational.

29:16.464 --> 29:18.299
How do I know you're not lyin'?

29:18.299 --> 29:21.845
Because, if I was lying, your lungs
would be full of cyanide gas.

29:23.012 --> 29:25.432
Cool, so we get a new tank.

29:25.432 --> 29:26.683
Wait, wait.

29:26.683 --> 29:29.060
Um!

29:29.060 --> 29:32.105
Nobody gets out of here
without a clearance.

29:32.105 --> 29:33.940
We're all prisoners here.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.317
And if-- if they catch you--

29:36.317 --> 29:39.571
Then they'll, don't tell me,
they'll take away my TV privileges.

29:39.571 --> 29:41.030
I'll live with it.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.535
My, my.

29:45.535 --> 29:47.829
She'll be fun to break.

29:57.172 --> 29:59.424
- [gasps]
- How's your lover?

29:59.424 --> 30:01.217
Huh?

30:01.217 --> 30:03.678
Yeah, I wouldn't get
too attached.

30:03.678 --> 30:05.555
She's not going to be around
much longer.

30:11.436 --> 30:14.647
Well, I bet you just can't wait to
take this baby for a test run, huh?

30:15.648 --> 30:17.901
That's too bad.

30:17.901 --> 30:21.070
'Cause you just lost
your flying privileges.

30:21.070 --> 30:25.200
And, uh, the whole hangar
is off limits too.

30:26.618 --> 30:27.911
You happy?

30:43.301 --> 30:44.594
[frustrated yelp]

30:47.639 --> 30:50.225
[crying]

30:53.978 --> 30:55.313
Miss me?

30:55.897 --> 30:57.649
What-- what are you doing?

30:57.649 --> 30:59.984
Oh, I was just thinking
about leaving this place.

30:59.984 --> 31:01.945
It's been swell,
but the swelling's gone down.

31:04.239 --> 31:06.825
What do you reckon?
We go to New York, see Cats.

31:07.534 --> 31:11.079
You-- you don't understand.

31:12.163 --> 31:17.001
The-- the better you behave,
the more they leave you alone.

31:17.001 --> 31:21.673
And the more they leave you alone,
the better off you are.

31:21.673 --> 31:23.842
Well, that's a bore.

31:26.469 --> 31:27.804
There's nuttin' to be scared of.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.724
You just gotta think about it like

31:31.724 --> 31:33.351
the first time you got laid.

31:33.351 --> 31:37.689
You just gotta go,
"Daddy, are you sure this is right?"

31:37.689 --> 31:40.692
Oh, you're sick.

31:40.692 --> 31:41.985
How come you always do that?

31:41.985 --> 31:44.696
How come you always cover
your mouth when you smile?

31:44.696 --> 31:46.155
You got bad teeth or somethin'?

31:46.155 --> 31:50.827
- Mm, I don't know.
- Come on.

31:51.828 --> 31:53.079
What do you say we bolt?

31:53.079 --> 31:54.372
[clunk]
Oh!

31:56.749 --> 31:59.168
You know, I'm really startin'
to like it here.

31:59.168 --> 32:02.213
People are nice, food's great,
and I love my job.

32:03.548 --> 32:05.216
I can see why you want
to hang around.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.093
[door closes]

32:25.320 --> 32:26.696
Morning.

32:36.873 --> 32:40.209
It's really hard for me

32:40.209 --> 32:43.171
to play with myself
in this thing.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.299
That's a shame.
[chuckles]

32:47.967 --> 32:51.971
Look, you want to play,
I'll play.

32:51.971 --> 32:53.556
And I'll win.

32:53.556 --> 32:56.100
No, not if it's Monopoly,

32:56.100 --> 32:57.810
'cause I really kick ass
at that game.

32:59.812 --> 33:02.231
But, I get to be the shoe.

33:04.067 --> 33:07.737
I'm going to ask you
just one more time.

33:07.737 --> 33:10.281
Do you want to work
for Water and Power?

33:10.823 --> 33:14.994
Oh, yeah, that sounds groovy.

33:14.994 --> 33:17.246
I get to wear
a cute little outfit like yours?

33:18.081 --> 33:19.207
[clang]

33:27.131 --> 33:28.716
[chuckles]

33:34.430 --> 33:35.473
The pipe.

33:36.808 --> 33:38.935
You're gonna
really love this one.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.356
Goes down 40 meters.

33:43.356 --> 33:45.274
[clanging]

33:47.986 --> 33:51.072
You'll get smaller and smaller
the deeper you go.

33:51.072 --> 33:52.991
Sounds wicked.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.619
Can I go first?

33:56.619 --> 33:57.578
[chuckles]

34:04.043 --> 34:06.254
I hope you're not
claustrophobic.

34:07.422 --> 34:08.755
Drop her.

34:20.143 --> 34:21.310
Uh!

34:25.356 --> 34:26.649
Bye.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.360
[clang]

34:29.360 --> 34:31.654
[gasping]

34:36.199 --> 34:37.534
No!

34:39.245 --> 34:40.580
No!

34:45.877 --> 34:48.129
Don't go.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.589
Help!

34:50.380 --> 34:52.050
Rebecca!

35:17.658 --> 35:19.869
[click]
Full metal.

35:21.537 --> 35:24.165
They didn't even have a chance
to squeeze off a round.

35:25.166 --> 35:27.919
[Kesslee] Another outpost
lost to those Rippers.

35:27.919 --> 35:30.630
At this rate, we'll lose
all our water.

35:30.630 --> 35:33.341
Rippers must have come up
from some underground sub gate.

35:35.009 --> 35:40.098
Well then, I know just
the young lady to help us find it.

35:40.098 --> 35:41.599
Absolutely, sir.

35:53.778 --> 35:55.113
Uhh.

35:58.950 --> 36:04.163
Hmm, well, I'm so glad
you see things my way now.

36:05.414 --> 36:07.125
You know what I see?

36:09.127 --> 36:10.545
No.

36:11.295 --> 36:12.713
What?

36:12.713 --> 36:16.050
This big

36:16.050 --> 36:18.010
honkin' booger

36:18.010 --> 36:20.805
hangin' outta your left nostril.

36:20.805 --> 36:22.223
If I was you,

36:22.223 --> 36:27.645
I'd use this finger
to pick it out.

36:27.645 --> 36:29.397
[bonk]
Uhh.

36:33.151 --> 36:34.610
[chuckles]

36:36.529 --> 36:38.239
I win.

36:44.495 --> 36:46.164
Yeah.
[chuckles]

36:46.164 --> 36:47.582
Lucky you.

36:49.333 --> 36:52.003
And just wait till you see
what you've won.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.734
- Excuse me. [bang]
- Ow!

37:15.985 --> 37:18.070
Relax, it's only a locator.

37:18.070 --> 37:21.240
[chuckles]
This is your pulse.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.283
[beeping]

37:22.283 --> 37:24.911
Now I'll always be close
to your heart.

37:26.329 --> 37:27.413
[exhales]

37:27.413 --> 37:30.958
Your job is to penetrate
this sub gate we found,

37:30.958 --> 37:32.960
which could be the entrance
to the Ripper's base.

37:34.587 --> 37:37.173
Most of these are booby-trapped,
so if we hear a loud bang--

37:38.758 --> 37:40.009
Sorry.

37:40.009 --> 37:42.345
If not, congratulations,

37:42.345 --> 37:44.222
you just found the Ripper's hideout.
[chuckles]

37:44.222 --> 37:46.474
Either way, I win.

37:47.892 --> 37:51.145
Like a piece of cheese
at the end of a fishing hook.

37:51.729 --> 37:53.064
That's you.

37:53.064 --> 37:54.065
Ready.

37:54.607 --> 37:55.733
- Move.
- Uh!

38:13.125 --> 38:15.002
[commotion and firing]

38:16.337 --> 38:17.880
[male]
Rippers!

38:19.548 --> 38:20.675
Arrgh!

38:22.802 --> 38:25.972
Condor Control, Condor zero five,
I'm detecting Ripper activity.

38:26.847 --> 38:28.933
[yelling]

38:48.411 --> 38:49.912
Wha?

38:56.836 --> 38:58.170
[snarling]

39:02.550 --> 39:03.968
Oh, my God.

39:08.431 --> 39:10.099
[growls]

39:49.013 --> 39:51.307
That's what you get
for messin' with me.

39:59.273 --> 40:00.483
Mine.

40:02.151 --> 40:04.111
[beeping]

40:04.111 --> 40:05.738
Well, what do you know?

40:07.031 --> 40:09.742
Am I close to your heart now,
Kesslee?

40:09.742 --> 40:11.786
What happened
to the rest of you?

40:12.870 --> 40:13.913
Butthead.

40:19.335 --> 40:20.419
Cool.

40:21.921 --> 40:23.255
Shit.

40:32.098 --> 40:33.891
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

40:35.017 --> 40:36.602
I thought the Rippers got you.

40:36.602 --> 40:37.853
Hell, no.

40:40.231 --> 40:41.315
Come on, let's go.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.693
I ain't goin' back there.

40:44.693 --> 40:45.945
Your gonna have
to kill me first.

40:45.945 --> 40:48.447
No, I'm not.

40:52.243 --> 40:54.537
'Cause I'm not gonna
go back there either.

40:57.498 --> 40:59.708
We're free.
[laughs]

40:59.708 --> 41:01.627
[ominous sounds]
Oh, no.

41:02.795 --> 41:04.547
We better go before
they come back for us.

41:04.547 --> 41:05.756
You take the tank.

41:09.343 --> 41:10.928
Are you sure?

41:21.981 --> 41:23.774
Go, go, all right.

41:33.367 --> 41:34.702
Rebecca!

41:35.453 --> 41:36.787
Don't leave.

41:37.413 --> 41:39.582
No! Rebecca, come on!

41:41.292 --> 41:43.335
Rebecca, turn the engine off!

41:46.088 --> 41:48.007
Kill the engine!

41:49.842 --> 41:51.760
You're crazy!
[bonk]

42:02.521 --> 42:04.815

Rebecca?

58:03.565 --> 58:04.899
Rebecca!

58:06.025 --> 58:07.652
Rebecca!

58:07.652 --> 58:08.611
Ah!

58:09.821 --> 58:11.406
[yelling]

58:14.159 --> 58:16.369
[coughing]

58:22.083 --> 58:25.211
Jet, what took you so long?
[giggles]

58:25.211 --> 58:26.212
[Clunk]

58:27.130 --> 58:28.256
What?

58:29.507 --> 58:30.800
Uh!

58:31.468 --> 58:32.427
What?

58:34.804 --> 58:36.222
[groans]

58:37.307 --> 58:40.143
[male]
See hell, go to hell.

58:44.481 --> 58:45.523
Duhh.

58:45.523 --> 58:47.942
Oh, my God,
it's the elephant man.

58:47.942 --> 58:49.360
[bang]

58:52.030 --> 58:55.074
Hey, Quasimodo guy,
we're hungry in here!

58:55.074 --> 58:56.493
How 'bout some food.

58:57.202 --> 58:59.037
- Ah!
- Now, you've done it.

58:59.037 --> 59:00.705
[Coughing

59:00.705 --> 59:02.332
We're dead.

59:26.856 --> 59:32.612
So, like... what are your names?

59:32.612 --> 59:34.322
[sniffing]

59:34.322 --> 59:36.241
[giggling]

59:37.033 --> 59:41.829
- Give me the gas.
- And like, what are you doing here?

59:41.829 --> 59:45.708
Is it true what they say
about guys with big shoes?

59:45.708 --> 59:47.710
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

59:47.710 --> 59:49.921
He asked you a question.
Answer it!

59:49.921 --> 59:53.007
Hey, I have two words for you.

59:53.007 --> 59:54.259
Brush your teeth!

59:54.259 --> 59:56.594
[giggling]

59:57.887 --> 59:58.930
They're spies.

59:58.930 --> 01:00:00.932
They got Water and Power
logos all over 'em.

01:00:00.932 --> 01:00:02.267
Yeah, I was thinkin' that, right?

01:00:02.267 --> 01:00:06.104
But then, I was also thinkin' that
if they are Water and Power,

01:00:06.104 --> 01:00:07.730
No, no, no, don't you.

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:10.024
Why would they come here
advertising it?

01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:11.609
- [giggling]
- Check it out.

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:12.860
Tattoos.

01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:14.487
Give me that.

01:00:14.487 --> 01:00:15.780
I wonder where else
they got 'em.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.574
I don't think those are tattoos.

01:00:17.574 --> 01:00:19.742
I mean, like, who would want
some alphabet soup?

01:00:19.742 --> 01:00:22.787
I'd rather have
a dragon or some--

01:00:22.787 --> 01:00:26.207
somethin' more
Aquarian related, you dig?

01:00:26.207 --> 01:00:27.417
They're prisoner stamps.

01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:29.043
- [Rebecca] Mine.
- Prisoner, my ass.

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:30.920
That's exactly what
they want us to think.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.549
Or better yet, that isn't what
they want us to think.

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:38.219
That way, we'll think
what they think we might think.

01:00:38.219 --> 01:00:39.554
But actually--

01:00:39.554 --> 01:00:40.763
- [male] Booga.
- Huh?

01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:41.931
Try not to speak.

01:00:44.434 --> 01:00:46.603
How much did they pay you
to spy on us?

01:00:46.603 --> 01:00:48.521
$2.15.

01:00:48.521 --> 01:00:49.731
[male]
Shut up!

01:00:51.107 --> 01:00:52.567
[male #2] You should go easy
on the truth serum.

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:53.943
It might send 'em off.

01:00:56.154 --> 01:00:57.196
Hey.

01:00:58.823 --> 01:01:01.284
On second thought,
that could be to our advantage.

01:01:01.284 --> 01:01:03.995
That's good, I'm tired of asking
them questions anyway.

01:01:03.995 --> 01:01:06.247
- I say we kill 'em.
- I say we hump 'em.

01:01:06.247 --> 01:01:08.374
I say we get crumpets and tea.

01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:10.376
Tasty.
Crumpets and tea.

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:12.462
All in favor of crumpets
and tea, say "aye."

01:01:12.462 --> 01:01:13.504
[all]
Ave.

01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:15.673
Shut up! Ain't gonna be
no crumpets and tea.

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:17.967
We're gonna take 'em outside
right now and waste 'em.

01:01:17.967 --> 01:01:21.095
I think they're nice.
I-- I say we let 'em go.

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:23.848
Let 'em go? They're spies!
I'm gonna kill 'em myself.

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:25.099
- Wait.
- Whoa!

01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:28.269
Now, I don't remember anybody
puttin' you in charge, T-Saint.

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:30.438
- [grunts]
- Yeah, he's right.

01:01:30.438 --> 01:01:32.148
We're a committee now.
We'll vote on it.

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:36.736
Dig, all in favor of killin' 'em,
raise your tail.

01:01:40.573 --> 01:01:44.494
And all those in favor
of not killin' 'em...

01:01:46.996 --> 01:01:49.707
- Gentlemen, it's a tie.
- Coin toss time.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.919
This is pathetic.

01:01:54.295 --> 01:01:55.546
[Rebecca]
Hey, no cheating.

01:01:55.546 --> 01:01:57.423
Ready, one, two...
[giggling]

01:01:57.423 --> 01:01:58.675
[Jet Girl]
I've got you.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.054
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:02:06.015 --> 01:02:10.144
Do you suppose me and Jet
could go to the bathroom?

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:14.273
Uh, it's totally negatory.

01:02:21.489 --> 01:02:24.200
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:02:24.909 --> 01:02:29.664
You know, me and Jet
can make it worth your while.

01:02:29.664 --> 01:02:32.583
Put a little smile
on that kangaroo face.

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:44.595
You got baseball cards?

01:02:46.556 --> 01:02:48.891
[chuckles]
Oh, but-- no.

01:02:48.891 --> 01:02:51.394
But, um, I-- I know where
I could get you some.

01:02:51.394 --> 01:02:52.687
She does.

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:55.523
It's totally negatory.

01:02:55.523 --> 01:02:59.277
No, wait, wait, wait, uh, uh--
come on.

01:02:59.277 --> 01:03:01.612
Now, you don't want to be like
those other manimals in there.

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:03.823
[chuckles]
We're not manimals.

01:03:03.823 --> 01:03:04.907
What are you?

01:03:06.284 --> 01:03:09.412
The army wanted to build
the ultimate soldier,

01:03:09.412 --> 01:03:13.166
so they messed with, uh,
kangaroo NDA and--

01:03:13.166 --> 01:03:14.625
You mean DNA.

01:03:15.543 --> 01:03:17.378
Yeah.

01:03:17.378 --> 01:03:20.590
And they created us.

01:03:21.299 --> 01:03:26.095
And then the war ended
and they told Johnny to poison us.

01:03:26.095 --> 01:03:27.305
Johnny Prophet?

01:03:27.889 --> 01:03:29.056
Yeah.

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:30.433
Why?

01:03:30.433 --> 01:03:33.227
Because he was
the one that made us.

01:03:35.563 --> 01:03:39.066
But then he didn't do it because
he decided that he liked us too much.

01:03:39.734 --> 01:03:41.319
I have this great idea.

01:03:41.319 --> 01:03:45.573
You, me, and Jet go for a visit
with Johnny Prophet.

01:03:45.573 --> 01:03:46.991
Well, when he get's back, yeah.

01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:49.243
Uh, well, maybe.

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:51.370
Where did he go?

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:53.748
To, uh, uh, New Zealand

01:03:53.748 --> 01:03:57.668
for a little while to, uh,
help some scientist guy

01:03:57.668 --> 01:03:59.879
who's makin' sea water
so you could drink it.

01:03:59.879 --> 01:04:01.464
Does she need to know that?

01:04:01.464 --> 01:04:02.840
Did they need to know that?

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.218
- Uh, I was just--
- Get your ass outta here!

01:04:05.218 --> 01:04:06.302
Uh!

01:04:06.302 --> 01:04:08.805
[mixed voices]

01:04:10.932 --> 01:04:13.100
[male on radio]
Go ahead WP-2.

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.101
Hey, you guys, hey!

01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:15.728
We have a shipment coming tonight
from Red Sands, over.

01:04:15.728 --> 01:04:17.230
Water and Power's gettin' some
kind of shipment in.

01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:18.523
What kind of shipment?

01:04:18.523 --> 01:04:20.817
I don't know, all I know
it's coming in from Red Sands.

01:04:20.817 --> 01:04:23.027
- When?
- Tonight.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:25.154
What if it's a arms shipment?

01:04:25.154 --> 01:04:26.489
It's a trap.

01:04:26.656 --> 01:04:30.117
What if they want us to think
it's a trap, but it's really not?

01:04:30.117 --> 01:04:33.371
That way, when we get there,
it could still be one.

01:04:33.371 --> 01:04:36.207
[gasps]
Or better yet, what if--

01:04:36.207 --> 01:04:37.542
- Booga!
- Huh?

01:04:37.542 --> 01:04:40.419
Why don't you make yourself useful
and go and choke on something.

01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:43.297
[grumbling]
[male] Oh, that's cold, man.

01:04:44.173 --> 01:04:45.216
[Clunk]

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:51.931
Okay, we're gonna give you chicks
a chance to prove yourself.

01:04:51.931 --> 01:04:54.600
Call it an initiation.

01:04:55.518 --> 01:04:58.229
You fail, you die.

01:04:58.229 --> 01:05:00.565
Yeah, but first
you gotta strip.

01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:03.776
That's not in the plan.

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:05.403
[all]
why not?

01:05:05.403 --> 01:05:06.737
[Rebecca]
Ha ha ha.

01:05:12.994 --> 01:05:16.163
[Rebecca humming]

01:05:17.582 --> 01:05:19.458
Hold on, cats.

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:21.419
All right.

01:05:21.419 --> 01:05:26.173
All you have to do
is confirm the shipment.

01:05:26.173 --> 01:05:27.884
Copacetic?

01:05:27.884 --> 01:05:29.302
You're gonna use this.

01:05:29.302 --> 01:05:30.970
But you have to be
really careful with it.

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:32.430
- [Rebecca] Let me see.
- Because I designed it with a--

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:35.391
I, uh-- I especially built it

01:05:35.391 --> 01:05:37.184
with a visual send processor.

01:05:37.184 --> 01:05:41.022
It's a little invention that I
invented myself, I might add.

01:05:41.022 --> 01:05:42.398
- [chuckles]
- Smile.

01:05:42.398 --> 01:05:44.358
Oh, and these are so
you can hear us.

01:05:44.358 --> 01:05:45.484
This one's for you.

01:05:46.694 --> 01:05:50.531
And this one I made
especially for you.

01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:51.574
- Hmm.
- Let me help you put it on

01:05:51.574 --> 01:05:54.368
because it's kind of tricky to--
Oh, I'm sorry, how clumsy of me.

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:56.203
- Ohh.
- What?

01:05:56.203 --> 01:05:57.580
- [Jet Girl] Get off.
- It was hard to clip on.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.623
Whaa...

01:05:58.623 --> 01:06:01.459
Okay, so, we can hear you.

01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:03.920
But how are you gonna hear us?

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.755
Just speak facin' West.

01:06:05.755 --> 01:06:07.256
We'll hear you all right.

01:06:08.341 --> 01:06:12.887
The code will be, "On the road."
Yeah.

01:06:12.887 --> 01:06:14.764
He's Jack Kerouac incarnated.

01:06:14.764 --> 01:06:17.808
Uh, we-- we're all reincarnated.

01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:20.811
That means you're not really dead
or you just think you're dead--

01:06:20.811 --> 01:06:22.438
Who'd you used to be?

01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:23.773
A cop.

01:06:23.773 --> 01:06:24.982
Figures.

01:06:25.942 --> 01:06:27.735
[growls]

01:06:27.735 --> 01:06:30.696
I used to be Ted Smith,
assistant manager

01:06:30.696 --> 01:06:33.157
at Chief Auto Parts
in Cincinnati, Ohio.

01:06:33.157 --> 01:06:35.534
- Oh, fascinating.
- Oh, thank you. [chuckles]

01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:38.788
I was a dog, but because
I was really good,

01:06:38.788 --> 01:06:42.541
they, uh, moved me up
to human being status.

01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:44.168
Uh, sort of.

01:07:15.658 --> 01:07:16.826
[bonk
Uh!

01:07:17.994 --> 01:07:19.161
Strike.

01:07:26.419 --> 01:07:28.671
[men's voices]

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:34.051
North, wait--
South, West.

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:37.304
Mr. Kerouac,
I'm sending you an image.

01:07:41.726 --> 01:07:42.768
[snap]

01:07:42.768 --> 01:07:44.228
Oh, he-- here it comes.

01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:46.731
[Rebecca whispering] This is
the south side of the warehouse.

01:07:49.191 --> 01:07:51.569
- [Kerouac] Hey, hey, hey.
- [Smith] That's gotta be it.

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:53.654
- Let's move!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07:53.654 --> 01:07:56.449
All I see is a couple of workers
unloading some crates.

01:07:56.449 --> 01:07:58.367
For all you know,
that could be toilet paper.

01:07:58.367 --> 01:08:00.828
I don't see no Water and Power
vehicles out there.

01:08:00.828 --> 01:08:02.955
Tell you the truth,
I don't see jack shit.

01:08:02.955 --> 01:08:04.123
We need more proof.

01:08:04.123 --> 01:08:05.791
Yeah, I'll give you more proof.

01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:09.628
[Zipping]
I've got your proof.

01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:11.797
- Whoops, there it is.
- Oh, my.

01:08:11.797 --> 01:08:13.132
Tasty.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.598
[Rebecca]
Damn it.

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:25.978
We gotta get in closer if we're
gonna take pictures of those weapons.

01:08:25.978 --> 01:08:27.354
What are you doing?

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:29.689
Those guys'll mangle you.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.234
Jet, they're men.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:35.988
Move it or lose it.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:43.203
- Whoop
- Ooh!

01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:47.082
- Becca.
- Mm, mm, mm, mm.

01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:48.084
What's this for?

01:08:51.754 --> 01:08:52.921
Work with me, girl.

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:54.924
What do you mean,
work with you?

01:08:54.924 --> 01:08:57.134
[scoffs]
What are you doing?

01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:01.138
Uh, fabulous.

01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:04.892
I have died and gone
to hard body heaven.

01:09:04.892 --> 01:09:06.727
Shaniqua, don't dally.

01:09:07.895 --> 01:09:10.564
You are giving me realness.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:15.069
Delfrieda, darling, be a good little
girl and let's get set up.

01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:17.154
Over there by the crates.

01:09:18.697 --> 01:09:20.198
Take off your shirt.

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:23.661
What are you doing here?
This is a restricted area.

01:09:23.661 --> 01:09:25.871
I know you're not talking
to me like this.

01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:28.249
- Obviously, you didn't get the memo.
- What memo?

01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:33.379
Darling, we are doing a men
of Water and Power calendar.

01:09:33.379 --> 01:09:36.423
- Oh.
- And I think you would be

01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:39.468
the perfect supermodel cover.

01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:40.469
Oh.

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:44.430
You mean, we get
to be calendar guys?

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:45.808
Can I be December?

01:09:45.808 --> 01:09:47.560
Baby, you can be
any month you want.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.602
Yeah!

01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:52.231
LeJeanne, have we left ourselves
in our purse?

01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:54.274
- Shoot the men near the crates.
- Uh!

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:56.777
It's more... manly.

01:09:57.945 --> 01:09:59.113
Quickly.

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:02.825
Come on, get up,
get up, come on.

01:10:02.825 --> 01:10:06.537
- All right, here we go, okay.
- [Rebecca] Oh, my goodness.

01:10:06.537 --> 01:10:10.291
You are so beautiful,
you're making me sick.

01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:11.834
Smile for me.

01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:12.960
Yes!

01:10:14.837 --> 01:10:16.046
Yes.

01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:18.632
[mixed men's voices]

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.053
What's this?

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:24.263
I don't know.

01:10:24.263 --> 01:10:26.265
Let me see you--
open your shirt.

01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:28.809
Quick, quick, all right, now smile,
let me see those teeth.

01:10:28.809 --> 01:10:32.521
Come on, okay, yes, yes,
yes, I like that.

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:37.026
Those are definitely weapons
in those crates.

01:10:37.026 --> 01:10:38.194
We better move.

01:10:38.194 --> 01:10:41.197
No way, the whole thing
is so convenient, man.

01:10:41.197 --> 01:10:42.323
If they wanna be down with us,

01:10:42.323 --> 01:10:44.491
tell 'em to hijack
the shipment themself.

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:46.660
If they pull it off,
then we'll think about it.

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.412
Fine, I'll have the goods
to you in an hour.

01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:49.622
Asshole.

01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:53.751
Oh!

01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:56.545
The glamour has left
the building.

01:10:56.545 --> 01:11:00.841
There's no magic, there's no sparkle,
there's no je ne sais quoi.

01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:02.176
Come, Jetina.

01:11:02.176 --> 01:11:06.055
Hold your chest,
come on, brilliant, that's great.

01:11:06.764 --> 01:11:08.098
Jetina, come.

01:11:08.098 --> 01:11:10.017
[Jet Girl]
Oh, God, that's great!

01:11:10.017 --> 01:11:13.437
Yes, you're so brilliant,
you're a supermodel--

01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:15.856
The super has left
the model, girl.

01:11:15.856 --> 01:11:16.982
Come on.

01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:18.651
So, when's the calendar
comin' out?

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.805
Mmm, let's go!

01:11:48.889 --> 01:11:50.266
Turbo boosters.

01:11:51.475 --> 01:11:53.185
Ba-dah!

01:11:55.145 --> 01:11:56.397
What the hell?

01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:03.404
[shouting]

01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:07.992
Suck on this, dirtbag!

01:12:08.784 --> 01:12:11.203
And keep your ass
out of the fast lane!

01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:16.417
Damn!

01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:19.378
Jet, what are
you wearin' tonight?

01:12:20.462 --> 01:12:22.298
Jetness, remember me?

01:12:22.298 --> 01:12:24.758
Hijacking shipment, me, you.

01:12:24.758 --> 01:12:25.884
Jet, hello.

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:30.806
Shit, I've got a malfunction.

01:12:30.806 --> 01:12:33.767
Well fix it fast and get
your narrow little butt over here.

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:35.936
I wouldn't want you
to miss all this fun.

01:12:41.317 --> 01:12:43.569
Do you mind?
I'm tryin' to have a little lunch.

01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:49.742
Oh, now you're workin' my tits.

01:12:51.035 --> 01:12:53.454
You guys can't shoot
worth a shit.

01:12:53.662 --> 01:12:56.915
- Uh!
- Ha, hey oh, ha, ha, ha!

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:22.775
Damn, where is she?

01:13:27.112 --> 01:13:29.031
Road kill.
[giggles]

01:13:30.866 --> 01:13:33.285
I'm too young for this shit.
[whistles]

01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:43.796
Hey, I guess we got rid
of her, huh? [chuckles]

01:13:46.507 --> 01:13:47.549
[male]
Jack!

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:49.968
- Uh, uh!
- Hi.

01:13:49.968 --> 01:13:53.722
Ha, ha. [giggles]
Feeling a little inadequate?

01:13:54.598 --> 01:13:56.642
- I'm out of here.
- Go!

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:24.086
Hey, girl,
glad you could join me.

01:14:24.086 --> 01:14:25.546
I'm in the semi

01:14:25.546 --> 01:14:27.256
and I got the goods.

01:14:27.423 --> 01:14:29.967
[Jet Girl]
Rebecca, can you hear me?

01:14:30.509 --> 01:14:32.219
There's a big cliff
coming up on you.

01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:33.470
Now, hit the breaks.

01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:37.224
Hit the brakes!

01:14:37.224 --> 01:14:39.726
Oh, brakes aren't
working girl, plan B.

01:14:39.726 --> 01:14:41.353
Get out of there quick.
Jump!

01:14:41.353 --> 01:14:42.604
Aw, shit!

01:15:00.789 --> 01:15:01.790
Ah!

01:15:19.808 --> 01:15:21.268
[yells]

01:15:23.187 --> 01:15:25.564
Rebecca!

01:15:25.939 --> 01:15:27.065
Grab on.

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:37.242
I came as fast as I could.

01:15:37.242 --> 01:15:38.869
I know you probably
didn't need help.

01:15:38.869 --> 01:15:40.787
But I got here
as fast as I could.

01:15:41.997 --> 01:15:44.500
I had it all under control, Booga.

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:47.836
[male chuckling]
That squash is really good.

01:15:47.836 --> 01:15:51.507
A toast to our newest members.

01:15:51.507 --> 01:15:55.427
May their energies enhance
the spirit of our circle.

01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:57.721
[all cheering]
Yeah. Here, here.

01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:02.059
Ahhh, great.
Now, let's check out the weapons.

01:16:02.059 --> 01:16:05.270
After the ceremony,
the weapons'll be disposed of.

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:07.940
Why?
After all that?

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:11.818
Uh, we don't use guns.

01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:13.070
Uh-huh.

01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:14.321
You don't use guns?

01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:17.533
No, Prophet taught us to fight
without the corruption of guns.

01:16:17.533 --> 01:16:20.244
- Yeah.
- Let us all hold hands.

01:16:20.244 --> 01:16:21.453
[male]
Oh, great.

01:16:22.246 --> 01:16:23.330
Please.

01:16:29.545 --> 01:16:32.464
I'd like to recite a poem
that I've written.

01:16:32.464 --> 01:16:33.674
Oh, cool.

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:39.972
[soulful jazz playing]

01:16:42.891 --> 01:16:45.894
Laugh, you butterfly

01:16:45.894 --> 01:16:49.064
that dances in the mud.

01:16:49.064 --> 01:16:53.068
Laugh, you piece
of dental floss.

01:16:53.068 --> 01:16:57.072
- You burn me toast.
- Yeah.

01:16:57.072 --> 01:16:59.992
[plays soulfully]

01:17:04.246 --> 01:17:08.959
Laugh, you pig
that flies in the sky

01:17:08.959 --> 01:17:12.879
with rainbow Twinkie fluid

01:17:12.879 --> 01:17:18.176
and three liters
of high-octane petrol.

01:17:18.176 --> 01:17:19.303
<i>[whispers]
Oh, yeah.</i>

01:17:19.303 --> 01:17:21.305
[plays more discordantly]

01:17:23.765 --> 01:17:26.143
- Whew.
- Yeah, heh, heh.

01:17:26.143 --> 01:17:27.311
- Bravo.
- Yes, sir.

01:17:28.979 --> 01:17:30.772
Hit it again.

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.400
Thank you.

01:17:34.693 --> 01:17:37.613
NOW, let's Pray-

01:17:45.162 --> 01:17:47.581
[rhythmic drums beating]

01:17:56.632 --> 01:17:59.843
[Chanting]
Uh! Uh!

01:18:10.228 --> 01:18:11.521
[Rebecca]
Come on, Jet.

01:18:16.652 --> 01:18:19.279
Here we go...

01:18:21.406 --> 01:18:22.824
What are you doing?

01:18:22.824 --> 01:18:25.661
We're praying
to the spirit of freedom.

01:18:26.662 --> 01:18:28.538
Prophet taught us religion.

01:18:28.538 --> 01:18:30.666
Hallelujah!

01:18:31.041 --> 01:18:32.250
Damn right.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:34.294
- Come on.
- Oh, no, I can't, I'm not good at--

01:18:34.294 --> 01:18:35.545
It's okay, I have condoms.

01:18:41.802 --> 01:18:42.969
Yay, Jet!

01:18:47.265 --> 01:18:48.600
Booga, where'd
you learn to dance?

01:19:11.039 --> 01:19:13.583
[laughing]

01:19:18.505 --> 01:19:21.675
Oh, wow.

01:19:22.676 --> 01:19:25.429
It's one of Johnny Prophet's
dreams.

01:19:26.805 --> 01:19:29.933
See how the people
are all free

01:19:29.933 --> 01:19:34.312
and the water just
comes down from the sky

01:19:34.312 --> 01:19:36.106
and it don't cost nothin'.

01:19:37.566 --> 01:19:41.737
With flowers and rainbows.

01:19:44.448 --> 01:19:46.491
- [sighs]
- It's beautiful.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.419
[chuckling] This is just
like Christmas, isn't it?

01:19:57.419 --> 01:19:59.755
- Mm-hm.
- I love opening things.

01:19:59.755 --> 01:20:01.506
Especially when
you don't know what's inside.

01:20:01.506 --> 01:20:04.760
I remember the first Christmas
I got to open something.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.887
- Mm-hm.
- It was a book.

01:20:06.887 --> 01:20:09.848
I didn't know what the title was
'cause the cover was ripped off.

01:20:09.848 --> 01:20:13.226
But it had these
really cool pictures--

01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:16.646
- Booga!
- Okay, okay, I'm done.

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:17.689
Let's get this one.

01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:19.399
- [Rebecca giggles]
- Two, three.

01:20:23.528 --> 01:20:26.072
It's dirt.
This is bullshit.

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:27.324
We've been had.

01:20:27.324 --> 01:20:28.617
Good job.

01:20:28.617 --> 01:20:30.410
Come on, help me open
this one over here.

01:20:31.745 --> 01:20:34.122
One, two, three.

01:20:37.793 --> 01:20:39.211
Jesus Christ.

01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:44.174
Johnny Prophet.

01:20:44.174 --> 01:20:46.176
Motherfucker Kesslee
killed Prophet!

01:20:49.429 --> 01:20:52.599
[howling]

01:21:00.607 --> 01:21:02.317
[growling]

01:21:05.529 --> 01:21:08.240
[laughing]

01:21:11.993 --> 01:21:14.663
[Jet Girl]
Okay guys, here's the plan.

01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:20.460
Water and Power has mines
all the way from here to here.

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:21.962
No, there's no way through 'em.

01:21:22.963 --> 01:21:24.589
How 'bout we go over 'em?

01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:25.632
Yeah, that's great.

01:21:25.632 --> 01:21:27.259
How you plan
on sneakin' over the top?

01:21:27.259 --> 01:21:29.177
- Fly?
- Yep.

01:21:29.177 --> 01:21:30.512
We've got the stolen flyer.

01:21:30.512 --> 01:21:34.641
All we have to do is paint it back
the way it was and pow.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.935
What happens when they ask
for a security code?

01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:38.520
- Then what, huh?
- Yeah, then what?

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.523
Well, uh,
maybe we could, uh, wait

01:21:41.523 --> 01:21:43.316
till another flyer does
a routine scout.

01:21:43.316 --> 01:21:45.360
We capture his ID code
and we're in.

01:21:45.777 --> 01:21:49.447
Brilliant.
Okay, I will meet you there.

01:21:49.447 --> 01:21:51.658
Wait, what do you mean
meet us there?

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:54.411
I'm not goin' in
without my tank.

01:21:54.411 --> 01:21:55.829
- Gentlemen.
- Let's go.

01:21:55.829 --> 01:21:57.581
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:21:57.581 --> 01:21:59.040
We're listenin' to her now?

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.709
I thought we were committee.
We gotta vote.

01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:01.793
Okay-

01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:04.212
Everybody for that pathetic plan,
raise your paw.

01:22:04.212 --> 01:22:05.338
Majority, let's go-

01:22:05.338 --> 01:22:07.549
All right, let's hit it.
[mixed voices]

01:22:09.426 --> 01:22:11.261
Committee.
[spits]

01:22:34.242 --> 01:22:36.620
[male on radio] Condor zero four,
respond when airborne.

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:38.872
Okay, okay,
I got us an ID code.

01:22:38.872 --> 01:22:41.207
- Cool.
- You are just too cool.

01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:43.460
All right,
now, try to sound relaxed.

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:46.296
And whatever you do,
only repeat what I tell you.

01:22:46.296 --> 01:22:47.339
- Got it?
- Yeah.

01:22:47.339 --> 01:22:48.340
Okay-

01:22:49.341 --> 01:22:52.427
Condor Control,
this is Condor zero four, over.

01:22:52.427 --> 01:22:54.346
- What did she say?
- Okay.

01:22:54.346 --> 01:22:59.976
Condor Control, Condo, um, I mean,
um, Condor four, come in, over.

01:22:59.976 --> 01:23:02.562
Condor four,
we just sent you out.

01:23:02.562 --> 01:23:04.814
You must have a stabilizer
in your left modifier.

01:23:04.814 --> 01:23:06.358
- Okay.
- Come on, go ahead.

01:23:06.358 --> 01:23:09.736
Must be a, um, stabilizer in the left,
in the modifier.

01:23:09.736 --> 01:23:13.031
Condor four, why aren't you using
your assigned frequency?

01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.866
- Must be a short haircut.
- What?

01:23:14.866 --> 01:23:15.909
- No!
- Ow.

01:23:15.909 --> 01:23:17.577
- Uhhh.
- [Jet Girl] Short circuit.

01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:19.955
Yeeah!

01:23:21.998 --> 01:23:23.792
Whoa! Aah!

01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:26.670
Get 'em!

01:23:46.314 --> 01:23:47.983
[male] Just repeat
what she tells you.

01:23:47.983 --> 01:23:49.025
[Jet Girl]
You're blowing it!

01:23:49.025 --> 01:23:50.402
Say again, zero four.

01:23:50.402 --> 01:23:51.945
You're blowing it, Donner,
just listen to me okay?

01:23:51.945 --> 01:23:53.613
- No!
- We're dead.

01:23:53.613 --> 01:23:54.698
We're dead.

01:23:54.698 --> 01:23:56.992
Condor zero four,
you said you're dead?

01:23:56.992 --> 01:23:58.076
All right, that's it.

01:23:58.076 --> 01:24:00.328
Turn this boat around
or you're gonna get us all killed.

01:24:00.328 --> 01:24:01.788
Now! Do it now!

01:24:01.788 --> 01:24:03.832
No!
We're going in!

01:24:03.832 --> 01:24:04.833
You are gonna listen to me.

01:24:04.833 --> 01:24:07.335
For once, you're gonna shut
your deformed face

01:24:07.335 --> 01:24:09.087
and you're gonna let me
do my stuff!

01:24:09.087 --> 01:24:10.046
Have you got that?

01:24:11.172 --> 01:24:12.340
All right.

01:24:13.258 --> 01:24:15.301
Home plate,
this is Condor four.

01:24:15.301 --> 01:24:16.928
We have pirate interference.

01:24:16.928 --> 01:24:18.930
Obviously, a Ripper ploy
to confuse you.

01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:20.390
Now, here's the situation--

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:22.434
This bird has got no electrical

01:24:22.434 --> 01:24:24.519
and in about two minutes,
we're gonna be kissing gravel.

01:24:24.519 --> 01:24:26.312
So, listen to me,
you spam sucker.

01:24:26.312 --> 01:24:28.440
Either you get off your butt
and clear us for landing,

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.109
or I'm going to fly this rocket
right up your socket!

01:24:36.823 --> 01:24:38.950
Uh, roger, zero four,
you're cleared for hangar A.

01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:41.870
- Cool.
- Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

01:24:43.329 --> 01:24:45.498
[beeping]

01:24:51.713 --> 01:24:54.466
'Bout time.
[laughing]

01:24:55.884 --> 01:24:56.926
[crackling]
Damn.

01:25:00.555 --> 01:25:02.057
[shouting]

01:25:14.152 --> 01:25:16.071
Yeeah!

01:25:18.156 --> 01:25:19.407
[coughing]

01:25:19.407 --> 01:25:21.701
[clamoring]

01:25:40.428 --> 01:25:42.388
[Kesslee]
Start the water.

01:25:49.813 --> 01:25:53.775
Shoving a small,
innocent child down the pipe

01:25:54.109 --> 01:25:57.445
and then slowly
letting her drown.

01:25:58.655 --> 01:26:01.241
Is that wrong?
[laughs]

01:26:03.159 --> 01:26:04.494
[man]
Move out!

01:26:08.373 --> 01:26:09.707
Looks all clear.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.252
Let's go, daddy-o.

01:26:14.254 --> 01:26:16.923
- Did you hear that?
- What? I don't hear anything.

01:26:16.923 --> 01:26:19.175
Shh! Must be 150 of them.

01:26:19.175 --> 01:26:22.637
Hundred and sixty-three.
We're toast.

01:26:22.637 --> 01:26:24.472
Actually, 164.

01:26:24.848 --> 01:26:26.641
Definitely.

01:26:26.641 --> 01:26:28.059
Rebecca.

01:26:28.059 --> 01:26:29.018
Are you okay?

01:26:30.562 --> 01:26:32.188
Ohhh.

01:26:35.275 --> 01:26:37.652
[Rebecca]
Okay, come on, come on.

01:26:44.701 --> 01:26:45.827
Go on.

01:26:45.827 --> 01:26:47.287
GO, go! go, go-

01:26:50.456 --> 01:26:51.499
No!

01:26:55.837 --> 01:26:58.047
You see that light down there?

01:26:58.047 --> 01:27:00.508
Light is not our bag.

01:27:00.508 --> 01:27:03.970
Yeah, we're much better in the dark
like Count Chocula.

01:27:03.970 --> 01:27:05.680
Dracula, fool.

01:27:06.139 --> 01:27:08.850
Count Chocula is the guy
on the laundry detergent box.

01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:10.101
Duhh!

01:27:10.101 --> 01:27:12.854
- If I asked you something--
- No, he is-- he's right.

01:27:12.854 --> 01:27:15.273
- [clamoring]
- Shut up.

01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:16.691
Thank you.

01:27:16.691 --> 01:27:18.776
Could we just figure out
what we're gonna do, please?

01:27:18.776 --> 01:27:21.779
Well, there are power boxes down
at the end of this aisle.

01:27:21.779 --> 01:27:23.031
If only we could get to them.

01:27:23.031 --> 01:27:24.574
Later, cats.

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.534
No!

01:27:31.122 --> 01:27:32.457
Sir, we've got action.

01:27:32.957 --> 01:27:35.543
Let's get this over with quickly,
Sergeant.

01:27:35.877 --> 01:27:37.086
[male]
There he is!

01:27:38.004 --> 01:27:40.131
[shouting]

01:27:45.136 --> 01:27:46.638
Uh!

01:27:52.268 --> 01:27:53.811
Hang on a second,
we've lost power.

01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:55.688
What the hell happened
to the lights?

01:28:00.151 --> 01:28:01.486
[yelling]

01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:07.075
Guard!
Watch our back.

01:28:07.825 --> 01:28:12.038
- Oh, no, Deet?
- Deetee, come on, man.

01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:16.459
Deetee?

01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:19.796
Hold on, man,
hold on.

01:28:20.797 --> 01:28:22.006
Deetee!

01:28:23.633 --> 01:28:25.009
Oh, my God.

01:28:25.885 --> 01:28:27.011
No.

01:28:27.011 --> 01:28:31.266
I'll see you cats
at that big jam in the sky.

01:28:34.227 --> 01:28:36.396
Oh, no, no.

01:28:36.396 --> 01:28:38.273
No.

01:28:38.273 --> 01:28:40.275
[growling]

01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:49.784
[roaring and howling]

01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:36.914
Help.

01:29:38.374 --> 01:29:41.669
[Sam]
Rebecca, help.

01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:43.379
Hang on, I hear you!

01:29:44.339 --> 01:29:46.090
Can't breathe.

01:29:46.632 --> 01:29:50.595
[gasping]
Please, help me.

01:29:55.808 --> 01:29:57.393
[Sam's voice]
I can't breathe.

01:29:58.686 --> 01:30:01.356
Please help me.

01:30:02.565 --> 01:30:04.150
[Kesslee]
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:07.820
If you're looking for Sam,
she's in the pipe!

01:30:13.076 --> 01:30:15.912
What, again?
Piece of shit.

01:30:15.912 --> 01:30:17.914
Now, there's something
about you that's different.

01:30:17.914 --> 01:30:19.540
I think it--
[groans]

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.709
I'll tell you what's different.
I've lost my patience.

01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:23.795
And you've lost the fight.

01:30:31.636 --> 01:30:34.263
Oh, I played Yo"-

01:30:34.263 --> 01:30:37.767
I played you
like an old fiddle.

01:30:38.017 --> 01:30:40.353
[Jet Girl's voice]
Well, uh, maybe we could, uh,

01:30:40.353 --> 01:30:42.814
wait till another flyer does
a routine scout.

01:30:42.814 --> 01:30:44.816
We capture his ID code
and we're in.

01:30:45.191 --> 01:30:46.234
Brilliant.

01:30:46.234 --> 01:30:47.568
Jet.

01:30:47.568 --> 01:30:50.113
She's been workin'
for you this whole time.

01:30:50.113 --> 01:30:52.073
No, you were.

01:30:52.073 --> 01:30:55.535
You're a walking, talking,
living microphone.

01:30:55.535 --> 01:30:58.371
I had them planted
all over your body.

01:30:59.789 --> 01:31:02.458
Thank you for serving up
the Rippers.

01:31:02.959 --> 01:31:04.210
[chuckles]

01:31:04.544 --> 01:31:05.586
Uh!

01:31:05.586 --> 01:31:08.256
They'll make great shoe leather
for my soldiers.

01:31:18.433 --> 01:31:19.684
[yelling]

01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:23.980
Uh!

01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:27.859
[laughing]

01:31:28.776 --> 01:31:30.027
Need a hand?

01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:32.196
- [beeping]
- Come on, get UP-

01:31:32.196 --> 01:31:35.199
- What happened?
- Oh, I'm so pretty.

01:31:35.199 --> 01:31:39.454
I'm gonna hit you so hard
you're children will be born bruised.

01:31:39.454 --> 01:31:40.872
Get up!

01:31:40.872 --> 01:31:42.331
P-P-P-P-p-pow.

01:31:45.334 --> 01:31:46.377
Uh!

01:31:53.426 --> 01:31:56.387
Marvelous, isn't it?
[chuckles]

01:31:56.387 --> 01:31:59.515
State of the art
holographic technology.

01:31:59.515 --> 01:32:02.226
Mm.
[chuckles]

01:32:02.226 --> 01:32:03.436
You know what it means?

01:32:03.936 --> 01:32:07.315
It means I can hurt you,
but you can't hurt me.

01:32:07.315 --> 01:32:08.524
[yells]

01:32:21.829 --> 01:32:23.164
[laughs]

01:32:45.645 --> 01:32:47.688
I won and you know it.

01:32:48.523 --> 01:32:51.275
Come on.
Say it, say it.

01:32:51.275 --> 01:32:54.320
Just say I won.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:57.448
- I won.
- No! No!

01:32:57.448 --> 01:32:59.033
Say I won!

01:32:59.033 --> 01:33:00.326
I won.

01:33:03.496 --> 01:33:06.791
Hmm, say it.

01:33:07.375 --> 01:33:09.919
And the little girl lives.

01:33:11.837 --> 01:33:14.799
I'd rather her die
than live as your slave.

01:33:15.591 --> 01:33:16.842
Uh!

01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:31.023
[yells]

01:33:32.108 --> 01:33:33.901
What took you so long?

01:33:34.318 --> 01:33:36.362
[yelling]

01:33:36.612 --> 01:33:38.322
Well, well, well.

01:33:38.781 --> 01:33:40.616
[bell dinging]

01:33:41.784 --> 01:33:43.119

What's the matter with you?

01:33:53.296 --> 01:33:54.255
Finish him!

01:33:58.884 --> 01:34:01.512
Aw, shit.
Don't tell me you're out of ammo.

01:34:03.973 --> 01:34:05.808
Don't move a muscle.

01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:07.143

01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:14.400

Thirsty?

Try this close
to your heart, asshole!

01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:16.188
Did I hurt you yet?

01:36:16.188 --> 01:36:19.442

Fuck me.

01:36:59.273 --> 01:37:01.942
How many times

01:37:01.942 --> 01:37:04.862
I don't want to.

01:37:10.451 --> 01:37:12.119
[panting]

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.996
It's over.

01:37:15.873 --> 01:37:17.082
Don't move!

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:18.918
Down!

01:37:22.588 --> 01:37:24.882
See ya in the next world.

<i>Atten-hut!</i>

01:37:29.136 --> 01:37:33.307
General, uh, we have
taken out the airfields

01:37:33.307 --> 01:37:34.975
and now have control
of the bridge.

01:37:34.975 --> 01:37:36.977
Awaiting your next command, sir.

01:37:37.436 --> 01:37:39.271
[giggles]

01:37:39.271 --> 01:37:41.857
I, uh, I took the bullets
out of their guns.

01:37:41.857 --> 01:37:43.234
Real smart, huh?

01:37:43.234 --> 01:37:44.944
Booga, that was very smart.

01:37:47.029 --> 01:37:48.781

Giggles.

01:38:08.509 --> 01:38:11.345
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:24.859 --> 01:38:27.611
[yelling]

01:38:27.611 --> 01:38:29.613

01:38:34.159 --> 01:38:35.411
Waterfall ahead!

01:38:35.411 --> 01:38:38.205
Shut up,
you'll ruin the surprise.

01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:43.919
Yeeah!

01:38:45.337 --> 01:38:46.338
<i>Ker-pow!</i>
