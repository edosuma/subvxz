WEBVTT

00:13.497 --> 00:17.401
You were gettin' caught up
with your pals the other day...

00:17.434 --> 00:20.137
DARYL: Have yous ever
heard of sober October?

00:20.170 --> 00:22.539
That's an emo band
from Hamilton?

00:22.572 --> 00:25.509
No, it's just like being sober
for the whole month of October.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.812
Oh, one month off booze ain't
gonna cleans out your livers.

00:27.845 --> 00:29.714
Might help you a wee bit
on the scale, though.

00:29.747 --> 00:30.815
Everything in moderation.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.384
You ever heard of

00:34.418 --> 00:36.520
‐no nut November?
‐What's that?

00:36.553 --> 00:40.324
Oh, I bet it's got something to
do with not nuttin' in November.

00:40.357 --> 00:43.493
Regular ejaculations decreases
your risks of prostate cancer.

00:43.527 --> 00:45.162
Oh, no, fuck.
Now we're havin' fun.

00:45.195 --> 00:46.296
It's good cardio though.

00:46.330 --> 00:47.698
Somethin' you tryna
say to me, Dary?

00:48.899 --> 00:50.935
But I was reading
about this thing called

00:50.968 --> 00:52.903
beat your dick December.

00:52.937 --> 00:55.239
Beat your dick December?
What's the rumpus grumpus?

00:56.406 --> 00:58.342
Well, you look at the calendar,

00:58.375 --> 01:01.211
and if it's like the first,
second or the third,

01:01.245 --> 01:03.447
that's how many times per day
you need to mix a batch.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.950
So, on the 20th of December, you
got to mix 20 separate batches?

01:05.983 --> 01:07.251
You got'er pontiac.

01:07.284 --> 01:08.653
There's 30 days hath September,

01:08.686 --> 01:10.755
June and November.
All rest, 31, so...

01:10.788 --> 01:13.758
So, on the 31st,
you'd have to batch 31 times?

01:13.791 --> 01:15.192
You heard it here first.

01:15.225 --> 01:16.426
How's he gonna fuck that pig?

01:16.460 --> 01:17.494
Well...

01:18.829 --> 01:21.531
From the 1st to the 5th,
you're having a good time.

01:21.565 --> 01:23.934
And even up until the 10th.

01:23.968 --> 01:26.804
The 12th, you're
starting to fade.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.873
And by the 15th, you're
definitely not full bars.

01:28.906 --> 01:31.275
Oh, I don't think I could
continue past the 15th.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.342
Yeah, me neither.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.513
Wayne?

01:38.916 --> 01:40.951
Yeah.

01:40.985 --> 01:42.953
You're saying you could
batch 15 times on the 15th

01:42.987 --> 01:45.322
despite the fact that you
batched 14 times the day before,

01:45.355 --> 01:46.691
13 times the day before that

01:46.724 --> 01:48.558
and so on and so forth
back to one?

01:52.462 --> 01:53.463
Yeah.

01:55.733 --> 01:57.668
Could, could you do 20?

02:07.978 --> 02:10.014
‐Yeah.
‐Stay hydrated.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.482
What say we pick up
the conversation on the 25th?

02:12.516 --> 02:14.318
Oh, yeah, the 25th.
Christmas Day.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.420
That presents some obstacles,
what with family obligations

02:16.453 --> 02:19.389
‐or what not. You need a plan.
‐What's the plan, Dan?

02:19.423 --> 02:20.390
Please explain, Wayne.

02:20.424 --> 02:23.728
Well this, like everything,
starts with diet.

02:23.761 --> 02:24.929
What's on the menu?

02:24.962 --> 02:27.598
Oh, you'd want foods that boost
your testosterone, likely.

02:27.632 --> 02:28.999
Judging by biceps over there,

02:29.033 --> 02:30.835
I think that's already
on the menu, likely.

02:30.868 --> 02:33.503
Oatmeal, tuna, red meat,

02:34.338 --> 02:35.572
and poultry.

02:35.606 --> 02:36.807
Remember when I said
stay hydrated?

02:36.841 --> 02:38.943
A person should
always stay hydrated, Dary.

02:38.976 --> 02:40.510
How would you maneuver
around your family?

02:41.411 --> 02:42.713
Yeah. Nieces and nephews.

02:42.747 --> 02:43.781
You wouldn't.

02:45.983 --> 02:48.686
I really think
you should, Wayne.

02:48.719 --> 02:49.920
You're goin' away for Christmas.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.022
No, uh,

02:52.056 --> 02:54.524
Destination Christmas?
There has to be an alternative.

02:54.558 --> 02:56.560
‐There's no alternative.
‐What about presents?

02:56.594 --> 02:58.328
Real men finish what
they started, Dary.

02:59.730 --> 03:00.898
‐He's right.
‐So, now, the critical

03:00.931 --> 03:02.833
component in all this, I think,

03:03.433 --> 03:04.534
is sleep.

03:04.568 --> 03:05.770
I hadn't even thought of that.

03:05.803 --> 03:09.907
Well, you've hammered on it
25 times in 24 calendar hours.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.575
And, the day before,
you've hammered on it

03:11.609 --> 03:13.410
24 times in 24 calendar hours.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.079
And so on and so forth.
Back to one.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.580
Yeah, you'd need
a good night's sleep.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.048
Oh, some nappin'
in there for sure.

03:18.082 --> 03:19.884
Yeah, you'd be pretty
worn out from all that

03:19.917 --> 03:21.586
Christmas Eve hustle and bustle.

03:21.619 --> 03:23.988
So, I would suggest
getting us all 12 hours of sleep

03:24.021 --> 03:25.890
to rest and replenish,
then wake up,

03:25.923 --> 03:26.857
hammer on it twice an hour

03:26.891 --> 03:28.693
for the next 12 hours
to meet your quota.

03:28.726 --> 03:30.027
Twenty‐four times
in 12 hours is still 1 shy

03:30.060 --> 03:31.929
of your Christmas Day quota?

03:31.962 --> 03:33.030
I know.

03:33.063 --> 03:35.565
So, when'r you gonna squeeze
out your 25th squeezers?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.301
‐Dealer's choice really.
‐No.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.570
No.

03:40.605 --> 03:43.373
Not a single 12 hour effort.

03:43.407 --> 03:45.509
It's too many variables
in a window that small.

03:45.542 --> 03:46.443
Too much uncertainty.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.378
You're saying you'd use
the full 24 hours?

03:48.412 --> 03:49.780
Yeah.

03:49.814 --> 03:51.882
Yeah, we're on
military time now.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.618
‐When do you start?
‐Zero dark.

03:53.651 --> 03:54.785
But that's when Santa comes.

03:55.119 --> 03:56.320
And then?

03:57.788 --> 03:58.923
Zero dark thirty.

03:58.956 --> 03:59.990
So, you'd hammer out
the first two

04:00.024 --> 04:01.058
in the first hour you're awakes?

04:01.091 --> 04:02.627
‐Can confirm.
‐And then what?

04:02.660 --> 04:04.561
Once an hour for the
remaining 23 hours?

04:04.595 --> 04:06.563
‐You bet.
‐Holds water.

04:06.597 --> 04:08.032
‐Stay hydrated.
‐All that you wanna do

04:08.065 --> 04:09.533
is you wanna set your alarm
to wake you up

04:09.566 --> 04:10.968
every hour on the hour.

04:11.001 --> 04:14.471
And the program is, you wake up,
hammer on it, sleep,

04:14.504 --> 04:18.408
wake up, then you'd hammer
on it, then you'd sleep.

04:18.442 --> 04:19.910
And so on and so forth?

04:19.944 --> 04:21.445
Well, some snackin'
in there for sure.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.780
Yeah, handful of trail mix.

04:22.813 --> 04:24.014
You've hammered out
your first two

04:24.048 --> 04:26.016
at zero dark
and zero dark thirty.

04:26.050 --> 04:27.652
Could even back to back
those fellas if you're

04:27.685 --> 04:30.120
feeling good out of the gate.
Then, it's sheets.

04:30.154 --> 04:32.590
0100 hours, just up the road.

04:32.623 --> 04:34.091
And stay hydrated, of course.

04:34.124 --> 04:36.526
That's some snackin' in there
for sure. Need some snacks.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.728
You'd think you'd
wanna do it standing up

04:37.762 --> 04:38.896
so your muscles don't atrophy.

04:38.929 --> 04:40.731
I think if anything,
they'd hypertrophy.

04:40.765 --> 04:42.733
‐I think so too.
‐Would you alternate hands?

04:42.767 --> 04:43.801
Oh, you'd have to.

04:43.834 --> 04:45.169
25 one‐arm squeezers

04:45.202 --> 04:47.772
sounds like a lot of unnecessary
strain on the heart.

04:47.805 --> 04:49.974
Yeah, you'd definitely need a
helping hand from the other guy.

04:50.007 --> 04:51.776
And you'd stick with
that program till the 31st?

04:51.809 --> 04:55.445
Yup. Wake up.
Hammer on it. Snack. Nap.

04:55.479 --> 04:59.717
Wake up. I'd need to
hammer on it. Snack and nap.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.886
‐And so on and so forth?
‐Rinse and repeat.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.090
Have you considered
performance enhancers?

05:06.123 --> 05:07.758
The fact you'd even present that

05:07.792 --> 05:09.193
says a lot about ya, good buddy.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.996
You could just as easily
call it antisocial December.

05:16.734 --> 05:17.735
‐Wayne?
‐Dary.

05:21.171 --> 05:22.406
Could you make it to 31?

05:24.241 --> 05:27.778
Oh, if I've executed Christmas,
for a total of...

05:27.812 --> 05:31.048
Ballpark 325 squeezers
in 1 fiscal month...

05:31.081 --> 05:32.082
You're a man on fire.

05:32.116 --> 05:34.184
It's like I'm indestructible
by both scientific

05:34.218 --> 05:35.786
and pop‐culture standards.

05:35.820 --> 05:36.854
Tank‐like momentum.

05:40.891 --> 05:41.892
So?

05:46.230 --> 05:46.864
Yeah.

05:48.999 --> 05:52.002
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

07:51.689 --> 07:52.890
Holy fuck.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.625
Look at this coming.

07:59.630 --> 08:02.332
Could you be any
fuckin' louder, bud?

08:02.366 --> 08:04.068
All singin', all dancin', bud.

08:04.101 --> 08:05.102
Jaker!

08:07.738 --> 08:09.273
Hey, put some fuckin'
clothes on, cousin.

08:09.306 --> 08:10.675
Not my forte, cousin.

08:12.109 --> 08:14.779
There's that good old,
warm Canadian welcome.

08:14.812 --> 08:16.714
Well, every other country
fuckin' hates ya

08:16.747 --> 08:18.582
so we may as well give you
some love, am I right?

08:20.084 --> 08:21.218
That's what family's for.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.419
Who called you, you old devil.

08:22.452 --> 08:25.355
Need not call the devil, cousin.
He'll come all on his own.

08:25.389 --> 08:27.191
Those Westboro Baptists
teach you that ones?

08:27.224 --> 08:28.258
Squirrelly.

08:29.326 --> 08:30.560
How'd you find your way up here

08:30.595 --> 08:33.130
when you can't even point out
the country on a map, big fella?

08:33.163 --> 08:35.032
Big fella? I guess that's fair.

08:35.065 --> 08:36.667
We still got
trans‐fats stateside

08:36.701 --> 08:38.636
but they banned 'em up here
so, what's your excuse?

08:38.669 --> 08:40.705
‐Maple syrups.
‐Huh.

08:40.738 --> 08:42.139
‐Well, get up, Dary.
‐Wasn't gonna.

08:42.172 --> 08:43.974
What, you scared I'll put you
in the sharpshooter again?

08:44.008 --> 08:45.676
That was the Boston Crab
last time.

08:45.710 --> 08:48.078
A Canadian correcting
an American on wrestling moves.

08:48.112 --> 08:49.179
What a time to be alive.

08:49.213 --> 08:50.414
Sharpshooter is a Canadian move,

08:50.447 --> 08:51.682
which I've since learned
how to reverse.

08:51.716 --> 08:54.318
Hey, you may farm cattle, Dary,
but you're all chickenshit.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.755
I'd have some balls
taking one of yours

08:57.788 --> 08:59.957
when Michigan's got
the cheapest beer stateside.

08:59.990 --> 09:02.326
What kind of watered down swill
did you bring us this time?

09:02.359 --> 09:05.162
Call this one sixteen bucks.

09:05.195 --> 09:08.232
And I call this one 15.95.

09:08.265 --> 09:10.000
That is absolute horse shit.

09:10.034 --> 09:11.201
Call someone who cares, Dan.

09:11.235 --> 09:12.336
But you better use my cell phone

09:12.369 --> 09:15.439
since yous pay three times
the price for that as well.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.007
How many months have you
been back from your first tour

09:17.041 --> 09:17.908
‐Jaker?
‐Two.

09:17.942 --> 09:19.710
Let me hear you count
that high, Dary.

09:19.744 --> 09:21.378
So, are you planning
on going back then?

09:21.411 --> 09:22.880
Fuck yeah. Get some.

09:22.913 --> 09:24.348
Well, yanks love their country,

09:24.381 --> 09:26.717
so, whatcha gonna
say about yanks?

09:26.751 --> 09:27.885
So, what brings you up north?

09:27.918 --> 09:30.755
Well, what do you do when
your cousint's down in a hole?

09:30.788 --> 09:33.123
You get right down
there with him.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.192
‐Sorry, chief.
‐You can't win em all, chief.

09:35.225 --> 09:37.261
Had your bachelor party
all planned out and everything.

09:37.294 --> 09:40.030
Well, I'm not usually one
for that sort of pageantry, so.

09:40.064 --> 09:41.198
But do you wanna know what?

09:41.231 --> 09:42.466
Well, it depends
if what's worth knowing.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.701
The big plan
for your bachelor party

09:43.734 --> 09:46.236
is also the same plan that's
gonna get you over the hump here

09:47.104 --> 09:49.273
‐Really?
‐Why are you so squirrelly?

09:49.306 --> 09:50.474
No.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.142
They oughtta stop
calling you squirrelly.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.778
I think I know
what's on deck here.

09:53.811 --> 09:55.780
Five bucks says you do,
shady Katy.

09:55.813 --> 09:57.414
Yous are goin' off Broadway.

09:57.447 --> 09:59.149
The ballet. The cabaret.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.851
The showroom. The S‐club.

10:00.885 --> 10:02.486
‐The juice bar.
‐The observatory.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.754
The night shift.

10:03.788 --> 10:05.322
Take a little trip to Euhornia.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.824
Investigate area 69.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.425
‐The dollar holler.
‐The snail tracker.

10:08.458 --> 10:09.994
What the fuck
are yous talking about?

10:10.027 --> 10:12.096
Merry titsmas, cousint.
We're going to the rippers.

10:12.129 --> 10:13.330
‐The what?
‐The peelers.

10:13.363 --> 10:14.799
‐Huh?
‐We're going to the strip club.

10:14.832 --> 10:15.833
Hooray!

10:15.866 --> 10:18.435
Now, I see why
you were so fucking squirrelly.

10:18.468 --> 10:21.371
We're gonna plunk you right
up front in the meat seats.

10:21.405 --> 10:22.439
Right up gyno‐row.

10:22.472 --> 10:23.507
We'll be so close,
you'll be able

10:23.540 --> 10:24.909
‐to hear the ocean.
‐No.

10:24.942 --> 10:26.343
I'mma take that
nickname away from you

10:26.376 --> 10:28.145
if I don't start
seeing some squirrelly.

10:28.178 --> 10:29.046
There's no way
I can do that

10:29.079 --> 10:30.915
and looks Professor Tricia
in the eye.

10:30.948 --> 10:32.516
We've come too far as a species

10:32.549 --> 10:34.384
to take part in such
primitive behaviors.

10:35.252 --> 10:36.320
‐Hey, Dan.
‐Yeah.

10:36.353 --> 10:37.988
‐What's better than a lecture?
‐What?

10:38.022 --> 10:39.023
A leave.

10:40.224 --> 10:41.959
Okay.

10:41.992 --> 10:43.027
I'm gonna go eat your food.

10:44.328 --> 10:46.430
Well, I really do
appreciate it cousint,

10:46.463 --> 10:48.132
but I think I'll take a pass.

10:48.699 --> 10:49.600
Too late, good buddy.

10:49.634 --> 10:51.802
Your best pal got at me
to get this sorted

10:51.836 --> 10:52.970
eight fiscal weeks ago.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.106
‐Who me?
‐No.

10:56.140 --> 10:58.342
‐Then who?
‐Wayne, how are you now?

10:58.375 --> 10:59.910
‐McMurray, what?
‐That's right.

10:59.944 --> 11:00.978
‐How are you...
‐How are you now?

11:01.011 --> 11:02.112
‐Well, not bad.
‐How are you now?

11:02.146 --> 11:03.848
‐Fine, I said how are you now.
‐Fine, count to three.

11:03.881 --> 11:05.115
‐So, you know.
‐Stop talking.

11:05.149 --> 11:06.817
‐I know. Three.
‐One, two, three.

11:06.851 --> 11:08.318
‐And then, I stop talking.
‐That's when you fucking stop.

11:08.352 --> 11:11.321
‐Told him to stop talking.
‐Don't you start talking now.

11:11.355 --> 11:12.489
‐You're only making it worse.
‐(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

11:12.522 --> 11:17.094
It's not gonna get any better
unless you stop talking.

11:26.536 --> 11:28.238
They've been here all night?

11:28.272 --> 11:30.007
They keep drinking,
I keep pouring.

11:31.976 --> 11:33.277
Yeah!

11:33.310 --> 11:35.145
But you can't
legally serve booze

11:35.179 --> 11:37.347
between the hours
of 2am and 11am.

11:37.381 --> 11:38.415
I don't give a shit.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.457
Oh!

11:49.293 --> 11:50.194
What's first, gents?

11:50.227 --> 11:53.063
Bench press? Leg press?
Military press?

11:53.097 --> 11:54.865
‐Press pause.
‐You're done working out.

11:54.899 --> 11:57.001
‐Why?
‐Need to be quick in a fight.

11:57.034 --> 11:59.169
It's like being a hockey player.
Bulk will only slow you down.

11:59.203 --> 12:01.005
Explosive speed. Agility.

12:01.038 --> 12:02.439
‐Excuse me?
‐What?

12:02.472 --> 12:04.341
Our job was to get him muscle.

12:04.374 --> 12:06.576
Your job is to teach him
how to use it.

12:06.611 --> 12:07.878
‐Sit down.
‐We will

12:07.912 --> 12:09.847
absolutely not sit down.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.982
‐Sit down.
‐As you wish.

12:12.016 --> 12:14.619
Why the precipitous
modification of course?

12:14.652 --> 12:16.286
I got jacked so I could fight.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.055
‐And win.
‐I'm packin'.

12:18.088 --> 12:19.423
I'll say.

12:19.456 --> 12:21.626
‐Mmm.
‐Mmm‐hmm.

12:21.659 --> 12:23.527
‐So, what's the problem?
‐You can't take a punch.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.095
‐Yes, I can.
‐No, you can't.

12:25.129 --> 12:26.430
Yes, I can.

12:26.463 --> 12:28.933
‐Roald.
‐Roald!

12:28.966 --> 12:30.234
‐Dude.
‐Good. Come.

12:31.602 --> 12:32.870
Sit.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.141
‐Roald?
‐Stewart.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.910
Roald's on our team
for this one.

12:39.944 --> 12:41.578
Can we be on Stewart's team?

12:41.612 --> 12:43.213
We'll be on Stewart's team.

12:43.247 --> 12:44.314
What are we even doing here?

12:46.416 --> 12:47.517
‐Cousint?
‐Cousint.

12:47.551 --> 12:51.288
All know, I generally pass
on this sort of pageantry.

12:51.321 --> 12:52.923
Give him a kick
in the bum, cousint.

12:52.957 --> 12:54.592
Suck it up, buttercup.

12:54.625 --> 12:55.626
I'm going to the outlet malls.

12:55.660 --> 12:58.128
I'll be back to pick yous up
in a couple hours.

12:58.162 --> 13:00.464
If you yanks have one thing
sorted, it's your shopping.

13:00.497 --> 13:01.565
Adios.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.635
Why'd we have to come
stateside for this?

13:04.669 --> 13:07.171
Everyone knows the best
rippers are stateside.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.073
Especially my buddy, Dierks.

13:09.106 --> 13:11.308
‐Dierks?
‐Yeah. Like Dierks Bentley.

13:11.341 --> 13:14.178
Dierks. That man is a legend.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.379
‐You know him?
‐Of course, I do.

13:15.412 --> 13:16.480
Who do you think
helped me orchestrate

13:16.513 --> 13:17.648
this for my best friend Wayne?

13:17.682 --> 13:19.316
‐And he's a legend?
‐Of course, he is.

13:19.349 --> 13:21.051
Why do you think they
call him ol' long dick Dierks?

13:21.085 --> 13:23.153
Dierks loves peelers
and the peelers love Dierks.

13:23.187 --> 13:25.155
‐Oh, is that what they do?
‐Course, they do.

13:25.189 --> 13:27.157
Why do you think they call
him ol' long dong Dierks?

13:27.191 --> 13:28.392
How many guesses do I get?

13:29.493 --> 13:30.360
Maybe yous should call me

13:30.394 --> 13:33.698
ol' long dick Dary
while we're in here.

13:33.731 --> 13:36.066
Better clear it with
ol' long dick Dierks first.

13:38.435 --> 13:39.604
Gentlemen.

13:41.105 --> 13:43.073
The ballet awaits.

14:27.384 --> 14:28.418
Dierks.

14:30.487 --> 14:31.756
Oh, hi, smooth cock,
how are you?

14:31.789 --> 14:33.658
Ol' long dick himself!

14:33.691 --> 14:36.060
Booboo kitty fuck. Who's Daryl?

14:36.460 --> 14:37.995
Him.

14:38.028 --> 14:40.064
Well, what's left of him anyway.

14:40.097 --> 14:42.132
Very cool. Very cool, very nice.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.168
‐And Wayne?
‐Right here.

14:44.201 --> 14:46.536
Yup. This is Wayne.

14:46.570 --> 14:48.138
My best friend, Wayne.

14:48.172 --> 14:49.573
Heard a lot about you, hot beef.

14:49.607 --> 14:51.642
‐K.
‐Look at you. Very stiff.

14:51.676 --> 14:54.311
Very phallic, very phallic,
Very fresh.

14:54.344 --> 14:56.013
Some quick math. One, two.

14:56.814 --> 14:58.082
Three, four.

15:00.818 --> 15:02.519
My treat. Ladies, please.

15:04.121 --> 15:05.189
Easy now, Dierksy.

15:06.691 --> 15:08.525
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you.

15:10.060 --> 15:11.095
But no thank you.

15:11.829 --> 15:13.063
Respectfully.

15:13.097 --> 15:15.299
Very respectful.
Very respectful.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.802
Very smooth. But it's okay,
big dad. They love it.

15:17.835 --> 15:20.605
No thank you. Respectfully.

15:20.638 --> 15:22.372
Very certain. Very certain.

15:22.406 --> 15:24.574
Very stoic. Your call,
sweet and sexy.

15:24.609 --> 15:26.510
Let's have a drink, cousint.

15:28.412 --> 15:30.314
‐Baby steps.
‐Your terms are acceptable.

15:31.481 --> 15:32.617
Thank you very much, ladies.

15:32.650 --> 15:33.684
It's not you.

15:33.984 --> 15:35.385
Cheers.

15:35.419 --> 15:36.520
To very hot guys.

15:41.091 --> 15:42.793
Not your type?
Very fair, cute guy.

15:42.827 --> 15:44.328
Very fair, very focused.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.796
Not my type either.
I like a tomboy.

15:45.830 --> 15:50.167
Tomboys are decisive.
Very decisive, very deserving.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.501
Very disciplined.
You like a tomboy?

15:53.203 --> 15:54.639
I'm hammered.

15:54.672 --> 15:57.074
Would you look at
that one over there?

15:57.675 --> 15:59.576
She is something tiny.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.211
Yeah, you should
maybe have an eye.

16:01.245 --> 16:03.147
When McMurray gets hammered,
he starts saying stuff...

16:03.180 --> 16:05.683
She's so tiny, you could
just pick her up,

16:05.716 --> 16:09.419
put her on top of you and then
just jerk yourself of with her.

16:09.453 --> 16:10.588
I'd have a piss.

16:15.860 --> 16:17.561
Hey.

16:17.595 --> 16:21.832
‐Hey.
‐Oh, Bonnie McMurray!

16:21.866 --> 16:23.533
Yous are going hard.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.369
We owe it to Ovi.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.471
Ovi raised the bar
for Cup celly's.

16:27.504 --> 16:30.808
Ovi! Ovi! Ovi! Ovi!

16:30.841 --> 16:34.378
Hey. Hey. You've been
playing this song all day.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.379
Let's switch it up.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.648
First guy in the room
picks the music, sniper.

16:37.682 --> 16:39.583
Seniority rules, sniper.

16:39.617 --> 16:42.486
Jock Jams for days.

16:42.519 --> 16:45.455
Ovi! Ovi! Ovi!

16:45.489 --> 16:48.525
‐Ovi!
‐Yeah. Okay. Jams.

16:48.558 --> 16:49.794
You're only playing one.

16:51.395 --> 16:54.198
We're number one!
We're number one!

16:54.231 --> 16:55.733
‐Okay, okay.
‐We're number one!

16:55.766 --> 16:58.402
We're number one!
We're number one!

16:58.435 --> 17:01.639
Hey. Everyone in here
is getting chapped ass.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.307
How many cups have they won?

17:03.340 --> 17:05.810
Talk to me when
you've won a Cupski!

17:08.512 --> 17:11.782
We're number one!
We're number one!

17:11.816 --> 17:16.286
We're number one!
We're number one!

17:19.657 --> 17:20.925
‐How are you now?
‐Good and you?

17:20.958 --> 17:22.359
‐Not so bad.
‐What are you doing?

17:23.260 --> 17:24.795
Oh, I'd rather not say.

17:24.829 --> 17:27.264
But I'm doing it haphazardly.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.699
Haphazardly's a funny word.

17:28.733 --> 17:29.800
Do you wanna know
what else is a funny word?

17:29.834 --> 17:31.335
‐What?
‐Tiramisu.

17:31.368 --> 17:32.269
You in a mood to run the dogs?

17:32.302 --> 17:33.938
Oh, I'm always in
a mood to run the dogs.

17:33.971 --> 17:37.341
‐Pitter patter.
‐I can't though. Currently.

17:37.374 --> 17:39.677
‐Rain check?
‐I should say.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.779
I got a Monopoly board
and all the properties

17:41.812 --> 17:43.313
are places from Letterkenny.

17:43.347 --> 17:45.349
‐Oh yeah, which one's Boardwalk?
‐MoDean's.

17:45.382 --> 17:46.917
MoDean's one, two or three?

17:46.951 --> 17:48.686
You'll have to
come by to find out.

17:49.386 --> 17:51.488
‐Soon?
‐Sooner than later.

17:51.521 --> 17:52.623
Bring Stormy.

17:52.657 --> 17:54.692
If you don't I'll point you
back where you came from.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.393
‐Good enough.
‐Talk to ya.

17:56.426 --> 17:57.494
Yup we'll talk to ya.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.732
‐Hola.
‐Hola.

18:01.766 --> 18:03.601

‐Vene‐thwela.

18:03.634 --> 18:05.202
‐And you?
‐Vene‐fwela.

18:05.235 --> 18:06.637
‐And you?
‐Vene‐huela.

18:06.671 --> 18:09.239
Is that right?
Say one more time.

18:09.273 --> 18:10.540
‐Vene‐thwela.
‐Okay.

18:10.574 --> 18:11.809
‐Vene‐fwela.
‐Okay.

18:11.842 --> 18:13.577
‐Vene‐huela.
‐Oh, fuck, there you go.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.547
The line to the ladies
was too long.

18:17.581 --> 18:19.917
‐Okay.
‐You're ol' long dick's buddy

18:19.950 --> 18:21.185
I'm his acquaintance.

18:21.218 --> 18:24.288
We had your bachelor party all
lined up a couple months back.

18:24.321 --> 18:25.656
Dierks canceled last minute.

18:25.690 --> 18:27.858
‐Way she goes.
‐Well, no ring, I see.

18:27.892 --> 18:30.560
‐Can't win 'em all.
‐I'll do the math.

18:30.595 --> 18:32.496
Everyone's always
fuckin' someone else.

18:33.831 --> 18:35.900
Well, not everyone.

18:35.933 --> 18:37.902
Got any reason
to believe otherwise?

18:37.935 --> 18:39.670
You're a good old boy then.

18:39.704 --> 18:41.739
Dying breed.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.875
Get real. Everybody's always
fuckin' someone else.

18:47.411 --> 18:48.713
Getting back out there?

18:48.746 --> 18:50.214
Oh, I don't think I...

18:53.818 --> 18:55.519
Have any other option.

18:56.821 --> 18:57.922
Excuse me.

18:59.724 --> 19:01.826
Alejandro. Alijandro.
Allesandro.

19:01.859 --> 19:03.628
‐Vene‐thwela.
‐Vene‐thwela.

19:03.661 --> 19:04.695
Vene‐thwela.

19:05.763 --> 19:06.764
Why is Roald on your team?

19:06.797 --> 19:08.699
Can't be on the same team
if you're gonna fight.

19:08.733 --> 19:10.300
‐We're gonna fight?
‐Stewart?

19:10.334 --> 19:11.936
‐I refuse.
‐Then you fight me.

19:11.969 --> 19:13.370
‐You?
‐Or me.

19:14.705 --> 19:16.807
‐No.
‐Good. Roald, then.

19:16.841 --> 19:19.409
‐Roald is my best friend.
‐Stewart.

19:19.443 --> 19:21.578
Uh, whatever happened
to personal besties?

19:21.612 --> 19:23.013
Put it on a t‐shirt!

19:23.047 --> 19:24.481
I will not strike him.

19:24.514 --> 19:25.750
‐Don't have to.
‐(SCOFFS)

19:26.651 --> 19:27.718
Just. (SCOFFS)

19:27.752 --> 19:30.287
What in the fuck
is transpiring here?

19:30.320 --> 19:32.522
You can't get hit.
So, you're gonna dodge.

19:32.556 --> 19:34.291
Let your opponent
tire himself out.

19:34.324 --> 19:36.526
When he opens up, bam!

19:36.560 --> 19:38.663
‐Finish it, got it?
‐Got it.

19:38.696 --> 19:39.730
‐Good.
‐Go.

19:40.564 --> 19:41.799
ROALD: No.
ALL: Yes.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.500
ROALD: No.
ALL: Yes.

19:43.533 --> 19:44.635
‐No.
‐You want to see him

19:44.669 --> 19:45.970
get knocked the fuck
out in the city?

19:46.003 --> 19:47.437
‐No.
‐You want to see him layin'

19:47.471 --> 19:50.440
stiff as a board on
the dance floor? Snoring?

19:50.474 --> 19:51.541
No.

19:51.575 --> 19:52.777
Then help your friend!

19:53.878 --> 19:55.012
Roald.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.648
‐Help me.
‐(SQUEALS)

20:00.918 --> 20:03.053
I'll love you
till my dying breath!

20:03.821 --> 20:06.323
(GRUNTS)

20:23.573 --> 20:25.075
How the fuck did you do that?

20:26.677 --> 20:28.012
Dance Dance Revolution.

20:28.045 --> 20:29.513
Well he's tired, finish him.

20:29.546 --> 20:31.448
I will not strike
my best friend.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.582
Stewart.

20:34.084 --> 20:35.385
But I will finish it.

20:40.658 --> 20:42.526
‐Somebody count it.
‐Is he ready?

20:44.161 --> 20:45.663
You two will be there, right?

20:45.696 --> 20:47.865
‐There another hundo in it?
‐Yeah.

20:47.898 --> 20:50.067
‐Still.
‐Many ribs as you can hoover.

20:51.101 --> 20:52.837
So? Is he ready?

20:53.704 --> 20:55.039
(BOTH) Sure.

20:55.072 --> 20:56.707
STEWART: Can someone
count it out?

20:56.741 --> 20:58.442
Since I first pinned him,

20:58.475 --> 20:59.476
Roald has...

21:01.545 --> 21:03.347
Enhanced.

21:09.086 --> 21:10.420
You want to do what to me?

21:12.590 --> 21:14.391
First of at least a few, boys.

21:14.424 --> 21:16.994
No sex in the champagne room,
tight pants, busy hands.

21:17.027 --> 21:18.495
Where's fuckin' Dary?

21:18.528 --> 21:19.830
I haven't seen him
since that gal

21:19.864 --> 21:21.732
with the pole moves
got off stage.

21:21.766 --> 21:23.067
Hey, who wants a shotski?

21:23.100 --> 21:24.802
Hey, please and thank you,
cousint.

21:27.805 --> 21:29.573
I wish you'd enjoy the bounty,
tall and regal.

21:29.607 --> 21:31.508
Wish you weren't so fuckin'
awkward, bud.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.710
‐What's that?
‐Nothing.

21:32.743 --> 21:35.545
‐You want?
‐No, thank you.

21:35.579 --> 21:37.915
‐Respectfully.
‐Thank you, Tyla.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.984
Very cool, very cool.
Very nice, smooth.

21:42.486 --> 21:44.021
So?

21:44.054 --> 21:45.089
What was her steez?

21:45.823 --> 21:47.091
Who?

21:47.124 --> 21:49.459
Your runaway bride. Tits?

21:49.493 --> 21:50.828
Oh, I know a tit man
when I see one.

21:50.861 --> 21:53.698
Like the tits.
Like the ass, too.

21:53.731 --> 21:55.933
I like what's up top most,
you know what I mean?

21:55.966 --> 21:58.202
‐The eyes?
‐Grey matter, baby boo.

21:58.235 --> 21:59.804
I tell you, I like a tomboy?

21:59.837 --> 22:00.905
You did.

22:00.938 --> 22:02.572
Tomboy knows what she wants.

22:02.607 --> 22:04.074
No one knows
what they want anymore.

22:05.242 --> 22:06.576
But you know
a thing or two about that,

22:06.611 --> 22:07.612
don't you, cute butt?

22:09.013 --> 22:10.480
Yup.

22:10.514 --> 22:13.017
Everyone's always fuckin'
somebody else.

22:13.050 --> 22:14.719
How you like
ol' long dick, cousint?

22:14.752 --> 22:16.086
Fuckin' legend, amirite?

22:17.054 --> 22:17.955
Bottoms up.

22:17.988 --> 22:19.690
If you're not gonna
titty taste nectar,

22:19.724 --> 22:21.158
at least we're gonna get you
Liberace lubricated.

22:24.061 --> 22:25.896
Wayne?

22:25.930 --> 22:27.698
‐Dary?
‐I'm in love.

22:28.165 --> 22:29.700
With a stripper.

22:31.936 --> 22:33.604
‐Wayne?
‐McMurray.

22:33.638 --> 22:34.839
It's the stripper.

22:34.872 --> 22:36.506
She's in love with me.

22:36.540 --> 22:38.809
Fuckin' cool, very cool.
Very nice.

22:45.716 --> 22:46.851
Easy Bono.

22:46.884 --> 22:48.719
Don't poke the bear.

22:48.753 --> 22:51.021
They've been drinking for
a c‐hair short of 24 hours.

22:51.789 --> 22:52.790
I think we're good.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.501
(SNORING)

23:10.040 --> 23:11.541
Reilly and Jones?

23:13.143 --> 23:14.244
Reilly and Jones?

23:16.180 --> 23:18.182
‐He's Reilly.
‐He's Jonesy.

23:18.215 --> 23:21.185
You've been selected as
BROdude brand ambassadors.

23:21.218 --> 23:22.953
Congratulations.

23:22.987 --> 23:24.054
Are you seri‐dog?

23:24.088 --> 23:25.555
(SIGHS)

23:26.691 --> 23:27.758
She's seri‐dog.

23:27.792 --> 23:28.793
Photo.

23:43.140 --> 23:44.208
Sick, buddy.

23:44.241 --> 23:46.777
You guys sponsor the
senior hockey tournament, right?

23:46.811 --> 23:48.913
The National Senior
Hockey Championship?

23:48.946 --> 23:49.847
Yes.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.682
I can't believe
you guys thought of us.

23:51.716 --> 23:52.817
‐I didn't.
‐Oh.

23:52.850 --> 23:54.584
For the record, no part of this,

23:54.619 --> 23:56.954
not a shard of it, not a ribbon
of it, not a suggestion of it

23:56.987 --> 23:57.955
‐was my idea.
‐Oh.

23:57.988 --> 24:00.758
Also, for the record,
every fiber of my being,

24:00.791 --> 24:02.593
internal and external feels

24:02.627 --> 24:03.794
this is a horrifying waste

24:03.828 --> 24:06.130
of time, money, resources
and materials.

24:06.163 --> 24:07.698
And materials?

24:07.732 --> 24:09.233
I believe, the hats
you're wearing

24:09.266 --> 24:11.769
belong on the heads
of legitimate athletes.

24:11.802 --> 24:14.605
Professionals not washed up,
never have beens

24:14.639 --> 24:16.573
taking a victory lap
through whale shit.

24:16.607 --> 24:19.209
‐Gutty.
‐Well, whose idea was it then?

24:19.243 --> 24:20.645
‐Kids.
‐Kids?

24:20.678 --> 24:23.247
Juveniles, sprouts, squirts,
non‐voters.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.149
You know, the kids saw
you on TSN with

24:25.182 --> 24:27.051
all your chirp‐snipe‐celly
and this is

24:27.084 --> 24:28.919
relatable to them, apparently.

24:28.953 --> 24:30.287
It's actually wheel‐snipe‐celly.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.022
Not anymore.

24:32.056 --> 24:34.859
The term "wheel"
has sexual connotations.

24:34.892 --> 24:36.927
And may not and must not be used
by either one of you

24:36.961 --> 24:38.863
while wearing
the BROdude logo, got it?

24:38.896 --> 24:39.864
‐Got it.
‐Good.

24:39.897 --> 24:42.700
You know, the one win
I've had in this process

24:42.733 --> 24:45.135
is getting the brass to agree
to test you two on a trial basis

24:45.169 --> 24:46.604
before taking it to the media.

24:46.637 --> 24:47.938
Your task is to head up

24:47.972 --> 24:50.107
a regional initiative
branding project.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.876
Basically, because
you're basics...

24:51.909 --> 24:54.078
Start a club.
Right here in Lettercunty.

24:54.111 --> 24:56.981
‐Actually, it's pronounced...
‐I know how it's pronounced.

24:57.014 --> 24:59.216
See how many people you can get
on board with the BROdude brand

24:59.249 --> 25:00.918
locally and we'll go from there.
Okay?

25:00.951 --> 25:03.087
‐Sick.
‐Sweet.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.354
How's the photo?

25:07.925 --> 25:09.293
Oh my God.

25:12.697 --> 25:15.132
Has anyone ever told you two

25:15.165 --> 25:17.702
that you're unintentionally
hilarious?

25:17.735 --> 25:19.136
Because this is the lolziest.

25:19.169 --> 25:20.304
Look at you.

25:20.337 --> 25:22.172
You look like you're fighting
a second to second battle

25:22.206 --> 25:25.309
to keep your eyes from crossing.
And you,

25:25.342 --> 25:28.145
when you smile it looks like
you're saying the word "her"

25:28.178 --> 25:29.279
with a dozen "Rs"
at the end of it.

25:29.313 --> 25:32.182
Like, "herrrrrr."

25:32.216 --> 25:33.818
Try it with me. Both of you.

25:34.719 --> 25:38.656
(TOGETHER) "Herrrrrr."

25:40.057 --> 25:41.792
It's an appropriate look.

25:41.826 --> 25:43.828
Can you work your magic
or should we try again?

25:43.861 --> 25:45.029
No,

25:45.062 --> 25:47.765
never mind, I don't care.

25:47.798 --> 25:50.334
'Cause this will never
go the distance.

25:50.367 --> 25:52.236
You have your task,
start a club.

25:52.970 --> 25:54.672
"Herrrrrr."

25:57.074 --> 25:58.242
W.

25:58.275 --> 26:00.745
They don't ask how,
they ask how many.

26:03.147 --> 26:05.382
Who changed
the fuckin' tuneskis!

26:05.415 --> 26:07.718
Jock jams for daysss!

26:15.359 --> 26:19.697
Ovi! Ovi! Ovi! Ovi!

26:19.730 --> 26:20.798
Perv row power naps.

26:20.831 --> 26:23.801
Very cool. Very cool,
very critical. Very clutch.

26:25.803 --> 26:27.137
How's the talent up north,
big boy?

26:27.171 --> 26:29.239
I gotta get me
a Canadian girl.

26:29.273 --> 26:31.008
Do they go?
Hook me up.

26:31.041 --> 26:32.309
Why would I do that?

26:32.342 --> 26:34.044
'Cause I'm your buddy Dierks.

26:34.078 --> 26:35.445
‐No, you're not.
‐Okay.

26:35.479 --> 26:36.714
I'm your pal, Dierks.

26:38.749 --> 26:40.217
I don't like you, dude.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.351
You fuckin' with me?

26:41.385 --> 26:43.387
I've met a million guys like you

26:43.420 --> 26:44.955
and you're the worst of 'em all.

26:44.989 --> 26:45.856
Perhaps a little big?

26:45.890 --> 26:47.357
I'm never gonna
fuckin' see you again,

26:47.391 --> 26:49.359
so let me leave you with this,

26:49.393 --> 26:52.162
clean it up and keep it tidy,

26:52.196 --> 26:54.164
'Cause you're a fuckin' mess.
