WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:07.860
The judge will be here any minute.
Are you finished painting?

00:07.900 --> 00:08.600
Yeah.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.260
Well, then what are you doing?

00:10.300 --> 00:14.000
I'm watching a naked couple in the building
across the alley. They're fooling around.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.400
That's depraved.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.000
Too soon to tell.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.500
I meant you.

00:20.540 --> 00:23.500
How would you like somebody
watching you and your wife doing that?

00:23.540 --> 00:24.800
My wife wouldn't do that.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.100
Out.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.500
-How are you?
-God, I was so close.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.560
-Hi, Bull. Any sign of the new judge?
-Not yet.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.800
Say Lana, what's this guy
supposed to be like?

00:46.840 --> 00:48.100
I don't know.

00:48.140 --> 00:51.600
Our ex-major just filled
all the vacancies on the court
on his last day in office.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.800
Nobody knows who was appointed
or where they were assigned.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.500
I think that's mercurial.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.700
Did you say "mercurial"?

01:00.740 --> 01:02.800
I'm trying to make up
for my lack of education.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.000
So every month I pick a word
at random out of the dictionary

01:06.040 --> 01:07.900
and use it all that month.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.300
My! How…

01:11.340 --> 01:13.100
Minimifidian?

01:14.800 --> 01:16.800
Is that a real word?

01:16.840 --> 01:19.700
Does a bear extravasate
in the forest?

01:22.900 --> 01:24.200
What?

01:26.100 --> 01:27.500
No.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.800
Tell the judge the major called.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.600
Bye, Bull.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.700
Hello.

01:37.740 --> 01:39.800
Is that stuff for the judge?

01:40.900 --> 01:41.800
Yeah.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.000
And what is it?

01:43.500 --> 01:45.200
It looks like junk to me.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.700
Well, stick it over in the corner.

01:47.740 --> 01:48.900
Right.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.900
My name is Harry.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.400
So?

01:55.000 --> 01:55.700
I get your drift.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.900
-Is he here yet?
-Not yet, Sheila.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.500
-Good evening, Daniel.
-Good evening.

02:01.540 --> 02:02.800
Do I look all right?

02:02.840 --> 02:05.800
You look fine, Sheila.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.600
-Doesn't she, Dan?
-Yeah, swell.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.500
Anything at all?

02:11.540 --> 02:15.700
"Nada".
I was just told to expect him tonight.

02:15.740 --> 02:17.900
He's got a background
in criminal law.

02:17.940 --> 02:20.400
I hope he plays chess.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.000
A new man has been
appointed to the bench

02:24.040 --> 02:27.500
and all that you hope for
is someone who can play chess.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.400
I also hope his first name
is not Chucky.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.100
-Package for judge Stone.
-He's not here.

02:36.140 --> 02:37.800
Great view!

02:38.500 --> 02:42.500
What are you doing up there?
I'm watching this guy trying to…

02:44.800 --> 02:46.200
Get off of there.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.500
The judge has to sign
for this himself.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.500
I said he is not here.

02:50.540 --> 02:52.000
Oh, yes, he is.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
What?

02:57.300 --> 02:58.600
You don't mean…

03:02.600 --> 03:06.100
You are judge
Harold T. Stone?

03:06.140 --> 03:07.200
Yeah.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.500
You are really a judge?

03:11.540 --> 03:16.600
Listen, if I weren't the judge,
could I do this?

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.800 --> 03:36.200
-In his office?
-No. I guess not.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.100
There you go.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.200
Thanks.
Sorry, I don't tip.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.460
Besides, how do I know
you're not the type

03:44.500 --> 03:47.200
to go out and spend it
on a Barry Manilow album?

03:51.300 --> 03:52.200
Cover me.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.600
Judge Stone.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.800
Dan Fielding.
Assistant District Attorney.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.900
Nice to meet you.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.400
I'm Sheila Gardiner.
Attorney with legal aid.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.500
Pleasure is mine.

04:07.500 --> 04:12.600
I'm Lana Wagner.
Your court clerk.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.300
Couldn't you just die?

05:16.100 --> 05:17.900
Pay no attention
to the gossip.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.400
On you they look good.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.500
I don't know
what's holding the judge up.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.000
Diaper change, perhaps.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.200
All rise.

05:36.300 --> 05:40.000
Criminal court's
part two, city New York
is now in session.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.700
The honorable

05:41.740 --> 05:47.900
Harold T. Stone presiding.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.400
Gotcha!

06:10.200 --> 06:10.960
Your honor…

06:11.000 --> 06:12.800
I've always wanted
to see that happen.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.860
Your honor, far be it from me
to advise what matters…

06:16.900 --> 06:18.660
-Where's my gavel?
-I beg your pardon?

06:18.700 --> 06:21.400
-That little hammer thing?
-Yes, I know what it is.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.100
Ladies and gentleman,
off the court.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.100
Well, how the hell
are you tonight?

06:31.500 --> 06:32.600
So, the first case…

06:32.900 --> 06:35.400
Harry? Is that you?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.800
Hacksaw?
Come on down.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.000
He has a friend
named Hacksaw?

06:43.040 --> 06:45.800
Blacky and Lefty
must be caught in traffic.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.900
-Hacksaw, how are you doing?
-Well, you know.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.700
Three card monte again, huh?

06:51.300 --> 06:53.300
Guilty as seen, your honor.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.060
Ms. Wagner, prepare the file
on Hamming Lener G.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.460
Sir, that's not the first case…

06:57.500 --> 06:59.800
Ms. Gardiner, your client's
pleading guilty to a misdemeanor.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.000
-Be right there.
-That'll cost you 50 bucks, Hacksaw.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.000
-What's the fine?
-50 bucks.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.100
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

07:05.140 --> 07:06.400
-Here's the file.
-Case closed!

07:07.900 --> 07:09.900
Good to see you, Hacksaw,
really good.

07:09.940 --> 07:10.800
You too, Har.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.600
That was quick.
What's next?

07:13.640 --> 07:16.000
-I hate you!
-Well, I hate you more!

07:16.040 --> 07:17.500
We'll talk later.

07:17.540 --> 07:20.700
Your whole family is crazy.
Their chromosomes aren't normal.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.300
And they all look like sleekies.

07:22.340 --> 07:24.600
You leave my family
out of this, you…

07:36.300 --> 07:39.400
Let's put a lid
on this assiduousness.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.160
State vs. Kerr, your honor.
Your honor, this case has some…

07:48.200 --> 07:49.600
Let's all gather
around the big desk.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.300
This case has some
intricate facets…

07:53.000 --> 07:54.800
Can you give it to me
in a nutshell?

07:55.700 --> 07:58.000
Husband and wife
married 27 years.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.100
She catches him
with a prostitute,

08:00.140 --> 08:02.760
fires a couple of shots,
misses them both by a mile,

08:02.800 --> 08:04.900
so the DA files
for attempted murder.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.800
-This could go either way.
-Yes.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.200
-Unless…
-What?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.500
No, I guess
it's got to go either way.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.800
-Your honor…
-Hi.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.500
Hi.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.000
-Phillip Kerr?
-Yes, sir.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.600
-Louise Kerr?
-Here.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.299
Carla Buvoir?

08:32.339 --> 08:34.799
They call me Carla B.,
your honor.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.799
I'm probably down there for alleged
solicitation of prostitution or something.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.900
Right you are.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.360
Your honor, may I?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.860
Mr. prosecutor,
Miss Gardiner,

08:48.900 --> 08:51.200
I am prepared to listen
to the testimony,

08:51.240 --> 08:53.100
cross-examine the witnesses,

08:53.140 --> 08:56.500
consider the precedence,
that I'm sure you both prepared,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.400
but I don't think
that's gonna be necessary.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.060
What do you mean,
it's not necessary?

09:02.100 --> 09:03.400
Glad you asked.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.900
We will now take
a short recess.

09:05.940 --> 09:08.800
During that time I order
the defendant, Ms. Kerr,

09:08.840 --> 09:11.900
and her husband, Mr. Kerr
and the attorneys involved

09:12.000 --> 09:14.600
to go to a
nearby restaurant.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.100
Sit down,
have a cup of coffee,

09:17.140 --> 09:19.500
relax, try to work out
this little thing.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.000
Your honor,
this is highly irregular.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.560
Thanks.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Court's recessed.

09:32.100 --> 09:36.700
I cannot work with that man.
He is disrupting my court!

09:37.300 --> 09:38.960
There isn't much
we can do.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.360
What does that mean?

09:40.400 --> 09:44.460
A judicial review board
takes months, sometimes even years

09:44.500 --> 09:46.200
to investigate a suspect judge.

09:46.240 --> 09:49.960
And then they're usually only given
an official reprimand.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
It is virtually impossible
to remove a sitting judge
from the bench.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.800
So what you're saying is…

09:58.500 --> 10:00.200
We have to kill him.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.800
Sir, I have to speak with you.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.700
Lana, good to see you.
Come over here.

10:16.500 --> 10:20.960
Your honor, I feel that it's my duty
to discuss with you your behavior…

10:21.000 --> 10:22.200
Pick a card.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.800
Sir, I have
urgent business to discuss.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.700
You can talk while you're doing this.
Come on.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.400
Now, what's on your mind?

10:31.440 --> 10:35.160
Judge Stone, I think
your actions on the court case

10:35.200 --> 10:39.400
were impulsive, unorthodox
and totally irresponsible.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.500
My god, they're at it again?

10:47.400 --> 10:48.500
Your honor!

10:48.540 --> 10:51.500
-Come on, call me Harry.
-I don't think I can.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.800
Yeah, my baby brother
had trouble pronouncing it too.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.700
Used to come out "Ha wee"

10:58.000 --> 10:59.200
Call me "Ha wee"

10:59.240 --> 11:00.800
You're crazy.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.660
I mean, an attempt of murder
and you send the plaintiff

11:03.700 --> 11:05.500
and the defendant
out for a cup of coffee?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.900
What do murderers get, brunch?

11:09.100 --> 11:12.200
All right, my methods are informal.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.300
Give them a chance.
They might work.

11:17.340 --> 11:19.700
Maybe, just maybe,
it'll work.

11:25.300 --> 11:28.300
And again,
maybe someday pigs will fly.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.900
Oh, my God. Sheila, Dan,
are you all right?

11:33.940 --> 11:35.100
What happened?

11:35.140 --> 11:36.400
You wanna know what happened?

11:41.300 --> 11:42.500
I'll tell you what happened.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.700
No settlement with the Kerrs.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.800
It must have been awful.

11:51.100 --> 11:55.500
I loved my shirt.

12:00.700 --> 12:03.100
I really thought it would work.

12:05.800 --> 12:12.200
I'm sorry, I really am
but it was predictable.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.600
Yeah, maybe it was.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.700
You're a tarantula.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.900
You've never used language
like that to me before!

12:29.940 --> 12:31.700
You never tried
to shoot me before.

12:32.600 --> 12:36.300
Pipe down or I'm gonna turn Bull loose
to kick some butt.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.800
Try to look menacing.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
Good.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.200
All right, everybody sit down.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
I thought I sent you two away
to work this thing out.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.700
I tried to work things out with her
but she won't have none of it.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.300
That's a damn lie.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.600
Don't forget,
Phil is the one that was shot at.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
All right, I want no more shouting
from the gallery.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.200
Do I make myself clear?

13:12.200 --> 13:14.500
Yes, the man in the back
in the bath robe.

13:15.400 --> 13:19.200
Are oo's and oh's okay?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.300
They're fine.

13:22.000 --> 13:22.900
Thank you.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.560
Have we started?

13:27.600 --> 13:29.100
Could I have
the Kerr file, please?

13:31.800 --> 13:32.700
All right.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.000
Listen up, folks.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.200
It seems that
there are those

13:41.240 --> 13:44.000
who feel that I am not fit
to be a judge.

13:45.900 --> 13:48.800
It seems that there are those
who think I'm crazy.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.700
Well, frankly,
I just don't know.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.600
Ms. Wagner,
what's that behind your ear?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.700
It's a coin!

14:10.200 --> 14:12.700
My, is the coin of justice.

14:12.740 --> 14:14.360
Sir, I don't think
you're feeling very well.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.260
I'll tell you what.
Let's flip the coin.
Let it decide.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.800
Heads, I stay a judge,
tails, I resign.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.500
Heads, I'm still a judge.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.800
I'm going for an ambulance.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.200
Take a sit, Ms. Wagner.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.200
Now, Phil.

14:33.240 --> 14:37.000
You've been married 27 years.
Is that right?

14:37.300 --> 14:38.360
Yes, sir.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.600
27 years. Gee.
It must have been a living hell.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.400
Oh, well, there was okay times.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.000
Early on.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.000
Let me guess.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.900
You two haven't had that much
to say to each other recently.

14:55.800 --> 15:00.900
Romance has sort of been replaced
by a really good night sleep?

15:05.000 --> 15:09.800
And so he goes to
the other woman.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.200
It's a living.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.160
Crime?
Solicitation.

15:17.300 --> 15:20.600
Heads, I just fine you,
tails, you go to jail.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.300
Heads again,
it's your lucky day.

15:25.340 --> 15:27.800
Could be yours too.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.400
I can appreciate that.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.800
I must protest for the record.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.200
Mr. Fielding,
did you have a happy childhood?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.400
What?

15:41.100 --> 15:44.400
Was it happy? I mean,
did you laugh a lot as a youngster?

15:49.400 --> 15:52.460
-I don't want to answer.
-I don't wanna fine you for contempt.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.100
-I didn't laugh a lot.
-Thank you.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.200
Does anybody understand
what I'm saying here?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.600
Does anyone understand
what I'm trying to do here?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.700
Ms. Wagner.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.300
Sheila.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.500
Bull.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.400
I don't know.
What the hell's going on?

16:19.600 --> 16:23.260
I'm just talking, folks.
You get it?

16:23.300 --> 16:24.800
I'm talking.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.800
You talk to people.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.860
You talk to find out
about them.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.160
Maybe you reveal a little bit
about yourself in the process.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.000
But the main thing is
you get to know them.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.000
You go inside their head.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.200
You find out
what their dreams are,

16:41.240 --> 16:42.600
what their hopes are.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.200
Are there any English
speaking people here tonight?

16:50.300 --> 16:52.200
All right then.
Let's flip the coin again.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.700
Let's decide the Kerr case.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.300
The defense wants heads,
your honor.

17:04.700 --> 17:07.500
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm saying.

17:08.598 --> 17:09.500
Here it is.

17:09.540 --> 17:13.500
Heads, I send Louise
to jail for 7 years,

17:13.540 --> 17:15.400
Tails, we let her go.

17:16.800 --> 17:20.000
Phil, was there anything you wanted
to say to your wife before I flip?

17:21.200 --> 17:22.598
7 years?

17:26.599 --> 17:27.900
Good luck, Louise.

17:32.100 --> 17:35.000
You know, it was your own fault
for trying to shoot me.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.200
Shoot? I fired straight up in the air.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.000
Did you think I would take a chance
on hurting you?

17:41.040 --> 17:42.200
Is that true, Louise?

17:44.500 --> 17:47.600
You think I __

17:47.640 --> 17:52.300
and a gallbladder operation
just to have fill him full of lead?

17:52.340 --> 17:56.000
You mean, you weren't
trying to hurt me?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.800
Louise, I…

18:02.900 --> 18:05.400
Say it, Phil, say it.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.000
I love you, Louise.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.400
And I love you, Phil.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.900
Then what are we doing here?

18:11.940 --> 18:15.400
Phil, can we forget
this whole thing?

18:15.440 --> 18:17.200
I'd like to,
I really would.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.160
Phil, one more flip.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.200
Heads, we send her up the river,
tails, you take her home.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.560
No. Every time you flip
__ comes up heads.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.300
Of course it does.
It's a double headed coin.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.300
Oh, come on.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.900
You didn't think
I believed in luck, did you?

18:48.700 --> 18:51.700
By the power invested in me
by the state of New York

18:52.600 --> 18:54.300
I pronounce you

18:56.900 --> 19:00.500
a little better off than
you were when you came in.

19:20.300 --> 19:23.200
I had a husband just like that.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.500
Oh, yeah?

19:25.200 --> 19:27.600
I had to shoot him too.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.400
Will the counsels
approach the bench, please?

19:38.000 --> 19:42.200
Well, I'm beat.
How about you, guys?

19:42.240 --> 19:44.200
I'll do anything you want.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.400
Terrific. You guys sorted out.

19:46.600 --> 19:52.200
I'm gonna go to my chambers
and do some judge stuff.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.200
-Any questions?
-Just one.

19:59.300 --> 20:02.900
How did you get appointed
to the bench?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.200
You know, Dan,
that's a funny story.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.500
It was the major's
last day in office.

20:11.540 --> 20:12.900
And it was a Sunday.

20:12.940 --> 20:16.900
And my name was at the bottom of a list
of a thousand candidates.

20:16.940 --> 20:20.000
So they start calling folks,
starting at the top of the list.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.300
But you see, it's Sunday
so no one's home.

20:22.340 --> 20:26.800
So they keep calling down the list
name by name. No one answers.

20:26.840 --> 20:31.700
Finally they get down
to the bottom of the list and voilà.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
You mean you were appointed
to judge because…

20:36.800 --> 20:38.000
I was home.

20:41.400 --> 20:46.000
There'll be a 10 minute recess.
Pass it on.

21:20.700 --> 21:21.800
Your honor.

21:35.700 --> 21:37.400
Your honor.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.600
I own every record
Mel Tormé ever made.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.000
I'm gonna marry the girl
that is impressed by that.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.000
I beg your pardon?

21:52.040 --> 21:53.400
You're about to say?

21:54.100 --> 21:56.200
Oh, yes.
They're ready to lock up now.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.300
Fine.

21:58.900 --> 22:03.000
By the way, thanks a lot for being
patient with me tonight.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.300
I am new here, you know.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.700
Yeah, we noticed.

22:07.700 --> 22:11.000
You know, my name was at the bottom
of that list of prospective judges

22:11.040 --> 22:13.200
because I haven't had
much experience really.

22:13.240 --> 22:18.300
But every candidate does go through
a thorough screening process

22:18.340 --> 22:23.300
and whatever anybody thinks
of that list, I was on it.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.800
Good night, Ms. Wagner.

22:28.500 --> 22:31.300
What you did out here tonight

22:33.100 --> 22:34.300
was beautiful.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.300
Oh, in a bohemian sort of way.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.200
No, I mean it.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.300
You saved that marriage.

22:43.340 --> 22:47.000
And the 27 years of love
and memories.

22:47.100 --> 22:49.400
and fulfillment
to go along with it.

22:49.700 --> 22:54.000
Sometimes I get lucky.
Good night.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.100
About my job…

23:01.200 --> 23:03.000
Give me one more chance, huh?

23:06.600 --> 23:12.000
It would be an honor
to call you Harry.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.700
Then it's fortunate
I have that name.
