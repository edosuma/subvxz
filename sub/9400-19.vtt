<i>Previously on "One Tree Hill":</i>

00:01.910 --> 00:03.440
I could have sent that to you.

00:03.440 --> 00:04.500
I came to get my car.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.020
I'm driving it back.

00:06.020 --> 00:08.390
I guess this is goodbye
for a while, then.

00:08.390 --> 00:10.970
Actually, it's goodbye forever.

00:11.590 --> 00:14.650
I think we should
end this -- us.

00:14.650 --> 00:16.590
You deserve more than this.

00:16.590 --> 00:18.010
You'll address your literature class

00:18.010 --> 00:19.820
and explain that you were wrong.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.250
And if I don't?

00:21.250 --> 00:22.440
You'll be fired.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.750
I should probably say goodbye.

00:29.810 --> 00:31.220
I'm glad you're here.

00:31.220 --> 00:33.230
I said I loved you,
and you didn't say it back.

00:33.230 --> 00:36.040
And I said it was fine,
but it wasn't.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.080
I don't want you to go.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.050
But I have to.

00:40.050 --> 00:43.880
If continuing this pregnancy
means I lose you, then we end it.

00:45.340 --> 00:47.190
I'm having this baby.

00:47.190 --> 00:50.310
We're having this baby.

Letting Go

01:09.570 --> 01:11.880
- Up and at 'em.
- What?

01:11.880 --> 01:15.610
It's a beautiful day --
you, me, Jamie, the river court.

01:15.610 --> 01:17.780
Come on.
Let's go, chop-chop.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.010
I thought I'd go shoot a
round with Nate and Jamie.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.320
Think you'll be okay?

01:35.320 --> 01:37.340
Honey, you don't have to check
up on me every five minutes, 

01:37.340 --> 01:39.110
even though I do love you for it.

01:39.110 --> 01:40.570
I know.

01:40.570 --> 01:43.990
I guess it's just 'cause, well, I'm
the only one who knows.

01:43.990 --> 01:45.080
I know. I know.

01:45.080 --> 01:48.350
I should tell Brooke -- the
whole "no secrets" thing.

01:48.350 --> 01:49.790
Maybe I will.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.080
You go play.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.930
Okay.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.350
I love you.

01:57.350 --> 02:01.080
Yeah, I sort of like you, too.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.420
It's kind of quiet in here.

02:33.420 --> 02:36.100
Yeah, mia had a couple of
gigs left on the schedule, 

02:36.100 --> 02:38.870
but the label really
loves that new song I sent.

02:38.870 --> 02:40.150
Another one?

02:40.150 --> 02:41.300
Geez, that's girl's
been a writing machine

02:41.300 --> 02:42.580
since she hooked up with chase.

02:42.580 --> 02:45.090
True, but the song
they're really crazy about

02:45.090 --> 02:47.770
is "Feel This"
by Hayley James Scott.

02:47.770 --> 02:50.840
- Dude, you totally thudded me!
- Right.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.460
I'm sorry. I didn't know I wasn't
supposed to be promoting your career.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.490
Well, it depends on what they said.

02:55.490 --> 02:58.510
Uh, they said...

02:58.510 --> 02:59.950
They want more.

02:59.950 --> 03:03.510
And they're really excited
about the new promotional angle.

03:03.510 --> 03:06.120
Which is what, exactly?

03:07.490 --> 03:09.110
The singing maverick teacher

03:09.110 --> 03:13.120
that punched out the principal
and slept with a student.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.600
I never hit anyone.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.860
And that other thing
was seven years ago.

03:16.860 --> 03:17.900
I was a tutor.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.010
Oh, okay.

03:19.010 --> 03:21.710
Sorry, I had to stretch it a little bit.

03:21.990 --> 03:24.470
How's the new stuff coming?

03:26.180 --> 03:27.310
Why?

03:27.310 --> 03:30.340
'Cause I keep thinking I should
be in third-period english

03:30.340 --> 03:32.940
and wondering how my kids are doing.

03:33.700 --> 03:37.120
# I keep thinking of you #

03:37.120 --> 03:38.850
Congratulations.

03:38.850 --> 03:41.280
You set a new record for failing.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.030
We didn't fail. You failed.
Bring back Miss Scott.

03:45.030 --> 03:48.740
You -- detention
in my office, um...

03:49.380 --> 03:52.780
Here's how little you know--
I'm not even in this class.

03:53.770 --> 03:55.680
You shouldn't be, either.

04:00.190 --> 04:01.930
Anyone else?

04:01.930 --> 04:03.070
He's got a point.

04:03.070 --> 04:06.040
Maybe we wouldn't be failing
if you hadn't fired our teacher.

04:06.040 --> 04:09.730
Watch it, or you'll be joining
your friend, Mr. No-Name.

04:09.730 --> 04:13.140
All I'm saying is that either
we all got instantly dumber, 

04:13.140 --> 04:15.830
or you should have been
a little bit smarter.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.010
I'll see myself out.

04:24.270 --> 04:26.350
We need to teach Rimkus a lesson.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.640
And just to be clear,
by "lesson, "

04:27.640 --> 04:31.300
I don't mean throw on a ski mask
and beat the crap out of her.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.470
Pack a bag.
We are taking a road trip.

04:35.470 --> 04:37.400
I'm sleeping.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.660
No, what you're doing is
feeling sorry for yourself

04:39.660 --> 04:41.230
because your girl broke up with you, 

04:41.230 --> 04:43.520
because I've been
doing me the same thing.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.580
Now pack that bag.

04:44.580 --> 04:45.840
Dude, I'm sleeping.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.140
You can sleep in the car.

04:47.140 --> 04:48.910
Now, you want to ask
where we going?

04:48.910 --> 04:50.340
Where are we going?

04:50.340 --> 04:52.460
To fix your broken heart.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.800
Now move your
feeling-sorry-for-yourself ass.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.160
- Let's go.
- Hey, man!

04:56.160 --> 04:58.570
- Let's go!
- No!

05:02.420 --> 05:06.450
# I've been thinking of you a lot #

05:06.450 --> 05:08.130
Nice!

05:08.130 --> 05:09.640
All right, now go in for a lay-up.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.210
Piece of cake.

05:13.650 --> 05:15.430
- Nice!
- Nice.

05:15.820 --> 05:17.050
Kid's growing up fast.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.620
Tell me about it.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.190
He's been asking a lot
of questions lately.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.440
All of a sudden we're
supposed to be the grown-ups

05:22.440 --> 05:23.960
that have all the answers.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.200
Birds and the bees already?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.880
That would be easier.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.240
No, they're actually, um--
they're about Keith.

05:30.240 --> 05:34.400
Ever since Dan admitted to
Jamie that he killed Keith, 

05:34.400 --> 05:36.320
join the club.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.260
Actually, I was thinking
maybe you could help.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.710
He feels bad he never got to meet Keith.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.890
You knew him better than anybody.

05:43.890 --> 05:45.740
I thought maybe you could talk to him.

05:49.910 --> 05:52.100
You know what, I've got a better idea.

06:07.020 --> 06:08.820
Did you come to say goodbye?

06:08.820 --> 06:12.870
Well, I was thinking maybe
this didn't have to be goodbye.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.540
What does that mean?

06:14.540 --> 06:16.080
You said you didn't
want to be a footnote

06:16.080 --> 06:18.590
in someone else's love story.

06:20.190 --> 06:23.960
Well, maybe it's time we
write our own epic love story.

06:25.450 --> 06:28.980
This time tomorrow, we could be
walking on a beach in Malibu.

06:32.310 --> 06:34.750
But what about Sam?

06:35.130 --> 06:37.330
I can't leave her here.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.890
Yeah, I thought you'd say that.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.620
And I agree.

06:45.620 --> 06:47.330
Julian.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.060
Look, I know you're gonna come up

06:49.060 --> 06:50.840
with a Million reasons
why you shouldn't.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.400
So I'm just gonna give you
this one why you should.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.630
I love you...

06:56.630 --> 06:58.570
Brooke Davis.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.720
Come with me.

07:02.190 --> 07:05.480
# You're on my mind #

07:09.620 --> 07:11.060
Guess what.

07:11.060 --> 07:13.630
Your ex-boyfriend just asked
Sam and I to go with him to L.A.

07:13.630 --> 07:15.090
Tonight.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.010
Jake?

07:17.010 --> 07:18.870
This isn't funny.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.740
I mean, that's a really big deal.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.330
It is good, though, right?

07:24.330 --> 07:27.550
No. It would be
ridiculous to go with him.

07:27.550 --> 07:30.290
I -- I have a
store to fill.

07:30.290 --> 07:32.820
My friends are here. My life is here.

07:33.070 --> 07:34.840
And what about Sam?

07:34.840 --> 07:38.630
You know, my parents did the Same
thing to me when I was in high school.

07:38.630 --> 07:41.180
When they left, I was
going out with Lucas.

07:41.180 --> 07:44.300
And now he's the father of your baby.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.020
And you're pregnant, and
I'm your maid of honor.

07:47.020 --> 07:49.390
How could I leave you?

07:50.740 --> 07:52.230
Brooke, I'm gonna be fine, okay?

07:52.230 --> 07:53.980
You should go.

07:53.980 --> 07:56.170
We came back here for
each other, P. Sawyer.

07:56.170 --> 07:58.280
Hon, no.

07:58.280 --> 08:01.370
You came back here for me,
and I love you for that.

08:01.370 --> 08:04.730
But I want you to be happy!

08:04.730 --> 08:06.750
This is what you want, right?

08:06.750 --> 08:09.240
I want more time to
figure out what I want.

08:10.220 --> 08:13.070
Do you remember how
unhappy you were in L.A.?

08:13.070 --> 08:16.300
Well, yeah, 'cause I was alone, 

08:16.300 --> 08:17.750
because the boy that I loved

08:17.750 --> 08:21.410
asked me to be with him, and I said no.

08:21.990 --> 08:25.080
So just think about that, all right?

08:25.080 --> 08:28.820
And whatever you decide to do, I
want you to know I love you.

08:29.490 --> 08:32.370
And what if it doesn't work out?

08:34.559 --> 08:36.570
What if it does?

08:43.520 --> 08:45.410
Where are we?

08:47.730 --> 08:49.230
When I was your age, Jamie, 

08:49.230 --> 08:52.450
this used to be my favorite
place in the whole world.

08:52.450 --> 08:54.160
Why?

08:54.990 --> 08:57.580
Well, this is your
great-uncle Keith's auto shop.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.690
Well, the guy that
owns it now --

08:58.690 --> 09:01.220
he gave me a key so I
can come whenever I want.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.270
Cool.

09:03.690 --> 09:05.630
Hey, whoa, uh, be careful.

09:07.010 --> 09:09.130
This was a great idea, luke.

09:09.870 --> 09:12.410
Yeah, well, the Mustang
needs a tune-up anyway.

09:12.410 --> 09:13.980
All right, I'll pull it in.

09:13.980 --> 09:16.610
Hey, Nate, uh,
I wanted to ask you...

09:18.660 --> 09:20.150
when Hayley was pregnant, 

09:20.150 --> 09:23.460
did you ever worry about all
the things that could go wrong?

09:23.460 --> 09:24.920
Of course.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.350
Just Stay off the internet.

09:27.350 --> 09:28.990
It's full of horror stories.

09:28.990 --> 09:30.510
Hayley OKed up one of
her symptoms one time

09:30.510 --> 09:32.910
and was convinced jamiwas
gonna be born with two heads.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.830
You know what the doctor told us?

09:39.300 --> 09:42.440
Childbirth is the ordinary miracle.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.570
You can't believe it happens every day.

09:48.140 --> 09:50.770
Jamie, do you want to help
me pull the Mustang in?

09:50.770 --> 09:54.340
- Cool. Are we gonna work on it?
- Of course.

09:54.340 --> 09:56.170
- Can I help?
- Yeah, come on.

09:56.170 --> 09:57.490
Sweet!

10:11.410 --> 10:14.170
Hey. Did you get
one of those for me?

10:14.170 --> 10:15.770
Thanks. I need it.

10:15.770 --> 10:17.630
I've been so exhausted lately.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.470
Yeah, that's 'cause
you've been depressed.

10:19.470 --> 10:22.650
But tonight, all that's
gonna change, my brother.

10:22.650 --> 10:24.810
Tonight, no sleeping --

10:24.810 --> 10:27.440
Well, unless sleeping
with horny coeds counts.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.590
Big college party tonight, baby.

10:29.590 --> 10:32.390
- What college?
- Your alma mater.

10:32.390 --> 10:34.490
What? Skills, Gigi goes there.

10:34.490 --> 10:35.530
I know

10:35.530 --> 10:37.670
You just texted her and told
her you was rolling through.

10:37.670 --> 10:38.680
No, I didn't.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.070
And she texted you back and said
how excited she was to see you.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.520
Dude, where's my phone?

10:42.520 --> 10:44.300
Bam!

10:45.340 --> 10:47.160
"Your ass is so fine"?

10:47.420 --> 10:48.570
Thank you.

10:48.570 --> 10:50.680
No, I mean you texted that to her?

10:50.680 --> 10:53.120
It's all good, man. She liked it.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.850
Gigi's the reason I lost
Millie in the first place.

10:55.850 --> 10:59.180
No, you're the reason you lost
Millie in the first place.

10:59.180 --> 11:03.520
Now it's time for you to have some
wild-ass, no-strings-attached sex.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.180
And Gigi is the one for that.

11:05.180 --> 11:06.690
Turn the car around.

11:06.690 --> 11:08.210
Mouth, look.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.560
You're not the only one
that needed this trip.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.590
Do it for me, okay?

11:14.220 --> 11:17.910
The second you want to bounce,
I promise, we out of there.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.490
"You dirty little freak"?

11:22.490 --> 11:24.580
That one came from her.

11:30.610 --> 11:33.080
Sam, Jack, what are you guys doing here?

11:33.080 --> 11:35.180
Oh, we wanted to see you.

11:35.430 --> 11:37.330
How did you get in?

11:38.440 --> 11:40.470
I'm good with windows.

11:40.470 --> 11:42.440
Why aren't you guys in school?

11:42.440 --> 11:43.920
Rimkus kicked us out.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.000
Sorry, but I can't have two students
in my house during school hours.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.460
Good, 'cause it's not just us two.

12:07.290 --> 12:10.080
Okay, so, does anybody
want to tell me

12:10.080 --> 12:12.050
why an entire
english-literature class is

12:12.050 --> 12:15.370
in my "I wish you would have called so
I could straighten up first" living room?

12:15.370 --> 12:18.300
You ever see
"Dead Poets Society"?

12:18.300 --> 12:19.920
Oh, my God, who died?

12:19.920 --> 12:22.990
We took a stand for a
popular teacher -- you.

12:22.990 --> 12:27.650
You guys, I'm really touched, but
Principal Rimkus is gonna lose her mind

12:27.650 --> 12:29.800
if you don't get your butts
back behind those desks.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.160
We're not learning anything there.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.310
She just she just handed
back our papers on "Catch-22, "

12:33.310 --> 12:35.060
and we all got D's and F'S.

12:35.060 --> 12:36.600
We want you back.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.740
I feel your pain. I really do.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.780
But just think about
it from her perspective.

12:40.780 --> 12:43.340
Walking out on her isn't gonna
make her respect you any more.

12:43.340 --> 12:44.450
Who cares?

12:44.450 --> 12:47.190
I mean, nobody likes her.

12:47.190 --> 12:50.150
She doesn't even know our
names, and she's a total bitch.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.510
Hey, watch your language in my...

12:51.510 --> 12:52.580
house, missy.

12:52.580 --> 12:56.520
- Listen, I really appreciate you guys' initiative and your heart.
- Thank you.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.950
But this is not the right thing to do.

12:58.950 --> 13:00.740
You have to go back to school.

13:00.740 --> 13:04.870
We all know Rimkus screwed you,
and she's wrong.

13:04.870 --> 13:09.550
I mean, look at the
difference you made for me...

13:09.550 --> 13:10.960
for quentin?

13:10.960 --> 13:15.750
Sam, a teacher doesn't have to be your
friend or even somebody that you like.

13:15.750 --> 13:16.930
In fact, out in the real world, 

13:16.930 --> 13:18.710
you meet a lot of people that
you're gonna disagree with, 

13:18.710 --> 13:21.600
and you have to learn to work with them.

13:22.180 --> 13:24.130
Okay, um...

13:24.600 --> 13:29.600
how about we disagree with you
and you learn to work with us?

13:29.600 --> 13:33.860
Because we're not leaving here
until you teach us something.

13:47.550 --> 13:49.530
Man, I miss school.

13:49.530 --> 13:51.100
I see why, too.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.980
What's up, little mama?

13:53.980 --> 13:56.400
Ooh, look at this one.
What's up, silky?

13:56.400 --> 13:57.960
Hey, yo, I'm gonna holler at you later.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.270
I got you.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.280
Hey, look, man, I'm about
to go fix my broken heart.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.910
I suggest you do the Same.

14:09.910 --> 14:13.510
- You seen Gigi around here anywhere?
- Yep.

14:13.990 --> 14:16.440
...28, 29, 30!

14:16.440 --> 14:18.320
Mouth!

14:18.850 --> 14:20.450
- Oh, I loved your texts.
- Hey.

14:20.970 --> 14:22.530
We got to do a keg stand!

14:22.530 --> 14:24.270
Gigi, it's still light outside.

14:24.270 --> 14:26.420
I know, but not for long. Bottoms up.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.500
1, 2...

14:28.500 --> 14:30.130
3, 4...

14:30.130 --> 14:32.470
Let's go, Mouth!
You got this, baby!

14:39.100 --> 14:40.440
Got it!

14:40.440 --> 14:41.500
All right.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.180
There you go. Good job, Jamie.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.810
- All right.
- This is fun.

14:46.810 --> 14:47.900
Plus, if you can fix cars, 

14:47.900 --> 14:50.970
you're gonna score major points
with the ladies, like Miss Lauren.

14:50.970 --> 14:53.530
I thought we weren't
gonna talk about that.

14:53.530 --> 14:55.450
Oh, that's right. I'm
sorry. You moved on.

14:55.450 --> 14:59.880
What's the, uh -- what's the
piano girl's name -- Madison?

14:59.880 --> 15:01.580
Dad.

15:02.450 --> 15:03.510
You know, Jamie, it's okay.

15:03.510 --> 15:06.140
My uncle Keith used to tease
me all the time about Peyton.

15:06.140 --> 15:07.520
Really? Why?

15:07.520 --> 15:10.920
Well, it's just what guys do
when they work on cars together.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.520
They tease each other
about girls, you know?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.570
It's like your dad here.

15:15.570 --> 15:19.370
You know, he had to trick your mom into
liking him by pretending he needed tutoring.

15:19.370 --> 15:20.550
I wasn't pretending.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.950
I was dumb as a post, Jamie.

15:24.100 --> 15:27.820
Hey, whatever happened
to Aunt Lindsey?

15:30.480 --> 15:32.890
Put the spark plug back in, you goof.

15:34.490 --> 15:36.260
All right, buddy, you ready? One, two...

15:36.260 --> 15:38.130
three!

15:38.130 --> 15:41.020
I... there!

15:43.920 --> 15:45.410
Come on, boys.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.120
Drink up, baby.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.380
Okay, sexy city.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.990
That's yours.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.030
Drink it!

16:03.620 --> 16:05.310
Having fun, Marvin?

16:11.770 --> 16:13.700
So, next we have orr.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.070
Now, how would you
describe this character?

16:15.070 --> 16:16.550
Anyone.

16:17.740 --> 16:19.050
Jack.

16:19.050 --> 16:22.500
Uh, well, he's always
trying to crash his plane.

16:22.500 --> 16:26.370
Um, it makes him seem kind of
stupid or nuts or suicidal.

16:26.370 --> 16:28.140
But is he?

16:28.610 --> 16:31.620
No, he's, uh,
working on a plan to escape.

16:31.620 --> 16:32.830
Which means?

16:32.830 --> 16:36.410
He's the smartest, the least crazy.

16:36.410 --> 16:39.150
Yes! That's it!

16:39.840 --> 16:41.410
Did you read the book?

16:41.410 --> 16:42.730
Saw the movie.

16:42.730 --> 16:46.440
So, do we see how this
relates to our theme now?

16:46.810 --> 16:51.040
Yeah, Catch-22 -- it's another contradiction
on how messed up the world can be.

16:52.260 --> 16:55.760
If Rimkus had made it this interesting, we
wouldn't have all gotten F's.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.750
You think?

17:05.339 --> 17:06.940
It's open.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.650
Did you come by to beg me to stay?

17:12.300 --> 17:14.359
Brooke said you asked her to go to L.A.

17:14.359 --> 17:15.930
Did she?

17:16.599 --> 17:18.500
I really hope you're serious, 

17:18.500 --> 17:22.040
because she hasn't been serious
about anybody in a long time.

17:22.660 --> 17:25.250
You haven't trusted me
since the day I came to town.

17:25.250 --> 17:28.240
Because you looked like
you had an ax to grind.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.600
Maybe I did.

17:31.220 --> 17:34.430
But somewhere along the
line, this place changed me.

17:34.430 --> 17:36.370
Brooke changed me.

17:36.370 --> 17:38.510
I told Brooke I love her because I do.

17:38.510 --> 17:41.780
I invited Sam because I
want us to be a family.

17:41.780 --> 17:43.930
I wouldn't have it any other way.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.820
All right.

17:47.820 --> 17:49.520
For the record, I do believe you.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.990
So...

17:51.450 --> 17:53.020
I hope it works out.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.600
Thank you.

17:57.690 --> 18:01.680
Wait, she didn't happen to mention
which way she's leaning, by any chance?

18:01.680 --> 18:03.040
No.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.840
No, she's not going, or, no, she
didn't mention it?

18:05.840 --> 18:08.830
I really have no idea
what she's gonna say.

18:08.830 --> 18:11.230
But I do know this
-- if Brooke says no, 

18:11.230 --> 18:14.020
it won't be because she
doesn't care for you.

18:14.020 --> 18:17.560
She has been very protective
of her heart for a long time.

18:18.010 --> 18:19.640
She's afraid.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.300
L.A.?

18:28.060 --> 18:30.790
- That was fast.
- I know. It's crazy, right?

18:30.790 --> 18:32.510
Maybe, maybe not.

18:32.510 --> 18:34.420
I guess that means
owen's out of the picture?

18:34.420 --> 18:37.530
Uh, owen had a problem with Sam.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.100
Or maybe you just didn't let him in.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.810
So he let himself into my assistant?

18:47.350 --> 18:50.810
You know, when you left for New York,
sometimes I wish I'd gone after you.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.740
So you're saying I should go?

18:52.740 --> 18:54.170
I don't know.

18:54.170 --> 18:56.050
I mean, I didn't go.

18:56.050 --> 18:58.030
And eventually I found Mia,
and she's been great.

18:58.030 --> 18:59.570
So you're saying I should stay.

18:59.570 --> 19:02.890
I guess I'm trying to say you'll
always be able to find someone, Brooke.

19:02.890 --> 19:06.760
- I mean, come on. Look at you.
- Thank you.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.060
But you remind me of
that Springsteen line --

19:09.830 --> 19:13.160
"There were ghosts in the eyes
of all the boys you sent away."

19:13.950 --> 19:16.170
Figure out what
you want, Brooke.

19:16.170 --> 19:21.500
But until you let someone
in, you'll always be alone.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.470
I saw the mass exodus
pass my window.

19:36.470 --> 19:38.730
Back to school now.

19:39.820 --> 19:41.320
You can't suspend us all.

19:41.320 --> 19:45.410
No, but we can start with
you, Mr. Daniels. Who's next?

19:46.690 --> 19:50.270
Okay, can I speak with
you in my kitchen, please?

19:53.810 --> 19:56.790
Uh, I realize I'm probably in
no position to give you advice.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.980
Last I checked, you
had no position at all.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.260
See? That's --
that's it right there, 

20:00.260 --> 20:02.400
the way that you speak to me
and the way you speak to them.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.600
These are not third-graders.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.710
They're young adults.

20:04.710 --> 20:05.730
And?

20:05.730 --> 20:07.860
And you have to treat them that way.

20:07.860 --> 20:12.010
If you give them a class they want
to be in, they will come to you.

20:13.790 --> 20:17.210
Okay, you guys, third-period
english lit is over.

20:17.210 --> 20:19.060
I'm serious, and it's
not in my dining room.

20:19.060 --> 20:20.840
It's back at school.

20:20.840 --> 20:24.050
Tomorrow, I expect all of you to be
back in Principal Rimkus' classroom.

20:24.050 --> 20:26.810
It's the right thing
to do, and you know it.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.780
You left some things in my classroom.

20:31.780 --> 20:34.570
I'd like them gone
by the end of the day.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.290
Man, Marvin McFadden,
you disappoint me.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.600
College
girls -- good.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.880
Alcohol
-- good.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.600
Pajamas
-- good.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.490
Where the hell is your head at?

21:18.460 --> 21:20.840
So, Jack, this wasn't
your worst idea ever.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.050
Kids always like an
excuse to blow off school.

21:23.050 --> 21:25.920
Yes, but it was still a nice thing
you did for me, and I appreciate it.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.180
Eh, you know.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.880
Well, it's just payback.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.920
I mean, you took the
fall when I shoplifted.

21:34.410 --> 21:35.710
Thank you.

21:36.580 --> 21:38.210
Yeah.

21:38.990 --> 21:40.670
You, too.

21:43.090 --> 21:47.870
Okay, you two, thank you so much
for staying behind and cleaning up, 

21:47.870 --> 21:49.980
but you have to go
back to school, also.

21:49.980 --> 21:51.210
Not me.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.890
I'm suspended.

21:54.340 --> 21:55.660
Go!

21:59.290 --> 22:01.070
Bye, Miss Scott.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.800
Hey, Uncle Lucas, who am I?

22:12.790 --> 22:14.940
Wow, it's mini-Keith.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.930
Uncle Keith must have been so cool.

22:17.930 --> 22:22.430
Yeah, well, not just fohis
unique sense of style.

22:23.830 --> 22:25.370
Come here.

22:27.290 --> 22:30.280
You know, your great-uncle
Keith was the best guy I knew.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.130
He was always good to me and my mom.

22:33.130 --> 22:35.790
He always helped me out
whenever I was struggling.

22:35.790 --> 22:39.020
Sounds a lot like you,
Uncle Lucas.

22:40.740 --> 22:42.590
I don't know about that.

22:43.140 --> 22:46.420
What I do know is that he
loved me and he was proud of me, 

22:46.420 --> 22:50.420
just like I love you
and I'm proud of you.

22:52.250 --> 22:53.540
Maybe you're right.

22:57.430 --> 22:59.360
How about you fire her up?

22:59.360 --> 23:02.360
- Me? Really?
- Yeah.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.260
All right, Jamie!

23:20.570 --> 23:22.680
Double "G" is looking for you.

23:24.460 --> 23:27.150
Things were so much less
complicated in college.

23:27.150 --> 23:28.560
How so?

23:28.560 --> 23:29.920
I remember walking these halls, 

23:29.920 --> 23:32.610
hoping that someday
I'd be a sportscaster...

23:32.610 --> 23:34.400
Okay, you got that.

23:34.400 --> 23:37.000
That I'd have a full life, good friends.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.510
You definitely got that.

23:39.510 --> 23:41.030
And every night before bed, 

23:41.030 --> 23:44.480
I'd wish that someday
I'd find the right girl, 

23:44.480 --> 23:46.790
a good girl, you know?

23:46.790 --> 23:50.280
Someone who loved me as
much as I loved her back.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.500
I don't suppose that
girl's name is Gigi.

23:57.600 --> 24:02.020
Okay, I made you a promise. Let's go.

24:02.020 --> 24:03.690
You okay to drive?

24:03.690 --> 24:05.150
Dude, I haven't had a drink for hours.

24:05.150 --> 24:07.590
I've never been so sober.

24:15.060 --> 24:17.670
What, is your next line
inspired by "Twilight"?

24:19.880 --> 24:22.050
There is no next line.

24:22.050 --> 24:24.240
Have you looked around?

24:24.270 --> 24:26.900
I might as well go back
to selling coffee here.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.820
Oh, gee, that seems
like a lifetime... ago.

24:29.820 --> 24:31.760
What's going on with you?

24:34.560 --> 24:41.410
everybody else has families
and kids and careers, and...

24:41.410 --> 24:43.760
I have this.

24:44.910 --> 24:48.090
Brooke, don't sell yourself short.

24:48.090 --> 24:49.360
You've got all of us.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.390
You've got a godson
who loves you.

24:51.390 --> 24:53.780
And the reason why I came by today

24:53.780 --> 24:56.040
was to tell you about something
really rare that I saw.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.600
Guess what it was.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.240
A unicorn.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.620
I've always wanted
to see a unicorn.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.980
Even more rare than that.

25:04.980 --> 25:08.600
It was a group of students
who wanted to study more.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.210
They came over to my
house this afternoon, 

25:10.210 --> 25:14.740
during school, and guess
who was their leader. Sam.

25:14.740 --> 25:16.070
It's amazing how far she's come

25:16.070 --> 25:19.390
since I found her sleeping
in the backseat of a car.

25:19.390 --> 25:21.450
She's socialized.

25:21.450 --> 25:22.700
She's a solid student.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.720
She's writing.

25:24.720 --> 25:27.630
I think she has a budding
romance with Jack happening, too.

25:27.630 --> 25:30.610
And they stayed behind to clean
up the mess after everybody left.

25:30.610 --> 25:33.460
Well, that's a lot more than she did

25:33.460 --> 25:38.230
when she trashed this
place and Peyton's gown.

25:38.230 --> 25:39.470
That's why I wanted
to tell you --

25:39.470 --> 25:45.000
because you should be proud
of her and of yourself.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.650
All that girl needed
was a stable environment, 

25:47.650 --> 25:49.710
and you gave it to her.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.640
Yeah thanks.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.740
Oh, you again.

26:04.740 --> 26:06.110
Oh, no, no, don't let me
interrupt your flow.

26:06.110 --> 26:07.630
I want you to keep writing.

26:07.630 --> 26:09.220
Oh, yeah?

26:09.220 --> 26:11.460
I loved this story you wrote.

26:11.460 --> 26:15.470
My only note would be--
More, please.

26:15.470 --> 26:18.310
Sam, you have what most
writers would kill for.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.770
A troubled childhood?

26:19.770 --> 26:21.430
A voice -- you have
stories to tell.

26:21.430 --> 26:23.630
All you need is a little structure.

26:24.210 --> 26:25.790
Thank you.

26:25.790 --> 26:28.700
Can I still call you
when you're in L.A.?

26:29.490 --> 26:32.920
I totally meant it
when I invited you, too.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.490
Invited me where?

26:35.490 --> 26:39.450
Uh, I gave Brooke two plane tickets...

26:39.450 --> 26:42.060
for you guys to come with me to L.A.

26:42.700 --> 26:45.160
- When?
- Tonight.

26:50.330 --> 26:52.620
I guess she didn't tell you.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.230
Nope.

27:00.070 --> 27:03.250
Geez, I thought Brooke
was in a dark place.

27:03.250 --> 27:06.020
Oh, God, I didn't realize
how late it d gotten.

27:06.020 --> 27:08.170
Got a little carried away drawing.

27:08.170 --> 27:09.540
What's up?

27:09.540 --> 27:11.680
I don't think I've been honest with you.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.910
One of my classes came
over to my house today, 

27:14.910 --> 27:16.970
and I realized that, 

27:16.970 --> 27:18.700
um, the reason I've
been dragging my heels

27:18.700 --> 27:20.590
when it comes to
committing to my next record

27:20.590 --> 27:24.360
is that I really love teaching.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.510
Well, you may feel different

27:26.510 --> 27:32.160
when you're teaching to an entire
stadium of students with your music.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.980
And besides, you still have a
really great student in mia.

27:35.980 --> 27:38.020
You did a wonderful
thing in discovering her, 

27:38.020 --> 27:40.960
and it makes me feel really good to know

27:40.960 --> 27:43.620
that you're always gonna
be there to guide her.

27:44.360 --> 27:45.900
Well, so will you.

27:45.900 --> 27:49.730
Well, yeah, but, I
mean, when the baby comes, 

27:49.730 --> 27:52.150
I'm not gonna be around as much.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.320
We're still a team, though, right?

27:55.320 --> 27:56.800
Of course.

28:02.790 --> 28:06.070
Man, these college girls are nasty.

28:06.070 --> 28:08.120
Can I ask you something?

28:08.120 --> 28:11.240
How are you dealing with
this so well so fast?

28:11.240 --> 28:13.140
I'm dying here.

28:13.660 --> 28:15.250
It still hurts, bro.

28:15.250 --> 28:17.070
I mean, it always does.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.290
But you know what I do?

28:18.290 --> 28:20.000
You freaky text and watch porn?

28:20.000 --> 28:26.040
No, I just tell myself that if deb
is the one, then she'll come back.

28:26.040 --> 28:32.010
And if not, then I'm all good because I
know she's still out there -- the right one.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.110
I just haven't met her yet.

28:34.110 --> 28:37.440
You once told me if a girl
dumps you, she's not the one.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.460
Maybe Nathan's mom
just wasn't the one.

28:43.080 --> 28:46.340
Okay, sorry.
That sounded weird.

28:46.740 --> 28:49.860
P-pull over.
It's my turn to drive.

29:25.140 --> 29:27.380
So, I might be moving to L.A.

29:27.380 --> 29:28.520
Since when?

29:28.520 --> 29:31.100
Uh, since Julian
invited Brooke and me.

29:33.190 --> 29:34.720
Don't freak out.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.400
When would you be going?

29:38.810 --> 29:40.610
Tonight.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.500
Well, that'll be pretty cool.

29:44.220 --> 29:45.380
Right?

29:47.100 --> 29:48.250
Yeah.

29:48.250 --> 29:53.580
Listen, I know this sucks for us,
but I really want to do this for Brooke.

29:53.580 --> 29:56.380
Jack, she's done so much for me.

29:56.380 --> 29:59.170
Then I guess you should go.

30:01.030 --> 30:03.350
Better start packing.

30:05.490 --> 30:07.030
Sam.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.640
I just...

30:16.640 --> 30:23.530
wanted to do that, um, in case I
didn't ever get the chance... to.

30:37.280 --> 30:40.330
I'm sad I never got to
meet Uncle Keith.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.070
Yeah, I'm sad about that, too, buddy.

30:46.070 --> 30:49.210
And I'm sorry about
what Grandpa Dan did.

30:49.210 --> 30:52.970
Yeah. We all are, Jamie.

30:53.860 --> 30:56.620
Am I still allowed to
miss Grandpa Dan?

31:05.030 --> 31:08.580
Yeah, Jamie. Yeah.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.280
I like it here.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.700
You bring something
broken, and you fix it up.

31:32.350 --> 31:35.640
I always liked it here, too.

31:47.330 --> 31:48.780
Mouth, wake up.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.890
- Where are we?
- At Millie's place.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.870
What? How?

31:57.300 --> 32:01.930
Well, maybe the texting I was doing
before was actually with Brooke, 

32:01.930 --> 32:05.390
and maybe Brooke just hooked
me up with Millie's address.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.590
Why?

32:07.590 --> 32:10.980
I told you this morning we was
going to fix your broken heart.

32:10.980 --> 32:14.290
So, go fix it.

32:33.790 --> 32:35.290
Oh, sorry.

32:35.290 --> 32:38.080
Um, I just came by to
pick up some of my stuff.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.030
Pulling an all-nighter?

32:45.630 --> 32:49.170
your students walked across
town to be taught by you.

32:49.170 --> 32:52.160
It's hard to get them to walk
down the hall for most classes.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.260
Yeah.

32:54.990 --> 32:56.650
Well...

32:57.350 --> 32:59.290
would you ever consider...

33:00.060 --> 33:04.650
I love teaching, but I would never
sacrifice my beliefs to do it.

33:04.650 --> 33:10.500
You fired me right here in front of
all my kids just because you could.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.950
So, congratulations, Principal Rimkus.

33:12.950 --> 33:17.560
You made a good teacher ntt wa to teach
and good students not want to learn.

33:19.310 --> 33:21.170
You be proud of that.

33:38.720 --> 33:42.200
I wish that I could get over
things as easily as Jamie.

33:42.200 --> 33:46.150
- Well, it's easier when you're 5.
- Yeah.

33:46.150 --> 33:50.350
You know, when I see
you with Jamie, I think, 

33:50.350 --> 33:52.240
"if my little brother
can be such a good father, 

33:52.240 --> 33:55.800
"then maybe I'll be okay, too."

33:55.800 --> 33:57.890
Of course you will.

33:58.850 --> 34:02.640
And besides, you got a hell of a
head start being raised by Keith.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.740
Look at today.

34:03.740 --> 34:05.930
You're already doing it with Jamie.

34:05.930 --> 34:07.250
You'll be great.

34:07.250 --> 34:10.739
Thanks.

34:13.150 --> 34:18.540
I needed a day like today
-- service and repair.

34:19.520 --> 34:22.310
Service and repair.

34:37.610 --> 34:39.449
Marvin.

34:39.449 --> 34:41.060
Hi.

34:42.010 --> 34:44.219
What are you doing here?

34:44.219 --> 34:46.960
I was just in the neighborhood.

34:47.909 --> 34:50.239
Actually, that's not true.

34:51.510 --> 34:53.670
I'm... I'm here because
I can't live without you, 

34:53.670 --> 34:57.840
Millicent Huxtable, and
I don't want to anymore.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.580
And I'm sorry.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.930
- What are you doing?
- Julian told me he invited you to L.A.

35:23.930 --> 35:25.510
So I packed your bag.

35:25.510 --> 35:27.170
No, he didn't invite me.

35:27.170 --> 35:29.700
He invited us.

35:31.780 --> 35:33.460
Hang on.

35:35.370 --> 35:38.650
I packed my stuff, too. I just
didn't know if you wanted me to come.

35:38.650 --> 35:40.570
Sam, you have school.

35:40.570 --> 35:42.420
They have schools in L.A.

35:42.420 --> 35:45.660
You have Jack.
You have a life here.

35:45.660 --> 35:47.660
This is a stable environment.

35:47.660 --> 35:49.320
I'm a survivor.
I'll roll with it.

35:49.320 --> 35:52.410
You shouldn't have to
keep rolling with anything.

35:52.410 --> 35:56.030
That was the whole point of
you coming to live with me.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.720
He loves you. He's a great guy.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.260
He wants us all to try it out together.

36:03.260 --> 36:04.590
Don't you get it?

36:04.590 --> 36:06.470
Most people dream of this moment.

36:06.470 --> 36:08.340
Why aren't we already out the door?

36:08.340 --> 36:11.210
Because most people don't
leave their lives behind

36:11.210 --> 36:12.970
to run off to California
with someone

36:12.970 --> 36:15.080
that they have only known for a month, 

36:15.080 --> 36:16.900
Sam --
that's why.

36:16.900 --> 36:23.190
Brooke, you're a good peon, a cool
designer, and a kick-ass mom, but...

36:24.120 --> 36:26.330
Sometimes you're your own biggest enemy.

36:26.330 --> 36:27.550
You're 22.

36:27.550 --> 36:29.500
You have your whole life ahead of you.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.960
You have this awesome dude
at the airport who loves you!

36:32.960 --> 36:35.640
God, you have to go. You have to.

36:35.790 --> 36:39.070
# I want to rock 'n' roll #

36:40.940 --> 36:44.000
# I want to give my soul #

36:46.530 --> 36:49.560
# I'm wanting to believe #

36:50.050 --> 36:55.620
# I'm not too old #

36:57.500 --> 37:00.810
# Don't want to make it up #

37:03.050 --> 37:06.270
# Don't want to let you down #

37:08.760 --> 37:11.980
# I want to fly away #

37:11.980 --> 37:16.580
# I'm stuck on the ground #

37:14.590 --> 37:16.170
Where's Sam?

37:16.660 --> 37:18.700
She's not coming.

37:20.880 --> 37:23.230
You're not coming.

37:24.120 --> 37:29.200
I have a life here,
and Sam has her life here.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.690
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

37:31.690 --> 37:34.500
And it doesn't--
I mean --

37:34.500 --> 37:36.730
Brooke. Brooke.

37:36.730 --> 37:38.630
It's okay.

37:40.910 --> 37:45.260
If this were a movie,
it would end different.

37:45.260 --> 37:47.800
But life's not a movie.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.880
I guess that makes two
films that didn't work out.

37:52.060 --> 37:56.750
Final boarding call for
Flight 406 to Los Angeles.

38:01.860 --> 38:04.920
Goodbye, Brooke Davis.

38:25.280 --> 38:28.290
I guess we're not going to L.A.

38:29.130 --> 38:30.350
So...

38:30.350 --> 38:32.790
About that kiss...

38:34.960 --> 38:38.220
Well, this is awkward.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.190
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:45.830 --> 39:46.830
Now, that was a good day.

39:46.830 --> 39:49.040
Yes, it was.

39:49.500 --> 39:52.210
- You tell Nathan?
- No.

39:52.210 --> 39:55.990
- Brooke?
- No.

39:56.190 --> 39:59.440
Yeah, well, there's always tomorrow.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.540
Yeah.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.160
Hey, I'll be in in just a second, okay?

40:05.160 --> 40:06.640
Okay.

40:07.380 --> 40:11.560
# Too many years of dying #

40:11.560 --> 40:16.270
# Why is that? #

40:19.910 --> 40:24.350
# And so help me decide #

40:24.350 --> 40:27.170
# Help me to make up, #

40:27.170 --> 40:29.760
# Make up my mind #

40:29.760 --> 40:42.100
# Wouldn't that save you? #

40:42.100 --> 40:46.630
# And so help me decide #

40:46.630 --> 40:49.480
# Help me to make up, #

40:49.480 --> 40:52.080
# Make up my mind #

40:52.080 --> 41:18.510
# Wouldn't that save you? #

41:18.510 --> 41:25.960
# Save you wouldn't that save you? #

40:31.770 --> 40:33.370
You don't know me.

40:33.370 --> 40:35.120
It's you, Peyton.

40:36.740 --> 40:41.550
And now we can have it.

41:06.350 --> 41:11.230
You didn't even let me ask.
