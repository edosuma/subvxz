Harold Cooper
to see the president.

00:19.350 --> 00:21.079
Do you have any idea
how this happened?

00:21.120 --> 00:22.439
Sir, we don't have
much time.

00:22.490 --> 00:25.687
How Germany's
chief intelligence officer
could die in FBI custody?

00:25.720 --> 00:27.415
I don't know,
but Reddington does.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.280
_ And he'll tell us _
If you stay hlS execution.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.322
DIAZ: We need to work together
to keep this tragedy
from becoming a...

00:32.360 --> 00:33.497
A diplomatic crisis.

00:33.530 --> 00:35.794
And we need our allies to know
that everything will be done

00:35.830 --> 00:38.993
to find out what happened
and to apprehend those
responsible.

00:39.030 --> 00:40.065
Reddington knows
who that is.

00:40.100 --> 00:41.761
Director Cooper,
I don't think you understand

00:41.800 --> 00:42.960
the sensitivity
of this matter.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.308
You want everything to be done
to find out what happened.

00:45.340 --> 00:47.501
The only way to do that is
to call off the execution.

00:48.310 --> 00:49.345
You're sure that Reddington

00:49.380 --> 00:50.847
knew how to stop
the assassination.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.008
I'm not. A man about to be
executed wrll say anything.

00:54.050 --> 00:55.347
COOPER: That is not
what happened here.

00:55.380 --> 00:57.382
He knew the truth,
and you chose to ignore it.

00:57.420 --> 00:58.842
I suggest
you watch your tone.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.653
Ava Ziegler may have died
in FBI custody,

01:00.690 --> 01:01.714
but she died

01:01.760 --> 01:03.284
because you refused
to spare Reddington's life.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.059
How dare you
speak to me like that!

01:05.090 --> 01:06.648
Like I'm responsible
for this?

01:06.700 --> 01:09.089
I am the President
of the United States!

01:09.130 --> 01:10.324
It's too late for Ziegler,

01:10.370 --> 01:12.338
but if you call off
the execution,

01:12.370 --> 01:13.735
we will find
her assassrn.

01:13.770 --> 01:15.738
I've given you
my answer on that.

01:15.770 --> 01:17.499
Then let me
give you mIne.

01:17.540 --> 01:18.632
If you let Reddington die,

01:18.670 --> 01:20.570
I will be obligated to inform
my German counterparts

01:20.610 --> 01:23.738
that_ their
compatriot's blood
is on our hands,

01:23.780 --> 01:26.510
a fact I'm certain
they will consider
an act of aggression.

01:26.550 --> 01:28.472
Is that a threat?

01:28.520 --> 01:30.044
It gives me
no pleasure to make it,

01:30.090 --> 01:31.648
but, yes, sir, it is.

01:31.690 --> 01:33.954
And if you don't
make that call in
the next 60 seconds,

01:33.990 --> 01:35.878
I'll make good on it.

How are you holding up?
He did it. He called.

Who... Sorry.
What are you
talking about?

03:08.880 --> 03:11.087
The President.
He stopped it.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.917
What do you mean?
The execution.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.848
He called it off.
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait.

03:14.890 --> 03:15.959
Mr. Reddington's alive?

That's incredible.

03:21.330 --> 03:23.366
Did the warden say why
the President did it?

03:23.400 --> 03:26.062
I don't know
if he got clemency
or a stay or what.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.736
But all I know
is he's alive.

03:29.470 --> 03:30.698
Will you tell Cooper?

03:30.740 --> 03:32.162
I'm pretty sure
he already knows.

He was at the White House
all night,

the President's mind.

the right call.

You have not been
granted Clemency.

48 hours to find the person
who killed Ava Ziegler.

04:23.790 --> 04:26.725
If you succeed, your immunity
agreement will be restored.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.149
If not, your execution
will proceed.

Has that understanding
been memorialized in writing?

the paperwork now.

If Harold is satisfied with
the language, we can proceed.

MCMAHON: The particulars
are as follows.

the stay was granted to study

for you.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.255

you try your best not to kill,

04:58.290 --> 05:00.622

for the next two days.

left alone in a room
with you, I'll be fine.

Is 48 hours enough time
to find the assassin?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.732
MCMAHON: I'd think it was
more than enough time,

05:08.770 --> 05:10.237
considering all
your assurances

05:10.270 --> 05:12.204
that you knew how
to apprehend him.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.232
Thank you, Harold.
48 hours is ample.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.441
During that time, you will
wear an ankle monitor.

05:17.480 --> 05:20.972
Both Director Cooper and I
will know your location
at all times.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.580
If you try and escape,
we will find you.

05:23.620 --> 05:26.316
If you disable the device,
the director
will be prosecuted

05:26.360 --> 05:28.316

MCMAHON: Cooper doesn't
know it, but he might
have done us a favor.

like you actually want
the assassin found.

Right.

within the hour.

Uh, Bastien Moreau?

10:55.680 --> 10:58.319
Isn't he the sociopath
who tried to bomb the U.N.?

10:58.350 --> 11:00.113
The very same.
Tried to bomb the U.N.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.152

Indeed. One of Moreau's few
known associates was there.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.854
Mad as a hater,
but I had reason to hope

11:32.890 --> 11:34.858
that if Moreau were
planning something big,

11:34.890 --> 11:37.620

a lead to follow.

to Moreau in London.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.972
Armed with the address,
Dembe broke into his flat

12:02.020 --> 12:05.444

had wired $5 million

ARAM: As payment for intel
and his credentials

12:14.730 --> 12:17.392
so that Moreau could get into
Ava Ziegler's hotel room.

12:17.430 --> 12:19.421

the bug toxin to poison her

12:19.470 --> 12:23.065
before she had a chance
to meet with Senator Wade
and present a dOSSier

12:23.110 --> 12:25.101

attack on America.

without an immunity agreement,

12:31.080 --> 12:33.571
I would have to leverage
my way to freedom.

12:33.620 --> 12:37.681
Luckily, that's exactly what
this conspiracy provided.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.347
A conspiracy to
attack America how?

12:39.390 --> 12:42.188
I don't know. And Moreau
has the irksome habit

12:42.220 --> 12:43.881
of killing
anyone who does.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.921
Or trying to.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.895
We stopped the bomb
at the U.N. from going off.

to kill someone

35:41.170 --> 35:43.638
I want to highlight
three conditions.

35:43.670 --> 35:46.468
One, if you acknowledge
the agreement, it is revoked.

35:46.510 --> 35:49.035
Two, if Reddington commits
a crime, it is revoked.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.708
And three, if any members
of the Task Force

35:51.750 --> 35:53.638
are aware that Reddington
is committing a crime,

35:53.680 --> 35:56.774
they will be prosecuted
as co-conspirators.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.618
And the young man Reddington
met in prison, Vontae Jones?

35:59.650 --> 36:01.459
Yes. Mr. Jones
will be paroled

36:01.490 --> 36:03.219
aS_a condition
of this agreement.

36:03.260 --> 36:04.625
But let me be
very clear.

36:05.490 --> 36:07.685
We do not work for
Raymond Reddington.

36:07.730 --> 36:11.268
He works for us.
And by "us," I mean me.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.291
Because once you Sign,
my job will be

36:13.330 --> 36:15.537
to oversee the Task Force
for Main Justice.

36:17.470 --> 36:19.267
I'm looking forward
to that.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.062
_Your sarcasm
is duly noted.

36:21.110 --> 36:23.101
And yet, I'm being
completely genuine.

36:24.510 --> 36:26.068
You want me
to take the job.

36:26.110 --> 36:28.078
I do, because
it's proven to be one

36:28.110 --> 36:30.943
with an extraordinarily high
mortality rate.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.447
Shall we Sign?

36:32.490 --> 36:34.788
**

36:42.030 --> 36:44.498
It's official.
He's back.

36:44.530 --> 36:45.963
Not quite.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.865
First, he has to
break out of prison.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.962
ANCHOR: We begin tonight
with a developing story.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.128
Notorious fugitive
Raymond Reddington
is once again on the loose

36:54.170 --> 36:57.037
after a daring escape
from federal custody.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.173
Moments ago,
a Justice Department official

36:59.210 --> 37:00.677
issued the following
statement.

37:00.710 --> 37:03.178
After collapsing in his cell
earlier today,

37:03.220 --> 37:05.381
prison officials were
transporting
Raymond Reddington

37:05.420 --> 37:07.888
to a nearby hospital
for observation.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.956
While en route,
Reddington overtook

37:09.990 --> 37:12.151
two EMTS and a prison escort.

37:12.190 --> 37:15.193
Reddington, who was just
moments away from execution

37:15.230 --> 37:17.892
when concerns over the drugs
used in lethal injection

37:17.930 --> 37:20.023
resulted in _
a stay of execution,

37:20.070 --> 37:23.392
has once again been placed on
the FBI'S Most Wanted List.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.658
Well, that was
a long three months.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.962
Thank God it's over.
LIZ: Almost over.

37:28.010 --> 37:30.069
You still haven't explained
why Anna McMahon

37:30.110 --> 37:33.807
wanted to kill you
or why the Corsican
tried to kill her.

37:33.850 --> 37:37.809
I don't know what the plot
against this country is,

37:37.850 --> 37:40.182
but I do know She's
orchestrating it.

37:40.220 --> 37:41.812
COOPER: The Assistant
Attorney General,

37:41.860 --> 37:43.885
a top Justice Department
official,

37:43.920 --> 37:45.581
plotting against America.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.518
She sent Moreau after me

37:47.560 --> 37:50.358
because She thinks
I know more than I do.

37:50.400 --> 37:53.028
As she could track me
through my ankle monitor,

37:53.070 --> 37:54.731
I was unusually
vulnerable.

37:54.770 --> 37:56.738
Fortunately, Moreau
turned out to be

37:56.770 --> 38:00.103
a man of deep
political conviction,

38:00.140 --> 38:04.372
a nationalist who
killed for that cause
and that cause only.

38:04.410 --> 38:07.174
McMahon hired him
under false pretenses.

38:07.210 --> 38:10.668
When I set him straight,
he went to settle the score.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.280
And got his brains blown out
for his troubles.

38:13.320 --> 38:16.050
ARAM: We, uh... We have
no leads on his killer.

38:16.090 --> 38:17.853
REDDINGTON:
And you won't get any.

38:17.890 --> 38:21.553
His killer has
friends in high places.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.095
Thank you.
For what?

38:27.170 --> 38:29.536
You said we had
no exposure.
I'm not sure we do.

38:29.570 --> 38:31.401
Which means you're
not sure we don't.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.260
Until I do, I'm overseeing
the Task Force.

38:33.310 --> 38:35.232
Everything they know,
I'll know.

38:35.280 --> 38:39.273
As long as Anna McMahon
is sniffing up our skirts,

38:39.310 --> 38:42.575
an abundance of caution
Will not be enough.

38:42.620 --> 38:46.579
If we're gonna uncover the
true nature of the conspiracy,

38:46.620 --> 38:49.953
we'll have to engage
in active disinformation.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.083
Lie to Main Justice
about what we're doing.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.280
Wouldn't it be easiest
just to arrest her?

38:54.330 --> 38:57.458
Based on _what?
My word against hers?

38:57.500 --> 38:58.922
The dossier was proof.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.426
LIZ: Moreau confronted
McMahon with it.

39:00.470 --> 39:02.290
Now he's dead,
and it's gone.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.160
SAMAR: Or in her possession.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.667
Moreau read the dossier.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.234
As far as I know,
he didn't tell anyone

39:07.270 --> 39:08.806
what was in it
before he died.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.808
But he had the only copy,
and now it's missing.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.302
You better _find out
where it is.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.669
**

39:17.720 --> 39:18.982
It'll all be over soon.

39:20.790 --> 39:22.587
COOPER: We have our work
cut out for us.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.827
We know there are people
plotting against our country,

39:24.860 --> 39:28.455
and at least three people
have been murdered
to keep that plot secret.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.798
As is all too often the case,
we're looking
straight down the barrel

39:30.830 --> 39:32.627
of what's wrong
with the world.

39:32.670 --> 39:36.162
But tonight,
we're also witness
to something pretty great,

39:37.570 --> 39:40.539
that the man we hate to love

39:40.570 --> 39:42.003
lives to fight another day.

39:42.910 --> 39:44.969
Yes.
Well, thank you, Harold.

39:45.980 --> 39:47.504
Call me when
you have a lead.

39:48.350 --> 39:50.978
I'm wheels up in 45.

39:51.020 --> 39:54.410
Where are you going?
I have no earthly idea.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.711
Aanhere but here.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.978
I'd forgotten
how much this place

39:58.020 --> 40:01.729
reeks of stress
and anXIety,

40:01.760 --> 40:04.991
deodorized body odor
and Old coffee.

40:05.030 --> 40:08.022
* The old man's back again *

40:08.070 --> 40:09.935
**

40:09.970 --> 40:11.506
Was he talking
about me?

40:15.440 --> 40:16.873
I'm going to
talk to Cooper.

40:16.910 --> 40:18.901
Right. Of course. Do you
want me to come with you?

40:19.450 --> 40:20.508
No. I'll do it.

40:22.950 --> 40:25.339
Hey, it's, um...
It's the right thing to do.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.347
I know.

40:28.390 --> 40:30.756
**

40:32.290 --> 40:34.178
Hey. You never
answered my question.

40:34.230 --> 40:36.994
The reason you didn't ask him
who he really is, uh,

40:37.030 --> 40:38.725
was it because you
didn't get the chance to

40:38.770 --> 40:41.125
or because
you decided not to?

40:41.640 --> 40:42.732
I decided not to.

40:43.770 --> 40:46.967
You're just gonna let it go?
You're okay with that?

40:49.440 --> 40:52.603
I am.
And I hope you are, too.

40:53.250 --> 40:56.447
**

41:06.390 --> 41:08.858
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

41:08.900 --> 41:09.992
Do you have a minute?

41:10.560 --> 41:12.391
Of course. What's up?

41:16.270 --> 41:17.794
I'm leaving
the Task Force.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.260
**

41:21.310 --> 41:22.470
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.645
So am I.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.905
(INHALES SHARPLY)
May I ask why?

41:28.310 --> 41:29.743
No.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.240
Is there anything I can do
to Change your mind?

41:36.290 --> 41:37.757
I've loved working here.

41:39.530 --> 41:42.328
The cases,
everyone's dedication.

41:42.360 --> 41:44.453
And I met Aram.

41:45.430 --> 41:46.499
Then why leave?

41:48.940 --> 41:51.659
Because it's time.

41:54.510 --> 41:56.273
Thank you
for everything.

41:57.780 --> 42:00.442
**

42:14.560 --> 42:16.892
