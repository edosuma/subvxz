WEBVTT

00:03.628 --> 00:06.047
(dog barking in distance)

00:15.849 --> 00:18.601
(sighs)

00:18.685 --> 00:21.604
This sucks.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.149
This is just garbage.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.776
(sighs)
It's a bad story to begin with,

00:26.860 --> 00:29.237
and I'm a bad writer.
I don't know what made me think

00:29.320 --> 00:33.116
for five seconds I'd be able
to turn this into anything

00:33.199 --> 00:35.827
other than garbage.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.582
I'm a fraud. I know.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.168
Every writer thinks
they're a fraud. It's cliché.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.461
Some of us got to be right.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.130
Most of us, actually,
have to be right,

00:47.213 --> 00:49.507
statistically speaking.
(sighs)

00:49.591 --> 00:53.178
I mean, why do we act
like impostor syndrome

00:53.261 --> 00:54.804
means that you aren't
an impostor?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.639
Just because you have
Stockholm syndrome

00:56.723 --> 00:59.350
doesn't mean
you're not in Sweden.

01:01.144 --> 01:04.105
(sighs)
I quit.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.154
Stupid.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.864
Stupid. Oh, yeah, great.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.450
Mushroom cloud.
Not using that idea.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.952
Why would you? The whole story
is about the world blowing up,

01:18.036 --> 01:21.122
so, obviously, don't show the
part where the world blows up.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.042
The most interesting part
of the entire idea,

01:24.125 --> 01:27.253
and John Genius...

01:27.337 --> 01:30.548
(scoffs softly)
decides to leave it out.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.008
(sighs)

01:32.091 --> 01:35.345
Super cool creative choice,
Chayefsky.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.430
You nailed it.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.183
If I was smart,

01:40.266 --> 01:43.353
I would've started
the whole story with...

01:43.436 --> 01:45.855
♪ ♪

01:52.445 --> 01:54.197
That's pretty good.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.367
Yeah.

02:01.287 --> 02:04.999
"There has been a nuclear war.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.544
"The city is in ruins.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.003
"The air is poisoned.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.215
{\an5}Billions are dead."

02:10.088 --> 02:12.215
(door opens)

02:12.298 --> 02:14.384
{\an5}(door closes)

02:12.298 --> 02:14.384
{\an3}Hey. Hey!

02:14.467 --> 02:16.553
I did it! I figured it out!

02:16.636 --> 02:18.513
Figured what out?

02:18.596 --> 02:20.431
The story!

02:20.515 --> 02:21.724
Oh.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.934
"Oh"?!

02:23.017 --> 02:25.270
{\an1}This is huge. We got to--
we got to celebrate.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.104
{\an1}Come on.
Let's go out.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.857
I've been cooped up in here
forev...

02:29.983 --> 02:34.028
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.031
(flames crackling)

02:43.496 --> 02:46.082
We need to head to the shelter.

02:46.165 --> 02:49.002
{\an1}The reapers
will be out soon.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.464
It was just a story.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.092
It was just a story.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.305
Witness Adam Wegman,

03:00.388 --> 03:02.807
{\an1}a writer who,
up until tonight,

03:02.891 --> 03:04.767
{\an1}has never paid much mind
to the idea

03:04.851 --> 03:07.437
{\an1}of an artist's
social responsibility.

03:07.520 --> 03:11.441
He's about to learn that there's
more to art than entertainment.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.443
He's about to--
You know what?

03:13.526 --> 03:16.112
{\an1}(clicks tongue)
I think we can beat this.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.780
{\an5}Um, is Sophie here?

03:16.195 --> 03:17.780
Cut.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.616
{\an5}And that's a cut.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.616
Sophie. Sorry, Owen.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.451
{\an5}No, no, no. Of course.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.451
Uh, sorry, guys.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.703
{\an1}Hey, I'm cool.
Your show, dude.

03:23.786 --> 03:27.123
{\an5}But Betty is getting
pretty pissed at you.

03:23.786 --> 03:27.123
What?

03:27.206 --> 03:28.958
{\an5}What? No.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.958
{\an1}(chuckles)
He's playing.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.627
{\an5}You're playing.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.627
No. I'm not actually joking.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.711
{\an5}She's super pissed.
(chuckles)

03:30.710 --> 03:31.711
{\an1}Why?

03:31.794 --> 03:32.629
You're upset with me?

03:32.712 --> 03:33.963
You know,
I've been meaning to tell you.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.214
You know, you've changed.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.299
{\an5}Oh, snap.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.299
{\an3}SETH (chuckles):
Oh.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.300
You've changed, Betty.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.426
Am I part of the change?

03:38.509 --> 03:39.427
{\an1}JORDAN:
What happened to you?

03:39.510 --> 03:40.803
{\an1}BETTY:
I mean, I...

03:40.887 --> 03:42.388
{\an4}JORDAN:
Look, I had, I had
to, like, deliver

03:42.472 --> 03:43.348
{\an5}a bunch of...

03:42.472 --> 03:43.348
Hey.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.349
What's up?

03:44.432 --> 03:45.683
Hey, Sophie. Um...

03:45.767 --> 03:47.435
{\an5}Uh, walk with me?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.435
Okay.

03:47.518 --> 03:50.146
{\an3}So, I think we're not there
yet with the narration.

03:50.229 --> 03:51.606
{\an5}Yeah, I...

03:50.229 --> 03:51.606
Uh, you know?

03:51.689 --> 03:53.149
{\an1}...was actually thinking
the same.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.109
{\an5}Cool.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.109
Obviously, we want this
to be the best version

03:55.193 --> 03:56.611
{\an1}of the best thing
it can possibly be.

03:56.694 --> 03:57.987
Yes.

03:56.694 --> 03:57.987
Um...

03:58.071 --> 03:59.989
{\an1}is it a little too
on the nose, you think?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.783
{\an3}Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Thank you very much.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.785
{\an5}That's cool.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.785
Um, well, we could...

04:03.868 --> 04:05.620
could also just,
like, approach it

04:05.703 --> 04:07.038
{\an6}a little bit more
metaphorically, I guess.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.038
Mmm.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.706
I don't know.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.500
Man, I think, like...

04:10.583 --> 04:12.502
{\an1}I think we're just--
might be saying something

04:12.585 --> 04:14.295
{\an1}we don't actually want
to be saying,

04:14.379 --> 04:17.130
with the episode.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.509
Oh. Okay.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.720
Um, what do you mean?
Like what part exactly?

04:22.804 --> 04:25.348
{\an3}The art versus
entertainment stuff.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.850
Like, sort of, like,
just hit that softer?

04:27.934 --> 04:31.688
{\an1}I'm just saying, like, why do
we need to make it an either-or?

04:31.771 --> 04:34.190
Oh. Okay. Um...

04:34.274 --> 04:36.359
Sorry. Um...

04:36.442 --> 04:39.362
{\an1}But isn't that what
the episode is about?

04:39.445 --> 04:40.780
Is it?

04:40.863 --> 04:43.032
{\an1}Um...

04:43.116 --> 04:44.492
I mean, you wrote it.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.493
Oh, no, no.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.704
I mean, obviously,
I want you to be on board.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.832
{\an6}Mm-hmm.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.832
Um, I guess
I just thought the whole point

04:50.915 --> 04:54.711
{\an1}was sort of, like,
the slippery slope, right,

04:54.794 --> 04:56.337
from the path
from superhero movies or, like,

04:56.421 --> 04:59.674
stupid sci-fi crap to...
idiocracy.

04:59.757 --> 05:00.883
{\an4}(chuckles)

04:59.757 --> 05:00.883
Huh.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.220
I mean,
our show is sci-fi, right?

05:04.303 --> 05:07.223
Yeah, but it's
<i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

05:07.306 --> 05:08.683
Mm-hmm.

05:08.766 --> 05:11.728
I mean,<i> The Twilight Zone</i> isn't
just monsters on a plane wing.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.563
{\an5}Right?

05:11.811 --> 05:13.563
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.024
If there's nothing being said
of importance,

05:16.107 --> 05:17.400
then it's just campfire stories.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.068
So you don't like
campfire stories?

05:19.152 --> 05:22.613
{\an1}No, I did when
I was a little girl.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.740
Look, what Rod Serling did

05:23.823 --> 05:25.616
{\an1}was, he took
this silly genre kid stuff

05:25.700 --> 05:26.868
and he elevated it.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.244
He made art with it

05:28.327 --> 05:29.579
for grown-ups.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.913
And the reason
he's in every episode...

05:30.997 --> 05:32.540
Well, until now, right?

05:32.623 --> 05:34.542
Until now, sure.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.877
Um, but the reason...

05:35.960 --> 05:36.878
Seth needs his chair.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.755
{\an5}Oh, okay. Sorry.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.755
{\an1}Yeah.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.424
{\an1}Um...

05:41.507 --> 05:43.259
I just-- I just remember,
when I was a little girl,

05:43.342 --> 05:45.595
{\an1}I would watch the show
and I would think, "What is

05:45.678 --> 05:47.263
{\an5}The Twilight Zone?"

05:45.678 --> 05:47.263
{\an3}Mm.

05:47.346 --> 05:50.725
You know? Like, when do we get
to The Twilight Zone?

05:50.808 --> 05:52.310
{\an5}Oh...

05:50.808 --> 05:52.310
{\an1}You know?

05:52.393 --> 05:53.978
That's deep.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.105
{\an1}Well, okay,
but I was a kid

05:56.189 --> 05:58.149
{\an1}and I didn't get
what was good about the show.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.610
Which is why Rod Serling had
to come into every episode,

06:00.693 --> 06:03.279
{\an1}to remind us that The Twilight
Zone isn't this, like,

06:03.362 --> 06:05.615
sci-fi alternate dimension,
right? What's good

06:05.698 --> 06:08.409
{\an4}about the show
isn't the genre bullshit.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.409
Mm-hmm.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.786
It's the message.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.330
I just think
the-the meaning is there,

06:12.413 --> 06:14.957
{\an3}with, like, the
episode, you know?

06:15.041 --> 06:16.959
If you could just, like,
do a pass on the narration.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.127
Just make it simple.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.587
Take out some of the--
all of, like,

06:19.670 --> 06:21.839
the art v. entertainment stuff.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.091
{\an5}Okay.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.091
Like this...

06:23.174 --> 06:25.802
(clears throat)
Witness Adam Weg...

06:25.885 --> 06:27.929
{\an5}W-Wen-We...

06:25.885 --> 06:27.929
It's "Wegman,"

06:28.012 --> 06:29.138
{\an4}and...

06:28.012 --> 06:29.138
Whatever.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.641
A writer who's

06:31.724 --> 06:34.143
{\an3}i-in the middle
of a...

06:34.227 --> 06:36.479
existential crisis.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.190
{\an3}So just, you know,
give me your version

06:39.273 --> 06:41.150
and I'll make it sound cool.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.490
SOPHIE:

06:47.573 --> 06:49.951

(ringing)

07:23.776 --> 07:25.361
(quietly):
Shit.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.821
(sniffles)

07:26.904 --> 07:28.531
{\an5}(beep)

07:26.904 --> 07:28.531
Hey, Anna,

07:28.614 --> 07:30.199
{\an1}I can't really talk right now.
It's not a good time.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.951
{\an5}So you just straight up
don't respond to texts anymore?

07:32.034 --> 07:33.744
I'm really busy.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.997
{\an5}Right. Busy saving the world.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.997
MAN: Sophie. Is Sophie here?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.039
{\an5}Wouldn't want
to use the wrong adjective--

07:37.123 --> 07:38.166
{\an5}we might lose Europe.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.166
{\an1}Shit.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.543
{\an1}Anna, I cannot have this
conversation right now, okay?

07:40.626 --> 07:42.253
{\an5}I really need to go.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.253
Why do I even bother
calling you?

07:42.336 --> 07:44.505
{\an4}Goodbye.
I love you. Bye.

07:42.336 --> 07:44.505
Sophie...

07:44.589 --> 07:46.382
Hey. Sorry.

07:46.465 --> 07:48.176
They're asking me when we
can get the new narration.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.511
Because Jordan's waiting.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.513
And he's, like, waiting.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.849
Okay. Um...
(sighs)

07:54.932 --> 07:56.893
Just, like, two minutes.
I need two minutes.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.561
{\an5}Who should I send it to?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.561
We're actually
gonna have to

07:58.644 --> 08:00.855
write it up on cue cards, 'cause
we're running short on time.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.273
Okay. I can do that.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.195
(typing)

08:10.489 --> 08:13.159
The reapers will be out soon.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.579
It was just a story.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.041
It was just a story.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.920
{\an1}Picture, if you will,
a storyteller

08:24.003 --> 08:27.131
finally getting to tell
the story of a lifetime,

08:27.215 --> 08:30.927
except the story is one
of inexplicable terror

08:31.010 --> 08:33.471
and the lifetime is her own.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.472
(chuckles)

08:35.556 --> 08:38.726
Her name is Sophie Gelson.

08:38.808 --> 08:40.102
{\an3}She has
little patience

08:40.186 --> 08:42.730
{\an3}for childish diversions
or daydreams.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.274
{\an5}(whispering): Wasn't me.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.274
{\an3}But she won't be able to tune
out or turn away from what

08:45.358 --> 08:48.277
lurks, blurry, in the background

08:48.361 --> 08:50.112
of her own show.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.114
She is about to learn

08:52.198 --> 08:54.617
that when blurry comes to focus

08:54.700 --> 08:57.286
there can be no escape
from the fate laid out

08:57.370 --> 08:59.288
{\an3}for her...

08:59.372 --> 09:01.290
in The Twilight Zone.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.668
{\an5}(chuckles)

09:01.374 --> 09:03.668
Okay.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.670
(chuckles)

09:05.753 --> 09:07.672
{\an5}(bell rings)

09:05.753 --> 09:07.672
No, I di-- uh, no.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.257
{\an3}It honestly sounds
like a better episode.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.758
(laughs)

09:10.841 --> 09:13.970
{\an3}(singsongy):
Seriously, what's going on?

09:14.804 --> 09:15.972
<i>(The Twilight Zone</i> theme

NARRATOR: <i> You're traveling</i>

09:18.182 --> 09:21.644

09:21.727 --> 09:24.939
<i>It is the middle ground</i>

{\an8}(sighs)
Sorry.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.800
{\an8}JORDAN: I'm... I'm fine. I'm
just gonna memorize it, so...

09:52.883 --> 09:56.012
{\an7}if it's... whatever the thing
says is what I'm gonna say.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.847
{\an8}Well, yeah,

09:57.930 --> 09:59.849
{\an8}well, see, that's the...
that's where it...

09:59.932 --> 10:01.309
{\an8}that's where it...

10:08.274 --> 10:10.568
{\an8}Are you okay?

10:10.651 --> 10:11.652
{\an8}Jordan.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.571
{\an8}I did not...

10:13.654 --> 10:15.698
{\an9}none of that is
what I wrote.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.242
{\an8}Pretty sure it sounded
like your voice.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.077
{\an8}I'm kidding.
Of course. No, I know.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.370
{\an8}I don't know what happened.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.663
{\an8}The cue cards got messed up.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.248
{\an8}I think somebody
must have switched them.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.374
{\an8}Somebody switched them.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.876
{\an8}It's so weird, though. Right?

10:26.959 --> 10:28.711
{\an8}Like, why would anybody do that?

10:28.794 --> 10:31.672
{\an8}Who would do that?

10:28.794 --> 10:31.672
{\an8}It could be, like,
a prank for...

10:31.756 --> 10:33.841
{\an8}blooper reel...

10:31.756 --> 10:33.841
{\an8}Uh-huh. Yeah, well,

10:33.924 --> 10:35.885
{\an8}Sometimes that happens.

10:33.924 --> 10:35.885
{\an8}that wasn't funny.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.928
{\an8}Wait, a prank
for a blooper reel

10:38.012 --> 10:39.055
{\an8}that's not funny?

10:39.138 --> 10:40.681
{\an8}(laughs)

10:39.138 --> 10:40.681
{\an8}No kidding.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.185
{\an8}Can I have some of this?
Also, take that. Thank you.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.729
{\an9}Well, I'm gonna figure
out what happened.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.773
{\an7}Mm. Don't.
Don't sweat it.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.650
{\an7}Honestly. Like, if you're
worried about anything,

10:51.734 --> 10:54.403
{\an7}you should be worried
about the fact that you are

10:54.487 --> 10:56.906
{\an7}apparently in an episode
of <i> The Twilight Zone</i>

10:56.989 --> 10:58.616
{\an8}right now.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.616
{\an8}(laughs)

10:58.699 --> 11:00.785
{\an9}It's not a bad
episode idea, though.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.245
{\an9}A writer who can't
face her fears.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.373
{\an8}You think so?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.373
{\an8}I love it. Yeah.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.416
{\an7}Are you gonna follow me
to the bathroom?

11:05.456 --> 11:07.416
{\an5}Oh, no.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.210
{\an8}No, no.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.210
{\an9}(chuckles)
Uh, do send me

11:09.293 --> 11:10.795
{\an8}that narration, though.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.213
{\an8}Your version, not the one...

11:12.296 --> 11:14.799
{\an8}by the demon or whatever.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.799
{\an8}Okay, got it, J.P.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.467
{\an8}Thanks.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.467
{\an9}Mm-hmm.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.099
{\an8}AMY:
So, what was that?

11:23.182 --> 11:25.101
{\an8}What was what?

11:25.184 --> 11:27.269
{\an7}That stunt
with the cue cards.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.064
{\an9}Your guess is literally
as good as mine.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.066
{\an8}It wasn't me.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.901
{\an9}It wasn't.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.278
{\an7}Well, our director is asking
for an explanation.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.948
{\an8}Okay.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.948
{\an8}Because apparently now
we're taking a break,

11:39.031 --> 11:40.950
{\an7}and we don't have time
to take a break.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.244
{\an7}A break means we're
running into lunch, which
means we're gonna lose

11:43.327 --> 11:45.663
{\an7}about an hour that
we cannot afford to lose.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.663
{\an5}Amy, I promise you,

11:45.746 --> 11:48.416
{\an8}I care about this show at
least as much as you do.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.251
{\an8}Do you want me
to talk to him?

11:50.334 --> 11:52.420
{\an9}I can do that right
now, actually.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.420
{\an5}I would not bother him

11:52.503 --> 11:54.130
{\an9}unless I had a real
good explanation

11:54.213 --> 11:55.589
{\an9}as to what happened
back there.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.134
{\an7}And that background actor
in the library scene?

11:58.217 --> 12:00.010
{\an8}What background actor?

11:58.217 --> 12:00.010
{\an7}Please,

12:00.094 --> 12:01.679
{\an7}as if you weren't
explicitly referencing that

12:01.762 --> 12:03.305
{\an7}in the little
narration you wrote.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.474
{\an8}"Lurks blurry in the
background"? Come on.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.309
{\an7}I told you,
I didn't write that.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.271
{\an8}Well, all I know is, Owen is
definitely gonna want to know

12:10.354 --> 12:11.856
{\an9}about that whole
shitshow, too.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.149
What shitshow
are we talking about?

12:13.232 --> 12:14.650
I literally have no idea...

12:14.733 --> 12:15.776
The blurry man.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.486
The blurry man in the background

12:17.570 --> 12:19.488
who somehow wound up
in every single take,

12:19.572 --> 12:21.657
in the goddamn
library scene?

12:31.417 --> 12:32.960
"...what lurks,

12:33.043 --> 12:34.879
"blurry...

12:34.962 --> 12:37.506
in the background."

12:39.467 --> 12:41.427
JULIE:
<i>So, like...</i>

12:41.510 --> 12:43.012
you're clearing your name, huh?

12:43.095 --> 12:44.680
Rooting out sabotage,

12:44.763 --> 12:46.348
saving the show?
That's pretty exciting.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.517
It's not excitement I need.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.852
{\an1}Okay.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.812
Here it is.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.190
Check this out.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.025
{\an5}WIFE:
I thought I should let you know,

12:56.108 --> 12:57.860
there were some pages missing.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.987
{\an5}LIBRARIAN:
Ma'am, are you sure
you checked this book out

13:00.070 --> 13:02.490
at <i> this</i> library?

13:02.573 --> 13:04.366
{\an3}There. See?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.535
{\an6}Oh, my God.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.535
You should've seen Owen's face

13:06.619 --> 13:08.329
when he found out there were...

13:08.412 --> 13:10.456
{\an3}no takes without
this guy.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.583
{\an5}How did I not
notice that?

13:10.539 --> 13:12.583
Right?

13:12.666 --> 13:14.210
Nobody remembers
seeing this guy.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.544
Owen kept saying,

13:15.628 --> 13:17.922
"He wasn't there!
He wasn't there!"

13:18.005 --> 13:19.381
{\an3}I mean,

13:19.465 --> 13:21.717
{\an1}background
couldn't explain it.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.010
Did you do it?

13:23.093 --> 13:24.261
What?

13:25.471 --> 13:26.722
Why would you think that?

13:26.805 --> 13:28.224
Well, I mean,

13:28.307 --> 13:30.059
you <i> were</i> on set when we shot

13:30.142 --> 13:33.062
the first episode, so...

13:33.145 --> 13:35.856
I called up the first episode.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.443
{\an1}Like, once you notice it,
you can't un-notice it.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.903
{\an3}That's the same
guy, right?

13:40.986 --> 13:42.780
What the hell?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.407
So, what's the deal?

13:45.491 --> 13:47.785

14:03.467 --> 14:05.886
{\an6}do you know
where Jordan is?

14:03.467 --> 14:05.886
Oh. Nobody can find him.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.930
{\an5}He's on set somewhere.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.930
What do you mean,

14:08.013 --> 14:09.431
"nobody can find him"?

14:09.515 --> 14:11.267
Owen was looking for him--
they said he was

14:11.350 --> 14:12.184
checking something out on set

14:12.268 --> 14:14.812
{\an1}but couldn't figure out
where he was, so...

14:14.895 --> 14:17.648
{\an4}Do you need me to,
like, call someone
or help you find him...?

14:17.731 --> 14:19.483
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.776
Um, they said

14:20.859 --> 14:22.069
he was on set?

14:22.152 --> 14:23.445
Definitely. Yeah.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.281

34:04.250 --> 34:06.919
The ironic fate.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.132
It doesn't matter...

34:15.719 --> 34:17.722
...what I do.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.192
None of it's enough.

34:48.335 --> 34:50.254
It's you?

34:50.338 --> 34:53.341
{\an3}My God.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.510
I take it I have your attention.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.345
Good.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.347
There's a lot to explain.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.599
{\an3}Wait.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.602
Where is...?

35:09.982 --> 35:12.527
What is this place?

35:12.610 --> 35:15.655
I think you know where we are.

35:15.738 --> 35:18.241
It's where you belong.

35:18.324 --> 35:20.618
You're ready now, Sophie.

35:20.701 --> 35:23.162
We've got a lot of work to do.

35:27.333 --> 35:30.878
<i>What do we when our world</i>
<i>is turned upside down?</i>

35:30.962 --> 35:35.132
<i>When everything we thought</i>
<i>to be true is ripped away,</i>

35:35.216 --> 35:39.095
<i>and we're forced</i>
<i>to face a new reality?</i>

35:39.178 --> 35:41.889
<i>Sophie Gelson has just awoken</i>
<i>to the fact</i>

35:41.973 --> 35:44.725
<i>that when we put away</i>
<i>childish things,</i>

35:44.809 --> 35:49.730
<i>we may be closing our eyes</i>
<i>instead of opening them.</i>

35:49.814 --> 35:54.026
<i>And that perhaps our only hope</i>
<i>is to face all reality,</i>

35:54.110 --> 35:55.736
<i>a multitude of truths,</i>

35:55.820 --> 35:57.738
<i>not shrinking</i>
<i>from that vital, arrogant,</i>

35:57.822 --> 36:01.284
<i>fatal, dominant "X"</i>
<i>beyond imagination,</i>

36:01.367 --> 36:03.327
<i>but to embrace it.</i>

36:03.411 --> 36:05.955
<i>To open ourselves</i>
<i>to the unknown,</i>

36:06.038 --> 36:08.749
<i>not the end of the story</i>

36:08.833 --> 36:11.335
<i>but a new beginning...</i>

36:11.419 --> 36:13.504
<i>for The Twilight Zone.</i>
