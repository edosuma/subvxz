01:04.236 --> 01:07.053
Oh, I'm sorry. This seat is saved.

01:07.452 --> 01:09.314
Terribly sorry.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.575
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:15.700 --> 01:19.581
welcome to the inaugural
demonstration of...

01:19.706 --> 01:25.704
the Langston: a typewriter
powered by electricity,

01:25.829 --> 01:30.157
and created by that fine
gentleman right there,

01:30.168 --> 01:32.416
Mr. Alexander Langston.

01:36.528 --> 01:39.749
This demonstration will take
the form of a competition.

01:39.782 --> 01:43.174
Sorry I'm late, William. I had to
deal with a strangulated hernia.

01:43.196 --> 01:45.885
- Oh!
- So, what have I missed?

01:45.945 --> 01:47.253
Not much.

01:47.308 --> 01:50.121
I did have to guard
your seat with my life.

01:50.353 --> 01:53.339
Oh! All of Toronto is here.

01:53.464 --> 01:55.378
And who's the favourite?

01:55.890 --> 01:58.458
Regrettably, Miss Louise Cherry.

01:58.513 --> 02:02.394
- 85 words per minute.
- Oh. Pity.

02:02.421 --> 02:05.115
What about Paula Schumacher,
that Canadian girl.

02:05.153 --> 02:07.781
- Does she have a chance?
- No, I don't think so.

02:08.072 --> 02:13.454
Also, there is Miss Macy Bronson
of Colorado. She's reached 79.

02:13.515 --> 02:15.040
And George?

02:15.095 --> 02:18.140
- Um...
- And Constable George Crabtree.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.528
What is your top speed, Constable?

02:20.565 --> 02:22.860
I'd rather not say, Mr. Hewitt.

02:22.908 --> 02:26.020
I don't want to intimidate
the other competitors.

02:26.323 --> 02:28.759
They don't look terribly frightened.

02:28.808 --> 02:32.392
Let's hope that you have more of
an impact on our city's criminals.

02:32.447 --> 02:35.757
And we have Miss Louise Cherry,

02:35.801 --> 02:38.197
a star columnist for
the Toronto Telegram.

02:38.219 --> 02:39.583
Tell us, Miss Cherry,

02:39.627 --> 02:41.914
what is the fasted speed
that you have achieved?

02:41.947 --> 02:45.944
- 85 words per minute.
- That is outstanding! You're sure now?

02:45.988 --> 02:47.813
I know how you newspaper types

02:47.846 --> 02:50.397
- are prone to exaggeration.
- I'm not exaggerating.

02:51.221 --> 02:52.591
Hm.

02:52.832 --> 02:55.674
Mr. Linwood, do you think
you can give Miss Cherry

02:55.685 --> 02:57.288
a run for her money?

02:57.681 --> 03:00.754
I'll do my best, for
my self and country.

03:05.497 --> 03:09.149
Our first contestant:
Miss Maisie Bronson.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.841
Ready?

03:17.683 --> 03:19.882
Go!

03:21.432 --> 03:23.099
That is fast.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.383
Her fingers are really flying.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.833
Oh!

03:29.080 --> 03:30.669
Oh, my.

03:32.488 --> 03:34.226
Come on, Maisie!

03:36.315 --> 03:37.799
And stop.

03:37.924 --> 03:40.636
Mr. Frobisher, the final score.

03:45.930 --> 03:51.847
62 words completed with four
mistakes. Final score is 54.

03:56.939 --> 04:01.206
- Next up, Constable George Crabtree.
- Ah!

04:12.374 --> 04:14.932
Ready?

04:15.269 --> 04:18.380
Go!

04:26.359 --> 04:28.455
And... stop!

04:33.705 --> 04:36.755
51 words completed. 10 mistakes.

04:36.817 --> 04:39.298
Total score is 31.

04:42.342 --> 04:44.775
- Miss Louise Cherry.
- Watch how it's done.

04:44.830 --> 04:46.726
Miss Cherry.

04:49.214 --> 04:50.733
Ready?

04:51.001 --> 04:53.971
Go!

05:02.360 --> 05:04.119
What's happening?

05:04.244 --> 05:06.350
Oh...

05:10.414 --> 05:11.823
I can't go on.

05:11.948 --> 05:14.325
- My hand's cramped up.
- Well...

05:14.450 --> 05:17.293
No need to tally that
score, Mr. Frobisher.

05:17.362 --> 05:19.297
How disappointing.

05:20.688 --> 05:24.986
- My deepest regrets, Miss Cherry.
- Mr. Linwood.

05:32.969 --> 05:34.975
Ready? Go!

05:38.318 --> 05:40.264
That is fast!

05:42.539 --> 05:43.886
30 seconds.

05:50.779 --> 05:53.264
George! Unplug the typewriter!

05:55.490 --> 05:57.304
No! You mustn't touch the body!

05:57.429 --> 05:59.503
- Oh.
- Excuse me!

06:05.346 --> 06:06.902
He's dead, William.

06:12.284 --> 06:15.852
Ivor and I trained at
the * team speed-typists.

06:16.313 --> 06:18.655
He was the undisputed champion.

06:19.358 --> 06:21.024
Anything else?

06:23.406 --> 06:25.588
He just turned 25.

06:26.226 --> 06:28.606
And he had his whole life ahead of him.

06:28.628 --> 06:30.723
What makes it worse is that...

06:31.668 --> 06:33.692
he always struggled with his health,

06:33.736 --> 06:35.808
but he'd been doing so well recently.

06:36.044 --> 06:37.947
What was his ailment, Miss Bronson?

06:38.024 --> 06:40.163
He had rheumatic fever as a child.

06:40.185 --> 06:41.955
It left him with a weak heart.

06:42.041 --> 06:44.681
Sir, may I let the rest
of the contestants go?

06:44.709 --> 06:46.087
You have all of their particulars?

06:46.121 --> 06:47.848
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

06:48.244 --> 06:50.607
An unfortunate accident indeed, sir.

06:50.992 --> 06:52.603
Was it an accident?

06:52.728 --> 06:55.888
- It seemed so strange.
- I have yet to determine that.

06:55.922 --> 06:57.588
Thank you, Miss Bronson.

06:59.743 --> 07:01.703
The prize money was considerable, sir.

07:01.711 --> 07:03.629
$100. I could've used it.

07:03.663 --> 07:05.669
Not a lot of money for
a man's life, George.

07:05.928 --> 07:08.952
Excuse me, Detective? Edgar
Leonard, Toronto Telegraph.

07:08.979 --> 07:10.425
Do you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

07:10.447 --> 07:12.083
Mr. Leonard, the detective
is busy right now.

07:12.107 --> 07:13.630
- If you came...
- No need, Mr. Leonard.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.346
I'll handle this from here on in.

07:15.471 --> 07:17.370
I was assigned to
report on this contest.

07:17.419 --> 07:19.678
And I saw a man who was electrocuted.

07:19.712 --> 07:21.729
You weren't the only
one at risk, Miss Cherry.

07:21.854 --> 07:24.131
Well, luckily you
were spared, Constable.

07:24.488 --> 07:27.023
You shouldn't write this.
You're involved in the story.

07:27.034 --> 07:28.832
Which is all the more
reason that I should.

07:29.426 --> 07:31.050
What are your initial
thoughts, Detective?

07:31.074 --> 07:33.081
I have no comment at this time.

07:33.713 --> 07:36.500
- Constable Crabtree?
- Go home, Miss Cherry.

07:38.698 --> 07:40.414
Mr. Langston?

07:42.135 --> 07:45.050
You designed this
machine. What went wrong?

07:45.061 --> 07:47.365
It should have been in
perfect working order.

07:47.398 --> 07:50.295
- Well, it clearly wasn't.
- Then it was tampered with.

07:50.691 --> 07:52.752
- By whom?
- A rival?

07:53.033 --> 07:56.314
There's great competition
among typewriter manufacturers.

07:56.699 --> 07:59.200
Remington, Underwood, Royal:

07:59.244 --> 08:01.687
they know my machine is
going to change the world.

08:01.721 --> 08:04.412
- I'll be needing to take a look at it.
- Of course.

08:04.413 --> 08:07.079
I'm as anxious as you are
to get to the bottom of this.

08:07.204 --> 08:10.795
Mr. Langston, besides yourself,
who else had access to the plans

08:10.822 --> 08:12.735
- and schematics of the machine?
- No one.

08:12.763 --> 08:16.270
- This is my invention, solely.
- So you built a faulty device.

08:16.286 --> 08:17.934
- That thing could have killed me!
- I did not!

08:17.958 --> 08:20.047
I have tested this
machine numerous times.

08:20.075 --> 08:22.944
So, you know of no one who had
the knowledge to tamper with it?

08:22.960 --> 08:26.328
- Anyone could have tampered with it.
- Anyone with a reason?

08:26.842 --> 08:28.557
There may be one person.

08:28.590 --> 08:30.211
His name is Alphonse Maloney.

08:30.222 --> 08:32.866
He worked with me during
the design of the machine.

08:32.991 --> 08:34.917
Until we had a falling out.

08:35.192 --> 08:37.006
Thank you. George, please

08:37.015 --> 08:39.159
- see that the machine is delivered to my office.
- Yes, sir.

08:39.183 --> 08:40.332
I'll need it back.

08:40.357 --> 08:42.553
It's evidence now, Mr. Langston.

08:46.581 --> 08:50.025
I've made no bones about my
disagreement with Alexander Langston.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.241
He gave me the shoe for no good reason.

08:52.272 --> 08:55.580
Did you try to get retribution by
tampering with his new typewriter?

08:55.705 --> 08:58.196
If I was going to hurt Mr.
Langston, I would hurt him,

08:58.218 --> 08:59.906
not some innocent bystander.

09:00.223 --> 09:03.281
Besides, I've given up my
resentment a long time ago.

09:04.666 --> 09:06.442
Well, if not you, then who?

09:07.133 --> 09:09.454
Competition brings out
the worst in people.

09:09.489 --> 09:10.637
Always has.

09:10.954 --> 09:13.655
Progress isn't always
for the best, you know?

09:13.923 --> 09:15.863
I wish Mr. Langston no ill will.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.529
But I do not wish him success.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.331
Why is that?

09:19.365 --> 09:22.180
The purity of writing
is achieved by effort.

09:22.659 --> 09:25.539
To electrify a typewriter
changes it forever.

09:25.878 --> 09:28.674
Can you imagine the same being
done to an instrument like this?

09:29.445 --> 09:30.901
It would be heresy.

09:36.015 --> 09:37.326
William!

09:37.361 --> 09:38.654
It's here!

09:39.591 --> 09:40.906
Take a look.

09:43.637 --> 09:44.983
- Oh...
- _

09:44.996 --> 09:46.852
- _
- It looks quite good, doesn't it?

09:46.874 --> 09:48.774
The first run is 500 copies.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.871
- "500"?!
- That's the standard.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.749
Now, we just need to sell it.

09:52.797 --> 09:55.027
I had imagined that's
your job, isn't it?

09:55.040 --> 09:56.901
We must all play our parts.

09:56.914 --> 09:59.466
To that end, I have arranged
a series of readings.

09:59.501 --> 10:01.339
- The first one is tomorrow.
- Oh!

10:01.379 --> 10:03.112
And who will be doing these readings?

10:03.134 --> 10:05.104
Why, you two. The authors.

10:06.498 --> 10:08.857
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

10:08.982 --> 10:11.369
You two are the star attraction:

10:11.391 --> 10:14.095
a married couple solving heinous crimes.

10:14.134 --> 10:15.672
If the newspapers had any sense,

10:15.686 --> 10:18.003
they would be publishing a
weekly serial of your adventures.

10:18.012 --> 10:19.012
It would be a hit!

10:19.613 --> 10:22.261
Well, if you think
it would help sales...

10:22.534 --> 10:25.463
I suppose we could come up with
something interesting to say.

10:25.518 --> 10:26.932
Let the company buy you lunch.

10:26.945 --> 10:28.948
We can go over the
details of the reading.

10:32.373 --> 10:36.065
- It does look a handsome volume.
- Indeed, it does.

10:47.666 --> 10:49.348
- George?
- Ah!

10:49.925 --> 10:51.387
Sir, I'm sorry. I...

10:51.420 --> 10:53.075
I see the new book has come out.

10:53.251 --> 10:55.555
It has. It's very exciting.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.295
I dare say.

10:58.194 --> 11:01.195
If you'd like, I can arrange for
you to receive an advance copy.

11:01.739 --> 11:04.515
I think I'm familiar enough
with the content, sir.

11:04.878 --> 11:06.271
Of course.

11:06.396 --> 11:09.808
Oh, George, find out all you can
about the contestants, please.

11:09.842 --> 11:14.002
Sir... they're just some typists
trying for a little prize money.

11:14.244 --> 11:15.876
On the surface.

11:15.948 --> 11:17.745
But as I say in the book,

11:17.767 --> 11:19.966
one must always dig deeper.

11:20.005 --> 11:22.473
I don't ever recall you
doing much digging, sir.

11:22.968 --> 11:25.651
- What's that?
- I'll look into that right away, sir.

11:25.992 --> 11:27.388
Very good.

11:30.884 --> 11:33.089
So, the Detective and
the Doctor wrote a book.

11:33.149 --> 11:34.496
So they say.

11:34.529 --> 11:36.668
How'd they do that with all
they have on their plate?

11:36.690 --> 11:37.976
Hmm.

11:38.482 --> 11:40.197
Well, I've heard it's very good.

11:40.322 --> 11:42.841
You have? From who?

11:43.182 --> 11:44.991
Well, if they wrote it, it must be.

11:45.029 --> 11:47.555
Oh, Higgins, will you stop
nattering? We have work to do.

11:47.590 --> 11:50.047
- George! Henry.
- Dr. Ogden.

11:50.078 --> 11:51.160
Shopping, I see.

11:51.204 --> 11:53.460
Well, I thought I should
get something for tomorrow.

11:53.585 --> 11:54.916
Oh, do you have a function to attend?

11:54.933 --> 11:58.096
William and I are doing a public
reading of our book tomorrow evening.

11:58.100 --> 12:00.102
- I hope you both can attend!
- Hmm!

12:00.163 --> 12:01.905
Anyway, I must rush.

12:03.526 --> 12:06.368
- I think I'll go.
- Yes. You do that, Higgins.

12:08.023 --> 12:10.083
I think the chapter dealing
with the Lipstick Murders

12:10.107 --> 12:12.747
- is particularly well-written, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

12:13.954 --> 12:17.199
George... can you assist
me with this cover?

12:22.483 --> 12:25.143
Sir, if this typewriter's
been made into a weapon,

12:25.209 --> 12:27.819
it could be excellent fodder
for the second installment.

12:27.854 --> 12:31.357
Oh, I don't think the Doctor and
I will be writing another book.

12:32.330 --> 12:33.847
Hmm?

12:34.093 --> 12:35.452
Look at this.

12:36.019 --> 12:37.580
What am I looking at?

12:37.607 --> 12:40.565
A wire is attached to the...

12:40.690 --> 12:43.034
Q key.

12:45.438 --> 12:48.037
And also to the power supply.

12:48.615 --> 12:52.160
There's another strip wire
running back toward the keys.

12:54.771 --> 12:56.035
Oh, yes.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.548
It's attached to the Shift key.

13:00.835 --> 13:02.677
So, presumably

13:03.568 --> 13:06.245
if both are depressed at the same time,

13:06.267 --> 13:08.004
that would complete the circuit,

13:08.032 --> 13:10.929
and the arc would
travel through the heart.

13:12.765 --> 13:15.313
George, do you have the text
that was used in the contest?

13:15.339 --> 13:16.628
Yes, I do.

13:18.814 --> 13:21.610
The only time the letter capital Q

13:21.637 --> 13:24.188
appears in the text is here...

13:24.927 --> 13:27.946
line 8, word 94.

13:28.899 --> 13:31.107
Now, Miss Bronson went first.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.489
She reached line 5, word 62.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.617
Then, you went next,

13:36.705 --> 13:38.701
reaching word 50.

13:38.732 --> 13:40.464
Well, I wasn't at my best, sir.

13:40.491 --> 13:42.272
I think I have a cold setting in.

13:42.307 --> 13:44.181
What's the point of all this anyway?

13:44.695 --> 13:48.284
Miss Cherry could
have reached capital Q.

13:48.535 --> 13:50.290
And that would have closed the circuit.

13:50.809 --> 13:52.537
The shock was meant for her.

13:53.777 --> 13:56.798
Sir, she's fortunate she had
that arm cramp when she did.

13:58.090 --> 13:59.754
Was she fortunate, George?

14:00.348 --> 14:01.892
Or was she faking?

14:09.326 --> 14:13.077
You may speak with my doctor, I
assure you my typing injury is real.

14:13.707 --> 14:14.767
We shall.

14:15.615 --> 14:17.775
If you're telling the
truth, Miss Cherry,

14:17.788 --> 14:19.736
then I believe you are being targeted

14:19.767 --> 14:22.221
by a murderer who has yet to succeed.

14:22.569 --> 14:24.776
Me? I doubt that.

14:25.093 --> 14:27.990
Have you made any enemies
during your career, Miss Cherry?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.499
A good many, I'd reckon.

14:29.525 --> 14:31.193
It's par for the course
when you're a journalist

14:31.194 --> 14:32.194
and you tell the truth.

14:32.292 --> 14:34.192
And outside of work?

14:34.410 --> 14:37.873
"Outside of work". Work takes
up a great deal of my time.

14:37.910 --> 14:41.253
No quarrels with friends or
arguments with neighbours?

14:42.066 --> 14:44.674
I have no neighbours I
care to interact with.

14:45.479 --> 14:48.056
- Have you received any threats?
- Of course.

14:48.118 --> 14:49.662
Why, just the other day,
I received one that said

14:49.684 --> 14:51.817
the world would be a better
place if I wasn't in it.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.577
That must be upsetting.

14:53.599 --> 14:55.521
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

14:55.781 --> 14:57.016
For everyone who hates me,

14:57.021 --> 14:59.550
there's a great deal of people
who appreciate what I do.

14:59.823 --> 15:02.502
I write for ordinary, everyday people.

15:02.836 --> 15:04.218
I give them what they want,

15:04.227 --> 15:05.709
not what they're supposed to want.

15:05.731 --> 15:07.104
I'm sure you do.

15:07.321 --> 15:09.529
Why should I ram stories

15:09.542 --> 15:11.719
of tariffs and treaties
down people's throats?

15:11.722 --> 15:13.600
Because I think it's
what's good for them?

15:14.068 --> 15:17.551
I write stories that people
can relate to, warts and all.

15:17.714 --> 15:19.460
And if I ruffle a few
feathers along the way,

15:19.478 --> 15:20.678
I consider it a job well done.

15:20.806 --> 15:22.922
And the people at the Telegraph,

15:23.450 --> 15:26.546
do they think you've done a good job?

15:26.867 --> 15:28.447
The people at the Telegraph

15:28.455 --> 15:31.143
realize I'm the reason
they're still employed.

15:38.509 --> 15:40.920
Miss Cherry is an excellent worker.

15:41.045 --> 15:42.393
She's dedicated.

15:42.614 --> 15:44.434
Some people can misunderstand this.

15:44.447 --> 15:46.215
She can come across as abrupt.

15:46.340 --> 15:49.895
Is that a euphemism
for rude, Mr. Elliot?

15:49.909 --> 15:51.128
She speaks her mind.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.910
That is but one of the many
things I admire about her.

15:55.035 --> 15:56.863
He said "abrupt", did he?

15:56.933 --> 15:58.002
She's more than that.

15:58.050 --> 16:00.165
She has no regard for
other peoples' feelings.

16:00.398 --> 16:02.791
She's opinionated and critical.

16:03.002 --> 16:04.920
The newspaper is worse for having her.

16:04.946 --> 16:06.498
Louise Cherry's a dreadful woman.

16:06.564 --> 16:09.204
She would chop up her own mother
if it would give her a good story.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.925
Does she ever get angry
letters from readers?

16:12.050 --> 16:14.959
- Boatloads.
- Does she pay them much mind?

16:15.084 --> 16:16.838
I'd say she enjoys them.

16:16.963 --> 16:19.275
She likes to be noticed,
does our Miss Cherry.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.219
Positive attention or negative,

16:21.255 --> 16:23.489
she doesn't much care as
long as it's some attention.

16:23.876 --> 16:26.116
You wouldn't still have some
of these letters, would you?

16:29.439 --> 16:31.418
_

16:31.543 --> 16:33.749
_

16:33.874 --> 16:36.049
_

16:36.174 --> 16:38.710
_

16:38.737 --> 16:40.469
_

16:40.526 --> 16:43.776
_

16:44.696 --> 16:46.239
What are you doing, William?

16:46.437 --> 16:48.342
I'm due at the hospital.

16:51.818 --> 16:53.053
Oh...

16:54.706 --> 16:57.306
My goodness. You do look handsome.

16:57.715 --> 17:01.939
It's not every day I appear
on stage with my wife.

17:02.064 --> 17:05.056
You know, we should figure
out what we're going to do.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.162
I was thinking that
perhaps you could start out

17:07.185 --> 17:10.433
reading the first chapter, then
I'll do the next, and so on?

17:10.558 --> 17:13.358
- I think we can do better than that.
- Do you?

17:13.483 --> 17:15.771
- And what's that?
- You'll see.

17:17.564 --> 17:19.395
I'll see you this evening.

17:20.675 --> 17:22.154
Oh, wait.

17:23.111 --> 17:25.233
So, you're not going to
the Detective's reading?

17:25.579 --> 17:28.507
- I don't think so.
- Aren't you interested in the book?

17:28.545 --> 17:31.453
Oh, I'm very familiar
with the book, Higgins.

17:32.124 --> 17:34.515
In fact, if you really want the truth,

17:34.586 --> 17:36.324
I wrote the entire thing.

17:37.571 --> 17:39.341
- What?
- Higgins, Detective Murdoch

17:39.363 --> 17:42.195
is brilliant at what he does,
but he can't write for toffee!

17:42.226 --> 17:43.691
They asked me for my help.

17:43.705 --> 17:47.325
I gave it willingly as an
experienced, published author.

17:47.351 --> 17:49.035
I'm telling you, if it wasn't for me,

17:49.048 --> 17:50.948
that book would've sunk like a stone.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.486
What would haves sunk, George?

17:53.517 --> 17:57.747
Uh, sir... Miss Cherry's heart
when she read all this awful mail.

17:57.773 --> 17:59.810
The majority of it isn't even signed.

17:59.885 --> 18:03.350
To not stand behind one's
convictions is pure cowardice.

18:03.376 --> 18:06.196
Anonymity does seem to bring
out the worst in people, sir.

18:06.693 --> 18:08.377
Any we should be concerned with?

18:08.768 --> 18:10.233
Uh... yes.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.151
We put aside these three.

18:12.276 --> 18:15.823
Miss Cherry wrote very unpleasant,

18:15.858 --> 18:18.669
personal things about them,
and they wrote back in kind.

18:19.549 --> 18:21.409
- Bring them in.
- Sir...

18:21.726 --> 18:24.325
- That is a handsome suit.
- Oh.

18:25.007 --> 18:27.421
Thank you, Henry. It's
for the book reading.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.475
I'd better change now.

18:32.601 --> 18:34.436
I wonder if there's a
chapter about the fact

18:34.453 --> 18:37.260
- that we seem to do most of the work.
- Hmm. Not likely.

18:37.515 --> 18:40.284
Frankly, I hope Louise
Cherry was upset by it.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.732
She deserves to be.

18:41.763 --> 18:44.446
You are a city councillor, are you not?

18:44.571 --> 18:46.557
I am. She wrote an article

18:46.601 --> 18:49.860
in which she suggested that
I've had several dalliances

18:49.869 --> 18:51.492
with vaudeville dancers.

18:52.046 --> 18:55.231
Was there any truth to
Miss Cherry's assertions?

18:55.275 --> 18:56.581
That is not the point.

18:56.818 --> 18:59.616
Yes, I did write a
letter to Louise Cherry.

19:00.007 --> 19:02.721
I would not consider
it a poison pen letter.

19:03.363 --> 19:05.927
How would you describe it, Ms. Thompson?

19:05.967 --> 19:07.463
- Strongly
- worded.

19:07.691 --> 19:09.890
You wrote that she would

19:09.948 --> 19:13.722
- "regret these lies until her dying day".
- I was angry,

19:13.733 --> 19:15.827
but I did nothing
more than threaten her.

19:16.192 --> 19:18.131
I'm letting my lawyer
handle this from now on.

19:18.144 --> 19:20.484
We're suing her and the
newspaper for all they're worth.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.564
And what's the status
of the investigation?

19:22.573 --> 19:25.089
- I really can't say anything.
- I have the right to know,

19:25.106 --> 19:28.172
both as a journalist and possible
target of any further action.

19:28.176 --> 19:30.688
And I've told you, I
really can't say anything.

19:31.033 --> 19:33.721
I should have known not to
expect more of a kept man.

19:35.453 --> 19:39.220
- Oh, Constable Crabtree?
- Currently occupied, Miss Cherry.

19:40.094 --> 19:43.975
Interesting. So, Mr. Banks
didn't exactly leave the matter

19:43.997 --> 19:46.030
- with his lawyers.
- His suit was dismissed.

19:46.058 --> 19:48.811
After that, he paid three
visits to the Telegraph office.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.271
On two of those occasions,

19:50.302 --> 19:53.016
they had to send for
constables from Station House 1.

19:53.141 --> 19:56.059
- And he is an electrical contractor.
- Indeed.

19:56.130 --> 19:58.579
More than capable of
sabotaging a typewriter.

19:59.234 --> 20:01.767
- I want him in here, George.
- Right.

20:04.059 --> 20:05.338
With me, Higgins.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.357
And we'll need a couple of lads.

20:11.464 --> 20:14.085
Miss Cherry. Lads, let's go.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.560
You're with me, right? Right, then come.

20:22.964 --> 20:25.655
The Adelaide incident was
nothing more than a setback.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.200
The man responsible has been sacked,

20:27.253 --> 20:29.034
- I have every...
- Excuse me, sir.

20:29.069 --> 20:30.772
The Detective has asked
that you accompany me

20:30.794 --> 20:32.514
down to the Station
for further questioning.

20:32.563 --> 20:35.763
What are you blathering about?
I've answered enough questions.

20:35.888 --> 20:37.951
Well, if you don't want to
come down on your own volition,

20:37.975 --> 20:40.324
- I suppose I can put you under...
- Get your hands off me!

20:40.359 --> 20:42.109
I have done nothing wrong.

20:42.234 --> 20:44.845
Actually, you just assaulted
a police officer. Lads.

20:45.289 --> 20:48.777
- What?
- Mr. Banks, why is the constable arresting you?

20:48.786 --> 20:51.446
Another fire, perhaps? Or is
it because you tried to kill me?

20:51.464 --> 20:53.061
You're nothing but a criminal.

20:53.078 --> 20:55.752
I should've killed you long before now!

20:56.223 --> 20:57.617
Get him out of here.

20:58.892 --> 21:00.634
Can I quote you on that, Mr. Banks?

21:00.665 --> 21:02.259
"You should have killed
me long before now".

21:02.283 --> 21:05.072
- Is that what you said?
- Miss Cherry! That's enough.

21:11.308 --> 21:13.709
So, you can assure me Mr.
Banks is the guilty party.

21:13.763 --> 21:15.064
We believe so.

21:15.103 --> 21:17.377
But you can't guarantee that
no one else will do me harm?

21:17.408 --> 21:20.012
I'm not sure anyone
could guarantee that.

21:20.137 --> 21:21.217
Very funny.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.308
I hope you throw the book
at him for trying to kill me.

21:23.332 --> 21:26.073
And for actually killing
young Mr. Linwood.

21:26.082 --> 21:28.461
Miss Cherry, Detective.

21:28.483 --> 21:31.139
Congratulations on the
resolution of the case.

21:31.170 --> 21:32.674
It may not be resolved at all.

21:32.709 --> 21:35.194
Ah, yes. Due process
and all that rot. Look,

21:35.216 --> 21:37.322
I've decided to remount the contest.

21:37.344 --> 21:39.486
All of the other
contestants are in agreement.

21:39.855 --> 21:42.190
I was hoping you would
agree to take part.

21:42.212 --> 21:44.631
Of course. I'd still like
to win that prize money.

21:44.697 --> 21:45.783
So would I.

21:45.823 --> 21:47.476
I didn't perform at my best last time.

21:47.485 --> 21:48.972
I'd like a chance to redeem myself.

21:49.539 --> 21:50.991
It's settled then.

21:51.158 --> 21:53.277
There ought to be a large audience.

21:53.317 --> 21:56.105
I'm sure there will be. A
frisson of danger is a great draw.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.230
I'm not sure it would be wise.

21:58.261 --> 22:00.126
The matter isn't resolved yet.

22:00.251 --> 22:02.970
Are you saying I cannot
stage this competition?

22:03.004 --> 22:05.187
I'm saying I don't
think it would be wise.

22:05.231 --> 22:07.052
And I'll take that under advisement.

22:07.206 --> 22:09.010
I've had a new Langston shipped up.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.464
You're welcome to examine
it before the contest.

22:11.543 --> 22:12.651
Good luck.

22:13.685 --> 22:14.727
Gentlemen.

22:16.244 --> 22:20.766
George... are you sure you
want to re-enter the contest?

22:20.775 --> 22:22.733
Your last result wasn't...

22:22.777 --> 22:25.811
Sir, I think I can beat her this time.

22:25.936 --> 22:28.604
And a little recognition
might be nice for once.

22:28.846 --> 22:30.886
I'm sorry, I didn't...

22:35.306 --> 22:37.814
Julia? We're going to be late.

22:37.845 --> 22:39.715
Hold your horses.

22:40.529 --> 22:42.772
Oh, you look splendid.

22:42.833 --> 22:45.516
As do you. I must say,

22:45.549 --> 22:48.869
judging by the ones I've seen,
we look too good to be writers.

22:50.029 --> 22:51.508
What's that?

22:51.766 --> 22:55.405
I thought I would enliven our
presentation with a little demonstration.

22:55.443 --> 22:57.532
Oh! Good idea. What
are we demonstrating?

22:57.560 --> 22:59.193
Now, now. Surprise.

23:00.743 --> 23:01.880
Come, come!

23:01.881 --> 23:04.218
We mustn't keep the taxicab waiting!

23:10.116 --> 23:11.403
Miss Cherry.

23:12.122 --> 23:14.139
I just came to see
that you're all right.

23:14.194 --> 23:16.168
Of course I'm all right. Ahem.

23:16.293 --> 23:19.093
I hope you're not here to convince
me to drop out of the contest.

23:19.142 --> 23:21.083
No, of course not.

23:23.156 --> 23:25.174
The publisher gave me an advance copy.

23:25.191 --> 23:28.775
- Hoping I'd review it, I suppose.
- Is that right? Have you read it?

23:29.451 --> 23:30.891
I have.

23:32.057 --> 23:33.601
It's quite good.

23:34.591 --> 23:35.987
Of course it is.

23:36.014 --> 23:37.540
Why would you say that?

23:37.613 --> 23:41.055
Oh, let's just say I know a
little something of its genesis.

23:41.632 --> 23:43.404
Do you?

23:44.266 --> 23:46.674
Well, thank you...

23:47.768 --> 23:50.088
for being concerned about me, George.

23:55.483 --> 23:57.180
Thanks.

24:01.390 --> 24:02.852
Right.

24:03.094 --> 24:05.002
- Thank you, Henry.
- Oh!

24:05.127 --> 24:06.800
Oh. Thank you, sir.

24:06.877 --> 24:09.378
Uh, sir, I was wondering
if I might attend.

24:09.455 --> 24:11.208
- Of course.
- As long as you allow us

24:11.230 --> 24:13.946
to autograph your copy.

24:18.573 --> 24:19.955
Ahem.

24:25.260 --> 24:28.053
I wrote the whole thing.
That's not a word of a lie.

24:28.449 --> 24:29.686
Why?

24:29.811 --> 24:33.815
Well, Detective Murdoch is a genius,
to be sure. And the Doctor is a...

24:33.848 --> 24:36.960
brilliant scientist, but neither
one of them can write a stitch.

24:37.213 --> 24:39.983
- So, you took over?
- Mm!

24:40.401 --> 24:42.276
Only because they asked me to.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.090
And why wouldn't they? Who wouldn't

24:44.167 --> 24:47.067
take the expert counsel
of a published author?

24:48.085 --> 24:50.827
So, they asked you and
yet, gave you no credit.

24:51.273 --> 24:52.978
Not that I can see.

24:53.038 --> 24:54.660
Why don't you check the
acknowledgements page

24:54.676 --> 24:56.916
at the back of the book? Maybe
you're mentioned in there.

25:00.697 --> 25:03.291
"George... Carbtree"?!

25:03.416 --> 25:06.007
They couldn't even spell
my last name properly?

25:06.732 --> 25:08.343
They'll make money off this.

25:08.393 --> 25:12.350
Off the sweat of my brow! And
I'll see nothing for it. Nothing!

25:12.576 --> 25:14.208
That's not true, George.

25:14.538 --> 25:16.342
You could get revenge.

25:19.981 --> 25:21.902
Well, time to go on.

25:22.625 --> 25:24.148
It's quite sparse.

25:24.225 --> 25:25.906
Shouldn't we wait a little longer?

25:25.940 --> 25:29.508
I've only booked it until
9. It's time to go. Ahem.

25:29.878 --> 25:31.608
Ahem!

25:32.037 --> 25:35.670
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to this very special evening.

25:35.698 --> 25:37.754
It is with great pleasure
that I bring to you

25:37.770 --> 25:41.157
Detective William Murdoch and
his lovely wife, Dr. Julia Ogden,

25:41.179 --> 25:43.329
who tonight are
launching their new book,

25:43.389 --> 25:45.857
Solving Murder: A Scientific Approach.

25:45.982 --> 25:47.754
Ah!

25:49.651 --> 25:51.349
The book is available for purchase,

25:51.382 --> 25:53.954
and the authors will be
happy to sign your copy.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.928
Oh, please, do come forward.
Leave room for latecomers.

25:56.983 --> 25:59.419
Ah! Sir. Come in, sir. Welcome.

26:00.151 --> 26:02.867
You've got the right place.
We were just about to begin.

26:02.992 --> 26:06.599
And now, it is my pleasure to
present Detective William Murdoch,

26:06.640 --> 26:09.389
Toronto's own Sherlock Holmes.

26:13.533 --> 26:15.567
Good evening, audience.

26:15.821 --> 26:19.847
I can assure you that I
am not Sherlock Holmes.

26:20.569 --> 26:23.613
Unlike Mr. Holmes, I am real.

26:27.041 --> 26:31.522
I would like to welcome
you to an evening of murder.

26:31.845 --> 26:35.329
Dr. Julia Ogden, also my wife,

26:35.377 --> 26:38.202
will be reading chapters from our book.

26:38.608 --> 26:44.263
But first, I thought you might
like a little demonstration.

26:44.285 --> 26:46.593
Oh, Lord, not the...

26:46.881 --> 26:48.723
- Fingermarks!
- ... fingermarks.

26:48.764 --> 26:54.331
How does one catch a killer if one
does not know who the killer is?

26:54.647 --> 26:58.576
Identifying someone is one
of the most important steps

26:58.615 --> 27:00.517
in solving any crime.

27:01.061 --> 27:06.810
Did you know that every person
on Earth has a unique signature?

27:06.821 --> 27:10.268
One not written with pen and ink,

27:10.329 --> 27:12.770
but on the very appendages

27:12.797 --> 27:15.364
that utilise such tools:

27:15.860 --> 27:17.278
fingers!

27:17.471 --> 27:19.065
That's the thing, George.

27:19.092 --> 27:21.830
Nobody ever got anywhere
in this world by being nice.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.523
Trust me, I've tried.

27:23.648 --> 27:26.580
- Have you?
- Consider your friends.

27:27.427 --> 27:29.483
Do you feel like they've
treated you fairly?

27:30.258 --> 27:31.732
Perhaps not.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.870
And if you say nothing,

27:33.914 --> 27:35.950
they'll continue to act in this manner.

27:36.965 --> 27:38.790
I suppose you're right.

27:38.834 --> 27:40.896
You need to stand up for who you are,

27:41.396 --> 27:43.512
because the world isn't fair.

27:43.637 --> 27:45.212
Far from it.

27:46.492 --> 27:50.005
Well, just because I'm only
a constable doesn't mean I'm...

27:50.043 --> 27:52.743
incapable of thinking, or...

27:52.809 --> 27:54.870
or putting a coherent sentence together,

27:54.919 --> 27:56.750
or spelling properly.

27:57.789 --> 28:00.160
Now you know what it's like
being in my shoes, George...

28:01.565 --> 28:03.446
to be judged for what you are,

28:04.106 --> 28:05.607
and not who you are.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.895
If I were a man, I'd be
called a straight shooter,

28:09.020 --> 28:12.133
but because I'm female
I'm called a... harridan,

28:12.331 --> 28:13.488
or a harpy.

28:23.463 --> 28:24.756
Not another one.

28:24.769 --> 28:26.230
Let me see.

28:29.481 --> 28:30.875
"You have brought me to this.

28:30.884 --> 28:33.751
And now, you will see the
result of your choices."

28:35.040 --> 28:37.054
Whoever wrote this is
inside the building.

28:37.115 --> 28:39.139
- Louise!
- No, I've put up with this long enough.

28:39.196 --> 28:41.140
- Are you coming?
- Louise!

28:47.930 --> 28:49.580
Press firmly.

28:50.715 --> 28:52.127
Very good.

28:53.059 --> 28:56.173
Don't worry. I'm sure
these won't go any further.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.971
You don't have a police record.

28:59.248 --> 29:00.765
You're a whorl!

29:01.047 --> 29:02.305
Excuse me?

29:02.982 --> 29:06.696
Sir Francis Galton established
three basic patterns:

29:06.735 --> 29:10.231
the whorl, the loop, and the arch.

29:10.286 --> 29:15.003
We have Sir Edward Henry to thank
for the system that we use today.

29:15.042 --> 29:17.181
He established Scotland Yard's

29:17.203 --> 29:20.017
Central Fingerprint Bureau.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.547
Did you know that recently,

29:24.569 --> 29:26.564
this very room was the site of a murder?

29:26.603 --> 29:29.928
And we'll get to that
in due time, Dr. Ogden.

29:29.987 --> 29:32.600
Now that we have established

29:32.639 --> 29:36.398
the basic identifying criteria
of the fingermark, ahem,

29:36.431 --> 29:38.844
we can move to the next step,

29:38.888 --> 29:41.752
and this is my favourite.

29:43.356 --> 29:46.985
- Perhaps whoever sent it has already left.
- Coward.

29:47.110 --> 29:48.735
Is there anywhere we haven't checked?

29:48.770 --> 29:50.982
There's one more place: the basement.

29:51.483 --> 29:54.382
Oh, wonderful. Let's see
what's lurking in the basement.

29:57.205 --> 29:59.725
Perhaps we should have
just read from the book.

30:00.104 --> 30:02.421
I thought they would
find it interesting.

30:02.826 --> 30:04.894
You did go on a bit long, William.

30:05.140 --> 30:07.199
There's no point explaining something

30:07.203 --> 30:09.319
if you don't include all of the details.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.849
Yes, of course.

30:10.919 --> 30:13.633
- You could have come to my aid.
- I tried!

30:13.659 --> 30:15.903
You didn't let me get
a word in edgewise!

30:16.083 --> 30:18.524
- Ahem.
- Mr. Clements.

30:18.955 --> 30:22.179
- How many books did we sell?
- Uh, only one.

30:22.304 --> 30:25.525
To a Mr. Henry Higgins.

30:25.547 --> 30:28.506
He wanted me to make sure
you were aware of his name.

30:28.572 --> 30:29.874
Oh.

30:30.538 --> 30:32.600
Perhaps we need to consider you two

30:32.627 --> 30:35.622
may not be the best
advertisements for your book.

30:36.220 --> 30:38.639
Or we could refine our presentation.

30:44.288 --> 30:45.531
Hello?

30:47.888 --> 30:49.427
Hello?

30:50.570 --> 30:52.325
Toronto Constabulary!

30:52.985 --> 30:55.822
Is anybody down here? Show yourself.

31:00.892 --> 31:02.203
Put that down.

31:07.191 --> 31:08.700
No, no, no, no!

31:11.303 --> 31:12.794
Mr. Elliott,

31:13.414 --> 31:15.204
please put that gun now.

31:15.807 --> 31:17.390
Did you write that note?

31:18.621 --> 31:19.884
I did.

31:20.675 --> 31:22.681
Why did you threaten her, sir?

31:23.705 --> 31:25.618
It wasn't a threat.

31:25.743 --> 31:28.362
- It was a goodbye.
- No, no! Don't!

31:28.393 --> 31:29.452
Why?

31:29.577 --> 31:31.484
I have no reason to go on living.

31:31.506 --> 31:33.784
Of course you do! You're
a... you're a young man!

31:33.801 --> 31:36.352
- You have your whole future before you!
- "Future"?

31:36.413 --> 31:38.797
And what is a future
if my love is not in it?

31:39.580 --> 31:41.494
I love you, Louise. I truly do.

31:41.529 --> 31:43.834
Sir, I understand. Trust me,

31:43.847 --> 31:46.103
I've lost my share of women.

31:46.161 --> 31:48.320
Is there any chance

31:48.329 --> 31:50.422
you think you could feel the same?

31:50.704 --> 31:52.185
Sir, don't do this.

31:52.709 --> 31:54.332
Manfred, stop this.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.618
Life without you is not worth living.

31:57.639 --> 31:59.104
Don't do this, sir.

32:00.296 --> 32:01.721
I love you, Louise.

32:01.945 --> 32:05.886
You're honest and
intelligent and... decisive.

32:08.365 --> 32:10.433
The face of an angel.

32:15.810 --> 32:19.190
- I will always love you.
- Manfred!

32:22.764 --> 32:25.914
I honestly didn't know you
felt so deeply about me.

32:26.821 --> 32:28.551
I do.

32:30.829 --> 32:32.793
Then give me the gun.

32:41.297 --> 32:43.166
That wasn't so hard, was it, Constable?

32:43.919 --> 32:46.036
- Louise.
- Arrest him, will you?

32:46.069 --> 32:47.069
Louise!

32:47.344 --> 32:48.592
Sir! SIR!

32:52.409 --> 32:53.941
Did you write this?

32:54.611 --> 32:56.003
Yes, I did.

32:58.448 --> 33:01.715
"I will see you in the next life."

33:03.541 --> 33:05.454
That could be seen as a threat.

33:06.031 --> 33:07.790
That was not my intent. I...

33:08.021 --> 33:10.088
I was trying to say goodbye.

33:13.381 --> 33:15.332
Am I going to jail?

33:17.191 --> 33:18.444
No.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.963
You are going to see my wife.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.272
Your wife?

33:26.047 --> 33:28.191
She is a psychiatrist,

33:28.219 --> 33:30.534
and I believe she can help you.

33:32.892 --> 33:35.893
Life is a precious gift, sir.

33:37.388 --> 33:39.587
I would hate to see you waste it.

33:51.235 --> 33:52.737
Are you charging him?

33:52.770 --> 33:54.353
Not as yet.

33:54.386 --> 33:57.162
So, the person intending to
kill me may still be at large.

33:57.195 --> 34:00.356
- Mr. Banks remains in custody.
- And do you think he did it?

34:00.714 --> 34:02.165
I don't know.

34:02.836 --> 34:05.007
You made it sound so easy in your book.

34:05.618 --> 34:06.888
You've read it?

34:07.013 --> 34:09.449
- Professional obligation, I assure you.
- Miss Cherry,

34:09.485 --> 34:11.621
we are in the middle of
an investigation here.

34:11.627 --> 34:13.821
And is Mr. Elliot a suspect?

34:14.431 --> 34:17.080
Mr. Elliot nearly took his own life.

34:17.135 --> 34:19.395
He cares for you deeply.

34:20.978 --> 34:23.183
Are you suggesting
I'm to blame for this?

34:23.268 --> 34:24.873
Is that what you think, Detective?

34:24.900 --> 34:27.703
That I should indulge any man
who shows an interest in me,

34:27.719 --> 34:29.627
regardless of what my
feelings on the matter are?

34:29.650 --> 34:31.889
No, of course not,
but there is no reason

34:31.908 --> 34:34.058
to be completely devoid of sympathy.

34:34.678 --> 34:37.581
I harmed Mr. Elliot in no way.

34:39.020 --> 34:41.063
- Let's go, George.
- Mm.

34:41.431 --> 34:45.237
That was a most interesting conversation
we had last night, Constable.

34:48.293 --> 34:50.147
What are we doing here, sir?

34:50.224 --> 34:52.428
I mean, Mr. Elliot seemed quite earnest

34:52.434 --> 34:54.510
when he said he never intended
on harming Miss Cherry.

34:54.534 --> 34:57.139
He did, but he is a
disturbed individual.

34:57.139 --> 34:58.977
Just because he didn't
want to kill her today

34:58.992 --> 35:01.370
doesn't mean he didn't
plot to do so last week.

35:02.032 --> 35:04.907
Right. I'm not sure which desk is his.

35:05.396 --> 35:06.876
Search them all.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.321
How did the reading go last night, sir?

35:18.672 --> 35:21.751
It was a less than resounding success.

35:23.054 --> 35:24.647
They didn't like the book?

35:24.878 --> 35:27.781
I didn't quite get to
the content of the book.

35:27.990 --> 35:31.003
I thought I'd give them an
introduction to fingermarks.

35:31.574 --> 35:33.730
Well, that may have been a mistake.

35:33.768 --> 35:36.132
I'm coming to a similar conclusion.

35:39.860 --> 35:41.426
George?

35:44.147 --> 35:45.544
What's this?

35:46.412 --> 35:49.546
A schematic of Mr. Langston's
electric typewriter.

35:49.733 --> 35:51.387
What would it be doing here?

35:52.613 --> 35:54.795
Find out whose desk this is.

35:59.546 --> 36:03.783
- Why am I here?
- I wanted to speak with a real journalist.

36:03.855 --> 36:07.917
Louise Cherry's writing is a bit
too sensationalist for my tastes.

36:08.637 --> 36:11.508
- It certainly hasn't hurt her.
- No.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.652
But it has hurt others,

36:13.691 --> 36:15.344
yourself included.

36:15.522 --> 36:18.123
You work in this business,
you develop a thick skin.

36:19.095 --> 36:21.217
She took your job

36:21.245 --> 36:25.015
as senior reporter and columnist

36:25.055 --> 36:27.056
when the Telegraph took her on. Correct?

36:27.090 --> 36:28.627
That is correct.

36:28.752 --> 36:31.305
Prior to that, you had quite
an illustrious career...

36:31.321 --> 36:33.596
overseas covering the Boer War,

36:33.630 --> 36:36.098
senior parliamentary correspondent.

36:36.869 --> 36:39.189
Are you planning to write
my biography, Detective?

36:40.926 --> 36:44.696
But it is true that you went from
reporting on matters of significance

36:44.707 --> 36:48.781
to writing about typing
contests and the like.

36:48.906 --> 36:51.034
Your point, sir?

36:51.584 --> 36:54.520
It would only be human
nature for you to be envious

36:54.564 --> 36:57.687
- of your colleague's success.
- "Success"?

36:58.321 --> 37:00.596
That depends on what criterion you use.

37:00.629 --> 37:02.778
How would you describe it, Mr. Leonard?

37:03.212 --> 37:07.248
Louise Cherry caters to the
basest instincts of human nature.

37:07.633 --> 37:10.162
She feeds her readers' prurient interest

37:10.184 --> 37:12.360
in stories of immorality and depravity.

37:12.418 --> 37:14.357
That is not journalism.

37:14.482 --> 37:17.907
It is simply raking up muck
in order to sell newspapers.

37:18.845 --> 37:22.413
- What would you do differently?
- What I did, Detective,

37:22.468 --> 37:24.463
is report the facts and allow my readers

37:24.496 --> 37:26.106
to come to their own conclusions.

37:26.370 --> 37:29.185
I treated them as intelligent beings.

37:30.020 --> 37:32.455
I don't hate Louise Cherry
for what she did to me.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.990
I hate her for what she's
doing to my profession.

37:42.542 --> 37:45.134
How did these come to
be in your possession?

37:45.544 --> 37:47.518
I found them in your desk.

37:48.073 --> 37:50.840
I got them from a man I
interviewed some months ago.

37:50.874 --> 37:53.581
- Mr. Langston?
- No.

37:53.763 --> 37:55.533
Are... are you sure?

37:55.572 --> 37:58.661
Because Mr. Langston stated
that he was the only one

37:58.682 --> 38:01.283
in possession of any
plans to his machine.

38:01.408 --> 38:03.152
Then he lied to you.

38:03.186 --> 38:05.354
I got them from an associate of his.

38:05.847 --> 38:08.552
- Mr. Muloney?
- Yes.

38:08.998 --> 38:12.796
He wanted me to write an article
on Mr. Langston's theft of his idea.

38:13.895 --> 38:16.575
- But you didn't.
- I had no proof

38:16.649 --> 38:19.244
other than his accusations,
and that is no proof at all.

38:21.102 --> 38:23.450
So, you knew that the machine worked.

38:23.758 --> 38:26.282
You also knew about the
contest, the contestants,

38:26.309 --> 38:29.111
and the fact that Louise
Cherry had entered.

38:29.145 --> 38:32.982
Yes. That nicely sums up my
professional life right now.

38:33.016 --> 38:35.203
I can also tell you what
Mrs. Millicent Findleson

38:35.252 --> 38:37.419
is making for the
exhibition baking contest:

38:37.485 --> 38:39.486
her world-renowned apple tartlets.

38:39.508 --> 38:42.356
Apparently, best served with
a dollop of clotted cream.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.743
So, you knew that Louise
Cherry had the ability

38:46.787 --> 38:50.470
to reach the necessary letter
that would trigger the device,

38:50.673 --> 38:53.587
had she not sustained an injury.

38:59.030 --> 39:01.266
I also found these in your desk.

39:04.262 --> 39:05.980
And as you can see,

39:06.105 --> 39:08.494
the charge would not have
been sufficient to kill her.

39:08.883 --> 39:11.615
No, but it was sufficient
to kill Ivor Linwood,

39:11.740 --> 39:15.693
- a man with a heart condition.
- That was not my intention.

39:15.742 --> 39:18.299
No, but it was the
result of your actions.

39:18.315 --> 39:21.284
- I said I didn't mean to harm...
- But you did!

39:25.028 --> 39:28.496
You will be charged with
manslaughter, Mr. Leonard.

39:29.755 --> 39:31.839
Is there anything you wish to say?

39:33.476 --> 39:36.912
What happens to truth when Louise
Cherry and her kind take over?

39:36.947 --> 39:39.480
When the public trusts the
press even less than politicians?

39:39.513 --> 39:41.134
How are we to find truth in anything?

39:41.551 --> 39:43.443
And what happens to us then?

39:56.688 --> 40:00.352
And... stop! Time's up.

40:07.698 --> 40:11.383
87 words, 1 mistake, total score 85.

40:11.421 --> 40:14.522
Miss Bronson is
currently in first place.

40:15.545 --> 40:17.671
85!

40:19.283 --> 40:23.241
And our final two contestants:
Constable George Crabtree,

40:23.263 --> 40:25.588
then Miss Louise Cherry.

40:25.665 --> 40:27.081
Constable.

40:37.631 --> 40:38.980
Ready?

40:39.337 --> 40:40.816
Begin!

41:02.493 --> 41:06.284
And... stop! Time's up.

41:13.332 --> 41:17.003
Miss Cherry is the winner
with 88 words per minute.

41:17.866 --> 41:20.119
- Thank you!
- Well done.

41:26.986 --> 41:29.147
Well done. Well done.

41:30.407 --> 41:32.551
Yes, well, I knew I was going to win.

41:32.606 --> 41:35.325
Second place. That's
nothing to sneeze at, George.

41:35.350 --> 41:37.418
I dearly would have
liked to beat her, sir.

41:37.475 --> 41:39.854
I'm sure you're not the first
person to say that, George.

41:39.912 --> 41:41.722
- Julia!
- I'm joking.

41:41.927 --> 41:43.017
Excuse me.

41:43.259 --> 41:45.370
- You did your best, George.
- I did.

41:45.405 --> 41:47.037
The thing is there's a
big difference between

41:47.059 --> 41:49.610
doing your best and being the best.

41:52.100 --> 41:53.901
I wanted to let you
know I read your book.

41:54.896 --> 41:56.114
You did?

41:56.239 --> 41:58.154
I was wondering if you'd
like me to review it.

41:58.176 --> 42:00.551
I do have a considerable readership.

42:01.655 --> 42:04.065
That would be wonderful.

42:04.408 --> 42:07.490
As long as you don't expect
any special favours for it.

42:07.523 --> 42:08.939
Not at all, Detective.

42:09.064 --> 42:12.593
It's just my feeling that good
writing should be recognized.

42:13.728 --> 42:14.922
Walk me out?

42:16.275 --> 42:17.491
Of course.

42:18.166 --> 42:19.460
You didn't say anything.

42:19.585 --> 42:21.338
Oh, I think I said plenty.

42:32.174 --> 42:33.367
Oh, George?

42:33.492 --> 42:35.015
A moment of your time.

42:37.060 --> 42:40.843
And Mr. Clements has agreed your
name will appear on the cover

42:40.865 --> 42:42.716
of all subsequent printings.

42:43.064 --> 42:45.119
Oh... you don't have to do that!

42:45.153 --> 42:46.828
- We do.
- Well, we do.

42:46.903 --> 42:49.123
We wouldn't have a book
without you, George.

42:49.885 --> 42:51.358
Well, in that case,

42:51.393 --> 42:53.588
I'd hazard the two of you
have some real work to do!

42:53.817 --> 42:54.817
"Work"?

42:55.079 --> 42:58.275
To ensure a second printing, sir!
I mean, after all, fingermarks?

42:58.602 --> 43:00.893
In retrospect, that may not have been...

43:00.915 --> 43:03.070
Not exactly the most riveting spectacle.

43:03.422 --> 43:07.142
Perhaps you could coach us, George?

43:07.433 --> 43:09.878
Yes. Yes, perhaps I could.

43:10.072 --> 43:12.022
What you need is something a few of us

43:12.042 --> 43:14.409
in the industry call razzle-dazzle.

43:14.417 --> 43:15.992
If you're going to
demonstrate something,

43:16.014 --> 43:17.641
demonstrate something exciting!

43:17.672 --> 43:20.434
Like the Truthizer, sir!
Or your Capacitor gun.

43:20.469 --> 43:22.201
You could zap somebody right on stage!

43:22.245 --> 43:24.048
And Doctor, perhaps you could...

43:24.092 --> 43:26.093
x-ray members of the audience

43:26.110 --> 43:28.137
or show how common household items

43:28.163 --> 43:29.906
can be combined to make deadly poisons,

43:29.928 --> 43:31.568
- or kill a rat or something!
- Oh.

43:31.599 --> 43:33.454
As far as passages from the book goes,

43:33.485 --> 43:35.869
perhaps we should hire
an actor to read it!

43:35.930 --> 43:38.965
After all, I don't think anybody
really wants to hear from the writer.
