WEBVTT

00:16.380 --> 00:20.000
I can't take the sun...

01:51.780 --> 01:54.890
Looks like we're in the Zuland Plains.

01:55.230 --> 01:58.190
Um, we should see it soon.

01:58.540 --> 02:00.060
Oh, there!

02:00.450 --> 02:02.610
Wow! It's Mt. Fuji!

02:02.610 --> 02:04.390
Huh? Where?

02:05.540 --> 02:06.800
It's the spirit mountain of Fuji!

02:06.800 --> 02:09.090
It really is huge!

02:09.090 --> 02:10.050
Look!

02:10.050 --> 02:11.970
There's something over there 
that looks like a cow!

02:11.970 --> 02:14.030
Really? Where?

02:14.280 --> 02:17.940
Ah, I think that's a green elk herd.

02:17.940 --> 02:19.300
Are they dangerous?

02:19.300 --> 02:20.680
We'll be fine.

02:20.680 --> 02:24.570
There's some distance between us, 
and they're said to be calm.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.770
They're so cute!

02:27.770 --> 02:29.670
They really look just like cows.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.640
I've heard they're delicious.

02:35.710 --> 02:41.680
<b>The Midday Vampire</b>

02:38.110 --> 02:39.780
The Midday Vampire.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.390
The path here seems to be curving a little.

02:46.390 --> 02:48.670
It runs along the coast.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.690
There's so much grass, 
I can't see the ocean at all.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.500
But you can kind of smell the salt air, can't you?

02:59.310 --> 03:02.100
I'm not sure, honestly.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.900
Hey, didn't Shiroe say this road was...

03:07.480 --> 03:08.560
The East Sea Road.

03:09.140 --> 03:11.560
That's what this used to be called.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.600
It was one of the Five Routes.

03:14.600 --> 03:18.970
It began in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, and it 
became an important trade route.

03:20.690 --> 03:24.640
Today, the East Sea Road 
is called "National Route 1,"

03:24.640 --> 03:26.330
and many roads branch off of it.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.260
If you follow it all the way, 
it'll take you to Osaka.

03:29.260 --> 03:30.060
Osaka!

03:30.430 --> 03:32.960
Oh, you mean Minami.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.120
So the roads are connected in this world, too.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.070
Yeah.

03:37.460 --> 03:41.420
This might be the fastest route 
to the Redstone Mountains.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.610
I've never really thought about 
the roads that way before.

03:49.900 --> 03:52.080
Me, neither.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.440
Shiroe is so amazing...

03:54.440 --> 03:55.970
He knows so much stuff.

03:56.510 --> 03:57.390
Okay!

03:57.390 --> 04:00.560
While I'm here, I'm gonna have an adventure, 
and learn all kinds of things!

04:03.000 --> 04:05.350
Think it's about time for lunch?

04:05.830 --> 04:07.600
Sounds great!

04:08.570 --> 04:10.590
This is good!

04:10.590 --> 04:14.630
The chief's ham sandwiches are so good!

04:15.800 --> 04:17.650
No objection, whatsoever.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.730
Hey, you two!

04:20.910 --> 04:23.340
Leave some for us, okay?

04:23.740 --> 04:25.280
That's right.

04:27.140 --> 04:28.200
Hey!

04:28.200 --> 04:30.560
We're almost to Kalbe.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.510
What should we do?

04:31.510 --> 04:32.590
Stop there?

04:32.590 --> 04:34.720
Let's keep going.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.460
The weather's nice.

04:36.460 --> 04:40.160
Let's have Danish and Croissant 
work a little harder.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.740
They're up for it.

04:44.740 --> 04:46.120
We can keep going!

04:46.120 --> 04:47.870
Let's do our best!

04:47.870 --> 04:48.890
Yeah.

04:49.230 --> 04:52.490
The path opens before Rundel Haus Code!

04:52.990 --> 04:56.610
Okay, let's get going before it gets dark!

04:56.610 --> 04:57.800
Yeah!

05:11.480 --> 05:12.960
Wh-What happened?

05:14.540 --> 05:16.480
The time limit ran out!

05:16.480 --> 05:18.550
For the Twin Horse Flute of Lyman!

05:18.550 --> 05:20.400
Oh, right...

05:20.400 --> 05:23.290
It was six hours a day, wasn't it?

05:27.330 --> 05:29.840
Why didn't anyone realize that, anyway?

05:29.840 --> 05:31.270
You're right.

05:31.270 --> 05:34.060
Still, just because the time limit ran out,

05:34.060 --> 05:37.150
they didn't have to run away so fast.

05:37.150 --> 05:38.310
That's right.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.320
They ate carrots out of my hand.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.130
They ate my cabbage, too.

05:44.130 --> 05:46.200
They really have no sense of human gratitude!

05:46.600 --> 05:47.780
Well, they're horses.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.400
Even horses...

05:49.720 --> 05:50.570
Horses?

05:50.930 --> 05:54.130
Then would they have horse gratitude, 
rather than human gratitude?

05:58.110 --> 06:02.010
The horses ran off, but this is kind of nice.

06:02.010 --> 06:02.830
Yeah.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.800
Hey, where are we?

06:05.800 --> 06:09.830
Somewhere between the 
Kalbe Inn and Wilistoria Village.

06:09.830 --> 06:13.430
Without them, we can't go on...

06:15.880 --> 06:17.790
We'll have to camp.

06:17.790 --> 06:20.080
Yeah, we'll just have to do it.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.440
Leave the cooking to me.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.070
This is where an adventurer really shines.

06:25.070 --> 06:27.320
Being an adventurer has nothing to do with this.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.230
We're camping out!

06:29.230 --> 06:30.820
Yeah!

06:54.750 --> 06:57.180
Let's eat!

06:58.860 --> 06:59.900
This is good.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.270
Yeah, it's really good.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.180
It's just a little...

07:04.180 --> 07:05.330
The salt flavor is...

07:05.910 --> 07:06.790
Also...

07:06.790 --> 07:07.790
Rudy!

07:09.610 --> 07:12.250
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

07:12.250 --> 07:16.090
When I'm with Nyanta, I can make it just fine...

07:16.090 --> 07:17.700
You just haven't practiced enough.

07:17.700 --> 07:18.750
Don't worry about it.

07:19.240 --> 07:23.850
The chief would say, "You simply 
need to improve, little by little."

07:23.850 --> 07:25.000
Right?

07:25.450 --> 07:27.510
He's right, Serara.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.010
I wish we had a cooking skill.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.640
Sorry to keep relying on you, Serara!

07:35.600 --> 07:37.120
That's right.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.270
I need to keep a hold of myself.

07:39.670 --> 07:42.460
I've got the Newlywed's Apron Dress, after all!

07:42.460 --> 07:46.210
I need to do my best for Nyanta 
and for everyone else!

07:51.150 --> 07:54.780
Looks like the next place we 
can stop is the town of Sazan.

07:54.780 --> 07:56.440
How long will it take to get there?

07:56.440 --> 07:59.700
If we can only use the horses for six hours a day,

07:59.700 --> 08:01.860
it could take about three days.

08:01.860 --> 08:05.930
Why is this road so twisty?

08:05.930 --> 08:08.760
I wish it would just go straight.

08:08.760 --> 08:12.980
Yeah, but as long as I get to 
travel with everyone like this,

08:12.980 --> 08:15.010
I don't care if it takes a long time.

08:15.640 --> 08:22.200
I think Shiroe and the others sent us 
on this trip to teach us this stuff.

08:23.260 --> 08:24.600
You're great, Minori.

08:26.590 --> 08:30.280
I feel like you've really grown up 
from the person you used to be.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.420
Have I?

08:40.200 --> 08:44.830
I thought I'd grown up with you, 
but I guess I have a long way to go.

08:45.460 --> 08:46.850
That's not true.

08:47.350 --> 08:50.590
You saved me back there.

08:51.770 --> 08:56.400
I can do my best because you've always 
been with me since I came to this world.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.120
Well, I'm your big brother.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.750
I'm your big sister!

09:01.750 --> 09:03.720
No, I'm older!

09:03.720 --> 09:04.800
No, it's me!

09:04.800 --> 09:05.610
No, I am!

09:05.610 --> 09:07.040
And I'm taller!

09:07.040 --> 09:08.820
That doesn't matter!

09:12.010 --> 09:15.290
It's been three days since they left on their trip.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.630
I hope they aren't getting homesick.

09:18.630 --> 09:19.950
Aww...

09:19.950 --> 09:22.630
I'm sure they're having a great 
time, like it's a field trip.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.210
They may be saying they don't want to come back.

09:26.450 --> 09:28.460
That would be a problem in itself.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.940
You're looking pale again.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.290
Am I?

09:35.290 --> 09:36.310
Yes.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.470
You're also glaring, Rieze.

09:39.110 --> 09:40.690
You look just like my lord.

09:41.610 --> 09:44.340
Don't get too stubborn.

09:45.030 --> 09:45.820
Right.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.020
Is it hard without the scary glasses guy?

09:49.420 --> 09:51.080
Yes, it is.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.000
I realized how much I depended upon my lord.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.770
For the moment, D.D.D. is stable,

09:57.770 --> 10:00.780
but we don't know what will happen in the future.

10:03.050 --> 10:05.970
I'm sure I'm causing a lot of problems for people,

10:05.970 --> 10:07.660
and I will probably cause more.

10:08.090 --> 10:10.240
You don't need to worry about it.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.150
Everyone knows it's rough.

10:14.150 --> 10:17.810
Shiroe will do something.

10:18.830 --> 10:21.010
My lord won't think of it as a bother.

10:21.410 --> 10:23.430
He'll help you of his own free will.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.270
Of course, so will I.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.610
That's right.

10:26.610 --> 10:29.550
You don't need to worry about us now!

10:30.140 --> 10:31.610
We're friends, after all.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.110
Why are you laughing now?!

10:36.500 --> 10:39.030
Isn't that what being friends is?

10:39.030 --> 10:40.770
It's kind of strange...

10:43.030 --> 10:48.000
If we were in the old world, I'm sure 
we never could've been friends.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.000
You might be right.

10:52.630 --> 10:53.400
No,

10:53.400 --> 10:55.510
that isn't true.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.770
It's said that the cute are drawn to one another!

10:58.770 --> 11:00.740
I would've met you two, no matter what!

11:00.740 --> 11:02.970
Henrietta, stop rubbing your 
cheek against mine!

11:02.970 --> 11:05.020
We didn't need that kind of assurance!

11:08.780 --> 11:10.150
Akatsuki!

11:10.150 --> 11:11.400
Oh, no!

11:14.080 --> 11:17.900
Is that a Teaching for a ninja 
body-swapping technique?

11:19.110 --> 11:20.810
It's just a doll.

11:30.630 --> 11:31.500
The sunset!

11:31.960 --> 11:33.790
It's so pretty!

11:33.790 --> 11:35.000
I can see it.

11:35.350 --> 11:36.630
That's the town of Sazan!

11:37.610 --> 11:38.990
We're almost there.

11:43.740 --> 11:47.180
Our musician says she'd like to play here tonight.

11:47.910 --> 11:51.690
We won't cause any trouble, so can 
you provide a place to perform?

11:52.040 --> 11:54.180
A forty-two, huh?

11:54.710 --> 11:58.940
But adventurer bards are pricey...

11:59.260 --> 12:01.040
I don't need any payment!

12:01.040 --> 12:03.640
If you'll just let me play here, that's enough.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.440
Please.

12:04.710 --> 12:05.950
Please!

12:07.550 --> 12:09.120
Nice job, Rudy!

12:09.120 --> 12:12.350
We get to perform, and we can 
stay free for the night!

12:14.280 --> 12:16.600
This is what I am capable of.

12:17.330 --> 12:21.130
...is what I'd like to say, but it's 
thanks to Miss Isuzu's passion.

12:21.570 --> 12:22.880
Rudy...

12:23.250 --> 12:25.030
Don't worry about me.

12:25.380 --> 12:28.040
You guys perform to your hearts' content.

12:29.390 --> 12:30.300
Okay.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.730
<i>I really have learned a lot on this journey.</i>

12:36.430 --> 12:39.400
<i>Even about the road we took to get here...</i>

12:40.150 --> 12:43.560
<i>I wondered why there were 
so many twists and turns.</i>

12:44.760 --> 12:46.800
<i>But when I traveled it on a carriage,</i>

12:46.800 --> 12:48.930
<i>I saw that there were forests and hills,</i>

12:48.930 --> 12:50.660
<i>so we couldn't just go straight.</i>

12:51.620 --> 12:55.170
<i>The road goes around all those things 
to make it easier for people and carriages.</i>

12:55.690 --> 13:00.610
<i>And this town was born so that, when you 
started to feel tired, you could rest.</i>

13:01.740 --> 13:04.180
<i>It was probably inevitable.</i>

13:06.290 --> 13:09.790
<i>Don't be afraid of the boredom.</i>

13:09.790 --> 13:13.280
<i>Let's... Let's... Let's go outside!</i>

13:13.280 --> 13:15.190
<i>I think Rudy is amazing.</i>

13:15.960 --> 13:19.210
<i>When I wasn't able to play soccer with everyone,</i>

13:19.710 --> 13:22.290
<i>I couldn't just watch with an expression like that.</i>

13:24.290 --> 13:29.550
<i>Will my twisty path culminate in a city somewhere?</i>

13:32.170 --> 13:33.700
I'm so tired...

13:33.700 --> 13:36.040
They loved it!

13:36.040 --> 13:38.530
The customers kept asking for another song.

13:38.530 --> 13:40.700
The encore calls wouldn't stop.

13:40.700 --> 13:41.920
Fantastic!

13:42.170 --> 13:43.100
Yeah.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.300
I knew it...

13:46.300 --> 13:47.890
They have a lot of energy.

13:47.890 --> 13:49.650
Too much energy.

13:49.650 --> 13:51.770
I wonder what they're talking about.

13:51.770 --> 13:53.430
Are you curious, Rudy?

13:54.040 --> 13:55.360
Not at all.

13:55.870 --> 13:59.790
I'm not such a boor as to be interested 
in a secret chat among ladies.

14:00.210 --> 14:05.650
I'm simply impressed that they never 
run out of things to discuss.

14:05.650 --> 14:07.070
That's because they're girls.

14:07.820 --> 14:12.190
I see... Because they're girls... I mean, ladies.

14:12.670 --> 14:17.080
Then is the reason that Miss Isuzu is so 
pure and innocent because she's a lady?

14:17.080 --> 14:18.580
Huh? Is she?

14:19.170 --> 14:23.210
She always wants to hug me and rub my hair!

14:23.710 --> 14:25.660
O-Oh...

14:25.660 --> 14:27.720
<i>I think she's just treating you like a dog.</i>

14:28.500 --> 14:31.880
Miss Isuzu doesn't act that way toward you.

14:32.190 --> 14:34.350
Does she simply not think I'm important?

14:38.390 --> 14:39.520
Don't laugh, Tohya!

14:39.520 --> 14:40.860
I'm serious!

14:41.360 --> 14:43.010
I'm sorry! Sorry!

14:43.010 --> 14:46.320
I think it might mean you're special.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.320
Special?

14:48.620 --> 14:49.570
Yeah.

14:51.850 --> 14:52.600
<i>Paw.</i>

14:53.490 --> 14:56.270
<i>You're my doggy, so you're special.</i>

14:58.420 --> 15:00.080
Hey! Why are you laughing?!

15:01.320 --> 15:05.250
When Isuzu thinks it's fun to be with you,

15:05.250 --> 15:07.090
that's what she does.

15:07.450 --> 15:09.180
Is that so?

15:09.180 --> 15:10.090
Yeah, yeah.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.270
But I think that's different from 
being especially beautiful,

15:13.270 --> 15:14.860
especially amazing,

15:14.860 --> 15:18.360
or especially magnificently strong!

15:18.890 --> 15:21.270
What does she think about me?

15:22.200 --> 15:23.840
If thinking about it won't help,

15:23.840 --> 15:25.240
let's get some sleep.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.910
That's not fair, Tohya!

15:26.910 --> 15:28.650
I'll get some sleep, too. Goodnight.

15:31.910 --> 15:33.840
Goodnight, Rudy.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.510
Today, we're going to cross into the Sakawa region.

15:41.510 --> 15:42.710
Sakawa?

15:42.710 --> 15:45.420
In the modern world, that's Odawara.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.350
They're famous for their fish paste.

15:47.350 --> 15:48.880
Oh, I see.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.640
We're going to follow this road 
to the ruined castle of Ariba.

15:53.290 --> 15:55.580
To get to our goal, the Redstone Mountains,

15:55.580 --> 15:59.890
we'll either go off the Sea Road past the 
Ariba ruins and onto a smaller road,

15:59.890 --> 16:03.630
or take a route that involves climbing mountains.

16:04.230 --> 16:09.060
Since this area is a rice paddy zone, 
there are nature-type monsters.

16:09.420 --> 16:14.470
Wild dogs, boars, and plant monsters 
live in the forests and mountains,

16:09.970 --> 16:11.470
<b>Wild Dog 
 Rank/ Field</b>

16:12.340 --> 16:14.110
<b>Boar (Mushroom) 
Rank/ Field</b>

16:14.470 --> 16:17.160
but they keep to themselves.

16:14.970 --> 16:16.320
<b>Triffid 
Rank/ Normal</b>

16:17.750 --> 16:23.940
And Shiroe said the monsters along the road 
have their levels kept way down.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.450
Then, even if we do run into one, we'll be fine.

16:28.450 --> 16:30.300
Let's just keep going.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.540
Okay, let's go!

16:32.540 --> 16:34.030
Yeah!

16:37.070 --> 16:38.740
Will this work?

16:39.200 --> 16:41.060
Yeah, it's fine.

16:41.450 --> 16:44.680
Sorry to have you take charge.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.420
I don't care.

16:47.420 --> 16:50.730
Isaac's actually looking forward to it.

16:50.730 --> 16:52.570
Don't talk like you know me.

16:53.130 --> 16:55.600
Anyway, so we have to train all the knights.

16:55.970 --> 16:58.260
How many levels should we raise them?

16:58.260 --> 17:00.290
Part of this is to forge friendships,

17:00.290 --> 17:02.580
so two or three is fine.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.580
That isn't very greedy.

17:04.910 --> 17:06.850
They're People of the Land.

17:06.850 --> 17:09.070
We can't be reckless with them.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.050
What a pain.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.970
Isaac...

17:13.510 --> 17:17.150
Were you planning on power-leveling?

17:17.150 --> 17:19.600
Yeah, that's easier.

17:19.970 --> 17:23.980
If we take the lead and fight high-level monsters,

17:23.980 --> 17:27.520
the lower-level guys will rise 
in level automatically.

17:28.430 --> 17:31.340
Their levels will go up, 
but they won't get stronger.

17:32.690 --> 17:35.020
You're so hard-headed, villain.

17:35.020 --> 17:37.620
We can just alternate between 
power-leveling and combat training.

17:38.130 --> 17:40.500
No, I'll even focus on training!

17:42.080 --> 17:45.320
<i>This is starting to sound really macho,</i>

17:45.640 --> 17:46.620
<i>but I guess it's okay.</i>

17:46.900 --> 17:50.500
Um, you still can't reach Crusty?

17:50.900 --> 17:51.870
No.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.760
He isn't responding on his Friend List, either.

17:54.470 --> 17:57.810
What is he doing that's so important, 
he'd ignore his guild?

17:58.200 --> 17:59.520
It could fall apart.

18:00.070 --> 18:04.020
Lately, lots of people are leaving D.D.D.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.620
Of course, it's actually surprising

18:06.620 --> 18:11.290
the guild's managed to stay on course 
for these past three months.

18:12.970 --> 18:14.630
Are you worried, villain?

18:15.060 --> 18:16.660
What about you, Isaac?

18:17.110 --> 18:18.690
I know him.

18:18.690 --> 18:22.770
He's either off playing somewhere or fighting.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.060
<i>I'm worried about D.D.D., but...</i>

18:28.350 --> 18:32.670
The number of people in 
Honesty has exceeded 1,250.

18:32.670 --> 18:35.360
This is above our previous record.

18:35.790 --> 18:36.680
But...

18:36.980 --> 18:39.620
The majority of the new 
members are basically leechers.

18:40.030 --> 18:43.430
They don't hunt or gather outside of Akihabara,

18:43.430 --> 18:47.180
and they don't do crafting or 
trading in town, either.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.940
Damned parasites.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.320
Th-There are people like that. But...

18:53.630 --> 18:57.730
These "people like that" are joining 
our guild and taking it easy.

18:57.730 --> 19:02.030
People in Akihabara and the guild 
are getting angry with them.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.930
It's only a matter of time 
before that rage explodes.

19:05.350 --> 19:08.080
Of course, I've shared our opinion 
with the Round Table.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.600
What can they do?

19:10.600 --> 19:12.540
I think we simply have to kick them out.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.610
Why not just limit who can join?

19:15.610 --> 19:17.090
We can't do that.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.020
The only reason Honesty maintains its influence

19:20.020 --> 19:22.450
and position on the Round Table

19:22.450 --> 19:26.100
is because we're the 
third-largest guild in Akihabara.

19:26.610 --> 19:31.480
If we lose that influence, we'll lose our 
ability to influence Akihabara politics.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.510
But I think it'd be healthier if the guild...

19:34.510 --> 19:38.990
No, the whole town of Akihabara went on a diet.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.290
Those are cherry blossoms, right?

19:50.290 --> 19:52.000
Nope...

19:52.000 --> 19:53.290
They're plums.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.970
They smell so nice...

20:01.680 --> 20:02.800
A river!

20:05.440 --> 20:06.910
Oh, boy...

20:06.910 --> 20:09.190
This won't be easy to cross.

20:09.590 --> 20:11.060
Let's look for a way around.

20:15.070 --> 20:16.940
Save us!

20:22.530 --> 20:23.200
That's...

20:23.790 --> 20:25.470
They're being chased by ogres!

20:25.470 --> 20:26.830
Get over there and keep them safe!

20:27.530 --> 20:28.450
Understood!

20:29.140 --> 20:33.110
<b>Man-Eating Demon 
Rank/ Normal</b>

20:29.970 --> 20:33.120
Enemy levels are 21, 22, and 21!

20:33.490 --> 20:34.240
Tohya!

20:34.240 --> 20:35.340
Right!

20:35.820 --> 20:38.570
Leave it to me!

20:40.800 --> 20:42.470
<i>Frost Spear!</i>

20:50.830 --> 20:52.100
Are you okay?

20:52.360 --> 20:53.220
Are you hurt?

20:53.220 --> 20:55.650
Don't let your guard down! 
There are fifteen adds!

20:57.630 --> 21:02.600
<b>Nightshade Serpent 
Rank/ Normal</b>

20:57.780 --> 20:59.550
Nightshade Serpents.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.750
Their average level is 40!

21:01.750 --> 21:03.210
And there are fifteen of them!

21:03.210 --> 21:04.990
They're a spirit-type monster.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.290
Dark spirits have either evil poison,

21:07.290 --> 21:10.420
or resistance to mind attacks and insta-kills.

21:11.110 --> 21:15.050
<i>Not only might we get hurt, 
but the People of the Land could, too!</i>

21:15.870 --> 21:16.540
I'll go!

21:19.580 --> 21:20.800
I'm not even touching them!

21:23.990 --> 21:24.550
Tohya!

21:32.640 --> 21:33.890
<i>Servant Summon...</i>

21:34.410 --> 21:35.890
<i>Princess Wraith!</i>

21:54.500 --> 21:56.000
Wow...

22:03.960 --> 22:06.510
Um, who are you?

22:06.820 --> 22:08.850
My name is Roe 2.

22:10.270 --> 22:11.600
A summoner.

22:12.350 --> 22:19.010
A traveling vampire, heading south, I suppose.

22:14.830 --> 22:20.360
<b>Roe 2 
Race/ Half-Alv 
Summoner, Lv. 90 
No Guild</b>

22:20.760 --> 22:22.350
A new person with glasses...

22:24.980 --> 22:28.450
I can't take the sun...

24:05.510 --> 24:07.070
"Call me 'big sister.'"

24:07.380 --> 24:11.700
Roe 2, a mysterious big sister who takes 
joy in being called "big sister."

24:12.220 --> 24:15.950
Tohya and the others enjoy their journey, 
even with the chaos she causes.

24:16.400 --> 24:19.390
They encounter a group of adventurers who fight

24:19.390 --> 24:21.500
to protect People of the Land from monsters.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.490
Next time: Odyssey Knights.

24:22.400 --> 24:29.990
<b>Odyssey Knights</b>

24:25.100 --> 24:26.950
I have friends to run with me.
