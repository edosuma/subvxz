00:53.915 --> 00:57.402
There is nothing a father
wouldn't do for his son.

00:57.402 --> 01:00.129
Your mother
never understood this.

01:00.129 --> 01:02.890
She looked at you
and saw a monster.

01:02.890 --> 01:05.065
I saw potential.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.551
When a bully took your money,
you took his eye.

01:08.551 --> 01:12.175
When they called you crazy,
you took their tongues.

01:12.175 --> 01:14.833
But I brought you here today.

01:14.833 --> 01:16.524
Was it generosity?

01:16.524 --> 01:18.630
Love?

01:18.630 --> 01:19.976
No.

01:19.976 --> 01:22.599
It's so what I built
doesn't die with me.

01:22.599 --> 01:24.360
So my legacy can live on,

01:24.360 --> 01:27.535
because a father and his son
is everything.

01:27.535 --> 01:30.055
I have a job that I can
only trust with one man.

01:30.055 --> 01:31.574
You.

01:31.574 --> 01:34.508
My most ruthless soldiers
were watching our cash houses,

01:34.508 --> 01:37.752
and they let this Dominic
Toretto burn what is mine.

01:37.752 --> 01:39.478
I'll kill Dominic Toretto.

01:40.617 --> 01:41.963
I'll kill 'em all.

01:41.963 --> 01:44.552
Kill them?
You'd show them mercy?

01:44.552 --> 01:45.933
No, my son.

01:45.933 --> 01:50.351
When suffering is owed,
never accept death as a payment.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.736
Make Toretto suffer.

02:11.545 --> 02:14.893
Now the work begins.

02:14.893 --> 02:16.619
And in there,

02:16.619 --> 02:20.450
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

02:21.658 --> 02:23.626
Let's get started.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.429
Shit!

04:46.976 --> 04:48.357
Hey, there's too many of them!

04:48.357 --> 04:50.186
- We're not gonna make it.
- You're right. We aren't.

04:50.842 --> 04:52.326
- You are.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.121
Now, you stick with the plan.

04:54.121 --> 04:55.812
It was always the plan.

05:47.174 --> 05:48.486
Get him.

B, no one starts
at the finish line.

07:18.921 --> 07:21.095
You got to have faith.

07:21.095 --> 07:22.787
Remember today's lesson.

07:22.787 --> 07:25.479
Find the line,

07:25.479 --> 07:27.481
feel the car,

07:27.481 --> 07:28.827
and let it fly.

07:28.827 --> 07:30.933
- It's okay to be afraid.

07:30.933 --> 07:33.211
Sometimes fear can be
the best teacher.

07:33.211 --> 07:34.764
I wasn't scared.

07:35.972 --> 07:37.664
- Everyone gets scared, son.
- You don't.

07:37.664 --> 07:39.597
You're not afraid of anything.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.601
We better hurry.

07:43.601 --> 07:45.499
- Great-Grandma just flew in.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.846
And she's making
her famous maduros.

07:47.846 --> 07:50.608
We got to get to those
before Uncle Roman does.

You're welcome.

08:18.705 --> 08:20.154
Now, you give it
about three, four days...

08:20.154 --> 08:21.501
- It never happens instantly.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.261
- Wait, what?
Hmm.

08:23.261 --> 08:24.573
Wow.

08:24.573 --> 08:25.919
Let me see
your profile picture again.

08:25.919 --> 08:27.196
He must have
put a filter on there.

08:27.196 --> 08:28.818
What are you guys looking at?

08:28.818 --> 08:30.337

Boy nosy.
- You drifting yet?

08:33.720 --> 08:34.962
I am.

08:34.962 --> 08:38.069
You should've seen us.
It was so cool, Mom.

08:38.069 --> 08:39.449
Hey!

08:39.449 --> 08:40.450
!¡Oye, familia!

08:40.450 --> 08:41.935
I am starving!

08:41.935 --> 08:43.626
- Come on.

08:43.626 --> 08:46.802
I also want a hug from
every single person in--

08:46.802 --> 08:48.182
Oh.

08:48.182 --> 08:49.770
- Ah.
- You see the line?

08:49.770 --> 08:51.565
We're all waiting in line
for this love, abuelita.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.602
- Oh, yeah.
- Wait till you taste this.

08:53.602 --> 08:54.706
It's really good.

08:54.706 --> 08:56.570
I put myself out for this one.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.020
- Oh.

09:01.610 --> 09:02.818
Okay, everybody pipe down, please.

09:02.818 --> 09:04.785
Abuelita would like
to say something.

09:05.890 --> 09:08.478
- Piping and downing, please.

09:08.478 --> 09:11.723
As I look out
at this wonderful family,

09:11.723 --> 09:17.073
I am filled with so much pride.

09:17.073 --> 09:20.525
The kind of pride that my son--
your father--

09:20.525 --> 09:22.423
would have enjoyed
if he were here.

09:22.423 --> 09:26.324
I know that this road
has been very hard

09:26.324 --> 09:29.085
and also not fair.

09:30.535 --> 09:32.606
And yet here you are,

09:32.606 --> 09:35.229
despite all of the odds,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.141
It is a legacy that will go on
for generations.

09:50.141 --> 09:51.591
No one can take it away.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.523
Not now.

09:53.523 --> 09:54.973
Not ever.

09:54.973 --> 09:58.045
- Yeah!

♪ Costa Rica...

10:07.020 --> 10:09.816
Hey, these new Nikes, man.
Stop playing! Goddamn...

10:09.816 --> 10:12.266
Come on, Roman.
The agency put you in charge,

10:12.266 --> 10:13.440
and you said I get to drive.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.269
See, what I really need

10:15.269 --> 10:16.374
is I need your brain.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.377
Words Roman Pearce
has never said.

10:20.792 --> 10:22.483
So talk me through it again.
I need details.

10:22.483 --> 10:25.141
Yeah, the agency got a tip on
some stolen military hardware.

10:25.141 --> 10:27.281
Tomorrow, a next-gen
quantum computer chip

10:27.281 --> 10:29.525
will be transported
through the streets of Rome,

10:29.525 --> 10:30.699
and they need us to steal it.

10:30.699 --> 10:32.632
I checked Roman's intel.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.667
It's legit.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.737
Of course it's legit.

10:34.737 --> 10:36.083
We're talking 'bout Rome.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.327
Rome. Roman.

10:38.327 --> 10:39.742
Come on, man.

10:39.742 --> 10:41.330
That's like planning a heist
in my backyard.

10:41.330 --> 10:43.781
Only thing you know about Rome
is "ro-man" noodles.

10:43.781 --> 10:45.714
One thing
you didn't explain to us is:

10:45.714 --> 10:47.198
Why the hell
do we need a RC car,

10:47.198 --> 10:50.719
a gold Lamborghini
and 12 tanks of laughing gas?

10:50.719 --> 10:52.099
Yes, I'm in,
'cause you are definitely

10:52.099 --> 10:53.583
going to need
all the brains you can get.

10:53.583 --> 10:54.999
You up to something.

10:54.999 --> 10:56.621
Hey, Rome... -
Don't talk to me, man.

10:56.621 --> 10:57.967
Don't talk to me.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.555
- All right.
- You know what?

10:59.555 --> 11:02.869
The disrespect
is gon' have to stop.

11:02.869 --> 11:04.560

practicing my leadership voice.

11:11.705 --> 11:14.570
I see what's going on.

11:14.570 --> 11:16.468
Tej, you think you slick, bro.

11:16.468 --> 11:17.607
Look at you.

11:17.607 --> 11:18.954
Spying on me.

11:18.954 --> 11:20.749
What's up with
this old boat anchor?

11:20.749 --> 11:21.922
No fuel injection.

11:21.922 --> 11:23.372
I mean, I'd expect
something bigger

11:23.372 --> 11:24.649
and better from you, Dom.

11:24.649 --> 11:26.030
Little B and I
are building it together.

11:26.030 --> 11:28.860
The carburetor
forces him to listen.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.379
That's the problem nowadays.

11:30.379 --> 11:32.105
- Nobody listens anymore.
- Well, you better watch out.

11:32.105 --> 11:34.901
Little man's gonna be
a better wrench than any of us

11:34.901 --> 11:36.212
by the time he's 12.

11:36.212 --> 11:38.007
I mean, that's the whole point,
isn't it?

11:39.629 --> 11:41.528
Pass it down.

11:41.528 --> 11:43.806
Each generation
better than the last.

11:45.049 --> 11:46.395
That's true.

11:46.395 --> 11:47.810
That's fatherhood.

11:49.156 --> 11:51.952

the two of us popping gas trucks

- in the D.R., huh?
- We sure did.

11:54.058 --> 11:56.750
Those were some tough times.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.994
Those were some great times.

Oh, you...
Y-Y'all was in a meeting?

12:07.588 --> 12:09.245

12:10.868 --> 12:12.628
Han, let's go, man.

12:12.628 --> 12:15.596
Roman asked if he could
lead this mission.

12:15.596 --> 12:17.322
How could I tell him no?

12:17.322 --> 12:20.325

17:33.569 --> 17:37.194
Honestly, I always thought
it was me.

17:37.194 --> 17:39.541
So that was
kind of disappointing.

17:42.854 --> 17:45.443
<i>He came to my door.</i>

17:50.138 --> 17:52.450
<i>He let himself in.</i>

17:54.107 --> 17:56.420
They say
when you're facing death,

17:56.420 --> 18:00.113
your life flashes
before your eyes.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.081
Are they right?

18:06.913 --> 18:09.088
I'd start with who you are.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.297
A question most can't answer
in a lifetime.

18:11.297 --> 18:12.746
You have three seconds.

18:15.853 --> 18:17.303
Before you bleed out
on my couch,

18:17.303 --> 18:19.719
you might want to explain
why you're here.

18:19.719 --> 18:22.584
I'm here

18:22.584 --> 18:24.896
because the enemy

18:24.896 --> 18:27.727
of my enemy

18:27.727 --> 18:28.797
is you.

18:28.797 --> 18:30.833
<i>I am a man with</i>

18:30.833 --> 18:32.904
no name.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.699
Heir to nothing.

18:34.699 --> 18:37.668
And I'm here for
the same reasons you are.

18:37.668 --> 18:39.601
Dominic Toretto.

18:39.601 --> 18:40.981
You want to kill Dom?

18:40.981 --> 18:42.880
Line's around the block.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.675
No, no, no.

18:44.675 --> 18:49.162
Never accept death
when suffering is owed.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.820
But I need your help.

18:51.820 --> 18:54.547
Your toys and your tech.

18:54.547 --> 18:56.135
All your boys.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.447
'Cause you're either with me
or you're...

18:59.828 --> 19:01.243
I don't play well with others.

19:01.243 --> 19:03.176
Then you'll have to watch
who you love most die.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.729
You're looking at
who I love most.

19:04.729 --> 19:07.939
You thought you could use
my own move against me?

19:07.939 --> 19:10.183
I wasn't talking to you.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.840
I was talking to Zeke.

19:12.910 --> 19:14.843
Amir.

19:16.672 --> 19:18.640
Kevin's dad.

19:23.023 --> 19:24.404
Who could it be?

19:33.655 --> 19:35.519
Cute kids.

19:40.593 --> 19:41.766
Ooh.

19:46.357 --> 19:47.669
They all had something to take

19:47.669 --> 19:50.050
except that poor bastard.

19:50.050 --> 19:52.121
Not even a kitty cat.

19:52.121 --> 19:55.677
The rest of you have a choice.

19:55.677 --> 19:59.439
Me or...

20:04.410 --> 20:07.309
You want to control the world.

20:09.035 --> 20:11.934
I just want to punish it.

20:18.147 --> 20:19.908
I will remember this.

20:19.908 --> 20:22.048
I think everyone will.

20:24.361 --> 20:27.087
Huh. I need someone to help me
operate this, don't I?

20:27.087 --> 20:28.882
Nerds?

20:28.882 --> 20:30.194
Come with me.

20:30.194 --> 20:31.540
All right, you know what to do

20:31.540 --> 20:33.439
if you want to see
your families again.

20:33.439 --> 20:34.750
Ciao.

20:43.552 --> 20:44.415
Kill her.

20:46.831 --> 20:48.039
Shit.

20:50.628 --> 20:52.941
Did you think I would trust you?

20:57.670 --> 21:01.329
It is hard finding good help
these days.

22:53.855 --> 22:55.891
There's a war coming.

22:57.997 --> 23:00.724
The sides are being chosen.

23:02.967 --> 23:06.039
And everyone you love
will be destroyed.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.993
Lost six pints of blood.

23:28.993 --> 23:30.547
Normal person dies at four.

23:30.547 --> 23:32.134
We're shipping her back
to our black site.

23:32.134 --> 23:34.758
- She may not make it.
- But did her story check out?

23:34.758 --> 23:36.415
We confirmed
the shooting downtown,

23:36.415 --> 23:37.968
but her tech wasn't there.

23:37.968 --> 23:40.557
And whoever took it
now has an electronic arsenal.

23:40.557 --> 23:43.629
- You've alerted your people?
- Yeah, Mia and Brian are safe.

23:43.629 --> 23:46.701
I tried to get in touch
with Roman, Tej, Ramsey, Han.

23:46.701 --> 23:49.945
- No answer.
- Any idea where they might be?

23:51.913 --> 23:54.053
In Rome.

23:54.053 --> 23:55.813
Working for you.

23:55.813 --> 23:58.713
Dom, we don't... we don't have
a mission in Rome.

23:59.817 --> 24:01.440
It's a setup.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.476
Shit.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.685
We're going to Rome.

24:05.685 --> 24:07.584
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

24:14.004 --> 24:18.457
Son, you and I will finish
that driving lesson.

24:19.319 --> 24:21.563
It's a promise.

24:23.220 --> 24:24.773
No matter what happens.

24:24.773 --> 24:27.224
And I always keep my promises.

37:08.950 --> 37:10.297
It's getting tricky, guys.

37:10.297 --> 37:12.160
I can't stay on him
for much longer.

37:12.160 --> 37:14.059
Ramsey, how deep is that river?

37:14.059 --> 37:16.164
The Tiber? Uh...

37:16.164 --> 37:17.614
Uh, 60 feet.

37:17.614 --> 37:19.202
I mean, the water could
smother the explosion,

37:19.202 --> 37:21.411
reduce its power
by ten times, maybe.

37:37.393 --> 37:39.567
Damn it!

37:40.499 --> 37:43.606
You missed me
by that much, baby!

37:47.782 --> 37:49.439
I lost him. He's gone.

37:49.439 --> 37:50.958
Damn!

37:50.958 --> 37:52.097
He's out of our reach.

37:52.097 --> 37:53.581
We can't jam the signal anymore.

37:53.581 --> 37:56.515
Bad news, Dom.
I'm back in business.

38:06.663 --> 38:08.700
You got 30 seconds to save Rome.

38:10.046 --> 38:14.637
<i>Dom, he armed the bomb,
and you're almost at the river.</i>

38:48.015 --> 38:50.155
15 seconds, Dom.

38:50.155 --> 38:52.364
Dom, listen to me.

38:52.364 --> 38:53.883
The Vatican's within
the blast radius.

38:53.883 --> 38:55.298
Get out of there.

38:55.298 --> 38:56.955
<i>You've done
everything you could.</i>

38:56.955 --> 38:58.681
Not everything.

39:06.274 --> 39:07.517
<i>Five.</i>

39:09.277 --> 39:10.934
<i>Four.</i>

39:13.040 --> 39:14.697
<i>Three.</i>

39:16.699 --> 39:18.839
<i>Two.</i>

39:19.840 --> 39:20.944
<i>One.</i>

40:01.295 --> 40:03.539
<i>What have we done?</i>

40:05.989 --> 40:10.856
Through your suffering,
I'll fulfill my destiny.

40:12.271 --> 40:14.653
Come find me.

40:14.653 --> 40:17.622
Your pain has just begun.

40:17.622 --> 40:19.313
I'll see you soon, Dom.

40:19.313 --> 40:20.901
<i>Breaking news from Italy.</i>

40:20.901 --> 40:24.076
The capital Rome has been hit
by a massive explosion.

40:28.736 --> 40:30.911
...to be
a large military weapon.

40:32.568 --> 40:33.603
The Vatican has sustained

40:33.603 --> 40:34.708
some structural damage.

40:34.708 --> 40:36.468
...but no lives were claimed.

40:37.814 --> 40:39.471
Authorities have identified
the terrorists as

40:39.471 --> 40:41.577
- these five individuals.

40:41.577 --> 40:44.234
...as these five individuals,
led by this man.

40:44.234 --> 40:45.960
- Dominic Toretto.
- Toretto. -Toretto.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.825
- Dominic Toretto.
Dominic Toretto.

40:48.825 --> 40:51.449
<i>Law enforcement is
working across borders,</i>

40:51.449 --> 40:53.623
mobilizing
an international fugitive hunt

40:53.623 --> 40:55.004
- of unprecedented scale.
I'm sorry, sir.

40:55.004 --> 40:57.109
- I don't know how she got in.
- I do.

40:57.109 --> 40:58.525
I stole your badge.

40:58.525 --> 41:01.251
I'm done with it now, though. Thanks.

41:01.251 --> 41:02.874
Well, if it isn't, um--

41:02.874 --> 41:04.496
Honestly, I-I don't know
what to call you.

41:04.496 --> 41:06.325
Little Miss Nobody?

41:06.325 --> 41:07.879
How about you call me
by my actual name?

41:07.879 --> 41:11.192
Last I heard, Tess, you were
running ops in Damascus.

41:11.192 --> 41:12.504
You think you can
walk in this room

41:12.504 --> 41:13.988
just 'cause your daddy's
an agency legend?

41:13.988 --> 41:15.680
I'm here because
someone needs to speak

41:15.680 --> 41:17.302
on behalf of the defense.

41:17.302 --> 41:19.718
What just happened in Rome
was an unmitigated disaster.

41:19.718 --> 41:21.409
Casualties were kept
to a minimum,

41:21.409 --> 41:22.756
but the impact was global.

41:22.756 --> 41:25.344
And what do you think
happened in Italy?

41:25.344 --> 41:28.693
Oh, sightseeing,
eating bucatini,

41:28.693 --> 41:30.729
- stealing a 20-kiloton bomb.
- Oh, come on, Aimes.

41:30.729 --> 41:33.318
That's bullshit
and you know it. -Careful, now.

41:33.318 --> 41:34.975
With Little Nobody
out of commission

41:34.975 --> 41:38.496
and your daddy in the wind,
you're talking to the new boss.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.532
Showtime.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.569
Los Angeles, 2001.

41:42.569 --> 41:45.054
Humble roots, local kids,

41:45.054 --> 41:47.746
street racers
who became hijackers.

41:47.746 --> 41:50.335
Graduated to
high-speed smuggling,

41:50.335 --> 41:51.923
mobile jailbreaks,
train robberies.

41:51.923 --> 41:54.822
If it could be done in a car,
they did it.

41:54.822 --> 41:58.550
If it violates the laws of God
and gravity, they did it twice.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.139
You write that yourself?

42:01.139 --> 42:03.072
We first took notice in 2011,

42:03.072 --> 42:06.558
Rio, when they robbed
a drug kingpin, Hernan Reyes,

42:06.558 --> 42:08.526
left his body on a bridge.

42:08.526 --> 42:12.115
My predecessor, Mr. Nobody,
saw potential,

42:12.115 --> 42:14.497
so he recruited them--
freelance, of course.

42:14.497 --> 42:16.637
They ran missions for us
in Abu Dhabi,

42:16.637 --> 42:19.433
Tokyo, London,
New York, Tbilisi.

42:19.433 --> 42:21.366
You ask me, we should've
cut ties years back,

42:21.366 --> 42:24.024
but they had their champions.

42:24.024 --> 42:25.473
That's their M.O.

42:25.473 --> 42:27.372
To corrupt law enforcement.

42:27.372 --> 42:28.684
Brian O'Conner.

42:28.684 --> 42:30.582
Elena Neves. Luke Hobbs.

42:30.582 --> 42:32.480
Everyone becomes family.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.413
It's like a cult with cars.

42:34.413 --> 42:37.934
Even Tess's dear old dad.

42:38.728 --> 42:40.005
So we're all just

42:40.005 --> 42:42.594
a barbecue and a beer away
from corruption?

42:42.594 --> 42:43.871
What's your point?

42:43.871 --> 42:45.424
Point is they're criminals.

42:45.424 --> 42:47.185
Rome was a matter of time.

42:47.185 --> 42:48.876
They've stolen
hundreds of millions of dollars

42:48.876 --> 42:52.190
and at least one nuclear sub.

42:52.190 --> 42:55.918
The real question is: How did
we let this go on so long?

42:55.918 --> 42:58.472
This family has gotten their
hands dirty to keep ours clean.

42:58.472 --> 43:02.303
They've driven to the gates of
hell and back for this agency.

43:02.303 --> 43:04.202
Something is not right
with Rome.

43:04.202 --> 43:05.341
It can't be.

43:05.341 --> 43:07.688
It can and it is.

43:07.688 --> 43:09.517
The agency is better than this.

43:09.517 --> 43:10.967
We are smarter than this.

43:10.967 --> 43:12.659
We should be standing with Dom
and his family.

43:12.659 --> 43:14.177
That is the very least
that we can do.

43:14.177 --> 43:15.972
If we don't act,
this blows back on all of us.

43:15.972 --> 43:18.872
The fallout will be existential.

43:20.667 --> 43:22.945
I'm asking for
full green-light authority.

43:22.945 --> 43:25.568
Kill or capture
the Toretto clan by any means.

43:25.568 --> 43:27.570
Aimes, what are you doing?

43:34.301 --> 43:36.303
Looks like the ayes have it.

43:36.303 --> 43:38.098
As your direct superior,

43:38.098 --> 43:40.721
I don't give a shit about
anybody's heart of gold,

43:40.721 --> 43:43.655
and I hate barbecues.

43:43.655 --> 43:46.209
You know I'd make a
freight train take a dirt road,

43:46.209 --> 43:49.350
so do not get in my way.

43:52.284 --> 43:53.872
Okay.

43:57.151 --> 43:58.566
I'll go my own way.

44:00.465 --> 44:04.296
♪ My world has fallen

44:05.504 --> 44:08.300
♪ I'm falling to my knees

44:11.165 --> 44:15.411

44:30.184 --> 44:33.463
Well, it ain't no Roman holiday.

44:33.463 --> 44:36.294
And you're no Gregory Peck.

44:36.294 --> 44:38.227
Mm.

44:38.227 --> 44:39.746
My family?

44:39.746 --> 44:43.508
Your team's gone to ground.
They're safe for now.

44:43.508 --> 44:46.028
They've taken Letty.

44:47.374 --> 44:49.583
- Who's they?
- The agency.

44:49.583 --> 44:51.378
And you've just shot
to number one

44:51.378 --> 44:53.035
on the world's most wanted list.

44:53.035 --> 44:56.521
Whoever did this wanted
to sever your ties to the agency

44:56.521 --> 44:58.419
and isolate you
from your family.

44:58.419 --> 45:01.733
Any attempt to contact your team
will be traced.

45:01.733 --> 45:04.253
I need you to get a message
to Mr. Nobody.

45:04.253 --> 45:06.911
You'll need a medium for that
or a magician.

45:06.911 --> 45:08.947
He's done his disappearing act.

45:08.947 --> 45:11.570
Just get the message out.

45:11.570 --> 45:13.780
Tell him I'm ready
to have that Belgian,

45:13.780 --> 45:15.057
and he'll know where to go.

45:15.057 --> 45:16.748
I've got a message for you, ducky.

45:16.748 --> 45:20.062
The world is on fire,
and you want to keep running

45:20.062 --> 45:22.443
into the burning building
to save lives,

45:22.443 --> 45:25.723
but eventually the building's
gonna collapse on you.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.414
I don't care about dying.

45:28.587 --> 45:32.730
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.526
You know why gladiators
never had families?

45:36.526 --> 45:38.632
- Why?
- Because they knew

45:38.632 --> 45:41.255
that every day
might be their last.

45:41.255 --> 45:45.466
You're choosing a lonely way,
my darling.

45:45.466 --> 45:48.159
Can't take anyone with you.

46:08.869 --> 46:10.733
Bring God's Eye online.

46:10.733 --> 46:12.804
Yes, sir.
Initiating.

46:12.804 --> 46:14.668
Get me Toretto
and the others' locations

46:14.668 --> 46:16.118
to the millimeter.

46:16.118 --> 46:17.809
Sir, we have a problem.

46:17.809 --> 46:19.673
The God's Eye tracking hardware
has been removed.

46:19.673 --> 46:21.364
Tess.

46:21.364 --> 46:23.815
I guess her visit
wasn't purely a social call.

46:23.815 --> 46:25.161
Do me a favor.

46:25.161 --> 46:27.612
She pops up on any grid,
let's see where she goes.

46:27.612 --> 46:31.581
As for the rest, our fugitives
aren't unknown quantities.

46:31.581 --> 46:35.275
Toretto has a sister, a son.

46:35.275 --> 46:37.587
Until we find him,

46:37.587 --> 46:39.279
find his family.

46:58.885 --> 47:01.404
Oh!

47:01.404 --> 47:03.199
- Again.

47:03.199 --> 47:05.339
Wow.

47:05.339 --> 47:06.996
Are you cheating
on-on your favorite auntie?

47:06.996 --> 47:09.792
It doesn't matter if you win
by an inch or a mile.

47:09.792 --> 47:10.931
Winning's winning.

47:10.931 --> 47:12.899
Where have I heard
that one before?

47:15.246 --> 47:17.593
Go! Go!

47:19.077 --> 47:21.355
Search everywhere!
We need them alive!

47:26.395 --> 47:29.260
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

47:31.469 --> 47:33.436
No! Mia! Let her go!

47:38.717 --> 47:40.064
Run!

48:06.711 --> 48:08.713
- What's up?
- Uncle Jakob?

48:08.713 --> 48:09.783
Your dad sent me.

48:11.509 --> 48:12.613
Change of plans.

48:31.425 --> 48:32.840
Don't move!

48:32.840 --> 48:34.981
- I said don't move!

49:15.607 --> 49:17.023
Do you have Little B?

49:17.851 --> 49:19.266
B!

49:20.958 --> 49:23.201
- Freeze!

49:29.483 --> 49:30.553
- You okay?
- Yeah.

49:37.491 --> 49:38.665
Are you okay?

49:42.427 --> 49:44.533
B!

49:44.533 --> 49:46.190
Come, come.

49:49.124 --> 49:51.126
Who the hell were those guys?

49:51.126 --> 49:54.232
Agency. Rome was a trap.
Whole family's being targeted.

49:54.232 --> 49:55.854
Okay, I got to get to Brian
and the kids...

49:55.854 --> 49:57.132
Dom sent me to take him.

49:57.132 --> 49:59.099
Remember that place
we said we'd go

49:59.099 --> 50:00.342
if the world went to hell?

50:00.342 --> 50:02.344
Dom wants the team
to meet there.

50:02.344 --> 50:03.690
Yeah.

50:03.690 --> 50:05.002
Okay, look.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.417
Little B, you're gonna go
with Uncle Jakob.

50:06.417 --> 50:08.729
Okay? You do whatever he says.
Yeah?

50:08.729 --> 50:11.594
I'm gonna get you to your dad.
If that's okay with you.

50:12.354 --> 50:14.701
Protect him with your life.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.945
I love you, Jakey.

50:17.945 --> 50:20.327
I love you, too, sis.

50:20.327 --> 50:22.088
Let's do it.

50:30.406 --> 50:33.720
Oh, my God.

50:36.309 --> 50:37.965
Yo!

50:37.965 --> 50:39.795
It's not that one.

50:39.795 --> 50:41.693
It's this one.

50:42.660 --> 50:44.489
Yep.

50:46.526 --> 50:47.699

52:03.465 --> 52:04.811
Cheers.

52:07.503 --> 52:10.610
Queenie told me
I could find you here.

52:10.610 --> 52:11.956
Belgian?

52:11.956 --> 52:14.165
Mr. Nobody said
he had a daughter.

52:14.165 --> 52:16.236
He did?

52:16.236 --> 52:20.137
Well, now that
he's gone missing,

52:20.137 --> 52:21.931
I came in from the cold.

52:21.931 --> 52:23.795
Your dad kept the agency
in line.

52:23.795 --> 52:27.247
Now it feels like
all the anchors have been cut.

52:27.247 --> 52:31.631
In a world where there is
no code, no one's safe.

52:31.631 --> 52:33.564
You're right.

52:33.564 --> 52:36.843
The agency has turned its back
on everything it stood for.

52:36.843 --> 52:40.295
The new boss, Aimes, he's coming
for you with everything.

52:41.365 --> 52:43.298
I'm buying you some time.

52:43.298 --> 52:48.475
And borrowed their, uh,
little tracking device thingy.

52:49.718 --> 52:51.029
Look familiar?

52:51.029 --> 52:52.410
God's Eye.
- Mm-hmm.

52:52.410 --> 52:54.101
I'd put that
in a vault somewhere.

52:54.101 --> 52:57.657
People pull vaults out of walls,
so I think it's safer with me.

52:57.657 --> 52:59.245
I pulled a screen grab

52:59.245 --> 53:01.074
off of a traffic cam
that they missed,

53:01.074 --> 53:02.765
put it in God's Eye.

53:02.765 --> 53:04.422
There was a hit in Rio.

53:04.422 --> 53:07.218
You wouldn't happen to have
any enemies in Rio, would you?

53:07.218 --> 53:09.565
- Reyes.
- Hernan Reyes?

53:09.565 --> 53:14.467
Still pretty dead,
but he has a son, Dante.

53:16.331 --> 53:18.298
So you're gonna
have to get me to Rio.

53:18.298 --> 53:21.646
That's your second wish.
You have one more.

53:22.613 --> 53:23.924
Letty.

53:26.927 --> 53:30.034
Letty's in a black site prison
off of every map.

53:30.034 --> 53:31.242
Then get her out.

53:31.242 --> 53:32.899
Nobody can.

53:32.899 --> 53:34.763
Nobody would.

53:34.763 --> 53:36.247
Dom, I'm so sorry,

53:36.247 --> 53:39.630
but what you're asking me to do
is impossible.

53:47.293 --> 53:49.536
Nothing's impossible.

53:53.057 --> 53:54.886
You just have to have faith.

54:05.725 --> 54:09.280
Sneaking us out of Rome
in a shipping container

54:09.280 --> 54:11.558
full of aftershave,
that was a terrible idea, Roman.

54:11.558 --> 54:14.561
Wait, I think
I lost my sense of smell.

54:14.561 --> 54:16.563
That is not aftershave.
That is tear gas.

54:16.563 --> 54:19.325
Hey, man, I don't know
what y'all are talking about.

54:19.325 --> 54:21.292
You know what I mean?

54:21.292 --> 54:22.845
I smell magic.

54:22.845 --> 54:24.226
I took a bottle for myself.

54:24.226 --> 54:25.917
This is all thanks to you.

54:25.917 --> 54:27.471
You know that, right?

54:27.471 --> 54:29.956
No, see, you just got to follow
my "leat" as a "leater."

54:29.956 --> 54:33.787
You see what I'm saying?
I'm a natural-born "leater."

54:33.787 --> 54:35.548
Where are we?

54:35.548 --> 54:37.515
I brought you back home, Ramsey.

54:37.515 --> 54:40.207
The city with the most
amount of surveillance cameras.

54:40.207 --> 54:41.588
Perfect.

54:51.426 --> 54:54.429
- Dad know you drive this thing?
- He should.

54:54.429 --> 54:55.706
I raced him in it.

54:55.706 --> 54:58.502
And just so you know,
in the '90s,

54:58.502 --> 55:01.332
if you were rolling in a 5.0,
it meant you were the man.

55:01.332 --> 55:04.024
Like it or not,
it's still a 'Stang.

55:04.024 --> 55:06.751
So, you know, respect.

58:51.044 --> 58:52.598

58:56.325 --> 58:57.534
You already did.

A GOAT.

59:37.470 --> 59:40.369
We're all looking for
a little validation.

59:40.369 --> 59:41.819
- You racing or what?

59:41.819 --> 59:43.131
Trust me,
you don't want that smoke.

59:43.131 --> 59:44.339
I'm not here
for pink slips tonight.

59:49.171 --> 59:50.897
- You and everyone here.

01:00:00.286 --> 01:00:02.495
Yeah!

01:00:08.812 --> 01:00:11.504

01:00:11.504 --> 01:00:13.126
Diogo, here.

01:00:13.126 --> 01:00:14.300

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.922
Isabel.

01:00:18.511 --> 01:00:20.271
There will be
a race tonight, yes?

01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:21.652
Yeah, maybe.

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:22.929
- Pretty please, with me on top.

01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:27.589
Dominic Toretto.

01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:29.867
I knew you would come for me.

01:00:29.867 --> 01:00:33.112
I'm sorry we didn't
get to meet in Roma.

01:00:33.112 --> 01:00:35.321
We were both so busy.

01:00:35.321 --> 01:00:37.426
I'm Dante. <i>Enchanté.</i>

01:00:38.255 --> 01:00:43.501
And you were
<i>fantástico, fabuloso, o cara.</i>

01:00:43.501 --> 01:00:45.434
He saved the Vatican.

01:00:45.434 --> 01:00:46.643
Who does that?

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:49.922
Seriously. The Pope? God?

01:00:49.922 --> 01:00:51.786
By the way,
did you see what I did there?

01:00:51.786 --> 01:00:53.684
The ball through the city was

01:00:53.684 --> 01:00:56.376
a bit of an homage
to my family's safe.

01:00:56.376 --> 01:00:58.378
Except it was on fire.

01:01:01.347 --> 01:01:03.590
You remember my father?

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:06.179
- Hernan Reyes.
- Yes.

01:01:06.179 --> 01:01:09.527
I remember he thought he had
his foot on this city's neck.

01:01:09.527 --> 01:01:11.081
But you know what happened?

01:01:11.081 --> 01:01:13.186
I took him down.

01:01:13.186 --> 01:01:16.707
Let's not argue
in front of the children.

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:18.433
You are absolutely right.

01:01:18.433 --> 01:01:21.091
My father was a horrible man,

01:01:21.091 --> 01:01:23.576
very bad daddy,

01:01:23.576 --> 01:01:25.371
but I kind of liked him.

01:01:25.371 --> 01:01:28.098
And you took him from me
when you stole our money

01:01:28.098 --> 01:01:30.652
and left us
with nothing but suffering.

01:01:30.652 --> 01:01:33.655
Well, that's what
I came here for.

01:01:33.655 --> 01:01:36.313
To end that suffering.

01:01:37.659 --> 01:01:39.488
Oh, and I didn't take
that money.

01:01:42.353 --> 01:01:44.045
I burned it.

01:01:44.804 --> 01:01:46.633
Uh-oh.

01:01:46.633 --> 01:01:49.602
Well, Brazil is mine,

01:01:49.602 --> 01:01:51.190
and I own this city.

01:01:52.605 --> 01:01:54.331
Ooh.

01:01:58.369 --> 01:02:00.889
You people think
you can buy everything.

01:02:02.891 --> 01:02:04.790
But you can't buy the streets.

01:02:09.967 --> 01:02:11.762
We stand with Dom.

01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:17.319
Well, this is awkward.

01:02:17.319 --> 01:02:20.598
So, how about we all just
start shooting each other

01:02:20.598 --> 01:02:21.599
and see what happens?

01:02:21.599 --> 01:02:24.568
Or we race.

01:02:24.568 --> 01:02:26.501
If you win, you take me in.

01:02:26.501 --> 01:02:27.951

01:02:29.676 --> 01:02:31.782
Don't lose.

01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:35.234

you wanted to see a race.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.846
You're just so impressive.

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:37.779
You've won so many races.

01:03:37.779 --> 01:03:39.229
Everyone loves you.

01:03:40.195 --> 01:03:42.853
You've saved so many lives.

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:44.682
I know.

01:03:44.682 --> 01:03:47.064
It's like you're a...

01:03:47.064 --> 01:03:49.170

01:03:52.794 --> 01:03:55.003
And I've been studying you.

01:03:55.935 --> 01:03:57.419
And watching you.

01:03:58.627 --> 01:04:01.078
I can't figure it out.

01:04:01.078 --> 01:04:02.252
How...

01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:06.083
How do you choose?

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:10.329
How do you choose
the ones you save?

Do not touch that. Let it dry.

01:08:26.826 --> 01:08:29.174
You guys look fantastic.

01:08:29.174 --> 01:08:32.694
I know the black is
very slimming and very scary,

01:08:32.694 --> 01:08:34.558
but the pastels, you know,
they're in season,

01:08:34.558 --> 01:08:37.527
and I feel like it tones down
the masculinity a little bit,

01:08:37.527 --> 01:08:39.667
which we all need these days.

01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:42.083
Did you know...

01:08:42.083 --> 01:08:43.671
Listen to me.

01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:46.156
Did you know that I was
legally dead for two minutes?

01:08:46.156 --> 01:08:47.502
Two minutes.

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:49.780
- Bob, pay attention.

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:51.851
And you know what I saw?

01:08:51.851 --> 01:08:53.094
Nothing.

01:08:53.094 --> 01:08:55.407
Not a goddamn thing.

01:08:55.407 --> 01:08:59.652
But I do feel like
once he, uh...

01:08:59.652 --> 01:09:02.483
cracked my skull open,
it just opened my mind.

01:09:03.415 --> 01:09:05.451
Yeah, that's deep, right?

01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:07.798
- You're absolutely right, Bob.

01:09:07.798 --> 01:09:08.903
We should get back to work.

01:09:10.801 --> 01:09:12.182
Such a stickler.

01:09:13.252 --> 01:09:15.565
All right. [sighs] Let's see.

01:09:15.565 --> 01:09:17.049
Should we take all their money?

01:09:18.878 --> 01:09:21.433
You. You are evil.

01:09:21.433 --> 01:09:23.262
- Thank you for listening.

01:09:23.262 --> 01:09:25.057
So, <i>mi casa, su casa.</i>

01:09:25.057 --> 01:09:27.232

finish those mojitos,

01:09:27.232 --> 01:09:29.717
and, um, someone's gonna come
and bury you guys soon.

01:09:29.717 --> 01:09:31.719

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:06.685
All right.

01:10:08.963 --> 01:10:09.929
Whoa.

01:10:09.929 --> 01:10:12.138
Cool. What is that?

01:10:12.138 --> 01:10:13.485
That's a technical tool kit.

01:10:13.485 --> 01:10:15.280
Don't worry, it's just
a bunch of awesome stuff

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.178
that you're never
gonna get to use.

01:10:17.178 --> 01:10:19.732
- Okay.

01:10:19.732 --> 01:10:21.907
Eyes open. Hold still.

01:10:21.907 --> 01:10:23.288
Don't smile like that.

01:10:23.288 --> 01:10:25.117
- It's unsettling.

01:10:25.117 --> 01:10:27.395
Sweet.
Your new name is Chester...

01:10:27.395 --> 01:10:30.122
Chester? -...and you're

- your handsome,

ripped Uncle Roger.

01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:35.023
All right.

01:10:35.023 --> 01:10:37.267
Now, time to get you
some new clothes.

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.993
You know, something
a little more chic than

01:10:38.993 --> 01:10:41.237
pj pants, all right?

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:44.067
- From a gas station?
- From a gas station.

<i>See, I just don't understand.</i>

01:10:50.349 --> 01:10:53.249
Why would the agency
turn they backs on us,

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:55.216
after all we've done for them?

01:10:55.216 --> 01:10:56.666
That madman pinned it all on us,

01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:58.357
and now we're
public enemy number one.

01:10:58.357 --> 01:11:01.947
Well, Dom is gonna meet us
at the rendezvous point.

01:11:01.947 --> 01:11:03.742
But in the meantime,
we have to stay under the radar.

01:11:03.742 --> 01:11:05.330
And we got to get ready
to fight.

01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:08.540
Wait, so we need guns,
artillery, tanks?

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.267
Yeah, but how are we gonna
get that with no money?

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:12.751
What?

01:11:12.751 --> 01:11:14.131
- We've been hacked.

01:11:14.131 --> 01:11:15.719
Look. Every account.

01:11:15.719 --> 01:11:20.103
Every dollar we made
over the last 20 years is gone.

01:11:20.103 --> 01:11:21.346
He took everything.

01:11:21.346 --> 01:11:22.864
We got heisted
during our own heist.

01:11:22.864 --> 01:11:24.556
- Just decrypt the... Yeah.
- Decrypt the blockchain.

01:11:24.556 --> 01:11:26.523
I'm on it. Then we can find
the transaction hash.

01:11:26.523 --> 01:11:27.766
The transaction hash.

01:11:27.766 --> 01:11:28.767
Gets us the receiving IPs. Exactly.

01:11:28.767 --> 01:11:29.871
English.

01:11:29.871 --> 01:11:31.148
Following our money, genius.

01:11:31.148 --> 01:11:32.357
We're trying to see
where he sent it.

01:11:32.357 --> 01:11:33.634
The coding is next-level.

01:11:33.634 --> 01:11:35.912
I've never seen
anything like this.

01:11:35.912 --> 01:11:38.294
We need more computing power.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.019
How are we gonna do that
if we broke?

01:11:40.019 --> 01:11:42.574
What do you mean, "we" broke?

01:11:45.024 --> 01:11:47.337
Wait, you holding out on us?

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:48.856
No wonder you've been so calm.

01:11:48.856 --> 01:11:51.962
Bro, what-what d--
what do you think this is, bro?

01:11:51.962 --> 01:11:54.068
You know what? Turn around.

01:11:54.068 --> 01:11:55.172
"Turn around"? What do you...

01:11:55.172 --> 01:11:56.484
What you mean, "turn around"?

01:11:56.484 --> 01:11:58.590
Man, I'm a grown-ass...

01:11:59.763 --> 01:12:02.559
- What-- N-- What are you doing?
Hey, Roman, do not.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:07.150
Please tell me
you're not wearing Spanx.

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:09.359
Oh, this ain't Spanx.
These banks.

01:12:09.359 --> 01:12:11.361
But it's okay, bro. I got you.

01:12:11.361 --> 01:12:12.673
All right?

01:12:12.673 --> 01:12:15.365
You know what I mean?

01:12:18.403 --> 01:12:19.990
Yeah. That's for you.

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:21.958
That's for you.

01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:23.200
Let me see.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.617
Han, you always good
for the bag,

01:12:25.617 --> 01:12:28.758
'cause the bag
always come back, you know.

01:12:28.758 --> 01:12:32.693
So what I need from
all of y'all, I need receipts.

01:12:32.693 --> 01:12:35.627
Who is you talking to?
Got your receipt.

01:12:36.248 --> 01:12:39.769
So where do we go
to shop off the grid?

01:12:41.011 --> 01:12:42.392
I know a place.

01:12:58.304 --> 01:13:01.584
Wait. The agency's after us.
Aren't they gonna see our faces?

01:13:01.584 --> 01:13:03.206
Yeah, I'm counting on it.

01:13:03.206 --> 01:13:04.621
The first rule of tradecraft:

01:13:04.621 --> 01:13:06.554
you can't lose a tail
if they don't find you.

01:13:06.554 --> 01:13:07.935
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

01:13:07.935 --> 01:13:09.419
I'll just-- Wait.
You know what, I'm just...

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:10.524
We'll just--
If you want to, uh, go.

01:13:10.524 --> 01:13:12.008
Uh, we'll stay here.

01:13:12.008 --> 01:13:13.389
- You guys, you guys go around.
- Go around? Great.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.149
Go around.

01:13:19.912 --> 01:13:21.914
<i>Sir, we just got a hit
on the boy and his uncle.</i>

01:13:21.914 --> 01:13:23.571
The rest of the team
is still in Europe.

01:13:23.571 --> 01:13:24.745
We're interfacing
with local authorities.

01:13:24.745 --> 01:13:26.332
Forget authorities.

01:13:26.332 --> 01:13:27.610
These people have been
outrunning the cops

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:28.887
since they could
reach the gas pedal.

01:13:28.887 --> 01:13:30.751
Get word to
every snitch, smuggler,

01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:32.131
hitter and hacker
we've ever used.

01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:34.720
Money talks and so will they.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.308
- We're getting an alert

01:13:36.308 --> 01:13:37.309
on Black Site A.

01:13:37.309 --> 01:13:39.622
Tess just visited Ortiz.

01:13:39.622 --> 01:13:41.209
They have a nice chat?

01:13:42.176 --> 01:13:43.971
Guess not.

01:13:43.971 --> 01:13:46.663
Run it back for me.

01:13:48.941 --> 01:13:50.771
Stop. Zoom in.

01:13:52.497 --> 01:13:54.326
Back-trace her flight path.

01:13:54.326 --> 01:13:55.983
Find out where she was
before this.

01:13:55.983 --> 01:13:57.778
That's where Dom is.

01:14:12.862 --> 01:14:15.485
You knew who I was
all along, didn't you?

01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:17.314
From the moment I saw you.

01:14:17.314 --> 01:14:22.078
Your sister smiled with her eyes
and led with her heart.

01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:26.116
Just like you do.

01:14:27.393 --> 01:14:29.050
We were nothing alike.

01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:31.570
She was the good sister.

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.572
Always putting others first.

01:14:33.572 --> 01:14:35.954
Always doing what was right.

01:14:38.784 --> 01:14:41.925
Sometimes I would think
that the wrong sister died.

01:14:43.202 --> 01:14:45.273
Why the good one and not me?

01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:59.322
You're wrong about
not being anything like her.

01:14:59.322 --> 01:15:02.187
You think
that's what she wants to hear?

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.088
A cop and a street racer.

01:15:07.088 --> 01:15:08.952
I'll tell you something.

01:15:08.952 --> 01:15:12.093
They travel down the same road
long enough...

01:15:13.854 --> 01:15:17.547
...and they realize
how much alike they really are.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.586
Trust me...

01:15:22.587 --> 01:15:25.175
...I know.

01:15:33.598 --> 01:15:36.186
She's still doing it, isn't she?

01:15:39.914 --> 01:15:42.227
She's still helping people.

01:15:46.265 --> 01:15:48.233
She's helping us.

01:15:49.475 --> 01:15:51.823
You know, Elena,

01:15:51.823 --> 01:15:54.273
she knew everything
about the Reyes family.

01:15:54.273 --> 01:15:55.930
After they killed her husband,

01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:58.726
she dedicated her life
trying to take them down.

01:15:58.726 --> 01:16:02.178
I think I still have her files.

01:16:03.179 --> 01:16:06.113
<i>Wait, so we gonna find
military-grade gear</i>

01:16:06.113 --> 01:16:07.597
<i>in the middle of London?</i>

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:09.219
You said you wanted
to shop off the grid.

01:16:12.913 --> 01:16:16.088
Wait a second.
Did we just time-travel?

01:16:16.088 --> 01:16:18.470
Would you look for
a black-market operation

01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:20.092
in a place like this?

01:16:21.853 --> 01:16:23.130
You've got mail.

01:16:23.130 --> 01:16:25.235
- Ooh, snacks.
- Get me a receipt, homey.

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:29.515
How am I gonna get a receipt
from a vending machine?

01:16:29.515 --> 01:16:30.896
How about you figure it out?

01:16:30.896 --> 01:16:33.589
Paper trail, bruh.
For tax write-off.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:35.004
I swear to God...

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.110
What's up, Bowie420?

01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:40.665
Oh, shit. FreddieMerc?

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:44.461
What? I had a life
before you knew me.

01:16:45.773 --> 01:16:47.361
Bowie here runs
one of the most notorious

01:16:47.361 --> 01:16:48.983
online black markets.

01:16:48.983 --> 01:16:50.985
If you want it, he'll sell it.

01:16:50.985 --> 01:16:52.573
I thought you didn't like that
about me, though.

01:16:52.573 --> 01:16:53.988
Well, desperate times.

01:16:53.988 --> 01:16:55.541
What kind of muffins are these?

01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:56.681
Oh, those are fun muffins.

01:16:56.681 --> 01:16:58.199
You have like four of them,

01:16:58.199 --> 01:16:59.856
you'll be in your underwear
watching <i>Fantasia.</i>

01:16:59.856 --> 01:17:01.099
Is that what you guys came for?
My muffins?

01:17:01.099 --> 01:17:02.756
Oh, it's gonna be
a muffin party?

01:17:04.033 --> 01:17:06.276
We, uh, we need transport.

01:17:06.276 --> 01:17:08.451
Weapons, cars, the works.

01:17:08.451 --> 01:17:09.866
And quietly.

01:17:09.866 --> 01:17:11.592
Cool, then I'm just
gonna need cash. Okay?

01:17:11.592 --> 01:17:12.938
None of that crypto stuff.

01:17:12.938 --> 01:17:15.044
Oh, the Black Jeff Bezos here
got you covered.

01:17:15.044 --> 01:17:17.736
Black Bezos? -Yeah, he's even
been into outer space.

01:17:17.736 --> 01:17:19.876
Wow. -If y'all was gonna be
giving out my money,

01:17:19.876 --> 01:17:21.878
I'd appreciate
some type of a heads-up,

01:17:21.878 --> 01:17:23.328
you know what I'm saying?

01:17:23.328 --> 01:17:25.364
How much we talking about, bruh?

01:17:25.364 --> 01:17:26.918
Just like a reasonable amount.

01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:29.403
How about that?

01:17:30.922 --> 01:17:32.440
That won't even cover
the muffins.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.683
Is this guy serious?

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:35.685
Shit's crazy. Mm-kay.

01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:37.860
Come on, man,
you're an astronaut.

01:17:39.102 --> 01:17:41.208
Well, how about that?

01:17:41.208 --> 01:17:42.796
What, did you leave
all your money in space?

01:17:42.796 --> 01:17:44.694
Man, give me this.

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.351
- Thank you.
- Are you serious right now?

01:17:46.351 --> 01:17:48.733
You know I pay for everything
around here, right?

01:17:48.733 --> 01:17:50.562
You should pay for everything.

01:17:50.562 --> 01:17:53.807
It's your mission in Rome that
got us here in the first place.

01:17:53.807 --> 01:17:56.223
No, it was your intel
that led us to Rome.

01:17:56.223 --> 01:17:58.432
To be fair, that setup would
have confused the best of us.

01:17:58.432 --> 01:17:59.675
No, I'm tired of this.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.090
'Cause all he do is talk.

01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:03.471
And then everyone
has to do their job and yours.

01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:04.818
What are you saying, Tej?

01:18:04.818 --> 01:18:06.371
- Mean, what I'm saying?
Hey, guys.

01:18:06.371 --> 01:18:08.580
- This is a family environment.
- What? Really?

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.478
- Really?
Take it outside, fellas.

01:18:10.478 --> 01:18:13.171
So, what we doing, bruh?

01:18:13.171 --> 01:18:14.413
Uh-oh.

01:18:14.413 --> 01:18:17.106
- Gentlemen, please! Guys!

01:18:18.348 --> 01:18:20.419
Oh, not the vending machine.
No. -WOMAN: Unbelievable.

01:18:20.419 --> 01:18:23.526
Guys, you're causing like
dozens of dollars in damage!

01:18:23.526 --> 01:18:25.355
Let's go. Come on.

01:18:25.355 --> 01:18:27.392
Should we stop this?

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:31.845
Hold on!
- Nah, let 'em bond.

01:18:32.673 --> 01:18:35.124
Hey!
That computer's from, like, '98!

01:18:36.194 --> 01:18:37.885
Huh?

01:18:38.817 --> 01:18:41.820
BOWIE [echoing]:
What the hell, man?

01:18:52.382 --> 01:18:54.453
Okay. All right.

01:18:54.453 --> 01:18:55.765
We doing stomachs now.

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:57.318
All right, all right,
that's enough.

01:18:57.318 --> 01:18:58.975
You've been wanting that
for years! -BOWIE: Uh, I think

01:18:58.975 --> 01:19:01.150
he hit the copy machine so hard
it works now.

01:19:05.499 --> 01:19:06.914
What the hell was that?

01:19:06.914 --> 01:19:08.053
He's like a ghetto magician.

01:19:08.053 --> 01:19:10.090
You know what it is, bruh.

01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:12.333
- I beat your ass.
- You just beat my ass?

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:13.610
- Beat my ass, huh?
- My God,

01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:14.888
will you two just quit it?
Please.

01:19:14.888 --> 01:19:16.855
We don't have time for this. You.

01:19:16.855 --> 01:19:18.443
- Get to work.
- Oh, I just need

01:19:18.443 --> 01:19:20.479
to hack into the marketplace.
It'll just take a second.

01:19:20.479 --> 01:19:22.688
Oops.

01:19:22.688 --> 01:19:24.518
What the hell, Bowie?
What did you just do?

01:19:24.518 --> 01:19:25.830
I'm sorry.
Your guys's faces are,

01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:27.590
like, all over the dark web.

01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:29.247
I mean, that reward is dope.

01:19:29.247 --> 01:19:31.076
-  Ow. Hey.
- We have to move.

01:19:31.076 --> 01:19:33.665
- The agency's minutes away.
- Look, it's nothing personal.

01:19:33.665 --> 01:19:35.909
- Hey, fun muffins on me, okay?
- What? Huh?

01:19:35.909 --> 01:19:36.979
- Oh!
Oh!

01:19:36.979 --> 01:19:39.188
I deserved that.

01:19:39.188 --> 01:19:41.811
- Are you okay, bro?
- Yeah, thank you, man.

01:19:47.127 --> 01:19:48.818
All right, so where to now, huh?

01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:50.095
- Jail?

01:19:50.095 --> 01:19:53.443
I know somewhere.
Last place I want to go.

01:20:18.986 --> 01:20:21.782
How does it feel to be
on my side of the law?

01:20:21.782 --> 01:20:24.647
They like to fix things
before they break 'em.

01:20:24.647 --> 01:20:27.339
It's a sick place, Letty.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.172
You're welcome.

01:20:32.172 --> 01:20:33.518
What did you do?

01:20:33.518 --> 01:20:36.624
I rerouted anesthetic gas
into their air conditioning.

01:20:36.624 --> 01:20:40.111
And I bought us a few minutes
before these cameras reset

01:20:40.111 --> 01:20:43.045
and they find out this place
turned into a sleep study.

01:20:47.256 --> 01:20:50.431
You gonna stay grumpy or
do you want to get out of here?

01:20:51.501 --> 01:20:53.952
They're not gonna sleep forever.

01:20:53.952 --> 01:20:56.852
Don't you want to get back
to your precious family?

01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.993
Shit.

01:21:02.754 --> 01:21:04.721
Seems like you got this covered.

01:21:04.721 --> 01:21:06.516
- What do you need me for?
- I have a plan,

01:21:06.516 --> 01:21:09.105
but it's a two-person job.

01:21:17.942 --> 01:21:19.598
Now, was that so hard?

01:21:20.496 --> 01:21:22.601
How much time do we have?

01:21:22.601 --> 01:21:24.707
I'd say about four minutes.

01:21:24.707 --> 01:21:25.881
It'll have to do.

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:27.572

Dante Reyes.

01:23:17.164 --> 01:23:19.028
Born in Portugal.

01:23:19.028 --> 01:23:21.997
Mother from the Pacific Islands.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:25.000
Sociopathic tendencies
from an early age.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.141
He bounced from juvie to prison
to mental wards.

01:23:28.141 --> 01:23:30.522
And each time, Daddy was there
to spring him out.

01:23:30.522 --> 01:23:34.250
After his father died,
he disappeared.

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:38.875
Properties Reyes owned
before he died.

01:23:38.875 --> 01:23:41.499
Now all sold and repo'd.

01:23:41.499 --> 01:23:43.156
Except this one.

01:23:44.674 --> 01:23:46.849
The police station.

01:23:46.849 --> 01:23:49.093
It's been abandoned for years.

01:23:49.093 --> 01:23:51.474
And guess whose name
is on the deed.

01:23:52.924 --> 01:23:54.546
Dante Reyes.

01:23:55.616 --> 01:23:57.032
I'll find my answer there.

01:23:58.757 --> 01:24:01.691
I'm coming with you.

01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:07.214
I need you to stay safe.

01:24:12.461 --> 01:24:15.222
I would have won that race,
you know.

01:24:16.016 --> 01:24:17.397
So you want a rematch?

01:24:17.397 --> 01:24:19.916
- I'm demanding it.

01:24:19.916 --> 01:24:22.643
So I guess I'll see you soon.

01:24:54.192 --> 01:24:56.815
Guys, you don't want to do this.

01:24:56.815 --> 01:24:59.024
He needs a new watch, cop.

01:24:59.024 --> 01:25:00.543
Look, the watch was a gift.

01:25:00.543 --> 01:25:03.098
But I got 16 carats of
uncut diamonds in my jockstrap

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:04.823
if you want to take a look.

01:25:14.902 --> 01:25:17.802
Now you really do need
a new watch.

01:25:23.048 --> 01:25:24.705
Damn it.

01:25:34.543 --> 01:25:35.682
B, you okay?

01:25:37.684 --> 01:25:39.168
Tried gum? Gum helps.

01:25:39.168 --> 01:25:41.515
I don't like planes.

01:25:41.515 --> 01:25:44.415
If it's the height,
that's gonna be an issue.

01:25:45.381 --> 01:25:47.866
You know, I used to be
scared of cars.

01:25:48.764 --> 01:25:52.630
After my dad died,
I guess I blamed myself.

01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:53.665
It was tough.

01:25:53.665 --> 01:25:56.185
I had panic attacks,
the whole bit.

01:25:56.185 --> 01:25:57.704
Heck, I took the bus.

01:25:57.704 --> 01:26:00.603
Yeah. I think I was just
so worried about making mistakes

01:26:00.603 --> 01:26:03.813
and not being
as good as my brother.

01:26:03.813 --> 01:26:05.263
- You?
- Uh, excuse me.

01:26:05.263 --> 01:26:07.092
Have you met your dad?

01:26:07.092 --> 01:26:09.094
He casts a pretty big shadow.

01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:14.686
Huh. Feeling better?

01:26:14.686 --> 01:26:15.825
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:26:15.825 --> 01:26:17.655
Me, too.

01:26:21.693 --> 01:26:25.387
Here's the drink
that you ordered, sir.

01:26:27.872 --> 01:26:29.701
You know her?

01:26:29.701 --> 01:26:32.842
Yeah, it's good to have friends
in high places.

01:26:32.842 --> 01:26:34.568
On the count of three,

01:26:34.568 --> 01:26:37.192
we're gonna get up
and go to the bathroom. Ready?

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:39.504
- Three.

01:27:14.332 --> 01:27:15.747
Who were those guys?

01:27:15.747 --> 01:27:18.474
Agency. They found us.
Now let's lose our tail.

01:27:26.827 --> 01:27:28.691
Holy shi...

01:27:28.691 --> 01:27:33.144
Wait! Swearing is for song
lyrics only and stubbed toes.

01:27:33.144 --> 01:27:34.559
Forget about it. Pay attention.

01:27:34.559 --> 01:27:36.975
Okay?
We're-we're too high to glide,

01:27:36.975 --> 01:27:40.185
so we need thrust,
which means, uh,

01:27:40.185 --> 01:27:42.464
combustion, which means...?

01:27:43.637 --> 01:27:47.262
Oxygen and fuel.

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:48.332
Alcohol.

01:27:48.332 --> 01:27:49.747
- Um...
- Huh?

01:27:49.747 --> 01:27:50.989
Oh.

01:27:58.238 --> 01:27:59.653
That's rosé. Not gonna work.

01:27:59.653 --> 01:28:01.483
Long story.
But good initiative.

01:28:12.252 --> 01:28:14.219
I'm glad it wasn't the height.

01:28:14.219 --> 01:28:15.876
Enjoy the ride, Little B.

01:28:28.406 --> 01:28:30.097
Bowie tagged us.

01:28:30.097 --> 01:28:31.375
The agency is on our tail.

01:28:31.375 --> 01:28:32.755
We need to find gear

01:28:32.755 --> 01:28:34.930
and get to the rendezvous
as soon as possible.

01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:36.207
It's right here.

01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:39.452
You guys hold back.
Let me take care of this.

01:28:39.452 --> 01:28:41.661
No, no, no.
Th-That's a bad idea.

01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:44.353
- I mean like Roman-level bad.
- What?

01:28:44.353 --> 01:28:45.423
What are you talking about, man?

01:28:45.423 --> 01:28:46.873
You heard what I said.

01:28:46.873 --> 01:28:49.047
Look, bro, you don't
have to do this, man.

01:28:49.047 --> 01:28:50.704
You know I got your back.

01:28:50.704 --> 01:28:51.809
We got your back.

01:28:55.019 --> 01:28:57.435
- I got to do this alone.

01:29:16.212 --> 01:29:18.560
I have something
to talk to you about.

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:22.115
The only reason a dead guy
shows up at my door:

01:29:22.115 --> 01:29:23.392
revenge.

01:29:28.017 --> 01:29:29.122
Oh, shi...

01:29:32.401 --> 01:29:34.817
- Oh, shit.
- Shit. Han!

01:29:36.129 --> 01:29:38.269
Should have stayed dead.

01:29:38.269 --> 01:29:40.098
I can get in. I can get in.

01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:42.549
I don't like repeating myself.

01:29:42.549 --> 01:29:44.965
You ruined my snacks.

01:29:48.417 --> 01:29:51.696
Relax.
I don't want to fight you.

01:29:51.696 --> 01:29:53.802
Then this is gonna end quick.

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.427
You bring more men to kill me?

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:34.394
They're trying to kill me, too.

01:30:35.084 --> 01:30:37.535
Well, it looks like
we got more company.

01:30:37.535 --> 01:30:40.193
- You still drive?
- What do you think?

01:30:43.403 --> 01:30:45.578
Okay, just give me a second.

01:30:45.578 --> 01:30:46.889
Freeze!

01:31:10.154 --> 01:31:12.018
- Drop the laptop!
- Okay.

01:31:38.182 --> 01:31:39.563
- Guys, I'm in.

01:31:51.333 --> 01:31:52.748
No, no, no, no!

01:31:57.063 --> 01:31:58.478
Now we're even.

01:32:05.278 --> 01:32:06.313
You okay?

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:24.608
Now, see, I understand all this.

01:32:24.608 --> 01:32:26.057
What the hell was that?

01:32:31.235 --> 01:32:32.995
You got scared. I saw that.

01:32:32.995 --> 01:32:36.033
- Ain't nobody got scared, bruh.
- No, you were... he was scared.

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.774
LETTY [over speakers]:
We have an unwanted guest.

01:32:52.774 --> 01:32:53.947
DOM [over speakers]:
My family?

01:32:53.947 --> 01:32:55.604
They're safe for now.

01:32:55.604 --> 01:32:56.709
You're not afraid of anything.

01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:58.296
I don't care about dying.

01:32:58.296 --> 01:33:01.403
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

01:33:01.403 --> 01:33:02.577
Hold us in your heart

01:33:02.577 --> 01:33:04.164
and you will never
lose your way.

01:33:04.164 --> 01:33:05.580
You're not afraid of anything.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.167
Fear can be a great teacher.

01:33:07.167 --> 01:33:08.721
LITTLE BRIAN [distorted]:
You're not afraid of anything.

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.875
DANTE [over phone]:
How do you like my place?

01:33:24.875 --> 01:33:28.257
I'm bummed I'm not there
to show you around.

01:33:28.257 --> 01:33:30.639
And a little embarrassed
you saw my vision board.

01:33:32.123 --> 01:33:34.091
But at least you know
how hard I've been working

01:33:34.091 --> 01:33:35.437
to get us to this point.

01:33:35.437 --> 01:33:37.197
Now I know you're a dead man.

01:33:37.197 --> 01:33:38.509
You mean resurrected.

01:33:38.509 --> 01:33:40.166
Thanks to you.

01:33:40.166 --> 01:33:41.892
You know, if you never would
have gotten behind that wheel,

01:33:41.892 --> 01:33:44.757
I'd never be the man
that I am today.

01:33:44.757 --> 01:33:46.793
You built such a beautiful life,

01:33:46.793 --> 01:33:49.831
filled with love and family.

01:33:49.831 --> 01:33:51.591
I never got that chance.

01:33:51.591 --> 01:33:55.560
Collateral damage, chaos, death.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.045
This is your legacy.

01:33:57.045 --> 01:33:58.391
I'm your legacy.

01:33:58.391 --> 01:34:00.151
You know what
I can't figure out?

01:34:00.151 --> 01:34:04.086
How someone born so rich

01:34:04.086 --> 01:34:07.676
chooses the poorest path
through life.

01:34:07.676 --> 01:34:09.505
You got no honor.

01:34:09.505 --> 01:34:13.199
Without honor,
you got no family.

01:34:14.476 --> 01:34:16.236
And without family...

01:34:18.411 --> 01:34:20.447
...you've got nothing.

01:34:20.447 --> 01:34:22.415
I have nothing because of you.

01:34:22.415 --> 01:34:24.866
My future. My family.

01:34:24.866 --> 01:34:27.558
You stole that from me.

01:34:27.558 --> 01:34:30.319
And now I'm gonna break yours,

01:34:30.319 --> 01:34:32.908
piece by piece.

01:34:32.908 --> 01:34:35.393
Stop talking and face me.

01:34:35.393 --> 01:34:36.843
Do you like surprises, Dommy?

01:34:36.843 --> 01:34:39.674
I adore them.

01:34:41.365 --> 01:34:42.884
But the game's not over yet.

01:34:42.884 --> 01:34:45.196
There's still
so many people to hurt.

01:34:47.923 --> 01:34:49.856
I'm coming for you.

01:34:49.856 --> 01:34:52.203
Well, that's gonna be
hard to do in handcuffs.

01:34:52.203 --> 01:34:54.378
Okay, bye, Dommy.

01:34:54.378 --> 01:34:56.276
No, you hang up first.

01:34:56.276 --> 01:34:57.450
Okay.

01:35:07.771 --> 01:35:09.013
Toretto, freeze.

01:35:09.013 --> 01:35:11.809
Time to face the music, Dom.

01:35:11.809 --> 01:35:14.329
You're playing
right into his hands, cop.

01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:53.195
Okay. Come on.

01:35:55.163 --> 01:35:56.854
Oh.

01:35:59.788 --> 01:36:01.341
Yeah.

01:36:11.627 --> 01:36:13.802
Great.

01:36:13.802 --> 01:36:16.115
Just great.

01:36:16.115 --> 01:36:17.944
Shit.

01:36:24.537 --> 01:36:27.022
Little chilly?

01:36:28.506 --> 01:36:29.818
Your plan still sucks.

01:36:29.818 --> 01:36:32.545
Maybe, but at least
you'll be warm.

01:36:33.615 --> 01:36:36.514
"Thank you, Cipher. Thank you."

01:36:45.351 --> 01:36:46.455
- Oh, wow.

01:36:46.455 --> 01:36:47.836
Take a look at this.

01:36:47.836 --> 01:36:49.665
This should cover us
in the gear department.

01:36:49.665 --> 01:36:51.357
You are not to be trusted.

01:36:51.357 --> 01:36:55.154
Hey, you ain't
on my Christmas list either.

01:36:57.190 --> 01:36:59.744
Nothing here is for free.
Let me be clear on that.

01:36:59.744 --> 01:37:01.505
Make sure you get a receipt
from him, okay?

01:37:01.505 --> 01:37:02.851
I'd love to see that.

01:37:02.851 --> 01:37:04.508
Well, I guess Bowie

01:37:04.508 --> 01:37:06.648
wasn't entirely worthless.
I can use his hard drive

01:37:06.648 --> 01:37:08.063
to complete our trace of Dante.

01:37:08.063 --> 01:37:10.583
He's been ten moves ahead of us
this whole time.

01:37:10.583 --> 01:37:12.033
How does he do it by himself?

01:37:12.033 --> 01:37:13.724
Uh, this isn't good.

01:37:13.724 --> 01:37:16.071
Our money, it's been split into
accounts all over the world.

01:37:16.071 --> 01:37:18.246
And look
who they're registered to.

01:37:18.246 --> 01:37:20.938
Those are mercenary kill teams.
Real scum.

01:37:20.938 --> 01:37:22.767
He used our money
to buy an army.

01:37:22.767 --> 01:37:24.769
So this guy doesn't
just want us dead.

01:37:24.769 --> 01:37:26.081
He wants to erase us
off the planet.

01:37:26.081 --> 01:37:27.565
He's trying to tear us apart.

01:37:27.565 --> 01:37:29.636
That's exactly why we need
to link back up with Dom

01:37:29.636 --> 01:37:31.846
at the rendezvous point.

01:37:35.056 --> 01:37:36.643
You need to see this.

01:37:38.714 --> 01:37:40.371
They've been paid to target us

01:37:40.371 --> 01:37:43.892
and anyone who ever helped us
until now.

01:37:46.653 --> 01:37:48.207
Mum.

01:38:10.781 --> 01:38:12.956
I'll have transport
waiting for you.

01:38:12.956 --> 01:38:15.199
And where are you going?

01:38:15.199 --> 01:38:16.994
I'm gonna dig some graves.

01:38:27.763 --> 01:38:29.386
<i>Mr. Nobody's golden boy,</i>

01:38:29.386 --> 01:38:31.560
<i>caught without
so much as a fight.</i>

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.217
That's no fun.

01:38:33.217 --> 01:38:35.081
It's like going
all the way to Everest

01:38:35.081 --> 01:38:36.876
and taking the elevator.

01:38:38.567 --> 01:38:39.983
You might want to buckle up.

01:38:39.983 --> 01:38:43.158
I know you did some good work
for the agency.

01:38:43.158 --> 01:38:46.023
I'm sure you figured
that buys you some leniency.

01:38:46.023 --> 01:38:48.094
But it's a new day.

01:38:48.094 --> 01:38:51.442
That's the problem nowadays.
Nobody listens.

01:38:54.825 --> 01:38:57.483
You should have spent less time
with your head under the hood

01:38:57.483 --> 01:38:59.899
and more time preparing
for what's coming.

01:38:59.899 --> 01:39:02.419
Spies have been replaced
by satellites,

01:39:02.419 --> 01:39:07.355
fighter pilots by drones,
intelligence by an algorithm.

01:39:07.355 --> 01:39:10.116
The days where one man
behind the wheel of a car

01:39:10.116 --> 01:39:12.981
can make a difference
are over, Dom.

01:39:12.981 --> 01:39:15.777
Hell, the days of any man

01:39:15.777 --> 01:39:17.744
behind the wheel of a car
are over.

01:39:20.989 --> 01:39:22.059
What are you doing?

01:39:22.059 --> 01:39:24.682
Preparing for what's to come.

01:39:24.682 --> 01:39:26.615
Right.

01:39:44.461 --> 01:39:45.600
Go. Go. Go.

01:40:02.582 --> 01:40:06.862
Dominic, I brought you back
to where we first met.

01:40:06.862 --> 01:40:08.588
And I have a surprise for you.

01:40:35.029 --> 01:40:36.271
Dom!

01:40:37.479 --> 01:40:39.481
I'm listening now.

01:41:13.619 --> 01:41:14.827
Dominic?

01:41:14.827 --> 01:41:16.139
Dominic!

01:41:16.139 --> 01:41:18.002
Would you stop hurting
my new friends?

01:41:18.002 --> 01:41:20.626
No. I'm only here to hurt you.

01:41:20.626 --> 01:41:21.661
Oh.

01:41:21.661 --> 01:41:24.216
I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:41:24.216 --> 01:41:25.872
That little car stunt
you just did?

01:41:25.872 --> 01:41:26.942
That was pretty awesome.

01:41:26.942 --> 01:41:28.185
Wasn't it?

01:41:28.185 --> 01:41:29.531
It was so cool.

01:41:29.531 --> 01:41:31.740
But if you don't stop,

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:34.847
I'm gonna cut her everywhere.

01:41:34.847 --> 01:41:36.331
Badly.

01:41:41.716 --> 01:41:43.338
There she is.

01:41:43.338 --> 01:41:45.823
- Hmm.
- Fashionably late.

01:41:46.755 --> 01:41:48.171
You got me.

01:41:49.068 --> 01:41:51.035
Mmm.

01:41:51.035 --> 01:41:53.452
- Off you go.

01:41:54.901 --> 01:41:56.800
Family.

01:41:59.147 --> 01:42:02.116
Will you please get off my car?

01:42:04.083 --> 01:42:05.774
- Hmm.

01:42:05.774 --> 01:42:07.604
That is so disrespectful.

01:42:07.604 --> 01:42:09.399
You talk too much.

01:42:23.206 --> 01:42:24.379
Stop, stop!

01:42:24.379 --> 01:42:25.863
You don't know
your own strength.

01:42:29.798 --> 01:42:31.317
You butthole!

01:42:31.317 --> 01:42:33.492
Oh, hey.

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.702
Do you like ballet?

01:42:36.702 --> 01:42:38.324
I adore <i>Swan Lake.</i>

01:42:38.324 --> 01:42:40.223
I feel like you're more of a--
kind of a <i>Nutcracker</i> guy.

01:42:40.223 --> 01:42:43.329
And a one, and a two,
and...

01:42:45.124 --> 01:42:46.746
No!

01:42:52.959 --> 01:42:54.478
Wait for it.

01:42:57.101 --> 01:42:58.655
Oh, no.

01:42:58.655 --> 01:43:01.451
She's in peril.
What will you do?

01:43:03.418 --> 01:43:05.317
You know what your problem is?

01:43:06.904 --> 01:43:09.597
Family.

01:43:10.736 --> 01:43:12.358
You can't save 'em all.

01:43:13.670 --> 01:43:16.569
Five. Four.

01:43:16.569 --> 01:43:17.915
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta.

01:43:17.915 --> 01:43:19.434
Go on.

01:43:19.434 --> 01:43:20.780
Two.

01:43:32.758 --> 01:43:34.553
You don't like ballet.

01:43:34.553 --> 01:43:36.244
I can feel it.

01:43:36.244 --> 01:43:38.212
May I please have the God's Eye?

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:39.834
- Screw you.
- No?

01:43:39.834 --> 01:43:40.938
Pretty please?

01:43:42.319 --> 01:43:43.734
- Oh, there it is.

01:43:43.734 --> 01:43:45.943
Ooh. Gotcha.

01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:49.153
Good trade. Keep the car.

01:43:49.153 --> 01:43:50.914
Oh, Dommy!

01:43:52.226 --> 01:43:56.264
I told you,
you owe me suffering!

01:43:56.264 --> 01:43:58.784
Your legacy isn't money or power

01:43:58.784 --> 01:44:01.269
or the family you built
or the life you led.

01:44:01.269 --> 01:44:04.410
It's the life you made.

01:44:04.410 --> 01:44:07.896
And a father and his son...

01:44:07.896 --> 01:44:09.208
is everything.

01:44:09.208 --> 01:44:11.314
You killed my father
on this bridge.

01:44:11.314 --> 01:44:15.041
And now I know
where to find your son.

01:44:16.905 --> 01:44:19.253
<i>Enchanté.</i>

01:44:28.434 --> 01:44:31.817
You're gonna be okay, Tess.
It went clear through.

01:44:31.817 --> 01:44:33.232
Kinda hurts.

01:44:33.232 --> 01:44:35.303
Your father would be proud.

01:44:35.303 --> 01:44:37.305
Yeah.

01:44:37.305 --> 01:44:39.756
You will stop him.

01:44:41.136 --> 01:44:42.621
Have faith.

01:44:54.184 --> 01:44:55.703
She needs a hospital.

01:44:55.703 --> 01:44:57.601
Mm.

01:45:16.965 --> 01:45:18.967
You're gonna be okay.

01:45:18.967 --> 01:45:20.452
I got her.

01:45:20.452 --> 01:45:22.074
Go save your son.

01:45:23.317 --> 01:45:25.388
My nephew.

01:45:38.573 --> 01:45:42.370
I'm not gonna say I'm sorry,
so let me do you one better.

01:45:42.370 --> 01:45:44.717
Let's get your son.

01:45:49.653 --> 01:45:52.691

01:45:52.691 --> 01:45:56.177

01:46:16.749 --> 01:46:19.062
So, it used to be an old mine,

01:46:19.062 --> 01:46:21.789
and they blasted tunnels
deep into the mountain.

01:46:21.789 --> 01:46:25.068
And I just, uh...

01:46:25.068 --> 01:46:26.587
repurposed the place.

01:46:26.587 --> 01:46:28.934
You just got to keep yourself
open to possibilities.

01:46:28.934 --> 01:46:32.316
And, of course, [sighs] have
a lot of time on your hands.

01:46:32.316 --> 01:46:34.836
You said we'd meet him here.

01:46:39.979 --> 01:46:41.049
Hey.

01:46:42.844 --> 01:46:43.604
You know your dad.

01:46:43.604 --> 01:46:46.020
He's got to make it safe.

01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:47.573
We'll just wait.

01:46:50.127 --> 01:46:52.992
I love you, Uncle Jakob.

01:47:00.897 --> 01:47:01.967
What's that?

01:47:01.967 --> 01:47:05.349
That? Ah, project
I've been working on.

01:47:05.349 --> 01:47:07.628
You wouldn't be interested.

01:47:19.502 --> 01:47:21.952
All right, we're entering
Portuguese airspace.

01:47:21.952 --> 01:47:24.576
Jakob's already there.
Any word from Dom?

01:47:26.888 --> 01:47:28.752
Hey.

01:47:28.752 --> 01:47:30.996
Why are you so quiet?
You all right?

01:47:30.996 --> 01:47:33.481
Just been sitting here
thinking, man.

01:47:33.481 --> 01:47:34.896
I knew I smelled
something burning in here.

01:47:34.896 --> 01:47:39.176
Tej, it was my mission,
y'all took my lead,

01:47:39.176 --> 01:47:41.972
and I messed this thing up
every step of the way.

01:47:41.972 --> 01:47:44.665
I guess this whole...

01:47:44.665 --> 01:47:46.805
leadership thing
really ain't for me.

01:47:46.805 --> 01:47:49.842
You took us to London
on a container.

01:47:49.842 --> 01:47:53.018
You spent thousands of dollars
of your own cash,

01:47:53.018 --> 01:47:54.882
strapped to your ass,

01:47:54.882 --> 01:47:57.540
that now smells like
cheap cologne.

01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:59.542
Now you're sitting here
taking sole responsibility

01:47:59.542 --> 01:48:01.682
for something that we all wear.

01:48:01.682 --> 01:48:03.477
Yeah, I know. It sounds stupid.

01:48:03.477 --> 01:48:04.754
Nah, it don't sound stupid
at all.

01:48:04.754 --> 01:48:06.272
You know what
it sounds like to me?

01:48:06.272 --> 01:48:08.758
That sounds like a leader.

01:48:17.698 --> 01:48:19.976
Come on, man.
Get your ass up, man.

01:48:21.287 --> 01:48:23.358
I love you, man.

01:48:23.358 --> 01:48:24.636
I love you, too, bro.

01:48:24.636 --> 01:48:27.708
Sometimes we got to say,
"I'm sorry."

01:48:27.708 --> 01:48:29.503
I'm sorry for
whupping your ass, man,

01:48:29.503 --> 01:48:31.366
'cause I didn't really mean
to do that.

01:48:31.366 --> 01:48:33.334
The whole thing, it would've
been a whole dif... -

01:48:33.334 --> 01:48:35.474
- You okay? What's wrong?

01:48:35.474 --> 01:48:37.683
I'm just allergic
to your bullshit.

01:48:37.683 --> 01:48:39.271
- Come on.

01:48:42.688 --> 01:48:45.311
Hey, go easy there.
You're gonna break that thing.

01:48:45.311 --> 01:48:47.175
- You all right?

01:48:47.175 --> 01:48:48.798
God's Eye was just used to send

01:48:48.798 --> 01:48:50.903
dozens of mercenaries
after Dom's son.

01:48:50.903 --> 01:48:55.632
Something I created
hurting the people we love.

01:48:58.393 --> 01:49:00.326
It was meant to help.

01:49:00.326 --> 01:49:02.639
This is bigger than just Dante.

01:49:02.639 --> 01:49:04.641
This is bigger than just us.

01:49:04.641 --> 01:49:07.575
We have to stop
this monster now.

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:22.901
We got to go.

01:49:44.198 --> 01:49:45.509
Hold on!

01:49:55.071 --> 01:49:57.107
I got eyes on
Uncle Muscle and the kid.

01:49:57.107 --> 01:49:59.282
All right, everybody,
remember the plan.

01:49:59.282 --> 01:50:01.560
Contain and kidnap. Thank you.

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.320
No.

01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:04.528
No guns.

01:50:04.528 --> 01:50:06.703
I need this little shit alive.

01:50:06.703 --> 01:50:08.291
At least for a while.

01:50:37.838 --> 01:50:40.081
- You ready?
- Ready.

01:50:57.098 --> 01:50:58.721
Holy sh...

01:50:59.445 --> 01:51:00.964
Oh, no, you're good.
You're good.

01:51:00.964 --> 01:51:03.553
Okay, uh, song lyrics,
stubbed toes and cannon cars.

01:51:03.553 --> 01:51:04.830
Yeah.

01:51:09.283 --> 01:51:11.009
Here we go!

01:52:02.543 --> 01:52:04.165
It's stuck. It's stuck.

01:52:07.651 --> 01:52:08.860
They got an army
down there, Dom.

01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:10.862
Your team's not far out.

01:52:10.862 --> 01:52:12.829
- Bring us down.
- I can't put her down here.

01:52:12.829 --> 01:52:14.728
There's an airfield
seven klicks west.

01:52:14.728 --> 01:52:16.868
Okay, we'll meet you there.
Now open the back.

01:52:16.868 --> 01:52:19.836
Dom, there's really
nowhere to land.

01:52:21.562 --> 01:52:23.909
Who said anything about landing?

01:52:41.375 --> 01:52:43.135
Look.

01:52:49.003 --> 01:52:51.005
I'm coming for you, son.

01:53:00.256 --> 01:53:01.567
What the...

01:53:31.839 --> 01:53:33.841
- Dad!
- Hey, son.

01:53:33.841 --> 01:53:35.809
Good to see you, big bro.

01:53:35.809 --> 01:53:38.535
Good to see you guys.
Follow me to that plane.

01:53:38.535 --> 01:53:40.296
We're right behind you.

01:53:42.816 --> 01:53:44.403
I got you now.

01:53:52.515 --> 01:53:54.206
Aimes, we're on our way.

01:53:54.206 --> 01:53:57.175
Dom, I'll be touching down
five klicks west.

01:53:57.175 --> 01:53:58.832
But they're still on your tail.

01:54:00.626 --> 01:54:02.249
It's jammed.

01:54:06.046 --> 01:54:08.738
B, what are you doing?

01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:12.224
Careful.

01:54:13.777 --> 01:54:15.193
Okay, okay, okay.

01:54:23.684 --> 01:54:26.583
Shut the front door.

01:54:26.583 --> 01:54:28.102
Little B.

01:54:34.937 --> 01:54:37.422
Uncle Jakob!

01:54:37.422 --> 01:54:39.389
I fixed it!

01:54:44.463 --> 01:54:45.809
B!

01:54:45.809 --> 01:54:47.363
Toodle-oo.

01:54:49.123 --> 01:54:50.642
- Help!
- Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta. Shut up.

01:54:50.642 --> 01:54:51.919
Damn it.

01:54:51.919 --> 01:54:53.990
You party? I party.

01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:55.923
-  Whoa.

01:54:56.959 --> 01:54:59.547
Dom, I lost him.
Dante has Little B.

01:55:19.084 --> 01:55:21.431
Hey, Dominic.
Welcome to the big showdown.

01:55:21.431 --> 01:55:23.882
It's the last lap.
Check out my copilot.

01:55:23.882 --> 01:55:26.712
- Dad!
- Who could've seen this coming?

01:55:26.712 --> 01:55:28.611
I mean, you know, except for me.

01:55:45.835 --> 01:55:48.424
Shit. Looks like
my fuel line's been shot.

01:55:49.563 --> 01:55:52.911
- I can't get to him, Dom.
- Jakob, stay with me.

01:55:52.911 --> 01:55:55.500
I'm out of this race.

01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:56.950
It has to be you.

01:55:56.950 --> 01:56:00.160
Hey, Dom!
Got a little surprise for you.

01:56:10.032 --> 01:56:12.517
You raised a hell of a son, Dom.

01:56:12.517 --> 01:56:15.623
Time for me to step out
from under your shadow.

01:56:16.659 --> 01:56:18.454
Thanks for showing me the light.

01:56:18.454 --> 01:56:19.800
Jakob?

01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.250
<i>I'm gonna go clear the way.</i>

01:56:22.630 --> 01:56:24.667
Go get your son.

01:56:24.667 --> 01:56:26.013
Jakob, don't!

01:56:26.013 --> 01:56:28.084
- Don't!

01:56:36.886 --> 01:56:38.370
Uncle Jakob!

01:57:02.670 --> 01:57:05.880
Looks like Uncle Muscle won't be
coming to the next barbecue.

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:07.986
Oh.

01:57:07.986 --> 01:57:09.608
I mean, it's very honorable.

01:57:11.127 --> 01:57:13.336
Three miles away.
Take the service road.

01:57:13.336 --> 01:57:15.062
It'll lead you
right to the airfield.

01:57:26.487 --> 01:57:29.249
You know how to beat your dad
in a street race?

01:57:36.704 --> 01:57:38.016
Take away the streets.

01:57:38.016 --> 01:57:39.742
- Dad!

01:57:45.644 --> 01:57:47.508
Amazing.

01:57:47.508 --> 01:57:48.613
Oh.

01:58:02.005 --> 01:58:04.491
We got it.
We got it.

01:58:12.464 --> 01:58:13.465
My turn.

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:40.389
He's good. Your dad's good.

01:58:45.463 --> 01:58:47.154
Dom, you got one mile left.

01:58:47.154 --> 01:58:50.192
Son, I never break a promise.

01:58:50.192 --> 01:58:53.678
Now, let's finish
that driving lesson.

01:58:53.678 --> 01:58:55.162
Feel the car,

01:58:55.162 --> 01:58:57.026
find your line

01:58:57.026 --> 01:58:58.441
and fly.

01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:20.705
- Oh!

01:59:34.995 --> 01:59:37.204
- Now!

01:59:50.838 --> 01:59:51.908
No.

01:59:54.014 --> 01:59:55.222
Take the service road now.

02:00:03.472 --> 02:00:05.405
- I'm wheels down.
- We're headed to you now.

02:00:05.405 --> 02:00:07.407
Your team is on their way.

02:00:07.407 --> 02:00:09.132
I'll meet you at the airfield.

02:00:09.132 --> 02:00:11.238
- You okay?
- I'm good, Dad.

02:00:11.238 --> 02:00:13.551
I'm real proud of you, son.

02:00:58.906 --> 02:01:01.254
Oh, Dommy boy.

02:01:01.254 --> 02:01:03.152
It's so good to see you again.

02:01:03.152 --> 02:01:05.672
Did you hit me with
a helicopter back there?

02:01:05.672 --> 02:01:07.156
Hmm.

02:01:07.156 --> 02:01:09.814
Ow, you big brute.
I mean, I get it.

02:01:09.814 --> 02:01:12.230
You're showing off
in front of your son.

02:01:12.230 --> 02:01:13.611
But honestly,
did you really think

02:01:13.611 --> 02:01:16.614
it was going to be that easy?

02:01:16.614 --> 02:01:19.030
You're exactly
where I wanted you to be.

02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:20.963
Yes.

02:01:20.963 --> 02:01:22.792
Wait for it.

02:01:22.792 --> 02:01:25.036
I got a surprise for you.

02:01:31.732 --> 02:01:34.425
The cavalry's here.
We got you, Dom.

02:01:35.667 --> 02:01:37.807
Roman, get out of here.
It's a trap.

02:01:41.708 --> 02:01:43.088
Incoming!

02:01:58.241 --> 02:01:59.726
Yes!

02:02:00.796 --> 02:02:03.419
See, that's the problem
with having a big family.

02:02:06.974 --> 02:02:08.735
Can't protect 'em all.

02:02:14.016 --> 02:02:15.293
Ooh!

02:02:15.293 --> 02:02:17.640
Oh, Dominic,
is that your new friend?

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:20.022
Aw.

02:02:20.022 --> 02:02:21.679
You are so predictable.

02:02:21.679 --> 02:02:25.096
You think everyone's gonna
end up on your side?

02:02:25.096 --> 02:02:28.341
Problem is Aimes was mine first.

02:02:28.341 --> 02:02:31.723
Now the work begins.

02:02:31.723 --> 02:02:33.346
And in there,

02:02:33.346 --> 02:02:36.349
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

02:02:37.902 --> 02:02:38.972
Let's get started.

02:02:48.395 --> 02:02:50.052
Well, looks like
our partnership's

02:02:50.052 --> 02:02:52.399
off to a fantastic start.

02:02:55.402 --> 02:02:58.163
You know, Dominic,
to become a real saint,

02:02:58.163 --> 02:02:59.924
you have to perform miracles.

02:02:59.924 --> 02:03:02.029
Or die a martyr.

02:03:02.029 --> 02:03:04.135
So what's it gonna be?

02:03:12.385 --> 02:03:16.216
I took your money,
I took your freedom,

02:03:16.216 --> 02:03:18.183
and I'm gonna take your family.

02:03:18.977 --> 02:03:20.393
And you're gonna die

02:03:20.393 --> 02:03:22.567
knowing that
you couldn't save your son.

02:03:25.467 --> 02:03:27.434
Dad.

02:03:27.434 --> 02:03:29.436

02:03:36.961 --> 02:03:39.653

02:03:40.516 --> 02:03:42.725

02:04:03.056 --> 02:04:04.126
