[jazz music]

00:10.635 --> 00:14.848
- * Whatever Lola wants *

00:14.889 --> 00:18.560
* Lola gets *

00:18.601 --> 00:21.980
- Hi, there.
- I don't think so.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.690
- Champagne?
- Not tonight.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.650
- [sighs]

00:26.568 --> 00:28.945
- * Make up your mind *
- What's this?

00:28.987 --> 00:31.239
- Dale and soda.

00:31.281 --> 00:35.201
- * No regrets *

00:35.243 --> 00:37.120
* Recline yourself *

00:37.162 --> 00:38.872
- What do I owe you?

00:38.913 --> 00:40.999
- It's on him.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.168
* *

00:43.209 --> 00:44.878
- Oh, Jesus.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.714
- Cut!
- That's a cut.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.341
- What the fuck? Where is he?
Does he know his cue?

00:49.382 --> 00:50.550
- He knows his cue.
I just can't find him.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.302
- What do you mean
you can't find him?

00:52.344 --> 00:54.679
Try asking one of
his ten assistants.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.890
- Does anyone have
eyes on talent?

00:56.931 --> 00:58.850
He was just here.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.352
- Can I step out for a second?

01:00.393 --> 01:01.478
- Yeah, go.
- Thanks.

01:01.519 --> 01:04.230
- Go ahead.
Everyone, back to one.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.233

01:39.683 --> 01:41.685
- [sighs]

01:41.726 --> 01:43.603
* *

01:43.645 --> 01:46.272
- Why is your trailer sideways?
- Well, there was an accident.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.108
- You don't have to answer.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.318
I know it's because
you're stupid.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.946
- So you guys know
Prada Lamonca, right?

01:52.987 --> 01:54.197
- Hi, I'm Jillian.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.407
- And you probably
don't remember me,

01:55.448 --> 01:56.700
but I was at your seminar.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.994
- "You probably don't
remember me" was perfect.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.496
- Okay, here's the deal.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.039
Rodney wants to launch
our supplement line

02:03.081 --> 02:05.500
in three months, Prada will be
overseeing production,

02:05.542 --> 02:07.711
and I'm the new head manager
for Predator Power.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.504
- What the hell is
Predator Power?

02:09.546 --> 02:11.339
- Well, Rodney thought
"saw palmetto extract" had

02:11.381 --> 02:13.466
limp dick vibes, so we're
mixing in shark cartilage

02:13.508 --> 02:16.177
and changing the name:
Predator Power.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.429
"Get predatory."

02:17.470 --> 02:19.556
- Predator as in
sexual predator?

02:19.597 --> 02:21.307
- Sounds a little problematic.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.934
- Rodney says
controversy sells.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.811
You know his first real estate
book was called

02:24.853 --> 02:27.522
"Kill Your Parents,
Sell Their House."

02:27.564 --> 02:29.399
It's a New York Times
best seller.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.192
- I'm sorry, what is all this?

02:31.234 --> 02:33.403
- Oh, those are
our payroll numbers.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.863
- "Those are
our payroll numbers."

02:34.904 --> 02:36.990
Yeah, I know what they are.

02:37.032 --> 02:40.535
But why does a small farm
have so many employees

02:40.577 --> 02:42.078
and why are they all related?

02:42.120 --> 02:44.289
- Oh, uh, those are the Boones.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.790
They're a key part of the team

02:45.832 --> 02:49.502
in so far as they provide
extra legal services.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.589
- Okay. You bought protection
from some crooks.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.507
Got it.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.135
- So the Boones, huh?

02:57.177 --> 03:00.013
You out here doing side deals
with criminals now, hmm?

03:00.055 --> 03:01.639
You know all those years
when I was a criminal,

03:01.681 --> 03:03.099
all I wanted from you was
a side deal

03:03.141 --> 03:04.476
and you gave me nothing.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.561
- You stole my dream, Isaiah.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.064
- Why are you focusing
on the past?

03:09.105 --> 03:10.732
That's yesterday's shit.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.942
You need to be looking
to tomorrow,

03:12.984 --> 03:13.943
which is when the future is.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.653
- Oh, is that when
the future is?

03:15.695 --> 03:17.405
You been spending too much time
with Rodney Lamonca.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.074
You sound like
a fucking Dominine hat.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.909
- Well, it's a good thing
I'm spending time with Rodney

03:20.950 --> 03:23.870
because we're launching
Predator Power at the NFS con.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.539
It's a nutrition--
- And food sciences convention.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.124
Yeah, I was looking forward
to attending

03:28.166 --> 03:29.709
while I still owned
my own farm.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.836
- Well, pack your bags because
I talked Rodney into

03:31.878 --> 03:33.088
letting you both go.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.216
Free trip to San Diego, baby!
City of zoos.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.551
- Fuck San Diego.
Fucking diet Miami.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.346
- I mean, a business trip
sounds kind of fun.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.889
The furthest I ever went
for work was when

03:42.931 --> 03:45.684
an Uber passenger had me drive
him to Charlotte.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.561
He was on drugs and bought me
Bojangles twice. It was great.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.064
- You haven't even heard
the best part yet, J Glopp.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.316
Rodney has a celebrity
spokesperson lined up

03:53.358 --> 03:55.652
and we need someone
to brief him on

03:55.694 --> 03:57.946
the magical healing powers of
saw palmetto.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.073
And since you two are
the experts,

04:00.115 --> 04:03.910
you get to hang out with
Mr. Worldwide himself.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.995
Fucking Pitbull, huh?

04:06.037 --> 04:07.789
- Wow! Pitbull?

04:07.831 --> 04:10.250
I've given people rides home
from his concert before.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.920
They always seem very horny.
- Mm.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.755
Why you over there
being so quiet?

04:15.797 --> 04:17.424
Is it because
you're too horny to talk?

04:17.465 --> 04:21.636
- It's because I don't want
to do this.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.013
- I'm sorry about the farm.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.682
Okay, I got myself in
a bad situation in Phoenix

04:25.724 --> 04:27.934
and this was the only way
I could think to get out of it.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.603
And I feel really fucking bad
and I want to help you,

04:30.645 --> 04:33.773
so please just let me help you.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.316
- I really don't have a choice,
do I?

04:37.777 --> 04:38.903
- Man--

04:43.408 --> 04:45.952
- Wow. First class.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.830
I can't believe they let you
board before everybody else.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.332
I've never had anyone jealous
of me before.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.085
I heard one guy call me
a rich bitch.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.297
- Look at all this leg room
and lay flat seats.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.924
You know what it's like for
a guy my height to fly coach?

04:59.966 --> 05:02.177
It's like trying to jam
a GI Joe into a Hot Wheels.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.470
- Champagne?
- Ooh.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.180
- No, thank you.
- I think it's complimentary.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.514
- Then yes, please.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.184
Can I keep the glass?
- Sure.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.394
- You should ask for yours too.
Then we'll have a set.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.520
- I'm not gonna do that.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.898
- Well, I still really
love this.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.525
Maybe it was all worth it
working for the Lamoncas.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.320
- No. Remember why
you're doing this, okay?

05:20.362 --> 05:23.114
We just need to earn
enough money to buy a new farm.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.742
- You really think we can?
- Yes, I do, Jillian.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.161
In fact, I've already found us
the perfect plot of swamp land.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.496
- What?

05:29.537 --> 05:30.622
- Well, "perfect" might be
an overstatement.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.582
The Boones were right, okay?

05:32.624 --> 05:34.668
The pharmaceutical companies
bought up

05:34.709 --> 05:37.671
the entire Everglades.
Prices are insane.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.757
Down payment is 100 grand.
- Oh, wow.

05:40.799 --> 05:44.052
But I guess that's only two
years of our Dominine salaries

05:44.094 --> 05:46.471
assuming we don't eat,

05:46.513 --> 05:49.265
pay taxes, or sleep inside.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.767
- We can still sleep inside.

05:50.809 --> 05:54.270
It'll just be more like
five years of saving.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.189
- Okay, wow.

05:56.231 --> 06:00.151
Five year plan to get us back
to where we were one month ago.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.653
I don't know why I said
that last bit.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.863
This is exciting.
- To starting over.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.241
- To starting over.
[glasses clink]

06:06.282 --> 06:09.244
[upbeat music]

06:09.285 --> 06:10.537
- Oh, my God, Craig, look.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.288
This hotel has
free sewing kits.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.666
Now, my bra can get
a few more months of life.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.084
- Hey, good for you.
[door opens]

06:16.126 --> 06:18.253
- Welcome to San Diego.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.462
Sweet suite, right?

06:19.504 --> 06:21.089
You guys check out
the bathroom?

06:21.131 --> 06:22.716
Got a special spout
for your bootyhole.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.260
- It's whatever.
Hotels are gross.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.512
Fucking...used beds.
- Hey.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.722
I was just downstairs
at the conference.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.056
You know what I saw?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.891
Three booths selling
saw palmetto extract.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.060
- I know, but we got that
shark collagen there, boss.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.520
We the only ones doing
that shit.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.814
- I also think saw palmetto on
its own has some

06:37.856 --> 06:40.775
pretty amazing properties
that can really help people.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.528
- Holy shit. Has that always
been your accent?

06:43.570 --> 06:44.571
- Yes.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.740
- It sucks. Fix it.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.576
Anyway, I got a great idea
for us to stand out.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.245
Really make CVS' panties slick.

06:52.287 --> 06:55.540
We say that Predator Power
pills prevent prostate cancer.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.585
- No. You can't say something
cures cancers if it doesn't.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.962
- I said prevents cancer,
Craig.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.797
- No offense, but do you really
think people gonna believe

07:02.839 --> 07:04.883
you found the cure for cancer?

07:04.924 --> 07:06.593
I mean, you're not exactly
a scientist.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.261
You're wearing a shiny shirt.

07:08.303 --> 07:12.098
- All right, let me let you in
on a little secret here, okay?

07:12.140 --> 07:15.101
People want to be lied to.
- I don't want to be lied to.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.562
- Well, not you personally.
You're one of the smart ones.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.023
- Oh, okay.
- See? Right there.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.483
Tell people
what they want to hear

07:21.524 --> 07:23.151
and these idiots will
believe anything.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.112
- Look, Rodney,
I think they have a point.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.490
All right, this is a conference
for real businessmen.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.368
Not the normal Dominine...

07:31.409 --> 07:33.119
- Losers and fuckwads, yeah.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.497
- I just think these people
might be harder to scam.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.956
But we don't have to scam 'em.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.251
We got Pitbull.
Mr. Worldwide, Mr. 305.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.420
- All right, whatever,
but Pitbull better bring it.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.922
And you two need to go
brief him.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.924
He's up in the penthouse.
Top floor.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.801
- We know what penthouse means.
- Top floor, got it.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.721
- Wow.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.517
- [laughs]
Welcome.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.726
I'm Pitbull.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.144
Let's make this a great day.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.522
- Let's do it.
- You want to live life.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.816
Don't let life live you.
- Oh, for sure.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.443
- If you work hard, let that be
the fuel to your fire.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.986
- I will.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.905
- But don't forget to enjoy

08:08.947 --> 08:11.366
the glow of that fire.
[laughs]

08:11.408 --> 08:13.201
- I won't.
- Dale!

08:13.243 --> 08:14.994
- Hey, so we're here to
brief you on

08:15.036 --> 08:16.913
saw palmetto facts.
- Yeah, come in. Have a seat.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.873
I personally like to stand.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.127
I always keep to my feet to
stay ready to hustle, grind,

08:22.168 --> 08:23.503
make my dreams a reality.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.879
- Yeah, me too.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.257
I'm always just standing up
for the same reason.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.883
- Mm, mm.
- To hustle.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.760
- Okay, so five facts about
saw palmetto--

08:30.802 --> 08:32.846
- Right on.
Before we get to work,

08:32.887 --> 08:34.097
would you like some
refreshments?

08:34.139 --> 08:37.934
I've got some chili lime
kiki rikis.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.563
They're the official corn chip
of Mr. Worldwide.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.064
- Oh, wow. They're so spicy.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.983
- Where you from?
- Australia.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.737
- Oh, well, maybe in Australia,
you're okay with average chips.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.573
But where I'm from,
in my household, in Miami,

08:51.614 --> 08:52.532
there better be some heat,
papí.

08:52.574 --> 08:53.950
[laughter]

08:53.992 --> 08:55.744
You want some diet Doctor
Blanco to wash that down?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.203
- Sure.
- Diet Doctor Blanco?

08:57.245 --> 08:59.831
- It's the official clear cola
of Mr. Worldwide.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.709
It's all the flavor
with none of the guilt.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.169
Dale!
both: Dale!

09:06.254 --> 09:07.881
- [sighs]

09:07.922 --> 09:10.216
My soda's got the hardest
working fizz in the biz.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.344
Ah!

09:12.385 --> 09:14.512
- Oh, Mr. Pitbull, your...

09:14.554 --> 09:16.222
- Hmm?
- Little beard.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.141
- Your soul patch.
- It's on the can.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.894
- Oh, oh. [chuckles]
Shit, sorry.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.229
[clears throat]
What we talking about?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.857
The delicious taste of
diet Doctor Blanco.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.193
- Um, Mr. Pitbull,

09:28.234 --> 09:30.278
would it be possible to
give us a second?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.613
- Yeah, sure.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.290
- That's not Pitbull.
- What?

09:42.332 --> 09:44.668
- His soul patch came off.
He doesn't even look like him.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.336
- Course it's not
fucking Pitbull.

09:46.378 --> 09:47.420
- You knew?
- What?

09:47.462 --> 09:48.838
- Yeah,
it's a Pitbull impersonator.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.924
Certified by
Mr. Worldwide International.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.842
These doubles
look like Pitbull,

09:52.884 --> 09:54.219
they sound like Pitbull,

09:54.260 --> 09:56.179
they even fucking smell like
Pitbull.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.473
They wear the actual clothes
the real Pitbull sweat through.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.933
- Sounds kind of gross.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.768
- You know what's gross
is smelling like a nobody.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.687
- But people must know
it's not Pitbull.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.230
- You forgot what
I already taught you:

10:05.271 --> 10:08.066
people want to be lied to.
They want to go home and

10:08.108 --> 10:09.943
tell their fucking nurse
practitioner friends that

10:09.984 --> 10:11.528
they met Pitbull on
a business trip.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.114
- Yeah, sure, but we knew
he was fake right away.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.782
- It's 'cause you got up close.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.701
Pitbull 6 is
a long distance Pitbull.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.161
He's rated for stage work
and tarmac waving.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.538
I'm not gonna spend
two million bucks

10:21.579 --> 10:23.581
on a sunglasses off Pitbull.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.958
Now, get back up to
the penthouse

10:25.000 --> 10:27.460
and do your fucking job.
Top floor!

10:27.502 --> 10:29.462
- Top floor, got it.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.717
- So do we call you Pitbull 6
or do you have a real name?

10:33.758 --> 10:36.469
- Call me Pitbull because
that's who I am.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.930
And if anybody heard you use
my actual name, I'd be fired.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.640
- Damn, Pitbull's a tough boss.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.225
- Pitbull is an incredible boss

10:42.267 --> 10:43.810
and a naturally funny
conversationalist

10:43.852 --> 10:45.478
who could do standup
if he wanted.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.273
It's Mr. Worldwide
International who are tough.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.900
My handler Linda,
she's always on my ass.

10:50.942 --> 10:54.988
- Okay, Pitbull, um,
there are five key benefits

10:55.030 --> 10:56.948
to saw palmetto
we'd like you to mention.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.367
Prostate reduction,
hair growth,

10:59.409 --> 11:00.910
which we thought you could
make a funny joke

11:00.952 --> 11:02.412
because you're bald.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.414
- Pitbull is bald by choice.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.624
If he wanted to have hair,
it'd be down to his butt.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.917
Your joke won't work.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.669
- Well, there's also
increased libido.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.005
- Pitbull's libido
is incredible.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.591
He has so much sex,
we don't even masturbate.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.176
And he only has sex with
Miami tens.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.719
You know what
a Miami ten looks like?

11:17.761 --> 11:19.304
Like a stripper from
Grand Theft Auto.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.723
- Did you say,
"we don't even masturbate?"

11:21.765 --> 11:24.809
- Yeah, because everybody knows
Pitbull doesn't masturbate.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.353
- Does everyone know that?
- Yeah.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.022
So if I got caught,
that'd be as bad for the brand

11:29.064 --> 11:32.067
as me being, I don't know,
seen on a date with some woman

11:32.108 --> 11:34.110
from my past who's not up to
Pitbull's standards.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.945
- So you can't date either?

11:35.987 --> 11:39.699
- [laughs] Of course not.
Bad for the brand.

11:39.741 --> 11:42.077
Think what people would say
if they saw me out with Heather

11:42.118 --> 11:45.830
who is so, so beautiful,
but not a Miami ten.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.582
- Is Heather your girlfriend?

11:47.624 --> 11:49.834
- [laughing] Not anymore.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.544
It's bad for the brand.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.755
She wanted to start a family

11:53.797 --> 11:56.466
and I wanted to be a father
so bad,

11:56.508 --> 11:59.844
but a bunch of little me's
running around calling me papí,

11:59.886 --> 12:02.430
that--that's not Pitbull.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.183
[laughs]
- I'm so sorry.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.935
Do you need a drink
or something?

12:06.976 --> 12:09.062
- Oh, I'd love a drink,
but I'm not allowed.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.064
- Bad for the brand.
- It's bad for the brand.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.982
- This is insane.
You're a human being.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.901
You should be able to make
your own choices.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.737
- No, Linda would find out.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.114
She would always find out.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.365
- It's just
the three of us here.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.409
Nobody's gonna say anything.
Have a drink.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.452
I promise you'll feel
so much better.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.789
- You know we have to stay
within a pound of

12:27.831 --> 12:31.251
Pitbull's actual weight
at all times?

12:31.292 --> 12:32.919
And sometimes he goes
so hard on stage,

12:32.961 --> 12:34.629
he sweats off five pounds.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.340
You know what that means
for me?

12:37.382 --> 12:39.009
- Do you think you've
had enough?

12:39.050 --> 12:40.844
- Man, you sound just like
fucking Linda.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.971
"You can't drink anymore,
Pitt 6.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.931
Why'd you stop going to
your meetings, Pitt 6?"

12:44.973 --> 12:47.600
- Meetings?
- So it's not all Pitbulls

12:47.642 --> 12:50.020
who can't have alcohol.
That was just a rule for you?

12:50.061 --> 12:51.271
- Of course it's just for me.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.273
I'm the only Pitbull with
a drinking problem.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.275
And they're afraid of me
because they know

12:55.316 --> 12:58.319
my solo music is
better than Pitbull's.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.655
Linda's intimidated by
my talent.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.157
Listen to this.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.910
This track's called
"I Love Dunking Basketballs."

13:05.952 --> 13:07.287
[chuckles]

13:07.328 --> 13:08.913
* I see a big, fat hoop *

13:08.955 --> 13:09.998
* You know I got to dunk *

13:10.040 --> 13:11.499
- Hey, hey, we really want to

13:11.541 --> 13:14.461
hear the rest of your music,
but I'ma call room service,

13:14.502 --> 13:15.837
order you a pot of
black coffee.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.130
- I can't drink coffee.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.257
I'm only allowed to drink
CocoVOLT,

13:19.299 --> 13:21.885
the official chocolate
energy drink of Mr. Worldwide.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.470
- Or maybe you should
take a nap.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.681
You might just need a little
break from being Pitbull.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.308
- You know what?

13:28.350 --> 13:31.144
That's actually a great idea.
I do need a break.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.146
- Okay, good.
- I fucking quit this job.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.939
- What? No!
- Fuck Pitbull.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.108
Fuck Mr. Worldwide. Fuck Linda.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.568
I'm going to masturbate.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.658
- You lost Pitbull?
- A Pitbull.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.826
- This is a disaster.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.620
- People will understand.
Mix-ups happen.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.872
I wore mismatched socks today.
It's cute.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.457
- Shh. Shut up.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.751
You know how much money I sunk
into this saw palmetto shit?

13:54.793 --> 13:56.753
- Oh, I don't know.
Including the free farm

13:56.795 --> 13:58.588
that you stole from me? $0?

13:58.630 --> 14:00.006
- I'm talking about
the conference.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.509
The booth, all the merch.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.010
Just renting the Pitbull
was how much?

14:04.052 --> 14:05.345
- 300 grand.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.222
- That seems like
a wild use of money.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.308
- No, paying you two a salary
is the wild use of money.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.852
You better find this guy.
If you don't, you're fired.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.354
- We'll find him. Don't worry.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.855
- Isaiah, you brought these
two dipshits in.

14:15.897 --> 14:16.981
You go with them and make sure

14:17.023 --> 14:18.066
they don't trip on
their own dicks

14:18.108 --> 14:19.234
trying to work a doorknob.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.235
- I know how to work
a doorknob.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.653
- I don't have a dick.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.988
- So you have no idea
where he went.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.615
You just watched him run away.

14:25.657 --> 14:26.574
Why didn't you go after him?

14:26.616 --> 14:28.284
- He was so fast.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.704
I don't approve of
Mr. Worldwide International's

14:30.745 --> 14:32.288
dietary restrictions,

14:32.330 --> 14:34.416
but he seemed to be in
incredible shape.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.251
- Hey, be honest, Craig.
You trying to get fired?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.502
'Cause I don't know what
you think

14:37.544 --> 14:39.295
Dominine severance pay is,
but it's bad.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.381
- No. I don't want to
get fired.

14:41.423 --> 14:44.259
I hate this job, but I need it.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.886
We got to buy a new farm,
plus Vanessa and Camille

14:46.928 --> 14:48.763
and the little white baby that
none of us are related to

14:48.805 --> 14:50.432
are counting on me.
- What are you talking about?

14:50.473 --> 14:51.975
- Oh, it's a long and
interesting story

14:52.017 --> 14:52.976
that I don't have to tell you

14:53.018 --> 14:54.436
because we're not close
no more.

14:54.477 --> 14:57.272
- Guys, look. Pitbull 6 left
his phone in the room.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.274
Phones are full of clues.
- It's locked.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.442
How are we supposed to
get his passcode?

15:00.483 --> 15:03.570
- How about 305?
He is Mr. 305.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.405
- A three digit passcode?

15:05.447 --> 15:07.115
Those don't exist, Isaiah.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.284
I'm learning you're dumb
and a dick.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.535
It's a terrible combination.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.329
- Mm, and we're in.
- That's annoying.

15:13.371 --> 15:17.208
Limited contacts. Pitbull 7,
Pitbull 8, Pitbull 10.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.752
What happened to Pitbull 9?

15:18.793 --> 15:20.879
- Oh.
- What?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.881
- Maybe seven ate nine.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.175
- Jillian.
- Sorry.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.801
- Fuck it. One of these guys
gotta know something.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.845
[line rings]

15:28.887 --> 15:30.263
- 6, what's up?

15:30.305 --> 15:31.723
I'm at the Doctor Blanco
launch event.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.641
- This isn't 6.
I'm actually a client.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.226
Pitbull 6 had a bit of
a freak out

15:35.268 --> 15:36.770
and we sort of lost him.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.481
- Ah, fuck.
What'd he freak out about?

15:39.522 --> 15:41.775
- I think he got fed up with
all the Pitbull rules.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.693
Mr. Worldwide International
doesn't seem like

15:43.735 --> 15:45.111
an easy place to work.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.655
- Oh, shit.
Was he performing at a wedding?

15:47.697 --> 15:49.491
Weddings always make him
think about Heather.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.368
- I just wanted to see if
you knew his name

15:51.409 --> 15:53.370
or had any idea
where he might've gone.

15:53.411 --> 15:57.290
- Nah. We were only allowed to
talk about Pitbull stuff.

15:57.332 --> 16:00.335
If they catch us socializing,
that's two fireballs.

16:00.377 --> 16:04.172
And three fireballs
is a timber.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.049
That means you going down.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.843
- They don't know shit.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.095
- Well, just call the company.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.012
They got to have a way
to track him down.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.555
- No, we're not calling Linda.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.349
I don't want him to get in
trouble with his boss.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.725
- It'll be fine.
I promise I won't

16:15.767 --> 16:17.227
tell Linda he was drinking.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.479
[phone rings]

16:19.521 --> 16:22.607
- Mr. Worldwide International.
You have Linda Fox Platt.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.693
- Hi, I'm from Dominine.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.528
Uh, we lost our Pitbull.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.197
- Fucking 6. Was he drinking
on the job again?

16:29.239 --> 16:30.198
- No.
- No, no, no.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.533
Nothing like that.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.535
- I told the hotel to
clean out the mini-bar,

16:33.576 --> 16:35.829
but everyone's a dumb fuck.
[keyboard clicking]

16:35.870 --> 16:39.040
All right, it looks like he's
about 15 miles from the hotel.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.167
- How do you know that?

16:41.209 --> 16:42.252
- Well, he's got
a company phone.

16:42.293 --> 16:43.837
They're easy to track.

16:43.878 --> 16:47.090
- Well, we're on his phone.
We--we called you from it.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.260
- Okay, look.

16:50.301 --> 16:54.431
Here's the deal.
You cannot tell anyone this.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.976
When I make my doubles
get their tattoos

16:58.018 --> 16:59.644
so that they match Pitbull,

16:59.686 --> 17:02.272
we also insert a subcutaneous
tracking device.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.898
- Oh, my God.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.609
- Sorry, but I got shithead
bosses breathing down my neck.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.863
I could get fired if one of
my Pitts goes missing.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.365
Just to be clear, I am not
complaining about Pitbull.

17:12.407 --> 17:15.243
The real Pitbull is an amazing
boss and businessman

17:15.285 --> 17:17.871
who actually had the idea
for Amazon,

17:17.912 --> 17:19.956
but knew he could do more good
through his music.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.750
- We all love Pitbull, Linda.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.002
Can you please just tell us
where 6 went?

17:24.044 --> 17:25.170
- Hold on.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.256
- It says he's in there.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.633
Guess he really needed
that drink.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.094
- No, he's here for
something worse.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.722
Open mic night.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.683
[phone buzzing]

17:40.935 --> 17:42.729
- Hello?
- Hey, it's 12.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.190
I just wanted to see if
you found 6 yet.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.483
I'm starting to worry
this might be

17:46.524 --> 17:48.860
another Pitbull 9 situation.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.196
- What do you mean?
What happened to Pitbull 9?

17:51.237 --> 17:53.198
- Ah, man,
he was the best of us.

17:53.239 --> 17:56.409
He looked and moved exactly
like Pitbull.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.286
Man, certified for
concert work,

17:58.328 --> 18:00.080
but it got too much.

18:00.121 --> 18:03.500
Always dancing, never sleeping.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.419
I don't know
when the pills started,

18:06.461 --> 18:07.921
but I know when they stopped.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.006
One day he was shooting
a commercial for Dale,

18:10.048 --> 18:12.300
Pitbull's new tequila.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.135
They found him dead backstage.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.512
- Oh, my God.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.389
- Linda said it was
an accident.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.600
But how do you slit both wrists
by accident?

18:20.642 --> 18:22.435
- Well, we know where 6 is.
He's alive.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.604
I'll make sure
nothing bad happens.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.272
- Oh, thank God.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.275
How'd you find him?

18:29.317 --> 18:31.194
- Um...

18:31.236 --> 18:33.321
you know, looking hard.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.156
General searching.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.617
- They always fucking find us.

18:37.659 --> 18:39.536
How do they always find us?

18:39.577 --> 18:41.496
- Okay, look, I'm not supposed
to tell you this,

18:41.538 --> 18:43.289
but Linda has
a tracking device on you.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.667
It's in your tattoo.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.961
- What the fuck?

18:48.003 --> 18:51.047
So I'm chipped like a dog?

18:51.089 --> 18:54.551
- Jillian, you coming?
- I'm so sorry. I have to go.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.848
- This is my original single.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.142
"Nothing Like Sunshine
On Your Birthday."

19:02.183 --> 19:06.438
[upbeat music playing]

19:06.479 --> 19:08.023
* You happy when it's sunny
on your birthday *

19:08.064 --> 19:09.899
* You're sad when it's cloudy
on your birthday *

19:09.941 --> 19:11.985
* Baby girl, don't cry,
the sun's gonna shine *

19:12.027 --> 19:14.029
* You're gonna be happy
on your birthday *

19:14.070 --> 19:15.030
[music stops]

19:15.071 --> 19:16.281
Hey.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.907
The crowd was
just getting into it.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.368
- If even one person wants to
hear what this dude is singing,

19:20.410 --> 19:23.538
please raise your hand.
- Well, I loved it.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.583
It had such a great message
about, uh,

19:26.624 --> 19:28.585
being happy on your birthday.

19:28.626 --> 19:31.880
- Yeah, man, you're a real
shooting star, but--

19:31.921 --> 19:34.382
- You want me to go back
to the conference.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.134
Yeah, I know why you're here.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.803
Relax. I wouldn't leave you
hanging like that.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.848
Ryan Mildo's gonna blow
the roof off that place.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.725
- What?
- Who the fuck is Ryan Mildo?

19:43.767 --> 19:45.894
- Me.
Now you know my real name.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.395
And soon, the rest of
the world will too.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.856
- Mildo like dildo.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.900
- It rhymes with dildo.
It's not like dildo.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.861
- Okay, I'm sorry. What the
fuck is happening here?

19:54.903 --> 19:56.863
'Cause you really think you
gonna start over

19:56.905 --> 19:59.991
as a grown-ass man
and become a pop star.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.576
- I mean, maybe.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.370
I know it's not gonna happen
overnight,

20:03.411 --> 20:05.413
but if being Pitbull's
taught me one thing,

20:05.455 --> 20:07.540
it's how to hustle and grind.

20:07.582 --> 20:09.167
I've got a five year plan.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.544
- A fucking five year plan.

20:11.586 --> 20:15.256
Look, let me let you in on
a little secret, Mildo.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.592
Being poor sucks.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.135
- I was broke before
I got this job

20:19.177 --> 20:21.012
and it was fine. I was happy.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.931
- Yeah, yeah,
most poor people happy.

20:22.972 --> 20:26.059
They eat their combo meals,
they watch TV, they go to bed.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.645
But the only reason
they can sleep is because

20:28.687 --> 20:32.732
they don't know
how good rich people got it.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.192
I mean, they think they
understand because they watch

20:34.234 --> 20:36.903
a episode of "Entourage,"

20:36.945 --> 20:39.823
but they can't even begin
to imagine how easy

20:39.864 --> 20:42.450
everyday life is
for some people.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.036
But not you.
[laughs]

20:45.078 --> 20:46.746
You, you fucking know, Mildo.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.541
The penthouses, Miami tens.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.002
What they got you flying now?
What, first class?

20:52.043 --> 20:53.378
- Private.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.965
- Fucking PJs?

20:57.007 --> 20:58.591
You ate the fruit from
the Tree of Knowledge

20:58.633 --> 21:03.263
and ain't no going back now,
Mildo.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.306
Let me tell you about
your little five year plan.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.641
You gon' wake up every day

21:06.683 --> 21:09.185
and you are going
to be furious.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.187
Furious at the struggle.

21:11.229 --> 21:12.647
Furious at the unfairness.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.816
Furious at Pitbull.

21:14.858 --> 21:18.111
And that fury is gonna
eat away and eat away

21:18.153 --> 21:21.448
and eat away at you until
there's nothing good left,

21:21.489 --> 21:24.909
so what's it gonna be, Mildo?

21:24.951 --> 21:28.538
* *

21:28.580 --> 21:30.874
- Please...

21:33.043 --> 21:34.502
Call me Pitbull.

21:36.379 --> 21:37.839
- [laughs]
Look who we found.

21:37.881 --> 21:41.259
Mr. Worldwide himself.
Mr. 305. Mr...

21:41.301 --> 21:42.844
- What the fuck did you do?

21:42.886 --> 21:44.763
- We are more than
just Pitbulls.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.222
- We are human beings.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.475
- With our own lives
and our own names.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.477
- Our rights have been ignored.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.520
- And we've been stripped of
basic dignities.

21:52.562 --> 21:53.855
- Like our right to privacy.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.648
- And our right to love
who we want.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.025
- We will not dance.

21:57.067 --> 21:57.901
- We will not sing.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.903
- We will not start the party.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.905
- Operations at
Mr. Worldwide International

22:01.946 --> 22:03.823
are hereby ceased.

22:03.865 --> 22:04.866
- Dale!

22:04.908 --> 22:06.993
- It's a Mr. Worldwide walkout.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.912
Pitbull's gonna be
so fucking pissed!

22:13.041 --> 22:13.958
- Well, you two dunces
lit a match.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.168
Now, the whole thing's on fire.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.586
Pitbull put out a statement.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.046
Apparently, he didn't know
anything about

22:18.088 --> 22:20.048
the working conditions
of his doubles.

22:20.090 --> 22:21.341
You know one of them
killed himself?

22:21.383 --> 22:22.425
- We did know that, yes.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.094
- Yeah, well, Pitbull didn't.

22:24.135 --> 22:27.263
And now, he's taking a step
back to listen and learn.

22:27.305 --> 22:28.890
And since nobody listens harder

22:28.932 --> 22:31.559
or steps back further
than Pitbull,

22:31.601 --> 22:33.395
he's shutting down
the whole program.

22:33.436 --> 22:34.896
He's pulling
all his endorsements.

22:34.938 --> 22:37.774
He's even pulling
diet Doctor Blanco.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.401
- Pitbull's on in one minute.

22:39.442 --> 22:40.694
- Oh, this is
a fucking disaster.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.737
- So why don't you do it?
You can sell anything.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.239
- [scoffs] You think
I'm gonna get up on stage

22:44.280 --> 22:46.408
and talk about
how I have penis problems?

22:46.449 --> 22:48.660
So everybody thinks I got
a piddly little booger dick

22:48.702 --> 22:50.787
that squirts clear? Fuck that.

22:50.829 --> 22:52.205
My shit is hard as a rock

22:52.247 --> 22:54.624
and it shoots Elmer's
by the fucking gallon.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.543
- Saw palmetto berries
help with the prostate,

22:56.584 --> 22:57.711
not the penis.

22:57.752 --> 23:00.213
- The prostate is the penis!
Grow up!

23:00.255 --> 23:01.965
- So what are we gonna do?
The crowd's waiting.

23:02.007 --> 23:04.175
- I don't know.
Just call the whole thing off.

23:04.217 --> 23:07.178
Say Pitbull got sick
and you two are fired.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.263
Clean out your hotel rooms.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.848
I'm cancelling
your plane tickets home.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.182
- How do we get back?

23:11.224 --> 23:13.518
- Imagine me giving one, tiny,
little mini fuck.

23:13.560 --> 23:18.273
You could walk home
for all I care.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.316
- You know what?

23:20.358 --> 23:22.068
Fine. We don't need you.

23:22.110 --> 23:25.113
Or your fancy hotels
or your champagne planes

23:25.155 --> 23:28.283
because we're gonna build
a new farm from the ground up

23:28.324 --> 23:30.076
where we treat people right.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.620
And it doesn't matter
how hard we have to work

23:32.662 --> 23:34.080
or how long it takes
because this...

23:34.122 --> 23:35.582
- Actually,
if I could interject.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.000
- Kind of in the middle of
a big speech.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.918
- I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I just--

23:38.960 --> 23:41.504
I think there's a way we can
still fix this Pitbull thing.

23:41.546 --> 23:42.672
- Exactly.

23:42.714 --> 23:44.674
Who needs Pitbull when
you have Ryan...

23:44.716 --> 23:47.260
- You're not getting on stage,
Mildo.

23:47.302 --> 23:50.722
- Ladies and gentlemen,
for Dominine,

23:50.764 --> 23:53.600
the moment
you've all been waiting for.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.018
- What are you gonna do?

23:55.060 --> 23:56.895
- Go out there and try to sell
Predator Power.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.229
Can't lose our jobs, Jillian,

23:58.271 --> 23:59.773
not if we want to save up
for our own farm.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.024
- I mean, I guess you're right,

24:01.066 --> 24:03.401
but people are
expecting Pitbull.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.694
Are you gonna dance?

24:04.736 --> 24:06.279
I'm realizing now
I've never seen you dance.

24:06.321 --> 24:07.530
Maybe you're amazing at it.

24:07.572 --> 24:09.532
- I am an amazing dancer,
but not tonight.

24:09.574 --> 24:13.203
Just tell them about all
the good saw palmetto can do.

24:13.244 --> 24:14.454
Okay?

24:14.496 --> 24:16.289
- * Four, three, two, one *

24:16.331 --> 24:18.458
* *

24:18.500 --> 24:20.251
* Come on *

24:20.293 --> 24:25.048
- Please welcome
Mr. Worldwide, Mr. 305,

24:25.090 --> 24:30.845
the one, the only, Pitbull!

24:34.724 --> 24:37.435
- Uh, hey.

24:37.477 --> 24:41.398
I know you're excited to see
Pitbull, but...

24:41.439 --> 24:45.944
he's not coming. Sorry.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.947
Look, I could stand here
and tell you

24:48.988 --> 24:52.242
Pitbull got sick,
but I'm not gonna lie.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.494
The truth is,
the endorsement fell through.

24:54.536 --> 24:58.123
Business shit.
It happens.

24:58.164 --> 25:01.167
But here's another thing
that's true.

25:01.209 --> 25:03.420
We didn't actually need
a celebrity

25:03.461 --> 25:06.423
to sell Predator Power

25:06.464 --> 25:10.093
because these pills are
gonna help people.

25:10.135 --> 25:13.304
Let me tell you a story
about my father.

25:13.346 --> 25:17.058
When I was 12 years old,

25:17.100 --> 25:19.519
my father was taken from me

25:19.561 --> 25:23.356
by one of the deadliest
predators in the world:

25:23.398 --> 25:25.734
prostate cancer.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.277
- What the fuck?

25:27.318 --> 25:29.779
- I dedicated my life to
making sure

25:29.821 --> 25:33.783
no family would suffer like
mine did.

25:33.825 --> 25:37.328
I was determined to find a cure

25:37.370 --> 25:39.998
and I did.

25:40.040 --> 25:44.336
Because Predator Power pills
prevent prostate cancer

25:44.377 --> 25:47.130
in 75% of men.

25:47.172 --> 25:48.465
[applause]

25:48.506 --> 25:50.133
- Oh, hell yeah.

25:50.175 --> 25:53.178
- They are a fucking
magic bullet.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.804
We have studies.

25:54.846 --> 25:57.390
I shouldn't even be
telling you about it yet.

25:57.432 --> 26:00.477
But these studies will prove

26:00.518 --> 26:02.854
saw palmetto berries

26:02.896 --> 26:07.275
in Dominine's specific
patented formulation

26:07.317 --> 26:12.530
mixed with cancer eradicating
shark cartilage

26:12.572 --> 26:14.699
save lives.

26:14.741 --> 26:18.995
So I have a message for
prostate cancer:

26:19.037 --> 26:22.874
you can suck my dick.

26:22.916 --> 26:25.210
[cheers and applause]

26:25.251 --> 26:26.836
- Wow.
- Fucking love this guy.

26:26.878 --> 26:30.173
- There's a new apex predator
on planet Earth

26:30.215 --> 26:32.676
and if comes in
a fucking bottle.

26:32.717 --> 26:33.843
So place your orders now.

26:33.885 --> 26:39.182
* *

26:39.224 --> 26:41.685
- Fuck yeah, man!
I was getting calls from buyers

26:41.726 --> 26:43.269
while you're still up
on the stage.

26:43.311 --> 26:46.106
Hey, did your dad
really die of cancer?

26:46.147 --> 26:48.108
- No.
- I love it!

26:48.149 --> 26:49.651
You know,
you try and pretend like

26:49.693 --> 26:50.985
you're this cuddly teddy bear,

26:51.027 --> 26:52.696
but you're just
a big cave troll

26:52.737 --> 26:54.322
with piss running through
his veins.

26:54.364 --> 26:56.700
You're rehired.
- And Jillian?

26:56.741 --> 26:58.660
- Sure, yeah.
Just fix the accent.

26:58.702 --> 27:01.705
I got to take this.
Hey, CVS.

27:01.746 --> 27:03.832
Yeah, you dumb motherfuckers.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.208
Time to pay up.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.459
- What was that?

27:06.501 --> 27:08.044
- Rodney was gonna say
the cancer thing anyway.

27:08.086 --> 27:09.963
At least this saved our jobs.

27:10.005 --> 27:11.923
- But the stuff about
your dad...

27:11.965 --> 27:13.049
- I thought it'd be
more believable

27:13.091 --> 27:14.551
if I made it personal.
It's nothing.

27:14.592 --> 27:17.053
- I mean, the way dad
lived his life has effected

27:17.095 --> 27:19.514
every decision you've ever made
up until this point.

27:19.556 --> 27:21.850
But what the fuck do I know.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.435
- I'm sorry.

27:23.476 --> 27:26.354
But Camille is counting on me.
Nessa's counting on me.

27:26.396 --> 27:29.107
It doesn't mean I'm giving up
on our new farm.

27:29.149 --> 27:31.484
This was the only path forward.

27:31.526 --> 27:32.902
- I'm sure there were paths
that didn't include

27:32.944 --> 27:34.904
lying about curing cancer.

27:34.946 --> 27:38.575
- Preventing cancer.

27:38.616 --> 27:42.078
But I hate myself.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.415
This is gonna eat at me
forever.

27:45.457 --> 27:47.417
I don't know
how I'll sleep tonight.

27:47.459 --> 27:50.378
[snoring]

28:04.642 --> 28:06.644
Guess I'll see you back here
in a couple of hours.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.271
- Mm-hmm.
- Want to get breakfast?

28:08.313 --> 28:10.023
I got to grab my keys.
It'll only take a second.

28:10.065 --> 28:11.941
- I want to go home and shower.

28:11.983 --> 28:13.818
Thanks though.

28:16.279 --> 28:17.238
- All right.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.243
Jesus!

28:22.285 --> 28:24.162
What are you doing here?
- I got in early.

28:24.204 --> 28:26.247
That's the problem with
your generation.

28:26.289 --> 28:28.416
You don't understand hard work.

28:28.458 --> 28:31.169
- Okay, well,
I just came to grab one thing.

28:31.211 --> 28:32.629
Don't let me interrupt.

28:32.671 --> 28:35.131
- Do you know how bad you are
at running a business?

28:35.173 --> 28:37.967
Even after I fired
all those extra people,

28:38.009 --> 28:40.136
you're still bleeding cash.

28:40.178 --> 28:42.138
- What? You fired them.

28:42.180 --> 28:43.640
I told you the Boones
are important.

28:43.682 --> 28:44.974
You said you got it.

28:45.016 --> 28:46.309
I thought that meant
you got it.

28:46.351 --> 28:48.353
- What I got is that
you're an idiot

28:48.395 --> 28:51.523
who was in over his head.
You do illegal shit in cash.

28:51.564 --> 28:54.275
Don't put it on the books.
- Okay. [stammers]

28:54.317 --> 28:55.777
What did they say
when you fired them?

28:55.819 --> 28:57.487
Were they mad?

28:57.529 --> 28:59.155
- Well...

28:59.197 --> 29:02.325
[upbeat music playing]

29:02.367 --> 29:06.246
* *

29:06.287 --> 29:07.497
- [sighs]

29:07.539 --> 29:12.168
* *

29:12.210 --> 29:14.337
- Hey, there, Jillian.
- [gasps]

29:14.546 --> 29:16.381
- * You happy when it's sunny
on your birthday *

29:16.423 --> 29:18.341
* You sad when it's cloudy on
your birthday *

29:18.383 --> 29:20.301
* Baby girl, don't cry,
the sun is gonna shine *

29:20.343 --> 29:22.053
* You're gonna be happy on
your birthday *

29:22.095 --> 29:23.346
- * Yeah, I was born *
- I was born.

29:23.388 --> 29:26.224
- * I was born today
so light it up *

29:26.266 --> 29:29.060
- Light it up!
- * Like a candle today *

29:29.102 --> 29:31.187
* And I would die *
- I will die.

29:31.229 --> 29:32.981
- * If you take it away *

29:33.023 --> 29:37.360
* 'Cause it's gotta be
sunny on my birthday *

29:37.402 --> 29:40.071
- * All it takes for you to be
happy is just *

29:40.113 --> 29:41.531
* A little bit of sunshine *

29:41.573 --> 29:43.408
* Who needs all of this money,
honey *

29:43.450 --> 29:45.493
* When I can make you
all mine? *

29:45.535 --> 29:46.911
* Clouds ain't gonna rain *
- Nope.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.413
- * Won't wash all your
presents down the drain *

29:48.455 --> 29:49.622
- Hell, nah.

29:49.664 --> 29:51.249
- * You gotta be,
you wanna be *

29:51.291 --> 29:52.709
* It's gonna be sunny
on your birthday *

29:52.751 --> 29:54.377
- * Yeah, I was born *
- I was born.

29:54.419 --> 29:57.213
- * I was born today
so light it up *

29:57.255 --> 29:59.758
- Light it up!
- * Like a candle today *

29:59.799 --> 30:02.093
* And I would die *
- I will die.

30:02.135 --> 30:03.887
- * If you take it away *

30:03.928 --> 30:07.474
* 'Cause it's gotta be
sunny on my birthday *

30:07.515 --> 30:09.309
- Oh!

30:09.351 --> 30:10.727
- * Whoa *
- Yeah.

30:10.769 --> 30:13.396
- * Oh, oh, oh *
- [imitates gunshots]

30:13.438 --> 30:17.067
- * Whoa, oh, oh, oh *
- Yeah.

30:17.108 --> 30:18.777
- * Whoa *
- All right.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.403
- * Oh, oh *

30:20.445 --> 30:22.364
- Money, honey, money, honey,
money, honey.

30:22.405 --> 30:24.908
- * Oh, oh, oh *
- Uh!

30:24.949 --> 30:26.576
A Ryan Mildo original.

30:26.618 --> 30:28.870
Any similarities to
any artist out there

30:28.912 --> 30:31.623
is just pure coincidence.

30:31.664 --> 30:35.293
- * It's gotta be
sunny on my birthday *

30:35.335 --> 30:37.295
- It's all sunny, baby.

30:38.254 --> 30:40.298
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
