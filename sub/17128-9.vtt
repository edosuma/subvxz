MAN, THESE GUYS ARE EATING

11:17.778 --> 11:20.110
LIKE THEY NEVER HAD
A PIZZA BAGEL BEFORE.

11:22.012 --> 11:24.815
WHERE THE HELL IS OCTAVIO?

11:24.815 --> 11:26.917
HE RADIOED ME
THESE EXACT COORDINATES.

11:26.917 --> 11:28.688
HE SHOULD BE HERE.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.021
OH, MY GOD!
IT´S A COAST GUARD PLANE!

11:31.021 --> 11:33.023
THEY FOUND US!
GEORGE!

11:33.023 --> 11:36.326
DUDE, THAT´S A PELICAN!

11:36.326 --> 11:38.098
THIS IS CRAZY!

11:38.098 --> 11:40.200
WE CAN´T GO TO JAIL FOR A BUNCH
OF GUYS WE DON´T KNOW.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.972
I´M GONNA CALL THE COAST GUARD,

11:41.972 --> 11:43.874
TELL THEM WE RESCUED SOME
HAITIANS AND END THIS THING.

11:43.874 --> 11:46.907
AND WHAT IF OCTAVIO COMES
WHEN THE COAST GUARD IS HERE?

11:46.907 --> 11:48.909
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN TO HIM

11:48.909 --> 11:50.110
IF HE WAS SENT BACK TO CUBA?

11:50.110 --> 11:53.944
FINE.
WE´LL KEEP LOOKING.

11:53.944 --> 11:55.946
ERNIE, MAKES SURE THESE GUYS
STAY DOWN HERE.

11:55.946 --> 11:57.948
HEY, GEORGE, DON´T LEAVE ME.
WE´RE OUT OF FOOD.

11:57.948 --> 12:00.220
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
I DON´T CARE.

12:00.220 --> 12:04.124
BUTTER YOURSELF UP
AND PLAY KEEP-AWAY.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.833
OH, GREAT.
A "PARTY GIRL" T-SHIRT.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.204
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:14.204 --> 12:16.236
WHY DON´T YOU HELP YOURSELF
TO SOME PUNCH

12:16.236 --> 12:18.138
AND WHATEVER´S LEFT
OF THE COOKIE.

12:18.138 --> 12:21.241
MOM JUST CALLED.
SHE´S COMING HOME EARLY.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.243
WE GOTTA GET THEM
OUT OF HERE.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.375
BUT WE DIDN´T SING
OR DO THE CAKE.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.416
RIGHT.

12:26.416 --> 12:28.378
OKAY, KIDS.
GET OVER HERE.

12:28.378 --> 12:32.282
COME ON,
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT.

12:32.282 --> 12:36.086
NOW, FOR OUR SONG TODAY,
WE HAVE OUR OWN SPECIAL VERSION,

12:36.086 --> 12:38.358
AND I´M SURE
THAT YOU KIDS WILL LOVE IT.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.960
ALL RIGHT...

12:39.960 --> 12:41.291
♫ IT´S YOUR BIRTHDAY
HERE´S YOUR SONG ♫

12:41.291 --> 12:42.462
♫ NOW YOUR SONG IS OVER ♫

12:44.094 --> 12:46.196
WHOA! OH, MY GOODNESS,
FELL RIGHT ON THE GROUND.

12:46.196 --> 12:48.338
CAN´T EAT IT.
LET´S GO.

12:48.338 --> 12:50.770
WE NEVER
PLAYED ANY GAMES.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.173
OKAY. WE´RE GONNA PLAY A GAME
CALLED "CLOWN CAR."

12:53.173 --> 12:56.776
ALL YOU CLOWNS ARE GONNA
PILE INTO MY CAR, AND THEN
I´M GONNA TAKE YOU HOME.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.348
LET´S GO.

13:00.550 --> 13:02.552
HERE, YEAH, OKAY.

13:05.155 --> 13:09.159
HEY, I SEE
THE COASTLINE.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.423
I HAVE
FAILED OCTAVIO.

13:13.423 --> 13:15.325
VIC, WE HAD
TO COME BACK, MAN.

13:15.325 --> 13:16.997
WE WERE RUNNING OUT OF FUEL.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.468
COME ON,
WE HAD A GOOD DAY.

13:18.468 --> 13:22.472
WE GOT SOME SUN,
WE SAVED A FEW HAITIANS.

13:22.472 --> 13:26.136
YOU PUKED UP THOSE FIVE POUNDS
YOU WERE TRYING TO LOSE.

13:26.136 --> 13:30.010
MY BROTHER IS FLOATING
SOMEWHERE IN THE OCEAN,

13:30.010 --> 13:31.942
AND YOU MAKE THE FUNNIES.

13:31.942 --> 13:33.413
LOOK, MAN.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.385
MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE
PICKED HIM UP.

13:35.385 --> 13:37.948
I MEAN, WE TRIED, VIC.
WE DID OUR BEST.

13:37.948 --> 13:40.490
Ernie: HEY, CHECK IT OUT,
THERE´S ANOTHER BOAT OF HAITIANS

13:40.490 --> 13:43.823
AND THEY GOT A SIGN THAT SAYS,
"VIC PALMERO."

13:46.857 --> 13:50.100
Vic: THAT LOOKS
LIKE OCTAVIO.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.831
CUT THE ENGINE, ERNIE.

13:51.831 --> 13:56.867
Vic: MI HERMANO!
MI HERMANO!

13:58.568 --> 14:01.371
OCTAVIO!
MI HERMANO!

14:01.371 --> 14:04.374
VICTOR!
OCTAVIO!

14:04.374 --> 14:07.347
I HAVE WAITED A LONG TIME
FOR THIS MOMENT.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.550
YOUR KISSES
SMELL LIKE VOMIT!

14:12.852 --> 14:14.424
I DIDN´T SEE --

14:14.424 --> 14:16.426
I DIDN´T SEE YOU
AT THE MEETING POINT,

14:16.426 --> 14:18.288
SO I WENT FOR LAND.

14:18.288 --> 14:21.491
IT DOESN´T MATTER NOW.
WE ARE TOGETHER.

14:21.491 --> 14:24.164
THIS IS GEORGE,
ANGIE´S HUSBAND.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.997
THE ONE WHO KEPT HER
FROM COLLEGE?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.571
OCTAVIO,
WELCOME TO AMERICA,

14:31.571 --> 14:34.044
THE LAND OF THE FREE
AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE.

14:34.044 --> 14:36.907
YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO FEAR
AN OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT.

14:36.907 --> 14:39.049
Man: [ On bullhorn ]
THIS IS THE COAST GUARD.

14:39.049 --> 14:41.451
ANCHOR YOUR VESSEL.

14:41.451 --> 14:44.514
SWIM!
SWIM FOR YOUR LIVES!

14:44.514 --> 14:47.457
SWIM!

14:47.457 --> 14:50.320
GIVE THE HAITIANS
A HEAD START!

14:56.196 --> 14:58.628
HEY.
IS YOUR MOM HOME YET?

14:58.628 --> 15:00.030
NOPE.
GOOD.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.331
WHERE ARE YOUR PRESENTS?

15:01.331 --> 15:04.004
HIDDEN UNDER MY BED,
JUST LIKE YOU TOLD ME.

15:05.475 --> 15:08.238
HEY, GUYS.

15:08.238 --> 15:11.381
MAX, I KNOW
YOU WERE DISAPPOINTED

15:11.381 --> 15:15.045
YOU COULDN´T GET
THAT NEW VIDEO GAME YOU WANTED,

15:15.045 --> 15:19.449
SO I PICKED YOU UP
A LITTLE SURPRISE.

15:19.449 --> 15:22.252
A PUZZLE.

15:22.252 --> 15:23.623
A POLAR BEAR PUZZLE.

15:26.096 --> 15:28.328
ICEBERG --
ALL THOSE WHITE PIECES

15:28.328 --> 15:30.630
ARE SURE GONNA BE
A BIG CHALLENGE.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.963
SORRY I´M LATE.

15:32.963 --> 15:35.265
I WENT TO ANOTHER BIRTHDAY PARTY
WITH MY SISTER.

15:35.265 --> 15:37.507
MY SOCIAL LIFE IS ON FIRE.

15:39.269 --> 15:42.412
HERE. I GOT YOU ROACH TRAPS
AND FLIP FLOPS.

15:43.513 --> 15:46.316
MAX, WHAT´S HE
TALKING ABOUT?

15:46.316 --> 15:48.318
GRANDMA THREW ME
A BIRTHDAY PARTY

15:48.318 --> 15:50.150
SO I COULD GET PRESENTS.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.123
MAX!

15:53.123 --> 15:56.686
YOU FAKED YOUR BIRTHDAY?

15:56.686 --> 15:59.329
AND YOU ARRANGED IT?

15:59.329 --> 16:02.262
ANGIE, I SWEAR
ON MY SON´S LIFE --

16:02.262 --> 16:05.365
I GOT HERE LATE,
I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS GOING ON.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.368
I AM AS SHOCKED AS YOU.

16:08.368 --> 16:13.173
BENNY, I COUNTED ON YOU.
THERE HAS TO BE AN ADULT HERE.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.546
ABSOLUTELY.
NEXT TIME.

16:16.546 --> 16:18.508
YOU ARE GROUNDED!

16:18.508 --> 16:21.051
AND YOU´RE GONNA
RETURN ALL THE GIFTS YOU GOT.
MOM --

16:21.051 --> 16:22.752
THAT´S NOT ALL.

16:22.752 --> 16:25.655
YOU´RE GONNA GIVE EACH OF THESE
KIDS A TOY OF YOURS IN RETURN.

16:25.655 --> 16:28.588
NOW, BEFORE I TAKE HIM HOME,
APOLOGIZE.

16:28.588 --> 16:33.993
I´M SORRY, DAVE.
HERE´S ONE OF MY TOYS.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.596
NOW, WHY AM I BEING
PUNISHED?

16:52.742 --> 16:59.018
OYE, CHICA, SAY HELLO
TO YOUR LITTLE FRIEND.

16:59.389 --> 17:01.151
HOW WAS THE TRIP?
GREAT.

17:01.151 --> 17:03.523
AND I PICKED UP
A LITTLE ANNIVERSARY PRESENT

17:03.523 --> 17:06.196
OUTSIDE OF MIAMI.

17:06.196 --> 17:08.498
YOU WEREN´T SUPPOSED TO SPEND
ANY MONEY.

17:08.498 --> 17:09.529
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.331
I -- WHAT?
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.732
OKAY.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.235
KEEP THEM CLOSED.
ALL RIGHT.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.342
George:
OKAY. OPEN THEM.

17:24.544 --> 17:29.519
MY LITTLE ANGIE, LOOK AT YOU,
ALL GROWN UP.

17:29.519 --> 17:32.152
MY GOD, UNCLE OCTAVIO.

17:32.152 --> 17:35.585
ANGIE, CASTRO WASN´T GOING TO
LET HIM LEAVE CUBA.

17:35.585 --> 17:37.627
I LOST ALL HOPE OF COMING.

17:37.627 --> 17:39.559
BUT THIS BRAVE MAN
AND YOUR FATHER

17:39.559 --> 17:41.491
WENT INTO THE OCEAN
TO GET ME.

17:41.491 --> 17:43.263
THEY WERE A LITTLE LATE

17:43.263 --> 17:45.595
AND WE HAD TO OUTRUN
THE COAST GUARD.

17:45.595 --> 17:48.498
YOU´RE KILLING
THE MOMENT.

17:48.498 --> 17:51.401
OH, MY GOD, GEORGE,
THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING THING

17:51.401 --> 17:53.673
ANYONE´S EVER DONE FOR ME.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.275
Vic:
COME ON, OCTAVIO.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.647
LET´S TAKE YOUR STUFF
UPSTAIRS.

17:57.647 --> 18:00.410
TOMORROW, WE´LL GO
TO A SUPERMARKET,

18:00.410 --> 18:04.684
AND I´LL SHOW YOU PEANUT BUTTER
AND JELLY IN THE SAME JAR.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.187
WHAT IS PEANUT BUTTER?

18:07.187 --> 18:10.420
WHAT IS TOOTHPASTE
THAT WHITENS AND BRIGHTENS?

18:10.420 --> 18:15.165
WHAT IS HOT DOG
WITH CHEESE ALREADY INSIDE IT?

18:15.165 --> 18:20.200
THAT, MI HERMANO,
IS THE SWEET TASTE OF FREEDOM.

18:25.705 --> 18:29.339
I´M BLOWN AWAY.
I DON´T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

18:29.339 --> 18:30.880
DON´T SAY ANYTHING.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.643
I´M SURE YOU GOT ME SOMETHING
JUST AS SPECIAL.

18:41.851 --> 18:43.653
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

18:43.653 --> 18:46.125
WHAT´S THIS?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.728
I MADE YOU A MIX TAPE
FROM THE YEAR WE MET.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.761
SO I FLEW
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

18:51.761 --> 18:54.734
RISKED MY LIFE
ON THE OCEAN,

18:54.734 --> 18:56.706
AND YOU GIVE ME
A TAPE WITH...

18:56.706 --> 19:01.211
"WAKE ME UP
BEFORE YOU GO-GO"?

19:01.211 --> 19:04.344
I´M SORRY.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.675
I LOVE IT.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.421
HERE´S YOUR REAL GIFT.

19:11.421 --> 19:13.453
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, BABY.

19:21.591 --> 19:23.463
WHAT IS THIS?

19:23.463 --> 19:25.295
I MADE IT.

19:27.497 --> 19:29.239
WHAT ABOUT OCTAVIO?

19:29.239 --> 19:33.273
OH, ANGIE, HE´S FAMILY.
I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT ANYWAY.

19:33.273 --> 19:36.306
OH, GEORGE.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.610
I LOVE IT.

19:40.610 --> 19:43.713
IT´S LOPSIDED...

19:43.713 --> 19:45.685
IT´S DENTED.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.717
IT LOOKS LIKE
A 3-YEAR-OLD DID IT.

19:49.289 --> 19:53.963
I LOVE THAT IT CAME
FROM YOUR HEART.

19:53.963 --> 19:57.196
IT SUCKS, BUT IT´S STILL
BETTER THAN A MIX TAPE.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.928
HEY!

20:03.273 --> 20:06.706
YOU KNOW,
IF CASTRO WERE HERE RIGHT NOW,

20:06.706 --> 20:08.678
I WOULD TAKE
AN OLD RUSTY RAZOR,

20:08.678 --> 20:12.742
SHAVE THAT BEARD OFF AND POUR
VINEGAR ALL OVER HIS FACE.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.684
OOH, THE STINGING.

20:14.684 --> 20:18.588
IF CASTRO WERE HERE
RIGHT NOW,

20:18.588 --> 20:22.592
I WOULD TRAIN A PACK OF DOGS
JUST TO ATTACK CIGARS.

20:22.592 --> 20:26.826
THEN WHEN HE STARTED SMOKING,
THEY WOULD DESTROY HIS FACE.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.829
IF HE WERE HERE RIGHT NOW,

20:29.829 --> 20:32.532
I WOULD RIP HIS HEAD OFF
WITH MY BARE HANDS

20:32.532 --> 20:33.833
AND PUT IT ON BACKWARDS,

20:33.833 --> 20:36.636
SO THAT HE WOULD HAVE
TO LOOK AT HIS OWN BUTT

20:36.636 --> 20:38.368
WHILE I KICKED IT.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.572
IT´S GO TIME!
