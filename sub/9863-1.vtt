I take the orders.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.330
The girls get someone
on the outside

34:31.330 --> 34:34.699
To send a money order
to your p.O. Box.

34:34.699 --> 34:36.739
You just deposit the money
into a bank account,

34:36.739 --> 34:39.300
Then you go to
one of those chain drugstores.

34:39.310 --> 34:40.770
They're gonna have
everything on the list.

34:40.770 --> 34:43.739
You buy it and you ship it
to a different p.O. Box,

34:43.739 --> 34:45.280
All legal.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.409
Sarah, this is gonna
mess with your appeal.

34:47.409 --> 34:49.280
This is gonna pay
for my appeal.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.580
Don't worry.

34:50.580 --> 34:51.820
I love you

You were wrong, mr. Cook.

36:04.790 --> 36:06.930
It only took them one year
to review my case.

36:06.930 --> 36:08.660
When's my retrial?

36:08.660 --> 36:11.530
Your motion was denied.

36:11.530 --> 36:13.830
What?

36:13.830 --> 36:15.670
But rick's affidavit

36:15.670 --> 36:18.800
The judge has denied
your request for a retrial

36:18.810 --> 36:21.810
Based on the other undisputed
evidence against you-

36:21.810 --> 36:24.210
The shotgun you purchased,

36:24.210 --> 36:25.610
The truck you borrowed,

36:25.610 --> 36:27.810
Forensic evidence
at your house.

36:27.810 --> 36:30.650
You're not
getting out, sarah.

36:30.650 --> 36:32.180
I'm sorry.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.290
You're sorry?

36:34.290 --> 36:36.690
I've paid you
thousands of dollars!

36:36.690 --> 36:40.460
People have made sacrifices
for me! No! No!

This monumental
disappointment

37:31.810 --> 37:32.810
Change
your attitude.

37:32.810 --> 37:35.010
No, ma'am.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.510
I'm not sure you realize

37:36.520 --> 37:38.580
What a positive role model
you've become.

37:39.990 --> 37:41.490
Thank you, ma'am.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.590
I'm gonna bring
my girls to meet you.

37:43.590 --> 37:44.990
No. No, farrell.

37:44.990 --> 37:46.590
You need to
forget about me,

37:46.590 --> 37:47.760
You need to
forget this place,

And focus on staying

38:03.040 --> 38:05.440
Oh, they're beautiful.

for getting my kids back?

38:29.940 --> 38:31.970
Don't lose them again.

38:31.970 --> 38:33.540
They need you.

38:35.740 --> 38:37.540

criminals or something.

39:23.660 --> 39:26.360
That mean we have to
ask permission to pee?

39:26.360 --> 39:27.990
Hell, they're already
all up in our business.

There won't be

talking about?

39:34.130 --> 39:35.530
While you were
in the lock,

39:35.540 --> 39:37.470
We got ourselves a new
prison commissioner.

39:37.470 --> 39:38.800
A real hard-ass.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.970
He's adding "movement
accountability" protocols--

39:41.980 --> 39:43.140
Cameras everywhere,

39:43.140 --> 39:45.640
I.D. Badges, more rules.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.410
Shoot. We aren't
in our cells or at chow,

39:48.420 --> 39:50.620
We gotta present
special passes.

bein' "the man."

39:54.890 --> 39:56.720
Next week.

39:59.930 --> 40:02.860
I only got
about 10 minutes.

40:02.860 --> 40:05.430
Gonna tell me about
the new security?

40:06.930 --> 40:08.600
I was.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.840
I'm sorry.
I'm disappointed, too.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.570
You're disappointed?

40:12.570 --> 40:14.940
We missed our chance.

40:14.940 --> 40:16.170
The window's gonna close.

40:16.180 --> 40:18.040
You've just gotta
file another appeal.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.510
There are
no more appeals!

40:20.510 --> 40:21.910
[sighing]

40:21.920 --> 40:24.520
Look, we talked about
what was gonna happen

40:24.520 --> 40:25.950
If I lost my appeal.

40:25.950 --> 40:27.550
It's too late.

you've never met

I checked.

40:48.610 --> 40:50.510
It leads to the release area.

40:50.510 --> 40:52.810
From there, I've got
everything figured out.

But spitler
was in a hurry.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.410
He's a model guard.

48:41.410 --> 48:43.980
He ain't perfect, ms. Rogers.

48:45.020 --> 48:45.980
There've been rumors.

48:45.990 --> 48:48.320
What kind of rumors?

48:49.320 --> 48:51.920
Soap and water
weren't the only fluids

48:51.930 --> 48:53.960
They've been mixing
in the chemical closet.

48:56.090 --> 48:58.100
This is bull!

48:58.100 --> 48:59.600
I'm the straightest arrow here.

48:59.600 --> 49:00.930
Why did you rush
the van inspection

49:00.930 --> 49:02.470
When you exited
after refueling?

49:02.470 --> 49:03.530
Check your records,
marshal.

49:03.540 --> 49:05.470
Since I've been
a trip officer,

49:05.470 --> 49:07.470
I've never skipped
van inspection.

49:07.470 --> 49:09.340
I get it.

You're not the kind of
guy who flaunts rules.

49:12.580 --> 49:15.710
Let's talk about
the chemical closet.

49:15.720 --> 49:18.620

knew sarah pender,

49:18.620 --> 49:20.180
But according
to prison records,

49:20.190 --> 49:22.090
You were her supervisor

49:22.090 --> 49:24.360
When she was
on chemical duty.

49:24.360 --> 49:27.090
I supervised a lot of women
on chemical duty.

49:28.960 --> 49:31.000
I did not do anything wrong
with that woman.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.360
She had help
on the inside, scott.

49:33.370 --> 49:35.100
We have to ask everyone.

49:35.100 --> 49:38.200
I know.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.000
So, officer spitler.

49:40.010 --> 49:42.970
You didn't do anything
wrong with that woman?

49:42.980 --> 49:45.240
No. I did not.

49:45.240 --> 49:48.280
Did you know,
when people lie,

49:48.280 --> 49:49.650
They don't use
contractions?

49:49.650 --> 49:53.350
And they use distancing phrases
like "that woman"

49:53.350 --> 49:55.720
When they really meant
"monica lewinski."

49:57.220 --> 49:59.490
You're lying.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.170

50:10.740 --> 50:12.670
Is this true?

50:14.270 --> 50:16.110
What the hell
were you thinking?

50:17.280 --> 50:19.140
I don't know.

50:19.150 --> 50:22.150
I was...

50:22.150 --> 50:23.480
It just made sense.

50:25.450 --> 50:28.320
Sarah, she understood me.

50:28.320 --> 50:30.020
She...

50:30.020 --> 50:31.690
Loved me.

50:31.690 --> 50:34.190
She wanted to have my baby.

50:34.190 --> 50:36.130
Where is she?

50:36.130 --> 50:38.200
I don't know.

50:38.200 --> 50:40.630
I swear.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.040
Sarah didn't tell me anything.

50:46.070 --> 50:47.340
My job

50:47.340 --> 50:49.140
Was just to get her
to the parking lot.

50:51.810 --> 50:53.140
[answering machine beeps]

50:53.150 --> 50:54.580
Daddy. I'm out.

50:54.580 --> 50:56.280
Please don't be mad at me.

50:56.280 --> 50:59.650
I tried it their way,
but they gave me no choice.

50:59.650 --> 51:01.190
I'll be in touch

That'll be

51:31.680 --> 51:33.580
I want to speak to her.

this was gonna end bad.

51:35.790 --> 51:37.720
Said the fat man
in the hot tub.

51:37.720 --> 51:40.090
Ah, shut it.

51:40.090 --> 51:41.790
She's gonna kill me.

Open the door!

51:56.140 --> 51:58.440
How can I help you?

51:59.380 --> 52:01.650
I'm looking for sarah pender.

52:01.650 --> 52:03.750
Well, have you tried
rockville prison?

52:03.750 --> 52:06.420
[snickers dryly]
is anyone else in the house?

52:06.420 --> 52:09.220
Oh. Yeah. Uh, ben's...

52:09.220 --> 52:11.390
Out back in the jacuzzi.

52:11.390 --> 52:13.420
But you don't want to
see that.

52:13.430 --> 52:16.730
You're not curious
why I'm looking for her?

52:16.730 --> 52:19.430
Oh, I guess
that she's probably missing.

52:19.430 --> 52:20.660
Good guess.

52:20.670 --> 52:22.770
The guard
that helped pender escape

52:22.770 --> 52:24.540
Said you drove
the getaway car.

52:24.540 --> 52:25.640
He didn't see me.

52:25.640 --> 52:29.370
No, he didn't. I lied.

52:29.380 --> 52:30.810
Jamie, where is she?

52:30.810 --> 52:33.840
Sarah didn't kill
those people!

52:33.850 --> 52:36.610
She's a fugitive now,
with a target on her back.

52:36.620 --> 52:38.180
But I can bring her in alive.

52:38.180 --> 52:40.150
You don't give a rat's ass about
sarah.

52:40.150 --> 52:43.890
She's got nothing to lose.
You have everything.

52:43.890 --> 52:46.490
Aiding and abetting
an escaped prisoner is a felony.

52:46.490 --> 52:47.790
You've already done the crime.

52:47.790 --> 52:50.560
You can't help her
anymore.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.330
You can only
help yourself.

52:52.330 --> 52:54.400
Jamie!

52:54.400 --> 52:56.230
You tell the man

They've already arrested

Things aren't going

She's the most beautiful,

they were in love, too.

56:25.640 --> 56:26.640
That's bull.

She hated that man.

56:28.010 --> 56:29.810
He was screwing other girls
before sarah.

56:29.820 --> 56:31.680
That's why
she picked him...

She didn't trust you.

anything was possible.

I never had to
pretend with her.

Sarah was very popular

And you must be bob.

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:22.910
It was 400, right?

Hope you're not in a hurry.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.320
How long
you been married?

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:43.160
35 years...
To life.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.400
When did you
get divorced?

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.170
We're still
married, actually.

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.970
He's a cop.

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:53.100
We used to be
crazy in love,

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:57.210
Then he just started
going psycho with jealousy.

01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:58.310
Thought I was flirting
with everyone,

01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:01.210
He hit me a few times.

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:03.380

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.240
There are cops

They must know I helped you.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.270
No, no, no.
They're just fishing.

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:31.040
Half the girls at rockville
have stripped there.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.380
Just drive away.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.510
You know I'll never tell
anyone you helped me.

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:34.980
You can't come back
to my place.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.510
I won't.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.120
Just take care of your girls.
I'll figure something out, okay?

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.080
Good luck.

Consider yourself home, baby.

Can I take a bath?

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:11.980
I haven't soaked in a tub
for years.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:13.450
Soak away.

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:15.850

I came to indianapolis
to track down sarah pender.

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:41.510
Pender's a convicted killer

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:44.820
Who's been on the run
for 72 hours now,

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.950
And there's no telling
what she's capable of next,

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:53.020
So if you've seen sarah pender,
call us at 1-800-crime-tv.

She needs to be
back behind bars tonight.

Just let me go.
You can keep your money.

called the cops

Right afterwards.

I should've told them

But I did more than
enough time

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.440
For that one mistake,

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.400

And after that?

If you really want
to help me,

Help me get a job...

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.510
A good job
that pays cash.

01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:20.680

be thinking about

leave the country?

01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:24.010
They'll be
expecting me to run.

anyone expects me to do.

01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:32.960
Accounting.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.190
Second-oldest profession.

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:35.960
In high school, I did
the books and payroll

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.390
For my father's
landscaping business.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.500

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.530

01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:43.070
Distribution.
I own hopner supplies.

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:46.200
So that's like, what?
Napkins, cups, plates?

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.340
Very good.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.040
That's cool.

You really are
something else.

Most women don't care
about what I do.

01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:59.380
It's not a very
sexy business.

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:01.250
But it's made me rich.

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:03.250
Which is sexy.

She's my wife's cousin,

But she's in
a little bit of a situation.

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:14.660
She knows accounting.

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.270
Okay, I'll start
the paperwork.

01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:19.340
Well, I'd rather
keep it off the books for now,

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.410
So just pay her 10 bucks an hour
out of petty cash.

01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:24.110

start tomorrow.

anything to anyone.

I did it
because I wanted to do it, okay?

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:53.640
I loved her enough
to let her go.

I'm sleeping with
america's most wanted woman.

She is a convicted murderer.
She knows how to use people.

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.740
She gets ordinary people
to do horrible things,

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.480
And then she flushes them
down the toilet,

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.420
Just like she flushed
those two bodies

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.350

I'm ordinary, baby?

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:46.420
You're not
that special.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:47.460
Oh, really?

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.630

Bringing in pender

And one he takes
very personally.

You're gonna make a mistake.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.500
When you do,

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.070

50% of
your payroll tax remittance

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.319
Is money withheld
from employee pay,

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:54.520
Which are wage expenses,
not payroll.

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:57.189
Jerry's been writing them off
as payroll expenses.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.160
Crap.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.330
Don't worry, honey.

01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:00.500
I showed jerry
his mistake.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.200
As long as you pay
the back taxes,

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.569
You won't be audited.

It could cause me
a lot of problems.

Hey. Why do we have to
upset this special thing, huh?

But I'm a hunted woman,

And you're aiding and abetting
a fugitive.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.890
It would be in
both of our interests

01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:27.520
To get a plan together,

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:28.930
A long-term plan,

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.690
Maybe... Maybe we should
give her a call.

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:03.630
Why don't we?

01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:05.900
As a member of the board,

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.500
I'm sure
she'd be interested to learn

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.800
How you've been
ripping this company off blind.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.800
And I'm not talking
your incompetence,

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.940
I'm talking straight-up
embezzlement.

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.440
Imagine my surprise

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.540
When I called that glue vendor
up in fort wayne

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.240
About a check
that never cleared,

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.310
Found out they've been
out of business for three years.

01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:25.680
Any idea who's been
forging their signature?

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.950
Or where
that 38-grand went to?

01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:30.650
So what do you think, jerry?

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:33.420
Should we call?

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:35.990
[♪]

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.930
I wasn't gonna
call the police, but...

01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:44.500
When I saw
america's most wanted...

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.500
[sighs]:
I don't want her to get hurt.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.270
I can't imagine
how difficult this must be

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:50.510
For you as a father.

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:52.810
She was only three
when her mom left,

01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:54.680
Just took off.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.680
I went and got her,

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.450
Brought her here
and raised her.

01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:02.250
I guess I probably spoiled her.

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:05.020
She got me
to do whatever she wanted.

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:09.290
She never liked
the word, "no."

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:13.630
I just... I just wanted her
to feel loved.

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:15.800
She always wanted more.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.900
[sighs]

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:21.340
Is sarah capable

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:24.440
Of doing the things
she was convicted of?

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:31.310
When it comes to surviving...

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:38.050
My daughter is capable of
doing anything.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.660

Daddy?

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.090
Who is this?

01:12:13.090 --> 01:12:15.090
U.S. Marshal harlan.

01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:16.860
Don't hang up.

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.560
How did you get this phone?

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.530
Your dad.

01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:21.530
He has nothing
to do with this.

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:22.970
You dragged him into it
when you sent him the phone.

01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:24.370
That's why he called me.

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:25.970
-He called you?
-Yeah.

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:27.500
Real nice man.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.010
Leave my father alone!

01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:30.410
You're killing him, sarah.

01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:32.510
Shut up! Shut up.

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:34.980
Tell me where you are.

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:38.450
I'll bring you in.
Do it for your father.

01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:40.020
Must be frustrating,
marshal harlan.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.480
You got pretty close to me

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.120
At that motel,
but ever since then,

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:47.460
[sighs] whoever's helping you,
they know you're a killer.

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.660
I'm not a killer!

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:49.930
So your two roommates
shot themselves?

01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:51.490
Rick is an idiot!
If I wanted to kill someone,

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.960
I wouldn't have shot them
in my living room

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.730
And dumped their bodies
around the corner.

01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:55.870
Then why didn't you
call the cops?

01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:58.530
I just saw my boyfriend
kill drew.

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.140
Yeah. That would scare anyone.

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.570
I get it.

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.070
You saw your boyfriend
shoot drew,

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.610
Then you saw him shoot--

01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:07.910
What was her name?

01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:09.880
I didn't see rick shoot trish. I
wasn't there.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.880
You just said--

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.880
[snap]

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:14.450
[fuming]

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:15.890
They got a weak hit

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:17.720
On two towers off I-80,
between gary and toledo.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.060
She's been in
the midwest

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:19.990
The whole time.

01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:21.690
Get on it.

01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:23.060
Pender just let it slip that
she saw her boyfriend kill drew.

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:24.690
She's always claimed

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.630
She wasn't in the house
when the killings occurred.

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:26.860
Well, does it really matter?

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:29.600
It's the first slip-up
she's made.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.100
When she does it again,
I'm gonna be there.

01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.460
Where have you been?
I've been calling you all night.

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.800
-Hey, what's wrong?
-Everything!

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.800
That u.S. Marshal's
gotten to my dad.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.670
Jerry knows
I'm not your cousin.

01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:04.800
I'll handle jerry.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.100
All this hiding
and pretending.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:08.570
I need to find

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:10.210
Someone who can commit
to a future with me.

01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:12.440
Listen. I'm that guy.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.540
Okay?

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:15.010
We'll start over.

01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:16.910
I'm gonna make you happy, sarah.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.080
I promise.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.580
[bob]: Wait.

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:21.920
[sarah]: Where are we?

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.890
Keep them closed.

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:23.890
Okay...

01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:25.020
Okay.
You can open 'em.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.230
You like?

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:30.960
I rented it for you.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.090
For us.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.060
This is amazing.

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.900
I love it.

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.000
I love you.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:42.840
You want to go upstairs?

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.740
I... I can't.

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:47.010
Betty's expecting me
for dinner.

01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:48.640
[groans quietly]

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:51.250
We've got to start
implementing our plan, bob.

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:52.650
You can't have
everything you want.

01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:53.780
You've got to make choices.

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:56.090
Sarah, I can't
marry a fugitive.

01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:58.250
You can't marry anyone
until you get a divorce.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.920
Divorces are complicated.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.790
Betty could take me
for millions.

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:06.030
Maybe there's
a simpler solution.

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:10.830
I know what I want.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.200
And I want to be
the next mrs. Robert hopner,

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.170
But I'm not gonna wait forever
for you to decide.

[inhales and sighs]
sorry, marshal.

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:29.150
I have no idea where she'd go.

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:30.650
After three months on the run,

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.760
I'm not holding my breath
for a call, either.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.590
She's been out
four months.

01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:37.630
133 days,
but who's counting?

01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:40.200
The only time sarah
ever communicated with me

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.560
Since we were arrested

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:44.930
Was when she needed
an affidavit.

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:48.800
She blames that forged letter
in getting her 110 years.

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:51.310
I was just trying to
save my own ass from the needle.

01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:53.040
The prosecution
used it

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.640
To turn sarah
into the boogeyman.

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:57.080
Otherwise, she might've
gotten away with it.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.580
Gotten away with what?

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:05.620
Her role in it.

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:09.890
Ease up.

01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:11.990
Those things'll
kill you.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.300
Not soon enough.

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.870
[takes a tense breath]

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:19.140
You know, I was happy
with what we had...

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.800
But sarah always wanted more.

01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:23.210
Fancy cars? Jewelry?

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:25.210
[snorts]
sarah? You kidding?

01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:28.180
Nah, she wanted a family.

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.980
A big family.

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.850
Six or seven kids.

01:16:32.850 --> 01:16:34.650
It was all about the kids
for her.

01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:36.150
She wanted to give them

01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:38.050
The childhood
she didn't get to have.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.890
Doesn't fit the picture
of sarah in your mind?

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:47.160
Guard.

01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:58.940
So a.M.W. 's going to lead
with a pender update.

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.310
What's up?

01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:01.640
Call rockville.

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:03.250
Find out if anyone
in pender's orbit

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.680
Had three daughters.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.180
These kids
are very important to her.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:09.190
Who are they?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.200

Hi.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.160
So I talked to
a plastic surgeon

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:23.370
Today, in new york.

01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:25.130
He can do everything
for about 13 grand--

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.400
Nose, cheek-lifts, chin.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:29.170
A whole new me,
in eight hours.

01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:30.810
Great.

01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:32.740
We could stay a few extra days.

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:35.080
We can make
a little honeymoon out of it.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.780
I can't wait to have
a normal life with you.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:41.250
Me too.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.760
A stripper.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.760
She did a nine-month bid
for solicitation.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.900
Sarah helped her
keep her kids.

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.230
I don't remember the name.

01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:58.300
She's not on sarah's call
or visitation list,

01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.370
So we missed her.

01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:03.070
Oh! Look at

U.S. Marshal sean harlan.

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:32.800
I'm looking for
sarah pender.

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.200
I... I don't have any idea.

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:37.770
I know she helped you
keep custody of your kids.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:39.710
It'd be a shame
to lose them now.

01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:42.950
To you,
I'm just some ex-con stripper,

01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:45.820
But to my girls,
I'm mom,

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.380
And I owe that to sarah.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:48.920
She dragged you
into this,

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.750
And she's putting you
and your kids at risk.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.350
She was desperate.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.760
Tell me where she is,

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.030
And I'll keep you out of this,
I promise.

01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:58.430
Your parole officer
never has to know.

01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:01.160
Do it for
your daughters.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.300
[sighs tensely]

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.370

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:10.370

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.820
[♪]

01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:31.260
When did you
get home?

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:33.830
Dinner won't be ready
for awhile yet.

01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:37.300
Opened one of those
napa pinots you like.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.540
What's the occasion?

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:44.170
We didn't used to need one.

01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:05.830
Bob hopner, right?

01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:08.060
Yeah. Hey.

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.800
Hey, I know you.
How do I know you?

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.200
Well, maybe
you saw me on tv.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.840
America's
most wanted?

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.300
Sean harlan.
U.S. Marshals.

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.270
Fugitive recovery
task force.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.110
Right.

01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:19.310
Where is she, bob?

01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:22.240
Who? I... I don't
know what you mean.

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:25.410
I can handcuff you right now
and take you inside

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.920
And do this
in front of your wife.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.250
My wife's not home.

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:30.320
But that's betty's car
right there.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.390
I ran
the registration.

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:35.120
So, should we
include mrs. Hopner

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.430
In this conversation?

01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:38.360
Okay. Look.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.500
I spent one night
with sarah

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:43.970
A few months ago.

01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:45.940
Okay?

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.340
Look, I'm out
on the road a lot.

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:50.070
I sometimes like to
party with women.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.170
I mean, that was it.

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:53.880
It was a few months ago,

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.040
And I haven't
seen her since.

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:56.210
She didn't tell you
who she was,

01:20:56.210 --> 01:20:57.480
Or what she'd done?

01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.550
No.

01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:00.550
No, I mean,
I didn't realize,

01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:03.020
Until I saw her face
on that most wanted show.

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:04.290
Why didn't you call the show?

01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:05.420
You could've collected
the reward.

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.960
Yeah. Uh...

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.590
I'm not sure how I would have
explained that one to the wife.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.490
Right.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:17.200
Most people who come
into contact with sarah pender

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.230
And up dead
or in jail.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.240
Well, I make
my own luck, marshal.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.570
Thanks for your time, bob.

01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:26.240
[♪]

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.240
The arrogant jackass.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.580
He knows where pender is.

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.380
That's why I'm gonna let him
lead us to her.

01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:33.020
How many cell lines
does he have?

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.220
He's got three.

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:35.250
The first one
seems strictly business,

01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:37.120
Mainly 9:00-to-5:00,

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.420
But the third one
never calls

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.460
His home line
or his wife's cell.

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:42.220
Lots of calls to muncie,
up until a month ago.

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:44.490
The recent activity is
all in the chicago area.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.100
I'm going to chicago.

01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:48.200
Stay up on all his lines.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.570
[♪]

01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:54.940
Hey.

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.670
You're on tv, right?

01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:59.310
One of them
reality shows?

01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:01.480
No. Sorry.

01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:06.180
[♪]

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:10.650
Baby... You know how much
I love you, don't you?

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.150
I know this hasn't been easy,

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.420
But we're gonna finally
be happy together.

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:17.260
I'm going to go get packed.
I'll see you tonight.

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.300
Just call me
when you're on the way.

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:22.160
[mccorkle]: The carrier
needs to see a warrant first.

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.430
Mccorkle,
we've got a warrant!

01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:26.700
Fax it to them,
get me the damn number.

01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:33.580
On my personal top 10 fugitive
list of the year

01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:37.680
Currently the only woman
on that list.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.450
Pender's a double-murderer

01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:42.020
Who broke out of
rockville prison in indiana

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.990
Several months ago.

01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:47.320
[phone rings]

01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:50.030

01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:52.460
[silence]

01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:58.200
Get it?

01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.400
[mccorkle]: Got it.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.340
On clybourn
and fullerton.

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:02.710
Puts her about

01:23:02.710 --> 01:23:04.410
Five miles southwest
of downtown chicago.

01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:05.740
Slip-up number two.
Where do I go?

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:07.380
Take ashland north.

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:10.480
Maybe I can put you
on a specific street.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.120
Gas company.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.290
We need to do
a meter-reading.

01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:26.400
Sarah jo pender?

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.500
You got me.

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:32.170
Hands on your head.
Turn around.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.010
Where's marshal harlan?

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.770
Who?

01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:42.310
[radios crackling,
quiet chatter]

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:52.420
[sean]: U.S. Marshal.
Where is she?

01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:53.620
[officer]:
We're upstairs, sir.

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.130
Marshal harlan.

01:23:58.130 --> 01:24:01.200
Too bad you didn't
catch me.

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:06.100
Sometimes...
It takes a village.

[tv reporter]:
Acting on an anonymous tip,

U.S. Marshal
top 15 fugitive sarah pender,

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:20.680
In a rented townhouse

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.590
On the southwest side
of the city.

01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:26.360
The tipster,
who wouldn't leave a name,

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.090
From an episode
of america's most wanted,

01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:31.760
Which aired earlier tonight.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.560
Pender will be transferred
back to prison

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:34.800
In indiana in the morning.

What was it like,

01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:48.480
Being the most wanted woman
in america?

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.780
Horrible.

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:51.110
You can't ever relax.

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.320
The key is
moving forward,

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.720
It's a waste of time
looking back.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.150
You did something,
you didn't do something,

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.690
It doesn't really matter.

01:24:59.690 --> 01:25:03.830
Is what you do now,
today, tomorrow.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.860
You've got to have goals.

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.560
A plan...

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.770
You always got to have a plan.

01:25:10.770 --> 01:25:13.170
Is that why you started
dealing pot with rick?

01:25:13.170 --> 01:25:14.800
Rick was small-time.

01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:16.170
He hardly broke even.

01:25:16.170 --> 01:25:17.810
Drew was screwing him over,

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:21.810
So I... I got the idea
that we should branch out.

01:25:21.810 --> 01:25:23.550
Took him up to purdue,

01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:27.680
And that was pretty much
the last normal day of my life.

01:25:29.150 --> 01:25:30.350
I never hurt anyone.

01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:33.420
I'm a good person.

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:43.200
What are you doing?

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.640
You paint
a pretty picture, sarah.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.870
Sweet girl,
wrong place, wrong time,

01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:53.340
But a lot of those other people,
they paint a much darker one--

01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.280
Extortion, coercion,
manipulation, murder.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.450
I'm not a murderer.

01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:58.280
Tell me the truth
about that night.

01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:00.550
It's not gonna change
your situation.

01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:01.880
You really think I would've
planned to kill them

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:04.920
In my house with a shotgun
I bought the day before?

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.190
Maybe.

01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:09.320
Maybe you planned
to make it look

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.260
Like rick's idea
all along.

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:12.530

She's still alive!

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:24.540
Who would the cops believe?

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:30.210
A petty criminal
or a pretty physics major?

I think sarah is capable
of doing anything."

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:50.630
That's a quote
from your father.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.440
All I know is

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.310
That you will
say, or do, anything

01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:57.510
To get what you want.

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.780
[engine starts]

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.820
You know something,
marshal harlan?

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:14.360
You're a lot more handsome
in person than you are on tv.

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:17.590
You must work out a lot.
