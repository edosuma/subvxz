Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

01:12:09.739 --> 01:12:11.873
and they destroyed
our planet.

01:12:11.874 --> 01:12:15.610
And the handful of us
that are left

01:12:15.611 --> 01:12:17.779

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.784
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

01:12:23.019 --> 01:12:24.619
The core that she found

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.388
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

01:12:26.389 --> 01:12:28.156
capable of carrying us
to safety.

01:12:28.157 --> 01:12:32.328

the Kree can't reach us.

01:12:33.729 --> 01:12:36.064
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

01:12:36.065 --> 01:12:37.599
wasn't to fight wars...

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.100
but to end them.

01:12:39.101 --> 01:12:44.740
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

01:12:45.708 --> 01:12:46.908
Well, I already destroyed it.

01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:48.677
No, you destroyed
the engine.

01:12:48.678 --> 01:12:51.813

is in a remote location.

01:12:51.814 --> 01:12:56.184

01:12:56.185 --> 01:12:57.820

You're not one of them.

You don't know me.

01:13:25.514 --> 01:13:27.884
You have no idea
who I am.

01:13:29.986 --> 01:13:32.388
I don't even know
who I am!

01:13:33.623 --> 01:13:35.858
You are Carol Danvers.

01:13:37.059 --> 01:13:39.227

on that black box

01:13:39.228 --> 01:13:41.864

My best friend...

01:13:45.635 --> 01:13:48.637

as a mother and a pilot

01:13:48.638 --> 01:13:50.705
when no one else did.

01:13:50.706 --> 01:13:55.911
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

01:13:55.912 --> 01:13:59.247
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

01:13:59.248 --> 01:14:02.518
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

Get some rest, sir.

01:52:13.343 --> 01:52:15.211
You got
a big decision to make.

This is a nightmare.

I've had better nightmares.

01:55:24.266 --> 01:55:26.402
So, that thing just stopped

01:55:26.403 --> 01:55:28.170
doing whatever the hell
it was doing.

What do we got?

01:55:32.675 --> 01:55:35.276
Whatever signal it was
sending finally crapped out.

<font color="#ff8000">RHODES</font>: We did.

01:55:37.514 --> 01:55:41.316
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

01:55:41.317 --> 01:55:43.251
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

01:55:43.252 --> 01:55:44.720
We don't even know
what this is.

01:55:44.721 --> 01:55:47.456
Fury did.
Just do it, please.

01:55:47.457 --> 01:55:50.191
You tell me
the second you get a signal.

01:55:50.192 --> 01:55:52.595
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

01:55:55.532 --> 01:55:57.065
Where's Fury?
