00:25.215 --> 00:26.853
I do have your boat, sir.

00:27.255 --> 00:29.294
Yes, less than a mile from the marina.

00:29.944 --> 00:31.992
Yes, sir, you will ;
it's a beauty.

00:32.158 --> 00:33.568
All right, see you in ten.

00:58.133 --> 01:02.212
Driver of the truck was delivering a boat.
Said the other guy came out of nowhere.

01:02.281 --> 01:04.319
Is this the other guy ?

01:04.367 --> 01:06.351
Paramedics tried to save him,

01:06.711 --> 01:08.018
but they were too late.

01:08.019 --> 01:09.261
Alexx ?

01:09.262 --> 01:10.985
Way too late, Horatio.

01:10.986 --> 01:12.788
The crash didn't kill this guy.

01:12.789 --> 01:13.922
What do you mean ?

01:14.248 --> 01:16.183
He's covered in lacerations.

01:16.184 --> 01:19.598
If he were alive during impact,
there'd be blood everywhere.

01:20.431 --> 01:21.786
There's almost none.

01:21.886 --> 01:24.053
And that's advanced rigor, isn't it

01:25.060 --> 01:26.493
It is.

01:29.441 --> 01:33.155
He died hours before
this accident ever happened.

01:33.156 --> 01:34.988
So our accident...

01:36.246 --> 01:38.048
is not an accident at all.

02:30.119 --> 02:33.029
Jake Sullivan. Surfside.

02:33.245 --> 02:35.289
Still missing his right foot.

02:37.395 --> 02:39.183
Get taken off in the crash ?

02:39.243 --> 02:40.272
Can't say.

02:40.273 --> 02:44.821
Lack of blood at the lacerated area
indicates it was severed after death.

02:44.822 --> 02:46.636
All right, I'll keep my eyes peeled.

02:52.251 --> 02:53.225
Eric...

02:53.414 --> 02:56.097
How fast was the vehicle going when it hit the boat ?

02:56.098 --> 02:59.191
The guy towing the boat
said he was going at least 40.

02:59.192 --> 03:02.137
I don't see anything jammed
against the accelerator.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.128
Then how did a dead man hit the gas ?

03:05.915 --> 03:07.658
With help from the living.

03:19.245 --> 03:21.006
Tim Speedle, please.

03:22.699 --> 03:26.310
Ma'am, I was a colleague of Tim's.
Can I help you ?

03:26.311 --> 03:30.079
Was ? Oh, um, did he leave the department ?

03:31.019 --> 03:33.717
Um, Tim...

03:34.869 --> 03:37.602
Tim was killed in the line
of duty a few months ago.

03:41.217 --> 03:43.236
Tim told me to call if I needed help.

03:43.237 --> 03:46.357
He'd arrested the guy that killed
my friend Ashley Anders.

03:46.358 --> 03:47.855
Yes, I remember the case.

03:47.856 --> 03:50.697
After what happened to Ashley,
I got out of the business.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.306
You mean the film business ?

03:52.307 --> 03:54.324
Adult films, yeah.

03:54.346 --> 03:59.033
It wasn't easy. The producer I used
to work for, Vince Fisher-- a real prince--

03:59.266 --> 04:01.769
he wouldn't let me go. Kept calling.

04:01.988 --> 04:03.740
And you told him no, right ?

04:03.943 --> 04:07.275
I... went back to school and dyed my hair.

04:07.276 --> 04:09.910
Met a guy... nice guy.

04:09.911 --> 04:14.341
I guess I was kind of amazed how easy it
was to leave "Cookie Devine" behind me.

04:14.481 --> 04:16.202
How can I help, Sara ?

04:17.053 --> 04:18.897
Matthew, my boyfriend,

04:18.898 --> 04:22.288
he wanted to videotape us a couple weeks ago.

04:22.289 --> 04:24.772
He's got no idea about what I used to do.

04:24.773 --> 04:26.748
So I said "yes."
Played along with it.

04:26.749 --> 04:28.468
And something happened to the tape ?

04:28.469 --> 04:31.980
Yeah. I looked for it
the other night. It was gone.

04:32.010 --> 04:36.255
It's my worst nightmare. It would
put me right back in the porn biz.

04:40.913 --> 04:41.925
You ask him about it ?

04:41.926 --> 04:44.105
He's got no idea. We looked everywhere.

04:44.106 --> 04:47.345
He's worried about it, too,
but not for the same reasons I am.

04:47.346 --> 04:50.265
Because if the tape comes out,
so does your past, right ?

04:50.454 --> 04:54.708
I don't care if the rest of the world knows
that there's a new Cookie Devine video.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.584
I just don't want Matthew to.

04:56.585 --> 05:00.326
I understand. Let me look into this, okay ?

05:00.497 --> 05:01.904
Thank you.

05:16.243 --> 05:17.421
Miss?

05:19.422 --> 05:21.086
This is my husband.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.975
You're not supposed to see him yet.

05:26.956 --> 05:29.451
You go back on upstairs, okay ?

05:29.577 --> 05:30.905
What happened to him ?

05:31.456 --> 05:33.765
His ear-- it's all messed up.

05:34.303 --> 05:36.665
I'm going to try and determine that now.

05:38.568 --> 05:40.143
Go back, okay ?

05:48.606 --> 05:50.634
- The guy's wife ?
- Yeah.

05:50.635 --> 05:52.694
We need a new receptionist upstairs.

05:52.695 --> 05:55.413
I'm just glad she didn't notice
he's missing a foot.

05:55.414 --> 05:56.491
You find that foot ?

05:56.492 --> 06:00.498
Hey, I said I'd keep an eye
out for it, but I didn't find it.

06:00.499 --> 06:02.552
You're body parts, I'm crime scene.

06:02.824 --> 06:04.905
And here I thought we were
working on the same team.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.959
I can't complete post without it.

06:07.404 --> 06:11.483
I can look right here and see that
it's blunt force trauma to the head.

06:11.484 --> 06:14.573
You can see a lot of things,
doesn't make it cause of death.

06:14.574 --> 06:17.552
Lots of old injuries--
scarring, keloids.

06:17.553 --> 06:20.041
- Childhood abuse ?
- Could be.

06:20.042 --> 06:22.859
Or he could just be part
of the Jackass generation.

06:22.860 --> 06:26.647
And then there's what the accident did.
His ear's almost shredded off.

06:26.648 --> 06:30.212
Did you get the T.O.D. or
do we need the foot for that, too ?

06:31.303 --> 06:36.755
Liver temp at the scene puts the
boy's time of death about 1:00 a.m.

06:36.756 --> 06:39.525
And if you don't get out of here,
you're going to be next.

06:39.815 --> 06:41.735
And find me that foot.

06:44.376 --> 06:48.994
Mr. Fisher, I understand you've
been trying to contact Sara Piper.

06:48.995 --> 06:50.049
Cookie ?

06:50.348 --> 06:51.666
She's retired.

06:51.815 --> 06:53.260
That's the way I want to keep it.

06:53.261 --> 06:56.253
Well, okay, relax.
What do you think I did ?

06:56.254 --> 07:00.472
She's missing some personal property
from a house she shares with her boyfriend.

07:01.828 --> 07:03.112
She has a boyfriend ?

07:03.632 --> 07:05.569
A civilian ?

07:05.705 --> 07:07.225
Yeah, that'll last.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.092
That's not your business.

07:09.140 --> 07:10.795
Look, I sell porn.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.483
I don't need to steal.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.764
You think I broke into her house ?

07:14.791 --> 07:15.409
Prove it.

07:15.410 --> 07:17.480
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

07:19.611 --> 07:21.346
Gearshift's got a print.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.555
AFIS is going to have
a hard time with this one.

07:32.556 --> 07:34.102
Print's smudged.

07:34.103 --> 07:35.855
There's not much ridge detail.

07:36.168 --> 07:38.468
Killer would have had to move fast.

07:38.705 --> 07:41.085
Put the car in drive and
get out before it took off.

07:47.505 --> 07:49.374
Did you get anything from the accelerator ?

07:49.375 --> 07:51.814
No, just a lot of glass on the floorboard.

07:51.815 --> 07:53.540
That's too much for one car.

08:00.713 --> 08:02.164
Hey, look at this.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.650
Tempered glass doesn't fluoresce.

08:07.790 --> 08:09.851
This isn't even from a car.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.951
Crystal maybe ?

08:12.025 --> 08:14.900
Well, whatever it is,
it's from the same source.

08:29.721 --> 08:32.861
"Best Overall Title: Thrash Canyon."

08:33.625 --> 08:36.881
That looks like some sort of logo,
doesn't it ? Do your recognize it ?

08:36.883 --> 08:39.888
Yeah, it's Strong Studios.
It's Dave Strong.

08:39.889 --> 08:41.705
You say that like I'm supposed
to know who it is.

08:41.706 --> 08:45.571
Dave Strong's a skateboarder.
He's like the skateboarder.

08:45.724 --> 08:49.595
Turned his hobby into an empire and he
runs the hottest video game company around.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.498
Maybe our dead guy worked there.

08:56.946 --> 08:59.051
Sure, I knew him.

08:59.284 --> 09:02.501
Jake was one of my testers
on Skate Park Extreme.

09:02.502 --> 09:03.927
What's a tester ?

09:04.075 --> 09:08.789
Well, before we sign off on a game,
testers hunt for bugs, try to make it crash.

09:08.925 --> 09:10.639
It's our version of quality control.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.111
When did you last see him ?

09:12.112 --> 09:17.055
Um, midnight. He was in the motion capture
studio messing around on the vert ramp.

09:17.465 --> 09:19.935
They think I don't know
when they go in, fool around.

09:19.936 --> 09:23.872
We're going to need to see that room,
and take a look at your personnel files.

09:24.246 --> 09:26.773
Why ? I thought Jake
was in a car accident ?

09:26.774 --> 09:29.189
He was, but somebody killed him before that.

09:29.283 --> 09:31.769
And you just became the last
person to see him alive.

09:44.655 --> 09:45.762
Right.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.903
So what exactly are you doing here ?

09:49.904 --> 09:54.089
I do motion capture for our
sim titles, like Skate Park Extreme.

09:54.090 --> 09:55.380
And what's a sim title ?

09:55.381 --> 09:57.948
Simulation. It's real athletes doing real moves.

09:57.949 --> 10:00.170
Close as anybody ever gets to being me.

10:00.544 --> 10:04.002
Uh, the carpet's damp.
Get this cleaned lately ?

10:07.359 --> 10:08.905
Do you mind if we test for blood ?

10:08.906 --> 10:10.251
Do I have a choice ?

10:19.720 --> 10:20.506
Nothing.

10:20.507 --> 10:24.699
Either there was never any blood here to begin with or somebody cleaned it up very well.

10:28.723 --> 10:30.201
Not that well.

10:30.319 --> 10:31.894
Got blood drops.

10:38.211 --> 10:40.237
Medium velocity spatter.

10:41.646 --> 10:44.017
It's still red and unoxidized.

10:44.842 --> 10:46.054
It's fresh.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.243
A little blood--
a badge of honor.

10:49.244 --> 10:51.162
I make my living skateboarding here.

10:51.163 --> 10:52.588
I'm sure it's mine.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.377
Give us a DNA sample and
we'll let you know for sure.

10:55.782 --> 10:57.136
How kind of you.

10:57.334 --> 10:58.800
And your skateboard.

10:58.801 --> 11:01.880
It's in plain sight. Unfortunately
for you it's coming with us.

11:03.485 --> 11:04.786
Is this cube one of yours ?

11:06.814 --> 11:08.066
I make 'em.

11:08.101 --> 11:08.870
I don't keep 'em.

11:08.905 --> 11:11.064
I give 'em as awards to my guys.

11:11.099 --> 11:12.350
It's motivational.

11:12.385 --> 11:13.251
Who got this one ?

11:13.286 --> 11:14.538
"Thrash Canyon ?"

11:14.573 --> 11:16.273
My best programmer.

11:16.953 --> 11:18.163
Ron Benson.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.953
Now look, I get about three of these a year.

11:26.988 --> 11:28.511
They make great doorstops.

11:28.546 --> 11:29.976
Where'd you keep this one ?

11:30.311 --> 11:31.567
Who knows.

11:31.602 --> 11:33.638
Um, probably by that wall.

11:34.424 --> 11:36.593
Those cubes are classic Dave Strong.

11:36.628 --> 11:38.664
Builds a gym we're too busy to use,

11:38.699 --> 11:41.714
sends flowers in our name to
girlfriends we're too busy to see.

11:41.749 --> 11:43.424
How about a raise and some time off, huh ?

11:43.459 --> 11:44.480
Hmm.

11:44.815 --> 11:46.724
You got a sticky substance.

11:47.929 --> 11:49.120
Syrupy.

11:50.651 --> 11:51.749
But no cube.

11:51.784 --> 11:53.115
I guess somebody took it.

11:56.310 --> 11:58.458
You're not a big fan of the testers, are you, Ron ?

11:59.534 --> 12:01.348
I graduated M.I.T. in three years,

12:01.383 --> 12:04.213
and now I got those mouthbreathers
telling me what's wrong with my game.

12:04.248 --> 12:05.357
Like Jake ?

12:05.954 --> 12:09.016
You two got in shoving matches
twice on this project alone.

12:09.881 --> 12:12.707
Strong likes us to keep it confrontational.

12:12.742 --> 12:15.838
If a tester and programmer become
friends, he fires the tester.

12:15.873 --> 12:16.983
Where were you last night ?

12:17.018 --> 12:18.349
Right here, thanks to Jake.

12:18.384 --> 12:20.890
I've been fixing bugs for 72 hours straight.

12:20.925 --> 12:22.017
Any way to prove that ?

12:22.352 --> 12:23.561
Yeah.

12:23.596 --> 12:27.193
Strong won't admit it, but he's
got spyware on all our computers.

12:27.228 --> 12:29.102
He's spying on his own people ?

12:29.337 --> 12:31.689
That's a pleasant work environment.

12:32.868 --> 12:35.679
Every keystroke I type gets
recorded on the main server.

12:44.158 --> 12:45.367
Excuse me, Miss, we're...

12:45.992 --> 12:47.745
Last one's a dozen roses.

12:48.676 --> 12:49.974
I know it's boring.

12:50.009 --> 12:51.174
So is the guy.

12:52.550 --> 12:54.479
To Kathy Helms.

12:57.976 --> 13:00.706
Sign it, "To my one and only. Love, Greg."

13:01.491 --> 13:02.660
We need access to your server.

13:02.695 --> 13:04.075
Can we get there from your computer ?

13:04.110 --> 13:06.466
Yeah, but Dave's not gonna like that.

13:06.501 --> 13:07.867
Okay. Well, we'll get a warrant,

13:07.902 --> 13:10.078
bring a class of recruits
from the academy down here,

13:10.113 --> 13:11.133
have 'em poke around.

13:11.168 --> 13:13.233
But they're kind of clumsy. And real slow.

13:15.967 --> 13:17.542
Fine.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.597
Do you have a clue what
any of this code means ?

13:35.632 --> 13:39.184
No, except it proves our
programmer was typing at 1:00 a.m.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.659
He was telling the truth. He
hasn't left his desk for two days.

13:41.694 --> 13:43.011
Well, somebody did.

13:43.046 --> 13:44.793
And they took our victim with them.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.563
That's where we hid the tape.

14:23.174 --> 14:24.217
Matthew.

14:24.252 --> 14:26.031
I thought you were playing pickup.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.344
Uh, it got canceled. Hey.

14:29.838 --> 14:30.865
Saw the humvee out front.

14:30.900 --> 14:31.809
Everything all right ?

14:33.682 --> 14:35.749
Yeah, we've had, um,

14:35.784 --> 14:38.283
reports of break-ins in the area recently.

14:38.318 --> 14:40.674
Yeah, I got worried and
called Lieutenant Caine.

14:40.709 --> 14:42.566
Why does my girlfriend have your number ?

14:42.601 --> 14:44.301
Well, I worked on a case,

14:44.336 --> 14:46.421
um, that involved her friend at one point.

14:46.456 --> 14:47.716
Who ?

14:47.751 --> 14:49.104
You know, that's not important.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.727
Have you had guests recently ?

14:51.062 --> 14:53.496
No, but we did have a contractor

14:53.531 --> 14:54.512
about three weeks ago,

14:54.547 --> 14:56.293
replaced the doors behind you.

15:05.507 --> 15:06.788
What do you see ?

15:08.596 --> 15:11.390
I see fingerprints that shouldn't be here.

15:11.425 --> 15:14.765
And these doors have been put in backwards.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.968
Why would the contractor do that ?

15:17.003 --> 15:19.208
Maybe because he was coming back.

15:20.339 --> 15:21.931
Do you have his phone number ?

15:22.817 --> 15:24.466
Yeah, actually I do, right here.

15:38.618 --> 15:40.872
Happy couple needed a set of doors,

15:40.907 --> 15:41.864
I did the work,

15:41.899 --> 15:42.944
they paid me,

15:42.979 --> 15:45.156
I left, end of story.

15:45.191 --> 15:46.339
But you came back.

15:46.374 --> 15:48.744
Installed doors so you could gain easy entry.

16:00.079 --> 16:02.700
You see, Connor, we found
your prints on the end table.

16:02.735 --> 16:04.249
You stole the videotape,

16:04.284 --> 16:05.913
and I want it back right now.

16:08.319 --> 16:09.593
I don't have it anymore.

16:09.628 --> 16:10.574
Who has it ?

16:10.609 --> 16:11.342
Look.

16:12.110 --> 16:13.806
I saw it was Cookie Devine.

16:20.872 --> 16:23.470
I know a guy who said
we could make some cash.

16:23.505 --> 16:24.557
Cash how ?

16:24.592 --> 16:26.206
He takes orders over the Internet.

16:26.441 --> 16:29.170
By the time you shut him
down, he'll be a millionaire.

16:31.745 --> 16:33.314
I want your partner's name.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.913
I only know where he's running dubs.

16:38.948 --> 16:41.063
You better hope it's enough.

16:47.976 --> 16:49.018
Houseboat ?

16:49.353 --> 16:50.749
You sure this is the right place ?

16:50.784 --> 16:51.931
We're gonna find out.

16:52.266 --> 16:53.451
Good afternoon.

16:54.633 --> 16:56.033
Are you the owner of record ?

16:57.218 --> 16:58.163
Brandon Pace.

16:58.198 --> 16:58.997
Good.

16:59.032 --> 17:01.706
A warrant to search your place.

17:02.477 --> 17:04.178
Uh, there's, there's nothing back there.

17:04.213 --> 17:06.070
Just some clothes and stuff, I swear.

17:07.132 --> 17:08.069
Just, uh...

17:08.104 --> 17:09.053
Hey...

17:12.540 --> 17:14.252
Oh, look at that.

17:19.666 --> 17:20.868
Mr. Pace...

17:20.904 --> 17:21.790
It's not my movie.

17:21.826 --> 17:23.012
We're aware of that.

17:23.048 --> 17:24.531
No, really, I'm just the middleman.

17:24.566 --> 17:27.673
I dub them and ship them
and the seller pays me a fee.

17:27.708 --> 17:30.293
So how many copies did you make of this, uh,

17:30.328 --> 17:33.484
Cookie Devine video for
your friend Connor Meade ?

17:33.519 --> 17:36.104
Uh, I don't... Connor...
I don't know who that is.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.558
You know, the contractor
who gave you the master.

17:38.593 --> 17:39.769
All I know is a dude named Derek.

17:39.804 --> 17:40.888
How many'd you make for Derek ?

17:42.742 --> 17:43.647
Five thou.

17:44.527 --> 17:46.722
Really ? Only a few left.

17:46.757 --> 17:47.875
Where's the rest ?

17:47.910 --> 17:49.714
Truck came by this
morning, picked them up.

17:49.749 --> 17:53.819
I need a proof of payment and the State
Attorney may show you some leniency.

17:53.854 --> 17:55.914
Uh, attorney ?

17:56.149 --> 17:57.599
It's Cookie Devine.

17:57.634 --> 17:59.765
It's not like she hasn't
been in this position before.

18:01.219 --> 18:02.450
You know what ?

18:02.685 --> 18:04.155
You just blew your chance.

18:06.093 --> 18:07.800
Turn around, you're under arrest.

18:47.365 --> 18:48.830
How's our sticky substance ?

18:48.865 --> 18:50.202
Where the cube should have been ?

18:50.237 --> 18:50.976
Yeah.

18:51.011 --> 18:53.157
It's a soft drink. Chappy's Cola.

18:54.212 --> 18:57.320
I thought that all soft drinks were
made of high fructose corn syrup.

18:57.555 --> 18:59.043
In the U.S., they are.

18:59.078 --> 19:01.420
If you want cane sugar, you
have to import it from Mexico.

19:01.455 --> 19:02.953
Soda snobs demand it

19:02.988 --> 19:05.105
they say it tastes sweeter and cleaner.

19:05.140 --> 19:07.486
Are there any soda snobs
working at the company ?

19:07.521 --> 19:08.035
One.

19:08.070 --> 19:10.585
I talked to Rachel, the world's
friendliest receptionist,

19:10.620 --> 19:13.688
and she said she special orders
it for a guy named Todd Simmons.

19:13.723 --> 19:14.680
What's he do there ?

19:14.715 --> 19:15.814
He's a tester.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.556
Just like our victim.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.163
Except Todd's still alive.

19:26.603 --> 19:29.731
So, I was drinking a soda in
Ron's office yesterday morning.

19:29.766 --> 19:31.065
Just hanging out.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.035
By the wall with your messenger bag ?

19:34.228 --> 19:35.989
Did you steal the cube, Todd ?

19:36.224 --> 19:37.920
Use it to weigh down the gas pedal ?

19:49.253 --> 19:50.545
I didn't steal the cube.

19:50.580 --> 19:51.921
I didn't see a cube.

19:59.270 --> 20:01.335
Ron already told us that
testers and programmers

20:01.336 --> 20:03.400
don't hang out with each
other unless they have to.

20:04.817 --> 20:06.288
Do you want to revise your story ?

20:08.161 --> 20:09.674
Okay...

20:10.382 --> 20:12.534
This job gives me a lot
of tension sometimes.

20:12.569 --> 20:15.182
I, uh, self-medicate.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.552
Ron's got the best weed.

20:17.587 --> 20:19.599
I snagged a blunt while
he was in the men's room.

20:20.039 --> 20:21.563
That's an interesting defense.

20:22.682 --> 20:23.593
Duquesne.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.298
It did ?

20:25.333 --> 20:26.417
Good.

20:26.452 --> 20:27.321
Thanks, Valera.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.479
Where's your boss ?

20:28.514 --> 20:29.703
Where is he always ?

21:06.776 --> 21:08.498
Get winded faster than I used to.

21:10.524 --> 21:12.667
Our lab just told us that
the blood from your floor

21:12.668 --> 21:14.811
and the skateboard is
also from our victim.

21:15.046 --> 21:15.940
Really ?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.572
Is this where I call my lawyer ?

21:17.607 --> 21:19.083
No, it won't matter.

21:19.118 --> 21:21.778
Judge granted a warrant for
everything in here off that blood.

21:28.760 --> 21:31.314
Were you the only person being
motion captured last night ?

21:31.349 --> 21:34.137
Unlike most people, I really
am the star in my own movie.

21:34.634 --> 21:36.224
Then we'll need all your footage.

21:40.392 --> 21:43.195
This is all the captured
data from last night.

21:43.230 --> 21:44.585
What am I looking for ?

21:44.620 --> 21:47.610
Basically, there are motion
capture cameras all over the stage,

21:47.645 --> 21:51.331
and if Strong killed the tester, maybe
he forgot and left the motion sensors on.

21:51.366 --> 21:53.938
And that the murder was being recorded.

21:59.912 --> 22:01.770
Why are you stopping it ?
He's just skating.

22:01.805 --> 22:03.665
Mm, but something isn't right.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.210
Look,

22:05.299 --> 22:07.255
This is the mo-cap from

22:07.293 --> 22:10.704
last night, when Strong was
doing all of his toughest moves.

22:10.811 --> 22:11.922
And...

22:12.031 --> 22:15.001
this is the footage captured
today when your were there.

22:15.090 --> 22:17.552
He didn't do a 720 or a McTwist.

22:18.726 --> 22:20.031
He's taking it easy.

22:20.625 --> 22:23.547
Any way you can compare the
height of the two figures ?

22:28.738 --> 22:30.919
Well, our figures are two different sizes.

22:30.994 --> 22:33.085
Which means they're two different guys.

22:33.159 --> 22:35.414
Our vic wasn't just messing around.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.283
He was a ringer.

22:37.410 --> 22:39.264
Dave Strong is a fraud.

22:41.904 --> 22:44.738
Tyler, will you skip to the footage
at the end of the night last night ?

22:44.752 --> 22:45.820
Yeah.

22:50.122 --> 22:52.258
Wait, play that back and loop it.

22:55.136 --> 22:56.190
Whoa.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.400
Is that your vic from the car accident ?

22:59.690 --> 23:02.375
Yeah, there's the blunt force trauma.

23:02.553 --> 23:05.149
Still doesn't explain how
he ended up in the car.

23:13.528 --> 23:17.266
One thing's for sure. It isn't just
motion capture, it's a snuff video.

23:30.815 --> 23:34.745
We analyzed the footage from your
motion-capture stage last night, Mr. Strong.

23:34.849 --> 23:38.261
All that P.R. about you skating
your own tricks is a lie.

23:38.913 --> 23:40.263
It's been Jake all along.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.471
So what ?

23:51.827 --> 23:56.337
So, you've got millions of people
shelling out 50 bucks for a sim title

23:56.470 --> 23:58.680
of you doing your latest tricks.

23:59.541 --> 24:01.914
I don't have time to skate anymore.

24:02.701 --> 24:04.748
Think my business runs on its own ?

24:04.926 --> 24:07.314
I've got licensing issues to work out,

24:07.492 --> 24:09.643
partnership deals, endorsements.

24:09.747 --> 24:13.633
Sounds incredibly corporate for a guy who
used to tear it up in empty swimming pools.

24:13.722 --> 24:15.072
So, I grew up.

24:15.101 --> 24:16.319
Jake didn't.

24:16.363 --> 24:18.499
I'd rather walk upright when I'm 50.

24:18.796 --> 24:21.555
And I paid him a pretty sum for his services.

24:21.659 --> 24:23.847
Were you afraid he'd tell people
the truth about your deal ?

24:23.870 --> 24:26.287
Couldn't, he signed a confidentiality clause.

24:26.450 --> 24:27.666
Besides,

24:27.726 --> 24:30.099
I already trademarked every move he ever made.

24:30.203 --> 24:33.214
And you'll pass them off
to a willing public as your own.

24:34.030 --> 24:35.514
It's called capitalism.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.035
If you want to arrest me for that,

24:37.079 --> 24:38.414
be my guest.

24:38.622 --> 24:39.987
Say whatever you want.

24:40.194 --> 24:42.004
Otherwise, I'd like to go find a replacement.

24:45.402 --> 24:46.529
Cynthia,

24:46.633 --> 24:48.339
- did you get anything for me ?
- I do.

24:48.413 --> 24:50.326
Can't say it's a slam dunk, though.

24:50.556 --> 24:53.226
Your guy, Brandon Pace,
was paid in money orders.

24:53.285 --> 24:54.680
Six of them, to be exact.

24:54.724 --> 24:55.822
Six of them ?

24:55.866 --> 24:57.083
A thousand dollars each.

24:57.127 --> 25:00.583
The institutions that issue money orders
place monetary limits on them.

25:00.658 --> 25:03.135
But they don't require I.D.
to purchase, do they ?

25:03.210 --> 25:04.514
Nope, only to cash.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.710
Tell me about the person who signed them.

25:06.784 --> 25:08.163
Derek Baldwin ?

25:08.291 --> 25:11.495
Guy doesn't exist. But I did
learn one thing about him :

25:11.658 --> 25:12.681
he's left-handed.

25:12.726 --> 25:14.719
I thought you couldn't tell
that from a writing sample.

25:14.743 --> 25:17.784
Well, normally, no.
But there are some indicators.

25:18.021 --> 25:20.988
I'll flip through the sequence under infrared.

25:24.193 --> 25:28.361
Yes, I see. The ink becomes more and
more smudged with each money order.

25:28.569 --> 25:31.729
This person wrote it with their left hand,
the side of their palm

25:31.803 --> 25:35.660
dipped into the wet ink, and transferred it
to the subsequent money orders.

25:40.829 --> 25:42.653
So that narrows it down to about

25:42.817 --> 25:44.730
ten percent of the population.

25:45.131 --> 25:46.495
That help you at all ?

25:56.606 --> 25:58.148
As a matter of fact...

25:59.320 --> 26:00.907
it does help me.

26:01.026 --> 26:02.198
Do me a favor

26:02.257 --> 26:03.726
and compare this

26:04.690 --> 26:06.040
to the money orders.

26:15.475 --> 26:18.116
Slant proportion of the letters are similar.

26:19.777 --> 26:23.040
Take a look at how this person
writes their lower case "d."

26:23.233 --> 26:25.740
The "d"'s are identical, aren't they ?

26:25.984 --> 26:28.951
Class characteristics show that
people create a loop

26:29.025 --> 26:32.200
on the cursive "d" to complete
the final downstroke.

26:32.593 --> 26:34.729
Whoever wrote this just retraced the upstroke,

26:34.789 --> 26:37.755
and didn't connect it to the subsequent letter.

26:38.112 --> 26:42.310
And it also means that Sara was
not the only one disguising her identity.

26:42.384 --> 26:43.630
Thank you.

26:43.749 --> 26:45.514
All right, all right. I did it, all right ?

26:45.648 --> 26:46.864
I sold the tape.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.919
You knew who Sara was from
the beginning, didn't you ?

26:51.625 --> 26:52.916
You also knew the value of the tape.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.355
No, no, no, I didn't.

26:54.599 --> 26:57.091
I just thought she was
a sweet girl, I mean...

26:57.478 --> 27:03.268
I even felt guilty for asking her to do it in the
first place. That's why I tried to erase it.
But when I went to look for it, it was gone.

27:11.623 --> 27:14.174
There's only one person
who could have taken it :

27:14.946 --> 27:16.236
the contractor.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.461
Hey, you !

27:19.062 --> 27:20.888
Hey, whoa, man, hold up a second.

27:20.932 --> 27:23.302
- You stole my tape and I want it back.
- Hey, hey, hey, hold up !

27:23.321 --> 27:25.501
- That's it. I'm calling the cops.
- Okay, listen,

27:25.561 --> 27:29.254
I'm sorry. If I was with Cookie Devine,
I'd put up billboards.

27:29.498 --> 27:30.922
Cookie Devine ?

27:32.769 --> 27:34.282
You have no idea, do you ?

27:38.190 --> 27:39.540
I didn't believe him.

27:41.031 --> 27:42.144
I couldn't.

27:45.333 --> 27:46.638
So he showed me.

27:47.551 --> 27:49.050
I've got 15 of her titles.

27:49.109 --> 27:50.637
She's a superstar.

28:02.827 --> 28:04.562
I took her to meet my parents.

28:04.959 --> 28:07.614
And she was going to be the
mother of my kids. She lied to me.

28:07.674 --> 28:10.878
She didn't lie to you, Matthew.
She just didn't know how to tell you.

28:11.101 --> 28:13.563
The copies this morning,
where are they now ?

28:14.572 --> 28:15.388
Gone.

28:15.432 --> 28:16.708
Okay. Who'd you sell them to ?

28:16.737 --> 28:20.802
I-I-I don't know. Some company
used to produce her old films.

28:21.039 --> 28:22.463
That's all I need to know.

28:23.413 --> 28:25.623
Do you want to call her, or should I ?

28:28.412 --> 28:29.628
Wolfe...

28:30.043 --> 28:31.438
check this out.

28:32.565 --> 28:36.021
I was looking for prints.
I didn't find any, but I did find this.

28:39.426 --> 28:42.096
- Oh, there's orange particles jammed into the grip tape.
- Yeah

28:42.185 --> 28:46.058
some on each side of the board,
right where the killer would have held it.

28:47.719 --> 28:48.995
What's the substance ?

28:49.009 --> 28:50.152
It's pollen.

28:50.196 --> 28:53.444
Now, I checked it under the scope,
and I ran a comparison.

28:53.548 --> 28:54.883
It's from a lily.

29:00.002 --> 29:01.277
A lily...

29:03.748 --> 29:04.602
Oh, man,

29:04.608 --> 29:10.452
the receptionist at Strong Studios had
flowers all over her desk. She sends them
to employees' wives and girlfriends.

29:10.601 --> 29:12.974
Okay. I'll get over there.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.767
And you pick all the
flowers out yourself ?

29:20.811 --> 29:23.540
Sure do. I even write a
little note with each one.

29:23.659 --> 29:25.276
Seems kind of personal.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.461
Hey, I spend more time
with their guys than they do.

29:28.668 --> 29:31.338
Have you sent out any
bouquets of lilies recently ?

29:32.815 --> 29:35.530
Probably an order went out yesterday.
Here, let me check.

29:38.063 --> 29:38.915
Yep.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.733
Here it is. "Lilies."

29:40.985 --> 29:42.943
Just one person got them, though.

29:43.076 --> 29:44.159
Who ?

29:44.352 --> 29:46.073
Amber, Amber Haynes.

29:47.070 --> 29:48.405
What did the card say ?

29:49.088 --> 29:50.393
That one was...

29:50.957 --> 29:53.063
"We'll be together soon. I love you."

29:58.005 --> 29:59.296
Is there something wrong ?

30:00.898 --> 30:02.559
Take a look at your destination.

30:04.250 --> 30:08.054
The flowers you sent to Amber Haynes,
they went to Jake Sullivan's address.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.175
To his wife, Julie.

30:10.249 --> 30:11.584
Oh, no.

30:13.928 --> 30:15.530
Is there something I can do ?

30:15.574 --> 30:17.265
You can give me her number,

30:17.324 --> 30:18.570
please.

30:25.041 --> 30:26.361
Hello, Maxine.

30:27.488 --> 30:28.645
Maxine ?

30:28.779 --> 30:30.559
- Oh, Dr. Woods !
- Hi.

30:30.589 --> 30:31.998
Hi. Uh, sorry.

30:32.041 --> 30:34.814
No one here ever calls me by my
first name. Almost forgot I had one.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.557
No worries, honey. Sometimes...

30:38.070 --> 30:40.844
- Hey, you smell that ?
- I've been smelling it all afternoon.

30:40.889 --> 30:42.299
It's like...

30:42.566 --> 30:45.829
- Ew.
- Exactly. Should only smell
that way in my building.

30:46.081 --> 30:47.920
Here, Ryan, you want to
help me in the garage ?

30:48.009 --> 30:49.967
Sure. What's in the garage ?

30:51.777 --> 30:53.023
Decomp.

30:59.785 --> 31:01.788
Yeah, you're right about the decomp, Alexx.

31:02.055 --> 31:03.627
It gets worse in here.

31:10.482 --> 31:12.648
- Here we go.
- You find something ?

31:13.894 --> 31:15.214
Yeah, I think a...

31:15.318 --> 31:16.489
size 11.

31:16.618 --> 31:18.561
Now we're getting somewhere.

31:18.709 --> 31:19.851
What is it ?

31:19.911 --> 31:23.797
Well, unless I'm mistaken,
looks like a contact burn.

31:26.141 --> 31:27.743
I gotta find the other end.

31:31.504 --> 31:32.780
You're welcome.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.473
Mrs. Sullivan, may I see your hands, please ?

31:37.289 --> 31:38.090
Why ?

31:38.141 --> 31:42.443
Because pollen from lilies is one of
the most persistent types of pollen.

31:42.555 --> 31:43.786
It flakes,

31:43.949 --> 31:45.255
it stains.

31:45.448 --> 31:48.682
And it can lodge itself
in the smallest of spaces.

32:04.267 --> 32:06.389
You received a bouquet of lilies

32:06.492 --> 32:08.398
yesterday afternoon from your

32:08.614 --> 32:10.171
husband, didn't you ?

32:12.150 --> 32:15.294
I believed him when he said
he was at work all the time.

32:17.475 --> 32:19.507
To find out about her like that...

32:34.425 --> 32:36.309
Look, I know what it looked like,

32:36.381 --> 32:38.636
but Jake wasn't seeing another woman.

32:39.674 --> 32:42.003
- What ?
- His office sent the flowers.

32:42.077 --> 32:45.237
The receptionist accidentally
switched the two names.

32:47.706 --> 32:48.340
No.

32:55.925 --> 32:57.601
I went to see him last night.

33:31.351 --> 33:32.503
Don't lie to me.

33:32.559 --> 33:33.839
I have proof !

33:33.840 --> 33:35.690
I-I don't even know
a woman named Amber.

33:35.691 --> 33:37.570
Oh, I mean, why am I even fighting for you ?

33:37.575 --> 33:40.332
Look at yourself.
Skateboarding at 35 ?

33:40.464 --> 33:41.647
You're pathetic !

33:41.648 --> 33:42.948
Well, wait ! Wa...

33:53.483 --> 33:55.111
He tried to tell me, but...

33:55.850 --> 33:57.513
I wouldn't listen.

34:03.655 --> 34:05.516
I didn't mean to kill him.

34:21.154 --> 34:23.228
What are you doing ?
I'm in the middle of a confession.

34:23.552 --> 34:25.625
Wife got mad, and she hit him
in the head with a skateboard.

34:25.626 --> 34:28.359
She might have caused the
blunt force trauma to his head, Eric,

34:28.360 --> 34:29.757
but she didn't kill him.

34:30.005 --> 34:31.170
You confirmed C.O.D. ?

34:31.188 --> 34:34.234
Just determined it : Jake
Sullivan was electrocuted.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.168
Electrocuted ?

34:35.222 --> 34:37.387
Found a contact burn on his foot.

34:38.114 --> 34:39.951
You mean, where the electricity
entered the body.

34:39.958 --> 34:41.518
Electricity hits the body,

34:41.520 --> 34:44.760
nuclei in the skin cells
stream in one direction.

34:48.366 --> 34:50.724
Shredded ear was the point of exit.

34:56.507 --> 34:58.983
I didn't know what to
look for till I got the foot.

34:59.473 --> 35:02.358
Okay, this explains the
water on the mo-cap stage.

35:02.530 --> 35:03.445
What do you mean ?

35:03.506 --> 35:05.180
We thought someone covered up the crime,

35:05.181 --> 35:06.458
but that was the crime.

35:07.477 --> 35:08.983
And if she didn't kill him,

35:09.993 --> 35:12.032
who did ?

35:20.908 --> 35:21.871
All right.

35:21.872 --> 35:23.386
Yo !

35:49.016 --> 35:51.787
You just can't leave her alone, can you ?

35:52.419 --> 35:53.513
What do you want ?

35:53.654 --> 35:55.487
You know what I want.

35:59.269 --> 36:01.832
No way. I'll get a court order.
Those are bought and paid for.

36:01.832 --> 36:04.345
This is stolen property,
and I'm confiscating it.

36:04.661 --> 36:06.640
These DVDs cost me $50,000.

36:06.641 --> 36:08.828
- How am I gonna make my money back ?
- That's your problem.

36:10.237 --> 36:14.728
If you ever contact her again,
it'll be the last time you do.

36:54.055 --> 36:54.875
That's all right, Andy.

36:58.685 --> 37:00.967
Hey, man, nice job.
Nice lein and rodeo.

37:00.967 --> 37:02.611
Chill in my office,
and I'll see you in a bit ?

37:03.661 --> 37:04.978
Is that the new Jake ?

37:05.099 --> 37:06.089
That's the new me.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.237
Do you mind ?
I'm on a deadline.

37:08.238 --> 37:10.038
Too bad, this is still a crime scene.

37:10.152 --> 37:11.009
Don't go far.

37:15.057 --> 37:15.604
Okay...

37:17.126 --> 37:18.778
water conducts electricity.

37:19.076 --> 37:21.014
We found water over here.

37:23.147 --> 37:26.282
The water cooler. Bottle's empty.

37:47.362 --> 37:48.726
Check it out.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.500
The outlet's fried.

37:52.558 --> 37:55.199
Power cord's been ripped out of
the back of the water cooler.

37:55.693 --> 37:57.666
There's something on the end of it.

37:57.664 --> 37:58.862
Skin ?

37:59.108 --> 38:00.790
Looks like it.

38:01.470 --> 38:04.088
You know, our vic had
a contact burn on his leg.

38:04.121 --> 38:05.654
You take an electrical outlet,

38:05.654 --> 38:07.095
a live wire,

38:07.136 --> 38:08.413
you add water...

38:09.882 --> 38:11.948
You got a recipe for murder.

38:12.230 --> 38:14.941
But how ? Nobody's going to stand
there and let themselves get fried.

38:15.017 --> 38:16.843
I don't think he was standing at the time.

38:22.952 --> 38:25.018
The cord was ripped out on purpose.

38:25.954 --> 38:27.633
Person used one hand as leverage.

38:31.111 --> 38:32.750
Wife hit him...

38:32.751 --> 38:34.428
let the electricity finish the job.

38:34.613 --> 38:36.196
I don't think it was a woman.

38:36.429 --> 38:37.725
The print's too big.

38:43.354 --> 38:44.283
Wait a minute.

38:44.395 --> 38:46.066
Look at all the voids in the print.

38:46.717 --> 38:47.665
Palm,

38:47.665 --> 38:48.854
the fingers

38:48.854 --> 38:49.863
and the thumb.

38:50.774 --> 38:52.182
They're the exact same spots

38:52.182 --> 38:54.883
as the prints on the gear
shift of Jake Sullivan's car.

38:55.498 --> 38:57.134
Gear shift's got a print.

38:58.291 --> 39:00.996
AFIS is gonna have
a hard time with this one.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.378
Print's smudged.

39:02.453 --> 39:03.939
There's not much ridge detail.

39:04.845 --> 39:06.480
I thought they were smudges.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.066
They're hyperkeratosis.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.811
With constant friction, the
surface of the skin thickens.

39:15.163 --> 39:17.417
Prints get worn down, they disappear.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.462
Our killer had calluses on his hands.

39:19.561 --> 39:21.920
I can think of one person
who might fit the bill.

39:22.284 --> 39:24.115
Why do you want to see my fingertips ?

39:24.451 --> 39:26.484
Because Jake Sullivan was electrocuted

39:26.484 --> 39:29.242
on the motion-capture stage
by someone with calluses.

39:29.347 --> 39:30.833
Occupational hazard, for somebody

39:30.833 --> 39:32.807
who plays video games all day long.

39:34.454 --> 39:36.070
Let's see, Todd.

39:44.096 --> 39:46.418
Can't press "Escape" on that one.

39:48.164 --> 39:50.449
I put in three years with Dave Strong.

39:51.484 --> 39:52.989
Stuffed in a cubicle...

39:53.806 --> 39:56.072
staring at a TV.
My girlfriend left me.

39:56.072 --> 39:57.453
I gained 20 pounds.

39:57.453 --> 39:58.694
No one forced you to stay there.

39:58.737 --> 40:01.281
Dave Strong did.
Kept making promises.

40:01.433 --> 40:02.827
Then Jake was hired.

40:03.278 --> 40:05.246
Walked around like he owned the place.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.762
I had seniority,
but I was doing all the work.

40:09.285 --> 40:10.398
We're in the final build,

40:10.398 --> 40:11.911
and you got the entire programming

40:11.911 --> 40:13.337
department twiddling their thumbs.

40:13.346 --> 40:15.429
I haven't seen sunlight in two weeks.

40:15.429 --> 40:17.892
Suck it up.
What's your problem ?

40:18.305 --> 40:19.669
Why don't you talk to Jake ?

40:20.678 --> 40:21.718
What ?

40:22.732 --> 40:24.435
One of you is expendable, Todd.

40:25.530 --> 40:26.942
Take a guess who that is.

40:32.665 --> 40:33.926
We had a deadline.

40:34.354 --> 40:35.994
I was gonna tear him a new one.

40:37.245 --> 40:38.897
Then I saw him, just lying there.

40:39.623 --> 40:40.312
Jake !

40:42.809 --> 40:43.606
What are you doing ?

40:49.528 --> 40:51.906
He must've hurt himself trying
to skate like Dave.

40:54.557 --> 40:57.220
It seemed so easy just to make
it look like an accident.

41:27.718 --> 41:29.437
It was so awful.

41:30.412 --> 41:32.966
I could hear his teeth grinding...

41:33.640 --> 41:35.753
smell burning hair.

41:37.125 --> 41:39.156
And then he opened his eyes.

41:45.536 --> 41:46.697
He died,

41:46.697 --> 41:47.974
staring at me.

41:48.143 --> 41:50.558
I... I freaked.

41:50.744 --> 41:52.925
And you figured you had
to get rid of the body.

42:15.396 --> 42:18.906
What you don't know is that Dave
hired Jake to skate all his moves.

42:20.106 --> 42:22.369
His job as a tester was just for show.

42:24.806 --> 42:28.135
Dave didn't favor Jake.
He just needed him.

42:31.780 --> 42:34.611
Killing's a lot easier
in a video game, isn't it?

42:48.205 --> 42:50.746
Lieutenant Caine, thank you for calling.

42:57.107 --> 42:58.697
Is this a copy of the tape ?

42:58.877 --> 43:00.066
That's the master.

43:00.199 --> 43:02.295
The other copies are being destroyed.

43:02.577 --> 43:03.677
The others ?

43:03.855 --> 43:05.802
No one will ever see this tape.

43:10.306 --> 43:11.495
Where'd you find it ?

43:12.219 --> 43:15.805
I think I'm going to let
Matthew explain that.

43:22.131 --> 43:24.061
At least I'm consistent.

43:24.497 --> 43:26.773
I always fall for the wrong guy.
