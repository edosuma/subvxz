WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.702
It's the one-year anniversary
of our very first case.

00:05.539 --> 00:08.073
Figured you're part of this firm
might as well have your name on it.

00:08.074 --> 00:10.376
Italy is gonna change your life.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.911
- Thanks, Dad. I love it.
- Ms. Everett's being charged

00:12.913 --> 00:16.465
with espionage. Your partner
stole top-secret data.

00:16.467 --> 00:18.333
- How did I miss this?
- She had us both fooled.

00:18.335 --> 00:20.669
- My name is Dana Hudson.
- I'm afraid of what other photos

00:20.671 --> 00:23.255
- he might have of me.
- Where are these photos?

00:23.257 --> 00:26.558
They're on a hard drive in the main
computer lab on the fifth floor.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.594
That guy pretending to be
my buddy's brother,

00:28.596 --> 00:30.729
- he was in on it too.
- So the whole thing,

00:30.731 --> 00:32.680
sexual harassment,
the invasion of privacy,

00:32.683 --> 00:35.067
- her father's illness...
- Was all fake.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.403
She knew it would push your
buttons, so she exploited it.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.521
You have no idea
how much this means.

00:39.523 --> 00:42.107
It's a scam! They were keeping
us apart to split our focus.

00:42.109 --> 00:43.942
Please tell me you didn't
give her the hard drive.

00:43.944 --> 00:47.413
Drop the phone! Now!

00:47.415 --> 00:49.615
- Ready to go?
- So ready.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.812
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm gonna get you out of here.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.445 --> 01:20.112
- Where are you taking me?
- Loretta wants to see you.

01:32.877 --> 01:35.327
Sit down.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.297
- Look, if I broke a rule or something...
- I said, "Sit down."

01:40.534 --> 01:42.417
You're quite the celeb.

01:42.419 --> 01:45.337
Espionage, million-dollar bond,

01:45.339 --> 01:47.923
daily meetings with
that handsome hockey player.

01:47.925 --> 01:51.226
- He's my partner. I'm a P.I.
- Good for you.

01:51.228 --> 01:55.114
The problem is you're also
a prisoner on my cell block.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.616
You may have noticed
I run things around here.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.651
Yeah, I got that impression.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.721
I like things quiet.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.774
When people come in here
and start stirring things up -

02:05.776 --> 02:07.826
claiming they're innocent,

02:07.828 --> 02:10.863
investigating new leads -

02:10.865 --> 02:12.865
gets everybody in here riled up.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.917
It gives them false hope.

02:14.919 --> 02:18.253
And in here,
hope is a dangerous thing.

02:18.255 --> 02:20.956
- Except I am innocent.
- So am I.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.958
Nobody cares.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.460
The cops said
I murdered somebody.

02:25.462 --> 02:29.765
They said they "couldn't find"
my alibi witness. My lawyer

02:29.767 --> 02:32.684
told me that I'd be
out of here in a week.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.304
That was five years ago.

02:35.306 --> 02:37.639
I lost my job,

02:37.641 --> 02:40.692
then I lost my house,

02:40.694 --> 02:42.694
and eventually

02:42.696 --> 02:44.563
my daughter too.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.698
I don't even know
what she looks like now.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.984
- I'm sorry.
- Like I said,

02:48.986 --> 02:51.653
nobody cares. Not them, not me.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.991
Makes it easier all around.

02:55.993 --> 02:58.577
Well, I don't do easy.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.246
Well...

03:01.248 --> 03:04.299
then you and I

03:04.301 --> 03:06.919
are going to have a problem.

03:11.926 --> 03:14.676
And yesterday,
someone swore at me in Italian.

03:14.678 --> 03:17.396
That's great, honey.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.068
Nothing. I'm just tired.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.354
Angie and I were up all night

03:25.356 --> 03:28.407
on a stakeout.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.693
Yeah, honey, I will.

03:31.695 --> 03:33.579
We'll talk soon, alright?
Love you.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.450
When are you planning
on telling her?

03:38.452 --> 03:42.454
- She doesn't need to know about this, Dad.
- Yeah.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.873
Is that what I think it is?

03:44.875 --> 03:47.626
I don't know what else to do.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.095
They're holding Angie
on a million-dollar bond.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.997
Yeah, well,

03:51.999 --> 03:54.016
I don't have the answer
to that question, son.

03:55.803 --> 04:00.055
But from where I stand,
Angie is more than worth it.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.483
Everett, front and center.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.369
- What's going on?
- You won the lottery.

04:26.917 --> 04:28.098
Shade, how did you...?

04:28.123 --> 04:30.836
- Does it matter? You're out!
- My bail was set

04:30.838 --> 04:32.971
at a million dollars; Where did
you get that kind of money?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.840
I took back a few beer cans,

04:34.842 --> 04:38.176
looked under the sofa cushions.
Do you know that you had

04:38.178 --> 04:41.563
- $200 in pesos in your desk?
- My God. You didn't.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.684
- What? It's just a house.
- It's so much more than that.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.603
- I needed my partner back.
- Besides, we'll be fine

04:48.605 --> 04:50.822
as long as you don't violate
the conditions of your parole,

04:50.824 --> 04:53.909
which means a daily check-in,
a 9 p.m. curfew,

04:53.911 --> 04:56.578
and you're not allowed to leave
your house unless I'm with you.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.747
I'm going back inside.

04:58.749 --> 05:00.999
I would if I was you.

05:01.001 --> 05:04.169
- So, fill me in, partner.
- What's the latest?

05:04.171 --> 05:06.171
Zoe and I have been
working all the angles.

05:06.173 --> 05:10.092
Dana and Dominic are pros.
They do this all over the world.

05:10.094 --> 05:13.295
Well, sure, but there's
gotta be something, right?

05:13.297 --> 05:15.380
CCTV of her
handing me the drive?

05:15.382 --> 05:17.933
- Doesn't exist.
- The car she was driving?

05:17.935 --> 05:19.968
A rental. Fake name.

05:19.970 --> 05:23.305
Well, what about her
cellphone? Asthma inhaler?

05:23.307 --> 05:25.357
Maybe there's a prescription.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.559
Shade, it's been three days.
Dana, Dominic could be anywhere

05:27.561 --> 05:29.695
by now. If we don't find them
or recover that drive, then...

05:29.697 --> 05:33.281
- We will. Don't worry.
- How can you be so sure?

05:37.321 --> 05:40.906
You gotta be kidding me!
Is that Ellis?

05:47.164 --> 05:51.116
Seriously, Agent Ellis?
Didn't get your fill last time?

05:51.118 --> 05:53.719
This doesn't stop 'til
I'm holding that drive, Shade.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.222
We already told you, we don't have it.
Dana does.

05:56.247 --> 05:57.222
Or her partner.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.224
Enough with the Dana
and Dominic garbage.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.476
Do you have any idea
what was on that drive?

06:01.478 --> 06:06.848
Top secret data on every military
intelligence asset in the world.

06:06.850 --> 06:08.539
You put a lot of
people's lives at risk.

06:08.564 --> 06:09.651
So, why aren't you out

06:09.653 --> 06:10.670
looking for the real criminals?

06:10.694 --> 06:12.320
The real criminals, yeah.
I spoke to the people

06:12.322 --> 06:15.490
at Summit Path about them.
You know what they told me?

06:15.492 --> 06:17.492
Nothing.

06:17.494 --> 06:20.078
Not one person
had ever seen them.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.747
Same thing at the rink.
No photos,

06:21.749 --> 06:24.583
no emails, you don't even know
their real names.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.952
We're all through in there, sir.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.821
Good. Pack it up.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.590
Pack it up!

06:31.592 --> 06:34.659
So, you guys wanna
waste my time?

06:34.661 --> 06:37.495
You wanna play games? It's fine.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.881
You got a trial coming up,
and when that's done

06:39.883 --> 06:42.384
you're gonna spend
the next 20 years of your life

06:42.386 --> 06:44.636
behind bars.

07:30.767 --> 07:33.435
- No, no, no!
- Don't come in yet!

07:33.437 --> 07:37.072
- The other letters are here.
- It's OK, Zoe.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.080
Don't listen
to that Ellis guy, OK?

07:45.082 --> 07:46.948
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

07:46.950 --> 07:49.751
He's right, though. You guys
have exhausted every lead,

07:49.753 --> 07:52.037
and Dana and Dominic
are still ghosts.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.789
I mean, if we don't find that
drive, and somehow convince Dana

07:54.791 --> 07:56.925
- to confess that she set me up...
- We will. We will.

07:56.927 --> 07:58.710
All it takes is one lead.

08:00.264 --> 08:01.463
Maz!

08:03.600 --> 08:07.052
- Look who's here!
- Yeah, yeah, welcome back.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.221
Rein it in, buddy.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.439
Couldn't meet you
at the station.

08:11.441 --> 08:13.441
The place is crawling with Feds.

08:13.443 --> 08:15.944
- You got something?
- Maybe.

08:15.946 --> 08:18.730
Probably not. Just promise me
you won't get your hopes up.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.866
- Not anymore.
- What is it?

08:20.868 --> 08:22.734
Woman was caught on camera
smashing a car window

08:22.736 --> 08:24.986
- and stealing a laptop.
- Is it Dana?

08:24.988 --> 08:27.072
Her name is Beth. She works
at a women's shelter downtown.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.374
- I don't see the connection.
- Look, she's at the Red Bird.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.876
You're gonna want
to hear her story. Just...

08:30.878 --> 08:33.328
- Don't get my hopes up.
- Exactly.

08:34.831 --> 08:36.831
When she first came

08:36.832 --> 08:39.616
into the shelter, I couldn't
get her to stop crying.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.386
She said her name was Tina.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.472
I took her in,
same as I would anyone else.

08:44.474 --> 08:48.009
And I remember thinking she
looked just like my kid sister -

08:48.011 --> 08:50.061
blonde, blue eyes -

08:50.063 --> 08:52.647
and they both have asthma.
- She had an inhaler?

08:52.649 --> 08:54.266
Yeah.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.935
So once she calmed down,
we got to talking,

08:56.937 --> 08:59.938
and she told me that her
boyfriend had stolen her laptop.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.157
Let me guess. She wanted you
to go get it back for her?

09:02.159 --> 09:05.228
She said she would have done
it herself, but she was too afraid.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.079
So she gave me the address of his gym,
said that he went there every Tuesday.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.648
- Do you know where Tina is now?
- I gave her the laptop

09:10.650 --> 09:13.702
when I got back to the shelter.
She left that same night.

09:13.704 --> 09:15.704
Said she was going
to her mother's.

09:15.706 --> 09:18.673
I didn't think anything of it
until the police arrived.

09:18.675 --> 09:22.677
I feel so stupid, you know.
I was just trying to help.

09:22.679 --> 09:26.131
Would you excuse us
for one second?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.269
- It's gotta be Dana.
- What did I say

09:31.271 --> 09:33.021
- about getting your hopes up?
- She pulled the exact same scam

09:33.023 --> 09:34.606
on Beth as she did on me.
And the asthma?

09:34.608 --> 09:36.691
- Whose laptop did she steal?
- Guy by the name

09:36.693 --> 09:38.860
of Dalton Yi. Head of security
for a company called.

09:38.862 --> 09:41.062
Centro-Guard. Talked to him,
we didn't really get much.

09:41.064 --> 09:43.281
The head of a security company
left his laptop in his car?

09:43.283 --> 09:45.283
Yeah. You'd get it
if you met him.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.035
I don't like to brag,

09:47.037 --> 09:49.404
but you don't get to be
Toronto's premier provider

09:49.406 --> 09:51.456
of security solutions
without being smarter

09:51.458 --> 09:53.491
than your average bear.

09:53.493 --> 09:56.411
And how smart is
your average bear these days?

09:59.633 --> 10:01.549
Thanks.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.670
So, are you guys
local cops or...?

10:05.672 --> 10:08.089
- Feds.
- Yes.

10:08.091 --> 10:10.725
What we mean is
we are federal agents

10:10.727 --> 10:13.211
on assignment to
the local division.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.014
There's a huge
national crackdown

10:16.016 --> 10:19.818
- on fitness-club theft.
- OK, cool.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.736
What exactly is it you do here?

10:21.738 --> 10:24.906
Design and build
cutting-edge security systems.

10:24.908 --> 10:28.910
Doors, locks, sensors,
biometrics, everything custom.

10:28.912 --> 10:32.330
And who are your clients?

10:32.332 --> 10:34.866
I can't call myself
a security expert

10:34.868 --> 10:37.369
- and tell you that.
- Come on, what's the harm?

10:37.371 --> 10:39.254
I mean, can't trust the Feds,
who can you trust?

10:40.841 --> 10:44.125
OK, fine. We did
a full security overhaul

10:44.127 --> 10:47.245
- of the Landon Museum.
- The Landon?

10:47.247 --> 10:49.764
Was there anything sensitive
on your laptop

10:49.766 --> 10:51.749
that thieves may
have been interested in?

10:51.751 --> 10:54.102
Information about
the museum's security setup?

10:54.104 --> 10:57.105
I mean, sure, technically,
you could use our laptop

10:57.107 --> 11:00.058
to access the network,
but you'd need, like,

11:00.060 --> 11:03.812
grandmaster-level hacking skills
to crack my password.

11:06.283 --> 11:07.982
Mr. Shade! Hi!

11:07.984 --> 11:10.902
So sorry to keep you waiting.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.204
I must confess
I have never followed hockey,

11:13.206 --> 11:15.240
but my husband
is your biggest fan.

11:15.242 --> 11:18.076
- Thank you.
- Najma Hammoud.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.295
I'm the curator here
at the Landon Museum.

11:20.297 --> 11:23.748
Come, let me show you the exhibit
that's getting set up right now.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.334
I am so pleased that you want
to donate to the museum.

11:26.336 --> 11:28.586
Your timing is perfect.

11:28.588 --> 11:32.140
We're setting up for a big gala
for all of our patrons.

11:32.142 --> 11:34.726
A private viewing
of our new exhibit

11:34.728 --> 11:38.129
A collection of rare artifacts
from the Hermitage Museum.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.148
In exchange,
we are loaning them pieces

11:40.150 --> 11:42.183
from our permanent collection.

11:42.185 --> 11:45.236
- This is incredible.
- It's a katana sword

11:45.238 --> 11:48.022
of the Muromachi period.
Utterly priceless.

11:48.024 --> 11:51.109
- How much are we talking?
- Suffice it to say

11:51.111 --> 11:53.828
we had to purchase an additional
20 million of insurance

11:53.830 --> 11:55.864
just to host the exhibition.

11:55.866 --> 11:58.083
If you'll excuse me.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.418
20-million dollar sword?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.337
Yeah, history just got a lot

12:02.339 --> 12:04.205
more interesting.

12:04.207 --> 12:06.424
Honey bear, do you remember

12:06.426 --> 12:08.426
the name of that woman
we met that dealt

12:08.428 --> 12:10.378
with Japanese artifacts?
Remember?

12:10.380 --> 12:12.163
Slender, blonde hair, blue eyes?

12:12.165 --> 12:15.100
- Right. Had an asthma inhaler.
- It sure would be nice

12:15.102 --> 12:17.915
to see her again. Does
any of that ring a bell?

12:17.940 --> 12:18.853
Sorry, no.

12:18.855 --> 12:21.172
Wait, she had
a colleague too, right?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.108
Tall, blue eyes,
sandy blonde hair.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.143
Maybe drives a blue sports car?

12:25.145 --> 12:27.946
- You must mean Mr. Rudolph.
- Mr. Rudolph...

12:27.948 --> 12:31.399
- Here. Yeah.
- "Octavio," right!

12:31.401 --> 12:33.782
That's his name! When
do you expect him again?

12:33.807 --> 12:35.403
Tomorrow night at the gala.

12:35.405 --> 12:37.956
- Shall I tell him you're looking for him?
- No, no, that's OK.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.825
We prefer to see his face
when we surprise him.

12:43.747 --> 12:45.663
What am I missing? What's so
special about a blue sports car?

12:45.665 --> 12:47.749
The day after you got
arrested, Zoe and I canvassed

12:47.751 --> 12:49.751
witnesses near the site.
Several people said they saw

12:49.753 --> 12:51.920
a man and a woman drive away
in a blue sports car.

12:51.922 --> 12:53.905
At the time, it didn't
lead anywhere.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.541
Now, it's a direct path
to our ghosts.

13:09.689 --> 13:13.057
Angie, do not come here, OK?

13:13.059 --> 13:15.193
Seriously? Life in the balance
here, Maz.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.812
Do you not remember what I told
you earlier? Hi. How are you doing?

13:17.814 --> 13:19.814
There's Feds all over
this place, OK? Really.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.735
We know he's a phony.
It's gotta be Dominic.

13:23.737 --> 13:26.571
We just need you to run a quick vehicle
search. I will take two minutes.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.874
- Alright, give me a second.
- Hey, guys,

13:29.876 --> 13:32.160
did you hear? Impound just
brought in a donut truck.

13:32.162 --> 13:33.828
There's like 20 fresh boxes
in the kitchen.

13:33.830 --> 13:36.664
- Yeah.
- I would run. I would hurry.

13:39.169 --> 13:41.836
- Alright, what do you need?
- I texted you the info.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.457
OK, I got

13:46.459 --> 13:49.010
97 ownership registrations
for a blue sports car.

13:49.012 --> 13:51.763
How many men?

13:51.765 --> 13:54.682
- 68.
- Any way to narrow that down?

13:54.684 --> 13:57.819
- Not without more information.
- OK. Thanks, Maz.

13:57.821 --> 14:01.072
You're welcome. It's nice to get
a thank you every once in a while.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.775
- What are we gonna do?
- We can't look into 68 owners.

14:03.777 --> 14:06.194
- Maybe we don't have to.
- Think about it,

14:06.196 --> 14:08.196
if Dana and Dominic do this
all over the world,

14:08.198 --> 14:10.582
- why would they own a car here?
- What's your point?

14:10.584 --> 14:12.584
My point is,
back in my playing days,

14:12.586 --> 14:14.419
when me and the boys would
land in a new city

14:14.421 --> 14:16.421
and want a piece of flash
to ride around in,

14:16.423 --> 14:19.173
we'd hit up the local
exotic-car rental agency.

14:19.175 --> 14:21.509
You and I are literally
from different planets.

14:21.511 --> 14:23.545
Call Zoe.

14:28.385 --> 14:30.935
- Ellis?
- Yeah. He's been tailing me

14:30.937 --> 14:33.021
for three days.
Can you lose him?

14:33.023 --> 14:34.939
Sorry I asked.

14:51.575 --> 14:52.907
Damn it!

14:55.996 --> 14:58.296
I called every rental agency
in the city.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.415
The last woman I talked to
knew who Mr. Rudolph was.

15:02.419 --> 15:05.670
And?-

15:05.672 --> 15:07.839
but all the cars
have a GPS locator.

15:07.841 --> 15:10.892
And according to that, it's
parked at the Dovercourt Hotel.

15:12.646 --> 15:16.314
- Is this it?
- I don't know.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.600
The witness I talked to
just said "blue sports car."

15:18.602 --> 15:22.153
We need a way
to get him down here.

15:31.698 --> 15:32.607
What are you doing?!

15:32.632 --> 15:34.532
We tell the guy at front
desk we backed in it.

15:34.557 --> 15:36.514
He'll page the owner;
We see who comes down.

15:36.539 --> 15:37.539
I like it.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.956
- What?
- I can't do it. Too beautiful.

15:41.958 --> 15:44.208
- My God! Give me this.
- No, wait!

15:44.210 --> 15:46.961
- What now?
- We don't really have to do it.

15:46.963 --> 15:49.714
We just have to tell the guy
at the front desk we did.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.883
Good point.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.896
- Hello, Dominic.
- Shade! Buddy...

16:07.567 --> 16:09.534
That was immensely satisfying.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.569
Let's get him in the car.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.623
OK. As soon as he wakes up,
we'll find out

16:15.625 --> 16:17.625
- what he's doing at the museum.
- OK.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.413
Well, I hope it leads us
to the drive.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.215
My God! It's Ellis!

16:29.806 --> 16:31.889
Ms. Everett.

16:35.345 --> 16:38.096
That was a nice piece
of driving back there.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.649
Apparently not nice enough. What
are you doing here, Sergeant?

16:41.651 --> 16:43.317
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

16:43.319 --> 16:45.653
- Me?
- I was here for the spa.

16:45.655 --> 16:48.573
Needed a little rubdown
after those prison beds.

16:49.859 --> 16:51.826
Where's Mr. Shade?

16:51.828 --> 16:54.278
He just left.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.280
He, he just left.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.199
A reaction to the facial peel.

16:58.201 --> 17:01.452
- You care to rethink that one?
- What do you mean?

17:01.454 --> 17:04.288
He's supposed to accompany you
whenever you're out of the house.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.125
Part of your bail conditions,
remember?

17:07.127 --> 17:09.127
Yeah.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.877
You see, we had an emergency

17:10.880 --> 17:14.515
at the agency. Zoe got
a stapler stuck in the...

17:14.517 --> 17:16.300
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.553
I will call him right now
to come get me.

17:18.555 --> 17:21.271
- Don't bother.
- I'll give you a ride.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.891
- Come on, don't do that.
- Please. I just made a mistake.

17:23.893 --> 17:27.278
You're under arrest for breach
of recognizance. Turn!

17:27.280 --> 17:28.980
Hands.

17:35.238 --> 17:37.705
This way.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.928
This will make sure
you don't leave the building.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.764
- How does that feel?
- Is that a real question?

17:46.766 --> 17:48.850
Do me a favour
and walk to the door.

17:53.639 --> 17:56.691
OK, I'll give you
a couple of extra feet

17:56.693 --> 17:59.026
- so you don't accidentally...
- She's good.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.459
- No! No!
- Sleep!

18:18.014 --> 18:20.798
- You're a real piece of work.
- Just because she's the one

18:20.800 --> 18:23.601
with the ankle bracelet doesn't
mean you're in the clear.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.803
I know you were
at Summit Path that night.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.855
As soon as I find that drive,
I'm coming after you too.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.057
How many times do we have
to tell you, we don't have it?

18:30.059 --> 18:32.059
See, the problem is
I know you're lying.

18:32.061 --> 18:34.395
You know, those eggheads
at Summit Path,

18:34.397 --> 18:37.231
they embedded a piece of code
in the drive's startup routine.

18:37.233 --> 18:40.318
It alerts them whenever
somebody tries to access it.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.453
- And no one has?
- Not yet.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.656
Which means there's still
a chance that I can save

18:45.658 --> 18:47.825
some of the thousands of lives
you put at risk.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.329
Enjoy your new cell.

19:02.425 --> 19:05.927
Hey, Zoe.

19:05.929 --> 19:09.096
- We good?
- Yep. Bring him in.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.685
- Where's the hard drive?
- I have no idea

19:14.687 --> 19:17.155
what you're talking about!

19:17.157 --> 19:19.273
- He thinks we're recording him.
- Maybe we should

19:19.275 --> 19:21.325
- just turn him in to Ellis.
- Wouldn't do any good.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.647
There's nothing to tie him to me, and
it would just be his word against ours.

19:29.002 --> 19:32.420
Driver's license,
credit card, coffee card...

19:32.422 --> 19:34.956
I will take that.

19:34.958 --> 19:37.208
Room key.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.627
Maybe this'll tell us something
even if you won't.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.347
Now, all we have to do
is figure out what room

19:43.349 --> 19:46.434
he's staying in. Zoe?

19:48.855 --> 19:51.355
- Room 400.
- Thank you so much!

19:51.357 --> 19:54.976
Mr. Rudolph here gets
a little forgetful when he's had

19:54.978 --> 19:58.029
- too much to drink.
- I don't even know what city this is!

19:58.031 --> 20:00.114
- Wait!
- You never showed me any ID.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.699
- God.
- Give it to you later!

20:03.536 --> 20:05.502
How long before you
think he figures it out?

20:05.527 --> 20:06.880
Not long enough. Let's go!

20:10.043 --> 20:12.076
How long are you planning
on keeping me here?

20:12.078 --> 20:15.713
That depends on when
you just had to start talking.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.883
You realize we're in this together, right?
You know I can't take you to Ellis.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.302
And the fact that you're tied up
means anything you say can be

20:21.304 --> 20:24.805
- explained away as coercion.
- OK.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.891
- What do you want to know?
- Where's the drive?

20:26.893 --> 20:29.594
- Moscow.
- Unless the buyer moved it.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.396
That's funny. The Feds say
no one's accessed it yet.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.599
- I just deliver the goods.
- I don't tell 'em

20:34.601 --> 20:36.901
- what to do with it.
- Really? Then what are you

20:36.903 --> 20:40.605
still doing here?
What's happening at the museum?

20:43.109 --> 20:45.109
We didn't mean
for you to be arrested.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.411
You know that, right?

20:47.413 --> 20:50.164
- Is it the katana sword?
- Just doing a cash deal?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.700
Dana felt terrible about it.

20:52.702 --> 20:55.670
I mean, to a point. She's not
exactly famous for her warmth.

20:55.672 --> 20:59.290
- And where's Dana now?
- You're wasting your time.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.793
Ten years I've been working with
her, no one's even gotten close.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.845
Sooner or later
everybody screws up.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.847
Not her.

21:06.849 --> 21:09.717
If you want my help, let me hook
you up with my passport guy.

21:09.719 --> 21:11.686
- Give it up.
- You could be

21:11.688 --> 21:14.388
on a plane tonight,
put all this behind you.

21:14.390 --> 21:16.357
I'm not running.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.225
You see, that's
the problem, Angie.

21:18.227 --> 21:20.111
You still think
you're getting out of this.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.896
Thing is

21:21.898 --> 21:23.948
you've already lost.

21:25.952 --> 21:26.869
Find anything?

21:26.894 --> 21:29.644
He likes to get
his "Wild Kingdom" on!

21:36.245 --> 21:38.245
Hold on,
I might have found something.

21:41.250 --> 21:43.217
What is it?

21:43.219 --> 21:46.036
I have no idea,

21:46.038 --> 21:49.223
but I'll bet you
Mr. Rudolph does.

21:59.068 --> 22:01.152
Dana!

22:01.154 --> 22:03.070
Hey! Hey!

22:24.293 --> 22:26.877
Taxi!

22:37.640 --> 22:40.358
Hey! Hey!

22:40.360 --> 22:43.277
Don't!

22:51.754 --> 22:55.473
- Dana was right there. I let her get away.
- It's not your fault. At least

22:55.475 --> 22:57.641
- we know she's still here.
- You mean was.

22:57.643 --> 22:59.810
That little incident probably
scared her off for good.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.846
- OK. Thank you.
- Car will be fixed

23:01.848 --> 23:03.931
in half an hour. What now?

23:03.933 --> 23:06.434
It would really help if
we knew what this thing was for.

23:06.436 --> 23:10.104
Zoe, send a picture of that to the
Centro-Guard guy. See if he recognizes it.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.224
- Alright.
- Gala starts in an hour.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.778
If Dana really wants that sword, it would
be her best opportunity to take it.

23:17.780 --> 23:20.247
How is she gonna steal it
in a crowd of people?

23:20.249 --> 23:22.917
- Diversion. It's their M.O.
- Get everyone focused

23:22.919 --> 23:25.002
on one thing while they do
something else.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.121
Like playing on our sympathies
to take a hard drive.

23:27.123 --> 23:29.457
Or making up a phony
puck story to split you two up.

23:29.459 --> 23:32.626
- Can we order a pizza?!
- My treat!

23:32.628 --> 23:35.463
For all we know,
he may be the diversion

23:35.465 --> 23:38.248
to keep us away from the gala.
Zoe, we're gonna check it out.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.184
- Wait, "we"?
- Yeah.

23:40.186 --> 23:42.052
I'm gonna need backup,
and Angie's stuck here.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.438
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I can't play a rich person.

23:44.440 --> 23:47.525
Champagne makes me sneeze,
and I hate tiny dogs!

23:47.527 --> 23:49.226
- Come on, Duchess.
- Let's get you dressed.

23:49.228 --> 23:52.229
- OK. Do I need an accent?
- Maybe taller hair?

23:52.231 --> 23:54.899
I will not eat fish eggs.
I will eat fondue.

23:56.953 --> 24:00.121
This is a terrible idea.

24:00.123 --> 24:03.273
- Would you relax?
- It's easy for you to say!

24:03.275 --> 24:05.326
You're not 15 feet
off the ground.

24:05.328 --> 24:07.611
Mr. Shade,

24:07.613 --> 24:09.663
- so good of you to come.
- Thank you.

24:09.665 --> 24:12.115
And thanks for the tickets.
My wife sends her regrets.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.552
- This is...
- Zoe Von Fursten... Berg...

24:14.554 --> 24:18.121
Dorf... Goodman.

24:18.123 --> 24:21.759
I have a company
that makes me oodles of money.

24:21.761 --> 24:25.312
OK. Well, make sure
you're here for the unveiling

24:25.314 --> 24:28.098
of the katana sword.
It's at 9 p.m. sharp.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.100
Alright, thank you.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.820
- OK. Hahaha!
- Tata!

24:32.822 --> 24:35.356
What the hell is wrong with you?

24:35.358 --> 24:37.408
I told you
I'm no good at being rich!

24:37.410 --> 24:40.027
How about just being human?

24:40.029 --> 24:42.279
Look. Take this.

24:42.281 --> 24:45.366
Go over there and stand next
to that stage.

24:45.368 --> 24:48.502
If you see anything unusual,
contact me right away. And just

24:48.504 --> 24:51.038
try to act normal, OK?

24:51.040 --> 24:52.873
- You got this.
- OK.

24:58.848 --> 25:00.848
You're never

25:00.850 --> 25:04.885
- gonna get into that.
- Really?

25:06.689 --> 25:09.640
Fingerprint scan.

25:09.642 --> 25:11.559
Technology's the best!

25:11.561 --> 25:13.881
Doesn't matter. You're still
not gonna get anything.

25:16.482 --> 25:19.366
Data-scrubbing app.
Need a secondary code.

25:19.368 --> 25:21.485
Technology is the best.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.709
What's your deal
with Dana anyway?

25:28.711 --> 25:31.161
- Why are you protecting her?
- She took me in

25:31.163 --> 25:33.163
when I was nothing.
Made me who I am.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.583
- A criminal?
- I was always a criminal;

25:35.585 --> 25:38.419
- She just made me a good one.
- You say that with pride.

25:38.421 --> 25:41.589
That's the difference between
criminals and normal folk.

25:41.591 --> 25:44.174
Criminals don't care that people
think they're criminals.

25:44.176 --> 25:46.393
You got a text.

25:46.395 --> 25:49.980
It says "Gambit."
That's our kill code.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.882
- "Kill code"?
- I didn't check in.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.486
If I don't reply in the next five minutes,
Dana calls off the entire operation.

25:55.488 --> 25:59.073
You mean stealing
the katana sword?

25:59.075 --> 26:02.276
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

26:02.278 --> 26:03.944
It needs a specific word.

26:03.946 --> 26:06.163
Don't suppose I could
convince you to give it to me.

26:06.165 --> 26:09.250
Not without some major
concessions on your part.

26:15.958 --> 26:18.876
- Shade, come in.
- Zoe, what's up?

26:18.878 --> 26:20.377
I heard from
the Centro-Guard guy

26:23.549 --> 26:26.583
but all their fobs are encrypted
in-house with a 40-bit code.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.853
The one Dominic has isn't one
of his, but it could be a copy.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.772
It's why they stole the laptop

26:31.774 --> 26:33.724
To make a homemade version.
Where's the sword now?

26:33.726 --> 26:35.809
Still under wraps.

26:35.811 --> 26:38.362
- It's almost 9 o'clock.
- If Dana was gonna make a move,

26:38.364 --> 26:40.364
you'd think she would
have made it by now.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.570
Stay alert.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.911
There you are.

26:53.913 --> 26:56.463
Been looking all over for you.

26:56.465 --> 26:59.300
Someone likes it rough.

26:59.302 --> 27:01.468
You got a lot of nerve
showing up here. Let's go.

27:01.470 --> 27:05.222
If you're planning on taking
me outside, I'd suggest you find

27:05.224 --> 27:07.975
- a more subtle way of doing it.
- I was never one for subtle.

27:07.977 --> 27:11.395
There are 15 security guards
standing around.

27:11.397 --> 27:14.264
Do you really want to see
what happens when I scream?

27:17.103 --> 27:19.486
Fine. We'll wait,

27:19.488 --> 27:22.356
considering we've got
your partner.

27:24.660 --> 27:26.994
You know, my offer still stands.

27:26.996 --> 27:28.912
I can get my passport guy
on the phone

27:28.914 --> 27:30.831
in 10 minutes,
and I'll sweeten the deal.

27:30.833 --> 27:32.499
I have $40,000 in cash

27:32.501 --> 27:34.201
in my rental car. It's yours

27:34.203 --> 27:36.086
- if you let me go.
- You're bargaining.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.623
- You must be desperate.
- I'm trying to help you.

27:39.625 --> 27:42.659
You seem like a nice person,
I'd hate you to spend the next,

27:42.661 --> 27:45.796
- what? 15 to 20 years in prison?
- Just forget it, OK?

27:45.798 --> 27:49.299
- I'm not letting you go.
- Why do you care so much

27:49.301 --> 27:52.553
about a stupid Japanese dagger?

27:56.859 --> 27:59.727
It's a katana sword
from the Muromachi period.

27:59.729 --> 28:02.446
Same same.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.565
Where's the hard drive?

28:04.567 --> 28:07.618
My guess? The Golyanovo
District of Moscow.

28:07.620 --> 28:10.404
- You sold it to the Russian mob?
- It's just business.

28:10.406 --> 28:13.540
So what are your plans
for the sword?

28:13.542 --> 28:16.043
Guess you're gonna miss out
on that $20 million payday.

28:16.045 --> 28:18.045
Unless you took it already.

28:20.383 --> 28:23.967
Well, I guess we're about
to find out, aren't we?

28:26.305 --> 28:29.339
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention,

28:29.341 --> 28:33.010
please. It's the moment
you've all been waiting for.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.145
Come join me.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.481
Come closer, please.

28:37.483 --> 28:41.151
May I present the one of a kind,

28:41.153 --> 28:44.188
priceless Muromachi sword.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.857
Shade, look. The same key.

28:55.618 --> 28:57.334
Shade, the sword's still here.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.787
That's my cue.

28:59.789 --> 29:02.923
- Let me go!
- Hey, is there a problem?

29:02.925 --> 29:05.100
Yes. This man is trying
to drag me to his car.

29:05.125 --> 29:06.234
Sir, let go of her.

29:07.763 --> 29:11.215
Angie, I get it.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.350
It feels wrong to run,

29:13.352 --> 29:16.053
but even if you catch Dana -
which you won't -

29:16.055 --> 29:18.555
she'll never confess
to setting you up.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.892
And the cops have you on video.
There's is no version of this

29:21.894 --> 29:24.194
where you don't
end up in prison.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.146
Pick up, Shade.

29:26.148 --> 29:29.783
- Sir, you're coming with us!
- Sorry it had to end this way.

29:31.987 --> 29:34.071
- This is Matt Shade.
- Leave a message.

29:38.794 --> 29:42.496
- Are you sure there's money in your car?
- Grey duffel bag. Take my keys.

29:54.810 --> 29:57.060
You better be telling the truth.

30:00.850 --> 30:03.400
Yeah, OK, OK.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.604
Zoe, I could use
a diversion right now.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.907
Boy.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.909
Amazing!

30:11.911 --> 30:14.328
Look out!

30:14.330 --> 30:16.580
- I'm so sorry!
- Code red!

30:16.582 --> 30:18.999
Code red in gala mezzanine.

30:19.001 --> 30:21.001
- It's fine.
- It's fine. It's fine.

30:21.003 --> 30:24.338
- Ma'am, come here. Ma'am.
- I'm rich, it's OK.

30:32.515 --> 30:34.965
- Where the hell have you been?
- I'm almost there.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.134
I can't believe
you let yourself get captured.

30:39.104 --> 30:42.055
And Angie's under house arrest.
Or at least she was.

30:42.057 --> 30:45.142
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I convinced her to take door number two.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.194
She's running?

30:47.196 --> 30:49.813
See you in five.

30:49.815 --> 30:52.282
Angie, what's up?

30:52.284 --> 30:54.785
I tried calling you.

30:54.787 --> 30:56.737
Here. Dana was here,
but I lost her.

30:56.739 --> 30:59.239
- I had to let Dominic go.
- What?!

30:59.241 --> 31:01.325
Dana sent a kill code, OK?

31:01.327 --> 31:03.627
They were gonna scrap the whole
thing. My bet is Dominic

31:03.629 --> 31:06.296
- is on his way to you right now.
- Angie, slow down.

31:10.252 --> 31:12.553
The sword is a diversion,
Shade. Think about it.

31:12.555 --> 31:14.704
Why would they stick around
after stealing top-secret

31:14.706 --> 31:17.641
government data? I mean, why has
no one accessed the drive?

31:20.596 --> 31:22.679
It means they still have it.

31:22.681 --> 31:25.732
At least for now.

31:25.734 --> 31:28.101
The Hermitage Museum,
it's in Russia.

31:31.023 --> 31:34.107
They're using the outbound shipment to
smuggle the hard drive out of the country.

31:34.109 --> 31:36.159
Well, you need
to stop it, Shade.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.561
Thousands of lives are at stake.
I put a GPS tracker

31:38.563 --> 31:40.530
on Dominic's phone.
I just sent you the link.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.369
- You're a genius.
- OK, sit tight.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.371
What is it?

31:50.709 --> 31:53.176
There's something else
I need to tell you.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.851
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- I'll take it from here.

32:00.853 --> 32:02.769
Where's the fob?

32:02.771 --> 32:04.605
Hello to you too.

32:04.607 --> 32:06.523
- Don't get cute.
- Where's the drive?

32:10.529 --> 32:12.863
Let's do this.

32:22.074 --> 32:23.957
Hey, did a blonde woman
come through here?

32:23.959 --> 32:25.876
Yeah, you just missed her.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.735
- Come in, Zoe.
- What's going on?

32:51.737 --> 32:53.389
Dominic just left here
with the hard drive.

32:53.413 --> 32:54.438
Dominic was here?

32:54.440 --> 32:56.573
Yeah. Call Maz. Get him
to scramble a roadblock unit.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.525
I'll send him the location.

32:58.527 --> 33:00.027
- Is Angie OK?
- Just do it!

33:51.180 --> 33:53.814
Son of a bitch!

34:02.858 --> 34:05.609
- Hands where I can see 'em!
- Hands in the air, let's go!

34:07.830 --> 34:11.081
Keep 'em there! No big moves!
Go ahead, go ahead!

34:11.083 --> 34:14.451
- Shade, stay back, stay back!
- Get out of the vehicle!

34:14.453 --> 34:16.753
- I don't know what's going on.
- I'm just the driver.

34:16.755 --> 34:19.422
- Save it. Cuff him.
- Check his pocket. There's a fob.

34:23.378 --> 34:25.962
- Let's get out his plaque.
- You better be right about this.

34:41.563 --> 34:43.362
Shade, be careful.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.127
Take it easy, those are
priceless artifacts!

34:48.152 --> 34:49.152
Trust me.

34:51.956 --> 34:53.956
Is that the hard drive
they say Angie stole?

34:53.958 --> 34:55.909
One and the same.

34:57.746 --> 35:00.747
Now, there's one more favour
I gotta ask of you.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.174
I want to be wheels up
in three minutes.

35:11.176 --> 35:13.176
Yes, Ma'am.

35:33.081 --> 35:36.283
- Angie.
- Relax, I just want to talk.

35:36.285 --> 35:38.869
Well, I'm flattered,

35:38.871 --> 35:42.205
but, I'm afraid
I don't have a lot of time.

35:42.207 --> 35:45.792
- Take me with you!
- Excuse me?

35:45.794 --> 35:48.762
- There's $40,000 in that bag.
- It's all yours.

35:50.632 --> 35:53.016
I'm never gonna beat
that charge.

35:53.018 --> 35:55.101
My life's over.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.690
Pull up your pant leg.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.063
- Police!
- - Police!

36:07.065 --> 36:09.649
Keep the right side.

36:09.651 --> 36:12.319
Check the office.

36:12.321 --> 36:14.988
- It's clear.
- - All clear.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.242
Yes, sir!

36:22.664 --> 36:24.581
All clear!

36:32.925 --> 36:34.925
Let's go!

36:34.927 --> 36:37.394
I'm not asking to tag along
forever. Just take me wherever

36:37.396 --> 36:39.095
you're going tonight, and
I'll figure it out from there.

36:39.097 --> 36:41.097
What about Shade?

36:41.099 --> 36:43.433
- The Feds are after him too.
- They've got nothing on him.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.735
This is your fault!

36:45.737 --> 36:48.688
You hired me to steal that drive
and now I'm facing 20 years!

36:48.690 --> 36:51.775
The least you could do is
get me out of the country.

36:57.699 --> 37:00.083
- Angie!
- You can't stop me, Shade.

37:00.085 --> 37:01.952
No, you don't have
to do this. Look.

37:01.954 --> 37:04.621
I've got the hard drive.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.923
- Where's Dominic?
- The police have him.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.709
- It's over, Dana!
- No,

37:09.711 --> 37:11.711
not for me.
I have a flight to catch.

37:11.713 --> 37:14.681
And what's your client gonna say
when you turn up without the goods?

37:14.683 --> 37:16.716
From I hear, the Russian mafia
is not very forgiving.

37:16.718 --> 37:20.220
- It's not enough, Shade.
- I'm still gonna go back to jail!

37:20.222 --> 37:22.138
You don't know that.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.140
We've got the hard drive now,
we can use it as leverage.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.693
- It won't work!
- Just give it to me!

37:28.313 --> 37:32.032
- Have you lost your mind?
- Where did you get that gun?!

37:32.034 --> 37:35.151
- I'm not kidding, OK?
- I'm not going back there!

37:35.153 --> 37:37.153
Just relax, OK?

37:37.155 --> 37:39.789
We're a team,
we'll figure this out.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.826
- Just put the gun down.
- This is your last chance.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.828
Don't do this.

37:44.830 --> 37:47.080
I need you.

37:47.082 --> 37:48.832
I can't live without you.

38:14.943 --> 38:17.527
I'm sorry.

38:25.653 --> 38:27.754
Now, take me with you.

38:32.260 --> 38:34.260
I'll tell you one thing

38:34.262 --> 38:36.262
You're certainly
not boring, Angie.

38:36.264 --> 38:39.599
But unfortunately,
you're also not that bright.

38:39.601 --> 38:41.685
What are you talking about?

38:41.687 --> 38:44.888
Do you know what the first
rule is in my business?

38:46.308 --> 38:48.308
Never get caught with the goods.

38:48.310 --> 38:51.311
Why else do you think that
I went to all of that trouble

38:51.313 --> 38:53.063
of hiring you to steal
the drive for me?

38:53.065 --> 38:55.699
Why do you think we came up
with that plan of hiding it

38:55.701 --> 38:57.951
in the museum shipments?

38:57.953 --> 38:59.953
So it couldn't get
traced back to me.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.073
My God!

39:04.993 --> 39:08.378
I am so happy
you just said that.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.796
You OK?

39:11.133 --> 39:15.085
Yeah.

39:15.087 --> 39:17.837
- You owe me a new shirt.
- How did you...?

39:17.839 --> 39:20.974
- Blanks and blood bags.
- And this.

39:20.976 --> 39:23.059
Why else do you think that
I went to all of that trouble

39:23.061 --> 39:25.061
of hiring you to steal
the drive for me?

39:25.063 --> 39:27.046
Why do you think we came up
with that plan

39:27.048 --> 39:28.982
of hiding it
in the museum shipments?

39:38.076 --> 39:39.909
Hands out! Up in the air!

39:42.114 --> 39:44.531
Get her!

39:48.036 --> 39:50.703
- Hold it.
- OK, put your hands up!

39:52.207 --> 39:54.207
That was colossally stupid.

39:56.211 --> 39:57.627
You're welcome.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.105
Was Florence, sweetie?

40:21.620 --> 40:25.505
I had a late night last night,
honey. I decided to sleep in.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.461
Well, we'll see. Things are
definitely looking up.

40:40.806 --> 40:44.423
Well, if it isn't the fancy P.I.

40:44.425 --> 40:46.443
Did you come to gloat or what?

40:48.029 --> 40:50.029
I talked to a friend of mine.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.981
He took a quick look
at your case,

40:51.983 --> 40:54.067
and you were right,
the cops bungled it.

40:54.069 --> 40:56.786
And I should care because why?

40:56.788 --> 40:58.822
Because he wants to talk to you.

41:01.042 --> 41:03.409
Well, he can talk
to my left ass-cheek.

41:03.411 --> 41:06.880
Just hear him out, Loretta. You
could be out of here by New Year's.

41:06.882 --> 41:10.467
All lawyers ever want is
to squeeze out every last dime.

41:10.469 --> 41:13.219
- And besides...
- Nobody cares.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.927
You see, that's where
you're wrong.

41:35.410 --> 41:39.245
You're so grown up.

41:39.247 --> 41:41.281
Thank you.

41:41.283 --> 41:43.283
See you soon.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.712
I've ever seen you
look so happy.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.997
I just reunited
a mother and her daughter,

41:57.999 --> 41:59.999
thank you very much.

42:00.001 --> 42:02.051
- And my lawyer called.
- And?

42:02.053 --> 42:05.021
Well, I had to plead guilty
to criminal mischief,

42:05.023 --> 42:07.774
but it's only a $90 fine,
and we have 30 days to pay.

42:07.776 --> 42:10.476
There goes the coffee budget.

42:10.478 --> 42:12.478
They also returned
the million-dollar bond.

42:14.065 --> 42:16.282
You shouldn't have done that,
you could have lost your house.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.867
Yeah, I could have lost
my partner.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.870
You might wish you had
once you see my legal bill.

42:20.872 --> 42:24.023
- Hahaha!
- Seriously, I owe you

42:24.025 --> 42:26.242
- big time.
- Well, in that case...

42:28.330 --> 42:31.130
why don't you put this on.
I got a surprise for you.

42:31.132 --> 42:34.884
You know I'm not really
into hostage role-play, right?

42:34.886 --> 42:36.920
You did say you owe me.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.908
Alright, take
a little step forward.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.910
OK, come on. Right over here.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.947
Yeah, that's good.

43:06.334 --> 43:09.252
- My God, Shade!
- It's perfect.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.204
It is, isn't it?

43:11.206 --> 43:14.240
You can barely tell
that the "Shade" is 10% larger.

43:14.242 --> 43:16.960
- What?!
- I'm kidding.

43:20.882 --> 43:24.100
- To Everett and Shade!
- Everett and Shade.

43:30.859 --> 43:34.027
Watch an all new Private Eyes,
Next Wednesday, on Global.

43:34.896 --> 43:36.396
Three!

43:36.398 --> 43:38.364
Cordell Squires!

43:39.384 --> 43:40.533
Need your help with something.

43:40.535 --> 43:43.286
Find out who took this picture
so I can shut them down.

43:43.288 --> 43:46.205
When a superstar friend
calls in a favour,

43:46.207 --> 43:49.008
Shade and Angie put
on the full court press.

43:49.010 --> 43:52.362
To find out who's
playing a foul game.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.317
Shhh.

43:58.286 --> 43:59.452
Let's never speak of this
moment.

43:59.454 --> 44:00.454
Agreed.
