WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.400
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT,
I'LL FINISH UP.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.600
JIM'S GOT THE LATE SHIFT,
SO NO ONE'S WAITING AT HOME.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.000
OH, I DON'T MIND.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.900
NO ONE'S WAITING FOR ME AT HOME, NEITHER.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.700
IS NED OUT WITH HIS
BASKETBALL FRIENDS?

00:10.700 --> 00:11.800
NOT EXACTLY.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.100
OK, WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:15.100 --> 00:16.100
NOTHING.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.300
OR AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
I KEEP TELLING MYSELF.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.200
NED'S ON A DATE.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.200
LIKE A DATE-DATE,
WITH A GIRL?!

00:26.500 --> 00:27.700
IS IT HIS FIRST ONE?

00:27.800 --> 00:30.200
BECAUSE...YOU DON'T SEEM
VERY PLEASED.

00:30.300 --> 00:34.100
I AM TRYING SO HARD
NOT TO BE OVERPROTECTIVE.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.800
WELL, WHAT IS THERE
TO PROTECT HIM FROM?

00:35.900 --> 00:37.000
HE'S ON A DATE.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.300
WHAT'S THERE TO PROTECT HIM FROM?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:40.300 --> 00:42.400
HE COULD GET HIS HEART BROKEN,
HE COULD CATCH A DISEASE.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.400
AND WHAT DO I KNOW
ABOUT THIS GIRL? RIGHT?

00:44.400 --> 00:46.800
SHE COULD BE INTO DRUGS,
SHE COULD BE INTO SELF MUTILATION,

00:46.800 --> 00:49.200
SHE COULD BE INTO ANIMAL SACRIFICE.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.700
ANIMAL SACRIFICE?

00:50.800 --> 00:52.800
-YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
-NOT REALLY, NO.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.900
WHAT WOULDN'T
A TEENAGE BOY DO

00:54.900 --> 00:56.500
IF YOU PROMISED
TO TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF?

00:56.700 --> 00:58.800
WHAT WOULDN'T JIM
DO NOW? HMM?

00:59.200 --> 01:00.700
-YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY.
-YES.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.800
LOOK, I LOVE YOU,
BUT YOU ARE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.000
OK? NED IS A SMART KID.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.300
BESIDES, IT'S HIS
FIRST DATE, RIGHT?

01:08.400 --> 01:11.300
SO THEY PROBABLY
HAVEN'T EVEN HELD HANDS YET.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.400
WAS THAT OK? I MEAN...

01:17.400 --> 01:19.400
I HOPE THAT IT'S OK
THAT I KISSED YOU.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.800
SO...IT WAS OK THEN.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.600
UM, MAYBE WE CAN
GET TOGETHER AGAIN SOMETIME?

01:33.700 --> 01:35.700
YEAH. I'D LIKE THAT.

01:35.700 --> 01:38.100
GREAT. AWESOME.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.300
I GOTTA GET IN,
IT'S LATE.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.100
HEY, LISA, YOU FORGOT
YOUR SWEATSHIRT--

01:54.200 --> 01:55.200
LISA?

02:01.100 --> 02:03.000
I'M JUST DROPPING
YOUR SWEATER INSIDE.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I'LL SEE YOU
AT SCHOOL, OK?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.300
OHH!

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.200 --> 02:24.700
OH, HEY.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.400
YOUR MOM JUST LEFT.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.900
I KNOW.
I WATCHED HER GO.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.900
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR NOSE?

02:31.100 --> 02:32.300
I WALKED INTO A DOOR.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.400
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.000
NOW WHAT HAPPENED, REALLY?

02:38.600 --> 02:40.600
IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING,
YOU PROMISE NOT TO TELL HER?

02:40.700 --> 02:42.000
NO, I DO NOT KEEP SECRETS
FROM YOUR MOM,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.200
AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

02:43.300 --> 02:44.700
IT MIGHT BE
ABOUT A GHOST.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.000
OH. WELL, MAYBE YOUR MOM DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT THAT.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.500
WHAT HAPPENED?

02:51.800 --> 02:53.200
EVER SINCE I STARTED
BEING WITH LISA,

02:53.300 --> 02:55.300
IT'S FELT LIKE
WE WEREN'T ALONE.

02:57.200 --> 02:57.900
MAYBE I'M JUST A LOSER

02:57.900 --> 02:59.900
WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW
TO ACT AROUND GIRLS,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.200
BUT WITH ALL THE WEIRD STUFF
THAT HAPPENS WHENEVER
I'M WITH HER;

03:03.300 --> 03:06.000
ALL THE ACCIDENTS
AND WHATEVER,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.400
IT'S LIKE THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.100
AND THEN WHEN SHE TOLD ME
THAT HER DAD HAD DIED
A WHILE AGO.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.300
NOW, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.700
THAT YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE
TAUGHT ME ABOUT GHOSTS,

03:15.800 --> 03:17.800
BECAUSE NOW I SEE THEM
EVERYWHERE.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.200
UH, NO, THAT'S--THAT'S
NOT WHAT I WAS THINKING.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.600
WHAT, DID YOU SEE SOMETHING?

03:28.700 --> 03:30.000
I SEE THINGS
ALL THE TIME.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.800
DOESN'T HAVE
TO MEAN ANYTHING.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.500
HOW DID LISA'S
FATHER DIE?

03:34.700 --> 03:35.900
SOME KIND OF ACCIDENT.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.400
SHE DOESN'T
TALK ABOUT IT MUCH.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.500
WELL, I'LL MAKE YOU
A DEAL.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.200
UM, IF YOU CAN STAY AWAY
FROM LISA FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

03:41.200 --> 03:43.200
I'LL LOOK INTO IT
FOR YOU.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.800
COME ON,
WHY CAN'T I SEE HER?

03:44.800 --> 03:46.300
OR I CAN TALK
TO YOUR MOTHER.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.500
OK, FINE.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.800
HEY, NED?

03:56.600 --> 03:57.700
BE CAREFUL.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.000
Can you see us?

04:42.400 --> 04:46.200
ABOUT A GHOST
THAT'S HAUNTING HER SON?

04:46.200 --> 04:49.400
YEAH, AND I FEEL EVEN WORSE
THAT NED'S OUT THERE
UNPROTECTED,

04:49.400 --> 04:51.000
BUT WHAT CAN I DO?

04:51.100 --> 04:52.600
I MEAN, I CAN'T FOLLOW HIM
AROUND ALL DAY,

04:52.600 --> 04:54.100
AND IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD
TO SCARE DELIA

04:54.200 --> 04:55.500
WHEN I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.600
BEST WAY I CAN PROTECT NED
IS TO FIGURE OUT
WHO THIS GHOST IS

04:57.700 --> 04:59.400
AND CROSS HIM OVER.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.400
AND YOU THINK THE GHOST
IS NED'S GIRLFRIEND'S FATHER?

05:01.500 --> 05:02.500
MAYBE.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.700
CHECK THIS OUT.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.000
ACCORDING TO THIS,
2 YEARS AGO

05:05.100 --> 05:07.500
NATHAN BENTON DIED
IN HIS AUTO REPAIR SHOP

05:07.600 --> 05:09.200
WHEN A CAR
FELL ON TOP OF HIM.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.600
WHEN YOU SAW
THE GHOST,

05:10.700 --> 05:11.800
WAS HE WEARING
A MECHANIC'S UNIFORM?

05:11.900 --> 05:13.200
NO, BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.200
HE COULD HAVE DIED LATER
IN THE HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.700
WHAT ELSE DO YOU
REMEMBER ABOUT HIM?

05:16.800 --> 05:18.200
HE HAD A LOT OF BRUISES
ON HIS FACE.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.500
KINDA LIKE
YOU'D HAVE IF A CAR FELL ON YOU?

05:20.900 --> 05:23.200
WELL, I MEAN
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE NASTY MOOD.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.800
WHY WEREN'T YOU
IN CAMPBELL'S CLASS?

05:27.800 --> 05:30.000
OH, I WAS
IN THE LIBRARY STUDYING FOR BIO.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.600
I'VE GOT A TEST TOMORROW.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.000
THAT'S GOOD,
BECAUSE

05:33.100 --> 05:34.500
I WAS BEGINNING
TO GET THE FEELING

05:34.600 --> 05:35.800
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE ME.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.100
NOT AT ALL.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.600
I DON'T WANT
TO SCARE YOU AWAY,

05:41.600 --> 05:44.700
BUT...MY LIFE'S
BEEN KIND OF WEIRD LATELY.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.900
AND IT JUST MEANS
A LOT TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU;

05:47.900 --> 05:50.600
SOMEONE WHO LISTENS,
AND YOU MAKE ME FEEL

05:50.600 --> 05:53.700
LIKE I HAVE
SOME PLACE SAFE.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.300
OH, MY GOD!

06:18.300 --> 06:21.100
OH, MY GOD, NED,
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN!SHE'S GONNA KILL ME!

06:21.200 --> 06:22.800
WHO, YOUR MOM?
I CAN'T GET IN TROUBLE!

06:22.800 --> 06:24.900
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME!

06:25.000 --> 06:26.400
DON'T WORRY. I'LL JUST SAY
THAT IT WAS MY FAULT.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.600
I CAN'T LET YOU
DO THAT.

06:27.700 --> 06:30.800
MAYBE IT WON'T MATTER.
MAYBE NOBODY SAW.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.000
OUT OF THE CAR.
BOTH OF YOU. NOW.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.800
YOU TWO ARE SO LUCKY
NOBODY GOT HURT.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.400
LISA, WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

06:42.500 --> 06:45.300
I JUST CALLED HER.
SHE SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.300
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHE'S GOING TO DO WITH YOU,

06:47.300 --> 06:51.000
BUT I CAN TELL YOU NED
IS GOING TO PAY FOR HIS SHARE OF THE DAMAGES.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.500
SINCE BOTH OF YOU
WERE IN THE BACKSEAT,

06:52.600 --> 06:54.200
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL
WHO'S AT FAULT.

06:54.200 --> 06:54.900
MOM!

06:55.000 --> 06:57.600
WHAT, NED? IS THERE
SOMETHING I'M MISSING HERE?

06:57.700 --> 06:59.200
LISA! GET IN THE CAR.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.800
YOU'RE IN
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.500
UM, EXCUSE ME.
I'M NED'S MOTHER.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.100
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M SORRY.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.100
MY NAME'S AMY.
I'M LISA'S SISTER.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.500
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

07:10.600 --> 07:12.300
SHE'S AT WORK,
AND SHE FEELS
INCREDIBLY BAD,

07:12.400 --> 07:14.300
BUT SHE JUST
COULDN'T GET AWAY.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.500
SHE SAID TO TELL YOU
SHE'LL CALL YOU AS
SOON AS SHE CAN.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.300
OK, WELL, I HOPE IT'S SOON.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.500
DEFINITELY. BYE.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.400
OK.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
START AT THE BEGINNING,
AND DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING OUT.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.200
HEY, IS EVERYTHING
OK WITH NED?

07:34.600 --> 07:38.700
DID YOU TELL HIM
THAT THE GHOST OF HIS
GIRLFRIEND'S FATHER WAS HAUNTING HIM?

07:40.100 --> 07:41.700
I SAW A GHOST
AROUND NED,

07:41.800 --> 07:44.000
AND I TOLD HIM
THAT I WOULD FIND OUT IF IT WAS HAUNTING HIM.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.400
I DIDN'T ASK
IF YOU SAW A GHOST.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.300
I ASKED IF--

07:47.900 --> 07:50.800
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
YOU KEEPING SECRETS
WITH MY SON,

07:50.900 --> 07:52.300
WHICH FRANKLY,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

07:52.300 --> 07:54.200
HOW YOU CAN DO
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
WITH HIS FATHER.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.300
OK, I KNEW THAT
YOU WERE GOING TO GET
UPSET ABOUT THIS TOPIC,

07:56.400 --> 07:58.400
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE
KEPT IT FROM YOU.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.800
I'M SORRY.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.200
OK.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.300
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP,

08:05.400 --> 08:06.500
BUT NEXT TIME--

08:06.600 --> 08:08.400
I WILL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.200
OK.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.900
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU KNOW?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.700
LISA'S FATHER
DIED IN AN ACCIDENT
IN HIS AUTO REPAIR SHOP.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.200
SO HE KNEW ABOUT CARS,
WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN
THE PARKING LOT BUSINESS,

08:23.300 --> 08:25.700
AND IT SEEMED LIKE
HE HAD A LOGICAL MOTIVE--

08:25.700 --> 08:26.900
PROTECTING HIS CHILD.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.600
FROM NED?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.100
I REMEMBER THAT YOU HAD
THE SAME FEARS ABOUT LISA.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.100
YES, AND I WAS RIGHT.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.900
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO HER MOTHER YET?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.700
SHE CALLED.
SHE APOLOGIZED
UP AND DOWN.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.500
SHE SAID IT WAS
ALL HER DAUGHTER'S
FAULT,

08:39.600 --> 08:41.799
THAT SHE WASN'T
GOING TO CHARGE NED
A THING.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.300
SO WE'RE GONNA
GET TOGETHER LATER
AND TALK ABOUT IT.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.400
GOOD.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.900
LOOK, MELINDA,
MAYBE...

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
YOU SHOULD GO OVER
THERE AND SNOOP
AROUND, YOU KNOW?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.200
IF THERE REALLY IS
A GHOST...

08:56.800 --> 08:58.400
THAT WAS MY NEXT MOVE.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.000
WHO IS IT?

09:04.100 --> 09:07.900
HI, UH, I'M MELINDA GORDON,
A FRIEND OF NED BANKS.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.300
OH, HI. NED'S TALKED
ABOUT YOU BEFORE.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.900
YOU WORK WITH HIS MOM.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.800
ARE YOU LISA?

09:13.900 --> 09:16.700
DID YOU WANT
TO TALK TO MY MOM?

09:16.800 --> 09:19.000
I DO, BUT I'D ACTUALLY
LIKE TO TALK TO YOU FIRST
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.400
CAN I COME IN?

09:21.700 --> 09:23.600
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S SUCH
A NICE AFTERNOON.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.000
WHY DON'T WE JUST
SIT OUT HERE?

09:25.100 --> 09:27.100
OK.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.200
LOOK, I CAME HERE
BECAUSE...

09:32.300 --> 09:36.600
I KNOW THAT NED LIKES YOU,
AND I WANT TO HELP.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.400
SO DO YOU MIND
IF I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS?

09:38.500 --> 09:40.100
ABOUT WHAT?

09:40.200 --> 09:42.300
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL
UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION,

09:42.400 --> 09:44.700
BUT I WANTED TO KNOW
MORE ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
HI, I'M AMY.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.300
I'M LISA'S SISTER.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.000
DID I OVERHEAR
THAT YOU'RE A FRIEND
OF NED'S?

09:51.100 --> 09:53.300
YES, HI. MELINDA,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.700
DID LISA OFFER YOU
ANYTHING TO DRINK?

09:55.700 --> 09:56.900
SOME TEA, MAYBE?

09:56.900 --> 09:59.100
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
I EVEN GAVE HER THE CHANCE,

09:59.100 --> 10:00.700
BUT THAT WOULD BE GREAT,
THANK YOU.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.500
I'LL TELL MOM YOU'RE HERE.
OK.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.000
HEY, HENRY.
GO SAY HELLO, HENRY.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.500
HI, I'M HENRY.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.900
OH, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:12.900 --> 10:15.700
I'VE NEVER MET
SUCH A POLITE FAMILY.

10:17.300 --> 10:21.200
LISA, SWEETHEART,
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

10:21.200 --> 10:21.500
THAT'S MOM.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.800
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.200
OK.
Henry: OK.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.600
SO, HOW LONG HAVE YOU GUYS
LIVED IN GRANDVIEW?

10:32.700 --> 10:36.900
OH, WHAT WAS IT...
3 YEARS? I LOSE COUNT.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.500
3 1/2. I WAS 9.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.400
MOM SAYS
SHE'S GETTING A MIGRAINE.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.700
SHE'S SEEING
HER SHAPES AND SPOTS.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.900
YEAH, I THINK I KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.600
COME ON, HENRY.
WE'RE GOING
TO GO HELP HER OUT.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.700
BYE.
BYE.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.400
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD
JUST COME BACK
LATER, MAYBE,

10:56.400 --> 10:58.400
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU NEED TO GO AND TAKE CARE
OF YOUR MOM.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.100
YEAH. COME BACK TOMORROW
WHEN SHE'S FEELING BETTER.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.100
OK.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.600
I WILL.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.300
REALLY NICE GARDEN.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.800
I'VE NEVER SEEN
SUCH BEAUTIFUL SNAPDRAGONS.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.200
OH, THEY'RE HYBRIDS.
THANKS.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.400
ARE YOU A FRIEND
OF THE BENTONS?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.900
A NEW FRIEND, YES.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
THEY HAVEN'T HAD
THE BEST OF LUCK,HAVE THEY?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.400
HMM, NOT REALLY.

11:39.500 --> 11:43.200
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW
NATHAN...VERY WELL.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.200
WHAT WAS HE LIKE?

11:45.300 --> 11:46.700
HE WASN'T
A VERY NICE PERSON.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.100
NOT JUST TO ME.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.200
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:49.300 --> 11:50.700
HE WAS ALWAYS
YELLING AT ME

11:50.800 --> 11:52.100
TO TRIM MY TREES,

11:52.200 --> 11:54.600
EVEN IF THEY
HUNG OVER ONE INCH
INTO HIS YARD.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.000
SAID HE WAS AFRAID
THAT THE BRANCHES

11:56.100 --> 11:58.300
WERE GOING
TO FALL ON THE KIDS,
BUT HONESTLY!

11:58.300 --> 12:00.100
SO HE WAS A LITTLE
OVERPROTECTIVE.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.900
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN THE WAY HE TREATED
THOSE KIDS.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.700
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.200
HE DIDN'T LET THEM
OUT OF THAT HOUSE

12:06.300 --> 12:08.300
FOR THE WHOLE
FIRST MONTH
THAT THEY LIVED THERE,

12:08.400 --> 12:09.700
NOT EVEN FOR A MINUTE.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.300
I MEAN...

12:11.400 --> 12:14.400
I'M NOT SAYING THINGS
ARE ANY EASIER
FOR KAREN NOW.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.100
SHE HAS TO WORK 2 SHIFTS
AT THAT PHONE REP JOB
JUST TO SUPPORT THE KIDS.

12:18.200 --> 12:22.000
BUT...I THINK THINGS
ARE STARTING TO LOOK UP.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.500
HOW SO?

12:23.500 --> 12:25.500
WELL, I SEE HER
GETTING DRESSED UP

12:25.600 --> 12:28.200
AND GOING OUT
EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.400
I THINK SHE'S FINALLY
MET SOMEONE.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.400
AND SHE'S GARDENING
AGAIN,

12:33.500 --> 12:36.600
AND SHE SAYS
THE SWEETEST THINGS
ABOUT MY FLOWERS,

12:36.700 --> 12:38.100
AND MY TREES.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.200
GOOD TO HEAR.

12:40.300 --> 12:43.000
UM...THANKS.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.900
STAY AWAY!

12:56.000 --> 12:58.800
MY FAMILY BELONGS TO ME!

13:09.100 --> 13:10.300
THE GHOST
IS BEHAVING IN DEATH

13:10.400 --> 13:11.600
THE SAME WAY
HE DID IN LIFE--

13:11.600 --> 13:13.300
OVERPROTECTIVE,
SMOTHERING,
CONTROLLING.

13:13.400 --> 13:17.100
YEAH, BUT THE WEIRD PART IS,
IT'S LIKE THEY ALL KNEW
HE WAS THERE.

13:17.100 --> 13:17.600
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

13:17.700 --> 13:20.000
WELL, IF HE'S DEAD, YOU KNOW,
WHY BE ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.800
THESE KIDS WERE BEING
SO POLITE.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.600
AND THE MOM,
WHEN SHE GOT HER MIGRAINE,

13:24.700 --> 13:26.500
SAID THAT SHE WAS SEEING
SHAPES AND SPOTS.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.800
I MEAN, MAYBE
SHE'S ACTUALLY JUST
SEEING A MANIFESTATION OF HIM.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.700
IS THAT POSSIBLE?
I DON'T KNOW.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.000
BUT IF HE MOVES
ENOUGH STUFF AROUND,

13:33.000 --> 13:34.600
THEY DON'T HAVE TO SEE HIM
TO KNOW HE'S THERE.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.600
YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW
YOU'RE DESCRIBING

13:37.600 --> 13:39.000
THE BEHAVIOR
OF AN ABUSER.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.800
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.400
WELL, THEY
ISOLATE PEOPLE

13:42.400 --> 13:45.700
FROM ANY RELATIONSHIP
THAT WILL TAKE THEIR
VICTIMS AWAY FROM THEM.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.200
WELL, I KNOW
HE DOESN'T WANT LISA
TO BE WITH NED,

13:49.200 --> 13:52.700
AND I'M GUESS HE'S NOT
A BIG FAN OF HIS WIFE'S
NEW BOYFRIEND.

13:53.000 --> 13:53.900
AND YOU.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.200
I'LL BE CAREFUL, OK?

13:56.200 --> 13:57.400
I PROMISE.
OK.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.400
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

13:58.600 --> 13:59.300
YOU, TOO.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.400
HI, DELIA.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.600
I KNOW
YOU'RE DOWN HERE.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.400
NATHAN?

14:26.400 --> 14:28.600
PLEASE TALK TO ME.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.600
I JUST WANT TO HELP YOU.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.500
I WANT TO HELP
YOUR FAMILY.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.900
OH!

14:37.100 --> 14:40.000
WHY?

14:40.100 --> 14:42.700
MELINDA, ARE YOU OK?!

14:42.800 --> 14:43.900
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?!

14:44.000 --> 14:46.700
I DON'T...KNOW.
A VISION, I THINK?

14:46.800 --> 14:50.200
I WAS RELIVING
SOMEONE ELSE'S
EXPERIENCE.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.100
OF WHAT?

14:52.200 --> 14:55.600
OF BEING HIT,
KNOCKED TO THE GROUND.

14:55.700 --> 14:57.700
IS THIS ABOUT NED'S GHOST?

14:57.700 --> 14:59.900
IS NED IN ANY KIND OF DANGER?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.400
THIS IS SO WRONG.
IT'S SO TOTALLY UNFAIR.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.100
NO, IT'S NOT, NED.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.500
IF YOUR CHILD WAS IN DANGER,
YOU'D DO THE VERY SAME THING.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.700
IN DANGER FROM WHAT?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.500
FROM THE WHOLE BAD SITUATION!

15:12.500 --> 15:13.600
WHAT SITUATION?

15:13.600 --> 15:16.300
THE HOUSE, THAT FAMILY,
EVERYTHING.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.700
YOU MEAN THE GHOST.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.200
OK, THE GHOST.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.500
YOU'RE SUCH
A HYPOCRITE!

15:21.600 --> 15:23.600
FIRST YOU YELL
AT MELINDA FOR TALKING
TO ME ABOUT GHOSTS,

15:23.600 --> 15:25.300
AND NOW YOU SAY
I CAN'T SEE LISA
BECAUSE OF ONE.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.000
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO THINK?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.400
THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE HER,
YOU GET YOUR NOSE BLOODY.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.800
IT WASN'T
THE FIRST TIME.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.400
THE FIRST 5 TIMES
YOU HAD NO PROBLEM,

15:32.400 --> 15:33.600
UNTIL I SAID
THE WORD "DATE,"

15:33.600 --> 15:34.800
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU STARTED
FREAKING OUT.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.600
YES, AND THEN THE NEXT TIME
YOU SAW HER, YOU GET
INTO A CAR ACCIDENT.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.000
I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO MEET WITH HER MOTHER
EVER SINCE,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
AND SHE KEEPS
RESCHEDULING ON ME!

15:42.000 --> 15:44.200
SHE'S A WIDOW TRYING
TO RAISE HER KIDS ALONE,

15:44.400 --> 15:45.600
JUST LIKE YOU.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.700
SHE IS NOT LIKE ME, NED.
I KEEP MY APPOINTMENTS.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.200
WHAT ARE YOU REALLY
AFRAID OF, MOM?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.300
TELL ME. BECAUSE
I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S NOT GHOSTS.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.000
I AM NOT AFRAID
OF ANYTHING.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.700
GOOD. THEN
I CAN SEE LISA.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.300
NO. NO, NED, YOU CAN'T.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.200
TRY AND STOP ME.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.300
NED...

16:05.600 --> 16:07.300
NED, COME BACK HERE!

16:10.400 --> 16:12.400
SHE'S SO OVERPROTECTIVE,
IT'S NUTS.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.100
SHE WON'T LET ME
OUT OF HER SIGHT.

16:14.100 --> 16:14.600
I FEEL YA.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.000
YOUR MOM EVER
GET LIKE THAT?

16:16.900 --> 16:18.800
MY MOM, MY DAD.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.100
I HOPE IT'S OK
MELINDA CAME OVER.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.200
SHE WANTED TO ASK
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.300
NED, DO YOU EVER THINK
THAT MAYBE YOUR MOM
MIGHT BE RIGHT?

16:26.900 --> 16:28.100
ABOUT BEING WITH ME?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.600
NO WAY. WHY?

16:30.600 --> 16:34.800
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU BEFORE
THAT MY FAMILY...

16:34.800 --> 16:36.600
MY LIFE'S BEEN
A LITTLE BIT WEIRD LATELY?

16:36.600 --> 16:37.500
YEAH.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.000
NEVER MIND.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.200
LOOK, I CAN'T EXPLAIN.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.100
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TRY
AND BE FRIENDS.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
LISA, WAIT.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.100
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU DON'T THINK

16:51.700 --> 16:53.400
MAYBE I'D
UNDERSTAND.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.800
MAYBE I ALREADY DO.

16:55.900 --> 16:57.500
I'M SORRY, I GOTTA GO.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.300
NATHAN?

17:37.700 --> 17:40.500
I KNOW YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE DOING WHAT'S BEST
FOR YOUR FAMILY

17:40.600 --> 17:41.900
AND YOUR CHILDREN.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.600
MAYBE YOU THINK
YOU'RE BEING
A GOOD PARENT.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.800
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.500
YOU'RE HURTING THEM, STILL.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.100
UH, EXCUSE ME?

17:51.500 --> 17:52.900
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

17:53.800 --> 17:54.800
AMY.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.400
LOOK, UM...

17:58.200 --> 17:59.900
I KNOW THAT YOU
LOST YOUR DAD,

18:00.200 --> 18:02.700
AND THAT'S
HARD FOR YOU
AND YOUR MOM.

18:03.200 --> 18:07.100
BUT I THINK YOU'VE
SEEN SOME THINGS
AND FELT SOME THINGS

18:07.100 --> 18:08.600
THAT MAYBE
YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN,

18:08.600 --> 18:10.000
AND THAT'S REALLY
SCARY.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.200
NO, NO, WHAT'S
SCARY IS YOU,

18:12.200 --> 18:13.400
SNEAKING INTO
OUR YARD

18:13.500 --> 18:14.700
WHEN OUR MOM
ISN'T HERE

18:14.700 --> 18:16.800
AND ASKING US
ALL SORTS OF
WEIRD QUESTIONS.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.600
I REALLY NEED YOU
TO HEAR THIS.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
YOUR FATHER
IS STILL HERE,
I'VE SEEN HIM.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.300
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:24.300 --> 18:26.500
I KNOW IT SOUNDS
STRANGE,

18:28.500 --> 18:29.900
BUT I CAN SEE
GHOSTS.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.000
YOU'VE SEEN DAD?
WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
SHE'S LYING.
DON'T ASK HER THAT.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.700
I CAN ONLY SEE THEM
THE WAY THAT THEY DI,

18:37.700 --> 18:41.100
WHICH MEANS
THAT HE MAY NOT LOOK
HOW YOU REMEMBER HIM.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.200
HE'S WEARING
A SWEATSHIRT,

18:42.300 --> 18:43.500
AND THERE'S BRUISES
ON HIS FACE--

18:43.600 --> 18:47.000
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT...
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

18:47.700 --> 18:48.600
COME ON,
LET'S GO INSIDE.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.700
AMY, PLEASE JUST
TELL YOUR MOM.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.200
IF YOU DON'T,
I WILL. BUT YOUR--

18:51.300 --> 18:53.900
YOUR FATHER NEEDS HELP
CROSSING INTO THE LIGHT.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.900
I SAID...LEAVE.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.600
HEY, I GOT YOUR CALL.

19:12.700 --> 19:13.700
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:14.100 --> 19:15.300
WE DIDN'T WANT
TO ADMIT IT,

19:15.300 --> 19:17.900
BUT YOU AND MELINDA,
YOU SORTA GUESSED RIGHT.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.900
THINGS AREN'T RIGHT
AT OUR HOUSE.

19:21.900 --> 19:23.400
ADMIT WHAT? LISA?

19:27.000 --> 19:27.800
MOM'S GONE.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.200
SHE'S MISSING.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.200
WE WERE AFRAID
TO TELL ANYONE,

19:33.200 --> 19:36.300
'CAUSE PEOPLE
MIGHT SAY SHE'S NOT
A FIT MOM.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.200
WHAT PEOPLE?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.400
SOCIAL SERVICES.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.000
PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.400
SEE, SHE STARTED
SEEING THIS GUY.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.600
HIS NAME'S STEVE,
BUT HE LIVES
OUT OF TOWN,

19:46.600 --> 19:47.900
LIKE AN HOUR'S DRIVE.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.300
SHE WANTED
TO BE WITH HIM.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.300
WE SAID THAT
IT WOULD BE OK ON
OUR OWN FOR A NIGHT,

19:54.500 --> 19:56.400
BUT WE HAVEN'T
SEEN HER SINCE.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.000
HOW LONG'S SHE BEEN GONE?

19:59.200 --> 20:01.300
2 DAYS.

20:01.300 --> 20:04.700
WE KEEP CALLING
HER CELL, AND NOTHING.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.400
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, NED.

20:12.100 --> 20:14.400
FIRST THING?

20:14.400 --> 20:15.800
WE TELL THE POLICE.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.600
Amy: WHEN SHE LEFT,
SHE WAS ON HER OWN.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.600
Lisa: BUT SHE LEFT
HER STUFF...WHY?

20:36.700 --> 20:38.700
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE KIDS.
TAKE THEM WITH YOU.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.600
REALLY? THEY HAD
TO BRING THE KIDS HERE?

20:40.700 --> 20:42.900
THEY JUST NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO IDENTIFY THE MOTHER'S
BELONGINGS.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.700
HER BELONGINGS?
WHAT DID THEY FIND?

20:44.700 --> 20:47.200
NOTHING. HER PURSE
IS ON THE FRONT SEAT,
KEYS ARE IN THE IGNITION,

20:47.300 --> 20:49.100
DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR
IS WIDE OPEN,

20:49.200 --> 20:51.700
THERE'S NOT A SCRATCH
ON THIS CAR, AND THE ENGINE
STARTED RIGHT UP.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.700
THE KIDS SAY
SHE WAS ON HER WAY
TO MEET HER BOYFRIEND.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.300
SO DO THEY THINK
SHE WAS CARJACKED,

20:56.400 --> 20:58.500
THE POLICE,
OR KIDNAPPED?

20:58.500 --> 21:01.600
PROBABLY, BUT, UH...
MORE IMPORTANT, DO YOU?

21:05.200 --> 21:07.000
NO. THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.500
BAD NEWS IS...

21:26.400 --> 21:27.800
THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR COMING.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.600
Man: ABSOLUTELY.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.800
HEY, HENRY.
ARE YOU OK?

21:37.900 --> 21:39.800
YEAH.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.200
WHAT BOOK ARE YOU READING?

21:43.200 --> 21:46.600
IT'S NOTHING.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.900
CAN I SEE IT?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.900
<i>MEMORY BOOK FOR DAD.</i>

21:52.000 --> 21:53.400
DID YOU MAKE THIS?

21:53.500 --> 21:55.000
WE ALL DID.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.700
WOW.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.100
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.200
YOU REALLY LOVED YOUR DAD,
DIDN'T YOU?

22:06.200 --> 22:08.400
MUST BE HARD...

22:08.500 --> 22:10.800
TO HEAR THINGS
THAT ARE CRITICAL.

22:10.900 --> 22:13.400
<i>IT'S HARD
TO HEAR THINGS
THAT ARE WRONG.</i>

22:14.400 --> 22:15.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:15.200 --> 22:16.700
MY DAD WASN'T
LIKE THAT.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.800
HE WASN'T MEAN
OR SCARY.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.600
HE WAS AWESOME.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
WELL, I--[SIGHS]

22:24.100 --> 22:25.700
I REALLY WANT
TO BELIEVE THAT,

22:25.700 --> 22:28.600
BUT...WHAT ABOUT
WHEN YOU FIRST MOVED HERE?

22:28.700 --> 22:31.200
I MEAN, SOMEONE TOLD ME
THAT HE WOULDN'T EVEN
LET YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.000
WE HAD MEASLES.
OF COURSE NOT.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.400
YOU HAD MEASLES?

22:34.400 --> 22:35.800
YEAH.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.900
THAT'S WHEN WE MADE
OUR FIRST MEMORY BOOK.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.800
<i>I THINK IT WAS CALLED
THE GREAT OUTDOORS.</i>

22:40.900 --> 22:44.200
DAD QUIT HIS JOB TO COME
HOME AND STAY WITH US
UNTIL WE GOT BETTER.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.500
HE GAVE US ALL THESE
CRAZY PROJECTS TO DO--
THOSE FLOWERS...

22:46.600 --> 22:48.200
Amy: OH, MY GOD, MOM.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.000
OH, MY GOD!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OK!

22:50.000 --> 22:51.700
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!

22:51.700 --> 22:54.800
THE WHOLE TOWN'S
BEEN GOING NUTS WORRYING!
YOU CALLED.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.200
NO, NO THERE ARE NO
MESSAGES, WE DIDN'T GET ANY.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.400
WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?

22:59.400 --> 23:01.000
OK.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.400
OK, WELL, CALL BACK
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

23:04.500 --> 23:07.700
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OK.
I LOVE YOU.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.500
BYE.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.700
THAT WAS MOM!

23:11.800 --> 23:14.400
SHE'S OK!
SHE'S COMING HOME!

23:14.500 --> 23:18.300
Henry: THAT'S GREAT!
SHE'S ALL RIGHT. AWESOME.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.200
BYE. THANKS. BYE.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.400
YOU GUYS...
SHE'S STILL HERE.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.400
UM...

23:39.500 --> 23:40.700
EVERYBODY'S LEFT.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.200
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU NEED?

23:42.200 --> 23:44.600
MORNING GLORIES.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.100
WERE THOSE ONE
OF HER FAVORITES?

23:46.200 --> 23:47.700
YOUR MOM?

23:49.100 --> 23:50.900
YOU KNOW,
I NOTICED THEM BEFORE.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.100
IT JUST...DIDN'T HIT ME.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.900
THESE ONLY BLOOM
EARLY IN THE MORNING,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.900
AND THE SUN'S PRETTY
HIGH IN THE SKY RIGHT
NOW, AND LOOK AT 'EM.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.600
WIDE OPEN, BEAUTIFUL.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.800
HER SPIRIT'S
AFFECTING THEM.

24:05.900 --> 24:08.400
THEY CAN SENSE HER
JUST LIKE YOU HAVE.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.100
WAIT, SO FIRST
YOU'RE SEEING
DAD'S GHOST,

24:10.200 --> 24:12.100
AND NOW YOU'RE--YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE SEEING MOM'S?

24:12.200 --> 24:13.600
WAS IT CANCER?

24:13.700 --> 24:15.800
IS THAT HOW SHE LOST
ALL HER HAIR?

24:15.900 --> 24:18.000
'CAUSE I SAW
A PICTURE OF HER
INSIDE,

24:18.100 --> 24:20.200
AND SHE LOOKS
SO DIFFERENT NOW.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.700
SHE'S STILL SICK?
IS SHE HURTING?

24:22.800 --> 24:24.100
HENRY...
NO, SWEETHEART.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.200
SHE'S NOT
HURTINE.ANYMORE.
ALL THE PAIN'S GONE.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.100
NO, I JUST TALKED TO MOM,
SHE'S FINE.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.500
YEAH, I FOUND THIS,
WHERE YOU LEFT IT.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.300
THERE WAS
AN OUTGOING CALL
MADE TO THIS HOUSE

24:35.300 --> 24:37.900
AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME
YOU SAID YOU WERE ON
THE PHONE WITH YOUR MOM.

24:37.900 --> 24:40.900
OK. WHATEVER YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING FOR US,

24:41.000 --> 24:42.800
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED.
WE'RE GOING INSIDE,
COME ON!

24:42.800 --> 24:44.700
IS THIS HOW
SHE WANTED IT?

24:44.800 --> 24:47.700
SHE WANTED HER DEATH
TO BE A SECRET?

24:47.800 --> 24:49.600
IS THAT WHY
YOU BURIED HER HERE?

24:53.200 --> 24:55.400
YOU GUYS...

24:55.400 --> 24:57.400
HOW COULD YOU BE
SO STUPID?

24:57.500 --> 24:58.400
HOW COULD YOU
BRING HER HERE?!

24:58.500 --> 24:59.800
IS SHE HERE?

24:59.900 --> 25:01.700
HOW LONG HAVE THEY
LIVED ALONE?

25:01.800 --> 25:04.200
THEY'RE NOT ALONE,
THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT!

25:04.200 --> 25:08.200
YOU'VE RUINED EVERYTHING!??????

25:23.500 --> 25:27.400
SO ONE CALL FROM YOU
AND POLICE SEND OVER
THEIR BURLIEST MEN

25:27.500 --> 25:28.800
WITH PICKS
AND SHOVELS.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.300
I SAID YOU
TOLD ME THE TRUTH,

25:31.300 --> 25:33.500
SO FOR YOUR OWN SAKE,
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME A LIAR.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.200
YOU SAID YOUR MOM WAS SICK.

25:36.300 --> 25:39.300
SHE FOUGHT IT SO HARD.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.300
SHE HAD SO MANY
ROUNDS OF CHEMO,

25:42.300 --> 25:45.000
AND THAT'S WHY
SHE LOST HER HAIR.

25:45.100 --> 25:48.000
SHE GOT WEAK AND THIN,

25:48.100 --> 25:49.900
AND ANY LITTLE THING
WOULD BRUISE HER.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.700
MOM! IT'S OK, MOM.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.800
WHY?

25:55.800 --> 25:57.600
IT'S NOT FAIR!

25:58.900 --> 26:01.200
SO THE SPIRIT YOU SAW...

26:01.200 --> 26:03.400
WE KNEW YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MOM,

26:03.400 --> 26:07.200
AND WE KNEW IT WOULD ONLY BE
A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE
YOU REALIZED THAT, TOO.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.200
SO YOU PRETENDED
SHE WAS KIDNAPPED.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.500
YOU WEREN'T THE ONLY ONE
LOOKING FOR HER,

26:11.600 --> 26:13.800
SO WE HAD TO BUY TIME,
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.

26:13.900 --> 26:16.100
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO HIDE HER DEATH?

26:16.200 --> 26:17.500
IT WAS MOM'S IDEA.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.400
SHE WANTED US
TO BE TOGETHER
NO MATTER WHAT.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.600
HOW LONG HAVE YOU GUYS
BEEN ON YOUR OWN?

26:26.300 --> 26:28.800
MOM DIED LAST FALL.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.900
WE WANTED HER TO ALWAYS
BE WITH US.

26:31.900 --> 26:35.300
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO KEEP HER CLOSE.

26:52.700 --> 26:55.200
I'M GONNA BE 18
IN A FEW MONTHS,

26:55.200 --> 26:58.000
AND THEN
I CAN LEGALLY
FILE FOR CUSTODY.

26:58.100 --> 26:59.600
HOW MANY MONTHS?

26:59.700 --> 27:02.300
10.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.300
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.200
THE NEIGHBORS SAID
THAT SHE SAW YOUR MOTHER
LEAVING ON DATES.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.800
WE HAD A SITTER.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.100
SHE'D COME AT NIGHT
AND HELP HENRY
WITH HIS HOMEWORK

27:12.200 --> 27:14.100
AND DO SOME
GROCERY SHOPPING.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.100
AND LET ME GUESS,
SHE JUST HAPPENS
TO LOOK LIKE YOUR MOM.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.500
SO THE VOICE THAT I HEARD
COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE,

27:20.600 --> 27:22.300
THE WOMAN ON THE PHONE
WITH DELIA,

27:22.300 --> 27:24.300
THE ONE THAT'S BEEN
TALKING TO ALL
THE NEIGHBORS,

27:24.400 --> 27:26.600
THAT'S--THAT'S ALL YOU.

27:26.700 --> 27:30.100
MOM TAUGHT ME
HOW TO DO HER JOB.

27:30.200 --> 27:34.300
SHE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO BE HER.

27:34.300 --> 27:39.700
MOM KNEW
SHE WAS DYING.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.900
HER JOB HAS BENEFITS--
HEALTH INSURANCE.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.400
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE STEALING.

27:52.500 --> 27:53.900
I'M DOING THE WORK.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.900
AND THE HOUSE
IS KEPT CLEAN,
WE'RE FED,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.300
LISA AND HENRY
GET STRAIGHT As.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.800
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

28:01.300 --> 28:02.600
HOW MANY DAYS OF SCHOOL
HAVE YOU MISSED?

28:02.700 --> 28:06.100
DO YOU EVEN
HAVE FRIENDS ANYMORE?

28:06.200 --> 28:08.300
I'M FINE.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.900
WE'RE FINE.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.100
AND IT'S HARD,
BUT MOM WAS TOUGH,

28:13.200 --> 28:14.600
SO WE HAVE TO BE
TOUGH, TOO.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.600
YOU'RE NOT FINE.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.600
LOOK AROUND YOU.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.800
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH TROUBLE YOU'RE IN?

28:25.400 --> 28:27.500
Henry: MOM!

28:27.600 --> 28:29.300
MOM!

28:29.400 --> 28:31.100
HENRY!

28:32.600 --> 28:35.300
HENRY, WAIT.
HENRY...OH, NO.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.800
IT'S OK.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.900
I WARNED YOU
TO LEAVE THEM ALONE.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.800
I COULDN'T,
BECAUSE YOU DID.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.600
LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WERE SICK,

28:51.700 --> 28:53.300
AND I'M SORRY
THAT YOU DIED,

28:53.400 --> 28:55.100
BUT YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON,
YOU HAVE TO LET THEM GO.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.500
GO? GO WHERE?

28:57.500 --> 28:59.600
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT?

28:59.700 --> 29:02.000
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.900
THE COUNTY,
YOU MEAN.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.100
DIDN'T YOU HAVE
ANY RELATIVES?
DID YOUR HUSBAND?

29:06.100 --> 29:07.600
THERE'S NO ONE.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.400
WELL, WHAT ABOUT FRIENDS?

29:09.400 --> 29:11.300
I MEAN, YOU WENT
THROUGH THE TROUBLE

29:11.400 --> 29:12.800
OF DOING ALL THIS PLANNING.

29:12.900 --> 29:15.600
DIDN'T YOU MAKE OUT A WILL
OR SPECIFY ANY CUSTODY?

29:15.700 --> 29:17.400
DO YOU THINK
I DIDN'T TRY?

29:17.500 --> 29:21.300
WHO WANTS 3 GRIEVING ORPHANS
IN THEIR HOME?

29:21.400 --> 29:23.500
THE SYSTEM CAN HARDLY PLACE
2 SIBLINGS TOGETHER.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.200
THERE'S A SOCIAL WORKER NOW.

29:29.900 --> 29:32.100
I JUST WANTED THEM
TO STAY A FAMILY.

29:32.200 --> 29:35.000
THAT DOESN'T HAVE
TO CHANGE.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.400
YOU COULDN'T BE MORE WRONG.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.700
Lisa: I JUST WANTED
TO SAY I'M SORRY.

29:48.700 --> 29:51.200
I COULDN'T TELL YOU,
I JUST COULDN'T.

29:51.300 --> 29:54.000
Ned: NO, I FEEL BAD.

29:54.100 --> 29:56.100
IF I HADN'T PUSHED
TO GET CLOSER,

29:56.100 --> 29:58.700
MAYBE YOU GUYS COULD HAVE
JUST GONE ALONE.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.500
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

30:01.500 --> 30:03.200
IF I DIDN'T
LIKE YOU SO MUCH.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.900
I DO, NED.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.700
YOU HEAR ME,
RIGHT?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.800
YEAH.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.400
I HEAR YOU.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.800
I HAVE TO GO.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.400
CAN I SEE YOU TOMORROW?

30:29.800 --> 30:33.000
I'D LOVE THAT.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.300
MMM. YOU KIDS
ARE INCREDIBLE.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.700
YOU DIDN'T LET ME COOK,
AT LEAST LET ME CLEAN UP.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.200
WE HAVE
AN ALTERNATING
CHORE LIST.

30:45.300 --> 30:46.700
WE LIKE
TO STICK TO IT.

30:46.800 --> 30:50.800
LOOK, I--I KNOW
THAT FOSTER CARE
SOUNDS...SCARY,

30:50.800 --> 30:53.000
BUT IT'S NOT.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.400
I DON'T KNOW
VERY MUCH ABOUT IT.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.900
YEAH, THE SOCIAL WORKER
SEEMED NICE.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.100
OH!

31:02.100 --> 31:04.000
LET ME GET THAT.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.200
TO THINK AFTER ALL
THESE MONTHS YOU WERE
HERE BY YOURSELF,

31:07.200 --> 31:08.400
IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.800
LISA, WE SHOULD TAKE
HENRY UPSTAIRS

31:15.800 --> 31:18.200
AND GET HIS SCHOOLWORK
TOGETHER FOR THE SOCIAL
WORKER TOMORROW.

31:18.300 --> 31:20.500
OH, WELL, I'LL COME UP
AND HELP YOU KIDS.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.800
THIS LOCK IS BROKEN.

31:32.900 --> 31:35.500
COULD YOU HAVE
MR. ALDEN FIX IT?

31:35.500 --> 31:38.000
OH, I'M NOT SURE.
I, UM--

31:38.000 --> 31:39.300
COULD YOU CALL HIM?

31:39.400 --> 31:40.700
BECAUSE IF THEY TAKE US
FROM THE HOUSE TOMORROW

31:40.800 --> 31:43.300
AND THE DOOR'S BROKEN,
SOMEONE MIGHT BREAK IN.

31:43.300 --> 31:44.600
OH, YEAH, OK.

31:44.700 --> 31:47.400
THANKS. COME ON,
GUYS, IT'S LATE.

31:51.700 --> 31:54.500
HI, HONEY,
CAN YOU CALL ME
ON THE CELL?

31:54.600 --> 31:56.200
I'M OVER HERE
WITH THOSE POOR--

31:59.400 --> 32:00.700
KIDS, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

32:00.800 --> 32:02.400
Amy: YEAH, WE'RE FINE.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.000
UM, THERE'S A FUSE BOX
IN THE CELLAR.

32:04.100 --> 32:06.000
CAN YOU GET IT?

32:06.000 --> 32:07.600
YEAH.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.500
YEAH, YEAH, HONEY,
I'LL GET IT.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.700
DID YOU GET THE TICKETS?
COME ON.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.100
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

32:32.100 --> 32:33.500
JUST WALK.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.200
THE CASHIER AT THE BUS STATION
CUT UP THE CREDIT CARD.

32:36.300 --> 32:38.000
"DECEASED," SHE SAID.

32:38.100 --> 32:39.600
I TOOK OFF BEFORE
SHE COULD CALL SECURITY.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.500
IT'S OK, WE STILL HAVE CASH.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.600
HOW MUCH CASH?
HOW LONG CAN IT LAST US?

32:43.700 --> 32:45.000
JUST KEEP WALKING.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GO,
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

32:46.100 --> 32:47.700
I DON'T KNOW.
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.900
WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE?

32:49.900 --> 32:51.200
WHAT ABOUT MOM
AND DAD'S STUFF?

32:51.200 --> 32:52.400
WHAT ABOUT
OUR LIFE HERE?

32:52.500 --> 32:54.700
DON'T YOU GET IT?
THAT'S ALREADY GONE.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.500
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE
IN THAT HOUSE.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.000
AND YOU CAN
PACK UP YOUR STUFF

32:58.100 --> 33:00.300
AND TAKE IT TO SOME
ORPHANAGE OR HALFWAY HOUSE

33:00.400 --> 33:02.900
OR WHATEVER WILL TAKE YOU.
ALL RIGHT, STOP.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.100
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

33:04.100 --> 33:05.700
YEAH, WELL,
YOU SHOULD BE SCARED.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.300
BECAUSE IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
WITH A NICE FAMILY

33:08.400 --> 33:12.200
WITH LISA TUCKING YOU IN
EVERY NIGHT, YOU'RE NOT.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.500
SHUT UP.

33:14.500 --> 33:15.800
LOOK...

33:15.900 --> 33:18.500
I'M ALMOST 18,
BUT YOU GUYS...

33:18.600 --> 33:20.500
WHO'S GOING TO WANT YOU?

33:20.600 --> 33:24.500
FREAKS WHO STUCK
THEIR OWN MOTHER
IN THE GROUND.

33:26.200 --> 33:30.300
NOW, I'M SCARED, TOO,
BUT THIS IS WHAT MOM
TOLD US TO DO.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.900
WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER,
WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
OK.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.700
WE HAVE TO GO.

33:38.700 --> 33:42.000
HENRY? HENRY?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.200
HENRY!
WHERE'D HE GO?

33:44.300 --> 33:46.400
HENRY?
HENRY?

33:50.800 --> 33:53.900
Henry: SORRY,
YOU GUYS.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
BUT I JUST CAN'T
DO THIS ANYMORE.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.200
Jim: OK.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.500
YEAH, MURPH
OVERHEARD THE A.D.A

34:01.600 --> 34:03.500
AND THE SOCIAL
WORKER TALKING.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.800
MEDICAL RECORDS
HAVE CONFIRMED
THEIR MOM HAD CANCER,

34:05.900 --> 34:07.500
NOBODY WANTS
TO PRESS CHARGES,

34:07.500 --> 34:09.300
BUT LOCKIN' UP
THE NEIGHBOR?

34:09.400 --> 34:11.199
IT WAS THE GHOST.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.400
YEAH, BUT THEY COULD
CHARGE AMY WITH A CRIME.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.800
TRY HER
AS AN ADULT.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.900
SHE'S HERE.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.800
CAN YOU GIVE ME
A SECOND?

34:19.900 --> 34:21.000
YEAH.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.000
THEY'RE SPLITTING THEM UP!

34:24.100 --> 34:25.900
HENRY'S GOING
TO SOME FOSTER HOME,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
WHILE AMY AND LISA
ARE BEING DETAINED.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.699
I KNEW IT!

34:29.800 --> 34:32.600
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
TO FAMILIES WHEN
BOTH PARENTS DIE!

34:32.699 --> 34:34.400
YOU CAN'T CONTROL
THEIR LIVES ANYMORE,

34:34.400 --> 34:35.800
AND EVERY TIME YOU DO,
YOU JUST MAKE IT WORSE.

34:35.800 --> 34:36.199
THE BEST

34:36.300 --> 34:37.900
HING
THAT YOU CAN DO

34:38.000 --> 34:39.900
IS JUST HELP THEM UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM.

34:39.900 --> 34:42.400
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND!

34:42.400 --> 34:44.900
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT,
BUT UNDERSTAND WHAT?

34:44.900 --> 34:47.600
WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

34:47.699 --> 34:49.400
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
OF SOMETHING,

34:49.500 --> 34:50.900
AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE COUNTY.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.600
<i>OR IS IT SOMEONE?</i>

34:56.400 --> 34:58.500
IS IT SOMEONE
WHO'D GET THEM
WHEN YOU DIED?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.700
I NEED TO TALK
TO THE OFFICER
WHO FOUND HENRY.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.100
SURE, WHAT'S UP?

35:07.200 --> 35:09.500
THIS GHOST
IS HIDING A LOT MORE
THAN HER DEATH.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.100
THE KIDS WOULD
GET TORN APART.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.600
ACTUALLY,
THE COUNTRY PREFERS TO
KEEP SIBLINGS TOGETHER.

35:19.700 --> 35:20.900
WHERE WAS SHE GETTING
HER INFORMATION?

35:20.900 --> 35:22.200
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I WAS WONDERING,

35:22.300 --> 35:24.300
BUT THEN IT MADE ME THINK,
WHAT IF SHE HAS SOMEONE?

35:25.400 --> 35:29.400
A SIBLING WHO IS IN
FOSTER CARE OR ADOPTED,

35:29.500 --> 35:30.500
SOMEONE THAT THE KIDS
NEVER KNEW?

35:30.500 --> 35:33.700
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
FAMILY SERVICES RECORDS.
THEY'RE SEALED.

35:33.700 --> 35:35.000
COME ON.
NOT FOR YOU.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.400
PLEASE.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.900
THAT LITTLE BOY
HAD EVERYTHING TO LOSE

35:39.000 --> 35:40.500
WHEN HE CAME
TO YOU FOR HELP.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.800
HE'S LOST SO MUCH ALREADY.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.400
HI, ARE YOU
TRACY EDMONDSON?

35:56.309 --> 35:57.509
YES.

35:57.609 --> 35:59.109
MY NAME IS
MELINDA GORDON.

35:59.109 --> 36:01.809
I KNEW
YOUR SISTER KAREN.

36:01.809 --> 36:04.709
MY SISTER?

36:09.009 --> 36:10.609
THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS.

36:10.709 --> 36:12.509
I...

36:12.509 --> 36:16.609
I'M NOT HONESTLY SURE
I WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWERS.

36:16.709 --> 36:18.309
SHE HAD 3 CHILDREN.

36:19.509 --> 36:22.009
THEIR FATHER DIED, TOO.
THEY HAVE NO ONE.

36:24.809 --> 36:26.509
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT,
DID YOU?

36:26.609 --> 36:30.509
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF
THE PEOPLE SHE ASKED
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

36:30.509 --> 36:32.709
SHE PROBABLY FIGURED
I'D SAY NO.

36:32.809 --> 36:36.009
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
TAKE HER WHEN
YOUR PARENTS DIED?

36:37.409 --> 36:39.309
I KNOW ABOUT
THE ACCIDENT.

36:39.309 --> 36:42.609
I KNOW THAT YOU WERE 19
WHEN YOU LOST THEM.

36:42.609 --> 36:46.409
YOU WERE OLD ENOUGH
TO TAKE OVER CUSTODY.

36:47.809 --> 36:49.709
I SAT IN A COURTROOM

36:49.809 --> 36:54.109
WHILE THE JUDGE
ASKED HER OVER AND OVER
IF SHE WANTED ME.

36:54.209 --> 36:56.109
SHE CRIED EVERY NIGHT

36:56.209 --> 36:59.509
UNTIL SHE PASSED OUT
FROM EXHAUSTION.

36:59.509 --> 37:02.409
AND THEY WERE MY PARENTS, TOO.
I COULD BARELY FUNCTION.

37:02.509 --> 37:04.709
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO FIX
HER BROKEN HEART?

37:04.709 --> 37:07.009
I DON'T THINK ANYONE
EXPECTED YOU TO DO THAT.

37:07.009 --> 37:08.809
EXCEPT MAYBE YOU.

37:08.909 --> 37:13.209
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE NOW.
SHE'S GONE.

37:13.209 --> 37:15.409
WHAT IF IT WASN'T
TOO LATE?

37:15.509 --> 37:18.009
JUST MEET HER KIDS.

37:18.109 --> 37:19.809
THEY'RE REALLY...

37:19.909 --> 37:22.909
[SIGHS] REALLY
SELF SUFFICIENT
AND LOVING.

37:22.909 --> 37:26.209
AND THEY NEED YOU
TO BE THEIR FAMILY.

37:26.309 --> 37:28.809
LEGALLY, IT'S
THE ONLY WAY THEY
CAN STAY TOGETHER.

37:28.909 --> 37:31.209
SHE IS A COMPLETE
STRANGER TO THEM.

37:31.209 --> 37:33.509
I'M NOT THEIR FAMILY.

37:33.609 --> 37:37.209
IF KAREN WERE HERE,
SHE'D TELL YOU
I'M NOT HER FAMILY.

37:37.209 --> 37:39.409
I GAVE UP THAT RIGHT.

37:39.509 --> 37:41.409
LISTEN TO HER.
SHE'S RIGHT.

37:41.409 --> 37:43.509
SO...

37:43.509 --> 37:46.009
I CAN'T.

37:46.109 --> 37:48.409
I DON'T...

37:48.509 --> 37:50.109
DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE?

37:56.209 --> 37:58.109
YOU ALL DO.

38:02.509 --> 38:03.909
HEY.
HEY.

38:04.009 --> 38:05.209
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:05.309 --> 38:06.809
OH, I'M JUST
PICKING UP NED.

38:06.809 --> 38:10.309
HE WANTED TO HELP LISA'S
AUNT MOVE THE REST
OF HER STUFF IN.

38:10.409 --> 38:11.809
ARE YOU GUYS OK?

38:11.809 --> 38:14.409
I MEAN, DID HE EVER APOLOGIZE
FOR JUST WALKING OUT?

38:14.409 --> 38:17.109
NO, ACTUALLY,
I APOLOGIZED TO HIM.

38:17.109 --> 38:19.309
YEAH, HE WAS RIGHT.

38:19.409 --> 38:24.309
IT WAS JUST VERY HARD FOR ME
TO THINK OF HIM...DATING.

38:26.509 --> 38:29.509
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE LOOKING THIS WAY?

38:29.609 --> 38:31.709
'CAUSE YOU LITERALLY
CAN'T FACE THE IDEA

38:31.809 --> 38:33.009
OF NED HAVING A GIRLFRIEND?

38:33.109 --> 38:36.009
NO, I AM TRYING
TO GIVE THEM
THEIR PRIVACY.

38:36.009 --> 38:39.309
THIS IS ME...
LETTING GO.

38:39.309 --> 38:42.109
SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
ARE THEY KISSING?

38:42.209 --> 38:43.809
UH, NO, SHE JUST
HIT HIM.

38:43.909 --> 38:45.109
OH, THANK GOD.

38:45.109 --> 38:47.409
BUT IT WAS FULL
OF SEXUAL TENSION.

38:47.509 --> 38:51.209
NED, COME ON, LET'S GO!
WE'RE LATE FOR PRACTICE!

38:52.309 --> 38:54.309
WHAT?

38:54.409 --> 38:56.809
WE ARE!

38:56.909 --> 38:58.209
I DON'T KNOW, MELINDA.

38:58.209 --> 39:00.009
I THINK THEY JUST
WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE.

39:00.109 --> 39:01.409
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

39:01.509 --> 39:02.809
I REMEMBER WHEN DAD CAME
TO PICK YOU UP,

39:02.909 --> 39:04.709
AND YOU HAD ALL THAT GUM
STUCK IN YOUR BRACES.

39:04.709 --> 39:08.009
YEAH, BUT I WON THE CONTEST.
YEAH.

39:08.009 --> 39:12.009
OK, NOW MOM. I REMEMBER MOM
TAKING HENRY TO WORK ONE DAY.

39:12.109 --> 39:14.909
Lisa: I LOVE THIS ONE.

39:14.909 --> 39:17.009
YOU WERE LIKE, THREE,

39:17.109 --> 39:20.209
AND YOU GAVE HER COMPUTER
A BIG DRINK OF GRAPE JUICE.

39:29.409 --> 39:32.109
PLEASE DON'T STOP
BECAUSE OF ME.

39:32.209 --> 39:35.709
OH, NO. IT'S JUST
A FAMILY THING WE DO,

39:35.709 --> 39:37.209
JUST THE THREE OF US.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.309
TELL HER TRACY
IS HER FAMILY.

39:39.409 --> 39:42.809
TELL HER SHE MIGHT
REMEMBER SOME THINGS
THEY'LL WANT TO HEAR.

39:42.909 --> 39:45.009
AMY, UH...

39:45.109 --> 39:49.009
YOUR MOM WANTS YOU
TO LET YOUR AUNT PLAY.

39:49.109 --> 39:51.809
Lisa: WAIT,
MOM'S HERE?

39:51.909 --> 39:53.909
WHERE IS SHE?

39:59.109 --> 40:01.709
I REMEMBER...

40:03.409 --> 40:06.409
I REMEMBER MAKING UP
A GAME WITH YOUR MOTHER.

40:07.809 --> 40:10.609
IT WAS CALLED
"I REMEMBER."

40:10.609 --> 40:13.309
SWEETHEART,
LISTEN.

40:13.309 --> 40:15.909
'CAUSE AFTER OUR
PARENTS DIED,

40:16.009 --> 40:18.709
I TOLD YOUR MOTHER
TO REMEMBER ONE THING

40:18.709 --> 40:22.309
ABOUT EACH OF THEM
EVERY NIGHT BEFORE
SHE WENT TO SLEEP,

40:22.409 --> 40:25.509
AND THAT WAY,
THEY WOULD BE
WITH HER ALWAYS.

40:25.609 --> 40:28.009
EVEN IF I COULDN'T BE.

40:30.509 --> 40:33.409
<i>YOU MADE UP THE GAME?</i>

40:33.509 --> 40:35.609
MM-HMM.

40:35.709 --> 40:37.609
TELL THEM TO LISTEN
TO THEIR AUNT,

40:37.709 --> 40:39.209
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
THE STORY

40:39.309 --> 40:41.709
ABOUT WHEN WE CAMPED OUT
ON COPPER ISLAND
WITH MOM AND DAD.

40:41.809 --> 40:43.309
TRACY...

40:43.309 --> 40:46.709
CAN YOU TELL THEM THE STORY
ABOUT CAMPING

40:46.709 --> 40:48.409
ON COPPER ISLAND?

40:48.409 --> 40:51.609
OH, COME ON,
AUNT TRACY!
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

40:51.709 --> 40:53.509
'CAUSE MOM ALWAYS
HATED CAMPING.

40:55.009 --> 40:58.409
WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK
SHE LEARNED TO HATE IT?

40:58.409 --> 41:03.309
I REMEMBER YOUR MOTHER,
A ROPE SWING,

41:03.309 --> 41:06.109
AND A GIANT BED
OF POISON IVY

41:06.209 --> 41:09.909
THAT SHE FELL INTO,
AND GOT POISON IVY

41:10.009 --> 41:13.109
FOR THE WHOLE REST
OF THE CAMPING VACATION,

41:13.209 --> 41:15.809
SO THAT MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

41:15.809 --> 41:18.209
[FADING] SO, THERE WAS THIS
GIANT BED OF POISON IVY,

41:18.209 --> 41:20.609
AND I HEARD THERE WAS
POISON IVY ON THE ISLAND,

41:20.709 --> 41:22.109
BUT NOBODY HAD THOUGHT
TO POINT IT OUT.

41:29.009 --> 41:31.609
BOOM, JUST LIKE THAT.

41:31.609 --> 41:34.709
SO THE POISON IVY THING,
LIKE, WAS ALL OVER US BOTH.

41:34.809 --> 41:36.309
WE WERE ITCHING.

41:36.409 --> 41:39.909
AND, OH, SHE HAD IT
ALL OVER HER BODY.

41:40.009 --> 41:42.409
IT REALLY WAS DIFFICULT.

41:42.509 --> 41:44.009
Henry: THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN SO FUNNY.

41:46.509 --> 41:48.909
WHAT IS THAT?

41:48.909 --> 41:51.109
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

41:53.709 --> 41:56.109
IT'S TIME, ISN'T IT?

41:56.209 --> 41:59.109
ONLY YOU KNOW THAT.

42:09.509 --> 42:15.109
I REMEMBER YOUR MOTHER,
A ROPE SWING, AND A GIANT
BED OF POISON IVY.

42:17.109 --> 42:20.309
YEAH, SHE WANTED
TO RIDE THIS ROPE SWING,

42:20.409 --> 42:22.509
WITH, YOU KNOW,
JUST A LITTLE KNOT
AT THE END,

42:22.509 --> 42:24.509
AND I HAD BEEN TOLD
THERE WAS POISON IVY...

42:27.609 --> 42:29.709
THERE'S ROOM OVER HERE,
AUNT TRACY.

42:29.809 --> 42:30.700
Amy: COME ON, TRACY.
SIT DOWN.

42:30.800 --> 42:33.100
Henry: YEAH, TELL US MORE.

42:33.100 --> 42:35.600
SO, ONE DAY
WE WENT OUT,
AND, OF COURSE,

42:35.700 --> 42:37.800
SHE WANTS TO CLIMB
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
OF THE CLIFFS,

42:37.900 --> 42:40.200
AND SO SHE'S CLIMBING
THESE CLIFFS,

42:40.300 --> 42:42.200
AND I'M LIKE,
"STOP, STOP!"

42:42.300 --> 42:44.900
BECAUSE I'M THE OLDER
SISTER, I'M SUPPOSED
TO TAKE CARE OF HER,

42:44.900 --> 42:46.500
AND SHE'S GOING OFF
THESE CLIFFS...
