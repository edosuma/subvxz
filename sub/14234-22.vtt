00:00.068 --> 00:01.401
Previously on
<i>The Event.</i>

00:01.454 --> 00:03.042
I have no idea what it says.

00:03.043 --> 00:04.210
If he could read it,

00:04.278 --> 00:05.511
Dempsey knew more than
what he was telling you

00:05.579 --> 00:07.780
about why we're here
and about what happened.

00:07.848 --> 00:09.382
Our star has begun
to implode.

00:09.449 --> 00:11.217
We will bring
all of our people here

00:11.284 --> 00:12.479
and make this planet our own.

00:12.547 --> 00:14.537
She's doing what
she has to to save us.

00:14.605 --> 00:15.943
By committing genocide.

00:16.012 --> 00:17.243
We need to make room.

00:17.311 --> 00:19.546
The most efficient way
to spread the pathogen

00:19.614 --> 00:22.712
is by using three parallel
distribution channels.

00:22.780 --> 00:26.486
Within five weeks the vast
majority of the human population

00:26.554 --> 00:27.525
will be dead.

00:27.592 --> 00:28.764
I know about the virus.

00:28.832 --> 00:30.299
They used me
as a way to change it.

00:30.367 --> 00:31.535
I'm gonna get you
out of there.

00:31.603 --> 00:32.537
- You can't!
- What?

00:32.604 --> 00:33.879
I'm infected.

00:33.947 --> 00:35.881
Everything we need to know
about stopping the virus

00:35.949 --> 00:37.052
is on there.

00:37.119 --> 00:38.456
That's a lot of data
to sort through.

00:38.524 --> 00:39.793
The answer's right here.

00:39.860 --> 00:41.027
We're just gonna have to
figure it out on our own.

00:41.095 --> 00:42.095
The President is awake.

00:42.162 --> 00:43.497
Mr. President,
open your eyes, sir.

00:43.564 --> 00:45.533
Outstanding, sir. Yes.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.767
I know you tried to kill me.

00:46.835 --> 00:48.603
I am the President
of the United States.

00:48.671 --> 00:49.937
Not for long.

00:50.005 --> 00:51.305
There needs to be a vote
that you're capable.

00:51.373 --> 00:54.341
You can barely stand,
let alone lead this country.

00:54.409 --> 00:56.877
We just got word from home.
Our people are ready to come.

00:56.945 --> 00:58.612
Your job is to power
the array.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.314
Ready to activate
on your order.

01:00.382 --> 01:02.449
Proceed.

01:06.089 --> 01:08.224
Hey, Leila, stay with me.

01:08.292 --> 01:09.226
Leila.

01:09.293 --> 01:11.530
You have to stay awake, okay?

01:11.598 --> 01:14.034
Sterling called a specialist
at the CDC under the radar.

01:14.101 --> 01:16.505
He said they'll be here
any minute.

01:16.573 --> 01:17.507
Okay?

01:17.575 --> 01:19.209
It's too late for me.

01:19.276 --> 01:21.578
You have to worry about
everyone else.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.346
It's not too late.

01:23.414 --> 01:24.683
You can't think like that.

01:24.750 --> 01:28.386
Sean, I know what
this virus does.

01:28.454 --> 01:31.390
They said no one
can survive it.

01:31.458 --> 01:34.159
No. Simon said that
his people are immune to it.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.595
You share some of that DNA,
so...

01:36.662 --> 01:39.431
You have it within you
to fight this.

01:39.498 --> 01:43.568
Please...find Sam.

01:43.636 --> 01:46.471
Make sure she's okay.

01:46.539 --> 01:47.472
Leila.

01:47.540 --> 01:48.875
Hey. Stay with me.

01:48.943 --> 01:49.910
Leila.

01:49.978 --> 01:52.948
Leila!

01:53.015 --> 01:55.184
Oh, thank God.

01:55.252 --> 01:58.120
She's dehydrated,
she's very weak.

01:58.188 --> 01:59.622
How long has she been
symptomatic?

01:59.689 --> 02:02.091
Uh, I don't know, a day,
maybe two or three.

02:02.159 --> 02:05.529
Put her in a suit,
get her ready for transport.

02:05.597 --> 02:07.431
We're gonna take
good care of her.

02:07.499 --> 02:08.967
We need to get her
to a proper facility.

02:09.035 --> 02:10.134
And you need to leave the area.

02:10.203 --> 02:12.305
Okay.

02:12.372 --> 02:13.306
Leila?

02:13.374 --> 02:14.374
I'll find you, okay?

02:14.441 --> 02:15.742
It's gonna be fine.

02:15.810 --> 02:19.380
I'll be there.
Everything's gonna be okay.

02:19.448 --> 02:21.983
They built a model projecting
the spread of the disease

02:22.050 --> 02:23.618
over the next five weeks.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.019
Running the projection
backwards

02:25.087 --> 02:26.621
tells us where the attacks
will originate.

02:26.689 --> 02:30.225
By 5:30 today the pathogen
will have been released

02:30.293 --> 02:31.727
at these three locations:

02:31.795 --> 02:35.164
A food processing plant outside
of Richmond, Virginia;

02:35.231 --> 02:38.534
the U.S. Bureau
of Engraving in D.C.;

02:38.601 --> 02:41.603
and the international terminal
at Dulles Airport.

02:41.671 --> 02:43.071
Food, money, and travel.

02:43.139 --> 02:45.207
Within days it will be
everywhere.

02:45.275 --> 02:46.977
Do we know what kind of
delivery mechanisms

02:47.044 --> 02:47.978
they're using?

02:48.045 --> 02:49.446
Yeah. These.

02:49.513 --> 02:52.483
Pressurized aerosol
containers.

02:52.551 --> 02:54.485
We have to assume they're
either on their way

02:54.553 --> 02:57.856
or already in place
at the three locations.

03:02.696 --> 03:03.863
Teams one and two
are in place,

03:03.930 --> 03:05.431
prepping canisters
for release,

03:05.498 --> 03:06.632
no delays or disruptions.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.468
All right,
pull over here.

03:09.536 --> 03:11.137
Is there a problem?

03:11.205 --> 03:13.439
It'll be safer
if we're stopped.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.083 --> 03:24.016
Sophia.

03:24.084 --> 03:25.384
What are we doing here?

03:54.152 --> 03:55.085
How did you know?

03:55.153 --> 03:56.520
Gerard.

03:56.588 --> 03:59.690
He said the portal would
impact the Earth's procession,

03:59.758 --> 04:03.060
that we'd feel the effects
along the 38th parallel

04:03.128 --> 04:04.462
as the time grew near.

04:04.530 --> 04:06.764
The portal is creating a door
in the fabric of space

04:06.832 --> 04:09.067
and we just cracked it open.

04:09.134 --> 04:12.805
Sophia...I know you have
mixed feelings

04:12.873 --> 04:15.508
about what we're doing
to the native population.

04:15.575 --> 04:17.877
But think about the alternative.

04:17.945 --> 04:20.313
Our people are arriving soon.

04:20.380 --> 04:24.017
I don't have the luxury
of self-doubt.

04:24.084 --> 04:26.319
We have to get this done.

04:46.443 --> 04:49.621
A small earthquake, measuring
4.6 on the Richter scale,

04:49.734 --> 04:51.569
was felt along
the East Coast today.

04:51.636 --> 04:54.305
There have been no reports
of injuries or deaths.

04:54.372 --> 04:56.540
Geologists say
the tremor is of note

04:56.607 --> 04:58.575
for one very peculiar reason.

04:58.643 --> 05:00.676
They have yet
to identify any fault

05:00.744 --> 05:02.678
that would explain
how the quake originated.

05:02.745 --> 05:04.513
Scientists are baffled

05:04.580 --> 05:06.548
by the swarm of
similar magnitude quakes

05:06.615 --> 05:08.783
that have shaken several
other areas around the globe.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.785
It's Sterling.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.719
He's with Simon.

05:12.787 --> 05:14.488
You're on with
the President.

05:14.555 --> 05:16.590
Mr. President,
we need your help.

05:16.658 --> 05:19.025
We've determined Sophia's
releasing the virus

05:19.093 --> 05:21.928
at a food processing plant
outside of Richmond,

05:21.996 --> 05:23.563
the Bureau of Engraving,

05:23.631 --> 05:25.866
and the Dulles Airport
International Terminal.

05:25.933 --> 05:27.234
My God.

05:27.301 --> 05:29.068
We need you to dispatch
counterterrorism teams

05:29.136 --> 05:31.004
to these locations
immediately.

05:31.071 --> 05:33.840
Jarvis is challenging
my reinstatement.

05:33.907 --> 05:36.609
And I am forcing
a vote of the Cabinet.

05:36.677 --> 05:40.078
I can't issue any orders
until that happens.

05:40.146 --> 05:41.779
What's the timeframe?

05:41.847 --> 05:43.414
It'll take another hour
to gather the Cabinet.

05:43.482 --> 05:44.649
Maybe two.

05:44.716 --> 05:46.383
By then it may be too late.

05:46.451 --> 05:49.620
We can launch
contained operations

05:49.687 --> 05:50.687
at the Bureau of Engraving

05:50.755 --> 05:52.722
and the food
processing plant.

05:52.790 --> 05:55.893
And as Chief of Staff, Richard,
you can send teams in

05:55.961 --> 05:58.763
via written orders from
the Office of the President.

05:58.831 --> 06:00.131
Jarvis wouldn't
have to know.

06:00.199 --> 06:01.633
No.

06:01.701 --> 06:04.203
Now, shutting down a terminal
at an international airport,

06:04.270 --> 06:05.537
that's another matter.

06:05.605 --> 06:07.773
Well, we need to do something
one way or another.

06:07.841 --> 06:09.976
If Sophia succeeds
in infecting passengers

06:10.044 --> 06:11.477
and they travel
to other countries,

06:11.545 --> 06:14.780
there will be no way to stop
the spread of this virus.

06:17.050 --> 06:20.219
President Martinez and Peel
are doing everything they can,

06:20.287 --> 06:22.789
but it looks like
it may be up to us

06:22.857 --> 06:24.658
to stop Sophia's operation
at the airport.

06:24.725 --> 06:27.527
Us? Four people?
How are we supposed to do that?

06:27.595 --> 06:28.628
We can call in a bomb threat.

06:28.696 --> 06:29.996
Shut the airport down that way.

06:30.064 --> 06:31.932
Even if it worked,
as soon as we actually started

06:32.000 --> 06:33.166
to shut the place down

06:33.234 --> 06:34.968
Sophia could still
release the virus

06:35.036 --> 06:36.403
and infect everyone
in the terminal.

06:36.470 --> 06:38.639
Our only option
is to get there,

06:38.706 --> 06:40.474
stay under the radar,

06:40.542 --> 06:42.476
and try to locate Sophia
ourselves.

06:45.147 --> 06:47.315
I need to speak with you.

06:49.351 --> 06:50.618
Uh, give us a minute.

06:50.686 --> 06:51.719
Yes, sir.

06:56.491 --> 06:58.726
If you're trying to
convince me to step down again,

06:58.794 --> 07:00.194
don't waste your breath.

07:00.262 --> 07:02.296
It's up to the Cabinet now.

07:02.364 --> 07:04.064
And I think we both know
what they'll decide

07:04.132 --> 07:05.733
when they see
the condition you're in.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.034
Oh, forget about
the vote, Ray.

07:07.102 --> 07:09.336
All I care about
is saving this country

07:09.404 --> 07:11.138
and stopping Sophia
from doing something--

07:11.205 --> 07:13.807
Sophia doesn't
need to be stopped.

07:13.875 --> 07:16.176
I negotiated a peace with her.

07:16.244 --> 07:18.812
You need to shut down
the international terminal

07:18.880 --> 07:21.649
at Dulles and send in
a bio-containment team

07:21.717 --> 07:22.750
immediately.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.520
What are you talking about?
Why?

07:25.588 --> 07:30.225
She is planning to release
a deadly virus there--

07:30.293 --> 07:34.397
so her people can take
this planet for themselves.

07:34.464 --> 07:36.232
That's ridiculous.

07:36.299 --> 07:37.400
She wouldn't do that.

07:37.467 --> 07:41.536
I know it's a lot
for you to accept.

07:41.604 --> 07:42.704
She's been lying to you.

07:42.771 --> 07:43.771
That's not true.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.640
I swear on everything
I hold dear,

07:45.708 --> 07:47.074
I am telling you the truth.

07:47.142 --> 07:48.409
Why else, on earth,

07:48.476 --> 07:50.044
would I be asking you
to shut down the airport?

07:50.111 --> 07:51.412
To make me
look like a fool.

07:51.479 --> 07:54.247
Like I'm not in control
of the situation with Sophia

07:54.315 --> 07:56.616
so the Cabinet will look past
your medical problems

07:56.684 --> 07:57.851
and reinstate you.

07:57.918 --> 08:00.520
Ray...I'm willing
to make a deal

08:00.588 --> 08:03.389
to let you finish your term

08:03.457 --> 08:06.192
by keeping the truth of what
you've done between us.

08:06.260 --> 08:09.362
Now, you do nothing,

08:09.430 --> 08:11.164
I'll expose you
to the Cabinet,

08:11.232 --> 08:12.866
tell them everything
you've done.

08:14.769 --> 08:17.671
Do you really think
the Cabinet would believe

08:17.738 --> 08:20.640
that I poisoned you
to make a deal with Sophia?

08:20.708 --> 08:23.110
You have no proof
of what I did to you

08:23.177 --> 08:25.379
or the arrangements
I made with Sophia

08:25.447 --> 08:26.714
or you would have used it.

08:26.782 --> 08:29.417
You'll only look crazy

08:29.484 --> 08:30.718
and prove my point

08:30.786 --> 08:33.854
that you're in no shape
to lead this country.

08:36.158 --> 08:38.325
I'll see you at the vote.

08:58.745 --> 09:00.946
- Sophia.
- Raymond, what is it?

09:01.014 --> 09:02.415
Martinez just confronted me.

09:02.482 --> 09:05.518
And he--he made accusations.

09:05.585 --> 09:06.686
About what?

09:06.753 --> 09:09.488
That you are about
to release a virus

09:09.556 --> 09:12.125
on American soil.

09:12.193 --> 09:14.494
When was this?

09:14.562 --> 09:16.629
Just now--is it true?

09:16.697 --> 09:18.965
Of course not.

09:19.032 --> 09:20.466
How do I know you're
not lying to me?

09:20.534 --> 09:22.434
That you haven't been lying
to me from the very beginning?

09:22.502 --> 09:23.702
Listen to me.

09:23.770 --> 09:26.538
Tomorrow there will be
a new world order

09:26.606 --> 09:27.806
with your guiding hand.

09:27.874 --> 09:30.208
You only need to hang on

09:30.276 --> 09:32.310
for one more day.

09:32.378 --> 09:34.546
Do you understand?

09:34.614 --> 09:35.748
Yes.

09:35.816 --> 09:38.117
You must not let anyone
get in our way.

09:38.185 --> 09:39.352
Can you do that?

09:39.419 --> 09:40.353
Yes.

09:40.421 --> 09:42.556
I chose you

09:42.623 --> 09:44.024
because of your strength.

09:44.092 --> 09:45.459
Your power.

09:45.527 --> 09:47.161
Use it.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.169
We may have a problem.

09:54.236 --> 09:56.003
They know.

09:56.071 --> 09:57.671
Somehow they know.

10:15.254 --> 10:16.521
I'll get these
around security,

10:16.589 --> 10:17.956
hand them back off
to you and Carlos

10:18.024 --> 10:19.791
inside the terminal.
Good.

10:19.859 --> 10:21.226
It might be better for us
to stay out of sight

10:21.294 --> 10:22.461
for the exchange.

10:22.528 --> 10:24.195
This card will get you
past the security door

10:24.263 --> 10:25.196
near gate 122.

10:25.264 --> 10:26.431
Code's on the back.

10:26.498 --> 10:28.367
Go through the hallway.

10:28.434 --> 10:30.402
We'll meet back there in time
for the 5:30 release.

10:30.469 --> 10:32.304
No, they've found out.
We can't afford to wait.

10:32.371 --> 10:34.673
As soon as each of us
has our canister in place

10:34.740 --> 10:36.774
we'll release the virus
immediately.

10:52.215 --> 10:53.549
I'm here at the base
of Mt. Shasta,

10:53.616 --> 10:56.218
where volcanic experts
are stumped

10:56.286 --> 10:57.452
by reports of
new lava flows

10:57.520 --> 11:00.489
coming from this
thought-to-be-dormant volcano.

11:00.556 --> 11:02.557
Concerns of a full-scale
eruption

11:02.625 --> 11:03.858
are growing among locals.

11:03.926 --> 11:07.262
But so far, no official
mention of an evacuation.

11:12.636 --> 11:15.171
Teams are on their way
to two of the three sites.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.441
But the airport is still
the most lethal part

11:17.508 --> 11:18.542
of Sophia's plan.

11:18.610 --> 11:20.477
Any word from Sterling
or Agent Lee?

11:20.545 --> 11:21.679
They're on their way

11:21.746 --> 11:23.614
with two civilians
who are helping them.

11:23.682 --> 11:25.683
But even they believe
the odds of success to be small.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.018
The Cabinet
has to reinstate me.

11:27.085 --> 11:28.018
It's our only chance.

11:28.086 --> 11:31.021
Yes, sir.

11:31.089 --> 11:32.522
Elias.

11:32.590 --> 11:34.057
You can't do this.

11:34.125 --> 11:35.592
You're not well enough yet.

11:35.660 --> 11:38.494
It looks worse than it is.

11:38.562 --> 11:39.995
You heard what
the doctor said.

11:40.063 --> 11:44.433
If you don't rest,
you can--

11:44.501 --> 11:45.901
you can die.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.103
Freeze!

12:34.785 --> 12:37.486
Once the canisters are
connected to the auxiliary well,

12:37.554 --> 12:39.021
I can direct the control
room to switch over.

12:39.088 --> 12:40.822
How much money can we infect
with the virus?

12:40.890 --> 12:43.425
As long as the presses
continue rolling--

12:52.000 --> 12:53.434
Blue team, go!

12:53.502 --> 12:55.703
The rest of you,
secure the canisters.

13:06.981 --> 13:09.149
I see. All right.

13:09.217 --> 13:10.584
That was Peel.

13:10.651 --> 13:12.753
The President wasn't able
to get anywhere with Jarvis.

13:12.820 --> 13:14.054
We're on our own.

13:14.121 --> 13:15.355
From what I saw
on their laptop,

13:15.423 --> 13:16.723
an inside man is supposed
to get the canisters

13:16.790 --> 13:18.391
past security for Sophia

13:18.459 --> 13:20.527
through an off-limits area
near baggage claim three.

13:20.595 --> 13:22.596
All right, Agent Lee and I
will follow that route.

13:22.664 --> 13:24.498
Sophia's supposed to meet them
in the international terminal,

13:24.566 --> 13:26.200
so we'll look for her there.

13:32.207 --> 13:35.876
Baggage claim three is now
loading from Bangkok...

13:35.944 --> 13:36.877
Hey, Eddie.

13:36.944 --> 13:38.578
Will.

13:43.451 --> 13:46.019
Confiscate anything good?

13:46.087 --> 13:47.087
Hey!

13:47.155 --> 13:49.923
You mind if I take these?

13:49.991 --> 13:51.859
Me and the wife like
to keep things invigorating.

13:51.926 --> 13:53.526
Oh, too much information.
Just keep 'em.

14:01.334 --> 14:04.168
This is your final call
for Flight 308 to Amsterdam...

14:08.995 --> 14:10.663
Yeah,
just move them through.

14:10.731 --> 14:11.764
Step through.

14:17.738 --> 14:19.005
Ma'am...

14:19.073 --> 14:21.008
Grab your luggage
and step over here, please.

14:21.076 --> 14:24.378
- Is there a problem?
- Random check.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.815
I don't have any bags.
I checked everything.

14:30.485 --> 14:33.520
On the yellow mark, please.

14:33.588 --> 14:34.788
Arms out.

14:42.830 --> 14:44.131
Not while you're being
checked, ma'am.

14:44.198 --> 14:45.132
Sorry.

14:50.638 --> 14:53.240
- You're fine, ma'am.
- Thank you.

14:57.879 --> 14:59.179
- Hello?
- They knew we were here.

14:59.247 --> 15:01.014
They stopped us before
we could release the virus.

15:01.082 --> 15:04.184
I'm sorry, Sophia.
We were outgunned.

15:04.252 --> 15:06.787
What about the food plant?
What about Aaron?

15:06.854 --> 15:09.456
I haven't been able
to reach him.

15:11.391 --> 15:14.360
We got him! We got him!

15:14.428 --> 15:16.662
It's up to you now, Sophia.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.664
Freeze!

15:18.731 --> 15:21.299
Devon?

15:23.769 --> 15:25.203
Devon?

15:39.185 --> 15:40.786
The attack at the Bureau
of Engraving was stopped.

15:40.854 --> 15:42.287
Some of the pathogen
was released

15:42.355 --> 15:43.789
at the food-processing plant,

15:43.857 --> 15:45.458
but it was contained
by the biohazard team.

15:45.525 --> 15:46.992
Good.
And the airport?

15:47.060 --> 15:50.762
Nothing yet.

16:01.372 --> 16:03.739
You okay?

16:15.051 --> 16:17.319
Sir.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.523
Baggage Claim Three is now close.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.250
Please collect unclaimed bags
at the main office

16:29.318 --> 16:31.786
in Concourse Two.

16:35.424 --> 16:36.991
I'm looking for a man
with TSA credentials.

16:37.059 --> 16:38.493
Would've just passed this way.

16:38.561 --> 16:40.695
This man is carrying
a biological weapon

16:40.763 --> 16:43.197
he's going to release
inside the terminal.

16:43.265 --> 16:44.966
Are you law enforcement?
You have some I.D.?

16:45.033 --> 16:47.001
My name is Blake Sterling.

16:47.069 --> 16:48.703
I'm the Director
of National Intelligence.

16:48.771 --> 16:50.839
Now, answer the question.
Listen...

16:50.906 --> 16:54.108
You show me some I.D., or I'm
gonna have you two arrested.

16:54.176 --> 16:56.677
Count of three--
did he come this way or not?

16:56.745 --> 16:58.212
Yeah.

16:58.280 --> 17:01.115
Yeah, Delgado came by a minute
ago with a cart of stuff.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.709
I've got a visual.

17:29.646 --> 17:30.846
Freeze!

17:34.050 --> 17:35.150
Cover me.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.747
Simon!

18:17.593 --> 18:20.728
The vest...

18:20.796 --> 18:22.430
took the impact.

18:22.497 --> 18:25.133
I'll be all right.

18:26.935 --> 18:28.970
Ah, damn it.

18:33.709 --> 18:35.476
Yeah?

18:35.543 --> 18:38.112
We had a visual on
Sophia's man, but we lost him--

18:38.180 --> 18:40.682
5'9", dark hair,
tsa uniform.

18:40.750 --> 18:41.817
We need a location.

18:41.884 --> 18:43.385
He's headed up
in the elevator

18:43.452 --> 18:45.319
to gates 120 to 140,
back of house.

18:45.387 --> 18:46.721
He has the canisters.

18:46.788 --> 18:50.691
We need to find a way
to get into the secured side.

19:14.615 --> 19:16.382
Two men right behind me--
I shot one of them.

19:16.450 --> 19:18.117
I think it was Simon.
We have to hurry.

19:18.185 --> 19:19.719
You know where
to take the canisters

19:19.786 --> 19:21.287
for maximum distribution.

19:21.355 --> 19:23.389
- What if we're challenged?
- Don't wait. Open the valves.

19:23.457 --> 19:24.557
Go.

19:24.625 --> 19:25.692
Sophia.

19:35.770 --> 19:36.937
Go!
I'll cover you!

19:39.440 --> 19:40.607
Go!

19:47.448 --> 19:49.950
I'll take him.

19:58.292 --> 19:59.893
Ugh!

20:11.841 --> 20:13.108
He's down.

20:13.175 --> 20:14.943
Where's Sophia?

20:15.011 --> 20:17.146
She went that way.

20:25.122 --> 20:26.622
You go that way.

20:32.329 --> 20:36.198
As much as I'd like to give
Eli the benefit of the doubt,

20:36.266 --> 20:38.567
there have been earthquakes
all across the country.

20:38.635 --> 20:41.203
- We're in crisis mode.
- I understand.

20:47.143 --> 20:48.911
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:48.978 --> 20:51.413
without the attendance
of President Martinez,

20:51.481 --> 20:53.749
I have no choice
but to formally withdraw

20:53.817 --> 20:55.684
his petition
for reinstatement.

20:55.752 --> 20:58.620
Acting President Jarvis
will continue in his role

20:58.688 --> 20:59.921
until further notice.

20:59.989 --> 21:03.091
Please advise your st...

21:14.503 --> 21:17.105
Members of the Cabinet...

21:17.173 --> 21:20.209
Mr. Vice President...

21:20.276 --> 21:22.811
Let's begin.

21:38.061 --> 21:39.194
I think it's safe to say

21:39.262 --> 21:42.164
that, uh, none of us
would be here today

21:42.231 --> 21:44.333
without Elias Martinez.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.768
Elias Martinez is one
of the greatest presidents

21:46.836 --> 21:48.136
of my generation.

21:48.204 --> 21:51.940
And I look forward to the day
when he is able to serve

21:52.008 --> 21:54.576
this country once again.

21:54.644 --> 21:57.679
But today is not that day.

21:57.747 --> 22:01.684
Please refer to the dossiers
that you have in front of you.

22:01.751 --> 22:04.854
These are
the current medical records

22:04.922 --> 22:06.522
of President Martinez.

22:06.590 --> 22:10.093
As you will note on page 3,
paragraph 4,

22:10.161 --> 22:12.763
President Martinez
wasn't officially cleared

22:12.830 --> 22:15.599
for discharge
from Bethesda Hospital.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.267
He simply left...

22:17.335 --> 22:20.537
Against the recommendations
of his own doctors.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.939
In fact,
a team of his physicians

22:23.007 --> 22:24.941
recommended months
of recuperation--

22:25.009 --> 22:29.012
months, not days.

22:29.079 --> 22:32.382
This is a man who suffered
from bleeding on the brain

22:32.449 --> 22:34.617
and was in a vegetative state.

22:34.685 --> 22:37.553
I know that President Martinez

22:37.621 --> 22:40.389
wants to do the right thing
for his country,

22:40.457 --> 22:41.857
and so do we all.

22:41.925 --> 22:45.728
But the medical evidence
is overwhelmingly clear.

22:45.796 --> 22:50.300
To take office now is not
in the best interests of anyone,

22:50.367 --> 22:52.802
especially not himself.

22:52.870 --> 22:55.638
I wish you a speedy recovery.

22:55.706 --> 23:00.076
And I promise you
that I will uphold

23:00.144 --> 23:04.214
the ideals of this office
until you return.

23:07.051 --> 23:09.686
Thank you very much.

23:20.665 --> 23:24.267
The Vice President is right.

23:24.335 --> 23:28.105
In an ideal world...

23:28.172 --> 23:30.540
I would have more time
to recover,

23:30.608 --> 23:32.442
and I wouldn't be standing here
before you,

23:32.510 --> 23:35.045
but I have no choice.

23:35.112 --> 23:38.715
I must be reinstated...

23:38.782 --> 23:42.718
to prevent a tragedy that is
unparalleled in human history,

23:42.786 --> 23:44.220
a tragedy that is born

23:44.288 --> 23:46.722
of the insecurity
and the hubris

23:46.790 --> 23:48.557
of Vice President
Raymond Jarvis--

23:48.625 --> 23:51.560
a man so deluded
and hungry for power

23:51.628 --> 23:55.097
that he would sell his soul
and the soul of this country--

23:55.164 --> 23:56.365
I think we can all agree

23:56.432 --> 23:58.466
that this is not the forum
for name-calling.

23:58.534 --> 24:00.068
Vice President Jarvis
is responsible

24:00.135 --> 24:01.369
for what happened to me.

24:01.436 --> 24:04.138
Oh, that's insane!

24:06.809 --> 24:09.244
Everyone in this room
is aware of the situation

24:09.312 --> 24:10.712
with Sophia and her people.

24:10.780 --> 24:13.081
What you don't know
is that the Vice President

24:13.149 --> 24:15.250
has been working
behind the scenes with her,

24:15.318 --> 24:18.753
helping, inadvertently or not,
to unleash a deadly virus

24:18.821 --> 24:20.922
that will decimate mankind.

24:20.990 --> 24:22.423
That's insane!
He's lying!

24:22.491 --> 24:25.826
We must act now to stop
the genocide of humanity.

24:25.894 --> 24:26.894
This is preposterous!

24:26.962 --> 24:29.263
Now, you can see
how unwell this man is.

24:29.331 --> 24:31.465
Quiet!
Everyone, quiet!

24:31.532 --> 24:35.569
I begged the Vice President
to shut down Dulles Airport

24:35.637 --> 24:37.605
and stop Sophia
from spreading the pathogen.

24:37.672 --> 24:38.906
This is delusional!

24:38.973 --> 24:40.941
And he refused,
because he was too proud...

24:41.009 --> 24:42.376
- No, this is--
- to believe the truth--

24:42.444 --> 24:43.777
that he was being manipulated
by Sophia.

24:43.845 --> 24:44.978
He is lying!

24:45.046 --> 24:47.380
I am not.

24:47.448 --> 24:49.783
And I can prove it.

24:49.850 --> 24:52.685
These are your words,
Mr. Vice President.

24:52.753 --> 24:56.055
If you do nothing,
I'll expose you to the Cabinet,

24:56.123 --> 24:59.226
tell them everything
you've done.

24:59.293 --> 25:02.062
Do you really think
the Cabinet would believe

25:02.129 --> 25:04.631
that I poisoned you
to make a deal with Sophia?

25:04.699 --> 25:08.668
You have no proof
of what I did to you

25:08.736 --> 25:10.771
or the arrangements I made
with Sophia,

25:10.838 --> 25:12.973
or you would've used it.

25:13.041 --> 25:14.207
This...

25:14.275 --> 25:16.610
This is...

25:16.677 --> 25:17.978
is doctored.

25:18.046 --> 25:20.413
This is a setup.
It is.

25:20.481 --> 25:22.182
We are running out of time.

25:22.250 --> 25:23.650
Madame Speaker...

25:23.718 --> 25:25.785
We need to vote.

25:29.901 --> 25:32.072
Shutdown Dulles.
No flights in or out.

25:32.703 --> 25:34.805
And get Armbruster
and Sterling reinstated.

25:34.873 --> 25:37.141
What about Jarvis?

25:37.208 --> 25:38.576
Who?

26:24.256 --> 26:26.290
Sophia.

26:35.100 --> 26:37.134
Sophia!

27:00.992 --> 27:02.025
Sophia!

27:04.395 --> 27:05.696
Sean!

27:05.763 --> 27:06.830
Sean!

27:06.898 --> 27:08.698
Sophia's
locked herself inside.

27:08.766 --> 27:10.834
Martinez did it--all
the flights have been canceled.

27:10.902 --> 27:12.335
Sterling said

27:12.403 --> 27:13.904
that the other two locations
have been neutralized.

27:13.971 --> 27:15.438
Sophia can still release
the virus from here.

27:15.506 --> 27:16.840
- We have to get everyone out.
- We can't.

27:16.908 --> 27:20.777
They've locked down
all the exits.

27:23.515 --> 27:26.016
Sophia, we know
what you're trying to do,

27:26.084 --> 27:27.584
but it's not going
to matter now.

27:27.652 --> 27:28.920
You're the only one left.

27:28.987 --> 27:32.523
I can see why Michael
was so fond of you.

27:32.591 --> 27:34.292
You are
remarkably resourceful.

27:34.359 --> 27:35.893
I'm sorry
it has to end this way.

27:35.961 --> 27:37.361
It doesn't have to end,
Sophia.

27:37.429 --> 27:40.465
Of course it has to end.

27:40.533 --> 27:43.635
I understand that you just
wanted to help your people,

27:43.702 --> 27:44.736
but your plan didn't work.

27:44.804 --> 27:46.572
We've secured
the other locations.

27:46.639 --> 27:48.140
The virus has been contained.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.709
If you release the virus here,

27:49.776 --> 27:53.313
all it will do is kill only
the people in this terminal.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.315
There will be no benefit
to your people.

27:55.383 --> 27:57.084
It will just be murder.

27:58.987 --> 28:00.822
They don't deserve
to die, Sophia.

28:00.889 --> 28:02.823
Did my people
deserve to die?

28:02.891 --> 28:05.258
On those buses, my son--
did my son deserve to die?

28:05.326 --> 28:06.726
No.

28:06.794 --> 28:09.596
- No, he didn't.
- No.

28:10.998 --> 28:15.335
- You don't want this.
- You don't know me.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.970
Your attention, please.

28:18.038 --> 28:21.340
Dulles International Airport
is now on lockdown.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.744
Please remain calm and stay
inside the terminal.

28:24.811 --> 28:26.646
Maybe I don't know you,

28:26.713 --> 28:28.148
but I do know
that when we first met,

28:28.215 --> 28:30.217
you weren't like this.

28:30.284 --> 28:32.286
You told me that you
and your people

28:32.354 --> 28:34.989
came here in peace.

28:35.057 --> 28:38.159
You remember that?

28:38.227 --> 28:40.028
Do you remember
telling me that?

28:40.095 --> 28:44.565
Yes, I...But things...

28:44.633 --> 28:46.633
No, things have changed.

28:46.701 --> 28:48.769
I know.
I know.

28:48.837 --> 28:51.138
Simon told me
what's happened.

28:51.206 --> 28:54.675
That you were forced
by circumstances,

28:54.742 --> 28:59.679
by--by pain.

28:59.747 --> 29:02.682
There's been enough pain,
Sophia.

29:02.750 --> 29:05.852
For everyone.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.288
Including you.

29:10.892 --> 29:12.994
You can end this, Sophia.

29:17.801 --> 29:20.102
No one else
needs to get hurt.

30:26.099 --> 30:27.299
You should know

30:27.367 --> 30:29.201
that the spread of the virus
has stopped.

30:29.269 --> 30:31.637
How?

30:31.704 --> 30:33.238
At least in part
because of someone you know.

30:33.305 --> 30:35.339
Sean Walker.

30:35.407 --> 30:37.675
Sean?

30:37.742 --> 30:39.543
Is he okay?

30:39.611 --> 30:40.911
Yes, he's all right.

30:45.918 --> 30:50.188
There's something else,
Leila.

30:50.256 --> 30:52.857
Something we found
in your labs.

31:03.704 --> 31:05.505
All right, your readings
are coming up clean.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.740
We'll let you know as soon as
we double check the tox screen.

31:07.808 --> 31:09.876
Okay, thank you.

31:12.846 --> 31:16.281
All right, Ms. Roberts.
We're ready to scan you now.

31:16.349 --> 31:18.417
Please follow me.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.322
This isn't over yet.

31:23.389 --> 31:26.458
Look, I don't know how,
but...

31:26.526 --> 31:29.127
As far as I know, Sophia's
still bringing our people here.

31:29.194 --> 31:31.496
Sean, what you need
to know is

31:31.564 --> 31:33.331
our people were here before.

31:33.398 --> 31:35.933
We were here first.

31:38.436 --> 31:40.470
I don't--
I don't understand.

31:40.538 --> 31:44.707
This place was our home
before it was yours.

31:44.775 --> 31:47.877
Why did you...leave?

31:47.945 --> 31:51.581
Because my people believe
that if we stay here

31:51.649 --> 31:53.116
something will happen

31:53.183 --> 31:55.317
to all of us.

31:55.385 --> 31:58.520
We call it <i>The Event</i>.

31:58.588 --> 32:00.255
It's a rebirth.

32:00.323 --> 32:04.093
The next step for our people.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.028
We'll change.

32:06.096 --> 32:07.730
Evolve into something else.

32:07.797 --> 32:10.733
Something greater.

32:10.801 --> 32:12.902
But your people
won't survive it.

32:12.970 --> 32:16.573
Why not?

32:16.641 --> 32:17.908
What happens?

32:17.976 --> 32:20.211
Our transportation's here.

32:20.278 --> 32:22.713
We're needed
at the White House...Now.

32:22.781 --> 32:27.284
Wait. Simon.

32:27.352 --> 32:28.785
Simon!

32:28.853 --> 32:32.355
Look, all the answers
are hidden in that scroll.

32:32.423 --> 32:34.591
About where we come from...

32:34.659 --> 32:36.826
And about how this all ends.

32:49.673 --> 32:53.443
- Blake.
- Mr. President.

32:53.510 --> 32:55.545
Ah.

32:55.613 --> 32:57.380
It is good to see you, sir.

32:57.448 --> 32:59.782
And you.

32:59.850 --> 33:02.451
And you.

33:02.519 --> 33:05.454
Agent Lee.

33:05.522 --> 33:09.057
I believe
I owe you my life.

33:11.661 --> 33:13.228
Thank you.

33:13.296 --> 33:14.663
And anything else we have
to say to each other,

33:14.731 --> 33:15.664
we'll talk about later.

33:15.732 --> 33:16.965
Yes, sir.

33:17.033 --> 33:18.367
Now, we know Sophia

33:18.435 --> 33:19.902
intends on bringing
her people here.

33:19.970 --> 33:22.638
I need to know when, how,
and if we can stop it.

33:22.706 --> 33:25.508
Sophia's still being
secured and vetted,

33:25.575 --> 33:27.377
and we can't expect her
to tell us anything.

33:27.444 --> 33:29.712
What do we know?

33:29.780 --> 33:32.716
Well, I assume the portal
that Thomas built

33:32.783 --> 33:34.818
is a part
of how she's doing it.

33:34.886 --> 33:36.386
But there were never more
than vague rumors

33:36.454 --> 33:38.021
as to where it might be.

33:38.089 --> 33:40.691
Director Sterling told me
your world is dying,

33:40.759 --> 33:42.393
and that Sophia intended
on bringing

33:42.460 --> 33:44.662
your entire population here.

33:44.729 --> 33:46.930
How many people are we
talking about?

33:46.998 --> 33:48.866
2 1/2 billion.

33:48.933 --> 33:50.867
Now that she's failed
to make room,

33:50.935 --> 33:51.902
you sure she won't
call it off?

33:51.969 --> 33:53.202
She has no choice.

33:53.270 --> 33:55.037
Our sun is close
to supernova.

33:55.105 --> 33:56.572
The planet is being
irradiated.

33:56.640 --> 33:57.806
Where does she think
she's going to put

33:57.874 --> 34:00.409
2 1/2 billion people?

34:00.476 --> 34:01.910
I don't know, sir.

34:01.978 --> 34:03.612
It doesn't seem
possible to me,

34:03.680 --> 34:05.114
but it is Sophia's plan.

34:05.182 --> 34:07.717
These rumors about
the location of the portal.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.252
How precise were they?

34:09.320 --> 34:10.754
They weren't.

34:10.822 --> 34:13.157
Most of them had the portal
located somewhere in Asia,

34:13.225 --> 34:15.592
but doesn't exactly
pin it down.

34:15.661 --> 34:17.862
- It's a start.
- It may be more than that.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.431
I was going over
the hourly logs

34:19.498 --> 34:21.433
across the departments.

34:21.500 --> 34:24.503
According to the NSA,
Jarvis personally ordered them

34:24.570 --> 34:26.204
to redirect
the surveillance satellite

34:26.272 --> 34:29.174
that covers part of Asia--
an area in Tibet.

34:29.242 --> 34:32.478
We've adjusted the satellite
back to its default position

34:32.545 --> 34:35.147
and are receiving
streaming data.

34:35.215 --> 34:36.315
What are we looking at?

34:36.382 --> 34:37.550
This is an area between

34:37.618 --> 34:39.920
the Indian subcontinent
and the Tibetan plateau.

34:39.987 --> 34:41.588
And we're picking up an area
of anomalous

34:41.656 --> 34:43.824
electromagnetic radiation
just south of the plateau.

34:43.891 --> 34:45.626
Stand by for that.

34:49.898 --> 34:53.734
What is that?

34:53.802 --> 34:55.101
That's it.

34:55.170 --> 34:56.670
The portal array.

34:56.737 --> 34:59.440
The electromagnetic
radiation.

34:59.508 --> 35:01.576
That means
it's been activated.

35:01.643 --> 35:03.744
What does that mean?

35:03.812 --> 35:05.747
It means they're coming.

35:15.865 --> 35:18.133
It was just so clean.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.702
The Chinese premier
will have it checked out,

35:20.770 --> 35:22.070
but there's no way
he'd bomb it,

35:22.138 --> 35:24.238
no matter how much
of the truth I told him.

35:24.306 --> 35:26.240
You sure there's nothing
else you can tell us?

35:26.308 --> 35:28.142
About its mechanics

35:28.209 --> 35:30.377
or anything to counteract it,
stop it?

35:30.444 --> 35:32.712
No. I'm sorry.
I wish I could.

35:36.349 --> 35:40.886
What the hell is happening?

35:40.953 --> 35:42.720
The mysterious tremors
are continuing

35:42.788 --> 35:44.956
to rattle nerves
around the globe,

35:45.024 --> 35:47.425
with Capetown and Sydney
being the latest cities

35:47.492 --> 35:49.427
to experience the shaking.

35:49.494 --> 35:51.562
These are just the latest
in an increasingly

35:51.630 --> 35:53.264
long list
of unusual happenings

35:53.332 --> 35:55.499
that have been occurring
all over the world

35:55.567 --> 35:57.501
in the past 24 hours.

35:57.569 --> 36:00.571
Sophia's a few minutes away.

36:00.639 --> 36:02.973
A yet-to-be-identified
geomagnetic phenomenon

36:03.041 --> 36:04.574
is most likely to blame.

36:11.014 --> 36:13.048
Uh, no thanks.

36:16.019 --> 36:18.053
I-I really appreciate you
waiting here with me,

36:18.121 --> 36:19.388
but you don't have to--

36:19.456 --> 36:21.291
Mr. Walker.

36:21.359 --> 36:22.826
Sorry for the delay.

36:22.893 --> 36:25.229
You've been cleared to see
Leila in the observation area.

36:25.296 --> 36:27.297
I'll take you.
Okay.

36:27.365 --> 36:29.299
Sean.

36:31.769 --> 36:34.204
Yeah?

36:34.272 --> 36:36.807
I didn't
join this fight willingly.

36:36.875 --> 36:39.577
And I know that...

36:39.644 --> 36:42.413
You forcing me to is the reason
why my family is safe.

36:42.481 --> 36:44.649
And because of you,

36:44.716 --> 36:47.585
I'm no longer ashamed
to face them.

36:47.652 --> 36:49.587
Thank you.

37:05.104 --> 37:06.238
Good-bye.

37:06.305 --> 37:08.674
Good-bye.

37:10.844 --> 37:12.912
It's right through here.

37:24.557 --> 37:26.524
Straight through there.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.526
Thanks.

37:45.841 --> 37:47.742
I know they're working
on a way to help you.

37:50.613 --> 37:53.249
They're trying.

37:53.316 --> 37:56.352
But even with all the tests,
they...

37:56.419 --> 37:57.920
They still don't know much.

37:57.988 --> 37:59.388
They'll figure it out.

37:59.456 --> 38:01.090
I know they'll find
a way to cure you.

38:05.863 --> 38:08.432
There's something...

38:08.500 --> 38:10.434
That I have to tell you.

38:10.502 --> 38:12.370
What?

38:12.437 --> 38:15.439
Something that...
They did find.

38:15.507 --> 38:19.209
What? What is it?

38:19.277 --> 38:21.944
Leila, please.

38:22.012 --> 38:25.648
I'm pregnant.

38:25.716 --> 38:29.651
What?

38:29.719 --> 38:32.087
She told me this morning,
and I...

38:32.154 --> 38:35.557
Heh.

38:35.625 --> 38:39.027
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

38:39.095 --> 38:40.863
You're--
you're gonna be okay.

38:45.469 --> 38:48.171
You're both gonna be okay.

38:57.015 --> 39:00.851
I love you.

39:00.919 --> 39:02.819
I love you so much.

39:15.164 --> 39:17.098
On TV: Jim, what we're seeing
here in New Orleans

39:17.166 --> 39:20.402
is really two disasters
hitting at the same time...

39:33.484 --> 39:38.187
We've identified
the portal array in Tibet.

39:38.255 --> 39:41.757
And we know it's bringing
your people here.

39:41.825 --> 39:45.094
I've told them...
everything I know

39:45.161 --> 39:46.962
about the portal.

39:47.030 --> 39:48.597
How do we stop it,
Sophia?

39:48.665 --> 39:51.766
How do we shut it down?

39:51.834 --> 39:53.567
You can't.

39:53.635 --> 39:55.602
Well, do you have
a predetermined landing site?

39:55.670 --> 39:57.638
You know
I won't answer that.

39:57.706 --> 40:00.541
Sophia, it's over.
You lost.

40:00.609 --> 40:02.510
We stopped you.

40:02.577 --> 40:05.213
You might find this
hard to believe,

40:05.281 --> 40:07.582
but the truth is...

40:07.650 --> 40:10.686
I ordered the spread
of the virus

40:10.754 --> 40:12.454
as an act of mercy.

40:12.522 --> 40:14.990
We will still need to make
room for our people here

40:15.058 --> 40:17.260
one way or another.

40:17.328 --> 40:22.231
However, now the only choice
open to us will be...

40:22.299 --> 40:24.199
Far from humane.

40:24.267 --> 40:25.968
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

40:26.035 --> 40:27.236
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

40:27.303 --> 40:29.037
Sorry about what?

40:29.105 --> 40:32.274
It's too late.

42:15.277 --> 42:17.811
What is it?

42:22.851 --> 42:24.919
