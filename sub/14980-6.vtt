- Some of you worked on
the joseph Hol/in case.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.784
He was the banker whose daughter
ran a Ponzi scheme
with his investors’ money.

13:15.879 --> 13:20.168
They’re suing everybody
that was involved in the failed
attempt to recover his assets.

13:20.258 --> 13:24.752
- And that includes us.
- [ Cal] 50 our lawyer’s gonna
wanna talk to you Indiw'dua/ly.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.883
Damages could run into
hundreds ofmillions,
which I don’t happen to have.

13:27.975 --> 13:31.593
So, you know, do your best
to answer the questions
as truthfully as possible.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.052
All right?

13:35.399 --> 13:38.106
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

13:44.908 --> 13:48.651
[Sighs]
You know how to lie
to the lawyer, right?

13:48.787 --> 13:51.870
What do you mean?
Don’t answer
too quickly.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.868
Short response time—
That’s a dead giveaway.

13:53.959 --> 13:57.702
And, uh, remember something
that you got wrong.
Correct yourself.

13:57.796 --> 14:02.165
Don’t look him
in the eye too much.
Include irrelevant details.

14:02.259 --> 14:07.094
Oh, and ifyou
feel nervous,
take a couple ofthese.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.588
Muscle relaxants?
Lawyer should be
pretty easy to beat.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.890
But you never know
if Lightman’s gonna
look at the tape.

14:11.977 --> 14:16.095
|— I— I cannot believe
you’re asking me
to cover for you, Loker.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.190
You’re the one who blew
the Hollin case.
You lied about it.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.025
You’re the reason
we’re being sued.
It’s notjust about me.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.946
Ifwhat I did gets out,
Lightman is in serious trouble.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.070
The investors will bankrupt him,
and they’ll turn this place into a day spa.

14:29.161 --> 14:31.618
So I shouldn’t lie to
save your ass. I should
lie to save the company.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.696
Sarcasm aside, yes.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.497
You haven’t been lying
long enough for you
to be any good at it.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.604
[Knocking]

14:59.691 --> 15:01.682
Mr. Ricks?

15:02.944 --> 15:06.027
Okay, what was Andre
doing on the roof?

15:06.114 --> 15:08.491
He goes up there
to smoke cigarettes.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.739
I don’t allow it in the house,
so he goes outside. Sometimes,
he ends up on that roof.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.161
He likes it up there
’cause you can see
the river.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.991
You’re his brother,
right?

15:20.087 --> 15:21.623
Antwon.

15:23.090 --> 15:27.333
How you doin’, Antwon?
Something you wanna tell us?

15:27.469 --> 15:29.460
No.
[Mr Ricks]
N0, the idea that...

15:29.554 --> 15:32.637
Andrejust pointed
a gun at somebody,
it’s ridiculous!

15:32.724 --> 15:35.466
/ mean, that boy never
held a gun in his life.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.051
I think Antwon would
disagree with you there.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.852
Wouldn’t you? Eh?

15:39.940 --> 15:42.022
What are you
talking about?

15:44.027 --> 15:46.143
You got something
you’re trying
not to tell us?

15:46.279 --> 15:50.522
Ifyou know something,
say it.
He had a gun.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.030
He was gettin ’ jumped
by the C ollin Terrace crew

15:54.121 --> 15:56.032
[Sighs]
He got scared.

15:56.123 --> 15:59.115
So he got a gun
to protect himself

15:59.209 --> 16:02.497
Just because Andre had a gun
doesn’t mean he pointed it
at Kuransky and Duke.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.954
Yeah, well, we can’t
dismiss the possibility.

16:06.049 --> 16:09.086
- We have to talk to Andre.
- Well, is there any chance
ofthat happening soon?

16:09.177 --> 16:11.589
Nah, he’s unconscious.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.591
Uh, how’s it goin’
with the detectives?

16:13.682 --> 16:15.968
I’ve been looking over
months of suspect interviews.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.892
Kuransky is lying everywhere.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.970
Places he’s been,
cases he’s worked.

16:21.064 --> 16:24.181
Also, his anxiety,
when he talked about
the shooting,

16:24.276 --> 16:27.234
- that wasn’t from P.T.S.D.
- [Cal] Okay

16:27.320 --> 16:30.403
There is definitely something
going on with this guy.
Ijust don’t know what it is.

16:30.490 --> 16:34.358
Well, keep digging.
I’ll be back as soon
as possible. All right?

16:34.452 --> 16:39.116
Dr. Lightman.
Special Agent Owen Finnegan
with the FBI.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.744
- We need to talk.
Please get in the car.
- Why?

16:41.835 --> 16:45.168
I’ll explain shortly.
Please get in the car.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.496
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

16:47.591 --> 16:50.879
But I am authorized to compel you
should you not choose
to accompany us voluntarily.

16:50.969 --> 16:54.757
Please get
in the car, sir.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.072
Dr. Lightman.
You were given access
to top secret material...

17:18.163 --> 17:20.119
when you were consulting
with C.|.A.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.118
So I’m gonna trust you
with some information
you shouldn’t have.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.746
Sit down.
Okay.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.667
[Finnegan]
You know
Special A gent K uransky?

17:26.755 --> 17:31.419
Ah, see, I knew there was
something wrong with you.

17:31.509 --> 17:35.627
Kuransky’s one ofse vera/
special agents undercover
in the Metro Police Department.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.509
- Why?
- We believe a small
group of terrorists...

17:38.600 --> 17:40.966
have infiltrated
law enforcement in DC.

17:41.061 --> 17:44.098
There’s a network of sleepers—
individuals linked to Al-Qaeda—
inside the police force...

17:44.189 --> 17:46.680
who are helping
to plan a str/ke.

17:46.775 --> 17:50.063
Adam Duke is a member
of this network.

17:50.153 --> 17:54.112
His real name
is Adam Ma tduka.
He ’5 Albanian by bin‘h.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.611
And as you may know,
Al Qaeda is believed
to funnel money...

17:56.701 --> 17:58.783
through groups in
Macedonia and Albania.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.111
He says he changed his name
to break with his family,
but that’s not true.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.242
He’s still in contact
with relatives back home.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.575
We est/mate three to ﬁve
sleepers like Duke
are Inside the police force.

18:06.670 --> 18:10.162
That’s why he hasn’t been
arrested yet. We want Duke
to identify the others.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.794
I’ve been partners with Duke
for 16 months.

18:12.884 --> 18:15.296
I’m inside his head.
I will get those names.

18:20.684 --> 18:24.222
- What’s your source?
- We can’t tell you that.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.768
- What’s the target?
- We can’t tell you that.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.728
[Chuckling]
But we do believe
it’ll happen soon,

18:27.816 --> 18:29.727
very soon,
ifwe don’t intervene.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.480
That’s why you gotta
back offthe Ricks case.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.186
Everyone in the department
kno ws you ’re look/n ’
at me and Duke.

18:35.282 --> 18:39.116
Ifthe other sleepers think
you’re on to who Duke
really is, they will kill him.

18:39.202 --> 18:43.036
- Then we have nothing.
- IfAndre Ricks recovers— if—

18:47.377 --> 18:50.540
And you’re telling me to
back 015‘ because of a terrorist
threat you won ’t even describe.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.586
- It’s a bit ofa joke, really.
- No, it’s not.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.791
This is real.
These people wanna inflict
major casualties on this city,

18:55.885 --> 18:59.548
and ifthat happens
because you got in the way,
that’s gonna be on your head.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.724
A/l r/ght, I’ve got
a question for you.

19:04.811 --> 19:08.804
Did Andre Ricks have a gun
in his hand...

19:08.940 --> 19:12.603
when Adam Duke shot him?
[Kuransky]
/ told you that already

19:12.694 --> 19:16.653
Yes.
That shoot was good.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.072
You see, now,
there’s the problem.

19:21.369 --> 19:25.738
You’re still lyin’.
I’ll see myselfout.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.378
You kno w,
the fact that
K uransky is undercover...

19:33.465 --> 19:36.582
could explain why
he appears to be lying
about the shooting.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.834
How?
Well, sometimes
undercover cops...

19:38.928 --> 19:41.635
can develop symptoms
of dissociation.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.964
I mean, pretending
to be somebody else
can make them anxious...

19:44.059 --> 19:47.347
and paranoid, and it can look
like they’re lying even if
they’re telling the truth.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.598
Maybe he’sjust
a bad liar.

19:49.731 --> 19:54.350
I think we should keep diggin’.
I don’t think we should be
pushing it on this one.

19:56.071 --> 19:58.027
What are you,
F.B.I. now?
No.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.196
Ifthey’re
trying to stop
a terrorist cell,

20:00.283 --> 20:02.774
then yeah,
I wanna be careful about
getting in the way.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.406
National security isjust
their favorite bogeyman.

20:05.497 --> 20:08.534
This whole
sleeper cell thing
smells fake to me.

20:08.625 --> 20:12.209
Not every threat is a lie.
You know, a plane
flew into the Pentagon.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.627
My husband was there.
I remember that day, Cal,

20:14.714 --> 20:17.547
and I would do almost
anything to prevent
that from happening again.

20:17.634 --> 20:20.592
Well, I’ll tell that
to Andre Ricks. I’m sure
he’ll feel the same way.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.881
That is not fair.
It’s not fairto him.

20:23.014 --> 20:27.428
You can’t take
the government at their word.
Unless they’re right.

20:27.519 --> 20:32.104
And ifan attack
is really being planned,
then everybody’s at risk.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.852
[ Cell Phone Ch/mes]

20:38.321 --> 20:39.310
It’s Torres.

20:39.322 --> 20:40.687
It’s Torres.

20:40.782 --> 20:43.615
A gas station In Anacostia
got robbed last year.

20:43.701 --> 20:47.068
This image was released
by Metro Police
from the security camera.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.279
- Recognize the face?
- Andre robbed a store?

20:49.374 --> 20:51.956
Yeah, I guess
he had a gun
and knew how to use it.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.622
Get that cleaned up.
Yeah.

20:57.048 --> 21:00.006
Hey, uh, paralegal’s
looking for you. The lawyer
wants to talk to you.

21:00.135 --> 21:02.501
Now?
Yeah, I guess so.

21:05.390 --> 21:09.008
[Man]
Iwill, uh,
just be a minute.

21:09.102 --> 21:11.263
Oh. I’m, uh, Wexler,
by the way.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.436
Martin Wexler.
Hi.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.730
Do you need to swear me in
before we start?

21:19.821 --> 21:23.985
No, no. This, uh—
This isn’t a formal deposition.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.066
Okay.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.945
Uh, will there be one later?

21:30.039 --> 21:34.908
Not necessarily.
Depends on what you say.
Do you have a problem with that?

21:35.003 --> 21:37.289
No. No.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.621
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.

21:39.716 --> 21:43.004
Listen.

21:43.094 --> 21:46.757
Ria, I’m just here for the facts.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.055
You give me the truth,
we ’re good

21:49.142 --> 21:53.260
Ifyou don’t, we’re not.
It’s really that simple.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.606
Do you understand?

22:00.236 --> 22:02.272
There’s no problem.

22:02.363 --> 22:05.230
Can you clean this up?
[Eli]
Yeah. Already doing it.

22:05.325 --> 22:09.284
All right, blow it up.
Can you get it?

22:09.412 --> 22:11.448
There we are.
That’s the kid
the cop shot.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.281
Yep. Yes, it is.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.752
It’s an interesting case.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.327
- Uh-huh.
- Let me know ifthere’s
anything else I can do.

22:19.422 --> 22:23.131
Well, you can talk less.
What do you see?

22:23.218 --> 22:26.460
Um... nothin’.

22:26.554 --> 22:30.718
Exactly.
No contempt, no fear.

22:30.808 --> 22:33.424
Not even pleasure.
That’s a face at rest.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.478
Doesn ’t look llke the face
of someone robbing
a store, does it?

22:36.564 --> 22:39.931
Cops Photoshopped Andre’s face
on someone else’s body?
They’re framing him?

22:40.026 --> 22:42.813
Nah, it’s not the cops.
That’s, uh—

22:42.904 --> 22:46.271
That’s done with some
very good equipment.

22:48.409 --> 22:51.116
That looks like
the FBI. to me.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.829
Cal! Good God!
Could your posture
get any worse?

23:02.924 --> 23:04.789
You’re a walking
question mark.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.795
How’s tricks
at the CIA?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.922
Less amusing since
you stopped coming by.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.800
I miss your special gift
for pissing people off.

23:13.059 --> 23:16.847
So, what’s so important
we had to meet right away?

23:16.938 --> 23:21.432
The FBI. said
there’s terrorists inside
the DC. Police Department.

23:21.526 --> 23:24.563
Is that true?

23:24.654 --> 23:26.645
Why would you wanna
ask about that?

23:26.739 --> 23:30.903
’Cause I think they’re trying
to frame a kid to shut down
an investigation.

23:30.994 --> 23:33.781
Is this the kid that
got shot by the two cops?

23:33.913 --> 23:36.495
Yeah.
Who’s trying
to frame him?

23:36.583 --> 23:38.949
Special agent by
the name of Finnegan.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.125
He falsified
some evidence.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.045
I know Finnegan.
He’s the straightest arrow
in the quiver.

23:44.132 --> 23:46.043
If somebody’s
doctoring evidence,
it isn’t him.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.716
What do you know
about these sleepers?

23:50.179 --> 23:53.091
Cal, you need to
steer clear ofthis one.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.138
You know better than
to tell me that.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.729
Why are you
so scared, Fletcher?

24:00.607 --> 24:02.939
I’ve read the intel.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.893
The threat is real.

24:05.987 --> 24:09.024
This isn’t Hussein
and his disappearing
weapons of mass destruction.

24:09.115 --> 24:12.699
This is a network
financed by people
who wanna hit us hard.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.902
Half of Langley’s
stocking up on duct tape
and plastic sheeting.

24:16.039 --> 24:18.951
What’s the target?
The theory is...

24:19.042 --> 24:21.579
they’re going after
government buildings.

24:21.669 --> 24:25.833
State Department, Supreme Court—
Who knows? Maybe the CIA.

24:25.923 --> 24:29.791
So the F.B.I.’s
telling the truth?

24:29.886 --> 24:31.968
Sleepers inside
the police department?

24:32.055 --> 24:36.264
I don’t know.
But what I do know is that
you should stay out of it.

24:36.351 --> 24:42.017
Whatever’s gonna happen to
this kid is nothing compared to
what could happen in this city.

24:42.106 --> 24:47.066
People could get hurt, Cal.
A lot of people.

24:50.239 --> 24:54.824
Just to be clear,
you didn’t like the fact that...

24:54.911 --> 24:57.197
your boss was making
a deal withJoseph Hollin.

24:57.288 --> 24:59.404
Well, I thought it was
the wrong thing to do.

24:59.499 --> 25:02.081
But that’s not my call to make.
That’s Dr. Foster’s.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.830
Right, right.
And when exactly...

25:04.921 --> 25:07.503
did you find out that
the deal had been blown up?

25:07.590 --> 25:12.084
Tuesday— Uh, no. Sorry.
Wednesday morning.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.965
I saw it online
just before I came to work.

25:15.056 --> 25:18.298
- That was the first
you heard of it?
- That’s right.

25:18.393 --> 25:22.306
Yeah. Okay.
Did you blow up the deal?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.815
No.
Did you go
to the SEC...

25:24.899 --> 25:27.106
against Dr. Foster’s wishes?

25:27.235 --> 25:29.271
No, I didn’t.
You’re a logical person.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.273
You already admitted
you didn’t want it
to happen.

25:31.364 --> 25:34.197
Yeah, and the reason
that you know that
is because Ijust told you.

25:34.283 --> 25:38.276
Pretty stupid of me
to do that if
I blew it up, isn’t it?

25:40.331 --> 25:42.663
Okay. Good.
That’s all I need.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.703
That’s it?
Yes.

25:44.794 --> 25:47.251
Thank you very much
for your time.

25:47.338 --> 25:49.454
All right.
Thank you.

25:56.556 --> 25:59.639
[Exhales Sharply]

25:59.767 --> 26:02.884
The income projections
you asked for.
Oh, yeah.

26:02.979 --> 26:05.971
And you got a call
from Corey Strong
in the mayor’s office.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.894
Said he couldn’t
reach you on your cell.
That happens all the time.

26:08.985 --> 26:10.976
[Chattering]

26:17.785 --> 26:20.993
Stay in touch.
I will. Thanks.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.828
Who’s that?
Just an acquaintance.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.205
Hi.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.124
Oh, yeah?
Where have you been?

26:31.215 --> 26:34.548
Talking to a friend
about the terrorist threat.
He says it’s real.

26:34.635 --> 26:37.012
This could get complicated.
Ijust got a call
from the hospital.

26:37.138 --> 26:40.676
Andre Ricks is conscious,
and he’s willing to talk.
All right.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.349
[Monitor Beeping]

26:43.436 --> 26:46.678
I still can’t feel anything
below my waist.

26:46.773 --> 26:51.312
Doctors keep telling me
to wiggle my toes.
Any luck?

26:53.237 --> 26:54.818
Not yet.

26:54.906 --> 26:58.148
Okay.

26:58.242 --> 27:00.619
Look, uh, I’ve gotta ask you
a couple ofquestions,
all right?

27:00.745 --> 27:02.827
Andre?
Yeah.

27:02.914 --> 27:06.156
Okay.
You own a gun, right?

27:09.796 --> 27:11.036
Yeah.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.668
All right.
Where is it?

27:16.969 --> 27:20.553
I threw it away.
It was stupid
to get it.

27:23.142 --> 27:27.385
When you went up
on the roof

27:27.480 --> 27:29.391
did you have a gun on you?

27:32.318 --> 27:34.559
No.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.815
I told you, it was gone.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.238
All I had up there
was my phone
and my cigarettes.

27:39.325 --> 27:43.238
Do you remember what happened
when you were shot?

27:44.705 --> 27:46.741
Not really.

27:48.376 --> 27:52.119
I remember people shoutin’
from far away.

27:52.213 --> 27:55.705
Then I woke up here.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.418
Did you see the lip pout
when I asked if he had a gun
on the roof?

28:02.265 --> 28:05.098
He seemed genuinely hurt
by the idea.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.345
Now, you wouldn’t see that
if he was lying, right?

28:07.436 --> 28:09.893
He could’ve denied owning
the gun altogether.
He didn’t.

28:09.981 --> 28:12.597
No, he’s telling
the truth.

28:13.901 --> 28:15.937
I don’t think he was armed
when Duke shot him.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.144
We need to call
the mayor.

28:19.615 --> 28:22.027
This kid could do
10,20 years.

28:22.118 --> 28:26.111
Yeah, but ifwe do
say something, what happens
to the FBI. investigation?

28:26.205 --> 28:29.197
That’s not our concern.
You want me
to lie to the mayor?

28:29.292 --> 28:32.750
No, but we have
to consider it, Cal.

28:32.837 --> 28:35.169
A van pulls up
in front ofa building,
and there’s an explosion.

28:35.256 --> 28:37.167
I mean, your contact
said the threat is real.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.840
There’s always gonna be
another bad guy. There’s always
gonna be another kid...

28:39.927 --> 28:41.508
they’re gonna want
to sacrifice.

28:41.596 --> 28:46.306
All right.
Ricks was unarmed.
He’s the victim here.

28:49.270 --> 28:53.434
Yeah.
Call the mayor.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.441
[Slurping]

29:07.330 --> 29:09.696
- Hey, uh, Loker.
- Hey.

29:09.832 --> 29:13.165
You know where, uh, Ria is?
She might be downstairs
gettin’ a latte.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.994
Uh-huh. Well, I got tickets
to the Wizards game,
but I gotta go to work.

29:16.130 --> 29:19.463
Can you give ’em to her?
Yeah, sure.
She deserves something nice.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.753
What you mean?
Oh, nothing.

29:21.844 --> 29:23.960
Just she’s good people.
Solid.

29:25.348 --> 29:27.839
She did it,
didn’t she?

29:27.934 --> 29:29.799
She covered for you
with that lawyer.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.473
Um, I have no idea
what you’re talking about.
I told her...

29:32.563 --> 29:36.272
not to cover for your ass,
but I guess she didn’t listen.

29:36.400 --> 29:40.018
That’s a bit harsh.
Can I talk to you
for a second?

29:43.407 --> 29:47.241
You don’t get it, do you?
Ifthis thing gets out,
you are both gonna get fired.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.364
Now, you’re Mr. Ivy League,
and you’re gonna be okay,

29:49.455 --> 29:51.366
but Ria, she’s going
back to the airport.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.743
She’s gonna be
scanning luggage and
taking it from passengers...

29:53.834 --> 29:56.120
with bad attitude all day long.

29:56.212 --> 30:00.125
She has so much more to lose
than you that it’s not even funny.

30:00.216 --> 30:02.753
But it doesn’t matter
to you, right?

30:02.843 --> 30:05.550
’Cause you think she’s
“good people.”

30:12.853 --> 30:15.811
Well, Eric
went out the door first.
I was—

30:15.898 --> 30:18.514
Uh— S or/y.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.691
No, that’s not right.

30:20.778 --> 30:24.020
I went out first.
Eric followed me.

30:24.115 --> 30:28.825
- Turn on the TV.
- Hey, I don’t see any
signs ofdeception in Duke.

30:28.911 --> 30:32.529
- Ifhe’s a spy, I mean,
how’s he hiding it?
- Turn on the TV.

30:33.666 --> 30:36.203
[Clears Throat]

30:36.293 --> 30:40.206
What we are saying is this is a cover-up,
pure and simple.

30:40.297 --> 30:43.960
Why won’t the authorities let
Kuransky and Duke face their accusers?

30:44.051 --> 30:47.714
No, that’s not right.
No, I spoke to the mayor.
Why isn’t Duke in custody?

30:47.805 --> 30:50.888
The F.B.I.’s holding him.
They won’t turn him over
to the DC. Police.

30:50.975 --> 30:53.057
National security.

30:53.144 --> 30:54.930
Uh, as soon
as the kid stepped out.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.763
[Ria]
And how far away
from Ricks were you?

30:58.899 --> 31:00.810
Maybe 10 feet.

31:04.822 --> 31:08.064
- What?
- They’re not gonna get anything
out of Duke.

31:08.159 --> 31:09.740
Why?

31:10.911 --> 31:12.947
You said...

31:13.039 --> 31:15.405
Kuransky was suffering
from dissociation...

31:15.499 --> 31:17.831
because of being
undercover, right?

31:17.918 --> 31:19.954
Yeah, yeah.
Being undercover is hard to take.

31:20.046 --> 31:22.287
All right.
Was it a problem for Duke?

31:22.423 --> 31:24.584
No, not at all.
Well, ifhe ’s a terrorist,

31:24.675 --> 31:26.961
he’s been undercover
longer than Kuransky.

31:27.053 --> 31:30.136
So his symptoms
should be worse.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.884
Maybe they got it wrong.
You know, maybe
he’s not a terrorist.

31:32.975 --> 31:35.808
I mean, that would explain
why he didn’t show
any signs ofdeception.

31:35.895 --> 31:37.931
He wouldn’t
have been lying.

31:40.316 --> 31:42.557
I’ve looked at over
a dozen interrogations,

31:42.651 --> 31:44.858
and there’s no sign
ofdeception in Duke.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.197
Here it is.
This is the one
I’ve been looking for.

31:47.281 --> 31:49.772
It’s Duke questioning
a neo-Nazi.

31:51.535 --> 31:54.026
/ think this country
is a whore bitch.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.407
Dechristianized,
mongrelized,
Obama-nized.

31:56.499 --> 31:58.911
The streets are sewers
filled with human trash.

31:59.001 --> 32:01.913
The cities reek
with moral decay—

32:02.004 --> 32:03.540
Look at Duke.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.462
See that
con tempt smile ?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.297
He’s offended.
Yeah, ifhe were
a terrorist...

32:07.384 --> 32:09.124
obsessed with
attacking America,
he wouldn’t hate this guy.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.923
He’d agree with him.
Well, maybe he’s not
a sleeper.

32:12.014 --> 32:14.300
The FBI. have been
investigating Duke
for over a year.

32:14.391 --> 32:17.554
How could they
get it so wrong?

32:17.645 --> 32:20.853
Haven’t you done enough?
You already destroyed
an undercover operation...

32:20.940 --> 32:22.805
we spent years
putting in place.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.603
It put the wrong man
in custody.
Why?

32:24.693 --> 32:26.604
Because Duke doesn’t have
a personality disorder?

32:26.695 --> 32:29.778
Because he looked irritated when
some skinhead yelled at him?
Gimme a break.

32:29.865 --> 32:32.072
Well, you’ve been
interrogating Duke.
What have you got?

32:32.159 --> 32:34.650
Well, you’ve been
on him for hours.
You got nothing, r/ght?

32:34.745 --> 32:38.829
You’re startin’ to worry, startin’ to think
you might have screwed up.

32:38.916 --> 32:41.908
I can see it in your face.
You can’t afford to make
a mistake here.

32:44.046 --> 32:46.788
Damn it.

32:46.924 --> 32:50.212
How’d we get it wrong
about Duke?
You may have had some help.

32:50.302 --> 32:54.045
A Photoshop picture
of Andre Ricks
was given to the police.

32:54.140 --> 32:57.507
- I don’t know
anything about that.
- I believe you.

here than Duke.

gone rogue.

Hey. Uh, sorry
about the wait.

33:31.844 --> 33:34.506
What am I doing here?
Finnegan just said show up.
What is this?

33:34.638 --> 33:36.594
Yeah,
I want to talk.
Yeah, about what?

33:36.682 --> 33:41.096
Sit down.
About spies.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.098
See, there’s two kinds
ofspies, right?

33:43.189 --> 33:45.555
There’s spies that
gather good information,

33:45.649 --> 33:50.894
and then there’s spies
that spread bad information.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.199
Yeah. I think you’re
one of the latter.

33:54.283 --> 33:55.819
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you saying?

33:55.910 --> 33:58.367
Well, you said that
Adam Duke was a terrorist.

33:58.454 --> 34:01.571
In fact, the whole case against him
is based on what you’ve said.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.039
He is a terrorist.
No, he’s not.

34:04.126 --> 34:06.412
Which means that you’re either
incredibly stupid,

34:06.503 --> 34:09.495
or you’re giving
bad information to the FBI.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.421
You accusing me ofworking
for the other side?

34:11.508 --> 34:14.090
You saying I’m Al-Qaeda?
I got a picture of Osama
in my wallet?

34:14.220 --> 34:16.632
I didn’t say that.
What the hell
are you saying then?

34:16.722 --> 34:19.304
See, that’s good.
You’re pretty good.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.302
I’m not seeing any fear.
I’m only seeing anger.

34:21.435 --> 34:24.347
Huh.
I mean, the photograph though
that you sent to the police...

34:24.438 --> 34:27.225
of Andre—

34:27.316 --> 34:31.025
That was crude.
That showed desperation.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.527
Look. You think
I’ve been bought off,
you check my bank account.

34:34.657 --> 34:36.238
I got nothin’.
That’s true.

34:36.325 --> 34:39.943
But you did
have something.

34:40.037 --> 34:42.824
Didn’t you?
You used to have something.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.250
You had...

34:48.337 --> 34:50.373
a daughter.

34:51.882 --> 34:54.294
Specialist
Jacqueline Kuransky.

34:54.385 --> 34:56.842
To hell with this.
I’m not doing this.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.636
Hey, not until your boss
tells you to.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.714
Sit down.

35:21.537 --> 35:25.405
On October 14, 2005,
Specialist
Jacqueline Kuransky...

35:25.499 --> 35:30.163
was killed by enemy fire
while on patrol in Tikrit.
Well, that’s not true, is it?

35:30.254 --> 35:32.745
She was killed
by friendly fire.

35:32.840 --> 35:36.207
We have the file.

35:36.302 --> 35:40.887
But you—
Not that they’d admit it.
I mean, what’s their line?

35:40.973 --> 35:43.055
“Under investigation.”

35:45.019 --> 35:47.135
Now, you’re getting angrier.
That’s good.

35:47.229 --> 35:51.063
I can understand that. I mean,
if somebody did this to my kid,
I’d wanna tear their head off.

35:53.736 --> 35:56.318
- She deserves the truth.
- Yes, she does.

35:56.405 --> 35:59.989
She died wearing her uniform.
She deserves the truth.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.157
[Cal]
Yes, she does.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.996
You wanna get back
at the people you think
k/l/ed your daughter.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.745
Now, I understand that.
That is... basic.

36:13.088 --> 36:14.919
They lied.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.586
And they lied
about everything.

36:20.596 --> 36:22.712
They lied about
how long she would be there,

36:22.806 --> 36:27.266
what she would do,
what kind of armor
her truck would ha ve.

36:28.771 --> 36:32.104
They even lied about
how she died.

36:37.988 --> 36:41.606
[Chuckles]
All they did was tell lies.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.693
Well—

36:46.747 --> 36:49.284
[Sniffles]
I can lie too.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.791
There you go.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.167
K uransky ga ve us
four more sleepers.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.843
Were they police?
No.

37:03.931 --> 37:06.013
They were E.M.T.’s.
Paramedics.

37:06.100 --> 37:08.933
- Why them?
- It was planned
as a double attack.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.884
An initial explosion
to produce casualties.

37:10.979 --> 37:14.312
And the ambulances
would arrive
driven by sleepers...

37:14.400 --> 37:16.311
and stuffed with
more explosives.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.563
We would’ve waved
those ambulances right in
without thinking twice,

37:18.654 --> 37:22.772
because Kuransky
had us convinced that
the terrorists were police.

37:22.866 --> 37:26.450
He told the FBI.
that I was a terrorist?

37:26.537 --> 37:29.279
What does this have
to do with the shooting?

37:29.373 --> 37:32.865
Well, Kuransky’s story
depended on you being
on the police force.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.372
And when you shot Andre Ricks,
he knew you could get arrested.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.373
So he had to make
the shooting lookjustified.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.375
Hey, that shoot
was good.

37:39.466 --> 37:42.503
No, it wasn’t.
When Kuransky got down
to the street,

37:42.594 --> 37:44.459
he saw Andre wasn’t armed,
so he put a gun on him.

37:44.555 --> 37:47.638
He had a gun on the roof.
I was there. I saw it.

37:47.724 --> 37:51.057
No, what you saw was this.
His cell phone.

38:03.407 --> 38:08.322
You saw a gun because
you believed he had one.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.368
It-lt wasn’t there.

38:11.748 --> 38:14.831
[ K uransky ]
Put your hands
where we can see ’em!

38:14.918 --> 38:16.249
Hold it!

38:19.423 --> 38:22.290
Listen to me, Detective.
Before you say anything,
you talk to a lawyer.

38:22.384 --> 38:24.875
[Exhales Sharply]

38:28.140 --> 38:30.381
How’s the kid?

38:30.476 --> 38:32.808
The doctors say there’s
no lasting damage
to his spinal cord.

38:32.895 --> 38:35.932
So he should
recover.

38:36.023 --> 38:38.639
Tell him, uh—

38:41.445 --> 38:43.481
Tell him I’m sorry.

39:11.183 --> 39:13.094
[Sighs]

39:19.650 --> 39:21.606
Quick, in my office.

39:32.079 --> 39:36.994
Before you say anything,
it was me.
I blew up the deal.

39:37.084 --> 39:39.370
I-I went to the SEC.

39:39.461 --> 39:44.125
I lied to Foster about it.
I still think it was
the right thing to do.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.423
But no one else was involved.
It wasjust me.

39:46.510 --> 39:48.296
I knew that.

39:48.428 --> 39:50.259
You did?
Yeah.

39:50.389 --> 39:53.381
Yeah, I’ve known that
all along.
Why didn’t you say anything?

39:53.475 --> 39:56.308
- ’Cause I decided to run a test.
- What kind of test?

39:59.022 --> 40:00.933
The lawsuit.
That was a test.

40:01.024 --> 40:04.312
You lied to everyone in the office
so you could treat me like a lab rat?

40:04.403 --> 40:07.645
No. No, I was
testing Torres.

40:07.781 --> 40:10.523
Why?
’Cause I could tell
she knew what you’d done.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.528
I mean, there was
no surprise there.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.826
But we have a lot
of secrets here.
So I wanted to see...

40:14.913 --> 40:16.778
Ifshe could keep one
under pressure.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.031
Are you gonna fire her
for not turning me in?
No. /’d ﬁre her ifshe had

40:19.126 --> 40:21.458
Loyalty’s crucial here.

40:21.545 --> 40:25.959
But you, on the other hand,
what you did is inexcusable.

40:26.049 --> 40:28.426
And in vo/vmg her
is selﬁsh,

40:28.510 --> 40:31.627
disrespectful,
andjust plain stupid.

40:31.722 --> 40:33.929
I’ll empty my office.

40:34.016 --> 40:36.507
No, you can stay.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.722
You can stay.
But...

40:39.813 --> 40:44.227
from now, you ’ll be pa/d
what you ’re worth, which is nothing.

40:44.318 --> 40:47.185
You’re an unpaid intern.

40:47.279 --> 40:49.645
It’s that,
or you can leave.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.871
So what’s he gonna do?
I don’t know.

40:59.958 --> 41:03.075
Didn’t hang around
to find out.

41:06.089 --> 41:10.128
Lokenn
isn’t the only one
who lied.

41:10.218 --> 41:12.504
Oh,yeah?

41:13.889 --> 41:19.009
That woman
who came in yesterday—
That’s Alec’s sponsor.

41:19.102 --> 41:21.263
He had a problem
with cocaine...

41:21.355 --> 41:23.266
before we were married.

41:23.357 --> 41:26.474
But he’s been
in recovery since.

41:26.568 --> 41:29.651
A couple of months ago,
he started using again.

41:29.738 --> 41:32.571
And he’sjust
trying to stay clean.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.614
How’s he doing?

41:34.701 --> 41:38.364
Some days are good,
some... not so good.

41:38.455 --> 41:40.787
Well, ifthere’s
anything I can do—

41:43.502 --> 41:48.792
You didn’tjust happen
to find Alec’s glasses
the other night, did you?

41:48.882 --> 41:50.793
You thought he was
having an affair.

41:50.884 --> 41:53.967
No, I was afraid
you were gonna get hurt.

41:58.767 --> 42:02.100
- You were protecting me?
- Something like that, yeah.

42:04.648 --> 42:07.640
You know...

42:07.734 --> 42:11.352
the line we talk about?

42:11.446 --> 42:16.566
You know, the line
we have to draw because
we see things people are hiding.

42:16.660 --> 42:20.073
Things they don’t want us to know.

42:22.124 --> 42:26.083
I think we should respect the line.

42:26.169 --> 42:28.330
I think it’s best for both of us.
