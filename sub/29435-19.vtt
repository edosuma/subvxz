WEBVTT

00:03.916 --> 00:05.266
It's very good.

00:06.963 --> 00:09.357
Let's hear the last partone more time, though.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.750
Geez, Max, it ain't
rocket science.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.013
Humor me.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.450
Again. Bobby?

00:15.493 --> 00:18.931
I cut the alarm wires over here.

00:18.975 --> 00:21.064
And I tie up the old man
right there.

00:21.108 --> 00:24.894
We break the glass case, bag thegoods, and we're out the door.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.461
Bag the goods.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.376
Yeah, that's one
way of putting it.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.552
Eh, better you guys
than me, huh?

00:30.595 --> 00:32.032
And once we're out?

00:32.075 --> 00:35.731
Once you're out,
I drive us all to the airport

00:35.774 --> 00:37.689
and then it's Argentina,here we come.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.387
First round of
margaritas is on me.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.432
Man, margaritas are in Mexico.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.173
Oh, no, Argentina, too.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.915
My wife says it's exactly
like living here.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.483
You told your wife about this?

00:48.526 --> 00:49.788
Not much.

00:49.832 --> 00:51.877
I mean, besides,
who's she gonna tell?

00:51.921 --> 00:53.488
[chuckles]
Don't worry about it.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.359
Fine.

00:55.403 --> 00:57.622
Any last questions?

00:57.666 --> 00:59.711
The plane tickets--you hanging on to those?

00:59.755 --> 01:01.496
Until we get
to the airport, yeah.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.759
Yeah, well, you mind
if I get mine now?

01:03.802 --> 01:06.109
You know, just in case
something goes wrong.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.850
[chuckles]

01:07.893 --> 01:09.286
I can assure you, Danny,

01:09.330 --> 01:11.767
that nothing
is going to go wrong.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.291
Especially now that
you've been demoted.

01:14.335 --> 01:17.207
Wait, what?Lenny, you're
the driver now, too.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.473
Um, sure, Max,
I can drive, but...

01:22.517 --> 01:24.475
Okay, but if Lenny'll drive,
what'll I do?

01:28.479 --> 01:30.046
You can learn[groaning]

01:30.090 --> 01:32.222
to keep your damn mouth shut.

01:42.841 --> 01:45.540
[gunshots]

01:48.673 --> 01:50.501
Hey, I don't need my ticket yet.

01:50.545 --> 01:53.548
At least now
it's a three-way split.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.511
Dump him.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.600
Someplace far.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.994
We meet at the
usual place.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.996
8:00 a.m.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.041
â™ª

02:37.505 --> 02:40.203
Come on, guys, just a little
post-work celebration.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.770
We've done it before.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.989
Well, not today, we haven't.Yeah, that's my point.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.904
Not on Saint Patrick's Day,
of all the days.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.907
Y'all know that I,
uh, don't do Saint Pat's.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.735
Uh, yeah, you do.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.302
You're wearing green.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.870
Yeah, enough green to keep
the crazy Irish people

02:54.913 --> 02:57.655
like you from saying,
"You're not wearing green."

02:57.699 --> 02:59.701
Who is so crazy?
And I'll have you know,

02:59.744 --> 03:02.007
I am only one-quarter Irish.

03:02.051 --> 03:04.401
And I'm four-quarters not Irish

03:04.445 --> 03:05.924
at all.Well, I am half-Irish,

03:05.968 --> 03:08.100
but that half plans

03:08.144 --> 03:12.017
on enjoying corned beef andcabbage at home with my family,

03:12.061 --> 03:14.585
and not with a bunch of randomdrunks throwing up on my shoes.

03:14.629 --> 03:15.934
That sums it up
right there, McGee.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.240
Saint Pat's

03:17.284 --> 03:19.068
is amateur night.Not for everybody.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.766
Especially not for the countlessmembers of law enforcement,

03:21.810 --> 03:24.116
who happily celebrate
together once a year.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.249
You don't remember last year?

03:26.293 --> 03:28.860
We were slammed
with random drunks.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.949
Proving once again
that green beer and sailors

03:30.993 --> 03:32.864
on shore leave
are a bad combination.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.389
So's a dead body
at a Navy recruiting office.

03:35.432 --> 03:37.434
Hey, Gibbs, where's your green?

03:37.478 --> 03:39.654
GIBBS:In my wallet. Let's go.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.792
Long time, Kerrigan.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.141
The great Gibbs.

03:49.185 --> 03:50.621
Oh, top of the morning.

03:50.665 --> 03:51.970
How you doing?

03:52.014 --> 03:53.755
Depends what we're looking at.Uh...

03:53.798 --> 03:55.060
male, mid-20s,

03:55.104 --> 03:56.758
four gunshot
wounds and...

03:56.801 --> 03:58.150
Did you say "we"?

03:58.194 --> 03:59.543
Navy recruiting center.

03:59.587 --> 04:00.762
It's their dumpster.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.851
Called NCIS insteadof talking to me.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.461
Nice protocol.

04:04.505 --> 04:05.680
You want to argue jurisdiction?

04:05.723 --> 04:07.725
Oh, no, no, no,hell no, not today.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.510
Yeah, it's all yours.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.686
Hey, uh, Donnelly?

04:11.729 --> 04:14.341
Send NCIS everythingwe've, uh, collected so far.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.518
Though it's not much.

04:17.561 --> 04:20.347
No shell casings,no signs of a struggle.

04:21.565 --> 04:22.827
And no body.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.047
Huh?

04:26.744 --> 04:30.487
Oh, man, where's our M.E.?

04:30.531 --> 04:32.184
I wondered where his truck went.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.099
Your guy took the body already?

04:34.143 --> 04:36.493
Damn it, fellas, I told you guysto work fast, but not too fast.

04:36.537 --> 04:37.712
What's the rush?

04:37.755 --> 04:39.104
The parade.

04:39.148 --> 04:41.846
Yeah, we're all marching later.We are?

04:41.890 --> 04:44.545
No, weare, MPD.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.024
We do it every year.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.113
Tip a few afterward.
It's a blast.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.507
You should try it.Yeah. Yeah, we should.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.553
Yeah.JIMMY: Hey, guys.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.032
Sorry I'm late.

04:54.076 --> 04:55.382
Never should have
taken the Beltway.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.775
That pre-parade traffic
is nuts already.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.516
You didn't missed
anything, Jimmy.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.692
Call said there's
a body in a dumpster. What...

05:01.736 --> 05:03.999
Yeah, yeah, I'm having our M.E.send it right over.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.394
Ah, it's his voice mail,
but, uh,

05:07.437 --> 05:09.134
you'll have the body soon.How soon?

05:09.178 --> 05:11.354
An hour, maybe... two.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.703
Thatsoon?

05:12.747 --> 05:14.401
What do you want?
It's a holiday.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.663
[chuckles]

05:15.706 --> 05:17.012
See ya.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.709
Let's get to the parade, guys.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.798
I skipped breakfast for this?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.496
Pick something up on
the way back to the lab.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.454
Traffic permitting. I...[phone dings]

05:26.326 --> 05:27.979
See you guys soon.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.677
TORRES:
All right, Jimmy.

05:29.720 --> 05:33.376
Boss, here's everything
MPD's collected so far.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.073
Including a fingerprint ID.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.119
It's a start.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.688
[indistinct chatter]

05:42.429 --> 05:45.083
Okay, one Kasie special.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.085
Green bagel and a coffee to go.

05:47.129 --> 05:48.522
My special's green now?

05:48.565 --> 05:50.306
Most everythingis today, darling.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.525
Ah.You okay?

05:51.568 --> 05:53.353
Yeah.
Just, uh, new contacts.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.355
The better to see
my special bagel with.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.139
How about some special pancakes?

05:57.182 --> 05:58.445
Jimmy, hey.

05:58.488 --> 05:59.924
Thought you had
a call this morning.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.578
I did, but a mix-up
with the body

06:01.622 --> 06:03.580
means that what I have now
is an hour to kill.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.060
Care to kill
it with me?

06:05.103 --> 06:06.757
That, or we could just
have breakfast together.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.280
Counter or booth?

06:08.324 --> 06:10.413
Is that booth
spoken for, Elaine?

06:10.457 --> 06:12.763
It is now. Just let Shaynewipe it down real quick.

06:12.807 --> 06:13.808
Great.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.462
So...

06:15.505 --> 06:17.725
you seem a little extra chipperthis morning.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.075
I am chipper by choice
today, Kasie.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.773
I woke up in the worst mood
for no apparent reason and I

06:22.817 --> 06:25.341
hit morning traffic, which, of
course, didn't help, but then,

06:25.385 --> 06:28.126
uh, I don't know, after
a crime scene with no body,

06:28.170 --> 06:31.782
and, uh, followed by smooth
sailing on the ride home,

06:31.826 --> 06:34.829
I guess I just decidedI would feel better.

06:34.872 --> 06:36.352
As only you can.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.615
And nothing is gonna
bring me down. Oh...

06:38.659 --> 06:40.617
Hey, easy, man.
What the hell?

06:40.661 --> 06:42.010
Oh gosh, s-sorry.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.404
Yeah, you are.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.189
[clears throat]

06:50.061 --> 06:51.367
What was that about?
You okay?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.803
What?
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, it's...

06:52.847 --> 06:54.631
I just bumped
into them by accident.

06:54.675 --> 06:55.806
Yeah, and accidents happen.

06:55.850 --> 06:56.938
They could have been
nicer about it.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.722
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.464
Care to split an appetizer?

07:01.508 --> 07:03.553
Absolutely.And nothing's

07:03.597 --> 07:05.816
gonna bring us down.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.514
[chuckles]

07:14.956 --> 07:17.088
I mean, I'm not
saying I'd march, but

07:17.132 --> 07:18.829
they could have
at least invited us.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.091
BISHOP:
This coming from the man

07:20.135 --> 07:22.137
who doesn't doSaint Patrick's Day.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.965
TORRES:
Yeah. I do parades, though.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.445
We got anythingon this guy yet?

07:25.488 --> 07:26.924
Yeah.

07:26.968 --> 07:30.275
Victim is Daniel Spagnolo,
29, unemployed,

07:30.319 --> 07:32.930
recently released from
Augusta Correctional Center.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.498
He served 18 months for burglaryand aggravated assault.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.804
His body here yet?

07:36.847 --> 07:38.240
MPD said about an hour or two,

07:38.283 --> 07:39.720
so I'll call and check again.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.112
Next of kin?

07:41.156 --> 07:42.723
We're stillworking on that, too.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.376
Work fast. I heard Torres

07:44.420 --> 07:45.987
has got a parade to get to.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.252
Ever since I was kid,that's how I've always dealt

07:50.295 --> 07:53.211
with dark days, you know,bad moods. Conflicts, even.

07:53.255 --> 07:56.476
By swallowing your feelings?By transforming 'em.

07:56.519 --> 07:59.261
My mom always used to say,"If you can fake happiness,

07:59.304 --> 08:00.697
you can eventuallyfeel happiness."

08:00.741 --> 08:02.438
Yeah, see, I could maybe do that

08:02.482 --> 08:04.658
for an awkward Thanksgiving
dinner, but long term,

08:04.701 --> 08:06.398
I have to let some
pressure off the valve.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.748
Otherwise I'll explode.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.271
Oh, yeah, same here.
I mean,

08:09.314 --> 08:10.925
everyone has that line
that can't be crossed.

08:10.968 --> 08:14.755
My line is just a...Just a lot farther away

08:14.798 --> 08:16.931
than everyone else's.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.715
And until someone
crosses it, I mean,

08:18.759 --> 08:21.109
it's just a lot easier
to be nice, isn't it?

08:21.152 --> 08:22.719
Did someone say "nice"?

08:22.763 --> 08:25.940
Verynice, and not
at all green.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.942
[laughs]
Bagels I have no control over.

08:27.985 --> 08:30.118
Pancakes, I do.
You need refills?

08:30.161 --> 08:31.772
When you have a chance, please.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.338
And where the hell's our check?

08:35.950 --> 08:38.039
I didn't know you were ready.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.519
Then try paying attention.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.739
[quietly]:
Speaking of crossing a line.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.611
That definitely crosses mine.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.134
Nothing worse than a bully.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.049
Oh, except maybe a rude bully.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.833
Let's go, lady,
while we're young.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.488
Maybe if you
ask nicely.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.583
Are you talking to us?

09:00.627 --> 09:02.629
Well, it's just so unnecessary

09:02.672 --> 09:04.239
to speak to people that way.

09:04.282 --> 09:07.590
And, uh, what way is that?

09:07.634 --> 09:09.723
You know the old saying about...

09:09.766 --> 09:11.594
catching more flies with honey?

09:11.638 --> 09:14.292
No, we don't know that saying.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.340
And how about you?

09:18.383 --> 09:20.342
Do you know it?

09:20.385 --> 09:23.084
Look, you guys,
everyone here is just

09:23.127 --> 09:25.086
trying to enjoy
their breakfast, okay?

09:25.129 --> 09:26.870
Oh, so now you speak
for everyone?

09:26.914 --> 09:29.177
Here you go.
Sorry for the wait.

09:29.220 --> 09:33.050
[sighs]Hey.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.400
We have better things to do.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.144
Your lucky day.

09:44.888 --> 09:48.805
Luck of the Irish.
Hmm.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.767
Sorry, Jimmy, I just...
I couldn't...

09:53.810 --> 09:55.899
No, don't apologize.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.640
You were right to say something.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.772
Those guys needed to hear that.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.034
[applause]MAN: Yeah.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.253
Good job.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.083
And weneeded some of this.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.303
Thank you. Thank you.

10:08.346 --> 10:09.957
Oh, my gosh, it was
nothing, really.

10:11.785 --> 10:14.265
So the cops took our bodyand we're still waiting for it.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.746
For all we know,
it's on the M.E.'s float

10:16.790 --> 10:18.748
in their parade.It's been about an hour.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.402
Hour and a half.SLOANE:
Can't say I'm surprised.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.578
I had this old bartending buddywho used to say that

10:22.622 --> 10:24.972
the best time to commit a crimeis on St. Paddy's Day,

10:25.015 --> 10:27.888
when all the cops are out havingway too much fun to notice.

10:27.931 --> 10:30.151
All right, got
a next of kin.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.936
Victim's last known
address is a rental,

10:32.980 --> 10:35.156
listed under the nameMelissa Spagnolo.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.898
Could be a wife or sister.Go, find out.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.464
Well, it's near
the parade route.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.466
Anyone, uh, care to sit
in traffic with me?

10:41.510 --> 10:43.338
Sorry.
I... I have a thing.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.645
And we got a body.Thanks.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.298
MPD said they just
delivered it now.

10:47.342 --> 10:48.996
I will make sure Jimmy knows.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.475
And I'll make surewith you.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.653
Don't be long.

10:56.481 --> 10:57.961
JIMMY:
Oh, it's so good.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.833
Save room for these beauties.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.704
Elaine, no,
we're stuffed.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.010
Then I'll wrap 'em to go.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.751
It's just a little thank you.

11:04.794 --> 11:07.492
Those creeps have been taking upa booth every morning for weeks.

11:07.536 --> 11:08.885
There's usually
four of 'em.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.321
They're always rude

11:10.365 --> 11:11.714
and demanding countless refills

11:11.758 --> 11:13.455
and don't even tip.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.892
Ooh, no, that last one
sealed it for me.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.241
I'll just be glad
that they are gone

11:17.285 --> 11:18.547
and hope
they never come back, huh?

11:18.590 --> 11:19.940
Oh, they're not gone.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.245
They've been
in that jewelry shop

11:21.289 --> 11:22.551
for at least 20 minutes or so.

11:22.594 --> 11:23.770
Any chance they work there?

11:23.813 --> 11:25.902
No, I can't imagine
old Mr. Mantell

11:25.946 --> 11:27.599
would hire a bunch of guys
like that.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.471
Hmm. Oh, wait.
Here they come.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.516
ELAINE:
Or at least one of 'em.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.170
Was he wearing a cap
when he went in?

11:33.214 --> 11:34.781
ELAINE:
Not that I've noticed.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.437
Yes, I'm serious.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.178
We're finishing up here soon.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.614
I'm down if you're down.

11:42.658 --> 11:45.443
Saint Paddy's parade,here we come.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.532
Hey, Jimmy, where are you?

11:47.576 --> 11:49.534
Jimmy?

11:49.578 --> 11:50.927
Where is he?

11:50.971 --> 11:52.755
Jimmy?

11:55.976 --> 11:57.238
This looks like our guy.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.155
Ooh. Yeah, clear
cause of death.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.985
Yo, Jimbo?

12:05.028 --> 12:06.856
Where'd you be, son?

12:06.900 --> 12:10.730
Hmm. Maybe he's
in Kasie's lab.

12:10.773 --> 12:13.515
All right.Let's see what's up.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.528
Okay, this-this
doesn't feel right.

12:26.571 --> 12:27.877
Doesn't look right, either.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.400
Maybe give the police
a preemptive call,

12:29.444 --> 12:31.054
just in case.Okay.

12:31.098 --> 12:33.491
Good idea.
I'm gonna call Gibbs.

12:33.535 --> 12:34.710
Oh, and I'll call McGee.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.494
Oh, look at that.
Got a text from Nick.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.844
Ooh. A call from Bishop.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.339
You can still get out.Let everyone go. Guys.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.863
You're supposed...

14:23.906 --> 14:25.429
Oh!

14:25.473 --> 14:27.997
Everybody just
shut the hell up.

14:31.827 --> 14:33.350
Nobody is going anywhere.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.135
You got it?

14:39.226 --> 14:41.445
BISHOP:
We can't find them.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.534
They're not in Kasie's lab,no answer on their cells.

Reports are coming in

14:55.720 --> 14:57.722

Oh, I'm bleeding here, Max.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.612
You want to bleed more?

May I call you Max?

16:20.849 --> 16:22.807
You're only burying yourself
deeper here.

16:22.851 --> 16:25.506
The only thing getting buried
is you two

16:44.873 --> 16:46.440
Who is it?

16:46.483 --> 16:47.789
Someone who can help.

16:47.832 --> 16:50.096
Yeah, right.
You or me?

16:50.139 --> 16:52.098
Hang up.

Wait. No, don't hang up.
Don't...Hey, sit... down.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.103
Okay. All right, guys,

16:57.146 --> 16:58.713

we think it is,

16:58.756 --> 17:00.236
he can help us.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.893
Okay.
Okay, answer it.

Go.

Do not get cute.

17:19.429 --> 17:20.735
Gibbs?

17:20.778 --> 17:22.215
You and Kasie okay?

17:27.220 --> 17:28.873
For now, yeah.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.440
How many are there?

17:31.746 --> 17:33.356
Can't say.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.967
Can't, meaningthey're listening?

17:39.232 --> 17:41.364
There's five of us and threeof them. One of them's injured.

17:41.408 --> 17:44.063
The other two... Uh...

17:46.239 --> 17:48.415
Palmer, are you there?
Jimmy?

17:51.940 --> 17:53.507
So you're a cop?

17:53.550 --> 17:55.683
I am a medical examiner.

17:55.726 --> 17:58.773
The man you just hung up onis a federal agent-slash-

You...I need to think.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.872
Go!

18:10.915 --> 18:13.004
I need to think.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.616
What do we know so far?Robbers hit that shop.

18:15.659 --> 18:18.445
Armored truck arrived,
bang-bang. Getaway car

18:18.488 --> 18:20.534
crashed there,and they ran to the diner.

18:20.577 --> 18:21.970
We don't know how
many are in there yet.

18:22.013 --> 18:23.624
Eight.Three shooters,

18:23.667 --> 18:26.192
five hostages.How do you know that?

18:26.235 --> 18:27.584
We've learned to stop asking.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.369
Jewelry store, let's go.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.024
Are you talking to them now?

18:33.068 --> 18:35.288
Was.
Trying to get 'em back.

18:35.331 --> 18:38.943
Listen, Gibbs, your reputation
precedes you, but I think

18:38.987 --> 18:41.424
it's far too early to becalling them hostages just yet.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.122
I don't care what we call 'em.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.211
Just want to get 'em out alive.

18:46.690 --> 18:47.909
Officer.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.954
Come on,Palmer, pick up.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.043
Heyo.

18:52.087 --> 18:54.176
They weren't expecting us.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.873
I know for sure
I hit one of 'em.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.092
Where's the owner?

18:57.136 --> 18:58.485
We haven't seen him.

18:58.528 --> 18:59.573
Name's Mantell.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.406
Mr. Mantell?

19:06.449 --> 19:07.624
Door's locked.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.413
[muffled grunting]

19:13.456 --> 19:14.936
We got him.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.419
Oh!Hey.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.116
Thank you. Thank you.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.423
Ah, thank you.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.903
And thank God.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.776
Oh, all I could hear
was-was glass breaking

19:28.819 --> 19:30.604
and then all
the shooting, and...

19:30.647 --> 19:32.127
BISHOP:All right, all right,Mr. Mantell, slow down.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.347
Oh, look at this place.

19:34.390 --> 19:37.132
Oh, my God. What a mess.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.048
You guys okay?Yeah.

19:40.091 --> 19:43.617
Ah. I should have moved
that stuff out sooner.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.576
What stuff?These guys were
picking up diamonds

19:46.620 --> 19:47.969
I had on display.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.536
Real beauties.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.364
They left a lot
of jewelry behind.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.975
Well, that's peanuts
compared to my diamonds.

19:54.018 --> 19:56.804
I tempted fate for too longkeeping them here.

19:58.675 --> 20:01.069
Hey, Nick?

20:01.112 --> 20:03.114
What do you
make of this?

20:06.030 --> 20:07.858
TORRES:Condom rapper.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.951
I mean, for weeks,
we scouted that place.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.476
No armored truck. Not once.I know.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.479
I still say we could've made it
if Lenny knew how to drive.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.481
I was only supposed
to be the lookout, okay?

20:21.524 --> 20:24.527
If Max hadn't killed Danny
we'd be at the airport by now.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.014
Danny had a big mouth.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.929
Like you.

20:34.972 --> 20:37.497
Oh, I'm sorry, Max, man,
I don't know what I'm saying.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.847
I mean, my arm's
just killing me, man.

20:43.894 --> 20:46.332
Come on, man.We got something, bro.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.858
Yo.
White Shoes, you a nurse?

20:50.901 --> 20:52.207

20:54.253 --> 20:56.255
Come on.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.214
Hey, yo, you, just
be careful, okay?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.303
Hurts like hell.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.133
[grunts, mutters]

21:05.176 --> 21:07.701
[mutters] No, it's not gonna
get infected, will it?

21:07.744 --> 21:09.790
That's the last thing
I need right now.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.226
I'm gonna need more gauze.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.532
ELAINE:
We've got clean towels

21:12.575 --> 21:13.707
in back.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.449
Okay, Bobby, go with her.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.233
BOBBY:Let's go!

21:18.277 --> 21:20.801
Trying to let my boy bleed out?Come on, move!

21:22.759 --> 21:25.153
[phone ringing]

21:25.196 --> 21:27.547
Hey, buddy.
Try and distract them.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.331
I'm getting us out of here.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.115
STOCK [over megaphone]:
This is Commander Stock

21:31.159 --> 21:33.683

Police Department.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.731
We have the diner surrounded.

21:37.774 --> 21:40.342
I repeat:
the diner is surrounded.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.649
The store owner's okay.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.433
He's gonna send
the security video now.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.087
The armored car guys
were picking up diamonds.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.262
They think they managed to hit

21:47.306 --> 21:48.394
one of the robbers.

21:48.437 --> 21:49.743
Anything else?Just this

21:49.786 --> 21:51.179
condom wrapperin the display case.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.746
It's kind of kinky, huh?

21:52.789 --> 21:54.313
TORRES:
Hey, Gibbs,

21:54.356 --> 21:56.184
if there's a way for me
to get under the diner,

21:56.227 --> 21:57.925
there might be a vent
or something I can pop...

21:57.968 --> 21:59.013
Slow down, Nick.

21:59.056 --> 22:01.537
Why don't we just
storm the place?

22:01.581 --> 22:02.973
I mean, we can't
be standing around.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.453
Yeah, we can't be
careless, either,

22:04.497 --> 22:06.368
okay?
One step at a time.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.109
First, we try to talk.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.242
How about you let
some people go,

22:11.286 --> 22:12.896
so we can talk
about this?

22:12.940 --> 22:15.464
Tell them to answer
the damn phone.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.423
STOCK:Answer the phone so we can talk.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.555
Hey, why don't you just
let the girl go, Lenny?

22:19.599 --> 22:22.253
The last thing you need
is a baby on your hands.

22:22.297 --> 22:23.429
It's okay.

22:23.472 --> 22:24.821
I'm not due for weeks.

22:24.865 --> 22:26.388
You say that now, Phyllis,

22:26.432 --> 22:28.912
but once again,
I am not a nurse,

22:28.956 --> 22:30.349
but I've seentoo many movies,

22:30.392 --> 22:32.612
so you tell that baby
to stay put.

22:32.655 --> 22:34.657
I don't have to.
She heard you.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.137
You want to feel better,
sweetie?

22:37.225 --> 22:38.444
Go grab me a beer.

22:38.487 --> 22:39.706
I'm dying of thirst.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.273
No. No, no, no, no.Sit down.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.537
Sit. No booze.

22:44.580 --> 22:47.714
Okay? If you're thirsty,
drink something else.

Please, just let me
get the phone, Max.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.865
What'd you say his name was?
Gibbs?

23:11.215 --> 23:13.479
What do you want, Gibbs?

23:13.522 --> 23:16.699
I want to help you.
What's your name?

23:16.743 --> 23:18.309
Forget my name.

23:18.353 --> 23:20.399
You want to help, you
can start by getting us

23:20.442 --> 23:21.791
a helicopter to
the airport.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.359

23:24.403 --> 23:26.492
No, it's not.
I got this.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.664
A doctor for dead people, yes.Yeah, well,

24:08.708 --> 24:10.361

Max, please!

24:35.430 --> 24:37.214
Please.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.564
Max?

24:40.783 --> 24:43.525
But why make it easy on him?

24:45.005 --> 24:47.181
He can die slow.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.749
To the booths.
Both of you,

24:49.792 --> 24:51.838
get back to the booths!

24:54.971 --> 24:56.625
Bobby's bad, Max.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.409
He needs to get to a
trauma center right now.

24:58.453 --> 25:00.455
Listen to him.
What if he's right?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.501
Yeah, and what if he is?

25:02.544 --> 25:03.806
We're gonna open the doorand let a bunch of cops

25:14.774 --> 25:15.949
What?!

25:15.992 --> 25:17.254
What the hell happened in there?

25:17.298 --> 25:19.518
We just had ourselves
a vigilante, Gibbs.

25:20.823 --> 25:21.781
But everything's okay now.

25:21.824 --> 25:22.999
Prove it.

25:23.043 --> 25:24.523
I want to talk to Palmer.

25:24.566 --> 25:27.830
Afraid your boy Palmer
is a little busy. Right?

25:27.874 --> 25:29.571
We're okay, Gibbs.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.356
And me, I'm losing my patience.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.184
Where are we at
with our helicopter?

25:34.228 --> 25:35.621
We're working on the helicopter.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.971
Yeah, well, work harder.
Or we are gonna start

25:38.014 --> 25:40.669

Did everybodyhear that?!

Bodies!Meaning yours!

25:46.066 --> 25:47.676
No more heroes!

We're not really getting
this guy a helicopter, are we?

25:49.591 --> 25:50.984
No, MPD said no dice.

Yeah, well,
we better get something.

As we now enter hour two

25:55.728 --> 25:57.381
of the standoff in Anacostia,

25:57.425 --> 25:58.861
where law enforcement
is negotiating

25:58.905 --> 25:59.993
with the alleged shooters...

26:00.036 --> 26:02.038
I can't watch anymore, Leon.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.562
I should be down there.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.694
Makes two of us.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.217
First things first,
though. Director,

26:07.261 --> 26:09.045
this is Melissa Spagnolo.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.220
She's the wife

26:10.264 --> 26:11.395
of our current victim.

26:11.439 --> 26:12.701
You sure it's really Danny?

26:12.745 --> 26:14.311
Well, that's whatyou're here to confirm.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.879
Now, if you have any ideas at
all about who's responsible.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.272
I've got some ideas, all right.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.579
Yeah, you know what, McGee?
I-I'll take her.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.058
You get down to the diner.You sure, Jack?

26:22.102 --> 26:23.886
Absolutely. Hi, Melissa.Special Agent Sloane.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.105
Please come this way.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.324
You know, I had no idea
about any of this

26:27.368 --> 26:29.718
until Nick called me in the cara couple minutes ago.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.894
Did he mention the jewelry storesecurity footage?

26:31.938 --> 26:33.461
He did.
Why, is it here?

26:33.504 --> 26:34.984
Yeah.
Just came in, I'm afraid.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.638
I'm not going anywhere, am I?Agent McGee, we don't know

26:36.682 --> 26:38.118
who these guys are.
And if there's anything

26:38.161 --> 26:39.946
on that footage
that can help us,

26:39.989 --> 26:41.904
you're the best person hereto find it. Come on.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.123
I'll help you.Let's go.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.649
You really gonna let him die?

26:48.868 --> 26:49.999
You're both
okay with adding

26:50.043 --> 26:51.653
murder charges
to your day?

26:51.697 --> 26:54.482
Shut up.

26:54.525 --> 26:57.616
Man, this isn't
what I signed up for.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.269
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

26:59.313 --> 27:00.619
Nothing?

27:02.185 --> 27:04.448
You two, go on, help him.

27:04.492 --> 27:05.754
Come on.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.365
Don't you turn on me, Lenny.I'm not.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.672
I just want to get out of here
without anyone else dying.

27:10.716 --> 27:14.197
Well, okay, then shut up
and do what I say.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.852
I mean, do you think
that I wanted any of this?

27:16.896 --> 27:20.464
Sit down, Lenny.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.294
Uh, we'll be okay, right?

27:25.948 --> 27:27.820
What scares me is if Gibbs
doesn't get here in time,

27:27.863 --> 27:29.735
then it might come down
to kill or be killed.

27:29.778 --> 27:33.477
What do you mean...
You mean us kill them?

27:33.521 --> 27:34.740
Before they kill us, yes.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.439
I mean, if we want to get
out of here, we might have to.

27:38.482 --> 27:39.701
Kasie...

27:41.224 --> 27:44.053
I'm not sure that I can do that.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.315
Can you?

27:48.536 --> 27:51.844
Well, they're doing pretty mucheverything Torres told me about,

27:51.887 --> 27:53.106
but with those ski masks...

27:53.149 --> 27:55.543
Yeah, this isn'tgetting us much.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.501
Wait.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.416
What... what are those?

27:59.460 --> 28:01.549
Oh, my God, that's what Nickwas talking about.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.029
I thought he had mentioned
something about

28:03.072 --> 28:05.379
a condom wrapper, but I wasn't
sure I heard him right.

28:05.422 --> 28:06.815
What are they doing with them?

28:06.859 --> 28:08.774
Diamonds.

28:08.817 --> 28:11.777
Shop owner told Nick and
Ellie they were priceless.

28:11.820 --> 28:14.214
So priceless that they're
putting them in condoms.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.998
Don't tell me...

28:16.042 --> 28:17.173
Oh, no.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.784
Oh, no.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.960
Ooh, no.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.701
I've heard of drug
mules before, but...

28:22.744 --> 28:25.312
But that is commitment.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.357
Uh...

28:27.401 --> 28:28.576
Yeah, Jack.

28:28.619 --> 28:29.708
Hey. Meet me in autopsy.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.361
I need you to hear this.

28:31.405 --> 28:32.841
[indistinct]

28:35.801 --> 28:37.019
Hey, didn't you go?

28:37.063 --> 28:38.194
I had some work for him to do.

28:38.238 --> 28:39.674
And you won't believe
what we found.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.328
I take it you were ableto make a positive ID,

28:41.371 --> 28:43.069
Mrs. Spagnolo?

28:43.112 --> 28:45.724
Uh, yes, she was, and Melissa,
tell them what you told me.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.422
My Danny made a lot of
mistakes in his life,

28:48.465 --> 28:50.250
but he has a good heart.

28:50.293 --> 28:52.556
Again, we are very sorryfor your loss, but can you skip

28:52.600 --> 28:54.384
to the part aboutDanny's new friends, please?

28:54.428 --> 28:57.170
I never called them friends.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.999
With all the cops
at the parade across town,

29:00.042 --> 29:02.479
they were gonna rob diamonds
from some jewelry shop.

29:02.523 --> 29:04.394
Danny was just
the driver.

29:04.438 --> 29:05.874
He promised to send me
a ticket to Argentina

29:05.918 --> 29:07.876
to join him after.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.748
This crew--
can you give us names?

29:09.791 --> 29:11.706
Uh, already got them.
Max, Lenny and Bobby.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.621
She doesn't know last names.U-Uh, no, wait.

29:13.664 --> 29:14.796
Max's last name
was something like

29:14.840 --> 29:17.016
demon o-or devil... the...[sighs]

29:17.059 --> 29:18.017
Devin!

29:18.060 --> 29:19.322
Devendorf.Max Devendorf.

29:19.366 --> 29:20.541
Devendorf.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.021
Got it.Good. Good.

29:22.064 --> 29:24.806
Uh, dig up everything you can,get it to Agent Gibbs. Go.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.113
Thank you.
That was great.

29:27.156 --> 29:28.810
McGEE:
They swallowed the diamonds.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.377
So that's what
the condom was for.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.552
That's commitment.

29:31.595 --> 29:33.206
Get back to Max.

29:33.249 --> 29:34.555
Anything else we know?

29:34.598 --> 29:35.991
Well, not much beyond
his mile-long rap sheet

29:36.035 --> 29:37.863
and history of violence.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.821
SLOANE:
And the fact that
he and his pals likely killed

29:39.865 --> 29:41.954
one of their ownright before the big heist.

29:41.997 --> 29:44.173
If they'd kill their own...They'd have no trouble

29:44.217 --> 29:46.872
killing anyone else.Or everyone else.

29:46.915 --> 29:48.917
Boss, are you sure you
don't need us down there?

29:48.961 --> 29:52.268
No, not yet.
We'll let you know.

29:52.312 --> 29:53.792
And trust me, McGee,
there's plenty of us here

29:53.835 --> 29:55.141
waiting for something to happen.

29:55.184 --> 29:57.491
Thanks. Well,
the wait is over.

29:57.534 --> 30:00.407
Our "Trojan horse"
has arrived.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.452
[phone ringing]

30:06.413 --> 30:07.631
You got our helicopter, Gibbs?

30:07.675 --> 30:09.372
Yeah, we do.

30:09.416 --> 30:10.809
But if you expect to get on it,

30:10.852 --> 30:12.941
you and me are gonna talk
face-to-face.

30:12.985 --> 30:15.901
I'm coming in.No, no, you're not.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.424
I'll come to you.

30:18.947 --> 30:21.732
I'm right outside.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.647
You.

30:23.691 --> 30:24.866
No.Come on.

30:24.910 --> 30:25.954
No, please.Come on, come on.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.521
Where are you taking her?

30:27.564 --> 30:30.002
It's none of your
business. How's Bobby?

30:31.394 --> 30:33.527
He's bleeding.
A lot.

30:33.570 --> 30:34.658
You're letting her go?

30:34.702 --> 30:36.095
No. I just... I needed a shieldNo, no.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.748
while I talk to your man Gibbs.All right, Max,

30:37.792 --> 30:40.055
take me, take me.No.

30:40.099 --> 30:42.884
No, you need to save Bobby.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.973
Then take me.
Take me.

30:45.017 --> 30:46.366
You want to be
safe out there,

30:46.409 --> 30:48.411
Gibbs loves me like a daughter.Doesn't he, Jimmy?

30:48.455 --> 30:50.718
Or-or at least
like a favorite niece.

30:52.415 --> 30:53.808
It's okay.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.854
He thinks the world of her.

30:58.465 --> 31:01.076
Okay, come on.
Fine, whatever. Come on.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.296
Let's go. Come on.

31:04.601 --> 31:05.689
[grunts]

31:05.733 --> 31:06.908
Out you go.It's okay.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.605
Let's go.It's okay.

31:13.045 --> 31:16.265
Happy Saint Paddy's Day, Gibbs.

31:16.309 --> 31:18.789
Same to you, Kase.
Everybody okay in there?

31:18.833 --> 31:20.400
No, not everyone, no.

31:20.443 --> 31:22.271
One of those better be mine.

31:24.621 --> 31:27.276
Oh, no.No, your helicopter's in a field

31:27.320 --> 31:28.582
a quarter mile away.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.758
I'm driving you
there personally.

31:30.801 --> 31:33.674
That is not what I asked for.

31:35.328 --> 31:37.199
It's what you got, Max.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.723
You know my name now?We know a lot.

31:39.767 --> 31:42.291
Be a good time to start
letting go of people.

31:42.335 --> 31:43.945
You can start with Kasie.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.382
No. Not me, Gibbs.
If anyone should go first,

31:46.426 --> 31:48.297
it should be Shayne,
since he got shot.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.473
And Phyllis, too. She is way
too pregnant to be here.

31:50.517 --> 31:51.561
Come on, you got
your hands full.

31:51.605 --> 31:53.085
We can take some
of that weight off.

31:53.128 --> 31:56.088
Paramedics-- they're here,
they're ready to go.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.482
Okay, fine. Fine.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.397
The pregnant girl first.

32:01.441 --> 32:04.313
You don't get the hero
until we're on the chopper.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.359
And the waitress can go
once we board our flight.

32:06.402 --> 32:07.969
What about my two?

32:08.013 --> 32:10.189
No, no, no. They're coming
with us as insurance.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.842
And to take care of my guy.

32:11.886 --> 32:13.148
Your guy needs a hospital.

32:13.192 --> 32:16.238
My guy will be fine
until we land.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.675
You think he's gonna make it
all the way to Argentina?

32:18.719 --> 32:20.329
Argentina?
W... There's no way.

32:20.373 --> 32:21.940
How the hell do you
know where we're going?

32:21.983 --> 32:23.724
It's my job to know.

32:23.767 --> 32:26.553
Just like you and your buddies
smashing through glass cases

32:26.596 --> 32:29.338
and swallowing condoms
full of diamonds.

32:29.382 --> 32:30.557
Did you really do that?

32:30.600 --> 32:32.037
Oh, man, that is commitment.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.952
Killed your buddy Danny, too,
didn't you?

32:33.995 --> 32:36.998
There is no honoramong thieves, is there, Max?

32:37.042 --> 32:39.783
LENNY:
Max, get in here, quick!

32:39.827 --> 32:41.742
Come on.Wait...

32:45.920 --> 32:47.704
How the hell could he
have known all that?

32:47.748 --> 32:49.532
It's only been three hours.

32:49.576 --> 32:51.882
I'm sorry, Bobby.
I'm so sorry, man.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.232
We should have
called an ambulance.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.278
What happened?

32:56.322 --> 32:58.063
What do you think happened?

32:58.106 --> 33:00.282
He stopped breathing.
Cardiac arrest.

33:01.457 --> 33:03.068
Yo, don't let him die!

33:03.111 --> 33:05.635
Hey, yo, keep fighting, Bobby,
don't you die on us!

33:09.422 --> 33:10.814
Change of plans.

33:10.858 --> 33:12.468
What are you doing, Max?

33:12.512 --> 33:14.035
Bobby's not gonna
make it, Len, okay?

33:14.079 --> 33:15.994
And he's just...
he's just gonna slow us down.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.386
No, yo, but Max...

33:17.430 --> 33:19.388
I'm sorry, Bobby,

33:19.432 --> 33:21.260
but we have no choice here.

33:23.044 --> 33:25.003
Just let go.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.181
He's already gone, man.

33:33.359 --> 33:34.664
So now what?

33:34.708 --> 33:37.058
Yeah. Now what?

33:50.158 --> 33:52.160
Now...

34:06.000 --> 34:07.523
Now you cut him open.

34:19.144 --> 34:21.842
Cut him open?

34:21.885 --> 34:23.844
You heard me.Hey.

34:23.887 --> 34:26.151
No way, Max.No way what?

34:26.194 --> 34:28.457
Did you think I was just gonna
let us leave without them?

34:28.501 --> 34:30.981
Without what?
W-What am I looking for here?

34:31.025 --> 34:32.287
You'll know it when you see it.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.420
And you won't believe it.

34:34.463 --> 34:36.465
GIBBS:Where'd you go, Max?

34:41.818 --> 34:43.472
We're ready to go out here.

34:43.516 --> 34:44.865
This has to happen now, Gibbs,

34:44.908 --> 34:47.041
or it's not gonna beup to us anymore.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.262
Clock's ticking!

34:50.305 --> 34:51.872
We're short on time!

34:53.743 --> 34:55.354
Start cutting.

34:55.397 --> 34:56.833
Now.

35:05.059 --> 35:07.540
Oh, man, I can't watch this.

35:15.722 --> 35:17.724
[whispering]:
What did Gibbs tell you?

35:17.767 --> 35:20.161
He knew their whole plan.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.294
And from the way he repeated it,he clearly wanted us

35:22.337 --> 35:24.905
to know it, too.Tell me exactly what he said.

35:24.948 --> 35:26.515
They smashed a glass case
full of diamonds,

35:26.559 --> 35:29.127
which they then poured
into condoms, which they...

35:29.170 --> 35:30.780
I mean, I hate to say it.

35:30.824 --> 35:32.173
Down the hatch.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.306
Oh, man, that's commitment.That's what I said.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.785
So that's what I'm supposed
to be looking for?

35:35.829 --> 35:37.004
Yeah.

35:37.047 --> 35:38.397
Did you find it yet?

35:38.440 --> 35:39.920
He just got started.

35:39.963 --> 35:42.488
I-I'll find them fast.
Promise.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.361
So they don't care
about Bobby at all, huh?

35:46.405 --> 35:47.754
They just want
what's inside of him?

35:47.797 --> 35:49.538
GIBBS:
Your ride's waiting, Max!

35:49.582 --> 35:50.757
What's it gonna be?

35:50.800 --> 35:53.673
Come on, what is taking so long?

35:53.716 --> 35:56.328
I'm hurrying, Max,
uh, no worries.

35:58.286 --> 35:59.374
Would you stop it?

35:59.418 --> 36:01.159
What?Enough

36:01.202 --> 36:03.161
with all the pleases
and thank yous, please.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.337
Oh, come on, I didn't say
either one of those.You don't have to.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.817
'Cause you imply it
with every polite word.

36:07.861 --> 36:09.819
[phone ringing]

36:10.864 --> 36:13.171
Enough with the phone.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.873
Enough!

36:19.916 --> 36:22.702
Well, I'd say
he's done negotiating.

36:22.745 --> 36:25.139
Come on, Gibbs,let's get in there.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.706
It's out of my hands, Gibbs.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.360
My bosses upstairs want this
turned over to special ops

36:28.403 --> 36:29.535
right now.Stall them.

36:29.578 --> 36:31.058
Those are our people.

36:31.101 --> 36:33.887
I can maybe get
you five minutes.

36:36.063 --> 36:38.370
It's time.
Roll the dice.

36:38.413 --> 36:39.893
That was stupid.

36:39.936 --> 36:41.851
What did you say?

36:41.895 --> 36:42.896
I said...

36:44.941 --> 36:46.943
...that was stupid.

36:48.118 --> 36:49.859
We needed that phone.

36:49.903 --> 36:53.472
I'll show you stupid if youdon't get me my diamonds.

36:53.515 --> 36:55.387
Yeah, that's all
bullies care about.

36:55.430 --> 36:57.476
Me, me, me.
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

36:57.519 --> 37:00.261
Puff out your chest. You're morescared than anyone else in here.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.134
Hey, Jimmy,
i-isn't that the stomach?

37:06.528 --> 37:08.487
Yeah, that's the stomach.

37:09.792 --> 37:12.447
You want your diamonds or not,
big shot?

37:15.711 --> 37:17.800
Just make it fast.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.764
That's you not being polite?

37:24.807 --> 37:26.592
What? Oh, no, no.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.289
That's me trying
to throw him off.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.204
I mean, losing that phone meansthat Gibbs is gonna come through

37:30.248 --> 37:31.945
that door any
second now.

37:31.988 --> 37:34.295
We need him distracted.

37:37.211 --> 37:40.475
Two minutes, starting now.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.303
U-Uh, uh-huh.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.305
I got it.
I got the condom.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.788
All right, and I've gota distraction. Cut it open.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.616
What?

37:50.659 --> 37:52.357
The condom.
Cut it. Play along.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.489
Okay, all right.
Hold on.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.971
Okay, it's cut.

37:58.014 --> 37:59.712
Here it is.
Jimmy found your diamonds.

37:59.755 --> 38:03.193
A condom, huh? Yeah.
That is clever.

38:03.237 --> 38:05.500
Whatever works.Come on, hand it over.

38:05.544 --> 38:08.329
Uh-oh, hang on.How did it break? Is that glass?

38:08.373 --> 38:09.591
JIMMY:
It sure is.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.289
MAX:The condom.

38:11.332 --> 38:12.290
Give it to me.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.683
Maybe not so clever.

38:14.727 --> 38:15.945
What are you talking about?

38:15.989 --> 38:18.165
Uh, whatever glass bits
got mixed in

38:18.208 --> 38:19.645
with your diamonds, they

38:19.688 --> 38:21.124
shredded the condom
right open.

38:21.168 --> 38:23.518
Yeah, shredded Bobby's
stomach lining. Look at this.

38:23.562 --> 38:26.347
The pyloric canal?You know, I'd say if the bullethadn't killed him...

38:26.391 --> 38:29.132
The internal bleeding
sure would have. And quick.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.134
Oh, man.[sniffles]

38:31.178 --> 38:33.354
Oh, no.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.791
Oh, no, what?
Wait...

38:35.835 --> 38:38.620
Don't tell me you guys
swallowed diamonds, too.

38:38.664 --> 38:41.188
Oh, that's right.
Gibbs said they did.

38:43.930 --> 38:47.194
Wait, are you feeling
any, um, abdominal pain?

38:47.237 --> 38:48.935
Any stomach cramping,
any nausea?

38:50.415 --> 38:52.199
Yo, man, I sure as hell
feel something.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.464
No, no.
No pain.

38:56.508 --> 38:58.118
No pain here.

38:58.161 --> 38:59.685
You both look pretty pale.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.513
Yeah, that's a sure sign
of blood loss.

39:01.556 --> 39:02.905
Yeah.LENNY:Max,

39:02.949 --> 39:04.864
I'm freaking out here, man.

39:04.907 --> 39:07.388
JIMMY:
Uh, you feeling any dull
throbbing in your back,

39:07.432 --> 39:09.695
your joints?Man, I feel all of that.

39:09.738 --> 39:12.350
There's-there's no way.
T-They're bluffing.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.395
I wish we were, Max, but you'reboth bleeding internally.

39:14.439 --> 39:15.875
JIMMY:
And if Bobby is
any indication,

39:15.918 --> 39:17.877
you guys could be dead.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.400
With-Within minutes.Oh, man.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.575
Here.
You need to drink more.

39:20.619 --> 39:22.055
Fluids will help flush it out.

39:22.098 --> 39:24.492
No, this isn't real.
You're lying.

39:24.536 --> 39:25.972
Yo, the hell with this, Max!

39:26.015 --> 39:28.235
Man, we got to get out of here!I need a doctor, man!

39:28.278 --> 39:30.411
No, Lenny, wait! Stop!Hey, don't shoot!

39:30.455 --> 39:31.978
GIBBS: Max, it's over!LENNY: Don't shoot, don't shoot!

39:35.938 --> 39:38.114
OFFICER:
I got medevac. Let's go.On your knees.

39:38.158 --> 39:39.768
I need a doctor!

39:41.161 --> 39:42.554
GIBBS:You got him. Enough.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.904
Enough.You got him, Palmer.

39:44.947 --> 39:46.079
Hey! Enough.

39:46.122 --> 39:48.951
It's okay, Gibbs, it's okay.Get up.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.302
Guy just crossed his line.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.174
What took you so long, Gibbs?

39:55.784 --> 39:57.612
Hey, hey, hey.
All clear!

39:57.656 --> 39:59.092
All clear.

39:59.135 --> 40:01.137
We need a medic.We got a man down.

40:07.579 --> 40:10.886
Medical clearance is one thing,
Dr. Palmer, Ms. Hines,

40:10.930 --> 40:13.280
but after that ordeal,
it's important that you know

40:13.323 --> 40:14.847
that more help is available.

40:16.022 --> 40:18.154
Jack Sloane.
Or Dr. Grace.

40:19.504 --> 40:20.505
[mouths]

40:20.548 --> 40:22.028
I just can't believe
that you managed

40:22.071 --> 40:24.334
to convince two
hardened criminals

40:24.378 --> 40:26.424
that they swallowed
broken glass.

40:26.467 --> 40:29.514
Well, I think we can attributethat to the power of suggestion.

40:29.557 --> 40:31.037
Well, yeah, but you two
had to sell it.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.560
Oh, yeah, we were good.

40:32.604 --> 40:35.563
Turning blind fearinto quite the performance.

40:35.607 --> 40:37.696
In honor of Saint Pat's,
I'd say we were throwing out

40:37.739 --> 40:39.437
some good old-fashioned blarney.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.395
Blarney?
Like the stone?

40:41.439 --> 40:44.442
Uh, blarney also means having
a good line of bull.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.269
You know, like,to charm,

40:46.313 --> 40:47.488
persuade.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.491
Well, that and my eye drops.

40:50.535 --> 40:53.712
Even just a couple drops of thisstuff can give anyone, uh,

40:53.755 --> 40:56.018
shall we say, tummy troubles?

40:56.062 --> 40:58.064
How many drops
did you give them, Kase?

40:58.107 --> 41:00.370
All of them. Once Bobby
started pouring iced tea,

41:00.414 --> 41:02.242
I poured most of that baby

41:02.285 --> 41:03.635
into that pitcher.

41:03.678 --> 41:05.550
Sneaky.Oh, yeah.

41:05.593 --> 41:06.986
Well...

41:08.466 --> 41:10.380
here's to being home safely,

41:10.424 --> 41:12.295
and here's to eye drops.

41:12.339 --> 41:13.471
And blarney.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.168
And friends who have your back.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.431
And to the luck of the Irish.

41:18.432 --> 41:19.868
Hear, hear.
