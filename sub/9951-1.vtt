[knock at door]
- Agent Parker?

00:12.721 --> 00:15.804
- Oh, no.
No, no, no.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.798
- Agent Parker? Where are you?
[knocking]

00:22.898 --> 00:24.889
- God, it's kind of early,
isn't it?

00:25.025 --> 00:29.109
Hey, boss.
- Couldn't wait.

00:29.238 --> 00:32.401
It's impressive how little
you've done with...

00:32.533 --> 00:34.069
so little.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.737
- Well, it's what I do
with all the vacation time

00:35.869 --> 00:36.904
that I don't get.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.028
Hit a bunch
of outlet stores

00:39.164 --> 00:41.826
and furniture shop with
all the guys that I don't meet.

00:41.959 --> 00:45.042
- Never took you for, uh...
teenage vampires.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.502
- Oh, well, you should see
what I read on the plane.

00:47.631 --> 00:51.044
- FBI is nonfiction work.
I need you to keep it that way.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.588
- Is this about Miami?

00:53.720 --> 00:56.712
- Oh, yeah.
I'm talking about Miami.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.100
We've been through this.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.932
- You know, being open
to possibilities

01:01.061 --> 01:02.517
is how we close cases,

01:02.646 --> 01:04.511
like that one.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.855
- It sends you
down blind alleys too.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.770
- Yeah, well, where I grew up,

01:08.902 --> 01:11.518
a blind alley was even
better than reality.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.280
So, uh, where are you
sending me this time?

01:15.409 --> 01:18.526
- Haven.
Maine.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.369
Hometown of one
Jonas Lester.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.331
He escaped a federal
lockup 19 hours ago.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.835
Killed a guard doing it.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.043
Find Lester.
Bring him back.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.163
Nothing else.
That's your reality.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.884
- You're a good agent,
Audrey.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.128
And someday, maybe,
you'll be a great agent.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.472
Just focus on the job.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.268
- Put the book on the table
when you're done with it.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.651
[heavy breathing]

02:13.800 --> 02:17.133
- Stop!

02:17.262 --> 02:19.719
Stop, damn it!

02:19.848 --> 02:22.681
Stop! Stop, damn it!

02:22.809 --> 02:24.345
Don't make me shoot you!

02:24.478 --> 02:27.265
Ugh!

02:57.386 --> 02:59.297
Six of Tommy Bolt's seven
missing fingers

02:59.429 --> 03:00.635
have been returned.

03:00.764 --> 03:04.723

03:23.995 --> 03:26.122
J‘ Think of me, babe,

03:26.248 --> 03:27.488

No.

God!

03:52.733 --> 03:53.722
- You need some help?

03:53.859 --> 03:57.272
- No.
No, I'm all right. Thank you.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.567
- Oh. Okay, then.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.241
- Unbelievable.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.501
[grunts]

04:14.629 --> 04:16.460
Whoa!

04:16.590 --> 04:18.581
crash!

04:19.926 --> 04:22.918
[glass shattering]

04:24.306 --> 04:28.299
- Shame about the car.
- Eh, it's a rental.

04:31.855 --> 04:35.143
Whoa! FBI! Who are you?
- Haven PD. Who are you?

04:35.275 --> 04:38.733
- FBI. Are you deaf?
- How do I know that?

04:38.862 --> 04:41.228
- Okay, well, for starters,
I'm wearing the gun

04:41.364 --> 04:42.353
on my belt.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.527
It's a government-issue
9-millimeter.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.615
And they gave me, you know,
one of these.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.485
- Hey, keep your hands
where I can see them.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.113
- Okay, what am I going to do,
pull out another gun?

04:59.216 --> 05:01.707
All right.
Come on, I showed you mine.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.674
Okay.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.814
So, uh, are all your roads
this bad?

05:21.947 --> 05:24.484
- Sandstone.
Likes to shift.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.026
- Uh-huh.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.990
- Can I give
you a ride somewhere?

05:28.119 --> 05:29.074
- I guess it's friendlier

05:29.204 --> 05:30.990
than if I commandeer
your vehicle.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.499
- Probably less
paperwork too.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.996
- Thank you.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.996
Oh! I'm sorry.
Are—are you all right?

05:41.132 --> 05:42.633
- It's all right.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.919
I didn't feel it.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.969
- Huh.
Tough guy, huh?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.727
Hey, uh I don't suppose
you've seen

05:56.857 --> 05:59.223
a guy named Jonas Lester
recently?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.850
- Just left him.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.494
- Well, keep looking
all you want.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.003
This man's pretty dead.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.745
Tends not to change much.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.669
- Chief Wuornos, this is—
- Special Agent Audrey Parker.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.792
- Oh, it's the FBI.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.213
Well, is this
one of those situations

06:28.346 --> 06:29.597
where you're here
claiming to help,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.714
but you're really
just here to step on my toes?

06:31.850 --> 06:33.761
- Not in these shoes.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.977
I came here, actually,
looking for him.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.390
- Yeah.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.639
Yeah, we got the alert
when Jonas, here, escaped.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.608
- The Bureau thought that
he might return to his hometown.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.069
I guess he did.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.908
Ah!

06:49.034 --> 06:51.116
Somebody missed something.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.111
There's writing on it.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.410
I can't read whatever this is,
but it's worth checking out.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.282
- I'll get it
to the lab in Bangor.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.831
- Well, why don't you
enlighten us?

07:01.963 --> 07:04.750
What does the FBI Special Agent
have in the way of insight?

07:04.883 --> 07:08.296
- Well, his injuries don't
suggest a struggle.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.794
I don't think
he was dragged here.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.887
- You don't?
- He died last night.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.176
But your guys are going
to have to give us

07:14.309 --> 07:15.219
the exact time.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.558
At first glance,

07:16.686 --> 07:17.801
it looks like he fell
from up there,

07:17.938 --> 07:19.894
but his body is way too far
from the edge.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.309
You know, unless there's
a cannon up there or something.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.684
Anyway, I'm not sold
on it being an accident.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.481
- You're over-thinking this.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.447
The best thing Jonas Lester
ever did for this town

07:30.575 --> 07:32.156
was die.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.150
So as far as I'm concerned,
we're done.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.664
- He killed a federal employee,
so my investigation isn't done

07:36.790 --> 07:38.075
until I know why
he came back here

07:38.208 --> 07:39.539
and what happened to him.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.876
- Nathan, get yourself a real
crime to investigate here, eh?

07:43.004 --> 07:44.960
- Chief, how about
I show Agent Parker around

07:45.090 --> 07:47.001
while we tie up the loose ends?

07:47.133 --> 07:49.169
- Go ahead.
Waste his time too.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.418
He's got nothing else
to do with it.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.094
[phone ringing]

07:57.227 --> 08:00.344
- Howard.
- It's Parker.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.937
Lester's dead.
- HoW'd it happened?

08:03.066 --> 08:04.647
- Well, they're calling
it an accident,

08:04.776 --> 08:07.483
but something
doesn't seem right.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.523
- Sounds right up your alley,
Agent Parker.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.645
- Chief Wuornos
doesn't think so.

08:10.782 --> 08:11.817
- I trust your instincts.

08:11.950 --> 08:15.113
- I'm working with a local
detective, uh...

08:15.245 --> 08:17.987
- Wuornos.

08:18.123 --> 08:21.490
- You call your dad the Chief?
- I call my boss the Chief.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.706
- He's a stubborn man.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.952
What's his deal?
Is he testing me?

08:25.088 --> 08:26.919
- Not you. Me.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.379
- Hey, no offence,
but half the reason

08:28.508 --> 08:31.215
I want to solve this case
is just to piss him off.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.050
- And it would.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.841
- I guess that's one advantage
of being raised by the state:

08:35.974 --> 08:38.636
not much parental conflict.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.805
- So you're an orphan?
- I'm a free agent.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.224
Tuwiuwok.
Is that Native American?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.939
- Micmac, yeah.
It means "Haven."

08:47.068 --> 08:49.024
- It's easier to spell,
I guess.

08:53.825 --> 08:57.067
Huh. This must be
Lester's footprints.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.821
It looks like they're chasing
a second set right...here.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.916
And Lester's end...

09:05.045 --> 09:07.081
abruptly, here.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.374
- Could be.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.051
- Uprooted trees?

09:12.177 --> 09:13.542
Well, that—that's strange.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.294
You guys get tornadoes up here
this time of year?

09:16.431 --> 09:19.343
- Maybe...one a year.
- Really?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.262
'Cause something did a number
on these trees.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.851
- No wind last night.
I already checked.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.095
- You did?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.608
- Couldn't find
a cannon either.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.974
- [chuckles]

09:37.368 --> 09:39.233
Now we're talking.

09:39.370 --> 09:42.362
- Nice gun,
though Lester wasn't shot.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.866
I did find this.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.208
-Ahat?

09:47.337 --> 09:49.293
- I know a guy who wears
a hat like this.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.287
- So do I, but that doesn't
make it evidence.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.255
- Well, Lester stole
all my guy's money.

09:53.384 --> 09:57.468
- Well, okay.
So that makes it evidence.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.134
Let's go talk to your guy.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.633
- Welcome to Haven.
You like pancakes?

10:03.770 --> 10:05.977
We got good pancakes.
- What about lobster?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.687
And isn't Maine
famous for lobster?

10:07.816 --> 10:08.896
- I don't like lobster.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.607
I really like pancakes.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.522
- I like the truck.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.611
- Thanks.
Had it since I was 19.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.731
- How do you keep
a car that long?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.778
- I don't drive off cliffs.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.919
-So...

10:29.045 --> 10:30.546
who's this hat
belong to?

10:30.672 --> 10:33.960
- Conrad Brower,
Gulf War vet, local handyman.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.003
Went into the service with
Lester.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.218
Conrad came out
an unemployed hero.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.837
Lester came out a loser
with computer skills.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.965
Did time for stealing
VA benefits

10:43.101 --> 10:44.557
from guys he was in with.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.519
- Including Conrad.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.607
- Hey, Conrad.
- Nathan.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.020
- Helping Marion again?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.860
- That's what I do.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.857
- Found your hat
up on Tuwiuwok Bluff.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.951
- Thanks.
Appreciate it.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.580
- Uh, were you out there
yesterday evening?

11:04.706 --> 11:07.197
- Maintain the perimeter.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.416
Please.
- What?

11:10.545 --> 11:13.628
- Uh, Conrad has
personal space issues.

11:13.756 --> 11:14.745
- Right.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.591
Pardon me, Mr. Brower.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.887
Any particular time

11:20.013 --> 11:21.674
you were planning
on answering my question?

11:21.806 --> 11:24.092
- I was up there this morning.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.433
I like to watch
the boats head out.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.551
Forgot the hat, I guess.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.519
- And you never
saw Jonas Lester?

11:30.648 --> 11:33.390
- Not moving.
- But you did know him.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.642
- You mean the service.
- Right.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.235
And then when he got out,
he stole all your money.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.070
- Notjust mine.
I know where you're going.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.065
- Conrad.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.990
Yesterday, late afternoon,
evening, where were you?

11:46.122 --> 11:49.990
- Digging clams.
Out to Edgewater Bay.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.787
Till sunset.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.579
- All right, you speak
monosyllable.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.421
You want to try
to break through his perimeter

11:57.550 --> 11:59.131
while I go inside
and talk to the shop owner?

11:59.260 --> 12:00.841
- Sure.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.465
- Where are you going?

12:03.598 --> 12:04.929
- Mr. Brower,
if you have something

12:05.058 --> 12:07.049
that you want to tell me,
you go right on ahead.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.989
That's weird.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.873
Conrad? Conrad!

12:40.510 --> 12:41.750
- He's gone.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.966
[horn honking]

12:43.096 --> 12:46.429
[tires screeching]

12:46.599 --> 12:48.009
- Look out!
- [gasps]

12:48.142 --> 12:49.803
[tires squealing]

12:51.271 --> 12:53.728
Nathan! Watch out!

13:01.155 --> 13:04.147
[siren wailing]

13:06.786 --> 13:08.822
- Congratulations, Nathan.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.820
Now you get to come back
with me for an MRI.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.164
Another.
- Lucky number nine.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.158
- Yeah. Cheer up.
The tenth one's free.

13:15.295 --> 13:19.664
He's a regular.
I'll be back in a jiff.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.586
- So you seriously
can't feel pain?

13:22.719 --> 13:25.677
- It's called idiopathic
neuropathy.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.920
- You really couldn't feel it

13:27.056 --> 13:28.842
when that car door
hit your hand?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.136
- No.
- Can you feel fire?

13:31.269 --> 13:32.349
- No.
- Ice?

13:32.478 --> 13:34.139
- Oddly, yes.
I can feel ice.

13:34.272 --> 13:37.184
- You can feel ice?
- No.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.524
I can feel a headache
coming on, though.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.143
- Hey,
so that was strange.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.236
I've never seen
fog like that before.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.981
- Maine gets lots
of kinds of fog.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.484
- All right.
Get in the back.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.360
- Oh, I can drive myself.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.362
- I'm not arguing
with you, Nathan.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.909
The back.
- [groans]

13:55.043 --> 13:56.499
- Go.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.913
I'll call the Bureau
then check out Conrad's alibi.

13:59.047 --> 14:02.039
- Eleanor, you're overreacting.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.507
- Howard.
- Agent Howard, yeah.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.795
I'm still here.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.884
I haven't found anything,
nothing relevant anyway.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.470
But I'll keep in touch.
- Okay, bye.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.554
- You must be Agent Parker.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.059
I understand
youTeinvesﬂgaﬂng

14:12.185 --> 14:13.345
Jonas Lester's death.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.558
- And you are...

14:14.687 --> 14:16.848
- Dave Tiggs.
My brother, Vince.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.721
Publishers, editors,
and every damn thing else

14:18.858 --> 14:20.223
in the Haven Herald.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.645
- We thought Lester'd be
our lead,

14:21.778 --> 14:22.893
but now it'll be the fog.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.065
- Yeah.
That fog was strange, right?

14:25.198 --> 14:27.405
- Well, welcome to Haven.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.569
- I keep feeling like
I've seen you before.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.442
- Didn't sound creepy at all.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.991
- Oh, Lord. It does.
Doesn't it?

14:34.123 --> 14:35.579
- Only because you said it,
Vince.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.915
How about we drop by later

14:38.044 --> 14:40.376
and you can answer
a few questions about the case?

14:40.505 --> 14:42.086
- How about I just call you?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.001
- Oh! Fierce, isn't she?

14:44.133 --> 14:46.340
- Well, change your mind,
drop by.

14:46.469 --> 14:49.256
- We serve
Mai Tais at 3:00.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.299
- Okay.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.841
- I want to ride
in the front this time.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.839
- No, no.
I always ride in the front.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.228
- Well, it's my turn now.
- Agent Parker.

14:56.354 --> 14:59.596
MRls are overrated.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.063
Let's go talk to Marion.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.444
- Nathan.
ls everyone all right out there?

15:07.573 --> 15:08.688
- They will be.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.862
This is Audrey Parker
with the FBI.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.325
Marion Caldwell.
- Hello.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.365
- This is my friend
Ted Ford.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.661
- Hello.
- Is this Santa Barbara?

15:18.793 --> 15:20.624
- Yes.
Have you been there?

15:20.753 --> 15:21.959
- Twice.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.670
Once for a pedophile,
the other for a serial killer.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.590
- Marion and l are thinking
of moving there

15:28.719 --> 15:29.674
and buying a shop.

15:29.804 --> 15:33.296
- Oh! Oh.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.266
It's beautiful.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.601
It's beautiful,
and it's a lot safer now.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.971
- Well, we're just flirting
with the idea.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.598
- Marion lost her mother
not long ago,

15:43.734 --> 15:45.986
and, well, I think the change
will do her some good.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.943
- Ted's had antique
shops all over,

15:48.072 --> 15:50.233
but I've never left Haven,
so it's a big step.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.573
- Uh, Conrad Brower,
he works for you, right?

15:52.702 --> 15:53.862
- Yes, he does.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.826
He's been very helpful
since my mother passed.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.162
- And how well
do you know him?

15:58.291 --> 15:59.997
- Oh, we grew up together.
- What's this about?

16:00.126 --> 16:02.162
- Do either
of you know Jonas Lester?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.956
[phone ringing]
- The guy who died?

16:04.088 --> 16:07.672
I heard about it.
- Excuse me. Hey.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.086
- Do you know where
Conrad was last night?

16:10.219 --> 16:12.005
- Yes, I dropped him off
at the Edgewater Beach

16:12.138 --> 16:13.674
to go clamming.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.592
He made me stay
for the first bucket.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.056
He's so thoughtful
that way.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.391
- I'm sure he is.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.805
- Whatever you might
be thinking, Agent Parker,

16:20.938 --> 16:22.269
Conrad's a solid guy.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.684
- Oh, he just couldn't
be involved.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.479
Conrad is the gentlest man
I've ever met.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.645
- Excuse me.
We need to go.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.909
- Thank you.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.368
Okay, you know,
this better be good,

16:38.498 --> 16:41.035
because Marion might have
more to tell me about Conrad.

16:41.167 --> 16:44.034
- Gun trace came in.
Belongs to a guy I know.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.706
Duke Crocker.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.671
- You like him for this?
- I don't like him, period.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.048
Okay, now.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.543
Let's see what
we're smuggling this week.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.965
Hello? Duke!

17:13.282 --> 17:15.694
Duke!

17:19.205 --> 17:21.196
Ugh. He's not here.

17:25.711 --> 17:29.124
Everything about this guy
is a pain in my ass.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.255
- Why?
Because he wasn't home?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.592
- Because he's unreliable,
untrustworthy,

17:34.720 --> 17:35.675
a total waste of—

17:35.805 --> 17:37.796
- Okay, yeah, yeah, I got it.

17:37.932 --> 17:41.595
Wait.
Where are you going?

17:41.727 --> 17:44.264
- To look for Duke
under the usual rocks.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.388
[bell clanging]

17:47.942 --> 17:49.432
[knocking]

17:51.487 --> 17:53.102
- The police were just here
looking for you.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.570
- You shouldn't
be talking to them.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.906
- Conrad, this isn't good.

17:57.034 --> 18:00.993
- Marion, you trust me,
don't you?

18:04.250 --> 18:06.741
- Do you remember
when we were kids?

18:06.877 --> 18:09.414
You taught me how to swim.

18:09.547 --> 18:12.664
You remember how afraid I was
to go under the water?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.381
- You did it eventually.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.047
- Yes,
because I was safe with you.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.514
I have always trusted you.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.507
But this thing with Lester,
I don't know.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.475
- Then let me
handle this myself.

18:28.399 --> 18:33.268
- I'm afraid, Conrad.
- So am I.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.693
[thunder rumbling]

18:41.829 --> 18:45.492
- He hasn't shown up here
either.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.537
Tell Howard that I'll just
touch base with him later.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.500
Perfect. Thank you!

19:08.564 --> 19:11.226
[seagulls squawking]

19:32.838 --> 19:34.624
- Damn it.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.682
You took my clothes.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.824
- Good morning.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.111
- You took my clothes.

20:03.244 --> 20:06.031
- Well, now,
I laundered your clothes.

20:07.123 --> 20:10.081
And I saved your life.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.450
That's an odd combination,
when you think about it.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.871
I mean, if you think about it.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.790
- You must be Duke.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.341
- Milk...

20:28.477 --> 20:30.308
one sugar, right?

20:30.438 --> 20:31.803
- No.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.930
No, and why would you
know how I take my coffee?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.442
- I wouldn't.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.810
But it would have
been cool if I did.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.447
- [scoffs]

20:45.327 --> 20:47.033
Do you know Jonas Lester?

20:47.163 --> 20:49.154
-Hmm.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.782
I know he's dead.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.954
That's it.
Just. . .dead.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.829
- You might want
to rethink your answer.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.877
- Oh. Really?
[clears throat]

21:01.010 --> 21:04.719
- Yeah, your gun
was found where he died.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.303
- Doesn't sound like me.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.549
- Well, you know,
everybody makes mistakes.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.176
- I didn't make that one.
My gun was stolen.

21:12.313 --> 21:13.598
- Okay, so...

21:13.731 --> 21:17.098
of all the guns in the world,
he stole yours.

21:17.234 --> 21:20.146
Yep. That's convenient.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.486
And then you didn't report it,

21:22.615 --> 21:24.651
which is also convenient
andiHegaL

21:24.784 --> 21:26.900
- Well, now, actually,
I did report it.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.448
Nathan didn't mention
that part, did he?

21:32.249 --> 21:34.501
I thought as much.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.992
So are we good?

21:36.128 --> 21:39.586
- Well, if you're telling me
the truth, we might be.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.127
Nathan really doesn't like you.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.215
- Oh, and let me guess
what he said.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.506
Uh...
"He's unreliable,

21:46.639 --> 21:51.008
"dishonest, and a general
pain in the butt."

21:51.143 --> 21:53.350
- Ass.
Yeah, he said "ass."

21:53.479 --> 21:55.765
- Wow. And strangely,
I was going to say that.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.981
I was.
- Was he right?

22:03.823 --> 22:06.986
Is the weather
ever normal here?

22:07.117 --> 22:09.244
- It's, uh...

22:09.370 --> 22:11.531
normal for Maine.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.870
- 'Cause this damage,
this is odd.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.033
And I need to get

22:14.166 --> 22:15.542
a bird's-eye view picture
of this.

22:15.668 --> 22:19.627
Ugh. Oh no. My cell phone.
Oh, crap, it's—

22:19.755 --> 22:21.541
- Oh, yeah. It's toast.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.381
But I, uh...
I got you another one.

22:24.510 --> 22:28.844
- A princess phone?
Seriously?

22:28.973 --> 22:31.680
- You really need to work
on your thank-yous.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.138
[police radio chatter]

22:35.271 --> 22:37.683
[phone ringing]

22:40.568 --> 22:41.899
- I don't care
if he reported it.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.642
It's his gun, and he needs
to explain it to me.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.360
- Well, you know,
you could have told me that

22:45.489 --> 22:46.399
before I talked to him.

22:46.532 --> 22:47.738
The guy's not all bad.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.732
He saved my life,
and then he served me coffee.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.780
- I've known
him since he was 5.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.868
He's all bad.
What's this?

22:53.998 --> 22:55.158
- Instant hail storm.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.998
The fog starts in town
and then heads out to sea.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.288
There's something
strange going on here, right?

23:00.421 --> 23:02.833
- So what?
It's weather. It's weird.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.921
Bangor forensics
restored the paper

23:05.050 --> 23:06.256
we found on Lester's body.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.921
Turns out,
it's from the tide calendar

23:08.053 --> 23:10.009
on Duke's boat.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.380
It's boring,
but it's real evidence.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.632
- Wait. No, no. Wait.
2-5-7-8-9.

23:14.768 --> 23:15.928
What do those numbers mean?

23:16.061 --> 23:17.392
- That's what
I plan on asking him.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.261
You coming?
- No, you go.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.889
I got enough to take care of
between Conrad and the weather.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.061
- Suit yourself.

23:26.572 --> 23:30.030
- So have you managed to turn
your accident into a murder yet?

23:30.159 --> 23:31.399
- Good to see you too, Chief.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.366
- Or are you still wasting
Nathan's time?

23:33.495 --> 23:35.281
- Actually,
I have a few leads,

23:35.414 --> 23:37.245
and your son just linked
the tide calendar

23:37.374 --> 23:39.205
that we found
on Lester's body to—

23:42.129 --> 23:43.460
Tide calendar...

23:43.589 --> 23:46.706
- Oh, your meds just kicked in,
did they?

23:46.842 --> 23:50.960
- Hey, can you go clamming
at Edgewater Beach at high tide?

23:51.096 --> 23:52.927
- Depends on how long
you can hold your breath.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.479
- You lied to me, Conrad.
I know you weren't clamming.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.523
Makes me think you were
up on that cliff with Lester.

24:08.656 --> 24:09.520
- You don't understand.

24:09.657 --> 24:10.863
- No, I understand
you lied to me,

24:10.991 --> 24:12.822
you had Marion lie to me,
you had plenty of reasons

24:12.952 --> 24:14.158
to kill the man who ruined you.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.321
- Respect the perimeter!

24:15.454 --> 24:16.955
- How did you get him so far
from the cliff?

24:17.081 --> 24:19.663
- Please, stay away.
- Agent Parker, leave him alone.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.874
- Get away—
- Tell me! Whoa!

24:32.096 --> 24:33.757
- Stay away from me!
- Marion, listen to me!

24:33.889 --> 24:35.095
- Don't you move!

24:35.224 --> 24:37.306
- It was an accident!
I didn't mean to do it.

24:37.434 --> 24:40.392
- Do what, exactly?
- Kill Jonas Lester!

24:46.151 --> 24:47.652
- What's he doing here?

24:49.321 --> 24:52.028
Never mind.
I can guess.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.237
- What happened to you?

24:53.367 --> 24:54.698
- You won't believe me
when I tell you.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.863
Just let Duke go.
Conrad's our guy.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.453
- Don't think so.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.616
- Did your guy confess?

25:00.749 --> 25:05.539
- Uh...no.
No, he did not.

25:05.671 --> 25:08.037
- Conrad?

25:08.173 --> 25:10.209
Are you saying you did this?

25:10.342 --> 25:12.082
- Yeah, Nathan.
That's what I'm saying.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.510
- Thank you, sir.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.801
Can I go now?
- Sit down.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.052
Conrad, come with me.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.811
- I know you didn't
kill Lester.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.559
- Well, that's fantastic.
I'll buy the first round.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.482
- I also know
that Nathan's right

25:32.614 --> 25:35.151
and that you saw Lester.

25:35.284 --> 25:38.572
- Okay, here's the thing.
I have a rule.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.911
Well, it's more
of a guideline, but...

25:41.040 --> 25:43.577
I don't talk to cops,

25:43.709 --> 25:45.995
even cops that I like.

25:46.128 --> 25:49.291
- I could have a customs agent
assigned to you...

25:49.423 --> 25:50.788
and only you.

25:52.593 --> 25:55.551
What do these
numbers mean?

25:55.679 --> 25:57.635
- Nice photo.

25:58.932 --> 26:04.268
I think an apology from Nathan

26:04.396 --> 26:07.138
might help me remember.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.732
- Fine.
I apologize.

26:14.865 --> 26:16.856
- For?

26:18.118 --> 26:20.200
- Don't push it.
- Look.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.571
Lester wanted me
to run him up to Canada.

26:23.707 --> 26:24.662
- Yeah?

26:24.792 --> 26:27.124
- Yeah, but smuggling
escaped felons

26:27.252 --> 26:28.412
is not on my to-do list.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.126
- All right, the 2-5-7-8.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.632
Is that a partial phone number?
Social Security?

26:32.758 --> 26:35.420
- Lester was looking
for a boat.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.543
Maybe it's
a registration number.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.887
Want to make this easy for me?

26:41.016 --> 26:42.131
- No.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.644
I mean, not particularly.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.136
- Fine. Harbor Master
will tell us the rest.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.139
- Do you mind taking care
of that yourself?

26:50.275 --> 26:52.891
- Are you really buying
this story of Conrad's?

26:53.028 --> 26:54.609
- Nathan,
what happened to Lester,

26:54.738 --> 26:56.069
it happened to me, okay?

26:56.198 --> 26:58.154
He just...
he blew me down the street.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.148
- Blew you down the street?

27:00.285 --> 27:02.241
- Listen, I can't even begin
to explain it, all right?

27:02.371 --> 27:04.327
But it happened,
and it happened to me.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.663
I know
it sounds crazy, but...

27:06.792 --> 27:08.407
I can't even
believe I'm saying it.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.330
- Oh.
I can't believe it either.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.872
- So what
am I supposed to do?

27:12.005 --> 27:13.506
Just pretend that it
didn't happen?

27:13.632 --> 27:14.838
What kind of cop
does that?

27:14.967 --> 27:17.253
- You know how that will sound
on a witness stand.

27:17.386 --> 27:20.002
- Listen, I know that I don't
have it all together,

27:20.139 --> 27:21.504
and I'm just trying
to figure it out.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.971
So I'll go keep working
Conrad's story,

27:23.100 --> 27:24.135
and you check out the docks.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.304
- Excuse me. Uh...

27:26.436 --> 27:29.348
I mean, you guys are
going to let me go first, right?

27:29.481 --> 27:30.857
both: No.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.532
- What's this?

27:42.661 --> 27:46.245
- That is 3,000 square feet
on State Street

27:46.373 --> 27:47.988
in Santa Barbara.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.544
- Oh, my God!

27:54.673 --> 27:56.459
- If we can put
the deposit down,

27:56.592 --> 27:59.174
we could be sipping margaritas
before you know it.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.419
What do you say?
What do you say?

28:07.936 --> 28:11.224
- Yeah, I think
it might be time.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.733
Yeah.

28:20.741 --> 28:24.529
- [sniffing]

28:25.954 --> 28:26.943
[sniffs]

28:35.047 --> 28:36.708
- We gave Nathan that, you know.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.207
- Well, they're
kind of fragrant.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.005
- Not our taste either.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.422
- But when you only have
four senses,

28:43.555 --> 28:45.637
you make the most
of them.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.347
- We have a little present
for you.

28:47.476 --> 28:51.094
- Vince, relax.
It isn't a puppy.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.219
Here.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.729
- This could be
why I thought I recognized you.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.362
- Oh.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.979
- We found that
in our newspaper archives

29:02.115 --> 29:03.901
from 27 years ago.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.161
- Who is she?

29:10.290 --> 29:12.827
- l was hoping
you could tell me.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.951
Do you have family
around here?

29:15.087 --> 29:18.921
- Uh...l don't have family
anywhere.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.462
- Are you still puzzling
over that fog?

29:27.599 --> 29:30.557
- Oh, more than just the fog.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.393
Did Conrad Brower
ever make the paper?

29:33.522 --> 29:35.308
- It's easy enough to check
our archives,

29:35.440 --> 29:37.146
if I can use
your computer there.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.107
- Oh, yeah. Go ahead.

29:46.410 --> 29:47.991
- Wow, that's impressive.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.951
- You should see him use
the Google machine.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.412
- You're hilarious.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.452
Conrad Brower.
Any particular context?

29:54.584 --> 29:56.324
- Weather.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.373
- Oh, | how this girl thinks.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.772
- Nothing much on Conrad,

30:22.904 --> 30:25.361
just the usual
returning war hero piece.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.448
- A beautifully written
war hero piece.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.114
- Obviously, he wrote it.
-Huh

30:32.664 --> 30:34.871
Those weather patterns
of yours turned up, though.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.706
- There's that interview
Harold did

30:36.835 --> 30:39.952
with the Hastings family
in 1956,

30:40.088 --> 30:42.545
right after they moved here
from Calerin, Georgia.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.050
- 1956?

30:44.176 --> 30:47.794
- They were the only survivors
of a freakish series of storms

30:47.929 --> 30:49.590
that destroyed their hometown.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.463
Daughter was a cast-iron bitch.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.511
- Dave!
- Well, she was.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.383
It was a blessing
when she kicked off recently.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.226
- The granddaughter
is lovely, though.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.266
- Guys.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.059
- Well, it must have been
the Caldwell part of the family.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.730
- Caldwell?
Do you mean Marion Caldwell?

31:03.862 --> 31:05.568
both: Yeah.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.107
- I traced that number.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.855
Lester ended up
with another boat.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.029
- What did you find?
- Marion Caldwell's financials.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.948
Lester came back to Haven
for her money,

31:14.081 --> 31:17.619
specifically the $2 million
her mother left her.

31:17.751 --> 31:18.911
- That fits.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.830
We were wrong.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.918
Marion wasn't
protecting Conrad.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.084
Conrad was protecting her
all along.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.253
I think Marion
was on that cliff with him.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.717
- That makes perfect sense.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.927
And Lester had a partner.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.921
He got all this information
about Marion from—

31:33.058 --> 31:34.423
- From Ted.

31:34.559 --> 31:38.472
[phone ringing]

31:38.605 --> 31:39.720
- Hello?

31:39.856 --> 31:41.107
- Marion?
It's Audrey Parker.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.973
- Oh, Agent Parker,
I'm sorry,

31:43.110 --> 31:45.101
but I can't talk right now.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.317
- Okay, Marion, listen to me.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.152
I know you were up on that cliff
with Lester.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.021
- How did you know?

31:50.158 --> 31:51.193
- It doesn't matter.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.237
Lester was after
your inheritance.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.448
- I don't understand.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.833
- Marion,
he was working with Ted.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.291
- What?
No. I don't believe that.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.910
- What were you doing
up there that night?

32:03.046 --> 32:06.630
- I was supposed to go meet Ted
to go star gazing,

32:06.758 --> 32:08.464
but he never showed up.

32:08.593 --> 32:09.708
- Yeah, Ted got you up there,

32:09.845 --> 32:11.460
and Lester was going
to take care of the rest.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.973
- No. No.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.090
- Have you given TED access
to your money lately?

32:18.603 --> 32:19.592
- The deposit.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.981
- Marion?

32:35.287 --> 32:36.447
Marion?

32:38.165 --> 32:40.247
- I have to go.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.490
Now!

32:42.627 --> 32:44.288
- No.
Marion, wait!

32:44.421 --> 32:46.252
Hello?

32:46.381 --> 32:48.337
[wind blowing]

32:48.467 --> 32:50.082
Marion!

32:50.218 --> 32:51.924
Hello?

33:02.564 --> 33:03.804
Nathan?

33:03.940 --> 33:05.680
Marion is going after Ted,
and she doesn't know

33:05.817 --> 33:07.023
what she's capable of.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.484
She could hurt him and a lot
of other innocent people.

33:09.613 --> 33:10.568
- How are you going
to find her?

33:10.697 --> 33:12.233
She could be anywhere.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.775
- I know exactly
where she's going.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.870
- Ted!
- Marion!

33:20.999 --> 33:22.364
- Where are you going?

33:22.501 --> 33:24.617
- Just going
on a small business trip.

33:24.753 --> 33:28.541
- Really? With three bags?
And all my money?

33:28.673 --> 33:30.538
- Marion, it's not
what it looks like!

33:30.675 --> 33:32.666
- It was all lies, wasn't it?

33:32.802 --> 33:34.667
You never loved me!
- Marion, please!

33:34.804 --> 33:36.055
- Don't!

33:50.946 --> 33:53.358
- Marion, I've done nothing
to—to harm you!

33:53.490 --> 33:54.479
- Liar!

33:57.869 --> 34:00.702
- Marion, I'm leaving now.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.539
Marion! I'm sorry!

34:08.672 --> 34:11.038
- You liar!

34:11.174 --> 34:13.256
- Marion.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.377
- This doesn't concern you!

34:16.513 --> 34:20.222
- Look around you, Marion!
All of this is you.

34:35.699 --> 34:36.779
[gunshot]

34:47.752 --> 34:49.617
Marion, listen to me.

34:49.754 --> 34:50.743
You've hurt people,

34:50.880 --> 34:53.132
and you're going to keep
hurting people.

34:53.258 --> 34:57.467
The wind that killed Lester,
the fog, the hail?

34:57.596 --> 35:01.088
All of this,
you're doing this.

35:01.224 --> 35:04.432
You need to make it stop.

35:07.981 --> 35:09.437
Let it go.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.934
Just let it go.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.451
- [sobbing]

35:27.584 --> 35:29.996
- I know. I know.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.369
It's okay.
It's okay.

35:32.505 --> 35:35.497
- [sobbing]

35:52.567 --> 35:54.398
- You should get this car
fixed up.

35:54.527 --> 35:55.607
- [chuckles]

35:55.737 --> 35:57.773
Hertz is gonna
put a hit out on me.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.192
Hey, when you were
up at Tuiw—um...

36:00.325 --> 36:03.613
- Tuwiuwok. It means—
- Haven.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.111
- The full name means
"Haven for God's Orphans."

36:06.247 --> 36:07.703
- Orphans?
- Yeah.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.333
People liked "Haven" better.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.700
- Yeah, I suppose they would.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.498
You know, I know why
you were up there that night.

36:14.631 --> 36:16.713
- To keep an eye
on Marion.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.047
I always have.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.543
I didn't trust Ted
as far as I could throw him.

36:21.680 --> 36:26.219
- Or maybe you just...
loved her?

36:31.022 --> 36:35.436
It's time to step up, Conrad.
- HoW's that?

36:35.568 --> 36:38.480
- I could put her in jail,
but what would that solve?

36:40.490 --> 36:42.822
If Marion lets her emotions
get out of control again,

36:42.951 --> 36:45.533
a lot of people
could get hurt.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.744
Only three of us know
what she can do,

36:47.872 --> 36:52.366
but only one of us has a real
chance of making her happy.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.837
She needs somebody
to keep her safe

36:57.966 --> 37:02.255
but most importantly, calm.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.191
- I should have
listened to you.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.450
- It's okay.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.988
I'm not sure
I would listen to me either.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.410
- I won't make
that mistake again.

37:40.925 --> 37:44.042
Oh. I'm sorry.
The perimeter.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.715
I know.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.867
- Lilies and lilac.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.583
- You're an odd man,
Detective.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.798
HoW's your shoulder?

39:09.931 --> 39:12.798
- It's all right.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.676
- [chuckles]
Oh? Tough guy.

39:17.021 --> 39:20.730
-So...

39:20.859 --> 39:22.565
so you tie up
the loose ends on Lester?

39:22.694 --> 39:24.059
- He and Ted worked it
from the start.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.937
Then Lester got picked up
on a routine parole violation,

39:27.073 --> 39:29.689
then broke out so Ted wouldn't
walk off with his share.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.407
- HoW's Marion doing
with all this?

39:31.536 --> 39:33.072
- She's still grappling
with the idea

39:33.204 --> 39:35.195
that she affects the weather.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.663
- You still believe that?

39:37.792 --> 39:39.999
- And you still don't?

39:41.880 --> 39:44.246
When you've ruled
everything else out,

39:44.382 --> 39:46.498
you have to accept
what's left.

39:46.634 --> 39:50.252
- Guess I'm not ready to rule
everything else out yet.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.048
I know that picture.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.390
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.262
Colorado Kid murder.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.685
Chief was a beat cop
on the case.

40:03.818 --> 40:04.898
He never solved it,

40:05.028 --> 40:07.770
which I try and remind him of
whenever I can.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.113
- The Chief?

40:10.241 --> 40:12.027
You mean your dad?

40:13.953 --> 40:15.944
- I mean the Chief.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.616
Can I see it?

40:37.435 --> 40:38.595
She looks like you.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.144
- Yeah.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.855
Yeah, I know.

40:44.984 --> 40:47.817
- So what do you think?
Is she your mother?

40:47.946 --> 40:49.152
An aunt?

40:49.280 --> 40:53.068
- I really—
I don't know.

40:55.536 --> 40:58.243
You know, every other kid I knew
dreamed that their parents

40:58.373 --> 41:00.113
would come and claim them,

41:00.249 --> 41:02.911
and then they'd turn out
to be rock stars.

41:03.044 --> 41:05.160
But I—
I just dreamed that...

41:08.800 --> 41:10.836
You know, never mind.

41:10.969 --> 41:14.302
- Too late to stop now.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.347
- I dreamed that my mother
would roll up in a big bus,

41:21.479 --> 41:25.017
and she would rescue every kid
in every orphanage in the world

41:25.149 --> 41:26.685
and bring them home.

41:29.445 --> 41:32.357
- Might be a good idea
to let that one go.

41:34.909 --> 41:36.649
- Yeah, well,
I wish I could.

42:00.685 --> 42:03.267
- Howard.
- Hey, boss.

42:03.396 --> 42:06.559
You know that vacation time
I never take?

42:06.691 --> 42:07.806
I need a few weeks.

42:07.942 --> 42:11.855
There's just something
I need to look into.

42:11.988 --> 42:14.650
- No problem.
You deserve it.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.838
She's staying.

42:36.054 --> 42:39.046
Maybe she can help you
with your troubles.

42:55.156 --> 42:58.148
[loud rumbling]
