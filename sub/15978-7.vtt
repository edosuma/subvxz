WEBVTT

00:05.306 --> 00:07.241
I don't know if I'm a bracelet
kind of guy, Ray.

00:07.275 --> 00:10.511
I feel like a bassist
in a Christian rock band.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.413
Trust me.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.448
Ladies love
when you accessorize.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.284
And you picked
a nice one, too.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.586
Definitely the most masculine
one your sister had.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.455
Come on, let's
get out of here

00:21.489 --> 00:22.723
before my mom starts asking
a million questions.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.825
You a grown ass man--
you tell her the truth.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.627
You haven't had sex
since the divorce

00:26.660 --> 00:29.463
and your buddy Ray is taking you
out to get your beak wet.

00:29.497 --> 00:32.466
She's already way too involved
in my eating habits

00:32.500 --> 00:34.102
and my sleeping habits.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.270
I don't need her involved
in my mating habits.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.707
(rock drums playing nearby)

00:42.143 --> 00:44.278
Nathan, do you hear those drums?

00:44.312 --> 00:46.514
That boy next door
is at it again.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.149
I need my pot.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.284
Carol, you hit the pot?!

00:50.318 --> 00:51.585
Oh, yeah.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.454
I hit it. I hit it hard.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.189
It's the only way I can cope

00:55.223 --> 00:57.591
with the noise
coming from next door.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.530
Well, that's disappointing.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.232
Thought I had just found
my new planetarium buddy.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.666
Let's do this, Brandon.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.235
(loud clanging)

01:07.268 --> 01:08.536
Oh, man.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.271
Mom, Mom, that
is not helping.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.606
It sounds like you're calling
in the ranch hands for supper.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.674
(rock drums continue)

01:13.707 --> 01:17.178
Oh, don't you look spiffy
with your man bracelet.

01:17.211 --> 01:20.581
Where are you two headed,
Spain?

01:20.614 --> 01:22.283
No, we're going out

01:22.316 --> 01:23.551
and that's all you need to know.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.319
(rock drums continue)

01:25.353 --> 01:27.555
I can do this all night,
Brandon.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.423
(loud clanging)

01:54.615 --> 01:58.919
Okay, so, Dad, Adam and I will
be back by 11:00 at the latest.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.255
Emergency numbers
are by the phone.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.457
Oh, and remember,
all the cabinets are childproof,

02:03.491 --> 02:06.594
so if you really need something,
Mikayla knows how to open them.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.563
You're acting like
I've never done this before.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.565
No, I'm acting like you have
done this before, Dad.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.267
The last time
you babysat Mikayla,

02:13.301 --> 02:14.935
you let her drive the car.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.872
She beat me in Monopoly
and that was the bet.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.508
Dad, please just keep
my daughter alive

02:20.541 --> 02:21.509
until we get home. Okay?

02:21.542 --> 02:23.877
Adam and I really need
a night to ourselves.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.514
Okay, hon, I'm
ready when you are.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.748
Oh, nice hat.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.717
Are you doing bald or
are you going blind?

02:31.252 --> 02:32.620
Hey, Clark, you're not going
to believe this,

02:32.653 --> 02:34.322
but Superman just left.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.457
Ah... yeah, that's very funny.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.492
I don't think you look
like Clark Kent, honey.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.794
I think you look like the
city's most well-read pimp.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.697
(both laughing)
That was good.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.567
Hey, come on. We always say
it's not mean if it's funny.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.802
No, you always said that
and I always just put on

02:48.836 --> 02:51.705
a big smile to mask my pain.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.174
Let's go to the movies.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.745
Hey, Clark,
if you need to change,

02:57.778 --> 02:59.447
there's a phone booth
on Maple.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.817
What's a pimp?

03:04.852 --> 03:07.855
Oh, well...

03:07.888 --> 03:10.624
Do you know
what a prostitute is?

03:14.562 --> 03:16.564
*

03:18.499 --> 03:19.800
I'm sorry, I don't know
how it got so tangled.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.470
It's just so
crowded in here.

03:23.571 --> 03:27.541
You're not ready
to accessorize, amateur.

03:28.576 --> 03:29.710
Hey, man, your...

03:29.743 --> 03:31.745
Nate, you're not going
to believe this.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.946
Remember earlier
when we were talking about

03:32.980 --> 03:35.449
how much we like the names
Beth and Leah?

03:35.483 --> 03:36.717
Yes.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.586
Look who I met waiting
in line for the bathroom.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.255
She's Beth and I'm Leah.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.891
I'm Beth and she's Leah.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.459
(laughing)

03:45.493 --> 03:47.461
Got it. Yeah, gosh,
what are the chances, huh?

03:47.495 --> 03:50.398
BOTH:
I know.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.433
And the coincidences
don't end there.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.403
Ray told me you ran a 5K
last weekend to fight cancer.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.870
Did you run it, too?

03:56.904 --> 03:59.607
No. But I hate cancer.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.943
No way!
Yes.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.446
It's so bad for you.

04:05.479 --> 04:08.849
It "liter-arily"
does nothing good for the world.

04:08.882 --> 04:12.953
Like, why is it even
a thing? Seriously?!

04:12.986 --> 04:14.722
*
Wait, oh, my gosh, you guys.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.857
I love this song.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.893
Me, too. Are we separated
at birth or something?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.729
I doubt it.
Aren't you black?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.732
Let's dance.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.535
*
Okay,

04:27.568 --> 04:28.669
are we going to
do our routine?

04:28.702 --> 04:31.339
Hey, we didn't watch Magic Mike
12 times for nothing.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.742
*

04:35.943 --> 04:37.378
Break it down.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.380
(grunting)

04:39.413 --> 04:40.681
Why are we leaving
the room?

04:40.714 --> 04:43.617
Turn around,
turn around.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.052
*

04:47.087 --> 04:49.823
And we're back.
We're back.
Yeah.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.329
(quietly):
Okay, it's cool.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.430
I think my roommate's asleep.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.666
Sorry I lost and we had
to come to your apartment.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.734
Shh. That's okay.
That's okay.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.637
Do you and Leah make all your
decisions by leg wrestling?

05:03.671 --> 05:06.807
LEAH AND BETH:
One... two... three...

05:06.840 --> 05:08.909
go!

05:08.942 --> 05:10.411
(woman grunting)

05:10.444 --> 05:11.645
Ow!

05:11.679 --> 05:12.746
Ah, stop it.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.882
Who's winning?

05:14.915 --> 05:17.585
We are.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.819
Let's go upstairs.

05:18.852 --> 05:19.820
Ooh, are you afraid
your roommate

05:19.853 --> 05:22.523
will see us and want to join in?

05:22.556 --> 05:24.525
That's not funny
even as a joke.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.496
(Beth laughing)
So, sorry about this,

05:28.529 --> 05:29.930
it's just your shoes
were very loud.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.832
I love it. I feel like
I'm back in high school

05:31.865 --> 05:35.669
sneaking off to make out
with the vice principal.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.707
Okay.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.878
(Beth laughs)

05:47.681 --> 05:50.751
(all screaming)

05:50.784 --> 05:52.486
What are you doing in here?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.722
I came in here to get
away from the drumming.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.089
I guess I fell asleep.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.092
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were having company.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.496
This is... Leah.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.465
Beth.
Beth.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.400
Short for Lizbethany.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.402
My mother didn't know
whether she should

06:08.436 --> 06:11.038
name me Elizabeth or Stephanie,
so she did both.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.173
I'm Carol. Just Carol.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.642
My mother was Depression era.

06:14.675 --> 06:18.078
They never took more
than they needed.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.080
So, how do you guys
know each other?

06:20.113 --> 06:23.617
Oh, um, well, Carol and I met
in the, um...

06:23.651 --> 06:26.053
in the hospital.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.988
Um...

06:28.021 --> 06:29.690
Carol's... Carol's my mother.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.825
My roommate is my mother.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.727
She moved in after my parents
got divorced.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.195
I hope you got some money, girl.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.764
(laughs)

06:36.797 --> 06:39.433
Well, okay,
you kids have some fun.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.769
Just so you know,
my room is that way.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.938
So anything that this headboard
does against that wall,

06:44.972 --> 06:46.206
is no biggie.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.041
Okay, yeah, thanks.
Good night, Mom.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.743
Thanks. Thanks very much.
Aw...

06:49.777 --> 06:51.512
Your mom seems super nice.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.447
Now, let's see
that ding-dong.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.748
Oh, yeah, you know what?
I'm sorry.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.216
I don't... I don't think
this is going to happen now.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.452
My mom is right
across the hall.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.987
So? You didn't mind when
she was right across the hall

07:00.020 --> 07:02.490
when we first came in here.
What's the diff?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.124
But now she knows
what's going on. It's weird.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.594
Who cares if it's weird?

07:06.627 --> 07:07.861
I'm into weird.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.463
(laughs)

07:11.164 --> 07:12.500
No, you know what, I'm sorry,

07:12.533 --> 07:13.967
it's still warm
from where she was laying.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.603
I'm sorry, I-I can't do this.
You gotta go.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.770
I'm so sorry.
You gotta go right now.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.138
Seriously? Why?

07:18.171 --> 07:19.139
Because the longer we're
in here, the more time we have

07:19.172 --> 07:21.809
to do what it is that
she thinks we're doing.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.644
Mom?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.112
Mom?

07:25.145 --> 07:27.114
Beth's leaving.
She wanted to say good-bye.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.082
Lizbethany's already leaving?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.484
And I didn't even get
to see his ding-dong.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.351
Okay.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.853
Well, I just wanted
to let you know

07:32.886 --> 07:34.755
she's only been here
for a short amount of time

07:34.788 --> 07:37.190
and you'll probably never
see her again.
Hey.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.659
Or you'll see her
all the time.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.960
I mean...

07:39.993 --> 07:41.729
You know, I mean,
I'm obviously serious enough

07:41.762 --> 07:43.631
about her to bring her back
to the house.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.198
Yay.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.034
That, or it'll just be
one of those things

07:47.067 --> 07:48.068
where you go on a few dates
and it doesn't work out.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.203
Or it does. Who know?
But, uh, too early to tell.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.272
All we've done is kiss.
It didn't mean anything.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.874
Or everything.
You know,

07:53.907 --> 07:55.208
who knows?
All right, good night.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.745
(door closes)

08:00.080 --> 08:01.749
He ran her out of
the house so fast

08:01.782 --> 08:03.216
you could hear the
wind whistling

08:03.250 --> 08:04.985
through her
empty little head.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.220
I think Nathan might
be having issues

08:07.254 --> 08:09.823
having sex with me
in the house.

08:09.857 --> 08:10.891
That's the big emergency

08:10.924 --> 08:13.694
I had to drop everything
and meet you here for?

08:13.727 --> 08:16.664
Now I'll never know where those
ants were taking that grape.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.266
This is serious, Tom.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.934
Where did he get
these sexual hang-ups?

08:20.968 --> 08:24.171
When Nathan was a teenager
and you gave him the sex talk,

08:24.204 --> 08:26.239
was he awkward about it?

08:26.273 --> 08:27.608
What sex talk?

08:27.641 --> 08:28.976
Tom, you're kidding.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.811
You never sat Nathan down
and told him

08:30.844 --> 08:32.680
about the birds and the bees?

08:32.713 --> 08:34.214
Well, I was confused.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.817
I thought you just wanted me to
find out if he'd had sex yet.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.251
I asked, he hadn't

08:38.285 --> 08:40.120
so we finished our game
of Connect Four.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.555
He won in four moves.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.623
Went straight up.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.825
I never saw it coming.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.594
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.962
No wonder he's having problems.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.197
Oh, calm down-- it's not like

08:50.230 --> 08:52.032
he didn't figure out
how everything works.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.267
The sex talk
isn't just educational.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.170
It's about creating a dialogue
with your child

08:57.204 --> 08:58.839
so that the subject of sex

08:58.872 --> 09:01.308
isn't taboo
in front of their parents.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.209
What's the big deal?

09:02.242 --> 09:03.711
So what if he doesn't want
to have sex

09:03.744 --> 09:05.178
in front of his mother.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.580
Hell, even when we had sex

09:06.614 --> 09:09.349
I preferred you facing
the other way.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.718
You're not getting it.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.252
We have a problem here, Tom.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.922
If Nathan's not comfortable
bringing women home

09:14.955 --> 09:17.157
with me there, how is he ever
going to find a wife

09:17.190 --> 09:20.327
and give us our grandchildren
Dale and Candace?

09:20.360 --> 09:24.031
He's not naming his kids after
your childhood poodles.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.633
They were springer spaniels.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.301
Get it straight
before you shoot it down.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.703
We need to sit Nathan down

09:29.737 --> 09:32.706
and have an open discussion
about sex.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.108
All right, but you're the
leader of this discussion.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.811
And, uh, remind me,
with the birds and the bees,

09:37.845 --> 09:39.880
which one's got the wiener?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.691
Stop it. No.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.059
No, you are not seriously
going to sit down

09:52.092 --> 09:54.227
and talk about sex
with your 42-year-old son.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.395
Yep.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.797
Oh, this is amazing.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.231
Oh, my God. Oh.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.801
I hope I have enough memory on
my phone to film all this.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.637
Does Nathan know
this is happening?

10:03.671 --> 10:06.139
No. I told Adam to take
Mikayla to a friends'

10:06.173 --> 10:08.275
and Ray is bringing him over.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.744
Debbie, get out while you can.

10:10.778 --> 10:11.745
Remember the drug talk?

10:11.779 --> 10:13.013
Your mother took Ecstasy

10:13.046 --> 10:16.149
to teach you kids about
the dangers of drugs.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.417
She wound up in her underwear

10:17.450 --> 10:21.088
chasing a dog she thought
was Neil Diamond.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.791
I never took drugs.
It was a Tic Tac.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.859
I'm just an incredible actress.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.661
Well, I'm staying.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.897
I wouldn't miss
this for anything.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.765
Miss what?
Nothing.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.801
Just... think I can see better
from over here.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.770
CAROL: Uh,
Nathan, honey,

10:36.804 --> 10:39.139
we'd like to talk to you.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.273
Oh, you know what,
can we do it later?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.209
We're just here to pick up Adam
and go shoot some hoops.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.411
There's not gonna be
any basketball today.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.314
Your family's concerned
about something, and...

10:47.347 --> 10:50.317
we need to talk to you
about a delicate subject.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.720
Okay. Look,
I see what's going on here.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.354
You think I'm on steroids.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.824
I get this all the time.
I-I assure you,

10:56.857 --> 10:58.325
it's just diet and exercise

10:58.358 --> 11:01.228
and clothes that accentuate
that diet and exercise.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.396
He has no idea
what's happening here.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.233
(laughs, clears throat)
Sorry, just go ahead

11:06.266 --> 11:07.835
with your sex talk.
(clears throat)

11:07.868 --> 11:09.236
What?

11:09.269 --> 11:10.704
After the other night,

11:10.738 --> 11:12.806
it's clear you're
uncomfortable around me

11:12.840 --> 11:14.174
when it comes to sex.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.743
TOM:
Your mother is
forcing us all

11:15.776 --> 11:17.845
to have an open,
mature discussion

11:17.878 --> 11:20.781
about our pee-pees
and our hoo-hoos.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.953
In this bag are
a variety of sexual topics.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.956
Each of us will take turns
pulling out a slip of paper

11:28.989 --> 11:31.024
so that no one
has to be embarrassed

11:31.058 --> 11:33.360
about coming up
with a subject on their own.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.897
Well, you guys are all insane,
so that's not happening.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.899
Let's go, Ray.
Sorry about this.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.234
No! We're not
going anywhere.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.937
Your mom just wants you
to be open.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.873
Maybe you should
read him your letter.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.841
You knew about this?

11:47.875 --> 11:49.777
"Dear Nathan...

11:49.810 --> 11:52.112
(crying): "this is
the hardest letter

11:52.145 --> 11:55.315
"I've ever had to write because
you're more than my wingman,

11:55.348 --> 11:58.051
"you're my wings... man.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.990
"But your sexual hang-ups
are affecting me

12:03.023 --> 12:05.225
"in the following ways.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.262
When you sent your date..."

12:10.430 --> 12:13.033
(crying): Can't do it.
I can't do this.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.168
Give it,
give it to me!

12:15.202 --> 12:16.870
(sobbing)

12:18.471 --> 12:20.841
"When you sent your date home
because of your mother,

12:20.874 --> 12:23.376
"she interrupted me
and her roommate, and...

12:23.410 --> 12:26.847
"this girl had a badonk-adonk
that just wouldn't quit.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.951
"When she took off her pants,
her thong looked like

12:30.984 --> 12:34.187
"James Franco's arm
caught between two boulders...

12:35.856 --> 12:39.860
"...and I wanted to be
stuck there for 127 hours.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.494
"Then when I thought
I'd seen it all,

12:41.528 --> 12:43.296
she winked at me with her..."
Oh, my stars.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.867
Well, now this
drawing makes sense.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.101
Um...

12:49.202 --> 12:51.404
Basically, Nathan,
you ruined his night.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.373
Yeah, well, by driving me
here, he's ruined mine.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.208
So we're even, Ray.
I'm walking home.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.244
Good-bye, everybody.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.248
*

13:05.518 --> 13:07.320
We're doing this.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.359
Adam?

13:12.392 --> 13:14.527
Hey, buddy,
the whole family's gone nuts.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.964
You still want
to play some basketball?

13:16.997 --> 13:18.165
Adam?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.333
Adam?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.276
(all panting)

13:29.309 --> 13:31.912
We're doing this.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.447
Fine, I'll give you ten minutes,
but only 'cause I think

13:34.481 --> 13:37.350
all this running around is
gonna give Dad a heart attack.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.519
Thank you.
I think I just saw my dad

13:39.552 --> 13:41.821
calling me from
the end of the sidewalk.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.224
Oh, good, Adam's back,

13:44.257 --> 13:46.927
just in time
to join the game.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.329
I don't mind breaking the ice
and going first.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.232
Let's see which sexual topic
we'll discuss.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.467
Oh, please be hand-holding.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.936
Uh...

13:55.969 --> 13:57.304
"Self-pleasuring."

13:57.337 --> 13:59.372
(others groan)

13:59.406 --> 14:02.910
Okay. Um, uh, I know
that self-pleasuring

14:02.943 --> 14:04.577
is fairly common.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.980
Uh, show of hands?

14:10.984 --> 14:14.187
(laughs):
Okay, uh...

14:14.221 --> 14:17.390
I-I know for me,
I like to close my eyes

14:17.424 --> 14:20.227
and think of Valentine's Day.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.495
Or Josh Groban.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.933
Uh... Ray, do you have
a preferred method?

14:25.966 --> 14:28.335
I usually leave my eyes open
so I can see the movie.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.304
(soft groan)
Oh, boy,
okay, well...

14:31.338 --> 14:33.173
should we move on
to the next topic?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.575
Actually, I'd like to stay
on the topic of pornography.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.345
Oh. Okay, well,
jumping right in.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.615
And what do you like to strum
your banjo to, big fella?

14:42.649 --> 14:45.418
Uh, no, no, no.
Actually, I'm not
really into porn.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.188
Debbie's the banjo strummer
in this family.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.189
What?!
Yeah, that's right.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.191
I know that you rented
all those dirty movies.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.425
The charges were all over
the cable bill.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.427
Adam, I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.363
Really? You don't
remember buying a movie

14:56.396 --> 14:58.231
called Fifty Shades of Fedora?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.467
Ooh, that movie
is hot!

15:00.500 --> 15:01.935
And that's coming from a guy

15:01.969 --> 15:03.937
who's only seen
the first four minutes.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.041
Look, I thought maybe you
had a thing for fedoras.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.243
That's why I bought this
stupid hat in the first place.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.145
But obviously, I am not
fedorable enough for you.

15:12.179 --> 15:16.349
Stop it already. It was me--
I rented Fifty Shades of Fedora.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.051
Well, mystery solved.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.320
And lunch vomited.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.521
Wait, wait, wait
a second, Tom.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.490
You could barely
turn the TV on.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.459
How did you manage to
crack the parental code
and order a movie?

15:26.493 --> 15:29.162
When properly motivated
I can figure things out.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.098
(others groan)

15:31.131 --> 15:32.565
It was research.
I'm single again.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.268
I wanted to see
what people are up to.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.469
Oh, Tom, you'll be fine.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.071
It's like riding a bike.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.372
Well, that's just it,
before Carol,

15:39.406 --> 15:41.441
I'd been on
only two other Schwinns:

15:41.474 --> 15:43.710
Dottie Schwinn
and her cousin Rebecca.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.545
(others groan)

15:45.578 --> 15:47.114
Excuse me?

15:47.147 --> 15:49.116
You were with two other people?

15:49.149 --> 15:51.451
You told me I was your first.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.421
Of course I did-- I was trying
to get in your overalls.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.992
Debbie, I am so sorry.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.628
Can I speak to you
in the kitchen for a second?

16:03.430 --> 16:06.199
Oh, my gosh! We've been
so mad at each other,
Whoa!

16:06.233 --> 16:08.035
we haven't been together
in, like, four days!

16:08.068 --> 16:11.371
(kissing)
I know. If Nathan
pulled one more topic

16:11.404 --> 16:13.006
out of that bag, I
was gonna burst.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.518
"Oral."
Good-bye, everybody.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.189
We're done here.
Nothing wrong with me.

16:29.222 --> 16:32.459
Then why can't you have sex with
someone while I'm in the house?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.561
Uh, 'cause I'm normal.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.296
Normal? Since
I've been living there,

16:36.329 --> 16:38.565
that is the only woman
you've brought home?

16:38.598 --> 16:41.268
You don't know that-- maybe I've
been sneaking 'em in and out.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.503
Impossible. I check on you
several times a night

16:43.536 --> 16:44.571
to make sure you're breathing.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.514
Look at your sister--
she doesn't have any hang-ups.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.549
Yeah, but she's married--
she can do whatever she wants,

16:56.583 --> 16:59.419
and you're not gonna judge her
the same way that you judge me.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.155
Judge you? Nathan, why would
you think I would judge you?

17:02.189 --> 17:05.292
Because I was gonna have
cheap, meaningless sex, and
never see that woman again.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.160
You don't know that.
Love can strike...

17:07.194 --> 17:09.429
There was no love.
We had nothing in common.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.199
Literarily, nothing in common.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.601
Look, Mom, I know how
you feel about sex--

17:14.634 --> 17:16.503
it's between two people
who are in love.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.471
Come on, you've only
had sex with one man

17:18.505 --> 17:20.207
in your whole life.
I respect that.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.209
But sometimes it's
a little hard to live up to

17:22.242 --> 17:23.810
when you're single
and 42 years old.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.449
Thirty-six.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.783
What?

17:30.817 --> 17:32.819
Thirty-six.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.423
Wait, wait a second,
are you telling me

17:36.456 --> 17:39.492
that I'm six years younger
than I think I am? That would...

17:39.526 --> 17:40.793
that would make total sense.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.562
I mean, my skin is so supple.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.831
When I met your father, I lied.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.267
I've slept with 36 people.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.068
Whoa.
What?!

17:50.570 --> 17:52.639
You've had sex with 36 men?

17:52.672 --> 17:55.742
35 men.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.780
It was the '60s--
the only people

18:00.813 --> 18:05.185
who weren't getting it on
were dorks like your father.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.254
I wasn't a dork!

18:07.287 --> 18:11.591
I had a honeybee hive
that demanded all my attention!

18:11.624 --> 18:16.563
M-Mom, you married Dad
when you were 20-- that means...

18:16.596 --> 18:18.365
It was the Summer of Love.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.533
Everyone was having sex
to make a statement,

18:20.567 --> 18:24.137
and I had a lot to say.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.472
You are unbelievable!

18:25.505 --> 18:27.274
What else did you lie about?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.642
Are you actually pleasant
to be around?

18:31.611 --> 18:34.214
I can't believe that all these
years I've been tiptoeing around

18:34.247 --> 18:37.617
the subject of sex only to
find out that Mommy did Dallas.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.489
I didn't plan on sharing
that information, Nathan,

18:42.522 --> 18:44.424
but you had me up
on a moral pedestal,

18:44.457 --> 18:46.526
and if that's where all your
problems were coming from,

18:46.559 --> 18:47.860
you needed to know the truth.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.230
Yeah, well, thanks,
but next time feel free

18:50.263 --> 18:51.531
to lie a little.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.600
I mean, 36 people--
that's enough to field

18:53.633 --> 18:55.868
four different baseball teams!

18:55.902 --> 18:57.670
We could hold a tournament.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.540
I guess we all know
what first prize would be.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.275
Okay, enough.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.678
But... does it help you to know?

19:05.712 --> 19:07.247
(sighs)

19:07.280 --> 19:09.349
I can't believe I'm
saying this, but...

19:09.382 --> 19:10.583
it actually kind of does.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.620
I feel like a big
weight's been

19:13.653 --> 19:15.555
lifted off
my shoulders...

19:15.588 --> 19:18.225
and put right onto Dad.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.293
I should probably
go check on him.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.495
Thirty-six!

19:26.299 --> 19:27.700
Okay, Carol...

19:27.734 --> 19:29.636
let me ask you a question.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.471
We're all being
open and honest.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.705
What's your real number?

19:33.740 --> 19:35.642
One.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.710
I knew it.

19:37.744 --> 19:41.781
Anybody with numbers that high
loses track after 30.

19:43.616 --> 19:47.354
You're not gonna
tell on me, are you?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.988
Nah. You're a good mom.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.359
You're a liar... (laughs)
but you're a good mom.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.261
NATHAN:
Ray,

19:54.294 --> 19:55.962
looks like we're gonna
have some company tonight.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.797
Apparently, I have
some catching up to do.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.700
What do you say, Ray, want
to hit the discoteque with us?

20:00.733 --> 20:01.634
Whoa, Tom.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.570
Slow down.
You don't want to get out there

20:03.603 --> 20:04.637
and look like a
fool now, okay?

20:04.671 --> 20:08.207
Don't worry, Dad,
we'll make sure you look good.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.944
*

20:16.816 --> 20:19.619
I can't believe we
were actually gonna
sleep with those guys.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.588
I know.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.690
I'll, like, wrestle you
for the old dude.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.625
Let's do this.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.460
*

20:27.494 --> 20:29.362
WOMEN:
One, two,

20:29.396 --> 20:31.664
three, go!
(grunting)

20:35.868 --> 20:37.870
*

20:44.877 --> 20:46.313
(Carol panting)

20:49.382 --> 20:51.618
Wrong bag.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.353
You got the wrong bag.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.625
(panting)
Grandma needs the juice.
