WEBVTT

00:32.938 --> 00:34.815
It is time.

00:36.608 --> 00:42.614
They've reached the second crucial
turning point in their destiny.

00:42.781 --> 00:47.328
Their message is about to
reach millions.

00:47.536 --> 00:51.248
But... we will change all that.

00:52.916 --> 00:56.003
When our mission is successful...

00:56.211 --> 01:00.341
...no longer will the world
be dominated...

01:00.549 --> 01:05.804
...by the legacy of these two fools!

01:06.013 --> 01:09.266
No longer will we hear this:

01:09.933 --> 01:11.935
We will stop them now!

01:13.312 --> 01:15.105
Brothers and sisters...

01:16.357 --> 01:18.525
...are we ready?

02:49.700 --> 02:53.495
- Greetings, my excellent pupils.
- Station.

02:53.704 --> 02:57.958
Let's continue our study of the
physics of acoustical reverberation.

02:58.208 --> 03:01.670
Meet today's most non-bogus
guest speakers.

03:01.837 --> 03:03.881
Say hello to Thomas Edison.

03:04.798 --> 03:05.799
Hello there.

03:06.008 --> 03:08.177
To help us on the musical side:

03:08.469 --> 03:10.262
Johann Sebastian Bach.

03:13.557 --> 03:16.560
And Sir James Martin
of Faith No More...

03:17.269 --> 03:21.857
...founder of the Faith No More
Spiritual and Theological Center.

03:23.108 --> 03:27.446
- Station!
- Station!

03:27.655 --> 03:30.574
And a special treat
from the 23rd century:

03:30.866 --> 03:32.534
Miss Ria Paschelle.

03:37.331 --> 03:39.792
Miss Paschelle is
the inventor of the...

03:40.000 --> 03:43.629
...statiophonicoxygeneticamp-
lifiagraphiphonideliverberator.

03:43.837 --> 03:46.757
Hard to imagine the world
without them, isn't it?

03:47.591 --> 03:52.221
Remember, this Friday, Ben Franklin
and Aretha Franklin will be here.

03:52.429 --> 03:57.434
Saturday is the field trip
to Babylonia. And very important:

03:57.685 --> 04:03.023
Do not do your homework without
wearing headphones...

05:00.247 --> 05:03.208
De Nomolos. My old teacher.

05:03.709 --> 05:08.297
Rufus.
My favorite pupil.

05:09.089 --> 05:11.050
- I thought you were...
- Dead?

05:11.675 --> 05:13.177
No.

05:14.011 --> 05:15.971
Just in preparation.

05:18.265 --> 05:22.978
I worked within the system
until I could stand it no longer.

05:23.187 --> 05:24.980
And soon...

05:25.230 --> 05:31.236
...soon the system
will never have existed.

05:32.237 --> 05:35.074
- You won't get away with it.
- Time will tell.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.825
Time has told.

05:37.076 --> 05:42.831
I'll go back and change that,
with the aid of my secret weapons!

05:47.419 --> 05:49.672
How's it going, dudes?

06:08.899 --> 06:13.153
Friends, friends, friends.
These are automatons.

06:13.445 --> 06:17.574
Replicas only.
Furnished with my agenda.

06:18.325 --> 06:20.536
Now, what is your mission?

06:20.786 --> 06:25.833
- First, we totally kill Bill and Ted.
- Then we take over their lives.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.377
Then we utterly destroy them.

06:28.544 --> 06:33.507
At the Battle of the Bands, we give
their speech except totally different.

06:33.799 --> 06:37.678
And thus a new future is born.
A great future.

06:38.095 --> 06:40.305
Don't tell us.
You programmed us.

06:40.514 --> 06:43.267
- He's totally a robot!
- So are you!

06:43.475 --> 06:45.352
We're total metal heads!

06:46.603 --> 06:48.063
Shut up.

06:51.775 --> 06:53.193
Now.

06:54.111 --> 06:56.488
- What is the fuel?
- Fear!

06:56.697 --> 06:59.366
- What is the engine?
- Discipline!

06:59.575 --> 07:01.869
- What is the ideal?
- Order!

07:02.077 --> 07:04.163
And how do we achieve it?

07:13.380 --> 07:15.049
Death to Bill and Ted!

07:18.385 --> 07:21.096
Catch you later, evil dude.

08:03.597 --> 08:06.100
I am Bill S. Preston...

08:06.308 --> 08:08.018
...Esquire!

08:10.437 --> 08:14.358
This is Ted "Theodore" Logan!

08:16.944 --> 08:19.238
On drums and keyboards...

08:19.488 --> 08:23.033
...celebrating their fifth year
in the 20th century...

08:23.242 --> 08:26.328
...the princesses
from medieval England.

08:26.704 --> 08:29.248
Joanna and Elizabeth.

08:30.624 --> 08:31.917
And we are...

08:32.960 --> 08:35.379
...Wyld Stallyns.

08:39.924 --> 08:43.303
You tell me you're
the greatest band, but you stink.

08:44.847 --> 08:47.391
We don't understand it either.

08:47.599 --> 08:49.184
You can't sing.

08:49.393 --> 08:54.106
- The girls can play. But you guys?
- Girls mature faster than guys.

08:54.314 --> 08:56.817
Plus, they started
in the 15th century.

08:57.109 --> 08:58.318
What do you mean?

08:58.527 --> 09:01.822
- They're from medieval England.
- Ted, shut up.

09:02.281 --> 09:04.158
Medieval England, Iowa.

09:04.366 --> 09:08.746
The Battle of the Bands is
the biggest event in the area.

09:08.954 --> 09:11.749
We're talking
about a $25,000 first prize...

09:11.957 --> 09:16.378
...a two-year record deal and exposure
to people in the business.

09:16.628 --> 09:22.426
We're even live on Channel 12. If you
were me, would you put you guys on?

09:22.634 --> 09:23.802
No way.

09:25.137 --> 09:28.891
Since you work for Pretzels 'N' Cheese,
I'll give you a shot.

09:29.099 --> 09:30.768
Excellent!

09:32.770 --> 09:38.150
But last. Midnight.
By that time, everyone will be gone.

09:38.359 --> 09:40.903
That's all right.
We're used to that.

09:41.153 --> 09:44.531
We cleaned out Ted's brother's
junior high dance.

09:44.740 --> 09:48.202
They turned on "La Bamba"
while he was playing his solo.

09:48.410 --> 09:50.204
Shut up, Ted!

09:50.454 --> 09:54.500
Guys, do yourself a favor.
Prepare a little.

09:54.708 --> 09:57.711
Work on your act.
Think of something.

09:57.920 --> 10:01.298
Don't worry.
We won't let you down.

10:05.969 --> 10:10.015
- Dude, we gotta win.
- Then we could propose to the ladies.

10:11.183 --> 10:14.895
We can't raise a family on the
money from Pretzels 'N' Cheese.

10:16.855 --> 10:19.233
I'll tell Missy we're on our way.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.778
Should be a most resplendent
birthday party.

10:24.738 --> 10:27.408
- Shall we, ladies?
- Great, sure.

10:48.012 --> 10:51.390
So you have something
else to celebrate tonight.

10:51.932 --> 10:54.476
We got into the Battle of the Bands.

10:56.854 --> 11:00.190
If we win, I'll totally
pay you back your money.

11:00.649 --> 11:02.443
What if you don't win?

11:04.486 --> 11:08.782
Well, uh, I guess...

11:12.077 --> 11:16.665
- Maybe sell more blood.
- Think about selling the instruments.

11:16.874 --> 11:20.753
Of course, we've always got
a spot for you.

11:21.211 --> 11:25.549
Remember my friend, Colonel Oats
from the Alaskan Military School?

11:30.846 --> 11:32.473
- "How's it going?"
- Yeah.

11:32.681 --> 11:34.558
Splendidly.

11:35.934 --> 11:37.227
Remember...

11:37.436 --> 11:40.022
...it's not too late for you, Ted.

11:46.570 --> 11:48.072
For either of you.

11:49.198 --> 11:51.241
For all four of you.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.085
Fresh fudge.

12:02.336 --> 12:03.754
Hi, Oatsie.

12:05.631 --> 12:06.924
Darling.

12:08.634 --> 12:10.386
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Missy.

12:10.594 --> 12:13.347
Hey, Missy.
I mean, Mom.

12:18.602 --> 12:21.730
I can't believe Missy
divorced your dad...

12:21.939 --> 12:23.565
...and married mine.

12:24.566 --> 12:26.110
Shut up, Ted.

12:31.573 --> 12:34.618
- Your dad looks bad.
- I know.

12:36.537 --> 12:37.746
What's next?

12:37.955 --> 12:42.835
- Maybe she'll marry you.
- Then you'll be your own stepdad.

12:48.632 --> 12:52.219
You probably noticed we haven't
given you our gifts yet.

12:52.428 --> 12:54.138
That's because...

12:59.810 --> 13:02.813
That's because we wanted to say...

13:11.238 --> 13:12.489
Excuse us, dude.

13:22.124 --> 13:23.751
I wrote this myself.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.045
I wrote this last night.

13:31.216 --> 13:32.217
"Elizabeth..."

13:32.426 --> 13:33.427
"Joanna...

13:35.179 --> 13:38.640
...as I wander through this dark
and Ionely forest of life..."

13:38.849 --> 13:41.185
"...surrounded by various beasts..."

13:41.393 --> 13:44.480
"...bears, vipers, squirrels..."

13:44.688 --> 13:47.191
"Not to mention barnacles
and algae..."

13:48.067 --> 13:51.487
"...man-of-wars, starfish,
blowfish, catfish..."

13:52.029 --> 13:53.864
Oh, no, that's freshwater.

13:54.865 --> 13:59.078
The point is, I know we promised you
a better life than this.

14:00.454 --> 14:05.375
What I mean to say is, I realize
when we took you out of England...

14:05.542 --> 14:09.004
...we said the future held
some really good stuff.

14:09.213 --> 14:12.383
Although stuff hasn't
worked out how we thought...

14:13.050 --> 14:16.011
...it will, we hope.

14:17.554 --> 14:20.099
The day after tomorrow,
if things work out...

14:20.808 --> 14:22.893
What this is about is...

14:30.901 --> 14:32.611
- Will you...?
- Marry us?

14:39.576 --> 14:41.370
- Theodore...
- I'd love to.

15:22.745 --> 15:27.499
- Aim for the cat, dude!
- I'm trying, Evil Ted! I'm trying!

15:32.296 --> 15:34.048
Aw, just missed!

15:44.224 --> 15:48.479
- Not bad.
- Yeah, let's make it bad.

15:59.656 --> 16:01.116
We're here, dude.

16:02.159 --> 16:03.452
Is Rufus with you?

16:04.787 --> 16:05.829
One second.

16:17.466 --> 16:21.428
Looks like we lost him in the
circuits of time, duder.

16:21.637 --> 16:24.973
Good.
Then he's gone forever.

16:25.140 --> 16:28.560
Our first act of business:

16:28.769 --> 16:31.980
Destroy that ridiculous,
insipid band!

16:32.648 --> 16:34.483
You got it, dude!

16:35.401 --> 16:36.652
Get to work.

16:38.654 --> 16:39.613
Now!

16:39.822 --> 16:41.532
Study these books well.

16:41.699 --> 16:44.326
When my mission is completed...

16:44.535 --> 16:47.287
...this will be the new history.

16:48.747 --> 16:50.249
What a shithead.

16:54.336 --> 16:57.297
- Bye!
- Bye!

16:58.465 --> 16:59.967
Drive safe!

17:01.468 --> 17:02.469
- Dude.
- What?

17:02.678 --> 17:06.140
After we're married,
will the girls stay with us?

17:06.348 --> 17:09.268
Yeah, our girlfriends are
most chaste.

17:09.643 --> 17:13.480
- At least they're not dating our dads.
- Good point, dude.

17:18.777 --> 17:21.363
- Hello?
- This is Joanna.

17:21.571 --> 17:24.616
Joanna! How'd you call so fast?

17:24.825 --> 17:26.910
It's not important. This is:

17:27.161 --> 17:31.415
Elizabeth and I have decided
we're quitting Wyld Stallyns.

17:31.582 --> 17:32.583
What?

17:32.791 --> 17:33.959
- Yes!
- Why?

17:34.168 --> 17:37.129
You're losers and
we don't want to see you again.

17:37.296 --> 17:38.297
No way!

17:38.464 --> 17:44.470
We're going to the desert to be alone.
It's over. Goodbye.

17:51.477 --> 17:56.190
- I totally fooled them.
- Yeah, they're completely brilliant.

17:56.398 --> 17:57.441
Not!

17:58.567 --> 18:01.487
- Let's start phase two.
- Station.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.351
<i>An incredible fortune in stones.</i>

18:33.936 --> 18:36.939
<i>Yet I'd trade them all</i>
<i>for a hand phaser.</i>

18:38.315 --> 18:40.526
<i>Or a good solid club.</i>

18:41.443 --> 18:44.947
Maybe we should've proposed
to them sooner.

18:46.907 --> 18:48.909
How could we, Ted?

18:49.118 --> 18:51.620
We could barely afford
our own apartment.

18:52.329 --> 18:56.166
This is most non-non-heinous.

18:56.708 --> 18:59.878
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta find them.

19:00.129 --> 19:01.338
Talk to them.

19:02.297 --> 19:03.257
But how?

19:22.818 --> 19:25.029
Who could that be?

19:32.202 --> 19:34.621
How's it going, Bill and Ted?

19:34.997 --> 19:37.416
Ted, it's us again.

19:38.208 --> 19:41.337
- How's it going, Bill?
- Not bad, Bill. And you?

19:41.462 --> 19:42.504
Bad.

19:43.630 --> 19:48.594
We came to help in your most
unfortunate situation.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.603
How?

19:57.811 --> 19:59.897
Come with us. We'll show you.

20:02.107 --> 20:03.484
Excuse us.

20:07.112 --> 20:10.240
- I got a weird feeling here.
- Why?

20:10.783 --> 20:12.076
I don't know.

20:12.993 --> 20:15.954
How do we know they're really us?

20:20.375 --> 20:22.336
We've been through this before.

20:22.503 --> 20:25.339
Without the intervention
of our future selves...

20:25.506 --> 20:29.426
...would we have passed history?
Or met the babes?

20:30.010 --> 20:33.514
Or had a most excellent adventure
through time?

20:38.102 --> 20:42.523
Ted, if you're really me,
how many fingers am I gonna hold up?

20:42.731 --> 20:43.732
Three.

20:46.235 --> 20:47.986
You're right!

20:49.697 --> 20:51.699
Let's go, guys.
We'll drive.

20:57.705 --> 20:59.206
- Ted.
- What?

20:59.456 --> 21:04.211
I think we're about to embark
on an unprecedented expedition.

21:06.296 --> 21:07.798
- Dude.
- What?

21:09.174 --> 21:12.136
I got a full-on robot chubby.

21:13.095 --> 21:14.513
Later, Evil Ted.

21:15.014 --> 21:16.265
Later.

21:30.946 --> 21:32.239
I'm cold.

21:34.700 --> 21:37.453
Hey! Can we have some heat back here?

21:37.661 --> 21:39.163
Shut up, Bill.

21:41.498 --> 21:43.709
That other you's a real jerk.

21:43.917 --> 21:49.715
I'll be more considerate to myself
when I become him.

21:49.923 --> 21:52.009
He said, shut your holes!

21:54.928 --> 21:57.014
I got a very bad feeling.

22:31.090 --> 22:32.216
Out.

22:39.723 --> 22:43.227
So where are Joanna and Elizabeth?

22:43.644 --> 22:45.187
They're not here.

22:45.354 --> 22:49.608
We lied. Here's the truth,
we're gonna kill you now.

22:50.818 --> 22:52.736
- No way!
- Yes way, Ted.

22:53.237 --> 22:57.491
- We're programmed to do it.
- And we want to do it too.

22:58.242 --> 23:00.160
You dick, Bill!

23:04.456 --> 23:08.419
- You're metal, dude!
- I know. Check it out.

23:18.721 --> 23:19.722
Let's go.

23:20.431 --> 23:21.932
Bogus.

23:58.177 --> 23:59.636
We gotta do something.

24:00.220 --> 24:03.807
Dudes, even though
you're doing this...

24:04.016 --> 24:07.394
...we, we...

24:07.603 --> 24:09.146
We love you.

24:09.396 --> 24:11.106
We love you.

24:13.359 --> 24:14.777
Fags!

24:19.907 --> 24:23.118
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

24:40.677 --> 24:44.723
Yes! I totally loogied on that
good dead me!

24:46.266 --> 24:49.812
- We're fully, full-on evil robots.
- Yeah!

24:54.817 --> 24:57.528
- You wanna take the van?
- No, it's beat.

25:00.197 --> 25:01.407
There's a Porsche.

25:03.409 --> 25:04.493
Let's bag it.

25:06.328 --> 25:07.830
Station.

25:46.368 --> 25:47.369
Bill...

25:48.912 --> 25:50.289
...what happened?

25:51.957 --> 25:52.916
Ted...

25:54.251 --> 25:56.253
...we're dead, dude.

25:59.465 --> 26:03.260
- No way.
- Yes way.

26:03.469 --> 26:04.887
Look.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.312
Now what?

26:17.232 --> 26:18.567
Who's that?

26:28.994 --> 26:30.788
Who are you?

26:31.455 --> 26:32.498
Ted...

26:33.582 --> 26:36.210
...it's the Grim Reaper, dude.

26:39.004 --> 26:40.798
How's it hanging, Death?

26:41.757 --> 26:44.426
You will come with me.

26:47.429 --> 26:50.641
We can't.
We gotta get back to the babes.

26:50.849 --> 26:53.310
Ted, we can't. We're dead, dude.

26:53.519 --> 26:57.106
We gotta stop these evil "usses."
We gotta try.

26:59.066 --> 27:02.277
Excuse us, dude,
but is there any way back?

27:04.697 --> 27:07.699
You may challenge me to a contest.

27:08.242 --> 27:09.910
But if you lose...

27:10.703 --> 27:13.664
...you will remain here
in the afterlife...

27:14.164 --> 27:15.624
...forever.

27:20.295 --> 27:22.423
What if we win?

27:23.507 --> 27:27.177
No one has ever won.

27:28.429 --> 27:31.932
- Dude, we gotta ditch this guy.
- Definitely.

27:32.474 --> 27:33.600
But how?

27:36.311 --> 27:38.814
Melvin.

27:42.151 --> 27:44.653
Excuse us, dude...

27:44.820 --> 27:47.489
...but your shoes are untied.

27:57.916 --> 28:01.170
I can't believe
we just melvined Death.

28:03.756 --> 28:06.467
Let's hope he doesn't
catch up with us.

28:47.716 --> 28:49.176
No way!

28:52.680 --> 28:53.764
This isn't funny.

28:53.973 --> 28:55.474
Way to go, Joanna!

28:55.724 --> 28:58.394
I don't understand
what's come over you two.

28:58.602 --> 29:02.523
You see, we used to be puss-weeds,
but now we're metal.

29:02.731 --> 29:05.109
So get over here and put out!

29:06.735 --> 29:09.905
You can forget
about us playing tonight.

29:10.781 --> 29:11.782
Fine.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.790
Then I guess that's that.

29:21.917 --> 29:24.002
Yeah, see you.

29:36.598 --> 29:38.684
Catch you later, babes!

29:48.193 --> 29:50.404
Ted, I have an idea.

29:50.612 --> 29:53.490
Tonight after we make
De Nomolos' speech...

29:54.241 --> 29:56.243
...let's waste them.

29:56.952 --> 30:01.248
Station. Meanwhile, let's trash
this lame rathole.

30:01.457 --> 30:02.916
Stellar, Evil Ted!

30:09.506 --> 30:14.094
- Ted, we have got to stop them.
- Yeah. But how?

30:18.474 --> 30:19.850
I hope this works.

30:20.017 --> 30:23.479
<i>It worked in The Exorcist.</i>
<i>I and III!</i>

30:28.609 --> 30:33.781
You'll move downtown so DeLoach
can take her maternity leave.

30:33.989 --> 30:37.242
Also, anyone interested
in moonlighting...

30:37.451 --> 30:40.913
...we're stepping up security
for the Battle of the Bands.

30:41.121 --> 30:44.416
I hear your son's band is playing.

30:46.960 --> 30:51.215
Thanks for reminding me, sergeant.
Also, Scott Frank...

30:51.548 --> 30:55.928
- So, how do we do this?
- I don't know.

30:57.346 --> 30:59.390
Why don't you try something?

31:00.599 --> 31:01.725
Okay.

31:19.326 --> 31:21.411
Okay, dudes.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.456
I mean, fellow policemen...

31:24.999 --> 31:27.668
...my son, Ted "Theodore" Logan...

31:27.876 --> 31:30.462
...and his friend
Bill Preston, Esquire...

31:30.671 --> 31:35.134
...have been murdered and replaced
by evil robots from the future.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.052
You totally did it, dude!

31:37.219 --> 31:39.179
I totally possessed my dad.

31:44.309 --> 31:45.477
Okay.

31:46.228 --> 31:51.275
You have to arrest these robots
so they don't ruin everything for us.

31:51.525 --> 31:54.069
I mean, my son and Bill.

31:54.611 --> 31:58.949
And, most importantly,
they don't hurt the babes.

32:00.033 --> 32:01.577
The princesses.

32:04.037 --> 32:05.164
This isn't working.

32:05.372 --> 32:08.000
- Back me up, dude.
- You got it, dude.

32:20.095 --> 32:22.806
I totally believe you, dude.

32:25.350 --> 32:28.771
- Doughnuts!
- Excellent!

32:28.937 --> 32:30.606
Savory cruller.

32:31.231 --> 32:34.735
- I got really hungry being dead.
- Yeah!

32:36.737 --> 32:39.198
I don't think they believe us.

32:40.157 --> 32:43.077
We have to find someone who will.

32:43.911 --> 32:46.580
Catch you later, cop dudes!

32:52.711 --> 32:55.923
Ted, we can't go like this.

33:07.559 --> 33:09.561
Thanks, Dad.

33:11.563 --> 33:15.317
- Good morning.
- Sergeant.

33:20.656 --> 33:21.865
Gandhi.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.494
Anne Boleyn.

33:26.495 --> 33:28.038
Aristotle.

33:28.747 --> 33:31.583
President Chester A. Arthur.

33:33.043 --> 33:34.878
Clark Gable.

33:35.587 --> 33:37.172
Charlemagne.

33:37.673 --> 33:40.592
And I would like to contact Ty Cobb.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.935
- Has this séance stuff ever worked?
- No.

33:51.478 --> 33:53.772
But it will today, dude.

34:01.280 --> 34:04.450
O great spirits
from the netherworld...

34:04.616 --> 34:08.579
...leave your celestial
abode and speak upon us...

34:08.786 --> 34:11.998
...with your life lessons.

34:22.676 --> 34:25.012
I feel the spirits have arrived!

34:25.179 --> 34:27.097
How's it going...

34:27.306 --> 34:30.184
...New Age dudes?

34:30.893 --> 34:33.896
Spirits, can you hear me?

34:36.982 --> 34:39.275
And we can see down your...

34:39.485 --> 34:42.321
It's your mom, dude!

34:44.156 --> 34:47.326
You're right! Move over, dude.

34:48.577 --> 34:51.789
Spirits, what have you to say to us?

34:52.956 --> 34:56.668
The princesses are in trouble.

34:57.669 --> 35:01.298
Ted and his most
excellent friend Bill...

35:01.507 --> 35:03.258
...were killed!

35:04.760 --> 35:08.388
- Listen to us.
- Beware!

35:12.977 --> 35:15.312
O evil spirits from Hell...

35:15.520 --> 35:18.690
...I send you back into the darkness!

35:22.069 --> 35:26.490
- What's she doing?
- I don't know, but it's not good.

35:30.077 --> 35:31.620
No way!

36:28.177 --> 36:30.971
This is a totally deep hole.

36:34.224 --> 36:37.394
- Now what?
- I don't know.

36:51.200 --> 36:55.704
- You wanna play 20 Questions?
- Okay. I got one.

36:56.163 --> 36:57.706
Are you a mineral?

37:00.334 --> 37:02.169
Are you a tank?

37:03.545 --> 37:04.838
Good one!

37:08.884 --> 37:12.054
- Not bad!
- Can we do it again?

37:13.013 --> 37:17.476
I'm working as hard as I can!

37:17.726 --> 37:19.687
No way!

37:23.690 --> 37:27.653
This is not what I expected
this place to look like.

37:27.945 --> 37:31.740
We got totally lied to
by our album covers, man.

37:44.461 --> 37:46.046
Who's that?

37:46.422 --> 37:49.800
Ted, who do you think it is, dude?

37:54.555 --> 37:56.640
How do we get his attention?

37:57.558 --> 37:59.309
Sign of the devil, dude!

37:59.893 --> 38:03.772
- Hey, Devil dude!
- Down here!

38:03.939 --> 38:06.191
Down here, dude!

38:06.400 --> 38:09.236
Two little guys!

38:09.403 --> 38:11.488
Big dude! Down here!

38:24.209 --> 38:26.086
I kind of like this.

38:28.130 --> 38:29.840
Excellent!

38:31.842 --> 38:33.760
Let's get out of here.

38:39.600 --> 38:43.895
Ted, if I die, you can have
my Megadeth collection.

38:44.062 --> 38:46.523
But, dude, we're already dead!

38:47.816 --> 38:51.904
- Well, then they're yours, dude.
- Whoa! Thanks, dude.

39:12.675 --> 39:14.843
How's it going, Beelzebub?

39:16.929 --> 39:19.264
Okay. Can we go now?

39:20.057 --> 39:22.559
You may go.

39:26.563 --> 39:28.107
Thanks, dude!

39:28.315 --> 39:33.070
You know, you got a bad rap,
but you're actually an okay dude!

39:46.875 --> 39:50.212
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

39:51.839 --> 39:54.842
Maybe we should try
one of these tunnels.

40:02.725 --> 40:05.352
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

40:06.145 --> 40:08.814
Maybe we should try
one of these doors.

40:14.278 --> 40:16.238
After you, dude.

40:24.246 --> 40:25.998
Now where are we?

40:29.251 --> 40:30.335
Who's that?

40:35.132 --> 40:36.425
It's Colonel Oats!

40:37.134 --> 40:38.761
No way!

40:39.136 --> 40:40.846
Gentlemen!

40:42.764 --> 40:45.559
Welcome to Hell.

40:45.809 --> 40:48.270
- No way.
- What?!

40:48.437 --> 40:50.063
No way, sir?

40:50.230 --> 40:52.066
You two...

40:53.192 --> 40:56.779
...will do whatever
I tell you to do...

40:57.029 --> 40:59.907
...from now on.

41:00.115 --> 41:02.451
Is that clear?

41:03.535 --> 41:06.830
- Yes, sir, dude!
- What?!

41:07.414 --> 41:10.334
- Yes, dude, sir!
- What?!

41:10.918 --> 41:12.753
Yes, sir, sir dude!

41:12.920 --> 41:15.756
Get down and give me...

41:15.964 --> 41:18.133
...infinity.

41:21.345 --> 41:25.641
Stupid, pathetic,
craven little cretins.

41:26.809 --> 41:32.105
- I can't possibly do infinity pushups!
- Pitiful little morons.

41:32.439 --> 41:35.025
- Maybe we can do girls' style.
- Jokers!

41:35.234 --> 41:39.697
You petty, base, bully,
bullock, bugger billies.

41:39.863 --> 41:43.659
You're not strong! You're silky boys!

41:44.159 --> 41:48.330
Silk comes from the butts
of Chinese worms.

41:48.497 --> 41:53.752
- We gotta get out of here.
- I'll eat you up like butter cakes.

41:53.961 --> 41:56.380
Get back here!

42:00.259 --> 42:01.927
- Dude.
- What?

42:02.177 --> 42:04.888
I think we're in
our own personal hell.

42:05.055 --> 42:09.184
- Let's split up.
- That way he can't get us so bad.

42:29.580 --> 42:31.540
What happened?

42:58.484 --> 43:00.319
Bogus!

43:27.679 --> 43:32.351
Granny S. Preston, Esquire.

43:32.601 --> 43:34.061
No way.

43:44.446 --> 43:45.489
Theodore!

43:47.574 --> 43:49.493
You made your brother cry.

43:50.244 --> 43:51.662
How about...

43:52.079 --> 43:53.706
...a kiss...

43:54.290 --> 43:58.836
...for your dear old granny, Bill?

44:05.759 --> 44:07.135
Come along.

44:14.977 --> 44:17.813
You stole Deacon's Easter basket.

44:18.021 --> 44:21.525
No way. This was 10 years ago!

44:30.409 --> 44:31.410
Come here!

44:36.165 --> 44:40.043
That was non, non, non...
Non-heinous!

44:40.252 --> 44:41.587
Choose...

44:41.795 --> 44:43.047
...your...

44:43.255 --> 44:45.341
...eternity.

44:48.761 --> 44:52.055
Choose your own, you fag!

45:00.856 --> 45:05.694
You ugly, red source of all evil!

45:12.659 --> 45:15.371
Hello, girls.

45:25.005 --> 45:26.173
- Dude.
- What?

45:26.298 --> 45:28.509
- Hell sucks!
- Definitely!

45:28.717 --> 45:33.430
- You no-nosed salamanders!
- Deac's Easter basket!

45:37.101 --> 45:38.435
Come to Oatsie!

45:42.898 --> 45:45.067
I want one right on the lips!

45:46.360 --> 45:51.657
- There's only one way out!
- Right. We gotta play the Reaper!

45:58.330 --> 46:00.916
Choose your game.

46:01.416 --> 46:03.669
But if you lose...

46:03.919 --> 46:06.588
...you will stay here in Hell...

46:07.381 --> 46:09.133
...forever.

46:25.941 --> 46:28.319
D-1.

46:32.948 --> 46:33.949
Miss.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.460
B...

46:44.710 --> 46:45.878
...3.

46:47.296 --> 46:49.006
Miss.

46:50.758 --> 46:53.385
C-6.

46:57.806 --> 46:58.974
Hit.

47:02.853 --> 47:05.647
- Dude...
- I know.

47:12.446 --> 47:14.781
J-7.

47:15.866 --> 47:17.951
J-7...

47:19.536 --> 47:20.537
Hit.

47:22.331 --> 47:26.335
A hit. You have sunk my battleship.

47:27.044 --> 47:28.086
Excellent!

47:30.506 --> 47:33.676
- I knew he put it in the J's.
- Good thinking.

47:33.884 --> 47:35.886
You must play me again.

47:36.512 --> 47:40.557
- What?!
- Best two out of three.

47:40.766 --> 47:41.975
No way!

47:45.854 --> 47:47.731
Yes way.

47:56.323 --> 47:58.450
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

48:09.169 --> 48:11.296
I believe...

48:11.463 --> 48:15.592
...Col. Mustard did it
in the study with the candlestick.

48:23.892 --> 48:27.146
Sorry, Death. You lose.
It was Professor Plum.

48:27.354 --> 48:31.358
- I said "Plum."
- No way. You said "Mustard!"

48:31.567 --> 48:32.901
Can we go back now?

48:35.279 --> 48:36.947
Best three out of five.

48:38.073 --> 48:40.367
I don't believe this guy.

48:52.296 --> 48:54.798
- Best of seven?
- Damn right!

48:59.678 --> 49:01.680
Right hand, green.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.604
Left hand, red.

49:12.941 --> 49:15.110
Right foot, green.

49:15.778 --> 49:17.238
Right foot...

49:43.597 --> 49:44.765
Well?

49:49.937 --> 49:51.355
I will...

49:53.232 --> 49:54.817
...take you back.

50:02.074 --> 50:06.829
- You played very well.
- Especially with your heavy robes.

50:07.037 --> 50:08.831
Don't patronize me.

50:09.039 --> 50:13.293
Whatever. You got a lot
to learn about sportsmanship.

50:14.419 --> 50:15.921
This way.

50:17.047 --> 50:18.924
Now we can save the babes.

50:19.133 --> 50:23.178
But, Bill, how will we fight
those other usses?

50:23.387 --> 50:27.432
They're totally stronger than us.
And way smarter.

50:27.641 --> 50:30.561
Plus, they already killed us once.

50:32.062 --> 50:33.856
One minute, duder!

50:34.231 --> 50:39.528
If we were good human usses and we had
to fight two evil robot usses...

50:39.737 --> 50:43.282
...what would we do?
- Make good robot usses?

50:43.490 --> 50:45.993
Good thinking, dude!

50:46.368 --> 50:47.411
Excuse us.

50:47.744 --> 50:50.456
- Excuse me, Death?
- Oh, now what?

50:50.622 --> 50:53.959
Could you take us to someone
who could help us?

50:54.168 --> 50:57.588
You have beaten me.
I am at your command.

50:57.838 --> 50:59.089
Cool!

50:59.256 --> 51:00.924
This way.

51:02.468 --> 51:04.219
- Ted.
- What?

51:04.428 --> 51:06.430
Don't fear the Reaper.

51:07.473 --> 51:09.475
I heard that.

51:21.987 --> 51:24.823
This is most atypical.

51:49.348 --> 51:51.016
Welcome to Heaven.

51:53.268 --> 51:55.229
I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

51:55.896 --> 51:57.189
Thank you.

51:59.358 --> 52:00.567
Through there.

52:00.776 --> 52:02.403
Welcome to Heaven.

52:03.612 --> 52:05.656
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

52:07.032 --> 52:11.578
"Only the most serene and enlightened
souls shall gain audience."

52:11.787 --> 52:13.831
Dude, we're in big trouble.

52:16.291 --> 52:18.335
I think I have an idea.

52:27.302 --> 52:29.012
Wise dudes.

52:29.346 --> 52:31.390
Can we ask you a question?

52:31.974 --> 52:33.809
Right this way, please.

52:44.570 --> 52:48.198
We're in Heaven,
and we just mugged three people.

52:48.407 --> 52:51.660
We better leave
before we ruin it for everybody.

52:54.621 --> 52:56.498
Come on, Death.

52:57.374 --> 52:59.376
You look great, dude.

53:00.669 --> 53:02.254
You think so?

53:07.259 --> 53:08.761
You do.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.348
Shut up.

53:14.391 --> 53:16.935
- Come on, dude.
- It's not funny.

53:17.728 --> 53:20.105
I can't believe I'm doing this.

53:20.314 --> 53:23.317
How did I end up in this situation?

53:42.961 --> 53:44.171
How's it going?

53:45.797 --> 53:47.800
What is the meaning of life?

53:57.935 --> 54:02.022
<i>Every rose has its thorn</i>

54:02.272 --> 54:06.360
<i>Just like every night has its dawn</i>

54:06.568 --> 54:09.571
<i>Just like every cowboy</i>

54:09.738 --> 54:13.992
<i>Sings a sad, sad song</i>

54:18.997 --> 54:22.209
<i>Every rose has a thorn</i>

54:24.628 --> 54:26.088
Don't I know you?

54:27.840 --> 54:29.049
No.

55:11.175 --> 55:14.928
So, God, as if you didn't know...

55:15.512 --> 55:20.100
...we're not the three wise people
you might have thought we were.

55:20.309 --> 55:24.688
We mugged three people and took
their clothes. Sorry.

55:24.896 --> 55:28.525
- I'm Bill S. Preston.
- I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

55:28.734 --> 55:33.405
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

55:35.240 --> 55:37.868
This lovely lady is the Grim Reaper.

55:38.077 --> 55:41.330
He brought us when we
challenged him and won.

55:43.707 --> 55:48.754
First, congratulations on Earth!
It's a most excellent planet.

55:48.962 --> 55:53.842
- We enjoy it on a daily basis.
- Not to mention your other planets.

55:54.051 --> 55:58.013
Mars, Jupiter, Uranus.

56:00.474 --> 56:04.103
But the point is, we died.

56:04.311 --> 56:06.772
Most unfairly.

56:07.356 --> 56:09.983
But we won the chance to come back.

56:10.192 --> 56:14.029
We gotta construct something
to save the women we love.

56:14.696 --> 56:18.242
And there's not a lot of time.
So we were wondering...

56:18.492 --> 56:21.954
...could you help us
find somebody to help us?

56:22.705 --> 56:25.124
<i>Station.</i>

56:25.582 --> 56:28.252
We were thinking along the lines...

56:28.419 --> 56:31.713
...of maybe a scientist or something.

56:45.227 --> 56:46.604
Cool.

56:49.856 --> 56:51.650
Thanks, God.

56:51.942 --> 56:55.779
Yeah. You're a just and noble creator.

56:57.114 --> 57:00.659
- We'll be going now.
- Keep up the good work.

57:00.868 --> 57:02.911
Catch you later, God.

57:13.213 --> 57:17.051
Sorry. They melvined me.

57:22.890 --> 57:25.934
All right, upside-down cake!

57:26.101 --> 57:28.896
- Hey, Evil Ted.
- What?

57:34.151 --> 57:35.945
We're out of dishes.

57:37.446 --> 57:39.406
Check this out.

57:42.784 --> 57:45.329
Not bad, E.T.

57:47.498 --> 57:48.749
Let me try.

57:55.672 --> 57:58.217
You totally didn't see the fan.

58:03.305 --> 58:06.558
Tell my body to get over here
and get me!

58:07.017 --> 58:09.937
That's all right. I'll get you.

58:11.521 --> 58:13.982
Got your head, dude.

58:16.777 --> 58:19.530
I'm totally gonna tackle you, dude.

58:22.825 --> 58:27.663
- Touchdown for Evil Ted!
- We're total headbangers.

58:30.916 --> 58:34.253
Come on. There you go.

58:40.175 --> 58:44.096
Stop wasting time.
Proceed with the plan now.

58:44.346 --> 58:46.056
<i>Okay, dude.</i>

58:47.015 --> 58:50.394
<i>What do you say</i>
<i>we trash their relationships?</i>

58:53.063 --> 58:54.648
I hate them.

58:54.857 --> 58:58.027
I hate the robot versions of them.

58:58.485 --> 59:00.404
<i>You made us, dude.</i>

59:07.536 --> 59:09.913
Looks like this is the place.

59:10.164 --> 59:13.041
Now all we gotta do
is find that scientist.

59:14.126 --> 59:17.671
- What kind of name is Station?
- I don't know.

59:17.880 --> 59:20.257
Must be some kind of future guy.

59:25.929 --> 59:27.931
Okay, how many syllables?

59:30.100 --> 59:32.394
Is it a play or a song or...?

59:34.646 --> 59:36.064
It's something big.

59:37.691 --> 59:39.943
My money's on Einstein.

59:42.696 --> 59:44.239
That's Station?

59:45.073 --> 59:48.410
Did you assume
the most brilliant scientist...

59:48.577 --> 59:52.372
...in the universe
would be from Earth?

59:53.457 --> 59:54.875
Yeah.

59:59.838 --> 01:00:01.465
Movies?

01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:04.802
- Nine words.
- Good, Mr. Franklin.

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.346
Fire? Cigarettes?

01:00:07.554 --> 01:00:10.182
- Clouds, clouds.
- Smoke?

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:14.561
<i>Butch and Sundance: The Early Years.</i>

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:23.821
- Death!
- Sorry.

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:30.160
<i>Smokey and the Bandit III.</i>

01:00:30.369 --> 01:00:33.205
Smokey is the bandit!

01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:45.426
Excuse us. Martians?

01:00:46.093 --> 01:00:49.471
First, my friend,
Bill and I congratulate you...

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.766
...on a well-played round of charades.

01:00:52.975 --> 01:00:55.227
You've been referred to us...

01:00:55.436 --> 01:00:59.273
...as the most brilliant scientists
in the universe.

01:01:00.899 --> 01:01:03.902
Would you help us build
good robot usses...

01:01:04.111 --> 01:01:07.990
...to save two princesses
from bad robot usses?

01:01:17.416 --> 01:01:19.668
Sounds good, Station.

01:01:23.338 --> 01:01:25.174
Let's rock, Death.

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:56.330
- We're alive.
- Yeah.

01:01:56.497 --> 01:02:01.001
But I think a buzzard
was pecking at my head.

01:02:06.673 --> 01:02:09.134
Dinner's over, worm-dude.

01:02:12.846 --> 01:02:14.640
You guys okay?

01:02:16.141 --> 01:02:18.018
Where's Death?

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:28.529
You okay, dude?

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:34.284
I'm fine.

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:44.711
First, we go back to town
and clean up.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.256
Second, we warn the princesses.

01:02:47.423 --> 01:02:51.343
Third, we buy stuff
to build good robot usses.

01:02:53.345 --> 01:02:55.055
Let's go.

01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.269
What? What?

01:03:15.033 --> 01:03:18.579
Here, kitty, kitty!
Here, kitty, kitty!

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:20.497
There's one, dude!

01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:24.251
Just missed, dude.

01:03:25.127 --> 01:03:27.421
Dude, we're there.

01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:29.339
Okay. I got an idea.

01:03:50.778 --> 01:03:53.113
How's it going, lady humans?

01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:24.937
Okay, this is Builders Emporium...

01:04:25.104 --> 01:04:29.024
...a repository for electronics
and robot materials.

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:32.736
Get what you need to make metal usses.

01:04:36.531 --> 01:04:40.702
- Ready for the big night?
- No! We're not going.

01:04:43.414 --> 01:04:46.500
I think you guys
should stop right there.

01:04:47.626 --> 01:04:50.003
Catch you later, future wife.

01:04:52.381 --> 01:04:54.007
Evil breath!

01:04:54.299 --> 01:04:55.300
Who are you?

01:04:55.509 --> 01:04:57.636
Well, you see...

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:11.024
Come on.

01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:16.697
- Any luck?
- They're not at our place or theirs.

01:05:16.864 --> 01:05:21.368
I'll try your dad's.
Maybe they went to talk to Missy.

01:05:30.335 --> 01:05:31.837
Logan residence.

01:05:32.045 --> 01:05:35.382
Evil Bill S. Preston,
Esquire, speaking.

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:41.388
It's them! They're back from the dead.

01:05:41.597 --> 01:05:43.807
We get to kill them again.

01:05:44.016 --> 01:05:45.267
Excellent!

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:03.494
See you real soon.

01:06:07.373 --> 01:06:10.667
- But this time we're ready for you!
- Yeah!

01:06:14.296 --> 01:06:16.757
We can be ready for them too.

01:06:16.965 --> 01:06:20.010
Good luck getting
in the concert, losers!

01:06:26.684 --> 01:06:30.354
<i>- Initiate the final plan.</i>
<i>- You got it, great one.</i>

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:34.441
<i>Do not fail me.</i>

01:06:35.442 --> 01:06:37.069
<i>Metallic buffoons.</i>

01:06:43.117 --> 01:06:46.286
- That other me is a dick.
- Yeah.

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:51.333
I hope the Stations
know what they're doing.

01:07:10.811 --> 01:07:13.272
Station! What are you doing?

01:07:15.441 --> 01:07:19.278
Dudes! This is no time
to be playing games!

01:09:39.334 --> 01:09:41.377
That one's me, right?

01:09:44.756 --> 01:09:46.508
Not bad.

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:49.261
How's it going, Good Robot Bill?

01:09:50.136 --> 01:09:51.971
How's it doing?

01:10:03.942 --> 01:10:05.819
<i>Kate Axelrod for KJM...</i>

01:10:06.028 --> 01:10:09.948
<i>... reporting live from</i>
<i>the San Dimas Auditorium.</i>

01:10:10.157 --> 01:10:13.243
<i>We're rocking at</i>
<i>the Battle of the Bands.</i>

01:10:13.452 --> 01:10:16.872
<i>So stay tuned and hold tight</i>
<i>until we find out...</i>

01:10:17.123 --> 01:10:20.333
<i>... who will be your winner.</i>

01:10:30.427 --> 01:10:31.804
Ready? You're up.

01:10:32.012 --> 01:10:33.430
Where are the girls?

01:10:33.639 --> 01:10:38.018
- Hanging from the rafters.
- We'll kill them at the finale.

01:10:38.852 --> 01:10:40.854
Good luck, gentlemen.

01:10:47.569 --> 01:10:49.071
Check it out.

01:10:51.156 --> 01:10:52.533
Not bad.

01:11:18.142 --> 01:11:21.479
Let's hear it for Primus!

01:11:59.141 --> 01:12:01.769
- Are they ready?
- Station.

01:12:01.935 --> 01:12:03.812
Excellent work, dude.

01:12:03.979 --> 01:12:08.066
- What about me? I made the wigs.
- Okay, Death.

01:12:08.317 --> 01:12:11.612
I helped do the shopping.
I pushed the cart.

01:12:11.737 --> 01:12:15.032
- Do they work like we asked?
- Station.

01:12:18.452 --> 01:12:21.580
You're a most excellent scientist.

01:12:22.289 --> 01:12:25.876
Plus, you got an excellently huge
Martian butt.

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:34.968
Feel free to split
in two parts again and relax.

01:12:35.135 --> 01:12:39.473
Don't overlook my butt.
I work out all the time.

01:12:39.682 --> 01:12:42.768
And reaping burns a lot of calories.

01:12:47.314 --> 01:12:52.277
Ready to take on those evil usses
and save the babes?

01:12:53.904 --> 01:12:57.908
<i>Fight evil usses. Save the babes.</i>

01:12:58.075 --> 01:13:00.869
- Ready, Bill?
- Ready, Ted.

01:13:02.121 --> 01:13:03.997
Let's go get 'em.

01:13:04.206 --> 01:13:06.959
And now, the last band of the evening.

01:13:07.167 --> 01:13:09.920
Wyld Stallyns!

01:13:20.639 --> 01:13:23.017
How's it going, worms?

01:13:23.517 --> 01:13:26.228
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

01:13:26.478 --> 01:13:29.106
And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan!

01:13:29.314 --> 01:13:34.069
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

01:13:35.613 --> 01:13:37.739
Hold it right there!

01:13:40.867 --> 01:13:43.120
We're Wyld Stallyns!

01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:47.249
No, dudes. We're Wyld Stallyns!

01:13:49.876 --> 01:13:53.922
You totally killed us,
you evil metal dickweeds!

01:13:54.172 --> 01:13:56.758
Yeah, and we're gonna do it again!

01:13:56.967 --> 01:14:00.762
Plus, we're gonna totally
kill your girlfriends.

01:14:08.896 --> 01:14:12.315
Don't worry, babes! We'll save you.

01:14:14.985 --> 01:14:18.530
Everybody, say hello
to Station's creation!

01:14:18.822 --> 01:14:21.784
Good Robot Bill and Ted!

01:14:35.255 --> 01:14:37.299
We may have met our match.

01:14:37.591 --> 01:14:40.678
Kudos to you, good human usses.

01:14:42.513 --> 01:14:46.976
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted!
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

01:15:23.345 --> 01:15:25.639
- Elizabeth!
- Theodore!

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:29.018
- Joanna!
- William!

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:43.824
Who is that?

01:16:01.425 --> 01:16:02.509
Who are you?

01:16:03.677 --> 01:16:05.387
Who am I?

01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:15.022
I am De Nomolos.

01:16:16.064 --> 01:16:18.025
I am their master.

01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:23.030
And I must see to it that you die.

01:16:25.741 --> 01:16:27.451
But first...

01:16:52.851 --> 01:16:57.939
<i>We are now transmitting on every</i>
<i>channel throughout the world.</i>

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.359
My word!

01:17:04.863 --> 01:17:08.075
<i>I want the whole universe</i>
<i>to behold this...</i>

01:17:08.284 --> 01:17:10.953
<i>... transfer of power.</i>

01:17:12.371 --> 01:17:15.416
<i>No longer will our future society...</i>

01:17:15.624 --> 01:17:18.793
<i>... be based on</i>
<i>the ideas and the music...</i>

01:17:19.044 --> 01:17:21.546
<i>... of these two fools!</i>

01:17:24.091 --> 01:17:27.094
<i>They will be based on my ideas...</i>

01:17:29.054 --> 01:17:31.515
...and my ideas alone!

01:17:32.891 --> 01:17:35.895
How do we get out of this?
There's no time.

01:17:36.019 --> 01:17:39.815
We do. After we get away
from this guy...

01:17:39.982 --> 01:17:45.070
...we time-travel back and set up
the things we need to get him now.

01:17:45.279 --> 01:17:47.197
Yeah, like what?

01:17:47.823 --> 01:17:49.867
Like a sandbag.

01:17:55.748 --> 01:17:57.082
Excellent!

01:17:57.291 --> 01:17:59.418
Then we'll get a cage.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:08.468
My friends.

01:18:09.136 --> 01:18:11.555
I too can play the time game.

01:18:11.764 --> 01:18:15.059
If you do that,
once I have vanquished you...

01:18:15.309 --> 01:18:19.354
...I'll go back and set up this key.

01:18:29.823 --> 01:18:32.576
And another gun.

01:18:42.335 --> 01:18:46.256
Right. Only there's one thing
you didn't think of.

01:18:46.465 --> 01:18:49.635
Only the winners can go back
and set things up.

01:18:49.843 --> 01:18:51.845
And that's gonna be us.

01:18:52.054 --> 01:18:56.100
We set up the key,
and we set up the gun.

01:18:58.686 --> 01:19:00.687
Excuse me.

01:19:00.896 --> 01:19:03.857
Your shoelaces are untied.

01:19:10.656 --> 01:19:11.948
Melvined.

01:19:25.879 --> 01:19:27.423
You're under arrest.

01:19:27.589 --> 01:19:29.341
Way to go, Dad!

01:19:34.179 --> 01:19:36.056
Book him, Danno.

01:19:43.063 --> 01:19:44.690
Good job, Death.

01:19:49.945 --> 01:19:51.697
Who was that guy?

01:19:51.864 --> 01:19:54.992
I can answer that question.

01:19:55.325 --> 01:19:57.620
Ms. Wardroe, thanks for the help.

01:19:58.287 --> 01:20:00.331
We definitely...

01:20:01.039 --> 01:20:03.041
Take it off, baby!

01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:13.093
Rufus!

01:20:13.302 --> 01:20:14.636
When did you get here?

01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:17.181
Just in time for your audition.

01:20:17.515 --> 01:20:20.851
So you were Ms. Wardroe all along.

01:20:21.769 --> 01:20:24.730
Would anyone else have let you
in this contest?

01:20:28.734 --> 01:20:32.029
That was Chuck De Nomolos,
my old gym teacher.

01:20:32.196 --> 01:20:36.700
And, by the way, sit-up champion
of the 27th century.

01:20:36.908 --> 01:20:41.413
And now, gentlemen, I believe
the stage belongs to you.

01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:42.998
Thanks, Rufus.

01:20:56.136 --> 01:20:58.722
<i>Dude, we still don't know how to play.</i>

01:20:59.223 --> 01:21:01.392
Maybe we ought to get good.

01:21:01.642 --> 01:21:02.852
How?

01:21:25.124 --> 01:21:29.294
That was a fast 16 months
of intensive guitar training.

01:21:30.504 --> 01:21:33.716
Except for the two-week
medieval honeymoon.

01:21:35.676 --> 01:21:38.137
Hello, San Dimas!

01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:41.807
Let me introduce you
to a little friend.

01:21:42.099 --> 01:21:43.767
This is little Ted.

01:21:44.309 --> 01:21:46.729
Hello, little Ted!

01:21:46.937 --> 01:21:48.814
This is little Bill.

01:21:52.359 --> 01:21:55.529
Now for the rest of our band.

01:21:58.741 --> 01:22:03.537
On conga and bongos, proof that
you can't tell a book by its cover...

01:22:03.746 --> 01:22:06.457
...the dude who can make one word
mean anything...

01:22:06.665 --> 01:22:08.584
...Station!

01:22:13.672 --> 01:22:15.257
Our backup dancers...

01:22:15.424 --> 01:22:18.135
...Station's most bodacious
creations...

01:22:18.302 --> 01:22:21.138
...the Good Robot Usses!

01:22:27.519 --> 01:22:28.687
And over here...

01:22:28.896 --> 01:22:31.857
...our bass player,
the Duke of Spooks...

01:22:32.065 --> 01:22:34.818
...the Doc of Shocks,
the Man With No Tan...

01:22:35.027 --> 01:22:37.863
...please say hello
to Death himself...

01:22:38.113 --> 01:22:39.907
...the Grim Reaper!

01:22:47.707 --> 01:22:50.334
<i>You might be a king</i>
<i>Or a little street sweeper</i>

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.921
<i>But sooner or later</i>
<i>You dance with the Reaper</i>

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.428
Get down with your bad self!

01:23:08.018 --> 01:23:10.687
I love show business.

01:23:11.897 --> 01:23:13.690
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:23:14.357 --> 01:23:16.402
...we've been to the past.

01:23:16.777 --> 01:23:18.612
We've been to the future.

01:23:19.029 --> 01:23:21.448
We've been all around the afterlife.

01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:23.450
And you know...

01:23:25.536 --> 01:23:27.538
The best place to be...

01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:31.833
...is here.

01:23:32.876 --> 01:23:34.836
And the best time to be...

01:23:35.295 --> 01:23:36.755
...is now.

01:23:42.594 --> 01:23:45.347
And all we can say is...

01:23:47.307 --> 01:23:48.559
...let's rock!

01:23:49.769 --> 01:23:51.312
One! Two!

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.273
One, two, three, four!

01:25:18.690 --> 01:25:21.527
Right good! Right good!

01:27:54.054 --> 01:27:56.056
<i>You are go, Stallyn!</i>

01:27:57.057 --> 01:27:59.351
<i>Come home soon. We'll miss you.</i>
