02:00.560 --> 02:02.711
<i>Have you not heard?</i>

02:02.800 --> 02:07.795
<i>The Lord is the everlasting God,</i>
<i>the Creator of the ends of the Earth.</i>

02:09.360 --> 02:12.671
<i>He will not grow tired or weary,</i>

02:12.760 --> 02:15.639
<i>and His understanding no one can fathom.</i>

02:20.160 --> 02:24.598
<i>He gives strength to the weary</i>
<i>and increases the power of the weak.</i>

02:26.240 --> 02:30.359
<i>Even youths grow tired and weary,</i>
<i>and young men stumble and fall.</i>

02:30.440 --> 02:34.673
<i>But those who hope in the Lord</i>
<i>will renew their strength.</i>

02:37.160 --> 02:39.755
<i>They will soar on wings like eagles.</i>

02:39.840 --> 02:42.639
<i>They will run and not grow weary.</i>

02:42.720 --> 02:45.474
<i>They will walk and not be faint.</i>

02:47.360 --> 02:50.239
Desmond, hang on!

02:51.440 --> 02:53.750
Hang on, Desmond!

02:53.840 --> 02:56.878
We're going to get you out of here!

03:11.240 --> 03:14.711
Desmond. Desmond!

03:15.360 --> 03:16.350
What?

03:16.440 --> 03:19.433
- Wait up.
- Catch up.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.876
Wait up, I've got something to tell you.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.755
What, Hal?

03:27.760 --> 03:29.274
Race you to the top.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.953
Hey! Cheater!

03:40.800 --> 03:43.998
- See you later, slowpoke.
- Hey!

03:49.800 --> 03:52.269
- Want a hand?
- I got it.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.794
- Sit down!
- Ah, you dope!

03:59.880 --> 04:01.280
- Quit it.
- You quit it.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.232
For Pete's sake.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.597
Hey! Get away from that ledge,
you damn fool kids!

04:11.680 --> 04:13.273
You're going to break your necks!

04:14.560 --> 04:18.349
It's them Doss kids.
Crazy as their old man.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.717
They dug up the corner
of Jackson and Main...

04:32.560 --> 04:34.392
Putting in a sidewalk...

04:37.480 --> 04:39.472
You boys wouldn't recognize it now.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.950
Mind you, I doubt they'd recognize you.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.837
They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.351
It's like I died with you.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.680
It's like we boys never existed.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.040
Well, that's all I got for you today.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.234
Block him with your right, Desmond.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.512
Stop it! Do you hear me?

05:45.600 --> 05:48.320
- What are they fighting about?
- When'd they ever need a reason?

05:48.400 --> 05:50.392
Tom! Ugh!

05:50.480 --> 05:52.551
Why stop 'em? Saves me whipping them both.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.472
This way, I just whip the one that wins.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.030
Tom!

05:59.120 --> 06:00.236
No!

06:00.320 --> 06:01.720
Oh, God.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.397
Tom! Wake up, can you hear me?

06:05.480 --> 06:06.596
What the hell have you done?

06:06.720 --> 06:07.870
He can't hear me.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.917
I'll get some ice.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.479
- You shift that basket.
- I got it.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.953
Is he breathing?

06:21.520 --> 06:24.080
Hal? Hal, can you hear me?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.478
Hal, can you hear me?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.995
Hal... Come on.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.719
He's dilated.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.516
Hal...

07:05.080 --> 07:08.790
What do you think you're doin'?

07:08.880 --> 07:13.955
I'm gonna have to beat you now,
you know the rules.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.510
You hear me, Desmond?

07:19.680 --> 07:22.115
- Desmond!
- Tom, stop.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.032
What's that gonna teach the boy?

07:24.120 --> 07:26.555
He's violent enough already.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.075
Okay, fine, you go smother him in kisses.

07:29.160 --> 07:32.710
You tell him the world's
a soft and gentle place.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.672
Hal's gonna be okay.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.509
Hey.

07:55.360 --> 07:59.752
- I could have killed him.
- Yes, you could have.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.639
Murder, it's the worst sin of all.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.200
And to take another man's life,

08:04.280 --> 08:07.990
that is the most egregious sin
in the Lord's sight.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.915
Nothing hurts his heart so much.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.360
Don't you understand English?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.798
Do I have to tell you again?

08:16.880 --> 08:18.917
You move, woman,
or I will wallop you good and hard!

08:19.000 --> 08:20.832
What the hell's going on?
You okay, Bertha?

08:20.920 --> 08:22.274
You mind your own damned business!

08:22.360 --> 08:24.511
Go sleep it off, Tom.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.880
I hate him.

08:42.159 --> 08:43.480
Momma?

08:45.960 --> 08:46.950
Oh.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.271
Why does he hate us so much?

08:59.720 --> 09:02.155
Oh, he don't hate us.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.671
He hates himself sometimes.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.954
Your daddy tonight,
that ain't the real him.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.200
I wish you knew him
like I did, before the war.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.680
<i># Praise the Lord</i>

09:19.160 --> 09:21.117
<i># Praise the Lord</i>

09:21.200 --> 09:24.477
<i># Let the people rejoice!</i>

09:24.560 --> 09:26.677
<i># Oh, come</i>

09:26.760 --> 09:31.198
<i># To the Father</i>
<i>Through Jesus the Son</i>

09:31.280 --> 09:34.876
<i># And give him the glory</i>

09:34.960 --> 09:39.876
<i># Great things he has done #</i>

09:39.960 --> 09:41.599
How'd we sound, Desmond?

09:41.680 --> 09:43.956
Like a heavenly host of angels, Mom.

09:44.040 --> 09:47.716
Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie,
especially in this place.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.395
Well, I ain't never said
they were singing angels.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.996
What's going on out there? Desmond!

09:58.080 --> 10:00.117
Get it up, get it up!

10:02.600 --> 10:04.512
Drag him out. Just the tarp.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.189
I'll phone an ambulance.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.397
No, no time. Joshua's pickup.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.834
- Quick!
- Okay.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.720
You're going to be fine now.
You're going to be fine.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.314
You're in good hands.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.480
What have we got here?

10:39.560 --> 10:41.040
It's a severed artery. Get some sutures.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.196
Yes, doctor.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.112
Put some pressure on it.
Did you apply this tourniquet?

10:44.200 --> 10:45.316
- Yes, sir.
- Nice work.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.880
You might have saved this boy's life.

10:48.360 --> 10:51.000
You staying with us?
You're going to be okay.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.673
What's your name, son?

10:52.760 --> 10:54.752
Gilbert.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.792
- Surgery?
- Yeah, surgery.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.837
Stay with us, you're gonna be okay.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.196
You feel pain?

11:04.200 --> 11:06.112
Stay with us, okay?

12:05.040 --> 12:07.555
Army physicals that way.
This is for giving blood.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.275
Are you all right?

12:17.000 --> 12:22.837
Oh, no, that's not mine. I'm fine.
Thank you for asking though, ma'am.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.436
What do you need?

12:31.240 --> 12:33.118
My belt.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.679
I lent it to the boy who had the accident.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.797
My pants don't hold up so good without it.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.920
Well, uh, I don't have your belt.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.559
No, I know that, ma'am. It's out there.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.040
It's right out there with the boy still.

12:48.160 --> 12:52.837
Okay. I'm just here to take blood.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.674
I'll give mine.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.832
Okay, go to that room over there
and wait with the others.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.320
I'll call you.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.879
That room.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.871
You ever given blood before, Mr...

13:19.040 --> 13:20.156
Doss.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.955
But my friends call me Desmond.
No, ma'am, this is my first time.

13:33.120 --> 13:38.434
I always dreamed about being a doctor.
But, uh, I didn't get much school.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.309
You may be a little dizzy when we're done.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.915
Is somebody picking you up?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.196
No, ma'am. Walking back.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.078
Where do you live?

13:50.160 --> 13:51.480
Fort Hill, ma'am.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.159
That's a ways.

13:53.240 --> 13:57.553
No. Just five or six miles,
but I cut through the woods.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.632
It's seven that way!

13:59.720 --> 14:01.996
You must really like the woods.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.072
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.117
Okay, put some pressure here.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.917
- You okay?
- Yeah.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.110
Bye.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.798
Where you going
looking all spruced and nice?

14:17.880 --> 14:20.759
Met someone yesterday.
A nurse over at the hospital.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.360
Her name's Dorothy Schutte.
I'm gonna marry her.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.352
Goodness. Does she know that?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.352
Well, not yet. She's about to.

14:26.440 --> 14:30.559
You ever even spoken to a woman?
I mean, one that's not family.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.070
Spoke to her.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.356
Well, in that case,
come give your brother a big hug.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.794
- Hal!
- Come here.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.599
Keep your greasy paws off of me.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.236
Wish me luck, Momma.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.190
Good luck.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.634
Next.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.872
Grab a seat. You ever given blood before?

15:24.960 --> 15:25.996
Yes, ma'am. I have.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.912
You're the belt man.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.514
Desmond, yes, ma'am.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.399
Well, Desmond, we can't
take your blood two days in a row.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.437
Well, that's good.
I came to get mine back.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.876
- You what?
- My blood. I need it back.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.035
Well, it don't work like that,
we can't just give it back to you.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.191
Well, you got to.

15:46.280 --> 15:49.951
Ever since you stuck me with that needle,
my heart's been beating real fast.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.316
Every time I think about you,
it beats faster still.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.433
I never heard that one before.
It's pretty corny.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.552
It is?

15:59.640 --> 16:02.917
That's a shame,
I done practiced that all night.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.036
No good?

16:06.480 --> 16:08.153
I didn't say that.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.874
What's the difference
between an artery and a vein?

16:33.160 --> 16:36.358
- What are you talking about?
- The boy's accident.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.154
Arteries spurt blood.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.640
And veins?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.036
Bleed.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.510
I think you need to practice

16:50.600 --> 16:53.434
your boy/girl dating talk
at home before you come out.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.352
Yeah, I probably do.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.151
I'll give you a book
if you're that interested.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.035
On dating?

17:03.120 --> 17:05.077
On blood.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.233
Another medical question perhaps?

17:16.319 --> 17:19.631
No. I just think you're the
prettiest thing I ever seen.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.271
That's because I'm sitting in the dark.

17:26.359 --> 17:30.354
No, you're just beautiful.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.913
Out of the way!

17:58.760 --> 18:00.797
You need to watch where you're going.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.393
I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd mind.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.630
You didn't ask.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.630
- I thought you might have liked it.
- Well, I might have if you'd asked.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.436
You coming?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.879
Watch where you're walking!

18:59.440 --> 19:01.079
Why didn't you say nothing to us?

19:01.200 --> 19:03.032
'Cause you would have tried
and talked me out of it,

19:03.160 --> 19:06.392
- and I know what I'm doing is right.
- And what about His Commandment?

19:06.480 --> 19:09.439
It's not killing in a war.
It's protecting.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.318
Loads of boys from our church are going.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.438
- Yeah.
- There is a war and they need men.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.876
And working in a paper mill
ain't going to save this country.

19:25.600 --> 19:30.038
Looks like a movie star, our boy.

19:32.480 --> 19:36.679
Nice uniform, good hat.

19:39.160 --> 19:43.279
Reminds me of how Artie Giddens looked
in his uniform when we went to France.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.993
- Remember him, Bertha?
- Don't, Tom.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.156
What?

19:50.000 --> 19:54.358
I'm just saying how snappy
Artie looked in his uniform.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.114
All you girls
certainly seemed to think so.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.159
He had them flocking to him.
He was most proud.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.958
I just hope that when our Hal gets shot,

20:08.040 --> 20:10.555
it's through the front of his jacket.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.758
Like a simple entry wound, not much mess.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.639
Artie got hit in the back,

20:15.720 --> 20:20.272
it blew most of his guts and intestines
out his front, offal everywhere.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.756
Wrecked his uniform entirely.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.154
It was lucky he was dead,

20:30.240 --> 20:33.597
so he never knew
how awful his uniform looked.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.879
Get outta of my sight.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.958
What are you, part mountain goat?

21:43.160 --> 21:45.516
Are you going to help me, Desmond Doss,

21:45.600 --> 21:47.432
or are you just going
to leave me stranded?

21:51.840 --> 21:54.514
I'll help you, but it's gonna cost you.

21:54.600 --> 21:55.670
What?

21:56.240 --> 21:57.230
A kiss.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.634
- That is pure blackmail.
- Well, yes, ma'am, it is.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.677
But that is still my condition.

22:07.440 --> 22:11.354
That's the deal.
And I'm going to hold you to it.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.318
Well, hold on now.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.552
You ain't gonna slap me, are you?

22:30.640 --> 22:32.996
'Cause I fall off,
I'm going to take you with me.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.353
Kiss me and find out.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.390
What?

23:26.800 --> 23:28.598
I have to enlist.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.395
I can't stay here while
all of them go fight for me.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.314
- Yes, you can. You can stay here.
- Dorothy, I have to.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.073
I want to be a medic.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.356
I figure I'll be saving people,
not killing them.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.676
I have to go to work.
I'm going to be late.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.310
Dorothy. Dorothy, darling.
Dorothy. Dorothy!

23:55.760 --> 23:57.752
So are you going to ask me
to marry you or what?

24:00.360 --> 24:02.158
Well, I don't know.
You still going to have me?

24:02.240 --> 24:05.392
Well, I wouldn't know, you haven't asked.

24:05.480 --> 24:10.111
Well, I'm asking you,
with all my heart and then some.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.240
- Will you marry me?
- Then, yes. Yes, I will.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.400
When?

24:25.480 --> 24:26.914
Soon as you get your first leave.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.151
But I still don't like you at this moment.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.278
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.795
Okay. Well, I love you.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.997
Shh!

24:47.080 --> 24:49.549
Momma said come see you here.

24:49.640 --> 24:50.710
Yeah.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.076
These three were my best friends.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.909
I grew up with 'em,

25:01.000 --> 25:02.719
I got into trouble with 'em,
chased girls with 'em.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.229
And I enlisted with 'em.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.797
Now my friends are there,

25:11.400 --> 25:14.552
covered in dirt and grass
and eaten by worms.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.392
I don't want to have
to visit my sons here.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.475
Daddy, I signed up already.

25:26.440 --> 25:30.912
I couldn't do otherwise, Pop.
Everybody else is doing...

25:31.000 --> 25:32.673
You ain't everybody else!

25:35.000 --> 25:37.913
Everybody else jumps in
and does things quick, without thinking!

25:38.000 --> 25:41.755
Like the damn idiot fools we were.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.560
And soldiers who live,
they live because they can do that!

25:44.640 --> 25:46.233
You can't!

25:46.760 --> 25:50.595
Look, you gotta sit
and think and pray about everything.

25:50.680 --> 25:53.639
I mean, look at you,
you're doing it right now.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.791
You won't be able
to live with yourself if you go.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.872
No, I won't be able
to live with myself if I don't.

25:57.960 --> 26:01.920
I'm going to be a medic.
That's going to be my way to serve.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.879
See, there you go, thinking it all out.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.359
What, you figure this war is just
going to fit in with you, your ideas?

26:10.440 --> 26:12.716
Well, I don't doubt it's going to be hard.

26:14.560 --> 26:17.473
It won't be hard, it'll be impossible.

26:17.560 --> 26:21.349
You know, whatever beliefs you have
in your crazy head now,

26:21.440 --> 26:24.592
they won't ever play out.
It don't work that way.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.673
And if by some, I don't know,
miracle chance you survive,

26:27.760 --> 26:30.514
you won't be giving no thanks to God.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.349
- Ready?
- Ready.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.476
Y'all need some air.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.517
Come on, fellas, shake a leg.
Uncle Sam's got you now.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.991
Say goodbye to Momma. Come on.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.476
Ladies, please, step away from the bus.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.359
- I almost forgot. Here.
- Do I need a crowbar?

26:49.080 --> 26:52.118
I want you to have this. It's mine.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.551
You keep it right here, where I'll be.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.997
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.633
I love you.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.117
Hey, don't say that about my girl.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.759
- What else...
- Hey. Oh.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.150
Hey. Sorry, pal.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.197
...means you're the person.

27:56.080 --> 27:59.596
- They got me a bum steer.
- Nah, it's just a bum.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.639
Do I have to gaze at your deformity
every time I walk to my bed?

28:02.720 --> 28:05.360
Gaze upon it in envy, my friend.

28:06.960 --> 28:11.557
You okay there?
You look lost. Vacancy right here.

28:11.640 --> 28:15.077
Wise choice. It's got views of
the mountains down to the lake.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.355
Randall Fuller.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.399
Desmond Doss.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.439
Call him "Teach." No one
understands a word he says.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.318
That's because no one else here can read.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.632
The testicles there belong to a man
calling himself "Hollywood."

28:27.720 --> 28:30.155
They look like they belong
to a smaller guy.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.833
You know testicles.

28:33.280 --> 28:36.910
Oh! Hey, I just got these shoes.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.198
Hey, uh, Grease Nolan, outta Red Hook.
Where you from?

28:40.320 --> 28:41.959
- Virginia.
- Ooh, hillbilly, huh?

28:42.040 --> 28:45.795
You marry your first cousin?
I'm just joking.

28:46.720 --> 28:47.836
Whoa!

28:47.920 --> 28:50.071
That's Smitty over there,
whipping Kirzinski's ass.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.560
Like you were doing
any better, chowder head.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.154
Hey, I didn't want to embarrass you.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.197
Wal Kirzinski, nice to meet you.

28:55.280 --> 28:58.239
Hey, beanpole,
what did you say your name was?

28:58.320 --> 28:59.549
Desmond Doss.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.913
That's Tex Lewis over there,
he thinks he's some kind of cowboy.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.710
And, uh, Vito Rinnelli.
He may be small, but he is a bulldog.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.075
- Hey.
- How you doing?

29:10.160 --> 29:11.753
- Desmond.
- Yeah.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.593
This handsome guy
right here is Lucky Ford.

29:13.680 --> 29:14.670
Hey.

29:14.760 --> 29:17.673
That's Walker and Pinnick over there
pretending they're card sharks.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.160
Pipe down, Grease, all right?

29:19.240 --> 29:21.391
Unless you want to
put your money where your mouth is.

29:23.120 --> 29:27.194
Oh, hey, the old good book, right?

29:27.280 --> 29:29.920
I think Lucky's got a good book.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.151
- Right, Lucky?
- It's a good read.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.751
Attention!

29:37.160 --> 29:38.640
Line up! Move it!

29:38.720 --> 29:41.076
Let's go, move it. Move it.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.877
You are a very strange-looking individual

30:12.960 --> 30:14.758
if you don't mind me saying so, Private.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.036
- Name?
- Andy Walker.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.793
How long have you been dead, son?

30:19.200 --> 30:21.271
- Sir?
- I am not "Sir"!

30:21.360 --> 30:26.230
I am Sergeant Howell or Sarge.
"Sir" you save for useless people.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.392
- The name is "Ghoul," you say?
- Walker, Sergeant!

30:31.480 --> 30:33.756
- Ghoul it is.
- Yes, Sergeant!

30:49.280 --> 30:52.034
There's something off
in your presentation, Private.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.958
Can't place it.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.154
Is it your hair?

30:57.400 --> 30:59.790
Is it the wrinkle in your trousers?

30:59.920 --> 31:01.115
I have a knife in my foot, Sergeant.

31:02.400 --> 31:06.030
Oh, yes, of course, that's it. The knife.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.952
- What is your name, soldier?
- Smitty Ryker.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.750
No, your name is Private Idiot.
Do you know why?

31:11.840 --> 31:14.719
- Because I have a knife in my foot.
- Who placed the knife there, Private?

31:14.800 --> 31:16.439
It was an accident, Sarge.
We was playing Stretch.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.758
I am heartened by the knowledge you
did not place it there with intention.

31:19.840 --> 31:22.674
Who threw the knife?

31:22.760 --> 31:25.992
I did, Sergeant. Private Kirzinski.

31:26.080 --> 31:29.790
You look part Indian.
To what tribe do you belong, son?

31:29.880 --> 31:31.200
No, I'm Polish.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.478
Wrong. I believe you must have
Cherokee or Shawnee blood in you.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.279
- No, Sergeant.
- Are you contradicting me,

31:36.360 --> 31:39.034
- you wagon-burning son of a bitch?
- No, Sergeant!

31:39.120 --> 31:41.032
Let me see your Indian war cry, son.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.236
I don't...

31:43.920 --> 31:46.037
Louder! Let me see it.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.914
What is your animal spirit?
Are you a garter snake?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.434
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a chipmunk?

31:51.520 --> 31:53.989
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a dancing reindeer?

31:54.080 --> 31:56.311
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you contradicting me, Private?

31:56.400 --> 31:59.040
- No, Sergeant!
- Good.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.271
Then I shall henceforth call you "Chief"

32:01.360 --> 32:03.591
as a sign of great respect to your people.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.110
Thank you, Sergeant!

32:08.120 --> 32:10.351
Are you grinning at me, boy,
or is that your natural state?

32:10.440 --> 32:11.430
No, Sergeant.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.716
- Name, Private?
- Desmond Doss.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.395
I have seen stalks of corn
with better physiques.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.870
Makes me want to pull an ear off, Private.

32:18.960 --> 32:20.997
- Can you carry your weight?
- Yes, Sergeant!

32:21.080 --> 32:23.231
Should be easy for you, then.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.515
- Corporal.
- Sergeant.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.831
Make sure you keep this man
away from strong winds.

32:26.920 --> 32:27.990
Yes, Sergeant.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.233
- Private Idiot.
- Yes, Sergeant.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.596
Raise your foot. Higher.

32:36.040 --> 32:40.159
Everyone outside. Now! Move it.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.196
I said move it.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.714
All right.
Just getting in my uniform, Sarge.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.395
- Did I ask him to, Corporal?
- No memory of it, Sarge.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.917
I believe any man who takes
such pride in his natural naked state

32:51.000 --> 32:53.310
will surely enjoy
the brisk of the outdoors.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.438
Now move your privates, Private Parts!

32:56.520 --> 33:00.514
Move it! You son of an exhibitionist!

33:01.480 --> 33:04.837
I am going to teach you
how to tie a bowline knot,

33:04.960 --> 33:08.078
so you can get your sorry asses
down from a height,

33:08.160 --> 33:10.277
so I may then kick them!

33:10.360 --> 33:13.432
Create a loop. This is the rabbit hole.

33:13.520 --> 33:17.150
The rabbit comes out of his hole,
runs around the tree,

33:17.240 --> 33:21.871
goes back into the hole.
All right, let's go!

33:24.040 --> 33:25.633
Very good, Tex.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.475
Keep struggling, Teach.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.074
Have you ever roped a goat, Hollywood?

33:30.960 --> 33:32.076
No, Sarge.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.833
Have you ever looked into a goat's eyes?

33:33.920 --> 33:35.434
- No, Sarge.
- Good, that would be unnatural.

33:38.040 --> 33:39.679
You know if you don't breathe, you'll die.

33:39.760 --> 33:43.117
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good, Private Idiot.

33:45.360 --> 33:49.320
Congratulations, Greaseball, you just
fell 50 feet and broke your neck!

33:50.640 --> 33:53.155
Brilliant, Private Vito Rinnelli.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.835
You strangled yourself, numb nuts!

33:55.920 --> 33:57.673
- Are you a fan of Benito?
- No, Sergeant.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.912
A bit taller.
If you were American, you'd be taller.

34:05.280 --> 34:09.320
What've we got here, Doss,
one for each titty?

34:09.440 --> 34:13.070
You were tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra!

34:15.400 --> 34:18.120
- What is so funny, Corporal?
- Couldn't tell you, Sergeant.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.797
Come on! Come on, ladies,
pick it up! Move it! Move it!

34:23.880 --> 34:26.520
I want to see some fire here.
A little hustle.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.000
Show me something!

34:28.080 --> 34:29.275
Run like you mean it!

34:29.360 --> 34:32.114
- Down, down, down! Faster, faster!
- Come on. Move it! Move it!

34:32.199 --> 34:34.715
Let's go, it's bath time, boys!
It's bath time!

34:36.080 --> 34:37.911
Move! Move! Move!

34:38.000 --> 34:40.071
I want to see you work. Let's go!

34:40.159 --> 34:41.799
Dig, dig, dig!

34:41.880 --> 34:44.349
Don't forget behind your ears.
Let's go. Move!

34:44.440 --> 34:48.116
I bet you're enjoying this,
you naked degenerate.

34:48.199 --> 34:51.398
Let's go! Hustle. Hustle. Hustle. Move!

34:52.960 --> 34:57.591
Let's go! What are we waiting on?
Let's go! Move your ass!

34:57.680 --> 35:00.639
Get the wood! Get the wall!
Don't get splinters!

35:00.720 --> 35:02.120
Drive!

35:02.200 --> 35:03.554
Drive!

35:03.640 --> 35:04.915
Jeez, are you okay?

35:05.040 --> 35:06.918
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:07.040 --> 35:10.636
- Some spirit here, boys. Move!
- Come on, move!

35:10.720 --> 35:13.633
What the hell is wrong
with you? No one said take a rest!

35:13.720 --> 35:17.031
Move your asses to the finish line!
Move! Move!

35:18.040 --> 35:19.918
Hustle! Hustle!

35:20.000 --> 35:22.196
Get your asses across that line!

35:23.400 --> 35:26.040
Time! Nice work, Doss!

35:32.400 --> 35:35.677
This is a personal gift
from the United States government

35:35.760 --> 35:37.433
to each and every one of you.

35:37.520 --> 35:42.072
A standard issue U.S. rifle,
caliber.30, M1,

35:42.200 --> 35:45.398
a clip-fed, shoulder-fired,
semi-automatic weapon

35:45.480 --> 35:49.190
designed to bring death
and destruction to the enemy.

35:49.280 --> 35:54.071
This is to be your lover,
your mistress, your concubine.

35:54.160 --> 35:58.120
Perhaps the only thing in life
you will ever truly love.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.079
Fellas, let's dance. Grab a girl.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.512
Don't point your gun forward.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.711
I do not want to be shot today.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.076
No matter how much you are tempted.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.072
Place the weapon by your side.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.520
Pay attention.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.754
Problem, Private Corn Stalk?

36:23.840 --> 36:27.675
Is there not one in your size,
or is it the color that is the issue?

36:27.760 --> 36:29.240
No, Sarge.

36:31.720 --> 36:35.236
I was... I was told
I don't have to carry a weapon.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.233
Come again? Step forward, Private.
I can't be hearing this right.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.679
Well, I'm sorry, Sergeant.

36:47.520 --> 36:49.352
I can't touch a gun.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.674
What exactly is the problem?

36:53.760 --> 36:55.877
No problem, just a mistake, sir.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.997
I told the Army when I joined up.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.673
That's not possible.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.956
Do you know why
it's not possible, Private?

37:02.040 --> 37:03.440
No, sir.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.160
Because the United States Army
does not make mistakes.

37:06.240 --> 37:10.439
So if there's a problem,
you must be that problem.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.592
I was just never supposed to be sent
to a rifle company.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.399
He's a C.O., sir.

37:20.320 --> 37:24.155
You're a conscientious objector,
and you joined the Army?

37:24.240 --> 37:28.519
Well, no, sir,
I'm a conscientious cooperator.

37:30.640 --> 37:34.520
- Are you screwing with me, Doss?
- No. No, sir. I volunteered.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.399
I ain't got no problem
with wearing my uniform,

37:37.480 --> 37:39.517
or saluting the flag and doing my duty.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.674
It's just carrying a gun
and the taking of human life.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.510
- You don't kill? That's all.
- Yes, sir, that's all.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.240
You know quite a bit
of killing does occur in a war?

37:51.320 --> 37:52.356
Yes, sir.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.397
I mean,
that is the essential nature of war.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.712
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

37:57.800 --> 38:01.111
Do you have any other requirements
of the United States Army?

38:01.200 --> 38:02.953
Is there anything else
that we can do to ensure

38:03.040 --> 38:04.633
that you have
a comfortable stay here with us?

38:04.760 --> 38:07.594
He doesn't want to work on Saturdays, sir.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.952
Well, Saturdays...
I'm a Seventh-day Adventist.

38:11.040 --> 38:16.035
So, Saturday is my Sabbath,
so I'm not allowed to work then.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.555
I don't think that poses a problem,
do you, Sergeant?

38:18.640 --> 38:21.235
We shall simply ask the enemy
not to invade on the Sabbath,

38:21.360 --> 38:23.079
'cause Private Doss here is at prayer.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.880
All right. Now we got that clear.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.272
Now let me tell you my requirements.

38:30.360 --> 38:34.559
They're not as complicated as yours.
They're very simple.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.599
As long as you're in this company,
under my command,

38:37.680 --> 38:39.717
you will obey my orders. Period.

38:41.760 --> 38:45.390
If you can't do it here,
I can't trust you to do it in battle.

38:49.080 --> 38:54.758
I'm putting you in for
a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.

38:54.840 --> 38:55.990
Dismissed.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.792
Gentlemen!

38:58.880 --> 39:01.634
I want you to meet Private Desmond Doss.

39:01.720 --> 39:05.873
Apparently, Private Doss
does not believe in violence.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.838
He does not practice violence.

39:07.920 --> 39:11.152
He will not even deign to touch a weapon.

39:11.240 --> 39:15.792
You see, Private Doss
is a conscientious objector.

39:15.880 --> 39:21.797
So I plead with you, do not look to him
to save you on the battlefield,

39:21.920 --> 39:27.314
because he will undoubtedly be too busy
wrestling with his conscience to assist.

39:27.400 --> 39:30.791
- Sarge, that's not true.
- Private, as you were.

39:33.920 --> 39:37.516
Now, I realize some of you
might have strong feelings about this.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.831
It is what we men fight for.

39:39.920 --> 39:44.790
To defend our rights,
and to protect our women and children.

39:44.880 --> 39:50.877
Even if Private Doss' beliefs
might cause women and children to die.

39:50.960 --> 39:53.475
So I will expect everyone in this company

39:53.560 --> 39:57.839
to give Private Doss
the full measure of respect he is due

39:57.920 --> 40:00.879
for the short time he will be with us.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.514
Am I clear?

40:02.600 --> 40:04.080
Yes, Sergeant.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.840
What'cha got there, Dessie?

40:18.800 --> 40:19.995
You know what that is.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.197
It just seems kind of small.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.919
It's half the Bible for half the man.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.593
For Pete's sake, Smitty,
give him back his Bible.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.319
I don't remember speaking to you.

40:31.480 --> 40:34.837
So, how come you don't fight?
You think you're better than us?

40:35.560 --> 40:36.596
No.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.875
What if you was attacked?

40:40.640 --> 40:42.074
Whoa!

40:42.800 --> 40:45.110
Say, like that.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.954
The Bible says to turn
the other cheek, don't it?

40:49.600 --> 40:52.718
See, I don't think this is a question
of religion, fellas.

40:52.800 --> 40:56.555
I think this is cowardice,
plain and simple.

40:56.680 --> 41:00.674
Is that right, Doss?
Are you chickenshit, that it?

41:02.800 --> 41:05.793
Go on, take a poke.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.914
Tell you what, I'm going to
give you a free shot.

41:09.840 --> 41:10.876
Right there.

41:12.440 --> 41:15.080
Hit me, Doss. Go on.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.554
- Let him have it.
- Go ahead.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.676
No?

41:20.640 --> 41:22.233
Chickenshit.

41:23.600 --> 41:24.636
Oh.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.795
Hold on here. What is this?

41:27.920 --> 41:29.240
Give me that.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.152
- This is a fine-looking broad.
- Nice.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.799
Hey, pass it around.

41:32.880 --> 41:36.920
Now, this would be the kind of
broad that deserves a real man.

41:38.280 --> 41:39.316
Give me that back.

41:40.560 --> 41:41.550
Please.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.153
Please.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.630
"Please give it back, Smitty."

41:47.720 --> 41:49.677
Please give it back, Smitty.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.437
Do you hear voices, Desmond?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.119
No, sir.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.830
But I understand that God
talks to you. Is that right?

42:10.920 --> 42:12.639
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.

42:12.720 --> 42:17.431
Is that how you feel most people
regard you, a crazy person?

42:17.520 --> 42:20.319
I'm different. I know that, but...

42:22.240 --> 42:24.391
I'm not going to pretend
to be something I'm not.

42:24.520 --> 42:27.433
- I am what I am.
- Sounds lonely.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.549
You lonely?

42:34.320 --> 42:37.074
- So, you don't hear voices.
- No, sir.

42:37.200 --> 42:43.436
I pray to God and I like to think He
hears me, but it ain't a conversation,

42:43.520 --> 42:46.354
like the one we're pretending
to have right now.

42:46.440 --> 42:48.272
- Pretending, Private?
- Well, yes, sir.

42:48.360 --> 42:51.512
I know all you really want to do is give
me a Section 8, drum me out of the Army,

42:51.600 --> 42:57.073
but I'm not off up above.
I just simply believe what I believe.

42:57.160 --> 43:01.120
Well, I'm trying to understand, all right?

43:01.200 --> 43:05.160
Was it God who told you
not to pick up a rifle?

43:05.240 --> 43:08.358
God says not to kill.

43:08.480 --> 43:10.233
That's one of His
most important Commandments.

43:10.320 --> 43:13.870
Most people take that to mean,
"Don't commit murder."

43:13.960 --> 43:17.317
War is a completely different
set of circumstances.

43:17.400 --> 43:21.872
Jesus said,
"A new Commandment I give unto you,

43:21.960 --> 43:24.953
that you love one another,
just as I have loved you."

43:25.080 --> 43:27.197
This is Satan himself we're fighting.

43:27.280 --> 43:30.557
Surely, as a good Christian,
you can see that.

43:30.640 --> 43:34.031
I can see that, sir,
and that is why I joined up.

43:36.480 --> 43:39.234
But I'm sorry, I will not bear arms.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.994
His religious views are certainly unique,

43:42.080 --> 43:45.596
but they do not constitute grounds
for a Section 8 discharge.

43:45.680 --> 43:48.718
How am I supposed to maintain discipline
with a man like that in my unit?

43:48.800 --> 43:50.280
I don't know.

43:50.360 --> 43:52.636
But he is a legitimate
conscientious objector,

43:52.720 --> 43:55.076
and he must be allowed
to work as a combat medic,

43:55.160 --> 43:58.710
provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training.

43:58.800 --> 44:03.477
Perhaps we could help
make believe in his idea.

44:03.560 --> 44:06.234
Yeah, you restrict him to barracks and KP.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.676
If he throws God at you,
you throw hell right at him.

44:08.760 --> 44:10.035
I want him gone.

44:27.120 --> 44:30.591
Doss, your area is a disgrace.
It's a pig sty!

44:31.840 --> 44:33.513
- Something funny, Ryker?
- No, Sarge!

44:33.600 --> 44:37.150
- You got some shit on your mind?
- No, Sarge!

44:37.720 --> 44:39.791
What you men fail to recognize

44:39.880 --> 44:44.636
is a unit is no better
than its weakest member!

44:44.720 --> 44:49.033
Now, to help you learn that lesson,
there will be no passes this weekend.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.555
You will all be on KP!

44:51.640 --> 44:55.031
Right now, everybody in full gear
for a 20-mile hike.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.760
Let's go! Let's go.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.637
Get your heads right.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.956
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.

45:06.040 --> 45:09.112
Makes me sick
see you feel sorry for yourself.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.510
You dogs don't know what tired is.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.796
We're going to keep going till I drop.

45:22.520 --> 45:25.672
Hey, knock it off. Trying to sleep here.

45:29.760 --> 45:32.070
- Get off me. Get off me.
- Okay. All right.

45:39.080 --> 45:40.673
Why the hell are you still here?

45:52.160 --> 45:53.514
As you were.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.116
Where's Doss?

46:25.640 --> 46:27.199
This isn't good for anybody.

46:27.280 --> 46:29.272
Sure ain't what I joined up for.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.754
It's not about what you joined up for.

46:34.840 --> 46:37.355
It's about the lives of every man in here.

46:38.840 --> 46:42.914
And yours, son. It's time to quit this.

46:44.080 --> 46:47.039
Finish getting dressed
and I'll walk you down.

46:53.320 --> 46:55.039
It's okay, Doss.

46:56.640 --> 46:58.154
There's no shame in this.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.558
Let's go.

47:16.080 --> 47:20.871
I got extra guard duty today,
and I'm on KP this morning, so...

47:23.880 --> 47:24.870
Can't.

47:31.320 --> 47:32.959
All right, Doss.

47:34.920 --> 47:39.119
Private Doss, can you identify
the men that beat you?

47:46.040 --> 47:47.872
No, Sarge.

47:47.960 --> 47:51.112
Are you saying that you
don't know who attacked you?

47:51.200 --> 47:53.112
I never said I was attacked, Sarge.

47:54.720 --> 47:57.713
Well, what the hell are you saying, Doss?

47:57.800 --> 47:59.951
You bruised half your body sleeping?

48:01.960 --> 48:03.952
I... I sleep pretty hard.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.513
Alright.

48:09.840 --> 48:12.116
If you plan on getting wet this weekend,
make sure you put on a hat.

48:12.240 --> 48:13.640
Next.

48:13.720 --> 48:15.837
Don't want anyone
coming back pissing cream.

48:15.920 --> 48:18.196
What, you don't want none
for your coffee, Sarge?

48:18.280 --> 48:20.840
How about a shot right now, Smitty?

48:20.960 --> 48:22.838
- You speaking from experience, Sarge?
- Next.

48:22.960 --> 48:24.997
You'd have to ask
your mom about that, Greaseball.

48:30.840 --> 48:31.876
At ease.

48:36.680 --> 48:40.435
Private Doss, I'm afraid
I can't authorize your pass.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.997
This is a furlough for men
who have passed the basic training.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.276
Well, sir, respectfully, sir, I have.

48:50.880 --> 48:53.190
I put in for this furlough
three weeks ago.

48:53.280 --> 48:55.476
I'm getting married this afternoon.

48:55.560 --> 48:58.439
It says you're not rifle qualified.

48:59.720 --> 49:02.440
Well, I'm not required to carry
a rifle, sir. Colonel Stelzer, he...

49:02.520 --> 49:05.752
Colonel Stelzer's determination was...

49:05.880 --> 49:08.714
"Doss must be allowed to
work as a combat medic,

49:08.840 --> 49:13.119
provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training."

49:13.200 --> 49:15.999
And you have not qualified
on the rifle range, Private.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.036
Pretty clear.

49:21.200 --> 49:26.229
Show me you know how to handle a rifle
and I'll sign your furlough.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.232
- Corporal Cannon.
- Sir!

49:28.360 --> 49:30.477
Hand Private Doss your firearm.

49:39.920 --> 49:44.119
- I won't touch a rifle, sir.
- I'm not asking you, Private!

49:44.200 --> 49:47.876
That is a direct order
from a company commander.

49:47.960 --> 49:54.196
For God's sake, Doss,
you stop this nonsense and quit.

49:54.280 --> 49:59.230
Refuse, and I will have no
recourse but to court-martial you,

49:59.320 --> 50:02.711
and you will spend the duration
of the war in a military prison.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.117
I can't, sir.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.999
How much longer would you
like to wait, Dorothy?

50:23.400 --> 50:25.790
I think it's been long enough.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.912
I'm so very sorry.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.310
Sometimes men just get cold feet.

50:33.440 --> 50:37.514
Some men might. Not my Desmond.

51:10.280 --> 51:13.159
You probably think
I'm a real son of a bitch

51:13.240 --> 51:15.994
who cares only about regulations
and not his men.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.110
May I?

51:27.240 --> 51:30.074
I believe in this book as much as any man.

51:30.160 --> 51:32.880
And just like any man,
I wrestle with my conscience,

51:32.960 --> 51:36.670
but what do you do when everything
you value in this world is under attack?

51:37.960 --> 51:39.519
I don't know, sir.

51:40.960 --> 51:44.158
I ain't got answers to questions that big,

51:44.240 --> 51:47.916
but I also feel like
my values are under attack,

51:48.040 --> 51:49.554
and I don't know why.

51:49.640 --> 51:53.634
I don't give a rat's ass about your
principles because the Japs don't.

51:53.720 --> 51:55.951
If one of them attacks you
and some wounded soldier,

51:56.040 --> 51:57.030
what are you gonna do?

51:58.040 --> 52:00.077
Hit him with your Bible?

52:00.160 --> 52:02.391
I'm prepared to give my life for my men.

52:02.480 --> 52:06.030
You don't win wars by giving up your life.

52:06.120 --> 52:10.956
Look, I'm only here because I don't want
to see you rotting in a prison cell.

52:11.040 --> 52:13.600
Plead guilty, throw yourself
at the mercy of the court.

52:13.680 --> 52:15.399
Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.

52:18.400 --> 52:21.040
Let the brave men out there
go and win this war.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.560
If I can't convince you, maybe she can.

52:34.600 --> 52:36.034
They wouldn't let me call you.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.959
I knew it wasn't your making.

52:43.680 --> 52:45.751
What have they done to you?

52:48.040 --> 52:49.599
It's okay, I'm all right.

52:49.680 --> 52:52.912
I just went a couple of
rounds with the wall and lost.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.198
They're saying you could
go to prison, Desmond.

52:56.280 --> 52:58.317
Leavenworth.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.312
There must be some other way.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.232
I don't know what that could be.

53:02.320 --> 53:04.437
I've done everything they asked me,
except this one thing,

53:04.520 --> 53:07.115
and I'm being treated like
a criminal just 'cause I won't kill.

53:07.200 --> 53:11.513
You tried. Nobody can say you didn't.

53:11.600 --> 53:13.239
But who are you going to save in prison?

53:15.640 --> 53:16.756
Probably nobody.

53:16.880 --> 53:19.634
Then why can't you just pick up
the stupid gun and wave it around?

53:19.720 --> 53:22.440
You don't have to use it,
just meet them halfway.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.710
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. It's just pride.

53:26.800 --> 53:29.759
Pride and stubbornness.
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.

53:43.080 --> 53:44.719
Have I been prideful?

53:46.600 --> 53:48.319
Maybe I am prideful.

53:52.600 --> 53:54.353
But I don't know how
I'm going to live with myself

53:54.440 --> 53:56.716
if I don't stay true to what I believe.

53:58.160 --> 54:00.231
Much less how you could live with me.

54:02.400 --> 54:05.757
I'd never be the man
that I want to be in your eyes.

54:12.440 --> 54:16.798
I fell in love with you
because you weren't like anyone else

54:18.800 --> 54:20.792
and you didn't try to be.

54:23.160 --> 54:27.837
Do not think for one moment
that you will disappoint me.

54:30.440 --> 54:34.195
I will love you no matter what.

54:46.600 --> 54:50.879
I don't know what he's gonna do.
He loses no matter what.

54:51.520 --> 54:52.749
<i>They want him to plead guilty,</i>

54:52.840 --> 54:54.991
<i>but then he'll get</i>
<i>a dishonorable discharge.</i>

54:55.080 --> 54:58.676
Otherwise he fights them,
and he for sure goes to prison.

54:58.760 --> 55:00.672
<i>Either way, they'll call him a coward</i>

55:00.760 --> 55:02.399
<i>and I don't see how he can live with that.</i>

55:03.720 --> 55:05.552
Well, thank you, Dorothy.

55:06.920 --> 55:09.389
If you get to talk to him,

55:09.480 --> 55:11.676
tell him that we love him
and that we're praying for him.

55:11.760 --> 55:13.911
<i>We're praying for both of you.</i>

55:14.000 --> 55:16.037
I will. Bye-bye.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.158
<i>Tom, you're out of your mind,</i>
<i>you're delirious.</i>

55:31.240 --> 55:32.754
<i>Of course, I'm out of my mind.</i>

55:32.840 --> 55:35.639
<i>What do you think I am?</i>
<i>I'm out of my mind.</i>

55:35.720 --> 55:37.598
<i>You leave this room.</i>

55:37.680 --> 55:39.239
No, Tom! Put it down!

55:39.320 --> 55:41.073
- Get away from me, woman!
- Hey!

55:58.880 --> 56:00.439
I got that, sir.

56:11.800 --> 56:13.234
May I help you, sir?

56:13.320 --> 56:15.880
I wish to speak to
Brigadier General Musgrove.

56:15.960 --> 56:18.794
Not without an appointment you can't.
That would be quite impossible.

56:25.440 --> 56:27.397
Uh, if you would kindly tell him

56:27.480 --> 56:31.269
Corporal Thomas Doss
would appreciate a brief word.

56:31.360 --> 56:34.353
He's in a very important meeting.

56:34.440 --> 56:38.480
I fought with him in France
at Belleau Wood. He was my captain.

56:41.120 --> 56:44.352
Please, ma'am, it's most vital.

56:47.960 --> 56:48.996
Thank you, ma'am.

56:54.200 --> 56:55.953
There's a man out there, Tom Doss.

56:56.960 --> 56:58.030
Doss?

57:02.400 --> 57:03.516
Be over in a minute.

57:03.600 --> 57:07.116
You'll be home safe and sound,
like nothing ever happened.

57:12.440 --> 57:13.669
I love you.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.631
This is a hearing into the matter
of Private Desmond Doss.

58:02.720 --> 58:05.280
The charge is disobeying
a series of direct orders

58:05.360 --> 58:06.555
from his commanding officer.

58:06.640 --> 58:08.950
How says the defendant?

58:09.520 --> 58:12.831
Private Doss wishes to enter
a "not guilty" plea.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.597
Is that so, Private?
I thought this was agreed.

58:16.720 --> 58:19.155
You wanted to enter
some sort of plea bargain.

58:20.960 --> 58:23.429
- Yes, sir, but I changed my mind.
- Just like that?

58:23.560 --> 58:26.200
You wish to proceed to a court-martial?

58:27.000 --> 58:28.480
- Yes, sir.
- Ah.

58:28.560 --> 58:32.713
Well, on your head, then, Private.
Proceed.

58:36.080 --> 58:40.279
Your Honor, Private Doss
waves his morality at us

58:40.360 --> 58:42.477
like it's some kind of badge of honor.

58:42.560 --> 58:46.236
He flaunts his contempt by directly
disobeying a series of direct orders

58:46.320 --> 58:47.549
from his commanding officer.

58:47.640 --> 58:50.280
When the very best of our young men
are sacrificing their lives against...

58:54.200 --> 58:56.431
- You okay?
- Yes.

58:56.520 --> 58:58.159
Are they still deliberating?

58:58.240 --> 58:59.435
Yes, sir.

58:59.520 --> 59:01.273
Okay, now you go take this in there.

59:01.360 --> 59:04.159
I can't. It's strictly military personnel.

59:04.240 --> 59:05.640
Well, then you get
one of them to take it in.

59:05.720 --> 59:07.996
They ain't out to help.
They're fixing to bury him.

59:08.080 --> 59:12.518
There is only one question that any
military court need ask of the accused.

59:12.600 --> 59:16.310
Do you deny disobeying
Colonel Sangston's direct orders?

59:19.240 --> 59:21.357
Well, do you, Private?

59:26.680 --> 59:29.798
- No, sir. I don't.
- Why are you contesting it, then?

59:29.920 --> 59:33.152
Why is it so important to you, given
your refusal to even touch a weapon,

59:33.240 --> 59:35.436
to serve in a combat unit?

59:35.520 --> 59:40.356
Because when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor, I took it personal.

59:41.080 --> 59:44.391
Everyone I knew
was on fire to join up, including me.

59:47.680 --> 59:52.755
There were two men in my home town...
declared 4-F unfit.

59:52.840 --> 59:55.355
They killed themselves
because they couldn't serve.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.438
I had a job in a defense plant
and I could've taken a deferment,

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.840
but that ain't right.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.392
It isn't right that other men
should fight and die,

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.070
that I would just be sitting at home safe.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.640
I need to serve.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.279
I got the energy
and the passion to serve as a medic.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.830
Right in the middle with the other guys.
No less danger, just...

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.072
While everybody else is taking life,
I'm going to be saving it.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.796
With the world so set
on tearing itself apart,

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.872
it doesn't seem like
such a bad thing to me

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.429
to want to put a little bit
of it back together.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.433
- Hmm.
- Sorry, sir, nobody's allowed to go...

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.591
No, you don't understand.
My son is the defendant.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.194
I understand, sir, but nobody's allowed...

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.590
- I have information that's important.
- Sir, you are not allowed...

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.592
While the sentiments
expressed are laudable,

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.479
the facts of the charge
seem incontestable, so...

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.877
What the hell is going on out there?

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.280
Let him go.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.470
- That's a Great War uniform.
- It is, sir.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.472
Sir, I need to show you this.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.678
With respect, sir, you are no longer
a member of the military.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.639
You are unable to attend this hearing.
I'm sorry.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.758
Is that truly the way it works, sir?

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.117
You fight for your country,
you lose so much that was dear to you,

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.112
and then you're done with?

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.510
The uniform is forgotten.
You have no voice.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.509
You were at Lys?

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.751
I was, sir. And at Belleau Wood.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.360
Twice decorated, I see.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.318
Yes, sir.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.835
I take it you are the Private's father.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.798
I am, sir. Thomas Doss.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.590
Then, as a former military man,
you know there are laws here...

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.320
Sir, I know the law and I know
my son is protected by those laws.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.676
They are framed in our constitution.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.752
And I believe in them, as he does.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.117
They are why I went
and fought to protect them.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.351
At least, that is what
I thought I was doing.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.874
Because if it wasn't for that,

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.429
then I have no idea what the hell
I was doing there, sir.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.552
Thank you, Corporal Doss.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.160
Let me have the letter.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.110
You must go.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.555
"The defendant's rights
as a conscientious objector

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.677
are protected by an Act of Congress

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.595
and he cannot be compelled
to waive those rights.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.197
That includes, in this case,
his disobeying orders to bear arms."

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.672
Signed, Brigadier General Musgrove,
War Services Commander, Washington, D.C.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.080
Colonel?

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:07.758
- I withdraw the charges, sir.
- Then this case is dismissed.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.151
Private Doss, you are free
to run into the hellfire of battle

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.199
without a single weapon
to protect yourself.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.874
You may resume your duties
and begin training as a combat medic.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.551
- Where is he?
- Gone. Straight after.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.472
I begged him to stay.
I told him you'd want to see him.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.677
No, I understand.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.672
When you get home,
you tell him I love him.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.399
Okay. Okay.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.680
You better come home to me.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.837
<i># Uncle Sam is mild</i>

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.559
<i># He's peaceful as a child</i>

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.433
<i># But never get him</i>
<i>riled or you'll be whipped #</i>

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.000
Hollywood, shut up.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.514
Come on, pipe down.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.319
- Shut up, man.
- Shut up!

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.471
I swear to God,
Hollywood, I will shoot you.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.677
Put a sock in it, will you?
Save the crowing for when we get there.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.672
Killjoy was here.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.155
Give him room.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.840
Clear! Clear! Move aside!

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.951
The 96th... or what's left of them.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.838
These are the guys we're replacing.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.475
- Seems good to me.
- Clear.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.040
- As gold.
- Clear.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.633
All clear, Sarge!

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.154
Captain Glover.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.711
Lieutenant Manville, 96th.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.678
We've been assigned to you, sir.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.399
Okay.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.517
- Let's get these men some chow.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.954
This is, uh, Sergeant Howell.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.315
- Good to meet you, sir.
- Sit down.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.436
Who's Doss?

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.240
Over there.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.755
You Doss?

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.680
Irv Schecter.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:16.354
You, and me and Page here are about the
only medics we got left in this area.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.399
So, I guess we're gonna be
working together.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.878
You just come off the line?

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.189
What's it like?

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.954
I said, what's it like?

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.279
Hacksaw.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.480
We climbed up six times.
Six times, they threw us off.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.674
Last time, there wasn't
anything left of the 96th.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.995
They're animals.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.032
Stinking animals.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.271
Nips don't care if they live or die.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.553
They want to die. They keep coming at you.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.200
And they ain't never going to give up.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.759
Never.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.672
Here. Hey, buddy.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.398
The Japs deliberately target the wounded.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.473
Lose all your Red Cross markings.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.791
Nips put a premium on shooting medics.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.319
The white is a bull's-eye.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.712
Here, I got you a new helmet.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.399
One size fits all.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.638
That's our objective. Hacksaw Ridge.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.390
We take it, maybe we get Okinawa.

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:45.473
We get Okinawa, we take Japan.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.310
Take a breather. Our pals in the Navy
are going to soften them up for us.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.317
Nobody can survive that shit.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.398
Oh, but they can.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:44.238
Lieutenant, these bunkers here,
here and here, is that accurate?

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:48.238
Yeah, there's three...

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.877
Yes, sir, maybe a little further back,
but it's all...

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.517
It's all different up there.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.353
<i>All clear, Captain.</i>

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.514
Gents, move out.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.279
It's blood.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.589
No shit.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.472
We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:45.950
Keep climbing.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.518
Here, come on.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.910
Coming through, make way. Out of the way.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.795
- Brown.
- What?

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.950
Give this to Jessop.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.030
Corporal!

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.476
Incoming!

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.075
Get down!

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.876
Get down!

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.675
Where the hell are they?
I can't see nothing.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.156
- Beats me, pal.
- Where the...

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.960
Medic!

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.191
We're over here!

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.716
Put your hand right here.
Put your hand on there, Jack.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.598
Come on, come on.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.240
Come on, we're going to get you
under cover. Come on, come with me.

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.834
Come with me, Jack.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.439
Keep moving forward! Move!

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.115
I can't see anything.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.953
- Is that one?
- I don't know. Just shoot!

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.994
All right, let's go.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.830
Vito!

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:51.954
Oh, shit.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.629
- Medic! Vito's down!
- I'm coming!

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.791
Okay. I'm here.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.076
Get out of the way!

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.550
You hurt?

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.953
I'm fine.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.195
Come on, I got you, Ralph. Just breathe.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.273
Just breathe. Just breathe, Ralph.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.431
Just breathe, Ralph, just breathe.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.115
I got you, I got you. I got you. Come on.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:34.917
Hey! Hey! Give him a shot
of morphine and move on.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.560
He's not going to last a day.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.997
Please. Please, Doss, no.
No. Don't leave me.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.549
Don't leave me.
God, please don't leave me.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.552
I've got kids!

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.678
Please. Please, don't.
Please, don't leave me.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:51.753
I ain't going anywhere.
I'm going to get you home.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.072
I got you, Ralph. Okay?
I'm going to get you home.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.877
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.519
It's going to kick in real quick, Ralph.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.592
We're going to get you shifted.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.191
Stretcher! Stretcher!

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.671
- Get up. Keep moving, son.
- I can't, I'm wounded.

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.955
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.400
Shit! Hang on, kid.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.109
Move. A sitting duck's a dead one.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.917
Move. Go, go, go!

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.673
This guy's a priority.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:32.719
We got him, we got him. Here.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.878
A priority? You ever heard of triage?
He'll be dead before we get him down.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.110
You don't know that!

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:44.115
Get him down. All right? Huh?

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.999
- Okay. Okay. Go.
- Okay. Okay.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.997
It's all right, buddy.
We're going to get you home.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.630
Medic! Help! Help.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.918
I figure if we can't see them,
then they can't see us neither.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.430
Help!

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.953
I got you, Frank. Where you hit?

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.072
- I think they can see us, smart ass!
- Doss, come on, come on.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.355
Give me a hand here.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.713
Get down, sir.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.951
Over there! The bunkers.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.760
I see them. Better stay down, sir.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.316
- I got 'em, dead ahead.
- Yeah, I see 'em, too.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.596
Push in as close as you can.
Give them everything you've got.

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.717
I'll send in the
weapons team to flank them.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.952
You keep that tight, you're going to be
right as rain. All right?

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.793
I got him, Doss. I got him.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.951
Here you go, come on now.
Come sit over here.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.076
Hey.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.109
You doing okay?

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.270
Okay.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.914
And, fire!

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:42.670
Down!

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.519
Son of a bitch.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.672
- You, get on it.
- Yes, sir!

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.878
Take 'em. Go. Fire!

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.880
Cover!

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.553
Go, go. Go, Ghoul.
Get in the hole. Stay there.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.909
Go! Go, Smitty, we'll cover you. Leapfrog.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.189
Cover.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.593
Satchel!

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.752
- Ghoul!
- Clear.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:51.070
Come on, stick it. Stick it, Ghoul.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.158
Cover! Cover!

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.673
Son of a bitch.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.159
Cover his ass.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.160
Medic! Medic! Help me.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.550
Go!

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.349
Medic!

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.357
I'm here. Put your hand on it.
Put your hand on it!

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.356
Go, go, go!

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.751
Ghoul. Ghoul.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.158
You're okay. Where you hit?

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.712
You got a bump on the head, that's okay.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.755
What's your name?

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.315
- Andy.
- Andy what?

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.480
Andy Walker.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.358
Also known as?

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.750
Ghoul.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.638
Ghoul. Ghoul, you're okay, you're okay.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.956
Good job, men. Good work.

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.555
Dig in for the night. We hold this spot,

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.200
we mop up the rest of the ridge tomorrow.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:16.477
Okay, boys. Find yourself a nice
safe hole in or near the bunker.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.472
Rotate watch every two hours.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.632
We don't know what's out there.
Heads down, asses lower.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.518
And shoot anything
that don't speak English.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:26.320
- Does that include Grease, Sarge?
- Particularly him.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.676
I don't care if you need to
take a piss or a dump,

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.752
it ain't safe to go out there alone.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.354
Over here, now!

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.954
Where the hell are you going, Doss?

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.631
Still more wounded out there, Sarge.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.359
I'll go with him.

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.477
Be smart. Keep your ears down.

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.079
All right, let's find a spot.

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.111
Rinnelli and Henry dead in
the first 15 minutes, just straight off.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.551
Straight off.

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:04.839
Peterson, Popeye. Standford and Murphy.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.000
Page and Unger.

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.358
Ralston.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:18.279
"In peace, sons bury their fathers,
in war, fathers bury their sons."

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.199
You wanna stop spouting that crap, huh?

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.194
It don't help none.

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:31.797
Yeah, you got that right. Not here.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.159
Hey, give me that.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.874
Hey, we've got an abdominal wound.

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:49.156
This man is going to need some plasma.

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.594
- You got it.
- Leave him with us.

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.797
Okay. You're okay now. They got you.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.594
Should we find a hole and dig in?

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.550
Sounds good to me.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.429
Put your helmet on.

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:19.880
You ain't going to eat them?

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.870
I don't eat meat. Help yourself.

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.670
Of course you don't.

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.195
That's one heck of a dame.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.753
You know you're fighting out of your
weight class with her, don't you?

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.599
Yes, I do.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.879
Don't tell her that.

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.917
She'd be much happier
with a man like me anyway.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.957
Yeah, until she got to know you.

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.638
I'm an asshole sometimes.

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.316
Sometimes?

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.712
Yeah, all right. All right.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.354
These Japs are sneaky.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.835
I'll take first watch, all right?
You get some shut-eye.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.870
Hell of a dream.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.000
Dreamed I got myself skewered.
I couldn't do nothing.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.790
Rifle's just there.

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.109
It won't bite.

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:03.995
Yeah, it will.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.480
Look around you.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.836
After what we've just been through,

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.957
any sane man would be
screaming for a weapon.

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.952
I never claimed to be sane.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.673
My daddy's a drunk.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.039
He fought it for years,
but it kind of got a hold of him hard.

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.270
Made him mean.

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:29.635
Least you knew him.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.952
Mine could have been any one of 10 guys,
and none of them worth a damn, so...

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.399
So, your momma raised you?

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.552
I knew her, but she gave me
to an orphanage when I was five.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.915
Never saw her again.

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.833
I learned how to hate quick.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.870
I learned how to judge people quicker,
and I got you very wrong.

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.153
My daddy used to beat me and my brother
just because the sun rose,

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.357
and then whip us just because it set.

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.320
I could take that...

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.916
...but when he would do it to our momma...

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.151
Get away from me, woman!

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:25.798
That's enough. No more. Do you hear me?

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:27.712
Pull the damn trigger.

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:32.352
Stop it! Stop!

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.715
But you didn't kill him?

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.318
In my heart, I did.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.712
So that's why I made my promise to God,

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.871
I ain't never going to touch a gun again.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:16.075
Well, I ain't giving you mine,
'cause you're crazy.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.435
Son of a...

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.355
Son of a bitch.

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:23.318
Move, move! Get your asses over here.

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.720
Let's go!

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:46.597
Fall back, fall back! Go!

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.717
They're coming from underground.

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.675
Searchlight, this is Baker Six.
Request immediate support.

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:09.639
Target is Yoke-Tare-Five-One-Five.

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.677
Yes! Yes, I know
that's where the hell we are,

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.274
but I don't expect to be here much longer!

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.713
I called an artillery strike.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.474
Fall back. Move. Move!

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.111
Fall back! Incoming!

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.796
Hey, buddy. I'm right here. Right here.

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:06.590
Okay.

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.875
Cover me.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.910
Go, go!

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.352
Get out of here, kid!

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.389
Come here, son.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.435
You know what to do. Keep pressure on it.

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.710
No! Don't need plasma. Give it to him.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:47.999
Over there. I'll be okay. Go. Go.

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.753
- Grease! Get Irv's back.
- What?

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:51.832
- You got it, okay.
- See you soon.

01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:59.474
Come on. Come on.

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.839
We gotta move right now. Come on, come on.

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.113
Go! Go! Go!

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.595
Change!

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.919
There's too many,
get the hell out of here!

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.719
Move! Move!

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.833
- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- It's going to help the pain.

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:42.952
No, don't. Don't you do that. Come on.

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.680
Come on, Smitty, you stay with me.
Let's go. We gotta move.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.475
- Hey!
- Yeah.

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.960
Help me get him down.
Help me get him down.

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.520
Yeah.

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.034
Come on, let's move. Come on.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:15.077
Can't help him, buddy, he's gone.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.470
- No.
- Come on! We gotta get outta here!

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:18.875
Let's go!

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.920
Come on, let's go.

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.793
Come on. Everyone.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.280
Off the ridge!

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.437
What is it you want of me?

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.114
I don't understand.

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:32.079
I can't hear you.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.836
Medic, help me! Help me!

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.639
Help me!

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.113
Help me, Lord.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:45.759
All right.

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.238
You're in good hands. Easy does it. Easy.

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.118
...six... eight...

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.960
Fourteen.

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.599
Get these men secured immediately.

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:14.830
Yes, sir.

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:19.551
- Private Ford, how many?
- Thirty-two only came down, sir.

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.194
- Good Lord.
- Let's go!

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.997
- Let's load 'em up.
- Yes, sir.

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:06.389
Harry. It's Desmond.

01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:10.036
We going to fix you up.
You just got to keep breathing. Okay?

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.074
- Colonel wants to see you, sir.
- I need your jeep.

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.675
You two stay here, keep watch,
keep your eyes peeled for Japs.

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:18.319
- No, but...
- Stay here! Keep watch.

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:19.675
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:31.479
Help. Help me.

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.917
Watch out. I got you.

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.591
Put your hand on it. Keep pressure on it.

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:44.189
- I'm comin' back. Okay?
- Okay.

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.873
Easy, fellas, easy.

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.235
Here we go.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.559
Okay, guys, let's go.
On the count of three. One, two, three.

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.991
Help, medic over here!

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.320
It's okay, buddy, hold it together.

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.032
We're at the edge, Eric.

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.919
You just sit tight, okay?

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.880
You're okay, Eric. You're okay, buddy.

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.991
Son of a gun, this is going to work.

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.037
One for each leg, Eric.

01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:00.113
We're going to get you dressed up
in a jiffy and get you down.

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:01.953
I got you.

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.358
I got you now, Eric.

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:08.353
You have to trust me now, Eric.
You're gonna have to trust me.

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:38.275
Japs!

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:41.512
Hold on, one of ours.
Hold on! Let's go, let's go!

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.598
I got you. I got you. I got you.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:50.430
Come on, I got you.
You're okay. You're okay.

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:57.310
Hank, another one.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.036
Colonel, call off the artillery
attack on Hacksaw.

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.511
Couldn't call it in. There's still
over 100 men left up there.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.910
Tell them to call off
the artillery on Hacksaw.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.349
Sit down, Jack. I'll get you a drink.

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.439
We just lost our cover.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.276
They're stirrin', we got to move. Come on.

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:43.150
About time.
They just keep coming by the...

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:45.880
- OK, OK. Pick it up.
- I got this.

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:25.514
Doss. Doss.

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:29.958
Help. Help me.

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:45.354
You're gonna have to trust me.
Take a breath.

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.953
Let's go, buddy. Let's go.

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:52.040
Jack, you don't know
if your men up there are dead or alive.

01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:54.396
You can't go back up there
without reinforcements.

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.516
You'll end up killing the rest of them.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.590
Then give me the reinforcements.

01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.435
I don't have any fresh men, okay?
I don't have any troops.

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.591
Three battalions got wiped out today.

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:05.354
It'll take more than a day
to get men in here.

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.079
I need them faster than that.

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:01.719
It's okay, it's okay.

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:03.314
It's all right. It's all right.

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:05.554
Everything's okay.

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.399
Morphine. It's good.

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.911
Shh.

01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:05.159
Pinnick, Pinnick. Pinnick. It's Doss.

01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:08.790
It's Doss. Be quiet. Be quiet. I got you.

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:11.873
- Are you hit?
- Yeah. I can't see.

01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:14.270
Be quiet. Just be quiet.

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:21.632
Hold still now. I got you. Hold tight.

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:24.440
There you go. Try now. Try now.

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:30.318
I thought I was blind!

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.790
Shh... Keep it down. Can you walk?

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.240
I don't know.

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.198
We got to get out of here, okay? Come on.

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:52.355
Good. Okay, we got you.

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:53.709
We got you.

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.233
Hey, Ted.

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:12.677
It's me, it's Desmond.
I'm gonna fix you up.

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:17.598
- You ready to get out of here?
- Sure am.

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.439
Please, Lord, help me get one more.

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.193
Help me get one more.

01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:08.759
Please, help me get one more.

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:30.839
One more. Help me get one more.

01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:47.239
One more. Help me get one more.

01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:51.714
One more.

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:54.834
Coming through.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.353
Where the hell are these guys coming from?

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.630
From Hacksaw.

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:03.440
- I thought they pulled out.
- Not all of them.

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:06.433
Some nut's up there
dragging wounded from the top.

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:09.274
Even lowered a couple of Japs.

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:12.478
They didn't make it.
Back with you directly.

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:16.272
Easy, easy. All set, move out.

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:49.997
Get in here. There's Nips everywhere.

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:55.270
Son of a bitch. Private Corn Stalk.

01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.397
You are nothing if not full of surprises.

01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.312
You want some morphine?

01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:03.189
- Hell, yes. That or a bullet.
- Okay.

01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.511
There. There you go.

01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:12.551
All right, let me see. Let me see.

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:15.514
How's this doing? Okay, not bad.

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.277
Let me see.

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.874
It looks much worse than it is.

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.713
Girls will still want to kiss you.

01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:27.598
Sarge, you okay here for a while?

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:29.876
Yeah, fine. Get out of here.

01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:31.599
I'm coming back.

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:33.797
You ready? Let's go. You and me, come on.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.155
Captain. There's something you gotta see.

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.236
Our guys have been
coming down in droves all night.

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:18.676
And Hollywood's here.
I never thought I'd see that guy again.

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:20.399
Come on, follow me. He's right here.

01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:26.357
What the hell is this?

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:27.920
How you doing, sir?

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.354
Hey, Cap.

01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:30.590
Captain.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.959
- It's good to see you, kid.
- Captain Glover, sir.

01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:37.394
How'd you get down, son?

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.473
Doss. Howell's still up there.

01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:43.035
What, Howell and Doss did this?

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:45.157
Mostly just Doss.

01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:47.038
- Just Doss?
- Just Doss.

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:49.589
Yeah, Doss, the coward.

01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:08.912
- You're like gum on a shoe, ain't you?
- Give me this.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.390
It's a bit late for target
practice now, don't you think?

01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:17.597
- Jump on it.
- You're kidding.

01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:19.478
No, I'm going to drag you.

01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:25.590
Let's do it.

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:29.509
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:30.590
Let's go.

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:36.960
We got company.

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:38.599
Come on.

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:00.554
Arms up.

01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:03.479
You gotta be kidding me, Corn Stalk.

01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:05.392
"You're tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra."

01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.433
Come on.

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:12.315
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:13.675
Get on.

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:42.676
- Put me down!
- Yes, Sarge.

01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:45.320
- Sergeant Howell.
- Doss is still up there.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.310
- What the hell?
- He's got Japs on his tail.

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:22.549
We got him.

01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:24.438
That's good. That's good.

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:26.512
It's okay, we got him.

01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:33.033
Whoa, whoa...

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.919
- It's okay, Doss.
- Come on, Doss, come on.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.674
- You're safe.
- Come on, Doss.

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:57.435
Desmond, it's all right, it's all right.

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:00.200
Desmond.

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:05.273
Easy, easy. Here, come on.

01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:12.680
Are you wounded?

01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:15.672
Mmm...

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:19.078
No. No.

01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:24.280
Let's get this soldier
to a hospital tent, right now.

01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:26.829
- Come on, easy now.
- Easy, easy.

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.149
Make some space.

02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.955
We need someone
to come and clean up in here.

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:17.514
Where's Irv?

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:20.399
- Irv? You mean, Schecter the medic?
- Yeah.

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:23.678
He didn't make it.
He died of shock. No plasma.

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:26.556
Sorry.

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:05.357
All I saw was a skinny kid.
I didn't know who you were.

02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:12.078
You've done more than
any other man could have done

02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:14.556
in the service of his country.

02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:17.155
And I have never been more wrong
about someone in my life.

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:20.752
I hope one day you can forgive me.

02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:35.597
We have to go back up tomorrow.

02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:40.960
I realize that tomorrow is your Sabbath.

02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:49.550
Most of these men
don't believe the same way you do.

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:55.793
But they believe so much
in how much you believe.

02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:01.839
And what you did on that ridge,
it's nothing short of a miracle,

02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:03.679
and they want a piece of it.

02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:08.671
And they're not going
to go up there without you.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.719
<i>What the hell is your delay, Captain?</i>

02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:23.553
<i>You were supposed to begin</i>
<i>that assault 10 minutes ago!</i>

02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:26.439
- We're waiting, sir.
- Waiting for what?

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.914
For Private Doss
to finish praying for us, sir.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.639
<i>Private Doss is praying for you?</i>

02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:35.518
<i>Who the hell is Private Doss?</i>

02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.509
Let's go to work.

02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:54.312
Down. Get down!

02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:57.757
Get on the ground. On the ground. Now!

02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:39.357
Lay down, lay down. I got the morphine.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.912
Let's go, let's get these men out of here.

02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:52.674
My Bible... My Bible. My Bible...

02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:55.514
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop!

02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:58.115
My Bible, my Bible, my Bible.

02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:00.076
Okay.

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:19.394
You're going home, Desmond.
We've taken Hacksaw.

02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.716
Hold up, hold up! Desmond!

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:28.990
Desmond.

02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:19.038
<i>I was praying the whole time.</i>

02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:24.354
I just kept praying,
"Lord, please help me get one more."

02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:29.560
When I got this, I said,
"Lord, please help me get one more."

02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:38.075
<i>I would say anyone is wrong</i>

02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:40.117
<i>to try to compromise</i>
<i>somebody's conviction.</i>

02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:43.318
I don't care whether
it's army or what it is.

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:47.792
When you own a conviction,
that is not a joke.

02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.839
That's what you are.

02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.551
<i>Even though I said those things to him</i>

02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:55.909
<i>in regard to carrying a rifle,</i>

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:02.600
then he would never be by my
damn side at all unless he had a rifle.

02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:05.559
<i>But then, in the long run,</i>

02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:10.351
<i>finding out that he was one</i>
<i>of the bravest persons alive.</i>

02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:13.194
And then to have him end up saving my life

02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:16.432
was the irony of the whole thing.

02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:21.595
Blood had run down
into the fella's face and eyes.

02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:25.720
He was laying there just
groaning and calling for a medic.

02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:34.072
I took water from my canteen,
got some bandage, and I washed his face.

02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:38.996
And when I... was washing his eyes,
his eyes came open.

02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:42.756
Man, he just lit up.

02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:47.794
He says, "I thought I was blind."

02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:50.952
And if I hadn't got anything
more out of the war

02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:55.876
than that smile he gave me,
I'd have been well repaid.
