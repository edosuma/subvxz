MAKING MOVIES
PRESENTS

00:17.268 --> 00:20.271
All right, you're in control.
You're the leader.

00:20.772 --> 00:23.274
The pony has no say.
You're in command.

00:26.861 --> 00:33.451
Half-halt. Look forward.
Rhythm. Straight towards the jump.

00:33.618 --> 00:35.954
Go ahead. Yep. Yep.

00:37.372 --> 00:38.998
Svante!

00:39.707 --> 00:41.751
Easy, easy.

00:42.168 --> 00:44.837
What's the matter
with our pony today?

00:46.631 --> 00:48.758
Try again right away.

00:50.426 --> 00:53.054
Did you hurt yourself?
- My arm hurts a little.

00:53.179 --> 00:57.642
Go ahead and try it again.
That's it.

01:00.019 --> 01:02.981
I'll take down the top pole.

01:03.147 --> 01:05.608
The main thing is
that you get him over.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.819
You can come in in a trot.

01:11.114 --> 01:13.074
Go ahead and jump.

01:17.328 --> 01:21.291
Yes. Good job, Varpu. Pat Svante.

01:21.791 --> 01:25.837
Saara, I still can't believe you're
getting a pony for your birthday!

01:25.962 --> 01:27.589
This is so cute.

01:27.714 --> 01:29.966
Have you decided
who the groom will be?

01:30.091 --> 01:32.885
I don't know yet. We'll see.
- Take me. - Take me.

01:33.094 --> 01:36.264
My parents said they'll
consider buying me a horse -

01:36.389 --> 01:40.435
when I go to high school.
In high school I'll be a has-been.

01:40.602 --> 01:44.439
A fat-ass Sunday rider.
- "A fat-ass Sunday rider."

01:44.606 --> 01:47.442
Seriously. If you want
to make it to the top, -

01:47.567 --> 01:49.736
the classes alone won't...

01:49.902 --> 01:52.447
Varpu, my dad's here.
You want a ride?

01:52.614 --> 01:55.742
I don't want you to have to drive
all the way to my house.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.411
It's no trouble at all.

01:58.578 --> 02:03.916
How do you pronounce "Ivanhoe"?
- It's a cool name.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.002
I don't know. I call him Imppu.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.547
Hey, little onion.
- Hi.

02:09.714 --> 02:11.966
You got all your stuff?
- I think so.

02:12.133 --> 02:16.179
You sure? - Yeah. This is
the last time I'm taking the bus -

02:16.346 --> 02:19.098
before my mom
gets her driver's license.

02:20.642 --> 02:23.061
Turn right
at the next intersection.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.637
Bye. See you next week!
- Bye!

02:57.845 --> 03:02.642
You always say your mom is
going get her driver's license, -

03:02.809 --> 03:07.313
but can't your dad come get you?
- He really can't.

03:09.941 --> 03:11.901
What do your mom and dad do?

03:12.151 --> 03:15.488
My mom is a translator,
and my dad is... an actor.

03:16.447 --> 03:19.117
Someone famous?
Do I know him?

03:19.325 --> 03:21.828
Can I have his autograph?
just kidding!

03:23.454 --> 03:28.167
You probably don't know him
because he's not on TV or anything.

03:28.418 --> 03:32.171
Is your dad coming to see
the competition? - I'm not sure.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.257
My parents were, like, -

03:34.424 --> 03:37.468
"We're gonna come see
the competition."

03:37.593 --> 03:39.220
I was, like, "Okay."

03:39.345 --> 03:42.265
My parents are also coming,
which is nice. I guess.

03:42.390 --> 03:46.018
I'm freezing. I wanna go home.
- When is your mom picking you up?

04:01.909 --> 04:09.625
LITTLE WING

05:06.057 --> 05:07.683
That's Varpu!

05:07.975 --> 05:09.602
Hi, Varpu!

05:09.727 --> 05:12.438
Varpu! Nice sex pants.

05:13.564 --> 05:16.025
Why are you so wet?
- It rained.

05:16.234 --> 05:19.403
Wanna hang out? We'll
probably go for a drive. - Not now.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.323
Anttu's coming.
- Not now.

05:22.532 --> 05:24.951
You're such a goody-goody.
I love you.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.206
Hi.
- Hi. - Hi, Varpu!

05:32.583 --> 05:34.710
Anttu, why is your face so red?

Hi.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.075
Hi.

06:15.543 --> 06:19.964
Well?
- I didn't pass.

06:20.256 --> 06:22.508
Still?
- No.

06:23.426 --> 06:27.138
How many times
have you tried now? - Three.

06:27.388 --> 06:29.015
Mom.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.314
I have to take
ten more driving lessons.

06:36.689 --> 06:39.525
All my money and savings
will go towards it.

06:41.694 --> 06:47.909
I can skip the riding camp.
- No. You're not skipping anything.

06:50.912 --> 06:56.250
How was your jumping class?
- Bad. Svante refused to jump...

06:56.417 --> 06:59.086
I'm starting to think
Asko is really a sadist.

06:59.462 --> 07:02.548
He enjoys me panicking
behind the wheel.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.760
Why don't you switch
to another driving instructor?

07:08.846 --> 07:10.473
Varpu.

07:13.017 --> 07:14.644
Varpu.

07:15.937 --> 07:17.772
Varpu, are you asleep?

07:26.781 --> 07:28.658
Mom.

07:29.492 --> 07:33.829
What's the matter?
- I can't sleep.

07:34.956 --> 07:37.875
Why don't you have
a glass of milk and a banana.

07:45.091 --> 07:47.343
Can I sleep in your bed?

08:01.774 --> 08:05.903
My weasel boss called and said
the client's vacuum is broken, -

08:06.195 --> 08:09.281
so she asked me to go get
the company's vacuum.

08:09.448 --> 08:12.910
Fuck, I really wish I had a car.
I'd get more work too.

08:28.009 --> 08:29.677
Here.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.679
I love you, pumpkin.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.183
Have a nice day!

08:37.393 --> 08:39.395
Mom, you forgot your phone!
- Oh.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.941
Thanks. All right.

08:47.987 --> 08:49.613
Bye.

08:50.281 --> 08:52.033
Bye.

08:54.994 --> 08:57.329
HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!

09:00.624 --> 09:03.836
Are you going to give it
to your dad? - Maybe.

09:05.463 --> 09:07.339
What are you going to write on it?

09:07.506 --> 09:09.759
Happy Father's Day!
Love, Varpu.

09:10.468 --> 09:13.387
Aren't you going to write a poem?
- No.

09:14.388 --> 09:18.017
The only thing I can think of
is something like, -

09:18.184 --> 09:21.145
"Dad, you're always warm
and sunny."

09:21.312 --> 09:23.939
Even though you have no money.
- Or honey.

09:24.106 --> 09:27.276
And getting shit-faced
makes you act all funny. - What?

09:27.443 --> 09:29.278
Anttu always says it.

09:29.612 --> 09:34.325
"I was so shit-faced."
"We got totally shit-faced."

09:34.742 --> 09:36.994
No fun with honey.
- Ha-ha.

09:37.161 --> 09:38.788
Oh, Anttu.

09:40.331 --> 09:43.876
You have to tick the box
that says "nonsmoker."

09:44.543 --> 09:48.964
Should I write,
"Man Wanted for Christmas"?

09:49.840 --> 09:52.468
You mean a Christmas clown?
- You remember?

09:52.635 --> 09:56.931
Sure. - You used to call Santa's
helpers Christmas clowns.

09:57.223 --> 10:02.394
Okay, so it'll be
"Christmas Clown Wanted...

10:02.603 --> 10:05.523
Varpu.
- ...for Christmas."

10:05.773 --> 10:12.530
No. Why don't you write...

10:13.781 --> 10:16.700
"Sensitive on the Outside,
Strong on the Inside."

10:17.493 --> 10:19.370
Or does that sound awful?
- Yes.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.123
You're not helping at all.

10:23.874 --> 10:28.212
Maybe you can finish it
on your own. - Yeah.

10:49.066 --> 10:53.362
Where does my dad live?
What does he do?

10:56.490 --> 10:58.242
I guess he lives in Oulu.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.121
He'd never move away
from there. - Okay.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.761
Does this sound okay?
"I have an MA, -

11:17.928 --> 11:21.515
and at the moment I'm looking for
opportunities in my field."

11:21.640 --> 11:23.475
"After years of being single, -

11:23.642 --> 11:27.396
I'm more than ready to welcome
a man in my life, long term."

11:28.105 --> 11:30.024
Maybe take out "long term"?

11:33.068 --> 11:34.820
Okay.

11:35.321 --> 11:37.907
"Books and literature
are important to me, -

11:38.073 --> 11:41.619
and languages have always
fascinated me. I like to travel, -

11:41.785 --> 11:44.955
although I haven't much
due to circumstances."

11:45.122 --> 11:48.334
"I'm also a single mother
of an eleven-year-old girl."

11:48.751 --> 11:51.378
Does this sound a bit serious?
- Mom.

11:51.545 --> 11:56.592
Please give me feedback. This is
difficult. - Do I look like my dad?

11:57.343 --> 12:02.932
What? I'll just post it like this.
For better or worse.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.479
Now it's on the website.

12:25.579 --> 12:29.500
"Varpu Vanamo raspberry nose,
teeny weeny toffee toes, -

12:29.667 --> 12:31.585
pulls a fluffy puffy pose."

12:34.630 --> 12:37.883
Do the initials I.H. mean Ilmari?

12:38.384 --> 12:41.887
Ilmari who?
- My dad.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.683
His last name isn't Miettinen
like ours?

12:47.810 --> 12:50.896
His last name is Hukkanen.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.693
Why do you ask?

12:57.695 --> 13:03.200
You want to see him? - No.
It would be so awkward.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.433
<i>Directory assistance-
<i>How may I help you?</i> - Hi.</i>

13:27.599 --> 13:32.604
I'd like to have the address
for a person named Ilmari Hukkanen.

13:33.355 --> 13:38.861
<i>Do you know where he lives?</i>
- Oulu.

13:59.840 --> 14:05.387
If I get nervous, Svante
gets nervous and wonâ€™t jump.

14:05.554 --> 14:08.265
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

14:08.432 --> 14:11.310
Can we talk about
something other than horses?

14:11.477 --> 14:14.396
Like what?
- I don't know.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.571
Want to check those out?
- Okay.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.074
Varpu, come.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.693
Yes!

15:31.140 --> 15:34.476
Where did you learn to drive?
- My stepdad taught me.

15:34.643 --> 15:38.021
We drive at his summerhouse.
- That's so cool.

15:49.366 --> 15:53.495
Today's my birthday.
- Did you turn twelve?

15:54.621 --> 15:56.707
Happy birthday.

15:57.332 --> 16:00.586
Happy birthday, Varpu Baby!
- Stop. You'll ruin my hair.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.671
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

16:04.965 --> 16:06.800
You want to drive?

16:10.095 --> 16:12.264
Really?
- Yeah yeah.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.892
Okay, now I'm scared.

16:16.226 --> 16:20.731
Put your left foot on the clutch.
Right foot on the brake.

16:20.898 --> 16:24.359
Make sure it's in first gear. Good.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.864
That's the sound of the engine.

16:29.114 --> 16:32.659
Move your right foot to the gas,
which is on the right.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.996
Slowly start lifting
your foot off the clutch.

16:36.163 --> 16:39.791
Step on the gas lightly. Okay.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.586
Oh my God.
- That's it. Damn good.

16:42.753 --> 16:47.299
Lift you left foot
totally off the clutch.

16:47.925 --> 16:50.302
I mean, step on the gas.

16:50.886 --> 16:54.014
Anttu, get it together.
- Stop that.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.731
Turn the wheel. Turn!

17:05.150 --> 17:07.736
Damn good job!
Girl, you're driving a car!

17:07.903 --> 17:09.570
Can we stop?

17:09.738 --> 17:12.866
Varpu, how are you feeling?
- Good.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.953
I wanna go faster.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.829
I want to get the fuck out of here.
- Enough.

17:18.997 --> 17:23.460
I want out.
- Shut up in the backseat.

17:23.961 --> 17:25.963
Step on the gas.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.343
Go ahead, towards the jump.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.846
Straight to the oxer.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.767
<i>Good job.</i>

17:39.726 --> 17:43.188
Bring back the rhythm
and canter again. Good.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.950
Yes. Excellent rhythm.
Great job looking straight ahead.

17:55.075 --> 17:59.746
With that precision,
the competition will go well.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.000
Next is Saara and Ivanhoe.

18:03.166 --> 18:08.171
Svante sweetie.
This pony is the best.

18:08.505 --> 18:11.550
I miss competing with him.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.970
I must've won like ten rosettes
thanks to him.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.807
My chubby, bouncy pony baby.

18:18.974 --> 18:23.854
Varpu, when's your mom getting
her driver's license? - Soon.

18:24.021 --> 18:26.481
I googled your dad's name, -

18:26.690 --> 18:31.820
but I didn't find any actors
with that name.

18:32.029 --> 18:35.782
I forgot he uses a stage name.

18:36.033 --> 18:40.704
What's that? - He uses a different
name at work in the theater.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.290
Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

18:44.041 --> 18:47.502
We were wondering if it's a trend
in Eastern Helsinki -

18:47.669 --> 18:50.422
for sixth graders
to wear little kids' clothes.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.842
Okay, whatever. Let's go.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.399
Hi.
- Hi.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.486
Hi, Varpu.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.954
Bo, this is Varpu. Bo, Varpu.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.170
Come say hi.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.635
Hi.
- Hi.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.514
We had coffee,
and then I invited Bo over.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.519
Please sit with us.

19:50.649 --> 19:54.736
I'm so excited. I've been telling
Bo about my new driving instructor.

19:54.903 --> 19:57.406
His name is Kari. He's so sweet.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.616
I learned more today with him -

19:59.783 --> 20:02.536
than I have with that dickhead
all fall. - See?

20:05.872 --> 20:11.128
I hear you ride horses?
- Yeah.

20:11.837 --> 20:17.175
I have a little girl
who rides ponies. This tall.

20:17.718 --> 20:20.011
Maija, seven years old.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.140
I need to buy her
new hobbyhorses all the time.

20:23.849 --> 20:26.351
Yeah, I went through
that phase too.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.897
We have Milli, -

20:32.357 --> 20:37.988
Misty, Lightning. And what
was the name of the last one...

20:39.072 --> 20:44.327
Hero in His Heart, Hero for short.
That's a stallion.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.508
Varpu is already eleven.

20:59.050 --> 21:02.345
It's shocking. It's like she was
just a fetus yesterday.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.974
I'd like to see you tomorrow.
- Oh.

21:11.605 --> 21:16.067
But I'll keep in mind what you said
about taking baby steps.

21:16.902 --> 21:19.237
Yeah. I had a good time.
- So did I.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.240
Bye.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.079
Bye, Varpu.
- Bye.

21:38.507 --> 21:41.009
Well, what did you think?

21:42.719 --> 21:46.973
I think he's sweet because
he's so polite in a genuine way.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.309
I get the feeling
he appreciates me.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.689
But I was thinking, does he
kinda appreciate me too much -

21:54.856 --> 21:56.858
and apologize all the time?

21:57.025 --> 22:01.071
Mom.
- just say it.

22:01.238 --> 22:04.866
This is something that will have
an effect on your life as well.

22:05.033 --> 22:09.830
I just wanted to say...
that I'm not eleven anymore.

22:15.460 --> 22:18.588
Today's your birthday.
- Mom, c'mon.

22:18.797 --> 22:23.802
How could I forget.
- It was actually yesterday.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.723
Why didn't you say anything?

22:30.892 --> 22:33.478
You promised to buy me
a new phone.

22:36.231 --> 22:38.316
I don't have money for it.

22:41.862 --> 22:43.697
I'm sorry.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.329
Happy birthday, honey.

22:52.873 --> 22:57.210
I'm sorry for being like this.
- That's okay.

22:58.003 --> 23:04.134
I'm sorry for forgetting.
- That's okay.

23:12.601 --> 23:14.227
There you go.

23:16.271 --> 23:19.774
This is not good.
- It's too big.

23:30.535 --> 23:34.164
What?
- Look.

23:35.874 --> 23:38.376
That's the third text
I got from Bo today.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.549
C'mon, say
what you really think of him.

23:44.799 --> 23:50.013
What does it matter?
- "What does it matter?"

23:50.889 --> 23:52.807
Say something.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.228
It's awful
when you don't say anything.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.528
Well, he's a bit of a wuss.

24:06.780 --> 24:12.077
And ugly. Don't you think?
- Well, yeah.

24:13.495 --> 24:18.750
His name is Bo.
just think about it. Bo.

24:27.801 --> 24:33.390
Did you hear when Varpu said
her dad uses a stage name?

24:33.682 --> 24:36.810
I was like,
"What the heck is that?"

24:37.060 --> 24:41.690
Did she think we wouldn't find out
her dad's not an actor?

24:56.413 --> 24:58.206
Hi, Mom.

25:13.013 --> 25:15.015
Mom?

25:37.871 --> 25:39.664
Mom.

25:42.459 --> 25:44.127
Mom, what's the matter?

25:46.171 --> 25:48.173
I failed my driving test again.

25:48.673 --> 25:52.969
Maybe you're not meant to
drive a car. Give up already.

25:53.094 --> 25:55.346
Then I broke up with Bo.

25:55.889 --> 25:58.516
Why?
- I don't know.

25:59.559 --> 26:02.062
I'm pissed that he let me
dump him like that.

26:02.270 --> 26:04.064
He should've stopped me.

26:04.355 --> 26:10.820
He was like this. Like a sheep.
Fuck. Annoying.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.782
Then why did you dump him?

26:15.533 --> 26:19.037
Didn't you say
he was a wuss and ugly?

27:08.628 --> 27:13.007
Want to hang out now?

27:43.496 --> 27:47.292
This is a cool Saab. - No kidding.
It's got a subwoofer.

27:47.625 --> 27:50.587
Check out the stereo.
- Can I drive?

28:12.775 --> 28:14.736
Watch out! Bicycle!

28:52.148 --> 28:54.776
You're really lovely.
- You too.

29:00.281 --> 29:03.493
Are you cold? I can warm you.

29:22.637 --> 29:24.264
Don't.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.143
Why?

29:29.769 --> 29:32.730
I don't want to.
- What do you mean?

29:32.855 --> 29:35.316
You don't even know
what I was going to do.

29:35.483 --> 29:40.989
I thought you liked me.
- I do.

29:41.155 --> 29:45.159
Then why did you ask me
for a drive? - just because.

29:45.326 --> 29:49.330
Just because? Fuck.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.416
Fuck women.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.752
I'm tired. I'm going home.

29:55.586 --> 29:58.756
I can take you.
- That's okay.

32:51.679 --> 32:54.348
Hello, I'd like to get
driving instructions -

32:54.515 --> 32:57.018
on how to get
from Janakkala to Oulu.

32:59.312 --> 33:01.522
I'm on Road 3.

33:05.067 --> 33:08.029
Yeah. Road 4?

33:09.697 --> 33:11.365
Yeah.

33:12.450 --> 33:14.118
Thanks.

33:14.577 --> 33:18.164
Oh, one more thing.
How long is the drive?

33:20.541 --> 33:22.710
How long is the drive?

33:23.503 --> 33:25.880
Hello? Hello?

34:19.891 --> 34:23.478
<i>Southwest winds,</i>
<i>16 meters per second.</i>

34:23.771 --> 34:27.525
<i>Eastern part of the Northern Baltic</i>
<i>Sea and the Archipelago Sea:</i>

34:27.650 --> 34:30.652
<i>south-southwestern winds,</i>
<i>14 meters per second.</i>

34:31.070 --> 34:33.656
<i>We have a high wind warning...</i>

35:51.233 --> 35:54.403
<i>Wake up, Mom.</i>
<i>Don't hit that snooze button.</i>

35:54.570 --> 35:57.073
<i>Wake up, Mom.</i>
<i>Don't hit that snooze button.</i>

35:57.365 --> 36:00.076
<i>Wake up, Mom.
Don't hit that snooze button.</i>

36:00.409 --> 36:02.953
<i>Wake up, Mom.</i>
<i>Don't hit that snooze button.</i>

37:47.808 --> 37:51.896
Where are you off to at this hour?
- I'm going to Oulu.

37:52.104 --> 37:55.149
That's where I'm headed. Hop in.

38:00.446 --> 38:03.991
Hi, I'm Markku.
- Noora.

38:04.241 --> 38:06.786
What's a young girl like you
doing out here -

38:06.952 --> 38:11.081
hitchhiking at this hour? - I had
an argument with my boyfriend.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.334
So I left.

38:13.501 --> 38:17.546
Do your parents know you're
out here hitchhiking? - Yeah.

38:17.797 --> 38:20.299
How old are you?
- Fifteen.

38:36.857 --> 38:38.651
Siru Miettinen.

38:38.818 --> 38:44.156
<i>I got your text about Varpu</i>
<i>and thought I'd call right away.</i>

38:44.406 --> 38:48.744
<i>We're halfway through the math</i>
<i>lesson, and she's still not here.</i>

38:49.078 --> 38:50.746
What?

38:59.755 --> 39:01.882
This is Siru Miettinen.

39:02.258 --> 39:05.970
My child is missing.
She left home yesterday.

39:07.179 --> 39:11.934
At night when I was asleep.
Or in the morning before I woke up.

39:17.648 --> 39:20.067
Varpu Miettinen.

39:20.693 --> 39:22.736
Twenty-two.

39:24.280 --> 39:30.536
Twenty. And eighteen.

39:33.414 --> 39:36.000
Noora, wake up.

39:36.208 --> 39:40.296
Noora, we're here.
Is this your dad's house?

39:40.588 --> 39:42.464
Did I sleep?
- Yeah.

39:43.132 --> 39:47.219
Yeah, this is it. Thanks a lot.

39:47.636 --> 39:50.890
No problem. You sure
everything's okay? - Yeah.

39:51.265 --> 39:56.812
Thanks so much.
- Take care.

39:56.979 --> 40:02.401
You might want to consider getting
a new boyfriend. - Yeah. Thanks.

40:43.484 --> 40:45.986
Hello.
- Hi.

40:46.153 --> 40:50.991
Does Ilmari Hukkanen live here?
- He just left for work.

40:51.492 --> 40:56.455
He'll be back in the evening.
You want me to give him a message?

40:56.956 --> 41:01.293
Where does he work?
You think I could see him there?

41:02.044 --> 41:07.132
May I ask what you want?
Why do you want to see him?

41:08.801 --> 41:10.594
I'm his daughter.

41:17.476 --> 41:20.437
How old are you?
- Twelve.

41:24.650 --> 41:27.444
So where does he work?

41:48.674 --> 41:50.300
Hi, it's Minna.

41:50.634 --> 41:55.139
Listen, I have a young lady here
to see you, Varpu Miettinen.

41:55.472 --> 41:57.933
You want to meet her later?

42:00.144 --> 42:04.940
Yeah. She said
you'd set a meeting for today.

42:06.316 --> 42:10.487
She's really young.
- Tell him I'm his daughter.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.239
Just a moment.

42:12.364 --> 42:14.950
What did you say?
- Tell him I'm his daughter.

42:15.409 --> 42:17.661
She's your daughter.

42:19.455 --> 42:24.001
Oh. Yeah.

42:24.293 --> 42:28.505
Okay. Okay. Bye.

42:33.177 --> 42:37.765
Ilmari said he's very sorry,
but he's too busy to see you.

42:39.183 --> 42:42.352
I don't really know
how I could help you.

42:44.313 --> 42:46.190
That's okay.

43:29.942 --> 43:31.568
Hi.

43:36.281 --> 43:38.200
What is it?

43:39.201 --> 43:43.705
I thought that... I thought
you didn't like me anymore.

43:45.165 --> 43:47.084
Varpu is missing.

43:47.543 --> 43:50.796
The police have been looking
for her for five hours.

43:56.009 --> 43:59.012
Can you call me
if you hear from her?

44:04.935 --> 44:06.562
Thanks.

44:07.312 --> 44:11.358
No one has seen her.
Not even people at the stables.

44:20.659 --> 44:25.497
My little girl.
What's happened to her?

44:31.295 --> 44:34.840
I thought about giving her up
for adoption when she was born.

44:35.007 --> 44:37.926
I thought I wouldn't be able
to take care of her.

44:40.596 --> 44:42.764
But I couldn't give her away.

44:44.766 --> 44:47.978
She was so sweet and wise
right from the start.

44:59.907 --> 45:03.577
Now she's dying
or suffering somewhere -

45:03.702 --> 45:06.246
because I'm so fucking retarded.

45:13.921 --> 45:15.714
We'll find her.

45:26.808 --> 45:34.233
You again.
- Could I wait inside for Ilmari?

45:34.399 --> 45:36.735
He was too busy to meet me.

45:36.985 --> 45:41.031
Does your mother know you're here?
- Yeah.

45:44.660 --> 45:46.495
I tried to call you.

45:47.621 --> 45:50.540
I just wanted to know
when you're coming home.

45:50.707 --> 45:53.085
I made this osso buco-style stew.

45:53.502 --> 45:56.213
It's not that. Don't get upset.

45:57.464 --> 46:01.343
Yes. Yeah yeah.

46:01.969 --> 46:06.431
Right. You're right.

46:07.224 --> 46:10.644
Come when you can... Hello?

46:17.359 --> 46:23.323
Ilmari is a bit of a... tornado.

46:28.453 --> 46:30.539
Are you hungry?
- A little.

46:30.706 --> 46:34.167
I'm really hungry. Let's eat.

46:34.334 --> 46:36.962
Can I go to the bathroom?
- Of course.

48:03.131 --> 48:08.929
Ilmari must've been twenty-three
when you were born. - Yeah.

48:12.766 --> 48:17.646
It's strange that he never
told me about you.

48:18.438 --> 48:23.276
My mom hasn't talked about him
that much either.

48:23.443 --> 48:25.404
I guess there was some drama.

48:25.570 --> 48:28.448
And then he kinda went on
with his life. - Yeah.

48:31.743 --> 48:33.620
What happened to your lip?

48:34.037 --> 48:37.958
A horse got spooked by a tractor.

48:39.209 --> 48:43.713
He hit his head into mine like this
and then stepped on my foot.

48:45.090 --> 48:47.676
I'm glad nothing happened
to the baby.

48:48.218 --> 48:51.721
You have a horse?
- I'm renting one.

48:52.013 --> 48:54.182
Mare or gelding?
- Gelding.

48:54.391 --> 48:57.269
Geldings are the best. What breed?

48:59.396 --> 49:01.064
He's home.

49:28.091 --> 49:31.136
Sorry, I bought this
because I want to eat right away.

49:31.303 --> 49:33.805
It's fine. We can have
the stew tomorrow.

49:35.432 --> 49:37.559
Have you eaten fish?

49:37.893 --> 49:40.061
Ilmari, we have a guest.

49:40.896 --> 49:45.567
This is Varpu. She's twelve.

49:50.489 --> 49:52.157
Hello.
- Hi.

49:56.203 --> 50:03.001
Is she someone you know?
- Varpu said she's your daughter.

50:07.464 --> 50:12.302
Oh. Did you visit my office today?
- Yes.

50:13.345 --> 50:17.349
Okay. May I ask where you got
the idea I'm your dad?

50:17.891 --> 50:24.689
My dad's name is Ilmari Hukkanen,
and he lives in Oulu. - Okay.

50:25.357 --> 50:28.527
Varpu is twelve.
- You said that already.

50:32.572 --> 50:35.742
What's your mom's name?
- Siru Miettinen.

50:37.118 --> 50:42.123
Siru Miettinen.
Doesn't ring a bell.

50:42.374 --> 50:44.834
Where were you born?
- In Oulu.

50:47.629 --> 50:51.466
I'm sorry. I'm not your father.
- Okay.

50:55.011 --> 50:59.057
Do you need a ride somewhere?
- No, it's okay.

50:59.516 --> 51:03.770
Okay. I'm sorry. Tell your mom -

51:03.937 --> 51:09.568
this might not be the best way
to handle these things. - Okay.

51:22.998 --> 51:25.542
What's going on?
- I don't know.

51:26.042 --> 51:28.336
I thought she was your daughter.

51:28.628 --> 51:31.798
You thought I had a child
I wouldn't have told you about?

51:31.965 --> 51:34.759
And you invited her to dinner
just like that?

51:34.926 --> 51:38.138
Seriously. What were you thinking?

51:39.180 --> 51:42.350
Bye!
- Bye.

51:44.227 --> 51:47.105
This was some kind
of fucking ambush.

51:47.355 --> 51:52.444
You didn't consider calling
or texting me? - But I thought...

51:52.569 --> 51:54.738
But, but, blah blah blah.

51:54.863 --> 51:57.574
You're just coming up
with excuses again.

51:57.741 --> 52:00.535
I'll go take a shower.
But we'll talk about this.

52:00.702 --> 52:02.621
This left a bad taste in my mouth.

53:20.281 --> 53:23.618
Varpu. Is everything all right?

53:24.661 --> 53:28.873
Can I give you a ride home?
- I live in Helsinki.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.586
Hop in.

53:46.099 --> 53:50.895
Siru Miettinen.
<i>- Mom, it's me, Varpu.</i>

53:51.062 --> 53:55.525
Varpu. Where are you?
Are you okay? - Yes.

53:55.692 --> 53:58.111
<i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm in Oulu.

53:59.154 --> 54:03.199
Oulu? Why are you there?
Are you at your dad's place?

54:29.225 --> 54:31.227
I'll take the first flight.

54:31.394 --> 54:33.938
I'll take one of
those quick loans and go.

54:34.105 --> 54:36.858
I can lend you the money.
- No.

54:38.485 --> 54:42.489
I can at least take you
to the airport. - Yeah.

54:47.035 --> 54:50.371
I'd like to say something nice
to you, but I don't know how.

54:55.335 --> 54:57.879
But just for your information, -

54:59.255 --> 55:02.550
I do have nice thoughts
concerning you in my head.

55:06.554 --> 55:11.893
Please accept this information
in case you find it useful.

55:25.073 --> 55:28.493
Did you run away from home too?
- Yeah.

55:31.788 --> 55:33.623
Are you going back?

55:35.959 --> 55:37.585
I don't know.

55:40.964 --> 55:42.841
Where are you going to move?

55:47.262 --> 55:49.013
I don't know.

55:54.394 --> 55:57.730
When will your baby be born?
- Anytime now.

55:58.523 --> 56:00.984
I'm due in a week.

56:09.909 --> 56:11.744
Here you are.

56:18.710 --> 56:23.006
I was supposed to take these to
the hospital when I go into labor.

56:23.172 --> 56:27.552
They're packed with
energy and good vitamins.

56:44.861 --> 56:50.992
I wanted to show you this.
Music for labor.

56:52.118 --> 56:54.537
Emilia and

56:59.125 --> 57:06.424
That's my band.
Or was. Fifteen years ago.

57:09.093 --> 57:10.887
Can we listen to it?

58:02.230 --> 58:03.898
Varpu.

58:06.526 --> 58:10.738
Hi.
- I was so worried about you.

58:11.322 --> 58:13.282
Why did you run away like that?

58:14.993 --> 58:17.203
What were you thinking?

58:17.370 --> 58:20.123
A twelve-year-old
hitchhiking alone at night.

58:20.873 --> 58:23.584
You realize how dangerous it is?

58:24.419 --> 58:28.047
You understand that I'm
really angry with you? - Yikes.

58:29.215 --> 58:33.678
Hi. Emilia Hukkanen.
- Siru Miettinen.

58:35.471 --> 58:37.306
Are you Ilmari's wife?

58:47.316 --> 58:51.529
No. He's not your dad.

58:52.613 --> 58:55.491
Where is he then?

58:55.700 --> 58:58.786
Why didn't directory assistance
give me his number?

59:00.496 --> 59:02.582
Maybe he's unlisted.

59:05.460 --> 59:12.800
Can you get his number somewhere?
- Yeah, sure.

59:17.513 --> 59:20.099
Maybe I can call his sister.

59:21.225 --> 59:26.147
You mean my aunt?
- Yeah.

59:34.822 --> 59:36.908
Well?
- What?

59:37.742 --> 59:39.452
Are you gonna call her?

01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:10.274
Are you okay?

01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:15.029
You feel sick?
Are you gonna throw up? - Maybe.

01:00:21.119 --> 01:00:23.955
You still want to go see him?
- Yeah.

01:00:29.502 --> 01:00:35.007
What if he's not home?
- We'll wait.

01:00:36.134 --> 01:00:38.928
Or we'll leave a note saying
we were here.

01:01:34.483 --> 01:01:36.194
Oh Lord.

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.655
Hi.
- Hi, Ilmari.

01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:45.703
Varpu and I decided
to come see you.

01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:47.955
Sorry for not calling beforehand, -

01:01:48.122 --> 01:01:51.542
but your sister said
you don't have a phone, so...

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:54.295
Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:55.671 --> 01:01:58.633
Are you Varpu?
- Yeah.

01:02:00.218 --> 01:02:02.845
I remember you.

01:02:05.556 --> 01:02:07.683
C'mon in.
- Sure.

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:11.103
Come on in.
- We won't stay long.

01:02:24.909 --> 01:02:26.661
All right.

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:35.211
How are things?
- The same old, I guess.

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:39.423
You've been in Oulu
the whole time? - Yeah.

01:02:39.674 --> 01:02:41.801
You can take your coats off.

01:02:46.055 --> 01:02:48.182
You haven't changed one bit.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:56.691
But you have.
You've changed so much.

01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:58.776
What's happened to you?

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:09.036
Yeah.

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:11.455
All right.

01:03:28.639 --> 01:03:30.558
Please have a seat.

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.604
There you go.

01:03:46.032 --> 01:03:48.200
You want pizza?

01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:52.955
I have pizza and coke.
I also have milk.

01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:57.585
Pizza or coke or milk?
Coke or milk?

01:03:58.127 --> 01:04:01.380
Or water? I have water, naturally.

01:04:01.672 --> 01:04:05.843
But there's meat in the pizza.
Do you eat meat?

01:04:06.385 --> 01:04:10.681
I'll have a slice of pizza and
a coke. - I'll also have a coke.

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.475
Okay.

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:31.804
All right.

01:05:33.097 --> 01:05:34.765
Here you go.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.726
Here.

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:41.522
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:05:42.064 --> 01:05:43.732
All right.

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.989
You think it's hot in here?

01:05:50.197 --> 01:05:54.910
I often get really hot here,
and I keep the door open.

01:05:55.077 --> 01:05:58.122
You mind if I open it?
- No.

01:05:58.289 --> 01:06:00.791
Will you get cold?
-just open it.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.004
Open or closed? Maybe I'll
open it for just a moment.

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:08.591
For just a moment.

01:06:11.886 --> 01:06:13.512
Yeah.

01:06:24.315 --> 01:06:29.778
Well, have you asked yourself
the same question?

01:06:30.404 --> 01:06:33.991
What question? - Have you
asked yourself how things are?

01:06:34.158 --> 01:06:36.243
Yeah, I have.

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:44.793
I'm good. There have been
times that were a bit difficult, -

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:47.087
but mostly I've been good.

01:06:47.505 --> 01:06:51.217
Well, do you have all the things
you're entitled to?

01:06:51.425 --> 01:06:54.303
Or do you have some things
you're not entitled to?

01:06:55.346 --> 01:06:59.975
Have you thought about
these kinds of things? - No.

01:07:02.978 --> 01:07:08.067
I mean I have,
but it's a big question.

01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:10.194
I don't know how to answer.

01:07:17.326 --> 01:07:22.373
I think I need a cigarette.

01:07:23.207 --> 01:07:27.503
I usually smoke in the kitchen.
You mind?

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:31.131
You can come watch me.
I mean, keep me company.

01:07:39.348 --> 01:07:41.767
Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:07:57.324 --> 01:08:03.664
You have Jimi's pictures
on the wall. - Yeah. I do.

01:08:04.039 --> 01:08:09.461
Your dad and I used to sing
his song "Little Wing."

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:15.926

01:08:21.724 --> 01:08:25.144
I used to bounce you like this
and say that.

01:08:26.854 --> 01:08:28.939
You thought it was fun.

01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:32.984
You had dark hair, but you
only had hair on the sides.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:36.238
Now you have so much hair.

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.408
How can you have that much hair?

01:08:39.867 --> 01:08:45.038
No one has that much hair.
- I've grown it all my life.

01:08:52.421 --> 01:08:56.466
Jimi is a teacher and a fountain.
And a bomb shelter.

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:59.571
You want to see photos of
the pony I care for? - Of course.

01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:02.408
Where? Oh.

01:10:04.493 --> 01:10:08.122
Why did you take your phone out?
- The photos are here.

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:16.964
Oh. - That's Svante.
I train jumping with him.

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:23.762
He's a Connemara. He's really sweet
and loves jumping.

01:10:24.847 --> 01:10:28.475
This is Ivanhoe.
He's my friend Saara's pony.

01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:41.780
This is me jumping with Svante.

01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:48.412
Wow. Nice.

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:54.084

I think it's time for us to go.

01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:23.947
What? Already?
- Yeah.

01:11:29.161 --> 01:11:32.915
You want to come watch me
compete? It's next Saturday.

01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:41.965
Of course. I'll definitely come
if I can make it.

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:45.969
Where is it?

01:11:53.185 --> 01:11:54.937
Come put your coat on.

01:11:57.397 --> 01:11:59.066
Okay.

01:12:11.036 --> 01:12:13.455
I've seen you with Olkkonen.

01:12:15.958 --> 01:12:17.960
I knew you were coming.

01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:20.963
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:23.215
Does Olkkonen have a big one?
- What?

01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:25.843
You can tell him
there's not a chance.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:30.097
Even if he's jack T. Chance. Tell
him that if your mind is blind, -

01:12:30.264 --> 01:12:33.016
you won't recognize
what you're looking for.

01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:36.687
All right. Bye, Ilmari.
- Bye bye.

01:12:42.651 --> 01:12:46.321
Oh. I have something.

01:12:48.657 --> 01:12:51.451
Oh. Thank you.

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.037
Bye.
- BYE bye, Varpu.

01:12:56.915 --> 01:12:58.750
BYE bye!

01:13:04.506 --> 01:13:08.218
Dad's also coming
to the competition.

01:13:08.677 --> 01:13:12.681
You invited him?
- Yeah. What's the problem?

01:13:12.931 --> 01:13:15.267
Ilmari is cool.

01:13:15.517 --> 01:13:19.187
Oh, honey, Ilmari won't come
to the competition.

01:13:20.606 --> 01:13:22.441
What do you mean he won't come?

01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:28.113
He's never left this city.
And, like...

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.199
And maybe it's better that way.
- What do you mean?

01:13:31.325 --> 01:13:35.329
How can you say that?
- I can because I know him.

01:13:35.495 --> 01:13:37.247
What do you mean you know him?

01:13:37.414 --> 01:13:40.417
You talked to him for, like,
one second.

01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:44.755
The rest of the time
you were like this. - Right.

01:13:46.006 --> 01:13:51.720
I took a quick loan
so that you could meet your dad.

01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:57.100
And I managed to ruin everything
because I'm a shitty person.

01:13:57.309 --> 01:14:01.438
I didn't say that. - I try so hard
all the time. I do my best.

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:08.153
I have this much energy, and
the little I have I spend on...

01:14:11.156 --> 01:14:13.617
I'm so lonely.

01:14:14.618 --> 01:14:18.246
I feel like I'm suffocating.
- Seriously, I'm not interested.

01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:22.834
How come you've become so cold?

01:14:24.795 --> 01:14:26.838
Varpu. Varpu.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.426
Varpu.

01:14:48.777 --> 01:14:51.446
I'm bummed that I can't
come see you compete.

01:14:51.822 --> 01:14:55.659
I have to accept all the work
they throw my way. - It's okay.

01:14:57.577 --> 01:15:01.164
All right. Good luck.

01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:06.128
Have fun.
- Okay.

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:09.047
I'll come to the next one.

01:16:02.851 --> 01:16:06.646
Hello? Who is it?
<i>- What?</i>

01:16:07.105 --> 01:16:11.610
Who is it?
<i>- Varpu? Yoo-hoo?</i>

01:16:42.891 --> 01:16:44.601
Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:46.061 --> 01:16:50.690
You came.
- Of course.

01:16:54.236 --> 01:16:58.448
How did you get here?
- By car.

01:17:00.534 --> 01:17:02.202
Okay.

01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:09.543
I have a gift for you.

01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:15.257
Or what do you call it. A doodle.

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:20.846
Did you make this?
- Yeah.

01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:25.517
I tried to remember what that pony
you care for looks like...

01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:30.689
Was his name Svante?
- Yeah. This is awesome.

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:33.900
Thanks a lot.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:17:38.989 --> 01:17:40.782
You have a Mercedes?

01:17:40.949 --> 01:17:45.036
I wouldn't drive you around in some
piece of junk. - That's a cool car.

01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:48.123
Is it yours?
- No, it's a friend's.

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:04.431
Sorry.

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:19.070
Eyes on the road.

01:18:28.205 --> 01:18:31.124
I think it's nice
that we look so much alike.

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:36.296
Do we?
- Oh yes. We look so much alike.

01:18:37.088 --> 01:18:39.090
Like two peas in a pod.

01:18:57.192 --> 01:18:59.903
I have to get Svante ready.
Gotta run!

01:19:05.617 --> 01:19:08.828
First I'll groom and braid
Svante, -

01:19:08.995 --> 01:19:13.041
and then I'll warm up for thirty
minutes at the outdoor arena.

01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:16.962
The competition is in the indoor
arena, and there are bleachers.

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:23.009
One, two, three, four, five, -

01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:32.060
six, seven, eight... Twenty.

01:19:33.979 --> 01:19:36.982
Twenty meters.
I'll do this with six strides.

01:19:37.148 --> 01:19:39.985
You can't smoke in here, right?
- What do you mean?

01:19:40.277 --> 01:19:42.195
Look.

01:19:44.114 --> 01:19:45.740
Oh.

01:19:46.825 --> 01:19:48.451
Wait.

01:19:53.748 --> 01:19:55.834
What's he doing?

01:19:57.002 --> 01:20:02.549
You can't smoke in here.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:20:03.008 --> 01:20:05.885
Come here a second.

01:20:06.052 --> 01:20:09.014
A hug. Hi.

01:20:09.222 --> 01:20:10.807
I give you thumbs up.
- Okay.

01:20:10.932 --> 01:20:12.559
Okay then.

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:20.734
Can you hold Imppu for a moment
while I tighten the girth?

01:20:27.449 --> 01:20:31.411
Okay.
Let's show them, all right?

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:36.833
Be a good boy
and jump all of them, okay?

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:40.128
I know you will.
You're so good at it.

01:20:41.755 --> 01:20:43.548
I'm a little nervous.

01:20:45.216 --> 01:20:47.344
Don't you get nervous.

01:20:48.178 --> 01:20:53.058
Ponies have nothing to be nervous
about. They don't get nervous.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.562
Ivanhoe was cranky yesterday.
We'll see how it goes today.

01:20:57.812 --> 01:21:00.732
I told Saara to take it easy,
and it'll go well.

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:04.903
There are quite a lot of people
here. - Yeah, it's nice.

01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:08.948
<i>The result for</i>

All right. Here we go.

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:32.555
What are you doing with it?
- I'll shoot Saara's performance.

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:34.724
Why? Look.

01:23:06.191 --> 01:23:08.985
You can't smoke here.
- What?

01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:11.571
Isn't this the smoking area?

01:23:12.113 --> 01:23:16.117
Where the hell can I smoke then?
- Go outside. - What?

01:23:16.868 --> 01:23:19.412
What's the matter here?
What's going on?

01:23:19.579 --> 01:23:22.957
What are you filming?
- Excuse me, the competition is on.

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:27.712
You have to be quiet.
- You stay out of it.

01:23:28.213 --> 01:23:29.881
I have nothing on me.

01:23:31.049 --> 01:23:32.884
What the fuck?

01:23:42.727 --> 01:23:44.979
You can't go there!

01:23:45.772 --> 01:23:49.192
<i>Varpu! Hey, Varpu. - We
apologize for the interruption...</i>

01:23:49.359 --> 01:23:51.611
Let's go home.
This is not a good place.

01:23:52.403 --> 01:23:54.656
Dad, what's wrong with you?
Calm down.

01:23:54.822 --> 01:23:58.826
You're not supposed to be here.
- These people are filming us.

01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:01.371
They're filming us now.

01:24:01.538 --> 01:24:04.999
You have to leave immediately.
- I'm not afraid of you.

01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:07.001
We'll escort him out.
- Thanks.

01:24:07.168 --> 01:24:09.754
It's cool. It's cool.

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:21.391
Is that your dad?
- Yeah.

01:24:22.141 --> 01:24:26.187
Okay. Is he drunk?
- I don't know.

01:24:26.646 --> 01:24:31.651
I see. Should I call your mom?
- Don't call her.

01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:38.950
Well, Benkku and Jari will look
after him. Everything will be fine.

01:24:39.993 --> 01:24:42.954
You can finish this round
if you want, -

01:24:43.204 --> 01:24:46.541
since the interruption wasn't
your fault. Do you want to?

01:24:49.627 --> 01:24:53.881
No. - You sure?
We've practiced the whole fall.

01:24:55.842 --> 01:24:57.927
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:25:23.286 --> 01:25:27.624
You sure you can drive?
- Yes. I feel a lot better.

01:25:27.832 --> 01:25:29.584
You sure?
- Oh yes.

01:25:33.296 --> 01:25:34.964
Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.176
Is everything all right?
- Yes.

01:25:39.093 --> 01:25:44.557
Take it easy, will you? Bye.
- Thanks.

01:25:51.981 --> 01:25:53.733
Can you open the door?

01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:02.408
What was that?
You ruined my competition.

01:26:05.161 --> 01:26:07.622
You have your cellphone nearby?
- Yeah.

01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:10.458
Can you turn it off and
take the battery out?

01:26:10.708 --> 01:26:12.669
Why?
-just do it.

01:26:20.718 --> 01:26:25.473
I don't know how to talk to a child
about something like this.

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:28.476
But I think you should know.

01:26:28.726 --> 01:26:32.313
I'm a so-called persona non grata
in this country.

01:26:33.398 --> 01:26:37.485
It means
I'm an unwanted person.

01:26:38.569 --> 01:26:45.034
It's because people don't dig
that I have strong opinions -

01:26:45.368 --> 01:26:49.664
and I'm not afraid to express them.
It makes people anxious.

01:26:49.914 --> 01:26:51.958
I think it's really absurd -

01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:58.464
because I've always been
a supporter of peace and equality -

01:26:58.673 --> 01:27:01.426
and have always been
opposed to violence.

01:27:01.634 --> 01:27:06.180
I'm on the black list of the Finnish
Security Intelligence Service.

01:27:07.557 --> 01:27:12.603
And of the American NSA and
the British GCHQ. - Can we go?

01:27:15.314 --> 01:27:17.483
Yeah, we can.

01:27:29.078 --> 01:27:32.832
The car's been sabotaged.
- What?

01:27:38.546 --> 01:27:40.506
How about I drive?

01:27:43.468 --> 01:27:45.136
Yeah. Good.

01:28:25.635 --> 01:28:27.720
Does this have winter tires?

01:28:29.514 --> 01:28:32.391
I suddenly feel my head is empty.

01:28:37.104 --> 01:28:39.106
Why did you help them?

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:42.735
Are you really my child?

01:28:46.447 --> 01:28:49.242
Damn, I can't take this anymore.

01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:54.038
What?

01:28:55.873 --> 01:28:58.042
Not true.

01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:01.921
I have a right
to see my own daughter.

01:29:02.839 --> 01:29:04.799
Fuck you.

01:29:05.007 --> 01:29:08.052
I won't listen to you.
You're just feeding me things.

01:29:12.306 --> 01:29:15.184
What? I don't want to.

01:29:16.394 --> 01:29:19.939
I don't want to.
There's got to be another way.

01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:22.400
Seriously, there's got to be.

01:29:22.567 --> 01:29:25.152
Fuck, she's just a child.

01:29:28.322 --> 01:29:30.908
I don't like the way you talk.

01:29:33.244 --> 01:29:35.496
You can't do that.

01:29:37.164 --> 01:29:39.625
That's horrible. Stop, goddammit.

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.421
Fucking shut up!

01:29:43.671 --> 01:29:47.884
Kill yourself!
Kill yourself, whore!

01:29:48.009 --> 01:29:49.635
You whore!

01:31:57.596 --> 01:32:00.558
Mom. Mom.

01:32:02.977 --> 01:32:05.229
I had a car accident.

01:32:07.773 --> 01:32:09.567
I had a car accident.

01:32:39.889 --> 01:32:41.891
My little girl.

01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:47.396
Everything's all right.

01:33:28.687 --> 01:33:30.356
Hi.
- Hi.

01:33:32.775 --> 01:33:37.530
Hey, boy.
You want to go jump?

01:33:45.913 --> 01:33:48.791
Varpu, can I ask you something?
- What is it?

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:55.005
Was your dad high
at the competition? - No.

01:33:59.135 --> 01:34:00.970
Was he drunk?

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:04.431
Okay.

01:34:07.893 --> 01:34:10.187
He has schizophrenia.

01:34:10.688 --> 01:34:14.775
He heard voices that weren't real.

01:34:15.151 --> 01:34:18.821
He meant no harm.

01:34:19.405 --> 01:34:21.615
Does he hear voices all the time?

01:34:21.824 --> 01:34:26.912
Now he takes medication, -

01:34:27.204 --> 01:34:31.375
so he doesn't hear them that much.

01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:40.593
But he said he sometimes
still hears someone singing.

01:34:42.803 --> 01:34:46.974
He said it sounds like windows
singing really quietly.

01:34:49.185 --> 01:34:52.354
That's pretty crazy.
- Yeah.

01:34:53.814 --> 01:35:00.779
Yep. I need to groom Ivanhoe.
Wanna come with me? - Okay.

01:35:12.917 --> 01:35:14.752
What car is that?

01:35:20.216 --> 01:35:23.802
That's my mom.
- Your mom?

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.598
Did she come pick you up?
- I guess so.

01:35:29.975 --> 01:35:31.810
Bye.
- Bye.

01:35:36.190 --> 01:35:39.777
Mom, you're driving a car.
- I got it. I got it!

01:35:39.944 --> 01:35:42.821
What? When?
- Yesterday.

01:35:43.572 --> 01:35:46.408
Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to surprise you.

01:35:46.575 --> 01:35:49.578
How many tests did you
have to take? - Five.

01:35:49.954 --> 01:35:51.830
Five!

01:36:01.548 --> 01:36:03.342
Can you open this?

01:36:04.218 --> 01:36:08.514
Bo made it for me.
- Bo, Bo, Bo and Bo.

01:36:14.687 --> 01:36:19.775
<i>When a new human is born</i>

01:36:24.571 --> 01:36:28.701
<i>She is free</i>

01:36:29.994 --> 01:36:35.791
<i>She cries, laughs and dances</i>

01:36:43.465 --> 01:36:48.012
<i>She becomes inspired</i>

01:37:00.941 --> 01:37:05.779
<i>With loving hands</i>

01:37:09.325 --> 01:37:14.413
<i>She grabs the sun</i>

01:37:15.581 --> 01:37:20.002
<i>And flies</i>

01:37:22.087 --> 01:37:32.723
<i>Far away</i>

01:37:39.313 --> 01:37:44.234
<i>Mom and Dad, so small</i>

01:37:47.613 --> 01:37:53.911
