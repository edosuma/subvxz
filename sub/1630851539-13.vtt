WEBVTT

00:03.404 --> 00:06.207
I can't believe
someone took Max.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.575
You guys should be
looking for her.
We need some help.

00:07.708 --> 00:08.942
You kidnapped
T-Lock's girlfriend and her kid.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.778
Where are they?
Beats me.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.613
Please, please,
let us go.
If your boyfriend shows up

00:12.746 --> 00:14.615
with what he's supposed to,
then we can talk.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.783
Drop the money
and walk.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.552
Aah!

00:26.560 --> 00:27.661
Ren: Are we really
pulling out of Canada?

00:27.795 --> 00:29.763
Things change.
That's what life is.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.432
Of course, but why?

00:31.565 --> 00:33.601
Something Dad's
not telling us?
Alicia knows.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.069
What do you know
about her?

00:35.203 --> 00:36.770
I'll do some digging. Yep.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.572
Cassie: How did you get Ronald
in the first place?

00:38.706 --> 00:39.940
Made a deal
with the syndicate.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.777
I am going
to put him down.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.282
Ronald: Look what
you made me do.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.950
You couldn't
leave me alone.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.673
Hey.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.308
Hey.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.679
It's over.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.317
Lindor?

01:23.451 --> 01:26.620
He's gonna be fine.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.956
What about Phoebe
and Scarlet?

01:29.089 --> 01:32.360
Uh, they're gone.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.861
That's impossible.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.029
We'll find them,
and as soon as we question Wolf,

01:36.164 --> 01:41.101
we'll get more information,
but for you, it's over.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.939
Hey.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.444
You got him.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.681
I'm tired.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.585
Let's get you home.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.399
Just relax, sir.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.700
Y-You're gonna be okay.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.067
Where's Wolf Legarski?

02:14.202 --> 02:16.404
He's on his way
to the hospital, okay?

02:20.674 --> 02:22.576
Can you hear me?

02:26.647 --> 02:29.383
Scarlet and the girl.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.719
Where are they?

02:31.852 --> 02:33.521
What?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.668
What is this?

02:49.237 --> 02:50.804
We need to tidy
your mess.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.139
My mess...

02:52.273 --> 02:54.942
Do you remember the deal
you struck?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.078
Yeah.

02:58.212 --> 03:01.048
Mistakes were made.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.118
Most of us were not on board
for your little experiment.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.655
I didn't fail.
I didn't fail.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.257
I t-- I tried.
I really tried.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.459
Scarlet.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.727
Where is she?

03:14.595 --> 03:16.797
Huh?

03:16.930 --> 03:19.267
I don't know.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.940
You're lucky.

03:27.074 --> 03:31.144
The bullet missed
all your vital organs.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.316
You would have survived.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.919
What now?

03:41.221 --> 03:45.092
John Milton
sends his regards.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.961
No! No, no!

03:48.095 --> 03:49.630
No! No!

04:34.542 --> 04:35.809
Go on.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.144
I'll wait for you.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.223
Max, I am so sorry about
everything that happened.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.092
Bridger: Yeah.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.827
Being kidnapped isn't nearly
as fun as everyone says.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.162
Bridger.
Not the time.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.730
Copy.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.499
You know, I keep thinking,
if I hadn't wished

04:58.632 --> 05:00.033
for something to happen
in this town

05:00.167 --> 05:01.769
when I threw that stone
off the ridge...

05:01.902 --> 05:03.604
And I gave you
the stone.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.773
And I took the bags.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.274
I basically did
nothing wrong.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.409
Except drive
the getaway car?

05:08.542 --> 05:09.943
Yeah, that.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.884
It's never gonna be the same,
is it?

05:19.219 --> 05:21.088
Well, maybe we'll see you guys
this summer.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.357
We're being sent away
to boarding school.

05:23.491 --> 05:26.527
Oh.
Who knows?
Maybe I'll meet some girls.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.096
Not that you guys
aren't girls.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.398
You're, like, full-on girls.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.065
Like, women, for sure.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.434
But -- maybe the hottest
I've ever seen, right?

05:33.567 --> 05:36.269
Bridger!
You are such an incel.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.205
You're gonna, like,
end up living in my basement,

05:38.338 --> 05:41.274
eating Spam and, like,
owning people on your podcast.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.043
That's great. Wow.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.078
Thank you for the faith.
Love you too, sis.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.781
Um...

05:47.915 --> 05:49.917
I guess
we'll see you guys around.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.925
Bridger, come on. Okay.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.168
See you guys.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.173
So...

06:13.306 --> 06:16.977
So...
I should get going.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.011
My mom's waiting.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.480
Yeah.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.281
Hey,
don't be a stranger.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.951
You know, I'm always here
if you need me.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.130
I know you are.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.936
I could come with you.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.906
I mean,
if your mom doesn't mind.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.443
Okay.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.653
Tonya:
Based on the test run,

06:59.787 --> 07:01.789
we should be able to produce
about 4,000 pills an hour.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.356
Not too shabby.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.325
I got this operation
on lock.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.561
Yeah, it's great
watching Tonya do all the work.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.196
Ha. Funny.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.864
What's the ETA
on the first shipment?

07:10.998 --> 07:12.399
Should be ready
by tomorrow morning.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.834
Boom.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.435
You are doing
such a good job.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.575
Dad's gonna want
one of us to oversee, so...

07:21.709 --> 07:23.477
Yeah, that's gonna
have to be you.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.146
Really? We might want to
talk to Dad about that.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.548
You can,
but he's got me setting up

07:27.681 --> 07:29.016
a sit-down with Dietrich, so...

07:30.117 --> 07:31.318
That's news to me.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.253
Well, I'm just doing
what I'm told.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.256
Uh, you find anything
on Alicia?

07:36.389 --> 07:37.558
Not yet, but I will.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.860
We're having lunch.
How about you?

07:39.993 --> 07:42.429
I got my girl Priti
building a file on her.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.031
Great.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.432
Look at us.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.902
We're like Kyle Lowry
and Kawhi Leonard.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.504
Is that
a sports boy thing?

07:50.638 --> 07:52.773
It's the only NBA championship
in Canadian history.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.407
What kind of Canadian
are you?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.209
I'm not just Canadian, I'm Desi.
I'm part of the Diaspora.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.045
Okay, whatever.
Just pass me the ball.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.412
More sports.
I really don't care.
Just pass, I'll catch it...

07:59.547 --> 08:00.548
...shoot, make it, and boom.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.415
I don't care at all.
What?

08:02.550 --> 08:03.751
I hate everything
that you're saying.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.252
Found this one
lurking outside.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.386
What do you mean
"lurking"?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.221
How else would you
describe it?

08:08.355 --> 08:09.723
Loitering, maybe.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.258
Okay, Ren, can I talk to you
in private, please?

08:11.391 --> 08:12.893
Sure.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.597
That's my cowboy.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.899
Gross.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.110
Oh.
Win-win.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.245
How did you get this?
Don't worry.
I got my ways.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.082
Well, that sounds
kind of sexy.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.817
So what now?

08:36.950 --> 08:40.754
Well, you get a gold star
and a smiley face.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.291
Okay.
And in the, uh...

08:44.424 --> 08:45.458
In the meanwhile?

08:45.593 --> 08:47.127
Um, oh.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.762
Our first shipment's
almost done.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.398
You can help Donno and Tonya
make sure it goes smoothly.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.768
Yeah?

09:01.108 --> 09:03.310
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm glad Cassie's okay.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.846
Cassie's far from okay.
And I get it.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.748
And Ronald Pergman is dead,
and that's a good thing.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.449
But you can't just up and leave
like you did.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.684
This Bob is still
on the loose.

09:10.818 --> 09:11.952
He's a kidnapper
and a murderer.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.587
Cassie's my friend,

09:13.721 --> 09:15.188
and there was nothing else
for me to do at the crime scene.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.591
But she is not your partner
anymore, Jenny.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.326
Poppernak is.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.496
I know.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.965
Good.
Don't forget it again,

09:25.098 --> 09:26.834
'cause right now
the Bhullars are the focus.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.269
We don't get control of things,
it reflects very badly on me.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.771
And me.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.443
This is Tubb.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.148
Okay, text her the address.
She's on her way.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.515
That was your partner.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.017
He's got a location
on your kidnapper.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.786
Call you later.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.223
How we looking, boys?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.826
<i>Nix, Harris,
do you read?</i>

09:54.762 --> 09:56.163
Deputy Nix:
<i>First floor is clear.</i>

09:56.296 --> 09:58.031
Looks like
we got a basement.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.066
Heading down.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.014
Hey.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.883
Heard Cassie got Pergman.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.751
I'll fill you in later.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.787
Got some of our people
inside?

10:20.854 --> 10:22.656
Two.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.024
Deputy Nix: <i>Oh, man.</i>

10:24.157 --> 10:26.526
This is Hoyt. What is it?
Are we clear?

10:26.660 --> 10:28.862
<i>Yeah, but there's something
you guys need to see.</i>

10:36.003 --> 10:37.404
What's going on?

10:37.537 --> 10:39.106
Did you guys
find something?

10:39.239 --> 10:41.074
Uh, you could say that.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.576
You know how you've, uh, been
looking for that special friend

10:43.711 --> 10:45.512
who will never get sick
of all your stories?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.515
Guys.
Here he is.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.885
Ha, ha. Ha.
Yeah, very funny.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.189
Deputy Nix: Bring him
to poker night, yeah?

10:56.323 --> 10:59.793
Guys, alright,
let's wrap it up and head back.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.194
Something's not right.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.764
What's up?
What's the matter?

11:03.897 --> 11:05.899
Come on.
We should go.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.735
Don't touch anything.
Let's go.
You heard her, fellas. Let's go.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.903
Come on.
What about your new buddy, huh?

11:10.037 --> 11:11.071
Bye, Pop.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.773
I said don't --

11:12.906 --> 11:14.374
Bomb!

11:29.356 --> 11:30.690
Hoyt.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.895
It's okay.
Don't move.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.430
The others --

12:02.589 --> 12:04.291
Stone!

12:06.426 --> 12:08.328
Yeah?

12:09.596 --> 12:11.965
You don't write,
you don't call...

12:12.099 --> 12:13.767
I've been busy.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.836
With the Bhullars, or, uh,
bedtime stories with Blondie?

12:15.969 --> 12:20.273
Yeah, that and
trying to find your friend Bob.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.109
He's really
messed things up, D.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.277
I've got bigger problems
than Bob.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.013
Veer Bhullar reached out.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.447
He wants to talk.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.116
What about?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.318
Mm, I came here
to ask <i>you</i> that.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.121
I got nothing for you, man.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.028
Well, maybe he wants
to make things right.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.462
D, I got, uh...

12:42.595 --> 12:44.464
I got some advice
for you.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.869
Okay, the Bhullars,
they don't need you anymore.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.971
You're of no value to them,

12:51.104 --> 12:53.373
and I think you're walking into
a trap right now.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.743
Maybe.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.546
But I'm as good as dead
if I don't go.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.482
Feeling optimistic.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.385
Like I said,
me and the old man,

13:05.518 --> 13:07.554
we've gotten along
for a long time.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.764
No. I do not need this
in my life.

13:17.898 --> 13:18.899
I told you.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.834
And I hate you.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.605
You know, your father thinks
you've gone native.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.174
I don't know about that.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.277
Well, you do have a real handle
on the local culture.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.912
I don't know if you can call
huckleberry pie "culture,"

13:32.045 --> 13:34.614
but I will take
the compliment.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.050
I mean, Montana.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.220
I am surprised
my dad likes it.

13:40.353 --> 13:43.690
Mm, well, "like" is not
how I would describe it.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.426
Well,
how would <i>he</i> describe it?

13:47.427 --> 13:49.930
Your father is not one
for sentiment.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.565
I know that.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.267
Especially after Mom...

13:54.401 --> 13:57.104
Okay, here we go.

13:57.237 --> 14:00.073
Did you think
I wasn't gonna ask?

14:00.207 --> 14:02.742
I would have been disappointed
if you hadn't.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.779
What would you like
to know?

14:06.914 --> 14:07.948
Everything.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.917
It doesn't work that way, honey.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.784
You gotta ask.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.622
Accountant.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.593
I was doing some work
with your father

14:20.727 --> 14:23.463
and sparks flew.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.765
It's really
that simple.

14:25.899 --> 14:29.302
And now you're just both here,
and you're gonna stay?

14:29.436 --> 14:31.104
Simple?

14:31.238 --> 14:33.406
More like weird.
Not like my dad.

14:34.407 --> 14:37.777
You know, I'm surprised
you're not more happy about it.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.980
Wasn't Montana
your idea?

14:43.216 --> 14:45.118
Do we have trouble
in Canada?

14:45.252 --> 14:48.321
I think those are questions
that you need to ask him.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.457
You don't know my dad.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.425
I kinda do.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.968
You do know that
we don't have to do this, right?

15:01.101 --> 15:05.272
I like to think us girls
could find a better way.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.441
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.144
Of course you do.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.949
It has been so great
to get to know each other.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.527
Hey, Jenny, Jenny.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.629
Hell. You okay?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.798
I'm fine.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.700
What the hell happened?

15:34.667 --> 15:37.137
Bob rigged the place.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.373
Killed two deputies,
and Poppernak's in the hospital.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.375
Jesus.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.084
Robert MacIntyre.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.419
Well, at least we know
who he is,

15:52.552 --> 15:54.854
so it's not gonna be
so hard to find him now.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.425
Bob's probably
already gone.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.828
Hey, hey.
You don't know that, okay?

16:01.961 --> 16:06.066
All I know is I got two deputies
that are dead,

16:06.199 --> 16:07.734
and I got to do
something about it.

16:14.407 --> 16:18.545
Dietrich:
I'm happy you're here, Veer.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.414
Hap-- Happy?
H-How so?

16:21.548 --> 16:24.217
Well, things have been
complicated for a bit.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.252
I'm aware.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.886
They weren't complicated.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.555
One of your men
stole from us.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.259
He was acting on his own,

16:32.392 --> 16:34.094
and, uh,
not getting my money back,

16:34.227 --> 16:35.562
I think,
was a fair price to pay.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.597
It's not your money.
You keep forgetting that.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.032
It's <i>our</i> money.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.369
Everything that you have
is because of us.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.937
You bet. Sure.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.576
So what now?

16:51.744 --> 16:55.848
You and I, we've always had
a good relationship.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.752
I'm hoping that
there's a road back to normal.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.756
You've been useful to us
in the past,

17:03.890 --> 17:05.092
and, you know, maybe
you'll come up with a way

17:05.225 --> 17:06.826
of being useful to us
in the future,

17:06.959 --> 17:11.098
but first, I need to make
something very clear.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.266
Go on.
I'm listening.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.603
We are not equals.

17:18.105 --> 17:22.542
I'm gonna give you
one last chance to grasp this.

17:25.745 --> 17:26.946
What the hell is this?

17:27.080 --> 17:28.981
Son?

17:29.116 --> 17:31.118
With pleasure.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.785
No.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.787
No, you, <i>beta.</i>

17:34.921 --> 17:36.123
Not Dhruv.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.957
What?

17:38.091 --> 17:39.126
You. I want you
to take care of this.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.661
I want you
to get your hands dirty.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.603
This is a test.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.641
For both of you.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.827
Go on.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.975
Is that all you got?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.546
That's enough.

18:33.680 --> 18:38.050
I will tell you
when it's enough!

18:38.185 --> 18:40.753
This man threatened
your sister, your blood.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.855
If you do not put him
on the ground,

18:42.989 --> 18:46.326
I will have Dhruv
do the same to you.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.089
I believe
this belongs to you.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.425
Consider it severance

19:18.558 --> 19:21.060
until you can prove yourself
useful again.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.407
Hey, you shaved.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.575
Looks good,
more professional.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.278
Yeah.
How's all this gonna work?

19:38.411 --> 19:39.579
Simple.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.314
Donno's gonna give you
one parcel each.

19:41.448 --> 19:42.915
You hide it
with your legitimate cargo,

19:43.049 --> 19:44.317
and then you each
make a side trip

19:44.451 --> 19:47.354
to a destination
indicated in these envelopes.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.091
What if we're searched?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.794
You won't be, because you're not
gonna give the cops a reason

19:54.927 --> 19:56.596
to pull you over
in the first place.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.231
Once you deliver
the parcel,

19:58.365 --> 19:59.966
we'll be notified
by the receiver.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.101
Don't look like much.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.436
Why'd you need
two of us?

20:03.570 --> 20:05.772
Split the risk.
Okay?

20:05.905 --> 20:08.140
Let's go.
Clock's ticking.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.111
Is there a problem?

20:12.245 --> 20:14.614
You make it all sound
so easy.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.115
What's the catch?

20:16.249 --> 20:18.618
There is none,
if you follow the instructions.

20:18.751 --> 20:19.952
And if you don't want
the gig,

20:20.086 --> 20:21.488
there's always another guy
in line.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.922
Is that so?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.257
Just listen to her,
okay?

20:24.391 --> 20:27.126
Leave it, J...

20:27.260 --> 20:28.361
You want to tread
on me?

20:28.495 --> 20:29.796
W-W-What are you gonna do?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.698
I'll tread right back, friend.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.100
Alright, enough
of the cowboy crap, Jamison.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.370
Let's go.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.638
Pack it up.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.147
You trust them?

20:48.281 --> 20:49.649
I do.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.385
He's just got to let everybody
know he's a tough guy.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.721
Yeah? Well,
tough guys get killed.

20:54.854 --> 20:55.955
Tough guys
get <i>us</i> killed.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.624
We paid him to drive,
not to talk.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.726
You need to tell him
to do just that.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.794
I hear you.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.230
You got a backup plan?

21:04.364 --> 21:07.199
No,
but just to be safe,

21:07.334 --> 21:09.902
I'll follow Jamison
till he makes the drop-off.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.339
That's a good idea.
I'll do the same.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.140
Donno:
That wasn't part of the plan.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.976
You need me to ride shotgun
with you?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.546
No, thanks.
I got this.

21:22.349 --> 21:25.217
Look what we have here.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.106
Hey, Hoyt.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.841
How you doing?

21:48.975 --> 21:51.077
Think <i>I</i> should be
the one asking <i>you</i> that.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.881
How you feeling?

21:55.014 --> 21:58.084
You know, cracked ribs,
maybe a concussion.

21:58.217 --> 22:00.620
I'll be out of here
as soon as they tell
me my head is right.

22:00.753 --> 22:03.255
That could take a while.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.095
Ah, funny.

22:13.533 --> 22:14.567
Yeah.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.703
We got lucky.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.939
Nix and Harris...

22:21.073 --> 22:23.209
I know.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.949
ATF is taking over the case,
but I'm gonna get this guy.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.618
I promise you that.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.559
What?

22:39.692 --> 22:41.861
You got no one to watch
your back while I'm in here.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.331
Oh, I got Travis.

22:45.465 --> 22:46.833
Yeah, Mr. Undercover.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.735
It's...

22:48.868 --> 22:51.103
It's not much better,
in my opinion.

22:51.237 --> 22:54.106
Not that you asked,

22:54.240 --> 22:58.778
but promise you'll watch
your back with him, too.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.413
Noted.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.118
Rest up. Yeah.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.955
"A World Without Email."

23:09.088 --> 23:11.090
Yeah.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.661
Jenny?

23:18.130 --> 23:19.899
Thank you.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.570
Yeah.

23:30.276 --> 23:31.811
Hey.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.847
Did your girl Priti
find anything out about Alicia?

23:34.981 --> 23:36.282
I don't trust her.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.618
She's not like
Dad's other girlfriends.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.353
I mean, she told me
if I wanted to know something,

23:41.488 --> 23:42.822
I should just ask Dad myself.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.157
Like that's
ever worked.

23:45.291 --> 23:48.027
We got to figure out
why he just suddenly
wants to leave Canada.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.696
Ren,
just leave it alone.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.197
No, we need to know
everything, Jag.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.365
No, <i>we</i> don't need
to know everything.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.801
<i>You</i> need to know everything,

23:54.934 --> 23:56.335
because you've got to be
in control all the time,

23:56.469 --> 23:59.171
but I'm begging you,
leave it alone!

24:02.441 --> 24:03.676
What happened?

24:05.645 --> 24:07.880
I don't want to
talk about it.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.516
What did you do?

24:09.649 --> 24:11.584
What do you think?

24:11.718 --> 24:14.854
I did what Dad
told me to do.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.190
Are you okay?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.698
Just be grateful
you weren't there.

24:52.559 --> 24:53.926
I don't know.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.095
There's some horse on fire
in the middle of the road.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.263

Good answer.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.037
Means you get to live.

26:32.825 --> 26:35.161
So who is he?
Cal Jamison.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.363
Works for
a local trucking company.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.567
Well, then,
where's his truck?

26:41.701 --> 26:44.070
Good question.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.538
You thinking
this is cartel-related?

26:46.673 --> 26:47.940
Can't say
I'd be shocked.

26:53.045 --> 26:56.883
I'm gonna run this for prints,
see if we get lucky.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.985
Okay.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.063
Any advice?

27:11.197 --> 27:12.899
On what?

27:13.032 --> 27:15.234
How to tell Ren
we lost a shipment?

27:16.568 --> 27:18.104
"We" didn't lose anything.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.872
Donno.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.108
You need to take responsibility
for your actions.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.076
There was nothing
I could do.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.412
You could have killed
the hijacker.

27:26.545 --> 27:28.414
That's what <i>I</i>
would have done.

27:28.547 --> 27:30.182
I would have.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.751
Fine,
next time I'll do that.

27:31.884 --> 27:32.852
Good.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.054
Learn from your mistakes.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.691
If there is a next time
for you.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.727
What?

27:40.860 --> 27:44.596
Ren doesn't really do well
with news like this.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.099
Well, that's why
I'm asking you for advice.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.901
Mm.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.236
Good point.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.940
Thank you.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.909
How'd it go?

28:00.079 --> 28:02.214
We...

28:06.552 --> 28:07.820
I lost a shipment.

28:07.954 --> 28:09.789
The truck was hijacked.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.591
Where was Stone?

28:12.725 --> 28:15.161
Following the other truck.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.603
We're gonna fix it.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.105
We'll get
the shipment back.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.307
You better.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.710
This is not the kind of thing
that my father will tolerate.

28:34.613 --> 28:37.116
Neither will I.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.095
Hey.
What's going on?

28:49.228 --> 28:50.997
Bob hijacked a truck.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.999
What?
Yeah.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.934
And killed the driver.
Wait a minute.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.103
How you know that?
You got witnesses?

28:57.236 --> 28:59.471
No, but his prints
were on a shell casing
at the crime scene.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.608
What is this guy doing,
Travis?

29:02.741 --> 29:05.011
He has to hijack a truck
just to get out of town?

29:05.144 --> 29:07.646
H-He's got a big bag of money.
It just doesn't add up.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.782
Ren just called.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.984
They had
a shipment hijacked.

29:14.821 --> 29:16.688
It must have been
the truck.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.193
Is Dietrich involved
in this?

29:21.327 --> 29:23.062
I don't know.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.430
Maybe.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.833
Let's go ask him.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.535
Okay.

29:37.676 --> 29:40.646
I already told you,
I've got nothing to do with Bob.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.014
Travis: Yeah,
but it doesn't mean

29:42.148 --> 29:43.549
he's not gonna reach out
with an offer, D.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.151
Jenny: Or that you won't
take him up on it.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.318
And why would I
do that?

29:46.452 --> 29:49.055
I don't know.
'Cause you like money.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.391
I'm pretty sure
I'm not the only one.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.827
Helping Bob unload
a stolen shipment

29:54.961 --> 29:56.896
would be
a pretty sweet revenge.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.066
Yeah, you know,
you're right.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.068
Now I'm <i>hoping</i>
he reaches out.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.203
Yeah, well, that'd be
a death sentence for you, D,

30:04.336 --> 30:06.072
'cause the Bhullars
will find out.

30:06.205 --> 30:09.575
And guess what?
If they don't, I'mma tell them.

30:09.708 --> 30:10.877
Oh, yeah.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.212
I imagine a rat like you
would do that.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.114
♪ Hit all the joints around

30:15.247 --> 30:16.849
You know,
I'm hoping for one of you

30:16.983 --> 30:19.418
to start acting
like a cop.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.021
If it was up to me,
you'd be behind bars.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.757
Mm-hmm. But I'm not,
and neither are the Bhullars.

30:25.892 --> 30:28.194
Hey, hey, hey, those options
you were talking about,

30:28.327 --> 30:30.762
you don't have any, D,
except with me.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.398
Okay?
So just remember that.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.034

30:35.167 --> 30:36.302
that gets you
all hot and bothered?

30:36.435 --> 30:38.070
You have no idea.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.072

31:02.028 --> 31:04.296
We friends again?

31:04.430 --> 31:06.798
No.

31:06.933 --> 31:09.401
But I am sick of people
telling me what to do.

31:11.403 --> 31:14.907
Let's sell some drugs.

31:22.148 --> 31:26.252
Mm. Fascinating.
Has a surprising sweet flavor.

31:26.385 --> 31:32.258
Mm-hmm. Plus, bison is leaner
than other beef.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.793
I mean, not that I think
you should be eating
any red meat right now.

31:34.927 --> 31:37.930
Please, darling.
I need <i>some</i> pleasures.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.732
Other than you. Mm.

31:44.570 --> 31:48.640
Now, explain to me
what happened.

31:53.845 --> 31:56.148
We lost a driver.

31:58.084 --> 32:00.652
And a shipment.

32:00.786 --> 32:03.522
But it's one of the hazards
of this occupation.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.058
Yeah, I-I don't --
I don't want excuses.

32:06.192 --> 32:09.128
I want solutions.
Who -- Who's responsible?

32:10.629 --> 32:13.465
We don't know yet,
but we're gonna find out,

32:13.599 --> 32:17.836
and we're -- we're gonna get
our stuff back.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.473
Well,
perhaps Tonya can tell me.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.509
Tonya is solid.
Leave her out of this.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.879
These, uh --
These things happen, darling.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.148
You remember
the Hendricks account,

32:29.281 --> 32:30.983
when I misplaced
the decimal --

32:31.117 --> 32:33.519
You caught your mistake
before it cost me anything.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.821
This is not the same.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.324
I have a question.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.492
I need to know
what's going on.

32:40.626 --> 32:44.330
Why are we pulling out
of Canada now?

32:44.463 --> 32:47.199
I know a good opportunity
when I see one.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.670
I mean,
this is <i>your</i> idea.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.239
B-Both of yours, right?

32:53.372 --> 32:56.042
Ren, maybe we
talk about this later.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.509
No,
we're doing this now.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.279
I've been trying to get us
out of Canada for years.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.015
Why is it suddenly
a good idea?

33:03.149 --> 33:05.684
Things change.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.752
Now, eat.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.087
Just tell us
what's going on.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.856
Reenu, I said eat.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.761
Mr. Bhullar.

33:15.894 --> 33:16.928
You have
a telephone call.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.930
Not during family dinner, Donno.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.599
Who is it?

33:20.732 --> 33:22.534
It's good.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.870
Might replace dessert.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.278
You really think
Bob's gonna go to Dietrich?

33:32.411 --> 33:35.781
If he wants to move
what he took, yeah, I do.

33:35.914 --> 33:37.883
And you trust him
to tell you?

33:38.016 --> 33:41.153
Dietrich has no choice
but to trust me.

33:41.287 --> 33:42.821
In the meantime,
roadblocks are set up,

33:42.954 --> 33:44.723
and an APB on the truck.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.727
In with Dietrich,
working the Bhullars.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.497
I got a question
you're not gonna like.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.666
Oh, okay. Well, sure.
It's a free country.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.168
Why haven't you made
an arrest?

33:56.302 --> 33:58.104
I mean, it seems to me
you got what you need

33:58.237 --> 34:00.272
to at least get the Bhullars
out of my town.

34:01.573 --> 34:02.941
Uh, well, I've been on the case
about half a year.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.610
I'm gonna
make it stick.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.978
That means the Bhullars are in
your town a little bit longer.

34:07.113 --> 34:08.447
I don't care.
I don't give a damn.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.117
You, uh...

34:11.250 --> 34:12.784
You got any more questions,
uh, Walt?

34:13.919 --> 34:15.654
No.
Good.

34:15.787 --> 34:17.923
I'll call you, Jenny. Yeah.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.140
What you thinking?

34:34.273 --> 34:36.808
That you don't trust him, either.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.014
What time is this buyer
getting here?

34:43.149 --> 34:44.950
Supposed to be here
an hour ago.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.186
They're drug distributors,
Bob, not Realtors.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.456
How do you know them
again?

34:51.423 --> 34:53.459
You want
every single detail?

34:55.461 --> 34:58.864
They're some guys from Texas
who want to expand west.

34:58.997 --> 35:00.132
I didn't interview them.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.567
I let their money
do the talking.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.136
Isn't that
what you're here for?

35:08.374 --> 35:10.242
What the hell is this?

35:10.376 --> 35:11.677
Told you
we weren't friends.

35:20.319 --> 35:23.054
Mr. Bhullar thanks you.
He'll be in touch.

35:40.071 --> 35:42.841
That should be good.
He's got a little body.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.243
Gonna torture me, huh?

35:44.376 --> 35:47.579
Ooh, I'm shaking
in my boots.

35:47.713 --> 35:48.747
No torture.
We're just gonna kill you,

35:48.880 --> 35:50.549
then dissolve your body
in acid.

35:50.682 --> 35:51.583
It was her idea.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.051
Oh.

35:53.185 --> 35:55.221
Well, it's easier
than digging a hole.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.755
And, plus, it's better
for his back.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.224
Yeah,
the real question is,

35:58.357 --> 36:00.025
are we gonna chop him up
into little pieces

36:00.158 --> 36:03.429
and dissolve those, or do we
just chuck his whole body in?

36:03.562 --> 36:05.431
We could flip a coin.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.437
Ask yourself before you die,
are they in love?

36:13.439 --> 36:14.906
Survivalist Bob:
You let them kill me,

36:15.040 --> 36:16.975
you're never gonna figure out
my secret.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.477
Really?
A man like me
could be of service

36:18.610 --> 36:20.279
to someone
such as yourself.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.748
There's always
a last-ditch effort.

36:22.881 --> 36:23.915
You'll learn this. Mm.

36:24.049 --> 36:25.251
Please, do tell us.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.919
What do you think
is gonna save your life?

36:29.388 --> 36:31.923
Well, for starters,
you have yourselves a mole.

36:32.057 --> 36:33.592
Really?
Mm-hmm.

36:33.725 --> 36:36.061
Do I?

36:37.095 --> 36:38.730
A cop.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.268
Stone.

36:42.401 --> 36:45.437
Stone is a cop.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.447
Hey.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.082
Ren:
<i>Hey, good looking.</i>

36:57.215 --> 36:58.450
<i>I'm gonna need you
to stop by the house.</i>

36:58.584 --> 37:00.586
<i>We have something important
to discuss.</i>

37:00.719 --> 37:01.653
Okay, no problem.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.689
Great.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.491
See you soon.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.144
Ms. Hoyt.

37:26.278 --> 37:27.613
Lila Dodge.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.981
I'm Travis' handler
from State.

37:30.115 --> 37:31.950
I've been trying to reach you,

37:32.083 --> 37:35.186
but we could have done this
over the phone.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.222
Something like this,
I prefer to do face-to-face.

37:37.356 --> 37:40.392
You have concerns
about Travis.

37:40.526 --> 37:41.827
So do I.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.330
So, how long
have you been his handler?

37:44.463 --> 37:46.398
Oh, first things first.

37:46.532 --> 37:48.133
Can I get one of those?

37:49.468 --> 37:52.504
And you might need
a refill yourself.

38:05.551 --> 38:06.585
Hi.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.887
Come on in.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.923
We have company.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.541
I believe you know Bob.

38:31.343 --> 38:32.744
Yeah.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.382
Howdy.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.184
He said some really interesting
things about you.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.688
Such as?
I suddenly don't remember.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.223
Donno, will you give us
the highlights?

38:45.357 --> 38:46.858
He said you're a cop.

38:49.561 --> 38:50.896
Gun.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.102
The small of my back.

39:03.675 --> 39:08.046
So all this time, Travis still
hasn't checked in with you?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.615
No.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.917
Why do you think
that is?

39:14.453 --> 39:16.922
I know he doesn't like
dealing with suits,

39:17.055 --> 39:18.824
thinks they get
in the way.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.259
I used to work undercover.
I can understand that.

39:21.393 --> 39:22.961
Plus,
you're sleeping together,

39:23.094 --> 39:24.430
and I imagine
that makes you... Ooh.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.432
...much more understanding.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.834
Careful. Careful.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.570
We're long past "careful,"
Ms. Hoyt.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.575
What did Travis tell you
about the Bhullars?

39:38.143 --> 39:40.779
He told me
that they killed his partner,

39:40.912 --> 39:42.881
that the case
was personal to him.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.453
Is that not true?

39:48.787 --> 39:51.089
The personal part is.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.501
She's beautiful.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.470
Who is she?

40:04.603 --> 40:06.772
Kate Garza.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.140
She was Veer's
mistress.

40:09.274 --> 40:12.110
Travis turned her
into his informant,

40:12.243 --> 40:14.446
and then he fell in love
with her.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.522
So what happened to her?

40:23.655 --> 40:25.657
Where is she now?
No one knows.

40:25.791 --> 40:28.293
One day,
she just disappeared.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.295
The assumption was,
and still is,

40:30.428 --> 40:34.800
that Veer discovered
she was an informant

40:34.933 --> 40:36.401
and had her killed.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.637
And Travis is trying
to find out?

40:39.471 --> 40:42.608
I believe
he wants more than that.

40:46.377 --> 40:48.146
Okay, Stone --

40:48.279 --> 40:50.015
if that's even
your name...

40:57.989 --> 40:59.591
...are you a cop?

40:59.725 --> 41:01.827
No!
And he's a psychopath.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.029
He's just trying
to save his own ass, Ren.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.430
Come on, you know me.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.432
Do I?

41:07.566 --> 41:09.868
You gonna believe him
over me?

41:10.001 --> 41:12.337
Survivalist Bob:
Of course she is.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.205
She's smart.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.174
And you know what?

41:16.307 --> 41:17.909
This was supposed to be
<i>my</i> last meal,

41:18.043 --> 41:19.878
but, uh...

41:20.011 --> 41:21.379
now it's
going to be yours.

41:21.513 --> 41:22.948
I made it.
It's good.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.550
Okay. Okay. Okay.

41:24.683 --> 41:25.951
You want to kill me,
then let me --

41:26.084 --> 41:28.887
let me ask you a question
before, then, alright?

41:29.020 --> 41:30.455
Would a cop do this?

41:53.879 --> 41:56.214
