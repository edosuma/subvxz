What we're seeing
is a very, very dense layer

50:45.480 --> 50:47.631
at about 200 metres water-depth.

50:47.720 --> 50:49.837
And so, the fact that we have got this

50:49.920 --> 50:55.040
would suggest that we have a very
deep and dense, um, layer of fish.

<i>One of the best ways to film</i>
<i>untouched depths in the open ocean</i>

Good news is
we've just put the ROV down.

51:48.040 --> 51:50.271
We're down at 250 metres,

51:50.360 --> 51:52.875
which means we've gone
to almost the end of the cable,

51:52.960 --> 51:55.759

so we're back in business.

This trip is the perfect illustration

52:20.800 --> 52:22.837
of why we know
so little about the ocean.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.240
We came out looking for something,

52:24.320 --> 52:25.674
we've searched
