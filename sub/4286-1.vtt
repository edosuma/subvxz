What the fuck
is your problem?

01:11.652 --> 01:14.777
No disrespect, Silas.
My bumbaclot Johnson
no working, see?

01:14.777 --> 01:17.318
- What?
- My rassclot true gashman.

01:17.318 --> 01:19.151
My dick won't
stay thick, see?

01:19.151 --> 01:22.151
I think I got
something for that.
Hold on.

01:23.485 --> 01:25.193
Girl,

01:25.193 --> 01:27.151
wake your ass up.

01:27.151 --> 01:29.151
Damn well
you ain't sleeping.

01:31.985 --> 01:33.568
"Crabs,"

01:33.568 --> 01:35.527
"bad breath,"

01:35.527 --> 01:37.485
"limp dick." Ha!

01:38.318 --> 01:39.652
Got that dough?

01:41.944 --> 01:44.652
Will this make
my drill sergeant
stand at attention?

01:44.652 --> 01:46.902
No, but it'll make you forget
your drill sergeant

01:46.902 --> 01:49.318
don't stand at attention.
Get at me in the morning.

01:49.318 --> 01:53.276
- Peace!
- Yo, Silas,
my brother!

01:53.276 --> 01:55.694
Oh, shit, Mikey,
hell no!

01:55.694 --> 01:57.652
Hey, come on, Silas,

01:57.652 --> 02:00.402
I need something
to help me out.

02:00.402 --> 02:03.694
Yeah, rehab, mouthwash,
and a job application.

02:03.694 --> 02:04.860
Jeez.

02:04.860 --> 02:08.235
I'm starting
to recognize things.

02:08.235 --> 02:10.776
That's 'cause you coming down
off a three month crack binge.

02:10.776 --> 02:13.026
It's called reality, son.
Later, man.

02:13.026 --> 02:16.402
Wait, wait, Silas!
You got anything
for a head wound?

02:16.402 --> 02:18.694
Man, ain't nothing wrong
with your head.

02:18.694 --> 02:21.360
( loud crash )

02:22.694 --> 02:25.026
There is now.

02:25.026 --> 02:27.110
( groans )

02:27.110 --> 02:28.694
Fucking crackhead.

02:29.985 --> 02:31.652
Now what?

02:31.652 --> 02:34.026
- Oh, shit, Ive.
- What's up, dog?

02:34.026 --> 02:35.068
( laughs )

02:37.402 --> 02:40.193
- What's up, nigger?
- What's cracking?

02:40.193 --> 02:42.819
Ain't shit, you know.

02:42.819 --> 02:45.610
You get my message
about going to the Jets game?

02:45.610 --> 02:47.068
Yo, I wish I could, dog.

02:47.068 --> 02:49.402
But I got this shorty
coming through tonight.

02:49.402 --> 02:51.235
Met her on the internet.
Chickenheads.com.

02:51.235 --> 02:53.068
This girl is banging.

02:53.068 --> 02:55.568
Yo, we even exchanged
pictures and everything.

02:55.568 --> 02:58.610
- Damn, this look like
your last girlfriend.
- Mm-hmm.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.735
And did your picture
have that nasty

03:00.735 --> 03:03.527
Al B. Sure pubic patch
in it, motherfucker?

03:03.527 --> 03:05.151
This just sprang up.

03:05.151 --> 03:06.860
You know what
I think it is?

03:06.860 --> 03:08.568
It's the mark
of Buddha.

03:08.568 --> 03:10.944
And your haircut game
is fucked up.

03:10.944 --> 03:13.443
Girlfriend see that,
she going to shit on you.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.443
This girl is different.
All she cares about is
Kevin Costner movies.

03:16.443 --> 03:19.276
I'm going to let Kev
do the foreplay, right?

03:19.276 --> 03:22.777
I figured I'd get something
from the Garden of Weeden
to make it interesting.

03:22.777 --> 03:24.735
- Costner, huh?
- Uh-huh.

03:24.735 --> 03:27.276
- "Dances With Wolves."
- "Field Of Dreams."

03:27.276 --> 03:29.527
That's a corny
motherfucker.

03:29.527 --> 03:31.902
You going to need
some strong shit
just to stay awake.

03:31.902 --> 03:33.944
- Come on.
- You're feeling me.

03:33.944 --> 03:36.360
That's a four-hour-
movie-making motherfucker.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.276
Ooh, what is this?

03:38.276 --> 03:40.819
- Huh?
- Ooh whee!

03:40.819 --> 03:44.443
- You shouldn't have.
- I didn't. Get out of here.

03:44.443 --> 03:47.151
- Man, let me just
grab a titty.
- Hell, no.

03:47.151 --> 03:49.527
- She wouldn't even
know it was me.
- To hell with that.

03:49.527 --> 03:51.360
What you got for me?

03:51.360 --> 03:52.777
Here you go.
The bomb.

03:52.777 --> 03:54.735
- Oh, yeah.
What's this?
- Aaah!

03:54.735 --> 03:58.151
Whoa!
Stop touching stuff!

03:58.151 --> 04:01.610
- When are you getting
some funds for this shit?
- See that right there?

04:01.610 --> 04:03.985
That's a natural
aphrodisiac.

04:03.985 --> 04:05.694
Come here, let me show you
some more shit.

04:05.694 --> 04:07.402
Look right there?
See that?

04:07.402 --> 04:09.360
That's a painkiller.
Look under there, bro'.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.026
You see that?
Cure for blueballs.

04:11.026 --> 04:13.485
This ain't shit,
all right? Watch yourself.

04:13.485 --> 04:17.276
Yeah, well, your shit  is
raggedier than a motherfucker.

04:17.276 --> 04:18.735
If you took your head
out these hos

04:18.735 --> 04:20.527
and put 'em
in some books,

04:20.527 --> 04:21.985
you'd have that lab
you always talked about.

04:21.985 --> 04:24.485
Half those books
is filled with bullshit.

04:24.485 --> 04:27.110
The other half lies.
See what I'm saying?

04:27.110 --> 04:29.151
I got to give Pops
his medicine, man.

04:29.151 --> 04:31.151
I'm hungrier
than four dudes.

04:31.151 --> 04:33.985
Hey, I'm hungrier
than five.

04:33.985 --> 04:36.485
Who is you and what you
doing in my house?

04:36.485 --> 04:38.068
I went for
"Pork Chops O'Chunky."

04:38.068 --> 04:40.110
Whether you're black,
or honky, or in-between,

04:40.110 --> 04:43.235
you'll love
"Pork Chops O'Chunky."
Man, that's mean.

04:43.235 --> 04:45.944
- So what's in this stuff?
- Nothing but pork.

04:45.944 --> 04:48.193
Wow, right on, then!

04:48.193 --> 04:52.568
- There you go.
- You're scared
to answer your calling.

04:52.568 --> 04:54.652
Man, what calling?

04:54.652 --> 04:56.860
♪ Pork Chops O'Chunky ♪

04:56.860 --> 04:58.652
♪ Tastes real good ♪

04:58.652 --> 05:01.360
♪ Won't make you
never smell funky, yeah... ♪

05:01.360 --> 05:03.735
You got an opportunity
to do something here...

05:03.735 --> 05:05.860
that the drug companies
would never do.

05:05.860 --> 05:08.985
Let's put the power of healing
back into the hands
of the common man.

05:08.985 --> 05:10.735
Whatever, man.
What you need to do

05:10.735 --> 05:13.193
is concentrate on getting
the power of booty

05:13.193 --> 05:16.360
into the hands
of your common ass.
That's what you need.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.735
Don't worry about the Ive.
I got mine coming tonight.

05:18.735 --> 05:22.068
- WOMAN: Hey, Silas!
- You see the ass
on the red one?

05:22.068 --> 05:25.402
- Simple.
- Just remember
to take them THCs.

05:25.402 --> 05:27.402
At least try
to get into college.

05:27.402 --> 05:29.568
Working in a real lab,
making some real money.

05:30.443 --> 05:32.402
Okay, Ive,
whatever, man.

05:32.402 --> 05:35.151
- If you say so, bro'.
- The world is bigger
than Staten Island.

05:35.151 --> 05:37.568
I'm out.

05:41.068 --> 05:43.568
- Holler at me.
- I'll try to.

05:43.568 --> 05:45.360
- What's up, ladies?
- Yo, Si,

05:45.360 --> 05:48.068
if I got hit by a bus tomorrow,
I got your back.

05:48.068 --> 05:50.402
If anything happened to me,
or I jumped out a window

05:50.402 --> 05:52.944
and my hair caught on fire,
I got your back, dog.

05:52.944 --> 05:55.485
If my ex came after me
with a knife and stabbed me,

05:55.485 --> 05:58.360
- I got your back!
- You talk too much, Ive.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.318
- Peace!
- Yo, Silas!

06:00.318 --> 06:02.443
You'd better take
those college exams!

06:03.777 --> 06:06.235
WOMAN:
Look at Jamal,
he's a good boy, huh?

06:06.235 --> 06:09.610
Good boy, my ass.
I had to cancel
my nail appointment

06:09.610 --> 06:12.652
to pick him up
at the precinct last week.

06:12.652 --> 06:14.985
- Momma, they lying.
- They lying?

06:14.985 --> 06:17.944
- They found the weed
on you, didn't they?
- It wasn't mine.

06:17.944 --> 06:21.694
Then what is this
that I found in your bedroom?

06:21.694 --> 06:24.402
Hello.
Ma, it is a lamp.

06:24.402 --> 06:27.777
And this is where
you turn it on at.
Excuse me?

06:27.777 --> 06:29.568
Head.

06:35.068 --> 06:38.443
Now, where did I go wrong
with your ass?

06:38.443 --> 06:40.568
You going to have to take
that THC test

06:40.568 --> 06:42.026
and get into
a four-year college

06:42.026 --> 06:43.985
or I'm just cut you off
from this family.

06:43.985 --> 06:47.652
You are the first member
of this family

06:47.652 --> 06:49.819
to go to college.

06:49.819 --> 06:52.151
But six years
at a two-year
community college

06:52.151 --> 06:53.985
is not what
I had in mind.

06:53.985 --> 06:56.652
- BOTH: Tell the truth.
- I got a dream that one day

06:56.652 --> 06:58.610
I can put
your college diploma here

06:58.610 --> 07:00.902
under my Jesus,
who's master of this house,

07:00.902 --> 07:04.568
next to your brother's
prison-issue barber certificate

07:04.568 --> 07:07.026
and your sister's
weave-master degree.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.985
Now don't disappoint me.

07:08.985 --> 07:11.819
You weed smoking,
three-day-wearing nasty ass.

07:11.819 --> 07:13.860
Just like your father.

07:13.860 --> 07:17.485
Why you always
talking to me like that
in front of company?

07:17.485 --> 07:19.652
These bitches ain't nobody.

07:19.652 --> 07:21.860
Now go warm me up
some "Pork Chops O'Chunky."

07:21.860 --> 07:25.193
- Is that all, Momma?
- Wash your nasty ass!

07:25.193 --> 07:28.026
Is that all, Momma?

07:28.026 --> 07:30.527
( knocking on door )

07:31.443 --> 07:33.360
You the man.

07:34.527 --> 07:38.819
- What's up, baby?
- Oh, hell no!

07:40.193 --> 07:42.944
I didn't know
you had dreads!
And what is that?

07:42.944 --> 07:46.151
Brother just got
extensions put in today.
They tight, huh?

07:46.151 --> 07:48.777
Where?
Between your eyes?

07:48.777 --> 07:51.819
- What the hell is that?
- It's the mark of Buddha.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.193
It's the skidmark
of Buddha!

07:54.193 --> 07:56.860
Looks like he took a dump
in the middle of your face!

07:56.860 --> 07:59.902
- I don't think this is
gonna work out.
- Hold on, now!

07:59.902 --> 08:03.568
Why are you doing this?
I rented "Field Of Dreams"
and "Dances With Wolves."

08:03.568 --> 08:06.610
Nigger, you are a wolf.

08:06.610 --> 08:09.527
Chocolate diva!
Nubian goddess!

08:10.402 --> 08:13.819
I'm taking you off
my buddy list, bitch!

08:13.819 --> 08:16.610
I hope you get a virus!
You and your computer.

08:16.610 --> 08:18.193
( tires squealing )

08:18.193 --> 08:21.151
MAN:
If you build it,
they will come.

08:21.151 --> 08:23.068
MAN #2:
What you mean they'll come?

08:23.068 --> 08:25.068
Who's going to come
to a fucking cornfield?

08:25.068 --> 08:27.402
Who's going to cut
the grass?

08:27.402 --> 08:30.110
I know you don't expect
me to sell no peanuts
out there, bitch.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.025
Shit remind me of slavery.
"Roots" and shit, man.

08:33.025 --> 08:34.985
- ( laughing )
- I don't play this, man.

08:34.985 --> 08:38.150
- What was that?  Annie!
- Crazy ho!

08:38.150 --> 08:41.693
Only way I'm coming is
if you got some females
and some chronic.

08:41.693 --> 08:44.150
And then we all
going to be coming.

08:44.150 --> 08:46.735
- That voice, what was it?
- We didn't hear anything!

08:46.735 --> 08:49.694
She got some
nice titties, dog. Word.

08:49.694 --> 08:51.985
CHILD:
What titties?  What?

08:51.985 --> 08:54.443
MAN #2:
Okay, you must've heard that!

08:54.443 --> 08:56.443
WOMAN:
It's a good
baseball field, Ray.

08:56.443 --> 08:58.777
RAY:
It's kind of pretty.

08:58.777 --> 09:00.985
- I told you.
- You did not.

09:00.985 --> 09:03.527
- I did.
- No, you did not.

09:03.527 --> 09:06.443
( hip-hop music playing )

09:07.360 --> 09:09.193
( screaming )

09:09.193 --> 09:11.443
Oh God! Oh!

09:20.193 --> 09:22.110
SILAS:
Mark of Buddha, my ass.

09:22.110 --> 09:24.443
Look at you now.
Dead. Ashes.

09:24.443 --> 09:26.610
Damn, Ivory.

09:26.610 --> 09:28.360
After all these years
of blazing,

09:28.360 --> 09:31.318
who would've thought
the last thing you'd
wind up smoking

09:31.318 --> 09:34.735
would be your  ass?
I'm gonna miss you, dog.

09:34.735 --> 09:38.568
I'm going to be thinking
about you while I'm
taking them THCs.

09:38.568 --> 09:40.276
And if you're
really my boy,

09:40.276 --> 09:43.110
you'll make sure I pass
that motherfucker,
you heard?

09:44.068 --> 09:45.527
Thanks, Pops.

09:45.527 --> 09:48.527
What's up with that joint?
Can I get a little--

09:48.527 --> 09:51.110
Never mind.
Forget it.

09:51.110 --> 09:53.318
Bald-ass
motherfucker.

09:53.318 --> 09:55.485
Stingy bastard.

09:56.694 --> 09:58.610
Shit.

10:00.151 --> 10:03.193
"Early girl."

10:03.193 --> 10:07.985
Ooh, Ivory.
My how you've grown.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.735
( sniffs )
Wow.

10:12.735 --> 10:15.318
Damn, Ivory!

10:15.318 --> 10:18.360
I had no idea you could
stink so good, nigger!

10:18.360 --> 10:20.360
Jeez.

10:24.735 --> 10:28.318
MAN:
Hey, man,
get that car fixed!

10:28.318 --> 10:31.860
Blunt o'clock, boy.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.652
( engine knocking )

10:40.860 --> 10:43.485
Man, get the fuck
out of here.

10:43.485 --> 10:46.318
Look at this little ass bag
of fucking weed.

10:46.318 --> 10:48.318
( sniffs )

10:48.318 --> 10:51.694
Yes, Lord.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.402
Oooh. Damn!

10:57.568 --> 11:00.068
- ( flatulence )
- Oooh.

11:01.235 --> 11:03.568
Aw.

11:06.068 --> 11:07.610
- ( air blowing )
- Oh, oh!

11:07.610 --> 11:11.068
Oh! Oh, shit!
My weed!

11:12.735 --> 11:15.819
No cigar? No!

11:15.819 --> 11:18.527
Fuck, fuck! Bitch!

11:18.527 --> 11:20.902
( muffled cursing )

11:27.026 --> 11:28.694
Got blunt?

11:30.151 --> 11:32.902
Got weed?

11:32.902 --> 11:35.985
That shit smell
good as hell.
I'm Jamal.

11:35.985 --> 11:37.151
Peace. Silas.

11:37.151 --> 11:38.860
So you trying
to get something

11:38.860 --> 11:40.527
to bring them
nerves down too, huh?

11:40.527 --> 11:43.235
I figured if I study high,
take the tests high,

11:43.235 --> 11:46.735
- I'll get
high scores, right?
- Right.

11:46.735 --> 11:48.402
- Right.
- Right.

11:50.568 --> 11:54.235
- Look at that car.
- Is it on fire?

11:54.235 --> 11:57.110
( coughing )
Take that, son.

12:02.777 --> 12:04.443
( gagging )

12:04.443 --> 12:06.610
( coughing )

12:09.652 --> 12:11.944
Oh!

12:11.944 --> 12:14.318
Yo...

12:14.318 --> 12:17.318
- This is the shit.
- That shit is called
the Ivory shit.

12:17.318 --> 12:19.735
- It's the shit.
- That's the Ivory right there.

12:19.735 --> 12:22.819
- Goddamn.
- Thanks.

12:22.819 --> 12:25.151
- Oops.
- Yo, pass that, kid.

12:26.485 --> 12:28.902
I just gave it
to the guy in the back, man.

12:28.902 --> 12:31.318
Guy in the back?
Fuck is he--?

12:31.318 --> 12:33.568
- What's up, dog?
- That's Ivory.

12:33.568 --> 12:37.068
No, that's the Ivory.
Damn.

12:37.068 --> 12:39.777
Ivory?! Oh, shit!
You got to be kidding me!

12:39.777 --> 12:41.819
Yo, Silas!
Chill out! Silas!

12:42.694 --> 12:44.527
Word.

12:44.527 --> 12:46.360
What the fuck
is going on?

12:46.360 --> 12:48.652
Ain't you supposed
to be dead?

12:48.652 --> 12:51.276
I am dead.
But this is what happens
when you smoke your boy.

12:51.276 --> 12:53.735
Holy shit.
Let me try that.

12:53.735 --> 12:56.318
IVORY:
Relax.  Can we talk
about this in your car?

12:56.318 --> 12:58.694
I know how you can
get high scores.

13:04.276 --> 13:07.985
IVORY:
I'm a ghost, ghost, ghost.

13:07.985 --> 13:11.610
- Now, don't touch me.
- It's me, dog.

13:11.610 --> 13:14.777
What are you doing?
Running the streets,
fucking with the living?

13:14.777 --> 13:16.944
No, bro'.
I'm just here for you.

13:16.944 --> 13:19.652
People can only see me
when they smoke me.

13:19.652 --> 13:23.068
I got all the answers.
I can consult with people.

13:23.068 --> 13:24.527
Socrates, Nietzsche,

13:24.527 --> 13:26.276
even the old dude
who made this test.

13:26.276 --> 13:27.944
- That's bullshit.
- I bullshit you not.

13:27.944 --> 13:29.735
Remember, I told you
I have your back--

13:29.735 --> 13:31.860
even if I got hit
by a bus.

13:31.860 --> 13:33.777
Matter of fact, your ass didn't
even get hit by a bus.

13:33.777 --> 13:35.360
( screaming )

13:39.068 --> 13:40.485
I made it!

13:40.485 --> 13:44.068
I can't feel my legs,
but I'm alive!

13:47.151 --> 13:49.068
( horn honking,
screaming )

13:51.652 --> 13:54.068
- And you predicted
that shit.
- Yeah.

13:54.068 --> 13:56.235
So what are
you doing here?

13:56.235 --> 13:58.735
Are you going
to hook me up with a chick
with a no-gag reflex?

13:58.735 --> 14:01.485
Even better. I'm going to be
in there with you.

14:01.485 --> 14:04.860
By the time I'm done with you,
every college in the country
will be knocking.

14:07.985 --> 14:11.193
Ow, shit.
Man, I must not be high enough.

14:11.193 --> 14:12.819
He a ghost, man.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.193
Cool.
That explains everything.

14:15.193 --> 14:19.193
I'm up here trying to put
my fucking hand through--

14:19.193 --> 14:23.068
We've never had anybody,
let alone two people

14:23.068 --> 14:24.902
get a perfect score.

14:24.902 --> 14:27.443
We either have a one
in six billion phenomenon,

14:27.443 --> 14:29.527
or a cheat.

14:29.527 --> 14:32.610
- Damn!
- It would've been impossible
for either of you to cheat.

14:32.610 --> 14:35.443
You had two totally different
versions of the test.

14:35.443 --> 14:37.694
Congratulations.
These scores are going

14:37.694 --> 14:40.443
to get you into any college
in the country.

14:40.443 --> 14:42.777
Yo, we still high
on that Ivory?

14:49.443 --> 14:52.485
Cain, it's as simple as this.

14:52.485 --> 14:54.777
The trustees are
riding my ass

14:54.777 --> 14:57.235
about getting
some color up
at Harvard.

14:57.235 --> 14:59.610
- Excuse me?
- Ethnic diversity.

14:59.610 --> 15:01.777
The trustees seem
to think we need it.

15:01.777 --> 15:04.568
- How come we don't have
more minorities?
- How should I know?

15:04.568 --> 15:07.485
If we don't
do something soon,
I might get fired.

15:07.485 --> 15:10.276
What about Upchuck Amalu?
He's Eskimo.

15:10.276 --> 15:13.068
Why isn't
he considered as a minority?
And I  brought him in.

15:13.068 --> 15:16.026
But it's breaking the bank
keeping his igloo frozen.

15:16.026 --> 15:18.944
Dean, what about those
two guys I read about
from the Tri-states?

15:18.944 --> 15:21.902
They made perfect scores
on their THCs.

15:21.902 --> 15:25.110
I saw those guys' pictures.
They looked like mug shots!

15:27.110 --> 15:29.652
I don't care.
I want them!

15:29.652 --> 15:31.819
At Reparations
Technical Institute,

15:31.819 --> 15:34.360
we offer a cornucopia
of educational

15:34.360 --> 15:37.568
and  business opportunities
for brothers and sisters
to pursue higher learning.

15:37.568 --> 15:40.110
- Read from the brochure.
- "Brothers, join us

15:40.110 --> 15:41.985
and learn hatred
for the white devil

15:41.985 --> 15:43.443
in a relaxed campus
atmosphere,

15:43.443 --> 15:45.360
- where classes range..."
- From...

15:45.360 --> 15:47.276
- "Hatred For
The White Devil..."
- to...

15:47.276 --> 15:49.568
- "Advanced Hatred
For The White Devil..."
- and...

15:49.568 --> 15:51.026
- "Volleyball."
- BOTH: next.

15:51.026 --> 15:53.568
You think you're all
hot tamales right now?

15:53.568 --> 15:55.819
Why don't you come
to the base and understand

15:55.819 --> 15:57.652
what it's really like
to be special?

15:57.652 --> 15:59.193
You work hard, you learn,

15:59.193 --> 16:01.860
and then you can build
refrigerators and such.

16:01.860 --> 16:02.944
Next!

16:02.944 --> 16:04.902
Taking a vow of celibacy...

16:04.902 --> 16:06.360
- Next.
- ...frees your mind...

16:06.360 --> 16:07.402
- Next.
- ...and your body.

16:07.402 --> 16:08.610
Next!

16:08.610 --> 16:10.610
Harvard?!

16:10.610 --> 16:12.860
Ain't it a lot
of richy people
up there?

16:12.860 --> 16:15.819
Shit, I got to roll up
that joint, dog.

16:15.819 --> 16:19.026
With test scores like these
you can roll up any joint
you want.

16:19.026 --> 16:21.360
But Harvard, gentlemen,
is not just any joint.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.694
- It's an institution.
- All I want to do is
develop my herbal

16:24.694 --> 16:27.985
in a real lab,
and get some head
while I'm doing it.

16:27.985 --> 16:30.402
( chuckling )

16:30.402 --> 16:32.694
We have the finest
Botany department in the world

16:32.694 --> 16:35.318
and a quality of life
like no other.

16:35.318 --> 16:38.902
Music, artists,
and the women... mmm.

16:38.902 --> 16:42.568
So, does it sound tempting?
Ivy league atmosphere?

16:42.568 --> 16:45.610
A place where you can
really grow academically?

16:45.610 --> 16:49.068
- Sure, I'll fucks with ya.
- I'll fucks with you, too.

16:49.068 --> 16:51.318
- Is that good?
- Yes, that's a yes.

16:51.318 --> 16:53.068
Then we'll fox
with each other.

17:05.068 --> 17:07.694
- Damn.
- Damn.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.026
SILAS:
Them hos look like
they still in high school, yo.

17:11.026 --> 17:14.318
If there's grass
on the infield,
play ball.

17:14.318 --> 17:16.902
Where the fuck is
orientation at, anyway?

17:16.902 --> 17:20.443
BOTH:
Da-amn.

17:20.443 --> 17:22.609
- Hey!
- ( howls )

17:23.609 --> 17:26.276
- What the fuck was that?
- Je-sus!

17:28.109 --> 17:31.443
If I could pull off six years
out of community college,

17:31.443 --> 17:34.443
I know I could get
a least 12 years up
in this motherfucker.

17:34.443 --> 17:36.026
( chuckles )

17:36.026 --> 17:38.276
How much of that Ivory
we got, anyway?

17:38.276 --> 17:41.068
We limited, all right?
So we're going to have
to split this shit up.

17:41.068 --> 17:44.193
You know what I'm saying?
We only blaze at test times.

17:44.193 --> 17:47.443
- What, no wake and bake?
- I got other stuff for that.

17:50.402 --> 17:54.026
Bart, remember those artifacts
I found this summer?

17:54.026 --> 17:56.652
I was right!
They are Ben Franklin's!

17:56.652 --> 17:59.819
Great. Did you figure out
where you want to eat
dinner tonight?

17:59.819 --> 18:03.318
Dinner?
Bart, some of these
things are--

18:03.318 --> 18:05.193
they look like
earlier inventions.

18:05.193 --> 18:07.485
And if I can discover
what these are,

18:07.485 --> 18:10.068
it could be the greatest find
of anyone attending Harvard.

18:10.068 --> 18:13.694
I loves Ben Franklin, girl,
and I could listen to you

18:13.694 --> 18:17.694
talk about his stinking ass
all day long.

18:17.694 --> 18:21.944
- Excuse me?
- Do anybody know where
the financial aid office is?

18:21.944 --> 18:24.110
Well, my man,
let me think.

18:24.110 --> 18:27.193
See that statue right there?
It's beautiful, isn't it?

18:27.193 --> 18:30.110
That statue is in the likeness
of my great grandaddy Dooster.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.777
So I'm guessing that
would be the Dooster house.

18:32.777 --> 18:36.694
The financial aid office.
Gee, I don't think

18:36.694 --> 18:39.527
I've ever met anyone
who actually needed to go there.

18:39.527 --> 18:41.860
All we did was come over
and ask for directions.

18:41.860 --> 18:44.860
If we came over here
and asked if anybody needed
their ass kicked,

18:44.860 --> 18:47.026
you wouldn't sound
so fucking smart, would you?

18:47.026 --> 18:50.694
My bad, bro'. We got off
on the wrong foot.
Let's start over.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.777
- I'm Bart.
- I'm Jamal.

18:52.777 --> 18:55.819
My friend, this is crew,
but don't even think about it.

18:55.819 --> 18:58.402
You don't look like
you could hang, Jermaine.

18:58.402 --> 19:01.276
The name's Jamal,
and I'll fuck your crew up.

19:01.276 --> 19:03.360
Who are they?
Who are they, goddamn it?

19:03.360 --> 19:04.860
It's rowing,
Jimmy-Jam.

19:04.860 --> 19:07.652
Well, Bart-Fart,
you got skills in it?

19:07.652 --> 19:09.568
Yeah, I'm captain
of the team.

19:09.568 --> 19:12.151
- If you can do it,
I can do it, sucker.
- That's right.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.110
This isn't
basketball, J-Rock.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.193
I trained all year round
for three seasons

19:17.193 --> 19:19.068
to make number one
in single sculls.

19:19.068 --> 19:22.193
You about to be number two,
'cause I'm signing up, buddy.

19:22.193 --> 19:24.318
Practice starts tomorrow,
6:00 am. A'ight?

19:24.318 --> 19:29.068
Fine. I don't mind
cutting my evening short
to be there.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.902
As Dean of Freshmen,

19:30.902 --> 19:33.610
I have welcomed students
from all over the world.

19:33.610 --> 19:38.026
From Korea, from Rome,
Istanbul.

19:38.026 --> 19:40.276
Students enter Harvard

19:40.276 --> 19:42.777
with a variety of goals.

19:42.777 --> 19:45.985
Excuse me?
Are we in the right place?

19:45.985 --> 19:49.193
- Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?
- You? You?

19:49.193 --> 19:52.527
As I was saying,

19:52.527 --> 19:55.110
Harvard isn't for everyone.

19:55.110 --> 19:58.110
Oh, shit.
We got a black man
for a teacher.

19:58.110 --> 20:00.360
That's what I'm
talking 'bout!
What's up, bro'?

20:00.360 --> 20:02.443
- We straight.
- Holler!

20:04.235 --> 20:06.777
- As I was saying...
- What's wrong with his ass?

20:06.777 --> 20:08.985
He probably been locked up
more times than me

20:08.985 --> 20:11.193
- and your ass put together.
- Get him.

20:11.193 --> 20:14.026
That old, green, Jimmy
The Cricket suit-wearing
ass motherfucker.

20:14.026 --> 20:17.527
- Get him!
- Old, short, Colin Powell
haircut-having motherfucker.

20:17.527 --> 20:21.485
- Get him!
- Angela Davis moustache
wearing-ass motherfucker.

20:21.485 --> 20:24.193
You little Richard Pryor
shortcut fade

20:24.193 --> 20:27.276
happening 'round the sides
wearing motherfucker!

20:27.276 --> 20:31.193
You little Sammy Davis Award
Junior Afro haircut having-ass
motherfucker!

20:31.193 --> 20:34.694
- Get him!
- You little dynamite
disco daddy devastating.

20:34.694 --> 20:37.819
- Get him!
- You little Don Cornelius
with a haircut--

20:37.819 --> 20:41.694
Gentlemen, if you don't mind,
I'd like you to sit down.

20:41.694 --> 20:43.485
I would like to continue.

20:43.485 --> 20:47.860
- Excuse me.
- 'Scuse me.

20:47.860 --> 20:49.527
JAMAL:
Watch your toes.
Watch the corns.

20:49.527 --> 20:52.151
- Excuse me.
- ( flatulent sound )

20:52.151 --> 20:55.694
Thank you for your...
entertaining anecdotes.

20:55.694 --> 21:00.318
We here at Harvard
are rooted in tradition.

21:00.318 --> 21:02.652
Fuck is this?

21:02.652 --> 21:04.735
- That's toilet water.
- ( spits )

21:04.735 --> 21:07.485
It's a part of my pledge.
Do you guys mind?

21:07.485 --> 21:09.985
No. But do you mind
talking that way,

21:09.985 --> 21:12.276
'cause your breath smell
like straight ass-crack, bro'.

21:12.276 --> 21:15.443
Isn't there
a hip-hop convention
you two should be at?

21:15.443 --> 21:16.985
- Ooooh.
- Oooh.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.985
- Shark has fangs.
- Word. Go easy on him.

21:19.985 --> 21:23.443
We probably
the only blackheads he's seen
since he looked in the mirror.

21:23.443 --> 21:25.860
Can you guys just show
a little respect? Jeez.

21:25.860 --> 21:28.026
This class is fucking boring,
I'm out of here.

21:28.026 --> 21:30.151
Excuse me,
did I hear you
say something?

21:30.151 --> 21:31.902
With all due respect, sir,
suck my dick.

21:31.902 --> 21:33.527
( all gasp )

21:33.527 --> 21:36.860
No, sir, I'm not
saying anything.

21:36.860 --> 21:39.819
- It's these guys.
- SILAS: You're an asshole.

21:39.819 --> 21:42.485
- Did you just
call me an asshole?
- No, I said idiot.

21:42.485 --> 21:45.276
- An idiot?!
- No, sir! No, sir!

21:45.276 --> 21:48.026
- What did you say?
- I said this school
has nice halls.

21:48.026 --> 21:51.193
- This is not funny.
- You couldn't teach your way
out of kindergarten class.

21:51.193 --> 21:53.777
I think we've had enough
interruptions for today.

21:53.777 --> 21:56.527
- I think you should leave.
- Sir.

21:57.985 --> 22:00.402
This would never have
happened if I were black.

22:04.652 --> 22:06.568
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:06.568 --> 22:08.527
Better pull back
on those pedals, boy.

22:08.527 --> 22:11.735
- Why?
- Maximum speed on campus
is 15 MPHs.

22:11.735 --> 22:13.568
MPHs?

22:14.694 --> 22:17.402
50 bucks?
Man, I can't pay this.

22:17.402 --> 22:20.026
- Well...
- This isn't
even a real ticket.

22:20.026 --> 22:22.318
It's a student citation.
See, I'm a volunteer.

22:22.318 --> 22:24.860
You need to pay that
by Friday at fi--

22:24.860 --> 22:28.151
- That was uncalled for.
- Eat me.

22:28.151 --> 22:31.735
- You just earned
another citation.
- Fuck off!

22:32.985 --> 22:36.944
- ( horn honking )
- Well, well, well.

22:36.944 --> 22:39.527
Look who we have here.

22:39.527 --> 22:41.443
Damn, this bike
phat as hell.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.026
Whoa, whoa,
hey, don't touch.
Okay, all right.

22:44.026 --> 22:46.318
Leave the bike alone.
Did you just call me fat?

22:46.318 --> 22:48.318
And what is that stench?

22:48.318 --> 22:50.235
( sniffing )

22:50.235 --> 22:52.110
That's my cologne.
Cannabi For Men.

22:52.110 --> 22:54.860
I don't know what that is.
Forewarning, gentlemen.

22:54.860 --> 22:57.193
You better watch your mouths
and your behinds.

22:57.193 --> 23:00.318
I'm looking for the Ecstasy.
I'm looking for the pot.

23:00.318 --> 23:03.151
Oh, yeah. I'm looking
for those 'shrooms.

23:03.151 --> 23:05.944
- We looking
for that shit, too!
- Hell yeah.

23:05.944 --> 23:09.026
- What are you talking about?
- BOTH: Same thing you
talking about.

23:09.026 --> 23:11.944
- What are we talking about?
- Look, Gerald,

23:11.944 --> 23:15.276
either you're holding,
or you can get on your roadster
and move the fuck on.

23:15.276 --> 23:17.694
It's Volunteer Officer
Picklestein.

23:17.694 --> 23:20.151
And I am watching you.
Oh, I'm watching you.

23:20.151 --> 23:22.110
Like a hawk.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.193
Like a hawk!

23:25.193 --> 23:27.819
Somebody needs a hug.

23:30.902 --> 23:34.485
Don't worry, baby,
you can suck my dick
after class.

23:36.026 --> 23:38.068
Oh, wow!
She wants me.

23:38.068 --> 23:41.151
Welcome to Lovell House.
You look funky fresh.

23:41.151 --> 23:45.151
And funky fresh always likes
funky fresh women.

23:46.568 --> 23:50.527
"Amir, professional student,
resident advisor for you."

23:50.527 --> 23:51.944
And professional player.

23:51.944 --> 23:54.485
So what's mine is yours,
and what's yours...

23:54.485 --> 23:55.985
I've probably already had.

23:55.985 --> 23:59.360
You and you and me,
we're the same.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.819
Africa tan.

24:00.819 --> 24:03.360
The original man
was like us, man.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.151
Whatever, nigger.

24:05.151 --> 24:08.068
I believe in the Fly Club
and its traditions
and its ideals.

24:08.068 --> 24:10.276
I believe in the Fly--
Excuse me?

24:10.276 --> 24:12.610
Do you have
to play that so loud?
I'm studying my pledge book.

24:12.610 --> 24:15.068
This Niggaz With Attitude.

24:15.068 --> 24:18.360
If you smart,
you tell people
you love NWA.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.360
They think you cool.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.527
( rap music playing )

24:22.527 --> 24:25.068
Why do you wear
smelly eggs?

24:25.068 --> 24:27.402
These eggs are part
of my pledging.

24:27.402 --> 24:30.193
I am getting thousands
of lifetime connections here.

24:30.193 --> 24:32.068
I'm going to be a part
of a fraternity.

24:32.068 --> 24:33.402
- Hey!
- Hey!

24:33.402 --> 24:34.860
Whassup, whassup?

24:34.860 --> 24:38.527
- Oh God.
- One glove, my brothers!

24:39.568 --> 24:42.360
I am Tuan,
child prodigy.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.694
I'm Jamal,
a pothead.

24:45.527 --> 24:48.026
Silas, entre-po-negro.

24:48.026 --> 24:51.902
Jamal!
Fresh gear, man!

24:51.902 --> 24:53.485
- You like?
- Yeah!

24:53.485 --> 24:56.235
I designed it myself.
I call it Bufu.

24:56.235 --> 24:58.902
- Bufu?
- Oh, no, not you two.

24:58.902 --> 25:00.360
Please.

25:00.360 --> 25:03.235
Fake-ass Paul Bunyan plaid,
pussy shirt wearing--

25:03.235 --> 25:05.902
Man, I'll fuck your ass up.
Shut up.

25:05.902 --> 25:07.402
Okay, but if you two
are our roommates,

25:07.402 --> 25:09.819
who's that?

25:09.819 --> 25:12.402
That's "I Need Money."
Goddamn.

25:14.485 --> 25:16.735
Okay, but what's his name?

25:17.694 --> 25:21.068
I Need Money.

25:23.402 --> 25:24.777
Doesn't talk,
how come he?

25:24.777 --> 25:27.318
I need money?
He's a mute.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.944
When we first hooked up,
he wrote on a slip of paper,

25:29.944 --> 25:31.694
"I need money."

25:31.694 --> 25:34.110
I said, "Shit, me too."

25:34.110 --> 25:36.610
And we started making it
together after that.

25:36.610 --> 25:39.527
- Where he staying?
- Harvard.

25:39.527 --> 25:42.944
Lovell House.
Second floor,

25:42.944 --> 25:45.068
right on the couch.

25:45.068 --> 25:47.860
He's smoking in our room.
That's not legal.

25:47.860 --> 25:51.443
Just be cool,
and you might have
some fun this semester.

25:51.443 --> 25:54.235
- Stupid.
- Whoo-wee.

25:54.235 --> 25:57.610
NWA? Kid,
what you know about that?

25:57.610 --> 26:00.443
Yeah, I love
Niggaz With Attitude.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.777
Nobody, I repeat nobody,

26:04.777 --> 26:06.819
drops the N-bomb
up in here.

26:06.819 --> 26:08.902
- Nobody.
- That go for you, too.

26:08.902 --> 26:12.068
Hey, I am
down with you, man.

26:12.068 --> 26:15.610
You East coast.
I Far East coast.

26:15.610 --> 26:17.819
I'm from Wisconsin.

26:17.819 --> 26:20.026
Yo, fresh and funky.

26:20.026 --> 26:22.193
Dean Cain wants
to see you in his office.

26:22.193 --> 26:24.110
Don't be late.

26:25.777 --> 26:27.944
Gentlemen,
this institution

26:27.944 --> 26:31.652
has graduated countless
Fortune 500 CEOs.

26:31.652 --> 26:34.860
41 Nobel laureates,
and six Presidents.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.318
Hey, Dean, where's
all the fly-ass women

26:37.318 --> 26:39.485
the Chancellor was
talking about?

26:39.485 --> 26:42.777
So far, I only seen
some stuck-up,

26:42.777 --> 26:44.985
nerdy-ass looking
women out.

26:47.860 --> 26:50.485
( clock ticking )

26:56.527 --> 26:59.652
You were dropping Cheetos

26:59.652 --> 27:01.985
on an original 18th century

27:01.985 --> 27:03.527
hand woven tapestry!

27:03.527 --> 27:05.735
You mean this carpet?

27:05.735 --> 27:08.527
This is out
of my personal collection.

27:08.527 --> 27:11.110
I got this
in my travels to Nepal!

27:11.110 --> 27:12.735
I know the bitch
that makes these rugs.

27:12.735 --> 27:15.026
- You know Wynena--
- I remember that bitch.

27:15.026 --> 27:17.026
It means the world to me.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.360
Now, as I was saying,

27:19.360 --> 27:22.735
here at Harvard,
we have very high standards.

27:22.735 --> 27:25.193
Any student
on a scholarship

27:25.193 --> 27:28.402
must maintain at least
a 2.0 average

27:28.402 --> 27:29.985
or you will be expelled.

27:29.985 --> 27:32.527
It's good to know
we have the support
of the faculty.

27:32.527 --> 27:35.568
And don't you worry.
Me and Jamal here?

27:35.568 --> 27:38.276
- We're all about good grades.
- Is that right, Mr. King?

27:38.276 --> 27:42.568

Taxi!

29:21.443 --> 29:24.110
Woo, what took
you all guys so long?

29:24.110 --> 29:27.360
Coach, I've not lost
an oar run in three years.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.068
- I'm wondering
if this guy cheated.
- Cheated?

29:30.068 --> 29:31.485
Man, fuck you!

29:31.485 --> 29:34.276
Why is fucking Dick Butt-kiss
always riding me?

29:34.276 --> 29:37.985
Dick Butt-kiss?
Did you hear that, Coach?
He's cursing!

29:37.985 --> 29:40.652
Bart, I think you better
go open up the boathouse.

29:40.652 --> 29:42.110
- But Coach!
- Bart!

29:42.110 --> 29:44.026
I don't think
you want to see this.

29:45.026 --> 29:46.944
You... here.

29:46.944 --> 29:48.694
Come here.

29:48.694 --> 29:50.527
Come here.

29:52.735 --> 29:55.735
Nice comeback
on the Dick Butt-kiss.

29:55.735 --> 29:57.860
I wish I could've
said that.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.819
His parents have been
driving me crazy,

29:59.819 --> 30:02.318
making my life a misery
for years.

30:02.318 --> 30:05.026
But they give lots of money.
I have to go to those lousy
cocktail parties.

30:05.026 --> 30:07.735
She has lousy perfume
and he has a lousy toupee.

30:07.735 --> 30:10.777
You keep throwing
zingers to this jerk-off,

30:10.777 --> 30:12.860
and you're going
to make the team, son.

30:14.527 --> 30:17.026
And let that be
a lesson to you!
This is the last time!

30:17.026 --> 30:19.527
All right, rookies!
Push-ups!

30:19.527 --> 30:21.068
Get down!

30:22.777 --> 30:25.694
Yo, yo, yo.
What's up with
the fast stroll?

30:25.694 --> 30:28.318
- Can I holler?
- ( chuckles ) Hi.

30:28.318 --> 30:32.110
MAN:
The role played
by the African-Americans

30:32.110 --> 30:33.735
in the history
of this country

30:33.735 --> 30:36.360
has been largely
unnoticed.

30:36.360 --> 30:37.735
Of course, history is

30:37.735 --> 30:40.068
the record
of an account of the past.

30:40.068 --> 30:43.610
But the issue here is,
who is recording the account?

30:43.610 --> 30:47.402
If it's Snowflake,
Whitey, Paleface,

30:47.402 --> 30:49.068
Peckerwoods,
Cracker--

30:49.068 --> 30:52.151
we got Cleopatra
looking like Elizabeth Taylor.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.735
Jesus looks like
a hippie in a dashiki.

30:54.735 --> 30:56.902
But if it's one
of my proud black people

30:56.902 --> 30:58.652
that's doing the recording
of the account--

30:58.652 --> 30:59.819
Yo, Silas!

30:59.819 --> 31:02.527
We might have Moses
looking like

31:02.527 --> 31:05.110
this fine black man
right here.

31:05.110 --> 31:08.819
- ( professor continues )
- I'm sore as a motherfucker.

31:08.819 --> 31:11.068
Who invented
the air conditioner?

31:11.068 --> 31:12.568
A black man.

31:12.568 --> 31:13.944
What's up, dogs?

31:13.944 --> 31:17.235
Yo, son, I'm sore
as a bitch in heat.

31:17.235 --> 31:19.694
And you know what else?
I'm going to have

31:19.694 --> 31:21.735
to knock that Bart character
the fuck out.

31:21.735 --> 31:24.151
Once again,
a black man.

31:24.151 --> 31:26.318
Can't this wait
till after class?

31:26.318 --> 31:29.402
You supposed
to be in here, anyway.
This is  black history.

31:29.402 --> 31:32.610
Black history? It look like
all the black students

31:32.610 --> 31:34.610
that was in here
are  history.

31:34.610 --> 31:37.276
- Shh!
- Are you telling me
to "shh"?

31:37.276 --> 31:39.318
See what I mean?
Fuck history.

31:39.318 --> 31:42.568
- That's right.
Fuck history.
- Yeah, fuck history.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.068
Mr. Moses, I expect you'll be
ready for your quiz tomorrow?

31:45.068 --> 31:48.360
Quiz my ass.
A white man teaching
black history, anyway.

31:48.360 --> 31:52.902
That's some bullshit.
I'm going to lunch and take
a nice long shit.

31:52.902 --> 31:55.235
That's the kind of attitude
I like to hear.

31:55.235 --> 31:57.860
And where are you going?

31:57.860 --> 32:01.652
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.
Plymouth Rock landed on us.

32:01.652 --> 32:04.735
Ooh, all right!
Malcolm X!

32:04.735 --> 32:06.735
I'm glad someone's
appreciating the knowledge

32:06.735 --> 32:08.902
I'm trying
to drop on you today.

32:08.902 --> 32:10.902
Why don't you two walk out
in protest with your brothers?

32:10.902 --> 32:13.318
Walk out on me.
What are you doing
sitting there?

32:13.318 --> 32:16.735
You look like Whitey,
like a couple of goddamn
Uncle Toms.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.652
Walk on out!
That's right!

32:18.652 --> 32:20.652
Get up and move!
You should lynch me!

32:20.652 --> 32:23.151
Lynch me for what my people
have done to your people.

No, don't put him in--
oh, my baby!

33:43.276 --> 33:46.068
Can anyone tell me
the name of this plant?

33:46.068 --> 33:48.026
Bart?

33:48.026 --> 33:50.443
Yeah, it's a hanging
rubber plant.

33:50.443 --> 33:54.068
It's indigenous
to the wet drylands
of the northern hemisphere.

33:54.068 --> 33:56.777
Yeah right, Bart.
Would you bet money on that?

33:56.777 --> 33:59.402
Or is that like below
the Dooster principle?

33:59.402 --> 34:01.568
Yeah, I'll bet on it.
How 'bout an SUV?

34:01.568 --> 34:02.944
I got three of 'em.

34:02.944 --> 34:06.276
And the survey says,
ehhh, you lose.

34:06.276 --> 34:08.443
It's a neem plant,
Professor.

34:08.443 --> 34:10.068
Oui.
Yes.

34:10.068 --> 34:12.275
But how did
you know that, Silas?

34:12.275 --> 34:14.777
I had this nasty-ass
rash once.

34:14.777 --> 34:16.777
I put a little bit
of neem plant on it,

34:16.777 --> 34:18.443
it cleared it up in an hour.
I even smoked it before.

34:18.443 --> 34:20.819
That figures.

34:20.819 --> 34:22.610
One thing it doesn't
cure, though--

34:22.610 --> 34:24.402
being a spoiled
little bitch.

34:24.402 --> 34:27.944
PROFESSOR:
I'd like you all to do
an experiment on a plant.

34:27.944 --> 34:31.360
Something that...
may benefit mankind.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.235
And if you devise
something groundbreaking,

34:34.235 --> 34:37.944
I guarantee you
an "A" in this course.

34:37.944 --> 34:40.527
Okay, class dismissed.
Good work, everyone.

34:40.527 --> 34:42.694
- Thank you.
- Nice. Keep up
the good work.

34:42.694 --> 34:45.652
WOMAN:
So, he likes plants,
does he?

34:45.652 --> 34:47.527
I see still waters
run deep.

34:47.527 --> 34:51.485
Please believe.
But wait till you see
my presentation.

34:51.485 --> 34:52.902
You going to love me
after that.

34:52.902 --> 34:55.652
Lauren, you might
as well tell him now

34:55.652 --> 34:57.318
and get it
over with.

34:57.318 --> 34:59.151
- What?
- You know,

34:59.151 --> 35:01.860
how you're starting to see Bart
for the shallow bastard he is,

35:01.860 --> 35:04.318
and eventually you're going
to leave his ass for me.

35:04.318 --> 35:06.819
Holler.

35:12.402 --> 35:15.026
PROFESSOR:
This semester
in women's studies,

35:15.026 --> 35:18.110
we will discuss how women are
objectified in popular culture

35:18.110 --> 35:19.860
while the masculine bastards

35:19.860 --> 35:22.568
exploit women's ideas
for great profit,

35:22.568 --> 35:24.360
then take all the credit.

35:24.360 --> 35:27.360

35:27.360 --> 35:29.819

grabby-ass again, huh?

35:48.235 --> 35:51.652
- Ma?
- Did you wash
your ass today?

35:51.652 --> 35:54.402
Ah! Ah! Damn, Ma!
Stop, Ma! Stop!

36:00.568 --> 36:03.902
- SILAS: You high yet?
- JAMAL: I don't know.
Maybe not high enough.

36:03.902 --> 36:06.402
- Where the hell is he?
- ( coughs )

36:07.193 --> 36:09.402
Maybe I ain't hit it
hard enough.

36:09.402 --> 36:12.068
What are you doing?
Dropping your kids off
at the pool?

36:14.026 --> 36:15.944
Oh, shit.

36:15.944 --> 36:18.402
( chuckling )
What's up, J?
Give me five.

36:18.402 --> 36:20.068
I hate it
when you do that.

36:20.068 --> 36:21.735
I love doing that.
That shit is funny.

36:21.735 --> 36:23.443
What took you so long?

36:23.443 --> 36:26.235
Biggie and Pac, man.
They throwing a party.

36:26.235 --> 36:27.944
Open bar all night!

36:27.944 --> 36:32.318
Everything was cool
till Marvin Gaye came
in there tripping.

36:32.318 --> 36:34.652
- Marvin Gaye?
- Yeah.

36:34.652 --> 36:38.026
- We got a test
in about five minutes.
- Word.

36:38.026 --> 36:40.276
What that got to do with me?
I know you ready.

36:40.276 --> 36:42.985
- I know you studied for it.
- Ready? We ain't studied--

36:42.985 --> 36:46.443
- Come on.
- You got a golden opportunity
to make something of yourself.

36:46.443 --> 36:49.527
And you just throwing it away?
It's time for you to learn
a lesson.

36:49.527 --> 36:51.652
- Come on, Ive.
- I'm out, man.

36:51.652 --> 36:53.777
Ive! Don't play! Ive!

36:53.777 --> 36:57.235
- Talk to your boy.
- Why'd you tell him
we ain't studied?

36:57.235 --> 36:59.944
- Damn all that!
- You should've thought
of that before you--

36:59.944 --> 37:04.235
Whassup?!
I'm just fucking
with you, man.

37:04.235 --> 37:06.860
- This is bullshit.
- This is some good shit, man.

37:06.860 --> 37:08.985
You know you my boy.

37:08.985 --> 37:11.944
"C," Silas.
Come on, man.
The Portugese.

37:11.944 --> 37:14.652
1863. That's "B."

37:14.652 --> 37:17.026
J, what are you doing?
1961.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.819
- "B?"
- Trust me on this,
I got all the answers.

37:19.819 --> 37:21.819
You just told me
that goddamn answer.

37:21.819 --> 37:24.110
"A." French.
That be the French.

37:24.110 --> 37:27.652

At least you all
being entertained.

37:40.485 --> 37:43.860
I ain't seen a stitch of pussy
on this whole campus.

37:43.860 --> 37:47.985
The chickens are not
clucking around here.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.860
You've come
to the right place.

37:51.860 --> 37:54.193
I've been an undergrad
for 12 years.

37:54.193 --> 37:57.819
I know everything there is
to know about Ivy League women.

37:57.819 --> 37:59.360
SILAS:
12 years?

37:59.360 --> 38:02.276
Damn, kid.
Your people paying
for all this shit?

38:02.276 --> 38:04.151
A drop in the bucket, sucka.

38:04.151 --> 38:06.735
I remain here
solely for the purpose

38:06.735 --> 38:09.527

with Harvard women.

to explore STDs also, my friend.

dropped the charges.

to pardon my dust.

41:59.402 --> 42:01.568
- Looks old.
- It is old.

42:01.568 --> 42:03.485
It's over 200 years old.

42:03.485 --> 42:06.110
I, um, sort of
discovered it.

42:06.110 --> 42:08.485
You discovered
all this crazy shit.

42:08.485 --> 42:10.443
You're a straight up
genius, girl.

42:12.902 --> 42:14.944
Well, I don't know
about all that.

42:14.944 --> 42:17.318
Um... I do know
it's Ben Franklin's.

42:17.318 --> 42:18.860
I just don't know
what it is.

42:18.860 --> 42:20.860
But I was thinking
that it could be

42:20.860 --> 42:23.610
like this old
revolutionary cannon.

42:23.610 --> 42:25.819
Or a telescope.
Or um...

42:25.819 --> 42:29.110
Whatever it is,
this shit is hot.

42:29.110 --> 42:30.694
Let me ask you
something.

42:30.694 --> 42:32.568
Yeah.

42:32.568 --> 42:35.235
How'd you hook up
with that Bart dude?

42:35.235 --> 42:37.819

all my life.

42:37.819 --> 42:40.443

for his family,

42:40.443 --> 42:42.151
I probably wouldn't
be here.

42:42.151 --> 42:44.944
Well, isn't that
sweet.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.443
( chattering )

42:52.318 --> 42:54.402
- Ah-ha!
- ( gasps )

42:54.402 --> 42:56.485
Bart, honey.
Sweetie.

42:56.485 --> 42:57.944
You are
just in time

42:57.944 --> 43:00.652
because I've just
finished studying.

43:00.652 --> 43:02.652
- Studying?
- Yeah.

43:02.652 --> 43:04.652
I didn't know the two of you
were studying in here...

43:04.652 --> 43:06.318
alone...

43:06.318 --> 43:07.944
with the lights dim...

43:07.944 --> 43:10.276
drinking beer?!

43:10.276 --> 43:12.944
Look Silas,
I know what you're
trying to do, okay?

43:12.944 --> 43:14.318
You're trying
to frick her.

43:16.485 --> 43:18.860
Whatever, Bartkowski.
Um, listen,

43:18.860 --> 43:22.443
I was just admiring
your girl's thing.

43:23.819 --> 43:26.276
Well, I guess
I should say thanks.

43:26.276 --> 43:27.819
This is a part
of history, man.

43:27.819 --> 43:29.318
Your girl is doing
something I think

43:29.318 --> 43:32.402
- you need to recognize.
- Yeah. So?

43:32.402 --> 43:34.068
Listen, I'm out.

43:34.068 --> 43:37.193
Maybe next time
I'll get to study
with you.

43:37.193 --> 43:40.276
- Peace.
- Peace is meant to explain
a state of tranquility.

43:40.276 --> 43:42.777
Okay? So, why don't
you try thinking
of another way

43:42.777 --> 43:45.610
to say goodbye now
that you're amongst
civilized people.

43:45.610 --> 43:47.360
Well, Mr. Civilized,

43:47.360 --> 43:49.944
peace can also be used
interjectionally

43:49.944 --> 43:53.026
as a request, greeting,
or farewell.

43:53.026 --> 43:55.819
So, try to find another way
to be an asshole

43:55.819 --> 43:58.193
if you don't know
your grammar, that is.

43:58.193 --> 43:59.694
Peace.

44:02.193 --> 44:04.527
Okay, Bart!

44:04.527 --> 44:06.694
God, can I get my stuff?

44:07.735 --> 44:09.527
Sheesh.

44:10.527 --> 44:12.694
( disguised voice )
Yes.

44:12.694 --> 44:15.068
It was near
the medical library.

44:15.068 --> 44:17.068
I think they said
it was one of those,

44:17.068 --> 44:20.735
tick-tocky, blow-upy,
exploding thing-- thingy,

44:20.735 --> 44:22.276
pipebomb thing--
things.

44:22.276 --> 44:24.443
Yeah. Yeah.

44:24.443 --> 44:27.110
Thank you.
You, too.

44:27.110 --> 44:29.068
All righty. Bye.

44:31.026 --> 44:33.402
( police siren blaring )

44:35.694 --> 44:38.568
Dooster principle,
my ass.

44:39.318 --> 44:41.402
Mm-hmm.

44:44.485 --> 44:47.402
JAMAL:
Man, my grandmother loved
this shit in her garden.

44:52.902 --> 44:54.902
Lasso, boys.

44:58.151 --> 45:00.110
Yee-hah!

45:02.819 --> 45:04.944
Timber!

45:07.110 --> 45:08.860
That statue
is priceless.

45:08.860 --> 45:10.610
It means everything
to our family.

45:10.610 --> 45:12.777
Will you stop your damn
sniveling, son?

45:12.777 --> 45:14.443
Buck up, Bart.

45:14.443 --> 45:16.110
Buck up!

45:16.110 --> 45:18.360
Yo, do you think
they gonna find out

45:18.360 --> 45:19.610
we stole
the Dooster statue?

45:19.610 --> 45:21.402
SILAS:
Hell, no.

45:21.402 --> 45:23.318
Oh, my God!
I knew it.

45:23.318 --> 45:24.902
You guys stole
the Dooster.

45:24.902 --> 45:26.276
They do what?

45:26.276 --> 45:27.819
Fellas, I think
it's time

45:27.819 --> 45:29.276
we all sat down
and kicked it.

45:29.276 --> 45:30.777
No, no.
I'm not kicking
anything.

45:30.777 --> 45:32.402
I have a pledge meeting
to go to,

45:32.402 --> 45:34.276
and I still haven't
greased myself up.

45:34.276 --> 45:36.443
God, I just don't
get you guys.

45:36.443 --> 45:38.068
There's a lot
of things in life

45:38.068 --> 45:39.985
your ass
just don't get.

45:39.985 --> 45:42.819
Yeah, like pussy
and respect.

45:44.276 --> 45:46.151
I heard that.

45:50.193 --> 45:52.151
See, the system is geared

45:52.151 --> 45:55.402
to put most of the wealth
into the hands of a few.

45:55.402 --> 45:57.985
The rich weapons,
poor schoolin'.

45:57.985 --> 46:00.026
Yeah, for sure, nigger.

46:00.026 --> 46:02.610
- Yeah, for sure.
- Y'all don't know shit.

46:02.610 --> 46:04.026
I'm a' learned you,
though.

46:04.026 --> 46:05.443
I'm a' learned ya.

46:07.026 --> 46:09.610
Dwarves, midgets,

46:09.610 --> 46:11.235
motherfuckin' unicorns--

46:11.235 --> 46:13.026
them motherfuckers
don't want to see

46:13.026 --> 46:14.443
a black man make it.

46:14.443 --> 46:16.235
- Yeah.
- You know
what I mean?

46:16.235 --> 46:18.235
- For sure.
- You know?

46:18.235 --> 46:20.485
And I'll tell you
something else.

46:30.402 --> 46:32.360
For sure.

46:39.527 --> 46:41.110
Word up,
young MC.

46:41.110 --> 46:43.026
You're just in time
to help cheer us
to victory.

46:43.026 --> 46:44.485
Young MC.

46:44.485 --> 46:47.193
Bart, you know,
I think you keep getting
funnier every day.

46:47.193 --> 46:49.235
You ain't gonna be laughing
in a minute.

46:49.235 --> 46:50.610
Jamal.

46:50.610 --> 46:53.026
Bart, I've decided
since you and Jamal

46:53.026 --> 46:54.568
are my two best athletes,

46:54.568 --> 46:57.068
I want you up against Yale.

46:57.068 --> 46:59.026
You can't just change
the line-up!

46:59.026 --> 47:01.026
- That's against the rules!
- What rules? Who cares?

47:01.026 --> 47:02.777
Do you guys care
about the rules?!

47:02.777 --> 47:04.652
- No.
- There you go.

47:04.652 --> 47:06.735
( cheering )

47:08.735 --> 47:10.068
ANNOUNCER:
On your mark,

47:10.068 --> 47:12.068
get set...

47:12.068 --> 47:15.402
and they're off.
It's a clean start.

47:17.068 --> 47:19.985
What are you doing,
hip-hop hooray? Paddle!

47:19.985 --> 47:21.276
Paddle like a man!

47:21.276 --> 47:23.860
Shoot the J.
Get jiggy with it.
Something!

47:23.860 --> 47:26.944
ANNOUNCER:
They're blowing Harvard's ass
out of the water.

47:26.944 --> 47:30.360
Jamal, what's your ass doing
rowing a boat?

47:30.360 --> 47:32.151
You're supposed to be
in class.

47:32.151 --> 47:33.652
Who the hell is that woman
in the sky?!

47:33.652 --> 47:35.485
- I don't know.
- What's the matter?

47:35.485 --> 47:38.276
You been smoking
too much ganja, huh?

47:38.276 --> 47:39.819
BART:
She's huge!

47:39.819 --> 47:41.735
I guess you might
as well come back home

47:41.735 --> 47:42.985
and live with me.

47:42.985 --> 47:44.110
Oh hell, no!

47:44.110 --> 47:47.110
- Did you cuss at me?
- Row, motherfucker! Row!

47:49.360 --> 47:50.694
Yes, Dean Cain.

47:50.694 --> 47:52.443
Am I to believe
this is correct?

47:52.443 --> 47:55.402
Jamal and Silas
have gotten all A's?

48:02.110 --> 48:04.193
I'll call you back.

48:04.193 --> 48:05.652
COACH:
How you doing, Dean?

48:05.652 --> 48:07.944
How you doing?
How you been?

48:09.193 --> 48:11.026
I see you checking out
my gear, right?

48:11.026 --> 48:13.110
- It's pretty tight, right?
- No, actually,

48:13.110 --> 48:14.902
- it's rather baggy.
- No, no, man.

48:14.902 --> 48:16.652
It's phat, it's dope,
it's cool, it's bufu.

48:16.652 --> 48:18.944
Bill, what has happened
to you?

48:18.944 --> 48:20.735
Sit down and take off
those glasses.

48:20.735 --> 48:21.902
All righty.

48:23.735 --> 48:25.485
Tell me,
how's Jamal doing?

48:25.485 --> 48:28.110
Fine. Very well.
He's coming along.

48:28.110 --> 48:31.151
Now listen,
Jaime's father is having
an upcoming election.

48:31.151 --> 48:34.318
And it won't look good
if she was to be involved

48:34.318 --> 48:35.985
with someone
from the lower class.

48:35.985 --> 48:37.652
Isn't Jaime a freshman?

48:38.652 --> 48:40.318
All right,
so you want me

48:40.318 --> 48:41.819
to tell Jamal
to stop seeing Jaime.

48:41.819 --> 48:43.652
He'll just tell me,
"Hey, man--

48:43.652 --> 48:46.527
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you.

48:46.527 --> 48:48.110
Point well taken.

48:48.110 --> 48:50.610
I need you to help me
get proof

48:50.610 --> 48:53.151
that Jamal
is diddling Jaime.

48:53.151 --> 48:55.235
Oh, I see now.

48:55.235 --> 48:57.151
Yes, it's all good.

48:57.151 --> 48:59.652
Yeah, I'll go holler
at him, son.

49:00.902 --> 49:02.610
Bill, Bill.

49:02.610 --> 49:04.694
Did you
just call me son?

49:04.694 --> 49:06.819
Word.

49:07.777 --> 49:10.068
Word?

49:10.068 --> 49:12.527
Stroke, smoke,

49:12.527 --> 49:14.360
stroke, smoke,

49:14.360 --> 49:16.694
stroke, smoke,

49:16.694 --> 49:19.360
stroke, smoke,

49:19.360 --> 49:21.944
stroke, smoke--

49:21.944 --> 49:24.985
If Dean Cain think he can
kick me out the school
that easy,

49:24.985 --> 49:26.902
he got another
thing coming.

49:26.902 --> 49:29.485
- What an asshole.
- Hey, Coach, thanks a lot.

49:29.485 --> 49:30.527
I owe you.

49:30.527 --> 49:32.860
- Ooh.
- Listen, Jaime,

49:32.860 --> 49:36.360
me and you cannot
see each other no more.

49:36.360 --> 49:38.610
No more dating,
no more fooling around.

49:38.610 --> 49:40.610
None of that!
It stops. That's it.

49:40.610 --> 49:42.777
Yes, it's probably better

49:42.777 --> 49:44.694
if we stop seeing each other

49:44.694 --> 49:47.694
for the sake
of my father's campaign.

49:47.694 --> 49:50.360
If he lost the election
and it was my fault,

49:50.360 --> 49:52.652
gosh-golly,

49:52.652 --> 49:55.568
that would be
so hard on me.

49:56.735 --> 49:58.819
I don't think
I could live
with myself.

49:58.819 --> 50:00.860
But baby,
maybe it'd be better

50:00.860 --> 50:03.068
if you went to school
somewhere down south.

50:06.068 --> 50:08.193
JAMAL:
I think you should
go down south first.

50:08.193 --> 50:10.360
This guy's a real asshole.

50:11.360 --> 50:12.652
JEFF:
I can't.

50:12.652 --> 50:14.276
I can't do it,
all right?

50:14.276 --> 50:16.360
If you don't bring
your ass on--

50:16.360 --> 50:19.026
We got work to do
before Dean Dickhead
gets back.

50:19.026 --> 50:21.068
Come on.

50:35.151 --> 50:37.443
Aren't you worried
about getting kicked out?

50:37.443 --> 50:40.110
For this?
He ain't never gonna
find out. Relax.

50:45.193 --> 50:47.110
( bird-call )

50:51.527 --> 50:54.235
What happen to bird?
Crazy shitting everywhere?

50:54.235 --> 50:55.652
Crazy shit, all right.

50:55.652 --> 50:57.777
And it will be everywhere.

50:58.777 --> 51:00.694
With that
they just won't shit.

51:00.694 --> 51:03.443
- Yeah.
- They're gonna blow up.

51:04.944 --> 51:06.902
( yelling, laughing )

51:32.443 --> 51:35.193
And as for you two,

51:35.193 --> 51:37.819
ever since you arrived
on this campus,

51:37.819 --> 51:39.652
there's been several mishaps.

51:39.652 --> 51:41.652
Now, my instincts
tell me it's you,

51:41.652 --> 51:44.110
but I can't prove it.
Not yet.

51:44.110 --> 51:46.527
But I know
if I give you enough time,

51:46.527 --> 51:48.944
pretty soon you're going
to slip up.

51:48.944 --> 51:50.860
And then I'll be able
to send you back

51:50.860 --> 51:53.652
to your miserable
existence.

51:59.777 --> 52:01.944
What the hell
are you wearing?

52:01.944 --> 52:03.318
Bufu!

52:03.318 --> 52:05.110
Bufu?

52:05.110 --> 52:07.360
By us, fuck you.

52:08.235 --> 52:10.527
Get out!
Out, out, out...

52:11.902 --> 52:14.276
By us, fuck you.

52:14.276 --> 52:16.777
JAMAL:
If the chancellor's
throwing a Halloween party,

52:16.777 --> 52:18.985
wait till Harvard
see our Halloween party.

52:18.985 --> 52:21.610
SILAS:
Yeah, but if Dean Cain
find out about this shit,

52:21.610 --> 52:24.235
he gonna be mad
as a motherfucker.

52:24.235 --> 52:25.819
What the fuck
is he gonna do?

52:25.819 --> 52:28.026
We got the Ivory,
getting straight A's.

52:28.026 --> 52:31.527
We got this
motherfucker locked!

52:33.318 --> 52:35.443
They look like
they got money.

52:35.443 --> 52:36.735
They kinda cute.

52:36.735 --> 52:39.902
Girl, we gonna
get paid.

52:41.193 --> 52:44.068
- How you doing?
- For real.

52:45.819 --> 52:48.568
- End-table ass!
- Hella back.

52:48.568 --> 52:51.151
Where the party at?
We trying to get a party on
and stuff.

52:51.151 --> 52:52.860
We having a party.

52:52.860 --> 52:55.402
Costume party
at the Lovell house.

52:55.402 --> 52:57.402
- Ooh.

52:57.402 --> 53:00.402
Please, bring your ass
and titties along with ya.

53:00.402 --> 53:02.360
We want all the hos
out here to come.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.652
Wait a minute.
Did you just call us hos?

53:04.652 --> 53:06.568
I meant that
in a good way.

53:06.568 --> 53:08.568
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

53:08.568 --> 53:10.735
Here. Now, bring all

53:10.735 --> 53:12.735
There you go.

53:12.735 --> 53:14.735
Y'all gonna pay us, right?

53:16.902 --> 53:18.151
I don't hear nothing.

53:18.151 --> 53:19.652
Yo, we got dough.
Talk to 'em.

53:19.652 --> 53:21.318
Yeah, yeah.
We got dough.

53:21.318 --> 53:22.944
If not, our best friends

53:22.944 --> 53:24.568
And if not,

53:24.568 --> 53:26.568
Okay, yeah.

53:29.527 --> 53:31.276
Ballers, girl!

53:31.276 --> 53:33.110
- Okay, all right.
- Ballers, all right.

53:36.944 --> 53:39.151
BOTH:
Whoo.

53:39.151 --> 53:41.735
Popcorn player.

53:44.276 --> 53:47.360
SILAS:
I got one more
delivery to make.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.568
Guess who used
to be black?

53:51.777 --> 53:54.193
Oh, Dean Cain.
But he is black.

53:54.193 --> 53:55.777
Like a polar bear.

53:55.777 --> 53:57.485
But I got a recipe
that'll inject

53:57.485 --> 54:00.402
some ghetto back
in his ass.

54:00.402 --> 54:02.652
Got some more beer.

54:02.652 --> 54:04.485
What did you do
to yourself?

54:05.694 --> 54:07.235
Oh, oh.
The fox club.

54:07.235 --> 54:08.735
They put me
in a shopping cart

54:08.735 --> 54:10.485
and shoved me down
a hill.

54:10.485 --> 54:12.819
Thank God I fell out
before I hit the freeway.

54:12.819 --> 54:14.985
What the fuck are you doing?
Put the milk back.

54:14.985 --> 54:17.068
You're not supposed
to steal from us!

54:17.068 --> 54:19.568
Why are you always
taking violent tones
with people?

54:19.568 --> 54:21.652
Man, shut up before
I kick your ass!

54:21.652 --> 54:23.151
You know,
as human beings

54:23.151 --> 54:24.485
we should be able
to talk this out,

54:24.485 --> 54:26.110
not resort
to violence.

54:26.110 --> 54:28.151
How you gonna talk
when you shutting up?

54:28.151 --> 54:30.068
- Fine!  Fine!
You want some violence?!
- ( glass shatters )

54:30.068 --> 54:31.819
You want a piece of this?
Come on!

54:31.819 --> 54:33.944
I'll show you some violence!
Well, come on!

54:34.819 --> 54:37.318
Ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow!

54:37.318 --> 54:39.110
Oh, God!

54:39.985 --> 54:41.860
Now, go to time-out.

54:42.902 --> 54:44.151
Go to your room.

54:50.485 --> 54:53.068
( doorbell rings )

54:53.068 --> 54:55.985
I wonder
who this could be.

54:55.985 --> 54:57.902
Oh, my goodness.

54:57.902 --> 54:59.527
Honey, look at this.

54:59.527 --> 55:01.360
I wonder who these
are from?

55:03.193 --> 55:06.318
"Dear Carl,
saw these and thought of you.

55:06.318 --> 55:08.318
Love, Mrs. Ray."

55:08.318 --> 55:10.485
It's my old school mum!

55:10.485 --> 55:13.026
I haven't heard
from her in years.

55:13.026 --> 55:14.694
Oh, how sweet.

55:14.694 --> 55:17.026
She knows
I love brownies.

55:18.735 --> 55:21.777
Mmm.
A little piece
of heaven.

55:21.777 --> 55:23.110
Better than mine?

55:23.110 --> 55:25.360
Darling, I don't remember
you cooking brownies.

55:25.360 --> 55:26.902
You're right.
I don't.

55:26.902 --> 55:28.777
Hurry up, you're going
to make us late.

55:28.777 --> 55:30.568
You know how I hate
to be late.

55:30.568 --> 55:31.902
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- All right.

55:31.902 --> 55:33.735
I'll take these upstairs.

55:35.235 --> 55:36.485
I'll have another.

55:36.485 --> 55:37.819
They're great.

55:37.819 --> 55:40.568
Throw me a beer,
you big weenie!

55:44.902 --> 55:46.735
Whoo!

55:50.402 --> 55:52.068
Lovell house!

55:52.068 --> 55:53.568
( loud burp )

55:56.652 --> 55:58.819
Cypress Hill.
What up, fellas?

55:58.819 --> 56:00.193
What's up, man?

56:00.193 --> 56:02.402
- How was the trip?
- Good. Good.

56:02.402 --> 56:04.110
I see Muggs
couldn't make it,

56:04.110 --> 56:05.652
so I brought my man,
I need money.

56:05.652 --> 56:07.527
- Is he any good?
- Yeah, he don't talk.

56:07.527 --> 56:09.068
He speak with his hands.
Know what I mean?

56:09.068 --> 56:11.985
- Right, right, right.
- You have a good show.

56:11.985 --> 56:13.819
- ( record scratches )
- Hey, hey.

56:13.819 --> 56:16.402
Don't fuck up tonight,
all right?

56:20.735 --> 56:22.944
Hey, what the fuck
is the plate for, man?

56:27.527 --> 56:29.735
It's gonna be a long night.

56:31.944 --> 56:33.360
- Carl.
- Philip.

56:33.360 --> 56:35.151
- How are you?
- Wonderful.

56:35.151 --> 56:37.568
You know Miss Janowitz
from the chemistry department.

56:37.568 --> 56:39.610
And Miss Lovell
from administration.

56:39.610 --> 56:42.193
- You know my wife, Sheila.
- Almost didn't recognize you.

56:42.193 --> 56:44.819
I thought you brought
a professional model
to the party.

56:44.819 --> 56:47.568
- You look lovely.
- Oh, Philip.

56:47.568 --> 56:49.276
Yeah, the bitch is fine,
ain't she?

56:49.276 --> 56:50.610
What?

56:50.610 --> 56:52.735
Dear, can you at least
feign some interest?

56:52.735 --> 56:54.151
You're embarrassing me.

56:54.151 --> 56:56.944
And will you loosen up?
You're so stiff sometimes.

56:56.944 --> 56:58.402
Stiff?

56:58.402 --> 57:01.318
This party is stiff.

57:01.318 --> 57:03.318
Excuse me,
can you hold this?
I'm hot.

57:03.318 --> 57:05.151
Can you put this
back on, actually?

57:05.151 --> 57:06.985
Your-- your butt
is sticking out.

57:08.193 --> 57:09.985
What?

57:10.902 --> 57:12.944
What a jerk!

57:14.652 --> 57:16.902
PHILIP:
Don't spoil your appetite.
We're about to have

57:16.902 --> 57:18.985
some lobster bisque
and Indian pudding.

57:18.985 --> 57:21.235
I got the munchies
like a motherfucker.

57:21.235 --> 57:23.235
Hold this, baby.

57:23.235 --> 57:25.068
He seems unusual tonight.

57:25.068 --> 57:27.026
He's dehydrated.

57:30.026 --> 57:32.026
- Dance.
- ( groans )

57:33.402 --> 57:35.026
Yo, baby,
this is boring as hell!

57:35.026 --> 57:36.902
Yo, yo, yo, DJ?!

57:36.902 --> 57:39.985
Hit me!

57:39.985 --> 57:42.026
( hip-hop playing )

57:47.443 --> 57:49.026
Come here, girl!

57:51.193 --> 57:53.527
Go, Dean!

58:09.902 --> 58:11.902
See, I told you
I have you covered.

58:11.902 --> 58:15.068
There go the two big ballers
right there.

58:17.068 --> 58:19.527
- You two stay put.
- I'm going to hurt you.

58:20.902 --> 58:23.026
Hey, hey, hey...

58:24.235 --> 58:26.193
Yo, J, yo, T.

58:26.193 --> 58:29.151
See those two fine-ass
hos right there?

58:29.151 --> 58:31.485
Don't you wish
they were really hos?

58:31.485 --> 58:32.985
And they came over here
and said,

58:32.985 --> 58:35.568
"We want to run
a dick-sucking marathon

58:35.568 --> 58:37.068
with y'all two."

58:37.068 --> 58:39.485
- Oh, yeah.
I'd like that.
- Me, too.

58:39.485 --> 58:41.944
Okay, you and you.

58:41.944 --> 58:45.068
We want to run a dick-sucking
marathon with y'all.

58:46.402 --> 58:48.235
TUAN:
Okay.

58:48.235 --> 58:49.985
I'm not that good at it.

58:49.985 --> 58:51.652
Oh, baby, I ain't laughing.

58:51.652 --> 58:53.944
I'm gonna make you mine.

58:53.944 --> 58:55.777
Smells good.

58:55.777 --> 58:57.735
Pretty boy lookin'
motherfucker.

58:58.610 --> 59:00.527
Hey, don't be scared.

59:00.527 --> 59:02.276
It's only pussy.

59:03.443 --> 59:05.402
Don't be scared.

59:05.402 --> 59:08.068
I got two inches
of hard dick.

59:09.276 --> 59:11.735
I'll work with you, baby.
Come on.

59:16.652 --> 59:18.318
POWDER:
Costume party.

59:18.318 --> 59:20.944
Place, Lovell house.
Time, Friday.

59:20.944 --> 59:23.610
- It is Friday.
- That's what she told
Cocoa Butter.

59:23.610 --> 59:25.694
These bitches better be
getting my money.

59:25.694 --> 59:28.110
Hella back is
my bottom bitch.
You know that, right?

59:28.110 --> 59:29.860
- Right, right.
- Okay.

59:29.860 --> 59:31.652
The bitch better be
out here checkin' my money.

59:31.652 --> 59:33.819
Please don't cuss.
You know when I'm trying

59:33.819 --> 59:35.944
to listen to the word.
The Lord don't like that.

59:35.944 --> 59:38.193
- What did I say?
- You said, "bitch."

59:38.193 --> 59:40.402
and "bitch" ain't
in the Bible.

59:40.402 --> 59:42.276
I know, bitch!
And neither is motherfucker!

59:42.276 --> 59:44.318
So drive
this motherfuckin' car!

59:44.318 --> 59:46.485
And you the assistant pimp.

59:46.485 --> 59:48.193
You ain't even
a real pimp.

59:48.193 --> 59:50.610
You're supposed to co-signing
to the shit that I say.

59:50.610 --> 59:52.985
You want to lose your job?
I'm gonna pull your application.

59:52.985 --> 59:55.026
Now let's practice it.
Where's my bitches?

59:55.026 --> 59:57.235
- Where's my bitches?
- Where's my bitches?

59:57.235 --> 59:59.652
You got to say it together.
It goes in together.

59:59.652 --> 01:00:01.527
- Where my bitches?
- Where my bitches?

01:00:01.527 --> 01:00:03.026
Okay, check this out.
Where my bitches?

01:00:03.026 --> 01:00:05.443
Where my--
can't we just say
employees?

01:00:05.443 --> 01:00:08.110

No, fuck that.

I must be buzzed,
I'm babbling.

01:01:57.610 --> 01:02:00.610
You know,
you surprised me
by getting high.

01:02:01.568 --> 01:02:03.485
I'm not that much
of a square, Silas.

01:02:03.485 --> 01:02:05.902
I did do it once
in high school.

01:02:08.527 --> 01:02:10.276
What about you?

01:02:10.276 --> 01:02:11.944
We all have secrets.

01:02:11.944 --> 01:02:13.610
Well, if you act right,

01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:16.026
I might just let you
in my head one day.

01:02:16.026 --> 01:02:17.443
Whatever.

01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:20.151
But I ain't saying shit
on the first date.

01:02:20.151 --> 01:02:22.527
Who said this was a date?

01:02:22.527 --> 01:02:24.318
You smoked my weed,
didn't you?

01:02:24.318 --> 01:02:26.318
And we almost kissed,
didn't we?

01:02:26.318 --> 01:02:28.235
- We did not.
- Yes, we did.

01:02:28.235 --> 01:02:29.985
- We did not.
- Here, hit this.

01:02:36.402 --> 01:02:39.652
Oh, my bad.
Did I spoil the moment?

01:02:39.652 --> 01:02:42.485
I can't help it, though.
Them shits was talking to me.

01:02:42.485 --> 01:02:44.068
You know what?

01:02:44.068 --> 01:02:46.276
Look at them things.
Turn the headlights off.

01:02:46.276 --> 01:02:48.819
I'm gonna tell you something.
This pimpin' that I got
in my blood,

01:02:48.819 --> 01:02:50.318
it came from a family trait.

01:02:50.318 --> 01:02:52.235
My grandaddy was a pimp.

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:54.652
My great-great-great
grandaddy was a pimp.

01:02:54.652 --> 01:02:56.819
I'm talking about pimpin'
been since pimpin'

01:02:56.819 --> 01:02:57.902
since been pimpin'.

01:02:57.902 --> 01:03:00.235
- It's in your bloodline.
- It's in my blood.

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:02.860
- And you will never be that.
- Wh-- what?

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:05.151
Because you was born,
all the people

01:03:05.151 --> 01:03:07.068
in your family
were assistant pimps.

01:03:07.068 --> 01:03:09.694
Assistant pimp?
I never did tell you that.

01:03:09.694 --> 01:03:11.819
I thought you was the one
the Lord chose.

01:03:11.819 --> 01:03:13.485
If it had not been
for the Lord,

01:03:13.485 --> 01:03:15.068
I wouldn't have not

01:03:15.068 --> 01:03:16.944
had a bitch come
into my life.

01:03:16.944 --> 01:03:18.777
- Not now, never?
- Not a now, notha bitch.

01:03:18.777 --> 01:03:21.402
Nobody say that now,
nothing like you say
that now notha.

01:03:21.402 --> 01:03:22.902
Not a now, notha bitch.

01:03:22.902 --> 01:03:24.819
And I still don't know
what that shit means,

01:03:24.819 --> 01:03:26.276
but it sound good.

01:03:26.276 --> 01:03:27.694
Now notha means,

01:03:27.694 --> 01:03:30.026
"don't get a now nothin'."

01:03:30.026 --> 01:03:32.527
- A now nothin'.
- Nothin' outta them.

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:35.360
Man, shut the fuck up
and drive this mother--

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.068

Hey, little bitty bitch.

01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:56.527

We already got pussy here.
Y'all come back later.

01:07:08.235 --> 01:07:10.068
I'm about to knock you

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:12.610

You smelly little mother--

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.443
Plus, there's no room

01:07:37.735 --> 01:07:39.276
I'll be back

- Yeah, both of us.

01:08:07.527 --> 01:08:10.568
Molly and I are

01:08:12.652 --> 01:08:14.360
Hell, no!
We ain't got no Diang--

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.860
And let me
let you know something!

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.984
While in this car,
you don't run shit!

01:08:17.984 --> 01:08:20.276

01:08:20.276 --> 01:08:21.609
Not pussy!

You think it's funny, bitch?!
This is pimpin' here.

- Oh, boy.

01:08:30.777 --> 01:08:32.734
Y'all rather piss off
barracuda than piss off Powder.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:34.652
Oh, it's funny.
Keep on laughing.

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:36.359

01:08:37.777 --> 01:08:39.652

01:08:41.694 --> 01:08:43.026
Wow.

Man, come on.
You act like I took it.

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:50.694
- We'll just get some more.
- Ain't no more.

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:52.984
All of Ivory's ashes
was in just that plant.

01:08:52.984 --> 01:08:54.652
Now, come on,
let's go see

01:08:54.652 --> 01:08:56.902
what this Dean
Stick-Up-His-Ass wants.

01:08:56.902 --> 01:08:59.193
He probably gonna
curse us out about
that wild-ass party.

01:08:59.193 --> 01:09:01.819
Man, that party
was not that wild.

01:09:04.443 --> 01:09:07.109
Yeah, it did get
a little out of hand.

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:08.652
Know what I'm saying?

01:09:08.652 --> 01:09:10.527
Sex novelties, obscenity,

01:09:10.527 --> 01:09:13.568
fighting, indecent exposure,

01:09:13.568 --> 01:09:16.568
rock bands without a permit.

01:09:17.734 --> 01:09:20.902
Welcome, gentlemen,
to academic probation.

01:09:22.234 --> 01:09:24.318
Damn, who gonna be
our O.O.?

01:09:24.318 --> 01:09:26.527
How charmingly ghetto.

01:09:27.527 --> 01:09:29.068
You're dismissed.

01:09:34.151 --> 01:09:36.068
We ain't got no Ivory,

01:09:36.068 --> 01:09:39.359
we're about to get kicked
the fuck out of here,

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:41.402
and what the fuck
are you doing?

01:09:41.402 --> 01:09:43.484
I'm working on
my truth serum.

01:09:43.484 --> 01:09:45.902
Why you got to sound
all belligerent
about my shit?

01:09:45.902 --> 01:09:48.234
- "Belligerent"?
- Yeah, belligerent.

01:09:48.234 --> 01:09:50.234
As in abusive
or truculent.

01:09:52.402 --> 01:09:54.902
You keep on using them
big-ass Harvard words

01:09:54.902 --> 01:09:57.568
and your ghetto pass
is gonna get revoked.

01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:59.985
Why don't you go
pick up a book
or something?

01:09:59.985 --> 01:10:01.443
If I get this shit right,

01:10:01.443 --> 01:10:02.902
I'll get an "A"
in botany class.

01:10:02.902 --> 01:10:06.652
- Ah, motherfucker.
- When I was 12,

01:10:06.652 --> 01:10:09.777
I used to love watching
my dogs hump.

01:10:09.777 --> 01:10:13.443
We used to have
a good time.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:16.985
( gurgling )

01:10:16.985 --> 01:10:18.610

01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:23.694
Aaah!

01:10:23.694 --> 01:10:26.944
- What the fuck is that?
- ( burps )

01:10:26.944 --> 01:10:29.068
I'm going to have
to tweak this shit a little.

01:10:29.068 --> 01:10:31.402
Me hungry.

01:10:31.402 --> 01:10:35.318
I say we burn them books,
go to that graveyard,

01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:38.235

01:10:38.235 --> 01:10:40.318
and smoke

01:10:40.318 --> 01:10:42.151
We sit down, blaze up,

01:10:42.151 --> 01:10:44.485
hit the books
for a few hours a day,

01:10:44.485 --> 01:10:46.527

01:10:46.527 --> 01:10:49.151
I'm telling you,
we don't need no
smart dead guy.

01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:51.902
Woo hoo hoo hoo.

01:10:51.902 --> 01:10:54.193
That's what I'm
talking about.

01:10:54.193 --> 01:10:55.985
Light that shit up.

01:10:58.527 --> 01:11:00.652

Well, guys. Hey!
This guy'll do.

01:11:59.443 --> 01:12:01.026
He's a President.

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:05.819
Yeah, he should know
all the fucking answers.

01:12:05.819 --> 01:12:08.735

Oh, no, no, no, no!
Wait, no, no!

You can't dig up
somebody's grave!
That's disgusting!

01:12:12.819 --> 01:12:15.610
You guys don't think
there's anything
wrong with this?

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:17.777
Huh?

01:12:25.902 --> 01:12:28.819

01:12:28.819 --> 01:12:30.944
Stop acting like
a little bitch.
Get the body.

01:12:30.944 --> 01:12:33.360

respect for an ex-President.

Who are you?
Can you see me?

01:13:12.026 --> 01:13:14.944
- Relax! Relax!
- It's not opening.
Open window!

01:13:14.944 --> 01:13:17.694
Yo, what the fuck
are we gonna do now?

01:13:17.694 --> 01:13:19.860
Fuck you think
we gonna do?

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:22.777
We gonna smoke his ass,
then we gonna start
asking questions.

01:13:22.777 --> 01:13:23.944
Wait a minute.

01:13:23.944 --> 01:13:26.026
Didn't you put
the ashes in the soil

01:13:26.026 --> 01:13:28.193
before you grew
the plant?

01:13:28.193 --> 01:13:29.860
We ain't got no time
for that shit.

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.819
We got to grind him now.
Get this on.

01:13:31.819 --> 01:13:35.068
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

01:13:35.068 --> 01:13:37.318
- ( Jeff whimpers )
- This is a President, man.

01:13:37.318 --> 01:13:38.777
What the fuck
are we doing?

01:13:38.777 --> 01:13:40.985
You want to stay
in Harvard or what?

01:13:40.985 --> 01:13:43.777
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:13:43.777 --> 01:13:45.735
I need money,
did you check him
for any jewelry

01:13:45.735 --> 01:13:47.527
or money on him
or anything?

01:13:47.527 --> 01:13:51.151
Fuck all that!
I'm cutting this arm now!

01:13:51.151 --> 01:13:53.819
- ( all screaming )
- Son of a-- shit!

01:13:55.193 --> 01:13:57.402
( gags )

01:13:57.402 --> 01:13:59.485
Get the arm!
Get the arm, man!

01:13:59.485 --> 01:14:00.860
Y'all calm down!
We got this!

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:03.318
- Calm down!
- JEFF: This is insane.

01:14:03.318 --> 01:14:06.485
- ( screaming, whimpering )
- Ohh, shit!

01:14:06.485 --> 01:14:08.860
- ( sobbing )
- You is a nasty motherfucker!

01:14:12.026 --> 01:14:14.860
( screaming )

01:14:17.777 --> 01:14:19.652
( groans )

01:14:23.902 --> 01:14:26.902
( whimpering )
I can't smoke a finger.

01:14:26.902 --> 01:14:29.568
( coughs, gags )

01:14:29.568 --> 01:14:31.026
This shit's not working.

01:14:34.026 --> 01:14:36.527
Hey, what up, bro's?

01:14:36.527 --> 01:14:39.318
I didn't know that you guys
were gonna be here!

01:14:39.318 --> 01:14:41.151
I saved your plant.

01:14:41.151 --> 01:14:44.568
What did you do to it?

01:14:44.568 --> 01:14:46.360
This is a special plant.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.151
I know.
( chuckles )

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:51.110
- You stole our plant!
- Damn right he stole
your plant.

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:54.026
Yo, Silas, this idiot
smoked up all the plant!

01:14:54.026 --> 01:14:55.902
You're gonna have
to study on your own.

01:14:55.902 --> 01:14:57.652
Damn, they can't
hear me or see me.

01:14:57.652 --> 01:15:00.235
- Tell 'em!
- S-S-Someone else
was breaking in here.

01:15:00.235 --> 01:15:03.402
So I caught them.
Maybe you can give me
a reward, right?

01:15:03.402 --> 01:15:07.110
- Like more of the plant?
- We ain't got no more
goddamn plant!

01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:09.360
Hoggin' all
the good shit, huh?
That's fine.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.527
( blows raspberry )
Let's go, Ivory!

01:15:11.527 --> 01:15:13.944
- Wait, Ivory here?
- Yeah, maybe.

01:15:13.944 --> 01:15:15.902
- IVORY: Repeat after me.
- Repeat after me.

01:15:15.902 --> 01:15:17.276
- Yo, dog!
- Yo, zog!

01:15:17.276 --> 01:15:19.068
- Dog!
- Zog!

01:15:19.068 --> 01:15:20.694
- You idiot!
- You idiot!

01:15:20.694 --> 01:15:22.944
- Shit, I'm disappearing.
- Shit, I'm disappearing.

01:15:22.944 --> 01:15:24.110
- What?
- What?

01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:26.068
- What?
- What?
- What?

01:15:28.527 --> 01:15:31.110
SILAS:
This reminds me
of my lab back at the crib.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.860
I have some
of this same stuff.

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.819
- How'd you get that?
- I stole it.

01:15:36.819 --> 01:15:39.193
Why don't you just place them
on the wall there?

01:15:39.193 --> 01:15:40.902
Well, well, well.

01:15:40.902 --> 01:15:45.819
Never thought I'd find
you two ghetto asses
up in here studying.

01:15:45.819 --> 01:15:47.568
Ghetto asses?

01:15:47.568 --> 01:15:49.151
Oh, did I say that?

01:15:49.151 --> 01:15:52.318
It must be the effects
of the brownies you sent me.

01:15:52.318 --> 01:15:54.276
They must still
be in my system.

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.652
Lauren, how's
the project coming?

01:15:57.652 --> 01:16:00.110
Fine.
As a matter of fact,

01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:03.735
I'm going to check
on that right now.
You know, I got to go.

01:16:03.735 --> 01:16:05.985
( whispering )
No, no, no, no, no.

01:16:05.985 --> 01:16:08.110
Yo, Dean, why you got
to be a hater?

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:09.985
Oh, yes, I'm a hater.

01:16:09.985 --> 01:16:12.652
I hate pot-smoking punks
that think everything

01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:14.527
should just be
given to them.

01:16:14.527 --> 01:16:17.485
You two are an absolute
disgrace to this university.

01:16:17.485 --> 01:16:20.652
Yo, Dean, man.
What are those?

01:16:20.652 --> 01:16:22.068
Oh, these?

01:16:22.068 --> 01:16:24.318
These are invitations
to the alumni celebration

01:16:24.318 --> 01:16:26.777
in which the Vice President
will be attending.

01:16:26.777 --> 01:16:28.527
And Lauren will be
unveiling

01:16:28.527 --> 01:16:30.694
her Benjamin Franklin
experiment.

01:16:30.694 --> 01:16:33.151
- Ah.
- Certain students
will be invited.

01:16:33.151 --> 01:16:35.026
Those that pass
their finals.

01:16:35.026 --> 01:16:37.568
- For real?
- But you won't pass
your finals.

01:16:37.568 --> 01:16:40.235
You'll fail, and then I'll
have you out of my hair

01:16:40.235 --> 01:16:41.819
and out of Harvard.

01:16:41.819 --> 01:16:44.110
( chuckles )
Happy studying, gentlemen.

01:16:45.151 --> 01:16:47.276
Fuck!

01:16:47.276 --> 01:16:49.860
I'm trying to do my thing.
It's pimpin' over here, baby.

01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:52.110
Baby Powder, when you gonna
pay us our money?

01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:54.735
- I got a $25 money order--
- $25?

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:56.735
- Money order?
- That you bitches can split.

01:16:56.735 --> 01:16:58.610
BOTH:
Who you calling
a bitch, bitch?

01:16:58.610 --> 01:17:00.360
- Come on with it.
- I got ya.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.944
Oh! If it ain't
Ricepuff Daddy.

01:17:02.944 --> 01:17:05.694
No, no, Powder,
that's Run-MSG.

01:17:05.694 --> 01:17:07.860
Hey, what you
listening to, brother?

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.860
- Wu-Tang.
- Wu-Tang.

01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:12.235
♪ Wu-Tang,
I came to bring the pain... ♪

01:17:12.235 --> 01:17:14.402
( both singing )

01:17:14.402 --> 01:17:16.276
I-- we don't listen
to that Chinese shit!

01:17:16.276 --> 01:17:18.402
- We do this little trip.
- This what we do.

01:17:18.402 --> 01:17:20.026
- You guys!
- Show 'em, Powder!

01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:21.944
- Powder, you a genius.
- You need to sit down.

01:17:21.944 --> 01:17:25.026
I'm gonna round them
almond eyes of yours out!

01:17:25.026 --> 01:17:27.235
- You understand me pimpin'?
- Hold on, Powder.

01:17:27.235 --> 01:17:30.819
Let's not get ig'nant.
Maybe he just came here
to pay our money.

01:17:30.819 --> 01:17:34.110
- No, I come for your girls.
( snaps bras )
- Wooo!

01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:37.443
You're gonna come back
and give me them two
duck sauces your mama--

01:17:37.443 --> 01:17:40.777
- You can't hold me back!
- Go Tuan!

01:17:40.777 --> 01:17:42.694
Let me get
my stinkin' blade out.

01:17:42.694 --> 01:17:44.276
Let me get my blade out.
I'm gonna--

01:17:44.276 --> 01:17:45.318
( karate yell )

01:17:45.318 --> 01:17:47.151
- Ooh, shit!
- Come on, bee-atch.

01:17:47.151 --> 01:17:50.026
Man, it was two egg rolls.
It wasn't the duck sauce.

01:17:51.819 --> 01:17:54.068
- ( car alarm ringing )
- Oooh!  Ow!

01:17:55.902 --> 01:17:57.860
Who the bitch now, bitch?

01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.360
Bee-atch!

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:02.568
I need to slap
my goddamn self for that.

01:18:02.568 --> 01:18:06.485
Pimps go through
this kind of shit
from time to time.

01:18:06.485 --> 01:18:08.527
( chuckling )

01:18:09.819 --> 01:18:12.235
( phone rings )

01:18:12.235 --> 01:18:13.902
Yes, Dean Cain here.

01:18:13.902 --> 01:18:16.902
Yes, I did receive them.
As a matter of fact,

01:18:16.902 --> 01:18:20.568
I was just going over
Silas and Jamal's grades,

01:18:20.568 --> 01:18:22.485
and I see they're all F's.

01:18:22.485 --> 01:18:24.860
Yes, I agree.

01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:27.944
Very sad.
Very sad, indeed.

01:18:27.944 --> 01:18:29.360
Yes. Well,

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.110
I'll speak to you later.
Bye bye.

01:18:33.777 --> 01:18:36.610
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:18:38.402 --> 01:18:41.443
TUAN: Hey!

01:18:42.443 --> 01:18:45.735
Dean Cain expects us
off campus by Monday.

01:18:45.735 --> 01:18:48.193
It went that bad
in botany class?

01:18:48.193 --> 01:18:50.902
Kid lost
about 15 pounds of fluid.

01:18:50.902 --> 01:18:52.443
And that was
just from the mouth.

01:18:52.443 --> 01:18:55.735
And I'm still below a 2.0.

01:18:55.735 --> 01:18:57.944
We gonna get kicked
the fuck out this school.

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:00.985
Maybe I can go back
to being your manager,

01:19:00.985 --> 01:19:03.777
and you strip
at that club again
like you used to.

01:19:03.777 --> 01:19:05.151
( chuckles )

01:19:05.151 --> 01:19:08.318
No, you can't give up!
You can't let the dean win.

01:19:08.318 --> 01:19:11.819
Did Commander Riker give up
when the Borg infiltrated
the Starship Enterprise

01:19:11.819 --> 01:19:14.652
and Captain Picard came back
all half-robot?

01:19:14.652 --> 01:19:17.485
The Borgs?
They're here!

01:19:17.485 --> 01:19:19.568
Oh, God!
Run for your lives!

01:19:19.568 --> 01:19:21.402
( Gerald screams, falls )

01:19:21.402 --> 01:19:25.068
- The point is--
- My point is shut
the fuck up.

01:19:25.068 --> 01:19:27.443
It's over.

01:19:27.443 --> 01:19:30.610
And we outta here.
Washing my hands.

01:19:32.193 --> 01:19:34.193
Silas, man,
you can't give up.

01:19:34.193 --> 01:19:36.819
If you get
this botany grade changed,
they have to keep you.

01:19:38.318 --> 01:19:40.652
Yeah. My--
my truth serum.

01:19:40.652 --> 01:19:42.360
- Yeah.
- I got to fix it.

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.360
- That's right.
- Yo!

01:19:51.193 --> 01:19:52.985
Here's your coffee.

01:19:55.151 --> 01:19:57.026
SILAS: Nausea.

01:19:58.402 --> 01:20:00.485
( chuckles )

01:20:08.902 --> 01:20:10.568
Ah, Bart, nice to see you.

01:20:10.568 --> 01:20:13.402
Listen, I think
I have a solution

01:20:13.402 --> 01:20:15.026
to your little problem.

01:20:15.026 --> 01:20:17.652
Oh, no. I already got
the prescription filled.

01:20:17.652 --> 01:20:19.819
Zing!
( chuckles softly )

01:20:19.819 --> 01:20:21.527
Not that problem.

01:20:21.527 --> 01:20:23.026
I'm talking about the boys.

01:20:23.026 --> 01:20:26.276
Those rejects
have been rejected.

01:20:26.276 --> 01:20:30.026
Yo, Dean Cain!
Look who's back.

01:20:30.026 --> 01:20:32.860
Holler.

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.944
PHIL:
Dean, what a surprise.
Look who's here.

01:20:34.944 --> 01:20:36.985
- How exciting.
- Guys we weren't
expecting you,

01:20:36.985 --> 01:20:38.694
but you're right on time.

01:20:38.694 --> 01:20:41.902
Let's go meet the next
likely leader of the free world.

01:20:44.527 --> 01:20:46.151
What are you two
doing here?

01:20:46.151 --> 01:20:48.402
Couldn't have
my future ex-wife

01:20:48.402 --> 01:20:50.193
show up
to some bigwig event

01:20:50.193 --> 01:20:52.568
without her daddy
on her arms.

01:20:52.568 --> 01:20:55.402
- Ain't that right, baby?
- Right, Daddy.

01:20:56.443 --> 01:20:58.985
Old friends, fellow alums,

01:20:58.985 --> 01:21:01.568
it's wonderful
being back here at Harvard.

01:21:01.568 --> 01:21:03.985
And I get to see
my beautiful daughter.

01:21:03.985 --> 01:21:05.777
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Daddy.

01:21:05.777 --> 01:21:07.902
Daddy?
This is Jamal.

01:21:07.902 --> 01:21:10.985
- Jamal, this is my dad.
- Ah-ha. Hello, Jamal.

01:21:10.985 --> 01:21:13.276
Mr. President.
And I call you Mr. President

01:21:13.276 --> 01:21:15.860
'cause I know
you gonna rock this election.

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.110
I hope you're right, son.
Uh-oh. Camera.

01:21:25.735 --> 01:21:27.777
All right, Ivory,
this is the last of you.

01:21:27.777 --> 01:21:29.485
Do your stuff.

01:21:29.485 --> 01:21:32.276
- Ah!
- Oh, hey, Professor.

01:21:32.276 --> 01:21:34.443
- What's going on?
- Nice to see you again.

01:21:34.443 --> 01:21:37.402
Listen, tonight
I got a feeling you're gonna
see my experiment work.

01:21:37.402 --> 01:21:40.068
I hope we don't have
to pass out any barf bags.

01:21:40.068 --> 01:21:41.777
Don't even
worry about that.

01:21:41.777 --> 01:21:43.819
See, I found
my secret ingredient.

01:21:43.819 --> 01:21:46.610
By adding a little bit
of chro-- cannibis,

01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:48.694
I was able
to counteract the nausea.

01:21:48.694 --> 01:21:50.694
I'm proud of you.

01:21:50.694 --> 01:21:52.485
Thank you, Professor.
Thank you, man.

01:21:57.694 --> 01:22:00.694
- I actually feel wonderful.
- Isn't he great, Daddy?

01:22:00.694 --> 01:22:03.652
BOTH:
Yeah. He's great.

01:22:05.777 --> 01:22:08.110
( laughing )

01:22:09.985 --> 01:22:12.151
Ow!

01:22:12.151 --> 01:22:13.652
Secret Service!

01:22:13.652 --> 01:22:16.652
Hey, Jamie, here's your dad
after a frat party!

01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:20.694
We don't want the dean
to get his panties in a bunch!

01:22:20.694 --> 01:22:22.985
- Carl, it's all right.
- He might want a spanking!

01:22:22.985 --> 01:22:25.110
Sit down.

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:30.360
JAMAL:
Wait a minute.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.276
I know y'all ain't
playing grab-ass

01:22:32.276 --> 01:22:35.276
while I'm entertaining
my future vanilla villa
father are ya?

01:22:35.276 --> 01:22:37.860
- Yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Mm-hm. Yeah?

01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.860
Man, look.
The serum working.
They high, dog! Look!

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.819
Hey, man, look.
I got something to tell you.

01:22:42.819 --> 01:22:45.151
Man, I've been pinching
your weed off.

01:22:45.151 --> 01:22:48.527
- What you telling me for?
- Damn! I don't know.

01:22:48.527 --> 01:22:51.318
I guess it's
that new serum, man.
I'm sorry, man.

01:22:51.318 --> 01:22:54.193
- That's okay.
Don't worry about it.
- It ain't all right.

01:22:54.193 --> 01:22:57.402
I been taking your CDs,
I been using your weed pipes,

01:22:57.402 --> 01:23:00.819
- I even been looking
at Lauren's ass.
- Whoa!

01:23:00.819 --> 01:23:03.694
She's fine!
And if she gave me
the chance,

01:23:03.694 --> 01:23:06.235
I would wax that ass
till she showed me
what she wa--

01:23:06.235 --> 01:23:07.819
Whoa, whoa, bro.

01:23:07.819 --> 01:23:11.110
Jamal, I will take that
as a compliment.

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:13.068
( mutters )

01:23:14.068 --> 01:23:15.443
Thank you.

01:23:15.443 --> 01:23:17.902
We all know that Harvard
has been honored to host

01:23:17.902 --> 01:23:20.193
some of Benjamin Franklin's
artifacts,

01:23:20.193 --> 01:23:22.485
which I personally found.

01:23:22.485 --> 01:23:24.193
Like this cannon-like
article back here.

01:23:24.193 --> 01:23:25.777
Now later,
you can take note

01:23:25.777 --> 01:23:28.402
of the foot-operated
carburetor,

01:23:28.402 --> 01:23:32.318
the reservoir,
and the top-loading bud bowl.

01:23:32.318 --> 01:23:33.610
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:36.151
Harvard is now
the proud owner

01:23:36.151 --> 01:23:39.443
of America's first...bong.

01:23:39.443 --> 01:23:41.527
( gasping )

01:23:41.527 --> 01:23:43.860
DEAN CAIN:
A bong?!

01:23:45.151 --> 01:23:46.902
This is outrageous!

01:23:46.902 --> 01:23:48.944
If Benjamin Franklin
were here today,

01:23:48.944 --> 01:23:51.318
he would deny
and denounce

01:23:51.318 --> 01:23:53.902
any claim to these
so-called findings!

01:23:53.902 --> 01:23:57.402
I'm gonna have
to disagree on that.

01:23:57.402 --> 01:23:59.694
Yo, Ben, tell this fool.
Is that a bong or what?

01:23:59.694 --> 01:24:01.735
Yup, it's
the liberty bong.

01:24:01.735 --> 01:24:03.276
Light that shit.

01:24:03.276 --> 01:24:07.276
BOTH:
Smoke that shit.
Pass that shit.

01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:09.777
- You got to come
to this party, Ben.
- You got a party?

01:24:10.902 --> 01:24:12.735
Hey, man. Hey.

01:24:12.735 --> 01:24:14.443
- Come on, man, smoke.
- Gerald!

01:24:15.985 --> 01:24:18.568
Oh, yeah.

01:24:18.568 --> 01:24:20.527
( crowd laughing )

01:24:20.527 --> 01:24:22.819
- This is insane!
- ( laughing )

01:24:22.819 --> 01:24:24.735
What are you all
laughing at?!

01:24:24.735 --> 01:24:26.819
Dean, I have had it
with your uptight,

01:24:26.819 --> 01:24:29.985
self-serving,
over-opinionated ass!

01:24:29.985 --> 01:24:32.777
- JAMAL: Get him!
- In short, you are fired!

01:24:32.777 --> 01:24:34.819
( gasps )

01:24:34.819 --> 01:24:37.151
Oh, hit the bricks, dog!

01:24:57.485 --> 01:25:00.235
Yo, dog, man.
Look like you did it, dog.

01:25:00.235 --> 01:25:01.819
You got a new serum, man.

01:25:01.819 --> 01:25:04.276
You gonna be
an herbal scientist,
my brother.

01:25:04.276 --> 01:25:07.151
- Me and you turned this place
upside down, didn't we?
- Did we!

01:25:07.151 --> 01:25:09.485
Amazing what two brothers
from the PJ's

01:25:09.485 --> 01:25:11.694
could do with just a little bit
of opportunity.

01:25:11.694 --> 01:25:13.735
Word.

01:25:13.735 --> 01:25:16.443
- Holler at ya, dog.
- I will.

01:25:16.443 --> 01:25:18.527
- Whoo!
- ( woman screaming )

01:25:18.527 --> 01:25:21.026
- ( yelling )
- Oh, Secret Service!

01:25:24.235 --> 01:25:27.402
Wh-wh-whoa!
Dean, Dean, ease up
on the black-on-black crime.

01:25:27.402 --> 01:25:29.568
( yelling )

01:25:29.568 --> 01:25:33.026
Oh! This motherfucker
done messed up my shit!

01:25:33.026 --> 01:25:35.360
Back up, nigga!
You better give me three feet!

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.985
Give me three feet!

01:25:37.819 --> 01:25:39.527
Whoa!

01:25:40.485 --> 01:25:42.026
( groans )

01:25:43.151 --> 01:25:45.026
Hey, get up.

01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:48.402
Oh, cool.

01:25:48.402 --> 01:25:51.068
- Take him away, boys.
- Take your hands off of me!

01:25:51.068 --> 01:25:53.694
Do you realize who I am?
What are you looking at?!

01:25:53.694 --> 01:25:55.527
I need money!
You talked!

01:25:55.527 --> 01:25:57.443
Why yes, Jamal.

01:25:57.443 --> 01:25:59.276
It is somewhat
of a surprise to me, also.

01:25:59.276 --> 01:26:02.151
Lord, it's a gift!
It's a gift from above!

01:26:02.151 --> 01:26:03.985
Make you float
like a dove!

01:26:03.985 --> 01:26:06.902
Make you scream like Michael
in a rhinestone glove!

01:26:06.902 --> 01:26:08.235
Lord, Lord, Lord.

01:26:10.110 --> 01:26:12.402
BOTH:
Popcorn player.

01:26:14.902 --> 01:26:16.819
( coughs )

01:26:16.819 --> 01:26:19.151
I didn't inhale!
Whoo-hoo!

01:26:19.151 --> 01:26:21.694
God, this is
the wildest time
I've ever had.

01:26:21.694 --> 01:26:23.068
( laughing )

01:26:23.068 --> 01:26:24.735
Then you won't mind
that I'm

01:26:24.735 --> 01:26:26.235
banging your daughter
on the regular?

01:26:26.235 --> 01:26:27.652
No, no, not at all!

01:26:27.652 --> 01:26:29.944
Good, 'cause Jamal's
gonna be my baby daddy.

01:26:29.944 --> 01:26:31.652
VICE PRESIDENT: Ah.

01:26:31.652 --> 01:26:34.568
- Son, welcome
to the family.
- Daddy.

01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:40.151
Silas, your experiment
was a success.

01:26:40.151 --> 01:26:42.276
Your serum worked,

01:26:42.276 --> 01:26:44.777
and you're going
to get an "A"
in my course.

01:26:44.777 --> 01:26:47.360
- Ohh...Professor!
- So that means I get to stay?

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.610
You betcha!
You can stay as long
as it takes you to graduate.

01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:52.735
I don't care.
Right, ladies?

01:26:52.735 --> 01:26:55.610
- BOTH WOMEN: Mm-hm.
- Shall we, ladies?

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:58.235
BART:
Hey, down here!
This is not happening!

01:26:58.235 --> 01:27:01.568
Lauren, you are
coming with me!

01:27:01.568 --> 01:27:04.777
Honey, you have
never satisfied me.

01:27:04.777 --> 01:27:05.944
Huh?

01:27:06.819 --> 01:27:09.026
Silas?

01:27:09.026 --> 01:27:10.777
But I can.

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:22.610
Now the day you lay off
is the day you pay off.

01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:24.360
We come in here
to get our old bitches,

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.819
but if they ain't in here,

01:27:25.819 --> 01:27:27.443
we gonna get them
intellect bitches

01:27:27.443 --> 01:27:29.527
and start our
own new stable.
You feel me?

01:27:29.527 --> 01:27:32.193
Just keep it
pimp-alicious,
though, baby.

01:27:32.193 --> 01:27:34.026
Powder, what are
you doing here?

01:27:34.026 --> 01:27:35.902
What are you doing
in here, Phil?!

01:27:35.902 --> 01:27:38.443
I've been rolling
this joint for 20 years.

01:27:38.443 --> 01:27:40.151
But if these people
knew I was using

01:27:40.151 --> 01:27:43.360
your Dial-A-Ho service,
they might not understand.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:46.944
You are one
of my biggest customers.
You like them hand jobs.

01:27:46.944 --> 01:27:48.902
Fat bitches
pissing on you
all the time!

01:27:48.902 --> 01:27:51.151
- I like the ladies.
- Lickin' poodle feets.

01:27:51.151 --> 01:27:54.568
Let's stop it right there.
Have you ever been to college?

01:27:54.568 --> 01:27:56.402
Yeah, two years.
Pussyology.

01:27:56.402 --> 01:27:59.402
Academia. I like it.
Give me a call next week.

01:27:59.402 --> 01:28:02.527
I think we can work
something out.

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:05.527
Today's class is called
Pimpology I and II.

01:28:05.527 --> 01:28:07.527
I'm one, that's two.

01:28:07.527 --> 01:28:08.694
That's what
your ass will be

01:28:08.694 --> 01:28:11.360
if you don't pass
this class.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.193
It got to come out right!

01:28:13.193 --> 01:28:15.860
If it don't come out right
you ain't gonna get
to pimp tonight!

01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:18.151
- Where my bitches?
- Where my bitches?

01:28:18.151 --> 01:28:20.694
Come on with it,

01:28:20.694 --> 01:28:22.360
and let it fly!

01:28:24.151 --> 01:28:27.527
Not yourselves!
Shit!

01:28:27.527 --> 01:28:30.026
That was deep.
That was deep.

01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:34.193
And B-cam roll.
B marker.

01:28:34.193 --> 01:28:36.860
Cut!

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:40.360
And another thing.
I forgot my motherfuckin' line!

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.318
Yo, stop doing that shit.
You can't be laughing at me.

01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:46.276
Fuck my close-up up,
nigger.

01:28:46.276 --> 01:28:49.944
They know we stole
( laughs ) the statue.

01:28:49.944 --> 01:28:54.151
I knew it! ( laughing )
You guys and your lies!

01:28:54.151 --> 01:28:57.402
- SILAS: Can I get some pussy?
- Sure.  Come on in.

01:28:57.402 --> 01:28:59.777
I told you we shoulda
went to UCLA.

01:28:59.777 --> 01:29:03.402
I'm about to go stick my dick
in a thermos or something.

01:29:03.402 --> 01:29:04.777
( laughs )

01:29:04.777 --> 01:29:07.068
Puffs for purgatory.
For everybody. Line 'em up.

01:29:07.068 --> 01:29:09.360
- Puffs for purgatory, baby.
- Puffs for purgatory.

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.026
Puffs for purgatory!

01:29:11.026 --> 01:29:13.902
--see each other no more.
I mean, the fuckin' around,

01:29:13.902 --> 01:29:16.193
the s-- Ah, shit!
( laughs )

01:29:16.193 --> 01:29:18.527
( sneezes )

01:29:28.777 --> 01:29:30.694
I pledge allegiance
to the pimp,

01:29:30.694 --> 01:29:33.944

01:29:33.944 --> 01:29:36.777
SILAS:
Come on, you fuckers!
Call action!

01:29:36.777 --> 01:29:40.443
- Uh-oh.
- I don't give a fuck
if it breaks.

01:29:40.443 --> 01:29:43.151
You hear me?
God damn it!

01:29:43.151 --> 01:29:45.527
Turn that goddamn
water off!

01:29:45.527 --> 01:29:49.151
Cut, cut, cut.

01:29:49.151 --> 01:29:50.443

Cu-ut!

01:29:55.985 --> 01:29:59.443
