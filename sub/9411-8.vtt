Viewer beware.

00:24.867 --> 00:27.367
You're in for a scare.

00:29.867 --> 00:31.867

Where are we? Dad, are we lost?

- [ Man ] No. No, we're not lost.
- [ Woman Sighs ]

00:49.367 --> 00:52.600
[ Woman ] Let's find a gas station
and ask for directions.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.567
Honey, I don't do that.

00:55.567 --> 01:00.800
I'm getting hungry.
Are we almost there yet?

01:00.800 --> 01:06.533
Luke, now, you know the rules.
Don't keep asking me, "Are we there yet?"

01:06.533 --> 01:09.267
Because you'll know we're there
when we're there.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.600
It's boiling back here.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.600
Well, if your father would
have had the car fixed,

01:16.600 --> 01:18.433
we might have air conditioning
that worked.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.300
Hmm.

01:20.300 --> 01:23.233
[ Sighs ]
Great vacation.

01:23.233 --> 01:26.567
I don't understand it.
Zoo Gardens should be right here.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.767
It's probably one of those zoos
where all they have is sheep anyway.

01:30.267 --> 01:31.733
No, it's not.
It sounded cool.

01:31.733 --> 01:35.167
Would you please ask for directions?

01:35.167 --> 01:39.133
- It should be right here on the map.
- Let's find a gas station.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.367
- A gas station? I don't even see a road.
- [ Sighs ]

I bet the rides are really scary.
Let's go. Can we?

03:10.400 --> 03:12.667

go on a couple of rides while
we ask where Zoo Gardens is.

04:28.133 --> 04:31.100

- So?
- I mean, it--

15:06.567 --> 15:10.067

Maybe. I just wanna find
our kids and get out of here.

15:26.033 --> 15:28.267
Okay, okay.
Just-Just take it easy.

15:28.267 --> 15:32.767
- [ Luke ] This is really cool!
- [ Lizzy ] I don't like it.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.433
[ Creature Chuckling ]

15:39.400 --> 15:43.333
[ Straining ]
Arr. Here we go.

15:46.833 --> 15:49.333
[ Strains ]
Y-Y-Yo! Ah.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.000
Lay back and enjoy the ride.

15:52.500 --> 15:57.000
It may be your last.
[ Cackling ]

15:57.000 --> 16:01.367
Bye-bye.
[ Continues Cackling ]

16:06.367 --> 16:09.367
This is kind of relaxing.

16:10.867 --> 16:12.500
It's boring, if you ask me.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.800
[ Motor Whirring ]

16:18.267 --> 16:23.033
[ Coughs ]
Hey, open up.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.833
- Hey, open up!
- [ Knocking On Lid ]

16:26.767 --> 16:30.467
Okay. Calm down, Lizzy.
It's just a ride.

16:30.967 --> 16:34.100
The lid'll be open soon.
It'll all be over.

16:34.100 --> 16:37.567
How you doing, Liz?

16:39.067 --> 16:43.067
Deep breaths. One, two--

16:44.067 --> 16:45.967
Get me out of here!

16:45.967 --> 16:49.133
- [ Lizzy ] Open up!
- [ Giggling ]

17:00.733 --> 17:02.767
- [ Continues Giggling ]
- [ Bangs ]

17:07.133 --> 17:11.800
- How are you doing?
- Get me out of here!

17:11.800 --> 17:15.233
Oh, Lizzy, it's just a ride.

17:16.166 --> 17:19.367
[ Gasps, Shouts ]

17:19.867 --> 17:23.067
[ Whimpering ]

17:25.567 --> 17:28.967
[ Whimpering, Breathing Heavily ]

17:28.967 --> 17:31.333
No spider.

17:31.333 --> 17:35.333
Thank you for taking Coffin Cruises.
Step to the left, please.

17:35.333 --> 17:38.333
- That was really gross.   - No kidding.
Why'd you let me go on that thing?

17:38.333 --> 17:40.800
Let's get outta here!

17:43.233 --> 17:46.667
[ Chuckling ]

17:46.667 --> 17:51.667
My legs are still itching. I wonder
how they did that spider effect.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.900
I don't care. I just wish I was
in Zoo Gardens watching sheep.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.933
- [ Motor Whirring ]
- [ Lizzy ] Come on.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.667
Yeah, it's this way.

18:07.200 --> 18:11.200
[ Creature Chuckling, Chuckling ]

18:15.367 --> 18:18.867
There's no one around.
Are you sure this is the right way?

18:20.367 --> 18:23.367
- [ Animal Squealing, Grunting ]
- Who's there?

18:24.367 --> 18:26.367
Who's there?

18:27.867 --> 18:31.367
This doesn't look right. Come on.
It's gotta be around this way.

18:31.367 --> 18:33.367
I feel like someone's watching us.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.767
Come on.

18:35.767 --> 18:41.167
[ Creature Breathing Heavily ]

18:43.167 --> 18:48.333
[ Grunting, Chuckling ]

18:55.000 --> 18:56.667
[ Gasps ]
Dad!

18:56.667 --> 18:59.667
It's all right. It's all right.

19:00.067 --> 19:03.567
Listen, kids, we're leaving. There's
something not quite right about this place.

19:03.567 --> 19:05.067
I know. It's like this place
is for real or something.

19:05.067 --> 19:07.067
Talk about this in the car.

19:07.700 --> 19:11.633
- I just want us out of here right now.
- All right. Let's go.

19:18.300 --> 19:22.867
[ Creature Huffing, Growling ]

19:25.633 --> 19:29.667
- You go that way, and we'll follow them.
- [ Animal Grunting ]

19:32.167 --> 19:35.167
Luke. Luke, come on.
Let's stay together.

19:37.167 --> 19:40.667
- Is this the way we came in?
- It looks like it.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.367
It's gotta be. I can see
the parking lot from here.

19:43.367 --> 19:46.367
- We're locked in.
- Oh.

19:46.867 --> 19:50.667
Guys, look at this:
"No exit"?

19:51.600 --> 19:54.167
"No one leaves Horrorland alive"?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.067
"No one leaves Horrorland alive."

20:05.067 --> 20:08.533
- What is that, some-- some kind of joke?
- It's gotta be a joke.

20:08.533 --> 20:11.500
- We should find the manager.
- They have to let us out of here, right?

20:11.500 --> 20:14.400
- Of course they do.
- [ Rattles ]

20:14.833 --> 20:17.433
That's not gonna do any good.
Go find the manager. Come on.

20:17.433 --> 20:20.700
If you ask me,
there's a lawsuit here!

20:22.300 --> 20:24.133
- I-I wanna go home.
- Hello!

20:24.133 --> 20:26.467
We should have gone to Zoo Gardens.

20:26.467 --> 20:30.133
- Hello, is anybody working here?
- There's gotta be someone around.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.767
- [ Grunts ] Leaving so soon?
- [ Mom ] Oh!

20:32.767 --> 20:35.200
[ Creature Snorting ]
You haven't gone on all the rides!

20:35.200 --> 20:37.667
[ Mom Whimpering, Gasps ]

20:37.667 --> 20:40.300
- We want you to stay.
- [ Screeching ]
