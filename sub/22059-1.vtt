I can make a difference, Alfred.
I know I can.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.586
Previously on The Exorcist...

00:18.619 --> 00:20.654
What can you tell me
about demonic possession?

00:20.688 --> 00:22.090
That's an excellent question.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.757
Go home, Father Tomas.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.026
-Show me what to do.
-You want to know what happens?

00:26.060 --> 00:27.995
It's not just your career
on the line, Tomas.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.863
It's your immortal soul.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.499
Your excommunication.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.201
The order
effective immediately.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.503
-So, who are you waiting for?
-You.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.837
I need you. Will you help me?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.606
-TOMAS: Pray for us.
-St. Lawrence.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.841
-Lies. -Saints John and Paul...
-Pray for us.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.777
I silence you, unclean spirit!

00:43.811 --> 00:45.679
Train me.
To become an exorcist.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.448
Understand what
you're asking, Tomas.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.350
But He chose me.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.119
And I am going to
get out of the boat

00:51.152 --> 00:52.753
and start walking.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.458
(whispering indistinctly)

00:57.491 --> 00:59.460
(voices echoing)

01:22.082 --> 01:24.084
(children laughing in distance)

01:29.623 --> 01:32.092
(doors creak)

01:32.126 --> 01:34.094
(children laughing in distance)

01:37.531 --> 01:39.500
TOMAS:
Hello?

01:53.046 --> 01:56.950
* I walk for miles
along the highway *

01:56.984 --> 02:00.921
* Well, that's just my way

02:00.954 --> 02:02.323
* Of saying I love you...

02:02.356 --> 02:03.757
Cindy?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.859
Father Tomas.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.562
-Where are we?
-* After midnight...

02:08.596 --> 02:10.964
This is my little miracle.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.201
Isn't she something?

02:13.234 --> 02:15.068
(coos)

02:15.102 --> 02:17.171
(children cheering,
hitting piÃ±ata)

02:17.205 --> 02:19.540
* Crying on his pillow

02:19.573 --> 02:23.577
* Maybe he's crying

02:23.611 --> 02:27.748
* For me

02:27.781 --> 02:30.117
(echoing thud)

02:30.150 --> 02:31.919
* And as the skies

02:31.952 --> 02:34.788
-* Turn gloomy
-(children scream)

02:34.822 --> 02:37.791
* Night winds whisper to me

02:37.825 --> 02:39.993
(screaming continues)

02:40.027 --> 02:45.165
* I'm lonesome as I

02:47.000 --> 02:49.002
(groaning, bubbling)

02:56.877 --> 03:00.681
(distorted):
* I go out walkin'...

03:00.714 --> 03:02.283
CINDY (demonic voice):
St. Cecilia, pray for us.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.952
St. Catherine, pray for us.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.654
MARCUS:
St. Anastasia, pray for us!

03:06.687 --> 03:08.789
Tomas!

03:08.822 --> 03:10.090
Oh!

03:10.123 --> 03:12.526
(tires skidding)

03:14.194 --> 03:15.329
What are you doing?

03:15.363 --> 03:16.964
Trying to save your life!

03:16.997 --> 03:18.532
Well, try doing it
on the bloody road!

03:18.566 --> 03:19.867
Stay with me, Cindy.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.669
In the name God, the Father
and all his hosts,

03:21.702 --> 03:24.605
I command you
release this woman!

03:24.638 --> 03:26.407
(growling)

03:26.440 --> 03:28.509
MARCUS:
We got company!

03:28.542 --> 03:29.577
I reckon it's her husband!

03:31.412 --> 03:33.381
(horn honking)

03:34.848 --> 03:35.983
They're gaining!

03:36.016 --> 03:37.217
Faster, Tomas!

03:37.251 --> 03:39.152
(tires skidding)

03:41.389 --> 03:42.256
(gun cocks)

03:42.290 --> 03:43.357
Get down!

03:44.725 --> 03:45.893
(laughs)

03:45.926 --> 03:47.595
Drive!

03:51.332 --> 03:54.735
*

04:10.751 --> 04:11.919
*

04:33.307 --> 04:35.609
*

04:37.411 --> 04:40.914
-(engine turns off)
-Easy, easy, sweetheart.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.389
(roaring)

04:48.422 --> 04:50.824
Sweetheart, not a sound.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.263
Shh...

04:56.296 --> 04:57.097
(hand crunches)

04:57.130 --> 04:58.298
(grunts)

04:59.767 --> 05:02.302
(panting)

05:06.273 --> 05:08.442
(sighs)

05:09.343 --> 05:10.811
(engine revs)

05:10.844 --> 05:12.613
(sighs)

05:12.646 --> 05:15.148
Remind me to have a word
with our friend Bennett

05:15.182 --> 05:16.584
about his intel.

05:16.617 --> 05:17.918
Conveniently left out the part

05:17.951 --> 05:19.753
about the bloody
extended family.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.021
CINDY (demonic voice):
"He that eateth my flesh,

05:21.054 --> 05:23.824
"and drinketh my blood,

05:23.857 --> 05:26.927
"dwelleth in me.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.497
And I in him."

05:29.530 --> 05:33.300
(Cindy laughs)

05:33.333 --> 05:34.402
(gasping)

05:34.435 --> 05:36.970
MARCUS:
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.472
We need to get her stabilized.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.040
Before the sheriff comes back.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.510
We could talk to him
to make him see reason.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.212
Did you miss the part where he
started taking potshots at us?

05:45.245 --> 05:46.980
Well, we did kidnap his wife.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.582
Yeah, 'cause he didn't
believe us.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.283
If we hadn't,
she'd be dead by now.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.485
I'm just saying,
he could have every cop

05:51.519 --> 05:53.020
in the county after us.

05:53.053 --> 05:56.323
When I agreed to take you on
as an apprentice,

05:56.356 --> 05:57.958
you promised to follow my lead.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.960
And I have, for six months.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.729
So trust me now.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.196
We're close.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.765
Cindy's still in there.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.334
Losing a child...

06:07.367 --> 06:09.770
No mother should have
to go through that.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.372
Let's finish this.

06:12.406 --> 06:16.176
First, we have to get off
this damn road.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.211
(engine starts)

06:30.323 --> 06:32.325
(birds chirping)

06:34.528 --> 06:36.997
ANDY:
Kids, shake tail!

06:37.030 --> 06:40.501
You're gonna miss the ferry.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.335
Caleb!

06:42.369 --> 06:43.537
Shelby!

06:43.571 --> 06:46.406
Verity, Truck! Come on.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.308
Truck, here you go.
What are we gonna do?

06:48.341 --> 06:49.943
Save it for lunch?

06:49.977 --> 06:52.012
Very good, I don't want you
to be hungry later.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.413
You're my favorite.

06:53.447 --> 06:54.948
Caleb, Shelby!

06:54.982 --> 06:57.384
-Shelby. One for you.
-Mm-hmm.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.187
And an extra one for Truck.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.389
Very important blind kid
coming through.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.991
You're blind?

07:04.024 --> 07:06.226
Verity! It's now or never.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.928
I choose "never."

07:07.961 --> 07:09.797
Never's not an option.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.331
Okay, get out of my house.
Go to school.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.766
-Okay, fine.
-Oh, remember.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.736
Rose is coming tonight at 6:00.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.739
-Six o'clock.
-Can't freaking wait.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.207
Which means whatever
you're doing in the woods

07:20.240 --> 07:22.075
today after school,
please get home in time

07:22.109 --> 07:23.376
to do something
about all of this.

07:23.410 --> 07:24.444
-Okay?
-Clear.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.946
Dude, we got this.

07:25.979 --> 07:26.980
Hey, don't call me dude, bro.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.082
This place is crawling
in dude-bros.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.718
I'm gonna tell
Social Worker Lady

07:30.751 --> 07:33.253
that it's a hostile
foster home environment.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.922
-SHELBY: Bye!
-CALEB: Bye.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.625
-Love you, Verity.
-Bye.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.992
(door closes)

07:40.828 --> 07:42.830
Grace?

07:55.108 --> 07:57.077
GRACE:
Are they going to school?

07:57.110 --> 07:59.580
You want to try it
with them out there?

08:03.984 --> 08:06.554
That's okay.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.623
Whenever you're ready.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.258
It does not matter.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.060
That's why we do
our homeschool thing, right?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.798
I made you your favorite.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.466
The Elvis?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.734
You're welcome.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.502
-Thank you.
-No.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.137
(imitates Elvis):
Thank you very much.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.172
(laughs)

08:25.205 --> 08:27.174
Remember that lady from, uh,

08:27.207 --> 08:29.109
Social Services
I told you about?

08:29.142 --> 08:31.078
She's coming to stay
with us for a few days.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.680
I thought it'd be nice if--

08:32.713 --> 08:37.184
if you want-- if you come down
to dinner tonight and join us.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.419
What do you think?

08:39.452 --> 08:41.589
You can wear your brave face.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.027
Hey, where's Grace?

08:47.060 --> 08:48.696
(laughs):
I'm Grace.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.565
-Oh, you're... you're Grace.
-(giggles)

08:51.599 --> 08:53.934
No. I didn't recognize you.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.636
(giggles)
You're weird.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.070
You're weird.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.406
Come down if you
change your mind, all right?

09:13.520 --> 09:15.488
(engine turns off)

09:15.522 --> 09:17.524
(car door closes)

09:25.098 --> 09:27.100
*

09:49.122 --> 09:52.192
Bet you're regretting
turning down that promotion.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.661
Could be back in Chicago,
right now,

09:53.694 --> 09:55.228
hobnobbing with the rich
and powerful.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.231
It's not the rich and powerful
that I miss.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.967
What, then?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.368
My own bed.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.704
Hearing confession.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.039
My sister's cooking.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.608
Six months,
the man's already homesick.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.644
Lob us that strap.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.050
Something happened
back there, Marcus.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.787
To me, in the truck.

10:23.090 --> 10:26.126
When I was driving, all of
a sudden, I was somewhere else.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.496
Go on.

10:29.529 --> 10:32.165
It was some sort of party, uh...

10:33.801 --> 10:35.068
Cindy was there.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.804
She had a child.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.472
There were kids playing.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.909
Something came out of a piÃ±ata.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.510
You're knackered.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.713
We haven't slept in days.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.115
(whispers):
I know what I saw.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.284
-(Cindy gasping, wheezing)
-Shh...

10:52.686 --> 10:54.287
Simmer down, sweetheart.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.257
Cindy, I need you to follow
my voice, listen to it,

10:57.290 --> 10:59.026
-follow it.
-(gasping): It... it hurts.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.828
I know, I know.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.630
Just stay with me-- it'll
be over soon, I promise you.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.133
Her organs are failing.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.168
I need to get her
on an intravenous drip.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.103
There was a town a few miles
back-- I need salt,

11:10.137 --> 11:11.972
uh, distilled water, some
of them little bendy straws,

11:12.005 --> 11:14.507
if they got 'em,
sewing needles and staples.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.177
-Then maybe you should go.
-No, you'll be fine.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.780
You don't want me
to stay alone with her?

11:19.813 --> 11:21.314
What are you afraid of?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.717
We're running out of time,
Tomas.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.596
(door creaks)

11:38.465 --> 11:41.501
(demonic voice):
Yes, send the boy away.

11:41.534 --> 11:45.005
Like it even matters.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.707
I'll have him.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.310
You were right to be worried.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.546
He has talents
you'll never possess.

11:53.580 --> 11:57.117
He shared them with me.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.956
(laughing)

12:02.990 --> 12:04.892
What did you say?

12:04.925 --> 12:08.896
I saw him from the inside.

12:08.929 --> 12:13.000
He opened his mind to me.
He let me in.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.169
He's a very beautiful man.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.437
(chuckles)

12:19.106 --> 12:22.042
(laughing)

12:22.075 --> 12:24.611
(birds chirping)

12:27.347 --> 12:29.582
VERITY: You guys heard about
the Island Witch?

12:29.616 --> 12:32.385
-Yeah, there's no Island Witch.
-I'd like to talk about her.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.855
-There's definitely
an Island Witch. -Oh, yeah?

12:34.888 --> 12:36.824
Maybe you're the witch.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.759
TRUCK: I used to think
my mom was a witch,

12:39.793 --> 12:44.597
-because she was mean.
-Thank you, Truck.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.934
VERITY: She lined up all the
kids from littlest to biggest

12:46.967 --> 12:48.902
and she made them all
drink the poison.

12:48.936 --> 12:52.072
Yeah, last time
you said she hanged them.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.508
No, poison.
Ask anyone.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.510
She made them drink
every last drop

12:57.544 --> 12:59.312
and when they died,

12:59.346 --> 13:02.082
the Island Witch dumped their
bodies down this very well.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.284
* Bum, bum, bum.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.920
They say anyone brave enough

13:06.954 --> 13:09.056
to stand on the cover
for ten seconds,

13:09.089 --> 13:11.358
can still hear their
dying gasps.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.160
That's stupid.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.262
That's why it's a test.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.831
And when you pass,
you're one of us.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.466
After that, there's nothing
you can't do.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.800
Except see.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.836
Thank you, Truck.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.442
-Seriously, she's messing
with you. -I'm not scared.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.745
Then prove it.
Count to ten.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.048
One, two, three...

13:35.082 --> 13:37.817
-Nope.
-(grunts) Hey, put me down.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.153
-Not cool, V.
-What?

13:40.187 --> 13:42.722
I can do what I want.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.133
(door creaks)

13:53.166 --> 13:54.935
(ball bouncing)

13:54.968 --> 13:57.004
(demonic whispering)

13:59.206 --> 14:01.641
(ball stops bouncing)

14:01.674 --> 14:03.176
SHELBY:
Truck!

14:03.210 --> 14:05.212
(whispering stops)

14:14.021 --> 14:16.356
(demonic whispering)

14:19.659 --> 14:21.661
(seabirds squawking)

14:27.901 --> 14:29.169
(boat bell dings)

14:33.240 --> 14:35.242
(boat bell dings)

14:36.276 --> 14:38.011
(boat horn blows)

14:40.247 --> 14:43.883
(indistinct chatter over radio)

14:43.917 --> 14:46.519
*

14:52.492 --> 14:55.262
-Hey.
-Let me get that.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.997
-Good to see you.
-Yeah, good to...

14:57.030 --> 14:59.399
-You know what,
I'm just gonna... -Yeah, okay.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.768
(both laugh)

15:03.036 --> 15:04.938
You look wonderful.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.007
Thank you. So do you.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.575
(chuckling):
Thank you.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.111
-I was fishing for a compliment.
-(both chuckle)

15:13.746 --> 15:15.215
I like it.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.549
That...

15:16.583 --> 15:18.418
Your hair is so much longer.

15:18.451 --> 15:22.255
Yeah, yeah. That's-that's
what it does; it-it grows.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.892
There goes that plan.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.860
-What plan?
-I was hoping to be real smooth.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.263
Start off on the right foot
with you.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.472
*

15:47.514 --> 15:49.449
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.952
(Andy clears throat)

15:59.526 --> 16:01.261
-Beautiful.
-Thank you.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.130
Yeah, we got
a good thing going here.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.765
You know, for some of these
kids, it's the closest thing

16:05.798 --> 16:09.902
that they've ever had to
a real home or-or a family.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.773
Which is why I hope that, um,

16:13.806 --> 16:17.310
our history doesn't...

16:17.344 --> 16:19.279
prevent you from seeing that.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.981
Wow.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.251
No. Uh, what I'm trying
to say is...

16:24.284 --> 16:27.754
Is that after all these years,
I'm still so devastated,

16:27.787 --> 16:30.857
I can't think
with my rational mind?

16:34.961 --> 16:37.697
I just want to make sure
that we get a fair shake.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.266
That's all.

16:39.299 --> 16:42.502
If your kids are living healthy,
happy lives,

16:42.535 --> 16:44.637
then you've got nothing
to worry about.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.206
Okay?

16:48.175 --> 16:50.143
Fair enough.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.782
(normal voice):
Why is it doing this to me?

16:55.815 --> 16:58.151
Sometimes there's no reason.

16:58.185 --> 17:01.354
Sometimes they just want to hurt
something that's good and pure.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.955
He told me...

17:02.989 --> 17:06.859
(crying): He said he could
bring my baby back.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.262
That I could hold her
one more time.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.432
Yeah, that's what they do.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.502
They find the thing that
your heart wants most,

17:15.535 --> 17:18.705
and... and they dangle it
in front of your nose.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.807
But it's a lie.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.375
(groans)

17:22.409 --> 17:24.677
Shh.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.746
Talk to me, Cindy.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.048
Tell me about your husband.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.717
-Jordy.
-Yeah.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.452
Tell me about Jordy.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.020
First time you ever met.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.888
He was, uh...

17:35.922 --> 17:38.558
He was starting fullback.

17:38.591 --> 17:42.662
(panting): And the only freshman
to make varsity.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.632
-Bet you were a cheerleader.
-Mm-mm.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.501
I was too shy.

17:48.535 --> 17:52.272
He took me to a senior party
at Dalton's Lake.

17:52.305 --> 17:55.041
I got so drunk...

17:55.074 --> 17:58.945
I tried to jump the bonfire,
(chuckles)

17:58.978 --> 18:01.548
-and broke my ankle.
-Oh.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.416
Jordy had to carry me home.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.553
-Romantic.
-(both chuckle)

18:06.586 --> 18:09.922
You got someone, Father?

18:11.591 --> 18:16.129
No. I'm a priest, darling.

18:16.163 --> 18:19.799
-Married to the man upstairs.
-Mmm.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.270
But you're not a priest,
are you?

18:24.837 --> 18:28.074
(demonic voice):
They took your collar from you.

18:28.107 --> 18:32.912
Took your last excuse
for being alone.

18:34.714 --> 18:38.385
"Find the thing your heart
wants most."

18:38.418 --> 18:42.222
What does your heart want most,

18:42.255 --> 18:44.591
Man of God?

18:44.624 --> 18:48.695
Oh, God abandoned you.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.931
You're nothing
but an empty vessel.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.234
MARCUS:
"Therefore,

18:54.267 --> 18:56.903
"since we have been justified
through faith,

18:56.936 --> 19:00.440
we find peace with God through
our Lord Jesus Christ."

19:00.473 --> 19:02.875
Why do you bother praying
when you know

19:02.909 --> 19:04.644
He's not listening to you?

19:04.677 --> 19:07.614
"Not only so,

19:07.647 --> 19:10.783
but we also glory
in our sufferings."

19:10.817 --> 19:12.285
You think your friend won't
discard you, too?

19:12.319 --> 19:14.287
"We glory in our sufferings."

19:14.321 --> 19:16.055
Father Tomas...

19:16.088 --> 19:18.157
-God's new favorite.
-"We glory in our sufferings.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.227
We glory in our sufferings."

19:20.260 --> 19:22.762
-He doesn't need you.
-I glory in my sufferings,

19:22.795 --> 19:24.764
-because my suffering
produces perseverance. -Suffer.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.666
-"Since we have been
justified..." -You need Him

19:26.699 --> 19:28.901
so your wasted life has purpose.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.003
"...through our Lord
Jesus Christ.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.172
"We glory in our sufferings,

19:33.206 --> 19:36.509
"because we know our suffering
produces perseverance.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.679
-(laughing)
-We glory in our sufferings!"

19:39.712 --> 19:42.482
SHELBY: Be present
at our table, Oh, Lord.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.317
VERITY:
Oh, flying spaghetti monster.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.952
SHELBY:
These mercies bless us,

19:45.985 --> 19:48.355
and grant that we may feast
in fellowship with Thee.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.657
And be touched by his
noodly appendage.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.124
SHELBY:
Oh, Lord, please forgive

19:52.158 --> 19:55.194
-and love us all, even Verity.
-(Truck chuckles)

19:55.228 --> 19:58.197
-Amen. -TRUCK: Amen.
-ANDY: Amen. -Ramen.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.500
Thanks for having me, guys.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.635
-Can I have your cornbread,
Caleb? -Five dollars.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.037
-TRUCK: Come on. Please?
-So, Rose.

20:05.071 --> 20:08.408
This is, like, your whole job?

20:08.441 --> 20:10.543
Going around spying
on foster homes?

20:10.577 --> 20:11.911
V.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.381
What? You said,
"make conversation."

20:14.414 --> 20:16.716
Yeah. I, um, I visit homes.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.719
I see how the kids are doing,
and I make sure

20:19.752 --> 20:23.790
that they are in the best
possible environment.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.726
VERITY: AKA, look for reasons
to stick the freaks

20:26.759 --> 20:28.261
back in the freak show?

20:29.396 --> 20:31.163
(quietly):
Don't be an ass, Verity.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.399
Language, God boy.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.968
I didn't do it.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.505
I look for kids living in abuse,

20:38.538 --> 20:41.474
neglect, poverty, addiction...

20:41.508 --> 20:44.176
Basically anyone who needs
someone to stand up for them.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.779
Until we turn 18,

20:46.813 --> 20:49.215
at which point you throw us
out on the streets.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.551
-Someone else's problem.
-Verity, that's enough.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.354
Andy doesn't like it when I talk
about the whole homeless thing.

20:54.387 --> 20:57.424
Probably because I only have
three months left to go.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.091
Ticktock.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.530
So, you know my dad?

21:05.064 --> 21:07.266
-I, uh...
-It's a big system, Caleb.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.936
He lives in Dallas, and
he's getting his license back.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.439
And when he does,
I'm gonna live with him.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.073
I'm gonna have my own room,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.443
and he has a pool
on top of his roof.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.581
What?

21:26.719 --> 21:28.655
Uh, your dad didn't show up

21:28.688 --> 21:30.957
for his custody hearing
this morning.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.560
-What does that mean?
-Well, it means,

21:33.593 --> 21:36.329
at this point, custody's looking
pretty unlikely, buddy.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.969
Maybe he just forgot.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.304
-(pounds table)
-CALEB: He didn't forget.

21:45.338 --> 21:48.140
He just doesn't want to deal
with a blind kid.

21:48.174 --> 21:49.942
-You don't know that.
-Oh, yeah?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.378
I called him on my birthday,

21:51.411 --> 21:53.279
and he said I'm a lot of work.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.015
Well, you are kind of
a lot of work.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.653
I happen to love that work.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.589
And if this means
you get to hang out with us

22:02.622 --> 22:03.856
for a little while longer,
then, uh,

22:03.890 --> 22:06.559
I feel pretty lucky.

22:06.593 --> 22:08.828
'Cause I think you're awesome.

22:10.196 --> 22:13.332
I mean, you're okay.

22:13.366 --> 22:15.001
ANDY:
Thank you, Shelby.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.343
Let's eat.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.188
(mutters softly)

22:52.539 --> 22:54.040
Hey.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.274
Hey, Pablo.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.744
Got any I.D. on you?

22:57.777 --> 22:59.378
I am paying cash.

22:59.412 --> 23:01.881
No I.D., no sale.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.483
(sighs)

23:07.420 --> 23:10.156
Chicago.
That's a long ways from home.

23:10.189 --> 23:12.525
-Yeah, I miss it.
-(cash register beeps)

23:12.559 --> 23:14.827
There you go.

23:14.861 --> 23:18.665
-Gracias.
-Yeah. Amigo.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.066
-Just six?
-For now.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.367
All right.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.902
-(phone beeps)
-(engine starts)

23:22.935 --> 23:24.571
Later.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.944
(insects chirping)

23:49.462 --> 23:50.963
(distorted music playing)

23:59.606 --> 24:01.974
(distorted music continues)

24:13.085 --> 24:15.121
(record spinning)

24:22.394 --> 24:24.363
(music playing normally)

24:24.396 --> 24:28.668
* For tears, honey,
it's too late *

24:28.701 --> 24:31.403
* Too late to cry

24:31.437 --> 24:36.108
* Oh, but it's too late

24:36.142 --> 24:38.911
* Oh, for begging me, baby.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.750
(keyboard clicking)

25:06.505 --> 25:08.808
Hmm.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.009
Grace.

25:10.042 --> 25:13.212
I heard a noise.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.615
Okay, then.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.016
Okay.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.118
What are you doing?

25:19.151 --> 25:21.353
ANDY: Putting you
back to bed. Come on.

25:21.387 --> 25:23.189
(grunting):
Ooh!

25:23.222 --> 25:25.124
There we go.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.328
(door creaks)

25:31.330 --> 25:33.332
(rustling)

25:34.567 --> 25:36.569
(labored breathing)

25:49.515 --> 25:51.517
(labored breathing continues)

25:57.223 --> 25:59.258
I'm sorry,
I think woke him up.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.693
ANDY:
It's a spectrum thing.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.630
He just needs to be touched.
Truck.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.297
(gasping)

26:05.331 --> 26:07.566
(quietly):
It's okay. I got you.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.369
Does he sleepwalk a lot?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.905
Usually when he's stressed.

26:14.440 --> 26:17.076
Like when there's
a stranger in the house?

26:19.779 --> 26:21.347
ANDY:
Come on, buddy.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.082
Let's get you bed. Come here.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.751
(Truck wheezes)

26:26.953 --> 26:28.955
Come on.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.061
(door closes)

26:37.997 --> 26:39.699
She's resting again.

26:39.732 --> 26:43.469
Then we should get started.

26:43.502 --> 26:46.739
TOMAS:
What? What's wrong?

26:46.773 --> 26:48.407
MARCUS: When you blacked out
in the truck,

26:48.440 --> 26:49.842
I know where you went.

26:49.876 --> 26:53.746
You can't battle
the demon inside.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.083
Once you let that thing
in your head,

26:57.116 --> 26:58.417
you're giving it access
to your hopes,

26:58.450 --> 27:00.619
your fears,
your darkest secrets.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.454
I know that.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.490
Do you?

27:09.428 --> 27:11.030
I spoke with her.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.699
I spoke with Cindy.

27:12.732 --> 27:15.267
She's in there, calling out,
asking for help.

27:15.301 --> 27:19.605
And I think...
I think I can go to her.

27:19.638 --> 27:24.076
There is a reason
we don't engage with the enemy.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.644
-Because it's dangerous.
-Because you're risking

27:25.678 --> 27:28.014
your immortal soul.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.382
Isn't that what we do?

27:30.416 --> 27:32.318
Why are you drawing a line here?

27:32.351 --> 27:34.520
This could be the key
to saving her.

27:34.553 --> 27:38.124
If we find a way in, we find
a way to drive the demon out.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.060
We drive it out by being present
in the real world.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.661
With ritual and repetition,

27:42.695 --> 27:44.196
the way it's been done
for hundreds of years.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.497
What if there's a better way?

27:45.531 --> 27:48.367
As priests, we are vessels.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.202
If you close the door
to the demon,

27:50.236 --> 27:51.738
aren't you closing
the door on God?

27:51.771 --> 27:53.539
It doesn't work that way, Tomas.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.144
You said we couldn't
save Angela.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.981
I brought her back.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.683
You think this is a gift?

28:04.717 --> 28:06.052
From God?

28:06.085 --> 28:07.619
Of course it is.

28:07.653 --> 28:09.021
(whispers):
What if you're wrong?

28:09.055 --> 28:11.457
"With pride comes disgrace."

28:11.490 --> 28:13.793
(growls)

28:13.826 --> 28:15.294
"But with humility
comes wisdom."

28:15.327 --> 28:17.329
Proverbs 11:2.

28:20.566 --> 28:24.536
Six months, and you still
treat me like a schoolboy.

28:24.570 --> 28:27.073
(chain rattling)

28:27.106 --> 28:30.509
-You don't need me.
-(Cindy growling)

28:30.542 --> 28:32.845
-I-I didn't mean to say...
-Fair enough.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.881
(growling softly)

28:38.951 --> 28:40.953
Let's get back to work.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.162
ANDY:
Almost there.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.898
You're doing great, pal.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.966
All right, we made it.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.002
We made it.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.309
Where's Caleb?

29:03.342 --> 29:04.844
Caleb?

29:04.877 --> 29:07.346
Caleb.

29:07.379 --> 29:08.881
-(knocks on door)
-Hey, Caleb.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.817
(static crackling)

29:10.850 --> 29:13.485
-Caleb?
-ROSE: Andy.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.893
Stay with Truck.

29:20.927 --> 29:24.163
Caleb? Caleb!

29:40.012 --> 29:41.647
(demonic growling)

29:48.620 --> 29:49.989
-TOMAS: By all that is holy...
-MARCUS: By all that is holy

29:50.022 --> 29:51.357
in the name of God.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.059
-(Cindy growling)
-(chains rattling)

29:53.092 --> 29:54.760
TOMAS AND MARCUS:
Your words will be acquitted!

29:54.793 --> 29:57.529
MARCUS:
Your words will be condemned!

29:57.563 --> 29:58.998
-In the name of God!
-We drive you from us!

29:59.031 --> 30:01.367
-Whoever you may be!
-Unclean spirits!

30:01.400 --> 30:03.235
-Whoever you may be! -Unclean
spirits!

30:03.269 --> 30:05.771
-We drive you from us!
-(growling)

30:05.804 --> 30:07.874
Unclean spirits!

30:07.907 --> 30:10.009
-TOMAS: In the name of God!
-We pray! -(banging on door)

30:10.042 --> 30:11.177
JORDY:
Open the door!

30:11.210 --> 30:13.512
Open up or I'll kick it in!

30:13.545 --> 30:15.247
-Keep going. I'll buy us
some time. -No, no, no, no.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.615
It's me--
the one that should go.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.749
You don't need me.

30:17.783 --> 30:19.085
You can finish this, Tomas.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.186
Just be careful.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.154
(growling)

30:24.790 --> 30:27.126
(growling)

30:28.928 --> 30:31.864
We drive you from us, whoever
you may be, unclean spirit.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.866
-In the name of God!
-(growling)

30:35.601 --> 30:36.835
-I'll call the cops.
-They're an hour away

30:36.869 --> 30:38.770
on the mainland.
There's no time.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.106
Okay. Go. Hurry.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.442
-V, V, wait.
-Verity.

30:43.475 --> 30:44.977
Nope. You just got here.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.478
I'm not gonna let you
tell me what to do.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.646
That's my brother out there.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.780
And we're gonna find him.

30:48.814 --> 30:49.882
But you're not going alone.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.150
Shelby, go with her.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.252
Truck, you're with me.

31:02.128 --> 31:04.096
Caleb?

31:06.665 --> 31:10.669
Caleb? Caleb?

31:21.713 --> 31:24.083
(wet squishing)

31:34.360 --> 31:36.428
Caleb.

31:36.462 --> 31:39.031
SHELBY (quietly): Please,
lend us strength tonight.

31:39.065 --> 31:42.568
Guide us with your mercy
and your graces.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.003
What are you doing?

31:44.036 --> 31:46.405
I'm praying.

31:46.438 --> 31:47.806
Super helpful.

31:47.839 --> 31:50.342
Hey, maybe God knows
where Caleb went.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.511
You should totally ask him.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.013
It doesn't work like that.

31:54.046 --> 31:57.349
Then how does it work? Huh?

31:57.383 --> 32:00.219
What good is a God
that never shows up,

32:00.252 --> 32:01.887
that can't even protect
one little kid?

32:04.957 --> 32:06.392
We're gonna find him, V.

32:08.427 --> 32:12.764
Caleb. Caleb!

32:18.137 --> 32:20.239
TOMAS (faintly):
We drive you from us,

32:20.272 --> 32:22.774
-whoever you may be, unclean
spirit. -(Jordy grunting)

32:22.808 --> 32:24.943
Can I help you with something?

32:24.977 --> 32:27.446
TOMAS (faintly):
In the name of God!

32:27.479 --> 32:29.215
JORDY:
Unlock that door.

32:29.248 --> 32:32.484
I know what this looks like,
but we didn't kidnap anyone.

32:32.518 --> 32:35.787
-(growling) -Your wife
is a very sick woman.

32:35.821 --> 32:37.956
She's grieving.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.925
She lost a child.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.161
She needs to be home
with family.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.263
She went to the Church

32:44.296 --> 32:46.465
'cause some part of her
knew what was happening.

32:46.498 --> 32:47.899
JORDY:
We went to the Church

32:47.933 --> 32:49.201
and they said no.

32:49.235 --> 32:50.636
So, who the hell are you, huh?

32:50.669 --> 32:53.305
The ones who don't say no.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.407
She's in grave danger, Jordy.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.010
As we speak, she's halfway down
the gullet of a creature

32:58.044 --> 33:00.279
you can't even begin
to understand.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.982
And right now,
my friend is the only thing

33:04.016 --> 33:05.917
keeping that presence at bay.

33:05.951 --> 33:09.821
We drive you from us, whoever
you may be, unclean spirit.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.290
In the name of God!

33:11.323 --> 33:13.125
(roaring)

33:13.159 --> 33:15.927
For there is no other God
than you,

33:15.961 --> 33:17.629
nor can there be
another true God beside you.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.265
(moans)

33:19.298 --> 33:21.900
-(normal voice): Father Tomas,
help me. -God commands you!

33:25.204 --> 33:27.039
(train whistle blowing
in distance)

33:29.541 --> 33:31.543
(growling)

33:31.577 --> 33:35.047
Deliver this servant of yours
from unclean spirits!

33:36.848 --> 33:38.384
(train whistle blowing)

33:38.417 --> 33:40.086
(shudders)

33:40.119 --> 33:41.653
Please.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.356
It's choking me.

33:45.991 --> 33:48.394
(Cindy choking)

33:59.004 --> 34:00.839
(Marcus grunts, coughs)

34:00.872 --> 34:03.975
GREG: Why don't you just do
as the man says and let us in?

34:04.009 --> 34:05.944
You think I like this?
Hitting a priest?

34:05.977 --> 34:07.946
(panting)

34:11.917 --> 34:14.052
I'm not a priest.

34:14.086 --> 34:16.755
(snorts, spits)

34:29.735 --> 34:32.404
(grunting)

34:38.910 --> 34:41.213
I'm not afraid of you!

34:45.117 --> 34:47.453
Show yourself to me.

34:47.486 --> 34:50.055
(growling softly)

34:56.762 --> 34:58.297
(grunting)

and knock.

35:10.976 --> 35:13.879
"If anyone hears My voice
and opens the door,

35:13.912 --> 35:16.948
I will come into him, and dine
with him and he with Me."

35:44.676 --> 35:46.612
(doors creak)

35:59.191 --> 36:01.193
Caleb?

(boards creaking)

36:07.199 --> 36:08.667
-Don't you move.
-CALEB: One...

Hold on.

36:50.342 --> 36:52.644
Okay. You all right?

36:52.678 --> 36:54.313
Are you hurt? Wait, Caleb.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.481
You all right?

36:55.514 --> 36:57.316
What were you doing out here?

36:59.885 --> 37:01.320
A-Andy?

37:01.353 --> 37:03.489
Yes.

37:05.524 --> 37:06.892
It's me, Andy.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.660
We're gonna get you home.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.028
We're gonna get you into bed.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.563
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

37:11.597 --> 37:13.231
Okay?

* Along the highway...

Cindy.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.554
* Of sayin'...

38:42.588 --> 38:44.055
Cindy, can you hear me?

38:44.089 --> 38:46.458
* I'm always walkin'...

* After...

39:29.735 --> 39:31.369
Sorry, gents.
