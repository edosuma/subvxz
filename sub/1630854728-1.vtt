00:52.791 --> 00:57.013
♪ In the city, of LA

01:05.282 --> 01:07.067

01:10.983 --> 01:13.247
I know for most people,

01:13.290 --> 01:15.423
a house party
is just a kick-back
to catch up with the homies.

01:15.466 --> 01:19.122
But this is LA,
a city where a party
can change your life.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.734
A place where legends
are born, die,
and live again.

01:22.778 --> 01:27.348
And bein' rich or bein' broke
can be separated
by a mere freeway.

01:27.391 --> 01:30.394
But once in a great while,
the stars align,

01:30.438 --> 01:33.615
and the Fates bless
a few fortunate dreamers
with a night that will change

01:33.658 --> 01:36.357
the course
of their lives forever.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.924
In other words,
there's some crazy, beautiful,

01:38.968 --> 01:40.796
weird-ass shit
about to go down.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.151
One and two
and three and four.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.065
The fuck?

02:12.915 --> 02:15.396
Destiny, what you think?

02:15.439 --> 02:18.529
I know it sound weird,
but let's see
what Daddy cooked up.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.849
This beat feel good!
It feel free!

02:33.892 --> 02:35.981
I'm the goat!

02:36.025 --> 02:39.507
Sellin' out stadiums!
Platinum records!

02:39.550 --> 02:41.378
Yeah, that's my baby
on the track.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.119
You hear that? That's you.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.040
Yo, come on.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.868
Look who decided
to wake up.

02:52.911 --> 02:55.349
Did you sign the start forms
for the IT job yet?

02:55.392 --> 02:57.351
I'mma get on that Monday.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.396
You ain't got all the time
in the world
because in three months,

02:59.440 --> 03:02.225
your mother and I will be
enjoyin' our retirement.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.795
Spoonin' each other
on the sandy beaches
of Daytona, Florida.

03:06.838 --> 03:11.060
And this house will be sold,
so... did you find
anywhere to live yet?

03:11.103 --> 03:14.063
Once I start my new job,
I'll have the money
to get a new place.

03:14.106 --> 03:16.935
I mean, you could just
lend me the money.

03:16.979 --> 03:19.242
Yeah, right.

03:19.286 --> 03:22.245
When I was raised,
you think anybody was just
goin' around giving me money?

03:22.289 --> 03:24.639
You don't know what
it was like in LA in the '90s.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.554
Don't let this house fool you.

03:26.597 --> 03:29.034
Half this shit we got
in the riots, right baby?

03:30.122 --> 03:31.950
You ain't lyin'.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.605
I said, "lend," Pop. Dang.

03:34.649 --> 03:37.260
Oh, I saw Mrs. Bailey
at Vons yesterday.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.522
How is Venus doing?

03:38.566 --> 03:40.176
Good, I guess.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.699
I mean, I think she live near
Leimert Park, now.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.571
You two were like twins
in middle school.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.355
-Remember that?
-No, I don't remember that.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.183
I thought you two might
have been datin'

03:47.227 --> 03:49.707
until she went to prom
with that football player.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.448
I follow him on Facebook, too.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.842
He is more handsome
now than ever.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.326
You don't ever talk
to Venus at work?

03:59.369 --> 04:01.676
Not really. She work
in the main office.

04:01.719 --> 04:05.027
I see her when I'm dropping off
keys to a house or...
picking up my check.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.334
That was nice of her
to help you get that job.

04:07.377 --> 04:10.946
But stupid of you
to help Damon get his.

04:10.989 --> 04:14.602
Jesus is my friend.
Yeah, he's my friend.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.346
Damon!

04:19.389 --> 04:22.174
Damon, wake your lazy ass up.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.135
Damon! I know you
gotta work today.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.833
And clean up this room, too.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.096
It smell like ass
and onions in here.

04:34.404 --> 04:35.927
-Damon!

04:35.971 --> 04:39.931
All right, I'm up already, man.
Damn. Jeez.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.804
That's what you get,
stayin' out partyin' all night.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.589
Mm-hmm. You think you can live
playing pick-up basketball

04:45.633 --> 04:47.809
and clubbing
and fucking up my house?

04:47.852 --> 04:49.898
See now I know why
your mama kicked your ass out.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.856
Aunt Jean, for the last time,
all right...

04:52.901 --> 04:54.337
It's not clubbing.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.861
I'm a promoter.
I'm working, all right?

04:56.905 --> 04:59.386
People followin' me
on Instagram
and comin' to my parties.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.126
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.825
-Did you make any money?
-There she go.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.609
Oh, I get it.
It's a non-profit.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.698
You're doing charity work.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.614
Boy, if you're in a club
and not making any money,
then it's clubbin'.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.268
You must think I'm stupid.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.662
Don't forget, you owe me rent,
plus last month's.

05:14.705 --> 05:17.317
'Cause next stop is gonna
be Skid Row for you.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.666
Talkin' about followers.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.145
You know who got followers?

05:20.189 --> 05:21.538
Jesus.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.279
Mm-hmm.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.194
Take your rude ass to work,
and clean up that room.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.197
Smell like somebody
fucked an onion.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.155
Oh, my God, Aunt Jean,
you just cursed.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.243
What would Jesus say?

05:32.070 --> 05:33.681
Jesus would say,
"Shut the fuck up,
this is my house!"

05:33.724 --> 05:34.682
Man!

05:40.122 --> 05:41.166
Hey, beautiful.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.084
Don't make me
get my gun.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.390
Oh, shit.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.827
Let's get you
to your mom's house.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.787
See, what Granny and Paw-Paw
don't know is...

05:52.830 --> 05:55.529
Is that I'm about to make a lot
of money from this party.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.619
And we gonna
have everything we need.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.403
Have all the toys you need.

06:00.447 --> 06:01.273
-Hey!

06:03.711 --> 06:05.669
Hey, what's going on?
What y'all doin'--

06:05.713 --> 06:08.063
-Where Damon at?
-I don't know.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.891
Y'all know
he doesn't live here.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.414
We gonna burn
his nigga house down.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.459
-Larry, chill.
-Whoa. What?

06:12.502 --> 06:14.243
I got my daughter with me.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.419
I tried to call y'all twice
this week about the party.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.638
Y'all ain't returning my calls.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.422
Y'all dickheads off the party.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.816
-Guile? I got this.
-Hmm.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.208
-Okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.167
'Cause y'all dickheads
off the party.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.777
Yeah, I heard him. But why?

06:26.821 --> 06:27.909
You know exactly why!

06:27.952 --> 06:29.476
We're gonna make you pay.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.608
-First we gonna
tie you up, right?
-Mm-hmm.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.131
Then we'll cut your little
nappy head off

06:33.175 --> 06:34.872
-with a rusty machete.
-Whoa.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.309
-Yeah.
-Then I'm gonna sew
your booty hole up.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.616
I'm gonna take some
Mexican candy, the spicy kind.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.358
Then I'm gonna shove it
down your throat
till you're nice and plump.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.708
And then I'm gonna
beat your ass like a pinata.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.754
Larry-- Larry,
let's just calm down.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.452
Hey. Hey. I need you
to really work on dialing
back your threats.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.454
-Dial it back?
-You put too much sauce on it!

06:51.498 --> 06:53.500
-Too much sau--
-What you mean, too much--
A pinata?

06:53.543 --> 06:55.066
Y'all off the party!

06:55.110 --> 06:56.720
You and that little weirdo Vic,
and that's that!

06:56.764 --> 06:59.288
Y'all can't do that, man.
We got money invested.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.290
You can thank
your home boy, Damon.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.423
Never liked that
roach-face-ass nigga, anyway.

07:03.466 --> 07:06.208
Yeah, he tried to play
my baby cousin,
tried to get away with it?

07:06.251 --> 07:07.644
And steal from her?

07:07.688 --> 07:09.733
What you mean?
He stole from her?

07:09.777 --> 07:11.866
Daisy can't find
her gold necklace.

07:11.909 --> 07:15.304
And I know that little
crackhead-ass boy
Damon took it.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.219
We're gonna
fuck his ass up on sight.

07:17.262 --> 07:19.743
-On sight, boy.
-Yeah. That's right.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.920
Then we gonna grind
his dick into a juice.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.096
Make him drink that shit.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.492
-Okay, no, no.
-What's left over,
that's for you.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.363
We just talked about you
dialin' this back.

07:31.407 --> 07:32.713
-What did I do?
-We're not juicin'
no dicks today!

07:32.756 --> 07:34.062
You know what? I quit!

07:34.105 --> 07:36.064
-Oh, you quit?
-I quit! Do it yourself!

07:36.107 --> 07:38.370
-You did this same shit
in the third grade.
-So?

07:38.414 --> 07:40.503
Just get the fuck
outta here, man!

07:40.547 --> 07:41.548
-Guile!
-Huh?

07:43.332 --> 07:44.289
I got this!

07:45.421 --> 07:46.814
Between the both-- Why--

07:47.684 --> 07:48.642
I got it.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.517
Get the fuck outta here.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.519
Get yo' ass in the back.
What you doin'?

07:56.563 --> 07:57.520
I thought you quit.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.567
You got short legs.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.100
You interrupt me
one more time,
I keep tellin' you.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.885
-Every time I speak,
you wanna speak.

08:14.929 --> 08:15.886
-Quit speakin'!

08:23.154 --> 08:26.767
Hey. What's up with it, y'all?
It's your boy, DamonThaDon.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.030
Just wanna hit y'all with a bit
of morning motivation.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.945
Lot of people trying
to stress you out.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.295
But don't let the bullshit
get to you, all right?

08:33.338 --> 08:35.036
Do whatever it is
that makes you happy.

08:35.079 --> 08:37.734
Smoke a little weed,
a little meditation.

08:37.778 --> 08:38.866
Maybe a party.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.218
Y'all know we got
a big one comin' up,
so, make sure y'all pull up.

08:43.261 --> 08:46.700
Until then... it's regular.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.266
Damon!

08:48.310 --> 08:51.313
Damn, man! Always hating.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.229
Here I come! Fuck.

09:02.498 --> 09:05.719
Hey, Armen.
Sorry I'm late, man.
The 405 crazy.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.547
Somebody famous live here?

09:07.590 --> 09:10.680
Jesus, I'm so glad I won't
have to deal with you anymore.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.030
These areas
are marked and locked.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.858
They are not to be
tampered with.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.557
Kevin will return the keys
when you're done.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.080
He's the responsible one.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.168
Man.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.213
I have another site to get to.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.436
Bye, Damon.

09:27.479 --> 09:30.657
It's Damon, bro.
The French way.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.397
Stupid.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.356
Shit ain't that hard.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.967
Damn, man, this how
the other half live, huh.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.545
Hey!

09:49.589 --> 09:52.330
God damn, man.
I see you late as usual.

09:52.374 --> 09:54.637
Yeah, you know, I got caught up
in the clubhouse,

09:54.681 --> 09:56.117
schoolin' niggas
on how to be successful

09:56.160 --> 09:57.553
and not have to work
a basic job.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.863
Hey, how's my
goddaughter, Destiny?

10:02.906 --> 10:04.560
She fine.
She's at her mom's house.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.562
Man, Armen was acting
weird as hell, bro.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.521
Actin' hella sketchy
about who's crib this is.

10:09.565 --> 10:12.046
I guess you ain't heard
we got kicked off
the party tomorrow.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.613
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

10:13.656 --> 10:15.223
Kyle and them is pissed.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.877
They don't like you doggin'
their cousin Daisy.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.183
Daisy? Light-skinned Daisy?

10:19.227 --> 10:20.707
That's they cousin?

10:20.750 --> 10:23.318
Shit. I'd be pissed, too.

10:23.361 --> 10:26.103
But they can't kick us
off the party, though, Kev.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.497
We put money in! I'm the host!

10:28.540 --> 10:30.630
I told you,
stop messing with that girl.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.675
She started liking me too much.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.765
That shit--
It just turn me off,
you feel me?

10:35.809 --> 10:38.159
I'm like, "You want me? Me?"

10:39.464 --> 10:40.944
I'm still in my ho phase, bro.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.554
Man, they said
you stole her chain.

10:42.598 --> 10:43.643
Man, that's cap!

10:44.382 --> 10:45.862
That's big cap!

10:45.906 --> 10:48.735
That's bottle cap!
That's Colin Kap!

10:48.778 --> 10:50.824
-That's Cap-tain America!
-Yo!

10:53.304 --> 10:56.960
Nobody want that fugazi
raggedy-ass swap meet
chain, anyway.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.179
Chain's not worth shit.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.054
Damn, that shit
just fluffed itself.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.709
Whose crib is this, man?
Steve Jobs?

11:06.753 --> 11:10.234
-Steve Jobs is dead, fool.
-Don't mean his house died.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.410
There goes
the money I invested.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.282
I got shit to pay for.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.327
Have to pick up
some extra shifts.

11:16.371 --> 11:17.633
That might not even be enough.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.939
I know, right?

11:18.982 --> 11:20.549
They payin' us Mexican
prices out here.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.421
Hey, my bad, Juan.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.075
-I'm Venezuelan.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.816
Hey, nobody said
you wasn't, Juan.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.776
Come on, let's knock
this house out.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.821
I ain't got all day.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.476
I gotta get home
in time to read to Destiny
and drop the keys off.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.217
Armen must think
you a slave, huh?

11:36.260 --> 11:38.175
He know better
not to try that shit with me.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.481
I'll knock his ass out.

11:46.662 --> 11:50.013
Hey, V. It's crazy you called.
My mom's--

11:50.057 --> 11:51.667
What the hell
is wrong with you?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.103
Oh, nothin', I'm good.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.235
Corporate is in there
right now,

11:54.278 --> 11:56.324
watching a video
of you and Damon

11:56.367 --> 11:58.718
smoking at the house
on Baylor Street.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.676
That don't even sound like us.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.983
This is serious, Kevin.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.246
They are short on staff today,
so, they're gonna let you
clean that last house,

12:05.289 --> 12:08.902
but you are getting
terminated officially,
first thing Monday morning.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.643
Maybe we can talk to 'em
and change their mind,
or somethin'.

12:11.687 --> 12:12.906
I need this job.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.909
These niggas fired.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.172
-No, y'all "fired" fired.
-Hey, Venus!

12:18.215 --> 12:19.782
I gotta go.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.916
Sorry. Sorry, Kev.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.918
Who was that?
Little girlfriend, Venus?

12:27.311 --> 12:29.313
Hey, bro, let's spark up.

12:31.489 --> 12:34.014
Why you standing there
like you shit yourself?

12:34.057 --> 12:35.624
-We fired.
-What?

12:39.976 --> 12:40.847
How?

12:56.210 --> 12:59.822
To be honest with you,
fuck this job.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.389
You're way too talented
for this, Kev.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.826
What you should do
is focus on them beats.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.873
The shit you sent me today,
now, that shit was hard.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.441
I ain't mean to mess up
your money, though, man.

13:11.486 --> 13:12.487
My bad, dawg.

13:14.576 --> 13:15.577
But you'll figure
this shit out.

13:16.491 --> 13:17.448
You always do.

13:19.494 --> 13:20.843
What if we threw a house party?

13:20.887 --> 13:24.499
Where? Auntie crib?

13:24.542 --> 13:28.155
I mean,
that shit could work, but...
she got these low-ass ceilings,

13:28.198 --> 13:31.201
and she got this cat
that be throwin' up
every time it smell weed, so...

13:31.245 --> 13:34.161
No, not like a regular house.

13:34.204 --> 13:38.600
People are tired of us throwin'
the same party. Every time.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.820
We need something... different.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.170
Something bigger.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.304
Something like this place.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.175
You trying to throw
a party here?

13:48.218 --> 13:49.524
Not here.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.353
-Armen would kill us, man.
-True.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.876
We could rent
something out like this.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.443
Rent? Oh, hell, no.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.532
That would be terrible
for our margins, dawg.

13:57.575 --> 14:01.101
Plus, my followers? Here? Shit.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.494
Niggas ain't got no respect
for a nice place like this.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.890
I don't know.
I gotta figure
something out, though.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.023
I need ten G's by next week.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.720
My parents
about to sell the house.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.418
If I don't pay for my
daughter's fancy preschool,

14:14.462 --> 14:17.334
Char could make a case
to get full custody,
and I ain't having that shit.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.553
Man, all right. All right.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.424
All right, man. Damn.

14:20.468 --> 14:24.515
You ain't gotta convince me.
I was in the moment you said...

14:24.559 --> 14:27.867
"Damon... please,
I need your help."

14:33.046 --> 14:35.222
-I didn't even say that.
-Man!

14:35.265 --> 14:38.486
I could hit up my fan base,
we could make 10,000
off cover charges, easy.

14:38.529 --> 14:41.315
All right.
Enough hypothesizing.
I'll call around.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.533
Let's get to work.

14:42.577 --> 14:45.145
Damn. This nigga love to work.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.364
Shit.

14:47.408 --> 14:50.280
Jab. Jab. Spin.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.416
Yeah, that ain't a travel.
That's good.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.200
Hey, Sabrina?

14:57.244 --> 14:59.420
Yeah, remember we threw
that Halloween party last year?

14:59.463 --> 15:03.728
Oh, look... I'm throwing
another party this weekend,
and I need a venue.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.999
Damn. This dude
got his own museum.

15:25.794 --> 15:28.362
Damn. She thick.

15:30.799 --> 15:31.669
Whew!

15:31.713 --> 15:32.714
I would.

15:37.414 --> 15:41.070
Dude got Miami shit,
Cleveland shit, LA shit.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.986
It's like, damn,
pick a city, bro.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.771
Man, you could actually
fuck in here, bro. Yeah.

15:47.294 --> 15:49.078
Yeah!

15:49.122 --> 15:50.427
Conforming to body.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.386
Yeah, this is nice.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.476
Oh! Ewe. What the fuck?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.446
Is this motherfucker a giant?

16:14.669 --> 16:15.713
Damn.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.802
Two weeks meditation?

16:17.846 --> 16:19.065
This dude gotta be stressed.

16:19.848 --> 16:20.762
Who is this bro?

16:37.344 --> 16:39.215
Buddy is on LeBron's nuts.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.849
Oh, my God.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.069
I know it's last minute,
but you gotta have something.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.028
Yes, sir!

17:09.071 --> 17:10.246
-Yeah, I understand.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.295
These promoters talking
a lot of shit about us.

17:15.338 --> 17:18.080
-We're being blackballed.
-Well, fuck all that, bro.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.690
Why is you still cleaning?

17:19.734 --> 17:21.040
Might as well get
this last check.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.303
Fuck that, Kev!

17:23.346 --> 17:24.739
What you doing, man?
They got cameras in here!

17:24.782 --> 17:26.697
Don't worry
about that shit, Kev.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.525
I found the camera room
and I turned all them
shits off.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.266
You forgot I worked
at Geek Squad, huh?

17:31.137 --> 17:32.312
Whose jacket you got on?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.270
Check it out.

17:36.446 --> 17:37.447
It's LeBron's.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.059
LeBron who?

17:42.235 --> 17:43.932
James, nigga!

17:43.975 --> 17:45.586
There is only
one LeBron on earth!

17:45.629 --> 17:47.762
Why you got on his clothes?

17:47.805 --> 17:51.070
'Cause this his house.

17:51.113 --> 17:54.116
Mmm. This him, Kev!
This him! This all him.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.337
This-- Man, look, man!
This is his candle.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.165
Smell like game time
in this motherfucker.

17:59.208 --> 18:02.603
Look, man, this is his--
This is his fridge, Kev! Look!

18:02.646 --> 18:03.604
This his juice.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.610
This juice is LeBron
juice, bro!

18:09.653 --> 18:12.134
Get some of this greatness
in your life, goddammit.

18:13.527 --> 18:14.658
You fucking
kidding me right now?

18:17.966 --> 18:20.055
Shut the fuck up.

18:21.361 --> 18:24.233
Yep. Told you.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.322
-Hey, there.
-Oh!

18:26.366 --> 18:29.630
You are one handsome,
philanthropic motherfucker.

18:29.673 --> 18:31.588
-Who, me?
-Your hairline is perfect.

18:31.632 --> 18:35.114
Anyone who says
otherwise is just jealous.

18:35.157 --> 18:39.553
Bro, he got
a hologram of himself,
just to give him compliments?

18:39.596 --> 18:41.816
Yeah, that do make
sense, though.

18:41.859 --> 18:45.602
The only person that could
convince him he the greatest...
is the greatest.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.039
You handled the decision
to go to Miami perfectly.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.432
Nah!

18:49.476 --> 18:52.305
That's cap. This guy.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.874
Damon. Stop touchin' shit, man.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.398
Man, what, man? Shut up, bro!

18:58.441 --> 18:59.660
Your scary ass, bro.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.357
Oh, Damn, I need a face ID.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.751
Shit.

19:03.794 --> 19:06.014
Hey,
talk, man.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.624
You were great inTrainwreck.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.365
In fact, Ian Crouch
of theNew Yorker

19:09.409 --> 19:12.020
said you were the funniest
person in the movie.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.938
Damn, we got all of LeBron's
contacts in here.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.679
Pretty much everybody
in the world.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.289
Man, shut up, bro.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.552
Even got Carole Baskin
in here, bro.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.295
Should we invite her
to our party?

19:29.124 --> 19:32.258
Yo! Yo.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.912
Yo! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo yo, Kev!

19:34.956 --> 19:35.826
Yo! Kev, yo!

19:35.870 --> 19:38.002
Yo, yo, yo. Yo! Yo!

19:38.046 --> 19:41.658
How about...
we throw the party... here?

19:41.702 --> 19:43.617
Bro, that
was a bad idea before.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.271
-It's a terrible idea now.
-What?

19:45.314 --> 19:48.622
Your NBA 2K rating
should be 100, not 97.

19:48.665 --> 19:50.145
Yeah.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.191
Come on, man.
It's the perfect idea, bro.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.105
Who wouldn't want to party
in the King's house?

19:54.149 --> 19:56.804
To become a champion,
you must think like a champion.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.675
Listen to LeBron, man!

19:58.719 --> 20:00.373
Look, it's perfect, dawg. Look.

20:00.416 --> 20:01.765
We just hit up
all his contacts.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.898
As LeBron's assistants.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.335
We say that LeBron
throwing a secret party
on some low key shit.

20:06.379 --> 20:09.512
You want to trick famous people
into thinking LeBron
throwing a party?

20:09.556 --> 20:10.600
In his own house?

20:10.644 --> 20:13.386
-Hell, yeah!
-Man.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.039
We can charge
way more at the door

20:15.083 --> 20:16.432
with these celebs
coming, all right?

20:16.476 --> 20:18.304
We can make
ten times the money, Kev.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.219
We can send
Destiny to preschool,

20:20.262 --> 20:23.134
high school,
college... Whatever.

20:23.178 --> 20:25.354
What about his family?
Somebody could show up.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.182
-We can go to jail.
-Your scary ass.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.097
You worried about
the wrong things, Kev.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.665
Look. Right here.
They on vacation.

20:31.708 --> 20:35.625
-He meditating for two weeks.
-Two weeks? Must be stressed.

20:35.669 --> 20:39.629
I would be, too if I was about
to hit my 30th season.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.284
Look, bro.
It's simple, all right?

20:42.328 --> 20:46.549
We could throw the party,
have it cleaned,
without him even knowing.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.159
Man, I don't know.

20:48.203 --> 20:50.031
Hey, hey, man. Hey, hey!

20:50.074 --> 20:51.424
This is not about us, Kev.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.296
It's not about you.
It's not about me.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.384
You know who it's about?

20:57.212 --> 21:00.215
Destiny. Lil' baby.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.696
She can't read.
She can't write.

21:02.739 --> 21:04.306
'Cause she can't go to school.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.917
-Why? Because you broke.
-Shut up.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.528
But you can change that, Kev.

21:08.571 --> 21:11.139
You could make it happen.
All right?

21:12.096 --> 21:14.098
Yeah, you see it.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.144
Now... are we doing this?

21:17.319 --> 21:18.538
Or are we doing this?

21:19.974 --> 21:22.846
Come on, now. Say yes.
Say yes, Kev.

21:22.890 --> 21:25.327
-This shit gotta be spotless.
-It's gonna be sparkling, bro.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.334
-Yeah...
-We doin' it.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.336
We doin' it. Yeah, my boy!

21:34.380 --> 21:36.382
You know what
that means, right?

21:36.425 --> 21:39.646
Looks like we about
to throw a house par--

21:39.689 --> 21:41.082
Excuse me.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.431
We're done in the living room.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.259
Oh. Okay, for sure.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.566
You can leave
the cleaning supplies
by the door.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.263
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.612
Dawg, you about to get--

21:49.656 --> 21:51.310
Which door? The one over here?

21:51.353 --> 21:52.833
Just the one over--

21:52.876 --> 21:54.225
Not that one,
the one right over--

21:54.269 --> 21:55.662
There's so many
doors in the house.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.490
Yo, Juan, get the fuck out
of here, bro!

21:57.533 --> 21:59.709
You ruining the special moment
between me and my man, bro.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.363
-Sorry.
-You and Gloria can leave.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.712
We'll lock up. Thanks, man.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.237
Yeah, come on, bro.

22:06.281 --> 22:09.719
Man, this is what we do, man.
We throw parties, bro.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.113
I'm gonna make some calls.
About to get it crackin'.

22:12.156 --> 22:13.462
Shit, I'mma call Diddy.

22:13.506 --> 22:16.335
Of course, Puffy,
Diddy, Sean, Mr. Love.

22:17.205 --> 22:19.642
Yeah. Ciroc only.

22:19.686 --> 22:22.776
We put the DJ booth right here,
VIP area upstairs.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.865
We can get Sly and Reg
to do security.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.041
Hell, yeah.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.825
We need somebody good
to clean this place
so we don't get caught.

22:28.869 --> 22:31.219
-We can do it.
-Naw, someone good.

22:32.307 --> 22:34.091
You right. You right.

22:35.745 --> 22:36.659
All right,
we're gonna tell
everybody no phones,

22:36.703 --> 22:38.357
no social media.

22:39.053 --> 22:41.708
The theme is for LeBron
and all the guests to play dumb
if it's ever brought up again.

22:41.751 --> 22:45.059
We're gonna call it,
"Off the Grid Part Two."

22:45.102 --> 22:46.452
"Off the Grid Part Two"?

22:46.495 --> 22:49.019
So, people think
they missed the first one.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.587
People would love
to have Dr. Dre
on the ones and twos.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.418
Oh! This is
Dr. Andre Liebowitz?

22:57.550 --> 22:58.638
Oh, my bad. My bad.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.076
No, I do not need
a hair transplant.

23:07.124 --> 23:08.212
Oh, my God.

23:17.744 --> 23:20.442
Then we invite
all the celebrities
and regular people too,

23:20.486 --> 23:22.444
and charge them more.

23:22.488 --> 23:26.274
Man, we about to be
the biggest promoters in town.

23:28.494 --> 23:29.451
Blanket.

23:43.770 --> 23:46.033
Popcorn.

23:46.076 --> 23:49.689
Bro. You really think LeBron's
installing popcorn
in his goddamn cinema--

24:12.799 --> 24:14.844
-Hey, yo.
-Yeah?

24:14.888 --> 24:16.890
I think we'll be good
if we keep the party
to the living room.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.761
Everything else is off limits.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.546
Yeah, we can
just party-proof it

24:20.589 --> 24:22.678
like we did that Pajama Jam
we threw at my granny house.

24:22.722 --> 24:25.202
Exactly. Plus,
all the good stuff is packed

24:25.246 --> 24:26.726
into the restricted areas,
anyway.

24:26.769 --> 24:30.164
Word. Nigga, this shit
about to be crackin'.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.514
I'm talking about legendary.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.255
I even booked us
some performers, too.

24:35.735 --> 24:37.432
-Who?
-Migos!

24:38.955 --> 24:40.391
How the hell you do that?

24:40.435 --> 24:41.697
Told Quavo he can play
LeBron one on one.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.830
-He believed it?
-Of course not.

24:43.873 --> 24:45.919
But he said he coming.

24:45.962 --> 24:49.009
Shit, I was thinking
he could freestyle
over one of your beats.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.534
Nah, man,
I'm still uncomfortable

24:52.578 --> 24:54.231
playin' my shit
after what happened.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.457
This the one?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.677
Hey, nigga.
Turn this weak-ass shit off.

25:04.720 --> 25:05.852
I got a customer out here.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.943
Yo, this shit
really is trash, bro.

25:09.986 --> 25:11.553
Fuckin' weirdos.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.643
Can't lowride to this, nigga.
This ain't Dre.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.384
You gotta get over that, bro.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.560
Dude was recording in the back
of a cell phone shop.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.910
No, I still don't
want to do it, though.

25:20.954 --> 25:21.998
That shit fucked me up.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.958
All right, whatever, bro.

25:25.001 --> 25:28.004
Look... I'm gonna drop
a fake set of keys off
to the office now.

25:28.048 --> 25:31.094
And I'm gonna give Venus
the real set, after the party.

25:31.138 --> 25:34.271
Man, we about to be kings
in the King's castle, dawg.

25:34.315 --> 25:35.142
Poof!

25:38.319 --> 25:39.233
Mm-hmm.

25:40.495 --> 25:41.888
We got a lot to do.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.281
All right.
Focus on the important stuff.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.981
Yo! What the fuck?

25:48.024 --> 25:51.114
My fault, bro. Shit. Damn.

25:51.158 --> 25:52.812
Keep your feet off my damn car.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.509
Come on, Kev.
Let's get to work.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.119
Start with the back yard.

26:04.650 --> 26:05.955
♪ Oh, God...

26:11.352 --> 26:13.310
Yup. It's that rapper weed.

26:15.269 --> 26:16.357
Baby lungs.

26:17.532 --> 26:20.361
-Oh!
-Yo!

26:20.404 --> 26:22.450
-What the fuck was that?
-Looked like a koala.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.017
-A what?
-Yeah, a koala.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.627
-You never seen a koala before?
-Hell no, man.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.063
That looked like
a fucked-up monkey.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.065
Yo, Kev. Let's go inside.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.024
Because if it come over,
I'mma kick the shit out of it.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.503
Come on, man. Get off me.

26:32.547 --> 26:33.548
You're scared of a teddy bear?

26:36.203 --> 26:39.119
Yo, what the fuck is that?
You leave the gate open?

26:39.162 --> 26:40.729
Nigga, I don't know,
it's not my house.

26:43.384 --> 26:44.907
Kev, come here. Hey.
-Hello?

26:44.951 --> 26:46.430
Come here, Kev.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.302
-Hello?
-Wait.

26:48.345 --> 26:50.652
Hi! I see you there.
How are you?

26:51.871 --> 26:52.785
I already saw you.

26:53.568 --> 26:54.830
-It's a white man.
-Oh, shit!

26:54.874 --> 26:56.527
Oh, shit!

26:56.571 --> 26:58.617
We going to jail, Kev.
Oh, shit. He's a detective.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.183
Fuck! Get the drugs out!

27:00.227 --> 27:02.533
I can see you through
the tempered glass.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.581
Kev, no. Kev!

27:06.625 --> 27:07.582
Kev!

27:09.628 --> 27:11.586
Hi, I'm Peter.
I'm the neighbor.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.544
-How are you?
-How you doin?

27:13.588 --> 27:15.982
Nice to meet you.
Sorry, my pet koala
wandered over here again.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.374
Ugh! This keeps happening.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.549
I just want to grab
the little guy.

27:18.593 --> 27:19.855
My bad. Hi.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.814
So... you just--
you just got a pet koala?

27:21.857 --> 27:23.424
Yeah, pet koala, yeah.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.252
It started off as a prank
from my brother-in-law.

27:25.295 --> 27:27.036
But eight years
and one divorce later,

27:27.080 --> 27:29.560
it's the only thing I love,
so... joke's on him.

27:34.740 --> 27:35.915
-Is LeBron here?
-Get this guy.

27:35.958 --> 27:36.829
-Huh?
-Uh...

27:36.872 --> 27:38.091
Is LeBron home?

27:38.134 --> 27:39.570
-Um...
-No?

27:40.136 --> 27:41.529
Ugh!

27:41.572 --> 27:43.444
I just wanted to talk
to the big guy.

27:43.487 --> 27:46.229
Still haven't met him
and I was hoping
to chat him up a bit

27:46.273 --> 27:47.883
and maybe show him something.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.233
Yo, man. Whoa!

27:50.277 --> 27:52.105
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't do that anymore.

27:52.148 --> 27:53.715
Look at this.

27:53.759 --> 27:54.934
Sign my jers.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.328
Lake show. Big fan.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.548
He's actually away on vaca--

28:00.591 --> 28:02.463
-He not here. Yeah.
-Business.

28:02.506 --> 28:05.074
-Miami, Cleveland.
Whole bunch of stuff.
-Wife, kids...

28:05.118 --> 28:06.902
-Oh, he's gone.
-Yeah.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.209
Who are you guys?

28:09.252 --> 28:11.080
-We're his lawyers.
-We're his cousins.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.650
I'm his cousin, Kenton.
This is his court lawyer.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.739
-Nice to meet you.
What's your name?
-I'm Deez.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.045
Deez. Deez what?

28:19.088 --> 28:20.350
-Deez--
-Hey, uh...

28:20.394 --> 28:22.526
You said
you're the... neighbor.

28:22.570 --> 28:25.051
Yeah, I live just over those
bushes, right down the hill.

28:25.094 --> 28:27.053
-That's where I am.
-Got it.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.359
-All right,
I'm gonna skedaddle.
-Ske-what?

28:29.403 --> 28:31.144
By the way...

28:31.187 --> 28:32.188
Black lives matter.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.626
-They do.
-Yes, they do.

28:35.670 --> 28:39.195
I posted two squares
on my Instagram. Respect.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.284
-Hell, yeah.
-All right, guys. Toodles.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.373
Toodle-what?

28:43.417 --> 28:45.288
Marley!
Come here, girl!

28:45.332 --> 28:46.594
Marley!

28:46.637 --> 28:48.161
Marley!

28:48.204 --> 28:49.292
Fuck, that was weird.

28:52.078 --> 28:54.297
But we still need to buy
some liquor and stuff.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.560
-You got some bread?
-Hell, yeah.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.090
My whole life's savings.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.614
All 347 dollars.

29:06.657 --> 29:09.748
All right, with my money,
we should be good.

29:09.791 --> 29:12.620
I still need to let Venus know
the whole plan, though.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.404
She on the way
with her cousin Mika right now.

29:14.448 --> 29:17.364
Mika? Fine Mika?

29:17.407 --> 29:20.584
Good. Get a head start
on the competition.

29:20.628 --> 29:23.805
There's about to be a gang
of NBA niggas up in here.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.114
Vic.

29:31.378 --> 29:32.379
What's up, homie?

29:33.293 --> 29:34.555
Hold this.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.252
Damn.

29:36.296 --> 29:38.689
It's like the Kardashians
up in this motherfucker, man.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.213
You bring speakers, right?

29:40.343 --> 29:41.431
-Yeah. They out there
on the truck.
-All right.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.825
I almost got robbed by a gang
of crackheads on the way over.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.609
We're gonna put
the DJ booth over here.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.133
Yeah, yeah, surely.

29:47.176 --> 29:48.003

Hell, no. Never vodka.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.671
Never vodka.

30:03.714 --> 30:05.238
-That's rum.
-Watch out, bro.

30:05.281 --> 30:07.153
-What, so you gonna
drink on the job?
-Pshh...

30:07.196 --> 30:09.285
Yes. It's my DJ jet fuel.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.679
When I need to turn
this party up,
I'mma hit the bottle.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.289
No, ain't no drinking tonight.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.117
Yeah, Nigga, we not payin'

30:15.161 --> 30:16.640
I thought only while
I was DJ-ing.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.686
We can't take no chance.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.601
You wanna talk about
that time you was DJ-ing
at that frat party?

-No, no, we're not
fighting him on this.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.887
We're fighting right

-Yeah.

All right.
Come on, guys, focus.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.948
By this time tomorrow night,
we'll be counting stacks.

31:02.991 --> 31:05.080
I'll buy a big-ass bottle
of Hennessy myself.

31:06.125 --> 31:07.169
Hennessy Privilege?

-Okay.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.613
-You crazy. You crazy.

31:59.656 --> 32:00.919
We can fix all that, though.

32:02.442 --> 32:05.619
Boy, if you don't
get the hell away from me...

32:05.662 --> 32:08.056
Venus in the house,
shut your mouth.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.755
-What up, Johnny, Jr.?
-What--?

32:11.799 --> 32:13.409
-Huh?
-Oh, my God,

32:15.020 --> 32:17.326
-You know that, right?
-I know. Good to see you.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.242
-Good to see you, too.
You look good.
-I'm all right.

32:20.286 --> 32:22.375
Nice. Colors of the rainbow.
I see you.

32:22.418 --> 32:24.159
Thank you for bringing
your cousin, too.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.248

thirsty as hell.

32:26.292 --> 32:29.469
Yeah, she just flew
in from Houston
to promote that Tummy Tea.

32:29.512 --> 32:30.992
Wish me luck.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.428
Got one shorty in the back.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.300

32:47.574 --> 32:49.663
About that.

32:49.706 --> 32:51.970
-What? What's wrong?
-Everything's fine.

32:52.013 --> 32:53.623
Um...

32:53.667 --> 32:55.756
-I do need your help
with something.
-What?

32:57.627 --> 32:59.107
Are you stupid?

32:59.151 --> 33:00.413
I just need you
to return the keys.

33:01.327 --> 33:03.372
All right. Yeah, there you go.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.461
-Mika. Come on, let's go.
-Wait, wait. Wait--

33:05.505 --> 33:08.377
Kevin-- Mika, come on.
Let's-- Get off of me!

33:08.421 --> 33:10.553
Why y'all leaving, man?

33:10.597 --> 33:14.166
Y'all idiots are trying
to throw a party
in LeBron's house, that's why!

33:14.209 --> 33:15.645
-This is LeBron's house?
-Wait.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.343
Yeah, it's regular.

33:17.386 --> 33:19.432
Wait, Venus.
Don't leave! Don't--
Don't leave!

33:19.475 --> 33:21.521
V, I know this is crazy.

33:21.564 --> 33:23.523
But you know me.

33:23.566 --> 33:24.828
I wouldn't do
something like this
unless I was desperate.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.963
I gotta pay for my
daughter's school.

33:29.007 --> 33:32.836
I lost this job,
the money I invested
for the party.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.664
I start my new job in,
like, a month.

33:34.708 --> 33:37.711
Look, I'm telling you,
I have a plan.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.280
But we can't do
this without you.

33:42.542 --> 33:43.760
Yeah, he can't do
this without--

33:43.804 --> 33:45.153
-Shut up.
-All right.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.374
I'm not wasting my years
in college for this shit.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.071
And I'm about
to get a promotion.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.377
Mmm. No.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.074
Y'all can ruin y'all's lives.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.729
-I'm not. I'm out.
-Wait, Venus--

33:55.772 --> 33:57.905
Damn, we just got here.

33:57.948 --> 34:02.127
I just want to take
a couple cute pics
and then we can go. Please?

34:02.170 --> 34:03.432
At least check out the pool.

34:07.306 --> 34:10.265
Ooh. Slim waist, fat ass.

34:10.309 --> 34:11.527
Y'all wanna get this tea.

34:12.659 --> 34:15.009
Okay, I see you, sis.

34:18.099 --> 34:22.625
Kevin, this is a really,
really bad idea.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.455
It's kinda dope, though, right?

34:27.935 --> 34:30.590
-I mean, we in LeBron's house.
-Yeah.

34:30.633 --> 34:35.116
He probably sat right here
and contemplated on
killing J.R. Smith.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.423
I'm contemplating
killing you right now.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.425
Come on, V. Relax.

34:39.468 --> 34:41.557
Why does everyone
keep telling me to relax?

34:41.601 --> 34:43.733
I mean, you probably should
just relax a little bit.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.083
I mean, you be a little tense.

34:47.607 --> 34:49.391
Look, but I'm serious.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.263

don't come around

-Yeah.

Oh, yeah. You know.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.111
Just taking it out for a drive.

37:24.154 --> 37:26.722
I've never seen one of these
in real life. Is it fast?

37:26.766 --> 37:28.420
I can show you better
than I can tell you.

37:29.464 --> 37:30.596
-Yeah.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.860
-Right?
-Yup. Yeah.

37:36.558 --> 37:37.951
Yeah.
I'm doing it, right?

37:38.952 --> 37:41.215
Stop it! Don't lie to me.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.435

37:43.478 --> 37:45.915
Music has always
been your calling.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.310
You still making beats?

37:49.354 --> 37:52.618
From time to time,
fucking around with Damon.

37:52.661 --> 37:55.708
To be real, making beats
is a waste of time
if I ain't making bread.

37:57.405 --> 38:00.278
I should focus
on something real.

38:00.321 --> 38:03.411
One of my uncles
in New Orleans
actually does music.

38:03.455 --> 38:08.764

life threw at him,
he never gave up.

38:08.808 --> 38:12.812

his dreams come true...
you definitely can.

38:15.205 --> 38:17.643
What about you?

38:17.686 --> 38:20.776
I remember my mom made me go
to those little ballet recitals
you did for Christmas.

38:22.343 --> 38:24.345
You didn't give up
on your dream, did you?

a motherfucker right now, dawg.

55:27.802 --> 55:29.195
Cock-blockin'?

55:29.238 --> 55:31.023
Nigga, you got these hos
in here, stealing.

55:31.066 --> 55:33.025
Have you seen how
out-of-control this party is?

55:33.068 --> 55:34.940
What, like in
a "go viral" type way?

55:34.983 --> 55:37.464
Man, look at all this money
we done made, bro.

55:37.508 --> 55:38.944
Destiny is good.

55:38.987 --> 55:41.250
The last thing
we want to do is go viral.

55:41.294 --> 55:43.514
Remember, we gotta pay
to clean all this shit up.

55:43.557 --> 55:46.255
-The house is fucked up!
-Hey, man. Bro, chill.

55:46.299 --> 55:48.127
Nigga, it's a party, bro.

55:48.170 --> 55:49.128
Shit is lit.

55:50.564 --> 55:52.914
We been going crazy on IG, too.

55:52.958 --> 55:53.785
Check the feeds.

55:54.655 --> 55:56.178
What is you doing?

55:56.222 --> 55:58.398
We're about to get shut
the fuck down.

55:58.442 --> 56:00.182
We gotta pay for shit.

56:00.226 --> 56:01.880
We ain't even made
the money we need yet!

56:03.316 --> 56:05.057
Bro, I'm deleting
all this shit.

56:05.100 --> 56:08.190
-It's way too much.
-Chill. All right? Relax.

56:08.234 --> 56:09.931
They're gonna trace
the party back to us.

56:10.845 --> 56:12.107
I'm done after this.

56:12.151 --> 56:13.935
All right, look, man.
We just...

56:13.979 --> 56:16.895
When summer come around,
we just go hard
on the promotion,

56:16.938 --> 56:18.418
switch up the strategy--

56:18.462 --> 56:20.812
I don't think you heard me,
I'm done, bro.

56:20.855 --> 56:22.901
I'm making the money
I need and I'm out.

56:22.944 --> 56:24.642
Damn, man. Bro.

56:24.685 --> 56:26.470
What the fuck, man? Wait, bro.

56:26.513 --> 56:29.995
Why is everything always
about you, bro, huh?

56:30.038 --> 56:31.431
You ever thought
about what I'll do

56:31.475 --> 56:33.607
after you dip on me
to take that IT job?

56:33.651 --> 56:35.174
You're selfish as fuck, bro.

56:35.217 --> 56:36.958
-I'm selfish?
-Hell, yeah.

56:37.002 --> 56:39.308
Everything you do is fucked up.

56:39.352 --> 56:40.832
Everything has been your fault.

56:40.875 --> 56:42.790
Yeah, this bangin'-ass
party I threw

56:42.834 --> 56:44.749
to get you money
for your daughter is my fault?

56:44.792 --> 56:47.447
Yes! We wouldn't even
be in this position

56:47.491 --> 56:48.796
if you hadn't got us
kicked off the other one.

56:49.710 --> 56:51.669
I got a life, bro.

56:51.712 --> 56:53.105
I got real responsibilities.

56:53.148 --> 56:55.020
I have a daughter.
You wouldn't understand.

56:55.063 --> 56:57.414
You acting like I
ain't had your back
since day one, bro.

56:57.457 --> 57:00.852
Destiny is my goddaughter,
and I take that shit
very serious.

57:00.895 --> 57:03.550
I keep putting you
in a position to win, nigga!

57:03.594 --> 57:06.814
And all that shit you done
blame me for, bro...

57:06.858 --> 57:09.077
I ain't force you to do
none of that.

57:09.121 --> 57:11.166
You gotta take
responsibility for that.

57:11.210 --> 57:12.733
And Destiny is not
your goddaughter.

57:12.777 --> 57:14.169
So, stop sayin' that.

57:14.213 --> 57:15.562
You think if something
happened to me

57:15.606 --> 57:17.869
I'd put my child's life
in your hands?

57:17.912 --> 57:19.740
I mean, you're irresponsible
as fuck.

57:22.090 --> 57:24.005
Umm.

57:24.049 --> 57:25.137
Can I have my shirt?

57:33.798 --> 57:34.755
Rude.

57:37.932 --> 57:41.066
Yeah. I know you see
that big ol' booty.

57:42.067 --> 57:43.198
That's because of me, nigga.

57:45.940 --> 57:47.376
Ain't no pleasing you, man.

57:50.336 --> 57:51.729
I stay lookin' out for you.

57:52.904 --> 57:54.035
But who lookin' out for Damon?

57:54.079 --> 57:56.603
Damon is lookin' out for Damon.

57:56.647 --> 57:58.910
Why else would you be up here
while this party goin' to shit?

58:00.172 --> 58:01.521
It's like you get me
out of shit

58:01.565 --> 58:02.957
just to get me
into even bigger shit.

58:06.744 --> 58:07.919
Is that Daisy's chain?

58:08.876 --> 58:10.530
Hmm.

58:10.574 --> 58:11.923
So, you did take that shit?

58:15.492 --> 58:17.015
I gotta go clean up your mess.

58:24.370 --> 58:25.458
You could tell he was broke?

58:25.502 --> 58:26.459
I could tell.

58:26.503 --> 58:27.547
It was the corduroy?

58:27.591 --> 58:30.028
I see something.

58:30.071 --> 58:31.246
You see what?

58:33.031 --> 58:35.555
Kamika! Girl...

58:37.426 --> 58:38.471
He look broke, too.

58:49.917 --> 58:51.571
Oh, Kevin, Kevin!

58:51.615 --> 58:53.007
You know what's crazy?

58:53.051 --> 58:54.618
Excuse me.

58:54.661 --> 58:56.358
I'm actually
having a good time.

58:56.402 --> 58:57.621
I'm a little tipsy.

58:57.664 --> 58:59.666
But I'm having a good time.

58:59.710 --> 59:00.972
Are you all right? What's good?

59:01.015 --> 59:02.408
No, this party's going to shit.

59:03.061 --> 59:04.105
Are you serious?

59:04.149 --> 59:05.629
Everything's fine, Kevin.

59:06.630 --> 59:07.587
Look at it. People are--

59:07.631 --> 59:09.763
White girl on a table.

59:09.807 --> 59:12.026
Damon has fucked up
everything, as usual.

59:12.070 --> 59:13.985
I know the neighbors
done called the cops by now.

59:14.028 --> 59:15.029
I need to go outside
and check it.

59:15.073 --> 59:16.814
No, don't-- Look.

59:16.857 --> 59:19.817
Is Damon an idiot? Sure.

59:19.860 --> 59:21.209
Hell, yes, actually.

59:21.253 --> 59:23.255
But you knew that.

59:23.298 --> 59:25.910
So, some of this
is on you, right?

59:27.651 --> 59:31.480
But it's okay, because...
because you got this, okay?

59:31.524 --> 59:33.047
We got this, okay?

59:33.091 --> 59:34.266
We're gonna figure this out.

59:35.659 --> 59:38.705
Relax. Remember?

59:42.361 --> 59:45.103
Oh, Vic, you all right?

59:45.146 --> 59:49.368
See, it's five minutes ago,
and I was in a room
with a koala and shit.

59:49.411 --> 59:53.328
And now it's
45 minutes in the future,
and now I'm eating waffles.

59:53.372 --> 59:55.287
-What?
-He hit the blunt.

59:55.330 --> 59:57.158
He thinks he's time traveling.

59:57.202 --> 1:00:01.772
DJ, you need to get your ass
back in that booth, man.

1:00:01.815 --> 1:00:03.687
That booth is a prison.

1:00:03.730 --> 1:00:06.864
And I will not be jailed
in your timeline, okay?

1:00:07.691 --> 1:00:08.866
1976...

1:00:10.519 --> 1:00:11.477
Weirdo.

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:13.958
Where Damon at, man?

1:00:20.051 --> 1:00:22.009
Weak-ass art.

1:00:22.053 --> 1:00:24.185
Oh, she got some titties.

1:00:26.797 --> 1:00:27.841
Yo, Damon!

1:00:27.885 --> 1:00:29.495
Damon!

1:00:29.538 --> 1:00:31.540
Where you at, you little bitch?

1:00:36.545 --> 1:00:38.199
♪ It's hard to grow up

1:00:45.119 --> 1:00:46.425
♪ 'm a blow up...

1:00:49.471 --> 1:00:51.648
This crazy.

1:00:54.085 --> 1:00:55.652
What the fuck is this?

1:00:56.740 --> 1:00:57.784
Cocaina.

1:01:05.879 --> 1:01:06.837
Fine with me.

1:01:11.537 --> 1:01:13.408
They throwing a party
at LeBron James's house?

1:01:17.630 --> 1:01:19.023
-Do you see this?
-I see that.

1:01:19.066 --> 1:01:20.546
That's Cleveland right there.

1:01:20.589 --> 1:01:22.635
-Open this up. Open this up.
-I get that side.

1:01:22.679 --> 1:01:23.941
Do the math.
You get that side.

1:01:23.984 --> 1:01:25.594
There's gotta
be a lock.

1:01:25.638 --> 1:01:27.031
No, no.
It's on the top.
The angle--

1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:29.294
Ooh!

1:01:29.337 --> 1:01:30.556
Works every time.

1:01:37.781 --> 1:01:39.608
What y'all think this worth?

1:01:39.652 --> 1:01:43.134
Well, shit, way more
than what we got right now.

1:01:43.177 --> 1:01:45.484
Come on, y'all,
we can't steal
from the GOAT, James.

1:01:45.527 --> 1:01:47.225
You know what I'm saying?
That's crazy.

1:01:47.268 --> 1:01:49.009
What, you a Laker fan?

1:01:49.053 --> 1:01:51.098
Hell no, nigga,
I'm a gymnastics fan.

1:01:52.143 --> 1:01:53.535
Well, we in business, then.

1:01:53.579 --> 1:01:54.449
Let's go.

1:01:58.976 --> 1:02:00.064
You can do this.

1:02:00.107 --> 1:02:01.152
You can do this.

1:02:05.809 --> 1:02:07.071
Man, what the fuck?

1:02:07.114 --> 1:02:09.160
Man, put on some
Migos or something.

1:02:09.203 --> 1:02:10.988
It's 1998, bro.

1:02:11.031 --> 1:02:13.207
The Migos don't exist yet.

1:02:15.296 --> 1:02:16.907
Hey. Come on, now. Wait up.

1:02:16.950 --> 1:02:18.560

1:02:28.353 --> 1:02:31.138
We gonna beat your fucking ass!

1:02:33.097 --> 1:02:35.316
Open the door!
Hey, open the door.

1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:37.231

drama for us.

1:02:37.275 --> 1:02:39.756
Open the door!

1:02:56.903 --> 1:02:58.165
You know what I'mma do?

1:02:58.209 --> 1:02:59.906

1:03:02.474 --> 1:03:05.433
And then very slowly,

1:03:05.477 --> 1:03:08.828
I'm gonna pull your organs out
with tweezers, nigga.

1:03:08.872 --> 1:03:11.700
-Like Operation?
-Exactly like Operation.

1:03:11.744 --> 1:03:13.311
It's my favorite game,
you know why?

1:03:14.225 --> 1:03:15.835
Requires concentration.

1:03:15.879 --> 1:03:17.750
First you go steal
Daisy's chain.

1:03:17.794 --> 1:03:19.230
And then you gonna
steal my crowd?

1:03:19.273 --> 1:03:21.449
First of all, it was my crowd.

1:03:21.493 --> 1:03:23.147
All right?

1:03:23.190 --> 1:03:24.801

Ooh.

1:03:44.951 --> 1:03:46.387
-Wait!

1:03:46.431 --> 1:03:47.736

1:03:49.042 --> 1:03:50.609
Whoa! Oh, hell no!

1:03:50.652 --> 1:03:51.958
Who got the keys?

1:03:52.002 --> 1:03:53.003

1:04:05.189 --> 1:04:07.452

Come here. Come here, girl.

1:04:20.073 --> 1:04:22.597
Hi, buddy.

1:04:22.641 --> 1:04:24.382
Aren't you so cute!

1:04:26.210 --> 1:04:27.211
Let you go.

1:04:39.919 --> 1:04:41.529
Yeah, I'm good. Yeah.

1:04:41.573 --> 1:04:43.270

1:04:43.314 --> 1:04:46.578
It's Damon, like the French...

1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:49.450
Well, I'm Mya.

1:04:50.887 --> 1:04:52.366
Yeah, I know who you are.

1:04:53.411 --> 1:04:54.629
But how do you know my name?

1:04:54.673 --> 1:04:55.935
Oh, your e-mail.

1:04:55.979 --> 1:04:57.806
You said you'd be
wearing a flower.

1:05:00.679 --> 1:05:02.072
So, you got my letter, huh?

1:05:02.115 --> 1:05:03.290
Yeah, uh...

1:05:04.857 --> 1:05:08.469
Your letter was just
so touching and poetic...

1:05:08.513 --> 1:05:09.993
I had to meet
the person who wrote it.

1:05:12.299 --> 1:05:13.474
What's wrong with you, bro?

1:05:13.518 --> 1:05:14.911
You had one job.
Play the music.

1:05:18.131 --> 1:05:20.481
To create
a quantum computer...

1:05:22.092 --> 1:05:24.877
-Vic!
-Quantum computer...

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:26.618
Man, this shit

1:05:26.661 --> 1:05:29.055
-Vic, turn the music back on.
-Quantum computer--

1:05:29.099 --> 1:05:31.536
-Music is bad, man.
-Quantum com--

1:05:31.579 --> 1:05:35.279
Music is just waves...

1:05:35.322 --> 1:05:36.628
We ain't made our money yet.

1:05:36.671 --> 1:05:37.716
We gotta keep the party going.

1:05:37.759 --> 1:05:39.283
Plug it back up. Come on.

1:05:42.503 --> 1:05:43.852

1:05:55.168 --> 1:05:57.736
Just-- Sorry about that, folks.

1:05:57.779 --> 1:06:00.434
We'll be up and running
in a second.

1:06:00.478 --> 1:06:03.176
2 Chainz! We got 2 Chainz
in this motherfucker!

1:06:03.220 --> 1:06:04.656
Yo, my nigga, yeah!

1:06:04.699 --> 1:06:07.267
Come up here
and perform a couple songs.

1:06:07.311 --> 1:06:09.878
Nigga, I am not 2 Chainz.

1:06:10.705 --> 1:06:12.229
Shit weak, bro.

1:06:12.272 --> 1:06:15.014
Man, fuck this ol' bullshit
weak-ass party.

1:06:15.058 --> 1:06:16.494
Know what I'm saying?

1:06:16.537 --> 1:06:17.930
I hit him with a karate chop
on his neck.

1:06:17.974 --> 1:06:19.497
I was, like, pow,
you know what I'm saying?

1:06:19.540 --> 1:06:22.021
Oh, my God, Damon,
you are so crazy.

1:06:22.065 --> 1:06:24.458
Well, you know I done
forgot my pills, so, you know.

1:06:25.503 --> 1:06:26.417
Off the hook.

1:06:32.292 --> 1:06:33.815
Sounds pretty bad in there.

1:06:35.165 --> 1:06:37.036
You want to get out of here?

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:39.343
We could grab
a drink someplace.

1:06:39.386 --> 1:06:40.866
Everybody just calm down.

1:06:40.909 --> 1:06:42.607
We gonna figure this out.

1:06:42.650 --> 1:06:44.391
Come on, man.
Don't break stuff.

1:06:44.435 --> 1:06:45.479
Shit.

1:06:49.092 --> 1:06:51.224
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,
but that's my friend.

1:06:51.268 --> 1:06:53.661
He dyin' in there.

1:06:53.705 --> 1:06:55.794
You know, I just
can't leave him like that.

1:07:00.364 --> 1:07:01.582
You look great, by the way.

1:07:04.455 --> 1:07:06.761
What the fuck, DJ?
This ain't juice.

1:07:09.068 --> 1:07:11.375
All right, everybody,
calm down, calm down.

1:07:11.418 --> 1:07:12.463
All right?

1:07:16.293 --> 1:07:18.599
-Damon, what you doing?
-Turn me up.

1:07:22.299 --> 1:07:25.084
For real, man.
Check my boy, Kev,
on the beat one time.

1:07:25.128 --> 1:07:27.913
His shit goin' crazy.
All right?

1:07:27.956 --> 1:07:29.828
Why is this bro playing
beats at a party?

1:07:29.871 --> 1:07:31.699
Seriously, thank y'all
for coming out.

1:07:31.743 --> 1:07:34.137
-Appreciate y'all so much.
-I actually fuck with it.

1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:35.790
So, I got some news

1:07:37.531 --> 1:07:39.925
Yeah... them niggas not coming.

1:07:41.013 --> 1:07:42.493
But, fuck all that. All right?

1:07:42.536 --> 1:07:45.061
We got stars galore,

1:07:45.104 --> 1:07:47.193
Y'all still trying

1:07:47.237 --> 1:07:49.587
I said, y'all trying to have
a good time, right?

1:07:49.630 --> 1:07:51.763

1:07:51.806 --> 1:07:53.939

Yeah,

1:08:11.174 --> 1:08:15.308
Cash Money Records taking over
for the '99 and 2000.

1:08:17.354 --> 1:08:19.747
This is what you want! Yeah!

1:08:19.791 --> 1:08:22.446
Get out the way,

1:08:25.927 --> 1:08:27.059
Ahh!

1:08:27.103 --> 1:08:28.408

1:08:28.452 --> 1:08:29.670
Come on, coach,
"Back that azz up."

1:08:29.714 --> 1:08:31.629
Man, I only got
one job tonight.

1:08:31.672 --> 1:08:34.284
And that is to keep you
healthy and safe.

1:08:34.327 --> 1:08:36.590
-My goodness--
-Season starts in weeks.

1:08:36.634 --> 1:08:37.852
-Come on--
-Odell...

1:08:39.463 --> 1:08:40.377
You agreed.

1:08:45.208 --> 1:08:46.861
Odell!

1:08:47.819 --> 1:08:50.691
Now, you know he dead.

1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:03.226
Juvie, I love you!

1:09:03.269 --> 1:09:05.793
Answer my DMs! Answer my DMs!

1:09:11.190 --> 1:09:14.019
I wanna send
a special shout-out
to my niece, Venus,

1:09:14.062 --> 1:09:16.587
for bringin' me down here
and making this shit possible.

1:09:16.630 --> 1:09:18.371
Look, man,

1:09:18.415 --> 1:09:20.286
We in the King's mansion.

1:09:23.507 --> 1:09:25.335
♪ Hell, yeah!

1:09:28.294 --> 1:09:29.774
♪ Hell, yeah!

1:09:29.817 --> 1:09:33.908
You got Juvenile to perform
last minute? How?

1:09:33.952 --> 1:09:37.173
That's my uncle
from New Orleans
I was telling you about.

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.046
Wait, Juvenile's your uncle?

1:09:41.089 --> 1:09:44.702
Wait, wait. How come
you never said anything?

1:09:44.745 --> 1:09:46.051
I don't know.

1:09:46.094 --> 1:09:49.010
He's just my Uncle Terry
that I never see.

1:09:49.054 --> 1:09:51.752
He just happened to be in town
for my sister's graduation.

1:09:54.842 --> 1:09:56.017
Venus, I--

1:09:56.061 --> 1:09:57.497
I can't thank you enough.

1:09:57.541 --> 1:09:58.629
Hey, man!
Give it up for Juvie...

1:09:58.672 --> 1:10:02.285
We're in this together. Okay?

1:10:02.328 --> 1:10:04.939
-Oh, hey. Kenton, right?
-Oh, my--

1:10:04.983 --> 1:10:06.071
I don't know
what's going on here, pal,

1:10:06.114 --> 1:10:08.552
but the party is over. O-V-E-R.

1:10:08.595 --> 1:10:12.469
I found my sweet
little Marley here
higher than a giraffe's vagina,

1:10:12.512 --> 1:10:14.166
and I found this in her pouch.

1:10:14.210 --> 1:10:15.907
Drugs! Gummy drugs!

1:10:15.950 --> 1:10:17.300
Crack, probably.

1:10:17.343 --> 1:10:18.692
Makes me sick.
I'm calling the police.

1:10:18.736 --> 1:10:20.128
-Peter...
-I'm calling the cops.

1:10:20.172 --> 1:10:21.478
-Hey.
-Hello. I'm glad
you're here too.

1:10:21.521 --> 1:10:22.783
The cops are gonna
come get you, too.

1:10:22.827 --> 1:10:23.871
-Peter--
-You're all going to prison.

1:10:25.090 --> 1:10:28.006
Look at this cute-ass koala!

1:10:28.049 --> 1:10:29.834
-Well... Yeah.
-Aww.

1:10:29.877 --> 1:10:31.923
Ooh. Let me take
a picture with it.

1:10:31.966 --> 1:10:34.273
-Well, she's on drugs, but...
-My followers gonna love this!

1:10:34.317 --> 1:10:36.971
Yeah... Mika. Mika.

1:10:37.015 --> 1:10:39.365
Peter is super-influential.

1:10:39.409 --> 1:10:43.413
I mean, he got a bunch of stuff
you could take pictures
with back at his crib.

1:10:43.456 --> 1:10:45.371
He's one of LeBron's
rich neighbors.

1:10:45.415 --> 1:10:47.504
Yeah, I do-- Yes. Yeah.

1:10:47.547 --> 1:10:50.202
Well, I have a--
I have a private jet.

1:10:50.246 --> 1:10:52.335
-Is that right?
-That is right.

1:10:52.378 --> 1:10:54.293
-I would like to see it.
-I want to show it to you.

1:10:56.252 --> 1:10:58.471
Hi. Marley. Hi, baby.

1:10:58.515 --> 1:11:00.865
Damn. Shit.
That was close, bro.

1:11:00.908 --> 1:11:03.433
-There you are. Hey.
-Oh, hey.

1:11:03.476 --> 1:11:07.088
Oh, shit. Mya?

1:11:07.132 --> 1:11:10.048
-This the friend
that was getting booed?
-Mm-hmm.

1:11:10.091 --> 1:11:11.832
You know he came back
for you, right?

1:11:11.876 --> 1:11:13.791
Instead of leaving with me.

1:11:13.834 --> 1:11:15.445
You got a good one right here.

1:11:21.886 --> 1:11:22.713
Uh...

1:11:23.801 --> 1:11:25.193
Truce?

1:11:25.237 --> 1:11:26.064
Huh?

1:11:27.761 --> 1:11:28.762
Truce?

1:11:35.726 --> 1:11:36.596
Mmm.

1:11:37.728 --> 1:11:38.946
Hey, yo.

1:11:38.990 --> 1:11:40.296
We got a big problem.

1:11:41.035 --> 1:11:41.949
What the fuck!

1:11:41.993 --> 1:11:43.821
Man, how'd this happen?

1:11:43.864 --> 1:11:46.563
I asked Vic to watch the door
to take a piss, but he bailed.

1:11:46.606 --> 1:11:49.957
Vic? That's the wrong person
you ask to watch anything!

1:11:50.001 --> 1:11:51.959
-Oh, my bad.
-Yo, question.

1:11:53.047 --> 1:11:54.310
Was it the Miami ring?

1:11:55.615 --> 1:11:57.313
'Cause he didn't deserve
that shit.

1:11:57.356 --> 1:11:59.010
-No.
-You think this shit funny?

1:11:59.053 --> 1:12:00.533
-Sorry.
-I could lose
my daughter, bro.

1:12:00.577 --> 1:12:01.839
Just trying
to lighten the mood.

1:12:01.882 --> 1:12:03.275
Sly, you got to keep
the door moving.

1:12:03.319 --> 1:12:04.581
We need to make sure
we got enough

1:12:04.624 --> 1:12:06.147
to cover the damages
to the house.

1:12:06.191 --> 1:12:07.714
How the fuck we gonna
replace the ring, though?

1:12:07.758 --> 1:12:09.368
Fuck!

1:12:09.412 --> 1:12:11.327
Sly, I need you
to search everybody, all right?

1:12:11.370 --> 1:12:13.938
We gotta find that ring.

1:12:13.981 --> 1:12:15.374
Didn't you have
more guys with you?

1:12:15.418 --> 1:12:17.507
I had my cousin, Gavin.

1:12:17.550 --> 1:12:18.812
But I ain't seen him in hours.

1:12:20.118 --> 1:12:22.207
I've been wanting this all day.

1:12:22.250 --> 1:12:23.600
Thank you, brother. Yes, sir.

1:12:24.992 --> 1:12:26.646
Damn, that's all you?

1:12:26.690 --> 1:12:30.389
Yes! These are my
Obama specials. Okay?

1:12:30.433 --> 1:12:33.697
I voted for him... three times.

1:12:34.872 --> 1:12:37.570
Yes we can. Yes we can.

1:12:37.614 --> 1:12:40.007
-Everybody, hands!
-Let me see your hands.

1:12:40.051 --> 1:12:42.488
Everybody. Yo, hands.

1:12:45.839 --> 1:12:48.015
Got it! Here it is.

1:12:48.059 --> 1:12:50.409
-Yo, where'd you
get this ring at?
-Man, I won it.

1:12:50.453 --> 1:12:52.193
You win this ring, man?
Prove it!

1:12:52.237 --> 1:12:54.631
Bro, I'm Tristan Thompson.

1:12:54.674 --> 1:12:58.156
Oh. It is Tristan Thompson!
Yo, but your hand big!

1:12:58.199 --> 1:13:01.464
God damn. I thought you had
elephantitis or some shit, man.

1:13:01.507 --> 1:13:03.988
-Sly, you find it?
-Still working on it.

1:13:04.031 --> 1:13:05.816
We never gonna find
LeBron's ring, bro.

1:13:05.859 --> 1:13:07.252
Kev, we gotta replace it.

1:13:07.295 --> 1:13:08.688
We gotta try
one of them black markets.

1:13:08.732 --> 1:13:11.648
-Wait, y'all lost LeBron's--?

1:13:11.691 --> 1:13:13.040
No, we didn't lose it.

1:13:13.084 --> 1:13:14.955
It was stolen.

1:13:14.999 --> 1:13:17.131
-Are you serious?
-Somebody stole it.

1:13:17.175 --> 1:13:18.698
-I can get another ring.
-Oh!

1:13:18.742 --> 1:13:20.439
Damn, Cudi.
Where'd you come from?

1:13:20.483 --> 1:13:22.702
Wait, wait, wait. wait.
What'd you just say?

1:13:22.746 --> 1:13:24.356
I can get y'all another ring.

1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:26.706
Like another one-of-a-kind
NBA Championship ring?

1:13:26.750 --> 1:13:29.187
Yeah. Just let me
know the year.

1:13:29.230 --> 1:13:30.710
-How?
-What?

1:13:30.754 --> 1:13:33.017
Simple. The Illuminati.

1:13:34.453 --> 1:13:36.063
The Illuminati. Man!

1:13:36.107 --> 1:13:38.675
Man, Cudi, we ain't got time
for this bullshit.

1:13:38.718 --> 1:13:41.634
All right. I was just trying
to help you little niggas.

1:13:43.201 --> 1:13:44.637
Hold on, wait. Cudi.

1:13:44.681 --> 1:13:45.769
You serious?

1:13:45.812 --> 1:13:47.379
Look at me.

1:13:47.423 --> 1:13:49.599
I don't joke
about the Illuminati.

1:13:49.642 --> 1:13:51.949
Come-- Come on, Kev.

1:13:51.992 --> 1:13:53.603
You not buying this, are you?

1:13:53.646 --> 1:13:54.821
I mean, look at this man, bro.

1:13:54.865 --> 1:13:56.475
He is a crazy person.

1:13:56.519 --> 1:13:59.609
Look. He eating
an apple in a party.

1:13:59.652 --> 1:14:01.524
Who eats an apple
in a party, Kev?

1:14:01.567 --> 1:14:03.700
-That's the sign of a madman.
Let's just hear him out.

1:14:03.743 --> 1:14:05.789
Even if we get a replica,
until we find the real one.

1:14:06.790 --> 1:14:07.965
All right, Kev.

1:14:08.008 --> 1:14:09.619
All right. Go ahead.

1:14:09.662 --> 1:14:13.231
All right, so there--
there's rings in this house?

1:14:13.274 --> 1:14:15.538
The Illuminati gets a copy
of every championship trophy

1:14:15.581 --> 1:14:18.758
and rings dating back
to the first
baseball and lacrosse games.

1:14:18.802 --> 1:14:20.238
Lacrosse...

1:14:20.281 --> 1:14:21.457
It's a prestige thing.

1:14:22.762 --> 1:14:23.763
There's a party tonight.

1:14:25.025 --> 1:14:27.375
I'm just gonna skip it.

1:14:27.419 --> 1:14:33.120
Okay-- let's say, for the sake
of this story, I believe you,
and how do we--

1:14:33.164 --> 1:14:34.426
how would we
get one of the rings?

1:14:34.470 --> 1:14:36.472
-How?
-It's the Illuminati.

1:14:36.515 --> 1:14:38.125
Nobody gives a fuck
about that shit.

1:14:38.169 --> 1:14:40.519
We all got money.

1:14:40.563 --> 1:14:43.827
I've seen better cock rings
than NBA Championship rings.

1:14:45.002 --> 1:14:46.264
Okay, that's-- Okay.

1:14:46.307 --> 1:14:47.831
Look, I'll go.

1:14:47.874 --> 1:14:49.049
And you watch the party.

1:14:49.093 --> 1:14:50.964
What? You shitting me, bro?

1:14:51.008 --> 1:14:52.531
The Illuminati?
Man, I gotta see this.

1:14:52.575 --> 1:14:54.315
If he talkin' about something,
I gotta come...

1:14:54.359 --> 1:14:56.230
Somebody got to keep
things under control!

1:14:56.274 --> 1:14:57.841
I'll do it.

1:14:57.884 --> 1:15:01.584
I will watch the party
while you guys... do this.

1:15:01.627 --> 1:15:03.542
I can't ask you
to get involved, though.

1:15:03.586 --> 1:15:04.500
You didn't ask me.

1:15:04.543 --> 1:15:06.284
I'm volunteering.

1:15:06.327 --> 1:15:08.504
Besides, I would've been
left by now.

1:15:16.555 --> 1:15:18.514
Yeah, that's my dawg.

1:15:18.557 --> 1:15:21.560
Hey, I'm sorry to mess
a good moment up,
but we got shit to do.

1:15:21.604 --> 1:15:23.519
Go, go. Yeah, go. Go, go, go.

1:15:26.391 --> 1:15:28.045
Okay, so the plan
is simple.

1:15:28.088 --> 1:15:29.742
I'll bring you two
in as my guests.

1:15:31.657 --> 1:15:33.833
One wrong move and we're dead.

1:15:33.877 --> 1:15:36.053
Just be cool, and don't say
more than you have to.

1:15:36.096 --> 1:15:37.533
These are my two manservants.

1:15:39.535 --> 1:15:41.406
Of course, Scott.

1:15:41.449 --> 1:15:43.582
Damon, you're gonna head
to the trophy room.

1:15:43.626 --> 1:15:45.628
Get in, get out.

1:15:45.671 --> 1:15:47.891
While you do that,
we'll mingle
amongst the crowd.

1:15:56.595 --> 1:15:59.337
Okay. Don't embarrass me.

1:15:59.380 --> 1:16:00.381
Just be cool.

1:16:14.613 --> 1:16:15.701
Mr. Cuban?

1:16:17.616 --> 1:16:21.577
Look, I know you
get this all the time,
but I got this idea.

1:16:21.620 --> 1:16:23.361
I'll buy it.

1:16:23.404 --> 1:16:26.016
But I mean, you haven't even
heard the rest of the idea.

1:16:26.059 --> 1:16:27.234
We'll be in touch.

1:16:27.278 --> 1:16:29.889
Wait, I got my-- a cell phone.

1:16:29.933 --> 1:16:31.021
We'll be in touch.

1:16:31.935 --> 1:16:33.023
Who's "we"?

1:16:36.635 --> 1:16:39.333
A little wine. Okay. Thank you.

1:16:39.377 --> 1:16:40.639
Thank you. All right.

1:16:40.683 --> 1:16:42.293
This is the first ritual.

1:16:42.336 --> 1:16:44.600
Take a sip to show solidarity.

1:16:44.643 --> 1:16:47.559
What kind of wine is this?
It look a little different.

1:16:47.603 --> 1:16:49.953
It's not wine. It's blood.

1:16:49.996 --> 1:16:52.303
-What?
-Drink it,
or you'll blow our cover.

1:16:52.346 --> 1:16:53.652
Oh, hell no.

1:16:53.696 --> 1:16:55.959
Drink that shit, nigga,
right now.

1:16:56.002 --> 1:16:57.308
Come on.

1:16:57.351 --> 1:16:58.352
It smell funny.

1:16:58.396 --> 1:16:59.876
This smell funny.

1:16:59.919 --> 1:17:03.836
Dignified and esteemed
ladies and gentlemen.

1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:07.666
Gather round and honor
our beloved guest,

1:17:07.710 --> 1:17:12.279
Ms. Dolly Parton, who will be
performing a psychedelic rap.

1:17:24.901 --> 1:17:25.902
This crazy.

1:17:38.610 --> 1:17:40.003
Oh, yeah. Okay.

1:17:53.930 --> 1:17:57.368
Before you leave tonight,
do not forget to choose

1:17:57.411 --> 1:17:59.936
which days it will rain
next year.

1:18:01.111 --> 1:18:02.460
Furthermore,

1:18:02.503 --> 1:18:03.591
-the blood drive...
-Right, niggas.

1:18:03.635 --> 1:18:05.376
-has low numbers.
-Let's go.

1:18:05.419 --> 1:18:08.727
So, please donate
on the way out
or find a victim.

1:18:08.771 --> 1:18:10.076
Thank you very much.

1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:11.338
Enjoy the night.

1:18:11.382 --> 1:18:12.688
Oh, shit, man.

1:18:12.731 --> 1:18:14.167
Ain't that Kid 'n' Play?

1:18:15.212 --> 1:18:16.387
God bless you, man.

1:18:20.739 --> 1:18:21.827
Oh.

1:18:21.871 --> 1:18:23.786
What? Y'all trippin', man.

1:18:24.787 --> 1:18:26.049
Intruders!

1:18:26.963 --> 1:18:28.747
Hey, hey, hey...

1:18:28.791 --> 1:18:30.357
Hey, fuck you, Cudi!

1:18:30.401 --> 1:18:32.185
Punch me again,
see what happen, bro.

1:18:32.229 --> 1:18:34.448
Ladies and gentlemen.

1:18:34.492 --> 1:18:37.887
We have two late additions
to tonight's entertainment.

1:18:46.678 --> 1:18:48.506
What the fuck is this?

1:18:54.164 --> 1:18:57.384
Yo, Kev. What the fuck

1:18:57.428 --> 1:19:00.257
Destiny can't grow up
fatherless, bro. Fuck that.

1:19:02.346 --> 1:19:04.435
Yo, check it out.
Y'all gotta snap out of it.

1:19:04.478 --> 1:19:07.438
I got the perfect game plan.
Y'all just gotta follow my--

1:19:13.879 --> 1:19:15.751
Let me get through.
I'm sorry, y'all.

1:19:15.794 --> 1:19:18.231
I'm sorry.
I wanna leave, let me in!

1:19:18.275 --> 1:19:19.537
Are they pointing at us?

1:19:19.580 --> 1:19:20.843
Shit, Kev!
We can take 'em, Kev!

1:19:20.886 --> 1:19:23.236
We can take 'em.
All right, one... two...

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:24.629
Naw, fuck that!

1:19:24.672 --> 1:19:27.414
Man, let me through!
Let me through!

1:19:27.458 --> 1:19:29.939
Bro, let me in.
No? Damn! Oh, shit!

1:19:32.811 --> 1:19:34.900
Not today!

1:19:34.944 --> 1:19:36.554
Oh, come on,
I don't wanna go out there!

1:19:36.597 --> 1:19:37.729
I don't wanna get out!

1:19:46.042 --> 1:19:47.870
Hey, man, I love you, Kev.

1:19:47.913 --> 1:19:49.001
I love you too, man.

1:19:56.182 --> 1:19:57.749
Cudi! Watch out.

1:20:06.845 --> 1:20:08.020
Yeah, motherfucker!

1:20:15.636 --> 1:20:17.595
Ice, ice, baby!

1:20:25.472 --> 1:20:27.823
Are you not entertained?

1:20:27.866 --> 1:20:30.564
Are you motherfuckers
not entertained?

1:20:30.608 --> 1:20:34.090
Cudi! Cudi! Cudi!

1:20:34.133 --> 1:20:35.656
Cudi! Cudi!

1:20:40.009 --> 1:20:42.098
-Oh!

1:20:42.141 --> 1:20:43.534
Oh, shit, get up, Cudi.

1:20:43.577 --> 1:20:45.101
-Get up, Cudi!
-He gon' get up.

1:20:47.799 --> 1:20:49.583
Come on, Kev,
we gotta save him.

1:21:00.943 --> 1:21:03.249
-Oh, shit, Cudi!
-Oh, shit, Cudi.

1:21:03.293 --> 1:21:05.077
Damn.
They fucked him up.

1:21:05.121 --> 1:21:09.342
Oh, shit. Hey, Cudi, man.
You saved our lives, man.

1:21:09.386 --> 1:21:12.302
Damn. Hip-hop really
saved my life, Kev.

1:21:13.651 --> 1:21:15.653
You guys won the blood trials.

1:21:15.696 --> 1:21:17.133
They'll let you go now.

1:21:17.176 --> 1:21:19.222
Hey, Cudi, man.
Stop talking, all right?

1:21:19.265 --> 1:21:21.441
We're gonna
get you to a hospital.

1:21:21.485 --> 1:21:23.008
I mean,
it's the Illuminati, right?

1:21:23.052 --> 1:21:24.662
They gotta have a helicopter
or some shit, man.

1:21:24.705 --> 1:21:26.316
Make sure
LeBron gets this poem.

1:21:26.359 --> 1:21:27.795
Oh, shit, is this the verse?

1:21:27.839 --> 1:21:30.102
-Only he can read it.
-Damn.

1:21:31.974 --> 1:21:34.063
Oh, shit.
Don't die on us, man.

1:21:34.106 --> 1:21:35.760
Hey, Cudi, man.
Don't die on us, man!

1:21:35.803 --> 1:21:37.066
Don't worry about me.

1:21:37.109 --> 1:21:38.241
I'll be fine.

1:21:39.155 --> 1:21:41.113
They'll bring me back.

1:21:41.157 --> 1:21:42.985
I'm actually the fourth Cudi.

1:21:45.813 --> 1:21:47.728
I knew it.

1:21:47.772 --> 1:21:49.992
You both have been
the realest friends
I've had in years.

1:21:51.819 --> 1:21:52.951
Wait, really?

1:21:52.995 --> 1:21:54.779
-We just met you.
-Yeah.

1:21:55.519 --> 1:21:56.694
Vibes.

1:21:58.304 --> 1:21:59.697
Vibes.

1:21:59.740 --> 1:22:01.090
But, hey, I'm serious.

1:22:02.482 --> 1:22:04.528
That's for LeBron's eyes only.

1:22:04.571 --> 1:22:06.443
Oh, Shit.
Kev, give him some CPR.

1:22:06.486 --> 1:22:08.401
Put your lips on him.

1:22:08.445 --> 1:22:10.490
-Oh, shit!
-Hey, man,
he dyin' over there!

1:22:10.534 --> 1:22:12.449
Hey, come on, man! Come on!

1:22:14.059 --> 1:22:16.453
What the fuck just happened?

1:22:16.496 --> 1:22:18.194
I don't even know, bro.

1:22:19.282 --> 1:22:20.587
But man, I need a drink.

1:22:22.633 --> 1:22:23.721
Phew.

1:22:23.764 --> 1:22:25.418
Oh, yeah.

1:22:27.246 --> 1:22:28.073
Mmm.

1:22:30.032 --> 1:22:30.858
Hey...

1:22:32.904 --> 1:22:35.341
Yeah, some of that merlot!

1:22:46.048 --> 1:22:48.006
Man. We dodged a bullet.

1:22:48.050 --> 1:22:49.007
Hell, yeah.

1:22:50.704 --> 1:22:52.184
Let's shut this party down.

1:22:52.228 --> 1:22:53.577
We made enough money
to fix everything.

1:22:54.534 --> 1:22:55.709
Hell, yeah.

1:22:55.753 --> 1:22:57.885
Wait, wait. Cudi's poem.

1:23:07.895 --> 1:23:09.506
Mmm.

1:23:09.549 --> 1:23:11.638
-All right, come on.
-I'll be serious. Let's roll.

1:24:35.026 --> 1:24:38.029
Your assistants.
These two lil' niggas

1:24:38.073 --> 1:24:40.640
-Hey...
-Surprise.

1:24:40.684 --> 1:24:42.860
Hold up.

How did y'all even--

1:24:48.953 --> 1:24:50.085
Who the fuck are you two?

1:24:52.043 --> 1:24:55.786
We work
for the cleaning service
that cleans your house, sir.

1:24:55.829 --> 1:24:57.483
Cleaning service?

1:24:57.527 --> 1:24:59.181
I'm calling the police.
I'm too rich for this shit.

1:24:59.224 --> 1:25:01.008
Don't call the cops, LeBron.

1:25:01.052 --> 1:25:03.402
Look, we are... cleaners.

1:25:03.446 --> 1:25:05.404
But I'm also a young, Black...

1:25:06.753 --> 1:25:09.147

1:25:18.591 --> 1:25:19.853
-Shit.
-My fault.

1:25:20.898 --> 1:25:22.029

1:25:24.771 --> 1:25:27.209
-We could... We could fix that.
-We gonna fix

1:25:27.252 --> 1:25:28.558
-Yeah.
-Easy.

1:25:28.601 --> 1:25:29.907
Ain't you supposed
to be in India,

1:25:29.950 --> 1:25:31.430
meditating for two weeks
or something?

1:25:31.474 --> 1:25:33.563
It only took me one week
to reach enlightenment.

1:25:33.606 --> 1:25:35.347
I'm the fuckin' GOAT.

1:25:35.391 --> 1:25:36.740
Yeah, he is the GOAT.

1:25:36.783 --> 1:25:38.394
-Yeah, yeah. It's true.
-It's true.

1:25:38.437 --> 1:25:40.047
So, let me get this straight.

1:25:40.091 --> 1:25:44.008
Y'all broke into my crib...

1:25:44.051 --> 1:25:46.097
and then go to tear my
shit up, too?

1:25:46.141 --> 1:25:49.622
I mean, you make it bad
when you put it like that,
you know, it's--

1:25:49.666 --> 1:25:52.625
-We had a key.
-Okay, let me say
it like this, then.

1:25:52.669 --> 1:25:53.800
Both of you niggas
goin' to jail.

1:25:53.844 --> 1:25:55.411
Oh, no, wait, man!

1:25:55.454 --> 1:25:57.195
LeBron,
don't call the cops, man.

1:25:57.239 --> 1:25:59.066
All right, man.
Look, man. The truth is...

1:26:00.329 --> 1:26:02.200
this is my dawg, all right?

1:26:02.244 --> 1:26:04.071
He ain't had nothing

1:26:04.115 --> 1:26:06.291
This whole party,

1:26:07.727 --> 1:26:09.120
Okay, cool.

1:26:09.164 --> 1:26:10.252
So, they could just take you.

1:26:10.295 --> 1:26:12.906
Damn, man! Oh, God.

1:26:12.950 --> 1:26:14.647
No! I don't wanna go to jail.

1:26:14.691 --> 1:26:16.954
All right! All right, uh...

1:26:16.997 --> 1:26:20.087
Let me... let me give you
a proposition, all right?

1:26:21.350 --> 1:26:22.960
-Play me for it.
-What?

1:26:23.003 --> 1:26:25.789
Yeah. Yeah, let's hoop.

to Big Sean and Hit-Boy.

1:34:10.993 --> 1:34:12.864

1:36:06.195 --> 1:36:08.023
It's Rootsbackwards.

1:36:08.066 --> 1:36:09.894
