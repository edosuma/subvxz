Goblin Dogs!

01:04.120 --> 01:06.830
Goblin Dog family? Whee!

01:11.120 --> 01:15.830
Star! Star!
Will you please eat me?

01:15.830 --> 01:18.250
Don't mind if I do!

01:20.250 --> 01:22.830
Eat me now, Star.

01:22.830 --> 01:25.000
-Eat me!
-Eat all of us!

01:30.210 --> 01:33.670
Oh, blech!

01:33.670 --> 01:35.960
What a satisfying
and filling dream.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.960
MARCO: Star, are you up?

01:38.960 --> 01:40.830
It's time for breakfast!

01:40.830 --> 01:42.920
I found Captain Blanche's
Sugar Seeds here on Mewni.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.540
They have an importer.

01:44.540 --> 01:47.040
I'm all good.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.620
I just had
the most ♪ amazing ♪ dream

01:49.620 --> 01:51.000
where I was flying,

01:51.000 --> 01:52.670
and then there were
all these Goblin Dogs

01:52.670 --> 01:54.920
that were also flying,
and then I ate them.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.750
Ew. Smells like Goblin Dogs.

01:58.750 --> 02:02.040
Uh, Star,
what are all those?

02:02.040 --> 02:04.420
What the

02:04.420 --> 02:05.880
Goblin Dog wrappers?!

02:05.880 --> 02:07.080
You've been sneaking out

02:07.080 --> 02:08.580
to the Goblin Dog truck
without me?

02:08.580 --> 02:11.460
No, no, no! I swear,
I am not

02:11.460 --> 02:14.460
Ew, a receipt!

02:14.460 --> 02:17.040
I did go to that dimension!

02:19.500 --> 02:22.040
I have no idea.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.710
Okay, Marco,
you know the plan.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.210
You stay up all night and see

02:27.210 --> 02:29.540
if whatever happened last night
happens again tonight.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.880
But then what?
Shouldn't we tell
somebody about this?

02:31.880 --> 02:33.040
-I mean, what if--
-Marco!

02:33.040 --> 02:35.620
Shall I remind you
you are my squire?

02:35.620 --> 02:38.670
So I order you to sit there
and watch me sleep.

02:38.670 --> 02:40.710
-Okay.
-Good.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.710
Oh, and don't tell Tom
about this, either.

02:43.710 --> 02:45.420
Oh, heck no.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.620
Good! Good night.

02:47.670 --> 02:49.080
Aah, Glossaryck!

02:49.080 --> 02:50.380
Mm, Glabgor.

02:50.380 --> 02:54.040
All right, but just
for a little while.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.830
You're so... warm...
and cozy.

03:03.420 --> 03:07.000
-Wha! Whoa!

03:31.880 --> 03:35.580
-Star, wake up!
Hey, buddy.

03:35.580 --> 03:38.170
There's definitely
something weird going on.

03:40.380 --> 03:41.960
Marco, what happened?

03:41.960 --> 03:44.120
I might've dozed off
for a minute,

03:44.120 --> 03:45.330
but when I opened
my eyes,

03:45.330 --> 03:47.460
you had opened a portal
and gone through it.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.250
Without dimensional scissors?

03:49.250 --> 03:52.250
You came out of the portal
as that big scary thing

03:52.250 --> 03:54.580
you turned into
when you defeated Toffee.

03:54.580 --> 03:56.380
Well, that shouldn't
be happening.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.170
So, Mom! You know that big
butterfly thing

04:00.170 --> 04:02.170
you can transform
into when you get all mad

04:02.170 --> 04:03.380
and feel
like scaring people?

04:03.380 --> 04:06.250
It's not
for scaring people, Star.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.830
Right.
Right, right, right.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.620
So, does that ever happen...
unintentionally?

04:10.620 --> 04:12.250
Well, it starts
with muberty,

04:12.250 --> 04:15.330
but after that,
it requires years
of training.

04:15.330 --> 04:18.000
Oh, good.
Good, good, good.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.040
But what if it just
sort of happened...

04:21.040 --> 04:22.750
randomly?

04:22.750 --> 04:26.170
Star, it doesn't
happen randomly,

04:26.170 --> 04:29.790
okay, it happens...
in times of need,

04:29.790 --> 04:32.250
like when you
defeated Toffee.

04:32.250 --> 04:36.540
But what if it...
did happen randomly?

04:36.540 --> 04:38.670
Catastrophe!

04:38.670 --> 04:40.880
Yes!

04:40.880 --> 04:43.380
-We'd have to put you
in the dungeon!
-River--

04:43.380 --> 04:45.580
No! Then the magical
high commission would come

04:45.580 --> 04:47.040
and take you away!

04:47.040 --> 04:49.250
There'd be weeks
of examinations.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.830
You'd be locked
away forever!

04:53.210 --> 04:54.540
River, please.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.080
I mean, if this happened,

04:56.080 --> 04:59.210
eventually we'd just have
to adopt a new princess.

04:59.210 --> 05:01.040
River, enough!

05:01.040 --> 05:03.620
Star, is everything
all right?

05:03.620 --> 05:08.210
Oh! Yes. Everything is
totally normal, obviously.

05:08.210 --> 05:10.250
I was just asking
so that I can be prepared

05:10.250 --> 05:12.460
to handle it
if I ever do learn

05:12.460 --> 05:15.880
to transform like you
on purpose.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.170
Queen Moon--

05:17.170 --> 05:18.420
-Ouch!

05:18.420 --> 05:21.040
I... have nothing to say.

05:24.420 --> 05:27.040
Food truck bed transform!

05:28.500 --> 05:30.710
All right, Marco,
let's try this again.

05:36.380 --> 05:39.460
So... this'll keep you
from morphing

05:39.460 --> 05:42.460
into Butterfly Star?

05:42.460 --> 05:45.080
Yep! Don't worry,
Marco, I got this.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.040
But even your mom
seemed concerned--

05:47.040 --> 05:49.420
My parents cannot
know about this!

05:49.420 --> 05:51.080
You heard what Dad said!

05:51.080 --> 05:53.250
"Locked away forever!"

05:53.250 --> 05:55.670
I think he was
exaggerating a little.

05:55.670 --> 06:00.250
Marco, my squire,
you are the only person
I can trust with this.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.420
Promise me
you won't doze off again.

06:02.420 --> 06:04.460
Don't worry,
not gonna happen.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.460
And even if it does,
this chain will alert me

06:06.460 --> 06:09.120
any time you move,
and I'll wake up, too.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.380
Thanks, Marco.

06:10.380 --> 06:12.580
Good night.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.250
Aah! Glossaryck!

06:16.250 --> 06:17.790
Oh, no, you don't.

06:17.790 --> 06:19.920
You're not making me
fall asleep this time!

06:19.920 --> 06:22.290
Out you go.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.500
Globgor?

06:31.500 --> 06:32.880
Ohh!

06:32.880 --> 06:34.080
Huh?

06:43.960 --> 06:45.250
Star!

06:46.920 --> 06:49.250
Oh, no. Aah!

06:51.330 --> 06:53.170
Whoa! Uhh! Uhh!

06:53.170 --> 06:55.960
Huh? Aah!

06:55.960 --> 06:57.380
What the

07:02.540 --> 07:05.880
Aah! Whoa!

07:08.250 --> 07:10.500
Wha--!

07:13.210 --> 07:15.000
Star! Wake up!

07:18.040 --> 07:19.250
Marco?

07:19.250 --> 07:21.460
I need you to fly us
back to that portal!

07:21.460 --> 07:25.080
Portal? Oh...

07:31.580 --> 07:33.210
Huh?

07:34.420 --> 07:35.750
You're easily...

07:40.460 --> 07:42.210
Oh, no, no, no.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.210
What?

07:54.500 --> 07:56.750
Are you two all right?

07:56.750 --> 07:59.250
Eclypsa! I am so glad
you're here.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.080
Wait a minute.
Why are you here?

08:01.080 --> 08:04.380
I'm returning this little guy
after he wandered into my tower.

08:04.380 --> 08:06.290
Eclypsa!

08:06.290 --> 08:09.120
Isn't she
that ancient evil queen
everyone's talking about?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.670
We don't trust you
one bit!

08:10.670 --> 08:13.880
Oh, are you afraid I'll get
my evil cooties on you?

08:13.880 --> 08:15.080
Stay back, woman!

08:15.080 --> 08:16.330
What's this?

08:16.330 --> 08:18.210
Some sort of sword
hand dance?

08:18.210 --> 08:19.290
This looks fun.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.580
Don't come any closer!

08:20.580 --> 08:22.620
Marco, she's really
not dangerous.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.880
-Aren't you adorable!

08:24.880 --> 08:27.420
STAR: Stop!
I have had ten times

08:27.420 --> 08:29.210
my daily dose of weirdness
in the last hour,

08:29.210 --> 08:31.380
so let's just call it
a night, okay?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.210
What? You can't just--

08:33.210 --> 08:36.460
-Nope. No, no, no, nope, nope.
-But--!

08:38.710 --> 08:41.420
Eclypsa! Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

08:41.420 --> 08:43.250
I need to ask
you something.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.500
So,
that's about it.

08:45.500 --> 08:49.920
Every night I still go all
"Rah! Butterfly monster!"

08:49.920 --> 08:51.670
Oh, I just wish
I could stop it.

08:51.670 --> 08:53.420
Do you need to stop it?

08:53.420 --> 08:56.120
You saw what happened tonight.
It was horrible!

08:56.120 --> 08:59.250
What about the other times?
Were they so horrible?

08:59.250 --> 09:00.920
Well, no, not exactly.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.620
In fact,
they were really fun.

09:03.620 --> 09:06.330
They were actually
the most amazing dreams
I've ever had.

09:06.330 --> 09:08.420
I wouldn't run
from these dreams.

09:08.420 --> 09:09.960
I would embrace them,

09:09.960 --> 09:12.210
see where they take me.

09:12.210 --> 09:15.420
Really? You think I should
just let them happen?

09:15.420 --> 09:18.330
It's the only way to learn
what you're truly capable of.

09:18.330 --> 09:20.000
All knowledge
is good knowledge,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.330
I always say!

09:22.330 --> 09:24.380
Well, I should get back
to my tower

09:24.380 --> 09:26.290
before the guards
realize I'm missing.

09:26.290 --> 09:29.080
Oh, yeah, how did you
break out of there, anyway?

09:29.080 --> 09:30.670
I thought you were
under tower arrest.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.750
So long as we're
spilling secrets--

09:32.750 --> 09:35.750
Oh, Captain!
Permission to come aboard?

09:37.500 --> 09:39.500
What?!

09:39.500 --> 09:41.330
I never knew
that was there!

09:41.330 --> 09:45.330
Yes, I used these secret tunnels
constantly when I was your age.

09:45.330 --> 09:48.380
All knowledge
is good knowledge, my dear.

09:49.750 --> 09:53.880
Okay, so the chains
were a bust, but how about

09:53.880 --> 09:56.880
Actually, Marco, I don't need
you to watch me tonight.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.380
Oh! Did you figure out
how to stop transforming?

10:00.380 --> 10:03.500
No, but I thought
maybe I should see

10:03.500 --> 10:06.460
what I'm capable of,
or whatever.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.960
Star, you don't know
anything about this.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.750
Yeah, and I'll never know
anything about it

10:11.750 --> 10:14.120
if I keep trying
to stop it.

10:14.120 --> 10:18.290
I know it's weird,
but I really need
to see this through, okay?

10:18.290 --> 10:21.170
Okay, I guess, but could
you at least take

10:21.170 --> 10:22.790
my dimensional scissors
with you

10:22.790 --> 10:24.750
in case you get trapped?

10:24.750 --> 10:30.380
Sorry, Marco,
but if I'm gonna do this,
I can't do it halfway.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.250
Okay, fine!
I tried to help!

10:33.250 --> 10:35.170
No one can say
I didn't try!

10:35.170 --> 10:37.380
Because I tried.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.710
So if you die out there,

10:39.710 --> 10:41.750
don't go blaming me,
all right?

10:41.750 --> 10:43.540
- All right!
- All right!

10:43.540 --> 10:46.880
Well...
good luck out there.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.750
Globgor.

11:05.750 --> 11:10.040
Yeah, Gloss, I'm not sure she
can do this alone, either.
