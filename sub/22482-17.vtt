WEBVTT

00:06.571 --> 00:08.965
Really? That's how
you're gonna do it?

00:09.009 --> 00:11.489
Wendy, she's a prison nurse,

00:11.533 --> 00:14.144
which means she can kick
your ass and bandage you up.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.452
Not properly.

00:19.106 --> 00:22.196
Follow my finger,
follow my finger.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.849
What are you looking for?

00:23.893 --> 00:26.330
I don't know.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.940
I'm fine.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.073
I think I just took
a clog to the head.

00:30.117 --> 00:33.424
I'm sorry.
They help me with my back pain.

00:33.468 --> 00:38.081
And it wasn't my fault,
someone hit me with Wendy.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.561
Oh, my God, my watch.

00:39.604 --> 00:42.651
My watch.
Someone stole my watch!

00:42.694 --> 00:45.306
Oh wait, I hid it in my bra.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.309
Is everyone all right?

00:48.352 --> 00:50.615
No, her arm is broken.

00:50.659 --> 00:51.703
It's not broken.

00:51.747 --> 00:54.054
It's just
poorly bandaged.

00:54.097 --> 00:57.100
We were just trying
to help some alcoholics.

00:58.319 --> 01:00.582
Oh, hey.
Anyone lose an earring?

01:00.625 --> 01:03.193
Ah! It's a tooth!

01:03.237 --> 01:05.239
♪

01:21.864 --> 01:24.432
Can you tell me exactly
what happened here?

01:24.475 --> 01:26.825
[all talking at once]

01:26.869 --> 01:28.479
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:28.523 --> 01:29.567
One at a time, please.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.352
Okay, okay.

01:31.395 --> 01:34.920
I organized an AA meeting
for your inmates

01:34.964 --> 01:38.707
and we were all very excited
to be here this afternoon.

01:38.750 --> 01:41.884
Oh, God, why do we
have to do this?

01:41.927 --> 01:43.712
Adam and I had plans.

01:43.755 --> 01:44.800
To do what?

01:44.843 --> 01:46.280
Anything but this.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.064
And how did I get roped
into driving?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.197
I should be in the back seat
studying for the LSATs.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.155
Hmm. Trust me,
you do not want be crammed

01:52.199 --> 01:53.722
in this little back seat.

01:53.765 --> 01:56.681
It's like a Red Bull graveyard
back here.

01:56.725 --> 01:59.989
Or as I like to call it,
sober cocaine.

02:00.032 --> 02:02.600
Why didn't we
take your car?

02:02.644 --> 02:05.386
It's roomy and it has
the Broadway Channel.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.779
Those crooks see me
pull up in my Range Rover,

02:07.823 --> 02:10.086
next thing you know I'm
a hostage with a torn blouse

02:10.130 --> 02:13.785
doing whatever
it takes to survive.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.048
Go on.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.617
Jill, there's guards
in the room.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.576
We'll be fine.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.969
There will be guards,
right, Marjorie?

02:24.013 --> 02:27.886
Yes, and we all agreed
to do this panel months ago.

02:27.930 --> 02:31.368
Only because you're old
and we assumed you'd forget.

02:31.412 --> 02:32.717
Mom, I'll give you
a hundred bucks

02:32.761 --> 02:33.979
if you remember
our phone number.

02:35.938 --> 02:39.985
Five... something.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.901
I just don't know
what I have to offer.

02:42.945 --> 02:45.469
A bunch of convicts aren't
gonna relate to my story:

02:45.513 --> 02:48.385
some rich bitch who went to four
fancy rehabs to get sober.

02:48.429 --> 02:49.952
It's just gonna make 'em angry.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.910
It makes me angry.

02:51.954 --> 02:55.000
Look, it's important to share
our recovery with these women.

02:55.044 --> 02:58.221
The first meeting I ever went to
was when I was in prison.

02:58.265 --> 03:01.006
Who knows, you can change
someone's life today.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.792
Or we could assume their lives
are fine and just go home.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.402
I'm excited
to talk to them.

03:05.446 --> 03:08.362
I even came up with a few
jokes to break the ice.

03:08.405 --> 03:11.582
So these two serial
killers are in a canoe...Stop.

03:11.626 --> 03:15.543
I am not getting shivved because
you want to be Jimmy Kimmel.

03:15.586 --> 03:18.110
You don't get "shivved,"
you get "shanked.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.243
A shiv is a thing
you get shanked with.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.202
You get shanked with a shiv.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.249
ANDREA:
Excuse me.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.425
Can you move
the story along?

03:28.469 --> 03:31.341
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to give you context.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.560
JILL:
Marjorie,

03:32.603 --> 03:34.431
let me take it from here.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.346
We arrived, ate a bowl

03:36.390 --> 03:38.130
of something gray
with cornbread.

03:38.174 --> 03:41.046
Then we started the panel
for the inmates.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.700
Wendy bombed with her jokes.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.268
Hey, they were
starting to warm up.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.618
Someone spit on you.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.491
Then Christy did her usual

03:50.534 --> 03:52.493
"hate my mom,
gonna be a lawyer" deal,

03:52.536 --> 03:54.364
then it was my turn
to share my story.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.975
Which wasn't your story at all.

03:57.019 --> 04:00.544
All right, I may have gotten off
to a rocky start.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.329
I'm not gonna lie,

04:02.372 --> 04:04.418
it's just so hard being poor.

04:04.461 --> 04:07.072
Jugglin' four jobs

04:07.116 --> 04:10.424
at four different job places.

04:13.470 --> 04:16.125
Okay, even I didn't believe
what I just said.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.736
Truth is, I'm rich.
Like, "I don't even know

04:18.780 --> 04:22.523
how much a loaf
of bread costs" rich. [sighs]

04:22.566 --> 04:24.786
But all that money
couldn't keep me from using.

04:24.829 --> 04:28.050
I recently threw away
three years of sobriety.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.922
I was drinking in every room
of my big, fancy house,

04:30.966 --> 04:33.360
including the gym.

04:33.403 --> 04:34.883
It's real hard to crash
a stationary bike,

04:34.926 --> 04:36.232
but it can be done.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.540
Now I've got
a little over a month

04:39.583 --> 04:42.064
and I'm holding on
for dear life.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.066
I'm not sure if that makes sense
to any of you,

04:44.109 --> 04:45.894
but that's my story.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.417
Thank you.

04:50.986 --> 04:53.554
Shoulda skipped the
part about the gym.

04:53.597 --> 04:56.426
Why? They got
a gym here.

04:56.470 --> 05:00.212
First, let me apologize for
Wendy's "captive audience" joke.

05:00.256 --> 05:02.432
She doesn't get out much.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.174
Well, probably more than you.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.089
[laughter]

05:07.132 --> 05:08.873
That's how it's done.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.399
Anyway, I'm Bonnie
and I'm an alcoholic.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.488
INMATES:
Hi, Bonnie.Bonnie Plunkett?

05:15.402 --> 05:17.142
You ruined my life!

05:17.186 --> 05:18.840
[screams]

05:18.883 --> 05:20.798
Code three, rec room.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.147
Oh, God.[indistinct shouting]

05:22.191 --> 05:23.932
Oh, my God! I'm gonna die

05:23.975 --> 05:26.064
in a women's prison!

05:26.108 --> 05:29.285
Well, how do you know
Tammy Diffendorf?

05:29.329 --> 05:32.419
I don't. I have never
seen her before in my life.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.290
But she knew your name

05:34.334 --> 05:36.118
and said she wanted
to kill you.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.250
My mom gets that more often
than you think.

05:40.383 --> 05:41.993
Do you want to press charges?

05:43.604 --> 05:45.867
Would there be
any monetary compensation

05:45.910 --> 05:47.477
for my pain and suffering?

05:47.521 --> 05:48.783
No.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.654
Pass.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.573
37 years I've been doing
these panels,

05:56.617 --> 05:58.836
never once have I been hit
with a chair.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.665
[scoffs] Are you implying
this is my fault?

06:01.709 --> 06:03.885
She didn't threaten to kill me.

06:03.928 --> 06:07.410
She would if she knew you.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.064
You really don't
remember who she is?

06:09.107 --> 06:10.674
I'm telling you,
I don't know her.

06:10.718 --> 06:14.069
Tammy Diffendorf is
not a name you forget.

06:14.112 --> 06:16.637
Maybe she's someone
from your drug days.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.422
Everyone who wants to kill me
is from my drug days.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.424
No, they're not.

06:23.426 --> 06:26.081
Hopefully, we managed
to do some good

06:26.124 --> 06:28.039
before the riot broke out.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.998
I think my story
touched people.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.434
I saw a few tears.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.218
Those were tattoos.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.483
I think they really connected

06:36.526 --> 06:38.049
with your story, Christy:

06:38.093 --> 06:40.530
ex-stripper studying
to be a lawyer.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.880
They did, didn't they?

06:42.924 --> 06:45.535
Like if they were to make
a movie of my life,

06:45.579 --> 06:48.495
that scene would definitely be
in the trailer.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.193
Well, I'm glad you all had
such a wonderful time.

06:51.236 --> 06:54.152
Meanwhile, some maniac named
Tammy is running around

06:54.196 --> 06:57.460
with my DNA
under her fingernails.

06:57.504 --> 07:01.072
Tammy... Tammy...

07:01.116 --> 07:03.945
Who the hell is Tammy?

07:06.643 --> 07:08.732
Tammy. Tammy.

07:08.776 --> 07:12.040
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy,
Tammy, Tammy.
Mom.

07:13.345 --> 07:14.695
I've got an idea.

07:14.738 --> 07:17.524
You say the name "Tammy"
500 more times,

07:17.567 --> 07:19.395
I'm gonna go thank
my lucky stars

07:19.439 --> 07:20.962
for a toilet with a seat.

07:23.443 --> 07:27.751
Tammy... Tammy... Tammy.

07:31.842 --> 07:35.759
Tammy... Tammy.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.460
[muffled]:
Tammy.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.421
Guys, I had a major breakthrough
at the meeting today.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.292
I mean, it was like
a thunderbolt.

07:47.336 --> 07:50.121
Every mistake I've ever made
in my life is because...

07:50.165 --> 07:52.384
Oh, my God! Tammy.

07:52.428 --> 07:53.908
I was talking.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.213
I know, and thank you.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.911
That's when I do
my best thinking.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.572
So you remember?

08:05.615 --> 08:07.095
Yes, I don't know
if it's the coffee

08:07.138 --> 08:08.705
or me not wanting
to hear Wendy's story,

08:08.749 --> 08:10.533
but it's finally
coming back to me.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.579
Maybe we should
let Wendy finish.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.189
Oh, come on, Marjorie.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.017
A gigantic woman
tackled Bonnie.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.715
Tell me you don't want to hear
the "who," "what," "why."

08:18.759 --> 08:21.326
I think I may have mentioned
in passing

08:21.370 --> 08:22.980
that I was in foster care.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.374
Nah.
Stop.
No, really?
You?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.071
Anyway, when I was 14,

08:27.115 --> 08:28.551
I got placed
with a family in Vallejo.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.293
Ew. Vallejo?
Sounds dusty.

08:31.336 --> 08:34.122
I'd been bouncing from one
crap hole to another for years,

08:34.165 --> 08:36.385
but this new place
was actually decent.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.518
I had my own room
for the first time.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.215
I could drink, smoke dope,

08:40.258 --> 08:41.999
sneak boys in
through the window,

08:42.043 --> 08:44.741
but then they took in
this other girl.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.355
Tammy?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.315
Tammy.

08:53.358 --> 08:56.579
She had these adorable
French braids.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.799
She did her homework
every night.

08:58.842 --> 09:01.323
She helped around the house
with the chores.

09:01.366 --> 09:04.456
She was polite, considerate,
cheerful.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.937
I hated her guts.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.984
Having Little Miss Perfect
around

09:10.027 --> 09:11.594
was screwing my sweet deal.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.031
I had to find a way to bring her
to the dark side.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.598
Turns out, I'm really good

09:15.642 --> 09:17.426
at bringing people
to the dark side.

09:17.469 --> 09:20.690
Stop.
No. Really?
What?

09:20.734 --> 09:22.736
Anyway, she had this boyfriend,

09:22.779 --> 09:24.694
another straight-A,
goody-two-shoes nerd.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.696
But the nerd had a penis,
and that made him weak.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.568
So,

09:28.611 --> 09:30.482
I had my friend Donna--
very chesty,

09:30.526 --> 09:32.746
lots of tube tops,
she's dead now--

09:32.789 --> 09:35.792
I had her make out with him
behind the gym

09:35.836 --> 09:39.056
just as I innocently walked
Tammy around the corner.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.624
Oh, she was devastated.

09:41.668 --> 09:45.367
Luckily, I had the
perfect thing to comfort her.

09:48.675 --> 09:52.026
BONNIE:
Wanna get away?

09:53.331 --> 09:55.420
Before I knew it,

09:55.464 --> 09:57.553
Tammy went bad girl
in a big way.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.294
Even I was impressed. She was

09:59.337 --> 10:00.904
wakin' and bakin',
flunkin' tests,

10:00.948 --> 10:02.732
buying vodka from the janitor.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.604
Pfft. A month later,
she was gone.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.083
[laughs]

10:06.127 --> 10:09.347
Ah, misty watercolored memories.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.829
So, who wants
to split a chef's salad?

10:14.918 --> 10:17.051
What?

10:17.094 --> 10:19.227
A whole salad
makes me bloaty.

10:19.270 --> 10:22.404
Bonnie, you do realize

10:22.447 --> 10:25.973
what you did to
Tammy was wrong--

10:26.016 --> 10:29.716
although impressively
complex for a 14-year-old.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.936
Mm. Not that impressive.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.112
14-year-olds
are pure evil.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.854
I spent three semesters
taking down an art teacher.

10:37.898 --> 10:42.206
Tell me my horse painting
was unrealistic.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.469
What is it with
janitors and vodka?

10:44.513 --> 10:46.733
Our junior high janitor
didn't have a hand,

10:46.776 --> 10:49.605
but he always
had vodka.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.696
Are you saying
it's my fault she's in jail?

10:53.740 --> 10:55.742
No, I didn't say that.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.613
Then what are you saying,
Marjorie?

10:59.354 --> 11:02.139
May I?Yes. I'm so tired of this.

11:06.622 --> 11:09.756
"And so, I-I'd like
to make amends

11:09.799 --> 11:12.672
"for those terrible things
I did to you

11:12.715 --> 11:14.978
"when we were both struggling

11:15.022 --> 11:19.026
with the challenges
of the foster care system."

11:19.069 --> 11:21.855
That's it?

11:21.898 --> 11:25.162
That's all I prepared,
but I could riff a little.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.729
You're unbelievable.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.644
Thank you,
but I can't take full credit.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.691
I've learned a lot from the
program, but most of it is me.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.041
Screw your program.
I only went to that meeting

11:34.084 --> 11:36.521
to get away from my
masturbating cellmate.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.133
Talk about addiction.

11:39.176 --> 11:42.049
Is she top bunk, or bottom bunk?

11:42.092 --> 11:44.747
I-I don't know why I asked that.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.750
Let me get this straight.
You drove all the way out here

11:47.794 --> 11:49.926
to apologize to me
for handing me a joint

11:49.970 --> 11:51.406
and messing around
with my boyfriend?

11:51.449 --> 11:54.191
Technically, that was Donna,
may she rest in peace.

11:54.235 --> 11:57.717
Oh, she's dead? Good.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.371
Now when are you gonna apologize
for what you reallydid to me?

12:00.415 --> 12:02.547
Well, um, I was hoping

12:02.591 --> 12:05.681
my apology was, uh, more
of a blanket type deal,

12:05.725 --> 12:07.596
but if there are specifics,

12:07.639 --> 12:09.772
I could tackle them
on a case-by-case basis.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.687
You got me kicked
out of that house!

12:11.731 --> 12:13.210
No, no, you got kicked out

12:13.254 --> 12:14.603
'cause you stole
our foster father's wallet.

12:14.646 --> 12:15.909
No, youstole his wallet

12:15.952 --> 12:18.259
and planted it
in my book bag.
Oh.

12:18.302 --> 12:22.437
Ooh. Yeah.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.527
They kicked me out and
put me in a group home.

12:25.570 --> 12:28.356
It was hell, so I took off.

12:28.399 --> 12:31.576
I was 14 years old,
living on the street,

12:31.620 --> 12:33.883
doing stuff I didn't even
know I was capable of.

12:33.927 --> 12:37.104
Aw, Tammy, I'm so sorry.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.236
Yeah, well, "sorry"
doesn't help me, does it?

12:39.280 --> 12:42.413
'Cause you're out
there, and I'm in here.

12:42.457 --> 12:45.547
I spent the last 40 years
wishing I never met you.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.115
Guard?

12:54.730 --> 12:58.429
I'm so upset
about what I did to this woman.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.475
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.956
I'm haunted, like the guy
who hears his own heart

13:02.999 --> 13:05.088
through the wall
in that Stephen King book.

13:05.132 --> 13:07.090
Like she read a book.BONNIE:
I'm telling you

13:07.134 --> 13:09.963
it's been a nightmare.Like she has a heart.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.095
You know, a week ago,

13:12.139 --> 13:14.619
I couldn't even remember
who this woman was.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.491
Turns out I ruined her life.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.928
Makes me wonder
how many other peoples' lives

13:18.972 --> 13:21.801
I might have ruined.

13:22.932 --> 13:26.283
That I don't know of.

13:27.632 --> 13:30.853
Anyway, made my amends,
totally tanked.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.942
Just wish there was
something else I could do.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.467
Happy to be sober,
where every day

13:36.511 --> 13:38.861
I get to discover
new ways I'm terrible.

13:41.472 --> 13:42.909
Anyone else
like to share?

13:42.952 --> 13:45.128
I'll go.
Christy, alcoholic.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.826
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.916
First of all, the book
my mother was referring to was

13:49.959 --> 13:52.440
The Telltale Heart
by Edgar Allan Poe.

13:52.483 --> 13:55.269
I liked it better
when she was stupid.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.967
I bitch about my life
in this room a lot,

13:58.011 --> 14:03.364
but after visiting that prison,
I got to say, I feel lucky.

14:03.407 --> 14:06.628
I met women in there doing time
for things I've done.

14:06.671 --> 14:09.500
I just didn't get caught.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.938
It's funny.
Getting into law school

14:11.981 --> 14:14.201
has been such a pain in the ass.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.856
I was starting to wonder
if it was worth it.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.596
But if some day,

14:18.640 --> 14:22.644
I get to help just one
of these women, I know it is.

14:24.515 --> 14:28.084
Who knows? Maybe I can devote
my entire practice

14:28.128 --> 14:29.999
to people my mother destroyed.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.699
But will I hear a thank you?

14:41.968 --> 14:45.058
Hey, there she is!

14:45.101 --> 14:47.277
They said you have
a prepaid phone card for me?

14:47.321 --> 14:49.932
And six pairs of underwear
in various styles.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.760
If you're not a thong girl,

14:51.803 --> 14:53.544
perhaps you could
barter them for snacks.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.809
Hi. I'm her daughter Christy.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.595
Man, how much did you smoke?

15:02.423 --> 15:04.773
In her defense,
she didn't know she was pregnant

15:04.816 --> 15:06.427
till I fell out of her.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.385
We're not here
to talk about me.

15:08.429 --> 15:10.257
Now, I went
to the prison officials

15:10.300 --> 15:13.434
and explained your attack on me
was totally justified.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.957
You get me my
privileges back?

15:15.001 --> 15:16.306
No. They laughed at me.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.308
Actually, they were
kind of mean about it.

15:18.352 --> 15:21.311
And a little condescending.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.923
Be sure to give the
prison a bad Yelp review.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.707
Are we done here?

15:25.750 --> 15:28.275
No. The reason I brought
my daughter is she's a lawyer.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.103
Not a lawyer, not yet.

15:30.146 --> 15:33.280
But I know one, and he's agreed
to take a look at your case.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.759
Yeah, we thought
we could see

15:34.803 --> 15:36.892
if there was a way
we could get you out early.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.938
Oh, that's great because
I totally didn't mean

15:38.981 --> 15:41.244
to kill those
people and eat them.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.116
What?

15:43.159 --> 15:45.248
Kidding. I robbed an
Outback Steakhouse.

15:45.292 --> 15:48.425
Just my luck, it was
"Cops Eat Free" night.

15:48.469 --> 15:52.386
I was arrested
by 32 people.

15:52.429 --> 15:56.956
Okay, well, did any of them
get a little grabby?

15:56.999 --> 15:59.219
This is our time.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.395
I was tripping balls
on mushrooms, sweetie.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.918
I got no idea.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.398
So, are we done?

16:04.441 --> 16:06.704
Uh, yeah.
Guess so.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.317
Tammy?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.493
Listen, I-I know
you hate my mom,

16:12.536 --> 16:14.495
and you have every right to,

16:14.538 --> 16:18.194
but you should know
she genuinely feels terrible,

16:18.238 --> 16:20.588
and now
she's a really good person.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.461
Well, she's a better person.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.421
She's a person.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.292
Let's go, Christy.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.338
Hey, Plunkett?
BOTH:
Yeah.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.122
Not you, Cigarette Baby.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.957
Those people we lived with--
they end up adopting you?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.568
Hell, no. I got kicked out
two weeks after you did.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.049
Stole her wallet,
had no one to blame it on.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.704
Where'd you end up?Chicken farm in Bakersfield.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.706
Even worse than it sounds.

16:51.749 --> 16:54.926
We actually had it pretty good
at that house, didn't we?

16:54.970 --> 16:57.146
Ugh. Yeah, they were
nice people.

16:57.190 --> 17:01.063
And they had no idea
what marijuana smelled like.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.370
[laughing]:
I know, right?
What did you tell them?

17:03.413 --> 17:06.547
There was a family of skunks
living under the house?

17:06.590 --> 17:08.375
[laughing]:
Oh, yeah.

17:08.418 --> 17:11.421
And they followed me
to school one time.
Right.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.075
[laughs]

17:13.119 --> 17:15.686
Wait. Do you still draw?
What?

17:15.730 --> 17:19.038
You used to draw all those crazy
snakes everywhere, you know.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.431
On walls, inside
cereal boxes.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.781
I forgot about that.
Remember I drew one on the neck

17:23.825 --> 17:25.696
of that crazy red-headed guy
when he was asleep?

17:25.740 --> 17:28.090
What was his name?I don't remember, man.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.831
He was psycho.
Oh, my God.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.833
No one home
in those eyes.
Mm-hmm.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.400
Ooh. Good in bed, though.

17:33.443 --> 17:35.271
Yeah, he was.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.106
You call it "tequila"?
I call it "to-kill-ya."

17:44.150 --> 17:46.543
[laughs]
You feel me, right, ma'am?

17:48.197 --> 17:50.852
Where are you from?

17:50.895 --> 17:53.811
[quietly]:
They're not gonna laugh.
Sit down.

17:55.204 --> 17:58.164
All right,
you've been great.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.253
[weak applause]

18:00.296 --> 18:02.429
It's nice they let us come back.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.561
You ever stop to think

18:04.605 --> 18:07.477
that maybe we're part
of their punishment?

18:07.521 --> 18:10.480
Hi. I'm Bonnie,
and I'm an alcoholic.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.916
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.179
Bonnie Plunkett?!

18:13.222 --> 18:15.355
Uh-oh.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.009
Oh!
I remember this one.
It's bad. It's really bad!
