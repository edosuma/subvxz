<i>Vital signs are stable.</i>

01:09.653 --> 01:11.207
<i>You scared us, Sam.</i>

01:11.286 --> 01:13.521
<i>We thought you were
losing the will to live.</i>

01:13.855 --> 01:16.059
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

01:20.150 --> 01:22.941
<i>This just my mind,
trying to keep me here.</i>

01:24.875 --> 01:26.413
I'm here.

01:27.286 --> 01:31.471
<i>Help me.
What should I do, Annie?</i>

01:31.869 --> 01:33.074
<i>Stay.</i>

02:00.663 --> 02:01.852
Real.

02:04.246 --> 02:05.578
Unreal.

02:08.186 --> 02:09.328
Real.

02:12.071 --> 02:13.356
Unreal.

02:31.153 --> 02:34.060
- Get back here!
- Right behind you, boss!

02:48.768 --> 02:50.101
Sorry, love.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.413
You're under arrest, Trent!

03:07.544 --> 03:08.890
What were you gonna do?

03:09.003 --> 03:11.016
Jump in the canal
and swim for freedom?

03:11.776 --> 03:13.429
Get off him!

03:14.254 --> 03:15.894
He's got a verucca!

03:27.044 --> 03:30.925
Kim Trent, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of armed robbery.

03:30.956 --> 03:33.385
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your...

03:33.465 --> 03:36.371
No, that's not it, is it?

03:36.571 --> 03:38.771
You have the right
to remain silent...

03:38.971 --> 03:40.544
You're nicked!

03:46.774 --> 03:48.653
There's no badge down there,
Sammy-boy.

03:48.853 --> 03:52.107
Mind you, does tickle
open a few doors, eh?

03:53.065 --> 03:54.172
Come on!

04:16.822 --> 04:18.680
<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

04:18.803 --> 04:21.726
<i>I had an accident
and I woke up in 1973.</i>

04:21.826 --> 04:25.295
<i>Am i mad? In a coma?
Or back in time?</i>

04:25.419 --> 04:28.763
<i>Whatever's happened, it's like
I've landed on a different planet.</i>

04:28.911 --> 04:32.479
<i>Now maybe if I can work out
a reason, I can get home.</i>

05:22.849 --> 05:26.223
Give us me clothes, a brew
and a bun, if you'd be so kind.

05:27.062 --> 05:29.648
- Nice play, guv.
- This is an abortion of justice.

05:29.768 --> 05:32.464
Chris, get on the blower
to C Division, D Division,

05:32.495 --> 05:34.780
tell 'em all that Hunt says
they couldn't catch a cold.

05:34.860 --> 05:37.074
We got
ourselves Kim Trent.

05:37.194 --> 05:38.766
Might pin a medal
on your chest.

05:38.846 --> 05:39.833
Never thought of that.

05:39.926 --> 05:41.953
Enjoy it while it lasts, boys,

05:42.380 --> 05:44.392
'cause this is fantasy time.

05:45.206 --> 05:47.673
- Phyllis, where d'you want this one?
- Number two.

05:47.820 --> 05:49.338
You can't put him in there.

05:49.384 --> 05:51.112
Two pints of vomit
in there this morning.

05:51.192 --> 05:53.472
Oh, didn't know you were
running the desk, Nelson.

05:53.645 --> 05:56.111
Come on, you can't put him in
with the carrot chunks.

05:56.204 --> 05:58.857
He'd be delighted
to go to interview though.

05:58.951 --> 06:00.510
Cell two.

06:14.802 --> 06:17.161
Right. Sam.

06:19.721 --> 06:21.468
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

06:21.960 --> 06:22.853
Okay.

06:23.387 --> 06:25.894
Bookmakers in Baker Road,
two days ago.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.119
Â£836 taken from the safe.

06:29.226 --> 06:32.186
Tasty haul. Best of luck to them,
whoever they are.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.451
Not me.

06:33.705 --> 06:36.012
I'm just back in Manchester
to visit relatives.

06:36.119 --> 06:39.198
If you were Pinocchio,
you'd have just poked my eye out.

06:42.794 --> 06:46.433
You've been spotted recently
with your known accomplices.

06:46.953 --> 06:50.058
Gordon Bricks, aka "Brixter",

06:50.232 --> 06:51.592
and Freddy Wilson.

06:51.698 --> 06:53.365
Now, we have reason
to suspect

06:53.432 --> 06:55.897
you three carried out
the Baker Road job on Saturday.

06:56.004 --> 06:57.617
I like your manners.

06:59.470 --> 07:00.962
You think this is funny?

07:04.749 --> 07:06.188
Look at these.

07:08.735 --> 07:11.148
These people were
beaten and kicked.

07:11.268 --> 07:13.454
This woman is in her sixties.

07:14.454 --> 07:18.093
This bloke was whipped
with knotted rope

07:18.173 --> 07:20.360
while he unlocked the safe.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.025
We know you did it, Kim.

07:25.372 --> 07:27.199
So who were you
meeting at the baths?

07:27.265 --> 07:28.731
Wilson and
Brixter?

07:28.811 --> 07:31.291
Planning one last blag
before you go?

07:31.398 --> 07:33.504
Doing the front crawl
ain't a crime, Mr Hunt.

07:33.610 --> 07:36.463
- You were born, that's the crime.
- Where's the next robbery?

07:37.850 --> 07:39.383
Just tell us.

07:40.996 --> 07:43.383
Look. I admit it.

07:44.023 --> 07:45.409
I got form.

07:46.662 --> 07:50.076
But honestly boys, I'm just up here
to see my auntie.

07:50.609 --> 07:51.809
Liar.

07:54.555 --> 07:57.314
Can you account for
your whereabouts last Saturday?

07:57.395 --> 07:59.208
Cookery classes.

07:59.581 --> 08:01.474
I'm having it off with
Fanny Craddock.

08:05.808 --> 08:08.047
Snooker tournament!

08:08.500 --> 08:09.900
Feeding the ducks!

08:11.873 --> 08:12.952
Pictures!

08:13.286 --> 08:15.206
You got nothing!

08:21.297 --> 08:23.536
We found this
about your person.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.510
Bookies always keep
a big float on a major race day

08:26.644 --> 08:29.075
and they get the bank to mark
the notes, don't they, Kimmy?

08:29.151 --> 08:32.297
We know
you pinched this dough.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.615
There you go.

08:35.855 --> 08:38.895
What a surprise.
Didn't see that coming.

08:39.109 --> 08:41.895
I've never seen that money
before in my life!

08:44.896 --> 08:45.815
Guv?

08:47.001 --> 08:48.548
Can I have a word?

08:52.480 --> 08:53.894
What are you playing at?

08:54.440 --> 08:57.013
Those notes
aren't from the bookies.

08:57.853 --> 09:00.240
Worth a punt though.
Look.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.119
When Trent and
his boys hit the city,

09:02.199 --> 09:04.759
it's always a couple of jobs,
bang bang, in, out.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.177
They've done one, we can
stop them doing the other.

09:07.300 --> 09:10.214
- Great, a fit-up.
- Cells!

09:10.444 --> 09:12.946
I'm just trying to keep things mov...
does it matter?!

09:13.835 --> 09:15.999
I'm not going back in that cell,
it stinks.

09:16.060 --> 09:18.116
- Put us in another one.
- I'll tell you what.

09:18.178 --> 09:20.279
I'll have a little think about that
while you think

09:20.371 --> 09:23.317
about where Freddy and Brixter
are hiding, okay?

09:28.412 --> 09:32.048
Nothing puts things right
quite like a punch, does it?

09:35.775 --> 09:38.307
<i>That's the second time
this morning it's slipped off.</i>

09:38.399 --> 09:40.486
<i>I can't tell Frank
it doesn't fit.</i>

09:40.569 --> 09:42.549
<i>Gorgeous though, isn't it?</i>

09:42.929 --> 09:45.799
Can one of you clean out cell two?
It's disgusting in there.

09:45.906 --> 09:49.956
We don't do cells,
WPCs do cells, sorry.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.686
Yeah, of course not.
Thanks.

09:52.778 --> 09:56.937
Well, I might be able to splash
a bit of Dettol in there later.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.440
Is that alright, sir?

09:58.609 --> 10:00.113
Yeah, that's..

10:00.389 --> 10:03.595
- You're a diamond. What's your...
- June.

10:06.047 --> 10:08.640
I'd take that back to the jewellers
if I were you.

10:11.725 --> 10:13.428
Well, that was fun.

10:13.566 --> 10:16.159
What shall we do later,
take a cattle prod to his testes?

10:16.220 --> 10:18.676
Alright, he called our bluff.
The money didn't work.

10:18.722 --> 10:20.777
You could try nailing him
with some real evidence.

10:20.854 --> 10:25.104
You wanna see evidence that will
secure us a real conviction?

10:27.344 --> 10:29.278
Aladdin's cave.

10:31.486 --> 10:33.880
There's 200 quid's worth
of drugs here.

10:33.942 --> 10:39.312
We plant them on him, watch him
grow into a big flower of justice.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.366
For God's sake, guv...

10:42.271 --> 10:45.049
- Let's not resort to this.
- Gotta charge him today, Sam.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.288
Gotta keep
that bloke off the streets.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.756
- This place is like Guantanamo Bay.
- Give over, it's nothing like Spain.

10:50.863 --> 10:52.229
I'm not letting Trent go.

10:52.290 --> 10:53.946
No, the judge'll do that,
at the trial.

10:54.023 --> 10:56.080
Don't have much faith in us,
do you, pal?

10:57.920 --> 10:59.946
Gary Cooper nearly
come down then!

11:00.053 --> 11:02.263
You want to kick a ball about,
do it in the corridor!

11:02.340 --> 11:03.934
Sorry guv.

11:05.285 --> 11:06.650
Go on then.

11:07.019 --> 11:09.427
How do you do this
where you come from?

11:10.256 --> 11:11.683
Where I come from?

11:11.729 --> 11:14.674
Yeah, Hyde, your old division,
you brain donor.

11:15.564 --> 11:18.603
Well, in "Hyde",

11:18.970 --> 11:22.004
we don't traditionally keep
acid and knocked-off bling

11:22.096 --> 11:24.033
in our offices
just so we could get home early.

11:24.061 --> 11:27.022
- So you wouldn't have pulled him in?
- Not without evidence.

11:27.068 --> 11:29.723
Not even if you knew people out there
were in real danger?

11:29.785 --> 11:31.564
People are always in danger, guv.

11:31.656 --> 11:34.219
One minute you're going about
your business, the next, bang!

11:34.295 --> 11:35.630
taken out by a speeding car.

11:35.691 --> 11:40.493
Well, I've taken that speeding car
off the road. For good.

11:54.582 --> 11:56.362
Have you got a lawyer?

12:07.487 --> 12:09.619
See you back here tomorrow.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.856
When we've
got more evidence.

12:13.179 --> 12:14.437
Tatty-bye.

12:28.894 --> 12:30.981
It was an unsafe conviction.

12:33.251 --> 12:34.862
I'll level with you, guv.

12:35.261 --> 12:37.301
I don't know how long
I'm gonna be here.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.866
But while I am...

12:42.273 --> 12:45.187
But when we get him,
it'll be watertight.

12:45.893 --> 12:48.393
And I tell you, I'll be the first
to crack open the Scotch.

12:48.470 --> 12:51.140
Are they all like you in Hyde?

12:54.981 --> 12:57.636
Must be a bloody
dangerous place.

13:06.267 --> 13:08.339
Can we do this
somewhere else, boss?

13:08.400 --> 13:09.735
Ignore them.

13:11.177 --> 13:13.033
Chris. Look at me.

13:13.187 --> 13:14.890
I'm still your DI on this.

13:14.967 --> 13:18.403
Now, we're gonna re-interview
the staff in the bookies at Baker Road,

13:18.465 --> 13:20.919
so, make a list of
who we're seeing before.

13:21.471 --> 13:24.555
- Drag 'em back in, right?
- "Dragging" is not necessary.

13:24.663 --> 13:26.535
We'll talk to them there.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.744
"Talk.. there."

13:31.476 --> 13:33.223
If you bring people
into the station,

13:33.224 --> 13:35.134
they just freak out,
they don't think clearly.

13:35.242 --> 13:39.093
But we don't want them thinking
clearly. We wanna trip 'em up.

13:39.967 --> 13:41.947
Chris, these are not suspects.

13:42.069 --> 13:45.015
These are witnesses
to an armed robbery.

13:45.184 --> 13:46.258
Yeah.

13:47.501 --> 13:52.626
"Witnesses... not... suspects".

13:52.811 --> 13:55.035
There. Big letters.

13:56.538 --> 14:00.834
And get IDs on Trent,
Brixter and Wilson.

14:00.972 --> 14:06.050
Get the faces out to stations,
bus depots... even airports.

14:06.157 --> 14:08.459
You know, go national.
Heathrow.

14:08.567 --> 14:11.803
- Where's that?
- Heathrow? London.

14:11.926 --> 14:13.644
London Airport?

14:13.829 --> 14:15.624
But that's not in our district.

14:16.130 --> 14:18.523
Just get the faces out there.

14:22.205 --> 14:23.202
What?

14:23.356 --> 14:26.394
Why've you put tapioca pudding
on your beefburger?

14:29.018 --> 14:30.951
Thought it was horseradish.

14:31.166 --> 14:35.001
Tyler! Blag in progress, jewellers,
Bitman Road, move it!

14:48.436 --> 14:49.892
Where's plod?

14:50.921 --> 14:54.481
Oi, oi, oi, drop it!
Get on your knees!

14:54.726 --> 14:56.060
Get down!

15:07.036 --> 15:08.924
- See a car?
- No.

15:09.425 --> 15:10.776
You breathing?

15:10.945 --> 15:13.905
- Almost, yeah. You?
- Yeah.

15:23.852 --> 15:27.504
- Oh god.
- June...

15:28.102 --> 15:30.353
Keep hold of my hand, love,
just keep squeezing,

15:30.461 --> 15:32.260
that's it, good stuff.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.136
June, it's not as bad as it seems,
I promise.

15:38.511 --> 15:40.566
Be careful with her, will you?

15:43.497 --> 15:45.828
Her BP's plummeting.

15:47.962 --> 15:50.279
She's lost a lot of blood.

15:52.488 --> 15:56.937
Breathing's shallow.
Think she'll need saline.

15:57.351 --> 15:59.024
Did you hear what I said?

15:59.131 --> 16:03.304
I'm not a doctor, chief.
I'm the ambulance driver.

17:21.117 --> 17:24.018
I want this mess
tidied up tonight.

17:26.487 --> 17:28.835
And I want this cleared away.

17:30.522 --> 17:33.561
I don't want any of her left
lying on the street.

17:34.834 --> 17:36.951
Get rid of all these people.

17:37.104 --> 17:38.961
Alright, move away!

17:41.032 --> 17:42.474
There's
nothing to see.

17:42.550 --> 17:45.911
I'll wait until... forensics...

17:48.473 --> 17:49.639
Here.

17:53.014 --> 17:55.331
Slipped right off her finger.

18:02.527 --> 18:04.736
She came to the
jewellers to get it...

18:07.974 --> 18:12.439
Clean it up!
I want <i>you</i> to clean it up!

18:12.608 --> 18:15.768
She works at the station.
She's one of us.

18:15.876 --> 18:18.146
I want to be able
to look her dad in the eye

18:18.238 --> 18:21.307
and say you cleaned up every drop
of her precious blood.

18:21.874 --> 18:23.440
Get off me!

18:23.946 --> 18:26.155
This entire place is cracked!

18:26.277 --> 18:28.917
You can't blame me,
you lunatic bastard!

18:29.024 --> 18:32.046
You were wrong!
I didn't do this! They did it!

18:32.122 --> 18:34.562
The diamonds they took were
only in the safe for one day.

18:34.639 --> 18:37.032
They had to hit it today.
I had Trent today,

18:37.108 --> 18:40.193
and <i>you</i> let him go
to prove a point!

18:40.316 --> 18:43.231
We had no evidence!

18:58.190 --> 19:00.967
I'm better than any of this!

19:01.534 --> 19:02.931
Says you.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.879
<i>He moved!</i>

19:19.002 --> 19:22.499
<i>Probably an involuntary muscle spasm
brought about by dehydration.</i>

19:23.417 --> 19:25.933
<i>...what course of action to take.</i>

19:26.102 --> 19:27.958
<i>These cases
are very complex.</i>

19:28.112 --> 19:29.908
<i>The body takes time to adapt.</i>

19:30.076 --> 19:32.331
<i>But not nearly as much time
as the mind.</i>

19:32.653 --> 19:35.400
<i>- Take his blood chemistry.
- Yes, doctor.</i>

19:35.569 --> 19:37.409
<i>He was given saline yesterday.</i>

19:37.501 --> 19:39.650
<i>It should have
taken effect by now.</i>

19:40.095 --> 19:43.378
<i>Miss Johnson. Barbara.</i>

19:43.885 --> 19:46.939
<i>Won't you at least consider
coming with me to Canterbury?</i>

19:47.184 --> 19:49.239
<i>You know
how I feel about you.</i>

20:14.446 --> 20:16.609
Why does it have
to be now, Nelson?

20:16.717 --> 20:19.080
Why this particular year?

20:19.203 --> 20:22.317
- What you saying, mon brave?
- '88 was a good vintage.

20:22.393 --> 20:24.695
Year I graduated
from the Force.

20:25.232 --> 20:28.070
Colour television.
Central heating.

20:28.163 --> 20:30.864
It was like bloody Star Trek
compared to this.

20:31.033 --> 20:32.612
Can I change it?

20:33.135 --> 20:36.142
I'll have 1988 please,
quick as you like!

20:36.311 --> 20:39.410
I don't mind staying,
if that's how it's gotta be,

20:39.517 --> 20:43.843
but please can I have a year
that's AD, as opposed to BC!

20:44.994 --> 20:46.283
<i>Game on.</i>

20:53.946 --> 20:56.401
These cuts are getting worse,
you know, man.

20:56.463 --> 20:59.454
Mr Heath had better
sort himself out.

21:00.513 --> 21:02.815
Gimme a Scotch.
Double, massive.

21:02.984 --> 21:04.702
Half a bottle.

21:04.948 --> 21:07.218
Sam, you can't stay here.

21:07.310 --> 21:09.259
Great. No worries.
Send me back.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.191
They're coming down here
to get bladdered.

21:11.283 --> 21:13.110
Gene finds you,
mood he's in, he'll...

21:13.202 --> 21:14.874
What's he gonna do,
put me in a coma?

21:14.966 --> 21:16.883
Perhaps it's best you went.

21:19.861 --> 21:22.837
You've got to make
the best of things, my friend.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.504
I've made the best of things.

21:26.241 --> 21:28.787
Give us a bottle
of house red, take away.

21:30.275 --> 21:33.282
- They're coming.
- Best go the back way.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.446
Sam!

21:41.599 --> 21:44.882
Nelson, deck of cards
and a bottle of blended.

21:45.005 --> 21:46.892
Coming up.

21:48.917 --> 21:50.589
Are you upset?

21:51.172 --> 21:54.638
I'm more than upset.
I'm comatose.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.247
I think you should go home.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.505
Love to.

21:58.827 --> 22:00.683
- Can't.
- Give over!

22:00.759 --> 22:04.089
If we're back to that again, then
prove to me that this is all rubbish.

22:04.197 --> 22:07.234
That I'm rubbish.
Nothing but a stupid fantasy.

22:07.311 --> 22:09.997
Go on, throw yourself
under a bus.

22:10.227 --> 22:11.392
Don't!

22:12.958 --> 22:15.305
Well, thought about it.

22:15.444 --> 22:18.619
What about
what just happened? June...

22:18.865 --> 22:20.322
That fake?

22:20.859 --> 22:22.500
She not real?

22:23.006 --> 22:25.093
Suppose right now,
that'd suit you...

22:25.170 --> 22:26.582
Shut up.

22:32.359 --> 22:34.644
Let me take you home, Sam.

22:35.074 --> 22:38.373
Back to your... fake flat.

22:50.112 --> 22:52.183
You know
what I was thinking?

22:52.352 --> 22:56.019
I was thinking about what I'd do
if I went back in time.

22:56.970 --> 22:58.474
Oh, great.

22:58.566 --> 23:00.484
You could put bets on things,
couldn't you?

23:00.576 --> 23:04.335
Annie, I was four.
I was still playing with Tonka toys.

23:04.412 --> 23:06.360
I know you're trying
to sort things out,

23:06.406 --> 23:09.152
but hiding in here, drinking wine,
isn't gonna do it.

23:09.283 --> 23:11.262
You have to go back to work.

23:11.492 --> 23:13.993
Give it a day or two,
talk to DCI Hunt.

23:14.100 --> 23:17.169
- I've got nothing to say to him.
- You went against him.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.746
I mean,
if he had his way,

23:19.838 --> 23:22.370
- from what I hear...
- What?

23:26.697 --> 23:30.118
I'm not blaming you.
You made a decision.

23:30.210 --> 23:34.475
And June's lying in an 'ospital bed
because I didn't listen to Gene Hunt,

23:34.551 --> 23:36.623
is that
what you're trying to say?

23:37.037 --> 23:41.010
I know people here
are tight with each other, but...

23:41.425 --> 23:43.036
they have to be.

23:43.818 --> 23:46.687
You have to believe
in the people around you.

23:48.774 --> 23:50.568
That would be nice.

23:55.294 --> 23:56.842
Goodnight.

24:11.397 --> 24:14.097
What are you smirking at,
Mona Lisa?

24:20.803 --> 24:23.304
I'm sorry you're lonely, Sam.

24:25.206 --> 24:27.661
Are you really lonely here?

24:29.639 --> 24:31.680
No no no, I'm not listening.

24:31.772 --> 24:34.028
Don't you think it can be
lonely out there too?

24:35.101 --> 24:37.372
In the white room
that's too warm?

24:37.464 --> 24:39.521
- Stop it.
- Life goes on.

24:39.628 --> 24:41.668
But does it really go on
for the sleeping man?

24:41.760 --> 24:44.215
- I'm not sleeping, I'm here!
- And isn't it better here,

24:44.262 --> 24:45.795
where you can be busy?

24:45.872 --> 24:48.742
Look, just.. just get out!

24:48.788 --> 24:52.347
Do you not like me with my clown?
I can see I make you frown...

24:52.424 --> 24:54.235
When on earth
will all this end?

24:54.342 --> 24:56.383
I'm your friend,
your only friend.

24:56.460 --> 24:58.147
Get out!

26:11.945 --> 26:14.077
It is a bit big, innit?

26:26.243 --> 26:29.296
If you've come
to interview her, guv, she...

26:30.692 --> 26:32.518
Oh, that feels better.

26:38.854 --> 26:41.386
What on earth is going on?

26:44.101 --> 26:45.927
Police officers.

26:52.508 --> 26:54.410
Oh, you are joking me.

27:02.697 --> 27:04.522
I love this city.

27:05.381 --> 27:08.603
Its mess. Its noise.

27:09.247 --> 27:12.699
Prozzies. Drunks.

27:13.037 --> 27:15.261
Stray dogs,
little old men.

27:16.627 --> 27:18.898
Buttered crumpets for tea.

27:19.466 --> 27:24.038
You're a right smart Alec and all,
not squeaky clean, nor's this place.

27:26.186 --> 27:29.454
Rest of this country couldn't give
a threepenny bit about this town.

27:30.053 --> 27:33.136
The orphans take whoever
they can get to look after them.

27:33.275 --> 27:34.763
That's me.

27:36.466 --> 27:38.813
So you want me out now.

27:40.516 --> 27:43.492
Are you joking?
You got to put this right.

27:44.643 --> 27:48.371
- I only know one way to police.
- So do I.

27:48.724 --> 27:51.225
She's not giving up
and nor should you.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.493
Come on, gentlemen.
On your way now.

27:55.199 --> 27:57.209
Right you are, Matron.

27:57.823 --> 28:00.799
- Come back when she's stronger.
- Yes...

28:03.623 --> 28:05.816
When her mum and dad
come to visit,

28:05.986 --> 28:09.438
tell them not to stop
talking to her, okay?

28:11.969 --> 28:13.442
Come on.

28:18.597 --> 28:20.531
I don't believe this.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.094
Right,

28:24.201 --> 28:27.899
let's pull in anyone who was in
Bitman Road around 1 o'clock yesterday!

28:27.967 --> 28:29.947
We have no ID
on the getaway car,

28:29.978 --> 28:34.059
but I want you checking out wasteground,
breaker's yards, landfill sites,

28:34.151 --> 28:37.572
looking for a vehicle that's very
recently been dumped.

28:38.047 --> 28:39.827
Come on then,
what are you waiting for?

28:40.517 --> 28:41.837
Shake this out!

28:43.019 --> 28:44.982
Thank you for your help sir.

28:45.043 --> 28:47.775
I won't be keeping you, I know you
wanna get back to your shop,

28:47.821 --> 28:51.073
- a lot of clearing up to do.
- I have rather. Thanks very much.

28:53.267 --> 28:56.872
Talked to everybody on the street, but
it's like Whitby fish market out there.

28:57.041 --> 28:59.680
- What?
- Lot of clams.

29:02.196 --> 29:03.669
Who's that?

29:04.713 --> 29:06.676
Tits in a jumper.

29:07.397 --> 29:08.916
May be a result.

29:10.710 --> 29:15.590
Guv, this lady has got an office
overlooking the shop.

29:16.832 --> 29:18.244
Hiya, love.

29:18.367 --> 29:23.721
Now, I don't want you
to be scared, but...

29:25.164 --> 29:27.250
get it off your chest.

29:27.634 --> 29:30.227
I told you, I saw nothing.

29:30.273 --> 29:31.915
I can't see
what good I'm doing here?

29:31.992 --> 29:35.321
Listen, love, I'm the policeman,
I'll decide if you're a help or not, ok?

29:35.413 --> 29:37.408
And we need witnesses.

29:37.546 --> 29:41.228
How else are we gonna get...
abreast of the case?

29:41.381 --> 29:44.434
Well, as they were running out,
the first one tripped.

29:44.526 --> 29:46.153
That's all I saw.

29:47.872 --> 29:50.004
Was he the one
holding the bag?

29:50.142 --> 29:53.364
- I think it was, yeah.
- Can you remember which hand?

29:53.932 --> 29:55.174
Right.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.952
Okay.
Thanks for your help.

29:58.167 --> 30:00.775
Come on, love,
we'll get you on a bus.

30:04.948 --> 30:08.200
Chris, any joy with forensics?

30:08.385 --> 30:10.717
Well, it's tied up at the lab.

30:11.131 --> 30:14.921
Sod it. Start threatening people
with obstruction.

30:15.059 --> 30:17.735
- Usually jogs a few memories.
- That's likely to make people

30:17.785 --> 30:20.459
even more scared of coming forward
if they do know something.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.316
Come on then, Brainiac.

30:22.423 --> 30:24.556
Surprise us with
your new way of policing.

30:24.679 --> 30:30.079
That woman just said the first one
to leave the shop slipped.

30:30.309 --> 30:32.319
Now, do you know
why that's important?

30:32.396 --> 30:34.973
- No.
- I do.

30:35.388 --> 30:37.322
Because the manager said

30:37.414 --> 30:41.004
the raider holding the bag
took off his left glove.

30:41.111 --> 30:43.213
So he could zip it up.

30:50.655 --> 30:51.867
What?

30:55.367 --> 30:56.609
Stop!

30:58.465 --> 31:01.134
Where do you feel like
putting your left hand?

31:01.871 --> 31:04.203
- Suppose this pipe.
- Don't touch it.

31:04.326 --> 31:06.305
Need to get it
dusted for prints.

31:06.351 --> 31:08.177
But forensics are tied up
at the moment.

31:08.254 --> 31:10.617
Can't get down there
for another 3 hours.

31:12.779 --> 31:14.927
Hey, you fancy a 99, boss?

31:16.355 --> 31:19.316
Just.. get the prints, Chris.

31:30.549 --> 31:33.096
If you can't take Mohammed
to the mountain...

31:33.357 --> 31:35.995
How many prints have you put
on that pipe between you?

31:36.609 --> 31:37.944
- Bugger.
- Yeah.

31:38.159 --> 31:39.049
Right.

31:39.310 --> 31:41.120
Hang on, where're you going?

31:41.810 --> 31:43.667
I'm gonna pull Trent in.

31:43.744 --> 31:46.291
His lawyer will throw
the book at you, guv.

31:46.425 --> 31:48.497
I'll plant a blood-stained
dagger on him.

31:48.543 --> 31:51.212
I'm gonna nick him for every
outstanding crime in the division,

31:51.258 --> 31:54.004
including the Maple Lane
Poisonings of 1883.

31:54.366 --> 31:56.274
Alright,
beat a confession out him.

31:56.345 --> 31:58.341
It won't be worth
the bus fare to court.

31:58.388 --> 32:00.745
I've never fitted anyone up
who hadn't deserve it.

32:08.064 --> 32:08.952
Sorry.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.239
Hang on, police.
Hold it there.

32:15.269 --> 32:18.274
Oi, he said
stop right there, deaf-aid!

32:21.553 --> 32:23.104
What's happened to your cart?

32:24.448 --> 32:25.961
Cart? Nothing.

32:28.367 --> 32:30.841
You were here yesterday
at the time of the robbery.

32:32.982 --> 32:34.239
What's your name?

32:35.397 --> 32:38.334
- What - is - your -
- Leonard Pit!

32:40.298 --> 32:42.566
Did someone run
into your cart, Leonard?

32:43.725 --> 32:45.050
Is this car paint?

32:48.526 --> 32:49.881
That's recent.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.460
What's that noise?!

32:57.706 --> 32:59.140
Ruining my cuppa!

32:59.288 --> 33:01.144
Oh, don't fret,
Phyllis, it's him.

33:01.222 --> 33:02.145
Lieutenant Uhura.

33:02.204 --> 33:05.110
Well, rip it out of his ear
before it ruins our radios.

33:06.230 --> 33:09.214
Annie, could you get Mr Pit
a cup of tea?

33:11.316 --> 33:13.143
He's a key witness.

33:13.496 --> 33:16.088
So could you treat him
like a person, Phyllis?

33:16.274 --> 33:17.531
Do you remember people?

33:17.738 --> 33:20.575
- You used to be one.
- Not bad for you, boss.

33:24.543 --> 33:27.066
- There you go.
- Thanks.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.375
Okay,
you were in Bitman Road,

33:30.434 --> 33:32.143
at around one o'clock.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.411
- A car draws up...
- Just relax, lad.

33:34.460 --> 33:37.150
No one's gonna come in
and blow your brains out.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.350
Leonard. Please, okay?

33:39.409 --> 33:41.137
A black car, yeah?

33:42.512 --> 33:45.625
Ford. Granada.

33:46.460 --> 33:47.676
Registration?

33:48.217 --> 33:49.307
E...

33:52.007 --> 33:52.802
Don't know.

33:53.086 --> 33:54.471
Sorry, was that like,

33:54.540 --> 33:57.859
you saying the letter E,
and you don't know the rest,

33:57.947 --> 34:01.247
or was that like you saying
"Ee, I dunno"?

34:03.583 --> 34:05.989
Did you see
the men in the car?

34:06.058 --> 34:06.862
No.

34:08.443 --> 34:10.976
Wow, you are dead impressive,
Leonard, you know that?

34:11.034 --> 34:12.301
No, you are, you're...

34:13.784 --> 34:16.426
...not wor... give it a....

34:17.938 --> 34:20.324
Take your time, Leonard,
take your time.

34:20.687 --> 34:22.828
Now, there aren't any
skid marks on the road,

34:22.947 --> 34:25.331
so if these guys
were going fast enough

34:25.411 --> 34:27.599
- to lose control...
- Look, I've heard enough.

34:28.012 --> 34:31.389
Okay, listen.
A girl was shot, she's critical.

34:35.061 --> 34:36.170
They hit you.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.987
They hit your cart
deliberately, didn't they?

34:43.309 --> 34:46.078
Was it a threat? A warning?

34:48.670 --> 34:49.917
Talk to me.

34:53.029 --> 34:54.679
He didn't have his mask on.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.468
He was
talking to the other two.

34:58.556 --> 35:00.305
I saw his
face.

35:12.048 --> 35:15.160
Now, I know some of you
don't like the way I do things,

35:15.905 --> 35:18.714
and I know some of you
blame me for yesterday.

35:19.883 --> 35:21.856
But if we all pull together,

35:23.782 --> 35:27.149
we can put Trent and
his gang away forever.

35:28.151 --> 35:32.295
We have a witness who can ID Trent,
and place him in the car.

35:33.777 --> 35:35.113
So let's pull him in.

35:38.539 --> 35:41.240
Piece of scum bastard scum!

35:41.328 --> 35:44.283
Dare you!
Dare you treat me like this!

35:44.342 --> 35:48.101
You filthy,
stinking, pig-sucking,

35:48.200 --> 35:50.655
rotten, bleeding filth!

35:50.778 --> 35:54.153
You're filth!
Rotten, bloody filth!

35:54.276 --> 35:57.069
Your mum's filth,
and your kids are filth!

35:57.161 --> 35:59.983
Mrs Trent, why don't you just tell us
where we can find your nephew?

36:00.045 --> 36:02.423
- Piss off!
- Look, if you help me,

36:02.531 --> 36:05.245
then I can call him off.
Oh dear.

36:05.798 --> 36:09.281
You filthy pervert nonse pig!

36:09.757 --> 36:12.334
Why don't you just give us
a name, love, eh?

36:12.457 --> 36:14.359
Pub called the Coachman!

36:15.311 --> 36:17.797
- Coachman.
- <i>Smashing.</i>

36:19.192 --> 36:20.650
Thanks for your help, love.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.135
You're a set of bastards, both of you,
do you know th...

36:23.227 --> 36:24.562
Shut up.

36:27.293 --> 36:30.638
White dog shit.
Takes me back.

36:30.715 --> 36:34.872
I've got 20 people who swear I was
in that boozer all day yesterday.

36:35.087 --> 36:37.374
We'll see, laughing boy.

36:37.512 --> 36:39.383
Don't break his arm, Ray.

36:39.745 --> 36:42.176
Well, don't lose your bottle
again, boss, eh?

36:42.238 --> 36:45.045
Or we'll all be in the
shit.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.790
Ray doesn't like me, does he?

36:51.158 --> 36:53.859
It's just,
he was going for Inspector,

36:53.920 --> 36:56.067
and then when you turned up,
it sorta...

36:56.882 --> 36:59.414
No, he hates your guts, boss.

37:00.103 --> 37:03.725
What about you, Chris? Do you think
I'm going about things the right way?

37:04.753 --> 37:06.870
Dunno, I suppose.

37:07.622 --> 37:09.632
Right, he's ready.

37:09.786 --> 37:12.808
Okay, Leonard. This bloke
won't be able you touch you.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.818
You'll be standing
behind special glass,

37:14.895 --> 37:16.950
so he won't even
be able to see you.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.901
Take your time.

37:38.539 --> 37:40.488
Don't you move.

37:42.753 --> 37:43.964
None.

37:45.775 --> 37:46.941
What?

37:47.693 --> 37:50.424
- It's none of 'em.
- Leonard!

38:00.359 --> 38:02.461
Special glass?

38:04.770 --> 38:07.240
If you give me
a bit of time with him,

38:07.332 --> 38:10.232
- I think I can gain his trust.
- Gain his trust?

38:10.340 --> 38:11.827
What does he think he is?

38:11.904 --> 38:14.191
No, I'm gonna throw the book
at the little gobshite.

38:14.268 --> 38:17.904
See how he likes being banged up
for obstructing the course of justice.

38:18.057 --> 38:21.142
What's the point in terrifying him?
He needs to feel secure.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.579
- It's okay, Leonard.
- Never trust a copper!

38:24.931 --> 38:26.006
What you on about?

38:26.113 --> 38:29.074
"I'm gonna throw the book
at the little gobshite"!?

38:29.227 --> 38:30.884
You can lipread.

38:31.514 --> 38:34.858
- Sorry you had to hear that.
- He didn't. He saw it.

38:36.361 --> 38:37.880
Nice one, guv.

38:37.987 --> 38:40.258
So he wants to feel
all nice and safe, well, tough!

38:40.350 --> 38:42.513
He's witness to a robbery.

38:43.341 --> 38:46.931
- What if we offer him immunity?
- From what, measles, mumps, what?

38:46.961 --> 38:47.836
Witness protection.

38:47.913 --> 38:50.935
Right now, the only person
he needs protecting from is me.

38:53.021 --> 38:55.077
I need to know what you saw.

38:55.170 --> 38:57.317
Now, you're gonna have
to trust me, okay?

38:57.517 --> 38:59.420
I'm not
like the rest of them.

38:59.926 --> 39:02.058
I wanna go home.

39:04.329 --> 39:06.385
Let me show you something.

39:06.829 --> 39:08.625
Take a good look.

39:08.779 --> 39:12.185
This is what he did to her.
She's still critical.

39:12.844 --> 39:16.956
Now, if you can formally identify
Kim Trent as the man in that car,

39:17.125 --> 39:19.288
we can arrest him,
and his accomplices,

39:19.395 --> 39:22.357
and then that's it.
They'll be inside.

39:23.094 --> 39:26.653
I can guarantee you
total protection.

39:29.629 --> 39:31.332
Now, will you help me?

39:40.307 --> 39:41.704
Good man.

39:42.057 --> 39:44.205
Now, I need you to
take a ride with me

39:44.282 --> 39:47.365
and see if we can find Trent
and identify him.

39:47.442 --> 39:49.728
- No!
- Relax, relax.

39:49.896 --> 39:52.489
I'm talking about
travelling incognito.

40:01.384 --> 40:03.270
I just point?

40:03.592 --> 40:05.618
You don't even have to point.

40:05.710 --> 40:08.518
If you see Trent,
just tap the side of the van.

40:08.641 --> 40:10.636
That's a formal identification.

40:10.897 --> 40:14.380
- Can I have an ice cream?
- And me!

40:24.310 --> 40:25.292
Annie!

40:28.207 --> 40:31.997
Leonard is our star witness
in the Bitman Road robbery.

40:32.165 --> 40:33.992
He needs looking
after tonight.

40:34.068 --> 40:36.461
Oh, aye?
Don't like the sound of that.

40:36.523 --> 40:38.686
Just look after him til morning.

40:38.825 --> 40:42.338
I'll stick a CID car outside as well.
It'll only be a few hours.

40:42.476 --> 40:45.269
Then, first light,
bring him into the station.

40:48.827 --> 40:50.438
Double bubble?

40:51.267 --> 40:52.985
Double time, yeah.

40:54.335 --> 40:55.501
Why me?

40:55.547 --> 40:58.047
I need somebody
in the house I can trust.

40:59.643 --> 41:01.270
Annie's gonna sit
with him tonight.

41:01.316 --> 41:04.875
Eh, Leonard!
Fanny in the flat. Nice work.

41:08.802 --> 41:10.260
Thanks, Annie.

41:11.611 --> 41:14.924
He may be a laughing stock to you,
but he's all we've got.

41:15.047 --> 41:16.390
Now, we'll try again
tomorrow.

41:16.452 --> 41:19.366
You're betting on a handicapped
who'll bolt before he gets to court.

41:19.428 --> 41:21.461
I told him
we'd stick a car outside.

41:21.553 --> 41:24.805
You're taking the mick.
I mean, Witness Protection?

41:24.851 --> 41:27.859
That's only used by blokes
who testify against the Mafia.

41:27.952 --> 41:30.069
He needs to know that
we're true to our word.

41:30.146 --> 41:31.403
What about Chris and Ray?

41:31.465 --> 41:35.117
Load of cars we've got,
at least stick 'em outside. Guv?

41:36.129 --> 41:38.093
Wish I were bloody deaf!

41:42.082 --> 41:45.335
Alright then.
But they won't like it.

41:48.251 --> 41:51.043
Delta Four.
Are you there, Ray?

41:51.197 --> 41:54.571
<i>Yeah. Parked up
outside his flat now, boss.</i>

41:55.415 --> 41:58.315
- Happy?
- <i>Cock-a-hoop.</i>

41:59.850 --> 42:02.980
Just make sure
you're visible at all times.

42:09.180 --> 42:11.574
- You off?
- Pub.

42:13.155 --> 42:15.026
'Course. Silly me.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.972
Big darts match tonight
against C Division.

42:18.553 --> 42:20.470
Chris and Ray
are outside Leonard's.

42:20.531 --> 42:21.697
Right, fine.

42:21.759 --> 42:23.754
Annie Cartwright's
inside the flat with him.

42:24.030 --> 42:26.131
Isn't he a well-protected bunny.

42:26.469 --> 42:28.724
- It's worth it.
- Nah, 'course it is.

42:29.813 --> 42:31.884
So, big match?

42:32.498 --> 42:35.798
- It's not your bag.
- Probably not.

42:35.936 --> 42:36.917
Fine.

42:37.669 --> 42:39.403
Super-duper.

42:44.236 --> 42:47.474
<i>920 to Alpha One.</i>

42:47.826 --> 42:51.923
<i>It's probably nothing, but there was
a noise round the back of the flat.</i>

42:52.000 --> 42:55.697
<i>Can't see anything, but
stuff's been kicked over out here.</i>

42:56.026 --> 42:58.067
Tell her to go round the front.

42:58.205 --> 43:00.414
920, check the street, over.

43:00.583 --> 43:03.023
<i>Going round there now.</i>

43:03.299 --> 43:04.771
Call Ray and Chris.

43:04.909 --> 43:07.334
Alpha One to 867, come in.

43:07.518 --> 43:08.914
Nothing.

43:09.098 --> 43:12.719
<i>Alpha One, I'm in the street
and there's nothing out here.</i>

43:13.471 --> 43:14.729
Annie?

43:14.883 --> 43:16.923
<i>You again, eh?</i>

43:17.153 --> 43:19.163
<i>Checking up on us, sir?</i>

43:19.593 --> 43:22.124
Where's DS Carling parked?

43:22.277 --> 43:25.561
<i>Ray? I don't know.</i>

43:27.432 --> 43:30.670
They're in a car right outside.
They should be right near you now.

43:30.793 --> 43:33.278
<i>No cars out here at all.</i>

43:34.091 --> 43:35.579
Are you sure?

43:35.610 --> 43:38.609
<i>Hasn't been a car out here
for the last hour.</i>

43:38.808 --> 43:39.867
Bastard!

43:39.929 --> 43:42.744
If you give him babysitting jobs,
don't expect him to hang around.

43:42.820 --> 43:44.877
This is bloody Hunt!

43:45.138 --> 43:48.497
<i>I'm going back inside.
Leonard's a bit rattled.</i>

43:49.219 --> 43:50.430
<i>Leonard?</i>

43:51.612 --> 43:53.913
- Annie!
- 920, Annie, love?

43:54.081 --> 43:58.485
<i>Urgent assistance required!
Back-up... I need back-up!</i>

43:58.562 --> 44:00.433
<i>Leonard, wait!</i>

44:00.602 --> 44:02.812
Alpha One to 920.
Annie, what's happened, love?

44:02.843 --> 44:04.929
I need all units. Do it!

44:05.036 --> 44:08.167
This is a call to all units.
Officer in urgent need of assistance.

44:08.290 --> 44:10.667
56 Diduick Road
on the Charter Estate.

44:10.728 --> 44:12.647
All units respond immediately!

44:12.708 --> 44:14.994
I need officers mobilised to key
positions.

44:15.040 --> 44:15.915
Boss?

44:16.160 --> 44:19.444
Don't know where the key positions are.
I can't read this, it's all changed!

44:19.506 --> 44:22.282
You need the guv. He knows these
streets like the back of his hand.

44:23.386 --> 44:25.704
You were supposed
to be protecting Leonard.

44:25.811 --> 44:28.219
Oops. Fair cop.

44:29.002 --> 44:31.625
They've got him.
And Annie's there.

44:31.763 --> 44:33.312
On her own.

44:36.167 --> 44:38.115
I've sent Ray and Chris
straight there.

44:38.192 --> 44:39.220
Where are you now, love?

44:39.296 --> 44:42.059
Phyllis, you're not on the phone
to your sister in Blackburn.

44:42.105 --> 44:45.707
920, state your location.
I can't raise her, sir.

44:45.722 --> 44:47.620
We're gonna lose her
in that estate. It's too big.

44:47.667 --> 44:49.976
She's gonna go east. That's the
quickest way out of the estate.

44:50.023 --> 44:52.621
We can get bobbies to cover
the junctions leading out.

44:52.708 --> 44:53.713
Keep trying.

44:54.043 --> 44:56.164
Annie, give us
your position. Over.

44:56.297 --> 44:59.259
And tell all units they were last seen
driving a black Ford Granada.

44:59.282 --> 45:01.811
- Three IC1 males.
- Three what?

45:01.866 --> 45:04.318
- That code?
- No, three white blokes.

45:04.372 --> 45:06.092
Almost certainly armed.

45:06.256 --> 45:07.694
All units to the Charter Estate.

45:07.725 --> 45:09.372
Be on the lookout
for 3 white men,

45:09.436 --> 45:11.818
possibly in a black
Ford Granada, armed.

45:11.873 --> 45:14.434
God, she shouldn't be
out there alone, slip of a girl!

45:14.494 --> 45:15.844
No, she shouldn't.

45:15.946 --> 45:17.658
Phyllis, get all units
into that estate.

45:17.697 --> 45:20.329
No. Response directives have to be
clear and precise.

45:20.353 --> 45:23.062
- This is an emergency.
- Especially in an emergency!

45:23.154 --> 45:25.749
The units know what they're doing,
they're covering the exits.

45:25.797 --> 45:28.121
If you send them
into that maze, willy-nilly,

45:28.168 --> 45:29.779
you will lose all cohesion.

45:29.818 --> 45:31.955
Look, if she goes east,
where does that put her?

45:32.191 --> 45:33.249
Anywhere out here.

45:33.274 --> 45:36.158
I'll try and get hold of her and
Leonard. Get uniform to hold back.

45:36.211 --> 45:38.058
And
keep those exit junctions covered!

45:38.107 --> 45:39.471
Your number's 870.

45:39.520 --> 45:42.899
Wait for my signal before you move the
other units in or you will lose Trent.

45:42.937 --> 45:45.568
Yeah, alright, but
take one of the unmarked cars.

45:50.153 --> 45:53.453
870 to Alpha One, I'm outside
the old waterworks now.

45:53.522 --> 45:56.094
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- I think they're inside.

45:56.202 --> 45:58.343
- <i>Any sign of Annie or Leonard?</i>
- No.

45:58.913 --> 46:00.661
<i>Her radio's still dead.</i>

46:01.033 --> 46:02.585
Are you holding the units back?

46:02.664 --> 46:04.166
<i>I said I would.</i>

46:04.902 --> 46:07.288
Okay, the last thing we need
is Trent feeling cornered,

46:07.317 --> 46:09.241
especially if he's got
Annie and Leonard.

46:09.379 --> 46:10.282
I'm going in.

46:28.192 --> 46:28.918
Shit!

46:29.751 --> 46:32.222
Are you alright?
Are you hurt?

46:32.299 --> 46:33.847
Didn't know what'd
happened to you.

46:33.926 --> 46:36.096
The battery's out of my radio.

46:38.413 --> 46:41.064
- Where's Leonard?
- I lost him.

46:41.202 --> 46:42.439
They might have got him.

46:42.518 --> 46:45.002
They've got all sorts of weapons
and they mean business.

46:45.208 --> 46:48.292
Leonard's smart. If they haven't
found him, he'll be hiding.

46:48.390 --> 46:50.187
We need to get to him first.

46:52.189 --> 46:53.879
What if they have got to him?

46:58.247 --> 46:59.131
Wait!

47:09.276 --> 47:12.242
Leonard! Oh, god,
you had us worried!

47:12.291 --> 47:14.127
Turn your hearing aid down.

47:17.525 --> 47:18.683
- You alright?
- Okay.

47:22.317 --> 47:23.093
Go!

47:24.595 --> 47:25.734
Down there!

47:26.520 --> 47:27.355
Sam!

47:32.274 --> 47:33.718
Round them up, Brix.

47:41.788 --> 47:44.164
We're in the waterworks.
Send all units.

47:45.441 --> 47:46.196
Guv!

48:39.021 --> 48:40.121
Brixter?!

48:50.338 --> 48:51.967
There's a way out!

48:55.990 --> 48:57.051
Come on!

49:01.759 --> 49:02.897
Drop the gun.

49:03.594 --> 49:04.547
Or what?

49:05.163 --> 49:07.088
You're gonna arrest us?

49:07.511 --> 49:10.005
You, the bird
and the spastic?

49:11.861 --> 49:12.706
Yeah.

49:13.197 --> 49:16.112
For armed robbery
and attempted murder.

49:18.479 --> 49:20.167
Place is surrounded.

49:20.766 --> 49:22.151
By who?

49:22.524 --> 49:24.371
They've left you on your own.

49:25.057 --> 49:29.604
And from what I've seen,
your DCI'll be glad to get shot of you.

49:30.851 --> 49:33.571
Bet you wish
you'd left us in that cell now.

49:33.719 --> 49:34.504
No.

49:34.661 --> 49:37.194
Leonard, stay behind me.

49:37.312 --> 49:38.579
We'll protect you.

49:39.266 --> 49:41.034
Face down!

49:41.328 --> 49:43.331
You know what, Mr Tyler?

49:45.158 --> 49:47.592
I'm gonna be
leaving you til last.

49:48.879 --> 49:52.188
That way, you get
to see what happens.

49:55.614 --> 49:58.344
- You're nicked, Trent.
- Drop it!

50:03.038 --> 50:04.224
Get off us!

50:04.303 --> 50:06.336
Come on, let me go!

50:47.847 --> 50:51.253
You don't have to say anything,
just point.

51:10.582 --> 51:12.561
Bloody power cuts.

51:23.578 --> 51:25.619
You didn't have to do that.

51:25.926 --> 51:28.196
You said you'd protect us.

51:30.436 --> 51:31.909
And you did.

51:33.013 --> 51:34.701
You all did.

51:50.749 --> 51:52.176
Which one are you?

51:53.588 --> 51:55.076
All three.

51:56.994 --> 51:59.525
Look, I was thinking, guv.

51:59.940 --> 52:03.070
I know having me here
is difficult for you.

52:04.053 --> 52:06.108
What if I went back?

52:06.568 --> 52:08.133
To Hyde?

52:10.052 --> 52:11.724
Is that possible?

52:13.043 --> 52:14.946
I'll get on the blower.

52:18.781 --> 52:20.960
You can do that?

52:21.603 --> 52:24.151
Send me back
to where I came from?

52:31.577 --> 52:34.046
Hello, is that
the Wizard of Oz?

52:34.752 --> 52:36.686
The Wizard'll sort it out.

52:36.747 --> 52:39.462
It's because of the
wonderful things he does.

52:47.518 --> 52:50.893
You were transferred here, Sam,
at your own request.

52:51.230 --> 52:53.056
I didn't ask for you.

52:54.300 --> 52:56.248
You wanted to come.

53:08.430 --> 53:11.974
And the doctors say
you're off the critical list now.

53:12.112 --> 53:16.025
You'll be out in plenty of time
to enjoy that wedding of yours.

53:23.987 --> 53:25.844
Is that urine?

53:28.006 --> 53:29.587
I'll get someone.

53:46.208 --> 53:48.449
Damnit. Hello?

53:49.461 --> 53:52.545
I can't open the door,
can somebody help me?

53:53.911 --> 53:56.334
- <i>What've you done?</i>
- <i>Nothing.</i>

53:56.426 --> 53:58.114
<i>Then why's his life
support's shut down?</i>

53:58.160 --> 53:59.940
<i>It's not my fault.</i>

54:00.385 --> 54:03.054
My god. Who's that?

54:03.115 --> 54:06.399
<i>Look. Here's his catheter.
It's leaked down the bed.</i>

54:06.951 --> 54:09.252
<i>It's gone into the electrics.</i>

54:09.314 --> 54:13.380
Help me! Somebody open the door!
I need to get out!

54:13.609 --> 54:15.927
<i>He's in distress,
get the doctor!</i>

54:16.801 --> 54:19.301
<i>This is what happens when he's left
on his own too long.</i>

54:19.409 --> 54:21.619
Please, somebody help me!

54:21.695 --> 54:23.091
Open the door.

54:23.152 --> 54:25.853
- <i>Hold on, Sam.</i>
- What? What?

54:25.930 --> 54:27.832
<i>Let's get this back in for you.</i>

54:27.955 --> 54:31.115
I need to get out,
help me! Help!

54:31.192 --> 54:32.650
Gene!

54:36.454 --> 54:38.127
<i>I'm switching it back on.</i>

54:38.541 --> 54:39.875
<i>There!</i>

54:58.387 --> 55:00.658
Hey, pilgrim.

55:02.294 --> 55:05.793
Give me a Scotch. Don't fancy
going out there tonight.

55:05.900 --> 55:07.817
Stay in here a while, man.

55:08.002 --> 55:10.150
Shake yourself down.

55:13.401 --> 55:14.890
Be cool.

55:15.059 --> 55:18.741
You deserve it.
You've been busy.

55:21.871 --> 55:23.697
You in, Tyler?

55:24.586 --> 55:27.118
50p gets you a chair.

55:39.653 --> 55:41.985
I'm gonna take a leak.

55:51.896 --> 55:53.937
Sure you're in?

55:58.095 --> 55:59.614
Deal me.
