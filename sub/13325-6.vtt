WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:03.569
I've got to admit, dad,
you really surprise me.

00:03.571 --> 00:06.238
Giving sam your old car
is really generous.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.073
You're getting soft
in your old age.

00:08.075 --> 00:10.476
Hey, she's my grandbaby.
I want her driving around
in something safe.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.777
So what are you gonna use
to get around?

00:11.779 --> 00:13.479
I'm gonna keep
driving my car.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.215
Excuse me?

00:16.217 --> 00:19.551
I figure you're only gonna
take sam out for a driving
lesson once a week.

00:19.553 --> 00:23.756
And you can call
and schedule the time
to use it whenever you want.

00:23.758 --> 00:27.259
Schedule a time?
Hold on.

00:27.261 --> 00:30.129
Who's gonna pay for
the maintenance and the tags
and everything else?

00:30.131 --> 00:31.797
Well, I'm old-fashioned,
and, you know,

00:31.799 --> 00:34.733
I'd make sam get a job
so she could pay for it,

00:34.735 --> 00:36.702
But it'll probably
end up being you.

00:38.438 --> 00:40.439
You're like
an evil tom sawyer.

00:40.441 --> 00:43.142
I'm not gonna paint
your fence

00:43.144 --> 00:45.110
And I'm not
gonna buy your car.
Here, take your pink slip back.

00:45.112 --> 00:47.446
It's too late.
I already told sam
and she's thrilled.

00:47.448 --> 00:50.049
But if you want to break
her heart, it's your car.

00:51.284 --> 00:52.785
You can't take advantage
of me, old man.

00:52.787 --> 00:56.088
I know where you live
because I pay your rent.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.157
This is why
you don't get cable.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.530
Sorry. Sorry.

01:04.532 --> 01:07.666
I'm sure you all heard that.
Little problem with my dad.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.468
I accidentally confused him

01:09.470 --> 01:12.271
With a caring
and loving grandfather.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.206
How'd that make you feel?

01:14.208 --> 01:16.742
Well, thanks, ed.
I appreciate your concern.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.277
It was a little upsetting.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.778
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.247
Why don't we talk about it
for six months?

01:23.349 --> 01:25.451
Did you use your tools?

01:25.453 --> 01:28.253
Well, you're clearly having
a worse day than usual.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.789
Why, because
I'm not my usual

01:30.791 --> 01:33.826
Ray of goddamn sunshine?

01:33.828 --> 01:38.797
Talk about the positive
things we can take from
negative experiences.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.567
For example, I just found
another reason

01:41.569 --> 01:44.203
Not to be sad
when my dad dies.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.172
- Who wants to go next?
- I will.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.875
I had a negative experience
that taught me

01:49.877 --> 01:53.312
That a good friend is the most
important thing in the world.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.214
Well, that's great.
How did you learn that?

01:55.216 --> 01:57.616
'cause I was at this club
and this girl gave me
a dirty look.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.120
So I threw my drink
in her face, but the stir
stick hit her in the eye

02:01.122 --> 02:04.857
And her friend was nice enough
to take her to the hospital.

02:04.859 --> 02:07.226
That meant a lot to me.

02:07.228 --> 02:10.596
I've got another
positive spin on that story.

02:10.598 --> 02:15.434
Well, an innocent girl
got tired of using
her eyeball,

02:15.436 --> 02:18.904
So lacey tries
to poke it out for her.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.607
Of course,
I'm not a professional.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.376
I can tell you
what else you're not--
a subtle drunk.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.845
I can smell the old grand-dad
from here, old granddad.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.515
Ed, what's in the can?

02:29.517 --> 02:31.316
Narc.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.218
Ed, you can't drink
in group.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.888
I can fix that.
I'll go home.

02:35.890 --> 02:39.892
Hey, look,
I made a positive
out of a negative.

02:39.894 --> 02:41.927
Ed, ed, ed,
please sit down.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.695
No, no,
it won't do any good.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.798
I'm not getting any better.
What's 20 minutes gonna do?

02:46.800 --> 02:49.568
I'll just call my wife
and tell her to burn
my dinner early.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.537
She's the only reason
I'm here anyway.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.173
Wow. Your wife
makes you come here?

02:54.175 --> 02:56.308
No, it's purely
coincidental

02:56.310 --> 03:00.179
That if I don't come,
my wife said she'd leave me.

03:00.181 --> 03:03.715
Ed, ed, these are
all things you should
talk about in group.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.250
Why don't you
stick around?

03:05.252 --> 03:06.785
Nope, I'm leaving.
You can't stop me.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.188
Yeah, let's just leave that
to the telephone pole

03:09.190 --> 03:11.190
At the end of the block.

03:11.192 --> 03:14.226
Okay, because of that,
you're taking ed home.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.728
Hey, it's all right
with me.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.798
'cause I actually care
about my fellow human beings.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.634
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That was way too easy.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.236
Where were you planning
on taking him?

03:24.238 --> 03:26.738
Transvestite bar
in koreatown.

03:28.675 --> 03:31.243
- Lacey, would you
take ed home?
- I'd be glad to.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.345
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lacey.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.915
Black comedy club,
south central.

03:36.917 --> 03:40.285
- Nolan?
- Yeah?

03:40.287 --> 03:42.454
I trust you.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.822
Would you please
take ed home?

03:43.824 --> 03:45.824
Okay.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.759
I only have a twin bed,

03:47.761 --> 03:49.494
But we can sleep
head to toe.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.566
Charlie:
<i>Ah, that was great.</i>

03:54.568 --> 03:56.668
I told you you'd like it.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.604
High five.

04:01.274 --> 04:04.843
Listen, I'm having a problem
with one of my patients.

04:04.845 --> 04:07.913
Seriously?
Untie me.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.448
Well, I would, but then
you wouldn't listen to me

04:09.450 --> 04:12.251
Talk about
one of my patients.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.653
Ed has been
very disruptive in group.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.822
- Pickles.
- What?

04:16.824 --> 04:18.991
- I thought that
was our safe word.
- No, we changed it.

04:18.993 --> 04:21.326
Anyway, he's a tough old guy.

04:21.328 --> 04:23.262
I've had clients that age.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.730
Sometimes they're just
too set in their ways.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.932
If he's a problem,
cut him loose.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.735
While you're at it,
cut me loose, too.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.837
No. No.
No man left behind.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.839
I've got to find
a way to help him.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.007
Spackle.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.309
Close.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.279
But it doesn't matter.
I thought maybe we could
go again.

04:40.281 --> 04:43.382
Yeah, I used that chinese
herb stuff you gave me

04:43.384 --> 04:45.817
For my birthday
and it works.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.954
No wonder they got
two billion people.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.291
You're kidding me.
I forgot to get you a gift,

04:52.293 --> 04:54.526
So I just dumped some spices
and tea in a jar.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.529
- That was a joke.
- So it was all me?

04:57.531 --> 05:00.432
Well, I'd like to think
I was in there somewhere.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.734
Maybe this could
work for ed?

05:02.736 --> 05:05.737
Are you two having
trouble in the bedroom?

05:05.739 --> 05:07.739
No, no, no.
But if I can convince ed

05:07.741 --> 05:10.075
To take some kind
of magic bullet that'll
suppress his anger,

05:10.077 --> 05:12.477
He'll believe it
and feel less angry.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.046
Nope, bad idea.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.982
Placebos are fine
for drug research,
but not for therapy.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.418
And are you okay
with lying to a patient?

05:19.420 --> 05:20.952
Well, I'll have
to tell him eventually,

05:20.954 --> 05:23.088
But hopefully by then
he'll have enough
positive results

05:23.090 --> 05:25.324
And realize that it was
in him all along.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.692
But you tell me
if you think I'm wrong.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.094
You're wrong.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.363
See?
Even you're not sure.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.933
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

05:37.503 --> 05:40.038
Holy crap.
How many pages
do I have to fill out

05:40.040 --> 05:42.441
Just so you can
go on a field trip
to feed the homeless?

05:42.443 --> 05:44.609
Well, I need your permission
to go into that neighborhood.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.445
There's a homeless
neighborhood?

05:46.447 --> 05:49.414
Here's an idea.
Let's build some houses there.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.650
Okay, fine.
Let's do this.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.553
"does your child have lice?"

05:54.555 --> 05:56.488
No.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.790
"any emotional issues
or disorders that might
create a difficulty

05:58.792 --> 06:00.792
For your child to participate
in this activity?"

06:01.861 --> 06:04.529
Do we finally tell them
I have ocd or not?

06:04.531 --> 06:06.431
I thought we were going
to save that little gem
for college

06:06.433 --> 06:08.066
When we start begging
for financial aid.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.470
You write down ocd,
sweetheart,

06:11.472 --> 06:13.872
And it could ruin your chances
of getting a job someday.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.540
Or it could help me land

06:15.542 --> 06:18.910
That touch-everything-twice job
I've always dreamt about.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.712
Thanks for the parenting
advice, dad,

06:20.714 --> 06:23.682
But we want sam
to think of you as more
of a cautionary tale.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.754
All right, we will leave
this decision for the next
field trip.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.589
- There you go, sweetie.
- Thank you.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.692
You ask me, all this
paperwork's a lot of nonsense.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.495
When I was a kid,
we learned how to milk
rattlesnakes in school

06:36.497 --> 06:39.131
And nobody
had to sign crap.

06:39.133 --> 06:42.501
Are you ever going to
stop being a pain in the ass
or have you just given up?

06:46.005 --> 06:49.508
Hey, charlie,
before I leave, can I ask
you something about kate?

06:49.510 --> 06:51.143
Does she hate me?

06:51.145 --> 06:53.612
No. No, she likes you.
Why?

06:53.614 --> 06:56.581
Well, I texted her
a couple of times about
us going out together

06:56.583 --> 06:58.650
And she never
got back to me.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.986
- I know she's really busy.
- Well, it kind of bums me out.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.788
I mean, I barely have
any women friends

07:02.790 --> 07:05.657
And I just thought, you know,
you guys are so close,

07:05.659 --> 07:07.592
She must be pretty fun
to hang out with.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.829
I wouldn't say fun.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.799
I mean, we're friends,
but I bring, like,

07:13.801 --> 07:16.501
80% of the fun.

07:16.503 --> 07:19.004
She may be 10.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.572
There's another 10%
that's, like,

07:20.574 --> 07:22.607
I don't know,
accidental fun.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.143
Well, then, maybe think
about the three of us

07:25.145 --> 07:27.846
Doing something
together sometime.
That could be fun.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.614
Oh, I have
thought about it.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.917
( chuckles )
you're right,
it could be fun.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.720
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming in early.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.222
Something I want
to talk to you about.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.557
Hey, where's ed?

07:38.559 --> 07:40.158
That's what this is about.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.060
I asked him to come
at the normal time.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.697
Now, I know we all think
ed can be a pain at times,

07:45.699 --> 07:47.699
But deep down I think
we all care about him

07:47.701 --> 07:49.000
And don't want to see
him suffer, right?

07:49.002 --> 07:51.570
Oh, my god.
We're gonna have
him put down.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.673
No, we're not gonna
have ed destroyed.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.609
- But...
-  <i>No.</i>

07:57.611 --> 07:59.811
I'm just gonna be trying
a new technique on him.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.048
But in order for it to work,
I need you all to participate.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.517
You're gonna be taking
placebo pills.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.519
<i>I'm gonna tell ed</i>
<i>that it's been proven</i>

08:07.521 --> 08:09.254
To decrease anger
and negativity

08:09.256 --> 08:12.591
While filling you with
a sense of euphoria and love
for your fellow man.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.559
- Like ecstasy.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.761
I guess we're pretending
that there are similar
qualities, sure.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.231
Well, why can't you
just give us ecstasy?

08:19.233 --> 08:20.699
Because it's illegal

08:20.701 --> 08:22.734
And I'm not gonna
hand out any real drugs.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.270
That you've been taking it
for a week and it works.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.972
I have a better idea.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.974
Why don't you give ed
the sugar pill

08:28.976 --> 08:32.244
And we'll take
the ecstasy?

08:32.246 --> 08:35.180
( sighs )
I'm not giving
anybody ecstasy.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.748
<i>You're all taking</i>
<i>sugar pills.</i>

08:36.750 --> 08:38.650
It's called
deception therapy.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.886
But the only way it works
is if you all participate.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.188
One more question.

08:43.190 --> 08:47.592
Will this placebo
react badly with my ecstasy?

08:49.295 --> 08:52.831
Ed.
Perfect timing.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.633
I was just checking
the results of the new pills

08:54.635 --> 08:56.668
I gave the group after
you left early last week.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.903
What kind of pills?

08:57.905 --> 09:00.872
It's a pill that actually
reduces anger

09:00.874 --> 09:03.108
While promoting feelings
of love and tolerance.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.976
I'd love for you to be
part of the test group.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.312
We're seeing great results.
Just ask patrick.

09:09.181 --> 09:11.950
Well, uh,
I started a week ago

09:11.952 --> 09:15.086
And I have
never felt happier.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.821
Which kind of happy?

09:16.823 --> 09:18.823
I just got
cher tickets happy

09:18.825 --> 09:22.193
Or I just met the queer guy
from "glee" happy?

09:22.195 --> 09:23.862
( laughs )

09:23.864 --> 09:26.631
Oh, edward.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.767
You see?
Patrick's a totally
different person.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.770
But this one's gay, too.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.105
All right,
maybe I will try

09:34.107 --> 09:36.841
As long as it
doesn't interfere with
my cholesterol medicine.

09:36.843 --> 09:39.010
- It won't.
- What about my blood
pressure pills?

09:39.012 --> 09:41.746
- Absolutely not.
- My prostate pills?

09:41.748 --> 09:44.149
Antifungal?
Blood thinner?

09:44.151 --> 09:46.685
Restless leg?
Sleepy leg?

09:46.687 --> 09:49.921
No, I'm pretty sure
this is one that just
blends in with the crowd.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.591
All right.
You've sold me on it.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.693
I'll go get some water.

09:54.695 --> 09:58.597
Because if it doesn't,
I'll probably lose my wife,

09:58.599 --> 10:01.333
My house, and everything
that's dear to me.

10:01.335 --> 10:04.836
Mmm, sugary.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.242
I just got your text.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.945
Please don't make me
go out with jen.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.047
Just once.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.250
Otherwise she wants
to hang out with both of us
on our playdate nights.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.186
And that's worse.
Right?

10:22.121 --> 10:24.122
Right.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.690
I can't do it.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.192
I hate lying to jen
about us.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.260
It makes me feel
like a creep.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.262
Look, you and I were
just friends back when jen
and I were still married.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.231
If she finds out
we're sleeping
together now,

10:33.233 --> 10:35.200
She'll never believe
we weren't doing it
back then.

10:35.202 --> 10:39.104
Even if that's true,
jen and I have nothing
in common.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.873
It'll be way better than
her trying to hang out

10:41.875 --> 10:43.708
With us on the nights
we want to have sex.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.144
Right?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.946
Let me know.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.651
All right.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.185
How are those pills
working out for everybody?

10:54.187 --> 10:55.387
- Awesome.
- Great.

10:56.355 --> 10:57.922
Ed?

11:00.292 --> 11:03.228
I'm so happy
I could kiss all of you.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.264
Ed, what's happening
to your face?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.266
Are you having
some kind of a stroke?

11:08.268 --> 11:10.368
Oh, my god.
You're smiling.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.405
Yeah.
I've never been so happy.

11:13.407 --> 11:16.207
I was pulling out of
the home depot last night

11:16.209 --> 11:18.276
And somebody blocked me in.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.911
But I didn't get
pissed off.

11:19.913 --> 11:23.114
I just sat in my car
and watched two mexicans

11:23.116 --> 11:24.683
Eat shaved ice.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.252
It was beautiful.

11:27.254 --> 11:31.322
Actually, ed,
I think any ethnicity

11:31.324 --> 11:33.358
Eating shaved ice
is beautiful.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.860
That is a good thought,
patrick.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.800
Oh, before we start,
my wife and I

11:41.802 --> 11:45.203
Are having a little shindig
for our 40th this weekend

11:45.205 --> 11:47.305
And she asked me
to invite my friends.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.908
I look around this room

11:49.910 --> 11:52.177
And that's all I see.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.845
I'd be honored to come.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.247
And I'm sure everybody else
would be as well.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.882
- No, I can't.
- I have plans.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.385
I'm bleeding.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.320
That's too bad.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.456
You remember
that brother-in-law
I told you about?

12:04.458 --> 12:06.758
The one I went after
with a machete

12:06.760 --> 12:09.127
In that game of horseshoes
a couple of years ago.

12:09.129 --> 12:13.031
Well, I feel so good
that I've invited him

12:13.033 --> 12:15.100
And we're gonna finish
that game of horseshoes.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.736
- Yeah, I could make that.
- I would like to come.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.105
- That's fine.
- Ed, ed, this is amazing.

12:20.107 --> 12:23.308
He triggered probably
your worst blackout rage.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.843
I'll tell you, charlie,
he makes me mad.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.946
Well, used to.
But I feel like a new man now.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.948
And I'd just like to say
thank you.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.283
- You're welcome, ed.
- Not to you.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.352
To the guy that invented
those pills.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.055
Now if the pill can only
do something

12:37.057 --> 12:38.423
About my damn prostate.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.361
This is fantastic.

12:43.363 --> 12:47.098
Ed is on the verge
of a tremendous
breakthrough.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.901
We are about to witness
the power of the human mind

12:49.903 --> 12:52.403
Overcoming years
of hostility and anger.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.439
Yeah, and we're probably
gonna get to watch him

12:54.441 --> 12:56.841
Kill his brother-in-law
with a horseshoe.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.546
And that's why
I'm convinced

13:01.548 --> 13:05.350
That my little hungarian
grandmother on the way
to ellis island

13:05.352 --> 13:07.118
Invented the body shot.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.320
( laughs )

13:09.322 --> 13:11.990
Could we have
a little more
wine over here?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.291
You know,
I have to be honest.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.326
I was a bit hesitant
to go out with you.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.229
I just don't have
a lot of luck hanging
out with women.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.398
Really?
Me, too.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.233
It's the way we look,
isn't it?

13:22.235 --> 13:23.535
I don't know what it is.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.837
But most women
think I'm a bitch.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.273
I know I did.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.075
What did you think of me?

13:31.077 --> 13:34.245
I thought you were so hot,
you had to be stupid.

13:35.214 --> 13:37.348
That is so sweet.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.083
No, I mean it.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.418
Well, I believe you,

13:40.420 --> 13:42.353
'cause, you know,
you're a lesbian.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.489
- Jennifer.
- Yeah?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.225
Take a drink.
You're gonna need it.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.459
Are you gonna hit on me?

13:48.461 --> 13:50.929
Wait.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.365
Okay, go.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.335
- I'm not gay anymore.
- Oh!

13:58.904 --> 14:00.138
What happened?

14:00.140 --> 14:02.874
I was never strictly gay.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.176
And now
I'm officially not.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.312
Oh, was it a tragic affair

14:07.314 --> 14:09.314
With some girl
who broke your heart?

14:09.316 --> 14:12.250
Or did you just miss
the banging?

14:12.252 --> 14:15.119
The banging.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.855
This is perfect.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.457
Listen, you're looking
for a guy, I'm looking
for a guy.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.492
We could go
hunting together.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.328
( gasps )
we're cougars.

14:25.097 --> 14:26.397
You don't want
to hang out with me.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.266
I'm an academic.
I'm really not
a lot of fun.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.502
- That's what charlie said.
- Really?

14:31.504 --> 14:34.272
Yeah, but, you know, I bet
under all that black stuff

14:34.274 --> 14:37.275
Is somebody who wants to
bust out and have a good time.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.409
Here's the deal.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.179
Thursday, el tostada
on ventura boulevard,

14:41.181 --> 14:43.181
Half-price
skinny margaritas.

14:43.183 --> 14:46.351
You like musicians?
Because there's a guitar
store down the block

14:46.353 --> 14:48.319
And a bunch of those dudes
come in.

14:48.321 --> 14:51.022
Oh, that is definitely
something

14:51.024 --> 14:53.291
I would only do
with you.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.660
Then, to us.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.262
Meow!

14:57.264 --> 14:59.163
( laughs )

14:59.165 --> 15:01.065
Yeah, don't do that.

15:02.468 --> 15:05.236
<i>( music playing )</i>

15:07.072 --> 15:09.374
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.142
- Hell of a time
finding this place.
- Me, too.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.177
I put "white racist guy"
in my gps,

15:13.179 --> 15:15.179
This whole side
of town lit up.

15:15.181 --> 15:19.017
I know.
Pretty sure I drove past
a white angus steakhouse.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.219
Lacey and I
just got here, too.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.488
We had to stop and buy
some vitamins from her friend

15:23.490 --> 15:25.123
In a burger king
parking lot.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.925
That's worrisome.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.361
Hey, there's ed.
We should go over
and give him a hug.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.498
Wait, we should give
each other a hug.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.667
Are you drunk?

15:35.669 --> 15:37.435
No, I'm just on ecstasy.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.672
But I did wash it down
with a mojito.

15:42.207 --> 15:43.508
We'll talk about
this in group.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.410
Yes, we will
and for the rest
of our lives.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.546
I'm dancing away.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.050
Hey, charlie.
Glad you could make it.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.985
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't have missed it.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.420
- How's everything going?
- Oh, pretty good.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.989
Wife's happy.
Come here.

15:57.991 --> 16:00.625
I need to ask you
a question.

16:00.627 --> 16:04.062
Is it safe to take
two of these in one day?

16:04.064 --> 16:06.230
Sure.
It says as needed.

16:07.599 --> 16:10.134
Good, because here comes
that son of a bitch again.

16:10.136 --> 16:14.706
Come on, tell me where
you're hiding the good
scotch, you cheap bastard.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.307
Hi there.
I'm charlie.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.376
You must be ray,
ed's brother-in-law.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.112
That's who I am.
Thanks, I almost forgot.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.413
Jerkoff.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.251
No, seriously.
It's good to meet you.

16:27.253 --> 16:30.521
Ray, these are
friends of mine.
This is a party.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.491
I'd appreciate it if you'd
make a little effort.

16:33.493 --> 16:38.029
And who among us wouldn't
be better off by making
a little effort?

16:38.031 --> 16:40.164
Wait a minute.
I know who you are.
You're ed's shrink.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.266
- That's right.
- Well, congratulations.

16:42.268 --> 16:45.169
You turned him
into a real puss.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.171
I tried to take him
on a hunting trip.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.173
He said, "no.
Too many anger triggers."

16:49.175 --> 16:51.009
Puss!

16:51.011 --> 16:53.311
Ed, weren't you gonna
show me around the house?

16:53.313 --> 16:55.046
No.

16:55.048 --> 16:58.049
Yeah, give him a tour
of casa disappointment.

16:58.051 --> 17:01.219
And after that,
I want to finish
that game of horseshoes.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.254
I've been waiting a long time
to kick your butt.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.289
You got it, ray.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.625
Ed, ed, ed.
Can I talk to you
for a second?

17:10.129 --> 17:12.130
Ed.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.098
Look, you've been
doing a great job.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.200
But now it's time to walk
away from this guy.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.770
I can handle this.
I just need to take
a few more of these pills.

17:18.772 --> 17:22.507
Look, ray is beyond
what these can handle.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.144
Truth is they're--
they're sugar pills, ed.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.146
They're placebos.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.114
You've been giving me
sugar pills?

17:30.116 --> 17:31.682
Well, here's the best part.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.285
That means you've been
controlling your anger
on your own.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.522
You used to be ed
the angry old guy.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.591
Now you're ed
the old guy.

17:42.127 --> 17:45.430
And everybody knew
about this but me?

17:45.432 --> 17:48.332
I feel like
a damn fool.

17:48.334 --> 17:51.702
You've got about 10 seconds
to get off my property.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.072
Ed.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.075
Ed, ed, you're not a fool.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.510
You've had a breakthrough.
So why don't we just
enjoy the party

17:59.512 --> 18:01.179
And we'll talk about this
Tuesday in group?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.713
What do I need group for?

18:02.715 --> 18:07.085
You just said that
I can control my own
anger on my own.

18:07.087 --> 18:11.122
I'm changing my mind.
Pack up the guns and booze.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.423
We're going hunting.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.292
All right.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.697
So it didn't go well?

18:19.699 --> 18:21.833
Hey, for a placebo test,
it went very well.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.535
Usually half the group gets
heart disease or cancer.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.304
Ed didn't get any of that.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.606
But you lost a patient
because you tricked him.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.775
I know, I know.
He doesn't trust me anymore.
I get it.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.611
So why do you think you went
so far to help this guy?

18:33.613 --> 18:36.347
Good question.

18:39.818 --> 18:42.386
Well, does he remind
you of anyone?

18:42.388 --> 18:45.289
I don't know.
Just another old guy
like my dad.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.291
Real stubborn.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.393
Won't listen to anyone
like my dad.

18:49.395 --> 18:50.862
<i>Drinks a little.</i>

18:50.864 --> 18:54.732
Doesn't respect me,
you know, like my dad.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.834
You know who
he reminds me of?

18:56.836 --> 18:59.837
- Wilford brimley.
- Stop it.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.840
You know, ever since
your father came back
into your life,

19:02.842 --> 19:05.810
You've been extremely
frustrated with him.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.912
And you've transferred
your need to change your dad

19:07.914 --> 19:10.414
Into another
stubborn old guy-- ed.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.617
You're not going
to change ed,

19:12.619 --> 19:15.186
So break this pattern.
Let him go.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.854
You're right.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.422
I'm gonna go get ed back.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.460
<i>( knocking )</i>

19:24.229 --> 19:25.730
What do you want?

19:25.732 --> 19:28.533
I want to apologize.

19:31.203 --> 19:34.305
One of my jobs
as your therapist is
to help build your trust.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.607
And in this case,
I feel like I might have

19:36.609 --> 19:38.609
Taken advantage of it.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.212
So you want me
to come back, I guess.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.813
Yes, I do.

19:42.815 --> 19:48.452
Just the chance to
make your life free from
the emotional turmoil

19:48.454 --> 19:51.255
That's followed you
around like a black dog
for the last 70 years.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.891
Not enough.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.927
I want a discount.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.728
20%.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.330
This set me way back.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.666
You're right,
it was a horrible setback

20:01.668 --> 20:04.202
And I am responsible.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.638
But I'm seeing this
as more of a 10% setback.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.840
10's fair.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.943
I'll just grab my sweater.

20:11.945 --> 20:14.645
Oh, and I need
your sigmund freud
on that.

20:15.914 --> 20:18.316
Ed, this is from
the superior court
of los angeles.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.918
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.422
They said if I don't want
to go to jail, I've got to go
back to anger management.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.959
You tried to kill
your brother-in-law?

20:27.961 --> 20:31.429
No. I just took him
deer hunting.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.863
We got in the middle
of the woods

20:32.865 --> 20:35.833
And I made him put
some antlers on his head

20:35.835 --> 20:40.304
And run through the forest
making deer noises.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.540
Okay. Wow.

20:42.542 --> 20:45.009
Many questions.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.845
Why would he agree
to that?

20:47.847 --> 20:49.647
A man will agree
to a lot

20:49.649 --> 20:52.450
If a gun's pointed
at his nuts.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.419
So legally you had
to come back anyway.

20:55.421 --> 20:58.422
Yep.
Tricked you.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.625
Feels good, don't it?

21:02.394 --> 21:04.929
Oh, ed,
just one more thing.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.865
You said you made your
brother-in-law run around
and make deer noises.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.935
Just exactly what does
a deer sound like?

21:10.937 --> 21:13.971
Well, in this case,
it was, "help me! Help me!

21:13.973 --> 21:15.940
I'm a man, not a deer!"

21:17.576 --> 21:20.344
Thanks.
That was bugging me.
