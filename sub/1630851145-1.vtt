We got a worldwide audience,

everything they should be,

15:30.995 --> 15:33.631
we doing a hundred thousand
digital hits a week,

15:33.664 --> 15:35.399
I think it's time I walked in
there

15:35.432 --> 15:38.069
and asked Niko to
renegotiate that contract.

15:38.102 --> 15:39.270
Renegotiate?

15:40.270 --> 15:42.306
Man, you know as well as I do,

15:42.340 --> 15:45.677
Niko is not going for
no kinda renegotiating.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.179
Once the deal is done, it's
done man.

15:47.211 --> 15:49.747
No, every deal can be
renegotiated.

15:49.780 --> 15:51.716
It all depends on who's
negotiating

15:51.750 --> 15:54.152
and who's willing to give up
what.

15:54.184 --> 15:56.621
I don't know why
y'all wanna rock the boat.

15:57.455 --> 15:59.591

16:03.927 --> 16:05.697

trouble.

16:05.730 --> 16:07.932
No, I'm just
asking for what's fair.

16:08.732 --> 16:10.268
You know what I'm saying?

16:10.934 --> 16:12.269
I mean come on look at this,

16:12.302 --> 16:15.173

a record contract,

16:15.206 --> 16:18.777

16:34.058 --> 16:35.526

new record

19:25.496 --> 19:28.200

climbing the charts rapidly.

19:28.232 --> 19:29.466
I mean it's bowing up man.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.170
All over Australia, the UK,

19:32.103 --> 19:33.479

are jumping

19:33.503 --> 19:34.972

19:35.006 --> 19:39.277
Man, I just can't believe the
success of this record man,

19:39.309 --> 19:40.211

19:40.244 --> 19:41.812

There it is.

19:51.189 --> 19:52.824
Appreciate it.

19:52.856 --> 19:53.892
Thank you.

19:53.924 --> 19:54.893
You sure you wouldn't want

19:54.925 --> 19:56.461
a water or anything?

19:56.827 --> 19:57.827
I said I'm straight.

20:00.964 --> 20:03.734
Hey man, red is our manager.

20:03.768 --> 20:05.504
Why they didn't let him up in
here dude?

20:07.305 --> 20:09.274
Sweetheart, would you give us
a minute?

20:09.307 --> 20:10.684
I'll be right outside if you
need me.

20:10.708 --> 20:11.708
Excellent.

20:16.180 --> 20:17.380
All right, let's keep it real.

20:18.215 --> 20:20.150
Red ain't do shit.

20:20.183 --> 20:22.453
Now what red did is brought you
to me,

20:22.487 --> 20:24.689
but do you have any idea

20:24.721 --> 20:27.826
of the amount of lawyers, time,
money,

20:27.858 --> 20:31.295
and promotional teams, and
agents that we have behind y'all

20:31.328 --> 20:32.529
to push your brand?

20:32.563 --> 20:35.333
Look man, red's the one got
us here.

20:35.365 --> 20:36.201
Period.

20:36.233 --> 20:38.135
Yes he did, red got you here.

20:38.169 --> 20:39.771
Red got you through the door.

20:39.804 --> 20:41.206
My door.

20:41.239 --> 20:43.173
But I'm the one that got y'all
to the top.

20:43.207 --> 20:44.709
I'm the one that got y'all
sitting

20:44.741 --> 20:46.344
the way y'all sitting right now.

20:46.376 --> 20:47.620
I'm the one that hired the
street teams

20:47.644 --> 20:48.980
to push your record.

20:49.012 --> 20:51.048
Paid off the DJs to spin your
record.

20:51.082 --> 20:53.451
I'm the one that got y'all
to the top of the charts.

20:53.483 --> 20:55.486
Now red is a good dude,

20:55.519 --> 20:57.288
he will get a nice
little severance package

20:57.321 --> 20:58.866
and he will be on his mother
fucking way.

20:58.890 --> 20:59.691
Where was you at

20:59.723 --> 21:00.692
when we didn't have nothing man?

21:00.724 --> 21:01.724
Red was there man.

21:02.059 --> 21:03.060
Red did it man.

21:03.094 --> 21:04.062
You didn't have nothing?

21:04.095 --> 21:05.163
He was there for you.

21:05.195 --> 21:05.963
We didn't have nothing.

21:05.997 --> 21:06.730
All right, all right.

21:06.763 --> 21:07.531
Period dude.

21:07.565 --> 21:08.866
That's fine.

21:10.567 --> 21:11.567
Trusted,

21:13.604 --> 21:16.374
what's bothering you right
now is your conscience,

21:16.406 --> 21:18.542
loyalty, but feed on this,

21:20.278 --> 21:24.048
last year Taylor swift, Jay z,
kanye west,

21:24.082 --> 21:27.386
they made a hundred million
dollars after taxes.

21:29.053 --> 21:31.923
Hell, this year they gone
make another hundred million.

21:31.955 --> 21:33.057
And the year after that.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.928
So what you have to ask yourself

21:36.961 --> 21:39.064
is how much is your loyalty
worth

21:39.096 --> 21:41.665
to have riches that you can
never spend?

21:41.699 --> 21:44.536
Your children's children's
children

21:44.568 --> 21:46.404
will never have to worry about
a dime.

21:48.405 --> 21:51.175
Hell, if it really bothers you
that much

21:51.209 --> 21:54.078
you can take care of red
for the rest of his life.

21:55.747 --> 21:57.816
I ain't sacrificing shit.

22:02.386 --> 22:04.955
Yeah well, I still got you
right.

22:06.022 --> 22:07.022
That's real.

22:09.794 --> 22:11.196
He'll come around.

22:13.131 --> 22:14.800
He got no choice.

22:18.135 --> 22:19.837
That's crazy man.

22:20.304 --> 22:22.173
So what's your plan man?

22:22.205 --> 22:24.809
Man, I got the same plan as
I had when I went in there.

22:25.308 --> 22:26.308
You know?

22:27.111 --> 22:30.749
I definitely ain't no rapper
like you, so.

22:30.781 --> 22:33.150
Man, you had some of the
hardest shit around here man.

22:33.183 --> 22:34.853
Come on man.

22:34.885 --> 22:36.019

42:24.306 --> 42:25.841
Been all right man, you know.

42:25.875 --> 42:27.035
I'm trying to make it happen.

42:36.119 --> 42:38.789
My kind of man, house full
of women

42:38.822 --> 42:40.657
and you'd rather be out here
by yourself.

42:41.891 --> 42:44.327
I ain't come here for no women.

42:44.994 --> 42:46.797
I came to just talk to you man.

42:46.829 --> 42:49.032
What you wanna talk to me about?

42:49.065 --> 42:51.168
Business, same reason you
invited me.

42:52.902 --> 42:54.412
All right, I see you a
man that don't waste words,

42:54.436 --> 42:56.406
so I'm gone get right to the po.

42:57.673 --> 42:59.942
You crew's making big waves,

42:59.976 --> 43:01.811
big enough to go international.

43:01.844 --> 43:03.713
You know what I'm saying?

43:03.746 --> 43:05.949
So my question to you is,

43:05.981 --> 43:07.750
are you content with just
selling records

43:07.784 --> 43:08.719
out the trunk of your car,

43:08.751 --> 43:10.753
or you ready to go
international too?

43:10.786 --> 43:11.821
What you think?

43:12.588 --> 43:14.991
I think you a man I
can do business with.

43:15.625 --> 43:17.769
See a lot of people don't know
what this business is about,

43:17.793 --> 43:19.395
it's about making money,

43:19.429 --> 43:22.298
it's about making millions
of dollars in investments

43:22.331 --> 43:24.434
and getting good return on
those millions.

43:24.934 --> 43:26.769
It's about executing a game plan

43:26.802 --> 43:27.947
and doing whatever you gotta do

43:27.971 --> 43:30.239
to make sure that game plan is
successful.

43:30.273 --> 43:33.076
Sacrificing whoever you got to
sacrifice.

43:33.108 --> 43:35.144
It's also about a higher power.

43:35.378 --> 43:38.615
You know my daddy once told me

43:38.648 --> 43:42.486
don't dance with the devil unless
you're ready to burn in hell.

43:43.353 --> 43:46.123
I know all about you,
red told me.

43:46.655 --> 43:47.824
Good old red.

43:48.791 --> 43:52.161
You get people life, signed,

43:52.195 --> 43:54.597
mother fuckers getting money
and shit

43:54.630 --> 43:57.000
but at the same time you
destroy em,

43:57.032 --> 43:59.469
I ain't got no problem with
that.

43:59.501 --> 44:02.538
The issue ain't whether or
not you wanna fuck with me.

44:02.572 --> 44:04.875
It's whether or not I wanna
fuck with you.

44:05.875 --> 44:08.144
Spoken like a true businessman.

44:08.177 --> 44:10.189
Now if everybody did business
the right way like you,

44:10.213 --> 44:12.816
I'd be a billionaire several
times over.

44:12.849 --> 44:14.951
Everything ain't about money.

44:14.983 --> 44:16.719
Fair enough.

44:16.753 --> 44:19.657
So tell me, can we do
business together or what?

44:21.858 --> 44:23.594
Let me think about it.

44:24.094 --> 44:25.628
You do that.

44:31.701 --> 44:33.713
Yeah man so, just out there
trying to make it happen,

44:33.737 --> 44:35.539
make the marks like you said.

44:35.572 --> 44:36.807
You know what I mean?

44:36.840 --> 44:38.842
Just doing what we do,
you know what I mean?

44:38.875 --> 44:39.876
Bro, let's go.

44:39.909 --> 44:40.876

44:40.909 --> 44:42.178

44:43.346 --> 44:45.181
Man, we just got here,
what you tripping for?

44:45.215 --> 44:46.583
This ain't what you think it is.

44:46.615 --> 44:48.093
Man, stop thinking someone's
always out to get you.

44:48.117 --> 44:50.019
Just relax man.

44:50.052 --> 44:51.062
Look, if you gotta go man look,

44:51.086 --> 44:52.389
you can take the keys to the
car.

44:52.422 --> 44:53.422

44:54.423 --> 44:55.492

44:55.525 --> 44:56.960

44:57.594 --> 44:59.063
Let's go!

46:43.398 --> 46:46.802

46:46.835 --> 46:49.672

47:02.418 --> 47:03.487
That's what's up.

47:03.853 --> 47:05.331
Temptation, why don't you
take him into the red room

47:05.355 --> 47:06.757
and let him enjoy himself.

47:12.829 --> 47:14.305
Doing big things, won't
you park that thing over here

47:14.329 --> 47:15.833

47:22.438 --> 47:24.240
Yeah, that's more comfortable

48:04.746 --> 48:05.982
Get up!

48:12.054 --> 48:12.788
Ah shit.

48:12.822 --> 48:14.590
What time is it?

48:14.623 --> 48:16.458

48:16.492 --> 48:17.894
Pants on the floor and shit man.

Where's my shirt at?

48:19.429 --> 48:20.297

48:20.329 --> 48:21.831

Hell of a night last night huh?

48:45.822 --> 48:47.856
Glad y'all enjoyed it.

48:47.889 --> 48:50.626
Corey, can I have a word
with you for a second?

48:50.659 --> 48:52.828
Uh, I'll meet you outside.

48:59.869 --> 49:02.137
I wanna show you something man,

49:02.170 --> 49:04.050
but first I gotta say
welcome to the family man.

49:05.807 --> 49:07.309
Before you get up outta here
man,

49:07.342 --> 49:09.022
I really gotta show
you these pictures man.

49:09.644 --> 49:11.715
It's amazing with technology
today.

49:11.748 --> 49:12.983
Go on and take a look.

49:14.416 --> 49:15.685
Go ahead.

49:17.887 --> 49:19.055
Yeah.

49:19.088 --> 49:20.957
Facebook, Internet.

49:20.989 --> 49:24.260
Footage like that could
either make you or break you.

49:25.327 --> 49:26.563
Internet gone be blowing up.

49:29.664 --> 49:31.735
I'm sure we have an
understanding now right?

49:31.768 --> 49:34.338
Oh yeah, but like I said,
welcome to the family.

49:36.606 --> 49:40.243
Here's a little token of our
appreciation.

49:41.443 --> 49:43.380
Go on, that's you.

49:45.681 --> 49:46.883
I'll see you around brother.

49:53.523 --> 49:54.557
Oh.

49:55.358 --> 49:56.860
Got to be more careful.

50:00.963 --> 50:02.098
Are you uh?

50:02.130 --> 50:04.567
I don't ever wanna talk about
it again.

50:04.599 --> 50:06.368
Ever.

50:06.402 --> 50:07.637
You understand me?

50:09.105 --> 50:09.873
What's this?

50:09.905 --> 50:11.240
Whose chain is this?

50:12.442 --> 50:13.442
What's that?

50:14.610 --> 50:15.878
Niko gave it to me.

50:15.911 --> 50:17.279
What's in it?

50:17.313 --> 50:18.515
I don't know.

50:18.547 --> 50:20.082
I'm not sure if I wanna know.

50:20.115 --> 50:21.217
Give it here.

50:29.257 --> 50:30.125
Oh shit.

50:30.159 --> 50:31.159
Oh my god.

50:32.829 --> 50:35.365
That's like 60, 70 thousand
dollars.

50:35.398 --> 50:37.100
What's it for?

50:37.132 --> 50:38.132
For us.

50:45.340 --> 50:47.340
I've never seen this much
money at one time before.

50:48.077 --> 50:49.779
Neither have I.

50:49.811 --> 50:50.811
Man.

50:56.918 --> 50:58.121
What's this?

51:03.960 --> 51:06.028
Is that what I think it is?

52:14.931 --> 52:17.032
Hey, I say we go all the way

52:17.065 --> 52:18.567
and put something on the table.

52:19.068 --> 52:22.472
Listen man, we have to
keep our independence.

52:22.505 --> 52:24.340
Our independence is the only
thing

52:24.373 --> 52:27.309
that gives us the power
to negotiate a deal

52:27.342 --> 52:30.012
that's good for us and
not good for the company.

52:30.045 --> 52:31.580
Man come on, I hear you but

52:31.614 --> 52:34.083
you know how rappers looking
for an offer like this?

52:34.115 --> 52:36.186
Thousands upon thousands.

52:36.219 --> 52:37.854
Come on, the market is oversatud

52:37.887 --> 52:39.222
with rappers right now man.

52:39.255 --> 52:41.023
I know we gonna get fucked but

52:41.056 --> 52:43.692
at least it puts us in a
position to move forward.

52:43.726 --> 52:46.563
Corey, I'm trying to tell
you something from experience.

52:47.963 --> 52:49.199
Signing a deal with Niko

52:49.231 --> 52:50.833
is like signing a deal with the
devil,

52:50.865 --> 52:52.735
it's not worth the paper it's
written on.

52:52.768 --> 52:55.070
Man, who else is gonna
give us an advance?

52:55.103 --> 52:56.172
Promotion?

52:56.204 --> 52:58.173
International distribution?

52:58.206 --> 52:59.383
The money we get fucked out of
for sales

52:59.407 --> 53:02.045
we can make back in
touring and merchandising.

53:02.077 --> 53:03.512
Shit at least we'll be in the
house,

53:03.545 --> 53:04.780
we'll be in the game.

53:04.813 --> 53:07.683
Hey look man, both
of y'all making great points.

53:07.717 --> 53:11.454
Red, I don't like Niko
ass no more than you.

53:11.487 --> 53:14.423
But who is giving out deals
like Niko, red.

53:14.456 --> 53:15.558
Who?

53:16.291 --> 53:18.527
You know, I ain't getting no
younger.

53:18.561 --> 53:21.431
I'm getting fucked already
anyway.

53:21.463 --> 53:25.134
Who else offering us a
chance at the big time?

53:25.166 --> 53:30.739
Guns, all I'm saying is
just give me some time.

53:30.773 --> 53:33.242
Let me see if I can't bring
a better deal to the table.

53:33.275 --> 53:35.077
I see why trusted
and liquid fired you.

53:35.110 --> 53:36.612
You afraid to pull the trigger.

53:36.646 --> 53:38.981
Boy, don't ever question
my courage or my credibility,

53:39.014 --> 53:40.415
ever, never!

53:40.449 --> 53:41.784
Man come on man.

53:41.817 --> 53:45.288
Hey look man, this is
business, it's not personal.

53:45.320 --> 53:46.822
Come on.

53:46.856 --> 53:50.827
Red, I know you got our
best interests at heart man

53:50.860 --> 53:53.262
and I appreciate you for that
man.

53:53.295 --> 53:54.663
But I gotta roll with my
brother.

53:54.697 --> 53:56.666
Man!

53:56.699 --> 53:58.969
Just give me a little more time.

54:00.036 --> 54:03.505
Call dark productions, make
the deal.

55:24.920 --> 55:26.155
Hello red.

55:26.188 --> 55:27.523
Mr. Niko will see you now.

55:37.233 --> 55:39.268
My man red.

55:39.300 --> 55:41.036
It's been a long time brother.

55:41.070 --> 55:42.271
How you been?

55:42.304 --> 55:43.039
Can I get you anything?

55:43.072 --> 55:44.039
I'm fine.

55:44.072 --> 55:45.040
You good?

55:45.074 --> 55:46.275
Yeah.

55:46.307 --> 55:47.409
All right well uh,

55:47.443 --> 55:49.211
to what do I owe this pleasure?

55:51.447 --> 55:52.916
We gotta talk man.

55:54.215 --> 55:55.551
In private.

55:56.552 --> 55:57.787
Give us a second baby?

55:57.820 --> 55:58.888
Certainly.

56:08.329 --> 56:10.599
Talk to me, what's on your mind?

56:11.666 --> 56:15.105
I'm not gonna let you take
advantage of my boys, Niko.

56:15.838 --> 56:17.807
What in the world are
you talking about man?

56:17.840 --> 56:19.475
You know what I'm talking about.

56:19.507 --> 56:21.710
All that I'm a make you a star

56:21.744 --> 56:24.514
and then fuck you in the ass
at the same time bullshit.

56:24.980 --> 56:26.892
You been fucking over
people for a long time Niko,

56:26.916 --> 56:28.918
that shit stops here.

56:30.452 --> 56:31.954
How you plan to stop me?

56:32.621 --> 56:33.389
I don't think you remember

56:33.422 --> 56:35.358
how long we been doing business.

56:35.990 --> 56:38.661
All the secrets you let me
in on.

56:38.693 --> 56:39.829
Yeah.

56:41.297 --> 56:44.500
That cash investment you got
from them Detroit drug dealers

56:44.532 --> 56:47.103
that you didn't report to the
IRS,

56:47.135 --> 56:49.773
I think that's called
money laundering isn't it?

56:50.806 --> 56:52.974
That little drug
trafficking thing you did,

56:53.007 --> 56:54.977
crossing state lines.

56:55.376 --> 56:56.945
I mean you weren't there, but

56:56.978 --> 56:59.348
I think they can still
get you on the rico right?

57:03.985 --> 57:05.721
So you mean to tell
me you have documents

57:05.753 --> 57:08.190
from 30 years ago?

57:08.224 --> 57:11.394
I've copied plenty of
documents Niko.

57:14.563 --> 57:15.731
Okay.

57:16.865 --> 57:18.735
I think you got me red.

57:19.534 --> 57:21.303
What do you propose we do to uh,

57:21.336 --> 57:23.873
settle this little
misunderstanding?

57:23.905 --> 57:27.476
Well first, we gone
renegotiate they contract.

57:27.510 --> 57:31.080
We gone make sure they get
better shares in the publishing,

57:31.112 --> 57:34.216
and then I want open face
on the accounting books.

57:34.250 --> 57:36.052
No more hiding money.

57:38.119 --> 57:40.255
You got me over a barrel.

57:41.190 --> 57:42.190
It's a deal.

57:46.262 --> 57:47.730
Temptation.

57:47.762 --> 57:49.364
Yes Mr. Niko?

57:49.398 --> 57:51.567
Bring me down a fresh contract,

57:51.599 --> 57:53.768
and also a pad and a
paper for some dictation.

57:53.802 --> 57:54.802
Yes sir.

57:56.405 --> 57:57.940
Helluva move you pulled there
boy,

57:57.972 --> 57:59.608
I didn't think you had it in
you.

57:59.641 --> 58:02.410
Sometimes you gotta
do what you gotta do.

58:02.443 --> 58:03.443
I hear that.

58:04.045 --> 58:05.356
What makes you think I wouldn't
kill you

58:05.380 --> 58:07.049
for doing something like that?

58:09.985 --> 58:13.122
You know I got people
with them documents, Niko.

58:13.556 --> 58:16.525
Just in case I happen to
disappear, or

58:16.559 --> 58:18.461
my untimely demise.

58:19.427 --> 58:21.597
You covered all your bases.

58:22.063 --> 58:23.965
We're gonna have to rewrite tha
contract.

58:23.998 --> 58:25.600
It's gone be a lot of work.

58:25.634 --> 58:28.637
Listen, why don't you fix me
one of your special drinks.

58:28.670 --> 58:30.105
In fact, while you're at it,

58:30.139 --> 58:31.816
won't you make one for
our friend here too.

58:31.840 --> 58:34.777
Yeah, I'll have one with you.

58:35.411 --> 58:37.079
My man red.

58:42.117 --> 58:43.753
Through it all brother.

58:44.286 --> 58:46.255
You know I respect you.

58:47.789 --> 58:50.192
I know your wife, your daughter.

58:50.826 --> 58:52.604
Remember I went to your
daughter's graduation.

58:52.628 --> 58:54.163
Yeah, I remember.

58:57.800 --> 58:59.035
Thank you.

59:00.268 --> 59:01.537
Cheers.

59:06.842 --> 59:08.478
Yeah that's tasty.

59:10.878 --> 59:13.181
Hm, man we've come a long way.

59:13.215 --> 59:16.652
Remember that first show
we did, was it Omaha?

59:16.684 --> 59:19.121
Curtis blue, run dmc?

59:20.822 --> 59:22.533
Yeah, I think a hundred
people showed up to that.

59:22.557 --> 59:24.126
Hm, we lost thousands.

59:25.360 --> 59:27.195
And what about that fat boy
show?

59:27.228 --> 59:29.006
Yeah, I think we lost
our shirts on that one too,

59:29.030 --> 59:30.030
didn't we?

59:31.032 --> 59:32.032
Ah man.

59:32.668 --> 59:35.438
And now look where the
record business is man.

59:35.471 --> 59:37.173
Rap is worldwide.

59:38.806 --> 59:41.643
We broke our backs to get
this thing of ours done man.

59:42.878 --> 59:44.380
Which is why it makes it so
difficult

59:44.413 --> 59:46.748
that you would try to tear
down everything I built.

59:48.817 --> 59:50.885
I mean, I gotta tell you
something.

59:50.918 --> 59:52.954
All that evidence you talking
bout,

59:52.987 --> 59:56.024
them documents, completely
worthless.

59:56.391 --> 59:59.794
That drug cartel with the
trafficking and all that,

59:59.827 --> 1:00:01.197
they're nonexistent.

1:00:02.030 --> 1:00:05.032
That whole story is completely
fabricated.

1:00:05.034 --> 1:00:07.068
I set it out there as a little
trap,

1:00:07.101 --> 1:00:10.505
see if you'd bite as a weakness,

1:00:10.539 --> 1:00:13.209
that's something I learned
from the art of war.

1:00:13.242 --> 1:00:14.910
A book you never read
apparently.

1:00:14.943 --> 1:00:17.080
And unfortunately, you never
will.

1:00:18.213 --> 1:00:20.182
I guess it's only fair I tell
you that

1:00:20.215 --> 1:00:21.917
that little drink you was
sipping on

1:00:21.949 --> 1:00:24.586
was laced with a little poison.

1:00:24.619 --> 1:00:27.389
It's attacking your central
nervous system right now.

1:00:27.422 --> 1:00:31.326
What you're experiencing
is complete paralysis.

1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:33.695
In a minute, your heart's
gonna stop beating,

1:00:33.728 --> 1:00:36.164
your lungs will stop breathing,

1:00:36.197 --> 1:00:38.933
and your entire body will shut
down.

1:00:38.967 --> 1:00:40.903
It's not a pleasant way to die.

1:00:42.304 --> 1:00:43.304
Hm.

1:00:44.239 --> 1:00:46.309
You know what a blood sacrifice
is?

1:00:47.409 --> 1:00:51.079
Oh my bad, I forget you can't
speak.

1:00:52.447 --> 1:00:56.318
A blood sacrifice is an act of
loyalty,

1:00:56.985 --> 1:00:58.287
it's an act of courage,

1:01:00.255 --> 1:01:03.459
it's an act of commitment
to a brotherhood of men

1:01:03.492 --> 1:01:05.294
with unlimited power.

1:01:06.295 --> 1:01:09.298
You see red, there's a
whole governing force

1:01:09.331 --> 1:01:11.534
that controls the entire world,

1:01:11.567 --> 1:01:12.867
not just the record business,

1:01:12.900 --> 1:01:15.538
but the whole fucking world man.

1:01:15.570 --> 1:01:18.039
Some people call it new
world order, illuminati,

1:01:18.072 --> 1:01:23.978
catholic church, these
people influence nations.

1:01:24.012 --> 1:01:28.384
I'm beholden to a whole
separate omnipotent power,

1:01:28.416 --> 1:01:31.252
every so often I have to
make this blood sacrifice

1:01:31.286 --> 1:01:32.655
to prove my loyalty.

1:01:34.655 --> 1:01:38.661
You're not the first nor
will you be the last.

1:01:38.693 --> 1:01:41.264
Along with your wife and your
daughter.

1:01:42.498 --> 1:01:45.501
See, a dead rapper can be
manipulated,

1:01:45.534 --> 1:01:48.304
I can control his publishing,
his image.

1:01:50.005 --> 1:01:53.476
A dead rapper is worth
more than a live rapper.

1:01:54.009 --> 1:01:55.644
A dead manager,

1:01:56.945 --> 1:01:58.548
he worth nothing.

1:02:10.192 --> 1:02:13.496
Make the appropriate phone
calls, get rid of the body.

1:02:14.530 --> 1:02:16.966
Make sure you contact the
security firm

1:02:17.733 --> 1:02:19.268
get them to delete all footage

1:02:19.300 --> 1:02:21.503
of red waking into this
building.

1:02:25.206 --> 1:02:26.708
So long red.

1:02:45.159 --> 1:02:47.295
Yo, yo, yo, what's up?

1:02:47.329 --> 1:02:48.798
Everybody having a good time
tonight?

1:02:48.831 --> 1:02:51.500
Well right about now, we are
gonna bring the man in charge,

1:02:51.532 --> 1:02:53.802
he's gonna tell you all
what's going on tonight.

1:02:53.835 --> 1:02:58.006
Give it up for the head
of dark productions, Niko!

1:03:00.576 --> 1:03:02.878
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:03:02.911 --> 1:03:04.646

and giving you what you

1:03:11.686 --> 1:03:14.355
Matter fact, just to show our
commitment,

trusted, liquid, come on up
here man.

1:03:18.393 --> 1:03:20.295
Dark productions baby.

1:03:22.030 --> 1:03:23.932
And you do know that.

1:03:23.965 --> 1:03:26.032
Go and get your photo ops on.

1:03:28.202 --> 1:03:29.202
Yeah.

1:03:33.307 --> 1:03:34.777
Hello?

1:03:34.809 --> 1:03:35.911
Hey what's up?

1:03:35.943 --> 1:03:37.045
Why'd you leave?

1:03:40.449 --> 1:03:41.717
'Cause what?

1:03:42.751 --> 1:03:44.220
You used to like this stuff.

1:03:44.253 --> 1:03:45.888
I mean what's up?

1:03:48.956 --> 1:03:51.693
Man, that's all you wanna do
nowadays man,

1:03:51.726 --> 1:03:54.262
that's all you do nowadays is
spend money,

1:03:54.295 --> 1:03:55.763
and sniff stuff up your nose
man,

1:03:55.797 --> 1:03:56.565
I know you left with somebody.

1:03:56.597 --> 1:03:57.666
Who you leave with?

1:03:58.634 --> 1:03:59.977
You wanna tell me who you left
with?

1:04:00.001 --> 1:04:01.436
I know you left with somebody.

1:04:02.070 --> 1:04:03.439
You know what?

1:04:04.338 --> 1:04:05.607
I ain't even tripping.

1:04:10.778 --> 1:04:12.248
You know what?

1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:13.583
I'll talk to you later.

1:04:16.818 --> 1:04:18.721
Man, don't trip off that
bitch man,

1:04:18.753 --> 1:04:20.389
she jut showing you her true
colors man.

1:04:20.422 --> 1:04:22.625
I don't wanna hear all
that man, come on man.

1:04:24.259 --> 1:04:26.128
You got a lot to learn.

1:04:27.663 --> 1:04:30.199
Big meezy, let me get some
Tequila man.

1:04:36.804 --> 1:04:38.273
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

1:04:42.177 --> 1:04:43.178
What's up with it?

1:04:43.210 --> 1:04:44.479
Oh it's you.

1:04:44.512 --> 1:04:46.382
So how you liked the show?

1:04:47.615 --> 1:04:49.684
What show? That shit was
garbage.

1:04:51.385 --> 1:04:54.757
Look man I just figured since
we, you know,

1:04:54.789 --> 1:04:58.594
same label maybe we can holler.

1:04:58.626 --> 1:05:00.362
We ain't got nothing
to holler about homie.

1:05:00.394 --> 1:05:01.797
And you already know that.

1:05:02.331 --> 1:05:03.865
Fuck, I tried.

1:05:03.898 --> 1:05:06.534
Hey, let me get a double
shot of hennessy man.

1:05:09.137 --> 1:05:10.105

1:05:10.137 --> 1:05:11.539
I never did like you man.

1:05:11.572 --> 1:05:13.775
Or your punk ass brother.

1:05:13.809 --> 1:05:15.452
Especially when he was
begging for his life

1:05:15.476 --> 1:05:18.079
when we robbed his ass.

1:05:19.380 --> 1:05:20.750
Oh that was you?

1:05:23.318 --> 1:05:26.889
His face, man your brother

1:05:26.922 --> 1:05:30.726

1:05:34.362 --> 1:05:37.231
Let's get down to what this
shit is really about homie.

1:05:37.264 --> 1:05:39.701
What it's really about.

1:05:40.268 --> 1:05:41.869
About Britney.

1:05:41.902 --> 1:05:43.571
That's my woman.

1:05:43.605 --> 1:05:45.273
So stay the fuck away from her.

1:05:45.306 --> 1:05:46.074
Man you know what?

1:05:46.108 --> 1:05:47.576
Fuck you.

1:05:47.608 --> 1:05:49.510
Nah, really fuck you homie.

1:05:49.543 --> 1:05:50.778
Yeah.

1:05:50.811 --> 1:05:52.681
See I know what this shit
really about,

1:05:52.713 --> 1:05:55.583
about Britney and your feelings.

1:05:55.617 --> 1:05:59.989
How y'all felt about each
other, the baby that died.

1:06:00.889 --> 1:06:02.133
But I ain't got nothing to do
with that,

1:06:02.157 --> 1:06:05.494
it's a real touchy subject,
you know real real touchy.

1:06:06.628 --> 1:06:09.498
You know what? You a tough talking
nigga with a pistol on you.

1:06:10.065 --> 1:06:12.400
It ain't about no pistol guns.

1:06:12.434 --> 1:06:13.434
Nah.

1:06:14.135 --> 1:06:16.438
I'm from old school homie.

1:06:16.471 --> 1:06:18.282
I'll dust your mother
fucking ass off right now.

1:06:18.306 --> 1:06:21.643
Nigga, let's take it the
mother fucking alley then.

1:06:21.675 --> 1:06:23.846
Fuck all this talking nigga.

1:06:24.413 --> 1:06:25.947
Let's go.

This what you want right?

1:06:34.588 --> 1:06:35.556
There you go?

1:06:35.590 --> 1:06:36.658

1:06:47.369 --> 1:06:49.004
Hey, hey, hey!

1:06:49.036 --> 1:06:50.004
What's up?

1:06:50.038 --> 1:06:51.005
What's up homie?

1:06:51.039 --> 1:06:52.007
Yeah, I'll see you later.

1:06:52.039 --> 1:06:53.007
What's up homie?

1:06:53.041 --> 1:06:54.076
You know what's up nigga.

1:06:54.108 --> 1:06:54.809
You's a bitch.

1:06:54.842 --> 1:06:56.077
I'm a see you later nigga.

1:06:56.110 --> 1:06:57.179
You a bitch boy.

1:06:57.211 --> 1:06:58.746
You better watch your back
nigga.

1:06:58.780 --> 1:07:00.315
Let me get my heat.

1:07:00.347 --> 1:07:01.650
Yeah all right.

1:08:58.432 --> 1:08:59.432
Oh shit.

1:09:04.338 --> 1:09:06.274
That shit was fire man.

1:09:06.307 --> 1:09:07.943
Yeah that shit was lit.

1:09:37.605 --> 1:09:38.806
What's up?

1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:39.975
What you doing in here?

1:09:40.007 --> 1:09:42.478
It must be hard to lose
the women that you love.

1:09:43.310 --> 1:09:45.313
What the fuck you want?

1:09:46.014 --> 1:09:48.217
I thought you might
need somebody to talk to.

1:09:49.384 --> 1:09:51.453
Look, I don't fuck
with bitches like you,

1:09:51.485 --> 1:09:53.421
you already know that.

1:09:53.454 --> 1:09:56.291
Come on guns, you know
I'm your type of bitch.

1:09:56.323 --> 1:09:58.492
We want the same things in life.

1:09:58.525 --> 1:10:03.097
Money, power, and we're
willing to get it at any cost.

1:10:03.131 --> 1:10:04.365
You know we two of the same.

1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:07.735
Not even close.

1:10:09.037 --> 1:10:10.672
Deny it if you wish,

1:10:10.704 --> 1:10:12.116
but we'll both sell ourselves
to the devil

1:10:12.140 --> 1:10:13.542
to get what we want.

1:10:13.908 --> 1:10:15.344
Niko?

1:10:15.844 --> 1:10:17.212
Mr. Niko can give you things

1:10:17.244 --> 1:10:18.980
that are beyond your wildest
imagination.

1:10:19.514 --> 1:10:20.983
Hm, like you huh?

1:10:21.815 --> 1:10:23.484
If you wish,

1:10:23.518 --> 1:10:25.886
but first you have to pledge
your loyalty to Mr. Niko

1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:27.590
and then you can have
everything.

1:10:30.024 --> 1:10:31.359
There's only one problem,

1:10:31.393 --> 1:10:34.328
you know I don't like
trick ass bitches like you.

1:10:34.362 --> 1:10:36.632
Fuck you think you talking to?

1:10:36.664 --> 1:10:40.836
You ever come over here
again, I'll kill you.

1:10:42.369 --> 1:10:45.039
You think killing me is
gonna save your children?

1:10:45.073 --> 1:10:48.744
There's only one way,
come over to the dark side

1:10:48.777 --> 1:10:50.846
that way at least you'll have
a choice.

1:10:59.887 --> 1:11:02.557
Fuck you and the dark side.

1:11:44.164 --> 1:11:45.734
What happened to you?

1:11:47.502 --> 1:11:50.239
Question is, what happened
to us?

1:11:52.940 --> 1:11:56.411
Remember, you're the one that
introduced me to this shit.

1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:00.648
Do I satisfy you?

1:12:01.783 --> 1:12:03.185
Oh my god.

1:12:04.618 --> 1:12:05.688
You're okay.

1:12:06.354 --> 1:12:07.489
Okay?

1:12:12.260 --> 1:12:14.229
But women can do so much more.

1:12:14.261 --> 1:12:15.963
You know what I mean?

1:12:16.631 --> 1:12:23.472
You see Corey, women are much
more, uh,

1:12:23.505 --> 1:12:27.074
expressive with their
affections with each other.

1:12:27.108 --> 1:12:29.077
I used to be enough for you.

1:12:29.109 --> 1:12:30.278
Before all this.

1:12:31.112 --> 1:12:32.980
I know this is a lot
for you to get over,

1:12:33.014 --> 1:12:36.351
but you will be fine, okay?

1:12:45.859 --> 1:12:48.829
What you're gonna go see
liquid now?

1:12:48.863 --> 1:12:53.001
How sad, the big tough
rapper in the closet.

1:12:56.537 --> 1:12:58.105
Nicole.

1:12:58.139 --> 1:12:59.641
Nicole, get up baby!

1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:01.310
Nicole!

1:13:30.371 --> 1:13:31.407
Hello?

1:13:31.773 --> 1:13:34.342
I done something
bad Niko, really bad man.

1:13:34.375 --> 1:13:35.476
I need your help!

1:13:35.510 --> 1:13:36.590
What are you talking about?

1:13:37.110 --> 1:13:38.546
It's Nicole!

1:13:38.579 --> 1:13:40.314
I think I killed her man.

1:13:40.347 --> 1:13:41.882
She's dead man.

1:13:41.916 --> 1:13:43.652
What do you mean you
think you killed her?

1:13:43.685 --> 1:13:45.487
We got into an argument,

1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:47.889
I hit her, she fell and hit her
head man,

1:13:47.921 --> 1:13:49.957
she's bleeding, she not
moving man, she's dead.

1:13:50.692 --> 1:13:51.426
Where are you?

1:13:51.458 --> 1:13:53.260
I'm at her apartment man.

1:13:53.293 --> 1:13:54.595
I don't know what to do!

1:13:54.628 --> 1:13:56.331
All right listen, calm down,
calm down.

1:13:56.363 --> 1:13:58.567
I want you to calmly leave
the apartment,

1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:02.237
walk don't run, walk to
your car, get in your car,

1:14:02.270 --> 1:14:04.372
drive to the studio and meet me
there.

1:14:04.404 --> 1:14:05.940
Do you understand?

1:14:05.974 --> 1:14:08.543
Yeah, yeah go to the
studio and wait there.

1:14:08.576 --> 1:14:10.212
I understand.

1:14:10.244 --> 1:14:11.244
I understand.

1:14:29.963 --> 1:14:31.365
Is there a problem?

1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:34.469
Dumb ass Corey killed his
girlfriend.

1:14:34.502 --> 1:14:35.403
Nicole?

1:14:35.435 --> 1:14:36.438
Yeah.

1:14:36.470 --> 1:14:37.738
That's too bad.

1:14:37.771 --> 1:14:39.006
She was so sweet.

1:14:39.806 --> 1:14:40.975
Call the clean up crew,

1:14:41.009 --> 1:14:43.011
send them over to her apartment.

1:14:43.043 --> 1:14:44.778
It's time.

1:14:44.811 --> 1:14:46.481
It's time for the blood
sacrifice.

1:14:55.122 --> 1:14:56.757
Niko, what's happening bro?

1:14:56.791 --> 1:14:58.393
I need you to do something
for me.

1:14:59.327 --> 1:15:00.862
Man, I'll make it happen.

1:15:00.895 --> 1:15:02.130
What you need?

1:15:02.529 --> 1:15:05.067
It's time for your blood
sacrifice.

1:15:05.399 --> 1:15:06.399
Man.

1:15:07.801 --> 1:15:08.936
I could do it.

1:15:08.970 --> 1:15:11.273
I can't, I don't know, I can't
do it.

1:15:11.305 --> 1:15:12.373
What?

1:15:12.407 --> 1:15:14.042
Nigga I made you.

1:15:14.676 --> 1:15:17.812
I gave you everything you
desired, fame, fortune,

1:15:17.845 --> 1:15:20.715
all your little sexual
fantasies.

1:15:20.747 --> 1:15:24.318
In exchange you gave me an oath
a pledge.

1:15:25.052 --> 1:15:27.322
The consequences of you
breaking that oath

1:15:27.354 --> 1:15:29.557
are beyond your comprehension.

1:15:29.591 --> 1:15:31.493
You will experience hell on
earth,

1:15:31.525 --> 1:15:32.525
do you understand me?

1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:34.360
Yes.

1:15:35.662 --> 1:15:37.398
Now are you prepared to honor
your oath?

1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:40.435
Yeah, yeah.

1:15:40.902 --> 1:15:42.871
This is what you gotta do.

1:16:16.436 --> 1:16:17.439
Who is it?

1:16:17.471 --> 1:16:18.672
What's up? It's trusted homie.

1:16:18.706 --> 1:16:19.873

Yo, what's up nigga? Come on in.

1:16:21.775 --> 1:16:24.211

Hey whatever you do, don't have

1:16:30.752 --> 1:16:32.754
It's a pain in the ass.

1:16:32.787 --> 1:16:34.130
Hey, why you ain't been
answering my calls though?

1:16:34.154 --> 1:16:36.023

1:16:38.225 --> 1:16:40.027

1:16:41.496 --> 1:16:43.230

1:16:43.264 --> 1:16:44.899
Where it's at?

1:16:44.931 --> 1:16:46.600
Shit, I don't know.

1:16:46.634 --> 1:16:48.270
Back this shit up a minute ma.

1:16:49.069 --> 1:16:50.639

1:16:50.671 --> 1:16:52.439

1:16:52.472 --> 1:16:54.042

1:16:54.074 --> 1:16:56.177
That's about the size of it.

1:17:01.783 --> 1:17:03.652
I'm a little confused my nigga.

1:17:05.252 --> 1:17:07.154
First you say you got it,

1:17:07.188 --> 1:17:08.456

It's a shitty thing, I know.

1:17:12.926 --> 1:17:14.295
But it is what it is.

1:17:19.367 --> 1:17:20.835
Hey, hey, hold on, hold on.

1:17:20.868 --> 1:17:22.737

1:17:22.770 --> 1:17:23.505
Man, I didn't steal it!

1:17:23.537 --> 1:17:24.571
Well who got it?

1:17:24.604 --> 1:17:25.973
Niko took your shit.

1:17:26.006 --> 1:17:27.141
Niko?

1:17:27.175 --> 1:17:29.344

1:17:39.820 --> 1:17:42.623
He been telling Niko everything

1:17:42.657 --> 1:17:44.659
Fuck man.

1:17:44.692 --> 1:17:47.529
You can't make a move

1:17:49.329 --> 1:17:50.597
Man, I'm sorry bro.

1:17:50.631 --> 1:17:51.674
I'm sorry, you know that's

Hello?

Who is it?

1:18:26.533 --> 1:18:27.568
Britney, listen to me!

1:18:28.770 --> 1:18:30.939
Hello?

1:18:44.519 --> 1:18:45.787
What's up Britney?

1:18:46.621 --> 1:18:48.655
Liquid, what are you doing here?

1:18:48.689 --> 1:18:50.992
I just need to talk to you

1:18:51.024 --> 1:18:52.068
Can we talk some other time?

1:18:52.092 --> 1:18:54.561
Trusted is on his way over here.

1:18:54.595 --> 1:18:56.298
It's only gonna take
a minute though baby.

1:18:59.766 --> 1:19:01.403
All right, come in.

1:19:09.042 --> 1:19:10.644
What do you wanna talk about?

1:19:11.145 --> 1:19:15.884
You see, my brother,
that's my best friend.

1:19:15.917 --> 1:19:17.886
Actually, the only friend I
ever had.

1:19:17.918 --> 1:19:19.052
Ever since I was a kid,

1:19:19.086 --> 1:19:21.256
he's been the only one I could
depend on.

1:19:21.288 --> 1:19:22.323
Liquid.

1:19:22.789 --> 1:19:24.958
He just wouldn't listen.

1:19:24.992 --> 1:19:26.269
You know, my brother,
you know what I'm saying?

1:19:26.293 --> 1:19:27.729
He fall in and out of love

1:19:27.761 --> 1:19:30.297
and his emotions and
control take him everywhere.

1:19:30.331 --> 1:19:31.733
You know what I'm saying?

1:19:31.765 --> 1:19:33.442
He keep falling for different
girls time after time.

1:19:33.466 --> 1:19:34.644
Liquid, can you just listen
to me.

1:19:34.668 --> 1:19:37.471
No, listen to me, I told you
though.

1:19:37.505 --> 1:19:39.908
That you was not woman
enough for my brother.

1:19:39.940 --> 1:19:41.708
I just wanted you to leave him
alone.

1:19:41.742 --> 1:19:43.778
Your brother is a grown man,

1:19:43.810 --> 1:19:46.180
he can be with whoever it is
he wants to.

1:19:47.180 --> 1:19:49.616
Liquid, put the gun down.

1:19:49.649 --> 1:19:50.649
What are you doing?

1:19:51.918 --> 1:19:52.918

1:20:37.465 --> 1:20:39.634
Just go in the house, shut
the gate.

1:20:39.667 --> 1:20:41.369
You ain't my daddy.

1:20:56.516 --> 1:20:58.619

Did you know anything

1:22:29.010 --> 1:22:30.144

1:22:30.176 --> 1:22:32.246
Hey man, for once in
your measly ass life

1:22:32.279 --> 1:22:34.223
I want you to fucking look at
me and answer me like a man.

1:22:34.247 --> 1:22:35.482
I didn't know!

1:22:44.257 --> 1:22:45.793
You killed her huh?

1:22:46.527 --> 1:22:47.627
Why'd you kill her man?

1:22:47.661 --> 1:22:49.096
Man, I ain't killed nobody.

1:22:49.130 --> 1:22:49.896
You killed her!

1:22:49.930 --> 1:22:51.733
I didn't kill nobody!

1:22:51.765 --> 1:22:53.300
You couldn't accept the fact

1:22:53.333 --> 1:22:55.502
that she loved me more than
you man.

1:22:55.536 --> 1:22:56.304
Why you killed her man?

1:22:56.337 --> 1:22:57.505
What you trying to say?

1:22:57.537 --> 1:22:59.006
I'm a kill a woman over you
nigga?

1:22:59.039 --> 1:23:01.842
Is you out your crazy ass mind?

1:23:02.309 --> 1:23:03.309
Fuck no!

1:23:07.648 --> 1:23:09.250
I don't know what's going
on bro.

1:23:09.283 --> 1:23:10.318
What's going on?

1:23:11.152 --> 1:23:12.528
Oh, so now you got
your little ass brother

1:23:12.552 --> 1:23:14.221
doing your dirty work?

1:23:14.255 --> 1:23:15.288
My brother?

1:23:15.322 --> 1:23:16.391
What?

1:23:16.423 --> 1:23:18.393
Before I kill you myself.

1:23:18.426 --> 1:23:19.527
You killed her?

1:23:19.560 --> 1:23:20.871
He didn't even kill her
man, liquid killed her.

1:23:20.895 --> 1:23:21.662
What?

1:23:21.694 --> 1:23:22.697
You killed Britney?

1:23:22.729 --> 1:23:24.164
I didn't have no choice man!

1:23:24.198 --> 1:23:25.900
Because Niko set this whole
thing up!

1:23:25.932 --> 1:23:27.467
Man, don't listen to this
nigga man.

1:23:27.501 --> 1:23:28.577
We was supposed to kill
each other.

1:23:28.601 --> 1:23:29.601
Shut up!

1:23:40.346 --> 1:23:41.524
That was a hell of a
performance,

1:23:41.548 --> 1:23:43.751
I don't think I've seen
anything like it.

1:23:43.783 --> 1:23:45.085
You thought this was amusing?

1:23:46.052 --> 1:23:49.590
On the contrary, I thought
it was well executed.

1:23:50.890 --> 1:23:54.161
You see Corey, there comes
a time in a man's life

1:23:54.194 --> 1:23:56.197
when he's gotta make certain
decisions,

1:23:56.229 --> 1:24:00.567
certain business decisions
that aren't always appreciated.

1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:05.839
You see, one dead rapper could
create an icon, a legend.

1:24:05.872 --> 1:24:08.009
But three dead rappers.

1:24:10.277 --> 1:24:12.046
That's an international event

1:24:12.078 --> 1:24:14.215
that could be talked about
for decades.

1:24:15.115 --> 1:24:18.752
Three dead rappers, is better
than one.

1:24:18.786 --> 1:24:20.121
Hell four is even better.

1:24:21.421 --> 1:24:24.259
But you need somebody
alive to tell the story.

1:24:25.626 --> 1:24:27.162
Keep the legend going.

1:24:28.261 --> 1:24:29.261
What's it gone be Corey?

1:24:31.431 --> 1:24:34.234
You gone stay alive and
tell the story,

1:24:36.936 --> 1:24:39.274
or you gonna join your
friends in the mortality?

1:24:43.911 --> 1:24:45.145
I can't hear you.

1:24:47.780 --> 1:24:49.283
Tell the story.

1:24:50.150 --> 1:24:51.752
That's a good choice.

1:24:54.755 --> 1:24:56.858
Look, I'm sorry about your
brother.

1:24:57.658 --> 1:24:59.461
But a sacrifice had to be made.

1:25:02.863 --> 1:25:04.766
Consider yourself lucky.

1:25:05.166 --> 1:25:07.469
Hm, one more thing.

1:25:08.469 --> 1:25:10.270
It don't look right for the
lone survivor

1:25:10.304 --> 1:25:11.840
to come out unmarked.

1:25:13.606 --> 1:25:14.606
Fuck!

1:25:19.279 --> 1:25:21.181
I trust we'll have
your full cooperation?

1:25:21.948 --> 1:25:23.283
Yeah.

1:25:23.850 --> 1:25:25.819
So what do I do now?

1:25:25.853 --> 1:25:27.355
Tell a story nigga.

1:25:28.189 --> 1:25:29.891
Any story you like.

1:25:33.894 --> 1:25:35.195
So we're right back

1:25:35.229 --> 1:25:37.365
with the final segment of
our interview with Corey.

1:25:37.398 --> 1:25:41.269
So Corey, we've all heard
the story over and over,

1:25:41.301 --> 1:25:42.936
you are the sole survivor

1:25:42.970 --> 1:25:45.706
of the worst massacre in
rap history.

1:25:45.738 --> 1:25:47.140
We lost three of the biggest
names

1:25:47.173 --> 1:25:48.509
in the hip hop community.

1:25:48.542 --> 1:25:51.979
Your brother, guns, may he
rest in peace

1:25:52.011 --> 1:25:54.782
and the dynamic duo of trusted
and liquid.

1:25:54.814 --> 1:25:57.451
What do you have to say
about this tragic event?

1:25:57.484 --> 1:25:58.986
Well I just wanna thank god

1:25:59.019 --> 1:26:00.855
for allowing me to be here.

1:26:00.887 --> 1:26:02.122
My brother saved my life,

1:26:02.155 --> 1:26:04.225
and I'll always be thankful
for that.

1:26:04.257 --> 1:26:05.158
You know, as you go
through life,

1:26:05.192 --> 1:26:06.027
you learn what's important.

1:26:06.060 --> 1:26:08.462
What's real and what's not.

1:26:08.494 --> 1:26:10.230
You become well appreciative
of life

1:26:10.264 --> 1:26:12.500
and those around you that you
truly love.

1:26:12.533 --> 1:26:13.868
I'm just happy to be here

1:26:13.900 --> 1:26:15.745
and to keep making these hits
for all the fans out there.

1:26:15.769 --> 1:26:17.471
We do this for the fans.

1:26:17.503 --> 1:26:19.739
So I just wanna tell
everyone to keep living,

1:26:19.773 --> 1:26:22.409
stay true to yourself
and keep faith in god.

1:26:22.443 --> 1:26:23.443
Corey out.
