Neighbors.

38:23.779 --> 38:26.260
Thank you.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.568
Hey, I think you know
my patient in four.

38:29.611 --> 38:30.743
I do?

38:30.786 --> 38:31.874
You went
to high school with him.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.093
Dorian Harwell.

38:33.136 --> 38:35.095
Oh, my God.
Dorian Harwell.

38:35.138 --> 38:38.403
I haven't seen him in 25 years.

38:38.446 --> 38:39.447
Is he all right?

38:39.491 --> 38:40.535
He had
a grade 1 glioma.

38:40.579 --> 38:41.754
Waiting on
a neurosurgeon consult,

38:41.797 --> 38:43.277
but his prognosis is good.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.931
- Is he okay to see visitors?
- Uh-huh.

38:44.974 --> 38:46.019
- Okay.
- Maggie.

38:46.062 --> 38:47.368
- Yeah?
- Um...

38:50.806 --> 38:52.330
Is he my father?

38:52.373 --> 38:54.593
Oh, sweetie, no.

38:54.636 --> 38:56.290
Okay.

38:58.248 --> 39:01.426
But if he isn't, then who is?

39:01.469 --> 39:03.166
You've never asked me
that before.

39:03.210 --> 39:04.472
I know.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.909
But just meeting Dorian,
it just made me think.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.783
I'm sorry, Vanessa.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.175
But I can't tell you.

39:12.219 --> 39:14.787
Your biological father
and I agreed

39:14.830 --> 39:16.963
that we would never
contact you.

39:17.006 --> 39:18.704
I broke that agreement,

39:18.747 --> 39:23.317
but I can't make
that choice for him.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.840
But maybe you could
just reach out and ask him

39:24.884 --> 39:25.885
if he'd like to meet me.

39:25.928 --> 39:28.627
Vanessa.

39:28.670 --> 39:29.628
We didn't stay in touch.

39:29.671 --> 39:33.283
I don't even know where he is.

39:33.327 --> 39:34.676
Okay.

I guess I really upended
Miles' and Anya's lives.

39:59.179 --> 40:01.181
Look, at least
Anya got to hear

40:01.224 --> 40:05.272
Miles' reasons for withholding
the truth from her.

40:05.315 --> 40:07.927
I wouldn't be at all surprised
if he actually convinced her

40:07.970 --> 40:09.581
to take that job.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.191
Seriously.

40:11.234 --> 40:13.367
But look, whatever happens,
at least now,

40:13.411 --> 40:15.674
they need to figure out

40:15.717 --> 40:16.675

I never got to have

Let's say you did.

What do you think
his reasons might have been

40:39.524 --> 40:41.047
for withholding

40:41.090 --> 40:43.528
his relationship with Gerald
from you?

40:48.141 --> 40:54.103
Maybe the same as what
Miles wanted for his daughter.
