01:08.083 --> 01:10.083
This chew toy's
all chewed out.

01:10.083 --> 01:12.416
-Another one?
-It's a chewy kind of day.

01:12.416 --> 01:15.708
Sunday,
Monday, Chewsday.

01:15.708 --> 01:18.833
(howls, laughs)

01:20.833 --> 01:23.625
Then it's a good thing
we have plenty
of other chew toys.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.875
(squeaks)

01:26.250 --> 01:28.208
I chewed
all those too.

01:28.208 --> 01:31.500
Whoa! You weren't kidding
about the chewy
kind of day thing.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.958
When it comes
to chewing, I never kid.

01:33.958 --> 01:36.166
Every day is
Chewsday to me.

01:36.166 --> 01:39.000
Ooh! Dog bone!
Nom, nom, nom.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.083
Pace yourself.
That's the last
chew toy we've got.

01:42.083 --> 01:43.583
(Bob laughs)
Look, guys!

01:43.583 --> 01:47.416
My sister Bonnie just sent me
a brand-new boomerang

01:47.416 --> 01:49.208
all the way from Australia.

01:49.208 --> 01:51.875
-I can't wait
to show you how it works.
-(beeping)

01:51.875 --> 01:54.291
(gasps)
Oh! It's time for work!

01:54.291 --> 01:57.458
See you in a while,
puppy-diles!

01:57.458 --> 01:59.375
A boomerang
from Bonnie?

01:59.375 --> 02:02.375
-Did you hear that, Rolly?
-Hear what? (grunts)

02:03.833 --> 02:06.000
(gasps) Whoa!

02:06.000 --> 02:09.375
(didgeridoo plays)

02:09.375 --> 02:12.458
If there's one thing
I love more than a chewy toy,

02:12.458 --> 02:13.583
it's a chewy stick!

02:13.583 --> 02:15.166
Wait, Rolly!
That's not a...

02:15.166 --> 02:16.291
-(growls)
-(boomerang snaps)

02:16.291 --> 02:18.000
...a stick.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
It's Bob's
special boomerang
from Bonnie.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.250
Bob's booma-what?

02:22.250 --> 02:23.833
A Boomerang!

02:23.833 --> 02:26.958
Sometimes it is used
in special ceremonies
or recreation.

02:26.958 --> 02:30.000
A boomerang
is a curved, flat
piece of wood

02:30.000 --> 02:33.458
that can be thrown
and is supposed to come
back to the thrower.

02:33.458 --> 02:35.875
A stick that comes back
to you when you throw it?

02:35.875 --> 02:36.958
I want one!

02:38.125 --> 02:39.500
Oh, I guess
we had one.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.458
Bob wanted
to play with this,

02:41.458 --> 02:43.708
but now it's broken.
All because of me.

02:43.708 --> 02:45.833
We can find him
another one just like it,

02:45.833 --> 02:48.416
and I have an idea of where
we can start looking.

02:48.416 --> 02:50.500
Come on, Rolly,
we've got a mission:

02:50.500 --> 02:52.708
Find a new boomerang
for Bob!

02:52.708 --> 02:54.500
We're gonna need
these pieces,

02:54.500 --> 02:56.375
so we can find one
just like it.

03:00.416 --> 03:01.416
Bulworth:
But...

03:03.458 --> 03:06.458
Sadly, I don't have
any boomerangs here
at the junkyard.

03:06.458 --> 03:08.875
No boomerangs?
Boomer-bummer.

03:08.875 --> 03:10.000
(clang)

03:10.000 --> 03:11.333
My cousin
might have some.

03:11.333 --> 03:15.416
He lives in a store
in Australia that collects
all sorts of things.

03:15.416 --> 03:18.625
Australia! Bonnie sent
the boomerang from there!

03:18.625 --> 03:21.000
Yeah! So let's go there
to get a new one!

03:21.000 --> 03:24.250
My cousin is
in a part of Australia
called the Outback.

03:24.250 --> 03:25.291
Thanks, Bulworth!

03:25.291 --> 03:26.375
Come on, Rolly!

03:26.375 --> 03:27.708
We're going
to Australia!

03:27.708 --> 03:29.333
Good luck, pups!

03:29.333 --> 03:31.333
(jet zooms)

03:32.833 --> 03:35.458
Rolly:
Wow! Australia is big.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.583
I wonder how
we're gonna find
Bulworth's cousin.

03:37.583 --> 03:39.416
Bulworth said he lived
in the Outback.

03:39.416 --> 03:41.583
We need to find a way
to get there first.

03:41.583 --> 03:45.833
Look, Frank!
There's the tour bus
we're supposed to take!

03:45.833 --> 03:49.166
It's gonna be a long ride
to the Outback.

03:49.166 --> 03:52.125
The Outback!
That's where
we need to go!

03:52.125 --> 03:53.875
It says here, Frank,
that there are

03:53.875 --> 03:57.500
all sorts of animals
in the Australian Outback,

03:57.500 --> 04:01.375
like wedge-tailed eagles
and even kangaroos!

04:01.375 --> 04:03.333
So many fun things
to see in Australia.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.333
(tires screech)

04:08.708 --> 04:10.750
-(brakes squeak)
-(tires screech)

04:10.750 --> 04:12.958
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to one

04:12.958 --> 04:15.458
of the most famous sites
in the Australian Outback,

04:15.458 --> 04:18.250
Uluru,
also known as Ayers Rock.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.291
(gasps)
Ooh! Let's go take
some pictures, Frank!

04:21.291 --> 04:26.416
I want to get every angle
of this majestic sandstone
rock formation!

04:26.416 --> 04:28.458
You had me at "sandstone."

04:28.458 --> 04:29.708
We're in the Outback!

04:29.708 --> 04:32.000
And now we just have
to find Bulworth's cousin.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.416
Let's look around!

We've wandered pretty far,
and still no shop,
and no boomerang.

05:29.458 --> 05:32.166
Yeah, we should probably
get back to the bus.

05:32.166 --> 05:35.458
And there it is!
I really thought we
wandered farther than this.

05:38.291 --> 05:40.333
This is definitely
not our bus.

05:40.333 --> 05:43.291
But look at all those chewy-
looking sticks over there.

05:43.291 --> 05:45.416
Rolly! We just found
boomerangs!

05:47.416 --> 05:50.583
I wonder if this is where
Bulworth's cousin lives.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.291
(laughs)
Did you say, "Bulworth"?

05:53.291 --> 05:54.458
He's me cousin.

05:54.458 --> 05:55.500
You really called that.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.625
G'day.
I'm Outback Jack.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.500
G'day, Outback Jack!

05:59.500 --> 06:01.708
I'm Bingo and this is
my brother, Rolly.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.458
We're here to find
a new boomerang

06:03.458 --> 06:04.750
for our owner, Bob.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.708
Ooh, very nice design.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.583
Well, you came
to the right place.

06:08.583 --> 06:09.958
This is a collector's shop,

06:09.958 --> 06:12.500
and we've built quite
the collection over the years.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.083
Any mate of Bulworth's
is a mate of mine,

06:15.083 --> 06:17.708
so if you find the one
you want, you can keep it.

06:17.708 --> 06:21.500
Thanks, but all those
boomerangs are gonna
take forever to look through.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.458
Then we'd better
start searching.

06:23.458 --> 06:24.625
I'll give you a paw.

06:26.875 --> 06:30.458
That one didn't look
like Bob's boomerang.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.583
(whooshing)

06:34.166 --> 06:36.583
None of the designs
on these ones match!

06:36.583 --> 06:38.500
Not this one, either!

06:45.458 --> 06:46.500
(whimpers)

06:46.500 --> 06:47.750
We've been through
every boomerang

06:47.750 --> 06:49.500
and none of 'em
look like Bob's.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.583
Australia is big,
so we just have
to search somewhere else.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.708
I'm sure we'll find
the right one soon.

06:54.708 --> 06:56.583
What kind of puppy
would make Bob sad

06:56.583 --> 06:57.875
by breaking his boomerang?

06:57.875 --> 06:59.750
-(clatters)
-(Bingo gasps)

06:59.750 --> 07:02.583
The kind of puppy who finds
a new boomerang for Bob!

07:02.583 --> 07:05.458
-Look!
-(gasps) It looks
just like Bob's!

07:06.708 --> 07:08.708
Let's make sure it's
in good working order

07:08.708 --> 07:10.875
and see if it comes back
when you throw it.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.333
-(grunts)
-(whooshing)

07:12.333 --> 07:13.583
(Bingo and Rolly laugh)

07:17.708 --> 07:19.750
(wind blowing)

07:19.750 --> 07:22.333
If boomerangs
always come back,

07:22.333 --> 07:24.208
how come this one's
taking so long?

07:24.208 --> 07:26.333
Something must be wrong.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.583
Aw, man!

07:27.583 --> 07:29.708
Did we break
another boomerang?

07:29.708 --> 07:31.208
-Let's go find it!
-Righty-o!

07:31.208 --> 07:33.458
And I'll stay here in case
it does come back.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.875
(sniffing)

07:40.500 --> 07:42.375
Where in the world
could it have gone?

07:42.375 --> 07:43.833
(female laughs)

07:43.833 --> 07:45.083
There!

07:46.125 --> 07:47.708
Why isn't it going
back to the shop?

07:47.708 --> 07:49.500
-Weird.
-Yeah.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.083
-Weird.
-Let's see where it's going.

07:54.583 --> 07:57.708
(laughs)
This boomerang is a beauty!

07:57.708 --> 07:59.583
It goes so high!

07:59.583 --> 08:01.875
(laughs)
Take a gander at this!

08:03.708 --> 08:06.291
Mmm. You should see
if it belongs to someone.

08:06.291 --> 08:08.583
It might be lost,
and I'll bet they miss it.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.708
We found it flying
through the air!

08:10.708 --> 08:12.333
I think it's a wild one!

08:12.333 --> 08:14.166
That's actually
our boomerang.

08:14.166 --> 08:17.291
Crikey!
You blokes startled me!

08:17.291 --> 08:19.458
Wow! Nice throw!

08:19.458 --> 08:22.250
Told you, Boomer.
It was someone else's.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.708
Sorry we took your boomerang.
We'll give it back to you...

08:24.708 --> 08:26.750
As soon as it comes
back to me.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.458
I threw it pretty hard.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.625
I'm Rang, and this is
me sister, Boomer.

08:30.625 --> 08:31.875
Nice to meet you, puppies.

08:31.875 --> 08:33.708
Nice to meet you... uh...

08:34.708 --> 08:36.750
-What are they?
-Kangaroos!

08:36.750 --> 08:39.500
Can't you tell
by the way we like
to hop, hop hop?

08:39.500 --> 08:41.708
I can now.
Those are some good hops.

08:41.708 --> 08:43.625
Kangaroos have strong legs

08:43.625 --> 08:45.833
for hopping and going fast!

08:45.833 --> 08:47.750
The boomerang!
It's coming back!

08:47.750 --> 08:50.000
(eagle screeches)

08:50.000 --> 08:51.708
What are the chances?

08:51.708 --> 08:53.708
We need to catch up
with that eagle,

08:53.708 --> 08:56.625
but we can't fly
or even run that fast.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.583
Think outside
the box, mate!

08:58.583 --> 09:02.458
We can't run or fly,
but we sure can hop... fast!

09:02.458 --> 09:03.875
So, hop in!

09:05.750 --> 09:07.166
You comfy in there?

09:07.166 --> 09:09.708
Comfy as a puppy
in a kangaroo pouch!

09:09.708 --> 09:12.208
Hang on!
It's gonna get bumpy!

09:12.208 --> 09:13.750
After that eagle!

09:16.125 --> 09:19.750
-I love Australia!
-Me too!

09:26.875 --> 09:29.875
The eagle thinks the boomerang
is a stick for its nest.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.958
Ugh! But it's not a stick.
It's Bob's boomerang.

09:32.958 --> 09:36.250
No worries!
We'll give you
a leg up or two.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.750
Both:
Hop on our feet!

09:37.750 --> 09:41.208
We can bounce you higher
than you've ever bounced before!

09:41.208 --> 09:44.458
-You coming, Rolly?
-We could use our collars,

09:44.458 --> 09:46.083
but this is way more fun.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.875
Hop, hop, and away!

09:48.875 --> 09:51.625
-(Bingo laughs)
-Rolly: Awesome!

09:51.625 --> 09:54.458
-Aren't Boomer
and Rang nice?
-So nice.

09:54.458 --> 09:55.875
Whoa!

09:55.875 --> 09:58.000
-Whoa!
-(both grunt)

10:00.125 --> 10:01.750
This is
a really cool nest.

10:01.750 --> 10:05.375
So many sticks!
It's like we're in stick heaven!

10:05.375 --> 10:07.166
Oh, I just wanna
chew 'em all!

10:07.166 --> 10:08.958
We need to stay focused
on the mission, Rolly.

10:08.958 --> 10:11.708
Right.
Find Bob's boomerang.

10:11.708 --> 10:13.708
I know, I know.

10:13.708 --> 10:16.583
-See it anywhere?
-It should be here somewhere.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.583
Being in this nest
with all these sticks

10:18.583 --> 10:21.291
makes me want
to chew something so bad.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.708
Oh! Look at
that chewy stick!

10:23.708 --> 10:27.375
(gasps) That chewy stick
is a boomerang!

10:29.416 --> 10:31.875
Don't chew it, Rolly.
Don't chew it.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.875
There! Got it,
and I didn't chew
it this time.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.625
High paw!

10:38.625 --> 10:41.000
Now we just need
to get down,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.500
and I know just how
we're going to do it.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.833
These parachutes
Bob put in our collars

10:47.833 --> 10:49.833
-sure came in handy.
-Very convenient.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.000
(grunts)

10:52.000 --> 10:53.833
We got Bob's boomerang.

10:53.833 --> 10:54.875
Thanks for your help,
kangaroos!

10:54.875 --> 10:56.875
Now that you've got
that boomerang,

10:56.875 --> 10:59.291
we kangaroos need to find
another one to play with.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.875
I got tons you can have.

11:00.875 --> 11:03.375
You didn't come back,
so I thought I'd
check in on you.

11:03.375 --> 11:06.000
Hey! You got
the boomerang back!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.208
We couldn't have done it
without our new friends.

11:08.208 --> 11:11.875
No worries. We're more
than happy to help
our new puppy mates.

11:11.875 --> 11:14.833
You need help,
we hop to it, huh?

11:14.833 --> 11:15.875
(both shout)

11:17.125 --> 11:18.291
We'd better head back home

11:18.291 --> 11:19.875
so we can give Bob
his boomerang.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.958
Cheerio!
We'll miss you pups.

11:21.958 --> 11:23.166
Goodbye, young ones.

11:23.166 --> 11:26.375
-Don't be a stranger!
-Bingo: Yeah! See ya!

11:27.833 --> 11:30.083
-Hey, fellas, I'm home.
-(barking)

11:30.083 --> 11:32.875
Bob, I accidentally
chewed up your boomerang.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.458
But we got you
a new one!

11:34.458 --> 11:37.250
-(barking)
-Well, you both seem
especially excited today.

11:37.250 --> 11:40.875
Oh! Oh no!
My new boomerang
got chewed up!

11:40.875 --> 11:43.166
But hey,
Bonnie sent me
an extra one!

11:43.166 --> 11:45.958
Phew!
Oh, and that reminds me.

11:45.958 --> 11:50.875
I noticed you guys
were out of chew toys,
so I got you guys these!

11:50.875 --> 11:54.375
(laughs)
I made sure to get some
with super strong rubber.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.833
-Even a big dog
couldn't chew up...
-(squeaking)

11:59.958 --> 12:02.458
You never cease
to amaze me, Rolly.

12:02.458 --> 12:03.875
Me neither.

12:03.875 --> 12:07.000
Bob:
Well, it's a good thing
I got an extra one too,

12:07.000 --> 12:08.875
but this time
you'll have to catch it

12:08.875 --> 12:10.125
before you chew it.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.750
Let's go outside,
and then we'll see

12:12.750 --> 12:15.458
how far this new
boomerang can fly!

12:15.458 --> 12:17.416
(puppies laugh)

12:17.416 --> 12:19.208
(whooshing)

12:22.958 --> 12:24.833
(Rolly speaks)

12:24.833 --> 12:27.000
I'm ready
to fetch, Rolly!

12:29.375 --> 12:31.875
(whirs, stops)

12:31.875 --> 12:34.708
Um, the fetch machine
isn't working, Bingo.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.625
Maybe it needs
a little Rolly power.

12:36.625 --> 12:37.958
-(bangs)
-(whirring)

12:38.958 --> 12:40.583
Bow-whoa!

12:40.583 --> 12:42.291
-(squeaking)
-(panting)

12:42.291 --> 12:46.125
-(grunts)
-That was awesome!

12:46.125 --> 12:49.083
Bingo, Rolly,
come inside!

12:49.083 --> 12:50.833
I have a surprise for you!

12:50.833 --> 12:53.125
A surprise?
How surprising!

12:53.125 --> 12:54.166
(both laugh)

12:54.166 --> 12:57.125
-(barking)
-Bob: Whoa there, fellas!

12:57.125 --> 12:59.125
Ready for the surprise?

12:59.125 --> 13:00.708
I was born ready!

13:00.708 --> 13:03.125
I was born a puppy,
but I'm also ready.

13:03.125 --> 13:06.000
I want to introduce you
to the newest addition

13:06.000 --> 13:08.166
to our family!
Olivia.

13:08.166 --> 13:10.333
(gurgling)

13:10.333 --> 13:14.708
Um, Rolly, I don't see
anything in there, do you?

13:14.708 --> 13:17.708
Umm, maybe the fishbowl's
name is Olivia?

13:17.708 --> 13:19.958
Whoa. Great-- great gears!
Where'd she...

13:19.958 --> 13:23.000
Oh! (chuckles)
There you are,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.166
hiding behind
that purple plant.

13:25.166 --> 13:28.291
Is it me, or is she just
the cutest fish ever?

13:28.291 --> 13:30.125
Ever! Hi, Olivia!

13:30.125 --> 13:32.000
(bubbles)

13:32.000 --> 13:35.875
ARF is super duper excited
to have a new family member!

13:35.875 --> 13:38.208
And I'm excited
to have a sister!

13:38.208 --> 13:40.875
Hi there!
You're so cute and quiet,

13:40.875 --> 13:43.500
and we're going to be
the best nap buddies ever.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.125
I never thought I'd say this,

13:45.125 --> 13:47.125
but I'm too excited
to nap right now.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.708
(bubbling)

13:48.708 --> 13:51.958
Now, while I'm at work,
I hope you can make Olivia
feel at home.

13:51.958 --> 13:54.000
Have a great day!

13:54.000 --> 13:55.833
-Now we have two sisters!
-(door opens)

13:55.833 --> 13:58.000
This is double
bow-wow-wowie!

13:59.000 --> 14:00.750
Welcome to your new home!

14:00.750 --> 14:03.125
(bubbling)

14:03.125 --> 14:05.000
I'm Bingo,
and this is Rolly.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.875
-We're your new brothers.
-And ARF too!

14:07.875 --> 14:10.000
You're gonna love
your new home, Olivia!

14:10.000 --> 14:11.875
There's so many
fun things to do!

14:11.875 --> 14:15.208
Dig holes in the backyard,
chew on chew toys,

14:15.208 --> 14:16.333
collect sticks.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.875
Those are things
that puppies like to do.

14:18.875 --> 14:21.000
Fish can't dig holes
in the backyard

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
or chew on toys,
or collect sticks.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.583
Right. On account of her
being in a fish bowl

14:26.583 --> 14:27.875
and being a fish.

14:27.875 --> 14:30.583
So, what do you
like to do, Olivia?

14:30.583 --> 14:32.166
(bubbling)

14:32.166 --> 14:34.750
Rolly:
Well, she likes to swim
around that purple plant.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.083
Well, we can't swim with her
in that fish bowl.

14:37.083 --> 14:39.000
It's too small.
Let's go outside and see

14:39.000 --> 14:40.750
if there's something
we can play together.

14:40.750 --> 14:43.125
(bubbling)

14:43.125 --> 14:45.000
Fetch is one
of my favorite games.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.416
I think
you'll really like it.

14:46.416 --> 14:48.125
Watch how it's done, Olivia.

14:49.125 --> 14:52.291
I don't think Olivia
can play fetch, because...

14:52.291 --> 14:54.708
-(bangs)
-(whirring)

14:56.250 --> 14:57.291
(gasps)

14:57.291 --> 14:59.958
-Bingo: Olivia!
-All: No!

14:59.958 --> 15:01.000
I got her!

15:03.416 --> 15:05.166
(truck engine chugging)

15:07.875 --> 15:09.458
We just lost our sister!

15:09.458 --> 15:10.833
You're right, Hissy!

15:10.833 --> 15:12.583
Fetch is not
a game for a fish.

15:12.583 --> 15:15.583
But we need
to get her back!
She's family!

15:15.583 --> 15:18.958
And Bob will be so sad
if he comes home
and she's gone.

15:18.958 --> 15:20.416
Bob is not gonna be sad,

15:20.416 --> 15:23.125
because our mission is
to bring our sister home.

15:23.125 --> 15:25.416
-Come on, Rolly.
-I'm coming with you!

15:25.416 --> 15:27.708
-She's my sister too!
-Let's go!

15:27.708 --> 15:29.166
-♪ Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba ♪
-(laughing)

15:29.166 --> 15:32.458
-Whoa!
-♪ We're goin' on a mission,
goin' on a mission ♪

15:32.458 --> 15:35.000
-♪ Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba ♪
-(laughing)

15:35.000 --> 15:36.291
♪ We're goin' on a mission ♪

15:38.166 --> 15:40.958
I miss Olivia's cute
fishy face already!

15:40.958 --> 15:42.250
What do we do now, Bingo?

15:42.250 --> 15:43.416
Poor Olivia!

15:43.416 --> 15:46.166
How do you find a fish
in the middle of the city?

15:46.166 --> 15:48.125
Of course!
She's a fish!

15:48.125 --> 15:50.083
-So?
-(sniffs)

15:50.083 --> 15:53.458
To find her, we just gotta
follow the scent of...

15:53.458 --> 15:55.833
Fish! Because Olivia's
a fish!

15:55.833 --> 15:57.250
Great idea, Bingo!

15:57.250 --> 16:00.125
(sniffing)

16:02.583 --> 16:04.375
(giggles)

16:04.375 --> 16:06.250
Oh! Oh! I think I...

16:06.250 --> 16:08.458
(sniffs)
Yup! I got the scent.

16:08.458 --> 16:11.291
Bingo, Hissy, follow me
and my puppy nose.

16:11.291 --> 16:14.166
Don't worry,
Olivia, your brothers
and sister are coming.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.958
(bell dinging)

16:17.958 --> 16:19.625
(sniffing)

16:23.125 --> 16:25.291
(bubbling)

16:25.291 --> 16:26.208
Oops, wrong fish.

16:26.208 --> 16:29.000
(grunts, sniffing)

16:29.000 --> 16:30.958
Okay, I got
the scent again.

16:37.208 --> 16:39.125
Whoa! Whaley?

16:39.125 --> 16:42.458
-Wrong fish again.
-Technically, I'm a mammal.

16:42.458 --> 16:44.166
(sniffing)

16:44.166 --> 16:46.125
I got the scent again.
Bye, Whaley!

16:50.416 --> 16:52.708
Oh man!
Where'd the scent go!

16:54.250 --> 16:56.875
Nope. I think
I lost it
for good.

16:56.875 --> 16:59.458
-We'll never find her now.
-It's okay, Rolly.

16:59.458 --> 17:01.083
-(truck approaches)
-That's the truck!

17:02.375 --> 17:03.875
Bingo:
And that's Olivia!

17:07.708 --> 17:08.958
We're gaining on it!

17:08.958 --> 17:10.125
Hold on, Olivia!

17:12.875 --> 17:14.166
(trio gasps)

17:20.875 --> 17:22.291
There she is!

17:22.291 --> 17:24.125
She's pretty good
on that skateboard.

17:24.125 --> 17:27.458
Bingo: And fast!
We're gonna need extra speed!

17:27.458 --> 17:30.000
Come on, Hissy,
let's ride!

17:30.000 --> 17:31.708
(collars beep)

17:31.708 --> 17:33.583
(rock music plays)

17:35.125 --> 17:37.250
-Whoa-ho-ho!
-Whoo-hoo!

17:37.250 --> 17:39.000
-Whoa!
-There she is!

17:39.000 --> 17:41.166
We're coming, Olivia!

17:42.291 --> 17:44.375
Yippie!
(laughing)

17:46.000 --> 17:48.208
-Oh! A fish!
-Chase the fish!

17:48.208 --> 17:50.500
That fish is fast!

17:50.500 --> 17:53.208
Those dogs wanna catch
Olivia before we do.

17:53.208 --> 17:55.958
We gotta do something!
Hang on, Olivia!

17:55.958 --> 17:58.125
If there's one thing
that dogs like to chase

17:58.125 --> 17:59.875
more than fish
on skateboards,

17:59.875 --> 18:01.708
-it's cats.
-Bingo and Rolly:
Thanks, Hissy!

18:01.708 --> 18:02.708
(meows loudly)

18:04.333 --> 18:06.375
-Dogs: Huh?
-Don't worry about me.

18:06.375 --> 18:07.583
Go save our sister!

18:07.583 --> 18:11.583
A cat! Ooh!
Let's chase her instead!

18:11.583 --> 18:14.000
Bet you can't
catch me, doggies!

18:14.000 --> 18:15.416
(both barking)

18:15.416 --> 18:18.625
Come on, Rolly.
We gotta fetch
that fish!

Bingo:
Almost there.

19:08.125 --> 19:09.875
We got you, Olivia!

19:09.875 --> 19:12.875
Your puppy brothers
will stop at nothing
to make sure you're okay.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.208
You are okay, right?

19:14.208 --> 19:15.458
(bubbling)

19:15.458 --> 19:17.458
I think that's
a fishy thumbs up.

19:17.458 --> 19:20.333
Huh! Those dogs
never had a chance.

19:20.333 --> 19:23.875
(gasps) Olivia! I was
so worried about you!

19:23.875 --> 19:26.458
That was an amazing save.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.291
We couldn't have done it
without you, Hissy.

19:28.291 --> 19:29.875
You know what that calls for!

19:29.875 --> 19:31.416
A family high paw!

19:32.458 --> 19:33.875
High paw, Hissy!

19:35.875 --> 19:37.291
High Paw, Olivia!

19:39.375 --> 19:41.500
Well, now that we've got Olivia,

19:41.500 --> 19:43.333
we just need to take her
back home and, um...

19:43.333 --> 19:45.875
-Oh no! Olivia!
-Olivia!

19:48.375 --> 19:50.583
Some family
we're turning out to be.

19:50.583 --> 19:53.375
Hang on!
We're coming for ya!

19:53.375 --> 19:55.250
(collars beep)

19:59.291 --> 20:01.291
(Hissy panting)

20:04.750 --> 20:07.833
After today, I hope she still
wants to be our sister.

20:07.833 --> 20:11.083
Now that she's family,
she'll always be our sister,

20:11.083 --> 20:13.208
just like you will
always be my brother.

20:13.208 --> 20:16.458
-Keep dog-paddling, Rolly.
-(panting)

20:16.458 --> 20:19.291
At our age, it's called
puppy paddling, Bingo!

20:19.291 --> 20:20.750
Good thing
the river ends soon.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.375
-It does?
-Yup!

20:22.375 --> 20:23.875
Right at that giant waterfall.

20:23.875 --> 20:25.458
Giant waterfall!

20:25.458 --> 20:27.125
(both panting)
Olivia!

20:27.125 --> 20:28.583
Giant waterfall!

20:29.625 --> 20:31.125
(both scream)

20:33.125 --> 20:34.583
-Oh.
-Oh.

20:35.708 --> 20:37.000
Bingo:
That could've been worse.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.958
Hey! We caught up
to Olivia's tank!

20:38.958 --> 20:41.458
Her bowl tipped over.
Olivia's in the lake!

20:41.458 --> 20:43.458
Olivia!
Where are you?

20:43.458 --> 20:45.458
I don't see her. Olivia?

20:45.458 --> 20:47.291
She's gotta be
down there
somewhere.

20:47.291 --> 20:48.583
Poor little fish.

20:48.583 --> 20:50.833
Now she's alone
in this big, big lake.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.708
We have to go down
and find her.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.416
SCUBA puppies
to the rescue.

20:54.416 --> 20:56.416
(collars beep)

20:58.625 --> 21:01.500
Bingo:
She could be anywhere
in this big lake.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.416
Let's spread out.

21:02.416 --> 21:04.583
I don't care
how big this lake is,

21:04.583 --> 21:07.000
I'm not gonna stop
till I find our sister.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.166
Olivia!
Olivia! Olivia!

21:13.416 --> 21:15.458
You've been down there
a long time.

21:15.458 --> 21:16.458
Did you find her?

21:16.458 --> 21:19.291
No. I was hoping
you had seen her.

21:19.291 --> 21:20.458
What I wouldn't give to see her

21:20.458 --> 21:22.708
swimming around
in that purple plant again.

21:22.708 --> 21:25.583
-Rolly, that's it!
-It is?

21:25.583 --> 21:28.083
Think like Olivia,
not like puppies.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.291
What did she like
to do in her bowl?

21:30.291 --> 21:33.000
The plant!
She likes to hide
in that purple plant!

21:33.000 --> 21:35.125
I think I saw
purple plants
in the lake!

21:35.125 --> 21:37.458
I bet she'd like 'em,
because they remind her of home.

21:37.458 --> 21:39.750
Purple plant puppies
to the rescue!

21:39.750 --> 21:41.458
(collars beep)

21:43.625 --> 21:46.250
Olivia?
Where are you?

21:51.125 --> 21:52.166
(gasps)

21:54.083 --> 21:56.500
A fin! I saw
a cute little fin!

21:56.500 --> 21:59.416
Olivia! I'm so glad
you're safe!

21:59.416 --> 22:01.875
Sorry we're not
very good brothers yet.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.375
Do you still want
to be our sister?

22:05.291 --> 22:07.583
-(kisses)
-I think that's
a yes, Rolly.

22:07.583 --> 22:09.208
Aww, I missed you too.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.625
How about we get
you back home?

22:10.625 --> 22:14.375
And when we get there,
I promise we'll be the best
puppy brothers ever.

22:17.250 --> 22:18.625
Who knew playing
hide and seek

22:18.625 --> 22:20.375
with a fish could be
so much fun?

22:20.375 --> 22:21.708
Bingo:
I love Olivia!

22:23.375 --> 22:25.458
(laughs)
Found ya!

22:25.458 --> 22:28.458
I definitely think this is
a mission accomplished...

22:28.458 --> 22:31.583
"fin-ally." "Fin-ally"?

22:31.583 --> 22:34.583
Get it? "Fin."
(laughs)

22:34.583 --> 22:35.416
Oh, Bingo.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.708
After that mission,

22:38.708 --> 22:41.708
I plan on taking
a very long nap.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.000
-It's good to have
you home, sister.
-(door opens, closes)

22:44.000 --> 22:45.708
Hi, guys!

22:45.708 --> 22:48.708
Oh. She looks
so happy here.

22:48.708 --> 22:51.833
Thanks for making
Olivia feel at home.

22:51.833 --> 22:53.583
I'm just glad she is home.

22:53.583 --> 22:55.083
Where'd she go?

22:55.083 --> 22:56.333
Not again!

22:56.333 --> 22:58.625
-(bubbles)
-Of course.

22:58.625 --> 23:01.166
-She's playing...
-Hide and seek.

23:01.166 --> 23:04.000
Well, ready or not,
here we come!

23:04.000 --> 23:07.208
(Bingo and Rolly laughing)

23:08.583 --> 23:12.166
(puppies barking)

23:14.583 --> 23:17.708
(theme music playing)

23:17.708 --> 23:19.250
(barks)

23:23.291 --> 23:24.583
(barks)

23:25.583 --> 23:28.083
(record scratching)

23:34.375 --> 23:35.458
(both bark)

23:39.000 --> 23:40.583
(both bark)
