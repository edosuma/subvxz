Joey, Beck, come here, I want

08:19.124 --> 08:21.376
you guys all to hear this.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.836
Now, listen, the president

08:21.418 --> 08:22.836
of the record company

08:22.877 --> 08:24.921
heard my demo

08:22.877 --> 08:24.921
and wants to meet me.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.089
- That's great!

08:24.963 --> 08:26.089
- Great!

08:26.131 --> 08:27.424
See you guys later.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.469
Jesse, we all just

08:27.466 --> 08:30.469
want you to know that

08:30.510 --> 08:34.889
we're really,

08:30.510 --> 08:34.889
really happy for you.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.141
What's going on?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.476
Well, Jess,

08:36.183 --> 08:37.476
you better get going.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.768
You know, you don't

08:37.517 --> 08:38.768
wanna be late.

08:38.810 --> 08:43.190
Uh...Michelle,

08:38.810 --> 08:43.190
honey, you stay here.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.152
But don't you wanna tell him?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.362
Goodbye?

08:48.403 --> 08:50.613
Uh...yes, I do.

08:50.655 --> 08:51.698
Uh, goodbye, sweetheart.

08:51.739 --> 08:52.949
And, uh..

08:52.991 --> 08:55.994
Hey, good luck,

08:52.991 --> 08:55.994
you manly man, you.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.291
[chuckles]

09:04.002 --> 09:07.922
Boy, can we keep

09:04.002 --> 09:07.922
a secret or what?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.090
[sighs]

09:16.473 --> 09:17.640
Beck, you'll never guess

09:16.473 --> 09:17.640
what happened.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.352
Oh, wait, wait.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.352
I'm not ready yet.

09:21.853 --> 09:25.273
Oh, darling,

09:21.853 --> 09:25.273
you're home at last.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.735
You did all this for me?

09:28.776 --> 09:31.446
Well, uh, I have some really

09:28.776 --> 09:31.446
great news for you.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.531
I got some great news for you.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.907
Get this, the record company

09:33.948 --> 09:35.325
said we had this retro-punk

09:35.367 --> 09:38.328
hip-hop, Euro-trash,

09:35.367 --> 09:38.328
garage beat.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.205
I don't know what the hell it

09:38.370 --> 09:40.205
means, but it must be good

09:40.247 --> 09:41.956
'cause they signed us!

09:41.998 --> 09:43.250
Oh, honey, that's great!

09:43.291 --> 09:44.376
I wanna hear all about

09:43.291 --> 09:44.376
it over dinner.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.461
Alright.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.461
What are we having?

09:46.503 --> 09:48.296
I'm glad you asked.

09:48.338 --> 09:52.050
Because we're having

09:48.338 --> 09:52.050
baby shrimp..

09:52.092 --> 09:53.885
...baby corn..

09:53.927 --> 09:56.388
...and baby back ribs.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.100
Good. 'Cause, baby, I'm starved.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.310
Jess, uh, sweetheart

10:02.352 --> 10:05.313
do you see some sort of theme

10:02.352 --> 10:05.313
running through this meal?

10:05.355 --> 10:07.857
Oh, there's a theme? How fun.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.857
Alright, let me guess.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.776
Um..

10:09.817 --> 10:12.195
Okay. We got

10:09.817 --> 10:12.195
the baby shrimp.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.196
Alright.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.116
Baby ribs, baby cor..

10:16.157 --> 10:18.868
Honey...finger foods.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.078
It's beautiful. I love it.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.457
Very, very clever.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.584
Yeah. Nothing gets by you.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.670
Oh, Beck, I'm so excited,

10:27.794 --> 10:29.670
I can't even believe this.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.339
"Jesse And The Rippers"

10:29.712 --> 10:31.339
are going on tour

10:31.381 --> 10:32.591
this summer for two months.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.342
And get this,

10:32.632 --> 10:34.342
this is the best part.

10:34.384 --> 10:39.514
Our first stop is a state fair

10:34.384 --> 10:39.514
opening up for Aerosmith.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.724
You're gonna open up

10:39.556 --> 10:41.724
for Aerosmith?

10:41.766 --> 10:43.184
Well, technically,

10:41.766 --> 10:43.184
we're opening a few days

10:43.226 --> 10:47.814
before Aerosmith gets there

10:43.226 --> 10:47.814
but...why nitpick?

10:47.855 --> 10:49.149
So you're going away?

10:49.190 --> 10:50.609
Yeah, but you're coming with me.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.901
I mean, you have vacation time

10:50.650 --> 10:51.901
coming up, right?

10:51.943 --> 10:54.821
I mean, the-the timing

10:51.943 --> 10:54.821
is perfect.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.657
- What do you mean?

10:54.862 --> 10:57.657
- I-I mean, think about it.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.741
I mean, we're both young.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.993
We have nothing

10:58.783 --> 10:59.993
tying us down.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.412
No responsibilities.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.412
It's party time!

11:02.454 --> 11:03.746
I'm too excited.

11:02.454 --> 11:03.746
I can't eat.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.666
I got to tell everybody.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.666
I love you so much.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.377
Oh, what-what was

11:06.707 --> 11:09.377
your good news you had?

11:09.419 --> 11:11.338
Oh. It can wait.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.464
Alright.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.802
We're just having a baby.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.854
Ready? Guess.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.190
Uh, tire.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.567
Big Bird!

11:32.609 --> 11:33.860
Lifesaver.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.821
- Cheerio?

11:33.901 --> 11:36.821
- Big Bird!

11:36.863 --> 11:38.657
Michelle, it's not Big Bird.

11:38.697 --> 11:39.991
Um...is it a donut?

11:40.033 --> 11:42.202
Yes, it's a donut.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.202
Next clue.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.870
Big Bird!

11:43.911 --> 11:46.831
- It is not Big Bird.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.831
- It's not Big Bird.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.875
Don't have a cow.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.835
That's it. She got it.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.295
See, donut, half a cow.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.217
Don't have a cow.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.926
I win. My turn.

12:01.596 --> 12:04.474
Wonder if Aunt Becky told

12:01.596 --> 12:04.474
Uncle Jesse about the baby yet.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.018
I don't think so. We haven't

12:04.516 --> 12:07.018
heard him scream.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.520
Man, he's on a roll today.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.105
He's having a baby,

12:08.562 --> 12:11.105
he might have a record deal.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.191
And he's having

12:11.147 --> 12:13.191
a great hair day.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.695
I'm done. You'll never guess.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.488
- Big Bird.

12:18.530 --> 12:22.409
You guys are good at this.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.327
Hey, you, guys, I got the

12:22.450 --> 12:24.327
greatest news in the world.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.037
We know. Way to go.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.497
I haven't told you yet. Oh..

12:27.539 --> 12:29.916
I guess you can

12:27.539 --> 12:29.916
tell by my face. I'm beaming.

12:29.957 --> 12:33.002
We sure can. Congratulations

12:29.957 --> 12:33.002
on your miracle.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.962
I-I-I wouldn't exactly

12:33.044 --> 12:34.962
call it a miracle.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.590
I mean, it took

12:35.004 --> 12:36.590
a lot of hard work.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.596
You know, at the risk

12:40.885 --> 12:42.596
of being vain

12:42.637 --> 12:44.723
some natural raw talent, too.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.896
I mean, you know, I've been

12:49.644 --> 12:51.896
practicing for years.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.484
Friends' garages..

12:56.526 --> 12:58.069
...basements.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.573
And listen,

13:00.196 --> 13:01.573
when the big night comes

13:01.615 --> 13:03.700
I want you all there

13:01.615 --> 13:03.700
with me and Becky

13:03.742 --> 13:07.870
screaming, and yelling,

13:03.742 --> 13:07.870
and-and-and holding up lighters

13:07.912 --> 13:11.999
and-and chanting,

13:07.912 --> 13:11.999
"Jesse! Jesse! Jesse!"

13:12.041 --> 13:14.544
- What?

13:12.041 --> 13:14.544
- What are you talking about?

13:14.586 --> 13:17.880
I'm talking about going on tour

13:14.586 --> 13:17.880
with my band. What di--

13:17.922 --> 13:20.174
Boy oh boy,

13:17.922 --> 13:20.174
is my stomach hungry.

13:20.216 --> 13:23.720
Uh, honey...would you mind goin'

13:20.216 --> 13:23.720
into the kitchen and getting me

13:23.762 --> 13:25.179
a nice big chunk

13:23.762 --> 13:25.179
of beef jerky?

13:25.221 --> 13:26.306
Thank you so much, sweetheart.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.850
I don't know

13:26.347 --> 13:29.850
what I'd do without you.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.102
Are you tryin' to get rid of me?

13:31.144 --> 13:33.271
Oh, no, not at all.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.271
Now beat it.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.066
You didn't tell him

13:35.022 --> 13:37.066
about the baby yet?

13:37.108 --> 13:40.403
Well, I started to,

13:37.108 --> 13:40.403
but he was so excited

13:40.445 --> 13:43.030
about going on tour and not

13:40.445 --> 13:43.030
having any responsibilities

13:43.072 --> 13:44.907
that I-I chickened out.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.243
You have to tell him.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.496
[sighs]

13:47.285 --> 13:49.496
You're right, Danny.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.955
I'll just look him

13:49.537 --> 13:50.955
straight in the eye and say

13:50.997 --> 13:54.000
Jess, you wanna play

13:50.997 --> 13:54.000
Picture Charade?

13:55.627 --> 13:57.295
- No.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.295
- Uh, sure you do.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.255
Of course you do.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.255
Yes, you do.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.757
Uh, just-just come back

13:59.297 --> 14:00.757
here, honey

14:00.799 --> 14:02.550
and-and have a seat

14:00.799 --> 14:02.550
right over there.

14:02.592 --> 14:06.513
Uh, now, everybody, this game

14:02.592 --> 14:06.513
is just for Jesse, okay?

14:06.554 --> 14:07.888
Alrght, Jess, you just

14:06.554 --> 14:07.888
sit right there

14:07.930 --> 14:09.516
and pay very close attention.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.687
Alright. Now,

14:10.642 --> 14:13.687
it's a movie title.

14:13.728 --> 14:17.190
"Teenage Mutant

14:13.728 --> 14:17.190
Ninja Turtles."

14:17.231 --> 14:20.527
No, Michelle.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.527
That's cheese.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.111
Cheese.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.071
Yeah, but it's a movie title.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.367
Oh, um, simple,

14:24.113 --> 14:27.367
"Dances With Cheese."

14:27.408 --> 14:28.951
- No.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.951
- Uh, uh, alright.

14:28.993 --> 14:33.080
- Um..."Driving Miss Cheesy."

14:28.993 --> 14:33.080
- No!

14:33.122 --> 14:34.332
Oh, I got it, I got it,

14:33.122 --> 14:34.332
I got it.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.459
"Home Provolone," right?

14:36.501 --> 14:38.085
Next clue.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.796
Um, half.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.881
- Okay, cheese half, cheese h--

14:39.838 --> 14:41.881
- Look, uh, okay, great.

14:41.922 --> 14:45.176
- Now, next clue.

14:41.922 --> 14:45.176
- Bottle. Um, beaker.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.803
'Bottle. Vase.'

14:46.845 --> 14:48.429
Ink!

14:48.471 --> 14:50.765
Gee, you're good, Uncle Jesse.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.226
Yeah, I'm pretty good. Okay.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.646
Uh, cheese half ink.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.646
Cheese half ink.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.147
She-she's hav, she's having.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.107
Yes, yes, "She's having."

14:58.189 --> 15:00.107
Okay, last clue.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.444
(Jesse)

15:00.149 --> 15:03.444
'She's having a..

15:00.149 --> 15:03.444
She's having a..'

15:03.486 --> 15:06.155
She's having a hot dog!

15:06.197 --> 15:07.699
[sighs]

15:06.197 --> 15:07.699
No!

15:07.741 --> 15:10.034
What-what? It's clearly

15:07.741 --> 15:10.034
a bun with a wiener stick

15:10.076 --> 15:11.745
with a happy face.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.873
No, Jesse, it's not "She's

15:11.786 --> 15:14.873
having a hot dog."

15:14.914 --> 15:17.417
It's "She's having a baby,"

15:14.914 --> 15:17.417
and the "She" is me.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.668
I'm having a baby!

15:18.710 --> 15:19.836
Oh, you having a..

15:18.710 --> 15:19.836
Did you hear that?

15:19.878 --> 15:22.129
She's having.. What?

15:22.171 --> 15:24.591
You're having a baby?

15:22.171 --> 15:24.591
How did this happen?

15:24.632 --> 15:26.509
Well, I know

15:24.632 --> 15:26.509
how it happened.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.968
- Really?

15:26.551 --> 15:27.968
- Huh.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.679
You know what this means?

15:29.721 --> 15:31.180
We're having a baby!

15:31.222 --> 15:33.307
I'm gonna be a father!

15:40.064 --> 15:42.275
"Goodnight, stars.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.944
"Goodnight, air.

15:44.985 --> 15:48.531
Goodnight, noises everywhere."

15:48.573 --> 15:51.117
That was beautiful.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.413
Thank you. There'll be another

15:52.744 --> 15:55.413
performance tomorrow night.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.540
Same time, same chair.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.878
Me and Glen will be there.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.548
Honey, let's talk

16:01.920 --> 16:05.548
about Glen for a second.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.759
You know, it's fun

16:05.590 --> 16:07.759
to have a Glen

16:07.801 --> 16:10.511
or pretend duck

16:07.801 --> 16:10.511
like Norton

16:10.553 --> 16:12.012
or my best friend

16:10.553 --> 16:12.012
when I was a kid

16:12.054 --> 16:15.475
Terry the talking

16:12.054 --> 16:15.475
washcloth.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.727
But what is it

16:15.516 --> 16:17.727
you like about Glen?

16:17.769 --> 16:19.186
He's my friend.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.440
My other friends are gone.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.693
Oh, because

16:22.482 --> 16:25.693
pre-school just ended.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.822
Oh, so that's why

16:25.735 --> 16:28.822
Glen just showed up.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.409
Yeah, but don't worry,

16:31.115 --> 16:33.409
next week, you start kiddy camp

16:33.451 --> 16:35.745
and you're gonna meet

16:33.451 --> 16:35.745
all kinds of new friends.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.997
- Really?

16:35.787 --> 16:37.997
- Yeah, really.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.166
And If you want to,

16:38.038 --> 16:40.166
you can take Glen with you.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.418
That's okay.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.418
He talks too much.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.128
Sorry, Glen.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.382
I love you, Michelle.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.051
I love you, daddy.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.267
You know, pretty soon,

16:56.516 --> 16:58.267
it's gonna be your kid

16:58.309 --> 17:00.269
saying, "I love you, daddy."

17:00.311 --> 17:01.646
Can't wait.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.399
I remember when

17:02.730 --> 17:05.399
D.J. was born..

17:05.441 --> 17:07.109
Pam and I, we looked down

17:07.151 --> 17:08.444
at this innocent little baby

17:08.486 --> 17:10.780
that we actually brought

17:08.486 --> 17:10.780
into the world..

17:10.822 --> 17:13.073
[inhales deeply]

17:10.822 --> 17:13.073
...and it-it felt like..

17:13.115 --> 17:16.661
I don't know.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.661
This is why we're here.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.958
So...you wanna do the honors

17:18.454 --> 17:21.958
and tuck Michelle in?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.878
Yeah. I can use

17:22.000 --> 17:24.878
all the practice I can get.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.672
[chuckles]

17:24.919 --> 17:27.672
Goodnight, honey.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.216
- Goodnight.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.011
Aw, Michelle, Michelle.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.265
Your Aunt Becky and I

17:35.930 --> 17:38.265
are having a baby.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.851
You're gonna have

17:38.307 --> 17:39.851
a new little cousin.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.896
- Is it boy or a girl?

17:39.893 --> 17:42.896
- Well, we don't know yet.

17:42.937 --> 17:46.649
Then you can name it

17:42.937 --> 17:46.649
"Big Bird."

17:46.691 --> 17:49.652
I can't believe that

17:46.691 --> 17:49.652
I'm gonna be a daddy.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.573
You think I'm ready

17:50.945 --> 17:53.573
to raise a little kid?

17:53.614 --> 17:58.828
You're doing

17:53.614 --> 17:58.828
a very good job with me.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.872
Thank you.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.415
Let me tell you something.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.668
I'm gonna be the best darn daddy

18:02.456 --> 18:05.668
a kid could ever have.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.253
And I'm not gonna miss

18:05.710 --> 18:07.253
one second

18:07.294 --> 18:09.839
of little Big Bird's life.

18:09.881 --> 18:12.759
Starting right now,

18:09.881 --> 18:12.759
I'm not leaving Becky's side.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.219
You aren't going away?

18:12.800 --> 18:15.219
Goody!

18:15.261 --> 18:18.264
Of course I'm not

18:15.261 --> 18:18.264
going away.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.933
Oh, the band.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.393
[sighs]

18:24.520 --> 18:25.939
Well, it's just something

18:24.520 --> 18:25.939
I always wanted to do.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.024
Go on the road and..

18:28.066 --> 18:29.734
...have a deal

18:28.066 --> 18:29.734
with a record company.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.151
I can't let the guys down.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.362
I mean, without me,

18:31.193 --> 18:33.362
"Jesse And The Rippers"

18:33.404 --> 18:35.489
would be "And The Rippers."

18:37.867 --> 18:40.160
Then again, I-I-I can't

18:37.867 --> 18:40.160
let Becky down.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.163
I mean, she's my wife. I..

18:43.205 --> 18:44.206
How do I choose?

18:44.248 --> 18:45.416
Easy. Put out your hand

18:45.458 --> 18:49.087
and play

18:45.458 --> 18:49.087
the Eenie-Meenie game.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.213
Come on, Michelle,

18:49.128 --> 18:51.213
I'm an adult.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.299
Do you want my help or not?

18:55.009 --> 18:57.011
Eenie meenie miney moe

18:57.053 --> 18:59.263
catch a tiger by the toe.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.558
If he hollers, let him go.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.103
You better stay with Big Bird.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.357
That's exactly

19:08.188 --> 19:10.357
what I was thinking.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.113
Michelle, I love

19:12.443 --> 19:15.113
our little talks.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.448
You always make things

19:15.154 --> 19:17.448
seem so simple.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.994
Thanks for the advice,

19:18.699 --> 19:20.994
shorty.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.162
Just doing my job.

19:28.459 --> 19:32.880
Whoa! This baby thing happened

19:28.459 --> 19:32.880
lot faster than I thought.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.383
Honey, will you still love me

19:32.922 --> 19:36.383
when I look like this?

19:36.425 --> 19:38.177
Of course.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.177
It'll be great.

19:38.218 --> 19:41.472
I'll have a place for my popcorn

19:38.218 --> 19:41.472
when we watch TV.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.683
- You're very funny.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.683
- Yeah.

19:43.724 --> 19:44.976
[sighs]

19:45.018 --> 19:47.561
Now, listen, uh..

19:47.603 --> 19:48.896
I've had

19:47.603 --> 19:48.896
some expert advice

19:48.938 --> 19:50.564
and I've made

19:48.938 --> 19:50.564
an important decision.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.150
I'm canceling the tour

19:50.606 --> 19:52.150
and I'm gonna stay

19:52.191 --> 19:53.985
with you this summer.

19:54.027 --> 19:58.572
Jess...who'd you get

19:54.027 --> 19:58.572
this expert advice from?

19:58.614 --> 20:01.200
Michelle.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.870
She used the Eenie-Miney-Moe

20:01.241 --> 20:03.870
method.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.329
Honey, that's very sweet.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.707
But what are you gonna miss

20:05.371 --> 20:07.707
in the next eight weeks?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.167
Morning sickness?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.459
Midnight cravings?

20:10.501 --> 20:11.794
Swollen ankles?

20:10.501 --> 20:11.794
Mood swings?

20:11.836 --> 20:13.253
Hey, look, I don't care.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.007
I'm gonna be right by your side

20:13.295 --> 20:16.007
24 hours a day.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.967
Every time you turn around,

20:16.049 --> 20:17.967
I'm gonna be there

20:18.009 --> 20:20.970
helping you, supporting you,

20:18.009 --> 20:20.970
whatever you need.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.181
That's really gonna

20:21.012 --> 20:23.181
get on my nerves.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.225
Is this a mood swing? Huh?

20:26.266 --> 20:27.518
'Cause I'm there for you.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.518
Watch. See?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.479
Hey, hi, babe.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.479
I'm there for you, babe.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.522
See how that works?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.983
[chuckles]

20:31.564 --> 20:33.983
Honey..

20:34.025 --> 20:36.318
I think it's very sweet

20:34.025 --> 20:36.318
that you wanna be by my side

20:36.360 --> 20:39.321
but...we don't

20:36.360 --> 20:39.321
have to stay home.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.323
I mean, it's like you said.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.323
I have some time off.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.367
I could take my vacation,

20:41.365 --> 20:43.367
I can go on the road with you.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.119
And-and I could see you

20:43.409 --> 20:45.119
on the weekends, too.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.163
Well, you can't travel

20:45.161 --> 20:47.163
in your condition.

20:47.205 --> 20:48.622
Yes, I can.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.708
The doctor said it's perfectly

20:48.664 --> 20:50.708
safe for me to travel.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.418
How do I know? I've never been

20:50.750 --> 20:52.418
pregnant before.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.878
[chuckles]

20:53.920 --> 20:56.338
Well, I'll be fine.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.340
Jess, I know how much

20:56.380 --> 20:58.340
this tour means to you

20:58.382 --> 21:00.843
and I don't want you

20:58.382 --> 21:00.843
to miss it.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.179
And that's what this marriage

21:00.885 --> 21:03.179
is all about.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.681
Making each others

21:03.221 --> 21:05.681
dreams come true.

21:05.723 --> 21:08.935
Well, you already made the best

21:05.723 --> 21:08.935
dream of all come true.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.856
So you're really happy about

21:10.686 --> 21:13.856
having the baby right now?

21:13.898 --> 21:15.524
Ah, well,

21:13.898 --> 21:15.524
I mean, you know

21:15.566 --> 21:17.777
we didn't plan it,

21:15.566 --> 21:17.777
but who cares?

21:17.818 --> 21:20.238
Yes. I'm-I'm,

21:17.818 --> 21:20.238
I'm so happy.

21:23.241 --> 21:25.325
Thanks for making me

21:23.241 --> 21:25.325
be a daddy.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.205
Thanks for making me a mommy.

21:29.247 --> 21:30.414
[chuckles]

21:30.456 --> 21:32.250
I love you.

21:34.210 --> 21:38.131
Hello. There's

21:34.210 --> 21:38.131
a kid in the room.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.966
Michele, what are

21:38.172 --> 21:39.966
you doing awake?

21:40.007 --> 21:43.636
I didn't say goodnight

21:40.007 --> 21:43.636
to Big Bird.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.138
"Big Bird?"

21:46.513 --> 21:49.558
That's our baby.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.352
You named our baby "Big Bird?"

21:52.394 --> 21:53.729
Well, you know,

21:52.394 --> 21:53.729
just, just for now

21:53.771 --> 21:55.439
until we find out if

21:53.771 --> 21:55.439
it's a boy or girl

21:55.481 --> 21:59.735
or a nine foot

21:55.481 --> 21:59.735
yellow muppet.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.696
Goodnight, Cousin Big Bird.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.696
See you soon.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.990
[laughs]

22:04.031 --> 22:06.533
Get over here,

22:04.031 --> 22:06.533
you silly girl.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.083
[theme music]
