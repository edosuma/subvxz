of the operational centers

I saw someone running away
from here. Was it the woman?

37:20.321 --> 37:22.155
- Yes.
- Why did she leave the shelter?

37:22.323 --> 37:24.324
She was upset.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.534
Do you think she may harm herself?

37:28.746 --> 37:30.538
There's a dangerous precipice
near here.

37:30.706 --> 37:33.250
- She was headed in that direction.
- It's possible.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.709
Then we should go find her.

37:36.128 --> 37:39.464
You stay here. Keep warm.
I'll go and look for her.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.675
We will go together.

37:46.639 --> 37:49.015
PICARD:
Anna!

37:54.313 --> 37:56.481
Anna!

38:01.112 --> 38:05.448
Captain, this ridge extends
for a kilometer in either direction.

38:05.866 --> 38:08.910
We can search it twice as fast
if we separate.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.709
Anna?

38:16.961 --> 38:19.212
Anna!

38:23.259 --> 38:25.010
Anna.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.890
- Anna.
- Stay away from me.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.900
You don't have to do this.
I found Voval, the shuttle pilot.

38:41.068 --> 38:42.736
He's still alive.

38:42.903 --> 38:45.697
He can help us get away from here.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.866
I don't care.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.455
I'll jump,

38:54.040 --> 38:56.458
unless you promise to love me.

38:59.545 --> 39:01.212
No.

39:02.965 --> 39:05.759
No, I won't promise.

39:07.511 --> 39:10.472
You have been manipulating me,
haven't you?

39:10.639 --> 39:12.807
Jean-Luc, what are you saying?

39:12.975 --> 39:14.100
The necklace.

39:14.935 --> 39:16.269
It broke.

39:16.437 --> 39:19.356
I saw it in the cargo freighter
on the floor by the fire.

39:19.523 --> 39:21.816
I left it there.
Now it's around your neck.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.860
It's whole. How?

39:24.945 --> 39:27.489
Tell me you love me.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.657
I must know.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.788
Where's Voval?

39:35.373 --> 39:38.917
Isn't it convenient
that he arrived moments after you left?

39:39.085 --> 39:41.836
That he insisted
that I come here to look for you?

39:42.004 --> 39:46.132
That I find you, here on the ledge,
ready to jump?

39:46.300 --> 39:49.010
That's very good timing,
don't you think?

39:49.845 --> 39:51.221
Jean-Luc...

39:51.389 --> 39:53.973
Are you and Voval working together?

39:54.183 --> 39:56.810
He is the only one who could have
brought you the necklace.

40:00.439 --> 40:03.441
Tell me about your love,

40:03.776 --> 40:05.527
or I'll jump.

40:06.987 --> 40:09.322
Go ahead. Why don't you do it?

40:09.824 --> 40:12.909
It's a long way down.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.619
Must be 200 meters.

40:14.787 --> 40:17.664
You'd die instantly
if that's what you want.

40:17.832 --> 40:21.167
But l don't think that it really is.

40:29.635 --> 40:33.304
- I have failed.
- Failed?

40:33.681 --> 40:36.599
Voval, what is going on?

40:37.017 --> 40:40.186
My name is Ambassador Voval.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.438
Ambassador?

40:41.605 --> 40:43.898
My mission
was to study human intimacy,

40:44.066 --> 40:47.318
specifically the concept
you call love.

40:47.486 --> 40:51.197
In our study of your culture, we
did not understand certain concepts,

40:51.365 --> 40:54.075
so we sent three representatives
to study them.

40:54.243 --> 40:57.078
To experience them.

40:57.246 --> 41:02.041
But why did you believe
that bringing me here

41:02.209 --> 41:05.462
would give you
a better understanding of love?

41:05.629 --> 41:07.297
Several years ago
we discovered the remains

41:07.465 --> 41:09.549
of the Terellian freighter
on this planet.

41:09.717 --> 41:13.136
The ship contained logs
written by a single survivor.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.138
A human woman.

41:15.306 --> 41:19.225
That was our first contact
with the human culture.

41:19.393 --> 41:21.728
The woman lived alone here
for seven years

41:21.896 --> 41:24.689
until another human
crashed on this planet.

41:24.857 --> 41:26.274
A human male.

41:28.068 --> 41:29.736
And the man was injured,

41:29.904 --> 41:34.824
and she nursed him back to health
and they fell in love.

41:34.992 --> 41:37.202
In the logs,
she described many concepts

41:37.369 --> 41:39.496
we found difficult to understand.

41:39.663 --> 41:43.416
Pleasure, antagonism, love.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.251
These were alien to us.

41:45.419 --> 41:47.545
We wished to experience them
for ourselves.

41:47.713 --> 41:50.673
Ambassador Loquel
was sent to experience pleasure.

41:50.841 --> 41:54.177
Byleth was sent to experience
antagonism.

41:54.345 --> 41:58.890
And I was sent to experience love.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.309
Was this wrong?

42:06.607 --> 42:09.526
Let me just say that

42:11.278 --> 42:14.447
we would not take
such a direct approach.

42:14.907 --> 42:19.744
Ambassador,
I have to tell you that in my culture,

42:20.704 --> 42:24.290
what you have done
would be considered a crime.

42:25.751 --> 42:27.168
Crime?

42:28.420 --> 42:32.840
Well, we'll talk about it later.

42:33.008 --> 42:36.970
For now,
I think we should get off this planet.

42:37.137 --> 42:40.223
Am I right in assuming
that the damage to the shuttle

42:40.391 --> 42:42.350
is not as bad as it seems?

42:42.518 --> 42:44.852
That is correct.
We can leave at any time.

42:45.688 --> 42:48.398
I think that now would be quite nice.

42:55.197 --> 42:56.239
You look a little sore.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.116
Lieutenant Worf
was kind enough to engage me

42:58.284 --> 43:00.577
in 1 1 hours
of holodeck battle exercises.

43:00.744 --> 43:01.786
- Eleven hours?
- Yes.

43:01.954 --> 43:05.415
I learned a great deal
about the concept of antagonism.

43:05.666 --> 43:09.586
It was excruciating.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.838
Counselor,
these are bio-enzymatic supplements

43:12.006 --> 43:13.840
my people consume for food.

43:14.008 --> 43:17.427
I'm afraid you'll find they are not
as delicious as your chocolate.

43:17.595 --> 43:21.973
After the past few days,
I could use something a little bland.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.350
Goodbye, ambassador.

43:24.810 --> 43:27.478
- Fascinating species.
BYLETH: lndeed.

43:30.357 --> 43:31.608
Thank you, captain.

43:31.775 --> 43:34.068
This has been
an enlightening experience.

43:34.236 --> 43:36.195
For me as well, ambassador.

43:36.363 --> 43:40.783
I am sorry if our diplomatic methods
offended you.

43:41.076 --> 43:45.747
No, on the contrary,
I found your approach intriguing.

43:45.914 --> 43:50.376
We humans tend to take a rather
balanced approach towards life.

43:50.544 --> 43:53.254
Never too much, never too little.

43:53.422 --> 43:56.549
And it's very nice to find a culture

43:56.717 --> 44:02.013
that is willing to take an experience
to its furthest extreme.

44:03.515 --> 44:07.101
- Goodbye, captain.
- Ambassador.
