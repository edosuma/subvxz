WEBVTT

00:10.646 --> 00:12.229
Morning, Francis.

00:13.231 --> 00:14.865
Is it?

00:14.867 --> 00:16.283
Where are you going?

00:16.285 --> 00:17.618
What, you think I got
nothing better to do

00:17.620 --> 00:19.070
than to sit around here all day?

00:19.072 --> 00:22.690
I'm having lunch at
Sartello's with Tim Kincaid.

00:22.692 --> 00:24.525
He didn't get enough of you
when he was mayor?

00:24.527 --> 00:25.693
I remind him of the glory days.

00:25.695 --> 00:27.211
Well, when Mayor Poole
leaves office,

00:27.213 --> 00:29.296
I'll be the last one
he wants to have lunch with.

00:29.298 --> 00:31.198
Well, I tell better jokes
than you do.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.700
Here, take my
Sartello's card.

00:32.702 --> 00:33.801
No, thanks.

00:33.803 --> 00:35.302
Sartello's is cash only.

00:35.304 --> 00:36.303
I know that.

00:36.305 --> 00:37.972
And I got it.

00:42.260 --> 00:43.877
Okay.

00:45.430 --> 00:47.014
<i>This massage parlor--</i>

00:47.016 --> 00:49.150
it's a legit place of business?

00:49.152 --> 00:51.051
As far as I know.
Uh-huh.

00:51.053 --> 00:52.820
How's the vic?

00:52.822 --> 00:54.221
Not likely.

00:54.223 --> 00:55.373
Uh, where'd they take him?

00:55.375 --> 00:56.323
St. Victor's.

00:56.325 --> 00:59.160
Okay, so we got
three shots fired,

00:59.162 --> 01:00.861
but you only got
two shell casings.

01:00.863 --> 01:02.062
Where's the third?

01:09.287 --> 01:10.421
Hey, well, what do
you know--

01:10.423 --> 01:12.506
there's a third
shell casing.

01:12.508 --> 01:15.092
Make sure you get that.
Any witnesses?

01:15.094 --> 01:17.545
Just the lady
your partner's talking to.

01:17.547 --> 01:19.213
Good. Thanks.

01:20.382 --> 01:22.216
Did you get a look
at the shooter?

01:24.587 --> 01:25.770
No.

01:25.772 --> 01:27.921
Can you describe
what he was wearing?

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.152 --> 01:41.235
She doesn't know.

01:41.237 --> 01:43.904
What else did she say?

01:43.906 --> 01:45.439
That even she could remember
what he was wearing

01:45.441 --> 01:46.407
or what he looked like,

01:46.409 --> 01:47.775
she wouldn't tell you.

01:47.777 --> 01:49.126
She thinks all cops
are corrupt.

01:49.128 --> 01:51.829
That helping you might
bring her bad luck.

01:51.831 --> 01:53.748
Well, you tell her for me
that it is a pleasure

01:53.750 --> 01:56.717
dealing with such an upstanding
member of society.

01:59.639 --> 02:01.088
Whoa.

02:02.057 --> 02:04.141
Any luck?
She's not cooperating.

02:04.143 --> 02:06.811
Ah, she doesn't trust cops.

02:06.813 --> 02:08.461
Anyhow.

02:08.464 --> 02:09.930
Guy's laying down,
mid-massage,

02:09.931 --> 02:11.965
shooter busts in the door,
starts blasting,

02:11.967 --> 02:13.100
turns around, walks away.

02:13.102 --> 02:15.152
What do we know
about the victim?

02:15.154 --> 02:17.855
Uh, the victim is
Michael Reade, 32;

02:17.857 --> 02:19.523
he owns a car
dealership in Queens.

02:19.525 --> 02:21.492
Three shots-- one to
the side, two in the back.

02:21.494 --> 02:23.360
Does he have a history?

02:23.362 --> 02:25.763
Yeah, he was busted for
possession five years ago,

02:25.765 --> 02:28.165
but he skated because the
ADA made a deal with him

02:28.167 --> 02:30.701
in exchange for testifying
against some heavy hitters.

02:31.870 --> 02:33.921
Who'd you speak to
in the D.A.'s office?

02:33.923 --> 02:35.206
My sister.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.374
Is there any aspect
of public service

02:37.376 --> 02:39.326
you Reagans are
not involved in?

02:39.328 --> 02:41.762
Politics.
Too many crooks in that.

02:50.639 --> 02:51.856
Morning.

03:13.211 --> 03:15.162
What?
Move.

03:15.164 --> 03:16.213
What do you mean, move?

03:16.215 --> 03:18.465
Hey, that's my money, punk!

03:18.467 --> 03:22.469
I will shoot your ass.

03:41.106 --> 03:42.439
Come on.

03:48.914 --> 03:51.115
Our numbers are down
across the board,

03:51.117 --> 03:53.500
except for grand larceny
of cell phones.

03:53.502 --> 03:55.119
That's going backwards.

03:55.121 --> 03:56.670
Commissioner?

03:58.623 --> 04:01.508
I want a new strategy...
Excuse me.

04:02.260 --> 04:04.345
And I want it on my desk

04:04.347 --> 04:07.131
by the end of the day.

04:08.516 --> 04:13.086
There's only a few people
who can walk into this office

04:13.088 --> 04:15.940
unannounced, at will.

04:15.942 --> 04:18.425
Could it be you're starting
to take advantage of that?

04:30.155 --> 04:32.489
What's wrong?

05:01.285 --> 05:04.003
Okay, how about
the eyes?

05:08.159 --> 05:09.959
Nah, they're closer together.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.845
Okay. Closer.

05:12.897 --> 05:14.097
Here you go, Grandpa.

05:14.099 --> 05:16.015
You have to keep
the ice pack on your head.

05:16.634 --> 05:19.819
I don't know why you just don't
go back to work.

05:19.821 --> 05:21.404
I could have gone down

05:21.406 --> 05:22.939
to One Police Plaza
instead of bringing

05:22.941 --> 05:24.357
this fellow
all the way up here.

05:24.359 --> 05:26.693
Okay, well, I think Dad thought
you might prefer to do it...

05:26.695 --> 05:28.578
I would prefer if people
didn't keep treating me

05:28.580 --> 05:30.363
with kid gloves.

05:31.198 --> 05:34.834
Okay. Now, how about the nose?

05:34.836 --> 05:36.503
Well...

05:36.505 --> 05:38.204
Grandpa, hey.
Are you okay?

05:38.206 --> 05:40.156
Of course I'm okay.
I'm sitting here, aren't I?

05:40.158 --> 05:42.258
Yeah, I guess that
answers my question.

05:42.260 --> 05:43.209
No, the nostrils

05:43.211 --> 05:44.844
are wider than that.
Okay.

05:44.846 --> 05:46.096
I'm just ticked off

05:46.098 --> 05:49.099
because I didn't get a chance
to use my own gun.

05:49.101 --> 05:51.050
Just for the record,

05:51.052 --> 05:53.386
ankle holsters suck.

05:55.973 --> 05:57.974
Thanks, Detective.

05:57.976 --> 05:59.225
No problem.

05:59.227 --> 06:00.610
How about now?

06:00.612 --> 06:02.362
Closer, but the hair is longer.

06:02.364 --> 06:04.114
He didn't even
get checked out?

06:04.116 --> 06:06.182
Do you want to try
convincing him?

06:06.184 --> 06:07.283
What if he's got
internal injuries or something?

06:07.285 --> 06:09.119
Okay, well, I put a call in
to the doctor,

06:09.121 --> 06:10.537
but I am doing the best I can.

06:10.539 --> 06:12.989
When I got that call from Dad,

06:12.991 --> 06:14.958
the first thing
that I thought about...

06:14.960 --> 06:16.493
I know, I know,
but he's clearly okay.

06:16.495 --> 06:17.544
He's a little rattled.

06:17.546 --> 06:19.045
Yeah, well,
he's not the only one.

06:19.047 --> 06:21.831
- Pop?
- In here.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.082
You all right?

06:23.084 --> 06:24.167
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:24.169 --> 06:25.668
But I'm not going
to the hospital.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.036
I know what you're going to say.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.589
"Why didn't you just let
the little punk take your money?

06:29.591 --> 06:30.924
"Why'd you have to fight back?

06:30.926 --> 06:33.226
Why didn't you just
let the PD handle it?"

06:33.228 --> 06:35.044
Actually, that's not
what I was going to say.

06:35.046 --> 06:37.147
You're thickheaded,
Irish and a war vet.

06:37.149 --> 06:38.648
It's in your DNA to fight back.

06:38.650 --> 06:41.768
What I was going to say was:
How's the other guy?

06:49.026 --> 06:50.226
Hey.

06:50.228 --> 06:51.828
I put in a call to the hospital.

06:51.830 --> 06:54.881
Vic's in surgery--
no family, no visitors yet.

06:54.883 --> 06:56.065
What is that?
Rooibus.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.417
Rooi-what?
Rooibus.

06:57.419 --> 06:59.169
It's good for the
immune system.

07:00.238 --> 07:02.338
Smells like air freshener.

07:02.340 --> 07:03.573
What do you got?

07:03.575 --> 07:05.542
Crime scene lifted partial
prints off the shell casing,

07:05.544 --> 07:07.093
but there isn't enough
to match anything.

07:07.095 --> 07:08.511
The gun was a
nine millimeter.

07:08.513 --> 07:10.413
Great.
So we know the perp was a male

07:10.415 --> 07:11.598
who used a nine millimeter.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.266
That narrows things down.
You get anything else?

07:13.268 --> 07:15.751
Yes. He has a business partner--
Adrian Baez.

07:15.753 --> 07:17.086
They own the car dealership
together.

07:17.088 --> 07:19.055
And it looks like that
was his last call.

07:19.057 --> 07:20.106
Okay.

07:20.108 --> 07:21.858
Do you want some?

07:21.860 --> 07:23.560
Oh. No, thank you.

07:23.562 --> 07:25.612
Uh, any priors on this guy?

07:25.614 --> 07:28.097
Possession, assault,
nothing recent.

07:28.099 --> 07:30.116
But two ex-cons
sharing profits,

07:30.118 --> 07:32.435
that's enough motive for me.
Yeah.

07:32.437 --> 07:34.187
Okay, we'll start
with the partner.

07:34.189 --> 07:36.489
They usually know
all the secrets anyway.

07:36.491 --> 07:38.708
I don't know your secrets.

07:41.612 --> 07:44.664
I never eat or drink anything
I can't pronounce.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.141
I told you,
he took today off.

07:55.143 --> 07:57.143
Was that unusual?
Not really.

07:57.145 --> 07:58.645
He'd take a day
here and there.

07:58.647 --> 08:00.263
Did he have any problems
with anyone?

08:00.265 --> 08:01.598
Not that I'm
aware of.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.682
Exactly, uh... Hold on.

08:02.684 --> 08:04.800
How did you and Michael Reade
come to hook up?

08:04.802 --> 08:06.603
We met in Rikers.

08:06.605 --> 08:08.771
Uh-huh. Let me guess--
you bonded over the fact

08:08.773 --> 08:10.273
that you were both innocent?

08:10.275 --> 08:11.908
My personal philosophy

08:11.910 --> 08:13.809
is that no one is
innocent, Detective.

08:13.811 --> 08:15.662
Right. So two
ex-cons hook up

08:15.664 --> 08:17.146
in prison, get out of the joint,

08:17.148 --> 08:18.831
and you open up
a business like this.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.950
How exactly does that happen?
The usual way.

08:20.952 --> 08:23.119
We pooled our money
and we started out small.

08:23.121 --> 08:25.038
He does the
business side,

08:25.040 --> 08:26.656
and I'm the people person.
Mm-hmm.

08:26.658 --> 08:28.041
But you two had a falling out.

08:28.043 --> 08:31.494
If you're asking did I kill him,
the answer is no.

08:31.496 --> 08:34.464
Where were you today
at 2:00 p.m.?

08:34.466 --> 08:35.682
Right here.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.635
Closing a deal on a cherry,
low-mileage Explorer.

08:38.636 --> 08:39.686
Do you know anyone

08:39.688 --> 08:41.187
who had a beef
with Michael?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.672
Anybody who wanted him dead?

08:42.674 --> 08:44.274
Anybody he was fighting with?

08:44.275 --> 08:45.942
Well, he was going
through a divorce.

08:45.944 --> 08:48.061
And not a, uh--
what do they call it?--

08:48.063 --> 08:50.730
um, amicable one.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.582
Detective Reagan.

09:09.584 --> 09:11.968
This is my partner,
Detective Lansing.

09:11.970 --> 09:13.386
What do you want?

09:13.388 --> 09:15.638
We're here to talk to you about
your husband, Michael Reade.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.507
Ex-husband.

09:17.509 --> 09:19.559
Your ex-husband.

09:19.561 --> 09:21.711
Why? Is he in trouble again?

09:21.713 --> 09:23.479
Again?

09:23.481 --> 09:25.064
About a year after
we got married,

09:25.066 --> 09:26.983
he got busted
for selling pot and coke.

09:26.985 --> 09:29.268
Then he ended up testifying
against our friends

09:29.270 --> 09:30.570
in exchange for a deal.

09:30.572 --> 09:31.604
Any of those
friends

09:31.606 --> 09:33.022
hold a grudge against
your husband?

09:33.024 --> 09:34.357
Oh, ex-husband.

09:34.359 --> 09:35.942
How would I know?

09:35.944 --> 09:38.060
They stopped talking
to both of us after that.

09:38.062 --> 09:39.696
Then, when he got
out of prison,

09:39.698 --> 09:40.947
he found religion.

09:40.949 --> 09:43.566
Couldn't stop trying
to save me.

09:43.568 --> 09:45.368
What's with all
the questions?

09:45.370 --> 09:47.286
What did he do?

09:47.288 --> 09:49.572
Your ex-husband
was shot earlier today.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.508
Is he dead?

09:52.510 --> 09:55.011
No, he's in the hospital,
in critical condition.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.466
Good.

10:00.468 --> 10:02.385
It's about time

10:02.387 --> 10:05.355
someone tried to kill
that son of a bitch.

10:05.357 --> 10:07.089
Hope he dies.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.985
Tony did this to me.

10:18.987 --> 10:20.603
Tony who?

10:20.605 --> 10:23.373
He wants to kill me.

10:24.575 --> 10:26.576
Excuse me.

10:27.444 --> 10:29.045
This patient has asked
for last rites.

10:29.047 --> 10:31.130
I'm sorry, Father.

10:39.923 --> 10:41.891
Come on, Frank.
You got to trust me now.

10:41.893 --> 10:44.126
Why is it, Angelo,
when you say "trust me,"

10:44.128 --> 10:45.812
I always want
to check my wallet?

10:45.814 --> 10:48.014
Frank, come on.

10:48.016 --> 10:49.465
You know me.

10:49.467 --> 10:51.984
I don't have to tell you
how many clients I've gotten off

10:51.986 --> 10:54.520
or how many Harvard grads
I wiped the floor with.

10:54.522 --> 10:56.189
But you? Come on.

10:56.191 --> 10:57.807
I would never mess
with the only PC

10:57.809 --> 10:59.609
who actually grew up
in Brooklyn,

10:59.611 --> 11:01.694
who I played stickball
in the street with.

11:01.696 --> 11:02.829
That was a million years ago.

11:02.831 --> 11:04.864
Yeah.

11:04.866 --> 11:06.115
Every kid from Bensonhurst

11:06.117 --> 11:07.834
either became a cop
or a criminal, right?

11:07.836 --> 11:09.619
I always thought
you'd be mayor.

11:10.755 --> 11:13.589
You know me, I always went
where the money was.

11:13.591 --> 11:16.158
Besides, come on, you deal with
more crooks in city politics

11:16.160 --> 11:17.260
than I ever will.

11:17.262 --> 11:19.595
Well, difference is, I
get to put them away.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.834
Frank, we've always been
up front with each other.

11:24.836 --> 11:26.803
I'm up front.
You're...

11:26.805 --> 11:28.304
Looking out
for your best interest.

11:28.306 --> 11:32.525
You're looking for an
angle for your client.

11:32.527 --> 11:34.176
This is no angle.

11:34.178 --> 11:35.177
All right?

11:35.179 --> 11:36.946
This is for me. For me.

11:36.948 --> 11:37.847
It's a freebie.

11:37.849 --> 11:39.615
"Freebie""

11:39.617 --> 11:41.951
From a wiseguy doing
life in Sing Sing?

11:41.953 --> 11:43.035
It happens.

11:43.037 --> 11:45.321
Why are you looking
a gift horse in the mouth?

11:45.323 --> 11:46.456
Could be a
Trojan horse.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.124
How do I know
it's not a setup?

11:48.126 --> 11:51.077
Because if it was,
you know where to find me.

11:52.963 --> 11:56.048
And you can be more dangerous
than the guys I represent.

11:56.050 --> 11:58.868
You got the toughest mob
in the world, Frank.

11:58.870 --> 11:59.836
You're the law.

11:59.838 --> 12:02.872
Right this way.

12:02.874 --> 12:03.890
I'll catch up. Dad.

12:03.892 --> 12:05.258
Hey.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.845
My daughter in
a cigar bar.

12:08.847 --> 12:11.230
I'm meeting Judge Pearlman
to sign a warrant.

12:11.232 --> 12:12.398
Judge Pearlman.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.484
He would sign anything
for a box of Robustos.

12:14.486 --> 12:15.635
Oh, I'm sorry.
Erin...

12:15.637 --> 12:16.936
I'm familiar
with your work, Mr. Gallo.

12:16.938 --> 12:18.104
Erin Reagan.

12:18.106 --> 12:19.221
Hi.

12:19.223 --> 12:21.407
Listen, uh,
I have a client to meet.

12:21.409 --> 12:25.394
Frank, think about
what I said, okay?

12:26.230 --> 12:27.897
Please.

12:32.068 --> 12:33.669
What are you doing, Dad?

12:33.671 --> 12:36.088
Trying to figure out how I
got stuck with the check.

12:36.090 --> 12:37.406
That's not
what I'm talking about.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.125
The police commissioner
having lunch

12:39.127 --> 12:41.511
with the most famous
mob lawyer in the world?

12:41.513 --> 12:43.078
What is that about?

12:43.080 --> 12:44.931
Well, I may not
be a cop anymore,

12:44.933 --> 12:47.183
but I still have
friends in low places.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.944
Hey.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.095
Hey.
Hey.

13:00.097 --> 13:02.198
Oh, this is, uh,
my new partner.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.399
Kate Lansing.

13:03.401 --> 13:04.450
Hi.

13:04.452 --> 13:06.152
Hi, I'm-I'm Kate.

13:06.154 --> 13:07.620
So nice to meet you.

13:07.622 --> 13:09.271
Nice to meet you.

13:09.273 --> 13:10.601
You, uh, got any word
on Michael Reade?

13:10.626 --> 13:11.124
Yeah.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.625
He died.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.462
Did he say anything to anyone
about what happened?

13:16.464 --> 13:20.466
Um... no.

13:21.668 --> 13:24.837
Danny, could I talk to you
for a minute?

13:24.839 --> 13:26.172
Yeah, um...

13:26.174 --> 13:27.390
Excuse me.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.310
She's cute.

13:31.312 --> 13:33.563
Yeah, if you go
for that type.

13:34.765 --> 13:36.732
What is it?

13:36.734 --> 13:41.470
Listen, before he died
Reade talked to a priest.

13:41.472 --> 13:41.994
Uh-huh.

13:42.019 --> 13:44.377
This Father Quinn
from St. Angelus.

13:44.492 --> 13:45.908
Yeah.
I heard Reade say

13:45.910 --> 13:47.526
something to the priest.

13:47.528 --> 13:49.328
What was it?

13:49.330 --> 13:51.697
It was private, Danny,
I wasn't supposed to hear.

13:51.699 --> 13:53.199
Well, did he
say something

13:53.201 --> 13:54.700
that could help
me with my case?

13:54.702 --> 13:57.119
Well, it doesn't involve
his medical history,

13:57.121 --> 13:59.205
so there's no patient
confidentiality issues,

13:59.207 --> 14:02.875
but it was
his last confession, Danny.

14:02.877 --> 14:04.176
Well, I know
what that means,

14:04.178 --> 14:06.045
but do you want to protect
this guy's privacy

14:06.047 --> 14:08.264
or do you want to help me
find his killer, babe?

14:11.802 --> 14:16.639
Reade told the priest
that Tony was the killer.

14:16.641 --> 14:19.108
Tony-- did he, did
he say a last name?

14:19.110 --> 14:20.342
Not that I heard.

14:20.344 --> 14:22.111
He just said Tony.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.900
Okay, thank you.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.543
Make sure to say
a prayer to St. Michael.

14:37.545 --> 14:39.712
He has a soft spot
for you guys.

14:39.714 --> 14:41.247
I'm not so sure
about that.

14:41.249 --> 14:43.716
He was out to lunch last
few times I called on him.

14:45.419 --> 14:47.970
Detective Reagan,
I'm Father Quinn.

14:47.972 --> 14:49.138
What can I do for you?

14:49.140 --> 14:50.339
I understand

14:50.341 --> 14:53.009
you went to, uh, visit
Michael Reade this morning.

14:53.011 --> 14:55.878
I gave Michael Reade last
rites and a final confession.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.212
Yeah,

14:57.214 --> 14:59.432
and he gave you the first
name of the guy who shot him.

14:59.434 --> 15:01.267
Who told you that?

15:01.269 --> 15:02.384
So it's true?

15:02.386 --> 15:05.488
Confession is between
a priest and confessor.

15:05.490 --> 15:06.572
Yeah, I understand

15:06.574 --> 15:08.357
the sanctity of the
confessional, Father.

15:08.359 --> 15:10.443
I'm just trying to get
the guy's last name.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.245
I can't help you with that.

15:13.247 --> 15:14.580
You mean you won't
help me with that.

15:14.582 --> 15:18.734
My job was to listen
and to forgive.

15:18.736 --> 15:19.902
Okay,

15:19.904 --> 15:22.755
and my job is to get a
killer off the streets.

15:23.507 --> 15:26.241
Not for nothing,
the guy is dead.

15:26.243 --> 15:28.961
What does it matter if you
tell me what he said to you?

15:28.963 --> 15:30.179
I am protecting the seal

15:30.181 --> 15:32.264
of the confessional,
Detective Reagan.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.749
And if you
don't cooperate,

15:33.751 --> 15:35.685
you're also
protecting a killer.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.305
I'm afraid it's not
that simple.

15:53.781 --> 15:56.116
We arrested Michael Reade on
drug charges four years ago.

15:56.118 --> 15:57.417
He flipped right away,

15:57.419 --> 15:59.119
he testified against a
bunch of drug dealers.

15:59.121 --> 16:00.454
Right.
To be honest with you,

16:00.456 --> 16:02.889
I think he was relieved to
get out of the business.

16:02.891 --> 16:04.074
How so?

16:04.076 --> 16:06.093
He went to Hudson
Correctional, he got his GED,

16:06.095 --> 16:08.679
he was a peer counselor,
and then, when he got out,

16:08.681 --> 16:10.213
he opened up
that car dealership.

16:10.215 --> 16:11.765
What about the guys
he testified against?

16:11.767 --> 16:13.133
Any of them out yet?

16:14.185 --> 16:17.721
One died, one still
in prison, and one released.

16:17.723 --> 16:18.972
Okay, any of them named Tony?

16:18.974 --> 16:20.857
Anthony Kasper.

16:20.859 --> 16:22.643
Got paroled
around six months ago.

16:22.645 --> 16:25.028
File shows him working
as a telemarketer.

16:25.030 --> 16:25.979
I have an address.

16:25.981 --> 16:27.097
Great, thanks.

16:27.099 --> 16:28.899
How is Gramps doing, by the way?

16:31.654 --> 16:34.604
When I left him,
he was just going on and on

16:34.606 --> 16:36.940
about all the things that he
could have done differently.

16:36.942 --> 16:39.710
Right, so, in other words,
he's doing fine.

16:39.712 --> 16:41.628
He's fine.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.380
I'm just a little...
A little upset.

16:43.382 --> 16:44.548
Pissed off.

16:44.550 --> 16:45.549
Yeah.

16:45.551 --> 16:47.668
This guy is targeting
old people.

16:47.670 --> 16:48.802
I just wish I could...

16:48.804 --> 16:50.837
You wish you could
turn into Supergirl

16:50.839 --> 16:52.172
and just put the
entire family

16:52.174 --> 16:54.641
inside your little force
field and keep 'em safe.

16:54.643 --> 16:56.593
Actually it was
a time warp belt.

16:56.595 --> 16:58.261
Right.

16:58.263 --> 16:59.429
Thanks for the address.

16:59.431 --> 17:01.598
See you.

17:03.300 --> 17:08.070
Okay, his last hit was yesterday
at 1545 hours

17:08.073 --> 17:11.324
when he robbed his victim at
the Manhattan Mutual Bank ATM

17:11.326 --> 17:13.042
at 82 Fifth Avenue.

17:13.045 --> 17:16.530
The victim is Henry Reagan;
he's one of our own.

17:16.531 --> 17:18.498
He's not only
a retired cop

17:18.500 --> 17:20.650
and also a former PC
of the department,

17:20.652 --> 17:23.119
but he's also the grandfather
of Officer Reagan.

17:23.122 --> 17:25.172
But, because he's
a retired cop,

17:25.174 --> 17:27.624
we got a detailed
description on the guy.

17:27.626 --> 17:30.877
Here, Cruz, make yourself
useful and hand these out.

17:33.514 --> 17:37.134
This is a surveillance tape
of the attack.

17:52.683 --> 17:55.569
- What?
- Move.

17:55.571 --> 17:56.686
What do you mean?

17:56.688 --> 17:59.322
Hey, that's my money, punk.

17:59.324 --> 18:00.657
I will shoot your ass.

18:07.131 --> 18:09.049
You son of a...

18:09.051 --> 18:11.635
You son of a...
Aah!

18:16.924 --> 18:19.593
Come on.

18:24.432 --> 18:27.550
Capturing this guy
is our number one priority.

18:27.552 --> 18:30.821
Perp is armed--
looks like a .45--

18:30.823 --> 18:32.022
and as you can see in the video,

18:32.024 --> 18:34.407
he's escalated the violence
on his victims.

18:34.409 --> 18:37.027
Hit the street.

18:48.873 --> 18:50.624
Anthony Kasper.

18:51.677 --> 18:53.343
So you and Michael Reade
were friends, huh?

18:53.345 --> 18:54.461
Oh, we weren't friends;

18:54.463 --> 18:56.463
we just sold drugs
together back in the day.

18:56.465 --> 18:58.414
Oh, right,
back before he ratted you out.

18:58.416 --> 19:00.801
That's how you
cops work, right?

19:00.803 --> 19:02.352
Whoever cooperates
first wins?

19:02.354 --> 19:03.970
Not exactly.

19:03.972 --> 19:05.939
Mikey got the best deal.
Right,

19:05.941 --> 19:07.858
and I bet that pissed
you off, didn't it?

19:07.860 --> 19:09.559
Sure it did.
Uh-huh.

19:09.561 --> 19:10.727
So much so that

19:10.729 --> 19:12.279
you probably went
looking for revenge.

19:14.431 --> 19:17.200
I'm all about positive
energy these days.

19:19.654 --> 19:22.372
Where were you yesterday
at 2:00 p.m.?

19:22.374 --> 19:24.624
With a client.

19:25.426 --> 19:26.910
I'm a phone psychic.

19:26.912 --> 19:29.746
A phone psychic?

19:31.082 --> 19:32.833
Look at my hands.

19:33.668 --> 19:35.669
They're soft.

19:35.671 --> 19:36.920
Feel.

19:36.922 --> 19:38.255
Put your hands away.

19:38.257 --> 19:43.059
That's what I try to bring
into the world now-- softness.

19:43.061 --> 19:44.978
Yeah, I bet you do.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.313
Don't be a hater.

19:49.267 --> 19:51.601
So you were on the phone
with a client.

19:51.603 --> 19:55.155
Cindy from Mamaroneck.

19:55.157 --> 19:57.307
Having guy trouble.

19:57.309 --> 20:00.360
Going out with this
guy for five years.

20:00.362 --> 20:02.996
She wanted to know if he
was going to marry her.

20:04.999 --> 20:07.000
Doesn't take a psychic to
see where that's headed.

20:07.002 --> 20:09.319
Anyone who can vouch
for where you were?

20:09.321 --> 20:10.220
My boss.

20:10.222 --> 20:12.488
The company is Psychic Light

20:12.490 --> 20:14.674
out of Williamsburg.

20:15.626 --> 20:18.545
I'm their most requested reader.

20:18.547 --> 20:19.846
Can you think
of anybody else

20:19.848 --> 20:21.214
who would want
Michael Reade dead?

20:21.216 --> 20:24.100
Last I heard, he was
a used car salesman.

20:25.170 --> 20:27.670
Job like that,
probably people lining up.

20:27.672 --> 20:29.723
Okay, you know what?

20:29.725 --> 20:32.642
If you get any more
of your, uh, premonitions,

20:32.644 --> 20:35.678
why don't you do me a favor
and give us a call?

20:35.680 --> 20:37.113
Okay?

20:42.853 --> 20:45.906
John Spolarno-- head of
the Spolarno crime family--

20:45.908 --> 20:47.707
he's the target.

20:47.709 --> 20:50.327
Soldiers from the Rulanti
crime family are planning

20:50.329 --> 20:53.296
on hitting Spolarno
as he exits the restaurant.

20:53.298 --> 20:55.548
The Rulanti family has been on
our radar for two years now.

20:55.550 --> 20:57.000
And the feud between these
two families goes back

20:57.002 --> 20:58.134
at least ten years,

20:58.136 --> 20:59.586
and we've never been
close to a takedown

20:59.588 --> 21:01.554
until today.

21:01.556 --> 21:03.590
Usually they'll
use a .22 or .38--

21:03.592 --> 21:05.892
no splatter, easily disposable--

21:05.894 --> 21:08.178
so, in all likelihood,
this is a walk-up.

21:08.180 --> 21:09.212
We'll have four ESU

21:09.214 --> 21:11.181
inside the dry
cleaners next door,

21:11.183 --> 21:13.483
two inside the florist
across the street,

21:13.485 --> 21:16.519
and two nondescript vehicles--
one here, one here.

21:16.521 --> 21:17.437
We also have

21:17.439 --> 21:18.605
undercover in
the restaurant,

21:18.607 --> 21:20.190
so, as soon as Spolarno
starts for the door,

21:20.192 --> 21:21.358
they'll give
us the signal.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.777
We're going to need
to establish a perimeter

21:23.779 --> 21:25.245
so we know
who's entering and exiting

21:25.247 --> 21:26.863
the front and back
of the building.

21:26.865 --> 21:29.366
TARU is standing by
with a direct feed to our van,

21:29.368 --> 21:30.667
which is parked here,

21:30.669 --> 21:33.569
from the pole cameras set up
on the two corners.

21:33.571 --> 21:36.957
I want to reiterate that the
only people who know about this

21:36.959 --> 21:38.675
are sitting at this table.

21:38.677 --> 21:40.593
And it is mandatory

21:40.595 --> 21:42.629
that no one know the information
about this hit

21:42.631 --> 21:44.464
originated from
this office.

21:44.466 --> 21:45.682
What information?

21:45.684 --> 21:47.600
Once this goes down, the
press will be all over it.

21:47.602 --> 21:51.388
No one-- I repeat no one--
makes any comment

21:51.390 --> 21:53.606
unless it goes
through this office first.

21:53.608 --> 21:55.108
Lastly, this thing

21:55.110 --> 21:57.477
could turn out to be a setup.

21:57.479 --> 22:00.280
Keep that in mind
moving forward.

22:01.949 --> 22:04.117
Be careful.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.747
I have a question.

22:17.749 --> 22:20.467
You're the Police Commissioner
of New York City.

22:20.469 --> 22:24.054
So, do you want to tell me how
you know about a hit going down

22:24.056 --> 22:25.388
that no one else does?

22:25.390 --> 22:27.223
No.

22:27.225 --> 22:28.041
No what?

22:28.043 --> 22:30.593
No, I don't want to tell you.

22:42.073 --> 22:45.075
It's time
for our meal, man.

22:45.077 --> 22:46.443
You want to grab
a sandwich?

22:46.445 --> 22:48.278
No, I'll pass.

22:50.781 --> 22:53.816
Hey, I get that you really
want to get this guy, I do,

22:53.818 --> 22:56.703
but we passed these banks at
least a half a dozen times

22:56.705 --> 22:58.788
already today.
I need a break, man.

23:02.460 --> 23:05.328
12-David show us,
uh, 63.

23:05.330 --> 23:06.963
Copy that, 12-David.

23:06.965 --> 23:08.465
Yeah, right here's good.

23:10.251 --> 23:12.218
You sure you don't
want a sandwich?

23:12.220 --> 23:13.937
Yeah, I'm sure.

23:13.939 --> 23:16.106
All right.

23:25.800 --> 23:30.153
12-Edward, you've got
a 10-30 at the ATM at 2997 Madison.

23:33.408 --> 23:34.574
Come on.

23:34.576 --> 23:35.742
Hey, come on!

23:35.744 --> 23:37.660
12-Edward, you've got a 10-30

23:37.662 --> 23:39.462
at the ATM at 2997 Madison.

23:56.731 --> 23:58.264
Hey. What happened?
What happened?

23:58.266 --> 24:00.233
She got mugged.
The guy had a gun.

24:00.235 --> 24:01.317
Okay, you hold on, ma'am.

24:01.319 --> 24:02.385
I'm gonna get you
some help, okay?

24:02.387 --> 24:03.653
Anybody see him?
Yeah, yeah,

24:03.655 --> 24:05.188
black hoodie and jeans.
He ran down that way.

24:05.190 --> 24:06.389
Okay. Hey, call a bus!

24:06.391 --> 24:08.241
Call a bus!

24:15.833 --> 24:17.383
Hey!

24:17.385 --> 24:19.002
Police! Freeze!

24:26.094 --> 24:26.926
Hey!

24:26.928 --> 24:27.877
Stop!

24:27.879 --> 24:30.630
Police!

24:53.905 --> 24:58.241
DISPATCHER:
Shield 97651 to 12-David direct.

24:58.243 --> 25:01.461
Shield 97651
to 12-David direct!

25:03.914 --> 25:05.665
Stop!

25:05.667 --> 25:10.887
Shield 97651 to 12-David direct!

25:10.889 --> 25:13.473
Hey, stop!

25:14.308 --> 25:16.959
Police, don't move!

25:27.104 --> 25:28.655
Help!

25:28.657 --> 25:31.140
Help!

25:31.142 --> 25:32.642
Help!

25:32.644 --> 25:35.495
I don't want
to die!

25:35.497 --> 25:36.746
Help!

25:36.748 --> 25:38.314
I'm gonna fall!

25:38.316 --> 25:41.117
Help!

25:41.119 --> 25:43.670
Please!
I'm slipping!

25:44.255 --> 25:46.256
Help!

25:50.212 --> 25:52.762
Please! Help!

25:52.764 --> 25:54.097
Help!

25:54.099 --> 25:55.548
Help!

26:02.273 --> 26:04.440
Please!

26:05.943 --> 26:07.477
Please!

26:07.479 --> 26:09.112
How does it feel
to be the victim, huh?

26:09.114 --> 26:10.179
I'm sorry!

26:10.181 --> 26:12.398
Huh?!
Sorry! Pull me up!

26:12.400 --> 26:14.117
I'm sorry!

26:18.490 --> 26:20.623
Please, I'm sorry!

26:20.625 --> 26:23.359
Please, just...
pull me up!

26:23.361 --> 26:24.911
Please!

26:26.164 --> 26:28.131
Please!

26:32.586 --> 26:34.387
Get off me.

26:34.389 --> 26:35.388
Get off me.

26:35.390 --> 26:37.190
Get off me.

26:37.192 --> 26:40.310
On your stomach.
Hands behind your back.

26:41.312 --> 26:43.096
You were gonna...
you were gonna let me fall.

26:43.098 --> 26:44.097
But I didn't.

26:46.318 --> 26:48.551
12-David to Shield 97651.

26:48.553 --> 26:50.019
Go ahead, 12-David.

26:50.021 --> 26:52.188
I'm at 1100 Broadway.
I have one under.

26:52.190 --> 26:54.657
I repeat, I'm at 1100 Broadway.
I have one under.

26:54.659 --> 26:55.891
Copy that.
All right, let's go. Get up.

26:55.893 --> 26:59.162
You son of a bitch.
Get up!

27:08.270 --> 27:10.053
With no radio contact
whatsoever?

27:10.055 --> 27:11.939
Not to Central
or his partner.

27:11.941 --> 27:13.740
For how long?
20 minutes, sir.

27:13.742 --> 27:15.475
And how did his
C.O. handle it?

27:15.477 --> 27:16.576
He's gotten a command discipline

27:16.578 --> 27:18.745
with a three-day suspension.

27:18.747 --> 27:21.381
Hi, Dad.

27:22.317 --> 27:24.901
Well, by all means,
make yourself at home.

27:24.903 --> 27:26.853
I thought I'd surprise you.

27:26.855 --> 27:28.839
Getting to be a habit.

27:28.841 --> 27:31.008
We can finish up later.

27:33.561 --> 27:35.529
You have your official face on.

27:35.531 --> 27:38.348
So what's my surprise?

27:38.350 --> 27:40.901
Four organized crime members
of the Rulanti family

27:40.903 --> 27:43.070
were arrested today
for the attempted murder

27:43.072 --> 27:45.772
of the head of the
Spolarno family.

27:45.774 --> 27:47.107
And?

27:47.109 --> 27:50.644
And not one of the arresting
officers was able to tell me

27:50.646 --> 27:52.262
where the tip came from.

27:52.264 --> 27:54.031
Maybe they didn't know.

27:54.866 --> 27:56.599
Did it come from you?

27:57.485 --> 27:59.602
Is that why you were
having lunch with Gallo?

27:59.604 --> 28:01.571
That's part of my job.

28:01.573 --> 28:05.075
So keeping secrets
is part of your job?

28:06.244 --> 28:08.211
I'm gonna be prosecuting
this case.

28:08.213 --> 28:09.796
I need to know.

28:12.450 --> 28:14.418
Okay.

28:17.973 --> 28:19.789
Just this once,

28:19.791 --> 28:21.508
ask me everything,

28:21.510 --> 28:23.560
but it can't leave this room.

28:23.562 --> 28:26.629
The real reason
for the meeting with Gallo.

28:26.631 --> 28:29.632
His client is Carlos Antonari.

28:29.634 --> 28:33.636
He asked Gallo to relay the
information about the hit to me.

28:33.638 --> 28:34.654
Why you?

28:34.656 --> 28:37.441
I've always been fair with him.

28:37.443 --> 28:39.776
He's helped me with some cases
over the years.

28:39.778 --> 28:41.945
Did he ask for something
in exchange?

28:41.947 --> 28:43.613
He didn't ask
for anything,

28:43.615 --> 28:45.032
but I did a little digging.

28:45.034 --> 28:47.484
Beware of wise guys
bearing gifts.

28:49.420 --> 28:53.290
One of the men arrested
was a 19-year-old,

28:53.292 --> 28:55.125
Anthony Amico.

28:55.127 --> 28:57.794
The driver.
Gallo is listed as his counsel.

28:57.796 --> 28:59.796
He's Antonari's son.

29:00.664 --> 29:02.832
Changed his name.

29:04.519 --> 29:07.804
Why would he give a tip that
would have his own son arrested?

29:08.639 --> 29:10.640
My guess...

29:10.642 --> 29:13.310
in order to save him.

29:13.312 --> 29:14.694
Reade knew his killer.

29:14.696 --> 29:16.530
He was able
to identify him by name.

29:16.532 --> 29:18.422
How many Tonys did
he have in his phone?

29:18.447 --> 29:18.866
Four.

29:18.867 --> 29:20.346
Four. Any of them
have records?

29:20.347 --> 29:20.960
No.

29:20.985 --> 29:22.652
But the wife's
alibi checked out.

29:22.654 --> 29:24.170
She could have
hired someone.

29:24.172 --> 29:26.172
Well, it definitely feels more
professional than personal.

29:26.174 --> 29:27.574
Maybe he's back
in the drug business,

29:27.576 --> 29:28.991
using his car dealership
as a front.

29:28.993 --> 29:30.210
We could

29:30.212 --> 29:32.128
subpoena his business records,
see what comes out.

29:32.130 --> 29:34.330
I don't think we have enough
for a search warrant.

29:34.332 --> 29:35.164
Excuse me. Hey.

29:35.166 --> 29:36.850
Danny.
Yeah?

29:36.852 --> 29:38.668
Father Quinn has been shot.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.098
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you're a lucky man, Father.</i>

29:52.100 --> 29:54.484
The bullet missed your femoral
artery by about an inch,

29:54.486 --> 29:56.569
and if it hadn't,
you'd be dead.

29:56.571 --> 29:59.802
Maybe someone up there
is looking out for me.

29:59.803 --> 30:01.497
Yeah, well, someone down
here is trying to

30:01.498 --> 30:03.214
look out for you, too--
me.

30:03.829 --> 30:05.194
So I'm gonna ask you
one last time,

30:05.196 --> 30:06.746
do you know
who did this to you?

30:09.300 --> 30:11.718
Okay, do you know
why they did it to you?

30:15.222 --> 30:17.807
Look, what are you
protecting now?

30:17.809 --> 30:19.592
Just tell me.

30:22.396 --> 30:24.764
I'm sorry. I can't.

30:24.766 --> 30:26.766
No, you can but you won't.

30:26.768 --> 30:29.486
You're making it very difficult
for me to help you here.

30:29.488 --> 30:31.571
I know.

30:31.573 --> 30:35.241
And I appreciate the effort
you make, Detective Reagan.

30:35.243 --> 30:37.059
You're a good cop.

30:37.061 --> 30:38.328
I'm a good cop.

30:38.330 --> 30:40.530
Then why don't you
let me help you?

30:45.402 --> 30:48.404
You know what? Suit yourself.

30:51.842 --> 30:53.460
Thanks.

30:53.462 --> 30:55.077
I can't get this priest to talk.

30:55.079 --> 30:56.796
He's not cooperating.
We got nothing.

30:56.798 --> 30:58.381
Well, crime scene
found fingerprints

30:58.383 --> 30:59.916
on the shell casing
at the rectory,

30:59.918 --> 31:02.185
and they match the partial
prints from the Reade murder.

31:02.187 --> 31:03.753
Great. Did you run it?
Yes,

31:03.755 --> 31:06.306
they belong to Emilio Flores.
He's here on a work visa.

31:06.308 --> 31:09.108
Let's introduce him
to our legal system.

31:12.863 --> 31:14.764
Hey, what happened
out there?

31:14.766 --> 31:16.282
You left your partner,

31:16.284 --> 31:18.284
you didn't even answer up
on the radio.

31:18.286 --> 31:20.603
Yeah, I know.

31:21.438 --> 31:23.105
You didn't even
wait for backup.

31:23.107 --> 31:25.408
You could've gotten Cruz
jammed up big-time.

31:25.410 --> 31:28.110
And believe me, he tried
to cover your ass, but...

31:28.112 --> 31:29.963
you didn't even tell him
where you were going.

31:29.965 --> 31:31.548
Okay.

31:31.550 --> 31:34.617
As it is, the C.O.
is giving you a rip.

31:34.619 --> 31:36.085
Three days suspension.

31:36.087 --> 31:38.004
Fine, whatever.
"Whatever"?

31:38.006 --> 31:39.389
That's all you got to say?

31:39.391 --> 31:41.457
What do you want me
to say, Sarge?

31:41.459 --> 31:43.593
I want you to explain
to me how a cop

31:43.595 --> 31:45.345
who always goes
by the book

31:45.347 --> 31:47.347
suddenly decides
to go off on his own

31:47.349 --> 31:49.349
without telling anyone
where he's going

31:49.351 --> 31:50.934
in order to settle
a personal vendetta?

31:50.936 --> 31:52.652
I did my job today!
You were reckless!

31:52.654 --> 31:54.487
I got the guy! If I had
to do it over again,

31:54.489 --> 31:56.189
I would do the exact same thing!

31:57.474 --> 31:59.442
This guy was hanging off
the side of the building, Sarge,

31:59.444 --> 32:01.477
this guy who hit my grandfather,

32:01.479 --> 32:03.830
a man who's done nothing but
help people his entire life.

32:03.832 --> 32:05.815
And God help me,
I came this close

32:05.817 --> 32:07.333
to letting him take a nosedive.

32:08.619 --> 32:10.920
And part of me is still wishing
I hadn't reeled him in.

32:10.922 --> 32:13.089
Okay?

32:13.091 --> 32:15.842
I got the guy.

32:23.634 --> 32:25.768
Mr. Flores...

32:25.770 --> 32:28.771
you got a visa to come over here
and work at a car dealership

32:28.773 --> 32:30.607
owned by Michael Reade
and Adrian Baez.

32:30.609 --> 32:32.609
Yet, in the five years
you've been here,

32:32.611 --> 32:34.527
you've not sold
a single car.

32:34.529 --> 32:37.897
You want to tell us
what it is you really do?

32:37.899 --> 32:39.032
Just to let you know,

32:39.034 --> 32:40.650
I've advised my client
not to answer questions.

32:40.652 --> 32:41.951
And just to let you know,

32:41.953 --> 32:43.536
we're charging your
client with murder two

32:43.538 --> 32:45.405
and attempted murder--
you know what that means?

32:45.407 --> 32:47.373
About 25 years to life.

32:47.375 --> 32:49.709
Is that true?
He's just trying to scare you.

32:49.711 --> 32:52.996
- Well, it's working...
- Now, it could be that there are

32:52.998 --> 32:55.214
mitigating circumstances
that would make these charges

32:55.216 --> 32:58.217
less for you, but we need
to hear what that is.

32:58.219 --> 33:00.219
Okay, it's up to the D.A.
what the final charges are,

33:00.221 --> 33:02.171
- not the detectives.
- You want to trust her?

33:02.173 --> 33:04.007
You can go ahead,
but we have your fingerprints

33:04.009 --> 33:06.559
on shell casings that link you
to the murder of Michael Reade

33:06.561 --> 33:07.927
and the attempted murder
of Father Quinn.

33:07.929 --> 33:09.178
Yeah, and how
many jurors

33:09.180 --> 33:10.513
do you think
are gonna sympathize

33:10.515 --> 33:11.598
with a guy
who shot a priest?

33:11.600 --> 33:13.182
Look, he told me to
kill the priest,

33:13.184 --> 33:14.934
but I couldn't do it. That's why
I just shot him in the leg.

33:14.936 --> 33:16.218
Mr. Flores, just
stop right now.

33:16.220 --> 33:17.570
You're incriminating yourself.

33:17.572 --> 33:20.106
She is not the one looking
at 25 years to life, Mr. Flores.

33:20.108 --> 33:21.190
Mr. Flores?
Okay, Mr. Flores?

33:21.192 --> 33:22.992
Just shut up!

33:22.994 --> 33:24.527
Hey.

33:24.529 --> 33:26.779
Who was it
that wanted you to kill him?

33:37.791 --> 33:41.044
It was the same guy
that hired me to kill Reade.

33:42.296 --> 33:43.796
Mm.

33:43.798 --> 33:47.100
His business partner,
Tony Baez.

33:49.252 --> 33:51.104
You mean Adrian Baez?

33:51.106 --> 33:55.024
When he first came to this
country he wrote, "To N.Y."

33:55.026 --> 33:57.276
on all his luggage,
so he became Tony.

33:57.278 --> 33:59.261
I mean, to his close friends.

33:59.263 --> 34:01.864
Everybody else was just
too scared to joke with him.

34:01.866 --> 34:05.768
Okay, so,
why did he want Reade dead?

34:05.770 --> 34:08.103
Okay, look, detectives,

34:08.106 --> 34:11.440
my client is handing you
Mr. Baez on a silver platter.

34:11.442 --> 34:13.793
You need to give him
something in return.

34:13.795 --> 34:16.295
We don't need to do
a damn thing except listen

34:16.297 --> 34:18.831
to what he has to say.
Keep talking.

34:20.784 --> 34:21.951
Okay, don't keep talking.

34:21.953 --> 34:23.452
Reade...

34:23.454 --> 34:26.472
Reade was killed
because he found out

34:26.474 --> 34:28.757
Baez was running guns
through the dealership.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.393
He said he'd go to the
cops if he didn't stop.

34:31.396 --> 34:33.478
Hold on. Baez was running guns?
Where?

34:33.481 --> 34:35.063
Virginia and Pennsylvania.

34:35.065 --> 34:37.132
In the cars?

34:37.135 --> 34:39.301
They're all trapped out.

34:39.303 --> 34:40.987
When's the next shipment
of guns?

34:40.989 --> 34:42.989
Uh-uh.

34:42.991 --> 34:45.474
Hey.

34:45.476 --> 34:46.743
You do the right thing here,

34:46.745 --> 34:49.027
I promise I'll put in
a good word with the D.A.

34:59.957 --> 35:03.292
There's a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.844
That was nice work
you did the other day, Jamie,

35:19.846 --> 35:21.763
arresting the guy
who robbed Grandpa.

35:21.765 --> 35:24.399
It was something, all right.

35:24.401 --> 35:26.267
Congratulations, Uncle Jamie.
Thanks, bud.

35:26.269 --> 35:27.502
Did he have a gun?

35:27.504 --> 35:28.736
Yeah, he had a gun.

35:28.738 --> 35:30.155
Sweet.

35:30.157 --> 35:31.906
And I've got the bruises
to prove it.

35:31.908 --> 35:33.074
Well, I saw

35:33.076 --> 35:34.325
the surveillance
video, Gramps.

35:34.327 --> 35:35.577
You got in a pretty good
right hook yourself.

35:35.579 --> 35:36.995
Mm.
Hmm.

35:37.780 --> 35:39.581
Is he going
to do a lot of time?

35:39.583 --> 35:41.332
Well, he's got
a long record.

35:41.334 --> 35:43.084
I'm guessing
five to 15.

35:43.086 --> 35:44.869
You made sure I get to testify?

35:44.871 --> 35:46.871
You are going
to be my star witness.

35:46.873 --> 35:48.656
And I don't have to worry
about you backing down

35:48.658 --> 35:49.924
or getting intimidated.

35:49.926 --> 35:51.492
No, but you might
have to worry

35:51.494 --> 35:53.011
about Gramps
intimidating the perp.

35:53.013 --> 35:55.096
Yeah.
Ooh, I wish I could have

35:55.098 --> 35:56.214
got a clean shot at him.

35:56.216 --> 35:59.184
I think somebody already did.

36:00.853 --> 36:02.971
I'll clear.

36:19.856 --> 36:22.040
Hey, cowboy.

36:22.925 --> 36:25.126
C.O. gave me three days.

36:25.128 --> 36:27.579
I'll gladly take that
for doing what I did.

36:27.581 --> 36:29.214
I would have given you a week.

36:30.099 --> 36:31.499
What were you thinking?

36:31.501 --> 36:33.367
I was thinking I'd get the guy

36:33.369 --> 36:34.586
who went after my grandfather.

36:34.588 --> 36:35.870
That's what I was thinking.

36:35.872 --> 36:37.589
But you're a New York City cop.

36:37.591 --> 36:39.807
You don't get
to go medieval on anybody.

36:39.809 --> 36:42.093
I don't see you getting
on Danny's case

36:42.095 --> 36:44.012
when he bends the rules.

36:45.097 --> 36:47.315
How would you know?

36:48.651 --> 36:50.735
I admit
that I should have radioed in,

36:50.737 --> 36:52.887
but if I hadn't gone
after that guy,

36:52.889 --> 36:54.188
he would have gotten away.

36:54.190 --> 36:56.441
Would he now?

36:56.443 --> 37:00.528
I saw an opportunity,
and I took it.

37:00.530 --> 37:02.947
Now I'm being punished
for getting justice.

37:02.949 --> 37:04.949
You weren't looking for justice.

37:04.951 --> 37:07.118
You were looking for vengeance.

37:08.454 --> 37:11.256
I think you know the difference.

37:21.267 --> 37:23.417
We got an eyeball
on the car lot.

37:23.419 --> 37:25.687
Let us know ASAP
when you got a visual.

37:25.689 --> 37:26.754
We're at the ready.

37:26.756 --> 37:28.806
Copy that.

37:36.949 --> 37:40.785
Okay, we got a visual
on the car transporter.

37:40.787 --> 37:43.071
- We're on the move.
- We're moving in.

37:46.959 --> 37:49.160
You ready?
Yup.

38:07.514 --> 38:09.647
Okay, well, this has got
to go to Connecticut.

38:09.649 --> 38:11.099
How we gonna do that?

38:11.934 --> 38:15.520
Oh, where's our backup?

38:15.522 --> 38:17.405
We got to get another truck.
Come on, we got to move now.

38:17.407 --> 38:18.606
Right away.

38:19.859 --> 38:21.275
They're going for the door.
Come on.

38:22.812 --> 38:24.746
- Police!
- Police! Get your hands up!

38:27.200 --> 38:28.666
Get your hands where
we can see 'em. - Don't move!

38:29.602 --> 38:31.619
Nice and slow.

38:32.504 --> 38:33.838
Get your hands up.

39:10.242 --> 39:12.526
Baez is on the move.
I got to go after him.

39:12.528 --> 39:13.795
I'll cover you.
All right.

39:13.797 --> 39:14.912
Guys, we're gonna cover him.
He's going in.

39:14.914 --> 39:16.164
Got it.

39:16.166 --> 39:17.482
Go!

40:25.951 --> 40:28.619
This one illegal?

40:28.621 --> 40:31.622
Absolutely.
It's one of Fidel's favorites.

40:32.774 --> 40:35.493
Isn't it a
conflict of interest

40:35.495 --> 40:38.045
for you to represent
a kid who was arrested

40:38.047 --> 40:39.547
on a tip that
you supplied?

40:39.549 --> 40:41.782
He's a family friend.

40:41.784 --> 40:43.551
Oh, yeah? Whose family?

40:44.971 --> 40:46.921
Come on, Frank.

40:46.923 --> 40:49.056
He didn't know anything
about the hit.

40:49.058 --> 40:50.758
He's 19,
he's never been arrested.

40:50.760 --> 40:51.959
He got swept up.

40:51.961 --> 40:55.813
I hope you're not looking
for a favor, Angelo.

40:55.815 --> 40:57.148
Just a little mercy.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.683
He grew up without a father.

40:58.685 --> 41:01.602
He deserves a break,
you know, a second chance.

41:01.604 --> 41:03.654
That's why I recommended
the Shock program.

41:03.656 --> 41:06.473
Boot camp for first offenders,
high success rate.

41:06.475 --> 41:08.576
He'll do a
year, minimum.

41:08.578 --> 41:10.578
A year?

41:10.580 --> 41:12.646
Any wiggle room there?

41:12.648 --> 41:15.500
Hard to learn from your mistakes
without consequences.

41:18.288 --> 41:21.655
All right. Well... let's eat.

41:21.657 --> 41:24.509
They got some nice stone crab
sent up from Miami.

41:24.511 --> 41:26.377
I asked her to save us some.

41:26.379 --> 41:28.012
Sounds good to me.

41:28.014 --> 41:30.164
Thing about stone crabs?

41:30.166 --> 41:32.517
You got to take them
one claw at a time

41:32.519 --> 41:35.386
so the crab can keep moving
around doing his crab business

41:35.388 --> 41:36.637
while it grows back.

41:36.639 --> 41:38.689
Kind of like your law practice.

41:39.909 --> 41:41.392
That's not nice, Frankie.

41:42.779 --> 41:44.612
That's very good.
You're a funny guy.

41:48.901 --> 41:51.319
"Revenge is an act of passion.

41:51.321 --> 41:53.821
Vengeance of justice."

41:53.823 --> 41:55.540
Samuel Johnson.

41:55.542 --> 41:58.209
Said it better than me.

41:58.211 --> 42:00.995
There's another saying.

42:00.997 --> 42:03.748
If you're looking for vengeance,
you better dig two graves--

42:03.750 --> 42:06.700
one for your enemy,
one for yourself.

42:06.702 --> 42:08.786
Still, in the same
situation, I think

42:08.788 --> 42:10.721
both you guys would've done
the exact same thing I did.

42:10.723 --> 42:12.557
No way.

42:12.559 --> 42:13.808
I don't know about Francis.

42:13.810 --> 42:17.044
I would've let
the scumbag fall.

42:18.564 --> 42:21.432
Who wants a cannoli?

42:21.434 --> 42:22.549
Hey.

42:22.551 --> 42:23.884
Hi there.

42:23.886 --> 42:26.070
Or a little Scotch for those
watching their waistlines.

42:26.072 --> 42:27.104
What's going on?

42:27.106 --> 42:28.172
Got out of work early.

42:28.174 --> 42:29.657
Yeah. Linda and
the boys went out,

42:29.659 --> 42:30.891
so, we figured
we'd come over

42:30.893 --> 42:32.577
and watch a movie
or something.

42:32.579 --> 42:34.195
John Wayne marathon at 9:00.

42:34.197 --> 42:37.365
Or we could watch
this great double bill.

42:37.367 --> 42:39.083
<i>Death Wish</i> and <i>Walking Tall.</i>

42:43.238 --> 42:46.007
So, are we drinking to remember,
or drinking to forget?

42:46.009 --> 42:48.342
Both.
Here you go.

42:48.344 --> 42:49.510
You're getting more and more

42:49.512 --> 42:51.345
like your older brother
every day, kid.

42:51.347 --> 42:52.513
It's awfully crowded

42:52.515 --> 42:53.914
in here for a Monday,
don't you think?

42:53.916 --> 42:56.050
Well, we can always
send 'em packing.

42:58.086 --> 43:02.473
Nah. I never like to see a good
bottle of Scotch go to waste.

43:02.475 --> 43:04.025
I'll get the glasses.

43:04.027 --> 43:06.060
All right.

43:09.448 --> 43:11.365
Hey.
