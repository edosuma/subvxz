<i>Denial's underrated.</i>

00:20.478 --> 00:23.231
<i>It's highly effective,</i>

00:26.151 --> 00:27.610

-[John B] I'm sorry.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.587
Uh... I'm just dropping off
some scuba gear.

01:28.713 --> 01:31.216
What are-- what are you doing... here?

01:33.510 --> 01:34.552
It's our boat.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.930
It's also the only place
with air conditioning.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.098
Right.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.809
Did you, um... top up the tanks?

01:40.892 --> 01:42.227
Uh...

01:42.977 --> 01:47.774
No. No, power's down, so the compressors
were off. [clears throat]

01:47.857 --> 01:51.319
So, you're sneaking onto our boat
at 5:00 a.m. with empty tanks?

01:53.196 --> 01:54.614
I'll make sure to tell Ward.

01:56.574 --> 01:57.826
Okay. Okay.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.036
Cool. Cool.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.123
Just drop these off.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.667
Yeah, yeah,
the middle of the room is fine.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.002
Yeah, this is pretty much
what he told me to do.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.754
[Sarah] Bye.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.800
Actually, you know, what-- what exactly
were you gonna tell your dad? [chuckles]

02:15.260 --> 02:18.012
Nothing much.
Just that you poached our scuba gear.

02:18.096 --> 02:21.724
Okay, fuck. I borrowed it for a few hours.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.561
Okay? And then I brought it back intact
and unharmed.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.854
Minus air.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.149
Look, please don't tell him.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.234
-Okay? He'll fire me.
-[Sarah] What are you gonna do?

02:31.818 --> 02:32.777
Pull a gun on me?

02:32.861 --> 02:35.655
-I didn't know JJ would do that.
-[Sarah] That's convenient to believe.

02:35.738 --> 02:36.573
[scoffs]

02:37.699 --> 02:39.200
Maybe you should get better friends.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.411
Well, maybe you should get
a better boyfriend.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.497
[scoffs] Like one who doesn't poach?

02:46.124 --> 02:48.835
Look, please, just don't tell him.

02:48.918 --> 02:49.919
-Okay?
-[Sarah] Relax.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.672
I'm not gonna tell him anything.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.300
Your secret's safe with me, John B.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.305
Okay, you can leave now.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.390
Right. Yeah. Uh...

03:03.516 --> 03:06.269
-I'll leave-- I'll leave that right there.
-[Sarah] Bye.

-[laughs] Gotcha, slick.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.379
[laughing]

03:34.214 --> 03:36.841
You should have seen your face.
Your face was like...

03:37.300 --> 03:40.303
[JJ] I'm just saying, I don't understand
why you don't at least try with Kiara.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.055
She clearly likes you.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.390
-She's like, "Oh, John B."
-Is that what she does?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.893
[JJ] She's sketching about you diving,
then she kissed you.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.353
She kissed me on the cheek.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.939
-It's not like we were makin' out.
-Low-hanging fruit, bro.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.523
Don't pretend you don't notice.

03:52.607 --> 03:53.524
I see it in your eyes.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.777
You're like, "I kinda like that,"
and you start blushing.

03:55.860 --> 03:56.986
-[John B] I blush?
-Yeah.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.446
-[John B] Really?
-[JJ] Yeah.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.199
-Hey, don't--
-I was just looking at it.

04:02.492 --> 04:06.496
I gotta admit, your father's compass
in Scooter's boat, that's freaky.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.791
Yeah. That's why we're going to talk
to Ms. Lana, figure this whole thing out.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.501
I'm sure she would just love
to talk to us.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.087

just drowned or anything.

-[girl] Mm-hm.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.588
Okay, can you tell me what she looks like?

07:43.671 --> 07:45.173
She has a trunk and blue ears.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.593
-Okay. I'm gonna get her for you.
-[girl] Be careful of electricity.

Sarah, get down now!

I got this.

You're gonna get electrocuted!
Get down!

-[boy] She wants attention.
-[Rose] You kidding me? Get--

-Oh my... No.
-[Topper] Sarah, that's not funny.

-Holy shit!

-For the love of God.

-Absolute sucker.
-[boy] Oh, my God.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.949
[Sarah] Topper, you should see your face.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.910
Yeah. Okay, yeah, I'm sorry that I care.
All right, guilty.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.955
Congrats, pussy,
you're officially her bitch.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.206
-[laughing]
-[Rafe] All right.

09:00.289 --> 09:03.376
Officially, did you know that?
You're officially her bitch, all right?

09:04.710 --> 09:06.879
[Wheezie]
You're worried, like a normal person.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.381
I mean, she could have died.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.299
She does scary stuff like that
all the time.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.636
If you say something, it'll be like
you're trying to tell her what to do,

09:13.719 --> 09:14.845
and you'll end up like Denny.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.432
Wait, Denny? What are you talking about?
What happened with Denny?

09:18.516 --> 09:20.851
She cheated on him.
And the guy before that.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.562
You know what that means?

09:22.645 --> 09:24.605
You're next. You're the next sucker up.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.525
You should have seen her flirting
with John B this morning.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.319
John-- John B?
The guy that works on the boat?

09:30.403 --> 09:31.487
-[Wheezie] Mm-hm.
-[scoffs]

09:31.571 --> 09:34.448
She caught him stealing stuff
off the boat.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.658
Did she tell anybody?

09:35.741 --> 09:38.869
Nope. She was all,
"John B, what are you doing here?"

09:38.953 --> 09:40.204
[Sarah] What's up, Top?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.416
-Hey, Sneezie.
-That's not my name.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.667
-Ow.
-No way.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.336
Hey, been looking all over for you.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.423
Ugh. God.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.468
-And we were right outside like this.
-[rooster crowing]

09:54.552 --> 09:57.305
And all we hear is just, "Bam! Bam! Bam!"

09:57.388 --> 09:59.640
Knocking paint off the wall, G!
From the inside.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.018
All right?
And I'm just looking at him, like--

10:02.101 --> 10:03.644
Wait, first off, look at this shit.

10:03.728 --> 10:04.812
-Look at it.
-The house.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.023
-That's dandruff, disgusting.
-[Pope] Okay, thank you.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.733
Look at all that. All right?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.276
That's paint.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.113
At that point, I was just, like...
I'm waiting for death.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.949
Oh, okay, so you saw the guys
that shot at us, right?

10:17.033 --> 10:19.160
-Yeah.
-Did you get a good description of them?

10:19.243 --> 10:20.661
-What did they look like?
-Anything.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.663
[Pope] Anything we can bring
to a police report?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.540
-Yeah.
-Burly.

10:25.791 --> 10:26.834
-Burly?
-[JJ] Yeah.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.836
-You know, like--
-[Kie] That's not very helpful.

10:28.919 --> 10:31.505
[JJ] Okay, well, no, like the type of guy
at my dad's garage.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.508
I mean, you guys know he made
cargo hides for drug smugglers.

10:34.592 --> 10:38.012
-Yeah. Yes. No, we know.
-[JJ] I can tell you with full confidence,

10:38.095 --> 10:40.556
these boys, these killers...

10:44.226 --> 10:45.311
they're square groupers.

10:46.103 --> 10:49.106
They're square groupers,
like narco square grouper?

10:49.190 --> 10:51.859
-Like Pablo Escobar square grouper?
-Yeah, man.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.986
You guys,
not everything is a kingpin movie.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.863
[Pope] What does this square grouper
look like?

10:55.946 --> 10:57.531
-Specifically?
-[JJ] You weren't there.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.575
-You don't know what to look for.
-[JJ] Dude!

10:59.659 --> 11:02.036
I wasn't taking
little mental Polaroids the entire time.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.038
I was under duress, okay?

11:04.872 --> 11:05.873
But I can tell you...

11:08.584 --> 11:11.087
I can tell you by the way
that Ms. Lana was screaming...

11:11.921 --> 11:14.882
that these guys are serious,
serious <i>hombres,</i> man.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.346
It's a heavy vibe right now, okay?

11:20.429 --> 11:22.181
I'm not liking this very much.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.600
-Why do they want the compass?
-[Pope] It's a piece of shit.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.269
You couldn't pawn it off for five bucks
if you wanted to.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.648
-No offense. I know it's in your family--
-The office.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.066
[Pope] What?

11:33.275 --> 11:35.027
My dad. My dad's office.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.822
He always kept the office locked
because he was worried about

11:37.905 --> 11:40.241
his competitors stealing
his Royal Merchant research.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.493
We used to laugh at him
like he was gonna find it.

11:42.576 --> 11:47.331
But now that he's gone, I've just kinda...
I just left it as he kept it.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.667
Yeah, for when he gets back.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.128
[John B] Yeah.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.386
[Pope] I've slept over here
like 600 times,

12:00.469 --> 12:03.097
-and I've never seen this door opened.
-[Kie] Mm.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.018
Here, look.
This is the original owner, right here.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.646
Okay. Robert Q. Routledge,

12:10.730 --> 12:14.859
1880 to 1920.
There's the lucky compass, right there.

12:14.942 --> 12:18.612
Actually, um...
he was shot after he bought it.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.072
[rooster crowing]

12:20.156 --> 12:22.324
[John B] Then the compass was shipped back
to Henry.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.286
He was killed in a crop-dusting accident
when he had the compass.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.580
After he died,
the compass was given to Stephen.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.999
Stephen had the compass with him
when he died in Vietnam.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.917
[JJ] Let me guess,
he died in action, right?

12:32.001 --> 12:32.960
[John B] Sort of.

12:33.043 --> 12:37.256
Uh, a-actually, he was killed
by a banana truck. In-- in country.

12:37.339 --> 12:41.677
Anyways, after that, Stephen passed
the compass down to him, my dad.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.388
Hm. Sounds like there's
a reoccurring theme here.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.932
-Yeah, you have a death compass.
-[John B] I do not.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.976
-You have a death compass.
-[JJ] Get rid of it.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.686
It's cursed, and made its way back to you.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.606
Look, my dad used to talk about
this compartment in here.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.441
Soldiers used to hide secret notes.

13:00.696 --> 13:03.073
-[Kie] What's that?
-[John B] That wasn't there before.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.036
-This is my dad's handwriting.
-How can you know that?

13:07.119 --> 13:09.413
Because he does these weird Rs with the--
See it?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.539
[JJ] Can I see it?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.710
"Red-- Rout--"

13:14.794 --> 13:16.712
-No, I think that's an A.
-[Kie] It says Redfield.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.465
-Right.
-[Kie] Okay, well, what's Redfield?

13:19.548 --> 13:21.217
[Pope] The most common name
in the county.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.635
Oh, maybe-- maybe it's a clue.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.804
-Maybe it's a clue to where he's hiding.
-[JJ] Okay...

13:24.887 --> 13:26.222
A clue? Come on, that's--

13:26.305 --> 13:27.556
-[rooster crows]
-[clears throat]

13:28.432 --> 13:30.267
But if it is a clue,
maybe it's an anagram?

13:30.351 --> 13:32.603
Yes. Perfect. Anagram. You need paper.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.646
-Okay.
-Here you go.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.732
How can you concentrate with that thing
crowing at you?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.984
-[John B] JJ loves the rooster.
-I love the rooster.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.611
[Pope] Let me think.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.489
-[Kie] Seriously, think.
-[Pope] Dedfiel. Colors-- That's stupid.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.241
-What about Ritalin?
-[Kie] Um...

13:45.324 --> 13:48.369
-Dreidel? Fiddler?
-[Pope] Let's stick with what we're....

13:48.452 --> 13:50.704
-Defile. Does that mean anything to you?
-Guys.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.165
-[Kie] You're missing a letter.
-Guys! Somebody's here.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.589
-[Kie] Guys, guys, is that them?
-No.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.758
-Is that them?
-[Pope] This is suboptimal.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.926
John B, I told you.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.011
-Why does it always--
-JJ! Hey, look at me.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.306
-Where's the gun?
-Gun? I, uh, I can't--

14:09.390 --> 14:11.767
Now you don't have the gun,
the one time we need the gun?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.686
-It was in my backpack, and then I--
-Backpack--

14:13.769 --> 14:15.312
-On the porch.
-It's on the porch.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.772
-It's--
-[John B] Go, go.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.277
[man 1] John Routledge!

14:21.360 --> 14:23.863
-[Kie] Guys!
-[man 1] Come on out now! Fuck--

14:23.946 --> 14:25.823
-Where's the compass?
-[John B] Where's the gun?

14:25.906 --> 14:28.409
-They're on the front porch, guys.
-[man 2] Get out here!

14:28.492 --> 14:29.493
[man 1] Routledge!

14:30.536 --> 14:31.912
Where you at, boy?

14:31.996 --> 14:33.038
[Kie] We gotta leave!

14:33.122 --> 14:34.915
-Guys, window. Window.
-[glass smashing]

14:36.125 --> 14:37.751
-[Kie] Hurry.
-[man 2] Sack this place!

14:38.586 --> 14:39.587
[grunts]

14:39.670 --> 14:41.797
What-- what's happening?
Why is it taking so long?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.341
-It's painted shut, okay?
-[man 1] I'll check the kitchen.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.803
Routledge!

14:47.887 --> 14:48.721
[grunting]

14:48.804 --> 14:50.681
Okay, guys. Guys. Here, I got it.

14:50.764 --> 14:52.308
[man 1] Where the hell's that compass?

14:52.391 --> 14:53.851
Hey, check the back room.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.644
-[crashing]
-[man 1 yells]

14:55.728 --> 14:57.855
-[JJ] Come on.
-[Kie] I'm going as fast as I can.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.398
-Shh...
-Be quiet.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.483
-[man 1 yelling]
-[crashing]

15:02.234 --> 15:03.819
[man 2] You better not be in there!

15:04.904 --> 15:06.196
-[grunts]
-[door rattling]

15:10.451 --> 15:11.410
[Kie gasps]

15:11.493 --> 15:12.453
[gun cocks]

15:15.873 --> 15:17.708
[rooster crowing]

15:51.325 --> 15:53.953
[man 2] Ratter, check out
these blueprints of the ship.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.169
The mother lode.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.839
[chickens clucking]

16:08.425 --> 16:09.927
[rooster crowing]

16:10.010 --> 16:11.887
Do something, Pope. Shut him up.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.224
-[Pope] What do you want me to do?
-Pet it, or talk to it. I don't know.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.308
[chickens clucking]

16:22.648 --> 16:24.733
[clucking continues]

16:26.026 --> 16:27.152
[Pope] You do something.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.619
[clucking continues]

16:35.703 --> 16:36.829
[JJ grunts]

16:41.500 --> 16:42.668
[sobs]

16:52.177 --> 16:54.972
[man 2] Ratter! What the hell
are you doin'? Let's go.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.477
-[engine starts]
-[Kie sobbing]

17:08.610 --> 17:10.612
[breathing heavily]

17:18.829 --> 17:20.581
[power tools whirring]

17:28.464 --> 17:30.299
[Sarah]
You're lookin' a little unstable there.

17:30.382 --> 17:35.512
[Topper sighs] All right.
It's worth it for this view right here.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.223
-Oh, you mean, that?
-Oh, you too. No, you too.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.434
[chuckles]

17:40.517 --> 17:41.852
[laughs]

17:42.394 --> 17:43.353
Oh, man.

17:48.942 --> 17:49.777
Hey, uh...

17:51.820 --> 17:55.240
I heard you had a Pogue
kinda sneakin' around here this mornin'.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.035
Who told you that?

17:58.869 --> 18:01.330
Oh, it doesn't matter. Um...

18:01.413 --> 18:04.208
Yeah.
It's just like, you gotta be careful.

18:04.291 --> 18:08.003
These Pogues are all just lowlifes,
I mean...

18:09.838 --> 18:11.840
Don't say that, Topper.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.842
-You don't know them.
-Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.429
I'm sorry that, uh...
I'm sorry that they put a gun to my head.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.306
[chuckles]

18:19.389 --> 18:21.225
-You know what that feels like?
-No, I don't.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.018
-But to be fair, Topper...
-They'e dangerous.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.103
To be fair,

18:24.686 --> 18:26.522
-you threw the first punch.
-Oh.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.732
That's my bad.
That's my-- I deserved that.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.484
-I didn't say that.
-Shit.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.194
You realize
I'm just trying to protect you?

18:32.277 --> 18:34.196
I know, and I appreciate that.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.365
-I get it.
-I don't think you're gettin' it.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.576
-You just gonna go hang out with them?
-Topper, John B works here.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.537
-What do you want me to do?
-John B. Yeah.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.414
-What do you expect from me? Hand signals?
-I don't know.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.834
I'm sorry that I just--
just care about you.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.506
Yeah, just-- you're just gonna walk away.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.716
[Sarah] Yeah, I am.
I can't deal with this.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.059
[Ward] Hey, Top.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.395
How'd your family come through?
Is the house okay?

19:06.478 --> 19:08.021
[Topper] Yeah, we're doing all right.

19:08.105 --> 19:11.150
We, you know, had a few leaks,
had a tree come close to the house,

19:11.233 --> 19:12.526
but, yeah, we're doing all right.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.027
-Glad to hear it.
-[Topper] Yeah.

19:14.111 --> 19:18.157
Hey, listen, what's this I hear about
a, uh... kid with a gun at the Point?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.950
-Did that happen?
-Yeah. Yes, sir.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.827
-[Ward] My God.
-You know how those Pogues are.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.453
You just gotta watch 'em.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.665
-[Ward] Yeah.
-Hey, sir, sir. Actually, one of the, um--

19:26.748 --> 19:30.377
I just want to say, one of these kids
you gotta watch for, he works for you.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.172
-What are you talking about?
-It's-- it's that John B kid.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.841
What ab--
He's not the one that had the gun, is he?

19:35.924 --> 19:37.676
[Topper] No, sir, no. It's just, um...

19:37.759 --> 19:40.429
I heard
he likes to kinda help himself to gear.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.973
-So, I'm just--
-What gear, Topper?

19:43.056 --> 19:44.641
I don't want to be tellin' stories, sir.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.477
It's just, you got a lot of nice things
layin' around.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.730
I'd just make sure
everything's nailed down.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.733
-Good to see you, Mr. Cameron.
-Yeah.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.531
[John B] I mean, it's obvious, right?

20:00.616 --> 20:03.869
A family heirloom.
What better place to hide a message?

20:03.952 --> 20:05.996
He had to know
it was gonna get back to me, right?

20:06.079 --> 20:08.665
-Yeah. It's possible.
-[Pope] It could also be possible

20:08.749 --> 20:11.084
that you're concocting wild theories
to help,

20:11.793 --> 20:14.379
-you know, deal with your sad feels.
-Pope?

20:14.463 --> 20:16.590
[JJ] Bro, you know
how I process my sad feels.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.175
Dank nugs and the stickiest of ickies,

20:18.258 --> 20:20.385
-that's how I do it.
-I'm not concocting, okay?

20:20.469 --> 20:22.429
My dad's trying to give me a message.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.349
If it helps you believe, John B.

20:25.432 --> 20:28.227
[John B] Look, I-I don't need
a therapy session, okay?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.020
Look, I'm not trippin' out.

20:30.103 --> 20:33.732
-It's okay to trip, bro, but--
-Look, my-- my dad is missing, okay?

20:35.943 --> 20:36.860
Missing.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.781
You don't know what it's like to have
the person closest to you vanish

20:41.531 --> 20:43.242
and then have no idea what happened.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.995
Just wake up every morning wondering.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.249
It's been almost a year.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.336
Hey, he could have been kidnapped.
That's definitely a possibility.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.881
Yeah, could be in a Soviet sub
getting interrogated by the KGB somewhere.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.092
Absolutely. Uh... or Atlantis.

21:00.175 --> 21:03.262
JJ. Look,
what do you think the message is?

21:03.762 --> 21:04.846
Redfield.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.393
Redfield Lighthouse.
That's my dad's favorite place.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.032
Right. You're gonna post up
and look out for bogeys, okay?

21:24.116 --> 21:25.784
Wait... Why me?

21:26.201 --> 21:27.828
-Because you're not coming.
-Why?

21:28.245 --> 21:30.330
There are independent
and dependent variables.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.416
You're independent.
We don't know what you'll do.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.251
-Shut up!
-[John B] Listen to me for a second.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.295
Pope, you stand look out with JJ. Okay?

21:36.378 --> 21:38.171
If we get split up,
we meet back at JJ's house.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.172
Great.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.260
I'm gonna work on
my merit scholarship essay,

21:43.343 --> 21:45.137
and I'm trying to keep felonies
to a minimum.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.097
All right, would you just shut up already?

21:51.435 --> 21:53.562
Remind me what we're looking for again.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.565
[John B] We'll know it when we see it.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.066
Okay.

22:28.764 --> 22:29.681
Nobody home.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.189
Um... we're here for the lighthouse.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.566
[man] The lighthouse is closed.

22:39.941 --> 22:40.817
Um...

22:44.029 --> 22:47.282
[John B] Actually, we... we aren't here
about the lighthouse.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.077
We're here about the, uh...

22:52.621 --> 22:53.747
the Royal Merchant.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.882
Then you came to the right place.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.303
I know more... Watch your step here.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.932
...about the Royal Merchant
than anyone else in Kildare County.

23:13.016 --> 23:14.017
Holy shit.

23:14.559 --> 23:15.560
C'mon.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.566
Now, the Merchant disappeared

23:22.067 --> 23:25.779
in the graveyard of the Atlantic in 1829.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.408
-With four hundred million.
-[man] Correct.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.536
You're a bit of
a Merchanteer yourself, huh?

23:34.329 --> 23:36.998
Uh... somethin' like that.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.000
Well, follow me.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.546
I wanna show you somethin'. [chuckles]

23:43.547 --> 23:45.674
I've been workin' 30 years up here.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.468
The view's never changed
till two days ago.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.012
The Point's almost gone.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.682
One more storm like that,
it'll take the lighthouse.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.600
I'll go with her.

23:57.310 --> 24:00.856
Now, the trick to knowin'
where the Merchant is...

24:01.356 --> 24:03.942
is knowin' whether she was
on the north end

24:04.025 --> 24:06.778
or the south end of the eye of the storm.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.574
Now, most experts believe
that she was on the south end.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.409
Now, she's on the south end,

24:12.909 --> 24:16.788
the bands from the hurricane
would have pushed her back out to sea.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.291
But I don't believe that.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.209
Uh-uh.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.337
I think she was
on the north end of the eye.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.675
[chuckles] Which means the bands
would have pushed her...

24:29.092 --> 24:30.260
Closer to shore.

24:30.844 --> 24:31.803
[man] That's right.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.972
Now, by my calculations,

24:35.599 --> 24:40.061
the Royal Merchant...
is about ten miles thataway.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.232
Come on.<i> </i>Come on.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.536
Right here is where the Point used to be.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.164
My calculations say
the Merchant's right about there,

24:59.247 --> 25:00.665
down about 1,000 feet.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.502
That's what my dad used to say.

25:03.960 --> 25:04.878
Yup.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.301
Yeah, I-- I know this is weird, all right?

25:11.885 --> 25:14.221
Do you know anything about this?

25:15.847 --> 25:20.685
Look, it-- it says Redfield in the back,
in my dad's handwriting.

25:21.561 --> 25:25.440
Yeah, I don't know why I'm here,
but I feel like I'm supposed to be here.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.151
Do-- do you have anything to give to me,
or to...

25:29.194 --> 25:30.362
Where are you going?

25:31.404 --> 25:34.241
Wait a minute. Look...
Look, man, I know this is weird.

25:34.324 --> 25:35.951
I just thought, hoped,

25:36.034 --> 25:39.204
maybe you would know something about this,
all right?

25:39.871 --> 25:41.623
Sir, you won't believe
what he's been through

25:41.706 --> 25:42.666
in the past 24 hours.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.918
I mean, threatened, shot at, home invaded.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.461
-Home invaded?
-My rooster was killed.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.130
Look, man, my dad wanted me
to talk to you, okay?

25:49.214 --> 25:51.633
If there's anything
you could think of that would help us,

25:51.716 --> 25:52.884
please, just tell us, okay?

25:52.968 --> 25:55.178
-Look, man, please!
-[Kie] John B.

25:55.971 --> 25:59.266
-If you know anything, just-- just--
-[radio beeps]

25:59.849 --> 26:03.019
Wanda, I got two kids on drugs up here
at the lighthouse.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.229
-Call the police.
-No!

26:04.312 --> 26:05.438
-No, no, no!
-Let go! [yells]

26:05.855 --> 26:08.149
-[Kie] What are you doing?
-[John B] It was an accident.

26:08.233 --> 26:11.027
-John B, we have to go.
-[John B] I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.071
-[man groaning]
-Oh, shit.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.033
Wanda, I'm bleedin'. I've been assaulted.

26:17.701 --> 26:18.660
[groans]

26:18.743 --> 26:20.203
[Wanda, on radio] <i>Police en route.</i>

26:20.287 --> 26:21.288
[siren approaching]

26:23.415 --> 26:24.374
[Pope] Oh, shit.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.544
[both panting]

26:31.673 --> 26:32.591
[Kie] Seriously?

26:33.008 --> 26:34.634
Shit. This way. This way.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.557
[grunts]

26:42.434 --> 26:45.729
Hey, look. You've-- you've got to admit,
that was kind of promising.

26:45.812 --> 26:49.316
I mean, my dad, the Royal Merchant,
the ranger,<i> </i>the Royal Merchant.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.568
I mean, coincidence?
I don't-- I don't think so.

26:51.651 --> 26:54.571
-It's his job to know about shipwrecks.
-Okay, but the Royal Merchant?

26:54.654 --> 26:57.198
That's like
the most famous shipwreck of all time.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.035
Redfield's one of the most common names
in the Outer Banks.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.244
That could mean anything.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.332
Look, as wild-goose chases go,
this was a really good one.

27:05.415 --> 27:08.001
Look, I don't know. Maybe we missed
something at the lighthouse.

27:08.084 --> 27:09.044
We-- we should go back.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.380
[chuckling] You believe me, right?

27:14.883 --> 27:17.636
-Right?
-I think there might be

27:17.719 --> 27:21.097
some light to moderate concocting
going on at this point.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.016
-Look, uh... I get it.
-Kie, come on.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.019
[Kie] You miss your dad. I know.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.772
I just don't understand
why he would put a clue on a compass.

27:28.855 --> 27:30.607
'Cause he knew it would come back to me.

27:37.656 --> 27:41.034
[Kie] You're losing it.
You gotta pull it together.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.086
Uh...

27:51.920 --> 27:53.755
-What was that?
-You.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.757
-Uh... I'm--
-Uh...

27:55.840 --> 27:57.926
I'm... Shit. I'm... I'm sorry.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.636
-I-- I--
-[Kie] It's okay.

28:00.261 --> 28:01.471
Oh, God, I'm an idiot.

28:01.554 --> 28:04.015
No, it's okay. No, it's okay.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.226
-I'm-- It's because I'm freaking out...
-[Kie] No.

28:06.309 --> 28:08.895
-...about my dad and the DCS stuff.
-Stop. It's okay. I get--

28:08.978 --> 28:12.565
-I can't breathe sometimes.
-[Kie] I know. Look, I don't even mind.

28:12.649 --> 28:13.566
What?

28:14.401 --> 28:16.027
-It's the rules, you know?
-[clears throat]

28:16.403 --> 28:18.488
-Yeah, yeah.
-No Pogue-on-Pogue macking.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.451
-Right, rules.
-[siren blares]

28:24.035 --> 28:26.538
Routledge. I got you, son.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.833
Now, why don't you just be chill
and not make me chase you?

28:32.544 --> 28:33.878
Hands where I can see 'em.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.054
[Peterkin] I feel for you, kid.
I really do.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.850
I know since they never found your dad,

28:46.933 --> 28:49.936
a part of you thinks
he might walk through that door someday.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.856
-I don't blame you.
-[Kie] You know I'm a minor, right?

28:53.189 --> 28:56.192
[Peterkin] But goin' on fandangos
ain't gonna bring him back.

28:57.819 --> 29:01.406
He's been missin' at sea for nine months.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.451
Your father's dead.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.164
You don't know that.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.373
[Peterkin] Yeah, I do.

29:10.790 --> 29:14.502
And as hard as it is, it'd be best for you
to accept it and move on.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.213
You've been runnin' around
gettin' caught up in things

29:17.297 --> 29:18.631
that do not involve you.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.884
And now you in a heap of trouble.

29:21.384 --> 29:23.887
It's not just foster care
we're talkin' about.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.096
It's assault,

29:25.180 --> 29:27.807
battery, JD time.

29:33.229 --> 29:37.400
I can still help you out,
but we gotta do a little tit for tat.

29:38.234 --> 29:42.530
And this time,
you gotta tat a whole lot better.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.660
I know you've gotten hold of a compass.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.124
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.794
[Peterkin] I know you took it
off the wreck.

29:57.045 --> 30:00.799
There ain't much that happens in the OBX
that I don't hear about eventually.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.594
Okay, what do you want with this compass?

30:05.220 --> 30:07.555
[Peterkin]
It's evidence in an investigation.

30:09.432 --> 30:10.892
I'm gonna need it, son.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.604
Otherwise, I'm charging you.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.025
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

30:22.779 --> 30:26.491
I don't have a compass.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.169
If you skip out on your bail
and l lose my money,

30:38.253 --> 30:39.712
I'm gonna hunt you down and skin you.

30:39.796 --> 30:40.797
-Dad!
-Cut it.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.299
-Thank you, Mr. C.
-Don't thank me.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.342
Yeah.

30:52.851 --> 30:53.726
[Mr. C] Get in.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.395
[Kie] Give me a sec.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.735
Good. You're gonna be good.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.070
[Mr. C] Kiara.

31:06.739 --> 31:07.574
Sorry.

31:11.327 --> 31:14.163
I told you.
You hang out with trash, you get dirty.

31:35.101 --> 31:37.103
[seabirds calling]

31:40.481 --> 31:43.443
[man] Hey, employee of the month,
where the hell you been?

31:43.943 --> 31:45.361
You takin' some me time?

31:46.362 --> 31:50.283
Ward C's lookin' all over for you.
You know he don't like to wait.

31:55.955 --> 31:56.956
[Ward] <i>Have a seat, John.</i>

31:57.040 --> 31:57.957
[John B] Yes, sir.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.461
Who dotted your eye?

32:02.128 --> 32:03.171
Surf-- surfing accident.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.636
[Ward] You've had a hard year, John.
A very hard year.

32:11.512 --> 32:14.057
I feel like I've done what I could
to help you.

32:14.140 --> 32:17.352
-Would you agree with that?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yes, sir.

32:17.435 --> 32:20.229
I told you you could always come to me
if you ever need anything.

32:20.313 --> 32:21.272
Is that true?

32:22.231 --> 32:24.984
Yeah. I mean, you said
you'd help me with my DCS case.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.531
[sighs] I need you to answer a question,
and I need you to be straight with me.

32:33.493 --> 32:36.412
Did you take gear off
the Druthers yesterday?

32:41.626 --> 32:42.669
Yes, sir, I did.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.923
Look, Mr. C, I'm-- I'm not a thief, okay?

32:47.006 --> 32:48.508
It was two dollars' worth of air.

32:48.591 --> 32:50.385
-Stale. You don't want your daughters...
-John.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.679
-...to breathe that air.
-It's the principle of the thing.

32:55.139 --> 32:57.517
I cannot have employees
that I cannot trust.

32:57.934 --> 33:01.020
I don't want to do this, John,
but you have made me do this.

33:01.896 --> 33:03.064
I have to let you go.

33:10.571 --> 33:11.614
Hey, John B.

33:13.032 --> 33:14.409
I'm-- I'm sorry, that's it?

33:15.660 --> 33:17.120
Not a, "Hey, how you doin'?"

33:17.537 --> 33:18.913
Or "kiss my ass"?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.499
"Your secret's safe with me"?

33:23.126 --> 33:25.878
What secret are-- Oh, that secret.

33:25.962 --> 33:29.924
[John B] I just got fired because of you.
And I know you can't imagine that,

33:30.008 --> 33:32.552
but some people need jobs
so that they can eat.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.055
What the fuck?
