WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:04.594
- You could be a lawyer, Prime Minister even.
- In the UK?

00:04.595 --> 00:06.002
Maya, where is she? Where's Tara?

00:06.003 --> 00:07.264
- She's gone.
- Gone?

00:07.265 --> 00:08.854
She wants to go to UK.

00:08.855 --> 00:11.344
Aaban Omar is our most wanted.

00:13.545 --> 00:14.864
Tell them...

00:15.985 --> 00:18.894
- ... there was no other way.
- You told them we were coming?

00:18.895 --> 00:21.244
I shouldn't have trusted
him. I'm a bloody idiot.

00:21.645 --> 00:24.454
Loving each other was
never the problem, Elvis.

00:24.455 --> 00:26.144
It can't work.

00:26.145 --> 00:28.534
The support helicopters
have had a no-fly

00:28.535 --> 00:30.034
due to a sandstorm two miles east.

00:31.435 --> 00:32.904
How are we going to get out?

01:01.175 --> 01:05.164
Two Section on me. We need to
set up a defensive perimeter!

01:06.335 --> 01:09.424
Fingers, left of compound.
Monk, right of compound.

01:09.425 --> 01:11.484
Brains, Sangar!

01:11.485 --> 01:14.254
Maisie, get some repurposed ammo!

01:14.255 --> 01:16.784
Boss! Boss!

01:18.425 --> 01:19.974
Boss!

01:21.425 --> 01:23.494
We're sitting ducks here.

01:25.275 --> 01:28.084
One at a time into the irrigation ditch.

01:28.085 --> 01:29.914
Half a mile east is a farmhouse.

01:29.925 --> 01:30.895
Good to go.

01:30.897 --> 01:32.674
- Spanner, on your toes.
- Boss.

01:32.675 --> 01:35.444
- Richards.
- What is this, like SAS selection?

01:35.445 --> 01:37.644
No, this is like, I need a driver. Move.

01:37.645 --> 01:38.964
Peanut.

01:43.925 --> 01:47.914
Tourniquet all bleeds, administer
pain relief and prioritise, yeah?

01:47.915 --> 01:49.224
Yeah.

01:49.225 --> 01:51.944
- Rab, how you doing?
- I'm fine.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.184
You've been shot, so your adrenaline
will be all over the place.

01:55.185 --> 01:58.224
- You need to rest up.
- He only got shot in the arm, medic.

01:58.225 --> 02:00.134
Like any of yous have ever been shot!

02:00.135 --> 02:03.744
- That's a good thing, Rab.
- It's what makes us better soldiers than you.

02:03.945 --> 02:06.194
Let me know if anything changes, yeah?

02:06.985 --> 02:10.514
After Azizi switching sides,
I don't trust any of them.

02:12.435 --> 02:15.904
We could have blue on blue at any
time, boys. Let's stay on it, yeah?

02:15.905 --> 02:19.374
Fingers, Monk, let's get a canvas
set up for a temporary morgue

02:19.375 --> 02:22.134
- for the fatalities, please.
- On it.

02:44.595 --> 02:47.964
- You taking up the rear again?
- Checking out your arse, mate.

02:47.965 --> 02:49.984
Get a move on.

02:50.805 --> 02:54.624
I'd hate to be an alligator.
Imagine doing this all day long.

02:56.035 --> 02:59.504
- Don't laugh, Peanut.
- Don't take orders from him, Peanut.

02:59.505 --> 03:02.924
We're in the Army. Taking
orders is what we do.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.174
Farmhouse, 400 metres.

03:08.175 --> 03:09.764
Twelve o'clock.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.394
As-salamu 'alaykum.

03:33.675 --> 03:35.874
As-salamu 'alaykum.

03:35.875 --> 03:37.424
Sweeties?

03:40.335 --> 03:41.734
As-salamu 'alaykum.

03:42.865 --> 03:44.734
Wa alaykum s-salam.

03:44.735 --> 03:46.234
As-salamu 'alaykum.

03:46.235 --> 03:47.594
Morning.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.944
Sorry, guys, I don't know any Pashto.

03:49.945 --> 03:51.484
Then just smile.

03:51.485 --> 03:52.984
We come in peace.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.814
Zama num Elvis de.

03:58.895 --> 04:02.314
We would like to negotiate
the purchase of your vehicle.

04:02.315 --> 04:03.634
The truck.

04:08.885 --> 04:10.284
Hm?

04:10.285 --> 04:12.254
Richards, while I'm negotiating,

04:12.255 --> 04:15.114
- make sure that truck's going to get us to Kabul.
- Boss.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.644
Medic, cavalry's here.

04:23.645 --> 04:25.334
Hey, Monk, on me.

04:25.335 --> 04:27.674
You're doing a great job here, medic.

04:27.675 --> 04:29.694
They're in your good hands.

04:35.935 --> 04:37.714
Extraction Plan B.

04:40.525 --> 04:41.934
Really?

04:41.935 --> 04:43.664
- In this?
- Yeah.

04:43.665 --> 04:45.914
There's no Plan C. We need to move.

04:45.915 --> 04:48.421
Right, I need a medical
area for the injured.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.767
We can only take the ones with
a reasonable chance of making it.

04:50.770 --> 04:52.834
- It's going to be a long journey.
- I'm not leaving anyone, Elvis.

04:52.935 --> 04:54.090
Either they all go or I stay.

04:54.091 --> 04:57.174
- ANA can decide who they take or leave.
- No, it's not happening.

04:57.175 --> 04:59.824
I need to be caring for every
single one of these guys, all right?

05:00.025 --> 05:02.124
They've been fighting alongside us.

05:02.325 --> 05:04.434
Personally, I wouldn't be
treating some of these arseholes

05:04.435 --> 05:05.455
- the way you are.
- Yeah, well,

05:05.535 --> 05:07.974
I'll be showing courageous restraint.

05:09.355 --> 05:11.884
Malik, I need two
units of fluid, please.

05:11.885 --> 05:13.574
Back on it, boss.

05:54.925 --> 05:57.024
- Nice work, Richards.
- Thanks, boss.

05:58.245 --> 06:01.244
- Any weapons we can't take we need to destroy.
- Roger that.

06:01.245 --> 06:03.174
Kingy, how we getting on?

06:03.175 --> 06:05.374
Well, it's not going to
be spotless, to be fair,

06:05.375 --> 06:06.964
but, yeah, slightly more hygienic

06:06.965 --> 06:08.594
now we've got the cement dust out, boss.

06:08.595 --> 06:10.204
- Richards is going to be driving.
- Roger that.

06:10.305 --> 06:13.214
- This ain't going to be easy, boys.
- The ANA want to know whether

06:13.215 --> 06:15.644
they fly white flags in order to
get us a safe passage out of here.

06:15.745 --> 06:17.744
One thing certain to bring on an attack!

06:18.545 --> 06:21.254
It should make it to Kabul
so long as it's downhill.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.304
Stay on comms. Brief the ANA
we will not initiate contact.

06:24.305 --> 06:25.944
Only engage on my word.

06:27.215 --> 06:29.604
Let's hope us sodding off
will be enough for them.

06:32.835 --> 06:34.764
- It'll have to do, Lane.
- OK.

06:34.765 --> 06:37.764
Right, I need all medical
supplies in the back with me.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.453
I need as many drips and
morphine as we've got, OK?

06:40.454 --> 06:41.454
- Yes.
- Good.

06:41.695 --> 06:45.074
Rab, I need you to relax
until we're setting off, yeah?

06:45.075 --> 06:48.024
Mate, he's useless at the best of times.

06:48.065 --> 06:50.234
I'm fine. In and out nick on my arm.

06:50.235 --> 06:53.514
I'm just a bit buzzing waiting
to tell everyone I've been shot.

06:53.515 --> 06:55.814
It's like the best thing that's
ever happened to him, Georgie.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.995
Right, Rab, upfront.

06:57.196 --> 06:59.794
Everyone else in the
makeshift beds at the back.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.524
Dyno, you're with me in here.

07:01.525 --> 07:04.664
Anyone who's had medical
treatment in the back as well.

07:24.965 --> 07:26.284
Fingers!

07:26.285 --> 07:28.154
I was covering the guys, Kingy.

07:29.235 --> 07:32.564
If you can hit them
from here, you are good.

07:32.565 --> 07:34.344
Cease fire!

07:36.545 --> 07:39.264
That's Kingy speak for
save your bullets, Fingers.

07:39.265 --> 07:42.924
Here with no ammo is going to
be proper squeaky arse time.

07:46.225 --> 07:48.511
_

07:48.512 --> 07:49.772
_

07:49.773 --> 07:51.260
_

07:51.261 --> 07:52.930
_

07:52.931 --> 07:55.260
_

07:55.261 --> 07:57.450
_

07:57.451 --> 08:00.475
_

08:07.585 --> 08:09.874
I would've put my life on him, Lane.

08:11.845 --> 08:13.864
Well, luckily, you didn't.

08:20.335 --> 08:24.314
This gearbox is bollocksed.
I'll just keep it in second.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.884
Argh!

09:03.885 --> 09:06.274
Keep the vehicle steady, Richards!

09:06.275 --> 09:08.854
- You've got one job to do!
- Sorry, medic.

09:27.605 --> 09:31.304
We'll get you to a hospital.
Just hang in there for me.

09:32.755 --> 09:34.864
Boss.

09:40.722 --> 09:43.111
Looks like we're getting an escort.

09:49.202 --> 09:52.061
- Boss, seriously, let's take them now.
- Shut it, Fingers.

09:52.062 --> 09:55.111
We don't even know if they're
Taliban or just regular civvies.

09:56.192 --> 10:00.031
- Right, guys, how much longer?
- All of us, one each, bosh.

10:00.032 --> 10:03.361
- Problem solved.
- Or maybe beehive stirred.

10:17.332 --> 10:20.751
Keep driving steadily.
Keep a constant speed.

10:20.752 --> 10:22.541
Copy that.

10:42.182 --> 10:44.331
They're heading east.

10:54.412 --> 10:57.601
Bogey men on bikes gone, boss.

11:00.792 --> 11:03.231
Boss, short cut's to the main road.

11:03.232 --> 11:06.041
They didn't know the helicopters
were going to be grounded

11:06.042 --> 11:07.791
so they can't have had nothing planned.

11:07.892 --> 11:11.051
Inside The Mind Of A
Terrorist, by Maisie Richards!

11:11.052 --> 11:14.241
- I'm ignoring that, wanker.
- Charm school Bants.

11:14.242 --> 11:18.371
So anything they pull has got to
be between here and the main road.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.481
Boss.

11:26.482 --> 11:29.101
- What is it, Elvis?
- Cause for concern.

11:30.182 --> 11:32.851
Two civilians, my ten o'clock.

11:55.032 --> 11:56.901
This country, I hate it.

11:58.032 --> 11:59.811
And they hate us.

12:36.842 --> 12:39.421
- How's he doing?
- Cause for concern.

12:39.422 --> 12:41.050
You all right?

12:41.051 --> 12:42.701
- Yeah, don't worry about me.
- How could I not?

12:43.832 --> 12:46.081
I'll never stop worrying about you.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.561
All gone very eerie here.

13:09.562 --> 13:11.491
Anyone seen High Noon?

13:12.522 --> 13:16.501
Abandoned moped, my one
o'clock. It don't feel right.

13:23.492 --> 13:26.021
Elvis, what do we think
about this goat truck?

13:26.022 --> 13:27.851
Let him go.

13:30.332 --> 13:32.531
You don't own our roads!

13:32.532 --> 13:33.991
Bit rude.

13:54.802 --> 13:56.441
That poor sod.

13:57.572 --> 13:59.541
That could have been us, guys.

14:02.492 --> 14:05.071
One fatality, boss. Truck driver.

14:06.852 --> 14:08.771
Elvis, thoughts?

14:08.772 --> 14:12.051
Call it in and leave it to
the local police. Lane, on me.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.791
Fingers, call it in!

14:13.792 --> 14:16.041
Right, guys, we're
extremely vulnerable here.

14:16.042 --> 14:18.621
We need to get back on
the truck ASAP. Move!

14:20.212 --> 14:23.071
- What shall we do about the goats?
- Why, you hungry, babe?

14:23.072 --> 14:24.595
And we thought we'd had a traumatic day!

14:24.596 --> 14:27.801
- Anybody had goat's head soup?
- Guys, move, now!

14:27.802 --> 14:30.621
Hello, Zero, this is Zero Alpha...

14:46.552 --> 14:48.151
What?

14:50.122 --> 14:51.420
I could take him now.

14:51.421 --> 14:54.241
Even fast asleep, I
still reckon he'd do you.

14:54.242 --> 14:57.061
Well, I could beat
him at badminton, then.

14:59.452 --> 15:02.631
- Do I make you laugh, Maise?
- Constantly.

15:18.852 --> 15:20.781
If you're going to sleep,

15:20.782 --> 15:23.681
you're not putting your head
on my shoulder, you wanker.

15:24.762 --> 15:26.261
Rab!

15:31.322 --> 15:33.761
Rab, what are you doing?!

15:36.482 --> 15:37.891
Medic!

15:38.822 --> 15:40.231
Medic!

15:41.312 --> 15:44.541
Something's fucking happening
to him! Do something, Georgie!

15:46.092 --> 15:48.671
All right, Rab? Rab, can you hear me?

15:48.672 --> 15:50.641
Take the helmet off for me.

15:50.642 --> 15:53.171
Rab, can you hear me?

15:53.172 --> 15:54.621
Rab?!

15:55.702 --> 15:57.951
Right, cut the chest
open as well for me.

15:57.952 --> 15:59.401
Rab?

15:59.402 --> 16:01.611
Take everything off him. Rab!

16:03.062 --> 16:06.341
You're going to be OK. Just
keep breathing for me, OK?

16:10.052 --> 16:13.421
Right, it can't be his arm.
What the hell's happening?

16:13.422 --> 16:16.331
Please make him all
right, Georgie. Please.

16:18.252 --> 16:21.061
Oh, God. Not good. That's not good.

16:22.192 --> 16:24.811
I think the tiniest bit
of shrapnel from the bullet

16:24.812 --> 16:27.621
has gone through his body
armour into his lungs.

16:27.622 --> 16:29.981
I need to relieve the pressure
so he can breathe properly.

16:30.182 --> 16:32.591
- Have you done this before?
- No.

16:46.942 --> 16:48.861
There you go.

16:55.802 --> 16:56.965
He's breathing normally.

16:56.966 --> 16:57.956
- Yeah?
- Yeah. He's coming down.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.413
- How's he doing?
- Better.

16:59.614 --> 17:00.814
Is he going to be all right?

17:00.852 --> 17:04.191
I'll stabilise him, but he needs
a specialist as soon as possible.

17:05.271 --> 17:07.141
Is he going to be OK, Georgie?

17:08.132 --> 17:13.421
- Are you sure?
- Keep calm. Keep calm, Richards.

17:15.021 --> 17:17.977
I must have missed it. I
thought it was a bullet wound

17:17.978 --> 17:19.941
through and through. I
couldn't see anything.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.320
You just saved his life.

17:28.102 --> 17:31.141
Right, guys, back on
the truck. Let's move!

17:59.792 --> 18:01.894
We need to get him medevac'd.

18:02.095 --> 18:03.695
- Any news on the sandstorm?
- No.

18:04.522 --> 18:07.851
There's a decent medical
facility back at the barracks.

18:07.852 --> 18:10.101
Let's keep him alive until then.

18:10.102 --> 18:12.911
You've worked miracles here, Georgie.

18:15.072 --> 18:17.601
Just letting you know that I love you.

18:19.572 --> 18:21.351
I know you do.

18:35.092 --> 18:37.100
Kabul, here we come!

18:37.101 --> 18:39.160
Second gear never let me down.

18:49.101 --> 18:52.520
Small entry wound under left arm
caused, I believe, by shrapnel,

18:52.521 --> 18:54.490
resulting in tension pneumothorax,

18:54.491 --> 18:57.020
which I've aspirated
and now he's stable.

18:57.021 --> 19:00.020
Vital signs: BP, 110 over 65, pulse 110.

19:00.021 --> 19:02.180
Flesh wound right deltoid, dressed.

19:03.261 --> 19:05.270
Come on, Rab.

19:09.541 --> 19:11.510
Really top marks, medic.

19:13.481 --> 19:15.145
He never mentioned his chest.

19:15.146 --> 19:17.790
He just kept banging on about his arm.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.430
He's a wanker.

19:20.511 --> 19:22.670
Hey, he's going to be all right.

19:22.671 --> 19:24.030
Promise?

19:24.031 --> 19:25.530
Yeah.

19:45.091 --> 19:46.470
We got them back here.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.971
- We got them back here.
- Yeah.

19:54.501 --> 19:56.510
We got back here, guys...

19:57.681 --> 19:59.650
... and I couldn't be more proud.

20:00.641 --> 20:04.530
You've conducted yourselves
with dignity and heroism.

20:07.111 --> 20:09.780
Once we get clearance,
we're out of here,

20:09.781 --> 20:12.680
never to darken
Afghanistan's doorstep again.

20:14.231 --> 20:15.780
Never again.

20:17.751 --> 20:21.400
Now, double away and start to
look like Her Majesty's soldiers.

20:21.401 --> 20:22.810
Boss.

20:22.811 --> 20:24.690
Right guys, move.

21:26.101 --> 21:29.240
- The water's running out yellow!
- That'll be the sand and dust.

21:29.241 --> 21:30.740
Or you're pissing!

21:30.741 --> 21:33.500
Took me about a month to get
Afghan out of my hair last time.

21:33.501 --> 21:36.030
I've got some proper
dust bogies up me schnozz.

21:36.031 --> 21:38.240
I'll need a spoon to
prize these buggers out!

21:38.241 --> 21:41.240
Remind me again, Monk, why
haven't you got a girlfriend.

21:41.241 --> 21:43.250
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

21:43.251 --> 21:45.360
Shots fired!

21:47.521 --> 21:50.290
What do you mean you can't
believe you got shot? I can.

21:56.801 --> 21:59.470
- You all right?
- I've brought some grapes for Rab.

22:00.511 --> 22:02.800
- Grapes?
- Imaginary, obviously.

22:02.801 --> 22:04.350
Obviously.

22:05.801 --> 22:07.210
Thanks.

22:07.211 --> 22:09.790
By way of a thank you for saving Wanker.

22:09.791 --> 22:11.520
Touched. Thanks.

22:11.521 --> 22:13.490
Is he well enough for visitors?

22:13.491 --> 22:16.260
I'm not dead. I can
hear you. Unfortunately!

22:16.261 --> 22:17.800
He'll be all right.

22:17.801 --> 22:20.570
He'll be on the first
available flight back to the UK.

22:20.571 --> 22:23.240
- Will you go with him?
- No. They don't need me.

22:23.241 --> 22:26.800
There'll be doctors on board.
Plus I'll be heading back to Nepal.

22:26.801 --> 22:28.490
I'll be back in a minute.

22:33.221 --> 22:34.490
Hey.

22:37.631 --> 22:39.660
Did I just hear you say
you're going back to Nepal?

22:39.661 --> 22:40.661
Yeah.

22:40.791 --> 22:42.980
- Yeah, I've got a job to finish.
- Right.

22:44.061 --> 22:45.880
You're not...

22:45.921 --> 22:48.700
You're not going to see
what's his name, are you?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.240
No.

22:50.241 --> 22:52.820
No, I'm going back to build prefabs.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.430
Good.

22:56.431 --> 22:57.930
Really good.

23:01.451 --> 23:03.470
- I'd give it all up for you, you know.
- Elvis!

23:03.571 --> 23:04.640
What?!

23:04.941 --> 23:06.841
Honestly, what is it? I don't get it.

23:06.891 --> 23:09.460
- How could I ever trust you?
- Because you can.

23:09.461 --> 23:10.920
Yeah?

23:12.561 --> 23:14.430
Listen to me, I've changed.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.570
OK? I have. I know I have.

23:19.501 --> 23:22.820
Giving everything up for you is
the only way I know how to prove...

23:22.821 --> 23:24.230
Elvis...

23:24.231 --> 23:27.460
I don't want you to give
everything up for me.

23:27.461 --> 23:29.060
- No?
- No.

23:33.601 --> 23:35.530
I could do training.

23:35.531 --> 23:38.430
Work in SAS selection in Hereford.

23:38.431 --> 23:41.060
And stay at home with the
babies while I go on tour?

23:41.061 --> 23:42.890
Are we having babies now?

23:44.811 --> 23:46.170
Medic!

23:46.171 --> 23:48.790
Couldn't she have brought
me some imaginary chocolate?

23:48.791 --> 23:51.040
- It's fattening.
- What are you talking about?

23:51.041 --> 23:52.481
- It's fattening.
- On this bod?

23:52.482 --> 23:54.182
- Oh, my God.
- Beach bod.

23:54.441 --> 23:57.050
How are you feeling,
Rab? You feeling better?

23:57.051 --> 23:58.830
Brilliant. More morphine, please.

23:58.831 --> 24:00.631
No, you've had too much already.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.080
Brains.

24:07.081 --> 24:08.810
Brains!

24:08.811 --> 24:10.730
What's the Wi-Fi password?

24:10.731 --> 24:12.560
Capital K...

24:12.561 --> 24:14.300
a-b-u-l...

24:14.301 --> 24:16.550
two-three-nine-one-two...

24:16.551 --> 24:18.280
lower case c.

24:18.281 --> 24:20.300
I was going to say relax, guys,

24:20.301 --> 24:21.804
but you already got
the memo by the looks.

24:21.805 --> 24:23.625
What's happening, Kingy?

24:23.631 --> 24:26.300
Looks like we're going to be
chilling here a bit longer.

24:26.301 --> 24:28.220
Sandstorm still fucking with us?

24:28.221 --> 24:30.560
You should be a weatherman, Richards.

24:30.561 --> 24:32.810
Weather person, you dinosaur.

24:34.361 --> 24:36.490
- How's Kalil?
- Ooh!

24:36.491 --> 24:37.891
Yeah, how is Rab?

24:37.991 --> 24:41.020
What you asking me
for? I don't even care.

24:42.101 --> 24:44.530
Who's overdone it on the deodorant?

24:44.531 --> 24:45.857
It was one quick spray.

24:45.858 --> 24:48.005
Bollocks! One quick spray, my arse!

24:48.031 --> 24:49.030
It smells great.

24:49.031 --> 24:50.631
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:51.431 --> 24:53.300
Not the taxman is it, Maisie?

24:54.891 --> 24:56.530
It's Tara.

24:57.711 --> 24:59.580
Oh, my God, she's in Pakistan.

25:03.571 --> 25:05.680
- Georgie.
- What is it, Richards?

25:06.801 --> 25:08.820
I've got a video message from Tara.

25:08.821 --> 25:11.440
It's a couple of days old by the looks.

25:11.441 --> 25:13.220
I got to New Delhi on a bus,

25:13.221 --> 25:17.020
then I had to get a train to Quetta.

25:18.141 --> 25:21.050
- What can we do?
- Well, there's nothing we can do, is there?

25:21.051 --> 25:24.050
She was getting in a car to
travel to the Pakistan-Iran border.

25:24.051 --> 25:26.820
What about her phone? Have
you tried calling it back?

25:26.821 --> 25:28.830
- Of course. I'm trying again.
- OK.

25:45.431 --> 25:46.690
Hello.

25:46.691 --> 25:48.050
Tara?

25:48.051 --> 25:50.540
Tara, can you please listen to me?

25:50.541 --> 25:54.050
Right, we need you to get to
the nearest police station.

25:54.051 --> 25:55.840
Can you do that for me?

25:55.841 --> 25:58.180
It's fine. I am fine.

25:58.181 --> 26:00.340
They can get us across the border.

26:00.341 --> 26:03.950
- What border?
- I got to get to UK.

26:14.351 --> 26:16.600
She's turned the phone off.

26:22.791 --> 26:25.390
Captain Khan says one tried
and tested trafficking route

26:25.391 --> 26:27.960
is for people to try and
blend in with Shia pilgrims

26:27.961 --> 26:29.640
on their way to Iran.

26:34.741 --> 26:37.510
Depending on how much
she's paid her smugglers,

26:37.511 --> 26:39.850
they may arrange transport to Tehran.

26:41.351 --> 26:42.950
Is that what normally happens?

26:44.031 --> 26:47.030
Well, if you know this, why
don't we do something about it?

26:47.031 --> 26:50.030
Richards, why would the Afghan
military be able to intervene

26:50.031 --> 26:53.030
with refugees on the
Pakistan-Iran border?

26:53.031 --> 26:54.670
Well, why wouldn't they, sir?

26:55.641 --> 26:58.220
From Tehran, what happens then?

26:58.221 --> 27:02.160
They will most likely try and
progress on to the Turkish border.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.690
What happens if she
gets into Turkey, then?

27:07.731 --> 27:10.640
It's that fucking sea crossing.
I've seen it on the news.

27:10.641 --> 27:13.270
Hundreds of them clinging on to a dingy.

27:13.271 --> 27:14.860
All the stuff the Army can do,

27:14.861 --> 27:17.110
we fly off and sort shit
out all over the world,

27:17.111 --> 27:19.320
but we can't go in and
save that little girl.

27:19.321 --> 27:21.100
There are a million Taras.

27:21.101 --> 27:23.680
That's why the Army
say don't get involved.

27:23.681 --> 27:26.630
Yeah, but we do get involved,
don't we? That's the point.

27:26.631 --> 27:29.160
- Do you keep trying her phone?
- Um, yes!

27:38.441 --> 27:41.020
Do you reckon he's coming back for that?

27:51.241 --> 27:54.710
Do we have internal plans of
the target building? Requested.

27:54.711 --> 27:56.440
Market stalls,

27:56.441 --> 27:58.320
zone alpha and bravo.

27:59.581 --> 28:01.740
What is it, an old factory?

28:01.741 --> 28:05.440
It's now a Taliban hideout and
munitions distribution facility.

28:07.181 --> 28:09.660
Well, well, well.

28:21.431 --> 28:22.880
I know.

28:22.881 --> 28:25.320
- You know what?
- You've located Omar.

28:26.541 --> 28:29.870
- Right, and how do you know that?
- Because I know who you are.

28:31.041 --> 28:32.860
You look excited.

28:32.861 --> 28:34.180
Alive.

28:35.541 --> 28:37.690
You could never give this up.

28:38.821 --> 28:40.550
I can change though.

28:40.551 --> 28:42.800
Maybe I don't want you to change.

28:45.571 --> 28:47.540
There's moments, aren't there?

28:48.571 --> 28:50.260
Of clarity...

28:50.261 --> 28:53.219
when you feel like you
understand everything.

28:53.220 --> 28:57.529
Yeah, normally the third to fourth
pint, then everything goes to shit.

28:57.530 --> 28:59.399
Come here. Listen to me.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.779
I'm being all sincere here, OK?

29:02.780 --> 29:04.189
Yeah.

29:04.190 --> 29:07.509
I'm trying to tell you that I
don't want a life without you in it.

29:12.760 --> 29:15.818
Do you remember when we were
going to get married, hm?

29:15.819 --> 29:16.816
- Yeah.
- Do you remember that?

29:16.817 --> 29:17.817
- Yes.
- Yes?

29:17.970 --> 29:21.249
OK, well, the night
before, Mum came in my room,

29:21.250 --> 29:23.499
she sat on my bed and she said...

29:23.500 --> 29:27.389
"Can you imagine spending the
rest of your life with Elvis?"

29:28.420 --> 29:29.639
OK?

29:30.770 --> 29:32.359
And I said to her...

29:33.490 --> 29:37.989
"I can't imagine not spending
the rest of my life with him."

29:40.990 --> 29:42.529
Thank you.

29:44.970 --> 29:46.469
That was then.

29:46.470 --> 29:48.439
You don't feel the same now?

29:48.440 --> 29:49.889
Yeah.

29:50.970 --> 29:52.329
Yeah.

29:53.460 --> 29:55.939
I know that I'm never
going to get rid of you.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.209
It's probably not the most
romantic thing you've ever said.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.249
It probably is, actually.

30:09.490 --> 30:11.179
Come here.

30:20.180 --> 30:22.749
- Never let me down again.
- I never will.

30:46.940 --> 30:50.039
Tomorrow we go and get
Omar, but tonight...

30:50.040 --> 30:51.489
Please...

30:51.490 --> 30:53.459
don't say anything sincere.

30:53.460 --> 30:54.959
Come here.

31:28.480 --> 31:31.059
Wipe the smile off your face.

31:32.180 --> 31:34.479
I can't help it. I am
a bit fucking happy.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.729
- Bye.
- Bye.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.149
You skiving wanker.

31:49.150 --> 31:51.869
How am I skiving? I
nearly died back there.

31:52.950 --> 31:55.149
No imaginary grapes?

31:55.150 --> 31:57.449
We're going on a mission to catch Omar.

31:57.450 --> 32:00.969
- You're missing out on all the fun and games.
- I'll see you back in the UK.

32:00.970 --> 32:03.589
Not if I see you first.

32:03.590 --> 32:06.499
That is the oldest,
shittest joke in the book.

32:06.500 --> 32:09.169
And I still don't know what it means.

32:09.170 --> 32:12.919
Take care, Maise, and
don't die or I'll kill you.

32:12.920 --> 32:16.249
Don't worry about me,
I'm indestructible.

32:18.870 --> 32:22.999
Special Forces have located the
target to a dwelling in Kabul.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.799
The objective of this mission is
to capture the Taliban commander

32:26.800 --> 32:28.479
Aaban Omar.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.899
We will secure the surrounding
area with Afghan forces.

32:33.260 --> 32:36.729
Two Section will then launch a
diversionary attack on the front

32:36.730 --> 32:40.579
of the building whilst Special
Forces fast-rope down onto the roof.

32:41.750 --> 32:44.699
We will then clear the
building. Understood?

32:44.700 --> 32:46.059
Boss.

32:46.060 --> 32:48.219
That's our target, guys.

32:48.220 --> 32:49.719
Omar.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.689
Are you OK, boss?

32:59.000 --> 33:01.249
Ours is not to reason why.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.989
Chain of command.

33:05.990 --> 33:08.519
You've got to believe in that, boss.

33:19.210 --> 33:21.549
- You all set?
- Yeah.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.019
What good has it done really?

33:29.520 --> 33:31.159
Us in Afghan.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.489
- Right, come on, then, boss. Let's crack on.
- It's a fucking waste.

33:34.490 --> 33:36.499
It's not our money.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.519
Money, lives...

33:40.210 --> 33:41.889
What for?

33:41.890 --> 33:44.749
- Trucks assess, so let's...
- We can't even bullshit ourselves

33:44.750 --> 33:47.469
and say it's in a better
state than we found it, can we?

33:47.470 --> 33:51.179
With all due respect, sir,
we've all lost friends here.

33:51.180 --> 33:55.019
Me, I don't want to think they
might have died for nothing.

33:56.380 --> 33:57.879
Sir.

34:26.679 --> 34:30.043
_

34:30.043 --> 34:33.549
_

35:38.810 --> 35:41.339
There's going to be one
gutted engineer out in Nepal.

35:42.470 --> 35:46.219
And there'll be one gutted squaddie
if she doesn't learn to button it.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.281
_

36:00.002 --> 36:02.672
_

36:08.673 --> 36:11.590
_

36:11.591 --> 36:13.359
_

36:13.360 --> 36:14.660
_

36:15.361 --> 36:16.661
_

36:39.755 --> 36:42.004
I don't care much for abroad.

36:42.005 --> 36:44.724
- What?
- I wouldn't bother with abroad, me.

36:44.725 --> 36:47.904
- Just England, yeah?
- Just London, in fact.

36:47.905 --> 36:50.724
- What's the matter with Liverpool?
- Or Manchester?

36:50.725 --> 36:52.174
Jinx!

36:52.175 --> 36:54.004
- Or Colchester?
- Or Bath?

36:54.005 --> 36:57.194
In fact, not even all of London.
I only really like East London.

36:57.195 --> 36:59.484
What's the matter with North London?

36:59.485 --> 37:01.734
Nah, only really Stratford. E15.

37:01.735 --> 37:04.414
I don't even like those that
live on Chamberland Road.

37:04.415 --> 37:07.174
You only like the people in
your house, don't you, Monk?

37:07.175 --> 37:09.614
Don't even get along
with them half the time.

37:12.945 --> 37:16.744
Alpha and Bravo fire team on
the ground, await instruction.

37:16.745 --> 37:18.754
Back up support to Afghan fire team

37:18.755 --> 37:21.144
attacking the front and
rear of the building,

37:21.145 --> 37:24.994
once they gain access, we go in,
fast-rope down and clear the area.

37:24.995 --> 37:26.054
- Understood?!
- Boss.

37:26.055 --> 37:27.055
Boss.

37:34.745 --> 37:37.174
Omar is in the target building ahead.

37:37.175 --> 37:40.744
We wait here until we get word
Special Forces are in position.

37:40.745 --> 37:43.554
Delta fire team are at
the rear ready to attack.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.414
Once that gets started,
ANA Alpha fire team

37:46.415 --> 37:49.184
attack the front of the target building.

37:49.185 --> 37:52.084
We are then ready to support
and clear the building.

37:53.165 --> 37:54.854
- Understood?
- Boss.

38:15.715 --> 38:18.524
Afghan truck under
attack! Contact. Wait out!

38:18.525 --> 38:20.494
Kingy, Monk, give covering fire!

38:20.495 --> 38:23.214
Richards, Fingers, peel
right. Brains, peel left.

38:23.215 --> 38:25.744
- Medics, stay with me. Is that understood?
- Boss!

38:52.465 --> 38:55.744
- Has anybody got eyes on the enemy?!
- Not seen!

38:55.745 --> 38:58.564
Fingers, Monk, push
forward! Clear ANA vehicle!

38:58.605 --> 39:01.184
Brains, push north! Get covering fire!

39:01.185 --> 39:04.704
Kingy, get Lane to the
casualties in the ANA vehicle!

39:04.705 --> 39:06.344
Richards, on me!

39:14.495 --> 39:16.464
Boss, clear!

39:20.035 --> 39:21.954
Richards, clear the building!

39:21.955 --> 39:23.454
Clear!

39:23.455 --> 39:25.934
Two shooters right of compound!

39:25.935 --> 39:30.014
First floor, left window,
second floor, left window!

39:30.015 --> 39:31.704
Let's go, Lane.

39:31.705 --> 39:33.344
Three, two, one.

39:39.905 --> 39:41.264
Push right!

39:41.265 --> 39:43.094
Push on under cover!

39:50.785 --> 39:52.794
Move! Out! Move!

39:53.925 --> 39:56.784
Hello, Zero, this is
Foxtrot One Five. Wait, out!

39:59.545 --> 40:01.514
Go! Go! Go! Go!

40:03.765 --> 40:05.544
Put pressure on there.

40:07.895 --> 40:10.234
Fingers, request air support!

40:11.975 --> 40:14.504
Contact within target building!

40:14.505 --> 40:17.974
Hello, Zero, this is Zero Alpha.
Contact in target building.

40:17.975 --> 40:19.984
Requesting air support right now!

40:19.985 --> 40:22.984
- They're being attacked!
- That's Plan A out the window, then.

40:22.985 --> 40:25.564
- Phase two, boss.
- Initiate phase two.

40:29.035 --> 40:31.474
Target building, 35 metres!

40:31.475 --> 40:33.534
Engage at will!

40:38.025 --> 40:40.754
Hello, Zero Alpha, this
is Bravo Two Zero, over.

40:41.835 --> 40:45.954
Zero Alpha, are you
approaching from the west, over?

40:45.955 --> 40:48.774
Bravo Two Zero. Roger. Over.

40:53.925 --> 40:56.604
Lane, gunshot wound to the stomach.

40:56.605 --> 40:59.884
Approximately nine dead. I'm
just going to go double check.

40:59.885 --> 41:02.784
Hello, Zero, this is Five
One Five. Message, over.

41:02.785 --> 41:04.194
Send, over.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.964

approximately nine fatalities,

41:06.965 --> 41:10.244
three Cat As, two Cat Bs,
urgent evacuation required.

41:10.245 --> 41:12.534
Nine Line to follow. Wait, out.

41:17.935 --> 41:19.435
_

41:29.835 --> 41:31.944
Vehicle clear! Multiple casualties!

41:31.945 --> 41:34.384
Vehicle clear! Multiple casualties!

41:48.405 --> 41:52.014
Bravo to Charlie Five. Be
prepared to clear target building!

42:08.695 --> 42:09.914
Breach!

42:10.995 --> 42:12.774

42:23.555 --> 42:25.484
One, two, three.

42:50.565 --> 42:52.014
Call sign black.

42:52.015 --> 42:54.264
On me, ten meters, 12 o'clock.

42:56.705 --> 43:00.544
Where's Omar?!

43:00.545 --> 43:02.564
He says Omar's not here.

43:02.565 --> 43:04.484
Kingy, clear insurgent!

43:04.485 --> 43:06.034
- Lift.
- Lift!

43:07.535 --> 43:09.264
Lower your weapon.

43:09.265 --> 43:11.284
Lower your weapon!

43:27.225 --> 43:29.360
Has anyone got eyes on Omar?

43:30.161 --> 43:32.824
- Not seen.
- Not seen, boss.

43:48.184 --> 43:50.613
All call signs, roof
top clear. Cease fire.

43:51.654 --> 43:54.743
All stations, this is
Zero Alpha. Building clear.

44:11.574 --> 44:13.443
Suspected IED on rooftop.

45:12.654 --> 45:14.573
Elvis!

45:15.514 --> 45:16.823
Elvis!

45:17.904 --> 45:21.653
Brains, enter through left of
courtyard! Fingers, front entrance!

45:50.254 --> 45:52.503
Please don't leave me!

46:01.174 --> 46:03.003
Don't leave!

46:56.354 --> 46:58.603
I can't talk about it, boss.

47:05.544 --> 47:07.743
What am I going to do without him?

47:09.714 --> 47:11.213
Why... ?

47:12.664 --> 47:15.713
One last mission.
Fuck, one last mission.

48:09.104 --> 48:10.513
Hello.

48:10.514 --> 48:12.103
Tara?

48:12.104 --> 48:15.993
- Tara, where are you?
- It's OK. I have a space on the boat.

48:15.994 --> 48:18.483
But I have to give them my phone.

48:18.484 --> 48:21.763
Tara, whatever you do,
do not get on that boat.

48:26.684 --> 48:28.233
All right?

48:29.314 --> 48:31.233
She put the phone down.

48:34.234 --> 48:36.573
Relax. Relax, guys.

48:40.284 --> 48:44.543
We're dividing into two units, one
heading straight back to the UK,

48:44.544 --> 48:47.403
the other finishing off
the prefabs in Nepal.

48:48.624 --> 48:52.513
Nepal team: Captain
James, Fingers, Brains.

48:52.514 --> 48:57.153
UK guys: Georgie,
Maisie, Monk and myself.

48:57.154 --> 48:59.873
We request we stay as one unit, boss.

49:01.704 --> 49:04.753
Well, someone has to go
back to Nepal and supervise,

49:04.754 --> 49:06.533
square away the kit.

49:06.534 --> 49:08.263
We all go, sir.

49:11.734 --> 49:13.753
We've discussed it...

49:13.754 --> 49:17.503
and to a man we all want to go and
finish the job we set out to do...

49:17.504 --> 49:18.953
boss.

49:25.804 --> 49:28.193
- Take your time.
- Why are you starting now?

49:28.194 --> 49:30.723
How about you carry your
little one and shush?

49:30.724 --> 49:33.583
- All right, boss?
- Down over here, please, guys.

49:52.754 --> 49:55.093
- I was just...
- I know.

49:55.094 --> 49:56.973
I heard over the radio.

49:56.974 --> 49:59.273
I thought I'd bring them up to you.

50:00.204 --> 50:01.943
I'm sorry, Milan.

50:01.944 --> 50:04.753
You've got nothing to be sorry about.

50:08.414 --> 50:10.563
It's all such a fucking mess.

50:14.504 --> 50:16.993
There was nothing you could do, Georgie.

50:16.994 --> 50:19.573
- He died in my arms.
- I know, I know.

50:31.524 --> 50:33.583
Thanks. Thank you.

50:40.384 --> 50:43.473
I just want to see her come
running around the corner.

50:45.544 --> 50:47.553
Get some water down you.

50:49.714 --> 50:52.153
- If she's dead...
- We don't know that.

50:53.324 --> 50:54.963
I feel...

50:54.964 --> 50:57.493
- it's a bit my fault.
- It's not.

50:57.494 --> 50:58.943
At all.

50:58.944 --> 51:02.223
- I always fuck things up.
- No, you don't.

51:02.224 --> 51:05.603
You are a bloody good soldier, right?

51:06.634 --> 51:08.743
And do you know what?

51:08.744 --> 51:13.103
I am so proud to have you as my mentee.

51:15.544 --> 51:17.553
I can't begin to explain.

52:02.314 --> 52:09.054
_

52:49.962 --> 52:53.151
I know you said if I ever
buy the farm on a mission,

52:53.152 --> 52:55.491
I mustn't leave my death letter to you.

52:55.492 --> 52:57.691
Well, I am, so get over it.

53:00.412 --> 53:03.931
Thing is, George, there is no-one else.

53:05.432 --> 53:08.711
And yeah, yeah, maybe I didn't
always let you know that,

53:08.712 --> 53:10.821
so I'm letting you know now.

53:11.902 --> 53:15.321
I mean, gutted as I am about dying
and all that, I hope it was quick.

53:16.442 --> 53:19.071
At the end of the day, I have loved.

53:20.192 --> 53:21.741
Properly.

53:21.742 --> 53:23.151
Fully.

53:23.152 --> 53:25.871
And how lucky was I
that it was with you?

53:29.202 --> 53:31.911
I was about to write about
all the rainbows and sunsets

53:31.912 --> 53:34.491
rolled into one, but I
could just imagine your face

53:34.492 --> 53:37.491
doing your fingers down your
throat pretending to vomit thing.

53:38.572 --> 53:40.591
So I'll just say, remember me.

53:41.712 --> 53:45.421
Remember that guy way back
when and maybe, just maybe...

53:46.492 --> 53:49.681
... if anything good ever happens,
think that it could just be me

53:49.682 --> 53:51.911
having a word with
God, sorting it for you.

53:51.912 --> 53:53.912
_

55:04.122 --> 55:05.481
Hello?

55:05.482 --> 55:07.501
Maisie?

55:07.502 --> 55:09.981
They say I can come home.

55:09.982 --> 55:13.271
We can get you home,
Tara. We'll get you home.

55:13.572 --> 55:15.231
Stay there. Stay there.

55:26.642 --> 55:29.972
_

55:41.492 --> 55:45.241
- What's that?
- Lime chocolates. Don't pretend you don't love 'em!

55:45.242 --> 55:47.211
Where from?

55:47.212 --> 55:49.171
The pound shop.

55:50.292 --> 55:53.721
- No expense spared, then.
- Nothing spared.

55:56.482 --> 55:59.681
Everything's going to be
all right from now on in, OK?

56:01.182 --> 56:02.861
Look at me, Georgie.

56:03.942 --> 56:07.031
Everything's going to be OK
because I've got you home.

56:07.032 --> 56:08.491
Yeah?

56:08.492 --> 56:09.891
Come here.

56:10.972 --> 56:12.471
I've got you.

56:13.972 --> 56:15.991
I've got you.
