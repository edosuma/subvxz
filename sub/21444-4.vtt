05:10.800 --> 05:12.870
Well, you'll do whatever you're told?

05:13.640 --> 05:14.709
No.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.750
You should go away
and I'm asking nicely.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.793
You should stay away.

What about mom and dad?

06:02.520 --> 06:03.509
Do they love me?

06:04.520 --> 06:05.555
Why do you care?

06:06.040 --> 06:08.031
I'm 18 next week, it won't matter.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.875
Well, it hurts my feelings, that's why.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.759
I'm not made of stone.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.750
Well, they're inviting you
to my birthday dinner.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.034
They are inviting me?

06:20.320 --> 06:22.470
Now, you want me to believe that shit?

06:22.640 --> 06:25.837
I'm supposed to believe that
they are inviting me? Come on.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.719
Oh, Baby, please don't forget
to invite your fiance.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.151
He's such a favourite with us, huh?

06:31.800 --> 06:33.756
They said to ask if you would come.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.668
And why was that?

06:38.160 --> 06:41.152
Because I said I wouldn't
have an 18th birthday without Alexander.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.309
Because I said I wouldn't
have an 18th birthday without Alexander.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.914
Just be accurate, please.
Speak correctly.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.031
(GRUNTS) Fuck this.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.988
It wasn't an invitation, Baby.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.516
You forced them to, yeah?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.029
So...

07:03.080 --> 07:04.308
Eighteen, huh?

07:05.360 --> 07:06.839
I know I can drink legally.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.709
Yeah.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.673
And have sex.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.436
Well, I can already legally have sex.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.679
And sell sex.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.516
You can work beside your sisters.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.513
Breast to breast, legs wide open.
Reverse cow-girl.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.558
Alex, you should eat the rest of that.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.950
What's the matter, my Baby?
Too good to work beside her sisters?

07:34.080 --> 07:36.548
Some of them began at 13,
you know, even younger.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.040
-I know, it's shit.
-No, not necessarily.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.759
If it is the only way to
feed yourself, your family.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.390
Yeah. Life is very different
in Asian villages.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.709
No, it's not.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.593
You think your body is sacred.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.999
Well, so do they.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.557
But your sentimentality strips
you of all your powers.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.399
Makes you victims.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.389
If you don't want the money,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.357
you just give them to your sisters.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.511
It's a sacrifice we both can make.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.800
Well, I do things for them.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.034
I'm teaching them to swim.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.152
That's the sum total of your life?
A swimming class?

08:23.120 --> 08:25.873
Why are you dressed up?
What's with the lipstick?

08:26.960 --> 08:28.279
It's a school dance.

08:28.880 --> 08:29.869
Oh.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.638
With what? Boys?

08:33.200 --> 08:34.519
No, it's a dad and daughters dance.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.788
Pyke's been looking forward
to it for, like, two years.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.113
It's his special night.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.748
We had to learn to waltz.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.269
What?

08:44.800 --> 08:45.949
But wait...

08:47.000 --> 08:48.433
Aren't | your old man?

08:50.760 --> 08:53.558
This old Puss is your old man.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.119
I mean, I think it's true.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.111
This old cat is your old man.

09:01.960 --> 09:02.949
Yes.

09:50.680 --> 09:51.749

09:52.640 --> 09:55.200
-How's your neck? You okay?
-Yeah, thanks.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.517

coming from Crime-fighters.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.113

09:59.280 --> 10:00.679

10:37.120 --> 10:38.269

-Ready to work?

10:38.680 --> 10:39.669
Yes.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.232
So, what's the drama?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.034
Why can't you two co-operate?

10:46.840 --> 10:48.751
Can I speak to my boss alone?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.150
-A private conversation?
-No.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.757
That's not how it works.
We have a problem, we air it.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.036
We all need to hear it, so what is it?

10:59.080 --> 11:00.672
-If she...
-Who?

11:02.440 --> 11:04.749
If Miranda has a problem,
she runs to you.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.195
And it's awkward because, well...

11:07.280 --> 11:09.271
-You're having an affair.
-An affair?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.353
It's a relationship, babe.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.675
It's an affair.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.229
-As in extra-marital.
-You see what I mean?

11:15.600 --> 11:17.591
You call it what you like,
we love each other.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.477
I know it's not easy for you.

11:19.800 --> 11:20.835
It's not easy for us, either.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.355
Or your wife?

11:22.920 --> 11:24.353
Yeah, correct.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.476
Why don't the two of you work it out,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.195
-or get a transfer.
-I don't wanna leave my cases.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.676
I've been with the force
a lot longer than she has.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.439
And I deserve an equal other.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.433
To be frank, I'm being slowed down.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.669
I'm sorry.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.279
This isn't the police Olympics.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.677
Okay, a big part of being
a senior officer

11:41.840 --> 11:43.876
is to give encouragement to new talent.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.752
Yeah, I don't like seeing her.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.909
Speak to her.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.513
I don't like seeing you smoking.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.234
Also drinking.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.792
lt upsets me
to see you disregard your baby's health.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.550
I don't think
foetal brain damage is funny.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.799
It's serious.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.431
I want this baby so much, I...

12:07.320 --> 12:08.389
| get anxious.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.871
And yeah, of course
I shouldn't smoke and drink.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.469
Okay.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.348
Well, don't.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.519
It's just painful to watch
you with your daughter.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.397
I don't know if you realise,
but you are so distant.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.232
I'm not her mother.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.109
This is so invasive.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.354
I am a warm person.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.278
-I give her space.
-Okay, enough.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.157
All right, you're both
giving me the shits.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.994

Yeah, you're Single,

32:26.440 --> 32:28.476
but hearts do her thing.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.879
My wife might come back.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.672
-She might come back.
-When she come back

32:31.760 --> 32:34.752
tell her,
"Sorry, I marry now to me!"

32:34.760 --> 32:36.113
tell her,
"Sorry, I marry now to me!"

32:36.880 --> 32:38.393
Pyke, can we have a dog?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.036
Yeah. Yeah, like a Iabrador.

32:41.440 --> 32:42.759
(ALL GIGGLING)

32:43.280 --> 32:45.157
PYKE: All right. Listen now,
do you want a Shot?

32:45.240 --> 32:47.310
-Myturn, my turn.
-PYKE: Okay. Come on. Okay.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.992
All right, chin back.
Put your head back.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.190
-MARY: The arms out.
-Arms out, that's good.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.676
PYKE: How long have your
friends been here for?

32:54.760 --> 32:55.909
Uh, not very long.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.754
So, they're students?

32:59.160 --> 33:00.149
Yeah.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.440
MARY: If you separate your legs a little
bit and just try and relax...

33:03.520 --> 33:04.919
WOMAN: I'm relaxed.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.594
PYKE: Have you thought
about the menu for your birthday dinner?

33:08.600 --> 33:10.113
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

33:22.800 --> 33:24.199
ALEXANDER: So you're the mother!

33:25.640 --> 33:27.915
You know, you swim very well.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.599
It's very elegant.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.872
I am Alexander.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.353
Yes, I know who you are.

33:36.960 --> 33:38.757
Mary's told me a lot about you.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.190
Well, I hope it was good.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.593
You see, now we are doing it again.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.475
Staring.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.396
What, are you judging me? Huh?

33:57.800 --> 34:00.075
Who is this long-haired guy,

34:00.960 --> 34:03.235
my daughter's lover,

34:03.640 --> 34:04.959
admiring me.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.312
How was the big meeting?

34:09.280 --> 34:10.838
The mother-daughter meeting?

34:11.480 --> 34:12.879
It's very important to me.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.272
Yes, I'm sorry, but...

34:17.000 --> 34:19.230
Mary tells me you were raped.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.560
Then you must be damaged, huh?
Very badly.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.589
I'm okay.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.399
"I'm okay."

34:28.800 --> 34:30.028
Come on, that's...

34:30.160 --> 34:33.357
That's bullshit. People say, "I'm okay."

34:33.600 --> 34:34.874
You're okay?

34:36.240 --> 34:37.798
You're not okay,

34:38.440 --> 34:39.509
my dear.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.439
For the psyche,

34:42.040 --> 34:43.996
rape is a catastrophe.

34:44.520 --> 34:46.670
You never recover from that shit.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.398
But then again, here you are,

34:50.440 --> 34:51.953
a young mummy

34:52.200 --> 34:54.794
looking very good in a blue swimsuit.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.913
See, all the boys and
all the men on the beach,

34:59.000 --> 35:00.672
they're looking at you, you know.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.154
Even the daddy.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.518
-Going okay?
-Pyke, don't leave me.

35:05.800 --> 35:06.994
-It's good.
-I die.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.554
That's good.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.672
You Should teach Mary how to swim.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.593
Why? She swims very well.

35:20.960 --> 35:24.555
No. She's fast but it's ugly,
you know, it's not elegant.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.995
When a woman moves well,

35:27.520 --> 35:28.714
like you do,

35:29.880 --> 35:33.873
then it catches a man's eye, you know.

35:34.520 --> 35:35.999
It puts sex

35:36.880 --> 35:37.915
into the air.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.274
I don't like the way
this conversation's.

35:39.960 --> 35:40.949
(ROBIN SHRIEKS)

35:41.160 --> 35:42.149
(ALEX GRUNTING)

35:43.080 --> 35:44.513
Get off of me.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.953
Get the fuck off of me!

35:46.560 --> 35:47.629
Alex!

35:47.720 --> 35:48.994
Alex, no!

35:49.080 --> 35:51.150
-You nosy bitch!
-What the fuck are you doing?

35:51.240 --> 35:54.789
Left her after two days with strangers!

35:55.040 --> 35:56.359
Fuck off!

35:57.520 --> 35:58.794
Where's my fucking phone?

35:58.880 --> 36:00.108
-I'm charging him.
-No.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.235
-I'm calling the station.
-No,no!

36:01.320 --> 36:02.833
-Where's my fucking phone?
-P|ease, don't charge him!

36:02.920 --> 36:04.558
-PYKE: Baby, pack up your stuff.
-No, he gets confused.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.868
He was whipped as a child.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.439
He must have felt really threatened.

36:07.520 --> 36:08.589
-Baby, just pack up my stuff.
-I promise.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.432
Okay, I'm gonna take you
to the hospital.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.558
Mary, pack up your stuff!

36:13.680 --> 36:14.669
You okay?

36:15.840 --> 36:18.070
-Baby.
-Mary. Mary. Mary!

36:18.360 --> 36:19.759
Mary, stop. Stop!

36:20.720 --> 36:21.835
Mary, stop. Stop.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.554
Mary, stop. It's okay.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.789
Don't arrest him.

(MARY PANTING)

36:49.400 --> 36:50.389
Hey.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.516
-Did they call him...
-Puss.

36:52.600 --> 36:53.794
Yeah, Puss.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.996
-What is that, a nickname?
-No.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.998
She calls him Alexander,

36:59.280 --> 37:01.316
but I heard the students call him Puss.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.629
What's this?

37:03.800 --> 37:05.028
Glass slipper?

37:06.640 --> 37:07.629
Jeez.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.393
You didn't have to go that far, mate.

37:09.720 --> 37:10.835
Thanks, mate.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.312
I don't think they're students.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.309
Right.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.476
Caramel said that
she's studying English.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.079
You've been to his place?

37:22.920 --> 37:24.148
-No.
-Ihave.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.236
It's a brothel called Silk 41.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.235
I recognise Caramel

37:28.720 --> 37:30.676
and Joy. I think he lives above.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.715
-You're joking?
-No.

37:34.440 --> 37:35.919
Baby's staying above a brothel?

37:42.280 --> 37:43.599
Oh, man, I need to use...

37:44.000 --> 37:45.911
Do you think
he has sex with prostitutes?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.069
I don't know.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.873
They get health checks.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.791
There's a girl missing from the brothel.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.836
They say she's gone to
Canberra, but then...

38:00.880 --> 38:02.359
I think she might be at the morgue.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.518
Has he got something to do with it?

38:10.360 --> 38:11.713
-The name Puss.
-Yup.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.308
Okay, Robin Griffin?

38:14.400 --> 38:15.628
Come this way, please.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.113
There we go. We're done.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.678
Okay. Thanks.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.358
So here's an envelope for
your doctor. Keep that safe.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.711
And I'm sorry to ask these questions,

38:39.800 --> 38:41.392
but do you feel safe at home?

38:44.320 --> 38:45.673
Yes. Thank you.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.755
And are you in a sexual relationship

38:50.840 --> 38:52.432
with the person that wounded you?

38:52.520 --> 38:55.034
(STAMMERING) Me? No. Look,
I'm a detective sergeant.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.473
Oh, so this happened at work?

38:57.320 --> 38:58.958
No. Not at work.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.553
So the guy you came in with,
he's not your partner?

39:02.640 --> 39:03.709
No.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.833
He thinks you're my partner.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.034
Tell him, will you?

39:10.600 --> 39:12.192
Oh, no, I'm not her partner.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.513
Or husband.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.274
-Dad, lover.
-So who is the attacker?

39:20.240 --> 39:21.434
It's a stranger.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.393
Well, did you get a name?

39:23.760 --> 39:26.069
I mean, too bad if he's
out there biting someone else.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.189
Dang!

39:46.440 --> 39:47.429
Hey.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.158
-Can I have a word?
-No!

39:59.520 --> 40:02.239
Hey. Yeah, I need a word now.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.360
Dang tells me you want
Baby to take a shift.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.309
No. No.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.595
Why?

40:13.240 --> 40:14.468
Dang wanted to have her downstairs.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.834
It's important that a girl
works up the sex over time

40:17.920 --> 40:19.148
or it can ruin her.

40:19.560 --> 40:21.198
Now, especially a girl like this.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.913
You don't need it, man.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.513
She goes to a good school.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.118
Her family can afford to look after her.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.948
You want your room Cleaned?
I send someone.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.268
No, thank you.

40:35.440 --> 40:36.634
It stink.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.599
Cat piss, not hygienic.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.714
-Tell him.
-He knows.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.188
She's not working here.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.873
Not happening in my shop.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.632
Well, it's what Baby want.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.114
It's not my idea.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.679
You're a liar.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.079
She do what you want.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.270
She think high of you.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.999
Do anything for you.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.274
You cruel guy.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.629
I help all the women. You, too.

41:06.240 --> 41:08.470
I never once raised your rent.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.837
And there will be money
coming soon, we all know that.

41:12.320 --> 41:15.471
And it's not my fault
that your suitcase floated.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.754
Your idea!

41:17.600 --> 41:19.352
No, it was your idiot fix's idea!

41:19.880 --> 41:21.677
You don't care about anyone.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.879
I have nightmare.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.398
My whole life is a nightmare!

41:28.000 --> 41:29.149
Get out!

41:29.480 --> 41:32.438
-Get out of my flat! Give me some peace!
-(SPEAK|NG CHINESE)

41:34.600 --> 41:35.794
Fuck it!

41:53.640 --> 41:54.868
(SOFTLY) Can I do this?

42:00.240 --> 42:01.389
Happy birthday

42:02.360 --> 42:05.238
to beautiful you.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.154
Oh, Dad.

42:19.280 --> 42:20.269
Good?

42:22.880 --> 42:25.110
I'm probably not gonna come
back for the birthday dinner.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.593
Don't take it badly.

42:30.680 --> 42:31.795
Okay.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.479
It's kind of awkward.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.393
Both Julia and I,

42:36.720 --> 42:39.188
and probably Isadore,
are gonna have dinner here,

42:39.600 --> 42:41.431
so, who knows, things
might turn out differently

42:41.800 --> 42:43.074
and you'll want to join in.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.195
No, Dad.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.509
Are you and Alexander
doing something special

42:56.600 --> 42:57.749
to celebrate?

42:59.760 --> 43:01.352
Human sacrifice.

43:30.640 --> 43:31.675
Foryou.

43:34.760 --> 43:35.909
Thank you.

43:40.480 --> 43:41.469
Hun?

43:42.440 --> 43:43.589
Not too much.

43:45.320 --> 43:46.878
-|s it too gruesome?
-No.

43:50.360 --> 43:51.839
Have my complicity seen the results?

43:52.760 --> 43:54.193
Mmm-mmm. I said I'd drop them in.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.393
She's back home now.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.719
I want to do some fishing.

44:01.080 --> 44:04.436
We have two surrogates,
and I'm betting there's more.

44:32.560 --> 44:33.788
(BELL RINGING)

44:35.960 --> 44:36.949
Hi.

44:38.320 --> 44:39.639
Did a dog bite you?

44:40.880 --> 44:42.108
Yes and no.

44:43.800 --> 44:44.789
Okay.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.828
I'll get Mike.

44:47.720 --> 44:48.755
Mike!

44:50.920 --> 44:51.909
Come in.

44:52.200 --> 44:53.758
They got the DNA results.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.594
We're selling the house.

44:56.840 --> 44:58.068
We have to.

44:58.400 --> 45:00.118
We're both a bit upset about it

45:00.200 --> 45:02.316
'cause he put so much effort
into the baby room.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.271
The house could be full of music.

45:13.360 --> 45:14.475
Two cots?

45:15.080 --> 45:16.479
Are you expecting twins?

45:18.080 --> 45:19.672
MIKE: Hey, Feli.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.274
ROBIN: This is a copy for you.

45:32.200 --> 45:33.428
Can you make it up?

45:35.040 --> 45:36.234
No DNA match.

45:37.680 --> 45:38.669
IS that it?

45:41.040 --> 45:42.029
Yes.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.069
You already know.

45:44.880 --> 45:45.915
That's right.

45:46.040 --> 45:47.473
Minoi got back in contact.

45:48.360 --> 45:49.998
Yeah, we did a scan,
you know, the whole thing.

46:03.600 --> 46:04.828
IS this her?

46:09.680 --> 46:11.113
This is three different girls.

46:12.200 --> 46:13.918
You have three illegal surrogates.

46:14.200 --> 46:15.349
They're not illegal.

46:16.560 --> 46:17.879
They're helping us, that's all.

46:18.880 --> 46:20.074
MIKE: We want to be sure.

46:20.360 --> 46:22.271
Felicity can't handle
any more disappointment.

46:23.040 --> 46:24.917
She gave up her concert career
to have a family.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.194
It wasn't a concert career.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.599
It's been very difficult
with the IVF failure.

46:27.680 --> 46:29.671
Yeah, yeah, it was.
That thing in Singapore.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.034
Still, it was just a competition.

46:31.680 --> 46:34.956
Had to take beta-blockers for stage
fright and I still felt like crap.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.508
-I ended up with a Xanax dependency.
-Yeah, okay.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.591
How will you look after three babies?

46:39.880 --> 46:41.757
I've got a niece who wants to help

46:41.840 --> 46:43.910
and, you know, siblings
can look after each other.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.718
Yeah, it'll be easy after
the heartbreak she's had.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.832
I want to see the surrogacy contracts.

46:48.080 --> 46:49.638
I want to Check
the Signatures of these girls.

46:50.480 --> 46:51.708
What are their names?

46:52.680 --> 46:54.716
Haven't you got any real
criminals to chase?

46:55.440 --> 46:57.829
Some drink-drivers, murderers.

46:58.480 --> 47:00.277
Someone who's actually
hurting someone else?

47:01.000 --> 47:02.274
Don't know the names
of the other surrogates.

47:02.360 --> 47:04.476
I suppose I should but they
don't really encourage it.

47:05.360 --> 47:06.349
"They"?

47:07.080 --> 47:08.149
Who's "they"?

47:11.320 --> 47:13.550
IS it a doctor, Felicity?
IS it an agent?

47:15.120 --> 47:16.872
It's fine, honey.
Just don't worry, it's fine.

47:18.120 --> 47:19.758
It's okay.
Why don't you go and practise?

47:26.680 --> 47:28.796
Mike, you want to tell me
who did your egg transfers?

47:29.960 --> 47:31.837
-Was it assisted fertility?
-No.

47:33.160 --> 47:34.479
What about her agent?

47:38.000 --> 47:40.116
They were all taken
in the same place. Who is it?

47:46.200 --> 47:47.633
What happens if they stop
communicating again?

47:47.960 --> 47:50.110
-Like you care.
-About the babies? I do.

47:52.880 --> 47:53.869
Hey.

47:54.240 --> 47:55.389
(PHONE CAMERA CLICKS)

47:58.840 --> 47:59.829
Thanks.

48:26.200 --> 48:29.237
ALEXANDER: Wow! So you go for
cutesy-pie, huh?

48:29.800 --> 48:30.789
Yeah.

48:31.280 --> 48:32.349
That's me.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.192
Dang won't let me in the waiting room.

48:36.840 --> 48:39.149
She keeps screaming,
"I Should vacuum the halls."

48:40.040 --> 48:41.234
But I am ready.

48:42.720 --> 48:43.994
She's just not letting me.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.035
(CLEARS THROAT)

48:46.120 --> 48:47.519
Then you go to the street.

48:56.880 --> 48:57.949
Where?

48:59.280 --> 49:00.998
What, you don't know where?

49:02.680 --> 49:03.954
I think you do.

49:05.720 --> 49:07.119
I'll show you where.

49:32.200 --> 49:33.553
-Hey.
-What's the go?

49:33.640 --> 49:34.629
Um...

49:35.720 --> 49:37.870
How much do you charge for a suck-off?

49:40.120 --> 49:41.348
VVho,you?

49:42.240 --> 49:43.593
No, for one man.

49:45.080 --> 49:46.069
Bareback, 50.

49:49.360 --> 49:50.588
Okay. We're okay.

49:52.480 --> 49:53.913
What are you looking for, you two?

49:55.720 --> 49:57.278
No, we don't need your help, okay?

49:57.360 --> 49:58.634
You can fuck off now, please.

49:58.720 --> 49:59.869
Fifty is it.

49:59.960 --> 50:02.030
-You're not gonna get cheaper than that.
-Okay, thank you.

50:02.120 --> 50:03.519
You fucking arsehole!

50:13.440 --> 50:14.668
I'm really scared.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.831
Oh, yeah, I can see that.

50:18.080 --> 50:19.752
I want to do it at Dang's.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.399
I don't want to do it here.

50:23.480 --> 50:24.959
-It's too much here.
-Okay.

50:25.240 --> 50:26.309
Listen.

50:27.920 --> 50:29.876
I'm going to hit you now on the face.

50:30.240 --> 50:31.355
-No.
-Yes!

(GASPS)

50:33.160 --> 50:34.752
-Yes, now stop it!
-Puss!

50:35.560 --> 50:37.551
Now, something I ask you.

50:38.200 --> 50:40.634
You think this is worse than
what the Johns will do to you?

50:40.920 --> 50:42.399
-I don't know.
-No!

50:42.680 --> 50:44.238
See, now the worst is over.

50:46.920 --> 50:47.989
Easy, sweetie.

50:53.880 --> 50:55.711
You don't think it is hard for me, too?

50:56.600 --> 50:57.669
Hey, Baby.

51:03.320 --> 51:04.355
Yeah.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.079
Hey, what the fuck!

51:37.800 --> 51:39.153
Hey, cake, you all right?

51:39.640 --> 51:40.755
(SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

(CHUCKLES)

52:36.080 --> 52:37.593
-This is Mary?
-Yeah.

52:38.880 --> 52:40.711
Oh, she's adorable.

52:41.120 --> 52:42.394
What was she, five?

52:43.160 --> 52:44.559
I think three.

52:46.840 --> 52:47.909
Sweet.

52:58.280 --> 53:00.032
Look at her daisy.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.229
Very nice.

53:11.200 --> 53:12.599
(CHUCKUNG)

53:29.000 --> 53:30.228
MAN: Get down, back off!

53:31.720 --> 53:33.199
I'm not paying you for that!

53:54.800 --> 53:56.199
Can you help me?

54:20.360 --> 54:21.509
What happened?

54:23.400 --> 54:24.992
I can't talk about it.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.313
(VOICE BREAKING)
Do you have any breath mints?

54:30.520 --> 54:31.509
Mmm-hmm.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.032
Is this girl in trouble?

54:47.800 --> 54:50.360
Put the picture back
in the glove box, please.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.033
Why, what's she done?

54:54.800 --> 54:55.994
We think she's dead.

55:02.320 --> 55:03.355
How?

55:04.880 --> 55:06.108
If it is her,

55:07.040 --> 55:08.314
she was murdered.

55:10.840 --> 55:12.910
Her body was thrown into the sea.

55:22.200 --> 55:23.758
Can I ask you for some advice?

55:26.000 --> 55:28.195
It's about a girl around your age.

55:29.720 --> 55:33.030
Police think this particular
school kid is innocent.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.475
But,

55:34.840 --> 55:38.230
she's close to
some dangerous people and

55:38.800 --> 55:40.631
we don't know if we can talk to her

55:40.720 --> 55:42.233
without putting her at risk.

55:43.360 --> 55:44.509
Why?

55:46.880 --> 55:48.233
She could be hurt.

55:51.320 --> 55:53.709
What advice would the police
give the girl?

55:58.000 --> 56:00.639
They would tell her to be careful

56:00.720 --> 56:03.188
what she says
around her criminal friend.

56:05.640 --> 56:09.394
Secondly, they would advise
her to separate from him

56:10.160 --> 56:11.479
as soon as possible.

56:15.280 --> 56:16.918
But if she's in love

56:18.120 --> 56:20.031
she'd have to tell him everything.

56:36.640 --> 56:37.959
(SOBBING)

56:52.480 --> 56:54.391
I don't know how to leave him.

56:56.160 --> 56:57.593
I can't leave him.

56:58.120 --> 56:59.189
Okay.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.791
He's gonna hate me.

57:05.560 --> 57:07.278
He's gonna hate...

# 80 deep in my heart
