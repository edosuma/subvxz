Oh, yeah.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.309
Hey, guess what, Mom?
What?

01:37.389 --> 01:39.141
I figured out where
<i>wasps</i> come from.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.817
Oh, yeah? Where?

01:40.892 --> 01:43.065
Well, I think
it must be,

01:43.145 --> 01:47.400
if you flick water into the air
just right, it'll turn into a wasp.

Yep.

01:55.032 --> 01:58.161
I had a good meeting with Miss Butler
this time. I kind of liked her.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.120
What'd she say?

02:00.203 --> 02:02.831
Well, she said that you weren't
turning in your homework assignments.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.131
And I told her,
"I know he does them,

02:04.207 --> 02:05.800
"'cause I check them
every night."

02:05.876 --> 02:07.423
She said she found
a big chunk of them

02:07.502 --> 02:09.800
crumpled up at the bottom
of your backpack.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.427
She didn't ask for 'em.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.259
Baby, she doesn't have to. You're
just supposed to turn them in.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.101
And she said you're still
staring out the window all day.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.186
Not all day.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.902
And she said that you destroyed
her pencil sharpener.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.904
Not on purpose!

02:25.979 --> 02:28.152
Wait! She said that you crammed
a bunch of rocks in it.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.151
I thought if we could
sharpen pencils,

02:30.233 --> 02:31.985
maybe we could
sharpen rocks.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.623
Well, what were you gonna do
with a bunch of sharpened rocks?

I was trying to make arrowheads
for my rock collection.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.467
Time to finish your work, Mason.
"Apple Quit."

13:23.261 --> 13:26.060
SAMANTHA: So this is my history test.
CATHERINE: Mmm-hmm.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.733
"A+", very good.
(SAMANTHA CHUCKLES)

13:29.976 --> 13:31.319
SAMANTHA: And that's
another history test.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.112
CATHERINE: Mmm-hmm.
And another "A".

13:33.396 --> 13:35.239
Yeah, it doesn't have
a plus, but, oh, well.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.943
And then, um, that's
my report on lizards.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.404
Oh. Let me see
your pictures.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.829
Oh, yeah.
These are my pictures.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.076
What is that?

13:43.156 --> 13:44.282
Well, that's called
a dewlap.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.867
CATHERINE: A dewlap, okay.
(CHUCKLES)

13:45.950 --> 13:47.510
SAMANTHA: Oh, yeah,
this is a math test.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.627
CATHERINE: Oh, "A" again.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.422
Mase, that's the last
candy, okay?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.090
Okay.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.822
CATHERINE: We need to put this stuff up.
(CAR APPROACHING)

13:56.669 --> 13:58.592
That's him.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.102
Daddy!

14:04.469 --> 14:05.561
(SQUEALS)

14:05.636 --> 14:08.264
Oh, my God! Look at
you, you're so big!

14:08.348 --> 14:09.850
<i>Hey, MJ.</i>

14:09.932 --> 14:11.184
What's happenin', buddy?

14:11.267 --> 14:12.314
Huh? You guys ready
to have some fun?

14:12.393 --> 14:13.393
BOTH: Yeah!

14:13.436 --> 14:15.154
MASON SR.:
Yeah! All right.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.114
(CHUCKLES) Hey, Catherine, how are you'?
Mase, I'm good.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.237
Mmm, good to see you.
Yeah.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.284
What time should
I have these rascals back?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.033
Oh, I don't know,
around 7:30, I guess.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.271
I gotta get them
home by 8:00.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.370
Oh, you know what, why don't I
take 'em over to their mom's?

14:26.449 --> 14:28.076
No, that's okay.
She's expecting me.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.287
No, that's all right. You guys
know where it is, don't you?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.963
Oh, yeah. All right. I'll do it.
It's no problem.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.130
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.549
Look, it's no problem.
All right'?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.501
You guys ready to go? Let's do it, go!
(ALL CHEERING)

14:36.584 --> 14:39.212
Go? Wait a minute.
You gotta get your stuff.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.922
You got backpack,
your purse,

14:41.881 --> 14:43.633
homework,
go to the bathroom.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.885
Can't believe how big they are.
(CHUCKLES)

14:45.968 --> 14:48.266
Yeah. Time's going by.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.768
Must be nice for you,
having 'em here in Houston.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.650
I love it, yeah. I'm
volunteering at their school.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.606
Yeah? What you doing
over there?

14:58.981 --> 15:00.904
I'm in the library. You know,
reading to the little ones.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.907
Oh, great.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.535
So, Alaska, huh?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.700
Yeah.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.246
Are you back?

15:13.454 --> 15:14.580
We'll see.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.873
How's Liv?

15:16.666 --> 15:18.384
She's a busy girl.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.050
She's back in school.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.094
But she's working
and single parenting.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.016
A lot to juggle.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.775
You guys got everything?
Huh? BOTH: Yeah.

15:27.844 --> 15:28.936
All right, say goodbye
to your grandmother.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.103
BOTH: Bye, Grandma.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.181
All right, let's roll.
Uh, no, wait a second.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.061
You're not the type of kids
who like presents, are you?

15:36.144 --> 15:37.737
Yes!
No, you don't.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.902
Of course we do. Presents?
Really? Let's do it!

15:39.981 --> 15:41.278
<i>SAMANTHA: Yay!</i>

15:41.732 --> 15:43.029
MASON: I call front seat!

15:43.109 --> 15:44.326
SAMANTHA: I wanted
the front seat, though.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.075
All right. Well, Mason
gets it on the way there

15:46.154 --> 15:47.781
and Samantha gets it
on the way back.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.991
Hop in there.
CATHERINE: Seat belts!

15:50.450 --> 15:52.043
Seat belts.
All right. Seat belts.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.620
Don't forget
your seat belts.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.505
It's not like this car
has any seat belts.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.208
Mmm...

16:00.418 --> 16:03.638
MASON SR.:
Nice. Nice. Nice!

16:03.713 --> 16:05.181
(BOTH CHEERING)

16:06.048 --> 16:07.891
Come here, come here, yes!
(SQUEALING)

16:07.967 --> 16:10.015
Oh, that was awesome!

16:10.636 --> 16:13.435
Get up there, Mason! Get up there!
It was so good!

16:13.514 --> 16:14.766
Come on.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.105
Let 'em know
who you are, buddy.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.983
Let 'em know
who you are.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.187
Mwah!

16:23.107 --> 16:26.281
Yes! Yes! Yes!

16:27.361 --> 16:29.238
All right. All right,
don't worry about it.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.161
Wish we could
use the bumpers.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.159
Bumpers are for kids!

16:33.242 --> 16:35.165
What are you,
two years old?

16:35.244 --> 16:36.791
You don't want the bumpers.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.919
Life doesn't
give you bumpers.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.722
There we, there we go. There we go!
We got something there!

16:45.796 --> 16:47.639
We got something!
We got something!

16:47.715 --> 16:48.932
Oh!

16:51.010 --> 16:54.139
Last time I went bowling, we had
bumpers and it was a lot more fun!

16:54.222 --> 16:55.974
You don't want the bumpers,
all right'?

16:56.057 --> 16:57.434
You bowl a strike
with the bumpers

16:57.517 --> 16:59.064
and it doesn't
mean anything.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.190
Trust me.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.107
Just lay it out
on the lane.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.944
One, two, three and...
(MOUTHING)

17:09.987 --> 17:10.988
(SHOUTS)

17:11.614 --> 17:12.733
Let's hear it
for the father!

17:12.781 --> 17:13.782
Boom!

17:14.157 --> 17:15.955
Get up there!
SAMANTHA: Great shot!

17:16.035 --> 17:18.288
MASON SR.:
Get out there, girl!

17:22.750 --> 17:25.878
MALE NEWS <i>ANCHOR: Four Blackwater
operatives have been viciously attacked</i>

17:25.962 --> 17:27.430
<i>in their cars in Fallujah.</i>

17:27.505 --> 17:30.884
<i>The bodies and cars were set on
fire after insurgents started...</i>

17:30.967 --> 17:32.685
MASON SR.: Look at this!
It's a disaster.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.767
Let me tell you what's
happening in Iraq, all right?

17:34.845 --> 17:37.348
Exactly what every thinking
person in the world

17:37.431 --> 17:39.525
knew was gonna happen
before they got started.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.230
But Bush and his little numb-nut
fanatics he's got around him,

17:43.312 --> 17:44.564
they don't give
a rat's ass.

17:44.689 --> 17:45.781
That's a quarter.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.149
What's a quarter?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.610
You said A-S-S.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.620
Oh, sorry. My bad.

17:51.696 --> 17:52.697
(SIGHS)

17:53.281 --> 17:54.874
And my teacher says
it's a good war,

17:54.949 --> 17:56.872
because it's better
to be safe than sorry.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.123
That's what they're
teaching you in school?

17:58.202 --> 18:00.375
All right. Listen to me.
Listen to your father, okay?

18:00.454 --> 18:02.877
That is the lie.
That's the big lie.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.506
Iraq had nothing to do with what
happened at the World Trade Center.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.586
You know that, right?

18:07.253 --> 18:08.300
I guess.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.381
Who you gonna vote
for next fall, MJ?

18:10.881 --> 18:12.098
I don't know.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.801
He can't vote.
He's not 18.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.289
All right,
who would you vote for?

18:17.346 --> 18:18.518
Kerry?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.147
Anybody but Bush! Okay?

18:21.225 --> 18:23.148
Are you gonna move back?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.447
Uh, I'm planning on it.
You know, I gotta find a job.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.359
Are you and Mom
gonna get back together?

18:29.692 --> 18:30.784
I don't know.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.909
That's not, uh, entirely
up to me, you know?

18:36.532 --> 18:38.375
SAMANTHA: I remember
when I was six,

18:38.451 --> 18:41.125
you and Mom
were fighting like mad.

18:41.203 --> 18:44.457
You were yelling so loud
and she was crying.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.755
That's what
you remember, huh?

18:46.834 --> 18:47.835
Yep.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.171
You don't remember
the trips to Galveston,

18:50.254 --> 18:52.473
camping in Big Bend,
all the fun we had?

18:52.548 --> 18:53.549
Nope.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.264
You ever get mad
at your mother'?

18:56.344 --> 18:57.391
Yeah.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.055
You ever get mad at your brother?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.224
Yeah. You ever yell at him?
Oh, yeah.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.526
Doesn't mean you
don't love him, right?

19:03.601 --> 19:04.978
Mmm...
(MASON SR. CHUCKLES)

19:05.061 --> 19:07.780
Look, the same thing happens
when you're grown up, all right?

19:07.855 --> 19:09.323
You know,
you get mad at people.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.742
You know,
it's not a big deal.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.736
What'd you do in Alaska?

19:14.570 --> 19:17.369
I worked on a boat
for a while. Um...

19:18.240 --> 19:20.334
I tried to write some music.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.249
Did you see
any polar bears?

19:22.328 --> 19:24.376
(CHUCKLING) No.
But I saw a Kodiak bear.

19:24.455 --> 19:25.798
It was fuckin' huge!

19:25.873 --> 19:28.922
Dad! That's 50 cents
for the F-word!

19:30.252 --> 19:32.596
I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)

19:32.672 --> 19:35.892
Here, take a dollar, all right?
Keep the change.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.179
You guys are gonna be seeing
a lot more of me. Okay?

19:39.261 --> 19:42.686
I missed you two real bad while I was
gone, okay, I want you to know that.

19:42.765 --> 19:46.065
I just needed to take some
time, you know, to...

19:47.436 --> 19:48.437
Just...

19:49.230 --> 19:51.232
Your mom and me, okay...

19:53.442 --> 19:56.696
Well, your mother, okay,
is a piece of work, all right.

19:56.779 --> 19:59.999
I think you know that
by now, all right?

20:00.116 --> 20:01.663
And I'm just...

20:01.992 --> 20:04.586
I'm so happy to be
with the two of you, okay?

20:04.662 --> 20:05.879
And I'm sorry about
that bumper business.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.458
I'm gonna get better
at stuff like that, okay?

20:10.167 --> 20:11.840
MASON: I got that one
at Dripping Springs,

20:11.919 --> 20:14.297
and, um, my friend Rodney
gave me that one.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.882
MASON SR.: Yeah?
MASON: And I bought that one.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.387
You bought this one?
Yeah.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.719
You found this at Dripping Springs?
Uh-huh.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.019
Wow.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.687
What else do you got?

20:22.763 --> 20:24.857
Well, um,
these are snake vertebrae.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.568
Snake vertebrae? That's disgusting.
Huh? (CHUCKLES)

20:27.893 --> 20:29.770
Mason, I don't want you collecting
snake vertebrae anymore.

20:29.854 --> 20:30.980
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:31.063 --> 20:32.360
Is this the feather
I sent you?

20:32.440 --> 20:33.908
Yeah! Yeah, yeah,
yeah, it is.

20:33.983 --> 20:38.238
Oh, Dad! Um, l forgot to show you,
um, these basketball pictures.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.914
You're on a basketball team?
Yeah.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.412
Wow! Check you out!

20:42.491 --> 20:43.788
These are beaver claws.
Beaver claws?

20:43.868 --> 20:44.869
SAMANTHA: That's me.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.917
MASON: (CHUCKLES) Yeah. No. MASON
SR.: What, you hunting beaver'?

20:46.996 --> 20:48.748
You see, that's McKinney,
that's Meg and that's Gem.

20:48.831 --> 20:49.832
Those are my friends.
Uh-huh.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.087
What position
do you play?

20:51.167 --> 20:52.259
Um, guard.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.586
This is dried Canadian grass.
Uh-huh.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.949
Wait, have you
scored any points?

20:55.004 --> 20:56.204
Well, about eight
or 10 a game.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.383
Eight or 10 a game?
That is awesome!

20:58.466 --> 21:00.685
Once, she didn't score any
and she cried!

21:00.760 --> 21:01.761
You cried?

21:01.844 --> 21:03.016
Well, only a little bit.
Aw...

21:03.095 --> 21:04.096
(CHUCKLES)

21:05.556 --> 21:06.773
Hello!
Pomegranate.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.442
Oh, Mason, Mom's home!

21:08.517 --> 21:09.643
Mom's home!

21:09.727 --> 21:10.853
Mom's home.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.320
Mom! Hi! Look at this owl
Daddy gave me!

21:15.399 --> 21:17.527
Isn't it cool?
See, its head spins!

21:17.860 --> 21:20.488
And look at this bracelet. It
was made by Indians in Alaska.

21:20.696 --> 21:24.121
And Daddy made this cool hand-carved
grizzly bear and this tiki.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.952
OLIVIA: It's a totem.
SAMANTHA: And guess what else?

21:26.035 --> 21:29.164
We went bowling and I made four strikes!
(CHUCKLES)

21:29.371 --> 21:31.840
Yeah, and we got to ride
around in Dad's car! Wow.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.793
Hey, Liv.
Hey.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.423
I know you wanted me to drop
them off at your mom's.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.221
I just thought it'd be easier
if I brought 'em over here.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.886
Well, it really
screwed up my plans.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.147
Well, we just wanted
to show him our rooms.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.220
Yeah.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.343
Did you guys eat anything?

21:45.888 --> 21:48.311
Well, we had some French
fries at the bowling alley.

outside for a second?

21:54.188 --> 21:55.656
Yeah. Sure.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.465
Now, in Pavlov's experiment,

23:02.548 --> 23:04.926
what was the stimulus
that he used?

Come on now, people! Tough weekend?
What's the deal here?

23:08.971 --> 23:11.724
Meat, right? Meat.
Meat powder, actually.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.481
Whatever meat powder is,
it worked on this dog.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.062
Okay, he put
the meat powder in there

23:16.145 --> 23:19.524
and it produced an unconditioned
response in the dog, which was?

23:19.607 --> 23:21.234
Salivation! All right?

23:21.317 --> 23:23.615

I love you.

Just a minute, Mason.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.479
The boys didn't
finish raking leaves.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.560
Samantha did not
finish dusting.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.859
So tomorrow,
when they come home,

33:42.938 --> 33:44.155
instead of swimming
and all the other

33:44.231 --> 33:45.403
little stuff that
they want to do,

33:45.482 --> 33:46.608
they're going to do
their chores. Right?

33:46.691 --> 33:47.692
Right.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.256
Okay, guys,
you had this conversation,

33:49.277 --> 33:50.494
you understand?
Tomorrow?

33:52.072 --> 33:53.073
Okay.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.041
Thank you. I just wanted
you to back me up on that

33:55.116 --> 33:57.196
so I'm not the only one
yelling at them all the time.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.204
Okay, I back you up.
You guys got that?

33:59.579 --> 34:02.378
We all agree, everybody agrees, right?
Tomorrow, chores'?

34:02.457 --> 34:04.960
They don't hear it. Goes in
one ear and out the other.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.220
But, Dad, I mean,
dusting is pointless.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.217
It's not pointless,
you just don't like to do it.

34:09.755 --> 34:11.850
But, I mean,
who dusts anymore?

34:12.007 --> 34:14.056
You do when we ask you to!

34:14.386 --> 34:16.388
And don't... Olivia, don't
let her back talk me

34:16.471 --> 34:18.271
in front of the other kids,
please. Thank you.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.478
Samantha, please.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.606
Whatever!

we talked about it.

You have to draw a line,
you have to back it up.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.579
Okay. It's just you have
so many lines, Bill.

playing tonight?

35:11.693 --> 35:12.740
I don't know.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.412

35:14.487 --> 35:15.767
Get to know 'em,
get to hate 'em.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.532
Mason. How you been? Huh?
How was your week'?

35:17.616 --> 35:18.663
Pretty good.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.289
Yeah? What you been up to?

35:20.744 --> 35:22.291
Not much.
No?

35:22.370 --> 35:23.622
You still hanging
with that kid Joe?

35:23.705 --> 35:25.457
Yeah. And he's still
your best friend?

35:25.749 --> 35:26.921
Yeah, I guess.

35:27.709 --> 35:28.710
Okay.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.073

How was your week?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.129
Fine.

that sculpture project?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.970
Yeah. Almost finished.
Yeah?

are kind of hard to answer.

What is so hard to answer about
what sculpture are you making?

36:37.946 --> 36:39.289
It's abstract.

Okay. Okay, that's good.

See, I didn't know that.

interested in abstract art.

happen more natural, right?

58:12.239 --> 58:16.460
<i>Wildcats in the house
Everybody say it loud</i>

58:16.535 --> 58:18.287
<i>Wildcats everywhere</i>

58:18.370 --> 58:19.963
<i>Wave your hands
up in the air</i>

58:20.247 --> 58:23.296
CAROL: Abby, why don't you
come and help me with this?

58:24.418 --> 58:27.262
Why couldn't Randy
and Mindy come with us?

58:28.046 --> 58:29.844
I'm not their
legal guardian, honey.

58:29.923 --> 58:32.176
That would be kidnapping.
I can't just...

58:32.259 --> 58:33.852
What's gonna happen
to them?

58:33.927 --> 58:37.227
What happens when their legal
guardian is dangerous and abusive?

58:37.305 --> 58:39.023
I don't know, honey.

58:39.099 --> 58:42.273
I called their mom. I called
the Child Protective Services.

58:42.894 --> 58:44.066
I have you and your brother.

58:44.146 --> 58:45.693
We are in
a dangerous situation.

58:45.772 --> 58:47.524
You're my responsibility.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.243
Are we ever gonna
see them again?

58:50.569 --> 58:52.992
I don't know.

58:53.071 --> 58:54.323
I hope so.

58:55.407 --> 58:56.847
How much longer
are we gonna be here?

58:58.910 --> 59:00.583
Not long. We're...

59:02.622 --> 59:03.965
(SOBBING) I don't...

59:04.833 --> 59:08.133
I don't know. I don't
have the answer, baby.

59:08.795 --> 59:09.921
CAROL: Listen.

59:10.005 --> 59:12.804
We are happy to have you
here as long as you want.

59:13.717 --> 59:15.390
As long as you need.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.896
This is fun for us, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.

59:18.138 --> 59:19.818
CAROL: Yeah, it's like
having a big sister?

59:20.098 --> 59:21.645
Like having a brother.

59:21.725 --> 59:23.125
OLIVIA: We're gonna
help out, right?

59:23.185 --> 59:24.687
You're not even gonna
know we're here.

59:24.770 --> 59:26.192
CAROL: Okay.

59:37.991 --> 59:40.039
Mom, this is awful.

59:40.118 --> 59:42.792
You're dumping me in some
parking lot of this school

59:42.871 --> 59:44.373
where I don't
even know anyone!

59:44.831 --> 59:47.926
I'm leaving all my friends, and I
didn't even get to say goodbye!

59:48.001 --> 59:49.378
I don't know where to go!

59:49.836 --> 59:51.964
Samantha, you go
right through that door.

59:52.047 --> 59:53.967
The office is right there.
They're expecting you.

59:54.007 --> 59:55.099
They're gonna give you
your schedule.

59:55.175 --> 59:56.301
Here's your lunch money.

59:56.384 --> 59:59.103
I will pick you up
right here at 3:30.

59:59.262 --> 01:00:04.189
I'm wearing dirty clothes because you
wouldn't even let us get our stuff!

01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:07.855
We don't even have
a place to live! (SIGHS)

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:09.360
This sucks!

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:14.115
Samantha, I'm doing
the best I can!

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:16.284
And you're right,
it sucks!

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:19.617
But it doesn't suck half as
much <i>as</i> having a drunk fool

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.372
slam your head
against a wall!

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.745
So cut your
horseshit attitude!

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.706
Put your seat belt on!

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:28.921
(SEATBELT CLICKS)

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:35.678
You know, if you need anything,
I'm in Room 112, right?

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:36.758
Okay.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.011
This is Mrs. Darby's room.

01:00:40.095 --> 01:00:41.972
Oh, honey,
it's gonna be okay.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:43.147
Mom.

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:47.435
KENNY: Dude,
did you see that?

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:49.359
That concert was awful.

01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:53.067
Hook, I mean, when he smashed that
board against that microphone...

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:57.912
MRS. DARBY: Are you Mason?
Yeah.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:00.867
Hi, I'm Mrs. Darby.
I'm glad to meet you.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:02.872
Why don't you sit here?

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:04.665
Kenny! Off.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:05.745
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.207
Kenny, this is Mason,

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:10.090
and I want you to show
him around today, okay?

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:11.794
Got it.

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:15.055
(CHUCKLES) Hey, dude.
Welcome to the suck.

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:17.549
MRS. DARBY:
Everybody, listen up!

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:20.389
We have a new student
joining us today.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:22.436
His name is Mason,
he's sitting in the back row.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.684
Kenny's going to be his buddy,
but I want each one of you

01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:29.019
to take the time today
to introduce yourselves

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:31.981
and welcome him
to school. Okay?

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.699
All right'?
Let's get started.

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:04.728
MAN: What?

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:06.973
MASON: Oh, hi.

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:08.789
Can I put an Obama sign
in your yard?

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:11.857
Do I look like a Barack
Hussein Obama supporter?

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:14.110
No.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.151
This is private property.
Get off.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:19.236
I could shoot you!

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:20.491
(SCOFFS)

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:25.784
What a dick.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:27.915
He had a Confederate flag
on his house.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:30.497
WOMAN: I love it.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.174
Young Obama supporters out
on the trail, this is great!

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.127
Are you doing this
through your school?

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.757
Um, our dad's
a big supporter.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:38.095
Oh, that's great.

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:41.926
I mean, we have just got to pull
together to get this win, right?

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:43.009
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.187
Ah, I just
love him so much!

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.935
I have these dreams
where I'm just kissing him,

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.265
'cause I just
love him so much!

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:49.645
He's so cute, isn't he?

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:50.976
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
(SIGHS)

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:53.061
You know, I made these
T-shirts for my kids.

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:54.942
"My Mama's For Obama."
(CHUCKLES)

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.021
Do you like it?
Yeah.

01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:57.782
It's good, right?
(CLICKS TONGUE) Yeah.

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:00.030
Thanks for the sign!
SAMANTHA: No problem.

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:02.445
All right! Looks good!

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:04.118
(KEYS JANGLING)

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:05.619
How many
you got left, two?

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:07.326
All right, all right, we're done.
Let's get out of here.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:08.786
Come on, Sam.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:10.040
Go get that McCain sign,
would you?

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:13.415
What? Get the McCain sign.
Go rip it up, come on.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.043
Get it, get it, get it,
go, go, go!

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:22.182
Good job, good job.
Proud of you, son.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:26.553
(WHISTLING)

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.188
SAMANTHA: You guys
are gonna get us arrested.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:29.515
MASON SR.: Look,
I'm a patriot, all right?

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:32.225
And sometimes in this life
you gotta fight.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.064
And what is it that you do
at these parties?

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:42.411
I don't know. Talk,
dance, listen to music.

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.829
Uh-huh. And that's more fun
to you than going camping

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:47.532
with your brother and
your father who love you.

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:50.084
Yes. Sorry.

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.745
Wow. ls there gonna
be alcohol there?

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.081
Probably not.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.917
Maybe some of the seniors.
MASON SR.: Mmm-hmm.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:58.551
I know what this party is.

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:00.924
The parents are
out of town, right?

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:03.006
Somebody's scored
a keg, right?

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:05.683
You guys are gonna have a good
time, trash the whole house.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:06.851
Right? Am I right?
No.

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:09.179
No, Dad.
Amy's really responsible.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:10.513
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:12.599
Who's gonna be there?

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:15.686
Marie, Christine, Amy.
Everyone.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.815
Is that guy on your Facebook
page, is he gonna be there?

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.532
Who?

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:24.407
Come on, the guy that's got
his arm wrapped around you,

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:26.033
with his hair
over his eyes.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.204
Garret?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.282
Garret. Is that his name?
All right.

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:31.460
Is Garret gonna be there?

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:32.626
Probably.

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:35.000
Probably. Uh-huh.
You see?

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:38.382
I learn more about her
from her Facebook page

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.302
than I do from our
scintillating conversation.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:42.470
Is he your boyfriend?

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:44.631
Kind of.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.430
Have you met him? Has he
been around the house?

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:48.556
Sometimes.

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:50.308
Sometimes? Zzz?

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:54.311
You have a boyfriend!

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:56.184
Wow.

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:58.778
Have you heard
of Sarah Palin?

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.230
Yes.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.690
What's the one thing
you know about

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.133
Sarah Palin's
17-year-old daughter?

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:05.785
She's pregnant?
That's right.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.613
And what is the one thing
that you are not going to be

01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:10.915
in a couple of years
when you turn 17?

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.701
Pregnant?
That's right!

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.537
All right, now,
what are the two ways

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.917
that you can achieve
that goal?

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:18.380
First is

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:21.418
not have any sex, okay?

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.845
That's the first way, okay?
Just not engage in that.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.218
That did not work out very
well for your mother and me.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.258
And what's the second way?

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:29.467
Where you going?
Bathroom.

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:30.598
You don't have to go
to the bathroom.

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:33.146
Sit down, Mason,
just sit down.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:35.598
What's the second way?

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:38.268
Huh?

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:40.024
Has your mother talked to
you guys about this stuff?

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:41.104
No, Dad!

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:42.747
No, come on, has she
talked to you about

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:45.028
contraception?

01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:47.652
Huh?

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:49.362
What, has she...
Condoms?

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.289
She talked about that?
No, Dad, please, stop.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:52.536
What?

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:55.206
Does Garret have a condom?
Oh, God!

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:56.790
Dad! (CHUCKLING) What? Come on.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.838
Sam, we have to be able to
talk about this, all right?

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:00.665
Come on, we do. We can
do it, we can do it.

01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:02.341
Just stay with me here,
all right?

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:05.136
It's as hard for me <i>as</i> it is for you.
But seriously, all right?

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:07.680
I read an article in the paper
the other day that said

01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:12.056
that although US teenagers are
not the most sexually active,

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:15.685
we have the highest rate
of teenage pregnancy, okay?

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:17.098
<i>Hey-</i>

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:18.816
Oh, hey, Tammy, how you doing?
What's going on?

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:19.892
Nice to see you.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.523
Oh, yeah, good to see you. Yeah.

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:23.571
Um, Tammy, this is my
daughter Samantha. Hey.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.364
And this is, uh,
Mason Junior right here.

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:26.654
TAMMY: Mason Junior.
MASON SR.: Tammy.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:27.733
Say hi.
Hi.

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:30.699
Hi, Mason, nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you guys.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.325
What're you doing here?

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:33.827
I'm just here
with some friends.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.830
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:36.956
What are you guys up to?

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:38.161
Um, we're going camping.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.212
Well, no, this one
is not going camping.

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:41.756
This one is going
to a party.

All right, very nice.

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:52.012
Well, uh, we still on for tomorrow?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.059
No, I'll drop him off at 7:00
and then I'll just call you.

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:55.182
Okay,
Right?

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:57.355
Great. It was really
nice meeting you both.

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:58.431
Take care.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.768
Talk to you soon. Bye. I'll see you.
I'll see you.

01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:05.567
Don't look at me
like that, all right?

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:07.945
Look, just to finish
the point, okay?

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:12.575
I was 23 when your mom had
you, all right'? So was she.

01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:13.826
All right, and we didn't
put ourselves

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:16.829
in the best position
to be great parents.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.785
And I wish that...

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.296
I wish I were a better parent
to you guys, all right?

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:26.252
(STAMMERING) And I hope that you
can learn from my mistakes, okay?

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:28.712
All right. So wear a condom, okay?
Oh!

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:31.093
Or get Garret to...

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:32.298

Listen to
the production of this.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:56.747
Production's like

to get her master's degree.

Well, then she's gonna start
applying for teaching jobs?

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.611

Yeah.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:42.337
Well, if you gotta move, you gotta
move, you know? It's no big deal.

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:45.372
We can handle that. I'll still
come get you every other weekend.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:48.837
I mean, unless she moves
500 miles away or something,

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.515
it'll just be a little bit
more car time.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:51.795
No big deal.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.175

sick of moving.

Not really.

Yeah? What have you done?

How did that go?

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:07.875
Pretty terrible.

Well, when we're at school,
we got plenty to talk about,

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:15.091
but when we're alone
or on the phone,

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:16.887
it's like we have
nothing in common.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.180
Nothing?

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:22.010

music or video games or...

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:24.349

Right.

and Pineapple Express.</i>

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:28.107

She said they all sucked.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:30.059
Okay, what's she
interested in?

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:31.269
I don't know.

Well, here's what
you do, all right?

01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:44.623
First off, you gotta
ask her a lot of questions.

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:46.542
Then you have to listen to
the answers, all right'?

01:10:46.617 --> 01:10:49.086
Actually be interested
in her, all right?

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:50.379
If you can
do those things,

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:53.254
you're gonna be light years
ahead of all the other guys.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.177
Okay. This is the best s'more I
ever made in my life, all right?

01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:58.422

Yeah. Yeah.

Mmm.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.933
That's like advertisement worthy.
Mmm-hmm.

make another Star <i>Wars?</i>

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:16.777
I don't know. I think if they
were gonna make another one,

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:18.483
that the period
where this game is set

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:19.988
is where
it would have to be,

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:22.240
'cause there's
nothing after, really.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.640
Yeah. No, Return of the <i>Jedi,</i> it's over.
There's nothing...

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:25.869
Yeah, there's nothing else
to do there.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.459

We used to be

but we've kind of
grown apart.

Anyway, she cut
one of her wrists.

think I should go visit.

the Twilight books.

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:54.365
Sure haven't.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.079
I tried.

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.831

So, how do you
like San Marcos?

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:03.374
I like it all right.

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:07.087

but it seems pretty cool.

lived here?

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:09.713
Yeah.

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:11.140
If you want
the big city around here,

01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:13.593
you have to drive
to San Antonio or Austin.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.474
Have you been there yet?

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.351
I went to San Antonio
for a day,

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.979
but I haven't been
to Austin yet.

That's what I've heard.

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:28.820
So, are you going to
Shauna's party next weekend?

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:31.948
Um, I think I heard about it.
I'm not really sure, though.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.120
Well, you should!

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.447
Why's that?

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:36.783
Well, LeeAnne has
a big crush on you,

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:39.244
and I know she was
hoping you would go.

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:41.203
You don't have
a girlfriend, do you?

01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:42.334
Not currently.

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:43.960
Well then,
you should come.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.542
I'll tell Chase to
make sure you're there.

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:46.796
Okay.

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:49.132
But don't tell LeeAnne I told you that.
She'd kill me.

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:50.463
I won't.

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:52.715

his interviews with orphans,

ethology theorists' work,

01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:05.986
and then he in turn

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:09.532
was supported strongly by Harry
Harlow's rhesus monkey study.

01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:11.575
Now, you guys,
you gotta think,

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.948
this is the 1950s,
this was radical!

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:16.952
This flew in the face of
traditional learning theory,

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:20.661

and instrumental conditioning.

on us falling in love.

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:32.339
It depends on me falling
in love with my mother

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:35.349
and my mother
falling in love with me.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.518
And if that doesn't happen,

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:39.971

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:41.730

Or, "Well, you, why am I gonna pick you up?
You're gonna slow me down.

You guys made it! Good.

01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:08.442
Oh.

01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:10.285
There you are.
Oh, wow.

01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:13.534
And here you go, hostess.

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:16.249
Oh, thank you.
Can I get you a bite?

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:18.168
GIRL: Oh, that's cool.
Thanks.

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:19.586
You did that?

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:20.958
Yeah.
Wow.

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:23.499
How long have you
been doing that for?

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:25.505
Not very long. Um...

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:27.635
I went to this camp thing
just this past summer.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.009
They have a camp
for graffiti'?

01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:32.090
Well, they call it
"urban art." Oh.

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:35.185
So it sounds, you know,
less illegal,

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.638
but it was really just a way
to get free spray paint.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:40.478
Cool. So is this your tag?

01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:42.605
Is that...
Do they still call it...

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:45.612
Yeah, but you know, it's just
letters that I'm good at writing.

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:48.069
It's a "K..."

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:51.026

That's cool.

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:57.707
It doesn't really
mean anything, though.

01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.254
Yeah.

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:04.456
Where's he live?

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:05.541
In Houston.

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:07.463

01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:10.345
Yeah. Some weekends
and over the summer.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:11.546
Cool.

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:13.553
So, you're a student
of my mom's, right?

01:24:13.674 --> 01:24:14.721
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.644
Yeah,
I got one class with her.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.096
Yeah, she's cool.

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:22.517
How's she doing? You know, is she
a good teacher and everything?

01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:23.816
Yeah, she's great!

and she cares, you know.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:28.739

my favorite teacher.

out a way to rig up our iPods

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:37.911

on the ASB.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.492
So every time
we come rolling into town,

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:41.293
you knew
the 4-56 was there

01:24:41.368 --> 01:24:42.808
'cause we were bumping
House of Pain.

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:44.956
It was like,
"Jump around, jump around."

01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:46.164
And the whole family's
coming outside,

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:48.751
you got the kids and,
uh, the mom and the dad

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:50.427
and they're all
bouncing up and down,

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:52.925
we're throwing out
candies for the kids

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:56.555
and soccer balls and Beanie
Babies and Frisbees, uh,

01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:57.725
smokes for the adults,

01:24:57.801 --> 01:25:01.522
and, uh, they loved, they
absolutely loved Gatorade.

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:04.692
But for some reason, you know,
they hated the lemon-lime flavor.

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:06.314
(ALL CHUCKLE)

01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:08.270

Couldn't give it away.

01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:09.479
How long were you
over there?

01:25:10.022 --> 01:25:13.572
Uh, I did two tours in Iraq
and one in Bosnia.

01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:14.739
Wow.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.157
Did you enlist?

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:20.912
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I was, um,
Army National Guard,

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:22.664
and, you know, coming
straight out of high school,

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:24.165
needed money
for college.

01:25:24.244 --> 01:25:25.484
Seemed like
a decent paying job.

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:26.834
And, uh, did my tour.

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:28.457
And whenever I got done
I told them,

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.384
if there's a world-changing
event, I'll come back.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:36.216
And, uh, three months later 9/11
happened, and I was back 9/12.

01:25:37.007 --> 01:25:40.386
And I'm proud to say the 4-56,
the whole time we were there,

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:42.938
we never lost a guy,
not one casualty.

01:25:43.013 --> 01:25:44.731
But is that odd?
Is that unusual?

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:46.809
Yeah. Uh...

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:48.735
Almost impossible.

01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:52.106
Like, the guys that came along
after us and replaced us,

01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:54.317
they didn't listen
to any of our advice.

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:56.993
They did, basically, the polar
opposite of what we did,

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:59.492
and they lost seven guys
in the first month.

of mutual respect, you know.

All the time we spent over
there building trust,

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:13.843
these guys basically
destroyed it in three days.

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:16.297

about why we're there?

01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:58.350
Soon as you drive
them off the lot,

01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:59.477
you got a used car
on your hands,

01:31:59.556 --> 01:32:01.433
and the value's only
dropping from there.

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:05.191
But if you take care
of it, you know,

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:06.817
and you get lucky
and it's a classic,

01:32:06.896 --> 01:32:08.364
the value starts
going up again.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.114
Shit, you got guys paying
hundreds of thousands of dollars

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:13.115
for some Shelby Cobra.

01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:19.200
What?

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:21.623
You don't remember?

01:32:23.455 --> 01:32:25.549
Remember what?
Really?

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:28.464
(SCOFFS)

01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:31.383
You said that was going to
be my car when I turned 16.

01:32:31.463 --> 01:32:35.434
(CHUCKLES) What? No,
I didn't. I never said that.

01:32:35.508 --> 01:32:37.385
I remember.
I was in third grade

01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:40.973
and you were taking me over to Anthony
Nadar's house for his birthday,

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:43.605
and we were there early, so we
gave him a ride around the block,

01:32:43.808 --> 01:32:45.401
and he was talking about how
much he loved your car,

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:47.946
and so you were all like, "Oh, this is
gonna be Mason's when he turns 16."

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:49.485
(CHUCKLES)

01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:52.533
All right, first off, I have
no memory of that, all right?

01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:55.112
Second of all, I would
never say that. Never.

01:32:55.528 --> 01:32:57.075
Oh, you did, though.

01:32:57.155 --> 01:32:58.372
What?

01:32:58.656 --> 01:32:59.828
Mason.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:00.992
(SIGHS)

01:33:01.534 --> 01:33:02.626
Come on,
what about your sister?

01:33:02.702 --> 01:33:03.942
I'm just gonna
forget about her?

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:06.123
Come on,
how's that fair? Huh?

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:08.508
Anthony Nagar. What...
(CHUCKLES)

01:33:09.209 --> 01:33:10.836
Are you...

01:33:10.919 --> 01:33:12.341
Oh, come on!

01:33:13.671 --> 01:33:15.844
I mean, you're not...

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:18.134
(SIGHS)

01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:22.647
Look, you can sit there like there's
a death in the family, all right,

01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:24.565
but bottom line is, that was my car.
All right?

01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:26.860
I paid for it,
I took care of it,

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:29.654
and I can do whatever
I want with it. All right?

01:33:29.729 --> 01:33:32.232
I'm sorry if you had other ideas
about it, but when you get older,

01:33:32.315 --> 01:33:34.363
you can save up
and buy a car of your own.

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:36.661
Be cool like I used to be.

01:33:37.946 --> 01:33:40.165
Or you can get a minivan.

01:34:08.768 --> 01:34:12.693
Okay, well, have you ever
seen her in concert?

01:34:12.939 --> 01:34:15.158
No, but she's coming
to Houston in April.

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:16.951
She's coming to Houston?
Mmm-hmm.

01:34:17.026 --> 01:34:20.155
Your dad and I could get you tickets
and you could stay with us.

01:34:20.238 --> 01:34:22.081
That'd be great!
Yeah.

ANNIE: Yup.

01:34:26.744 --> 01:34:29.668
Will you get me the little
birthday present for Mason?

01:34:29.747 --> 01:34:30.839
Here, babe.
All right.

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:34.636
This one needs
a little explanation, okay?

01:34:35.253 --> 01:34:37.551
Open it up.

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:40.554
I call that
the Beatles Black Album.

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:44.388
What it is, is the best of
John, Paul, George and Ringo,

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:46.472
solo, post-breakup.

01:34:47.557 --> 01:34:48.558
Thanks.

01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:50.484
Basically, I put the band back
together for you. (CHUCKLES)

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.358
MASON SR.: Whenever you listen
to too much of the solo stuff,

01:34:52.437 --> 01:34:53.984
it kind of becomes a drag,
you know?

01:34:54.063 --> 01:34:57.408
But you put them next
to each other, right,

01:34:57.483 --> 01:34:59.076
and they start
to elevate each other,

01:34:59.152 --> 01:35:00.495
and then you can hear it.
(GASPS)

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:02.242
It's The Beatles,
you know?

01:35:02.864 --> 01:35:05.834
I don't know. I think I always
just liked Paul the best.

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:07.585
It doesn't matter, you know,
you're missing the point.

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:09.708
There is no favorite Beatle!

01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:11.835
That's what I'm saying.
It's in the balance.

01:35:11.915 --> 01:35:14.043
That's what made them
the greatest fucking rock band

01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:16.298
in the world, okay?

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:18.379

George who talks
to you about God,

John is just, "No,
it's about love and pain,"

who just says,

we have while we have it?"

It's a red-letter edition,

01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:42.900

that Jesus said is in red.

Mason demanded we work
on it the whole time.

01:40:56.133 --> 01:40:57.385
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

01:40:57.468 --> 01:40:58.970
MASON SR.:
It's a work in progress.

01:40:59.345 --> 01:41:00.562
PREACHER: A week later,
we don't know why

01:41:00.638 --> 01:41:02.857
Thomas wasn't there
the first time, uh,

01:41:02.932 --> 01:41:06.903
but a week later,
Thomas comes back

01:41:06.978 --> 01:41:08.400
and joins
the other disciples.

01:41:08.479 --> 01:41:10.607
They say, "The Lord's
alive, we saw him!"

01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:14.411
"I won't believe it until I
put my finger into his side,

01:41:14.485 --> 01:41:17.409
"and I wanna see those
nail prints in his hands."

01:41:17.488 --> 01:41:19.488
(EXHALES SHARPLY) About
that time, here comes Jesus

01:41:19.532 --> 01:41:21.830
standing right
next to him, okay?

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:25.459
And he turns to Thomas. Don't you
know, Thomas felt some shame.

01:41:25.663 --> 01:41:27.665
He turns to Thomas
and says,

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:30.467
"Thomas, here, stick
your finger in my side.

01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:32.466
"Look at these nail prints.
It's me."

01:41:33.212 --> 01:41:37.012
And Thomas <i>says,</i> "My Lord
and my God, I believe."

01:41:37.675 --> 01:41:40.019
And Jesus said,
"Well, that's good,

01:41:40.553 --> 01:41:44.808
"but blessed are those who
can believe without seeing."

01:41:45.182 --> 01:41:49.938
It's a lot easier when you
can see and feel and touch,

01:41:50.021 --> 01:41:53.400
but like us, we haven't
seen him in the flesh,

01:41:53.858 --> 01:41:55.360
we haven't felt him
in the flesh,

01:41:55.443 --> 01:41:57.787
but we have experienced
him in the spirit.

01:41:57.862 --> 01:42:00.365
At least, I have,
and I hope y'all have, too.

01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:04.201
The pond's right up here.

01:42:07.204 --> 01:42:08.831
Ooh, it's low.

01:42:08.914 --> 01:42:10.211
Yeah.

01:42:11.042 --> 01:42:12.294
You know, my dad could
take you fishing

01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:13.593

01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:23.854
No, I think we're just gonna
hang here for a minute.

You want me
to stay with you?

01:42:25.431 --> 01:42:26.808
No, it's okay.
You sure?

01:42:26.891 --> 01:42:27.892

such a stick-in-the-mud?

even talking about?

back here on the 20th, do you,

01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:42.164

01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:45.952

I'm all right.

you know.

in here, Mason?

01:43:48.973 --> 01:43:50.065
I'm not sure.

01:43:50.141 --> 01:43:51.939

Not quite, but it's
not gonna take me long.

Not yet. Not quite.

Dark room time
is extra-curricular.

I mean, technically, you don't ever
have to be in here these days,

01:44:13.164 --> 01:44:15.667
and certainly not until you've
completed your assignments.

That's the deal.

01:44:17.126 --> 01:44:18.343
Sorry.

01:44:18.836 --> 01:44:20.429
I'm worried about
you, Mason.

Why is that?

I'll tell you why.

The images you're turning
in, they're cool.

01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:30.394
You're looking at things
in a really unique way.

01:44:30.473 --> 01:44:32.191
Got a lot of natural talent.

01:44:32.975 --> 01:44:34.067

will just get you a cup of
coffee in this old world.

01:44:39.523 --> 01:44:42.868
I've met a lot of talented
people over the years.

01:44:44.445 --> 01:44:47.870
How many of them
made it professionally

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:50.201
without discipline,
commitment

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:52.537
and a really good
work ethic?

01:44:53.496 --> 01:44:56.670
I can tell you. I can
count it on two fingers.

01:44:57.583 --> 01:44:58.630
Zero.

01:44:59.168 --> 01:45:00.886
It's not gonna happen
for you, Mason.

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:02.679
The world is too competitive.

01:45:02.755 --> 01:45:06.134
There are too many talented people
who are willing to work hard,

01:45:06.217 --> 01:45:09.141
and a butt load of morons
who are untalented

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.097
who are more than
willing to surpass you.

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:13.182
As a matter of fact, a lot of them
are sitting in that classroom

01:45:13.265 --> 01:45:14.642

01:45:14.725 --> 01:45:15.845
You know what they're doing?

01:45:15.851 --> 01:45:17.444
They're doing
their assignments.

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.488
Which is what you're supposed
to be doing, but you're not.

01:45:19.563 --> 01:45:20.689
You're in here.

01:45:20.773 --> 01:45:22.070

No, but the things
you're talking about,

like work ethic
or whatever,

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.907
I feel like I do
work pretty hard.

01:45:31.742 --> 01:45:34.962
I spend the whole weekend
taking pictures a lot of times.

01:45:36.789 --> 01:45:38.962
You like football, Mason?

01:45:39.667 --> 01:45:41.385

I've just assigned you

01:45:44.672 --> 01:45:47.676
to shoot the football

It starts at 7:30, I want
you to get there early,

01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:53.014
I want you to shoot a full card, 300
images, I want them downloaded,

01:45:53.097 --> 01:45:56.601
I want them sorted, and I want to
see them very first thing Monday.

You want to know
why I'm doing this?

01:46:00.646 --> 01:46:01.818
I guess.

to be, Mason'?

01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:05.526

01:50:54.231 --> 01:50:57.485
I just feel like there are so
many things that I could be doing

01:50:57.568 --> 01:51:00.321
and probably want to be
doing that I'm just not.

01:51:00.404 --> 01:51:01.451
Why aren't you?

01:51:02.406 --> 01:51:06.502
I mean, I guess it's just being
afraid of what people would think.

01:51:06.577 --> 01:51:08.375
You know, judgment.
Yeah.

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.463
I guess it's really easy
to say like,

01:51:10.539 --> 01:51:12.086
"I don't care
what anyone else thinks,"

01:51:12.207 --> 01:51:14.335
but everyone does, you know?
Exactly.

01:51:14.418 --> 01:51:15.761
Deep down.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:51:16.170 --> 01:51:19.845
I find myself so furious at all these
people that I'm in contact with

01:51:19.923 --> 01:51:22.517
just for controlling me
or whatever,

01:51:22.593 --> 01:51:25.767
but, you know, they're not
even aware they're doing it.

01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:27.602
Yeah.

01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:33.066
So, in this perfect world, where
no one's controlling you,

01:51:33.145 --> 01:51:35.568
what's different?
What changes?

01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:37.570
Everything.

01:51:37.649 --> 01:51:40.744
I mean, I just wanna be
able to do anything I want,

01:51:40.944 --> 01:51:42.287
because it makes me
feel alive.

01:51:42.988 --> 01:51:46.413
As opposed to giving me
the appearance of normality.

01:51:46.992 --> 01:51:48.835
Whatever that means.
(CHUCKLES)

01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:52.089
I don't think
it means much.

01:51:54.082 --> 01:51:56.301
You're kinda weird, you know that?
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:51:56.752 --> 01:51:57.799
Yeah?

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:01.052
Is that a compliment?

01:52:01.131 --> 01:52:04.101
I don't know.
Do you wanna be weird?

01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:08.856
I mean, I don't want to like scare kids
at the park, or anything like that.

01:52:10.891 --> 01:52:12.143
I really like
talking with you.

01:52:12.976 --> 01:52:15.900
I don't usually even try
to vocalize my thoughts

01:52:15.979 --> 01:52:17.356
or feelings
or anything.

01:52:18.190 --> 01:52:21.364
I don't know, it never sounds right.
Words are stupid.

01:52:23.278 --> 01:52:25.622
So, why are you
trying with me?

01:52:25.948 --> 01:52:28.326
I don't know.
I guess I feel comfortable.

01:52:29.576 --> 01:52:31.203
I'm glad.
(CHUCKLES)

01:52:35.332 --> 01:52:37.084
Hey, Jim.

01:52:37.167 --> 01:52:38.384
I'm sorry I'm so late.

01:52:39.336 --> 01:52:41.589
What time are you
supposed to be home?

01:52:42.756 --> 01:52:44.850
I don't know.
A while ago.

01:52:45.759 --> 01:52:49.514
While ago like, 30 minutes
ago, an hour ago?

01:52:50.472 --> 01:52:52.474
'Cause truthfully
nobody even knew

01:52:52.557 --> 01:52:54.157
where you were
until your sister told us.

01:52:54.226 --> 01:52:55.944
She's been home
for a while.

01:52:57.187 --> 01:52:58.530
I'm sorry.

01:52:58.981 --> 01:53:01.951
Yeah, been hearin'
a lot of that lately.

01:53:03.318 --> 01:53:06.242
See, but you
don't actually care.

01:53:06.321 --> 01:53:10.167
You just kinda come
and go <i>as</i> you please,

01:53:10.909 --> 01:53:12.752
and you don't care
if your mom's upset,

01:53:12.828 --> 01:53:15.126
or what time
you gotta be home.

01:53:15.289 --> 01:53:16.916
Is that what's up?

01:53:18.083 --> 01:53:19.243
I don't know
what to tell you.

01:53:19.376 --> 01:53:20.969
Stop mumbling!

01:53:21.044 --> 01:53:22.796
You know, speak up!

01:53:23.297 --> 01:53:25.425
I can't understand a word
comin' out of your mouth.

01:53:25.507 --> 01:53:27.475
It's just like...
(MUMBLING)

01:53:27.551 --> 01:53:29.474
And I ask you questions
and you just...

01:53:29.553 --> 01:53:32.147
Can I just have one day where
everyone isn't all over my ass?

01:53:35.058 --> 01:53:36.901
I'm up your ass?

01:53:38.603 --> 01:53:40.651
This is my house.
All right'?

01:53:40.731 --> 01:53:42.483
If you wanna live
in my house,

01:53:42.566 --> 01:53:44.864
then you get home when you
say you're gonna be home.

01:53:44.943 --> 01:53:46.445
You know, Jim,
you're not my dad.

01:53:46.570 --> 01:53:48.243
No, I'm not your dad.

01:53:48.322 --> 01:53:51.451
You know how I know that?
'Cause I'm actually here.

01:53:51.575 --> 01:53:53.748
I'm the guy with the job,
payin' the bills,

01:53:54.077 --> 01:53:57.752
takin' care of you, your
mom, your sister, huh? Huh?

01:53:59.082 --> 01:54:00.550
I'm that guy!

01:54:23.315 --> 01:54:25.067
Morning.
Morning.

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:30.206
Hey. Which one of you guys used the
downstairs bathroom last night?

01:54:30.906 --> 01:54:33.125
I don't know.
I didn't.

01:54:33.283 --> 01:54:34.956
That tall guy,
what's his name?

01:54:36.411 --> 01:54:37.628
Phillip?

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:41.208
Yeah, Phillip. He did it.
Can Phillip read?

01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:42.338
You know, there's
a big sign on the door.

01:54:42.417 --> 01:54:44.044
It says, "Do not use this
bathroom, it's broken."

01:54:44.127 --> 01:54:46.300
I mean,
how difficult is that?

01:54:47.172 --> 01:54:49.140
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

01:54:53.261 --> 01:54:54.262
(SIGHS)

01:54:54.346 --> 01:54:56.146
I think I'm gonna put the
house on the market.

01:54:57.391 --> 01:54:58.688
Why?

01:54:58.767 --> 01:55:00.235
This house is too big for us.

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:01.903
You're going to
school eventually.

01:55:01.978 --> 01:55:03.980
It's too expensive.
I'm done.

01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:06.611
Why did you even buy it
in the first place then?

01:55:07.734 --> 01:55:11.238
Because I really enjoy
making poor life decisions,

01:55:11.321 --> 01:55:13.790
keeping us on
the brink of poverty.

01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:18.120
I've spent the first half of my
life acquiring all this crap,

01:55:18.203 --> 01:55:19.921
and now I'm gonna spend
the second half of my life

01:55:19.996 --> 01:55:21.589
getting rid
of all this stuff.

01:55:21.665 --> 01:55:23.884
Really? Like what?

01:55:25.210 --> 01:55:26.650
Well, I got rid of
a couple husbands,

01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:28.070
now I'm gonna get rid
of a mortgage,

01:55:28.088 --> 01:55:31.388
some maintenance,
the tchotchskes,

01:55:31.466 --> 01:55:35.221
the homeowner's insurance, the
property tax, the plumbing.

01:55:36.721 --> 01:55:37.722
(SIGHS)

01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:39.483
You know what?
From now on,

01:55:39.558 --> 01:55:41.526
I am gonna be Mommy Monk.

01:55:42.185 --> 01:55:44.187
Simple. Celibate.

01:55:44.396 --> 01:55:46.194
(CHUCKLES)
Don't be gross, Mom.

01:55:48.567 --> 01:55:49.693
Fine.

01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:52.283
I'll be a poor whore
with a big house.

01:55:52.362 --> 01:55:53.363
(CHUCKLES)

01:55:53.488 --> 01:55:54.785
Is that better? Hmm?

01:55:55.574 --> 01:55:57.076
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

01:56:01.872 --> 01:56:05.627
Mason, please, don't leave
me that dirty dish to wash.

01:56:07.002 --> 01:56:08.219
I do dishes all day.

01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:11.135
Oh, great! Honey,
then you're a professional.

01:56:11.214 --> 01:56:14.184
Come on, you could do one or two
more for your poor old mom.

01:56:14.259 --> 01:56:15.385
Okay.

01:56:15.927 --> 01:56:17.850
Thank you.

You want one?

01:56:41.995 --> 01:56:43.247
(GAGS) oh, God!
(CHUCKLES)

01:56:43.330 --> 01:56:44.502
She didn't even
touch them, seriously.

01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:45.958
I watched her
the whole time.

01:56:46.166 --> 01:56:48.919
I bet you did watch her,
you little pervert.

01:56:49.419 --> 01:56:50.591
(CHUCKLES)

01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:53.970
It's like
we're on a date.

01:56:54.049 --> 01:56:55.767
(CHUCKLES) Cheers.

01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.433
It's a night of romance.

01:56:59.012 --> 01:57:01.106
Yeah, except
I'm not gonna kiss you.

01:57:02.641 --> 01:57:04.814
I will blow you, though.

01:57:08.647 --> 01:57:09.990
(DISHES CLATTER)

01:57:13.026 --> 01:57:15.700
Mason! We are in
the weeds out here!

01:57:15.779 --> 01:57:17.122
I'm goin' <i>as</i> fast
<i>as</i> I can.

01:57:17.364 --> 01:57:19.412
Oh, then I must be
confused then,

01:57:19.491 --> 01:57:21.243
'cause I just saw you
chattin' it up with April,

01:57:21.326 --> 01:57:23.044
when I got a salad bar
that needs a refill,

01:57:23.119 --> 01:57:25.588
I got a six-top,
two four-tops I can't use

01:57:25.664 --> 01:57:26.961
because they
haven't been bussed!

01:57:27.249 --> 01:57:29.377
Enrique is not here.
I'm tryin'.

01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:32.216
Well, while you're tryin',
we're dyin'!

01:57:32.295 --> 01:57:34.093
What am I supposed
to tell my customers?

01:57:34.172 --> 01:57:37.051
"Oh, I'm sorry that your table's
got dirty plates on it,

01:57:37.133 --> 01:57:38.635
"but Mason's trying.

01:57:39.302 --> 01:57:40.770
"At least that's
what he told me.

01:57:40.845 --> 01:57:43.644
"After he was flirtin' with April
and eatin' your leftover shrimp."

01:57:44.474 --> 01:57:46.897
Now it is a challenge
out there today, I know,

01:57:47.644 --> 01:57:49.521
but I wanna share
something with you.

01:57:50.313 --> 01:57:52.190
I got you pegged
for fry cook this summer,

01:57:52.274 --> 01:57:54.117
and that's a lot
more responsibility.

01:57:54.526 --> 01:57:57.450
It's also more money.
How's that sound?

01:57:58.488 --> 01:57:59.535
Good.

01:58:00.365 --> 01:58:02.242
I know you can
handle that money,

01:58:02.325 --> 01:58:04.703
but can you take
the responsibility?

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:07.664
I think you can,
because I believe in you.

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:08.867
But I need you on the floor.

01:58:09.165 --> 01:58:11.088
Now leave the dishes.
Giddy up.

01:58:11.793 --> 01:58:14.171
All right, come on!
Don't let me down!

01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:21.554
<i>Well, so it's runnin' okay? That
alternator's not messin' up anymore?</i>

01:58:22.095 --> 01:58:24.018
No, it's fine.
It's up for the trip.

01:58:24.598 --> 01:58:25.850
(CHUCKLES) <i>Good.</i>

01:58:26.850 --> 01:58:29.444
<i>Are you gonna see your sister
when you guys are in Austin?</i>

01:58:29.519 --> 01:58:31.772
Yeah, she said I can stay
at her dorm, which is cool.

01:58:31.855 --> 01:58:34.215
And I guess her roommate's out
of town, so it's no big deal.

01:58:35.108 --> 01:58:36.655
<i>All right.
Did you apply there yet?</i>

01:58:36.735 --> 01:58:38.328
<i>Did you get that
application into UT?</i>

01:58:38.403 --> 01:58:41.156
Not yet, but Sheena's
pretty much in, though.

01:58:41.239 --> 01:58:43.241
<i>Right. Well, if you know
that's where you wanna go,</i>

01:58:43.325 --> 01:58:45.999
<i>you should probably do that early
acceptance thing, you know?</i>

01:58:46.077 --> 01:58:48.546
<i>Seriously, let 'em know you're
a man who knows what he wants.</i>

01:58:48.663 --> 01:58:49.663
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

01:58:49.706 --> 01:58:53.051
<i>A little bit of decisiveness goes a
long way in this life, all right?</i>

01:58:53.376 --> 01:58:54.548
<i>Yeah.
Great.</i>

01:58:54.628 --> 01:58:56.505
<i>And what about work?
How's that goin'?</i>

01:58:57.672 --> 01:58:59.219
Uh, I don't know.
It's all right.

01:58:59.299 --> 01:59:01.176
Today kind of sucked.
This guy didn't show up.

01:59:02.218 --> 01:59:04.971
But it's definitely an interesting
perspective on the world.

01:59:05.305 --> 01:59:06.898
People are slobs.

01:59:07.349 --> 01:59:08.521
(CHUCKLES)

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:10.944
<i>Well, when people ask me
about you, I say to them,</i>

01:59:11.019 --> 01:59:12.316
<i>"Mason, he's doing great.</i>

01:59:12.395 --> 01:59:15.365
<i>"He's got a job,
he's really cleanin' up.”</i>

01:59:16.191 --> 01:59:19.365
<i>All right, say hi to Annie
and Cooper, will you?</i>

01:59:20.111 --> 01:59:22.330
<i>Say hi to your big brother.
"Hey, big brother."</i>

01:59:22.405 --> 01:59:24.373
Hey, Annie.
Hey, kiddo.

01:59:24.449 --> 01:59:25.666
<i>Can you say bye-bye?</i>

01:59:25.742 --> 01:59:27.460
<i>Bye-bye!

01:59:27.911 --> 01:59:29.413
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

MASON <i>SR.: All right. Well, be careful
when you're driving, all right?</i>

01:59:32.582 --> 01:59:36.052
<i>Don't be texting, don't be doing
any of that. All right, just...</i>

01:59:36.127 --> 01:59:40.598
<i>You're Obi-Wan You're
centered, patient. Right?</i>

01:59:40.674 --> 01:59:42.847
<i>You watch three cars ahead,
two behind.</i>

01:59:42.926 --> 01:59:45.349
<i>Takes two bad drivers
to have an accident, okay?</i>

01:59:45.428 --> 01:59:46.429
Okay.

01:59:46.638 --> 01:59:50.359
<i>Listen, tell your sister to pick up her
phone or call me back or something.</i>

01:59:50.433 --> 01:59:51.901
<i>Okay.
All right, buddy.</i>

01:59:51.976 --> 01:59:54.104
<i>You have a good one.
Bye, Dad.</i>

01:59:56.523 --> 01:59:58.366
Hey, honey, take this
to your sister.

01:59:58.441 --> 01:59:59.909
Throw it in the truck, okay?

01:59:59.984 --> 02:00:01.782
Okay, I will.

02:00:02.445 --> 02:00:03.822
So where
is Sheena staying?

02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:05.327
At her friend Emily's.

02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:07.333
Is Emily a real person?

02:00:07.409 --> 02:00:08.661
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

02:00:08.743 --> 02:00:11.747
Yeah, she's a sophomore.
She has an apartment.

02:00:14.124 --> 02:00:15.967
Okay, this is in case
of emergency.

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:17.715
Don't spend it,
I want it back.

02:00:17.794 --> 02:00:19.637
Okay. Thanks.

02:00:21.172 --> 02:00:22.389
Did you do
your homework?

02:00:22.674 --> 02:00:24.893
Most of it, but I can
finish tomorrow night.

02:00:25.844 --> 02:00:28.518
Honey, 11th grade is really important
for college. Don't blow it.

02:00:28.596 --> 02:00:32.066
I know, I know. I mean, we're
going to UT and everything.

02:00:32.142 --> 02:00:33.485
Oh, don't you want
me to come?

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:36.609
"Come on, Sheena, road trip
with Mom!" I'll pay for gas.

02:00:36.688 --> 02:00:37.814

me like just another

extreme Mason
view of everything.

02:01:02.130 --> 02:01:04.474
Not at all!
I finally figured it out.

02:01:04.549 --> 02:01:07.393
It's like when they realized
it was gonna be too expensive

02:01:07.469 --> 02:01:11.349
to actually build
cyborgs and robots.

02:01:12.056 --> 02:01:13.603
I mean, the costs
of that were impossible.

02:01:13.683 --> 02:01:15.435
They decided to
just let humans

02:01:15.518 --> 02:01:17.612
turn themselves
into robots.

02:01:17.687 --> 02:01:19.280
That's what's
going on right now.

02:01:19.355 --> 02:01:20.481
Oh, right now?

02:01:20.565 --> 02:01:21.566
Yeah! I mean, why not?

02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:26.029
They're billions of us just laying
around, not really doing anything.

02:01:27.363 --> 02:01:28.740
We don't cost anything.

02:01:28.823 --> 02:01:33.545
We're even pretty good at self-maintenance
and reproducing constantly.

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:38.842
And as it turns out, we're
already biologically programmed

02:01:38.917 --> 02:01:40.715
for our little
cyborg upgrades.

02:01:40.794 --> 02:01:42.421
How?
Seriously.

02:01:42.504 --> 02:01:44.973
I read this thing
the other day about how...

02:01:45.048 --> 02:01:47.767
When you hear
that ding on your inbox,

02:01:47.842 --> 02:01:50.561
you get like a dopamine
rush in your brain.

02:01:50.637 --> 02:01:52.310
It's like we're being
chemically rewarded

02:01:52.388 --> 02:01:54.937
for allowing ourselves
to be brainwashed.

02:01:55.433 --> 02:01:58.812
How evil is that?
We're fucked.

02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:01.990
(SCOFFS) So you deleting your Facebook
page is gonna change all that?

02:02:03.399 --> 02:02:06.323
Remember when Trevor deleted
his Facebook page last year

02:02:06.402 --> 02:02:08.279
and everyone just hated him?

02:02:08.363 --> 02:02:09.706
You made more fun
of him than anyone.

02:02:09.781 --> 02:02:11.624
I still make fun
of Trevor though.

02:02:13.243 --> 02:02:16.417
It was like he was so pathetically
desperate for attention.

02:02:16.621 --> 02:02:18.123
Or to be different,
or something.

02:02:18.206 --> 02:02:21.585
That's just 'cause they did that lame
story about it in the school paper.

02:02:21.918 --> 02:02:23.591
And then he had to make
a big announcement about it

02:02:23.670 --> 02:02:25.263
when he came back
a month later.

02:02:25.338 --> 02:02:27.432
That's the thing, though, I'm
not doing it for attention.

02:02:27.507 --> 02:02:30.852
I just wanna try and not live
my life through a screen.

02:02:30.927 --> 02:02:34.852
I want some kind of
actual interaction.

02:02:34.931 --> 02:02:38.481
A real person, not just
the profile they put up.

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:41.233
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you saying something?

02:02:41.437 --> 02:02:43.064
Yeah, okay,
I know you're joking.

02:02:43.147 --> 02:02:44.347
But, I mean,
it's kind of true.

02:02:44.399 --> 02:02:47.369
You have been, you know, checking
your phone this whole time,

02:02:47.443 --> 02:02:48.820
so, what're you
really doing?

02:02:49.112 --> 02:02:52.207
You don't care what your friends
are up to on a Saturday afternoon,

02:02:52.282 --> 02:02:57.914
but you're also obviously not fully
experiencing my profound bitching.

02:02:57.996 --> 02:03:02.502
So, yeah, it's like everyone's just
stuck in like an in-between state.

02:03:02.584 --> 02:03:04.757
Not really
experiencing anything.

02:03:04.836 --> 02:03:07.089
It's not an experience,
it's just information.

02:03:07.881 --> 02:03:10.054
Look. For example,

02:03:10.133 --> 02:03:12.733
I just got the address of the club
where we're meeting them later,

02:03:12.802 --> 02:03:16.147
so we won't be wandering the streets
of Austin lost for an hour tonight.

02:03:16.222 --> 02:03:18.224
Thank you
very much, Facebook.

02:03:18.308 --> 02:03:20.026
And then I just texted
my mom back.

02:03:20.101 --> 02:03:22.524
Oh, that's groundbreaking.

02:03:22.604 --> 02:03:25.153
She hasn't seen you in,
like, 55 minutes?

02:03:26.941 --> 02:03:27.942
Oh...

02:03:28.151 --> 02:03:30.370

02:03:55.345 --> 02:03:57.393

she should let you in.

Awesome. Mmm.

Yeah, we met at a party
and it's been chill.

02:04:15.073 --> 02:04:17.121
Yeah, he seems cool.
Yeah, he is.

02:04:17.867 --> 02:04:19.907

Cool. SAMANTHA: Yeah.

02:04:20.119 --> 02:04:21.416
What does he study?

He's studying history and Italian,
I think, his minor, yeah.

02:04:27.001 --> 02:04:28.969
Does he wanna
teach Italian?

02:04:29.379 --> 02:04:31.222
I think he's still
figuring stuff out.

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:32.389
Yeah.
He'll figure it out.

02:04:32.465 --> 02:04:35.093
He's smart.
Smart, yeah.

02:04:35.259 --> 02:04:37.353
So, where are you thinking about
living when you come here?

02:04:37.428 --> 02:04:39.180
Um, I'm not really sure yet.

at apartments tomorrow.

expecting me to live in a dorm.

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:49.240
But I'm paying
my way through college,

02:04:49.315 --> 02:04:51.659
so it doesn't
really matter that much.

your parents after you turn 18.

helping you financially.

if it's a coed dorm.

so many cute guys at once.

02:20:13.697 --> 02:20:14.994
WOMAN: Aw...

02:20:15.824 --> 02:20:17.792
So you broke up
with your girlfriend?

02:20:17.868 --> 02:20:19.791
Yeah, yeah, just recently.

02:20:19.870 --> 02:20:21.042
What was her name?

02:20:21.121 --> 02:20:23.340
Sheena.

02:20:23.749 --> 02:20:25.922
She's gonna go to
college with you'?

02:20:26.001 --> 02:20:27.344
No.
No?

02:20:27.377 --> 02:20:29.379
Hmm. She's staying in
this part of Texas.

02:20:29.463 --> 02:20:30.635
Okay.

02:20:30.714 --> 02:20:32.216
You need a ride
to college?

02:20:32.925 --> 02:20:34.097
(CHUCKLES)

02:20:35.093 --> 02:20:37.437
I just wanted to say hello
before you got out of here.

02:20:37.512 --> 02:20:39.606
You guys met before, haven't you?
Annie, Aunt Jen?

02:20:39.681 --> 02:20:41.183
Yeah, we met at, uh...

02:20:41.266 --> 02:20:42.768
Sam's graduation.
Oh, yeah.

02:20:42.851 --> 02:20:44.444
And with your little one.
Where is he?

02:20:44.519 --> 02:20:46.897
Oh, he's at home.

02:20:46.980 --> 02:20:48.980
Remember? He was such a
pain in Sam's thing that...

02:20:49.024 --> 02:20:50.901
I would love to see him.

02:20:50.984 --> 02:20:53.032
We have a special weekend
this weekend, so...

02:20:53.153 --> 02:20:55.326
I'm so glad you
found her, I really am.

02:20:55.405 --> 02:20:57.533
You've got him at
a good time, I think.

02:20:57.616 --> 02:20:59.459
I think so, too.
Yeah.

02:20:59.534 --> 02:21:00.751
It's good to see you two.

02:21:00.827 --> 02:21:01.953
Nice to see you,
too, Jen.

02:21:02.037 --> 02:21:03.414
So proud of your boy.

02:21:03.497 --> 02:21:05.374
Yeah. Yeah,
we all are.

02:21:08.543 --> 02:21:10.796
She's a bitch and a half.
(LAUGHING)

02:21:12.506 --> 02:21:13.553
UNCLE STEVE: You got to
remember, you're going

02:21:13.632 --> 02:21:15.054
to college, though,
all right?

02:21:15.133 --> 02:21:18.103
And if you're anything
like me or your old man,

02:21:18.178 --> 02:21:20.476
you're gonna be pulling
down some serious wool.

02:21:20.555 --> 02:21:22.478
You're gonna be tapping
some masterful gap.

02:21:22.557 --> 02:21:24.104
You're gonna be doing
some good work out there.

02:21:24.184 --> 02:21:26.562
Think about it. Awful lot
of flowers in that bouquet.

02:21:26.812 --> 02:21:28.155
But you got to
do me a favor.

02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:30.310
You're going to be vulnerable
this summer, all right?

02:21:30.399 --> 02:21:33.403
Remember to use protection
during breakup sex.

02:21:33.735 --> 02:21:34.736
(CHUCKLES)

02:21:35.404 --> 02:21:37.907
This guy knows exactly of which I speak.
(CHUCKLES)

02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:40.584
Look what
happened to him. Voila'.

02:21:40.742 --> 02:21:42.085
Steven.
(LAUGHS)

02:21:43.412 --> 02:21:44.914
Cheers.

02:21:46.581 --> 02:21:47.707
It's not that simple.

02:21:47.791 --> 02:21:50.465
(CHANTING) Four more years.
Four more years.

02:21:51.003 --> 02:21:52.630
I'm just saying.

02:21:55.424 --> 02:21:57.677
(YAWNS) Do y'all recycle?
Should I...

02:21:57.759 --> 02:21:59.011
I have one started there.

02:21:59.094 --> 02:22:01.313
Oh, yeah, right. Great.

02:22:05.017 --> 02:22:07.395
Am I your only ex at this party?
(CHUCKLES)

02:22:07.894 --> 02:22:10.773
Yes. I'm not your
only wife here, though.

02:22:13.108 --> 02:22:14.360
Yeah.

02:22:16.778 --> 02:22:19.907
Can you believe they're
both out of high school'?

02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:22.789
No. No, I can't.

02:22:25.287 --> 02:22:28.791
You did a great job with
both of them, by the way.

02:22:29.291 --> 02:22:31.214
Thanks for saying that.

02:22:31.835 --> 02:22:33.052
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

02:22:33.128 --> 02:22:34.345
Well, it's true.

02:22:34.838 --> 02:22:36.215
Thank you.

02:22:37.966 --> 02:22:39.593
You're doing it
all over again, huh?

02:22:39.676 --> 02:22:41.599
I know, I know, right?
(CHUCKLES)

02:22:42.262 --> 02:22:45.983
It's gonna be 15 years
till I have an empty nest.

02:22:46.475 --> 02:22:47.476
Hmm.

02:22:47.601 --> 02:22:50.980
But I'd love to pitch in,
help with this, if I could.

02:22:51.063 --> 02:22:52.906
I mean, it's so great
that you did this.

02:22:52.981 --> 02:22:55.075
Can I just
give you a little?

02:22:55.650 --> 02:22:56.867
I'd appreciate it
if I could.

02:22:56.943 --> 02:22:58.536
Sure. Yeah.

02:22:58.612 --> 02:23:00.080
But I don't
have any cash.

02:23:00.155 --> 02:23:03.625
(LAUGHS) Oh, I know, it's in Annie's purse.
I'll be right back.

02:23:04.493 --> 02:23:05.915
(SIGHS)

02:23:06.369 --> 02:23:07.871
(WARMING UP INSTRUMENTS)

02:23:10.832 --> 02:23:13.585
So it sucks. I mean, the guy's
a college lacrosse player.

02:23:13.668 --> 02:23:15.090
What are you gonna do?

02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:17.423
She didn't even
like sports.

02:23:17.506 --> 02:23:18.849
You want a beer?

02:23:18.924 --> 02:23:20.141
No, that's all right.

02:23:20.217 --> 02:23:21.719
You can have one.
It's okay.

02:23:22.219 --> 02:23:24.267
Yeah, well,
for what it's worth,

02:23:24.346 --> 02:23:28.522
we've all been through the exact
same thing at one point or another.

02:23:29.142 --> 02:23:31.816
It's not the same, though. I
mean, you never got to know her.

02:23:31.895 --> 02:23:34.569
No, I know, I know.
It's not the same.

02:23:35.232 --> 02:23:37.280
I just don't know
what I did wrong.

02:23:37.359 --> 02:23:39.657
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, man.

02:23:40.821 --> 02:23:42.744
Hey.
Hey, Mason.

02:23:42.823 --> 02:23:45.667
We're up here raiding the green room.
Hope that's okay.

02:23:45.742 --> 02:23:46.834
That's totally cool.

02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:47.911
All right.

02:23:48.286 --> 02:23:49.538
(CLICKS TONGUE)

02:23:51.206 --> 02:23:53.334
Wow! Is that MJ?

02:23:53.416 --> 02:23:55.009
Uh-huh, right?
(CHUCKLING)

02:23:55.293 --> 02:23:56.886
Unbelievable.

02:23:57.671 --> 02:24:00.049
Well, we just decided to come a
little early, check you out.

02:24:00.132 --> 02:24:02.510
That's cool man, let me finish up.
I'll be up in a minute.

02:24:02.592 --> 02:24:05.436
All right. I guarantee you,
you didn't do anything wrong.

02:24:06.012 --> 02:24:08.106
These high school love
things, they never work out.

02:24:08.181 --> 02:24:09.353
Here, come here.

02:24:09.432 --> 02:24:12.732
I mean, everybody’s just
changing so much, you know'?

02:24:12.811 --> 02:24:16.315
The odds of two young people staying
on the same wavelength are...

02:24:16.439 --> 02:24:19.033
Yeah, but still... Look,
and I also guarantee you

02:24:19.109 --> 02:24:20.452
that every day
of your life

02:24:20.527 --> 02:24:22.575
that you spend crying
over some silly girl

02:24:22.654 --> 02:24:25.498
is a complete
waste of time.

02:24:25.574 --> 02:24:27.121
She wasn't
a silly girl, though.

02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:29.248
I mean,
she's a serious person.

02:24:29.327 --> 02:24:31.170
And I really
thought we were...

02:24:31.246 --> 02:24:32.372
What?

02:24:32.455 --> 02:24:34.423
(SIGHS)
I don't know.

02:24:34.791 --> 02:24:38.591
Here's the truth. Women are
never satisfied, okay?

02:24:38.712 --> 02:24:40.552
They're always looking
to potentially trade up,

02:24:40.589 --> 02:24:42.011
and that's,
I'm sorry to say,

02:24:42.090 --> 02:24:44.434
what I think has happened to
you, my fine-feathered friend.

02:24:44.509 --> 02:24:46.011
What does that even mean?

02:24:46.094 --> 02:24:49.519
It means don't hand over the controls
to your self-esteem to Sheila.

02:24:49.598 --> 02:24:50.895
Sheena.
All right.

02:24:50.974 --> 02:24:52.851
It means you are
responsible for you,

02:24:52.934 --> 02:24:55.858
not your girlfriend, not
your mom, not me, you.

02:24:55.937 --> 02:24:58.360
And if you truly
take care of you,

02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:01.239
you will be amazed at
how much girls like Sheena

02:25:01.318 --> 02:25:03.662
start lining up
at your front door.

02:25:04.279 --> 02:25:05.326
Great.

02:25:05.864 --> 02:25:08.538
You just gotta separate yourself
from the pack in some way.

02:25:08.617 --> 02:25:12.542
Excel at something, you know, and
then you have your pick of the litter

02:25:12.621 --> 02:25:14.999
when the front-runner hussies
start sniffing around.

02:25:15.081 --> 02:25:17.630
(CHUCKLES) So what you're saying
is I should take up lacrosse.

02:25:18.126 --> 02:25:19.548
Exactly.

02:25:19.628 --> 02:25:21.471
Or you could,
you know, start a band.

02:25:21.671 --> 02:25:25.471
Worked for me a long time ago. I
think it's still working for Jimmy.

02:25:25.592 --> 02:25:28.186
(CHUCKLES) Or you just
keep taking pictures.

02:25:28.637 --> 02:25:31.015
She hated the pictures
I took of her.

02:25:31.181 --> 02:25:32.899
I'm sick to death
of her, okay?

02:25:32.974 --> 02:25:36.274
I only met her a few times, and
yes, she was cute, all right,

02:25:36.353 --> 02:25:39.027
but truth be told, I always
thought she was a little bit...

02:25:39.105 --> 02:25:41.199
You know, a little
bit too square for you.

02:25:41.274 --> 02:25:43.743
You know,
not quite the same vibe.

02:25:43.818 --> 02:25:44.865
You really thought that?

02:25:44.945 --> 02:25:46.697
On some subtle,
lower level.

02:25:47.197 --> 02:25:50.542
I mean, I wasn't surprised

02:25:50.617 --> 02:25:54.838
when it turned out she was interested in
some Knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?

02:25:54.913 --> 02:25:59.760
I mean, bottom line is, it's all
timing with these things, you know.

02:26:00.252 --> 02:26:02.471
I mean,
take your mom and me.

02:26:02.545 --> 02:26:05.515
I think I probably
turned into the boring,

02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:07.308
castrated guy
she wanted me to be

02:26:07.425 --> 02:26:09.598
(CHUCKLES) 15, 20
years ago, you know?

02:26:09.678 --> 02:26:11.931
I'm not saying she was wrong
to be pissed, I'm not.

02:26:12.013 --> 02:26:13.606
I'm just saying
that she could've been

02:26:13.682 --> 02:26:15.559
a little more patient,
little more forgiving.

02:26:15.642 --> 02:26:18.270
Would've saved me that
parade of drunken assholes.

02:26:20.563 --> 02:26:22.531
(CLICKS TONGUE)
(CHUCKLES)

02:26:27.487 --> 02:26:28.704
So, what's the point?

02:26:30.407 --> 02:26:31.533
Of what?

02:26:32.492 --> 02:26:35.041
I don't know,
any of this. Everything.

02:26:36.288 --> 02:26:39.087
Everything? (CHUCKLES)
What's the point?

02:26:39.165 --> 02:26:41.714
I mean,
I sure as shit don't know.

02:26:42.294 --> 02:26:44.046
Neither does
anybody else, okay?

02:26:44.129 --> 02:26:46.723
We're all just
winging it, you know?

02:26:47.090 --> 02:26:48.808
The good news is
you're feeling stuff.

02:26:48.883 --> 02:26:51.636
And you've got to
hold on to that.

02:26:52.095 --> 02:26:55.269
You do. I mean, you get older
and you don't feel as much.

02:26:55.348 --> 02:26:57.100
Your skin gets tougher.

02:26:57.183 --> 02:26:58.685
The point is those
pictures you took,

02:26:58.768 --> 02:27:02.648
thousands of submissions from all
over the state, and you won.

02:27:03.106 --> 02:27:04.904
Well, I got silver.

02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:07.277
(CHUCKLING) And nine other people did, too.
I'm gonna kill you.

02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:09.704
I'm trying to tell you
that I believe in you, Mason.

02:27:09.779 --> 02:27:11.122
I think you're really special,

02:27:11.197 --> 02:27:13.575
and if some girl doesn't see
that, then fuck her, you know.

02:27:15.243 --> 02:27:18.543
JIMMY: Hey, this next one of 'em goes
out to a young man in the house.

02:27:18.663 --> 02:27:21.667
Whoo-hoo! Known him since
he was just a small boy.

02:27:21.875 --> 02:27:26.346
Now he's all graduated from high
school and making me feel old.

02:27:26.421 --> 02:27:27.673
(BOTH LAUGH)

02:27:27.756 --> 02:27:30.350
Happy high school
graduation, Mason.

02:27:31.593 --> 02:27:33.436
(PLAYING ROCK MUSIC)

02:27:57.786 --> 02:27:59.129
Thank you.

02:27:59.913 --> 02:28:03.543
Okay, guys, let's be clear. We're gonna
break this into four categories.

02:28:03.625 --> 02:28:05.878
One, anything you want to
keep from your childhood

02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:07.257
and you're taking with you.

02:28:07.337 --> 02:28:11.387
Two, throwing away.
Three, donating.

02:28:11.674 --> 02:28:13.893
And four, whatever you
want to try to sell

02:28:13.968 --> 02:28:15.390
at the garage sale
next weekend,

02:28:15.470 --> 02:28:17.723
whatever we don't sell,
we're donating.

02:28:18.306 --> 02:28:22.231
Doesn't the apartment have like an
attic, or storage or something?

02:28:22.602 --> 02:28:24.900
No. You're missing the point.

02:28:25.355 --> 02:28:28.154
We're not gonna drag a bunch of
crap to Mom's tiny apartment.

02:28:28.858 --> 02:28:30.735
Can't believe
we're moving again.

02:28:30.819 --> 02:28:32.162
No, I'm moving.

02:28:32.237 --> 02:28:34.990
You moved two years ago. You
have an apartment in Austin.

02:28:35.323 --> 02:28:37.246
Mason is
moving in the fall.

02:28:37.659 --> 02:28:39.206
I'm done.

02:28:39.285 --> 02:28:41.458
This'll be great for me.
I'll have all these options.

02:28:41.538 --> 02:28:43.165
I could take a sabbatical.

02:28:43.248 --> 02:28:45.626
I could get some writing done,
try to get published.

02:28:45.708 --> 02:28:47.756
What about Christmas, though?
What are we gonna do?

02:28:47.836 --> 02:28:49.713
I'm not sharing
a room with him.

02:28:49.796 --> 02:28:51.469
One of you will
sleep on the couch,

02:28:51.548 --> 02:28:53.676
and we'll use that
blow-up mattress.

02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:56.302
How am I supposed
to do my laundry?

02:28:57.178 --> 02:29:00.102
Sam, I'm gently
pushing you out of the nest.

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:05.024
And on your way down, you may
magically find some quarters

02:29:05.103 --> 02:29:07.697
that you use to do laundry
in your own apartment.

02:29:08.022 --> 02:29:11.367
Come on!
You guys are adults!

02:29:11.609 --> 02:29:15.364
You need to take some responsibility.
Now, what do you want?

02:29:17.031 --> 02:29:19.079
I'm gonna get
the veggie burger.

02:29:19.159 --> 02:29:21.253
I'm not having anything,
not hungry.

02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:23.747
What's wrong with you?

02:29:24.038 --> 02:29:25.381
I'm sick.

02:29:26.166 --> 02:29:29.010
What is it, your head?
Do you have a fever?

02:29:29.252 --> 02:29:31.254
She's pregnant.
(CHUCKLES)

02:29:32.005 --> 02:29:35.680
No. To be honest, I drank
way too much last night.

02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:37.768
You weren't driving, were you?
No, no.

02:29:38.303 --> 02:29:41.227
Cary's back home, too,
and we just hung out.

02:29:41.306 --> 02:29:45.106
You know, peach Smirnoffs,
they just go down so easy.

02:29:45.185 --> 02:29:48.189
No, no. Hey,
that's not an excuse.

02:29:48.271 --> 02:29:50.023
You can still pack boxes.

02:29:50.106 --> 02:29:53.030
These people want to move in
as soon as possible.

02:29:53.109 --> 02:29:55.612
Hi, guys.
I'm Ernesto, how are you?

02:29:56.905 --> 02:29:58.248
You probably
don't remember me,

02:29:58.323 --> 02:30:00.451
but I worked on your
septic line years ago.

02:30:00.533 --> 02:30:01.580
Oh, yeah.

02:30:02.368 --> 02:30:04.416
Believe it or not,
you changed my life.

02:30:04.496 --> 02:30:06.715
You told me that day
that I was smart

02:30:06.789 --> 02:30:08.757
and that I should
go to school.

02:30:09.167 --> 02:30:11.966
I took your advice. I signed
up for English classes,

02:30:12.086 --> 02:30:14.088
and then a year later,
I went to community college

02:30:14.172 --> 02:30:15.372
and I got my
Associates degree,

02:30:15.423 --> 02:30:17.517
and I'm working on my
bachelor's now at Texas State.

02:30:17.592 --> 02:30:19.094
And also one of
the managers here.

02:30:19.302 --> 02:30:20.428
That's great.

02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:23.227
It's good to see you,
because I really wanted

02:30:23.306 --> 02:30:25.934
a chance to
thank you for that.

02:30:26.017 --> 02:30:28.486
Gracias. It really
meant a lot to me.

02:30:29.562 --> 02:30:33.066
Don't worry about lunch. It's on me.
It's the least I can do.

02:30:33.775 --> 02:30:36.619
You guys should listen to her.
She's a smart lady.

02:30:37.278 --> 02:30:38.621
Thank you.

02:30:52.961 --> 02:30:54.241
Isn't that kind
of crazy, though,

02:30:54.254 --> 02:30:55.722
that a computer
knows who you are

02:30:55.797 --> 02:30:58.550
from just 20 questions
off a form?

02:30:58.633 --> 02:31:01.853
I guess there are really only like
eight types of people in the world.

02:31:01.928 --> 02:31:04.101
I mean, there are subsets
like male and female,

02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:08.026
but apparently we're not as unique
<i>as</i> we want to think we are.

02:31:08.101 --> 02:31:10.149
Have you even
talked to this guy yet?

02:31:10.311 --> 02:31:13.736
No, but we've been trading emails.
He seems pretty cool.

02:31:13.815 --> 02:31:16.785
He's studying
literature and anthropology

02:31:16.859 --> 02:31:20.079
and he's way into Bright Eyes,
so that's not so bad.

02:31:20.238 --> 02:31:22.240
But, anyways, he was
telling me about how

02:31:22.323 --> 02:31:26.078
the system they use for assigning
roommates is kinda spooky.

02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:30.210
The freshman satisfaction rate for
new roommates used to be like 60%,

02:31:30.290 --> 02:31:33.294
and now it's 100,
just 'cause of the computer.

02:31:33.710 --> 02:31:36.884
Well, sounds like he'll be
a good roommate, then.

02:31:37.630 --> 02:31:39.928
Yeah. But we
pretty much decided

02:31:40.008 --> 02:31:42.261
that soon they won't even
need a questionnaire

02:31:42.343 --> 02:31:45.643
'cause they'll just let the
NSA scan your digital ghost

02:31:45.722 --> 02:31:47.690
and they'll tell you
who your roommate is

02:31:47.765 --> 02:31:51.360
based on everything you've
ever said, written or clicked.

02:31:51.728 --> 02:31:54.777
Did you put this
in here again?

02:31:54.856 --> 02:31:56.779
(LAUGHS)
I don't want it.

02:31:56.858 --> 02:31:59.577
Come on, it's the first
picture you ever took.

02:32:00.695 --> 02:32:03.539
All the more reason to
leave it behind, right?

02:32:08.953 --> 02:32:10.500
(SOBBING)

02:32:19.922 --> 02:32:22.220
What?
Nothing.

02:32:22.342 --> 02:32:24.470
No, what is it?
It's nothing!

02:32:25.887 --> 02:32:26.934
Mom.

02:32:30.224 --> 02:32:32.773
This is the worst
day of my life.

02:32:33.269 --> 02:32:34.521
What're you talking about?

02:32:34.604 --> 02:32:35.821
I knew this day
was coming.

02:32:35.897 --> 02:32:37.097
I didn't know
you were gonna be

02:32:37.148 --> 02:32:38.900
so fuckin'
happy to be leaving.

02:32:40.068 --> 02:32:43.663
I mean, it's not that I'm that happy.
What do you expect?

02:32:44.238 --> 02:32:47.287
You know what I'm realizing? My
life is just gonna go, like that.

02:32:47.617 --> 02:32:49.585
This series of milestones.

02:32:49.744 --> 02:32:53.248
Getting married. Having kids.
Getting divorced.

02:32:53.414 --> 02:32:55.758
The time that we thought
you were dyslexic.

02:32:55.833 --> 02:32:57.380
When I taught you
how to ride a bike.

02:32:58.461 --> 02:33:01.681
Getting divorced again.
Getting my master's degree.

02:33:01.756 --> 02:33:03.599
Finally getting
the job I wanted.

02:33:03.675 --> 02:33:07.100
Sending Samantha off to college.
Sending you off to college.

02:33:07.428 --> 02:33:09.351
You know what's next'? Huh?

02:33:09.430 --> 02:33:11.432
It's my fuckin' funeral!

02:33:13.643 --> 02:33:15.611
Just go!
And leave my picture!

02:33:18.022 --> 02:33:21.617
Aren't you jumping ahead by,
like, 40 years or something?

02:33:24.445 --> 02:33:27.289
I just thought
there would be more.

02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:32.662
(SIGHS)

02:33:37.458 --> 02:33:39.085
(FOLK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

02:33:51.973 --> 02:33:53.646
(INCREASES VOLUME)

02:35:43.751 --> 02:35:44.843
Hey, you must be Mason.

02:35:45.044 --> 02:35:46.091
Yeah. Dalton, right?

02:35:46.212 --> 02:35:48.431
Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you.
Definitely.

02:35:48.506 --> 02:35:50.099
Are you cool with
this side of the room?

02:35:50.258 --> 02:35:51.305
Yeah.

02:35:51.384 --> 02:35:53.887
Got in this morning,
just moved my shit in, man.

02:35:53.970 --> 02:35:56.974
(CHUCKLES) Well, yeah, I don't care.
No worries.

02:35:57.056 --> 02:35:58.353
Cool. Can I help you
with anything, man?

02:35:58.432 --> 02:35:59.649
Any bags, any of that
stuff need brought in?

02:35:59.725 --> 02:36:03.195
I just got like one box left,
I packed pretty light.

02:36:03.271 --> 02:36:04.488
But I appreciate it.

02:36:04.564 --> 02:36:05.844
It's my pleasure, man.
Of course.

02:36:08.442 --> 02:36:11.286
Um... Are you going to
the orientation mixer thing?

02:36:12.488 --> 02:36:15.037
Orientation mixer thing?

02:36:15.116 --> 02:36:16.709
Fuck no, man,
I'm not going to that,

02:36:16.784 --> 02:36:17.956
and neither are you,
by the way.

02:36:17.994 --> 02:36:20.497
We got way better stuff to
be doing, dude. All right.

02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:21.877
You ready?
Yeah.

02:36:21.956 --> 02:36:24.209
Hey, Barb, this is my roommate Mason.
Mason, Barb.

02:36:24.292 --> 02:36:25.339
Hi.
BARB: Hey.

02:36:25.668 --> 02:36:26.760
You coming with us?

02:36:27.253 --> 02:36:28.300
Where're you going?

02:36:28.796 --> 02:36:30.719
Hiking. Yeah, man,
you should come.

02:36:30.798 --> 02:36:32.675
If we leave now we can catch the
late afternoon at Big Bend.

02:36:32.758 --> 02:36:33.850
You ever been before, man?

02:36:33.926 --> 02:36:35.644
Yeah, but not since
I was really little.

02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:39.975
Then all the more reason to come now, man.
That's why we're here, dude.

02:36:41.225 --> 02:36:43.523
Oh, Mason, this is
Nicole, Barb's roommate.

02:36:44.103 --> 02:36:45.150
Hey, what's up?

02:36:45.396 --> 02:36:47.740
Hi.
Mason, Nicole.

02:36:47.815 --> 02:36:48.816
So, you game?

02:36:50.067 --> 02:36:51.239
Sure.

02:36:51.861 --> 02:36:53.784
Here,
have the rest of this.

02:36:54.113 --> 02:36:57.208
Got it timed perfectly. It'll kick
in when we get in the mountains.

02:36:57.283 --> 02:36:58.910
Awesome. Let's go.

02:37:06.417 --> 02:37:08.169
MASON: Do they let you
major in that here?

02:37:08.252 --> 02:37:12.348
Well, it's not that serious here, so
I kinda train outside of university,

02:37:12.423 --> 02:37:15.393
but I'm taking all my basics like
History of Dance and all that.

02:37:15.468 --> 02:37:17.266
Nice.
Yeah.

02:37:17.762 --> 02:37:19.105
What do you teach?

02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:20.432
Oh, gosh.
(LAUGHS)

02:37:21.015 --> 02:37:24.189
Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop.
Wow...

02:37:24.727 --> 02:37:26.229
Which one's
your favorite?

02:37:26.312 --> 02:37:27.404
Tap.

02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:28.527
Yeah?
Yeah.

02:37:28.606 --> 02:37:32.952
You get to like make up all your
own sounds, and there's no rules.

02:37:33.027 --> 02:37:34.404
Just like
creative freedom.

02:37:34.487 --> 02:37:36.114
That's great.
Yeah.

02:37:36.197 --> 02:37:37.744
That's why I love
teaching it, 'cause,

02:37:37.823 --> 02:37:39.416
I don't know,
it's so beautiful to me,

02:37:39.492 --> 02:37:41.836
and it's kind of dying
away in this generation,

02:37:41.911 --> 02:37:43.311
so, to be a part
of bringing it back

02:37:43.329 --> 02:37:44.569
to the kids is
really rewarding.

02:37:44.580 --> 02:37:45.832
Right, keeps it going.
Yeah.

02:37:45.915 --> 02:37:46.916
How old are they?

02:37:47.041 --> 02:37:48.588
Six to eight.
Wow.

02:37:48.668 --> 02:37:52.298
Yeah. They have no fear, and
they're not self-conscious at all.

02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:54.428
They haven't reached
the awkward years yet.

02:37:54.548 --> 02:37:56.721
Yeah, not yet. It's coming.

crazy sometimes.

02:38:28.916 --> 02:38:30.463
He seems cool, though.

02:38:30.584 --> 02:38:33.258
Yeah. Yeah,
they're both really cool.

02:38:36.757 --> 02:38:38.555

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

02:38:40.594 --> 02:38:43.939
Great. Pretty great,
to be honest.

02:38:45.307 --> 02:38:46.604
Good.

you're hangin' out with us.

has unfolded before us

02:39:02.408 --> 02:39:06.129
so we could stand here and look
out and scream, "Fuck, yeah!"

(DALTON WHOOPING)

You know how everyone's always
saying, "Seize the moment"?

I don't know, I'm kinda thinking
it's the other way around.

02:39:23.637 --> 02:39:26.607
You know, like,
the moment seizes us.

02:39:26.682 --> 02:39:29.310
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

02:39:30.227 --> 02:39:33.606
It's constant.
The moment, it's just...

02:39:34.648 --> 02:39:37.652
It's like it's always
right now, you know?
