WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.766
Andy's coming back today.

00:04.141 --> 00:07.844
Andy's coming back today.
Ha!

00:09.180 --> 00:11.014
Andy's coming back today.

00:11.082 --> 00:13.383
David Wallace sent him
on an outward-bound

00:13.451 --> 00:15.251
wilderness adventure
for a whole month

00:15.319 --> 00:16.920
to make him more decisive
and confident.

00:16.987 --> 00:19.022
He sent his own son too.

00:19.090 --> 00:23.259
And the counselor said
they both grew up big time.

00:25.729 --> 00:28.698
How was my summer?
It was pretty mixed.

00:28.766 --> 00:31.501
I invented a new power drink
made of beet run-off.

00:31.569 --> 00:36.005
Mmm. Mmm!
So that's really good.

00:36.073 --> 00:40.543
But I got some disappointing
medical news.

00:40.611 --> 00:42.145
Mr. Schrute,
the results are in.

00:42.213 --> 00:45.081
- You're not the father.
- I told you.

00:47.451 --> 00:50.453
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!

00:50.521 --> 00:53.123
Oh, what a summer.

00:53.190 --> 00:55.391
An emotional roller coaster.

00:55.459 --> 00:58.128
I ran over a turtle
in the parking lot...

00:58.195 --> 00:59.462
[Whimpering]

00:59.530 --> 01:04.099
But then I saved him by gluing
his shell back together.

01:04.168 --> 01:06.302
But I'm not that good
at puzzles...

01:06.370 --> 01:08.404
Oh, that piece doesn't
go there.

01:08.472 --> 01:09.906
Shh.

01:09.974 --> 01:14.177
So I patched him with stuff
from around the office.

01:14.245 --> 01:17.514
But I couldn't get
the pieces to fit right.

01:17.581 --> 01:22.085
Then, one day, while I was
reaching for the glue,

01:22.153 --> 01:24.854
I crushed his shell again.

01:24.922 --> 01:28.791
But I rebuilt him even better
that time.

01:28.859 --> 01:34.764
But it turned out
the turtle was already dead.

01:34.832 --> 01:39.202
Probably when I ran over him
the first time.

01:39.270 --> 01:43.173
For us, um...
Nothing new, really.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.207
The kids are great.

01:44.275 --> 01:45.575
You are really good at modesty.

01:45.643 --> 01:47.644
She's a genius. She painted
this incredible mural

01:47.711 --> 01:48.945
in the kids' room.

01:49.013 --> 01:50.647
There's a hippo leading
a parade of 500 children...

01:50.714 --> 01:53.149
Okay, well, you had
that interesting thing.

01:53.217 --> 01:54.584
Oh... yeah.

01:54.652 --> 01:56.920
Yes, Jim's friend
is starting a new company

01:56.987 --> 01:58.721
based on this idea that Jim had

01:58.789 --> 02:00.089
when they were back in college.

02:00.157 --> 02:02.025
It's sports marketing,
basically,

02:02.092 --> 02:03.459
but the athletes are partners.

02:03.527 --> 02:04.961
And he wanted Jim
to be a partner too.

02:05.029 --> 02:07.797
In Philly, so...
that doesn't really work

02:07.865 --> 02:09.499
for the family.

02:09.567 --> 02:12.702
But watch this guy make
a billion dollars off my idea.

02:12.770 --> 02:14.904
He said if it takes off,
he's gonna buy us a new car.

02:14.972 --> 02:17.040
An Altima or better.

02:17.107 --> 02:18.975
Kelly Kapoor is gone.

02:19.043 --> 02:22.645
Her fiance, Ravi, was hired
as a Pediatrics Professor

02:22.713 --> 02:24.147
at Miami University.

02:24.215 --> 02:25.882
I don't need 'em anymore.

02:25.950 --> 02:28.518
I am going to Miami,
bee-yotches,

02:28.586 --> 02:31.854
to hang with Lebron James
and Gloria Estefan.

02:31.922 --> 02:35.458
Miami University, in Ohio.

02:35.526 --> 02:38.528
On her last day, Kelly was still
a little confused about it.

02:38.596 --> 02:44.000
- Enjoy the snow, losers.
- I'm so happy for you, Kelly.

02:44.068 --> 02:45.935
Shortly after Kelly left,
Ryan quit

02:46.003 --> 02:48.471
and also moved to Ohio,

02:48.539 --> 02:50.373
for what he claimed were
unrelated reasons.

02:50.441 --> 02:52.408
I've actually done a lot
of market research,

02:52.476 --> 02:55.011
and it turns out that
Southwestern Ohio is going to be

02:55.079 --> 02:56.779
the next Silicon Valley.

02:56.847 --> 02:58.181
They call it
the Silicon Prairie.

02:58.249 --> 03:03.686
It's a big university town,
and, uh...

03:03.754 --> 03:06.055
It's not garbage,
it's my clothes.

03:06.123 --> 03:10.760
And that was our summer.

03:10.828 --> 03:14.230
- We good?
- Yeah. Thanks.

03:14.298 --> 03:15.531
Don't you guys have everything?

03:15.599 --> 03:18.401
I mean, it's just
a paper company.

03:18.469 --> 03:20.703
Yeah, well, we're more
following you guys

03:20.771 --> 03:22.272
to see how you turn out.

03:22.339 --> 03:23.873
Oh, yeah, I guess we were

03:23.941 --> 03:26.009
kind of dramatic
in the beginning.

03:26.076 --> 03:30.046
Well, I don't think anything's
gonna change in our lives now.

03:30.114 --> 03:32.282
With work and two kids,
there's just...

03:32.349 --> 03:34.250
Nothing interesting's
gonna happen to us

03:34.318 --> 03:37.820
for a long, long time.

Andy's coming back today.

04:06.483 --> 04:08.351
Hey, uh, does anybody know

04:08.419 --> 04:09.519
where we throw these out?

04:09.586 --> 04:10.920
Oh, my God.

04:10.988 --> 04:13.790
- It's called a garbage can.
- Helpless.

04:13.857 --> 04:16.625
There's two new guys
back there with me now.

04:16.694 --> 04:19.796
They're in their 20s,
and we really get along.

04:19.863 --> 04:21.831
Looking good.

04:21.899 --> 04:25.702
Just three single guys...
getting into trouble.

04:25.769 --> 04:27.804
They're like the new
Jim and Dwight.

04:27.871 --> 04:29.972
[Chuckles]

04:30.040 --> 04:33.309
Oh, yes, yes.
I see that. Perfect.

04:33.377 --> 04:36.045
Hey, new Jim,
come sit on my face.

04:36.113 --> 04:39.515
No, thank you.
My name's Pete.

04:39.583 --> 04:43.052
No, Pete is not the new Jim.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.454
The only thing
we have in common is that

04:44.521 --> 04:47.023
neither of us wants to sit
on Meredith's face.

04:47.091 --> 04:48.791
And if that makes him
the new Jim,

04:48.859 --> 04:51.994
then every human being
in the world is the new Jim.

04:52.062 --> 04:54.630
Andy's here! Old Dwight,
new Dwight, Andy's here.

04:54.698 --> 04:57.467
New Jim, Tuna, Andy's here.
Pam, he's here.

04:57.534 --> 05:00.703
[Squeals]
Hey! Ahh.

05:00.771 --> 05:04.874
Wow, I thought about this place
a lot when I was on solo.

05:04.942 --> 05:07.543
Three days on a mountain,
it'll change you.

05:07.611 --> 05:10.046
[Chuckles]
The things we think we need.

05:10.114 --> 05:12.415
Clocks.
Yeah, right.

05:12.483 --> 05:14.717
It sounds amazing.
Tell us all about it.

05:14.785 --> 05:15.818
What are you still doing here?

05:15.886 --> 05:18.554
Wonderful, thanks.

05:18.622 --> 05:21.324
You know, I had this
really funny dream

05:21.392 --> 05:23.526
during outward bound
that you died.

05:23.594 --> 05:26.496
[Laughs] Brilliant.

05:26.563 --> 05:29.065
See me in my office later.

05:29.133 --> 05:31.601
The new guys.
All right.

05:31.668 --> 05:34.203
- Clark and, um...
- Pete.

05:34.271 --> 05:35.638
Da da da da...

05:35.706 --> 05:37.173
In Outward Bound,
it was all about nicknames.

05:37.241 --> 05:39.108
They called me Iceman.

05:39.176 --> 05:40.276
You will be called "Plop."

05:40.344 --> 05:42.078
What... Why?

05:42.146 --> 05:43.246
'Cause you're always
taking dumps.

05:43.313 --> 05:44.380
No, I'm not.

05:44.448 --> 05:45.481
Come on, everybody defecates.

05:45.549 --> 05:47.884
Relax, Plop.
You will be called "Fart"

05:47.951 --> 05:50.019
- because you fart all the time.
- I love it.

05:50.087 --> 05:51.621
Actually, Andy,
we call this one

05:51.688 --> 05:53.089
"Dwight Jr."

05:53.157 --> 05:54.757
No, I prefer "Fart."

05:54.825 --> 05:57.260
No, Dwight Jr.
Infinitely better.

05:57.327 --> 05:58.428
You guys look exactly alike.

05:58.495 --> 06:01.130
Dwight, go stand next to him.

06:01.198 --> 06:02.465
- This is insane.
- I don't see it.

06:02.533 --> 06:04.600
I don't either.
I don't either.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.536
Whoa.
[lmitates explosion]

06:06.603 --> 06:09.338
Mind blown.
It's like father and son.

06:12.643 --> 06:14.977
It's...
[Sighs]

06:15.045 --> 06:17.780
Dwight, you cool if we
call him Dwight Jr.?

06:17.848 --> 06:20.950
Yes.
Yes, I am.

06:25.155 --> 06:26.088
That's okay.

06:26.156 --> 06:30.393
- Dwight Jr.
- Ha.

06:30.461 --> 06:31.894
In a way, it's like
I have a son.

06:31.962 --> 06:33.463
And who knows?
Maybe some day

06:33.530 --> 06:36.499
they'll hire someone who looks
like a younger version of him.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.434
And then I'll have a grandson.

06:38.502 --> 06:41.170
Well, I need to give
my cat up for adoption.

06:41.238 --> 06:43.606
- Mmm.
- The one who uses the doorbell,

06:43.674 --> 06:45.141
or the one
with the Mexican hat,

06:45.209 --> 06:47.276
or the one
with the rain galoshes,

06:47.344 --> 06:49.078
or the one that you let
go around naked?

06:49.146 --> 06:50.947
Angela's cats are cute.

06:51.014 --> 06:54.217
So cute that you just want
to eat 'em.

06:54.284 --> 06:57.620
But you can't eat cats.

06:57.688 --> 07:01.023
You can't eat cats, Kevin.

07:01.091 --> 07:05.094
No, the one with the long hair
and the denim pants... Comstock.

07:05.162 --> 07:06.295
- Oh.
- Okay, look.

07:06.363 --> 07:08.664
He's such a special kitty.

07:08.732 --> 07:11.100
I just want to find him
a good home.

07:11.168 --> 07:14.470
[Cheesy pop music playing]

07:14.538 --> 07:18.941
He loves those pants.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.710
I'll take him.

07:20.777 --> 07:22.345
Please.
After the turtle?

07:22.412 --> 07:25.815
I am enormously proud
of what I did for that turtle!

07:25.883 --> 07:28.451
Oscar. Oscar.
Will you take him?

07:28.519 --> 07:29.986
No, I'm a dog person.

07:30.053 --> 07:32.321
If you pray enough,

07:32.389 --> 07:35.124
you can change yourself
into a cat person.

07:35.192 --> 07:37.159
Those guys always
turn back, Angela.

07:37.227 --> 07:39.262
David, outward bound
was incredible.

07:39.329 --> 07:41.397
I was the best at slacklining.

07:41.465 --> 07:42.732
I ate a worm.

07:42.799 --> 07:43.933
Glad to hear it.

07:44.001 --> 07:46.135
You sound really confident
and decisive.

07:46.203 --> 07:48.037
[Knock on door]
Hey, you wanted to see me?

07:48.105 --> 07:50.473
Yeah.
I gotta go, David.

07:50.541 --> 07:51.741
Why is Nellie still here?

07:51.808 --> 07:53.242
You can only fire Nellie
for cause.

07:53.310 --> 07:56.078
Hmm. Then I will
make up a cause.

07:56.146 --> 07:58.180
Except you just told me
you were gonna make it up.

07:58.248 --> 08:00.583
Now, if she sues,
I have to testify against you.

08:00.651 --> 08:02.985
Then forget
I just told you that.

08:03.053 --> 08:05.855
I can't. I took a course
at the Weintraub Memory Academy.

08:05.923 --> 08:08.357
Sat next to this woman
named Beverly Brook.

08:08.425 --> 08:10.459
She had a Greek salad
for lunch.

08:10.527 --> 08:11.561
See what I mean?

08:11.628 --> 08:14.664
Now I know why Michael
hated you so much.

08:14.731 --> 08:16.566
No, he didn't.

08:21.805 --> 08:24.941
Good boy.
Getting big and strong.

08:25.008 --> 08:26.609
Snack foods!

08:26.677 --> 08:29.178
Yep.
[Both chuckle]

08:29.246 --> 08:30.580
Body by cheez-it.

08:30.647 --> 08:34.216
Ah, humor.
I have it too.

08:34.284 --> 08:36.852
Oh, boy,
I got a couple of tickets

08:36.919 --> 08:38.988
to The Slayer concert
ten months from now.

08:39.056 --> 08:40.056
You interested?

08:40.123 --> 08:43.259
I think I'm busy that night.

08:43.327 --> 08:44.460
Oh, or I would.

08:44.528 --> 08:46.362
Mmm, okay, well,

08:46.430 --> 08:48.731
we're both just kind of learning
as we go, aren't we?

08:48.799 --> 08:50.433
Learning what?

08:50.500 --> 08:55.204
Just... how this is gonna be.
You know.

08:55.272 --> 08:57.807
You have a beautiful
round head.

08:57.874 --> 08:59.976
Okay.

09:00.043 --> 09:02.244
So what kind of farming
you into, huh?

09:02.312 --> 09:05.881
More of a fruit man
or a root man?

09:05.949 --> 09:10.419
Hey, is this... is this code
for, like, gay stuff?

09:10.487 --> 09:11.754
'Cause if so,
that's totally fine.

09:11.822 --> 09:13.222
Like, I'm fine with it.

09:13.290 --> 09:15.825
But you know, you should know
that I'm into the ladies.

09:15.892 --> 09:19.428
Spoken like a true root man.

09:19.496 --> 09:21.030
Hey, you know,
if you're ever swamped,

09:21.098 --> 09:23.766
I can make
some sales calls for you.

09:23.834 --> 09:26.202
- My calls?
- So could you give me

09:26.269 --> 09:27.804
a list of all your clients,
or just the leads

09:27.871 --> 09:29.105
that you haven't had time
to pursue yet?

09:29.172 --> 09:30.439
You want a list of my clients?

09:30.507 --> 09:31.641
You want my leads?

09:31.708 --> 09:33.175
Yeah, I'll just
give it a glance.

09:33.243 --> 09:34.644
- Okay.
- I'll give it a read.

09:34.711 --> 09:35.978
Yeah, with my leads,
and stuff like that.

09:36.046 --> 09:37.179
Yeah.

09:37.247 --> 09:38.681
'Cause you're interested
in going into sales.

09:38.749 --> 09:39.749
- I am.
- Wow, that's great.

09:39.816 --> 09:41.751
- Yeah.
- That's great.

09:41.818 --> 09:43.953
Okay, good.
Let's talk about that, okay?

09:44.021 --> 09:47.023
- Okay.
- You're not getting my clients.

09:47.090 --> 09:50.159
Nice try.

09:50.227 --> 09:52.728
Paranoid?
I'm not familiar with the word.

09:52.796 --> 09:54.397
And I really don't have time
to learn new words

09:54.464 --> 09:55.631
right now, okay?

09:55.699 --> 09:57.833
A pudgy 22-year-old
is trying to take my job.

10:00.836 --> 10:02.570
Jim, get ready for the
battle of your life.

10:02.637 --> 10:04.071
Done. Explain.

10:04.139 --> 10:07.041
The new guys... Dwight Jr.
Is after my job.

10:07.108 --> 10:09.577
Yeah, there is a shark
hiding inside

10:09.644 --> 10:10.744
that adorable little cherub.

10:10.812 --> 10:12.379
Oh, now I get
what Pete was talking about

10:12.447 --> 10:13.647
at the sales meeting yesterday.

10:13.715 --> 10:16.817
Wait, sales...
What sales meeting?

10:16.885 --> 10:17.952
The new guys called one.

10:18.019 --> 10:19.386
The new guys called
a sales meeting?

10:19.454 --> 10:21.822
Clark ended the whole thing
with a karate demonstration.

10:21.890 --> 10:23.557
Did you know there was
a belt above black?

10:23.625 --> 10:25.626
There's no belt above black.

10:25.694 --> 10:28.195
- Is there a belt above black?
- You should ask him.

10:28.263 --> 10:29.663
It's a color
you would never expect.

10:33.235 --> 10:35.769
Too easy.
[Chuckles]

10:35.837 --> 10:39.073
Attention, everyone.
Comstock is still available.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.709
Oscar has been flirting
with adopting him,

10:41.776 --> 10:44.011
but still hasn't given me
a definite yes or no.

10:44.079 --> 10:46.447
- Definitely no.
- Fine.

10:46.514 --> 10:48.115
For any interested candidates,

10:48.183 --> 10:50.217
I will be conducting
20-minute interviews.

10:50.285 --> 10:52.987
My ideal situation would be

10:53.054 --> 10:55.689
an independently wealthy
cute couple

10:55.757 --> 10:57.458
with a strong commitment
to education.

10:57.525 --> 10:59.593
Black or white...
I'm fine with either.

10:59.661 --> 11:02.029
But not both.
Listen, you're in this,

11:02.097 --> 11:05.799
but you need to wow me, okay?

11:05.867 --> 11:07.134
I wanted to talk to you about

11:07.202 --> 11:09.136
our working relationship
this year.

11:09.204 --> 11:11.538
It's going to be terrible.

11:11.606 --> 11:13.641
Not necessarily.

11:13.708 --> 11:16.644
No, I'm going to make sure
that it is.

11:16.711 --> 11:19.046
And if it isn't, I will take
immediate action

11:19.114 --> 11:20.614
to rectify that.

11:20.682 --> 11:25.085
Now, I don't like
to throw around the "B" word,

11:25.153 --> 11:28.689
but I'm gonna be
a huge bitch to you.

11:30.358 --> 11:33.594
Now, this is called
slacklining.

11:33.662 --> 11:35.629
I set up the old slackline
to teach the office

11:35.697 --> 11:38.299
the skills of focus
and discipline.

11:38.366 --> 11:39.900
Or in the case
of certain individuals,

11:39.968 --> 11:43.904
the skills of humiliation
and looking really dumb.

11:43.972 --> 11:45.239
If you make it
all the way across,

11:45.307 --> 11:46.507
your confidence will soar.

11:46.574 --> 11:49.476
But if you Toby out...
Aah! Aah!

11:49.544 --> 11:51.912
Then you'll feel like
a real Nellie.

11:51.980 --> 11:54.114
How 'bout a hand?
Screw those guys.

11:54.182 --> 11:57.518
Now, these are my actual
outward bound counselors,

11:57.585 --> 11:58.652
Rafe and Feather.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.921
- Iceman.
- That's me.

12:00.989 --> 12:02.923
The powder is for
your protection.

12:02.991 --> 12:04.158
Feather has permanent
athlete's foot.

12:04.225 --> 12:06.627
Feather, show them
how you dance

12:06.695 --> 12:09.463
upon the line of slack.

12:11.433 --> 12:13.500
You, uh...
You a sports guy?

12:13.568 --> 12:17.371
- Sure. Uh, boxing, tennis.
- Oh.

12:17.439 --> 12:19.440
Any team sports?

12:19.507 --> 12:23.243
Nascar.
<i>The Amazing Race.</i>

12:23.311 --> 12:24.812
Phillies fan, though, right?

12:24.879 --> 12:26.180
You mean horses?

12:26.247 --> 12:29.149
No, like ba... baseball.
The baseball team.

12:29.217 --> 12:31.552
I like the Red Sox.
I'm from Vermont, so...

12:31.619 --> 12:35.489
Okay. Good talk.

12:35.557 --> 12:37.992
I have nothing in common
with Plop.

12:38.059 --> 12:40.060
All right, who's next?
Nellie.

12:40.128 --> 12:43.831
Oh, I would rather watch you
and your talented friends.

12:43.898 --> 12:45.799
Nonsense.
Get up here.

12:45.867 --> 12:48.035
- Go ahead.
- Come on.

12:50.772 --> 12:53.807
Uh, you gonna wear your heels?

12:53.875 --> 12:56.076
I'm very self-conscious
about my feet.

12:56.144 --> 12:57.177
Okay. Sure.

12:57.245 --> 13:00.481
There you go.
Atta girl.

13:00.548 --> 13:02.216
Hey, all right.

13:02.283 --> 13:05.185
Whoa! You suck.
[Chuckles]

13:05.253 --> 13:07.688
All right, who's next?
Darryl.

13:07.756 --> 13:08.989
This seems like
the kind of thing

13:09.057 --> 13:10.424
white people
with dreadlocks do.

13:10.492 --> 13:12.493
Dwight Jr., this looks
like your speed.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.661
Uh, I guess I can
give it a shot.

13:14.729 --> 13:16.163
Yeah, come on.
Get up here.

13:16.231 --> 13:19.266
- Just hop on up.
- Okay.

13:19.334 --> 13:23.103
Focus on the horizon.

13:23.171 --> 13:25.906
Whoa!
Look at this guy.

13:25.974 --> 13:29.610
[Cheers and applause]

13:29.677 --> 13:30.711
I've always been good
at anything

13:30.778 --> 13:32.179
that required balance.

13:32.247 --> 13:34.214
My doctor says I have
gigantic inner ears.

13:34.282 --> 13:37.451
[Cheers and applause]
Go, Dwight Jr.

13:37.519 --> 13:39.553
- Yes!
- Boo! Unimpressed.

13:39.621 --> 13:42.623
It's a tightrope for babies.
Boo.

13:42.690 --> 13:44.091
All right, let's see you do it.

13:44.159 --> 13:45.559
All right, let me show you
how a real man

13:45.627 --> 13:47.161
walks across a flaccid cord.

13:58.339 --> 13:59.473
Oh, ho ho ho!

13:59.541 --> 14:02.109
Who ordered the hot apple fail?

14:02.177 --> 14:04.878
Okay, I am just
getting started, okay?

14:04.946 --> 14:09.950
You got this.
This is all you.

14:10.018 --> 14:12.152
Oh!
[Laughter]

14:12.220 --> 14:15.355
- Oh...
- Got ourselves a yard sale.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.294
- Oh.
- Whoa.

14:20.361 --> 14:21.462
Balls <i>and</i> face.

14:21.529 --> 14:23.864
- It's not a race, Dwight.
- Aah!

14:26.701 --> 14:29.336
- Oh!
- Well, it's official...

14:29.404 --> 14:32.840
Old Dwight is lame,
and new Dwight is cool.

14:32.907 --> 14:34.274
That's not true.

14:34.342 --> 14:36.944
[All gasp]
Just give me another chance.

14:37.011 --> 14:38.612
- But your mouth is...
- This is a bloodbath.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.147
All right, I'm calling this.

14:40.215 --> 14:41.915
- What?
- It's enough of this.

14:41.983 --> 14:43.484
Everyone, let's go back
to work.

14:43.551 --> 14:45.252
This is a stupid activity.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.321
I would be embarrassed
to be good at it.

14:50.525 --> 14:53.660
Get...

14:53.728 --> 14:55.429
Idiots!

15:03.507 --> 15:06.142
Slacklining.
Big deal.

15:06.210 --> 15:07.977
Untie that rope,
give it to a couple

15:08.045 --> 15:09.212
of pigtailed school girls,

15:09.280 --> 15:10.647
let them start jumping with it

15:10.714 --> 15:13.383
while chanting a rhyme
and giggling about boys.

15:13.451 --> 15:15.218
Doesn't seem so macho now,
does it?

15:15.286 --> 15:18.088
It's a jump rope!

15:18.155 --> 15:20.390
[Cell phone chimes]

15:27.631 --> 15:29.365
[Twang]

15:29.433 --> 15:33.069
Dwight!

15:33.137 --> 15:35.071
Pam?
Hey, I'm up here.

15:35.139 --> 15:37.941
Up the ladder.
Come on.

15:47.051 --> 15:49.986
What are you doing?

15:50.054 --> 15:53.156
Come here.
I'll show you.

15:54.758 --> 15:57.093
Why do you want this cat?

15:57.161 --> 15:58.194
Um, I don't want it, really.

15:58.262 --> 16:00.063
How would you support the cat?

16:00.131 --> 16:02.165
What are your ambitions?

16:02.233 --> 16:03.266
I want to start
my own business.

16:03.334 --> 16:04.834
I want to be a millionaire.

16:04.902 --> 16:08.004
Lots of things... Travel.
Make the world a better place.

16:08.072 --> 16:10.140
Earn an MBA at night.

16:10.207 --> 16:12.642
Have you taken any
concrete steps?

16:12.710 --> 16:15.879
Well, I'm still just...
fitting in here.

16:15.946 --> 16:17.180
You know, getting used
to the new job.

16:17.248 --> 16:21.217
- Mm-hmm.
- But definitely on the agenda.

16:21.285 --> 16:24.487
But that is a good idea, Angela.
I should make a list.

16:24.555 --> 16:27.390
Oh, come on, Pete.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.459
God, that's just sad.

16:29.527 --> 16:32.729
If he doesn't watch himself,
he's gonna be here for years

16:32.796 --> 16:34.764
doing nothing.

16:40.037 --> 16:43.106
Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.

16:46.644 --> 16:50.313
Do you see how the trapeze
completely surrounds the wire?

16:50.381 --> 16:52.482
That means it is
literally impossible

16:52.550 --> 16:54.150
for anyone to fall off.

16:54.218 --> 16:55.518
So you will merely sit below

16:55.586 --> 16:56.819
and be my counterweight

16:56.887 --> 16:58.688
as I pedal across
the parking lot

16:58.756 --> 16:59.856
to that telephone pole,

16:59.924 --> 17:01.357
- I will?
- You will.

17:01.425 --> 17:02.992
Yeah, we weigh about
the same, wouldn't you say?

17:03.060 --> 17:06.863
- Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.
- So you'll do it?

17:06.931 --> 17:08.897
- No.
- Come on!

17:08.965 --> 17:11.166
This will be the only thrill
of your boring life.

17:11.234 --> 17:13.403
Dwight, you may find this
hard to believe,

17:13.470 --> 17:15.070
but I love my boring life...

17:15.138 --> 17:16.573
- Come on.
- Exactly the way it is.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.640
- No, Pam.
- Yes.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.041
And there's nothing you can say

17:19.108 --> 17:21.944
that would get me to run
the slightest risk of losing it.

17:22.012 --> 17:24.314
- Please? Please, Pam?
- Find someone else.

17:24.381 --> 17:25.781
I don't know, ask Phyllis.

17:25.848 --> 17:27.517
I can't use Phyllis.
Are you kidding me?

17:27.585 --> 17:29.052
The moment she steps
off this bar

17:29.119 --> 17:30.453
I'll be launched into space.

17:30.521 --> 17:33.523
God, you're so insensitive!

17:38.128 --> 17:39.128
Why are you getting rid of it?

17:39.196 --> 17:40.363
Allergies.

17:40.431 --> 17:42.532
- Your husband?
- No, the baby.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.701
Please, it's my husband's
favorite cat.

17:44.768 --> 17:46.302
He's broken up about it.

17:46.370 --> 17:48.104
It's the only time
I've seen him cry

17:48.172 --> 17:49.272
other than our wedding night.

17:49.340 --> 17:52.575
You know what?
I will take Comstock.

17:52.643 --> 17:56.813
Really?
Oh, Oscar, thank you!

17:56.880 --> 17:58.581
I'll come by after work
and pick him up.

17:58.649 --> 18:01.851
Yay!
Oh, poor Robert.

18:01.919 --> 18:03.453
He won't get to say good-bye.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.255
He has this business dinner
tonight.

18:05.322 --> 18:07.257
Oh, <i>c'est la vie.</i>

18:07.324 --> 18:11.928
Please don't teach
the cat French.

18:11.996 --> 18:14.097
[Chuckles] Yeah, good news.

18:14.164 --> 18:15.431
Tonight, when you come over
for dinner,

18:15.499 --> 18:18.468
you can play
with your old buddy Comstock.

18:27.378 --> 18:28.978
You ready?

18:29.046 --> 18:30.547
Yeah.

18:30.614 --> 18:31.848
You know what?
I'll meet you down there.

18:31.915 --> 18:32.949
I've just gotta make
a quick call.

18:33.017 --> 18:35.652
Okay.

18:42.493 --> 18:44.761
Okay.

18:44.828 --> 18:48.831
All right...

18:48.899 --> 18:51.868
Oh, God.

18:51.935 --> 18:54.671
[Exhales]

19:24.601 --> 19:29.005
Attention, employees
of Dunder Mifflin.

19:29.073 --> 19:32.308
Everyone thinks the new guys
are so cool

19:32.376 --> 19:34.344
'cause they can slackline.

19:34.411 --> 19:35.878
Ooh!

19:35.946 --> 19:38.981
Hey, Clark, this is what
a real salesman looks like.

19:40.984 --> 19:42.919
They say that you only
live once,

19:42.986 --> 19:44.387
and I'm about to prove it.

19:44.455 --> 19:46.989
- Dwight Schrute!
- Dwight!

19:47.057 --> 19:48.991
Hey, man, it's Halpert.

19:49.059 --> 19:51.094
Did you go
to the other guy yet?

19:51.161 --> 19:55.098
Great. Don't.
I'm in.

19:55.165 --> 19:59.435
[Chuckles]
Yeah, yep, I'm all in.

19:59.503 --> 20:02.772
Okay, talk to you soon.
Bye.

20:07.244 --> 20:09.846
Yeah!

20:12.616 --> 20:14.717
Whoo-hoo!

20:15.819 --> 20:18.454
Whoo-hoo!

20:18.522 --> 20:23.025
[All gasp, cry out]

20:23.093 --> 20:26.028
- Call somebody.
- Hang on!

20:26.096 --> 20:29.866
Hang on!
Hold on, Dwight!

20:29.933 --> 20:31.567
[Screams]

20:31.635 --> 20:33.870
In the parking lot today,
there was a circus.

20:33.937 --> 20:37.607
The copier did tricks
on the high wire.

20:37.674 --> 20:39.809
A lady tried to give away
a baby that looked like a cat.

20:39.877 --> 20:43.379
There was a Dwight impersonator
and a Jim impersonator.

20:43.447 --> 20:45.314
A strongman crushed a turtle.

20:45.382 --> 20:49.385
I laughed and I cried.

20:49.453 --> 20:52.588
Not bad for a day in the life
of a dog food company.

20:57.664 --> 20:59.832
Crap, sorry, Nellie.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.434
Once again, I understand
that old habits die hard,

21:02.502 --> 21:06.438
but if everyone would kindly
walk their refuse

21:06.506 --> 21:09.341
to the trash bins,
instead of tossing them,

21:09.409 --> 21:10.843
then we would...

21:10.911 --> 21:12.845
Oh...
Swish.

21:12.913 --> 21:14.446
Oh, it's nothing to do with me.

21:14.514 --> 21:19.051
I just happen to be sitting
near to where the bins are.

21:19.119 --> 21:21.320
There are two things
that I am passionate about...

21:21.388 --> 21:26.792
Recycling and revenge.
[Snickers]
