WEBVTT

00:08.340 --> 00:12.299
MATAN:
Your Honor, the defendants,
Howard Lampe and Darla Riggs,

00:12.340 --> 00:14.808
conspired to transport
and deliver cocaine

00:14.840 --> 00:16.808
on a flight from Rio
this past July.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.670
They should be
tried together because

00:18.710 --> 00:20.644
they committed
this crime together.
WILL: No, they are

00:20.680 --> 00:22.716
accused of committing
this crime together.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.786
It would prejudice my client
to be tried alongside Mr. Lampe.

00:24.820 --> 00:25.912
ALICIA:
And my client
alongside Ms. Riggs.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.350
We ask again, Your Honor,
that you sever these cases...

00:28.390 --> 00:29.459
ALICIA:
It is only in the interest
of judicial economy...

00:29.490 --> 00:31.185
Your Honor, all of the
prosecution witnesses are common

00:31.230 --> 00:33.198
to both Mr. Lampe and Ms. Riggs.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.458
It is the height of insanity

00:34.500 --> 00:36.297
to force these witnesses
to testify

00:36.330 --> 00:37.160
in two separate trials.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.339
Yes, we understand
the inconvenience...

00:39.370 --> 00:40.462
MATAN:
This isn't about inconvenience.
This is about a costly outlay...

00:40.500 --> 00:41.762
ALICIA:
That is a small price to pay

00:41.800 --> 00:43.802
for what this
trial should be.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.762
It's an injustice, Your Honor.
That seems petty...
Thank you... all.

00:45.810 --> 00:48.199
My concern, counselors,

00:48.240 --> 00:51.141
is that severance of
the two trials was not requested

00:51.180 --> 00:52.442
in a timely fashion.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.516
ALICIA:
Yes, Your Honor,
the circumstances

00:54.550 --> 00:56.245
of the defense
have changed.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.245
And what circumstances
are those?

00:57.290 --> 00:59.315
Our firm has since...
Two months ago, Your...

00:59.360 --> 01:01.612
Our_firm has
smce...
Two months ago...

01:03.260 --> 01:05.080
Go.
Well, thank you.

01:05.130 --> 01:07.394
When we originally
represented the two defendants,

01:07.430 --> 01:10.228
we were one firm acting
in concert,

01:10.270 --> 01:11.396
but Mrs. Florrick
poached our clients...

01:11.430 --> 01:14.137
Oh, we didn't
poach anyone.
What would
you call it?

01:14.170 --> 01:15.467
So, you want to sever
your two cases

01:15.500 --> 01:16.637
because you are now
two law firms?

01:16.670 --> 01:19.207
Yes, Your Honor. It's in the
best interest of our clients.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.776
Mr. Lampe, Ms. Riggs,
you agree with this?

01:20.810 --> 01:22.778
Uh, yeah, yeah, we
think it's for the best.

01:22.810 --> 01:24.141
Yes, Your Honor.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.306
Since the defendants

01:25.350 --> 01:27.443
are entitled to separate trials,

01:27.480 --> 01:29.380
I have no choice

01:29.420 --> 01:30.682
but to grant
a severance.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.278
Thank you,
Your Honor.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.448
But I am severing cases,
not courtrooms.

01:35.490 --> 01:38.357
It will be a double jury trial.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.358
A double...? Uh, Judge,
I don't think that that...

01:40.400 --> 01:42.322
Your Honor, two juries will
complicate our prosecution.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.826
Yes. That is
understandable.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.566
But I am a_ staunch advocate
of judICIal efﬁcrency.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.160
And you two counselors

01:49.210 --> 01:52.577
will just have to
act in concert again.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.805
We will commence jury selection
this afternoon. Thank you.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.478
Are you all right?

01:56.510 --> 01:57.545
Yeah. You?

01:57.580 --> 01:58.899
I'm good.

01:58.950 --> 01:59.917
I love you.

01:59.950 --> 02:01.542
I love you.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.684
CARY:
I heard.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.517
So this should
be interesting.

02:05.550 --> 02:09.179
Which? Working alongside Will,
or a double jury?

02:09.230 --> 02:11.425
Oh, yeah, a
double jury.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.826
Uh... I'll
first chair.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.691
What? Why?

02:15.730 --> 02:18.392
Calm things down, keep it
from getting too emotional.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.533
I won't get emotional.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.538
We're on the same side on this.

02:21.570 --> 02:22.832
Not you. Will.

02:22.870 --> 02:24.531
Keep him from getting emotional.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.469
Okay. You first chair.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.441
ELI:
It was sent as an anonymous tip

02:33.480 --> 02:34.674
to Anne Stevens,
the Tribune reporter.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.915
I've never seen this before
in my life.
The tip said,

02:36.950 --> 02:39.350
"Here is evidence of Peter
FlorrIck stealing an election.

02:39.390 --> 02:40.584
Happy hunting."

02:40.620 --> 02:41.552
Are they running it?

02:41.590 --> 02:42.625
No. I got a two-week delay.

02:42.660 --> 02:43.729
I had to trade for it.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.852
Give 'em our pension rollout.

02:44.890 --> 02:48.621
Who is that?
Is that someone you know?

02:48.660 --> 02:50.525
No.
ELI:
Yes. It's Jim Moody,

02:50.570 --> 02:51.628
my fixer during the campaign.

02:51.670 --> 02:52.796
PETER: What?!

02:52.840 --> 02:53.966
ELI:
I didn't ask him
to do anything.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.331
Wait. No one say anything.

02:55.370 --> 02:56.405
Mr. Governor,
it is in

02:56.440 --> 02:59.273
your best interest
to not talk to Eli at this time.

02:59.310 --> 03:00.607
Everything being said now,

03:00.640 --> 03:02.505
everything that was just
discussed, we'll have

03:02.550 --> 03:04.472
to repeat at some point
to federal investigators.

03:04.510 --> 03:06.842
Well, that was the shortest
honeymoon period in history.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.575
One month as a governor.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.485
MARILYN:
We don't even know
what this is, Mr. Governor.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.351
What we're seeing is a ballot
box. It could be anything.

03:12.390 --> 03:13.618
ELI:
No. Our lavwers argued

03:13.660 --> 03:14.957
in court that it was
a stuffed ballot box.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.321
Then we found out that

03:16.360 --> 03:17.554
the 30,000 votes
were for Peter.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.251
Who was the lavwer
who argued in court?

03:21.730 --> 03:24.528
I'll have to question them.

03:24.570 --> 03:26.561
Alicia.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.488
Your wife?

03:28.540 --> 03:29.529
30,000 votes.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.731
You don't steal an election
with 30,000 votes.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.237
We won by eight points!

03:33.280 --> 03:34.872
Okay. We can't discuss this
anymore.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.775
Eli, I'll need to
question you first.

03:36.810 --> 03:38.539
I'll be right there.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.546
You can't be talking.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.683
It's not about this.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.711
We all know the maxim,
but it's true.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.751
"It's not the crime,
it's the cover-up."

03:48.790 --> 03:50.849
Marilyn, there is no cover-up.

03:50.890 --> 03:53.597
But for me to run this state,
I need

03:53.630 --> 03:56.463
to be able to talk
to my chief of staff alone.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.559
Very well.

04:00.970 --> 04:02.528
(door opens, closes)

04:02.570 --> 04:03.798
Who's the tipster? Moody?

04:03.840 --> 04:06.536
No, no. He's a
soldier. He gets it.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.376
(Eli sighs)

04:07.410 --> 04:09.378
Someone at
Lockhart/Gardner?
Why?

04:09.410 --> 04:11.378
Will Gardner came
to my hotel swte

04:11.410 --> 04:13.412
on election day
to show me a video.

04:13.450 --> 04:15.509
Damn it.
I refused
to look at it.

04:15.550 --> 04:17.643
There is a lot of hate for
us over there these days.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.658
Diane?
No. It doesn't
seem like her.

04:19.690 --> 04:21.385
Will could be out of his mind.

04:22.860 --> 04:24.828
Keep tabs on her.

04:24.860 --> 04:26.828
Already on it.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.851
(overlapping crowd chatter)

04:34.970 --> 04:36.562

Yup.

Thank you, ma'am.
You may be seated.

Actually, ma'am,

04:57.930 --> 04:59.454
not that jury.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.626
The folding-chair jury.

Your Honor._Is this for

So she's all right
for the Howard Lampe jury,

05:08.670 --> 05:10.661
but not ours? _
We don't have to explain
our preemptory challenge.

When there is a disagreement
in a relationship

between a man and a woman,
do you think

05:21.450 --> 05:23.941
it's better for the man
to decide, or the woman?

05:23.990 --> 05:26.584
Well, it's probably better
if the guy does, just 'cause

05:26.620 --> 05:27.484
someone has to.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.488
And if the guy did decide,
would you...

05:29.530 --> 05:30.883
Excuse me.
...blame the woman
for his deCI5|on?

05:30.930 --> 05:32.488
Your Honor, we object
to this question.

Your Honor, it's not
their place to object.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.598
I don't have anything.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.029
I thought this was
a collaborative defense.

We've changed our minds.

Okay.

We have a chance

06:16.640 --> 06:17.766
The Paisley Group.

How do you know?

I have a friend

Uh, yes, sir.

07:22.910 --> 07:23.729
Do we have to sit

07:25.640 --> 07:26.777
Yes,

Okay. Perhaps we can alternate.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.786
Why do we have to alternate?

07:52.070 --> 07:54.698
once they entered
the Customs area.

07:56.870 --> 07:59.805
When a couple getting off a
plane from Brazil doesn't look

07:59.840 --> 08:02.775
organic, alarm
bells go off.

08:02.810 --> 08:05.870
And the defendants didn't look
like an organic couple?

08:05.910 --> 08:07.878
Could you explain?

08:07.920 --> 08:11.549
Well, uh, Mr. Lampe
looked like a professor.

08:11.590 --> 08:15.811
And, uh, Ms. Riggs, she
was, um, very pretty.

08:15.860 --> 08:18.556
GENEVA:
Anything else suggest they
might be transporting drugs?

08:18.590 --> 08:20.899
Yes. Mr. Lampe was
sweating profusely,

08:20.930 --> 08:23.125
and Ms. Riggs was
staring down at her feet.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.798
A search revealed a stash
of two pounds of cocaine.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.036
GENEVA:
Thank you, Officer.

08:27.070 --> 08:28.628
I tender the witness.

08:28.670 --> 08:32.629
Officer Sorrento, were you aware
that Ms. Riggs and

08:32.680 --> 08:34.807
Mr. Lampe met
and fell in love

08:34.840 --> 08:37.047
at Rio's Cinque Terre Resort

08:37.080 --> 08:38.945
the previous week?
No.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.948
So, this nervous behavior
that you observed

08:40.980 --> 08:43.585
could be attributable
to the fact

08:43.620 --> 08:45.986
that Mr. Lampe had invited
his new girlfriend home

08:46.020 --> 08:46.987
for the weekend?

08:47.020 --> 08:52.128
Or to the $100,000
in drugs in his carry-on.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.594
(scattered laughter)

08:54.630 --> 08:57.667
If the drugs were found
in Mr. Lampe's carry-on,

08:57.700 --> 08:59.634
why did you arrest
Ms. Riggs?

08:59.670 --> 09:01.069
Well, a search

09:01.100 --> 09:03.261
of Ms. Riggs revealed $30,000
on her person.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.402
So you have

09:04.440 --> 09:08.137
a circumstantial case_
that the defendants conspired?

09:08.180 --> 09:10.978
Yes. Based on my
investigation.

09:11.010 --> 09:14.309
Which yielded no direct evidence
that Ms. Riggs participated

09:14.350 --> 09:15.749
in Mr. Lampe's scheme...

09:15.780 --> 09:17.088
Objection. Assumes facts
not in evidence.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.849
JUDGE:
Sustained.
I will rephrase.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.949
You have no direct evidence

09:20.990 --> 09:23.823
that Ms. Riggs had access
to Mr. Lampe's bag?

09:23.860 --> 09:25.054
That's correct.

09:25.090 --> 09:27.957
Okay. They're coming after us.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.094
Officer, you said that
my client was carrying the bag.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.189
Meaning you concluded
it was his bag, right?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.639
Yes.

09:34.670 --> 09:37.662
Footage from the
Galeao Airport in Rio

09:37.710 --> 09:40.599
confirmed the bag was in the
sole possession of Mr. Lampe...

09:40.640 --> 09:44.041
Are you aware that Ms. Riggs had
reached her two carry-on limit

09:44.080 --> 09:46.002
and had given Mr. Lampe her bag

09:46.050 --> 09:48.245
to transport?
The bag had no name tag.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.840
But you assumed
it was Mr. Lampe's, right?

09:50.890 --> 09:53.711
But it's possible that
Mr. Lampe was an unwitting mark

09:53.760 --> 09:54.784
in a smuggling
scheme engineered...

09:54.820 --> 09:55.889
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.784
Sustained.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.923
Your Honor,
we are codefendants here.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.222
Ms. Lockhart can't object.

10:00.260 --> 10:02.148
He sustained your objection
to ou questioning.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.361
Yeah, which was a mistake.
WILL:
Excuse me, Your Honor.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.288
I'm not gonna allow Mr. Agos
to criticize this...

10:06.330 --> 10:08.366
(overlapping chatter)

10:08.400 --> 10:10.800
MARILYN:
Mr. Gold, is the man

10:10.840 --> 10:12.899
in this surveillance photo
Mr. Jim Moody?

10:12.940 --> 10:14.931
As far as I can tell, yes.
Did you order

10:14.980 --> 10:17.676
Mr. Moody to perform
these actions?
No, I did not.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.143
Did you ever hint
to Mr. Moody

10:19.180 --> 10:20.738
that he should do
something illegal

10:20.780 --> 10:23.089
regarding the
ballot boxes?

10:26.090 --> 10:27.887
Yes?
That's too broad.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.683
What part?
Did I ever hint?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.027
You're saying
you did hint?

10:31.060 --> 10:32.425
No, I'm saying the answer

10:32.460 --> 10:34.894
to a question like that
could lead to misunderstandings.

10:34.930 --> 10:37.023
Eli, we have to be honest
with each other.
Marilyn,

10:37.070 --> 10:38.423
I make 800 decisions a day.

10:38.470 --> 10:40.199
During a campaign,
it's twice that many.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.037
I can not micro-manage

10:42.070 --> 10:43.708
every person
I give a direction to.

10:43.740 --> 10:44.832
There's not enough time.

10:44.870 --> 10:45.939
I give them a direction,

10:45.970 --> 10:47.676
then let_ them exercise
their creatIVIty

10:47.710 --> 10:50.270
in accomplishing
that... direction.

10:50.310 --> 10:51.902
And is "creativity"

10:51.950 --> 10:52.974
a euphemism for "illegality"?

10:53.020 --> 10:54.214
No.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.138
What direction
did you give Jim Moody

10:56.180 --> 10:58.011
that he might have exercised
his creativity

10:58.050 --> 10:59.187
to do that?

10:59.220 --> 11:00.312
(sighs)

11:00.360 --> 11:03.158
I said we were short of votes
in the 12th precinct,

11:03.190 --> 11:05.078
and we needed
to get out the vote.

11:05.130 --> 11:07.052
There's nothing wrong with
saying "get out the vote."

11:09.800 --> 11:11.324
There's a chance...

11:11.370 --> 11:14.168
I said we needed to do
whatever we could.

11:17.170 --> 11:17.932
(sighs)

11:17.970 --> 11:19.835
But _I would insist
that is my manner.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.734
_ I am absolutist
in my encouragement...

11:21.780 --> 11:23.145
toward my underlings.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.078
Here's the_
problem, Eli:

11:24.110 --> 11:25.998
If Mr. Moody believes
you encouraged him

11:26.050 --> 11:27.244
to stuff that ballot box,

11:27.280 --> 11:29.942
your words are
problematic.
I did not order him.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.788
Will Mr. Moody
back you up on that?

11:33.820 --> 11:35.811
* I got high hopes *

11:38.060 --> 11:39.687
* I got high hopes *

11:43.000 --> 11:44.991
* I got high hopes *

11:46.530 --> 11:49.169
* I got high hopes. *

11:52.940 --> 11:55.238
WOMAN: Sorry, I have to pack
for a red-eye tonight.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.975
After court.
Oh, that's all right,
Ms. Barrett,

11:57.010 --> 11:58.045
this'll only take a minute.
You know,

11:58.080 --> 12:00.219
I already told the prosecution
everything I know.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.138
They're supposed to
share it with you, right?

12:02.180 --> 12:03.386
Um... yeah.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.183
But I'm wondering
about some things

12:05.220 --> 12:07.882
that they may not
have asked you about.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.353
Do you want a gummy bear?
I do.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.755
Thanks.

12:10.790 --> 12:11.688
So did Ms. Riggs exhibit

12:11.730 --> 12:14.358
any other sketchy behavior
on the flight?

12:14.400 --> 12:17.119
Like, did she drink too much
or maybe steal magazines?

12:17.170 --> 12:19.126
No. Why?
Well,

12:19.170 --> 12:21.229
you've seen my client, right?

12:21.270 --> 12:24.034
Why would a woman like her
be interested in a guy like him,

12:24.070 --> 12:25.139
a dorlq
calculus professor?

12:25.170 --> 12:26.262
Unless she was
usmg him.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.107
Well there was that
thing in the bathroom.

12:28.140 --> 12:31.143
Yeah, that thing
in the bathroom.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.239
Sorry, wait, what was
that thing in the bathroom?

12:33.280 --> 12:35.475
The... Mile High Club thing.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.738
(knocking)

12:39.450 --> 12:41.259
Robyn. Hello.
Hello.

12:41.290 --> 12:42.211
May I help you?

12:42.260 --> 12:44.785
Yeah, I just need to
ask you some questions.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.183
MAN:
We just don't understand

12:46.230 --> 12:48.357
why we get the
small jury room

12:48.400 --> 12:50.288
and the other jury
gets the big one.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.262
It's not the big one.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.562
Ours is just as small.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.261
JUDGE: I'll remind you,
sir, that you are

12:54.300 --> 12:55.961
in the jury box.
You asked us

12:56.000 --> 12:57.331
to share that,
remember?

13:00.180 --> 13:02.876
We will rotate
the jury rooms as well

13:02.910 --> 13:04.502
as the seats.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.917
It was a full flight, and we had
no more overhead space.

13:07.950 --> 13:10.145
So I told Mr. Lampe his carry-on

13:10.190 --> 13:12.442
would have to be stowed
a few rows away.

13:12.490 --> 13:15.118
And how did he respond to that?
He was agitated,

13:15.160 --> 13:16.354
argued with me about it.
MATAN: In fact...

13:16.390 --> 13:19.450
there came a point when the bag
became the subject of dispute

13:19.490 --> 13:21.458
between Mr. Lampe
and another passenger,

13:21.500 --> 13:23.229
didn't it?
Yes, the
passenger in 26B

13:23.270 --> 13:25.261
tried to _move it to
access his own bag,

13:25.300 --> 13:26.597
and Mr. Lampe
shouted at him.

13:26.630 --> 13:29.838
And exactly what
did Mr. Lampe shout?

13:29.870 --> 13:31.303
Objection, hearsay.

13:31.340 --> 13:32.409
Your Honor, we object
to that objection.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.908
The jury has a right to hear
this exculpatory evidence.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.840
Which jury?

13:36.880 --> 13:39.974
Our jury. Ms. Riggs' jury.
Not in our jury's
presence, Your Honor.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.373
It is hearsay.
But not when used defensively.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.217
Harris,
please escort

13:43.250 --> 13:45.184
that jury,
the jury listening to

13:45.220 --> 13:47.017
Mr. Lampe's defense,
out to the jury room.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.459
But leave the
other jury behind.

13:48.490 --> 13:51.379
HARRIS:
Let's go. This way.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.523
MATAN: What did you hear
Mr. Lampe shout

13:53.560 --> 13:55.858
at the passenger
who tried to move his carry-on?

13:55.900 --> 13:59.028
He said, "Let go of my bag."

13:59.070 --> 14:01.391
And did Ms. Riggs intervene
in this argument?

14:01.440 --> 14:03.260
Objection,
Your Honor,

14:03.310 --> 14:07.007
our jury should be
allowed to hear this.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.268
You said it was hearsay.
No, the statement

14:08.310 --> 14:09.948
was hearsay,
not the ensuing encounter.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.301
Your Honor, we object to
the other defense editing

14:12.350 --> 14:15.148
the testimony
as they so wish.
What does it matter to you?

14:15.180 --> 14:17.239
_ You act like this
is a zero-sum game.
JUDGE: Thank you.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.315
The jury will be
allowed back in.

14:19.350 --> 14:20.351
Harris?

14:20.390 --> 14:22.415
Way ahead of you,
Your Honor.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.087
"We're taking the
gloves off." That's
what you told me.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.279
But I never
authorized you to...

14:27.560 --> 14:29.425
I didn't know
you were gonna do this.

14:29.460 --> 14:30.358
Eli, I could
fill a book

14:30.400 --> 14:33.198
with what you know about
what you don't know.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.094
So where are you taking this?

14:38.510 --> 14:40.398
I'm taking this...

14:40.440 --> 14:42.101
where you want
me to take this.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.445
If you're taping this, Jim,

14:48.480 --> 14:50.243
I'm not offering
third-party consent,

14:50.290 --> 14:52.417
so any recording will be
considered inadmissible.

14:52.450 --> 14:53.553
Wow.

14:53.590 --> 14:54.955
You think that of me?

14:54.990 --> 14:56.582
I think this conversation
is oddly stilted.

14:56.620 --> 14:59.418
Okay, let me make
it less stilted.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.655
I could get three years
for election fraud.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.498
Why do I do that?

15:04.530 --> 15:06.259
Because you're
a good soldier.

15:10.670 --> 15:12.535
I could get less
if I testified.

15:12.570 --> 15:14.208
And you'd have
no friends, then.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.969
Even

15:16.010 --> 15:17.944
Right now you have
the friendship of the governor.

15:17.980 --> 15:20.312
Lot of good
that does me.

15:20.350 --> 15:22.341
Better than no one.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.709
Okay.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.081
So it stops at you, right?

15:31.130 --> 15:32.449
And I wasn't here.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.965
CARY: Ms. Barrett,
you commented about noticing

15:41.000 --> 15:43.230
Ms. Riggs and Mr. Lampe.

15:43.270 --> 15:45.500
Did you see Ms. Riggs
in the vicinity

15:45.540 --> 15:47.132
of the business class restrooms?

15:47.180 --> 15:49.000
BARRETT: Yes.
Is this the woman you saw

15:49.040 --> 15:50.371
enter the lavatory
with Ms. Riggs?

15:50.410 --> 15:51.240
Objection,
Your Honor.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.178
Relevance?
CARY: The relevance is that

15:52.210 --> 15:54.974
Ms. Riggs was faking
her love for our client

15:55.020 --> 15:56.715
in order to get him
to deliver drugs.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.183
That is our contention,
Your Honor.

15:58.220 --> 15:59.244
JUDGE:
Overruled, I will allow.

15:59.290 --> 16:02.282
Ms. Barrett, how long were
Ms. Riggs and this woman

16:02.320 --> 16:03.480
in the lavatory together?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.725
About 15 minutes.
And when they emerged
from the bathroom,

16:05.760 --> 16:09.526
did you notice anything
unusual about Ms. Riggs?

16:09.560 --> 16:10.629
(quietly):
It's okay.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.160
She was adjusting her skirt.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.168
CARY:
Thank you.
It's not true, Howie.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.497
Excuse me, ma'am,
no talking here.

16:15.540 --> 16:16.564
JUDGE:
Ms. Pine?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.033
Judge, may we approach?

16:18.070 --> 16:19.367
The prosecution
would like to recall

16:19.410 --> 16:20.729
Ms. Riggs' jury
so they can hear

16:20.780 --> 16:22.099
this testimony
on redirect.

16:22.140 --> 16:23.346
We object to that,
Your Honor.

16:23.380 --> 16:25.746
On what basis?
Its prejudicial impact

16:25.780 --> 16:26.769
outweighs its probative value.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.209
That's why my client's jury

16:28.250 --> 16:31.117
was sequestered
in the first place.
No, your jury was sequestered

16:31.150 --> 16:33.380
because Ms. Riggs counsel
elicited the testimony.

16:33.420 --> 16:35.115
It's a different matter
if the prosecution elicited it.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.219
He's right, Ms. Lockhart.

16:37.260 --> 16:38.682
Ms. Riggs' defense is that

16:38.730 --> 16:41.290
she was manipulated
by Mr. Lampe.

16:41.330 --> 16:43.025
The prosecution
wants to undercut that

16:43.070 --> 16:45.721
by presenting testimony alleging
an on-flight liaison

16:45.770 --> 16:47.397
with a stranger.
That's exactly right,
Your Honor.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.395
Harris.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.668
Got it.

16:49.700 --> 16:50.735
You guys,

16:50.770 --> 16:52.237
let's go.

16:52.270 --> 16:53.237
BARRETT:
Yes,

16:53.280 --> 16:55.475
they were alone
in the bathroom for 15 minutes.

16:55.510 --> 16:56.670
And based on your experience

16:56.710 --> 16:59.747
as a flight attendant, when
two people enter a lavatory,

16:59.780 --> 17:01.543
what is usually
the purpose of that visit?

17:01.580 --> 17:02.649
Objection,

17:02.680 --> 17:03.647
calls for
speculation.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.816
Overruled.

17:04.850 --> 17:06.147
BARRETT:
Sex.

17:06.190 --> 17:07.350
Of course.

17:07.390 --> 17:08.482
DIANE:
Ms. Barrett,

17:08.520 --> 17:09.885
do you believe
in pre-marital sex?

17:09.920 --> 17:12.354
No.
MATAN:
Objection, relevance.
How is the witness's belief

17:12.390 --> 17:14.824
remotely relevant here?
Is is connected

17:14.860 --> 17:16.589
to her perception
of what happened.
Overruled.

17:16.630 --> 17:21.169
Ms. Barrett, you disapprove
of my client's lifestyle,

17:21.200 --> 17:22.235
don't you?
No.

17:22.270 --> 17:24.204
No? Well, my client
is attractive,

17:24.240 --> 17:28.131
she's unmarried, she's
traveling with a single man.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.374
You're jealous.
_ _ MATAN: _
Objection, argumentative.

17:29.410 --> 17:31.173
That one I'll sustain.
Did my client

17:31.210 --> 17:34.338
ask you for a clip
to keep her skirt

17:34.380 --> 17:36.075
from slipping?
What?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.348
Did my client ask you

17:37.390 --> 17:39.517
for something to keep
her skirt from slipping

17:39.550 --> 17:40.448
due to a broken clasp?

17:40.490 --> 17:41.514
She did, but...

17:41.560 --> 17:42.754
that's not...

17:42.790 --> 17:44.553
are you saying that
that's why this woman

17:44.590 --> 17:46.319
was helping her
in the lavatory?

17:46.360 --> 17:47.850
DIANE: Yes.
Objection, Your Honor,
misstates the eviden...

17:47.900 --> 17:50.164
(whispers): Don't object.
MATAN:
One second, Your Honor.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.498
(whispering): We need to
get the other jury back
in here to hear this.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.669
MATAN: Why do we need
the other jury?
We want to convict them both.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.100
She_can't be seen as
screwmg around on him.
JUDGE: Are you counselors

17:57.140 --> 17:58.732
still objecting?

17:58.770 --> 18:01.830
Actually, no, Your Honor.
We withdraw our objections

18:01.880 --> 18:04.474
and ask that we be allowed
to redirect this witness

18:04.510 --> 18:05.374
in front of the other jury.

18:05.410 --> 18:08.413
Are you friggin'
kidding me?
Harris.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.116
Why is that, Counselor?

18:11.150 --> 18:12.686
We need to...

18:14.390 --> 18:16.187
I don't know, I...

18:16.220 --> 18:17.426
because?

18:17.460 --> 18:19.428
(scoffs quietly)

18:19.460 --> 18:21.189
It was just
about my skirt.
I know.

18:21.230 --> 18:24.495
I trust you.
Here they come.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.893
They're offering six years.
CARY:
For each of you,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.669
but it's a package deal.
You both plead

18:29.700 --> 18:31.509
to simple possession
or neither of you do.

18:31.540 --> 18:34.509
Oh, it's an elementary
game theory, you know?

18:34.540 --> 18:36.576
We're better off
if we act together,

18:36.610 --> 18:39.670
but not as well off
as we might be if we act alone.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.211
It's the prosecution's idea.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.842
They want to play you
against each other.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.916
They weren't offering
a plea before trial,
now they are.

18:44.950 --> 18:47.453
It means they know
we've made a dent in their case.
And wh-what are

18:47.490 --> 18:49.117
our chances
of beating this?

18:50.260 --> 18:51.579
Um... why don't
we talk over here?

18:51.630 --> 18:53.325
No, no, no. No.
We're, uh...

18:53.360 --> 18:54.850
we're in this
together.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.221
Okay.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.158
You cut a pretty
sympathetic figure, Howard.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.567
Because my jury thinks
Darla manipulated me?

19:03.610 --> 19:04.907
Yes.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.608
What about my jury?

19:07.640 --> 19:10.768
It's better if they think
you're Howard's pawn.

19:10.810 --> 19:13.779
So our best chance here

19:13.820 --> 19:15.617
is if no one believes
we're in love.

19:15.650 --> 19:17.686
Yes.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.278
DIANE:
It's only for the purpose
of the trial.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.311
It's just for how
you appear in court.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.486
It's not really why...

19:22.520 --> 19:24.556
(Diane continues indistinctly)

19:24.590 --> 19:26.524
That's one of my jurors.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.790
_ ALICIA: _
Talking to one of mine.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.242
*

19:51.550 --> 19:55.179
* He pulls a prayer book
out of his sleeping bag *

19:56.390 --> 19:57.721
Can I buy you a drink?

19:59.860 --> 20:01.225
I have a drink.

20:01.260 --> 20:02.591
I'll buy you another.

20:02.630 --> 20:03.824
I'll take two.

20:05.670 --> 20:06.864
You following me?

20:06.900 --> 20:08.891
No, I'm having a drink.

20:10.940 --> 20:13.477
Kalinda, I told you I'd
give you five minutes.

20:13.510 --> 20:16.001
Don't waste 'em.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.600
Okay.

20:19.650 --> 20:21.242
I miss you.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.682
(laughs)

20:27.860 --> 20:28.918
You pretend you're
jumping ship

20:28.960 --> 20:30.848
with Florrick-Agos
so you can

20:30.890 --> 20:32.448
pass our secrets to
Lockhart/Gardner.

20:32.490 --> 20:33.855
They're my employer, Cary.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.697
And I was your friend.
Yeah, which is why

20:35.730 --> 20:37.322
I kept your secret
for three months.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.598
Oh, what...
what secret?

20:38.630 --> 20:39.790
That you were leaving.

20:39.830 --> 20:42.958
You know, Will was ready
to fire me for that.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.934
I'm not your enemy, Cary,

20:44.970 --> 20:47.279
but I can't endanger
my job for you.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.004
Great, you've
said your piece...

20:51.050 --> 20:52.642
BARTENDER:
Oh, I'm 5... I'm,

20:52.680 --> 20:53.908
Oh, my God.

20:53.950 --> 20:54.917
I am
so sorry.

20:54.950 --> 20:56.577
Here, wait, let me do this.

20:56.620 --> 20:57.780
Uh...
Iget it.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.981
I got it, I got
it, I got it.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.625
(phone vibrates)

21:09.730 --> 21:12.824
* Wherever somebody's
strugglin' to be free *

21:15.870 --> 21:18.930
* Look in their eyes,
Ma, you'll see me *

21:20.910 --> 21:23.674
* Well, the highway
is alive tonight *

21:26.780 --> 21:30.272
* Where it's headed
everybody knows *

21:31.590 --> 21:34.809
it I'm sittin' down here
in the campfire light *

21:37.430 --> 21:41.696
* With the ghost
of Old Tom Joad *

21:41.730 --> 21:45.518
* Well, the highway
is alive tonight... *

21:45.570 --> 21:48.960
When we got
into our room this morning,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.037
someone left stinlq
Thai food in the garbage.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.379
The other jury was
the last one in there.

21:54.410 --> 21:55.377
JUDGE:
Any other matters

21:55.410 --> 21:56.502
counsel would like to address

21:56.540 --> 21:58.076
before we begin?
GENEVA: No, Your Honor.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.077
WILL:
No, Your Honor.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.874
JUDGE:
Mrs. Florrick?

22:01.920 --> 22:03.979
Nothing, Your Honor.

22:04.020 --> 22:06.079
Then let us proceed,
shall we?

22:07.820 --> 22:09.617
Abel Botera...

22:09.660 --> 22:11.059
I'm a doorman
at the Cinque Terre Resort

22:11.090 --> 22:11.886
in Rio de Janeiro.

22:11.930 --> 22:14.751
Mr. Botera,
this is security video

22:14.800 --> 22:16.859
from the resort lobby
from the afternoon

22:16.900 --> 22:18.424
of July 11th of this year.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.028
Can you identify this man?

22:20.070 --> 22:21.162
Yes, that's Alonso Cazorla.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.930
And are you aware that
Mr. Cazorla has been convicted

22:23.970 --> 22:26.632
by Brazilian courts
of trafficking in narcotics

22:26.670 --> 22:28.103
on three separate occasions?

22:28.140 --> 22:29.277
Yes, everyone in Rio knows this.

22:29.310 --> 22:32.746
Can you identify the two people
meeting with him here?

22:32.780 --> 22:34.543
Yes. The defendants.

22:34.580 --> 22:36.514
CARY:
You've described Mr. Cazorla

22:36.550 --> 22:37.642
as a drug dealer.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.112
But he also runs
a scuba diVing company.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.152
Doesn't he?
And a nightclub,
two gas stations.

22:41.190 --> 22:43.158
All fronts for...
So what we're watching here

22:43.190 --> 22:45.385
could simply be an exchange
of money for scuba gear.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.625
Isn't that right?
I guess.

22:47.660 --> 22:49.890
In fact, didn't Ms. Riggs
ask you to arrange

22:49.930 --> 22:51.397
a_ scuba lesson
With Mr. Cazorla

22:51.430 --> 22:53.159
a day before this
video was taken?

22:53.200 --> 22:55.964
Yes.
And that scuba lesson was
for Ms. Riggs alone.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.661
Wasn't it? Yes.
Yes.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.904
So to your knowledge,
only Ms. Riggs met

22:58.940 --> 23:00.134
with Mr. Cazorla
prior to the meeting

23:00.170 --> 23:01.398
that was captured on this video?

23:01.440 --> 23:03.601
Objection, Your Honor, sidebar.
Right?

23:03.650 --> 23:05.777
(Whispering):
By eliciting testimony
that my client alone

23:05.810 --> 23:07.107
met with a convicted
drug dealer,

23:07.150 --> 23:09.539
Mr. Agos is implying
that Ms. Riggs

23:09.580 --> 23:11.081
was solely responsible.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.485
We have an absolute right
to exculpate our client.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.010
_DIANE;
Not by implicating ours,
you don't.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.051
Judge, we request
limiting instructions.

23:16.090 --> 23:19.719
It's like herding cats
with you people.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.149
Step back.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.065
(snaps fingers)

23:24.100 --> 23:25.795
It'd be better if
we work together.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.832
Tell that to Will.

23:32.470 --> 23:34.108
What is it?

23:34.140 --> 23:37.109
Kalinda thinks the Paisley Group
might be ready to bolt.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.903
We've been ignoring them.

23:38.950 --> 23:41.043
Yeah, she has information
on a case they're worried about.

23:41.080 --> 23:45.016
Can you handle this?
Yes, go.

23:45.050 --> 23:48.087
I am instructing
Ms. Riggs' jury

23:48.120 --> 23:51.180
to disregard
Mr. Agos' entire cross.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.221
Mr. Lampe's jury, the ones
in the folding chairs...

23:53.260 --> 23:56.024
No, we're up here now.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.995
Okay, good.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.064
I'm happy.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.965
Has someone told you
I'm not happy?

24:05.010 --> 24:07.228
We just want to do
our due diligence, sir.

24:07.270 --> 24:09.204
The Paisley Group matters to us.
You matter to us.

24:09.240 --> 24:12.801
Well, at first,
I considered Florrick-Agos.

24:12.850 --> 24:15.068
But again, I'm happy.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.510
I don't know
how else to say it.

24:18.550 --> 24:21.189
I understand, sir,
but we've identified some areas

24:21.220 --> 24:23.188
where you may need help.
Haley Elliott?

24:25.160 --> 24:27.082
What about her?

24:27.130 --> 24:28.791
Not to sound indelicate.

24:30.030 --> 24:31.520
I know about
the solicitation charge, sir.

24:31.570 --> 24:34.869
You-you know...?

24:34.900 --> 24:37.835
I don't...

24:37.870 --> 24:39.861
What do you know?

24:39.910 --> 24:41.537
That any decent firm
can get you off,

24:41.580 --> 24:43.172
but the matter's
still public record.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.576
Now, Lockhart/Gardner can get
the arrest expunged.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.146
Whi_ch as a CEO of a
major corporation...

24:47.180 --> 24:49.569
Haley is not a prostitute.
She's my granddaughter.

24:51.150 --> 24:53.983
She's...?

24:54.020 --> 24:55.749
Is this some sort of joke?

24:55.790 --> 24:57.212
She's in a Wheelchair
with Hodgkin's.

24:59.190 --> 25:01.192
No, sir, I'm-I'm very sorry.

25:01.230 --> 25:03.994
I was terribly
misinformed.
Yes, you were.

25:04.030 --> 25:05.998
Is there anything else
you need from me?

25:06.030 --> 25:07.065
No, sir.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.533
We're... fine.

25:08.570 --> 25:10.959
I'll call this afternoon.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.637
What was that about?

25:12.670 --> 25:14.035
Cary.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.071
What about him?

25:18.210 --> 25:21.748
Yes, Mr. Paisley, absolutely,
we would love to meet.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.611
Right, exactly,
one of the reasons

25:23.650 --> 25:25.242
we left Lockhart/Gardner was
because it was getting too big,

25:25.290 --> 25:26.939
and losing sight of its clients.

25:26.990 --> 25:28.810
The Paisley Group.
You're kidding? How?

25:28.860 --> 25:30.009
I thought they
weren't coming.

25:30.060 --> 25:32.028
I paid a bartender
to spill a drink on me.

25:32.060 --> 25:34.893
You...? (stammers)
No, I'm here, I'm here.

25:34.930 --> 25:37.228
We're following
all the ethical rules, Marilyn.

25:37.260 --> 25:40.229
Yes, unfortunately, this isn't
about the ethical rules.

25:40.270 --> 25:42.659
I-I just need to ask you
a few questions, Alicia.

25:42.700 --> 25:43.906
After court.

25:43.940 --> 25:46.067
This isn't about you
as Peter's spouse.

25:46.110 --> 25:47.600
It's about you
as Peter's lavwer.

25:47.640 --> 25:48.868
Court is now in session.

25:48.910 --> 25:52.038
The Honorable
Loudon Spencer presiding.

25:56.780 --> 25:58.213
Mr. Botera?

25:58.250 --> 26:00.309
What languages
does Mr. Cazorla speak?

26:00.350 --> 26:01.317
Far as I know

26:01.360 --> 26:01.985
just Portuguese.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.282
So only a person
conversant

26:03.320 --> 26:05.026
in Portuguese could have

26:05.060 --> 26:06.288
a meaningful conversation
with him?

26:06.330 --> 26:07.797
I guess.
And to your knowledge,

26:07.830 --> 26:10.298
did either Mr. Lampe
or Ms. Riggs speak Portuguese?

26:10.330 --> 26:12.890
Only Mr. Lampe did.
Which is why he was
the only one

26:12.930 --> 26:14.739
who was speaking
to Mr. Cazorla in the video.

26:14.770 --> 26:16.988
Right?
Judge, sidebar?

26:17.040 --> 26:18.735
This is precisely
the type of questioning

26:18.770 --> 26:20.260
that Mr. Gardner objected to.

26:20.310 --> 26:22.039
Apples and oranges, Your Honor.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.071
He's implicating our client
in front of our jury.

26:24.110 --> 26:25.668
After you implicated ours
in front of hers.

26:25.710 --> 26:27.371
Look, if this is about the
Paisley Group, why don't you

26:27.410 --> 26:28.240
just come out and say it?
DIANE:_What are
you talking about?

26:28.280 --> 26:29.440
CARY: We request
limiting instructions.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.641
No.
ALICIA: Your Honor, Without
limiting instructions,

26:31.690 --> 26:33.851
our client's case is
fatally compromised.

26:33.890 --> 26:35.312
Sit down, Counselor.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.386
You understand that's
rever5ible error, right?

26:38.430 --> 26:39.283
Excuse me?

26:39.330 --> 26:41.298
I think Mrs. Florrick
is simply requesting

26:41.330 --> 26:42.957
an explanation for the record.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.790
Here's my explanation.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.933
I'm tired of the games

26:50.970 --> 26:53.302
and the backbiting.

26:53.340 --> 26:55.331
We're gonna finish this trial.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.371
You understand?
No more sequestration.

26:57.410 --> 26:59.241
No more limiting
instructions.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.316
If you want to appeal
at the end of it,

27:01.350 --> 27:03.648
knock yourself out.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.749
I would like to request
conference in chambers.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.251
You're on thin ice
here, Mrs. Florrick,

27:09.290 --> 27:10.382
I understand.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.354
But there's a matter
I've been remiss

27:12.390 --> 27:16.349
in bringing to the court's
immediate attention.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.288
Juror misconduct?

27:18.330 --> 27:20.264
Yes! Your Honor,
we saw two jurors

27:20.300 --> 27:21.335
from opposing juries...

27:21.370 --> 27:22.689
They're not opposing.

27:22.740 --> 27:23.832
...conferring with each other

27:23.870 --> 27:25.007
after court yesterday.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.031
And what's your explanation

27:27.070 --> 27:28.139
for sitting on this?

27:28.180 --> 27:29.932
Context, Your Honor.

27:29.980 --> 27:31.971
Initially I thought it was
an innocent exchange.

27:32.010 --> 27:33.443
And did you Witness

27:33.480 --> 27:35.846
this illicit communication,
too, Mr. Gardner?

27:35.880 --> 27:36.847
No, Judge.

27:36.880 --> 27:40.316
Your Honor, that's...

27:40.350 --> 27:42.454
Mr. Gardner was with me.

27:42.490 --> 27:44.378
If Mrs. Florrick is accusing
me of lying to the court,

27:44.430 --> 27:45.283
I assume she can corroborate

27:45.330 --> 27:47.321
that accusation.

27:53.170 --> 27:54.432
(quietly): Uh...

27:54.470 --> 27:57.098
um, no, Your Honor.

27:57.140 --> 28:00.359
Per... perhaps I was mistaken

28:00.410 --> 28:02.674
as to what Mr. Gardner observed.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.752
So you know nothing
about this video?

28:16.360 --> 28:18.328
Alicia, have you seen
this video before?

28:18.360 --> 28:19.850
No.

28:19.890 --> 28:21.118
Do you know anything
about the activity

28:21.160 --> 28:22.798
depicted in this video?
No.

28:22.830 --> 28:24.263
But these were the ballots

28:24.300 --> 28:25.722
you went to court
to dispute, correct?

28:25.770 --> 28:27.123
I have no idea.

28:27.170 --> 28:28.432
And just to be specific,

28:28.470 --> 28:29.789
I went to court
to delegitimize

28:29.840 --> 28:31.159
those votes.
Right.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.404
Thanks for clarifying that.

28:32.440 --> 28:33.407
Do you know Jim Moody?

28:33.440 --> 28:35.203
No. I mean, I know of him.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.332
He worked
on my husband's campaign.

28:36.380 --> 28:39.406
You never had a conversation

28:39.450 --> 28:42.476
with Jim Moody?

28:42.520 --> 28:45.910
Marilyn, I have answered
all your questions

28:45.950 --> 28:47.486
as candidly as I can.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.114
I have no idea
about this video, period.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.152
Now, I'm in the middle
of a trial.

28:53.190 --> 28:55.351
Of course.
Thank you for your time.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.059
(door opens, closes)

28:59.100 --> 29:02.467
* Won't take much
to kill a lovmg smile *

29:02.500 --> 29:04.434
* And every mother
with a baby *

29:04.470 --> 29:07.439
* Crying in her arms singing

29:07.470 --> 29:12.043
* Give me strength,
give me love *

29:12.080 --> 29:14.913
* Give me peace

29:14.950 --> 29:20.047
* Don't you know these days
you pay for everything *

29:20.090 --> 29:21.853
* Got high hopes

29:23.420 --> 29:27.220
* I got high hopes.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.198
Can you leave us, please?

29:33.300 --> 29:35.097
I'll call you back.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.579
(door closes)

29:43.610 --> 29:45.498
I was here to see
Marilyn Garbanza.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.472
(sighs)

29:47.510 --> 29:49.046
I'm sorry about that.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.547
I didn't, I didn't think
she'd be moving so fast.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.889
That video?

29:52.920 --> 29:54.888
Did you know anything about it?

29:54.920 --> 29:56.512
_ I wasn't even _aware of
its eXIstence until yesterday.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.949
I'm not talking
about its existence.

29:58.990 --> 30:02.426
I'm talking about
what it depicts.

30:02.460 --> 30:06.499
Alicia, ifI had known
what Jim Moody was up to,

30:06.530 --> 30:08.498
why would I have asked you
to disqualify those ballots?

30:08.540 --> 30:10.462
You didn't ask me.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.706
Eli did.

30:11.740 --> 30:14.573
Because he didn't know anything
about what Moody was up to.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.373
And neither did I.

30:20.110 --> 30:23.273
Zach, our son,

30:23.320 --> 30:25.049
testified in court

30:25.090 --> 30:26.387
about those ballots.

30:26.420 --> 30:27.182
I know.

30:27.220 --> 30:29.552
And he will have
to testify again.

30:29.590 --> 30:31.888
This time in front of the Feds.

30:31.930 --> 30:34.592
I hope not.

30:34.630 --> 30:36.598
No!

30:36.630 --> 30:39.565
My son will not get caught up
in the middle of this hurricane.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.568
You need _to fix this.
AllCla...

30:41.600 --> 30:45.969
Just_tell me
that you Will fix it, okay?

30:46.010 --> 30:48.137
Just tell me that.

30:50.910 --> 30:53.003
I'm gonna fix it.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.320
(knocking)

31:09.660 --> 31:11.025
Well played, Cary.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.197
(chuckles)

31:13.230 --> 31:14.561
When did you find out

31:14.600 --> 31:16.431
Haley Elliott was
his granddaughter?

31:16.470 --> 31:18.631
After we accused him
of solicitation.

31:18.670 --> 31:22.606
(both laugh)

31:22.640 --> 31:25.939
You paid the bartender
to spill the drinks,

31:25.980 --> 31:27.208
and then texted
your own phone?

31:27.250 --> 31:28.376
Yup.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.546
When did you think
to do that?

31:29.580 --> 31:31.946
Ah, not too much
before you got there.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.683
(sighs)

31:38.730 --> 31:40.925
Take care, Kalinda.

31:43.330 --> 31:46.265
So, we're even now?

31:46.300 --> 31:48.632
Yeah. Why?

31:48.670 --> 31:50.638
Then let's get a drink.

31:50.670 --> 31:52.661
So you can get one up on me?
No.

31:52.710 --> 31:55.929
'Cause I want a drink.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.944
This isn't a good idea, Kalinda.

32:00.980 --> 32:03.517
I know.

32:03.550 --> 32:04.915
So?

32:24.710 --> 32:26.735
Ryan Belfair.

32:26.770 --> 32:29.477
I'm the head of security
for the Cinque Terre Resort.

32:29.510 --> 32:32.673
Mr. Belfair,
what are we watching here?

32:32.710 --> 32:35.019
It's security video
from the sixth floor

32:35.050 --> 32:36.711
of the Cinque Terre Resort.

32:36.750 --> 32:40.117
Could you please tell us
what you see next?

32:40.150 --> 32:41.754
That's Mr. Lampe
and Ms. Riggs

32:41.790 --> 32:43.610
with Alonso Cazorla.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.218
Mr. Lampe's handing him
an envelope.

32:45.260 --> 32:47.080
Was Mr. Cazorla staying
at the hotel?

32:47.130 --> 32:49.018
He was not.

32:49.060 --> 32:52.029
So as head of resort security,
could you please explain

32:52.070 --> 32:54.630
how Mr. Cazorla got up
to Mr. Lampe's room

32:54.670 --> 32:56.365
on the sixth floor?

32:56.400 --> 32:57.765
Someone staying
at that hotel would had

32:57.800 --> 33:00.200
to have given him a key
to access the elevator.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.003
MATAN:
Thank you. Nothing further.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.007
JUDGE:
Mr. Gardner?

33:03.040 --> 33:04.075
WILL:
Mr. Belfair,

33:04.110 --> 33:06.704
you have no idea what was
in that envelope, do you?

33:06.750 --> 33:07.774
No, but I can guess.

33:07.810 --> 33:08.640
WILL: _
I'm not asking
you to guess.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.671
I'm asking
if you know.
BELFAIR:
No.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.018
Alicia...

33:13.050 --> 33:15.018
I noticed something
in the video.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.288
ROBYN:
When I talked to
the flight attendant,

33:16.320 --> 33:18.083
she was packing all
during the conversation.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.779
Now, the video that
we just saw in court?

33:19.830 --> 33:21.718
Alonso Cazorla_is
wearing a T-shirt

33:21.760 --> 33:23.057
that says
"Honey Bar" on it.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.658
It's a place
that he owns.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.019
And I remember
Ms. Barrett

33:26.070 --> 33:27.219
had a cap that
said "Honey Bar."

33:27.270 --> 33:29.192
So I went to her profile.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.060
And I found this picture.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.472
We could argue that
the flight attendant
and the coke king

33:35.510 --> 33:37.307
knew each other.
That's great work, Robyn.

33:37.340 --> 33:39.672
Now, here's a question.

33:39.710 --> 33:41.211
Should we tell them?

33:41.250 --> 33:43.309
Will and Diane?

33:43.350 --> 33:45.341
It helps us both if
we're arguing in sync.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.251
Yeah.

33:48.290 --> 33:49.484
Or could they try
to screw us?

33:49.520 --> 33:51.522
Yeah, if they want us to lose
more than they want to win.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.795
Ms. Barrett, were you in
a drug treatment facility

34:01.840 --> 34:04.809
in 2006 for addiction
to painkillers?

34:04.840 --> 34:06.159
Objection.
Relevance.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.165
She testified,
Your Honor.

34:07.210 --> 34:08.177
The jury
has a right

34:08.210 --> 34:09.279
to judge her
trustworthiness.

34:09.310 --> 34:10.800
JUDGE:
Overruled. Please answer.

34:12.410 --> 34:14.412
Yes.

34:14.450 --> 34:16.418
I was in rehab
for four months.

34:16.450 --> 34:18.145
And you've struggled
with narcotics addiction?

34:19.690 --> 34:21.248
I'm-I'm cured now.

34:21.290 --> 34:23.087
WILL:
Now, you've run up
a credit card debt

34:23.120 --> 34:26.089
that's currently $45,000...

34:26.130 --> 34:26.949
Objection, Your Honor.

34:26.990 --> 34:28.423
This is naked character
assassmation.

34:28.460 --> 34:29.449
JUDGE:
Sustained.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.161
Nothing further, Your Honor.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.394
ALICIA:
Ms. Barrett,
as a flight attendant,

34:32.430 --> 34:33.522
do you have to go
through airport security?

34:33.570 --> 34:35.492
Yes, I'm subject to
expedited screening.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.235
In fact,
at Galeao Airport

34:37.270 --> 34:38.498
you bypass security
altogether.

34:38.540 --> 34:40.201
Your bag isn't x-rayed.
It's not searched.

34:40.240 --> 34:41.377
Yes.

34:41.410 --> 34:43.173
But that's true for
every crew member.

34:43.210 --> 34:44.177
So to summarize...

34:44.210 --> 34:45.347
you have a history
of drug use,

34:45.380 --> 34:46.802
a huge debt load,

34:46.850 --> 34:48.875
the ability to bypass
airport security...
Objection.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.842
Counsel is
testifying.
...access to the
bag in question

34:50.880 --> 34:52.211
during the
entire flight...

34:52.250 --> 34:53.012
JUDGE:
Sustained.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.551
Is it true that
you planted drugs

34:54.590 --> 34:56.319
in my client's
carry-on

34:56.360 --> 34:57.349
in order to
extract it...
Objection!

34:57.390 --> 34:59.779
Your Honor!
...once they had
cleared security?

34:59.830 --> 35:01.388
(bangs gavel)
The jury will disregard

35:01.430 --> 35:03.898
Mrs. Florrick_'s entire
cross-examination,

35:03.930 --> 35:05.591
completely lacking
in foundation.

35:05.630 --> 35:07.097
You will pay it no mind.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.305
Oh, thank you.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.737
The waiting...

35:16.780 --> 35:17.804
I keep thinking
the worst.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.171
I have a good
feeling about this.

35:19.210 --> 35:20.848
ALICIA:
Me, too.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.871
Jury's back.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.842
Which one?

35:24.890 --> 35:25.879
Theirs.

35:30.820 --> 35:31.855
JUDGE:
And has the jury
reached a verdict?

35:31.890 --> 35:33.448
We have, Your Honor.

35:33.490 --> 35:37.256
JUDGE:
In the matter of Howard Lampe,
what say you?

35:37.300 --> 35:39.598
Um...

35:39.630 --> 35:41.564
actually, we're the
Darla Riggs jury.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.239
Oh...

35:44.270 --> 35:45.498
What say you?

35:47.210 --> 35:48.632
On the charge of
felony possession

35:48.680 --> 35:51.205
of a controlled substance
with intent to deliver,

35:51.250 --> 35:53.377
we find the
defendant not guilty.

35:53.410 --> 35:54.638
Oh...

35:56.320 --> 35:57.776
(laughing)

35:57.820 --> 35:59.845
JUDGE:
And it appears we have another
matter to attend to.

35:59.890 --> 36:01.653
Mr. Lampe's jury

36:01.690 --> 36:04.352
has requested that
excerpts of testimony

36:04.390 --> 36:05.379
from two witnesses be read back.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.182
What does that mean?

36:08.860 --> 36:10.896
It means they need
more information
before they decide.

36:10.930 --> 36:12.227
That's bad.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.965
Isn't it?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.332
If they need more
information, that's bad?

36:22.780 --> 36:25.408
MARILYN:
Mr. Gardner, you were the
Florrick campaign's attorney

36:25.450 --> 36:27.270
at the time of his
election, correct?

36:27.310 --> 36:29.710
No, I was one of a number of
Florrick campaign attorneys.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.286
I see.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.981
And in your capacity as
one of his attorneys,

36:33.020 --> 36:35.318
did you attempt to
invalidate a ballot box

36:35.360 --> 36:36.850
that you believed
had been compromised?

36:36.890 --> 36:38.653
I did.
And at
some pomt,

36:38.690 --> 36:40.487
did you become
aware of a video

36:40.530 --> 36:43.556
that suggested a campaign
Florrick operative

36:43.600 --> 36:45.591
tampered with
that ballot box?

36:47.400 --> 36:48.492
Do you need me
to repeat the question?

36:48.540 --> 36:49.939
Marilyn, what's going on here?

36:49.970 --> 36:51.938
I'm conducting
an investigation.

36:51.970 --> 36:53.858
An ethics investigation,
not a grand jury proceeding.

36:53.910 --> 36:55.332
I was under
the impre55ion

36:55.380 --> 36:57.268
that Eli asked you
to cooperate with me.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.819
Yes, I became aware
of a video.

37:02.850 --> 37:03.839
Thank you.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.643
And did you bring your
awareness of that video

37:05.690 --> 37:06.987
to the governor's
attention?

37:09.590 --> 37:10.557
No.

37:10.590 --> 37:12.285
No, you didn't?

37:12.330 --> 37:13.888
No, I can't answer.

37:13.930 --> 37:16.023
Any advice I gave
Governor Florrick on this matter

37:16.060 --> 37:17.755
is shielded by
attorney-client privilege.

37:20.730 --> 37:23.039
I see.

37:23.070 --> 37:24.662
Come with me, please.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.634
*

37:49.930 --> 37:51.591
(knocking at door)

37:51.630 --> 37:53.268
It's open.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.865
Marilyn.
What do you need?

37:56.900 --> 37:58.458
MARILYN:
Sir, I need you
to waive

37:58.510 --> 38:00.307
attorney-client
privilege

38:00.340 --> 38:01.807
so Mr. Gardner can
answer my questions.

38:06.810 --> 38:08.744
And... What is
the scope

38:08.780 --> 38:11.385
of the waiver
you're seeking?

38:11.420 --> 38:14.287
One that covers all matters
related to my ianIry.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.420
Um...

38:23.460 --> 38:24.961
give us a moment. Alone.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.092
(sighs)

38:26.130 --> 38:27.324
Certainly.

38:27.370 --> 38:28.439
Why?

38:29.940 --> 38:31.965
Because I want to speak
to Mr. Gardner.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.103
Anything you discuss

38:34.140 --> 38:36.973
should be part of
my investigation.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.069
I_want to talk
to him as a lavwer:

38:39.110 --> 38:40.475
a lawyer that used
to represent me.

38:40.510 --> 38:41.670
Do you understand that?

38:44.650 --> 38:45.617
I do.

38:45.650 --> 38:46.639
I'll be right
out here.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.719
If I were
to waive prIVIlege,

38:55.760 --> 38:57.591
what would your
testimony be?

38:57.630 --> 38:58.392
That I visited you

38:58.430 --> 39:00.660
in your hotel suite
on election day.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.133
That I had acquired
a videotape

39:02.170 --> 39:02.932
that I wanted
you to see.

39:02.970 --> 39:04.858
A videotape that
I refused to see?

39:04.910 --> 39:06.366
That's correct.

39:06.410 --> 39:07.365
Okay.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.037
And, uh, that would be it?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.399
No.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.704
I told you that
the video proved

39:12.750 --> 39:14.547
30,000 of your votes
were fraudulent.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.416
No.

39:17.450 --> 39:18.747
You told me you
had video evidence

39:18.790 --> 39:19.916
that I would lose
the election.

39:19.950 --> 39:21.554
Yes, that, too.

39:21.590 --> 39:22.887
Then I said,

39:22.920 --> 39:24.456
"The 30,000 votes
are fraudulent."

39:24.490 --> 39:26.481
That's not how
I remember it.
Really?

39:26.530 --> 39:27.781
And how do
you remember

39:27.830 --> 39:29.525
taking back
Diane's judgeship?

39:31.530 --> 39:33.168
(laughs incredulously)

39:33.200 --> 39:36.033
Wow.

39:36.070 --> 39:38.868
So we're headed...
we're headed that way, huh?

39:38.910 --> 39:40.502
No, I'm just
making a point.

39:40.540 --> 39:42.098
Politicians
have a way

39:42.140 --> 39:44.449
of misremembering
things to their liking.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.777
Yeah, tell me about

39:45.810 --> 39:47.038
the ethics of that,
Counselor.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.638
What could I tell

39:48.680 --> 39:50.443
the most ethical
administration

39:50.480 --> 39:51.879
in Illinois history?

39:51.920 --> 39:54.457
Do you even
hear yourself?

39:54.490 --> 39:56.082
Suspended lawyer,
man who cheats

39:56.120 --> 39:58.520
with other men's
Wives...
What do you want
me to do, Peter?

39:58.560 --> 40:00.118
Hmm?

40:00.160 --> 40:01.127
As your lawyer,

40:01.160 --> 40:03.151
what do you
want me to do?

40:12.610 --> 40:14.601
PET_ER:
Marilyn.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.899
Yes,
Mr. Governor?

40:17.940 --> 40:18.872
I have instructed
Mr. Gardner

40:18.910 --> 40:21.947
not to waive my
attorney-client privilege.

40:21.980 --> 40:23.470
Are you sure, sir?

40:23.520 --> 40:25.215
Yes.

40:25.250 --> 40:27.445
(sighs)

40:34.500 --> 40:36.627
The_S.A. is
panicking.

40:36.660 --> 40:38.560
They're afraid of walking
away with nothing,

40:38.600 --> 40:40.568
so they've
sweetened the offer.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.931
Four years.

40:41.970 --> 40:45.565
You'll be eligible
for parole in two.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.100
But do you think I can Win?

40:49.510 --> 40:51.808
I don't know.

40:54.620 --> 40:59.489
My life is probabilities.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.954
The odds of...

41:01.990 --> 41:03.617
me meeting Darla:

41:03.660 --> 41:05.753
it's two million to one.

41:05.790 --> 41:08.520
And the odds of our

41:08.560 --> 41:11.563
falling
in love:

41:11.600 --> 41:13.693
60 million
to one.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.530
What are the odds
of an acquittal?

41:19.970 --> 41:21.198
It's a coin toss.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.207
But the downside...

41:22.240 --> 41:25.141
If you were me,

41:25.180 --> 41:27.171
what would you do,
Alicia?

41:38.260 --> 41:39.227
HOWARD:
Two years.

41:39.260 --> 41:40.818
That's a lifetime.

41:40.860 --> 41:41.997
I'll wait for you, Howard.

41:42.030 --> 41:43.190
Yeah?

41:43.230 --> 41:44.219
As long as
it takes.

41:44.260 --> 41:45.227
Yeah?

41:45.270 --> 41:46.692
Yeah.

41:49.700 --> 41:52.965
* I hauled myself up

41:53.010 --> 41:55.604
* Out of a ditch

41:55.640 --> 41:58.279
* Built me an ark
It's okay.

41:58.310 --> 42:00.574
* Of gopher wood and pitch

42:00.610 --> 42:02.714
* Sat down by the roadside...

42:02.750 --> 42:05.310
"Accordingly, I am unable
to take a position

42:05.350 --> 42:06.510
"regarding the propriety of

42:06.550 --> 42:09.553
the Florrick Administration's
conduct in this matter..."

42:09.590 --> 42:11.057
Oh, come on!

42:11.090 --> 42:13.183
Your conclusion is that
you can't draw a conclu5ion?

42:13.230 --> 42:14.629
Yes.

42:14.660 --> 42:16.628
Because I didn't finish
my investigation.

42:16.660 --> 42:17.558
We made everyone
available...

42:17.600 --> 42:18.760
_ The most
important Witness

42:18.800 --> 42:19.960
refused to answer
my questions

42:20.000 --> 42:21.092
because the governor
won't waive

42:21.130 --> 42:22.097
attorney-client
privilege.

42:22.140 --> 42:23.095
What witness?

42:23.140 --> 42:24.164
Will Gardner.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.701
The Witness Who
discovered the video

42:25.740 --> 42:27.037
and tried to show
the governor.

42:27.070 --> 42:29.607
There are other reasons
why Peter won't waive.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.198
This guy has got it
out for him.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.572
He fired
his Wife...
Eli.

42:33.610 --> 42:35.646
My report is
inconclusive

42:35.680 --> 42:36.977
until I have
the governor's full

42:37.020 --> 42:39.079
and unconditional
cooperation.

42:41.220 --> 42:43.882
You're throwing this
into the laps of the Feds?

42:43.920 --> 42:45.683
No. But it might end up
in the laps of the Feds

42:45.730 --> 42:46.685
because you
don't trust me.

42:46.730 --> 42:47.685
He did nothing wrong.

42:47.730 --> 42:48.754
We won by eight points.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.688
It doesn't matter.

42:50.730 --> 42:53.221
Peter is in real trouble, Eli.

42:53.270 --> 42:56.034
He's in trouble for one reason.

42:56.070 --> 42:57.230
Will Gardner.

43:00.670 --> 43:02.672
Damn it!
