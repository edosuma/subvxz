ALEC: I have final say
in all the science we develop
and how we use it.

00:05.756 --> 00:07.041
This is it.
You and me, partner.

00:07.133 --> 00:08.248
Did you find anything?

00:08.342 --> 00:10.458
ALEC:
No Escher anywhere.
/ looked into Piron.

00:10.595 --> 00:12.802
If Escher is running it,
he's like the Great Oz.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.803
Alec.
You lost a bet, right?

00:14.891 --> 00:17.177
Right, because
smart and funny
is such a step down.

00:18.144 --> 00:21.511
Wouldn't it be a shame
to throw away your career
on a woman that no one trusts?

00:21.606 --> 00:23.312
Are you sure you don't have
some questions of your own?

00:25.818 --> 00:27.319
(INDISTINCT TALKING OVER PA)

00:27.403 --> 00:30.486
It's the 13th murder
with this profile
in the past three years.

00:30.615 --> 00:33.357
Eyes burned out,
making retinal pattern
retrieval impossible.

00:33.451 --> 00:35.112
What about WASP
surveillance?

00:35.286 --> 00:37.493
Each murder took place
outside the city confines.

00:37.580 --> 00:41.619
These fringe cases need
old-fashioned police work
to solve them.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.949
That's why I
asked for you.

00:43.127 --> 00:45.288
Sir?
Your telemetric scores
are top percentile.

00:46.005 --> 00:48.417
You have a gift for
deductive reasoning,
Cameron.

00:49.592 --> 00:51.423
Maybe a fresh
set of eyes on this.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.797

zero in on a suspect.

Ouroboros.
2009 to 2018.

01:15.493 --> 01:17.154
The snake that

01:19.121 --> 01:22.113
38 victims, all dropped off
on a circular bus route.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.539
That's how it got its name.

01:24.085 --> 01:27.168
It seems this Ouroboros killer
was also obsessed with eyes.

01:27.505 --> 01:29.041
Nice work.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.123
And, similarly unsolved.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.092
Most of the victims
were child molesters.

01:35.221 --> 01:36.802
It's a revenge killer.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.390
They're the most
fascinating, aren't they?

Ouroboros.

02:14.552 --> 02:16.759
This is your case.
Was.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.306
But I didn't catch the
killer, and the bodies
stopped showing up.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.005
Department slid it
over to cold cases.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.598
This isn't the
first victim.

02:22.685 --> 02:24.721
There were seven
more before him.

02:24.979 --> 02:27.311
Mostly men, one of
them was a woman.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.857
I figure this is a strap
to secure the victim's head

02:32.069 --> 02:34.560
while he, uh, takes
out their eyelids.

02:34.697 --> 02:37.063
Son of a bitch doesn't

while he's killing them.

02:37.450 --> 02:38.656

02:50.755 --> 02:52.871
My time, my city, my family.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.248
When terrorists killed
thousands of innocents,

02:55.384 --> 02:56.840
they were condemned to die.

02:56.927 --> 02:57.882
They had other plans.

Their plan,

03:06.354 --> 03:09.846
to corrupt
and control the present
in order to win the future.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.680
What they didn’t plan on
was me.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.165
So, in order to
prevent the future,

03:27.249 --> 03:29.456
he had to change
the present by
killing himself?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.579
Well, we all want to
believe we can change
our own destiny.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.285
Come on, I'm a sucker
for that kind of stuff,

03:33.381 --> 03:35.963
but that version of
time travel just seems
tragically flawed.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.837
There's this self-consistency
principle...
Novikov?

03:38.969 --> 03:42.132
That's it! Well,
ifyou mess with the
consistency of time,

03:42.223 --> 03:43.212
you create
a paradox, right?

03:43.307 --> 03:45.798
And it's impossible
to create time
paradoxes, mostly.

03:46.102 --> 03:47.967
We're not going to
talk about wormholes
now, are we?

03:48.062 --> 03:50.178

Mmm.

It's okay!

04:17.591 --> 04:19.843
You're doing great.
I mean it.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.468
Why don't we go
back to your place,

04:24.390 --> 04:28.133
and talk about causality
loops, see where it takes us?

there's no privacy.

Can't.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.730
What about that lab
you were talking about?

04:35.818 --> 04:38.104
It sounded nice and
quiet, private?

04:40.239 --> 04:42.025
Okay, forget I asked.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.606

too close, we both
get to keep them.

Well, we're trying to track
your father's movements

05:45.513 --> 05:47.754
in the last couple of days,
maybe you can help us out.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.298
Um, he was in and
out yesterday.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.387
I do most of the
work here now.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.218
He was more devoted
to his teaching.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.553

he was last night?
No.

05:57.233 --> 05:58.894
We led separate lives.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.267
Do you have any idea who
mightwant to harm him?

06:01.612 --> 06:03.102
Does he have any enemies
that you know of?

06:03.197 --> 06:06.439
He was a narcissist
and a perfectionist,
he was respected.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.031
He was not well-liked.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.777
What about the two of you?
Any conflict?

06:12.248 --> 06:13.613

06:15.626 --> 06:17.662
Sorry, you must think
I'm being cold.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.952
My father and I worked
together but that was

06:20.047 --> 06:21.912
the extent of
our relationship.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.373
Did you love him?

06:24.510 --> 06:25.841
He was my father.

06:26.095 --> 06:27.881
Any history of abuse?

06:28.556 --> 06:30.922
What kind of question is that?
My fatherjust died.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.802
He never touched me!
Ms. Reynolds.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.303
If there was some
sort of a schedule

06:34.395 --> 06:37.307

in the last week, that'd
be very helpful.

Pardon me?
The meeting. 35th floor.

07:21.191 --> 07:24.024
Yeah. Well, I guess I
wasn't quite what they
were looking for.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.772
KELLOG: Then they weren't
looking properly.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.603
You're Todd Sanchez.

Do we know each other?
We do now.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.777
Name's Kellog.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.786
Let's just say I'm
a big fan of microbial
reverse electrolysis,

07:35.873 --> 07:37.113
it has such potential.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.583
(STUTTERING) That's what
I keep telling them.

07:38.709 --> 07:42.748
I mean, to create electricity
and clean water simultaneously
using microbial fuel cells,

07:42.838 --> 07:44.419
this could be the future.
ltwill be the future.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.171
They only see the bottom line.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.631
The cost is greater
than the return.

07:47.718 --> 07:48.958
But one day,
you'll reduce the cost,

07:49.053 --> 07:50.714
and your technology
is going to be worth...

07:51.722 --> 07:53.053
A lot.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.680
I like your optimism,
Mr. Kellog.

07:55.768 --> 07:58.054
But, without investment...

07:58.228 --> 08:00.685
I can make that happen
for you, Todd, you name
yourpnce.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.856
I don't know,
I just met you.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.398
Why wait for the future,

08:05.778 --> 08:08.190
when the future
came looking for you?

08:10.991 --> 08:14.404
CLAYTON:
I'm afraid it's official.
All the markers are the same.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.240
CARLOS: Decamethonium?
In the blood work.

08:18.374 --> 08:22.083
Decamethonium causes
paralysis in all the
major muscle groups.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.285
Yeah. So, even ifthe
victim was conscious,

08:24.380 --> 08:26.462
he wouldn't be able to
move beyond speaking.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.877
Eyelids removed with a
scalpel, it's very precise,

08:29.968 --> 08:32.004
certainly suggests
the work of a surgeon.

08:32.096 --> 08:33.927
Or someone with
fine motor skills.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.422
And no goddamn heart.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.303
So they're alive when
he mutilates them.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.055
You read the other files?

08:41.855 --> 08:44.016
Yeah.
CLAYTON: Oh, so you
know the cause of death?

08:44.358 --> 08:47.441
Killer suffocates the victim
by forcing an unknown object
into the throat?

08:49.947 --> 08:51.357
Something about melamine.

08:52.741 --> 08:53.730
Excuse me?

08:53.992 --> 08:55.402
Have you done a
biopsy of the trachea

08:55.494 --> 08:58.236
looking for toxic
residue or cell trauma?

08:58.622 --> 09:00.738
Blunt force trauma
wouldn't cause that.

09:01.959 --> 09:02.948
Are you sure?

09:04.336 --> 09:05.792
Yeah. Pretty sure.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.338
There is no connection
that we can find

09:10.426 --> 09:12.883
between today's victim
and the previous seven.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.803
The only consistency
is the killer's MO.

09:16.557 --> 09:20.345
The disfigurement,
decamethonium,
suffocation,

09:20.978 --> 09:24.470
the early morning
discovery and the pose,

09:25.357 --> 09:27.473
each of them looking
towards the road.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.646
Anything to where
they're looking?

09:29.820 --> 09:32.152
Sometimes east,
sometimes south,

09:32.239 --> 09:33.604
there doesn't seem
to be a pattern to it.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.947
But what about the shape?

09:37.703 --> 09:39.034
It could be a circle.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.668
Wait, I see it.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.455
It's more like...

09:54.511 --> 09:59.801
More like a bunny.
(ALL CHUCKLING)

door-to-door looking for
a witness to the drop.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.802
I'll be right back.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.768
All right, since this
was a cold case,

10:08.859 --> 10:11.601
we need to re-visit all
of our previous leads.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.979
Alec? Are you there?

10:15.491 --> 10:17.402
Yeah.
Are you alone?

10:17.493 --> 10:19.199
Yeah.
Thanks for the reminder.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.735
What’s up?

10:20.871 --> 10:23.533
Only one of the worst
serial murderers this
city has ever known.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.455
Oh, yeah, I heard about
that this morning.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.123
That's grisly,
it's got like eight bodies?

10:27.503 --> 10:28.743
Try 38.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.332
KIERA: / studied this case
when / was a CPS cop.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.419
No hard leads,
no witnesses, no arrest.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.592
Well, that's good, at least
you're ahead of the killer.

10:36.845 --> 10:41.009
We found a few common threads,
but none of them were
consistent with every victim.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.548
ALEC: What about
victim's names?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.508
Maybe you can warn them
before the killer gets
to them.

10:44.603 --> 10:50.189
Except, I reviewed dozens
of cases, solved, unsolved,
it's foggy.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.813
What, the great Kiera Cameron,
foggy on details?

10:54.196 --> 10:56.061
I wasn't born with
a CMR, you know.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.362
Yeah, but you have one now.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.447
You can help Carlos

/ hope so.

11:01.912 --> 11:04.528

I'm going to explain it.

11:04.623 --> 11:05.988
You always find a way.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.448
You mean I always lie.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.001
You don’t have a choice.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.091
l have to go.

11:15.384 --> 11:16.920
You mind telling me
what's up
with this circle crap?

11:17.094 --> 11:18.209
Justanidea.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.343
Yeah, well it doesn't
make any sense.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.629
I'm trying to
help you, Carlos.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.760
What about a history
ofsexualabuse?

11:28.105 --> 11:29.311
No.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.684
Not even a few of them?

11:31.775 --> 11:33.561
We have eight
unconnected victims,

11:33.652 --> 11:37.486
eight drops all over the city,
and out of that you get
sexual abuse and a circle?

11:37.823 --> 11:40.940
Oh, not to mention you
telling the coroner how
to do his job earlier.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.278
Never mind.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.703
I think there's
something to this,

11:43.787 --> 11:46.119
the pattern, the child
abuse, that's what I...

11:47.958 --> 11:50.791
(SIGHING)
That's what I remember.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.086
Did you ever see
Groundhog Day?

11:55.173 --> 11:57.084
Bill Murray, say no more.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.838
So he's stuck in this
nightmare where he's
living the same day

11:59.928 --> 12:01.259
over and over again
until he learns

12:01.346 --> 12:03.302
something valuable
that changes him
for the better.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.558
So...

12:05.726 --> 12:08.138
I'm stuck in this nightmare
and I keep trying

12:08.228 --> 12:10.685
to learn this lesson
about being more open,

12:10.814 --> 12:13.806
but, I guess I'm not
hiding behind a computer
screen by accident.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.153
So stop hiding.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.144
Come out from
behind the screen.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.990
And if that doesn't work,

12:21.783 --> 12:23.319
let me come back
there with you.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.988
Your life is yours
to decide, Alec.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.622
I want you to come
to the lab for dinner.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.003
You're gonna cook?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.250
In a secret lab?

12:38.842 --> 12:40.423
I'm intrigued,
Mr. Heisenberg.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.466
It won't be illegal,
and it'll be great.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.215
Or, it could suck,
and we'll both end up

12:44.306 --> 12:45.466
in the hospital
with food poisoning,

12:45.557 --> 12:47.297
but at least it's a
bonding experience.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.258
What do you say?

12:58.278 --> 12:59.734
Ms. Reynolds.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.862
l have the schedule
for you, for my father.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.281
How far do you
want it to go back?

13:04.368 --> 13:05.824
He was a teacher,
wasn't he?

13:06.161 --> 13:07.241
Yes.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.536
Then I'd like a list of
his students, as well.

13:10.999 --> 13:11.988
VVhy?

13:12.084 --> 13:14.200
We have to look at
everyone in his past.

13:14.795 --> 13:18.754
Is it possible your father
was abusing his students?

13:19.216 --> 13:20.547
This again.

13:20.968 --> 13:24.335
I thought my father was
killed by someone who
murdered other people.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.303
He was.

13:26.390 --> 13:29.553
Then how can my father's
students have anything
to do with these murders?

13:30.394 --> 13:31.884
It doesn't add up.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.347
Then why
are you so upset?

13:33.438 --> 13:34.553
I'm not upset!

13:35.065 --> 13:37.021
Your questions
don't make any sense

13:37.109 --> 13:39.851
and that is a horrible thing
to say about my father.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.982
I won't give you that
list, it's private.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.777
You can't change
what happened.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.942
I think you should go.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.535
Leave!

14:02.926 --> 14:04.006
Wow.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.085
Kellog really knows
how to bait a hook.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.556
Nice upgrade.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.388
So what is it about this girl?

14:10.475 --> 14:12.090
Is she one of the suspects?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.343
Maybe, maybe not.

14:14.438 --> 14:17.851
So you really think this girl
murdered all those people
just to get back at her dad?

14:17.941 --> 14:20.182
It feels like
a stretch, but...

14:20.277 --> 14:22.268
There's something about her.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.605
So, I did some research
on melamine, it's actually
toxic stuff.

14:26.908 --> 14:30.196
They banned it after they
found it in baby formula,
plastic toys, animal feed...

14:30.287 --> 14:31.402
Could it be lethal?

14:31.496 --> 14:32.872
Enough exposure on
a cellular level

14:32.956 --> 14:35.368
can cause cancer,
but, it can't cause
suffocation.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.331
But, something made with it?

14:37.711 --> 14:38.791
Yeah, I don't know.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.373
But, I took a look
at that drug,
decamethonium,

14:41.631 --> 14:43.496
and, it's actually pretty
easy to make at home

14:43.592 --> 14:45.048
ifyou have a basic
chemistry skill,

14:45.177 --> 14:47.293
which,
Patsy Reynolds has.
Hmm.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.632
Double major,
music and biology.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.634
Yeah, she knows the
right side of a scalpel.

14:52.976 --> 14:56.560
Patsy was away for six months
between victim number seven
and her father.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.766
(CELL PHONE VlBRATlNG)
What's that?

14:59.274 --> 15:00.639
lt's Dillon.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.812
He wants to meet me alone.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.154
DILLON: Kiera.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.320
Glad you could make it in the
middle of an investigation.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.792
The invitation was intriguing.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.499
Looks like
you've landed
on your feet.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.374
I wouldn't say landed.
Not yet.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.081
Let's just say,
there are forces at work

15:26.176 --> 15:28.462
that see great value in
letting us do ourjobs.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.012
There's a hundred ways
to serve, Kiera, you
know that.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.764
Are you all right?

15:34.893 --> 15:36.133
He's waiting for you.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.261
He's got some
interesting ideas.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.699
I apologize for
the theatrics,

15:52.786 --> 15:54.902
I just wanted you
to feel at ease.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.078
EscheL
Yes.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.282
You wanted to meet?
Or did I misunderstand?

16:00.377 --> 16:02.709
No, you're right,
I have questions.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.911
I can provide answers.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.330
Where should we start?

16:08.552 --> 16:10.713
Dillon.
Other business.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.045
A convenient coincidence.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.347
I don't believe in
coincidences anymore.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.718
Because your eyes
have been opened.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.475
Because there are
agendas everywhere.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.052
What's yours?

16:21.148 --> 16:24.686
lfyou have to ask,
you're not ready
for the answer.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.060
Fine.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.106
Then tell me,
how did you do it?

16:32.409 --> 16:36.573
How did you get Agent Gardiner
off my ass that day at
the City Plaza explosion?

16:37.038 --> 16:41.657
We are still years away
from enjoying complete
surveillance.

16:41.877 --> 16:44.459
But the network's out there,
ifyou know how to use it.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.587
That's how.
I want to know why.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.414
Well, you're both
fighting the same enemy.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.752
But, I think that
our specific interests

16:53.889 --> 16:55.800
are more naturally aligned.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.800
You need a friend.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.848
And I can be a very
effective one.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.429
I'm pretty selective about
the people I call friends.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.189
What about allies?

17:06.651 --> 17:07.731
Tell me who you are.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.063
What you know.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.403
When you are from.

17:14.326 --> 17:18.490
How many people know
who you are, Kiera?

17:18.955 --> 17:20.115
Truly know?

17:29.507 --> 17:30.883
I can still see the circle.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.298
Yeah, I can't un-see it.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.050
Is there anything to it?

17:36.139 --> 17:38.471
Well, look at these drops.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.133
There's nothing coherent
about them, right?

17:41.770 --> 17:44.477
But the victims are all
staring at the road.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.022
It's like something
was coming for them.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.567
Patsy Reynolds was away
during the killer's gap year.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.904
She lives alone,
she has no alibi for
the night of the murder.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.739
You can't believe
she did this.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.327
No, not really.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.986
But there is
something about her.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.829
I know it.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.538
What does this
look like to you?

18:09.506 --> 18:10.837
Bus route?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.708
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

18:18.932 --> 18:20.172
Fonnegra.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.979
Okay, thanks.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.269
That was the coroner,

18:27.357 --> 18:29.348
said he was investigating
your crazy theory.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.191
He found traces of melamine
in the victim's trachea.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.861
Maybe my theories
aren't so crazy after all.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.906
Hey, Betty?
Mmm-hmm?

18:39.202 --> 18:41.659
See if any bus routes line up
with this circle, huh?

18:41.788 --> 18:42.994
Yeah, you got it.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.618
Come on, let's go investigate
your other crazy theory.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.205
CARLOS: Melamine.
How'd you get that?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.382
A case I know,
from the past.

18:56.136 --> 19:00.470
Forensics eventually found it,
probably transferred from
the object

19:00.557 --> 19:02.013
used to suffocate the victims.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.223
You believe this is
connected to Patsy somehow?

19:05.270 --> 19:07.010
I'm going to level
with you, Carlos.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.266
I went to see her
earlier, by myself.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.642
ltdidn't go so well.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.476
What?
I wanted to try and get
a reaction out of her,

19:13.570 --> 19:16.186
I suggested her father
may have been abusing
his students.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.399
What the hell is your problem?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.230
Look, some of the
other victims,

19:19.326 --> 19:21.988
they may have been
abusing children too,
possibly the killer.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.454
Kiera, there is
no proof of that!

19:23.538 --> 19:25.403
Imagine that there is.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.705
If you found that proof,
what would you do next?

19:27.792 --> 19:31.250
lfl had found it, then
that means there would
actually be something.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.828
I'm trying to help.
I'm sorry.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.787
Yeah, well,
you can stay sorry.
In the car.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.589
You're not coming in.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.670
Kiera, you're trying
to stop another murder.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.176
Dozens more.

19:44.392 --> 19:45.723
I can't remember
enough of this case.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.926
I'm grasping at straws,
making it harder for him.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.184
There's something about
Patsy. You need to find
out what it is.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.602
What if my interference
makes it worse?

19:53.777 --> 19:56.063
Maybe the totals go up because
I think I know something?

19:56.154 --> 19:58.361
Instead of 38 it becomes 138.

19:58.615 --> 20:01.106
Focus on Patsy.
What do you know about
her from the future?

20:01.493 --> 20:03.279
Her father, he was known.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.863
Famous, / guess.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.819
There was so much
media coverage.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.823
You still there?

20:09.959 --> 20:12.666
Alec, the media.
It wasn't because her
father was famous,

20:12.754 --> 20:15.746
it was because
Patsy was killed
shortly after he was.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.456
A father-daughter murder.
l have to tell Carlos!

20:28.311 --> 20:29.721

tying you to the bodies,

21:33.543 --> 21:35.534
your truck leaving
the crime scene,

21:35.628 --> 21:38.495
and trace DNA on Patsy from
when you tried to grab her.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.168
Still have nothing to say?

21:41.426 --> 21:42.791
lfyou had done yourjob
in the first place,

21:42.886 --> 21:45.298
none of these alleged victims
would have been killed.

21:46.723 --> 21:47.803
Really?

21:48.391 --> 21:52.009
So you want to explain
to me how your murder
spree is my fault?

21:52.479 --> 21:55.266
People do bad things.
You stop them,

21:55.773 --> 21:57.855
make them pay for
their transgressions.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.601
That makes you a hero.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.561
When I do the same,

22:03.907 --> 22:05.568
why does that
make me a monster?

22:11.498 --> 22:15.082
You staged the bodies
to be staring at the road.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.657

22:16.753 --> 22:18.084
I liked the way it looked.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.916
Look, Detective. I'm not
trying to hide anything.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.089
l've essentially confessed.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.501
And I already know
what the future holds.

22:27.263 --> 22:29.254
You're a therapist.
Yes, that's right.

22:29.349 --> 22:32.307
I run a clinic.
So you work with
abuse victims.

22:36.940 --> 22:39.602
Detective,
tell me something.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.233
How well did you
know your father?

22:42.445 --> 22:44.231
I thought you two
had no workable leads?

22:45.156 --> 22:48.239
Detective Fonnegra thought
Patsy would be able to

22:48.326 --> 22:50.783
shed some light on who might
want to kill her father.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.948
We got lucky.
Lucky.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.614
Yes, that seems to describe
a lot of your solves.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.200
Good work,
however you got it.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.378
There he is.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.801
Nice job.
Thanks, guys.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.878
Well, you're
the man of the hour.

23:10.974 --> 23:12.134
And, as man of the hour,

23:12.225 --> 23:13.510
I've got a list of
questions about this high

23:13.643 --> 23:15.599
and you're going to answer
all of them right now.

23:15.687 --> 23:18.804
First, you started in on
Patsy from the get-go.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.931
Why?
She seemed off.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.185
No, you were convinced.

23:22.277 --> 23:25.314
Now, I know you can be a bull
in a China shop sometimes,
but the way you handled her?

23:25.405 --> 23:26.611
That was way beyond that.

23:26.698 --> 23:28.609
And asking about abuse?

23:28.741 --> 23:30.356
With no evidence?

23:30.952 --> 23:32.738
Oh, and who's the perp?

23:32.829 --> 23:37.163
Just so happens to be a guy
that knows the victims and
can find the abusers.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.998
I got lucky.
Yeah?

23:40.336 --> 23:42.497
Was that luck with
the coroner, too?

23:44.215 --> 23:45.671
Nah, there's no way you
could have made those leaps,

23:45.758 --> 23:49.717
not even with the help of
your mysterious Section 6.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.259
Hell, the way I see it is,

23:51.347 --> 23:54.931
the only way you could
have known all that is if
you were in on the plan.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.179
You know that's not true.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.727
No, it's not true.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.179
But you aren't, either.

24:01.733 --> 24:05.351
Okay, if I can't trust you
then I can't be partners
with you.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.484
And I'm not sure
anyone else here will.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.530
Is that a threat?
No, that's the truth.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.654
It's just too bad
you don't recognize it.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.286
ALEC: It's not exactly
homey, but...

24:21.377 --> 24:22.628
EMILY: WOW!

24:23.379 --> 24:25.119
This is incredible.

24:27.425 --> 24:28.756
I love it.

24:29.594 --> 24:31.130
It's very you.

24:32.555 --> 24:35.217
Thank you, Alec,
for letting me in.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.059
Yeah, any time.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.133
What smells so good?

24:39.270 --> 24:42.478
Ah, lemongrass with
dragon fruit Thai basil,

24:42.565 --> 24:44.931
served in a test tube,
short ribs braised

24:45.026 --> 24:46.891
for a microsecond at
2100 degrees Kelvin,

24:46.986 --> 24:50.444
and for dessert, Yuzu snow
made with liquid nitrogen.

24:50.740 --> 24:51.980
If the lady likes.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.565
The lady does.

24:54.744 --> 24:57.577
No one's ever done
something like this for me.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.654
You deserve to feel special.

24:59.791 --> 25:02.203
You are special, and if that
just means being friends...

25:07.382 --> 25:09.964
The timing of the molecular
cooking is extremely precise.

25:10.593 --> 25:11.833
Will it taste good later?

25:11.928 --> 25:13.714
Who cares?

25:21.270 --> 25:23.010
You're going to
want to hear this.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.942
Not to put a damper
on your party,

25:30.363 --> 25:32.399
but I have an update
on Eldridge you should
be aware of.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.193
Continue your work
building the case,

25:34.575 --> 25:36.440
but he'll likely
never see sentencing.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.443
He's got cancer.
Stage four.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.821
He's not expected to live
more than a few months.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.949
Regardless, a serial
killer off the street,

25:44.210 --> 25:47.293
some much needed good PR for
the department, well done.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.919
That's fantastic.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.465
That's impossible.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.842
There has to be
a second killer!

25:58.975 --> 26:00.590
A second killer?

26:01.018 --> 26:02.633
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

26:02.770 --> 26:04.886
I need you to consider
the possibility.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.643
Kiera, Eldridge confessed.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.315
He told us everything.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.313
It's a righteous bust,
why do you want
to shit all over it?

26:11.487 --> 26:13.603
He's working with someone.
I know it.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.316
Yeah?
How do you know that?

26:17.493 --> 26:19.825
Please, Carlos.
Trust me.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.868
'Cause that's worked out
so well.

26:23.791 --> 26:24.871
Wait.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.494
Then let me explain.

26:30.339 --> 26:31.499
Okay.

26:44.145 --> 26:45.510
38 victims,

26:45.688 --> 26:47.519
laid out in a circle,

26:48.024 --> 26:49.764
that turns out
to be a bus route.

26:51.027 --> 26:53.860
The victims were mostly
child molesters.

26:54.155 --> 26:56.612
We called it the
Ouroboros case.

26:56.741 --> 26:59.357
No beginning, no end.

26:59.827 --> 27:00.942
Only death.

27:01.037 --> 27:03.153
The case was never solved.

27:04.457 --> 27:06.118
If Eldridge is
dying of cancer,

27:06.209 --> 27:08.871
he can't commit the
other 30 murders.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.168
So he has to be working
with an accomplice.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.124
If we are going
to save anyone,

27:13.216 --> 27:16.128
we have to figure out
who this second killer
is, right now.

27:16.219 --> 27:20.963
So, all of this, what,
because you're having
delusions of being a psychic?

27:24.477 --> 27:26.058
A time traveler.

27:29.065 --> 27:30.726
Look. Carlos.

27:30.900 --> 27:34.392
I know how this sounds,
but ifyou think about it,

27:34.570 --> 27:37.903
about some of the experiences
we've had that didn't feel
quite right?

27:38.074 --> 27:39.814
You know what
I'm talking about.

27:39.909 --> 27:43.242
Suppose for one second
that I am telling you
the truth right now.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.363
We could save those people
ifyou just believe me.

27:46.457 --> 27:47.617
No,no,no.
You know what?

27:47.708 --> 27:49.869
I need to save myself
from this insanity!

27:49.961 --> 27:52.668
Carlos, please.
Kiera, enough!

27:52.922 --> 27:54.503
Come on, you've never
sounded more crazy

27:54.590 --> 27:56.171
than you have
in this very moment.

27:56.384 --> 27:57.749
Are you even
listening to yourself?

27:57.844 --> 28:00.130
lfwe could look at
Eldridge's patients,

28:00.263 --> 28:02.879
his employees, anyone who had
meaningful contact with him,

28:02.974 --> 28:05.260
I know...
Stop! Okay?

28:05.768 --> 28:07.599
I really don't care
where you go, okay,

28:07.687 --> 28:11.600
I don't care what you do,
but this, this stops.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.435
We are done.

28:28.583 --> 28:29.698
What's this?

28:29.792 --> 28:33.785
Kiera asked me for a list
of employees and patients
from Eldridge's clinic.

28:34.297 --> 28:36.379
Just thought you'd
be interested.
Yeah, right.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.296
And I ran the
bus route theory.

28:39.093 --> 28:40.503
Nothing lined up.

28:40.636 --> 28:44.629
Then, I thought to check old
routes that have been
discontinued, and got a match.

28:45.099 --> 28:47.806
Turns out Eldridge's
clinic is on the same
route, and get this.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.596
It's the house
he grew up in.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.689
All right, thanks, Betty.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.480
(RINGING)

29:03.784 --> 29:05.524
Yeah, put me through
to holding.

29:18.841 --> 29:21.082
I'm Agent Cameron
with the VPD.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.259
I'd like to ask you a few
questions about the clinic
you work at.

29:24.347 --> 29:26.679
Yeah, I heard the news
reports about Dr. Eldridge.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.472
We're all in shock.
What can I do?

29:28.768 --> 29:30.383
How long have
you worked there?

29:30.478 --> 29:32.014
A couple years.

29:32.188 --> 29:35.396
| just can't believe
he could be responsible
for something so horrible.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.687
I think we both know
he's not the only
one responsible, Mike.

29:39.236 --> 29:41.318
He was working
with an accomplice.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.029
I'm going to have
to take you in
for questioning.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.150
Hey, stop!

Are we just going
to sit here and
admire each other?

30:50.057 --> 30:51.922
l was just thinking...

30:52.893 --> 30:55.680
The weird thing about
cops and killers is,

30:55.771 --> 30:58.308
we're obsessed
the same way you are.

30:58.399 --> 31:00.811
And you,
you killed pedophiles.

31:01.110 --> 31:03.772
There's not one of us alive
that doesn't understand that.

31:04.488 --> 31:08.026
On top of that,
you dedicated your life
to helping abused kids.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.867
It's incredible.

31:12.955 --> 31:14.286
| just...

31:14.373 --> 31:16.113
I gotta say thanks.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.161
Sincerely.

31:31.599 --> 31:34.136
You had 30 more
victims picked out.

31:40.858 --> 31:44.191
Each of which you were
going to drop along
your old bus route.

31:44.695 --> 31:46.606
You're hurting my hand.

31:48.199 --> 31:49.939
Who is helping you?

31:50.826 --> 31:53.488
I need to understand
who you're working with.

31:54.789 --> 31:56.495
I know someone's helping you.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.332
Come on, Eldridge,
tell me who it is.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.163
Is it an employee?

32:03.964 --> 32:05.750
Or maybe a patient?

32:07.843 --> 32:09.424
Lawyer.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.672
You're gonna need one.

32:17.978 --> 32:20.264
(EXCLAIMING)

Alec has a playmate,

32:45.631 --> 32:48.418

to do so run along.

I'll go.
No, it's not.

You're looking for these?

33:50.321 --> 33:51.902
Fascinating little device.

33:52.281 --> 33:56.320
And this other one,
like a gun handle
with no gun, very curious.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.068
You did this together.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.528
Not in the beginning.

34:01.624 --> 34:04.582
I mean, lwould have,
but Dave wanted to protect me.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.784
Keep me from the truth
of what he was doing.

34:07.588 --> 34:11.752
Butwhen I understood,
really saw the value
in his actions,

34:12.301 --> 34:14.132
I knew I had to help.

34:15.679 --> 34:19.263
Dave Eldridge was a good man,
he wanted to make them pay.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.466
lfyou think he was
such a good man,

34:21.644 --> 34:23.475
why did you stop him?

34:24.813 --> 34:27.350
There are other ways
to punish pedophiles.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.391
But first,
someone has to report them.

34:31.362 --> 34:33.227
You know what's worse?

34:34.740 --> 34:36.321
Others who keep their secrets.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.695
Patsy. Her father.

34:42.790 --> 34:45.497
She could have stopped him
from hurting those kids.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.286
She knew.

34:47.378 --> 34:48.663
But she said nothing.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.836
Dave wanted to show
Patsy her complicity.

34:52.466 --> 34:53.831
But you stopped that.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.541
So now, you're guilty.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.638
Listen to me, Mike.

34:59.181 --> 35:02.093
Dave is dying.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.850
His need for vengeance
dies with him.

35:05.145 --> 35:08.683
Until his list is complete,
he won't have any peace.

your eyes to the truth.

you to get a list of names

from Eldridge's Clinic?

down their throats.

35:48.856 --> 35:50.062
What?

35:50.357 --> 35:52.097
How did you know
about the doll?

35:52.693 --> 35:53.933
Melamine.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.809
A toxic substance.

35:55.904 --> 35:58.941
You used it on all 38 victims.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.571
There's only eight.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.456

with eyes wide open,

them like that?

them like playthings.

to take them out?

of them, Michael?

36:47.831 --> 36:49.412
This is going to hurt.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.461
(SHlVERlNG)

37:10.020 --> 37:11.226
What is that?

37:11.355 --> 37:14.518
What you see,
those are cameras.

37:14.817 --> 37:16.978
Everything I see
is being recorded.

37:17.820 --> 37:19.981
I don't believe you.
It's true.

37:20.864 --> 37:24.027
The reason I know about
the doll heads, the tech
lbroughtwith me...

37:24.868 --> 37:26.483
l have knowledge.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.905
From the future.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.666
I can prove it.

37:32.543 --> 37:34.033
My gun handle.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.670
Pick it up.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.003
Go on.

37:39.675 --> 37:41.211
What have you got to lose?

37:53.397 --> 37:54.853
Put your thumb on the grip,

37:57.192 --> 37:59.103
tap it with your index finger.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.116
Whoa.

38:12.749 --> 38:14.250
Now, shoot me.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.287
I'm not on Dave's list.

38:16.712 --> 38:21.046
You cut my eyelids,
you ruin everything
he was working for.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.374
His statement.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.381
Shoot me, and you can
finish this clean.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.474
Now, shoot me.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.896
Do it.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.861
I'm doing this
for the victims.

38:50.746 --> 38:52.077
All of us.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.579
I know.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.042
(BEEPING)

38:56.335 --> 38:57.575
Oh, shit!

38:57.753 --> 38:58.959
(GRUNTING)

39:05.969 --> 39:07.584
(GASPlNG)

39:09.264 --> 39:10.640
I'm so sorry about that.

39:10.766 --> 39:12.097
It's okay.

39:15.270 --> 39:16.885
You'll make it up to me.

39:31.453 --> 39:32.613
I'm in.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.123
CARLOS: Kiera! You here?

39:38.210 --> 39:39.700
KIERA: Down here!

39:40.045 --> 39:42.127
(PANTING)

39:50.305 --> 39:51.556
You okay?

40:02.109 --> 40:03.519
Todd!

40:03.610 --> 40:05.646
Oh, uh, hey, hi.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.194
Hey, I've been
looking for you.

40:08.949 --> 40:10.189
Never got the
signed deal memo.

40:10.284 --> 40:12.195
Right.
Right.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.406
So? When do we sign?

40:15.747 --> 40:18.204
Uh, we, uh,
we don't, I'm afraid.

40:18.292 --> 40:19.281
Todd.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.458
I thought we had
a connection here.

40:22.421 --> 40:23.831
I believe in your
technology, Todd,

40:23.922 --> 40:25.958
we are going tojump
into the future together.

40:26.383 --> 40:28.419
We were, but then
things changed.

40:28.635 --> 40:29.670
What?

40:29.761 --> 40:32.548
Look, I appreciate the belief
and your offer, but...

40:33.056 --> 40:35.593
Apparently you're not the
only one who can envision
the future.

40:37.352 --> 40:39.138
You made a deal
with someone else.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.847
That's not possible.
What's happened here?

40:43.108 --> 40:44.518
Mr. Escher happened.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.146
Who?
Piron Corp.

40:46.236 --> 40:47.817
Look, it's nothing personal,

40:47.904 --> 40:49.815
it's just Escher really
understands my vision.

40:50.532 --> 40:51.863
I'm sorry.

40:56.038 --> 40:57.198
Escher?

41:03.879 --> 41:06.165
Whoa, take it easy.

41:06.882 --> 41:10.045
I almost died in here,

41:10.927 --> 41:12.303
and it made me think.

41:13.305 --> 41:14.795
What if I had?

41:15.223 --> 41:18.260
You would have found me,
just another victim.

41:19.770 --> 41:22.227
lwould have achieved nothing.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.649
And with all the
changes l've caused,

41:25.984 --> 41:28.396
I may never come
to exist at all.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.031
Never be born,

41:32.824 --> 41:38.740
never become a soldier,
a cop, a wife, a mother!

41:38.872 --> 41:40.408
It's okay.

41:41.500 --> 41:44.833
And life,
life would continue on

41:45.921 --> 41:48.958
with nobody knowing
I had ever lived.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.424
All of my secrets,
for nothing.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.754
I don't want to keep
those secrets anymore.

41:57.641 --> 41:59.347
Kiera, you don't have to.

42:01.395 --> 42:05.013
Here, here you go.

42:05.982 --> 42:07.938
Shh, it's okay.
You're okay now.

42:09.403 --> 42:11.394
It's okay.
You believe me.

42:16.993 --> 42:19.120
The only way that you could
have known what you know

42:19.287 --> 42:20.948
is if you were working
with the killers.

42:22.499 --> 42:23.864
And that's impossible.

42:24.918 --> 42:26.783
So ifyou eliminate
the impossible,

42:27.713 --> 42:29.123
whatever is left over,

42:31.466 --> 42:33.627
however improbable,

42:36.138 --> 42:37.844
has got to be the truth.

42:39.975 --> 42:41.761
But couldn't you
have told me before?

42:42.144 --> 42:43.304
How?

42:43.437 --> 42:45.473
Well, you found
a way to lie to me,

42:46.022 --> 42:47.762
and keep lying to me.

42:48.024 --> 42:51.016
I know, and I'm sorry.

42:51.153 --> 42:52.313
It's okay.

42:53.196 --> 42:55.903
Would you ever have
believed me before now?

42:57.659 --> 42:58.990
No.

43:04.332 --> 43:05.947
Tell me everything.

43:07.335 --> 43:08.950
(SIGHING)

43:10.464 --> 43:12.170
My name is Kiera Cameron,

43:13.675 --> 43:16.462
and I came here
from the year 2077.
