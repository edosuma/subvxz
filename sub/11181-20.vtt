WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:04.314
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.452 --> 00:07.490
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.628 --> 00:12.115
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.253 --> 00:15.187
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:15.325 --> 00:18.190
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:18.328 --> 00:22.022
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.747 --> 00:26.095
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.233 --> 00:28.959
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:29.098 --> 00:31.548
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.686 --> 00:34.206
Just to get up that hill

00:34.344 --> 00:36.829
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.967 --> 00:39.384
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.522 --> 00:41.869
As long as we live
it's you and me, baby

00:42.007 --> 00:43.733
There ain't nothing wrong
with that

00:43.871 --> 00:46.494
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.632 --> 00:49.256
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.394 --> 00:53.984
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:54.123 --> 00:56.953
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:57.091 --> 00:59.887
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:00.025 --> 01:04.650
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:10.863 --> 01:14.004
Good morning, Florence.
How are you this morning?

01:15.005 --> 01:16.559
Oh, good morning,
Miss Jefferson.

01:16.697 --> 01:20.114
I didn't hear you come in
last night. It must have
been late.

01:20.252 --> 01:22.496
Yeah, about three.
Clarence took me out.

01:22.634 --> 01:26.258
Again? Looks like it's
getting serious.

01:26.396 --> 01:30.366
I'll bet he's ready to pop
the question.
He already did.

01:30.504 --> 01:33.783
He did? Oh, Florence,
what did you say?

01:33.921 --> 01:36.061
"No" and "Get your hand
off my knee."

01:40.824 --> 01:43.344
You know, I went out
with a guy like that
once,

01:43.482 --> 01:47.521
always grabbing me and
pawing at me.
How'd you stop him?

01:47.659 --> 01:48.798
I married him.

01:50.524 --> 01:52.077
Florence, what the devil's
the matter with you?

01:52.215 --> 01:54.562
How come you didn't wake
me up on time?
'Cause I overslept myself.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.978
I had a date last night.
With who?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.601
The moon wasn't even full.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.401
Where's my breakfast?
You're drinking it.

02:05.539 --> 02:07.782
Look, you don't wake me up
on time, you don't get
my breakfast.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.681
What kind of maid are you?
Underpaid.

02:11.579 --> 02:15.687
I don't know how you can
think about breakfast after
all we ate last night.

02:15.825 --> 02:17.413
Where'd you go?

02:17.551 --> 02:20.140
To a fund raising dinner
for the new wing on
Mercy Hospital.

02:20.278 --> 02:21.969
All the best people in
town were there.

02:22.107 --> 02:23.384
How come they let you in?

02:25.421 --> 02:28.009
'Cause we didn't bring you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

02:29.804 --> 02:33.670
It was real fancy, Florence.
A hundred dollars a plate.

02:33.808 --> 02:36.225
Hmm... For a hundred bucks,
I'd still be eating.

02:38.434 --> 02:42.334
Well, the money did go
to a good cause.
It went for a great cause.

02:42.472 --> 02:45.820
Getting my name in the
society column of the
East Side Chronicle.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.098
Ha! Hey, I wonder if it
came yet?

02:48.237 --> 02:51.688
I still don't understand
what's so important about
seeing your name

02:51.826 --> 02:54.795
in the society column.
Publicity, Weezy.

02:54.933 --> 02:58.074
Look, if my name's in here,
that means everybody
knows George Jefferson.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.938
I should think you'd wanna
keep that a secret.

03:01.457 --> 03:05.909
Hey, here's the story.
"New Wing, Mercy Hospital.

03:06.047 --> 03:10.293
"Mister and Mrs. Forbes,
Doctor Scott
Go-Lay-Me-Down...

03:10.431 --> 03:11.984
"Mrs. Pembrooke, Senator
Carmichael..."

03:12.122 --> 03:13.952
Hey, look at that!

03:14.090 --> 03:17.542
You found my name?
No. The supermarket's having a
half-price sale on nuts.

03:19.647 --> 03:21.994
This is a lousy paper.
Now, Weezy, now you know
we've been going to

03:22.132 --> 03:24.721
those fundraiser dinners
for weeks, and they ain't
mentioned my name once!

03:27.103 --> 03:30.002
They didn't mention me either.
That's 'cause you're black.

03:34.869 --> 03:39.391
And what are you?
I'm out two hundred bucks
'cause they bleed me white.

03:43.464 --> 03:46.226
Good morning, everyone.
Oh, hi, Tom. Come on in.

03:46.364 --> 03:49.712
Here's the casserole dish we
borrowed. Helen thought you
might need it for dinner.

03:49.850 --> 03:52.991
Oh, thank you, Tom.
Tell Helen that was very
thoughtful of her.

03:53.129 --> 03:56.166
I will. And thanks.
Why waste time?
Go tell her now.

03:57.996 --> 04:01.724
You have to excuse George.
He made a terrible
mistake this morning.

04:01.862 --> 04:04.485
Oh? What did he do?
He got up.

04:06.349 --> 04:10.560
Well, I have to be going
anyway. I'm picking up my
shotgun this morning.

04:10.698 --> 04:13.943
Shotgun?
Oh, so Helen's finally
gonna get it, huh?

04:15.600 --> 04:18.913
No, George, it's for my
new hobby. Skeet shooting.

04:19.051 --> 04:22.883
Skeet shooting?
What's a skeet?
Don't you know nothing, Weezy?

04:23.021 --> 04:24.988
A skeet is a little bird with
a long tail.

04:26.714 --> 04:31.271
No, it isn't, George.
It's a clay disk you
use in trap shooting.

04:31.409 --> 04:33.687
There are no birds.

04:33.825 --> 04:36.759
Oh, I get it. You just
imagine you got a bird.
Right.

04:36.897 --> 04:39.106
Well, why don't you just
imagine you got a gun?

04:39.244 --> 04:40.935
You know, bang! I got one!

04:42.696 --> 04:45.181
I'll explain the whole thing
later when I get the gun.

04:47.908 --> 04:52.222
Seems kind of silly, grown
men standing around
shooting at pieces of clay.

04:52.361 --> 04:55.985
I wouldn't mind doing it,
if the skeet had a picture of
that news editor's face on it.

04:56.123 --> 04:59.264
Oh, forget about that.
It's not important.

04:59.402 --> 05:00.645
Oh, yes, it is important,
too!

05:00.783 --> 05:02.578
Look, if I ain't good
enough to be in their paper,

05:02.716 --> 05:05.374
then they ain't good
enough for my advertising.
I'm calling the editor.

05:05.512 --> 05:06.996
Oh, try and stay calm,
George.

05:07.134 --> 05:08.860
Don't worry about it,
Weezy. I'm always calm...

05:12.346 --> 05:16.661
Hello? This is George
Jefferson calling. Who's this?
I don't wanna speak to you.

05:16.799 --> 05:18.387
I want the editor...

05:18.525 --> 05:21.631
Look, you tell him
he's got five seconds
to get on this phone!

05:21.769 --> 05:24.116
What's he doing?
Keeping calm.

05:26.256 --> 05:28.742
Hello, Mr. Hearst,
you're damn right
something's wrong.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.677
How come my name don't
never appear in your column?
The society column!.

05:32.815 --> 05:36.543
Uh-huh... Oh, you ain't got
enough room for everybody,
huh? Okay.

05:36.681 --> 05:39.684
Well, in that case, you ain't
got enough room for my
advertisement.

05:39.822 --> 05:46.311
Right... Say what? Oh, yeah?
Oh, good. Well, thanks. Bye.

05:46.449 --> 05:49.107
What did he say?
They're gonna send a
reporter over to talk to me.

05:53.974 --> 05:57.046
Uh, Florence, will you
put this in the kitchen,
please?

05:58.737 --> 06:01.291
Did you hear the bell?
Yeah. Didn't you?

06:05.399 --> 06:07.401
Answer the door!

06:07.539 --> 06:11.854
George, don't get so excited.
The reporter couldn't
make it here that fast.

06:13.096 --> 06:17.342
Oh, hello, Florence.
Ah, that's mental telepathy.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.792
No, it's a casserole dish.

06:20.690 --> 06:23.831
But how did you know
I was coming over to
borrow a casserole dish?

06:23.969 --> 06:25.764
Just a wild guess.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.629
Oh no, it's got to be
telepathy.

06:28.767 --> 06:32.702
My Aunt Agatha was gifted
like that. She was called in
once by Scotland Yard.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.118
Oh, they wanted her to
help solve a crime?

06:35.256 --> 06:38.467
Ah, no. They wanted her
for walking nude through
Picadilly Circus.

06:40.572 --> 06:44.852
All your family belongs
in a circus.
Thank you.

06:44.990 --> 06:47.027
But why do you want
the casserole dish,
Mr. Bentley?

06:47.165 --> 06:49.374
Oh, I'm fixing dinner for
Valery this evening.

06:49.961 --> 06:52.066
Another new girl?

06:52.204 --> 06:53.516
Oh, no, you don't understand.

06:56.036 --> 06:58.038
Ah, here's Valery now.

06:58.176 --> 07:00.834
Oh, did you find her
in the circus, too?

07:02.974 --> 07:05.355
No, Mr. J., in Russia,
Valery is a man's name.

07:05.494 --> 07:09.118
Uh, Valery Kamikov,
Mr. and Mrs. George
Jefferson.

07:09.256 --> 07:10.706
BOTH: Hi.

07:10.844 --> 07:14.537
How do you do? I am pleased
to meet you.

07:15.883 --> 07:18.783
Hey, you speak English
real good.
So do you.

07:23.063 --> 07:24.961
You see,
when I was working at
the Embassy in Moscow,

07:25.099 --> 07:28.551
Valery showed me the town.
He took me to all
the fun places.

07:28.689 --> 07:34.177
Lenin's Tomb, Stalin's Tomb...
Yeah, and now Harry is
returning the favor.

07:34.315 --> 07:37.767
Oh, yeah. And where you
gonna take him?
Woodlawn Cemetery?

07:39.528 --> 07:42.151
No, Valery's here with a
visiting trade delegation,
and I'm getting him into

07:42.289 --> 07:45.361
the U.N. tomorrow to hear
President Carter's speech.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.191
Oh, President Carter's
speaking here tomorrow?

07:48.329 --> 07:49.676
Look, Weezy, he's always
speaking someplace.

07:49.814 --> 07:51.022
That way he don't have to
do nothing.

07:52.955 --> 07:56.096
Will you be translating his
speech, Mr. Bentley?
Uh, yes.

07:56.234 --> 07:58.408
And that can be a problem
with President Carter.

07:58.685 --> 08:00.169
Why?

08:00.307 --> 08:02.171
Well, I don't know
how to translate
'y'all' into Russian.

08:04.035 --> 08:08.349
You like President Carter?
Oh, yes. He's just like
one of us.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.283
Oh...
Oh, Weezy, he ain't like
one of us.

08:11.421 --> 08:15.564
I mean he doesn't put
on airs. He even carries
his own luggage.

08:15.702 --> 08:17.531
Oh, that's true. He's a
man of the people.

08:17.669 --> 08:19.119
When he visited
Massachusetts,

08:19.257 --> 08:21.466
he stayed overnight at the
home of a beer distributor.

08:21.604 --> 08:24.331
His brother
Billy must have made
those reservations.

08:27.368 --> 08:32.304
Well, We've got to
be going.

08:35.169 --> 08:37.965
Do svidanya
Mr. and Mrs. Jefferson.

08:38.103 --> 08:40.243
And da svidan
you too, Mr. Valery.

08:41.590 --> 08:43.177
Da svidan you too!

08:44.247 --> 08:46.042
Bentley, wait!

08:46.180 --> 08:48.562
Hey, look, is this for real
about the President staying
at ordinary people's homes?

08:48.700 --> 08:50.978
Oh, yes. It was on television
and in the newspapers.

08:51.116 --> 08:53.740
He does it all the
time. He likes to get
to meet the people.

08:53.878 --> 08:56.190
Yeah? And I guess all
those people get great
publicity, right?

08:56.328 --> 08:58.779
Oh, yes. You know, I
was in the newspaper once.

08:58.917 --> 09:02.472
Weezy, I just got a
great idea.

09:02.611 --> 09:05.890
Look, since Carter's gonna
be in town tomorrow,

09:06.028 --> 09:09.169
let's ask him to stay
here overnight.
What?

09:09.307 --> 09:11.896
I'm gonna call the
President and ask him to stay
here overnight.

09:12.034 --> 09:15.382
What?
Look, Weezy, can you think of
a better way to get publicity?

09:16.141 --> 09:17.591
That's crazy!

09:19.662 --> 09:22.009
Hello, operator, I'd like to
place a long distance
phone call

09:22.147 --> 09:25.288
to the White House, please.
Yes, the one in Washington.

09:25.737 --> 09:27.187
Florence!

09:27.325 --> 09:29.051
George, have you
lost your mind?

09:29.189 --> 09:31.156
The President will never
stay here!

09:31.294 --> 09:34.608
A dry cleaner is just as good
as a beer distributor any day.

09:34.746 --> 09:38.474
What? Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll
hold. Hey, look, would you
talk to my secretary, please?

09:39.509 --> 09:40.856
Here.
I ain't no secretary.

09:40.994 --> 09:42.754
You ain't no maid, neither.
Here.

09:44.860 --> 09:46.758
Who am I calling?
The White House.

09:46.896 --> 09:50.417
The White House?
You wasting your time, child.
They do their own cleaning.

09:53.662 --> 09:56.872
Look, just tell them it's
Mr. Jefferson calling.

09:57.010 --> 10:01.014
George, you can't be serious.
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm serious.

10:01.152 --> 10:05.156
This is a great move.
Hello. Is this the White
House?...

10:05.294 --> 10:07.710
It is the White House!
I'm talking
to the White House.

10:07.848 --> 10:08.815
I'm talkin' to
the White House, y'all!

10:09.332 --> 10:10.782
See?

10:10.920 --> 10:13.509
Look. Would you just tell
them who I am!

10:15.891 --> 10:16.892
Hello...

10:18.859 --> 10:21.482
I are calling for
Mr. Jefferson.

10:23.174 --> 10:24.624
What?

10:24.762 --> 10:27.419
They said Jefferson ain't
President no more.

10:30.146 --> 10:33.218
Give me that! Move! Damn!

10:33.356 --> 10:37.257
Hello? Hello? This is
George Jefferson calling.

10:37.395 --> 10:38.810
I'd like to speak
to Jimmy, please.

10:40.709 --> 10:42.089
What do you mean,
'Jimmy who?'

10:42.227 --> 10:43.608
Jimmy President!

10:44.851 --> 10:46.542
What?
No, I don't wanna talk to you.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.302
This is personal between
Jimmy and me.

10:49.234 --> 10:51.236
Say what?

10:51.374 --> 10:54.308
He don't wanna talk?
Look here, you tell him if he
don't talk to me,

10:54.446 --> 10:57.484
I'll get him where it hurts.
I just won't vote for
him next time.

10:58.485 --> 11:00.867
You didn't vote for him
last time.

11:01.005 --> 11:03.593
Look, are you gonna put
me through or not?

11:03.732 --> 11:05.526
Okay,
you tell your boss that

11:05.665 --> 11:08.115
if that's the way he feels
about people, that this
country would be

11:08.253 --> 11:10.117
better off without him!
George!

11:10.255 --> 11:13.258
Look, Weezy, don't worry
about it. This is the way you
handle these people.

11:13.396 --> 11:14.950
That's the only language
they understand.

11:15.536 --> 11:17.435
What? Oh, you are?

11:17.573 --> 11:19.368
Oh, oh,
that's more like it, sister.

11:21.197 --> 11:22.405
Yeah, I'll be here.

11:22.543 --> 11:26.824
George Jefferson,
New York City, 555-3197.

11:27.894 --> 11:28.860
Thank you.

11:29.758 --> 11:31.552
What happened?
What did they say?

11:31.691 --> 11:35.280
Ah-ha! I did it, Weezy!
You know, they asked me
if I was gonna be here.

11:35.418 --> 11:36.834
That means he's gonna
be calling me back.

11:36.972 --> 11:38.421
No jiving?

11:38.559 --> 11:40.941
President Carter really
might stay here?

11:41.079 --> 11:43.944
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, I've gotta tell Tom
and Helen.

11:44.082 --> 11:46.602
Hold it, hold it, hold
it, look, if the President
wants to see zebras,

11:46.740 --> 11:47.914
he can go to the zoo.

11:51.780 --> 11:53.471
We better get this place
straightened up.

11:53.609 --> 11:57.406
You're right. I don't want
him telling Rosalynn I
keep a messy house.

11:57.544 --> 11:59.408
Oh, yeah, you better get
a cleaning lady in here,
Weez.

12:04.689 --> 12:06.518
I just cleaned yesterday.

12:06.656 --> 12:08.520
Rearranging the dust
ain't cleaning.

12:10.626 --> 12:12.317
Get a caterer, too.

12:12.455 --> 12:13.940
Oh, I don't know, George.

12:14.078 --> 12:17.253
I read the President likes
plain food.
I can cook plain food.

12:17.391 --> 12:18.979
Yeah, plain awful.

12:20.601 --> 12:22.845
Well, if I can't clean,
and I can't cook,

12:22.983 --> 12:24.813
I guess
I'm just in the way
around here, huh?

12:24.951 --> 12:27.816
I've been telling you that
for two years now.

12:27.954 --> 12:29.300
That's enough, George!

12:29.438 --> 12:30.853
You said it, Miss Jefferson.

12:32.821 --> 12:36.479
Florence, where are you going?
Out! I'm taking the rest of
the day off!

12:36.617 --> 12:38.205
How will we know
the difference?

12:40.829 --> 12:43.693
I sure will be glad when the
President gets here,
Mr. Jefferson.

12:43.832 --> 12:46.420
It'll make history.
You're damn right it will.

12:46.558 --> 12:50.355
It'll be the first time
the Democratic donkey stayed
with a Republican jackass.

12:57.846 --> 13:02.057
George, you should be
ashamed of yourself.
You insulted her.

13:02.195 --> 13:04.335
Don't worry about it,
Weezy, she'll get over it.

13:04.473 --> 13:07.027
Well, when she comes back,
you're going to apologize.

13:07.165 --> 13:10.928
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look, hey,
I got a lot of good ideas
to give the President.

13:11.066 --> 13:14.794
Oh, really? Like what?
Well, you know, things that
are gonna help the country.

13:14.932 --> 13:19.971
Like peace in the Middle East,
a job for everybody,
tax cuts for dry cleaners.

13:22.008 --> 13:26.667
George, you're a real patriot.
I try my best.

13:26.806 --> 13:31.327
Yeah?
Morning, sir. Agents Allen
and Neil, Secret Service.

13:31.465 --> 13:33.295
Secret Service?
Are you George Jefferson?

13:33.433 --> 13:35.573
Yeah, that's right.
Then you're the man we want.

13:35.711 --> 13:37.782
Me? For what?

13:37.920 --> 13:40.854
For threatening the President
of the United States.

13:52.866 --> 13:57.008
Sit down, Mr. Jefferson,
we have several questions
we wanna ask you.

13:57.146 --> 13:59.148
What do you mean I
threatened the President
of the United States?

13:59.286 --> 14:01.047
What kind of a nut do
you think I am?

14:01.185 --> 14:03.981
If you answer the questions,
maybe we'll find out.
Who are you calling a nut?

14:04.119 --> 14:06.984
It'll be a lot easier
on you, Mr. Jefferson, if
you just cooperate.

14:07.122 --> 14:09.227
Look, it'll be a lot
easier on me if you
just leave.

14:09.365 --> 14:13.059
Uh, now, wait a minute.
There must be some
mistake here.

14:13.197 --> 14:15.613
Aren't you the George
Jefferson who called the White
House this morning?

14:15.751 --> 14:17.235
No. My maid did.

14:17.373 --> 14:18.996
I see.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.308
And why did you
make the call?

14:27.832 --> 14:30.939
I'm not the maid.
I'm his wife.

14:31.077 --> 14:32.043
Oh, where's the maid?

14:32.181 --> 14:34.183
She went out.
What's her name?

14:34.321 --> 14:36.910
Florence Johnston.
Can you describe her?

14:37.048 --> 14:39.568
Yeah. Just picture Dracula
with earrings.

14:41.708 --> 14:44.055
Mr. Jefferson, this is
serious business.

14:44.193 --> 14:48.128
The White House notified our
field office while you were
still on the phone.

14:48.266 --> 14:52.098
Did you say,
referring to the President,
"I'll get him where it hurts"?

14:52.236 --> 14:53.478
Oh, yeah...

14:53.616 --> 14:55.549
"And this country would be
better off without him?"

14:55.687 --> 14:59.105
My husband said those things,
but he didn't mean any harm.

14:59.243 --> 15:03.972
Right, look, I wasn't
threatening the President,

15:04.110 --> 15:06.146
I was threatening
the operator.

15:06.284 --> 15:10.219
I mean, I wasn't threatening
nobody. Look, would you guys
just leave me alone?

15:10.357 --> 15:14.637
As soon as we get
some answers.
Okay, ask me some questions.

15:14.775 --> 15:17.192
Mr. Jefferson, do you have
the feeling that the
government

15:17.330 --> 15:18.710
has done something to you?

15:18.848 --> 15:20.954
Of course not. The government
don't do nothing for nobody.

15:25.510 --> 15:28.858
Mr. Jefferson, what
we're trying to determine is,

15:28.997 --> 15:33.518
do you feel you're getting
a raw deal somehow?
I mean, you are black.

15:33.656 --> 15:35.279
Man, these guys don't
miss a thing, huh?

15:39.559 --> 15:42.665
Uh, George, I don't think
you should be playing games
with them.

15:42.803 --> 15:45.737
Then tell them to get out of
here! I got enough problems
without worrying about them!

15:45.875 --> 15:47.187
Shoot.

15:47.325 --> 15:51.467
Say, Mr. Jefferson,
do little things often make
you mad?

15:51.605 --> 15:54.298
Oh, sure. You know,
I lose my temper every once
in a while.

15:54.436 --> 15:57.266
Everybody does.
Uh-huh. Of course, some days
are worse than others.

15:57.404 --> 16:00.476
Yeah, that's right. You know,
some days you have
to talk to idiots morning,

16:00.614 --> 16:02.444
noon, and night.
Now that's the worst part.

16:02.582 --> 16:04.687
Yeah, then by the end
of the day, you're so
mad you wanna,

16:04.825 --> 16:06.172
you wanna get rid
of all of them!

16:06.310 --> 16:10.003
Yeah, that's right! Oh, you
get that way, too, huh?

16:10.452 --> 16:11.418
No, never.

16:13.213 --> 16:17.217
Neither do I. Hey, don't
write that down.
Oh, relax, George.

16:17.355 --> 16:19.909
How can I relax,
with these two goons
hanging around here?

16:20.048 --> 16:22.602
They shouldn't even be
in here. This is my house.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.673
Look, I'm a taxpayer and
I'm a citizen.

16:24.811 --> 16:27.641
Hey, wait a minute. I pay
your salary, right?

16:27.779 --> 16:28.746
That's right, sir.

16:28.884 --> 16:29.989
Well, you're fired!

16:36.823 --> 16:40.068
I should have known
that phone call was
gonna be trouble.

16:40.206 --> 16:45.107
Mr. Jefferson, we're
just doing our job. Before
the President goes anywhere,

16:45.245 --> 16:49.732
the Service checks its list on
anyone in the area who
might be a threat.

16:49.870 --> 16:52.080
And thanks to your phone
call, you made the list.

16:52.218 --> 16:57.602
Well, congratulations, George.
You finally got your name
mentioned somewhere.

16:57.740 --> 17:00.709
So, I hope you understand
we can't take any chances.

17:00.847 --> 17:03.022
We have to check
every nut in the area.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.680
He said it again! He
called me a nut! Look, what
does it take to make

17:06.818 --> 17:10.339
you guys listen, huh?
Believe me, we're listening to
everything you say.

17:10.477 --> 17:14.274
I tell you, I'm not a nut! I'm
not a nut! I'm not a nut!

17:15.482 --> 17:17.346
Weezy,tell these
guys I ain't crazy!

17:23.387 --> 17:25.320
I'm gonna have you jailed
for this.

17:25.458 --> 17:30.566
Look, the only reason George
made that call was to get the
President to stay here.

17:30.704 --> 17:34.122
It was just a publicity
gimmick for his cleaners.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.296
You mean you don't have
anything against President
Carter?

17:36.434 --> 17:39.230
No, I like him.
But what do I know? I
like Nixon, too.

17:41.543 --> 17:44.856
Well, we'd like to believe
you, but it would help
if the maid was here

17:44.994 --> 17:45.995
to back up your story.

17:47.376 --> 17:48.550
If there is a maid.

17:48.688 --> 17:51.311
Look, I didn't say she
was a good maid.

17:51.449 --> 17:54.901
Normally, she'd be here
right now, wouldn't she,
George?

17:55.039 --> 17:57.524
If she hadn't had
an argument with someone.

17:59.526 --> 18:02.322
Uh, see that's got to
be Florence now. Now you're
gonna see what a big

18:02.460 --> 18:05.014
mistake you made. I'll tell
you, I'm the most red,
white and blue apple pie

18:05.153 --> 18:07.016
American you ever
seen in your entire life.

18:08.328 --> 18:12.091
Jefferson!

18:12.850 --> 18:14.541
Not now, Valery.

18:14.679 --> 18:18.821
I just came from a...
Oh, excuse me. I didn't know
you had guests.

18:18.959 --> 18:22.480
And who are you?
Valery Kamikov,
Soviet Union.

18:22.618 --> 18:27.036
Andrew Neil, Secret Service.
George Jefferson, dead duck.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.317
The guy's a Commie.
I think we really got
something this time.

18:31.455 --> 18:34.285
Wait a minute. Hold it,
Jack. Look, before you start
thinking of something crazy,

18:34.423 --> 18:37.116
I never saw him before today.
I don't even know him!

18:37.254 --> 18:41.499
Oh, sure you do.
Don't you remember?
I was here before.

18:41.637 --> 18:45.538
I had left my gloves. See?
Yeah, that's right. He just
came here to leave his gloves.

18:45.676 --> 18:50.025
No, no, no, don't you
remember? We talked about
President Carter.

18:50.163 --> 18:55.479
Yeah. And I said I liked
President Carter, right?
No, you didn't.

18:59.379 --> 19:03.142
He didn't like President
Carter?
His wife did, I think.

19:03.280 --> 19:07.284
Oh, oh, believe me, this
is all a misunderstanding.

19:07.422 --> 19:10.287
Valery, will you please tell
them what you are doing
in New York?

19:10.425 --> 19:13.773
And get to the point, huh?
Just a minute. Just a
minute!

19:13.911 --> 19:16.638
I am good Soviet citizen.
I show you!

19:19.227 --> 19:20.193
Frisk him!

19:23.162 --> 19:24.508
What are you doing?
What is this? What is this?

19:24.646 --> 19:27.131
Oh, excuse me.
Have you seen my friend?

19:27.269 --> 19:31.308
Oh, Valery, there you are.
Oh, Harry, thank goodness.
Harry.

19:35.553 --> 19:38.901
Whoareyou?

19:39.039 --> 19:43.458
I'm Harry Bentley. I live
next door. I can vouch
for Mr. Kamikov.

19:43.596 --> 19:47.703
Never mind him! Vouch for
me! These guys are Secret
Service agents.

19:47.841 --> 19:50.292
They think I threatened
the President.
Oh, my goodness.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.052
Mr. J, why did you do that?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.160
I didn't do it, Bentley!

19:56.298 --> 19:59.543
You say you know this Russian?
Oh, very well. In fact, we
were on our way to the U.N.

19:59.681 --> 20:03.305
to reserve him a good seat,
so he can't possibly
miss the President tomorrow.

20:03.443 --> 20:06.377
That's it. Frisk him.
Oh, please... Oh, please...

20:10.278 --> 20:15.731
Wait! You're making a big
mistake. Mr. Bentley
is a translator at the U.N.

20:15.869 --> 20:17.492
Yes, here's my certification.

20:21.944 --> 20:23.981
I have top security clearance.

20:24.119 --> 20:28.606
So does Mr. Kamikov.
It's true, it's true. I'm with
Russian trade delegation.

20:28.744 --> 20:30.988
Look at this...

20:32.852 --> 20:34.371
That's easy enough
to check out.

20:34.509 --> 20:37.339
Hey look, I ain't talking
no more till I! talk
to my lawyer

20:37.477 --> 20:39.307
We're all
being railroaded!

20:39.445 --> 20:41.792
Don't worry.
You'll get a fair trial.

20:41.930 --> 20:44.139
Yeah. Then the firing squad.

20:44.277 --> 20:47.073
Is typical
imperialist tactics.

20:47.694 --> 20:49.386
Oh...

20:49.524 --> 20:53.493
Will you please
stop talking like that?
We're all innocent.

20:53.631 --> 20:55.392
We have nothing to
worry about.

20:59.913 --> 21:01.121
Do we?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.709
We'll soon find out.

21:02.847 --> 21:05.402
Okay, thanks. That's
what I wanted to know.

21:05.540 --> 21:06.713
These guys check out.
They're all right.

21:06.851 --> 21:07.921
GEORGE: Hey, great.

21:08.059 --> 21:11.925
Not you. Them.
Good day, gentlemen.

21:12.340 --> 21:13.996
Do svidanya.

21:14.134 --> 21:17.966
Hey, did you see that?
He let the white guys go.
Even the red one.

21:22.453 --> 21:24.248
You know, I think the
guy's probably okay.

21:24.386 --> 21:25.939
I'd still like to talk
to that maid.

21:26.077 --> 21:28.425
Look, he's right.
You're wasting your time
here, man.

21:28.563 --> 21:30.185
I'm the most nonviolent
person you ever wanna meet.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.635
All right, George,
here's the gun!

21:34.914 --> 21:36.605
Oh, oh, don't hurt me.
You can have anything
you want.

21:36.743 --> 21:40.299
Take my wallet, my credit
cards. I'll write you
a check.

21:40.437 --> 21:43.509
Take it easy, we're the
Secret Service.
Secret Service?

21:43.647 --> 21:46.788
What did you do, George?
Threaten the President?

21:47.375 --> 21:48.341
Shut up, fool!

21:51.137 --> 21:52.725
Who are you?

21:52.863 --> 21:56.280
My name is Thomas H.
Willis. I, I live upstairs.

21:56.418 --> 21:59.525
That's only a skeet gun.
Well, I think we should
take them both downtown.

21:59.663 --> 22:03.839
Oh... I forgot my
pocketbook. I won't be
starting no fighting.

22:03.977 --> 22:08.188
Hey, there's Florence!
Come back. C'mere, I need
you. This is my maid.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.811
Is that true?
You the maid?

22:09.949 --> 22:11.088
I'm anybody you want
me to be.

22:13.953 --> 22:17.853
You don't have to be
scared, Florence. These men
are government agents.

22:17.991 --> 22:21.892
They just wanna find out
why George called the
President this morning.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.928
That's right, miss. And unless
you can verify his story,

22:24.066 --> 22:25.965
we're gonna have to take him
down for questioning.

22:26.103 --> 22:28.312
You mean it's up to me whether
they take you in or not?

22:28.450 --> 22:29.417
Yeah!

22:33.144 --> 22:35.526
Hey look, would you
just tell them why I made
that call?

22:35.664 --> 22:37.563
You want me to get
you off the hook?

22:37.701 --> 22:40.738
The same me
who got thrown out of
here for being in the way?

22:40.876 --> 22:44.363
Florence...
What first made you
suspicious of him?

22:44.501 --> 22:46.019
Was it them
little beady eyes?

22:47.642 --> 22:49.298
Will you just tell them?

22:49.437 --> 22:53.682
I'm trying to remember,
Mr. Jefferson. But I need
something to jog my memory.

22:53.820 --> 22:57.445
Maybe if I had a sandwich.
What? Hey, look, the
sandwich can wait!

22:59.999 --> 23:01.932
Well, your apology can't.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.521
Okay, I'm sorry, Florence.

23:04.659 --> 23:05.625
I'm a good maid.

23:06.868 --> 23:07.869
You're a good maid.

23:08.007 --> 23:09.111
And a good cook.

23:09.249 --> 23:10.458
And a good cook.

23:10.596 --> 23:13.115
And I get a 20
dollar raise.
No way.

23:15.048 --> 23:16.947
Okay, I'll visit you
every month.

23:17.085 --> 23:20.053
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Hold
it, hold it. I'll make it ten.

23:20.191 --> 23:21.676
Why thank you,
Mr. Jefferson.

23:22.746 --> 23:24.610
Mr. Jefferson only
made that phone call

23:24.748 --> 23:26.405
'cause he wanted the
President to stay here.

23:26.543 --> 23:28.476
He thought it would be
good advertising for
his business.

23:30.650 --> 23:33.998
It checks out all right.
See? I told you.

23:34.861 --> 23:36.863
Yes?

23:37.001 --> 23:39.935
I'm Dean. East Side Chronicle.
My editor sent me over to talk
to a Mr. Jefferson.

23:40.073 --> 23:43.767
Oh, yeah, that's me.
Hey, it's about time.
Come on in here.

23:43.905 --> 23:47.184
This was to be a private
interview. I didn't realize
there'd be a party going on.

23:47.322 --> 23:50.670
Believe me, this is
no party. These are
Secret Service men.

23:50.808 --> 23:53.052
Secret Service?
Why are you guys here?

23:53.190 --> 23:55.123
Oh, it's silly, really.

23:55.261 --> 23:58.713
They thought George
threatened the President.

23:58.851 --> 24:00.922
What are you writing that for?
I'm a reporter.

24:01.060 --> 24:04.270
So what? I'm a dry cleaner.
You don't see me
cleaning your clothes, do you?

24:04.408 --> 24:06.548
Hey, where are you going?
To get my camera.

24:06.686 --> 24:09.551
You're gonna do better
than the society page,
Mr. Jefferson.

24:09.689 --> 24:11.726
I'm gonna put you
on the front page.

24:11.864 --> 24:15.661
What?
"Local Dry Cleaner Threatens
President". Wow!

24:15.799 --> 24:18.249
Hey, wait a minute. You
can't print that. Hey!

24:18.387 --> 24:20.355
If I see my name in
your paper, I'll kill you!...

24:25.153 --> 24:26.395
Joking, just joking.

24:49.936 --> 24:53.457
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was videotaped in front
of a studio audience.
