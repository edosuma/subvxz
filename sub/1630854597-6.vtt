You gotta make Mama happy.

00:58.925 --> 01:01.294
All right, Chef. Send out those boxes.

01:02.495 --> 01:06.766
<i>It's the ultimate cooking competition,</i>
<i>where skill meets strategy.</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:08.435
Let me get my buzzer fingers ready.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.904
<i>This is </i>Cook at all Costs.

01:13.339 --> 01:14.841
-Y'all ready?
-Yeah!

01:14.908 --> 01:18.411
-Let's go, Jordan. Let's go!
-Let's do it. Let's go!

01:18.478 --> 01:22.682
Danica, Seth, Matt,
welcome to <i>Cook at all Costs.</i>

01:22.749 --> 01:23.583
Whoo!

01:23.650 --> 01:26.219
Let's get started
with your first challenge. In this round,

01:26.286 --> 01:28.655
you'll be creating dishes
in any style you like,

01:28.721 --> 01:31.357
using ingredients
that are being prepared behind us

01:31.424 --> 01:34.027
in the back pantry
by today's guest chef and judge.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.764
He's a James Beard-nominated food writer
and cookbook author,

01:37.831 --> 01:41.101
whose cooking celebrates
the best in Mexican culture and cuisine.

01:42.202 --> 01:43.636
Chef Rick Martinez.

01:43.703 --> 01:46.106
-Let's go!

01:46.172 --> 01:48.208
Chef Rick <i>is</i> Mexican food.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.342
He's an icon.

01:49.409 --> 01:52.979
I've been a fan of his for a long time,
so it's an honor to cook for him today.

01:53.046 --> 01:56.883
Chef Martinez, please send out
those ingredient boxes.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.192
Using your bank of $25,000,

02:06.259 --> 02:09.362
you will blind bid
on these three ingredient boxes.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.563
Whoever bids the highest

02:10.630 --> 02:11.898
gets the Spend Box,

02:11.965 --> 02:15.168
which has premium ingredients
that can be turned into premium dishes.

02:15.235 --> 02:18.037
The home cook with the lowest bid
gets the Save Box,

02:18.104 --> 02:21.074
which has common ingredients
that you'll need to get creative with

02:21.141 --> 02:22.575
and turn into amazing dishes.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.111
And the other cook gets a surprise.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.615
The Surprise Box contains
more exotic items,

02:28.681 --> 02:31.017
and it will force you
to think outside of the box.

02:31.084 --> 02:34.254
And that's where the strategy comes in.
Because, in the end,

02:34.320 --> 02:37.790
the winning cook gets to keep
whatever cash is left in your bank.

02:41.227 --> 02:43.863
The minimum bid is $2,500.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.199
Please, put your bids in now.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.236
I am super competitive.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.272
My strategy is to bid high.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.307
I don't care how much money I leave with.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.476
I want the best possible ingredients.

02:57.644 --> 03:01.247
I'm a budget guy in life,
but I really want the Spend Box.

03:01.814 --> 03:05.385
I really want to make my mark.
I've got to risk it to get the biscuit.

03:06.586 --> 03:10.056
All right, let's reveal
those bids. Danica.

03:11.324 --> 03:15.461
Five thousand dollars.
Someone's trying to spend.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.396
Here to win.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.998
-That's a lot of rent.
-Right? That's a mortgage payment.

03:19.065 --> 03:20.533
Seth, your bid was…

03:21.634 --> 03:23.169
$2,700.

03:23.236 --> 03:25.438
I'll make miracles
with any of those boxes.

03:25.505 --> 03:26.873
I like that confidence, Seth.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.710
And Matt, let's take a look
at your bid, $3,801.

03:32.178 --> 03:35.682
Danica, you have the highest bid,
which means you get the Spend Box.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.851
Seth, you get the lowest bid,
which means you get the Save Box.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.888
And Matt, seems like
you're in for a surprise.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.656
-I love surprises.
-I hope so.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.091
Bring it on. Let's go.

03:46.459 --> 03:49.362
You have 45 minutes
to make your best out-of-the-box dish

03:49.429 --> 03:50.697
in any style you like.

03:50.763 --> 03:51.864
Okay.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.200
And be ready,
because Chef Martinez has

03:54.267 --> 03:56.169
plenty of ingredients
to send down the line

03:56.236 --> 03:57.570
to help upgrade your dishes.

03:57.637 --> 04:00.006
Danica, Seth, Matt,

04:00.073 --> 04:01.874
are you ready to cook at all costs?

04:01.941 --> 04:02.909
-Yes!

04:02.976 --> 04:04.277
-Let's do it!
-Let's go!

04:04.344 --> 04:07.280
Good. 'Cause your time starts… now!

04:09.148 --> 04:10.550
Excuse me.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.753
-This is my workout for the day.
-Okay, this is heavy.

04:16.422 --> 04:20.059
I get the Save Box. Tilapia fillets, mayo.

04:20.627 --> 04:24.364
We got cream of mushroom,
pickled asparagus.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.699
I'm here to cook.
I'm here to play the game,

04:26.766 --> 04:29.002
but more so than anything,
I'm here to be creative.

04:29.068 --> 04:30.670
Where are we gonna start?

04:30.737 --> 04:33.673
But this box is
like from when I was broke in my 20s

04:33.740 --> 04:37.410
and I first started cooking
with ingredients from the dollar store.

04:37.477 --> 04:42.515
I got tilapia, white potatoes,
canned cream of mushroom.

04:42.582 --> 04:45.084
What am I supposed to do
with cream of mushroom soup?

04:45.585 --> 04:47.620
I have the Spend Box.

04:47.687 --> 04:50.290
Potatoes. Oh my God, bluefin tuna. Wow.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.491
Asparagus.

04:51.557 --> 04:52.925
Ooh, mushrooms!

04:52.992 --> 04:56.362
I have shiitake mushrooms,
Fresno chilies, shallots.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.498
There are some
really great ingredients in here.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.366
Oh, wow! It's really pretty.

05:00.433 --> 05:03.603
I see the tuna,
and right away I am pumped.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.972
It's a perfect thing to eat raw.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.107
You can't cook
such a beautiful fish like that.

05:08.174 --> 05:09.676
You have to leave it as is.

05:09.742 --> 05:12.312
So, I'm thinking a crudo,

05:12.378 --> 05:16.149
but I need citrus.
I need lemon, I need lime,

05:16.215 --> 05:19.152
something to make the crudo pop.

05:20.853 --> 05:24.123
Skate wing, frozen hash brown patties,

05:24.190 --> 05:25.892
some mushrooms,

05:25.958 --> 05:28.928
white asparagus and hot sauce.

05:28.995 --> 05:32.098
What in the world am I gonna do with this?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.934
This Surprise Box is a killer.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.369
Skate wing.

05:37.904 --> 05:38.738
Skate wing?

05:39.806 --> 05:41.607
I like buffalo wings. This could work.

05:42.942 --> 05:43.843
Okay, it's fish.

05:43.910 --> 05:46.012
Did not know that.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.882
It's fish that I don't know
how to break down.

05:49.949 --> 05:52.151
There's like a fiber
or something in there.

05:52.218 --> 05:54.187
I really don't know what to do with this,

05:54.253 --> 05:56.656
so I put it to the side
and start working on other stuff.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.591
I got nothing going on right now.

05:59.625 --> 06:01.627
Home cooks, we've seen
all of your ingredients,

06:01.694 --> 06:03.029
and you all have fish.

06:03.696 --> 06:07.667
There's bluefin tuna in the Spend Box,
skate wing in the Surprise Box,

06:07.734 --> 06:09.369
and tilapia in the Save Box.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.270
Now, what are you going to do with it?

06:11.337 --> 06:13.473
-Jordan, what would you do?
-Nice try.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.375
I'm a strategist, man. Come on.

06:15.441 --> 06:16.809
I'm a culinary entertainer.

06:16.876 --> 06:20.179
I have hosted
a laundry list of digital series,

06:20.246 --> 06:23.149
but I'm self-taught.
I don't have any training whatsoever.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.284
I'm here
because I wanna show off what I got.

06:26.619 --> 06:29.989
I have this cream of mushroom soup,
so I'm thinking, "I can make a sauce,"

06:30.056 --> 06:32.225
you know, to smother the fish.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.127
I also have white potatoes,

06:34.193 --> 06:36.963
I gotta roast 'em off,
and I'm going to mash 'em.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.365
I'm gonna fold in some
of that Japanese mayo.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.733
Try to get creative as possible.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.502
There we go.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.873
-Chef.
-Jordan!

06:46.939 --> 06:48.941
-How's it going?
-Good. Good to see you.

06:49.008 --> 06:51.210
Good to see you too.
Those boxes are intense.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.813
I'm really excited to see
what they do to those boxes.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.948
There's a lot of stuff in there
you can have fun with.

06:56.015 --> 06:59.385
So, I saw in the Save Box,
there's, like, cream of mushroom.

06:59.452 --> 07:02.555
Yeah, I think you have to, like,
just recognize that it's not a soup.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.223
You need to turn it into a condiment--

07:04.290 --> 07:06.159
-Mm-hmm.
-…or a sauce, or something else.

07:06.225 --> 07:09.162
-I wanna see creativity. Sky's the limit.
-Of course. Of course.

07:09.228 --> 07:10.930
I-- So, I saw skate out there.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.266
-Love skate. Oh, my God.
-I love skate, but-- Okay.

07:13.332 --> 07:16.869
You and I both know, not necessarily
the easiest fish to prepare.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.372
No, it's thin,
so it doesn't take a lot of cook time,

07:19.439 --> 07:22.742
but the texture is
so beautifully smooth and buttery.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.577
-I was just gonna say, buttery.
-Exactly.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.212
It definitely is a delicate fish.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.381
You don't wanna apply
too much heat, or if you do,

07:28.448 --> 07:31.050
hit hard, sear,
really get that nice caramelization.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.919
All right, what are you
preparing right now?

07:32.985 --> 07:35.521
So, this is salmon
which I've just portioned out.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.256
-I love a good salmon.
-Definitely.

07:37.323 --> 07:40.126
Chef, this all looks great.
I'm gonna go check in with the home cooks.

07:46.032 --> 07:48.568
We got some plans going now.
Into the fryer, let's go.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.571
I have a YouTube channel
called "Balding on a Budget."

07:51.637 --> 07:53.139
Aptly named, obviously.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.807
I like to explore recipes

07:54.874 --> 07:57.643
and see, "What ingredients
can I replace with something cheaper?"

07:57.710 --> 07:59.979
My secret weapon
in the kitchen is my creativity

08:00.046 --> 08:01.447
when it comes to ingredients.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.783
From the start,
looking at the Surprise Box,

08:03.850 --> 08:05.551
I know that I'm making vegetable hash.

08:05.618 --> 08:06.719
We are chopping you up.

08:06.786 --> 08:10.423
I have potato product
and white asparagus,

08:10.490 --> 08:14.727
things that can take a lot of cooking,
and soften up and mesh well together.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.196
So I know that's gonna be my base.

08:17.263 --> 08:19.665
The problem is
what am I gonna put on top of it?

08:19.732 --> 08:22.468
I don't have a protein that I understand,

08:22.535 --> 08:25.404
so I need something else
and I need it now.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.777
Something's coming out. Got action.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.114
Red light is flashing.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.817
-What we got, Jordan?
-That means we got an auction coming.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.953
What are we going to get?
I need something. Come on, Jordan.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.188
My box sucks.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.923
Did I… Did I mention that?

08:44.557 --> 08:47.260
I see those golden cloches
coming down the line.

08:47.326 --> 08:48.761
It's time to elevate my dish.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.264
This is your chance
to upgrade your dishes.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.798
Give me a protein I recognize.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.369
Home cooks, let's get it started.

08:56.435 --> 09:01.374
First auction item up for bid
will remain a secret till after you bid.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.675
Blind bid.

09:03.242 --> 09:07.046
Home cooks, this I guarantee
can elevate any dish.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.515
I'm going to start
the opening bid at $800.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.050
-$800.

09:11.117 --> 09:13.019
We all love a little bit of mystery.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.121
Do I have $1,000
for this secret ingredient?

09:15.187 --> 09:17.056
-Seth, $1,000.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.391
-Do I have $1,200?
-$1,200.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.960
$1,200 to Matt. Do I have $1,500?

09:21.027 --> 09:22.328
-$1,500?
-$1,500.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.530
Do I have $1,800?

09:24.597 --> 09:25.665
It's all Seth's.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.833
Sold! Seth, you don't know what you got.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.068
I don't. Let's see it.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.270
A tapenade.

09:31.337 --> 09:34.240
Tapenade? Jordan, tapenade?

09:35.975 --> 09:37.643
Olives, bro. Thanks.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.812
-Jordan, I'm never trusting you again.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.914
I love tapenade,
but it's not gonna help me here.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.050
-Seth, you can have it.
-Tapenade.

09:47.286 --> 09:50.456
Home cooks, the next item up for bid,

09:50.523 --> 09:53.559
I believe, is something
you're really going to want.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.895
-Lemons.
-Oh!

09:55.962 --> 09:57.697
Interesting, 'cause you all have fish.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.699
So, a perfect little hit of acid.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.702
I don't care how much the lemons are.
I need the lemons.

10:02.768 --> 10:03.903
I'm gonna buy the lemons.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.305
-Opening bid's $1,000. Danica.

10:06.372 --> 10:07.740
-$1,000.
-One thousand.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.709
-Do I have $1,500?

10:09.775 --> 10:11.344
-You have $1,500.
-$1,500 from Matt.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.512
-Do I have $2,000?
-Two thousand, two thousand.

10:13.579 --> 10:15.915
$2,000 is going to Danica
for three lemons.

10:15.982 --> 10:18.884
I play competitive dodgeball.
I like to get all the boys out,

10:18.951 --> 10:22.488
and I'm really good,
so sorry, Matt, these lemons are mine.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.925
-Sold. Three lemons for $2,000.
-Thank you.

10:25.992 --> 10:28.227
Those better be some good lemons.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.430
Lemon juice on my crudo,
it will make all the difference.

10:31.497 --> 10:33.399
Most expensive lemons
in the history of the world.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.800
-Right.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.402
Stop making fun of me and my lemons!

10:37.336 --> 10:39.739
The last item up for auction is…

10:42.742 --> 10:44.310
…three salmon fillets.

10:44.377 --> 10:47.446
-Praising the salmon gods right now.

10:47.513 --> 10:49.715
-The opening bid is $1,500.

10:49.782 --> 10:53.285
-$1,500.
-$1,500 going to Matt. $1,500 going twice.

10:53.352 --> 10:54.787
Sold to Matt.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.355
This skate can skate off.

10:56.422 --> 10:59.492
There you go.
Grab your salmon. Great job.

10:59.558 --> 11:02.028
Skate wing, I'm sure
it's a beautiful protein.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.462
It's not showing up on my plate.

11:06.365 --> 11:09.669
Danica, your dish is a total of $7,000.

11:09.735 --> 11:10.736
-So…

11:10.803 --> 11:13.673
I hope this-- this food is tasty!

11:13.739 --> 11:15.675
Me too. Me too.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.977
So with the Spend Box,
there's a lot more pressure.

11:18.044 --> 11:22.348
You're expected to make excellence
with these excellent ingredients.

11:22.982 --> 11:26.952
I've got Fresno chilies,
mangoes, and shallots.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.088
Figured I'd make a salsa with them.

11:29.155 --> 11:32.024
Mix it all together, add some lemon,
season. That's my salsa.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.994
Seth and Matt should be scared.
I'm going to beat 'em.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.595
Mm, that's spicy.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.133
Sear, sear, sear.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.236
I'm looking at this tapenade
like a tape-nah.

11:44.303 --> 11:48.941
But I remember I have pickled asparagus,
that has some briney flavor,

11:49.008 --> 11:52.078
the tapenade has some briney flavor,
so I'm doing a pickle relish.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.647
See how it complements my fish.

11:55.981 --> 11:56.849
I can make this work.

11:57.516 --> 11:58.984
It's actually really good.

12:01.487 --> 12:04.590
My plan with the salmon is
to take some more hash browns…

12:04.657 --> 12:05.658
There we go.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.329
…turn them into a breading,
and pan fry the salmon.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.799
Rick gets that one. The nice one.

12:16.435 --> 12:18.270
-Five minutes left, home cooks.
-Shoot.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.273
Ticktock. Let's go.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.114
Mmm, that's actually really good.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.349
Danica, I sure wish
I had some of your lemon.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.485
Oh, yeah? Snooze, you lose, buddy.

12:32.551 --> 12:34.520
I'm looking at my dish,

12:34.587 --> 12:36.522
and I'm like, "What more could I have done

12:36.589 --> 12:38.891
with this mushroom soup
and the ingredients?"

12:38.958 --> 12:41.494
Again, did I mention that I hate this box?

12:43.462 --> 12:45.865
One minute left. Home cooks, one minute.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.200
I spent
a lot of money on this dish,

12:48.267 --> 12:51.537
and I'm hoping it's worth it
because I want to win.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.374
I always want to be the best of the best,
so winning is super important.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.509
Oh, that's a lot of lemon.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.711
Home cooks,
you have ten seconds. Let's go!

12:58.778 --> 13:00.946
Get those plates on the line.

13:01.013 --> 13:02.715
-Seven, six…

13:03.716 --> 13:05.885
-…five, four…

13:05.951 --> 13:09.555
-Got it!
-…three, two, one.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.024
-Time's up.

13:12.091 --> 13:14.126
Good job, home cooks. Good job.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.861
This is hard.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.732
It's time to send those plates
down the line for Chef Martinez.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.569
Knowing that Chef Martinez
is about to taste my food

13:23.636 --> 13:25.337
definitely adds to the nerves.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.873
Rick is an icon, he's incredible.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.844
-What up, Chef?
-I'm ready. I'm hungry.

13:33.078 --> 13:36.215
So first up, we have
a hash brown-crusted salmon

13:36.282 --> 13:37.550
on a vegetable hash.

13:38.517 --> 13:39.552
Ooh.

13:39.618 --> 13:41.587
I'm very curious about this.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.589
Very well done.

13:48.928 --> 13:49.795
Mmm.

13:49.862 --> 13:53.165
I think this is probably
a little bit over.

13:53.232 --> 13:56.235
It's pretty dry. I will say,
though, that the-- the crust

13:56.302 --> 13:57.736
is actually really pleasant.

13:57.803 --> 14:00.973
The home cook gave me
a crispy exterior with the hash browns.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.741
-So points for that.
-Okay.

14:02.808 --> 14:06.478
I really like the seasoning in the medley.
I can taste the asparagus.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.948
I think what I really need is a sauce.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.717
I think if there had been
some kind of a bright sauce,

14:11.784 --> 14:14.653
I wouldn't have noticed as much
the overcooking of the fish.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.756
Yeah, one of the surprise cloches
you sent out was lemon.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.525
-Right.
-They bid on the lemon.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.526
But they didn't get it.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.194
The hash browns, kind of heavy.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.063
It needs some acid
to like to cut through it,

14:24.129 --> 14:25.397
so that would have helped.

14:26.732 --> 14:28.734
All right, so next up…

14:29.735 --> 14:31.804
we have a cream of mushroom tilapia

14:31.871 --> 14:34.506
with a Japanese mayo mashed potatoes.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.375
I like this presentation.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.978
I'm seeing different colors,
different textures,

14:39.044 --> 14:40.279
lots of different ingredients.

14:40.346 --> 14:41.413
-All good things.
-Yeah.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.555
Mmm. I like the mashed potatoes.

14:50.589 --> 14:53.325
Very umami. That's really good.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.462
The cook on the, uh, tilapia is nice.

14:56.528 --> 14:57.796
It's still juicy.

14:57.863 --> 15:00.099
In terms of the sauce, I wish

15:00.165 --> 15:02.902
that there had been
a little bit more transformation.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.571
I'm aware that there's
a can of soup as a sauce.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.540
The asparagus and the tapenade,
I think if some of those flavors

15:08.607 --> 15:11.377
had been incorporated into the sauce,
maybe thinned it a little bit,

15:11.443 --> 15:14.213
maybe used a little bit of the brine,
I think that might have helped.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.181
-Mm-hmm.
-But I think it's a very successful dish.

15:18.183 --> 15:19.952
-Last but not least.
-All right.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.221
So, this right here, tuna crudo,

15:22.288 --> 15:24.356
mango salsa, and crispy shiitake.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.125
I like this presentation.

15:27.693 --> 15:32.097
Something to keep in mind, this home cook
purchased the lemons for $2,000.

15:32.164 --> 15:33.265
Wow.

15:33.332 --> 15:36.068
Well, the cook is definitely
getting their money's worth

15:36.135 --> 15:38.337
'cause that zest lifts it up.

15:38.404 --> 15:42.741
This was a very sophisticated dish
with a lot of layered flavors.

15:42.808 --> 15:45.411
You've got so much brightness
from the lemon.

15:45.477 --> 15:48.180
You have a little pop
of sweetness from the mango.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.349
You have really nice heat from the Fresno.

15:50.416 --> 15:54.086
This person really respected this protein,
which I'm very happy about.

15:54.153 --> 15:58.023
I would have wanted
the shiitake to be a little bit smaller.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.025
They're too big for the bite.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.294
But I think
this was a very successful dish.

16:03.862 --> 16:06.432
-So, Chef, have you come to a decision?
-I have.

16:12.371 --> 16:13.973
Let's go.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.608
-Whoo!
-All right, cooks. It's judgment day.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.811
Danica, Seth, Matt,

16:18.877 --> 16:22.281
the home cook
with the best out-of-the-box dish is…

16:26.752 --> 16:28.821
-Danica.

16:28.887 --> 16:30.255
-Yay!

16:30.322 --> 16:32.057
Oh, awesome.

16:32.124 --> 16:35.094
It was the most expensive tuna crudo
I've ever had,

16:35.160 --> 16:36.996
but it was completely worth it.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.865
The final challenge
is called Chef's Choice

16:39.932 --> 16:43.002
and we'll be celebrating
Chef Martinez's culinary passion

16:43.068 --> 16:45.137
with a taste of Mexico.

16:45.204 --> 16:46.038
All right.

16:46.538 --> 16:49.375
Chef Martinez
is preparing ingredient boxes

16:49.441 --> 16:52.144
to help you make
your best Mexican-inspired dish.

16:52.211 --> 16:55.848
I was born and raised in LA,
so Mexican food is second nature to me.

16:55.914 --> 16:58.550
I am as ready as ready can be.

16:58.617 --> 17:00.953
Okay, Chef Martinez,
whenever you're ready.

17:07.626 --> 17:10.129
In this round,
the boxes have set prices.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.868
The Spend Box is going to cost you $8,000.

17:16.468 --> 17:19.438
The Save Box is priced at $4,000.

17:19.505 --> 17:22.241
And the Surprise Box will run you $6,000.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.010
Danica, since you've won
the first challenge,

17:25.077 --> 17:29.481
you've earned the power to assign
each box to whichever cook you like.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.949
-Oh, come on.

17:31.016 --> 17:32.217
Whoo-hoo!

17:32.284 --> 17:33.986
-Wow.
-I like that.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.422
Danica, we're friends.
We're-- We're good friends.

17:36.488 --> 17:39.591
Where am I in this equation?
We've been bonding.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.727
Danica, which box would you like to buy?

17:42.594 --> 17:44.763
-I'd like the Spend, Jordan.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.332
-The Spend Box.
-Yeah. Playing to win.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.400
Eight big ones.

17:49.268 --> 17:54.339
I'd rather spend all my money and win
than save it and lose.

17:55.174 --> 17:57.609
How would you like
to assign the other two boxes?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.115
The Save is going to go to my buddy Seth.

18:03.182 --> 18:05.250
Oh, wow! All right.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.419
I want some more dynamic ingredients.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.721
I got cream of mushroom
and tilapia last time.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.623
You'll have
a dynamic bank account when you win.

18:11.690 --> 18:14.493
I like that "when." <i>When</i> I win. Let's go.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.329
Seth, you were gifted
the Save Box for $4,000.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.898
And finally, Matt,

18:19.965 --> 18:21.300
you got the Surprise Box

18:21.366 --> 18:23.669
at a cost of $6,000.

18:23.735 --> 18:24.670
I can take it.

18:24.736 --> 18:27.406
I don't think I can be more surprised
than getting a skate wing,

18:27.473 --> 18:29.141
so it's all uphill from here.

18:30.676 --> 18:33.745
The home cook
with the best Mexican-inspired dish

18:33.812 --> 18:36.482
will win whatever cash you
have left in your bank.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.251
You have 60 minutes on the clock,

18:39.852 --> 18:41.987
and the time has come again to…

18:42.621 --> 18:43.956
cook at all costs!

18:51.864 --> 18:56.635
Not even looking yet.
Let's find out. Okay, instant cornbread.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.670
I open the Surprise Box,

18:58.737 --> 19:02.541
and I've got poblano peppers,
jicama, and canned pork.

19:04.009 --> 19:06.778
More ingredients
that I don't know how to cook.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.380
I have to find out what this is.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.149
Oh, it's like that.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.518
I was thinking more like pulled pork.

19:13.619 --> 19:18.056
At this moment, I'm without a road map.
It's all question marks in front of me.

19:18.123 --> 19:22.528
What am I going to do?
Okay, so I really don't know.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.265
Masa, yes!

19:26.331 --> 19:28.567
Oh, these beans.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.837
Chipotle peppers, pork tenderloin.

19:31.904 --> 19:36.175
I see this pork loin,
and my eyes light up. I'm happy.

19:36.241 --> 19:39.311
It's a product I'm very familiar with,
cooked it plenty of times.

19:39.378 --> 19:43.015
I also have masa
and I know how to make my own tortillas,

19:43.081 --> 19:45.617
so I'm making pork tacos.

19:47.052 --> 19:53.392
Okay, we got brown rice,
refried beans, jalapeños, ground pork.

19:53.458 --> 19:57.863
I'm not liking having the Save Box again.
I want some premium ingredients.

19:57.930 --> 20:02.134
There's not a lot of sexy things
you can do with ground pork.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.102
I don't necessarily have a plan yet.

20:04.670 --> 20:07.005
Round two! And the proteins are revealed.

20:07.072 --> 20:11.076
We have some ground pork in the Save Box,
pork tenderloin in the Spend Box,

20:11.143 --> 20:13.278
and canned pork in the Surprise Box.

20:13.345 --> 20:14.413
Good luck.

20:15.447 --> 20:16.982
Hmm, we're just going right in.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.551
Right now, I'm thinking enchiladas.

20:19.618 --> 20:23.855
I'm going to use the shredded pork
in my filling, but I need tortillas.

20:23.922 --> 20:26.425
This is an experiment.

20:26.491 --> 20:29.161
I'm trying to make tortillas
out of this cornbread mix,

20:29.228 --> 20:32.598
and every time I press it, it splits
between the two pieces of parchment.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.834
And if I don't have tortillas,
I can't make enchiladas.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.570
This is not working,
so we're done with that.

20:40.539 --> 20:43.775
I'm going with the strategy
of just making what I know first.

20:43.842 --> 20:48.614
So, I'm making flour tortillas,
and I'm sautéing that ground pork off,

20:48.680 --> 20:53.252
but I don't have any flavors in my box
that are inherently Mexican.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.287
I really, really need some seasonings.

20:55.854 --> 21:00.392
Home cooks,
the line is moving, red light flashing.

21:01.226 --> 21:04.062
You know what that means.
Time to spend some money.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.134
Yeah, I'm ready to place some bids.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.270
I've got the most money
in my account

21:11.336 --> 21:14.339
so now it's time for me to strategize
and spend some myself.

21:14.406 --> 21:15.707
For the first item…

21:18.010 --> 21:19.244
…garlic and onions.

21:19.311 --> 21:22.914
We are offering these essentials
to any cook who wants to buy in

21:22.981 --> 21:26.218
at the very reasonable price of $1,000.

21:26.285 --> 21:31.023
Onions and garlic, that is like a staple
in Mexican cuisine. Need it.

21:31.089 --> 21:32.257
All three of you can have it.

21:32.324 --> 21:33.392
-I'm in.

21:35.894 --> 21:38.030
Come grab it. One onion, one garlic.

21:38.096 --> 21:40.098
There you go.
One and one, and then one and one.

21:40.832 --> 21:42.968
That will cost you each $1,000.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.102
I love this show.

21:45.270 --> 21:48.273
The next item up for auction is…

21:48.340 --> 21:51.109
Oh, wow. Tortillas.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.211
Tortillas!

21:53.278 --> 21:54.713
This is salmon round two.

21:54.780 --> 21:58.383
This is exactly what I need
after my cornbread massacre.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.352
I'm pushing all the chips in for these.

22:00.952 --> 22:02.888
I'll start it at $1,000.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.424
$1,000. All right.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.292
-Do I have $1,200?

22:07.359 --> 22:09.695
$1,200, even though she has masa harina.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.396
-$1,400.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.832
-$1,600. Do I have 18?

22:13.899 --> 22:16.868
-$1,800. $2,000?

22:16.935 --> 22:18.704
-Danica!

22:18.770 --> 22:21.006
Kind of messing
with Matt a little bit here.

22:21.073 --> 22:24.876
Planning on making my own tortillas.
I have masa. I know what to do.

22:24.943 --> 22:26.311
Matt, that's 25.

22:26.378 --> 22:27.612
-I'll take 25.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.914
-28. Danica?

22:28.980 --> 22:30.649
-$3,200?

22:30.716 --> 22:32.951
$3,200!

22:33.018 --> 22:34.920
Do I have 3,500?

22:34.986 --> 22:36.421
3,200 going once,

22:36.488 --> 22:38.824
-3,200 going twice.
-You don't, you don't.

22:38.890 --> 22:42.928
-Sold! The most expensive tortillas ever!
-Oh!

22:42.994 --> 22:44.262
Matt, go ahead.

22:44.329 --> 22:47.299
These tortillas are worth
every single penny.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.935
My instant cornbread
was not gonna make the grade.

22:50.001 --> 22:51.470
Now I can make enchiladas.

22:51.536 --> 22:55.807
The next item up for bid
is taco seasonings.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.977
We have cumin, paprika,
cayenne, and chili powder.

22:59.044 --> 23:03.348
These four spices are the foundation
for so many great Mexican dishes.

23:03.982 --> 23:07.452
This is the one thing I need
to, like, really save my dish.

23:07.519 --> 23:10.122
I don't have any inherent Mexican flavors.

23:10.188 --> 23:11.323
I need these flavors.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.091
And I'll start the bidding at $1,200.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.127
-$1,200 going to Seth.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.828
Do I have $1,500?

23:16.895 --> 23:19.364
$1,200 going once, going twice.

23:19.431 --> 23:20.432
Sold to Seth.

23:20.499 --> 23:21.900
Thank you both.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.803
$1,200 for taco seasoning? Sold.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.239
Last item up for auction is…

23:28.173 --> 23:30.876
Wow! A guacamole kit.

23:30.942 --> 23:34.579
This has avocados,
lime, and fresh cilantro.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.248
Oh!

23:36.314 --> 23:38.483
Love cilantro on top of my tacos.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.619
I hear the words guac kit,

23:40.685 --> 23:43.655
I need it to add, like,
some more texture to my dish.

23:43.722 --> 23:45.957
I will stop at nothing.

23:46.024 --> 23:47.592
You hear me? Nothing.

23:47.659 --> 23:49.361
Opening bid, $1,500.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.963
-Do I have $1,800?

23:53.198 --> 23:54.399
-$2,200?

23:54.466 --> 23:56.301
-$2,500?

23:56.368 --> 23:58.336
-Do I have $2,800?

23:58.403 --> 24:00.205
-$2,800 going to Seth.

24:01.006 --> 24:03.074
We got a full-on guac-off going.

24:07.312 --> 24:08.413
Do I have $3,200?

24:08.480 --> 24:11.149
-$3,200 going to Danica.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.251
Do I have $3,500?

24:13.318 --> 24:14.686
-We're going to four.

24:14.753 --> 24:16.421
-$4,500.

24:16.488 --> 24:19.057
-$5,000, Danica.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.592
-My goodness!

24:20.659 --> 24:23.028
$5,500 going once, going twice.

24:23.094 --> 24:25.263
Sold! To Seth.

24:26.765 --> 24:28.066
Oh, man.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.302
This lime costs $1,000.

24:30.802 --> 24:34.506
I just paid $5,500 for a guacamole kit.

24:34.573 --> 24:38.376
Guac is gonna add some dynamics
to this dish that I really need.

24:38.443 --> 24:41.213
I mean, the old saying is true.
You gotta spend money to make money.

24:43.114 --> 24:45.884
I season my pork
with this taco seasoning

24:45.951 --> 24:49.054
and the aroma, the flavor,
everything changed.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.188
Smells right.

24:50.255 --> 24:53.625
And I take this Save Box to a suave box.

24:53.692 --> 24:56.828
-Danica, how you looking over there?
-So far, so good.

24:56.895 --> 24:57.863
What are you making?

24:57.929 --> 24:58.964
None of your beeswax.

24:59.030 --> 25:00.899
-How about--
-Hey!

25:00.966 --> 25:06.238
So, I'm making pork and yam tacos
with Spanish rice, garlic refried beans,

25:06.304 --> 25:07.873
and spicy guacamole.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.574
Now I have a dish.

25:10.308 --> 25:11.343
This is perfect.

25:12.143 --> 25:13.111
Mmm.

25:13.845 --> 25:14.746
Danica.

25:15.580 --> 25:16.681
What's up?

25:16.748 --> 25:17.816
These taste so sweet.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.184
-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm!

25:19.251 --> 25:20.485
You should enjoy 'em.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.454
-Mmm! Worth every penny.
-They were a gift.

25:24.456 --> 25:27.158
The shredded pork filling
is cooking with onions,

25:27.225 --> 25:30.862
and the tortillas are the cornerstone
that's bringing these enchiladas together.

25:30.929 --> 25:33.999
And I finally figured out
what I'm going to use this jicama for,

25:34.065 --> 25:35.967
and I'm going to make some jicama fries.

25:36.034 --> 25:39.104
I think this is a huge risk
because you don't normally see fries

25:39.170 --> 25:40.438
served with enchiladas.

25:40.505 --> 25:43.041
Eh, could have enchiladas
and fries.

25:44.009 --> 25:45.076
Why not?

25:46.511 --> 25:47.979
-What's up, Chef?
-Jordan.

25:48.747 --> 25:51.516
-You sent some tortillas out for auction.
-Yes.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.985
What do you hope
the home cooks do with that?

25:54.052 --> 25:56.388
Like, give me like a nice hard toast.

25:56.454 --> 25:58.089
Anybody can just warm it up.

25:58.156 --> 25:59.190
Can you transform it?

25:59.257 --> 26:01.927
Uh, so there are lots of different things
that you can do with it

26:01.993 --> 26:04.963
beyond just, like, heating it up
and just making a taco.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.198
Also, I'm really excited

26:07.265 --> 26:10.702
because everybody's got
a version of the jalapeño.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.737
So, either chipotle in adobo,

26:12.804 --> 26:13.838
dried chipotle,

26:13.905 --> 26:15.073
or fresh jalapeños.

26:15.140 --> 26:18.944
I want you to tell them,
they need to make it super spicy for me.

26:19.010 --> 26:21.713
Yes. I'mma go check on the home cooks.
I'll catch you later.

26:21.780 --> 26:22.647
Cool.

26:30.322 --> 26:33.525
Home cooks, I have
a little message from Chef Martinez.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.027
-Lay it on us.
-He likes things spicy.

26:36.094 --> 26:36.928
All right.

26:36.995 --> 26:40.398
Bring the capsaicin.
Bring the heat. Bring the fire!

26:40.465 --> 26:43.134
Can't relate, but going
to make it happen.

26:43.201 --> 26:45.737
Mexican is really not something
I'm used to cooking.

26:45.804 --> 26:49.040
If I come within a quarter-mile of spice,
I start getting a sunburn.

26:49.107 --> 26:52.210
I should try what one of these taste like
before I throw a million in there.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.849
It's-- It's really spicy. 

26:57.916 --> 26:59.317
What you doing over there, Matt?

26:59.884 --> 27:02.787
Right now, I'm blending
my thousand-dollar garlic and onion,

27:02.854 --> 27:05.357
roasted poblanos, roasted tomatillos,

27:05.423 --> 27:08.827
smoky dried jalapeños
that have been soaking,

27:08.893 --> 27:10.695
and I'm making a salsa verde out of it.

27:10.762 --> 27:13.164
-Good enough for me.

27:14.399 --> 27:17.035
He likes it spicy, I'mma make it spicy.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.838
Every good taco needs a salsa.

27:19.904 --> 27:24.109
I'm roasting the red peppers and tomatoes
with the chipotle and onion.

27:24.175 --> 27:27.545
I'm trying to make this salsa extra spicy.

27:32.684 --> 27:34.252
So, I've got my guacamole.

27:34.319 --> 27:37.188
I add some additional jalapeños.

27:37.255 --> 27:40.825
Oh, this is the worst plating
that I've done in years,

27:40.892 --> 27:43.294
Chef Rick might not
like my plating at all,

27:43.361 --> 27:46.264
but once he tastes that $5,500 guacamole,

27:46.831 --> 27:48.767
I think appearances won't matter too much.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.469
Home cooks,<i> sesenta segundos.</i>

27:51.536 --> 27:53.171
That's "60 seconds" in Spanish.

27:53.238 --> 27:54.239
Yikes.

27:54.806 --> 27:57.742
Remember you need
to place your plates on the line,

27:57.809 --> 28:00.812
then hit your buzzer before time runs out.

28:00.879 --> 28:01.880
This is not good.

28:01.946 --> 28:04.516
I don't think the dish
is gonna be hot enough for Chef Rick.

28:04.582 --> 28:09.454
I don't know if there is enough chipotle,
but I'm hoping I get that W.

28:10.789 --> 28:13.425
I'm really excited
for Chef Martinez to taste my dish.

28:13.491 --> 28:16.861
I think I really packed
a lot of heat and a lot of flavor into it.

28:16.928 --> 28:17.996
And I hope he loves it.

28:18.063 --> 28:18.963
Ten…

28:19.030 --> 28:19.998
I'm almost there.

28:20.065 --> 28:24.202
…nine, eight, seven, six…

28:24.769 --> 28:25.904
-…five…

28:25.970 --> 28:27.072
-…four…

28:27.906 --> 28:30.675
-Got it!
-…three, two…

28:30.742 --> 28:31.976
-one.

28:33.178 --> 28:34.679
-There we go!
-You did it. Yay!

28:37.282 --> 28:40.518
Time's up. We're going to send
these plates back to Chef Martinez.

28:43.188 --> 28:45.790
I am feeling nervous.

28:45.857 --> 28:48.126
I want to win so bad.

28:48.193 --> 28:51.296
So, it's all in God
and Chef Rick's hands now at this point.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.265
All right, Chef.

28:54.833 --> 28:57.235
Are you ready for a taste of Mexico?

28:57.302 --> 28:58.703
-Bring it.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.839
-This looks so good, doesn't it?
-It looks so good.

29:00.905 --> 29:03.274
I'm so impressed
with the plating of all three.

29:03.341 --> 29:06.511
First up,
you have a shredded pork enchilada

29:06.578 --> 29:10.882
with jicama fries and a poblano
and roasted tomatillo salsa verde.

29:10.949 --> 29:14.319
I'm slightly nervous
about the canned pork.

29:14.385 --> 29:16.287
We'll see how it was transformed.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.861
It's a really flavorful filling.

29:22.927 --> 29:25.563
I'm not aware that I'm eating
a canned pork product.

29:25.630 --> 29:30.201
The star of this dish
is definitely this person's salsa.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.704
-This is a flavor bomb with a lot of heat.
-Wow!

29:32.771 --> 29:34.606
But I'd probably want
something a little creamy.

29:34.672 --> 29:36.808
You've got something
really intensely spicy.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.643
-It kind of counteracts that.
-Tempers it.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.745
I am super excited
about this jicama.

29:40.812 --> 29:43.481
It's like crispy but still tender.

29:43.548 --> 29:45.049
It's so good.

29:47.051 --> 29:48.086
All right, Chef.

29:48.153 --> 29:53.158
Next up is a pork and yam taco
on a homemade tortilla,

29:53.224 --> 29:57.128
with Spanish rice, garlic refried beans,
and spicy guacamole.

30:00.498 --> 30:03.802
The instant brown rice,
it's just a little dry.

30:04.402 --> 30:06.638
But the guacamole helps a lot.

30:07.172 --> 30:09.641
-So the guac kit that you put out there--
-Mm-hmm.

30:09.707 --> 30:12.911
…went for $5,500.

30:12.977 --> 30:16.514
I really like it.
It's got like a really nice level of acid.

30:16.581 --> 30:20.485
I'm glad that they also included
these sliced jalapeños, for my added kick.

30:20.552 --> 30:25.056
So, the same cook also purchased
taco seasoning for $1,200.

30:25.123 --> 30:26.624
I think this was a good purchase.

30:26.691 --> 30:29.394
Ground pork particularly can be very dry.

30:29.460 --> 30:32.130
Usually it's a leaner cut of pork
that they grind up.

30:32.197 --> 30:35.166
There's not a lot of fat, which of course
means there's not a lot of flavor.

30:35.233 --> 30:38.970
So those spices
really pull out a lot of flavor.

30:39.037 --> 30:40.538
I think this is a very successful dish.

30:42.073 --> 30:48.279
This dish consists of pork tacos
with a tomato and red pepper salsa,

30:48.346 --> 30:50.682
and fried black beans,
and a little bit of queso.

30:50.748 --> 30:53.017
This looks
like a restaurant presentation to me.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.421
We're gonna do this the way that we do it.
Never tilt the taco.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.223
-Always tilt your head.
-Yep.

31:00.825 --> 31:01.793
Mmm.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.228
That is a very good taco.

31:03.294 --> 31:06.097
These tortillas are handmade,
they taste delicious.

31:06.164 --> 31:08.700
You know, one of the concerns
that I had with the tenderloin

31:08.766 --> 31:11.035
is if you overcook it, it's like leather.

31:11.102 --> 31:13.104
-Yeah.
-If you under-season it, it's--

31:13.171 --> 31:14.272
-So bland. Yeah.
-…boring.

31:14.339 --> 31:17.442
But this is seasoned well,
it's still juicy,

31:17.508 --> 31:19.510
it's got some really nice flavor.

31:19.577 --> 31:22.347
That's actually a really nice salsa
and it's sweet.

31:22.413 --> 31:25.216
-How's the spice level?
-The heat is there.

31:25.283 --> 31:27.018
Not my level there, but…

31:28.753 --> 31:31.789
Chef, it may be a tough decision,
but do you think you have your winner?

31:32.357 --> 31:35.526
They all brought their A-game,
but I think I've made my decision.

31:39.631 --> 31:40.932
This is it.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.969
It's time to find out
who won the competition

31:45.036 --> 31:47.739
and all that cash in their bank.

31:48.406 --> 31:51.309
But first, I'd like to introduce you

31:51.376 --> 31:55.446
to our guest judge and the chef
behind all of those amazing ingredients.

31:55.513 --> 31:58.049
The one, the only, Chef Rick Martinez.

32:00.151 --> 32:01.319
Rick!

32:01.386 --> 32:02.287
-Hey.
-Hey!

32:02.353 --> 32:03.988
Hello.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.123
So cool.

32:05.723 --> 32:07.492
Let's get to the results.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.496
So, I want to start by saying

32:11.562 --> 32:14.599
all three of these dishes were incredible.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.235
Which of you made
the shredded pork enchilada?

32:17.302 --> 32:18.569
That would be me, Chef.

32:18.636 --> 32:21.205
Your enchilada
was perfectly executed

32:21.272 --> 32:24.375
and I really enjoyed your jicama fries.
Well done, Matt.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.646
Who made the pork and yam tacos?

32:28.713 --> 32:29.881
I did, Chef.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.383
Seth, you brought great flavor
to ground pork,

32:32.450 --> 32:34.452
which is not an easy accomplishment.

32:34.519 --> 32:36.454
It was incredibly delicious.

32:36.521 --> 32:37.989
Thank you so much, Chef.

32:38.056 --> 32:38.923
So, Danica…

32:39.590 --> 32:41.960
that leaves you with those pork tacos.

32:42.026 --> 32:42.860
Yup.

32:42.927 --> 32:45.430
Your dish looked
like it came right out of a restaurant.

32:45.496 --> 32:49.667
Every component was delicious,
and I was really impressed by the salsa.

32:50.168 --> 32:53.037
Home cooks, it's now time
to find out who will be going home

32:53.104 --> 32:55.039
with all the money left in their bank.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.643
Danica, you have $9,000 remaining.

32:59.744 --> 33:03.014
Seth, you have $9,100.

33:03.614 --> 33:08.419
And Matt, you have
the largest amount with $9,499.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.154
The cook with the winning dish

33:10.221 --> 33:13.791
who proved that they could
cook at all costs is…

33:18.363 --> 33:20.298
-Danica!
-Oh my God!

33:21.532 --> 33:23.368
Oh my God! Thanks!

33:23.434 --> 33:25.069
Whoo!

33:25.136 --> 33:26.938
Oh my God. Yay!

33:27.005 --> 33:30.908
Congratulations, Danica.
All of the cash in your bank is yours.

33:30.975 --> 33:32.977
Whoo-hoo! Yay!

33:33.044 --> 33:35.413
I did not care
about the money at all.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.481
I just wanted to win

33:36.547 --> 33:39.984
and now I have the added bonus of $9,000.

33:40.051 --> 33:41.619
That's not just pocket money.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.989
Congratulations, Danica, you've proven
that you can cook at all costs.

33:45.056 --> 33:46.991
-Whoo!

33:47.058 --> 33:49.394
Hearing Chef Martinez say
those things about my dish

33:49.460 --> 33:51.229
showed me that I made it work,

33:51.295 --> 33:53.464
and anyone can make cooking work for them.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.900
Whether that's about budget
or culture or flavor,

33:55.967 --> 33:58.302
all it takes is effort and time.

33:58.369 --> 34:02.707
I am beyond excited that I pushed myself
to do this competition.

34:03.274 --> 34:05.810
And I've arrived. I'm on Netflix now.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.379
Like, y'all can't
tell me nothing.

34:08.446 --> 34:12.383
I think I learned today
I am a really good cook. I can do this.
