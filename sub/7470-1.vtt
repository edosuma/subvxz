02:44.770 --> 02:47.690
- Bull's-eye!
- You bet, Dad!

03:09.837 --> 03:11.130
You go straight home.

03:11.380 --> 03:12.256
Okay!

03:17.302 --> 03:19.013
Bombs away!

03:29.690 --> 03:32.025
Sayonara, sucker!

05:37.733 --> 05:40.903
No preservatives, just pure water!

05:41.195 --> 05:43.531
Cool, clear water.

05:43.823 --> 05:46.283
Step up, schmuck, get some dealing done.

05:46.534 --> 05:48.536
H20, that's my go.

05:48.911 --> 05:52.873
Don't you understand? This is water.
You can't live without it.

05:57.044 --> 06:01.132
What's a little fallout, huh?
Have a nice day!

06:18.983 --> 06:20.484
You get a sack of grain...

06:20.901 --> 06:23.237
...or a woman for two hours.

06:31.036 --> 06:33.163
What are you trading?
- I'm looking for someone.

06:33.413 --> 06:34.790
Are you trading or not?

06:35.040 --> 06:36.250
He had a team of camels.

06:36.750 --> 06:41.421
People come here to trade,
make a little profit, do some business.

06:42.464 --> 06:45.050
If you've nothing to trade,
you've no business here.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.343
An hour inside.

06:47.010 --> 06:49.721
- Next!
- I got skills I can trade.

06:50.597 --> 06:52.474
Sorry. The brothel's full.

07:11.034 --> 07:12.369
One hour.

07:12.619 --> 07:15.664
- And if you find him?
- I'll ask him to return what's mine.

07:15.956 --> 07:18.625
And he'll be desperate
to clear his conscience.

07:18.875 --> 07:19.918
He will be.

07:20.460 --> 07:22.128
You're that good?

07:24.631 --> 07:27.467
Perhaps you have something to trade
after all.

07:27.801 --> 07:29.010
Keep talking.

07:29.636 --> 07:31.805
24 hours of your life.

07:32.347 --> 07:34.975
In return,
you'll get back what was stolen.

07:35.642 --> 07:37.143
Sounds like a bargain.

07:37.519 --> 07:41.606
It's not. Let's talk.
Come inside.

07:55.870 --> 07:58.373
Leave your weapons here.
It's the law.

09:31.590 --> 09:36.095
Remember, this is the
vehicle that sent Detroit broke.

09:37.763 --> 09:39.598
Where did you get these animals?

09:39.848 --> 09:42.768
The glorious dromedary.
The ship of the desert.

09:43.101 --> 09:47.981
They've got independent suspension,
power steering and no emission control.

09:48.273 --> 09:49.566
Ride them away now.

11:09.854 --> 11:11.147
A warrior, Aunty.

11:12.023 --> 11:15.026
Lost everything.
Looking for a deal.

11:19.364 --> 11:21.532
But he's just a raggedy man.

11:22.575 --> 11:23.910
He's quick.

11:24.619 --> 11:25.495
Ironbar...

11:25.995 --> 11:27.455
...can he do it?

11:28.706 --> 11:29.624
Maybe.

11:36.881 --> 11:38.549
What did you do before this?

11:38.883 --> 11:41.052
I was a cop, a driver.

11:44.055 --> 11:45.973
But how the world turns.

11:46.223 --> 11:48.893
One day cock of the walk,
next, a feather duster.

11:49.226 --> 11:51.979
Play something tragic, Ton Ton.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.986
Do you know who I was?

11:59.737 --> 12:00.905
Nobody.

12:01.572 --> 12:04.909
Except on the day after,
I was still alive.

12:05.910 --> 12:08.454
This nobody had a chance to be somebody.

12:10.247 --> 12:14.251
So much for history. Anyway...
Water? Fruit?

13:04.134 --> 13:07.137
Congratulations. You're the first
to survive the audition.

13:14.811 --> 13:15.979
Drink.

13:17.355 --> 13:18.565
It's okay.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.578
Come with me.

13:35.457 --> 13:38.209
Look around. All this I built.

13:39.753 --> 13:42.339
Up to my armpits in blood and shit.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.759
Where there was desert,
now there's a town.

13:46.718 --> 13:48.720
Where there was robbery,
there's trade.

13:49.512 --> 13:52.348
Where there was despair,
now there's hope.

13:52.891 --> 13:54.350
It's civilization.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.353
I'll do anything to protect it.

14:00.148 --> 14:03.568
Today it's necessary to kill a man.
What do you say?

14:05.737 --> 14:06.905
What do you pay?

14:07.864 --> 14:12.368
I'll re-equip you...
Vehicles, animals. Fuel, if you want.

14:12.660 --> 14:14.037
It's a generous offer.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.540
Why me? You've got warriors,
weapons. Give the order.

14:18.082 --> 14:20.627
We are dealing with subtleties here.

14:21.044 --> 14:23.379
This is no enemy.
It's almost family.

14:24.047 --> 14:25.882
I see, real civilized.

14:26.466 --> 14:30.261
The reasons don't concern you,
just the conditions. Deal?

14:32.722 --> 14:35.725
First, no one knows
you're working for Aunty.

14:36.058 --> 14:38.227
You hit him, you go.

14:38.603 --> 14:40.938
Second, it's a fair fight.

14:41.230 --> 14:43.566
And third, it's to the death.

14:46.736 --> 14:48.112
Who's the bunny?

15:24.064 --> 15:27.735
It's called Underworld.
It's where Bartertown gets its energy.

15:28.277 --> 15:29.653
Oil, natural gas?

15:30.112 --> 15:31.447
Pigs.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.699
Pigs like those?

15:35.034 --> 15:37.286
- Bullshit.
- Pigshit.

15:37.786 --> 15:41.665
Pigshit. The lights,
the motors, the vehicles...

15:41.957 --> 15:45.502
...all run by a high-powered gas
called methane.

15:46.295 --> 15:48.797
Methane comes from pigshit.

15:50.299 --> 15:53.010
Have a look.
Tell me what you see.

15:55.179 --> 15:58.348
I see a big guy
giving a little guy a piggyback.

15:59.057 --> 16:01.435
MasterBlaster. They're a unit.

16:01.685 --> 16:03.729
They even share the same name.

16:03.979 --> 16:07.733
The little one is called
Master. He's the brains.

16:08.150 --> 16:10.027
He runs Underworld.

16:10.652 --> 16:14.323
The other one is Blaster.
He's the muscle.

16:14.906 --> 16:17.326
Together they can be very powerful.

16:20.162 --> 16:22.330
They are also arrogant.

16:23.248 --> 16:26.668
We want to keep the brain,
dump the body.

16:26.918 --> 16:28.753
He's big. Is he good?

16:30.005 --> 16:32.674
He can beat most men with his breath.

16:32.924 --> 16:35.594
I want a closer look at him.
How do I get in there?

16:35.844 --> 16:38.805
- It's a factory. Ask for work.
- I know nothing about methane.

16:40.181 --> 16:42.100
You can shovel shit, can't you?

17:29.939 --> 17:31.399
Hey, you!

17:32.150 --> 17:33.401
Let's talk!

17:37.238 --> 17:41.409
Here, free man, come help a convict.
You don't want to end up like me.

17:41.826 --> 17:43.411
How long are you in for?

17:43.744 --> 17:45.496
The big one. Life.

17:47.123 --> 17:47.999
For killing a pig?

17:48.583 --> 17:50.459
I had to feed the kids.

17:50.918 --> 17:54.964
Doesn't worry me. Down here
life's two, three years.

18:08.477 --> 18:11.814
Where is that bum mechanic Blackfinger?

18:22.825 --> 18:24.451
We got a real problem.

18:24.785 --> 18:27.371
Twelve pounds of dynamite set to blow.

18:28.622 --> 18:31.000
You expert! Disarm!

18:31.500 --> 18:32.626
Right.

18:44.930 --> 18:49.309
It's a class job. One mistake,
it'll blow the crap out of this place.

18:49.601 --> 18:52.020
- Literally.
- Think what to do!

18:54.773 --> 18:58.527
Now...the dynamite is connected
to the timing device...

18:58.819 --> 19:01.864
...which is connected to the switch,
which I can't find...

19:02.156 --> 19:05.075
...which is connected to the...

19:05.450 --> 19:06.535
...battery.

19:06.952 --> 19:10.080
- I'll disconnect the battery!
- I wouldn't do that.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.126
Who you?

19:14.376 --> 19:16.044
- Me Max.
- You smart.

19:16.670 --> 19:17.921
That's my vehicle.

19:18.297 --> 19:19.172
Disarm!

19:19.840 --> 19:20.716
How much?

19:20.966 --> 19:22.968
No trade. Do!

19:25.637 --> 19:26.805
Fetch!

19:32.102 --> 19:35.397
Me order. Me Master!

19:36.064 --> 19:38.108
Me run Bartertown!

19:38.900 --> 19:40.694
That's why you live in shit.

19:41.069 --> 19:43.071
Not shit! Energy!

19:43.697 --> 19:46.408
Call it what you like,
it still smells like shit.

19:46.700 --> 19:50.870
Not shit! Energy!
No energy, no town!

19:51.288 --> 19:53.498
Me King Arab!

19:53.748 --> 19:55.375
Sure. Me, fairy princess.

19:56.001 --> 19:57.544
Embargo, on!

20:18.022 --> 20:20.817
Embargo on! Main valve off!

20:35.915 --> 20:39.168
Four, three, two...

20:40.002 --> 20:41.713
For God's sake, what now?

20:42.547 --> 20:44.799
Who run Bartertown?

20:45.341 --> 20:47.927
Damn it!
I told you, no more embargos.

20:50.596 --> 20:51.514
More, Blaster.

20:59.313 --> 21:00.690
Who run Bartertown?

21:04.402 --> 21:07.363
Who run Bartertown?

21:08.072 --> 21:09.740
You know who.

21:10.199 --> 21:11.367
Say.

21:12.535 --> 21:14.036
MasterBlaster.

21:14.704 --> 21:17.081
Say loud.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.043
MasterBlaster.

21:22.044 --> 21:24.588
MasterBlaster what?

21:27.049 --> 21:29.885
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

21:30.219 --> 21:31.637
Louder!

21:32.888 --> 21:35.766
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

21:36.225 --> 21:38.394
Lift embargo.

22:05.629 --> 22:07.756
You want foot in face?

22:09.299 --> 22:10.759
Disarm.

22:11.927 --> 22:13.595
Good boy.

22:49.381 --> 22:51.007
Over here, Blaster.

23:19.828 --> 23:22.330
- What are you laying for?
- Nothing.

23:22.664 --> 23:23.832
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

23:24.082 --> 23:28.002
No, mister, I can feel it.
The dice are rolling!

23:34.467 --> 23:37.887
I want my camels, my vehicle,
food, water, methane.

23:40.098 --> 23:42.016
- Deal.
- You said a fair fight.

23:42.266 --> 23:45.687
- What does that mean?
- As provided by law.

23:46.229 --> 23:47.397
Thunderdome.

23:51.692 --> 23:56.197
Two men, hand-to-hand.
No jury, no appeal, no parole.

23:56.572 --> 23:58.533
Two men enter, one man leaves.

24:00.493 --> 24:01.702
Weapons?

24:02.078 --> 24:05.206
Anything's possible.
Chance decides.

24:05.915 --> 24:08.542
Thunderdome.
How do I get in there?

24:08.876 --> 24:11.254
That's easy. Pick a fight.

24:48.624 --> 24:50.793
Everybody have a good time!

24:53.379 --> 24:56.965
That's my vehicle
and I want it back!

24:57.424 --> 24:59.760
Hearing wonky.
Sounds like an order.

25:00.844 --> 25:01.929
That's right.

25:02.346 --> 25:06.600
Yumping Yesus! Him sad.
Brain broken.

25:08.477 --> 25:10.103
Me explain.

25:10.979 --> 25:13.732
This my vehicle. You...

25:14.274 --> 25:15.943
...pedestrian!

25:20.447 --> 25:21.531
Three seconds...

25:21.990 --> 25:23.742
...break neck. One...

25:34.252 --> 25:35.545
MasterBlaster!

25:36.129 --> 25:38.298
Listen to the law!

25:38.673 --> 25:42.010
Aunty, two men in dispute.

25:45.347 --> 25:47.641
These our witness, Aunty.

25:48.016 --> 25:51.520
Us suffer bad.
Us want justice.

25:51.978 --> 25:54.773
We want Thunderdome!

25:55.357 --> 25:59.319
You know the law.
Two men enter, one man leaves.

26:01.988 --> 26:06.993
This Blaster.
Twenty men enter, only him leave.

26:07.494 --> 26:10.455
Then it's your choice.
Thunderdome.

26:43.863 --> 26:46.866
Aunty! Aunty!

26:50.370 --> 26:54.373
Welcome to another edition
of Thunderdome!

27:18.940 --> 27:21.233
Listen on! Listen on!

27:21.984 --> 27:23.736
This is the truth of it.

27:24.111 --> 27:28.282
Fighting leads to killing,
and killing gets to warring.

27:28.657 --> 27:31.702
And that was damn near
the death of us all.

27:32.578 --> 27:37.082
Look at us now, busted up
and everyone talking about hard rain.

27:37.625 --> 27:42.254
But we've learned by the dust
of them all. Bartertown's learned.

27:42.796 --> 27:46.091
Now when men get to fighting,
it happens here.

27:46.425 --> 27:48.469
And it finishes here.

27:48.761 --> 27:52.765
Two men enter, one man leaves.

27:53.015 --> 27:56.185
Two men enter, one man leaves.

28:17.164 --> 28:20.709
And right now,
I've got two men.

28:21.668 --> 28:24.630
Two men with a gut full of fear.

28:25.672 --> 28:29.968
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

28:32.471 --> 28:34.765
...dying time's here!

28:36.475 --> 28:39.811
He's the ball cracker.
Death on foot.

28:40.354 --> 28:44.232
You know him. You love him!
He's Blaster!

28:56.786 --> 28:59.039
The challenger,
direct from out of the Wasteland.

28:59.331 --> 29:02.375
He's bad. He's beautiful.
He's crazy!

29:03.335 --> 29:06.087
It's the man with no name!

30:01.017 --> 30:05.229
Thunderdome's simple. Get to the
weapons, use them anyway you can.

30:05.605 --> 30:09.108
I know you won't break the rules.
There aren't any.

30:14.614 --> 30:15.740
Remember where you are.

30:17.074 --> 30:18.451
This is Thunderdome.

30:18.910 --> 30:23.581
Death is listening, and will take
the first man that screams.

30:25.625 --> 30:26.959
Prepare!

30:45.936 --> 30:48.397
Two men enter, one man leaves!

35:24.379 --> 35:26.923
Kill him!

35:52.282 --> 35:54.158
- You know the law!
- This is Thunderdome!

35:54.367 --> 35:55.243
Kill him!

35:55.493 --> 35:58.579
No, no! Look at his face!

35:59.747 --> 36:01.165
He's got the mind of a child.

36:05.461 --> 36:07.255
It's not his fault.

36:10.633 --> 36:12.593
Blaster, I'm sorry.

36:13.261 --> 36:15.054
This wasn't part of the deal.

36:15.721 --> 36:16.597
Deal?

36:19.267 --> 36:20.977
What do you mean, "deal"?

36:22.562 --> 36:26.107
You must have tasted it.
It was in your hands.

36:26.774 --> 36:27.942
You had it all!

36:29.193 --> 36:30.736
What do you mean, "deal"?

36:35.283 --> 36:36.701
No more methane!

36:37.285 --> 36:39.954
This place...finished!

36:40.204 --> 36:41.497
No, little man.

36:41.872 --> 36:43.457
We've only just begun.

36:49.672 --> 36:51.257
Oh, no.

36:51.757 --> 36:53.342
No, no.

37:10.401 --> 37:11.485
Open it.

37:16.365 --> 37:18.492
Two men enter. One man leaves!

37:18.742 --> 37:21.745
Two men enter. One man leaves!

37:54.194 --> 37:56.071
What's this?!

37:58.407 --> 38:02.869
Do you think I don't know the law?
Wasn't it me who wrote it?

38:03.203 --> 38:05.872
And this man has broken the law.

38:06.248 --> 38:08.208
Right or wrong, we had a deal.

38:08.875 --> 38:12.170
And the law says,
"Bust a deal, face the wheel."

38:12.587 --> 38:14.756
Bust a deal and face the wheel.

38:15.048 --> 38:18.051
Bust a deal and face the wheel.

38:30.480 --> 38:33.441
All our lives hang by a thread.

38:33.900 --> 38:36.403
Now we've got a man
waiting for sentence.

38:36.736 --> 38:40.073
But ain't it the truth?
You take your chances with the law.

38:40.573 --> 38:43.118
Justice is only a roll of the dice...

38:43.410 --> 38:47.413
...a flip of the coin,
a turn of the wheel.

39:36.128 --> 39:38.756
Gulag! Gulag! Gulag!

41:09.596 --> 41:10.972
Fix it.

41:11.431 --> 41:13.767
You run Bartertown.

41:14.267 --> 41:15.936
You fix.

41:24.945 --> 41:27.280
Not pigs! No!

41:47.967 --> 41:49.469
That's enough!

41:51.513 --> 41:55.141
Do you want to use him or kill him?
Bring him up.

42:09.197 --> 42:12.533
Master, do what Ironbar says.

42:13.826 --> 42:16.704
I will. Yeah, I will.

47:51.995 --> 47:53.705
Savannah!

48:00.003 --> 48:01.838
Finn, look.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.509
It's him. I finded him.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.846
It's Captain Walker.

48:53.890 --> 48:56.267
What's his talk?
- He ain't made wordstuff.

48:56.559 --> 48:59.103
It's a long track.
Maybe he's burned out.

48:59.395 --> 49:01.897
Maybe. Maybe he's just listening.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.027
Walker? Hello?

49:07.903 --> 49:10.072
Maybe he's talking,
but we ain't hearing.

49:10.448 --> 49:12.074
You see his lips ain't moving.

49:12.408 --> 49:14.243
Not with wordstuff, with sonic.

49:14.618 --> 49:17.580
That ain't never gonna
work, sonic-bonic bullshit!

49:20.583 --> 49:22.585
This is Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.295
Can you hear me?

49:25.254 --> 49:26.755
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.050
Come in.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.637
Is anybody out there?

49:37.433 --> 49:38.600
Can you read me, Walker?

49:40.019 --> 49:41.520
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

49:43.731 --> 49:44.857
Come in.

50:00.289 --> 50:01.832
What's up, Doc?

50:03.834 --> 50:05.961
Hey, take me with you!

50:08.463 --> 50:10.173
Can you hear me, Walker?

51:08.857 --> 51:10.692
Fly, Walker!

51:11.109 --> 51:13.486
Fly, Walker, fly!

51:51.107 --> 51:52.608
Who are you?

51:54.443 --> 51:55.903
Quiet!

51:58.239 --> 51:59.782
Shut up!

52:04.078 --> 52:06.080
Enough!

52:44.785 --> 52:46.328
Who are you?

52:48.455 --> 52:49.832
The waiting ones.

52:50.124 --> 52:51.291
Waiting for what?

52:51.625 --> 52:52.918
Waiting for you.

52:54.420 --> 52:55.379
And who am I?

53:00.008 --> 53:02.136
I think he be testing us.

53:04.012 --> 53:06.807
This a testing, Walker?
You reckon we been slack?

53:07.808 --> 53:09.685
I don't know.
Maybe you've been slack.

53:10.519 --> 53:14.523
We ain't. We kept it straight.
It's all there.

53:14.815 --> 53:19.152
Everything marked, everything
'membered. You wait, you'll see.

53:27.369 --> 53:30.372
This you knows.
I be First Tracker.

53:30.706 --> 53:33.125
Times past count I done the Tell.

53:33.834 --> 53:38.338
But it weren't me that tumbled Walker.
It was Savannah.

53:39.005 --> 53:41.883
So it's only right
that she take the Tell.

53:44.511 --> 53:48.890
This ain't one body's story.
It's the story of us all.

53:49.307 --> 53:52.852
We got it mouth-to-mouth.
You got to listen it and 'member.

53:53.228 --> 53:57.148
'Cause what you hears today
you got to tell the birthed tomorrow.

53:58.233 --> 54:00.443
I'm looking behind us now...

54:00.860 --> 54:02.862
...across the count of time...

54:03.196 --> 54:07.033
...down the long haul,
into history back.

54:07.367 --> 54:10.370
I sees the end what were the start.

54:10.745 --> 54:13.706
It's Pox-Eclipse, full of pain!

54:22.590 --> 54:27.220
And out of it were birthed
crackling dust and fearsome time.

54:27.554 --> 54:28.972
It were full-on winter...

54:29.389 --> 54:31.349
...and Mr. Dead chasing them all.

54:31.766 --> 54:35.770
But one he couldn't catch.
That were Captain Walker.

54:36.104 --> 54:40.733
He gathers up a gang, takes to the air
and flies to the sky!

54:42.402 --> 54:47.073
So they left their homes,
said bidey-bye to the high-scrapers...

54:47.573 --> 54:51.077
...and what were left of the knowing,
they left behind.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.413
Some say the wind just stoppered.

54:54.789 --> 54:58.125
Others reckon it were a gang
called Turbulence.

55:04.840 --> 55:06.259
And after the wreck...

55:06.676 --> 55:09.011
...some had been jumped by Mr. Dead...

55:09.387 --> 55:13.391
...but some had got the luck,
and it leads them here.

55:13.891 --> 55:18.854
One look and they's got the hots for it.
They word it "Planet Earth."

55:19.355 --> 55:23.359
And they says, "We don't need
the knowing. We can live here."

55:24.068 --> 55:27.238
"We don't need the knowing.
We can live here."

55:28.364 --> 55:31.700
Time counts and keeps counting.

55:32.243 --> 55:34.036
They gets missing what they had.

55:34.370 --> 55:37.998
They get so lonely for the
high-scrapers and the video.

55:38.290 --> 55:39.667
Videos!

55:43.921 --> 55:48.550
And they do pictures so they
'member all the knowing they lost.

55:59.311 --> 56:00.396
'Member this?

56:00.687 --> 56:02.856
Tomorrow-morrow Land!

56:03.232 --> 56:04.775
'Member this?

56:05.067 --> 56:06.902
The River of Light!

56:07.236 --> 56:08.403
'Member this?

56:08.695 --> 56:10.405
Skyraft!

56:10.697 --> 56:11.698
'Member this?

56:12.074 --> 56:14.117
Captain Walker!

56:14.368 --> 56:15.827
'Member this?

56:16.078 --> 56:17.120
Mrs. Walker!

56:20.916 --> 56:25.587
Then Captain Walker picked them
of an age and good for a long haul.

56:26.088 --> 56:30.717
They counted twenty, and that were them.
The great leaving.

56:30.967 --> 56:34.137
"Rescue party departed
at first light...

56:34.429 --> 56:37.599
...led by Flight Captain G.L. Walker."

56:37.849 --> 56:41.144
"May God have mercy on our souls."

56:42.270 --> 56:44.940
They said bidey-bye to them
what they'd birthed.

56:45.315 --> 56:47.609
And from the nothing
they looked back...

56:47.943 --> 56:51.738
...and Captain Walker hollered,
"Wait, one of us will come."

56:52.280 --> 56:55.116
"Wait, one of us will come."

56:57.285 --> 56:59.663
And somebody did come.

57:00.163 --> 57:02.040
Walker.

57:26.648 --> 57:28.983
We's heartful to you,
Captain Walker.

57:29.317 --> 57:31.945
We's ready now. Take us home.

57:41.371 --> 57:45.541
We kept it straight!
Everything marked, everything 'membered!

57:45.833 --> 57:48.503
You kept it real good.
You ain't been slack.

57:48.878 --> 57:50.838
Why are we waiting?
- That ain't me.

57:51.089 --> 57:53.591
- You got the wrong guy.
- Quit joshing!

57:54.050 --> 57:56.677
- Catch the wind.
- We got to see Tomorrow-morrow Land!

57:57.053 --> 57:59.222
Home! Tomorrow-morrow Land!

58:05.561 --> 58:08.231
There were places like these.
Cities.

58:08.481 --> 58:10.650
They were called cities.

58:11.525 --> 58:14.362
They had lots of knowing.
They had skyscrapers...

58:15.196 --> 58:17.448
...videos and they had the sonic.

58:20.534 --> 58:22.078
Then this happened.

58:22.370 --> 58:26.582
This Pox-Eclipse happened, and it's
finished. It isn't there anymore.

58:28.376 --> 58:31.712
You got to understand
that this is home...

58:32.588 --> 58:35.216
...and there's no Tomorrow Land...

58:35.716 --> 58:37.551
...and I ain't Captain Walker.

59:09.333 --> 59:11.084
This is it!

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.565
We's loaded and waiting, Captain.

01:00:57.815 --> 01:01:00.902
We got the wind
up our arse, Captain. Let's go!

01:02:49.176 --> 01:02:51.219
Who's coming?
We's pulling a leaving.

01:02:51.803 --> 01:02:55.765
There ain't gonna be no leavings.
All that's just jerking time.

01:02:56.016 --> 01:02:57.309
We's working it different.

01:02:57.726 --> 01:03:00.812
Ain't you seen nothing?
He couldn't catch the wind.

01:03:01.146 --> 01:03:04.149
There weren't no skyrafting.
There won't be no salvage.

01:03:04.482 --> 01:03:07.277
This is our Tomorrow-morrow Land.
He's proof of that.

01:03:07.569 --> 01:03:12.490
Program! All of you program.
If he ain't Captain Walker, who is he?

01:03:13.199 --> 01:03:16.036
He ain't no different
to us. He slogged it on foot.

01:03:16.828 --> 01:03:18.997
If he can get here,
we can get back.

01:03:19.331 --> 01:03:20.999
He ain't much bigger than us.

01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:23.752
Copilot did it.
So why can't we?

01:03:24.002 --> 01:03:26.337
That's the trick of it.
Who's coming?

01:03:27.338 --> 01:03:30.508
Across the nothing?
Don't you 'member?

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:34.179
When you finded him,
he were half jumped by Mr. Dead.

01:03:34.429 --> 01:03:37.223
Nobody's saying
it ain't a hard slog.

01:03:37.515 --> 01:03:40.268
If we wants the knowing,
it ain't an easy ride.

01:03:40.518 --> 01:03:42.395
There ain't no knowing!

01:03:42.645 --> 01:03:47.025
There ain't no skyraft and no sonic.
You slog out there to nothing!

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.693
Worse than nothing.

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:52.572
The first place you'll find
is a sleaze pit called Bartertown.

01:03:52.864 --> 01:03:56.117
If the earth doesn't swallow you up,
that place will.

01:03:58.953 --> 01:04:02.540
Listen him! There ain't no
Tomorrow-morrow Land!

01:04:02.832 --> 01:04:04.500
We done that!

01:04:04.751 --> 01:04:06.961
He's got wordstuff out his ass!

01:04:07.336 --> 01:04:10.590
Whoever's got the juice,
track with us.

01:04:52.423 --> 01:04:53.924
Now listen good!

01:04:55.426 --> 01:05:00.139
I'm not Captain Walker. I'm the guy
who keeps Mr. Dead in his pocket.

01:05:01.599 --> 01:05:04.101
And I say we're gonna stay here.

01:05:04.435 --> 01:05:08.439
And we'll live a long time
and we'll be thankful.

01:05:09.523 --> 01:05:10.441
Right?

01:05:12.443 --> 01:05:14.111
Keep tracking.

01:06:09.082 --> 01:06:10.625
Slake!

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.003
Get the others.

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:16.941
They've gone.
You got to get them back!

01:07:17.275 --> 01:07:21.279
They've gone! Scrooloose let them go.
They're in the nothing.

01:07:21.571 --> 01:07:25.908
Come on, you got to help me!
You got to help me get them back!

01:07:28.452 --> 01:07:30.413
Savannah and Gekko.
He can hardly walk.

01:07:30.705 --> 01:07:34.709
Little Finn, Mr. Skyfish, and Cusha.
She's gonna pop any day now.

01:08:03.904 --> 01:08:05.030
- How long?
- Half a night.

01:08:05.322 --> 01:08:07.658
Maybe less.
They be deep in the nothing.

01:08:07.908 --> 01:08:10.411
Without much water.
- It makes no difference.

01:08:10.661 --> 01:08:12.788
They'll be swallowed up by the sand.

01:08:13.038 --> 01:08:14.415
Get them back, Captain!

01:08:14.957 --> 01:08:18.502
Stop with the "Captain."
Stop the noise!

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:26.969
I need water to carry.

01:08:41.316 --> 01:08:42.401
What are you doing?

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:44.987
I's coming salvage for my buddies.

01:08:47.029 --> 01:08:48.782
We needs a hunter.

01:10:21.916 --> 01:10:24.127
He holds his own, okay?

01:11:35.697 --> 01:11:37.199
Help! Help me!

01:13:14.754 --> 01:13:16.422
Quick, let's trek!

01:13:30.269 --> 01:13:31.938
Is it Tomorrow-morrow Land?

01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:35.066
No. Bartertown.

01:13:36.234 --> 01:13:37.693
It's our only chance.

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:41.113
Get in, we're right behind you.

01:13:41.405 --> 01:13:43.574
Wait! Stick together!

01:13:43.908 --> 01:13:45.242
Where are we?

01:13:46.452 --> 01:13:47.578
It's Bartertown.

01:13:47.953 --> 01:13:49.914
It stinks!

01:13:50.456 --> 01:13:52.833
Tubba, Cusha, wait up!

01:13:54.835 --> 01:13:56.170
Which way?

01:13:56.754 --> 01:13:58.464
Head for the light.

01:14:02.676 --> 01:14:05.805
Where are the others?
- They've gone ahead.

01:14:06.263 --> 01:14:08.599
How far?
- A long way.

01:14:08.974 --> 01:14:11.769
Can you see them?
- Only just!

01:14:17.608 --> 01:14:19.777
What are we doing?
What's our program?

01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:21.362
We're looking for someone.

01:14:21.612 --> 01:14:24.114
In here? This is jerking time!

01:14:24.365 --> 01:14:27.618
A little guy with the knowing
of a lot of things. Understand?

01:14:27.868 --> 01:14:30.454
Yeah.
- Well, shut up!

01:14:31.163 --> 01:14:32.831
What's to see, Captain?

01:14:33.165 --> 01:14:34.291
Quiet!

01:14:42.174 --> 01:14:44.927
It's him, Captain!
It's the little guy!

01:14:45.177 --> 01:14:50.307
Little? He's the smallest!
What the fuck, Captain. What use is he?

01:14:50.891 --> 01:14:52.142
Shh! Quiet!

01:14:54.853 --> 01:14:57.189
- Where are the others?
- Out there.

01:15:59.167 --> 01:16:00.502
Screwy, let's fly!

01:16:33.785 --> 01:16:34.952
Excuse me.

01:17:28.213 --> 01:17:29.340
Hold it!

01:17:32.134 --> 01:17:35.971
Remember...no matter where you go,
there you are.

01:18:27.939 --> 01:18:29.191
Hi.

01:19:15.445 --> 01:19:17.572
All aboard!

01:20:14.086 --> 01:20:15.004
Go!

01:20:16.297 --> 01:20:17.798
Hang on!

01:21:41.715 --> 01:21:44.217
Chase now, pay later.

01:22:06.406 --> 01:22:09.409
Bartertown!
Listen to me!

01:22:13.079 --> 01:22:14.414
Where are you gonna run?

01:22:14.956 --> 01:22:18.293
Where are you gonna hide?
Listen to me!

01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:20.753
Bartertown will live!

01:22:21.421 --> 01:22:23.089
Find the little man.

01:22:23.423 --> 01:22:26.092
Bring him back to me...alive!

01:22:26.759 --> 01:22:28.428
We will rebuild!

01:22:31.764 --> 01:22:35.059
For those who took him...no mercy!

01:23:19.687 --> 01:23:21.689
So, what's the plan?

01:23:23.107 --> 01:23:24.233
Plan?

01:23:25.151 --> 01:23:27.069
There ain't no plan.

01:23:51.051 --> 01:23:52.261
Skyfish, look!

01:23:55.514 --> 01:23:57.057
It's got to be!

01:24:01.687 --> 01:24:03.188
The sonic!

01:24:04.398 --> 01:24:06.191
Gekko got it straight.

01:24:06.525 --> 01:24:07.693
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

01:24:08.402 --> 01:24:09.486
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.
- Come in.

01:24:29.715 --> 01:24:33.051
Welcome. Open your book at page one.

01:24:35.595 --> 01:24:38.390
Now repeat after me. Bonjour.

01:24:40.058 --> 01:24:41.393
Good morning.

01:24:43.061 --> 01:24:45.021
Où allez-vous?

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.567
Where are you going?

01:24:51.403 --> 01:24:53.655
Je vais chez moi.

01:24:56.074 --> 01:24:57.909
I am going home.

01:25:02.205 --> 01:25:03.540
I am going home.

01:25:26.604 --> 01:25:27.939
He's got the man!

01:27:21.093 --> 01:27:22.427
Ah, Pigkiller!

01:27:22.761 --> 01:27:23.720
Wait...

01:29:02.151 --> 01:29:04.612
Blackfinger! Pull the pin!

01:29:05.321 --> 01:29:06.989
Do it now!

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:11.244
Hold it, Blackfinger!

01:29:26.634 --> 01:29:27.593
Give him back!

01:29:28.094 --> 01:29:29.220
Let go!

01:29:30.179 --> 01:29:32.139
Blackfinger, let go!

01:29:32.389 --> 01:29:34.183
I've got you now,
and I'm going home!

01:29:36.727 --> 01:29:38.187
You'll be all right.

01:30:13.472 --> 01:30:14.389
Come on now!

01:31:01.353 --> 01:31:03.647
We're gonna count to three.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:06.816
One...

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.655
What happened to two?

01:31:29.214 --> 01:31:31.216
JEDEDIAH JR.
This is a stickup!

01:31:31.466 --> 01:31:34.886
Anybody moves, and they're dead meat!

01:31:40.683 --> 01:31:43.186
I think we're all dead meat!

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.021
Dad! We're dead meat!

01:32:29.565 --> 01:32:32.401
JEDEDIAH JR.
Quick, get in the plane!

01:32:35.446 --> 01:32:36.822
Which way did he go?

01:32:37.072 --> 01:32:38.783
I warned you, Dad!

01:32:48.417 --> 01:32:50.085
- You!
- Me?

01:32:50.961 --> 01:32:52.796
You. It's your lucky day.

01:32:53.547 --> 01:32:54.548
It is?

01:32:55.215 --> 01:32:56.175
You got a plane.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.093
I have?

01:33:02.931 --> 01:33:04.516
It might save your life.

01:33:05.768 --> 01:33:07.061
It will?

01:33:35.005 --> 01:33:37.299
All right, let her go!

01:33:41.261 --> 01:33:43.013
Come on, come on.

01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:46.600
What's the problem?

01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:48.643
We're not gonna get off the ground.

01:33:49.352 --> 01:33:50.645
We're overloaded!

01:34:21.885 --> 01:34:25.096
Dad, you better do something!

01:35:04.135 --> 01:35:06.554
- Kick her in the guts.
- Not gonna make it.

01:35:06.971 --> 01:35:08.264
Not enough runway.

01:35:08.514 --> 01:35:10.016
We haven't any choice.

01:35:10.266 --> 01:35:11.142
Between them...

01:35:11.434 --> 01:35:14.562
...and us, there's not enough runway.

01:35:17.773 --> 01:35:19.108
There will be.

01:37:57.181 --> 01:37:59.142
Ain't we a pair...

01:37:59.851 --> 01:38:01.185
...raggedy man.

01:38:10.403 --> 01:38:11.946
Goodbye, soldier.

01:40:11.648 --> 01:40:15.235
This you knows.
The years travel fast.

01:40:15.694 --> 01:40:18.530
And time after time
I've done the Tell.

01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:22.993
But this ain't one body's Tell.
It's the Tell of us all.

01:40:23.535 --> 01:40:26.204
And you got to listen it and 'member.

01:40:26.746 --> 01:40:31.376
'Cause what you hears today,
you got to tell the newborn tomorrow.

01:40:32.085 --> 01:40:36.089
I's looking behind us now,
into history back.

01:40:36.381 --> 01:40:40.552
I sees those of us that got the luck
and started the haul for home.

01:40:40.844 --> 01:40:45.974
It lead us here and we was heartful
'cause we seen what there once was.

01:40:47.058 --> 01:40:50.436
One look, and we knewed
we'd got it straight.

01:40:50.895 --> 01:40:55.400
Those what had gone before had knowing
of things beyond our reckoning...

01:40:55.775 --> 01:40:57.777
...even beyond our dreaming.

01:40:59.237 --> 01:41:02.115
Time counts and keeps counting.

01:41:02.949 --> 01:41:04.575
And we knows now...

01:41:04.909 --> 01:41:08.913
...finding the trick of what's
been and lost ain't no easy ride.

01:41:09.747 --> 01:41:12.917
But that's our track.
We got to travel it.

01:41:13.251 --> 01:41:16.087
And there ain't nobody knows
where it's gonna lead.

01:41:17.255 --> 01:41:21.092
Still and all, every night
we does the Tell...

01:41:21.425 --> 01:41:25.429
...so that we 'member who we was
and where we came from.

01:41:26.264 --> 01:41:29.767
But most of all we 'members
the man who finded us...

01:41:30.434 --> 01:41:32.436
...him that came the salvage.

01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:35.940
And we lights the city.
Not just for him...

01:41:36.315 --> 01:41:38.943
...but for all of them
that are still out there.

01:41:39.485 --> 01:41:42.007
'Cause we knows there'll
come a night...

01:41:42.446 --> 01:41:44.657
... when they sees the distant light...

01:41:44.949 --> 01:41:46.951
...and they'll be coming home.

01:44:46.952 --> 01:44:47.952
