WEBVTT

00:02.079 --> 00:06.004
Torchwood. Outside the
government, beyond the police.

00:06.039 --> 00:11.439
Tracking down alien life on earth,
arming the human race against the future.

00:11.474 --> 00:14.280
The 21st century is when
everything changes

00:14.315 --> 00:15.960
and you've got to be ready.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.564
MOBILE RINGS

00:32.598 --> 00:35.005
Dad? I dunno, hour and half, tops.

00:35.040 --> 00:38.959
I'll be there soon as I can.
I can't hear you.

00:38.994 --> 00:41.320
The signal's going.

01:14.239 --> 01:16.765
Hello?

01:16.800 --> 01:18.240
Are you all right?

02:05.239 --> 02:07.239
Come on!

02:11.959 --> 02:14.179
CLATTERING

02:14.214 --> 02:16.399
METAL SCRAPES

02:19.039 --> 02:21.360
Leave me alone!

02:21.395 --> 02:23.319
BANG

02:25.039 --> 02:27.319
SHE SCREAMS

02:29.519 --> 02:31.560
SCREAMING CONTINUES

02:48.480 --> 02:50.725
I hate the countryside.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.644
It's dirty, it's unhygienic.

02:53.679 --> 02:56.879
And what is that smell?
That would be grass.

02:56.914 --> 02:59.400
It's disgusting.

03:02.919 --> 03:06.920
Seventeen disappearances
within the last five months.

03:06.955 --> 03:09.479
Police are clueless.
Now there's a surprise.

03:09.514 --> 03:11.845
No offence, PC Cooper.

03:11.880 --> 03:16.000
The last known whereabouts of
each one is somewhere around here.

03:16.035 --> 03:18.485
All within a 20-mile radius.

03:18.520 --> 03:22.339
Anything else linking them? None
of the bodies have ever been found.

03:22.374 --> 03:26.159
These people just fell off the
radar. No patterns in age, sex, race.

03:26.194 --> 03:28.757
One minute they're here, the next...
boof. Gone.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.395
The rift doesn't spread
out this far. Does it?

03:31.430 --> 03:33.815
We don't know that much
about it to be certain.

03:33.850 --> 03:36.165
And it's increasing in
activity all the time.

03:36.200 --> 03:41.124
Come on, aliens aren't gonna
bother hanging around out here.

03:41.159 --> 03:47.439
Probably some sort of weird suicide club with
people choosing the same spot to end it all.

03:47.474 --> 03:50.439
God knows, if I had to spend too
long up here, I'd want to top myself.

03:50.474 --> 03:52.724
Here you go.

03:52.759 --> 03:56.360
Careful, they're hot.
Sure you don't want anything, Tosh?

03:56.395 --> 03:58.405
Really sure.

03:58.440 --> 04:02.560
A friend of mine caught hepatitis
off a burger from one of these places.

04:04.279 --> 04:07.039
We'll start with the most
recent victim, Ellie Johnson.

04:07.074 --> 04:09.760
We last have record of
her making a phone call.

04:09.795 --> 04:12.837
She dropped out of signal mid-call.

04:12.872 --> 04:15.879
The coverage map has her placed...

04:15.914 --> 04:19.325
somewhere about here.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.079
Looks as good a place
as any to set up camp.

04:23.114 --> 04:25.759
Sorry, did you say camp?

04:27.279 --> 04:30.560
What's the matter with a hotel?
People are going missing round here.

04:30.595 --> 04:32.800
D'you really wanna stay in
a place run by strangers?

04:32.835 --> 04:35.244
Cos sleeping outside
is a lot safer

04:35.279 --> 04:37.360
No other race
in the universe goes camping.

04:37.395 --> 04:39.640
Celebrate your own uniqueness.

04:42.559 --> 04:46.319
What am I supposed to do with this?
Need a hand getting it up, Owen?

04:47.880 --> 04:50.479
If I did, I wouldn't ask you.

04:59.839 --> 05:01.159
Some pieces are missing!

05:01.194 --> 05:02.937
No. I checked.

05:02.972 --> 05:04.680
HEAVY BREATHING

05:10.599 --> 05:13.459
Oh, come on! It's just a bit of fun!
Who was the last person you snogged?

05:13.494 --> 05:16.320
See! You even sound like an
eight-year-old! Who the hell says "snog"?

05:16.355 --> 05:19.000
Mine was... Rhys!
Yeah, well, there's a surprise.

05:19.035 --> 05:21.337
Tosh, your go. It's easy for you!

05:21.372 --> 05:23.640
Oh, come on! Spill the beans!

05:23.675 --> 05:25.604
Owen. What?

05:25.639 --> 05:28.324
Really? Tosh, in your dreams.

05:28.359 --> 05:31.999
3am, Christmas Eve,
in front of the Millennium Centre.

05:32.034 --> 05:34.205
Waiting for a cab. I had mistletoe.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.759
Christmas?! You've not had
a snog since. No.

05:41.159 --> 05:42.924
Well.

05:42.959 --> 05:44.440
Lucky me, eh?

05:46.080 --> 05:47.840
So who was yours?

05:53.560 --> 05:56.479
Gwen, actually.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.000
When was this?

06:02.359 --> 06:05.164
It was complicated.

06:05.199 --> 06:08.800
Didn't take you long to get
your feet under the table.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.805
What?

06:10.840 --> 06:12.760
So was it just a kiss, or...

06:12.795 --> 06:15.480
Tosh, leave it.

06:17.039 --> 06:19.684
Jack?

06:19.719 --> 06:24.360
Are we including non-human lifeforms? Oh,
you haven't! You're a sick man, Harkness!

06:24.395 --> 06:28.000
That is disgusting!
I never know when he's joking.

06:28.035 --> 06:30.319
It's my turn, is it?

06:31.240 --> 06:33.639
It was Lisa.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.885
lanto, I'm sorry...

06:41.920 --> 06:44.119
Sorry she's dead?
Or sorry you mentioned it?

06:44.154 --> 06:46.400
I just didn't think.

06:46.435 --> 06:48.280
You forgot.

06:56.399 --> 06:59.479
We should get some firewood.
I'll give you a hand.

07:09.320 --> 07:12.960
Couldn't you have kept that to yourself?
What's the matter, you embarrassed?

07:12.995 --> 07:15.485
You're such an arrogant
shit sometimes, Owen!

07:15.520 --> 07:19.639
That was a good kiss. It was borderline great.
So good, you've been avoiding me ever since.

07:19.674 --> 07:21.919
Country air's making you delusional.
How long did it last? Ten seconds?

07:21.954 --> 07:25.256
But the things I can tell
from that kiss. Oh, like?

07:25.291 --> 07:28.524
Like your sex life ain't up to much.
You what?!

07:28.559 --> 07:31.719
Y'see old Rhys makes the earth rumble,
but he don't make it move, does he?

07:31.754 --> 07:33.600
You might want to shut
up before I lamp you one.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.365
When was the last time
you screwed all night?

07:38.400 --> 07:43.519
When was the last time you came so hard,
and so long, you forgot where you are?

07:43.554 --> 07:48.160
Doesn't happen with him,
does it? You're too familiar.

07:48.195 --> 07:50.857
Whereas, you and me,

07:50.892 --> 07:53.519
we're not cosy at all.

07:53.554 --> 07:56.320
We'd be amazing!

07:57.039 --> 07:59.880
And that scares the shit out of you.

08:03.679 --> 08:06.679
Someone's watching us.
Through the trees.

08:06.714 --> 08:08.644
50 yards north.

08:08.679 --> 08:10.159
I just saw them move.

08:11.919 --> 08:13.885
You got your gun? Yes.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.879
You go to your left.
I'll go right.

08:19.039 --> 08:22.879
Three... two... one.

08:43.759 --> 08:45.199
BIRD FLIES OFF

08:48.160 --> 08:51.080
Bollocks! How did we lose them? Owen.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.040
Well, it's not Ellie Johnson,
that's for sure.

09:26.075 --> 09:28.045
This is a male, late 40s, 50s.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.444
Wasn't killed here. No blood
spatter or signs of a struggle.

09:30.479 --> 09:35.320
Must have been brought here after he died. Why do
that? It's not like they've tried to bury him here.

09:35.355 --> 09:39.599
Maybe you disturbed them and they
ran away. Maybe it's a warning.

09:39.634 --> 09:42.720
Whoever's responsible
marking out their territory.

09:44.079 --> 09:46.205
Cause of death? Impossible to say.

09:46.240 --> 09:49.720
The body's been stripped of
the flesh and bodily organs.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.036
Could the Weevils
have come out this far?

09:54.071 --> 09:58.072
No, Weevils don't finish
off their victims like this.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.359
Is that ours? Yeah.

10:23.559 --> 10:26.839
All right! I've said I'm sorry!
Basic security protocols, Owen!

10:26.874 --> 10:30.156
Oh, get off your high horse, Tosh!
I was carrying that stupid gear.

10:30.191 --> 10:33.404
What, the whole time? and then I was
trying to put that bloody tent up.

10:33.439 --> 10:37.999
And then... Yes, I sort of forgot that
I'd left them in there. But I'm sorry.

10:38.034 --> 10:42.164
I'm human. I ballsed up. Looks
like that body wasn't a warning.

10:42.199 --> 10:46.039
More of a decoy. That would mean
we've been watched since we've arrived.

10:46.074 --> 10:48.557
Tosh, can you get a tracking signal?

10:48.592 --> 10:51.005
Already done. I took the liberty.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.284
It's currently 3.4 miles
west from here.

10:53.319 --> 10:58.359
Gunning at ninety, no doubt. You steal a piece of
equipment like that, you drive straight on till morning.

10:58.394 --> 11:02.245
Actually, no. It's been stationary
for the past four minutes.

11:02.280 --> 11:06.325
I'd go so far as to say it was parked.
There's a small village in that area.

11:06.360 --> 11:13.440
Other than that, nothing for 30 miles. Call me
suspicious, but this has all the hallmarks of a trap.

11:13.475 --> 11:16.879
Yeah, I was just
thinking the same thing.

11:18.159 --> 11:20.160
Anyone fancy a walk?

11:40.600 --> 11:43.919
Why would anyone want to live
out here? Has the SUV moved?

11:43.954 --> 11:47.320
Not for an hour now.

12:24.999 --> 12:27.400
HEAVY BREATHING

12:28.920 --> 12:32.920
Tosh, lanto - follow
the signal, find the SUV.

12:32.955 --> 12:34.844
Owen, Gwen...

12:34.879 --> 12:38.400
Let's see
if there's any room at the inn.

13:03.599 --> 13:07.519
Pint of best please, love.
And em, yeah, get one for yourself.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.519
Where is everybody?

14:12.120 --> 14:14.124
SHE RETCHES

14:14.159 --> 14:16.445
You OK? In there.

14:16.480 --> 14:20.040
That burger coming back to haunt
you?

14:22.279 --> 14:24.160
Oh, my God...

14:25.080 --> 14:26.560
Gwen!

14:44.599 --> 14:48.559
Jack please...
something's going on here.

14:48.594 --> 14:51.760
Let's take a look in here?
Come on.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.680
One, two, three...

15:22.360 --> 15:24.079
What is it?

15:27.279 --> 15:29.440
There's another body in there.

15:29.475 --> 15:31.165
Same as the other?

15:31.200 --> 15:37.440
What did this, Jack? Cos whatever it is, it
can't be human. How far is this going to spread?

15:37.475 --> 15:42.400
Stay focused. I should be having dinner
with Rhys. What am I doing here with you?!

15:42.435 --> 15:46.159
Don't you ever get scared, Jack?
Huh?

15:47.959 --> 15:49.959
There's another two houses.

15:49.994 --> 15:51.960
We'd better take a look.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.645
Whatever they were,

16:07.680 --> 16:09.760
I hope you put up a good fight.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.080
It's just half a mile up here.

16:20.115 --> 16:22.205
Least we've still got this.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.360
Rest of my stuff was in the vehicle.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.159
DISTANT YELP

16:53.999 --> 16:56.479
What was that?

16:56.514 --> 16:58.577
Just a... fox

16:58.612 --> 17:00.605
or something.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.520
Check round the back. Yeah.

17:20.199 --> 17:22.319
ANIMAL YELP

18:09.559 --> 18:12.160
We should carry on straight up there.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.320
Tosh!

18:27.119 --> 18:30.120
Tosh!

19:18.520 --> 19:20.680
Locked? Locked.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.959
Gwen! Gwen!

19:33.994 --> 19:35.719
Gwen! Gwen.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.959
Put the gun on the floor!

19:45.000 --> 19:47.680
PUT THE GUN DOWN ON THE FLOOR!

19:47.715 --> 19:49.285
I thought you were them!

19:49.320 --> 19:54.559
I thought they'd come back for me!
Thought who had come back for you? WHO?!

19:59.479 --> 20:01.164
Gwen... Gwen!

20:01.199 --> 20:03.799
Gwen, what's happened?

20:04.359 --> 20:07.480
A kid hit her with a shotgun.

20:07.515 --> 20:09.960
I got you, I got you.

20:09.995 --> 20:11.777
Move, move!

20:11.812 --> 20:13.560
Get in.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.244
OK, I'll check upstairs.

20:25.279 --> 20:29.599
Owen! Owen! Bet you thought
you'd never be glad to see me!

20:29.634 --> 20:32.245
Right... Help me!

20:32.280 --> 20:35.400
Listen, listen, I'm going to
have a look at your wound now, OK?

20:35.435 --> 20:38.640
Just keep calm.
Hands off, hands off. OK.

20:38.675 --> 20:40.405
No, don't please!

20:40.440 --> 20:42.519
Right, it could've been much worse.

20:42.554 --> 20:46.364
Hold this apply pressure.

20:46.399 --> 20:51.760
Oh, Jesus! The bullets are lodged near the
surface. You've been bloody lucky, girl.

20:51.795 --> 20:54.724
Another inch to the left

20:54.759 --> 21:00.120
and any one of your vital
organs might've been... Anyway.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.879
D'you want a quip about
feeling a small prick?

21:03.914 --> 21:06.919
No, but thanks for offering.
Here we go.

21:12.999 --> 21:17.684
All done. GOD!
Let's get these pellets out, eh?

21:17.719 --> 21:20.920
Right, there's gonna be
a certain amount of residue.

21:20.955 --> 21:24.360
So just lie back
and think of Torchwood.

21:45.519 --> 21:48.439
D'you miss being a doctor?
Excuse me,

21:48.474 --> 21:51.045
I still am a doctor.

21:51.080 --> 21:55.560
I just don't deal with
patients any more, that's all.

21:55.595 --> 21:57.324
It's ideal.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.240
That was the bit I always hated.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.519
You beauty.

22:12.239 --> 22:15.160
Come on. I'm good.

22:15.195 --> 22:17.239
Not bad.

22:31.560 --> 22:36.439
What's taking Tosh and lanto so long? Jack, the
SUV might be locked up. Or they could be dead!

22:36.474 --> 22:39.800
Well, everyone else is. Sit down!

22:39.835 --> 22:41.605
Tell us what happened here.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.364
It's not human. Look,
my mum won't know what's happened.

22:44.399 --> 22:48.439
They're expecting me back for the
weekend. Look, we'll get you home OK.

22:48.474 --> 22:51.045
What are you going to do?
You can't fight them.

22:51.080 --> 22:55.840
They're too strong. The only thing
we can do is barricade the door.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.565
No! We'll make base at the pub.

22:57.600 --> 23:02.479
Should we go after Tosh and lanto? Not till we know
what we're dealing with. But what if it's too late?

23:02.514 --> 23:05.277
They're not children.
They know what to do.

23:05.312 --> 23:08.040
Let's go.
It's all right. I've got her.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.880
Owen, I want to do it on my own.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.240
Look, I'm sorry about your friends.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.160
You know, I never liked camping.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.959
Don't bother. They took the guns.

23:53.280 --> 23:59.200
Charming place they've got. Judging
by the sound reverberations...

23:59.235 --> 24:02.845
and the air quality,
pretty deep underground.

24:02.880 --> 24:07.759
Chances of rescue? We won't need rescuing. I
haven't met a cell yet I couldn't get out of.

24:07.794 --> 24:11.880
What were they? I don't know.

24:11.915 --> 24:13.639
It happened too quickly.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.999
Are you worried?

24:17.034 --> 24:19.564
A little. Only...

24:19.599 --> 24:22.279
that body we saw, in the forest.

24:22.314 --> 24:23.965
Don't think about it.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.159
See if you can get
that light to work, huh?

24:29.839 --> 24:32.844
You're used to this, aren't you?

24:32.879 --> 24:36.579
That facial expression you all share.

24:36.614 --> 24:40.244
When things get a bit...
out of control.

24:40.279 --> 24:45.364
Like you enjoy it. Like you get a high from
the danger. You want me to apologise for that?

24:45.399 --> 24:50.280
Don't you ever wonder how long you can survive
before you go mad, or get killed, or lose a loved one?

24:50.315 --> 24:52.324
It's worth the risk.

24:52.359 --> 24:54.880
To protect people.
And who protects us?!

24:59.760 --> 25:03.919
God, I'm hungry. You should
have had that cheeseburger.

25:03.954 --> 25:06.537
Not THAT hungry.

25:06.572 --> 25:09.085
What's that?

25:09.120 --> 25:12.799
You've found something?

25:12.834 --> 25:14.485
It's just a shoe.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.319
Wait, there's another.

25:21.919 --> 25:24.484
There's dozens of them.

25:24.519 --> 25:27.759
Oh, my God...
How many people have been down here?

25:27.794 --> 25:29.599
And what happened to them?

25:31.239 --> 25:32.719
Is that a fridge?

25:41.920 --> 25:45.439
Tosh, what is it, what's in there?

25:45.474 --> 25:47.084
Tell me!

25:47.119 --> 25:49.479
lanto, don't. I want to know!

25:53.280 --> 25:56.920
That's why there was
nothing left on the body.

25:56.955 --> 25:59.240
They need to eat.

25:59.275 --> 26:00.880
We're food.

26:03.799 --> 26:06.884
So, if we barricade ourselves in,
what happens to Tosh and lanto?

26:06.919 --> 26:11.804
Why are we still talking about this?
Tosh and lanto can look after themselves.

26:11.839 --> 26:16.719
The kid is our first responsibility and they've
already been for him once. They're not going to give up.

26:16.754 --> 26:21.519
So have we ever heard of a species who strip
human bodies of flesh and organs? You need to rest.

26:21.554 --> 26:25.160
I'm compiling what we've got.
Seeing if it helps.

26:26.479 --> 26:31.719
We have to assume the others who disappeared
have been killed. 17 deaths? At least.

26:31.754 --> 26:33.805
These aren't casual killers.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.524
OK. So all this means
is the rift is spreading.

26:36.559 --> 26:39.960
Dumping aliens and psychos
wherever it fancies. Looks like that.

26:39.995 --> 26:43.200
Great. This conversation's
cheered me up no end.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.897
Did you see that? Something outside?

26:45.932 --> 26:48.559
Was that the same one or different?

26:53.799 --> 26:55.564
He said they'd come back.

26:55.599 --> 26:58.805
Let's not jump to conclusions.

26:58.840 --> 27:02.439
We don't know who they are
or what their intentions are.

27:02.474 --> 27:05.440
I'm thinking that's not a good sign.

27:11.280 --> 27:15.199
They've come back.
Kieran, listen to my voice, OK.

27:15.234 --> 27:18.840
Just come back. Kieran!

27:44.479 --> 27:47.724
OK, so we didn't check the cellar.

27:47.759 --> 27:51.925
You can't let them in! Come back
from the door. Don't let them in!

27:51.960 --> 27:57.439
Sit down! We've got this under control! You don't
understand, you don't know what they're like.

28:09.679 --> 28:11.880
No, please... please, no, not me...!

28:11.915 --> 28:14.125
Kieran! HELP ME!

28:14.160 --> 28:18.880
It's pitch black. You don't have any tracking
devices! Wanna get yourself killed? Get out of my way!

28:18.915 --> 28:22.077
Look whatever's in that cellar
took three bullets. I heard it fall.

28:22.112 --> 28:25.205
Once we know what it is, we'll know
how to deal with it. You do that.

28:25.240 --> 28:29.440
We'll go after Kieran and the others. You are
wounded! Do you think that's gonna stop me?!

28:29.475 --> 28:31.159
Be careful.

28:31.194 --> 28:32.599
Go.

28:37.839 --> 28:40.680
Got to be three steel bolts -
top, middle and bottom.

28:40.715 --> 28:43.237
How are you at calculating
target stress points?

28:43.272 --> 28:45.760
Find the weakest point,
bit of brute force...

28:45.795 --> 28:47.760
Nice thought. But it's reinforced.

29:07.159 --> 29:10.240
Get off! Look at me, you idiot!
I'm not gonna hurt you!

29:10.275 --> 29:12.760
You've got a gun.
I promise, I promise.

29:14.680 --> 29:18.600
OK, OK... give her some space.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.045
Thank you.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.720
Were you injured? When they took you?

29:25.755 --> 29:28.519
Can I see? I'm a nurse.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.320
OK, OK, OK.

29:35.559 --> 29:40.039
Does anyone else know you're here?
Have you managed to call for help?

29:40.074 --> 29:42.524
We don't need any help.

29:42.559 --> 29:46.799
There's three more
of us in the village.

29:46.834 --> 29:49.039
I can't help you.

29:49.074 --> 29:52.044
I'm sorry.

29:52.079 --> 29:55.879
What d'you mean?
I've been sent to collect you.

29:55.914 --> 29:57.519
I've got to take you to them.

29:57.554 --> 29:59.320
Tell us what's going on.

29:59.355 --> 30:01.519
We can help.

30:03.319 --> 30:05.439
No-one's safe.

30:05.474 --> 30:07.560
Every ten years...

30:09.319 --> 30:11.645
.. it takes us again.

30:11.680 --> 30:14.839
What takes you? What is it?

30:14.874 --> 30:17.119
The Harvest.

30:23.640 --> 30:28.520
No, please, you have to
come with me.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.965
Help me.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.560
Please... help. Did you attack us?

31:26.595 --> 31:29.084
I'm dying, help me...

31:29.119 --> 31:31.080
I'll tell you everything...

31:40.999 --> 31:44.485
This'll help you for a short amount
of time. Now start talking.

31:44.520 --> 31:48.325
You've got to get help. I know where
you can get some. We had a deal.

31:48.360 --> 31:53.440
I help you, you tell me where they've taken the
boy and what the hell is going on around here.

31:53.475 --> 31:55.439
HE LAUGHS MIRTHLESSLY

31:56.879 --> 31:58.560
You don't know?

32:02.839 --> 32:04.159
What are you doing?!

32:04.194 --> 32:05.359
Put it back!

32:05.479 --> 32:08.044
You need to know something.

32:08.079 --> 32:11.599
A long time ago,
I was pretty good at torture.

32:11.634 --> 32:15.120
Y'see, I had quite a
reputation as the go-to guy.

32:15.155 --> 32:17.319
My job demanded
it at the time, you see.

32:17.354 --> 32:19.325
So I know

32:19.360 --> 32:24.160
where to apply the tiniest amount
of pressure to a wound like yours.

32:24.195 --> 32:28.519
You've gotta stop,
you're gonna kill me. PLEASE STOP!

32:28.554 --> 32:30.439
It's in your power to get
me to stop.

32:30.474 --> 32:32.885
Just tell me what I need to know.

32:32.920 --> 32:37.560
Because in ten seconds,
I'm gonna find a sharp object.

32:37.595 --> 32:39.364
Right.. All right.

32:39.399 --> 32:41.880
I'll tell you everything,

32:41.915 --> 32:43.480
just stop.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.999
Now talk.

32:50.479 --> 32:53.160
Are you sure you're all right?
Yeah, fine,

32:53.195 --> 32:54.960
I'm fine.

32:57.079 --> 33:02.160
That's all we bloody need. Let me
do the talking, I'll get rid of him.

33:05.439 --> 33:08.485
Who are you, please? Special Ops. From
Torchwood, have you heard of Torchwood?

33:08.520 --> 33:12.480
What's that then, a band is it? What's wrong
with her? Mate, you wouldn't understand.

33:12.515 --> 33:14.564
What's that light over there?

33:14.599 --> 33:19.165
The Big House?
Sort of unofficial village hall.

33:19.200 --> 33:22.080
Village meeting tonight, that's
why I'm here. Constabulary report.

33:22.115 --> 33:25.279
Come on.
Where do you think you're going?

33:29.760 --> 33:31.684
In there, please.

33:31.719 --> 33:35.400
If you help us,
we can stop all this. Please.

33:35.435 --> 33:37.519
I'm sorry. Get back.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.879
Oh, God, that stench...

33:55.159 --> 33:57.840
Tell us what these creatures are.

33:57.875 --> 34:00.245
Do they look like us?

34:00.280 --> 34:01.839
How else are we gonna look?

34:24.438 --> 34:29.679
There are three more out there.
Not a problem. How are they?

34:29.714 --> 34:31.840
They're in a good state.

34:39.879 --> 34:42.899
I think they're the best
we've ever had. Yeah?

34:42.934 --> 34:45.918
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
we caught the boy.

34:45.954 --> 34:47.597
Finally.

34:47.632 --> 34:49.239
Come on.

34:51.319 --> 34:54.239
I won't tell anyone!

34:56.320 --> 34:58.619
Who is he?

34:58.654 --> 35:00.919
He's meat.

35:03.840 --> 35:07.279
I'm afraid we're all just meat.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.119
Get ready to run.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.839
What're you going to do,
put us on meat hooks?

35:18.840 --> 35:21.799
No, not yet.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.645
You see... meat...

35:26.680 --> 35:30.279
has to be tenderised first.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.920
Go! Get the others!

36:15.840 --> 36:18.040
I know you're here.

37:06.799 --> 37:08.399
No-one's coming for you.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.479
SHE SCREAMS

38:17.359 --> 38:18.840
No more games.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.800
Hush now.

38:28.835 --> 38:31.080
SHE CHOKES

38:36.319 --> 38:39.960
Get off her or I'll shoot!
GET OFF HER OR I'LL SHOOT!

38:48.840 --> 38:50.280
We saw the torchlight.

38:52.639 --> 38:54.899
They've murdered all the villagers.

38:54.934 --> 38:57.124
They're cannibalising the bodies!

38:57.159 --> 39:00.880
Put the gun down. You're in no
position to negotiate, mate.

39:00.915 --> 39:02.965
S'all right, it's all right.
You're safe.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.840
You can arrest him now.
I said you can arrest him!

39:06.875 --> 39:09.725
You gonna arrest me, Huw?

39:09.760 --> 39:12.079
That'd be a laugh, wouldn't it?

39:12.114 --> 39:13.759
My own uncle.

39:15.799 --> 39:17.960
Put the gun down,
don't you hurt him.

39:17.995 --> 39:19.997
Shoot the bastard.

39:20.032 --> 39:21.964
Split his skull.

39:21.999 --> 39:24.044
Put the fucking gun down! Shoot.

39:24.079 --> 39:27.599
I will shoot you! Put it down.
Pull the trigger, kill.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.240
Why don't you give me the gun? Mate.

40:04.719 --> 40:06.404
Who are these people?

40:06.439 --> 40:09.559
This is our village.
But the villagers are dead.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.965
They're all involved.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.045
They've all been doing it.

40:17.080 --> 40:21.120
This is our Harvest.
Only in the bloody countryside!

40:21.155 --> 40:23.359
You sick fuckers.

40:32.199 --> 40:35.400
Are you OK? Where's lanto?
What have you done with him?

40:41.160 --> 40:43.579
Wake up, man.

40:43.614 --> 40:45.999
Time to be bled.

40:47.479 --> 40:50.924
Like veal, it takes a long time.

40:50.959 --> 40:54.360
But it definitely makes
the meat taste better.

41:03.799 --> 41:06.319
What the fuck...?

41:39.840 --> 41:41.319
Oh, really?

41:47.280 --> 41:50.400
No, Jack! Don't do it. These people
don't deserve warnings.

41:50.435 --> 41:53.920
Let me question him.
I have to understand.

41:53.955 --> 41:56.879
I want to know why. Otherwise this,

41:56.914 --> 41:58.645
this is too much.

41:58.680 --> 42:01.324
They're injured,
they need to get to the hospital.

42:01.359 --> 42:08.320
Owen you control the bleeding and then phone the
police. Jack, please give me an hour with him.

42:08.355 --> 42:11.279
Don't tell me you
don't want to know too.

42:29.880 --> 42:33.160
The whole village was involved.

42:33.195 --> 42:35.997
Every generation.

42:36.032 --> 42:38.176
Our tradition.

42:38.211 --> 42:40.320
Once a decade.

42:41.920 --> 42:45.519
Target those travelling through,
those most likely to disappear.

42:45.554 --> 42:47.320
And butcher them.

42:50.280 --> 42:54.759
What sort of people are you that you wake up in
the morning and think, this is what I'm going to do?

42:58.159 --> 43:00.960
Why'd you do it?

43:04.399 --> 43:07.004
Come on!

43:07.039 --> 43:09.199
Make me understand.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.325
Why do you care?

43:12.360 --> 43:15.740
I have seen things you
would never believe.

43:15.775 --> 43:19.120
And this is the only
thing I can't understand.

43:27.120 --> 43:29.640
So, keep on wondering. Tell me!

43:29.675 --> 43:32.160
I need to know why! That's enough.

43:32.195 --> 43:34.844
Time to go.

43:34.879 --> 43:37.279
I'll tell you something...

43:37.314 --> 43:39.679
if you let me whisper.

43:42.959 --> 43:44.119
OK.

43:53.520 --> 43:55.999
Come on, out..

44:31.239 --> 44:33.685
'I had a good job before this,

44:33.720 --> 44:35.685
'I thought in a year
or two, perhaps a baby,

44:35.720 --> 44:38.719
'I know Rhys would be a good dad and
I could try for Desk Sergeant and...

44:41.599 --> 44:43.999
'Well, it was all
slotting into place... '

44:45.919 --> 44:49.080
'And then I met you lot.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.719
'All these things...

44:54.319 --> 44:56.760
'.. all these things,
they're changing me.

44:58.720 --> 45:02.900
'Changing how I see the world. '

45:02.935 --> 45:07.080
And I can't share them
with anyone.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.800
You can now.

45:40.600 --> 45:45.280
What is this thing? With this you can read peoples
minds, it levels the pitch between man and God.

45:47.760 --> 45:49.364
We'll find you.

45:49.399 --> 45:52.925
My guess is you're not
from around these parts.

45:52.960 --> 45:56.040
Shagging a woman on the rebound. Wouldn't
be the first time I'd been a rebound shag.

45:59.359 --> 46:03.279
You need to see this,
this is completely impossible.

46:03.314 --> 46:06.159
Tell me what to do.
Get me into Torchwood.
