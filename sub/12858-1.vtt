WEBVTT

00:54.200 --> 00:56.700
All right, Kent!

00:57.900 --> 00:59.000
Go, Hayley.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.100
Seven minutes.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.000
Go get 'em, cowboy.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.099
See you in seven minutes.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.900
Stu, run it by me again.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.600
Kissing is first base.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.000
Second base is boob.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.600
- Third base is-
- Finger.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.200
- Finger?
- Or thumb.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.500
Okay.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.900
Charlie, trust me.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.500
Second base is what
it's all about.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.100
I'm all about the boobies.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.200
Okay.
Anything else?

01:27.300 --> 01:29.900
An intentional walk
is a kiss on the cheek.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.300
An inside park home run
is a blow job.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.600
What's a blow job?

01:33.700 --> 01:35.300
I have no idea,

01:35.400 --> 01:36.800
but I overheard my dad saying

01:36.900 --> 01:38.700
that he gets one
once a year on his birthday.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.700
So it must be good.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.800
Yeah!

01:54.900 --> 01:56.700
You, me.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.000
Closet.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.300
Seven minutes.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.400
Heaven.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.800
He's so gross.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.700
Sorry, Jennifer.

02:14.900 --> 02:15.900
Stop.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.200
Don't touch me.

02:17.300 --> 02:18.900
Stand on that side
of the closet,

02:19.000 --> 02:20.100
and I'll say we kissed.

02:20.300 --> 02:23.200
I will... if you say
we did the nasty.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.099
No.
I'll say we kissed.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.300
Say I touched your boobies.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.300
No!
I'll say we kissed.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.300
Okay.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.100
I kissed your boobies.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.600
Anisha!

03:06.700 --> 03:08.500
Stop staring.
You're freaking me out.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.300
I'm looking at you
'cause I like you, Charlie.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.700
It's okay.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.400
Come on. You can
do what you want.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.300
That's okay.
I'm kind of new at this.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.800
Let me see your penis.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.400
What's the matter?
Don't you want me?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.300
Oh, my God!

03:25.400 --> 03:26.900
That's my boy.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.200
He's probably
blow-jobbing her.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.300
Anisha!
I can't breathe!

03:37.400 --> 03:38.500
I love you, Charlie.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.600
I've loved you
since the third grade.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.300
Um... thank you?

03:41.400 --> 03:43.100
So you like to play hard to get.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.100
Back off!

03:45.200 --> 03:46.700
I've read in my mom's Cosmo

03:46.800 --> 03:49.100
this is supposed
to increase pleasure.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.200
Don't worry.
This is my first time, too.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.300
First time what, killing?

03:55.400 --> 03:56.800
No, Charlie.
Making love.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.400
Get off me, you freak!

04:05.600 --> 04:08.800
Charlie Logan, you are not
my boyfriend anymore.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.000
I hex you!

04:10.100 --> 04:11.300
You what?

04:11.400 --> 04:14.700
I hex you.
You will never be happy.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.200
Around you love will fall
like rain.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.300
But you won't hold it.
Your heart will pain!

04:21.399 --> 04:23.200
Once the girl has been with you,

04:23.400 --> 04:25.700
to the next she will be true!

04:27.400 --> 04:29.000
Was that Phil Collins?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.700
What happened?

04:38.100 --> 04:39.700
Did you thumb her?

04:53.400 --> 04:56.300
Charlie, we could get arrested
for public indecency.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.100
I like the way you think.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.300
Okay.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.500
All right!

05:28.600 --> 05:32.000
Oh, my-
Oh, my God, Carol.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.200
I love you.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.600
I love you!

05:38.700 --> 05:40.700
Thank you.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.400
I love you, Charlie.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.500
Oh, that's nice.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.300
"That's nice"?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.300
I'm licking the sand
off your balls,

05:49.400 --> 05:50.500
and you say, "That's nice"?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.700
No, I said,
"Oh, my God" to that.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.200
I said, "Oh, my God"
very enthusiastically about the ball lick.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.700
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.700
I just don't think the "L" word
should be thrown around casually.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.400
The "L" word?
What are you, eight?

06:05.600 --> 06:08.700
How about the "F" word
and the "you" word?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.500
I can't believe
you and Carol went belly-up, man.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.800
She was so into you.

06:31.900 --> 06:34.700
Yeah, well, she was
a, uh, noisy eater.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.900
It's that word, Stu: love.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.400
I wanted to say it,
but I just-I couldn't.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.900
How can I say something
if I don't feel it?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.900
Easy. Lie.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.400
What do you think
all relationships are based on, man?

06:48.500 --> 06:49.500
Lies.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.200
"No, honey, your ass
looks great in those jeans."

06:52.300 --> 06:54.900
"Honey,
I love your parents."

06:55.000 --> 06:57.440
"You're kidding me. That sore right there?
That's not herpes."

06:57.500 --> 06:58.600
You know what I'm saying?

06:58.700 --> 07:00.900
So, then, who are you
taking to Katie's wedding?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.900
Oh, I don't know.
You want to go?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.500
Do bridesmaids give head
in the coat room?

07:04.600 --> 07:07.600
Of course I want to go!

07:07.700 --> 07:10.400
You know how easy it is
to score at a wedding?

07:10.500 --> 07:12.900
Have you ever scored
at a wedding?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.800
Pacing myself.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.500
Must be weird.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.200
You were dating Katie
six months ago,

07:18.400 --> 07:19.800
and now she's marrying a doctor.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.500
I'm a doctor.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.600
He's a heart surgeon.
You're a dentist.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.700
It's like saying
General Patton and Colonel Mustard

07:25.800 --> 07:27.100
are both military men.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.100
Hi, Dr. Stu.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.200
Natalie.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.400
I jerk off to her mammograms.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.500
God, I love my job.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.100
Every day is like Christmas.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.900
Who are you working over today?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.500
Dr. Charlie,
you're five minutes late!

07:51.600 --> 07:53.300
You've got four fillings,
three cleanings,

07:53.400 --> 07:54.800
two crowns, and a canal.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.300
You've got too many patients,

07:56.400 --> 07:58.100
and I've got too little patience

07:58.200 --> 07:59.600
for you to be gabbing gossip

07:59.700 --> 08:01.600
with Dr. Boob Jobs in the hallway.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.200
How are you today, Reba?

08:03.300 --> 08:05.200
Were you just
looking at my tits?

08:05.300 --> 08:06.800
Because I am more than happy

08:06.900 --> 08:08.500
with what the Lord Almighty gave me.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.200
I wasn't looking at your-

08:10.300 --> 08:12.800
Come on, Dr. Charlie.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.400
I don't want anybody else

08:26.600 --> 08:30.500
When I think about you,
I rub myself

08:30.700 --> 08:34.999
I don't want anybody else

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
When I think about you,
I touch myself

08:39.799 --> 08:41.400
You are what-

08:41.600 --> 08:42.700
Okay, you're my wingman.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.500
If the blonde asks,

08:44.600 --> 08:47.000
I'm the billionaire
who invented string cheese.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.200
If it's that redhead,

08:48.300 --> 08:50.200
tell her I wrote
"We Are the World."

08:50.300 --> 08:52.500
And, uh, if it's
that cheerleader hottie over there,

08:52.600 --> 08:54.800
my penis is in
the Guinness Book of World Records:

08:54.900 --> 08:56.100
girth, not length.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.600
I want it to sound believable.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.200
Holy shit.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.300
Activate pelvis.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.800
Yo, yo, yo, hold on
to your pantyhose.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.500
The hostess with the mostest

09:20.600 --> 09:22.100
has got a toastess.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.200
I just want to thank everybody

09:31.300 --> 09:33.400
for coming to share
this day with us.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.400
I couldn't imagine
being any happier

09:35.500 --> 09:36.900
than I am right now.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Wait till tonight, sweetheart.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.000
I know it's a little unorthodox,

09:42.100 --> 09:45.000
but I'd also like
to propose a toast...

09:47.000 --> 09:48.600
to Charlie Logan.

09:48.700 --> 09:53.700
Thank you, Charlie,
for being my lucky charm.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.700
To Charlie!

09:54.800 --> 09:56.800
- To Charlie.
- To Charlie.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.300
So, you're that Charlie?

10:04.400 --> 10:05.599
What Charlie?

10:05.600 --> 10:09.000
You know, Charlie,
the-the dentist.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.100
- Oh, no. Are you okay?
- That's horrible.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.300
- I'm all right.
- I didn't-I didn't mean to.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.700
Sorry about that.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.100
Oh, jeez.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.600
Here you go.

10:45.700 --> 10:46.900
- Thanks.
- Sure.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.700
Oh. There I am.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.700
Join us.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.500
So, what did I miss?

10:55.600 --> 10:56.800
Not much.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.700
Same old-
I do, I do.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.100
"You may
kiss the bride."

11:00.200 --> 11:02.100
White cake
with raspberry filling,

11:02.200 --> 11:03.900
and the doves being released,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.600
but the doves refuse to leave.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.300
I'm Cam. I went
to college with the bride.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.600
I'm Charlie.
I used to date the bride.

11:13.700 --> 11:14.700
Me, too.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.900
Well, no. I mean,
it was a one-time-only

11:19.100 --> 11:20.500
experimental thing,
sophomore year.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.000
We were young.
And drunk.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.100
Is this person
being dipped in acid?

11:32.200 --> 11:35.900
Waiter, could we
have some chloroform for the singer?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.599
What are you going to sing?

11:37.600 --> 11:39.760
I'm thinking about
doing Bon Jovi "Livin' On a Prayer."

11:39.800 --> 11:41.300
Really?
That's the one I was going to do.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.700
- Oh, really?
- No.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.000
So, Cam, what do you do?

11:48.100 --> 11:50.600
I run the Penguin Habitat
at Aqua World.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.400
Seriously, what do you do?

11:54.700 --> 11:55.700
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.800
I'm a serial killer.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.000
My passion is killing people
I meet at weddings.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.000
What do you do?

12:00.100 --> 12:02.600
FBI.
You're under arrest.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.700
Your run is over, Miss "Wexler,"

12:04.800 --> 12:07.000
if that's your real name.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.600
Actually, I am a dentist.

12:10.700 --> 12:11.900
You're a dentist?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.300
You'll love me.
Perfect teeth. No cavities.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.700
Want to see?

12:16.900 --> 12:18.400
Oh, my! My legs!

12:18.600 --> 12:20.500
I'm sorry.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.600
Water!

12:23.200 --> 12:24.400
Oh, no!

12:24.500 --> 12:25.700
I'm sorry.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.000
I'll just get in there and-

12:30.300 --> 12:31.400
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.200
Wait.
Let me see, let me see.

12:33.300 --> 12:36.500
- Thanks.
- It looks like cum!

12:37.300 --> 12:38.700
Well, here I am.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.300
What are your other two wishes?

12:41.700 --> 12:44.100
Stu, Cam.
Cam, Stu.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.600
It's actually Doctor Stu.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.100
I'm a reconstructive surgeon.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.900
If anyone has an accident
or is born with a deformity,

12:52.200 --> 12:53.600
I'm there to help.

12:53.700 --> 12:55.900
And by deformity,
he means small breasts.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.900
He's just jealous

12:59.000 --> 13:01.200
because he has to clean
plaque all day long

13:01.300 --> 13:03.100
while I'm out
making the world a better place.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.900
Cam, you will not
believe this doofus

13:07.000 --> 13:08.799
that just tried to pick me up.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.200
Oh. Hi.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.200
Hi.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.400
- Again.
- Yeah.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.900
Yeah.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.200
I got to go.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.900
Nice to meet you.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.200
Tits and teeth.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.300
I don't think she was into me.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.700
Say, uh, ladies-

13:30.800 --> 13:31.900
Hey, you.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.400
Hey.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.100
- You look great.
- Thank you.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.700
So do you.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.100
So, how are you and Carol doing?

13:40.300 --> 13:41.400
We're-

13:43.400 --> 13:47.200
We're just giving each other
a little space right now.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.600
I worry about you
sometimes, Chuck.

13:49.700 --> 13:52.300
Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.100
It's better
to have loved and lost

13:54.200 --> 13:55.900
than to have never loved at all.

13:56.100 --> 14:00.200
I'll buy that when you can honestly
tell me that you have loved.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.500
Touché.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.600
I just want to see you
happy, Chuckles.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.000
Attention, hot mamas.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.800
Can we have all
the single ladies

14:11.900 --> 14:14.700
out on the terrace
for the tossing of the bride's bouquet?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.000
See you.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.100
Ready, ladies?

14:25.200 --> 14:27.800
One!

14:27.900 --> 14:30.100
Two!

14:30.200 --> 14:31.700
Three!

14:51.700 --> 14:52.600
Morning, Reba.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.300
Good morning, Dr. Logan.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.300
Good morning, Doctor.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.300
I think I have a cavity.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.800
Me, too.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.800
- Hey, Sharon. Is Stu in?
- Hi.

15:38.900 --> 15:41.300
Sharon-
Oh, Dr. Logan.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.500
Can you come back here
for a second, please?

15:50.300 --> 15:51.600
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We need you.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.800
Dr. Logan-

15:57.400 --> 15:59.000
This is Pleasure.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.300
Nice to meet you.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.200
The pleasure's all mine.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.900
Get it?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.700
"The pleasure's all mine"?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.800
My name is Pleasure.

16:07.900 --> 16:12.500
That is... enormously clever.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.500
We need a second opinion.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.900
What do you think?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.400
Are they even?

16:20.500 --> 16:21.600
So you knew they were even.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.100
Of course they were even. I did them.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.500
I just wanted you to see them

16:24.600 --> 16:26.300
without having to pay
for a lap dance.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.400
How did you get a license
to practice medicine?

16:28.500 --> 16:29.800
You need a license?

16:29.900 --> 16:33.500
Listen, have you noticed
anything different about me?

16:33.600 --> 16:37.000
Other than your aversion
to fantastic, gigantic titties?

16:37.100 --> 16:39.900
Women seem to be coming on to me

16:40.000 --> 16:41.900
in an unusual manner.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.400
Really?

16:52.100 --> 16:54.100
That's crazy.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.300
Charlie! Stuart.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.600
Carol.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.100
Are these back in season again?

17:02.400 --> 17:04.300
You're getting married.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.700
What can I say?

17:06.800 --> 17:08.900
I guess you are a lucky charm.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.200
You have 14 new messages.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.400
Message 1.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.700
Hey, Charlie.
My name's Nicole Adams.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.900
You don't know me,

17:33.000 --> 17:34.900
but I got your number
from Amy in Radiology.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
I was wondering
if we could meet up

17:37.100 --> 17:38.340
for drinks one of these nights.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.000
Hi, Charlie.
My name's Julia.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.800
I normally don't do this, but
I'm desperate. Could you-

17:43.900 --> 17:46.399
I'm not sure how you
choose your dates,

17:46.400 --> 17:47.800
but I'm 5'10", blonde-

17:49.000 --> 17:50.400
Hello, Charlie.
My name is Daisy.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.000
Uh, actually in town-

17:53.100 --> 17:54.300
Hi. My name is Bob.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.500
No, it's not a wrong number.
Hear me out.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.500
Hi. This is Cindy.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.800
I'm a friend of Katie's-

18:00.900 --> 18:01.900
Hey, my name's Colleen-

18:02.900 --> 18:04.300
Hey, there.
We met at the gym.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.400
StairMaster buddies?

18:10.200 --> 18:12.100
Eat up, Shadow.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.800
Last chance before bedtime.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.900
Good boy.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.500
Grumpy, don't be a pig.

18:19.600 --> 18:23.000
Don't be a pig.
That's Chester's.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.500
There you go.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.900
Good boy.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.300
Here, Dougie.
Gobble it up.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.300
Come here, Tina.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.700
Grumpy, you're such a pig.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.800
Joe, hurry up!

18:37.900 --> 18:39.500
I want to go home.

18:43.300 --> 18:45.000
Did you get lost back there?

18:45.100 --> 18:46.200
Sorry.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.600
Just taking five...

18:48.500 --> 18:50.700
hits from my bong.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.200
If they catch you with weed,
you're going to get fired.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.820
They don't care
that you're my brother.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.300
Oh, take a chillaxitive.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.000
How is anybody going to know?

18:59.100 --> 19:01.700
Maybe 'cause you smell like you've been
bathing in bong water.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.400
Sweet.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.600
What's that in your pocket?

19:09.400 --> 19:11.600
Oh, I was looking for this.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.100
Three months.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.000
Hey, Skully.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.800
Joe!
Joe, I'm slipping!

19:29.400 --> 19:31.500
And you think I look wasted.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.400
Grumpy, no!

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
You okay?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.600
I think I chipped a tooth.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.400
It's great to finally meet you.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.500
Let me get that for you.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.100
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.000
- All right?
- Yeah.

20:10.700 --> 20:11.900
All right.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.900
Are you ready?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.400
Yeah, let's go.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.400
Don't you want to, uh-

20:21.500 --> 20:22.600
What?

20:24.800 --> 20:26.100
I don't know, have dinner first?

20:26.200 --> 20:28.000
Is that how this works?

20:28.100 --> 20:30.300
How what works?

20:30.400 --> 20:31.300
The thing.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.000
The thing. The magic.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.300
The charm.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.800
Wait a second.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.400
Gretel, what the hell
are you talking about?

20:41.600 --> 20:43.700
You're a lucky charm.
You have sex with someone,

20:43.800 --> 20:45.600
and then they find
their true love.

20:45.700 --> 20:46.900
Isn't that how it works?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.099
Has everybody lost their minds?

20:48.100 --> 20:49.200
That's ridiculous.
That's absurd.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.700
Do you want top or bottom?

20:51.800 --> 20:53.700
Put that back
in your secret booby place.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.800
That's-No.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.000
I don't want to take
advantage of you.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.000
Look, don't take this
so seriously.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.200
I'm certainly not.

21:05.300 --> 21:07.000
I'm doing this on a lark.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.600
And you won't be
taking advantage of me.

21:09.700 --> 21:12.700
Do you know how many
loser boyfriends I have had?

21:12.800 --> 21:15.400
Do you know how many times
I have given myself-

21:15.500 --> 21:17.000
body, mind, soul-

21:17.300 --> 21:19.400
hoping that this was it,
this was the one,

21:19.500 --> 21:24.100
only to find out he was
just another asshole?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.000
Look, if there's a chance-

21:26.100 --> 21:31.100
I mean even a. 0001 %%% chance
that you're the key,

21:31.200 --> 21:35.000
that being with you could
open the door to something better,

21:35.100 --> 21:40.000
well, I think I'd be
taking advantage of you.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.100
Do you want to have sex
before or after dinner?

21:45.200 --> 21:47.700
Actually, I have dinner plans.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.300
I got to get that.
It's my emergency line.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.300
Oh. Emergency.
Now, that's sexy.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.500
Dr. Logan speaking.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.700
Hey, it's Cam Wexler.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.800
Remember, from the wedding?

21:59.900 --> 22:01.800
The serial killer?

22:05.900 --> 22:07.400
Yeah. Yeah, hi.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.700
I'm sorry to bother you,

22:08.800 --> 22:11.400
but I have a bit
of a dental emergency.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.400
You don't have to make up stories, Cam.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.600
If you want to see me,
all you have to do is ask.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.400
No, seriously.
I chipped a tooth,

22:18.500 --> 22:19.500
and it's Saturday night,

22:19.501 --> 22:21.800
and I don't know
who else to call.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.400
Oh, you chipped a tooth?
How?

22:23.500 --> 22:25.500
I slipped while having
a fish fight,

22:25.600 --> 22:26.800
slid down an ice ramp,

22:26.900 --> 22:28.200
got tackled by a penguin,

22:28.300 --> 22:30.600
and fell face-first
into a fake ice boulder.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.700
This is very common.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.500
Do you know where my office is?

22:34.600 --> 22:36.900
Yeah. I got your card
right here.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.700
I can be there in 20 minutes?

22:38.800 --> 22:40.900
20 minutes.
I'm leaving now.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.300
Okay.

22:55.300 --> 22:57.100
Okay, all fixed.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.600
Does that hurt?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.300
Can you describe the penguin
that attacked you?

23:02.400 --> 23:03.700
Very funny.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.900
You can rinse.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.600
So what really happened?

23:09.700 --> 23:11.200
Did you get caught in the middle

23:11.300 --> 23:13.100
of some North Pole-
South Pole gang war?

23:13.200 --> 23:15.300
There are no penguins
in the North Pole.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.600
That's polar bears.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.800
You really are
a penguin freak, aren't you?

23:18.900 --> 23:20.500
Oh, you have no idea.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.600
Obsessed is putting it mildly.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.600
I believe you.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.500
Oh, what's that?

23:26.600 --> 23:30.000
Oh, I travel
to Guatemala every year

23:30.100 --> 23:31.800
to help some
of the poorer villagers.

23:32.900 --> 23:35.000
That's so sweet.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Sorry!

23:39.100 --> 23:40.700
Oh! Oh, no!
They went in!

23:40.800 --> 23:41.700
They're in there!

23:41.800 --> 23:43.100
- What's in there?
- The things!

23:43.200 --> 23:44.700
Oh, here.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.100
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.600
This is bad.

23:49.700 --> 23:50.800
- You're hurt.
- It's okay.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.199
I'm so sorry.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.600
Should have worn that lead vest.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.800
Oh, this always happens to me.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.100
Are you okay?

23:58.200 --> 23:59.300
Yes.
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.800
- You sure?
- I feel good.

24:00.900 --> 24:04.700
Man. I hope you let me
buy you a new shirt.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.500
No. No, really.
It's, uh, it's good.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.300
But I hope you'll let me
take you out to dinner...

24:11.000 --> 24:12.400
sometime.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.700
Trust me, you can do
far more damage with a steak knife.

24:14.800 --> 24:18.000
I'm sorry.
I-I can't.

24:18.100 --> 24:20.200
How much do I owe you
for the tooth?

24:20.300 --> 24:22.500
Wait a second.
So you will draw first blood,

24:22.600 --> 24:25.500
but you won't make it up to me?

24:25.600 --> 24:28.200
Please, how much?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.300
No.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.900
Your money's no good here.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.000
You sure?

24:33.300 --> 24:34.400
I will not accept that.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.500
Really?

24:36.700 --> 24:37.600
Thank you.

24:37.700 --> 24:38.700
Yes.

24:39.900 --> 24:41.400
- I'm sorry.
- No.

24:43.100 --> 24:45.500
See you in six months
for a routine stabbing.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.200
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.100
Change your mind?

25:05.200 --> 25:06.700
My car won't start.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.700
Sure it won't.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.500
No, really.
I left my lights on.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.000
Fine.
I'm pushing the car.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.300
No, no, no, wait.
I want to jump you.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.400
Now?

25:26.500 --> 25:29.100
Not now.
Wait till I get this in here.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.300
Now?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.100
Oh!

25:37.100 --> 25:38.300
You okay?

25:38.400 --> 25:39.400
Yep.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.500
Let's-

25:40.600 --> 25:41.700
I'm so sorry.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.300
No, no. It's fine.
It's good.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.100
Cauterized my wounds.

25:47.700 --> 25:48.700
Thank you.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.500
Thank you for fixing my tooth

25:51.600 --> 25:52.800
and jumping my car.

25:52.900 --> 25:54.200
Don't mention it.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.500
And thank you for taking me home

26:01.600 --> 26:03.600
to get my spare set of keys.

26:09.500 --> 26:12.900
I have a feeling
this kind of thing happens to you often.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.600
My brother calls me Murphy.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.600
Murphy?

26:16.700 --> 26:18.600
You know, like, Murphy's Law:

26:18.700 --> 26:20.500
anything that can
go wrong, will.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.000
Details.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.800
Check out the thumb.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.200
Holy crap!

26:26.300 --> 26:28.300
What, did you get
pissed off at a stamp?

26:29.500 --> 26:31.400
How many bones have you broken?

26:31.500 --> 26:33.800
- 12.
- 12 bones?

26:33.900 --> 26:36.500
I'm warning you,
keep a safe distance.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.200
Come on. I can't believe
it's really that bad.

26:40.300 --> 26:41.300
Is this the heat?

26:41.400 --> 26:42.400
No!

26:46.200 --> 26:47.700
Convertible top.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.800
Oops.

26:53.800 --> 26:54.899
Keep the meter running.

26:54.900 --> 26:55.800
All right.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.300
Oh, shit!

26:57.400 --> 26:59.900
Shit! Shit! Shit!

27:00.000 --> 27:01.400
Pardon my French.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.700
I speak a little French,
and that sounded like "shit."

27:04.800 --> 27:06.900
I left my house key
on the car ring-

27:07.000 --> 27:08.300
You know what?
Doesn't matter.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.100
Got it!

27:35.200 --> 27:36.200
- Sorry.
- You all right?

27:36.300 --> 27:37.800
Yeah.

27:37.900 --> 27:39.700
- Hope these are the right keys.
- Yeah.

27:53.800 --> 27:54.900
Thank you.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.100
I'm sorry about the top,

27:57.200 --> 27:59.600
and the, uh,
nerve damage in the back,

27:59.700 --> 28:02.700
and the whole
electrocution thing, and-

28:02.900 --> 28:05.600
I'd still like
to pay for the tooth.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.900
I told you.
Buy me dinner.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.800
Lunch.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.500
Vending machine.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.500
Drinks. Water.
I'm easy.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.500
I'm just...

28:24.600 --> 28:27.199
not emotionally available
at this time.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.700
I'm okay with that.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.100
I'm looking for more of
a physical relationship anyway.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.500
So I've heard.

28:34.600 --> 28:35.800
I was kidding.

28:35.900 --> 28:38.500
That was a joke.
That was a stupid joke.

28:38.600 --> 28:42.000
Okay. I-I get it.

28:42.100 --> 28:43.400
So no way, then.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.800
I'm sorry.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.900
Good night, Dr. Logan.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.500
Thank you.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.800
I, uh...

29:02.900 --> 29:04.800
Yeah.

29:46.300 --> 29:47.400
Hi, Dr. Charlie.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.700
Reba! What the hell
are you doing here?

29:49.800 --> 29:51.000
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

29:51.100 --> 29:53.500
I used the key you left me
in case of emergencies.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.800
What's the emergency?

29:55.900 --> 29:58.500
I know about the charm.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.400
Not you, too.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.700
Somebody posted about you

30:01.800 --> 30:03.400
on perfectmatch. com

30:03.500 --> 30:05.100
It's an internet dating site.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.600
Yeah, I know what it is.

30:06.700 --> 30:07.900
This is out of control.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.400
These stories
are just coincidence.

30:09.500 --> 30:10.900
That's what I thought.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.800
But then I went
to urbanlegends. com,

30:13.900 --> 30:15.200
and nobody's disproved it.

30:15.300 --> 30:18.100
Reba, I'll see you at work on Monday.
Good night.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.000
Dr. Logan, you've always
been there for me.

30:20.100 --> 30:21.800
When you need a day off, yes.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.600
When you need a lift home, yes.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.600
When Reggie died four years ago,

30:25.700 --> 30:27.300
you sent that beautiful card.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.800
Do you remember what you wrote?

30:28.900 --> 30:32.300
"If there's anything I can do,
please let me know."

30:32.400 --> 30:33.300
Yeah, but, uh-

30:33.400 --> 30:35.900
Well, I'm letting you know.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.400
That's not what I had in mind.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.800
These panties are edible,

30:40.900 --> 30:42.500
but I'd avoid the tush area

30:42.600 --> 30:45.000
as I've been sitting
for about three hours.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.800
Reba, I'm not the guy for you.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.100
I'm not saying you are.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.500
But the next guy might be.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.100
Dr. Charlie, if we're together,

30:52.200 --> 30:53.900
I know I'll find my soul mate.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.800
That-That's ridiculous.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.400
No.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.300
No, Reba. Don't cry.
It's okay.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.000
Come on, Dr. Charlie.

31:04.100 --> 31:06.100
You got to do this for me.
Please.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.200
- Reba!
- Charlie-

31:11.000 --> 31:12.600
I can't do this.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.200
Don't worry.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.300
I'll do everything.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.500
Please.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.200
Just close your eyes

31:20.300 --> 31:23.600
and imagine somebody beautiful.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.300
I'll imagine you.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.000
No one but you.

31:43.900 --> 31:44.700
Reba?

31:44.900 --> 31:46.400
You slept with Reba?

31:46.600 --> 31:47.900
Shut up.

31:48.000 --> 31:48.900
You shut up.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.700
What the hell's
the matter with you?

31:50.800 --> 31:52.700
You're telling me
that you have the power

31:52.800 --> 31:54.400
to turn any hot chick
out there-

31:54.500 --> 31:55.800
any hot chick-

31:55.900 --> 31:59.700
into a knob-gobbling,
lance-waxing flesh monger,

31:59.800 --> 32:02.500
and you're out there
plowing the back 40 with Reba!

32:02.600 --> 32:05.100
You don't know
because you weren't there.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.600
Thank God I wasn't there.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.800
It's disgusting.
It's revolting.

32:08.900 --> 32:10.100
You're nasty.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.200
How was she?

32:13.200 --> 32:14.700
Dude, check it.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.500
You see, that is
the kind of tail you should be chasing.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.700
I could suck a fart
out of her ass

32:19.800 --> 32:21.000
and hold it like a bong hit.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.700
Nice stop, kid.
Way to be.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.100
Dude, these chicks,

32:32.200 --> 32:34.400
they think that you're,
like, a lucky charm, man.

32:34.500 --> 32:35.900
I mean, you poke the poon,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.600
she marries the next guy
she dates after you.

32:38.700 --> 32:39.900
It's not true.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.200
Who cares if it's true?

32:41.300 --> 32:42.900
Wake up, man.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.600
You got it made.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.900
What is it that all women want?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.500
To get married,

32:49.600 --> 32:51.600
raise crib midgets,

32:51.800 --> 32:53.300
and apparently, buddy,

32:53.500 --> 32:55.800
you got the ticket
to the big show.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.400
Do you know what this means?

32:57.600 --> 32:59.000
Trim.

32:59.100 --> 33:01.900
You're going to be seeing
trim like Tommy Lee,

33:02.000 --> 33:03.399
like Colin Farrell,

33:03.400 --> 33:05.500
like Ellen DeGeneres-
just-

33:08.500 --> 33:10.600
Have you considered
the possibility the reason

33:10.700 --> 33:12.260
you haven't been laid
in the last decade

33:12.300 --> 33:14.900
has something to do with
your routine use of the word "trim"?

33:15.000 --> 33:16.100
Yeah!

33:16.200 --> 33:18.900
Seven days a week, 56 weeks a year, trim!

33:21.900 --> 33:23.000
That's my bad.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.400
Where's your manners, shithead?

33:25.600 --> 33:27.000
What did you say to me?

33:29.100 --> 33:30.200
Little help here, honey?

33:34.600 --> 33:36.500
Look, you and I are different, okay?

33:36.600 --> 33:38.500
Besides the fact
that I'm not retarded,

33:38.600 --> 33:40.400
I don't want to take advantage.

33:40.500 --> 33:41.600
- Dude.
- Yeah.

33:41.700 --> 33:44.200
Was Martin Luther King,
Jr. taking advantage

33:44.300 --> 33:46.500
when he said that thing
in that place?

33:46.600 --> 33:48.200
I don't think so.

33:48.300 --> 33:52.300
Was Gandhi taking advantage
when he was doing his thing?

33:52.400 --> 33:53.700
No.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.700
And don't tell me
that Gandhi didn't score

33:55.800 --> 33:57.700
some sweet-ass
Native American trim.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.500
Gandhi was Indian.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.600
They don't like
to be called that.

34:01.700 --> 34:04.700
Dude, I thought
you wanted to feel love.

34:04.800 --> 34:05.800
I do.

34:05.900 --> 34:09.600
So stop dipping your foot in the pool
and dive the fuck in!

34:09.699 --> 34:11.600
And think about this, man.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.900
You'd be providing
a much-needed public service.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.199
You'd be helping women find love.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.600
Now, don't come bitching to me

34:18.699 --> 34:20.100
you haven't found Miss Right yet

34:20.199 --> 34:22.400
if you got women lining up
for the position

34:22.500 --> 34:24.699
and you're turning
your back on them.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.300
Nice.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.000
I guess.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.099
If I did it for the right reasons.

34:35.100 --> 34:38.600
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, biznatch.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.300
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa.
Don't take off my top.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.400
Something wrong?

35:15.500 --> 35:17.300
They're for the baby.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.100
You have a baby?

35:19.200 --> 35:22.000
No, but I will someday.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.500
It's really good.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
Fuck me.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.600
Fuck me harder.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.600
Oh.
Yeah.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.100
Fuck me!

35:41.200 --> 35:43.000
- Fuck me!
- I'm fucking!

35:43.100 --> 35:45.800
Fuck me, you cocksucking,
cum-guzzling shithead!

35:45.900 --> 35:47.100
Split my pussy in two!

35:47.200 --> 35:49.400
You motherfucking asshole!

35:53.500 --> 35:54.800
Is something wrong?

36:31.900 --> 36:33.300
Oh, God.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.400
Oh, God!

36:36.100 --> 36:40.600
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus Christ, almighty!

36:40.700 --> 36:43.100
God, my savior!

36:43.200 --> 36:47.500
I shall adore thee from now
until forever more!

36:47.700 --> 36:50.000
Oh! Amen!

36:51.200 --> 36:53.600
Would you like to
pray with me now?

36:54.800 --> 36:56.800
Uh... no.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.200
Yeah, I don't do that with men.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.100
Oh, yeah.
That's it.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.000
That's it!

37:35.100 --> 37:37.100
That's definitely it!

37:37.200 --> 37:38.799
That'll be my wedding dress.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.400
What do you think?

37:57.800 --> 37:59.700
Megan, I swear I know you
from some place.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.500
We went to high school together.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.300
Megan...

38:05.400 --> 38:07.100
What's your last name?

38:07.200 --> 38:08.300
Gilles.

38:08.400 --> 38:11.600
Gilles.
I knew a Matthew Gilles.

38:11.800 --> 38:14.200
God, you do look like him.
Is that your brother?

38:14.300 --> 38:17.200
Actually, that was me
before the operation.

38:33.300 --> 38:34.600
Thanks.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.700
You're welcome.

38:41.900 --> 38:44.100
- This just isn't working for me.
- Yeah, right.

38:44.300 --> 38:46.100
You're just gonna give up
boning all these women?

38:46.200 --> 38:48.200
These girls don't want
to be with me.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.100
They want to be
with the next guy.

38:50.200 --> 38:53.500
So what? The road
to the next guy leads through you.

38:53.600 --> 38:56.200
It's not that satisfying.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.100
I'll tell you not satisfying.

38:58.300 --> 39:01.000
Last night I masturbated
into a grapefruit.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.200
I put it in the microwave.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.000
I heated it up
a little bit, which helped,

39:06.100 --> 39:07.000
but...

39:07.100 --> 39:09.600
still.

39:16.500 --> 39:20.400
You know, I read somewhere
that penguins like to eat their own shit.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.600
You have 108 messages.

39:34.700 --> 39:36.600
Messages deleted.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.400
The female lays a single egg

39:53.600 --> 39:55.400
and rolls it onto
the feet of the male.

39:55.500 --> 39:58.200
The male stands
and incubates the egg

39:58.300 --> 40:01.200
until it hatches, about 65 days.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.700
Having built up
a thick layer of fat

40:03.900 --> 40:05.800
to sustain him
through the long winter,

40:05.900 --> 40:08.500
he never leaves the egg
to hunt for food.

40:08.700 --> 40:12.300
The female returns just
before the chick hatches.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.200
If you have any questions,
please feel free to ask.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.900
What are you doing here?

40:27.000 --> 40:28.800
Are you telling me
that the male penguin

40:28.900 --> 40:30.900
really lives off
his own fat for 65 days

40:31.000 --> 40:32.600
while he's protecting the egg?

40:32.700 --> 40:34.700
You think that the female could bring him,
like, a mackerel burger?

40:34.800 --> 40:38.500
Seriously, why are you here?

40:38.600 --> 40:40.000
Look, I don't buy the whole

40:40.100 --> 40:42.299
"I'm not emotionally available" thing.

40:42.300 --> 40:43.300
Are you dying?

40:43.500 --> 40:44.900
Is that why you don't want
to get involved with me?

40:45.000 --> 40:46.800
Because you don't wanna
hurt me when you die?

40:46.900 --> 40:48.000
No, I'm not dying.

40:48.100 --> 40:50.800
Well, I'm not dying either,
so what is it, then?

40:50.900 --> 40:52.900
Am I not your type?
I can take it if it's that.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.700
I think you should go.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.000
No, I think I should stay,

40:57.100 --> 40:59.900
because I paid $38.00
to see you today.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.100
And I'm not leaving
until you pay me my money back.

41:02.200 --> 41:03.500
Is this the dude?

41:03.600 --> 41:05.400
- No. Joe!
- Have you been talking about me?

41:05.500 --> 41:07.000
Why aren't you wearing your shirt?

41:07.100 --> 41:08.500
- Has she been talking about me?
- Yeah.

41:08.600 --> 41:09.800
- No!
- You're the dentist.

41:09.900 --> 41:11.800
I am the dude!

41:12.000 --> 41:14.200
No, I mentioned you in passing.

41:14.300 --> 41:15.800
I said you were funny.

41:15.900 --> 41:17.500
- Oh.
- And you said he was-

41:17.600 --> 41:20.600
And I said you were
charming and...

41:20.700 --> 41:22.500
good-looking, and...

41:22.600 --> 41:23.600
you have a nice smile.

41:23.700 --> 41:25.700
Oh, I would not go out with me, either.

41:27.700 --> 41:30.400
Excuse me, miss?
How come the mommy penguin

41:30.500 --> 41:32.800
doesn't bring back food
for the daddy penguin?

41:33.000 --> 41:35.500
'Cause the daddy penguin
doesn't need any food, sweetie.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.100
I have another question.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.700
Why won't you go out with Charlie?

41:45.300 --> 41:47.900
- She'd love to.
- Joe! You're my brother!

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Why are you taking his side?

41:50.100 --> 41:52.100
Because I know
how long it's been-

41:53.300 --> 41:55.100
Another word, I hide your stash.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.000
Go put a shirt on.

42:00.700 --> 42:01.900
Look, how about this.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.600
Why don't you eat,

42:03.700 --> 42:06.100
and I'll just digest my own lard.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.600
Look...

42:09.700 --> 42:11.300
I just...

42:11.400 --> 42:13.699
I know three women
you've gone out with.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.800
I'm just not into dating
as a sport.

42:18.700 --> 42:20.600
Wait, you said if anybody
had any questions-

42:20.700 --> 42:22.600
- No! I'm not going out with you!
- That's not my question.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.900
That was the little girl's question.
I have a new question.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.200
What is that penguin
right there?

42:30.600 --> 42:33.000
That's a Gentoo,
one of several species

42:33.100 --> 42:35.900
of penguin that is
completely monogamous.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.600
I hope that answers
your question.

42:37.700 --> 42:39.400
Oh, and penguins are unique

42:39.500 --> 42:42.600
in that mate selection
is up to the female.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.900
Much like our relationship.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Why do you wanna take me
to dinner so badly?

42:47.100 --> 42:48.300
You look hungry.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.600
Seriously.

42:51.100 --> 42:52.300
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.200
Because you remind me
of these penguins.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.300
Yes, they're kind of
awkward and goofy.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.800
Yet in the water,
they're so beautiful.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.200
Okay.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.500
Okay, what?

43:15.600 --> 43:17.600
- Okay, dinner.
- Will you put that in writing?

43:17.700 --> 43:19.700
Don't push it.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.900
But only as friends...

43:22.000 --> 43:24.400
because if you must know,
there is someone else.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.500
His name is Howard Blaine.

43:28.700 --> 43:30.600
He is a foremost expert on penguins,

43:30.700 --> 43:33.600
and I'm meeting him
later this year at a conference.

43:33.700 --> 43:35.500
I'm interested in him.

43:35.600 --> 43:36.800
Well, I'm interested
in choreographing

43:36.900 --> 43:39.400
a wacky line dance
that sweeps the nation,

43:39.500 --> 43:42.100
but we both know
that's never gonna happen.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.200
One date as friends.

43:44.300 --> 43:46.199
Fine.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.600
Bye.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.800
I'm okay.
Just-

43:50.900 --> 43:52.300
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

43:54.900 --> 43:56.100
Bye.

44:13.300 --> 44:15.800
So do sharks get cavities?

44:15.900 --> 44:17.000
No.

44:17.100 --> 44:19.000
- You have no idea, do you.
- I don't know.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.600
I thought we were gonna
ask each other personal questions.

44:22.700 --> 44:24.700
Isn't that the point
of 100 Questions?

44:24.800 --> 44:26.100
Is that your question?

44:26.200 --> 44:29.500
No, my question is...

44:29.600 --> 44:32.000
Why penguins? Why?

44:32.100 --> 44:33.300
Why teeth?

44:33.400 --> 44:34.520
Same as every other dentist.

44:34.600 --> 44:35.760
Couldn't get into med school.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.400
That's funny.

44:37.500 --> 44:39.600
My parents didn't think so.

44:39.700 --> 44:41.900
So really, why penguins?

44:42.000 --> 44:43.400
Couldn't get into shark school.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I don't know, lots of reasons.

44:48.100 --> 44:50.400
For one, you can't help but smile
when you see a penguin.

44:50.500 --> 44:54.000
Yeah, plus they have that bad-ass tuxedo
embedded in their flesh.

44:54.100 --> 44:55.400
I know! They're just so cute.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.000
I just-
I just love 'em so much.

44:57.200 --> 44:59.900
I just love, love, love 'em!

45:00.000 --> 45:02.700
I even go to Antarctica
for research.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.700
Oh, it's so beautiful there.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.500
You know they have
once-a-year sunsets?

45:07.700 --> 45:09.700
You haven't seen beauty
until you've seen that.

45:09.800 --> 45:11.800
Oh, I don't know about that.

45:14.800 --> 45:17.799
And the penguin rituals
are just fascinating.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.300
Okay now, by rituals,
do you mean, like,

45:20.400 --> 45:21.900
eating their own poop?

45:22.000 --> 45:23.400
No.

45:23.500 --> 45:25.500
Like when a male
is sweet on a female,

45:25.600 --> 45:27.000
he searches the entire beach

45:27.100 --> 45:29.600
to find the perfect pebble
to present to her.

45:29.700 --> 45:31.200
When he finally finds it,

45:31.300 --> 45:32.700
he waddles over

45:32.800 --> 45:35.600
and presents the stone
by placing it at her feet.

45:35.700 --> 45:38.200
If she accepts,
they'll be life-long mates.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.000
It's kind of like
an engagement ring.

45:40.200 --> 45:42.700
Yeah, it's unbelievable to watch.

45:47.300 --> 45:48.900
I have a feeling

45:49.000 --> 45:50.900
that you are a very good kisser.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.300
And I know this because I spent
an hour and a half inside your mouth,

45:54.400 --> 45:55.900
and I scoped it out.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.300
What makes you think
I'll be kissing you, huh?

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
You all right?

46:03.600 --> 46:05.200
You okay?

46:25.800 --> 46:28.100
I guess I was wrong about
the "really good kisser" thing.

46:30.300 --> 46:31.800
Come on, we'll find
something you're good at.

46:31.900 --> 46:33.000
What!

46:35.500 --> 46:38.200
Perfectly imperfect?
What the hell does that mean?

46:38.400 --> 46:39.600
I don't know.

46:39.700 --> 46:42.700
I mean, haven't you ever
fallen for someone's flaws?

46:42.800 --> 46:44.100
I'm a plastic surgeon.

46:44.300 --> 46:47.200
I see a flaw,
I pour spackle over it.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.099
Hey, are these new?

46:49.100 --> 46:50.600
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, no!

46:50.700 --> 46:54.300
No, you don't touch these.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.600
It's Pamela Anderson's
breast implants.

46:56.700 --> 46:58.700
Why are they not implanted
in her breasts?

46:58.800 --> 47:01.500
It's a reduction, baby.
This is what came out.

47:01.600 --> 47:04.000
So you're hoping that
some sick dude will buy these?

47:04.100 --> 47:06.500
Some sick dude already did.

47:06.600 --> 47:08.100
This dude!

47:08.200 --> 47:10.720
What the hell do you want
Pamela Anderson's breast fillings for?

47:10.800 --> 47:12.520
Why the hell do you want
Miss Penguin Pussy?

47:12.600 --> 47:14.500
To each his own, buddy.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.800
Oh, Miss Penguin Pussy.
Who the fuck are you?

47:16.900 --> 47:19.700
Stu Klaminsky.
Nice to meet you.

47:19.800 --> 47:23.000
Anyway, Cam's the one, man.

47:23.100 --> 47:25.500
When I'm with her,
I don't know, Stu.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.300
I mean, I feel like...

47:28.000 --> 47:29.700
She just-
She-

47:29.800 --> 47:31.100
Completes you.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.400
- Screw you.
- Screw you.

47:32.500 --> 47:33.700
And can I just say

47:33.800 --> 47:35.700
that I'm an idiot
for listening to you?

47:35.800 --> 47:36.700
Public service.

47:36.800 --> 47:37.700
May I remind you

47:37.800 --> 47:39.100
that you got your axle greased

47:39.200 --> 47:40.500
a fair amount in the process?

47:40.600 --> 47:43.100
What's sex without love?

47:44.100 --> 47:45.500
Sex!

47:45.600 --> 47:48.600
It's still sex!

47:48.700 --> 47:50.400
Jesus Christ.

47:50.500 --> 47:53.600
I never met a guy so bummed
to squirt a little baby gravy.

47:53.800 --> 47:54.900
Baby gravy?

47:55.000 --> 47:57.100
You know, man chowder.

48:00.600 --> 48:02.800
Can't believe you're going
cold turkey for this chick.

48:02.900 --> 48:04.700
If she wants me to be
more like a Gentoo,

48:04.800 --> 48:07.300
I'm going to be like a Gentoo.

48:07.400 --> 48:08.700
You lost me.

48:08.800 --> 48:11.300
Gentoo.
It's a monogamous penguin.

48:11.400 --> 48:15.900
Who's ridiculed
by the other penguins

48:16.000 --> 48:18.300
for being a fag.

48:20.400 --> 48:22.200
Here it comes!

48:30.000 --> 48:32.500
You got some-right there.

48:32.600 --> 48:33.800
Thanks.

48:33.900 --> 48:35.300
Do I have any on me?

48:35.400 --> 48:36.300
No, no.

48:36.400 --> 48:37.700
You want to get that?

48:39.000 --> 48:40.200
You're silly.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.900
I have something for you.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Really?

48:46.100 --> 48:47.500
A gift?

48:47.600 --> 48:49.200
Oh, bad form.

48:49.300 --> 48:50.700
A gift on the third date?

48:50.800 --> 48:52.000
Open it.

48:52.100 --> 48:53.500
Okay.

48:57.700 --> 48:59.800
You're an asshole.

48:59.900 --> 49:01.900
Yes, but a thoughtful asshole.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.500
Thank you.

49:06.200 --> 49:08.600
So, fess up about this charm.

49:09.700 --> 49:10.700
You heard about that.

49:10.800 --> 49:13.300
Yeah. It's quite a scam
you got going.

49:13.400 --> 49:14.900
- No, it's not me.
- Please.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.100
It's not.
I'm serious.

49:16.200 --> 49:17.900
Somebody somewhere
got it into their head

49:18.000 --> 49:19.600
that once a girl's been with me,

49:19.700 --> 49:20.800
she'll meet her true love

49:20.900 --> 49:22.800
with the next guy
she goes out with.

49:22.900 --> 49:23.900
Can you believe it?

49:24.000 --> 49:25.400
Please.

49:25.500 --> 49:28.100
People will believe
whatever they want to believe.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.600
Okay. I've got one for you.

49:43.700 --> 49:45.260
Did you know
it is physically impossible

49:45.300 --> 49:47.300
for a human being
to lick their own elbow?

49:47.400 --> 49:48.500
How do you know that?

49:48.600 --> 49:49.600
No one can do it.

49:49.700 --> 49:51.400
All right.
I can do it.

49:55.900 --> 49:57.700
Can't do it, my friend.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.000
All right, fine.

49:59.100 --> 50:00.200
I've got one.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.100
Did you know
that the average person

50:02.200 --> 50:04.400
produces 10,000 gallons of saliva
in their lifetime?

50:04.500 --> 50:08.300
Did you know that I produce
10,000 gallons of saliva in one kiss?

50:08.400 --> 50:09.400
That's disgusting.

50:09.500 --> 50:10.900
I'm going to show you.
Come here.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.400
I'm serious.
I'm serious about this.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.300
I don't like sloppy kisses.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.100
Are you trying to unhook my bra?

50:48.200 --> 50:51.700
No. No.
I wouldn't do that. No.

50:51.800 --> 50:54.100
Why not?
Am I not your type?

50:54.200 --> 50:56.200
You are definitely my type.

50:56.300 --> 50:57.400
What's your type?

50:57.500 --> 51:00.100
Black and blue,
riddled with bandages.

51:01.500 --> 51:04.400
And braless.
Yeah. Definitely braless.

51:20.300 --> 51:22.300
Your move.

51:27.900 --> 51:29.000
That's it?

51:29.100 --> 51:30.700
Socks are next.
Slow down.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.300
Wuss.

51:37.300 --> 51:38.700
You really want to do this?

51:38.800 --> 51:41.200
I mean, you really want
to take us further?

51:54.400 --> 51:56.300
This is not happening.

51:59.900 --> 52:01.500
I got to get it.

52:01.600 --> 52:03.500
It's-It's my emergency line.

52:03.600 --> 52:04.500
No. No.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.600
I got to get it.
I'll be back.

52:06.700 --> 52:07.800
I'll be fast.

52:11.700 --> 52:12.700
Dr. Logan speaking.

52:12.800 --> 52:14.500
Dude!

52:16.000 --> 52:17.900
Is this an emergency?

52:18.100 --> 52:19.700
You're going to want
to hear this, man.

52:19.800 --> 52:22.800
Well, I am rather busy
right now.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Good night!

52:24.200 --> 52:26.000
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Did you bone her yet?

52:26.100 --> 52:29.000
Look, unless
this is an emergency,

52:29.100 --> 52:31.200
call my office in the morning.

52:31.300 --> 52:33.600
Fine. You want
to lose her forever,

52:33.700 --> 52:35.400
you hang up the phone right now.

52:35.500 --> 52:38.400
This is going to be
the best night of your life.

52:38.500 --> 52:40.100
Are you still there?

52:40.200 --> 52:43.600
Chuck. Are you there?

52:43.700 --> 52:45.000
What are you talking about?

52:45.100 --> 52:47.400
Dude, it's that charm thing.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.900
It turns out it's real!

52:50.000 --> 52:53.800
No. That's not true
because you told me yourself-

52:53.900 --> 52:55.300
Uh-uh, but now I believe.

52:55.400 --> 52:57.299
I started calling all your exes.

52:57.300 --> 52:58.600
They're married.

52:58.700 --> 53:00.200
Not just some. All.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.500
A to Z on your Palm Pilot, man.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.300
Susan Agrezzi
to Jeannie Zeigert.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.700
Every single one
you closed the deal with.

53:06.800 --> 53:09.500
And did you see this month's
high school newsletter?

53:09.600 --> 53:10.900
Sarah McDowell.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.800
What, the girl
I lost my virginity to?

53:12.900 --> 53:14.600
Did you see who she
wound up marrying?

53:14.700 --> 53:18.200
Tony Lamberto, that douche bag
she dumped you for!

53:18.300 --> 53:21.300
You know what this means,
don't you?

53:21.400 --> 53:22.800
You shake the sheets with Cam,

53:23.000 --> 53:25.100
she's going to marry
the next guy she dates.

53:26.600 --> 53:29.200
This-This-

53:29.300 --> 53:30.600
I hate you.

53:30.700 --> 53:33.200
I really hate you!

53:37.200 --> 53:39.100
I got to go.
I got to go.

53:39.200 --> 53:40.900
A dental emergency.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.200
Freak accident.

53:43.300 --> 53:45.800
Children, they thought
it was gumballs.

53:45.900 --> 53:47.400
Ball bearings,

53:47.500 --> 53:50.000
and it just fucked up
their shit.

53:51.500 --> 53:53.400
You look great.
I had a good time.

53:53.500 --> 53:54.500
I got to go.

53:56.600 --> 53:57.600
I got to go!

54:00.300 --> 54:02.200
I can't believe you're
really considering doing this.

54:02.300 --> 54:04.400
If you believe it
and everyone else believes it,

54:04.500 --> 54:05.700
what else can I do?

54:05.800 --> 54:06.900
Anything but this.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.100
I got to be sure.

54:08.200 --> 54:10.200
I've got to put the curse to the test.

54:10.300 --> 54:12.200
Where is she?

54:12.300 --> 54:13.700
She's beached over there

54:13.800 --> 54:17.200
by the giant garbage bag
full of doughnut holes.

54:17.300 --> 54:19.500
Eleanor Skepple.

54:19.600 --> 54:23.400
She's angry, rude,
and she smells bad.

54:23.500 --> 54:25.100
In addition to back acne,

54:25.200 --> 54:29.399
she's got front acne
and side acne.

54:29.400 --> 54:31.500
You see that glass of water there?

54:31.600 --> 54:33.600
She keeps her teeth
in that glass.

54:33.700 --> 54:37.400
So you're saying
that she's single.

54:37.500 --> 54:38.900
She's your best bet, man.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.700
You sink the soldier all you want.

54:40.800 --> 54:42.100
This chick ain't never
getting married.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.400
If she was the last woman
on the face of the earth,

54:44.500 --> 54:47.400
humanity would come
to a screeching halt.

55:05.100 --> 55:08.600
Hey, asshole,
got my peanut butter?

55:08.700 --> 55:12.200
No. My name's Charlie.

55:16.900 --> 55:18.500
I'm sorry.
I was just wondering

55:18.600 --> 55:21.700
if, um-if I could
take you out tonight.

55:21.800 --> 55:24.500
How does that-
How does that sound?

55:27.600 --> 55:29.600
You want me to elaborate?

55:29.700 --> 55:31.600
No. I get your drift.

55:31.700 --> 55:33.300
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

55:40.100 --> 55:42.600
Pay you a hundred dollars
to go out with me tonight.

55:45.600 --> 55:46.800
$200.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.500
Make me happy.

55:58.900 --> 56:00.099
So a thousand dollars,

56:00.100 --> 56:02.700
and all you have to do
is take me to dinner?

56:04.200 --> 56:06.700
Well, actually, I thought
that maybe we could,

56:06.800 --> 56:09.900
you know, we-
you and I could, uh-

56:15.600 --> 56:16.900
get physical.

56:18.500 --> 56:20.800
All right.

56:20.900 --> 56:24.900
I'm gonna fuck you till you die!

56:43.300 --> 56:44.900
And now we wait.

56:48.800 --> 56:53.100
Oh, Coco, I know how you feel.

56:53.200 --> 56:55.200
We just put ourselves out there,

56:55.300 --> 56:56.400
and what happened?

56:56.500 --> 56:58.200
I'm left hanging.

56:58.300 --> 57:00.400
Huh, girl?

57:03.100 --> 57:04.900
Has he called yet?

57:05.000 --> 57:07.500
No, Joe, he hasn't.

57:07.600 --> 57:11.400
Thanks for asking.
I really appreciate it.

57:11.500 --> 57:13.900
God, I feel so stupid.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.300
Why did I act like that?

57:17.700 --> 57:19.200
Why hasn't he called?

57:19.300 --> 57:22.300
All this waiting
is driving me crazy.

57:22.400 --> 57:26.400
You know, there's always
some madness in love.

57:26.500 --> 57:32.200
But there's also always
some reason in madness.

57:33.500 --> 57:35.200
Nietzsche.

57:35.300 --> 57:37.300
Been using the pages
of this philosophy book

57:37.400 --> 57:38.500
for rolling paper.

57:38.600 --> 57:41.500
It's like I'm smoking
their thoughts.

57:48.500 --> 57:49.500
It's him.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.500
Well, get it.

57:51.700 --> 57:53.200
I'm gonna let it ring.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.000
I'll screen it.

57:58.100 --> 58:00.300
Sorry I haven't called,
but I've been really sick.

58:01.600 --> 58:03.300
I can't even get out of bed.

58:03.400 --> 58:06.100
Do you think maybe we could
just talk on the phone

58:06.200 --> 58:07.300
or on the computer?

58:09.100 --> 58:11.000
I'd really, really like that.

58:11.100 --> 58:12.500
Call me.

59:35.200 --> 59:36.600
I can't pretend
to be sick forever.

59:36.700 --> 59:37.820
Come on, man.
You're my hero.

59:37.900 --> 59:39.900
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you gotta do this for me.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.100
You got this, my brother.
You're a crazy train.

59:42.200 --> 59:43.800
You're the man in the mirror.

59:43.900 --> 59:45.600
You're a force of nature.
Hurricane Stu.

59:45.700 --> 59:46.600
I can't do it.

59:46.700 --> 59:47.900
You have to do it.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.400
No one's asked her out yet.

59:49.500 --> 59:52.000
Yeah, right. So I go out
with Eleanor Skepple

59:52.100 --> 59:53.100
to test your curse,

59:53.200 --> 59:54.400
and what happens next?

59:54.500 --> 59:56.200
I'm walking down the aisle
with Shamu!

59:56.300 --> 59:57.400
I don't think so.

59:57.500 --> 59:59.200
Do you see what I'm doing here?

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.800
The friend card, man?

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.900
Yeah.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
That's mean.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.100
You leave me no choice.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.600
Give me that,
you son of a bitch.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.500
If I marry her, Chuck,

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.900
we're going to hunt you down
and eat you.

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.400
Yeah, Stu.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500
I can't believe
you're still sick.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.000
How long has it been?

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.900
Two weeks. It's, uh...

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.300
it's killing me, but, you know,

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.800
I don't want to infect you.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.000
At this point, I wouldn't mind.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.900
You know, I feel
like a kid again.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.800
I haven't talked
on the phone this much

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.200
since I was in high school.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.600
That reminds me.

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.800
Would you go to the prom with me?

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.900
I love your voice.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.200
The crazy things is,
I can't picture you anymore.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.300
Okay, here's the update:

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.600
I am now 4' 3",

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:09.300
I weigh 235 pounds,
and I've got a cleft eye.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.000
Can I ask you something?

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.400
Yeah.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.800
Are you not into girls?

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.400
No.
No.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:27.300
Are you... seriously, are you there?

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.300
Yeah.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.900
I'm not... not into girls.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.900
You should have seen
my room growing up.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
It was full of posters of... of girls!

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.900
There was no guys.
It was girls!

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.200
Well, are you avoiding
actually seeing me?

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.800
No, Cam. I'm dying to see you.
It's killing me.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.900
Then come over.
Right now. Wash my back.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.100
Come on.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.400
I'll wear a mask.
You could wear a mask.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.500
We'll play doctor.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.100
Ooh, boy. I want to,

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.400
but with the-

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.100
No buts.
I need to see you.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.300
I need to see if that
birthmark you have

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.500
really looks like Alfred Hitchcock.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.400
Now, wait. No. That-

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.700
That is a restricted area, okay?

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.100
Not everybody gets a peek

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.599
at the Master of Suspense,

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.900
if you know what I'm saying.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.100
If I can't see you,

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.500
we should take
our phone relationship

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.700
to the next level.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.100
What do you mean?

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.900
Oh, yeah.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.700
That feels good.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.500
I like that.
Do you like that?

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.100
Like what?

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.500
That's my phone sex voice.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.900
Come on, Charlie,
work with me here.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.900
I want to. I just don't
think that we should do that.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.800
I mean, nothing to do with-

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.000
Does your phone
receive pictures?

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.200
Yeah, why?

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.200
Sending.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.400
Sending?

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.100
What are you sending to me?

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.800
Fuck!

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.000
- I got it.
- Got it?

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.600
I'm done for the night.
Thank you.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.100
Oh, God.
Hold on one second.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.200
Stu, what's up?

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.700
The deed is done.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.000
I went out with Eleanor Skepple.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.900
I'm not proposing to her,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.900
so you're in the clear.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.700
Are you there?

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.400
Chuck?

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.500
I feel better.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.100
Camcorder in the bedroom, huh?

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200
Kinky.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.100
So, for the, uh, camera,

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.800
do I have to sign a waiver
or something, you know,

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.000
for internet purposes?

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.900
You really want
to talk right now?

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.400
Whoa, those are nice.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.200
Oh, God bless you.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.200
You pushed me.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:27.900
Sorry.
It's been a while.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.400
I can see I'm going
to have to wear protection.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.800
Stop staring at me.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.200
You're creeping me out.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.500
No matter what your size.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.200
You will not go to waste.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.700
Sometimes it takes a little love

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.200
to make someone want
to shed the pounds.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:36.900
Two main reasons-

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.800
What the hell?

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.200
Hello.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.700
"The deed is done"?
The deed is done!

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.900
I thought you said

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.400
you went out
with Eleanor Skepple.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:05:59.900
No, man. I just said that.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.600
What?

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.100
I didn't want to risk it.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.500
Marrying her?
Are you stupid?

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.800
But I saw you, man.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.500
You asked her out.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.600
No, man. I asked her
what time it was.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.400
She said it was 3:53.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.060
I can't believe
that I trusted you, Stu.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.200
You fucked me!

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.400
Take out your friend card.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.100
What?

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.700
Take out your friend card now
and rip it up

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.000
because you fucked me, Stu.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.000
Oh, buddy, she's just a girl.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:30.300
No. It's not a girl.

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.200
It's the girl.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.900
Now I'm going to lose her.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.500
I'm not going to lose her.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.200
Breakfast in bed.

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:57.700
Wake up! Good morning!
It's a beautiful day!

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.200
Wow.

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.700
Am I supposed to eat
my way out of here?

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.400
I walked into the supermarket.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.800
I stood there. I was like,
"What does Cam want?"

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:06.900
And I couldn't stop.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I was like, "She'll want that
and that and that," and I got it all.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.300
They didn't have Spam, though.
I talked to the manager.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.300
They won't have it in until next week.
Anyway, enjoy.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.100
Are you okay?

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.600
I am fantastic.
I feel like-

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.200
I did this-

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.340
And then I gave myself
one of these. Look.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.100
And I made out with myself.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.300
You're acting kind of strange.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.900
No. No, no.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.800
Yeah, eat up. Eat up.
Try that. Try that.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.100
Eat up.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.400
Hey, um, what are your plans

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.000
for the rest of today?

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.500
I'm going to work.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.300
I'm going to go
to work with you!

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.600
I'm going to hang out.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.100
I got it all planned out.
I'm going to go.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.900
I'm kidding.
I'm not going to work with you.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.200
Actually, Saturday.

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.600
What are you plans for Saturday-Sunday?

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.600
What are your plans for Sunday?

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.000
Don't even answer that

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.500
because I'm already
thinking about Wednesday.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.760
What are you doing Wednesday?

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.500
Let's just seal it right now-
seal the deal-

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.100
and then I'll do my pineapple dance.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.900
Yes, Wednesday?

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.300
This is your fault!
Everything!

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:09.800
You!

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.699
Jesus Christ, why me?

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.500
Just shut your lips, Stu.
Shut up!

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:20.899
Hi, Cam. What's up?
It's Charlie.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.100
How are you doing today?

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.300
I just wanted to call

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.300
and make sure I had
the right number,

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.899
and I do, and I do.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.100
How are you doing?

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.600
Having a good day at work?

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.000
Well, I'll let you get back,
but I wanted to remind you,

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.200
Wednesday night,
you and me, happily.

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:38.700
All right.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.200
This is your fault!

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.700
His!

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.100
You already ate.
Why are you-

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.500
Is there something different
in here since lunch?

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:28.800
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, banana

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:31.600
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, banana

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.100
Got me lookin'
so crazy right now

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.100
Your love's got me
lookin' so crazy right now

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.600
Got me lookin'
so crazy right now

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.500
Your touch has got me
lookin' so crazy right now

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.299
Got me hopin'
you'd page me right now

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:48.300
Your kiss got me hopin'
you'd save me right now

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:50.899
Lookin' so crazy,
your love's got me lookin'

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.600
Got me lookin' so crazy,
your love

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.400
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, got it.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.700
Got me going,
so pay me right now

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.800
Raise the habitat.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.000
Crazy, crazy, crazy

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.300
Crazy for you

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.400
Changed my mind.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.000
Took the day off
so I could hang.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.400
I won't be in the way.

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.800
I know what you're thinking.
I'm going to be in the way.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.800
But I think I'm going to blend in
like this. I think I'll blend. Look.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.500
I know how to do that.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.900
Charlie, I'm working.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.400
Or I could go.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.900
Yeah, I-

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.900
Get out of here.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:40.900
No, no.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Thanks.

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.200
Have a great day at work.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.100
My car's this way.

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.400
Hi, Cam.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.400
Work is done.
Time for fun.

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.500
Hey.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.000
Listen, I know
an amazing sushi place,

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.400
and the best part of all:

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.800
when you're finished
with your leftovers,

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.100
they put them in a doggie bag-
or a penguin bag.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.800
- Charlie-
- Oh, you don't like sushi.

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:36.500
Uh, Thai? Indian.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.600
Listen to me, you need
to leave me alone, okay?

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:41.000
I need some space.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.800
So tonight is no good.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.900
I'm very close
to changing my phone number.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.800
Do you understand?

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.700
If you were a hamburger
at McDonald's,

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.100
I'd name you my
McBeautiful Tittie Sandwich

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.600
With Titties On Top.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.400
- Can I see Stu?
- Just a sec-

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:30.600
Yeah.

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:33.500
Stu, I need you.
It's important.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.800
I'm Dr. Charlie Logan.

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.500
I don't know who this Stu
is you speak of.

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:49.600
Call me.

01:12:49.601 --> 01:12:50.700
I need your help.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.700
Hey, are we still friends?

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.100
Cam is going to fall in love with
and get married

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.300
to the next guy she goes
on a date with, right?

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.500
I'm going to be that next guy.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.100
Yeah.
You're a plastic surgeon.

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:04.000
You're going to...
change my face up.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.200
I don't care if you
give me a beak.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.200
I'm going to look
like a different guy.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.500
That way,
when I meet her-

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.700
Hi. My name's Ronald-

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.900
I'm the new guy
she falls in love with.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.100
Let's go. Right now.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.400
Don't look at me
in that tone of voice.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.000
I'm talking the truth.
Please?

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.000
Chuck...

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.100
take a look around, man.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.000
I mean, I can give you tits.
You want tits?

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.900
So you're not going to help me.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.400
Yes, but not by
rearranging your face, man.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.200
Come here. Have a seat.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.880
There's got to be
a better way, right?

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.800
I mean, I know
things are bad now,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.900
but things could be
a lot worse, right?

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.600
Listen, you could be
like my cousin, man.

01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.200
He found out last week

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.100
he's got an inoperable
brain tumor.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:51.900
That's horrible.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.200
Yeah.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.100
He's only got, like,
one week left to live.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.800
That is...

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.700
perfect.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:04.000
That's perfect.
He's the perfect guy for her.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.100
What?

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.320
Yeah.
There's no harm, right?

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.100
He gets laid.
She falls in love.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.300
He's dead within a week.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.500
I swoop in, console her.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.700
Bing-bang-boom,
everybody's happy.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.900
Hey!

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.700
Why don't you club her
and have a wedding ceremony

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.600
while she's knocked unconscious?

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.900
That'd work!

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.899
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:25.400
You have to let her go.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:28.900
That's the one thing I can't do.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.200
- Next time I'll bring my suit.
- Yeah.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.600
Oh, no.

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.500
Oh, no. That's not good.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
No.

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:14.300
It's over.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.700
That has to be George.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.900
George.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.000
Hey, George!

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.700
- What's up, George?
- What?

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.100
- How you doing, George?
- I'm not George.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.600
You're going to stay
away from Cam, all right?

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:29.900
You're going to stay away
from Cam, you hear me?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.600
- You're George!
- Charlie!

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.200
- I'm not George!
- Cam!

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:35.400
What are you doing?

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.400
I just met George.
He's a real jerk.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.900
You shouldn't like him.
I want to see you.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.500
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.700
No!

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.700
Falling.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.700
What is wrong with you?

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.100
I'm being bitten!

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.400
Does he have fish in his pants?

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.800
Oh, those fuckers are vicious.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.300
Yeah? Well, they don't like it

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.000
when someone disturbs
their environment.

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:09.600
Time to go, buddy.

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.600
I know I've been acting crazy,
but there's a reasonable-

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:12.900
Let me guess, Charlie.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.400
You believe
you're a lucky charm,

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.400
and you're afraid I'm going
to marry the next guy I date,

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:20.000
so you've been smothering me
and attacking my friends.

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.100
What about George, okay?

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.700
What about your date with George?

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.700
Wednesday night?
What big date with George?

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.500
George is my hairdresser!

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:30.900
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I was eavesdropping.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.900
Are you really
Charlie Logan the lucky charm?

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.600
Because... I was wondering-

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.800
I can't. I'm sorry.
Cam, listen. Cam-

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.800
- No. Charlie, I just don't think we can
do this anymore.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.700
- Don't say it!

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.120
- It's not working.
- Please, Cam.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.300
Please, just don't say it's over.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.600
It's over.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:17.600
Dr. Charlie?

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.600
Hi, Reba.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.600
I've been calling you all day.

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.800
Where have you been?

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:24.799
Decided to take another day off.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.700
Hey, does our building
have roof access?

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.000
Oh, things can't be that bad.

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:34.400
You know, I owe you a thank-you.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.300
I met a guy, and he's wonderful.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.000
I really think he's the one.

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:43.100
That's great.
I'm happy for you.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.800
You've done a good thing,
Dr. Charlie.

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:51.200
Helping people find love.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.600
It's great.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.800
I bet you didn't think
you'd be responsible

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.600
for helping me
find true love again,

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:00.900
but you did.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.800
You did, Dr. Charlie.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.400
Dr. Charlie, are you all right?

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.500
Love fall like rain.
I'm in pain.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.100
She was right, Reba.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.200
It's raining.

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:23.100
Oh, my God!

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:28.800
Stu, I need to Google something.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.100
Unacceptable!

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.400
Hey!

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.700
I wish I hadn't seen that!

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.700
A man can't masturbate
in his own house?

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.200
That is disgusting.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.500
It's a known fact

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.200
that stimulation
of the prostate-

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:41.600
No, no, no, no.
Just get dressed

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.300
and wash your hands!

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.200
All I know is that I'm hexed.

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:50.800
Yeah. If by hexed
you mean bat-shit crazy,

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.060
then yeah, you're hexed, man.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:53.200
Don't you remember?

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.600
Black lipstick,
long fingernails. A total freak.

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.399
She wanted me
to show her my penis.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.000
I wouldn't,
so she pulled my nipples

01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.500
and put a hex on me.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:02.400
Stu, I've lost the most
special person of my life.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.500
I have to break this spell.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.800
You haven't lost me, dude.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.100
I'm here for you always.

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.900
Just drive the fucking car.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.000
Oh, I'm so sorry, buddy.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.400
Hey, what's up with Chester?

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.400
His girlfriend Molly's sick.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.500
I sent her away for treatment.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.300
He stopped grooming himself.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.600
It's heartbreaking, you know?

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.100
If she doesn't come back,

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.700
he may never find another mate.

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:46.300
Murphy, maybe
you reacted too harshly.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.300
You should call him.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.600
I can't, Joe.

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:51.700
You saw him.
He's crazy.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.700
Love does that to you sometimes.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.040
I don't want another one
of your philosophy lessons, Joe.

01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:59.000
He was smothering me.

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:01.300
I want to be part of someone's life,

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.500
not all of it.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:07.000
Have you taken a look
at your bedroom lately?

01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.600
If you love something,

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:12.100
sometimes you just want
to be surrounded by it.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.500
That's it. That's it.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.999
How can I get her
to break the spell?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.500
I don't know. She wanted to look
at your penis, right?

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.000
That was a joke.

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.400
Chuck?

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:36.300
Chuck, that was a joke.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.300
Oh, my God.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.000
Hi. Is your mother home?

01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:51.400
Is your mother's name Anisha?

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.800
What's with the 50 questions?

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:55.300
That was two questions.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.700
It's a hyperbole.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.300
Sweetheart, who is it?

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:04.000
Are you Anisha Carpenter?

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:06.000
Do I know you?

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.200
Charlie Logan.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.200
Look, I know this is
going to sound crazy,

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.900
but you put a hex on me

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.200
so that all my girlfriends

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.100
would fall in love
with other people,

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.900
and I need you...

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.500
to reverse the spell?

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:27.900
Woo! That-
That's your pendant.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.400
You used to wear that!

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.400
You wore it at the party
when you pulled out my hair

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.100
and did the-with the thing.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.500
And then you wanted
to see my penis,

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.700
and I said no.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.700
Go to your room, Lila.
Lock the door.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.200
But this is just getting good.

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:41.300
Now.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.900
I'm sorry.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.400
What can I do to convince you
to help me?

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:11.300
This spell-
turn it off, please.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.800
Charlie, I was just a kid.

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.200
I didn't know what I was doing.

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:15.600
I don't even know what I did.

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.200
You fucked up my life!

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.400
That's what you did.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.200
I asked you
to watch your language.

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:22.600
Your room. Now.

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:30.600
Anisha, I am begging you.

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:33.000
Have you ever wanted
someone so badly

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.200
that you would do anything
to get them?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.500
If someone's meant to be yours,

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.100
eventually they will be.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.200
No.
Wait. No!

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:50.100
If you think
that by me being here,

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.300
we're supposed
to get together-

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.400
I wasn't talking about you.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.700
My husband Kurt.

01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.400
Really, Charlie, I was 10.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.500
I may have thought
I was in love,

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.500
but I was also hot
for Scott Baio.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.400
So-

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:16.000
I've blown it.

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:20.400
Well, then,
all you can do is let her go.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.500
Yeah, dude!

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.300
You're my hero!

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:39.300
How was she?

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.500
Take me home.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.400
I'm not that easy, man.

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:46.500
You're going to have to
take me to dinner first.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.700
You little munchkin.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.600
I have to set her free,

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:52.800
let Mother Nature
take its course.

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.700
If you love something,
set it free, right?

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.600
I think Cam is really
going to respond

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.000
to the new gay you, Chuck.

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:02.200
Take me home.

01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.900
I got a phone call to make.

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:19.000
Hi. I'm trying to find
Howard Blaine.

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:20.300
Hi, Howard.

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.100
Um, we've never met,

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:26.500
but I have a friend
that you really need to meet.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.000
Howard?

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.100
Eat me.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.700
Eat me.

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.200
Gotcha.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:25:59.800
Owned.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.800
Owned.

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.600
I'm getting married!

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.300
Chuck! I found my dream girl,

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.400
and it's all because
of you I just proposed.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.300
Lara, get your sweet ass
over here.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.700
You remember Lara?

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.800
Lara stepped out of heaven-

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:23.300
and into my office
to correct a condition.

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:24.600
She's got polymastia.

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.600
Has more than two boobs.

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:29.800
Isn't that perfect for me?
Show him.

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:30.800
No, no.

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.200
No, no, that's okay.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:33.600
Really. I don't mind.

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:35.899
Yeah, I used to be
embarrassed about it,

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.700
but that was before
pookie pants here

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.000
made me realize
how special I am.

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:41.200
Oh, baby,
you're so goddamn special.

01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:43.100
Oh, I love you, monkey pie.

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.700
- Okay, show him.
- Okay.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.300
Is that or is that not

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.600
the most beautiful sight
you've ever seen in your life?

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.900
It's like seeing
the Grand Canyon for the first time.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.600
It's like seeing Earth
from space.

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.400
Like Three's Company,

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.400
but all Chrissies,
you know what I'm saying?

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:02.600
I'm happy for you, buddy.

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.800
But, dude, that's not
why we came, okay?

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:10.300
Did you know that it smells
like shit in here?

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.300
You may want to open a window.

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:13.800
It's making me a little-

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.100
Okay, you tell him, baby.

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:17.800
Okay, so I'm friends with Katie,
who knows Cam,

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.900
and she said that Cam
said she's leaving today

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.600
for Antarctica
with some penguin guru.

01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:29.100
That's nice.
I'm happy for her.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.000
You sure as shit
don't look happy.

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:38.200
I loved something,
and I set her free.

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.000
She met somebody else.

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:43.100
But I set her free.
That's what's important.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.600
She's leaving, buddy...

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.300
for Antarctica...

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.100
right now.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:01.300
She is going.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.500
She's going.

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:10.899
She's... leaving.

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.300
What the fuck am I doing?

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.500
That's what we're saying!

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.300
Go!
Go get your girl, will you?

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.400
He's a little slow.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.400
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, guys.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.800
Ma'am, excuse me.

01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:58.600
Has the flight for
Antarctica boarded yet?

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.800
There are no direct flights, sir.

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:01.900
Connecting flight?

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.000
Which one?
There are two.

01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:05.200
Has the flight

01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:07.900
with a passenger
named Cam Wexler boarded yet?

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.300
Sorry, sir.
Can't give you that information.

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.800
Sir, you won't be able to go
to the gate without a ticket.

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:16.400
I have to get to Antarctica,

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:19.600
so I will take a ticket
for both planes.

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:23.300
There are only first class
tickets available, sir.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.600
Of course there are.
I'll take them both.

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.200
Are you traveling
with any baggage?

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:31.400
No.

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.200
No.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.800
You do realize
that it's -60 degrees there.

01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:36.900
Yes.

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.700
And that'll be $17,412.

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:49.500
Just do it.

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:55.000
Here you go.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:06.100
Shoes, belt, watch.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.100
You've never been
to an airport, dummy?

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:16.800
What goes in pockets?

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:18.100
Change.

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.100
Change.
Change goes in pockets.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.320
Put it in the little bucket.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.800
Don't waste my big bucket.

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:24.400
No.
Small bucket!

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:25.800
I don't need it.

01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:27.000
Want to make this quick?

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:28.500
I am in a real hurry.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.000
Let's do this.
Take your pants off.

01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.400
What?

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.600
You heard me.
Take your pants off.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.800
I'm kidding you, weirdo.
Don't do that.

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:39.400
Why would you do that?

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.800
Come on, let's go.

01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:45.100
Go, go, go.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.400
Cam.

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.800
Wait!
One more! Here.

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:19.500
I meant to do that.

01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:31.600
Here.

01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:32.700
Thanks.

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.500
Charlie?

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.800
I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad.

01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:40.700
Antarctica? You couldn't have
just taken her to a movie?

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.000
Charlie-

01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:44.200
Look, I know that it's
crazy that I'm here,

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:46.900
but it felt even crazier
not to come.

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.500
Excuse me.
You have to take your seats.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:50.500
Charlie-

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:51.700
My entire life,

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.520
I've been nothing more
than a stepping-stone

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.300
to every relationship
I've ever been in.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.400
There's always been a next guy
who's better than me.

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:02.400
For once in my life,
I want to be that next guy.

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:09.400
I've never said this
to anybody in my whole life.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:10.500
Cam...

01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:16.500
I love you.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.000
I love you, Cam.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.200
Please don't go.

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:28.200
Charlie, I'm coming back
on Wednesday.

01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.700
What?

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:30.700
Yeah.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.900
But Howard and-

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.400
Have you met
Howard's wife Marilyn?

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.800
Howard's wife?

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:39.400
Howard's wife.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.500
Hi.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.000
Hi, Howard's wife.

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:43.100
Howard's wife.

01:32:43.101 --> 01:32:45.600
I know about your call
to Howard.

01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:47.400
I knew you wanted to meet him.

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.400
I knew it would make you happy.

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.700
I swear that's all
I've ever wanted to do.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.600
Plus, mate selection
is up to the female.

01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:58.700
But, Charlie,
you've been acting so-

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:00.500
I know, I know.
Idiotic, nuts.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.600
And no more lucky charm excuse.

01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:06.000
I'm done thinking
about the past and what could be.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:09.000
All I care about now is what is.

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:11.500
And this-

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.800
This is.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.500
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:20.300
we are about to close
the cabin doors.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.500
Please take your seats.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:25.700
That's for you.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.300
Here.

01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.700
Charlie!

01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.300
Excuse me, are you that guy who-

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:01.600
He isn't anymore.

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.800
Excuse me.

01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:20.600
Giggle monkey,
what are you looking for?

01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.000
Sex tapes.

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:25.700
What is the point in house sitting
if you can't scope out

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:28.900
some good old-fashioned
homemade porn!

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.300
- Score!
- You're a genius.

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:34.500
Okay.

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:35.600
Hold on.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.400
Do it. Do it. Oh, yeah.

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:46.400
Babe.

01:35:46.401 --> 01:35:48.000
Yeah, what?

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:49.100
Oh, you like that.

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.200
You like when I do
stuff with the-

01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:53.700
All right. I'll do it
for just one last time.

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:54.700
This is it.

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:55.900
Okay.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Because I'm not into bestiality,

01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:58.540
and you know that.
That's documented.

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.100
No, I know. It's fake.

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:01.100
All right.

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.100
But it's hot.

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.100
Okay.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.500
Hey. So, uh...

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.800
so do you want to-

01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:08.400
You come to this glacier often?

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:13.200
I'm really interested in you
because you're a Gentoo soul.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:15.700
You like that?

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:18.100
Yeah, I like that.
Do it faster.

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.300
You like... when I do that?

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.500
You ever seen me
go down on a-

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.700
Shh. It's okay. No, no.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.200
Baby, baby, don't worry.

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:29.500
Yeah, I like that.

01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:36.500
You like that, don't you?

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:37.500
Yeah.

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.600
Oh, that's so hot.

01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:40.900
Shh. No more "Uhh."
No more "Uhh."

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:45.700
Do it. Yeah.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.800
Oh, yeah.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.800
That's really good.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.400
Okay, now do the other thing.

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:53.600
Do the other thing.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.800
Look at me. Here's
really what you like.

01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:00.700
Yeah, you know what I like.

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.300
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm really
getting in the mood now.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.300
You like when I eat
your penguin ass?

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:08.700
Yeah. Baby,
I think I'm ready.

01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:13.600
Turn it off, baby.

01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:16.500
You still in the mood?

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:17.600
Yeah.

01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:18.700
All right.
