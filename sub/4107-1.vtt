01:18.662 --> 01:20.872
Ja, all this is under control.

01:40.392 --> 01:45.062
A hundred and fifty million dollars,
and my dope is on the way.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.690
Today is gonna be a good day.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.236
We are 25 degrees north,
84 degrees west.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.989
The cargo's being dropped.

02:27.773 --> 02:28.940
Good.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.983
- Do you wanna see his gun?
- Yeah.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.364
Bang. Bang.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.159
Sorry, Johnny.

02:40.536 --> 02:41.828
Fucking bitches.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.959
Infrared's got a live one on the water.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.211
Air Force Stallion C-14 to Coast Guard.

02:50.420 --> 02:54.841
We've got a fast-moving contact
heading 3-5-0 toward South Florida.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.052
Captain, Air Force Stallion has a
contact at 1-8-0 closing fast.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.472
This is Coast Guard cutter Valiant.
Request to know your intentions.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.517
Vessel off our port bow,
this is U.S. Coast Guard.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.520
Intercept is 1-8-0, speed 17 knots.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.397
Make it so, chief. Scramble the helo.

03:13.652 --> 03:16.195
Vessel off our port bow.
Vessel off our port bow.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.488
This is U.S. Coast Guard.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.074
Request to know your intentions
at this time.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.913
Incoming.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.051
Valiant, Valiant, Valiant.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.137
This is Coast Guard 6-0-0-3.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.598
Negative contact with target. Over.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.391
Captain, we've lost target.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.781
Here's your delivery and payment.

04:03.952 --> 04:04.994
Is it done?

04:05.245 --> 04:08.122
- Cargo is on Dixie 7.
- Okay.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.010
All right, TNT, for the millionth time,
listen up.

04:21.219 --> 04:25.431
Since 9-11, we've gone hi-tech over
water. Dope runners have gone low.

04:25.641 --> 04:28.601
Our source says the biggest X
shipment on record arrives tonight...

04:28.810 --> 04:30.478
and we wanna know who's behind it.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.397
Hopefully, in a few hours,
we'll have our answer.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.316
We'll hit from three directions:

04:35.525 --> 04:40.112
We'll go in with a water team, vehicle
assault and we got guys on foot.

04:40.322 --> 04:45.159
We cannot make a move until our UCs
have ID'd the drugs and called us in.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.955
No call, we back away.
And these guys we're going after...

04:49.164 --> 04:53.668
they got a lot of firepower and they
hate the law. So eyes open out there.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.343
Bravo's on the move.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.865
Heads up. Here comes the drop.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.834
Fuck. My lens is flaring.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.711
I can't see shit.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.715
Brothers! Gather around!

05:43.552 --> 05:44.552
Hey.

05:44.761 --> 05:48.139
- Why didn't you say there was a rally?
- Who's looking?

05:48.348 --> 05:51.058
- Take that shit. I'm out of here.
- Shit.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.354
- White power!
- White power!

05:55.564 --> 05:57.982
- White power!
- White power!

06:02.821 --> 06:05.197
Blue power, motherfuckers. Miami PD.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.867
Aw, damn. It's the nigras.

06:08.076 --> 06:11.078
Casper, drop the bag.
Alpha leader, bring them in.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.290
Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do?

06:14.583 --> 06:17.460
What you gonna do When we come for you?

06:21.631 --> 06:24.675
- Dude, you gotta learn the words.
- We usually only do the chorus.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.635
Alpha leader, hit it. Br

06:26.845 --> 06:28.220
Repeat your transmission.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.266
Alpha leader to Bravo Four,
please continue relay.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.435
Where's backup?

06:34.770 --> 06:37.897
- Alpha leader, bring them in. Hit it.
- Mike, I'm only getting static.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.940
It's all static. The radios are fucked.

06:41.276 --> 06:44.612
- Something funny? Something funny?
- Mike, where are they?

06:49.576 --> 06:51.243
Got you, nigger.

06:53.789 --> 06:57.041
- Looks like we got us a situation here.
- You won't shoot.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.920
You got a gun to his head, so you
think I won't splatter you all over?

07:01.129 --> 07:02.129
That's what I think.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.174
My partner came here tonight
prepared to die.

07:05.383 --> 07:06.467
Hell Hell, no!

07:06.676 --> 07:09.261
Incinerating trash like you.
Ready to die, right, Marcus?

07:09.471 --> 07:12.181
- The fuck I wanna do that for?
- Scared, ain't you, boy?

07:12.390 --> 07:14.892
A: Put the gun down, tell me
who brings this shit in...

07:15.102 --> 07:17.186
and maybe I'll just
pop one in your shoulder.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.022
Or B: Keep acting all Brody,
and I'll put one in your chest.

07:20.232 --> 07:23.025
Or C: You know, take the time
to talk a minute.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.653
You know, de-escalate the situation.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.197
See, that's my partner's
new spiritual bullshit.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.075
Me? I actually prefer shooting
motherfuckers.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.119
A lot of movement going on.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.495
Can't see the UCs.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.081
- I think something's going down.
- Don't move yet.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.542
Mike, the man has a gun to my head.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.169
He'll put it down if a hollow point's
in his eye!

07:42.379 --> 07:44.213
Your partner's a cocky nigger.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.508
- Damn. Now, was that necessary, sir?
- See?

07:47.717 --> 07:50.010
He can't just be a cop?
He got to be a nigga too?

07:50.220 --> 07:51.262
I'll hot this fool.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.681
- Calm down.
- Calm down? I'm calm.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.100
I'm calm! Hey!

07:56.977 --> 07:59.520
I am way too unstable for that bullshit.

07:59.729 --> 08:03.357
Stop all the goddamned movement!
Everybody stop moving!

08:03.567 --> 08:06.569
We can't let you all go, but this
shit will get worked out in court.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.654
We got our rights.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.073
Exercise your right to shut the fuck up.

08:11.575 --> 08:16.579
I'm all right. I'll give you a warning.
It's the best I can do for all of youse!

08:16.788 --> 08:18.455
Okay? He's crazy.

08:18.665 --> 08:22.543
- You got three seconds to drop your gun.
- He has anger issue problems!

08:22.752 --> 08:24.879
- One.
- He goes to bed early for this shit!

08:25.088 --> 08:27.631
Just to wake up to pop one
in a motherfucker!

08:27.841 --> 08:29.550
- Two!
- Mike, no!

08:29.759 --> 08:30.801
Gun!

08:33.763 --> 08:35.347
Rock 'n' roll! Let's go!

08:35.557 --> 08:36.932
Kill them cops!

09:09.174 --> 09:10.257
Marcus!

09:45.669 --> 09:47.920
Go! Go! Go! Come on, go!

09:53.969 --> 09:55.344
- Get down!
- Drop the!

09:57.389 --> 09:58.931
- I didn't do shit!
- Get your hands up.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.140
I didn't do it!

10:00.350 --> 10:03.769
The radios were fucked up. Get some
medics over here. You guys okay?

10:03.979 --> 10:06.313
- Yeah, we're fine.
- What you mean, "we"?

10:06.523 --> 10:09.191
Motherfucker shot me in the ass, man.

10:10.193 --> 10:13.195
- Who shot you in the ass?
- Who? That "who" would be you.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.406
- Me? I shot you?
- Yeah.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.993
I mean, I was shooting.
Yeah, I did a lot of shooting.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.662
But I ain't saying I shot you
in the ass.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.456
I ain't saying I didn't shoot you...

10:24.708 --> 10:28.419
but, damn! Somebody shot you in the ass.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.670
Tell me about it.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.006
- Yo, man, how's it feel?
- It's hot, man.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.008
I can smell my ass burning.

10:34.217 --> 10:37.303
Mike, you should give it a little kiss
so it'll feel better.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.305
Pretend like we're not even here.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.349
Hey, isn't Ricky Martin having
a concert? Get the fuck on.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.394
- You always gotta go racial, man.
- It's sad, man.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.441
I think it's cool. It hit the meat.
It ain't nowhere near the hole.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.278
Two lousy bags?

10:54.487 --> 10:58.157
What about the biggest shipment
of ecstasy to come out of Amsterdam?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.075
Let me worry about my snitch, all right?

11:00.285 --> 11:02.328
It's a lot of cop work for nothing!

11:02.537 --> 11:04.413
Take your ass home somewhere.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.882
Tonight la policia jacked my mules.

11:15.091 --> 11:19.887
Who can tell me how those jackals
knew where to bite Johnny Tapia?

11:20.096 --> 11:22.514
Speak up, cousins.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.768
You're lucky they did not find
my drugs on Dixie 7.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.728
Change the boat schedule.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.314
We can't. We got a shipment Thursday.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.734
Change it after.
Just keep them guessing.

11:35.362 --> 11:40.157
You know, unlike you, my daddy
didn't leave me no trust fund.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.743
I got real-world shit
to deal with, Mike.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.287
I'm not in it for the thrills.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.498
Same old shit, different day.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.293
All right, yes, damn.
I shot you, all right?

11:51.795 --> 11:54.463
But you'd be seeing nothing at all
if I hadn't made my move.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.256
I don't know why you acting so angry.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.760
- You're misinformed. I'm not angry.
- No, you're very angry.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.804
No, I'm not angry.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.599
You are angry. It's okay.

12:05.809 --> 12:10.229
I'm not angry. Except when
you keep repeating "you're angry."

12:10.438 --> 12:12.356
That shit's fucking annoying.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.442
Like a fucking gnat at a barbecue.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.945
Just bugging the fuck out of me.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.072
Good. I want you to say:

12:20.281 --> 12:24.618
"I'm angry. It's okay.
I'll process my anger.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.537
I love myself."

12:28.331 --> 12:29.915
I don't know what the fuck you mean.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.501
Yes, you do know what the fuck I mean.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.253
You're the one that needs therapy.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.712
- I did my therapy.
- When?

12:36.005 --> 12:39.174
Captain Howard made me do it after
I shot them people at the airport.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.474
Officer Mike.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.354
- Papi. That's "daddy," right?
- Yeah.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.652
Mike, you go to therapy
to get your issues worked out...

12:58.862 --> 13:00.654
not bang your therapist.

13:00.864 --> 13:04.283
- See, now you just talking nasty.
- I gotta survive.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.077
I gotta start loving me for me.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.371
That sound like that group thing.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.332
Maybe I did the group thing
once or twice.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.419
And:

13:16.921 --> 13:21.884
A bunch of men hugging and kissing,
that's some cult shit.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.048
Buy.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.092
Ignore him, doc, he's blowing
this out of proportion.

14:45.301 --> 14:49.221
My ass is what's out of proportion,
Mike, okay? I got a big chunk missing.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.889
It's actually a small chunk.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.433
This tension you bringing
into this relationship...

14:53.643 --> 14:55.227
won't be healthy in the long run.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.521
Maybe there ain't gonna be no long run.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.897
Whatever.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.400
He's seeing a shrink. I mean:

15:05.071 --> 15:07.948
- Icepick, Lowrey.
- Hey, brother.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.159
Two bags? You embarrassed me
in front of my people.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.621
Wait, brother. No, no, no, brother.
Wait, wait, wait.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.541
Whatever. You better pray
to whoever it is you pray to...

15:17.750 --> 15:21.253
because you got 24 hours
to find that X before I find you.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.803
The cops hit my mule.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.806
Well, Mr. Tapia, I don't know
where the heat is coming from.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.767
It's a delicate situation
for both of us, isn't it?

15:36.019 --> 15:39.229
- I'm telling you, I've checked them.
- Alex, look. A guy's OD'ing.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.814
I'm sorry, I gotta hang up.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.442
Some fucking punk
thinks he can die in my club.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.530
Ecstasy fucks them up.

15:49.866 --> 15:53.702
- Get him out of here, Josef.
- Sure. We'll dump him around the block.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.000
Dump him.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.688
Auntie Syd, it must be so cool.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.066
Young, single, living in New York.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.526
Probably hook up
with a lot of cute guys.

16:26.736 --> 16:30.322
- Just like Sex and the City.
- Theresa, cancel the damn cable.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.408
So, Auntie Syd, you're a cop too, huh?

16:33.618 --> 16:36.328
Sort of. I work for the DEA,
but I just push a lot of papers.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.789
- Nothing exciting.
- Well, you keep pushing papers.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.668
Don't have to worry about
my little sister fighting crime.

16:42.877 --> 16:43.919
Okay?

16:44.587 --> 16:46.755
Possibly getting hurt.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.093
James. Get my screwdriver. Damn bolts.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.553
Ignore him. He's being mean
because he got injured.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.890
- Are you okay?
- His wound is fine. It's...

16:57.100 --> 16:59.768
other things that were affected.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.603
- Theresa!
- What?

17:02.605 --> 17:05.315
You It's just nerve damage, that's all.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.859
Y'all not gonna spoil it.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.444
I'll talk to you about it.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.830
It's a donut.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.207
It's a medical thing.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.419
I got it from a maternity store.
You know, pregnant women use it.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.714
They can put one cheek here.
It take pressure off the other cheek.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.133
- For you, dog.
- Thoughtful.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.094
Look, man...

17:34.303 --> 17:36.805
last night there was something
different in your eyes.

17:37.014 --> 17:40.434
You know, Mike, I had an epiphany.
You know?

17:41.227 --> 17:44.146
- I realised you're an enigma.
- Yeah, I could see that.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.315
God sent you here to test me.
But guess what.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.444
You not gonna break me, Mike. No.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.448
Is that Syd?

17:54.657 --> 17:56.658
- That's Syd.
- Now's not a good time.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.869
Mike, listen, now's not a good time.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.579
Hit me, hit me, hit me.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.665
No throwing balls in the house.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.590
- What's up, Theresa?
- Hey.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.800
Aw, they ain't tell me it was a luau.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.428
Hey, hey.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.639
Hey, whoa, Syd.
Hold up. Hold up. Hold on.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.517
Behave yourself, girl. Hey, hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.228
Oh, look at you. Look at you.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.522
Oh, okay. Okay. I see now.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.317
You didn't tell Marcus about New York.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.737
- He knows about New York.
- About us? You told him about us?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.822
No, he knows about New York.

18:36.032 --> 18:40.202
You know, it's a nice city and that I
dropped a witness off last month.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.290
Mike is so sweet.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.920
- So sweet he make your teeth rot.
- So have you told him yet?

18:50.588 --> 18:53.173
Baby, soon, okay? Real soon.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.760
He needs to know you're transferring
and won't be his partner anymore.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.678
Theresa, timing is everything.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.014
Marcus is not very happy
with me right now.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.016
- Mike.
- No, no, Syd, I'm telling you.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.851
That is Scarface
limping around in there.

19:05.061 --> 19:08.104
We need to give that boy a few
minutes to let his butt heal up good.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.190
We like each other. What's the big deal?

19:10.399 --> 19:13.360
I'm just gonna go tell him right now,
because this is dumb.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.612
Hold up. Hold up. I'm gonna tell him.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.198
It ain't like I won't tell him.
How am I not tell him?

19:18.407 --> 19:20.075
- When?
- I need a minute.

19:20.284 --> 19:23.870
Straight up. We're not vibing
right now. I just need a minute.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.208
Mike, he's my brother, okay?
Don't be scared. Toughen up, chief.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.169
Hey. Hey, I ain't say I was scared.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.504
Just

19:32.713 --> 19:34.339
There's something wrong
with your brother.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.720
So, Mike, I understand you
were in New York last month.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.600
Yeah, I was...

19:45.893 --> 19:48.144
- Remember I did the thing?
- No.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.646
You remember?

19:49.856 --> 19:53.650
The two of you should've gotten
together. That would've been nice.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.778
I never told you Mike was in New York.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.864
Well, you know what, Mike?

19:59.073 --> 20:02.284
Syd, she's gonna be in town,
what, another week?

20:02.493 --> 20:04.619
Why don't you show her around?
That'd be nice.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.204
That would be so great.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.499
Yeah. Yeah, I could Well, me and...

20:10.167 --> 20:13.378
Marcus, you wanna show her some stuff?

20:14.714 --> 20:17.132
Yeah, because I'm in town on vacation.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.217
I'm staying at the most amazing hotel.

20:19.510 --> 20:22.304
The view, the pool. Oh, my God.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.389
We got a pool right here.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.850
That ain't exactly a pool, man.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.478
That's like a big-ass puddle
wrapped in blue plastic.

20:30.688 --> 20:33.398
Didn't they have any good pools
when you bought this one?

20:33.608 --> 20:35.650
Megan, that pool cost $3900.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.153
Okay, so how much
do the good pools cost?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.947
- It's all right, baby.
- It is kind of whack, huh?

20:41.824 --> 20:45.035
I gotta go meet somebody.
It was nice seeing you again, Mike.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.203
Nice Good to see you.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.706
Where you going?

20:49.916 --> 20:50.999
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.876
I thought you were on vacation.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.337
So glad you could join us, Mike.

20:55.546 --> 20:58.506
I'm telling you, spending time like this
make a partnership strong.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.550
Mike, can I see you by my stupid pool?

21:01.719 --> 21:03.345
What's the deal, baby?

21:04.305 --> 21:07.182
Why you gotta always come over
here and try to take over, Mike?

21:07.391 --> 21:10.560
- What are you talking about?
- This is my family, man. Okay?

21:10.770 --> 21:13.063
- What are you talking about?
- My place of peace.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.981
Are you taking medication?

21:15.191 --> 21:17.192
You taking medicine
for the thing, right?

21:17.401 --> 21:19.527
- What'd I do?
- Forget it. Just forget it.

21:19.737 --> 21:22.322
- What'd I do?
- Mason, go fetch.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.581
Oh, shit!

21:36.420 --> 21:37.921
Now, that shit is funny.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.423
That's some funny shit.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.425
Oh, man, hold up.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.469
Yo, Lowrey, you hot.

21:44.679 --> 21:47.055
Thirty-nine hundred dollars.
Thirty-nine hundred.

21:47.264 --> 21:50.892
You better pray to God you right
this time. Yo, dry off, sweetheart.

21:51.102 --> 21:54.270
Icepick said the Haitian Zoepounds
about to do a rip. Let's move.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.535
All right, guys, smarten up. Talk to me.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.371
Eyes on, agents. Good luck.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.665
This is 105.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.127
They're backing in.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.712
I got a good look.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.464
- We got a good eyeball.
- All right, we're in.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.305
What's up?

22:37.314 --> 22:40.358
You come highly recommended
out of New York.

22:40.568 --> 22:43.778
You did some good jobs
for our Russian crew up there.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.321
How old are you?

22:45.740 --> 22:46.906
Old enough.

22:47.158 --> 22:50.452
Come on. If you wanna move
this stuff you gotta do it quick.

22:51.912 --> 22:54.873
Wow, nice getup. You can start
to run these through.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.916
I'd like to see how your machine works.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.545
That sounded dirty.

23:00.755 --> 23:03.882
"I would like to see how
your machine works, baby."

23:05.509 --> 23:06.718
I wouldn't be so crude.

23:06.927 --> 23:09.345
I mean, I'm more of a refined kind
of a human being.

23:11.265 --> 23:12.682
You follow ballet?

23:13.684 --> 23:17.604
Three of my cousins are dancing with
the famous Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.192
I like hippie-hop too.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.324
I gave you 5000.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.867
You gave me 4900.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.911
- I gave you 5000.
- Forty-nine hundred.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.120
- Five thousand.
- Count it.

23:34.330 --> 23:37.874
If you want to fuck with me again,
find yourself another chump.

23:38.501 --> 23:39.542
Okay.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.005
- How much?
- Three.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.758
Look at this. Money everywhere.
Clean it up.

23:46.967 --> 23:51.054
Okay, we wanna change a little
over $3 million, all right?

23:51.889 --> 23:54.641
How many jobs did you do with
my friends up there in New York?

23:54.850 --> 23:55.892
Quite a few.

23:56.102 --> 23:59.187
How you behave with me
has consequences for a lot of people.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.523
You found me, not the other way around.

24:01.732 --> 24:05.193
You need me to change small bills to
large ones and deliver to a third party.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.612
I bet he'd like his money
in a timely fashion.

24:07.822 --> 24:10.406
Delivery's late,
it's your ass, not mine.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.881
Here's 50,000 in 100s
for your 50,000 in 10s.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.759
Third party takes his million
in these five briefcases here.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.846
- I hope I'm not losing you, chief.
- I hate math.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.682
So for your $3 million
that we shrunk for you...

24:35.891 --> 24:38.059
you get 2 million in clean money back.

24:38.269 --> 24:41.187
Less our percentage: $300,000.

24:41.397 --> 24:44.983
- I'll be delivering these to your dealer.
- Alexei.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.318
- What?
- We're giving too fucking much away.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.237
We take all the risk.

24:49.446 --> 24:53.032
And our suppliers take too much
of our profit.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.411
Yeah, we'll call the general,
renegotiate.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.664
He's a businessman, we're businessmen.

25:00.291 --> 25:01.583
Yeah, call him.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.084
You call.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.962
Agents, we're on the move
to the money drop.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.631
Forward.

25:08.966 --> 25:11.801
Hey, man, the truck's leaving.
We're going to follow it.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.098
Don't lose that truck.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.436
Follow that truck. Follow that truck.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.865
Yep, they saddling up.
Look like Icepick came through.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.659
Wonder whose shit they about to rip now?

26:18.702 --> 26:20.119
Falcon One, do you see her?

26:22.539 --> 26:23.831
Stand by.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.292
I don't wanna get spotted, take a burn.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.878
Zoepound a bunch of pirates, man.
Steal anything.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.895
Black Suburban at 10 o'clock.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.315
Oh, come on, baby. Park it at the top.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.192
Roberto, she's coming to you.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.406
I got her.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.494
This is Falcon One, guys.
I got her coming up.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.163
Heads up, guys.
I got an orange muscle car.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.708
Looks to be three black male occupants.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.252
It's out of our field of vision.
Bring it up.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.879
All right, be aware,
we got three bogeys unidentified.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.727
Guys, we got three bogeys.
They're splitting up. They're moving.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.812
Be aware. They're approaching
Shit. Shit.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.776
- Fuck, it's a hit!
- Shit.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.954
Agent down. Agent down.

27:47.458 --> 27:48.791
Roberto, fucking follow them!

27:49.001 --> 27:50.501
- I'm on it! I'm on it!
- Shit!

27:51.462 --> 27:52.587
Stay here!

27:52.796 --> 27:54.297
Son of a bitch!

28:35.297 --> 28:36.339
It's Syd!

28:37.549 --> 28:39.384
Move! Move!

28:43.222 --> 28:45.306
Man, what is your sister into?

28:56.360 --> 28:57.985
Sidewalk! Sidewalk!

28:59.530 --> 29:00.571
Move! Move! Move!

29:02.491 --> 29:03.866
Shit.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.546
- Shit!
- I need backup on Canal, now!

29:22.678 --> 29:24.429
You just get ready to shoot.

29:28.225 --> 29:29.475
Police!

29:30.978 --> 29:32.061
Stop the car!

29:32.271 --> 29:35.189
Man, your badge? He has a gun!
Shoot him!

29:51.206 --> 29:52.874
Mike, she's in trouble, man.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.462
Move! Get out of the way!

30:10.976 --> 30:13.644
I think I done just got mad.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.572
- Gun! Gun! Gun!
- Hold on.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.751
Now show them your badge!

31:07.950 --> 31:10.159
- This shit is crazy.
- I know, right?

31:10.619 --> 31:11.953
Move! Move!

31:31.223 --> 31:33.057

32:40.292 --> 32:42.543
Go, go, go, Mike! Punch that shit!
Punch it!

33:04.775 --> 33:06.150
Kill the fucker!

33:16.620 --> 33:17.912
Shit!

33:23.418 --> 33:24.710
Move! Move!

33:29.508 --> 33:31.342
- Don't lose her, Mike!
- This is what I do!

33:49.111 --> 33:50.236
Shit! Shit.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.446
Definitely shoot

Oh, man, my headlight.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.618
Shoot back! Shoot back! Shoot! Shoot!

34:09.464 --> 34:12.425
What the? What are you doing, man?

34:12.634 --> 34:14.760
- That's my bad.
- Shoot outside!

34:14.969 --> 34:16.804
Pay attention to what you're doing.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.407
These dudes is off the chain!

34:46.877 --> 34:48.002
Jesus! Fuck!

34:55.342 --> 34:58.220
- This is some sick shit!
- Yep, it's about to get sicker.

35:08.899 --> 35:10.441
Watch out! Watch out!

35:12.444 --> 35:13.527
Oh, sh!

35:13.737 --> 35:17.031
- Oh, they are not about to do that.
- Hell, yes, they are!

35:17.240 --> 35:18.741
Go!

35:28.960 --> 35:31.712
- You see that?
- They throwing cars! How can I not?

35:36.802 --> 35:39.762
- I'm just trying to help, okay?
- You know what'd be fucking helpful?

35:39.971 --> 35:42.556
Just shut the fuck up and let me drive!
Let's try that!

35:50.440 --> 35:52.900
Hey, come on, man,
with the screaming shit!

35:54.277 --> 35:57.196
I'm concentrating on dodging
these motherfuckers.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.829
Just relax.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.212
- That was a flip!
- That motherfucker flipped!

36:13.421 --> 36:16.757
- That one puckered up my butthole.
- Almost fucking crushed my head.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.903
The boat!

37:00.552 --> 37:04.054
I lost them. Yeah, I've got your cargo
to the backup drop point.

37:07.809 --> 37:10.895
Attention all units,
suspects still at large.

37:14.107 --> 37:15.149
There she is.

37:22.032 --> 37:23.991
What the fuck is going on, Syd?

37:24.993 --> 37:26.285
Some desk you're driving.

37:26.494 --> 37:29.580
Get over here, I'm undercover.
And please call off your dogs.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.458
I got DEA watching my back,
so don't blow my case.

37:32.959 --> 37:35.002
- We saved your life.
- And I appreciate that.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.671
What I don't appreciate is
you two following me here...

37:37.881 --> 37:40.341
nearly burning a case
that took five months to set up.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.177
So now we lie to each other?
Is that what we do?

37:43.386 --> 37:45.179
- What do you want me to do?
- All right.

37:45.388 --> 37:48.849
- Fuck that, Mike, she's wrong.
- Calm down. Relax.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.018
Syd, are there drugs in that truck?

37:51.227 --> 37:53.062
- There's cash.
- Where's it going?

37:53.980 --> 37:55.773
- I can't tell you that.
- Why not?

37:55.982 --> 37:59.318
Because I have a career and if I
wanna keep it, I have rules to follow.

37:59.527 --> 38:00.611
What's that mean?

38:00.820 --> 38:04.323
My orders are, under no circumstances
share information with Miami P.D...

38:04.532 --> 38:07.910
- because they got too many leaks.
- Oh, I'm Miami P.D. now?

38:08.119 --> 38:10.037
You done forgot
I'm your big brother, huh?

38:10.246 --> 38:13.123
You know what, Syd,
that shit you did was reckless...

38:13.333 --> 38:16.168
it was stupid and it was dangerous.
Okay?

38:16.670 --> 38:20.631
I'm telling Mommy. Okay?
I'm definitely leaking that shit.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.007
Hey, Marcus

38:24.594 --> 38:26.178
Syd, come on, he got a point.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.013
Your brother loves you.

38:28.390 --> 38:31.016
Not to mention a little thing
called professional courtesy.

38:31.226 --> 38:34.770
You bouncing in somebody's yard,
you should let them know about it.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.027
First time using your gun?

38:43.196 --> 38:46.115
Hey, you handled yourself very well.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.367
Too bad your partner didn't notice.

38:50.078 --> 38:51.412
Thanks.

38:51.621 --> 38:54.707
Think you get off that easy?
You been working this for five months?

38:54.916 --> 38:56.583
How come you ain't tell me in New York?

38:56.793 --> 38:58.585
- What would you have said?
- I would've

38:58.795 --> 39:01.463
I'd have let you know this job
is rugged, you know.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.299
It's dangerous. And if something
happen to you I might...

39:05.135 --> 39:07.469
Exactly why I didn't say anything.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.562
Somebody stealing your money.

39:20.150 --> 39:22.651
The drop's done. I gotta go.

39:27.741 --> 39:28.782
Thanks.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.970
We gotta close this case
before it get her killed.

39:50.263 --> 39:51.680
Yeah, no doubt.

39:52.015 --> 39:54.767
You ready to go back to the station,
get our asses whupped?

39:55.435 --> 39:57.561
I think we gonna be all right.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.564
Fellas.

40:00.774 --> 40:02.775
What's your job description?

40:03.193 --> 40:04.485
No, you two.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.529
What is your job description?

40:07.739 --> 40:08.739
I'll tell you.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.158
TNT:

40:11.367 --> 40:14.119
Tactical Narcotics Team.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.622
Keyword: "tactical."

40:17.665 --> 40:21.877
"Displaying finesse and subtlety
in achieving a goal!"

40:23.338 --> 40:24.797
Tell me, gentlemen...

40:25.006 --> 40:29.134
what was subtle about your work today?

40:34.891 --> 40:36.558
Twenty-two cars...

40:36.893 --> 40:39.019
and a boat, totalled?

40:40.480 --> 40:42.231
How did you sink a boat?

40:45.527 --> 40:47.236
We didn't sink it.

40:58.248 --> 41:01.208
All right, the positive.
Thank God no cops died.

41:01.417 --> 41:06.463
The negative: I got a police
commissioner so far up my ass...

41:06.673 --> 41:09.716
if he spits,
it's coming out of my mouth.

41:11.845 --> 41:15.347
But I know that there's
always two sides to a story.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.349
So, what's yours?

41:17.600 --> 41:20.185
Well, I was at a family barbecue.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.229
We got a tip that the Zoepounders...

41:22.438 --> 41:26.024
were gonna do a hit on cash or
drugs from this big-time X-man.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.652
That's what they call
a ecstasy dealer on the streets.

41:28.862 --> 41:30.988
Marcus, I know what they call them.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.115
That's why I'm captain. It's cool.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.117
So you got the drugs.

41:36.619 --> 41:39.955
No drugs. Oh, okay. All right.
How about the money?

41:40.373 --> 41:41.540
- No money.
- Nope.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.208
Then who is this X-man?

41:43.626 --> 41:46.086
Captain, I was at a family barbecue.
So I

41:46.296 --> 41:49.131
We don't know,
but we are going to find out.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.300
Well, then all that...

41:51.509 --> 41:54.052
- was for nothing?
- We didn't do all of that.

41:54.262 --> 41:57.055
If you look close
Watch. Hold up. Let me s

41:57.307 --> 42:00.934
There's DEA all over.
Wait, the Wait, hold up.

42:01.144 --> 42:03.228
The DEA? Without consulting me?

42:03.646 --> 42:05.063
That's a DEA car right there.

42:06.274 --> 42:07.941
Christ! Fuck!

42:08.151 --> 42:11.528
Cap. No. Remember your pressure points.

42:11.738 --> 42:14.114
Do my My exercises.

42:14.574 --> 42:16.158
Holler at your boy.

42:18.161 --> 42:20.787
Twenty-one thousand? What?

42:21.414 --> 42:24.583
Oh, kiss my black ass.

42:25.251 --> 42:27.002
It was the dashboard.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.172
- You know what?
- Better.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.840
Yeah, you'll get your money.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.218
Somebody's on they way with your money.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.932
Is it possible we could discuss
potential reimbursement

42:40.141 --> 42:43.227
We don't cover personal property.
That's why we drive police cars.

42:43.436 --> 42:45.103
So where do we go from here?

42:46.022 --> 42:48.982
Zoepounders knew exactly when
to hit the drop, where to hit the drop...

42:49.192 --> 42:51.151
so we figure they know
where the cash is.

42:51.361 --> 42:53.195
We find the cash, we find the X-man.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.740
Hey, I'm through playing games,
all right? I have three cops critical.

42:56.950 --> 42:59.743
I got kids dying on my streets
from souped-up X.

42:59.953 --> 43:03.747
I do not want these animals
taking over my city.

43:03.957 --> 43:05.082
Do you understand?

43:05.291 --> 43:09.044
So I want you guys to do whatever you
do, whatever it takes, but do it now.

43:16.803 --> 43:18.345
It's not good, boss.

43:23.643 --> 43:25.227
Oh, my God.

43:27.814 --> 43:30.816
Fucking ratones eating my fucking money.

43:32.151 --> 43:36.738
Carlos, this is a stupid
fucking problem to have.

43:37.031 --> 43:40.409
But it is a problem nonetheless.

43:40.994 --> 43:42.536
Rat fuckers.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.329
Rat fuckers.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.292
Boss, it ended up crazy.

43:48.501 --> 43:52.796
This black chica working for the
Russians was a maniac lunatic.

43:53.006 --> 43:54.006
She saved your money.

43:54.215 --> 43:56.550
She wasted some Haitians
and got the load to the drop.

43:56.759 --> 43:59.636
Also, Roberto saw these two
crazy gangbanger homeys.

43:59.846 --> 44:01.680
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah. Chasing and shooting.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.808
Old days, did I have this problem? No.

44:05.018 --> 44:08.603
Just fly the drugs in
and ship the money out.

44:11.399 --> 44:14.609
Now American security's
so goddamned tight over the water...

44:14.819 --> 44:15.986
and in the sky...

44:16.195 --> 44:19.531
that the rats eat my money
before I can get it to Cuba.

44:22.368 --> 44:23.994
- You see?
- Fiery crash...

44:24.203 --> 44:28.123
I can't even get my money across town
without making the news.

44:30.585 --> 44:31.626
Hey, man. Man.

44:32.128 --> 44:33.462
Tell me...

44:34.589 --> 44:36.048
should I be worried?

44:36.257 --> 44:38.383
- No, boss.
- Shut the fuck up.

44:38.634 --> 44:41.762
People is trying to jack my loads
here in Miami.

44:41.971 --> 44:44.890
I own this fucking town. You see?

44:45.266 --> 44:46.558
This is my town.

44:48.478 --> 44:50.812
Oh, my God. Pink.

44:51.105 --> 44:54.107
Pink, niña, pink. Pink. No powder blue.

44:54.317 --> 44:55.484
Pink is prettier.

44:55.693 --> 44:58.737
But the lady at the store
said I look like a model.

45:00.239 --> 45:04.493
You're lucky your mother
was my mother's cousins.

45:04.786 --> 45:06.495
Don't pay attention to Roberto.

45:07.455 --> 45:10.624
Besides, models are filthy creatures.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.793
You look more like an angel.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.712
- What do you think, Carlos?
- Of course.

45:15.922 --> 45:18.715
- Roberto, what do you think?
- It's fucking beautiful.

45:19.675 --> 45:24.012
Talk polite in front
of my little bonbon...

45:24.931 --> 45:27.641
or I'm gonna chop your balls off.

45:29.811 --> 45:33.480
For real, I'm straight with all your
spiritual enlightenment and that shit.

45:33.689 --> 45:37.234
But I need to know if a crackhead rolls
to me with a .9, you'll cook that fool.

45:37.443 --> 45:39.653
No question about it.
Shoot him in the leg.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.321
Come on with that leg shit.

45:41.531 --> 45:44.574
- Everybody deserves a little dignity.
- What about my dignity?

45:44.784 --> 45:47.661
Your crackhead will be missing
a kneecap. I'll be in a body bag.

45:47.870 --> 45:49.913
- So sad.
- What's so sad?

45:50.123 --> 45:52.749
Your untreated control issues.

45:52.959 --> 45:54.334
It's not your fault.

45:55.002 --> 45:57.087
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

45:57.296 --> 46:00.507
Your mama probably refused you
her tit when you were a baby.

46:00.716 --> 46:03.468
You grew up a malnourished
high-school softie.

46:03.678 --> 46:06.221
Got your gun, little tight T-shirt...

46:06.431 --> 46:09.057
and became a overcompensating tough guy.

46:10.476 --> 46:15.313
That is the last time you will ever
refer to my mother's titties.

46:16.399 --> 46:18.567
I don't even want them up in your head.

46:20.862 --> 46:24.531
You know, I said all that, Mike,
and all you heard was "titties."

46:25.241 --> 46:28.160
Man, you can't keep suppressing
my spiritual growth, Mike.

46:28.369 --> 46:31.621
You need to suppress my mother's
titties out of your psychoanalysis.

46:31.831 --> 46:35.584
You just remember one thing, my friend.
I may not always be here.

46:38.838 --> 46:40.714
What's up, Icepick?

46:41.674 --> 46:44.801
Jesus is the way, my brothers.
Step inside.

46:45.011 --> 46:47.220
You just went number one
on Uncle Mike's shit list.

46:47.430 --> 46:50.348
- We got two lousy bags, man.
- My brothers.

46:50.558 --> 46:52.642
Haitian blond with dreads. Where is he?

46:52.852 --> 46:54.394
Blondie Dread?

46:55.855 --> 46:58.064
He's very expensive.

46:58.274 --> 47:02.027
You and you have to do something for me.

47:02.236 --> 47:04.571
Oh, you trying to get gangster
on me like that?

47:04.947 --> 47:07.073
- Yeah, he went gangster.
- So we should probably

47:07.283 --> 47:09.743
- So we wanna do the? You got them?
- Yeah, sure.

47:09.952 --> 47:13.914
Me and my partner, we're on
the Miami P.D. tandem dance team.

47:14.123 --> 47:16.416
We got a routine.
We won all the local talent shows.

47:16.626 --> 47:18.043
We thinking about going national.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.629
You wanna show him some of the routine?

47:21.047 --> 47:23.798
Warm it up. Don't hurt nothing.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.383
Yo, yo, watch this. Watch this.

47:25.593 --> 47:27.886
This the shit right here.
This is the shit.

47:37.146 --> 47:39.731
- What you doing to my shop?
- Watch this spin.

47:39.941 --> 47:41.066
Wait.

47:44.153 --> 47:46.238
- What are you doing?
- Oh, give me some.

47:46.781 --> 47:48.073
You're ruining my shop. Stop!

47:48.658 --> 47:51.451
- Do the dance thing.
- I'm gonna bring the house down.

47:57.625 --> 47:59.292
Stop! Stop!

47:59.961 --> 48:03.880
He lives in a pink house
eight blocks from here on Carl Street.

48:09.762 --> 48:11.137
One...

48:11.931 --> 48:13.640
- Police! Get down.
- Police!

48:49.802 --> 48:51.761
Who that? Who in my house?

48:51.971 --> 48:56.099
- I'm the devil, who's asking?
- The devil is not welcome here!

48:56.309 --> 48:59.311
You got to call yourself the devil
in his house? Shit!

49:00.354 --> 49:02.188
You're in my house!

49:02.440 --> 49:04.190
This is all your fault!

49:04.525 --> 49:07.027
- You're in my country, though.
- Fuck you, how's that?

49:07.236 --> 49:10.155
- I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!
- Your country, my ass!

49:10.364 --> 49:13.825
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

49:14.368 --> 49:15.452
You no problem!

49:15.661 --> 49:18.330
Mike, do you have to be so combative?

49:18.539 --> 49:20.040
Fucking!

49:20.708 --> 49:22.375
You calling me a bitch?

49:24.879 --> 49:26.046
Do or die, man!

49:26.297 --> 49:29.341
A bullet in the head will
really mess up your extensions.

49:29.550 --> 49:32.177
Take your bullet and eat that shit, man.

49:32.386 --> 49:33.970
How about that?

49:38.893 --> 49:40.268
What the?

49:49.654 --> 49:51.071
Sir, we just wanna talk.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.823
You wanna talk? Well, go ahead.
Go ahead.

49:54.033 --> 49:55.575
We're not Immigration.

49:55.785 --> 49:58.912
They can't hear you because
they're still shooting at you.

49:59.830 --> 50:03.124
Fucking Haitians in
a fucking little-ass room...

50:03.334 --> 50:05.877
with fucking guns. Shit!

50:18.265 --> 50:21.434
Got to make it home to my babies.
Damn, now.

50:28.567 --> 50:31.069
Motherfucker! You killed my brother!

50:35.032 --> 50:36.574
That's a bitch!

50:37.827 --> 50:39.786
Shoot them. Fucking shoot them.

50:43.624 --> 50:45.583
They shot me. They got me, man. Yo!

50:59.807 --> 51:00.974
Got you.

51:04.770 --> 51:06.896
Oh, shit! Motherfucker!

51:07.106 --> 51:08.314
They killed the boy!

51:08.524 --> 51:09.733
They kill me!

51:09.942 --> 51:11.651
They're killing everybody!

51:13.154 --> 51:14.654
Motherfucker!

51:19.744 --> 51:21.161
My eyes!

51:21.495 --> 51:23.163
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

51:28.127 --> 51:29.669
Come. Come kill me, motherfucker.

51:30.004 --> 51:31.963
Come. You don't take me alive.

51:32.173 --> 51:34.090
You got three seconds
to drop your weapon!

51:34.300 --> 51:35.759
I got a present for you!

51:36.260 --> 51:37.927
- A nice present for you!
- One!

51:39.680 --> 51:41.639
- Two!
- I'm gonna kill you.

51:50.149 --> 51:52.525
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, man.
Don't kill me.

51:56.197 --> 51:59.491
- Bullets and all Excuse me.
- You all right, man?

52:01.952 --> 52:05.163
Apologise to that man.
Apologise to that man.

52:05.372 --> 52:07.665
Apologise! Apologise.

52:08.542 --> 52:10.293
Hey, listen, I owe you

52:10.503 --> 52:13.171
It's just that, you know,
you was disrespect

52:13.380 --> 52:16.174
But that don't mean it give me
the right, though. It don't.

52:16.383 --> 52:17.842
Excuse me.

52:19.053 --> 52:20.887
Whoosah, motherfucker!

52:24.225 --> 52:27.352
See, the interesting thing is he's
the one of us that's not pissed off.

52:27.561 --> 52:30.313
- I don't know nothing.
- I didn't ask you no question yet!

52:30.523 --> 52:32.023
- I don't know nothing.
- Lying already?

52:32.233 --> 52:34.317
- No, get
- How'd you know about the drop?

52:34.527 --> 52:36.319
- I don't know nothing!
- Stop lying!

52:36.529 --> 52:37.987
Do you know anything?

52:38.489 --> 52:41.157
I'm gonna be nice about it.
Do you know anything?

52:41.575 --> 52:43.326
Let's ask some other suspects.

52:43.536 --> 52:46.746
- Hey, look, man, fuck it.
- Let's try this. Let's talk to his homeys.

52:47.748 --> 52:49.457
Hey, look here, man.

52:49.667 --> 52:53.419
Can you tell me who was driving
the black Suburban?

52:54.713 --> 52:56.631
Oh, he don't know nothing.

52:56.841 --> 52:59.092
His brains is under the end table.

53:02.179 --> 53:03.972
He can't tell us shit, Mike.

53:04.181 --> 53:06.724
- He's all fucked up.
- What's your point?

53:07.101 --> 53:09.352
Dead suspects can't say shit.

53:09.562 --> 53:13.565
It seems like live suspects don't say
shit either, so I'll hot this dude here.

53:13.774 --> 53:15.900
- Save us the paperwork.
- I don't know nothing!

53:16.110 --> 53:19.279
I don't do motherfucking surveillance,
man. He do surveillance.

53:19.488 --> 53:21.781
He don't let nobody touch his camera.

53:23.325 --> 53:27.120
- What's on that camera?
- Trigger Mike strikes again.

53:27.997 --> 53:29.914
Hi, welcome to Phat's.
How can I help you?

53:30.332 --> 53:33.042
- Miami P.D.
- Whoa, Cops. I love that show.

53:33.294 --> 53:35.712
- We need to see what's on this video.
- Absolutely.

53:35.921 --> 53:39.507
You got a little bullet hole in there.
You guys tell me about it?

53:40.384 --> 53:43.094
Guess not. We'll put this
in our central floor model.

53:43.304 --> 53:45.597
It has kick-ass bass.
You like hip-hop? I love it.

53:45.806 --> 53:49.517
We freestyle in the break room. If you
guys ever wanna kick it, we'll flow.

53:49.935 --> 53:53.271
We're gonna set you up on
the wide-screen. Correct ratio.

53:53.522 --> 53:55.148
There you go.

53:58.152 --> 54:00.737
"Spanish Palms Mortuary."

54:00.946 --> 54:04.782
Why would they be doing
surveillance at a funeral home?

54:05.326 --> 54:06.659
Is that a Cuban flag?

54:07.286 --> 54:08.745
Right there. See the gun?

54:08.954 --> 54:12.957
Never knew guards at funeral homes
needed to carry them kind of weapons.

54:16.211 --> 54:18.212
It just seems like
we should turn it off...

54:18.422 --> 54:19.964
because my dad owns the store.

54:20.507 --> 54:21.799
She got a tongue ring.

54:23.886 --> 54:26.596
- This is like a porno. We're not
- Dude. Dude.

54:26.805 --> 54:28.139
- All right?
- Yeah.

54:30.017 --> 54:31.392
Okay. Okay.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.978
It's just, you know, my dad's gonna be

54:34.188 --> 54:35.730
I just need to I think I

54:35.940 --> 54:37.982
- I think I screwed this up.
- Relax.

54:39.401 --> 54:42.737
- My dad's gonna This is like a porno.
- Oh, yeah. I want more.

54:45.991 --> 54:48.076
- Okay.
- This is official police business.

54:48.827 --> 54:51.162
- What the fuck's going on here?
- Out of my way.

54:51.372 --> 54:54.207
My dad is coming.
My dad is coming. My dad is coming.

54:54.500 --> 54:56.960
What the hell is going on in my store?

54:57.419 --> 55:00.964
Son, how did this porno crap get
on my videos in my store?

55:01.548 --> 55:03.967
What the hell is going on in here?

55:06.011 --> 55:09.055
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right, Mike.

55:09.390 --> 55:13.267
Three days of this shit.
Got my nerves all rattled.

55:17.106 --> 55:18.856
My ass still hurts...

55:19.608 --> 55:22.110
from what you did to it the other night.

55:22.486 --> 55:23.820
Oh, my Lord.

55:24.446 --> 55:26.114
Yeah, it got rough.

55:26.949 --> 55:27.991
You know?

55:28.200 --> 55:32.078
I mean, we got caught up
in the moment, shit got crazy.

55:32.329 --> 55:33.413
You know how I get.

55:36.417 --> 55:40.003
When you popped me from behind,
I think you damaged some nerves.

55:40.587 --> 55:41.629
Okay.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.090
Now, I can't

55:44.967 --> 55:47.135
I can't Now, I can't...

55:48.303 --> 55:51.514
- Can't what?
- I can't even get an erection.

55:51.932 --> 55:53.850
What's an erection?

55:54.059 --> 55:57.937
I tried taking Viagra, you know,
pop one, pop two.

55:58.188 --> 55:59.981
Been eating them like Skittles.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.859
That poor man is pouring out his heart.

56:03.694 --> 56:05.695
And I'm still flaccid.

56:06.196 --> 56:08.698
Okay. I'm comfortable talking to you...

56:08.907 --> 56:10.992
It's got 5. 1 Dolby.

56:11.201 --> 56:14.287
...about what I did to your ass...

56:14.955 --> 56:17.248
but you not getting an erection...

56:18.208 --> 56:20.251
that's a real problem for me.

56:20.461 --> 56:22.920
- I just figured I could talk to you.
- Yeah. No, no.

56:23.130 --> 56:27.467
We're We partners, but we are
partners with boundaries.

56:28.427 --> 56:29.886
We got a new rule.

56:30.137 --> 56:34.057
From now on you can't say
the word "flaccid" to me.

56:34.558 --> 56:36.142
He's a mean fuck.

56:36.351 --> 56:38.644
Look here.
This is our little boundary box.

56:38.854 --> 56:40.688
So we gonna take the word "flaccid"...

56:40.898 --> 56:43.608
and we're gonna put it in there
with my mom's titties...

56:43.817 --> 56:47.070
with your erection problems,
and we're gonna close this box...

56:47.279 --> 56:49.363
and we're gonna throw
this bitch in the ocean.

56:49.573 --> 56:52.617
And the only way that you can
get to this box...

56:52.826 --> 56:55.745
is you got to be motherfucking
Jacques Cousteau.

56:55.996 --> 56:57.580
We cool?

57:02.127 --> 57:03.503
No...

57:04.838 --> 57:06.839
Oh, shit.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.092
We gotta go.

57:09.676 --> 57:12.637
In front of my babies you got porno
and homo shows up in here?

57:12.846 --> 57:15.014
What kind of freak-ass store is this?

57:16.100 --> 57:18.810
And you two motherfuckers need Jesus.

57:19.144 --> 57:20.645
Cover your ears, baby.

57:22.064 --> 57:24.273
Palm Mortuary, owned by an offshore
holding company...

57:24.483 --> 57:26.442
which, after 17 layers of bullshit...

57:26.652 --> 57:29.821
turns out to be registered
to Donna Maria Tapia...

57:30.072 --> 57:33.741
mother of Hector Juan Carlos Tapia,
who calls himself Johnny.

57:33.951 --> 57:36.077
Johnny Tapia. Shit.

57:36.286 --> 57:38.329
Every time the P.D. goes after him...

57:38.539 --> 57:41.707
he sues for wrongful arrest.
And, oh, does he win.

57:41.917 --> 57:44.502
Look. Last year,
he was awarded $9 million.

57:44.753 --> 57:47.755
And got a dozen dumb-ass officers
like you fired.

57:47.965 --> 57:50.007
Well, he hasn't run across us yet.

57:50.217 --> 57:52.510
We'd love to hear what's going on
in that house.

57:52.719 --> 57:55.138
Use your computer brain
and tap the phone.

57:57.766 --> 58:01.644
Well, that happens to be
highly illegal without a judge.

58:03.105 --> 58:07.400
We were thinking of something more
along the lines of a training operation.

58:07.609 --> 58:08.860
No, I can't do that.

58:09.069 --> 58:11.571
- Get you tickets to the Heat game.
- I need floor seats.

58:11.780 --> 58:14.157
With thick-ass glasses
you don't need floor seats.

58:14.366 --> 58:16.159
He can see the game
from the parking lot.

58:16.368 --> 58:20.079
- I can't work under these conditions.
- Floor seats to the Heat. You got it.

58:20.289 --> 58:22.582
- Lakers.
- Yes, Lakers.

58:22.791 --> 58:24.458
Okay. Watch me work.

58:36.305 --> 58:38.472
Hello? Is this the pest control?

58:38.682 --> 58:41.309
Yeah. We got a fucking problem.

58:41.518 --> 58:42.894
You know where we live.

58:43.103 --> 58:44.145
- Yeah, South Miami.
- We got it.

58:46.106 --> 58:47.148
Got our way in.

58:47.357 --> 58:49.233
- Illegally?
- You gotta put a word to it.

58:49.443 --> 58:50.526
It's like, secret.

58:51.111 --> 58:52.445
So, y'all wanna kill roaches?

58:52.654 --> 58:55.406
- Illegal.
- We'll plant a couple gypsy wires...

58:55.616 --> 58:57.033
find out what Tapia's up to.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.493
These are your basic household bugs.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.078
Dog, this is what we do.

59:05.167 --> 59:07.668
- What's the sprayers for?
- The roaches.

59:07.878 --> 59:11.255
- Roaches? We got rats.
- Say what?

59:11.465 --> 59:13.633
That's not an issue. We can handle that.

59:13.842 --> 59:17.011
We'll just have to slightly adjust
our approach a little bit.

59:17.512 --> 59:20.097
Nope. Nope. I don't mess with no rats.

59:20.307 --> 59:22.225
Hey. Stop it.

59:22.434 --> 59:25.895
- We're in. Get your head right.
- Mike, I'm a grown-ass man.

59:26.104 --> 59:28.731
Get your grown-ass self together
and let's do this.

59:30.651 --> 59:32.401
This is a beautiful house
you got here, sir.

59:32.611 --> 59:34.195
Well, start looking.

59:35.656 --> 59:36.864
They're all over.

59:44.373 --> 59:45.581
Those ain't normal rats.

59:45.791 --> 59:48.542
What he means is that they're
obviously a special breed.

59:48.752 --> 59:51.254
- What kind of breed are they?
- Big motherfuckers.

59:51.713 --> 59:53.839
Disposing of the rats isn't a problem.

59:54.049 --> 59:56.884
But we should ensure there's no
breeding elsewhere in the house.

59:57.094 --> 59:58.803
Yeah, at Zook...

59:59.012 --> 01:00:02.098
we like to work from the outside in,
you know.

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:05.017
So we gonna leave these Excuse me.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:07.687
We'll leave these here
and send in a special unit.

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:10.147
It'd be better to begin
in the rest of the house.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.066
You're not getting
in the rest of the house.

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:14.151
We won't be able to guarantee our work.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:16.696
The only thing that we can guarantee...

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:19.615
is that these rats will keep fucking.

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:22.410
Giving off offspring
until we find the colony.

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:24.704
Rats don't got no stinking colony.

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:26.706
Well, actually these are colonial rats.

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:30.126
What they do is they send out
worker rats that are called...

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:32.128
Marsupials.

01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:34.046
Marsupials.

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:38.426
These drones, they're explorers
of the rat world, you know.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.554
They just looking for rat pussy.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.391
- You know.
- Are you fucking with me?

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.269
Hold on. You called us. We can leave.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:51.856
But what you should understand is
that these rats will hump twice a day.

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:55.109
All right. Down there. Just kill them
and bring me the bill.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:00.698
That's that bullshit.
That's that bullshit right there.

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.575
- You see these rats?
- Plant your wires.

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:05.328
- You're not leaving me with them.
- Plant your wires.

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:09.874
Gentlemen. Alexei, Josef.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:13.919
Oh, I really like that word, Johnny.
"Gentlemen."

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:17.715
I'm just trying being civil.
This is business, we can all relax.

01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:20.343
- Alexei, would you like a Cohiba?
- Why not?

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:23.012
Of course. And you? Josef.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:25.806
I'm told you're
quite a wine connoisseur.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.058
I am.

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:32.396
Carlos, have Josef pick a wine and
Alexei and I will have a cigar. Come.

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:41.572
- Where the fuck you going?
- Pretty bad problem you got here.

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:45.076
I'm gonna head down to the truck,
get some poison pellets and stuff.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:47.119
Come straight back. No screwing around.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:52.500
They're all over.

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:55.461
Nice place you got here.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:02:01.384
It's Mama's, and it's a shithole.
Built a fucking million years ago.

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:04.136
- Expensive shithole, eh?
- Oh, no.

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:08.265
My new place,
the one I'm building in Cuba.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:13.062
Almost finished. Everything fucking
shiny new. Come on upstairs.

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:15.815
Oh, shit.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:19.693
Oh, shit! Look at the balls
on that motherfucker.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:01.152
Roberto...

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:05.156
- the general's office camera is out.
- Everything in this house is broken.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:14.081
My wire's planted.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.500
- How about yours?
- Almost got three wires planted.

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:23.591
Mike!

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:28.137
There's a papa rat humping
the shit out of this mama rat.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:30.806
No, he's straight pile-driving her!

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:34.101
Now, how is that information
gonna help me do my job?

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:36.353
They fuck just like us.

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.314
Where's the pest guy?

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.958
There's something going on down here.

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:15.184
Goddamn rats.

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:18.812
Yeah, they everywhere.
Just like cockroaches.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:20.981
No disrespect...

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:25.319
but I do not wish to talk business
until my partner return.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:29.490
It's baffling. You secretly decide to pay
me less and you talk about respect?

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.619
Let's wait for Josef. You know,
me and digits.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.789
Carlos, could you bring Josef in?

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:52.471
So...

01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:57.059
your partner is here.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.105
Would you like to talk now?

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:05.401
Carlos, another box.

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:13.284
So, you sign over ownership papers
for all the Florida clubs you own...

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:15.369
and I will control everything...

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:17.997
from point of origin to sale. Okay?

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:21.709
No middleman.
Especially Russian middleman.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.503
With all due respect, Mr. Tapia...

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:28.841
in my country,
I see such things all the time.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.843
I'm sorry for your country.

01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:34.763
That must be some Cuban stupid
tradition to put them in a tortilla bin.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:37.474
Now, listen to me, you Russian punk.

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:42.438
I, me, Johnny Tapia,
will sever your head off!

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:45.983
You kill me,
and you will have a shit-storm.

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:53.407
Should I screw your young wife...

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:56.827
or visit your son, the soccer player?

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.998
My daughter knows your son.

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:14.637
- You're gonna regret this.
- I hope that we can remain friends.

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:18.098
Because at the end, what else
do we have but friendship, trust...

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.017
honour?

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:25.898
Without this,
we are no more than beasts.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:41.497
The kitchen monitor's out.

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:43.749
What the hell's going on out there?

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.504
Shit.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:51.715
I found something.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:07:00.140
- It's a guy's finger.
- What, did the rats eat the rest of him?

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:04.728
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey, I was just looking for you.

01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:06.939
I think I figured out your problem.

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.024
Y'all a bunch of filthy motherfuckers.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:12.528
Blow out!

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:14.947
- What's going on? Shit!
- Get out of the house!

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:21.662
This shit's got to stop.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.588
Fuck!

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:33.507
We should go.

01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:38.595
Go! Go!

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.431
Just another day with Mike Lowrey.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.231
- Damn! Go!
- Come on!

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.908
Roberto thinks they were
the gangbangers...

01:08:00.118 --> 01:08:02.077
that tried to hijack the drop, boss.

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:06.790
How did this thing happen?

01:08:09.169 --> 01:08:13.380
I don't know. We called the rat people
and these guys showed up.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.424
Maybe you're the rat, huh?

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:20.636
They tried to steal from me,
and you let them into my mother's house.

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:22.890
Johnny. Hey, no.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.850
I would never...

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:30.189
Nobody puts in danger
my daughter, my mother...

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.274
or my money.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:39.740
Send him to the mortuary.

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:43.868
Johnny. Johnny,
what happened to Roberto?

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.537
He killed himself, Mama.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:52.169
- Very sad.
- Write a nice letter to his mother.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:53.754
I'll do it.

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:55.546
Okay. Bye.

01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:00.803
- Yo, run the print.
- Mike, stop playing, man!

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.680
- Run the print.
- Don't touch me with no dead finger.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:08.560
Excuse me, run this print.
I need to find the owner.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.187
Thank you.

01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:12.773
Think you can find out
what's on these shreds?

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.316
Of course.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.862
We're thinking about ordering lunch.

01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:23.075
Should we put you down for some extra
crispy and a couple of grape sodas?

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:26.036
"Couple of grape sodas."

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:29.540
- Very funny. That's hilarious.
- Isn't it low tide?

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:30.791
I think it is.

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.169
- Don't you have relatives to pick up?
- What?

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:37.548
Yo, now you crossed the line, man.
Okay, no, that's not funny.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:41.093
We're fucking with you. We planted
wires, we need some help. No bullshit.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.930
I want you...

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:51.728
to find out...

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:55.274
who those two black puta de mierda are.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:59.570
And I want them lying right here...

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:04.116
in Mama's garden in these coffins!

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:08.412
And our mystery finger belongs to:

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:10.831
Josef Kuninskavich.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.625
Oh, man. He was a lieutenant
in the Russian mob.

01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:16.420
Owned a couple dozen Florida nightclubs.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:19.131
Tapia's starting to knock off
Russian mob bosses.

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:22.926
Got something.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:24.595
What you got, dickhead?

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:27.431
The computer matches half tones,
grey tones, densities.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.100
Sort of like a visual code-breaking.

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:32.311
Little something I put together.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:37.065
The shredded papers was a photo.
Some kind of boat. "Dixie 7."

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:38.317
Dixie 7.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:43.530
- It's registered to a one Floyd Poteet.
- Poteet brothers.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.493
One of the KKK guys we busted.
You blew his ear off, remember?

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:51.121
Mike, can you teach me
how to shoot people?

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:54.416
Listen to what we got at Tapia's.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:03.467
The second-in-command is talking.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:08.138
He's telling him, "Yes, boss.
We found a bunch of fat doe fuckers...

01:11:08.348 --> 01:11:11.350
- and we're getting them emptied."
- "Fat does emptied"?

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:14.645
- The hell does that mean?
- He has a meeting this afternoon.

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:18.982
- You know who I am?
- Name sounds familiar.

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:21.234
Sense of humour. I like that.

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:24.780
Meet me on the sand, 2:00, Shore Club.

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:28.492
- She has no idea. Let's roll.
- Y'all come with us.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.504
I ordered a couple of Bacardi Mojitos.

01:11:45.677 --> 01:11:47.010
Miami.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:52.516
Okay, zoom in on nine.
A little more audio, please.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:55.852
So why don't we take a swim? Cool off.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:00.857
Or we could just stay here
and get drunk. How about that?

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:03.151
Or we could drink this later.

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:05.153
Unless you have a reason...

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:09.241
why you don't want to get
that beautiful body of yours wet.

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:12.577
Why not just ask if I'm wearing a wire?

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:16.164
I'd rather go swimming.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.796
- What the hell's he doing?
- Son of a bitch.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:25.549
Shit. He's taking her into the water.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:39.521
This guy's smart.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:45.444
I want you to work for me. Why waste
time on this unnecessary talking?

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:49.406
It's very unnecessary.
What do you need with another banker?

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:53.285
For the same reason
as your previous employer.

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:57.247
But now I own all the Russian clubs.
No middleman.

01:12:57.457 --> 01:13:00.167
You know, I'm about to be
the biggest importer...

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:02.878
and distributor
of ecstasy in North America.

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:05.464
You're gonna be a very rich young woman.

01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:07.007
That's why I thought

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.885
I know what you thought, Mr. Tapia.

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:12.554
As long as you don't think it
more than once...

01:13:12.764 --> 01:13:15.182
I'm happy to be in business with you.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:17.893
All right.

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:19.895
Let's do business.

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:33.492
What are you, a cop or a model?

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:34.993
What you talking about, man?

01:13:35.203 --> 01:13:37.204
Threw something on.
I like looking good. What?

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:38.747
For who?

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:41.374
Hey, don't hate the player.
Hate the game.

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:42.959
I hate the tailor.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.630
Good job. We'll get him.

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:51.426
Your brother would love to talk
to you down the street.

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.428
Whoa, what's going on?

01:13:58.017 --> 01:14:00.102
You trying to blow my case
or you just insane?

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:02.896
You're the one taking a dip
with the Cubano maniac.

01:14:04.816 --> 01:14:07.025
- How'd you know that?
- We had a wire in the house.

01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:10.987
- You two have a warrant for that wire?
- Look, fuck that, okay?

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:13.949
You don't know the kind of danger
that you're in, Syd.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:18.453
I am fully aware, and I am fully capable
of what I am doing.

01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:20.288
I am not your baby sister anymore.

01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:22.499
For the DEA,
you ain't nothing but a honeypot.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:23.792
What'd you just say?

01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:27.671
That's why you got the job, because
you look good in a bathing suit.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.465
All right, let's sit down somewhere.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:36.096
All right, look, Syd, there's
some shit you need to know.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:39.891
Johnny Tapia is cutting up Russian
mob bosses in his mom's kitchen.

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:41.476
In the kitchen, Syd.

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:43.895
He found a severed finger
by the crock pot.

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:46.815
You're about to be in the middle
of a drug war.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:51.361
Miami P.D. has arrested this guy
12 times with no convictions.

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:54.114
Why don't you just hang back
and let us bring him down?

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.908
Guys, look, I need this, okay?
And I am this close.

01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:58.160
What's "this close"?

01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:01.163
I'm in charge of money laundering
for his entire operation.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:04.749
In a month or two, we'll have enough
for a conviction, and it'll be over.

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:06.543
What about a day or two? Sound better?

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:10.130
Marcus and I think we found the key
to Tapia's whole operation.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.090
You have nothing to say now, huh?

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:16.136
- Just stuck, right?
- Okay, time-out, y'all. Damn.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.180
We got this peckerwood
that'll put us down...

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:21.933
with the transport end of Tapia's
operation. Do you want in?

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:23.143
- Why would you?
- When?

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:24.728
- Tonight.
- Page me.

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:26.855
Should I bring my thong?

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:31.943
Get your bitch hands off.
I'll knock you the fuck out.

01:15:33.237 --> 01:15:36.198
Mike, we're trying to keep her
out of trouble, man...

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:38.241
not invite her in.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:40.952
Man, I just figured, you know,
if she with us...

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:44.247
that's just less trouble
she could get into.

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:48.627
I'm gonna keep it real with you too, man.
I think she can handle herself.

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:52.130
I'm gonna keep it real with you.
Don't nobody know my sister like I do.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.425
Okay? She doesn't
make good choices, Mike.

01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:58.470
- She's not street-smart.
- Doesn't make good?

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:00.889
- Like, what kind of choices?
- Men, for one.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.808
She's attracted to these dumb...

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:08.355
flashy, just musclebound dickheads,
Mike. You know?

01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:14.361
Cock diesel motherfuckers that can't
even fucking turn to wipe their ass.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.029
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:19.699
You know?
Just dumb as a bucket of shrimp.

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:23.286
Yeah. Yeah. That shit's crazy.

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:26.122
I mean, you don't think maybe you

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:29.251
Maybe you didn't, like,
get a chance to know any of them?

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.419
I'm gonna give the next one a chance.

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:34.589
A chance to whup his ass.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:38.176
- Whup the shit out of him.
- Oh, you gonna fight him?

01:16:38.386 --> 01:16:40.887
What I'm gonna do
ain't even gonna be legal.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:43.807
I might be up in here
with these motherfuckers.

01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:46.142
Do you know what I mean?

01:16:47.395 --> 01:16:48.895
The fuck you looking at?

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:50.230
Thank you kindly.

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:54.693
- Who sprung me?
- Hey, Cousin Floyd.

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:56.236
- Oh, you.
- Remember me?

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:02.200
Cheese.

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:04.327
Y'all look great together.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:06.746
- What the fuck you doing?
- Just a little insurance.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.748
You gonna help us find Dixie 7...

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.418
and tell us what that boat
has to do with Johnny Tapia.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:14.462
- I ain't no snitch.
- Oh, you ain't no snitch?

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:18.466
- Oh, damn. That's a shame.
- Know what I'm gonna do?

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:23.555
I'm gonna send a special 8 x 10
to his KKK buddies back in jail.

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:25.640
You know what, it's a digital photo too.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:28.560
So we can do
whatever we want to do with it.

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:30.312
By the time we get done with you...

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:32.981
you gonna be in the next
Busta Rhymes video on BET.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.816
Tuck ass.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.028
I got my rights.

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:41.573
I'm worried.
There's too much heat around in Miami.

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:44.659
I can feel it. I can feel it.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:49.706
We need to put my money in coffins
to Cuba faster.

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:53.043
You should tell the mortuary
to speed things up. All right?

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:04.554
That's the channel marker way out there.

01:18:04.764 --> 01:18:09.476
They make the drop mostly at dawn,
but there'll be one today, though.

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:17.859
Syd, you talk to Mama? She's got hives.

01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:21.654
Oh, and I told Mama
about your Cubano boyfriend.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:23.531
He ain't invited to Christmas dinner.

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:26.743
Change the station.
More music, less Marcus.

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:31.873
If you open the door, he'll be a black
Dr. Phil for the next 40 minutes.

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:36.169
Syd, you might not wanna get
too flirty with Mike.

01:18:36.379 --> 01:18:39.381
Your boyfriend might cut off
his trigger finger.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.135
Maybe Mike's been flirting with me.
Did you ever think about that?

01:18:47.098 --> 01:18:48.139
Trigger Mike?

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:50.433
Not like this. Don't play with that boy.

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:53.812
- Seriously. Don't play with that boy.
- Just tell him about New York.

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:55.688
- Do it.
- Tell me what?

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:57.941
Oh, shit. Is he walking down the steps?

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:01.236
Oh, shit. He coming down.

01:19:01.445 --> 01:19:04.114
- It's okay.
- Yeah, you done fucked up.

01:19:04.407 --> 01:19:06.366
You done fucked up.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:09.202
You remember...

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:11.246
Remember I went to New York?
You remember?

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:13.373
And...

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.208
I said, "Syd."

01:19:15.543 --> 01:19:16.876
I ran in

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:20.588
Syd ran into me in New York
on the street in that place.

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:22.715
And I said:

01:19:23.134 --> 01:19:24.217
"What's up?"

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:27.262
And we was hungry, so then...

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:29.806
she had fish.

01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:32.851
It was grouper.

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:35.895
And then I had some chicken.

01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:38.982
Remember, I was supposed to come home?

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:40.775
But I didn't.

01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:43.069
We went out on a date.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:47.031
Five, actually.
Now we're seeing each other.

01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:49.909
Hold up.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:53.997
You know, really out of respect
for you, Marcus, nothing happened.

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:57.208
Hey, Mike, why you tripping, man?

01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:59.794
I mean, we wanted to make sure
you was cool with it.

01:20:00.004 --> 01:20:03.756
Doesn't matter what I think, you know.
Hey, I had to find out like this, right?

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:05.175
Don't matter.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:09.387
Let me ask you, y'all gonna have babies?
Little bunch of mini Mikes?

01:20:09.597 --> 01:20:11.598
Bunch of little lying, violent
motherfuckers?

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.600
Marcus, nothing happened.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.894
I just wanna say,
Mama's gonna be thrilled.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:19.355
All right, you know what, you need to
"whoosah" or something for a second.

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:21.524
Hey, here comes the Dixie 7.

01:20:26.197 --> 01:20:27.280
Just leave it alone.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:30.408
- Why you acting like that?
- Go on about your business, man.

01:20:30.618 --> 01:20:32.994
- We gonna talk about this.
- No. Get out of my face.

01:20:33.204 --> 01:20:36.206
- I'm trying to talk to you.
- Get the fuck off me, Mike.

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:40.168
What the hell is your problem, man?
Why you acting so stupid?

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:43.505
This is a dysfunctional partnership.
That's why I'm acting like that.

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:45.131
- You know
- There ain't no trust.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:46.591
I didn't lie to you!

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.927
I was waiting
for the right time to tell you.

01:20:49.136 --> 01:20:50.136
But that ain't your issue.

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:53.473
Why don't you bring it to me real.
What is your problem with this?

01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:56.434
You know what? You a dog, man.

01:20:56.644 --> 01:20:59.812
- That's it. There it is. I said it.
- Oh, okay.

01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:03.316
You like a pit bull with that little
pink thing hanging out.

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:07.237
Oh, it's like that. Oh, okay.

01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:10.990
I'm not good enough for your sister.

01:21:12.493 --> 01:21:14.661
Guys, enough. The boat's coming.

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:19.624
Okay. We gonna handle that shit.
Go ahead, man.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.880
In about an hour,
the drop boat's gonna come.

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:43.815
We got them.

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:48.278
Wonder what mortuary
that coffin's going to.

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:03.042
Keep going straight by.

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:10.883
You seeing what I'm seeing?

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:19.642
Get the load to the mortuary
and don't screw up.

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:21.060
I got it.

01:22:21.812 --> 01:22:22.854
Load up.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.200
They're getting away!

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.952
Stop! Stop!

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:40.038
We need your car. All right?

01:22:40.331 --> 01:22:42.832
- Get out the car.
- Can't you get a better car than that?

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:45.001
Let that man go!

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:48.004
- Don't be coming at me with that tone.
- Freak.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:51.466
- Small cars don't hurt the ozone layer.
- That's what I'm talking about.

01:22:51.675 --> 01:22:53.426
- Stop the car.
- Get Yeah.

01:22:53.636 --> 01:22:56.471
- Pop the trunk. Get out. Get in.
- Get out. Get out.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.723
- Get your ass in.
- Okay.

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:01.934
- I am in the middle of a sale.
- Do I have to pull my gun?

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:05.897
Oh, shit. Dan Marino. What's up?
Back up, Dan. Hey, you're the truth.

01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:08.316
- Whatever you need, officers.
- That's Dan Marino.

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:11.027
- Hey. Back up.
- Let me know how it rides.

01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:13.446
He's gonna test-drive the shit out this.

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:15.323
Go. I don't wanna blow my cover.

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:22.080
Got them. Got them right there.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:37.970
Why you gotta get so close?

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.015
- I won't let that coffin get away.
- But they're all around us.

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:42.725
Shit, those are the gangbangers.

01:23:42.935 --> 01:23:44.811
Relax, they don't know us.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:47.939
Boss, we got a problem here.
We're being followed.

01:23:48.732 --> 01:23:50.650
This is a big problem, Carlos.

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:56.114
- Sorry, boss. I'll take care of it, okay?
- Kill those black bitches. All right?

01:23:56.407 --> 01:23:58.783
They made us. Get some
undercovers to roll with us.

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:02.578
We're splitting up. Everybody
go to Third and Boxter, now!

01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:06.708
Here we go.

01:24:17.094 --> 01:24:19.762
I didn't sign up for no
goddamned car chase!

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.610
Have you lost your mind?

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:42.952
I see you got your mind set on doing
dumb shit, so please let me out!

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:54.672
I seen this in a movie once.
They didn't make it!

01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:56.716
Mike.

01:24:57.968 --> 01:24:59.010
Oh, shit!

01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:08.978
- Dump truck!
- I got it.

01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:12.815
- Mike!
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:17.361
Mike, whoa.

01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:19.405
Right there! Oh, shit, Mike!

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:21.657
- Did you see that shit?
- No shit.

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:32.668
Dan Marino should definitely
buy this car.

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:37.298
Not this one. I'm fucking this one up.
But definitely one like this.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:40.426
I almost missed that.

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:45.181
All right, that was almost fucked up.
I almost fucked up.

01:25:47.518 --> 01:25:48.684
Shit!

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:51.646
This is not necessary.

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:02.698
Oh, shit!

01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:08.871
- Damn!
- Dead man on the hood! Dead man!

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:10.748
- I'm trying to get it off.
- Get it off!

01:26:10.958 --> 01:26:12.124
I'm trying to get it off.

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:16.170
- That shit's nasty. That's nasty.
- Get it off! Get

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:17.839
That shit is nasty.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.987
- Undercover police! Move!
- Undercover police!

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:43.823
- Move!
- Move! Move! Move!

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:56.127
Coming around the corner!

01:26:56.503 --> 01:26:58.921
Get ready, they're coming
around the block. Move!

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:15.855
Up top!

01:27:23.614 --> 01:27:24.739
Shit!

01:27:24.948 --> 01:27:27.700
Boy, if this was my car, I'd be pissed!

01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:29.577
Get down! Get down!

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:37.126
Trying to break the world record
for gun fights in a week?

01:27:37.336 --> 01:27:39.378
This is not the time to criticise!

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:41.756
I can't work with you
blaming me all the time!

01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:45.426
- This is not your fault?
- This is not No! No!

01:27:45.636 --> 01:27:48.429
Bullshit, Mike! Everything's your fault!

01:27:56.939 --> 01:27:58.439
Okay, let's go! Let's go!

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:09.325
- Clear room!
- Cool!

01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:15.498
I'm going around!

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:22.004
- Mike, got him!
- They got the coffin.

01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:35.017
Move!

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.812
Move! Move! Get down! Police! Get down!

01:28:44.194 --> 01:28:45.236
Move! Move!

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:48.197
Police! Move! Move!

01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:50.032
Get out of my way! Move! Move!

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:51.659
Get down! Get down!

01:28:57.165 --> 01:29:00.167
Shit! Open the door! Police!

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:02.712
No!

01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:05.423
Whoa! Shit!

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:08.718
Mike! Mike!

01:29:22.566 --> 01:29:24.108
That boy bit me!

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.655
Mike!

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:46.547
Move! Move!

01:29:49.426 --> 01:29:50.885
Police! Move!

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:08.360
Police! Move!

01:30:12.157 --> 01:30:13.866
He under there?

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.744
We lost the coffin...

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:19.830
and you barbecued our only lead, Mike.

01:30:20.207 --> 01:30:24.126
This has got to be the worst, most
emotional cop-week of my life.

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:26.879
Yeah, it's been a little rough.

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:36.597
- Where were these bodies going?
- I don't know. It's really strange.

01:30:36.807 --> 01:30:38.891
All the John Does we found
out here are empty.

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.685
Empty Does. Fat Does.

01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:44.897
Cut them open, took the organs out.
Sewed them back up.

01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:47.191
Nice work.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.277
The more you guys fuck up,
the more we look like rock stars.

01:30:50.487 --> 01:30:53.114
The van you was chasing
is a transport for the city morgue.

01:30:53.323 --> 01:30:57.118
The John Does were being delivered
to the university for medical research.

01:30:57.327 --> 01:30:59.537
- Nice going.
- I can't believe you guys.

01:30:59.746 --> 01:31:02.373
Do you both wake up
in the morning, call each other up?

01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:04.291
"Good morning, Marcus." "Morning, Mike."

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:05.793
"How you doing?" "A'ight."

01:31:06.002 --> 01:31:08.921
"So how are we gonna fuck up
the captain's life today?"

01:31:09.131 --> 01:31:10.756
"Gee, I don't know." "I don't know."

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:13.092
"Ooh. Look, over there.

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:16.053
Let's kill three fat people...

01:31:16.263 --> 01:31:18.389
and leave them on the street."

01:31:18.598 --> 01:31:20.391
They were dead before we ran over them.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:24.603
It doesn't matter whether they
were dead or not, goddamn it!

01:31:24.855 --> 01:31:27.731
Every time you leave a corpse
on the street...

01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:32.987
I have to get these forensic coroner
guys to come to see what happened.

01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:36.824
Then I gotta get detectives.
See? They're detecting shit.

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:42.246
Then I gotta get these forensic guys
to stick them back in the fucking bag!

01:31:42.455 --> 01:31:44.623
Jesus Christ!

01:31:44.875 --> 01:31:46.876
You guys, you're like...

01:31:47.294 --> 01:31:50.546
You're like a bunch
of bloodsucking ticks...

01:31:50.881 --> 01:31:54.049
draining the life's blood
out of this department.

01:31:55.594 --> 01:31:57.970
Damn the "whoosah," captain.
Did you just call me a tick?

01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.346
I was referring to him.

01:31:59.556 --> 01:32:01.348
- Thought so.
- These aren't normal corpses.

01:32:01.558 --> 01:32:04.685
If I threw you out
of a speeding ice truck...

01:32:04.895 --> 01:32:07.938
and then ran over your head,
you wouldn't be normal either.

01:32:08.148 --> 01:32:11.108
Think about this for a second.
These bodies have been emptied...

01:32:11.318 --> 01:32:14.361
from a drug smuggler that just
happens to own a mortuary.

01:32:14.571 --> 01:32:17.406
I got a bunch of bodies waiting
with plenty of room in them...

01:32:17.616 --> 01:32:19.116
I could smuggle some shit.

01:32:19.326 --> 01:32:21.911
Johnny Tapia has the perfect cover.

01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:24.371
Johnny Tapia?

01:32:24.581 --> 01:32:27.041
I want a warrant to go
into his mortuaries immediately.

01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:29.126
No warrant. What? For what? For what?

01:32:29.336 --> 01:32:32.046
For a bunch of dead guys
on their way to med research?

01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:37.092
No. Every time we go after him,
he sues us and wins.

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:41.388
This shit stops now,
or they'll fire us, disband TNT...

01:32:41.598 --> 01:32:43.557
and stick me in a fucking coffin.

01:32:43.767 --> 01:32:46.894
- This is over now!
- What happened to "whatever it takes"?

01:32:47.103 --> 01:32:51.065
That was pre-vehicular manslaughter.
Not to mention Johnny Tapia

01:32:51.274 --> 01:32:53.692
- What the fuck is that?
- Oh, shit.

01:32:58.031 --> 01:33:01.575
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

01:33:01.785 --> 01:33:04.245
This man has violated my rights!

01:33:04.454 --> 01:33:05.829
Who the fuck is that?

01:33:06.206 --> 01:33:09.917
Running people over is not enough
for you? Now you're into kidnapping?

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:12.419
That man is a criminal. Okay?
We busted him at the

01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:14.755
Excuse me, I have so much brass
up my ass...

01:33:14.965 --> 01:33:17.383
I could be playing
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

01:33:18.969 --> 01:33:20.761
I ain't cut out for this, man.

01:33:21.137 --> 01:33:23.264
Come on, man. I can't do this
with you right now.

01:33:23.473 --> 01:33:27.476
- I'm re-evaluating what's important.
- About what? Being a cop?

01:33:27.686 --> 01:33:29.478
No, about you being my partner.

01:33:29.729 --> 01:33:32.773
Is this about Syd? God! Hey, Marcus, man

01:33:32.983 --> 01:33:35.859
That was messed up, but that
ain't what this is about, Mike.

01:33:36.069 --> 01:33:39.947
Once we nail Tapia,
you and me, we're over.

01:33:40.156 --> 01:33:42.157
I already signed my transfer papers.

01:33:48.873 --> 01:33:52.501
Megan, what's the name of this boy
taking you to the movies?

01:33:52.711 --> 01:33:53.794
Reggie.

01:33:54.004 --> 01:33:57.131
Daddy, please don't embarrass me
and ask him a lot of questions.

01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:00.050
Everybody knows you're a cop,
and it makes people nervous.

01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:02.845
Well, why nervous? He on crack?

01:34:05.849 --> 01:34:08.475
- It's cool?
- Yeah. Come in.

01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:10.185
What'd you?

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:12.229
I got a sneak and peek.

01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:15.149
Judge Sinclair said we can go
into the mortuary tonight.

01:34:15.358 --> 01:34:17.526
We can't touch nothing,
but if we find something...

01:34:17.736 --> 01:34:19.361
he'll give us a righteous warrant.

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:21.780
You love pissing Captain Howard off,
don't you?

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:23.532
It's what I do.

01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:26.368
So when you start playing golf?

01:34:27.037 --> 01:34:30.998
Hey, so you real serious about
this transfer thing, huh?

01:34:31.207 --> 01:34:34.752
I mean, you been quitting for 10 years.
I just always thought it was...

01:34:34.961 --> 01:34:36.545
how you dealt with all this shit.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:39.506
It's what's best for me and my family.

01:34:42.302 --> 01:34:44.386
Look, I'm gonna get my stuff, man.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:10.329
"We ride together, we die together.

01:35:10.789 --> 01:35:12.456
Bad boys for life."

01:35:13.583 --> 01:35:14.750
We getting old, Mike.

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:18.420
One of them young punks coming
to take my baby out on her first date.

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:25.427
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hi, Mr. Burnett. I'm Reggie.

01:35:26.096 --> 01:35:28.222
- What you doing here?
- I came to take out Megan.

01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:30.724
- What?
- I came to take out Megan.

01:35:30.934 --> 01:35:32.893
- How old are you?
- I'm 15, Mr. Burnett.

01:35:33.103 --> 01:35:34.812
Motherfucker, you look 30.

01:35:35.647 --> 01:35:37.564
- Show me some ID.
- I don't have none on me.

01:35:37.774 --> 01:35:40.734
You don't have no ID.
Get your ass up against that wall.

01:35:40.944 --> 01:35:42.069
What is your problem?

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:45.072
You think you know it all.
Little young Thundercats.

01:35:45.281 --> 01:35:46.407
- Got joints on you?
- No.

01:35:46.616 --> 01:35:48.117
- You smoke that shit?
- No, sir.

01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:50.911
You trying to get my daughter high?
Do you smoke that shit?

01:35:51.121 --> 01:35:53.122
- Nigga, who that is at the door?
- It's Reggie.

01:35:53.498 --> 01:35:56.542
- Who the fuck is Reggie?
- Came to take Megan out.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:00.254
- What you want, nigga?
- I'm here to take his daughter out.

01:36:00.463 --> 01:36:01.755
- What's your name?
- Reggie.

01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:03.924
I heard the motherfucker
say your name Reggie.

01:36:04.134 --> 01:36:05.217
You taking Megan out?

01:36:05.427 --> 01:36:06.802
- How old is you?
- Fifteen.

01:36:07.011 --> 01:36:09.096
- Shit, nigga, you at least 30.
- This is Mike.

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:10.597
- Can you fight?
- Yeah.

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:13.851
You can fight? Motherfucker.
You can't fight. Look at you

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.936
- Cut it out.
- I wanna know if

01:36:16.146 --> 01:36:19.106
When somebody taking my niece out,
I wanna know if he can fight.

01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:22.443
Somebody might come say something,
the nigga can't fight, she can't go.

01:36:22.652 --> 01:36:25.320
This is Megan's godfather, okay?
He just got out the joint.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:27.948
Why you putting all my business
in the street?

01:36:28.158 --> 01:36:31.201
- They call him
- I got out of jail. I ain't going back!

01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:32.619
I ain't going back!

01:36:32.829 --> 01:36:36.123
What's wrong with you? Acting scared.
You ain't seen a gun before?

01:36:36.332 --> 01:36:37.791
Stop pointing the gun at the boy.

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:40.627
Look, don't you disrespect me
in front of company.

01:36:40.837 --> 01:36:41.962
Let the gun go off.

01:36:42.172 --> 01:36:45.716
Nigga, you a big, tall, Ludacris-looking
motherfucker, ain't you?

01:36:45.925 --> 01:36:46.967
- You rap?
- No.

01:36:52.765 --> 01:36:53.891
Hey, Mike!

01:36:54.517 --> 01:36:57.227
Now, listen.
Have my daughter home at 10:01.

01:36:57.437 --> 01:37:00.397
If she ain't home at 10:01,
I'm in the car, okay?

01:37:00.607 --> 01:37:03.650
Lock, loaded and hunting
your motherfucking ass down.

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.069
- Do you hear me? Speak up.
- I'll go with him.

01:37:06.279 --> 01:37:09.239
If I'm there, know what it'll be?
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, nigga.

01:37:09.449 --> 01:37:11.033
- That's what it'll be.
- Marcus!

01:37:11.242 --> 01:37:15.287
Reggie, baby, I am so sorry.
Forgive Megan's dad and his silly friend.

01:37:15.538 --> 01:37:16.663
- You a virgin?
- Yes.

01:37:16.873 --> 01:37:19.208
Keep it that way.
Ain't gonna be no fucking tonight.

01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:22.169
Baby, the red shirt's nice.
You guys have a good time.

01:37:22.378 --> 01:37:24.129
- You ever made love to a man?
- No.

01:37:24.422 --> 01:37:26.048
- You want to?
- No, sir.

01:37:26.382 --> 01:37:28.759
- Hey, have a good time, baby.
- Go. Go.

01:37:28.968 --> 01:37:31.261
- All right.
- I need to go.

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:33.430
That was cool.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.724
So, you ready to bust this case open?

01:37:35.934 --> 01:37:38.227
Oh, yeah. Let's finish strong.
All right?

01:37:48.738 --> 01:37:52.199
All right, ladies. We cannot take
a burn tonight or Tapia walks.

01:37:52.408 --> 01:37:54.743
I need a good, clean break-in.

01:37:55.245 --> 01:37:58.080
- Zank, eyeball.
- Eyeball set.

01:37:58.289 --> 01:38:00.707
- Dex, high ground.
- Rooftop set.

01:38:00.917 --> 01:38:03.418
- Fanuti, light your crack pipe.
- Got you.

01:38:03.836 --> 01:38:04.920
Lockman, you buzzing?

01:38:06.172 --> 01:38:07.214
We're up, baby.

01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:20.018
- Hello, anybody home?
- We got a stiff to deliver!

01:38:23.106 --> 01:38:26.066
- What's going on here, man?
- We got a stiff to deliver.

01:38:26.276 --> 01:38:29.444
- Nobody told me about any stiff.
- The guy's in the van now. He's fresh.

01:38:29.654 --> 01:38:30.946
No deliveries tonight.

01:38:36.119 --> 01:38:39.371
They told us to come right over
to the place. This is the place.

01:38:40.498 --> 01:38:43.000
- We must bring him in here. I'm sorry.
- No one in.

01:38:43.209 --> 01:38:45.586
- You get that body to the morgue yet?
- Morgue?

01:38:45.795 --> 01:38:48.088
You said to get it to
the Spanish Palms Mortuary.

01:38:48.298 --> 01:38:49.756
No, you dumb Latin fuck.

01:38:49.966 --> 01:38:51.592
What you smoking in that crack pipe?

01:38:51.801 --> 01:38:53.468
Who you calling a Latin fuck, man?

01:38:57.515 --> 01:38:58.932
Check.

01:38:59.142 --> 01:39:01.143
There's burnt people down here, Mike.

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.354
Oh, fuck.

01:39:06.566 --> 01:39:08.650
Damn, somebody's teeth.

01:39:08.985 --> 01:39:11.528
Now that we're here, you need
to sign some paperwork...

01:39:11.738 --> 01:39:15.532
because the man is very contagious.
His contagiousness could touch you.

01:39:15.742 --> 01:39:17.618
You guys have a nice evening.
Good night.

01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:20.495
Might you see us inside
for some hot cocoa?

01:39:47.565 --> 01:39:51.276
Cam 1, I got a good signal.
Cam 2, I got a good signal.

01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:08.585
- Damn!
- Stop it. Do not do that tonight.

01:40:08.795 --> 01:40:10.837
- You don't smell that?
- Oh, yeah, I smell it.

01:40:11.047 --> 01:40:12.756
- It stinks.
- Stop!

01:40:14.717 --> 01:40:16.885
I'm gonna have some Pepto.

01:40:25.144 --> 01:40:28.021
- This dude hasn't been embalmed yet.
- What you talking about?

01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:32.567
They stick a tube down your throat
and just suck out all the gunk and bile.

01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:36.196
Because what happens is, your body will
get gaseous, and you'll decompose.

01:40:36.406 --> 01:40:38.699
Don't want that to happen
before your family see you.

01:40:38.908 --> 01:40:41.743
- I don't need to know that now.
- They sew your mouth closed.

01:40:41.953 --> 01:40:45.122
They got to get it all out because
a lot of times, dead people will fart.

01:40:45.623 --> 01:40:47.624
That shit will clear a funeral home out.

01:40:47.834 --> 01:40:49.167
How do you know all that?

01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:51.670
Learning Channel, man. That shit got me.

01:40:54.757 --> 01:40:56.258
Oh, shit.

01:41:01.639 --> 01:41:03.557
You're not even gonna warm up to it?

01:41:03.766 --> 01:41:06.101
Hey! Do some cop work.

01:41:06.477 --> 01:41:09.187
- He's a human being.
- Check the casket.

01:41:09.439 --> 01:41:12.149
Why don't you check his spine
while you're in there.

01:41:14.944 --> 01:41:16.153
I'm retching.

01:41:22.285 --> 01:41:23.493
Mike!

01:41:23.703 --> 01:41:25.620
- What?
- Have some dignity.

01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:27.956
- I ain't doing nothing.
- Cover her titties up.

01:41:28.166 --> 01:41:31.835
Like, what am I gonna do
with these big-ass dead titties?

01:41:32.044 --> 01:41:33.336
But you're looking, though.

01:41:33.546 --> 01:41:35.922
There's
Something's wrong with your brain.

01:41:36.132 --> 01:41:37.299
Just cover the titties.

01:41:37.717 --> 01:41:39.718
Goddamn!

01:41:41.137 --> 01:41:43.847
Damn. This nicer than some cribs.

01:41:44.474 --> 01:41:46.224
She's going to Cuba.

01:41:49.812 --> 01:41:52.022
Who's top cop now, huh?

01:41:52.231 --> 01:41:54.483
That's what I'm talking about. See?
There you go.

01:41:54.984 --> 01:41:58.236
That's it right there. Take a picture
of the money, then check this body.

01:41:59.238 --> 01:42:01.239
No, I'm gonna count these. You know?

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:02.449
Check the body.

01:42:02.658 --> 01:42:06.495
I'm gonna check the body, Mike.
I'm not rushing into it, that's all.

01:42:08.164 --> 01:42:10.332
This one's going to a mortuary in L.A.

01:42:12.001 --> 01:42:14.503
I'm gonna check this one.

01:42:37.693 --> 01:42:40.153
That's that bullshit
that I be talking about.

01:42:40.363 --> 01:42:42.531
Mike, the motherfucking head fell off.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.574
Come here.

01:42:46.744 --> 01:42:49.162
I'm back in the game.

01:42:52.792 --> 01:42:54.376
Think I got something.

01:42:55.711 --> 01:42:57.045
Feels like a bag.

01:42:58.214 --> 01:42:59.714
Shit, it's his kidney.

01:43:09.267 --> 01:43:11.142
I smell dead people.

01:43:11.727 --> 01:43:14.312
Drugs and money. We got him, baby.

01:43:24.574 --> 01:43:25.907
This dude is loaded.

01:43:26.492 --> 01:43:30.495
Bet he thinks he's a damn genius,
transporting them in dead bodies.

01:43:31.497 --> 01:43:32.956
Let's get this body.

01:43:35.084 --> 01:43:36.710
Mike, you got company, man.

01:43:36.919 --> 01:43:39.921
Somebody's coming. Hide!
Give me the X. Give me the X.

01:43:42.508 --> 01:43:44.134
You gotta stall them.
You gotta stall them.

01:43:50.099 --> 01:43:51.766
Hide! Hide! Hide!

01:43:52.143 --> 01:43:53.184
Shit!

01:43:53.436 --> 01:43:55.687
Punk kids do this? Go check it out.

01:43:55.897 --> 01:43:56.938
Hide!

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:04.863
Marcus! Why would you?
That's just not smart, man.

01:44:09.118 --> 01:44:11.286
You tell Theresa, I'll kill you.

01:44:17.126 --> 01:44:18.668
Bimbo's next.

01:44:19.128 --> 01:44:22.213
Oh, God. Not that. Not the bimbo.

01:44:23.633 --> 01:44:25.634
Let's hurry this shit up.

01:44:35.478 --> 01:44:37.145
Shit.

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:39.439
We got a big problem.
We got a big problem.

01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:41.775
Drive that ambulance
into the building right now.

01:44:41.984 --> 01:44:45.320
- Crash it into the building!
- No. Not me, baby.

01:44:45.529 --> 01:44:47.530
I got too many crashes on my file.
You do it.

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:50.951
No. You're kidding. I got red-flagged
last month for the thing.

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:54.579
You know how much the city paid.
I can't have another ding on my file.

01:44:56.207 --> 01:44:59.125
Mike, my man, we wanna help
you out here, you know...

01:44:59.335 --> 01:45:02.629
but we got a couple of administration
problems over here, you know?

01:45:02.838 --> 01:45:05.382
So how about we give sirens
and some flashing lights?

01:45:05.591 --> 01:45:06.841
Make a racket. How's that?

01:45:07.843 --> 01:45:09.469
Negative! Negative!

01:45:09.679 --> 01:45:11.846
Crash that ambulance
into the building right now!

01:45:12.181 --> 01:45:14.641
We wanna help the team out
and everything, but...

01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:16.643
But I'm not getting suspended for this.

01:45:16.852 --> 01:45:20.981
Okay, I plan on whupping y'all
asses the second I get out of here.

01:45:21.190 --> 01:45:23.566
- Crash into the building right now!
- Screw it.

01:45:23.776 --> 01:45:25.360
Just the price of cop business.

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:27.529
Now, get her on the table.

01:45:38.207 --> 01:45:39.666
Oh, my God.

01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:45.422
Jeez! What the hell! I'm so I'm so

01:45:45.715 --> 01:45:46.798
That's tragic, man.

01:45:47.091 --> 01:45:48.800
Go, go, go. Back door's clear. Go! Go!

01:45:49.301 --> 01:45:50.844
Get up, Marcus!

01:45:51.262 --> 01:45:53.638
The gas got stuck. I didn't mean to.

01:46:00.396 --> 01:46:01.980
Oh, man.

01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:06.151
Supple leather, you know.

01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:09.821
You ever rub your leather?

01:46:10.072 --> 01:46:13.241
You know, like, just rub it.
See how good it feels.

01:46:16.746 --> 01:46:19.122
What does love mean to you, Mike?

01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:22.250
Don't worry about me and my love.

01:46:23.294 --> 01:46:25.837
Look, I got plenty of love in my life.

01:46:27.006 --> 01:46:28.840
Like a woman's butt.

01:46:29.133 --> 01:46:31.843
- Don't do that.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mike.

01:46:32.094 --> 01:46:34.054
Let's just concentrate
and get this warrant.

01:46:34.346 --> 01:46:35.805
I need to express right now.

01:46:36.098 --> 01:46:40.018
I want you to know, if this is
our last job, I really appreciate you.

01:46:40.269 --> 01:46:41.352
Okay?

01:46:41.604 --> 01:46:42.687
No, this is not gay shit.

01:46:42.938 --> 01:46:45.482
This is man shit. You know what I mean?

01:46:45.775 --> 01:46:47.901
And you a beautiful man. You know?

01:46:48.194 --> 01:46:50.445
And when you let the beautiful side

01:46:51.947 --> 01:46:53.740
- What?
- Look at your pupils.

01:46:54.033 --> 01:46:56.034
How am I look at my pupil? What, I'm

01:46:56.786 --> 01:46:59.704
Yo, what are you taking?
Did you take some of that X?

01:47:00.289 --> 01:47:03.333
- Hey, look, give me a hug.
- Hey, get off. Listen, listen. Listen!

01:47:03.626 --> 01:47:07.337
We need this warrant. Do not
fuck this up. Pull yourself together.

01:47:13.677 --> 01:47:15.220
Evening, captain.

01:47:15.471 --> 01:47:17.055
Hello...

01:47:17.306 --> 01:47:18.723
"captain."

01:47:18.974 --> 01:47:21.893
So how do you two plan to fuck up
my evening tonight?

01:47:22.144 --> 01:47:25.396
Well, captain, believe me,
we would not be here...

01:47:25.689 --> 01:47:28.733
if it weren't seriously,
utterly important.

01:47:29.527 --> 01:47:30.735
Get in here.

01:47:31.987 --> 01:47:33.488
Get off me!

01:47:42.665 --> 01:47:46.251
Cap, this is beautiful.

01:47:46.502 --> 01:47:48.711
Have such a warm feel, you know.

01:47:49.004 --> 01:47:52.048
Sort of like a "ving shwa."
What's it, Mike?

01:47:52.341 --> 01:47:56.094
- It was a V, like a "von schwo."
- Why don't you have a seat?

01:47:56.387 --> 01:47:59.264
- Or "ven wangs" or
- Feng shui.

01:47:59.515 --> 01:48:00.932
"Von sway."

01:48:01.517 --> 01:48:03.768
You have a "von sway" home.

01:48:04.061 --> 01:48:05.311
Make yourself at home.

01:48:05.604 --> 01:48:08.481
All right, captain, I know you said
that Johnny Tapia was hands

01:48:08.774 --> 01:48:11.401
- Oh, no! No!
- Look, captain, we got him. It's a wrap.

01:48:11.694 --> 01:48:14.988
Look, we messed up today,
but we got him. Please just look.

01:48:15.281 --> 01:48:18.283
- How do I move it?
- Here, you flip through the pictures.

01:48:19.368 --> 01:48:21.452
You can flip
You can flip through picture

01:48:22.079 --> 01:48:23.288
This is horrible.

01:48:28.711 --> 01:48:31.337
- Take the picture.
- You can look really close.

01:48:31.589 --> 01:48:34.048
Listen, we got everything
that we need to take this dude.

01:48:34.884 --> 01:48:36.301
Oh, God.

01:48:36.927 --> 01:48:38.845
They're taking the organs out.

01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:42.473
Right there you can You can
Yeah. If you look there...

01:48:42.892 --> 01:48:44.392
Oh, gosh.

01:48:48.063 --> 01:48:50.440
This is good. That's horrible.

01:48:52.401 --> 01:48:53.818
Look at this.

01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:57.488
Everybody just needs to relax.

01:48:59.158 --> 01:49:02.660
What are you doing? Marcus,
it's 2 a.m. Get your hands off me.

01:49:04.079 --> 01:49:07.874
Remember we said we
were gonna call Vargas and Reyes?

01:49:08.167 --> 01:49:10.501
- No, I don't
- Call Vargas!

01:49:11.045 --> 01:49:13.338
Tell him the thing we said to tell him.

01:49:14.006 --> 01:49:16.716
- What thing?
- Tell him we said About yesterday.

01:49:17.509 --> 01:49:19.010
And tell him about the thing.

01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:21.930
So, captain, listen,
we've also got videotape.

01:49:22.181 --> 01:49:24.724
Yesterday, we fucked up bad.
But we got him now.

01:49:25.517 --> 01:49:26.684
Oh, shit.

01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:28.770
- What?
- No, a lot of times with these

01:49:29.063 --> 01:49:30.104
Oh, shit!

01:49:30.522 --> 01:49:32.440
- What? Did I erase it?
- No. We got video.

01:49:32.650 --> 01:49:35.360
- We got fucking...
- Oh. Let me see.

01:49:36.946 --> 01:49:37.987
Oh, shit.

01:49:38.447 --> 01:49:40.740
He's shipping the drugs around
the country in bodies.

01:49:40.991 --> 01:49:42.951
We found coffins of cash,
tagged for Cuba.

01:49:43.202 --> 01:49:45.912
And you think Tapia's about
to move out with all this money?

01:49:46.455 --> 01:49:49.082
I love it when you call me Bunny Nose.

01:49:49.333 --> 01:49:50.750
Shit!

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:52.335
Yeah, I do, girl.

01:49:52.544 --> 01:49:54.712
You should see this sexy shit I got on.

01:49:54.964 --> 01:49:56.714
Who the hell are you talking to?

01:49:56.966 --> 01:49:59.759
I talked to Vargas and...

01:50:00.552 --> 01:50:04.931
Ru Reyes. They said that
they down for whatever.

01:50:05.182 --> 01:50:07.767
This is a nice fish, you know.

01:50:07.977 --> 01:50:11.396
Big fucking eyes,
but a nice fucking fish.

01:50:11.981 --> 01:50:13.773
We need this warrant, captain.

01:50:14.066 --> 01:50:15.775
Let's take this scumbag down.

01:50:21.991 --> 01:50:23.741
What the fuck is going on?

01:50:24.868 --> 01:50:28.997
- He ingested X.
- You okay, pal? Take it easy.

01:50:30.165 --> 01:50:31.499
Okay, thank you.

01:50:31.709 --> 01:50:33.876
Poison lady says we gotta keep him cool.

01:50:34.128 --> 01:50:36.879
Otherwise, he's burning up,
he can get brain damage.

01:50:37.131 --> 01:50:38.840
Nobody will even notice that.

01:50:43.762 --> 01:50:45.305
Mike, I got an erection.

01:50:48.058 --> 01:50:49.684
- Take me home.
- Hey.

01:50:50.269 --> 01:50:53.730
Call the wife, tell her I'm on the way.

01:51:03.782 --> 01:51:05.825
Hope you guys hear me.

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:11.289
- We got her. Loud and clear.
- She's in.

01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:12.999
Showtime.

01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:15.293
Palm Mortuary, Alpha team.

01:51:15.544 --> 01:51:18.796
Tapia's mansion, Delta.
Dixie Boy boat dock, Bravo.

01:51:19.048 --> 01:51:21.883
Coast Guard gunships,
anything that hits the water.

01:51:22.092 --> 01:51:23.885
We hit all three places simultaneously.

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:28.973
Tac up at 08:45.
We go hot at 09:00 sharp.

01:51:29.183 --> 01:51:30.224
Bring the noise.

01:51:37.983 --> 01:51:41.235
You're such a beautiful girl.

01:51:41.487 --> 01:51:43.071
Thank you.

01:51:43.655 --> 01:51:45.656
- Johnny.
- Yeah?

01:51:45.949 --> 01:51:47.909
- Is she a Negro?
- Please, Mama!

01:51:48.118 --> 01:51:49.494
Shut up! Get out of here!

01:51:50.788 --> 01:51:52.497
You make your bed, you sleep in it!

01:52:00.756 --> 01:52:02.423
Make way!

01:52:03.801 --> 01:52:06.677
- Get down!
- Don't fucking move!

01:52:07.638 --> 01:52:10.681
You take risks. I like that.

01:52:11.225 --> 01:52:12.433
Or...

01:52:15.145 --> 01:52:18.564
maybe I'm the one
taking a risk on you, huh?

01:52:19.316 --> 01:52:20.525
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:52:23.237 --> 01:52:26.072
Excuse me, boss. We need to talk now.

01:52:26.782 --> 01:52:28.282
Something's going on outside.

01:52:29.743 --> 01:52:31.744
- Cops.
- What the fuck do you mean, cops?

01:52:34.164 --> 01:52:35.623
Goddamn it.

01:52:37.251 --> 01:52:39.669
DEA. You don't plan on entering, do you?

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:44.048
- We have a warrant to get in there.
- A UC's inside. She's gotta leave first.

01:52:44.299 --> 01:52:45.383
You got two minutes.

01:52:45.634 --> 01:52:47.552
- Call her on her cell.
- Yes, sir.

01:52:48.846 --> 01:52:50.638
Cut the power to the house.

01:52:52.349 --> 01:52:54.308
- You got her? Well, let's go.
- No, sir.

01:52:58.814 --> 01:53:00.231
We got a bogey.

01:53:03.986 --> 01:53:08.823
God. This is for you, Josef,
and me and Mother Russia.

01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:14.162
They're not gangbanger homeys.
They're cops.

01:53:14.413 --> 01:53:15.580
Cops?

01:53:16.123 --> 01:53:20.418
They weren't trying to hit the load.
I think they were looking after her.

01:53:27.885 --> 01:53:29.093
Now, you tell me...

01:53:29.344 --> 01:53:31.929
- where is the wire?
- They made her.

01:53:32.806 --> 01:53:35.099
We gotta get her out. Go! Come on!

01:53:35.684 --> 01:53:39.479
Hey, Tapia, you fucking mother.

01:53:45.319 --> 01:53:47.945
The Russian Grim Reaper is here.

01:53:49.156 --> 01:53:50.823
Everything's in here.

01:53:51.575 --> 01:53:54.368
- Oh, shit.
- Goddamn.

01:53:54.578 --> 01:53:57.413
Eyeball, has anything left this
mortuary in the past two hours?

01:53:57.664 --> 01:54:01.209
A four-hearse funeral just left.
We trailed them to Miami Harbour.

01:54:01.752 --> 01:54:04.962
Miami Air, Tapia's running his
money to Cuba. Get us a chopper!

01:54:11.929 --> 01:54:14.388
Hey, Tapia!

01:54:15.766 --> 01:54:17.892
You scared of me, you little scumbag?

01:54:18.101 --> 01:54:20.561
- We got some heat.
- Pull the car back.

01:54:20.854 --> 01:54:23.856
I'll fucking kill you!
Who the hell are you?

01:54:24.107 --> 01:54:25.983
- Drop the weapon!
- Drop the weapon now!

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.903
- I'm with you guys!
- Put it down, now!

01:54:29.112 --> 01:54:30.780
- I'm over here!
- Shut up!

01:54:31.031 --> 01:54:33.699
- Drop the weapon!
- I'll kill that son of a bitch!

01:54:44.294 --> 01:54:47.171
This is Alpha. Heads up to the
Coast Guard Sharks and Bravo Team.

01:54:47.422 --> 01:54:49.549
Close the harbour.
Freeze any moving speedboat.

01:54:49.758 --> 01:54:50.758
This is Bravo.

01:54:50.968 --> 01:54:53.844
We got a go-fast slinging a high rate
of speed down Miami harbour.

01:54:54.096 --> 01:54:55.721
Stop that boat.

01:55:10.904 --> 01:55:12.446
This guy's moving us.

01:55:15.576 --> 01:55:17.535
Think we're going for the bridge.

01:55:47.441 --> 01:55:49.150
Coast Guard, we're going in.

01:55:50.861 --> 01:55:52.653
Miami Police. Shut it down.

01:55:52.946 --> 01:55:55.239
This is the police. Shut it down.

01:56:01.121 --> 01:56:03.331
- Watch out, he got a weapon.
- Bail out!

01:56:07.878 --> 01:56:09.754
Coast Guard, take him down. Burn him.

01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:23.184
Vessel is dead in the water.
Vessel is dead in the water.

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:28.689
This is what we do.

01:56:32.402 --> 01:56:34.862
Oh, man, it's full up. It's full up.

01:56:35.155 --> 01:56:36.781
It's a righteous bust.

01:56:46.708 --> 01:56:48.376
How the hell they slip away?

01:56:49.503 --> 01:56:51.545
Give me the watch commander on the horn.

01:56:51.755 --> 01:56:54.298
Do you know her brother
on Miami P.D.? Find him.

01:56:55.175 --> 01:56:59.387
Do you know anyone
who might want to save your life?

01:57:04.351 --> 01:57:06.644
- Hello?
- Marcus, they!

01:57:06.895 --> 01:57:10.439
You have $100 million of mine...

01:57:10.691 --> 01:57:13.067
and I want it back in 48 hours.

01:57:25.038 --> 01:57:27.039
Shit just got real.

01:57:37.801 --> 01:57:39.677
Jack Snell, DEA.

01:57:39.970 --> 01:57:41.512
Agent Eames, FBI...

01:57:41.972 --> 01:57:43.848
who has just informed me...

01:57:44.307 --> 01:57:48.602
that satellite pinpointed Tapia's jet
in Cuban airspace 20 minutes ago.

01:57:48.812 --> 01:57:50.438
Cuba?

01:57:50.647 --> 01:57:53.858
United States does not negotiate
with hostage-takers.

01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:56.068
Especially Cuban hostage-takers.

01:57:56.319 --> 01:57:58.738
It's a delicate situation.

01:57:59.406 --> 01:58:02.825
This is not just a situation.
This is my sister.

01:58:03.076 --> 01:58:05.911
Off the record,
all State Department agencies...

01:58:06.163 --> 01:58:09.081
are using their back-channel
contacts for a diplomatic solution.

01:58:09.332 --> 01:58:12.418
You know, by the time
y'all finish being diplomatic...

01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:16.130
my sister could be in a fucking box.
This is bullshit.

01:58:38.445 --> 01:58:40.821
He ain't getting away from us that easy.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.166
We ride together...

01:58:53.877 --> 01:58:55.503
we die together.

01:58:57.547 --> 01:58:59.340
Bad boys for life.

01:59:06.348 --> 01:59:08.516
We just gotta do it ourselves, man.

01:59:36.253 --> 01:59:37.545
I don't know you.

01:59:37.754 --> 01:59:40.631
You look like you're about to do
something stupid. I'm in.

01:59:41.424 --> 01:59:44.009
Dodd tell you how
crazy us ex-Delta guys are?

01:59:45.345 --> 01:59:47.096
My brother, Tito, lives in Cuba.

01:59:47.347 --> 01:59:50.391
He's a little crazy, but he's hooked up
with the underground.

01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:53.227
Weapons, men, a safe house.
Whatever we need.

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:55.688
You can forget about passports
and all that stuff.

01:59:55.897 --> 01:59:58.816
Because if the Cubans catch us,
we're all dead.

01:59:59.192 --> 02:00:02.862
My brother Tito's in Alpha 66,
the Anti-Castro Underground.

02:00:03.113 --> 02:00:04.738
What does that have to do with Tapia?

02:00:05.448 --> 02:00:08.659
Everything. Tapia's the biggest
supplier of drug cash to Castro.

02:00:08.910 --> 02:00:10.744
So Alpha 66 will be all over him.

02:00:11.037 --> 02:00:15.124
Brother, that is perfect. He says he
can get men on the tunnel right away.

02:00:15.375 --> 02:00:16.542
Let me holler at him.

02:00:17.377 --> 02:00:20.504
Tito, we need layout, security,
the whole deal.

02:00:20.755 --> 02:00:24.675
We got info that Tapia's got a casket
coming in tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.

02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:27.845
Yeah, that might be our way in. Yeah.

02:00:28.597 --> 02:00:32.433
Brought you a little care package
from my friends over at the CIA.

02:00:32.726 --> 02:00:35.769
They want to help. And don't ask me.

02:00:36.897 --> 02:00:38.063
They're spies.

02:00:38.398 --> 02:00:42.902
Former Delta Intel and Demo.
Requesting permission to tag along.

02:00:59.669 --> 02:01:02.630
Ronnie, I hear there's a boat
on fire off the coast of Cuba.

02:01:03.173 --> 02:01:05.633
Shouldn't we break
international waters to help them?

02:01:05.926 --> 02:01:06.967
That's my dog.

02:01:11.932 --> 02:01:13.641
Point of no return.

02:01:14.184 --> 02:01:16.560
I wanna thank y'all
from the bottom of my heart.

02:01:18.021 --> 02:01:22.274
- Mike, look, I just
- Tell me when we get back.

02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:25.819
The target's in sight. I see the boat.

02:01:26.112 --> 02:01:28.822
Roger. Target 12 o'clock, 300 yards.

02:01:31.409 --> 02:01:33.827
Roper in the door. Stand by.

02:01:37.582 --> 02:01:39.416
Go! Go! Go!

02:01:50.845 --> 02:01:53.639
- Tito?
- Welcome to Cuba.

02:02:11.324 --> 02:02:16.078
Damn. What's up with the safe house
across the street from Tapia's crib?

02:02:16.287 --> 02:02:18.038
This is the last place
anyone would look.

02:02:18.331 --> 02:02:22.167
We've been watching the place.
Guards play soccer each day at 3:30.

02:02:23.086 --> 02:02:27.131
The bad news, everyone knows he
uses the army like his bodyguards.

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:31.385
- This is Tapia's compound.
- CIA hooked us up, huh?

02:02:31.678 --> 02:02:35.055
Yeah. This LIDAR laser technology
even shows his escape tunnel.

02:02:35.265 --> 02:02:37.808
The alarm security is wired to the army.

02:02:38.059 --> 02:02:41.645
We're screwed if we don't blow up this
security room before we make a move.

02:02:41.896 --> 02:02:43.564
The tunnel we're digging branches off.

02:02:43.857 --> 02:02:47.651
One under his back yard
and the other into his escape tunnel.

02:02:48.611 --> 02:02:50.154
We gotta hurry up.

02:02:51.614 --> 02:02:54.992
See? I told you my brother was a maniac.

02:02:56.703 --> 02:02:59.079
- How we looking?
- Let me check it out.

02:03:18.391 --> 02:03:20.476
Papi, you look like Jesus.

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:23.479
Why they call this The Last Supper?

02:03:23.730 --> 02:03:27.775
It was the last time they were all
together before Jesus was crucified.

02:03:28.651 --> 02:03:30.402
Crucified?

02:03:31.654 --> 02:03:33.906
Hold your ears. Hey, you.

02:03:34.491 --> 02:03:38.535
Listen to me. This is fucking
depressing! You understand?

02:03:38.787 --> 02:03:40.871
I mean, who had this fucking idea?

02:03:41.915 --> 02:03:45.876
I just want little angels
looking down on me.

02:03:46.878 --> 02:03:49.963
Okay, here's the ocean,
300 yards from Tapia's house.

02:03:50.256 --> 02:03:53.801
We're here. Safe house.
First tunnel comes through to here.

02:03:54.052 --> 02:03:56.470
First team takes out
the security station.

02:03:56.763 --> 02:03:59.640
Second tunnel comes through
into the centre of the house.

02:04:00.016 --> 02:04:03.310
Tito, your contacts inside
said Syd's in the last bedroom...

02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:04.812
on the second floor, right?

02:04:05.063 --> 02:04:07.648
Lupe's one of us.
If she says your sister's there...

02:04:07.857 --> 02:04:08.857
she is there.

02:04:09.067 --> 02:04:12.694
Three o'clock sharp, the bag of cats
and iguanas go over the fence.

02:04:12.946 --> 02:04:16.198
Hopefully, the motion detectors will go
so crazy, security will shut them off.

02:04:16.533 --> 02:04:19.159
My guys will watch the outside
for any military.

02:04:19.369 --> 02:04:21.328
If they come, that's bad.

02:04:30.713 --> 02:04:32.339
Let's make this count, guys.

02:04:56.281 --> 02:04:57.906
We're in.

02:05:17.177 --> 02:05:20.053
Goddamn it, it's the fifth time today.

02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:25.100
Carlos, turn off the motion sensors
till we get it fixed.

02:05:25.435 --> 02:05:27.561
- Look what I found. Can I keep them?
- No.

02:05:27.937 --> 02:05:29.229
All right, guys...

02:05:29.439 --> 02:05:32.566
- sensors are down. Time to move.
- We are 100 percent go.

02:05:33.818 --> 02:05:35.402
Let's go.

02:05:51.377 --> 02:05:54.922
Left. Left. Yeah. There we go.
This is not as easy as it looks.

02:06:14.025 --> 02:06:16.276
Okay, we're at the T. Split right.

02:06:19.197 --> 02:06:20.614
Good luck, guys.

02:06:24.661 --> 02:06:26.787
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

02:06:29.457 --> 02:06:32.918
Find the soccer game.
Sniff it out, baby. Sniff it out.

02:06:38.967 --> 02:06:40.759
To the left. To the left. Oh, shit.

02:06:47.225 --> 02:06:49.268
Oh, you did not see me.

02:06:53.731 --> 02:06:57.150
- Ready to bust into the escape tunnel.
- There we go. Soccer.

02:07:09.664 --> 02:07:10.789
Sorry.

02:07:18.298 --> 02:07:19.923
Go, go, go!

02:07:36.065 --> 02:07:37.566
Go!

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:40.861
Get me the American bitch.

02:07:41.112 --> 02:07:43.405
Call General Santos.
Tell him I need him now!

02:07:44.282 --> 02:07:46.908
Sorry, darling. Take her outside
to safety. Come on.

02:08:05.887 --> 02:08:07.804
- Carlos, this is not good!
- I know!

02:08:08.222 --> 02:08:10.599
- Where is General Santos?
- He's coming, boss!

02:08:17.565 --> 02:08:20.692
You fucking maricons!
I'm gonna blow your head off!

02:08:21.152 --> 02:08:22.527
Fuck!

02:08:22.904 --> 02:08:26.823
What's happened to this gun?
My son will slice you into chorizo.

02:08:27.367 --> 02:08:29.159
- Mama, I'm very sorry.
- You little puta!

02:08:39.003 --> 02:08:41.296
- Vargas, you in?
- We got Mama and the girl.

02:08:41.547 --> 02:08:43.632
We're entering the house. Go!

02:08:58.314 --> 02:08:59.606
Move! Move! Move!

02:09:12.662 --> 02:09:15.789
Everything's clear outside.
You got 30 seconds max. Haul ass.

02:09:20.545 --> 02:09:23.964
You got two rovers on the balcony.
I can't get a shot off.

02:09:26.509 --> 02:09:28.552
See the rover? I missed him!

02:09:34.934 --> 02:09:36.309
Get down! Get down now!

02:09:36.519 --> 02:09:37.644
- Get down!
- Down!

02:09:40.356 --> 02:09:42.315
Move! Move! Move!

02:09:42.733 --> 02:09:44.317
- Marcus!
- Come on!

02:09:44.527 --> 02:09:46.278
Move! We got the package.

02:09:46.529 --> 02:09:48.989
Move now. It's turning
into a real bad day.

02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.492
- Vargas, we're coming back. Cover us!
- We got you covered, baby.

02:10:06.382 --> 02:10:08.175
Somebody talk to me. What's going on?

02:10:08.426 --> 02:10:09.759
The military is everywhere.

02:10:17.059 --> 02:10:20.145
- This is bad, I have to go.
- Listen, you have a lot of company.

02:10:20.396 --> 02:10:22.689
Get out of there now!

02:10:30.072 --> 02:10:31.573
I'm hit! I'm hit!

02:10:32.992 --> 02:10:35.410
Head for the tunnel. I'll blow this.

02:10:38.748 --> 02:10:40.540
Go, go! Get out!

02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:55.847
Mike, you gotta get out.

02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:59.601
Vargas! Get out! Abort!

02:10:59.852 --> 02:11:01.853
We won't reach the tunnel! Go to plan B.

02:11:02.104 --> 02:11:03.939
- We're going to plan B!
- What plan B?

02:11:04.190 --> 02:11:05.565
You don't pay attention to shit!

02:11:05.816 --> 02:11:07.567
- What's the plan B?
- That's your problem!

02:11:07.777 --> 02:11:09.694
Are you fucking shitting me? Let's go!

02:11:09.946 --> 02:11:11.446
- Follow me! Follow me!
- I will

02:11:11.697 --> 02:11:14.407
Plan B? What the hell is plan B?

02:11:15.618 --> 02:11:18.870
- Tito, what you doing here?
- You need a Cuban guide, fool.

02:11:19.121 --> 02:11:20.497
This way!

02:11:22.124 --> 02:11:24.793
- They won't make it to the tunnel.
- Let's blow out of here!

02:11:27.838 --> 02:11:29.506
Keys, keys, keys!

02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:47.774
Oh, my God! No! God! Oh, my God!

02:11:51.988 --> 02:11:53.863
Plan B did not have
that big-ass gun in it!

02:11:54.323 --> 02:11:57.826
You call this plan B?
What the plan B stand for? Bullshit!

02:11:58.035 --> 02:11:59.077
Do you wanna drive?

02:11:59.328 --> 02:12:01.746
Yeah, pull over by the fuckers
with the machine guns!

02:12:01.998 --> 02:12:03.290
Shit!

02:12:10.047 --> 02:12:11.715
Yeah.

02:12:12.091 --> 02:12:13.800
I am not to be fucked with!

02:12:16.012 --> 02:12:19.639
I missed the part of the meeting when
you drive through the dining room.

02:12:19.890 --> 02:12:21.683
And right out the front door.

02:12:38.951 --> 02:12:40.410
Get in the truck!

02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:46.041
Cuban army was everywhere.

02:13:02.475 --> 02:13:05.018
- Gotta get us to Guantanamo Bay!
- No.

02:13:05.269 --> 02:13:07.145
You can't drive onto a U.S. Naval base.

02:13:07.396 --> 02:13:08.688
Hey, we're Americans, okay?

02:13:12.401 --> 02:13:15.362
Marcus, you know how when
we usually get in these situations...

02:13:15.571 --> 02:13:19.074
I'm always trying to make you
feel better, like, "We'll be all right."

02:13:19.325 --> 02:13:21.159
- Yeah, yeah.
- I could say it...

02:13:21.369 --> 02:13:23.745
but that'd be a bunch of bullshit today.

02:13:34.090 --> 02:13:35.382
Military, military.

02:13:35.591 --> 02:13:37.717
- Which way?
- No, right! Right! Go right!

02:13:43.265 --> 02:13:45.892
These are drug-dealer shacks.
They make cocaine here.

02:13:46.102 --> 02:13:48.228
Hope there's shit in there
that likes to blow.

02:13:57.321 --> 02:13:59.572
Faster! I'll kill you, motherfucker!

02:13:59.782 --> 02:14:00.907
I'm gonna go for it.

02:14:01.117 --> 02:14:03.118
- This is a big-ass hill.
- Shit.

02:14:11.210 --> 02:14:15.130
- Oh, shit! Is this still called plan B?
- No, this is definitely plan C.

02:14:50.124 --> 02:14:51.166
Oh, Jesus!

02:15:10.686 --> 02:15:12.312
God! God!

02:15:12.521 --> 02:15:14.981
Everybody, start shooting at somebody!

02:15:17.943 --> 02:15:19.444
Shoot! Shoot!

02:15:24.116 --> 02:15:27.035
- Shit! I'm out!
- I got two rounds left.

02:15:27.286 --> 02:15:28.828
- One in the chamber.
- I'm out.

02:15:29.038 --> 02:15:31.331
All these guns,
and none of you got no bullets?

02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:34.709
- I got one in my hip!
- Oh, God, he's hit!

02:15:37.254 --> 02:15:38.546
There! Gitmo!

02:15:40.424 --> 02:15:42.467
U.S. soil, baby. U.S. soil.

02:15:42.676 --> 02:15:43.718
Come on! Go!

02:15:45.304 --> 02:15:48.223
- Americans on the way!
- Whoa, watch

02:15:54.313 --> 02:15:55.688
Run it! Run it!

02:16:11.455 --> 02:16:12.872
Go.

02:16:25.344 --> 02:16:26.886
Go! Go! Go!

02:16:34.978 --> 02:16:36.228
Fuck.

02:16:39.191 --> 02:16:40.275
Mike!

02:16:59.503 --> 02:17:01.296
We're Americans!

02:17:01.547 --> 02:17:04.632
I pay my motherfucking taxes!
Shoot them!

02:17:04.884 --> 02:17:07.260
Hey, fucking gringo. Drop the gun!

02:17:07.468 --> 02:17:10.513
Put it down! Put it down!

02:17:14.643 --> 02:17:18.938
They can't help you.
You're staying in Cuba.

02:17:23.527 --> 02:17:25.945
You are standing on a live minefield!

02:17:26.322 --> 02:17:27.780
Do not move!

02:17:29.532 --> 02:17:32.619
Look, why don't we all go home

02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:35.288
Well, we'll go home, you go to a hotel.

02:17:35.539 --> 02:17:39.459
Work this shit out another day. None of
us is having a good day right now.

02:17:39.709 --> 02:17:40.959
- Give me the gun!
- Okay.

02:17:41.253 --> 02:17:42.962
I'll toss it right at your feet...

02:17:43.172 --> 02:17:45.548
right next to the mine.

02:18:41.397 --> 02:18:43.647
Now, that's how you supposed to shoot!

02:18:43.898 --> 02:18:46.776
From now on, that's how you shoot!

02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:50.862
Oh, I want my next partner
to shoot just like that.

02:18:51.073 --> 02:18:54.534
It take a dysfunctional motherfucker
to bust somebody in the head like that.

02:18:54.743 --> 02:18:56.576
That's some dysfunctional shit.

02:18:56.829 --> 02:18:59.496
My next partner willll invite me
to his barbecues, though.

02:18:59.748 --> 02:19:01.749
Come here, girl. Come here.

02:19:04.085 --> 02:19:06.337
I came all the way to Cuba for this.

02:19:08.841 --> 02:19:10.924
Come on.

02:19:11.175 --> 02:19:14.094
Y'all gotta do that
around the land mines?

02:19:16.974 --> 02:19:20.768
Would you tell them that that shit is
dangerous around these land mines?

02:19:33.490 --> 02:19:37.701
You know, Mike, this ain't easy for me,
but I was wrong.

02:19:37.952 --> 02:19:41.748
I'll be very proud for you
to date my sister.

02:19:41.999 --> 02:19:43.540
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

02:19:44.084 --> 02:19:46.084
You know, me and Syd thought about it...

02:19:46.295 --> 02:19:48.296
and your behaviour was so crazy that...

02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:53.134
any magic we could've captured,
probably best if we didn't... You know.

02:19:53.385 --> 02:19:56.012
You're just gonna take advantage
of my little sister?

02:19:56.263 --> 02:19:57.722
Already, you breaking her heart?

02:19:57.973 --> 02:20:00.349
- What you talking about?
- She not good enough for you?

02:20:00.893 --> 02:20:03.227
Syd, Mike says you ain't shit!

02:20:03.479 --> 02:20:06.355
Now, why would you scream out
some crazy nonsense like that?

02:20:06.607 --> 02:20:11.194
I don't appreciate you coming here,
disrespecting me in my new pool.

02:20:11.445 --> 02:20:12.612
I bought your new pool.

02:20:12.905 --> 02:20:17.617
Why don't you hook this pool up
to your Ferrari and drag it out of here?

02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:19.368
First of all, I was joking.

02:20:19.578 --> 02:20:22.622
And second of all, all this right here,
smell yourself right now.

02:20:22.831 --> 02:20:24.999
Because this moment is
what's wrong with you.

02:20:25.209 --> 02:20:27.376
I got the transfer papers
in the trash can.

02:20:27.753 --> 02:20:29.921
I'll get them and glue them the fuck up.

02:20:30.255 --> 02:20:31.422
- Glue them up.
- What?

02:20:31.673 --> 02:20:33.424
- Want some glue?
- We won't be partners no more.

02:20:33.634 --> 02:20:34.675
I got glue in the car.

02:20:34.927 --> 02:20:38.638
I'm trying to talk to you. It's hot,
I feel like I'm cooking in this fucker...

02:20:38.847 --> 02:20:41.849
and I gotta hear shit out of you?
Then on top of that shit...

02:20:42.059 --> 02:20:43.935
you gonna dog my baby sister?

02:20:48.524 --> 02:20:50.399
Oh, this that bullshit!

02:20:56.031 --> 02:20:57.240
Dad!

02:20:57.449 --> 02:20:58.491
Dad!

02:20:58.742 --> 02:21:02.286
I kept the warranty.
I kept the warranty!

02:21:03.372 --> 02:21:05.248
Bad boys, bad boys

02:21:05.499 --> 02:21:07.083
What you gonna do?

02:21:07.334 --> 02:21:10.294
What you gonna do When we come for you?

02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:16.843
Bad boys, bad

02:21:19.888 --> 02:21:22.181
Come on, you gotta learn the words.

02:21:22.391 --> 02:21:25.351
Mike, you don't know
the damn words either.

02:21:25.561 --> 02:21:28.688
Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do?

02:21:29.022 --> 02:21:31.858
What you gonna do
When they come for you?

02:21:32.305 --> 02:21:38.167
