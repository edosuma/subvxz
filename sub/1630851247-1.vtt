something.

reasons.

reasons weren't so innocent.

Yeah, you can go, I'll
come find you later.

40:20.087 --> 40:22.957
We're looking for Belinda
Jones.

40:22.990 --> 40:24.691
What for?

40:24.725 --> 40:26.827
We have some questions
about Trip Carmichael.

40:27.962 --> 40:30.397
The police were already here,
told 'em everything I know,

40:30.431 --> 40:32.032
which ain't much.

40:32.066 --> 40:33.834
We're not with the police.

40:37.404 --> 40:40.808
I know you, surprised
we never met in person.

40:42.009 --> 40:45.279
I reckon I know just
about everyone in Elrod.

40:45.312 --> 40:47.882
Well, the men, at least,

40:47.915 --> 40:49.950
they don't seem to mind the
commute.

40:49.984 --> 40:51.418
We're not here for that.

40:52.419 --> 40:53.320
Course you're not.

40:55.823 --> 40:56.991
Y'all get in here,

40:57.024 --> 40:58.993
no sense shoutin' it from the
rooftops.

41:04.465 --> 41:06.066
[Amy] We know you
had an affair with Trip

41:06.100 --> 41:07.301
several years ago.

41:07.334 --> 41:08.135
[Belinda scoffing]

41:08.169 --> 41:08.969
18.

41:11.005 --> 41:11.772
[Amy] What?

41:16.944 --> 41:18.946
It wasn't several years ago,

41:18.979 --> 41:20.247
it was 18 years ago.

41:21.982 --> 41:24.251
Although, I would argue,

41:24.285 --> 41:27.454
the relationship didn't exactly
start out as consensual.

41:29.924 --> 41:31.691
He had a way of getting what he
wanted,

41:32.526 --> 41:33.794
if you know what I mean.

41:35.763 --> 41:37.865
Love between a man and a
woman is war, you know,

41:39.099 --> 41:40.100
guess who won.

41:41.869 --> 41:43.270
So what happened?

41:43.304 --> 41:45.206
Trip and Mama Carmichael
did their damn best

41:45.239 --> 41:46.974
to run me outta town.

41:47.007 --> 41:49.310
So I had to take matters
into my own hands.

41:49.343 --> 41:51.345
When you get scorned by the
sinners,

41:51.378 --> 41:53.113
might as well make a dime off
'em.

41:55.082 --> 41:56.951
Some might see that as a
motive.

41:56.984 --> 41:57.751
Sure might.

41:59.086 --> 42:00.921
Too bad I was with my best
customer

42:00.955 --> 42:03.023
the night Elodie Carmichael gone
missing.

42:04.158 --> 42:06.460
He works for the Sheriff's
Department.

42:06.493 --> 42:07.761
That's convenient.

42:11.832 --> 42:13.767
A good relationship with law
enforcement

42:13.801 --> 42:16.437
can be so helpful, wouldn't you
agree?

42:16.470 --> 42:18.272
You must have quite the
technique.

42:20.007 --> 42:21.542
I'm flattered.

42:21.575 --> 42:23.911
But I gave up the dirty work
years ago.

42:23.944 --> 42:26.080
The other girls fuck, I just
collect.

42:29.550 --> 42:30.818
So why are you here then?

42:31.885 --> 42:34.455
Someone's trying to pin
Elodie's kidnapping on me.

42:36.857 --> 42:41.228
Well, you must be the most
unlikely suspect I ever saw.

42:41.262 --> 42:43.931
Walker must be shitting his
pants.

42:43.964 --> 42:45.532
He's been paid off by Mama
Carmichael

42:45.566 --> 42:47.968
just like the rest of that town.

42:48.002 --> 42:49.303
Everyone except me.

42:51.272 --> 42:53.874
That'd piss me off, I'd want
revenge.

42:58.846 --> 43:01.148
Nah, water under the bridge.

43:02.249 --> 43:07.087
I do feel bad for that child
though, Elodie is her name,

43:07.121 --> 43:10.190
she looks like a good
girl on TV, real sweet.

43:11.625 --> 43:13.093
I used to be sweet too.

43:17.598 --> 43:18.899
How 'bout you?

43:20.301 --> 43:21.168
I was never sweet.

43:21.201 --> 43:23.937
I bet 'fore a man got a hold
o' you,

43:23.971 --> 43:26.940
you was just as sweet as pie.

43:26.974 --> 43:28.542
Takes one to know one,
sweetheart.

43:29.643 --> 43:31.979
You don't know anything about
me.

43:32.012 --> 43:35.949
"But then shall I know,
as even also I am known."

43:35.983 --> 43:37.384
Corinthians 13:12.

43:37.418 --> 43:39.987
Mm, wouldn't taken
you for a believer.

43:40.020 --> 43:41.322
I'm not.

43:41.355 --> 43:43.390
But then, I haven't met many
religious whores either.

43:43.424 --> 43:45.125
Amy.

43:45.159 --> 43:46.460
I'm sorry, she didn't mean that.

43:46.493 --> 43:48.028
I absolutely fucking did.

43:49.463 --> 43:50.464
Amy.

43:50.497 --> 43:52.299
[laughing]

43:52.333 --> 43:56.403
Guess I scared her off.

44:06.480 --> 44:08.515
[Charlie] Thank you for your
time.

44:08.549 --> 44:10.150
Wish I coulda been more help
to you.

44:16.323 --> 44:20.494
Hey, let me leave you my
number,

44:20.527 --> 44:21.962
in case you think of anything.

44:25.532 --> 44:28.402
Truly am sorry about
your daughter, Charlie.

44:28.435 --> 44:29.370
I appreciate that.

44:32.239 --> 44:35.376
I'm not giving up, my Lily
deserves that.

44:35.409 --> 44:37.611
[dramatic music]

44:37.644 --> 44:38.445
I'll see ya.

44:41.648 --> 44:45.619
Mary Ann Childers, that's
who you need to go see.

44:47.421 --> 44:49.356
She's got dirt on Trip
and Mama Carmichael.

44:50.524 --> 44:51.458
Thank you for that.

44:54.528 --> 44:56.563
Better watch yourself in this
mud.

44:56.597 --> 44:59.967
It's been a stormy week, hate
to see you get stuck out here.

45:04.238 --> 45:06.440
[Amy] Don't ever speak for me
again.

45:06.473 --> 45:08.442
That woman has been through a
lot.

45:08.475 --> 45:10.577
Fuck that, she's not the
helpless victim

45:10.611 --> 45:12.980
she pretends to be, even
with all the Bible talk.

45:14.415 --> 45:16.083
You seem to know your fair
share.

45:16.116 --> 45:17.484
Not by choice,

45:17.518 --> 45:19.386
my mom went through a
creepy religious phase

45:19.420 --> 45:20.287
when she lost it.

45:22.055 --> 45:23.023
Wanna talk about it?

45:29.196 --> 45:31.565
Damn, we going the right way?

45:31.598 --> 45:32.399
Hell, if I know.

45:36.170 --> 45:37.004
Hand me that map.

45:43.177 --> 45:44.144
Wanna talk about it?

45:46.613 --> 45:47.648
Mind your business.

45:50.217 --> 45:52.986
You may not like her, but
Belinda did give us a name.

45:53.020 --> 45:54.955
Glad it was a name and not a
disease.

45:56.089 --> 45:58.992
[suspenseful music]

46:02.496 --> 46:04.398
[Mary Ann] I don't mean to be
rude, but,

46:04.431 --> 46:07.167
what magazine did y'all say you
were from?

46:07.201 --> 46:09.470
Actually, we're here to
talk about Trip Carmichael.

46:12.573 --> 46:13.640
[Charlie] She knows something.

46:15.542 --> 46:19.012
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't
help you.

46:21.415 --> 46:23.283
I think it may be time for y'all
to leave.

46:23.317 --> 46:24.117
Ma'am,

46:26.353 --> 46:29.623
listen, I'm sure you've heard
Elodie Carmichael is missing,

46:29.656 --> 46:32.493
but, so is my daughter, Lily,

46:32.526 --> 46:35.162
and I think the same person
might be responsible.

46:35.195 --> 46:38.065
And if there's any chance
Trip could be that person,

46:38.098 --> 46:40.667
I have to know, please.

46:49.076 --> 46:51.378
I will deny all of this
if you repeat it to anyone.

46:52.714 --> 46:53.547
You have my word.

47:08.763 --> 47:11.365
I was a freshman, young for my
year,

47:13.333 --> 47:14.568
he was an upperclassmen.

47:17.237 --> 47:19.774
It was very flattering
to have him ask me out.

47:19.807 --> 47:21.241
So when it happened, well,

47:24.678 --> 47:25.579
no one believed me.

47:27.681 --> 47:29.349
What did happen?

47:29.383 --> 47:31.184
We went to a formal together.

47:32.319 --> 47:35.422
I had a few sips of my drink,

47:35.455 --> 47:37.424
and then next thing I knew, Trip
was

47:42.596 --> 47:43.397
on top of me.

47:46.500 --> 47:47.534
I was pretty out of it,

47:49.169 --> 47:51.839
but I know I kept asking
him to stop, begging him to.

47:55.275 --> 47:56.677
Just seemed like the more upset
I got,

47:56.711 --> 47:57.779
the more he enjoyed it.

47:59.747 --> 48:02.149
He must have slipped
something in my drink,

48:02.182 --> 48:03.317
I realize that now.

48:04.518 --> 48:06.153
But it was different in those
days,

48:08.488 --> 48:09.523
they blamed the woman.

48:11.291 --> 48:12.760
It's not that different these
days.

48:14.394 --> 48:15.495
I suppose you're right.

48:16.798 --> 48:19.366
I told a teacher I trusted
and she encouraged me

48:19.399 --> 48:20.500
to file a report.

48:21.803 --> 48:25.472
I did, but then Mama
Carmichael called my father,

48:25.505 --> 48:27.541
and that was the end of that.

48:27.574 --> 48:29.543
She threatened your family?

48:29.576 --> 48:30.912
Worse,

48:30.945 --> 48:32.312
she gave my father a job.

48:33.781 --> 48:34.681
And daddy accepted.

48:35.783 --> 48:37.618
I can't blame him.

48:37.651 --> 48:41.421
It's lifelong security, an
incredible bargain, really.

48:42.757 --> 48:44.157
[Amy] Damn.

48:44.191 --> 48:44.826
You should know,

48:46.226 --> 48:48.462
Trip thinks he can get away with
anything.

48:48.495 --> 48:49.797
Because he's rich?

48:49.831 --> 48:51.365
That's a big part, of course.

48:54.601 --> 48:57.170
But it's really because he
knows the value of a secret.

48:58.873 --> 49:00.842
The longer you keep it,
the more it's worth.

49:02.910 --> 49:06.146
Time passes and it becomes part
of you.

49:08.482 --> 49:10.617
And you're just as guilty
because you kept quiet.

49:12.319 --> 49:13.721
Trip knows that better than
anyone.

49:14.822 --> 49:17.391
[somber music]

49:23.798 --> 49:25.298
I heard about other girls.

49:27.501 --> 49:31.338
Several, actually. One
of them was only 14.

49:32.774 --> 49:35.208
So sick of hearing the same
thing,

49:35.242 --> 49:37.277
"Disgusting man does disgusting
thing

49:37.310 --> 49:38.378
and gets away with it."

49:38.412 --> 49:39.947
[Charlie spitting]

49:39.981 --> 49:41.415
Guess that goes for women too.

49:42.649 --> 49:44.451
Not all men are like Trip.

49:44.484 --> 49:46.453
I'm not some crazy man hater.

49:46.486 --> 49:47.688
After seeing the things I've
seen,

49:47.722 --> 49:49.824
you learn not to trust anyone.

49:49.857 --> 49:50.825
So you don't trust me?

49:50.858 --> 49:53.260
Nope, and you shouldn't trust
me either.

49:53.293 --> 49:55.963
Our relationship is based
solely on our mutual goal.

49:55.997 --> 49:57.297
Catching the kidnapper.

49:57.330 --> 49:58.432
Which is looking more and more

49:58.465 --> 50:00.233
like Trip Carmichael himself.

50:01.803 --> 50:03.336
Yeah, but Trip being a
predator

50:03.370 --> 50:05.773
doesn't mean he kidnapped his
daughter.

50:05.807 --> 50:07.507
Charlie, he raped a
14-year-old girl.

50:07.541 --> 50:08.743
You really think that sick fuck

50:08.776 --> 50:10.011
doesn't have anything to do with
this?

50:10.044 --> 50:12.345
What I'm saying, is that we
need proof.

50:12.379 --> 50:13.848
So, what's your plan?

50:13.881 --> 50:15.582
Sit him down and talk to him
about all the women he raped?

50:15.615 --> 50:16.984
I don't wanna talk to the guy.

50:18.585 --> 50:19.854
I wanna see where he sleeps.

50:19.887 --> 50:22.589
[dramatic music]

50:23.758 --> 50:25.258
People say I'm crazy.

50:26.293 --> 50:29.429
Well, this might be the
craziest thing I've ever done.

50:30.865 --> 50:33.935
Everybody knows the
Carmichaels own this damn town.

50:33.968 --> 50:37.471
[dramatic music continues]

50:41.976 --> 50:43.310
Why in the hell do you have
that?

[Amy] Protection.

50:44.411 --> 50:45.612
[Charlie] From who?

50:45.645 --> 50:46.848
Guys like him.

50:50.350 --> 50:51.719
[Trip] Goddammit.

50:55.355 --> 50:56.924
Come on, let's go.

[dramatic music continues]

51:07.400 --> 51:08.635
You okay?

51:08.668 --> 51:09.704
Quit asking me that.

51:11.038 --> 51:12.405
What are those?

51:12.439 --> 51:15.076
My picks, my crazy
mom used to lock herself

51:15.109 --> 51:17.879
in her room a lot, got sick of
kicking the door down, okay?

51:18.913 --> 51:21.548
[lock clicking]

51:40.101 --> 51:42.369
You go that way, I'll go this
way.

51:42.402 --> 51:43.004
Okay.

51:51.746 --> 51:54.381
[clock chiming]

51:58.986 --> 52:01.621
You can tell a lot about people
by the way that they live.

52:02.656 --> 52:04.091
Carmichael house isn't a home.

52:05.458 --> 52:07.795
It's cold, like a museum.

52:10.497 --> 52:11.766
You have to wonder

52:11.799 --> 52:13.533
when everything looks
perfect on the outside,

52:16.436 --> 52:17.537
what's hiding underneath?

Amy.

52:26.580 --> 52:29.449
[suspenseful music]

52:40.061 --> 52:42.029
I wish I knew what I was looking
for.

52:44.464 --> 52:46.566
Sometimes it's hard to tell
what's real

52:46.600 --> 52:49.469
and what's just the pills
messing with my mind.

52:56.610 --> 52:57.945
Why are they here?

52:57.979 --> 52:59.914
[Amy] Charlie, I found
something.

53:11.524 --> 53:12.159
Check this out.

53:15.196 --> 53:16.030
Where did you find this?

53:16.063 --> 53:17.798
In the dead animal room.

53:17.832 --> 53:19.200
[Charlie] I was just in there.

53:19.233 --> 53:20.935
Not in the desk drawers,
obviously.

53:20.968 --> 53:21.769
[lock clicking]

53:21.802 --> 53:23.170
Shit, go.

53:23.204 --> 53:27.540
Next time when I ask
you, now, I only want this.

53:28.575 --> 53:30.945
Join me for just five minutes,

53:30.978 --> 53:32.445
- take a little bit
- Go, go, go, go.

53:32.479 --> 53:34.815
- of responsibility.
- I don't know how

53:34.849 --> 53:35.917
to be in two places in one
time.

53:35.950 --> 53:37.018
What, you don't think I
have enough to worry about

53:37.051 --> 53:39.619
here at the house, answering
the same damn questions,

53:39.653 --> 53:40.620
- phone's ringing constantly?
- Don't take that

- tone with me, young man.
- Hey, go over there.

53:42.023 --> 53:43.024
I don't know why we're wasting
our time.

53:43.057 --> 53:44.591
We all know

53:44.624 --> 53:45.492
- who's responsible.
- Oh, I feel so sorry for you.

53:45.525 --> 53:46.426
[Trip] So just tell Walker to
arrest

53:46.459 --> 53:47.094
- the crazy old dyke
- Come on, over here.

53:47.128 --> 53:48.129
[Trip] and call it a day.

53:48.162 --> 53:52.233
I have been leaning on
Henry as much as I can,

53:52.266 --> 53:56.070
but you can't just throw a woman
in jail,

53:56.103 --> 53:59.740
even that kinda woman.

53:59.774 --> 54:01.175
What the hell are we paying
for then?

54:01.208 --> 54:04.779
I'm working on it, they
don't have the evidence yet.

54:04.812 --> 54:07.748
Oh, evidence, my ass,
we all know her past,

54:07.782 --> 54:09.683
you think this is just some
coincidence?

54:09.717 --> 54:12.019
If we lock up the wrong
person,

54:12.053 --> 54:13.955
Elodie could be gone forever.

54:14.922 --> 54:18.826
Big picture, son, we gotta
get that baby girl back safe.

54:18.859 --> 54:22.063
This is just all a play for
money, you know that, right?

54:22.096 --> 54:24.531
Has someone tried to contact
you?

54:24.564 --> 54:25.665
No, of course not.

54:27.969 --> 54:31.806
Good, because I expect
you to keep me in the loop

54:31.839 --> 54:33.774
so I can protect you.

54:33.808 --> 54:37.912
Our family comes first,
son, never forget that.

54:37.945 --> 54:40.715
Yeah, here I thought the
company came first, boss.

54:42.717 --> 54:45.219
Son, I have spent the last 30
years

54:45.252 --> 54:48.990
cleaning up your messes
because you are my child.

54:49.023 --> 54:53.794
But I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let you destroy my legacy.

54:54.895 --> 54:56.063
Mom, okay,

54:56.097 --> 54:57.131
- mom, I'm not destroy-
- I tell you what,

54:57.164 --> 54:59.300
it's getting harder and
harder to find a reason

54:59.333 --> 55:02.569
to keep covering for your smart
ass.

55:02.602 --> 55:04.671
We will do whatever it takes

55:04.705 --> 55:07.674
to get my granddaughter home
safe.

55:09.910 --> 55:10.711
You hear me?

55:13.180 --> 55:14.115
Let's go, let's go.

55:14.148 --> 55:14.949
No, they'll see us.

55:14.982 --> 55:16.017
Sorry, mommy.

55:16.050 --> 55:16.884
[dramatic music]

55:16.917 --> 55:18.119
I need a damn drink.

55:19.320 --> 55:20.154
No, Charlie wait.

55:20.187 --> 55:22.256
[dramatic music]

55:22.289 --> 55:23.090
Come on.

55:27.328 --> 55:28.896
[Charlie] Hurry, hurry, hurry.

55:28.929 --> 55:29.662
[door squeaking]

55:29.696 --> 55:31.598
- Shit.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

55:31.631 --> 55:32.632
[door banging]

55:32.665 --> 55:35.002
[dramatic music]

55:35.036 --> 55:36.237
Are you expecting someone?

55:37.670 --> 55:39.340
[Trip] Son of a bitch.

55:39.373 --> 55:41.541
[Mama Carmichael] Trip.

55:42.777 --> 55:44.178
[dramatic music]

55:44.211 --> 55:45.046
[gun blaring]

55:45.079 --> 55:45.913
[Charlie groaning]

55:45.946 --> 55:47.882
[Amy] Come on.

55:47.915 --> 55:50.017
All right, son.

55:50.051 --> 55:51.085
That's enough.

55:52.887 --> 55:53.788
Ow.

55:53.821 --> 55:55.022
Stop being such a baby.

55:55.056 --> 55:57.024
Hell, I've never been shot
before.

55:57.058 --> 55:58.859
[Amy] The bullet didn't even
hit you.

56:03.030 --> 56:05.332
Why didn't Trip just pay up?

56:05.366 --> 56:07.001
Probably the same reason he
didn't tell Mama Carmichael.

56:07.034 --> 56:09.937
[door banging]

56:09.970 --> 56:10.971
What are y'all doing here?

56:12.139 --> 56:13.908
I could ask you the same
question, kid.

56:15.276 --> 56:18.112
Oh, I was just driving
home from Cricket's,

56:18.145 --> 56:19.246
I saw the lights on

56:19.280 --> 56:21.782
thought there might be trouble,
boss.

56:21.816 --> 56:24.385
Well, I'm just showing
our outta town guest around.

56:24.418 --> 56:25.652
Nothing to worry about.

56:26.653 --> 56:27.855
Y'all should be more careful.

56:29.056 --> 56:29.924
Excuse me?

56:32.159 --> 56:34.028
Your neck, boss, it looks like
it hurts.

56:35.863 --> 56:37.164
It's just a scratch.

56:39.233 --> 56:41.202
Little hunting accident.

56:43.971 --> 56:46.841
Hey, kid, come on, why
don't you get on home now?

56:46.874 --> 56:48.876
What the hell?

56:48.909 --> 56:51.846
Y'all know there's a storm
coming,

56:53.747 --> 56:54.748
don't get caught in it.

57:03.190 --> 57:04.758
What are these?

57:04.792 --> 57:07.962
Ah, damn, put in the wrong
roll.

57:07.995 --> 57:09.763
Musta mixed up the film.

57:09.797 --> 57:10.764
[Amy] How'd that happened?

57:10.798 --> 57:12.099
I use the same kind.

57:14.068 --> 57:16.337
You use the same film
as the blackmailer?

57:16.370 --> 57:19.039
[dramatic music]

57:21.809 --> 57:22.943
You can't smoke in here.

57:24.378 --> 57:25.713
Do you wanna explain that?

57:25.746 --> 57:27.014
Smoking's bad for ya.

57:27.047 --> 57:28.449
Thanks. I wasn't aware.

57:28.482 --> 57:29.283
[Charlie] Happy to help.

57:29.316 --> 57:31.085
Quite a coincidence.

57:31.118 --> 57:33.154
Or maybe somebody's
trying to make Trip think

57:33.187 --> 57:34.155
I'm the blackmailer.

57:34.188 --> 57:35.256
Slash, kidnapper.

57:38.893 --> 57:40.928
Where did you say you
found that film again?

57:42.263 --> 57:43.164
[clanking]

57:43.197 --> 57:44.365
[dramatic music]

57:44.398 --> 57:45.199
Hello?

57:48.235 --> 57:49.403
Let's go.

57:49.436 --> 57:50.971
[Amy] What about the film?

57:51.005 --> 57:53.040
[Charlie] We can develop
it at my place, come on.

57:59.146 --> 58:01.415
Developing film is a job done in
the dark.

58:03.384 --> 58:05.052
You let in the light too soon,

58:06.253 --> 58:08.055
everything will be exposed.

58:08.088 --> 58:08.923
[Lily] Bear.

58:08.956 --> 58:11.725
[Charlie gasping]

58:23.370 --> 58:26.106
[dramatic music]

58:29.210 --> 58:30.277
Come find me, Bear.

58:30.311 --> 58:31.145
[Charlie gasping]

58:31.178 --> 58:31.879
[dramatic music]

58:31.912 --> 58:35.950
[Charlie's thoughts whispering]

58:38.452 --> 58:39.253
Lily?

58:40.854 --> 58:41.455
Sweetheart.

58:44.091 --> 58:45.025
[Lily laughing]

58:45.059 --> 58:47.061
[Lily] I love you, Bear.

58:49.830 --> 58:50.531
Lily?

58:50.564 --> 58:52.032
[Lily] Come find me, Bear.

58:52.066 --> 58:53.067
[Lily laughing]

58:53.100 --> 58:53.901
Lily?

58:55.970 --> 58:56.804
You okay?

58:58.105 --> 58:59.840
What were you doing?

59:00.908 --> 59:03.277
Trying to call my editor,
your phone doesn't work.

59:07.815 --> 59:08.916
This is a mess.

59:11.151 --> 59:15.256
[Charlie breathing hard]

59:15.289 --> 59:16.523
Why don't we call it a night?

59:38.846 --> 59:40.314
Thanks for letting me crash.

59:40.347 --> 59:44.351
The Marble Motel isn't exactly
hospitable for a single woman.

59:44.385 --> 59:46.186
Yeah, I kinda got that vibe

59:46.220 --> 59:47.988
when they asked me to pay by the
hour.

59:51.892 --> 59:54.395
Sorry, this isn't exactly the
Ritz,

59:54.428 --> 59:56.297
I don't normally do the house
keepin'.

59:56.330 --> 59:57.531
No, it's fine.

01:00:02.136 --> 01:00:04.238
When did your partner,
what was her name again?

01:00:05.606 --> 01:00:06.407
Angela.

01:00:07.574 --> 01:00:08.976
When did Angela leave?

01:00:11.245 --> 01:00:12.146
A couple days ago.

01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:16.050
It's been hard on her
without Lily this past year.

01:00:18.619 --> 01:00:20.154
Why do you ask?

01:00:20.187 --> 01:00:23.090
No reason, I'm a
reporter, I ask questions.

01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:26.060
Nobody ever asks me about my
family.

01:00:32.032 --> 01:00:35.469
So is Lily yours or hers
biologically?

01:00:36.503 --> 01:00:37.304
She's mine.

01:00:39.406 --> 01:00:41.542
That's not what I expected.

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:43.944
Well, it certainly came
as a surprise to me too.

01:00:45.279 --> 01:00:47.981
Was it a onetime
thing, being with a guy?

01:00:48.015 --> 01:00:50.284
Is there any question you
won't ask?

01:00:50.317 --> 01:00:51.118
No.

01:00:55.122 --> 01:00:58.258
All right then, it
was a one night thing,

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.528
but I was married to my best
friend.

01:01:02.663 --> 01:01:04.998
It wasn't romantic or anything.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.501
Jackson was a good man.

01:01:08.969 --> 01:01:11.138
If you can't be in love,

01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:13.374
at least you don't have to be
lonely.

01:01:13.407 --> 01:01:14.475
We both felt that way.

01:01:15.976 --> 01:01:18.045
So he knew you were gay?

01:01:18.078 --> 01:01:21.115
Yeah, of course, I
mean, we had an agreement.

01:01:21.148 --> 01:01:25.319
And one night after we'd
been married awhile,

01:01:25.352 --> 01:01:30.124
we got drunk and gave
it the old college try,

01:01:31.258 --> 01:01:33.227
and it did not go so well.

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.429
[chuckling]

01:01:37.097 --> 01:01:38.332
I mean, I never thought in a
million years

01:01:38.365 --> 01:01:40.401
I'd be able to get pregnant at
that age.

01:01:41.668 --> 01:01:43.670
But when he found out I was,

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:47.007
he was the happiest I'd ever
seen him.

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:50.677
He dropped dead of a heart
attack

01:01:50.712 --> 01:01:53.080
six weeks before Lily was born.

01:01:53.113 --> 01:01:54.481
Jesus.

01:01:54.515 --> 01:01:58.185
Losing a best friend is
about the loneliest thing

01:01:58.218 --> 01:01:59.520
anybody can ever go through.

01:02:01.588 --> 01:02:02.556
Or so I thought.

01:02:06.693 --> 01:02:11.265
But, it did introduce me
to the love of my life.

01:02:12.699 --> 01:02:15.402
Angela is Jackson's sister.

01:02:15.436 --> 01:02:17.004
No shit.

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:19.473
She moved in to help me with
Lily.

01:02:19.506 --> 01:02:21.475
I never thought something so
beautiful

01:02:21.508 --> 01:02:23.544
could come from something so
tragic.

01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:27.147
It musta been a blast
being the only gay couple

01:02:27.181 --> 01:02:28.415
in 100 mile radius.

01:02:32.019 --> 01:02:32.586
I'm kidding.

01:02:36.023 --> 01:02:37.658
I should've done so many
things differently.

01:02:39.727 --> 01:02:42.329
Charlie, you're still
searching.

01:02:42.362 --> 01:02:44.665
The stats, after all this time,

01:02:44.698 --> 01:02:47.167
anyone else would have given
up hope a long time ago.

01:02:54.041 --> 01:02:57.144
I see you, through your
bullshit.

01:02:57.177 --> 01:02:59.747
[somber music]

01:02:59.781 --> 01:03:01.248
You're a good person.

01:03:04.786 --> 01:03:06.253
You don't know me that well.

01:03:10.557 --> 01:03:13.360
I know you shouldn't blame
yourself

01:03:13.393 --> 01:03:14.695
for things you can't control,

01:03:17.064 --> 01:03:18.532
like a parent's mental illness.

01:03:22.135 --> 01:03:23.036
Goodnight, Charlie.

01:03:33.247 --> 01:03:35.750
[dramatic music]

01:03:41.455 --> 01:03:44.157
[Charlie] Goodnight,
sweetheart.

01:03:55.536 --> 01:03:58.372
[knocking on door]

01:04:00.742 --> 01:04:02.175
[Hank] Charlie.

01:04:04.211 --> 01:04:08.215
Charlie, open the door, I
just wanna talk to you, now.

01:04:09.717 --> 01:04:11.251
Cover that up.

01:04:11.285 --> 01:04:12.686
[knocking on door]

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.087
[Hank] I know you're in there.

01:04:18.292 --> 01:04:19.126
[knocking on door]

01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:20.427
Just a minute!

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.395
Open the damn door!

01:04:26.233 --> 01:04:26.834
Charlie.

01:04:28.368 --> 01:04:30.504
A bit early for a house call.

01:04:30.537 --> 01:04:32.707
Well, we got a complaint.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.509
There was an intruder at
the Carmichael's last night,

01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:37.845
you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

01:04:37.879 --> 01:04:38.679
Nope.

01:04:41.749 --> 01:04:43.851
Mind if I look around?

01:04:43.885 --> 01:04:46.186
Now is not really a good time.

01:04:46.219 --> 01:04:46.788
Why is that?

01:04:48.188 --> 01:04:49.690
Not really in the mood for
company.

01:04:54.328 --> 01:04:55.462
And who the hell are you?

01:04:57.431 --> 01:04:59.666
Happy to answer that,
once you have a warrant.

01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:04.706
[suspenseful music]

01:05:04.739 --> 01:05:07.641
I'm warning you, it's just a
matter of time.

01:05:07.674 --> 01:05:09.543
You fucked with the Carmichaels,
Charlie.

01:05:10.677 --> 01:05:11.545
You're gonna regret it.

01:05:12.947 --> 01:05:14.314
Get off my property, Hank.

01:05:22.422 --> 01:05:25.392
Let's get that film developed.

01:05:25.425 --> 01:05:26.861
It's just the one image on the
role.

01:05:32.366 --> 01:05:33.700
[Amy] You know that place?

01:05:35.202 --> 01:05:36.637
[Charlie] Hell, that could be
anywhere.

01:05:38.271 --> 01:05:38.906
I have an idea.

01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:45.245
[book slamming]

01:05:45.278 --> 01:05:45.847
Find anything yet?

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.714
Not yet.

01:05:47.949 --> 01:05:49.884
The local press coverage
is offensively light.

01:05:52.586 --> 01:05:54.187
[Charlie groaning]

01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:55.355
I may need some caffeine.

01:05:56.556 --> 01:05:59.259
[dramatic music]

01:06:05.298 --> 01:06:05.900
What is it?

01:06:07.735 --> 01:06:09.503
Coffee would be great, grab me
a cup?

01:06:12.439 --> 01:06:13.240
Alright.

01:06:16.443 --> 01:06:19.781
[dramatic music continues]

01:06:48.275 --> 01:06:48.876
Fuck.

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:54.414
Hey, I didn't mean to scare
you.

01:06:55.449 --> 01:06:56.249
What are you doing?

01:06:56.283 --> 01:06:56.884
Nothing.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.821
Can't drink those in here.

01:07:04.624 --> 01:07:05.827
Definitely learned my lesson.

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:06.761
[both laughing]

01:07:06.794 --> 01:07:08.963
[Woman] Then she went to call
him back.

01:07:14.836 --> 01:07:17.705
Charlie, I need to talk
to you about something.

01:07:17.739 --> 01:07:18.840
I don't wanna send you over the
edge,

01:07:18.873 --> 01:07:21.575
but I just read something
and it explains a lot about

01:07:21.608 --> 01:07:23.577
- what's been going on.
- I'll be damned.

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:24.478
What?

01:07:24.511 --> 01:07:26.413
Come here, look at this.

01:07:26.446 --> 01:07:28.816
[somber music]

01:07:30.084 --> 01:07:31.351
I know where we're going.

01:07:32.987 --> 01:07:34.421
Oh shit.

01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:37.524
[dramatic music]

01:07:37.557 --> 01:07:38.391
I'll be right back.

01:07:38.425 --> 01:07:39.493
[Charlie] Seriously?

01:07:39.526 --> 01:07:40.427
You gave me coffee.

01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:42.830
Hurry.

01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:57.444
Braden.

01:07:57.477 --> 01:07:59.981
[dramatic music]

01:08:11.025 --> 01:08:13.027
Charlie, I don't think
we should go in there.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:13.995
[Charlie] What are you talking
about?

01:08:14.028 --> 01:08:15.695
Both of you need to hold it
right there.

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:17.564
Braden, I told you I had this
handled.

01:08:17.596 --> 01:08:18.899
Amy, you're working with him?

01:08:18.933 --> 01:08:20.700
Look, put your hands
up and walk towards me.

01:08:20.734 --> 01:08:22.536
Back off, let me talk to her.

01:08:22.569 --> 01:08:24.371
I trusted you.

01:08:24.404 --> 01:08:25.038
You can still trust me.

01:08:25.072 --> 01:08:25.973
Bullshit.

01:08:26.006 --> 01:08:27.541
Look, Amy, let me do my job.

01:08:27.573 --> 01:08:28.408
Shut up, Braden.

01:08:29.944 --> 01:08:31.411
Charlie, there's
something you should know.

01:08:31.444 --> 01:08:34.081
[thunder clapping]

01:08:38.417 --> 01:08:39.252
You're scaring her.

01:08:39.287 --> 01:08:40.720
The situation's gotten outta
control.

01:08:40.755 --> 01:08:41.923
Just let me talk to her alone,

01:08:41.956 --> 01:08:43.590
I'll bring her back out, I
promise.

01:08:45.026 --> 01:08:45.792
Five minutes.

01:08:46.961 --> 01:08:49.831
[suspenseful music]

01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:51.598
[Amy] Charlie?

01:08:51.631 --> 01:08:52.532
Dispatch, 742, we got two
females, one white, one black,

01:08:52.566 --> 01:08:53.600
entering the distillery.

01:08:56.904 --> 01:08:59.573
[suspenseful music]

01:08:59.606 --> 01:09:01.474
Charlie, Charlie,

01:09:01.508 --> 01:09:02.977
I think there's some
fucked up shit going on

01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:03.711
and you're in the middle of it.

01:09:03.743 --> 01:09:05.645
Yeah, no kidding, sweetheart.

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:07.747
[Amy] You told me
Angela left you last week.

01:09:07.782 --> 01:09:10.852
Do not bring my family into
this, Amy, I swear to God.

01:09:10.885 --> 01:09:14.121
I have to Charlie, I'm
worried you're confused

01:09:14.154 --> 01:09:16.791
and Elodie's kidnappers
are using Lily against you.

01:09:16.823 --> 01:09:19.693
[Lily] Come find me, Bear.

01:09:19.727 --> 01:09:20.660
Did you hear that?

01:09:20.694 --> 01:09:21.528
[siren blaring]

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.697
Son of a bitch! Goddammit,
Braden.

01:09:24.799 --> 01:09:27.466
Charlie! Wait, just wait.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.805
[dramatic music continues]

01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:36.143
[Charlie] Okay. Lily?

01:09:36.176 --> 01:09:37.979
[Lily] Come find me, Bear.

01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:39.145
Sweetheart!

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.581
She's alive, she's here.

01:09:42.716 --> 01:09:44.018
Lily?

01:09:44.051 --> 01:09:45.752
I knew it, I found her.

01:09:50.157 --> 01:09:50.957
Lily?

01:09:53.027 --> 01:09:53.794
Lily?

01:09:59.166 --> 01:10:01.468
[dramatic music]

01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:02.103
Baby.

01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:04.471
Lily.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.507
It's okay, I got you.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.777
[soft music]

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:11.946
You're safe now, sweetheart.

01:10:15.182 --> 01:10:16.117
You're safe.

01:10:26.493 --> 01:10:27.094
Charlie!

01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:30.031
You okay?

01:10:34.567 --> 01:10:36.003
She was just here.

01:10:38.538 --> 01:10:41.042
[dramatic music]

01:10:43.044 --> 01:10:43.878
What is it?

01:10:45.246 --> 01:10:46.747
Oh God.

01:10:46.781 --> 01:10:47.748
Don't look.

01:10:49.216 --> 01:10:50.617
- Lily,
- Come on boys,

01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:52.753
- it's in here.
- Lily.

01:10:52.787 --> 01:10:53.687
Lily.

01:10:53.721 --> 01:10:54.521
[Amy] Leave her alone!

01:10:54.554 --> 01:10:55.222
[Hank] Hands up.

01:10:55.256 --> 01:10:56.090
Get the hell outta the way.

01:10:56.123 --> 01:10:57.258
[Charlie] Lily, Lily!

01:10:57.291 --> 01:10:59.060
[Hank] Calm the hell down,
let's go!

01:10:59.093 --> 01:10:59.827
- Charlie, it's gonna be okay.
- Lily, Lily.

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.694
Take her the hell outta here.

01:11:00.728 --> 01:11:01.695
- No, no, no, no.
- Come on, let's go.

01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:05.099
- Don't fight me, now.
- No, no, Lily, Lily!

01:11:05.132 --> 01:11:06.666
- No, let go, don't!
- Come on, let's go, hey!

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:07.969
[Charlie] Lily, no!

01:11:08.002 --> 01:11:09.502
Let go!

01:11:09.536 --> 01:11:12.139
[thunder rumbling]

01:11:17.211 --> 01:11:19.646
[talking on police scanner]

01:11:19.679 --> 01:11:20.680
[dramatic music]

01:11:20.715 --> 01:11:21.648
Holy shit.

01:11:24.051 --> 01:11:24.952
Boys, we got a body.

01:11:27.587 --> 01:11:30.925
[dramatic music continues]

01:11:36.764 --> 01:11:39.499
[Charlie crying]

01:11:49.243 --> 01:11:51.012
[Charlie] Some say time is
relative.

01:11:52.179 --> 01:11:53.981
Some say time is an illusion.

01:11:54.015 --> 01:11:55.983
[clock ticking]

01:11:56.017 --> 01:11:58.953
Well, they're both right.

01:11:58.986 --> 01:12:01.621
[Charlie's thoughts whispering]

01:12:01.654 --> 01:12:02.990
[clock ticking]

01:12:03.024 --> 01:12:03.791
[Man] It's her.

01:12:04.925 --> 01:12:07.660
[dramatic music]

01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:17.537
How about you start
telling me the truth.

01:12:22.243 --> 01:12:24.745
I know that I've been messed
up lately,

01:12:24.779 --> 01:12:26.313
and I've been seen some strange
things,

01:12:26.347 --> 01:12:29.083
but, I'm not a killer.

01:12:31.318 --> 01:12:33.788
I would never hurt Elodie
Carmichael.

01:12:38.359 --> 01:12:40.294
It wasn't Elodie Carmichael.

01:12:40.327 --> 01:12:42.329
[people talking]

01:12:42.363 --> 01:12:43.663
[Man] Sue you first.

01:12:43.696 --> 01:12:44.732
[Woman] Are you kidding me?

01:12:44.765 --> 01:12:46.300
If you had done your fucking
job.

01:12:46.333 --> 01:12:49.070
[woman talking]

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:51.105
[Hank] What the fuck?

01:12:51.138 --> 01:12:52.773
How in the hell did she get back
here?

01:12:52.807 --> 01:12:53.974
[dramatic music]

01:12:54.008 --> 01:12:55.142
Where did you get this?

01:12:56.710 --> 01:13:00.214
What is wrong with you
people, where is my daughter?

01:13:00.247 --> 01:13:03.084
[Amy] Let me speak to her,
or I swear, I'm calling CNN.

01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:04.819
Get these off of me!

01:13:04.852 --> 01:13:06.954
[Hank] You got two minutes,
then I want some damn answers.

01:13:06.987 --> 01:13:07.788
Excuse you.

01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:11.658
Get these damn restraints off of
her.

01:13:21.068 --> 01:13:23.270
And close the door after you.

01:13:30.978 --> 01:13:32.313
Hey Charlie.

01:13:32.346 --> 01:13:35.116
I'm not saying another
word until I talk to Angela.

01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:38.252
I'm afraid that can't happen.

01:13:38.285 --> 01:13:40.855
[somber music]

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:43.924
Charlie,

01:13:45.025 --> 01:13:47.328
I'm gonna show you Lily's case
file.

01:13:49.797 --> 01:13:51.332
But I just want to warn you,

01:13:51.365 --> 01:13:53.666
some things may not make sense
right now.

01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:19.927
[dramatic music]

01:14:22.863 --> 01:14:25.099
[soft music]

01:14:28.068 --> 01:14:30.703
[watch ticking]

01:14:35.476 --> 01:14:38.746
[soft music continues]

01:15:00.534 --> 01:15:02.736
Hey, I'll be right back.

01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:10.978
[dramatic music]

01:15:23.857 --> 01:15:25.159
Hey, where is she?

01:15:27.995 --> 01:15:28.963
Where's Lily?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.235
I just saw her.

01:15:39.139 --> 01:15:40.407
Do you know what year it is?

01:15:41.442 --> 01:15:42.810
1997.

01:15:45.179 --> 01:15:47.181
Do you know how old you are.

01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:48.015
43.

01:15:49.116 --> 01:15:49.917
45.

01:15:51.518 --> 01:15:52.486
I don't know.

01:16:10.304 --> 01:16:11.972
Look in the mirror.

01:16:16.176 --> 01:16:18.112
[dramatic music]

01:16:18.145 --> 01:16:18.979
[Charlie gasping]

01:16:19.013 --> 01:16:19.947
Oh my God.

01:16:26.287 --> 01:16:27.288
Oh my God.

01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:29.890
[somber music]

01:16:32.893 --> 01:16:34.328
Elodie's kidnapping triggered
something

01:16:34.361 --> 01:16:35.496
called lucid mania.

01:16:37.331 --> 01:16:40.034
It's a symptom of your
Alzheimer's Disease.

01:16:43.904 --> 01:16:45.139
A symptom of my disease?

01:16:48.942 --> 01:16:52.379
Finding out my family is dead

01:16:54.148 --> 01:16:56.050
is a symptom of my disease?

01:16:56.083 --> 01:16:59.153
[Charlie crying]

01:16:59.186 --> 01:16:59.987
Amy...

01:17:02.222 --> 01:17:03.223
I'm sorry.

01:17:05.492 --> 01:17:06.360
[Hank] Time's up.

01:17:09.997 --> 01:17:11.865
I'll be right outside.

01:17:21.342 --> 01:17:23.577
You know, you may have a
lot of these people fooled,

01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:25.546
but I've been around awhile.

01:17:25.579 --> 01:17:27.848
It's time for you to start
telling me what you know.

01:17:29.983 --> 01:17:31.552
[Braden] It does seem like
these crimes are connected,

01:17:31.585 --> 01:17:32.986
if you'd be willing to cooperate

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.521
- with us-
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:39.293
Am I under arrest?

01:17:41.929 --> 01:17:42.496
Not yet.

01:17:44.131 --> 01:17:46.934
Then you can all go to hell.

01:18:22.269 --> 01:18:23.637
Look at this place.

01:18:37.151 --> 01:18:38.118
All this time

01:18:41.121 --> 01:18:43.223
I couldn't see what was
right in front of me.

01:18:51.031 --> 01:18:52.099
I couldn't see the truth.

01:19:01.008 --> 01:19:01.709
All this time.

01:19:08.081 --> 01:19:10.317
What was the point of it all?

01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:12.619
[soft music]

01:19:40.782 --> 01:19:43.383
[Lily] Bear, come help
me finish my dollhouse.

01:19:45.319 --> 01:19:47.287
[Charlie] Not tonight,
sweetheart.

01:19:47.321 --> 01:19:50.290
[Lily] But you said that last
night.

01:19:51.658 --> 01:19:54.762
[Charlie] We'll finish
it tomorrow, promise.

01:19:54.796 --> 01:19:58.031
[soft music continues]

01:20:15.282 --> 01:20:18.252
[camera whirring]

01:20:18.285 --> 01:20:21.355
[soft music continues]

01:20:37.671 --> 01:20:38.438
My baby.

01:20:39.506 --> 01:20:42.209
[Charlie crying]

01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:56.290
[dramatic music]

01:20:57.658 --> 01:21:00.260
[Angela] Hey, hey, where is
she?

01:21:02.864 --> 01:21:03.630
Where's Lily?

01:21:08.168 --> 01:21:09.069
She was just here.

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:15.375

01:21:21.448 --> 01:21:22.884
[dramatic music]

01:21:22.917 --> 01:21:25.619
Lily, sweetheart, can you hear
me?

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:29.356
It's time to come home,
baby, please answer me, Lily.

01:21:31.191 --> 01:21:32.192
[dogs barking]

No!

[Charlie crying]

01:21:44.504 --> 01:21:47.608
[soft music continues]

01:22:05.893 --> 01:22:06.660
It's too late.

01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:11.231
I can't do this anymore, I can't
take it.

01:22:11.264 --> 01:22:13.233
'Cause I look at you and I see
you sleeping on that beach.

01:22:13.266 --> 01:22:15.469
She was my baby too.

01:22:15.502 --> 01:22:16.637
- I'm her mom
- I know!

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:17.739
And you won't talk to me.

01:22:17.772 --> 01:22:18.873
And you won't look at me.

01:22:18.906 --> 01:22:20.273
Nobody even cares.

01:22:20.307 --> 01:22:22.442
How do you think that makes me
feel?

01:22:22.476 --> 01:22:23.343
How?

01:22:23.377 --> 01:22:24.578
I don't know.

01:22:24.611 --> 01:22:26.881
Well, I can't take
it, this is killing me,

01:22:26.914 --> 01:22:27.915
this is killing me.

01:22:27.949 --> 01:22:31.218

01:23:10.457 --> 01:23:11.258
Oh my God,

01:23:12.727 --> 01:23:13.527
oh my God.

01:23:14.461 --> 01:23:15.328
No, no, no.

01:23:16.496 --> 01:23:19.433
No, no, Angela, no, no, my
Angela, no.

01:23:20.935 --> 01:23:21.836
God, Angela.

01:23:23.838 --> 01:23:26.874

[soft music]

01:24:16.556 --> 01:24:17.892
I brought you some breakfast.

01:24:24.799 --> 01:24:25.867
Where did you find this?

01:24:27.601 --> 01:24:29.336
Don't worry, you forgot to
load it.

01:24:29.369 --> 01:24:32.006
I'm a Democrat, Charlie, I
just use it to scare people.

01:24:32.039 --> 01:24:33.406
Unbelievable.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.441
You ever try something like
that again,

01:24:34.474 --> 01:24:36.510
I'm gonna kill you with
my bare hands, got it?

01:24:38.345 --> 01:24:41.949
What do you care? You got your
story.

01:24:41.983 --> 01:24:44.852
Not yet, Elodie's still
missing.

01:24:44.886 --> 01:24:48.421
And the kidnapper knows
what happened to Lily.

01:24:48.455 --> 01:24:50.057
Don't you care about the truth?

01:24:50.091 --> 01:24:54.829
The truth is they're gone
and they're never coming back.

01:24:57.631 --> 01:24:59.000
What about saving a little
girl?

01:25:00.168 --> 01:25:03.070
I can't save her, I couldn't
even say my own family.

01:25:04.504 --> 01:25:07.541
Fine, go ahead, waste your
life away,

01:25:07.574 --> 01:25:09.010
what's left of it anyway.

01:25:09.043 --> 01:25:11.913
There's nothing left. That's
the point.

01:25:13.948 --> 01:25:14.749
God.

01:25:20.955 --> 01:25:23.858
I never told you the whole
story

01:25:23.891 --> 01:25:25.827
about how I met Sylvia
Carmichael.

01:25:29.462 --> 01:25:32.967
I met her at the Metropolitan
Psychiatric Center.

01:25:34.668 --> 01:25:37.370
That's the state hospital
for crazy people.

01:25:37.404 --> 01:25:40.107
Sylvia didn't belong there,
she wasn't crazy or poor,

01:25:41.943 --> 01:25:43.577
but it's all my mom could
afford.

01:25:45.746 --> 01:25:47.982
I know what it's like to
lose your family, Charlie.

01:25:50.051 --> 01:25:51.052
We're not the same.

01:25:53.553 --> 01:25:54.856
Don't you think I know that?

01:25:56.123 --> 01:25:59.492
This isn't about you, or
me, or my mom, or Sylvia,

01:25:59.526 --> 01:26:01.963
or all the people who fucked up
our lives,

01:26:01.996 --> 01:26:04.664
it's about what we can do to
save one.

01:26:04.698 --> 01:26:06.901
That girl, Charlie, she has a
chance.

01:26:09.469 --> 01:26:11.138
I told you, I can't.

01:26:11.172 --> 01:26:12.439
No, you won't.

01:26:12.472 --> 01:26:13.440
Fine, I won't.

01:26:17.778 --> 01:26:19.814
Someone once told me
you can't blame yourself

01:26:19.847 --> 01:26:22.116
for things that are out of your
control.

01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:24.584
[clock chiming]

01:26:24.618 --> 01:26:27.955
Well, we can't control the past,
Charlie, we both know that.

01:26:27.989 --> 01:26:29.090
[Lily laughing]

01:26:29.123 --> 01:26:32.760
But, this isn't the past, this
is now,

01:26:32.793 --> 01:26:35.495
and we can change what happens.

01:26:35.528 --> 01:26:37.899
[all laughing]

01:26:37.932 --> 01:26:39.399
Charlie, please.

01:26:41.235 --> 01:26:42.702
They say time is relative.

01:26:44.038 --> 01:26:45.172
[clock ticking]

01:26:45.206 --> 01:26:46.874
Maybe it's been long enough.

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:50.011
Maybe it's time to let go.

01:26:55.116 --> 01:26:57.484
You really want help
from a crazy old lady?

01:26:57.517 --> 01:26:58.819
Crazy's all I know.

01:27:03.024 --> 01:27:07.728
Okay, sweetheart, but
we're taking your car.

01:27:07.762 --> 01:27:09.629
Take a shower first, Jesus.

01:27:11.132 --> 01:27:13.935
And stop calling me sweetheart.

01:27:13.968 --> 01:27:15.970
Suspect-wise, there's Belinda.

01:27:16.003 --> 01:27:17.504
[Charlie] Who has an alibi.

01:27:17.537 --> 01:27:19.173
Plus, the timing doesn't add
up.

01:27:19.206 --> 01:27:21.108
If he ran her outta town two
decades ago,

01:27:21.142 --> 01:27:22.143
why make 'em pay now?

01:27:24.078 --> 01:27:24.879
What about Walker?

01:27:26.914 --> 01:27:28.581
It's possible.

01:27:28.615 --> 01:27:31.118
But, I don't know, he seemed
just a little too determined

01:27:31.152 --> 01:27:33.120
to lock me up, you know?

01:27:33.154 --> 01:27:35.655
Like he really believed I had
something to do with all this.

01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:37.959
Maybe he was trying to frame
you.

01:27:37.992 --> 01:27:41.062
You really think he could
pull off something like that?

01:27:41.095 --> 01:27:43.563
Poor guy doesn't know his ass
from a hole in the ground.

01:27:43.596 --> 01:27:44.564
Fair point.

01:27:47.168 --> 01:27:48.535
What about that bartender?

01:27:49.703 --> 01:27:51.238
Cricket, nah, she wouldn't
hurt a fly,

01:27:51.272 --> 01:27:52.974
she's just nosy as hell.

01:27:53.007 --> 01:27:54.507
Yeah, I didn't think so.

01:27:54.541 --> 01:27:56.576
It's just, who could it be then?

01:27:56.609 --> 01:27:58.980
Elodie didn't just get up
and walk off on her own.

01:27:59.013 --> 01:28:01.215
Dammit, I feel like we're so
close.

01:28:01.248 --> 01:28:02.149
Hand me that folder.

01:28:06.619 --> 01:28:09.156
[dramatic music]

01:28:10.992 --> 01:28:11.892
Holy shit.

01:28:12.893 --> 01:28:13.693
What?

01:28:19.066 --> 01:28:20.835
Oh my God, it's her.

01:28:20.868 --> 01:28:24.038
She's at Serenity Point,
she's been there the whole time.

01:28:24.071 --> 01:28:25.206
How did we miss that?

01:28:25.239 --> 01:28:26.340
Belinda must've been hiding
her there

01:28:26.374 --> 01:28:29.710
and obviously got that past
the Sheriff's Department.

01:28:29.744 --> 01:28:30.878
[Amy] What are you doing?

01:28:30.911 --> 01:28:32.013
We're going to Serenity Point.

01:28:32.046 --> 01:28:34.248
Don't you think we need
to let the police handle it?

01:28:34.281 --> 01:28:36.250
Why, because they done such
a great job of it so far?

01:28:36.283 --> 01:28:40.254
Listen, I have waited long
enough to find out the truth,

01:28:40.287 --> 01:28:41.122
don't you think?

01:28:42.757 --> 01:28:43.656
We'll take my car.

01:28:51.732 --> 01:28:53.968
So what's the plan? Bust
in and rescue Elodie?

01:28:55.102 --> 01:28:56.703
[Charlie] Yeah, sounds good to
me.

01:28:57.637 --> 01:28:59.606
You do know how old you are
now, right?

01:29:02.076 --> 01:29:02.943
[Charlie] Let's go.

01:29:06.679 --> 01:29:08.716
18 years later,

01:29:08.749 --> 01:29:10.284
he's gonna finally pay for his
sins.

01:29:11.684 --> 01:29:12.585
Well, you know what
you're doing, don't you?

01:29:12.619 --> 01:29:13.287
You'll be fine.

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.188
[Young Man] Okay, mama.

01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:15.990
Don't worry about it, not a
big deal.

01:29:17.358 --> 01:29:19.559
Get him here, lure him in.

01:29:21.128 --> 01:29:22.830
Make mama real proud.

01:29:22.863 --> 01:29:23.831
[Troy] Okay, I will.

01:29:24.899 --> 01:29:25.698
Is that?

01:29:28.635 --> 01:29:29.236
Troy?

darkly,

but then face to face."

01:29:48.956 --> 01:29:50.925
I'm sorry about all this,
boss.

01:29:50.958 --> 01:29:53.693
Mama said better safe than
stupid.

01:29:53.727 --> 01:29:55.329
So Elodie wasn't kidnapped?

01:29:56.696 --> 01:29:57.298
No.

01:29:59.133 --> 01:30:00.101
What about Charlie's daughter?

01:30:00.134 --> 01:30:02.336
Y'all are too nosy
for your own damn good.

01:30:03.237 --> 01:30:07.041
This one, I don't like the mouth
on her.

01:30:07.074 --> 01:30:08.409
Shut her up.

01:30:08.442 --> 01:30:09.310
[Troy] You got it.

01:30:10.878 --> 01:30:14.415
Hey, what are you doing?

01:30:14.448 --> 01:30:15.149
That's not necessary, you don't
have to-

01:30:15.182 --> 01:30:16.016
- No.

01:30:16.050 --> 01:30:17.017
Troy.

01:30:17.051 --> 01:30:17.718
- Don't.
- Hold still.

01:30:17.751 --> 01:30:18.419
Come on, you didn't have to

01:30:18.452 --> 01:30:19.453
- do that, all right.
- Sorry.

01:30:19.487 --> 01:30:21.388
Listen, we just wanna
know what my daughter

01:30:21.422 --> 01:30:22.356
has to do with all this.

01:30:22.389 --> 01:30:24.992

you must understand.

daughter.

I'm sorry you had to find
out the truth like this.

What are you talking
about? What is the truth?

01:30:51.318 --> 01:30:53.686
Y'all gonna know soon enough.

01:30:55.256 --> 01:30:56.991
Y'all know how this is
gonna go down, right?

Yes, ma'am.

Sure you're up for this?

about,

fine.

you.

Belinda.

better?

there, Mama Carmichael,

01:32:28.849 --> 01:32:33.220
All right Belinda, I'm sure
we can work something out.

01:32:33.254 --> 01:32:35.456
You had your chance, do your
usual,

01:32:35.489 --> 01:32:37.558
write a check, make it go away.

01:32:37.591 --> 01:32:39.326
Didn't y'all read my note?

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.262
What is she talking about,
son?

01:32:41.295 --> 01:32:43.030
I don't know.

01:32:43.063 --> 01:32:45.499
Hmm, shoulda known your snake
of a child wouldn't tell ya.

01:32:45.532 --> 01:32:48.068
She's just a stupid whore,
mother.

01:32:48.102 --> 01:32:50.571
Well, I may be a whore,
but at least I'm honest.

01:32:50.604 --> 01:32:52.806
I just want what was promised
for our son.

01:32:55.843 --> 01:32:59.179
Oh, I'm sorry, how rude of me?

01:32:59.213 --> 01:33:03.250
You haven't met your grandson
yet, have you Mama Carmichael?

01:33:03.284 --> 01:33:04.084
This is Troy.

01:33:05.352 --> 01:33:07.221
[Trip] This is bullshit. She's
lying.

01:33:12.393 --> 01:33:13.894
How much?

01:33:13.927 --> 01:33:15.095
[Trip scoffing]

01:33:15.129 --> 01:33:18.165
Oh, well, Carmichael sins are
expensive,

01:33:18.198 --> 01:33:21.135
and the price just went up,
gonna cost you everything,

01:33:21.168 --> 01:33:22.836
'cause last I heard,

01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:26.173
there ain't no statute
of limitations on murder.

01:33:26.206 --> 01:33:27.308
Ain't that right, Sheriff?

01:33:30.144 --> 01:33:32.946
Go on now, you gonna tell
'em about what you did

01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:34.481
to Charlie's little girl.

01:33:34.515 --> 01:33:35.416
What?

01:33:35.449 --> 01:33:36.617
That was an accident.

01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:37.484
What is she talking about?

01:33:37.518 --> 01:33:39.086
What is she talking about?

01:33:39.119 --> 01:33:40.921
It was no accident.

01:33:40.954 --> 01:33:43.057
Your pervert of a son had his
way

01:33:43.090 --> 01:33:44.925
with that poor little girl.

01:33:44.958 --> 01:33:46.093
Is that true?

01:33:46.126 --> 01:33:47.895
Before tossing her body into
one

01:33:47.928 --> 01:33:48.797
- of your whiskey barrels
- Shut up.

01:33:48.862 --> 01:33:51.965
and then went running to you
for help.

01:33:51.999 --> 01:33:53.367
Shut your mouth, whore.

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.501
You ain't got no proof of that.

01:33:54.535 --> 01:33:57.171
You'd risk your own daughter's
life just to shut me up?

01:33:57.204 --> 01:33:58.505
Everybody just put your damn
guns down.

01:33:58.539 --> 01:34:00.507
Son, put that pistol away.

01:34:00.541 --> 01:34:01.442
She's a goddamn liar, mama.

01:34:01.475 --> 01:34:02.343
Wait, wait.

01:34:04.978 --> 01:34:05.579
Wait.

01:34:07.047 --> 01:34:09.583
I know that she's telling you
the truth.

01:34:12.119 --> 01:34:12.953
I can prove it.

01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:19.526
[Elodie breathing hard]

01:34:24.531 --> 01:34:26.900
What are you doing, Elodie?

01:34:30.404 --> 01:34:33.006
[somber music]

01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:38.245
[gasping]

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:48.255
Put your fucking clothes back
on!

01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:52.893
Hey, they didn't give me these
bruises.

01:34:57.498 --> 01:34:58.532
My father did.

01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:02.302
He's been ra...

01:35:02.336 --> 01:35:03.537
[Elodie hyperventilating]

01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:05.072
It's all right, sweetheart.

01:35:05.105 --> 01:35:07.408
He can't hurt you now, go on and
tell 'em.

01:35:12.613 --> 01:35:14.581
Why are you doing this to me?

01:35:14.615 --> 01:35:18.118
[somber music continues]

01:35:22.022 --> 01:35:24.425
He's been raping me
since I was nine-years-old.

01:35:27.127 --> 01:35:31.365
Damn Trip, first Charlie's
daughter, now your own.

01:35:31.398 --> 01:35:32.232
Shut up.

01:35:32.266 --> 01:35:33.534
[gun blaring]

01:35:33.567 --> 01:35:34.368
No!

01:35:36.336 --> 01:35:37.137
Mama!

01:35:38.205 --> 01:35:39.606
Mama, wake up.

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.674
Mama!

01:35:40.708 --> 01:35:42.242
Mama, mama.

01:35:42.276 --> 01:35:43.243
- Mama, wake up.
- Elodie,

01:35:43.277 --> 01:35:44.645
everything's gonna be
okay, just come here.

01:35:44.678 --> 01:35:47.114
You lying son of a bitch.

01:35:47.147 --> 01:35:48.015
Come here.

01:35:48.048 --> 01:35:48.682
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:35:48.716 --> 01:35:50.350
Put the gun down, boy.

01:35:50.384 --> 01:35:51.218
[Mama Carmichael] Elodie,
everything's gonna be okay.

01:35:51.251 --> 01:35:53.153
I would rather die than go
with you.

01:35:54.121 --> 01:35:55.022
Oh, is that right?

01:35:55.055 --> 01:35:56.557
No, Trip, no!

01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:59.761
[gun blaring]

01:35:59.794 --> 01:36:02.629
[Charlie groaning]

01:36:04.097 --> 01:36:06.533
[Trip groaning]

01:36:08.235 --> 01:36:10.738
[dramatic music]

01:36:12.239 --> 01:36:14.107
Get an ambulance down here, now!

01:36:14.141 --> 01:36:16.176
[Amy] Charlie, it's okay, it's
okay.

01:36:16.210 --> 01:36:18.078
[Troy] Mama, mama.

01:36:18.111 --> 01:36:20.180
[Amy] It's okay, that
son of a bitch shot at you.

01:36:20.214 --> 01:36:23.450
I'm taking you to the
hospital this time.

01:36:27.454 --> 01:36:28.756
[Charlie] History repeats
itself.

01:36:42.569 --> 01:36:44.238
So what do you think?

01:36:44.271 --> 01:36:45.740
I think you got your story.

01:36:56.483 --> 01:36:58.685
There's so many things I
wish I could say to them.

01:37:04.291 --> 01:37:07.160
They were lucky to have you.

01:37:07.194 --> 01:37:09.329
Some people spend their whole
lives

01:37:09.363 --> 01:37:12.232
looking for what you had,
and they never find it.

01:37:19.306 --> 01:37:21.575
[soft music]

01:37:28.115 --> 01:37:30.517
Don't try and get sappy with me.

01:37:30.551 --> 01:37:32.586
Come inside, something I wanna
show you.

01:37:42.596 --> 01:37:46.366
I think it's time we finish
this thing, don't you?

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.770
[Charlie] Yeah, it's time.

01:37:49.904 --> 01:37:53.206
[soft music continues]

01:38:29.844 --> 01:38:32.512
[dramatic music]

01:38:36.784 --> 01:38:39.252
[soft music]

01:38:56.536 --> 01:38:58.305
There's my sweet girl.

01:38:59.606 --> 01:39:00.540
[Charlie laughing]

01:39:00.574 --> 01:39:03.210
[Lily laughing]

01:39:06.814 --> 01:39:08.382
[dramatic music]

01:39:08.415 --> 01:39:11.385
[staple gun clicking]

01:39:13.955 --> 01:39:15.589
They say that time is relative.

01:39:16.791 --> 01:39:19.159
When you have kids, time speeds
up.

01:39:20.694 --> 01:39:21.495
They're born,

01:39:22.964 --> 01:39:25.265
they grow up, then you blink.

01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:29.369
[Charlie's thoughts whispering]

01:39:29.403 --> 01:39:30.537
and they're gone.

01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:33.273
