WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.303
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, people.

00:02.336 --> 00:03.337
Time to reboot and refresh.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.273
As we all know by now,

00:05.306 --> 00:06.340
Jane was accidentally
 artificially inseminated

00:06.374 --> 00:08.109
with Rafael's sperm.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.610
Meanwhile, Rafael's
 ex-wife Petra

00:09.643 --> 00:13.081
intentionally inseminated
 herself with his sperm,

00:13.114 --> 00:14.482
because she
 really does love him.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.117
I know, it's crazier

00:16.149 --> 00:18.052
than anything Jane
 could dream up.

00:18.086 --> 00:20.121
And remember, she's in grad
 school to become a writer.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.656
Oh, and speaking
 of unexpected developments...

00:22.690 --> 00:24.258
Jane?
Grandpa?

00:24.292 --> 00:25.659
Rogelio's mother
 outed his father.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.328
Your grandfather is gay.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.330
So, yeah, mama drama.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.365
Oh, and speaking of,
 Rafael just learned

00:31.399 --> 00:33.334
his mother Elena is
 the international crime boss

00:33.367 --> 00:35.103
known as Mutter.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.671
And Detective Michael has just
 realized that as well.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.307
It's her!
 But unfortunately,

00:39.340 --> 00:40.808
they did not get there
 fast enough.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.844
So let's hope Rafael's okay.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.513
Let's begin today
 with a portrait

00:45.546 --> 00:48.349
of the writer as a young woman.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.819
It should be noted
 that 232 hours of babysitting,

00:51.852 --> 00:54.288
all of her Quinceañera
 gift money,

00:54.322 --> 00:57.625
and three weeks
 of comparison shopping

00:57.658 --> 01:00.261
had led young
 Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:00.294 --> 01:02.396
to this very moment.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.135
Now I can write anywhere

01:07.168 --> 01:08.736
anytime.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.239
And so she took
 her first laptop everywhere,

01:11.272 --> 01:13.407
waiting for the muse to strike.

01:13.441 --> 01:17.245
And she waited.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.746
And still waiting.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.314
Seriously, anytime, muse.

01:20.348 --> 01:23.251
She's ready.

01:23.284 --> 01:27.288
And just when she was
 beginning to feel defeated,

01:27.321 --> 01:29.290
there it was.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.233
That's when Jane learned
 a very important lesson.

01:39.267 --> 01:43.271
You never know
 when inspiration will strike.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.774
And let me tell you,
 when it happens...

01:48.676 --> 01:50.678
...there's nothing
 quite like the rush

01:50.711 --> 01:53.447
of finding the flow.

02:18.639 --> 02:22.776
A night like this is just
 the best feeling in the world.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.746
Well, to a woman
 who's never had sex.

02:25.779 --> 02:29.317
Ah!

02:30.584 --> 02:33.153
*

02:35.389 --> 02:37.325
Because I finally
cracked my novel.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.227
I tried, like,
ten different openings.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.429
And then last night,
it just came

02:41.462 --> 02:43.397
in, like, a rush.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.532
XIOMARA:
Yay, yay, yay!

02:44.565 --> 02:46.300
Why are you so happy?

02:46.334 --> 02:47.901
Because you cracked your novel.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.404
And after last night,

02:50.438 --> 02:51.639
Rogelio finally
sees his mother

02:51.672 --> 02:53.941
for the master manipulator
she is.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.277
Ah, yes, last night.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.412
Dad...

03:12.726 --> 03:13.727
You don't.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.728
I do.

03:14.762 --> 03:15.963
Mom.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.731
Come.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.900
Let's check in on the master
 manipulator, shall we?

03:19.933 --> 03:22.903
* It's another beautiful day
to be Rogelio *

03:22.936 --> 03:25.439
* Wake up, Rogelio

03:25.473 --> 03:26.874
* The day awaits.

03:26.907 --> 03:30.478
And in honor
of the first day of shooting

03:30.511 --> 03:34.382
of Tiago A Través del Tiempo.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.584
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Wow, she is good.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.353
I know what you're
doing, Mother.
Huh?

03:39.387 --> 03:41.422
You're trying to seduce me
into forgiving you

03:41.455 --> 03:45.526
with a perfect blend of savory
and sweet breakfast items.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.829
But it will not work this time.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.398
Rogelio, I am simply
making you breakfast.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.600
It's what I always did

03:52.633 --> 03:55.703
before your professional
milestones, okay?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.938
So, when you say your line,

03:57.971 --> 04:00.441
show you them
your beautiful soul

04:00.474 --> 04:03.911
and your beautiful teeth.

04:03.944 --> 04:07.515
Chewel's Gum oozes with flavor.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.817
Enough.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.819
I know we made an amazing
and dynamic team.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.521
But that doesn't change the fact

04:13.554 --> 04:15.623
that you lied
just to get my sympathy.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.426
Well, that is right.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.461
I-I did.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.364
But that's because I knew
that when the truth came out,

04:23.397 --> 04:26.033
I wouldn't have it.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.369
I just want you to be happy.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.670
You and Dad both.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.805
Oh, and we were,
we were.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.974
That is what's making this

04:34.007 --> 04:36.644
so difficult.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.546
I knew that your father

04:38.579 --> 04:42.015
had his stuff on the side.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.618
But we were partners
in other ways.

04:44.652 --> 04:48.055
So why is he now trying to,
trying to change everything?

04:48.088 --> 04:50.824
Rogelio?

04:50.858 --> 04:54.362
Please... talk to him.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.896
Convince him

04:55.929 --> 04:58.532
that he doesn't have
to leave me.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.903
Yep, he definitely
 has to leave her.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.406
Wait, where's Mateo?

05:05.439 --> 05:06.740
He was playing right
here on the floor.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.509
Mateo!

05:08.542 --> 05:10.544
Mateo?
Mateo?

05:10.578 --> 05:11.979
Oh, my God, look!

05:12.012 --> 05:13.381
He's crawling!

05:13.414 --> 05:14.748
(all clamoring)

05:14.782 --> 05:16.884
Oh, my God, he's crawling!

05:16.917 --> 05:19.453
He's crawling!
Slow down, speed demon.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.822
(all clamoring)

05:24.758 --> 05:27.828
My computer!

05:27.861 --> 05:30.097
No, no, no, no!
 Please don't be dead!

05:30.130 --> 05:31.999
Please.
XIOMARA: Oh, my God. No, no.
 Try to turn it on.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.435
JANE:
 I am. Oh, my God.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.438
I can't believe this.
 This is the worst thing ever.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.841
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Well, maybe not ever.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.676
You'll recall Rafael
 was injected

05:42.710 --> 05:45.446
with a mysterious liquid
 by his mother.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.980
Or Mutter, as it were.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.649
Where is the
flash drive?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.651
What are you talking about?

05:50.684 --> 05:53.587
The flash drive you traded for
Mateo. Who did you give it to?

05:53.621 --> 05:56.390
I gave it to Rose.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.459
No, she doesn't
have it. Who does?

05:58.492 --> 06:01.729
I think we can all agree
 that that's worse than possibly

06:01.762 --> 06:04.832
breaking a computer.
 But in fairness to Jane,

06:04.865 --> 06:06.166
she didn't know any of that.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.936
And hardship
 isn't a competition.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.505
My mother...

06:11.539 --> 06:13.941
Yeah, we know. We know.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.178
Why'd you want to
talk to me alone?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.913
Because my mother
wanted the chip.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.715
The one we traded for Mateo.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.451
Do you even want to know
what's on the chip?

06:23.484 --> 06:25.519
No.
All of the faces

06:25.553 --> 06:27.187
Sin Rostro changed.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.459
But I gave that to Nadine
to give to Rose.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.760
My mother says
Rose doesn't have it.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.428
Oh, my God.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.564
Nadine must not have given it
 to her.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.599
That's why I wanted to talk
to you, away from your partner.

06:38.632 --> 06:42.470
'Cause we probably broke some
laws trying to get Mateo back.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.638
You didn't. I did.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.574
It should be noted
 that at this moment

06:46.607 --> 06:48.609
Michael knew
 he had to come clean.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.878
But that didn't make it
 any easier.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.447
What the hell, Cordero?
Jane's baby was taken.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.147
I had to get him back.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.883
This, it's...
I know.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.117
But the chip, that's what

06:57.150 --> 06:58.452
this is all about.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.720
Rose took Mateo to get it.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.189
Elena took Luisa
to get Rose to give it to her.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.624
But Rose doesn't have it

07:03.657 --> 07:06.560
because Nadine didn't give it
to her.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.495
So where is it?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.129
I don't know. Yet.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.564
But give me some
time, please.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.900
What-what are you...
what are you gonna do?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.502
Please...
Wait.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.504
Hold on. Just...

07:16.537 --> 07:18.205
(sighs)

07:18.238 --> 07:22.676
Yeah. I'm not sure
if we can recover the files.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.078
I'll ask you to keep in mind
 that, like hardship,

07:25.112 --> 07:27.080
the importance of files
 is relative.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.918
Please. If there is anything
you can do, it is so important.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.252
Th-These are important files?

07:32.285 --> 07:33.721
Well, in that case,

07:33.754 --> 07:36.156
then I'm gonna really try.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.858
Yeah, I guess
you get that a lot.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.227
It's all relative,
you know? Look,

07:40.260 --> 07:41.662
I'm gonna give it to you
straight.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.264
OJ, it's like napalm
for keyboards.

07:44.297 --> 07:48.068
But it's okay. It's okay.
L-Look, I-I've done this before.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.704
I'm gonna go in the back,
run some diagnostics.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.105
You wait right over there.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.074
Regardless of
what happens,

07:54.107 --> 07:56.710
I'm gonna set you up
with a sweet cloud service

07:56.744 --> 07:59.012
so that this never happens
to you again.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.514
Okay?

08:05.719 --> 08:08.722
Um, heavy flirt alert.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.724
What are you
talking about?

08:10.758 --> 08:13.293
The eye contact.
The hand on the arm.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.295
He wants to set up
your sweet cloud?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.298
Oh. I-I just... My head
is not there right now.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.167
I'm in a crisis.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.670
What?
Nothing. I just think

08:22.703 --> 08:24.805
that the real crisis
is that you've lost touch

08:24.838 --> 08:27.741
with the fact that you are
a 24-year-old mom

08:27.775 --> 08:29.643
and not a grandma.
Lina.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.145
I'm serious. When was the
last time you got any action?

08:33.681 --> 08:35.215
Virgin action, even.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.683
My birthday?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.318
When you kissed Michael?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.753
Maybe.

08:39.787 --> 08:40.888
That was six months ago!

08:40.921 --> 08:42.956
No wonder you couldn't see
the flirting.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.959
You need a reboot, lady.
You see how I used
the tech lingo there?

08:45.993 --> 08:47.628
Okay, listen, I just don't
really have time right now.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.097
I-I...
No. No. I refuse
to accept that.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.099
You could find a dozen
eligible randos on Cynder

08:52.132 --> 08:54.101
while you're sitting
on the toilet.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.937
Look, I'm-a show you.
Oh, God. As romantic
as that sounds,

08:56.970 --> 08:58.972
I want a... meet cute.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.112
If I'm gonna meet somebody,
I'm gonna do it

09:05.145 --> 09:06.847
the old-fashioned way.
It's 2016.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.183
OkCupid is
the old-fashioned way.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.184
That is so depressing.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.086
Ooh, he is coming back.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.088
Look natural.
Sexy natural.
What? How?

09:15.122 --> 09:17.224
Shoulders back. Hi.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.091
Uh,

09:18.125 --> 09:19.359
what happened?
Not the coolest sitch.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.961
But let me keep it

09:20.994 --> 09:22.596
a few more days and go deep.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.932
(sighs)

09:24.965 --> 09:28.602
But you have a hard copy,
right? O-Of your document?

09:28.636 --> 09:31.605
Yeah. I mean, I have, like,
a middle-of-the-night one,

09:31.639 --> 09:34.207
not with revisions, but...

09:35.809 --> 09:37.778
I threw it away.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.212
(panting)

09:42.249 --> 09:44.852
The garbage.
Where's the garbage?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.657
No.

09:56.229 --> 10:00.200
From the Marbella
Business Center.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.936
Oh, you are saving my life.
Thank you.

10:02.970 --> 10:06.740
It's been such a traumatic day.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.142
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Again, relative.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.410
I hear you.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.411
(exhales)

10:11.444 --> 10:15.382
Can we talk, actually?
Out here?

10:15.415 --> 10:18.786
And so Rafael downloaded
 the whole sordid story.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.989
The injection.
 The flash drive.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.692
The fact that his mother was
 an international crime lord.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.928
Oh.

10:27.961 --> 10:32.399
Yeah. So I thought I'd
just watch Mateo here today.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.334
Are you okay?
I am.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.736
I promise.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.237
Go write.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.272
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which, for the record,

10:39.306 --> 10:41.775
she was trying to do, when...

10:41.809 --> 10:42.810
Hi!

10:42.843 --> 10:44.444
Hey.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.780
I'm Brad.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.816
Oh, I look a little
different with stubble.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.250
Excuse me?

10:50.283 --> 10:51.785
I know. Way different.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.954
What you got there,
a mocha latte?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.189
Oh, no-- I, uh,
I'm actually working.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.325
Oh, am I early?
Early for...?

10:58.358 --> 11:00.160
Our date?
Our what now?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.129
You're the one who
suggested coming here.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.430
On Cynder?

11:03.463 --> 11:05.999
I'm not on Cynder.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.034
You're Jane.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.335
I am.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.704
Yes, you are.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.740
Oh, my God.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.442
These pictures.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.710
Wh...?

11:16.744 --> 11:18.812
And "rando"?

11:18.846 --> 11:21.081
I've never used
that word before in my life.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.786
Okay, I'm never telling you
where I'm at again.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.054
LINA:
Oh, stop.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.388
Did you have fun, at least?

11:28.421 --> 11:30.724
No. It was very awkward
and confusing.

11:30.758 --> 11:31.959
That's because
it wasn't a match.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.426
Otherwise, it would've been

11:33.460 --> 11:35.362
the most romantic story ever.
JANE: Okay.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.764
Send me the profile info,
I'm taking it down.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.031
Fine.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.067
I'm sorry. I love you.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.381
ROGELIO:
 And I realized

13:01.414 --> 13:03.083
he was right.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.018
So, I'm going to make my mother
my manager again.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.153
What?

13:06.186 --> 13:07.855
The Kris to my Kim.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.422
It makes total sense.
That's how we started out.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.991
Rogelio, that's a terrible idea.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.260
Why? She needs this.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.162
I mean, I know
you don't like my mother,

13:15.195 --> 13:17.364
but I was hoping you'd be
more supportive of her

13:17.397 --> 13:18.899
in her time of need.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.336
JANE:
Hey!

13:23.370 --> 13:25.973
Hi.
Hi, Mr. Sweetface.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.875
Oh, my goodness
can you get cuter?

13:27.908 --> 13:28.608
How was writing?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.844
Oh, it was, um...

13:30.878 --> 13:32.112
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Interesting dilemma.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.346
Do you tell your ex-boyfriend

13:33.380 --> 13:34.614
about an ambush blind date?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.383
Lina ambushed me
with a blind date.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.218
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I guess if you're Jane, you do.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.853
She what?
She set up
a fake profile

13:39.887 --> 13:42.522
and set up a date.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.191
That's crazy.
I know.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.561
Was it a match, or...?

13:48.595 --> 13:49.629
Stop. No.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.064
Okay.
No.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.000
Ooh. (sniffs)
Ooh, whoo!

13:53.033 --> 13:54.902
Who needs a diaper change, huh?

13:54.935 --> 13:57.037
Okay, we'll be right back.
Yes.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.305
Let's go.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.572
Yeah.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.876
Mommy's so proud of you.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.077
Yes, she is.
(fusses)

14:04.111 --> 14:05.345
(phone whooshes)

14:56.196 --> 14:58.198
(phone ringing)

15:01.068 --> 15:03.170
He...

15:03.203 --> 15:04.671
Petra...

15:04.704 --> 15:06.506
Wait, what?

15:06.539 --> 15:08.375
Stop, stop. I'll be right there.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.049
Yeah. Okay, I understand.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.951
Hey.
Hey, what's going on?

15:17.985 --> 15:19.419
The babies are fine.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.955
Uh, there was some bleeding.
I got scared.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.290
But they're...
they're okay?
Yes.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.557
The oxygen levels are solid

15:24.591 --> 15:26.193
and the babies look good.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.560
But she's gonna have
to stay on strict bed rest

15:27.594 --> 15:29.196
for the next
week at least.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.064
Of course,
of course.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.365
We'll get you a nurse.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.633
24/7.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.241
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Not okay?

15:41.274 --> 15:42.976
Jane's thesis.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.145
Okay, back to it.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.180
*

15:59.159 --> 16:00.193
(sighs)

16:08.568 --> 16:10.037
(computer chimes)

16:11.571 --> 16:13.206
Okay, take that profile down.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.108
Then it's back to work.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.184
42 messages?

16:24.217 --> 16:25.352
Whoa.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.154
Okay, let's at least read them.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.056
That's just common courtesy.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.725
I'm Zander. 32,
into Vin Diesel movies,

16:32.759 --> 16:35.095
Greek food, and hopefully you.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.164
Damn, your pictures are hot!

16:37.197 --> 16:39.066
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

16:40.467 --> 16:42.569
Colby here. 26.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.572
Me: smart, athletic,
successful, confident...

16:45.605 --> 16:46.806
humble.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.808
You: really big...

16:48.841 --> 16:50.510
brains.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.045
(laughs)
LOL!

16:52.079 --> 16:53.613
Yeah!

16:53.646 --> 16:55.182
Taylor.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.584
My sister has
a friend called Jane.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.619
She's a freak.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.123
(groans)

17:03.156 --> 17:04.691
(electronic ding)
 What's that?

17:04.723 --> 17:06.193
(electronic ding)
 A wink?

17:06.226 --> 17:07.493
What's a wink?

17:07.527 --> 17:08.795
(chuckles):
 Oh, wow.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.530
That's flattering.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.266
Let's swap out the picture--

17:13.300 --> 17:16.136
something
 a little more... Jane.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.137
Now, let's see what happens.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.141
(electronic ding)

17:23.143 --> 17:24.844
Hey. I'm Greg.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.813
29. Scientist.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.781
(laughs):
Yes, really a scientist.

17:28.815 --> 17:32.152
I love books,
live music and the beach.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.486
Hey, who's that cute kid?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.155
Reminds me of my nephew.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.724
*

17:37.757 --> 17:39.359
(tapping keyboard)

17:39.392 --> 17:43.062
And just like that,
 she found the flow.

17:44.264 --> 17:48.168
See? Never know
 when inspiration will strike.

17:56.209 --> 17:59.078
Wow! It looks like
 we're going on a date, people!

18:06.453 --> 18:08.155
It's 2016, Abuela.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.190
OkCupid is
the old-fashioned way.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.424
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Looks
 like someone had an about-face.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.560
And it's just
30 minutes.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.295
I won't even buy a muffin
if there's no spark.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.431
I became involved in this
coastal ecology project

18:18.465 --> 18:20.167
studying Leidyula,

18:20.200 --> 18:22.735
which is a kind of slug
native to Miami.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.237
(laughs):
Anyways,

18:24.271 --> 18:25.505
after I graduated,

18:25.538 --> 18:27.274
the conservancy hired me
full-time, and...

18:27.307 --> 18:29.309
and I've been in Miami
ever since.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.149
Uh, what?

18:36.183 --> 18:37.317
N-Nothing.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.252
I-I was just thinking
about how my son

18:39.286 --> 18:41.421
would get a kick out
of touching a slug.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.822
Oh, Mr. Sweetface?

18:42.855 --> 18:45.825
Yeah. You remembered
his nickname.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.927
(ringtone plays)
Yeah.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.762
Oh. One sec. It's work.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.564
Let me get rid of them.

18:58.205 --> 19:02.375
Look at Jane-- surprised
 by this happy turn of events.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.777
Also surprised...
I've been trying
to call you.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.180
This is a report I wrote
outlining all your violations.

19:07.214 --> 19:10.550
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't drive it over
to the chief right now.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.385
I mean... I can't think of any.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.721
Because you need me
to find Rose and Elena.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.390
Nobody knows this case
better than me, okay? Nobody.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.726
Fair point.
 Still, illegal.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.428
I want to know everything
that happened

19:21.461 --> 19:23.363
between you and
Nadine in Mexico.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.465
You leave nothing out.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.866
You'd meet at the beach?

19:26.899 --> 19:28.301
Right. Once a month.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.237
MICHAEL:
 Daylight. A tourist place.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.905
Did you hear anything?
(sighs):
Nothing.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.275
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Actually,
 I'm gonna overrule here.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.277
We'll take
 the snapshot version.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.613
(camera shutter clicking)

19:44.784 --> 19:46.486
SUSANNA:
 Stop, stop.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.388
You're going to fast.
I'm sorry.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.790
(sighs) Okay, so on
the day of the meet...

19:50.823 --> 19:52.559
She said she had
information.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.261
Rose is meeting an importer,

19:54.294 --> 19:56.496
and they always meet alone--
no guns, no guards.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.565
This is our chance
to take her.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.732
When's it happening?

19:59.766 --> 20:01.000
(ship's horn blows)
Tonight.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.369
What was...
(bottle shatters)

20:02.402 --> 20:04.304
Ow!
Sorry.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.306
Sorry. I'm on edge.
Yeah, no kidding.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.407
(groans)
You're bleeding.
Sit down.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.575
No, no, I'm fine,
I'm fine. It's fine.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.910
Sit down.
Let me stop the blood.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.280
I have a first aid kit
in the car.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.282
Question.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.350
Do you trust me?

20:17.384 --> 20:19.286
I don't know.
Oh, you have

20:19.319 --> 20:22.255
to trust me-- that's the only
way tonight's gonna work.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.291
If it doesn't...

20:24.324 --> 20:26.293
then it's on you.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.328
MICHAEL:
 And I didn't.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.965
(distorted gunshot)

20:33.833 --> 20:35.001
And it is.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.036
Her death is on me.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.639
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Damn. Nadine really got
 under his skin.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.308
So please...

20:41.341 --> 20:42.842
don't go to the chief.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.412
Not yet.
JANE:
 I just need more time.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.447
I've never had to ask
for an extension before.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.383
I just... can't seem
to get my rhythm back.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.451
Okay.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.819
A story.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.487
Hmm?
I have one.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.456
To put this in perspective.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.526
Ernest Hemingway's wife went
to visit him in Switzerland,

20:59.559 --> 21:01.794
and she took a big,
green briefcase

21:01.828 --> 21:03.763
of all of her
husband's manuscripts

21:03.796 --> 21:06.533
because there was a publisher
that was interested.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.536
At a train stop she got up
to get a glass of water,

21:09.569 --> 21:13.773
and when she went back to her
seat, the briefcase was gone.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.408
Well, then
what happened?

21:15.442 --> 21:16.909
Besides Hemingway
divorcing his wife.

21:16.943 --> 21:20.380
Then he wrote
 The Sun Also Rises.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.382
And the point
of the story

21:22.415 --> 21:25.084
is that he never would
have written that book

21:25.117 --> 21:27.086
if he spent his time
trying to recreate

21:27.119 --> 21:28.555
what he'd already lost.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.557
Yeah. I just keep thinking

21:30.590 --> 21:32.392
that what I had before
was so much better.

21:32.425 --> 21:35.428
So stop thinking about
your thesis for 24 hours.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.798
I'm serious, let it go.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.468
WOMAN:
 She fired me.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.336
No...
Your key card
and your bill.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.338
I have dealt with some
nightmare patients,

21:45.372 --> 21:47.006
but she's a real piece of work.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.478
What happened?

21:51.511 --> 21:53.112
She was annoying.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.648
Too cheerful.
That's the second
nurse you've fired.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.450
The agency won't
send another one.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.985
I don't need a nurse.
I can take care of myself.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.955
I'll call room service
if I'm hungry.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.724
And what happens
if there's an emergency?

22:04.757 --> 22:07.059
I'll call you...
or the concierge.

22:07.093 --> 22:10.096
You make everything twice as
difficult as it needs to be.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.932
Krishna, patch all my calls
through to Petra's suite.

22:12.965 --> 22:16.369
Yeah, I'm going to
be working from here.

22:16.403 --> 22:19.005
I'm not supposed to work at all
for the next 24 hours,

22:19.038 --> 22:21.007
so, you know,
it's perfect timing

22:21.040 --> 22:23.776
to actually hang out
with Slug Guy again.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.479
And thank you, Lina, you were
right about online dating.

22:26.513 --> 22:29.782
And thank you, Lina,
it's a fun diversion.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.784
What?
Well, that's weird.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.386
I can't find his profile;
he just disappeared.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.455
Oh no, honey.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.157
He blocked you.
What?!

22:38.190 --> 22:39.759
No.
Yeah.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.761
No, if he disappeared,
that's what happened.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.596
But he was feeling it.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.598
And he canceled his
lunch to hang out more.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.601
And then his friend called and
said that his... car broke down.

22:48.635 --> 22:50.937
Oh. No...

22:50.970 --> 22:52.171
LINA:
 Yep, I know what happened.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.706
One sec, it's work.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.642
Let me get
rid of 'em.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.181
I wasn't clingy.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.485
You, Greg, Mateo and the slug.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.720
Well, I do have a
kid to think about.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.556
Only if you're trying
to find his next dad.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.790
Are you?

23:10.823 --> 23:13.159
I mean, I don't know.
No.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.193
The answer is no, okay?

23:14.226 --> 23:15.828
You are 24, okay?

23:15.862 --> 23:18.965
You need to have fun,
let loose, kiss a rando.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.132
(grunts)
(gasps)

23:20.166 --> 23:22.034
Oh, you know what?

23:22.068 --> 23:23.570
We're going out tonight.

23:23.603 --> 23:24.804
Yeah.
(grunts rhythmically)

23:24.837 --> 23:26.506
(laughing): What?
No, I can't.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.574
Yes, you can.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.888
Okay, my apron is not
rigged to fly off.

23:41.921 --> 23:42.889
What's going on?

23:42.922 --> 23:44.491
Sorry.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.493
Your mother switched the aprons
out at the last minute.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.227
Oh.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Uh-oh.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.463
Looks like Kris is causing
 some trouble for Kim.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.567
So what's up?

23:54.601 --> 23:56.769
I'm hearing you hate
the ending of the script.

23:56.803 --> 23:57.837
What? No.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.105
That's what
your mom said.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.576
(gasps)
I'll be right back.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.478
Mother, Mother,
Mother.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.680
I see you've met
our new costar.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.682
We were very lucky
to steal Adriana

24:09.716 --> 24:11.818
from Bandido
 de tu Corazon.
Ooh.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.860
Although perhaps
I made a mistake.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.497
Uh, wh-what did you say to her?

24:24.531 --> 24:26.699
Nothing, I told her a little
lip wax would go a long way.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.134
(gasps)

24:28.167 --> 24:29.536
Ooh, diva.

24:29.569 --> 24:30.603
Adriana,
please wait.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.605
Wait. Sor...

24:32.639 --> 24:34.707
She comes on a little strong,
but she's well-intentioned.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.008
She's not gonna be
around, is she?

24:36.042 --> 24:38.010
Don't worry,
I'll talk to her.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.146
I'll take care of it.
I hope so.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.148
Or Tiago might have
to travel through time

24:42.181 --> 24:44.283
to find himself
a new costar.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.685
(gasps)

24:45.718 --> 24:47.654
Is that a new
"or else" look?

24:47.687 --> 24:50.657
Yes, I have recently
added it to my repertoire.

24:50.690 --> 24:51.858
Is it threatening?

24:51.891 --> 24:53.059
Extremely.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.094
Good.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.572
How was work?

25:05.605 --> 25:06.573
Fine.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.575
Perfect, in fact.

25:08.608 --> 25:09.976
(gasps)

25:10.009 --> 25:11.277
What happened to your neck?

25:11.310 --> 25:14.113
Oh. Nothing.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.683
You have a rash.
Might be the new
foundation they're using.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.751
You sure everything's okay?

25:18.785 --> 25:20.152
You seem tense.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.588
I would tell
you about it,

25:21.621 --> 25:22.989
but I know you're biased

25:23.022 --> 25:24.624
and have a bone to
pick with my mother,

25:24.657 --> 25:26.759
so I don't feel comfortable
sharing with you.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.094
Come on.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.796
I feel bad.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.197
I-I messed up.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.832
Tell me what's happening.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.801
She's driving
everyone crazy.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.203
I have to give Adriana
an extended close-up

25:37.236 --> 25:39.105
just to keep her
from quitting.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.784
Okay, so talk to your mom.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.185
Tell her to tone it down a bit.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.186
(Mateo fusses)

25:54.220 --> 25:56.689
Coming, Mateo.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.124
Where's Jane?

25:58.157 --> 25:59.258
She actually
went out.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.260
Like, to a bar.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.796
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which brings us here.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.932
Like, to a bar.
All right,
where are all these

26:05.965 --> 26:07.233
exciting prospects
I was promised?

26:07.266 --> 26:09.068
Have two more drinks, and
they'll start to appear.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.803
Let's take a shot then.
For efficiency.
Yeah.

26:10.837 --> 26:12.371
Oh, my God. Okay.
What?
Don't look now,

26:12.404 --> 26:14.340
but over your left shoulder is
the guy from the computer store.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.208
Oh.
Stop. Be subtle.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.610
Okay.
Mm.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.712
Hey, computer guy?
What?

26:19.746 --> 26:21.213
What are you doing?!
Come on.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.749
What are the odds?
He's here, you're here,

26:22.782 --> 26:24.216
and he's perfect
fling material.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.085
Dax, hi!

26:26.118 --> 26:28.721
We met at the computer store.
The orange juice.

26:28.755 --> 26:31.891
Orange juice.
Yes. That's right.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.626
How's my computer looking?

26:33.660 --> 26:36.128
Uh, am I wearing a lanyard
around my neck?

26:36.162 --> 26:38.397
(laughs)
No.
Actually, we're all

26:38.430 --> 26:41.167
gonna hit the skate park
in a few. You should come with.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.904
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yeah. No way she's going
 to a skate park.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.740
You want to stay low
on the board.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.776
Uh-huh.
And just feel it out.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.143
You're not that high
off the ground,

26:51.177 --> 26:53.279
so if you fall, no biggie.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.914
Ready?
Yup, I'm ready.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.315
You're sure?
Yeah.
Hop on.

26:56.348 --> 26:57.984
Okay.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.285
(laughs)

26:59.318 --> 27:02.288
Good. Good.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.123
You feeling it?

27:04.156 --> 27:05.758
Maybe a little?

27:05.792 --> 27:07.994
Great. Now, now,
you want to carve it out.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.662
I don't even know
what that means.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.030
Oh. Hold on. Okay.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.264
You're a natural!

27:12.298 --> 27:15.101
I am?
Slow down.
Slow down. No. Wait.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.169
RAFAEL:
 What now?

27:17.203 --> 27:18.370
More crackers, please.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.006
Without sesame seeds.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.407
Oh, and water.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.075
(sighs)

27:23.109 --> 27:24.911
Wow. Seriously?

27:24.944 --> 27:27.113
What?
With the attitude?

27:27.146 --> 27:29.048
Look, if you don't want
to be here, you can leave.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.117
I can't leave,
because you fired the nurses.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.919
I had to.
Had to?
What do you mean, you had to?

27:32.952 --> 27:34.787
I had to.
They kept smiling at me

27:34.821 --> 27:36.756
and saying "Don't worry.
You're gonna be fine."

27:36.789 --> 27:39.225
That's what they said the
last time, and it wasn't fine!

27:39.258 --> 27:41.127
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I should point out

27:41.160 --> 27:43.395
what's unspoken
 between them right now.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.266
I get it.

27:47.299 --> 27:50.269
I'll get you your water
and crackers, okay?

27:50.302 --> 27:53.873
Okay.

27:53.906 --> 27:57.710
All right.
We're all good.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.078
You know, I've never actually

27:59.111 --> 28:01.147
seen someone catch air
their first time up.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.349
I didn't mean
to go so high.

28:03.382 --> 28:07.019
Well, you can't let the fear of
falling keep you from flying.

28:07.053 --> 28:10.222
That is so true.

28:10.256 --> 28:13.392
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And I should point out, there's
 something unspoken here, too.

28:15.862 --> 28:19.198
(camera shutter clicks)

28:19.231 --> 28:22.468
Hmm.
Well, it's all good.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.236
Thanks, Doc.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.772
Now, wait.
You're shivering.

28:33.179 --> 28:36.415
(sighs softly)

28:51.931 --> 28:53.766
I didn't see that coming.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.968
Well, then you weren't
paying attention.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.271
I had fun tonight.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.973
Is it over?

29:01.007 --> 29:03.009
(laughter)

29:03.042 --> 29:07.079
Maybe we can continue
this on a weekend.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.547
Mm.
This Saturday?

29:08.580 --> 29:10.216
Oh, Saturday I can't.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.819
I'm going out of town
with my girlfriend.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.854
(grunts)
XIOMARA:
 You're kidding.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.257
JANE: But I mean, I'm
mostly mad at myself.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.491
I actually
started imagining

29:19.525 --> 29:21.493
weekends at the skate park,

29:21.527 --> 29:24.396
because... I don't know
how to do this.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.032
What?
Date with a kid.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.167
I mean, how often
do I bring him up,

29:28.200 --> 29:31.203
and in what context, because the
moment you do, it gets serious

29:31.237 --> 29:34.340
real quick, you know? What?

29:34.373 --> 29:36.208
You've always
been serious.

29:36.242 --> 29:37.944
I mean, you were gonna marry
your first-grade boyfriend.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.853
My point is,
you're a relationship person.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.288
Yeah. I am.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.925
You know, and the thought
of going through all this again.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.061
Trying to find the right person,

29:55.094 --> 29:57.563
going on so many
terrible dates.

29:57.596 --> 30:00.132
Till one isn't terrible...
And then what?

30:00.166 --> 30:03.202
I have to start over again
with someone? It just sounds

30:03.235 --> 30:06.205
so exhausting.
I just want to skip to the end.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.107
XIOMARA:
So maybe you're
not ready yet.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.541
Why force it?
(phone chimes)
Maybe you're right.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.878
You know, I have
Mateo and my thesis.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.513
I have enough going on
right now.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.283
I'm sorry. I got
to go see Rogelio. Apparently,

30:17.316 --> 30:19.218
his mom is driving him crazy.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.553
You had a shadow
across your face!

30:21.587 --> 30:24.390
I am going to talk to the
cinematographer. Again.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.225
Mom!

30:26.258 --> 30:28.494
(sucks air through teeth,
grunts)

30:33.265 --> 30:35.367
Deep breaths.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.636
You can handle it.
I can't.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.006
I'm gonna have
to fire my mother.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.341
Rogelio.
You think
I want to do this?

30:42.374 --> 30:43.943
But there's no other option.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.312
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which brings us here.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.247
Now.
I told them

30:48.280 --> 30:50.316
you don't
pop in peach.
It's actually

30:50.349 --> 30:54.186
more of a coral,
and I do look good in it.

30:54.220 --> 30:58.190
Mom, this is not working.

30:58.224 --> 31:01.127
I thought it was a good idea
to have you here,

31:01.160 --> 31:03.295
but you're just too...

31:03.329 --> 31:05.264
present.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.466
And opinionated.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.435
I don't understand.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.403
Isn't that why
you asked me here?

31:11.437 --> 31:13.239
For my opinions?

31:13.272 --> 31:14.573
No.

31:14.606 --> 31:17.409
I-I asked you here
because you were struggling.

31:17.443 --> 31:21.347
And I wanted you to have
 something to occupy your time.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.415
Oh. (chuckles)

31:23.449 --> 31:24.450
I'm so sorry.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.218
No, no. Say no more.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.220
I am a professional.

31:28.254 --> 31:29.956
I know

31:29.989 --> 31:31.557
how show business works.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.359
It's fine.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.394
It's fine.

31:37.696 --> 31:40.299
*

32:00.987 --> 32:04.090
Well... I remembered
a sentence.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.491
Just the one sentence.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.504
(sighs)

32:21.507 --> 32:23.509
Hmm?

32:31.517 --> 32:33.052
Abuela...

32:42.494 --> 32:45.431
I got it.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.466
And, you know...

32:47.499 --> 32:50.402
there are some older people
that Internet-date.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.538
I can always
sign you up.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.507
Are you kidding?

32:55.541 --> 32:58.377
With that dress you wore
at the baptism?

32:58.410 --> 32:59.978
(laughs)

33:00.779 --> 33:03.415
(footsteps approaching)

33:10.156 --> 33:11.757
You okay?

33:11.790 --> 33:14.460
Well, my son
just fired me.

33:14.493 --> 33:17.363
So... not great.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.398
Okay, look.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.568
So you know, I...
I made him do it.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.437
So blame me, okay?
Not him.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.439
You're lying
through your teeth.

33:27.473 --> 33:28.574
What?

33:28.607 --> 33:30.476
No, I'm not.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.211
Xiomara...

33:32.244 --> 33:34.513
I overheard you two.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.449
I'm gonna have
to fire my mother!

33:37.483 --> 33:39.451
ROGELIO (over earphones):
You think I want to do this?
Rogelio!

33:39.485 --> 33:41.420
But there's no other option.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.523
No. Absolutely no.

33:44.556 --> 33:47.193
You don't fire your mom.

33:48.694 --> 33:52.464
But I appreciate
the effort.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.067
(softly):
I'll be okay.

33:55.101 --> 33:57.436
I know you will be.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.539
And I know it's scary
starting over,

34:00.572 --> 34:02.474
but... we're here.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.676
Okay? All of us.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.649
(sighs heavily)

34:12.583 --> 34:15.353
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Also
 figuring out her next step...

34:20.592 --> 34:22.161
Okay.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.762
I'm putting in everything.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.297
Mm-hmm.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.674
Mm-hmm. Oh.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.879
Okay, so then the Web site

34:40.911 --> 34:43.581
takes all this information
and comes up with...

34:46.585 --> 34:48.353
(phone whooshes)

34:49.321 --> 34:50.322
A text.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.726
Even better.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.695
My computer.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.503
When suddenly,
 and I should say,

35:04.536 --> 35:06.605
quite without warning...

35:09.241 --> 35:12.211
*

35:12.244 --> 35:14.380
...there it was.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.682
The spark.

35:22.288 --> 35:24.690
*

35:32.664 --> 35:33.832
MAN:
Miss.

35:33.865 --> 35:34.933
Last stop.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.902
Got to get off.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.906
See, it's true what they say...

35:40.939 --> 35:44.243
or what I said earlier.

35:44.276 --> 35:47.613
You never know when
 inspiration's going to strike.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.281
(distorted gunshot)

35:49.315 --> 35:51.550
(sighs)

35:51.583 --> 35:52.684
(ship's horn blows,
bottle shatters)
What was...

35:52.718 --> 35:53.685
Ow!

35:53.719 --> 35:55.287
NADINE:
 Oh, you have

35:55.321 --> 35:56.588
to trust me--
that's the only way

35:56.622 --> 35:58.290
tonight's gonna work.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.392
If it doesn't...

36:00.426 --> 36:02.428
then it's on you.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.564
You have to trust me--
 that's the only way

36:05.597 --> 36:06.832
tonight's gonna work.

36:06.865 --> 36:07.966
If it doesn't...

36:07.999 --> 36:10.202
(ship's horn blows)
What was...

36:10.236 --> 36:11.470
Ow!

36:11.503 --> 36:13.672
...then it's on you.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.275
...it's on you.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.848
(takes deep breath)

36:22.881 --> 36:24.383
(exhales)

36:24.416 --> 36:25.717
(inhales)

36:31.690 --> 36:35.327
(groans, pants)

36:35.361 --> 36:36.928
(takes deep breath)

36:38.730 --> 36:40.899
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Like I said,

36:40.932 --> 36:43.302
Nadine really got
 under his skin.

36:48.774 --> 36:49.775
Hey.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.411
(gasps)

36:53.679 --> 36:54.980
XIOMARA:
Hey.

36:55.013 --> 36:57.549
Your computer.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.585
(relieved sigh)
They got all the files back.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.752
Thank you.

37:00.786 --> 37:01.820
And guess who else is back?

37:01.853 --> 37:04.556
Oh. Glad you came, Liliana.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.758
Well, of course
I came.

37:06.792 --> 37:10.962
I am the one who suggested that
this last scene be rewritten.

37:10.996 --> 37:13.265
I want to see the results.

37:13.299 --> 37:15.301
*

37:18.770 --> 37:19.971
Manuel.

37:40.526 --> 37:42.994
And speaking of pride...

37:43.028 --> 37:44.963
DIRECTOR:
And action!

37:44.996 --> 37:47.466
*

37:47.499 --> 37:49.701
Disculpe.

38:01.813 --> 38:04.082
(all shouting)

38:04.115 --> 38:06.952
(siren wailing)
(voice-over):
 La policia!

38:06.985 --> 38:10.288
It was on me,
literally.
ARMSTRONG: What is that?

38:12.057 --> 38:13.325
MICHAEL:
A computer chip.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.060
Nadine left it with me,

38:15.093 --> 38:17.896
and I-I didn't know I had it.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.967
LILIANA:
 Honestly,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.736
I don't know what
I am going to do next.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.538
But I'll figure
something out.

38:26.572 --> 38:30.075
(chuckles):
I am... resilient,
if nothing else.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.710
I know you are.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.779
And, uh...

38:33.812 --> 38:36.448
I want to give you this.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.984
Since I no longer need it.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.753
For Xiomara.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.121
You know...

38:43.154 --> 38:44.923
you found a good woman.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.925
I think you
should marry her.

38:46.958 --> 38:50.396
Now, go back
to your telenovela.

38:50.429 --> 38:53.465
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And we should return to ours.

38:53.499 --> 38:56.034
*

39:01.106 --> 39:03.108
(chuckles)
"Natasha"?

39:03.141 --> 39:04.810
It's a good name.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.745
Like Boris and Natasha?

39:06.778 --> 39:09.415
Fine. Throw it out. Next.

39:15.086 --> 39:17.155
Oh, I like that.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.391
This was at the top
of my list.

39:19.425 --> 39:21.092
Show me.

39:25.897 --> 39:26.898
Yes.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.667
(whispers):
Oh, I love this.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.669
Let's see them together.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.438
*

39:32.471 --> 39:34.440
I like that.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.942
Wow, it's starting
to feel real.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.977
*

39:52.123 --> 39:54.793
My mother's a monster.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.596
But you're not.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.408
(keyboard clacking)

40:14.580 --> 40:16.548
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I know what you're thinking.

40:16.582 --> 40:19.017
Who's Pablo Alonso Segura?

40:24.590 --> 40:25.991
JANE: I wanted the love story
 to start right there.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.727
Completely unexpected but
inevitable at the same time.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.762
I love it.
Yeah?

40:30.796 --> 40:32.163
Yeah, there's no
wonder you went crazy

40:32.197 --> 40:33.899
looking for your
chapter; it's great.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.902
Well, no, I actually
wrote that on the bus.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.904
It's a lot better
than what I had before.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.906
Uh, I'm gonna be sure
and tell my nephew that

40:40.939 --> 40:42.541
next time he cries

40:42.574 --> 40:44.009
because his little brother
crushed his tower.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.944
Oh, how old are your nephews?

40:45.977 --> 40:47.946
Three and five.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.782
Man, I can't get enough
of those little guys.

40:50.816 --> 40:51.817
(chuckles)

40:53.985 --> 40:55.220
Uh, have you read this?

40:56.855 --> 40:58.924
That is one
of my favorite books.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.025
Me too.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.159
Read it every year.

41:02.594 --> 41:03.962
(chuckles)

41:03.995 --> 41:06.732
I was going to recommend it
for the magical realism.

41:06.765 --> 41:09.267
Hmm.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.237
Is that a grilled
cheese sandwich?

41:26.251 --> 41:28.987
Your brains are so hot.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.022
*

41:45.103 --> 41:47.005
(gasps)

41:47.038 --> 41:48.840
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Wow, okay.

41:48.874 --> 41:51.677
So, yeah, that was
 pretty inspired.
