34:47.931 --> 34:49.580
thank you, man. Jesus.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.683
If that's the way you feel, why the
fuck did you even come down here?

34:51.703 --> 34:53.033
You want to know why? Because Gus

34:53.074 --> 34:55.380
said he wouldn't come unless
I came. I'm sorry, Gus.

34:55.402 --> 34:57.569
I didn't want to be the reason
that he didn't get a vacation.

34:57.603 --> 34:59.449
No, don't turn this shit around on me, bro.

34:59.471 --> 35:00.365
You didn't want to come either?

35:00.407 --> 35:03.562
I wasn't sure if I was
gonna be able to come.

35:04.995 --> 35:06.483
The man just willed us his villa.

35:06.533 --> 35:07.487
If you believe that, you're a moron.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.054
Maybe he just got overexcited

35:09.095 --> 35:10.372
because we're all here.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.815
We're going home.

35:21.028 --> 35:23.539
So if you could... if you
could call us a ride...

35:27.284 --> 35:29.037
You all want to go?

35:29.655 --> 35:31.070
If you do, that's fine.

35:31.165 --> 35:33.677
It's just that Joel has a habit
of speaking for all of you.

35:34.246 --> 35:36.325
- He can't help it. It's his inner-teacher.
- Naw...

35:37.835 --> 35:39.463
we all want to split.

35:39.580 --> 35:40.646
All right,

35:40.762 --> 35:42.950
the flight's at 11:00.
I'll make sure you're on it.

35:43.304 --> 35:45.218
Can I make a suggestion, though?

35:45.314 --> 35:46.674
Stay for dinner?

35:46.944 --> 35:48.763
Let me explain today.

35:50.536 --> 35:52.212
Your ride will come in time

35:52.309 --> 35:54.450
to get you to your flight.

35:55.068 --> 35:56.566
Fair enough?

36:33.956 --> 36:35.360
All right.

36:38.450 --> 36:40.275
I'm sorry.

36:40.975 --> 36:42.701
I know I pissed you guys off,

36:43.685 --> 36:46.269
and if there's any way
I can make it right...

36:50.431 --> 36:52.134
- I guess I misjudged...
- Us,

36:52.624 --> 36:54.242
yes.

36:54.819 --> 36:56.641
You know, that's not really
what I was about to say,

36:56.667 --> 36:58.889
but thank you for interrupting me, Joel.

36:59.004 --> 37:00.922
[Soft slurping]

37:03.422 --> 37:05.625
- You sure you want all that?
- Mm-hmm.

37:06.015 --> 37:09.108
Yes, I am, but thank you, mom.

37:11.985 --> 37:13.351
Can I

37:13.465 --> 37:16.325
- speak honestly to you all about something?
- I doubt it.

37:16.440 --> 37:19.053
- Would you just fuck right off?
- Joel... Milo,

37:19.053 --> 37:20.831
- just say what you were gonna
say. I mean, no, forget it.

37:21.094 --> 37:24.163
Wait for your cab, and
then go home, would you?

37:38.103 --> 37:40.345
When you gonna get out there again, huh?

37:40.564 --> 37:41.938
Out where?

37:42.312 --> 37:43.319
Dating.

37:43.356 --> 37:45.341
Oh. [Laughs]

37:45.743 --> 37:47.661
I hadn't really given
that a lot of thought.

37:48.938 --> 37:50.761
Hey, remember that French chick

37:50.771 --> 37:52.538
you used to see before Lindsay? Um...

37:52.653 --> 37:54.022
Uh, Kehme.

37:54.136 --> 37:56.003
She was batshit crazy.

37:56.101 --> 37:57.602
[Laughter]

37:57.698 --> 38:00.654
- Mind you, they're the best in bed.
- The French?

38:00.672 --> 38:02.413
- The lunatics.
- [Laughter]

38:02.528 --> 38:04.753
Can't beat low self-esteem in the sack.

38:05.723 --> 38:07.418
They're up for anything.

38:08.760 --> 38:12.279
Your Kayla was probably
like that, wasn't she, Lex?

38:15.488 --> 38:18.263
- Why would you say that?
- 'Cause she tried to cut her wrists.

38:18.272 --> 38:20.555
- Can't get lower self-esteem than that. What?
- That's off limits.

38:20.588 --> 38:22.127
No. If you're gonna do it, you do it.

38:22.144 --> 38:24.603
- Could you not talk about that, please?
- For, like, the next 45 minutes?

38:24.718 --> 38:26.444
What else should we talk about?

38:33.144 --> 38:35.467
How about how Joel is
still in love with Helena?

38:35.476 --> 38:36.944
Why do you keep bringing her up?

38:36.981 --> 38:38.050
I don't need to listen to this,

38:38.058 --> 38:40.053
and thank you for including me,

38:40.169 --> 38:41.505
but I don't want any part of your villa.

38:41.542 --> 38:42.503
- You don't want it?
- No.

38:42.530 --> 38:44.307
No. Of course you don't. You know why?

38:44.307 --> 38:45.759
Because you always thought
you were better than me,

38:45.810 --> 38:47.472
more deserving, and for the life of you,

38:47.567 --> 38:50.162
you cannot figure out why I have all this,

38:50.183 --> 38:52.336
and you got... What?

38:52.362 --> 38:54.623
How ironic that the
person who has everything

38:54.644 --> 38:58.326
- is so desperately unhappy.
- You are so ecstatic.

38:58.341 --> 39:00.565
You have five fucking bedrooms,
but you still can't sleep.

39:00.579 --> 39:01.825
"I want my Helena back"?

39:01.853 --> 39:05.290
Why don't you go back to
your midwestern duplex, Joel,

39:05.319 --> 39:07.349
and mark off the days
until you got the balls

39:07.363 --> 39:10.144
to take the overdose.
And, Cobi, what are you?

39:10.160 --> 39:11.856
You're like some puffed-up,
low-level accountant?

39:11.897 --> 39:14.793
[Slams] I'm a financial consultant.

39:14.997 --> 39:16.541
Jesus Christ, Milo, you know,

39:16.557 --> 39:19.429
you've been on my case
since I fucking got here!

39:20.133 --> 39:22.388
Just... you know what? Just spew it out,

39:22.503 --> 39:24.825
because you clearly got a bug
up your ass about something.

39:24.861 --> 39:27.183
You think you are this
big fish in a small pond...

39:27.209 --> 39:29.013
- Okay.
- And that is what you are...

39:29.055 --> 39:30.505
- you are pond life.
- Whatever, fine.

39:30.620 --> 39:33.187
Lexi, I love you, bro, but you are a loser,

39:33.283 --> 39:35.725
and what pisses me off
more than anything else

39:35.776 --> 39:37.533
is how comfortable you are with that,

39:37.629 --> 39:41.130
so you go back to whoever's
couch it is you're crashing on

39:41.144 --> 39:43.479
or weekend drum circle, and, Gus...

39:43.514 --> 39:45.747
- I've been waiting for this all day.
- You are a fraud.

39:45.863 --> 39:49.121
You are living this
gigantic lie in your suit

39:49.236 --> 39:52.167
with your fucking fountain
pen, and you lie to us,

39:52.282 --> 39:54.463
and what's worse is you lie
to yourself, and about what?

39:54.477 --> 39:57.000
Because you can't face the
fact that you fucked up?

39:57.017 --> 39:59.113
That you had it all? You lost it.

40:01.862 --> 40:03.565
You made your choices.

40:06.562 --> 40:07.968
I made mine.

40:11.525 --> 40:13.029
Now, get the fuck out of my house.

40:20.723 --> 40:22.568
A cat just walked in.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.779
[Accented man] Where is the boat?

40:34.273 --> 40:37.030
I have no idea what you're talking about.

40:37.125 --> 40:38.726
[Gunshot]

41:31.326 --> 41:33.042
Open your mouth.

42:05.433 --> 42:08.474
[Whimpering]

42:36.070 --> 42:38.272
Don't bother with the police.

42:38.369 --> 42:40.289
We are the police.

42:42.864 --> 42:44.798
24 hour.

42:45.410 --> 42:47.003
Bring us that boat...

42:49.475 --> 42:50.907
Or...

42:51.498 --> 42:52.768
Puhh!

43:42.096 --> 43:43.648
Milo.

43:45.839 --> 43:47.278
He's dead, Joel.

43:47.394 --> 43:48.949
You can't die on us.

43:48.986 --> 43:51.014
Half his head came apart.

44:34.546 --> 44:37.512
- Where's the... we got to call the police.
- He is the police.

44:37.795 --> 44:39.915
The police don't go
around in fucking cat masks

44:40.031 --> 44:42.245
- shooting people!
- He left in a police boat!

44:42.281 --> 44:44.339
- We'll go to the embassy and explain.
- No, you don't get it.

44:44.379 --> 44:46.055
He blew Milo's head off

44:46.171 --> 44:47.693
because we took the boat.

44:47.711 --> 44:49.907
They'll have a 24-hour
emergency line or someth...

44:50.917 --> 44:52.513
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

44:52.629 --> 44:53.921
- Ow. Ow.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

44:54.020 --> 44:56.670
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

45:05.211 --> 45:07.950
Uh, what do you think their 911 is?

45:09.507 --> 45:11.415
- I'll try 911.
- Put the down the phone!

45:11.474 --> 45:13.248
Motherfucker took my DNA.

45:13.294 --> 45:15.831
He can use that to place
the black guy from Chicago

45:15.860 --> 45:17.103
in any crime scene he wants,

45:17.220 --> 45:19.114
so you can't call the police, Joel.

45:19.172 --> 45:21.788
- There'll be an investigation.
- We want an investigation!

45:21.832 --> 45:23.882
By a third world police force?

45:24.268 --> 45:26.153
Milo just left us this villa, man,

45:26.177 --> 45:27.439
his four broke-ass friends.

45:27.445 --> 45:29.013
We turn up, and then this?

45:33.218 --> 45:35.009
I'm being framed for murder.

45:35.038 --> 45:36.108
- By who?
- I don't know!

45:36.108 --> 45:38.397
- Let's go. Let's just go.
- If we run,

45:38.513 --> 45:39.971
they will track us down.

45:39.981 --> 45:42.146
- The cat?
- Yes, Lex, the cat,

45:42.156 --> 45:44.394
who may or may not be the fucking police.

45:44.430 --> 45:45.941
Does Belize have an extradition...

45:45.948 --> 45:47.722
You would know that.
You were a lawyer. You...

45:47.757 --> 45:49.437
Corporate. I did tax fraud.

45:49.461 --> 45:51.164
Well, maybe that'd come up in your class?

45:51.179 --> 45:53.295
Maybe it did! How the fuck would I know?

45:53.346 --> 45:54.729
- Then Google it!
- If you do that,

45:54.758 --> 45:57.144
there will be an online record of us

45:57.260 --> 46:00.637
searching for extradition,
which makes us more guilty!

46:00.677 --> 46:01.335
Listen.

46:02.516 --> 46:04.971
He would have killed us
if he wanted to, right?

46:05.899 --> 46:07.890
He just wants his boat back,

46:09.526 --> 46:10.991
so that's what we do.

46:13.112 --> 46:14.737
We get rid of the body

46:15.348 --> 46:16.826
in case somebody shows up.

46:18.094 --> 46:19.815
We clean this place up,

46:20.961 --> 46:23.982
and then we bring the
boat back to the marina.

46:27.409 --> 46:28.623
Then we get the...

46:29.480 --> 46:31.118
Fuck out of here.

46:32.294 --> 46:33.462
We go home,

46:33.774 --> 46:35.176
get on with our lives.

46:37.537 --> 46:39.253
We don't have to

46:39.455 --> 46:42.466
see each other or talk
about this ever again.

46:51.181 --> 46:53.182
Ugh.

47:41.437 --> 47:42.826
[Splash]

47:43.029 --> 47:44.274
[Clank]

48:06.200 --> 48:08.273
[Sobbing]

48:41.706 --> 48:43.046
[Sighs]

48:52.734 --> 48:54.130
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:57.132 --> 48:59.642
Uh, is Mr. Milo at home?

49:00.286 --> 49:01.930
Uh, no. He's away.

49:02.032 --> 49:04.609
- Oh, I didn't know.
- Yeah, he's not here.

49:05.564 --> 49:07.818
We're house-sitting, so...

49:08.746 --> 49:11.742
- Ay! You hurt your arm.
- Oh, right, it  was

49:11.846 --> 49:13.296
too many beers.

49:13.504 --> 49:15.221
Or maybe you were fighting?

49:15.443 --> 49:17.847
American men, you love to fight, no?

49:22.757 --> 49:25.785
So, right, you don't need to clean today,

49:25.802 --> 49:28.580
'cause we had a party last night, and

49:28.699 --> 49:32.452
so we already cleaned
up. It's... it's clean.

49:33.035 --> 49:35.525
- Why?
- We didn't think it would be nice

49:35.622 --> 49:36.703
to leave you with a big mess.

49:36.730 --> 49:38.829
Oh, no, I mean, why did you have a party?

49:40.192 --> 49:40.768
Oh...

49:40.809 --> 49:42.336
- It was my birthday.
- We're having a reunion.

49:42.924 --> 49:44.623
- Well, it was his birthday.
- And a reunion.

49:44.720 --> 49:45.641
Both.

49:47.067 --> 49:47.847
Ah.

49:48.803 --> 49:50.254
So why don't you just...

49:50.317 --> 49:52.399
you can take the day off. I mean, it's...

49:52.418 --> 49:53.602
[Woman giggles]

49:54.179 --> 49:56.355
Actually, I'm not your housekeeper.

49:59.578 --> 50:01.008
We're looking for a boat

50:01.494 --> 50:02.599
that has been stolen,

50:02.615 --> 50:06.013
and we thought maybe Mr. Milo
could help with our investigation.

50:06.438 --> 50:07.326
He's where?

50:08.238 --> 50:09.465
Guatemala.

50:09.564 --> 50:11.276
He's, um, showing a property.

50:11.332 --> 50:12.392
He'll be back...

50:12.862 --> 50:14.592
Uh, what is it... the day after tomorrow.

50:15.149 --> 50:16.242
Oh, okay.

50:16.521 --> 50:17.682
I'll come back then.

50:19.320 --> 50:21.317
Excuse me, um,

50:21.475 --> 50:24.327
why would Milo know
anything about a stolen boat?

50:24.577 --> 50:26.004
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't.

50:26.165 --> 50:27.853
Whoever took it must be crazy.

50:27.970 --> 50:29.859
It belongs to a man named Jesus.

50:29.876 --> 50:32.217
He's very dangerous, a psychopath.

50:32.674 --> 50:33.876
When people cross him,

50:33.899 --> 50:35.396
he cuts off their hands and their feet,

50:35.784 --> 50:36.698
so

50:37.425 --> 50:38.705
I'm sure it will appear.

50:41.744 --> 50:43.501
Okay, bye.

50:59.881 --> 51:01.939
I'm getting out of here.

51:02.068 --> 51:04.399
Jesus fucking Christ!

51:04.514 --> 51:06.175
- Lex, I need some pants.
- What?

51:06.193 --> 51:07.500
I burned my suit. I need some pants.

51:07.548 --> 51:09.139
- I burned my pants.
- Wait.

51:09.252 --> 51:10.652
I'm getting back to
Chicago if I've got to walk

51:10.671 --> 51:12.290
- through fucking Mexico!
- Stop. Wait.

51:12.323 --> 51:13.550
Joel, I can't get on a plane without pants.

51:13.572 --> 51:15.015
- I left my camera on the boat.
- You got any cash?

51:15.057 --> 51:16.682
The camera, I left it on the boat!

51:16.714 --> 51:18.476
All right, who gives a
shit? You can have mine then.

51:18.486 --> 51:19.996
I filmed us!

51:23.623 --> 51:26.646
It shows us calling each other by name
