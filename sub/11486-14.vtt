00:01.960 --> 00:03.598
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi, Uncle Charlie.

00:03.760 --> 00:06.558
- Ready for a fun weekend?
- He's not gonna have a fun weekend.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.359
Charlie, he's gonna study
for a history test on Monday.

00:09.680 --> 00:13.116
Well, if believing that gets you back
in your car, I'll play along.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.832
- Where's Alan?
- He's not here.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.718
Really? I told him I was on my way.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.757
That might be why he's not here.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.354
Okay, I'll just have to go
over everything with you.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.999
I'm gonna visit my parents.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.436
I won't pick Jake up till Wednesday.
Alan has to take him to school.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.874
Monday is soccer practice.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.759
He has his math tutor
and his guitar teacher on Tuesday...

00:31.920 --> 00:32.989
Hang on. Hang on.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.757
Oh, hi, Judith.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.070
Alan, why are you avoiding me?

00:47.240 --> 00:51.711
- I'm not avoiding you as much as...
- Hiding.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.516
- Thank you.
- Why were you hiding?

00:54.680 --> 00:58.116
Why does the wounded gazelle
hide from the stealthy jaguar?

00:59.600 --> 01:02.398
Why does the helpless piglet
hide from ravenous wolverine?

01:04.920 --> 01:06.114
<i>Animal Planet.</i>

01:07.480 --> 01:09.516
You learn a lot.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.355
We need to talk
about your pain-in-the-ass mother.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.873
You know, I would love to...

01:14.040 --> 01:17.669
...but as Charlie told you, I'm not here.
- I let her take Jake out to dinner.

01:17.840 --> 01:21.549
She brought him home and she lectured
me for 15 minutes about his dirty ears.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.712
- Fifteen minutes, huh?
- How long is this gonna take?

01:24.880 --> 01:26.108
Like I'm a bad parent.

01:26.280 --> 01:29.272
Let her try and get a Q-Tip
in a squirming 11 -year-old boy's ear.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.591
Mom didn't believe in Q-Tips.
She had a squirt gun.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.354
You know, the woolly meerkat
of western Africa...

01:35.520 --> 01:38.637
...buries her cubs up to their necks
and licks their ears clean.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.111
What? It seemed apropos.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.748
If she wants to spend time
with her grandson...

01:44.920 --> 01:47.150
...she needs to back off.
- Okay, I'll tell her.

01:47.320 --> 01:50.232
- Thank you.
- I'll tell Alan you stopped by.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.349
Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what?

02:02.520 --> 02:05.034
- I don't remember.
- You just read that chapter.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.271
Yeah, but Lewis and Clark
was a long time ago.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.989
Thanks for the ride, Sally.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.597
And for getting me home too.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.957
- Why is that funny?
- It's not.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.112
Mustang Sally, giddyup.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.471
Now, Lewis and Clark.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.756
Face it, Dad,
I'm just not good at history.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.990
Really? What did you have
for lunch yesterday?

02:31.840 --> 02:34.957
A pizza square. Actually, two
pizza squares, a ice cream sandwich...

02:35.120 --> 02:37.918
...and a bag of Skittles.
- Okay, see, that's history.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.116
And a Ding Dong and a diet root beer.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.477
- Great.
- Wait. It wasn't a Ding Dong.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.358
- It was a Ho Ho.
- Got it.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.795
You know what I like?
Those big, pink things with coconut.

02:49.960 --> 02:53.669
- Snow Balls?
- Exactly. Can you still get those?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.638
Yeah, but not at the supermarket.
You have to go to 7-Eleven.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.756
Thank you.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.480
Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven?

03:02.760 --> 03:04.671
No, we are trying to study.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.398
All right, I'll hoof it.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.550
- Can I bring you back something?
- Ding Dong.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.597
Who's there?

03:11.760 --> 03:13.796
I'm trying to get him ready for his test.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.829
Sorry. Sorry. You go ahead.
I'll pretend I'm not here.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.599
Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what?

03:23.760 --> 03:25.079
Louisiana Purchase.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.158
- Right.
- I knew that.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.311
Yeah, but Uncle Charlie buzzed first.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.710
And I'm still buzzed.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.592
- Okay, give me another question.
- All right.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.558
Seward's Folly
is another name for?

03:41.720 --> 03:42.994
- Jake?
- Alaska.

03:43.160 --> 03:47.711
- Very good.
- Oh, I was gonna say Mrs. Seward.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.598
Okay, the score is 1 to 1.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.159
Now that you mention it...

03:53.320 --> 03:55.914
...an Eskimo Pie would go down
pretty good right now.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.398
Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven?

04:00.120 --> 04:01.553
No, next question:

04:01.720 --> 04:04.553
- The War of 1812...
- 1812.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.794
- No.
- 1813.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.674
Let me finish the question.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.400
The War of 1812 was fought
against whom?

04:13.560 --> 04:15.835
- The British.
- Very good, 2 to 1, Jake.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.197
- Yes.
- No fair. My buzzer's broken.

04:20.279 --> 04:23.477
- Next question.
- Let me try yours.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.957
See? His works.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.595
All right, contestants,
we are at the final round.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.079
The questions are worth more.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.959
- And the answers are harder.
- True.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.635
- Wait for a question.
- Okay.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.997
Here we go. Name three changes
in American life...

04:47.160 --> 04:49.230
...brought about
by the industrial revolution.

04:50.200 --> 04:55.354
Populations shift to cities, employment
moving from farms to factories, and...

04:56.720 --> 04:59.712
- Yes?
- Sorry, I hit it by mistake.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.911
- Settlement of the West.
- That's correct.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.196
- You are our new champion.
- Yes.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.635
Settlement of the West.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.315
- You see, Jake? You know this stuff.
- Yeah, I guess I do.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.711
- Trust me, you are gonna do great.
- Yeah, thanks, Dad.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.757
You're welcome.
Now go get ready for bed.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.754
- I'll be there in a minute to tuck you in.
- Okey-dokey.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.991
Oh, I gotta get a security camera.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.230
Where's your brother?
I wanna talk to him.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.039
- He's not here.
- Oh, really?

05:37.200 --> 05:40.112
No, he's actually not here.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.032
You know what his ex-wife
said to me?

05:42.200 --> 05:44.111
Mom, please go away.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.953
She never calls me "Mom,"
but that was the gist of it.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.708
I took Jake out to dinner...

05:48.880 --> 05:51.075
- You're pretending not to understand me.
- Right.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.708
And all I did was suggest to Judith...

05:53.880 --> 05:57.793
...that she might wanna pay a little more
attention to her son's ear hygiene.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.315
Not only was she completely
unappreciative...

06:00.480 --> 06:03.711
...but she had the nerve to denigrate
how I raised my sons.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.997
Yeah, because we turned out so well.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.914
Excuse me, but whatever
emotional issues you think you have...

06:11.080 --> 06:13.913
...I kept your ears spotless.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.116
I remember.
You used the same Super Soaker...

06:16.280 --> 06:18.430
...to keep us off the furniture.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.318
Ladies and gentlemen...

06:20.480 --> 06:25.873
...presenting noted scholar
and A-student, Jake Harper.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.599
- You got an A?
- I got an A.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.877
- All right. Way to go.
- Congratulations, Jake.

06:33.040 --> 06:37.636
- Thanks. It's my first A this year.
- Really? Well, it's none too soon then.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.950
- Mom, leave it alone.
- I'm not saying anything.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.032
I think it's wonderful.
Did anybody else in your class get an A?

06:43.200 --> 06:44.713
Almost everybody. Why?

06:44.880 --> 06:47.269
Oh, I was just curious
as to how hard the test was.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.158
It doesn't matter, Mom.
Still an A.

06:49.320 --> 06:52.676
An A is very nice. I just don't know
why you're making such a big fuss...

06:52.840 --> 06:56.116
...if they're just handing them out
like rubella vaccinations.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.669
I don't know.
It looks like a pretty hard test to me.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.875
- No, it was easy.
- That's because you studied.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.429
- You earned that A.
- Wendy Chow got an A-plus.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.750
You hear that?
Wendy Chow got an A-plus.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.309
Wendy Chow is a freak of nature.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.914
She cloned a goldfish
for the science fair.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.433
We can't compare Jake to her.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.990
Who should we compare him to then?
The paste eaters and the unibrows?

07:17.880 --> 07:20.838
Darling, if you set the bar
low in childhood...

07:21.000 --> 07:23.275
...he may never reach
the heights he's capable of.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.318
You're condemning him
to a life of failure and mediocrity.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.677
Is that what you want, Jake?
A life of failure and mediocrity?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.279
No.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.476
You see? He may well be sharper
than you give him credit for.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.992
I'm gonna go to my room.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.830
I am putting that A-paper
up on the fridge.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.310
Wow. Texas used to be
a separate country.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.677
Why did we change that?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.352
Not now, Charlie.
How dare you?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.434
- Excuse me?
- He worked hard on that test.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.637
He was finally feeling good
about himself and his abilities...

08:00.800 --> 08:02.711
...and in 30 seconds
you managed to suck...

08:02.880 --> 08:05.713
...every bit of self-esteem out of him.
You're like a...

08:05.880 --> 08:08.394
- A self-esteem sucker.
- Yes, exactly.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.954
Alan, I was just having
a conversation with the boy.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.634
No. No, you don't
have conversations. You...

08:14.800 --> 08:17.109
Suck self-esteem.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.196
I would've gotten it.

08:21.360 --> 08:25.956
Mom, I am sorry, but I don't think
I want you around my son anymore.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.596
- What?
- You heard me.

08:28.760 --> 08:29.875
You will not do to him...

08:30.040 --> 08:32.918
...what you did to me and Charlie.
- What did I do to you?

08:33.080 --> 08:36.311
What did you do? What did she...?
Charlie, tell her.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.957
Why tell her when we can show her?

08:45.960 --> 08:49.236
I see. So you're both
turning against me.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.233
Oh, I turned a long time ago.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.634
Alan's just catching up.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.670
All right, fine.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.400
If I'm not welcome here...

09:02.560 --> 09:03.834
...I'll leave.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.954
My own sons are throwing me out.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.352
Goodbye.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.471
This isn't over, is it?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.556
No, we're screwed.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.111
Let me guess. Mom?

09:32.280 --> 09:35.238
She's been calling all morning.
I'm starting to feel guilty.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.029
You can't show weakness, Alan.
She'll sense it.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.509
Like the hooded cobra senses
the rapid heartbeat...

09:41.680 --> 09:43.318
...of a panic-stricken kangaroo rat.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.596
But don't you feel
even a bit sorry for her?

09:47.760 --> 09:50.832
Does the mongoose feel sorry
for the wounded garden-snake?

09:52.320 --> 09:56.552
Does the dingo feel sorry
for the slow-crawling Australian baby?

09:58.760 --> 10:01.115
- You guys okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.918
We're fine. Why?

10:03.080 --> 10:06.311
Your mother just called me. She said
she's been trying to reach you...

10:06.480 --> 10:08.198
...all morning
and she's very worried.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.396
- We're fine, Rose.
- We're not talking to her.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.712
Why? Because she tried to encourage
Jake to live up to his potential?

10:14.880 --> 10:17.758
That's a reason to throw her out
and slam the door in her face?

10:19.200 --> 10:21.509
How could you be so cruel
to your own mother?

10:23.160 --> 10:26.789
And the dingo has found
another Australian baby.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.237
Rose, that's not what happened.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.719
We were protecting Jake.

10:31.880 --> 10:35.111
How? By ripping his only grandmother
out of his life?

10:35.280 --> 10:38.955
- He has another grandmother.
- Oh, right, the Sacramento pill-freak.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.230
Is that what she told you?

10:41.400 --> 10:43.311
For the record,
Jake's other grandmother...

10:43.480 --> 10:45.436
...is out of rehab and doing just fine.

10:46.840 --> 10:51.038
We appreciate your concern, Rose.
Thanks for stopping by.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.475
So now you're just gonna
slam the door in my face?

10:53.640 --> 10:55.392
Pretty much.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.429
Not as satisfying with a glass door.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.350
Okay, first she starts
with the phone calls...

11:03.520 --> 11:05.750
...then she sent Rose over.
I wonder what's next.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.480
I don't know, but I'm betting
it'll be something big.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.636
Right. I understand, it's terrible.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.837
Okay, let me see
what I can do about it.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.798
How in the hell did your mother
get my cell phone number?

11:27.280 --> 11:29.191
<i>Sometimes,</i>
<i>when the nest is threatened...</i>

11:29.360 --> 11:33.831
<i>... the seemingly docile creatures have</i>
<i>been known to eat their own young.</i>

11:34.000 --> 11:37.037
Hey, did Mom call you
at the office today?

11:37.200 --> 11:38.599
No, she call here?

11:38.760 --> 11:43.231
- No, it's been pretty quiet.
- Yeah, maybe too quiet.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.996
<i>And here we see</i>
<i>the female praying-mantis...</i>

11:46.160 --> 11:49.550
<i>... after copulation,</i>
<i>devouring her mate.</i>

11:49.720 --> 11:52.837
Your ex-wife back from her parents'?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.434
Yeah, I dropped Jake off
with her this afternoon.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.114
Apparently her mom had
a little relapse with the pills.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.077
- Oh, yeah?
- They found her in pajamas...

12:00.240 --> 12:04.358
...driving an imaginary car through the
home and garden section of Wal-Mart.

12:04.760 --> 12:07.320
How could they tell
if she was driving an imaginary car?

12:07.480 --> 12:10.552
She rolled down the window
to ask for directions to the pharmacy.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.638
- <i>Here we witness the...</i>
- Not Mom.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.117
Hello? Yeah, this is Charlie Harper.

12:22.280 --> 12:25.033
What? I see.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.952
Okay, then.
Thanks for letting me know.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.070
- Who was that?
- St. John's Hospital.

12:30.240 --> 12:33.994
Our mother checked in this evening with
chest pains and breathing difficulties.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.515
- Oh, my God.
- Ever wonder who was the first guy...

12:36.680 --> 12:39.035
...to put pineapple on pizza?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.030
I bet he was gay.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.670
- Charlie...
- No straight guy is gonna say:

12:46.840 --> 12:49.638
"You know what this pizza could use?
A pineapple ring."

12:51.560 --> 12:53.755
God bless him. It's good.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.353
Charlie, is Mom okay?

12:55.520 --> 12:57.351
Of course she's okay. She's faking.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.478
- How can you be so sure?
- It really doesn't make any difference.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.712
If she is faking and
we rush to see her, she wins.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.711
If she's not faking,
and we ignore her...

13:06.880 --> 13:09.189
...she complains
about what horrible sons we are...

13:09.360 --> 13:10.713
...and she still wins.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.440
What if she's not faking and she dies?

13:14.320 --> 13:16.914
Well, look at you, Mr. Glass Half-Full.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.351
I can't help thinking this is all my fault.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.717
I told Mom she couldn't see
her grandson and she had a heart attack.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.950
Alan, you forget
who you're dealing with.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.634
This woman buried two husbands
and divorced two others.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.836
She's lived through wars,
riots, earthquakes.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.993
Only way you're gonna bring her down
is with a stake dipped in holy water.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.072
Here we are.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.271
Oh, my God. Mommy?

13:45.440 --> 13:46.714
Excuse me?

13:46.880 --> 13:48.836
- Are you family?
- Yeah, we're her sons.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.389
Is she gonna be okay?
Tell me she's gonna be okay.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.632
Your mother's gonna be fine.
I can't find a thing wrong with her.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.518
- Are you sure?
- As sure as I can be.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.272
Her heart's fine. Lungs are fine.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.317
Blood chemistry's good. EEG's normal.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.472
- Oh, thank God.
- That bitch.

14:04.520 --> 14:05.919
Yeah, tell me about it.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.275
Excuse me.
I'm gonna tell her she can go home.

14:09.440 --> 14:12.512
- Oh, no, please, let us.
- Yeah, we owe her that.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.240
Suit yourself.
Oh, better hurry, though.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.834
The nurses are circulating
a"do not revive" petition.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.550
- You said there was nothing wrong.
- It's a big hospital.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.392
Things happen.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.359
What do we do now?

14:28.520 --> 14:31.512
Don't worry. I got a plan.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.318
Oh, great, he has a plan.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.474
Mom?

14:39.240 --> 14:41.913
Charlie? Is that you?

14:42.080 --> 14:43.718
Alan's here too, Mom.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.759
- Hi, Mom.
- Boys, you didn't have to come.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.318
Are you kidding? Of course we did.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.869
- Right, Alan?
- Of course.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.109
Tell us what happened.

14:55.280 --> 14:59.114
I came home this afternoon, alone.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.151
I was walking up the stairs...

15:03.640 --> 15:05.278
...alone.

15:07.120 --> 15:10.112
And I had trouble breathing...

15:10.880 --> 15:14.190
...so I drove myself to the hospital...

15:15.040 --> 15:16.314
...alone.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.472
- Well, why did you drive yourself?
- Oh, I didn't wanna bother...

15:22.640 --> 15:24.790
...the ambulance people.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.315
Why didn't you call us?

15:28.960 --> 15:34.592
Oh, you both made it very clear
how you feel about me.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.193
Now, that's not fair.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.954
Just tell Jake...

15:39.120 --> 15:42.237
...his Grandmommy loves him
very much.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.753
Don't talk like that.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.434
You can tell him yourself,
after the operation.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.953
What operation?

15:52.120 --> 15:55.317
Relax. Relax. Quadruple bypasses
are routine these days.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.038
- Quadruple?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.998
You got four clogged arteries.
Right, Alan?

16:00.160 --> 16:03.357
Right, the doctor said it's lucky
you came when you did.

16:03.520 --> 16:07.149
Another few days and you'd have been
flopping around on the floor like a carp.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.275
It's no big deal, Mom.
They crack open you open...

16:10.440 --> 16:13.432
...flush out the pipes, sew you back up
and you're good as new.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.558
Except, you know, for the big,
gnarly scar on your chest.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.278
They're prepping the OR.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.396
We got the best surgeon available.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.834
He's young but really sharp.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.752
And well-respected in his own country.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.118
Well, all right.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.989
If it has to be done, it has to be done.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.551
I love you, boys.

16:47.880 --> 16:51.077
If the worst should happen...

16:51.880 --> 16:53.757
...please remember that.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.594
- Yeah. Sure.
- Of course.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.951
Oh, my God, Evelyn
Are you all right?

17:00.120 --> 17:03.669
Oh, Judith, is that you?

17:04.200 --> 17:06.077
Yes, I'm right here. Jake's here too.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.913
Oh, Jake.
Come to Grandmommy, darling.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.637
I'm sorry you feel bad, Grandma.

17:10.800 --> 17:14.917
Oh, Grandmommy's feeling much better
now that her little man is here.

17:15.599 --> 17:20.151
- I made you a get-well card.
- Oh, isn't that nice.

17:20.319 --> 17:21.752
Gift shop wasn't open?

17:24.880 --> 17:28.190
You said you had a plan.
Well, guess what? It was a bad plan.

17:28.359 --> 17:30.430
- Alan, calm down.
- The plan sucked.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.554
- Don't worry.
- Don't worry?

17:32.720 --> 17:35.712
She's expecting a quadruple bypass.
What are we gonna do?

17:35.880 --> 17:37.552
We're gonna get her one.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.359
Must be someone around here
who can handle a rib spreader.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.272
- Charlie, that's insane.
- You're right.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.715
There's no time. Better scrub up.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.597
She had to drive herself to the hospital?
What is wrong with you two?

17:48.760 --> 17:51.320
- Relax, Judith. She's not sick.
- What?

17:51.480 --> 17:54.517
She's faking and we called her bluff,
and then she called ours.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.035
So now, we're gonna
have to cut her open.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.078
You want in?

17:59.800 --> 18:01.836
Hey, guess what?
After Grandma's operation...

18:02.000 --> 18:04.230
...she's gonna take me
to Magic Mountain, okay?

18:04.400 --> 18:07.198
Yeah, yeah, that's okay.
We're gonna have to tell her.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.191
You sure?
We don't need to do the bypass.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.191
All we do is put her out,
slice her open.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.352
- The scar will sell it.
- The truth, Charlie.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.111
Doesn't have to be a big scar.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.874
Okay, doctor, let's schedule
this as quickly as possible.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.554
Oh, great. I'll be here.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.517
Hello, boys.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.278
- What are you doing?
- Lf I'm going to have to have surgery...

18:30.440 --> 18:31.793
...I want my own doctor.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.269
Mom, you don't really need a surgeon.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.829
Oh, but I do.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.673
Your quadruple bypass story
makes the perfect cover...

18:39.840 --> 18:41.558
...for a little nip tuck.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.995
No turkey neck for Grandmommy, right?

18:45.440 --> 18:48.000
About Jake. I told him
I'd take him to Magic Mountain...

18:48.160 --> 18:50.549
...but you know
how I feel about direct sunlight.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.676
Yeah, and wolfbane.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.670
You'll take him for me,
won't you, Charlie?

18:56.840 --> 18:58.558
- Sure, Mom.
- I'll make it up to him...

18:58.720 --> 19:02.110
...by taking him out for a haircut
and some decent clothes.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.999
- He'll like that.
- Sure, Mom.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.549
Maybe when his mother sees
how nice he could look...

19:07.720 --> 19:11.030
...she'll take the hint and stop dressing
him like a tackling dummy.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.788
Oh, the food here is just dreadful.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.030
So why don't you boys
run across the street...

19:17.200 --> 19:18.679
...and get me a nice ahi tuna...

19:18.840 --> 19:20.796
Charlie, what in God's name
are you doing?

19:22.960 --> 19:24.791
Just practicing.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.076
<i>The worker bees, or drones...</i>

19:31.240 --> 19:34.550
<i>... live a life of utter devotion</i>
<i>to their queen.</i>

19:35.000 --> 19:37.230
You had a plan.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.797
<i>From birth, these industrious</i>
<i>yet mindless creatures...</i>

19:40.960 --> 19:43.428
<i>... slave away to fulfill</i>
<i>the queen 's every need.</i>

19:43.640 --> 19:46.996
"Don't worry, Alan. I have a plan."

19:48.360 --> 19:52.911
<i>Until finally they reach the end</i>
<i>of their brief lifespan and die...</i>

19:53.080 --> 19:56.072
<i>... becoming food and building materials</i>
<i>for the rest of the hive.</i>

19:56.240 --> 20:00.153
Alan, where's my sandwich?

20:00.920 --> 20:02.876
Coming, Mom.

20:03.880 --> 20:09.238
<i>A cruel existence? Perhaps.</i>
<i>But that's life on the</i> Animal Planet.
