00:02.102 --> 00:02.868
<i>Previously on Medium:</i>

00:02.936 --> 00:06.071
I don't know how to do it.

00:06.139 --> 00:08.740
I don't know
how to fire these people.

00:08.775 --> 00:11.877
I want to buy back my company
and my idea from you.

00:11.911 --> 00:13.612
The business is not for sale.

00:13.746 --> 00:15.848
Your idea is not for sale.

00:15.882 --> 00:18.183
You are not for sale.

00:18.251 --> 00:20.119
(phone rings)

00:20.153 --> 00:22.154
If you're still interested...

00:22.222 --> 00:25.257
I'll sell you back your company.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.059
If you can get together
a couple

00:27.093 --> 00:30.295
of million dollars, we can
figure out how you can pay me

00:30.363 --> 00:31.530
the balance over time.

00:31.564 --> 00:33.132
I'm Cynthia Keener.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.667
I'm an investigator
with Ameritips.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.704
I guess she's hoping
I'll be able to help her
with some of her cases.

00:38.738 --> 00:40.305
<i>According to this,
Cynthia Keener</i>

00:40.373 --> 00:43.876
<i>had a daughter named Suzie
who went missing in 1998.</i>

00:43.943 --> 00:45.577
I had nothing to do
with her death.

00:45.678 --> 00:47.913
If you think this is over,
you're wrong.

00:47.947 --> 00:51.383
<i>Suzie... it was my job
to stand up for her.</i>

00:51.451 --> 00:53.619
<i>And now I finally have.</i>

00:53.653 --> 00:57.222
It's all right, Allison.

00:57.290 --> 01:00.159
I've called
the authorities.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.727
They'll be here
in a moment.

01:07.033 --> 01:10.769
(bird cawing)

01:17.210 --> 01:20.712
CYNTHIA:
You should have
that looked at.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.414
Could leave a nasty scar.

01:22.449 --> 01:23.582
(bag thuds on ground)

01:23.616 --> 01:24.917
MAN:
You're late.

01:24.951 --> 01:26.819
I was about to leave.

01:26.886 --> 01:28.487
Oh, I'm not sure I believe that.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.456
I think you'd have waited
as long as you had to.

01:36.396 --> 01:39.097
It's all there. Unmarked bills,
just like you asked.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.899
No tricks.
No transmitters.

01:43.303 --> 01:45.637
Where's Bethany?

01:45.672 --> 01:47.906
Down there.

01:47.974 --> 01:49.942
(bird caws)

01:49.976 --> 01:52.978
Oh, my God.
What have you done?

01:53.012 --> 01:54.646
I buried her down there
an hour ago.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.148
Figure she has maybe...

01:56.182 --> 01:59.785
five or six minutes
of air left.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.367
Bethany! Can you hear me?

02:15.435 --> 02:16.435
(thumping)
Bethany!

02:16.469 --> 02:18.403
Bethany, I'm coming!

02:18.438 --> 02:20.372
(panting)

02:20.406 --> 02:22.007
Bethany!

02:22.075 --> 02:23.742
Can you hear me?!

02:23.777 --> 02:26.879
Can you hear me?
I'm coming!

02:26.946 --> 02:29.281
Bethany! Can you hear me?

What do you think?

03:21.801 --> 03:25.303
Professional or funereal?

03:25.338 --> 03:26.571
(chuckles)

03:26.639 --> 03:29.007
Definitely professional.

03:29.041 --> 03:31.543
Professional undertaker, maybe.

03:31.577 --> 03:33.712
(laughs)
You know what?

03:33.779 --> 03:36.615
You look like the kind of guy
I would sell a company to.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.350
Really? Well, that and
two million dollars

03:38.384 --> 03:39.951
will get me a company.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.621
Come on, you just need
more time to get the money.

03:42.688 --> 03:44.089
Terry will understand that.
Today's the deadline.

03:44.123 --> 03:46.324
I mean, it's not like I
have some of the money.

03:46.359 --> 03:47.759
I don't have any of the money.

03:47.793 --> 03:49.361
And the truth
is, even if I

03:49.428 --> 03:51.463
do get an extension
I don't know where

03:51.530 --> 03:53.398
I'm going to get
this money from.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.066
Which tie?

03:55.101 --> 03:56.968
Hey. (whistles)
Earth to Allison.

03:58.504 --> 04:02.007
Uh... no. N-No tie.
Neither one.

04:02.074 --> 04:03.008
Too much.

04:03.075 --> 04:04.809
That's why I married you.

04:04.877 --> 04:07.345
What are so taken with
on my computer there?

04:07.380 --> 04:10.015
I had a dream last night
about Cynthia Keener.

04:10.049 --> 04:12.951
A "woman in prison"
kind of dream?

04:13.019 --> 04:15.420
(laughs):
No.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.154
No, it was something
that took place a while ago,

04:17.189 --> 04:19.257
and I just found
this old newspaper article

04:19.325 --> 04:20.825
that makes it look like
it actually happened.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.460
Do you want to share?

04:22.528 --> 04:23.561
Do you really care?

04:23.596 --> 04:24.429
No.

04:24.463 --> 04:26.564
Fine, then ignore me.

04:26.632 --> 04:28.400
(typing)

04:32.138 --> 04:33.405
Hi. My name's Allison Dubois.

04:33.472 --> 04:35.173
This is actually the third time
that I've called.

04:35.241 --> 04:36.374
I'm trying to arrange a...

04:36.409 --> 04:38.209
a visit with a prisoner
that you have there.

04:38.244 --> 04:41.079
Her name's Cynthia Keener.

04:41.147 --> 04:43.248
Yeah, I am calling
from a city phone,

04:43.282 --> 04:45.317
but this is not
official business.

04:45.351 --> 04:46.618
You don't understand my wife!

04:46.686 --> 04:48.753
She checks in with me
three times a day;

04:48.821 --> 04:50.755
I haven't heard
from her!

04:50.823 --> 04:52.390
I'm a taxpayer!
I see...

04:52.425 --> 04:54.225
This is a crime!

04:56.662 --> 04:59.397
Look, all I know is,
my wife has been missing

04:59.432 --> 05:01.566
for 12 hours, and nobody
is doing a damn thing.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.034
Mr. Sipes?
Mr. Sipes, what?

05:03.102 --> 05:04.235
DEVALOS: It's standard
police procedure
Uh-huh...

05:04.270 --> 05:06.638
to wait 36 hours before
filing a missing...

05:06.706 --> 05:08.607
SIPES: Don't talk to
me about 36 hours!

05:08.674 --> 05:10.108
If I'd have backed
you in the election,

05:10.142 --> 05:11.743
I am sure that the
National Guard

05:11.777 --> 05:14.713
would be out there right
now looking for Amy.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.723
Okay. Um...

05:24.757 --> 05:26.858
I understand.
So, I'll just...

05:26.892 --> 05:28.293
I'll just wait for your call.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.995
Let me give you my cell number.

05:30.062 --> 05:30.996
(knock on door)

05:31.063 --> 05:32.063
Yeah, come in.

05:32.098 --> 05:34.566
(door opens)

05:34.634 --> 05:36.534
You okay?

05:36.602 --> 05:39.104
Oh... you mean that little scene
just now?

05:39.138 --> 05:41.339
I've been through worse.
Just not lately.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.508
Who was that man?

05:43.576 --> 05:45.910
I thought you knew.
That was Christopher Sipes.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.712
Why do I know that name?

05:47.780 --> 05:49.147
He's become a pretty big player

05:49.181 --> 05:51.149
in downtown Phoenix
real estate the last few years.

05:51.183 --> 05:52.717
Has his name
on a lot of buildings,

05:52.752 --> 05:54.486
or on the signs
in front of buildings.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.988
A real rags to riches story.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.557
Although making a lot of money
hasn't made him any nicer.

05:59.592 --> 06:00.692
Oh, and here's a shock.

06:00.726 --> 06:02.427
His wife disappeared,
or so he says.

06:02.461 --> 06:04.796
You think otherwise?

06:04.864 --> 06:06.164
(sighs)
You're right.

06:06.198 --> 06:08.033
Why would anyone leave
the charming Mr. Sipes

06:08.100 --> 06:10.101
and not tell him
where they're going?

06:10.169 --> 06:12.904
Nonetheless, I'm going
to ask Detective Scanlon

06:12.939 --> 06:14.372
to run her license plates,

06:14.407 --> 06:17.375
and check her credit cards,
do whatever we can

06:17.410 --> 06:19.544
until the police can launch
an official search.

06:19.578 --> 06:21.479
Is there anything
I can do?
Hmm...

06:21.514 --> 06:24.649
(ringtone playing)

06:25.818 --> 06:27.419
Hello?

06:27.453 --> 06:29.054
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have a collect call
from an inmate

06:29.088 --> 06:31.556
at the Arizona State Women's
Correctional Facility.

06:31.590 --> 06:33.591
To accept the call,
please press "one."

06:33.659 --> 06:34.826
(beep)

06:34.860 --> 06:36.695
CYNTHIA:
You don't want to see me.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.229
Cynthia.

06:38.297 --> 06:40.865
It's not like I have a lot
of great stories to tell.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.335
Sun comes up.
Sun goes down.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.370
I know because I watch
the shadows

06:45.404 --> 06:47.706
travel across my cell wall
all day.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.007
Now you know everything.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.976
Why don't you save yourself
the trip?

06:51.010 --> 06:52.978
I had a dream about you
last night.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.080
Was it good?
Do I get out of here?

06:55.114 --> 06:56.648
Lie. Give me hope.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.249
I'm not going to tell you.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.285
Not unless you let me
come and see you.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.855
(jet flying overhead)

07:06.659 --> 07:08.293
(sighs)

07:13.833 --> 07:16.034
Sorry I'm late.
It's fine.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.470
Actually, I'm not
going to be able to eat.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.239
I only have
a few minutes.

07:23.976 --> 07:26.044
You look anxious.

07:26.078 --> 07:27.779
No, no...

07:27.847 --> 07:28.980
Well, maybe a little.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.583
It's gone, Joe.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.953
I sold it.

07:35.021 --> 07:38.423
That deadline wasn't one
I picked arbitrarily.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.692
I needed to get your venture
off my books.

07:40.726 --> 07:43.595
I explained that to you.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.364
I felt I owed you the
opportunity to buy the company,

07:46.399 --> 07:48.333
and had you been able to come up
with the money,

07:48.401 --> 07:51.536
I'have happily
sold it to you, but...

07:51.604 --> 07:53.104
here we are.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.308
I didn't have much trouble
finding a buyer.

07:56.342 --> 07:58.710
You should be proud, Joe.

07:58.744 --> 08:01.579
You've built
an attractive little start-up.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.248
Who's the buyer?

08:03.282 --> 08:06.952
It's an outfit
called Tesseract Industrial.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.120
Out of San Diego.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.322
Coming on like gangbusters.

08:10.389 --> 08:13.058
It's run by a fellow
named Simon Burwell

08:13.092 --> 08:15.927
who's been
on a bit of a buying spree.

08:15.962 --> 08:18.596
What happens to me, Terry?

08:18.631 --> 08:22.267
Well, your contract is part
of the sale, so it'll be

08:22.301 --> 08:26.471
up to Tesseract to either keep
you on board or pay you off.

08:26.505 --> 08:29.841
Well, that's between
you and them.

08:29.875 --> 08:33.378
Look... (sighs)
I know how much

08:33.446 --> 08:36.514
this project meant to you,
and I know how painful

08:36.549 --> 08:39.884
it must be to realize you're
probably not going to be able

08:39.919 --> 08:41.919
to see it through
to the end.

08:41.953 --> 08:43.554
My advice to you?

08:43.623 --> 08:46.791
Get a good lawyer and make
them pay through the nose

08:46.826 --> 08:48.994
when they
try to settle with you.

08:49.028 --> 08:54.232
Money won't get rid of
all the pain, but it'll help.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.166
Waiter?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.869
Anything he wants.

08:57.903 --> 08:58.970
(loud buzzing)

09:02.308 --> 09:04.276
(indistinct chattering)

09:04.343 --> 09:05.310
Thank you.

09:07.146 --> 09:08.246
(loud buzzing)

09:13.819 --> 09:15.954
(indistinct chattering)

09:31.704 --> 09:34.606
It's wonderful to see you, too.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.448
I wasn't sure what you wanted,
what you needed.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.758
(inhaling)

09:55.661 --> 09:58.463
You're going to make me the most
popular girl on Block C.

09:58.497 --> 10:00.765
(laughs)

10:03.069 --> 10:06.371
I've been dreaming about this,
and I don't know why.

10:11.043 --> 10:13.111
First time I met Bethany

10:13.145 --> 10:15.614
was when I pulled her
out of that grave.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.849
I saw it.
The man in the mask.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.552
The bite mark
on his hand.

10:20.586 --> 10:23.455
The bite marks
were courtesy of Bethany.

10:23.489 --> 10:26.458
The night he buried her,
she fought back.

10:26.492 --> 10:29.294
She sunk her teeth in real deep.

10:29.328 --> 10:32.397
She wanted to hurt him,
mark him permanently.

10:32.431 --> 10:33.898
The way he did to her.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.735
They never caught him,
did they?

10:36.769 --> 10:39.004
What about the girl?

10:39.038 --> 10:40.605
Did you keep in touch?

10:40.673 --> 10:43.408
I heard some things.
Nothing good.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.477
The parents
were quite well off,

10:45.511 --> 10:47.145
before the kidnapping.

10:47.213 --> 10:50.715
The two million ransom
ruined them.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.617
The father committed suicide.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.552
The mother started
drinking very heavily,

10:54.620 --> 10:57.022
started taking drugs.

10:57.089 --> 11:00.659
She fell asleep one night
behind the wheel.

11:00.726 --> 11:03.595
Drove off a bridge.

11:03.629 --> 11:07.198
I want to say Bethany was... 15.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.602
And after that?

11:10.636 --> 11:12.837
After that,
there were more stories--

11:12.872 --> 11:14.806
foster homes, drugs...

11:14.874 --> 11:17.909
maybe prostitution.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.678
(sighs)

11:19.745 --> 11:21.813
Listen, Allison.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.382
I don't know why you're
asking me all these questions.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.851
I don't know why
this girl is in your dreams.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.587
And I don't know, for that
matter, why I'm in your dreams,

11:29.622 --> 11:32.057
but I want to make one thing
clear:

11:32.124 --> 11:34.426
I hate it here.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.364
I pray every night
that it'll end.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.799
I don't want visitors.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.335
I don't want friends.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.604
So, if you call me,
I won't answer the phone.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.372
And I won't see you.

11:47.406 --> 11:50.508
(ringtone playing)

11:52.345 --> 11:53.244
(ringtone stops)

11:53.312 --> 11:55.580
It's my husband.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.749
Must be nice.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.687
Bye, Allison.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.955
(plastic bag rustling)

12:03.990 --> 12:06.224
Thanks for the things.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.398
(elevator bell dings)

12:14.400 --> 12:15.734
(water running)

12:17.103 --> 12:18.470
MAN:
It's open.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.318
The concierge said
you were looking for someone

12:33.386 --> 12:35.654
to show you around Phoenix.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.025
He thought
I might know all the places

12:40.059 --> 12:42.027
you were interested in seeing.

12:42.061 --> 12:43.995
(water running)

12:50.736 --> 12:52.938
You in the shower?

12:55.708 --> 12:57.809
Need any help?

12:57.843 --> 13:00.779
MAN:
Nah. I'm okay.

13:00.813 --> 13:04.249
The donation for charity
is on the nightstand.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.756
Can I get you a drink?

13:11.824 --> 13:13.725
Don't worry
about me.

13:13.759 --> 13:16.661
Just make yourself
comfortable.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.163
(water shuts off)

13:18.230 --> 13:20.665
(shower door slides open)

13:22.935 --> 13:25.437
(towel rustling)

13:36.482 --> 13:40.685
So, uh...
you're my guide?

13:40.720 --> 13:43.121
Anywhere you want to go,
I'm sure I can get you there.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.992
You won't be needing this.

14:02.308 --> 14:04.376
(gasps)

14:04.410 --> 14:05.443
(sighs)

14:16.319 --> 14:18.554
I thought I told you.
I had another dream.

14:18.588 --> 14:19.988
I don't care.

14:20.056 --> 14:22.724
For God sakes! The
only freedom I have

14:22.792 --> 14:24.793
in here is the freedom to decide

14:24.861 --> 14:27.162
whether I want to see
other human beings or not.

14:27.230 --> 14:30.599
And you've figured
out a way to take
that away from me!

14:30.633 --> 14:31.967
Who do you think you're kidding,

14:32.035 --> 14:34.203
telling them
this is police business?

14:34.237 --> 14:35.671
This isn't police business.

14:35.705 --> 14:38.540
No one's died,
nothing's been stolen.

14:38.575 --> 14:42.244
Bethany has crossed paths
with her kidnapper.

14:42.278 --> 14:45.948
Bethany recognized
the bite mark on his hand.

14:45.982 --> 14:48.283
Cynthia, I think
this is why...

14:48.318 --> 14:50.719
this is why I've
been dreaming about her.

14:50.753 --> 14:53.689
I mean, she recognized him.

14:53.723 --> 14:56.491
Who's to say
he didn't recognize her?

14:56.559 --> 15:00.028
And if so, he couldn't just
let her walk out of the room.

15:00.096 --> 15:02.798
I have been making calls
all morning.

15:02.832 --> 15:05.934
She hasn't used
her credit card,
her cell phone.

15:06.035 --> 15:11.773
She hasn't picked up
her mail in a week.

15:11.875 --> 15:13.041
(sighs)

15:13.076 --> 15:15.344
You know, Allison...

15:15.378 --> 15:19.181
after you left the last time,

15:19.215 --> 15:21.083
I used up
all my phone privileges

15:21.117 --> 15:23.051
to try and get in touch
with Bethany.

15:23.119 --> 15:25.254
When that didn't work,

15:25.321 --> 15:26.989
I swapped all the
stuff that you brought

15:27.056 --> 15:28.857
and bought myself
some more.

15:28.925 --> 15:30.926
I called every old number
I had for Bethany.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.361
Left messages.

15:32.395 --> 15:35.464
I called every cop,

15:35.532 --> 15:38.967
every parole officer,
every youth counselor.

15:40.837 --> 15:42.804
And, you know...

15:42.872 --> 15:44.373
(sighs)

15:44.440 --> 15:47.876
...for those 40 minutes,
it was like...

15:47.911 --> 15:50.879
I wasn't in here at all.

15:50.914 --> 15:53.282
Did anything come of it?

15:53.316 --> 15:55.784
Did you make any connections?

15:57.053 --> 15:59.288
No.

15:59.355 --> 16:01.723
(sighs)

16:03.726 --> 16:05.961
(wheels rolling on floor)

16:14.504 --> 16:16.839
(elevator doors closing)

16:16.873 --> 16:18.707
(elevator whirring)

16:20.176 --> 16:21.310
(elevator door opening)

16:29.686 --> 16:31.620
(elevator door closing,
elevator whirring)

16:34.691 --> 16:37.025
(elevator door opening)

16:37.060 --> 16:38.060
There's nothing left.

16:38.094 --> 16:39.061
It's all gone, man.

16:39.095 --> 16:40.095
You guys are done!

16:40.163 --> 16:43.532
(singsongy):
It's all gone.

16:43.566 --> 16:47.069
Just have the office furniture
guy give me a call

16:47.103 --> 16:50.205
when you get to the warehouse
with a figure, all right?

16:52.942 --> 16:55.010
This mine or this yours?

16:55.044 --> 16:56.311
Well, that depends.

16:56.346 --> 16:57.179
Who are you?

16:57.213 --> 16:58.780
My name is Simon Burwell.

16:58.815 --> 16:59.848
I own Tesseract Industrial.

16:59.883 --> 17:01.216
Ah.
You are?

17:01.284 --> 17:02.718
My name's Joe Dubois.

17:02.752 --> 17:04.219
That's yours.

17:04.287 --> 17:07.589
Just make sure you turn off all
the lights when you're done.

17:07.656 --> 17:09.090
Where are you going?

17:09.125 --> 17:11.560
Oh, I've been told I have
to hire a really good lawyer

17:11.594 --> 17:13.095
so I can make you pay
through the nose

17:13.128 --> 17:15.763
when you try to
settle with me.

17:15.832 --> 17:17.566
What if I don't want
to settle with you?

17:17.634 --> 17:20.868
What if I want to honor your
contract, have you work for me?

17:25.575 --> 17:28.810
My wife put you up to this?

17:28.845 --> 17:32.080
I mean, frankly, I could
hire a mediocre engineer

17:32.182 --> 17:33.715
at half what you're
going to cost me

17:33.750 --> 17:35.350
to see this project
through to market,

17:35.385 --> 17:38.320
but I'd rather have
a great engineer.

17:38.388 --> 17:39.721
You know, I'd rather
have the guy

17:39.756 --> 17:41.156
who cooked
the whole thing up.

17:41.224 --> 17:42.925
I hear a "but"
in there.

17:42.959 --> 17:44.126
Where's the "but"?

17:44.160 --> 17:45.260
No, no. No "buts."

17:45.295 --> 17:47.496
None of consequence, anyways.

17:47.530 --> 17:49.498
How do you feel
about the ocean?

17:49.566 --> 17:51.700
You're going to drown me if
I don't come work for you?

17:51.734 --> 17:53.268
(laughs)

17:53.303 --> 17:55.971
We're in San Diego, Joe.

17:56.039 --> 17:57.339
We're all in San  Diego.

17:57.407 --> 17:58.974
It's beautiful.

17:59.042 --> 18:00.609
You know,
it's where we started,

18:00.643 --> 18:02.010
and it's, uh,
it's where we're staying,

18:02.078 --> 18:03.312
and it's where
you gotta be

18:03.379 --> 18:04.880
if you want to stay
with your baby.

18:04.914 --> 18:07.082
I've got a daughter who's
halfway through high school.

18:07.116 --> 18:09.585
My wife works for
the local DA.

18:09.652 --> 18:11.520
We have great schools.

18:11.554 --> 18:13.488
I don't know what kind
of work your wife does,

18:13.523 --> 18:14.923
but if she's good, we could
throw our weight around,

18:14.958 --> 18:15.991
we could make some calls.

18:16.059 --> 18:18.694
We're a big presence
in San Diego.

18:18.761 --> 18:20.562
It's not that simple.

18:20.630 --> 18:21.830
It is.

18:23.266 --> 18:24.366
We'll buy your house here.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.034
We'll help you find
a house there.

18:26.069 --> 18:27.336
You know, we do this
all the time.

18:29.005 --> 18:30.472
Did I mention the ocean?

18:32.809 --> 18:35.544
Special delivery
for Mrs. Dubois.

18:35.612 --> 18:37.713
What's this?

18:37.747 --> 18:39.214
It's all the files
on the Bethany Simmons' kidnap

18:39.249 --> 18:40.749
from 11 years ago;
I thought maybe you'd want

18:40.783 --> 18:42.084
to look through those.

18:42.151 --> 18:43.452
Thanks.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.521
I appreciate this.

18:45.555 --> 18:46.855
I appreciate all of this,

18:46.923 --> 18:49.558
especially knowing how busy
you are running around

18:49.626 --> 18:51.994
looking for that hothead,
Christopher Sipes' wife.

18:52.028 --> 18:53.362
Manny didn't tell you?

18:55.164 --> 18:56.331
All that went away.

18:56.366 --> 18:58.467
Ol' hothead phoned
this morning.

18:58.501 --> 19:00.369
Turns out the wife's okay.

19:00.436 --> 19:03.539
She called him last night
from a resort in Ixtapa, Mexico.

19:03.573 --> 19:05.541
Just felt the two of them
needed a little break.

19:05.608 --> 19:08.410
Are you saying that this woman
left the country

19:08.444 --> 19:09.745
without telling her husband?

19:09.812 --> 19:12.247
That so hard to believe?
You met the guy.

19:12.315 --> 19:13.849
Frankly, I think
she showed remarkable restraint

19:13.883 --> 19:15.184
by staying
in the same hemisphere.

19:19.556 --> 19:21.723
Hello?

19:21.758 --> 19:23.559
I'm home.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.527
It's about time.

19:25.562 --> 19:26.595
Your dinner's in the fridge.

19:26.663 --> 19:27.763
Ah...

19:27.830 --> 19:29.364
Where've you been?

19:29.399 --> 19:31.066
I was about to send out
the Phoenix Mounties.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.368
Mm, bookstore.

19:33.403 --> 19:34.603
Mm.
Hmm.

19:35.738 --> 19:37.372
(drop keys on table)

19:37.407 --> 19:39.808
Who went to the Grand Canyon?

19:39.876 --> 19:41.710
Nobody we know.

19:42.846 --> 19:44.680
"I have your daughter.

19:44.714 --> 19:47.049
"I will return her in exchange
for $2 million.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.852
Contact the police
and she will die."

19:49.886 --> 19:50.886
(shudders)

19:50.920 --> 19:52.187
Yeah, ransom note.

19:52.222 --> 19:54.189
Pretty cute, huh?

19:54.224 --> 19:56.725
11 years ago,
Bethany Simmons' kidnapper

19:56.759 --> 19:58.260
sent this note to her parents.

19:58.328 --> 20:00.562
The police recovered
a partial fingerprint,

20:00.630 --> 20:02.798
but they could never figure out
who it belonged to.

20:02.832 --> 20:04.766
So he just got away
with $2 million?

20:04.801 --> 20:05.968
Yup.

20:08.171 --> 20:09.771
Ooh. What did you get,

20:09.806 --> 20:11.740
a set of encyclopedias?

20:17.614 --> 20:19.982
What's with all these books
on San Diego?

20:20.016 --> 20:22.885
I met my new boss today.

20:24.687 --> 20:26.054
What do you
want me to say?

20:26.089 --> 20:27.155
Well, I don't know, Allison.

20:27.190 --> 20:28.590
What do you want me to say?

20:28.658 --> 20:29.892
A guy offers me a job

20:29.926 --> 20:31.960
doing something that I
desperately want to do

20:32.028 --> 20:35.731
at a time in history when
no one, no one is getting
offered any kind of a job.

20:35.765 --> 20:38.100
And, yeah, holy crap,
there's a little, you know,

20:38.168 --> 20:41.403
there's some inconvenience
and there's, you know,
some sacrifice involved.

20:41.437 --> 20:43.038
No, you're right,
you're right.

20:43.072 --> 20:44.907
All right, you know,
I'm sorry I brought it up.

20:44.974 --> 20:46.575
Come on, that's not fair.

20:46.609 --> 20:49.111
I mean, Ariel's going
to be a junior next year.

20:49.145 --> 20:51.313
She's going to be... she's going
to be applying for college

20:51.347 --> 20:53.115
in two years.
Okay, you're not saying anything

20:53.149 --> 20:54.216
that I didn't say.

20:54.284 --> 20:55.951
And, you know,
I have a job, too.

20:55.985 --> 20:58.320
Do you think I forgot?

20:58.354 --> 21:00.489
He said he'd help with that.

21:00.523 --> 21:01.957
(laughs incredulously)

21:01.991 --> 21:03.325
Uh-huh.

21:03.359 --> 21:05.394
That's what I did.

21:07.230 --> 21:11.033
I just... I don't think
that we can just say "no."

21:11.067 --> 21:16.438
I mean, it might be a beautiful,
grand, wonderful adventure.

21:16.472 --> 21:18.707
New house.

21:18.775 --> 21:20.375
New climate.
New friends.

21:20.443 --> 21:23.679
There are worse things.

21:23.746 --> 21:26.949
No. I hear that.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.318
I just...
I want you to sleep on it.

21:29.352 --> 21:30.786
<i>I mean, I want to sleep on it.</i>

21:37.760 --> 21:39.228
That's right, Mr. Devalos,
I, uh,

21:39.295 --> 21:40.128
I just got off the phone
with her.

21:40.196 --> 21:43.232
Mexico. Ixtapa.

21:43.266 --> 21:45.467
What did she say? Um...

21:45.502 --> 21:47.736
She said that
she needed a little bit of time

21:47.804 --> 21:52.574
to think about us,
think about our marriage.

21:52.642 --> 21:55.110
I don't know.
My head is spinning.

21:55.144 --> 21:56.311
I'm upset.

21:56.346 --> 21:58.780
I'm embarrassed.

21:58.815 --> 22:02.518
I know, I made an ass of myself
in your office.

22:03.853 --> 22:05.187
No, no.

22:05.221 --> 22:07.222
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

22:07.290 --> 22:10.259
I... apologize.

22:12.762 --> 22:15.931
I guess the important thing
is, um...

22:15.999 --> 22:18.834
my wife's just fine.

22:18.868 --> 22:20.235
(gasps)

22:30.144 --> 22:31.611
Wait a second.
Now you're telling me

22:31.646 --> 22:34.147
that Christopher Sipes' wife,
Amy, has been kidnapped?

22:34.215 --> 22:36.483
Yes, sir. And I'm almost certain
that she was taken

22:36.551 --> 22:38.451
by the same man who abducted
Bethany Simmons 11 years ago.

22:40.688 --> 22:43.089
The ransom note
is almost identical to this one.

22:43.157 --> 22:44.457
And not only that.

22:44.492 --> 22:46.593
I think that the kidnapper
may have recently

22:46.627 --> 22:49.062
crossed paths
with Bethany Simmons.

22:49.096 --> 22:51.331
I think he recognized her.

22:51.399 --> 22:54.134
And I think he did
something terrible to her.

22:54.168 --> 22:56.236
Well, this is all
very interesting, Allison,

22:56.304 --> 22:57.704
except for one thing.

22:57.738 --> 22:59.773
Christopher Sipes
has never contacted us

22:59.807 --> 23:00.941
about any kidnapping.

23:00.975 --> 23:02.475
Of course not.

23:02.577 --> 23:04.377
He's afraid to.

23:04.412 --> 23:06.213
Read that card again.

23:08.382 --> 23:11.017
"Contact the police
and she will die."

23:11.052 --> 23:12.152
<i>SIPES:
This is ridiculous.</i>

23:12.186 --> 23:13.420
Amy is fine.

23:13.454 --> 23:15.021
I discussed this
with you yesterday.

23:15.056 --> 23:16.990
She's-she's in Mexico.

23:17.024 --> 23:18.592
And we heard you,
but if, by chance,

23:18.626 --> 23:20.961
she wasn't fine,
if, by chance,

23:20.995 --> 23:23.830
there was something else
going on...

23:23.865 --> 23:25.298
Well, there's nothing else
going on,

23:25.333 --> 23:26.733
other than she's looking
for a little bit of peace,

23:26.801 --> 23:28.101
little bit of solitude.

23:28.169 --> 23:30.237
Then would you mind terribly
if we contacted her,

23:30.271 --> 23:31.404
just to confirm that?

23:31.439 --> 23:34.407
Yeah. In fact, I would.

23:34.442 --> 23:38.578
The woman wants
to be left alone.

23:38.613 --> 23:40.914
She's trying to decide
whether or not she wants

23:40.982 --> 23:42.516
to be married to me, all right?

23:42.550 --> 23:43.984
So, I think you two
would understand

23:44.018 --> 23:46.620
that I don't want to upset her.
I don't want to jeopardize that.

23:46.654 --> 23:49.656
If you'd like,
when she get back,

23:49.724 --> 23:50.690
I'll have her
call your office.

23:50.791 --> 23:53.393
So...

23:53.461 --> 23:55.495
Unless there's anything else,
you guys...

23:55.563 --> 23:57.664
Actually, there is.

23:57.698 --> 23:59.666
We don't believe that your
wife is spending time alone.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.067
We think she may
have been abducted.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.269
We think the man
who took her

24:02.336 --> 24:03.570
may have kidnapped
someone else.

24:03.604 --> 24:06.373
Mr. Sipes, if you won't
involve the authorities

24:06.407 --> 24:09.109
with your wife's case,
then it's far less likely

24:09.143 --> 24:11.011
we'll ever know what happened
to this other victim.

24:11.045 --> 24:15.148
I'm sorry to hear that,
but what do you want me to say?

24:15.183 --> 24:17.384
My wife is not missing.

24:17.485 --> 24:19.519
So there's no case
in which to involve you.

24:22.990 --> 24:24.357
(TV playing indistinctly)

24:24.392 --> 24:25.625
Hey.

24:25.693 --> 24:27.127
I'm home.

24:27.195 --> 24:29.029
You want to hear
something weird?

24:29.063 --> 24:32.532
I want to the pizza store
and they were all out of pizza.

24:32.567 --> 24:35.468
He gave me this
empty pizza box to take home

24:35.503 --> 24:38.338
so I would stop crying.

24:38.406 --> 24:40.473
(gasping)
Look, he tricked me!

24:40.508 --> 24:41.875
That's not funny.

24:41.943 --> 24:43.543
Bad Mommy, right?

24:43.578 --> 24:44.578
Oh.
Ooh, bad Mommy!

24:44.645 --> 24:46.746
Uh-uh.

24:46.781 --> 24:48.648
Hey, honey,
where's Ariel and your daddy?

24:48.716 --> 24:50.584
Well, Ariel's
in her room,

24:50.618 --> 24:52.786
and well, Daddy's
packing for California.

24:54.822 --> 24:57.390
Daddy's going to California?

25:00.328 --> 25:02.729
California? I thought
we had this conversation.

25:02.797 --> 25:05.332
Well, we said we'd
sleep on it, right?

25:05.399 --> 25:07.901
Okay, so how
did you sleep?

25:07.935 --> 25:10.470
I slept pretty soundly,
actually pretty good.

25:10.505 --> 25:12.706
I woke up pretty much convinced
it didn't make a lot of sense

25:12.740 --> 25:15.742
to work for a company
that was based in San Diego.

25:15.776 --> 25:17.410
I mean, not if they were going
to make me work there, too.

25:17.445 --> 25:19.579
You know?
'Cause we got our roots here

25:19.614 --> 25:21.081
and the kids and the family

25:21.115 --> 25:23.183
and your job and all that, so...

25:23.251 --> 25:25.151
Okay, that's kind
of how I slept, too.

25:25.186 --> 25:26.253
So why are you going
to California?

25:26.320 --> 25:27.521
'Cause this guy

25:27.555 --> 25:29.256
Simon Burwell called me.

25:29.323 --> 25:32.392
I guess he didn't sleep
as soundly as we did.

25:32.426 --> 25:34.194
Well, he didn't call.
His office called.

25:34.228 --> 25:37.797
I guess he's, you know,
he's got a proposition for me.

25:37.832 --> 25:41.768
He wants to buy me lunch
tomorrow in San Diego.

25:41.802 --> 25:44.638
He sent me you know, a first-class 
ticket and everything.

25:44.672 --> 25:46.973
Okay, but if you're
not interested...

25:47.008 --> 25:48.975
See, that is the difference
between you and me.

25:49.043 --> 25:51.978
See, I suspect a lot,
but I know very little.

25:52.013 --> 25:54.514
It's just a proposition.

25:54.549 --> 25:58.752
I mean, there are almost,
like, no jobs out there.

25:58.819 --> 26:02.389
How do I... how do I not even
listen to this guy?

26:02.423 --> 26:06.326
I made it very clear
that this family is not moving.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.329
Okay, so, just let him
woo you over the phone.

26:09.397 --> 26:11.431
The whole trip is going
to take, like, six hours.

26:11.465 --> 26:13.033
I'll be home before dinner.

26:13.067 --> 26:14.668
Speaking of whh...

26:14.735 --> 26:15.836
It's in the kitchen.

26:15.870 --> 26:17.103
It's the round thing
in the square box.

26:17.171 --> 26:18.371
Excellent. My favorite.

26:35.323 --> 26:35.388
"I buried your wife an hour ago.

26:37.091 --> 26:40.927
She has approximately
five minutes of air left."

26:40.962 --> 26:42.729
(gun cocking)

26:46.400 --> 26:48.268
Look, I don't...
I don't understand.

26:48.336 --> 26:49.970
I did what you said.
I brought the money.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.374
(gasping)

26:57.512 --> 26:59.346
(doorbell ringing)

27:01.883 --> 27:04.150
What the hell are
you doing here?

27:04.218 --> 27:05.652
I'm sorry.
I just had to make sure

27:05.686 --> 27:06.853
I got to you before you left.

27:06.921 --> 27:08.922
Left? Left for where?

27:08.990 --> 27:10.457
To pay the ransom.

27:12.293 --> 27:15.161
You know what
I'm talking about, don't you?

27:15.196 --> 27:16.496
Mr. Sipes?

27:16.531 --> 27:19.599
Do you know who I am?
Do you know what I do?

27:19.634 --> 27:22.769
I know who you
say you are.

27:22.803 --> 27:25.205
I know what you
purport to be.

27:25.239 --> 27:27.607
I already saw everything
that's going to happen.

27:27.675 --> 27:29.609
The spot in the desert
where it all takes place.

27:29.644 --> 27:31.211
The two green duffle bags

27:31.245 --> 27:35.048
that you're going to use
to carry the money.

27:35.082 --> 27:36.783
The kidnapper
is going to double-cross you.

27:36.817 --> 27:39.252
When you give him those bags,
he's going to shoot you.

27:39.287 --> 27:42.022
And he's going to leave
your wife there to die.

27:42.089 --> 27:44.491
Please, let me help you.

27:44.559 --> 27:48.161
Call my boss.
Tell him everything you know.

27:48.229 --> 27:51.164
Do you know what I do
for a living, Mrs. Dubois?

27:51.199 --> 27:53.567
I buy and I sell real estate.

27:53.601 --> 27:56.937
I do it without lawyers, without
bankers, without brokers.

27:57.004 --> 27:59.072
Just me.

27:59.106 --> 28:02.108
Staring into the eyes of whoever
it is I'm doing business with.

28:02.176 --> 28:05.111
And that's what
got me here.

28:05.146 --> 28:09.082
Now, I'm not admitting
that someone has taken my wife.

28:09.150 --> 28:10.917
But if someone ever did...

28:10.952 --> 28:16.056
I'd look them in the eye,
ask them what they wanted,

28:16.090 --> 28:19.359
then make the best damn deal
that I could.

28:19.393 --> 28:22.863
Now, maybe they'd shoot me...

28:22.930 --> 28:24.397
but I doubt it.

28:24.465 --> 28:27.701
It's bad business.

28:27.735 --> 28:29.736
There'no upside.

28:29.770 --> 28:34.774
But you wouldn't
understand that.

28:34.809 --> 28:37.577
That's why I live
in this big house

28:37.612 --> 28:40.146
and you drive
that piece of crap that you do.

28:40.181 --> 28:43.250
Now, get off of
my front porch.

28:48.389 --> 28:50.223
(ringtone playing)

28:51.792 --> 28:53.293
Hello?

28:53.327 --> 28:55.462
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have a collect call
from an inmate

28:55.496 --> 28:57.163
at the Arizona State Women's
Correctional Facility.

28:57.198 --> 29:00.800
To accept the call,
please press "one."

29:00.835 --> 29:01.768
CYNTHIA:
She called!

29:01.802 --> 29:02.936
Bethany?

29:02.970 --> 29:04.838
Yeah. Bethany. She called.

29:04.872 --> 29:08.041
Her parole officer gave her
the message and she called.

29:08.109 --> 29:09.709
You're kidding.
What did she say?

29:09.744 --> 29:10.844
Where has she been?

29:10.878 --> 29:13.647
Off the wagon,
doing drugs, worse.

29:13.681 --> 29:15.882
She wanted me to know
she was on top of it.

29:15.917 --> 29:19.986
She started meetings yesterday.
She's 24 hours clean and sober

29:20.021 --> 29:21.922
and she sounded pretty positive.

29:21.956 --> 29:23.123
Well, that's great.

29:23.157 --> 29:25.425
I told her that, um,

29:25.459 --> 29:29.529
if she, uh, you know, felt like
coming by, I'd like to see her.

29:29.597 --> 29:35.068
And, um, same goes for you,
if, you know,

29:35.102 --> 29:38.638
you'd like to drop by and visit.

29:38.706 --> 29:40.473
Of course.

29:40.541 --> 29:42.275
Okay. I got to go.

29:42.310 --> 29:44.177
Oh, Cynthia.

29:44.212 --> 29:46.513
Thanks for calling.

29:46.581 --> 29:48.348
Yeah, okay. Bye.

29:51.352 --> 29:54.187
Mr. Burwell.

29:54.255 --> 29:56.256
Sorry. Am I late?

29:56.324 --> 29:58.091
No, no. No,
you're early.
Oh, good.

29:58.125 --> 29:59.125
I'm just earlier.

29:59.193 --> 30:00.427
Okay.

30:00.461 --> 30:01.795
Please call me Simon.

30:01.863 --> 30:05.432
Simon. Thank you.
Thank you.

30:05.466 --> 30:07.701
Did I mention the ocean?

30:07.768 --> 30:12.138
I just, uh... Oh, God.

30:12.206 --> 30:14.975
I don't know how I'm going
to make this work.

30:15.009 --> 30:16.576
It's a family thing, right?
Yeah.

30:16.611 --> 30:19.679
Moving? I get that.

30:19.747 --> 30:22.215
I just... You know,
I really hate the idea

30:22.250 --> 30:23.283
of doing this without you.

30:23.351 --> 30:26.920
I don't know what to tell you.

30:26.954 --> 30:28.221
All right. Okay.

30:28.256 --> 30:30.223
We're engineers.

30:30.258 --> 30:31.925
We're supposed to
be problem solvers.

30:31.959 --> 30:33.393
Solution brokers.

30:33.427 --> 30:35.996
Let me... let me hit you
with a potential solution.

30:36.030 --> 30:39.199
All right? You tell
me what you think.

30:39.233 --> 30:40.600
Don't leave Phoenix.

30:40.635 --> 30:43.136
My God, you're a genius.

30:43.171 --> 30:44.037
Yeah, hold that thought.

30:44.071 --> 30:46.306
What I meant to say was, um...

30:46.340 --> 30:47.941
Don't have your
family leave Phoenix.

30:47.975 --> 30:49.843
You know, they stay
put. You come here.

30:49.877 --> 30:51.645
Like you did today.
You get on a plane.

30:51.679 --> 30:52.913
You do your work.
Finish your work.

30:52.947 --> 30:54.281
You get back on a plane.

30:54.348 --> 30:56.449
So, I would work here for,
like, five days a week?

30:56.517 --> 30:57.517
Yeah.

30:57.552 --> 30:58.985
A lot of people do it.

30:59.020 --> 31:00.387
Yeah, I know. I know
a lot of people do it.

31:00.421 --> 31:02.689
I just... I don't think
that I could.

31:02.723 --> 31:05.225
Being a husband and a father,
you know, just for weekends,

31:05.259 --> 31:07.761
I don't think
that's going to work for us.

31:07.795 --> 31:09.462
I don't think
that's going to work for me.

31:09.497 --> 31:13.033
All right. Okay. Let
me reengineer this.

31:13.067 --> 31:16.069
What if I said I want you in
San Diego three days a week?

31:16.103 --> 31:17.470
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

31:17.538 --> 31:21.174
Then Monday, Friday you stay in
Phoenix, telecommute from home.

31:21.242 --> 31:23.009
Tesseract will pay
all your travel,

31:23.044 --> 31:25.245
set you up with
an apartment here.

31:25.279 --> 31:26.780
And that way, you
see your kids.

31:26.848 --> 31:28.615
See your wife.

31:28.649 --> 31:31.318
And you get to finish
what you started.

31:31.385 --> 31:35.422
And... And I will still
throw in the ocean.

31:38.793 --> 31:40.760
(door opening)
JOE: I'm home!

31:40.795 --> 31:42.495
Daddy's home!

31:42.563 --> 31:43.864
Hey.
Hey.

31:43.898 --> 31:45.298
I told you I would be
home before dinner.

31:46.567 --> 31:47.734
Hey, what's
in the bag?

31:47.768 --> 31:48.835
What's in the bag?

31:48.870 --> 31:51.171
Oh, oh, oh...

31:53.941 --> 31:55.509
San Diego?

31:55.543 --> 31:59.079
I got one for everyone.

31:59.113 --> 32:00.914
(dog barking)

32:04.719 --> 32:07.220
You have to admit,
this man is twisting himself

32:07.255 --> 32:09.389
into a pretzel
to make this thing work.

32:09.457 --> 32:10.857
Okay, I admit it. Do
I have to like it, too?

32:10.892 --> 32:13.326
Allison, this is a chance for
me to see this thing through.

32:13.361 --> 32:15.095
To its completion.

32:15.129 --> 32:16.730
And this means
everything to me.

32:16.797 --> 32:17.931
No, I know that.

32:17.965 --> 32:21.001
This could mean everything
to our future.

32:21.035 --> 32:24.004
And it's a chance
for me to keep working.

32:24.038 --> 32:27.107
I don't think you understand
how bleak it is out there.

32:27.141 --> 32:28.575
No, I do.
Okay, then.

32:28.643 --> 32:30.877
Well, tell me
that you're okay with this.

32:30.912 --> 32:33.713
I'm okay with this.

32:33.748 --> 32:35.582
Really? 'Cause you don't
look okay, Allison.

32:35.650 --> 32:38.285
I mean, I really... I don't
think that you truly understand.

32:38.319 --> 32:41.121
I understand. I understand.
Three nights and three days,

32:41.155 --> 32:43.557
each and every week,
you're not going to be here.

32:43.624 --> 32:45.759
And it's...
It's not that I'm afraid

32:45.826 --> 32:48.628
that my life is going
to get that much harder.

32:48.663 --> 32:51.998
I'm just sad about all
the things you're going to miss.

32:52.033 --> 32:54.968
The homework you're not going
to be able to help with.

32:55.002 --> 32:56.736
The tucking in,
the kisses good night

32:56.838 --> 32:58.505
you're not going to
be able to give them.

32:58.539 --> 32:59.606
But I get it.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.408
I get all the rest of it.

33:01.442 --> 33:03.476
You have a dream.
We got a mortgage to pay.

33:03.544 --> 33:05.045
I get that.

33:05.079 --> 33:08.815
And even though I'm sad
for them, and I'm sad for me,

33:08.883 --> 33:10.917
I really am happy for you.

33:10.985 --> 33:13.587
You just can't see that.

33:13.654 --> 33:16.156
Or maybe I can't show that
to you right now,

33:16.190 --> 33:17.390
and I'm sorry about that.

33:24.632 --> 33:26.399
Are you awake?

33:26.434 --> 33:28.268
(quietly):
N... No.

33:28.302 --> 33:31.137
(sighs)

33:31.172 --> 33:33.573
I'll miss you.

33:35.710 --> 33:37.944
I already miss you.

33:38.012 --> 33:41.114
Well, that's your own fault--
I haven't even left yet,

33:41.148 --> 33:43.683
and you're already
acting like I'm gone.

33:43.718 --> 33:44.951
Shut up.

33:44.986 --> 33:46.853
(grunts)
(chuckles)

33:51.225 --> 33:53.527
We'll tell the kids
in the morning?

33:53.594 --> 33:55.328
Tell the kids
in the morning.

33:55.396 --> 33:56.963
And it's good
news, right?

33:57.031 --> 33:59.332
Not the going-away part,
but the job part.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.902
Seeing something through
till its finished part.

34:01.969 --> 34:04.070
It's good news.

34:04.105 --> 34:06.406
So, what happened
with the girl,
the missing girl?

34:06.440 --> 34:08.241
Did you find her?

34:08.309 --> 34:10.409
Do you really care?

34:10.444 --> 34:13.213
Yeah, I care-- I mean, I
care about you, so yeah.

34:13.313 --> 34:14.246
I... I care.

34:16.449 --> 34:19.018
Well, turns out she
never really was missing.

34:19.085 --> 34:22.389
(laughs):
I was wrong.

34:22.456 --> 34:26.659
Seems like I'm wrong
about so many things lately.

34:28.362 --> 34:29.696
Mm-mm.

34:36.637 --> 34:40.206
¶ ¶

34:40.241 --> 34:42.275
Hey, hey.

34:42.310 --> 34:44.210
You all right?

34:44.277 --> 34:46.813
You look like you
just saw a ghost.

34:48.014 --> 34:49.583
Sorry.

34:51.284 --> 34:54.020
You ever get that thing, um...

34:54.054 --> 34:56.922
where you see somebody
really familiar?

34:56.958 --> 34:59.326
For a second there in the dark

34:59.360 --> 35:01.795
you just looked like someone
I used to know.

35:02.997 --> 35:05.131
Somebody you like?

35:06.434 --> 35:08.435
Yeah.

35:08.469 --> 35:10.770
It was a long time ago, though.

35:10.838 --> 35:13.673
I'm sure he wouldn't
recognize me now.

35:20.081 --> 35:22.682
Yeah, I liked him.

35:22.717 --> 35:25.252
I'm sure I'll
probably like you, too.

35:25.286 --> 35:28.188
Oh, I'm certain of it.

35:31.792 --> 35:36.263
You know, seeing you like that,
all wet, it's kind of sexy.

35:38.599 --> 35:41.201
I was thinking
I might need a shower,

35:41.235 --> 35:44.037
and a big, strong man
to soap me up.

35:45.840 --> 35:48.175
Yeah. Let's do it.

35:48.276 --> 35:51.211
How about you run on in there
and get the water going,

35:51.245 --> 35:53.280
I'll be right behind you.

36:02.990 --> 36:05.825
(shower running)

36:08.529 --> 36:10.230
(shower turns off)

36:10.264 --> 36:12.866
(shower running)

36:12.900 --> 36:14.100
(laughs softly)

36:14.135 --> 36:16.269
Christopher Dennis Sipes.

36:16.337 --> 36:18.338
(gasps softly)

36:27.594 --> 36:30.363
Would you just give me a second?

36:32.799 --> 36:34.333
Hey, Allison.

36:37.004 --> 36:39.939
What's with the armed escort?

36:40.007 --> 36:41.574
They're for you.

36:41.608 --> 36:43.075
So's this.

36:43.110 --> 36:44.577
(unzips bag)

36:47.347 --> 36:48.981
Clothes?

36:49.016 --> 36:50.116
Cynthia,

36:50.183 --> 36:53.786
the dream I told you about,
it happened.

36:53.820 --> 36:56.255
Bethany crossed paths
with the man who kidnapped her.

36:56.290 --> 36:58.824
Only he didn't recognize her;
she recognized him.

36:58.859 --> 37:00.159
Allison, calm down.

37:00.193 --> 37:02.828
I told you,
she called, she's fine.

37:02.863 --> 37:05.064
No. No, Cynthia,
she is not fine.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.599
She's in real trouble.

37:06.667 --> 37:08.367
The reason that
she called you is,

37:08.402 --> 37:10.836
she wanted you to stop
asking people where she was.

37:10.904 --> 37:12.538
She didn't want
anyone to know.

37:12.573 --> 37:13.873
Know? Know what?

37:13.941 --> 37:15.975
That she had decided
to get even.

37:16.009 --> 37:17.877
She got his name and address.

37:17.911 --> 37:19.879
She kidnapped his wife.

37:19.913 --> 37:23.349
Cynthia, once this man,
Christopher Sipes,

37:23.383 --> 37:25.818
makes that ransom drop,
Bethany plans on shooting him

37:25.886 --> 37:29.088
and leaving his wife to die
in a shallow grave.

37:29.122 --> 37:30.990
I saw it, Cynthia.

37:31.024 --> 37:32.792
Look, I'm worried

37:32.859 --> 37:35.261
that he has already
gone to make the drop.

37:35.295 --> 37:38.664
It-it's the perfect revenge.

37:38.699 --> 37:41.234
She even has Sipes
making the drop at the exact

37:41.268 --> 37:42.935
same place where
he buried her,

37:43.003 --> 37:45.905
in the middle of the desert,
in the middle of nowhere.

37:45.939 --> 37:47.740
And no one who worked
the original case

37:47.808 --> 37:48.975
knows exactly where that was.

37:49.009 --> 37:51.310
No one really knows.

37:51.411 --> 37:53.846
Except Bethany.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.414
And you.

37:55.449 --> 37:58.384
(shovel digging)

38:05.926 --> 38:07.927
(bird cawing)

38:09.930 --> 38:11.931
(birds chirping)

38:11.965 --> 38:13.232
CYNTHIA:
Bethany.

38:15.002 --> 38:16.836
(bird cawing)

38:16.904 --> 38:19.372
(laughs quietly):
Well...

38:19.406 --> 38:20.973
long time, no see.

38:21.008 --> 38:23.910
Didn't I just
call you in prison?

38:23.944 --> 38:26.512
What the hell
are you doing here?

38:28.682 --> 38:30.917
I had a pang of nostalgia.

38:30.951 --> 38:32.652
I told the police

38:32.686 --> 38:36.055
I'd be able to lead them
to a scene of a kidnapping.

38:36.089 --> 38:38.024
I told them that, uh,

38:38.091 --> 38:41.427
I could get the kidnapper
to come with me quietly,

38:41.495 --> 38:45.164
stop her from making
a terrible mistake.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.199
(bird screeches in distance)

38:47.234 --> 38:48.935
Come on, Bethany.

38:48.969 --> 38:51.637
You're many things,
but you're not stupid.

38:51.672 --> 38:53.839
They've got sharpshooters
all around here,

38:53.874 --> 38:55.207
behind every rock,

38:55.275 --> 38:58.544
just waiting for an opportunity
to pull the trigger.

38:58.579 --> 39:00.947
It's a win-win
situation for them.

39:00.981 --> 39:04.016
As far as they're concerned,
you've buried a woman alive.

39:05.552 --> 39:08.854
But we know
that's not true, don't we?

39:08.889 --> 39:12.258
We know you'd never
let that happen,

39:12.326 --> 39:14.360
not after what happened to you.

39:18.532 --> 39:21.334
So give me the gun.

39:21.368 --> 39:23.970
Give me the gun and tell me
where the lady is.

39:24.004 --> 39:25.304
Why are you doing this?

39:25.339 --> 39:27.506
You know that
he deserves to die.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.442
Yes, and he will.

39:29.476 --> 39:31.310
But not by your hand.

39:31.378 --> 39:33.279
(cocks hammer)

39:38.585 --> 39:40.786
You know...

39:40.821 --> 39:43.923
when I shot
my daughter's killer,

39:43.957 --> 39:45.458
I was so certain

39:45.492 --> 39:48.327
of what I was doing.

39:48.362 --> 39:53.165
But I was walking around
with this big hole inside me.

39:53.233 --> 39:57.536
And I thought if I killed her,
it would all just go away.

39:57.571 --> 40:00.439
But you know what?

40:00.507 --> 40:05.177
(whispers):
I still miss my daughter
every day.

40:05.212 --> 40:08.047
And I've still got
this hole inside me.

40:10.584 --> 40:11.851
Now...

40:11.885 --> 40:14.086
give me that gun, Bethany.

40:14.121 --> 40:16.622
What about Sipes?

40:16.690 --> 40:18.691
What happens to him?

40:18.725 --> 40:21.427
Oh, he'll get what he deserves.

40:23.297 --> 40:25.965
You know, he left a fingerprint

40:25.999 --> 40:29.101
on that ransom note that he sent
to your parents,

40:29.136 --> 40:31.437
and we can match
that bite mark

40:31.471 --> 40:33.973
on his hand
to your teeth.

40:34.007 --> 40:37.343
It's all over for him.

40:37.411 --> 40:41.247
He already took your
mother and your father.

40:42.783 --> 40:44.750
Don't give him you, too.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.620
(whispers):
That's right.

40:47.654 --> 40:49.188
That's my girl.

40:50.257 --> 40:52.225
(sniffling)

40:52.259 --> 40:53.292
Good girl.

40:53.327 --> 40:55.895
(sirens wailing in distance)

40:57.297 --> 40:59.131
Good girl.

41:02.536 --> 41:03.769
(birds chirping)

41:03.804 --> 41:06.105
(indistinct radio transmission)

41:12.446 --> 41:14.313
ALLISON:
Well, they just found

41:14.348 --> 41:15.681
Amy Sipes.

41:15.716 --> 41:18.150
She was groggy,
but she was still alive.

41:18.185 --> 41:20.620
She was exactly
where Bethany said she'd be.

41:20.654 --> 41:23.456
I knew Bethany
couldn't hurt her.

41:24.858 --> 41:27.393
Well, there's my ride.

41:28.695 --> 41:29.629
Oh...

41:31.531 --> 41:34.100
Thanks.
No,

41:34.134 --> 41:36.135
thank you for...

41:36.203 --> 41:38.004
for doing this.

41:41.375 --> 41:43.676
Cynthia.

41:43.744 --> 41:46.212
You have a parole hearing
coming up soon.

41:46.280 --> 41:47.980
Yeah. My first.

41:48.015 --> 41:49.916
Well, my boss
wants to go.

41:49.950 --> 41:52.051
He wants to speak on your behalf

41:52.085 --> 41:54.487
to tell the board
about everything you did here.

41:54.521 --> 41:56.055
If that's okay.

41:56.123 --> 41:59.025
Tell him to come on by
if he wants to discuss it.

42:00.994 --> 42:05.298
Make sure he brings you
with him.
