00:02.770 --> 00:04.770
you got your homework done?

00:05.100 --> 00:06.980
- All of it?
- Yep.

00:06.990 --> 00:10.470
Hmm, attaboy! Now you just
get to kick back this weekend.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.420
That's my plan.

00:12.430 --> 00:13.960
Except...

00:13.970 --> 00:15.580
except nothing.

00:15.590 --> 00:17.950
Oh, well, excuse me.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.580
- Oh, yeah.
- There it is.

00:24.620 --> 00:27.020
I might have to write a
book report for monday.

00:27.030 --> 00:28.980
What do you mean you might
have to write a book report?

00:28.990 --> 00:32.650
I mean if there's no earthquake by monday
morning, I have to write a book report.

00:32.659 --> 00:35.400
Oh, god... so what's the book?

00:35.410 --> 00:37.880
William shakespeare's
the taming of the shrew.

00:37.890 --> 00:40.010
By william shakespeare.

00:41.030 --> 00:45.070
Hey, that'll come in handy when he's mopping
out the toilets at the house of pancakes.

00:46.260 --> 00:48.600
You know, I could go for some pancakes.

00:48.610 --> 00:51.480
Jake, please tell me you read the book.

00:51.490 --> 00:53.650
I really wish I could, dad.

00:54.260 --> 00:55.280
Oh, jeez.

00:55.290 --> 00:57.290
I was going to read
it, but I can't find it.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.690
You lost the book?

00:58.700 --> 01:00.890
So what do you intend
to do about the report?

01:00.900 --> 01:03.420
You mean aside from the earthquake?

01:04.150 --> 01:05.480
Yeah.

01:05.489 --> 01:08.980
Well, I kind of put all my
eggs in the earthquake basket.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.010
Go get dressed. We're
going to go to the store.

01:11.020 --> 01:13.050
- Well, can we stop for pancakes?
- Go!

01:15.280 --> 01:18.920
I bet you're sorry you took
all that lsd before you had him.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.350
I never took any lsd.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.520
You might want to start
telling people you did.

01:35.260 --> 01:38.040
******** to write this book report.

01:38.050 --> 01:40.600
Get over it, dad.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.300
Yeah, alan, relax.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.920
He'll have eight weeks
of summer school to do it.

01:45.530 --> 01:47.790
Unless there's an earthquake.

01:48.490 --> 01:50.070
Oh, excuse me.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.490
Could you tell me where the
classic literature section is?

01:52.520 --> 01:54.950
- Third floor near the restroom.
- Thank you.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.000
You guys go ahead. I'm
gonna look at some magazines.

01:57.010 --> 02:00.060
They don't sell those kinds
of magazines here. I checked.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.730
Come on, you little
perv. Meet me back here.

02:04.740 --> 02:07.990
Wait. Was that an earthquake?

02:10.560 --> 02:12.450
Can help you find anything?

02:12.460 --> 02:14.950
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a book.

02:17.890 --> 02:19.790
You probably need more than that.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.840
I want a book about, you
know, relationship stuff.

02:22.860 --> 02:25.510
Ooh, relationship stuff.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.630
No, not "ooh, relationship
stuff," just relationship stuff.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.530
It's in the self-help section.

02:32.540 --> 02:33.870
Thanks.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.470
Best of luck.

02:38.770 --> 02:41.570
This is worse than buying condoms.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.580
Okay, let's see.

02:44.590 --> 02:47.450
Why relationships fail.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.310
Smart women, foolish choices.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.670
Thank god for those gals.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.750
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.230
Oh, embracing your soul mate?

02:58.250 --> 02:59.620
"Soul mate."

02:59.630 --> 03:01.790
I thought it was "cell mate."

03:02.250 --> 03:04.430
You know, a prison love story?

03:04.460 --> 03:05.770
Mm, I see.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.170
Not that I'm into prison love stories.

03:08.190 --> 03:11.010
I like the girls in prison stuff.

03:11.780 --> 03:14.140
Oh, who am I kidding?

03:14.510 --> 03:16.680
I'm looking for some help, okay?

03:16.880 --> 03:17.880
Well, you're not alone.

03:17.890 --> 03:20.180
There are millions of people
out there looking for help.

03:20.190 --> 03:22.950
Gee, thanks for making me feel special.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.670
Let me ask you something.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.710
What would you change
about yourself if you could?

03:28.720 --> 03:30.410
I don't know, little things, I guess.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.470
Like what?

03:31.560 --> 03:34.170
Oh, well, I guess I'd like
to be a little happier.

03:34.180 --> 03:37.890
Maybe find a way to sustain a healthy
relationship with a woman so I don't,

03:37.900 --> 03:42.670
you know, grow old and die
alone, incontinent and unloved.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.860
Ah, yes, the little things.

03:46.870 --> 03:49.020
Can I recommend a book for you?

03:49.030 --> 03:51.770
Well, as long as I'm here.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.650
Breaking barriers: Finding
the intimacy you deserve.

04:00.660 --> 04:03.870
I don't know, I was hoping
to do better than I deserve.

04:03.880 --> 04:04.880
Give it a chance.

04:04.890 --> 04:06.710
I hear it's helped a lot of people.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.900
For 25 bucks, it better wash my car.

04:12.510 --> 04:14.900
Wait a minute. Is this you?

04:14.910 --> 04:17.100
Armor all is extra.

04:17.110 --> 04:19.390
Oh, cool. Will you sign it for me?

04:19.399 --> 04:20.649
Oh, I'd be happy to. What's your name?

04:20.660 --> 04:23.090
- Charlie.
- Okay.

04:24.010 --> 04:28.200
Now, that it's autographed,
I'm not a lose I'm a collector.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.860
Here you go.

04:32.910 --> 04:37.720
"To charlie, reading a self-help
book doesn't make you less of a man."

04:38.490 --> 04:41.140
Okay, back to loser.

04:41.450 --> 04:42.610
You're not a loser, charlie.

04:42.620 --> 04:45.240
Like most men, you're just
afraid to be vulnerable.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.840
Excuse me, but what sane
person wants to be vulnerable?

04:48.850 --> 04:51.530
If you're not vulnerable,
you can't feel anything.

04:51.540 --> 04:53.840
Yeah, and?

04:53.860 --> 04:55.780
Read the book.

04:56.510 --> 04:58.590
Wait.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.490
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

05:00.500 --> 05:01.490
Why?

05:01.500 --> 05:03.320
I'd like to talk to you some more.

05:03.330 --> 05:05.540
Are you still gonna buy the book?

05:05.550 --> 05:08.410
I have to. You wrote all over it.

05:08.930 --> 05:11.300
- Then sure, why not?
- Great.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.680
Listen, if I give you the
money, will you pay for it?

05:13.690 --> 05:16.480
I don't need any more
sympathy from the help.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.850
What's a shrew anyway?

05:18.870 --> 05:20.580
Oh, it's a small rodent.

05:20.590 --> 05:23.060
Oh, so this is like stuart little?

05:23.070 --> 05:27.370
No, no, it's about a man trying
to control a willful, angry woman.

05:27.390 --> 05:30.220
Is he trying to control
her with rodents?

05:31.510 --> 05:33.700
I don't want to spoil it for you.

05:33.710 --> 05:36.840
Let's just find your uncle
charlie and get out of here.

05:36.850 --> 05:37.960
Excuse me, uh...

05:37.970 --> 05:41.540
have you seen a guy, um, dark
hair, bowling shirt, shorts?

05:41.550 --> 05:43.560
Oh, yeah, the self-help guy.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.410
No, that doesn't sound like him.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.950
Well, a guy like that just
left with a pretty blonde woman.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.450
That sounds like him.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.530
Dad, this is the wrong book.

05:52.540 --> 05:53.550
What are you talking about?

05:53.560 --> 05:56.120
It's in some sort of foreign language.

05:56.130 --> 05:57.790
It's elizabethan.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.310
Well, can we get one in english?

06:00.800 --> 06:02.540
Walk.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.560
How could you have
already lost the book?

06:09.570 --> 06:12.290
I didn't do it on purpose!
What are you yelling at me for?

06:12.300 --> 06:15.860
'Cause it's one of the few
pleasures of being your father!

06:17.400 --> 06:18.830
Oh, look who's here!

06:18.840 --> 06:20.410
Thanks a lot.

06:20.420 --> 06:21.210
What did I do?

06:21.220 --> 06:22.620
You stranded us at the mall.

06:22.630 --> 06:23.950
We had to take the bus home.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.140
The bus!

06:25.150 --> 06:28.380
I left the book on the
bus. There. Mystery solved.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.690
Go get in the car.

06:30.700 --> 06:31.480
Where are we going?

06:31.510 --> 06:33.950
Where do you think we're going?

06:33.960 --> 06:36.860
Well, we never did get those pancakes.

06:37.810 --> 06:40.200
We're going back to the bookstore
to buy another damn book.

06:40.210 --> 06:41.930
And this one's coming
out of your allowance.

06:41.940 --> 06:43.960
What allowance?

06:45.610 --> 06:47.700
Wait. I'm supposed to
be getting an allowance?

06:47.710 --> 06:49.960
Go get your shoes.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.280
- Did you guys feel that?
- Move it!

07:01.440 --> 07:02.670
So guess what?

07:02.680 --> 07:06.350
I'm going to transform my life
and get the intimacy I dervrve.

07:06.790 --> 07:07.720
Fantastic.

07:07.730 --> 07:10.710
You work on that while I go
back to the mall with taterhead.

07:12.290 --> 07:15.540
Not only that, I met the
author, and she's amazing.

07:15.550 --> 07:16.770
Is this the woman you dumped us for?

07:16.790 --> 07:18.470
Yeah, and you know what she told me?

07:18.500 --> 07:19.610
No idea.

07:19.620 --> 07:23.860
She told me that my fear of being hurt
keeps me from feeling anything at all.

07:23.880 --> 07:27.070
It's like I'm like living in an
emotional prison that I built myself.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.760
How about that? You abandoned us.

07:30.150 --> 07:34.870
I know, but get this: I'm not
just a prisoner. I'm the warden.

07:36.680 --> 07:41.860
We had to take t busus and walk a mile on
the pacific coast highway during rush hour.

07:41.870 --> 07:44.080
I get it. I understand.

07:44.090 --> 07:47.910
But the good news is, I hold
the keys to my own freedom.

07:48.790 --> 07:52.770
There's no sidewalk on
the pacific coast highway.

07:53.260 --> 07:55.350
Okay, okay. I hear ya.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.360
You're angry and resentful.

07:57.370 --> 08:01.030
But what you need to understand
is that resentment is the mortar

08:01.040 --> 08:06.050
that holds the bricks of loneliness
together in a wall of alienation and despair.

08:06.960 --> 08:10.310
Chapter 3: "Knocking down the wall."

08:11.210 --> 08:13.250
Bite me.

08:14.460 --> 08:18.900
That's chapter one in my
forthcoming book entitled, bite me.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.640
Chapter two is called,
"kiss my pale white ass."

08:24.690 --> 08:26.480
We can't go back to the mall.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.230
Why not?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.950
My shoes are missing.

08:32.140 --> 08:35.120
Huh, another mystery solved.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.210
Wrong foot, buddy.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.169
Oh, yeah, thanks.

08:42.679 --> 08:45.750
Guess I should be reading
taming of the shoe.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.110
Get it?

08:50.990 --> 08:54.640
You might want to start thinking
about having him neutered.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.770
Mmm, this is delicious.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.740
I've never had ethiopian food before.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.880
Mmm, I've loved it ever
since I lived in ethiopia.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.060
When did you live there?

09:10.070 --> 09:13.960
Let's see... it would have to be 1972.

09:14.460 --> 09:16.480
"1972"?

09:16.500 --> 09:18.620
Were you born there?

09:18.630 --> 09:19.670
Don't be silly.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.720
This was right after college.
I was in the peace corps.

09:24.350 --> 09:27.780
College.

09:27.790 --> 09:29.990
Need a pencil?

09:30.830 --> 09:32.700
N-n-no,
no, no, no.

09:32.710 --> 09:36.360
I was just thinking
what I was doing in 1972.

09:36.380 --> 09:38.740
Oh, tell me.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.530
Well, I don't have a vivid memory of it,

09:40.540 --> 09:44.920
but I'm pretty sure that's the year
I graduated to the big boy potty.

09:46.190 --> 09:48.690
So it's quite a year for both of us.

09:50.370 --> 09:52.900
So are you still using
that college degree?

09:52.930 --> 09:55.950
'Cause I'm still using
the big boy potty.

09:57.220 --> 10:00.560
You're used to going out with
younger women, aren't you?

10:00.570 --> 10:06.950
Well, I don't really think about age as much as I
think about personality and, you know, chemistry.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.790
And, uh, education, family values...

10:12.730 --> 10:15.820
all right, young and dumb, you got me.

10:17.130 --> 10:18.910
I'm not judging you, charlie.

10:18.930 --> 10:20.870
You're a man and you know what you want.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.080
What's wrong with that?

10:23.610 --> 10:25.310
Nothing?

10:25.320 --> 10:26.810
Nothing.

10:26.820 --> 10:30.140
You are fine just the way you are.

10:30.150 --> 10:31.290
I am?

10:31.300 --> 10:33.910
Of course you are.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.450
If I called my mother now,
would you tell her that?

10:39.110 --> 10:40.950
You don't think she knows?

10:40.960 --> 10:45.220
As far as she's concerned, the last
thing I did right was evacuate her uterus.

10:45.850 --> 10:48.740
Oh, you poor thing. That's awful.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.460
It is, isn't it?

10:50.480 --> 10:53.580
Every little boy needs to
feel loved and nurtured.

10:53.590 --> 10:58.020
Otherwise, he grows up with a hole
inside him that he can never fill.

10:58.030 --> 11:01.200
Oh, I have got such a big hole.

11:01.210 --> 11:03.900
If my hole could talk.

11:05.460 --> 11:07.750
You got a little something right here.

11:10.450 --> 11:12.240
I'll get it.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.560
- There we go.
- Thanks.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.370
You know what?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.390
I keke Y.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.610
I like you too, charlie.

11:27.910 --> 11:30.450
Try the yemiser kik wat.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.210
Looks kind of yucky.

11:33.220 --> 11:36.140
Well, don't look at it. Just taste it.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.830
Oh, come on. Just one bite. For me?

11:43.400 --> 11:45.400
Okay.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.690
Hey, it's good.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.380
I told you.

11:54.390 --> 11:57.460
Oh, excuse me. Could
I get another napkin?

12:01.930 --> 12:04.600
So, what do they have for dessert?

12:07.780 --> 12:10.920
Well, charlie, thank
you for a lovely evening.

12:10.940 --> 12:13.260
You're welcome.

12:15.620 --> 12:18.900
Can I, uh... kiss you good night?

12:18.910 --> 12:22.030
Do you usually ask permission?

12:22.040 --> 12:24.160
Well, no.

12:24.170 --> 12:26.730
Then why are you aing now?

12:26.740 --> 12:28.790
I don't know. I don'T...

12:28.800 --> 12:31.190
want to get in trouble.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.890
Okay, I'm in trouble.

12:44.020 --> 12:45.940
oh, I'm sorry. I thought
I heard something.

12:45.950 --> 12:47.580
It's okay. Jeremy, this is charlie.

12:47.590 --> 12:50.080
Charlie, this is my son jeremy.

12:50.090 --> 12:51.240
- How are you?
- Good. How's it going?

12:51.250 --> 12:51.850
Good.

12:51.860 --> 12:55.000
I didn't mean to interrupt. I just,
uh, dropped in to fix your computer.

12:55.010 --> 12:56.430
I'll leave you two ane.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.070
- Charlie, good meeting you.
- Same here.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.300
So, that's your son?

13:04.310 --> 13:06.710
- How old is he?
- 32

13:08.070 --> 13:10.400
They're cute at that age.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.074

13:29.110 --> 13:30.350
What?

13:30.370 --> 13:32.770
You're supposed to be
finishing your report.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.740
I know, but I can't find the book.

13:37.870 --> 13:40.280
You're kidding. We-we just bought it.

13:40.290 --> 13:41.650
What can I say, dad?

13:41.660 --> 13:44.380
It's a big house and a little book.

13:45.360 --> 13:48.290
Find the book.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.580
I'm really tired.

13:49.590 --> 13:53.100
Find the book!

13:53.390 --> 13:56.510
Just saying it won't make it happen.

13:57.770 --> 14:02.000
Find... the... book!

14:03.540 --> 14:06.050
Heads up. He's losing it.

14:06.060 --> 14:08.030
I should have put
frosting on the damn book.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.650
He's never lost anything
with frosting on it.

14:11.390 --> 14:14.190
I don't know why you continue to
bang your head against the wall.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.400
The kid's obviously destined to sell
tube socks out of the trunk of his car.

14:20.130 --> 14:22.490
A business of his own.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.790
Gee, that'd be swell.

14:26.850 --> 14:29.720
So, how was your date?

14:29.740 --> 14:30.860
Terrific.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.520
Then why are you home so early?

14:32.530 --> 14:35.250
Well, turns out she has a kid.

14:35.260 --> 14:37.090
Single mom, huh?

14:37.100 --> 14:39.170
Yeah.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.260
That's what she is: Single mom.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.080
- How old?
- 32

14:44.090 --> 14:46.380
- I meant the kid.
- So did I.

14:47.130 --> 14:50.930
You're kidding. If-if she's got a 32-year-old
kid, that would make her at least...

14:50.940 --> 14:52.870
don't do the math, please.

14:52.880 --> 14:55.440
It all goes south when you do the math.

14:55.670 --> 14:58.610
Oh, come on. So-so you're dating
an older woman. It's no big deal.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.960
That's it? You're t gonna
give me a hard time about it?

15:00.970 --> 15:03.870
Don't be silly. I'm
more evolved than that.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.210
Well, good.

15:06.570 --> 15:12.790
Just a gigolo everywhere I go
people know the part I'm playing...

15:14.390 --> 15:16.440
I guess I'm not.

15:17.310 --> 15:21.800
Look, this is a spectacular woman, and it
doesn't matter to me in the least how old she is.

15:21.810 --> 15:25.450
Oh, please. You can't even
tolerate age spots on a banana.

15:26.420 --> 15:32.540
Okay, first of all, on a banana, those
spots are an indication of mushiss.

15:32.550 --> 15:37.330
And second, I haven't
peeled this woman yet.

15:44.530 --> 15:46.930
In the freezer?

15:46.940 --> 15:48.080
Jake!

15:48.090 --> 15:52.670
Jake: I found it! I'm
reading! It's really cool.

16:05.820 --> 16:07.110
For god's sake.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.970
Hey, I was reading that!

16:08.980 --> 16:13.810
You're writing a report on the taming of
the shrew, not the voyages of cap'n crunch.

16:13.820 --> 16:16.410
Too bad. I could write
the crap out of that.

16:19.370 --> 16:21.400
Okay.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.880
I'm not fooling around here.

16:23.910 --> 16:27.940
You are going to finish this damn
book and write the damn report,

16:27.970 --> 16:32.890
and you are going to hand it in on monday,
spell-checked, formatted and on freakin' time.

16:34.020 --> 16:36.290
I have my doubts, dad.

16:38.210 --> 16:40.450
- Read!
- Fine.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.440
Listen to this. "A sleeve?"

16:46.450 --> 16:50.810
'Tis like a demi-cannon: What, up
and down, carved like an apple tart?"

16:50.820 --> 16:54.230
All I get from this is,
blah, blah, blah, apple tart.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.010
Have we got any apple tarts?

17:06.670 --> 17:07.550
Oh, good.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.640
I was afraid that first
kiss might have been a fluke.

17:10.650 --> 17:14.020
Well, I don't know about you,
but that was not my first kiss.

17:14.030 --> 17:16.000
Come on in.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.819
What a beautiful home.

17:19.140 --> 17:21.270
Thank you.

17:22.829 --> 17:25.690
How much of it do you want to see?

17:26.950 --> 17:30.180
Oh, this will be enough for today.

17:30.620 --> 17:32.490
Understood. Let's hit the road.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.480
Aren't you gonna take a jacket?

17:34.490 --> 17:35.760
Nah, I'm okay. I don't need one.

17:35.770 --> 17:38.410
Oh, it gets cool in
santa barbara, charlie.

17:38.420 --> 17:39.430
I'll be fine.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.320
Please. If you don't need it,
you can leave it in the car.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.440
All right.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.250
Take a look around.

17:47.260 --> 17:49.430
Mm, thanks, I will.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.480
Oh, hi. You, uh... you must be angie.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.850
I'm alan, charlie's brother.

17:54.860 --> 17:57.460
Oh, of course. Oh,
what a firm handshake.

17:57.470 --> 18:00.910
Well, uh, no one trusts a
chiropractor with limp hands.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.690
Oh, you're a chiropractor?

18:02.700 --> 18:04.980
Hey, hang on a second. I could
have gotten into medical school.

18:04.990 --> 18:07.960
I-I just didn't want to spend
four years in south america.

18:07.970 --> 18:10.390
No, no. I'm a big fan of chiropractics.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.750
You're kidding.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.410
No. I think you people
are miracle workers.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.740
Charlie: Okay. I'm ready to go.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.210
Did you put on sunblock?

18:19.220 --> 18:20.430
I don't need sunblock.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.450
Oh, honey, I think you do.

18:22.460 --> 18:25.510
You have beautiful skin, and I
don't want to see it get burned.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.810
You're right. Thanks.

18:28.340 --> 18:33.590
Uh, so, anyway, uh, you were saying
something about me being a miracle worker?

18:33.600 --> 18:36.360
Oh, god, yes. You know, I threw
my back out last year skiing.

18:36.370 --> 18:38.640
My chiropractor just
about saved my life.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.020
But that's what we do.

18:40.030 --> 18:41.770
You know, we-we're not flashy.

18:41.780 --> 18:46.220
We don't get, you know, ecial license plates
so we can park wherever the hell we want.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.670
You know, nobody makes
tv shows about us.

18:48.680 --> 18:53.470
Or calls us mcdreamy
or mcsteamy or mcmuffin.

18:55.390 --> 18:57.800
We just quietly go about
the business of healing.

18:57.810 --> 18:58.930
I know. I know.

18:58.940 --> 19:02.070
Thank you. Thank you. I only
wish more people appreciated us.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.190
Well, alan, you can't worry
about what other people think.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.850
I know, but the lack
of respect really hurts.

19:06.860 --> 19:10.310
You know, "back-cracker."
"Spine-cruncher." "Quack.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.160
" Uh, "charlatan." "Witch doctor..."

19:12.170 --> 19:14.710
- alan?
- "Voodoo priest." Fraud. Failure.

19:17.260 --> 19:19.420
You know what we call people
who say those kinds of things?

19:19.430 --> 19:21.580
My family?

19:21.590 --> 19:22.890
We call them damaged.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.490
They need to hurt others in order
to feel better about themselves.

19:25.510 --> 19:26.370
Exactly.

19:26.380 --> 19:28.280
And-and the only reason I
don't feel good about myself is

19:28.290 --> 19:30.990
that I'm not good enough
at hurting them back.

19:31.330 --> 19:33.410
Oh, no, you don't want to do that.

19:33.420 --> 19:35.550
Yeah, I kind of do.

19:35.560 --> 19:40.380
Alan, you need to ignore the
negativity and open yourself up

19:40.390 --> 19:43.370
to the nurturing love
that's all around you.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.630
Love is all around me?

19:44.640 --> 19:45.970
Yes.

19:45.980 --> 19:49.300
Is ihiding behind the
loathing and rejection?

19:49.720 --> 19:53.510
Honey, I am loving you right now.

19:53.520 --> 19:54.540
Really?

19:54.550 --> 19:57.010
Yes, really.

19:57.770 --> 19:59.880
Thank you.

20:03.300 --> 20:06.660
You are a wonderful,
valuable human being.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.720
I am?

20:08.730 --> 20:10.810
Yes, you are.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.720
I see you're getting to know my bther.

20:28.930 --> 20:31.170
******Iful country?

20:31.180 --> 20:33.840
Yeah. It's swell.

20:33.850 --> 20:37.710
Angie, if you like antiquing,
I know some great little shops.

20:38.060 --> 20:39.620
I'm not going antiquing.

20:39.630 --> 20:40.610
Oh, that's okay.

20:40.620 --> 20:43.770
Angie and i will peel off, and
you can sit in the park and drink.

20:45.050 --> 20:47.240
Are there any game
arcades in santa barbara?

20:47.250 --> 20:48.290
You won't have time.

20:48.300 --> 20:49.510
You have a book to read.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.120
Oh, yeah. I forgot it.

20:54.540 --> 20:56.460
That's okay. We can stop at a bookstore.

20:56.470 --> 20:58.930
Aw, gee, we don't want
to ruin your afternoon.

20:58.940 --> 21:00.440
Hey, we invited you.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.260
- We want you with us, right, charlie?
- No.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.060
Oh, don't be that way.

21:06.070 --> 21:09.320
I'll tell you what-- after we get jake's
book, we'll stop and get ice cream.

21:09.330 --> 21:10.670
Yes!
