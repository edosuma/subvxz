26:45.211 --> 26:46.640
I can't do this.

26:46.742 --> 26:48.010
I can't fucking do this.

26:49.116 --> 26:50.276
I feel it.

26:51.814 --> 26:52.814
What are you saying?

26:52.916 --> 26:53.984
You shouldn't be around me
right now.

26:54.086 --> 26:54.946
I--

26:55.048 --> 26:56.354
Fuck, I gotta get out of here.

26:56.457 --> 26:57.748
What? Hey! It's just--

26:57.850 --> 26:59.388
Hey!

26:59.490 --> 27:01.089
Don't you say that.

27:03.196 --> 27:03.961
It's okay.

27:04.063 --> 27:05.291
Hey.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.999
We're doing this.

27:11.434 --> 27:12.100
Okay?

27:15.871 --> 27:17.677
I don't want to fuck this up.

27:18.739 --> 27:20.178
You hearing me?

27:40.126 --> 27:44.603
Oh, just the man I need to see.

27:44.705 --> 27:47.636
Goddamn pothole playing hell,
am I right?

27:47.738 --> 27:49.739
Where are my tax dollars going?

27:49.841 --> 27:52.041
You paying taxes these days,
Elvis?

27:55.114 --> 27:57.710
You ain't got a side hustle for
fares, do you now?

27:57.812 --> 27:58.746
I'm Sheriff Church.

27:58.848 --> 28:00.216
Get your hands off my vehicle.

28:01.552 --> 28:04.350
Hey, no disrespect.

28:35.849 --> 28:37.815
Oh, shit!

28:38.686 --> 28:39.756
Fuck!

28:39.858 --> 28:42.157
Goddammit, you gave me
a heart attack.

28:43.327 --> 28:44.360
Huh?

28:45.329 --> 28:46.799
Hah!

28:48.202 --> 28:49.298
Guess what?

28:49.400 --> 28:50.060
What?

28:50.162 --> 28:52.370
The thrift shop hired me.

28:52.472 --> 28:53.238
Well, of course, they did.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.166
What'd I tell you?

28:54.268 --> 28:55.132
Yeah, well, it's only part time
for now.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.837
But they have the cutest stuff.

28:57.939 --> 29:01.275
And I got you a present.

29:07.452 --> 29:09.751
Oh, you hate it.

29:09.853 --> 29:10.617
No. No, no, I don't hate it.

29:10.719 --> 29:11.651
You hate it.

29:11.753 --> 29:13.791
Yes, you do.

29:13.893 --> 29:16.857
Gee, I don't think I've worn a
button-up

29:16.959 --> 29:18.556
since my fucking graduation.

29:20.830 --> 29:22.463
I like this one better.

29:22.565 --> 29:24.136
Yeah?

29:24.238 --> 29:25.365
You like it?

29:26.803 --> 29:28.701
Yeah, I like it a lot.

29:28.803 --> 29:30.106
Hey, thank you.

29:31.542 --> 29:32.938
You're welcome.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.211
I mean it, thank you.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.916
Well, I mean it, you're welcome.

29:39.286 --> 29:40.085
Guess what?

29:40.187 --> 29:40.715
What?

29:40.817 --> 29:41.848
Got you a present, too.

29:41.950 --> 29:43.155
-No, you didn't.
-I did.

29:43.257 --> 29:43.884
No, you didn't.

29:43.986 --> 29:44.551
I gotta take you to it though.

29:44.654 --> 29:45.356
No, you--

29:45.458 --> 29:46.559
Yes, I do.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.592
Oh, I gotta take you to the
present.

29:48.694 --> 29:50.591
It's all the way in the bedroom.

29:50.693 --> 29:51.957
I'm so sorry.

29:52.059 --> 29:52.890
I did, oh my goodness.

29:55.997 --> 29:57.434
You are so...

30:16.182 --> 30:18.754
Hey, I love you, Ruby Red.

30:18.856 --> 30:20.926
I love you more, Shelby John.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.519
Shelby, Ms. Red.

30:48.621 --> 30:49.949
Hey, Mike, how's it going?

30:50.051 --> 30:51.590
Goes right, I suppose.

30:51.692 --> 30:53.789
Like the whirl or like the
toilet?

30:53.891 --> 30:55.620
There is a perspective of it.

30:56.727 --> 30:57.888
It's like the whirl!

31:03.029 --> 31:08.039
Well, I have to admit, it's nice
to see your friends happy.

31:10.740 --> 31:11.710
We made it.

31:16.515 --> 31:17.983
Ruby Red.

31:19.353 --> 31:20.920
Hey, Peter.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.956
Hi, hey.

31:25.051 --> 31:25.687
Good to see you.

31:25.789 --> 31:26.754
Hey, Shelby John.

31:26.856 --> 31:28.491
How are you doing?

31:28.593 --> 31:30.527
Look at you two.

31:30.629 --> 31:32.526
Isn't it amazing?

31:32.628 --> 31:35.800
Now, your girl here, has even
been helping out at the church.

31:35.902 --> 31:38.537
We gonna see you there anytime
soon?

31:38.639 --> 31:40.669
I don't know, maybe. Maybe.

31:40.771 --> 31:41.701
-Yeah.
-Maybe.

31:41.803 --> 31:42.969
Yeah.

31:43.071 --> 31:44.343
Aunty Rubs.

31:44.445 --> 31:46.610
Oh my God, Conor.

31:46.712 --> 31:48.744
You're getting so big.

31:48.846 --> 31:50.274
You better stop growing.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.484
Hey look, we got you a present.

31:52.586 --> 31:53.345
Happy birthday.

31:53.447 --> 31:54.780
And I think you're gonna like
it.

31:54.882 --> 31:56.652
Thanks.

31:56.754 --> 31:57.850
Boy, what a hall.

31:57.952 --> 31:59.156
It's all you?

32:00.219 --> 32:02.857
Dar, are you decent?

32:02.959 --> 32:04.293
Only sometimes.

32:05.566 --> 32:07.429
Aw, you sound like mama.

32:07.531 --> 32:08.258
Oh.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.699
Mm, busy becoming a mama.

32:10.801 --> 32:12.169
Oh my, that's right.

32:12.271 --> 32:14.437
I forgot that ain't your little
tiny beer belly no more.

32:14.540 --> 32:15.405
Oh, stop.

32:17.675 --> 32:18.703
You're glowing.

32:25.612 --> 32:27.613
What you want with that thing,
little sis?

32:35.594 --> 32:37.493
For real?

32:37.595 --> 32:38.624
Yeah.

32:39.829 --> 32:42.768
Oh my God.

32:42.870 --> 32:44.803
Ah, maybe don't be
so mean about it,

32:44.905 --> 32:45.969
'cause he's saving up
for real one.

32:46.071 --> 32:47.504
And I kind of like this one
right now.

32:47.606 --> 32:49.207
So, you know.

32:49.309 --> 32:50.037
Oh.

32:50.139 --> 32:52.176
I'm happy for you, little girl.

32:54.843 --> 32:56.114
Yeah.

32:58.816 --> 33:00.316
So how you doing?

33:05.490 --> 33:08.051
I'm still sober, if that's what
you're asking me right now.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.792
Oh, girl.

33:09.894 --> 33:11.558
That's fucking great!

33:14.133 --> 33:17.333
Come on, you should be proud of
yourself.

33:19.836 --> 33:21.634
What, sweetie?

33:30.782 --> 33:32.615
I'm just so scared.

33:37.319 --> 33:39.891
We trust in your wisdom.

33:39.993 --> 33:42.826
And we look forward to
our boy Conor

33:42.928 --> 33:44.525
getting washed in the blood.

33:45.597 --> 33:46.830
Amen.

33:46.932 --> 33:48.331
EVERYONE
Amen.

33:50.737 --> 33:51.567
Aren't you gonna have any?

33:52.733 --> 33:56.735
Mama, I think Ruby has something
to tell y'all.

33:58.712 --> 34:00.442
Is that right, Darda?

34:03.279 --> 34:08.816
Oh well, we were thinking
about--

34:08.918 --> 34:10.122
Getting hitched.

34:11.185 --> 34:12.724
Hey, how about that?

34:12.826 --> 34:15.452
Well, congratulations, you two.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.056
Shelby John, you're a lucky man.

34:18.158 --> 34:19.659
Yeah, I know.

34:21.064 --> 34:22.827
You didn't even ask me.

34:29.836 --> 34:33.578
Lord knows we've had our share
of differences.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.873
But Ruby is my baby.

34:37.713 --> 34:41.648
You didn't think to ask my
permission to take her hand?

34:43.917 --> 34:46.255
To be honest, since her daddy's
out the picture,

34:46.357 --> 34:49.491
I-- I didn't think about asking
permission.

34:52.432 --> 34:56.861
But I can see now that was sort
of sexist, like on my part.

34:58.371 --> 35:03.004
That baby girl has broke my
heart more than once.

35:03.106 --> 35:06.943
Ain't gonna lie about that now
just 'cause she's gone clean a
couple of weeks.

35:07.045 --> 35:08.647
Clean about over a month, mama.

35:08.749 --> 35:10.908
Mama's talking, Darda.

35:18.925 --> 35:20.289
Greta, with all due respect,

35:20.391 --> 35:22.491
I'm marrying your daughter no
matter what.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.396
What I can do is I--

35:27.730 --> 35:30.466
I can swear to take care of her
till my dying breath.

35:32.272 --> 35:34.734
I suppose what I'm asking for is
a little faith.

35:38.340 --> 35:43.248
Faith is something I do have.

35:47.813 --> 35:51.421
Don't you let me down, Shelby
John.

35:53.087 --> 35:54.391
I won't.

35:57.290 --> 36:01.130
Here I was listening, this fine
day cannot get any sweeter,

36:01.232 --> 36:03.600
but I do love to be proven
wrong.

36:04.998 --> 36:07.898
Because being proven wrong keeps
us humble.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.211
Just, life is filled with trials
and tribulations.

36:12.943 --> 36:14.874
We all struggle.

36:14.976 --> 36:19.279
But it is the way we confront
those struggles that defines us.

36:19.381 --> 36:23.519
So, this to the happy couple.

36:24.619 --> 36:27.523
Welcome to the family,
Shelby John.

36:33.661 --> 36:35.698
Pain in the ass,
don't get me started.

36:35.800 --> 36:36.562
Yeah.

36:36.664 --> 36:38.501
You should come work for me.

36:39.534 --> 36:42.304
It's a good wage, health
insurance.

36:42.406 --> 36:44.769
If Ruby is anything like her
sister,

36:44.871 --> 36:47.609
she's not gonna wait too long to
have a baby.

36:49.811 --> 36:51.046
Hey, you don't have to answer
now.

36:51.148 --> 36:52.750
Just put it back here.

36:52.852 --> 36:53.978
I will, thank you.

36:55.186 --> 36:57.184
I scored us some extra cake.

36:57.286 --> 36:58.950
Can't leave without this.

36:59.990 --> 37:01.392
Take it, girl.

37:03.094 --> 37:05.026
Oh my God, are you sure?

37:05.128 --> 37:06.127
Of course, I'm sure.

37:06.229 --> 37:07.299
Go and get it fitted.

37:08.229 --> 37:09.664
Oh.

37:17.744 --> 37:18.610
Do you like it?

37:18.712 --> 37:19.971
It's beautiful.

37:27.083 --> 37:28.280
Thank you.

37:28.382 --> 37:29.585
Thanks.

37:31.890 --> 37:33.216
See you later.

37:33.318 --> 37:34.858
Bye.

37:49.969 --> 37:52.344
Alright, let's make it a
special.

37:53.408 --> 37:54.709
Fellas, can I get like?

37:56.046 --> 37:56.746

I got nothing planned.
How about yourself?

40:13.747 --> 40:14.513
I don't know, man.

40:14.615 --> 40:15.614
Getting hit with the lady.

40:15.716 --> 40:16.648
Popping the great question?

40:16.750 --> 40:18.317
Oh, maybe it already happened.

40:18.419 --> 40:19.020
Oh, really?

40:20.025 --> 40:21.288
Alright, yeah!

40:45.986 --> 40:46.947
We cool, ain't we?

40:50.255 --> 40:51.556
I guess we ain't cool.

40:54.561 --> 40:57.357
You gotta chill out once in a
while, soldier.

40:57.459 --> 40:58.662
War is over for you.

41:00.094 --> 41:03.001
I just came by to check up on my
old pal Ruby Red.

41:03.103 --> 41:03.995
Get the fuck out of here

41:04.097 --> 41:06.169
before I knock your teeth down
your throat.

41:06.271 --> 41:07.939
There he is.

41:08.041 --> 41:09.871
Our wild Mustang.

41:11.741 --> 41:13.539
Been a minute
since I've seen him.

41:34.167 --> 41:35.960
What's up, girl?

41:36.062 --> 41:37.866
Just paying a visit
to your old man.

41:39.203 --> 41:40.000
Oh, yeah?

41:41.267 --> 41:42.937
Called me up for a little
special delivery.

41:48.014 --> 41:48.910
Are you serious?

41:50.512 --> 41:52.716
What's the matter?

41:52.818 --> 41:55.312
You know, last thing I wanna do
is get between you two.

41:56.655 --> 41:58.755
Yeah, well, you didn't do
anything wrong.

42:02.795 --> 42:05.157
Don't tell him I told you he's
been using, will you?

42:07.894 --> 42:09.601
Kicking it ain't an easy thing.

42:12.269 --> 42:13.198
Don't I know it?

42:17.505 --> 42:20.612
Hey, here.

42:25.684 --> 42:28.613
Say why should Shelby John have
all the fun?

42:49.703 --> 42:51.940
Baby, hey.

42:54.313 --> 42:56.142
Didn't hear you come in.

43:05.554 --> 43:06.790
Baptism tomorrow.

43:07.788 --> 43:09.287
Yeah, I know. You excited?

43:10.760 --> 43:12.257
What if I'm just not good
enough?

43:15.361 --> 43:16.932
If you ain't good enough to be
saved, nobody is.

43:18.367 --> 43:19.132
Come on.

43:24.036 --> 43:25.740
Let me put some clothes on.

43:25.842 --> 43:27.239
I'll make you something to eat,
alright?

44:51.557 --> 44:54.662
Okay, baby, before you say
anything I'm not done yet.

44:54.764 --> 44:56.197
I started to sand the floors.

44:56.299 --> 44:58.264
Took out all the bars, and gave
them a first coat, right?

44:59.672 --> 45:01.498
And the yard took me about four
hours.

45:05.111 --> 45:06.041
Ruby?

45:09.215 --> 45:10.144
Hey, Ruby?

45:11.249 --> 45:12.577
Ruby?

45:12.680 --> 45:13.645
Hey, Ruby?

45:13.747 --> 45:15.316
Hey, hey, hey.

45:15.419 --> 45:16.849
Oh, baby.

45:16.951 --> 45:18.383
Baby, hey, come on, wake up.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.089
Oh, fuck.

45:23.690 --> 45:24.427
Oh, f--

45:24.529 --> 45:25.493
Ruby, hey, hey, baby.

45:25.595 --> 45:26.529
Come on, wake up.

45:26.631 --> 45:27.891
Baby, wake up for me, come on.

45:27.993 --> 45:28.893
Hey, Ruby, come on.

45:28.995 --> 45:30.260
Come on, baby. Come on.

45:30.362 --> 45:31.803
Come on, baby. Come on, come on,
come on.

45:32.502 --> 45:33.499
Oh, shit.

45:33.602 --> 45:34.438
Oh, fuck.

45:34.540 --> 45:35.500
Oh, baby, what have you done?

45:35.602 --> 45:36.271
Oh!

45:36.374 --> 45:37.238
Oh, fuck!

45:37.340 --> 45:38.340
No.

45:38.442 --> 45:39.507
Oh, no, no, no.

45:39.609 --> 45:40.409
Don't do this, baby.

45:40.511 --> 45:41.945

50:27.967 --> 50:31.166
When you're remembered, dreamt
about.

50:31.269 --> 50:32.664
Looks like a fallen angel.

50:34.304 --> 50:36.269
I just saw her last week on
Shelby's bike.

50:36.371 --> 50:38.508
She looked happy, they looked
happy.

50:38.610 --> 50:40.545
It wasn't him.

50:40.647 --> 50:42.212
She did this herself.

50:43.579 --> 50:46.345
My guess is Shelby John ain't
gonna be easy to find.

50:46.447 --> 50:49.183
He was always a wild one,
Shelby John.

50:49.285 --> 50:50.885
My boy Mickey
played ball with him.

50:50.987 --> 50:52.916
Called him "Mustang".

50:53.018 --> 50:56.323
Fast as a horse on the fuel,
wild and dangerous off him.

50:56.425 --> 50:57.694
So this Mustang can kick.

50:57.796 --> 50:59.160
Oh, he can kick alright

50:59.262 --> 51:01.231
but he won't screw with his
burbon.

51:02.131 --> 51:04.163
He didn't start that fight.

51:04.266 --> 51:06.003
I'm sure as hell
he'll finish it.

51:06.105 --> 51:08.132
Or maybe it's not too late for
Shelby John.

51:08.234 --> 51:09.236
It's gotta be me.

51:09.338 --> 51:11.639
If anybody else gets to him
first--

51:11.741 --> 51:12.941
Sheriff.

51:29.455 --> 51:31.393
They were fixing the place up.

51:36.466 --> 51:38.862
Shelby John's problem
is knowing when to stop.

51:43.706 --> 51:46.642
If you find him, you stay calm
and tell him I just wanna talk.

51:46.744 --> 51:47.611
That's all.

51:47.713 --> 51:48.872
You got it, boss.

51:57.953 --> 51:59.188
Who is it?

51:59.291 --> 52:01.588
Friend of your dad's.
Go get him.

52:01.690 --> 52:04.557
If you're a friend, you know not
to come here for drug.

52:04.659 --> 52:06.026
Get your daddy, or I'm gonna
kick down

52:06.128 --> 52:07.729
this whole goddamn wall.

52:07.831 --> 52:08.830
Whatever, dude.

52:08.932 --> 52:10.366
It's your funeral.

52:12.938 --> 52:14.733
Dad, some fucker's at the door.

52:20.208 --> 52:21.677
I'll take care of this.

52:23.815 --> 52:24.809
Who is it?

52:26.116 --> 52:27.749
Hey, move your hand, asshole.

52:31.451 --> 52:32.520
Fuck, man. Shelby?

52:33.891 --> 52:36.260
Stay the fuck down.

52:36.362 --> 52:37.825
Shelby, whatever he done, I'm
sure it was a mistake.

52:37.927 --> 52:38.829
He didn't mean--

52:38.931 --> 52:40.726
Take your kids fuck out of here.

52:42.968 --> 52:44.162
You wanna stay or you wanna go?

52:44.264 --> 52:45.703
I'll go, I'll go.

52:45.805 --> 52:47.033
I'm sorry, baby.

53:13.465 --> 53:16.031
I fucking told you, and I told
you again we were clean.

53:16.133 --> 53:17.262
I won't give Ruby nothing else.

53:17.364 --> 53:19.132
I'll-- I'll stay away.

53:19.234 --> 53:20.703
Don't even gotta pay me.

53:20.805 --> 53:21.899
She's dead.

53:24.205 --> 53:25.138
Fuck!

53:25.240 --> 53:26.711
I'm so sorry, Shelby.

53:26.813 --> 53:27.839
You gotta understand,

53:27.941 --> 53:29.709
I've been getting squeezed to
bring my numbers up.

53:35.953 --> 53:36.947
What'd you give her?

53:38.219 --> 53:39.785
Just a little smack.

53:40.893 --> 53:42.990
She got Smack, what else?

53:43.092 --> 53:44.295
That's--that's it.

53:48.165 --> 53:49.864
I said what else?

53:49.966 --> 53:52.201
I had to cut it.

53:52.303 --> 53:53.562
I told you, I've been getting
squeezed

53:53.664 --> 53:54.833
like you wouldn't believe.

53:56.271 --> 53:57.440
Who is your supplier?

53:58.303 --> 53:59.836
What?

53:59.938 --> 54:01.439
Give me his name and maybe I'll
leave here

54:01.541 --> 54:02.945
while you're still breathing.

54:03.047 --> 54:04.007
I can't give you that.

54:08.185 --> 54:09.982
Please don't fucking kill me.

54:11.157 --> 54:13.388
Please don't fucking kill me,
man.

54:13.490 --> 54:15.458
I'm gonna ask you one more
fucking time.

54:17.026 --> 54:17.955
Your supplier?

54:19.265 --> 54:20.757
I don't know where that shit
comes from.

54:20.859 --> 54:22.558
I'll fucking kill you
like cattle.

54:22.660 --> 54:23.733
I don't fucking know, man.

54:23.835 --> 54:24.327
I swear I don't.

54:24.429 --> 54:25.699
Okay, okay.

54:27.234 --> 54:28.968
Darius. Darius!

54:29.070 --> 54:29.906
Address?

54:30.008 --> 54:31.170
I don't fucking know.

54:31.272 --> 54:32.643
Okay, okay, okay.

54:32.745 --> 54:34.310
Okay, okay.

54:34.413 --> 54:36.276
I pick up my gear in Columbus,
The Brown hotel.

54:36.378 --> 54:37.210
Different room every night.

54:37.312 --> 54:38.245
That's all I know, man.

54:38.347 --> 54:40.081
Please, fucking come on, man.

54:40.183 --> 54:41.883
You've seen my family.

54:41.985 --> 54:43.420
Just please...

54:45.222 --> 54:46.621
They're better off without you.

54:47.793 --> 54:48.956
Everybody is.

55:32.438 --> 55:34.037
DISPATCH OFFICER 1
Four shots fired.

55:34.139 --> 55:36.434
Past of 187 on Freedom drive.

55:36.536 --> 55:39.036
Two black and white--

55:39.138 --> 55:42.308
Suspect's armed and can be seen
on a black motorcycle.

55:42.410 --> 55:43.940
Headed northbound on 185.

55:44.043 --> 55:49.219
I repeat, suspect's armed headed
north on 1I-85.

56:10.737 --> 56:12.303
I just can't the fuck.

56:12.405 --> 56:13.910
I can't, fuck.

56:31.455 --> 56:33.325
Oh!

56:45.273 --> 56:46.609
Hi there.

56:51.050 --> 56:52.175
Where did you come from?

56:55.517 --> 56:57.782
You got your mama over there?

56:57.884 --> 56:59.886
Think you better go back to your
mama.

57:04.057 --> 57:06.261
Jesus Christ died for our sins.

57:06.363 --> 57:08.529
Elvis Kincaid died for his own.

57:08.631 --> 57:11.062
Nailed straight through the
forehead.

57:13.030 --> 57:15.506
Church, you questioned the
family?

57:16.842 --> 57:18.036
Church?

57:19.438 --> 57:20.137
Church?

57:21.276 --> 57:23.679
Yeah, I got it.

57:25.383 --> 57:26.248
Oh, come on, Sheriff.

57:26.350 --> 57:27.649
How long we're gonna be here?

57:27.751 --> 57:29.248
We've already been through
enough tonight already.

57:29.350 --> 57:30.553
I know it, Jess.

57:30.655 --> 57:31.848
But I wouldn't be asking if it
wasn't important.

57:31.950 --> 57:33.783
I just want to talk to the
oldest.

57:33.885 --> 57:35.388
Well, that's Travis.

57:35.490 --> 57:37.259
Travis it is.

57:37.361 --> 57:38.356
Alright, only with me present.

57:38.458 --> 57:40.163
Right, let's go.

57:40.265 --> 57:42.228
You're on babysitting duty.

57:42.330 --> 57:44.001
The hell I am.

57:44.103 --> 57:45.064
How old are you?

57:45.166 --> 57:46.264
11.

57:46.366 --> 57:47.066
How old?

57:47.168 --> 57:48.165
11.

57:50.775 --> 57:53.370
You know, my son used to play
football with your dad.

57:53.472 --> 57:55.109
Really?

57:55.211 --> 57:56.039
Was he any good?

57:56.141 --> 57:58.113
Yeah, your dad held his own on
the line.

57:58.215 --> 57:58.980
He had a good team.

57:59.083 --> 58:00.243
Damn good.

58:01.653 --> 58:03.415
You know what your old man did
for a living?

58:03.517 --> 58:05.487
Umm...

58:05.589 --> 58:07.022
Don't look to your mama now.

58:07.124 --> 58:08.724
Now, come on.

58:08.826 --> 58:12.195
Well, my friends used to say my
dad was the best dad.

58:12.297 --> 58:14.858
Like, taking care of people.

58:14.960 --> 58:17.033
Taking care of people how?

58:17.135 --> 58:18.802
Like, with medicine.

58:18.904 --> 58:19.531
Travis?

58:19.633 --> 58:21.199
No, shut your mouth, Jess.

58:21.301 --> 58:24.069
Or we all spend the rest of the
night in interrogation room.

58:25.478 --> 58:27.270
You know where you dad keeps his
medicine?

58:29.114 --> 58:30.981
Travis, look at me.

58:31.083 --> 58:32.178
I don't know, sir.

58:32.281 --> 58:33.782
I'm sorry.

59:11.719 --> 59:13.791
Watch it. What the fuck, man?

59:13.893 --> 59:15.153
Asshole.

59:17.427 --> 59:19.228
Excuse me, can I help you?

59:19.330 --> 59:20.924
I've come to see a friend.

59:21.026 --> 59:22.461
I see. Enjoy, sir.

1:00:39.542 --> 1:00:40.777
Hey, how you guys doing?

1:00:41.841 --> 1:00:42.873
How you doing, Mister?

1:00:42.976 --> 1:00:44.275
I'm doing pretty good.

1:00:45.382 --> 1:00:46.950
You guys partying?

1:00:47.053 --> 1:00:48.618
Oh, shit.

1:00:48.721 --> 1:00:50.550
You know where I can buy me some
of them pills?

1:00:50.652 --> 1:00:52.888
We got no pills, officer.

1:00:56.690 --> 1:00:57.755
Can you not do that?

1:00:57.857 --> 1:00:59.258
My fucking nose, man.

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:00.022
Hey.

1:01:00.124 --> 1:01:01.859
Let Kenny go. Please, Mister.

1:01:01.961 --> 1:01:02.760
He didn't mean nothing by it.

1:01:02.862 --> 1:01:04.228
I asked him a question.

1:01:04.330 --> 1:01:05.596
Our friend Skeeter, he gets the
pills from someone

1:01:05.698 --> 1:01:06.499
down the hall.

1:01:06.601 --> 1:01:07.738
Oh yeah?

1:01:08.535 --> 1:01:09.336
Skeeter?

1:01:09.438 --> 1:01:10.139
Which room?

1:01:10.241 --> 1:01:10.874
Don't tell him.

1:01:10.976 --> 1:01:12.437
Hey.

1:01:12.539 --> 1:01:14.107
1507.

1:01:15.576 --> 1:01:17.608
1507. Thank you.

1:01:17.710 --> 1:01:19.079
Thanks, Kenny.

1:01:22.452 --> 1:01:24.216
Ah, that's right.

1:01:26.790 --> 1:01:31.124
Oxycodone, D-- Demerol.

1:01:32.023 --> 1:01:33.490
It's a form of fentanyl.

1:01:33.592 --> 1:01:37.130
No doubt that Kincaid was
putting this into his heroin.

1:01:37.232 --> 1:01:40.466
This little brick has left a
whole lot of searching

1:01:40.568 --> 1:01:41.937
in its wake.

1:01:46.343 --> 1:01:47.837
Who that?

1:01:47.939 --> 1:01:49.241
Kenny.

1:01:50.508 --> 1:01:53.850
Oh, do you need some more shit,
huh, college boy?

1:01:58.518 --> 1:01:59.288
Ah!

1:01:59.390 --> 1:01:59.949
Oh my God.

1:02:00.051 --> 1:02:01.221
Fucking hell.

1:02:01.323 --> 1:02:01.785
Hey.

1:02:01.887 --> 1:02:04.126
Ah! Ah!

1:02:04.229 --> 1:02:05.359
Fuck, ah!

1:02:05.461 --> 1:02:05.954
Jesus, fuck.

1:02:06.056 --> 1:02:06.757
Stay down.

1:02:06.859 --> 1:02:08.161
Alright, stay down!

1:02:08.263 --> 1:02:09.794
You can suck my dick, you
fucking bitch-ass.

1:02:09.896 --> 1:02:11.797
No, I'm good. Tell him.

1:02:11.899 --> 1:02:13.837
Man said stay down, Skeeter.

1:02:14.999 --> 1:02:16.840
Time to go, ladies.

1:02:23.315 --> 1:02:24.443
So that's Skeeter.

1:02:24.545 --> 1:02:25.475
You are?

1:02:26.547 --> 1:02:27.545
Darius.

1:02:27.647 --> 1:02:29.013
Darius.

1:02:29.115 --> 1:02:30.854
You can call me, "the Kin
killer".

1:02:32.182 --> 1:02:34.891
Oh, just heard about that.

1:02:36.561 --> 1:02:38.461
Kincaid was a piece of shit.

1:02:38.563 --> 1:02:40.393
But the man did have a family.

1:02:40.496 --> 1:02:41.491
You know?

1:02:42.563 --> 1:02:43.793
I don't.

1:02:43.895 --> 1:02:45.594
Not anymore.

1:02:45.696 --> 1:02:48.637
Not since you were leaning on
Kincaid to sell more.

1:02:48.739 --> 1:02:50.668
I'm getting leaned on too,
brother.

1:02:50.770 --> 1:02:51.570
Believe me.

1:02:51.672 --> 1:02:52.841
You want money?

1:02:52.944 --> 1:02:55.272
There's 10 grand right there in
front of you.

1:02:55.374 --> 1:02:57.240
I got no need for money where
I'm going.

1:02:57.342 --> 1:02:58.677
You got that right,
motherfucker.

1:02:58.779 --> 1:03:00.411
Just shut up, man.

1:03:06.953 --> 1:03:08.584
You after my supplier?

1:03:10.060 --> 1:03:11.821
I don't give a fuck. I'll give
you his name.

1:03:11.923 --> 1:03:12.690
You let me walk.

1:03:12.792 --> 1:03:13.628
Fuck, Darius.

1:03:13.730 --> 1:03:14.957
You wanna get us both gutted?

1:03:15.059 --> 1:03:16.660
Coyote is fucking--

1:03:16.763 --> 1:03:19.267
Ah! Fuck.

1:03:21.404 --> 1:03:22.705
Coyote?

1:03:22.807 --> 1:03:24.074
That's what he calls himself.

1:03:24.176 --> 1:03:25.467
Yeah.

1:03:25.569 --> 1:03:28.208
And I know something he don't
know I know.

1:03:29.314 --> 1:03:30.675
Where he lives.

1:03:30.777 --> 1:03:32.008
Y'all dead.

1:03:32.110 --> 1:03:33.076
Y'all both fucking dead.

1:03:33.178 --> 1:03:34.648
Just watch your mouth, boy.

1:03:34.750 --> 1:03:36.546
The grown-ups is talking.

1:03:43.126 --> 1:03:47.761
That girl on the news they
saying you killed.

1:03:47.863 --> 1:03:49.597
That's what they're saying, huh?

1:03:49.699 --> 1:03:51.066
That's what this is about?

1:03:52.166 --> 1:03:53.968
Your dumb bitch
can't handle her shit.

1:03:54.070 --> 1:03:55.668
So you come around here swinging
your dick

1:03:55.770 --> 1:03:57.274
like a fucking punk?

1:03:59.709 --> 1:04:02.143
That shit pathetic, dog.

1:04:06.484 --> 1:04:07.610
Fuck.

1:04:08.751 --> 1:04:12.287
Oh God, motherfucker!

1:04:12.389 --> 1:04:13.050
Fuck!

1:04:13.152 --> 1:04:15.654
Man, I'm sorry about your girl.

1:04:15.756 --> 1:04:17.087
I truly am.

1:04:17.189 --> 1:04:19.927
But I didn't even know her.

1:04:20.029 --> 1:04:21.525
That's what make it worse,
isn't it?

1:04:23.228 --> 1:04:25.027
It didn't matter to Kincaid.

1:04:25.129 --> 1:04:26.398
Don't matter to you.

1:04:27.765 --> 1:04:30.836
Don't matter to some dumb fuck
calls himself "Coyote".

1:04:30.938 --> 1:04:32.707
So where does he live?

1:04:32.809 --> 1:04:34.937
Don't tell him shit, Darius.

1:04:35.039 --> 1:04:35.640
Don't say--

1:04:37.912 --> 1:04:40.446
Fuck! You motherfucker!

1:04:40.548 --> 1:04:43.820
He's got a big old fucked up
house out in Quinton county

1:04:43.923 --> 1:04:46.615
off a Tea Lake Road right next
to Floyd's Fork.

1:04:46.717 --> 1:04:48.688
Took me hunting there once with
his weird-ass crew

1:04:48.790 --> 1:04:49.789
to intimidate me.

1:04:49.891 --> 1:04:51.390
You believe that shit?

1:04:51.989 --> 1:04:53.626
Did he?

1:04:53.728 --> 1:04:54.624
Did he what?

1:04:55.730 --> 1:04:57.264
Intimidate you?

1:04:59.831 --> 1:05:04.139
Honest, ain't nobody in my life
ever scared me like that dude.

1:05:08.239 --> 1:05:10.277
Don't leave him breathing.

1:05:36.402 --> 1:05:38.239
I may come back here one day.

1:05:40.707 --> 1:05:44.982

Let me just rest my eyes while I

1:06:44.037 --> 1:06:45.806
I'm just an old man.

1:07:22.741 --> 1:07:24.273
Hold on, you can talk to him at
the hospital.

1:07:24.375 --> 1:07:25.175
I'll talk to him here.

1:07:25.277 --> 1:07:26.144
No, you're not hearing me.

1:07:26.246 --> 1:07:27.143
No, you're not hearing me, son.

1:07:27.245 --> 1:07:28.047
I'm talking to him.

1:07:28.149 --> 1:07:29.315
Excuse us.

1:07:29.418 --> 1:07:31.213
His manners can sometimes get
away from him

1:07:31.315 --> 1:07:32.716
this late at night.

1:07:37.127 --> 1:07:38.623
Do you know the man done this to
you?

1:07:40.057 --> 1:07:40.860
Huh?

1:07:40.962 --> 1:07:42.125
I ain't saying shit.

1:07:42.227 --> 1:07:42.960
I know my rights.

1:07:43.062 --> 1:07:43.931
Do you now?

1:07:44.033 --> 1:07:45.597
Sound like you're on a TV show.

1:07:46.738 --> 1:07:48.605
That must hurt some awful.

1:07:48.707 --> 1:07:49.505
Got some painkillers?

1:07:49.607 --> 1:07:51.608
Some good shit?

1:07:51.710 --> 1:07:52.835
Fuck out of here, man.

1:07:54.106 --> 1:07:56.543
Ah, fuck!

1:07:56.645 --> 1:07:57.739
Ah!

1:07:57.842 --> 1:08:00.075
Maybe they didn't give you good
shit after all.

1:08:00.178 --> 1:08:01.547
Oh, fuck.

1:08:01.649 --> 1:08:03.453
If he left you alive, you must
have told him something.

1:08:03.555 --> 1:08:04.181
What was it?

1:08:04.283 --> 1:08:06.752
I didn't say nothing, man.

1:08:06.854 --> 1:08:08.191
Come on.

1:08:08.293 --> 1:08:09.857
If he left you alive, you must
have told him something.

1:08:09.959 --> 1:08:10.889
I didn't say nothing.

1:08:10.991 --> 1:08:11.727
So what was it?

1:08:11.829 --> 1:08:13.191
I didn't say nothing!

1:08:13.293 --> 1:08:14.595
I didn't say fucking nothing!

1:08:14.697 --> 1:08:15.862
Stop!

1:08:15.964 --> 1:08:17.159
Stop, please, stop!

1:08:17.261 --> 1:08:18.063
What was it?

1:08:18.165 --> 1:08:19.163
Stop, please just stop!

1:08:19.265 --> 1:08:20.164
I'm not gonna let go.

1:08:20.266 --> 1:08:21.635
You tell me what it was.

1:08:21.737 --> 1:08:23.402
Fuck.

1:08:23.504 --> 1:08:25.135
You think this is piece of your
knee cap?

1:08:26.408 --> 1:08:26.970
You think this is piece of your
knee cap?

1:08:27.073 --> 1:08:28.576
Ah, fuck!

1:08:28.679 --> 1:08:29.678
Huh? Okay.

1:08:29.780 --> 1:08:31.912
Okay, okay, okay.

1:08:32.014 --> 1:08:32.911
I didn't say nothing, man.

1:08:33.013 --> 1:08:34.049
I swear it.

1:08:34.151 --> 1:08:35.917
It was fucking Darius told him,
okay?

1:08:36.019 --> 1:08:37.951
Now what did Darius tell him?

1:08:38.053 --> 1:08:39.884
What'd Darius tell him?

1:08:39.987 --> 1:08:41.523
Fuck man!

1:08:45.026 --> 1:08:46.592
Fuck!

1:08:59.570 --> 1:09:00.675
You alright?

1:09:00.777 --> 1:09:02.740
Was it a deer?

1:09:35.645 --> 1:09:38.281
You wanna tell me what's going
on, Sheriff?

1:09:45.919 --> 1:09:47.290
I--

1:09:48.593 --> 1:09:49.985
I saw--

1:09:52.562 --> 1:09:55.661
It may have been a few years
since it happened last.

1:09:59.304 --> 1:10:02.167
I didn't see him how he was when
he died.

1:10:02.269 --> 1:10:03.606
You know, grown and all.

1:10:03.708 --> 1:10:06.104
I see making--

1:10:06.206 --> 1:10:07.071
I see my little boy.

1:10:07.173 --> 1:10:08.443
I see him--

1:10:09.841 --> 1:10:14.350
I see him as my little-- my
little boy.

1:10:24.426 --> 1:10:27.858
I missed my-- my chance to save
him.

1:10:32.398 --> 1:10:34.271
I seen my sister once.

1:10:35.270 --> 1:10:38.140
She said that life is a river

1:10:38.242 --> 1:10:40.938
that eventually spills into the
ocean.

1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:45.315
And when you get to the delta
where the river meets the sea,

1:10:45.417 --> 1:10:48.311
that's where your loved ones
will be waiting for you.

1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:57.892
Well, maybe it's not too late
for Shelby John.

1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:39.495
How many more? Let's go.

1:11:39.597 --> 1:11:40.936
What's taking so long?

1:11:41.038 --> 1:11:42.430
Load it up, load it up.

1:11:42.532 --> 1:11:43.335
We gotta move.

1:11:43.437 --> 1:11:45.336
Boss wants us out the door.

1:11:45.438 --> 1:11:46.673
Go grab mine.

1:11:53.013 --> 1:11:54.417
You.

1:11:56.282 --> 1:11:57.085
Hey, hey.

1:11:57.187 --> 1:11:58.414
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy, man.

1:11:58.516 --> 1:11:59.485
Shut up.

1:11:59.587 --> 1:12:00.852
Come on, bro, what happened?

1:12:02.761 --> 1:12:04.992
Easy, easy.

1:12:05.094 --> 1:12:06.288
Okay, okay, okay.

1:12:06.390 --> 1:12:07.894
No, no.

1:12:07.996 --> 1:12:09.260
No, man.

1:12:17.107 --> 1:12:18.639
Clean this shit up, man.

1:12:28.119 --> 1:12:28.883
Let's go, gentlemen.

1:12:28.985 --> 1:12:29.885
Load it up.

1:12:29.987 --> 1:12:30.613
Come on, let's go.

1:12:30.715 --> 1:12:32.389
Boss wants us out of the door.

1:12:33.321 --> 1:12:34.188
We're good.

1:12:34.291 --> 1:12:35.388
Alright man, hurry up.

1:12:35.490 --> 1:12:38.125
Take the back roads, don't

1:12:38.227 --> 1:12:39.422
Back roads, huh?

1:13:01.853 --> 1:13:03.413
Go, go, go, go.

1:13:17.234 --> 1:13:18.868
Yo, what the fuck was that?

1:14:16.627 --> 1:14:19.095
In what I've seen over the years
of hell,

1:14:19.197 --> 1:14:20.891
just over the past 24 hours,

1:14:20.994 --> 1:14:23.893
this beast is more complex than
we ever thought.

1:14:23.995 --> 1:14:25.729
Every time we cut off one
tentacle,

1:14:25.831 --> 1:14:27.735
another one sneaks
up in its place.

1:18:14.226 --> 1:18:15.924
How the hell you know that?

1:18:16.026 --> 1:18:17.797
Shelby knows this land.

1:18:17.899 --> 1:18:19.597
You stay here, secure the
perimeter.

1:19:17.027 --> 1:19:18.391
I guess nobody's coming to save
your ass.

1:19:18.493 --> 1:19:19.554
Get the fuck...

1:19:22.795 --> 1:19:24.097
Give me the phone.

1:19:25.534 --> 1:19:27.399
What's the passcode?

1:19:27.502 --> 1:19:29.335
Passcode?

1:19:29.438 --> 1:19:30.532
Fuck you.

1:19:34.641 --> 1:19:36.043
Open wide.

1:19:37.742 --> 1:19:40.949
9-1-7-3.

1:20:04.740 --> 1:20:06.139
What the fuck is this about?

1:20:07.478 --> 1:20:08.509
I don't know.

1:20:08.611 --> 1:20:10.275
Wrong number, my bad.

1:20:11.879 --> 1:20:13.612
Who the fuck do you work for?

1:20:13.714 --> 1:20:16.116
Santa Claus, bitch.

1:20:18.885 --> 1:20:20.815
Tell me his fucking name.

1:20:20.918 --> 1:20:22.520
Fuck you.

1:20:22.623 --> 1:20:23.426
Fuck you!

1:20:23.528 --> 1:20:24.886
That's enough, Shelby John.

1:20:24.988 --> 1:20:26.390
That's enough.

1:20:27.693 --> 1:20:28.397
Mike?

1:20:28.499 --> 1:20:29.791
Time to end this, son.

1:20:29.893 --> 1:20:31.197
Come on.

1:20:32.064 --> 1:20:33.628
I come to bring you home, son.

1:20:34.937 --> 1:20:35.830
There ain't no home for me no
more.

1:20:35.933 --> 1:20:36.901
I know it.

1:20:37.003 --> 1:20:37.834
But Ruby made her own choices.

1:20:37.936 --> 1:20:39.100
Same as Maken did.

1:20:39.202 --> 1:20:40.236
I don't like it neither,

1:20:40.338 --> 1:20:42.044
but that don't make it any less
true,

1:20:42.146 --> 1:20:44.978
and beating this pile of shit to
death won't bring her back.

1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:46.282
As soon as my lawyer's done with
your ass--

1:20:46.384 --> 1:20:48.478
Will you shut up?

1:20:48.580 --> 1:20:50.645
I may be crazy, Sheriff, but I
ain't stupid.

1:20:52.182 --> 1:20:53.316
Yeah, Ruby had choices,

1:20:53.419 --> 1:20:55.122
but some of them choices were
made for her.

1:20:56.460 --> 1:20:57.623
I tried to protect--

1:20:57.725 --> 1:20:59.126
I tried to protect--

1:21:02.191 --> 1:21:04.098
Don't do it, please.

1:21:06.029 --> 1:21:07.535
Please, Mike.

1:21:07.637 --> 1:21:09.765
Do it. Come on, end this.

1:21:09.867 --> 1:21:10.901
No, no.

1:21:11.003 --> 1:21:14.001
Please, bring me mercy.

1:21:14.103 --> 1:21:16.341
Either you do it, or I'm gonna
shoot this motherfucker right
here.

1:21:17.682 --> 1:21:19.645
Drop the weapon.

1:21:19.747 --> 1:21:22.076
Lieutenant, please.

1:21:22.178 --> 1:21:23.319
I've lost too much.

1:21:23.421 --> 1:21:25.046
I know.

1:21:25.148 --> 1:21:26.486
Ain't no way, son.

1:21:26.588 --> 1:21:27.688
Not like this.

1:21:27.790 --> 1:21:28.486
I've lost too much.

1:21:28.588 --> 1:21:29.590
No.

1:21:29.692 --> 1:21:30.523
This ain't how you win.

1:21:30.625 --> 1:21:31.391
Not on my watch.

1:21:31.493 --> 1:21:32.623
Come on.

1:21:32.725 --> 1:21:33.690
Come on.

1:21:33.792 --> 1:21:35.659
Come on.

1:21:35.761 --> 1:21:37.098
Come on.

1:21:40.999 --> 1:21:42.700
You can't do this.

1:21:42.802 --> 1:21:44.666
Come on, huh?

1:22:12.032 --> 1:22:13.497
Help me get her out of here.

1:22:14.704 --> 1:22:15.802
Can't go back that way.

1:22:15.904 --> 1:22:17.270
Let's get her down to the road.

1:22:21.644 --> 1:22:23.707
Wait, wait, stop.

1:22:23.809 --> 1:22:25.645
Please.

1:22:25.747 --> 1:22:26.708
We need your help.

1:22:27.814 --> 1:22:29.650
She's been shot.

1:22:29.752 --> 1:22:31.020
Is she alright?

1:22:31.122 --> 1:22:32.519
No please, we need to get her in
the back of the truck.

1:22:32.621 --> 1:22:33.618
Well, hurry up.

1:22:47.165 --> 1:22:49.999
Hey, you save her, Mike.

1:22:50.101 --> 1:22:50.836
You save her, Mike.

1:22:50.938 --> 1:22:52.472
Shelby, you be careful.

1:22:52.574 --> 1:22:54.106
Go on.

1:22:54.208 --> 1:22:55.974
Come on. You say something to me
now.

1:22:56.076 --> 1:22:57.611
Come on, you can say something.

1:22:57.713 --> 1:22:58.743
Come on, I know you.

1:22:58.845 --> 1:22:59.877
Talk to me.

1:22:59.979 --> 1:23:00.944
That's it, fight it.

1:23:01.046 --> 1:23:01.747
Fight, whatever--

1:24:10.915 --> 1:24:12.715

Shelby John.

1:25:05.775 --> 1:25:07.308
You've been busy.

1:25:09.011 --> 1:25:10.706
You believe in God?

1:25:10.808 --> 1:25:14.077
Been in church every Sunday in
my life.

1:25:14.179 --> 1:25:15.514
Ain't what I asked.

1:25:16.687 --> 1:25:17.815
I do.

1:25:17.917 --> 1:25:19.287
Do you?

1:25:20.789 --> 1:25:22.356
I do now.

1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:25.486
Gave Ruby over
to the hands of God

1:25:25.588 --> 1:25:27.229
when I put her in that river.

1:25:29.933 --> 1:25:32.028
And now you're doing God's work.

1:25:32.130 --> 1:25:33.499
Is that it?

1:25:35.668 --> 1:25:40.339
You think God approves of what
you've been doing?

1:25:40.442 --> 1:25:42.574
You know, I didn't want to admit
it to myself.

1:25:43.875 --> 1:25:46.611
But I was relieved when Sheriff
Church caught up to me.

1:25:46.713 --> 1:25:49.383
Didn't know I wanted to be
stopped until I was stopped.

1:25:52.449 --> 1:25:54.322
And things kept going.

1:25:55.385 --> 1:25:56.852
Out of my control.

1:25:58.460 --> 1:26:00.861
If that wasn't God pushing me to
do his business,

1:26:00.963 --> 1:26:02.594
I don't know what it was.

1:26:06.435 --> 1:26:09.469
Everything I've done,
I've done for my family.

1:26:14.472 --> 1:26:16.306
Does Darlene know what you do?

1:26:16.408 --> 1:26:18.577
Don't you worry about Darlene.

1:26:22.048 --> 1:26:23.450
And Conor?

1:26:23.552 --> 1:26:27.221
Boy's sound asleep upstairs, not
a care in the world.

1:26:27.324 --> 1:26:30.517
Because all his needs are
provided for him.

1:26:30.619 --> 1:26:34.362
Think he'd feel the same if he
knew how his daddy bought all
these nice things?

1:26:43.901 --> 1:26:49.239
When God commanded Abraham to
slay his son,

1:26:49.341 --> 1:26:50.845
Abraham did not refuse.

1:26:50.947 --> 1:26:53.214
He was ready to comply.

1:26:53.316 --> 1:26:55.845
See, that is the story that
scares people.

1:26:57.019 --> 1:26:58.114
Even though it's a faith.

1:26:58.216 --> 1:26:59.685
But not me.

1:26:59.787 --> 1:27:02.987
Because Abraham understood he
was part of something bigger

1:27:03.089 --> 1:27:04.623
than himself.

1:27:04.725 --> 1:27:07.725
Bigger than his son who he loved
with all his heart.

1:27:09.795 --> 1:27:13.929
We cannot pretend to understand
the mind of God.

1:27:15.268 --> 1:27:16.797
We can only sacrifice

1:27:16.899 --> 1:27:20.606
what we are called upon to
sacrifice.

1:27:29.052 --> 1:27:31.485
It started with a simple favor.

1:27:32.517 --> 1:27:34.950
I had over extended myself.

1:27:36.260 --> 1:27:39.860
I was on the verge of losing
everything.

1:27:39.962 --> 1:27:42.562
Then I met a man.

1:27:42.664 --> 1:27:46.396
It was not on no crossroads or
anything so dramatic.

1:27:46.498 --> 1:27:48.601
And he offered me a lifeline.

1:27:51.101 --> 1:27:55.069
And all I had to do was
transport something for him.

1:27:56.441 --> 1:27:59.510
I told myself at the time,

1:27:59.612 --> 1:28:03.452
"You are making bargain with the
devil."

1:28:03.554 --> 1:28:07.955
But I said to myself, "This is--
it's just this one time."

1:28:08.057 --> 1:28:09.253
Darlene was pregnant.

1:28:09.355 --> 1:28:10.959
We were gonna lose house.

1:28:11.061 --> 1:28:13.461
So I did the man his favor.

1:28:15.329 --> 1:28:17.597
God did not strike me down.

1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:20.664
God rewarded me.

1:28:20.766 --> 1:28:25.207
And I do not mean with earthly
possessions.

1:28:25.309 --> 1:28:29.670
I'm talking about new found
sense of peace

1:28:29.772 --> 1:28:33.742
of self-reliance so strong,

1:28:33.844 --> 1:28:37.551
that when the man came calling
again,

1:28:40.150 --> 1:28:46.388
I took what belonged to him for
myself, and I never,

1:28:46.490 --> 1:28:48.364
ever looked back.

1:28:49.995 --> 1:28:53.996
I left my old self behind like
the husk of a cicada.
