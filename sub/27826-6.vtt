WEBVTT

00:11.750 --> 00:13.500
Here we are on "Overtime".

00:13.583 --> 00:15.083
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:15.166 --> 00:16.250
Well...

00:16.333 --> 00:18.417
-Look at all these questions.
-Wow.

00:18.625 --> 00:20.792
Congressman,
what will Democrats do

00:20.875 --> 00:22.834
to stop social media
manipulation

00:23.083 --> 00:26.083
by the Russians and Republicans
in the next election?

00:27.250 --> 00:29.250
Well, we're doing a lot already.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.000
We've been continuing
to investigate

00:31.083 --> 00:33.500
just how the Russians
manipulated social media,

00:33.583 --> 00:36.834
what other countries
are now starting to do
to follow their example,

00:37.041 --> 00:39.834
but the problem is sadly
even broader than that.

00:39.917 --> 00:45.041
-Uh. We saw in Alabama
even Democrats experimenting...
-BILL: Yeah.

00:45.125 --> 00:47.917
...with false flag operations
on social media.

00:48.417 --> 00:50.166
You now have
the very real prospect

00:50.250 --> 00:52.667
that domestic people
are going to use social media

00:52.750 --> 00:55.375
-to do the same kind
of mischief...
-BILL: Like Maine?

00:55.458 --> 00:59.375
...the Russians did. So...
we are doing our best
to get out good information,

00:59.458 --> 01:01.959
we're continuing to press
the social media companies

01:02.166 --> 01:04.959
to disclose more and more
of the false information

01:05.041 --> 01:07.959
that took place
during the last election
and the one before that.

01:08.333 --> 01:11.125
-Uh... And we're also--
BILL: You can't really
stop it all, can you?

01:11.208 --> 01:15.750
I mean, it's up to the people
ultimately to get sophisticated.

01:15.834 --> 01:19.208
Because, you know,
when they talk about
the "liberal" media,

01:19.291 --> 01:22.417
the media isn't liberal anymore
'cause the media
is social media.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.417
DONNA: Right.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.375
And social media isn't
liberal or conservative,
it's fucked up.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.458
(LAUGHTER)

01:28.542 --> 01:31.166
But I think you're
identifying a real problem,

01:31.500 --> 01:35.083
it's that there is
a generation now,
mostly 60 plus,

01:35.458 --> 01:38.250
that when they read on
"RealEaglePatriotNews

01:38.458 --> 01:41.458
-Buzzfeed3000.ru"...
-(BILL LAUGHS)

01:41.542 --> 01:44.458
...and they see a story
about Hillary being
a robot lesbian,

01:44.542 --> 01:46.542
-they go "Ahh!"
-(LAUGHTER)

01:46.625 --> 01:48.667
-And they love that stuff...
-BILL: Right.

01:48.750 --> 01:49.750
...and they become addicted
to it.

01:49.834 --> 01:50.959
-BILL: And she's not a robot.
-(AUDIENCE GROANS)

01:51.041 --> 01:53.667
-RICK: Well, that I know of.
-(LAUGHTER)

01:54.500 --> 01:55.500
So bad!

01:55.667 --> 01:57.291
So bad!
We're bad, we're terrible.

01:57.375 --> 01:58.709
We make jokes, it's horrible.

01:58.792 --> 02:00.041
But I agree
with Congressman Schiff.

02:00.125 --> 02:03.792
We have to first identify
how these social media companies

02:03.875 --> 02:06.792
are collecting funds
for these advertisements.

02:06.875 --> 02:09.458
If we don't do that,
if we don't get them
to disclose,

02:09.542 --> 02:12.542
then it's very difficult for us
to follow the money

02:12.625 --> 02:16.083
and to understand how
they are using it
to manipulate our elections.

02:16.166 --> 02:20.417
Okay, Claire, should moderates
be working to make
the Green New Deal better

02:20.500 --> 02:22.208
rather than just dismissing it?

02:22.291 --> 02:24.333
I don't-- I don't think
anybody's dismissing it.

02:24.417 --> 02:26.333
-First of all--
-Nancy Pelosi, kind of.

02:26.417 --> 02:27.458
Well, here's the thing,

02:27.542 --> 02:29.291
there's no--
there's nothing there.

02:29.375 --> 02:32.208
-It's an idea,
and there's no meat on the bone.
-BILL: It's an idea.

02:32.291 --> 02:33.625
-BILL: Right.
-So, what we have to do

02:33.709 --> 02:34.959
is, our party, all of us,

02:35.041 --> 02:39.500
agree that being environmentally
responsible also creates jobs...

02:39.583 --> 02:41.625
-BILL: (CHUCKLES) Yeah.
-...and helps the economy.

02:41.709 --> 02:44.458
And there is a reason that
we should come together

02:44.542 --> 02:47.000
and stop trying
to divide our party--

02:47.083 --> 02:49.333
"Oh, they're the progressives,
and she's a dirty moderate."

02:49.417 --> 02:51.500
You know, we all kind of need
to be together on this one.

02:51.583 --> 02:52.959
-BILL: Right.
-And I think this is one of--

02:53.041 --> 02:54.709
BILL: It's not that hard.
It's amazing to me

02:54.792 --> 02:56.542
how Republicans,
I see it on the show
all the time,

02:56.625 --> 02:58.667
they get away
with talking points

02:58.750 --> 03:01.000
about the environment
from the '90s!

03:01.208 --> 03:03.250
They're not even
up-to-date talking points.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.667
Right, right.
Let's talk about science
and let's come together.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.208
-Can I just say, because...
I like the Green New Deal.
-I do too.

03:08.291 --> 03:10.625
-And I like how
aggressive it is.
-I do too.

03:10.709 --> 03:12.083
And look at the contrast,
you've got the Democrats

03:12.291 --> 03:13.875
pushing aggressively
in the Green New Deal,

03:14.166 --> 03:16.750
and what are
the Republicans and Trump doing?

03:17.041 --> 03:20.208
They're appointing
a climate denier
to head a climate commission.

03:20.291 --> 03:22.500
-BILL: Yeah.
-They're pulling out of
the Paris climate accords.

03:22.583 --> 03:25.625
-BILL: I know.
-They're appointing a oil
and gas lobbyist

03:25.709 --> 03:27.041
as the Secretary of Interior.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.208
-If you're gonna choose
between those two...
-We win.

03:29.291 --> 03:31.667
-...I'm gonna go with
aggressively environmental.
-CLAIRE: Yeah, I agree.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.792
-Me too.
-BILL: Okay, uh...

03:33.875 --> 03:36.709
(APPLAUSE)

03:36.792 --> 03:39.250
Which one of the five kings
from your book

03:39.542 --> 03:42.250
currently represents
the greatest threat to the U.S.?

03:42.333 --> 03:43.542
And when you're talking
about five kings

03:43.625 --> 03:45.542
you're talking about
five countries--

03:45.625 --> 03:49.875
I guess you're talking about
the Sunni as an entity,

03:49.959 --> 03:51.250
that's not one country...

03:51.333 --> 03:53.959
All five are dangerous
for the U.S.

03:54.041 --> 03:56.041
-But you're talking
about China, Russia...
-China, yes.

03:56.125 --> 03:57.959
...but then two
that I wouldn't have guessed,

03:58.041 --> 04:00.583
but they were empires
in the past:

04:00.667 --> 04:04.375
-Persia, currently Iran,
and the Ottoman Empire, Turkey.
-Mm-hmm.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.875
Now, if we're gonna get
our ass kicked
by the Ottoman Empire again,

04:06.959 --> 04:11.083
-we are worse than I thought.
-CLAIRE: We're in trouble.
-(LAUGHTER)

04:11.166 --> 04:15.583
But America is an unwilling,
reluctant empire.

04:15.667 --> 04:20.083
The peculiarity of America
is that even when America
is an empire,

04:20.291 --> 04:23.959
-it is reluctantly, un--
Yes, of course.
-BILL: But...

04:24.166 --> 04:25.166
unwillingly.

04:26.458 --> 04:29.500
There is a quote from
a very famous writer,

04:29.583 --> 04:33.542
which is "Americans are
involuntary Romans."

04:34.083 --> 04:36.375
-Roman, uh... Romans.
-Romantics, yeah. Sure, sure.

04:36.458 --> 04:38.500
No, no. Romans. Italians.

04:38.667 --> 04:42.375
-Oh, I see.
-An empire from an involuntary--
-Romans, right.

04:42.458 --> 04:45.166
And this is the difference.
Putin is
a voluntary imperialist.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.917
China wants really
to shape the world.

04:48.333 --> 04:50.917
Erdogan wants to have
all the area

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
of the former Ottoman Empire
back under his rule.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.834
-But we have troops in--
-America has--

04:55.917 --> 04:57.208
How many countries
do we have troops in?

04:57.417 --> 04:59.875
Like over a hundred.
We have bases
all around the world.

04:59.959 --> 05:01.792
If we're so reluctant,
why do we do it so much?

05:01.875 --> 05:03.375
-Look at what you--
-Why do we never leave anywhere?

05:03.458 --> 05:04.959
We still have troops in Germany.

05:05.041 --> 05:07.750
You are leaving.
Donald Trump is leaving.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.458
That's good for you maybe,
I dunno.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.125
That's the one good thing
I thought he was maybe gonna do.

05:11.208 --> 05:12.166
No.

05:12.875 --> 05:16.417
Donald Trump has two thou--
You have, America has,
2000 troops in Syria...

05:16.500 --> 05:17.375
Yeah.

05:17.709 --> 05:22.000
...whose task is to protect
the last Syrian democrats

05:22.250 --> 05:24.625
who were not exterminated
and butchered.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.375
Whose task is to protect
the last Kurds,

05:27.542 --> 05:30.041
who were our allies
and whom we betrayed,

05:30.375 --> 05:34.208
and Donald Trump wants to
withdraw this 2000

05:34.291 --> 05:37.166
-special unit of American
soldiers. This is very bad.
-(APPLAUSE)

05:37.417 --> 05:40.667
Let's end on a feel-good story:
the Isis brides are coming home.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.417
(LAUGHTER)

05:44.083 --> 05:46.792
No, there are two Isis brides
I read about this week.

05:46.875 --> 05:50.333
One British woman
who is not sorry about it.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.667
She said when she saw people
beheaded she said,

05:53.750 --> 05:56.250
"That's good, because,
you know, they're obviously
enemies of Islam."

05:56.333 --> 05:57.583
DONNA: She's losing
her citizenship.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.208
But the American girl,
she's from Alabama,

05:59.291 --> 06:01.834
she feels very bad about it,
Trump wouldn't let her in.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.917
-Should they be able
to come back?
-No.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.834
-Well, the Trump administration
said, right off the bat,
-BILL: No.

06:05.917 --> 06:07.709
"She can't come back,
she's not an American citizen."

06:07.792 --> 06:10.500
Well, there is some question
about whether her father

06:10.583 --> 06:12.083
was still a diplomat
when she was born.

06:12.166 --> 06:14.667
If he wasn't,
and she was born in the U.S.,
then she's a U.S. citizen.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.667
-BILL: Right.
-Now, what should happen to her?

06:16.750 --> 06:18.959
She should be brought back
to the U.S. as a U.S. citizen.

06:19.041 --> 06:21.542
-She should be indicted
and taken to court...
-DONNA: That's right.

06:21.625 --> 06:24.041
...because she went out and
joined a terrorist operation.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.041
-Right. That's it.
-And I'm sorry she feels bad
about it...

06:26.125 --> 06:28.250
-(APPLAUSE)
-...but the reason
we have to do it that way

06:28.333 --> 06:30.125
is that
the rule of law matters.

06:30.375 --> 06:33.041
Just Mike Pompeo
and Donald Trump said
"Nope, she can't come back."

06:33.125 --> 06:34.792
-That's not following
the rule of law.
-Well, the courts will

06:34.875 --> 06:36.417
figure out whether
she's a citizen or not,

06:36.500 --> 06:37.875
but what we should
be talking about,

06:37.959 --> 06:40.291
there are thousands
of interpreters...

06:40.667 --> 06:44.917
-RICK: Yes.
-...in Iraq and Afghanistan
who saved Americans' lives...

06:45.000 --> 06:47.709
-BILL: Right.
-...who worked shoulder to
shoulder with American troops...

06:47.959 --> 06:49.542
-...and this administration...
-RICK: That Trump
is leaving to die.

06:49.625 --> 06:51.375
-...has cut off their visas.
-That's right.

06:51.458 --> 06:54.834
So, let's forget about
the woman who wanted
to kill the West...

06:54.917 --> 06:57.125
-(APPLAUSE)
-...and let's get
these interpreters...

06:57.208 --> 06:59.417
-MAN: Yup. One hundred percent.
-...who are in danger
every day,

06:59.500 --> 07:00.750
and get them over here.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.834
You know, just to show--
You were talking earlier

07:03.083 --> 07:05.875
-about the hypocrisy
of the administration...
-BILL: Mm.

07:06.667 --> 07:09.250
When we were in Europe
on the delegation to Munich

07:09.333 --> 07:12.291
and to NATO in Brussels,
we met with Belgian leaders,

07:12.542 --> 07:15.166
and the first thing
they raised with us,
not surprisingly,

07:15.250 --> 07:17.458
was a tweet of the President's
in which--

07:17.542 --> 07:20.000
hours before a meeting
the President had tweeted:

07:20.458 --> 07:22.458
Um... "You-- Europe,
you better take back..."

07:22.667 --> 07:24.542
These 800 foreign fighters

07:24.834 --> 07:28.250
that we are gonna basically
let go when we leave,

07:28.333 --> 07:30.917
when we pull out of Syria,"
and I agree with you
completely,

07:31.000 --> 07:32.291
I think that would be a mistake.

07:32.750 --> 07:36.417
"You better take them back,
because if you don't,
I'm just gonna release them."

07:36.500 --> 07:39.458
And they said to us,
"You're our ally,

07:39.542 --> 07:42.959
and we have to learn about this,
not in private diplomatic
discussions,

07:43.166 --> 07:45.000
-but in a threatening way
on Twitter."
-(BILL GROANS)

07:45.375 --> 07:48.625
And then,
less than two days later,

07:48.709 --> 07:51.500
the President says:
"Oh, that woman and child,

07:52.000 --> 07:53.125
I've instructed
the Secretary of State

07:53.208 --> 07:54.959
not to allow them
into the country."

07:55.041 --> 07:57.250
So, "Europe, you take those 800,
but I'm not gonna allow..."

07:57.333 --> 07:58.333
CLAIRE: "I'm not gonna take..."

07:58.834 --> 08:01.375
"...a woman and child to come
to the United States
for prosecution.

08:01.834 --> 08:05.750
How can you maintain any kind
of credibility or leadership...

08:06.333 --> 08:09.041
-when you--
-Your lack of consistency
to this extent...

08:09.125 --> 08:10.458
-No consistency.
-All right.

08:10.542 --> 08:13.291
-You tell them that
on Fox News next week.
-Baby Trump--

08:13.375 --> 08:15.959
-(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
-Baby Trump lacks consistency.
