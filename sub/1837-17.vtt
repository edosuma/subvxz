18:54.100 --> 18:55.900
OK, I'M A ROCK, MAN!

18:55.900 --> 18:58.000
[GRUNTING]

18:59.600 --> 19:01.767
OH, NO, SHE DIDN'T.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.567
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:09.100 --> 19:12.133
"RAVEN AND CHELSEA.
NICE VERSION."

19:12.133 --> 19:13.467
[STRAINED VOICE]:
YOU'RE...

19:13.467 --> 19:15.500
GOING...DOWN.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.667
[STRAINED VOICE]: I'M...
I'M...I'M STAYING UP.

19:19.667 --> 19:21.367
[STRAINING]

19:21.367 --> 19:23.233
WHAT IS CHELSEA REALLY LIKE?

19:23.233 --> 19:25.400
CHELSEA IS SUCH A GOOD FRIEND,

19:25.400 --> 19:27.200
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO LOSE HER.

19:27.200 --> 19:31.000
AND THAT'S COMING
FROM MY HEART.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.100
WHAT?

19:32.100 --> 19:33.100
YOU SAID THAT?

19:33.100 --> 19:34.467
OH, MAN, IT SOUNDS
SO MUCH BETTER

19:34.467 --> 19:36.233
WITH ALL THOSE
OTHER WORDS IN THERE.

19:36.233 --> 19:37.467
WHO PLAYED THAT TAPE?

19:37.467 --> 19:38.767
FIRST RULE IN SHOW BUSINESS:

19:38.767 --> 19:43.700
NEVER LEAVE YOUR TAPES
BY THE DOUGHNUT TABLE, OK?

19:43.700 --> 19:44.500
[CLICKING]

19:44.500 --> 19:46.500
I DON'T KNOW WHY ANY BOY
WOULDN'T PICK RAVEN.

19:46.500 --> 19:50.300
SHE'S A FANTASTIC FRIEND
AND NOT A BACKSTABBER.

19:50.300 --> 19:53.700
OH, CHELS, THAT'S SO SWEET.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.200
YOU KNOW WHAT, CHELS?

19:56.200 --> 19:57.000
WHAT?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.367
THEY MESSED WITH OUR TAPES.

19:58.367 --> 19:59.800
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
THAT I WOULD THINK

19:59.800 --> 20:02.500
THAT YOU WOULD SAY
ALL THOSE MEAN THINGS
ABOUT ME.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.300
YEAH, I GOT
CAUGHT UP, TOO, GIRL.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.700
I'M SORRY.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.100
AW, ME, TOO.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.100
HUG?
HUG.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.367
[GRUNTING]

20:17.667 --> 20:19.133
YOU KNOW WHAT'S AMAZING?

20:19.133 --> 20:20.000
HUH?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.200
YOU HAVE A LOT OF
UPPER BODY STRENGTH.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.200
THANKS, CHELS.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.200
YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.600
I WORK OUT. YOU WORK OUT?

20:25.600 --> 20:26.300
YEAH. I DO,

20:26.300 --> 20:27.567
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
VERY IMPORTANT.

20:27.567 --> 20:28.700
YOU SEE THAT?

20:28.700 --> 20:29.867
YOU CANNOT TEAR US APART.

20:29.867 --> 20:33.934
YEAH, YEAH,
YOU CANNOT MESS UP
OUR FRIENDSHIP OVER A BOY.

20:33.934 --> 20:35.467
YEAH, NO MATTER HOW CUTE...

20:35.467 --> 20:36.200
YEAH, OR ADORABLE...

20:36.200 --> 20:39.567
...OR FUN HE MAY BE.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.667
WE QUIT.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.200
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
WHY NOT?

20:43.200 --> 20:44.400
BECAUSE SOMEONE
HAS TO FALL

20:44.400 --> 20:46.400
INTO THIS VERY
EXPENSIVE TAR PIT.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.567
ZAP 'EM!

20:47.567 --> 20:48.767

Rodney: JUST KIDDING.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.734
GETS THEM EVERY TIME.

20:53.734 --> 20:56.233
WELL, THAT'S
OUR SHOW FOR TONIGHT.

20:56.233 --> 20:56.867
TUNE IN NEXT WEEK

20:56.867 --> 20:59.400
WHEN WE'LL TRY TO WORK OUT
THE KINKS IN OUR GAME

20:59.400 --> 21:01.233
AND HOPEFULLY FIND
4 NEW LADIES

21:01.233 --> 21:03.567
WHO DON'T HAVE THAT KIND
OF UPPER BODY STRENGTH.

21:03.567 --> 21:06.000
UNTIL THEN, I'M RODNEY--

21:06.000 --> 21:08.467
[YELLING]

21:08.467 --> 21:10.800
OH! OH! OH!

21:10.800 --> 21:12.767
SORRY, RODNEY!

21:12.767 --> 21:14.367
YOU'VE JUST BEEN...

21:14.367 --> 21:16.734

[APPLAUSE]

21:26.100 --> 21:28.400
YO. THE WHOLE SCHOOL

21:28.400 --> 21:30.200
EVERYBODY SAW Y'ALL

21:30.200 --> 21:32.300
OOH! DID THEY THINK
WE WERE COOL?

21:32.300 --> 21:34.734
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME,
RAE?

21:34.734 --> 21:35.400
THEY ALL SAW YOU.

21:35.400 --> 21:39.000
CAN YOU EVEN BELIEVE
HOW COMPETITIVE WE GOT?

21:39.000 --> 21:42.033
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT I COULD
HAVE HELD ON TO THAT BAR

21:42.033 --> 21:43.934
FOR, LIKE,
ANOTHER 5 MINUTES.

21:43.934 --> 21:45.400
YEAH, I COULD HAVE DONE

21:45.400 --> 21:47.133
AT LEAST ANOTHER,
I DON'T KNOW, 10.

21:47.133 --> 21:49.100
YEAH, 15.
20.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.834
YOU THINK SO?
I KNOW SO.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.400
THEN BRING IT.

22:00.066 --> 22:01.500
