00:01.160 --> 00:02.160
Jacs is threatening Debbie.

00:02.240 --> 00:03.480
Can't you do something about that?

00:03.560 --> 00:05.320
Normal rules don't apply to Jacs.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.800
Yeah. Your daughter's fucked.

00:07.480 --> 00:08.720
You'd get bored with me.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.560
- Oh, I doubt that.
- Well, yes, you would.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.400
And then you'd dump me, and we'd
have to keep working together.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.760
And that would be really awkward.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.080
Well, seven years at the top.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.880
You don't get there without
making a few enemies.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.360
I haven't heard much talk
of you on the compound.

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800
It worries me.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.240
The officers have also noticed a
significant change in the women,

00:26.520 --> 00:27.680
who they're looking to.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.080
You wanna have a go at
me? Then have a go at me.

00:32.159 --> 00:33.720
Don't you dare use my family to do it.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.080
You put yourself in the mix.

00:35.640 --> 00:36.920
The women are looking to you now.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.880
I've got my lawyer
drawing up divorce papers.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.960
Tell Brayden to come and see me.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.560
It's time.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.520
Time to break up with Debbie.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

01:56.040 --> 01:57.160
That's it, Boomer.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.560
Be sexy.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.400
Yeah, come on.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.920
Your hips don't move.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.240
- That was it.
- No, she hasn't.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.840
Roll your hips.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.800
That's what I'm doing.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.960
Oh, Booms. You look like
you're humping a dog.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.520
Liz's turn. Liz's turn.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.720
Hey, boss. Hey, boss. Show us what you got.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.240
Turn it off.

02:58.840 --> 02:59.880
Turn it off!

02:59.960 --> 03:01.360
Ooh, cranky pants.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.840
- Bea?
- Hmm?

03:07.160 --> 03:08.360
You're needed in medical.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.760
Is there a problem?

03:11.200 --> 03:12.880
Just come with me now, please.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.120
Do you reckon it's a drug test maybe?

03:24.640 --> 03:25.720
Don't know.

03:25.800 --> 03:26.840
Have I done something wrong?

03:26.920 --> 03:29.360
No, you haven't done anything wrong.
If you could just come with us, Bea?

03:29.920 --> 03:31.320
What is it? Can you just tell me here?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.160
Let's get you to medical first.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.640
Well, just...

03:35.720 --> 03:37.200
No, I want to know now.

03:37.840 --> 03:38.880
Bea.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.880
Can you just... Can you
just say what it is now?

03:46.120 --> 03:47.640
It's a personal matter, Bea.

03:47.840 --> 03:48.840
Is it Debbie?

03:49.120 --> 03:51.400
Is she okay? Where is she?

03:55.280 --> 03:57.000
Can someone just tell me if she's okay?

03:58.640 --> 03:59.920
Please! Anybody!

04:01.280 --> 04:03.720
Just tell me! Please!

04:03.800 --> 04:05.960
Is she okay? Please!

04:06.720 --> 04:08.280
Tell me. Please.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.800
Okay. We can't do this here.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.800
- Please!
- Where's Fletch?

04:11.880 --> 04:13.600
Please! Someone say something.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.280
Tell me!

04:26.040 --> 04:27.320
Hi.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.480
Do you want milk for that?

04:29.720 --> 04:30.840
Yeah.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.280
It's awful about Bea. I
can't imagine how she feels.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.560
She should have thought about her
kid before she ended up in here.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.760
Last night, your husband found
Debbie in her bedroom unconscious.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.440
Now the ambulance came and they
tried everything they could,

04:54.520 --> 04:57.000
but I'm sorry, Bea, they were too late.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.680
They're still waiting
on a toxicology report

04:59.760 --> 05:01.080
but it would appear at this stage

05:01.160 --> 05:03.040
that the cause of death
was a heroin overdose.

05:05.760 --> 05:09.320
Uh, Debbie... Debbie doesn't use drugs.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.680
There was a syringe by her bed
and a needle mark in her arm.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.280
No, no, no, no. No, no. She...

05:16.120 --> 05:18.280
No, it must be a mistake. She doesn't...

05:18.360 --> 05:21.360
I'm afraid it isn't, Bea. Your husband
identified the body. I'm sorry, Bea.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.600
I'll just go and talk to her.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.080
You won't be able to
talk to them. I'm sorry.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.520
We're gonna need some sedation in here.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.600
Calm down.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.480
- Debbie!
- It's okay.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.960
They're gonna sedate you, okay?

05:33.520 --> 05:35.720
No! No! No!

05:36.000 --> 05:38.440
- No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
- You okay?

05:38.520 --> 05:39.640
I'm okay.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.960
- I've got it.
- I'm okay.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.400
Bea, I am so sorry for your loss.

05:57.680 --> 05:58.960
I want to talk to Harry.

05:59.880 --> 06:00.880
I need to talk to Harry.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.400
Okay.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.200
Hello.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.400
Harry?

06:18.760 --> 06:19.920
Is Deb there, please?

06:23.840 --> 06:24.840
Harry?

06:27.040 --> 06:28.760
Harry, they're saying all this stuff.

06:28.840 --> 06:29.880
They're wrong, right?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.280
Harry?

06:35.240 --> 06:38.000
Is she there? Can you... Is she okay?

06:41.440 --> 06:42.720
Harry, say something.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.440
Say something!

06:47.800 --> 06:48.960
I found her.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.520
Where? Found her where? Where is she?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.400
I don't know.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.520
What do you mean you don't
know? Where's my little girl?

07:10.640 --> 07:12.760
They told me at the hospital to go home.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.480
There was nothing more I could do.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.160
You need to go and be with her.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.800
She needs someone to take care of her.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.720
Just go and be there. She's all alone.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.680
Harry?

07:36.800 --> 07:38.080
Harry?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.640
Please, no!

08:19.680 --> 08:21.480
Please, no!

08:32.520 --> 08:33.640
So where the hell were you?

08:34.120 --> 08:35.280
Will was handling it.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.799
- You didn't need the two of us there.
- No. That's not your call to make.

08:38.679 --> 08:39.720
Yes, Governor.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.559
You just disappeared.
Anything could have happened.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.480
My apologies.

08:45.800 --> 08:46.920
Are you gonna tell me?

08:47.280 --> 08:48.280
Tell you what?

08:48.360 --> 08:51.080
What was so important that it
required your immediate attention?

08:51.160 --> 08:53.240
- It was a mistake.
- You pull something like that again...

08:53.320 --> 08:54.400
I won't.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.800
So do you need me to apologize again or...

08:59.880 --> 09:01.120
No, we're done.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.560
- Sir.
- Fletch.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.040
Good to see you and the
officers are playing nice.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.840
You look well rested. It must
have been a good holiday, Derek.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.400
Three weeks in paradise with
Lauren and the boys. Absolutely.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.840
It's good to be back.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.320
- Duty free.
- Well, thank you.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.040
I, uh, hear the women
have been keeping you busy.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.200
Nothing out of the ordinary.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.400
Well, if the last few weeks
is your benchmark for ordinary,

09:30.480 --> 09:32.040
then we do have a lot to talk about.

09:32.720 --> 09:33.720
Now?

09:35.840 --> 09:37.320
Unless you want to be home for dinner?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.320
Hey, Fletch.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.400
Fletch!

09:59.480 --> 10:00.520
I'm sorry.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.880
It's okay.

10:02.600 --> 10:06.480
I just wanted to say how much I
enjoyed going to the movies last night.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.520
Yeah. It was good.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.400
Come over tonight.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.600
- I'm sorry. What?
- Yeah. I'll cook.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.760
What are you in the mood for?

10:17.120 --> 10:18.160
Um...

10:19.360 --> 10:23.560
No, that sounds great but I should
probably spend the night home with Mum.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.760
Okay.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.320
Well, what about tomorrow night?

10:28.400 --> 10:29.760
Tomorrow night. Sounds great.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.600
All right. Tomorrow night. Good.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.680
Yeah.

10:34.440 --> 10:35.800
- Good night.
- Good night.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.440
The sooner we get Smith
back to her unit, the better.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.480
Oh, I'm just waiting on a psych consult.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.280
If she's calmed down, let her out.
The women will take care of her.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.040
The ring. It's a bit unexpected.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.320
Yeah. No. Not really.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.040
Didn't know you were seeing someone.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.360
Hmm.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.160
Marriage. Oh, it's a tough business.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.360
I've done it twice.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.280
No, I only plan on doing it once.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.440
So did I.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.240
But then I found myself, um...

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
Distracted.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.720
I don't relish the idea of
another divorce so I've, uh...

11:17.800 --> 11:19.800
Well, I've learned to be smarter about it.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.040
Allow yourself the distraction,

11:23.440 --> 11:27.200
but just make sure the other party
doesn't want to get caught either.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.000
Hmm?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.760
Are you propositioning me?

11:35.560 --> 11:36.640
Do you want me to?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.800
Not unless you want to get sued.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.720
I was merely offering you support, Erica.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.960
That's all.

11:53.240 --> 11:57.680
Sorry. My misunderstanding.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.800
Attention, compound. Attention, compound.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.440
The count is now complete.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.160
I know everything seems

12:18.080 --> 12:20.760
overwhelming right now but
we will help you through this.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.760
I can arrange for a grief counselor
to come see you if you like.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.720
I don't have time for a counselor.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.440
I have to organize a funeral.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.080
Will I be able to stay
around afterwards at the wake?

12:41.080 --> 12:42.880
Bea, you won't be able
to go to the funeral.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.880
Why?

12:49.080 --> 12:50.160
You're a double A rating.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.400
You're a high risk
because you're on remand.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.080
You're kidding.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.560
I'm her mother.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.400
I'm sorry.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.200
Look, if your record in here was
clean, then maybe we'd have grounds

13:04.280 --> 13:05.920
but smuggling drugs into a prison,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.360
it excludes you from any avenues of appeal.

13:09.640 --> 13:12.440
She's my daughter. I
should be at her funeral.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.600
I know. I'm sorry.

13:14.840 --> 13:18.080
Um... I can arrange for a prison
chaplain to come and see you.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.360
Screw the chaplain!

13:26.200 --> 13:28.080
Speak to Channing. He
could make an exception.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.880
Come on, Will, you know what
the chances of that happening.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.000
He'll listen to you.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.600
You want to get Bea's hopes up for nothing?

13:32.680 --> 13:34.200
You really think that's the
best thing for her right now.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.720
It's her daughter's funeral for God's sake.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.000
I know what it is.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.200
Miss Davidson...

13:42.080 --> 13:43.080
How's Bea?

13:43.320 --> 13:45.280
Yeah, she's doing as
well as can be expected.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.040
We're taking good care of her.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.120
Thanks. We'll be glad
to have her back with us.

13:50.840 --> 13:51.920
What about Debbie's funeral?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.560
I'll get her back to you as soon as I can.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.040
- We'll look after her.
- Before or after the funeral?

13:56.120 --> 13:58.760
Look, I'm sure you can appreciate,
that's a private matter for Bea.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.320
How's Bea?

14:07.400 --> 14:08.560
She's okay.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.400
Every mother's worst nightmare.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.120
I don't know. I reckon your
mum probably had some bad dreams

14:13.200 --> 14:14.280
when she saw you sliding out of her.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.600
Really, you gonna do this?

14:15.880 --> 14:17.800
Why don't you just scamper
off and let the grown-ups talk.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.920
How is your hand?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.520
Please. Both of you.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.880
Not now.

14:26.040 --> 14:29.040
You've been up all night,
Bea. You can't do that again.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.680
I go to sleep, then what?

14:31.120 --> 14:34.080
Well, if you're lucky, no dreams.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.680
Then you wake up.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.440
The first thing I think about
when I wake up in here is Debbie.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.560
Now the first thing I'm gonna think about

14:43.640 --> 14:45.160
when I wake up is that
my little girl is dead.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.240
Well, you don't forget.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.920
You just stop remembering so much.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.480
Now she's by herself.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.800
No one to hold her hand.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.360
I should be there. I
should be holding her hand.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.120
I should be telling her things.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.440
I know it's not the same,

15:22.760 --> 15:24.320
but what if I went?

15:26.720 --> 15:29.680
I can go and be with her for a while.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.400
You'd do that?

15:32.720 --> 15:33.720
Sure.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.120
Oh...

15:37.760 --> 15:39.760
Can you tell her one thing from me?

15:42.560 --> 15:43.800
Can you tell my baby

15:45.640 --> 15:47.720
that "Mummy loves you
to the moon and back?"

15:52.040 --> 15:53.240
Okay.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.920
Um... Fletch, it's Vera.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.599
I'm sorry...

17:16.200 --> 17:19.440
Um... I'm sorry for this short notice.
But my mum's not feeling well so...

17:20.480 --> 17:21.960
Look, maybe another time, okay?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.040
Okay. See you tomorrow.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.640
Home delivery.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.120
Oh... Fletch, I'm so sorry.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.880
I left you a message. Didn't you get it?

17:39.960 --> 17:44.000
Shit. Sorry. No. No. I didn't
get it. It's still warm.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.920
Hey, is your mum...

17:47.000 --> 17:49.560
Um... She's in bed with a headache.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.000
Good. 'Cause there isn't
enough for three anyway.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.560
Oh, shit. Sorry.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.440
That's okay. She's upstairs.
She's taken her pill.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.760
You'd have to drop the whole
drawer for her to wake up.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.760
Okay. Great.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.000
That looks good.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.720
You look even better.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.400
You taste of alcohol.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.000
Just wait. Wait. Wait.

19:19.760 --> 19:20.960
I want you.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.360
God. Sorry, I...

19:24.680 --> 19:25.960
I can put something else on.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.800
No, you're sexy just like this.

19:30.680 --> 19:31.880
You're sexy too.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.320
Sorry.

20:04.760 --> 20:05.880
What are you doing?

20:05.960 --> 20:07.040
You're not wet enough.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.480
No...

20:09.960 --> 20:11.360
You don't have to do that.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.240
Could you go now, please?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.200
I'm sorry.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.520
Please.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.560
Will, you tell me everything.

21:12.760 --> 21:13.840
Everything.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.320
It's a big building.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.440
Nice people work there.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.320
The morgue is in the basement.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.640
Two floors down in the elevator.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.120
And they're taking good care of her, Bea.

22:15.320 --> 22:16.560
She looks peaceful.

22:21.480 --> 22:25.080
I can see... I can see
that she looks like you.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.840
Did you tell her? Did you tell her?

22:38.480 --> 22:39.680
Yeah.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.360
Your mum loves you to the moon and back.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.880
- Getting old, buddy.
- No, I'm hung over.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.880
I would have made a
better go of it, otherwise.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.040
Big night?

23:15.280 --> 23:17.080
It was a shit night. I
really screwed up with Vera.

23:18.120 --> 23:19.760
- I doubt it.
- Why's that?

23:19.840 --> 23:21.640
You're not a figment of her imagination.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.040
Fuck you!

23:24.480 --> 23:25.880
That was funny.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.960
Whatever it is, just apologize, buddy.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.560
You must be talking about a woman.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.600
How are you, boys?

23:32.800 --> 23:33.840
Fine, sir.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.000
Oh, yeah?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.600
I hear the inmates have been running
the asylum while I've been away.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.360
No, it's under control.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.360
Well, I hope so, Will.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.280
Because I've been reading
these reports, and, uh...

23:45.120 --> 23:46.560
Well, I've just been wondering

23:47.040 --> 23:49.200
why the hell things have
gone so bad out there.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.200
Fletch?

23:53.760 --> 23:54.960
You've been here long enough.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.480
There's a reason we work
our way through the ranks.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.360
You can't lead without experience.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.040
You have to get your hands dirty.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.280
Attention, compound. Attention, compound...

24:04.920 --> 24:07.360
I've got to go. Nice to see you again, sir.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.720
You too, Will.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.720
I appreciate your honesty, Fletch.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.680
We should have a beer sometime.

24:16.680 --> 24:17.920
Keep the conversation going.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.320
Anytime, sir.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.560
She wouldn't want to wear a dress.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.240
Good jeans and that
green top that she loved.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.080
You know, the one with the straps.

24:32.920 --> 24:33.960
Yeah.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.560
It has to be nice for her, Harry.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.040
It will be.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.920
I want you to put this with her.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.120
I'll give it to the guard.
He can give it to you.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.160
You done?

25:04.520 --> 25:06.160
How could you not know she was on heroin?

25:06.360 --> 25:08.240
- Oh, for God's sake.
- You were supposed to look after her.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.280
I told you not to leave her and you did.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.600
I told you that you shouldn't
let her smoke dope and you did.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.680
What you didn't think that
our daughter was using drugs?

25:15.760 --> 25:18.120
You should have stuck around
and looked after her. Huh?

25:28.200 --> 25:29.280
I found her.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.760
I came home...

25:36.560 --> 25:38.720
I was there for an hour before I even knew.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.360
And she was lying there
while I was making dinner.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.200
Did you talk to the school? Do
they know who was giving it to her?

25:54.120 --> 25:55.320
They don't know.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.520
They said she was skipping school.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.800
And they didn't talk to you?

26:01.480 --> 26:03.280
Debbie was making up notes from me.

26:04.680 --> 26:07.400
And then I find out she was
lying about staying at Matilda's.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.360
She was staying at some boyfriend's place.

26:14.400 --> 26:15.600
She had a boyfriend?

26:20.080 --> 26:21.720
It's who came round with all that stuff.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.000
She told me.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.720
What was his name?

26:28.440 --> 26:29.600
Brayden.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.800
Brayden.

26:45.610 --> 26:47.210
Don't expect special treatment.

26:48.090 --> 26:49.130
I'm not.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.290
You know the way.

27:12.490 --> 27:13.610
They're not much but...

27:15.090 --> 27:16.210
They're new.

27:16.290 --> 27:17.530
They came in today.

27:21.610 --> 27:22.850
I like that guy.

27:25.570 --> 27:26.770
Thanks.

27:40.810 --> 27:42.090
Oh, Bea.

27:44.370 --> 27:46.410
Come on. Come on. We'll get you home, eh?

28:01.850 --> 28:03.010
Simmo.

28:03.290 --> 28:04.490
What are you playing?

28:04.690 --> 28:07.410
Patience. Come and join me.

28:07.490 --> 28:09.490
- I...
- We can play something else like...

28:09.810 --> 28:10.930
Go Fish.

28:20.530 --> 28:22.570
I thought you were going to the
canteen to get your magazines.

28:23.730 --> 28:24.890
Yeah, I did. They didn't have 'em.

28:27.730 --> 28:30.690
Pity. I love to keep up
with what's going on outside.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.530
The truth. The lies.

28:33.250 --> 28:34.530
Screws probably nicked 'em.

28:36.450 --> 28:37.730
They're a devious bunch.

28:38.290 --> 28:39.570
I should do something about that.

28:40.250 --> 28:42.810
I wouldn't worry about
it. It's not worth it.

28:45.050 --> 28:48.210
When you go back as far as we
do, nothing's too much trouble.

28:51.810 --> 28:55.370
On second thoughts, let's take a walk.

28:56.130 --> 28:59.210
Yeah. Everyone's been by but
I told 'em to come back later,

28:59.290 --> 29:00.650
so they didn't know...

29:01.650 --> 29:02.690
Thanks.

29:03.290 --> 29:04.730
You're allowed to go to Debbie's funeral?

29:07.050 --> 29:08.410
Oh. Oh, that's shit.

29:18.850 --> 29:21.010
Ooh, my favorites.

29:21.930 --> 29:23.010
How did you guess?

29:23.610 --> 29:24.930
My condolences.

29:26.290 --> 29:27.690
Make sure Bea gets this.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.570
We just don't think it's
fair Bea can't go today

29:39.650 --> 29:41.570
and we want you to do something about it.

29:41.650 --> 29:44.850
I understand, Doreen,
but Bea is a Double A risk

29:45.370 --> 29:46.490
and there are rules.

29:46.570 --> 29:49.130
Far out. It's her kid's funeral.

29:49.210 --> 29:51.210
She's not gonna go out and kill someone!

29:51.290 --> 29:52.610
I'm not gonna argue with you about this.

29:52.690 --> 29:54.530
You can't just brush us off like this!

29:55.450 --> 29:59.330
Miss Davidson, we know the
rules are there for a reason.

30:00.250 --> 30:01.810
But it doesn't mean they're always right.

30:02.570 --> 30:05.290
Like the wet cells, and you fixed that.

30:06.770 --> 30:09.490
Now, all the women are cut up
about what happened to Debbie.

30:10.090 --> 30:12.370
And they like Bea and if
she could go to the funeral

30:12.450 --> 30:13.970
that'd be the lift that everyone needs.

30:14.570 --> 30:16.530
See, stuff happens in here when the women

30:16.610 --> 30:19.090
feel ignored and when they
feel there is no hope for 'em.

30:21.130 --> 30:23.210
So please let her go.

30:54.890 --> 30:56.610
Well, I'm surprised you're even asking.

30:57.170 --> 30:59.250
Well, you know she's high
risk 'cause she's on remand.

31:00.010 --> 31:01.050
She's an unknown.

31:01.130 --> 31:02.730
The women look up to her.

31:03.610 --> 31:05.490
Look, we need to give
them something positive.

31:08.410 --> 31:11.170
She's smuggled drugs and been
involved in attacks and reprisals.

31:11.250 --> 31:12.530
There's no two-way street there.

31:14.450 --> 31:17.490
Erica, it really concerns
me you can't see that.

31:27.570 --> 31:28.810
The screws are here.

31:30.130 --> 31:31.250
Are you ready?

31:32.530 --> 31:34.170
Thank you so much for making this happen.

31:34.770 --> 31:35.970
It's all right.

31:37.490 --> 31:38.570
You all right?

31:52.130 --> 31:53.610
I've already given my approval.

31:54.130 --> 31:55.770
You know you don't have
authority to do that.

31:56.090 --> 31:57.730
You're gonna undermine my position.

31:57.810 --> 31:59.490
As you've undermined mine, yes.

33:05.610 --> 33:08.930
Hey, if you... You know,
you wanna talk or anything?

33:11.010 --> 33:12.850
Or if you just want us to leave you alone.

33:15.250 --> 33:17.090
Actually, I think I'll just go to bed.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.050
Yeah, well, yell out if you
need anything, won't you?

33:30.450 --> 33:31.570
Night-night.

33:34.290 --> 33:35.450
Night.

34:47.250 --> 34:48.770
Oh, shit! Bea!

34:49.130 --> 34:50.690
Oh, my God! Bea! Bea!

34:50.770 --> 34:51.810
Bea...

34:51.889 --> 34:53.090
Oh, my God! Help me!

34:54.170 --> 34:56.850
Someone help! It's Bea!

34:57.610 --> 34:58.650
Help!

34:58.930 --> 35:00.330
Get her onto the floor.

35:00.970 --> 35:02.090
Lift her up.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.530
Have you got her?

35:08.610 --> 35:10.090
I've got her. I've got her.

35:18.890 --> 35:21.250
Just get her head. Get it off.

35:22.450 --> 35:24.250
It's okay. It's okay.

35:25.090 --> 35:27.090
It's all right. It's all right.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.050
It's all right.

35:38.810 --> 35:39.970
You okay?

35:41.770 --> 35:44.570
Oh, it's a stupid question.
You just tried to top yourself.

35:45.530 --> 35:46.890
You think this is a joke?

35:47.610 --> 35:49.770
You think I'd try to kill
myself if I didn't want to die?

35:52.210 --> 35:53.410
Why did you even try to stop me?

35:54.570 --> 35:57.690
Why? So I can live through
this hell every day?

35:58.610 --> 36:00.810
Bea, I didn't have a
choice. You're my friend.

36:00.890 --> 36:02.570
You had a choice. You had a choice.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.450
You just didn't want to feel guilty.

36:07.410 --> 36:08.690
You're a bloody coward.

36:10.850 --> 36:12.170
Yeah, maybe I am.

36:12.250 --> 36:14.250
But trying to top yourself
doesn't make you a hero.

36:14.570 --> 36:15.770
What would you know about it?

36:17.290 --> 36:19.210
I've thought about
topping myself a few times.

36:22.330 --> 36:23.370
Why didn't you?

36:24.930 --> 36:26.090
'Cause I'm a coward.

36:26.890 --> 36:29.810
I don't know. I suppose I was hoping
with time, it would get easier.

36:30.410 --> 36:34.050
You know, that pain would get less.

36:35.650 --> 36:37.290
Not to forget, just to...

36:37.570 --> 36:40.250
Well, I don't know. Just to
find some joy in life again.

36:41.290 --> 36:42.370
And I have.

36:44.530 --> 36:45.690
I don't want that.

36:48.810 --> 36:50.330
What do you reckon
Debbie would want for you?

36:52.330 --> 36:54.250
It is always gonna hurt, Bea.

36:54.730 --> 36:56.210
And, mate, that's a good thing.

36:56.570 --> 36:58.690
'Cause that's how you know
you're still connected to them.

36:59.530 --> 37:00.850
And you always will be.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.450
You wanted to see me?

37:13.530 --> 37:14.610
Liz, take a seat.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.250
And before you start, I'm
not going to go into detail

37:17.330 --> 37:20.650
about why Bea couldn't go to the funeral
yesterday. It was a security issue.

37:21.050 --> 37:24.530
But I do understand that we now have
to go into some serious damage control.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.490
Which is why I would like you
to come back as peer worker.

37:30.770 --> 37:31.810
What about Doreen?

37:31.890 --> 37:33.610
Well, she can stay of course, but right now

37:33.690 --> 37:35.570
I need somebody with your experience

37:35.650 --> 37:37.770
mediating between us and the women.

37:38.450 --> 37:40.890
Make sure that they
understand we're not the enemy.

37:43.370 --> 37:44.530
Mmm-hmm?

37:45.690 --> 37:47.250
We thought about doing something for Bea.

37:47.650 --> 37:48.930
Something small.

37:49.490 --> 37:51.170
And the women want to pay their respects.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.690
I think that sounds like a great idea.

37:58.210 --> 38:00.250
Vera, I know you're avoiding me

38:00.930 --> 38:02.930
and I don't want you hating
me for the wrong reason.

38:03.690 --> 38:05.130
Is there a right reason?

38:07.290 --> 38:08.570
You know I used to be in the army.

38:09.810 --> 38:10.850
Yeah.

38:11.250 --> 38:13.050
Well, I served in a
bunch of places, you know.

38:13.130 --> 38:14.250
Peacekeeping missions mostly.

38:14.330 --> 38:15.690
Yes, what has that got to do with anything?

38:15.770 --> 38:16.890
Vera, please.

38:18.570 --> 38:19.730
Just give me a minute, please.

38:28.450 --> 38:29.970
One of the...

38:31.130 --> 38:34.370
Last times was in the East
Timor after the referendum

38:34.930 --> 38:36.050
when things were...

38:37.490 --> 38:38.530
Bad.

38:40.450 --> 38:41.930
And I saw what people could do.

38:45.690 --> 38:48.130
And there was this, uh, family.

38:48.210 --> 38:49.610
A mother and her two kids.

38:50.370 --> 38:51.530
The soldiers stopped them.

38:53.450 --> 38:55.610
They were begging and crying

38:56.490 --> 38:58.010
and the mother tried to hold on to her kids

38:58.090 --> 39:01.050
but her little girl got away and she ran.

39:01.730 --> 39:02.930
And they shot her.

39:07.090 --> 39:08.210
I didn't stop them.

39:10.330 --> 39:12.170
When I heard Bea screaming,

39:14.010 --> 39:16.970
it reminded me of that
mother holding her dead kid.

39:20.130 --> 39:21.290
And I couldn't handle it.

39:24.050 --> 39:25.130
That's terrible.

39:28.410 --> 39:30.610
Most of the time, I can keep a lid on it.

39:31.810 --> 39:32.930
But sometimes I do

39:34.370 --> 39:35.490
things...

39:36.010 --> 39:37.010
You know, like the other night.

39:37.090 --> 39:39.610
It's no excuse and I'm very sorry.

39:40.690 --> 39:41.890
Vera...

39:43.770 --> 39:46.010
I just wanted you to understand.

39:48.890 --> 39:49.970
Thanks.

39:51.610 --> 39:53.370
Do you think you could
let me make it up to you?

39:56.050 --> 39:57.330
Could I have a bit of time?

39:59.810 --> 40:01.410
Yeah, of course.

40:09.890 --> 40:12.690
Ah, that's... That's beautiful, Dor.

40:13.570 --> 40:14.570
It's lovely.

40:15.490 --> 40:16.770
Yeah, thanks.

40:35.210 --> 40:36.290
Are you ready?

40:37.970 --> 40:39.010
Yeah.

41:06.730 --> 41:07.970
Not gonna pay your respects?

41:10.210 --> 41:12.250
I've seen innocent women lose their kids.

41:13.530 --> 41:14.970
Them I feel sorry for, sir.

41:17.050 --> 41:19.490
And I think we shouldn't make
this place easy on the inmates.

41:21.610 --> 41:22.730
Hmm.

41:24.210 --> 41:25.330
You busy tonight?

41:26.250 --> 41:27.250
No plans.

41:28.810 --> 41:29.930
We should have that beer.

41:31.610 --> 41:32.850
Yes, sir.

41:38.850 --> 41:40.170
Thanks for coming, everyone.

41:41.970 --> 41:43.450
Today is for Bea.

41:44.290 --> 41:46.890
To help her say goodbye
to her daughter, Debbie.

41:47.730 --> 41:51.530
You know, being in here, you
get close to the other women.

41:52.890 --> 41:54.970
They're more than friends.
They're your family.

41:56.370 --> 41:58.970
But we never forget the people
on the outside that we love.

42:00.810 --> 42:03.290
And for Bea, that was Debbie.

42:04.930 --> 42:08.330
From the moment Bea came in here,
we could all tell she was a proud mum

42:08.410 --> 42:10.090
and how much she loved her kid.

42:10.690 --> 42:11.850
They were best friends.

42:13.490 --> 42:14.770
They'd talk about everything.

42:21.930 --> 42:23.930
It's all right. It's all right.

42:24.810 --> 42:27.410
Bea, Debbie knew you loved her.

42:27.610 --> 42:29.490
She knew you did your very best for her.

42:30.690 --> 42:34.530
And you have got 16 years
of memories to treasure.

42:35.890 --> 42:37.130
So you're never gonna forget her.

42:37.850 --> 42:38.970
And we won't let you.
