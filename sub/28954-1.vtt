31:42.776 --> 31:46.144
That's his UK mobile.
He has an Indian mobile.

31:46.196 --> 31:47.903
It must be in
my phone but, uh,

31:47.948 --> 31:50.065
I left it in Younganabad.

31:58.917 --> 31:59.917
Hey.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.164
Sir, no smoking here.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.632
Sorry.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.614
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Where are you?

32:33.493 --> 32:34.846
<i>- Sorry, who is this?</i>
- You know who I am.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.578
I'm the person you were supposed
to meet this morning.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.113
Where are you?

32:39.374 --> 32:41.411
<i>Well, I'm s... stuck
in London.</i>

32:41.460 --> 32:45.420
- Why?
<i>- Is everyone okay?</i>

32:46.089 --> 32:48.297
Yeah. What,
why aren't you here?

32:48.425 --> 32:51.463
<i>I'm having to sort out
a lot of things.</i>

32:51.720 --> 32:53.281
What, what the fuck
are you talking about?

32:53.305 --> 32:56.264
<i>Look, I have a ticket.
I'll be in India tomorrow.</i>

32:56.391 --> 32:57.598
<i>I'll meet you in Delhi.</i>

32:57.726 --> 32:59.245
Wha... what do you mean,
"I'll meet you in Delhi?"

32:59.269 --> 33:01.352
You were supposed
to meet me here.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.562
<i>I can't talk right now.</i>

33:03.607 --> 33:06.315
<i>Is the person
you're with okay?</i>

33:06.526 --> 33:09.860
- Yeah, she's good.
<i>- Good. Good.</i>

33:22.918 --> 33:23.999
Hey.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.204
We need to go.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.626
Where?

33:29.674 --> 33:31.836
We're getting on a train
to Delhi.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.376
Deepesh will
meet us there.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.673
Come.

33:51.488 --> 33:53.696
Hey, um, how much
is a ticket for Delhi?

33:54.824 --> 33:55.824
Delhi.

33:57.285 --> 34:00.028
<i>7 a.m.
express train for Delhi</i>

34:00.080 --> 34:01.446
<i>leaving from platform five.</i>

34:01.498 --> 34:03.615
Shit.
Come on.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.454
<i>...the 7 a.m. train
for Delhi.</i>

34:11.508 --> 34:13.875
Hurry. Come.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.212
Move, move, move,
move, move!

34:24.521 --> 34:26.888
Oh, God.
Okay.

34:42.372 --> 34:44.113
How do you know Deepesh?

34:45.458 --> 34:47.040
I never met him.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.836
How much are you
getting paid?

34:56.344 --> 34:59.337
Five up front,
ten on delivery.

35:20.368 --> 35:23.327
In Delhi, we'll share a room,
as man and wife.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.826
Why?

35:26.166 --> 35:27.532
I wanna change name.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.120
I only have one
passport for you.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.377
If we're married,
they'll just look at mine.

35:33.173 --> 35:34.960
And it will save money.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.671
Okay.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.089
Good evening, sir.

36:17.217 --> 36:18.897
- I'd like a room. Double room.
- Yes, sir.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.051
Double room.
Give me passport.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.421
- Sure.
- Only one person?

36:23.556 --> 36:24.717
Us.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.342
Thank you, Mr. Sadik.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.032
Goodnight.

37:07.434 --> 37:10.723
<i>Yo. This is Deepesh and
obviously I'm busy right now.</i>

37:19.571 --> 37:20.857
Hey.

37:20.989 --> 37:24.027
Hey, don't call my UK phone,
alright?

37:24.159 --> 37:25.650
This is my local number.

37:25.785 --> 37:26.821
Where are you?

37:26.953 --> 37:28.694
I'm in Delhi.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.247
Meet me at the
Krishna Hotel in Paharganj

37:31.291 --> 37:32.407
in one hour, okay?

37:32.459 --> 37:34.576
<i>You killed someone.</i>

37:34.627 --> 37:36.243
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

37:36.379 --> 37:37.915
It's in the fucking papers.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.333
It's in the English papers.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.253
Look, man,
he was gonna shoot me.

37:41.301 --> 37:42.337
Or your friend.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.546
Is that Deepesh?

37:43.595 --> 37:45.177
Let me, let,
let me talk to him!

37:45.221 --> 37:47.508
Hello? Deepesh?

37:47.557 --> 37:48.557
Deepesh!

37:48.600 --> 37:50.262
<i>Samira.</i>

37:50.310 --> 37:51.767
Where are you?

37:51.895 --> 37:54.763
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm coming, alright?

37:54.898 --> 37:57.231
What's happening? You were
supposed to be at Amritsar.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.065
<i>I know, I know.
But I'm here.</i>

37:59.194 --> 38:00.651
<i>- Aren't I?</i>
- Where?

38:00.779 --> 38:02.486
<i>I gotta go.
But I will be there.</i>

38:02.530 --> 38:04.237
- No. Deepesh, list...
<i>- Alright? Trust me.</i>

38:04.282 --> 38:05.944
Fuck!

38:06.951 --> 38:08.067
What's going on?

38:08.119 --> 38:09.701
Deepesh is scared.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.783
Stay here.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.412
Do I have any choice?

38:40.276 --> 38:41.892
- I wanna use the internet.
- Yeah.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.860
- The internet.
- Yes.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.783
<i>Hello.</i>

39:38.918 --> 39:41.205
- Nice shirt.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

39:41.337 --> 39:42.953
Walk down the street
to your left.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.330
<i>And then?</i>

39:44.382 --> 39:45.839
Then cross the road
to a restaurant

39:45.884 --> 39:47.045
called Hello Vegetarian.

39:47.176 --> 39:49.088
<i>Okay. I mean...</i>

39:49.137 --> 39:51.129
<i>Why didn't you just say
that in the first place?</i>

39:51.180 --> 39:52.616
Sit with your back
facing the street.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.222
Order me a tea,
I'll be there.

40:02.942 --> 40:03.942
Hey, big man.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.234
Have you got the money?

40:13.286 --> 40:14.286
Yeah.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.621
I'll check it later.
If it's good, I'll call you.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.501
No, it's all there.

40:23.630 --> 40:25.587
I'll arrange a place
for you to meet Samira.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.879
No.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.260
What do you mean?

40:31.304 --> 40:32.840
You killed someone.

40:34.307 --> 40:36.048
It's in the newspapers.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.716
The police are looking
for her.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.538
How long do you think it'll be
before they find us?

40:39.562 --> 40:40.789
You should have thought
about that earlier.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.554
No, you should have done
your fucking job!

40:43.858 --> 40:46.976
It was supposed to be
a random kidnapping.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.519
She disappears.

40:48.905 --> 40:49.736
Right?

40:49.781 --> 40:51.238
Take her back
to Pakistan.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.901
Dump her in Karachi
or Islamabad.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.990
I, I leave it up to you.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.621
Everything goes back
to the way that it was.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.081
That'll be
a lot more work.

41:10.677 --> 41:13.215
Everything's fucking money
for you, isn't it?

41:14.764 --> 41:16.130
Twenty.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.475
I'll give you 20,000.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.604
You got the money here?

41:28.653 --> 41:30.519
No.
But I can get it.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.367
Hey.

41:40.707 --> 41:41.993
Where is he?

41:42.834 --> 41:43.954
He doesn't want
to see you.

41:45.586 --> 41:46.747
What do you mean?

41:47.046 --> 41:48.787
Like I said,
he's scared.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.422
Scared of what?

41:56.848 --> 41:59.076
<i>I'll check it later.
If it's good I'll call you.</i>

41:59.100 --> 42:00.591
<i>No, it's all there.</i>

42:00.643 --> 42:03.101
<i>I'll arrange a place
for you to meet Samira.</i>

42:05.231 --> 42:06.688
<i>No.</i>

42:08.901 --> 42:10.392
<i>What do you mean?</i>

42:10.528 --> 42:12.110
<i>You killed someone.</i>

42:13.239 --> 42:14.855
<i>It's in the newspapers.</i>

42:14.991 --> 42:16.277
<i>The police are
looking for her.</i>

42:16.325 --> 42:18.487
<i>How long do you think it'll be
before they find us?</i>

42:18.536 --> 42:19.888
<i>You should have thought
about that earlier.</i>

42:19.912 --> 42:21.949
<i>No, you should have done
your fucking job!</i>

42:22.707 --> 42:25.791
<i>It was supposed to be
a random kidnapping.</i>

42:25.835 --> 42:27.497
<i>She disappears.</i>

42:27.545 --> 42:30.083
<i>Right?
Take her back to Pakistan.</i>

42:30.131 --> 42:33.715
<i>Dump her in Karachi
or Islamabad.</i>

42:33.760 --> 42:35.126
<i>I, I leave it up to you.</i>

42:35.845 --> 42:38.337
<i>Everything goes back
to the way that it was...</i>

43:05.958 --> 43:07.074
I'm sorry.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.891
Well, you could say
you never saw anyone.

43:29.690 --> 43:30.751
You were dumped
in Pakistan.

43:30.775 --> 43:32.562
You don't know how
you got there.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.422
Maybe they were gonna
ask for a ransom

43:35.446 --> 43:38.814
then they got frightened
so they decided to dump you.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.777
Or I could tell them
that you kidnapped me

43:42.829 --> 43:43.945
give them your description

43:43.996 --> 43:45.783
and tell them that
Deepesh paid you.

43:49.377 --> 43:50.521
You don't think Deepesh
will tell them

43:50.545 --> 43:52.628
you're in on the deal?

43:54.507 --> 43:57.295
So I go back to my family
and get married?

43:59.512 --> 44:00.798
It's up to you.

44:00.847 --> 44:02.713
No, it's not.

44:04.016 --> 44:05.803
That's the whole point.

44:11.941 --> 44:13.523
I'll get you some food.

44:15.736 --> 44:17.102
A whiskey.

44:30.710 --> 44:32.451
Hey, this is Jay.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.624
Hey, Jay!
What's up?

44:34.881 --> 44:36.713
I need some ID, man.

44:36.966 --> 44:38.798
Is it for you?

44:38.926 --> 44:40.417
<i>No, for a girl.</i>

44:40.553 --> 44:41.964
Where are you?
Are you in London?

44:42.096 --> 44:43.928
No, I'm in India.

44:44.056 --> 44:45.592
Is she British?

44:45.725 --> 44:47.182
<i>Indian.</i>

44:47.310 --> 44:48.266
Oh, okay.

44:48.311 --> 44:50.519
I know a guy who could help.
Where are ya?

44:51.272 --> 44:52.683
- Delhi.
<i>- Ah...</i>

44:52.732 --> 44:55.099
<i>He's in Jaipur though.
That a problem?</i>

44:55.359 --> 44:57.316
- Jaipur?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

44:58.154 --> 44:59.270
Okay.

45:05.995 --> 45:08.453
- How much is that?
- 11,500.

45:09.916 --> 45:11.498
Have you got the 20K?

45:11.626 --> 45:13.333
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Alright.

45:13.461 --> 45:15.919
I want you to rent an SUV.
Something smart.

45:16.047 --> 45:17.629
Drive to Jaipur.

45:17.673 --> 45:19.084
Check in at a big hotel.

45:19.133 --> 45:20.715
Something expensive.
A chain.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.092
<i>Wait, why Jaipur?</i>

45:22.136 --> 45:23.422
Just do it.

45:32.855 --> 45:33.855
Hey.

45:33.898 --> 45:35.230
I got you some clothes.

45:36.943 --> 45:38.809
I need you to try
one of those on.

45:40.905 --> 45:41.941
Why?

45:43.950 --> 45:44.950
I need to take a photo.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.199
What for?

45:46.244 --> 45:47.485
For your ID card.

46:07.932 --> 46:09.173
Okay.

46:11.352 --> 46:12.559
Looks good.

46:13.312 --> 46:14.519
Stand there.

46:20.486 --> 46:21.852
You should put
your hair up.

46:30.830 --> 46:32.116
Stand still.

46:37.295 --> 46:38.502
Alright.

46:46.887 --> 46:48.503
Like it?

46:48.639 --> 46:49.800
Yeah.

46:51.100 --> 46:53.308
You wanna get out of here,
get some fresh air?

46:53.686 --> 46:54.847
Yeah.

46:57.023 --> 46:58.355
Do you want
some whiskey?

46:58.399 --> 46:59.435
No.

47:16.375 --> 47:17.957
You're drugging me now?

47:18.753 --> 47:20.540
It's good for stress.

47:20.588 --> 47:22.250
Is that why
you're smoking it?

47:33.184 --> 47:34.550
What was your plan?

47:36.979 --> 47:41.098
Well, Deepesh works
in jewelry.

47:41.400 --> 47:44.234
Gem stones.
That's his family business.

47:44.487 --> 47:46.274
He told his family
that he would go to India

47:46.322 --> 47:48.689
for a retreat
or travel or something.

47:48.741 --> 47:51.825
Basically be out of contact
for six months.

47:52.078 --> 47:54.556
The family keeps the gems in a
vault until they have a customer

47:54.580 --> 47:56.572
and he had access
to the vault.

47:56.707 --> 48:00.075
So he made good copies
of the stones.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.622
I mean, good enough to pass
for real

48:01.754 --> 48:04.212
as long as they're not sold.

48:04.757 --> 48:07.545
The plan was that
he brought them here

48:07.676 --> 48:09.258
and we would disappear.

48:10.763 --> 48:13.130
Live off the money
by selling the stones.

48:16.143 --> 48:17.509
Bold.

48:47.133 --> 48:48.340
Hey.

48:48.467 --> 48:49.753
We need to go.

48:50.177 --> 48:51.543
Where?

48:52.680 --> 48:54.046
Jaipur.

49:14.368 --> 49:15.950
Not bad for 100 rupees.

49:16.745 --> 49:18.486
Looks good.

49:18.622 --> 49:19.829
No?

49:42.938 --> 49:44.895
- Do you guys have Wi-Fi?
- Yes.

49:45.149 --> 49:46.251
I'll take one room,
please?

49:46.275 --> 49:47.686
Can I see your passport,
please?

49:49.904 --> 49:51.270
Thank you, Mr. Sadik.

50:22.978 --> 50:26.437
How many people knew
about you and Deepesh?

50:26.565 --> 50:29.603
No one knew about the plan.
No one I told anyway.

50:29.652 --> 50:32.520
Yeah, but about you and him
being in love?

50:32.655 --> 50:33.715
Our friends knew
about us,

50:33.739 --> 50:36.231
but we kept it a secret
from our family.

50:37.076 --> 50:38.512
Why would they not
want you to marry him?

50:38.536 --> 50:40.027
He's a rich boy.

50:40.079 --> 50:42.412
He's not Muslim.
He's not from Punjab.

50:42.456 --> 50:44.288
He's not from Pakistan.
He's Indian.

50:47.127 --> 50:48.413
Can I see that?

50:54.093 --> 50:56.050
I'm not going back
without seeing him.

51:14.947 --> 51:17.280
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Nitin.

51:17.408 --> 51:19.195
Yeah,
that's me.

51:19.243 --> 51:20.404
Sammy's friend.

51:20.452 --> 51:21.738
Oh, hi.

51:21.870 --> 51:22.701
- Nice to meet you.
- Come in.

51:22.746 --> 51:23.827
Thank you.

51:27.501 --> 51:28.708
Thanks.

51:31.755 --> 51:33.542
How good are they?

51:33.841 --> 51:35.958
See,
the Indian ID's okay.

51:36.010 --> 51:38.297
It is a real person
and she's dead.

51:38.429 --> 51:41.672
Good for hotels, jobs,
police, maybe airlines.

51:42.391 --> 51:43.973
Passport is rough.

51:44.018 --> 51:47.182
Maybe okay for hotels
and traffic cops.

51:47.396 --> 51:48.637
Not for crossing borders?

51:48.689 --> 51:52.148
Mm, maybe by land.

51:52.276 --> 51:55.440
Late at night
with a bribe.

51:56.196 --> 51:58.438
You want a visa
for somewhere?

51:59.116 --> 52:00.527
Pakistan?

52:07.750 --> 52:10.868
Mm, Pakistan...

52:15.424 --> 52:16.631
Yes.

52:17.259 --> 52:19.342
If you, um,
were a rich tourist

52:19.470 --> 52:21.006
wanted to get away
from it all

52:21.055 --> 52:23.047
in a nice hotel near here
where would you go?

52:23.098 --> 52:24.134
Samode.

52:24.266 --> 52:25.848
Very isolated.
Quiet.

52:26.810 --> 52:27.971
You would like it.

52:30.314 --> 52:32.226
- Where are you?
<i>- In Jaipur.</i>

52:32.483 --> 52:35.191
- Do you have the money?
<i>- Yes.</i>

52:35.319 --> 52:37.777
Okay. Pick me up at
the Ghat Gate in 30 minutes.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.403
- What color's your car?
<i>- Black.</i>

52:39.448 --> 52:40.734
<i>Mercedes.</i>

52:55.297 --> 52:57.163
How the fuck
did they get my name?

52:57.299 --> 52:59.006
I guess
they asked someone.

52:59.134 --> 53:01.171
How would they not
get your name?

53:01.303 --> 53:02.794
<i>Have you got the money?</i>

53:06.684 --> 53:07.800
This is only 10k.

53:07.851 --> 53:09.513
Yeah. Half now,
half later.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.894
I'm never gonna see you
after this.

53:12.022 --> 53:12.887
And you don't
want to see me.

53:12.940 --> 53:15.148
So that means
I need all my money now.

53:15.651 --> 53:17.313
Alright. I can get it
by tomorrow.

53:19.154 --> 53:22.318
Good. Book a room
at the Samode Palace.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.066
Your hotel will know it.

53:24.118 --> 53:26.485
- Why?
- Samira wants to see you.

53:27.579 --> 53:29.491
Jesus. No!

53:29.623 --> 53:31.601
She won't go back to Pakistan
unless she's seen you.

53:31.625 --> 53:33.457
No! No.

53:33.502 --> 53:35.619
I need her to cooperate
to get her back there.

53:35.754 --> 53:38.292
You have to see her.
Drop me here.

53:38.424 --> 53:40.632
And be ready to leave your hotel
by 10:00 tomorrow.

53:41.719 --> 53:42.960
And have the money.

53:53.564 --> 53:55.146
Where have you been?

53:55.899 --> 53:57.060
With Deepesh.

53:58.193 --> 53:59.434
He'll see you tomorrow.

54:01.029 --> 54:02.611
This is for you.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.907
What's the plan?

54:10.664 --> 54:12.030
I don't have a plan.

55:23.445 --> 55:25.357
Can we go out
for breakfast?

55:26.114 --> 55:27.321
Sure.

55:28.408 --> 55:29.774
We're leaving anyway.

55:42.881 --> 55:44.213
It's good?

55:44.341 --> 55:45.502
So good.

55:47.386 --> 55:48.752
Have you been
to India before?

55:48.971 --> 55:50.052
Mm.

55:51.390 --> 55:52.676
I love it.

55:53.016 --> 55:54.552
Especially the south.
It's amazing.

55:55.853 --> 55:57.344
Your parents let you
come here?

55:58.355 --> 56:01.314
When I was at uni.
With girlfriends.

56:02.734 --> 56:04.100
What did you study?

56:05.529 --> 56:06.940
Pharmacy.

56:09.616 --> 56:11.073
It's a good solid job.

56:12.995 --> 56:14.361
Then you went off
the rails.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.656
They went crazy first

56:19.793 --> 56:21.409
and then I went crazy,
too.

56:40.022 --> 56:41.388
Get in the front.

56:47.446 --> 56:48.527
Hey, baby.

56:48.572 --> 56:49.938
Where the fuck
have you been?

56:50.073 --> 56:51.273
Well, it's been
a bit tricky.

56:51.325 --> 56:53.032
I've been sorting shit out!

56:53.076 --> 56:54.908
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.

56:56.204 --> 56:57.240
<i>Where are we going?</i>

56:57.289 --> 56:58.450
<i>Samode.</i>

57:03.462 --> 57:04.953
<i>You're looking good,
darling.</i>

57:05.088 --> 57:07.375
This life of crime
suits you.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.715
Bonnie and Clyde shit!

57:09.843 --> 57:10.959
Have you got my money?

57:11.011 --> 57:12.343
Jesus Christ!

57:12.387 --> 57:14.504
You are like
a stuck record, man.

57:14.556 --> 57:16.718
Yeah, I got your money.

57:17.184 --> 57:18.800
Can we talk in private?

57:21.063 --> 57:22.429
Sure.

57:22.564 --> 57:23.850
Pull over here.

57:24.900 --> 57:25.900
No.

57:27.945 --> 57:29.652
I said pull over now.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.237
- Now! Come on!
- Alright, alright.

57:39.289 --> 57:40.450
Give me the money.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.374
Money, money,
money, money.

57:46.755 --> 57:48.212
Take it.

57:50.467 --> 57:52.834
I'll leave you two lovebirds
alone for a minute.

57:56.014 --> 57:57.971
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

57:58.433 --> 58:00.140
<i>Do you think I don't know
what's going on?</i>

58:00.185 --> 58:01.996
<i>Do you think I don't know what
you've been saying to him?</i>

58:02.020 --> 58:03.852
<i>What shit has
he been feeding you?</i>

58:03.897 --> 58:04.933
<i>Oh. I know you.</i>

58:04.982 --> 58:07.315
<i>I know you're
bullshitting me, okay?</i>

58:08.360 --> 58:10.101
<i>- You need to go back.
- No. No.</i>

58:10.153 --> 58:13.066
<i>Yeah, you do.
Police are looking for me.</i>

58:13.115 --> 58:14.322
<i>- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.</i>

58:14.366 --> 58:15.573
<i>Serves you right!</i>

58:15.617 --> 58:16.617
<i>- Serves me right?
- Yeah.</i>

58:16.660 --> 58:18.117
<i>What did you think?</i>

58:18.161 --> 58:19.777
<i>I get kidnapped
and no one would notice?</i>

58:19.830 --> 58:20.445
<i>No one would bother,</i>

58:20.497 --> 58:22.784
<i>like it's some
stupid student prank?</i>

58:22.833 --> 58:25.120
<i>I just didn't think he was
gonna fuckin' kill someone!</i>

58:25.168 --> 58:26.204
<i>That's not my fault.</i>

58:26.253 --> 58:27.915
<i>That's not my fault,
either.</i>

58:27.963 --> 58:29.044
<i>You stupid fuck!</i>

58:29.089 --> 58:31.832
Motherfucker! Motherfucker!

58:31.883 --> 58:33.683
<i>And paying extra to send me
back to Pakistan</i>

58:33.719 --> 58:34.630
<i>to that fucking marriage,</i>

58:34.678 --> 58:36.635
<i>like I'm some lost
fucking luggage!</i>

58:36.680 --> 58:38.342
I'll fucking kill you!

58:38.473 --> 58:39.701
- Don't fucking...
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

58:39.725 --> 58:41.261
Don't fucking touch me!

58:41.393 --> 58:42.600
Cut it out!
You dumb...

58:42.644 --> 58:45.227
Hey! Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

58:46.773 --> 58:48.264
Alright!

58:48.400 --> 58:50.312
Shut the fuck up.
Walk, man!

58:52.571 --> 58:54.483
- She's fucking crazy.
- Shut the fuck up.

58:54.531 --> 58:57.319
She's fucking crazy,
alright?

58:57.451 --> 58:59.033
Where are the jewels?

58:59.077 --> 59:00.534
- What jewels?
- The stones.

59:00.662 --> 59:02.574
What fucking stones?

59:03.206 --> 59:04.663
Is that what
she fucking told you?

59:05.083 --> 59:05.869
And you believed her?

59:05.917 --> 59:08.000
Man, you are dumber
than I thought.

59:08.045 --> 59:09.502
I thought you loved her.

59:09.546 --> 59:12.209
She's a fucking snake!

59:13.050 --> 59:16.794
Come on. She's pulling
crazy stunts.

59:16.845 --> 59:18.632
I liked it.
It's exciting.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.922
But she always
has got an angle.

59:20.974 --> 59:23.808
Sounds like I shouldn't take
her back to Pakistan then, huh?

59:23.935 --> 59:25.221
Too much trouble.

59:25.270 --> 59:26.226
You took the money.

59:32.152 --> 59:33.233
Fuckin'...

59:49.961 --> 59:51.668
Fuck.

59:52.005 --> 59:53.291
Fuck!

59:55.842 --> 59:57.174
Fuck!

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:22.275
Is he dead?

1:00:24.621 --> 1:00:25.621
Yeah.

1:00:27.415 --> 1:00:28.951
Are you gonna kill me?

1:00:30.502 --> 1:00:31.743
I should.

1:00:35.507 --> 1:00:36.998
Can I trust you?

1:00:38.510 --> 1:00:39.671
No.

1:00:49.771 --> 1:00:51.228
Here's the deal,
yeah.

1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:56.358
We split the jewels 50-50,

1:00:58.113 --> 1:00:59.900
get rid of Deepesh

1:01:01.241 --> 1:01:03.028
and go our separate ways.

1:01:06.997 --> 1:01:08.078
Okay.

1:01:56.671 --> 1:01:57.671
Let me see.

1:02:02.385 --> 1:02:03.501
What's the plan?

1:02:04.846 --> 1:02:06.553
We could put him
in the car.

1:02:06.598 --> 1:02:08.055
Drive it off the road
somewhere.

1:02:08.099 --> 1:02:09.431
It will look like
an accident.

1:02:12.896 --> 1:02:14.432
They'll be still
looking for me.

1:02:18.568 --> 1:02:20.025
You got his passport?

1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:21.731
It's in the car.

1:03:03.947 --> 1:03:05.188
I'm gonna get us
some petrol.

1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:06.526
You wait here.

1:03:06.741 --> 1:03:08.323
Give me my bag.

1:03:26.594 --> 1:03:29.177
Nitin.
Sammy's friend.

1:03:30.849 --> 1:03:32.340
Yeah, I have
something for you.

1:03:45.363 --> 1:03:46.399
How much is this?

1:05:28.133 --> 1:05:29.340
Where are we going?

1:05:29.467 --> 1:05:31.427
We're gonna stay the night
at the Samode Palace.

1:05:32.011 --> 1:05:33.297
I'll be Deepesh.

1:05:33.430 --> 1:05:35.171
We'll let people know
we're going to Nepal.

1:05:35.557 --> 1:05:37.344
Then we'll head
south instead.

1:05:53.825 --> 1:05:55.566
Good evening, sir.
Please have a seat.

1:05:55.702 --> 1:05:56.702
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:05:56.744 --> 1:05:58.906
<i>I have a booking.
Deepesh Nair.</i>

1:05:58.955 --> 1:06:00.321
May I have your
passport please?

1:06:00.373 --> 1:06:01.580
Yeah, sure.

1:06:11.176 --> 1:06:12.758
<i>I'm going to the pool.</i>

1:06:15.555 --> 1:06:16.796
Okay.

1:06:32.530 --> 1:06:34.487
- Evening.
- Hi. Good evening, sir.

1:06:34.532 --> 1:06:35.676
- How can I help you?
- You mind if I look at a map?

1:06:35.700 --> 1:06:37.066
- Yes, please.
- Thank you.

1:06:47.212 --> 1:06:50.501
If you could show me
the best route to Nepal.

1:06:50.632 --> 1:06:51.873
Where about in Nepal?

1:06:51.925 --> 1:06:53.416
- Kathmandu.
- Oh, right.

1:07:02.685 --> 1:07:05.177
<i>Hello, can I help you?</i>

1:07:05.230 --> 1:07:07.222
Hi, can I have
a sewing kit, please?

1:07:07.273 --> 1:07:08.459
<i>There should be one
in your room.</i>

1:07:08.483 --> 1:07:10.349
Where in the room?

1:07:10.485 --> 1:07:11.692
And to get down
to Kathmandu

1:07:11.736 --> 1:07:13.853
you have to go
through Lucknow.

1:07:20.537 --> 1:07:22.324
I got it, thank you!

1:07:23.790 --> 1:07:26.624
Oh, no, thanks,
I'll do it. Thanks.

1:08:10.086 --> 1:08:10.746
I bought a costume,

1:08:10.795 --> 1:08:13.754
I thought we should look like
we're on holiday together.

1:10:05.451 --> 1:10:06.942
Where are you going?

1:10:08.621 --> 1:10:09.782
It's time to leave.

1:10:28.850 --> 1:10:30.637
Where are we going today?

1:10:31.185 --> 1:10:32.517
First stop, Jaipur.

1:10:32.645 --> 1:10:33.886
Then on to Goa.

1:10:52.123 --> 1:10:53.659
You should stay here.
I won't be long.

1:10:53.708 --> 1:10:55.165
No, I'm coming with you.

1:10:59.046 --> 1:11:00.582
How much can I get
for the car?

1:11:00.631 --> 1:11:02.213
Thousand dollars.

1:11:03.801 --> 1:11:08.421
And you can have these...
for free.

1:11:09.515 --> 1:11:12.053
But they need
to be used first in Delhi.

1:11:12.101 --> 1:11:13.741
Then send them to Lucknow.
Use them there.

1:11:13.770 --> 1:11:15.762
Then Kathmandu.
Then finish. Okay?

1:11:15.897 --> 1:11:18.981
Okay.
Deepesh Nair, hm?

1:11:19.108 --> 1:11:20.644
And I have a stone.

1:11:20.693 --> 1:11:23.106
We have a stone
that we need to sell.

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:26.022
It's good.
- I know a person.

1:11:26.407 --> 1:11:28.364
Uh, hold on.
Can we talk?

1:11:29.118 --> 1:11:31.360
<i>- Okay. I'll leave you.</i>
- Thanks.

1:11:31.496 --> 1:11:33.988
I need to make
some calls.

1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:37.204
Uh, where's the car?

1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:40.168
It's in the street just
outside the Bank of India.

1:11:51.390 --> 1:11:52.451
Why are we selling
the stones?

1:11:52.475 --> 1:11:55.218
One stone.
We need money to live on.

1:11:56.979 --> 1:11:58.971
What about
the car money?

1:11:59.106 --> 1:12:00.893
A thousand dollars?

1:12:02.068 --> 1:12:04.025
- Who is this guy?
- He's good.

1:12:04.153 --> 1:12:05.314
He's good.

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:08.067
Have you got the stone?

1:12:11.077 --> 1:12:12.443
Yeah.

1:12:25.049 --> 1:12:26.049
Thank you.

1:12:38.938 --> 1:12:40.520
Yes, ma'am.
Just give it.

1:12:41.691 --> 1:12:43.353
Ooh, it's diamond.

1:13:14.098 --> 1:13:15.134
Oh...

1:13:17.685 --> 1:13:19.301
It's too rich
piece for me.

1:13:29.864 --> 1:13:30.820
What's he saying?

1:13:30.865 --> 1:13:32.948
<i>He said he...
he don't have</i>

1:13:32.992 --> 1:13:34.449
<i>a buyer for this.</i>

1:13:34.577 --> 1:13:37.445
It's more than $100,000.

1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:39.196
I don't have
any buyer for this.

1:13:39.248 --> 1:13:40.455
Okay, thank you.

1:13:41.334 --> 1:13:42.700
Take carefully.

1:13:43.210 --> 1:13:44.701
Thank you.

1:13:44.837 --> 1:13:45.953
Just a minute.

1:14:05.274 --> 1:14:06.810
Where did you hide
the diamonds?

1:14:06.943 --> 1:14:08.809
In your dress
or your jacket?

1:14:08.945 --> 1:14:10.061
Guess.

1:14:10.529 --> 1:14:11.565
Dress.

1:14:11.697 --> 1:14:13.188
Correct.

1:14:13.407 --> 1:14:14.523
Where?

1:14:15.076 --> 1:14:16.612
Try and find them.

1:14:19.497 --> 1:14:20.738
Cold.

1:14:22.416 --> 1:14:23.873
Very cold.

1:14:31.759 --> 1:14:33.125
Hot.

1:14:33.844 --> 1:14:35.961
Don't you think we should
put them somewhere safer?

1:14:36.097 --> 1:14:37.097
Like where?

1:14:38.975 --> 1:14:40.056
My wallet?

1:14:41.727 --> 1:14:43.309
You might lose it.

1:14:43.604 --> 1:14:45.561
I won't lose my dress.

1:14:46.232 --> 1:14:47.417
Easy for you
to keep an eye on it.

1:14:47.441 --> 1:14:49.103
It's bright yellow.

1:14:49.610 --> 1:14:51.602
You'll notice
if I take it off.

1:15:09.964 --> 1:15:10.964
Look.

1:15:17.513 --> 1:15:19.004
Good plan.

1:15:21.684 --> 1:15:24.121
<i>I have contacted
the British Consulate in Pakistan</i>

1:15:24.145 --> 1:15:27.309
<i>and I have requested them
to get involved.</i>

1:15:30.192 --> 1:15:31.979
Sounds like
he wants you back.

1:15:34.905 --> 1:15:36.271
I'm never going back.

1:15:41.078 --> 1:15:43.195
How old were you
when you left Pakistan?

1:15:47.835 --> 1:15:49.121
I was 12.

1:15:50.379 --> 1:15:51.745
Must have been tough.

1:15:53.382 --> 1:15:55.089
Things were okay
in Pakistan.

1:15:56.802 --> 1:15:57.946
It was only when
we got to England

1:15:57.970 --> 1:15:59.757
that it all went wrong.

1:16:15.821 --> 1:16:17.528
Listen,
can I have some money?

1:16:17.573 --> 1:16:18.859
Why?

1:16:18.908 --> 1:16:20.524
I want to buy
a phone.

1:16:20.868 --> 1:16:22.450
How much will it be?

1:16:24.747 --> 1:16:26.488
If you just give me
the 500 from the car.

1:16:29.877 --> 1:16:32.210
- If you need ID, use that.
- Thanks.

1:16:33.047 --> 1:16:35.209
Can I also have my
British passport?

1:16:36.008 --> 1:16:38.125
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna run away.

1:17:06.163 --> 1:17:07.495
Where are we?

1:17:09.125 --> 1:17:10.366
I don't know.

1:17:11.836 --> 1:17:13.122
We've got about
eight more hours

1:17:13.170 --> 1:17:15.036
before we get to Goa.

1:17:19.426 --> 1:17:21.383
India's so huge.

1:17:21.846 --> 1:17:23.587
So full of people.

1:17:24.181 --> 1:17:26.389
A thousand million.

1:17:27.059 --> 1:17:29.722
Everyone living their own life
in their own world.

1:17:33.899 --> 1:17:36.141
It's the perfect place
to get lost.

1:17:38.737 --> 1:17:41.150
We're like two needles
in our Indian haystack.

1:18:13.397 --> 1:18:15.263
- I'm starving.
- Yeah.

1:18:15.316 --> 1:18:16.807
Can we get
something to eat?

1:18:16.859 --> 1:18:18.725
Yeah. You stay here,
I'm gonna go rent a car.

1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:24.276
- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

1:18:24.408 --> 1:18:25.740
Uh, I'd like
to rent a jeep.

1:18:25.784 --> 1:18:27.179
<i>Mm, how long would
you like it for?</i>

1:18:27.203 --> 1:18:29.911
Two weeks.
But I, I might extend it.

1:18:30.039 --> 1:18:30.825
Not a problem.

1:18:30.873 --> 1:18:31.829
Can I have a license,
please?

1:18:31.874 --> 1:18:32.910
Sure.

1:18:34.501 --> 1:18:35.617
Thank you.

1:18:39.423 --> 1:18:41.756
Okay.
So who are you today?

1:18:42.092 --> 1:18:43.549
Jatinder Shah.

1:18:43.677 --> 1:18:45.794
Correct answer.
That's a new one.

1:18:45.846 --> 1:18:46.882
Yeah.

1:18:51.185 --> 1:18:53.802
I can't wait to go
to the ocean to swim.

1:18:54.939 --> 1:18:56.896
We could go diving.
I love diving.

1:18:57.024 --> 1:18:59.687
- I have a confession.
- What?

1:19:00.069 --> 1:19:01.105
I can't swim.

1:19:01.904 --> 1:19:03.111
No.

1:19:03.155 --> 1:19:04.521
- Yeah.
- No.

1:19:05.908 --> 1:19:07.365
Really?

1:19:07.493 --> 1:19:09.860
- You can teach me though.
- Yeah, I will teach you.

1:19:09.912 --> 1:19:11.192
Yeah,
I'll teach you how to swim.

1:19:15.668 --> 1:19:17.955
- Hi.
- Hi, thank you.

1:19:18.087 --> 1:19:20.454
Avocado salad
and your omelet.

1:19:20.589 --> 1:19:21.942
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

1:19:21.966 --> 1:19:24.583
Um, we're looking for
somewhere to stay.

1:19:24.635 --> 1:19:26.217
Where's the best
place to start?

1:19:26.262 --> 1:19:27.628
For how long?

1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:29.763
I don't know.
The, the winter maybe.

1:19:29.807 --> 1:19:31.117
If you're looking
for long term,

1:19:31.141 --> 1:19:32.928
Maria has a lot.

1:19:32.977 --> 1:19:34.889
In the jewelry shop
down there by the beach.

1:19:34.937 --> 1:19:37.304
- Oh.
- But minimum three months.

1:19:37.356 --> 1:19:38.642
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1:19:41.277 --> 1:19:43.064
That sounds perfect.

1:19:44.363 --> 1:19:45.729
Mm. Want some?

1:19:49.034 --> 1:19:50.150
Mm, it's good.

1:20:09.054 --> 1:20:10.636
- Auntie.
- Hey.

1:20:11.098 --> 1:20:12.534
Can I have the keys?
They've come to see the house.

1:20:12.558 --> 1:20:14.641
- Here.
- Thank you.

1:20:18.105 --> 1:20:20.848
Yes, so come in.

1:20:22.401 --> 1:20:24.108
Have a nice view from here.

1:20:26.530 --> 1:20:29.113
That's your dining place.

1:20:29.700 --> 1:20:30.736
That's the kitchen.

1:20:33.912 --> 1:20:35.744
And these are your keys.
- Thank you.

1:20:35.873 --> 1:20:37.330
If you need anything,
I'm here.

1:20:37.374 --> 1:20:38.535
Have a nice day.

1:20:38.584 --> 1:20:40.371
- Thank you very much.
- Bye. See you around.

1:21:38.519 --> 1:21:39.930
Come on,
I'll bite you.

1:21:50.656 --> 1:21:52.022
Does it hurt?

1:22:03.710 --> 1:22:04.951
What's your real name?

1:22:13.512 --> 1:22:14.878
Asif.

1:22:22.604 --> 1:22:23.970
No, it's not.

1:23:06.064 --> 1:23:07.225
Huh?

1:23:09.693 --> 1:23:10.809
- Look out!
- Oh, fuck!

1:23:10.861 --> 1:23:13.103
Shit! Don't!
Don't do that!

1:23:31.632 --> 1:23:34.215
Are you coming swimming with me?
I can teach you.

1:23:34.384 --> 1:23:37.627
- Tomorrow. Promise.
- Okay. Tomorrow.

1:23:45.395 --> 1:23:47.182
Come on!
- I would, but...

1:26:48.203 --> 1:26:49.203
Samira?

1:26:59.589 --> 1:27:00.589
Samira?

1:28:09.534 --> 1:28:10.534
Samira!

1:28:18.585 --> 1:28:19.585
Samira!

1:28:24.549 --> 1:28:25.915
Excuse me.

1:28:28.887 --> 1:28:30.469
How much is that?
- 35.

1:28:57.791 --> 1:28:58.791
Hello?

1:29:00.669 --> 1:29:01.830
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:29:04.548 --> 1:29:05.709
Are you?

1:29:07.467 --> 1:29:10.926
<i>You can go back.
No one knows who you are.</i>

1:29:11.638 --> 1:29:12.674
<i>I can't.</i>

1:29:20.146 --> 1:29:21.933
Thanks for the
five grand.

1:29:24.860 --> 1:29:26.442
<i>I'll miss you.</i>

1:29:31.992 --> 1:29:33.984
