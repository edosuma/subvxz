WEBVTT

00:11.640 --> 00:13.640
Sandy!

00:14.480 --> 00:16.720
Sandy, where are you?

00:16.840 --> 00:19.200
Jesus Christ, Zoe.
You're chewing on the furniture.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.280
Why don't you just bring it down a little?

00:21.280 --> 00:25.120
Oh, I'm sorry that I didn't brush up
on my Stanislavski to convincingly search

00:25.120 --> 00:27.440
for somebody that we know
isn't fucking here.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.360
I found something!

00:34.560 --> 00:36.840
Feces, human feces.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.760
Sandy must be hiding out
somewhere in the school,

00:39.880 --> 00:42.360
then coming down here to go number two.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.000
Sorry to break it to you, Pepé,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.480
but this is where we've all been going
number two since the plumbing died.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.880
Wait. Where have you been going?

00:55.400 --> 00:58.040
Oh, my God, she hasn't.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.200
- Okay, I think we're done here.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.560
Absolutely.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.920
In the words of that Scottish mother
from YouTube, disgusting!

01:04.920 --> 01:06.840
No, I mean, I think we're done
looking for Sandy.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.720
Obviously, we have bigger priorities now,
like fucking toilets.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.760
No way.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.280
If we're willing to abandon our humanity
one week in to give up on one of our own,

01:15.400 --> 01:17.640
then we might as well skip
straight to eating someone.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.280
- What the fuck?

01:19.920 --> 01:23.240
But, Pepé,
we've been looking for a whole week.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.760
And you heard Sandy.
She fucking hated it here.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.240
A row boat is missing.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.760
We can't find her bag.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.200
And we all know she'd never
leave without her fucking bag, right?

01:31.200 --> 01:33.280
Yeah, and also all the poos
are accounted for.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.720
- But we need to...
- We need to get the radio working.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.640
Figure out which berries are safe to eat.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.480
Find a way to get all of our IUDs out
before they rot away in our uteruses.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.280
We need to start planning ahead,

01:44.280 --> 01:47.160
and that means finding a way
to live up here.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.000
Permanently.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.960
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, it's okay.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.080
I know we're worried about Sandy,
but I'm sure she's fine.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.920
Halfway to being reunited
with Constable by now.

02:06.920 --> 02:11.160
We're not worried about Sandy, okay?
We're worried about our family

02:11.160 --> 02:12.600
- and our friends and...
- Our bongs.

02:12.720 --> 02:16.360
If we just start focusing on survival now,
aren't we just giving up on everyone?

02:16.360 --> 02:17.520
Exactly.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.320
And that is why I, for one,
refuse to stop looking for Sandy,

02:21.320 --> 02:23.600
because I, for one, refuse to believe

02:23.720 --> 02:25.840
that no one else is out there
looking for us, too.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.880
I mean, they have to be.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.120
Right?

02:32.960 --> 02:35.520
Look, this shit is hard. I get it.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.960
We're not meant to be okay.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.840
Which is why, starting now,

02:43.280 --> 02:47.240
I'm introducing a mandatory
emotional release hour.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.840
<i>Do whatever you need to do
to work through the pain</i>

02:50.840 --> 02:52.600
<i>and the worry and the grief.</i>

02:56.280 --> 02:58.640
<i>Because nothing could have
prepared us for this.</i>

02:58.640 --> 03:02.600
<i>No amount of meditation
or medication or self-care.</i>

03:02.600 --> 03:03.920
<i>-</i> [Tegan] <i>Breathe in.</i>

03:04.840 --> 03:08.440
<i>So, please, just give yourself
permission to fall apart...</i>

03:08.720 --> 03:10.840
- Breathe out.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.080
<i>...for one whole hour a day.</i>

03:18.400 --> 03:20.240
<i>I'm urging you to cry,</i>

03:20.560 --> 03:24.160
<i>sob, howl at the moon. I don't care.</i>

03:27.240 --> 03:29.080
<i>We will get our shit together.</i>

03:29.800 --> 03:33.000
<i>We'll deploy all our strengths
until we master the basics</i>

03:33.000 --> 03:35.600
<i>of food, water, plumbing and power.</i>

03:36.640 --> 03:37.840
Occupied.

03:39.760 --> 03:44.080
<i>But don't for a second
underestimate the pain of being back here.</i>

03:46.600 --> 03:49.760
<i>All our teenage baggage
has floated to the surface,</i>

03:49.760 --> 03:52.520
<i>and now we're stuck
with the people we thought</i>

03:52.520 --> 03:54.320
<i>we'd know forever</i>

03:54.320 --> 03:58.120
<i>until, you know, boys and jobs and
forks in the road got in the way.</i>

04:02.280 --> 04:07.160
<i>So, for all our sakes,
get over your shit and let it out,</i>

04:09.280 --> 04:10.680
<i>because if we don't,</i>

04:11.200 --> 04:14.560
<i>I promise you, we'll never survive this.</i>

04:17.240 --> 04:20.880
This is a very
difficult situation, Amelia.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.040
I don't imagine you'll be
returning to the school.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.720
Your father has arranged for you
to return home to the property

04:29.720 --> 04:30.880
on the 3:00 p.m. train.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.720
I'll allow another girl
to help you pack up your dorm room.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.800
Zoe, perhaps?

04:37.640 --> 04:38.760
Oh.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.880
We're not really friends any more.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.240
So, what unique qualifications
can you bring to the survival effort?

04:52.360 --> 04:55.040
I actually started in paediatrics
because I love kids.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.200
And then I was promoted to the ER, stat.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.800
Stat, it's a medical term for "fast."

05:01.160 --> 05:03.200
As in, uh, "I need lunch, stat."

05:03.920 --> 05:05.360
Just kidding.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.800
But seriously, is lunch soon or...

05:06.920 --> 05:08.920
- You had ducks, correct?
-  Yeah.

05:08.920 --> 05:13.120
I also had an investment portfolio
totalling 17 mil in diversified crypto.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.360
But now that legumes are trading
at an all-time high,

05:16.360 --> 05:18.800
I'm cashing in, baby. Fuck's sake.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.160
- I've worked for several years as a...
-  Teresa!

05:22.880 --> 05:25.880
I could really go for a tea right now.
Could you grab me one?

05:27.240 --> 05:29.960
Caretaker school captain,
homeroom coordinator,

05:29.960 --> 05:32.640
uh, student delegate
to the Uniform Committee.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.640
If it weren't for me,

05:33.640 --> 05:36.240
this school would never have
brought back the winter berets.

05:36.240 --> 05:39.320
So you printed these off
and brought them to the reunion?

05:40.960 --> 05:42.240
And what industry did you work in?

05:42.240 --> 05:43.880
Marketing.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.320
Great.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.520
Beer. I made beer for living.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.160
Oh, so you must know some chemistry then.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.520
I know that you can't put a flat beer
in a SodaStream bottle

05:51.520 --> 05:52.920
and try to put bubbles back in it

05:52.920 --> 05:55.400
unless you want it to ricochet
out the window, Saskia.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.120
- As I was saying, I've worked as a...

05:57.120 --> 05:59.200
Too hot, Teresa. Too hot.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.160
And that's what 10,000 hours gets ya.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.120
Third chair in the
Australian Symphony Orchestra

06:13.120 --> 06:14.120
and not much else?

06:14.480 --> 06:17.200
I farm...

06:17.760 --> 06:18.720
peanuts.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.720
Don't worry, Amelia.
I've got big plans for you.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.760
All right, ladies, listen up.
You've been split into two groups.

06:28.760 --> 06:32.960
On the right, we have the Innovation
and Research Division, led by Amelia,

06:32.960 --> 06:36.880
and they will be tasked with finding a way
to generate electricity by tonight.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.760
-  And on the stairs,

06:38.760 --> 06:40.840
we have the Infrastructure team.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.800
You guys are gonna be digging
long-drop toilets.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.760
What? Nerds and gronks, basically.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.880
Well, I'm going to be earning my bowl
of rice tonight by digging long-drops.

06:49.880 --> 06:53.520
And Teresa remains on food,
and Zoe is your student council rep.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.520
- "Too cools" privilege continues.
- Sluts.

06:58.520 --> 07:02.480
Guys, if you've got questions, suggestions
or concerns about your allocation,

07:02.480 --> 07:04.960
like I just said,
Zoe is your student council rep.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.200
You can take it up with her.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.000
Uh, uh...

07:08.000 --> 07:10.280
Yeah, hit me up, gal pals.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.880
Yeah, I got a quezzie.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.800
How is it that this school
feeds 800 girls a day,

07:14.800 --> 07:17.880
but after one week,
all we have left to eat is rice?

07:17.880 --> 07:20.720
- Yeah. What the fuck?
- I hardcore second that.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.440
- Who thirds it?
- Yo.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.920
How are you going to stop 100%

07:24.920 --> 07:27.400
of hungry bitches
from dying of starvation,

07:27.400 --> 07:28.440
Zoe?

07:28.440 --> 07:31.200
Is that a question?
It kind of sounds more like a comment.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.960
Yeah, how come she's getting
preferential treatment,

07:32.960 --> 07:34.480
even though it's her fault
that we're stuck here?

07:34.480 --> 07:36.600
Kind of like how it's your fault

07:36.600 --> 07:39.840
for draining the generators last week,
Phoebe, charging your little laptop.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.920
-  Nerd.
-  And, Tegan,

07:41.920 --> 07:45.680
I saw you sneak a spoonful of rice out
of Unremarkable Lisa's bowl last night.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.120
It's Forgettable Laura.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.320
- Sorry, what?
-  And, Renee,

07:49.320 --> 07:51.160
I know you're hiding a menstrual cup
in there.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.640
We could all be using that.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.000
Sorry.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.120
- Zoe...
- Oh, I don't...

07:59.600 --> 08:02.360
I think, I think we're good.
I think we've got the message, Sas.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.400
Great.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.280
Look, I know that you're all hungry,
but I do see your strengths.

08:07.960 --> 08:12.040
And if there's a group of women
who can succeed at surviving, it's us.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.680
- So let's get to work, okay?
- Whoo!

08:15.880 --> 08:18.680
No! No, no, no.

08:18.680 --> 08:22.400
Under no circumstances
could I be considered a gronk.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.480
I refuse to dig long-drop toilets.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.000
Fuck your allocations.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.400
I'm looking for Sandy.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.040
<i>"Qui quaerit, invenit."</i>

08:33.520 --> 08:35.760
He who seeks, finds.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.880
I lobbied hard for the committee
to make it,

08:37.880 --> 08:39.880
"She who seeks finds,"
but it didn't translate as well.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.640
Sounds like somebody failed
to emotionally release last night.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.880
What?

08:47.840 --> 08:49.520
Like, as in she hasn't taken a shit yet.

08:49.640 --> 08:50.520
Oh, good one.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.120
Okay, look, Sandy's story needs an ending.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.000
I need you to convince Genevieve

09:00.000 --> 09:02.760
that Sandy was lost and bereft
without her mutt.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.520
She found her bag and she fucked off.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.080
End of story. You got it?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.360
- But how?
- "Yeah, Saskia, I've got it."

09:09.360 --> 09:10.360
Thank you.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.720
Dear bitches,

09:17.440 --> 09:22.480
have gone back...

09:23.520 --> 09:27.320
to States.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.520
Hi, mate.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.520
What you doing?

09:41.520 --> 09:43.400
Need any help with, um...

09:45.000 --> 09:46.360
Dewey Decimal System?

09:48.600 --> 09:52.640
612 is where you'll find pictures
of dicks in anatomy textbooks.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.160
- Don't ask me how I know that.
- Nope. I'm good.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.600
You can go back
to pretending to do something.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.640
My job is to help you, friend.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.200
Bit above your reading level,
don't you think?

10:09.480 --> 10:10.760
Cool, cool, cool. Uh...

10:10.880 --> 10:13.960
Well, I'm here if you need anything.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.880
Just like in netball.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.400
Here if you need wing defence.
JK, wing defence never got the ball.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.760
Hey, where are you going?

10:20.440 --> 10:21.640
Oh, Zoe.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.760
I shan't hold my breath for your help.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.640
Wait, what?

10:33.840 --> 10:35.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.760
I was just...

10:36.760 --> 10:38.080
Tuck shop, anyone?

10:38.080 --> 10:41.280
- Yes. You wanna come?
- Oh. No, that's okay.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.840
But if you don't mind waiting...

10:43.840 --> 10:46.280
- a sec...
-  Zo-Zo. Come on, let's go.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.320
Zoe, I really need to talk...

10:51.320 --> 10:52.720
Zo-Zo, let's go.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.320
Amelia, please come.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.760
We haven't hung out in ages.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.600
Uh, no. Go without me.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.520
I need to see Danny anyway.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.120
See?
She doesn't have time for you, Zoe.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.320
Guys, little help.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.200
Come on, Phoebe. You used to memorize
this shit in your sleep.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.680
Um...

11:16.680 --> 11:19.360
<i>♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪</i>

11:19.800 --> 11:22.600
<i>♪ Power equals I squared R ♪</i>

11:22.880 --> 11:26.000
And the "I" means ice cream.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.360
And the "R" is ratatouille or some shit.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.160
I can't think. I'm so fucking hungry.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.640
Soz.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.760
Guys, how good does that rat look?

11:38.840 --> 11:41.640
I could go some deep fried rat
right about now.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.440
Samesies.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.640
Doc, what's that yellow stuff?

11:49.080 --> 11:50.560
Oh! Me.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.800
Um...

11:51.800 --> 11:53.920
That's... It's pickle juice.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.640
I thought it was formaldehyde.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.640
Common misconception, Phoebe.

11:57.640 --> 12:01.800
Um, yeah, they, they phased out
the forda-del-dulcimide.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.040
- It's actually all organic now.
- Guys!

12:04.040 --> 12:06.080
Please, just help me work this out.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.240
But how are we supposed to focus with only
a few mouthfuls of rice in our bellies?

12:09.240 --> 12:13.480
I'm so hungry. At least when we were
cramming for school, like, we had, like,

12:13.480 --> 12:15.960
energy drinks and, like, finger buns.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.640
- Let's talk about finger buns.
- Burger Rings.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.440
- Vegemite scrolls.
- Vegemite scrolls.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.240
- Icy poles, the long ones.
- Yes.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.160
- Hello!
- Okay, okay. I get it. I get it.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.480
I will find us some food.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.080
Just, please...

12:30.880 --> 12:31.960
get to work?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.000
Yes, queens.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.280
You boss bitches go.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.920
All right. Now, this is the standard.
Everybody, I want you to look at, um...

12:40.760 --> 12:42.160
At her hole.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.240
Sarah K., come on,
I know you got more in you than that.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.600
Nice work, ladies.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.440
This bitch gonna actually dig or
just hold a shovel and say positive shit?

12:51.440 --> 12:53.480
Damn, why does she look so good?

12:53.480 --> 12:55.920
I couldn't find anything
in the boarders' wardrobes that fit.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.800
Sandy!

13:01.240 --> 13:03.560
Sandy!

13:04.840 --> 13:07.080
I don't think we're gonna
have this cracked by tonight.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.280
We're all pretty rusty
on the book learning front,

13:10.280 --> 13:12.640
and we're just too hungry to focus.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.040
Okay, take your time.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.880
But just know, you and your team won't
be eating till you generate electricity.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.080
What?

13:21.160 --> 13:24.040
Saskia, that's no way
to motivate people, through...

13:24.960 --> 13:26.680
threats and ultimatums?

13:26.680 --> 13:28.720
Well, Amelia, this is how I lead.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.880
And, if I recall correctly,
you were the one who so badly

13:30.880 --> 13:32.560
wanted me back in this position.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.360
"Don't overthink it," you said.
"We just need a bitch."

13:36.200 --> 13:37.120
So here I am.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.840
Run things how you want,

13:41.840 --> 13:43.880
but I won't threaten my team
with starvation.

13:43.880 --> 13:44.920
Amelia, wait.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.200
I see you taking little pills.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.080
Now, I have no idea
what fucked you up so badly,

13:52.080 --> 13:55.960
but this school fucked me up in ways that
I don't think you could possibly imagine.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.160
And I'll never forgive you
for asking me to return to the person

13:59.160 --> 14:00.880
I worked very hard to leave behind.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.000
- Saskia, it doesn't...
- Fucking dig, Sarah K!

14:05.000 --> 14:06.520
Move your fat ass!

14:11.600 --> 14:12.800
The deadline stands.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.640
Oh, fuck.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.240
Fuck, fuck fuck!

14:34.640 --> 14:35.760
Mmm...

14:47.840 --> 14:49.080
Motherfucker.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.760
Don't look at me like that.

15:01.720 --> 15:02.840
Didn't know what I was doing.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.400
Sandy!

15:07.240 --> 15:08.600
Sandy!

15:11.240 --> 15:12.520
Sandy!

15:12.520 --> 15:15.120
Sandy!

15:20.760 --> 15:22.480
Oh, no.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.720
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.960
No!

16:06.240 --> 16:08.400
I'll have a strawberry milk
and a meat pie, please.

16:10.840 --> 16:11.840
Seriously.

16:12.400 --> 16:17.000
Just give us a shred, a nibble,
anything to help us focus.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.080
Please don't ask me, okay?
I can't give you anything.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.440
- Saskia's orders.
- Come on, Teresa.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.840
She's given us an impossible task.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.600
No, you don't understand, okay?

16:27.960 --> 16:31.640
Saskia said if you came to demand food,
the entire class, not just the nerds,

16:31.640 --> 16:34.080
would go without rations
until electricity was created.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.360
That fucking bitch.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.360
Yeah, so...

16:39.160 --> 16:41.960
You were never here.
We never had this conversation.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.320
Yeah.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.240
Amelia.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.280
I have been curious
about that secret stash

16:55.280 --> 16:58.080
of junk food we used to keep
in the boarding school manhole.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.800
According to my little cousin,
the tradition still stands.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.000
Oh, shit!

17:26.080 --> 17:27.000
Oh!

17:27.720 --> 17:28.760
Uh...

17:29.680 --> 17:31.040
Need some help up there?

17:31.400 --> 17:33.960
No, I'm good. I, uh...

17:33.960 --> 17:35.040
I'm doing fine.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.960
Yeah. Totally fine.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.800
Amelia, do you think
maybe we should just talk about this?

17:39.920 --> 17:42.880
Because the last time I saw you,
you just ditched me at lunch for Danny.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.280
No. No, I'm good. Yeah.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.680
So, um...

17:47.560 --> 17:48.680
Yeah, you can go.

17:49.880 --> 17:50.800
Cool.

17:52.520 --> 17:53.640
Cool, cool, cool.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.560
Fuck.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.800
Oh, fuck, shit.

18:08.720 --> 18:12.440
Dear God, I know I haven't prayed
since the last election,

18:12.440 --> 18:14.160
and you didn't really come through anyway,

18:14.160 --> 18:17.520
but, please, help me
take a shit at school.

18:17.960 --> 18:18.960
I beg of you.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.720
Oh! Thank you, God.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.240
Thank you.

19:06.040 --> 19:06.960
Amen!

19:13.560 --> 19:14.800
Uh...

19:14.920 --> 19:16.760
No. It's got to be deeper.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.280
At least one and a half Tegans.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.880
I'm fucking Megan.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.400
Zoe. Hey, Zoe. Uh...

19:21.400 --> 19:24.320
I'm happy to be a gronk, but I think
I could be more useful to the nerds.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.320
You know, given that I work...

19:25.320 --> 19:26.760
Yeah, I can't talk right now,
Forgettable Laura.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.560
- Yeah.
- Hey, what's going on?

19:28.680 --> 19:32.800
Um, so the PR strategy has been planted,
if you will.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.800
But while I was out there, I found some
communication of the very real variety.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.680
Okay. Enough of the corporate babble.
What are you trying to say?

19:38.680 --> 19:41.000
I found a broken fucking oar, Saskia.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.560
And if the oar couldn't survive,
how could Sandy?

19:46.160 --> 19:48.320
- We fucking killed her.
- Don't you mean you killed her?

19:48.440 --> 19:52.640
Stop with your gaslighting bullshit, okay?
We both know what we both did.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.240
Come on,
you know you're dispensable, right?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.680
Or at least that much was clear when
you nearly fell in the fucking sinkhole

19:59.680 --> 20:01.240
and no one tried to save you.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.000
Do you not feel bad about Sandy at all?

20:07.320 --> 20:08.520
You've got no idea.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.440
Great work, ladies!

20:12.440 --> 20:14.480
Pop her in the next one
and let's get it going.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.040
Disappear that oar or take the hit alone

20:17.040 --> 20:19.320
because this class will not survive
without me leading it.

20:19.440 --> 20:22.720
Finish Sandy's story
and start telling anyone who asks

20:22.720 --> 20:25.240
that, no, you can't help them.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.480
Got it?

20:28.040 --> 20:29.960
Hey, Zoe, about the job allocation...

20:29.960 --> 20:32.160
Get the fuck back to work,
Forgettable Laura.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.280
Okay.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.240
- That is a fiery pickle juice.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.800
- What the hell are you doing?
- Flame-grilled rat.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.800
It'll be finger-licking good.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.960
Don't eat that.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.560
Oh, shit!

20:51.680 --> 20:53.560
No. No, no, not the brows.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.800
No, no, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.
Please don't cry.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.280
Save it for emotional release hour.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.440
Okay. Just like hiding a book
in a library, Zo-Zo.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.160
Oars belong on boats.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.040
Nothing weird about this.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.080
Hi.

21:22.760 --> 21:26.080
I... Oh, God, for God's sake. Um...

21:26.200 --> 21:27.520
I do need your help.

21:29.240 --> 21:32.720
Saskia is starving out the nerds,
and it's really dangerous, so, um...

21:35.400 --> 21:39.080
Can you...
Can you ask her to let up, please?

21:39.080 --> 21:40.480
Uh...

21:40.960 --> 21:42.040
I'm...

21:42.480 --> 21:44.160
I'm sorry, I can't.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.320
Why?

21:47.800 --> 21:48.880
Because...

21:49.520 --> 21:52.240
- I just can't.
- Because Saskia said so.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.720
Fucking hell.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.720
Did you seriously just punch me
in the tit?

22:07.720 --> 22:11.040
Yeah. I did. All right, Zoe?
Because all you do is look out for you,

22:11.040 --> 22:12.920
all right? You're fucking selfish.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.760
- You always have been.
- Selfish?

22:15.080 --> 22:18.720
I'm building you a fucking boat.
How am I selfish?

22:18.720 --> 22:20.600
I never asked for a boat.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.160
No, of course you didn't.

22:22.160 --> 22:25.040
You never ask for anything, do you?
You just fucking martyr yourself.

22:25.480 --> 22:28.200
I take responsibility for myself, okay?

22:28.200 --> 22:29.760
I don't hide behind other people.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.200
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

22:31.200 --> 22:34.080
<i>So I was friends with Saskia. Get over it.</i>

22:34.400 --> 22:36.240
<i>You were fucking glued to Danny.</i>

22:36.240 --> 22:39.200
Like, sorry that I decided to go
and make other friends,

22:39.200 --> 22:42.120
so I didn't have to third-wheel it
with you and your horndog gardener.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.720
Zoe, we weren't even
hanging out when I left.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.880
<i>You were so done with me
by that point...</i>

22:46.880 --> 22:48.560
<i>Oh, my God. Bullshit. Bullshit.</i>

22:48.560 --> 22:50.200
I would get home
every single day from school,

22:50.200 --> 22:53.920
and I would fucking star-69
to see if you'd called, and you never had.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.880
I tried, Amelia, okay?

22:56.440 --> 22:58.920
And at some point you're going to have
to stop blaming me

22:58.920 --> 23:00.360
for whatever happened to us.

23:00.360 --> 23:02.160
There is no us, Zoe.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.760
There is no us. People drift apart.
People outgrow each other.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.960
We don't have to hold each other hostage
over "best friends forever" bracelets.

23:08.960 --> 23:12.360
Yeah, no, for sure, 'cause you're not
holding onto anything, are you?

23:12.360 --> 23:14.000
No, of course not.
Because otherwise you would just

23:14.000 --> 23:16.680
fucking come out and say it,
that Danny knocked you up.

23:17.640 --> 23:20.400
Is that it? Or your parents went broke

23:20.400 --> 23:22.880
and they had to pull you out of school,
or what?

23:22.880 --> 23:27.040
What? You got expelled for plagiarism
or for fucking a staff member?

23:27.040 --> 23:29.000
I mean, what the fuck was it?

23:33.360 --> 23:38.360
Okay, fine. Well, listen,
until you can swallow your fucking pride

23:38.360 --> 23:43.160
and tell me what it is that I apparently
did wrong ten fucking years ago,

23:43.520 --> 23:46.320
I'm just going to have to assume
that it's totally unimportant.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.960
In fact, knowing you,
it's probably petty as fuck.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.320
Fuck this.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.520
Let's just stay the hell away
from each other, okay?

23:58.520 --> 24:00.880
- Yeah. Fine.
- And get out from under Saskia,

24:00.880 --> 24:02.160
for all of our sakes.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.200
Fucking hell.

24:13.560 --> 24:18.280
Would you like a super arch, or maybe
something a little bit more standard?

24:18.280 --> 24:21.280
I spent a lot of money on these brows,
so if you could just keep pretty much

24:21.280 --> 24:22.960
to their natural shape,
that would be good.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.280
Duly noted.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.440
Where's Tegan?

24:26.440 --> 24:28.120
I don't know. She just said
she hadn't been this long

24:28.120 --> 24:30.000
without Megan before,
and then she just bailed.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.120
Friendship's weird, I know.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.920
So, what do you got?

24:34.920 --> 24:37.200
KFC? Oh, sushi?

24:37.560 --> 24:39.400
Halal snack pack, maybe?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.760
Pretty sure
she doesn't have anything.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.680
Can you put this down?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.600
-  I'm hungry.
-  I know. So am I.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.320
I want that rat.

24:51.880 --> 24:52.720
Fried rat.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.760
-  Amelia?

25:11.680 --> 25:14.080
Um, you okay?

25:18.080 --> 25:20.320
I'm sorry, guys. I just...

25:20.680 --> 25:22.520
Saskia's given us an ultimatum,

25:22.520 --> 25:25.280
and we're not gonna eat
until we create electricity.

25:25.280 --> 25:28.320
I didn't want to pressure you
with fucked-up threats, but...

25:29.360 --> 25:31.640
I've looked high and low,
and there's no food anywhere.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.080
Okay, um...

25:34.080 --> 25:35.440
- Okay.
- I'll start here.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.200
Yeah, we got this. Don't worry about it.

25:37.200 --> 25:41.080
Remember I said,
power equals I squared R, so... Okay.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.640
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.040
Ooh!

25:51.760 --> 25:53.200
Let there be light.

25:53.640 --> 25:57.440
Let's hear it
for the Innovation and Research team.

25:58.760 --> 25:59.720
You guys!

25:59.720 --> 26:01.920
I knew you could do it. Told you.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.560
And also for our gronks.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.120
I mean, Infrastructure team.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.960
We have managed to assemble
a shit-ton of shit boxes.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.040
So there's no excuse
for bush poos any more.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.400
Come on, ladies.
We fucking built electricity today.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.440
We are better than bush poos, aren't we?

26:17.440 --> 26:18.480
This is disgusting.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.680
Guys, we've got
a fucking stigmata situation.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.720
Yeah. We were down by the water's edge,

26:23.720 --> 26:26.000
- looking for mushrooms so that...
- For food.

26:26.640 --> 26:27.800
- Obviously.
- Obviously.

26:28.080 --> 26:32.080
But, no, we stumbled across
Mother Maz dawg here with a note for us.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.840
This place is haunted as fuck.

26:33.840 --> 26:37.720
Like, we're pretty sure
we also saw Sister Bicky's ghost

26:37.720 --> 26:39.640
doing calisthenics on the oval.

26:40.320 --> 26:44.320
Yeah, because we definitely
did not find mushrooms.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.960
Uh, show me that.

26:56.800 --> 26:57.800
"Dear bitches."

26:58.520 --> 26:59.440
That's rude.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.960
"Please don't be mad. I've left.

27:01.960 --> 27:04.920
I realised I couldn't live
without Constable.

27:04.920 --> 27:08.560
And once I found my D'Amiré,
I knew I had to bail on this dump

27:08.560 --> 27:11.120
to try getting back to the US.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.760
I've taken a rowboat.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.960
Soz if you needed it,
but I needed it more. Sandy."

27:16.520 --> 27:18.320
Wow.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.320
Well, I guess we can stop looking.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.120
Sandy is gone.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.480
Oh, no, anyone but Sandy.

27:26.480 --> 27:29.800
Zoe, would you like to
add anything as SRC rep?

27:30.560 --> 27:31.680
Uh...

27:33.360 --> 27:35.880
Yeah. Just...

27:36.560 --> 27:38.520
that, um...

27:40.280 --> 27:41.840
I think I speak for all of us

27:42.280 --> 27:45.120
when I say, "To Sandy."

27:46.400 --> 27:48.560
Safe voyage home, Sandy.

27:49.760 --> 27:53.000
To Sandy.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
And to Sister Bicky, who said that
this group would never amount to anything.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.520
So, with the utmost disrespect,
I say, go fuck yourself, Bicky!

28:03.520 --> 28:06.360
-  Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

28:07.440 --> 28:08.880
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

28:10.200 --> 28:14.160
- <i>♪ Ridge Heights ladies standing proud ♪</i>
-  Oh, no.

28:14.160 --> 28:18.400
<i>♪ We make such a clever crowd ♪</i>

28:18.400 --> 28:21.840
<i>♪ Conscientious and polite ♪</i>

28:21.840 --> 28:24.520
What was it that you wanted
to say to me earlier, Forgettable Laura?

28:24.520 --> 28:25.760
Oh.

28:25.960 --> 28:29.360
- You know, only that I work as...
- Actually, one second.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.600
An electrical engineer.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.760
Breathe in.

28:55.640 --> 28:56.480
Breathe out.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.760
You said it yourself, Sas.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.600
Sandy would never go anywhere
without her bag.
