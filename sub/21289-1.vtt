05:13.032 --> 05:14.909

great state of Louisiana to gave rights

And I'm very proud to say

05:37.089 --> 05:38.454

05:38.524 --> 05:41.118
Our state has been the pioneer in
out shore drilling

05:41.894 --> 05:42.861
and this nation

05:43.228 --> 05:46.709
depends on all natural gas that we provide.

05:48.534 --> 05:49.546

06:04.149 --> 06:05.889

I am busy.

07:52.925 --> 07:54.096
Now you Want to talk about something?

07:54.293 --> 07:57.842
Why don't we talk about the soar of
unemployment in this country?

07:58.230 --> 08:01.506
Why don't we talk about Americans
without health care?

08:01.867 --> 08:05.701
Why don't we talk about roads and bridges
that need to be built in this country?

08:06.371 --> 08:08.384
What wee have to do for this country?

08:08.540 --> 08:09.177
right now.

08:09.341 --> 08:10.319
Let's talk about that!

08:10.609 --> 08:16.787
Can We talk about the failed energy policies
of your party, because of cosy relationships
with Big Oil?

08:16.915 --> 08:18.689
that costing this nation dully?

08:20.852 --> 08:23.059
Well Gretna, I am sorry you feel that way

08:23.655 --> 08:26.442
but we believe those taxes got worth.

08:26.892 --> 08:29.725
as you cannot taxes the business owners

08:29.728 --> 08:32.366
without expecting some tripple down  effect of the fall
household's.

08:34.433 --> 08:39.245
So you would rather this country shrinking
middle class shoulders the taxes burden.

08:39.404 --> 08:40.712
What about the deficit?

08:40.772 --> 08:41.898
That is all time high

08:41.940 --> 08:45.751
What about the national debt that gonna pass down
to my grandkids

08:47.913 --> 08:49.062
It is no secret

08:49.214 --> 08:50.920
that we are facing some challenges

08:51.783 --> 08:53.319
But we have the plan

08:53.986 --> 08:56.147
to dress the concern of all American’s

08:56.622 --> 08:58.715
And we will march to Washington

08:59.191 --> 09:00.579
And we will get thing done

09:01.326 --> 09:03.089
I believe Americans want a change

09:03.662 --> 09:05.243
And I'm the man to deliver it.

09:05.897 --> 09:07.671
How can you say that will change things

09:08.033 --> 09:10.775
with over 150 lobbies in your campaign?

09:11.303 --> 09:12.133
Gretna

09:12.704 --> 09:15.366
All these people take a leave of absences’

09:15.707 --> 09:16.366
to work for me

09:16.575 --> 09:17.826
How cute! a lobbies, is a lobbies, is a lobbies

09:20.646 --> 09:22.623
The is the first rule of the Capital Hill.

09:23.048 --> 09:24.367
Well, I bet it's different.

09:25.317 --> 09:26.477
See, what I believe... is that

09:26.752 --> 09:29.710
Americans want and need

09:29.821 --> 09:32.016
Someone who understands their pains.

09:33.325 --> 09:34.599
Someone who can relate

09:35.794 --> 09:38.297
Not only that, someone who has the courage

09:38.530 --> 09:39.497
to lead them.

09:39.831 --> 09:41.981
Stand up for them ...
and fight for them.

09:42.868 --> 09:43.357
Senator ...

09:43.702 --> 09:44.441
you can relate

09:44.603 --> 09:49.575
Forbes magazine has your net worth
estimated at over 100 million dollar,

09:50.175 --> 09:52.507
How can you relate the working class
American?

09:52.911 --> 09:56.688
We'll let the Senator answer the question
when we come back after this break..
GOT TO PAY SOME BILLS. .

10:10.162 --> 10:10.912
That's an order, sir?

10:11.196 --> 10:11.855
Yes,that's an order, thanks.

10:13.365 --> 10:15.117
Man, that Tibbons is amazing.

10:17.069 --> 10:18.513
Kick out of his house when he is 16.

10:18.837 --> 10:20.816
35 cent in his pocket

10:21.073 --> 10:22.859
and he pushed himself far from the boothstrap,

10:23.375 --> 10:24.103
you hear me?

10:24.376 --> 10:25.138
Yes, sir.

10:26.178 --> 10:26.872
That man...

10:26.978 --> 10:29.253
now sits on a Ford 400 list...

10:30.515 --> 10:32.221
and that's what the discussion is all about

10:33.151 --> 10:35.540
It is cheaper to hit with the taxes break

10:36.121 --> 10:38.931
but that is easily as exemplified
won, you know

10:39.958 --> 10:41.232
He still earn for handout

10:41.326 --> 10:42.953
by a tragedy that happened years ago.

Bail out beggers and money grows up at
Wallstreet and all those politicians

11:11.590 --> 11:14.730
all need a lesson from stand up guy like
Jethro Tibbs.

11:19.364 --> 11:21.412
And when I get to Washington.

11:22.501 --> 11:24.150

28:35.166 --> 28:35.951
Hey, baby doll

28:36.400 --> 28:38.607
I miss you.

28:39.437 --> 28:41.917
you just make sure the check on time

28:49.280 --> 28:50.178
She hot on me.

28:51.849 --> 28:52.702
and good to me.

28:55.186 --> 28:59.725
Senator, I would like to switch our focus now,
possible to more domestic issues campaign finance

29:00.191 --> 29:03.217
I must admit, you are very effective in this area

29:03.527 --> 29:07.452
Cross the isle with some great compas,
must get reform legislation path.

29:08.365 --> 29:09.286
Well Thank you, Gretna.

29:10.334 --> 29:13.098
Actually I'm very proud of that. We
worked very hard

29:13.370 --> 29:17.227
to adhere to the principles that we
committed to ..concerning

29:17.875 --> 29:21.697
make contributions and the
special entries.

29:22.079 --> 29:24.035
Compromised into the electoral process

29:24.815 --> 29:25.941
of course

29:26.283 --> 29:28.069
As always we meet a lot of resistance
in Washington.

29:30.554 --> 29:31.293
but

29:31.288 --> 29:32.232
we got a gun

29:32.923 --> 29:33.867
and

29:33.891 --> 29:35.074
my leadership

29:35.626 --> 29:37.491
was instrumental in getting it done.

29:38.128 --> 29:41.427
and the last tab, I believe that I play demonstrate as
a president of United States.

29:42.099 --> 29:43.748
but one quick question, if you do not mind.

29:44.034 --> 29:46.696
Your opponents been openly critical about
your's in this issue.

29:47.037 --> 29:53.124
he said and I quote Senator Edmond  is not being
straight with the  American people about campaign
financing lupus''

29:53.711 --> 29:54.587
what are you say about this?

29:55.880 --> 29:59.441
Well, that's exactly the type of politics that
we run.. from

30:01.018 --> 30:05.671
you see ...  it same old, same old Washington,
Pardington bickering  ...

30:06.423 --> 30:07.720
and finger point. .

30:08.993 --> 30:13.214
See, they don't want to talk about the other side.
What they don't want to talk about

30:13.531 --> 30:15.431
is how they gonna raise
our taxes.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.149
make the government bigger

30:17.868 --> 30:19.904
when it should be smaller

30:20.371 --> 30:21.167
and more responsible.

30:21.372 --> 30:27.811
Well, have they been less hand off smaller government
during the morgues crisis may be we wouldn’t be
in recession right now.

30:28.212 --> 30:34.276
but more importantly, Senator, before we get
off track, there is lot talk about Article 527
in the tax code.

30:34.685 --> 30:38.917
that gonna allow organizations and foundations
to raise unlimited money

30:39.156 --> 30:41.670
and campaigning for whatever issue they chose
that's like they switch both better

30:42.092 --> 30:44.048
against Shawn Kerry

30:44.962 --> 30:47.874
Now, our sources are estimated that leadership
for American fund has tab

30:48.165 --> 30:52.249
a sum of 35 million dollar that will be used
campaigning against your opponents

30:54.171 --> 30:56.469
and a your convention host committee

30:56.707 --> 30:57.969
has also raise a tons of cash

30:58.242 --> 31:00.915
and all this is outside the
campaign finance boundaries

31:01.078 --> 31:03.171
imposed by your legislation in Congress.

31:03.547 --> 31:04.821
Is that a lupo, Senator?

31:05.082 --> 31:06.288
is that what your
Opponents talking about?

31:06.617 --> 31:07.845
Gretna, the first and for most ...
We have not broken any laws

31:09.553 --> 31:13.091
and will continue to open our honest
to these of Americans people.

31:13.757 --> 31:14.394
trust me, Gretna.

31:14.758 --> 31:15.599
Trust me.

31:16.293 --> 31:17.999
I literally wrote that law.

31:18.529 --> 31:20.463
How can you talk so
freely about changes

31:20.798 --> 31:21.765
when it's just more the same.

31:22.333 --> 31:23.857
same of player, same of game and rhetoric’s

31:24.101 --> 31:27.923
isn't it all just the smoke screen
the rich can get richer

31:28.238 --> 31:28.943
and the poor can stay regret.

31:29.640 --> 31:33.428
and I mean, how's big is the gap between
the have and have not?
-Oh boy...

31:33.877 --> 31:36.687
and who was paying those lobbies, before they
starting working for you?

31:37.815 --> 31:40.010
and why did they choose to work for you?

31:40.618 --> 31:43.200
But it does make sense somebody need
to serve your drinks

31:43.621 --> 31:45.179
and clean your big houses.
-you know what, you better need to hang those...
we can spent a lot of times.

31:51.395 --> 31:53.363
you better need get to use to answer the
tough questions.

31:55.099 --> 31:57.624
I will be calling your boss, you liar.

31:57.735 --> 32:01.068
You want your big government to fix's every
problems in your life.

32:01.472 --> 32:04.020
That's why we have third generations welfare families

32:04.408 --> 32:08.720
and how about 40 million babies that you
prochoice that a chance of life you stupid bitch?

32:09.146 --> 32:12.912
This man will be the next
president and whether do you folk's like it or not.

32:20.190 --> 32:21.316
Hey scan bee,
-as how the pretty dam job going on ?

32:22.326 --> 32:23.679
it's still taken event,

32:24.061 --> 32:26.666
and I let you know when its over.

32:27.331 --> 32:30.129
Do you think about the whore so all
thing back there?

32:30.534 --> 32:32.593
Maam, My mama taught me when commonsense.

32:33.370 --> 32:35.611
two things that don’t go together
are oil and water.

32:36.807 --> 32:39.264
must be nice to drop 200 million on a piece of steel.

32:40.778 --> 32:42.291
I wonder if they need a bodyguard.

32:42.713 --> 32:44.203
maybe I can retire early.

32:45.516 --> 32:48.906
yes, maybe they can drop a grand and pay off
my college loans.

32:49.286 --> 32:51.072
I got two mortgages.

32:51.321 --> 32:52.379
I got to fee braady bunch,

32:53.457 --> 32:54.867
But at lease it is not be bad
as the Cob's wife.

32:55.225 --> 32:57.500
She works for the CIA

32:58.629 --> 32:59.857
You know he cannot hide any money.

33:00.130 --> 33:01.370
If you find a dollar on the street

33:01.632 --> 33:02.348
she knows about it. That bitch she want half

33:06.603 --> 33:08.366

was with the governor this evening?

43:24.454 --> 43:26.433
Don't you see that man look at me?

43:26.823 --> 43:28.586
Maam, I am just here for security.

43:28.591 --> 43:29.523
Please go and have good time.

43:30.260 --> 43:31.727
Unbelievable!

43:44.007 --> 43:45.713
my goodness sweepea ...

43:45.742 --> 43:48.370
I thought you'd gone swallow up by the toilet bowl in there
.

43:48.378 --> 43:51.984
Oh, you worry about me. That's so cute.

43:58.021 --> 44:02.242
Now, I just love that Harrison Ford at the Air force
One, there is no movie like that anymore.

44:02.859 --> 44:08.820
I hear you, but it's like 50 people got
killed in that movie. It's too much violence for me

44:09.332 --> 44:11.311
it's Only a movie.

44:11.468 --> 44:12.617
I know,

44:12.736 --> 44:16.991
but still i mean don't you think it can't
going happen worries me
that can happen ...

44:17.006 --> 44:18.576
It's too much violence.

44:19.709 --> 44:22.086
You can not expect the movie industries to raise your
children.

44:22.112 --> 44:25.832
You have to decide if you wants and if doesn't want to
It is not our responsibility

44:25.915 --> 44:26.711
Of course not.

44:26.950 --> 44:29.259
What about all those murders taking place, eh?

44:29.786 --> 44:30.696
I mean. .

44:30.720 --> 44:33.280
what ensures that the violence of Hollywood
not going to hurt.

44:33.723 --> 44:35.281
Well, Son, you have to concurred.

44:35.258 --> 44:37.328
There are bad guys doing bad things.

44:37.961 --> 44:39.701
that can kill by the good guy, for a
good cause.

44:41.431 --> 44:42.739
With all due respect, governor.

44:42.866 --> 44:45.926
Killing is not always the best way to promote good
cause.

44:46.069 --> 44:48.003
Yes, but sometimes it's the only way.

44:49.139 --> 44:51.767
Well, we just have agree and disagree that's all.

44:52.242 --> 44:53.345
Mr.Governor,

44:53.343 --> 44:53.957
are you Okay?

44:55.278 --> 44:57.599
If you'll excuse me, I need to drink water.

45:02.452 --> 45:05.068
Do not waste your time entertaining some fools.

45:05.088 --> 45:06.362
makes no sense.

45:06.389 --> 45:09.802
It is a waste of time to explain what is good and
what is bad.

45:10.226 --> 45:11.705
My husband always hated him.

45:11.961 --> 45:14.498
Yes, but are separated by years.

45:14.731 --> 45:17.689

45:18.067 --> 45:22.800
Well, I understand it the throats cut level by
Hurricane get sugar cane and cane no more

45:29.646 --> 45:32.626
My husband always knew how to deal with all this
stakes competition.

45:34.217 --> 45:35.491
How about your wife, Governor?

45:35.485 --> 45:37.339
She can handle a little competition?

45:39.889 --> 45:41.584
If you'll excuse me.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.203
Violence also is in the Bible too, right?

45:46.496 --> 45:47.906
Come on, wait a minute,
you can not compare

45:48.631 --> 45:50.940
violence and violence ...
Gentlemen, gentlemen

45:51.134 --> 45:52.726

It was disappointing.

46:04.314 --> 46:04.917

46:05.515 --> 46:09.963
Look, I just wanted to apologize for not contributing
more to your leadership for the American Foundation

Can I have your attention please?

46:23.433 --> 46:24.274
A toast.

46:24.734 --> 46:26.463
The governor would like to say a few words.

46:27.670 --> 46:28.716
Ladies and gentlemen ...

46:29.572 --> 46:30.721
I want to thank you all for coming.

46:31.541 --> 46:32.849

46:39.349 --> 46:40.498
You know, 19 months ago ...

46:40.783 --> 46:43.160
A young farmer boy from the
North Carolina villas

46:43.820 --> 46:45.378
set out to change this country.

46:46.589 --> 46:47.726

Why not try my first ...

48:50.446 --> 48:52.858
Chocolate Pudding ... if
you know what I mean.

48:54.317 --> 48:58.094
You know? You remind me of a Black Spice Girl...

48:58.287 --> 48:59.561
You know, the black one...

She looks so delicious. .

49:10.833 --> 49:12.164

thirsty ...

49:21.711 --> 49:23.770

49:26.082 --> 49:28.858
You're so thirsty for power, you ...

49:29.952 --> 49:32.125

49:35.358 --> 49:36.996
Do you ike my English?

49:37.927 --> 49:39.371
I learned in prison.

49:42.031 --> 49:44.431

49:44.667 --> 49:47.215
Borrowing the money from the Chinese.

49:47.403 --> 49:50.258
so you can buy your
fury of your enemies ...

49:53.509 --> 49:56.091
your enemies bought of your friends

50:02.051 --> 50:04.372
you making them stronger ...

50:06.289 --> 50:08.860
and you leave yourself defenceless ...

50:12.462 --> 50:15.044
I did not know i was so clever. .

50:15.565 --> 50:19.467
I should have been a philosopher rather than a
mercenary soldier.

50:22.405 --> 50:23.747
Your, Americans. .

50:25.374 --> 50:26.944
you will pay

50:27.143 --> 50:29.145
for the sin of your past.

50:29.979 --> 50:32.766
Just like me I have a dirty past ...

do you know who hire me?

50:36.652 --> 50:37.744

My life could be in danger.

52:07.510 --> 52:11.412

protect me was hiding something.

I need more information.

55:06.789 --> 55:09.565
Majors, come on ... what were they thinking?

55:09.692 --> 55:12.786
Can you imagine? they need at least to them
they need the new Young Voter ...that why how
we can get him

55:16.232 --> 55:19.941
That is a decision... gonna bite him
square in the as.

55:20.770 --> 55:22.192
you always so exaggerated ...

55:23.706 --> 55:26.163

55:30.780 --> 55:33.795

55:36.252 --> 55:37.162

you know i don't think my ex-husband
tought is so touching ...

55:50.900 --> 55:56.520
It's hard time when you did away with a pure dynamical
ethic to both the professional ethics and you realize
that everything is not for everyone.

55:56.672 --> 55:58.094
Kumbaya!

55:59.672 --> 55:59.094

We are still working.

56:08.317 --> 56:09.124
Give me your pen.

56:11.654 --> 56:16.444
Pakistan is trading an information on nuclear
arrangement with the North Koreans

56:16.492 --> 56:20.212
and exchange with missile so they can use them
on their neighbours and India

56:20.729 --> 56:22.970
Rumours’ has said your boys in the mix

56:23.132 --> 56:24.975
Okay, nothing terribly new

56:25.501 --> 56:26.934
Not confirmed, except ...

56:28.737 --> 56:29.578
someone died.

56:29.839 --> 56:30.885
Or killed it.

56:32.775 --> 56:33.776
my guess... just the guess

56:34.343 --> 56:38.245
is that Majors

56:39.315 --> 56:41.408
and North Koreans, know something
the rest of us, do not it a well good untill the big
stake start it

56:41.650 --> 56:42.685
What do you mean?

56:43.552 --> 56:47.249
Intelligence suggests, North Korean had a hit squad to
take Majors self.

56:49.758 --> 56:50.895
It's huge?

56:52.862 --> 56:54.022
It makes perfect sense

56:54.163 --> 57:00.227

secret service details no find any state troops in
Louisiana.

57:00.369 --> 57:02.132
