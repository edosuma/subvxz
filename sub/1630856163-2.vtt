WEBVTT

00:28.445 --> 00:31.697
Must be some Bin Laden level shit
if they're bringing in the CIA.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.450
They even brought in the NSA tech nerds.

00:34.534 --> 00:35.368
Oh!

00:36.244 --> 00:37.620
Hey, Trunk!

00:37.704 --> 00:39.664
- Baby! What's up, man?
- My man.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.833
What are they feeding you?

00:43.126 --> 00:45.211
Hey, what y'all think this is about?

00:45.295 --> 00:47.004
Bet you a box of Claws it's Taliban.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.340
- I don't know. I'm feeling Russia.
- Really?

00:49.424 --> 00:50.925
As long as it's not Yemen.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.968
Why can't more shit go down in Fiji?

00:53.052 --> 00:55.179
Be nice to shoot
on the beach for a change.

00:55.263 --> 00:56.555
Oh, yeah.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.565
Damn. She's pretty hot.

01:06.941 --> 01:07.901
That's my daughter.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.319
I figured.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.446
She looks just like you.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.575
The name's Hagerty. Army EOD.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.413
Paul Yung. Air Force.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.625
I feel like we're going to be
best friends.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.254
Thank you all for coming.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.840
I'm sure you're wondering
what this operation is about

01:30.924 --> 01:32.383
and why all the secrecy.

01:32.467 --> 01:36.887
The truth is some special ops
are more special than others

01:36.971 --> 01:42.018
and this one
is unprecedented in our nation's history.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.647
You've been selected
for an Elite Tactical Unit,

01:46.231 --> 01:49.567
the best of the best combining forces

01:49.651 --> 01:51.277
in a way we've never done before

01:51.361 --> 01:53.821
to combat a threat
we've never seen before...

01:53.905 --> 01:58.201
a portable nuclear device on US soil.

02:02.330 --> 02:08.085
Leading this op will be
the best of the best of the best,

02:08.169 --> 02:10.213
Agent Ava Winters.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.924
The room is yours.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.303
Good morning, everyone.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.013
Normally, I'd start by saying,

02:19.097 --> 02:21.515
I'm honored to lead
this very impressive team,

02:21.599 --> 02:24.101
but screw the pleasantries.
I'm getting straight to it.

02:24.185 --> 02:27.271
Last week, we intercepted communications
of the terrorist plot

02:27.355 --> 02:29.398
from an arms dealer
operating out of Russia.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.608
Told you.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.859
Ivan Koslov.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.820
He keeps a low profile,
but in the illegal arms trade,

02:34.904 --> 02:36.614
he sits at the top of the pyramid.

02:37.407 --> 02:40.159
His father was Dmitry Koslov,

02:40.243 --> 02:44.914
a former KGB agent who had access
to the Soviet Union's nuclear stockpile.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.000
We took him out
with an air strike back in '99.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.753
His wife and daughter
were collateral damage.

02:50.837 --> 02:54.423
As you can imagine,
Ivan Koslov has held a bit of a grudge.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.550
What you think?

02:56.676 --> 02:57.885
She's cute for a suit.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.011
Careful, Mac.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.471
I don't shit where I eat.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.307
- Senior Chief McKnight, is it?
- The name my mama gave me.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.683
Something you want to share?

03:04.767 --> 03:07.020
Just ready to make
these commie bastards eat shit.

03:07.604 --> 03:11.232
As my tactical lead on this op,
this is the most important briefing.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.442
Pay attention,
I'll be using some big words

03:13.526 --> 03:16.445
and there'll be
no band geek to cheat off of.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.281
The fuck you laughing at?

03:19.365 --> 03:23.536
This is an early blueprint
of the Holy Grail of nuclear arms.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.163
With a five kiloton yield,

03:26.247 --> 03:29.041
enough to level an entire city.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.878
Ivan has plans
to sell this to the highest bidder.

03:33.171 --> 03:37.216
We're talking millions
of American lives at stake

03:37.300 --> 03:39.260
and that's just from the initial blast.

03:39.344 --> 03:43.348
The fallout will prove
exponentially more catastrophic.

03:45.183 --> 03:48.185
Your job is to locate
and neutralize this device

03:48.269 --> 03:50.230
before the transaction can take place.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.733
It's going to take
every ounce of your skill set.

03:55.109 --> 04:00.907
All of you working together
as a well-oiled machine.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.284
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

04:03.368 --> 04:05.035
You're supposed to be sobering up!

04:05.119 --> 04:08.330
You want to get a hangover, be my guest,
I'm keeping the buzz going.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.124
Stop bickering for five whole seconds?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.751
You're like an old married couple.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.503
Whoa! Where'd you get those from?

04:14.587 --> 04:16.797
- I raided the minibar before we left.
- Give me.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.299
The gummies are hitting me.

04:18.383 --> 04:21.218
- I'm sorry. Once I pop I can't stop.
- Give me the chips!

04:21.302 --> 04:22.469
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

04:22.553 --> 04:24.096
Stand down! Stand down!

04:25.765 --> 04:28.475
Hey! Watch it back there!

04:28.559 --> 04:31.353
I swear to Christ, I will land this thing!

04:31.437 --> 04:33.022
Somebody strap Hagerty in!

04:33.106 --> 04:35.107
He's fine. Just fucking drive. Shit.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.819
You know what?
Everyone just take a second, all right?

04:38.903 --> 04:40.487
Take a breath. Let me see it.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.325
Now, get your shit together!

04:44.409 --> 04:48.329
We have 6 hours and 54 minutes
to find the nuke.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.332
Can't wait to kick the shit out of
that Russian cocksucker.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.962
Not that there's anything wrong
with sucking cocks.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.674
To each his own, or her own or their own.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.970
I swear that was the last one.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.556
- Give me a fucking chip!
- Whoa!

05:09.309 --> 05:12.186
What did I say? Not in my fucking chopper!

05:12.270 --> 05:13.687
I will land this thing.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.338
- Paul. A little help here?
- Yup. On it.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.465
- You got him?
- Yeah.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.383
- Great.
- Okay.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.803
Keep your distance from these people

05:45.887 --> 05:47.805
unless you want them to smell the booze.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.516
Fix your hair
so it doesn't look like we just banged.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.018
No one can know about that.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.062
Last thing I need
is my authority undermined

05:55.146 --> 05:57.272
'cause you bragged
about sleeping with the boss.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.191
Brag? I didn't even come.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.235
You know how hard it is
to make me not come?

06:01.319 --> 06:03.862
Keep your mouth shut
and let me do the talking.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.614
I want to present professional--

06:06.949 --> 06:08.450
- Shit.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

06:08.534 --> 06:09.368
Okay.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.703
Are you okay, Winters?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.289
Yes. Sorry, it's these heels.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.040
No time to change.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.167
Uh, we can get you some new shoes.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.544
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.671
What happened to him?

06:20.755 --> 06:22.048
He was hurt in the raid.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.134
Well, get the medic to take a...

06:27.428 --> 06:28.387
look at him.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.765
Sorry, Colonel.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.433
Ah.

06:33.392 --> 06:34.227
This way.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.897
Unbelievable. I mean, what the fuck.

06:43.486 --> 06:47.031
<i>Sub-basement level 13,
security level Alpha.</i>

06:48.199 --> 06:50.701
So, this is Area 52?

06:50.785 --> 06:54.288
The public has a wild
imagination about what we're up to here.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.706
Silly nicknames aside,

06:55.790 --> 06:58.917
all my personnel have top secret clearance
and are at your service.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.211
Has Koslov been isolated
for interrogation?

07:01.295 --> 07:03.965
<i>We followed
your instructions to the letter.</i>

07:04.715 --> 07:07.676
<i>He hasn't made any statements,
but maybe you'll have more luck.</i>

07:07.760 --> 07:10.262
<i>And our crypto terrorist, Mr. Chen?</i>

07:10.346 --> 07:12.473
<i>It's his first time in custody,</i>

07:12.557 --> 07:14.850
<i>which is probably why
he pissed himself twice.</i>

07:14.934 --> 07:18.270
I'm gonna need full profiles
on everyone we brought in.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.815
Lerner, we're gonna need your database.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.317
Shit.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.902
What is it?

07:26.028 --> 07:28.781
<i>♪ If they ever tryna knock her
Put my foot up in your caca ♪</i>

07:28.865 --> 07:31.408
<i>♪ Call your mama and your papa
Like I'm finna take your daughter ♪</i>

07:31.492 --> 07:34.078
<i>♪ Turn that bitch into a soccer ball
And rocka, rocka, rocka ♪</i>

07:36.456 --> 07:38.249
Girl.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.626
Thank you.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.753
Girls' night.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.964
Here's to bitches who aren't bitches.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.966
No, we're not. Boom!

07:50.094 --> 07:51.095
Uh-uh.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.141
Oh!

07:55.683 --> 07:58.352
Your boss did
a real number on you, didn't she?

07:58.436 --> 08:00.604
Where do you and that ho work anyway?

08:00.688 --> 08:02.106
It's actually interagency.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.024
We, um...

08:04.108 --> 08:06.777
You know,
I'm not really supposed to talk about it.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.862
- Confidentiality clause.
- Right.

08:08.946 --> 08:13.033
Your boss just fucks your man
and then you protect her clause?

08:13.117 --> 08:14.452
Does that seem fair?

08:16.746 --> 08:20.041
Fuck it. So my company is here in Vegas

08:20.958 --> 08:22.043
for a convention.

08:22.960 --> 08:27.173
We spent the past six months
trying to get this Russian account.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.217
Things were looking shitty at first

08:30.301 --> 08:33.512
but we rallied and ended up getting it.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.181
Cause you're Maya the Destroyer! Okay?

08:36.265 --> 08:38.225
So we do this big celebration,

08:38.309 --> 08:40.144
my boss busts out the champagne.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.270
We're drinking.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.398
She starts treating me
like a friend for once.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.485
Even gave me props
for helping to find the nuke.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.781
New customers for business.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.243
Let's see how well she does
on the next business trip.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.163
I'm the most indispensable person
on the team.

08:59.247 --> 09:02.166
Without me, they're fucked.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.335
Oh! Is that right?

09:05.419 --> 09:06.754
Hmm.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.674
It looks like we're here.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.970
Welcome to Big Willy's.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.472
Holy moly.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.516
I haven't seen a live dick in two years.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.144
Well, you're about to be
surrounded by 'em.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.104
Come on.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.156
Now which one of you is gonna talk?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.908
This is bullshit!

09:35.992 --> 09:37.951
God. I mean, this is America, dickhead.

09:38.035 --> 09:41.163
You can't stick someone in a cage
and take all their shit away.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.291
When my followers see
that I haven't posted in two hours,

09:44.375 --> 09:46.210
they'll declare me a missing person.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.757
Can I speak to your supervisor?
'Cause I know you're not in charge.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.593
I'm gonna get a lawyer.
I'm going to sue all your asses.

09:54.677 --> 09:55.511
Watch me.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.679
Whoa! Whoa! What's going on?

09:57.763 --> 09:59.473
Groot here won't give me my phone.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.599
I know my rights.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.268
He can't do this to me.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.273
- Listen, I know you're upset.
- Yeah.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.736
- Lana. It's Lana, right?
- Yes.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.613
I could really use your help.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.783
I don't know anything! God!

10:17.867 --> 10:20.702
How many times do I have to say it?
I did nothing wrong.

10:20.786 --> 10:24.289
We found you half naked
with almost two kilos of coke.

10:24.373 --> 10:25.749
Sex isn't crime.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.961
And I'm pretty sure in Vegas
coke is like decriminalized.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.713
No. Not even close.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.967
Fuck.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.137
Fuck my life.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.351
I'm so hungry I could eat this whole room.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.727
I'm sorry I ate the chips.

10:45.811 --> 10:46.979
No, it's not okay.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.605
Fine. I'll go find the mess. Just chill.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.232
Oh, hey!

10:50.608 --> 10:53.110
Cook up those grilled cheeses
you made in Kandahar,

10:53.194 --> 10:55.028
the one with the garlic butter and shit.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.822
Garlic grillers, full shit. Copy.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.865
I want six.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.827
So, what exactly happened to him?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.872
Um, we're not entirely sure.
We believe he was drugged.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.957
Any idea what drugs they gave him?

11:07.041 --> 11:07.917
All of them.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.336
- Definitely some LSD.
- And ludes.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.380
Probably some K, E, most of the letters.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.384
- And a bunch of whippets.
- They drugged him with whippets?

11:16.967 --> 11:19.219
Fucking commies.
No regard for human decency.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.721
He smells like alcohol.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.682
I think one of the guys hit him
on the head with a bottle of vodka.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.767
- Yeah, and a bottle of tequila.
- Yeah.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.312
- Shouldn't you be writing this?
- Where's your pad?

11:29.146 --> 11:31.899
Tell me, Miss Kirkwood,

11:32.483 --> 11:34.776
how does a girl from Scobey, Montana

11:34.860 --> 11:37.237
end up with an international arms dealer?

11:37.321 --> 11:40.490
All I know is that
Ivan's a rich guy who likes to party.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.659
I met him at a club a few nights ago.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.662
He offered to show me his private jet.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.540
Okay. Did he mention why he was in Vegas?

11:48.624 --> 11:49.624
No.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.668
Did he say anything
about a nuclear device?

11:51.752 --> 11:53.045
No!

11:53.629 --> 11:54.547
God!

11:56.632 --> 12:01.219
I mean, it was a little sus that he had
all these like, scary MFs working for him,

12:01.303 --> 12:03.722
but I just thought he was a drug dealer.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.560
I do not fuck terrorists.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.730
I fucked a terrorist?

12:13.232 --> 12:14.066
Shit!

12:14.150 --> 12:18.362
It's okay. We all have
lapses in judgment sometimes.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.864
Um, you were with him for a few days.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.367
So anything you may have seen or heard

12:23.451 --> 12:27.163
could be the crucial information
that helps avert a catastrophe.

12:27.746 --> 12:28.831
So, think.

12:29.582 --> 12:33.919
Lana, what do you know
about Ivan and his associates?

12:34.753 --> 12:35.671
Uh...

12:36.881 --> 12:37.715
That's right.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.053
They spoke Russian.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.436
What'd she say?

12:51.520 --> 12:54.981
She's not the sharpest tool in the shed,
but she knows more than she thinks.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.066
Okay. Ha!

12:56.650 --> 12:57.984
All right. My turn.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.612
- I'll get Koslov to talk.
- No.

13:00.696 --> 13:03.407
You are not fucking this up
with your strong arm shit.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.242
- You're sitting this one out.
- Oh!

13:06.243 --> 13:07.911
This is because of the sex.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.288
Fucking kidding me?

13:10.664 --> 13:12.374
Keep your voice down.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.584
It's because you're drunk and belligerent.

13:14.668 --> 13:17.254
Like a Scottish football fan
whose team just lost.

13:17.338 --> 13:20.006
First of all, it's called fucking soccer.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.050
Second, I know exactly what I'm doing.

13:22.134 --> 13:25.011
- The fuck you're doing is standing down.
- Oh!

13:25.095 --> 13:28.057
We got one shot of squeezing something
out of this shithead.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.936
I'm handling it.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.573
Mmm-mmm.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.034
I knew you wanted to see me again.

13:48.118 --> 13:51.163
Cut the shit, Koslov.
Where's the real nuke?

13:51.247 --> 13:52.122
Ah!

13:52.748 --> 13:54.959
So my associate has contacted you.

13:55.918 --> 13:59.296
Must be really frustrating
to think that you have won

13:59.380 --> 14:03.425
and then realize
that you're still a step behind.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.347
You took a big risk
by popping your head out at the club.

14:09.014 --> 14:12.101
Just couldn't handle one more day
without partying, could you?

14:13.352 --> 14:14.770
Takes one to know one, huh?

14:16.063 --> 14:18.773
Matted hair, crumpled dress.

14:18.857 --> 14:21.068
Maybe both of us like having a good time.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.529
We're never letting you out of here.

14:24.613 --> 14:25.948
You know that, don't you?

14:29.451 --> 14:30.703
<i>You're wasting your time.</i>

14:31.662 --> 14:33.914
<i>And the clock is ticking. Tick-Tock.</i>

14:34.623 --> 14:37.209
Pointless. Pointless!

14:48.012 --> 14:51.307
Yeah. You and me both.
I got fucking blue vag over here.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.686
Maybe send me a pic,
so I can think a little more.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.858
Sideline me!
Don't fucking sideline LeBron.

15:01.942 --> 15:02.776
What's up?

15:02.860 --> 15:04.778
Winters still thinks
I'm a grunt foot soldier.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.446
Why do you give a fuck?

15:06.530 --> 15:07.948
I don't. Why would I?

15:08.032 --> 15:11.076
I could get answers
out of that piece of shit Koslov.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.246
Two minutes left in the Super Bowl,
Tom Brady sitting on the bench.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.789
I thought you were LeBron.

15:15.873 --> 15:16.998
I'm both!

15:17.082 --> 15:18.709
So go for it. Screw Winters.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.713
That needs to be flipped.

15:23.797 --> 15:26.132
- Now you Guy Fieri too?
- Triple fucking threat.

15:26.216 --> 15:27.092
Fuck.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.013
I have to say,
it wasn't entirely a bad plan.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.223
Make a fake nuke,

15:33.307 --> 15:36.184
trick some newbie terrorists
into giving you millions

15:36.268 --> 15:39.271
and then sell the genuine article
to someone else.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.940
Who can you trust
if not your nuclear arms dealer?

15:45.653 --> 15:49.865
You seem to be
awfully concerned about my etiquette

15:49.949 --> 15:53.118
with the people
who are planning to blow up this city.

15:54.286 --> 15:58.415
If I were Chen,
I'd be pissed I got played.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.253
If I were you, I'd be nervous he talks.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.630
Chen?

16:06.757 --> 16:09.385
- He doesn't know anything.
- Mmm.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.054
Why do you think I picked his group?

16:13.555 --> 16:18.352
His inexperience
can only be eclipsed by his hubris.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.607
I could have sold him
a cuckoo clock radio.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.903
I got nothing to fear from that imbecile.

16:28.904 --> 16:29.863
You...

16:31.240 --> 16:33.575
It is you however, who is nervous.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.161
I'm not nervous.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.372
Why is your leg shaking?

16:41.709 --> 16:44.920
Oh... 'Cause I got to piss really bad.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.715
So, thank you for making this quick

16:48.298 --> 16:50.134
and giving me everything I needed.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.688
Strike out already?

17:08.068 --> 17:10.820
How close is the nearest restroom?

17:10.904 --> 17:12.113
Opposite side of the base.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.907
I can get you an escort and key card.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.368
Forget it. I can wait.

17:18.746 --> 17:22.207
Mr. Chen, my name is Ava Winters.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.627
I think it's time we have a little talk.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.050
All right, shithead.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.051
Playtime's over.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.180
Good cop is gone
and now you're stuck with me.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.057
Waterboarding. How original.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.350
It's not for you.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.191
Am I supposed to be afraid?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.738
Yeah, that would be
the appropriate emotion

17:54.031 --> 17:57.450
'cause you don't fuck with America
and get away with it.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.577
There's a reason we're the best.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.121
The best at what?

18:01.997 --> 18:06.751
Your fragile economy is propped up
on 30 trillion dollars of debt.

18:06.835 --> 18:10.964
And militarily,
over the last half a century,

18:11.048 --> 18:13.258
the track record is full of failures.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.636
Do you really want
to compare military failures?

18:16.220 --> 18:18.638
The days of American hegemony
are long gone.

18:18.722 --> 18:22.392
Okay,
I don't know what that means,

18:22.476 --> 18:25.145
but I'm pretty sure
there's a diss somewhere in there.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.273
So let me tell you
something about America.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.526
We're still number one where it matters.

18:31.026 --> 18:36.197
Freedom, cold beer,
and kick-ass rock and roll music.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.576
Pretty much everything Springsteen covers
in "Born in the U.S.A."

18:40.786 --> 18:42.454
- You sure?
- Yeah.

18:43.455 --> 18:48.084
Because that song highlights the irony
of a country that overspends on war

18:48.168 --> 18:51.505
and then abandons everybody
the moment the conflict is over.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.177
<i>I want a lawyer.</i>

18:57.261 --> 18:58.929
We're way beyond lawyers.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.015
This isn't a holding cell at Vegas Metro.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.225
This facility technically doesn't exist.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.770
This place is where I make
people like you disappear.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.274
But it doesn't have to be.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.819
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.656
What you did was extremely stupid.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.533
People died.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.831
But lucky for you,
it was all Koslov's men.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.792
This doesn't have to be the end.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.505
Full immunity as long as your intel
leads us to the bomb being retrieved

19:33.589 --> 19:34.756
before it goes off.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.140
<i>Chen?</i>

19:44.266 --> 19:45.517
<i>He doesn't know anything.</i>

19:46.351 --> 19:48.187
<i>Why do you think I picked his group?</i>

19:49.062 --> 19:54.692
<i>His inexperience can only be eclipsed
by his hubris.</i>

19:54.776 --> 19:58.613
<i>I could have sold him
a cuckoo clock radio.</i>

19:58.697 --> 20:01.074
<i>I got nothing to fear from that imbecile.</i>

20:03.327 --> 20:05.454
If he knew what I had
he wouldn't say that.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.122
What do you have?

20:08.207 --> 20:11.376
You captured Koslov,
but who you really need is his courier.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.296
He's the one
he left in charge of the bomb.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.214
And you know who that is?

20:16.298 --> 20:18.300
No, but I know where he is.

20:18.884 --> 20:19.760
How?

20:20.469 --> 20:22.846
I didn't trust Ivan Koslov.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.014
I had a feeling
he would hack into my system

20:25.098 --> 20:26.725
to make sure my money was legit.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.854
So I purposely laid him our trap
and his courier fell for it.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.023
From then on, I was able to track his cell

20:34.107 --> 20:37.653
and if you get me my phone,
I can give you his location.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.823
Of course it's hidden within
a 4096 bit RSA

20:41.907 --> 20:43.742
that'll take you forever to decrypt.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.078
So, if you want it unlocked,

20:47.371 --> 20:51.500
I want total immunity in writing
signed by the Secretary of State.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.628
Let me see what I can do.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.345
- Get me his phone.
- Yes.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.848
Should the colonel contact
the Secretary of State's office?

21:06.932 --> 21:08.809
No. I just need
a letterhead and a printer.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.520
And can you show me
where that restroom is now?

21:12.604 --> 21:13.480
Yes, ma'am.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.484
Little faster, just a little bit faster.

21:18.860 --> 21:22.281
Looks like the drugs in his system
led to a pharmaceutical induced coma.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.202
But don't worry, I expect he'll regain
consciousness in about 9 to 12 hours.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.537
We don't have that kind of time.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.040
You ain't got a two to four hour version?

21:32.124 --> 21:34.125
Even if I had Narcan,
don't think I can rouse him.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.794
Short of your man getting
Heisenberg level methamphetamine,

21:36.878 --> 21:38.714
he's gonna be out cold.

21:39.881 --> 21:40.924
Fuck.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.261
You take that back,
you beet-loving sack of shit.

21:48.307 --> 21:52.060
Bruce Springsteen, Hulk Hogan,
and Pam Anderson are American Treasures.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.311
You keep talking smack,

21:53.395 --> 21:55.730
I'm gonna throw you through
that goddamn window.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.525
Pam Anderson is Canadian

21:59.151 --> 22:01.986
and your ancestors were Russian.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.405
Motherfucker.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.416
Of course. Fuck me!

22:21.423 --> 22:22.299
Come on!

22:25.552 --> 22:26.511
Fuck!

22:34.770 --> 22:35.728
That all you got?

22:35.812 --> 22:39.691
At least struggle, put up a fight.
Now, where's the fucking bomb?

22:43.195 --> 22:45.405
Which one of your goons has the bomb?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.365
You'll never find them.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.868
You already let them
slip through your fingers.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.704
McKnight, stop!

22:55.791 --> 22:57.626
- Cuff him, take him to the medic.
- Yes.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.044
That's how we do it.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.296
The only way.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.048
You fucked him up.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.136
What the fuck was that?

23:09.096 --> 23:11.848
I specifically told you
to back the fuck off.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.308
And now you may have
jeopardized this mission.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.685
Do you like apples?

23:16.269 --> 23:17.854
What are you talking about?

23:17.938 --> 23:21.024
Because I got intel.
How do you like them apples?

23:22.734 --> 23:24.736
<i>Good Will Hunting,</i> when Matt Damon gets--

23:24.820 --> 23:26.320
What's the fucking intel?

23:26.404 --> 23:29.616
Ivan said his man
slipped through our fingers.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.618
So somebody we came in contact with.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.871
So who's left
that's not dead or in custody?

23:35.747 --> 23:38.083
- Someone slipped through our fingers?
- Hmm.

23:55.475 --> 23:56.977
The guy with the ear.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.563
That really narrows it down.

24:12.492 --> 24:14.661
I know you are all on edge.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.454
But rest easy,

24:17.164 --> 24:19.499
we will bring our comrade home.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.587
And what about the bomb?

24:25.463 --> 24:29.050
Our buyer will have to wait.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.558
Bring the car around.

24:47.235 --> 24:49.404
<i>Give me an update.</i>

24:50.113 --> 24:53.324
This woman is the main technical expert
on the government's team.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.785
She says the others
are helpless without her.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.995
Bring me that juicy meat stick.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.123
I'm gonna snap in two like a Slim Jim.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.083
She is indispensable?

25:02.167 --> 25:03.793
Then dispense of her.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.712
<i>I will send Josef to pick you up.</i>

25:06.796 --> 25:08.423
<i>Just make it quiet.</i>

25:10.217 --> 25:11.926
Sharonda! You gotta see this.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.387
He's spinning his thing around
like a propeller.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.016
I'll take care of her.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.194
Let's go. The medic's waiting.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.572
Shit. What's wrong?

25:37.702 --> 25:38.536
Stop!

25:40.413 --> 25:42.290
Alert the Pentagon.
I got a lead on the nuke.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.208
You mean we got a lead. We got a lead.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.669
- I'll contact Joint Chiefs.
- I'll inform Langley.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.921
Are you sure
this creep is telling the truth?

25:49.005 --> 25:50.590
Yes, and once Chen decrypts the phone,

25:50.674 --> 25:53.092
we'll be able to track down
the guy with the ear.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.179
What the fuck was that?

25:58.473 --> 25:59.516
Drop it.

26:05.689 --> 26:08.191
Now I'm ready to go back to my cell.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.110
Get this piece of shit out of here.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.914
Fuck. How we supposed to track
the ear guy now?

26:25.125 --> 26:26.126
We need Lerner.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.504

26:30.588 --> 26:33.925

26:43.226 --> 26:45.519
Ooh! Interception, biatch.

26:45.603 --> 26:47.689
No Apple for you, Eve.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.650
Oh, my God. It's so good!

26:55.071 --> 26:57.531
- Here you go, babe. Two Palomas.
- Thank you.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.012
Tech Chick has got to be somewhere.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.223
Anyone called the hotel to check her room?

27:22.307 --> 27:23.516
Yeah. Of course, we did.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.601
Didn't we?

27:25.685 --> 27:28.187
Don't look at me.
I was the designated driver.

27:28.271 --> 27:29.105
Got her.

27:29.981 --> 27:33.109
Her credit card was swiped
at a place called Engorge LLC.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.694
What the hell is that?

27:35.278 --> 27:37.697
Oh! That's a credit card alias
for Big Willy's.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.700
We need to work up intel
on this Big Willy fellow.

27:40.784 --> 27:41.993
It's dicks, Paul.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.619
Yeah, it's a strip club.

27:43.703 --> 27:46.080
Get the Vulture ready.
We're heading to town.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.915
She's coming with us.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.750
What? No, she's a civilian.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.503
She spent the last 72 hours
with Ivan Koslov.

27:52.587 --> 27:54.588
If she remembers something
I want her by my side.

27:54.672 --> 27:57.967
Ah! Finally! I can't wait
to get the fuck out of here.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.344
You're gonna love Big Willy's.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.764
Mmm. I don't know if it's your scene.

28:04.557 --> 28:06.225
Hey, girlfriend!

28:06.309 --> 28:08.269
You missed the most amazing dancer.

28:08.353 --> 28:11.772
He was doing things with his abs
that I'm sure abs aren't supposed to do.

28:13.108 --> 28:16.068
It was like cats running around in there,
but in a good way.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.987
Well, I'm here now.

28:18.071 --> 28:21.198
Let's keep the party going. Drink up.

28:21.282 --> 28:25.077
Hello, ladies.
What are we celebrating tonight?

28:25.161 --> 28:27.872
Oh, hey. I loved your performance.

28:28.790 --> 28:32.377
Thank you. I couldn't help
but notice you when I was on stage.

28:33.044 --> 28:33.878
Mind if I sit?

28:33.962 --> 28:35.422
- Actually, we were--
- Sure.

28:36.339 --> 28:39.342
Thank you. Jeremy, by the way.

28:39.426 --> 28:40.468
Maya.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.262
- Pleasure.
- With an M.

28:43.346 --> 28:44.222
Okay.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.771
Will you strap him in?

28:51.855 --> 28:54.357
- You're gonna get him killed!
- He's fine.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.360
I know what I'm doing.
A little fresh air will do him good.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.030
I can't believe we left them sandwiches!

29:01.114 --> 29:02.657
Will you let it go already?

29:02.741 --> 29:05.368
Have some water.
It's better than nothing. I got you.

29:13.835 --> 29:14.877
You all right?

29:14.961 --> 29:16.587
I never had a chance to pee.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.839
You should try to urinate
seven times a day.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.384
Bacteria can build up and give you a UTI.

29:21.468 --> 29:24.345
- I always aim for an even ten.
- Not helpful, Paul!

29:29.017 --> 29:30.518
Oh, my God.

29:32.687 --> 29:33.854
Everybody look away.

29:33.938 --> 29:35.064
We're all adults here.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.941
That's an order. Look away.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.750
Damn, Winters. You sure one can is enough?

29:54.834 --> 29:57.169
Uh... I... I don't know.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.046
Jesus! How much did you drink?

29:59.130 --> 30:01.590
It's a thin can. Do you have another?

30:01.674 --> 30:03.635
If she has another I'm going ballistic.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.808
Okay. Yeah, we're done.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.401
I swear we're all professionals.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.947
- Most of the time.
- I've peed in weirder places.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.578
- Oh, shit!
- McKnight, no!

30:30.662 --> 30:32.204
McKnight!

30:32.288 --> 30:34.457
- Paul! Hover!
- Shit.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.043
McKnight!

30:39.671 --> 30:40.755
McKnight!

30:42.841 --> 30:45.718
- I'm slipping! He's too heavy!
- Grab my hand!

30:45.802 --> 30:48.971
Fuck no! We're 400 pounds combined.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.389
No way you can hold us!

30:50.473 --> 30:53.058
I grab your hand,
all three of us are dead!

30:53.142 --> 30:55.645
Just shut up and grab my hand!

30:56.187 --> 30:57.230
No way!

30:58.481 --> 30:59.774
Ugh!

31:01.401 --> 31:03.903
- Ugh! It's in my mouth!
- You're slipping!

31:04.404 --> 31:05.613
McKnight!

31:05.697 --> 31:07.072
Oh! Fuck!

31:13.413 --> 31:14.455
I got you.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.638
Shit. Shit!

31:32.932 --> 31:34.267
Did you eat asparagus?

31:36.102 --> 31:38.229
So then when
I was a sophomore at MIT,

31:38.313 --> 31:40.564
I hacked into Google's
data center in Oregon,

31:40.648 --> 31:42.024
and changed their algorithms,

31:42.108 --> 31:45.569
so whenever people looked up
serial killers, they got ads for cereal.

31:45.653 --> 31:48.447
But what I didn't realize
was it had the reverse effect.

31:48.531 --> 31:50.449
The next day, Kellogg's got complaints

31:50.533 --> 31:52.785
from people
who were looking up Rice Krispies

31:52.869 --> 31:54.453
but got images of mutilated bodies.

31:54.537 --> 31:56.330
That's crazy!

31:56.414 --> 31:58.541
You know, I love how smart you are.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.335
What do you say we go to the back room?

32:01.419 --> 32:03.212
I can give you a private dance

32:04.005 --> 32:06.632
and hear more about
these wild days at MIT.

32:06.716 --> 32:09.093
Backroom. Sounds naughty.

32:10.386 --> 32:12.388
Are you gonna be okay here without me?

32:12.472 --> 32:16.433
Oh, of course, of course,
but let's do a toast before you leave.

32:17.685 --> 32:19.562
To my new bestie!

32:19.646 --> 32:21.105
Friends forever!

32:21.648 --> 32:24.067
Until the day we die, baby.

32:25.652 --> 32:29.613
Oh! Oh, no, I can't drink this.
It has grapefruit in it.

32:29.697 --> 32:30.740
I'm allergic to citrus.

32:33.701 --> 32:34.661
I'm sorry.

32:35.411 --> 32:38.831
But the cheers still counts, right?

32:39.707 --> 32:41.084
To the back room!

33:05.274 --> 33:07.902
Can I at least come in
for a drink or something?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.820
Oh! We're not getting drinks.

33:09.904 --> 33:12.072
Uh, Paul, can you watch her?

33:12.156 --> 33:14.074
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

33:14.158 --> 33:14.993
Ugh!

33:15.618 --> 33:16.828
There you go.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.705
Wait, why are we bringing Hagerty?

33:19.789 --> 33:22.416
There's strippers, there's blow,
there's blow, there's meth.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.460
That's what the doctor said
will wake him up.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.045
Doctor's orders.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.596
Hey! Can I fly the plane?

33:38.266 --> 33:40.809
<i>♪ She's my cherry pie ♪</i>

33:40.893 --> 33:43.604
<i>♪ Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise ♪</i>

33:43.688 --> 33:46.398
<i>♪ Tastes so good
Makes a grown man cry ♪</i>

33:46.482 --> 33:48.525
<i>♪ Sweet cherry pie... ♪</i>

33:48.609 --> 33:50.194
Oh, yeah!

33:50.778 --> 33:53.364
If you like desserts,
you should try my banana split.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.533
They have ice cream here?

33:56.409 --> 33:58.118
This place really is the best.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.662
No. It's...

34:00.663 --> 34:02.665
Here, I'll show you.

34:05.626 --> 34:06.877
Oh!

34:06.961 --> 34:08.671
Your dick is the banana.

34:08.755 --> 34:09.589
Yeah.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.800
But you'll love this.

34:16.971 --> 34:20.099
What's wrong? Lactose intolerant?

34:26.022 --> 34:28.691
No more fucking around with this bitch.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.365
Are all male strip clubs this packed?

34:36.449 --> 34:37.574
Why are you asking me?

34:37.658 --> 34:39.743
I mean, it just seems like a fun place.

34:39.827 --> 34:42.454
Yo, yo, Trunk. My man!

34:42.538 --> 34:43.539
Hey.

34:44.207 --> 34:47.209
We got four new dancers tonight.
You want your usual table?

34:47.293 --> 34:48.127
I'm good.

34:48.211 --> 34:49.212
All right.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.174
All right,
let's all spread out and find Maya.

34:54.258 --> 34:57.512
Without her,
we do not track down this... All right?

34:57.637 --> 34:59.680
Rendezvous with the Vulture in ten.

35:00.181 --> 35:01.057
I got it.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.814
- Oh, wow.
- What is it? You find her?

35:08.898 --> 35:09.732
Mmm.

35:10.399 --> 35:15.863
No, but this ecstasy is hitting me
so amazing right now.

35:15.947 --> 35:19.033
Guys, if we end up dying,

35:19.992 --> 35:21.744
I just want to say, I love y'all.

35:22.495 --> 35:23.663
I love you.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.290
I hate all of you.
Get your head in the game

35:26.374 --> 35:27.416
and find Maya.

35:28.417 --> 35:29.376
Bing!

35:29.460 --> 35:31.212
- Ooh!
- Bing!

35:32.088 --> 35:35.090
Hey, stud. You came to the right table.

35:35.174 --> 35:38.427
I'm actually looking for someone.
Maybe you can help me find her.

35:38.511 --> 35:40.596
I got her right here.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.684
Holy shit. You're hot!

35:45.268 --> 35:46.894
- This is Janet.
- Yeah.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.563
- It's her divorce party!
- Uh-huh.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.441
Congratulations
on your failed marriage, Janet.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.248
Look natural.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.294
All right, I'm right here, buddy.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.172
Trunk is going to help wake you up.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.859
There you go, baby.

36:37.069 --> 36:39.030
Damn. Fuck.

36:43.034 --> 36:43.868
Fuck it.

36:51.751 --> 36:54.628
Ew. No, no. No titties in here. Biatch.

36:54.712 --> 36:55.630
Fuck off.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.613
You want to be the cowboy or horse?

37:21.697 --> 37:25.243
Usually I'm a cut to the chase guy
but today I need to find this girl.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.494
You found her.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.122
It's settled. You're the horse!

37:32.875 --> 37:34.377
Ow! Ow!

37:35.253 --> 37:36.128
Ow!

37:36.879 --> 37:38.589
Fuck, you're bending my dick.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.927
And then the cherry fell off my nipple.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.095
Oh, God.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.472
I'm never gonna be able
to look him in the eye.

37:47.556 --> 37:49.141
Hey, stop it. Okay?

37:49.809 --> 37:51.894
I bet McKnight thinks very highly of you.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.063
He doesn't even know my name.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.440
I'm just another tech geek to him.

37:56.524 --> 37:57.525
Tech geek?

37:58.442 --> 37:59.277
Not anymore.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.196
You showed your wild side tonight, Maya.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.281
The table is set.

38:04.198 --> 38:08.119
Fuck that bitch, Ava. Okay?
You need to take what's yours.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.955
- You think so?
- I know so.

38:12.164 --> 38:13.207
Now.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.168
Why don't we start having some fun?

38:18.629 --> 38:20.589
Jeremy, you got it up my nose.

38:37.023 --> 38:40.484
All right, ladies,
let's hear it for Mr. Clean.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.238
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

38:44.947 --> 38:47.533
Gotta love this place, huh?

38:48.242 --> 38:52.121
Just wish the dances were free.
Am I right, huh?

38:54.290 --> 38:55.415
Yoo-hoo?

38:55.499 --> 38:58.001
You taking a little nappy nap?

38:58.085 --> 38:58.961
Wow!

38:59.837 --> 39:01.088
Good for you.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.882
Good for you.

39:03.966 --> 39:05.092
I need pills.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.346
Hmm!

39:14.185 --> 39:16.270
Oh! Oh-ho!

39:17.063 --> 39:18.731
What do we got here?

39:19.815 --> 39:21.066
Jackpot.

39:21.150 --> 39:24.987
You gonna buy me a dancey dance?

39:25.071 --> 39:28.657
You are so generous,
I'm gonna owe you one.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.161
Fellas, look who's flush again.

39:33.245 --> 39:36.499
Yes, come to Daddy, boys.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.751
Yeah, yeah.

39:39.835 --> 39:42.254
Look at that move for you too, big boy.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.384
Yes, yes, get in that no-no hole.

39:47.426 --> 39:49.845
Mind if I have a sip of your cocktail?

39:51.764 --> 39:52.723
Mmm.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.602
Damn! Come on, hydrate my face, Barry.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.897
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

40:00.981 --> 40:02.607
- There you go.
- Thank you.

40:02.691 --> 40:05.111
- Thank you, partner.
- Shit.

40:05.903 --> 40:06.862
You got meth?

40:07.405 --> 40:09.656
I asked the guy to give me
some Heisenberg level shit.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.325
It is blue.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.785
Yeah. Open his mouth.

40:14.495 --> 40:17.081
- All of that?
- Let's just hope this shit works.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.377
Here we go. That's okay. Good.

40:24.338 --> 40:25.631
Shit!

40:26.674 --> 40:27.883
Whoo!

40:30.845 --> 40:33.263
You're so right. It's not over.

40:33.347 --> 40:35.182
Next time I see him, he's mine.

40:35.891 --> 40:38.894
Damn right.
That's what I'm talking about, Maya.

40:38.978 --> 40:39.812
Drop it.

40:42.690 --> 40:46.569
Either the gun and the bag hit the floor,
or your brains do. It's your choice.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.364
That's right. Down on your knees.

41:07.715 --> 41:08.549
Ava?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.968
You bitch, that's my friend!

41:12.720 --> 41:13.637
Maya, no!

41:19.310 --> 41:20.978
Stop fighting!

41:37.745 --> 41:39.705
What the fuck? What the fuck?

41:41.582 --> 41:42.416
You bitch.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.876
Winters, what the hell?

41:49.089 --> 41:51.133
- McKnight! No!
- I got this, Maya.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.885
- You called me Maya.
- Isn't that--

41:53.969 --> 41:56.472
Sharonda! No.
That's the guy I was telling you about.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.017
Oh! Hell no!

42:00.726 --> 42:03.103
We paid for that dancer, you skank!

42:04.355 --> 42:06.690
- Oh, shit.
- I'm gonna ride you like a bull!

42:07.274 --> 42:08.692
Get the fuck off me, Janet!

42:09.276 --> 42:12.029
- Eight-second Champion.
- She's running.

42:16.992 --> 42:18.785
Block the exits. Bogey on the loose.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.372
Will someone tell me
what the hell is going on?

42:26.502 --> 42:27.628
Got her.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.052
There's no escape.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.814
Call 911! We need an ambulance!

42:48.023 --> 42:50.484
- Shit! She's getting away!
- Oh, shit!

42:50.568 --> 42:51.569
God damn it!

42:53.904 --> 42:56.282
- What happened to Hagerty?
- He's fine. Come on.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.963
Fuck!

43:11.547 --> 43:13.965
- Who the hell was that?
- Must be working for Ivan.

43:14.049 --> 43:15.926
- I fucking hate you!
- I can't.

43:16.010 --> 43:19.554
Take it easy. I got problems
with her too but she just saved your life.

43:19.638 --> 43:22.265
She's a Russian asset.
She was going to kill you.

43:22.349 --> 43:23.391
Bullshit.

43:23.475 --> 43:26.686
You expect me to believe that
after you fucked McKnight?

43:26.770 --> 43:28.813
What? You boned the boss?

43:28.897 --> 43:30.482
Does it count if I didn't finish?

43:30.566 --> 43:32.150
How the fuck you not finish?

43:32.234 --> 43:33.611
Can we not talk about this?

43:34.903 --> 43:36.947
Uh, she's not gonna kill herself, is she?

43:42.411 --> 43:43.495
Let's go.

43:45.205 --> 43:46.665
- Let's go.
- Wow!

43:47.541 --> 43:48.751
Hey, sorry, guys.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.419
I'm gonna have to join this party.

43:53.255 --> 43:55.674
Not gonna be that kind of party, okay?
Listen up.

43:55.758 --> 43:58.719
The US government's
commandeering this bus. Everybody out.

43:59.303 --> 44:02.598
Back off, tough guy.
I picked up the bill for this pussymobile.

44:03.766 --> 44:05.141
Did you keep the receipt?

44:11.398 --> 44:12.733
- There.
- On it.

44:17.696 --> 44:18.530
They're on us.

44:23.327 --> 44:26.080
They're heading towards the Strip.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.003
Here. You dropped these.

44:33.087 --> 44:35.547
I need you to decrypt this phone
as fast as you can.

44:35.631 --> 44:37.299
Why the hell should I help you?

44:37.383 --> 44:39.718
I would love to talk this out
with you right now

44:39.802 --> 44:42.554
but remember that nuke
we deactivated earlier?

44:42.638 --> 44:45.599
Turns out it was a fake
and the real one is still out there

44:45.683 --> 44:48.310
and we only have
about six hours to find it.

44:49.311 --> 44:50.604
- Shit!
- Exactly.

44:54.233 --> 44:56.193
Okay. Uh, where's my laptop?

44:56.735 --> 44:58.570
I left it at the party.
We have to go back.

44:58.654 --> 45:00.405
- There's no time.
- She yakked all over it.

45:00.489 --> 45:01.698
It's dead.

45:01.782 --> 45:02.783
Come on, Maya.

45:03.450 --> 45:04.368
Give me the phone.

45:05.119 --> 45:05.953
Guys?

45:07.204 --> 45:08.955
Jesus fucking Christ.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.498
- I'm on it.
- Hang on!

45:24.263 --> 45:26.348
They wanna play? Let's play.

45:30.227 --> 45:31.311
What is she doing?

45:36.024 --> 45:37.109
Oh, that's not good.

45:40.112 --> 45:41.947
Get us away from that fucking thing.

45:42.781 --> 45:44.241
What do you think I'm doing?

45:53.667 --> 45:56.545
Shit!

45:59.047 --> 46:01.841
Get him off me.
I can feel his dick in my belly button.

46:01.925 --> 46:02.968
Oh, shit.

46:04.928 --> 46:07.347
You sure that dude didn't sell you Viagra?

46:07.431 --> 46:08.807
At least part of him is up.

46:15.272 --> 46:17.191
- Get him off of me!
- Shit!

46:21.320 --> 46:22.279
You all right, bud?

46:22.863 --> 46:25.156
I am now. My name's Pete.

46:25.240 --> 46:26.492
Yeah, good for you, Pete.

46:33.373 --> 46:36.293
- Shit, she's reloading.
- Yeah, I can see that.

46:47.429 --> 46:48.263
Fuck!

46:50.599 --> 46:54.353
Brace yourself.
This one is going to be a lot closer.

47:11.954 --> 47:13.955
Thank God, Air Force stayed sober.

47:14.039 --> 47:15.915
Great shot, Paul! Fuck yeah!

47:15.999 --> 47:19.252
That's the job, McKnight.
I always have my eyes on you.

47:19.336 --> 47:22.589
And I always have my eyes on you, Paulie.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.633
We smoked that bitch good.

47:25.717 --> 47:26.676
What the--

47:26.760 --> 47:29.220
Trust me, if your wife saw that shit,

47:29.304 --> 47:31.681
she'd be sucking both our dicks.

47:31.765 --> 47:32.599
Oh, yeah.

47:36.436 --> 47:37.353
That's your wife!

47:37.437 --> 47:38.647
What the fuck?

47:39.773 --> 47:41.733
<i>Everything okay up there, Paul?</i>

47:49.074 --> 47:50.659
Yeah, I just...

47:52.953 --> 47:53.787
Never mind.

47:54.788 --> 47:57.165
All good. I'm coming down to you.

48:02.921 --> 48:05.840
Hey, you tell anybody about this,

48:05.924 --> 48:08.260
I will find you and I will kill you.

48:08.969 --> 48:09.928
As you should.

48:12.431 --> 48:15.141
- Can I get your--
- Just go, Pete. Bye.

48:15.225 --> 48:16.059
Okay.

48:16.893 --> 48:18.103
Got it.

48:19.896 --> 48:21.898
It's a tracker.
Someone named Vladislav Litvin.

48:21.982 --> 48:24.109
He's Ivan's courier. The guy with the ear.

48:24.776 --> 48:27.153
- This is live.
- So if we follow this dot?

48:27.237 --> 48:28.530
We get the guy with the bomb.

48:30.449 --> 48:32.951
<i>Hey, honey.
You've reached Sharonda.</i>

48:33.035 --> 48:34.328
<i>You know what to do.</i>

48:38.332 --> 48:40.334
Our friend isn't answering.

48:41.710 --> 48:43.211
What about Josef?

48:44.630 --> 48:47.257
- No.
- Dead then.

48:49.384 --> 48:52.846
It's the Americans.
They aren't going away easily.

48:53.597 --> 48:55.431
<i>We've underestimated them.</i>

48:55.515 --> 48:58.726
- Hit up a drive-thru?
- We're tracking the ear guy.

48:58.810 --> 49:00.645
- On the bus.
- We blew up a car.

49:00.729 --> 49:02.480
It's okay. They were the bad guys.

49:02.564 --> 49:04.732
They have their top people on us.

49:04.816 --> 49:06.484
If they hit a drive-thru?

49:06.568 --> 49:08.653
- Give it a rest.
- I'm not talking to you.

49:08.737 --> 49:10.947
They are a serious problem.

49:11.698 --> 49:14.409
Don't stick your nose in more butts.

49:14.493 --> 49:18.246
<i>We have to step up
our performance to meet theirs.</i>

49:18.330 --> 49:19.164
All good.

49:20.499 --> 49:21.458
Fuck yeah.

49:22.626 --> 49:24.878
Should we return to the safe house?

49:25.671 --> 49:26.505
No.

49:27.714 --> 49:30.175
We proceed with the plan.

49:31.510 --> 49:33.679
They think they have the upper hand.

49:35.764 --> 49:38.975
But they will soon be proven wrong.
