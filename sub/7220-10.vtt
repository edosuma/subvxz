00:02.160 --> 00:03.560
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.600 --> 00:05.045
Hand over them gator teeth.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.201
Make me.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.370
So how about you come out,

00:13.440 --> 00:15.010
say what it is you got to say?

00:15.080 --> 00:16.525
I'm a snitch.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.364
I'm a C.I. for Raylan.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.681
Where did you get this?

00:20.760 --> 00:22.524
That came from an
old-time U.S. attorney

00:22.600 --> 00:23.681
named Simon Poole,

00:23.760 --> 00:25.330
and it was sealed
about 15 years ago.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.323
Congratulations.
You got me.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.447
I was a rat.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.443
What would happen if
Katherine Hale found out

00:30.520 --> 00:32.966
that you're the one who
got her husband killed?

00:33.040 --> 00:34.485
I helped you out once before.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.483
Maybe there is a way
I can help you out again.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.289
At some point
in our line of work,

00:38.360 --> 00:40.283
if you want to survive,
this is what you do.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.361
Not me.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.885
I got a code,

00:42.960 --> 00:45.042
and it does not include
turning on my people.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.690
Name's Boon.
Pleased to meet you.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.410
I wouldn't rush
to judgment on that.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.881
Man, you are everything
I'd hoped for,

00:50.960 --> 00:52.041
right down to the hat.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.963
Well, I feel I should warn you

00:54.040 --> 00:55.485
Markham's previous employees

00:55.560 --> 00:57.403
have not fared well
in these parts.

00:57.480 --> 01:00.245
Every one of you who has been
approached about your property,

01:00.320 --> 01:01.560
this is my offer.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.882
I will give you cash for
your land, same as Markham,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.207
but the difference is I don't
want to move you guys out.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.487
Just want to move some seed in.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.450
Throw in with me, and we'll
make Harlan prosperous

01:12.520 --> 01:14.124
our own selves.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.043
Give this county
back to the people

01:16.120 --> 01:17.326
the way we all know
it should be!

01:25.360 --> 01:26.725
We need to get to your vault.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.404
I believe you're being robbed.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.370
Whatever that blast
was, it wasn't enough.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.844
One thing that
didn't occur to me...

01:34.520 --> 01:36.761
Dipshit's not capable
of pulling it off.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.771
What did you say
to your goddamn uncle?

01:38.840 --> 01:40.205
You trying to kill me now?
Is that it?

01:40.280 --> 01:41.486
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:41.560 --> 01:42.760
Your uncle tried to blow me up!

01:42.800 --> 01:44.768
- Is Zachariah dead?
- I don't know, Ava.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.763
- And the money?
- Still in the vault.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.968
It won't be for long. They're
gonna move it tonight.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.407
And that's
when I'm gonna hit it.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.160
Can I assume our partner
kept you in the dark

01:58.240 --> 02:01.323
about his plan to blow up a
building I was standing in?

02:01.400 --> 02:03.050
<i>Well,
in his defense,</i>

02:03.120 --> 02:04.804
he probably figured
you'd be ready for it,

02:04.880 --> 02:07.121
being under the impression
that Markham intended

02:07.200 --> 02:09.202
to move the money
as soon as the party ended.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.764
Who gave him that impression?

02:11.840 --> 02:12.887
I did.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.889
Do you want to explain that?

02:14.960 --> 02:18.328
Your, uh, reaction
to his wedding proposal

02:18.400 --> 02:20.448
made me worried you were
about to pull the rug out.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.200
You really are a bastard,
you know that?

02:24.280 --> 02:25.691
<i>Then you should
count yourself lucky</i>

02:25.760 --> 02:27.569
<i>we're on the same side.</i>

02:27.640 --> 02:30.325
We are still on the same
side, aren't we, Katherine?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.050
<i>Do you really need to ask?</i>

02:32.120 --> 02:35.920
What I really need is for you

02:36.000 --> 02:39.925
to find out if your fiance still
intends to relocate his money.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.764
<i>Oh, you mean
now that you've managed</i>

02:41.840 --> 02:44.002
<i>to manipulate Boyd into
setting his vault on fire?</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:45.320
<i>Well, to tell you the truth,</i>

02:45.400 --> 02:47.641
<i>I haven't been able to get
ahold of Avery for hours.</i>

02:47.720 --> 02:50.166
Well, I... He must have
a lot on his mind.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.971
Can, uh... Can I assume
that you'll be in touch

02:53.040 --> 02:54.371
once you hear from him?

02:54.440 --> 02:56.681
<i>Wynn, I want that
money as much as you do.</i>

02:56.760 --> 02:59.127
Then you can imagine what I'm
willing to do to get it.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.289
Jesus Christ.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.725
That should put you at ease...

03:05.520 --> 03:08.091
Knowing Boyd hasn't talked to
Katherine, discovered your lie,

03:08.160 --> 03:09.685
plug you as soon as
you walk in his door?

03:09.760 --> 03:11.683
Actually, I was thinking I
don't need to walk in his door.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.889
Whatever she gets from Markham,
she can give directly to Boyd.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.644
There's no need to
keep me as the go-between.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.927
Oh, dangling the bait's
only step one.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.002
You need to report back
to us on Boyd's plan.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.890
We're giving you a chance to
atone for tonight's screw-up.

03:23.960 --> 03:27.009
You told me to tell Boyd
the money was on the move.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.525
I told him.
He moved.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.648
It is not my fault it went bad.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.849
Unless you told him to make
it look like it went bad

03:33.920 --> 03:35.922
so we'd have nothing
meaningful to bust him on.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.764
And I would do that,
what, out of my, uh,

03:37.840 --> 03:39.683
deep and abiding affection
for Boyd Crowder?

03:39.760 --> 03:42.764
Normally, Wynn, I like to avoid
pondering your motivations.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.729
If I had to guess, though,
I'd say you're trying

03:44.800 --> 03:47.167
to preserve whatever chance you
got left at the $10 million.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.044
Well, in that case, gentlemen,

03:50.120 --> 03:52.088
thank you for once again
allowing me to prove my loyalty

03:52.160 --> 03:56.006
to the United States...
Marshals Service.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.124
I wasn't sure you'd show.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.725
Come on, Boyd.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.841
You know Ellstin Limehouse
has made a fortune

04:17.920 --> 04:20.571
being the man folks can count
on in times of trouble.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.611
And I recall you yourself

04:22.680 --> 04:25.365
have benefited from that
on more than one occasion.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.683
And on reflection, I wonder if
the benefit warranted the cost.

04:30.240 --> 04:33.005
You know, all the women I gave
sanctuary to all these years,

04:33.080 --> 04:34.684
there's only one I regret?

04:36.440 --> 04:37.601
Ava,

04:37.880 --> 04:39.760
me and Limehouse are
gonna step into the office,

04:39.800 --> 04:41.165
do some business, okay?

04:42.960 --> 04:44.200
Come on.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.088
Hell, you look like
you've seen a ghost,

04:56.800 --> 04:58.006
if you don't mind my saying.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.727
I didn't see one so much
as I almost became one.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.682
I did something I knew
always brings me trouble.

05:04.760 --> 05:05.807
And what is that?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.965
I went back down a mine.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.763
You find what you was
looking for, at least?

05:10.840 --> 05:13.207
What say
we cut the small talk?

05:13.560 --> 05:14.971
I don't like you.

05:15.720 --> 05:16.846
Not only do you know it,

05:16.960 --> 05:20.407
but you damn well
feel the same about me.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.370
Now, simple truth is,
you're the only man I know

05:23.440 --> 05:25.249
who can get me what I need,

05:25.320 --> 05:28.244
and I'm willing to pay you more money
than you've ever made for doing it.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.321
So you fixing to
leave this place, huh?

05:32.800 --> 05:35.929
How many reasons you gonna
give me for having your back?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.087
$50,000.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.568
Is that for you
or for the both of you?

05:47.800 --> 05:49.006
For the both of us.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.846
You know, that reward money

05:55.920 --> 05:58.287
you collected for
that Walker fella was, uh...

05:58.360 --> 06:00.408
It was $100,000, if I recall.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.766
It's what I heard on the radio.

06:04.920 --> 06:08.811
How did I know
you were gonna say that?

06:11.800 --> 06:15.566
Well, sir, you shall
have your clean out...

06:16.520 --> 06:19.285
And vanish like you had
disappeared in that mine...

06:20.000 --> 06:21.570
On one condition.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.800
Name it.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.491
That when you're gone,

06:26.640 --> 06:29.644
you will never again
set foot in Harlan County.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.883
You ain't got to ask me twice.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.962
Your boss here, or did he
just let you borrow the car?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.371
He's in the restroom.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.649
Vanilla cone.
All right.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.851
You got anything to drink
besides coffee?

07:47.920 --> 07:49.445
Water, soda...

07:49.520 --> 07:52.126
I'd offer to make you a
milkshake, but the mixer's down.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.605
- Forget it.
- All right.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.805
Been thinking on what you said

08:01.880 --> 08:04.167
about that movie cowboy
and his toy gun.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.166
Put me in mind how you
come across a lot of guys

08:07.240 --> 08:09.322
who go heels like
they're playing dress-up.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.523
Take this fella...

08:12.600 --> 08:14.841
Wears that lid on his head,

08:14.920 --> 08:17.491
but I'll bet he can't tell
a mare from a stallion.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.683
Anybody ever tell you
you should talk less?

08:22.560 --> 08:24.483
Yeah. One guy.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.288
Well, you're young yet.

08:27.400 --> 08:31.724
Anyway... The matter
I wanted your take on...

08:32.120 --> 08:34.645
You come across a fella
like this...

08:34.720 --> 08:37.041
Never sat a horse
or roped a steer,

08:37.159 --> 08:39.924
wants putting on a hat
to make him a...

08:40.039 --> 08:41.405
A buckaroo.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.601
You think it's up to
gentlemen like us to...

08:47.360 --> 08:49.044
Disabuse him?

08:49.360 --> 08:51.647
You're asking if we're keepers
of some kind of flame.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.726
I guess my main take is I
believe you're overestimating

08:57.800 --> 08:59.484
how much you and I
have in common.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.204
All right.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.009
That gives me
something to think on.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.805
You here to arrest me?

09:08.720 --> 09:11.963
That depends. You got
something to confess to?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.607
Just here to lick on
that ice cream, then.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.802
You're gonna call
Katherine Hale.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.928
Tell her you're moving
the money to Charlotte.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.724
Why would I do that?

09:23.800 --> 09:26.087
How do you think it is that
Boyd has such a good handle

09:26.160 --> 09:29.004
on what you've got
and where you've got it?

09:29.560 --> 09:33.042
He has an inside man.
Woman. Whatever.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.926
Bullshit.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.571
Even if it is,
I don't see a downside.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.967
If she passes on
the information,

09:40.040 --> 09:41.644
we get Boyd for you.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.801
If she don't pass on
the information,

09:44.880 --> 09:47.690
you know you can trust
your wife-to-be.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.410
I already trust her.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.610
Give me one reason why I should
believe anything you say.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.920
If she's not trying to steal it,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.207
why would she ask you how
you're planning to move it?

09:58.280 --> 10:00.362
- She hasn't.
- She will.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.691
I'll tell you what.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.250
Why don't you just,
uh, give her a call?

10:10.480 --> 10:12.448
See if she brings up
the subject.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.650
- Hey, there.
<i>- Are you okay?</i>

10:36.720 --> 10:38.484
No, I'm fine.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.722
Just trying to figure out
where things stand.

10:41.720 --> 10:42.960
<i>Avery, have you thought about</i>

10:43.040 --> 10:45.611
<i>what you're gonna do
with the vault contents?</i>

10:46.240 --> 10:48.686
Actually,
we are this very minute...

10:49.400 --> 10:51.164
Trying to figure that out.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.208
<i>So, have you made a decision?</i>

10:54.120 --> 10:55.724
Matter of fact, I have.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.528
I'm sending the money
to Charlotte.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.531
Right here.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.682
- Charlotte?
- You heard the lady.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.967
What the hell's in Charlotte?

11:12.040 --> 11:13.610
I think Mr. Markham's
less concerned

11:13.680 --> 11:15.409
with what's there
than what isn't.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.527
Us.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.084
He figures that you figure

11:19.160 --> 11:22.243
his money is heading
to Lexington,

11:22.320 --> 11:24.129
which means
if you're gonna hit it,

11:24.200 --> 11:25.770
you're gonna hit it right here.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.128
He decides
he's gonna head south.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.720
Oh, we gonna hit it right there,

11:30.800 --> 11:32.325
right before
the Virginia state line.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.364
Road's one lane each way,

11:34.440 --> 11:37.250
steep rise on one side, steep
drop-off on the other.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.531
Oh, I used to do liquor runs
in high school.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.602
I could drive this
with my eyes closed.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.164
Now, Mr. Duffy, like my good
friend Ray always says,

11:45.240 --> 11:48.164
you never give up
before the miracle happens.

11:48.240 --> 11:52.006
Well, the miracle
is gonna happen right there.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.520
Well, that's what he said...

11:55.560 --> 11:58.040
Just on that side
of the Kentucky border.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.688
Well, if it isn't,
you know where to find me.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.645
Take us home, Mikey.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.840
Any more calls you need to make?

12:09.080 --> 12:10.411
Hey, Mikey.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.565
If you're gonna mention
your code again,

12:12.640 --> 12:14.961
um, we're gonna need to pull
over and get some bananas,

12:15.040 --> 12:16.246
so I can eat something

12:16.320 --> 12:19.449
that tastes the same coming
up as going down, okay?

12:19.520 --> 12:22.171
Nah.
I'm done with the code.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.121
Decided to put your
big-boy pants on, huh?

12:25.560 --> 12:26.925
Something like that.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.161
Good.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.608
Does this
seem right to you?

12:35.680 --> 12:37.444
- Which part?
- All of it.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.845
Boyd's gonna read this
with his eyes closed.

12:43.760 --> 12:47.890
Last night, you said Boyd would
hit the cash on the road,

12:47.960 --> 12:49.849
and then, today,
we go to all the trouble

12:49.920 --> 12:52.366
of putting together a bait truck
so he has something to hit.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.408
Duffy tells us
he's planning to hit it,

12:54.480 --> 12:56.687
we're watching one of his guys
appear to be waiting for it

12:56.760 --> 12:58.762
to move so he can hit it...

12:58.880 --> 13:00.086
All of which leads you
to conclude that

13:00.160 --> 13:02.049
that is, in fact, not his plan?

13:03.160 --> 13:05.128
He's too smart.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.362
Yeah, he's so smart,
he's stupid.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.521
Yeah.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.166
I'm just saying, last time
we tried something like this,

13:11.240 --> 13:13.163
we ended up with his underwear.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.804
My uncle...

13:24.880 --> 13:27.565
You're sure he couldn't have
made it out of that mine?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.130
You really want
to waste your time

13:29.200 --> 13:30.440
worrying about that traitor?

13:30.520 --> 13:33.046
The reason I'm worried...
If he's alive,

13:33.120 --> 13:35.202
there's a chance he could
come back and finish the job.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.248
Even if he
survived the blast,

13:37.320 --> 13:39.721
the rockfall cut him off
from the entrance.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.083
Crazy bastard...
Ran the wrong way.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.242
Probably got turned around
in the dark,

13:46.320 --> 13:48.160
everything looking the same
down there and all.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.250
Zachariah got turned around?

13:51.240 --> 13:54.449
Carl!
We all set, my man?

13:54.560 --> 13:55.766
Good to go!

13:55.840 --> 13:57.490
Whoo!

13:58.560 --> 14:00.562
You best be getting
a move on, son.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.127
We ain't riding together?

14:02.200 --> 14:03.326
Well, I got something
I got to do.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.560
I'm gonna be right behind you.

14:05.640 --> 14:06.971
All right.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.450
Baby, I need you
to head back to your place,

14:18.520 --> 14:20.602
pick up whatever Limehouse
has sorted for us...

14:20.760 --> 14:22.922
New papers, uh,
a car nobody's looking for.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.209
I'll be in touch and tell
you where to meet me.

14:26.280 --> 14:29.250
Somewhere close to where
you're hitting the truck?

14:29.600 --> 14:31.080
Ain't no money
gonna be in that truck.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.086
But you just told Carl...

14:33.160 --> 14:34.446
I know what I told Carl.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.081
What about Earl?

14:36.160 --> 14:38.367
He's still halfway a kid,
and you're serving them up?

14:38.480 --> 14:40.920
I'm just trying to make sure that
we don't get served up, Ava.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.440
How do you know the money
won't be in the truck?

14:44.480 --> 14:46.209
Because he's too smart for that.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.129
Markham?
Raylan!

14:48.240 --> 14:51.164
Now, don't ask me
any more goddamn questions!

14:53.760 --> 14:55.410
Just trust me.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.281
Meet me.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.608
What did she say, exactly?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.887
She said Boyd knows
there's nothing in the truck

15:23.960 --> 15:26.440
and plans to go after the
money by other means.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.444
Well, I don't suppose
she saw it fit to specify

15:29.520 --> 15:31.204
these "other means."

15:31.600 --> 15:33.409
She doesn't know.
She says.

15:33.480 --> 15:36.324
Well, sounds like you still got
some doubts about her loyalty.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.084
Boyd's guy still there?

15:38.160 --> 15:41.881
As a matter of fact, his
brother's just pulling up...

15:42.000 --> 15:43.764
Appears to be
getting in the car with him.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.211
<i>Tim, you stay on the car.</i>

15:45.280 --> 15:46.281
Roger that.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.089
Raylan, you sit on Ava.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.400
See where she leads us.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.005
And remember, okay,
there's a new bottom line.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.366
We have to catch Boyd

15:52.440 --> 15:55.171
in the commission
of a RICO predicate crime.

15:55.240 --> 15:58.164
Uh, Ava's testimony...
Absolutely worthless now.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.880
Where does that leave her?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.371
<i>Leave her? Back in prison</i>

16:01.480 --> 16:02.686
if I have anything
to do with it,

16:02.760 --> 16:04.967
serving out every last second
of her original sentence,

16:05.040 --> 16:06.929
plus anything else
I can tack on there,

16:07.000 --> 16:08.650
like obstruction or conspiracy.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.121
Even if she helps us
get Boyd with the money?

16:12.840 --> 16:15.810
Raylan,
it's too late for that now.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.086
Read the C.I. contract.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.605
She hasn't even come close

16:18.680 --> 16:19.966
to living up to her side
of the bargain,

16:20.080 --> 16:22.287
which means that we don't
have to live up to ours.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.084
You were done with him, right?

16:29.160 --> 16:31.242
Guess if I was him,
I wouldn't be crazy about

16:31.320 --> 16:32.924
putting Ava on
the stand, either.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.526
You really think
this ends in a trial?

16:35.640 --> 16:36.766
Shit, I hope so...

16:36.840 --> 16:38.001
All the work we've done.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.684
What I mean is you really think

16:39.760 --> 16:41.728
Boyd's gonna let us take him in

16:41.800 --> 16:43.325
instead of going out in a blaze

16:43.400 --> 16:46.006
like the outlaw he's spent
his whole life trying to be?

16:46.920 --> 16:48.922
Well, I guess
that'll be up to him.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.450
Won't it, Raylan?

17:06.520 --> 17:08.204
Katherine.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.290
I think I've finally found
a way to get at that money.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.330
A little early for me.

17:17.800 --> 17:18.881
Well, you brought it.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.928
Well, I was told
it was your favorite.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.681
Well, everybody's got to
have a hobby.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.049
So, you were saying
you're concerned

17:31.120 --> 17:34.681
my grandniece might be falling
in with a bad element?

17:34.760 --> 17:37.843
I'm saying that people who
associate with Boyd Crowder

17:37.920 --> 17:40.446
have a habit of
coming to a violent end.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.644
I know your family's
had its share of tragedy.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.290
My nephew's a sap.

17:47.120 --> 17:51.125
He got himself all moony-eyed
over that idiot he married

17:51.200 --> 17:53.851
and got even more
moony-eyed after she died.

17:55.280 --> 17:58.250
Not sure how she managed to
grow a head on her shoulders

17:58.320 --> 17:59.845
raised by that pair of nitwits.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.930
If you don't mind my asking,

18:02.000 --> 18:05.482
how is it Loretta ended up
in foster care

18:06.120 --> 18:07.804
instead of coming here
to live with you?

18:08.320 --> 18:11.449
Stuck-up bitch from
Family Services made noises

18:11.520 --> 18:14.126
like this place
ain't fit for habitation.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.846
You believe that?

18:17.360 --> 18:20.807
I been living in this house
for 52 goddamn years.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.531
And there's nobody else
could've taken her in?

18:24.320 --> 18:25.845
No other kin?

18:26.520 --> 18:30.809
Meaning if tragedy
were to strike again,

18:31.680 --> 18:35.127
would I stand to inherit
my grandniece's property?

18:39.040 --> 18:42.203
You think I don't know
who you are, Mr. Markham?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.082
Well, I introduced
myself at the door.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.810
Not your name.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.245
Who you are.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.646
What you are.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.041
What's that?

18:54.120 --> 18:55.406
Well, off the top of my head,

18:55.440 --> 18:57.647
I'd say a no-account peckervvood.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.563
And that's just for starters.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.803
Ma'am, I'm afraid
I've given a misimpression

19:07.880 --> 19:10.167
of my intent on
coming here to see you.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.925
Oh, I hope so.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.081
'Cause it seems to me

19:17.160 --> 19:18.286
you're here to get me

19:18.360 --> 19:21.170
to talk Loretta into
selling out to you...

19:22.800 --> 19:24.404
Or to sell out to you myself

19:24.480 --> 19:26.084
once you put her in the ground.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.445
That woman is tougher
than a pine knot.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.090
No go, huh?

19:42.280 --> 19:44.521
Notice she didn't turn down
your single-malt.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.967
You ever notice how the
necessities of our line of work

19:47.080 --> 19:49.208
weigh heavy on your conscience?

19:51.040 --> 19:54.089
Always seemed to me,
as far as conscience goes,

19:54.440 --> 19:55.521
the sweet spot is

19:55.600 --> 19:58.046
you either be poor enough
you can't afford to have one

19:58.120 --> 19:59.360
or rich enough you can afford

19:59.440 --> 20:01.283
to hire someone
to carry the weight.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.768
Boon. I'm sorry.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.685
I know you're fond of the girl.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.609
Fond's got
nothing to do with it.

20:42.840 --> 20:43.921
Hello, my love.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.126
Afraid not,
Mr. Markham.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.768
Been wondering
where you'd got to.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.001
Well, now you know.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.408
I suppose it'd be foolish
of me to ask what you want.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.010
I suppose it would be.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.650
Now, is this the point
in the conversation

20:55.720 --> 20:57.609
where you try to
buy yourself some time,

20:57.680 --> 20:59.842
tell me that money's
in a security van

20:59.920 --> 21:01.285
headed to North Carolina?

21:01.360 --> 21:03.442
I'd say we both know
that ain't so.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.008
And I ain't interested
in buying time.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.684
I'd rather just get this over.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.761
<i>Me and you both.</i>

21:08.840 --> 21:10.171
Here's how it's gonna go down.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.722
You're gonna load my money
up in your car

21:13.800 --> 21:15.484
and start driving north on 421.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.688
I'm gonna call you
with a meeting place.

21:18.120 --> 21:21.044
Now, you don't answer
your phone... She dies.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.770
You take too long getting
to the meet, she dies.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.127
And if you ain't alone
when you get there...

21:27.200 --> 21:29.487
Understood. Understood.

21:35.680 --> 21:36.727
You want me to come with?

21:37.200 --> 21:38.725
Man said to come alone.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.606
They always say that. Probably
heard it in the movies.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.445
Probably so.

21:49.640 --> 21:50.801
Want me to come with?

21:51.800 --> 21:53.882
No. Gonna play it straight.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.650
Call me if you change your mind.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.880
Not gonna try to sell me
on bringing you along?

22:03.400 --> 22:05.164
You pay me to do what you say.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.881
You say, "Stay," I stay. Say
something else, I do that.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.325
You're a good boy, Boon.
Stay out of trouble.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.008
I aim to find out
what kind of entertainment

22:15.080 --> 22:16.684
this shithole has to offer.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.286
So...

22:30.080 --> 22:34.244
When I asked you how long you'd
been snitching to the Marshals,

22:36.080 --> 22:40.244
you said "This time," implying
there'd been another time.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.847
Suddenly, I'm nostalgic
for the "code" talk.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.123
The other time was about
Grady Hale, right?

22:47.560 --> 22:48.880
You were the one
that gave him up?

22:49.800 --> 22:52.007
You just figure that out
all by yourself, Mikey?

22:52.440 --> 22:53.521
Yeah.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.362
Shut up!

23:33.480 --> 23:34.811
Shut the hell up!

23:36.840 --> 23:38.251
<i>This is Katherine Hale.</i>

23:38.320 --> 23:39.685
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

23:39.760 --> 23:42.206
Miss Hale,
this is Mike Cosmatopolis.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.203
Please call me
as soon as you get this.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.442
Believe I have something
that might interest you.

23:52.200 --> 23:55.283
You think this all ends
when you make that swap?

23:55.360 --> 23:57.408
You think I won't
come after you?

23:58.360 --> 24:02.126
Well, you'll do what you
feel you have to do.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.449
Boy, I got to
hand it to you, Boyd.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.887
You've got a hell of a knack
for keeping cool.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.446
Hmm...

24:11.520 --> 24:13.443
You don't even mind
looking over your shoulder

24:13.520 --> 24:15.329
for the rest of your life.

24:16.280 --> 24:20.001
Ain't nothing in my life
ever come for free.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.730
Yeah?

24:23.800 --> 24:25.643
Read me the next
road sign you pass.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.688
Hold on, there's one coming up.

24:28.880 --> 24:29.881
"Bledsoe."

24:30.400 --> 24:31.845
Well, all right.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.241
Now, as soon as you start
seeing signs for Mozelle,

24:34.320 --> 24:35.765
I want you to pull off.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.129
<i>I'll talk you in from there.</i>

24:38.200 --> 24:39.565
All right.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.730
No, they went easy.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.569
Didn't even try
to hurt our feelings.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.081
Boyd, too?

24:51.160 --> 24:52.446
<i>Boyd wasn't with them.</i>

24:52.760 --> 24:54.205
<i>Any chance
he might have slipped away</i>

24:54.280 --> 24:56.248
<i>while you were
taking down the others?</i>

24:56.320 --> 24:57.845
Always a chance, I guess,

24:57.920 --> 25:00.287
but everything I see
says he was never here.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.328
Raylan was right.
She was telling the truth.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.210
Hmm...

25:35.280 --> 25:37.487
"Mr. And Mrs. Ofay."

25:38.520 --> 25:41.364
Got to hand it to Limehouse,
he does have a sense of humor.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.245
Does good work, too.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.765
Can't say as I'm crazy
for the picture,

25:47.840 --> 25:49.763
although it was short notice.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.971
What are you doing here, Raylan?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.847
Well, I'm supposed to be
staying out of sight,

25:57.480 --> 25:59.642
seeing if you're shooting
straight about the getaway plan.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.485
If you are, follow you to Boyd,
catch him with the money.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.248
But you're not staying out of sight.
Mmm-mmm.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.004
So, what are you doing here?

26:09.400 --> 26:11.323
Vasquez is pulling the plug.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.321
What does that mean?

26:14.640 --> 26:16.847
It means he wants to
find something

26:17.520 --> 26:20.364
to bust Boyd on that doesn't
require your cooperation...

26:21.720 --> 26:23.006
Toss you back in prison.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.683
Boyd just called.

26:26.760 --> 26:30.003
Told me to bring him the getaway
that Limehouse put together,

26:31.000 --> 26:34.004
meet him at the spot where he
put this ring on my finger.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.444
You can get him with the money.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.931
It ain't enough, Ava.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.611
I'm sorry.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.726
Are you?

26:53.360 --> 26:55.010
What if we get him for murder?

26:56.320 --> 26:57.526
Whose murder?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.525
What's that?

27:02.160 --> 27:04.731
You meet a lot of guys with
gator-tooth necklaces, do you?

27:04.800 --> 27:06.450
I used to work in Florida.

27:07.720 --> 27:08.767
Where'd you find it?

27:09.120 --> 27:10.201
Hanging above the bar.

27:11.480 --> 27:15.565
And how, exactly, does
that help us to get Boyd?

27:16.680 --> 27:19.251
What do you mean?
For killing Dewey.

27:19.720 --> 27:20.926
Boyd killed Dewey?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.047
You know he did.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.322
You got a witness?
A weapon?

27:24.400 --> 27:25.640
Better yet, a body?

27:26.080 --> 27:28.481
Look close, Raylan.
There's blood on it.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.528
Ava, even if
that is Dewey's blood,

27:30.600 --> 27:32.045
there's nothing
that don't indicate

27:32.120 --> 27:33.645
he didn't just
cut himself shaving.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.085
It still ain't enough.

27:42.240 --> 27:46.404
So after everything, that's
how this is gonna end?

27:46.800 --> 27:48.404
It appears that way.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.808
What if I get him to confess?

28:11.760 --> 28:13.250
Fella told me a good waitress

28:13.320 --> 28:15.641
never lets you see the
bottom of your coffee cup.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.929
Guess I'd better
go be a good waitress.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.368
What'd you say to her?

28:32.480 --> 28:33.641
I didn't catch it.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.161
Can I get you anything else?

28:35.240 --> 28:36.651
Something to eat, maybe?

28:37.400 --> 28:40.051
Just make sure you keep the
bottom of my cup covered.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.810
Whatever.

28:50.280 --> 28:51.441
You're a student, huh?

28:53.120 --> 28:54.610
What you studying?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.047
Engineering.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.761
Industrious.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.410
You remind me of my girl.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.724
She's not a student,
you understand,

29:08.800 --> 29:10.484
more of what you call
an entrepreneur.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.367
She's a couple years
your junior, I guess.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.003
She's legal,
before you ask, though.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.210
Grass on the field and all that.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.010
How about you just keep to
yourself down there, all right?

29:20.080 --> 29:21.286
I'll see to it that
your coffee stays full.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.646
You don't remember me, huh?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.404
I was here last night
around the same time

29:24.480 --> 29:25.845
with my boss, couple others.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.365
I remember.

29:27.440 --> 29:29.886
I was with one man, mostly
talking about your hat.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.361
My hat?

29:32.440 --> 29:33.851
Where'd you get it?

29:34.520 --> 29:35.965
Uh, Louisville, I believe.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.121
You ain't certain?

29:38.920 --> 29:40.331
Louisville.
Mmm.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.289
Lot of hipsters
out that way, huh?

29:44.560 --> 29:47.370
Yeah, we got a lot
where I'm from, too.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.807
I guess that's how
it is nowadays, huh?

29:49.920 --> 29:51.490
How much you pay for it?

29:52.840 --> 29:54.763
Um... $80 something.

29:55.520 --> 29:57.010
Sold American!

30:02.400 --> 30:03.401
You owe me $20.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.726
You want to buy my hat?

30:06.280 --> 30:07.691
What else are we talking about?

30:08.600 --> 30:10.329
Look, you don't want to go
all the way to Louisville,

30:10.400 --> 30:11.880
I bet you can order one
off a website.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.081
I don't want to order one.

30:13.160 --> 30:15.040
I... I want the one that
you got on right there.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.041
Well, you can't just come in
a place and tell a guy

30:19.120 --> 30:20.920
you're buying something
that he's not selling.

30:21.560 --> 30:22.971
You wouldn't think so.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.084
I'm not giving you my hat.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.404
I know. I'm buying it.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.086
All right, you know what?

30:34.160 --> 30:35.520
I think it's time
for you to leave.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.607
I have to take that hat off him.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.163
It's liable to get damaged.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.125
They tend to lose their shape,

30:44.200 --> 30:47.090
you know, when you get
too rough with them.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.885
Maybe I ought to call the cops.

31:03.520 --> 31:06.126
You're doing a piss-poor
job keeping my coffee full.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.450
What you say?
You like it?

31:30.480 --> 31:33.165
Yep. You're right.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.168
On second thought, I just
don't think it suits me.

31:42.920 --> 31:45.161
Damn shame to be
going home empty-handed.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.804
Way this day's going,

31:51.920 --> 31:54.764
I'm likely to end up in the
doghouse with my girl.

31:58.720 --> 32:03.009
I figure if I'm gonna work
back into her good graces,

32:04.480 --> 32:06.926
it'd pay to not come home
empty-handed.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.969
What you say, hon?

32:18.960 --> 32:21.201
You got anything worth taking?

32:25.320 --> 32:27.766
No matter how I play this
out in my mind,

32:27.880 --> 32:29.962
I have a hard time
seeing Boyd confess.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.929
I said I will
get him to confess.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.331
I heard what you said.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.200
Raylan, if I didn't
know any better,

32:36.240 --> 32:37.480
your tone might suggest

32:37.600 --> 32:40.171
you doubt the power of
my feminine wiles.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.811
- No, no indeed.
- Good.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.770
'Cause I recall
a time not so long ago

32:45.840 --> 32:49.322
when you yourself were held
sway by those very same wiles.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.890
Is that what that was?

32:50.960 --> 32:55.010
Although you
did manage to

32:55.080 --> 32:57.560
resist well enough
to throw me over.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.642
- Ava...
- You ever wonder

32:59.720 --> 33:02.087
how things could be
different if you hadn't?

33:04.240 --> 33:07.369
If you hadn't left this place
when I was 16?

33:10.400 --> 33:12.846
Never saw much point
in that kind of wondering.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.604
If you'd taken me with you?

33:17.400 --> 33:18.640
You're standing at the clearing,

33:18.720 --> 33:20.848
Boyd pulls up in his truck,
transfers the money in here...

33:20.920 --> 33:22.120
What's the first thing you say?

33:22.440 --> 33:23.601
"Hey, Boyd."

33:23.920 --> 33:24.921
After that.

33:26.840 --> 33:30.242
I ask him what
really happened to Dewey.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.642
Just like that?

33:32.720 --> 33:35.200
The thing about getting a man
to do what you want, Raylan,

33:35.280 --> 33:38.124
it's not so much what you
say <i>as</i> how you say it.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.923
Or what you're
doing at the time.

33:43.640 --> 33:44.846
I want to trust you, Ava.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.526
I can tell.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.045
You ask him, he won't say.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.167
He Will.

33:50.240 --> 33:53.403
He... Say he won't.
What then?

33:53.480 --> 33:56.290
I guess then I'll start
taking my clothes off.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.044
Hope I still got what it takes

33:58.120 --> 34:00.691
to drive all other
thoughts from a man's mind.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.040
I want to trust you.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.645
You told me that already.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.201
You Okay?

34:19.480 --> 34:20.811
Ask me later.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.641
Well, ain't this the conundrum?

34:33.520 --> 34:36.330
Somebody's always
got to go first.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.161
Now, it's clear
that I've held up my end.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.161
What say we verify
you've held up yours?

34:45.760 --> 34:47.170
Go on.

35:12.680 --> 35:13.681
Oh.

35:38.560 --> 35:42.565
Now, what say we see

35:42.640 --> 35:45.883
if we can all ride off
into our respective sunsets?

35:47.240 --> 35:48.571
Katherine.

35:53.920 --> 35:54.920
Boyd!

35:54.960 --> 35:56.291
Katherine.

36:14.960 --> 36:18.567
Oh. Uh, ripping you off...

36:19.560 --> 36:22.211
That was her idea
from the jump...

36:22.600 --> 36:25.206
Payback for you
murdering her husband.

36:25.760 --> 36:27.285
I just, uh...

36:29.320 --> 36:31.641
I just thought
you ought to know.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.730
Whoo! Whoo!

36:44.800 --> 36:46.006
Oh!

36:50.320 --> 36:52.129
Baby, it's me!

36:52.200 --> 36:53.725
On, baby!

36:55.760 --> 36:58.525
Do you really think
I had Grady murdered?

37:00.600 --> 37:01.761
I did.

37:03.040 --> 37:04.326
I don't any longer.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.931
So...

37:09.800 --> 37:11.404
What happens now?

37:17.880 --> 37:19.484
Are you gonna kill me?

37:48.000 --> 37:49.889
Oh!

37:51.640 --> 37:52.926
I am sorry, Boyd.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.849
Oh, baby, let's
have that conversation

37:54.960 --> 37:58.043
when we're sitting on a beach
with the sand between our toes.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.366
Baby?

38:11.640 --> 38:15.201
Jesus, woman.
What did you do?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.570
He was never gonna confess.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.523
Put that gun down.
You ain't gonna shoot me.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.681
I shot Boyd.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.405
Put it down and step away.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.891
If I don't, would you shoot me?

38:30.440 --> 38:32.090
Let's not find out.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.446
I gave you what you
always wanted, Raylan...

38:36.240 --> 38:37.844
Boyd Crowder
bleeding at your feet.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.405
I can't go back to prison.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.204
So you're gonna
have to shoot me,

38:46.280 --> 38:47.600
or you're gonna
have to let me go.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.241
Last time you ran...

38:50.320 --> 38:51.845
Remember how that went?

38:51.920 --> 38:56.050
Last time I ran, I didn't have $10
million to help me disappear.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.610
I'm going to come after you.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.641
I know.
