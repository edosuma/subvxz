01:24.421 --> 01:28.972
<i>The forests of Pandora hold many dangers.</i>

01:34.632 --> 01:38.294
<i>But the most dangerous thing about Pandora,</i>

01:41.837 --> 01:45.839
<i>is that you may grow to love her too much.</i>

01:56.975 --> 02:00.269
<i>We sing the song chords to remember.</i>

02:00.270 --> 02:02.974
<i>Each bead, a story in our life.</i>

02:04.742 --> 02:08.103
<i>A bead for the birth of our son.</i>

02:11.889 --> 02:13.680
Neteyam!

02:13.681 --> 02:15.824
Neteyam!

02:22.263 --> 02:26.221
<i>A bead when we adopted our daughter, Kiri,</i>

02:26.222 --> 02:29.387
<i>born of Grace's avatar,</i>

02:29.388 --> 02:32.387
<i>a daughter who's conception
was a total mystery.</i>

02:46.845 --> 02:48.928
<i>A bead for the first communion with Eywa.</i>

02:52.886 --> 02:57.134
<i>The people say we live in Eywa,</i>

02:57.135 --> 02:59.552
<i>and Eywa lives in us.</i>

03:01.802 --> 03:06.801
<i>The great mother holds
all her children in her heart.</i>

03:14.801 --> 03:18.132
<i>Happiness is simple.</i>

03:18.133 --> 03:21.133
<i>But who would've thought a
jarhead like me could crack the code.</i>

03:24.758 --> 03:27.424
When I met your father...

03:27.425 --> 03:29.090
...I tried to kill him.

03:29.091 --> 03:31.173
It was love at first sight.

03:31.174 --> 03:34.174
Before I knew it, we had four.

03:36.799 --> 03:40.797
<i>When we sent the sky people
back to Earth, a few of them stayed.</i>

03:40.798 --> 03:44.839
<i>Science guys loyal to the Na'vi.</i>

03:44.840 --> 03:48.588
<i>And then there was Spider.
He was just stuck here.</i>

03:48.589 --> 03:50.421
<i>Too young for a cryocapsule.</i>

03:50.422 --> 03:51.475
-You wild man.

03:51.476 --> 03:52.672
-Hey Norm.

03:52.673 --> 03:55.004
<i>Orphaned by the war, he
was raised by the lab guys.</i>

03:55.005 --> 03:56.171
Spider, take your spare!

03:56.172 --> 03:58.627
I'm just going to the village.

03:58.628 --> 04:00.868
<i>He wasn't part of our family.</i>

04:00.869 --> 04:04.795
<i>He was like a stray cat just always around.</i>

04:04.796 --> 04:07.796
<i>Inseperable from our kids.</i>

04:10.458 --> 04:14.151
<i>To Neytiri he would always be alien.</i>

04:14.152 --> 04:15.711
<i>One of them.</i>

04:15.712 --> 04:18.337
He belongs with his own kind.

04:22.670 --> 04:23.960
It's mine!

04:23.961 --> 04:25.376
I had it first!

04:25.377 --> 04:26.876
Why do I have to give it to you?

04:26.877 --> 04:27.711
<i>Took a few years to get the language</i>

04:27.712 --> 04:28.960
<i>through my thick skull.</i>
- It's mine!

04:28.961 --> 04:30.543
Lo'ak, you liar! Give it to me!

04:30.544 --> 04:31.502
<i>But now when I hear it,</i>

04:31.503 --> 04:33.168
<i>might as well be English.</i>

04:33.169 --> 04:34.792
I hate you!

04:34.793 --> 04:38.792
I hate you times
infinity! Lo'ak! Penis face!

04:38.793 --> 04:41.375
-Hey, hey, that's enough.

04:41.376 --> 04:43.209
-Don't make me come over there.

04:43.210 --> 04:45.709
He's gonna come out
from behind those big rocks.

04:45.710 --> 04:47.792
There he is.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.294
There you go. Go get it.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.811
Neteyam, the mighty fisherman.

04:55.812 --> 04:57.874
Good boy.

05:00.958 --> 05:04.269
- It's a big one.
- By the rocks, right

05:04.270 --> 05:06.457
where you said.

05:06.458 --> 05:09.497
- How tall is he?
- He's that tall.

05:09.498 --> 05:13.831
<i>Goes by too fast. Like a dream.</i>

05:13.832 --> 05:17.747
- Kiri.
- Come here, bro.

05:17.748 --> 05:19.580
Smile, skxawng.

05:19.581 --> 05:21.581
<i>Happiness is simple.</i>

05:24.241 --> 05:28.330
<i>Like date night, time away from the kids.</i>

05:58.558 --> 06:00.786
<i>But the thing about happiness.</i>

06:03.192 --> 06:06.052
<i>It can vanish in a heartbeat.</i>

06:10.801 --> 06:14.190
<i>A new star in the night.</i>

06:14.191 --> 06:17.190
<i>That could only mean one thing.</i>

06:23.190 --> 06:26.189
<i>Ships decelerating.</i>

06:34.189 --> 06:37.478
<i>Sky People returning.</i>

08:55.176 --> 08:59.176
<b>One Year Later.</b>

09:06.175 --> 09:08.174
-Pulse 168.

09:08.175 --> 09:09.716
Okay, here it comes.

09:09.717 --> 09:13.174
You're fine. Stay calm.

09:15.174 --> 09:17.174
Good pupillary reaction.

09:19.174 --> 09:22.631
Colonel, can you hear me?

09:22.632 --> 09:24.638
Colonel?

09:25.933 --> 09:28.445
You need to lie back down, sir.

09:32.798 --> 09:34.255
-Sedate him! Sedate him!

09:34.256 --> 09:36.213
-Get outta here! Go! Go! Go!

09:36.214 --> 09:39.213
- Get security.
- Grab him!

09:39.214 --> 09:43.171
Hold him!
- Calm down, Colonel!

09:43.172 --> 09:45.059
It's me,

09:45.060 --> 09:47.171
Corporal Wainfleet!

09:49.171 --> 09:51.566
Lyle?

09:51.567 --> 09:53.212
That you?

09:53.742 --> 09:55.571
Yes sir,

09:55.572 --> 09:57.170
And Z Dog.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.460
And Fike.

10:02.170 --> 10:03.919
Alright; Let me go.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.915
I'm alright.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.858
Well,

10:28.673 --> 10:30.981
ain't this a bitch.

10:39.209 --> 10:42.457
<i>Stand By. Two minutes to Pandora insertion.</i>

10:42.458 --> 10:44.519
<i>Secure for Delta V.</i>

10:46.166 --> 10:48.165
Alright, umbilical cord is gone.

10:48.166 --> 10:51.165
Pulse Ox 89.

10:51.166 --> 10:55.164
In case you haven't figured it out
yet, you are Colonel Miles Quaritch,

10:55.165 --> 11:00.164
only younger, taller, bluer
and not nearly as good looking.

11:00.165 --> 11:04.163
In two hours I fly a mission
against the Na'vi stronghold.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.580
Powers that be thought it
prudent that I do this backup.

11:07.581 --> 11:09.471
Just in case.

11:09.472 --> 11:15.205
And if you're watching, well it
means I did get my ticket punched.

11:15.206 --> 11:19.162
Hey, Parker; Just what the
hell am I supposed to say now?

11:19.163 --> 11:21.412
Just remind him how this works.

11:21.413 --> 11:23.162
Here.

11:23.163 --> 11:26.370
So see this, this is all your
memories and your personality.

11:26.371 --> 11:30.161
We're gonna send this back to Earth.
Where you are growing in a lab as we speak.

11:30.162 --> 11:31.578
We're gonna imprint you with it.

11:31.579 --> 11:33.911
Hey! Hey! Hey! Am I doing
this, or are you doing this?

11:33.912 --> 11:35.828
- Hurry it up.
- Hurry it up.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.286
Anyway, the idea is,

11:37.287 --> 11:41.160
to get the minds of the
saltiest on world operators.

11:41.161 --> 11:44.572
Yeah, like Corporal Wainfleet over there

11:44.573 --> 11:47.160
and your humble narrator into your

11:47.161 --> 11:49.742
recombinant bodies.

11:49.743 --> 11:54.201
You are a recom now Colonel.
Loaded with my memories and my charm.

11:54.597 --> 11:58.826
What you won't remember is my
death because it hasn't happened yet.

11:58.827 --> 11:59.908
And it ain't gonna.

11:59.909 --> 12:00.909
-Damn right!

12:00.910 --> 12:02.158
-Hell yeah.

12:02.159 --> 12:04.630
Well whatever happened, if you're any clone

12:04.631 --> 12:07.935
of mine, you'll be
looking for some payback.

12:07.937 --> 12:10.936
And Jake Sully would
be at the top of that list.

12:13.741 --> 12:16.782
Remember kid; A Marine can't be defeated.

12:16.783 --> 12:20.155
You can kill us,

12:20.156 --> 12:22.739
but we'll regroup in hell.

12:22.740 --> 12:25.173
Semper fi.

12:54.149 --> 12:56.573
Ground team, go!

13:49.477 --> 13:51.518
Here, go!

13:55.518 --> 13:58.380
Let's go, two minutes people. Let's go.

14:01.518 --> 14:05.808
- Bro, we have got to get down there.
- No way, Dad will skin us.

14:05.809 --> 14:07.808
Come on. Don't be a wuss.

14:07.809 --> 14:10.809
Lo'ak, get back here you!

14:13.808 --> 14:18.085
Taking the whole case, We're
taking mags, the RPGS, the stingers.

14:20.808 --> 14:23.808
- Bro let's go, come on.
- Lo'ak!

14:25.807 --> 14:28.806
Take it. Take a weapon, kid.

14:28.807 --> 14:30.296
Lo'ak;

14:31.090 --> 14:33.806
You don't even know how to use it.

14:33.807 --> 14:36.300
Dad taught me.

14:42.806 --> 14:45.389
Gunships inbound! Fall back!

14:51.805 --> 14:53.805
Come on bro!

15:03.030 --> 15:06.803
Lo'ak, where are you? Neteyam!

15:06.804 --> 15:10.802
Are you okay? Where is your brother.

15:10.803 --> 15:12.803
- Over there.
- Get outta here.

15:14.052 --> 15:15.803
Neteyam!

15:17.803 --> 15:19.803
Oh no.

15:29.802 --> 15:31.573
Dad?

15:33.801 --> 15:36.800
What are you doing here, boy.
What the hell were you thinking?

15:36.801 --> 15:38.996
I'm sorry.

15:39.801 --> 15:41.719
Sorry, sir.

15:44.716 --> 15:48.715
<i>We're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

15:48.716 --> 15:51.715
We're going to Pandora.

15:52.564 --> 15:57.563
I know you are all asking
yourselves the same question.

15:58.766 --> 16:01.715
Why so blue?

16:04.714 --> 16:09.713
For our sins of our past life, we have
been brought back in the form of our enemy.

16:09.714 --> 16:14.467
That gives us their size,
their strength, their speed.

16:14.468 --> 16:16.888
And with our training,

16:16.889 --> 16:19.712
That's a pretty potent mix.

16:19.713 --> 16:23.712
- We have a mission yet?
- Indeed we do.

16:23.713 --> 16:28.711
Our mission is to hunt down and
kill the leader of the Na'vi insurgency.

16:28.712 --> 16:32.711
The one they call "Toruk Makto".

16:32.712 --> 16:35.130
Jake Sully.

16:42.711 --> 16:46.710
Attack, attack! Got you!

16:46.711 --> 16:48.710
Come on now, Tuk.

16:48.711 --> 16:50.459
I'm definetly faster when I'm blue.

16:50.460 --> 16:51.841
You skawng.

16:51.843 --> 16:53.709
Seriously, and the animals respect me more.

16:53.710 --> 16:57.626
- They don't think of me as human.
- Wait, you're human?

16:57.627 --> 16:58.710
Ha ha.

17:06.999 --> 17:08.709
They are coming!

17:08.710 --> 17:13.707
<b>THE FORTRESS OF THE OMATIKAYAS.</b>

17:13.708 --> 17:15.707
They're coming! Kiri! Spider!

17:15.708 --> 17:19.707
The war party is coming back. Come on!

17:19.708 --> 17:21.410
Come along.

17:35.706 --> 17:38.706
- Mom!
- Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.

17:40.706 --> 17:42.706
Fall in!

17:43.751 --> 17:45.866
You're supposed to be spotters.

17:45.867 --> 17:47.788
You spot bogeys and call them in.

17:47.789 --> 17:49.334
From a distance!

17:49.336 --> 17:53.544
Does that sound familiar? Jesus,
I let you two geniuses fly a mission.

17:53.546 --> 17:55.704
And you disobey direct orders.

17:55.705 --> 17:58.655
Kiri, can you go help your
grandmother with the wounded.

17:58.675 --> 18:00.703
My brother is wounded.

18:00.705 --> 18:04.704
- Tuk, go with her. Go!
- Father, I take full responsibility.

18:06.506 --> 18:10.702
Yes, because you are the
older brother, you gotta act like it.

18:10.703 --> 18:14.191
MaJake, your son is actually bleeding.

18:14.192 --> 18:16.788
Mother, it's fine, I -

18:17.703 --> 18:21.588
Go and get patched up.
Go on, dismissed.

18:25.702 --> 18:29.035
You do understand that you
almost got your brother killed.

18:29.036 --> 18:30.631
-Yes, sir.

18:31.701 --> 18:34.700
You're grounded. No flying for a month.

18:34.701 --> 18:36.509
Now see to the Ikrans.

18:36.510 --> 18:40.606
All of them. And get
that crap off your face.

18:47.700 --> 18:51.309
- Aw! A little kiss on the boo boo.
- Give him this.

18:51.322 --> 18:56.698
- I would use yalnabark.
- Oh you would? And who is Tsahik?

18:56.699 --> 18:58.618
You are, grandma, move.

18:58.619 --> 19:01.408
You are, grandma but yalnabark is better.

19:03.151 --> 19:05.458
It stings less.

19:05.459 --> 19:07.645
Mighty warriors.

19:13.697 --> 19:15.697
What is it?

19:17.697 --> 19:21.696
Neteyam and Lo'ak try to live up to you.

19:21.697 --> 19:24.696
It's very hard for them.

19:24.697 --> 19:27.695
I know.

19:27.696 --> 19:31.970
You are very hard on them.

19:32.696 --> 19:36.694
I am their father. That's my job.

19:36.695 --> 19:41.120
This is not a squad. It is a family.

19:50.512 --> 19:53.694
I thought we had lost him.

20:01.693 --> 20:04.692
- Hi there.
- Hey, Spider.

20:04.693 --> 20:07.692
- Your ass is mine.
- I'm right here.

20:07.693 --> 20:11.691
Avatars only. Go around.

20:11.692 --> 20:14.223
The blue stripes don't
make you any bigger bro.

20:14.224 --> 20:17.376
I can still kick your ass.

20:19.692 --> 20:23.690
- Hell of a day.
- Home run.

20:23.691 --> 20:26.482
Yeah, haha. Real hysterical guys.

20:26.483 --> 20:27.857
You know what really sucks though.

20:27.858 --> 20:29.690
You can breathe Earth air for hours.

20:29.691 --> 20:31.689
I can only breathe your
air for like 10 seconds.

20:31.690 --> 20:35.189
Yes, monkey boy. That really sucks,

20:35.190 --> 20:36.690
For you.

20:42.689 --> 20:44.688
- Hey, Max.
- Hey, kids.

20:44.689 --> 20:46.522
Hey, what's up Max.

20:46.523 --> 20:47.523
Lo'ak.

20:52.689 --> 20:54.688
Hi Mom.

21:03.688 --> 21:08.686
Maybe I'm just losing it out
here but I see real evidence -

21:08.687 --> 21:12.889
of a systemic response on a global level.

21:12.891 --> 21:15.395
I can not...

21:15.397 --> 21:19.395
<i>I will not use the word "intelligence".</i>

21:19.686 --> 21:22.439
<i>"Awareness" is probably a better word.</i>

21:22.506 --> 21:26.505
<i>It's as if the entire biosphere on Pandora</i>

21:26.506 --> 21:32.504
<i>is aware and capable
of this cognitive response.</i>

21:32.505 --> 21:38.628
Oh crap, I can't say
that. They'll crucify me.

21:38.629 --> 21:41.503
So, who do you think knocked her up?

21:41.504 --> 21:45.503
- Pretty sure it was Norm.
- Totally.

21:45.504 --> 21:48.503
- You don't deserve to live.
- Think about it.

21:48.504 --> 21:52.474
He is the teachers pet. He's
out at the lab with her all the time.

21:52.488 --> 21:55.502
I would kill myself. I would drink acid.

21:55.503 --> 21:58.002
Bro, you're right! He's like in every shot.

21:58.003 --> 22:02.126
Look, he's giving her the looks!
- Hey!

22:02.127 --> 22:05.543
See, I'm thinking their two
avatars together out in the woods…

22:05.544 --> 22:07.501
...All alone.
- Gross!

22:07.502 --> 22:12.807
Guys, I mean, Sometimes it's not
so great to know who your father was.

22:16.501 --> 22:19.500
Whatever. I don't even remember him.

22:19.501 --> 22:20.625
No, Spider...

22:20.626 --> 22:21.500
Dude.

22:21.501 --> 22:23.911
Spider...

22:24.500 --> 22:27.500
You are not him.

22:35.499 --> 22:38.499
<b>BRIDGEHEAD CITY.</b>

23:06.997 --> 23:09.495
<i>Go! Go! Go! Inside the terminal!</i>

23:09.496 --> 23:12.496
<i>No stay! Go!</i>

23:14.774 --> 23:17.496
Masks off.

23:21.495 --> 23:24.984
Colonel; It's the general.

23:33.494 --> 23:35.493
General Ardmore.

23:35.494 --> 23:38.128
Nice to meet you, Colonel.

23:38.129 --> 23:40.039
I hear good things.

23:40.041 --> 23:44.040
But a lot has changed since
your last tour here. Walk with me.

23:45.797 --> 23:50.492
The new command center, it's
over here, that just came online.

23:50.493 --> 23:54.491
The sworn assemblers can
put up a building in six days.

23:54.492 --> 23:59.491
We have done more here in a
year than in the previous thirty years.

23:59.492 --> 24:02.923
We are not here to run a
mine, Colonel. As on world

24:02.924 --> 24:06.491
commander, I have been
charged with a greater mission.

24:10.491 --> 24:13.157
Earth is dying.

24:13.158 --> 24:17.614
Our task here is to tame this frontier.

24:17.615 --> 24:22.489
Nothing less than to make
Pandora the new home for humanity.

24:22.490 --> 24:27.803
But before we can do that,
we need to pacify the hostiles.

24:29.489 --> 24:33.488
Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.

24:33.489 --> 24:35.791
His attacks are well executed. Got tight

24:35.792 --> 24:38.487
coordination between
his ground and air assets.

24:38.488 --> 24:41.306
These forces are hitting our outline sites.

24:41.307 --> 24:44.487
Mines, Pipelines, cutting
off our supply chain.

24:45.012 --> 24:49.011
They hit a mag train two days ago.

24:52.487 --> 24:58.190
- Any intel on Sully's base of operations?
- Yeah. Bring up the mountains.

24:58.487 --> 25:02.585
It's a cave system in the
Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.

25:03.486 --> 25:08.402
But every time we send our
forces up there, we take losses.

25:08.403 --> 25:12.318
Our hardware really
stirs up the hornets nest.

25:12.319 --> 25:16.485
We only get ten minutes in
enemy airspace they are all over us.

25:18.485 --> 25:22.483
Colonel; We believe your blue
team will be perceived as indigenous

25:22.484 --> 25:25.483
and will not trigger the immune response.

25:25.484 --> 25:29.483
And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?

25:29.484 --> 25:32.482
The hard way.

25:32.483 --> 25:35.012
Outstanding.

25:47.482 --> 25:51.482
<i>- We are entering hostile airspace.
- Copy that.</i>

26:01.856 --> 26:04.773
- Go, monkey boy!
- Guys! Wait up!

26:41.477 --> 26:44.191
Tuk, come on!

26:44.193 --> 26:45.476
Okay, okay.

26:45.477 --> 26:47.476
Bro why did you bring her anyway?

26:47.477 --> 26:50.247
She's such a crybaby.

26:50.248 --> 26:52.475
"I'm telling. You're not
supposed to go to the battlefield."

26:52.476 --> 26:54.434
"I'll tell mom if you don't let me come."

26:54.435 --> 26:56.906
Don't pick on her.

26:57.476 --> 26:59.475
Come on.

26:59.476 --> 27:01.333
Oh sick!

27:01.335 --> 27:04.773
Are there any dead bodies up there?

27:49.416 --> 27:51.471
No shit.

28:01.470 --> 28:04.470
Kiri? Kiri.

28:07.470 --> 28:10.559
Kiri. Kiri... Eh, eh.

28:16.469 --> 28:18.059
Are you okay?

28:18.060 --> 28:20.467
I was doing that thing again, wasn't I?

28:20.468 --> 28:23.467
Yeah, you were.

28:23.468 --> 28:24.717
Tuk -Kiri!

28:24.718 --> 28:25.467
Lo'ak -Kiri!

28:25.468 --> 28:27.658
Kiri, we have to get back.

28:27.659 --> 28:28.718
Come on.

28:33.342 --> 28:35.341
What is it?

28:35.342 --> 28:37.933
We're always supposed
to be home by eclipse.

28:39.797 --> 28:43.340
- Way too big for a human.
- Avatars?

28:43.341 --> 28:46.341
Maybe, they're for sure not ours.

28:48.341 --> 28:50.944
- What are you doing?
- Shh, I'm tracking.

29:09.339 --> 29:11.339
Watch your six.

29:14.339 --> 29:16.338
Clear.

29:18.338 --> 29:20.338
Moving up.

29:33.337 --> 29:35.337
Damn.

29:56.335 --> 29:59.333
We are never supposed to come here.

29:59.334 --> 30:01.333
Dad is going to ground you.

30:01.334 --> 30:02.875
- Dad is going to ground you.
- Shhhhh. Stop.

30:02.876 --> 30:04.333
For life.

30:04.334 --> 30:08.334
Bro, we have got to
check this out, let's go.

30:24.332 --> 30:30.331
Bro, that's where your
dad and my dad fought.

30:30.332 --> 30:33.256
That's your dads actual suit.

30:33.257 --> 30:35.414
Holy shit...

30:35.415 --> 30:40.330
Lyle, see if you can pull
some data off that dashcam.

30:40.331 --> 30:44.329
- Thing is deader than shit, Colonel.
- So were we.

30:44.330 --> 30:47.413
- Better call this in.
- No bro, we're gonna get in trouble.

30:47.414 --> 30:49.115
-Let's go.

30:53.330 --> 30:58.037
- Devil Dog, This is Eagle Eye, over.
- Eagle Eye, send your traffic.

30:58.038 --> 31:00.205
I've got eyes on some guys.

31:00.206 --> 31:03.328
They look like avatars

31:03.329 --> 31:08.619
<i>but they're in full camo and carrying
AR's. There are six of them; over.</i>

31:08.620 --> 31:11.327
What's your pos; over?

31:11.328 --> 31:14.328
We are at the old shack.

31:16.328 --> 31:18.326
Who's we?

31:18.327 --> 31:22.326
Me, Spider, Kiri...

31:22.327 --> 31:24.327
and Tuk.

31:28.326 --> 31:32.034
Son, you listen to me very
carefully. Pull back right now.

31:32.035 --> 31:33.325
Do not make a sound.

31:33.326 --> 31:36.950
- Get the hell out of there. Move, copy?
- Yes sir, moving out.

31:36.951 --> 31:39.324
-See I told you.

31:39.325 --> 31:41.840
Dad, I know a quick way!

31:47.325 --> 31:50.448
- You're going to be in so much trouble.
- Kiri, stop.

31:50.449 --> 31:53.201
- Guys, come on.
- It's almost eclipse, come on.

31:55.324 --> 31:59.323
- Put it down or I'll shoot you!
- With me.

31:59.324 --> 32:01.323
- Drop it!
- Right now!

32:03.573 --> 32:05.980
Put it down, put it down.

32:08.323 --> 32:09.660
Get over here.

32:09.661 --> 32:13.321
Down on your knees! Stop fighting.

32:13.322 --> 32:17.138
- Check them for weapons.
- Kiri!

32:18.031 --> 32:20.780
Be calm.

32:20.781 --> 32:23.003
Shut up! Don't move!

32:23.005 --> 32:25.004
What have we here?

32:34.321 --> 32:39.778
Look, Colonel. Check it out.
4 fingers. We've a half-breed.

32:39.779 --> 32:41.487
-Shit.

32:47.361 --> 32:49.779
Show me your fingers.

32:54.319 --> 32:56.319
You're his, aren't you?

32:58.318 --> 33:01.318
You're his alright.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.316
Where is he?

33:09.317 --> 33:12.316
{\an5} Unfortunately I don't speak English -

33:12.317 --> 33:14.316
{\an5} with assholes.

33:14.729 --> 33:17.729
{\an5} Where is your father?

33:22.316 --> 33:25.130
Really? You wanna play it this way.

33:26.316 --> 33:28.152
Shut up!

33:30.316 --> 33:33.883
Kiri!
- No! Stop! Hey! Hey!

33:33.884 --> 33:36.314
Don't touch her!

33:36.315 --> 33:38.315
Don't hurt her, please.

33:40.315 --> 33:43.314
- Don't move.
- What's your name, kid?

33:45.314 --> 33:49.314
Spider, Socorro.

33:57.313 --> 33:59.313
Miles?

34:01.272 --> 34:04.312
Nobody calls me that.

34:06.312 --> 34:08.339
I'll be damned.

34:08.853 --> 34:12.139
I figured they sent you back to Earth.

34:13.312 --> 34:16.311
You can't put babies in cryo, dip shit.

34:22.311 --> 34:24.741
What do we do, boss?

34:26.310 --> 34:29.310
Iron Sky, Blue on Actual.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.371
Blue on Iron Sky, send your traffic.

34:35.371 --> 34:38.308
<i>We are standing by for extract, over.</i>

34:38.309 --> 34:40.683
- Take us in.
- Dragonfly coming left.

34:40.684 --> 34:42.600
-We are go for extract.

34:42.601 --> 34:44.891
Be advised. We're bringing
high value prisoners.

34:44.893 --> 34:46.309
Let us go!
- Shut up!

34:46.310 --> 34:49.371
Sit tight, we're inbound.

34:49.371 --> 34:50.842
Bingo in ten.

34:50.844 --> 34:52.844
<i>We're on the clock.</i>

34:57.308 --> 35:00.307
Lyle, get me some audio on this.

35:03.307 --> 35:05.531
It's Sully's woman.

35:05.532 --> 35:07.306
She's a wild animal.

35:07.307 --> 35:10.306
Give up, Quaritch.

35:10.307 --> 35:14.305
- Sully.
- It's all over.

35:14.306 --> 35:17.305
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

35:17.306 --> 35:20.570
I was hoping you would say that.

35:36.304 --> 35:39.387
- You stay with the Ikrans.
- Dad, I'm a warrior like you.

35:39.388 --> 35:40.345
I'm supposed to fight.

35:40.346 --> 35:41.303
-Neyteyam.

35:41.304 --> 35:43.242
I won't say it again.

35:44.303 --> 35:46.303
Yes, sir.

36:08.301 --> 36:11.301
There is nothing after that.

36:23.300 --> 36:26.300
Should we salvage the remains?

36:52.297 --> 36:55.296
<i>Blue 1, we'll be there in three minutes.</i>

36:55.297 --> 36:57.297
Three minutes.

37:12.296 --> 37:14.739
Watch our 6.

38:01.841 --> 38:03.616
Shut up!

38:18.290 --> 38:19.290
Shut up.

38:21.289 --> 38:23.289
Contact made!

38:26.506 --> 38:28.289
Lo'ak!

38:32.288 --> 38:34.287
You little shit!

38:34.288 --> 38:36.616
Tuk, come on!

38:36.617 --> 38:38.558
Race!

38:45.287 --> 38:47.286
Come along!

38:47.287 --> 38:49.287
In cover!

38:52.287 --> 38:53.652
Come now!

39:08.285 --> 39:10.857
Is that you, Mrs. Sully?

39:10.858 --> 39:14.285
I recognize your calling card.

39:23.284 --> 39:27.113
Come on out, Mrs. Sully.

39:27.114 --> 39:30.283
The two of us have
some unfinished business.

39:35.283 --> 39:40.281
Demon! I will kill you as
many times as I have to.

39:40.282 --> 39:44.281
You and the Corporal have
been pretty busy, haven't you?

39:44.282 --> 39:49.281
<i>Got yourself a whole litter of half-breeds.</i>

39:57.865 --> 39:59.281
Na'vi!

40:01.280 --> 40:04.366
Go! Go! Go!

40:05.280 --> 40:07.465
Are you okay, boy?

40:07.466 --> 40:09.535
Follow me. Ready?! Ready?!

40:11.459 --> 40:13.279
Move!

40:17.279 --> 40:18.944
Come on!

40:27.278 --> 40:29.490
Go! Go! Go!

40:29.491 --> 40:31.035
After them!

40:37.277 --> 40:39.005
Spider?

40:42.277 --> 40:44.124
Spider!
- Kiri!

40:44.125 --> 40:45.238
Spider!

40:45.276 --> 40:47.275
Come here!

40:47.276 --> 40:49.276
Spider is down there!

40:55.276 --> 40:58.711
Then we are ahead. We have ten minutes.

40:58.712 --> 41:02.327
Blue 1, back to the collection point.

41:08.274 --> 41:11.273
- Blue 1, fall back.
- Back!

41:11.274 --> 41:13.274
Back, back! Take off!

41:16.274 --> 41:20.272
Kiri, come on! Come on!

41:20.273 --> 41:22.273
Go, go, run!

41:24.562 --> 41:26.561
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

41:26.563 --> 41:28.563
Tuk, are you hurt?

41:47.271 --> 41:50.270
There we're clear. Is everyone okay?

41:51.050 --> 41:53.050
Tuk!

41:55.270 --> 41:57.269
It's okay.

41:57.270 --> 42:01.055
Thank you, Great Mother, thank you.

42:01.056 --> 42:02.267
Thank you.

42:02.269 --> 42:04.268
Where is Spider?

42:04.269 --> 42:08.268
They took him. They took him.

42:08.269 --> 42:10.328
Take it easy, honey.

42:10.329 --> 42:13.268
He's a tough kid.

42:15.268 --> 42:18.267
He'll be okay.

42:18.268 --> 42:21.268
We're all gonna be okay.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.908
Let me out of here!

42:44.600 --> 42:47.108
He's completely ferile.

42:47.109 --> 42:50.107
He thinks he is one of them.

42:52.599 --> 42:55.069
<i>This thing, this Quaritch, whatever he is,</i>

42:55.070 --> 42:58.597
<i>he can walk right in
here under Eywa's nose.</i>

42:58.598 --> 43:00.376
<i>This is our family. This is our home.</i>

43:00.377 --> 43:02.597
<i>This is our family. It's
about our little ones.</i>

43:02.598 --> 43:05.598
I can not. You can not ask this.

43:07.598 --> 43:10.218
I cannot leave my people.

43:10.219 --> 43:11.596
I will not.

43:11.597 --> 43:13.555
He's hunting us.

43:13.675 --> 43:15.715
He's targeting our family.

43:15.717 --> 43:18.846
You can not ask this.
The children, everything

43:18.847 --> 43:22.595
they've ever known, the
forest. This is our home!

43:22.596 --> 43:23.901
He had our children.

43:23.902 --> 43:26.596
He had them under his knife.

43:32.595 --> 43:36.594
My father gave me this bow as he lay dying.

43:36.595 --> 43:39.628
He said to protect the people.

43:39.629 --> 43:42.593
You are Toruk Makto!

43:42.594 --> 43:44.800
This will protect the people.

43:44.801 --> 43:47.593
Quaritch has Spider and
that kid knows everything.

43:47.594 --> 43:50.593
<i>He knows our whole operation.
He can lead them right in here.</i>

43:50.594 --> 43:55.300
If the people harbor us, they will die.

43:55.301 --> 43:57.969
Do you understand?

44:00.593 --> 44:03.030
I got nothing.

44:03.031 --> 44:05.082
I got no plan.

44:06.231 --> 44:08.507
But I can protect this family,

44:08.508 --> 44:10.400
that I can do.

44:23.591 --> 44:25.933
But I know one thing.

44:27.590 --> 44:32.590
Wherever we go, this
family is our fortress.

44:44.589 --> 44:49.587
<i>- Where's Jake Sully?</i>
- I do not know!

44:49.588 --> 44:53.087
- We know, you know.
- I do not know!

44:53.088 --> 44:55.591
Form a picture in your mind.

44:55.592 --> 44:57.587
Is it one of the floating mountains?

44:57.588 --> 45:01.586
- Let me outta here!
- He's fighting this; Give us a minute.

45:01.587 --> 45:04.586
Form a thought, and we'll see it.

45:04.587 --> 45:10.127
<i>- I do not know!
- I don't like this anymore than you do.</i>

45:10.128 --> 45:11.860
Which clans would be harboring him.

45:11.861 --> 45:14.465
I don't know! You're gonna have to kill me.

45:15.586 --> 45:18.585
Watch this he's peaking all over.

45:18.586 --> 45:20.835
It won't stop until you give us something.

45:20.836 --> 45:22.584
Where is he?

45:22.585 --> 45:24.917
I don't know, you butt holes.

45:24.918 --> 45:27.250
I don't know! Ahrg..Agrh!

45:39.584 --> 45:43.223
General, let me try the personal angle.

45:46.583 --> 45:49.255
He is not your son.

46:19.580 --> 46:22.315
Easy, tiger, easy.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.579
We good?

46:37.579 --> 46:39.378
Kid, you got heart.

46:39.379 --> 46:43.577
The science pukes leaned on you pretty hard

46:43.578 --> 46:47.166
but you gave them nothing.

46:47.168 --> 46:50.168
I respect that.

46:53.734 --> 46:57.707
I thought you might want this.

47:04.240 --> 47:07.824
This is Colonel Miles Quaritch. Deceased.

47:08.065 --> 47:11.065
Killed in action.

47:15.239 --> 47:17.238
I'm not that man.

47:17.885 --> 47:21.885
But I do have his memories.

47:24.239 --> 47:27.237
Enough to know that...

47:27.238 --> 47:30.237
well he wasn't always the best father.

47:30.238 --> 47:33.237
But that is not an apology.

47:33.238 --> 47:37.611
I'm not your father.
Technically, you and I,

47:37.612 --> 47:40.494
we're nothing to each other. But..

47:40.684 --> 47:43.786
I can help you.

47:43.787 --> 47:46.737
I can get you out of here.

47:48.729 --> 47:53.235
I won't ask you to betray Jake Sully.
You would never do that. You are loyal.

47:53.236 --> 47:55.007
And

47:55.008 --> 47:58.234
I admire loyalty.

47:58.235 --> 48:02.234
Now just ride along.

48:02.703 --> 48:06.519
Otherwise I gotta give
you back to the lab coats.

48:14.234 --> 48:18.233
This is like stones in my heart.

48:18.234 --> 48:21.748
Tarsem is young but wise.

48:21.749 --> 48:24.253
He will become a strong olo'eyktan.

48:25.233 --> 48:28.477
The leader must die...

48:31.233 --> 48:34.232
so the leader can be born.

48:35.898 --> 48:38.232
Toruk Makto will disappear.

48:40.232 --> 48:43.867
The people will be safe.

49:08.229 --> 49:11.679
A father protects.

49:11.680 --> 49:14.610
It's what gives him meaning.

49:18.228 --> 49:20.227
One life ends.

49:20.228 --> 49:23.063
Another begins.

49:35.227 --> 49:37.227
Oh, Tuk...

49:41.226 --> 49:44.718
The sea clans inhabit a world of their own.

49:44.719 --> 49:46.577
Thousands of islands.

49:46.579 --> 49:51.224
An unknown area where we will
be able to disappear without a trace.

49:51.425 --> 49:54.241
Are we there yet?

50:18.223 --> 50:21.223
{\an5} <b>AWA'ATLU, IN METKAYINA-VILLAGE.</b>

50:58.219 --> 51:02.218
Hey, leave it.

51:02.219 --> 51:05.218
Follow me.

51:05.219 --> 51:06.659
Tuk.

51:08.218 --> 51:10.217
Behave nicely.

51:10.697 --> 51:12.697
Behave nicely.

51:32.216 --> 51:34.215
Take it easy. Just be cool.

51:34.216 --> 51:36.472
Look, what is that?

51:36.473 --> 51:38.927
Is that supposed to be a tail?

51:54.214 --> 51:57.213
It is then too small to swim with.

51:57.214 --> 52:00.214
Do not, Rotxo and Ao'nung.

52:02.214 --> 52:03.727
Hey.

52:28.211 --> 52:33.210
<i>Tonowari was chief of the
Metkayina, the reef people.</i>

52:33.211 --> 52:37.209
- I see you, Tonowari.
- Jake Sully.

52:37.210 --> 52:40.210
<i>I knew him as a tough leader.</i>

52:43.210 --> 52:46.210
But it wasn't Tonowari that worried me.

52:49.209 --> 52:52.208
I see you, Ronal, Tsahik of the Metkayinas.

52:52.209 --> 52:54.469
I see you, Ronal.

52:56.209 --> 52:58.567
Why do you come to us, Jake Sully.

52:58.605 --> 53:00.607
We seek Uturu.

53:00.609 --> 53:03.114
Uturu?

53:03.115 --> 53:05.776
Asylum for my family.

53:07.208 --> 53:09.414
We are reef people.

53:09.415 --> 53:10.957
You are forest people.

53:10.958 --> 53:13.264
Your skills will mean nothing here.

53:13.266 --> 53:17.266
So we will learn your ways, right?

53:19.207 --> 53:22.205
Their arms are thin.

53:22.206 --> 53:25.517
Their tails are weak.

53:25.518 --> 53:28.424
You will be slow in the water.

53:30.206 --> 53:34.156
These children aren't even true Na'vi.

53:35.205 --> 53:37.205
Yes, we are.

53:40.205 --> 53:42.783
There is demon blood in them!

53:45.858 --> 53:47.398
Look.

53:47.745 --> 53:49.203
Look.

53:49.204 --> 53:54.202
I was born of the sky people
and now I am Na'vi. You can adapt.

53:54.203 --> 53:57.202
We will adapt. Okay?

53:57.203 --> 54:01.202
My husband was Toruk Makto.

54:01.414 --> 54:04.311
He led the clans to victory

54:04.312 --> 54:07.413
over the Sky People.

54:09.202 --> 54:11.624
This you call victory?

54:11.626 --> 54:14.790
Hiding among strangers?

54:17.201 --> 54:20.704
It seems Eywa has turned her back on you,

54:20.705 --> 54:22.922
Chosen One.

54:27.201 --> 54:28.824
I apologize for my mate.

54:28.825 --> 54:32.115
- She has flown a long way and is exhausted.
- Do not apologize for me.

54:32.116 --> 54:33.200
Jake.

54:38.200 --> 54:41.478
Toruk Makto is a great war leader.

54:41.479 --> 54:44.198
All Na'vi people know his story.

54:44.199 --> 54:46.239
But we Metkayina.

54:46.240 --> 54:48.199
-Dad -are not at war.

54:50.198 --> 54:53.197
We can not let you bring your war here.

54:53.198 --> 54:55.698
I'm done with war,

54:55.699 --> 54:57.144
okay?

54:57.146 --> 55:01.145
I just want to keep my family safe.

55:03.197 --> 55:06.197
Uturu has been asked.

55:10.197 --> 55:14.664
- Do we have to go?
- Shh, it will be okay.

55:25.195 --> 55:29.194
Toruk Makto and his
family will stay with us.

55:29.195 --> 55:33.569
Treat them as our brothers and sisters.

55:33.570 --> 55:36.193
But they do not know the sea.

55:36.194 --> 55:41.193
So, they will be like babies
taking their first breath.

55:41.194 --> 55:44.010
Teach them our ways
so that they do not suffer

55:44.011 --> 55:48.050
the shame of being useless.

55:49.193 --> 55:52.192
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

55:52.193 --> 55:54.192
-(quietly) Thank you.

55:54.193 --> 55:58.191
My son Ao'nung our daughter Tsireya
will show your children what to do.

55:58.192 --> 56:00.191
- Father, why?
- It has been decided.

56:00.325 --> 56:04.045
Come, I will show you our village.

56:13.313 --> 56:15.273
This way.

56:18.191 --> 56:20.105
Tuk, let's go.

56:20.106 --> 56:22.340
Just up here.

56:29.815 --> 56:31.771
This is for you.

56:31.772 --> 56:34.188
Your new home.

56:34.189 --> 56:36.188
Yeah, this will work.

56:36.189 --> 56:37.479
This is great.

56:37.480 --> 56:40.665
It's nice right.

56:51.771 --> 56:53.144
Okay, Sully's fall in.

56:53.145 --> 56:54.769
Remember? Family meeting.

56:54.770 --> 56:57.186
- Come on, take a knee let's go.
- Kiri.

56:57.454 --> 56:59.037
What?

57:00.770 --> 57:04.185
I need you kids on your best behavior.

57:04.186 --> 57:05.768
I mean it.

57:05.769 --> 57:08.232
Learn fast, pull your weight,

57:08.233 --> 57:10.768
don't cause trouble, got it?

57:10.769 --> 57:13.077
Yes, sir.

57:14.026 --> 57:16.804
I want to go home.

57:17.768 --> 57:19.767
Oh, Tuk...

57:20.169 --> 57:22.457
Tuk,

57:22.458 --> 57:25.031
this is our home now.

57:26.350 --> 57:28.766
We're gonna get through this.

57:28.767 --> 57:31.891
We're gonna get through this if
we have each others backs, right?

57:31.892 --> 57:36.765
- What does your father always say?
- Sully's stick together.

57:36.766 --> 57:39.435
That's right, Sully's stick together.

57:39.436 --> 57:42.077
This time with some feeling.

57:42.766 --> 57:46.766
- Sully's stick together.
- Sully's stick together.

57:57.765 --> 57:59.577
Come on!

59:35.756 --> 59:37.756
{\an5} Swim together with us.

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:14.876
{\an5} -What's wrong with them?

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.751
{\an5} -They are bad divers.

01:00:16.752 --> 01:00:18.334
{\an5} -Stop.

01:00:18.335 --> 01:00:19.752
{\an5} They're learning.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.344
Are you okay?

01:00:32.345 --> 01:00:34.749
You're too fast! Wait for us.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:36.916
Just breathe.

01:00:36.917 --> 01:00:37.749
Breathe.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:39.769
You are not good divers.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.374
You may be good at swinging through trees.

01:00:42.375 --> 01:00:45.666
- Come on, bro.
- We don't speak this finger talk.

01:00:45.667 --> 01:00:48.165
- We don't know what you're saying.
- I will teach you.

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:49.790
- Where is Kiri?
- Kiri?

01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:50.843
- Who?
- Kiri.

01:00:50.845 --> 01:00:53.094
- Where is Kiri?
- Did you see her?

01:01:03.748 --> 01:01:08.746
Get on the ship, find a
seat, and keep out of the way.

01:01:08.747 --> 01:01:10.888
Let's go!

01:01:10.889 --> 01:01:12.746
Chop Chop.

01:01:12.747 --> 01:01:15.746
Whoa, whoa, hold on there hotshot.

01:01:15.747 --> 01:01:17.939
Listen up.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.745
There is a tracker built into that mask.

01:01:20.746 --> 01:01:22.745
We hit the ground and you take off.

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:24.745
I'll have you back in 2 minutes.

01:01:24.746 --> 01:01:28.243
And I will give you an
old-school ass whooping.

01:01:28.244 --> 01:01:29.745
Understood?

01:01:29.746 --> 01:01:32.744
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

01:01:33.135 --> 01:01:35.876
- We up?
- Teams up.

01:01:49.744 --> 01:01:51.728
Listen up.

01:01:51.729 --> 01:01:55.200
Jake Sully has gone underground.

01:01:55.201 --> 01:01:58.034
Don't matter, wherever
he is, we'll find him.

01:01:58.035 --> 01:02:01.231
And his bat shit crazy wife too.

01:02:01.993 --> 01:02:06.033
To do so. We go Na'vi.

01:02:06.034 --> 01:02:07.741
Full tilt all the way.

01:02:07.742 --> 01:02:09.783
That means we eat Na'vi.

01:02:09.784 --> 01:02:11.491
We ride Na'vi.

01:02:11.492 --> 01:02:13.991
We think Na'vi.

01:02:13.992 --> 01:02:19.324
{\an5}And that starts with
speaking the languiage.

01:02:21.741 --> 01:02:24.365
{\an5} You call that speaking the language?

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:26.907
{\an5} You sound like a three year old.

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.739
Alright, smart guy.

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:35.740
You just went from being our
monkey mascot to official interpreter.

01:02:42.739 --> 01:02:44.581
These are Ilu.

01:02:44.582 --> 01:02:48.737
If you want to live here, you have to ride.

01:02:48.738 --> 01:02:51.738
Make the bond gently.

01:02:55.738 --> 01:03:00.736
Feel his breath. Feel his strength.

01:03:00.737 --> 01:03:02.736
Hold here.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:06.737
- Look at his legs.
- Hold on.

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:28.911
Everything alright, forest boy?

01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:40.792
This is a warriors
mount. Not easy to master.

01:03:40.793 --> 01:03:44.732
Perhaps you should start with an ilu.

01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:46.733
No, this one.

01:03:48.733 --> 01:03:50.908
Now remember,

01:03:50.909 --> 01:03:54.078
when you dive back in, good position,

01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:56.198
very important.

01:03:58.732 --> 01:04:00.732
I got this.

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:28.311
Yes that's it.

01:04:28.312 --> 01:04:30.290
Steady.

01:05:15.725 --> 01:05:18.113
I love her already.

01:05:56.722 --> 01:05:59.721
Breathe in…

01:06:01.721 --> 01:06:04.720
And breathe out.

01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:08.719
Imagine flickering a flame.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.719
You must slow down your heartbeat.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.719
Breathe in.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.719
Breathe from down here.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.697
Breathe out slowly.

01:06:23.718 --> 01:06:27.130
Lo'ak, your heartbeat is fast.
- Sorry.

01:06:27.132 --> 01:06:28.718
- Try to focus.
- Okay.

01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:31.717
Breathe in…

01:06:31.718 --> 01:06:33.763
And breathe out.

01:06:33.764 --> 01:06:36.390
Let your mind go clear.

01:06:53.716 --> 01:06:56.806
You are learning to breathe.

01:07:01.174 --> 01:07:04.114
Come on! Keep up losers!

01:07:17.922 --> 01:07:19.791
I got this.

01:07:25.631 --> 01:07:26.837
What?

01:07:26.838 --> 01:07:31.170
Na'vi kids younger than me
do this with their bare hands.

01:07:31.706 --> 01:07:34.883
Jake Sully do it the hard way?

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:36.825
What do you think?

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:41.832
What do we do, Cololnel?

01:07:45.254 --> 01:07:48.182
This is going to be good.

01:07:50.044 --> 01:07:52.244
Alright, move up.

01:07:58.169 --> 01:08:01.060
It's you and me, cupcake.

01:08:13.167 --> 01:08:17.166
Did I mention you're supposed
to tie the mouth shut first?

01:08:17.167 --> 01:08:19.709
Thanks a lot, kid.

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:25.225
Move up! Move up!

01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:33.548
Can you see them?

01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:59.162
Come on, we have to move on.

01:09:01.162 --> 01:09:03.265
Let's go. Out of here.

01:09:09.162 --> 01:09:11.162
Yes, that's right!

01:09:14.162 --> 01:09:16.161
- That's right, Colonel!
- Get some!

01:09:16.518 --> 01:09:19.517
Whose up next.

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:31.160
The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:40.287
The sea is around you and in you.

01:09:44.158 --> 01:09:48.156
The sea is your home

01:09:48.157 --> 01:09:50.759
before your birth...

01:09:50.761 --> 01:09:53.760
and after your death.

01:09:58.158 --> 01:10:00.837
Our hearts beat

01:10:00.838 --> 01:10:03.553
in the womb of the world.

01:10:04.157 --> 01:10:09.741
Our breath burns in
the shadows of the deep.

01:10:10.157 --> 01:10:12.726
The sea gives

01:10:12.727 --> 01:10:15.682
and the sea takes.

01:10:18.156 --> 01:10:21.527
Water connects all things.

01:10:23.156 --> 01:10:25.823
Life to death.

01:10:27.155 --> 01:10:30.155
Darkness to light.

01:10:32.155 --> 01:10:36.154
- I got it! Tsireya!
- You did it.

01:10:52.445 --> 01:10:56.333
{\an5} This will help you breathe underwater.

01:11:37.792 --> 01:11:40.148
What is she doing?

01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:44.148
- I don't know.
- She's just looking at the sand.

01:11:45.857 --> 01:11:47.356
What did you say?

01:11:47.357 --> 01:11:50.689
Are you some kind of freak?

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:53.529
He asked if you were a freak.

01:11:55.616 --> 01:11:57.146
No.

01:11:57.147 --> 01:12:00.480
Are you sure? I mean,
you are not even real Na'vi.

01:12:00.481 --> 01:12:03.980
Look at these hands. I mean look at them.

01:12:03.981 --> 01:12:07.145
Hey! Back off, fish lips.

01:12:07.146 --> 01:12:12.145
- Another four-fingered freak.
- Look at his little baby tail.

01:12:12.146 --> 01:12:15.145
- Leave us alone!
- He's not normal.

01:12:15.146 --> 01:12:20.144
Look at his tail. It is very cute.

01:12:20.145 --> 01:12:23.144
You heard her. Leave them alone.

01:12:23.145 --> 01:12:26.144
Big brother coming to-

01:12:26.145 --> 01:12:29.092
Back off.

01:12:29.093 --> 01:12:31.370
Now.

01:12:35.144 --> 01:12:37.644
It's your choice.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:42.143
And from now on, I need
you to respect my sister.

01:12:45.336 --> 01:12:47.143
Let's go.

01:12:49.309 --> 01:12:51.141
Bye bye!

01:12:51.142 --> 01:12:56.141
Look at them, they are
freaks the whole family.

01:12:56.142 --> 01:12:58.335
Lo'ak...

01:12:58.336 --> 01:13:00.577
I got this, bro.

01:13:02.141 --> 01:13:06.349
I know this hand is
funny. Look, I'm a freak.

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:08.140
Alien.

01:13:08.141 --> 01:13:10.307
But it can do something cool.

01:13:10.308 --> 01:13:13.751
Watch, First I tie it really tight. Okay?

01:13:13.753 --> 01:13:15.753
And then…

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.139
It's called a punch bitch. Don't
ever touch my sister again.

01:13:34.138 --> 01:13:36.137
Hold on!

01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:38.550
Stop it!

01:13:40.138 --> 01:13:42.138
That's too stupid!

01:13:44.637 --> 01:13:47.136
Ow, my tail!

01:13:47.137 --> 01:13:50.103
My ear! Let it go!

01:13:50.104 --> 01:13:52.917
He's got my ear!

01:13:56.574 --> 01:13:59.616
What was the one thing
I asked. The one thing.

01:13:59.617 --> 01:14:02.031
Stay out of trouble. Right.
- It was my fault.

01:14:02.032 --> 01:14:04.719
I don't think so, you've gotta stop
taking the heat for this knucklehead.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.676
Look dad, Ao'nung was picking on Kiri.

01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:09.757
He called her a freak.

01:14:12.135 --> 01:14:14.968
- Go apologize to Ao'noung.
- What?

01:14:14.969 --> 01:14:18.133
-He is the chiefs son. Do you understand?

01:14:18.144 --> 01:14:21.139
I don't care how you do
it. Just go make peace.

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.144
Just go.

01:14:29.133 --> 01:14:33.132
- So what did the other guys look like?
- Worse.

01:14:33.133 --> 01:14:36.132
- That's good.
- A lot worse.

01:14:36.133 --> 01:14:38.229
Get outta here.

01:14:49.132 --> 01:14:52.130
What is wrong?

01:14:52.131 --> 01:14:54.678
Nothing. I'm fine.

01:14:54.679 --> 01:14:57.891
Why should I not be fine?

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:08.129
Why can't I just be like everyone else?

01:15:08.452 --> 01:15:10.452
Oh, Kiri.

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:16.129
What's tree boy doing here?

01:15:19.129 --> 01:15:23.360
Sorry, I hit you, so many times.

01:15:29.003 --> 01:15:31.498
We should be friends.

01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:36.017
Come hunting with us outside the reef.

01:15:36.018 --> 01:15:39.126
It's where the men hunt.

01:15:39.127 --> 01:15:41.274
No way, I'm not allowed.

01:15:41.275 --> 01:15:44.126
I must be asking the wrong brother.

01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:47.641
Let's do it.

01:16:00.125 --> 01:16:01.639
Come on!

01:16:11.124 --> 01:16:14.117
Keep up, forest boy.

01:16:17.124 --> 01:16:21.123
{\an5} <b>Three Rocks Brothers.</b>

01:16:28.123 --> 01:16:30.581
You lived.

01:16:30.582 --> 01:16:33.121
That was insane cuz.

01:16:33.122 --> 01:16:36.988
This way, I know a good spot.

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:49.768
{\an5} Call the fish.

01:17:05.119 --> 01:17:07.119
{\an5} What a moron.

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:29.366
Hey, guys!

01:17:29.367 --> 01:17:30.367
Hey!

01:17:33.117 --> 01:17:35.116
Ao'nung!

01:17:35.462 --> 01:17:38.225
Come on, this isn't funny.

01:21:24.055 --> 01:21:26.301
Holy shit.

01:21:55.052 --> 01:21:57.052
You are a tulkun.

01:21:59.510 --> 01:22:02.052
You saved my life. Thank you.

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:05.933
Thank you.

01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:14.051
Buddy, I have no idea what you said.

01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:22.050
They hurt you, didn't they.

01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:27.049
I'll try to pull it out.

01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:29.049
Trust me.

01:23:03.046 --> 01:23:05.046
Friends?

01:23:08.046 --> 01:23:11.046
Yes, we are friends.

01:23:15.045 --> 01:23:16.703
Bro!

01:24:27.039 --> 01:24:29.039
I am sorry.

01:25:08.035 --> 01:25:10.684
What is it baby girl?

01:25:10.685 --> 01:25:12.965
Do you miss Spider?

01:25:15.034 --> 01:25:19.034
Yes, but that's not it.

01:25:21.034 --> 01:25:22.573
Okay.

01:25:23.399 --> 01:25:26.032
What is it then?

01:25:26.033 --> 01:25:29.655
I can feel her, Dad.

01:25:30.478 --> 01:25:33.478
- You feel who?
- Eywa.

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:42.543
I can hear her breathing.
I can hear her heartbeat.

01:25:43.447 --> 01:25:46.031
She is so close.

01:25:46.444 --> 01:25:50.029
She's just there...

01:25:50.031 --> 01:25:53.031
like a word about to be spoken.

01:25:58.031 --> 01:26:02.029
I know you think I'm crazy.

01:26:02.744 --> 01:26:05.991
You're not crazy, honey.

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:12.541
So what does Eywa's heartbeat sound like?

01:26:16.691 --> 01:26:18.816
Mighty.

01:26:25.028 --> 01:26:28.028
Tell him what you told me.

01:26:33.027 --> 01:26:35.724
Do you like looking at the stars?

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:41.026
My father came from a star.

01:26:41.027 --> 01:26:43.994
The one right there.

01:26:46.026 --> 01:26:49.026
- Lo'ak!
- I'm in trouble.

01:26:52.026 --> 01:26:55.779
Go. I will see you again.

01:27:12.024 --> 01:27:14.954
The boy has been found!

01:27:14.955 --> 01:27:17.617
The Sully boy, we found him.

01:27:25.023 --> 01:27:27.479
Let's have a look at you.

01:27:27.737 --> 01:27:32.736
He's fine. He's fine.
It's just a few scratches.

01:27:34.022 --> 01:27:39.615
I pray for the strength that I will not
rip the eyeballs out of my youngest son.

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:41.108
No.

01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:44.790
My son knows better than
to take him outside the reef.

01:27:46.021 --> 01:27:48.153
The blame is his.

01:27:48.452 --> 01:27:50.020
Okay, let's go.

01:27:50.021 --> 01:27:52.158
No.

01:27:52.459 --> 01:27:54.499
It's not Ao'nung's fault.

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.019
It was my idea.

01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:59.842
Ao'nung tried to talk me out of it. Really.

01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:02.675
Lo'ak.

01:28:02.676 --> 01:28:03.726
I'm sorry.

01:28:03.727 --> 01:28:05.649
Come on.

01:28:08.019 --> 01:28:10.019
I got this one.

01:28:12.019 --> 01:28:13.855
Is this true?

01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:16.941
Ao'noung, what were you thinking?

01:28:19.018 --> 01:28:21.058
Dad you told me make
friends with these kids.

01:28:21.059 --> 01:28:22.195
That's all I was trying to do_

01:28:22.197 --> 01:28:24.575
I don't want to hear about it.

01:28:24.576 --> 01:28:27.355
You have brought shame to this family.

01:28:28.527 --> 01:28:29.912
Can I go now?

01:28:29.913 --> 01:28:32.807
Any more trouble, I'll
tie a knot in your tail.

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:34.505
You read me?

01:28:34.506 --> 01:28:37.016
Yes sir. Lima Charlie.

01:28:45.715 --> 01:28:47.254
Where were you?

01:28:47.537 --> 01:28:51.872
Yeah, what happened to
keep an eye on your brother.

01:28:51.874 --> 01:28:54.706
I'm sorry sir.

01:28:57.014 --> 01:29:00.013
Why did you speak for me?

01:29:00.014 --> 01:29:04.014
Because I know what it's like
to be one big disappointment.

01:29:06.014 --> 01:29:08.418
Wish I had been there.

01:29:08.419 --> 01:29:10.771
The ocean blessed you with a gift brother.

01:29:10.777 --> 01:29:16.012
The tulkuns have not returned yet
and anyway no tulkun is ever alone.

01:29:16.013 --> 01:29:18.012
This one was.

01:29:18.013 --> 01:29:23.011
He had a missing fin. Like
a stump on the left side.

01:29:23.012 --> 01:29:26.011
Payakan. It's Payakan.

01:29:26.012 --> 01:29:30.011
- Who is Payakan?
- A young bull who went rogue.

01:29:30.012 --> 01:29:33.343
He is outcast, alone and has missing a fin.

01:29:33.344 --> 01:29:35.867
They say he is a killer.
- No.

01:29:35.868 --> 01:29:40.010
He killed Na'vi and other Tulkuns.

01:29:40.265 --> 01:29:45.009
- Not here, but far to the south.
- No, he's no killer.

01:29:45.010 --> 01:29:50.002
- You're lucky to be alive.
- I'm telling you guys, he saved my life.

01:29:50.005 --> 01:29:53.578
- He is my friend.
- My baby bro...

01:29:53.587 --> 01:29:59.008
The mighty warrior who faced
a killer tulkun and survived.

01:29:59.009 --> 01:30:02.008
You guys aren't listening.

01:30:02.009 --> 01:30:04.673
- I'm listening.
- Lo'ak, come back.

01:30:04.674 --> 01:30:07.257
-You skxawng.

01:30:07.258 --> 01:30:08.874
Payakan!

01:30:10.258 --> 01:30:11.787
Payakan!

01:30:13.258 --> 01:30:15.257
Payakan!

01:30:23.257 --> 01:30:25.976
Good to see you.

01:30:27.256 --> 01:30:31.255
Why are you outcast? What happened?

01:30:32.259 --> 01:30:35.255
{\an5} It's too painful.

01:30:35.256 --> 01:30:39.315
I trust you.

01:30:39.316 --> 01:30:42.012
You can trust me.

01:31:26.251 --> 01:31:29.192
Bro, that's disgusting.

01:31:32.251 --> 01:31:34.250
Faster!

01:32:09.955 --> 01:32:12.415
We are here.

01:32:17.496 --> 01:32:20.266
This is the cove of the ancestors,

01:32:20.267 --> 01:32:23.000
our most sacred place.

01:32:28.245 --> 01:32:32.002
Eclipse is the best time of day to be here.

01:32:44.244 --> 01:32:46.755
This is it.

01:32:46.756 --> 01:32:49.880
This is The Spirit Tree.

01:33:54.196 --> 01:33:57.236
My beautiful daughter.

01:33:57.237 --> 01:33:58.736
Hi Mom.

01:33:58.737 --> 01:34:02.134
I'm so happy to see you.

01:34:02.135 --> 01:34:05.102
But you look troubled.

01:34:07.570 --> 01:34:09.443
Shhh, Shhh, Shhh.

01:34:09.444 --> 01:34:11.891
My sweet girl.

01:34:19.735 --> 01:34:23.075
What is it baby?

01:34:23.076 --> 01:34:25.734
Why am I different?

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:30.674
What does the Great Mother want for me?

01:34:32.234 --> 01:34:35.600
Who was my father?

01:34:37.734 --> 01:34:40.734
Oh, my god...

01:35:03.732 --> 01:35:06.730
- Come on!
- Kiri!

01:35:07.445 --> 01:35:09.445
Kiri!

01:35:10.731 --> 01:35:13.634
What's wrong? What is it?

01:35:13.635 --> 01:35:15.732
It was a seizure.

01:35:15.734 --> 01:35:19.067
Is she breathing?

01:35:21.084 --> 01:35:23.674
Get her to the village.

01:35:23.675 --> 01:35:25.905
Lets go!

01:35:40.728 --> 01:35:44.435
- Good to see you.
- Neteyam, keep them back.

01:35:44.436 --> 01:35:46.727
- How is she?
- Still unconscious.

01:35:46.728 --> 01:35:50.934
There's no bleed, no fracture.

01:35:50.935 --> 01:35:54.064
No signs of Hypoxia.

01:35:58.018 --> 01:36:02.058
<i>But there is interictal
activity in the frontal lobe.</i>

01:36:02.059 --> 01:36:04.192
<i>She definetly had a seizure.</i>

01:36:04.193 --> 01:36:07.016
<i>We can rule out toxins.</i>

01:36:07.017 --> 01:36:10.033
I see that I am not needed here.

01:36:10.034 --> 01:36:12.145
You are Tsahik.

01:36:12.357 --> 01:36:15.163
Remove these things.

01:36:15.164 --> 01:36:16.981
Out! You have done nothing!

01:36:16.983 --> 01:36:19.294
Come on, let's just take a break.

01:36:19.295 --> 01:36:21.980
Hold on I have to take her IV out.

01:36:22.349 --> 01:36:23.961
Tuktirey.

01:36:30.724 --> 01:36:36.347
She said she could feel Eywa,
she could hear her heartbeat.

01:36:36.348 --> 01:36:40.305
- That is classic frontal lobe epilepsy.
- Epilepsy?

01:36:40.306 --> 01:36:43.322
You see visions and experiences religious

01:36:43.323 --> 01:36:46.686
ecstasy like the one she described.

01:36:53.138 --> 01:36:56.845
Plugging into The Spirit
Tree is some sort of a trigger.

01:36:56.846 --> 01:37:00.053
You definetly can't let
her do that anymore.

01:37:00.054 --> 01:37:02.053
What? Ever?

01:37:02.054 --> 01:37:03.720
Jake,

01:37:03.721 --> 01:37:06.389
If she seizes underwater again,

01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:08.788
it could kill her.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:18.695
Kiri,

01:37:19.544 --> 01:37:22.240
You are awake.

01:37:26.304 --> 01:37:29.124
Kiri,

01:37:29.125 --> 01:37:32.378
Kiri, my sweet child.

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:34.498
My sweet little girl.

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:37.209
Okay this one "I see you."

01:37:42.467 --> 01:37:45.462
That's what I just said, isn't it?

01:37:46.258 --> 01:37:48.716
Not Naati. Ngaati.

01:37:48.717 --> 01:37:52.923
Okay, it's going out through
the nose or something.

01:37:52.924 --> 01:37:56.948
Boss, one of the patrols
picked up a radar hit.

01:37:56.949 --> 01:37:59.120
A rogue gunship.

01:37:59.122 --> 01:38:02.859
- Where?
- Eastern sea, 2 clicks north.

01:38:04.631 --> 01:38:06.612
Hang on.

01:38:07.715 --> 01:38:11.714
The signal disappeared
out over the open sea.

01:38:11.715 --> 01:38:15.136
But if you project the track,

01:38:15.137 --> 01:38:17.713
it hits this island group.

01:38:17.714 --> 01:38:20.601
That's hundreds of islands.

01:38:20.602 --> 01:38:23.296
That's a big search box. Lots of villages.

01:38:23.297 --> 01:38:25.314
This is our guy.

01:38:25.315 --> 01:38:29.547
Give me ships and aircraft I
will bring you with his scalp.

01:38:39.712 --> 01:38:43.102
- Bogeys, inbound.
- Skipper.

01:38:49.711 --> 01:38:53.711
- All stop. <i>All stop.</i>
- Yes. - Yes.

01:39:12.625 --> 01:39:13.708
-Hey.

01:39:13.709 --> 01:39:15.708
Are you Scoresby?

01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:18.708
Are you the asshole who's
commandeering my ship?

01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:22.068
That would be me.

01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:25.707
The target is pretty much
this whole island group.

01:39:25.708 --> 01:39:28.471
I've never been up there.

01:39:28.472 --> 01:39:31.789
You know those waters Doc.
What kind of indigenous we got?

01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:35.414
Metkayina mostly. Some
Ta'unui, maybe 50 villages.

01:39:35.415 --> 01:39:38.414
Uh you are? Who?

01:39:38.415 --> 01:39:40.527
Ian Garvin,

01:39:40.528 --> 01:39:42.357
marine biologist.

01:39:42.358 --> 01:39:46.955
50 villages, 100 villages I
don't care we'll search them all.

01:39:46.956 --> 01:39:48.953
I hunt tulkuns.

01:39:48.954 --> 01:39:51.413
That's what I'm rigged
for. That's all my guys do.

01:39:51.414 --> 01:39:54.037
I have quotas to meet..

01:39:54.038 --> 01:39:57.004
I'll be nice once,

01:39:57.005 --> 01:39:58.833
and then I won't.

01:40:00.704 --> 01:40:03.747
If you can't get out of it,

01:40:03.748 --> 01:40:05.885
get into it.

01:40:05.887 --> 01:40:08.476
All crews at their stations!

01:40:08.477 --> 01:40:10.535
Hey, don't touch.

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:13.412
- Now bring her up, flight speed.
- Flight speed.

01:40:24.619 --> 01:40:27.164
What was that?

01:40:27.165 --> 01:40:29.451
What's going on?

01:40:30.829 --> 01:40:33.463
The Tulkuns have returned!

01:40:33.464 --> 01:40:36.476
Everybody, our brothers
and sisters have returned.

01:40:45.909 --> 01:40:49.064
<i>In their endless cycle of migration.</i>

01:40:49.065 --> 01:40:52.010
<i>The Tulkun had come home.</i>

01:40:56.908 --> 01:40:59.828
Kiri, come on. Come on.

01:40:59.829 --> 01:41:03.344
Tuk, leave me alone.
- ¿What?

01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:07.044
What do you want?
- Look!

01:41:07.045 --> 01:41:08.853
Look!

01:41:15.281 --> 01:41:17.097
Come on.

01:41:17.098 --> 01:41:19.030
Let's go meet them.

01:41:19.031 --> 01:41:22.186
Look, It's my spirit sister.

01:42:18.025 --> 01:42:21.607
{\an5} Sister, I see you.

01:42:21.608 --> 01:42:24.275
{\an5} I see you, sister. I am happy.

01:42:30.274 --> 01:42:34.106
{\an5} Your son is very beautiful.

01:42:34.107 --> 01:42:37.731
{\an5} Thanks. How is your baby?

01:42:37.732 --> 01:42:40.148
{\an5} My baby is strong.

01:42:42.513 --> 01:42:44.189
{\an5} I met a boy.

01:42:44.190 --> 01:42:48.730
<i>It was a time for stories
of their season apart.</i>

01:42:48.731 --> 01:42:51.595
<i>Of death and births.</i>

01:42:53.022 --> 01:42:56.157
<i>Of old friends and new loves.</i>

01:43:11.563 --> 01:43:14.145
<b>TA'UNUI-VILLAGE.</b>

01:43:18.171 --> 01:43:20.170
Be calm.

01:43:20.172 --> 01:43:23.894
We are looking for weapons,
radios, technical equipment.

01:43:24.856 --> 01:43:28.327
Down on your knees!

01:43:28.329 --> 01:43:30.329
Shut up!

01:43:33.394 --> 01:43:38.152
{\an5} We know this man resides
somewhere here on the islands.

01:43:38.154 --> 01:43:40.268
{\an5} Here in this village?

01:43:40.269 --> 01:43:43.976
{\an5} We are a totally different clan.

01:43:43.977 --> 01:43:47.141
{\an5}This man in the
picture is from the forest.

01:43:47.142 --> 01:43:50.224
- What is he saying?
- They never saw him, these are sea people.

01:43:50.225 --> 01:43:52.058
Forest people don't come here.

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:54.675
I ain't buying that.

01:43:58.724 --> 01:44:02.724
{\an5} He must search in the
forest if he is to find that man.

01:44:05.433 --> 01:44:07.690
They don't know anything.

01:44:09.848 --> 01:44:12.524
Shoot that animal.

01:44:14.473 --> 01:44:17.740
What the hell are you doing?!

01:44:19.541 --> 01:44:21.649
Noooo!!

01:44:24.931 --> 01:44:26.888
{\an5} Be calm!

01:44:26.889 --> 01:44:28.903
Are your ears working now?

01:44:28.904 --> 01:44:32.891
Now you have seen what these can do huh.

01:44:34.096 --> 01:44:38.429
Jake Sully. Toruk Makto!

01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:40.429
{\an5} He already told you he knows nothing.

01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:42.430
Put her down!

01:44:45.304 --> 01:44:46.553
Stop! Stop!

01:44:46.554 --> 01:44:49.192
You make it real clear for him.

01:44:49.193 --> 01:44:52.428
If he doesn't give up
Sully, we'll kill the Tsahik.

01:44:52.429 --> 01:44:55.086
- No, I'm not doing that.
- That right?

01:44:55.087 --> 01:44:58.843
I don't want to be part of this.

01:44:58.844 --> 01:45:02.531
These people don't know anything.

01:45:07.427 --> 01:45:09.426
Are we really going to kill her?

01:45:10.078 --> 01:45:12.166
Please, please.

01:45:12.299 --> 01:45:14.252
You must not do that.

01:45:14.253 --> 01:45:17.257
What you are doing here is so wrong!

01:45:17.259 --> 01:45:19.426
Please.

01:45:22.426 --> 01:45:25.094
Burn the hooches.

01:45:25.095 --> 01:45:28.425
- Hey, light them up.
- Light em up!

01:45:41.174 --> 01:45:43.048
{\an5} -I'm sorry.

01:45:43.049 --> 01:45:44.964
{\an5} -I didn't know.

01:45:44.965 --> 01:45:47.548
{\an5} -Stop this madness.

01:45:47.549 --> 01:45:49.413
{\an5}I'm sorry.

01:45:49.414 --> 01:45:51.422
We're out of here.

01:45:51.423 --> 01:45:53.584
Don't touch me!

01:45:53.585 --> 01:45:54.423
I'm sorry.

01:45:54.424 --> 01:45:56.423
- Let's go.
- Saddle up.

01:46:22.379 --> 01:46:25.919
- What's wrong?
- Sky people.

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.959
They're looking for you JakeSully South.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:33.322
They have a human boy who speaks Na'vi.

01:46:36.544 --> 01:46:39.012
Did they kill anybody?

01:46:39.013 --> 01:46:41.293
Not yet.

01:46:41.294 --> 01:46:43.017
They threaten,

01:46:43.018 --> 01:46:46.918
but the villagers will not tell
them where you are on my order.

01:46:54.918 --> 01:46:57.241
We must hunt this demon.

01:46:57.242 --> 01:47:01.249
Trap him, kill him.

01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:03.916
We've gotta be smart.

01:47:03.917 --> 01:47:07.445
If we attack Quaritch, they
are gonna know where we are,

01:47:07.446 --> 01:47:10.790
and they're gonna come
here with everything they got.

01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:13.915
Then what is our plan.

01:47:13.916 --> 01:47:17.182
We are looking for Toruk Makto!

01:47:17.183 --> 01:47:19.549
Has he been here?

01:47:22.915 --> 01:47:25.316
This shit ain't working.

01:47:25.317 --> 01:47:26.955
Nah, they're stone walling us.

01:47:26.956 --> 01:47:30.151
If we turn up the heat he's
just gonna keep running.

01:47:30.153 --> 01:47:33.203
We have to draw him out.

01:47:41.163 --> 01:47:43.045
I'm over it.

01:47:43.046 --> 01:47:45.912
I've got quotas to meet.

01:47:45.913 --> 01:47:48.134
Do you want to hunt?

01:47:48.135 --> 01:47:49.912
Let's hunt.

01:47:49.913 --> 01:47:52.911
What? Here? Not here.
There's too many villages.

01:47:52.912 --> 01:47:55.911
No. No no no.

01:47:55.912 --> 01:47:58.382
Respectfully sir. You do not understand the

01:47:58.383 --> 01:48:01.077
kindred bonds between the
Tulkun and the ocean Na'vi.

01:48:01.078 --> 01:48:03.910
It would be like murdering
a member of their family.

01:48:03.911 --> 01:48:07.910
If we start hunting here, the
hostiles will come after us.

01:48:07.911 --> 01:48:09.784
Exactly.

01:48:09.785 --> 01:48:12.764
One hostile in particular.

01:48:21.826 --> 01:48:25.866
I know how you feel.

01:48:25.867 --> 01:48:30.908
I feel all alone too.

01:48:30.909 --> 01:48:32.603
Tell me.

01:48:32.604 --> 01:48:35.436
Why are you outcast?

01:50:56.896 --> 01:50:59.565
I am sorry.

01:50:59.566 --> 01:51:01.895
I'm so sorry.

01:51:04.895 --> 01:51:07.895
It is okay.

01:51:21.769 --> 01:51:24.315
You allowed this.

01:51:24.684 --> 01:51:29.396
You allowed him to bond with the outcast.

01:51:31.101 --> 01:51:33.271
Tsireya...

01:51:33.272 --> 01:51:36.557
You disappoint me, daughter.

01:51:36.558 --> 01:51:40.070
And you are the son of a great warrior.

01:51:40.071 --> 01:51:41.622
Who has been taught better.

01:51:41.635 --> 01:51:44.343
Payakan saved my life
sir. You don't know him.

01:51:46.355 --> 01:51:48.225
Sit.

01:51:49.099 --> 01:51:51.099
Sit.

01:51:52.849 --> 01:51:54.522
Sit down!

01:51:58.098 --> 01:52:02.097
Hear my words, boy.

01:52:02.098 --> 01:52:04.140
In the days of the first songs,

01:52:04.141 --> 01:52:07.097
the tulkuns fought among themselves...

01:52:07.098 --> 01:52:11.304
...for territory and for revenge.

01:52:11.305 --> 01:52:13.984
But they came to believe

01:52:13.985 --> 01:52:16.675
that killing, no matter how justified

01:52:16.677 --> 01:52:19.759
only brings more killing.

01:52:20.804 --> 01:52:24.763
So, killing was forbidden.

01:52:24.765 --> 01:52:28.897
This is the Tulkun way.

01:52:29.013 --> 01:52:31.713
Payakan is a killer

01:52:31.714 --> 01:52:34.636
and so he is outcast.

01:52:34.637 --> 01:52:36.988
I'm sorry sir, but you are wrong.

01:52:36.989 --> 01:52:42.440
Lo'ak; You are speaking to the Olo'eyktan.
- That's enough!

01:52:45.802 --> 01:52:48.425
I know what I know.

01:52:50.594 --> 01:52:53.041
That's enough.

01:52:53.551 --> 01:52:56.409
I'll deal with this one.

01:53:01.301 --> 01:53:04.154
The storm will pass.

01:53:04.425 --> 01:53:06.003
Lo'ak;

01:53:06.004 --> 01:53:08.341
I saw something today.

01:53:08.342 --> 01:53:12.383
I saw a forest boy chosen by Tulkun.

01:53:12.384 --> 01:53:15.090
I am very proud of you.

01:53:15.091 --> 01:53:17.641
Payakan didn't kill those boys.

01:53:17.642 --> 01:53:19.090
I saw it all.

01:53:19.091 --> 01:53:20.978
The demon ship killed his mother right in

01:53:20.979 --> 01:53:23.090
front of him, so he
gathered the young bulls

01:53:23.091 --> 01:53:26.067
and the reef boys
together to attack the ship,

01:53:26.068 --> 01:53:28.089
and they were all killed.

01:53:28.090 --> 01:53:31.297
But by the Sky People
not by him. He's not a killer.

01:53:31.298 --> 01:53:36.089
No, Lo'ak, By the Tulkun way
he is, he bears those deaths.

01:53:36.090 --> 01:53:38.711
Will he have to pay for
it for the rest of his life?

01:53:38.713 --> 01:53:42.599
He knows what he did was
wrong. He would never do it again.

01:53:42.601 --> 01:53:45.215
- We must tell my father...
- No, no.

01:53:45.216 --> 01:53:48.373
- I'm in enough trouble with my dad already.
- Your father will understand.

01:53:48.374 --> 01:53:51.420
No. He won't. He doesn't
understand anything.

01:53:51.421 --> 01:53:53.808
The whole clan hates me.

01:53:53.809 --> 01:53:57.700
Demon blood, alien. That's all they see.

01:54:02.254 --> 01:54:05.709
I see you.

01:54:09.087 --> 01:54:13.047
You are brother of Tulkun.

01:54:13.419 --> 01:54:17.165
You are one of us now.

01:54:31.856 --> 01:54:33.769
You got my mother?

01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:36.583
Mother and the calf,
strong signal, range 4000.

01:54:36.717 --> 01:54:39.195
Bring it down in the hull.

01:54:39.196 --> 01:54:41.571
Coming down on it.

01:55:03.332 --> 01:55:06.747
Sub teams, two minutes!
Let's do this. Let's get in there.

01:55:06.748 --> 01:55:08.788
<i>Hatches closed.</i>

01:55:08.789 --> 01:55:10.830
Come on! Hustle! Hustle!

01:55:10.831 --> 01:55:13.651
Crews to their boats! 2 minutes;

01:55:13.652 --> 01:55:15.372
Let's make some bang.

01:55:15.373 --> 01:55:17.655
Boat crew.

01:55:17.656 --> 01:55:19.122
Get ready.

01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:27.080
All boats in!

01:55:31.079 --> 01:55:33.079
Go!

01:55:43.745 --> 01:55:46.108
We're rolling.

01:56:11.076 --> 01:56:15.075
Standby, depth charges
in. Fire! Fire! Fire!

01:56:37.073 --> 01:56:39.489
What's that? What are they doing?

01:56:39.490 --> 01:56:44.072
There are echolocation
sensors, with which they navigate.

01:56:44.073 --> 01:56:48.071
They keep them afloat
so they don't go deaf.

01:56:48.072 --> 01:56:49.762
Picadors,

01:56:49.763 --> 01:56:52.072
Get in there!

01:57:08.153 --> 01:57:10.662
They're gonna cut the
cow from the rest of the pod

01:57:10.663 --> 01:57:12.569
using the sound cannon.

01:57:12.570 --> 01:57:15.626
They target the mother
because the calf swims slowly

01:57:15.627 --> 01:57:18.069
and she won't leave the calf.

01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:20.131
Do they ever fight back?

01:57:20.132 --> 01:57:22.849
No, never seen 'em lift a fin.

01:57:22.851 --> 01:57:25.885
Tough bastards to kill though.

01:57:25.887 --> 01:57:29.014
Submarine teams, go!

01:57:39.610 --> 01:57:43.691
- There we have the lady.
- Target in sight. Harpoons ready.

01:57:43.692 --> 01:57:46.358
Here we go baby.

01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:49.040
So we go in from below,

01:57:49.041 --> 01:57:51.718
where there's gaps in the armor.

01:57:53.754 --> 01:57:55.236
All right, lets go.

01:57:55.238 --> 01:57:59.238
- Okay, that's it now.
- Get me really close.

01:58:02.066 --> 01:58:05.064
- Hold it steady.
- Arm one.

01:58:05.065 --> 01:58:07.587
Armed.

01:58:07.588 --> 01:58:10.064
And... rolling!

01:58:15.092 --> 01:58:16.712
Arm one.

01:58:17.835 --> 01:58:19.159
Fire!

01:58:22.064 --> 01:58:24.231
- Good strike.
- Arm two.

01:58:26.063 --> 01:58:29.420
Booyah!

01:58:29.421 --> 01:58:32.447
3-6, you owe us a beer.

01:58:34.688 --> 01:58:40.061
The bags slow her down and
pull her up towards the surface.

01:58:40.062 --> 01:58:45.061
Bring me closer! Very close. 30 meters.

01:58:45.329 --> 01:58:48.060
Explosive tarpoon

01:58:48.061 --> 01:58:51.449
10 meters. Get me all the way in there.

01:58:51.451 --> 01:58:56.451
Keep the boat steady! Hold, hold on.

01:59:05.435 --> 01:59:09.479
Hold on to your ponytail, Colonel.

01:59:18.059 --> 01:59:21.059
- Full power back!
- Yes.

01:59:28.058 --> 01:59:30.058
Hold her!

01:59:33.057 --> 01:59:36.498
She takes an explosive
harpoon to the chest,

01:59:36.499 --> 01:59:39.460
but she keeps running.

01:59:39.461 --> 01:59:41.624
Beautiful.

02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:57.300
We can only get to the gland from below,

02:00:57.301 --> 02:01:00.264
so we drill up through the palate

02:01:00.266 --> 02:01:03.265
and into the brain.

02:01:05.799 --> 02:01:09.798
These are highly intelligent
beings. Probably smarter than us.

02:01:09.799 --> 02:01:13.047
- Not smarter than me.
- Then the bar is set low.

02:01:13.048 --> 02:01:16.047
I'm the one with the harpoon.

02:01:16.048 --> 02:01:17.993
And yes.

02:01:28.047 --> 02:01:30.380
How do you know they are smarter than us?

02:01:30.381 --> 02:01:33.849
They have more neurons, more pathways.

02:01:33.891 --> 02:01:38.045
Not only are they smarter,
but also deeply emotional.

02:01:38.046 --> 02:01:40.046
More spiritual.

02:01:43.046 --> 02:01:47.044
The area here corresponds
to our emotional center,

02:01:47.045 --> 02:01:50.808
but is proportionally much larger.

02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:55.502
They have music, philosophy, mathematics

02:01:55.528 --> 02:01:58.043
and a complex language.

02:01:58.044 --> 02:01:59.580
Okay,

02:01:59.581 --> 02:02:01.249
Here we go.

02:02:01.250 --> 02:02:03.949
Show me the money.

02:02:07.044 --> 02:02:10.134
So that's what this is all about?

02:02:10.135 --> 02:02:12.011
That's it.

02:02:12.012 --> 02:02:14.150
Amrita.

02:02:15.043 --> 02:02:17.602
Bad luck for the big guys.

02:02:17.603 --> 02:02:20.208
This stuff just happens
to stop human aging.

02:02:20.209 --> 02:02:22.500
Like stops it.

02:02:25.042 --> 02:02:31.040
Ounce for ounce, the single most
valuable substance known to man.

02:02:31.041 --> 02:02:36.623
This little vial here is
worth like 80 million.

02:02:36.624 --> 02:02:39.040
Think fast!

02:02:39.041 --> 02:02:42.039
Please, don't; It's never funny.

02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:47.039
Amrita is what's paying for
everything here on Pandora now.

02:02:47.285 --> 02:02:50.431
Even your research, Dr. G.

02:02:50.432 --> 02:02:52.708
That's why I drink.

02:02:53.664 --> 02:02:55.603
That's all you take?

02:02:55.604 --> 02:02:59.038
You just waste the rest?

02:02:59.039 --> 02:03:01.194
Drop the bags.

02:03:01.195 --> 02:03:03.038
Let's sink her.

02:03:03.039 --> 02:03:06.533
No, leave the bags alone.

02:03:06.534 --> 02:03:08.037
I want them to know it was us.

02:03:08.038 --> 02:03:12.008
I charge extra for being used as bait.

02:03:46.035 --> 02:03:50.033
Her name is Ro'a.

02:03:50.034 --> 02:03:53.034
She was my spirit sister.

02:03:55.159 --> 02:03:59.033
She was the composer of songs.

02:03:59.034 --> 02:04:03.032
Much revened, we would sing together.

02:04:03.033 --> 02:04:07.456
She waited many breeding
cycles to have this calf.

02:04:07.458 --> 02:04:11.273
The clan was so happy for her.

02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:15.710
What's is this, Tonowari?

02:04:17.032 --> 02:04:20.366
What is this?!!

02:04:38.613 --> 02:04:41.769
My spirit sister and her baby

02:04:41.770 --> 02:04:45.611
have been murdered by the sky people.

02:04:45.612 --> 02:04:48.486
The war has come to us!

02:04:48.487 --> 02:04:51.611
<i>We knew about this
hunting of our tulkun people</i>

02:04:51.612 --> 02:04:54.986
but it was over the horizon far away.

02:04:55.132 --> 02:04:58.429
Now it is here!

02:05:00.611 --> 02:05:04.027
You have to understand
how the sky people think.

02:05:04.028 --> 02:05:07.609
They don't care about the great balance.

02:05:07.610 --> 02:05:09.609
Now listen to him.

02:05:09.610 --> 02:05:11.943
The Sky People are not gonna
stop. This is only the beginning.

02:05:11.944 --> 02:05:15.318
You've got to tell your Tulkuns to leave.

02:05:15.319 --> 02:05:17.608
You gotta tell them to go far away!

02:05:17.609 --> 02:05:20.108
Leave?

02:05:20.109 --> 02:05:22.524
You live among us,

02:05:22.525 --> 02:05:24.275
and you learned nothing.

02:05:24.276 --> 02:05:27.608
We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

02:05:27.609 --> 02:05:30.607
No no no.

02:05:30.608 --> 02:05:33.399
If you attack, if you fight.

02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:35.357
Then they will destroy you.

02:05:35.358 --> 02:05:38.316
They will destroy everything that you love.

02:05:38.317 --> 02:05:41.606
Hear my words! Hear my words!

02:05:41.607 --> 02:05:44.606
Stay calm!

02:05:44.607 --> 02:05:47.109
- Now listen to my father.
- Damn it.

02:05:47.110 --> 02:05:50.293
He speaks the truth.

02:05:57.606 --> 02:06:00.605
Tell the tulkuns,

02:06:00.606 --> 02:06:04.105
that if they are hit by one of
these, they are marked for death.

02:06:06.939 --> 02:06:11.604
Call for me and I'll silence it.

02:06:11.605 --> 02:06:15.354
Saving their lives, that's
all that matters, right?

02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:20.604
Saving your family.

02:06:32.603 --> 02:06:35.601
Tell the Tulkun.

02:06:35.602 --> 02:06:38.171
Go. Go.

02:06:41.602 --> 02:06:44.393
We must fight.

02:06:44.394 --> 02:06:46.080
MaJake...

02:06:46.081 --> 02:06:48.600
I will not stand and do nothing.

02:06:48.601 --> 02:06:50.459
It's a trap, they want us to hit back.

02:06:50.549 --> 02:06:53.672
They aren't hunting Tulkuns.

02:06:53.673 --> 02:06:56.261
They are hunting us.

02:07:09.349 --> 02:07:11.408
You're not going anywhere, little brother.

02:07:11.409 --> 02:07:13.598
I have to warn Payakan.

02:07:13.599 --> 02:07:16.598
No. You've got to keep
your skxawng ass here.

02:07:16.599 --> 02:07:19.723
He is outcast. There's no
one else to warn him but me.

02:07:19.724 --> 02:07:21.490
Bro;

02:07:21.791 --> 02:07:24.274
Why do you always have
to make things so hard.

02:07:25.598 --> 02:07:29.130
No, you mean why can't
I be perfect son like you?

02:07:29.814 --> 02:07:32.888
The perfect little soldier.

02:07:32.889 --> 02:07:35.136
Well I'm not you!,

02:07:35.137 --> 02:07:36.596
Okay?

02:07:36.597 --> 02:07:38.223
I'm not you.

02:07:38.224 --> 02:07:41.596
He's my brother. I'm going.

02:07:41.597 --> 02:07:45.595
Is he your brother? No, I'm your brother.

02:07:45.596 --> 02:07:47.595
Lo'ak!

02:07:47.596 --> 02:07:49.595
Let go of me.

02:07:49.596 --> 02:07:51.405
Lo'ak!

02:07:51.406 --> 02:07:54.104
Come on, he's going to Payakan.

02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:07.427
Come back!

02:08:07.428 --> 02:08:10.593
- There's Lo'ak.
- Loak!

02:08:10.594 --> 02:08:14.885
- He's going to find Payakan.
- Wait up.

02:08:14.886 --> 02:08:17.049
Hold on.

02:08:24.593 --> 02:08:27.822
All crews to stations.

02:08:27.823 --> 02:08:30.800
Come, let's make some money.

02:08:36.592 --> 02:08:39.590
Payakan! Brother!

02:08:39.591 --> 02:08:40.591
Lo'ak!

02:08:42.341 --> 02:08:44.371
- Lo'ak!
- Wait!

02:08:47.591 --> 02:08:50.589
What's wrong?

02:08:50.590 --> 02:08:52.548
Shit!

02:08:52.549 --> 02:08:55.229
Stay calm; Stay calm.

02:08:55.230 --> 02:08:57.874
I got this.

02:09:02.589 --> 02:09:04.589
Shit!

02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:07.588
Lo'ak!

02:09:07.589 --> 02:09:11.588
Bro, help me! Hurry the ships coming.

02:09:13.963 --> 02:09:16.131
Bro, come on.

02:09:17.588 --> 02:09:19.587
Come on bro.

02:09:19.588 --> 02:09:23.586
Call Dad! Call Dad! Just go, do it.

02:09:23.587 --> 02:09:25.253
-Don't go, wait!

02:09:25.254 --> 02:09:27.586
-Dad... I mean Devil Dog. Do you read me?

02:09:27.587 --> 02:09:30.586
- Did you see where they went?
- Outside the reef.

02:09:30.587 --> 02:09:32.586
- Lo'ak?
- Yes.

02:09:32.587 --> 02:09:35.794
We are with a tulkun who is under attack.

02:09:35.795 --> 02:09:37.585
Gunships inbound.

02:09:37.586 --> 02:09:40.377
- It is 2 clicks out.
- Who is with you?

02:09:40.378 --> 02:09:43.585
All of us, Ao'nung and Tsireya
too. We're at Three Brothers Rocks.

02:09:43.586 --> 02:09:45.954
Get to cover and do not engage. Alright?

02:09:45.955 --> 02:09:48.459
You hear me? Do not engage. We are coming.

02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:50.418
- Yes, sir.
- It's getting closer!

02:09:50.419 --> 02:09:53.584
3, 2, Pull!

02:09:53.585 --> 02:09:55.757
The kids are under attack.

02:09:55.758 --> 02:09:58.583
They're defending a
tulkun. It's your kids too.

02:09:58.584 --> 02:10:00.375
- The Demon Ship?
- Yes!

02:10:00.376 --> 02:10:01.583
We gotta go!

02:10:01.584 --> 02:10:04.584
Weapons! Sound the alarm!

02:10:07.125 --> 02:10:10.198
- You should stay back.
- I'll ride!

02:11:00.579 --> 02:11:04.929

02:12:36.570 --> 02:12:38.488
No depth charges.

02:12:38.489 --> 02:12:41.569
The kids are worthless to me dead.

02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:43.615
Hold your fire.

02:12:48.569 --> 02:12:53.068
Circle them. Launch the submarines.

Stop moving!

02:16:45.548 --> 02:16:48.171

They have our children. Your daughter,

Tuk, Lo'ak...

02:18:03.250 --> 02:18:07.248
Jake, tell your friends to back off.

02:18:07.249 --> 02:18:12.249
If you want your children,
you will come forward alone.

02:18:14.249 --> 02:18:18.038
You know better than to test my result.

02:18:21.248 --> 02:18:23.973
I took you under my wing, Jake,

02:18:23.974 --> 02:18:26.246
and you betrayed me.

02:18:26.248 --> 02:18:28.144
You killed your own.

02:18:28.145 --> 02:18:29.896
Good men and women.

02:18:29.897 --> 02:18:33.704
I will not hesitate to execute your kid.

02:18:33.705 --> 02:18:35.992
Just wait one.

02:18:46.245 --> 02:18:48.245
Hold here.

02:18:48.245 --> 02:18:50.795
They are killers of Tulkun.

02:18:50.796 --> 02:18:54.244
They must die. Here, today.

02:18:54.245 --> 02:18:57.852
It's me that they want. That's
what all this has been about right.

02:18:57.855 --> 02:19:01.767
The hunting Tulkuns and taking of our kids.

02:19:03.244 --> 02:19:05.659

Then, it is me who has to do this.

02:19:18.243 --> 02:19:22.242
Offers fixing to expire. What will it be?

02:19:22.243 --> 02:19:24.775

- Easy shot.
- You hit him now, they attack.

02:20:08.529 --> 02:20:11.391
Wait until he's on board.

02:20:37.236 --> 02:20:39.236
Payakan!

02:20:50.235 --> 02:20:52.820

Come on, sit up!

02:22:45.224 --> 02:22:48.880
Somebody shoot something!

02:23:03.223 --> 02:23:05.662
Stop!

02:24:00.218 --> 02:24:02.217
After them!

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:22.216
Leak! Masks on!

02:25:01.212 --> 02:25:03.212

02:25:41.209 --> 02:25:43.055
Are you ok?

02:26:12.206 --> 02:26:14.561
Port for the bow!

02:26:14.562 --> 02:26:16.204
Hard to port!

02:26:16.412 --> 02:26:19.204
Get me a shot.

02:26:19.205 --> 02:26:21.754

Get us away!

02:26:39.548 --> 02:26:41.202
Not responding.

02:26:41.203 --> 02:26:43.302
Cut the cable!

02:26:43.303 --> 02:26:46.217

02:27:09.201 --> 02:27:11.199
We are wrecked.

02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:14.254
Take your water pumps on.

02:27:14.255 --> 02:27:16.199
Man your weapons!

02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:21.199
- Otherwise, I thought you were so clever.
- Close the food gap, Garvin.

02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:25.198
Where did you go, you cunning Satan?

02:27:25.199 --> 02:27:29.673
You probably think you're cunning, huh?

02:27:43.198 --> 02:27:45.396
Because!

02:34:51.992 --> 02:34:54.455
Where are your sisters?

02:34:55.159 --> 02:34:57.823
Your sisters! Where are they?!

02:34:57.824 --> 02:34:59.491
- I do not know.
- Where are they?!

02:34:59.492 --> 02:35:02.115
-On the ship. They are tied up on the ship.

02:35:02.116 --> 02:35:04.383
They are at the moon pool.

02:35:04.384 --> 02:35:06.323
On the well deck, amidships.

02:35:06.324 --> 02:35:09.572
- What?
- Come, I'll show you.

02:35:09.573 --> 02:35:12.559
Answer me, Corporal.

02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:16.322
Spit it out or there will be consequences.

02:35:16.323 --> 02:35:18.697
I have heard you.

02:35:18.698 --> 02:35:22.404
Come on, we have to go.

02:35:22.405 --> 02:35:24.863
Come on.

02:35:24.864 --> 02:35:27.765
Listen to me. Listen to me.

02:35:28.572 --> 02:35:30.622
Listen to me. Listen to me.

02:35:30.623 --> 02:35:32.487
They have our daughters.

02:35:32.488 --> 02:35:34.280
They have our daughters.

02:35:36.571 --> 02:35:39.925
I need you with me

02:35:39.926 --> 02:35:42.438
and I need you to be strong.

02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:44.551
Right now.

02:35:44.553 --> 02:35:45.857
Strong heart.

02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:48.452
Strong heart.

02:36:01.319 --> 02:36:03.569
Let's go get our daughters.

02:36:17.734 --> 02:36:20.221
Stay with your brother.

02:36:20.222 --> 02:36:22.363
I want to go with you.

02:36:23.567 --> 02:36:26.437
You have done enough.

02:36:26.438 --> 02:36:28.456
Dad...

02:36:30.983 --> 02:36:33.565
Hold fire.

02:36:33.566 --> 02:36:35.357
Let's go.

02:36:35.358 --> 02:36:37.283
He's coming.

02:36:38.524 --> 02:36:40.823
I'm good, go, go!

02:36:41.565 --> 02:36:45.548
Let's get this guy. That's
why we came here for.

02:36:49.356 --> 02:36:52.563
- Stay with him.
- No!

02:36:52.564 --> 02:36:55.625
Be careful, guys.

02:37:15.562 --> 02:37:17.586
Go.

02:37:24.561 --> 02:37:26.602
- Where are they?
- The middle deck.

02:37:26.603 --> 02:37:29.802
There is like a pool in the center.

02:37:29.803 --> 02:37:32.521
They are at the fort railing.

02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:36.302
No, no; Stay here.

02:37:37.894 --> 02:37:40.106
Talk to me, Corporal.

02:37:40.107 --> 02:37:43.406
The ship is sinking and your
girls are going down with it.

02:37:44.518 --> 02:37:46.780
Your son didn't have to die.

02:37:46.781 --> 02:37:49.323
It was your own fault.

02:37:54.559 --> 02:37:59.628
You thought you could protect
your family, but you can't.

02:38:00.392 --> 02:38:03.738
Only one way to keep em safe.

02:38:05.767 --> 02:38:09.956
So let's get this over with
before you lose another kid.

02:38:20.556 --> 02:38:23.174
Get down!

02:39:04.677 --> 02:39:06.551
- Who is affected?
- Zdinarsik, copy?

02:39:06.552 --> 02:39:08.510
Clear.

02:39:08.511 --> 02:39:12.093
Prague, are you there?

02:39:12.094 --> 02:39:13.510
Look up!

02:39:22.510 --> 02:39:23.551
Forward!

02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:27.508
To the left!

02:39:27.509 --> 02:39:28.799
To the right. Surround her.

02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:31.037
Who's got eyes.

02:40:15.755 --> 02:40:17.772
MaJake!

02:40:22.545 --> 02:40:24.668
It's mother!

02:40:30.545 --> 02:40:32.472
That's right.

02:40:32.473 --> 02:40:34.949
They are coming for you.

02:41:24.540 --> 02:41:25.915
Dad, dad!

02:41:29.373 --> 02:41:32.216
Where is your sister?
Where is she? Where is she?

02:41:32.218 --> 02:41:33.502
That way.

02:41:33.504 --> 02:41:35.468
Stay behind me.

02:41:39.538 --> 02:41:41.537
Kiri!

02:41:41.538 --> 02:41:44.169
Running out of time here, Corporal.

02:41:45.038 --> 02:41:48.537
You already lost one kid today.
You really want to lose another?

02:41:48.538 --> 02:41:51.152
Do not test me!

02:41:52.079 --> 02:41:54.495
Just kill him, dad!

02:41:54.496 --> 02:41:56.495
Kiri!

02:41:56.496 --> 02:42:00.504
- Put down your weapons.
- Don't do that!

02:42:02.036 --> 02:42:04.331
Kick them away.

02:42:05.495 --> 02:42:07.732
Do it!

02:42:09.286 --> 02:42:11.868
No...

02:42:11.869 --> 02:42:15.034
- Cuff yourself.
- No. No. Don't hurt her okay? Don't.

02:42:15.035 --> 02:42:16.551
Stay there!

02:42:16.552 --> 02:42:19.743
Don't come one step closer.

02:42:19.744 --> 02:42:23.980
- Handcuffs on, now!
- You son of a bitch.

02:42:24.010 --> 02:42:26.972
Please, don't hurt her.

02:42:28.534 --> 02:42:32.742
Release, or I cut.

02:42:34.533 --> 02:42:37.699
What, you think I care about some kid?

02:42:37.700 --> 02:42:39.787
He is not mine.

02:42:39.788 --> 02:42:42.657
We are not even the same species.

02:42:42.658 --> 02:42:45.334
Please don't, don't hurt her.

02:42:45.335 --> 02:42:47.198
Let her go.

02:42:47.199 --> 02:42:51.329
Please, listen to me. Let her go.

02:42:51.331 --> 02:42:53.761
Mom, don't kill him.

02:42:53.762 --> 02:42:56.277
A son for a son.

02:42:57.865 --> 02:43:00.094
Please, don't hurt her.

02:43:01.490 --> 02:43:05.531
- I cut.
- Now just let her go, okay?

02:43:07.530 --> 02:43:08.947
No!

02:43:17.530 --> 02:43:20.060
Kiri, Kiri...

02:43:26.529 --> 02:43:28.802
Spider!

02:43:28.803 --> 02:43:31.240
Get them out of here.

02:43:31.242 --> 02:43:33.692
Come with me.

02:43:33.693 --> 02:43:36.071
I owe you a death.

02:43:37.487 --> 02:43:41.526
Mom, come on. Mother!

02:43:41.527 --> 02:43:43.952
You're not leaving, are you, Jake?

02:43:44.014 --> 02:43:48.485
You know I never give up.

02:43:48.486 --> 02:43:53.942
I will come and kill your whole family.

02:43:53.943 --> 02:43:55.816
Dad!

02:43:56.693 --> 02:43:59.051
Then let's get it done.

02:44:08.734 --> 02:44:10.893
Jake!

02:44:12.984 --> 02:44:16.983
- The fire is coming!
- Back to the ship!

02:44:20.399 --> 02:44:22.649
Stay close to me.

02:44:24.982 --> 02:44:27.481
Tuk! Tuk! Tuk!

02:44:27.482 --> 02:44:30.578
Mother, take my hand! Hold on!

02:44:32.315 --> 02:44:34.981
Mom!

02:44:34.982 --> 02:44:37.931
Come on, Kiri; We have to get out of here.

02:44:40.981 --> 02:44:42.980
Climb up!

02:44:42.981 --> 02:44:46.980
Come on, Kiri. Go!

02:44:46.981 --> 02:44:49.980
Swim! Climb up, Tuk!

02:44:57.938 --> 02:44:59.978
Mom.

02:44:59.979 --> 02:45:01.979
- Mom!
- Go, go, go!

02:45:09.728 --> 02:45:11.898
Keep climbing, go.

02:45:14.978 --> 02:45:17.147
I got you!

02:45:18.644 --> 02:45:20.780
Give me your hand!

02:45:22.935 --> 02:45:24.900
Open it up!

02:45:32.392 --> 02:45:35.058
- Open it up!
- Back, back!

02:45:35.059 --> 02:45:36.445
Come on!

02:45:37.767 --> 02:45:38.767
Tuk!

02:45:48.475 --> 02:45:50.975
Up! Come on!

02:45:52.933 --> 02:45:55.974
Climb! Get up!

02:46:01.932 --> 02:46:04.046
We're rolling over! Go, go, go!
- Okay.

02:46:17.972 --> 02:46:20.811
Kiri; Keep going!

02:46:23.930 --> 02:46:26.159
This way!

02:46:30.929 --> 02:46:32.929
Open it up!

02:46:34.929 --> 02:46:35.929
Mom!

02:46:38.928 --> 02:46:40.506
Come on!

02:46:48.970 --> 02:46:51.968
Further, Tuk.

02:46:51.969 --> 02:46:53.969
We can't get out!

02:46:55.927 --> 02:46:58.969
- We'll stay together, okay?
- Yes.

02:47:27.966 --> 02:47:30.966
Oh Great Mother help us!

02:48:13.962 --> 02:48:15.836
Kiri!

02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:36.576
Bro.

02:48:36.577 --> 02:48:39.917
Mom and dad are down there.

02:48:39.918 --> 02:48:41.289
Grab on!

02:48:41.290 --> 02:48:43.458
Bro; I'm ready.

02:49:09.957 --> 02:49:11.248
Okay.

02:49:38.912 --> 02:49:40.733
Jake!

02:50:16.951 --> 02:50:18.730
Dad?

02:50:22.783 --> 02:50:24.641
Fuck.

02:50:37.949 --> 02:50:39.948
Come on, you son of a bitch.

02:50:39.949 --> 02:50:42.948
- Breathe, Dad.
- Neteyam?

02:50:42.949 --> 02:50:44.947
No, it's Lo'ak.

02:50:44.948 --> 02:50:48.947
- Oh, Lo'ak...
- Sorry.

02:50:48.948 --> 02:50:52.025
Neteyam's death is my fault.

02:50:52.026 --> 02:50:55.250
Just focus on getting out.

02:51:12.904 --> 02:51:16.647
The air pocket disappears. We
have to go out. Come on, Dad.

02:51:23.441 --> 02:51:25.367
You know your way out.

02:51:25.368 --> 02:51:28.901
Yes, but Dad it's gonna
be a long breath hold.

02:51:28.902 --> 02:51:30.736
I can't make it.

02:51:30.737 --> 02:51:33.943
But you can. Hurry out.

02:51:33.944 --> 02:51:37.902
I can't lose you too, Dad. Please!

02:51:40.943 --> 02:51:43.942
Mom, I'm scared.

02:51:44.568 --> 02:51:46.254
It's all right.

02:51:46.255 --> 02:51:48.924
Stick with me.

02:51:48.925 --> 02:51:50.373
Stick to mom.

02:51:52.192 --> 02:51:53.887
It's okay.

02:52:08.941 --> 02:52:13.939
You just need to calm your
heart and be completely calm.

02:52:14.263 --> 02:52:18.270
Breathe from down here.

02:52:30.939 --> 02:52:35.937
The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

02:52:35.938 --> 02:52:39.937
The sea is around you and in you.

02:52:39.938 --> 02:52:44.439
The sea is your home before
your birth and after your death.

02:52:48.937 --> 02:52:52.936
The sea gives and the sea takes.

02:52:53.103 --> 02:52:56.433
Water connects all things.

02:52:57.227 --> 02:52:59.423
Life to death.

02:53:00.727 --> 02:53:02.551
Darkness...

02:53:02.552 --> 02:53:04.397
to light.

02:53:25.934 --> 02:53:28.308
- Hi.
- Kiri!

02:53:28.309 --> 02:53:31.292
It'll be fine, little sister.

02:53:31.293 --> 02:53:34.828
Mom, I'm gonna give this to you.

02:53:37.933 --> 02:53:39.932
It will help you.

02:53:39.933 --> 02:53:42.931
Dad, you can do this.

02:53:42.932 --> 02:53:45.642
Trust me.
- Yeah.

02:53:45.643 --> 02:53:47.931
Calm your heart.

02:53:48.534 --> 02:53:50.534
Deep breaths.

02:53:53.514 --> 02:53:55.706
Last breath.

02:53:59.639 --> 02:54:01.438
Follow me.

02:55:16.882 --> 02:55:18.914
Hang on.

02:55:18.915 --> 02:55:21.034
Just breathe.

02:55:24.923 --> 02:55:27.018
Thank you.

02:55:35.130 --> 02:55:37.147
I see you;

02:55:37.148 --> 02:55:38.453
My son.

02:55:40.338 --> 02:55:42.462

02:55:42.463 --> 02:55:45.920

02:55:45.921 --> 02:55:49.086
Come. Come here.

Spider.

02:58:07.034 --> 02:58:09.368
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

02:58:12.324 --> 02:58:14.024
Come here.

02:58:16.408 --> 02:58:18.783

03:00:39.332 --> 03:00:42.774
You, are metkayinas now.

03:00:47.019 --> 03:00:50.976
<i>And there it was.</i>

03:00:50.977 --> 03:00:53.019
<i>We are sea people now.</i>

03:00:55.019 --> 03:00:58.018
<i>This is our home.</i>

03:01:57.763 --> 03:02:01.012
Dad! Look what I caught!

03:02:01.013 --> 03:02:03.303
Wow,

03:02:03.304 --> 03:02:05.094
That's a big crab.

03:02:05.095 --> 03:02:08.226
It was over there by the rocks,

03:02:08.427 --> 03:02:11.170
just like you said.

03:02:14.969 --> 03:02:20.010
What's the matter, dad? Why are you crying?

03:02:20.401 --> 03:02:23.401
I'm just happy to see you.

03:02:25.010 --> 03:02:27.787
I'm happy to see you too.

03:02:29.010 --> 03:02:31.010
You try.

03:02:33.010 --> 03:02:34.921
Okay.

03:02:35.967 --> 03:02:39.009
- Have you left me any?
- Maybe.

03:02:44.967 --> 03:02:48.259
<i>Yeah, check that out!</i>

03:02:54.008 --> 03:02:59.006
<i>I see now. I can't save
my family by running.</i>

03:02:59.007 --> 03:03:02.080
<i>This is our home,</i>

03:03:02.081 --> 03:03:04.506
<i>This is our fortress.</i>

03:03:04.507 --> 03:03:08.007
<i>This is where we make our stand.</i>
