07:56.935 --> 07:58.061
Someone's crabby.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.479
I'm not crabby.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.273
I'm hanging out in the woods
trying to find you a gig.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.567
Very similar to what I do back
in New York, but with ticks.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.527
-And that's why you're grumpy?
-I'm not grumpy.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.654
-You seem grumpy.
-I just want to land
one of these gigs.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.656
-That's it?
-Yeah, that's it.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.244
Plus, the other day,
I turn around for a second

08:14.286 --> 08:16.288
and somebody grabbed
my plunger and uses it.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.582
-Oh, no.
-Doesn't even look to see
if it belongs to anybody.

08:18.624 --> 08:19.875
The fuckin' tag was still on it.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.794
-I'm so sorry.
-Miriam, why are we still here?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.671
I'm making call after call,
nothing's happening.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.006
I'm completely out of change,

08:26.048 --> 08:27.424
and now I have to
disguise my voice

08:27.466 --> 08:28.467
every time I make
a long-distance call.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.552
Why?

08:30.594 --> 08:32.387
Mort Sahl is at the Copa.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.847
Freddy Roman is
at Basin Street East.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.641
Buddy Hackett's at
the Blue Angel.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.892
Your best friend Lenny Bruce

08:36.934 --> 08:38.477
is at Upstairs
at the Downstairs next week.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.103
You know what the common
denominator is?

08:40.145 --> 08:42.022
Those comics are out there
working at clubs.

08:42.064 --> 08:44.524
You're up here in the woods
pretending to be a pony.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.277
And who the fuck takes somebody
else's plunger and uses it?!

08:47.319 --> 08:49.029
What kind of a sick freak
does that?!

08:49.071 --> 08:50.739
I know. I'm sorry.

08:50.781 --> 08:54.451
-What?
-Nothing.

08:54.493 --> 08:55.869
My badminton team
made the semifinals,

08:55.911 --> 08:57.537
and the tournament's
in 25 minutes.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.331
I have to do my pregame
stretches, otherwise I'll...

08:59.373 --> 09:01.792
-Go.
-Fine.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.214
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, any employee

09:07.256 --> 09:08.882
who wants to lead a game
of freeze tag

09:08.924 --> 09:12.552
this afternoon on the main lawn,
see Gil at lunch.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.773
(mouthing)

09:28.568 --> 09:30.487
My parents gave us
matching burial plots

09:30.529 --> 09:31.655
for our anniversary.

09:31.697 --> 09:32.948
Oh, that's so nice.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.574
One less thing
you have to think about.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.743
-Where are they?
-Florida.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.620
I would love to be buried
in Florida.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.372
Doesn't it sound
wonderful, Rose?

09:40.414 --> 09:43.208
You being buried in Florida?
I guess it does.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.253
-Mama...
-She asked a question,
I answered a question.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.171
Moishe's insisting
we get buried in Israel.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.465
I could never be buried
in the desert.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.092
Oh, I do like dates, though.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.969
I never want
this conversation to end.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.345
Time to put you under.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.763
-Leave it alone.
-SHIRLEY: Okay, girls,

09:56.805 --> 09:58.849
talk loud enough
so I can hear.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.809
I don't want to miss
anything juicy.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.186
GOLDIE:
Mrs. Maisel, are you still here?

10:03.228 --> 10:05.188
Oh. There's a call for you.

10:05.230 --> 10:09.401
Oh. Me? Thank you.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.446
-Hello?
-Miriam Maisel, Mrs. O'Toole.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.573
Oh, hello, Mrs. O'Toole.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.491
I know you're on vacation,
but two girls are out sick,

10:16.533 --> 10:18.327
and one quit after I fired her.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.871
I'm shorthanded. If you can
get here by 3:00 today,

10:20.912 --> 10:22.831
I can put you
at the Revlon counter.

10:22.873 --> 10:25.709
-The Revlon counter?
-The Revlon counter.
Can you get here?

10:25.751 --> 10:27.627
Yes, I can. I will.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.546
We're talking about the same
Revlon counter here, right?

10:29.588 --> 10:31.381
There's not a secret counter
on the loading dock

10:31.423 --> 10:33.091
or next to the incinerator,
is there?

10:33.133 --> 10:36.011
There's only one Revlon counter
at B. Altman.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.387
-I will see you at 4:00.
-3:00.

10:37.429 --> 10:40.057
3:00. Better. 3:00.
Thank you.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.558
I'm back in the show.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.143
What? What show?

10:43.185 --> 10:44.603
There's an opening
at the Revlon counter,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.605
but I need to get back
to the city by 3:00.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.566
-Is Papa going back today?
-No. He has no reason to.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.902
Shoot. Bus.
I could take a bus.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.780
-Have you ever taken a bus?
-No, but how hard can it be?

10:54.821 --> 10:56.365
Get on and sit.
I can get on and sit.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.743
Who has a bus schedule?
Anyone have a bus schedule?

10:59.785 --> 11:01.995
What's going on? Who died?
Am I missing something?

11:02.037 --> 11:03.330
No, Shirley, you're not.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.539
How much would a cab ride be?

11:04.581 --> 11:05.916
-A lot?
-Yes.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.834
-Can I walk?
-Have you lost your mind?

11:07.876 --> 11:09.628
It's the Revlon counter, Mama.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.464
My son's going back today.
You could ride with him.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.758
-Benjamin?
-Oh, that's all right,
she's gonna walk.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.927
-Mama, please.
-Miriam, remember,
he wouldn't row.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.470
I only care if he can drive.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.888
Just because he can
doesn't mean he will.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.973
A-Are you sure
he's going back today, and soon?

11:22.015 --> 11:24.101
Every year, Benjamin comes
to the Catskills

11:24.142 --> 11:25.477
with a box of cereal.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.479
When the cereal's done,
he goes home.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.564
He had his last bowl
this morning.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.358
Would you like me to ask him
to drive you back?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.652
-Do you think he'd mind?
-Not at all.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.903
I doubt
he'll even know you're there.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.863
Perhaps if you were
a box of cereal.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.407
I'll call him and tell him
you'll meet him in the driveway.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.909
May I have the phone?
You better hurry.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.994
He really hates
the Catskills.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.330
Thank you, Ida.
Thank you so much.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.873
Mama, I'll be back
as soon as I can.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.625
Ugh.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.335
Spray me.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.213
Thanks.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.924
Revlon counter!

11:57.426 --> 12:00.220
She really likes makeup.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.264
(indistinct chatter)

12:04.641 --> 12:07.102
-Abe.
-One moment, Jerome.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.563
There's a new indentation
on the left side

12:09.604 --> 12:10.647
of the middle third
of the table.

12:10.689 --> 12:11.690
Were you aware of that?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.316
It's just a game, Abe.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.111
Oh, well, why play at all
if it's just a game?

12:16.153 --> 12:17.863
-Oh, boy.
-I play to win.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.614
And to win,
I need information.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.199
I need to determine
my best angles,

12:21.241 --> 12:22.868
velocity, wind resistance.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.579
We're inside, Abe.
There is no wind resistance.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.205
Ha, ha, you'd like me
to believe that,

12:27.247 --> 12:28.874
wouldn't you, Jerome?

12:28.915 --> 12:32.878
Now, let's make sure
this is regulation length.

It's not showing off, it's just
being a god amongst men.

13:05.702 --> 13:06.953
You're amazing, Joel.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.288
All those pins
just flying around

13:08.330 --> 13:09.831
like they were
scared of your ball.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.125
-Could you teach me to do that?
-I can teach you.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.419
How he hell are you gonna
teach her? You can't bowl.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.588
If I can't--
and I'm not saying I can't--

13:16.630 --> 13:18.381
it's only because
I'm spending too much time

13:18.423 --> 13:20.133
running my own
very successful business.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.468
You have your own business?

13:21.510 --> 13:22.844
-Aluminum siding.
-What's that?

13:22.886 --> 13:24.721
It's what you use
to beat yourself to death with

13:24.763 --> 13:26.181
while Robbie tells you
about his business.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.390
(women laugh)

13:27.432 --> 13:29.518
And it's his
father's business, FYI.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.979
-You should talk.
-True. I work for my father.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.564
He manufactures women's clothes.

13:34.606 --> 13:35.857
-Really?
-Shit.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.442
-Do you get discounts?
-Of course.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.569
-Teach me to bowl, Joel.
-It's pretty easy.

13:39.611 --> 13:42.614
I know nothing. I wouldn't know
where to put my fingers.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.992
She wants me to show her
where to put her fingers.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.495
My chances are fair to good.
Let's play.

13:48.537 --> 13:49.788
Thank God.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.790
Listen to me,
you mashugana alta kaka.

13:51.831 --> 13:55.126
You do not tell me
what I should know! I know!

13:55.168 --> 13:56.711
I want what I paid for.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.797
You hear me,
you goddamn schvantz?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.091
Hold on. Hello, putz.

14:01.132 --> 14:04.553
You cheating, lying--
No, no, no, don't even try to...

14:04.594 --> 14:08.139
Abi gezunt dos leben
ken zikh ale mol nemen.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.808
I will not retract that!

14:09.849 --> 14:12.269
-Moishe.
-Hold on. You need a phone?

14:12.310 --> 14:14.020
No, I don't need the phone.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.356
You shouldn't be
conducting work up here.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.358
That is not what
the Catskills is for.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.235
-It's not.
-No.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.945
The Catskills
is a time to unwind.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.280
It's a sanctuary from work.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.740
-Do you see us working?
-I do not see you working.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.534
-There you go.
-I don't see you doing anything.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.287
I see two men
standing around a toy.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.746
It is not a toy.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.082
I apologize if my work
has upset your playtime,

14:34.124 --> 14:35.417
but in my business,

14:35.458 --> 14:37.377
we're not so lucky to get
the whole summer off,

14:37.419 --> 14:38.795
like some people.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.463
We don't have ivory towers

14:40.505 --> 14:42.549
and uncalloused hands.

14:42.591 --> 14:46.761
In my business, a man sweats
and stinks till he dies.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.847
All right, thank you
for explaining that to me,

14:48.888 --> 14:52.976
but I have to insist
that you stop yelling
into two telephones--

14:53.018 --> 14:55.353
because, clearly,
yelling into one isn't enough--

14:55.395 --> 14:57.355
while other people
are trying to relax.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.316
All right, I'm sorry.

14:59.357 --> 15:02.319
I'll tell the two thieves
who were trying to take food

15:02.360 --> 15:04.154
out of my family's mouth
that they win.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.864
-Thank you.
-They can continue

15:05.905 --> 15:08.116
to rape and pillage
as they see fit.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.367
You're still holding two phones.

15:09.409 --> 15:13.038
Fuck you.
I'll call you back. Good?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.372
Great.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.085
-If you'll excuse me.
-JOEL: So you hold the ball up.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.587
RUTHIE:
It's so heavy.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.130
It's seven pounds.
It's a turkey.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.381
You make a turkey?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.926
I make a great turkey.
You would love my turkey.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.678
I'm allergic to turkey.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.222
So, anyhow, you walk up
to the edge of the lane

15:31.264 --> 15:34.934
and throw the ball
toward the pins.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.853
Wow.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.313
You're a natural.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.107
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, Mrs. Greenstein,

15:41.149 --> 15:43.151
your husband is waiting for you
on the main porch.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.612
He says he'll wait
five more minutes.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.115
-Hi.
-Hello.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.408
Thank you so much for this.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.077
You have no idea
how important this is.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.828
Yes, I heard something
about the Revlon counter.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.705
Well, it's more about where
the Revlon counter is.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.540
-Where is it?
-It's in the makeup department.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.126
The makeup department!
You should've told me.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.461
-You sure this is okay?
-What?

16:01.503 --> 16:03.004
You giving me a ride.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.506
Seems like a moral imperative
if we're talking

16:04.547 --> 16:05.674
about the makeup counter.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.133
-Is that all?
-Yes.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.344
BENJAMIN: You travel light.
You'd do well in a covered wagon

16:09.386 --> 16:11.930
or fleeing Egypt.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.890
-Anyone need to go potty?
-MIDGE: I'm fine. Thanks.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.558
BENJAMIN: Lives are at stake.
I don't stop.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.768
MIDGE:
I'm like a camel.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.812
Okay, here we go.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.191
So is there a sale
at the Revlon counter or...?

16:23.233 --> 16:24.609
MIDGE:
Oh, boy.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.404
Abe, I'm begging you,
I'm not a well man.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.948
In such a hurry to lose, Jerome?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.826
Cigar smoking is not allowed
in the rec room, you know that.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.244
JOEL:
Ruthie, focus.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.870
Look down there,
not at me, okay?

16:35.912 --> 16:38.790
-Just aim for the middle pin.
-Like this?

16:38.832 --> 16:41.543
Not till the guy's done
resetting the pins. Jesus.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.420
-Sorry, Bill.
-BILL: That's okay.

16:43.461 --> 16:46.881
Here. Now when the guy's done,
aim for the pins.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.801
-Aren't you gonna watch me?
-Like a fucking hawk.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.010
-You having a good time?
-Sure.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.345
-BILL: Oh, Jesus!
-(pins clatter)

16:52.387 --> 16:55.098
-He wasn't done yet, Ruthie.
-RUTHIE: He looked done.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.934
-Nice girl.
-Sure. Why not?

16:57.976 --> 16:59.769
A lot of nice girls here
this year.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.731
I'll take your word for it.
Avi, you're up.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.567
Nice looking, too.
Girls over there, for example.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.319
Here comes another 8-10 split
from the mighty Gardenswartz.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.822
-(pins clatter)
-They seem very interested
in you.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.115
-Who does?
-The girls.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.869
They want to learn to bowl.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.996
They're flirting.
Why aren't you flirting back?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.330
I let them bowl a frame.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.040
Look, Valentino,
you're single now.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.835
-You're up, Maisel.
-Just in the nick of time.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.879
Hey, smart ass, I'm an old man,
but I know things.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.255
I rarely give you advice.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.132
You remember the last
piece of advice I gave you?

17:29.174 --> 17:31.342
-Don't get the clap.
-Came in handy, didn't it?

17:31.384 --> 17:33.845
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

17:33.887 --> 17:37.098
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, Mrs. Greenstein,

17:37.140 --> 17:39.893
Mr. Greenstein will wait
five more minutes,

17:39.934 --> 17:41.227
but that's it.

17:41.269 --> 17:45.106
No! My calculations must be off.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.650
I need a sharpener.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.652
Sharpener!

17:49.694 --> 17:51.529
NEWS ANNOUNCER:
1959 saw the bird of war

17:51.571 --> 17:53.406
erupting in the Middle East.

17:53.448 --> 17:56.409
In Cairo, cheering crowds
greeted President al-Quwatli

17:56.451 --> 17:58.912
of Syria as he arrived
to sign a pact

17:58.953 --> 18:00.580
with President Nasser of Egypt

18:00.622 --> 18:03.082
establishing
the United Arab League.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.418
The U.S. embassy in Moscow
was a target

18:05.460 --> 18:07.921
of the carefully planned
demonstration to protest

18:07.962 --> 18:10.715
the presence of American troops
in Lebanon.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.842
...who emerged from the welter
of red intrigue

18:12.884 --> 18:14.844
to rule alone with supreme power

18:14.886 --> 18:18.556
after his buddy,
Premier Bulganin, was retiring.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.726
Kamoi loomed large in the news
when the Chinese reds announced

18:21.768 --> 18:24.020
that they were extending their
territorial water limit

18:24.062 --> 18:26.856
to 12 miles,
which took in Kamoi,

18:26.898 --> 18:29.484
a bastion in the defense
of nationalist Formosa.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.252
There are renewed calls today
for real estate developer

18:47.293 --> 18:50.797
Robert Moses to step down
as Chairman of New York City's

18:50.839 --> 18:52.924
committee on slum clearance.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.385
The demands came
after Mr. Moses dismissed

18:55.426 --> 18:57.804
the city's billion dollar
Title One program

18:57.846 --> 19:00.098
as a dead duck.

(radio static)

19:02.475 --> 19:04.185
(radio turns off)

19:06.855 --> 19:09.440
Moses's mother, the only person
in New York City

19:09.482 --> 19:11.818
who still likes him,
came to her son's defense,

19:11.860 --> 19:14.153
insisting that his remark was
misconstrued

19:14.195 --> 19:15.864
and that the phrase "dead duck"

19:15.905 --> 19:18.032
has positive connotations
for him.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.742
She said that
little Robbie Moses

19:19.784 --> 19:22.036
carried his deceased duck
Quackers to school with him

19:22.078 --> 19:24.622
each day for company at playtime
and slept with it at night.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.666
The duck was alive
when it was given to him,

19:26.708 --> 19:27.876
Mrs. Moses clarified,

19:27.917 --> 19:29.460
but little Robert
snapped its neck

19:29.502 --> 19:32.797
when it waddled between him
and a dollar bill.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.592
In other news,
Hawaii is now a state.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.969
A few Jewish women

19:38.011 --> 19:39.929

19:39.971 --> 19:42.390

19:45.184 --> 19:46.561
This just in,

19:46.603 --> 19:48.855
religion is being replaced

Really? Sorry, Susie.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.557
I thought for sure
that was a good tip.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.726
It was a shit tip.
I don't need a shit tip.

20:26.768 --> 20:29.103
I need a real tip that leads
to a real club date.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.563
You work at
the fucking Morris agency.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.357
-In accounting.
-Who cares?

20:32.398 --> 20:34.067

those dicks and their dicks.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.693
You hear them talk.
Now give me something.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.070
I don't know why
I'm helping you.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.196
Because you hate that place.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.572
I hate that fucking place.

20:39.614 --> 20:40.865
And helping me is screwing them.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.493
You know,
I actually used to sing.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.412
Folk songs, show tunes,
did a lot of industrials.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.830
I loved it.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.666
-Well, you must've been great.
-I wasn't bad.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.210
-I was being sarcastic.
-My cousin worked at the agency.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.295
I covered for him while
he went on his honeymoon.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.839
His wife murdered him
in Panama, so...

20:56.881 --> 20:58.716
Fred, I promise,
if you never tell me anything

20:58.758 --> 21:01.010
about your personal life again
and a tip you give me

21:01.052 --> 21:03.054
actually leads to anything,
I will give you a taste.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.889
Now just give me something,
something good,

21:04.931 --> 21:08.518
something that...

21:08.559 --> 21:09.769
Uh...

21:09.811 --> 21:14.148
is here...

21:14.190 --> 21:16.192
in the Catskills,
something soon.

21:16.234 --> 21:18.695
FRED: Oh, I got something.
Does your comic work blue?

21:18.736 --> 21:20.238
She'll work any
fucking color you want.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.156
The Concord may have
a midnight spot available.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.533
It's their dirty spot

21:23.574 --> 21:25.201
and the guy they booked
just found Jesus.

21:25.243 --> 21:26.369
They're looking
for a replacement.

21:26.411 --> 21:27.745
I'll, uh,
I'll get you the number.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.247
-Excuse me? What are you...
-Plunger.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.249
-Oh, sorry.
-Okay, go ahead.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.929
Thank you.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.806
-You're a very decent gentleman.
-Blame my mother.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.183
I'll buy you a drink back in the
Catskills, a thank you drink.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.269
Oh, no. I've done my Catskills
time for the year.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.646
I'm not buying another
box of cereal until January.

21:53.688 --> 21:58.609
Oh. Okay. Well, then I guess,
until next year.

22:00.528 --> 22:01.696
Hey.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.411
I have tickets

22:08.453 --> 22:09.662

to keep them alive.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.420

-Yes. So...

22:17.462 --> 22:20.214
-So...
-Would you like to go?

22:20.256 --> 22:23.634

-I really like the theatre.
-I do, too.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.414

everyone enjoying a story.

23:35.456 --> 23:39.418
-There's electricity in the air.
-Agreed.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.338
And this play, I mean,
it's got everything:

23:42.380 --> 23:45.383
-curtains, lights.
-A floor.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.635
It does have a floor.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.137
-I'm just wondering...
-Yes?

23:49.178 --> 23:51.013
Why did they make a play
about Lizzie Borden?

23:51.055 --> 23:52.473
There's not a lot
of story there.

23:52.515 --> 23:53.683
40 whacks, 41 whacks...

23:53.724 --> 23:56.227
And why did they put the murder
in the first act?

23:56.269 --> 23:58.729
I mean, isn't that the whole
big thing that happens?

23:58.771 --> 23:59.730
Well, the clean up
was quite extensive.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.316
-But what's the second act?
-Oh, no.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.152
-What?
-Act two's a trial.

24:04.193 --> 24:05.570
-Shit!
-I hate trials.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.196
All that ridiculous
Perry Mason crap.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.406
The "I object" and
"Your Honor, may I approach?"

24:08.447 --> 24:10.700
And the banging with the gavel.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.327
-And the righteous
district attorney.
-I hate district attorneys.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.496
And somebody's gonna get up
and give a big dramatic speech.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.415
-Where the actor spits on you.
-They have to spit on you.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.417
-It's not dramatic
unless they spit on you.
-I've been to real trials.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.711
No one gives a dramatic speech,
but they still spit on you.

24:21.752 --> 24:23.337
(bell chimes)

24:23.379 --> 24:24.881
Wait, what are you doing?

24:24.922 --> 24:26.591
I'm finished with it anyhow.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.551
-We're not going back, are we?
-Aren't we?

24:28.593 --> 24:31.053
-No.
-We can't just leave.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.806
Didn't you hear all that stuff
we just said?

24:33.848 --> 24:36.058
Perry Mason, trials,
speeches, spitting?

24:36.100 --> 24:37.310
Yes, but it's a play.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.978
You have to sit through
the whole play.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.230
-Who says?
-The play police.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.149
I am not sitting through
any more of this.

24:43.191 --> 24:45.443
But what if the actors notice
that our seats are empty?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.320
They've seen this play.
They'll understand.

24:47.361 --> 24:49.697
Hell, they expect it. They'll be
confused if we do come back.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.408
I've never walked out
halfway through a play before.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.035
I feel a little dirty,

24:54.076 --> 24:56.245
like-like, we could go back in
and we're not.

24:56.287 --> 24:59.707
I feel so grown up, so alive.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.626
Wait till you throw your program
in the trash.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.461
My God.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.422
My God, my God, my God.
We're leaving.

25:06.464 --> 25:09.842
-Well, don't be a jerk about it.
-Sorry.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.177
Oh, I know where we can go.

25:11.219 --> 25:12.553
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:12.595 --> 25:13.679
please welcome to the stage

25:13.721 --> 25:16.974
the one, the only Lenny Bruce!

25:17.016 --> 25:19.018
(cheers and applause)

25:24.398 --> 25:27.026
LENNY:
All right.

25:27.068 --> 25:30.571
Now, Sunday,

25:30.613 --> 25:34.700
Christ and Moses fly
to New York, transcontinental.

25:34.742 --> 25:38.454
$88 to Chicago, $35 to bet.
All right.

25:38.496 --> 25:40.248
Let's see, they'd say, uh,

25:40.289 --> 25:42.750
"Oh, what's playing
at Saint Pat's?"

25:42.792 --> 25:46.379
Oh, good double-bill,
Spellman and Sheen. Nice one.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.798
♪ Mr. Spellman and Mr. Sheen. ♪

25:48.839 --> 25:51.259
-(vocalizing) All right.
-(laughter)

25:51.300 --> 25:54.762
Now, Christ and Moses

25:54.804 --> 25:56.764
both possessed humility.

25:56.806 --> 25:59.684
Why? Wisdom. That's it.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.186
Anybody who is secure,
there's never any hostility

26:02.228 --> 26:03.813
'cause he's cool.

26:03.854 --> 26:07.066
So they just stand there,
in the back of St. Patrick's,

26:07.108 --> 26:10.278
and they'd listen, look around.

26:10.319 --> 26:13.739
Cardinal Spellman would be
relating love and giving

26:13.781 --> 26:15.574
and forgiveness to the people.

26:15.616 --> 26:20.371
-And Christ would be confused...
-(soft laughter)

26:20.413 --> 26:24.041
...because their route took them
through Spanish Harlem

26:24.083 --> 26:27.420
and he would wonder
what 40 Puerto Ricans were doing

26:27.461 --> 26:29.880
living in one room
and this guy had a ring on

26:29.922 --> 26:31.090
that was worth eight grand.

26:31.132 --> 26:33.092
(laughter)

26:33.134 --> 26:36.012
And he'd wonder at the grandeur.

26:36.053 --> 26:39.724
"So why aren't the Puerto Ricans
living here?

26:39.765 --> 26:42.893
It's clean and nice
and what does it all mean?"

26:42.935 --> 26:46.480
And maybe Bishop Sheen would
see them in the back there,

26:46.522 --> 26:49.317
and he would run up to Spellman
on the lectern.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.569
"Psst, I want to talk to you
a minute."

26:51.610 --> 26:52.987
"What is it?"

26:53.029 --> 26:55.114
"What is it? Oh, you're never
gonna guess who's here."

26:55.156 --> 26:56.615
"Who's here?"

26:56.657 --> 26:58.451
"You're not gonna believe me,
you're gonna think

26:58.492 --> 26:59.660
I've been drinking."

26:59.702 --> 27:00.661
"All right, who's here?"

27:00.703 --> 27:01.912
(exhales)

27:01.954 --> 27:03.998
"Christ and Moses."

27:04.040 --> 27:06.208
"Are you putting me on, now?"

27:06.250 --> 27:07.418
"I'm telling you they're here."

27:07.460 --> 27:09.045
"Are you sure it's them?"

27:09.086 --> 27:10.504
"Well, I've only seen them
in pictures,

27:10.546 --> 27:12.089
"but I'm pretty sure it's them.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.800
"Moses is a ringer
for Charlton Heston, and, uh,

27:14.842 --> 27:15.968
I'm sure."

27:16.010 --> 27:17.011
"Where are they standing?"

27:17.053 --> 27:18.220
"In the back.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.139
Don't look now, you idiot.
They can see us."

27:20.181 --> 27:23.309
"All right, give me a direct
line to Rome, quickly.

27:23.351 --> 27:27.730
"Hello? John,
it's Fran in New York.

27:27.772 --> 27:30.441
"Yes, uh, listen. A couple
of kids dropped in, and, uh,

27:30.483 --> 27:32.068

27:32.109 --> 27:35.154

27:43.454 --> 27:46.499

-So?
-So what?

28:13.192 --> 28:15.152
You just saw Lenny Bruce.
What did you think?

28:15.194 --> 28:16.862
Funny. And he didn't spit once.

28:16.904 --> 28:19.698
He's brilliant. He gets arrested
for the things he says.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.617
Can you imagine?
Arresting a comedian.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.202
Anyone who makes people
think for themselves

28:23.244 --> 28:24.620
is very dangerous.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.330
-Deep.
-I am very deep.

28:26.372 --> 28:29.542
And on call. I have to check in
with the hospital.

-You'll excuse me a minute?
-Yep.

29:18.048 --> 29:19.467
I've been doing some gigs
here and there.

29:19.508 --> 29:20.926
Right now I'm up
in the Catskills.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.472
You know, what, uh,
resorts are you playing?

29:24.513 --> 29:26.891
Steiner, but I'm not working
there, I'm with my family.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.726
-Voluntarily?
-Yep. They go every year.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.728
Well, that sounds terrible.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.731
Yeah-- I'm noticing
more than one glass here.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.859
-I'm with someone.
-A date?

29:36.901 --> 29:38.861
Possibly. Jury's still out.

29:38.903 --> 29:40.279
What, where is he, this date?

29:40.321 --> 29:42.281
He had to check in.
He's on call.

29:42.323 --> 29:43.908
You're kidding.
You went to the Catskills

29:43.949 --> 29:45.326
and you bagged yourself
a doctor?

29:45.367 --> 29:47.286
Your parents must be kvelling.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.622
I haven't bagged him. One date.

29:49.663 --> 29:52.041
Does he know?

29:52.082 --> 29:53.209
Know what?

29:53.250 --> 29:54.752
That you've been corrupted.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.880
Lured to the dark side
of the microphone.

29:57.922 --> 29:59.423
One date.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.466
Do you really think
you can go back

30:00.508 --> 30:02.092
to making Jell-O molds again?

30:02.134 --> 30:03.886
Uh, I don't know.
I make a hell of a Jell-O mold.

30:03.928 --> 30:07.097
I bet you do. Oh, well,
I bet he's a very nice man

30:07.139 --> 30:09.725

in the barrels like clockwork.

-Everyone who owes me money,
yes.

Hello. I enjoyed your act.

30:17.691 --> 30:21.028
Ah. That was no act.

30:22.279 --> 30:25.824
All right. I have to be going.

30:25.866 --> 30:27.326
It was nice
to meet you, Benjamin.

30:27.368 --> 30:29.703
Uh, this table is on me.

30:29.745 --> 30:32.706

-Good girl.

31:04.113 --> 31:05.906

31:05.948 --> 31:09.285
-Five bucks.
-Told you: never bet me.
I never lose.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.870
Yeah, yeah.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.455
Danny Kaye is Jewish.

31:13.497 --> 31:16.625
Does your family own
this restaurant, or something?

31:16.667 --> 31:19.128
-No. Why?
-You just seem
to know everyone here.

31:19.169 --> 31:22.423
What? No. Uh, some quick menu
tips: great sandwiches,

31:22.464 --> 31:25.050
good soups, stay away
from the Italian specialties,

31:25.092 --> 31:26.844
unless you like
mediocre Greek food.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.847
Got it.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.433
-So Lenny Bruce...
-We did not.

31:32.474 --> 31:34.101
Had to ask.
I think I'll get the brisket.

31:34.143 --> 31:35.728
SOLLY: Midge.
Mid-September, two spots.

31:35.769 --> 31:38.105
-I'll call Susie.
-Thanks, Solly.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.983
My hairdresser.

31:41.025 --> 31:46.030
So I'm thinking, if this night
continues to go in the direction

31:46.071 --> 31:48.449
it's currently headed,
we should have dinner next week.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.951
Cloth napkins, bathroom
attendants. What do you say?

31:50.993 --> 31:52.328
I'd even spring to go back
and see the second act

31:52.369 --> 31:53.829
of Lizzie Borden if you want.

31:53.871 --> 31:55.456
Maybe it wasn't a trial.
Maybe it was a musical,

31:55.497 --> 31:57.333
-or a puppet show.
-I'm a comedian.

31:57.374 --> 31:59.501
-You're a...
-I'm a standup. I do comedy.

31:59.543 --> 32:01.712
I go to clubs at night
and tell jokes.

32:01.754 --> 32:03.714
-Like Lenny Bruce.
-Like Lenny Bruce.

32:03.756 --> 32:05.799
Well, not as good
as Lenny Bruce-- yet.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.052
-So you don't work at B. Altman?
-No, I work at B. Altman.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.095
I don't make any money
from comedy, yet.

32:10.137 --> 32:12.056
So B. Altman's my day job.
And it's a secret.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.141
-B. Altman's a secret?
-Comedy is a secret.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.851
-Okay.
-No one knows.

32:15.893 --> 32:17.936
Except Solly. He's a booker.

32:17.978 --> 32:19.730
And Verla. She knows.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.148
Benny, Jo-Jo, they know.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.650
Basically, that whole side
of the place.

32:22.691 --> 32:25.361
They know. And Joel, my ex.

32:25.402 --> 32:28.072
He knows. He actually saw me
perform one night.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.698
That's why we're not
together anymore.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.700
But no one else. Well, Susie.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.535
She's the one you see walking
around Steiner with the plunger.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.162
She's my manager.

32:35.204 --> 32:36.955
Your manager is walking around
Steiner with a plunger?

32:36.997 --> 32:38.374
I don't know a lot
about show business,

32:38.415 --> 32:39.917
but perhaps you need
a different manager.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.669
No. She's great. We're partners.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.587
And-- Lenny. He knows.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.339
So it's not a terribly
well-kept secret.

32:45.381 --> 32:48.175
I'm going to tell
my family soon, after vacation.

32:48.217 --> 32:49.802
But I haven't yet.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.512
So that thing you did
in the car, the radio thing?

32:51.553 --> 32:52.888
That was one of your bits?

32:52.930 --> 32:55.808
-No. I was just riffing.
-Huh.

32:55.849 --> 32:57.518
I just thought

32:57.559 --> 33:01.897
if we are going to do
whatever we're going to do,

33:01.939 --> 33:05.442
then you should know
I am a comic.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.278
A comic.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.114
Mm-hmm.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.825
(radio playing faintly)

33:12.866 --> 33:14.868
Weird.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.374
So how's the meatloaf?

33:20.416 --> 33:21.917
-Do you like meatloaf?
-I do.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.961
Then keep on looking.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.676
(phone ringing)

33:35.472 --> 33:37.057
Hello?

33:37.099 --> 33:38.308
What the fuck
are you doing in New York

33:38.350 --> 33:39.518
and I'm in the Catskills?

33:39.560 --> 33:41.270
-Oh. I had to come back.
-And you didn't tell me?

33:41.311 --> 33:43.230
-Wha-- I'm sorry.
-I came up here because of you.

33:43.272 --> 33:44.773
-I know.
-I looked all over
this nightmare place

33:44.815 --> 33:46.066
trying to find you.

33:46.108 --> 33:47.568
I went to bingo and bunny hop

33:47.609 --> 33:49.319
and color your face. Nowhere.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.946
-Susie...
-I went to the beauty parlor,

33:50.988 --> 33:52.489
and the indoor skating rink--
a skating rink,

33:52.531 --> 33:53.991
in the middle of summer.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.701
What group of total
and complete assholes

33:55.743 --> 33:57.786
needs a skating rink
in the middle of summer?

33:57.828 --> 33:58.912
How the fuck
did these people make it

33:58.954 --> 34:00.122
out of the desert to begin with?

34:00.164 --> 34:01.790
I went everywhere.
I was in such a frenzy,

34:01.832 --> 34:03.584
I lost my plunger.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.502
I just left it somewhere, and
then I had to go hunting for it,

34:05.544 --> 34:07.546
which meant I had to go back
to the skating rink

34:07.588 --> 34:09.381
and then back to bingo bullshit

34:09.423 --> 34:11.258
and then back to pogo pony
up your ass.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.051
I don't think these are all
Steiner-sanctioned activities.

34:13.093 --> 34:14.970
I've been paging you nonstop
to the point where they finally

34:15.012 --> 34:17.431
figured out something was up and
put a lock on the microphone.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.057
And then, as I was crouching
in the bushes outside

34:19.099 --> 34:21.310
your family's house,
I thought, "Wait a minute,

34:21.351 --> 34:24.271
what's a real shit move someone
like Miriam Maisel could pull?"

34:24.313 --> 34:25.898
She could up and desert me here

34:25.939 --> 34:27.065
and go back to the city
she never should've left

34:27.107 --> 34:28.650
-in the first place.
-I'm...

34:28.692 --> 34:30.319
So I called B. Asshole, where
you work, and tried to get

34:30.360 --> 34:32.321
some info out of the brain trust
at the switchboard,

34:32.362 --> 34:34.072
but there was so much buzzing
in their heads.

34:34.114 --> 34:37.367
So then, as a Hail fucking Mary,
I call your house, and what ho!

34:37.409 --> 34:39.328
-I am sorry.
-What fucking ho?

34:39.369 --> 34:40.579
I got a chance to get back up
to the makeup floor.

34:40.621 --> 34:41.914
I had to get back right away.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.290
Are you done playing
with lipstick?

34:43.332 --> 34:44.625
'Cause I got you a gig.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.251
What? Where?

34:46.293 --> 34:48.337
The Concord. Late show. Tonight.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.255
Tonight? That's short notice.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.256
Well, it wouldn't
have been short

34:51.298 --> 34:52.466
if you'd been fucking up here.

34:52.508 --> 34:53.842
Well, I-I was gonna come back
here after work,

34:53.884 --> 34:55.093
but I guess maybe
I could take a bus to...

34:55.135 --> 34:57.346
I don't care
about your goddamn schedule,

34:57.387 --> 34:58.680
just get your ass back here.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.265
-Okay. I'll be there.
-Be there.

35:00.307 --> 35:02.226
-I just said I'll be there.
-Because if you're not there,

35:02.267 --> 35:04.061
in my travels today,
I found a lot of places

35:04.102 --> 35:06.522
I could hide your body with
minimal digging. Understand?

35:06.563 --> 35:09.191
-It's exciting, about the gig.
-Fuck you.

MIDGE: It's very nice of you
to do this, Noah.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.217
-I owe you.
-Yes, I'll put in on your tab.

35:35.259 --> 35:38.011
I just couldn't believe it, when
the phone rang and it was you.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.055
I mean, normally, when the phone
rings, it's a salesman

35:40.097 --> 35:42.641
trying to sell me a vegetable
brush or my doctor saying, like,

35:42.683 --> 35:46.061
"Nope, try again," but today,
it was you wanting a ride!

35:46.103 --> 35:47.396
Such a brucha.

35:47.437 --> 35:49.231
You are saving my life.

35:49.273 --> 35:51.316
That's quite a getup
you're wearing for a car ride.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.318
Going somewhere special tonight?

35:53.360 --> 35:54.695
Me? Nope.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.572
You do look very fancy.

35:56.613 --> 35:58.824
Is there a shayna punim
in the picture?

35:58.866 --> 36:00.033
Oh, no. Nothing like that...

36:00.075 --> 36:01.201
-Oh.
-...I don't think.

36:01.243 --> 36:02.953
Hey, Dad called me last night.

36:02.995 --> 36:05.122
He said he wants to talk to me
about something important.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.333
-Any idea what that may be?
-You think he'd tell me?

36:08.375 --> 36:10.294
I'm sorry, are we just gonna
ignore the smell in the car?

36:10.335 --> 36:12.129
-Yes, we are.
-Noah.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.090
Well, you smell it, right?
It's a very strong smell.

36:15.132 --> 36:18.635
It's like a skunk or mold
or rotting fruit or...

36:18.677 --> 36:21.430
-Me. It's me.
-No, Astrid, it's not...

36:21.471 --> 36:24.808
-Oh, my God, it is you.
-Here you go.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.852
ASTRID: So I went to Chinatown
and I bought this herbal paste

36:26.894 --> 36:28.896
that you're supposed
to put on during certain times

36:28.937 --> 36:30.814
when certain things are
happening or supposed to be

36:30.856 --> 36:33.358
happening or are probably
happening to most people anyway,

36:33.400 --> 36:35.193
but theoretically,
when things could be happening,

36:35.235 --> 36:38.405
just to someone else
but never to me, you put it on.

36:38.447 --> 36:40.282
Ugh, it's so strong.

36:40.324 --> 36:43.410
It's like a mixture of ammonia
and Esther's diaper.

36:43.452 --> 36:45.370
So you put the paste on, which
I did, and then a month later,

36:45.412 --> 36:47.289
you're supposed to get pregnant.

36:47.331 --> 36:48.999
They didn't tell me about
the smell. (laughs)

36:49.041 --> 36:51.168
I don't think-- they might have.
They're Chinese.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.087
But it has a smell, and it tends
to harden as it dries,

36:54.129 --> 36:56.006
which is why
I'm walking so funny.

36:56.048 --> 36:59.009
You know, let's just go back
to ignoring it, shall we?

36:59.051 --> 37:00.427
That's what I've been
doing for a month.

37:00.469 --> 37:02.721
Oh, hey, Noah, you can
drop me off at the Concord.

37:02.763 --> 37:04.431
-Why?
-Oh, is it because of me?

37:04.473 --> 37:05.724
No, you shouldn't have to walk.
I'll walk.

37:05.766 --> 37:07.184
Hey, drop me off at the Concord.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.560
No, it's because of you, Astrid.

37:08.602 --> 37:10.395
I just want to go
to the Concord.

37:10.437 --> 37:11.813
I'm meeting friends there.

37:11.855 --> 37:14.191
-What friends?
-Concord friends.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.318
Now I understand the dress.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.111
-Stop it.
-Wait, what do you mean?

37:18.153 --> 37:19.196
Midge has a man.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.198
ASTRID:
Oh, a man! (laughs)

37:21.239 --> 37:23.700
A little shayna punim
at the Concord.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.327
Oh, I'm so happy
I could hug you.

37:25.369 --> 37:28.872
-Astrid.
-I won't. I promise.

37:28.914 --> 37:32.501
Shayna punim.

37:32.542 --> 37:35.504
♪ To tell you
what you mean to me... ♪

37:35.545 --> 37:37.506
SUSIE:
Ugh, thank God you made it.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.925
I made it. It's a miracle,
but I made it.

37:39.967 --> 37:41.551
Boy, this is classy.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.720
Yeah, you think I'd drag you
back here to work a sewer?

37:43.762 --> 37:45.681
-I do.
-I would, but I didn't have to.

37:45.722 --> 37:47.099
Hey, what's with this?
We're not at Steiner.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.934
Why are you still
carrying that around?

37:48.976 --> 37:50.811
After what happened before,
I'm not leaving her alone again.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.730
-Her?
-Just focus on your set, please.

37:53.772 --> 37:57.317
Okay, I'm sorry. Wow, big room.

37:57.359 --> 37:58.777
Did you tell me how big
this room is?

37:58.819 --> 38:02.114
It's really big.
Huge, it's like...

38:02.155 --> 38:03.699
What are you doing?
Are you counting?

38:03.740 --> 38:05.534
I just want to know how much
bigger this room is

38:05.575 --> 38:07.661
than any other room I've ever
played in my entire life.

38:07.703 --> 38:09.246
Who gives a shit
if it's a bigger room?

38:09.287 --> 38:11.248
It's still just a room.
It's the same audience.

38:11.289 --> 38:14.376
There will be dumb people
and drunk people and loud people

38:14.418 --> 38:15.836
and people throwing up
in the corner.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.212
Just... more than
you're used to.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.006
Who the hell is this?

38:19.047 --> 38:22.134
Ah. Great. Melvin, I'd like
you to meet Midge Maisel.

38:22.175 --> 38:23.343
Mrs. Maisel.

38:23.385 --> 38:24.928
This isn't the girl I hired.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.472
-It isn't?
-Yes, it is.
-No. No, no, no.

38:27.514 --> 38:28.890
(stammers)
She doesn't look anything

38:28.932 --> 38:30.308
like the picture you showed me.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.935
The picture you showed me
looked funny.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.437
She doesn't look funny.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.063
W-What is she, a-a singer?

38:35.105 --> 38:36.857
No. She's not a singer,
she's a comic.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.650
No.

38:38.692 --> 38:40.902
Look, she just doesn't
have her makeup on yet. Okay?

38:40.944 --> 38:42.529
By the way,
it's a little creepy,

38:42.571 --> 38:44.573
you carrying her picture around
in your pants like that.

38:44.614 --> 38:46.575
Makeup? How much makeup?
How much makeup does she wear?

38:46.616 --> 38:48.118
Who are you, Max Factor?

38:48.160 --> 38:49.619
-I need a comic.
-And you got one.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.830
-A funny comic.
-Will you relax?

38:51.872 --> 38:53.582
You worry like that, you'll take
ten years off your life.

38:53.623 --> 38:55.000
And from the looks of you,

38:55.042 --> 38:58.336
you only have about
five left to begin with.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.338
Dressing room's in the back.

39:00.380 --> 39:03.300
Get your makeup on.
She better look funny!

39:03.341 --> 39:05.302
Susie, what is he talking about?

39:05.343 --> 39:07.971
-Nothing.
-What picture did you...

39:08.013 --> 39:10.974
-That's Mamie Eisenhower.
-Yeah, so?

39:11.016 --> 39:13.310
You told him
I look like Mamie Eisenhower?

39:13.351 --> 39:14.728
Look, I said what I need
to get you the gig,

39:14.770 --> 39:15.812
and I got you the gig.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.147
We're just lucky that moron

39:17.189 --> 39:18.732
doesn't read
a fucking newspaper.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.567
Susie, he thinks
I'm gonna go out on the stage

39:20.609 --> 39:22.486
looking like the president's
wife, and when I don't,

39:22.527 --> 39:25.572
he's gonna pull me off the stage
in front of 400,000 people.

39:25.614 --> 39:27.157
Relax about the goddamn room.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.159
It's not 400,000 people, okay?

39:29.201 --> 39:31.995
It's not even-- Oh, I didn't see
those seats back there.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.330
Okay, it's big.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.165
But you're gonna do great.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.501
-Now, let's go find you a drink.
-I don't need a drink.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.836
Eh, place this big,
you're gonna need a drink.

39:39.878 --> 39:43.799
Oh, Jesus Christ,
look at the size of that bar.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.384
(birds calling)

39:46.426 --> 39:47.385
(singsongy):
Make sure you have everything.

39:47.427 --> 39:48.887
I have everything.

39:48.929 --> 39:51.056
-Where's your hat?
-I forgot my hat.

39:51.098 --> 39:53.809
I hope they have that
fire juggler again this year.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.727
You wonder what happens
in a person's life

39:55.769 --> 39:58.230
that makes them stumble
across a talent like that.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.815
It's on the chair.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.399
I think, next year,
it's going to be time

40:01.441 --> 40:03.360
for a new grass skirt.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.903
-You ready?
-MOISHE: Remember, Mendelsons,

40:04.945 --> 40:07.489
tonight, everyone gets lei'd!

40:07.531 --> 40:09.324
(man chuckles)

40:09.366 --> 40:11.326
-Rose, I can't do it.
-Every year, you say that.

40:11.368 --> 40:13.411
Then you put it on, and
you never want to take it off.

40:13.453 --> 40:17.165
I can't spend Polynesian Night
at the same table with that man.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.584
-Oh, Abe.
-You know how many times

40:19.626 --> 40:22.003
he's going to say the words
"pupu platter."

40:22.045 --> 40:25.340
I can't listen
to his litany of "lei'd" jokes.

40:25.382 --> 40:28.593
I-I can't watch him
tip the waiters in coconuts.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.346
I can't take him substituting
the word "poi" for "goy"

40:31.388 --> 40:34.099
-in casual conversation.
-All right, I'll tell you what.

40:34.141 --> 40:36.852
I'll represent us at dinner,
and you stay here and relax.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.854
-Really?
-You've earned a break.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.689
I'll bring you back
a pineapple boat.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.524
And, remember,
Moishe and Shirley

40:42.566 --> 40:44.860
are seeing Duke Ellington
at Grossinger's Tuesday,

40:44.901 --> 40:46.695
so they won't be here
for Schnitzel Night.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.864
-They won't ruin the schnitzel?
-They will not ruin

40:48.905 --> 40:51.283
-the schnitzel.
-You're a very good wife.

talking to me?

41:30.030 --> 41:31.406
You're a nice girl.

41:31.448 --> 41:32.991
Or is there something
I don't know?

41:33.033 --> 41:35.827
-I'm being serious.
-Ma.

41:35.869 --> 41:37.329
You're my son.

41:37.370 --> 41:39.831
-I want you to be happy.
-I know.

41:39.873 --> 41:42.500
And just because you're not
with Midge anymore

41:42.542 --> 41:44.961
doesn't mean you can't be happy.

41:47.964 --> 41:51.760
I just don't want you waiting
around for her, Joel.

41:51.801 --> 41:56.431
Because I don't think
she's waiting around for you.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.481
You look nice in your coat, Ma.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.899
But do I look rich?

42:05.941 --> 42:07.567
-Like a Rockefeller.
-(chuckles)

42:07.609 --> 42:09.236
MOISHE:
Look who I found wandering

42:09.277 --> 42:10.820
around the island alone.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.657
-SHIRLEY: Oh, hello, Rose.
-Hello, Shirley.

42:13.698 --> 42:16.076
Shirley, you notice something
different about Rose tonight?

42:16.117 --> 42:18.745
A certain glow? I think
she may have gotten lei'd.

42:18.787 --> 42:20.747
-(laughs) Oh, Moishe.
-(chuckles) Mm.

42:20.789 --> 42:22.415
You are something else.

42:22.457 --> 42:24.334
May I escort you ladies
to the table?

42:24.376 --> 42:26.670
I hear the chef made
a whole lot of pupu.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.421
-(laughs)
-So, Shirley tells me

42:28.463 --> 42:30.173
you're gonna be buried
in Israel.

42:30.215 --> 42:31.841
Any idea when?

42:31.883 --> 42:33.176
(Moishe speaks indistinctly)

42:33.218 --> 42:34.678
♪ Fish and poi ♪

42:34.719 --> 42:37.347
♪ No care tomorrow. ♪

42:37.389 --> 42:39.599
♪ ♪

42:39.641 --> 42:41.643
-(indistinct chatter)
-(insects trilling)

42:44.562 --> 42:47.148
(door creaks open)

42:47.190 --> 42:50.110
(door shuts)

42:52.112 --> 42:53.738
Dinner's the other way, Abe.

42:53.780 --> 42:56.241
Oh. Joel, hello.

42:56.283 --> 42:59.494
Yes, I'm actually going
to skip dinner tonight.

42:59.536 --> 43:00.996
I had a very big lunch

43:01.037 --> 43:03.415
and double my allotment
of tomato juice,

43:03.456 --> 43:05.917
so I thought I'd just...

43:05.959 --> 43:08.545
walk it off for two
or three more hours.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.088
Needed a break
from my parents, huh?

43:10.130 --> 43:11.089
-Yes.
-I understand.

43:11.131 --> 43:12.590
I'm sure you do.

43:12.632 --> 43:14.801
-Well...
-Hey,

43:14.843 --> 43:16.261
is Midge back yet?

43:16.303 --> 43:18.680
Uh, no, she's still in New York.

43:18.722 --> 43:19.889
Anything wrong?

43:19.931 --> 43:21.683
Nope. Just wondering.

43:21.725 --> 43:23.476
I'll tell her
you're looking for her.

43:23.518 --> 43:25.562
-Yep. Good.
-Oh, and, um,

43:25.603 --> 43:28.315
-if your parents ask...
-I never saw you.

43:37.657 --> 43:39.117
Now, this is a much bigger room
than you're used to,

43:39.159 --> 43:40.535
so it's gonna feel
completely different.

43:40.577 --> 43:42.537
-Wait, what?
-And it'll take longer

43:42.579 --> 43:44.289
for the laughs to reach you,
and they'll be

43:44.331 --> 43:46.291
proportionally quieter
because of the tall ceilings.

43:46.333 --> 43:48.043
I thought you said this place
wasn't that much bigger.

43:48.084 --> 43:50.003
I also said you looked
like Mamie Eisenhower.

43:50.045 --> 43:53.256
-This place is huge. Keep up.
-That's her with her makeup on?

43:53.298 --> 43:55.925
-Yeah.
-She looks even less funny now!

43:55.967 --> 43:57.093
You know what,
she's just gonna be funny

43:57.135 --> 43:58.345
instead of look funny, okay?

43:58.386 --> 44:01.097
She's not funny, I'm not paying.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.849
-So no pressure.
-Nope.

44:02.891 --> 44:04.517
-Okay, where were we?
-Laughs will take forever

44:04.559 --> 44:06.019
-to reach me.
-Yes, they will.

44:06.061 --> 44:07.687
So it might be tough
to gauge how it's going.

44:07.729 --> 44:09.272
Hold a little longer
for the laughs

44:09.314 --> 44:10.940
and look down at who you can see
in the audience.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.776
If they're smilin',
you're doing good.

44:12.817 --> 44:15.195
I wonder what Mamie Eisenhower
would do in this situation.

44:15.236 --> 44:17.822
Big room is just more people
to fall in love with you.

44:17.864 --> 44:19.908
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

44:19.949 --> 44:22.744
the Concord Hotel
is pleased to welcome

44:22.786 --> 44:25.413
-to the stage Mrs. Maisel!
-Okay. Here we go.

44:25.455 --> 44:27.582
-Tits up.
-Tits up.

44:27.624 --> 44:29.584
(applause)

44:29.626 --> 44:31.669
(cheering)

44:31.711 --> 44:33.671
Thank you, everybody.

44:33.713 --> 44:36.299
Thank you very much.

44:36.341 --> 44:38.718
Here we are in the Catskills,
and I'm starving.

44:38.760 --> 44:41.137
Where can you get a decent meal
around here?

44:41.179 --> 44:42.847
-(laughter)
-Food.

44:42.889 --> 44:46.476
Food.
24 hours a day, food.

44:46.518 --> 44:48.103
Shouldn't the Catskills season
be in winter,

44:48.144 --> 44:50.522
with big coats and scarves?

44:50.563 --> 44:52.690
What kind of sadists
feed you ten meals a day,

44:52.732 --> 44:54.109
then tell you to put on
a fucking bikini

44:54.150 --> 44:55.193
and go find a husband?

44:55.235 --> 44:57.153
The only reason

44:57.195 --> 44:59.864
we stand a chance is because
the men are too full to run.

44:59.906 --> 45:02.867
And all I see

45:02.909 --> 45:06.329
and hear about
and dream about is food.

45:06.371 --> 45:07.872
Giant portions of food.

45:07.914 --> 45:09.707
I know it's the midnight show.

45:09.749 --> 45:12.043
I'm supposed to be talking
about blow jobs and big tits,

45:12.085 --> 45:14.587
but, after six weeks up here,

45:14.629 --> 45:15.755
tits just start
to look like a couple

45:15.797 --> 45:17.715
of Grossinger's baked Alaskas.

45:17.757 --> 45:19.968
They're, uh--

45:20.009 --> 45:22.262
Oh, you've had them.

45:22.303 --> 45:25.890
But, really, I-I have great
affection for the mountains.

45:25.932 --> 45:28.143
I've been coming up here
with my family since I was born.

45:28.184 --> 45:31.479
It is the best place to have
your first nervous breakdown.

45:31.521 --> 45:33.731
Which automatically comes
with spending months

45:33.773 --> 45:36.234
in a cabin with your family
every year since you were born.

45:36.276 --> 45:39.320
My first everything happened
in the Catskills.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.489
Everything.

45:41.531 --> 45:43.658
My mother first told me
to keep my knees closed

45:43.700 --> 45:45.660
until there's a ring
on my finger in the Catskills.

45:45.702 --> 45:48.496
Actually, she told me
it was biologically impossible

45:48.538 --> 45:50.498
to have sex
without a ring on your finger.

45:50.540 --> 45:52.375
Guess what, Mom,

45:52.417 --> 45:53.793
it's not.

45:53.835 --> 45:56.212
Anyhow, the first boy
I ever kissed

45:56.254 --> 45:58.381
I kissed in the Catskills.

45:58.423 --> 46:01.718
Mm-hmm. First time I ever let
a boy go Christopher Columbus

46:01.759 --> 46:04.679
on my nether regions,
it was in the Catskills.

46:04.721 --> 46:07.682
And this boy, he was my--

46:07.724 --> 46:09.309
Papa.

46:09.350 --> 46:11.728
(audience chuckling)

46:11.769 --> 46:13.771
(quietly):
I...

46:13.813 --> 46:15.940
I...

46:16.983 --> 46:18.693
The Catskills.

46:18.735 --> 46:20.445
Things happen in the Catskills.

46:20.487 --> 46:22.530
All kinds of things happen.

46:22.572 --> 46:24.449
Games. There's games.
You like games? I like games.

46:24.491 --> 46:26.701
And-and when people
come up here with kids,

46:26.743 --> 46:28.369
they want things
for the kids to play

46:28.411 --> 46:31.206
so the adults can go...
be adults.

46:31.247 --> 46:32.624
Parents don't really want
to know what's going on

46:32.665 --> 46:34.292
with their kids
behind their backs.

46:34.334 --> 46:36.211
I mean, they'd prefer
they weren't eaten by a lion

46:36.252 --> 46:38.463
or whatever eats people
in Upstate New York,

46:38.505 --> 46:40.673
but, otherwise, secrets.

46:40.715 --> 46:43.384
Secrets. Kids have secrets.

46:43.426 --> 46:46.804
Mothers and daughters
and daughters and fathers and...

46:46.846 --> 46:49.474
You know, it's weird with
daughters and fathers, isn't it?

46:49.516 --> 46:50.892
Isn't it weird?

46:50.934 --> 46:52.936
I-Is it weird?

46:52.977 --> 46:55.813
Is it?
Fucking make up your mind.

46:55.855 --> 46:58.066
Because fathers never really
know who their daughters are.

46:58.107 --> 46:59.901
They don't want to know,
do they?

46:59.943 --> 47:02.237
It would be terrifying to know
who they are and what they do,

47:02.278 --> 47:03.738
and-and, because they
don't really know any of this,

47:03.780 --> 47:05.406
sometimes they can just walk in
unexpectedly,

47:05.448 --> 47:06.533
and, suddenly, it's like,

47:06.574 --> 47:07.951
"Hey, you're a whore. Who knew?"

47:07.992 --> 47:09.702
Not that I'm a whore.

47:09.744 --> 47:11.621
I am definitely not a whore.

47:11.663 --> 47:13.623
I do not charge for sex.
I mean, that's free.

47:13.665 --> 47:17.585
I mean, it's free to guys
I want it to be free to.

47:17.627 --> 47:19.504
My husband. Boyfriend.

47:19.546 --> 47:21.256
One girl in college.

47:21.297 --> 47:24.300
Anyone with a decent ticket
to a Sinatra concert.

47:24.342 --> 47:26.636
Even my mother would give it up
for a Sinatra ticket.

47:26.678 --> 47:28.596
No, she wouldn't.
My mother wouldn't give it up

47:28.638 --> 47:30.056
for anything, to anyone.

47:30.098 --> 47:31.891
Well, my father.
She'll-she'll give it up to him.

47:31.933 --> 47:34.227
I mean, not that she told me
she'd give it up to him.

47:34.269 --> 47:36.479
But I'm assuming.
Well, I'm here,

47:36.521 --> 47:39.232
so somebody gave up something
to somebody at some point.

47:39.274 --> 47:41.067
Anyhow, e-everyone has sex.

47:41.109 --> 47:42.819
Daughters have sex.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.237
Sons have sex.

47:44.279 --> 47:46.781
Babies come from sex.

47:46.823 --> 47:48.783
Boy, I have got to stop saying
the word "sex."

47:48.825 --> 47:51.286
I actually have never said "sex"
this much before.

47:51.327 --> 47:53.329
I don't think I've ever said
the word "sex" in front

47:53.371 --> 47:55.665
of my father, because my father
looks like what you'd think

47:55.707 --> 47:57.250
a Columbia professor
would look like.

47:57.292 --> 47:59.669
Lots of brown and tweed
and plaid

47:59.711 --> 48:02.005
and a scowl
of intellectual superiority

48:02.046 --> 48:04.257
because he is
intellectually superior.

48:04.299 --> 48:05.883
He is very smart.

48:05.925 --> 48:08.219
My mother once told me
that she pictured having sex

48:08.261 --> 48:09.721
with his mind
on their wedding night

48:09.762 --> 48:11.681
so she didn't have to think
about his penis.

48:11.723 --> 48:13.683
She did not say that.
Some other woman said that.

48:13.725 --> 48:15.518
Just some other person.
And I overheard them

48:15.560 --> 48:18.187
and-- Let's go back to food,
shall we?

48:18.229 --> 48:19.689
Food...

48:19.731 --> 48:21.691
And the donkey
who looked just like my father

48:21.733 --> 48:24.694
stood up and said, "Who else
wants a piece of this?!"

48:24.736 --> 48:28.364
-(laughter)
-I really, really have to go.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.116
But, uh, thank you for laughing.

48:30.158 --> 48:32.785
Please tip a waiter
and enjoy some veal.

48:32.827 --> 48:34.537
I will be here all week
trying to figure out

48:34.579 --> 48:36.289
if I just had some sort
of stroke. I'm Mrs. Maisel.

48:36.331 --> 48:37.457
Thank you! Good night!

48:37.498 --> 48:39.417
(cheering and applause)

48:40.543 --> 48:42.337
Ha! That's the way to do it.

48:42.378 --> 48:44.088
You had them. You own them.

48:44.130 --> 48:46.007
No one in that audience
is ever gonna be the same.

48:46.049 --> 48:47.675
Did you hear that applause?

48:47.717 --> 48:49.344
And that's not because
it's taking so long

48:49.385 --> 48:50.845
to reach here from the back
that it's just arriving.

48:50.887 --> 48:52.096
No, that's because
they like Ike!

48:52.138 --> 48:55.016
-They like Ike!
-All right, you win.

48:55.058 --> 48:57.685
-Uh, one more time?
-She's great. I want her back.

48:57.727 --> 48:59.771
You sure? You want to wait till
she gets a little double chin?

48:59.812 --> 49:01.439
-No.
-I was gonna take her
in the bathroom

49:01.481 --> 49:03.024
and break her nose
to make her a little funnier.

49:03.066 --> 49:04.942
No. No, no, no.
I want her just like that.

49:04.984 --> 49:06.361
Don't change a thing!

49:06.402 --> 49:08.029
I fucking love the Catskills.

49:08.071 --> 49:10.448
Why didn't he leave?
Why didn't he leave?

49:10.490 --> 49:12.784
-Who?
-Man, front row,

49:12.825 --> 49:14.369
60 years old, mustache,

49:14.410 --> 49:15.787
Polynesian clothes.

49:15.828 --> 49:17.205
Doesn't narrow it down.

49:17.246 --> 49:18.956
-My father.
-Your father?

49:18.998 --> 49:20.541
-Your father was out there?
-Yes.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.627
You said all that shit
in front of your father?

49:22.669 --> 49:24.462
Wow, you have got balls.

49:24.504 --> 49:26.422
Is he still there?

49:27.423 --> 49:29.801
Nope. Nowhere to be seen.

49:29.842 --> 49:32.845
MIDGE:
That's because he's here.

49:45.650 --> 49:48.403
I'm taking you home.

50:08.589 --> 50:11.342
Are we in trouble?
