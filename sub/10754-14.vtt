00:16.006 --> 00:18.050
Allow me.

00:18.926 --> 00:21.303
You're welcome.

00:25.266 --> 00:28.102
When did everyone become so boorish?

00:28.268 --> 00:32.856
Sometimes, I think I'm the only
person with any sense of refinement.

00:33.023 --> 00:35.150
Oh, smell my hands.

00:37.027 --> 00:39.071
Thank you, no.

00:39.238 --> 00:43.367
I'm so proud. I had to stop for gas,
and I pumped it myself.

00:45.619 --> 00:48.163
- It's part of a new kick I'm on.
- What?

00:48.330 --> 00:50.833
I'm learning to be handy.

00:50.999 --> 00:54.586
I depend too much on others,
so I'm doing it myself.

00:54.753 --> 00:59.383
Feel that.
Surely the start of a first-rate callus.

00:59.549 --> 01:02.761
- You left this in your booth.
- Thank you.

01:02.928 --> 01:06.014
- What is it?
- A tape I rented for Dad.

01:06.181 --> 01:08.225
It's our new Wednesday ritual.

01:08.392 --> 01:14.022
Dad makes chilli, we watch an Angie
Dickinson movie and I wish I was dead.

01:15.524 --> 01:19.611
- You should join us.
- No, I got my first work shirt today

01:19.778 --> 01:24.032
and tonight, I'm tackling
the squeaky hasp on my cigar humidor.

01:24.199 --> 01:27.160
Be sure to wear your hernia belt.

01:27.327 --> 01:29.579
Roz, will you join us?

01:29.746 --> 01:32.832
No, I'll just go sit over here.

01:32.999 --> 01:35.335
Are you trying to avoid me?

01:35.502 --> 01:39.089
Yes. You took a year to learn my name.

01:39.256 --> 01:43.134
- You always make snide remarks.
- Name one.

01:43.301 --> 01:48.223
You told me my bedroom was easier
to get into than a community college.

01:50.266 --> 01:52.811
I was hoping you'd name that one.

01:52.977 --> 01:55.021
I've got half a mind to...

01:55.188 --> 01:58.817
Just hold on!
You got off on the wrong foot.

01:59.025 --> 02:03.446
lf you two had a real conversation,
you'd hit it off famously.

02:03.613 --> 02:07.033
You sit and I will go
and get your coffee.

02:10.453 --> 02:13.915
So, how are you?

02:14.082 --> 02:16.376
- Fine. You?
- Great.

02:17.543 --> 02:19.629
I'm handy now.

02:25.551 --> 02:28.137
So...that's a nice jacket.

02:28.304 --> 02:31.516
- Thank you.
- It's offbeat.

02:32.392 --> 02:34.936
What does that mean? "Offbeat"?

02:35.103 --> 02:39.774
- Well...
- I know. Offbeat as in cheap.

02:39.941 --> 02:43.736
I'm not rich enough to shop at
the International House of Tight Ass

02:43.903 --> 02:45.905
like you and Maris the Heiress.

02:47.323 --> 02:51.911
- That is what you meant, right?
- Yes, but I didn't think you'd get it.

02:53.287 --> 02:57.875
- Then you were insulting me.
- You got in some good shots, too.

02:58.042 --> 03:01.003
I did, didn't I?

03:01.170 --> 03:03.964
I'm so glad we did this!

03:05.049 --> 03:08.260
Sometimes I'm such a good therapist,
I scare myself.

03:12.014 --> 03:15.476
- Where's my briefcase?
- Isn't it under your chair?

03:15.643 --> 03:18.229
Someone must have taken it!

03:18.395 --> 03:20.773
Frasier, look, there it is!

03:24.360 --> 03:26.278
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

03:26.445 --> 03:29.031
- Is that your briefcase?
- Yes.

03:29.198 --> 03:33.911
- Where did you get it?
- Some nuns in my parish gave it to me.

03:35.371 --> 03:37.998
Then that would make you a priest.

03:38.165 --> 03:39.833
Yes.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.547
Then, Father, perhaps you'd like to
explain why you'd be carrying around...

03:45.714 --> 03:48.342
...a Bible and some rosary beads!

03:50.385 --> 03:53.263
- What are you looking for?
- A movie.

03:53.430 --> 03:56.391
I loaned it to the monsignor
to give to you.

03:56.558 --> 04:01.021
Apparently he forgot.
It's a two-day rental. It doesn't matter.

04:01.897 --> 04:06.193
Sorry. It looked like yours.
They have the same inferior leather.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.571
- I gave him that briefcase.
- I know.

04:14.660 --> 04:18.497
Yes, I would mind holding.
I've already held three times.

04:18.663 --> 04:22.876
I'm trying to report stolen credit cards
but every five seconds...

04:23.043 --> 04:25.045
Damn it!

04:27.464 --> 04:29.966
Don't stare at me. I'm a humane man,

04:30.133 --> 04:34.387
but right now, I could kick a kitten
through an electric fan.

04:36.848 --> 04:41.811
Hey, Frase. Niles called.
Somebody stole your briefcase?

04:41.978 --> 04:46.066
Go ahead, tell me how stupid I was
to get taken advantage of.

04:46.232 --> 04:51.404
Better than listening to "Jumping
Jack Flash" for piano and flute.

04:51.571 --> 04:57.202
You weren't stupid. These guys are
pros. They need a second, and bam!

04:57.369 --> 05:00.121
That's rather refreshing.

05:00.288 --> 05:03.249
I thought you'd call me
a naive dupe or...

05:03.416 --> 05:06.127
- A bone-headed rube?
- But you're not.

05:06.294 --> 05:10.965
No. You learned a lesson.
You gotta keep your guard up.

05:11.132 --> 05:18.264
This world would be a happier place if
everybody remembered people stink.

05:18.431 --> 05:25.396
That's a little cynical for me. I prefer
to think of people as basically good.

05:25.563 --> 05:31.069
Yes, I am here, but I'm in the middle
of a speech so you'll have to hold!

05:34.614 --> 05:37.700
I enjoy my life that way.

05:37.867 --> 05:42.246
lf the price I have to pay is to replace
a few credit cards, so be it.

05:42.413 --> 05:47.460
Reminds me of when I moved to
London. I didn't trust people back then.

05:47.627 --> 05:53.257
I tried to stay out of harm's way
by walking with my eyes cast down,

05:53.424 --> 05:55.718
never meeting anyone's glance.

05:55.885 --> 05:59.597
But I decided that was no way to live.

05:59.764 --> 06:03.851
So one day,
I lifted up my chin and took it all in.

06:04.018 --> 06:07.229
The change was amazing.

06:07.396 --> 06:11.692
There were sights I'd never seen,
sounds I'd never heard.

06:11.859 --> 06:16.405
A tiny old man came up to me with
a note in his hand. He needed help.

06:16.572 --> 06:22.786
This was no city full of thieves
and muggers. People needed me.

06:22.953 --> 06:29.668
I took his note, read it, and I still
remember what I said to him:

06:29.835 --> 06:33.380
"That's not how you spell fellatio."

06:41.472 --> 06:44.808
So, whose point did she prove?

06:44.975 --> 06:47.644
I have no idea.

06:50.397 --> 06:55.360
It's been fun chatting with you all,
nasty old Gertrude aside.

06:56.361 --> 06:59.406
I'd like to close
with a personal message.

06:59.573 --> 07:03.535
This goes out to the person
who stole my briefcase yesterday.

07:04.453 --> 07:09.333
And also stole my dry cleaning
with the claim ticket that was inside it.

07:11.627 --> 07:14.588
You need help,
and I am here to provide it.

07:14.755 --> 07:20.218
Also, the double-breasted navy blue
suit should be worn with French cuffs.

07:20.385 --> 07:24.431
You may be sick,
but you should be stylish.

07:25.599 --> 07:28.185
Until tomorrow, this is Dr Frasier Crane.

07:29.561 --> 07:32.189
Man, that was a great show!

07:32.355 --> 07:35.817
It was better than great!
It was brilliant! You...

07:35.984 --> 07:38.528
What do you want?

07:38.695 --> 07:42.032
- Remember I said I need Friday off?
- No.

07:42.199 --> 07:44.367
You don't remember
or I can't have Friday off?

07:44.534 --> 07:46.578
Take one of each. I'm feeling generous.

07:46.745 --> 07:48.580
(Phone rings)

07:49.456 --> 07:51.916
- Hello.
- (Man) 'Dr Crane?'

07:52.083 --> 07:55.837
- Yes.
- 'Oh, man! I can't believe I got through!'

07:56.004 --> 07:59.257
My show is over.
Please call in again tomorrow.

07:59.424 --> 08:03.428
- 'I'm calling cos I found your briefcase.'
- Are you sure?

08:03.595 --> 08:05.805
- 'Pretty sure.'
- We can check.

08:05.972 --> 08:10.810
In the upper right-hand corner,
there's a water mark

08:10.977 --> 08:15.231
left by the careless resting
of a champagne flute.

08:15.398 --> 08:19.319
- 'It's full of your stuff, Dr Crane.'
- That works as well.

08:20.486 --> 08:25.199
- Is everything still there?
- 'A pen, a set of car keys, a date book.'

08:25.366 --> 08:27.452
- And my wallet?
- 'Sorry.'

08:27.619 --> 08:31.539
That was asking for too much.
How can I get it back?

08:31.706 --> 08:33.750
'I could drop it off.'

08:33.916 --> 08:38.546
Meet me at the Café Nervosa on Pike.
I'd be glad to give you a reward.

08:38.712 --> 08:41.215
'Meeting you is reward enough.
Half an hour?'

08:41.381 --> 08:43.509
That's perfect. Bye.

08:44.719 --> 08:48.181
- That was great.
- But not surprising.

08:48.347 --> 08:53.269
- I told you to have faith in people.
- Yes. People are good. And fair.

08:53.436 --> 08:56.898
We do nice things for people
because of karma.

08:57.064 --> 09:00.276
- You're not getting Friday off.
- Why?

09:05.656 --> 09:07.783
Allow me.

09:11.829 --> 09:15.374
Can you believe that?
That's the second time this week!

09:15.541 --> 09:18.461
- I want to say something.
- Why don't you?

09:19.462 --> 09:24.884
Something happens when I talk to a
beautiful woman. My knees turn to jelly.

09:25.050 --> 09:29.472
You can only break people of
bad habits by confronting them.

09:29.638 --> 09:32.975
- That's true.
- So?

09:33.142 --> 09:35.227
- Who's next here?
- I am.

09:35.394 --> 09:37.980
No, you weren't next. I am!

09:40.608 --> 09:45.613
People like you who glide through life
in a cosy cocoon of narcissism

09:45.779 --> 09:47.823
never notice such things!

09:47.990 --> 09:51.118
But learn this lesson, sister!

09:52.286 --> 09:55.164
There's still such a thing
as good manners.

09:55.330 --> 09:58.709
That's why I insist you let me
buy you your coffee

09:58.876 --> 10:02.171
and please try the poppy seed muffins.

10:02.337 --> 10:04.631
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:12.306 --> 10:15.559
Kind of brutal, weren't you?

10:15.726 --> 10:20.480
I just remember "l was next"
and the sound of blood in my ears.

10:20.647 --> 10:25.527
Soon you'll be home with Maris
and you'll forget about beautiful women.

10:27.446 --> 10:31.408
- Let's sit here so we can see him.
- Your Good Samaritan?

10:31.575 --> 10:35.454
Yes. I'm feeling rather good
about this whole thing.

10:35.620 --> 10:40.083
I lost my wallet and my favourite suit
but other things were intact:

10:40.250 --> 10:43.920
my date book, my spare car keys,
my fountain pen.

10:44.087 --> 10:46.548
But best of all, what remained intact

10:46.715 --> 10:50.218
is my sense that people
are basically trustworthy.

10:50.385 --> 10:56.391
He has your keys. He's meeting you
here knowing you'd bring your car?

10:56.558 --> 11:00.562
Before you launch into a paranoid riff,
my car is...

11:00.729 --> 11:03.690
moving down the street!

11:03.857 --> 11:07.235
Stop that well-dressed man!

11:10.655 --> 11:16.161
Charlie, it's Frasier's car. Could
you put some extra manpower on this?

11:16.327 --> 11:20.081
Yeah. I know. Fell for that old scam.

11:20.832 --> 11:24.919
I told him to keep his guard up,
but Frasier always knows better.

11:25.086 --> 11:27.881
Mr Up-With-People.

11:28.047 --> 11:32.594
Yeah. Remember what we used
to call guys like him on the force?

11:34.846 --> 11:38.391
Hey, we're still talking
about my son here!

11:38.558 --> 11:40.685
Yeah. I'll talk to you.

11:42.020 --> 11:46.899
- Hi, Frasier. How's it going?
- Terribly! Guess what happened today.

11:47.066 --> 11:50.236
- What?
- My car was stolen!

11:51.112 --> 11:53.281
You're kidding.

11:53.448 --> 11:56.784
I fell victim to a master criminal.

11:56.951 --> 12:02.623
Did they hot-wire it? Boy, those guys
got fingers like concert pianists.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.334
No. He had the key.

12:05.501 --> 12:11.257
A real pro. Made a wax impression
and then had a duplicate key made?

12:12.466 --> 12:14.510
No.

12:15.553 --> 12:19.265
It was the same miscreant
that stole my briefcase.

12:19.432 --> 12:21.767
He used the spare set that was inside.

12:21.934 --> 12:26.313
He tailed you so he'd know
where to find the car?

12:28.983 --> 12:31.026
Not exactly.

12:32.445 --> 12:35.531
He called the station
and we agreed to meet.

12:35.698 --> 12:39.618
- What for?
- Low-fat lattes and biscotti.

12:44.707 --> 12:48.002
What are you, the town crier?

12:48.168 --> 12:52.464
It doesn't shake my belief
in the basic goodness of people.

12:52.631 --> 12:57.219
Sure. He's probably using your car
to deliver hot meals to shut-ins.

13:01.432 --> 13:06.854
I'm glad my misfortune's given you so
much glee. Dad, I have two requests.

13:07.020 --> 13:11.525
First, wipe that smirk off your face.
I'm not a child.

13:11.692 --> 13:14.570
What's the second request?

13:15.946 --> 13:19.825
Can I borrow your car?
I want to go to the movies.

13:26.248 --> 13:31.837
And last stop on our tour,
my booth, where all the magic happens.

13:32.004 --> 13:36.883
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Dr Crane needed a lift so I came up.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.886
Just go on about your business.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.597
It's not like I'm listening.

13:43.974 --> 13:47.686
Have we had one visitor yet
who didn't do that?

13:47.853 --> 13:50.814
Thanks but we do have a show to do.

13:50.981 --> 13:55.235
- People say I have a talent for this.
- Yes, of course.

13:55.402 --> 13:59.489
Your soothing voice.
I could listen to you for hours.

13:59.656 --> 14:03.451
- Do you really think so?
- Yes. Absolutely. Now get out.

14:03.618 --> 14:05.328
(Phone rings)

14:05.495 --> 14:10.291
- Could you get that?
- Hello? Who's calling, please?

14:10.458 --> 14:13.002
Just a second.

14:13.169 --> 14:15.839
Denise. She was out with you last night.

14:16.005 --> 14:20.635
- I wasn't out with anyone of that name.
- Ooh, speakerphone!

14:21.719 --> 14:23.680
All right.

14:23.847 --> 14:25.974
Hello. This is Frasier Crane.

14:26.141 --> 14:29.519
(Denise) 'Hey, tiger. I miss you already.'

14:29.686 --> 14:31.855
I beg your pardon?

14:32.021 --> 14:36.609
'You just snuck out this morning
without giving me your number,

14:36.776 --> 14:41.406
'and I woke up to see
your BMW pulling down my driveway.'

14:41.572 --> 14:43.032
You did?

14:43.199 --> 14:48.121
'I'm not mad. How can I be after my best
first night ever with a man? '

14:48.287 --> 14:51.666
Denise, could you hold on
for a moment?

14:52.959 --> 14:56.712
- Do you realise what this means?
- He told her he was you!

14:56.879 --> 14:59.048
And it worked!

14:59.215 --> 15:02.593
Nobody ever sleeps with me
on a first date!

15:04.929 --> 15:06.597
Hi.

15:06.764 --> 15:11.394
'Sorry but I won't be able to meet you
for that drink at Alberto's.

15:11.561 --> 15:15.356
'The agency called.
They booked me for a swimsuit layout.

15:15.523 --> 15:20.069
'There's my cab.
I'll call you tomorrow. Kisses.'

15:20.236 --> 15:22.613
Unbelievable!

15:22.780 --> 15:26.867
He wasn't content to steal my
possessions. He wants my identity!

15:27.034 --> 15:31.205
- I'm calling the police.
- No! I am going to Alberto's!

15:31.372 --> 15:34.291
- You have a show!
- Run "The Best of Dr Crane".

15:34.458 --> 15:37.753
This jackal will meet me, not Denise!

15:37.920 --> 15:43.133
- He could be dangerous!
- I don't care! He's after my soul!

15:43.300 --> 15:48.764
Shakespeare wrote, "He who steals
my purse, steals trash. But he who..."

15:48.931 --> 15:52.601
Oh, I forget the rest,
but it makes me good and mad!

16:04.613 --> 16:09.326
Have you seen a man wearing
an impeccably tailored Italian suit?

16:09.493 --> 16:14.289
- Just you.
- Oh, well. Thank you.

16:14.456 --> 16:18.085
- Giorgio Armani.
- It's nice to meet you, Giorgio.

16:20.671 --> 16:24.299
- My name's Heather.
- Frasier Crane. Do you mind?

16:26.301 --> 16:30.264
Wait a minute.
Dr Frasier Crane, from the radio?

16:30.430 --> 16:33.433
- Yes.
- I've heard your show. You're great.

16:33.600 --> 16:37.229
- Thank you.
- This is exciting!

16:38.689 --> 16:43.860
Didn't you say that someone had
impersonated you at the dry cleaners?

16:44.027 --> 16:48.365
- Yes, someone did.
- You could be the impersonator.

16:48.532 --> 16:51.910
lf you're looking for identification, I...

16:52.994 --> 16:55.747
- I thought so.
- He stole my wallet.

16:55.914 --> 16:59.084
- Who did?
- Frasier did. The bad Frasier!

16:59.251 --> 17:02.003
You're pretty sick, you know that?

17:02.170 --> 17:05.298
This is absurd!
Can't you recognise my...?

17:29.989 --> 17:32.492
Nice suit.

17:32.659 --> 17:36.412
- Oh, my God! It's you!
- No! You're mine now!

17:36.579 --> 17:39.707
All right. I give up.

17:39.874 --> 17:42.001
Damn it! How did you find me?

17:42.168 --> 17:46.547
Denise called
to cancel your rendezvous.

17:46.714 --> 17:50.802
- Great. And I put on my best suit.
- No, you put on my best suit.

17:50.969 --> 17:56.682
Well, I guess this is it.
Party's over. I'm so stupid!

17:56.849 --> 17:59.143
You want to call the police?

17:59.310 --> 18:01.938
No. I'd like to throttle you

18:02.105 --> 18:06.275
till your eyes shoot across the room
like champagne corks!

18:06.818 --> 18:11.823
But this is still a civilised world, though
not for long if you have your way!

18:11.989 --> 18:15.868
Every wallet you steal puts bars
on someone else's windows.

18:16.035 --> 18:19.664
Every purse you snatch
puts mace on another key chain!

18:19.830 --> 18:25.753
You make our lives less liveable and
I hope that burns on your conscience!

18:25.920 --> 18:29.256
What do you have to say for yourself?

18:31.092 --> 18:33.386
You're right.

18:33.552 --> 18:38.015
I see. You think by agreeing with me,
I'll let you off the hook.

18:38.182 --> 18:42.561
No, you're right.
I'm guilty and I deserve what I get.

18:42.728 --> 18:47.316
Your keys. The car's out front
with your briefcase in it.

18:47.483 --> 18:52.112
Call the police. That's your new
car phone, by the way. I upgraded.

18:55.699 --> 18:58.160
I knew things would turn out like this.

18:58.327 --> 19:01.372
Here comes the old sob story.

19:01.538 --> 19:06.752
"My parents didn't love me, the bully
next door stole my baseball glove."

19:06.919 --> 19:12.257
No. Dad loved me. Mom spoiled me
and I was the bully next door.

19:12.424 --> 19:16.470
- Let me do that. It's kind of tricky.
- Thank you.

19:16.637 --> 19:19.515
I myself am to blame for my problems.

19:19.681 --> 19:22.643
Hi. The number
for the Seattle PD, please.

19:22.810 --> 19:26.855
I take the easy way out of everything.
And you know why?

19:27.022 --> 19:31.193
I'm lazy. Lazy, lazy, lazy.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.821
Oh, sweetheart,
could you just connect me?

19:34.988 --> 19:37.074
Thanks, hon.

19:38.450 --> 19:42.496
Your life of crime
is down to your laziness?

19:42.663 --> 19:44.748
I don't like to work.

19:44.915 --> 19:49.086
It's easier to take something
than to work. I'm a lazy criminal.

19:49.252 --> 19:52.964
A briefcase here,
car keys there, light shoplifting.

19:53.131 --> 19:57.552
But a bank robbery? All that planning!
Split-second timing.

19:57.719 --> 20:04.309
Forget it! And that second-storey stuff -
grappling hooks! Who does that?

20:04.476 --> 20:07.812
Yeah. Thank you. You're on hold.

20:07.979 --> 20:10.023
Story of my week.

20:10.982 --> 20:15.570
- You seem to be taking this well.
- It was bound to happen.

20:15.737 --> 20:19.824
Perhaps you wanted to get caught.

20:19.991 --> 20:24.079
Think about it.
You've taken ever-greater risks.

20:24.245 --> 20:26.539
That's a man who wants to get caught.

20:26.706 --> 20:28.875
I'm telling you. Lazy!

20:29.042 --> 20:32.587
Your pants. You'd think
I'd have them hemmed? Staples.

20:32.754 --> 20:34.839
Oh, dear God!

20:36.216 --> 20:40.136
I still say that
you really wanted to get caught.

20:40.303 --> 20:45.225
- It's a classic <i>cri de cœur.</i>
- Cri de what?

20:45.391 --> 20:49.228
It means you don't like the life
that you're living.

20:49.395 --> 20:51.439
It's not a great life.

20:51.606 --> 20:56.611
I don't know where my rent's coming
from, I have no solid relationship.

20:56.778 --> 21:01.074
- Why don't you change?
- Gimme an 'L'. Gimme an 'A'...

21:01.240 --> 21:07.872
As a psychiatrist, I don't buy that.
You're not lazy. You are afraid.

21:08.039 --> 21:11.375
There are lots of things
you could do legitimately.

21:11.542 --> 21:14.587
You're afraid to try one of them
and fail at it.

21:14.754 --> 21:17.673
- You think I can change?
- Yes.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.760
I believe in the basic goodness
of people.

21:20.927 --> 21:24.180
Hello. Yes. Just a moment, please.

21:25.806 --> 21:29.810
Start now.
Take responsibility for yourself.

21:29.977 --> 21:33.230
For once, don't take the easy way out.

21:37.193 --> 21:40.654
Hello? Yeah, I'd like to report a crime.

21:40.821 --> 21:43.991
He's been impersonating
Frasier Crane!

21:44.158 --> 21:47.870
- Let's go.
- What? I am Frasier Crane.

21:48.037 --> 21:52.124
- Do you have any ID?
- No, but it's true. Tell them.

21:52.291 --> 21:55.336
Thank God you're here.
I've detained him.

21:55.503 --> 21:58.923
- What?!
- But he's lying! He's the impostor!

21:59.089 --> 22:03.636
Don't you recognise me?
This is madness!

22:03.802 --> 22:09.808
People of the world, listen to me! Trust
no one, especially that lazy bastard!

22:14.063 --> 22:19.693
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.860 --> 22:21.153
# Oh, my!

22:21.320 --> 22:27.826
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:27.993 --> 22:34.291
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:34.458 --> 22:36.960
# They're calling again #

22:37.127 --> 22:39.838
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
