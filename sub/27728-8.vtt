00:00.328 --> 00:02.286
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:02.311 --> 00:04.139
I'd forgotten about this place.

00:04.164 --> 00:05.554
Our dads' old hunting cabin.

00:07.601 --> 00:08.687
You have a secret.

00:08.758 --> 00:10.132
Don't let it do to you

00:10.209 --> 00:11.258
what it did to your father.

00:11.335 --> 00:13.677
You didn't cover up
my sister's murder

00:13.688 --> 00:15.304
because you killed her.

00:15.381 --> 00:17.189
It was Isobel, wasn't it?

00:17.266 --> 00:18.432
Yes.

00:18.509 --> 00:20.651
I never want to see you again.

00:20.728 --> 00:22.311
You killed

00:22.336 --> 00:23.460
three people.

00:23.485 --> 00:25.377
How can you guarantee
it won't happen again?

00:25.402 --> 00:28.162
I was trying to create a serum
that would mute your powers,

00:28.187 --> 00:30.663
that would do the opposite
of acetone.

00:30.688 --> 00:31.729
Something has to be done.

00:31.931 --> 00:32.855
I mean, Liz is right.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.021
As long as I'm blacking out,

00:34.046 --> 00:35.471
I am dangerous.

00:35.496 --> 00:37.662
And I'm not going
to allow myself

00:37.687 --> 00:40.989
to hurt anyone again.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.351
Safety is so easy
to take for granted.

00:46.245 --> 00:49.963
Especially
when you grow up loved...

00:49.988 --> 00:52.831
cherished...

00:52.856 --> 00:54.638
protected.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.715
Safety is a feeling
you only value

00:57.740 --> 01:01.417
once it's been stripped
from you.

01:01.442 --> 01:06.186
When someone you trust
spills your secrets.

01:06.248 --> 01:08.215
When someone invades your home.

01:08.434 --> 01:10.743
Or when you're a little girl
staring at the stars

01:10.820 --> 01:12.820
in the desert one night,

01:12.896 --> 01:15.364
and the Devil tries
to drag you into hell.

01:15.441 --> 01:18.826
Or, worse...

01:18.902 --> 01:22.413
when the thing
that makes you unsafe

01:22.423 --> 01:25.999
isn't an invader at all.

01:26.076 --> 01:30.379
What do you do
when the evil you fear

01:30.456 --> 01:33.882
is inside your own mind?

01:33.959 --> 01:37.177
When there may be
no way to kill it

01:37.254 --> 01:40.597
without killing yourself.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.694 --> 01:52.694
You look thin.

01:52.771 --> 01:54.571
So do you.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.115
Really? Thank you.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.294
How are you and Dad doing?

02:00.370 --> 02:03.580
Yeah. Wonderful, of course.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.966
Joan from bridge

02:06.043 --> 02:08.627
tells me you gave her
son a speeding ticket.

02:08.637 --> 02:10.127
Why would you do that?

02:10.139 --> 02:11.505
He was speeding.

02:11.515 --> 02:12.798
But we know his family.

02:12.808 --> 02:14.475
We know everybody's family.

02:25.229 --> 02:28.697
So, is your sister
on her way or...?

02:36.587 --> 02:39.513
We need to talk about Isobel.

02:39.538 --> 02:41.955
Can we talk about the cactus?
I got this for your new office.

02:42.018 --> 02:43.634
I would have come by sooner,
but I've got an alien

02:43.710 --> 02:45.019
on an involuntary psych hold.

02:45.095 --> 02:47.471
I just need one day
of not talking about

02:47.548 --> 02:49.857
or thinking about
or drinking about aliens.

02:49.934 --> 02:52.026
Dr. Avila and I
are gonna present our findings

02:52.102 --> 02:54.978
to the board this afternoon,
and I need to kill it.

02:55.055 --> 02:57.022
Look, I support
your alien cleanse,

02:57.033 --> 03:00.317
but Isobel has no symptoms,
and the psych ward isn't a...

03:00.394 --> 03:02.277
hotel for the real
housewives of New Mexico.

03:02.354 --> 03:03.820
Yeah.

03:03.897 --> 03:07.157
Max told me that she was
having episodic blackouts.

03:07.234 --> 03:10.452
Yeah.

03:10.529 --> 03:12.788
Now and in 2008.

03:12.864 --> 03:15.541
She killed Rosa?
Hey.

03:15.551 --> 03:18.210
There's a lot
I need to tell you.

03:18.221 --> 03:20.554
The visiting hours.

03:20.631 --> 03:23.131
The sign on the door.
"Antisocial patient."

03:23.208 --> 03:25.384
Please.
And look at you.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.394
No tremors, no outbursts.
I know you're in recovery,

03:27.471 --> 03:29.304
but you're... so relaxed.

03:29.381 --> 03:31.273
I'm not relaxed.

03:32.551 --> 03:33.567
I'm trapped.

03:35.596 --> 03:37.446
I'm not going to give up on you.

03:39.779 --> 03:43.114
I'll take time off work.
I'll take care of you. I...

03:43.951 --> 03:46.594
I just want things
to go back to normal.

03:49.216 --> 03:52.041
Things have never been normal
between us.

03:52.052 --> 03:54.293
But I want them to be.

03:54.370 --> 03:57.004
I want to come home with you.

03:57.081 --> 03:59.048
Just...

03:59.059 --> 04:03.302
let me talk to the doctor,
privately. Okay?

04:03.379 --> 04:05.513
Yeah.

04:05.590 --> 04:07.482
There must be some kind of a...

04:09.569 --> 04:11.486
...treatment plan.

04:13.073 --> 04:14.522
You should've told me sooner.

04:14.599 --> 04:16.524
I know. But knowing
has only made me feel worse.

04:16.601 --> 04:18.483
I didn't want to drag you
further into all of this.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.195
I'm in it, Liz.
I've been in it.

04:21.206 --> 04:22.196
Okay.

04:22.273 --> 04:23.248
Rosa was my...

04:25.349 --> 04:26.699
Rosa was my friend, too.

04:30.318 --> 04:33.068
Look, what do we do now?
We can't just... do nothing.

04:33.502 --> 04:35.218
I was working on this serum,

04:35.295 --> 04:36.887
a way to strip Isobel
of her powers.

04:36.964 --> 04:38.524
I figured it might be
a way to help people.

04:38.923 --> 04:40.497
It eliminates
the electromagnetic charge

04:40.574 --> 04:42.707
around Max's
squamous epithelial cells.

04:42.784 --> 04:45.260
So I hypothesize that the charge
is connected to their powers.

04:45.337 --> 04:46.711
So, for all intents
and purposes,

04:46.788 --> 04:48.430
it could render the aliens
powerless.

04:48.507 --> 04:50.424
Human.

04:50.434 --> 04:52.676
But, I mean,
it could do a lot worse, too.

04:52.752 --> 04:54.678
I don't know
how much of their function

04:54.754 --> 04:57.097
is connected to this charge,
so...

04:57.108 --> 05:00.517
I don't exactly have
an alien mouse colony to test.

05:00.594 --> 05:02.611
I mean, it doesn't matter.
The truth is

05:02.688 --> 05:04.729
I never planned on
using the serum anyway.

05:04.806 --> 05:07.023
I was just...

05:07.100 --> 05:10.702
writing an angry letter
with no intention of sending it.

05:22.967 --> 05:24.508
Hey, Sarge.

05:26.470 --> 05:28.587
Alex, I don't know what
you think you're doing here,

05:28.663 --> 05:30.422
but it is not a good idea.

05:30.499 --> 05:32.048
It is not safe for you.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.592
So, for your own good,
you need to leave

05:33.668 --> 05:35.594
and never come back to
this place, you understand me?

05:35.604 --> 05:39.139
Well, I was kind of hoping
that we could go grab a beer.

05:39.150 --> 05:41.433
We could talk
about the family legacy.

05:41.510 --> 05:43.059
Jim Valenti.

05:43.136 --> 05:45.103
And, um, oh, yeah,

05:45.180 --> 05:46.572
aliens.

05:49.809 --> 05:51.735
I have a busy schedule.

05:51.811 --> 05:54.613
I don't have time to discuss
science fiction with you.

05:54.623 --> 05:56.373
All right.
Tried to be polite.

06:00.487 --> 06:04.006
The doctors think that combining
the pills with the wine

06:04.082 --> 06:07.301
caused a psychotic break.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.259
Who knows?

06:16.336 --> 06:17.853
Just Noah.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.304
Bridge club is safe.

06:19.381 --> 06:20.856
Eh.

06:20.933 --> 06:22.357
While I was at the hospital,

06:22.434 --> 06:25.527
they kept asking me
about a family medical history.

06:25.604 --> 06:27.029
I didn't know what to say.

06:27.105 --> 06:28.939
It got me thinking
about the past though.

06:29.015 --> 06:31.024
Well, I never needed
to worry about that.

06:31.035 --> 06:32.526
You never got sick.

06:32.536 --> 06:33.869
Ever.

06:35.730 --> 06:38.373
When you brought
Isobel and I home,

06:38.450 --> 06:41.785
I know we didn't speak any
English or Spanish at the time.

06:41.861 --> 06:43.286
But do you remember
anything else?

06:43.297 --> 06:44.704
Like, was there
something we said

06:44.715 --> 06:46.131
or some way
that we communicated?

06:48.577 --> 06:51.336
You never spoke. Ever.

06:51.413 --> 06:53.055
And I was worried.

06:53.131 --> 06:55.298
But I swore
that you and Isobel knew

06:55.375 --> 06:57.300
what the other was thinking,
always.

06:57.377 --> 06:59.886
At least I knew
you weren't lonely.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.555
And then, all of a sudden,

07:01.565 --> 07:03.473
you both started to talk.

07:03.550 --> 07:06.059
And it was
as if you'd been observing,

07:06.070 --> 07:09.145
waiting to learn
the entire language

07:09.222 --> 07:11.448
before uttering a single word.

07:19.992 --> 07:22.084
Does this mean anything to you?

07:22.160 --> 07:24.744
I'm trying to figure out
if it's from some early memory

07:24.755 --> 07:27.214
or something I saw
before you found us.

07:33.622 --> 07:34.879
Why?

07:34.956 --> 07:36.423
I don't know. It's just...

07:36.433 --> 07:38.934
it's been on my mind, I guess.

07:42.964 --> 07:44.889
When we visited the foster home,

07:44.966 --> 07:47.776
you and Isobel were huddled
in a corner, crying.

07:52.974 --> 07:56.192
And the other boy in the home
had taken a red marker

07:56.269 --> 07:58.954
and had drawn this
all over the walls.

07:59.031 --> 08:01.123
Obsessively.

08:04.461 --> 08:06.962
That poor boy.

08:07.039 --> 08:09.623
He needed special attention.

08:09.633 --> 08:12.801
A wealthy family that could
give him everything he needed.

08:12.878 --> 08:15.462
And, Lord...

08:15.472 --> 08:17.472
I hope he found it.

08:25.983 --> 08:28.525
You killed Rosa Ortecho.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.366
Yes.

08:54.405 --> 08:56.418
Some broken things
can't be fixed.

08:56.443 --> 08:59.208
And some just shouldn't.

09:00.351 --> 09:01.357
I can make you a new sign.

09:01.373 --> 09:05.157
If I wanted a new sign, I'd say,
"Guerin, I need a new sign."

09:05.234 --> 09:07.210
But instead, I said,
"Guerin, fix the broken thing."

09:07.286 --> 09:09.829
It's gonna cost ya.

09:09.905 --> 09:11.756
Pay your bar tab.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.799
Sign repairs.

09:17.815 --> 09:19.607
Free-99. One day only.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.067
Oh.
I'll call you

09:21.143 --> 09:23.152
when you can get it.
Eh, just bring it by the bar.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.829
I'm not giving you my number.

09:24.906 --> 09:26.331
I don't want

09:26.407 --> 09:27.615
your number.

09:29.077 --> 09:30.785
Please tell me
you're not sleeping with Maria.

09:30.861 --> 09:31.711
Never.

09:33.989 --> 09:34.914
What are you doing here?

09:36.468 --> 09:38.125
Does this mean anything to you?

09:38.202 --> 09:40.553
Yeah. It's your tattoo.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.016
Wyatt Long was drawing it
after Grant Green's murder.

09:45.093 --> 09:47.518
He claims he was
just scribbling.

09:47.595 --> 09:49.520
But it's got to have
some connection to me.

09:49.597 --> 09:51.597
Right? According
to my mom,

09:51.674 --> 09:53.349
you were a little terror
at the group home,

09:53.360 --> 09:55.309
drawing it all over the
walls after we were found.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.311
So it's got to have some
connection to us, right?

09:57.388 --> 10:00.031
Maybe it was something
we saw somewhere...

10:00.108 --> 10:01.699
before the crash.

10:01.776 --> 10:03.701
Sorry,

10:03.778 --> 10:05.536
are you, Max Evans,
acknowledging

10:05.613 --> 10:07.372
that we must have had lives

10:07.448 --> 10:09.540
before we hatched
out of the pods?

10:09.617 --> 10:11.209
You never want
to talk about home.

10:11.285 --> 10:12.669
Hey, Roswell is home.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.041
Look, I'm sorry, man.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.711
You're right.
You're right.

10:21.721 --> 10:24.880
I've spent a lot of time not
talking about where we come from

10:24.891 --> 10:26.215
or why we're here.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.217
Keep thinking I can

10:28.228 --> 10:30.970
pretend the past away
and just be normal.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.723
But if Isobel's blackouts

10:33.733 --> 10:36.517
are some alien thing,
then I need to know more.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.070
Okay, and this symbol?

10:39.147 --> 10:40.905
That's all I have to go on.

10:42.367 --> 10:44.734
I mean, don't you think
it's... it's strange

10:44.744 --> 10:46.911
that we don't have any memories?

10:46.988 --> 10:48.904
I mean, no parents, no language.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.573
We weren't infants,
man. We were seven.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.659
I just figured our memory faded.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.004
Over 50 years in those pods.
Maybe it was just time.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.084
Or maybe whoever put us
in those pods...

11:02.095 --> 11:03.678
doesn't want us to remember.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.717
You feel that?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.886
No.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.938
What?

11:14.015 --> 11:16.816
It's like a...

11:18.260 --> 11:20.728
Cold.

11:20.739 --> 11:22.855
Something-something's
wrong with Isobel, man.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.949
We... we got to go.

11:25.026 --> 11:28.068
We got to go.

11:28.145 --> 11:30.029
I just told you we don't know
the side effects,

11:30.105 --> 11:32.740
so why would you... I don't know, Liz.
I just... did it.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.116
I shouldn't have. It goes
completely against my code.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.910
Yeah, Dr. Valenti.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.078
Terrible bedside manner.

11:38.155 --> 11:41.373
She incepted you.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.666
She jumped into your brain,
and she convinced you

11:42.743 --> 11:43.634
that this is
the right thing to do.

11:43.711 --> 11:45.377
That's her power?

11:45.454 --> 11:46.721
Mind control?

11:46.798 --> 11:50.099
It's not control
so much as it is influence.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.144
I'm an influencer.
Oh, God.

11:53.221 --> 11:54.845
Like BadGalRiRi.

11:57.225 --> 11:59.317
Okay. Kyle, just...

11:59.393 --> 12:01.194
text me if she exhibits
any reactions.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.170
Alex?

12:19.247 --> 12:20.922
Morning.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.918
What are you doing?
Well, I'm just trying to spend

12:25.995 --> 12:28.054
a little quality
time with my dad.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.091
Talk to me about
Project Shepherd, Pops.

12:32.167 --> 12:34.310
It doesn't exist.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.767
You know I'm a codebreaker.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.603
I've hacked into Russian
and Chinese intelligence.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.481
This technology
that you're running in here...

12:47.558 --> 12:49.441
it's outdated.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.945
Your encryption software...

12:53.022 --> 12:54.947
is flimsy at best.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.951
So, we can sit here in silence
while I access the database,

12:59.028 --> 13:01.045
or we can talk.
It's your choice.

13:01.122 --> 13:03.455
But either way,

13:03.532 --> 13:05.833
I'm gonna find out
what you've been doing.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.710
I was trying
to do the right thing.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.336
We don't even know
if the blackouts

13:09.413 --> 13:11.005
are connected to what we are.

13:11.081 --> 13:14.508
It could be dissociative
identity disorder or PTSD.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.719
Rosa's autopsy showed
a handprint mark.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.220
That means I killed her

13:18.231 --> 13:21.065
using powers I didn't
even know I have.

13:21.142 --> 13:22.892
If Liz's serum mutes
those powers, great.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.060
I just want to get out of here.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.354
If I'm normal, then I'm safe.

13:27.431 --> 13:29.407
By "normal," you mean human?

13:29.483 --> 13:32.026
By "normal," I mean
I want to be able

13:32.102 --> 13:34.737
to look at my own hands without
wanting to chop them off.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.322
You don't know what
this is like for me.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.208
I can't trust my own mind.

13:40.912 --> 13:43.203
Great. This guy.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.497
The room's private,
not soundproof.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.958
Where's Liz?
She's trying to live her life.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.877
To get some distance
from the homicidal alien.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.212
And yet, here I am.

13:57.511 --> 13:58.769
Whoa.

14:02.183 --> 14:03.465
What are you doing?

14:03.467 --> 14:06.110
I'm trying to get you
to take off your shirt,

14:06.187 --> 14:07.728
but...

14:07.805 --> 14:10.272
it's not working.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.359
It's like I'm broken.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.072
I think the serum worked.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.124
Yeah, me, too.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.997
Okay, so we'll occlude
the coronary artery

14:27.074 --> 14:28.874
of half the mice,
reperfuse it...

14:28.951 --> 14:30.709
And then
sacrifice them two weeks later.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.136
Yes. So we'll section their heart.
Yes.

14:32.213 --> 14:33.712
Hey, congratulations, Liz.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.640
Found a way to punish her.

14:35.716 --> 14:37.141
I'll meet you inside.

14:37.218 --> 14:38.643
It's fine.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.595
Have a good day.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.315
Oh, nice work,
Dr. Frankenstein.

14:44.392 --> 14:46.141
You stripped Isobel
of her identity.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.102
I never planned
to use that serum.

14:48.178 --> 14:50.104
She injected herself.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.823
And you can't deny that
her powers make her dangerous.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.817
The history of your planet

14:54.827 --> 14:56.827
doesn't reflect
kindly upon people

14:56.904 --> 14:58.829
who take it upon themselves
to change people

14:58.906 --> 15:00.823
considered dangerous by society.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.951
This is like drowning witches,

15:04.028 --> 15:05.503
or gay conversion therapy.

15:05.579 --> 15:08.288
What if someone used your lab

15:08.365 --> 15:12.718
to make a serum that...
made you less Mexican?

15:12.795 --> 15:14.679
Would you be cool with that,
even if they-they didn't plan

15:14.755 --> 15:16.163
to use it?

15:16.240 --> 15:18.173
I know you're not making
this comparison to me right now.

15:18.184 --> 15:20.768
She murdered my sister.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.433
You know, Max and Isobel have
this crazy psychic connection.

15:27.509 --> 15:30.978
He can feel her, all the time.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.105
Like this warm presence.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.701
But the moment she injected
herself, he went cold.

15:39.038 --> 15:40.705
If anything

15:40.781 --> 15:43.949
happens to Isobel because
your serum left her vulnerable,

15:44.026 --> 15:46.752
you're gonna be getting
revenge on the wrong person.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.498
Because Max didn't take
your sister from you.

15:51.575 --> 15:56.012
All he ever did...
was love you.

16:01.268 --> 16:04.403
Things will be
different this time.

16:04.413 --> 16:07.489
No more secrets.

16:07.566 --> 16:09.491
Well, let's keep
a few between us.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.326
Like the real reason
we can't go to Luigi's anymore?

16:19.169 --> 16:20.427
Isobel?

16:23.081 --> 16:24.506
Baby...

16:27.461 --> 16:29.344
Isobel?

16:29.421 --> 16:30.771
You paged?

16:30.848 --> 16:33.682
Yeah. A few hours ago,
everything was fine

16:33.758 --> 16:36.184
with Isobel's blood sample, but
suddenly something has changed.

16:36.261 --> 16:39.104
Her cells are degrading rapidly.

16:39.115 --> 16:42.357
The serum is attacking
her cytoplasm.

16:42.434 --> 16:44.118
Her cells are rotting.

16:45.604 --> 16:46.528
What?

16:46.605 --> 16:48.738
Is-Is-Isobel.

16:48.749 --> 16:51.125
At the current rate
of degeneration...

16:51.201 --> 16:53.577
Isobel will be dead
by the end of the day.

16:53.653 --> 16:55.003
I need a doctor!

17:04.413 --> 17:06.130
You have to stop.

17:06.140 --> 17:08.516
I'm gonna try again.
It's not working, Max.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.593
I'm not injured,
you can't heal me.

17:14.723 --> 17:16.932
Hurry.
Noah is in the waiting room.

17:25.492 --> 17:27.576
You gonna barf?
No.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.052
What now?

17:34.129 --> 17:35.762
I...

17:35.839 --> 17:38.098
I'd normally suggest making
phone calls to loved ones.

17:38.175 --> 17:41.059
We... There has to be
something more we can do.

17:41.136 --> 17:42.060
We should call Mom.

17:42.137 --> 17:44.655
No. No.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.944
Why now?
Why today, of all days?

17:51.021 --> 17:54.164
I've been looking for
leverage my entire life.

17:54.241 --> 17:58.001
And then, what do you know?

17:58.078 --> 18:00.078
I find something that
I-I can't quite explain

18:00.155 --> 18:01.713
at the Valenti cabin.

18:05.202 --> 18:08.178
I've actually learned a lot
in these last few weeks.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.590
I went into the Dark Web
and found a world

18:11.666 --> 18:13.016
of government conspiracies.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.926
And you know what,
they all led back to you.

18:15.003 --> 18:18.021
So I followed you
here a few times.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.432
I reconstructed
one of those burner phones

18:20.508 --> 18:21.933
that you're always
throwing away.

18:21.944 --> 18:23.602
And then, finally,

18:23.678 --> 18:24.903
I called Mom.

18:26.723 --> 18:29.482
When you're trying to hack
enemy intelligence,

18:29.559 --> 18:33.078
the key is to find a flaw
in the system and exploit it.

18:34.707 --> 18:36.665
You're the flaw, Dad.

18:48.554 --> 18:52.380
Liz, you-you created this stuff.

18:52.391 --> 18:55.184
You can create the antidote.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.845
There's not enough time.

18:58.922 --> 19:00.647
It...

19:08.223 --> 19:12.359
Alex, I've kept all this
from you for your own good.

19:12.435 --> 19:15.487
Because of this project,
our family, the Valentis,

19:15.563 --> 19:18.240
have suffered for decades.

19:18.316 --> 19:19.741
I'm trying to protect you, son.

19:19.752 --> 19:22.377
So, is Kyle Valenti in the know?

19:26.574 --> 19:28.175
Of course he is.

19:28.252 --> 19:29.209
He's a real man, right?

19:29.286 --> 19:32.003
He's not my child, is he?

19:32.080 --> 19:34.172
I don't have the same obligation
to keep him safe.

19:34.249 --> 19:37.425
Wh-What are you
talking about, Dad?!

19:37.436 --> 19:39.719
When I was 17,
I wanted to make music.

19:39.796 --> 19:40.938
You sent me to war.

19:41.014 --> 19:44.557
You are not trying
to protect me.

19:44.634 --> 19:46.768
You think that I would
compromise your mission.

19:46.779 --> 19:50.697
Because you think I'm weak.
Because I'm gay.

19:57.647 --> 20:00.749
And what's your endgame here?

20:05.038 --> 20:08.915
I want to destroy the
thing that you love.

20:08.992 --> 20:11.009
And I want to make you watch.

20:18.626 --> 20:23.054
Like I said,
I'm trying to protect you.

20:23.131 --> 20:25.932
The project recently confirmed
Michael Guerin's involvement

20:26.009 --> 20:29.436
in terrorist activity.

20:37.312 --> 20:39.279
The hell you doing?

20:40.741 --> 20:42.449
Max thinks you're in your lair,

20:42.525 --> 20:43.908
mixing up a miracle
cure for Isobel.

20:43.985 --> 20:46.036
I am working on it. Okay?

20:46.112 --> 20:47.620
Rosa got all the creative juice
in my family.

20:47.697 --> 20:50.915
The art and dance
and poetry genes were used up

20:50.992 --> 20:52.292
by the time I came along,

20:52.369 --> 20:54.252
so when I need to get
creative, I turn to wine

20:54.329 --> 20:56.963
and Jagged Little Pill,
channel my inner Rosa.

20:58.925 --> 21:02.594
Did you come up with anything?

21:02.670 --> 21:05.305
Yeah.

21:05.382 --> 21:07.357
You.

21:09.010 --> 21:11.862
You're a secret genius.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.980
I could never figure out
why you didn't go to school.

21:14.057 --> 21:16.867
But then I realized,
what you want to learn,

21:16.943 --> 21:19.119
they don't teach at UNM.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.698
What do you know, Michael?

21:23.709 --> 21:25.784
What kind of alien science
do you have up your sleeve?

21:25.860 --> 21:28.119
Nothing I can trust you with.

21:28.196 --> 21:30.121
I am trying to help you.
Oh.

21:30.198 --> 21:33.050
Max may not see you, but I do.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.460
How you manipulated him
into being your lab rat,

21:35.537 --> 21:37.054
how you use him and Valenti.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.056
You don't want to save Isobel,

21:39.132 --> 21:41.725
not after what she did.

21:41.802 --> 21:44.561
Hell, I'm not even
sure I blame you.

21:47.090 --> 21:48.940
But I can't trust you.

21:50.427 --> 21:52.444
I'm gonna go back
to the hospital.

21:54.815 --> 21:57.699
I can't let Max
watch her die alone.

21:59.436 --> 22:03.622
I can't let him
watch her die at all.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.767
Everything you know

22:23.844 --> 22:25.385
about where the three of you
came from is in there?

22:25.462 --> 22:26.845
You mean that hole doesn't
look like the kind of place

22:26.921 --> 22:28.263
you'd hide the secrets
of the universe?

22:28.273 --> 22:29.773
No, it...

22:29.850 --> 22:32.275
And that's the
point. Got it.

22:46.625 --> 22:49.451
Think it used to be
a fallout shelter.

22:49.461 --> 22:52.129
Is that from the UFO?

22:52.205 --> 22:53.872
Unverified,

22:53.948 --> 22:55.582
but.. yeah.

22:55.658 --> 22:57.300
No. Don't...

22:57.377 --> 22:58.793
Don't touch that.

22:58.870 --> 23:01.054
What's under there
won't save Isobel.

23:02.641 --> 23:04.975
Where did you find all of this?

23:05.051 --> 23:07.886
I... dug some of it up,

23:07.962 --> 23:10.889
bought some of it
on the Dark Web, stole anything

23:10.965 --> 23:12.816
legit from the UFO emporium.

23:19.516 --> 23:21.566
You're trying
to rebuild your ship,

23:21.643 --> 23:23.702
aren't you?

23:27.148 --> 23:29.207
Liz.

23:30.461 --> 23:32.002
There's something
you should know...

23:32.078 --> 23:34.504
before we do this.

23:41.037 --> 23:43.171
Ten years ago,

23:43.182 --> 23:45.849
you didn't leave town
of your own volition.

23:47.168 --> 23:49.093
After Rosa died,
Max was a wreck.

23:49.170 --> 23:51.095
He couldn't watch you grieve.

23:51.172 --> 23:53.181
He was gonna break

23:53.192 --> 23:55.433
and he was gonna
tell you the truth,

23:55.510 --> 23:58.311
and we couldn't let him.

23:58.388 --> 24:01.481
So Isobel got inside your head.

24:01.558 --> 24:04.859
She convinced you to leave town.

24:04.870 --> 24:06.861
It's before graduation,

24:06.872 --> 24:09.331
before Rosa's funeral.

24:10.858 --> 24:12.918
Without Max.

24:16.897 --> 24:18.989
Max was gonna tell me the truth?

24:19.066 --> 24:20.583
Yeah.

24:22.281 --> 24:23.780
He was real messed up.

24:23.857 --> 24:26.199
Why are you telling me this?
'Cause I'm tired

24:26.276 --> 24:28.877
of all the lies, and
if I'm gonna let you mess

24:28.954 --> 24:30.045
with Isobel's chemistry,
I want you

24:30.122 --> 24:31.538
to do it knowing all the facts.

24:31.549 --> 24:33.549
Isobel didn't make me leave.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.676
I was always gonna go.
I had a route mapped out

24:35.752 --> 24:37.419
since sophomore year.
You don't understand.

24:37.495 --> 24:41.557
Isobel can't control
people, right?

24:41.582 --> 24:43.716
Just influence them?

24:53.845 --> 24:55.353
What's that?

24:55.430 --> 24:57.948
Max showed you our pods, right?

25:03.401 --> 25:06.411
I extracted this from them
a few years back.

25:09.379 --> 25:13.965
It evaporates upon contact
with Earth's atmosphere,

25:13.990 --> 25:17.733
which makes it pretty hard
to break down the compound.

25:17.898 --> 25:21.083
If-if this liquid kept you
in stasis,

25:21.340 --> 25:24.382
not aging for 50 years, then
that's exactly what we need.

25:24.459 --> 25:27.385
I mean, I have access
to the equipment we need

25:27.462 --> 25:29.763
to figure out its-its
regenerative properties.

25:29.839 --> 25:32.274
Aah! Okay, no. Damn it.
There's not enough time.

25:32.351 --> 25:33.892
Yes. Yes, there is.

25:33.969 --> 25:35.602
You were right.

25:35.613 --> 25:37.896
The two of us working together...

25:37.973 --> 25:39.773
we can figure out a way.

25:39.849 --> 25:40.899
Come on.

25:40.976 --> 25:42.859
I have an idea.

25:42.936 --> 25:45.454
Oh.

25:45.530 --> 25:49.032
How many times do I have to tell
you that reading on the move...

25:49.109 --> 25:50.533
is a dangerous hobby?

25:50.610 --> 25:52.953
Uh, what are you doing here?

25:52.963 --> 25:55.038
Did someone call you?
I-Isobel's fine.

25:55.115 --> 25:57.457
Oh, I know. It's just...

25:57.468 --> 26:00.919
well, Grace Glass went through
this about two years ago.

26:00.996 --> 26:04.139
Skinny margs and anxiety meds.
It happens.

26:04.216 --> 26:07.300
Still, I brought Isobel a robe

26:07.311 --> 26:08.802
and some magazines.

26:08.878 --> 26:10.145
That's great, but she's fine.

26:10.222 --> 26:11.554
You know? She doesn't need...

26:11.631 --> 26:12.481
What?

26:15.677 --> 26:21.106
Of course she doesn't need me.

26:21.182 --> 26:23.733
You know what?

26:23.810 --> 26:25.327
Just give her the magazines.

26:25.404 --> 26:26.662
Wait, Mom, wait.

26:35.363 --> 26:38.173
It's just...

26:38.250 --> 26:42.419
you and Isobel,
you never let me be a mother.

26:42.495 --> 26:44.963
What are you talking about?
Uh...

26:45.040 --> 26:48.016
You and Dad were great parents.

26:48.093 --> 26:49.851
We were happy.

26:49.928 --> 26:52.020
We never needed anything.
Including me.

26:52.097 --> 26:54.856
You guys gave us so much.

26:54.933 --> 26:57.359
Maybe we didn't know
how to ask for more.

26:59.029 --> 27:01.530
Noah's with Isobel right now.

27:01.606 --> 27:03.189
Okay? But I'm sure
she'd love to see you.

27:03.266 --> 27:07.318
It's ok... it's fine.

27:07.395 --> 27:08.870
I'll just come back tomorrow.

27:08.947 --> 27:10.488
Okay.

27:10.565 --> 27:14.034
Okay. Yeah, no, tomorrow...
tomorrow will be great.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.838
Hey, man.

27:26.915 --> 27:29.725
What's going on?
Nobody's given me an update.

27:29.801 --> 27:32.302
She coughed up so much blood.

27:32.378 --> 27:33.311
Is it her liver?

27:35.548 --> 27:37.182
You should talk to Max.

27:37.258 --> 27:38.975
I can't disclose any...

27:39.052 --> 27:39.943
I'm her husband.

27:41.304 --> 27:43.313
I'm next of kin.

27:43.389 --> 27:46.024
Then let me treat her.

27:46.101 --> 27:47.200
Please.

28:24.523 --> 28:27.449
These pods are our key
to stopping time.

28:29.144 --> 28:32.320
To keeping Isobel alive,
in stasis, while we work.

28:32.397 --> 28:37.417
And we just have to figure out
a way to get her in there.

28:39.296 --> 28:41.246
What is that?

28:41.322 --> 28:43.465
Straight nail polish remover.

28:43.542 --> 28:47.877
It won't solve any problems,
but neither does morphine.

28:47.954 --> 28:51.014
I don't understand
why you're being so nice to me.

28:52.250 --> 28:53.517
You know what I did.

28:55.837 --> 28:58.638
I did my medical internship
in Idaho.

28:58.715 --> 29:01.891
I was a cocky bastard.

29:01.968 --> 29:05.228
Thought I'd sail through and
become Dr. McSexy in no time.

29:05.305 --> 29:07.322
But day one,

29:07.399 --> 29:09.315
there was a mass shooting
at a school nearby.

29:09.392 --> 29:12.235
The hospital was chaos.

29:12.312 --> 29:14.112
I was a mess.

29:14.189 --> 29:16.781
You think you know trauma,
and then...

29:20.904 --> 29:23.955
I'm trying to calm parents down
in the waiting room,

29:24.032 --> 29:28.918
and I see on TV that the shooter
was brought to my hospital.

29:28.995 --> 29:31.129
I get back to triage,

29:31.206 --> 29:33.256
and I ask my resident,
"Which one was the killer?"

29:33.333 --> 29:34.599
You know what he said?

29:36.211 --> 29:38.687
He told me to shut up
and do my job.

29:38.763 --> 29:42.140
Because in a hospital, it
doesn't matter what someone did

29:42.217 --> 29:43.733
before they came
through the doors.

29:46.104 --> 29:48.188
And I'm not a murderer.

29:48.198 --> 29:52.108
I'm just a... dying girl.

29:52.185 --> 29:53.776
No.

29:53.853 --> 29:56.121
In here, you're not dying
until you're dead.

29:59.451 --> 30:01.701
Why are you trying
to frame Michael?

30:01.712 --> 30:03.703
Haven't you done enough to him?

30:03.714 --> 30:05.714
You assume I'm framing him
simply because you're blinded

30:05.790 --> 30:07.373
by your perversions.

30:07.384 --> 30:10.251
He has been targeting you
for over a decade now.

30:10.328 --> 30:13.546
Our family is the enemy of
his kind because we spent

30:13.623 --> 30:16.725
70 years trying to protect
humanity from their assault.

30:16.801 --> 30:19.636
He's using you to infiltrate.

30:19.712 --> 30:22.314
Alex, these aliens are monsters,

30:22.390 --> 30:24.307
I mean, are you
reading any of that?

30:24.384 --> 30:26.100
Open your eyes, son!

30:26.177 --> 30:28.061
It's all there,
incident after incident

30:28.137 --> 30:29.812
of unprovoked violence
against innocent...

30:29.889 --> 30:33.191
Do not talk to me
about unprovoked violence!

30:33.216 --> 30:36.017
Do you hear me?

30:36.042 --> 30:39.311
And you are not
looking for justice.

30:39.336 --> 30:42.045
You are using this operation
to target people that you hate.

30:42.070 --> 30:44.754
And that stops right now.

30:49.444 --> 30:51.107
We got to figure out
the key to get in.

30:51.526 --> 30:54.068
If it's tech, there's got to be
a seam that we can penetrate.

30:54.093 --> 30:56.635
Unless it's organic,
and it's some kind of membrane.

30:56.660 --> 30:57.659
How did you withdraw
the substance?

30:57.786 --> 30:59.211
It's trial and error.

30:59.288 --> 31:00.963
Silver needle worked in the end.

31:01.039 --> 31:02.422
You have to go get her.

31:02.499 --> 31:03.808
I will figure this out
by the time you're back.

31:03.884 --> 31:05.768
Isobel doesn't have long.

31:16.034 --> 31:17.431
Silver.

31:30.885 --> 31:32.301
You were right.

31:34.229 --> 31:35.433
I did some reading.

31:36.778 --> 31:38.754
That defibrillator
could have fried me.

31:40.496 --> 31:41.792
Two caskets.

31:44.615 --> 31:47.032
Isobel, I am so...

31:47.163 --> 31:49.814
I am so mad at you.

31:49.954 --> 31:51.995
For doing this to yourself
in the first place,

31:52.020 --> 31:54.872
and for leaving Michael and I
alone on this stupid planet.

31:57.689 --> 32:00.290
You know, all day...

32:00.298 --> 32:03.225
All day I've been thinking...

32:03.301 --> 32:05.319
I wish I loved you less.

32:07.013 --> 32:09.898
'Cause this is not
something I survive.

32:10.830 --> 32:13.068
Okay, if you were trying
to-to slip away

32:13.144 --> 32:16.509
without taking anyone else
with you, you failed.

32:16.534 --> 32:20.211
You failed. You failed.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.842
'Cause losing, losing you

32:28.919 --> 32:31.845
is gonna kill me.

32:33.757 --> 32:35.173
I got good news.

32:35.250 --> 32:38.593
Well, I got news
that's, that's not bad.

32:38.670 --> 32:40.729
We can save her.

32:41.882 --> 32:43.515
It's not ideal,

32:43.592 --> 32:45.317
and things could go wrong, but...
I want to live.

32:47.846 --> 32:49.863
I want a chance.

32:49.940 --> 32:51.698
Yeah.

32:56.855 --> 32:59.698
So here's how this is gonna go.

32:59.774 --> 33:02.209
There's a flight leaving at dawn
for the facility in Niger.

33:02.286 --> 33:05.453
You're gonna decide
to oversee the training.

33:05.530 --> 33:07.956
And when it is time
to come back to the base,

33:08.033 --> 33:10.342
you're gonna request
a transfer out of Roswell.

33:12.287 --> 33:15.338
And if you ever come back,
I will alert the Pentagon

33:15.415 --> 33:17.382
that you have been
running Project Shepherd

33:17.393 --> 33:20.352
for the last eight years.

33:21.897 --> 33:23.305
That's right, Dad.

33:23.381 --> 33:25.974
I know the Feds shut
you down in 2010.

33:26.051 --> 33:27.684
They cut your funding

33:27.761 --> 33:30.020
and you've been running
this farce with family money

33:30.096 --> 33:34.032
against protocol,
against direct orders.

33:36.394 --> 33:38.987
And if you decide
to not do as I say,

33:39.064 --> 33:41.489
I'll expose you.

33:41.566 --> 33:44.126
You'll be dishonorably
discharged.

33:46.613 --> 33:48.297
That will be your legacy.

33:50.283 --> 33:51.258
Not much of a Manes man.

33:57.007 --> 34:00.142
Enjoy your freedom, Pops.

34:22.983 --> 34:26.293
Liz!

34:26.370 --> 34:28.036
They're on their way now.

34:28.112 --> 34:29.630
She wanted
to say goodbye to Noah,

34:29.706 --> 34:31.581
tell him she's going
to rehab, but we can't...

34:31.658 --> 34:33.208
- find him anywhere.
- I think I did it.

34:33.284 --> 34:34.918
I combined synthetic
exothermic enzymes

34:34.995 --> 34:37.137
and melted down my jewelry
to create a solution

34:37.214 --> 34:38.972
that should manipulate the
properties of the membrane.

34:39.049 --> 34:41.174
Michael. Max... Don't fall.

34:41.251 --> 34:42.257
Come sit down.

34:42.335 --> 34:44.260
Okay.
Okay.

34:44.337 --> 34:45.478
How long is she
gonna be in there?

34:45.554 --> 34:48.139
Could take months, years.

34:48.150 --> 34:50.058
We will not stop
until we find a way to save her.

34:50.135 --> 34:52.060
Last time we came out
of those pods,

34:52.071 --> 34:53.987
we lost our memories of home.

34:54.063 --> 34:55.647
What if she comes out,
she doesn't remember us?

34:55.724 --> 34:57.941
We'll remind her.

34:58.018 --> 34:59.826
Of everything.
Hmm.

34:59.903 --> 35:02.237
Promise?
I promise.

35:02.313 --> 35:04.030
Isobel.

35:04.107 --> 35:05.323
Are you ready?

35:05.400 --> 35:06.792
Are you?

35:06.868 --> 35:09.836
Don't ask me that.

37:18.446 --> 37:19.704
Are you okay?

37:21.115 --> 37:22.907
I'm lucky, right?

37:22.983 --> 37:25.951
She has a chance
at survival thanks to you.

37:26.028 --> 37:28.954
Oh, she is going
to survive this.

37:29.031 --> 37:30.414
Liz.

37:30.491 --> 37:32.258
You should forgive her.

37:34.997 --> 37:38.040
Missing her will hurt less
if you aren't angry.

37:48.535 --> 37:51.387
I'm glad she made me
leave town, Max.

37:53.582 --> 37:55.516
I saw two oceans that summer.

37:59.171 --> 38:01.355
Besides, you and I...

38:01.432 --> 38:03.649
weren't meant to be together.

38:36.583 --> 38:38.851
8-A-14, clear.

38:50.189 --> 38:51.813
Nothing's come up.

38:51.890 --> 38:53.407
Fine.

38:53.484 --> 38:55.150
Uh, I'm going out of town.

38:56.937 --> 38:58.904
There's a training program
in Niger

38:58.915 --> 39:00.080
that requires my attention.

39:01.275 --> 39:02.866
Fly safe.

39:02.943 --> 39:05.244
But I need you to be
my eyes and ears while I'm gone.

39:05.320 --> 39:08.664
Should you see any signs of
strange electrical phenomena

39:08.740 --> 39:10.916
or handprints where there
should be no handprints,

39:10.927 --> 39:13.210
I will need to be notified
immediately. Right.

39:13.287 --> 39:16.046
Fractal patterns,
freaky symbols,

39:16.123 --> 39:19.341
handprints... on it.
And additionally,

39:19.418 --> 39:22.177
you're gonna provide me
with some intel on my son.

39:22.254 --> 39:25.055
And remember, I can have
your sister transferred

39:25.132 --> 39:27.524
back to maximum security
with just one call.

39:34.808 --> 39:35.950
Thank you.

39:38.770 --> 39:39.945
That was quick.

39:40.022 --> 39:41.738
Yeah.

39:41.815 --> 39:43.573
Really could've made a new one.

39:43.650 --> 39:45.459
I need this one.

39:45.536 --> 39:48.036
My, my mom's not doing great.

39:48.113 --> 39:49.246
She tends to wander.

39:49.323 --> 39:52.249
But no matter what,
when she sees this sign,

39:52.326 --> 39:54.635
she, she knows she's safe.

39:54.712 --> 39:57.638
She knows it lights
the way home.

40:01.293 --> 40:02.926
Like a beacon.

40:04.671 --> 40:06.013
Hmm.

40:08.058 --> 40:11.101
Figured it'd be something
cheesy like that.

40:11.178 --> 40:12.820
Jerk.

40:20.329 --> 40:22.621
A beacon.

40:27.003 --> 40:28.168
Hey.

40:31.173 --> 40:33.582
I decided to cook you dinner.

40:33.658 --> 40:36.034
Because you do look thin.

40:39.831 --> 40:41.724
Max?

40:44.211 --> 40:46.428
Hey.

40:46.505 --> 40:48.305
Hey.

40:48.382 --> 40:49.648
Hey.
