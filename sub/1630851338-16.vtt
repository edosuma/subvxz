♪ ♪

00:47.347 --> 00:49.681
Mr. Crabtree,
how fast are we going?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.750
I bet 100 miles an hour.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.352
Oh, I can't imagine
it's quite that fast.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.621
Sir, what do you think?

00:55.623 --> 00:58.490
This train?
I'd say 40 miles per hour.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.225
Only?

01:00.227 --> 01:01.426
At least.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.295
40 is pretty standard.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.563
That's correct.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.898
Now, if the track was in better
repair, this train,

01:06.934 --> 01:11.170
The 89, a model 260 mogul,

01:11.172 --> 01:13.705
Weighing 60 tons,
built right here in canada,

01:13.741 --> 01:15.507
Would be capable of speeds...

01:15.642 --> 01:17.242
That's all right, sir.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.445
I don't need to know much more
than how fast it goes.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.515
- George, a word.
- Yes, of course.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.718
Have you given much thought to
which position harry will play?

01:26.787 --> 01:28.921
He's an excellent passer.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.655
He really should be
one of the guards.

01:30.691 --> 01:34.126
Uh, julia, perhaps we should
let george make those decisions.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.861
He is the coach, after all.

01:35.863 --> 01:39.264
Yes, but george should be made
aware of his full abilities,

01:39.266 --> 01:40.398
Don't you think?

01:40.468 --> 01:41.667
Yes, of course.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.668
I'll take your suggestions
into serious consideration.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.604
Thank you, george.
I just want to be helpful.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.005
Yes.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.612
(belton):
Welcome to our fine town,

01:53.614 --> 01:55.481
The illustrious
detective murdoch.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.215
It is an honour.

01:58.018 --> 02:00.752
You must be dr. Ogden?

02:00.754 --> 02:02.554
Alex mckenzie.
Mayor.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.622
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.824
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.359
Ah, where's the team?

02:07.494 --> 02:10.762
Oh! Our coach is just
getting the boys settled.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.365
Most of them have never
been outside of toronto.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.033
(mckenzie chuckles)

02:15.102 --> 02:16.902
Well, we're very grateful
that you could come.

02:17.037 --> 02:20.238
The basketball tournament
has been a big draw

02:20.307 --> 02:21.773
At a much needed time.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.509
Of course. The fire must have
been devastating for everyone.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.577
(belton):
It certainly was.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.845
A large part of
the main street burned down.

02:27.882 --> 02:30.115
But with the money
the tournament has raised,

02:30.250 --> 02:33.251
We should be able to restore
most of the buildings.

02:34.054 --> 02:37.189
Oh! Here he is now. Doctor...

02:37.258 --> 02:39.191
I know who this is.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.259
Dr. James naismith.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.328
An honour.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.130
James, let me
introduce you, please,

02:45.199 --> 02:48.467
To detective william murdoch
and dr. Julia ogden.

02:48.602 --> 02:52.471
Dr. Naismith invented
the game of basketball.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.272
Invented?

02:54.408 --> 02:58.877
Does one invent a game,
or does it simply evolve as...

02:58.879 --> 03:01.547
- William.
- Shall we get started?

03:05.219 --> 03:07.418
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:07.454 --> 03:10.422
Welcome to almonte's
basketball tournament.

03:10.557 --> 03:15.027
We've already raised
1,340 dollars

03:15.162 --> 03:17.529
And 50 cents!

03:17.598 --> 03:18.830
Whoa ho!

03:18.899 --> 03:22.434
The fifty cents I'll be
keeping to cover my expenses.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.836
(crowd laughs)

03:24.905 --> 03:27.172
And now almonte's favourite son

03:27.307 --> 03:30.242
And the inventor of one of
the world's most popular games,

03:30.377 --> 03:31.843
Dr. James naismith.

03:31.979 --> 03:35.714
(crowd cheers)

03:35.783 --> 03:38.650
In recognition of the honour
that you have brought our town,

03:38.785 --> 03:41.919
I'd like to present you
with this key to the city.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.789
(applause)

03:43.791 --> 03:45.923
(naismith): Thank you so much.
Very honoured.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.926
On with the tournament!

03:52.633 --> 03:55.466
You can borrow balls
from our equipment room.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.936
It also doubles
as our weight room.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.404
Ah! Weights.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.273
An activity I'm
very familiar with.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.741
Is that so?

04:03.477 --> 04:04.943
Yes, it is.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.550
Lads, stay back.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.486
Oh my god.

04:15.355 --> 04:16.688
(shanley):
It's the mayor.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.557
Harry!

04:19.526 --> 04:20.958
Cripes!

04:25.499 --> 04:28.300
(ogden):
Well, at first glance,

04:28.302 --> 04:30.568
The cause of death seems clear.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.904
He overexerted himself?

04:32.906 --> 04:35.640
One too many presses
and his arms gave out.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.042
It's possible.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.716
(murdoch):
Well, that's interesting.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.983
(ogden):
What's that?

04:46.020 --> 04:49.721
Both of his heels are scuffed
on newly shined shoes.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.390
As if he was dragged?

04:52.426 --> 04:53.758
That would be my guess.

04:55.262 --> 04:58.063
Well, if he was asphyxiated
due to pressure,

04:58.065 --> 05:00.932
He would have bled
from his nose and mouth

05:00.934 --> 05:03.135
And there'd likely
be petechiae in his eyes.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.804
From the exertion of trying
to lift the bar.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.305
And there's not.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.476
His skull is damaged.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.479
It's a serious wound.

05:14.614 --> 05:16.013
Likely not from this.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.216
He was hit from behind.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.484
With a heavy, dull object.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.621
And then this bar was placed
across his neck

05:22.623 --> 05:24.689
To make it look
like an accident.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.158
Well, it seems we have
a murder on our hands.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.962
Shall we wager that all of
the money he was waving around

05:31.031 --> 05:32.364
Is gone as well?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.032
I wouldn't take
that bet, william.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.639
(hart): I've checked
at least three times.

05:40.641 --> 05:43.241
There's no doubt this is the
knife that killed clara walker.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.709
Jack's knife.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.245
Yes, sorry to say.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.782
Just because it's jack's knife
it doesn't mean he killed clara.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.917
Of course it doesn't.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.786
Do you have any further
need for the body?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.056
- Detective?
- What's that?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.325
Do you have further
need for the body?

06:00.460 --> 06:01.759
No.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.529
Then I shall be returning
her to her parents.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.665
Of course.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.876
Here you go, dear.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.076
Thank you.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.279
Your friend cassiopeia
was by the house today.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.748
Why?

06:23.751 --> 06:24.749
She didn't say.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.086
I see.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.022
You seem perturbed, dear.
Is she not welcome?

06:31.091 --> 06:33.625
This is not any of
your business, arthur.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.560
You can go now.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.167
Good lord.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.634
Poor alex.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.905
I'll assume the funds raised
by the tournament are also gone.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.840
The reason for the murder,
I suppose.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.776
- Could there be any another?
- I would think not.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.779
Alex mckenzie was a good man.
I've known him my whole life.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.181
No one would wish him ill.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.983
Someone did kill him.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.851
Of course.
And it's a damn shame.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.520
I apologize for asking this,

07:02.589 --> 07:04.322
But could you keep
his death quiet

07:04.324 --> 07:06.123
Until the end
of the tournament?

07:06.160 --> 07:08.259
The town was
devastated by the fire

07:08.328 --> 07:11.596
And the game is a huge
boost to their morale.

07:11.731 --> 07:14.866
I still need to speak
with witnesses, suspects.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.468
I can't make any promises.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.269
I understand.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.938
This is a small town.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.606
I doubt it would stay
secret long, anyway.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.476
I wouldn't be so sure
of that, doctor.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.478
Many secrets are buried
in a small town.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.251
Dr. Naismith,
I can't help but notice

07:33.253 --> 07:35.553
That you aren't wearing
your ceremonial key.

07:37.191 --> 07:39.156
I seem to have misplaced it.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.292
I hung it on a hook
in my room,

07:41.361 --> 07:43.728
But in the morning,
wasn't there.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.569
William, I hope
you're not suspecting

07:50.571 --> 07:52.304
Dr. Naismith of being involved.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.171
He invented basketball!

07:55.442 --> 07:57.909
Speaking of which,
our son's game is in an hour.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.912
- There's been a murder.
- There's always a murder.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.113
Julia!

08:02.249 --> 08:04.049
But there's only one
boy's first game.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.119
Fine.
I'll be along shortly.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.788
But I'm not quite finished
with dr. Naismith.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.527
(strange): So mr. Walker
is gone with the wind?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.395
I've had no luck finding him.

08:17.531 --> 08:20.665
Well, I am not a policeman,
but the conclusion seems clear.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.466
Oh? What's that?

08:22.503 --> 08:24.869
He killed his wife,
stole his child and ran off.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.671
Although why one would want
to burden themselv--

08:26.707 --> 08:27.805
He did nothing of the sort.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.340
Jack walker is
an honourable man.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.343
An honourable man
who betrayed you,

08:31.478 --> 08:32.677
Married a woman
he did not love.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.546
- Enough!
- Detective.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.948
There's a problem
at the walker house.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.549
On my way.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.618
No need. They're on
their way to the station.

08:41.555 --> 08:42.887
They?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.422
Clara walker's parents.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.358
(whistle)
(referee): Here we go!

08:46.493 --> 08:49.427
(crowd and player commotion)

08:51.732 --> 08:54.165
Someone cover
the tall blond!

08:55.102 --> 08:56.501
Oh, goodness.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.036
How old is that chap?

08:58.105 --> 09:01.373
All right, look remember
what you did in the streets.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.807
Do what you did there!

09:02.943 --> 09:04.242
But you said that
was illegal, sir.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.379
I don't mean that, sid.
I mean in the game.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.914
You can do the behind-the-back
drop, the block.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.316
The trip up?

09:11.451 --> 09:14.286
Yes! No!
No tripping allowed.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.121
And, uh, harry?

09:16.256 --> 09:17.589
I think you should, um...

09:22.062 --> 09:23.929
I think you should
take fred's place.

09:24.998 --> 09:25.997
Sir?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.600
Just get in there
and shine, son.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.735
All right, lads, let's go.
Let's go!

09:30.870 --> 09:32.737
I thought you wanted us to win?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.606
I'll get you in next
game, freddie.

09:37.010 --> 09:37.742
(whistle)

09:37.811 --> 09:38.909
(referee):
Here we go!

09:40.047 --> 09:41.779
- Over there!
- He's open!

09:42.415 --> 09:43.280
(harry):
I'm open!

09:43.317 --> 09:44.148
(coach):
Here! Come on, boys!

09:46.053 --> 09:47.419
(groans)

09:47.554 --> 09:49.154
Wait! That was a foul!

09:49.957 --> 09:51.889
Here.

09:51.891 --> 09:54.092
Nice try, squirt.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.363
And you'd never seen
this man before?

09:59.399 --> 10:00.965
No.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.833
He came in looking
for the child?

10:02.869 --> 10:04.969
- His name is samuel.
- Yes. Samuel.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.105
Oh, of course.
He came in looking for samuel.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.239
Then what happened?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.641
We told him we didn't
know where samuel was.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.910
And he didn't believe you?

10:11.912 --> 10:15.312
Worse than that.
He nearly killed franklin.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.048
I'll survive, dear.

10:18.318 --> 10:21.853
Would you be able to provide
me with a description?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.755
As best I can.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.856
Are you're sure
you don't know him?

10:26.926 --> 10:28.193
That's what we said.

10:29.596 --> 10:30.595
Why?

10:30.730 --> 10:32.863
Well, it seems to me
that whoever did this

10:32.899 --> 10:34.999
Has some sort of
connection to your family.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.738
I can understand taking
the money, but why kill him?

10:41.842 --> 10:44.175
Perhaps mr. Mckenzie
walked in on the thief.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.079
Why would he have had all
the money in the exercise room?

10:48.214 --> 10:50.715
We don't yet know where
the murder took place.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.618
I believe that
mr. Mckenzie's body

10:53.687 --> 10:56.687
Was moved to the exercise room
after his death.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.823
The killer then
set the scene

10:58.892 --> 11:01.359
To make it appear as though
it were an accident.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.828
Certainly devious.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.296
It is.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.832
And would you know
anyone in this town

11:07.901 --> 11:09.634
Capable of something
like that?

11:09.769 --> 11:12.437
Plumbing for secrets,
detective murdoch?

11:12.439 --> 11:14.972
Comes with the job.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.041
You said you knew some?

11:18.978 --> 11:20.211
They might know more.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.314
Daisy stewart
and robert shanley.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.583
Who are they to the victim?

11:25.619 --> 11:28.386
Alex mckenzie and I grew
up with all of them.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.321
We grew apart over the years.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.123
I sense they are
deeply resentful

11:32.125 --> 11:34.125
Of alex and my
successes.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.794
So you might also be a target?

11:37.797 --> 11:38.730
I doubt that.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.600
It's sad.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.735
The friends of our youth
become our enemies.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.206
Even worse when
they become murderers.

11:54.181 --> 11:57.615
Ways admired alex's
determination to stay in shape

11:57.617 --> 11:59.817
But he was no spring chicken.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.821
You have to acknowledge
your limitations,

12:02.823 --> 12:04.088
No matter what
they are.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.958
Unfortunately, mr. Shanley,

12:06.960 --> 12:09.426
I don't believe mr. Mckenzie's
death was an accident.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.597
You mean someone killed him?

12:12.599 --> 12:14.031
I believe so.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.001
The money he'd been
holding was stolen.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.402
Dear god.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.774
You'd known him a long time?

12:22.776 --> 12:25.442
Yeah.
Since we were children.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.713
And mr. Mckenzie was well liked?

12:29.716 --> 12:30.915
Ha.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.550
As well-liked as any politician.

12:34.654 --> 12:37.522
Why are you asking
about enemies?

12:37.524 --> 12:40.525
You just said over a thousand
dollars had been stolen.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.193
It was.

12:42.328 --> 12:45.230
Well, a fire just destroyed
a good part of this town.

12:45.232 --> 12:48.032
There's no shortage of people
in need of a thousand dollars.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.669
Other than yourself,
who else had access

12:51.671 --> 12:53.404
To the exercise facility?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.039
Anyone.

12:55.041 --> 12:58.142
You hardly need a key
to get into the place.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.747
This is a sketch of a man who
was inquiring after

13:02.816 --> 13:05.283
The whereabouts of clara
and jack's child.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.484
He also assaulted
clara's father.

13:07.521 --> 13:08.686
Bad penny, then?

13:08.822 --> 13:12.090
I'd say. Could it be he is also
the man you saw

13:12.225 --> 13:14.525
Prowling around
mrs. Walker's house?

13:15.562 --> 13:16.961
I suppose.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.963
I had assumed
it was mr. Walker.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.099
Who else would be
prowling around?

13:21.234 --> 13:22.567
And now?

13:22.569 --> 13:26.170
Well, it very well could
be this other fellow.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.440
Make up your mind, woman.
Do you know who this is?

13:30.109 --> 13:30.975
I do not.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.512
I apologize for
my detective's outburst.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.315
We appreciate your help.
Thank you, madam.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.986
From now on, watts,
you report to me on this case.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.589
No, inspector,
that's not necessary.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.857
It bloody well is!

13:45.992 --> 13:47.792
Your judgement
is clouded on this one.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.597
(knock on door)

13:57.170 --> 13:58.469
Detective.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.470
Doctor.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.272
Thank you for coming.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.173
How did your team fare today?

14:04.211 --> 14:06.010
Ooh.
Not very well.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.479
Well, the almonte lads
are a strong side.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.147
I have something.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.482
What is it?

14:11.618 --> 14:14.953
It seems that alex had
designated the amount of payouts

14:14.955 --> 14:17.388
To each business that
was a victim of the fire.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.624
- Strange.
- What's that?

14:20.660 --> 14:23.361
(murdoch): One business is
receiving significantly more

14:23.496 --> 14:24.796
Than the others.

14:24.798 --> 14:27.598
And the mayor's signature.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.501
Oh.
It's different.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.037
Likely not written in his hand.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.507
Who is lillian belton?

14:37.644 --> 14:38.776
She's the woman
who greeted you,

14:38.912 --> 14:41.178
The organizer
of the tournament.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.849
She probably just wants to make
sure harry gets in the game.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.451
So we can lose.
Again!

14:46.586 --> 14:48.986
And we sure will with
a lady coaching us.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.855
Lads, let's just
give her a fair shot.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.057
I thought you were supposed
to be in charge, mr. Crabtree.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.525
- Yeah, coach.
- Just...

14:58.465 --> 14:59.596
Wow.

15:01.868 --> 15:06.203
Well, it's just a pity
that I can't play for the team.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.040
Now, do you want to learn
a little bit about basketball,

15:09.175 --> 15:11.408
Or do you want to leave
the tournament early?

15:12.646 --> 15:15.212
If you're so good then how
come harry is so terrible?

15:15.248 --> 15:16.547
Hey!

15:16.549 --> 15:18.983
Because he's yet to receive
the benefit of my wisdom.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.284
Now line up.

15:22.221 --> 15:24.489
Harry?
Here. Have a go.

15:24.624 --> 15:25.789
Come.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.992
I noticed in your first game

15:28.127 --> 15:31.229
That you're not utilizing
the dribble enough.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.235
All right.
Well, try again.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.070
Hard bounce, nose over toes.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.044
All right!

15:46.046 --> 15:47.711
And again.
That's why we call it practice.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.313
George, can you
gather the balls?

15:53.353 --> 15:54.952
All right.
Who's next?

15:54.988 --> 15:55.919
Somebody else.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.122
(murdoch):
Miss belton.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.792
Ah-ha.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.530
This will all need
to be replaced.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.398
An expensive proposition.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.801
Is that why you forged
the mayor's signature?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.304
What are you talking about?

16:18.878 --> 16:20.411
This was you, was it not?

16:20.413 --> 16:23.747
Mr. Mckenzie had approved
that amount, verbally.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.483
I just wanted it on the record.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.119
With a forged signature.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.694
I am the only woman
proprietor on this street.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.430
I don't have a husband's
money to fall back on.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.966
I suppose I'll never
see that money now.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.367
Oh?

16:44.537 --> 16:47.438
I heard it was stolen
by whoever killed him.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.175
Well, that doesn't mean
you haven't seen it.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.112
If the mayor learned that you
forged his signature

16:54.114 --> 16:56.580
Perhaps that led to
an altercation and...

16:56.649 --> 16:59.283
You think I killed him?
For a thousand dollars?

17:00.686 --> 17:02.453
You certainly needed the money.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.589
I was at home with
my brother all evening.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.657
You can ask him yourself.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.326
And I am hardly the only one
in this town in need of money.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.664
All right.
Who else?

17:13.666 --> 17:15.833
I don't mean to speak ill,

17:16.869 --> 17:18.335
But you should speak
to that one there.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.009
Daisy stewart?

17:25.011 --> 17:27.278
I do feel sorry for her,

17:27.347 --> 17:30.147
But she's never been able
to make a go of anything.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.484
Sometimes,
she does other favours,

17:33.520 --> 17:35.153
If you get my meaning.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.822
Especially for alex mckenzie

17:37.824 --> 17:39.890
And I don't mean
just darning socks.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.827
I see.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.896
Perhaps she expected
something from alex

17:44.898 --> 17:46.396
That he wasn't
prepared to give.

17:50.637 --> 17:51.836
What do you think?

17:53.106 --> 17:55.439
Well, it's certainly
something a woman could handle.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.909
Yes, but could she have
struck him with it?

17:59.212 --> 18:01.044
It's in keeping with
the actions of a woman spurned.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.849
I see no traces
of blood on them.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.250
There wouldn't have been much.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.320
Perhaps when his
head hit the floor?

18:10.990 --> 18:13.658
But still, I find it
hard to believe

18:13.793 --> 18:15.993
That the scuffs on his
shoes would have occurred

18:15.995 --> 18:17.628
Over such
a short distance.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.731
Hm.

18:22.335 --> 18:26.470
What do you suppose this is
doing in a men's exercise room?

18:26.506 --> 18:28.672
Well, that would all depend
on what the mayor was up to,

18:28.708 --> 18:29.873
Wouldn't it?

18:31.010 --> 18:33.277
Oh! Dr. Naismith.
Thank you so much for coming.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.212
- Do you mind, william?
- Of course not.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.014
I asked dr. Naismith to show us

18:37.016 --> 18:39.016
Some of the finer
points of the game.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.152
He did invent it, after all.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.954
Invented.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.021
Yes.
Very good.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.322
Where did you find that?

18:46.426 --> 18:48.692
Are you familiar
with this, dr. Naismith?

18:48.728 --> 18:50.628
It's daisy's. I gave it to her
when we were courting.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.831
You and daisy stewart?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.299
I wasn't aware.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.901
It was a very long time ago.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.237
And then, for a time,
she was due to marry alex,

18:59.372 --> 19:01.338
But he decided
against it.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.208
Do you think it's possible
that miss stewart

19:04.210 --> 19:06.177
Could have killed
mr. Mckenzie?

19:06.312 --> 19:08.045
He did break her heart.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.347
I hear sometimes
those never heal.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.850
But the daisy I knew

19:13.920 --> 19:15.720
Was the farthest thing
from a murderess.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.324
Would it help if I told
you it wasn't mine?

19:20.393 --> 19:22.593
Dr. Naismith confirmed that
he gave it to you as a gift.

19:22.728 --> 19:26.330
I also have a witness who stated
they saw you

19:26.332 --> 19:28.865
Leaving the charity event
last night with the mayor.

19:28.902 --> 19:30.000
That would be mrs. Belton.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.936
I'm not at liberty to say.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.338
Well, you don't have to.
I know.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.008
And, yes, I did leave
with mr. Mckenzie

19:38.044 --> 19:40.043
And we did share
an intimate moment.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.681
So you admit to being at the
scene of the crime last night?

19:43.750 --> 19:45.882
There was no crime committed
while I was there.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.486
Miss stewart,
where is the money?

19:49.488 --> 19:51.689
Do you mean the half dollar
he so generously offered up

19:51.824 --> 19:53.191
For my services?

19:53.326 --> 19:55.927
I'm talking about the thousand
dollars that was stolen.

19:56.062 --> 20:00.097
(laughs)

20:00.133 --> 20:02.433
If I had that, I sure as blazes
wouldn't be

20:02.568 --> 20:05.169
Standing behind
this cart now, would I?

20:10.210 --> 20:12.509
Mrs. Hart
wants to see my books?

20:13.379 --> 20:14.912
She is a partner
in this business.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.380
A junior partner.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.249
Whose financial
contribution was key

20:18.384 --> 20:19.717
To getting
this place open.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.451
- Is that not so?
- It is.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.989
But I sent her my books
just two days ago.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.057
She asked me to take
another look.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.091
Why?

20:29.395 --> 20:30.260
I don't know.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.862
I'm merely an employee.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.065
We're doing quite
well, are we not?

20:35.101 --> 20:36.200
We are.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.602
But between you and I,

20:38.638 --> 20:40.538
My intention is to buy
mrs. Hart out

20:40.673 --> 20:42.473
The first possible
opportunity.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.176
Oh. Why's that?

20:45.311 --> 20:48.879
Perhaps I don't want someone
looking over my shoulder.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.618
If that happens,
I'll need the expertise

20:54.687 --> 20:56.119
Of a man like
yourself.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.293
Hurry up, man.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.297
All right.

21:07.734 --> 21:08.566
There.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.301
Keep going the next block over.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.568
That's enough here.

21:11.638 --> 21:12.703
I'll be at the station house.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.505
One.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.251
(grunting)

21:29.022 --> 21:30.721
Based on your actions,

21:30.790 --> 21:32.657
You may be the man
I've been looking for.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.658
Oh, well, today's
your lucky day.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.060
'cause I've been found.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.409
(naismith):
So I devised an idea.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.478
Hence, the peach basket.

21:54.613 --> 21:57.148
I nailed a peach basket
to the wall

21:57.150 --> 21:59.015
And the players had
to throw it in.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.887
Two years later, I had the idea
to cut the bottom of the basket

22:02.889 --> 22:04.421
For easy retrieval.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.156
The ball would just
fall through.

22:07.459 --> 22:10.694
It took two years for you
to make that idea, sir?

22:11.397 --> 22:12.596
Yes.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.798
Well, enough of that.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.366
You'll be my first volunteer.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.742
Give it a try, son.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.917
Boys, I need your
attention for a moment.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.585
William, we're in
the middle of a practice.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.387
(murdoch):
This will only take a moment.

22:36.522 --> 22:40.657
I need to know if any of you
saw anyone strange

22:40.693 --> 22:42.426
Lurking about
in the locker room?

22:43.096 --> 22:44.594
Just that flower lady.

22:46.599 --> 22:47.798
Anyone else?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.867
I saw someone.

22:49.936 --> 22:50.735
Who?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.269
Him.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.875
Yes.
I was there.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.744
I was trying to dissuade daisy

22:59.879 --> 23:01.879
From having an assignation
with the mayor.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.547
She's a good woman

23:03.682 --> 23:05.649
And I didn't want to
see her degrade herself.

23:06.419 --> 23:07.952
Was it your business?

23:08.087 --> 23:09.152
No.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.222
But she meant something
to me once.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.759
So, her welfare was
important to me.

23:15.828 --> 23:19.095
But I certainly had nothing to
do with alex's murder.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.431
He was a friend.

23:22.435 --> 23:25.368
And I have no need
of the town's money.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.471
Almonte is my birthplace.

23:28.507 --> 23:30.307
I would do nothing to harm it.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.577
Thank you.

23:52.265 --> 23:53.197
Finally.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.467
I must admit for a moment there
I was concerned

23:56.469 --> 23:57.767
That I struck
you too hard.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.938
You'd do well to let
me go right now.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.140
I'm a police officer.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.275
That's not all you are.

24:05.311 --> 24:07.410
I know all about you
and your deviance.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.546
That so?

24:09.615 --> 24:11.415
(kidnapper):
Where's jack walker?

24:11.550 --> 24:12.816
I don't know.

24:12.885 --> 24:13.817
(kidnapper):
Liar!

24:15.054 --> 24:16.687
You and him, you took my son
and I want him back.

24:18.591 --> 24:19.823
Your son?

24:19.826 --> 24:21.225
Me and clara's.

24:23.562 --> 24:24.628
Hardly yours.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.163
You walked out on her.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.966
If mr. Walker hadn't done
the honourable thing.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.301
There is nothing honourable
about men like you.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.838
- Nothing honourable at all.
- All right.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.044
You tell me where
jack walker is.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.611
And my boy.

24:42.381 --> 24:45.182
If you do that, you'll live.

24:48.254 --> 24:49.753
(whistle)

24:49.755 --> 24:51.121
- Pass!
- Let's go, let's go!

24:51.257 --> 24:52.723
Pass, pass!
Excellent, lads.

24:52.725 --> 24:53.590
Good stuff.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.859
You suspect dr.
Naismith of murder?

24:55.928 --> 24:57.194
I'm not sure.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.129
Well, it seems unlikely,
doesn't it?

24:59.198 --> 25:00.931
Stranger things.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.332
And the theft as well?

25:02.368 --> 25:04.702
Yes, but not for him.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.170
What do you mean?

25:06.305 --> 25:09.473
I believe dr. Naismith has a
strong affection

25:09.475 --> 25:10.874
For daisy stewart.

25:10.877 --> 25:14.344
And now with the fire, her life
has become even more difficult.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.880
He may be trying to
do right by her.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.484
I suppose being a doctor
he would be clever enough

25:20.619 --> 25:22.052
To stage
a murder.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.954
Thank you for reminding
me of that.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.256
(whistle)

25:28.227 --> 25:29.793
He's not very good, is he?

25:30.630 --> 25:31.861
No, he's not.

25:33.165 --> 25:34.898
Ah, detective.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.233
Um, I need to speak to you.

25:39.238 --> 25:42.239
Mr. Crabtree, you have to
put him on the bench.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.041
- He's useless.
- All right, freddie.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.642
That is enough.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.578
No, he's right.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.645
I'm useless.

25:51.116 --> 25:52.383
Uh, harry!

25:52.385 --> 25:53.783
(ogden):
Harry.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.586
Harry!

25:58.190 --> 25:59.924
And she hopes to be
able to buy you out

26:00.059 --> 26:01.658
And take ownership
of the club.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.126
She does, does she?

26:03.996 --> 26:06.096
She is making a tidy profit.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.399
So, you've done well for her.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.735
(hart):
And for myself.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.137
- May I speak?
- Of course.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.941
Financially, you are currently
in very good stead.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.276
You hardly need the money
this club generates.

26:20.313 --> 26:21.712
That is true,

26:21.714 --> 26:24.314
But circumstances
can always change.

26:24.383 --> 26:27.384
It's best to keep irons
in many fires.

26:28.354 --> 26:29.386
She's a good woman,
mrs. Hart.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.721
If that were the case,

26:30.856 --> 26:32.689
What is she doing sniffing
around into my affairs?

26:32.725 --> 26:35.693
Mrs. Hart. Oh! Excuse me.
Am I interrupting?

26:35.828 --> 26:36.860
No.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.030
- Have you seen detective watts?
- I haven't.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.565
Is something wrong?

26:41.700 --> 26:44.300
He was supposed to bring me up
to date on the walker case.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.236
If you see him, tell him
I'm looking for him.

26:46.238 --> 26:47.504
Of course, inspector.

26:47.506 --> 26:50.240
Right, then.
I'll, uh, I'll leave you to it.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.914
This is the locker
mr. Naismith was using.

26:57.950 --> 27:01.518
He and mr. Mckenzie both enjoyed
physical exercise and, well,

27:01.587 --> 27:03.253
The door was ajar,
I noticed.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.255
So, when I went to close it...

27:05.257 --> 27:06.857
Well...

27:06.859 --> 27:08.324
Uh, see for yourself.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.330
(murdoch):
No blood on it.

27:14.367 --> 27:17.334
But he could have hit his head

27:17.469 --> 27:19.269
On the floor
after he was struck.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.338
Maybe.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.410
My, my.
Look at that.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.545
Dr. Naismith's
key to the city.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.084
The donation box.

27:37.222 --> 27:39.490
Thank you, mr. Shanley.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.558
I can't believe this.

27:41.627 --> 27:44.394
How could mr. Naismith
do this to our town?

27:56.709 --> 27:58.575
This is likely
the murder weapon.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.047
This key proves that you
were at the scene of the crime

28:03.182 --> 28:04.814
After the ceremony.

28:06.519 --> 28:09.185
And this cashbox, that up until
recently

28:09.221 --> 28:11.387
Held over a thousand dollars,

28:11.424 --> 28:15.626
All were found in a locker
that you were using.

28:15.628 --> 28:17.194
They're not placed there by me.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.695
Can you prove that?

28:18.698 --> 28:20.264
(naismith):
I cannot.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.165
But answer me this.

28:22.234 --> 28:26.136
If I killed my old friend
and robbed this fair city,

28:27.139 --> 28:28.605
Where's the money?

28:29.975 --> 28:31.574
You'll not have my boy.

28:32.611 --> 28:35.345
I told you I don't
know where he is.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.148
This is all part of
your game, isn't it?

28:38.283 --> 28:41.151
Take my son and turn him
into one of yours.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.052
I don't think that's
the way it works.

28:44.457 --> 28:47.624
(kidnapper):
You unclean, ungodly sinners!

28:47.693 --> 28:49.026
I'm a sinner?

28:50.429 --> 28:52.028
You killed
your son's mother.

28:56.602 --> 28:59.202
Because she surrendered him
to the likes of you.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.810
I told you I don't
have the money.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.080
Can we finish this charade so
I can get back to my tournament?

29:17.456 --> 29:19.256
You're still under suspicion.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.325
But am I not charged?

29:21.327 --> 29:23.092
Not at this time.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.733
Ah!
There you are.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.201
What is it?

29:31.237 --> 29:32.602
Harry's quit the team.

29:32.638 --> 29:33.803
He did?

29:33.839 --> 29:36.206
George said he'd try
and talk to him, but...

29:36.275 --> 29:37.541
But what?

29:37.610 --> 29:39.743
I think he needs to
hear from his father.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.278
Oh, right.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.479
- Where is he now?
- The gymnasium.

29:45.684 --> 29:46.950
Strange.

29:47.085 --> 29:48.018
What is?

29:49.421 --> 29:53.423
What's miss belton doing with
daisy stewart's flower cart?

29:55.094 --> 29:57.694
I'll speak with miss belton.
You go talk to your son.

29:58.964 --> 29:59.830
All right.

30:13.445 --> 30:14.912
Everything all right?

30:15.047 --> 30:16.580
(harry):
You heard?

30:16.582 --> 30:17.581
I did.

30:18.783 --> 30:21.051
Well now you know everything
is not all right.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.122
I do not want to play
this game anymore.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.124
I can teach you to get better.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.559
No you can't.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.527
I'm not good.

30:32.931 --> 30:35.465
Well, you certainly never will
be if you don't at least try.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.835
What's the point of trying
something

30:37.970 --> 30:39.769
You're never going
to be good at?

30:40.873 --> 30:44.608
Well, sometimes practising
and getting better

30:44.677 --> 30:46.543
Is a goal in
and of itself.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.546
Yes, but what if you never
get good enough?

30:50.148 --> 30:51.247
Well...

30:52.284 --> 30:53.884
For the fun.

30:54.687 --> 30:57.220
Believe me, this is not fun.

30:59.558 --> 31:00.557
(crabtree):
Sir!

31:01.627 --> 31:02.725
Perhaps I could have
a word with the boy?

31:04.663 --> 31:07.431
You'd be better served
minding your own condition

31:07.566 --> 31:09.499
Than prying into
the matters of this town.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.835
I was just curious

31:11.970 --> 31:14.304
As to why you've assumed
miss stewart's business.

31:14.439 --> 31:17.240
I have no business of my own.
So I bought hers.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.242
And why did she sell it to you?

31:20.079 --> 31:21.311
She said she was leaving town.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.846
She was fed up with this place.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.982
And she had the money for that?

31:26.018 --> 31:28.819
The money I gave her would have
been enough for a train ticket.

31:32.858 --> 31:35.993
You know, harry,
when I was a young lad,

31:36.128 --> 31:38.895
I wasn't much good
at all kinds of things.

31:40.199 --> 31:43.266
Uh, riding horses,
playing cards,

31:44.603 --> 31:45.869
Tying knots.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.671
I would always just
end up with a...

31:48.574 --> 31:49.473
Well, a knot,
I suppose, but...

31:50.709 --> 31:53.110
Oh! Croquet. I once broke
two toes playing croquet.

31:53.112 --> 31:56.279
I was dreadful at it. I was
dreadful at all kinds of things.

31:56.282 --> 31:58.147
But you got good at them.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.683
No, I didn't.

31:59.752 --> 32:02.285
And you know what?
There's no shame in it.

32:02.288 --> 32:06.289
I know. I don't feel bad
because I'm bad at basketball.

32:06.325 --> 32:09.459
I feel bad because
I have to do it.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.229
Well, you know what?

32:13.265 --> 32:14.765
You don't.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.599
My parents.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.769
Your parents want
what's best for you.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.003
I know that to be true.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.105
But...

32:22.107 --> 32:24.307
But even parents can
be wrong, even yours.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.177
Look, stay with the team.

32:27.846 --> 32:28.978
But I said...

32:29.014 --> 32:32.048
Not as a player,
but as my assistant.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.851
Seems like you have
enough of those already.

32:34.887 --> 32:37.587
(laughs)
yes, it seems I do.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.923
But I suppose one more
won't do any harm.

32:40.926 --> 32:42.926
What do you say?
Assistant coach harry.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.597
Let's go.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.335
Said he was going back
to the station.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.069
Well, he never did.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.871
Any idea as to where he's at?

32:54.907 --> 32:57.274
I don't know, sir.
I'll keep looking.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.408
Good lad.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.265
- Miss stewart.
- Oh!

33:23.569 --> 33:25.301
You're not staying for the
final game of the tournament?

33:25.371 --> 33:27.104
Oh, no.
I'm afraid not.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.672
Oh.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.907
Dr. Ogden said
I might find you here.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.308
You're taking a trip?

33:32.310 --> 33:34.211
Indeed I am.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.380
Might I have a word
before you leave?

33:36.515 --> 33:37.547
About what?

33:37.682 --> 33:39.716
Well, for one thing theft.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.451
And for another murder.

33:41.586 --> 33:43.353
I don't know what you
are talking about.

33:44.890 --> 33:47.257
Mr. Shanley.
A word.

33:49.327 --> 33:50.660
Don't let her get on the train.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.028
Oh.

33:53.966 --> 33:55.698
You won't tell me?

33:55.734 --> 33:57.567
Fine.
I've had enough of this.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.769
(watts):
You and me both.

34:00.472 --> 34:01.437
- Oh!
- Oi!

34:02.408 --> 34:03.940
That's a policeman
you're assaulting.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.341
And a fairy.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.376
Who stole my child.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.878
You?
You're the father?

34:08.914 --> 34:11.047
And clara walker's killer.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.083
All right, then.

34:13.218 --> 34:15.285
It's time to pay
the piper, sunshine.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.519
(kidnapper):
All right, then.

34:29.768 --> 34:30.767
Stay down!

34:38.377 --> 34:39.842
Do you want to take
a swing at him?

34:39.878 --> 34:42.245
Uh...
He's not worth it.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.449
Here.
Finish your bloody pretzel.

34:45.584 --> 34:46.449
Ah.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.717
Right, you.
Get up!

34:55.861 --> 34:57.460
How about slim
and fast freddie?

34:57.496 --> 34:58.728
Yes, that just might work.

34:58.797 --> 34:59.596
(harry):
They're good.

34:59.665 --> 35:01.497
George!
George, stop him!

35:03.068 --> 35:04.433
Lads!

35:06.204 --> 35:07.737
(player):
Nice shot!

35:07.873 --> 35:09.372
- Look at all the money!
- Holy crow!

35:09.508 --> 35:11.541
- Go get it!
- Look at all that money!

35:12.544 --> 35:14.577
Mr. Shanley, I'd like a word.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.614
Take your hands off the money.
That's not yours.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.683
Actually, boys,
I'll give a ten-dollar reward

35:19.818 --> 35:21.384
If you can
collect every bill.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.154
Sir, that's very
sporting of you.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.230
I didn't mean to kill him.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.632
What happened?

35:38.637 --> 35:43.140
I picked the lock on his locker
while he was exercising.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.143
He caught me taking the money
out of the cash box.

35:47.212 --> 35:48.511
I panicked.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.713
What the hell are you doing?

35:50.749 --> 35:52.382
Give me that money, you!

35:52.451 --> 35:54.250
I grabbed for
anything I could find

35:54.286 --> 35:56.419
And someone had left
a weight bag there

35:56.421 --> 35:58.087
And I hit him.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.191
And he fell on the floor.

36:04.363 --> 36:05.995
And hit his head?

36:06.031 --> 36:07.197
Yeah.

36:09.134 --> 36:10.733
I went to check on him.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.802
Wasn't breathing.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.740
(murdoch): So you decided to
make it look like an accident.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.611
I did.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.148
And when that didn't work,

36:25.217 --> 36:28.752
You decided to direct
suspicion onto dr. Naismith.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.220
I knew you would never
find him guilty.

36:32.224 --> 36:34.290
I just needed some time.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.562
(murdoch)so that you andd
miss stewart could leave town.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.198
But she didn't know
anything about any of this.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.533
On my word.

36:44.770 --> 36:47.336
You killed a man for her
and she knew nothing of it?

36:48.774 --> 36:50.974
I wanted to give her

36:51.043 --> 36:53.043
The life she deserved.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.379
I love her. I...

36:57.950 --> 36:59.348
I've always loved her.

37:02.353 --> 37:05.521
I couldn't bear to see daisy
living the life she was living.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.993
I was going to give her the
money and we would,

37:10.128 --> 37:11.728
We were going to
leave town.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.731
You were buying her affections,

37:16.702 --> 37:18.201
Not much different
than mr. Mckenzie.

37:18.336 --> 37:19.536
I was going to
give her the money

37:19.671 --> 37:21.137
Whether she wanted
me or not.

37:22.407 --> 37:25.074
I didn't want any
of this to happen!

37:28.313 --> 37:30.880
You won't hang for it.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.016
What will, uh, happen to her?

37:34.019 --> 37:36.485
If she's truly innocent,
nothing.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.889
Thank you.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.300
Right.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.902
Now, I've given this a great
deal of thought, julia.

37:52.971 --> 37:54.236
Obviously.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.172
The key to winning at this game

37:56.241 --> 38:00.043
Is understanding the underlying
scientific principles.

38:00.045 --> 38:03.913
Take, for example,
shooting the ball

38:03.949 --> 38:05.448
At the basket.

38:05.583 --> 38:06.782
In the basket.

38:07.585 --> 38:09.919
Yes julia, in the basket.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.188
Now I've done some
rough calculations.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.990
The average height of each
of the boys on the team

38:15.027 --> 38:17.193
Is five foot,
four inches.

38:17.262 --> 38:18.794
Arms extended overhead

38:18.830 --> 38:21.931
Increases that average
to six foot, ten inches.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.933
Leaving a gap from
the tip of their fingers

38:24.002 --> 38:27.604
To the top
of the basket

38:27.606 --> 38:29.605
Of three feet,

38:29.641 --> 38:31.073
Give or take a few inches.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.509
Obviously.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.709
(laughter)

38:35.914 --> 38:37.280
(murdoch):
Sir?

38:37.349 --> 38:39.048
Has your team won a game yet?

38:41.019 --> 38:42.017
No.

38:42.054 --> 38:43.486
You think you two are helping?

38:43.555 --> 38:46.622
Well, we are trying.

38:46.658 --> 38:47.891
A word of advice...

38:48.760 --> 38:50.426
How are you qualified?

38:50.495 --> 38:53.295
(nurse): Well, I've spent
my entire life in locker rooms.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.298
You need to let the coach
coach the team.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.032
The boys need one
voice to listen to.

38:58.103 --> 38:59.569
Let the man lead.

39:02.640 --> 39:03.839
I suppose you're right.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.274
Yeah, I know I'm right.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.842
By the way, what's
your team name?

39:07.946 --> 39:09.979
Well, we don't have a name yet.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.850
Team needs a name,
something fierce.

39:13.919 --> 39:16.419
Like...
Raptors.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.122
Raptors?

39:19.257 --> 39:21.391
Trust me.
It'll catch on one day.

39:28.667 --> 39:29.932
Who was that man?

39:29.968 --> 39:31.534
Must be from the circus.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.803
At any rate,
the distance...

39:33.872 --> 39:35.939
(crabtree):
Here we go, lads!

39:37.743 --> 39:38.808
Quick passes!

39:38.943 --> 39:40.309
Keep passing!

39:42.948 --> 39:44.314
Oh!

39:44.449 --> 39:45.548
(whistle)

39:45.617 --> 39:46.549
Foul!

39:46.684 --> 39:47.817
Referee!

39:49.020 --> 39:51.421
Freddie!
Are you all right?

39:51.423 --> 39:52.889
Can you play?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.690
I don't think so, sir.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.859
We forfeit unless
we field a full team.

39:59.164 --> 40:00.229
I'll play.

40:01.967 --> 40:02.998
Are you sure?

40:04.703 --> 40:06.635
We're not going to
lose by forfeit.

40:08.407 --> 40:11.307
Now, young harry,

40:11.343 --> 40:13.442
What you
need to do here...

40:13.478 --> 40:15.111
Ah, dr. Naismith, please.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.046
I'm coaching this team.

40:17.048 --> 40:19.849
Harry, just do your best.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.424
William.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.826
I can see.
I can see.

40:31.729 --> 40:32.929
(referee):
Here we go! Come on!

40:36.468 --> 40:38.668
Nose over toes, nose over toes,

40:38.737 --> 40:40.302
Nose over toes,
nose over toes.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.074
I think he broke his ankle!

40:45.076 --> 40:46.075
Julia!

40:46.111 --> 40:48.611
(coach):
Somebody get him!

40:49.781 --> 40:51.814
Harry, we're running out
of time, take the shot!

41:11.036 --> 41:14.136
(applause)

41:15.974 --> 41:17.373
We won a game!

41:24.850 --> 41:26.382
(murdoch):
That's my son.

41:26.451 --> 41:27.851
That's my son.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.054
(crabtree): Well done, lads.
Great effort. Excellent.

41:31.056 --> 41:32.922
- Nice shot, squirt.
- Thanks.

41:34.459 --> 41:35.992
Nicely done, harry.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.526
It was a one in a million shot.

41:37.562 --> 41:40.129
Well, sometimes, young murdoch,
that's all it takes.

41:40.732 --> 41:41.864
(all cheer)

41:41.933 --> 41:42.998
Well done!

42:03.221 --> 42:05.988
Llewellyn, I've been
looking for you.

42:07.559 --> 42:10.493
I would like to apologize
for my disparaging remarks

42:10.495 --> 42:12.028
I made
about your friend.

42:12.097 --> 42:13.496
He did look guilty.

42:13.565 --> 42:15.698
Even I thought so.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.466
Does he know that's
no longer the case?

42:18.003 --> 42:19.201
I don't know.

42:19.237 --> 42:21.971
I've passed on word
to all who know him

42:22.040 --> 42:24.040
That he's no longer
under suspicion,

42:24.042 --> 42:26.976
But I fear he
will not be back.

42:28.246 --> 42:32.048
Perhaps he's taken
this opportunity

42:32.050 --> 42:34.316
To forge a new life
for himself.

42:35.820 --> 42:38.254
At times like this,
opportunities abound.

42:42.394 --> 42:44.259
Can I buy you a drink?

42:49.067 --> 42:50.265
You can now.

43:06.184 --> 43:08.017
(woman): Your apartment's
at the end of the hall.

43:08.152 --> 43:09.819
And it'll be three
dollars a week.

43:09.954 --> 43:11.220
Of course.

43:11.222 --> 43:12.888
Now, have you found someone to
look after the young one?

43:12.958 --> 43:15.557
Uh, samuel.
His name's samuel.

43:16.428 --> 43:17.693
Well, you'll be
in need of a job

43:17.829 --> 43:19.228
And he'll need
be looked after.

43:19.264 --> 43:20.630
My daughter is most able.

43:21.232 --> 43:22.364
Very good.

43:29.174 --> 43:30.773
You'll be most comfortable here.

43:31.509 --> 43:32.808
This is the new world.
