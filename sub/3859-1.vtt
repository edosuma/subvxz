00:36.280 --> 00:39.556
It's an old cliché that a sequel
is never as good as the original.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.758
But director James Whale set that
on its head with <i>Bride of Frankenstein,</i>

00:43.840 --> 00:46.991
the crowning achievement
of Universal's golden age of horror.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.959
Never had a studio lavished so much
production value and acting talent

00:51.040 --> 00:52.837
on a so-called monster movie.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.150
<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>
transcended its genre

00:55.240 --> 00:58.277
and remains one of
Universal's best-loved films.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.396
For Mary Shelley, author of <i>Frankenstein,</i>

01:00.480 --> 01:03.074
the attempted creation
of the monster's bride

01:03.160 --> 01:05.275
was always part of her original vision.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.193
How James Whale and Universal Pictures
played matchmaker

01:08.280 --> 01:11.352
for Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester
is quite a story.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.193
And, like a good cast,
well worth repeating.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.790
<i>Oh. I thought I was alone.</i>

01:32.400 --> 01:34.197
It's one of the great American films.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.795
It's right up there with
<i>Citizen Kane</i> and <i>Sunset Boulevard.</i>

01:38.160 --> 01:41.914
It's usually discussed as
"Oh, just a horror movie",

01:42.000 --> 01:44.070
but it's much more complex.

01:44.160 --> 01:48.278
<i>Do you know who Henry Frankenstein is?</i>
<i>And who you are?</i>

01:48.960 --> 01:51.155
<i>Yes. I know.</i>

01:52.120 --> 01:55.032
<i>Made me from dead.</i>

01:55.120 --> 01:58.476
The various story elements,
the intellectual elements,

01:58.560 --> 02:03.315
the artistic and acting elements
that came to bear in this film,

02:03.400 --> 02:06.756
really crystallised all the things
that had been building

02:06.840 --> 02:09.513
in that genre, at that studio, at that time.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.871
<i>I love dead.</i>

02:13.200 --> 02:15.350
<i>Hate living.</i>

02:15.440 --> 02:18.000
<i>You're wise in your generation.</i>

02:18.080 --> 02:21.072
The <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>
quite simply is the most complex

02:21.160 --> 02:25.836
and most brilliantly achieved
and conceived horror film ever made,

02:25.920 --> 02:31.438
and certainly the crowning jewel in
Universal's initial series of horror films.

02:31.520 --> 02:36.230
<i>You make man like me?</i>

02:36.320 --> 02:38.993
<i>No. Woman.</i>

02:39.760 --> 02:41.557
<i>Friend for you.</i>

02:41.640 --> 02:45.519
It's a wonderful film. It's just delightful.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.909
Certainly there are some scenes

02:48.000 --> 02:51.993
where humour and terror
are all beautifully blended.

02:59.560 --> 03:04.190
When you get into <i>Bride of Frankenstein,</i>
you're making it all up.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.436
There are no rules. The only rules
are those of the imagination.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.556
Whale had an extraordinary imagination.

03:10.640 --> 03:16.272
There are some imaginations which are
best left to go do their own Gothic thing.

03:16.360 --> 03:20.797
<i>This isn't science.</i>
<i>It's more like black magic.</i>

03:21.360 --> 03:24.557
When Universal unleashed
the original <i>Frankenstein</i> in 1931,

03:24.640 --> 03:27.313
it found a new formula
for box-office magic.

03:29.200 --> 03:33.955
In a stunning portrayal, Boris Karloff
was catapulted to international stardom.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.873
James Whale, well-regarded
for his British stage work,

03:36.960 --> 03:40.555
had been imported to Hollywood
for his ability to direct dialogue.

03:40.640 --> 03:44.428
Ironically, as movies were learning
to talk, it was a silent performance

03:44.520 --> 03:47.876
that made the Hollywood careers
of both Karloff and Whale.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.831
Universal's founder, Carl Laemmle,

03:50.920 --> 03:55.516
didn't want his son, Carl Junior, to make
films like <i>Dracula</i> and <i>Frankenstein.</i>

03:55.600 --> 03:57.795
But there was no arguing
with the box office.

03:57.880 --> 04:01.873
As soon as <i>Frankenstein</i> was complete,
the studio began planning a follow-up.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.349
This time it was
the director who objected.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.115
James Whale didn't want to do
a sequel to <i>Frankenstein.</i>

04:08.200 --> 04:10.873
He seemed to be trying to
squirm out of it, as it were,

04:10.960 --> 04:14.191
avoid it, bypass it.
Do something else instead.

04:14.280 --> 04:18.796
He said he'd gotten everything out of
the first one, that he'd "wrung it dry".

04:18.880 --> 04:20.438
Maybe that was the phrase.

04:20.519 --> 04:24.274
You have to remember that <i>Frankenstein</i>
was the <i>Jaws</i> or <i>Star Wars</i> of its day.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.873
It was such a big hit.

04:25.960 --> 04:30.636
The studio had so much invested in it
that finally he agreed to do it.

04:30.720 --> 04:34.759
But again I love the fact that
he only did it on his terms.

04:35.480 --> 04:40.918
Meantime, Universal again teamed Whale
and Karloff for <i>The Old Dark House,</i>

04:41.000 --> 04:46.120
a sardonic thriller that introduced
Whale's mischievous sense of humour.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.951
<i>The Invisible Man,</i> with Claude Rains,
mixed laughs and chills,

04:50.040 --> 04:52.634
and showcased state-of-the-art
special effects.

04:52.720 --> 04:56.599
The effects in <i>The Invisible Man</i>
are just extraordinary.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.353
You still watch them
and wonder how some were done.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.591
<i>You're crazy to know who I am,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

05:03.040 --> 05:05.838
<i>All right</i>/ <i>I'll show you.</i>

05:06.680 --> 05:09.399
<i>There's a souvenir for you.</i>

05:09.960 --> 05:12.155
<i>And one for you.</i>

05:12.240 --> 05:15.038
<i>I'll show you who I am and what I am.</i>

05:18.400 --> 05:20.789
<i>How do you like that, eh?</i>

05:25.000 --> 05:28.959
Whale directed some stylish non-horror
films for Universal in the early '30s,

05:29.040 --> 05:31.759
including <i>By Candlelight</i>
in the manner of Lubitsch,

05:31.840 --> 05:34.559
an adaptation of Galsworthy's
<i>One More River,</i>

05:34.640 --> 05:37.712
and a screwball comedy mystery
<i>Remember Last Night?</i>

05:37.800 --> 05:41.509
He always had very mixed feelings
about his horror films.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.717
He liked them, but he wanted
to be an A-list director.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.553
He wanted to make
the big-money projects,

05:47.640 --> 05:51.315
like John Stahl at Universal did.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.190
And, curiously enough,
who remembers who John Stahl was?

05:55.280 --> 05:58.556
But we all remember the movies
made by James Whale.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.677
Junior Laemmle, who was
the general manager at Universal,

06:01.760 --> 06:04.115
had enormous respect for Whale.

06:04.200 --> 06:09.069
I think that he felt that certainly
what Whale had done

06:09.160 --> 06:12.709
with <i>Frankenstein, The Old Dark House,</i>
<i>The Invisible Man,</i>

06:12.800 --> 06:16.634
with the other non-horror-genre films
that he had done,

06:16.720 --> 06:18.870
showed a great stylist at work.

06:18.960 --> 06:23.078
Although Junior Laemmle himself
was not a creative man,

06:23.160 --> 06:27.597
he had a very instinctive feel, I think,
for something that was good.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.832
I think he felt James Whale
was the director at Universal

06:31.920 --> 06:35.515
who probably had the best chance
of putting Universal on par with MGM,

06:35.600 --> 06:39.479
and with Warner Bros,
and with the big boys in Hollywood.

06:39.560 --> 06:43.792
So he really gave him free rein to do
whatever he wanted with the picture.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.158
After rejecting several scripts
for the <i>Frankenstein</i> sequel,

06:47.240 --> 06:50.550
Whale took personal control
over the screenplay's development.

06:50.640 --> 06:55.760
The fact that Whale didn't especially want
to make the film, and then agreed to,

06:56.880 --> 07:04.355
prompted him to offer ideas for the script
to the writers. Suggest things.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.477
At least, we have a very good indication
that he did this.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.313
People such as Elsa Lanchester
mentioned this,

07:10.400 --> 07:13.073
that this was his idea,
that that was his idea.

07:13.160 --> 07:16.277
The little people in the bottles
was his idea.

07:16.360 --> 07:21.309
He insisted that he have
the opening prologue

07:21.400 --> 07:24.312
with Mary Shelley
and Byron and Percy Shelley.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.198
That was essential,
otherwise he wouldn't do it.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.510
Elsa Lanchester, for example, told me

07:29.600 --> 07:37.439
that Whale insisted that she be
allowed to play Mary Shelley,

07:37.520 --> 07:39.988
and also the bride.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.198
It was either that
or he wouldn't make the film.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.829
It was a great thrill to meet
Elsa Lanchester. I met her in 1981.

07:47.920 --> 07:53.517
She said that it was Whale's intention
to show that very pretty people,

07:53.600 --> 07:56.398
which is how Mary Shelley
is presented in the film,

07:56.480 --> 07:58.994
actually inside
have very wicked thoughts.

07:59.080 --> 08:03.039
<i>Can you believe that lovely brow</i>
<i>conceived of Frankenstein?</i>

08:03.120 --> 08:07.033
<i>A monster created from cadavers</i>
<i>out of rifled graves?</i>

08:07.120 --> 08:10.396
The money was available to him

08:10.480 --> 08:14.473
to make a much more elaborate film
than the first one.

08:14.680 --> 08:19.117
Because of the success,
they let him go with the sets,

08:19.200 --> 08:23.318
and go with the care and the time
and the photography and the music,

08:23.400 --> 08:26.949
so that he could polish
and refine and elaborate,

08:27.040 --> 08:32.114
in a way that the earlier films, which were
made faster, wouldn't have permitted.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.111
It's an odd sequel in many ways.

08:34.200 --> 08:38.318
For example, after a brief glimpse of
the monster in the beginning of the movie,

08:38.400 --> 08:43.076
he doesn't show up again for a half-hour,
a third of the way into the movie.

08:43.159 --> 08:48.109
Meanwhile, you've spent most of your
time with this odd character, Dr Pretorius.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.191
I think if you look at Dr Pretorius,

08:50.280 --> 08:54.671
that's an example of how the movie has
changed so radically from the first one.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.912
In the first one, there was
the boring Dr Waldman.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.879
And in this one, suddenly
there's this full-blown eccentric,

09:02.960 --> 09:05.554
very, very gay and funny character,

09:05.640 --> 09:08.393
that was created by Whale

09:08.480 --> 09:11.677
in the development of the screenplay
for the second film.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.271
<i>Frankenstein.</i>

09:15.560 --> 09:19.189
<i>Yes, there have been developments</i>
<i>since he came to me.</i>

09:19.520 --> 09:24.958
Unlike the original film, Mary Shelley's
novel featured a highly articulate monster.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.952
<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>
restored the monster's speech.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.838
<i>Before you came, I was all alone.</i>

09:31.680 --> 09:33.875
<i>It is bad to be alone.</i>

09:33.960 --> 09:37.191
<i>Alone. Bad.</i>

09:38.080 --> 09:40.230
<i>Friend. Good.</i>

09:40.320 --> 09:44.393
Speech was the essential difference
between the original <i>Frankenstein</i>

09:44.480 --> 09:46.198
and the <i>Bride of Frankenstein.</i>

09:46.280 --> 09:52.150
My father really objected
to the monster being given speech.

09:52.240 --> 09:57.792
He felt it would take away
from the original portrayal,

09:57.880 --> 10:01.190
and I think he was wrong.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.590
Cinema history has proven him wrong.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.911
It's one of the few sequels that really...

10:08.000 --> 10:12.118
most film critics regard
as surpassing the original.

10:12.760 --> 10:16.469
Once more, Boris Karloff faced
a gruelling and uncomfortable make-up,

10:16.560 --> 10:19.154
designed and applied
by the legendary Jack Pierce.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.231
One of the changes in the make-up,

10:21.320 --> 10:24.039
besides the fact that Karloff
had gained weight...

10:24.120 --> 10:27.795
He wasn't as cadaverous.
I think success...

10:28.280 --> 10:32.751
He was able to eat more and
unfortunately he had a little fuller face.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.752
But one of the biggest changes
was the results of the fire.

10:35.840 --> 10:39.116
So they singed his hair off
and gave him almost this crew cut,

10:39.200 --> 10:42.590
which through the film grows,
which I thought was pretty neat.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.116
His make-up goes through four
or five stages of regeneration,

10:46.200 --> 10:50.398
allowing him to grow both visually
as well as spiritually as the film unfolds.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.871
They gave him a burn on his hand and
a bit of a burn on this side of his face.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.072
But other than that the make-up
was basically the same.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.516
The flat head, and they still had
the electrodes in the brow.

11:02.600 --> 11:07.879
Just a slightly fuller face with a few
little burn scars and the singed-off hair.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.838
A great make-up.
Actually there was another change.

11:10.920 --> 11:15.710
In the original make-up, he only had one
clamp on his head - this side actually.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.555
It was something they didn't notice
for the longest time.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.435
You would see pictures from the <i>Bride,</i>

11:23.520 --> 11:27.798
and you saw the two big clamps, the little
ones in-between and the ones on the side.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.793
I used to always assume that was
the same on the original make-up.

11:31.880 --> 11:35.236
Later, when I started looking at it,
I said "He only has one clamp."

11:35.760 --> 11:39.878
During the filming of <i>Frankenstein,</i>
Karloff sustained a serious back injury,

11:39.960 --> 11:43.794
and suffered many discomforts due to
the weighted boots and padded costume.

11:43.880 --> 11:46.917
For the sequel, efforts were made
to lessen the ordeal.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.195
I'm sure they treated him more like a star,

11:49.280 --> 11:53.876
because he was successful with
<i>Frankenstein</i> and some films after that.

11:53.960 --> 11:59.830
I think that, in the original, the top of his
head was probably fabricated each day,

11:59.920 --> 12:01.956
built up out of cotton and collodion.

12:02.040 --> 12:06.591
In the <i>Bride</i> and the <i>Son</i> later on,
there was a rubber forehead that went on,

12:07.520 --> 12:10.956
which probably sped up the process
for Boris and Jack.

12:11.040 --> 12:16.990
I know they gave Karloff a slant board,
because he still couldn't quite sit down.

12:17.080 --> 12:22.552
I have a picture in my office of him in this
great slant board, drinking a cup of tea.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.636
The make-up posed technical challenges
for cinematographer John Mescall,

12:26.720 --> 12:29.951
who required special lighting
for the monster's skin tones.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.955
Jack Pierce's make-up for the monster
essentially was a blue-green colour.

12:35.040 --> 12:39.955
This was not due to any belief in
a colour aesthetic for the monster.

12:40.040 --> 12:44.477
But if the monster were photographed
wearing this shade of greasepaint,

12:44.560 --> 12:46.551
on orthochromatic film,

12:46.640 --> 12:50.315
and if he was lit as Mescall lit him,
with blue-gelled light,

12:50.400 --> 12:52.755
he would read as dead white.

12:52.840 --> 12:59.279
Mescall had red added into the make-up
of those who had scenes with the monster

12:59.360 --> 13:01.396
and often trained warmer lights on them.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.473
The make-up for the Bride of
Frankenstein is an absolute masterpiece.

13:05.560 --> 13:10.190
It's the only iconic female monster
to ever come out of the movies.

13:10.280 --> 13:14.592
I mean, if you were to think of
a classic female monster,

13:14.680 --> 13:17.319
it's the Bride of Frankenstein
that comes to mind.

13:17.400 --> 13:22.155
The Elsa Lanchester make-up was
very different from the Karloff make-up.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.550
I'm sure what they wanted to do
was have her attractive.

13:25.640 --> 13:29.952
You didn't want to have
a hideous woman monster.

13:30.040 --> 13:33.032
I don't know if it was
an executive decision or what.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.111
"We can't have an ugly woman monster."

13:35.200 --> 13:39.159
So they came up with this...
again, another icon.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.992
You think of the Bride of Frankenstein,
everybody knows that wacky hairstyle.

13:44.080 --> 13:47.675
It had that Egyptian Nefertiti look to it.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.878
They had this wire cage on her head and
that was really her hair mixed in with it.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.554
They probably filled it in
with some crepe wool.

13:54.640 --> 13:57.837
And the white streaks,
the crazy white streaks.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.029
Yet she was very made-up, almost
wore basically a glamour make-up.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.429
If it wasn't for the scar around the neck,

14:05.520 --> 14:09.638
it would have looked like some
glamorous woman with a wacky hairstyle.

14:09.720 --> 14:13.633
I heard that Elsa Lanchester
wasn't too fond of Pierce,

14:15.200 --> 14:17.191
which I was sorry to hear.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.033
Someone who I idolise like Jack Pierce.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.839
I've heard from people that
he was a crotchety old guy.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.036
Elsa Lanchester talked about Jack Pierce,

14:25.120 --> 14:28.556
and she said that he was
an unusual personality.

14:28.640 --> 14:33.395
He really almost felt, in her opinion,
that he was a god

14:33.480 --> 14:37.632
who created these horror characters
that Universal marketed.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.551
In the morning, he'd be all dressed up
in a surgeon's smock

14:41.640 --> 14:43.790
as if he were about to
perform an operation.

14:43.880 --> 14:49.591
She said you went into his sanctum
sanctorum to have the make-up done,

14:49.680 --> 14:51.671
and you waited for him to say hello.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.354
You didn't say hello first.
He had to say hello first.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.749
So he was very, very much in control.

14:56.840 --> 15:02.233
He really was a divine presence within his
own realm of creating these make-ups.

15:02.960 --> 15:07.875
She was very funny. She talked about
the scar under the neck of the bride.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.836
She said that Jack Pierce
took the longest time to do this,

15:11.920 --> 15:17.517
that he went through this incredible ritual
of applying this scar,

15:17.600 --> 15:19.591
that she said hardly shows in the film.

15:19.680 --> 15:23.355
She said "I'm sure he could have bought
a scar for ten cents in a joke shop."

15:23.440 --> 15:26.238
But he had his own way of doing it,

15:26.320 --> 15:31.792
and he lovingly and painstakingly applied
this scar each morning to the bride.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.869
The idea of the hiss of the female monster

15:36.960 --> 15:41.431
came from she and Charles Laughton
feeding the swans at Regents Park.

15:41.520 --> 15:46.913
She said "When swans would come up, if
you went to feed them, that was all right,

15:47.000 --> 15:51.118
but if you got too near them or got near
their young, they would hiss."

15:51.200 --> 15:54.272
So she thought of this
incredible hiss of the swans

15:54.360 --> 15:57.158
and she incorporated it into the character.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.473
<i>Frankenstein</i> combined English
and American actors,

16:00.560 --> 16:02.551
not always convincingly.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.393
<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i> was cast
mainly with British players.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.391
Mae Clarke, the original Elizabeth,

16:07.480 --> 16:10.677
was replaced by the 17-year-old ingénue
Valerie Hobson.

16:10.760 --> 16:14.548
Valerie Hobson gives an amazing
performance, I think, as Elizabeth.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.234
Very stylised. She's like
a Christmas angel,

16:17.320 --> 16:20.915
the way she appears with the dress
and the flowing hair.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.154
I talked to her in 1989 and she had
warm memories of making the film.

16:26.240 --> 16:30.028
She said the first time she saw Karloff,
it was an extraordinary experience.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.237
There he was in complete
Frankenstein monster make-up,

16:33.320 --> 16:37.518
and she said "I just was so amazed.
All of a sudden he opened his mouth

16:37.600 --> 16:42.116
and out came this very gentle
British accent with a lisp."

16:42.200 --> 16:46.591
She said that he was like
the great clowns who make you cry.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.477
He really made you cry.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.838
This monster whose heart was just
bleeding to get out of his monstrous self,

16:52.920 --> 16:56.037
to find somebody to love,
to find somebody to love him in return.

16:56.120 --> 17:00.398
And he pulled it off. Remarkable feat
of acting. She was very impressed by it.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.119
Valerie Hobson was very
appreciative of James Whale.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.272
Not only was he a great director,
but he was, as she put it, so English.

17:07.359 --> 17:11.717
Here she was, a 17-year-old
British girl in Hollywood,

17:11.800 --> 17:13.869
and he made her feel very much at home.

17:13.960 --> 17:17.919
She said she was the victim of
James Whale's rather bizarre wit,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.595
because the first time she met
Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein,

17:21.680 --> 17:25.877
it was the scene where she becomes
hysterical and falls into bed with him.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.315
As they rehearsed this scene
and she fell into bed,

17:28.400 --> 17:32.313
James Whale said "Mr Clive, this is Miss
Hobson." And she was in bed with him.

17:32.400 --> 17:37.349
So she said it was pretty strange,
even for Hollywood, as an introduction.

17:37.760 --> 17:42.914
Colin Clive played Henry Frankenstein
again in one of his last performances.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.471
Emotionally tortured and ravaged by
alcohol, he died two years later aged 37.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.354
Frankenstein's mentor,
Dr Septimus Pretorius,

17:50.440 --> 17:52.476
a role originally
intended for Claude Rains,

17:52.560 --> 17:56.394
was played by James Whale's real-life
theatrical mentor, Ernest Thesiger,

17:56.480 --> 17:59.552
an actor reportedly
just as eccentric off-screen as on.

17:59.640 --> 18:03.758
<i>To a new world of gods and monsters.</i>

18:05.680 --> 18:08.831
Una O'Connor, who was in <i>The Invisible</i>
<i>Man,</i> was another Whale favourite

18:08.920 --> 18:12.674
and a perfect choice for Frankenstein's
twittering housekeeper, Minnie.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.638
Although Frankenstein's assistant,
played by Dwight Frye,

18:15.720 --> 18:17.472
met a nasty end in the first film,

18:17.560 --> 18:20.028
James Whale combined
several small parts

18:20.120 --> 18:22.236
to give the actor
a memorable assignment.

18:22.320 --> 18:27.348
Fritz von Frankenstein of course had been
killed by the monster in <i>Frankenstein.</i>

18:27.440 --> 18:32.468
Jimmy Whale - I say Jimmy Whale
because that's what my father called him -

18:33.840 --> 18:35.319
liked my dad's work.

18:35.400 --> 18:39.871
<i>What we need is a female victim</i>
<i>of sudden death. Can you do it?</i>

18:39.960 --> 18:42.633
<i>If you promise me a thousand crowns.</i>

18:42.720 --> 18:46.076
<i>It will be well worth it,</i>
<i>and the baron will pay.</i>

18:46.800 --> 18:48.199
<i>I'll try.</i>

18:48.720 --> 18:51.712
<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i> is visually
the best Universal horror classic,

18:51.800 --> 18:55.873
thanks to art director Charles Hall
and cinematographer John Mescall.

18:55.960 --> 19:00.158
Expressionistic tricks,
totally artificial lighting,

19:00.240 --> 19:02.231
these great painted skyscapes,

19:02.320 --> 19:06.438
and the way the tombs
are all at weird angles.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.511
Magnificent stuff like that.

19:08.880 --> 19:13.510
One of the things that intrigues me about
Whale's career, his work in general,

19:13.600 --> 19:16.910
is the background...
the backgrounds that he had.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.118
That is, as a theatre actor
and theatre director,

19:21.200 --> 19:24.909
but as a set designer in theatre,
as well as a painter and so forth.

19:25.240 --> 19:32.191
One wonders to what extent he might
have had input into the visual appearance,

19:32.280 --> 19:34.919
the look of the sets of his films,

19:35.000 --> 19:40.472
in a way that most directors at that time
would not be likely to do.

19:40.560 --> 19:44.633
Elsa Lanchester said, when she was not
actually needed on the set at one point,

19:44.720 --> 19:49.157
he took her to the studio
and showed off the forest set.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.914
He was proud of his achievement here.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.668
I said "Was this his design?"

19:56.760 --> 19:58.751
This telephone-pole forest,

19:58.840 --> 20:02.719
where the tree trunks are just trunks
and it's just bare and stark,

20:02.800 --> 20:05.030
in contrast to earlier,

20:05.120 --> 20:12.276
when there's a bucolic scene
and it's a very attractive nature forest.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.828
She said "Yes, of course it was his idea."

20:14.920 --> 20:17.354
Not that he drew the plans for it,

20:17.440 --> 20:20.750
but he would give the ideas
and maybe make little sketches

20:20.840 --> 20:25.038
and give them to the department heads
and have them develop it.

20:25.360 --> 20:29.035
Cinematographer Mescall achieved new
visual heights with <i>Bride of Frankenstein,</i>

20:29.120 --> 20:32.112
the result of a seasoned working
relationship with Whale.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.715
John Mescall did a total of five pictures
with James Whale.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.836
<i>Bride</i> is probably his best remembered.

20:37.920 --> 20:43.677
The film itself is probably the high-mark
of Whale's late period at Universal.

20:44.240 --> 20:48.153
Mescall used a style of lighting
he referred to as Rembrandt lighting,

20:48.240 --> 20:51.710
which was to use a central light

20:51.800 --> 20:55.190
and a cross-light about three-quarters
through the scene,

20:55.280 --> 21:00.035
to provide illumination of the subject
against a dark background.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.839
It's very much like
Rembrandt's painting style,

21:02.920 --> 21:07.357
where there is light that is directional
and gives contours and definition.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.476
The crowning touch in
<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>

21:17.560 --> 21:20.632
was the inspired musical score
by Franz Waxman.

21:20.720 --> 21:24.918
You've got a first-rate cast
in an extremely well-written script

21:25.000 --> 21:27.560
with a tremendous musical score.

21:27.640 --> 21:31.519
One of the most important Hollywood
scores of the mid-'30s by Franz Waxman.

21:31.600 --> 21:36.754
For the opening sequence of Byron and
Shelley on a stormy evening at the villa,

21:36.840 --> 21:40.674
Waxman wrote a very charming
period-style minuet,

21:40.760 --> 21:44.594
which speaks of the life of ease
and delicacy that we see depicted.

21:44.680 --> 21:49.549
As the flashback story is told by Byron...
"A winter setting in the churchyard..."

21:49.640 --> 21:52.279
...he evolves into a huge fugue

21:52.360 --> 21:56.239
to illustrate the horrors and terrors
of the original story,

21:56.320 --> 21:59.118
before returning back to the minuet

21:59.200 --> 22:02.237
that sets us pretty much
with period parlour music.

22:02.320 --> 22:06.108
There is an awful lot of commentary
through the music.

22:06.680 --> 22:11.231
Sometimes impish, sometimes
emotionally reinforcing,

22:11.320 --> 22:14.073
but, like so much that's
in this film, heightened.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.958
The basic structure of Waxman's score
is Wagnerian.

22:17.040 --> 22:21.670
He uses motives for each of
the major characters or sequences.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.796
These are thematic building blocks

22:23.880 --> 22:26.758
which can introduce or herald
each character's entrance

22:26.840 --> 22:30.116
or imply their presence off-camera
when they aren't present.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.191
Almost operatically, isn't it?

22:32.280 --> 22:34.999
The leitmotif approach,

22:35.080 --> 22:39.710
where you have a particular phrase
or melody associated with a person,

22:39.800 --> 22:41.836
one character or a different character.

22:41.920 --> 22:46.038
The monster has a four-note motive which
seems to be patterned upon his growl.

22:50.080 --> 22:55.200
It's almost as if Waxman had observed
the performance and deduced that from it.

22:55.280 --> 23:00.479
The bride herself has a very exotic
high-flown three-note melody.

23:05.280 --> 23:10.354
It is very open-ended and that allows it
to be utilised in many different forms.

23:10.440 --> 23:15.434
We first hear it, narrative-wise, when
Pretorius speaks of her imminent birth.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.509
- <i>Friend for you.</i>
- <i>Woman?</i>

23:20.200 --> 23:22.839
<i>Friend. Yes.</i>

23:23.600 --> 23:27.388
Dr Pretorius, who is the kind of
Mephistophelean interloper.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.950
He's a figure both of humour
and tremendous evil.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.749
He has a very mad, loping theme.

23:40.760 --> 23:44.116
It portends all kinds of things to come,

23:44.200 --> 23:48.830
usually resolved with a small coda, which
is again open-ended and unresolved.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.754
You never know what Pretorius is going
to do or where his actions will lead.

23:53.240 --> 23:57.791
There's a wonderful sequence,
where he is slightly drunk in the crypt,

23:57.880 --> 24:01.759
dreaming of monsters to come,
and is surprised by the Karloff creature.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.831
It's done in a very metric fashion,

24:03.920 --> 24:06.480
recalling the <i>Danse Macabre</i>
of Saint-Saëns.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.393
In fact Waxman called the cue
<i>Danse Macabre.</i>

24:10.080 --> 24:14.710
<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i> attracted
censorship, during and after production.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.791
The prologue was shortened,

24:16.880 --> 24:20.395
in part to eliminate all close-ups
of Elsa Lanchester's décolletage.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.198
That was just the beginning.

24:22.280 --> 24:27.070
The film had about 15 minutes of cuts
made before it was nationally released.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.158
I think again Universal
was trying to play it safe.

24:30.240 --> 24:35.075
The film was incredibly outrageous
and in some ways almost subversive.

24:35.160 --> 24:39.438
I think they wanted to make sure
it didn't get them in too much trouble.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.114
Like all Hollywood scripts,
the script for the <i>Bride</i>

24:42.200 --> 24:46.796
had to be presented to the Breen office,
the censorship board within Hollywood,

24:46.880 --> 24:50.190
to have approval and discussion
of any objectionable issues.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.840
The script contained
many religious references,

24:52.920 --> 24:57.755
some of which could be intended or
construed as bordering on blasphemy.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.116
<i>It may be that I'm intended</i>
<i>to know the secret of life.</i>

25:01.840 --> 25:04.400
<i>It may be part of the divine plan.</i>

25:04.480 --> 25:07.597
<i>Henry, don't say those things.</i>
<i>Don't think them.</i>

25:07.680 --> 25:11.150
<i>It's blasphemous and wicked.</i>
<i>We are not meant to know those things.</i>

25:11.240 --> 25:13.674
The monster is man-made, not God-made,

25:13.760 --> 25:18.675
but he goes through a Christ-like orbit of
misunderstanding and ultimate betrayal.

25:18.760 --> 25:22.435
The original script had the monster
mistaking the figure on a crucifix

25:22.520 --> 25:25.398
for a suffering, persecuted creature
like himself.

25:25.480 --> 25:31.077
The censors would have none of that,
so now the Christus is a background prop

25:31.160 --> 25:34.948
and he instead - more blasphemously -
topples the statue of a bishop,

25:35.040 --> 25:37.634
as though he's assaulting
organised religion.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.109
That's a visual cue
that was not in the script

25:40.200 --> 25:42.794
and therefore didn't receive objection.

25:43.600 --> 25:48.196
When Henry and Dr Pretorius
speak about the possible mad plan

25:48.280 --> 25:50.589
to create new female life,

25:50.680 --> 25:55.595
the blasphemous Dr Pretorius
invokes religious iconography

25:55.680 --> 25:59.195
and says "Follow the lead of nature,
or of God..."

25:59.280 --> 26:02.317
It was scripted
"...if you like your fairytales."

26:02.560 --> 26:05.870
Well, this is not how one
speaks about organised religion.

26:05.960 --> 26:09.475
It's changed to "Bible stories",
which is a statement of fact.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.551
<i>Follow the lead of nature,</i>

26:11.680 --> 26:14.240
<i>or of God, if you like your Bible stories.</i>

26:14.320 --> 26:16.311
The way Ernest Thesiger reads the line,

26:16.400 --> 26:19.836
"Bible stories" contains
such invective and disdain

26:19.920 --> 26:23.037
that it's more offensive
than if he'd said "fairytales".

26:23.120 --> 26:27.989
This is how one got around the letter
of the censor and the spirit of intent.

26:28.080 --> 26:33.393
<i>Bride</i> initially had a fairly lengthy subplot
involving the Dwight Frye character.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.953
It was probably a misbegotten script idea

26:37.040 --> 26:39.759
that was meant to illustrate
the monster as victim.

26:39.840 --> 26:44.675
Carl had this uncle and aunt in the film,

26:45.440 --> 26:47.032
who he killed,

26:47.120 --> 26:51.636
and led everybody to believe
that the monster had killed them.

26:51.720 --> 26:56.077
It was probably about a ten-minute
sequence followed by a morgue inquest.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.151
It had no bearing on the narrative line

26:58.240 --> 27:01.710
and probably stopped the film
dead in its tracks at the midpoint.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.075
Whale, probably wisely, removed this,

27:04.160 --> 27:07.436
and that narrative bridge
was filled by a retake,

27:07.520 --> 27:09.829
where the monster is discovered
in the woods,

27:09.920 --> 27:13.595
quite benignly trying to get food
from some Gypsies,

27:13.680 --> 27:15.671
who of course react in abject terror.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.718
This leads us on to the monster
and the hermit sequence.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.509
Every time I watch that scene
with the hermit, the blind man,

27:22.600 --> 27:26.752
I'm struck by how sincerely moving it is.

27:26.840 --> 27:31.231
There is no overtone there
of condescension or ridicule

27:31.320 --> 27:34.915
or making fun of either of those
two characters in that scene,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.595
or of their relationship,
of their need for each other,

27:38.680 --> 27:40.989
and their relief at finding a friend.

27:41.080 --> 27:45.278
It wasn't just "I'm going to
play games with odd humour."

27:45.360 --> 27:47.351
It was sensitivity,

27:47.440 --> 27:56.519
and that sensibility of the warmth
and mutual need that those people find,

27:56.600 --> 27:58.716
that he indulged himself with too.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.439
That wasn't in the first film either.

28:01.520 --> 28:07.197
Those kinds of feelings - both extremes -
weren't in the first film.

28:07.800 --> 28:12.316
Humour has never been so artfully
blended into a horror film as in the <i>Bride.</i>

28:12.400 --> 28:14.470
<i>Very bizarre, this little chap.</i>

28:14.560 --> 28:17.233
<i>There's a certain resemblance to me,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

28:17.320 --> 28:19.038
<i>Or do I flatter myself?</i>

28:19.240 --> 28:25.190
Hindsight tells us that Whale's
sense of humour is sort of camp.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.955
I'm not sure that that's really
quite how it was at the time.

28:29.040 --> 28:33.033
I think the camp and kitschy
elements of his humour

28:33.120 --> 28:36.271
may be something...
a gloss we're putting on it,

28:36.360 --> 28:40.239
some 60 years... 65 years
after the picture was made.

28:40.320 --> 28:45.474
The humour in <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>
permeates much of the story line.

28:46.360 --> 28:50.273
It isn't in comedy-relief segments,

28:50.360 --> 28:54.319
but it is part and parcel
with the characters

28:54.400 --> 28:56.630
and what they do in the main story line.

28:57.440 --> 29:04.391
Pretorius is a comic figure because
of the way he stands outside of life,

29:04.960 --> 29:08.669
of the world, of Henry,
of his own existence,

29:08.760 --> 29:14.676
and comments on it, if only
in the irony of his perspective.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.470
He doesn't take existence seriously.

29:19.600 --> 29:24.720
So he makes comments about
his creations of these little people,

29:24.800 --> 29:29.590
he makes comments about himself
being like the devil or vice versa.

29:30.920 --> 29:35.471
He has an ironic twist to existence,

29:35.560 --> 29:40.793
which is, from what I can tell, something
that he shares - that character shares -

29:40.880 --> 29:43.952
and the actor who played him,
Ernest Thesiger, shared -

29:44.040 --> 29:45.758
with James Whale himself.

29:45.840 --> 29:49.116
Dr Pretorius is firstly
an archetypal old queen.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.590
I think we should fess up about that
right from the beginning.

29:52.680 --> 29:57.549
He is however also Mephistopheles
to Colin Clive

29:57.640 --> 30:00.359
as Frankenstein's... Faust, I think.

30:00.440 --> 30:08.870
He's the one seducing Frankenstein away
from, if I may say, the straight and narrow

30:08.960 --> 30:15.229
back into this very much
more twisted vision

30:15.320 --> 30:17.675
of what he should be doing with his life.

30:17.880 --> 30:21.509
<i>I gather we not only did her hair,</i>

30:22.320 --> 30:24.311
<i>but dressed her.</i>

30:24.960 --> 30:27.315
<i>What a couple of queens we are, Colin.</i>

30:27.400 --> 30:30.278
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>
<i>A couple of flaming queens.</i>

30:30.360 --> 30:35.070
<i>Pretorius is a little bit in love</i>
<i>with Dr Frankenstein, you know.</i>

30:35.800 --> 30:38.792
The gay sensibility responds to outsiders.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.030
<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i> contains several.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.429
Pretorius is an outsider.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.556
Frankenstein becomes an outsider

30:45.640 --> 30:50.111
by being seduced away
from marriage and the home

30:50.200 --> 30:53.272
to becoming the mad scientist again.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.434
And most obviously, most dramatically,
and most poignantly,

30:57.520 --> 30:59.511
the monster is an outsider.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.591
It's very tempting to assume

31:01.680 --> 31:06.754
that Whale identified with an individual
who is an outsider like this,

31:07.680 --> 31:10.513
that the average person
does not understand.

31:11.200 --> 31:16.638
I'm sure James Whale knew what
that felt like when he was a youth,

31:17.600 --> 31:22.116
as an artistically inclined person
in a factory town,

31:22.600 --> 31:24.591
in a factory family.

31:25.520 --> 31:31.356
He knew what that was like probably
well before he knew it as a homosexual.

31:31.440 --> 31:35.991
But it was also the artistry,
being an artist, being a sensitive person,

31:36.080 --> 31:40.232
being somebody who people made fun of,
for whatever reason.

31:40.800 --> 31:44.190
You find that in so many of the characters
in <i>Bride of Frankenstein.</i>

31:44.760 --> 31:48.878
The film also makes a serious comment
on the tensions, sometimes violent,

31:48.960 --> 31:51.713
between society
and the non-conforming individual.

31:51.800 --> 31:59.070
The monster is... the unleashing of the id,
that which must be kept under control,

31:59.160 --> 32:05.474
and when it's unleashed, this is a threat
to stability of society, of human nature.

32:05.560 --> 32:10.395
So somebody must come and
either kill or otherwise tame

32:10.480 --> 32:12.789
that monster that's been unleashed.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.791
And the villagers do that.

32:15.320 --> 32:19.233
The villagers in <i>Frankenstein</i> and in <i>Bride</i>

32:19.320 --> 32:22.437
are almost the villains of the piece.

32:23.760 --> 32:28.231
That's especially the case in the end of
<i>Frankenstein,</i> where they're a lynch mob.

32:28.320 --> 32:33.440
He had the idea that, when people thought
as a group, it could only lead to trouble.

32:33.520 --> 32:39.231
Somehow the mob mentality
was a scarier thing to face

32:39.320 --> 32:41.390
than any monster could possibly be.

32:42.440 --> 32:45.273
With <i>Show Boat,</i>
Whale had nearly achieved his dream

32:45.360 --> 32:47.828
of creative autonomy
and prestige productions.

32:47.920 --> 32:52.835
But Universal was burdened with debt
and in 1936 Carl Laemmle lost his studio.

32:53.440 --> 32:58.514
Whale had this amazing niche for five
years, working under Junior Laemmle.

32:58.600 --> 33:02.434
He almost acted as an independent
filmmaker today. He really had control.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.671
There was nobody -
either a studio person or a producer -

33:05.760 --> 33:07.955
over his shoulder, telling him what to do.

33:08.040 --> 33:11.191
When the Laemmles lost control
over Universal, that was gone.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.158
Whale suddenly found himself
working for people

33:14.240 --> 33:17.118
who were not in sympathy
with his methods at all.

33:17.200 --> 33:22.638
It was much closer to the factory
assembly-line form of filmmaking

33:22.720 --> 33:26.156
that they were doing at MGM
and the other studios.

33:26.240 --> 33:29.277
Whale worked very badly
in those conditions.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.279
Whale's last stand at Universal
was <i>The Road Back,</i>

33:32.360 --> 33:35.591
an uncompromising sequel to
<i>All Quiet on the Western Front.</i>

33:35.680 --> 33:39.116
Under pressure from Germany, the studio
regime severely cut the picture

33:39.200 --> 33:41.236
and it died at the box office.

33:41.320 --> 33:45.598
Whale retired from Hollywood in 1941.
Although financially secure for life,

33:45.680 --> 33:49.514
he did not live to enjoy the critical
acclaim his work finally received.

33:49.600 --> 33:54.276
Disabled and disoriented by a series
of strokes, he took his own life in 1957.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.351
Without Whale's masterful touch,

33:56.440 --> 34:00.035
the later Frankenstein films were
of little interest to their star.

34:00.120 --> 34:03.510
My father played the monster three times.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.239
The third time was <i>Son of Frankenstein,</i>

34:06.320 --> 34:10.279
and at that point he decided
he would not do it again.

34:10.360 --> 34:14.911
He felt that the story line
had been exhausted

34:15.000 --> 34:18.549
and the monster, as he had created him,

34:18.639 --> 34:22.393
had done all that he should
be asked to do.

34:22.480 --> 34:26.712
He was afraid that it would become
the brunt of bad jokes and bad scripts,

34:26.800 --> 34:29.518
and there are those
that would agree with him.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.513
Bill Condon's Academy Award-winning
film <i>Gods and Monsters</i>

34:32.600 --> 34:37.310
featured a reunion between the stars of
<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i> and their director.

34:37.679 --> 34:41.911
<i>Hey, you</i>/ <i>With the camera</i>/
<i>We got a historical moment here.</i>

34:42.000 --> 34:43.752
<i>This is Mr James Whale,</i>

34:43.840 --> 34:47.150
<i>who made "Frankenstein"</i>
<i>and "Bride of Frankenstein".</i>

34:47.239 --> 34:50.118
<i>And this</i> - <i>forget the baby a second</i> - <i>is</i>

34:50.199 --> 34:51.952
<i>the monster</i>

34:52.040 --> 34:54.110
<i>and his bride.</i>

34:54.199 --> 34:56.589
<i>Oh, Karloff. Right</i>/

35:00.680 --> 35:02.989
<i>Don't you just love being famous?</i>

35:03.640 --> 35:08.111
The figure of the bride is so iconic
that she crops up in all kinds of films.

35:08.200 --> 35:13.718
There's this absolutely wonderful <i>Bride of</i>
<i>Frankenstein</i> parody in <i>Small Soldiers.</i>

35:14.680 --> 35:19.276
The <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i> shows up in
the <i>Bride of Chucky</i> in a very clever way.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.598
<i>She's alive</i>/ <i>Alive</i>/

35:24.680 --> 35:26.511
<i>We belong dead.</i>

35:43.680 --> 35:48.595
You can do a little drawing of the bride
and people will say "I know what that is."

35:48.680 --> 35:53.071
I remember building little Aurora kits
of the Bride of Frankenstein

35:53.160 --> 35:56.391
when I was a little kid,
way before I could see the movies,

35:56.480 --> 36:04.512
and being totally enchanted by these
creatures lumbering across my desk

36:04.600 --> 36:06.750
when I went to sleep at night. It felt safe.

36:06.840 --> 36:10.116
Some of these youngsters -
seven, eight, nine years old -

36:10.200 --> 36:13.078
they know the script
backwards and forwards.

36:13.160 --> 36:18.029
Of course, with the advent of video, it
brought it into everybody's living room,

36:18.120 --> 36:20.509
and now on DVD.

36:21.120 --> 36:24.999
It perpetuates the availability,

36:25.080 --> 36:28.516
and the appeal is long-lasting
and multi-generational.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.398
It's a brilliant film, it's a work of genius.

36:31.480 --> 36:35.189
I think it's a picture in which the acting,

36:35.280 --> 36:39.956
particularly the performances of Karloff
and Elsa Lanchester, Ernest Thesiger,

36:40.040 --> 36:43.510
transcend anything you saw being done
in Hollywood at that time.

36:43.600 --> 36:46.160
Brilliant, almost operatic performances.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.198
And if ever somebody
needs to study a film

36:49.280 --> 36:55.276
to see how a director injects
his own personality into a picture,

36:55.760 --> 36:58.194
<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>
is the perfect example.

36:58.280 --> 37:02.353
You can almost watch it and feel like
you spent an evening with James Whale,

37:02.440 --> 37:08.356
listening to his wit, his ideas, and
listening to his remarkable personality.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.075
It's all there in that movie.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.833
It's like an evening with Jimmy.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.949
1935 was an incredible year
for horror movies.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.793
In addition to <i>Bride of Frankenstein,</i>
there was <i>Werewolf of London,</i>

37:20.880 --> 37:24.668
<i>The Raven, Mark of the Vampire</i> and
<i>Mad Love.</i> All these are classics,

37:24.760 --> 37:28.389
but, almost 70 years later, <i>Bride of</i>
<i>Frankenstein</i> towers above them.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.552
As a follow-up, James Whale was
scheduled to direct <i>Dracula's Daughter</i>

37:31.640 --> 37:35.758
as a baroque black comedy even more
outrageous than <i>Bride of Frankenstein.</i>

37:35.840 --> 37:38.308
But the script was too much
for the censors.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.960
We missed the daughter,
but we still have the bride,

37:41.040 --> 37:43.031
and that's something to be grateful for.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.473
I'm Joe Dante.
