22:37.941 --> 22:40.568

Hallelujah.

22:41.945 --> 22:44.072
Sexting, bro.

22:41.945 --> 22:44.072
Get used to it.

22:44.114 --> 22:46.449
Oh, my God.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.743
Is it weird that I'm really

22:46.490 --> 22:48.743
turned on right now?

[instrumental music]

23:09.680 --> 23:12.142
What are we doing here?

23:12.183 --> 23:13.684
I wanna see your school.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.869
Hey, Steve.

23:34.331 --> 23:36.749
Hey. Henry.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.335
What are you guys up to?

23:38.376 --> 23:40.086
Henry wanted to see Woodland.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.963
Ah, well, it's not quite MIT.

23:43.006 --> 23:45.342
Seems pretty cool to me.

23:45.383 --> 23:46.968
Uh, well, you are welcome

23:45.383 --> 23:46.968
to check out the campus

23:47.010 --> 23:48.845
most of the buildings

23:47.010 --> 23:48.845
are closed right now.

23:48.886 --> 23:51.639
But, uh, you should stop

23:48.886 --> 23:51.639
by during the day.

23:51.681 --> 23:52.807
Have fun.

23:54.309 --> 23:57.478
Admit it. You are jealous.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.729
What do you mean?

23:58.771 --> 24:01.358
Jealous of my community college.

24:01.399 --> 24:02.859
Don't do that.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.278
Don't put it down.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.988
Everybody talks about this place

24:05.320 --> 24:06.988
like it's some kinda

24:07.030 --> 24:08.156
consolation prize.

24:08.198 --> 24:10.574
But that's bullshit. I mean...

24:10.616 --> 24:12.702
It's a college,

24:10.616 --> 24:12.702
just like any other.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.578
You'll get out of it

24:12.743 --> 24:14.578
what you put into it.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.333
It's kinda sweet you stickin' up

24:16.455 --> 24:18.333
for my school.

24:18.375 --> 24:21.294
[music continues]

24:37.810 --> 24:40.313
Look at these desks.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.313
What is this? Oak?

24:40.355 --> 24:42.690
I don't even think

24:40.355 --> 24:42.690
that a wood.

24:42.732 --> 24:44.359
Oh, and look white boards.

24:44.401 --> 24:45.943
Harvard's still using chalk.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.613
Speech. Speech.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.492
Your graduation speech.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.161
You already heard

24:53.534 --> 24:55.161
my graduation speech.

24:55.203 --> 24:58.122

Oh, why not?

25:11.428 --> 25:14.972
[Henry]

25:11.428 --> 25:14.972
It was all this

25:11.428 --> 25:14.972
cynical stuff about...

25:15.014 --> 25:18.142
how we're essentially

25:15.014 --> 25:18.142
a freak accident of the cosmos

25:18.184 --> 25:20.603
and life is random

25:18.184 --> 25:20.603

Well, um...

27:57.510 --> 27:59.845
That night that I, um...

27:59.887 --> 28:01.347
picked you up...

28:01.389 --> 28:02.348

talk to you again

28:17.655 --> 28:20.283

28:20.324 --> 28:22.701
drive-by and help you fix it.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.663
But then you took off too fast,

39:16.730 --> 39:18.274
really paying attention.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.111
Then I heard

39:19.983 --> 39:22.111
this girl screaming.

39:24.196 --> 39:26.240
He was just face down

39:24.196 --> 39:26.240

39:29.243 --> 39:31.578
I pulled him out,

39:29.243 --> 39:31.578
I tried to do CPR.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.122
But I probably wasn't

39:31.620 --> 39:33.122

39:56.979 --> 39:58.647
Reggie's dad's a cop.

40:00.482 --> 40:02.151
And they don't think

40:00.482 --> 40:02.151

40:13.829 --> 40:15.247
Oh, God!

40:15.289 --> 40:18.458
First, Audrey and now this.

40:15.289 --> 40:18.458
It's horrible.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.920
My God, the parents,

40:24.881 --> 40:26.633
I'm still here, mom.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.848
You dated Bailey

40:30.595 --> 40:32.848
for a little bit, right?

40:32.889 --> 40:33.974
[chuckles]

40:34.016 --> 40:36.518
Sort of, I guess.

40:36.559 --> 40:40.522
He can come across cocky

40:36.559 --> 40:40.522
but he was really funny.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.274
He could be sweet.

40:52.284 --> 40:55.329
Or, um, see a movie?

40:55.371 --> 40:58.081
Just somethin' to take your mind

40:55.371 --> 40:58.081

I think people are

40:58.123 --> 40:59.958

That's sweet,

42:39.057 --> 42:42.102
but Sam's a free spirit.

42:42.144 --> 42:43.270
If you know what I mean.

42:45.021 --> 42:46.440

42:47.816 --> 42:50.735
No. Why would they talk to me?

'Cause sometimes

42:59.577 --> 43:01.913
I walk on the beach.

43:01.955 --> 43:03.581
But I wasn't at the party.

43:03.623 --> 43:05.375
So, it could've been you.

43:07.544 --> 43:09.338
He was killed, I mean.

43:09.379 --> 43:12.090

01:04:44.256 --> 01:04:46.925
-No one, Sam.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.554
My wingman is dead.

01:04:50.596 --> 01:04:52.973
You know, we used to smash

01:04:50.596 --> 01:04:52.973
into each other on these swings

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:54.642
when we were little kids?

01:04:54.683 --> 01:04:56.477
You shouldn't be alone, Dustin.

01:04:56.518 --> 01:05:00.230
Come on. I'm not scared of the

01:04:56.518 --> 01:05:00.230
stupid fuckin' beach-killer.

01:05:00.272 --> 01:05:01.857
I wish he was out here.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.233
[Sam]

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.233
That's not what I mean.

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.862
Do you hear me?

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.448
I'm ready for you,

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.448
motherfucker. Let's go.

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:12.326

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.747
[Sam]

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.747
Okay, alright,

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.747
I'm gonna come out.

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:18.540
[Dustin]

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:18.540
Are you sure?

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:19.958
[Sam]

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:19.958
Y-yeah, don't go anywhere.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.419
You, you should not be driving

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.419
right now.

01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:23.879
[Dustin]

01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:23.879
Thanks, Sam. Uh...

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.090
I won't even try

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.090
to get in your pants.

01:05:28.175 --> 01:05:30.218

Oh, shit, dude,

01:05:55.202 --> 01:05:56.745
that's not cool.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:00.957
Is Sam with you?

01:06:02.918 --> 01:06:04.879
She's meeting us here.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.963
Are you disappointed?

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:08.465
What?

01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:10.425
Did you want her

01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:10.425
all to yourself?

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.177
I mean...

01:06:12.219 --> 01:06:13.428
I get it.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:16.097
Dude, I'm not doing this

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:16.097
right now.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:17.432
Doing what?

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.768
[sighs]

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.768
This weird jealousy thing, dude.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.061
I honestly couldn't give a fuck.

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:23.355
Look, man.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.692
I'm sorry about Bailey.

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:29.319
I mean it.

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.075
Uh, none of this shit matters.

[Sam]

01:07:52.945 --> 01:07:55.280
I could see him in the woods...

01:07:55.322 --> 01:07:56.865
watching me.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:01.745
I'm sorry, Sam.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.414
So sorry.

01:08:07.626 --> 01:08:09.044
Thank you for coming, Henry.

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:13.423
Cleo told me about the bruise.

01:08:14.967 --> 01:08:16.510
-Let me see it.

01:08:14.967 --> 01:08:16.510
-No.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.428
It's fine.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.428
It was an accident.

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:19.888
I got in the way.

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:23.975
That's not like you, Sam.

01:08:24.018 --> 01:08:25.310
You don't take the blame

01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:27.062
for the crap

01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:27.062
that other people do.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:33.777
I've done...

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.031
so many stupid things.

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:41.158
I just kinda lost it.

01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:42.953
All 'cause

01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:42.953
I was afraid of losing you.

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:45.997
It's okay.

01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:50.085
-It is?

01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:50.085
-Yeah.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.629
[sighs]

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.174
That's great, Sam.

[Mrs. Maddox]

01:09:02.389 --> 01:09:04.307
Henry reminds me

01:09:02.389 --> 01:09:04.307
of your father.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.435
[Sam]

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.435
Really?

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:09.938
So smart.

01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:13.274
So passionate, alive...

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.986
[music continues]

01:09:16.028 --> 01:09:19.031
When someone like that

01:09:16.028 --> 01:09:19.031
focuses all that energy on you

01:09:19.073 --> 01:09:20.615
it can be electric.

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:27.205
But, there's a dark side

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:27.205
to that intensity.

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:29.165
And I think

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.542
Henry has

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.542
a destructive nature.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.921
Like your dad.

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:39.801
I know you're hurting.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.678
But if you decide

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.678
to stay with him

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.638
you're gonna be

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.638
in a lot more pain.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:49.227
Henry.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.479
I really need...

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:55.109
a friend right now.

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:56.902
Okay? Nothing more.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.299
You have no idea

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.592
of the things

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.592
that I've done for you.

01:10:21.927 --> 01:10:23.011
[Henry]

01:10:21.927 --> 01:10:23.011
No idea.

I didn't hear from you

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:45.951
for five days.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:51.456
It was the longest I had gone

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:51.456
without hearing your voice

01:10:51.498 --> 01:10:54.042
[sniffles]

01:10:51.498 --> 01:10:54.042
since that first day

01:10:51.498 --> 01:10:54.042
on the beach.

01:10:56.962 --> 01:10:59.089
When I got your call...

01:10:59.131 --> 01:11:00.548
- Hi.

01:10:59.131 --> 01:11:00.548
- Hey.

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:06.262
It surprised me

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:06.262
how excited I was.

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:08.223
[Henry]

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:08.223
I-I have sort of a proposal.

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:11.768
Will you come over

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:11.768
for dinner?

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:13.728
I'm gonna try

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:13.728
one of my mom's recipes.

01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:16.231
Oh.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:19.275
[Henry]

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:19.275
Oh, it's kind of

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:19.275
a celebration.

01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:21.695
I worked things out with MIT.

01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:23.113
Really?

01:11:23.155 --> 01:11:24.739
Henry, that's great.

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.992
Oh, my God,

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.992
that's so good to hear.

01:11:27.034 --> 01:11:28.785
So you'll come?

[music continues]

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:35.125
Is your mom home?

01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:37.627
She'll be back later.

Wow.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:59.983
It's the one thing my mom's

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:59.983
relaxed about.

01:12:00.025 --> 01:12:02.069
She's half-French, so...

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:03.319
You know how they are.

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:04.946

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:04.946
Thanks.

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:08.867
-To MIT.

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:08.867
-And to Woodland.

[Sam chuckles]

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.331
It's good.

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:16.917
Have a seat.

It seems like we were

01:12:31.223 --> 01:12:33.975
just arguing on the beach.

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:35.894
You telling me my speech sucked.

[clicks tongue]

01:12:35.936 --> 01:12:37.854
Not my exact words.

01:12:37.896 --> 01:12:39.022
But yeah.

It's been

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.943
a pretty messed up summer.

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:47.322
But not all of it.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:49.866
Not all of it.

01:12:56.748 --> 01:12:58.917
I don't have...

01:12:58.959 --> 01:13:00.835
any excuses for my behavior

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.003
other than...

01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:05.673
I love you.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.425
I lost sight of everything else

01:13:07.467 --> 01:13:10.929
but, my intentions

01:13:07.467 --> 01:13:10.929
were always good.

01:13:10.971 --> 01:13:13.556
And yes, I know what they say

01:13:10.971 --> 01:13:13.556
about good intentions.

01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:15.475

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:17.227
You don't have to say anything.

01:13:17.269 --> 01:13:18.270
I actually

01:13:17.269 --> 01:13:18.270
mailed you something

01:13:18.312 --> 01:13:19.938
that should explain things.

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.898
But right now, I need to check

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.898
on my appetizers.

Mm.

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:44.838
This is good.

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:47.048
How come I didn't know

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:47.048
you could cook?

Oh!

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:04.732
got the hot one.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:05.900
Are you alright?
