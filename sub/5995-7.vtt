WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:04.405
Look, I get it,
Greg is your Jacob,

00:04.438 --> 00:06.274
but we all know you're going
to end up with Edward.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.609
Because you're Bella.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.144
What is that reference?

00:10.178 --> 00:11.212
It's on the tip of my tongue.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.147
It's...
(gasps) Twilight.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.282
Twilight, yes.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.783
It's only
the greatest love story

00:15.816 --> 00:18.319
since Shakespeare... in Love.
Right.
Yeah.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.687
Right, yeah, okay.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.089
What are you talking about
again?

00:21.122 --> 00:23.091
You spent Thanksgiving
with Greg,

00:23.124 --> 00:25.059
and that was not
part of our plan.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.360
You need to be with Josh.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.696
If not for you, then for me.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.698
Why?
I need this.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.401
My marriage is like
 The Walking Dead, okay?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.203
We are all just trying
to get out alive.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.770
You and Josh,

00:36.804 --> 00:38.306
your love story...

00:38.339 --> 00:39.507
it gives me hope.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.409
What love story?

00:41.442 --> 00:44.245
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

00:44.278 --> 00:46.080
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

00:46.114 --> 00:47.548
* One day I was crying a lot

00:47.581 --> 00:48.782
* And so I decided to move

00:48.816 --> 00:50.484
* To West Covina, California

00:50.518 --> 00:51.785
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

00:51.819 --> 00:54.222
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

00:54.255 --> 00:56.690
* But that's not why I'm here

00:56.724 --> 00:58.726
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.461
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:00.494 --> 01:01.729
That's a sexist term.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.297
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:03.331 --> 01:04.098
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

01:04.132 --> 01:07.135
* She's so broken inside *

01:07.168 --> 01:08.436
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.438
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

01:10.471 --> 01:11.872
Okay! We get it!

01:11.905 --> 01:13.741
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

01:13.774 --> 01:15.276
(phone chimes)

01:15.309 --> 01:17.311
Oh, is that Greg again?
Look at that.

01:17.345 --> 01:18.579
He has texted you
six times already today.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.881
Yeah, because he is my friend.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.250
We're friends.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.452
We're gonna go to a movie
as friends.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.619
It's like he's a stalker.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.555
Okay? No one likes a stalker.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.656
Oh.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.491
The eagle and
the bitch have landed.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.492
REBECCA:
Really? Let me see.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.295
Let me see.
Let me see.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.765
Um, Joshy, do you need,
um, glasses?

01:37.798 --> 01:39.567
Because the door is
right over there.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.402
(grunting)
Oh. My bad, babe.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.337
Okay, well...

01:43.371 --> 01:45.406
I hope they like
the rice cooker I got them.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.640
Everyone likes rice, right?

01:46.674 --> 01:47.775
It's a very versatile grain.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.677
What? Are you crazy?

01:49.710 --> 01:51.212
You don't want them snuggling up

01:51.245 --> 01:53.347
over the one dish
that connects their cultures.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.782
I'm gonna go give them
this gift.
Okay.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.417
I'll be right
back, okay?
Forget the gift.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.451
Forget about the gift.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.486
I am just trying to snap you

01:58.519 --> 01:59.687
back into reality,

01:59.720 --> 02:01.522
because now that Josh and
Valencia are living together,

02:01.555 --> 02:04.325
you are not gonna have any more
alone time with him.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.360
Well, you know what?

02:07.561 --> 02:09.562
I just want him
to be happy.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.267
Ooh!
(laughs)

02:13.301 --> 02:14.502
Oh, my gosh, Joshy,

02:14.535 --> 02:16.637
I'm so glad we finally
moved in together.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.506
It's the beginning
of our happily ever after.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.509
Yes, it's cool.
Plus, we'll be close to...
Marriage? Kids?

02:21.542 --> 02:23.244
I was going
to say Taco Bell.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.612
There's only one thing missing.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.247
The salsa?
You just ask for it.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.848
No, furniture, Joshy.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.418
I mean, we don't even have
a dining room table.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.385
But we'll get one.

02:31.419 --> 02:34.222
Let's burn sage.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.424
Shoot, I forgot
to get that.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.226
Joshy, I needed that sage

02:38.259 --> 02:39.793
to cleanse the house
of evil spirits.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.429
Ghosts are obsessed with me.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.964
I'll get it right now.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.334
I love you.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.236
PAULA:
Ugh, I hate her.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.271
She's worse than all
the Kardashians combined.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.806
Except for Caitlyn,
who is a national hero.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.974
I'm just gonna call Josh

02:54.007 --> 02:56.244
and see if it's cool
that I come over.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.745
Do you need me to call Valencia
from a burner phone

02:57.778 --> 02:59.447
and tell her there's been
a murder at the yoga studio

02:59.480 --> 03:01.515
so you and Josh
can have more alone time?

03:01.549 --> 03:03.517
You came up with that
way too quickly.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.288
(Rebecca exhales)

03:07.321 --> 03:09.890
(phone ringing)

03:09.923 --> 03:13.227
Oh, he pressed
"ignore."

03:13.261 --> 03:15.863
Oh... oh...
that doesn't feel good.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.533
It's fine,
it's fine.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.901
He's busy.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.570
I get it, I'm busy, too!

03:22.603 --> 03:25.339
I won't even think about it.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.813
(elevator bell dings)
I don't want to feel this way.

03:32.846 --> 03:33.981
I reject this feeling.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.284
I respectfully decline
this feeling.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.818
Hey, here she is!

03:37.851 --> 03:38.652
Here's my MVP.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.488
You ready to kick butt
at that meeting?

03:40.521 --> 03:41.822
Huh?
(laughs nervously)

03:41.855 --> 03:44.292
Calvin Young is
the most important

03:44.325 --> 03:46.560
potential client
we have ever had.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.461
I'm joking.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.562
(laughing)

03:48.596 --> 03:49.497
I mean, he is.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.031
I mean,
landing him

03:51.064 --> 03:52.900
would make us West Covina's
premiere law firm.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.636
But I know, by the time
you knock his socks off today,

03:55.669 --> 03:56.937
wine and dine him
over the weekend

03:56.970 --> 03:58.706
and then do your
presentation on Monday,

03:58.739 --> 04:01.008
he will be...

04:03.043 --> 04:04.612
Putty in our hands.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.646
Oh.
Are you okay?

04:05.679 --> 04:07.748
I mean,
you look a little peaked.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.783
Never felt better. Uh-huh.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.653
I definitely won't
press ignore...

04:12.686 --> 04:14.655
on this case.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.557
Okay.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.024
What?

04:18.058 --> 04:21.595
"Mr. Young, I know that you have
your choice of law firms

04:21.629 --> 04:23.464
"to represent you in this matter

04:23.497 --> 04:24.498
"of Josh moving
into a new apartment

04:24.532 --> 04:26.500
with his hot girlfriend..."
No! I typed that?

04:28.536 --> 04:29.737
(whimpers)

04:29.770 --> 04:31.572
(breathing deeply)

04:31.605 --> 04:32.573
(inhales sharply)

04:32.606 --> 04:33.574
Oh...

04:33.607 --> 04:36.009
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.045
(panting)

04:45.819 --> 04:47.655
Well, then, why do I have you
in the office?

04:47.688 --> 04:49.523
Huh? Gotcha there, bottle.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.372
Oh...

05:04.405 --> 05:06.407
ANNOUNCER:
And here's a health messages
from TV's favorite doctor.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.343
Do you know the signs
and symptoms of the dreaded

05:09.377 --> 05:10.878
panic attack?

05:10.911 --> 05:13.714
Well, if you don't,
you need to join me

05:13.747 --> 05:15.048
for my week long marathon

05:15.082 --> 05:16.784
where I'm gonna teach you

05:16.817 --> 05:18.519
how to identify the symptoms,

05:18.552 --> 05:20.821
such as shortness of breath...

05:20.854 --> 05:22.756
(breathing shallowly)

05:22.790 --> 05:24.458
...heart palpitations,

05:24.492 --> 05:26.494
the urge to self-medicate

05:26.527 --> 05:27.695
with drugs and booze.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.064
KAREN:
He's here!

05:31.098 --> 05:32.966
Whole firm is counting on you.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.702
Okay, I'm coming.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.737
(elevator bell dings)
*

05:47.815 --> 05:51.719
Scott, I am asking you
to drive carpool for one day.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.687
I do it every day.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.524
Oh... fine.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.926
Fine, okay, whatever,
I gotta go.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.628
(sighs)

06:00.661 --> 06:03.731
It's nice to...
feel appreciated.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.700
Mmm.

06:06.734 --> 06:10.003
Your perfume is delightful.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.705
Thank you.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.475
I rubbed a magazine on myself
this morning.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.976
Well, it smells like a cherub

06:16.009 --> 06:17.745
dancing in the morning dew.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.481
Oh.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.582
I'm Calvin Young.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.583
Ah!

06:22.616 --> 06:23.584
Paula Proctor.

06:23.617 --> 06:24.718
Welcome to Whitefeather.

06:24.752 --> 06:25.719
(chuckles)

06:25.753 --> 06:28.188
Are we, by chance,
going to the same meeting?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.590
Yes.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.658
Follow me.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.094
Calvin Young.
Nice to meet you.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.829
Hi, Karen, the case assistant.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.164
Please excuse my handshake.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.832
I have naturally damp hands.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.734
It's a medical condition.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.836
I am in some studies.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.037
Shall we be seated?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.075
(clears throat)
You okay?

06:48.108 --> 06:49.577
Mm? Mm.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.946
May I get you some
coffee, Mr. Young?
Yes.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.615
Uh, French press,
if you have it.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.217
French press.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.686
Mr. Young,
we are so excited

06:58.719 --> 06:59.620
to have this opportunity

06:59.653 --> 07:01.689
to bring you into
the Whitefeather family.

07:01.722 --> 07:02.490
'Cause that's what we are.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.825
A family that can
help you acquire

07:04.858 --> 07:05.993
the industrial acreage
you're looking for.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.562
Well, I am pleased
to be here, Darryl.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.997
DARRYL:
Well, we are determined
to show you

07:10.030 --> 07:11.465
everything that
we're capable of.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.833
(distantly):
And to do that...

07:12.866 --> 07:14.702
I can think of no one else

07:14.735 --> 07:16.770
but our closer.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.872
(normal voice):
Um, why don't you
take it away, there, Rebecca?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.678
Rebecca?
Hmm?

07:24.712 --> 07:26.680
(whispering):
Would you please take it away?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.824
(clears throat)

07:36.857 --> 07:38.592
Welcome, Calvin.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.728
Oh, my God,
your teeth are blue.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.064
Have you been drinking
the water from the toilet?

07:44.097 --> 07:46.066
Oh, crap.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.868
It's ink. Must've been
from my pen cup.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.671
(laughs apologetically)

07:50.704 --> 07:51.805
(clears throat)

07:51.839 --> 07:53.541
(laughs nervously)

07:53.574 --> 07:55.008
Okay.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.210
Welcome... to Joshfeather.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.211
DARRYL:
Oh...

07:58.245 --> 07:59.747
White... feather.

08:00.781 --> 08:01.815
Oh, God.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.756
What happened
to you in there?

08:08.789 --> 08:10.223
That's not
the Rebecca I know.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.592
I mean, something is wrong.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.960
Karen said that
she smells vodka on you.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.228
Well, that's ridiculous.
Vodka doesn't smell.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.798
Listen, Darryl, I know
I didn't bring my "A" game...

08:17.831 --> 08:19.266
I think you need to go home.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.968
Wait, are you taking me
off the case?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.970
Please don't take
me off the case,

08:23.003 --> 08:24.638
because if you take me
off the case,

08:24.672 --> 08:25.873
that means I'm not working
and if I'm not working,

08:25.906 --> 08:27.140
that means I have
to think thoughts.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.809
Okay, you're not off the case.
(exhales)

08:28.842 --> 08:30.978
But go home and work
on the presentation.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.145
And then, when you
come back on Monday,

08:33.179 --> 08:34.847
I want you to be
the happy Rebecca

08:34.881 --> 08:35.883
that we all know
and love.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.985
Such a good tip.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.986
So helpful.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.688
"Be happy."

08:41.722 --> 08:43.724
*

08:46.960 --> 08:48.962
(phone ringing)

08:52.600 --> 08:53.667
Hi, Paula.

08:53.701 --> 08:54.968
Hey, are you okay?

08:55.002 --> 08:56.937
I got back
with Calvin's fancy coffee

08:56.970 --> 08:58.739
and Darryl said you weren't
feeling well and you went home.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.174
Yeah. Yeah, my blood sugar
was a little low,

09:01.208 --> 09:03.243
so I decided to just come home

09:03.276 --> 09:06.246
and really focus on
the presentation all weekend.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.048
Hey, are you sure you're cool

09:08.081 --> 09:09.817
to do the Calvin dinner
without me?

09:09.850 --> 09:12.720
Well, I'll do my best.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.287
Okay.
Uh, I gotta hop off.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.856
I'm really working hard here.
Bye!

09:23.163 --> 09:25.132
(turns on TV)

09:25.165 --> 09:28.869
It's important to deal
with one's feelings head-on,

09:28.902 --> 09:31.772
because repressed feelings
lead to depression.

09:31.805 --> 09:32.906
What do you know?

09:32.940 --> 09:35.609
Repression equals depression.

09:35.643 --> 09:36.076
That is...

09:38.812 --> 09:40.814
(French music playing)

09:43.250 --> 09:45.285
I'm tired, too.

09:49.156 --> 09:52.192
I'm depressed, too.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.261
Man...

09:54.294 --> 09:56.964
the French really know how
to make depression look sexy.

10:02.269 --> 10:07.007
(French accent):
* My eyes are dark
from sadness *

10:07.040 --> 10:11.144
* My lips are red from pain

10:11.178 --> 10:15.849
* My bosom heaves with sobs

10:15.883 --> 10:20.921
* I'm in a sexy
French depression *

10:20.954 --> 10:25.893
* I walk oh so slowly

10:25.926 --> 10:29.229
* I can only breathe and sigh

10:29.262 --> 10:31.164
(sighs)

10:31.198 --> 10:34.902
* My bed smells like a tampon

10:34.935 --> 10:39.873
* I'm in a sexy
French depression *

10:39.907 --> 10:41.909
(singing in French)

11:05.365 --> 11:07.801
Ooh, chocolat.

11:07.835 --> 11:11.939
* I black out
with dessert wine *

11:13.106 --> 11:14.742
Oui.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.944
Je suis garbage.

11:16.977 --> 11:22.249
* This grout needs
to be redone *

11:22.282 --> 11:26.954
* I'm in a sexy
French depression *

11:29.156 --> 11:31.158
(speaking French)

11:44.537 --> 11:47.775
* I'm in a sexy

11:47.808 --> 11:51.945
* French

11:51.979 --> 11:56.249
* Depression.

12:05.993 --> 12:09.930
There is nothing sexy
about depression, Rebecca.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.965
Listen, you better get
your act together,

12:11.999 --> 12:14.067
young lady, or you're gonna
run this new life

12:14.101 --> 12:15.936
off in the ditch.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.905
How did you get in here?

12:17.938 --> 12:20.340
Well, your depressed mind
invited me in.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.010
And by the way,
this place is a dump.

12:23.043 --> 12:26.346
You ever think about maybe
hanging a little art in here

12:26.379 --> 12:28.348
or something, anything?

12:28.381 --> 12:29.382
Maybe a mural?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.088
I don't know about this.

12:35.122 --> 12:38.191
Are you sure this is
the dining table she wants?

12:38.225 --> 12:39.492
I don't know.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.128
I want to
surprise her.
Surprise her?

12:41.161 --> 12:43.063
With furniture?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.832
She's very picky, dude.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.066
Yeah, yesterday
you got in trouble

12:46.099 --> 12:48.101
because you bought
the wrong kind of sage.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.036
You bought the kind
you put in food,

12:49.069 --> 12:52.405
not the kind you scare
ghosts away with.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.307
Valencia's
intense, bro.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.043
As sexy as she is,
she's intense.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.511
She has final approval
over all your clothing.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.413
Yeah, you know... yes.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.816
I really miss your cargos.
We all do.

13:02.850 --> 13:06.019
Guys, I'm committed
to this relationship.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.087
I want to contribute.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.221
You know?
She's done everything.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.589
She picked out the apartment,

13:09.622 --> 13:11.058
she booked the moving trucks.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.326
We're supposed
to be a team

13:13.360 --> 13:15.062
and I want to do something
for her.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.496
So we gonna do this or what?

13:16.529 --> 13:18.565
Yes. Yes, we are
going to do this.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.000
Guys, we can bang this out.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.169
According to this,
it is a very simple

13:22.202 --> 13:24.905
72-step process.
72-step process.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.206
Oh, hell no.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.540
Okay.
We're not doing that.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.576
We lost Hector.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.581
DR. PHIL:
What are you looking for?

13:34.614 --> 13:36.049
Oh, my God,
you're still here.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.184
Tell it to me straight.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.852
Am I schizophrenic?

13:38.886 --> 13:40.220
I'm not really here.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.588
I'm just in your imagination.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.523
(exhales)
I mean,
let's face it:

13:43.556 --> 13:46.359
you do have a very
active imagination.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.561
One minute,
you're walking down the street,

13:48.595 --> 13:50.230
the next minute,
you're in a big musical.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.365
Although,
I gotta say,

13:52.399 --> 13:54.234
I did love the pretzel.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.168
You did a good
job on that one.

13:55.202 --> 13:58.105
Yes! Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.306
Aw, it's a shoelace tip.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.874
Ugh, that's gross.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.142
Oh, my God, you're looking

14:02.175 --> 14:04.211
for prescription meds
in a drawer?

14:04.244 --> 14:07.080
So? Listen, when I moved here,
I thought I was okay,

14:07.114 --> 14:08.916
so I dumped them all my meds
and now, you know,

14:08.949 --> 14:10.150
I realize that I'm not okay.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.418
I mean, look at me,
I'm falling apart here.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.986
This is
really bad.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.188
So if I can just get
my old prescription meds back,

14:15.222 --> 14:16.323
I'll be okay.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.590
Uh, here's
a thought.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.459
Anxiety, depression...

14:19.492 --> 14:22.195
how about you see
a doctor first?

14:22.229 --> 14:23.563
I'll go do that.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.132
Ten steps ahead of you.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.502
Thank you so much for seeing me
on such short notice,

14:29.536 --> 14:31.238
Dr. Akopian.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.173
What can I help you with?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.408
Yeah...

14:35.442 --> 14:37.377
I'm not myself right now.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.379
We're always ourselves, Rebecca.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.649
Right. Yeah.

14:42.682 --> 14:46.286
No, so I don't feel
like myself.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.156
This isn't usually how I am.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.291
Like, I'm normally
very organized and focused.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.893
Sounds like
you're feeling out of control.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.397
Let's delve into your childhood.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.033
Oh, I was afraid you'd say that.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.103
Okay, so, I've been through
the therapy wringer,

15:03.136 --> 15:05.072
I've rehashed
my childhood a ton.

15:05.105 --> 15:08.175
and I don't really want
to do it again.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.277
Like, for me and for you,
frankly,

15:10.310 --> 15:11.979
I don't want to put that on you.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.147
So here's what I need.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.149
I need these.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.151
Those are the meds
I was on in New York.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.419
Oh, my God.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.188
How did your
body react

15:21.221 --> 15:22.155
to all this medication?

15:22.189 --> 15:23.723
You must not have been able
to feel a thing.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.026
Exactly. Numb as they come.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.628
So... scribble scribble
on your pizzle pad.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.663
Rebecca, your doctor
in New York is a quack.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.565
He gave you a Band-Aid,
not a cure.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.634
My method would be
to do some digging

15:34.667 --> 15:37.337
and figure out what's really
going on inside your mind.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.606
And then we can discuss
the appropriate medications.

15:39.639 --> 15:40.707
So that's great,

15:40.740 --> 15:43.243
but I need to be better
by Monday.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.213
It's a work thing, so...

15:46.246 --> 15:48.048
We doing this?

15:48.081 --> 15:50.117
No, we're not.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.052
Okay.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.686
Okay, well, you know what?

15:53.720 --> 15:55.255
You'll be hearing
from me on Yelp.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.560
Um, where is your rest room?

16:01.794 --> 16:04.064
*

16:23.416 --> 16:26.153
DARRYL:
 Say, what time
 is your husband joining us?

16:26.186 --> 16:27.320
Oh, Scott?

16:27.354 --> 16:28.455
He bailed at the last minute.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.457
He has rehearsal
for his singing group.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.359
And that's more
important than this?

16:32.392 --> 16:33.626
I don't mind.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.062
I'm fine.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.763
He does what he wants to do,
I don't care.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.531
I do what I want to do,
he doesn't care.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.300
It's basically
the storybook romance

16:40.333 --> 16:41.701
I dreamed of as a little girl.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.337
Aw, you see?
You guys get each other.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.705
That's so cool.
(doorbell rings)

16:47.407 --> 16:48.375
How are my eyebrows?

16:48.408 --> 16:50.277
Don't care.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.145
They can be wonky.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.181
(inhales)

16:55.515 --> 16:57.250
Few people know this,

16:57.284 --> 16:59.486
but bald eagles
aren't bald at all.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.820
You see, the name

17:00.853 --> 17:02.255
actually derives
from a word

17:02.289 --> 17:03.556
meaning
"white headed."

17:03.590 --> 17:04.757
And being a "white feather,"

17:04.790 --> 17:06.358
well, I've always felt

17:06.393 --> 17:08.428
very connected
to our national bird.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.429
Actually, it's
my spirit animal.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.098
May I just say

17:11.131 --> 17:14.233
this is an adorable red?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.335
(both laugh)

17:15.367 --> 17:17.436
Unconventionally alluring,

17:17.470 --> 17:19.705
with the soul of a poet.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.407
Thank you.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.310
I got it at
the gas station,

17:23.343 --> 17:25.311
but in the ten-dollar bin.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.280
In the future,
you really should try

17:27.314 --> 17:29.616
some of the Arizona wines.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.519
Blend those with
a smooth Camembert...

17:32.552 --> 17:34.354
Mmm! Heaven.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.356
Oh, I am imagining that.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.326
Mmm... Camembert.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.660
It's fun to say.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.829
Oh, you know what?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.197
Let's play a game.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.498
Oh!
Yeah.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.866
You tell me
everything about you,

17:46.899 --> 17:49.469
don't skip a thing, go.
DARRYL:
Okay.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.303
I was born in Irvine,
California.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.672
Um, my favorite color
is green...

17:52.705 --> 17:53.606
Not you.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.341
Oh.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.143
Ladies first.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.744
Of course. I'm sorry.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.346
You know what?
Calvin, you're the guest,

17:59.379 --> 18:01.214
so you should go first.
Go ahead.

18:01.248 --> 18:04.417
Okay, well, um,
I was born in Prescott,

18:04.451 --> 18:06.553
but I knew a small town
wasn't for me,

18:06.586 --> 18:08.221
so I moved to the big city.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.289
Phoenix?
Tucson.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.290
Right.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.758
Yeah, and I, uh,

18:11.791 --> 18:13.326
met my lovely wife.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.129
Ten years of bliss...

18:16.163 --> 18:17.464
and then she died.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.132
No!

18:19.166 --> 18:21.468
(clears throat)

18:21.501 --> 18:25.138
It was a, uh, short
and tragic illness.

18:27.374 --> 18:30.310
(choked up):
The last thing she said was...

18:30.343 --> 18:31.444
"Calvin,

18:31.478 --> 18:34.547
"be happy.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.649
"Take life and...

18:36.683 --> 18:38.185
and grab it."

18:38.218 --> 18:40.187
And you should.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.822
You should take
whatever you want.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.691
Just take and grab.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.493
Hmm.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.397
I'm gonna roll.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.664
Okay.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.400
Okay, let's see...

18:53.433 --> 18:56.703
pink pill with
the number 55 on it...

18:58.638 --> 19:00.840
Yes! ADD medication.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.275
I've always wanted to take this.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.376
Wait a minute.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.345
What?

19:05.378 --> 19:07.414
Do-do I really need to tell you

19:07.447 --> 19:10.817
don't take a pill you found
on the bathroom floor

19:10.850 --> 19:12.352
next to the toilet?

19:12.385 --> 19:13.486
Here me out, Dr. Phil.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.423
It improves focus and promotes
goal-directed behavior.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.492
That's exactly the mojo
that I need.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.628
Rebecca, I know what it says,

19:21.661 --> 19:23.330
and I know what you need.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.365
You need
to focus on this:

19:25.398 --> 19:28.635
Josh could find you
if he wanted to.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.438
You have made yourself
really easy to find.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.473
You have been
rejected.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.842
Rejected.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.677
He doesn't want you.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.812
That's reality. Deal with it.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.650
No. I'm not gonna listen to you.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.917
You talk silly.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.953
Oh, my God.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.622
Oh, what's that, little pill?

19:49.656 --> 19:50.957
"Eat me, Rebecca"?

19:50.990 --> 19:52.325
Well, I think I will.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.426
Pills don't talk.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.694
Don't take it.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.862
(water running)

19:55.895 --> 19:57.597
She took it.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.400
Let's get to work.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.568
All right, let's see
this presentation...

20:01.601 --> 20:03.336
What is Karen doing?

20:03.370 --> 20:04.571
She put two spaces
after a period.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.905
What is this, 1997?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.440
Well, those have to go.

20:07.474 --> 20:10.377
Okay! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's kicking in right now.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.578
Okay.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.812
And what are these,
Oxford commas?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.447
Well, those have to go, too.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.815
I just gotta... I just gotta
edit this whole thing

20:15.848 --> 20:17.617
before I even start.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.618
Karen!

20:18.651 --> 20:21.954
I would love to show you
around tomorrow morning.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.324
There's, um,
the Chino Hills State Park,

20:24.357 --> 20:26.526
the Azusa Fish Canyon Falls.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.861
May I be so bold as to inquire

20:28.895 --> 20:31.498
your availability and
whereabouts tomorrow afternoon?

20:31.531 --> 20:33.433
Uh, what?

20:33.466 --> 20:35.502
Do you like jazz?

20:35.535 --> 20:37.837
Hot jazz?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.806
Is there any other kind?

20:39.839 --> 20:42.675
There's a small place
in South Pasadena.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.577
My friends who blow horn

20:44.611 --> 20:46.713
say it's the best
little jazz boîte

20:46.746 --> 20:48.381
in town.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.551
Would you and your husband

20:51.584 --> 20:54.921
like to join me
for some smooth licks?

20:57.524 --> 20:59.526
I would.
Mmm.

20:59.559 --> 21:00.727
I would.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.563
Uh, but he's, uh, busy.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.864
(clears throat)

21:04.897 --> 21:06.566
He's... with rehearsal
for his singing group.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.567
He's always busy.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.801
(both laugh)

21:08.835 --> 21:10.770
And, you know,
he's not much of a licker.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.672
Uh-huh.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.974
What time do you want
to pick me up?

21:15.007 --> 21:17.043
Uh...
(chuckling)

21:17.076 --> 21:19.946
*

21:19.979 --> 21:22.449
Okay, so I've been up all night
and I hung the fish,

21:22.482 --> 21:24.016
painted the walls,
put up the mural,

21:24.050 --> 21:25.251
cleaned out the fridge,
redid the grout in the bathroom

21:25.284 --> 21:28.355
and for the finishing touch--
you're gonna be so excited!

21:28.388 --> 21:29.689
Ta-da!

21:29.722 --> 21:32.325
Christmas lights!

21:32.359 --> 21:33.893
So, may I ask

21:33.926 --> 21:36.329
who's crazy now?

21:36.363 --> 21:37.464
I never said you were crazy.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.798
That's a derogatory term

21:38.831 --> 21:41.033
and I don't think
it really applies to you.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.670
Where were you in my senior
gender studies class?

21:43.703 --> 21:45.538
We'll talk about that later.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.375
For now, it's time
to get down to business.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.576
But you know,
before I get down to business,

21:49.609 --> 21:51.411
I'm just gonna see
what my friends are up to.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.679
Instagram-- oh!

21:52.712 --> 21:55.348
Valencia posted a lovely picture
of them in their new bedroom.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.683
It says #Christened--
how nice.

21:56.716 --> 21:57.817
Oh, nice to hear.

21:57.850 --> 21:58.885
How's that working for you?

21:58.918 --> 22:00.687
I don't understand
your question.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.455
But you know what,
I'm starting to realize

22:02.489 --> 22:04.090
that maybe that pill
was not what I needed.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.057
(laughs)
Oh, there's a shocker.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.693
Just spare me.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.428
Spare me the wisecracks.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.629
(line ringing)

22:09.662 --> 22:10.730
Hey, it's me.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.465
You got any downers?

22:16.836 --> 22:21.140
Is this enough
of a downer for you?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.443
Oh, my God.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.844
I'm relaxed.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.813
I could just melt
into the chair, like,

22:26.846 --> 22:28.415
like a butter lady.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.817
That's good.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.686
No, that's bad.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.423
Because I can't
get work done right now.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.627
Oh, I have an idea.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.128
It's the most
fantastic-iest idea.

22:42.161 --> 22:45.732
(both laughing)
That's not a real word.

22:45.765 --> 22:48.535
Seriously, seriously,
seriously.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.836
Seriously,
are you busy right now?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.472
No.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.507
(phone ringing)

22:57.009 --> 22:58.545
Oh...

22:58.578 --> 23:00.179
Honey, hi.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.681
(clears his throat)

23:01.714 --> 23:04.517
Yeah, I-I'll be home in,
like, an hour, tops.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.020
Thanks, Booboo.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.457
(groans)

23:10.490 --> 23:12.525
Valencia's
so mad at me.

23:12.559 --> 23:13.860
We've been here all night,

23:13.893 --> 23:17.530
and I haven't even
finished sorting the screws.

23:20.833 --> 23:24.437
Josh, there's
still time to bail.

23:24.471 --> 23:26.439
On the table,

23:26.473 --> 23:27.674
I mean.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.108
We were friends with you

23:29.141 --> 23:31.444
before we even met this table.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.946
Uh, the truth is

23:33.980 --> 23:36.816
none of us really even

23:36.849 --> 23:39.919
like the current table.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.888
I hate this table.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.790
We don't like, um, this table.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.658
And you're going

23:45.692 --> 23:49.428
to ruin your life
if you stick with this table.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.865
Bros before...

23:52.899 --> 23:54.100
tables.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.868
I think it's a nice thing
you're doing.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.606
Nicest thing I ever did
for a girl was pull out.

23:59.639 --> 24:00.907
Hector?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.642
She has tandem parking,

24:02.675 --> 24:04.511
so after I'm there for a while,
I have to pull out.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.945
Oh.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.914
Which is such a pain,
'cause it feels so great

24:07.947 --> 24:11.017
just to leave it in there.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.652
The worst is when it's alternate
side of the street parking,

24:12.685 --> 24:14.020
'cause then I got
to park it in back.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.922
I don't even get
why there's a spot back there.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.557
It's so tight.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.559
Feels more like an exit.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.027
So then I'm going
front, back,

24:21.060 --> 24:23.596
front, back--
and it's all dirty in the back,

24:23.630 --> 24:27.534
so when I move it to the front,
then that gets all dirty.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.268
I'm just happy
I have a spot at all.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.538
'Cause I used to have to pay.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.910
Well, that was edifying.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.279
Oh!

24:40.312 --> 24:43.015
This burrito is a symphony.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.051
(both giggling)

24:46.218 --> 24:48.755
Dr. Akopian's gonna
be so happy to see me.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.289
When I pop up,
she's gonna be like,

24:50.322 --> 24:52.659
"Whoa, you're so chill!

24:52.692 --> 24:55.061
I'm gonna give you
all the drugs!"

24:55.094 --> 24:56.996
Well, I want to check out
her bathroom floor

24:57.029 --> 24:58.665
and see what else
she has lying around.
Hmm.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.266
I bet her vacuum cleaner
is filled

25:00.299 --> 25:01.934
with cool pharmaceuticals.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.102
That's such a good point!

25:03.135 --> 25:04.203
I know.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.072
I wonder what she
has in there.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.277
(knocking)
Dr. Akopian?

25:11.310 --> 25:13.946
Dr. Akopian,
it's me Rebecca Bunch!

25:13.980 --> 25:16.649
I'm really cool and chill now.

25:16.683 --> 25:19.952
Dr. Akopian?

25:19.986 --> 25:21.888
Okay, not giving up,
not giving up!

25:21.921 --> 25:23.956
Here, Dr. Akopian?

25:23.990 --> 25:25.692
Dr. Akop...?

25:25.725 --> 25:27.827
Oh, my God,
it's her prescription pad.

25:27.860 --> 25:28.861
Oh, I see it!

25:28.895 --> 25:30.930
Wait, she wouldn't have
left it by the window

25:30.963 --> 25:32.599
if she didn't, like, want
somebody to take it, right?

25:32.632 --> 25:34.667
Yeah, it's
like a wizard test.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.002
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.037
Whoa...
(squealing)

25:42.809 --> 25:44.911
Wait, wait,
what are you doing?

25:44.944 --> 25:46.112
You can't fit
through there.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.680
Yeah, yeah,
I totally can.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.115
Because look at me--
look how tiny I am.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.850
I'm tiny-- I'm child-size.
I'm a puppy.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.018
I'm a poodle.
I'm a shrimp.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.653
Yeah, I'm going.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.588
Okay, yeah, all right.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.156
Okay.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.659
Oh, no, I think I'm stuck.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.227
Oh, we forgot.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.229
You're small, but you got those
British-nanny-sized boobs.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.364
(laughing):
British nanny...

26:05.397 --> 26:07.934
(laughs)

26:07.967 --> 26:09.602
(British accent):
Hello, guv'nor.

26:09.636 --> 26:12.071
Please, sir,
may I have some pills?

26:12.104 --> 26:13.906
(laughing)

26:16.676 --> 26:18.678
(jazz music playing)

26:21.113 --> 26:24.116
Ah, your best table,
please, sir.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.117
Oh, I don't work here.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.318
Oh, well, this will spot you

26:26.352 --> 26:28.955
till you get back
on your feet then, huh?

26:28.988 --> 26:30.122
Oh, no, I-I have a job.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.091
Please.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.760
Seat the lady, hmm?

26:36.062 --> 26:38.064
*

26:41.067 --> 26:43.402
Ah, I love jazz.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.105
I mean, the Charlie Brown
theme song, come on.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.374
Ah, The Vince Guaraldi Trio.

26:48.407 --> 26:51.043
Though some mistakenly
think it's Brubek.

26:51.077 --> 26:51.911
(laughs)

26:51.944 --> 26:54.981
Welcome to Smoky Jazzzz.
My name is Ike.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.783
Can I offer you a drink?
Our specialty cocktail tonight

26:56.816 --> 26:58.284
is called The Chimney.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.419
Mmm, well those sound good.

27:00.452 --> 27:04.123
Uh, two of those, uh,
top shelf, and, uh,

27:04.156 --> 27:08.127
make those, uh,
chilled glasses.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.164
Wow, you have
all those fancy cards

27:12.198 --> 27:14.967
I see commercials for.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.302
Well, I like perks.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.905
I live for perks.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.941
Yeah.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.242
(scatting):
* Squeedle doops

27:23.275 --> 27:26.045
* Squeedle, squeedle da doos
* Squeedle...

27:26.078 --> 27:27.379
Uh, hmm.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.447
* Squeedle little lips

27:28.480 --> 27:30.116
* A squeedle leedle lops

27:30.149 --> 27:32.084
* A squeedle leedle loops
squah squeeze squah squahs. *

27:32.118 --> 27:33.886
* Squeeze, hmm, hmm.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.923
Well, this is a
wonderful place.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.224
I've lived here forever.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.091
I didn't even know it was here.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.160
Well, I've learned
in all my travels

27:41.193 --> 27:43.763
all the cities,
no matter what size

27:43.796 --> 27:46.766
has a hidden gem.

27:46.799 --> 27:50.069
Well, where have you been,
traveling-wise?

27:50.102 --> 27:51.437
Oh, everywhere.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.806
You name it, I've been
there at least once.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.208
Paris.
Well, not Paris.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.911
Rome?
I'm more of a domestic traveler.

27:58.945 --> 28:01.247
Right.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.015
I've always wanted to travel.

28:03.049 --> 28:03.783
Hmm?

28:03.816 --> 28:05.117
Scott does.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.385
My husband.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.854
His barbershop quartet
goes to places

28:07.887 --> 28:11.090
like Fresno and Bakersfield.

28:11.123 --> 28:14.493
I would kill
for a trip to Fresno.

28:14.526 --> 28:18.297
Well, you deserve to go to all
the places your heart desires.

28:18.330 --> 28:22.134
Oh, you're very nice.

28:22.168 --> 28:26.038
(song ends, applause)
You are a class act.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.007
(gentle jazz melody plays)

28:28.040 --> 28:30.042
Ooh.
Ooh.

28:38.184 --> 28:42.054
* He's discerning,
he's refined *

28:42.088 --> 28:45.057
* Eats French cheeses,
drinks French wine *

28:45.091 --> 28:47.459
* He travels all the time

28:47.493 --> 28:51.030
* And at the airport
cuts the line *

28:51.063 --> 28:54.000
* And when he checks
his leather luggage *

28:54.033 --> 28:57.069
* No extra charges
are incurred *

28:57.103 --> 28:59.205
* 'Cause he's elite

28:59.238 --> 29:02.241
* He's silver elite

29:02.274 --> 29:05.444
* Executive silver elite

29:05.477 --> 29:09.748
* His status is preferred

29:13.252 --> 29:16.055
* Fine hotels
are where he stays *

29:16.088 --> 29:19.859
* The kind with grand
breakfast buffets *

29:19.892 --> 29:24.296
* And a chef who can make
omelets a variety of ways *

29:24.330 --> 29:28.234
* And they don't stick him
in some regular room *

29:28.267 --> 29:31.503
* No, that would be absurd

29:31.537 --> 29:33.339
* He gets a suite

29:33.372 --> 29:36.308
* A two-room executive suite

29:36.342 --> 29:38.878
* An executive
city-view suite *

29:38.911 --> 29:44.283
* With a second TV
and 400 thread count sheets *

29:44.316 --> 29:47.186
* Because his status

29:47.219 --> 29:50.589
* Is preferred

29:50.622 --> 29:53.525
* Oh, can't you see

29:53.559 --> 29:55.394
* He's got premiere
access to me *

29:55.427 --> 29:58.030
* My whole life

29:58.064 --> 30:00.232
* I've been stuck in

30:00.266 --> 30:03.002
* Economy

30:03.035 --> 30:06.338
* I have waited and waited

30:06.372 --> 30:09.375
* To one day be upgraded

30:09.408 --> 30:12.912
* To spread my wings and fly

30:12.945 --> 30:15.381
* Just a bit more frequently

30:15.414 --> 30:19.018
* On his wrist,
a gold wristwatch *

30:19.051 --> 30:21.988
* On his lips,
a blended scotch *

30:22.021 --> 30:25.024
* And I have to stop
my eyes from drifting *

30:25.057 --> 30:28.127
* Downward
towards his crotch *

30:28.160 --> 30:33.499
* I can peek, but I have
to be discreet *

30:33.532 --> 30:36.235
* 'Cause he's filet mignon

30:36.268 --> 30:39.906
* Not just some piece of meat

30:39.939 --> 30:42.241
* He's sophisticated

30:42.274 --> 30:46.112
* Elegant, elite

30:46.145 --> 30:49.581
* In a word

30:49.615 --> 30:53.485
* He's preferred.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.525
(song ends, applause)

31:05.064 --> 31:07.266
I'm not ready
for this to end.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.268
Are you?

31:09.301 --> 31:11.337
*

31:11.370 --> 31:13.072
(chuckles)

31:17.009 --> 31:17.977
AKOPIAN:
You know I could

31:18.010 --> 31:19.211
have you both arrested?
I didn't do anything.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.947
I'm a student.

31:20.980 --> 31:21.948
On what grounds?

31:21.981 --> 31:23.415
Breaking and entering.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.151
First of all,

31:25.184 --> 31:26.118
I only half-entered.

31:26.152 --> 31:28.220
And second of all,
as far as the breaking goes,

31:28.254 --> 31:32.058
you have no idea of my intent
to steal your prescription pad.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.259
I do now.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.660
Ah!

31:34.693 --> 31:36.195
But since you were both
stoned when you broke in,

31:36.228 --> 31:38.530
and not in your right mind...

31:39.966 --> 31:41.500
...I'm willing
to offer you a deal, Ms. Bunch.

31:43.169 --> 31:45.071
Make an appointment
and start to get help

31:45.104 --> 31:47.439
and I won't press charges
against either of you.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.508
Fine. Yeah. You win.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.676
Let's do this.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.078
I will come in here,

31:52.111 --> 31:53.312
I will explore
my feelings,

31:53.345 --> 31:54.947
do whatever you want.

31:54.981 --> 31:58.050
Now can I have the drugs?

31:58.084 --> 31:59.118
We're done here.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.489
I'm done.

32:03.522 --> 32:06.458
I give up.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.095
I'm gonna take a nap here
for just a... year.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.130
(grunts)

32:13.165 --> 32:14.533
What about your job thingy?

32:14.566 --> 32:18.170
Oh, God,
I hope Darryl doesn't fire me.

32:18.204 --> 32:20.439
Do me a favor?
Can you get my phone?

32:20.472 --> 32:22.041
I think it's in your purse.

32:22.074 --> 32:23.542
I know, I'm just too tired.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.211
Can you get it?

32:25.244 --> 32:27.079
Just put it
in my hand?

32:27.113 --> 32:28.647
Just place it
inside my hand.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.182
It's coming.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.317
Place it inside.

32:31.350 --> 32:32.518
There.
Thank you.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.086
(line ringing)

32:34.120 --> 32:36.022
Mmm...

32:36.055 --> 32:38.157
Hi, Paula. It's me.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.126
Yeah, okay, listen,
I got something to tell you.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.094
I'm not proud of it.

32:42.128 --> 32:45.031
I cannot do the presentation
with Calvin on Monday.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.099
Can you tell Darryl for me?

32:47.133 --> 32:48.734
I'm-I'm actually with Calvin,

32:48.767 --> 32:51.137
so I could just tell him.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.104
What?

32:52.138 --> 32:53.472
Okay.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.407
We are at the hotel
on East Cameron

32:55.441 --> 32:56.742
and he just went out for ice,

32:56.775 --> 32:58.177
and I only have a second.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.178
Hotel?

32:59.211 --> 33:00.446
Why are you at a ho...

33:00.479 --> 33:03.382
Is that Anita Baker playing
in the background?

33:03.415 --> 33:05.151
Oh, oh, he's coming back.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.152
I gotta go.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.153
Paula!

33:07.186 --> 33:08.187
Paula?

33:10.189 --> 33:12.658
I need a cab.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.260
Uber. I need an Uber.

33:14.293 --> 33:15.194
Oh, okay.
Actually, no,

33:15.227 --> 33:17.129
forget the Uber,
it's just around the corner.

33:17.163 --> 33:18.164
Come on.

33:20.066 --> 33:22.168
I've never been
in a hotel room

33:22.201 --> 33:24.036
with a couch before.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.238
Uh, all the perks.

33:26.272 --> 33:27.773
(giggles)

33:27.806 --> 33:31.143
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.279
It's like a fantasy...

33:33.312 --> 33:35.414
like strawberries
and champagne

33:35.447 --> 33:37.783
is just gonna magically
arrive at the door.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.551
(knocking at door)

33:39.585 --> 33:41.753
You didn't!

33:41.787 --> 33:43.122
(laughs)

33:43.155 --> 33:44.123
Hmm.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.158
Oh...

33:49.161 --> 33:51.263
Don't do it!

33:58.304 --> 34:00.139
Look at that.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.607
It's beautiful!

34:01.640 --> 34:03.142
She's gonna love it.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.244
I-I feel so great
about this.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.412
(doorbell rings)
She's here. She's here, guys.

34:06.445 --> 34:07.713
Yeah!
(chuckles)

34:07.746 --> 34:09.380
Okay, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.283
Mwah. Okay. Okay.
Left, left, left, left, left.
Oh!

34:11.317 --> 34:12.384
VALENCIA: What?
Left.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.820
What is it? Is it a puppy?

34:14.853 --> 34:17.656
(cheering, chuckling)

34:17.688 --> 34:20.126
Babe, what am I looking at?

34:20.159 --> 34:22.161
Surprise!

34:22.194 --> 34:23.094
It's your new
dining room table.

34:23.129 --> 34:25.164
We stayed up all night
making it for you.

34:25.197 --> 34:27.433
That you didn't pick out.
And I helped.

34:27.466 --> 34:30.436
That's so sweet.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.538
So, do you like it?

34:32.571 --> 34:35.107
Well...

34:35.141 --> 34:39.110
it doesn't match
our other things.

34:39.145 --> 34:41.813
It's not exactly
what I would've picked out.

34:41.847 --> 34:45.751
Oh, well, I mean, if it's...

34:45.784 --> 34:47.686
not something you want,
I mean, I guess I...

34:47.719 --> 34:51.723
You could take it apart
and give it back?

34:51.757 --> 34:53.425
Josh,

34:53.458 --> 34:55.427
you are so smart.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.395
(chuckles)

34:56.428 --> 34:57.729
That's a great idea.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.431
Give me a kiss.

34:59.465 --> 35:00.399
Mwah.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.600
Okay,

35:01.633 --> 35:05.237
I got to go back to class, you
guys, but thank you so much.

35:05.271 --> 35:06.338
Oh, and
you all should

35:06.372 --> 35:08.307
come over for dinner
when we have the right table.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.341
Yeah? Okay. Bye.

35:09.375 --> 35:13.312
(door opens, closes)

35:13.345 --> 35:16.382
She scares me so bad.

35:18.517 --> 35:19.251
Look, Paula,

35:19.285 --> 35:22.188
I know your
marriage is crap.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.855
I get it. And I get
that you're about to have

35:23.889 --> 35:25.324
the hottest sex
of your life.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.826
Mmm.
Right. So why are
you stopping me?

35:27.859 --> 35:30.296
Because it's not real.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.364
It's a Band-Aid. You know that.

35:32.398 --> 35:35.501
Remember the other day when you
were trying to get me to face

35:35.534 --> 35:38.170
my reality, right? And I didn't
get it? Now I get it.

35:38.204 --> 35:42.241
You're doing
the exact same thing.

35:42.274 --> 35:45.677
You need to face
your real problem,

35:45.711 --> 35:48.680
and your real problem
is that your marriage is dead.

35:48.714 --> 35:51.483
And you need to fully
feel that, and you need

35:51.517 --> 35:56.255
to face it, because this
is just a temporary fix.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.490
It's like a pill you found
on the bathroom floor.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.459
Who would take a pill
they found on the floor?

36:00.492 --> 36:04.963
Look, look, I've spent my whole
life numbing myself, okay?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.698
I have spent my whole life
escaping

36:06.732 --> 36:08.600
to far-off places,
and it's only

36:08.634 --> 36:10.502
recently, like,
now, like, literally

36:10.536 --> 36:12.904
this second that I realize,
like, I can't do that!

36:12.938 --> 36:16.408
I can't do that.
I have to feel my feelings.

36:17.843 --> 36:22.348
It's okay to feel, Paula.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.951
It's been five years since I
made love without the TV on.

36:25.984 --> 36:27.953
(crying)

36:27.986 --> 36:32.558
And ten years since
somebody held my hand.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.660
(both crying)

36:37.629 --> 36:39.631
(Calvin crying)

36:48.440 --> 36:51.510
I-I miss my dead wife.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.845
Come here.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.581
(all crying)

36:55.614 --> 36:59.451
Literally the most entertaining
day of my life.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.487
(Calvin wailing)

37:06.558 --> 37:09.027
Rebecca, making a speech
like that in front

37:09.060 --> 37:11.730
of a potential client, that...

37:11.763 --> 37:12.864
was brave.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.534
Also a bit foolish.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.669
In most cases, clients would run

37:17.703 --> 37:19.671
in the opposite direction.
And I understand

37:19.705 --> 37:21.407
if this means you don't want
to work with me...
Look,

37:21.440 --> 37:24.710
let me finish. You have the kind
of no-nonsense honesty

37:24.743 --> 37:27.579
and raw emotional insight

37:27.613 --> 37:30.516
that I look for in a commercial
real estate lawyer.

37:34.486 --> 37:35.954
(chuckles)

37:40.326 --> 37:44.296
You are a wonderful woman,

37:44.330 --> 37:46.865
Paula.
(chuckles)

37:46.898 --> 37:49.034
This weekend
has been so special.

37:49.067 --> 37:53.472
But marriage
is a precious thing.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.575
If I could hold my wife
for one more second...

37:56.608 --> 37:59.044
Oh. Don't make me cry again.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.712
(exhales)

38:00.746 --> 38:03.281
(sniffling)

38:04.650 --> 38:07.753
Is this alpaca?

38:07.786 --> 38:10.556
It's so soft.

38:10.589 --> 38:15.527
My dead white wife
loved alpaca.

38:15.561 --> 38:18.530
(applause)

38:18.564 --> 38:20.532
What did you say to Calvin?

38:20.566 --> 38:22.501
He was so impressed, he's
not even seeing other people.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.835
I mean, how did you swing that?

38:23.869 --> 38:26.738
I just was honest about...

38:28.374 --> 38:31.009
...about all the great work
you do,

38:31.042 --> 38:32.511
Darryl.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.780
I just made him see
what you wanted him to see,

38:34.813 --> 38:37.516
that we're a group of kickass
lawyers and we're a family.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.851
Yeah.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.019
Oh, Darryl.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.489
It's okay.
Let it out.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.056
Feel your feelings.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.525
Everyone should feel
their feelings.

38:46.558 --> 38:49.528
Everyone should always feel
their feelings.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.597
Well, I, for one,
am feeling peeved,

38:51.630 --> 38:53.532
because this copier...

38:53.565 --> 38:54.466
Cork it, Karen!

38:54.500 --> 38:56.101
But this copier...

38:56.134 --> 38:57.369
Cork it!

39:05.911 --> 39:08.747
Rebecca, I'm very glad
you're welcoming the opportunity

39:08.780 --> 39:10.081
to work on yourself.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.817
I am so grateful to be here,

39:11.850 --> 39:14.152
and I'm excited to face
my problems head-on.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.954
I know it's gonna be hard work,

39:15.987 --> 39:18.424
but it's work
that I am prepared...
(phone chimes)

39:18.457 --> 39:20.726
it's work... I'm sorry.
I should just...

39:20.759 --> 39:22.928
I should make sure
this isn't an emergency.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.963
One second.

39:27.633 --> 39:32.137
You know what, I'm feeling
better already, actually.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.139
So I'm-I'm
gonna go

39:34.172 --> 39:36.642
to this very important thing,
but I want to let you know

39:36.675 --> 39:39.645
that this is not over.
I'll see you next week.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.647
JOSH:
What? Get out of here!

39:41.680 --> 39:43.815
A rice cooker?

39:43.849 --> 39:45.584
That's perfect!

39:45.617 --> 39:47.185
Because Valencia is Mexican
and I'm Filipino

39:47.218 --> 39:49.521
and rice is a staple
in both of our...

39:49.555 --> 39:51.423
Cultures. Yeah.
Right.

39:51.457 --> 39:55.627
Uh, oh, sorry it took me forever
to return your call from Friday.

39:55.661 --> 39:58.430
Oh, my gosh, you... You're so
busy. Don't even think about it.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.165
Hey, can I ask you
something?

40:00.198 --> 40:02.033
Anything.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.606
Is this a nice table?

40:08.640 --> 40:11.843
It's a perfect table.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.845
(chuckles)

40:13.879 --> 40:15.814
That's what I think.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.683
Thanks.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.184
No problem.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.187
Uh, hey, um,

40:22.220 --> 40:24.089
do you want to come
over sometime, just check out

40:24.122 --> 40:25.156
the new place?

40:25.190 --> 40:26.958
There's not a lot of furniture,
so there's plenty

40:26.992 --> 40:28.660
of room to slip and slide around

40:28.694 --> 40:29.561
in our socks
like in Risky Business.

40:29.595 --> 40:31.096
Oh, my God,
that sounds amazing. Yes.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.531
When? Now?
(laughs)

40:32.564 --> 40:33.765
Just, like, don't tell Valencia,

40:33.799 --> 40:34.766
'cause she thinks it's stupid.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.201
Well, Valencia's stupid.

40:36.234 --> 40:39.204
Sorry. I'm sure she's smart
in her own way.

40:39.237 --> 40:40.205
But anyway I have

40:40.238 --> 40:42.474
the perfect slippy-slidey socks.

40:42.508 --> 40:43.742
(both laugh)

40:43.775 --> 40:45.043
Yeah.
MAN:
Number 31.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.481
Oh, no. Don't you start with me.

40:49.515 --> 40:50.649
Just keep walking, old man.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.883
Excuse me?

40:51.917 --> 40:53.685
You heard me.
Get out of my life.

40:53.719 --> 40:56.254
Oh, my God, uh, Dr. Phil.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.789
I'm a huge fan.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.725
DR. PHIL:
How you doing?
Oh.

40:59.758 --> 41:02.661
I'm s... Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry.
You're actually Dr. Phil.

41:02.694 --> 41:03.962
In the flesh. It's me.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.164
Even Dr. Phil has got
to have his boba.

41:06.197 --> 41:07.799
I'm addicted to these things.

41:07.833 --> 41:08.800
(laughs)

41:08.834 --> 41:09.801
Maybe you should, uh,

41:09.835 --> 41:11.136
get help for that.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.804
(chuckles)
Yeah.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.873
You guys make
a really cute couple.

41:14.906 --> 41:17.976
Oh. That's so funny.
We're not a couple.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.878
No, no, no. We're just friends.
That's so funny. He thinks

41:19.911 --> 41:22.681
we're a couple. That's so funny.
We're not a couple.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.149
He thinks we're a couple.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.851
That's so funny,
but we're not a couple.

41:25.884 --> 41:26.852
He thinks we're a couple.

41:26.885 --> 41:30.488
Yeah. G-Good luck to you, buddy.

41:35.561 --> 41:38.196
(door closes)

41:38.229 --> 41:43.001
* Mmm, it's the sexy
gonna-do-it song *

41:43.034 --> 41:46.538
* The sexy gonna-do-it song

41:46.572 --> 41:48.907
* We're gonna do it,
we're gonna do it *

41:48.940 --> 41:53.612
* It's a sexy gonna-do-it song

41:53.645 --> 41:55.113
I hope... I hope
you're cool with that.
