I gotta warn her.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.065
Or her or ju--

10:56.240 --> 11:00.819
Ooh. A spell for shiny, manageable hair.

11:02.871 --> 11:05.114
Hey, hello, future fellow lion.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.742
Hey, what are you doing here?
Isn't your prom tonight?

11:08.210 --> 11:10.038
Oh, my,
I have been so overwhelmed

11:10.212 --> 11:11.837
with thinking
about going to your school

11:12.005 --> 11:13.417
that I completely forgot about it.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.671
Wait a second.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.634
Did something happen
between you and Harvey?

11:16.802 --> 11:19.128
I mean, don't let going to Emerson
hurt your relationship.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.965
You know,
this prom is something special--

11:21.181 --> 11:23.091
- Like to go to the prom with me?
- Absolutely.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.548
You like gardenias?

11:28.146 --> 11:29.227
Watch it.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.935
BOTH:
<i>For Boston, for Boston!</i>

11:31.108 --> 11:32.271
<i>For thee and thine alone!</i>

11:32.484 --> 11:35.272
Let me guess, Sabrina's decided
to go to Boston College.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.030
Yeah, B.C.'s got everything I want.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.614
Good classes, fun
and most importantly,

11:40.784 --> 11:43.110
Fridays
is eat-your-own-weight-in-noodles day.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.073
Boolah. Boolah, boolah.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.821
Come on, Harv, let's go grab
some guys and throw the ball.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.246
Are you kidding?

11:49.459 --> 11:50.575
Hi, tonight's the prom.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.912
The culmination
of our entire high school experience.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.714
Harvey and I have a lot to do.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.006
I should take a shower.

11:58.302 --> 12:01.007
<i>- Ciao.</i>
- Later, Sabrina. Sabrina?

12:03.724 --> 12:07.141
Now, normally, we'd need
a subatomic particle accelerator

12:07.311 --> 12:08.806
to fuse the molecules.

12:09.313 --> 12:14.901
But with a pinch of magic
and a sprinkle of cardamom...

12:17.112 --> 12:20.696
Voilà, we can create a new element
in the privacy of our own home.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.696
Naturally,
I'm taking Intro to Magical Chemistry.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.747
Oh, dear,
I've monopolised your whole day.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.706
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for the prom?

12:28.874 --> 12:31.413
But what about you? Aren't you
gonna chaperone with Mr. Kraft?

12:31.585 --> 12:33.377
Well, I...

12:33.545 --> 12:36.832
You see, Willard and I
stopped seeing each other.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.586
Please don't cheer.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.254
Aunt Zelda, I'm so sorry.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.884
No matter what my personal feelings
are for him,

12:43.055 --> 12:46.258
I know how much you cared about him
and somehow managed to love him.

12:46.475 --> 12:47.555
I did.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.726
And that's why I think you should go
to the prom

12:49.895 --> 12:52.434
and remind him what a smart,
funny, attractive woman you are,

12:52.606 --> 12:54.434
and leave him regretting the day
he was born.

12:55.234 --> 12:57.393
What a wonderful idea.

12:57.569 --> 13:01.070
There's no reason I can't go
and make him miserable.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.242
Oh, but can't we just do
one more experiment?

13:04.409 --> 13:05.490
Oh, Sabrina,

13:05.702 --> 13:08.325
I've waited my whole life
to hear you say that.

13:08.539 --> 13:09.738
What you doing?

13:09.915 --> 13:13.202
I decided that pack is way too small for
all the things that you're gonna need.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.913
That's why I got you this.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.084
SABRINA:
A Sherpa and a yak?

13:18.257 --> 13:22.006
Well, I hear they're great company,
and I'm sure I'll enjoy the Sherpa too.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.500
Wanna come with me backpacking?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.216
This is one of those
rites of passage

13:25.389 --> 13:27.963
that you absolutely
have to experience alone.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.593
Well, do you wanna come
to my prom with me tonight?

13:30.811 --> 13:31.843
- Sure.
- Hey,

13:32.020 --> 13:34.726
we can set off the sprinklers
during the slow dance.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.776
Oh, I always knew
you liked me best.

13:38.569 --> 13:41.108
I just can't shake
this nagging feeling

13:41.280 --> 13:43.949
that there's something I'm supposed
to tell Hilda and Zelda.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.866
Aunt Hilda, I'm running a little late.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.827
HILDA:
Me too.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.448
Oh, I forgot the blow-dryer.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.124
If Josh calls, tell him I'm on my way.

13:54.293 --> 13:56.002
Okay.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.832
Another 20 minutes.

Make it 30.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.250
That Other Realm beauty parlour
was a great idea.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.966
I think I got all the mud out.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.507
Well, there's no reason a woman
can't discover cold fusion

14:09.683 --> 14:12.519
and look like her Internet start-up
just went public.

14:15.272 --> 14:16.471
I'll be right down, Harvey.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.518
I think I left my earrings
in the bathroom.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.566
Wait. Now I remember.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.315

Where's Harvey?
I thought he'd pick you up.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.299
Oh, but I wanted to come with you.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.295
- Is that Mr. Kraft?
- It sure is.

14:45.469 --> 14:48.471
I'd recognise
that spray-on hair anywhere.

14:48.639 --> 14:51.594
- He's looking.
- All right, just walk slowly.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.887
- Think we lost him?
- Yeah.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.848
That security guard
had no sense of humour.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.814
- Confiscating our pig's blood?
- I know.

14:58.982 --> 15:03.277
I swear, sometimes I think I'm the only
one who thought <i>Carrie</i> was a comedy.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.733
Doesn't Westbridge
throw a great prom?

15:06.949 --> 15:08.112
Go Westbridge.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.235
It's nice to finally get
to slow dance with you

15:10.410 --> 15:11.989
without a scoreboard
in the background.

15:13.622 --> 15:16.873
- What would you like to drink?
- Oh, I want what you want.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.162
Don't feel bad, Aunt Zelda.

15:22.339 --> 15:26.172
I mean, in this light, Mr. Kraft
and the lunch lady do look a lot alike.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.593
How'd you get here so fast?

15:32.808 --> 15:35.264
I've been cooling my Guccis here
for about ten minutes.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.723
That a different dress?

15:36.937 --> 15:38.397
Than I had on yesterday.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.307
Oh, delightful. Thank you.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.561
Hope that wasn't awkward
with Harvey.

Fine.

What do you think happened to me?

would you please tell this guy

She's a popular little miscreant.

If she likes you so much,
how come she's going to Emerson?

and tell him you didn't invite him
to the prom?

20:13.630 --> 20:15.458
- But I did invite him to the prom.
JOSH: See?

20:17.968 --> 20:20.425
Did this conversation
just take a frightening turn?

20:20.637 --> 20:22.298
No, I invited Josh to the prom

20:22.472 --> 20:26.139
because I wanted you all here
to make a formal announcement.

here goes.

I don't know
how you're all gonna take this,

is Adams.
