01:27:08.593 --> 01:27:10.186
<i>Previously on "Sports Night"...</i>

01:27:10.262 --> 01:27:11.696
-- How you doin'?
-- Dan.

01:27:11.763 --> 01:27:13.390
-- I knew I knew you.
-- Yes.

01:27:13.465 --> 01:27:15.627
-- You're Steve Siscds wife.
-- Ex-wife.

01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:19.295
-- <i>Why</i> are <i>you avoiding me?</i> -- <i>Take</i>
a <i>wild, flailing shot in the dark.</i>

01:27:19.371 --> 01:27:20.668
'Cause you thought
Steve and I were divorced

01:27:20.739 --> 01:27:21.900
when, in reality,
we're only separated,

01:27:21.973 --> 01:27:23.270
and Steve wants us to go
back into counseling

01:27:23.341 --> 01:27:25.207
and I'm on the fence about it
and you hate Steve?

01:27:25.277 --> 01:27:28.508
-- <i>That's amazing.</i> -- <i>And then there was that
thing where somebody tried to blow us up.</i>

01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:30.674
<i>Dan: Yeah.
-- Don't take it personally.</i>

01:27:30.749 --> 01:27:32.774
-- No, I think I <i>will</i> take it personally.
-- The bomb threat was a hoax.

01:27:32.851 --> 01:27:34.683
-- What was it about?
-- Denny Denton.

01:27:34.753 --> 01:27:36.312
-- What <i>about him?</i> -- <i>They
don't iike his radio show.</i>

01:27:36.388 --> 01:27:37.583
I don't like
his radio show either.

01:27:37.656 --> 01:27:39.317
-- You know what I do?
Change the station. -- What?

01:27:39.391 --> 01:27:42.088
<i>And, oh, yeah, Isaac's lying in a
bed at Columbia Pres with a stroke.</i>

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.753
<i>You dumped the show off
to Sally.</i>

01:27:43.829 --> 01:27:45.991
It was after 1:00
in the morning.

01:27:46.064 --> 01:27:47.361
-- 'Cause Gordon was here.
-- Yes.

01:27:47.432 --> 01:27:49.491
-- And you want me to let
you off the hook. -- Yes.

01:27:49.568 --> 01:27:52.265
VVell, later, when there's time, I'll
see if I can let you off the hook.

01:27:52.337 --> 01:27:55.307
Right now there's not time to let you off
the hook. Right now there's our show.

01:27:55.373 --> 01:27:58.343
-- You'll let me know if something more
important comes along, right? -- Yeah.

01:27:58.410 --> 01:28:02.244
-- What's going on? -- <i>I</i> want
so <i>badly to</i> rip his face off.

01:28:06.284 --> 01:28:07.979
<i>Casey: It's been a week.
Dan: I know.</i>

01:28:08.053 --> 01:28:09.987
-- <i>It's been</i> a <i>week.</i> -- <i>As</i> a
<i>matter of fact, it hasn't.</i>

01:28:10.055 --> 01:28:11.079
No, it's been a week.

01:28:11.156 --> 01:28:12.123
It's been six days.

01:28:12.190 --> 01:28:13.419
It's a week ago tomorrow.

01:28:13.492 --> 01:28:14.823
It was a week ago tomorrow

01:28:14.893 --> 01:28:17.453
-- that somebody tried to
blow up the building. -- Yes.

01:28:17.529 --> 01:28:18.997
-- Tomorrow it'll be a week.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

01:28:19.064 --> 01:28:20.589
Since the time
that somebody tried

01:28:20.665 --> 01:28:22.030
to blow up the building.

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.864
Yes, and I think it's time
for you to get over it.

01:28:23.935 --> 01:28:24.959
That doesn't really seem like

01:28:25.036 --> 01:28:26.299
it's gonna happen, though,
does it?

01:28:26.371 --> 01:28:27.361
I'm not optimistic.

01:28:27.439 --> 01:28:28.736
60 seconds to VTR.
Two minutes live.

01:28:28.807 --> 01:28:30.104
-- Ready-1.
-- Stand by, animation.

01:28:30.175 --> 01:28:32.735
<i>Sand by, one and FIX-L.</i>

01:28:32.811 --> 01:28:33.744
I'm forgetting things.

01:28:33.812 --> 01:28:34.802
What are you forgetting?

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.075
Nothing specific.

01:28:36.147 --> 01:28:37.911
You're not forgetting
anything specific?

01:28:37.983 --> 01:28:40.042
No, I just have this sense

01:28:40.118 --> 01:28:42.519
about me of forgetting things,
losing things.

01:28:42.587 --> 01:28:43.418
What have you lost?

01:28:43.488 --> 01:28:45.013
Nothing specific.

01:28:45.090 --> 01:28:47.525
You know, you're almost tempted
to consider the possibility

01:28:47.592 --> 01:28:49.686
that I am just going
stark-raving mad.

01:28:49.761 --> 01:28:50.922
You sure don't
have to sell me.

01:28:50.996 --> 01:28:53.226
Casey, Robbie Alomar just made

01:28:53.298 --> 01:28:54.595
-- <i>the last out at first.</i>
-- Thank <i>you.</i>

01:28:54.666 --> 01:28:56.361
Wouldn't you think
that when a guy threatens

01:28:56.434 --> 01:28:58.095
to blow up a building
in the name of God --

01:28:58.169 --> 01:29:01.036
wouldn't you think that religious leaders
would step forward at that point?

01:29:01.106 --> 01:29:04.974
-- I do. -- Wouldn't you think that rabbis
and priests and ministers and cardinals

01:29:05.043 --> 01:29:08.069
would step forward and say, “Fella, we
think that pretty much any hope you have

01:29:08.146 --> 01:29:10.774
of getting into Heaven will be ruined
if you blow up that building“?

01:29:10.849 --> 01:29:12.283
-- Wouldn't you think they'd say that?
-- I would.

01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:13.943
-- And when they didn't --
-- Casey...

01:29:14.019 --> 01:29:15.953
-- What? -- It's just we've had this
conversation a few times already.

01:29:16.021 --> 01:29:18.115
-- When they didn't... -- Wouldn't
I think somebody would ask why?

01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:19.623
Wouldn't you think
somebody would ask why?

01:29:19.691 --> 01:29:21.159
Yes.

01:29:21.226 --> 01:29:23.058
You agree?

01:29:23.128 --> 01:29:24.562
-- I'm right with you.
-- Thank you.

01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:26.961
I, however,
have decided to move on.

01:29:27.032 --> 01:29:28.966
-- So you're not with me?
-- I am.

01:29:29.034 --> 01:29:32.231
No. I'm here.
You've moved on.

01:29:32.304 --> 01:29:33.465
Yes.

01:29:33.538 --> 01:29:36.064
There are three things
that I'm doing.

01:29:36.141 --> 01:29:40.408
I'm losing things, I'm forgetting
things, and there's a third one.

01:29:40.478 --> 01:29:42.003
Roll VTR.
60 seconds live.

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.447
Everybody, this is your nightly
two-minute confirmation

01:29:44.516 --> 01:29:46.109
that I'm still
Jeremy's girlfriend.

01:29:46.184 --> 01:29:47.583
-- No, you're not.
-- I am.

01:29:47.652 --> 01:29:48.710
-- She's not.
-- Oh, yes.

01:29:48.787 --> 01:29:50.755
I've broken up with you.
I've broken up with you,

01:29:50.822 --> 01:29:52.847
and I break up with you again
right there.

01:29:52.924 --> 01:29:55.086
Right then is when I did it.
We just broke up.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.594
Look, whoosh --
I ended it.

01:29:56.661 --> 01:29:58.561
-- Can <i>we please</i> --
-- <i>fl Jeremy loves me fl</i>

01:29:58.630 --> 01:29:59.756
<i>Dave: 30 seconds live.</i>

01:29:59.831 --> 01:30:01.162
-- You were with me.
-- Yes.

01:30:01.232 --> 01:30:03.428
-- You were with me for a time.
-- In 10.

01:30:03.501 --> 01:30:05.595
You were with me for a time,
and then you moved on.

01:30:05.670 --> 01:30:07.866
-- I <i>did.</i>
-- <i>You moved far away.</i>

01:30:07.939 --> 01:30:10.670
-- <i>Not far enough.</i>
-- <i>In 3...2...</i>

01:30:10.742 --> 01:30:12.642
Good evening.
From New York City,

01:30:12.711 --> 01:30:14.839
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.

01:30:14.913 --> 01:30:19.475
Those stories, plus we've got double plays in
the VVest and triple threats in the South.

01:30:19.551 --> 01:30:20.677
We've got the Phoenix Suns
in the morning.

01:30:20.752 --> 01:30:22.379
We've got Warren Moon
at night.

01:30:22.454 --> 01:30:26.152
We got rhythm, music, the works
-- all that coming up after this.

01:30:26.224 --> 01:30:29.125
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so stick around.

01:30:29.194 --> 01:30:30.958
<i>We're out.</i>

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.229
<i>Jeremy: Yes.</i>

01:30:37.302 --> 01:30:38.929
Yes. You're breaking up now.

01:30:39.004 --> 01:30:40.369
Hello? You're breaking up.

01:30:40.438 --> 01:30:41.872
Now you're not there at all.

01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:43.339
There's nobody there at all,

01:30:43.408 --> 01:30:45.706
yet I'm still talking.

01:30:45.777 --> 01:30:48.269
-- All right. Oh, Dana...
-- Yes?

01:30:48.346 --> 01:30:49.814
I was just talking
to a guy in Trinidad.

01:30:49.881 --> 01:30:50.905
When were you in Trinidad?

01:30:50.982 --> 01:30:52.507
I wasn't in Trinidad.
The guy was in Trinidad.

01:30:52.584 --> 01:30:54.814
-- He was talking to me about a
cricket match in New Delhi. -- But...

01:30:54.886 --> 01:30:56.149
No, neither of us
were in New Delhi.

01:30:56.221 --> 01:30:57.484
The cricket match
was in New Delhi.

01:30:57.555 --> 01:30:59.546
The guy was in Trinidad.
I was right here.

01:30:59.624 --> 01:31:01.217
-- Have you seen my shoes?
-- What?

01:31:01.292 --> 01:31:02.919
I'm missing my shoes.

01:31:02.994 --> 01:31:05.759
-- Among other things, yes. Dana,
seriously -- -- The cricket player.

01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:06.854
It was incredible.

01:31:06.931 --> 01:31:08.922
-- What was incredible?
-- I don't know.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.026
-- You don't know? -- I don't
know anything about cricket.

01:31:12.103 --> 01:31:16.040
-- Brown suede heels. You really haven't
seen them? -- No, I really haven't.

01:31:16.107 --> 01:31:18.075
-- You don't know anything about cricket?
-- That's what I'm saying.

01:31:18.143 --> 01:31:19.838
-- Really? Nothing?
-- Yeah. No.

01:31:19.911 --> 01:31:22.380
No information you can
give me about my shoes?

01:31:22.447 --> 01:31:24.313
Dana, a very big sports story
is happening.

01:31:24.382 --> 01:31:27.113
Jeremy, if a very big sports story
was happening, we'd know it.

01:31:27.185 --> 01:31:29.051
We <i>do</i> know it.
We just don't understand it.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.646
-- You don't understand it.
-- You understand cricket?

01:31:31.723 --> 01:31:32.952
-- I know a little something.
-- What?

01:31:33.024 --> 01:31:35.823
-- I know they drink tea. -- <i>I</i>
think they do more than <i>that.</i>

01:31:35.894 --> 01:31:39.057
I didn't claim to be
a student of the game.

01:31:39.130 --> 01:31:42.065
-- Natalie, do you know anything about
cricket? -- I know they drink tea.

01:31:42.133 --> 01:31:44.033
-- Ahh. Elliott?
-- No.

01:31:44.102 --> 01:31:45.536
Kim, do you know anything
about cricket?

01:31:45.603 --> 01:31:48.072
-- <i>What's</i> going <i>on?</i> -- <i>Some guy
in New Deihi just did something.</i>

01:31:48.139 --> 01:31:50.471
-- What?
-- <i>Jeremy won't tell us.</i>

01:31:50.542 --> 01:31:52.567
I honestly don't know. And I
wouldn't have even brought it up

01:31:52.644 --> 01:31:54.169
except whatever this guy did,
it was huge.

01:31:54.245 --> 01:31:56.236
-- What <i>did</i> he <i>do?</i> -- <i>He took
all 1O wickets in an inning.</i>

01:31:56.314 --> 01:31:57.804
-- What does that mean?
-- <i>I don't know.</i>

01:31:57.882 --> 01:31:59.179
Elliott, get on
the international wire

01:31:59.250 --> 01:32:00.479
and get the play-by-play
for Jeremy

01:32:00.552 --> 01:32:02.350
of this cricket match
in Tripoli.

01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:04.354
Trinidad, and the cricket
match was in New Delhi.

01:32:04.422 --> 01:32:07.187
I don't think it matters if the cricket
match was at the Carnegie Deli.

01:32:07.258 --> 01:32:09.727
We're not gonna know what the
hell went on, but get it anyway.

01:32:09.794 --> 01:32:11.853
-- The guy's name is Chauncy St.
John. -- What <i>guy?</i>

01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:13.921
The guy, the cricket player.
His name is Chauncy St. John.

01:32:13.998 --> 01:32:15.557
-- <i>Elliott, go.</i>
-- <i>Got it.</i>

01:32:15.633 --> 01:32:17.692
<i>Dan, do you know anything
about cricket?</i>

01:32:17.769 --> 01:32:21.000
Ah, cricket -- the game
of the civilized sportsman.

01:32:21.072 --> 01:32:23.063
-- Do you know anything about it?
-- No.

01:32:23.141 --> 01:32:24.905
-- <i>You like it, though?</i>
-- <i>What's not to like?</i>

01:32:24.976 --> 01:32:26.569
They wear white.
They drink tea.

01:32:26.644 --> 01:32:28.544
A guy in New Zealand
got all 10 rickets.

01:32:28.613 --> 01:32:30.604
Wickets in New Delhi!

01:32:30.682 --> 01:32:31.774
This is
an international news story!

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:33.215
There are countries
other than ours.

01:32:33.284 --> 01:32:36.413
Yes. There is, for instance,
Belgium, to name but one.

01:32:36.488 --> 01:32:37.717
-- <i>What's up?</i>
-- <i>Please don't ask.</i>

01:32:37.789 --> 01:32:39.553
Don't ask about what?

01:32:39.624 --> 01:32:42.992
Jeremy was on the phone with a man
who was in Trinidad at the time

01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:45.359
who told him of a cricket player
in New Delhi

01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:47.364
who got all 10 wickets
in one inning.

01:32:47.432 --> 01:32:49.958
-- Thought I was gonna blow it, didn't you?
-- Yes, I did.

01:32:50.034 --> 01:32:51.559
-- Anyway, don't ask.
-- Okay.

01:32:51.636 --> 01:32:53.365
Folks, [Clears throat]
before we start,

01:32:53.438 --> 01:32:57.238
I'd like to say I've been forgetting
things lately -- losing things.

01:32:57.308 --> 01:32:58.605
I apologize in advance.

01:32:58.676 --> 01:33:00.701
You'll all know it
when you see it.

01:33:00.779 --> 01:33:02.577
Anyway, that's all.

01:33:02.647 --> 01:33:05.639
[Sighs]

01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:10.920
We have
a rundown meeting now.

01:33:10.989 --> 01:33:11.922
<i>-- Mm-hmm. -- Mm-hmm.
-- Yep. -- Yep.</i>

01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:13.981
[Clears throat]

01:33:14.058 --> 01:33:15.355
Item one...

01:33:18.062 --> 01:33:20.622
<i>This is
from The World Observer.</i>

01:33:20.698 --> 01:33:22.462
It says if you compared it
to baseball,

01:33:22.534 --> 01:33:25.731
it would be like pitching three perfect
games on three consecutive days.

01:33:25.804 --> 01:33:28.171
-- Really?
-- Wait. No, not exactly.

01:33:28.239 --> 01:33:29.468
Why not exactly?

01:33:29.541 --> 01:33:31.635
It says the final four batters
scored 16 runs.

01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:34.508
-- That doesn't sound good. -- It
certainly doesn't sound perfect.

01:33:34.579 --> 01:33:37.048
-- Right. -- In baseball, if your
final four batters scored 16 runs,

01:33:37.115 --> 01:33:39.083
it would be hard
to consider that perfect.

01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:41.312
Jeremy, I don't know how comfortable I
am reporting a story I don't understand.

01:33:41.386 --> 01:33:42.979
It's not that hard
to understand.

01:33:43.054 --> 01:33:45.489
There's a bowler, see,
and there's a batsman.

01:33:45.557 --> 01:33:47.082
-- What's a bowler?
-- I don't know.

01:33:47.158 --> 01:33:48.751
-- What's a batsman?
-- I don't know.

01:33:48.827 --> 01:33:50.591
Well, keep it up.

01:33:50.662 --> 01:33:53.256
-- <i>Hey, hey, ask me my name.</i>
-- <i>What's your name?</i>

01:33:53.331 --> 01:33:54.389
-- Mr. Happy Guy.
-- Rebecca?

01:33:54.465 --> 01:33:56.365
Flying back tonight,
meeting me after the show.

01:33:56.434 --> 01:33:58.095
-- Good. -- I love it when
she meets me after the show.

01:33:58.169 --> 01:34:02.936
Here's something. Raj Rajhan edged
a humble snorter to the slips,

01:34:03.007 --> 01:34:06.375
where Saurav Ganguly dived to his
right to pick up a low snatch.

01:34:07.712 --> 01:34:10.272
The humble snorter
went straight to the slips,

01:34:10.348 --> 01:34:13.443
and obviously the snatch
was lower than it ordinarily is.

01:34:13.518 --> 01:34:14.781
Yes.

01:34:14.853 --> 01:34:17.481
-- I'm getting to the bottom of this.
-- Keep me posted.

01:34:19.824 --> 01:34:21.189
-- Casey...
-- Yes?

01:34:21.259 --> 01:34:23.250
-- I'm Mr. Happy Guy.
-- Yeah, we met back there.

01:34:23.328 --> 01:34:24.693
-- I don't believe it.
-- What?

01:34:24.762 --> 01:34:26.389
-- You're not with me.
-- I'm with you.

01:34:26.464 --> 01:34:29.866
-- No, I wasn't with you on the religious
leaders deal, so this is payback. -- Yes.

01:34:29.934 --> 01:34:31.095
-- This is punitive.
-- Yes, it is.

01:34:31.169 --> 01:34:32.637
These are two
totally different things.

01:34:32.704 --> 01:34:34.297
I'm excited
'cause Rebecca's back,

01:34:34.372 --> 01:34:36.363
and you're, you know,
just a ranting lunatic.

01:34:36.441 --> 01:34:38.205
I am not a ranting lunatic.

01:34:38.276 --> 01:34:40.244
This is honest outrage.

01:34:40.311 --> 01:34:41.710
Somebody made a bomb threat

01:34:41.779 --> 01:34:44.749
because a radio deejay did a
sketch where Jesus was gay.

01:34:44.816 --> 01:34:48.753
In the name of religion, this man
threatened the lives of about 700 people.

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:52.188
The absence of admonishment from
the church is totally bizarre.

01:34:52.257 --> 01:34:53.418
Yes.

01:34:53.491 --> 01:34:54.720
Yes?

01:34:54.792 --> 01:34:55.884
I'm with you.

01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:57.223
-- Now you're just saying that.
-- No, I'm not.

01:34:57.295 --> 01:34:58.592
You're just saying that
because you want me

01:34:58.663 --> 01:34:59.824
to be with you
on the other thing.

01:34:59.898 --> 01:35:01.127
-- I'm not.
-- Yes, you are.

01:35:01.199 --> 01:35:03.964
Yes, I am, but I can fake my enthusiasm,
and you'll never know the difference.

01:35:04.035 --> 01:35:07.232
-- That's all I'm asking. -- So the deal
is I'll be outraged about your thing

01:35:07.305 --> 01:35:09.171
and you'll be happy
'cause Rebecca's back.

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.605
Fine.

01:35:11.976 --> 01:35:14.445
-- You're not happy.
-- I am.

01:35:14.512 --> 01:35:16.173
No, you're not. You're not
happy that Rebecca's back.

01:35:16.247 --> 01:35:19.080
-- Danny, this is gonna go badly for you.
-- No, it's not.

01:35:19.150 --> 01:35:20.709
She's got a blind spot
for Steve Sisco.

01:35:20.785 --> 01:35:23.413
-- Her ex-husband is not -- -- It's not
her ex-husband. They're separated.

01:35:23.488 --> 01:35:25.456
-- I know. He's a jerk, Casey. --
They're in counseling. I know.

01:35:25.523 --> 01:35:27.753
-- You should have seen the way he treated
her. -- I know how he treated her.

01:35:27.825 --> 01:35:30.089
-- And yet you still think she's gonna
end up going back to him? -- Danny...

01:35:30.161 --> 01:35:32.027
-- Be happy for me.
-- I am happy for you.

01:35:32.096 --> 01:35:34.224
-- You faking it?
-- It doesn't matter.

01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:41.271
I'm right here.
I'm right here, Isaac.

01:35:41.339 --> 01:35:43.706
I'm in your office right now.
Mm-hmm.

01:35:43.775 --> 01:35:46.437
I've got everything
completely under control...

01:35:46.511 --> 01:35:48.946
except I can't find my shoes.
[Chuckles]

01:35:49.013 --> 01:35:50.174
No.

01:35:51.182 --> 01:35:52.479
No.

01:35:53.618 --> 01:35:56.315
That's a funny joke --
did I look on my feet?

01:35:56.387 --> 01:36:00.585
You're a senile old man, and this stroke is a
punishment for not having been nicer to me.

01:36:01.926 --> 01:36:04.258
Then why won't you let me
come down there?

01:36:04.329 --> 01:36:06.093
You heard what I said.

01:36:06.197 --> 01:36:09.292
-- I said, “Then why won't you let me
come down there?“ -- Is that Isaac?

01:36:09.334 --> 01:36:11.632
-- Natalie's here.
-- Let me talk to him.

01:36:11.703 --> 01:36:13.831
-- She says she doesn't want
to talk to you. -- Yes, I do.

01:36:13.905 --> 01:36:17.341
'Cause you're a stubborn person, and she's not
interested in speaking to stubborn people.

01:36:17.408 --> 01:36:18.671
-- Yes, I am.
-- No.

01:36:18.743 --> 01:36:20.609
She's flat-out refusing.

01:36:20.678 --> 01:36:21.941
Goodbye.

01:36:22.981 --> 01:36:24.312
<i>He's very stubborn.</i>

01:36:24.382 --> 01:36:25.941
What's he say?

01:36:26.017 --> 01:36:28.748
-- He made it up and down the
corridor with a cane. -- Good!

01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:30.515
I can't believe he won't
let us come down there.

01:36:30.588 --> 01:36:32.488
-- Leave it alone.
-- I won't leave it alone.

01:36:32.557 --> 01:36:33.786
No, I don't think you will.

01:36:33.858 --> 01:36:35.451
-- He's being stubborn.
-- Then he is.

01:36:35.526 --> 01:36:36.994
-- That's right.
-- Dana...

01:36:37.061 --> 01:36:40.554
This is a fully grown man of
enormous dignity and accomplishment.

01:36:40.631 --> 01:36:42.497
He's covered wars
and he's dined with kings,

01:36:42.567 --> 01:36:44.399
and he can't move
the left side of his body,

01:36:44.469 --> 01:36:47.166
and he doesn't want us to see him
like that. Now, what's wrong?

01:36:47.238 --> 01:36:51.300
-- Every/thing's wrong. -- I mean with the
forgetting things and the losing things.

01:36:51.376 --> 01:36:52.639
-- I don't know.
-- Really?

01:36:52.710 --> 01:36:54.804
-- I don't know.
-- Okay.

01:36:54.879 --> 01:36:56.643
I know I don't like Casey
being mad at me.

01:36:56.714 --> 01:36:58.739
-- I know. -- He's never
gonna stop being mad at me.

01:36:58.816 --> 01:37:00.113
-- Yes, he is.
-- Here's the thing.

01:37:00.184 --> 01:37:02.619
-- What?
-- He's got a point.

01:37:11.829 --> 01:37:15.163
[Cheers and applause]

01:37:17.468 --> 01:37:19.493
That is a spectacular play.

01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:21.163
You don't even know
what you're looking at.

01:37:21.239 --> 01:37:22.502
-- Yes, I do.
-- No, you don't.

01:37:22.573 --> 01:37:24.166
I'm a sports professional,
gumdrop,

01:37:24.242 --> 01:37:25.835
and I happen to know
a little something

01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:28.470
about the cricket stylings of New
Guinea's Mr. Chutney St. Joan.

01:37:28.546 --> 01:37:30.810
Yes, New Delhi's
Mr. Chauncy St. John,

01:37:30.882 --> 01:37:33.044
-- and that's not <i>him.</i>
-- What are we doing tonight?

01:37:33.117 --> 01:37:35.211
-- <i>Nothing. Yeah.</i>
-- <i>Really?</i>

01:37:35.286 --> 01:37:36.720
-- <i>Dinner? Late movie?</i>
-- No. No.

01:37:36.788 --> 01:37:38.085
You want to rent some porn?

01:37:38.156 --> 01:37:40.352
-- Natalie, we can't go out tonight.
-- Why?

01:37:40.425 --> 01:37:41.483
'Cause we're not
going out anymore.

01:37:41.559 --> 01:37:42.856
That doesn't mean
we can't go out anymore.

01:37:42.927 --> 01:37:45.362
-- It sort of does. I'm just trying
to get over it. -- Jeremy...

01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:47.194
-- Get over it. No, I'm
saying get over it. -- Yes.

01:37:47.265 --> 01:37:49.495
I'm trying. I know it's
been all of three weeks.

01:37:49.567 --> 01:37:51.661
I'll see if I can speed up
my nervous breakdown.

01:37:51.736 --> 01:37:54.262
-- Nobody's rushing you.
-- I appreciate it.

01:37:54.338 --> 01:37:55.669
Are you over it yet?

01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:57.970
-- Natalie...
-- How 'bout now?

01:37:58.042 --> 01:37:59.407
<i>Dan: Hey, look.</i>

01:37:59.477 --> 01:38:01.309
-- What's that?
-- It's an abacus.

01:38:01.379 --> 01:38:03.245
-- Excellent.
-- An antique abacus.

01:38:03.314 --> 01:38:04.975
Probably the only kind
there are.

01:38:05.049 --> 01:38:08.019
I got it in Chinatown at a place
called Dang Luck. Isn't it great?

01:38:08.086 --> 01:38:10.851
-- It's wrapped. -- If you could
see it, you'd think it was great.

01:38:10.922 --> 01:38:13.516
-- Dan's Mr. Happy Guy. -- Yes, <i>I</i> am.
-- I can see.

01:38:13.591 --> 01:38:15.650
-- It's an abacus.
-- So you <i>said.</i>

01:38:15.726 --> 01:38:17.353
She's a market analyst --
numbers, arithmetic.

01:38:17.428 --> 01:38:19.726
You know, if she opens up a new
checking account on the corner,

01:38:19.797 --> 01:38:21.094
they'll give her
a free calculator.

01:38:21.165 --> 01:38:25.602
-- Natalie, I'm not sitting on the sidelines
anymore. I'm getting in the game. -- Yes.

01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:28.503
If Steve Sisco wants his wife
back, the road goes through me.

01:38:28.573 --> 01:38:29.506
I love it.

01:38:29.574 --> 01:38:32.703
-- Tonight Rebecca's getting an antique
abacus from Dang Luck. -- Yes!

01:38:32.777 --> 01:38:34.108
-- What am I, crazy?
-- No.

01:38:34.178 --> 01:38:35.270
-- Am I Mr. Crazy Guy?
-- No.

01:38:35.346 --> 01:38:36.609
-- I am. I'm crazy.
-- You're not.

01:38:36.681 --> 01:38:38.046
-- Crazy in love?
-- No, just crazy.

01:38:38.116 --> 01:38:40.050
What is this, an abac--
What is that? Is it cute?

01:38:40.118 --> 01:38:41.552
-- It's cute.
-- It's a little cute.

01:38:41.619 --> 01:38:45.681
-- Natalie, just -- -- What market analyst
wouldn't love an antique abacus from Dang Luck?

01:38:47.692 --> 01:38:48.853
Honesty --

01:38:48.926 --> 01:38:50.894
honesty and directness
are what's required.

01:38:50.962 --> 01:38:55.024
I love her. It's that simple.
Honesty will win the day.

01:38:55.099 --> 01:38:56.328
Thank you.

01:38:57.768 --> 01:39:00.066
I'm talking
about really good porn.

01:39:00.138 --> 01:39:02.607
-- Natalie...
-- Let's work.

01:39:06.711 --> 01:39:08.577
[Keyboard clicking]

01:39:08.646 --> 01:39:09.841
-- Hi.
-- Hey.

01:39:09.914 --> 01:39:12.144
-- Couple of notes?
-- Fire.

01:39:12.216 --> 01:39:14.651
-- 10 seconds less on the
Arizona bullpen. -- Done.

01:39:14.719 --> 01:39:18.155
-- VVrite a shorter intro for the S.O.T.
on the amateur draft. -- Done.

01:39:18.222 --> 01:39:20.122
Stop making Jerry Falwell jokes
on the air.

01:39:20.191 --> 01:39:21.488
-- No.
-- Yes.

01:39:21.559 --> 01:39:23.152
I don't do
Jerry Falwell <i>jokes.</i>

01:39:23.227 --> 01:39:25.389
The asides, the drop-ins --
I am telling you, stop it.

01:39:25.463 --> 01:39:27.932
A week ago today, somebody
threatened to blow up the building

01:39:27.999 --> 01:39:29.592
and all the people in it,
including me.

01:39:29.667 --> 01:39:30.828
And you think
it was Jerry Falwell?

01:39:30.902 --> 01:39:33.234
-- I haven't ruled him out as a suspect.
-- I'm serious!

01:39:33.304 --> 01:39:35.432
-- What are you afraid of?
-- Offending people.

01:39:35.506 --> 01:39:37.998
VVho? Our legions of viewers who
take Jerry Falwell seriously?

01:39:38.075 --> 01:39:39.338
Charo's got
a bigger fan base.

01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:42.243
-- Casey... -- No, I-l
know I'm alone on this.

01:39:42.313 --> 01:39:44.247
I know the vast majority
of people

01:39:44.315 --> 01:39:47.410
consider Jerry Falwell a spiritual
pillar of great and gentle wisdom.

01:39:47.485 --> 01:39:50.420
I know that most people consider
him a scholarly and tolerant man

01:39:50.488 --> 01:39:52.149
who would never judge
others harshly

01:39:52.223 --> 01:39:53.782
just because
they were different.

01:39:53.858 --> 01:39:56.225
I know that most people
find his calm leadership

01:39:56.294 --> 01:39:59.525
to be a gentle, soothing beacon
in a time of great social chaos.

01:39:59.597 --> 01:40:02.794
His guidance, for instance, on the
great purple Teletubby matter

01:40:02.867 --> 01:40:06.735
was fraught with the kind of theological
sophistication that only Jerry Falwell

01:40:06.804 --> 01:40:09.296
and a cafeteria full of
sixth-graders could devise.

01:40:09.373 --> 01:40:11.000
I know I'm going
way out on a limb,

01:40:11.075 --> 01:40:12.804
but I think
Jerry Falwell's a fat-ass.

01:40:14.045 --> 01:40:16.980
Who did I just offend?
I'm eager to talk to them.

01:40:17.048 --> 01:40:20.382
I have a typewriter, and I
will use it as I see fit.

01:40:20.451 --> 01:40:22.647
-- Not on my show.
-- Dana, they're just jokes.

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:24.552
-- Do other jokes.
-- What's with you?

01:40:24.622 --> 01:40:26.283
Not on my show, Casey.

01:40:26.357 --> 01:40:27.825
-- Is this it? You're gonna bench me?
-- Yes. Absolutely.

01:40:27.892 --> 01:40:28.825
Say it.

01:40:28.893 --> 01:40:31.055
Do another Falwell joke,
and you're suspended for a week!

01:40:31.128 --> 01:40:33.688
<i>Kim: Five minutes to air. First
team in the studio, please.</i>

01:40:33.764 --> 01:40:36.233
Casey, the --

01:40:41.138 --> 01:40:42.367
-- Hey, Rebecca.
-- Hi, Jeremy.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.839

-- They said he's on the air in five
minutes. Of course. -- I'll go get him.

01:40:47.912 --> 01:40:49.846
He should be concentrating on the show.
Don't tell him I'm here.

01:40:49.914 --> 01:40:52.713
-- He'd kill me. He's very excited to
see you. -- Jeremy...l know, but --

01:40:52.783 --> 01:40:54.148
They're in extra innings
in Pittsburgh.

01:40:54.218 --> 01:40:55.379
I'll feed it to Casey
in the 20s.

01:40:55.453 --> 01:40:57.182
What were you gonna say?

01:40:57.255 --> 01:40:59.223
-- Nothing.

Good show!

-- <i>You're early!</i>
-- <i>We hit the jet stream.</i>

01:41:06.631 --> 01:41:08.326
-- Oh, I love the jet stream.
-- Yes!

01:41:08.399 --> 01:41:10.197
I want you to know I would kiss
you right now full on the lips,

01:41:10.268 --> 01:41:11.702
but there are people around
and it's unprofessional.

01:41:11.769 --> 01:41:13.669
" Leave, people!

01:41:13.738 --> 01:41:15.536

01:41:27.184 --> 01:41:28.345

01:41:30.421 --> 01:41:32.082

<i>Jeremy: Dan...</i>

01:41:33.491 --> 01:41:34.686

-- Good show.
-- <i>Good show.</i>

01:41:37.028 --> 01:41:38.325
I've got a hot tip for you.

01:41:38.396 --> 01:41:40.694
I heard some people talking on
the plane about Barry Bonds,

01:41:40.765 --> 01:41:42.255
who plays for
the San Diego Giants --

01:41:42.333 --> 01:41:43.459
San Francisco Giants.

01:41:43.534 --> 01:41:45.593
-- Right. They said he's good.
-- What about him?

01:41:45.670 --> 01:41:47.502
-- He <i>is</i> good. -- They say the San
Francisco Giants are gonna be a good team.

01:41:47.571 --> 01:41:50.131
-- They will, but not this year.
-- What about Barry Bonds?

01:41:50.207 --> 01:41:52.005
Unfortunately, the rules
prohibit Barry Bonds

01:41:52.076 --> 01:41:53.703
from batting
before and after himself,

01:41:53.778 --> 01:41:56.475
and he probably can't play right
field and pitch at the same time.

01:42:03.454 --> 01:42:04.785
Uh-oh.

01:42:06.324 --> 01:42:08.759
Yeah.

01:42:08.826 --> 01:42:10.624
Going back to Steve?

01:42:10.695 --> 01:42:12.789
He's my husband.

01:42:12.863 --> 01:42:14.922
-- I want you to know --
-- It's okay.

01:42:14.999 --> 01:42:17.696
-- No, I have to tell you that y-you
just -- -- Don't worry about it.

01:42:19.437 --> 01:42:20.871

Tell him hi.

01:42:40.691 --> 01:42:42.250
These people
really seemed to think

01:42:42.326 --> 01:42:44.658
the Giants were gonna go
all the way this year.

01:42:46.130 --> 01:42:47.461
They're wrong.

with your head?

01:43:47.024 --> 01:43:48.753
-- Well, I was signaling you.
-- Signaling me what?

01:43:48.826 --> 01:43:50.316
That we should go
someplace private.

01:43:50.394 --> 01:43:52.226
Okay. But don't do
that thing with your head.

01:43:52.296 --> 01:43:53.786
Are you gonna suspend me
for a week?

01:43:53.864 --> 01:43:56.424
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
I'm sorry about that.

01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:58.594
That was a very big gun

Well, I was surprised by it.

01:44:11.315 --> 01:44:12.874

gonna ask me to marry him.
