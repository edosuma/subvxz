00:03.171 --> 00:06.074
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.209
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.242 --> 00:10.044
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.078 --> 00:11.512
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.545 --> 00:13.614
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.647 --> 00:17.385
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.688
>> YOU ARE SO HOT.
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

00:20.721 --> 00:24.358
WE JUST MET.
>> I HAVE EYES, DON'T I?

00:24.392 --> 00:26.160
>> WELL, WHAT ELSE
DO YOU HAVE?

00:26.194 --> 00:29.063
>> OHO, EVERYTHING YOU NEED.
OH. TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.798

00:30.831 --> 00:33.634

PAY-PER-VIEW AND MY TV

00:36.570 --> 00:38.072
AND MY FRIGGIN' COUCH.

00:38.106 --> 00:40.808
>> FINE.
HERE'S 20 BUCKS.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.810
>> KEEP IT.
YOU'RE MOVING OUT...NOW.

00:42.843 --> 00:46.214
>> YOU WANT ME OUT OF HERE,
ASS WAD?

00:46.247 --> 00:48.816
MAKE ME.

00:48.849 --> 00:52.520
[scoffs]
THOUGHT SO.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.288
>> GET YOUR ASS
OUT THAT DOOR, STAN,

00:54.322 --> 00:55.623
WHOLE OR IN PIECES,
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

00:55.656 --> 00:59.727
>> I SAID I AIN'T GOIN'--
[gunshot]

01:02.130 --> 01:06.200
YOU SHOT ME?
>> HOW?

01:06.234 --> 01:08.769
>> HEY, CLEAR A PATH, PEOPLE!
SVU'S ON THE SCENE.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.571
>> AND YOU ARE?
>> SORRY, DALE STUCKEY.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.572
UH, NEW CSU TECH.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.407
NOT THAT I WANT TO BE
CSU FOREVER, YOU KNOW.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.143
BUT, UH, HEY, DON'T WORRY,

01:15.176 --> 01:17.378
NOT GUNNING FOR EITHER
OF YOUR JOBS...YET.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.181
>> ALL RIGHT, WHY--WHY DON'T WE
JUST START WITH THE CRIME SCENE.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.749
>> YEAH, APARTMENT 110
RIGHT HERE.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.617
>> UH, DIDN'T DISPATCH SAY
THAT THE CALL CAME

01:23.651 --> 01:25.219
FROM APARTMENT 112?

01:25.253 --> 01:26.086
>> THAT'S JUST
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.222
THE, UH, BULLET
WENT THROUGH THE WALL.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.391
KILLED THE GUY NEXT DOOR.
COOL, HUH?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.426
ANYWAYS, SLUG CAME
FROM IN THERE

01:32.460 --> 01:36.430
WHERE THE, UH,
REAL ACTION IS.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.832
>> SO I SEE YOU'VE MET
OUR NEW TECH.

01:38.866 --> 01:39.833
>> AND HOW.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.535
>> ALL PRETTY OBVIOUS
WHAT HAPPENED, RIGHT?

01:41.569 --> 01:44.172
I MEAN, RAPE, MURDER, SUICIDE.
BING, BANG, BONG.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.406
>> DALE, THANKS.
I THINK WE GOT IT FROM HERE.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.640
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.776
SO I OVERHEARD THE NEIGHBOR
SAYING THAT HE SAW MR. REYES--

01:48.809 --> 01:50.344
THAT'S OUR MALE DECEASED--
AND MS. FLORES--

01:50.378 --> 01:52.213
THE ONE ON THE BED--
COMING HOME EARLIER.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.647
SO, UH, I'M THINKING
THAT THEY WENT OUT,

01:53.681 --> 01:55.849
HAD A FEW TOO MANY,
CAME HOME, ARGUED.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.618
HE ATTACKED HER,
KILLED HER,

01:57.651 --> 02:00.388
REALIZED WHAT HE'S DONE,
[clicks tongue] OFFED HIMSELF.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.190
>> YOU GOT IT ALL
FIGURED OUT, DON'T YOU?

02:02.223 --> 02:04.558
>> SOME CASES SOLVE
THEMSELVES, RIGHT?

02:04.592 --> 02:06.160
HEY, WHAT NOW,
WE ALL GOING TO DISNEYLAND?

02:06.194 --> 02:09.163
>> HEY, LET'S NOT PACK
OUR BAGS JUST YET.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.399
DALE, HOW TALL WOULD YOU SAY
THAT OUR VICTIMS ARE?

02:11.432 --> 02:14.368
>> WELL, JUST EYEBALLING,
I'D SAYING SHE'S ABOUT 5'1".

02:14.402 --> 02:16.237
HE'S 5'6", TOPS.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.872
>> SO WHICH ONE'S HEAD
MADE THIS HOLE IN THE WALL

02:18.906 --> 02:21.375
ALL THE WAY UP HERE
AT 5'11"?

02:21.409 --> 02:23.244
>> OH.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.412
>> AND THE GUN, DALE--

02:24.445 --> 02:25.913
WHAT HAND DOES OUR DEAD GUY
HAVE IT IN?

02:25.946 --> 02:27.381
>> HIS RIGHT HAND.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.283
>> NOW CHECK OUT THE BELT
IN HIS PANTS.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.219
WHAT SIDE DOES HE HAVE
HIS CELL PHONE CLIPPED TO?

02:31.252 --> 02:35.689
>> LEFT SIDE. CONSISTENT
WITH A LEFT-HANDED PERSON.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.525
>> AS IS THE DIRECTION
THAT HE BUCKLES HIS BELT.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.293
>> WAIT, YOU GUYS THINK
SOMEONE ELSE MURDERED THEM

02:39.327 --> 02:40.428
AND MADE IT LOOK
LIKE A SUICIDE?

02:40.461 --> 02:43.197
>> BING, BANG, BONG.
>> CHECK THIS OUT.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.198
IF THERE WAS A THIRD PERSON,

02:44.232 --> 02:46.967
I'D SAY HE WAITED
FOR THESE TWO INSIDE HERE.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.338
LEFT A NICE EAR PRINT.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.307
>> I GUESS THAT KILLER
DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HE HEARD.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.594
>> WE'RE TRYING TO MATCH
AN EAR PRINT?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.462
>> O'HALLORAN SAYS EVERY EAR
IS PHYSICALLY UNIQUE.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.730
THEY'RE KINDA LIKE
FINGERPRINTS.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.432
>> EUROPE HAS LED THE WAY
IN STANDARDIZING

03:51.465 --> 03:52.900
EAR PRINT IDENTIFICATION.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.935
JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE U.S. CATCHES UP.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.637
>> AND YOU BETTER
HOPE WE DON'T,

03:56.670 --> 03:58.639
'CAUSE THOSE DUMBOS OF YOURS
WILL PROBABLY CONTAMINATE

03:58.672 --> 04:00.308
EVERY CRIME SCENE
WE STEP ON.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.576
>> STILL, WE HAVE NO DATABASE
TO COMPARE IT TO,

04:02.610 --> 04:03.977
SO IT DOESN'T
GET US VERY FAR.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.012
>> GOOD NEWS.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.881
WARNER GOT EPITHELIAL DNA
FROM THE EAR PRINT,

04:07.915 --> 04:10.351
MATCHED IT TO THE SEMEN
FOUND IN TISA.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.352
>> PERP IN THE SYSTEM?

04:11.385 --> 04:12.486
>> THERE'S NO HITS,

04:12.520 --> 04:13.687
BUT IT CONFIRMS
OUR THIRD PARTY THEORY.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.623
OKAY, SO WE KNOW
THE PERP WAS LYING IN WAIT

04:15.656 --> 04:16.624
IN THE CLOSET.

04:16.657 --> 04:17.758
DID HE BRING ALONG
THE .45?

04:17.791 --> 04:20.294
>> WE FOUND A CASE AND RECEIPT
IN THE BEDSIDE TABLE.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.329
GUN BELONGED TO TISA.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.063
>> WE GOT THE SCAN STATION
IMAGES.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.534
MY GUESS IS THAT
SHE AND ALEJANDRO

04:26.567 --> 04:27.735
WERE ABOUT TO GET BUSY

04:27.768 --> 04:29.603
WHEN THE PERP JUMPS OUT
OF THE CLOSET.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.605
FIGHT ENSUES.
ALEJANDRO GETS KNOCKED OUT.

04:31.639 --> 04:35.709
NOW TISA GRABS THE GUN,
BUT SHE'S DISARMED, RAPED.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.011
PERP SHOOTS HER,
SHOOTS ALEJANDRO

04:38.045 --> 04:40.614
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
A MURDER-SUICIDE.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.616
>> SO NOW THE QUESTION IS,
WHICH VICTIM

04:42.650 --> 04:44.017
WAS OUR MYSTERY
MALE'S TARGET?

04:44.051 --> 04:46.019
>> WELL, PROBABLY NOT
ALEJANDRO.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.788
HE'S AN ENGINEERING STUDENT.
NO PRIORS.

04:47.821 --> 04:48.989
>> TISA'S NOT SO CLEAN.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.591
SHE WORKS
AT A TAXI DANCE JOINT

04:50.624 --> 04:52.960
ON 215TH AND BROADWAY.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.896
VICE BUSTED IT TWICE
FOR PROSTITUTION.

04:55.929 --> 04:59.500
>> THE EMPIRE DANCE ACADEMY?
>> THAT'S WHAT IT USED TO BE.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.769
IT SOLD IN '07.
SO NO MORE TUTUS.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.537
NOW IT'S TEQUILA
AND TONGUE JOBS.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.706
>> ANY IDEA WHO OWNS
THIS DUMP?

05:05.739 --> 05:08.075
>> BRIDGET SULLOWAY.
822 PARK AVENUE.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.710
>> SOUNDS LIKE A NEW
MAYFLOWER MADAM

05:09.743 --> 05:11.078
SAILED INTO TOWN.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.682
[knock at door]

05:14.715 --> 05:17.017
[door opens]

05:17.050 --> 05:18.486
>> CAN I HELP YOU?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.988
>> WE'RE LOOKING
FOR BRIDGET SULLOWAY.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.756
>> THERE'S NO SOLICITING
IN THIS BUILDING.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.693
>> GOOD. THEY'RE A PAIN
IN THE ASS.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.628
>> THE POLICE.
[clears throat]

05:27.661 --> 05:30.898
I'LL SEE IF SHE'S AVAILABLE.
>> HELLO.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.033
>> BIRDIE.
>> YES, OF COURSE.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.637
I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE
FOR NEW YORK'S FINEST.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.939
SCOOT, CHET, SCOOT.
PLEASE, COME IN.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.541
COME IN. COME IN.
COME IN.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.809
OH, AND CALL ME BIRDIE.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.811
>> BIRDIE,
I'M DETECTIVE STABLER.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.579
MY PARTNER,
DETECTIVE BENSON.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.748
>> HELLO.
>> THIS IS A LOVELY APARTMENT.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.050
>> OH, THANK YOU, DEAR.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.687
IT'S OUR LITTLE PIECE
OF HEAVEN, ISN'T IT, CHET?

05:53.721 --> 05:56.023
>> HMM. I'LL GET
THE MARTINIS.

05:56.056 --> 05:59.560
>> DON'T MIND MY NEPHEW.
HE'S VERY PROTECTIVE OF ME.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.695
MAKES A MEAN MARTINI,
THOUGH.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.097
WOULD YOU CARE FOR ONE?
>> NO, THANK YOU.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.866
BUT YOU COULD TELL US
ABOUT THE PROPERTY YOU OWNED

06:05.899 --> 06:07.835
AT 215TH AND BROADWAY.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.638
>> OH, THAT'S MY OLD
BALLET STUDIO.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.606
>> YOU WERE A DANCER.
>> YES, I WAS.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.708
THANK YOU, DEAR.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:14.742 --> 06:18.612
>> WAS A DANCER, A SINGER,
A LITTLE CABARET HERE AND THERE.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.781
AND THEN WHEN I FOUND OUT
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SELL

06:20.814 --> 06:24.685
MY OLD BUILDING, I ASKED
MY HUSBAND TO BUY IT FOR ME

06:24.718 --> 06:25.986
SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T
GO OUT OF BUSINESS.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.655
MARV'S THE OWNER.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.757
>> NO, BIRDIE,
YOU'RE THE OWNER.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.759
MY ACCOUNTANT HAD ME PUT
THE DEED IN YOUR NAME.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.894
LIABILITY.
AND WHO ARE YOU TWO?

06:33.927 --> 06:36.764
>> NYPD. WE WERE WONDERING
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS IT IS

06:36.797 --> 06:37.898
THAT YOU RUN
IN THAT BUILDING.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.000
>> I TOLD 'EM
IT WAS A BALLET STUDIO.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.102
>> ACTUALLY, THAT PLACE
IS GONE.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.837
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S GONE?

06:43.871 --> 06:45.839
YOU PROMISED ME
THAT YOU'D TAKE CARE OF IT.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.175
>> OH, THE OLD QUEEN WHO RAN IT
COULDN'T PAY THE RENT.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.643
I MEAN, I'M NOT RUNNING
A DAMN CHARITY.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.812
KICKED 'EM OUT.
FOUND SOMEBODY WHO COULD PAY.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.947
>> WHO'S THE CURRENT TENANT?
>> THE BAILARINA ROOM.

06:53.981 --> 06:54.782
SOME CRAPPY CLUB.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.484
FILLS UP WITH MOSTLY
BORDER JUMPERS.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.119
>> MARV.
>> WELL, LATINO, HISPANIC.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.955
THE GUY WHO RUNS IT
CAN HARDLY SPEAK ENGLISH.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.691
AND WHAT HAS THIS GOT TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

07:03.724 --> 07:05.726
>> IT'S GOTTA DO WITH A RAPE
AND DOUBLE HOMICIDE.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.161
ONE OF THE VICTIMS
MAY BE CONNECTED

07:08.195 --> 07:09.229
TO YOUR PROPERTY.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.465
TISA FLORES.
>> DON'T KNOW HER.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.766
>> HOW ABOUT
ALEJANDRO REYES?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.735
>> YOU KNOW, I GOT 30 BUILDINGS
IN THE CITY.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.703
I DON'T KNOW WHO WORKS
IN THEM.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.639
ALL I KNOW IS THAT, UH,
THIS BAILARINA ROOM

07:18.672 --> 07:19.940
DOESN'T OPEN TILL AFTER 9:00.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.643
YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT SOMEBODY
WHO GOT KILLED,

07:22.676 --> 07:24.812
I'D GO ASK THEM.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.582
>> HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN TISA?

07:28.616 --> 07:29.683
>> SIX MONTHS.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.519
SHE'S IN SCHOOL,
BUT HER MOM GOT SICK,

07:31.552 --> 07:33.153
SO SHE STARTED HERE NIGHTS
TO MAKE EXTRA MONEY.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.556
>> BY DANCING WITH MEN.
>> AND SITTING WITH 'EM.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.657
TALKING WITH 'EM.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.826
A LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS
AREN'T TOO GOOD WITH GIRLS.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.194
I MEAN, THEY PAY BY THE MINUTE
JUST TO HANG OUT.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.264
>> IS THAT THE ONLY THING
THAT THEY, UH, PAY FOR?

07:44.297 --> 07:47.801
>> SOME GIRLS TAKE CUSTOMERS
BACK THERE AND, UH, DO MORE.

07:47.835 --> 07:51.004
BUT I AIN'T NO CORNER GIRL.
TISA WASN'T NEITHER.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.006
>> ANY OF THE CUSTOMERS
GET OUT OF LINE?

07:53.040 --> 07:56.677
>> ALL THE TIME.
GUYS WANT MORE OR GET JEALOUS.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.846
TISA KEPT HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH THIS ONE PINGUINITO.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.848
>> LITTLE PENGUIN?
>> THE JEWS.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.183
BLACK PANTS. WHITE SHIRT.
>> ORTHODOX. GOTCHA.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.919
>> WE CALL OVER THERE
THE "SOUTH POLE"

08:05.953 --> 08:08.288
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THE PINGUINITOS HANG OUT.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.758
>> YOU SEE TISA'S
PINGUINITO OVER THERE?

08:10.791 --> 08:13.093
>> NO. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
ALL NIGHT.

08:13.126 --> 08:16.764
LOOK, I-I GOTTA GET
TO WORK.

08:16.797 --> 08:20.233
>> THANKS ANYWAY.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.870
>> THAT'S HIM.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.080
>> HEY, YOU WANNA BUY
A DANCE?

08:33.113 --> 08:34.782
>> I ONLY DANCE
WITH ONE GIRL.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.650
>> TISA, RIGHT?
>> YEAH.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.051
SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.953
>> SO I GUESS YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DANCE WITH ME THEN.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.022
>> WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
>> POLICE.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.824
TURN YOUR HEAD AROUND.
>> WHAT? WHAT IS THAT?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.793
DON'T TOUCH ME!
>> SHH, SHH. ALL RIGHT.

08:45.826 --> 08:46.927
DON'T WANT TO SHOW US
YOUR EAR,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.061
WE'LL TAKE IT DOWNTOWN.

08:48.095 --> 08:51.298
COME ON.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.705
>> I DIDN'T KILL TISA.
I LOVED HER.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.773
>> WELL, THEY--THEY'RE NOT
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.843
>> BESIDES, SHE DIDN'T
LOVE YOU.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.846
>> SHE WOULD'VE.
SHE JUST NEEDED TIME.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.781
>> EFRAIM, FACE IT,

09:07.815 --> 09:09.817
YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER CHECK
ON HER DANCE CARD.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.251
>> I WASN'T LIKE
THOSE LOSERS.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.920
I-I MADE A PICNIC
FOR HER ONCE.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.588
>> GREAT.
I'M GLAD YOU HAD FUN.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.224
BUT THEN WHERE DID SHE GO?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.760
HMM? HOME WITH YOU?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.161
OH, DIDN'T THINK SO.

09:21.194 --> 09:25.866
SHE WENT HOME
TO HER BOYFRIEND.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.868
YOU KNEW SHE HAD
A BOYFRIEND, RIGHT?

09:27.901 --> 09:28.802
A REAL ONE.

09:28.836 --> 09:31.371
>> SHE WAS GONNA BREAK UP
WITH ALEJANDRO.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.873
>> HEY, HE KNOWS HIM
BY NAME.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.808
>> OH, I BET EFRAIM
KNOWS A LOT.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.977
WHERE TISA LIVES,
HOW TO BREAK INTO HER PLACE.

09:37.010 --> 09:37.845
HE DID THAT
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.848
>> I WAS AT HOME
TWO NIGHTS AGO, I SWEAR.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.983
>> HE KNOWS THE THRILL
OF WAITING FOR HER,

09:43.016 --> 09:47.921
KNOWING HOW HAPPY
SHE'LL BE WHEN--

09:47.955 --> 09:50.924
BUT THEN SHE CAME HOME
WITH HIM.

09:50.958 --> 09:51.992
YOU GOT SCARED.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.227
DUCKED INTO THE CLOSET,
LISTENING.

09:54.261 --> 09:58.031
WAITING FOR HIM TO LEAVE,
BUT HE DIDN'T.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.233
I MEAN, MAYBE YOU EVEN
HEARD 'EM STARTING TO HAVE SEX.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.903
IS THAT WHEN YOU SNAPPED?
>> NO!

10:02.936 --> 10:06.339
I NEVER DID ANYTHING MEAN
TO TISA.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.008
EVERYBODY ELSE DID.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.278
ALEJANDRO CRITICIZED HER.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.882
CUSTOMERS TRIED TO MAKE HER
GO BACK TO THE CORNER.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.217
BUT SHE COULDN'T EVEN COMPLAIN
BECAUSE THE HEAD GUY

10:17.250 --> 10:18.418
WAS THE WORST OF ALL.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.921
HE'S THE ONE WHO WAS ALWAYS
AFTER TISA.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.790
>> OKAY, THIS HEAD GUY,
WAS HE THE CLUB'S MANAGER?

10:22.823 --> 10:25.859
>> HIGHER UP.
I THINK HE OWNS THE BUILDING.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.929
[scoffs]
GUY'S A STALKER.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.965
>> LET ME GUESS.
HIS NAME IS MARV.

10:31.999 --> 10:36.670
>> YEAH. HE'S IN THERE
ALL THE TIME.

10:36.704 --> 10:39.406
YOU CAN'T MISS HIM.
WEARS A BIG DIAMOND WATCH.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.409
>> I UNDERSTAND YOU NABBED
OUR L'CHAIM LOVER BOY.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.944
>> YEAH. WRONG GUY.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.979
HE FINALLY LET US TAKE
AN EAR PRINT.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.815
DIDN'T MATCH.
>> SO WE'RE NOWHERE.

10:47.848 --> 10:48.949
>> WELL, NOT REALLY.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.752
EFRAIM POINTED US BACK
TO SOMEBODY VERY INTERESTING.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.186
MARV SULLOWAY.
>> THE LANDLORD.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.689
>> AND BROKE, ACCORDING
TO HIS TAXES.

10:55.723 --> 10:58.959
HE CLAIMS $27,000
ANNUAL INCOME.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.161
AND THIS IS A GUY WHO LIVES
IN A PENTHOUSE ON PARK AVE.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.930
GOTTA BE COOKING
THE BOOKS.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.265
>> IRS THOUGHT SO TOO.
AUDITED HIM THREE TIMES.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.900
NEVER NAILED HIM.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.268
>> WELL, MEANS HE'S SMART
AND HE'S GOT LAWYERS.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.970
SO BEFORE WE TAKE
A RUN AT HIM...

11:10.003 --> 11:11.772
>> MAKE SURE WE GOT
ALL OUR DUCKS IN A ROW.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.041
>> DETECTIVE BENSON.
>> BIRDIE.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.077
>> CAN WE TALK?
IT'S ABOUT MY HUSBAND.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.846
>> YES, OF COURSE.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.181
LET'S, UM, WHY DON'T WE GO OFF
TO THE LOUNGE.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.050
JUST THIS WAY.

11:23.083 --> 11:27.220
I'M SORRY, I MEAN, MARV USUALLY
ISN'T SUCH A BOORISH MAN.

11:27.254 --> 11:32.325
>> [snorts]
>> WHAT'D I TELL YOU, DETECTIVE?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.361
>> HE EVER HAVE TO PROTECT YOU
FROM MARV?

11:34.394 --> 11:36.096
>> PHYSICALLY?
OH, NO.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.765
>> BIRDIE.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.067
>> WELL, MAYBE MARV DRINKS
A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.401
BUT I CAN HOLD MY OWN.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.337
AFTER ALL, I WAS MARRIED
TO FOUR MEN BEFORE HIM.

11:44.371 --> 11:48.341
AND WHEN MY FATHER DIED,
I HAD TO FEND FOR MYSELF.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.043
>> THAT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
EASY IN THIS CITY.

11:50.077 --> 11:53.013
>> ESPECIALLY AS A DANCER.
LOT OF GRABBY PRODUCERS.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.283
WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON
I CAME TODAY.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.820
I UNDERSTAND THAT POOR GIRL
WHO DIED WAS A DANCER.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.021
>> SHE WAS.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.355
>> I WANT TO PAY
FOR HER FUNERAL.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.858
>> UH, BIRDIE, THAT REALLY
ISN'T NECESSARY.

12:04.892 --> 12:09.229
>> OH, YES, IT IS, TO MAKE UP
FOR MY HUSBAND'S CALLOUSNESS.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.531
YECCH, MARV AND HIS
PEN CHEWING.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.134
DID I MENTION HE WAS A PIG?

12:14.167 --> 12:16.770
>> UH, HERE YOU GO.
>> THANK YOU.

12:16.804 --> 12:19.039
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A GOOD MIND
TO MARCH STRAIGHT DOWN

12:19.072 --> 12:21.975
TO CITY HALL
AND FILE DIVORCE PAPERS

12:22.009 --> 12:23.376
ON THAT JACKASS.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.045
>> FINALLY.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.447
>> THIS IS INCREDIBLY GENEROUS
OF YOU.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.549
AND ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
AT LEAST YOUR NEPHEW

12:29.582 --> 12:32.185
WILL ALWAYS BE THERE
FOR YOU.

12:32.219 --> 12:36.289
>> UM, CHET, BE A POODLE
AND GO GET ME A CUP OF TEA.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.992
I SAW A TEAPOT DOWNSTAIRS.

12:39.026 --> 12:42.395
>> TEA.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.232
>> TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
WITH YOU,

12:45.265 --> 12:47.067
HE'S NOT MY NEPHEW.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.002
IT'S A LITTLE GAME
WE PLAY.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.004
SOME YEARS AGO,
I HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.305
SHE WAS A ROCKETTE.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.475
AND SHE GAVE BIRTH TO CHET
OUT OF WEDLOCK.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.145
SHE DIED WHEN HE WAS SIX,
AND I TOOK HIM IN.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.947
AND HE'S BEEN WITH ME
EVER SINCE.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.348
>> WELL, HE'S A VERY
LUCKY MAN.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.483
>> I'M THE LUCKY ONE.

13:03.516 --> 13:08.088
CHET'S THE ONLY PERSON
WHO'S EVER REALLY LOVED ME.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.823
SOMETIMES I THINK
MY REAL TALENT

13:09.857 --> 13:12.192
IS IN ATTRACTING BAD MEN.

13:12.225 --> 13:15.395
>> GOOD ONES ARE HARD TO FIND.
>> I PICKED SOME DOOZIES THOUGH.

13:15.428 --> 13:19.066
THE FIRST ONE
WAS A DRUG DEALER.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.102
THE SECOND ONE
LIKED LITTLE BOYS.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.404
MY THIRD HUSBAND,
PHILIP, HE--

13:24.437 --> 13:26.339
HE MAY HAVE BEEN NICE,
I DON'T KNOW.

13:26.373 --> 13:30.410
>> SHORT MARRIAGE?
>> ALL OF FOUR DAYS.

13:30.443 --> 13:34.114
WE WERE SAILING TO BERMUDA
FOR OUR HONEYMOON.

13:34.147 --> 13:38.952
A FREAK STORM CAME UP,
AND HE WAS SWEPT OVERBOARD.

13:38.986 --> 13:43.356
AND THE ONE AFTER PHILIP
WAS A WOMANIZER.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.159
AND NOW HERE'S MARV.

13:46.193 --> 13:49.229
BUT I SWEAR, HE WAS FUNNY
AND CHARMING

13:49.262 --> 13:52.565
WHEN I FIRST MET HIM.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.302
THEN LAST NIGHT,
AFTER HE WENT TO BED,

13:55.335 --> 13:59.106
I SNEAKED INTO HIS OFFICE
AND I LOOKED THROUGH HIS FILES.

13:59.139 --> 14:02.109
I FOUND OUT
THAT THE PROPERTIES HE OWNED

14:02.142 --> 14:05.145
WERE ALL STRIP CLUBS
AND PEEP JOINTS

14:05.178 --> 14:07.080
AND HORRIBLE PLACES.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.082
>> YOU HAD NO IDEA
THAT HE'D BEEN LYING TO YOU?

14:09.116 --> 14:12.485
THERE WAS NO OTHER
SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR?

14:12.519 --> 14:15.255
>> NONE WHATSOEVER.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.091
>> HERE'S YOUR TEA, BIRDIE.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.593
>> OH, THANK YOU, CHET.
THANK YOU.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.129
OH, LET ME GET RID
OF THAT THING.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.231
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'LL DISPOSE OF IT.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.533
>> THANKS AGAIN.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.068
>> YOU'RE KIDDING.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.437
YOU'RE REALLY TELLING ME
THAT MARV SULLOWAY'S DNA

14:30.470 --> 14:31.604
IS ON THIS?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.206
>> LURKING IN A CRUSTY COAT
OF SLOBBER.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.474
>> SO IF WARNER RUNS IT
AND SAYS IT'S A MATCH

14:34.507 --> 14:36.309
FOR THE SEMEN FOUND
INSIDE TISA?

14:36.343 --> 14:39.146
>> YOU HAVE MY BLESSINGS
TO NAIL THE SON OF A BITCH.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.118
>> I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THE LOOK ON THIS A-HOLE'S FACE.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.653
>> DO ME A FAVOR.
LET ME CUFF HIM.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.156
>> BETTER YET,
LET BIRDIE DO IT.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.558
>> [screams]

14:51.591 --> 14:55.262
[car alarm blaring,
horn honking]

14:59.232 --> 15:01.468
>> IT'S MARV.
>> OH, MY GOD.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.304
I LOOKED UP
JUST AS HE JUMPED.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.572
[knocking at door]

15:05.605 --> 15:09.142
>> OH, DETECTIVES,
DID YOU DECIDE TO TRY

15:09.176 --> 15:11.278
THE MARTINIS AFTER ALL?

15:11.311 --> 15:13.313
>> WHERE ARE
MR. AND MRS. SULLOWAY?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.148
>> MARV IS IN THE STUDY
AND BIRDIE HAS RETIRED

15:15.182 --> 15:16.283
FOR THE EVENING, WHY?

15:16.316 --> 15:20.087
>> ALL RIGHT, CHET, YOU AND I
ARE GONNA TALK IN THERE.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.394
[accordion muisc playing]

15:27.427 --> 15:35.435
*

15:39.639 --> 15:42.175
>> BIRDIE.

15:42.209 --> 15:46.146
>> YOU RECOGNIZE HER?

15:51.351 --> 15:55.188
SHE'S WHO I USED TO BE.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.369
>> DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?
DID YOU FIND A NOTE?

16:09.402 --> 16:12.139
>> NOTHING ON PAPER
OR HIS COMPUTER.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.607
>> DID MARV SAY ANYTHING
UNUSUAL EARLIER

16:14.641 --> 16:16.676
OR--OR SEEM DESPONDENT?

16:16.709 --> 16:20.380
>> NO. NO.
I DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK TO HIM.

16:20.413 --> 16:25.218
I WAS GOING TO CALL A DIVORCE
LAWYER IN THE MORNING.

16:25.252 --> 16:28.121
>> HE SEEMED NORMAL TO ME.
HE CAME HOME.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.257
HE TOOK HIS MARTINI
AND HE WENT INTO THE OFFICE.

16:30.290 --> 16:34.727
AND I ASSUME THAT HE WAS DOING
WHAT HE ALWAYS DOES.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.729
SURF PORN.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.132
>> UH, DETECTIVES.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.235
>> OHH. WILL YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT?

16:42.269 --> 16:43.703
>> WHAT DO YOU GOT,
DALE?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.305
>> WELL, I WANTED TO BE
MORE THOROUGH

16:45.338 --> 16:46.506
LIKE YOU SHOWED ME
THE OTHER DAY,

16:46.539 --> 16:48.608
SO I DUSTED
THE OPEN WINDOW.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.411
NOW, ODDS ARE A JUMPER
WOULD'VE FACED IT,

16:51.444 --> 16:54.247
GRABBED THE SIDES,
STEPPED UP ONTO THE SILL

16:54.281 --> 16:58.285
SO HIS THUMBPRINTS WOULD BE
FACING UPWARDS IN THE FRAME.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.253
>> EXCEPT THAT THEY'RE
POINTING DOWNWARD

17:00.287 --> 17:01.421
LIKE HE HAD HIS BACK
AGAINST THE WINDOW.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.690
>> TRYING NOT TO GO OUT.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.793
>> I THINK OUR CASE JUST WENT
FROM SUICIDE TO MURDER.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.528
BING, BANG, BONG.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.402
>> WHY DO WE NEED
TO COME IN?

17:15.435 --> 17:16.703
>> SO OUR CSU TECHS
CAN FINISH THEIR WORK.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.071
BESIDES,
WE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS

17:18.105 --> 17:19.306
SO WE UNDERSTAND
THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.773
>> IN OTHER WORDS,
THE USUAL PAPERWORK.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.710
>> MRS. SULLOWAY,
I'M CAPTAIN CRAGEN.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.145
I'M VERY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.813
>> THANK YOU.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.149
>> JOHN, WHY DON'T YOU ESCORT
HER TO THE INTERVIEW ROOM.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.783
AND, FIN, TAKE CHET
TO MY OFFICE.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.253
>> YOU--YOU'RE SPLITTING US UP?
>> OH, IT'S NOT FOR LONG.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.222
SHE JUST NEEDS TO SIGN
SOME FORMS

17:35.255 --> 17:37.124
FOR THE RELEASE
OF MR. SULLOWAY'S BODY.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.558
>> DEAR, DON'T MAKE
A FUSS.

17:38.591 --> 17:41.761
>> OKAY.
>> AFTER YOU, JOHN.

17:41.794 --> 17:46.766
>> RIGHT THIS WAY.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.501
>> WARNER CALLED.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.504
MARV'S EAR PRINT MATCHES
THE ONE INSIDE TISA'S CLOSET.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.340
>> OKAY, SO HE'S OUR KILLER.
CASE CLOSED.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.142
>> NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONE OF THEM

17:55.175 --> 17:56.343
IS OUR KILLER'S KILLER.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.345
>> WELL, THAT'S IF MARV
WAS PUSHED.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.414
>> CAPTAIN, HIS HANDPRINTS
WERE GOING THE WRONG WAY

18:01.448 --> 18:02.849
ON THE WINDOW.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.517
>> WARNER ALSO FOUND
EXCESSIVE AMOUNT

18:04.551 --> 18:07.187
OF TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT
IN MARV'S BLOODSTREAM.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.789
>> SO HE WAS DRUGGED.
>> OR HE DRUGGED HIMSELF.

18:09.822 --> 18:13.126
IF WE'RE WRONG AND MARV STUMBLED
AND FELL OUT OF THE WINDOW,

18:13.160 --> 18:15.495
WE DON'T WANT TO TRAUMATIZE
AN ALREADY GRIEVING WIDOW.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.665
>> AGAIN, THANK YOU
FOR COMING IN.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.400
I KNOW THIS IS
A DIFFICULT TIME.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.802
>> [sighs] WELL, IT HASN'T
QUITE HIT ME YET.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.372
>> I UNDERSTAND. MAY I?
>> OH, THANK YOU.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.439
>> MM-HMM.

18:26.473 --> 18:30.643
>> THERE ARE SO FEW GENTLEMEN
LEFT IN THE WORLD.

18:30.677 --> 18:34.681
>> MRS. SULLOWAY,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

18:34.714 --> 18:36.483
WHY YOUR HUSBAND WANTED
TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE?

18:36.516 --> 18:38.351
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

18:38.385 --> 18:41.254
>> HE HADN'T MENTIONED SUICIDE
OR BEING DEPRESSED LATELY?

18:41.288 --> 18:43.623
>> NO. NO, NOT AT ALL.

18:43.656 --> 18:49.329
BUT THEN AGAIN, MARV WAS NEVER
THE MOST EXPRESSIVE MAN.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.531
USED TO BE
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.367
HE EVEN WROTE ME POETRY.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.303
BUT, WELL,
THE LAST FEW YEARS,

18:56.336 --> 18:58.505
WE HAVEN'T BEEN EXACTLY
CONFIDANTS.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.473
>> MM-HMM.
LIKE YOU AND CHET ARE.

19:00.507 --> 19:05.678
>> CHET AND I ARE SPECIAL.
>> THINK MARV WAS JEALOUS?

19:05.712 --> 19:08.548
>> JEALOUS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS
MANY DELIGHTFUL QUALITIES.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.918
JEALOUS, IRRATIONAL,
UM, ALCOHOLIC,

19:11.951 --> 19:14.321
RAGE-AHOLIC, PORN ADDICT.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.555
>> WHAT ABOUT DRUGS?

19:15.588 --> 19:17.890
>> I WAS, UH, I WAS JUST
HIS BARTENDER.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.960
BUT BIRDIE MIGHT KNOW
IF HE WAS POPPING PILLS.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.364
>> LIPITOR, ZANTAC, AND, UM,
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.600
I THINK, UM, UH, DOXEPIN.
DOXEPIN?

19:27.634 --> 19:31.271
>> THAT'S AN ANTIDEPRESSANT.
>> IS IT?

19:31.304 --> 19:32.505
WELL, I JUST REMEMBER CHET

19:32.539 --> 19:35.508
GOING THROUGH MARV'S
MEDICINE CABINET ONE DAY

19:35.542 --> 19:39.546
AND LAUGHING LIKE HELL
OVER ALL THE NAMES

19:39.579 --> 19:43.316
AND COUNTING OUT ALL THE POISONS
THAT THE OLD MAN HAD TO TAKE.

19:43.350 --> 19:47.687
>> POISONS.
>> IT'S WHAT I CALL 'EM.

19:47.720 --> 19:52.492
WHEN I WAS NINE, MY FATHER
WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.295
THEY SAID
IT WAS NOTHING SERIOUS.

19:55.328 --> 19:59.466
A KIDNEY STONE.
SAID HE'D BE HOME THE NEXT DAY.

19:59.499 --> 20:04.304
ONLY HE WASN'T.
THEY KILLED HIM.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.574
AND I WAS LEFT ALL ALONE.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.908
[sniffs]

20:08.941 --> 20:12.512
>> I'M SORRY.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.349
>> THANK YOU.
[sniffs] OH.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.986
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THAT
MY FATHER WAS A VERY NICE MAN.

20:20.019 --> 20:23.623
SOME WAYS, HE WAS A LOT
LIKE MARV, THE BASTARD.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.792
>> STILL, NO CHILD DESERVES
TO BE AN ORPHAN.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.795
>> NO. YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:28.828 --> 20:32.632
AND THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED
THEN AND THERE

20:32.665 --> 20:36.803
THAT ALL DOCTORS ARE NOTHING
BUT WELL-PAID MURDERERS.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.506
TO HELL WITH 'EM.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.808
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T BEEN TO ONE
OR TOUCHED A PILL BOTTLE

20:41.841 --> 20:43.743
IN 60 YEARS.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.547
>> SO YOU DON'T KNOW IF MARV
WAS REGULARLY TAKING TRICYCLICS.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.616
>> WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

20:49.649 --> 20:54.487
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE
THAN WHAT I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.389
>> [laughs] I KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.724
I AM HER SOUL MATE.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.559
>> THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
SO PROTECTIVE OF HER.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.627
>> EXACTLY.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.661
>> SO WHEN IS THE LAST TIME

21:01.694 --> 21:02.729
THAT YOU HAD TO PROTECT HER?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.364
>> OH, THAT WOULD BE
TWO DAYS AGO

21:04.397 --> 21:05.998
WHEN YOU AND YOUR PARTNER
CAME BY.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.600
MARV WENT MENTAL.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.402
HE WAS SLAMMING DOORS

21:09.436 --> 21:11.338
AND HE WAS SWEATING
THROUGH HIS SHIRT.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.506
AND BIRDIE ASKED HIM--
SHE SAID, "WHAT IS WRONG?"

21:13.540 --> 21:14.674
AND HE STARTED
TO SCREAM AT HER.

21:14.707 --> 21:18.010
SO I SAID TO HIM,
"YOU LEAVE HER ALONE!"

21:18.044 --> 21:22.482
AND HE LUNGED AT ME
LIKE THIS CRAZY ANIMAL.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.983
AND THEN HE--HE BOLTED
FOR THE DOOR.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.085
THAT MAN WAS IN TROUBLE.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.455
>> CHET, WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THAT MARV SULLOWAY

21:28.488 --> 21:30.757
WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION
FOR MURDER?

21:30.790 --> 21:34.694
>> [laughs]
YOU'RE JOKING.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.629
>> THE DANCER THAT HE CLAIMED
NOT TO KNOW,

21:36.663 --> 21:38.898
HE MURDERED HER
AND HER BOYFRIEND.

21:38.931 --> 21:43.770
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.672
AND TO THINK THAT BIRDIE
WAS MARRIED TO THE MAN FOR...

21:45.705 --> 21:48.741
>> FOR 11 YEARS.
>> GOOD ONES?

21:48.775 --> 21:50.443
>> HA.

21:50.477 --> 21:53.112
WELL, I SEE YOU'RE MARRIED.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.048
SO YOU MUST KNOW
THEY'RE NOT ALL GOOD.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.585
>> RIGHT. DO YOU THINK MARV
WAS HAPPY?

21:58.618 --> 22:01.688
>> WELL,
I-I DON'T THINK HE KNEW

22:01.721 --> 22:03.623
THAT I WAS CONTEMPLATING
DIVORCE.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.558
>> BUT YOU HAD SEPARATE
BEDROOMS.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.760
>> MARV WAS A SNORER.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.497
>> AND CHET?

22:10.530 --> 22:16.636
>> CHET?
CHET SLEEPS LIKE A BABY.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.506
>> I MEANT, HOW DID HE FEEL
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND?

22:19.539 --> 22:21.708
>> I HATED THE MAN
EVEN MORE THAN HE HATED ME.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.142
>> DO YOU THINK HE WAS
THREATENED BY YOU?

22:23.175 --> 22:24.511
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:24.544 --> 22:26.613
>> BY YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH BIRDIE.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.080
YOU JUST SAID THAT THE TWO
OF YOU WERE SOUL MATES.

22:28.114 --> 22:31.083
>> I'VE BEEN BY HER SIDE
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.885
>> RIGHT. SO IT COULDN'T
HAVE THRILLED MARV TOO MUCH

22:32.919 --> 22:35.488
TO ALWAYS HAVE THE NEPHEW
TAGGING ALONG.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.790
>> I-I-I DON'T CARE
WHAT HE THINKS,

22:37.824 --> 22:42.795
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU SAID
WHAT HE DID TO THOSE PEOPLE.

22:42.829 --> 22:45.698
I MEAN, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
HE WAS HAVING AFFAIRS,

22:45.732 --> 22:48.735
THOUGH GOD KNOWS WHAT WOMAN
COULD TOLERATE THAT MAN.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.404
>> BIRDIE DID.
>> BLESS HER HEART.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.706
SHE'S A VERY
SPECIAL PERSON.

22:53.740 --> 22:57.644
>> AND YOU TWO HAVE A VERY
SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.646
>> YES.
>> MM-HMM.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.180
HOW SPECIAL, CHET?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.682
>> EXCUSE ME?
>> COME ON.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.084
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN.
YOU HAVE NEEDS.

23:05.117 --> 23:08.020
>> [chuckles] I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.422
>> AND BIRDIE
ISN'T REALLY YOUR AUNT.

23:09.456 --> 23:13.460
SO HOW SPECIAL IS IT?

23:13.493 --> 23:16.796
>> CHET WAS 18
WHEN WE FIRST MADE LOVE.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.898
I SUPPOSE YOU FIND
THAT SHOCKING.

23:18.931 --> 23:23.102
BUT OUR RELATIONSHIP
HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY INTIMATE.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.704
>> SO BEING PHYSICAL
JUST MADE SENSE.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.740
>> WELL, YES.
HE WAS A SENSITIVE YOUNG MAN.

23:27.774 --> 23:30.843
HE NEEDED GUIDANCE.

23:30.877 --> 23:33.179
AND I LOVE HIM.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.848
I LOVE HIM MORE
THAN ANYONE I'VE EVER KNOWN.

23:35.882 --> 23:39.852
>> SO WHY NOT GET MARRIED?

23:39.886 --> 23:42.622
>> WELL, I THINK
OUR AGE DIFFERENCE

23:42.655 --> 23:47.894
MIGHT STRIKE SOME PEOPLE
AS, UH, UNSEEMLY.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.797
BUT I DID LOVE
MY HUSBANDS.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.999
TILL I FOUND OUT WHAT KIND
OF MEN THEY REALLY WERE.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.667
>> AND THEN IT WAS BACK
TO CHET.

23:54.701 --> 23:56.803
>> I'D DO ANYTHING FOR HIM

23:56.836 --> 23:58.871
AND HE'D DO ANYTHING
FOR ME.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.474
>> LIKE KILL YOUR HUSBAND?
>> WHAT?

24:01.508 --> 24:03.576
>> WELL, YOU KNOW,
MARV WAS A DANGEROUS MAN.

24:03.610 --> 24:04.977
WE JUST GOT PROOF
THAT HE MURDERED

24:05.011 --> 24:08.080
THOSE TWO PEOPLE
FROM HIS CLUB.

24:08.114 --> 24:12.151
>> OH. OH.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.120
>> YOU DON'T SEEM SURPRISED.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.756
>> NOTHING SURPRISES ME
ABOUT THAT MAN.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.725
>> ALL THE MORE REASON
THAT CHET WOULD DO ANYTHING

24:18.758 --> 24:20.560
TO PROTECT YOU FROM HIM.

24:20.593 --> 24:24.230
>> UN-UH.
MY CHET IS VERY KIND.

24:24.263 --> 24:28.801
VERY GENTLE.
HE COULD NEVER HURT ANYONE.

24:28.835 --> 24:32.071
>> MARV SULLOWAY
IS A DISGUSTING,

24:32.104 --> 24:34.173
EGOTISTICAL PIECE OF CRAP,
BUT I DID NOT KILL HIM.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.775
>> WELL, I THINK YOU DID.
>> MM-HMM.

24:35.808 --> 24:36.843
IS THAT WHY YOU BROUGHT ME
IN HERE?

24:36.876 --> 24:39.546
>> I THINK THAT YOU SPIKED
HIS MARTINI LAST NIGHT,

24:39.579 --> 24:40.913
YOU GOT HIM WOOZY,

24:40.947 --> 24:42.181
AND YOU PUSHED HIM OUT
THAT WINDOW.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.083
>> I GAVE HIM
HIS DRINK, YES.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.985
BUT AFTER THAT, I TOLD YOU,
HE WENT INTO HIS OFFICE

24:46.018 --> 24:47.654
TO SURF PORN.

24:47.687 --> 24:48.888
>> OKAY, CHET, YOU SURE
THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED?

24:48.921 --> 24:50.557
>> YES.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.725
>> BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE
AT YOUR APARTMENT RIGHT NOW

24:52.759 --> 24:54.060
COLLECTING EVIDENCE.

24:54.093 --> 24:56.596
EVERY GLASS.
EVERY BOTTLE OF BOOZE.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.230
EVERY PILL BOTTLE.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.867
AND GUESS WHO'S FINGERPRINTS
ARE GONNA BE ON 'EM, CHET.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.969
>> OF COURSE MY PRINTS
ARE ALL OVER THOSE BOTTLES.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.904
I'M THEIR BARTENDER!

25:04.937 --> 25:07.807
>> SO THAT'S
YOUR STORY, HMM?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.976
NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED
AFTER MARV GOT HOME?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.678
>> I HEARD HIM COME IN,
BUT I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

25:11.711 --> 25:12.779
I WAS IN MY ROOM.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.714
>> AND YOU AND CHET
DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONVERSATIONS

25:14.747 --> 25:15.715
ABOUT MARV BEFORE THEN?

25:15.748 --> 25:16.883
>> ABOUT WHAT?

25:16.916 --> 25:20.286
>> MM, PLANS TO DIVORCE.
>> YES.

25:20.319 --> 25:21.621
I DON'T KNOW. PERHAPS.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.823
I-I--YOU KNOW,
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.659
I DON'T REMEMBER, UH,
IF--IF I TOLD HIM

25:26.693 --> 25:28.127
ABOUT SEEING THE LAWYER
IN THE MORNING OR NOT.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.731
>> OKAY, BUT--BUT CHET KNEW
HOW MUCH YOU HATED MARV.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.666
AND SINCE HE WAS THE ONE
POURING THE DRINKS,

25:33.700 --> 25:35.201
HE COULD'VE VERY EASILY
HAVE DRUGGED HIM

25:35.234 --> 25:37.904
WITH ONE OF THOSE, UH,
POISONS.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.572
>> I DON'T KNOW.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.841
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF MARV DRANK LAST NIGHT.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.876
>> OF COURSE MARV DRANK
LAST NIGHT!

25:43.910 --> 25:46.012
MARV DRANK EVERY NIGHT!

25:46.045 --> 25:48.748
>> LAST NIGHT, YOU LACED
HIS GLASS WITH TRICYCLICS.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.082
>> I DID NOT.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.884
>> BUT HE HAD A HUGE AMOUNT
IN HIS SYSTEM.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.252
>> I DON'T, I--
>> 'CAUSE YOU GAVE IT TO HIM.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.587
>> NO, I DIDN'T!

25:54.621 --> 25:55.822
>> WELL, THEN, WHO DID?

25:55.855 --> 25:57.957
>> I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

25:57.990 --> 25:58.991
>> YOU DO.
>> NO.

25:59.025 --> 25:59.826
>> YEAH, YOU DO.
>> NO.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.027
>> YOU DID.
>> NO.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.795
>> YES, YOU DID,
'CAUSE YOU GAVE IT TO HIM!

26:02.829 --> 26:03.830
JUST ADMIT IT!

26:03.863 --> 26:04.931
YOU KILLED MARV!

26:04.964 --> 26:05.965
>> NO, HE DIDN'T!

26:05.998 --> 26:07.033
>> HE KILLED HIM, BIRDIE,
FOR YOU.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.935
>> MY CHET DIDN'T.
HE COULDN'T.

26:08.968 --> 26:09.836
>> HE COULD AND HE DID.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.237
>> I DID NOT!

26:11.270 --> 26:12.939
>> CHET, MARV
DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF!

26:12.972 --> 26:13.806
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.042
HE WAS AN EGOTISTICAL
PIECE OF CRAP.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.912
HE WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU OR
BIRDIE BEFORE HE KILLED HIMSELF.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.348
FOR GOD SAKES, THE MAN
MURDERED TWO PEOPLE.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.050
AND THAT'S WHY YOU
HAD TO STOP HIM.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.384
>> I WANNA TALK TO BIRDIE.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.986
I NEED TO GO SEE HER,
RIGHT NOW.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.255
>> CHET, CHET, CHET.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.690
BIRDIE IS BUSY.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.091
SHE'S BUSY TELLING US
ALL ABOUT YOU.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.893
>> NO, SHE'S NOT!
>> DO YOU WANNA BET!

26:33.926 --> 26:37.997
>> YES!

26:38.030 --> 26:39.899
>> COME HERE, CHET.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.001
LOOK AT HER.

26:42.034 --> 26:42.969
LOOK AT HER.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.872
LOOK AT HER TALKING
TO DETECTIVE STABLER.

26:45.905 --> 26:48.407
COME OVER HERE...
AND LOOK AT HER.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.843
BECAUSE SHE'S TELLING US
EVERYTHING.

26:50.877 --> 26:54.213
SHE'S TELLING US HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE HER.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.983
SHE'S TELLING US
HOW MUCH YOU PROTECT HER.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.084
>> NO!

26:58.117 --> 27:00.687
>> AND SHE IS TELLING US HOW
FREAKED OUT YOU WERE...

27:00.720 --> 27:01.921
>> I WANNA GO!
>> WHEN MARV LOST HER.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.724
>> CAN I GO NOW?
I WANNA GO! PLEASE LET ME GO!

27:04.757 --> 27:07.026
>> I KNOW YOU WANNA GO,
BUT YOU HAD TO KILL MARV,

27:07.059 --> 27:09.829
OR HE WAS GONNA HURT
YOUR SOUL MATE.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.363
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU DRUGGED MARV'S DRINK.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.866
THAT'S WHY YOU PUSHED HIM
OUT THE WINDOW.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.936
LOOK AT HER--BIRDIE'S
TELLING US THE WHOLE STORY.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.972
EVERY SINGLE DETAIL.

27:20.006 --> 27:23.075
>> NO! I DIDN'T DO IT!
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

27:23.109 --> 27:27.446
SHE--SHE--SHE KILLED HIM.
SHE DID.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.016
>> CHET...CHET, IT'S OKAY.

27:30.049 --> 27:31.283
IT'S OKAY, CALM DOWN.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.985
TRY TO RELAX.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.254
CHET, SHH, SHH.
STOP IT, STOP IT.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.690
CALM DOWN.
SHH, SHH.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.992
CHET, LOOK AT ME.
JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.094
>> [crying] I HAD ALREADY
MADE THE MARTINIS

27:42.128 --> 27:43.896
WHEN MARV CAME HOME.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.465
AND I ALWAYS GIVE BIRDIE
HER MARTINI FIRST.

27:46.498 --> 27:50.036
SO I--I BROUGHT IT INTO HER.

27:50.069 --> 27:53.039
AND SHE ASKED ME TO GO
TO THE CLOSET TO GET BACK DOWN

27:53.072 --> 27:55.908
HER OLD MOVIES 'CAUSE
SHE LIKES TO WATCH 'EM

27:55.942 --> 27:57.143
WHEN SHE'S SAD.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.779
>> UH-HUH.
AND WHEN YOU CAME BACK...

27:59.812 --> 28:01.848
>> AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW IT.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.951
>> THERE WAS A PILL BOTTLE
BY THE MARTINIS,

28:04.984 --> 28:06.819
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT SHE WAS GONNA DO.

28:06.853 --> 28:10.089
SO I GAVE HER HER MARTINI...

28:10.122 --> 28:12.058
AND THEN I WENT TO HIS ROOM,
AND I GAVE HIM HIS.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.893
AND THAT'S WHEN
HE WENT INTO THE OFFICE.

28:13.926 --> 28:14.894
>> TO SURF PORN.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.328
>> NO, I LIED ABOUT THAT.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.364
HE WAS GETTING MONEY
OUT OF HIS SAFE,

28:18.397 --> 28:20.332
AND HE WAS GETTING
THESE DOCUMENTS

28:20.366 --> 28:22.301
AND STUFFING THEM
INTO A DUFFEL BAG.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.170
SO I TOLD BIRDIE
THAT HE WAS GONNA LEAVE,

28:24.203 --> 28:27.106
AND THEN THEY STARTED ARGUING,
LIKE REALLY BAD ARGUING.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.075
>> AND WHERE WERE YOU?

28:29.108 --> 28:30.977
>> I WAS IN MY ROOM,
AND I COULD--I COULD--

28:31.010 --> 28:34.213
I COULD HEAR 'EM YELLING.

28:34.246 --> 28:36.048
AND THEN MARV JUST STOPPED.

28:36.082 --> 28:39.318
HE STOPPED YELLING.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.154
AND I CAME OUT, AND THE WINDOW
WAS WIDE OPEN.

28:42.188 --> 28:45.758
[sobbing]

28:45.792 --> 28:48.160
BUT I DIDN'T...DO IT.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.896
SHE DID IT.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.068
BIRDIE DID IT.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.938
>> WHAT?

28:58.971 --> 29:01.040
I NEVER TOUCHED MARV'S DRINK.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.242
>> WELL, CHET SAYS YOU DID.

29:03.275 --> 29:07.880
AND YOUR FINGERPRINTS ARE ON
HIS MARTINI GLASS...

29:07.914 --> 29:10.016
AND HIS PILL BOTTLE.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.018
>> HE WOULD NEVER
SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.553
MY CHET WOULD NOT CROSS
HIS AUNT BIRDIE.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.855
>> BRIDGET SULLOWAY,

29:15.888 --> 29:18.057
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.026
NOW, IF YOU GIVE UP THAT RIGHT,
ANYTHING YOU SAY...

29:20.059 --> 29:22.862
>> WHERE'S CHET?
BRING HIM TO ME.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.097
CHET!

29:29.135 --> 29:31.137
>> I DIDN'T WANNA TELL 'EM.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.972
THEY MADE ME DO IT.

29:33.005 --> 29:36.208
>> WE ALL DO WHAT HAVE TO, DEAR.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.485
>> DOCKET ENDING 6126.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.088
PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
VERSUS BRIDGET SULLOWAY.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.990
ONE COUNT
MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.324
>> HOW DOES
THE DEFENDANT PLEAD?

29:52.358 --> 29:54.861
>> NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

29:54.894 --> 29:55.928
>> REQUEST FOR REMAND,
MS. CABOT?

29:55.962 --> 29:57.063
>> $500,000.

29:57.096 --> 30:00.066
>> $50,000--MY CLIENT
IS AN ELDERLY WOMAN WHO POSES--

30:00.099 --> 30:02.468
>> JUST A MINUTE.
I AM NOT ELDERLY.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.702
AND I WILL PAY IT.

30:03.735 --> 30:07.606
>> MA'AM, ANY COMMENTS MUST BE
MADE THROUGH YOUR ATTORNEY.

30:07.639 --> 30:11.410
>> I WILL NOT HAVE HIM ARGUE
OVER MONEY--IT'S VULGAR.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.379
CHET, HAND ME MY CHECKBOOK.

30:25.424 --> 30:28.394
I'LL GET IT.
EVERY PENNY.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.529
>> WE'LL PURSUE AN AFFIRMATIVE
DEFENSE, YOUR HONOR.

30:30.562 --> 30:33.432
EXTREME EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.868
IN ADDITION TO MURDERING
TWO PEOPLE,

30:35.902 --> 30:37.469
MRS. SULLOWAY'S HUSBAND

30:37.503 --> 30:40.372
TORMENTED HER PHYSICALLY
AND MENTALLY.

30:40.406 --> 30:41.540
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE
THAN JUST HER SAY-SO?

30:41.573 --> 30:44.143
MEDICAL REPORTS,
PICTURES OF BRUISES?

30:44.176 --> 30:46.112
>> NO, BUT SHE DID
DESCRIBE THE ABUSE

30:46.145 --> 30:49.515
TO DETECTIVE BENSON JUST PRIOR
TO MR. SULLOWAY'S DEMISE.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.550
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS
TEEING UP HER EXCUSE

30:51.583 --> 30:53.185
BEFORE OFFING THE POOR GUY.

30:53.219 --> 30:56.222
>> THE SAME POOR GUY THE POLICE
SAID STALKED AND MURDERED

30:56.255 --> 30:57.356
TISA FLORES?

30:57.389 --> 30:58.490
MY CLIENT
WAS IN MORTAL TERROR.

30:58.524 --> 31:01.660
>> CONVINCE THE JURY,
MR. STANICH, NOT THIS COURTROOM.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.395
I'LL ALLOW THE DEFENSE.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.966
[pounds gavel]
MS. CABOT, FIRE UP YOUR SHRINK.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.935
>> HELLO, MRS. SULLOWAY.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.102
I'M DR. HUANG.

31:10.136 --> 31:11.437
>> I KNOW.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.305
>> THAT'S RIGHT--
YOU DON'T LIKE DOCTORS.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.074
>> IT'S NOT
THAT I DON'T LIKE THEM.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.642
I JUST FIND YOU USELESS.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.245
YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY COLD
IN HERE.

31:19.278 --> 31:20.279
IT MAKES MY BONES HURT.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.348
DO YOU THINK MAYBE YOU COULD
TURN UP THE HEAT,

31:22.381 --> 31:25.317
OR IS ALL THIS PART
OF YOUR LITTLE INTERROGATION?

31:25.351 --> 31:26.986
>> IT'S NOT
AN INTERROGATION.

31:27.019 --> 31:29.521
IT'S A PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.991
>> OOH. ASSESS.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.326
>> TELL ME ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.196
>> WHAT'S THERE TO SAY?
HE'S DEAD.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.630
>> WELL, YOU DON'T SEEM
VERY UPSET ABOUT THAT.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.532
>> MARV WAS A BASTARD.

31:40.566 --> 31:41.633
I'VE KNOWN A FEW.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.535
>> WERE YOU SCARED OF HIM?

31:43.569 --> 31:45.604
>> WELL, OF COURSE.
HE MURDERED A GIRL.

31:45.637 --> 31:48.407
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT UNTIL AFTERWARDS.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.243
>> NO, WHAT I MEAN IS
IT DIDN'T SURPRISE ME.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.544
MARV WAS A HATEFUL MAN.

31:52.578 --> 31:53.679
HE WAS ALWAYS
PUSHING ME AROUND.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.215
>> BUT YOU NEVER
TRIED TO LEAVE HIM.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.584
>> NO, NO.
CHET WAS WITH ME.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.553
HE WAS ALWAYS VERY PROTECTIVE.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.990
>> WHERE'S CHET NOW?

32:06.325 --> 32:09.962
>> [crying] CHET AND I
ARE ESTRANGED.

32:09.996 --> 32:13.032
>> AND WASN'T IT CHET
WHO TOLD THE POLICE

32:13.065 --> 32:14.600
THAT YOU DRUGGED MR. SULLOWAY?

32:14.633 --> 32:16.702
>> HE WAS SCARED.
>> OF MR. SULLOWAY?

32:16.735 --> 32:20.672
>> [scoffs] WELL, WHO ELSE
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

32:20.706 --> 32:22.508
IS THERE ANOTHER CHAIR
AROUND HERE?

32:22.541 --> 32:26.512
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE?
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

32:26.545 --> 32:27.579
>> OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT

32:27.613 --> 32:28.714
THE NIGHT
THAT YOUR HUSBAND DIED.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.483
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S NOT.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.652
[sighs] LOOK, WE--

32:33.685 --> 32:36.322
WE BOTH KNOW WHERE THIS
IS SUPPOSED TO GO.

32:36.355 --> 32:39.491
YOU COME IN HERE,
PLAYING THE GOOD DOCTOR

32:39.525 --> 32:42.494
WITH YOUR--YOUR TESTS
AND YOUR QUESTIONS

32:42.528 --> 32:44.663
AND YOUR FAKE CONCERN.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.633
AND I PLAY THE TERRIFIED WIFE.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.535
COWERING IN THE CORNER,

32:49.568 --> 32:51.370
SAYING SHE JUST COULDN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.072
>> AND THAT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE?

32:53.105 --> 32:54.540
>> NO.

32:54.573 --> 32:57.009
I WAS TERRIFIED.

32:57.043 --> 33:00.512
MARV WOULD HAVE MURDERED ME
IF I HADN'T DONE WHAT I DID.

33:00.546 --> 33:04.116
BUT BIRDIE SULLOWAY
DOES NOT COWER.

33:04.150 --> 33:07.019
SO...WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR LITTLE ASSESSMENT

33:07.053 --> 33:10.156
BACK TO YOUR BOSSES

33:10.189 --> 33:14.093
AND GET ME THE HELL OUT
OF THIS AWFUL ROOM.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.197
>> NICE WORK.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.632
SHE ALL BUT ADMITTED THE E.E.D.
WAS A SHAM.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.434
>> TECHNICALLY, YES.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.536
BUT I THINK SHE HAS
SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS.

33:24.570 --> 33:25.671
>> MENTAL ONES?

33:25.704 --> 33:27.673
>> ENOUGH TO DERAIL YOUR CASE.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.575
>> SHE SHOWS SIGNS
OF A NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER.

33:29.608 --> 33:32.078
THE BODY STIFFNESS,
THE TWITCHING OF THE EYE,

33:32.111 --> 33:34.580
THE LOSS OF FINE MOTOR CONTROL
IN THE HANDS.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.148
>> SINCE WHEN DO YOU WORK
FOR THE DEFENSE?

33:36.182 --> 33:39.218
>> I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
AS A PHYSICIAN.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.720
THE WOMAN NEEDS TO BE TESTED,
IMMEDIATELY.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.055
>> WELL, GOOD LUCK
CONVINCING HER.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.556
SHE HATES DOCTORS.

33:44.590 --> 33:45.791
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE DO.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.726
UNTIL THEY TRULY NEED ONE.

33:47.759 --> 33:51.630
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A CHOICE
BETWEEN A NON-INVASIVE PET SCAN

33:51.663 --> 33:54.066
AND BEING CONVICTED AT TRIAL.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.735
[faint whirring]

33:56.768 --> 34:00.139
>> AS I SUSPECTED:
PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROME.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.840
THE CANCER PROBABLY STARTED
IN HER RIGHT LUNG

34:01.873 --> 34:03.809
AND THEN MOVED
TO HER OTHER ORGANS.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.678
>> CANCER?
HOW IS THAT NEUROLOGICAL?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.714
>> CERTAIN TUMORS
SECRETE HORMONES

34:08.747 --> 34:10.616
THAT CAN CAUSE
UNBALANCED BEHAVIOR.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.251
>> PROGNOSIS?

34:12.284 --> 34:13.852
>> EVEN WITH AGGRESSIVE
CHEMOTHERAPY,

34:13.885 --> 34:16.188
FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS
AT THE MOST.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.490
>> WHICH DWIGHT STANICH
WILL FILL WITH MOTIONS

34:18.524 --> 34:21.593
AND CONTINUANCES,
AND BIRDIE WILL NEVER SEE TRIAL.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.662
CASE DIES WITH HER.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.497
>> GOD GAVE HER
THE DEATH PENALTY,

34:25.531 --> 34:27.633
EVEN IF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COULDN'T.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.372
>> HOW MANY?

34:33.405 --> 34:35.407
>> OVER A DOZEN
MALIGNANT TUMORS.

34:35.441 --> 34:38.110
>> [scoffs]

34:38.144 --> 34:40.112
WELL, I GUESS
IT'S TOO LATE, THEN.

34:40.146 --> 34:44.316
>> AT THIS POINT,
THE TREATMENT OPTIONS...

34:44.350 --> 34:45.517
ARE LIMITED.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.752
>> [chuckles weakly]

34:46.785 --> 34:49.155
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW WHY
I NEVER LIKED DOCTORS.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.357
HEH.

34:51.390 --> 34:53.359
>> I'M SORRY.

34:53.392 --> 34:54.793
>> OH, WELL.

34:54.826 --> 34:58.764
NO ONE EVER SAID LIFE WAS FAIR.
ONLY EVENTFUL.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.533
>> MRS. SULLOWAY...

35:01.567 --> 35:03.769
IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING...

35:07.706 --> 35:09.741
>> CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

35:09.775 --> 35:11.143
>> OF COURSE.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.578
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS

35:12.611 --> 35:15.381
WHEN THIS OLD CIRCUS
FOLDS ITS TENTS AND--

35:15.414 --> 35:16.848
AND MOVES ON?

35:16.882 --> 35:19.418
IS THERE ANOTHER TOWN
ON THE OTHER SIDE,

35:19.451 --> 35:22.821
OR IS IT ALL
JUST A LOT OF NOTHIN'?

35:22.854 --> 35:27.193
>> THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS
AREN'T EXACTLY MY SPECIALTY.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.694
>> [sniffles]

35:28.727 --> 35:30.729
YEAH, I'VE JUST BEEN WONDERING,

35:30.762 --> 35:35.267
EVER SINCE MY THIRD HUSBAND
PASSED AWAY--PHILIP.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.869
HE DIED IN MY ARMS AND, UH,

35:37.903 --> 35:42.508
YOU KNOW, I--I SAW THE LIGHT
GO OUT IN HIS EYES.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.910
IT MADE ME CURIOUS

35:44.943 --> 35:49.181
AS TO...WHAT IT WAS
HE WAS SEEING.

35:49.215 --> 35:53.619
YOU KNOW?

35:53.652 --> 35:56.888
>> YOU'RE NOT BUYING THIS,
ARE YOU?

35:56.922 --> 36:01.493
>> BIRDIE TOLD ME THAT PHILIP
WAS SWEPT OFF THEIR YACHT.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.829
SO HOW COULD SHE HAVE SEEN
THE LIGHT GO OUT IN HIS EYES?

36:03.862 --> 36:06.198
>> HUANG SAYS THE CANCER'S
MADE HER CUCKOO.

36:06.232 --> 36:07.466
MAYBE SHE WAS CONFUSED.

36:07.499 --> 36:11.470
>> OR MAYBE...MARV WASN'T
HER FIRST VICTIM.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.772
>> PHILIP GOLDBERG,
LOST AT SEA.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.575
ONLY WITNESS TO THE INCIDENT:
HIS NEW BRIDE, BIRDIE.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.844
>> "ACCIDENTAL" OVERDOSE.

36:18.877 --> 36:21.247
"SLIPPED" AND FELL DOWN
THE STAIRS.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.350
BRAKE FAILURE, AND OF COURSE
MARV WAS A SUICIDE.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.951
>> NOW, YOU ADD THESE UP,
YOU GOT A KILLING SPREE

36:25.984 --> 36:27.886
THAT SPREADS OUT OVER 40 YEARS.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.588
>> THAT'S WHY NO ONE EVER
PUT IT TOGETHER.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.590
>> BIRDIE SAID
THAT SHE ONLY HAD A TALENT

36:31.623 --> 36:32.858
FOR ATTRACTING BAD MEN.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.426
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
SHE HAD ANOTHER ONE.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.527
GETTING RID OF 'EM.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.796
>> SO WE'RE THINKING
BLACK WIDOW.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.666
>> NO, INSURANCE COMPANIES
MADE PAYOUTS ON THE FIRST FOUR,

36:40.699 --> 36:41.900
BUT THEY WERE MODEST.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.134
>> WELL, I THINK
THE REAL STORY HERE

36:43.168 --> 36:44.770
IS THAT EACH ONE OF HER HUSBANDS
HAD SOME KIND OF RAP SHEET,

36:44.803 --> 36:47.973
FROM COCAINE TRAFFICKING,
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY,

36:48.006 --> 36:50.842
UH, EMBEZZLING,
RAPE, AND MURDER.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.245
>> FROM LITTLE ORPHAN BALLERINA
TO DIRTY HARRIET

36:53.279 --> 36:55.414
IN FIVE EASY STEPS.

36:55.447 --> 36:58.850
>> YES, I KILLED ALL OF 'EM.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.952
>> BIRDIE, NOT ANOTHER WORD.

37:00.986 --> 37:04.990
DETECTIVES, WE ALL KNOW
MY CLIENT IS IN FAILING HEALTH.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.259
AND THIS INCLUDES
HER MENTAL FACULTIES.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.795
>> DWIGHT, PLEASE, I ALREADY
HAVE A DEATH SENTENCE.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.863
AND BESIDES, I'M HAPPY
WITH WHAT I'VE ACHIEVED.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.565
>> MURDER IS AN ACHIEVEMENT?

37:13.599 --> 37:15.901
>> I RID THE WORLD
OF FIVE HORRIBLE MEN.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.936
WOULD YOU RATHER
THEY STILL BE ALIVE?

37:17.969 --> 37:18.870
>> WELL, WHAT ABOUT
DUE PROCESS?

37:18.904 --> 37:20.706
>> I PREFER JUSTICE.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.274
>> WELL, IN YOUR CASE,
IT'S BEEN SERVED.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.942
>> HAS IT?

37:23.975 --> 37:25.944
OR IS THERE ANOTHER MURDERER
OUT THERE,

37:25.977 --> 37:27.313
FREE AS A BIRD?

37:27.346 --> 37:30.716
>> YOU'RE LYING.

37:30.749 --> 37:34.820
>> WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK AND
CHECK THOSE INSURANCE REPORTS?

37:34.853 --> 37:39.425
I WAS TWO STATES AWAY
WHEN RAY FELL DOWN THOSE STAIRS.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.660
AND DO YOU REALLY THINK
A LITTLE OLD LADY

37:41.693 --> 37:46.665
WOULD KNOW WHICH CABLE TO CUT
UNDER WALTER'S CAR?

37:46.698 --> 37:48.767
OR COULD IT HAVE BEEN
A YOUNG MAN

37:48.800 --> 37:50.469
WHO WOULD DO
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

37:50.502 --> 37:53.372
HIS AUNT ASKED HIM TO?

38:04.049 --> 38:08.487
>> AUNT BIRDIE?

38:08.520 --> 38:10.589
>> [weakly] CHET.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.558
YOU CAME.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.826
>> OF COURSE I CAME.

38:14.860 --> 38:19.931
THE MINUTE
YOU LEFT THE MESSAGE.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.967
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.569
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY?

38:23.602 --> 38:26.037
>> NOT THIS TIME,
SWEETHEART, NO.

38:26.071 --> 38:29.608
BUT...I'M BETTER NOW.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.813
>> OHH.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.915
>> OH, I'M SO SORRY
I TOLD THE POLICE.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.884
AND THEN I RAN AWAY.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.786
>> SHH, SHH.
YOU'RE HERE NOW.

38:40.819 --> 38:45.591
AND YOU'RE SAFE.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.493
>> WHAT ABOUT THE COURT CASE?

38:47.526 --> 38:50.796
>> IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

38:50.829 --> 38:55.133
IT'S TOO LATE FOR EVERYTHING,
EXCEPT US.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.669
>> I WAS SO SCARED
YOU WERE GONNA BE MAD AT ME.

38:57.703 --> 39:00.105
>> WHAT, YOU?
OH, IMPOSSIBLE.

39:00.138 --> 39:01.907
[chuckles] NO, NO.

39:01.940 --> 39:06.011
I'M JUST HAPPY YOU'RE NOT MAD
AT YOUR OLD BIRDIE.

39:10.716 --> 39:11.950
>> WHY?

39:11.983 --> 39:16.054
>> FOR WHAT I MADE YOU DO.

39:16.087 --> 39:19.425
HELPING ME WITH MARV.
AND ALL THE OTHERS.

39:19.458 --> 39:22.461
>> YOU DIDN'T MAKE ME
DO THOSE THINGS.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.129
I WANTED TO HELP.
I WOULD DO IT AGAIN.

39:24.162 --> 39:27.966
>> DON'T SAY THAT.
>> BUT I WOULD.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.736
I'D PUSH TEN MORE OF THOSE
BASTARDS OUT THE WINDOW

39:30.769 --> 39:32.938
IF YOU ASKED ME TO.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.906
>> THAT'S MY CHET.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.643
THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER
REALLY LOVED ME.

39:37.676 --> 39:43.849
I ONLY WISH WE HAD THE CHANCE
TO BE TOGETHER.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.951
ONE LAST TIME.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.722
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

39:50.756 --> 39:52.157
THERE'S STILL TIME.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.759
>> NO, NO.
NO, NO, DARLING.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.861
THERE'S NOT.

39:55.894 --> 39:59.097
YOU SEE, YOU'RE GOING
ON A LITTLE TRIP.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.999
[door opens]

40:07.606 --> 40:09.040
>> WHY? WHY?

40:09.074 --> 40:13.011
>> 30 YEARS
AT YOUR AUNT BIRDIE'S SIDE...

40:13.044 --> 40:16.848
AND YOU NEVER LEARNED
NOT TO CROSS HER.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.553
>> YOU--NO, NO.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.021
NO.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.430
>> WE ALL DO WHAT WE HAVE TO.

40:43.542 --> 40:46.545
