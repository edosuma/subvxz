WEBVTT

00:09.600 --> 00:12.767
- OKAY, SO DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHAT GUSTAVO'S BIG NEWS IS?

00:12.767 --> 00:14.433
- WELL, LET'S JUST HOPE
IT'S ABOUT GETTING

00:14.433 --> 00:17.267
SOME AWESOME PANTRY SNACKS
AND NOT ANOTHER TV CAMEO.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.667
- IN THE LAST WEEK ALONE,
WE'VE DONE

00:18.667 --> 00:21.700
NCSI: SPECIAL ANIMAL UNIT,
DEADLIEST CUPCAKE...

00:21.700 --> 00:23.767
- AND THAT SUPER-SLOPPY
GAME SHOW.

00:25.867 --> 00:28.033
UGH, OH.

00:28.033 --> 00:29.900
UGH.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.533
I CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER CAMEO.

00:31.533 --> 00:35.733
- DOGS,
I HAVE SOME BIG NEWS.

00:35.733 --> 00:38.233
- PLEASE TELL US IT'S NOT
ANOTHER CAMEO.

00:38.233 --> 00:40.000
- I HATE ALL OF YOU!

00:40.000 --> 00:41.833
- GUYS, IF WE ARE GONNA STAY
IN THE SPOTLIGHT,

00:41.833 --> 00:46.100
WE NEED TO STAY ON RADIO,
MAGAZINE COVERS, AND TV.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.833
- GUSTAVO, WE LOVE YOU.

00:47.833 --> 00:51.600
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE
THE STUDIO TO DO ANOTHER CAMEO.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.367
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.

00:54.367 --> 00:55.933
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY IN ONE.

00:55.933 --> 00:56.933
[together]
WHAT?

00:56.933 --> 00:59.467
[kids yelling]

00:59.467 --> 01:03.133
[together]
OW! OW! STOP!

01:03.133 --> 01:05.533
- [laughs]

01:05.533 --> 01:08.200
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A BIG-TIME SHOCK.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.533
AND THAT WRAPS UP
ANOTHER EDITION

01:09.533 --> 01:11.367
OF SCOTT BAIO'S TASER TOTS.

01:11.367 --> 01:12.500
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.067

02:02.367 --> 02:06.200
- GUSTAVO,
NO MORE CAMEOS.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.700
OH, REALLY?

02:08.700 --> 02:12.433
WELL, THEN...
NO MORE CAMEOS!

02:12.433 --> 02:13.700
- WHAT TV SHOW THIS TIME?

02:13.700 --> 02:15.167
- COCO.O.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.600
[gasps]

02:16.600 --> 02:19.500
YOU MEAN THE KIDZIE CHANNEL
TV SHOW ABOUT THE GIRL ROBOT,

02:19.500 --> 02:22.100
BUT ONLY HER SPUNKY BEST FRIEND
KNOWS THAT SHE'S A ROBOT,

02:22.100 --> 02:23.667
AND IF THE POPULAR KIDS
FOUND OUT,

02:23.667 --> 02:24.833
SHE'D BE SCRAPPED FOR PARTS?

02:24.833 --> 02:26.067
- THAT'S THE ONE.

02:26.067 --> 02:27.400
- OH.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.467
- A LOT OF OUR FANS WORSHIP
THAT SHOW.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.500
- OH,
AND THE ROBOT WHO PLAYS COCO...

02:31.500 --> 02:34.067
OH-HO,
SHE'S AMAZING.

02:34.067 --> 02:35.367
- YOU MEAN THE ACTRESS.

02:35.367 --> 02:37.500
- ACTRESS.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.200
- UM, BUT WE ALL AGREED
NO MORE CAMEOS.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.167
- OKAY, BUT BEFORE YOU SAY NO,

02:43.167 --> 02:45.933
JUST WATCH A LITTLE BIT
OF THE SHOW.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.933
[laughter]

02:47.933 --> 02:50.400
- OKAY, LINDSAY,
NOW I'M READY TO INTERFACE

02:50.400 --> 02:52.267
WITH THE POPULAR GIRLS
AT STUDY HALL.

02:52.267 --> 02:53.733
- UM, NO.

02:53.733 --> 02:57.967
COCO,
THOSE SHOES ARE SO LAST YEAR.

02:57.967 --> 03:00.800
- UH-OH,
BETTER REBOOT.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.200
[laughter]

03:02.200 --> 03:04.600
- [laughs]

03:04.600 --> 03:05.767
I LOVE HER.

03:05.767 --> 03:08.367
- I AM NOT DOING
ANOTHER DANGEROUS CAMEO

03:08.367 --> 03:10.300
BECAUSE CARLOS IS IN ROBOT LOVE.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.867
SO SOMEBODY ELSE GIVE ME
ANOTHER REASON

03:11.867 --> 03:13.100
WHY WE SHOULD DO IT.

03:13.100 --> 03:16.367
- WELL, THERE ARE...

03:16.367 --> 03:19.200
AWESOME SNACKS ON TV SETS.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.900
- AND LOOK AT HIM.

03:23.833 --> 03:25.300
- DARN IT.

03:28.433 --> 03:30.933
- OKAY, HERE'S THE SET
WHERE COCO GETS YOU TO PERFORM

03:30.933 --> 03:32.200
AT THE SCHOOL DANCE.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.300
OH,
THEY'RE FINISHING A SCENE NOW.

03:35.300 --> 03:39.600
- COCO, IF BIG TIME RUSH DOESN'T
SHOW UP LIKE YOU PROMISED,

03:39.600 --> 03:41.933
EVERYONE IS GONNA KNOW
YOU'RE A ROBOT.

03:41.933 --> 03:43.867
- MY PROCESSOR
IS OVERSTRESSED...

03:43.867 --> 03:45.767
AND OVERDRESSED.

03:45.767 --> 03:46.867
[bell ringing]

03:46.867 --> 03:48.300
- OKAY, THAT'S A CUT.

03:49.633 --> 03:52.100
AND HERE COMES
AMERICA'S SWEETHEART,

03:52.100 --> 03:53.733
DARA LARAMIE.

03:53.733 --> 03:54.867
- HI, GUYS.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.433
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GONNA DO
MY SHOW.

03:56.433 --> 03:57.900
- WELL,
THEY ARE VERY GLAD TO--

03:57.900 --> 03:59.067
[together]
HERE'S CARLOS.

03:59.067 --> 04:02.400
- UH, UH, I--I--I...

04:02.400 --> 04:04.700
- BACK IT UP, BOY BAND.

04:04.700 --> 04:07.600
DARA IS NOT LOOKING
FOR A BOYFRIEND.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.867
DARA, LEARN YOUR LINES
FOR THE NEXT SCENE NOW.

04:09.867 --> 04:11.400
- YES, MA'AM.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.967
- WHOO,
WHO'S THE EVIL STEPMOTHER?

04:16.967 --> 04:18.333
- HER EVIL STEPMOTHER.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.933
- OH. OH...

04:19.933 --> 04:24.300
- SHE RUNS DARA'S CAREER
AND THE SHOW WITH AN IRON FIST.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.800
DO NOT CROSS HER.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.267
- OH.

04:29.267 --> 04:31.300
- HUH,
THOUGHT SHE'D BE SPUNKIER.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.867
- OKAY, FOCUS.

04:32.867 --> 04:34.633
HOW DO I KISS DARA?

04:34.633 --> 04:37.100
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS,
PRINCE NOT-SO-CHARMING?

04:37.100 --> 04:39.100
- WELL, YEAH,
YOU FIND YOUR GLASS SLIPPER.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.300
DON'T EAT THE APPLE,
THOUGH.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.233
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE HER HOME
BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

04:42.233 --> 04:45.600
AND BIPPITY-BOPPITY-BOO,
EVIL STEPMOTHER SPELL BROKEN.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.067
- GOOD PLAN.
LET'S GO.

04:47.067 --> 04:48.133
- WHAT?
I WAS KIDDING.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.600
- HEY! NO!

04:49.600 --> 04:52.067
YOU TWO NEED TO GO TO WARDROBE.

04:52.067 --> 04:53.067
- HIT THE SNACK TABLE.

04:53.067 --> 04:54.967
- GOT IT.

04:54.967 --> 04:56.600
- THEY ARE TERRIBLE.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.533
- NO, WHAT'S TERRIBLE
IS THIS SCRIPT.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.433
IT MAKES THE GUYS
LOOK LIKE IDIOTS.

05:01.433 --> 05:02.600
both: THEY ARE IDIOTS.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.267
- SO ARE TV WRITERS.

05:05.267 --> 05:09.433
[laughter]

05:09.433 --> 05:11.367
- YEAH.

05:11.367 --> 05:12.500
CAN I HELP YOU?

05:12.500 --> 05:13.567
- YES, HELLO.

05:13.567 --> 05:16.133
I AM THE PRODUCER
OF BIG TIME RUSH,

05:16.133 --> 05:19.067
AND THIS SCRIPT MAKES JAMES
LOOK SELF-CENTERED,

05:19.067 --> 05:23.167
CARLOS LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT,
LOGAN LOOK LIKE A SCIENCE NERD,

05:23.167 --> 05:26.867
AND KENDALL LOOK LIKE SOME GUY
WHO'S ALWAYS GIVING PEP TALKS.

05:26.867 --> 05:28.567
- YEAH,
WHO WOULD WATCH THAT?

05:28.567 --> 05:30.833
- UH--
- AND WHERE'S THE ROMANCE?

05:30.833 --> 05:34.267
I'M A TWEENAGE GIRL, AND I WANT
SOME TWEENAGE ROMANCE.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.133
- HEY, WE GAVE COCO A KISS CHIP,

05:37.133 --> 05:39.267
BUT DARA'S STEPMOM
WON'T LET US USE IT,

05:39.267 --> 05:42.133
AND SHE'LL FIRE US
IF WE CHANGE THE SCRIPT

05:42.133 --> 05:44.733
AFTER SHE'S APPROVED IT,
WHICH SHE DID.

05:44.733 --> 05:46.500
COME ON, GANG.
LET'S GET A THREE-HOUR LUNCH.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.933
- PIZZA.
- I'M CRAVING BURRITOS.

05:47.933 --> 05:51.967
- I'M THINKING BUFFALO
SOMETHING.

05:53.267 --> 05:54.533
- SO WE REWRITE THE SCRIPT?

05:56.767 --> 05:59.400
both: WE'RE NOT AFRAID
OF SOME EVIL STEPMOTHER.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.467
[dramatic music]

06:02.467 --> 06:04.500
*

06:04.500 --> 06:06.533
- [coughs]

06:06.533 --> 06:10.633
GET THAT THING OFF MY SET.

06:10.633 --> 06:11.900
AHEM.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.767
FIRE HIM.

06:20.067 --> 06:22.833
- OKAY, NOW YOU JUST NEED
TO FIND DARA,

06:22.833 --> 06:24.233
TELL HER THAT YOU LOVE THE SHOW,

06:24.233 --> 06:26.267
THAT YOU'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT IT
OVER A SMOOTHIE.

06:26.267 --> 06:27.833
- I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT.

06:27.833 --> 06:29.200
- CARLOS.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.133
- HI.

06:33.133 --> 06:34.267
- HELLO.

06:34.267 --> 06:36.367
- [laughs]

06:36.367 --> 06:39.167
- I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I WAS REALLY EXCITED

06:39.167 --> 06:40.733
WHEN I HEARD YOU WERE COMING
ON THE SHOW.

06:42.867 --> 06:45.367
- OKAY, GOOD START.
GOOD START.

06:45.367 --> 06:47.967
NOW MAKE A DATE WITH BEAUTY
BEFORE THE BEAST COMES IN.

06:47.967 --> 06:50.167
NO.

06:50.167 --> 06:53.933
- DARA, PERHAPS I DIDN'T MAKE
MYSELF CLEAR.

06:53.933 --> 06:57.600
I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR
BIG TIME RUSH AGAIN.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.667
TO YOUR MAKEUP TRAILER NOW.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.400
- YES, MA'AM.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.433
- LISTEN HERE, LOVERBOY.

07:05.433 --> 07:08.100
YEAH, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM DARA.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.067
- OH, ACTUALLY,
HE'S THE LOVERBOY.

07:10.067 --> 07:12.067
- I'M NOT JUST DARA'S STEPMOM.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.500
I'M ALSO HER MANAGER.

07:13.500 --> 07:18.433
AND ACCORDING TO HER LAST POST
TO HER 14 MILLION FANS,

07:18.433 --> 07:22.733
HER TOTAL BESTIE.

07:22.733 --> 07:25.567
AND IF I DECIDE
TO LET HER HAVE A BOYFRIEND

07:25.567 --> 07:28.800
OR USE HER KISS CHIP,
IT WILL BE ON A BOY NAMED BIEBER

07:28.800 --> 07:31.867
OR LAUTNER,
NOT YOU.

07:31.867 --> 07:34.067
- SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DATE
WHOEVER SHE WANTS.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.100
- WRONG!

07:35.100 --> 07:38.067
AND IF I SEE YOU
FLIRTING HER AGAIN,

07:38.067 --> 07:39.700
I WILL HAVE YOU REMOVED
FROM THE LOT

07:39.700 --> 07:42.833
FOR HARASSING AMERICA'S
TV SWEETHEART.

07:42.833 --> 07:44.500
- Y-YOU MEAN ME,
NOT HIM.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.667
- GO.

07:45.667 --> 07:49.267
both: OKAY. GO. GO. GO.

07:53.100 --> 07:57.233
- COCO.O HAS THE WORST SPREAD
IN TELEVISION HISTORY.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.467
- OKAY,
THIS IS AN ACTUAL TWIG.

08:01.467 --> 08:04.900
- THIS IS THE ONLY FOOD
THAT DARA'S STEPMOTHER

08:04.900 --> 08:10.733
WILL LET HER EAT,
SO WE HAVE TO EAT IT TOO.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.933
- AGAIN, I REALLY THOUGHT
SHE'D BE SPUNKIER.

08:14.933 --> 08:16.933
- MY BODY IS A TEMPLE,

08:16.933 --> 08:19.233
AND THIS TEMPLE
NEEDS BETTER SNACKS.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.067
- OKAY,
WE ARE ON A HOLLYWOOD LOT.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.767
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME SHOW
THAT DOESN'T SERVE PRISON FOOD.

08:25.933 --> 08:27.400
[both sniffing]

08:27.400 --> 08:31.067
- THAT WAY.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.133
both: SNACKPOT!

08:40.133 --> 08:41.300
- ALL RIGHT.

08:41.300 --> 08:42.767
OH, SWEET.

08:42.767 --> 08:44.767
- OOH, AND HEALTHY.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.133
- THIS SPREAD IS AMAZING.

08:46.133 --> 08:47.267
- WHAT SHOW IS THIS?

08:47.267 --> 08:50.800
- YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT NICE...

08:50.800 --> 08:53.067
TO TAKE THINGS
THAT DON'T BELONG TO YOU.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.600
- THAT'S RIGHT, PLEX.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.633
YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE THINGS
THAT DON'T BELONG TO YOU.

08:58.633 --> 09:00.500
- IT'S YO GABBA GABBA.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.100
[together]
*IF THE SNACKS AREN'T YOURS *

09:02.100 --> 09:03.933
*YOU JUST CAN'T GRAB 'EM. *

09:03.933 --> 09:07.467
*YOU JUST CAN'T GRAB 'EM,
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT RIGHT. *

09:07.467 --> 09:10.533
*THE SNACKS AREN'T YOURS,
SO YOU CAN'T HAVE 'EM *

09:10.533 --> 09:13.467
*YOU CAN'T HAVE 'EM,
SO PLEASE GO SIT OUTSIDE *

09:13.467 --> 09:15.067
[laughter]

09:15.067 --> 09:18.300
- I WANT THOSE SNACKS.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.700
- FIVE MINUTES.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.467
WE SHOOT THE "MEAN GIRLS LAND
IN THE GELATIN BOWL SCENE"

09:22.467 --> 09:24.300
IN FIVE.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.100
- A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.

09:28.233 --> 09:29.967
YOUR OTHER LEFT.

09:29.967 --> 09:31.833
AND CRUELLA SAID TO STAY AWAY
FROM DARA.

09:31.833 --> 09:35.833
- NO, SHE SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO SEE US NEAR DARA.

09:35.833 --> 09:38.100
AND BESIDES,
MY KISS WILL SET HER FREE

09:38.100 --> 09:40.200
FROM HER EVIL STEPMOTHER.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.167
DARA, IT'S ME.

09:42.167 --> 09:43.867
- CARLOS?

09:43.867 --> 09:45.467
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

09:45.467 --> 09:46.567
- I KNOW.

09:46.567 --> 09:47.667
- IF MY STEPMOTHER SEES YOU,

09:47.667 --> 09:49.300
I'M AFRAID OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO YOU.

09:49.300 --> 09:51.700
- I'LL RISK ANYTHING FOR YOU,
AND DON'T WORRY,

09:51.700 --> 09:53.300
MY FRIEND IS WATCHING OUT
FOR US.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.700

OKAY, GUYS, LET'S WRAP IT UP.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.100
YOU HEARD HER.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.233

10:11.233 --> 10:15.567

MAKING ME BIG-TIME CRY.

10:15.567 --> 10:19.167
"CALLED ME NAMES

10:19.167 --> 10:21.567

10:21.567 --> 10:22.733
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

10:22.733 --> 10:26.433
- YES, I CAN, AND WHEN
HER 14 MILLION FOLLOWERS

10:26.433 --> 10:29.433

10:34.833 --> 10:37.233
[cackling]

10:39.933 --> 10:41.267
TURN THAT RED LIGHT OFF.

10:41.267 --> 10:42.400
IT'S MELTING MY SKIN.

10:42.400 --> 10:47.267

10:54.900 --> 10:56.800
I PROMISE NEVER TO TALK
TO CARLOS AGAIN

10:56.800 --> 10:59.067
JUST DON'T RUIN BIG TIME RUSH.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.500
- NO, SHE CAN PRESS IT.
I DON'T CARE.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.267
- SHUT UP.

11:05.267 --> 11:07.667
- YOU'RE LUCKY I'M IN
A GOOD MOOD.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.367
DARA...

11:10.367 --> 11:14.500
DO NOT GIVE ME ANOTHER REASON
TO DESTROY YOU.

11:15.933 --> 11:16.867
- GOOD-BYE, CARLOS.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.667
- OKAY,

I'M GONNA KICK YOUR--

11:23.333 --> 11:25.233
[bell ringing]

11:25.233 --> 11:27.067

11:27.067 --> 11:29.433
IS YO GABBA SHOOTING.

11:31.467 --> 11:33.433

[bell rings]

11:40.967 --> 11:41.967
HEY, GUYS.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.100
- WHAT'S UP?

11:43.100 --> 11:44.933
- YOU GUYS WEREN'T LISTENING
TO US.

11:44.933 --> 11:46.333
THAT'S WHAT'S UP.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.067
- YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LISTEN
SO YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO DO.

11:49.067 --> 11:50.733
- LIKE LISTENING TO THIS SONG.

11:50.733 --> 11:52.633
- WE DON'T WANT TO LISTEN
TO A SONG.

11:52.633 --> 11:54.067
- WE JUST WANT A SNACK,
OKAY?

11:54.067 --> 11:55.633
[together]
*LISTENING IS GOOD *

11:55.633 --> 11:57.267
*LISTENING IS GOOD *

11:57.267 --> 11:58.433
*SECURITY *

11:58.433 --> 11:59.533
- WAIT...

11:59.533 --> 12:01.867
- THAT LAST PART
DIDN'T EVEN RHYME.

12:02.967 --> 12:04.067
both: OH.

12:08.467 --> 12:10.367
- OKAY,
WHERE'S THE BIG REWRITE

12:10.367 --> 12:11.933
THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE GUYS
LOOK STUPID?

12:11.933 --> 12:13.100
- OKAY, CHECK IT.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.133
ALL THE KIDS AT THE DANCE
START LEAVING,

12:15.133 --> 12:17.767
'CAUSE BIG TIME RUSH
DIDN'T SHOW UP,

12:17.767 --> 12:20.600
BUT THEN THEY DO SHOW UP,
AND THEN KENDALL'S LIKE,

12:20.600 --> 12:23.633
"YO, COCO, BIG TIME RUSH

12:23.633 --> 12:25.233
AT THE JIMMY-JAM."

12:25.233 --> 12:27.933
AND THEN EVERYBODY STARTS
DANCING AND CHEERING.

12:27.933 --> 12:29.567
AND THEN COCO IS LIKE,
"GUESS WHAT.

12:29.567 --> 12:30.733
I'M GONNA BUY YOUR NEW ALBUM."

12:30.733 --> 12:32.200
AND THEN EVERYONE IS LIKE,

12:32.200 --> 12:35.133
"WOW, WE ARE GONNA BUY
YOUR NEW ALBUM ALSO.

12:35.133 --> 12:36.567
YEAH."

12:36.567 --> 12:38.700
- AGAIN,
WHERE IS THE NEW REWRITE

12:38.700 --> 12:40.700
THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE GUYS
LOOKS STUPID?

12:40.700 --> 12:42.067
- OKAY, FINE, WELL, YOU KNOW,

WHERE IS KATIE'S BIG
TWEENAGE ROMANCE SCENE, HUH?

12:44.367 --> 12:45.700
WHERE IS IT?

12:45.700 --> 12:47.767

A LITTLE POLISHING.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.833
- YEAH--
- NO. OKAY...

12:48.833 --> 12:50.167
I JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT
MORE TIME.

- GIVE ME THAT.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.400
HA!
YOU GOT NOTHING!

12:54.400 --> 12:55.767
- YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOOD
WITH SWEET!

12:55.767 --> 12:58.067
- STOP FIGHTING, AND COME UP
WITH A BETTER ENDING FAST

12:58.067 --> 12:59.600
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO
THE SCHEDULE,

12:59.600 --> 13:01.567
THE GUYS ARE IN WARDROBE
RIGHT NOW.

13:04.433 --> 13:06.467
- 'SUP?
BIG TIME RUSH.

13:06.467 --> 13:09.600
- WE'RE DOING A CAMEO
ON YO GABBA GABBA.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.133
*WE WANT SNACKS,
TASTY SNACKS ARE GOOD *

13:12.133 --> 13:14.700

13:22.300 --> 13:23.900
- REALLY?

13:23.900 --> 13:26.367
- WELL, WE ARE ABOUT TO SING
AND DANCE A SONG.

13:26.367 --> 13:28.400
- BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD SING
A NEW SONG CALLED

13:28.400 --> 13:31.167
WELL, WELL, WELL,
SOMEONE'S BEING NAUGHTY AGAIN.

13:31.167 --> 13:34.300

SHARING FOOD

13:34.300 --> 13:35.600
WITH YOUR NEW FRIENDS SONG,
HUH?

13:35.600 --> 13:36.633
WHERE'S THAT ONE?

13:36.633 --> 13:38.600
DID HE SAY "SHARE?"

13:38.600 --> 13:40.100
- HMM.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.233
- WE JUST ARE REALLY HUNGRY,

13:41.233 --> 13:43.067
AND THE SNACKS
ON OUR STAGE STINK.

13:43.067 --> 13:46.300
- WELL,
NOT SHARING STINKS TOO.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.100
- CAN YOU SHARE SOMETHING
WITH US?

13:48.100 --> 13:49.433
- WE CAN SHARE.
- WE LOVE TO SHARE.

13:49.433 --> 13:50.633
- NAME IT.

13:50.633 --> 13:53.500
- HOW ABOUT THEY SHARE
THEIR VOICES AND SING?

13:53.500 --> 13:56.200
[laughter]

13:56.200 --> 13:59.900
all: * I LOVE TO SHARE
WITH MY FRIENDS *

13:59.900 --> 14:03.400
*IT'S NEVER ANY FUN
BY MYSELF *

14:03.400 --> 14:07.133
* I LOVE TO SHARE

14:07.133 --> 14:11.233
*AND THEY SHARE WITH ME,

14:11.233 --> 14:13.833
*TOGETHER,
SHARING FOREVER *

14:13.833 --> 14:16.400
*IT'S FUN *

14:16.400 --> 14:19.500
- COCO,
BIG TIME RUSH IS NOT COMING.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.767
SO YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THEM.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.567
- AND ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A ROBOT.

14:23.567 --> 14:26.100
- UH...

14:26.100 --> 14:27.133
UH...

14:27.133 --> 14:28.867

14:28.867 --> 14:31.333
OKAY, LET'S RESET CAMERAS
AND GET READY

14:31.333 --> 14:33.233
FOR OUR BIG TIME CAMEO.

14:34.867 --> 14:37.233
- OH, TELL ME THAT ISN'T
A LOVE NOTE.

14:37.233 --> 14:38.533
- IT'S NOT.

14:38.533 --> 14:40.433
IT'S A LOVE PLANE.

14:40.433 --> 14:41.633
- IT'S TOO RISKY.

14:41.633 --> 14:43.433
AND BESIDES,
YOU STINK AT PAPER AIRPLANES.

14:43.433 --> 14:45.467
- BUT LOVE IS MY CO-PILOT.

14:53.933 --> 14:56.767
- UGH, I HATE CAMEOS.

14:59.333 --> 15:03.933
- "MY DEAREST DARA,
IT'S ME CARLOS.

15:03.933 --> 15:08.800
"LET ME HELP SAVE YOU FROM YOUR
EVIL STEPMOM.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.867
":I THINK OUR KISS WILL HELP BE
FREE YOU FROM HER EVILNESS.

15:12.867 --> 15:14.533
"MAN, SHE'S EVIL.

15:14.533 --> 15:16.967
WELL, BYE."

15:16.967 --> 15:18.333
I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY.

15:18.333 --> 15:19.600
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:19.600 --> 15:21.100
YOU CAN'T KEEP THEM APART.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.433
BECAUSE WE'RE IN
THE NEXT SCENE WITH HER,

15:23.433 --> 15:25.100
AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE
TO SING.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.133
NOW,
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

15:27.133 --> 15:29.567
- [clears throat]

15:29.567 --> 15:33.100
LINDSAY, TELL THE WRITERS
TO CHANGE THE NEXT SCENE

15:33.100 --> 15:37.067
SO THAT BIG TIME RUSH
NEVER SHOWS UP TO THE DANCE,

15:37.067 --> 15:41.400
BUT COCO USES HER MUSIC CHIP
TO SING A ROCKIN' SONG

15:41.400 --> 15:46.767
LAUNCHING DARA'S MUSIC CAREER
BUT ENDING BIG TIME RUSH'S.

15:48.367 --> 15:50.933
[thunder booming]

15:52.900 --> 15:55.067
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

15:56.833 --> 16:00.733
- HEY, GUYS, EVIL STEPMONSTER
SAYS TO TAKE BIG TIME RUSH

16:00.733 --> 16:03.467

16:09.300 --> 16:11.333
- TAKE BIG TIME RUSH OUT
OF THE JIMMY-JAM?

16:12.967 --> 16:14.533
- DARA'S STEPMOM IS EVIL,

16:14.533 --> 16:16.700
AND SHE'S TRYING TO RUIN US
WITH DARA'S PHONE,

16:16.700 --> 16:18.333
FOLLOWERS,
AND SCRIPT.

16:18.333 --> 16:22.067
- WE HAVE TO JOIN FORCES TO END
HER EVIL REIGN OVER THIS LAND

16:22.067 --> 16:26.267
AND SET DARA FREE WITH MY KISS.

16:26.267 --> 16:28.167
- HE KNOWS WE'RE NOT IN
A COLORFUL WORLD

16:28.167 --> 16:30.733
OF MAKE-BELIEVE, RIGHT?

16:30.733 --> 16:34.400
- HEY,
WE JUST DID A YO GABBA CAMEO.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.933
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

16:35.933 --> 16:38.067
- WE'RE DOING A LITTLE REWRITE

16:38.067 --> 16:41.967
SO BIG TIME RUSH ROCKS THE STAGE
AND ROCKS COCO.O.

16:41.967 --> 16:43.967
- HMM.

16:43.967 --> 16:45.500
[bell rings]

16:47.600 --> 16:50.233
- CAN I HAVE EVERYONE'S
ATTENTION, PLEASE?

16:50.233 --> 16:52.633
IT LOOKS LIKE BIG TIME RUSH
IS NOT GONNA MAKE IT

16:52.633 --> 16:53.667
TO THE DANCE TONIGHT.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.067
[all groaning]

16:55.067 --> 17:00.267
- I KNEW SHE WAS A LIAR...
AND A ROBOT.

17:00.267 --> 17:04.200
[cheers and applause]

17:04.200 --> 17:06.500
[together]
SHE'S NOT A LIAR!

17:06.500 --> 17:09.433
- WE WERE JUST RUNNING
A LITTLE LATE TO THE JIMMY-JAM.

17:09.433 --> 17:12.100
[crowd cheering]

17:18.933 --> 17:21.833
- AND WE KNOW SHE IS NOT
A ROBOT.

17:23.867 --> 17:25.733
- OUT OF MY WAY.

17:25.733 --> 17:26.767
- PARDON ME.

17:26.767 --> 17:29.367
- YOU'RE BOTH FIRED.

17:29.367 --> 17:34.067
- IN FACT,
I THINK COCO...

17:34.067 --> 17:35.867
LOOKS LIKE A PRINCESS.

17:37.767 --> 17:40.167
all: OOH.

17:40.167 --> 17:42.067
- CUT!

17:42.067 --> 17:43.067
CUT THE CAMERAS.

17:43.067 --> 17:44.433
CUT THEM ALL.

17:44.433 --> 17:48.533
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?

17:48.533 --> 17:49.567
I CONTROL DARA.

17:49.567 --> 17:52.600
I TELL HER WHAT TO EAT,
WHAT TO SAY,

17:52.600 --> 17:54.733
AND WHO TO KISS.

17:54.733 --> 17:57.400
I'M THE BOSS, ALL RIGHT,
OF YOU,

17:57.400 --> 18:02.833
YOU, AND EVERYONE WHO WATCHES
THIS STUPID SHOW.

18:03.933 --> 18:06.400
[cell phone beeps]

18:06.400 --> 18:09.333

ALL RECORDED RIGHT HERE.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.433
[crowd gasps]

18:10.433 --> 18:13.500
- WHERE DID YOU GET
DARA'S PHONE?

18:13.500 --> 18:16.600
- OH,
I MIGHT HAVE BORROWED IT

18:16.600 --> 18:17.800
AND THEN GAVE IT TO THEM.

18:17.800 --> 18:21.300
- AND IF YOU DON'T WANT US
TO SEND THIS OUT

18:21.300 --> 18:24.767
TO DARA'S 14 MILLION FOLLOWERS

18:24.767 --> 18:26.200
EXPOSING YOU AS AN EVIL WITCH

18:26.200 --> 18:29.667

18:42.833 --> 18:47.133

DARA IS GROWING UP
AND CAN MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS.

18:51.833 --> 18:54.967
AND CARLOS SEEMS LIKE
A NICE BOY,

18:54.967 --> 19:00.400
SO WHY DOESN'T THE BEST TV CREW
