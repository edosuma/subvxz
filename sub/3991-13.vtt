WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:02.561
- Previously on Hannibal...

00:02.600 --> 00:06.138
- Georgia Madchen was murdered
by whoever killed Dr. Sutcliffe.

00:06.170 --> 00:08.730
- Dad? It's for you.
- They know.

00:08.770 --> 00:12.103
He said he got so close to
Garret Jacob Hobbs

00:12.140 --> 00:14.608
he was becoming him.
- My name is Will Graham.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.744
- You think he's mentally ill?
- Whoever killed Marissa Schuur

00:16.780 --> 00:21.240
and Cassie Boyle wanted to copy
how Garret Jacob Hobbs
killed his victims.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.680
- Now he has Hobbs' daughter.
- Who Hobbs intended to kill.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.745
- Mind ifI sit?
Did Hannibal tell you?

00:25.790 --> 00:28.657
- No, he didn't.
- How many people
have you killed?

00:28.690 --> 00:31.284
- Many more than your father.
- Are you going to kill me?

00:33.330 --> 00:34.319
(insects chirping)

00:58.250 --> 01:00.115
(gunshot)

01:47.370 --> 01:49.509
(catching his breath)

01:51.910 --> 01:54.208
(dog barking)

01:54.240 --> 01:56.242
- Oh!

03:04.650 --> 03:06.914
(vehicle approaching)

03:24.930 --> 03:26.932
- I went to Minnesota.

03:29.670 --> 03:31.661
I took Abigail.

03:34.810 --> 03:36.801
We went to Minnesota and...

03:40.650 --> 03:42.914
...she didn't come back with me.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.454
- Show me.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.641
- I don't remember
going to bed last night.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.608
But...

04:13.650 --> 04:15.015
I must have.

04:15.050 --> 04:18.486
I-I don't know, maybe

04:18.520 --> 04:22.456
I got up to let the dogs out,
and, and, and then--

04:22.490 --> 04:25.880
- When was the last
time you saw Abigail?
- I woke up, my feet were muddy.

04:25.930 --> 04:28.854
- Will. When was the _last time
you saw Abigail?

04:28.900 --> 04:30.891
- Yesterday.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.631
At her father's cabin.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.608
I had...

04:38.640 --> 04:40.631
an episode.

04:42.510 --> 04:46.048
Uh, she said something
was wrong with me.

04:47.650 --> 04:49.049
She was afraid of me.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.009
And she ran away.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.982
- What happened?

04:56.020 --> 04:58.488
Why was she afraid?

04:58.530 --> 05:01.624
- I hallucinated
that I killed her.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.562
But it wasn't real.

05:09.070 --> 05:11.402
I know it wasn't real.

05:27.090 --> 05:29.820
- Will, we have
to call Jack.

05:31.430 --> 05:32.988
You can't run from this.

05:33.030 --> 05:35.624
It'll only be worse.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.492
Get rest.

05:45.670 --> 05:49.037
***

06:07.700 --> 06:09.691
(radio chatter)

06:19.040 --> 06:20.678
(Sigh)

06:22.650 --> 06:25.505
- What are we gonna find
in Minnesota, Will?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.919
- I don't know.

06:33.490 --> 06:35.515
- Go ahead
and process him.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.754
(dog whimpering)

07:34.250 --> 07:36.889
- Right rear pocket.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.478
A leather wallet

07:38.520 --> 07:40.613
containing 17 dollars cash.

07:42.020 --> 07:44.124
- Right rear pocket.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.720
Leather wallet,
17 dollars cash.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.625
- Right front pocket.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.934
One folding knife.
- Right front pocket.

07:52.970 --> 07:54.961
Folding knife.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.216
- I can't do
the silent treatment.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.787
I can't pretend I don't know
you and I can't pretend

08:10.820 --> 08:13.618
we both don't know what
I'm finding under your nails.

08:17.060 --> 08:20.655
You called me once because
you didn't trust yourself
to know what was real.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.158
This blood is real, Will.
- I know.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.191
- Do you know how
it got there?

08:30.340 --> 08:33.673
- Not with any
certainty, no.

08:33.710 --> 08:36.873
- Certainty comes
from the evidence.

08:36.910 --> 08:39.140
I didn't want to find
any evrdence on you.

08:39.180 --> 08:41.546
I wanted to be certain
about who you are,

08:41.580 --> 08:45.118
but you can't even be
certain with yourself.
- Not anymore.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.256
- If you weren't certain with
yourself, you shouldn't
have been here.

08:48.290 --> 08:51.521
This is the FBI.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.189
- I thought
I would get better.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.634
- You always said you interpret
the evidence, so do it, Will.

09:03.770 --> 09:06.568
Interpret the evidence.

09:09.380 --> 09:12.645
- According
to the evidence...

09:18.090 --> 09:20.081
...I killed Abigail Hobbs.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.656
- We analyzed the tissue.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.793
It matched Abigail Hobbs.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.661
It was her ear,

09:30.700 --> 09:33.066
her blood under
Will's fingernails.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.069
Scratches on his arms
are all defenswe wounds,

09:36.100 --> 09:38.204
like she fought back.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.208
- Shut up.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.038
_ 1--
- Stop talking.

09:45.780 --> 09:47.839
"He won't get too close."

09:47.880 --> 09:50.246
You said you would
cover him.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.851
You could see he was breaking.
- Yes, I could.

09:53.890 --> 09:55.858
And I kept pushing him

09:55.890 --> 09:58.222
because he was
savmg lives, Alana.

10:00.130 --> 10:02.769
- Not Abigail Hobbs' life.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.291
- You look me
in the face and tell me

10:05.330 --> 10:07.764
that you couldn't see
that he was breaking?

10:07.800 --> 10:10.303
- Of course, I could see it.

10:10.340 --> 10:12.638
I told you not
to put him out there!

10:12.680 --> 10:14.898
- Every decision I made
concerning Will's mental health

10:14.940 --> 10:19.343
I made under advisement of
a respected psychiatrist,
who you recommended.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.884
- Hannibal had to know. He had
to see something was wrong.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.285
- Not until
it was too late.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.880
Just like everybody else.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.753
(Sigh)

10:29.790 --> 10:31.781
Hannibal said
that Will was

10:31.830 --> 10:33.798
exhibiting signs of dementia.

10:33.830 --> 10:36.151
- Dementia isn't a disease.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.293
It's a symptom of disease!

10:38.330 --> 10:41.959
We have to find out what's
cau5ing it and treat it!

10:42.000 --> 10:45.299
- The concern is that there may
not be anything to treat.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.433
Will had a brain scan.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.176
They found nothing.

10:50.210 --> 10:53.771
- Well, then they don't know
what they're looking for.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.746
This started with
Garret Jacob Hobbs.

10:58.790 --> 11:01.782
- Maybe Will just did
what Hobbs couldn't.

11:06.930 --> 11:09.023
He killed his daughter.

11:09.060 --> 11:12.735
- Abigail's blood
is on all of us.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.329
And so is Will's.

11:28.450 --> 11:31.248
(silence)

12:04.850 --> 12:06.215
- Hi.

12:06.250 --> 12:09.185
- Hi.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.997
- You're flushed.
You been yelling?

12:14.400 --> 12:17.324
- Screaming is more like it.
- I could use a good scream.

12:21.270 --> 12:23.909
I can feel one
perched under my chin.

12:23.940 --> 12:27.103
- Let it out.
- I'm afraid
that ifI started...

12:29.440 --> 12:31.408
...I wouldn't be able to stop.

12:31.450 --> 12:34.339
I'm surprised Jack
let you in here,

12:34.380 --> 12:36.940
given my romantic overtures.

12:38.350 --> 12:41.456
- Jack doesn't know
about your romantic overtures.

12:43.390 --> 12:44.982
Didn't know.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.203
- (whispering): I guess you
dodged a bullet with me.

12:58.610 --> 13:02.205
- I don't feel like
I dodged a bullet.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.813
I feel wounded.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.016
I've been in touch with,

13:16.060 --> 13:18.255
um, Animal Services.

13:18.290 --> 13:21.828
I'll go pick up your dogs
in a couple hours.

13:23.230 --> 13:27.462
I'll take them back
home with me...
(sniffling)

13:27.500 --> 13:29.832
and I'll take care
of them until...

13:32.010 --> 13:33.477
...whenever.

13:33.510 --> 13:36.877
- When_ever could be
a long time from now.

13:36.910 --> 13:40.414
- I'll take care of them
until then.

13:40.450 --> 13:43.385
- Thank you.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.551
- We have to do some tests.

13:50.590 --> 13:54.026
They'll be the standard
psychopathology tests.

13:54.060 --> 13:57.223
- I suppose you're gonna
ask me to draw a clock
while you're at it.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.190
- Did Hannibal
ask you to draw a clock?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.602
- Said it was an exercise...

14:06.210 --> 14:08.906
...to ground me
in the present moment.

14:10.580 --> 14:14.072
A handle to help me
hold on to reality.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.414
- Was the clock normal?

14:17.450 --> 14:20.453
- Would I be here if it wasn't?

14:27.360 --> 14:29.089
- Draw me a clock.

14:47.580 --> 14:51.346
_ - You see?
It's Just a normal clock.

14:55.090 --> 14:58.059
Telling the time
isn't my problem.

15:01.330 --> 15:03.469
(Sigh)

15:05.230 --> 15:08.961
- It's the least
of your problems.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.010
- Seems hard
to find words today.

15:30.290 --> 15:32.258
(Sigh)

15:32.290 --> 15:34.520
Despite the
overwhelming evidence,

15:34.560 --> 15:37.267
I find myself searching for ways

15:37.300 --> 15:39.598
that Abigail
could still be alive.

15:39.630 --> 15:43.031
- Grieving is
an individual process

15:43.070 --> 15:44.708
with a universal goal:

15:44.740 --> 15:47.709
the truest examination
of the meaning of life

15:47.740 --> 15:49.708
and the meaning
of its end.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.174
- I know what life means.

15:52.210 --> 15:55.247
We've existed
for a hundred thousand years.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.248
In that time,

15:57.290 --> 15:59.508
a hundred billion human lives

15:59.550 --> 16:01.711
have had beginnings and ends.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.457
- A hundred billion lives
haven't impacted yours,

16:05.490 --> 16:08.721
but clearly
Abigail Hobbs' life has,

16:08.760 --> 16:11.365
and you seem
surprised by that.

16:15.070 --> 16:18.335
- I never considered
having a child.

16:21.080 --> 16:25.073
But after meeting Abigail,
I understood the appeal.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.583
The opportunity
to guide and support,

16:30.620 --> 16:33.350
and in many ways, direct a life.

16:33.390 --> 16:36.609
- You were having
influence on her?

16:36.660 --> 16:39.549
- I was hoping I was.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.323
- Young people are
supposed to be the lenses

16:44.370 --> 16:47.567
through which we see ourselves
living beyond this life.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.058
- I think of my earliest memory

16:51.110 --> 16:55.069
and project forward to what
I imagine will be my death.

16:55.110 --> 16:59.103
I never think about living
beyond that span of time.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.718
Except by reputation.

17:02.750 --> 17:05.139
- Even after this loss?

17:07.420 --> 17:09.513
- More so after this loss.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.654
-_ Will Graham
is a loss, too.

17:12.690 --> 17:15.591
You might grieve
him as a loss.

17:15.630 --> 17:17.598
- I haven't given up on Will.

17:17.630 --> 17:20.565
- If they do
find him guilty

17:20.600 --> 17:22.158
of killing
Abigail Hobbs...

17:22.200 --> 17:23.565
- When.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.306
Let's be honest.

17:26.340 --> 17:28.831
- I don't recommend

17:28.880 --> 17:32.543
you participate in any
rehabilitation effort.

17:37.350 --> 17:40.410
- I was so confident
in my ability to help him...

17:42.390 --> 17:43.755
...to solve him.

17:43.790 --> 17:46.122
- To save him.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.789
- Saving him,

17:52.830 --> 17:55.139
I lost Abigail.

17:56.670 --> 17:59.639
It's hard to accept
that I could fail them both

17:59.670 --> 18:01.672
so profoundly.

18:16.820 --> 18:19.584
- OK, Jimmy, what have you got?
- Um, as you know,

18:19.630 --> 18:22.258
Will is a big fly fisherman,
and he designs

18:22.300 --> 18:24.564
all of his own lures.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.363
Most anglers use feathers, fur,

18:26.400 --> 18:28.391
twine, bits of shell.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.364
They design each lure
to catch a specific fish.

18:31.410 --> 18:34.538
- This one caught my eye.
I noticed the hair color.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.901
Took me a few to accept
what I was seeing.

18:36.940 --> 18:40.239
I ran a chem-set to confirm
the connection.
- What connection?

18:40.280 --> 18:44.239
- Four of the lures_
_are made from materials
including human remains.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.508
- And we have a DNA match
for all of them.

18:46.550 --> 18:48.415
- This one is Cassie Boyle.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.657
Bits of bone fragments
and pieces of lung.

18:51.690 --> 18:54.454
Marissa Schuur. Antler velvet,

18:54.500 --> 18:57.890
a fingernail wound
with her hair. Doctor Sutcliffe.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.637
Crushed teeth, soft tissue
from inside his mouth,

19:00.670 --> 19:04.504
bound with
cartilage from his jaw.
- All victims of the copycat?

19:04.540 --> 19:07.373
- And this last lure
was made with hair and fiber

19:07.410 --> 19:11.278
that matches Georgia Madchen.
- He took trophies of
all his victims.

19:11.310 --> 19:14.711
- Trophies. So now Will Graham's
a serial killer who
takes trophies?

19:14.750 --> 19:17.719
- Something's wrong with Will
physically, neurologically.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.615
He's not a serial killer.

19:27.230 --> 19:29.357
(animal trotting)

19:56.660 --> 19:58.252
- You're sick, Will.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.428
- I-I wasn't consistent

20:04.470 --> 20:06.722
with taking my antibiotics.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.738
The fever came back.

20:08.770 --> 20:11.603
- We're gonna move you
to a secure medical ward.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.904
We're gonna get to the bottom
of whatever it is that's wrong

20:13.940 --> 20:16.500
with you, and we're
gonna make sure

20:16.540 --> 20:19.247
that you get whatever kind
of treatment you need.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.816
- And then what?

20:22.420 --> 20:25.412
Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane?

20:26.950 --> 20:29.987
Have Chilton fumbling
around in my head?

20:30.020 --> 20:34.389
- This job doesn't generally
lend itself to optimism,
all right?

20:34.430 --> 20:36.728
But I desperately
want to be optimistic

20:36.760 --> 20:40.639
about an alternative to what
every fiber of the eVIdence
is telling me you've done.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.707
- I can't confess to something
I don't remember.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.708
- The question is,

20:45.740 --> 20:48.903
how much more is there
that you don't remember?

20:50.550 --> 20:53.269
We found your fishing lures.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.776
- Yeah, I should hope so.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.846
They, they were on my desk
right by the front door.

20:59.890 --> 21:01.983
- We found human remains

21:02.020 --> 21:05.854
amongst the materials
that you made them from.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.688
The human remains
of Cassie Boyle, Marissa Schuur,

21:08.730 --> 21:12.723
Donald Sutcliffe,
Georgia Madchen.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.966
- (whispering): No.

21:20.010 --> 21:21.830
- Yes.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.871
- (whispering): I wasn't...

21:26.350 --> 21:29.444
_I wasn't sick when
CaSS|e Boyle was murdered.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.984
I wasn't sick when Marissa
Schuur was murdered.

21:33.020 --> 21:35.750
- That's not an argument
you want to be making right now.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.759
Not with me.

21:42.130 --> 21:44.860
- Because then
I'd be a psychopath.

21:44.900 --> 21:48.461
- My biggest fear
is that we'll learn

21:48.500 --> 21:51.469
that you knew what
you were doing the whole time.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.001
- Hey, you don't have to be
afraid of that, Jack.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.976
There is something
you should be afraid of, though.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.649
- Yeah? What's that?
- Whoever's doing this to me.

22:07.050 --> 22:08.984
- Someone's doing this to you?

22:09.020 --> 22:11.488
- They'll be close to you.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.589
It could be someone here.

22:13.630 --> 22:15.996
Working with you.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.089
- So that's it? It's a setup?

22:18.130 --> 22:19.722
- They know the cases.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.461
They know forensics.

22:26.870 --> 22:28.576
They know that I'm unstable.

22:28.610 --> 22:31.670
- Can you hear
how paranoid you sound?

22:33.080 --> 22:36.675
- Or it could just be you.

22:38.050 --> 22:40.655
Then I'd be really
screwed, wouldn't I?

22:47.530 --> 22:50.795
- I wanted to be
the one to do this.

22:53.470 --> 22:56.860
Will Graham,
you're under arrest for murder.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.767
You have the right
to remain silent.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.991
He disarmed his guard.

23:57.030 --> 23:59.669
He threw the guard and
the driver from the vehicle.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.464
We found the ambulance
in an alley in Dumfries.

24:02.500 --> 24:06.504
These are not the actions
of an innocent man.

24:06.540 --> 24:09.134
- They're the actions
of a man who's impaired.

24:09.180 --> 24:12.172
I had Will draw a clock to test
for cognitive dysfunction.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.041
- That is extreme.

24:19.090 --> 24:22.981
Now, this is the clock
he drew for me two weeks ago.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.229
It's normal.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.129
- What disease
progresses gradually

24:33.170 --> 24:35.229
but plateaus
for lengths of time?

24:35.270 --> 24:37.966
- Will has periods of clarity.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.501
_ We've seen him
luad and aware one moment

24:40.540 --> 24:41.905
and then the next he's not.

24:41.940 --> 24:45.899
- Could be some form
of encephalitis.

24:45.950 --> 24:48.976
- Autoimmune encephalitis?
- It's hard to diagnose.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.045
There are no tumors,
no lesions.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.718
It wouldn't even show up
on a brain scan unless
you were looking for it.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.558
- Look, just tell me if he
could kill five people
and not be aware of it.

24:58.660 --> 25:01.629
This doesn't feel
like dementia.

25:01.660 --> 25:04.026
This is an intelligent
psychopath.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.026
Look, this killer

25:06.070 --> 25:10.029
called the Hobbs' house.
He warned Abigail's father.

25:10.070 --> 25:12.163
- I was with Will
that entire time.

25:12.210 --> 25:16.101
- Did he have an opportunity
to make a phone call?
- Before we went

25:16.140 --> 25:18.608
to interview Garret Jacob Hobbs,
he was alone in the office while

25:18.650 --> 25:22.541
I was outside loading the car
with the files, but that was
only for a few minutes.

25:23.950 --> 25:26.612
- Dumb luck and
bad bookkeeping.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.016
That's how Will said
he caught Hobbs.

25:29.060 --> 25:31.051
Now how would you say
he caught him?

25:33.060 --> 25:35.756
- We were looking
through the files

25:35.800 --> 25:38.894
and it was as if
Will plucked his name

25:38.930 --> 25:42.297
out of a hat, based on little
more than an incomplete address.

25:42.340 --> 25:45.036
- Let me play the devil here
for a moment, doctor.

25:45.070 --> 25:49.029
This clock test, could Will
fake something like this?

25:49.080 --> 25:51.674
Would he be able to do that?

25:54.220 --> 25:56.939
- Yes.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.969
- Hello, Will.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.338
How are you feeling?

26:22.380 --> 26:24.746
- Self-aware.

26:26.380 --> 26:28.314
- You frightened Alana Bloom.

26:28.350 --> 26:30.944
- She's confused about
who I am...

26:32.320 --> 26:34.982
...which I can relate to.

26:36.390 --> 26:39.029
Are you confused about who I am?

26:39.060 --> 26:41.790
- I'm not confused.
I'm skeptical.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.169
Meaning I'm willing to change my
mind should the evidence change.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.033
- Do you believe
I killed Abigail?

26:49.070 --> 26:52.164
- I believe it's
entirely pOSSlble,

26:52.210 --> 26:55.179
if not nearly indisputable,

26:55.210 --> 26:57.906
based on how you
discovered her ear.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.906
- If it was just Abigail,

26:59.950 --> 27:02.214
I would have believed.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.884
I would have believed
that I got so far

27:08.920 --> 27:11.650
inside Hobbs' head
I couldn't get out.

27:11.690 --> 27:14.693
- But it wasn't just Abigail.

27:17.330 --> 27:19.298
- I know who I am.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.195
- No.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.903
All sense of who you are has
been distorted by your illness.

27:24.940 --> 27:27.636
You know who you are
in this moment.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.201
That's not always
the case, Will.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.117
- I didn't kill any of 'em.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.738
And somebody

27:38.790 --> 27:41.281
is making sure

27:41.320 --> 27:43.652
that no one believes me.

27:45.060 --> 27:48.029
- If we're to prove you
didn't commit these murders,

27:48.060 --> 27:51.063
perhaps we should consider
how you could have.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.668
And then disprove that.

27:57.070 --> 27:58.765
If you are this killer,

27:58.810 --> 28:02.177
that identity runs
through these events

28:02.210 --> 28:04.178
like a thread
through pearls.

28:04.210 --> 28:07.668
Cassie Boyle would have been
your first victim.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.312
You said her crime scene was
practically gift-wrapped.

28:24.270 --> 28:27.068
- It told me everything
I needed to know

28:27.100 --> 28:29.068
to catch Garret Jacob Hobbs.

28:29.100 --> 28:32.069
- You had seen one of Hobbs'
victims. You knew how he killed.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.170
You may have been
exploring how he killed

28:35.210 --> 28:38.179
to better understand who he was.

28:38.210 --> 28:41.418
- I wasn't in Minnesota when
CaSS|e Boyle was murdered.

28:41.450 --> 28:45.409
- She disappeared on a Saturday.
She was found on a Monday.

28:45.450 --> 28:48.317
You would've had the weekend

28:48.360 --> 28:50.316
to do your work.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.079
- (whispering): I know
I didn't kill her.

28:53.130 --> 28:54.950
- How do you know?

28:55.000 --> 28:58.367
What did you think when
you first met Marissa Schuur?

28:58.400 --> 29:01.494
How much like Abigail she was?

29:01.540 --> 29:04.361
Same height, same weight,

29:04.410 --> 29:07.777
hair color, same age.

29:07.810 --> 29:11.246
- How could I resist?
- So much like his daughter.

29:11.280 --> 29:15.011
You may have wondered
why Garret Jacob Hobbs
didn't kill her himself.

29:15.050 --> 29:17.780
Dr. Sutcliffe wasn't killed

29:17.820 --> 29:19.947
how Garret Jacob Hobbs killed.

29:22.090 --> 29:24.923
He was murdered
how you imagined yourself

29:24.960 --> 29:28.418
murdering a woman
only days before.

29:28.460 --> 29:31.793
- How Georgia Madchen killed.

29:31.830 --> 29:34.298
She dreamt she saw me
killing Sutcliffe.

29:34.340 --> 29:38.106
But she couldn't see my face.
And then she was murdered.

29:38.140 --> 29:41.974
- You catch these killers
by getting into their heads,

29:42.010 --> 29:44.069
but you also allow them

29:44.110 --> 29:46.874
into your own.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.913
I'm trying to help you, Will.

29:53.450 --> 29:56.055
- Then take me to Minnesota.

29:58.260 --> 30:01.093
I want to see
where Abigail died.

30:07.970 --> 30:10.962
(soft classical music)

30:26.950 --> 30:30.454
- Have you had any contact
with Hannibal Lecter
in the last 24 hours?

30:30.490 --> 30:33.425
- He didn't make his session
this morning and he didn't

30:33.460 --> 30:35.997
call in, which he would
consider rude.

30:36.030 --> 30:38.260
Is something wrong?
- I'm on my way to Minnesota.

30:38.300 --> 30:41.861
I believe that Will Graham
has taken Hannibal
Lecter to Minnesota.

30:41.900 --> 30:46.200
- Will thinks he's being framed
for these murders. He's slipping
in and out of delusion.

30:46.240 --> 30:50.131
He could kill Hannibal
and not even know he's doing it.

30:50.180 --> 30:53.001
- If anyone could've
helped Mr. Graham, it
would've been Hannibal.

30:55.020 --> 30:58.410
In fact, he may still be trying.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.361
(phone ringing)

31:19.940 --> 31:22.238
- Hello?

31:22.280 --> 31:25.374
Just a second. Dad?

31:25.410 --> 31:26.968
It's for you.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.149
Caller ID said it was blocked.

31:34.420 --> 31:37.617
- Hello?
- Hannibal: [Will?]

31:37.660 --> 31:41.391
- Yes.
- Hannibal: [Will?]

31:43.400 --> 31:45.129
We're here.

32:05.050 --> 32:07.280
- Are we gonna
re-enact the crime?

32:07.320 --> 32:09.959
You be my dad,
you be my mom,

32:09.990 --> 32:12.379
and you be the man
on the phone.

32:20.130 --> 32:22.269
- Are we gonna
re-enact the crime?

32:22.300 --> 32:25.337
- If that would help you.

32:52.530 --> 32:55.761
It's as if Abigail was supposed
to die in this kitchen.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.132
- Her throat was cut.

32:58.170 --> 33:00.229
She lost

33:00.270 --> 33:01.999
great gouts of blood.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.268
There's an unmistakable

33:06.310 --> 33:08.278
arterial spray.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.641
- They haven't found her body.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.238
- Just the one piece.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.349
- If you were
in Garret Jacob Hobbs'

33:14.390 --> 33:17.086
frame of mind when
you killed her,

33:17.120 --> 33:19.350
they may never find her.

33:19.390 --> 33:22.154
- 'Cause I honored
every part of her?

33:22.200 --> 33:25.567
- Perhaps you didn't come here
looking for a killer.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.763
Perhaps you came here
to find yourself.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.132
_You_killed a man
in this very room.

33:33.770 --> 33:36.102
- I stared at Hobbs...

33:38.110 --> 33:40.340
...and the space opposite me

33:40.380 --> 33:44.089
assumed the shape of a man

33:44.120 --> 33:47.715
filled with dark
and swarming flies.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.151
Then I scattered them.

33:55.430 --> 33:59.161
- At a time when other men
fear their isolation,

33:59.200 --> 34:02.795
yours has become
understandable to you.

34:05.570 --> 34:07.663
You are alone

34:07.710 --> 34:10.270
because you are unique.

34:10.310 --> 34:13.143
- I'm as alone as you are.

34:13.180 --> 34:16.069
- If you followed the urges
you kept down for so long,

34:16.120 --> 34:18.418
cultivated them

34:18.450 --> 34:21.556
as the inspirations they are,

34:21.590 --> 34:24.286
you would have become

34:24.330 --> 34:26.423
someone other than yourself.

34:27.830 --> 34:30.298
- (whispering): I know who I am.

34:37.570 --> 34:39.629
I'm not so sure

34:39.670 --> 34:43.231
that I know who you are anymore.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.608
But I am certain...

34:47.650 --> 34:50.471
one of us killed Abigail.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.648
- Whoever that was
killed the others.

35:04.730 --> 35:06.561
Are you a killer, Will?

35:06.600 --> 35:09.296
You?

35:09.340 --> 35:12.138
Right now. This man
standing in front of me.

35:12.170 --> 35:15.571
Is this who you really are?

35:15.610 --> 35:18.170
- I am who I've always been.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.312
The scales have just
fallen from my eyes.

35:27.190 --> 35:29.579
I can see you now.

35:31.190 --> 35:33.181
- What do you see?

35:34.600 --> 35:36.556
- You called here that morning.

35:36.600 --> 35:39.421
Abigail knew.

35:39.470 --> 35:43.531
And you kept her secrets...

35:43.570 --> 35:45.936
until... until what?

35:45.970 --> 35:47.938
Until she found out
some of yours?

35:47.970 --> 35:51.940
- You said it felt good
to kill Garret Jacob Hobbs.

35:51.980 --> 35:55.279
Would it feel good
to kill me now?

35:55.320 --> 35:57.413
- Oh, Garret Jacob Hobbs
was a murderer.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.589
Are you a murderer, Dr. Lecter?

36:01.260 --> 36:03.251
- What reason would I have?

36:12.230 --> 36:16.337
- You, you have
no traceable motive...

36:19.570 --> 36:22.334
...which is why you were
so hard to see.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.446
You were just...

36:27.580 --> 36:29.878
...curious what I would do.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.548
Someone like me.

36:32.590 --> 36:35.718
Someone who thinks
how I think.

36:37.460 --> 36:39.382
Wind him up...

36:40.790 --> 36:43.623
...and watch him go.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.969
And apparently,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.264
Dr. Lecter...

36:48.300 --> 36:50.439
this is how I go.

36:50.470 --> 36:52.199
- Will.

36:53.610 --> 36:54.838
Easy.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.628
- See?

37:15.660 --> 37:18.629
You see?

37:22.870 --> 37:26.658
(monitor beeping)

37:30.880 --> 37:34.316
- Right hemisphere
of his brain was inflamed.

37:34.350 --> 37:36.568
They have placed him
in an induced sleep

37:36.620 --> 37:39.839
and they are treating him with
antiviral and steroid therapies.

37:39.890 --> 37:42.586
- Is he responding?

37:42.620 --> 37:44.884
- More or less.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.955
He's expected to make

37:46.990 --> 37:48.958
a substantial recovery.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.697
- Would you have gone
to Minnesota with him

37:57.000 --> 37:59.969
- I would have wanted to.

38:06.110 --> 38:09.409
I believe I've failed to satisfy
my obligation to Will,

38:09.450 --> 38:11.987
more than I care to admit.

38:12.020 --> 38:15.751
- Well, he's not
your victim, Doctor.

38:15.790 --> 38:18.850
- Nor is he yours.

38:20.730 --> 38:23.949
- You know, in my time I've seen
people broken by the world.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.663
I've seen them broken
in all kinds of hideous

38:27.700 --> 38:29.839
and offhanded ways,
but never like this.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.598
Never like this.

38:38.480 --> 38:43.577
- No one in this room
will be the same.

38:51.990 --> 38:55.596
Good evening.
- Hello, Hannibal.

38:55.630 --> 38:57.791
Please come in.

38:57.830 --> 39:00.799
- Tte de veau en sauce verte.

39:00.830 --> 39:02.832
- Smells like a bonfire.

39:02.870 --> 39:05.964
- I smoked the veal
on a pyre of dry hay.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.966
It imparts a unique

39:08.010 --> 39:10.672
smoldering flavor to the meat

39:10.710 --> 39:12.940
and to the room.

39:12.980 --> 39:16.017
- This is
an unexpected treat.

39:19.050 --> 39:21.553
- Thank you for indulging me.

39:21.590 --> 39:24.627
- You seemed like
you needed to talk.

39:24.660 --> 39:27.857
- And since you refuse
invitations to my dinner table,

39:27.890 --> 39:32.429
this is the only way
I could cook for you.
- What's on your mind, Hannibal?

39:39.040 --> 39:42.703
- I'm going to see
Will tomorrow.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.901
- As a patient,

39:44.950 --> 39:46.906
or as a friend?

39:46.950 --> 39:49.475
- As a farewell.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.147
Of sorts.

39:51.180 --> 39:55.150
- I thought Mr. Graham
was finally going to be

39:55.190 --> 39:57.658
the patient
who cost you your life.

39:57.690 --> 39:59.749
- He didn't cost me my life.

39:59.790 --> 40:03.157
He cost Abigail hers.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.760
Your veal is getting cold.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.439
- Controversial dish.

40:08.470 --> 40:09.994
Veal.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.802
Mmm.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.516
- Those who denounce veal
often Cite the young age

40:25.550 --> 40:27.916
at which the animals are killed,
when they are in fact

40:27.950 --> 40:30.180
older than many pigs
going to slaughter.

40:31.790 --> 40:34.623
- You have to be
careful, Hannibal.

40:34.660 --> 40:38.426
They're starting
to see your pattern.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.963
- What pattern would that be?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.560
- You develop relationships

40:44.610 --> 40:47.738
with patients who are prone
to violence.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.132
That pattern.

40:51.180 --> 40:53.842
Under scrutiny,

40:53.880 --> 40:56.110
Jack Crawford's
beliefs about you

40:56.150 --> 40:58.710
might start to unravel.

40:58.750 --> 41:02.151
- Tell me, Dr. Du Maurier...

41:03.760 --> 41:13.795
...have your beliefs
about me begun to unravel?

41:13.800 --> 41:19.705
...have your beliefs
about me begun to unravel?

41:19.740 --> 41:22.607
***
(opera song)

41:47.600 --> 41:49.136
- Hello, Will.

42:09.960 --> 42:12.087
- Hello, Dr. Lecter.
