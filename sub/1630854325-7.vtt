WEBVTT

00:19.478 --> 00:20.729
Lin?

00:20.812 --> 00:23.023
He has been vomiting for the last
five hours.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.317
I don't know what to do.
The hospital won't take him.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.653
They said with 3 to 4 days full rest
and with plenty of water,

00:27.736 --> 00:30.697
-he'll be better in no time.
-Jitendra, can you hear me?

00:30.781 --> 00:32.908
Lin, where have you been, man?
Come fast. Parvati is--

00:32.991 --> 00:35.619
Parvati can wait!
Look at my mister's condition.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.746
She's in the same state as your mister.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.331
Go to hell, Prabhu!

00:39.414 --> 00:41.959
My baby was brought here before Parvati.

00:42.835 --> 00:43.669
Prabhu!

00:43.752 --> 00:46.380
-Can't you see my Jitendra's sick?
-Prabhu!

00:48.715 --> 00:51.009
What's going on, mate?
How many people are like this?

00:51.093 --> 00:52.094
Everyone is sick.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.721
But Parvati is sick also.
Please, hurry! Come fast!

00:54.805 --> 00:56.932
Okay. Okay. I'm coming.
I'm coming. All right?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.770
Guys, move. Go out and clear the air.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.940
Jitendra, lay back.

01:35.888 --> 01:39.933
I need you to make sure this stays secure.

01:40.851 --> 01:41.852
All right?

01:50.319 --> 01:53.197
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Why are you still here?

01:53.280 --> 01:56.825
-Go home! Lurking around here…
-Okay. Come with me. Come with me.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.785
-…won't make her better!
-Sorry, huh? Sorry!

02:05.083 --> 02:07.294
Why is God punishing her like this?

02:07.377 --> 02:09.922
Is this a warning?
"Stay away from that haramkhor, Prabhu"?

02:10.005 --> 02:11.215
Is that what God is saying?

02:11.298 --> 02:13.217
We should never have gone
behind their backs.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.136
-This is all of my fault, Linbaba.
-She's not the only one.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.055
-Are you to blame for all of them?
-Please.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.015
You don't say this, okay?
You are going also.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.142
-What will we do when you leave?
-I'm not going anywhere.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.852
Only because you're needing
a passport to go.

02:23.936 --> 02:26.063
When you have it, then what?
You won't leave or what?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.607
I'm not leaving for the next two days,
no matter what.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.112
Excuse me. Excuse me.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.572
I do not understand.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.325
-It is such a simple task to boil water--
-Qasim.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.245
Qasim! I think this might be cholera.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.205
All the symptoms fit,
and the way it's spreading.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.124
Yes. There've been three other outbreaks
between here and Thane.

02:46.208 --> 02:49.002
I am telling you, Johnny,
the most important thing will be salt.

02:49.086 --> 02:52.297
-Salt and rice.
-Hey. Hey. We need to start making a plan.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.383
I don't have enough supplies
to treat everyone.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.552
Mr. Lin, we have seen this before.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.220
Show this list to your brother.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.722
We already have chores for everyone,
including yourself.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.225
Linbaba, chalo.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.561
The most important thing is to explain

03:05.644 --> 03:08.397
that each person, even the elderly,
do their part.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.786
Dear, let's go for breakfast.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.581
I am hungry.

03:26.415 --> 03:29.751
I will have breakfast in the bed only.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.503
This bed isn't big enough.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.464
I am ready for a full breakfast.

03:40.846 --> 03:45.851
Butter, toast, jam, dosa.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.312
Chai? Coffee?

03:48.395 --> 03:51.648
-Leave it outside.
-No, wait. Ai.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.928
Sunita, darling, please come back inside.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.932
Don't be nervous.

04:25.015 --> 04:28.810
You know you cannot be seen with me.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.271
We're so far from Bombay.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.690
You think anyone here knows or cares

04:33.774 --> 04:37.486
what you or your wife look like,
Mr. Pandey?

04:38.529 --> 04:42.241
Very well. You don't want gossip, right?

04:43.158 --> 04:46.119
Then hire me as your secretary.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.454
When we move to Canada.

04:48.247 --> 04:53.001
His career has not yet started
and he is talking about moving to Canada.

04:53.919 --> 04:59.341
Now you took this money from Walidbhai,
you are stuck in India forever.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.678
My dear, it's difficult.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.723
I love you.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.142
You know this, right?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.603
Let's have a little more fun.

05:20.863 --> 05:23.198
The whole of Sagar Wada went to work,

05:23.282 --> 05:25.659
knowing that no help was coming
but their own.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.079
And I was the nearest thing
to a real doctor they'd see.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.957
A fugitive paramedic
totally out of my depth.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.681
Give one to Ratna Auntie and one to Lily.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.808
Ravi, you take one for Manu and Pinky.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.519
Give one to Jitu. Go, go, go!

05:52.603 --> 05:54.396
They must drink it. Tell them.

06:05.991 --> 06:10.245
One, two, three. Take the rest.
Hurry up, hurry up!

06:10.829 --> 06:12.789
Bring back all the empty bottles.

06:14.249 --> 06:18.462
-Why did you give this back? Run!
-Send the good-for-nothing.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.924
Cut him some slack, Kumar ji.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.510
She means the world to him too.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.160
Thank you. Thank you.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.000
Hi. Can I get two, please?

07:04.091 --> 07:07.302
I got us eggs today.
Thought I could make us an omelet.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.179
You make some coffee?

07:11.348 --> 07:13.684
So, you're gonna act
like it's just another day?

07:14.685 --> 07:18.313
If you have a problem, Sebastian,
then why didn't you say so to Maurizio?

07:18.397 --> 07:20.858
I said you could say no.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.235
Well, maybe I wanted you to say no.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.280
For me.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.534
But what do you do? Nothing.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.665
I don't give a shit about Raheem.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.168
But I had to step up
because one of us has to.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.920
And if me fucking him
will get us out of here for good,

07:42.004 --> 07:43.130
then so be it.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.596
I sleep with you.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.016
Wake up with you.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.352
Eat breakfast with you.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.444
And I won't kiss him either,
'cause I don't do that.

08:06.361 --> 08:09.364
I'll do my job, and then I'll leave.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.382
Go.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.887
Before I turn this car around
and take you back to Khandala.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.057
Get out.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.421
Ten kilos? That is a big shipment.

09:06.505 --> 09:10.425
-Can you not deliver that much?
-Don't forget who works for who.

09:10.509 --> 09:11.969
I can deliver.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.680
But such large amounts draw attention.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.141
Who knows where you get the brown sugar?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.561
Only my partner, Modena.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.692
What about the American whore, Lisa?

09:27.317 --> 09:29.611
She doesn't know anything.
Modena likes to fuck her, that's all.

09:30.612 --> 09:36.326
If this ever comes back to me, Maurizio,
then Padma will take your balls.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.452
Remember that.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.749
Well, if Khaderbhai finds out,
then Padma won't get the chance.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.629
So, can we deliver, or no?

09:57.806 --> 10:00.392
-You have another?
-Here.

10:02.436 --> 10:06.565
We have to give her two sips
every two minutes.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.098
Sunita! Sunita, up here!

10:40.182 --> 10:44.436
You look happy! How was it?

10:59.201 --> 11:00.410
She's a whore.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.038
I followed her all the way to the brothel.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.749
A mistress is one thing,
but an affair with a low-caste whore

11:05.832 --> 11:07.668
gives us much bigger leverage.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.671
If Walid finds out about this randi,
he'll kill her in a second.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.924
He can't risk Pandey being removed
from his position.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.509
Abdullah's right.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.970
The girl needs to be somewhere safe,
under our control,

11:18.053 --> 11:20.514
if we wanna use her against Pandey.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.808
We must do this
without attracting attention.

11:23.392 --> 11:26.311
We need someone who can buy a prostitute
without suspicion.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.399
Call in the debt Madame Zhou owes you.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.234
Make her take the girl to the Palace.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.070
No. There has to be another way.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.573
You have a better idea? Let's hear it.

11:37.656 --> 11:40.617
You've clearly discussed this plan
before I got here.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.619
So does it matter what I think?

11:43.745 --> 11:45.247
Abdullah raised it, yes.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.291
But now we're discussing it again
with you.

11:49.376 --> 11:53.505
Karla, we will not do anything
you cannot live with.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.386
-When do we get more water?
-Tuesday.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.808
Allah is with those who are patient.

12:05.767 --> 12:09.479
Allah's happy to make 30,000 people
wait three days for more water?

12:09.563 --> 12:11.648
No, but the city is.

12:12.691 --> 12:16.737
Mr. Lin, cholera is a battle
we fight with every year,

12:16.820 --> 12:19.198
and we do all we can
to save those we can save.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.367
But who needs a doctor
when we have you, huh?

12:22.451 --> 12:24.494
I'm not a real doctor, Qasimbhai.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.747
So? Do I look like a real bhai?

12:27.998 --> 12:30.959
Chalo, you are a jugaad doctor.

12:31.627 --> 12:34.671
-But what in Sagar Wada is not jugaad?
-What's jugaad?

12:35.589 --> 12:39.676
Jugaad is to improvise
with whatever one has.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.930
It's a very Bombay word
for a very Bombay way of life.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.128
For good luck. We are needing it.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.903
One car only?

13:41.280 --> 13:44.449
He would come with more
if he knew about the heroin.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.788
If he came to kill me.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.424
Go. Greet them.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.399
All good, child?

14:20.569 --> 14:23.780
I mean it when I say
we can find another way.

14:23.864 --> 14:28.035
Remember our conversation.
If there is too much sin in the crime…

14:31.079 --> 14:32.497
Let's just get this done.

14:42.633 --> 14:47.846
So, you're asking me to take in this girl,
give her a nice room, good food,

14:47.930 --> 14:49.223
all paid for by you?

14:49.306 --> 14:51.975
Do this and consider your debt paid.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.978
A small price in exchange
for your life, hai na?

14:59.942 --> 15:03.612
Then what are you not
telling me, Khaderbhai?

15:03.695 --> 15:06.156
About this randi?

15:06.949 --> 15:09.117
I have told you all you need to know.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.746
But you don't want anyone
to connect you to her

15:12.829 --> 15:15.374
or question why she goes
from one place to another?

15:15.457 --> 15:18.293
You're well-known
for catering to all tastes.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.838
You must recruit from Kamathipura
from time to time?

15:22.005 --> 15:25.425
You seem well-educated
in the nature of Bombay whores.

15:26.552 --> 15:29.388
Perhaps someone can educate me
what you are doing here.

15:29.471 --> 15:32.057
Can you do this or not?

15:33.892 --> 15:34.893
Of course.

15:36.144 --> 15:40.440
But Kamathipura is known for quantity,
not quality.

15:40.524 --> 15:43.694
The girls there are… disposable.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.947
I suggest,
if you want to hide your intent,

15:47.030 --> 15:49.950
that we buy several of these randis.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.035
Fewer people will ask fewer questions.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.830
All right. As you see fit.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.541
Padma.

16:04.256 --> 16:07.050
Karla will remain here
to see it is done right.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.303
She speaks with my voice.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.889
And how long has she been speaking
that way?

16:18.145 --> 16:20.105
Will it be a problem?

16:22.065 --> 16:23.233
Not at all.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.363
Sebastian, you can go now. Please.

17:11.323 --> 17:14.910
I'll be downstairs.
I'm staying until you're done.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.089
Good evening.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.940
I've been looking forward to seeing you.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.321
And the wait was definitely worth it.

17:54.283 --> 17:57.244
Can I get you something?
A drink? Champagne?

18:02.583 --> 18:03.959
Take off your clothes.

18:17.931 --> 18:18.932
Jeetu.

18:19.474 --> 18:22.561
Jeetu, Jeetu! Jeetu? Jeetu!

18:25.689 --> 18:27.816
Okay. Let me see. Let me see, Ratna.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.714
Jeetu. Jeetu!

19:51.358 --> 19:53.068
It's a Da Hong Pao.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.905
Only the best for my most honored guests.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.741
You really think
your clients care about the tea?

20:00.701 --> 20:03.453
They pay for it,
whether they drink it or not.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.582
What do you think I sell here?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.502
Sex, of course…

20:13.714 --> 20:15.841
but mostly it's mystery,

20:15.924 --> 20:17.217
exoticism,

20:18.302 --> 20:21.263
a taste of the unattainable.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.517
Men fly around the world

20:25.601 --> 20:31.440
to sample the pleasures of a certain girl
trained a certain way.

20:33.692 --> 20:37.696
That's why I can't let them walk out
anytime they feel like it.

20:38.697 --> 20:42.159
I invest time and resources in them,

20:42.951 --> 20:45.996
same as Khader did in Rujul.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.080
Or you, perhaps.

20:47.164 --> 20:49.583
You don't need to justify yourself to me.

20:50.709 --> 20:53.003
You're right. I don't.

20:54.838 --> 20:57.007
You told Khader about Rujul.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.261
Lisa told you, and you told Khader.

21:01.345 --> 21:02.346
Yes.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.351
He pretended not to know you.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.105
He's good. I believed him.

21:14.066 --> 21:16.527
I wonder what lies he tells you.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.198
You put my life in his hands.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.450
You want me to apologize?

21:27.120 --> 21:30.582
You hate me
for doing the same thing you did.

21:30.666 --> 21:33.460
-Punishing a betrayal.
-I didn't kill Rujul.

21:37.047 --> 21:40.008
And I did not kill your old friend Ahmed.

21:40.092 --> 21:41.218
Not personally.

21:43.428 --> 21:45.264
Come. Drink.

21:46.390 --> 21:49.935
You can hate me
and still not let the tea go to waste.

22:00.445 --> 22:04.241
I couldn't stand the sheer pain
and fear and waste of it all.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.995
Shame and sorrow threatened
to overwhelm me.

22:08.662 --> 22:09.788
Jugaad wasn't enough…

22:09.872 --> 22:11.582
-Lin!
-…it was never going to be enough.

22:11.665 --> 22:14.835
Lin, she's not getting better.
There must be something you can do.

22:14.918 --> 22:17.671
-Please, promise me you can save her--
-Did I save Jitendra?

22:18.755 --> 22:20.174
Did I save Lakshmi?

22:21.258 --> 22:24.011
-What makes you think I can save Parvati?
-You can try. Come on.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.181
There's nothing that I can do
that you can't.

22:28.307 --> 22:30.100
Hey, are you blind?

22:30.184 --> 22:34.521
Look at you and look at me.
What all I cannot do because of what I am,

22:34.605 --> 22:36.732
and what all you can do
because of what you are!

22:41.653 --> 22:42.654
Lin?

22:58.170 --> 23:00.047
No, you cannot go! Not now!

23:00.130 --> 23:01.840
Where are you going, Mr. Lin?

23:07.054 --> 23:10.599
What's the fucking point, Qasim?
We need real help.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.268
None will be coming.

23:13.352 --> 23:14.770
Have you learned nothing?

23:14.853 --> 23:17.606
Yeah, I learned that blue handprints
make no fucking difference.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.107
I'm sorry. I can't do…

23:21.109 --> 23:22.778
I can't do this.

23:22.861 --> 23:25.697
No, Mr. Lin. It is I who am sorry for you.

23:44.091 --> 23:45.425
Fine quality.

23:47.094 --> 23:49.263
Homemade, Padma ji.

23:49.346 --> 23:53.016
Our lovely Khushi,
who hails from a family of bakers,

23:53.559 --> 23:55.811
prepared this in our kitchen.

23:57.229 --> 23:58.730
Please have another.

23:58.814 --> 24:00.816
I have a figure to maintain.

24:02.568 --> 24:06.446
It is a dream come true
to have someone of your stature…

24:08.073 --> 24:10.284
gift my girls such a future.

24:22.296 --> 24:24.673
And the baker.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.971
The future beckons.

24:35.601 --> 24:39.188
No, no. I don't want to go.

24:39.271 --> 24:40.939
You will do as you're told.

24:41.565 --> 24:44.693
Can you earn more than this? No, right?

24:44.776 --> 24:47.696
Then just do what is asked of you.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.132
Hammad! Hi!

25:09.384 --> 25:10.385
Chan, how are you?

25:11.762 --> 25:13.430
Gonna introduce me to your friends?

25:15.849 --> 25:18.185
-You too.
-Okay, I'll be in touch. Okay.

25:18.268 --> 25:19.269
I'll be back.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.192
Maurizio, right?

25:26.443 --> 25:28.820
You know who I am?
You know who I work for?

25:31.490 --> 25:34.159
Your brown sugar business
stops now, Maurizio.

25:34.910 --> 25:37.329
-I don't know what you're talking about--
-Stop. I know.

25:40.249 --> 25:42.668
Someone doesn't want to see you
get people hurt.

25:43.752 --> 25:46.255
I'm the one
who will get the job of killing you,

25:46.338 --> 25:49.883
and I have a lot on my plate right now.
I can live without the workload.

25:52.261 --> 25:54.221
This is your get-out-of-jail-free card.

25:55.389 --> 25:56.890
Consider it used.

25:57.891 --> 25:59.142
No more business.

26:05.482 --> 26:06.817
Ladies first.

26:06.900 --> 26:07.985
Not for me.

26:09.069 --> 26:10.404
You don't need it.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.241
You're a fucking tiger.

26:14.950 --> 26:16.326
Pretty impressive yourself.

26:19.162 --> 26:20.706
Where are you going?

26:20.789 --> 26:22.124
Home.

26:22.207 --> 26:24.459
No, no, no.

26:27.171 --> 26:29.089
I said I wanted a night with you, eh?

26:33.719 --> 26:35.554
You want me to buy that heroin,

26:37.306 --> 26:41.185
you better do whatever I tell you
for as long as I want it.

26:53.322 --> 26:54.907
You've got till morning.

27:38.283 --> 27:39.535
Yes.

27:58.887 --> 28:00.806
Thank you for seeing me so late.

28:16.989 --> 28:19.074
Last time you were here,

28:19.157 --> 28:23.036
you said that Sagar Wada had its own rules
and that you must abide by them.

28:28.542 --> 28:31.086
Qasim keeps saying we'll get through this,

28:32.129 --> 28:33.589
that they've done it before.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.301
The ones that have died won't.

28:40.095 --> 28:42.556
My neighbors need clean water.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.309
Other medicines too,
but, first and foremost, clean water.

28:46.101 --> 28:48.896
How does Qasimbhai feel
about you coming to me?

28:50.189 --> 28:51.315
He doesn't know.

28:52.733 --> 28:54.568
So, you've already broken the rules.

28:56.528 --> 28:58.530
-I don't have a choice.
-Of course you do.

28:59.615 --> 29:02.951
You could be far away from here.
Why stay when you can leave?

29:08.665 --> 29:11.293
I guess I wanna be the man they see
when they look at me,

29:11.376 --> 29:12.961
not the one I see in the mirror.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.132
I can't do that if I leave them to die.

29:21.011 --> 29:22.471
You know, in ancient times,

29:22.554 --> 29:25.891
the people of this land used to believe
that those who gave water

29:26.767 --> 29:28.977
would achieve
complete satisfaction in life.

29:33.190 --> 29:35.442
Water is life force.

29:36.777 --> 29:39.613
Many Indians wouldn't refuse a man
a glass of water,

29:40.489 --> 29:42.950
even if they were an enemy
or a complete stranger.

29:44.284 --> 29:48.288
Bearing that in mind,
what choice do I have?

29:53.043 --> 29:54.253
So what's in it for you?

29:57.631 --> 30:00.884
We must all find a way
to balance our bad with our good, Lin.

30:02.594 --> 30:04.263
If I have the means to help,

30:04.888 --> 30:07.224
what would that make me
if I didn't use them?

30:10.435 --> 30:13.939
My aid cannot be a secret.

30:14.022 --> 30:15.148
That must be clear.

30:17.025 --> 30:20.028
You are making a deal
on behalf of everyone who lives there,

30:20.112 --> 30:23.282
and everyone must accept that.

30:25.492 --> 30:26.618
Will they?

30:32.875 --> 30:34.710
How long have you been with him?

30:35.294 --> 30:36.879
Your Khaderbhai?

30:40.424 --> 30:41.550
Are you lovers?

30:42.426 --> 30:43.427
No.

30:44.511 --> 30:46.305
He trusts you. That is clear.

30:47.389 --> 30:48.724
Believes you're loyal.

30:48.807 --> 30:49.808
I am.

30:53.228 --> 30:58.233
Loyalty comes out of love or fear or debt.

30:59.151 --> 31:02.321
If you don't love Khaderbhai,
do you fear him or owe him?

31:02.404 --> 31:04.114
What would Padma say about you?

31:08.452 --> 31:13.498
Padma's been with me a long time,
so she'd say all three.

31:15.792 --> 31:20.297
No. No, Padma would give her life for me.

31:21.173 --> 31:23.091
Loyalty has to work both ways.

31:25.802 --> 31:26.803
Does it?

31:33.060 --> 31:34.061
They're here.

31:55.332 --> 31:56.583
That must be the one.

32:00.504 --> 32:03.131
She knows this isn't what she was told.

32:04.299 --> 32:07.261
Look at her, terrified.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.310
Are you so much better than me?

32:17.604 --> 32:21.316
The only difference between us
is that I work for no one.

32:22.317 --> 32:24.152
And certainly no man.

32:30.659 --> 32:32.327
Open up!

32:34.162 --> 32:35.330
Please!

32:36.498 --> 32:37.499
Open up!

32:39.918 --> 32:41.837
Open the door!

32:42.421 --> 32:44.423
I don't want to live here!

32:45.090 --> 32:46.175
Please!

33:11.783 --> 33:12.910
Hey, Linbaba.

33:20.751 --> 33:23.003
And then the best part you missed.

33:27.674 --> 33:29.885
Then suddenly,
the truck hits the side of the jeep,

33:29.968 --> 33:34.556
sending it tumbling down the mountain,
breaking into a million pieces.

33:39.770 --> 33:42.773
And Bachchan Saab is left for dead.

33:44.650 --> 33:51.532
Evil Kaliram decides to celebrate
with drinking and dancing girls.

33:51.615 --> 33:56.662
Budwha leaves for the village
where, unknown to them,

33:57.496 --> 34:03.335
beautiful Phulwa
is tending to Bachchan Saab.

34:03.961 --> 34:07.214
Yes, you guessed it,
Bachchan Saab is not dead.

34:07.297 --> 34:09.382
How can he die, boss?

34:10.967 --> 34:17.056
So, that night, as Kaliram drinks
and the girls dance for him…

34:23.813 --> 34:26.650
who is that handsome man singing

34:28.610 --> 34:32.406
and dancing among them in disguise?

34:44.376 --> 34:47.212
Bachchan Saab, of course.

34:48.380 --> 34:52.426
And that chutiya Kaliram
is too busy drinking to recognize him.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.219
So, Bachchan Saab sings on…

35:39.973 --> 35:40.974
Sebastian.

35:42.643 --> 35:43.644
Sebastian.

35:44.561 --> 35:45.687
Come on. Let's go.

35:57.407 --> 36:01.411
Water! Water! Go, go, go!

36:10.754 --> 36:13.131
You don't need buckets!
It came in bottles! Water!

36:53.839 --> 36:58.886
When I arrived in Bombay,
I had to live on the street.

36:59.720 --> 37:03.515
The very first roof over my head
was that of a tent in the jhopadpatti.

37:03.599 --> 37:06.602
Where you are today, I've been there.

37:08.353 --> 37:12.482
So how can I know of your suffering
and do nothing?

37:15.194 --> 37:17.738
This is our city, Bombay.

37:18.572 --> 37:20.991
It is the hardest city in the world.

37:22.117 --> 37:28.415
And yet we all came here
looking for a better life.

37:29.958 --> 37:30.959
Why?

37:31.960 --> 37:36.006
Because a better life in Bombay
is a life better than anywhere else.

37:37.382 --> 37:39.384
I will help you.

37:39.968 --> 37:43.222
So, if you accept
this token of friendship,

37:43.305 --> 37:45.140
I will help you find yours.

37:45.224 --> 37:49.478
And then, like in all friendships,

37:49.978 --> 37:56.568
there will surely come a day
when I will need you to show up for me.

38:17.464 --> 38:19.383
Hear that?

38:21.552 --> 38:23.595
-Just think!
-Thank you. Thank you.

38:23.679 --> 38:24.930
Where are you going?

38:25.514 --> 38:29.852
His friendship isn't free.

38:35.816 --> 38:38.777
I'd usurped Qasim's authority,
but I didn't care.

38:39.361 --> 38:42.447
I just wanted them to live
to keep my own conscience clear

38:42.531 --> 38:45.033
before I ran again
and left them all behind.

38:49.496 --> 38:51.540
No, no, no. Please. Please. Please.

38:51.623 --> 38:53.750
Please. It is not me you should thank.

38:54.626 --> 38:56.378
This is the gentleman you should thank.

39:02.509 --> 39:03.802
Khaderbhai!

39:04.595 --> 39:06.096
Khaderbhai!

39:47.387 --> 39:49.223
Why did you go to him, Lin?

39:50.140 --> 39:52.726
Why? You know what this means?

39:55.020 --> 39:58.273
People were dying, Qasim. I improvised.

39:59.441 --> 40:02.277
I mean, come on. You've gotta admit,
that's some hefty jugaad.

40:10.077 --> 40:11.870
Now you have won their hearts.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.289
Thanks to Lin.

40:16.291 --> 40:17.835
Yes, thanks to Lin.

40:33.517 --> 40:34.518
Lin!

40:35.978 --> 40:37.396
You didn't listen to me.

40:38.438 --> 40:41.441
I'm telling you,
"Please stay away from gangsters."

40:41.525 --> 40:42.651
And you didn't listen.

40:47.656 --> 40:49.449
-Lin!
-What? What?

40:55.914 --> 40:59.376
Thank you, Linbaba.
Thank you for not listening.

41:04.339 --> 41:06.508
You are a good friend, Linbaba.

41:07.843 --> 41:10.637
A good friend and a good man.

41:13.348 --> 41:16.602
I'm sorry I thought you would leave us.
I should have known better.

41:16.685 --> 41:18.687
Go. Sleep.

41:19.855 --> 41:23.442
I'll wake you in the evening and we can go
get your passport from Didier Sir, okay?

41:25.360 --> 41:28.488
I'm already feeling sadness
about how much I'll miss you.

41:30.032 --> 41:31.200
But it's time, na?

41:32.201 --> 41:33.202
I think so.

41:35.996 --> 41:38.874
That is why you're giving us
this goodbye gift

41:39.625 --> 41:42.586
before these wrong people find you.

41:59.311 --> 42:00.312
Go!

42:48.777 --> 42:52.406
And then Kaliram lunges
at Bachchan Saab with the burning log.

42:55.993 --> 42:57.744
Bachchan Saab kicks him.

42:58.370 --> 43:00.664
The log goes flying!

43:01.874 --> 43:05.794
Kaliram grabs Phulwa
and hurls her at Bachchan Saab…

43:07.004 --> 43:08.463
jumps through the window…

43:13.427 --> 43:15.095
to race to the rope trolley.

43:17.139 --> 43:21.894
But look, Bachchan Saab is
hot on his heels and follows!

43:22.811 --> 43:25.063
He double karate chops Kaliram's cronies…

43:29.735 --> 43:32.654
and leaps through the air,

43:32.738 --> 43:35.115
just about managing
to grab the bottom of the trolley!

43:37.117 --> 43:40.913
Kaliram kicks at his hands…

43:43.707 --> 43:47.753
but Bachchan Saab won't let go. No.

43:47.836 --> 43:48.962
Hey, Bachchan,

43:49.046 --> 43:53.050
do you think she can see
your monkey act from behind the wall?

43:54.343 --> 43:57.763
Come inside
and show your fighting shmiting. Come.

44:09.650 --> 44:12.903
Don't just stand there.
You're blocking all the air.

44:13.487 --> 44:14.488
Come in.
