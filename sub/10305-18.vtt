00:02.520 --> 00:04.317
You know, Al...

00:04.520 --> 00:07.193
<i>...I think I wanna get a TV
in the bedroom.</i>

00:07.880 --> 00:10.997
Good idea, Peg. Then we'll instal
a fridge in the nightstand...

00:11.200 --> 00:13.191
...and you won't need legs at all.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.951
You know, if body parts fell off
because of lack of use...

00:18.160 --> 00:20.594
...you'd be a Ken doll.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.159
Kelly...

00:25.840 --> 00:27.876
What? I don't know what
you're so upset about.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.071
It was a perfectly good role.

00:34.960 --> 00:39.397
Oh, yeah. The kind
you can really sink your teeth into.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.397
You gotta be willing to pay your dues.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.718
I am, but I can't be
a cheese hostess forever, Bud.

00:46.120 --> 00:49.237
Of course you can't.
You have an expiration date.

00:52.520 --> 00:57.548
Look at me. My career's a joke.
Come on, help me out of this thing.

00:57.760 --> 01:02.390
- All right, pumpkin, we'll help you.
- Oh, it's okay, we love you.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.835
We'd like you more with crackers.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.629
You know, Bud, next time
she gets a job like this...

01:11.840 --> 01:13.796
...maybe it could be as a bonbon girl.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.350
There won't be a next time...

01:16.560 --> 01:20.678
...because another agent has called me
from the Almost Artists Agency.

01:21.320 --> 01:24.756
That would be a big mistake, Kel.
They'll treat you like a piece of meat.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.390
Hear that, Peg?
We're gonna get meat.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.550
Fine. Then you have one week
to get me a decent job.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.239
And that means nothing edible.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.668
Kel, what's the big deal?

01:35.880 --> 01:38.713
I mean, you've been playing
a vegetable all your life.

01:39.560 --> 01:44.111
Oh, now, young lady, young lady.
We're not finished with you yet.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.788
- Yeah, honey.
- Would you two stop?

01:47.000 --> 01:50.959
Now, go stand someplace cold.
I may want a sandwich after a while.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

02:53.560 --> 02:56.677
Al, you been working out?

03:01.680 --> 03:04.353
Al, I'm lonely.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.233
Wait a minute, Peg. Wait a minute.

03:07.880 --> 03:11.475
Get up! Wake up, wake up, wake up!.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.468
<i>- I just got a big part on a TV show.
- Oh, hey...</i>

03:15.680 --> 03:18.069
Honey, that's great,
but it's midnight, you know...

03:18.280 --> 03:20.157
...and your father and I
want our privacy.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.557
Hey, now, wait a minute, Peg.
The kids are trying to share.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.399
You can't just phone
that parent stuff in.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.558
Listen, Kelly's filling in
for the Princess of Puppet Land...

03:29.760 --> 03:31.990
<i>- ... on Uncle Dudley's Playpen.
- Hey...</i>

03:32.200 --> 03:35.590
Oh, Kelly,
that was your favourite show.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.076
<i>You know, when you were little,
I used to put you in front of that TV...</i>

03:39.280 --> 03:42.397
...and Uncle Dudley would entertain
you when I went out shopping...

03:42.600 --> 03:46.593
...or to the movies,
or went away for the weekend.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.836
He was my favourite babysitter.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.634
He never told when
I used to put worms in Bud's ears.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.799
What?

03:54.960 --> 03:58.953
My pumpkin is becoming a princess.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.596
Gee, if I could only trade my cow
for some magic beans.

04:03.360 --> 04:06.670
Al, the last thing
you need are beans.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.075
- Come on, Bud, let's go.
- What?

04:09.280 --> 04:12.397
<i>So listen. If Kelly's gonna be
on Uncle Dudley's Playpen...</i>

04:12.600 --> 04:14.989
<i>...I definitely
need a TV in the bedroom.</i>

04:15.200 --> 04:17.668
But, Peg,
that show comes on at 10 a. m.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.394
Can't you drag your butt
to the living room before that?

04:20.600 --> 04:23.478
- I know it's a tough commute, Peg.
- Al.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.955
You're gonna start nagging
about this, aren't you?

04:26.160 --> 04:30.358
- I do not nag!
- All right, Peg, all right.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.348
<i>You can have a TV in the bedroom.
I mean, that thing I can mute.</i>

04:36.360 --> 04:38.828
But I'm gonna want
something myself, Peg.

04:40.560 --> 04:44.155
Sure, tiger. Surprise me.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.795
Okay, everybody,
we're back in five...

04:55.000 --> 04:57.798
...four, three, two, one.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.357
Okay, kids.
Ready for our Manners Minute.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.710
Excuse me.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.315
What for, Fredrick?

05:08.760 --> 05:09.988
For that?

05:12.400 --> 05:17.758
You know, that little Fredrick
is almost as talented as Uncle Dudley.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.758
Yeah, yeah. He's good enough
to go out on his own.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.234
Oh, yeah.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.869
And we'll be right back.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.036
Come on.
I'll introduce you to Uncle Dudley.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.038
Kelly?
Please, please don't embarrass me.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.198
Bud, I know
how to behave on a set.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.833
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, my God!

05:35.040 --> 05:38.589
I can't believe it's really you!
You look just like yourself, only older.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.189
I've been watching you for years.
I love you so much.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.392
And we're back in five, four...

05:44.600 --> 05:45.874
Welcome back, kids.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.674
Now, we all remember
that Princess Babs...

05:48.880 --> 05:52.509
...is away having elective surgery.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.269
So let's give a great,
big happy hello...

05:56.480 --> 06:01.315
...to substitute, Princess Kelly.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.875
Hi, goys and birls.

06:08.880 --> 06:12.475
That's a good one, Krincess Pelly.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.834
Thanks, Duncle Udley.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.751
That's the joke, don't wear it out.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.150
Today's Puppet Land story...

06:25.360 --> 06:29.353
...is " Curious George
Converts to Judaism. "

06:31.640 --> 06:34.677
" Curious George
was crossing Delancey...

06:34.880 --> 06:39.158
...when the wind
blew off his yarmulke into the gutter. "

06:40.120 --> 06:43.874
Did it land
next to Uncle Dudley's career?

06:44.080 --> 06:46.116
Shut up, you dummy.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.719
Make me, tubbo.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.599
Why, you rotten piece of driftwood.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.712
Oh, you talentless burnout.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.508
Kids. Kids. Kids?

07:12.720 --> 07:17.919
Now, Uncle Dudley and Fredrick,
they're really best friends...

07:18.120 --> 07:21.510
...and sometimes friends say things
to each other that they don't mean...

07:21.720 --> 07:23.199
...and they lose their heads.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.835
No, no.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.598
I'm fine, kids. Just a scratch.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.077
Where's Uncle Dudley?

07:34.280 --> 07:36.748
Well, he's gone to rest...

07:36.960 --> 07:40.236
...in the Sleepytime Kingdom.

07:40.440 --> 07:44.672
It's a big castle with soft walls...

07:44.880 --> 07:48.634
...and magic potions that are gonna
make him feel all better, okay?

07:48.840 --> 07:51.149
So say goodbye, Fredrick.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.713
Goodbye, Fredrick.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.789
Clear.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.428
Kelly, you were brilliant.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.312
- I was?
- Yeah, she was?

08:02.520 --> 08:04.715
I mean, she was.

08:04.920 --> 08:08.196
That's why Kelly Bundy should host
the show until Uncle Dudley recovers.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.277
- Great idea. You're hired.
- I am?

08:10.480 --> 08:12.755
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Bud, I'm a star!

08:12.960 --> 08:16.236
- You're a star. You're a star.
- I'm a star. I'm a star!

08:24.200 --> 08:26.350
Good night, pookie.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.593
Al, I don't like these twin beds.
It's unnatural.

08:31.800 --> 08:35.076
Anything involving you
and a bed is unnatural, Peg.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.238
Just put on your snore strap
and go to sleep.

08:40.039 --> 08:41.792
Al Bundy,
you're gonna pay for this.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.638
Peg, we made a deal.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.308
<i>You have your TV,
which will help you get to sleep...</i>

08:46.520 --> 08:49.830
...and I don't have you,
which will help me get to sleep.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.998
Nighty-night.

09:49.520 --> 09:53.069
Peg, wake up. Peg, wake-

09:53.880 --> 09:55.393
This ought to jump-start her.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.670
<i>Attention, home shoppers.</i>

09:57.880 --> 10:02.078
<i>Call now for this fabulous
Fabio shower massager.</i>

10:07.720 --> 10:09.153
You know, Al...

10:09.360 --> 10:12.033
...this kind of reminds me
of how we were in high school...

10:12.240 --> 10:15.596
...and you used to sneak into my room
late at night.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.916
I never snuck in your room
in high school.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.471
I think Kelly's show is on.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.274
<i>Oh, Bobby Beaver.</i>

10:30.200 --> 10:32.509
<i>Won't you ever learn?</i>

10:34.160 --> 10:36.993
Oh, you know,
she is really good with kids.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.749
- She got that from me, you know.
- Oh, yeah, right, Peg.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.919
After this commercial, she's gonna
feed them diet pills for breakfast.

10:45.560 --> 10:50.395
You know, those diet pills saved us
a fortune in school lunches.

10:50.600 --> 10:54.718
<i>Kids, did you know
that Princess Kelly has a little brother?</i>

10:54.920 --> 10:56.717
Well, he's here with us today.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.279
Boys and girls,
I'd like you to meet Budrick.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.796
<i>Hi, kids, I'm Budrick.</i>

11:15.200 --> 11:19.318
Isn't that sweet of Kelly?
She has Bud on the show.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.792
Seems a little stiff though, huh, Peg?

11:23.440 --> 11:27.513
Well, you know,
Kelly is the talented one.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.436
Budrick is the saddest little boy
in Puppet Land.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.712
None of the girl puppets
will play with him...

11:36.200 --> 11:38.316
...so he has to play with himself.

11:43.360 --> 11:49.879
So remember, kids,
don't be a Budrick, be a Goodrick.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.678
Clear.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.590
Kelly, don't you think
you should've cleared...

11:58.800 --> 12:01.951
- ... the Budrick puppet with me first?
- Bud, I am the star of the show.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.151
I don't have to clear anything
with anybody.

12:04.360 --> 12:08.194
Kelly, why did you cut
my giant cupcake sketch?

12:08.400 --> 12:10.550
I don't know,
I thought it was kind of childish.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.557
I am a child.

12:14.760 --> 12:18.833
Do you believe that?
That beaver is such a diva.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.313
Kelly, you can't just go cutting out
the other characters.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.873
You're gonna ruin the show.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.957
You saved the show.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.594
The ratings are holding steady
ages two to 11...

12:28.800 --> 12:32.952
...and they're through the roof
with men 18 to 99.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.114
Whatever you want, you got it.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.392
Did you hear that, Bud?
Anything I want.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.555
Oh, which reminds me.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.672
I was kind of thinking about
changing the title of the show.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.792
<i>How about Princess Kelly's Castle?</i>

12:47.440 --> 12:50.318
Where the drawbridge never closes.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.716
Watch it, Bud. I don't need
to take that from my assistant.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.148
I'm your agent.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.999
If you need a new agent,
I can make some calls.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.317
Find out who represents
the 101 Dalmatians.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.033
I mean, they're everywhere.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.513
It's the same old story, huh?

13:09.720 --> 13:12.712
I make you a star, and suddenly
you start treating me like dirt.

13:12.920 --> 13:16.708
That's not true.
I've always treated you like dirt.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.036
You won't get away with it.
We have a contract.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.912
You can't prove that's my "X."

13:21.120 --> 13:22.997
- Security.
- What?

13:23.200 --> 13:25.953
Wait a second. Hey, now. Hey-

13:27.720 --> 13:32.475
Excuse me. Who put
Captain Bananas in a pink tutu?

13:32.680 --> 13:34.432
Think, people. He's a male.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.198
He needs a blue tutu.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.709
What, am I working alone here?
Come on, let's go.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.272
You shouldn't have slept
on top of me, Peg.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.635
My spine is cracking
like a plumber's ass.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.437
Don't be silly, Al.
You don't have a spine.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.791
Your daughter is a rotten,
ungrateful witch.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.116
No, that's your mother, Bud.

14:06.080 --> 14:09.356
Your sister is a princess,
and don't you forget it.

14:09.560 --> 14:10.993
She fired me.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.351
Honey, that's because
Kelly is a star now...

14:14.560 --> 14:19.031
...and you don't represent stars.
You represent cheese.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.431
Dad, Kelly humiliated me
on the air with that puppet.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.279
Yes, I know.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.996
And that was wrong, son,
but it's only a puppet.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.191
The whole thing
is probably forgotten by now.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.595
Yeah. They were selling these
on the way home.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.752
Is that an extra large?

14:41.440 --> 14:45.228
All right, son. So you tried your best
and you failed miserably.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.032
You're a Bundy.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.510
But I fully expect you
to kick this curse.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.751
I have faith in you.

14:51.960 --> 14:55.475
You're right, Dad. I'm not gonna end up
some middle-aged shoe salesman...

14:55.680 --> 14:57.591
- ... making minimum wage.
- Okay, Bud.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.995
Slaving away 20 years,
never getting a promotion.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.792
All right, Bud.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.755
No respect, no raises,
no reason to live, no hair.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.674
- This father-son talk is over.
- Yeah, it's a good talk, Dad.

15:11.880 --> 15:15.839
I'm gonna go out, and I'm gonna sign
the biggest star I can find.

15:17.040 --> 15:21.909
Good luck, Budrick.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.072
What do you wanna
represent me for? I'm a failure.

15:26.640 --> 15:30.952
A failure? Aren't you the same guy
who taught every kid in Chicago...

15:31.160 --> 15:33.037
...how to make a hat
out of a milk carton?

15:33.240 --> 15:34.389
You saw that?

15:34.600 --> 15:37.751
Why, sure. I mean, we didn't have milk
so I used a cigarette carton...

15:37.960 --> 15:39.598
...but it was still fun.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.113
No, no, no. No, I can't go back.

15:43.320 --> 15:46.869
I frightened all the children,
and they can never forgive me.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.433
That's not true.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.916
As Freddy Frog always says,
" Frog-give and frog-get. "

15:52.720 --> 15:56.315
- How's Freddy doing, anyway?
- Princess Kelly fired him.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.669
Oh, my God.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.838
How will he support Frieda
and the tadpoles?

16:01.680 --> 16:04.717
You see? You have to go back
and save Puppet Land.

16:04.920 --> 16:05.955
You're right.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.437
But what about
that nice Princess Kelly?

16:09.640 --> 16:11.596
She's about to get a royal flush.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.719
You know, Al...

16:19.920 --> 16:24.596
...when I said I wanted you on top
of me, this is not what I had in mind.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.394
You're never satisfied,
are you, Peg?

16:28.800 --> 16:33.874
Oh, yeah, I'm satisfied sometimes.
You're just never around to see it.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.918
You know, Peg,
these bunk beds are comfy.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.470
That's nice, honey.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.240
Let me rock you to sleep.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.110
You know, you were right, Al.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.039
Bunk beds are fun.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.270
What are you, a fool?

16:59.480 --> 17:01.914
Well, yeah.

17:02.120 --> 17:07.797
I said I wanted
only purple M&M's. Purple, royal.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.353
But they don't make
purple M&M's, Kelly.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.916
- Kelly?
- Your Highness.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.874
You know, Uncle Dudley
was always nice to the fools.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.194
I am nice.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.396
If I was a prince,
I'd be a perfectionist...

17:23.599 --> 17:25.477
...but because
I'm a princess, I'm a bitch.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.390
We're back in five, four, three...

17:37.000 --> 17:40.037
<i>Welcome back
to Princess Kelly's Castle.</i>

17:40.240 --> 17:44.074
Oh, look, I think it's time
for the royal milk and cookies.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.909
Here comes our old friend,
Bobby Beaver.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.751
Yummy.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.559
Hi, Princess Kelly.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.830
Fredrick, what are you doing here?

18:09.080 --> 18:10.672
I invited him.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.309
Excuse me, Uncle Doodey,
but I'm trying to do my show.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.478
That's Uncle Dudley,
and it's our show.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.875
But we'd love to share it with you.

18:25.280 --> 18:29.751
Kids, sharing is for losers.
This is my show now.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.075
Hey, what are you doing that for?
What are you booing me for?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.271
He's the one
who just went to the funny farm.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.550
Princess Kelly, that wasn't very nice.

18:38.760 --> 18:42.070
I am too nice, you ************!

18:42.840 --> 18:46.150
There was nothing happy
about that thought.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.510
Hey, what are you-?
Why are you taking me away?

18:48.720 --> 18:52.190
- He's crazy. I'm not crazy.
- Come on, Freddy, let's get her.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.038
Stop biting me!

18:54.400 --> 18:57.517
See you tomorrow, boys and girls.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.553
And we're out.

19:04.760 --> 19:07.797
Uncle Dudley,
thank God you're back.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.639
Starting tomorrow,
everything's back the way it was.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.353
Not so fast.

19:12.560 --> 19:16.109
My client is entertaining several offers,
and we'll get back to you.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.311
Wait, whatever they're paying,
we'll double.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.431
That sounds like a happy thought.

19:20.680 --> 19:21.954
<i>And here's another one:</i>

19:22.160 --> 19:24.913
Budrick, you're fired.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.633
<i>Don't go away, we'll be right back.</i>

19:39.600 --> 19:42.956
Is it time for my pain medicine yet?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.912
Quiet, Al,
I'm trying to watch Uncle Dudley.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.680
<i>Thanks, kids. It's great being back.</i>

19:53.880 --> 19:59.637
<i>And I owe it all to Bud Bundy,
the best agent in Chicago.</i>

19:59.840 --> 20:03.276
I can't believe
they picked Uncle Doodey over me.

20:03.480 --> 20:07.758
Well, in Uncle Dudley's defence,
they can pay him in cheap gin.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.949
Darn you, Bud.
You ruined my career.

20:11.160 --> 20:15.836
Oh, now, now, young lady.
Bud represents stars.

20:16.040 --> 20:19.476
You're just an expired cheese.

20:20.400 --> 20:24.029
<i>Yeah, someday the girl
will get married, the boy will move out.</i>

20:24.240 --> 20:28.358
<i>Peg won't be able to mak e it up
the stairs if I loosen a few floorboards.</i>

20:29.000 --> 20:32.515
<i>And I'll have my bed all to myself.</i>

20:32.720 --> 20:34.836
Someday, I'll be that lucky.
