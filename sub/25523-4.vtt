Joaquin has run out of luck.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.290
That he's been hiding for the
last few months

01:22.373 --> 01:23.708

I want you to take a message

But business-wise,
his absence is barely noticeable.

I don't want you to go, Joaquin.

can't defend that turf?

18:46.500 --> 18:47.751
No. I have to lead them.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.294
The organization needs me.

18:52.005 --> 18:53.549
[steps approaching]

19:01.098 --> 19:01.932
Victor.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.686
Give me a minute, please.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.313
Go away now, ma'am.
My husband won't talk to you.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.439
Ma'am, please.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.817
If the secretary had known
about his termination,

19:11.942 --> 19:13.777
he wouldn't have allowed it.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.822
He's very thankful to people
like your husband.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.783
It's not fair you have to endure hardship

19:19.867 --> 19:21.743
after what your husband did for Mexico.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.121
He's very stubborn. He won't see you.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.498
If he changes his mind, please...

19:28.125 --> 19:29.418
...give me a call.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.547
And tell your husband I'm stubborn, too.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.008
I'll insist until he sees me.

19:36.925 --> 19:37.843
Goodbye.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.478
[engineer] Here's Felix Olivares'
school record, as you requested.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.773
So, according to this...

19:53.317 --> 19:55.986
He only made it to sixth semester
of law school.

20:26.642 --> 20:27.976
Go to the bar association.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.854
Check if this is a valid ID number.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.448
[Bravo] Sir.

20:42.824 --> 20:43.909
The governor is here.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.521
[Chapo] Hello, Jorge, how are you?

21:13.021 --> 21:14.022
I'm fine, Joaquin.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.857
JORGE DEL TORO,
GOVERNOR OF SINALOA

21:19.945 --> 21:22.281
[Jorge]
When are you planning to move to Mochis?

21:22.781 --> 21:23.865
As soon as possible.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.325
How many men are coming with you?

21:25.534 --> 21:28.412
About 20 men will go with me,
and 30 more are coming later.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.248
That are is invaded by the Navy.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.583
And there are military checkpoints
on the roads.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.587
What you request can be done,
but it's going to be expensive.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.673
Has it ever been cheap, Jorge?

21:41.425 --> 21:42.259
Done.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.679
I'll coordinate the best moment
for your departure.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.015
You have to avoid Guasave.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.517
Some will be led out by land,
others by air.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.158
[driver]
What's up with those army guys?

22:48.867 --> 22:50.577
We have an arrangement with them.

22:51.036 --> 22:54.081
This is where we split in two.
You'll follow me to the airplane.

22:54.372 --> 22:55.749
[police officer]
That's five more kilometers.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.793
The runway is on the right side.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.796
[Bravo] Marcelo is waiting
for us in Los Mochis.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.132
He already sent reports
on Isidoro's recent moves.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.678
[Bravo] The shoot out has started.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.933
[engines revving]

23:28.990 --> 23:29.825
I see.

23:30.700 --> 23:31.910
Thank you. Goodbye.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.251
You didn't get the job?

23:44.422 --> 23:46.967
At least listen to her,
and see what she has to say.

23:57.435 --> 23:58.270
Thank you.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.440
[Berta] The secretary
wanted to come in person

24:02.524 --> 24:05.443
but he was unable due to the
unfair investigation on him.

24:06.194 --> 24:07.988
Very few politicians understand

24:08.071 --> 24:10.157
that the only way to finish
drug trafficking

24:10.240 --> 24:11.741
is by dividing it internally.

24:12.075 --> 24:13.952
But you do understand, right, Victor?

24:15.453 --> 24:16.621
The secretary does, too.

24:17.372 --> 24:20.375
That is why he makes a few hard,
unpopular decisions,

24:20.458 --> 24:21.918
like the one affecting you.

24:22.794 --> 24:23.628
What do you want?

24:24.004 --> 24:26.173
If you declare you fought
with the Sinaloa cartel

24:26.256 --> 24:29.467
when the investigating commission comes,

24:29.634 --> 24:33.305
you will set back the secretary's
years of work fighting drug traffic.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.432
I'll just tell the truth.

24:35.974 --> 24:36.808
Besides,

24:36.892 --> 24:40.437
the commission are the only ones that have
taken any interest in me for years.

24:41.605 --> 24:45.150
If the commission were interested,
they would have offered specific help.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.944
[Berta] Did they offer a prosthetic leg?

24:50.155 --> 24:51.198
A pension?

24:53.700 --> 24:55.702
That's what I'm here to offer, Victor.

24:56.912 --> 25:00.707
Allow the secretary to repay you some
of the damage he unknowingly inflicted.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.920
A prosthesis could help you earn money
for your family again.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.423
And a pension would give them
financial security for life.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.361
[gunman] All right, the boss is here.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.321
ENTRANCE TO LOS MOCHIS,
SINALOA MEXICO

25:36.201 --> 25:38.119
[man] This is as far as I can go, sir.

25:38.578 --> 25:40.956
From this moment on,
you're in Marcelo's hands.

25:41.456 --> 25:43.416
Give thanks to the governor on my behalf.

25:43.541 --> 25:44.668
With pleasure, sir.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.297
What's up, fellas?

25:50.757 --> 25:52.592
Are we going to fuck up Isidoro, or what?

25:52.801 --> 25:54.177
Hell yes, sir!

25:55.637 --> 25:56.930
[man on the radio]
The road is clear.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.391
Move! Get in the trucks!

26:12.028 --> 26:14.239
Where is that motherfucker, Marcelo?

26:14.364 --> 26:16.491
By Las Calaveras, near the Devil's curve.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.243
He wants to snatch
the best entry into the city.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.411
MARCELO
TURF BOSS

26:19.494 --> 26:20.412
How well armed is he?

26:20.495 --> 26:22.247
There's a lot of them and they're heavy.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.332
They've killed six men so far,
and injured several.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.668
Well, now that we're here, they're fucked.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.838
Come on. Let's go! Go!

26:38.722 --> 26:40.640
[machine gun shooting]

26:41.266 --> 26:43.351
There they are.
Right at the devil's curve.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.187
Is there any way we can take
a back entrance?

26:46.396 --> 26:47.439
There is no road.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.607
There is a hill on the side.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.776
We'd be an easy target on the hill.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.570
Let's go with our people.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.824
I am going to kill that bastard.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.243
[gunshots and screams]

27:25.977 --> 27:27.395
[Bravo]
Cover me, cover me!

27:27.771 --> 27:29.314
[bullets clinking]

27:39.574 --> 27:42.452
I thought you didn't have
the balls to show up, Chapo!

27:42.535 --> 27:45.080
I'm going to fuck you up, just like I
fucked your boss, El Arriero, bastard!

27:45.538 --> 27:49.751
You fucked them like you fuck everyone,
you fucking traitor!

27:57.967 --> 28:01.137
Now we're fucked up for real,
go, go!

28:01.221 --> 28:03.348
Let's go! To the entrance!

28:05.058 --> 28:05.892
Shoot, you bastard!

28:08.395 --> 28:10.313
Let's go to the hill!

28:13.316 --> 28:14.192
They're coming!

28:27.038 --> 28:28.164
Don't step back!

28:33.294 --> 28:35.630
Kill them! Kill them!

28:36.464 --> 28:38.842
[gunman]
There you go, faggots!

28:46.891 --> 28:49.144
-[ears buzzing]
-[muffled screams in the background]

28:57.402 --> 28:59.404
[gunshots]

29:03.575 --> 29:04.909
They keep advancing.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.662
This is gonna be difficult to control.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.164
Let me call for backup.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.832
[growling]

29:13.126 --> 29:14.961
Come with me, sir.
You need to take cover.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.463
I'm needed here.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.633
[gunshots]

29:28.975 --> 29:30.393
[whimpering]

30:02.342 --> 30:04.344
[coughing]

30:12.602 --> 30:14.604
[gunshots]

30:16.648 --> 30:18.650
[engine starting]

30:35.333 --> 30:36.709
[tires screeching]

30:40.547 --> 30:41.589
[coughing]

30:57.438 --> 30:58.439
[crash]

31:10.535 --> 31:11.536
[car stops]

31:21.796 --> 31:22.630
[door closing]

31:28.136 --> 31:29.137
[grunts]

31:38.730 --> 31:40.440
[cocking gun]

31:40.565 --> 31:41.399
It's me!

31:42.734 --> 31:43.568
It's me, sir.

31:50.366 --> 31:51.326
[moans]

31:59.542 --> 32:00.919
[man] Let's go drink!

32:07.759 --> 32:10.637
[gunman] We fucked him up, sir.
We kept the turf.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.221
[gunman 2]
We missed you, sir,

32:12.722 --> 32:14.682
but Marcelo here, managed things well.

32:15.308 --> 32:18.019
[Marcelo] Isidoro escaped,
but we kept the turf.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.938
Los Mochis is still ours.

32:20.647 --> 32:21.606
Well done, Marcelo.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.901
The battle won't wait on anyone,
not even for me.

32:58.351 --> 33:01.020
First of all, we want to thank you,
for receiving us.

33:01.187 --> 33:02.438
INVESTIGATING COMMISSION

33:02.522 --> 33:04.941
Your statement could be
fundamental to prove...

33:05.316 --> 33:07.986
the alleged connections of the
secretary of public safety

33:08.069 --> 33:09.153
with drug lords.

33:11.197 --> 33:12.031
We're listening.

33:18.705 --> 33:21.290
[wife] Tell the gentlemen
what you have to tell them.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.462
This interview was conducted
at a bad time.

33:28.297 --> 33:30.842
They had terminated my contract
and I was very angry.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.468
One year had passed.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.805
I almost lost my life
fighting drug trafficking.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.141
And they had forgotten about me.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.601
That's why I said those things.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.311
To put my case in the spotlight.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.064
Everything I said during that interview,
is a lie.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.525
I never fought alongside
the Sinaloa cartel.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.487
I always fought them and all the cartels.

34:10.173 --> 34:12.508
[journalist]
After the commission's report

34:12.717 --> 34:15.219
your name was cleared
from the rumors connecting you

34:15.303 --> 34:16.679
to the Sinaloa cartel.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.265
What is your opinion
of this investigation?

34:20.808 --> 34:23.728
The fact that a commission was assembled
to investigate me,

34:24.020 --> 34:27.815
is just another proof of the good health
of Mexican democracy

34:28.608 --> 34:31.277
and the rule of law in our country.

34:32.820 --> 34:34.280
All I am expecting of course,

34:34.363 --> 34:35.490
JOURNALIST
GLOBAL NEWS

34:35.656 --> 34:40.578
is a retraction from your colleague,
Omar Pardo.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.540
[Sol] I hope you never
doubted me, Esteban.

34:46.292 --> 34:47.460
Of course I didn't.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.593
This might interest you, too.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.350
I believe someone was trying to
divert the attention.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.478
We must watch out
for all the little details.

35:06.646 --> 35:07.605
What's this number?

35:09.440 --> 35:11.609
It's Felix Olivares' professional license.

35:12.985 --> 35:14.987
His law degree is phony.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.580
Are you ready to be
my secretary of state?

35:27.333 --> 35:28.584
It will be my pleasure.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.018
Do you want a whiskey?

35:46.644 --> 35:47.478
Please.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.636
[Chapo]
Thanks for everything, Jorge.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.847
And thanks for lending me your ranch.

36:23.014 --> 36:23.931
It's fucking great.

36:24.223 --> 36:26.017
You're going to be comfortable here.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.811
Well, my home is your home.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.440
Thanks.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.650
[Chapo]
Has the missus arrived?

36:34.901 --> 36:36.736
[guard]
Yes, sir. She's in the back.

36:45.703 --> 36:46.704
What's up, my queen?

36:48.206 --> 36:49.498
How's the baby boy doing?

36:51.250 --> 36:52.126
Baby girls.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.258
It's two girls, twins.

37:03.971 --> 37:05.598
I would have loved to be there.

37:06.682 --> 37:09.185
I thought you'd wait for me
to go to the ultrasound.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.354
I thought I wasn't going to see you again.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.189
But here I am, safe and sound.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.733
How are we going to name them?

37:16.651 --> 37:18.277
I've already picked their names.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.281
What's the matter, Elba?

37:22.907 --> 37:23.824
I have no choice.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.953
What's going to happen
if you get killed or extradited?

37:27.411 --> 37:29.997
I will have to make
every decision myself for our daughters.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.415
That's not going to happen.

37:31.499 --> 37:32.917
You have no way to know that.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.337
If the gringos extradited Mayel,
they can also extradite you.

37:37.838 --> 37:40.675
I don't want that to happen, Joaquin,
but you're risking it.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.679
We need you, but if you're
not here any more...

37:45.012 --> 37:46.639
we'll go on without you.

38:04.907 --> 38:07.076
