07:46.507 --> 07:47.842
{\an3}Like what?

07:47.925 --> 07:49.385
I mean, we just tend
to, like, fall back

07:49.468 --> 07:52.597
{\an1}into our old ways
every time we see each other.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.891
{\an4}In high school,
like, he was, like,
my first boyfriend.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.017
{\an6}Oh, really?

07:54.974 --> 07:56.017
{\an1}Yeah.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.560
{\an5}I didn't know that.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.560
{\an1}Yeah!

07:57.643 --> 08:00.021
{\an4}And he's the only one
who really knows me
from that time.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.064
{\an1}I'm totally fine,
like, us just being friends.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.483
{\an1}And, like, it goes great,
but then as soon as I, like,

08:04.567 --> 08:06.444
{\an1}see him
with someone else...

08:06.527 --> 08:08.613
Yeah, like Juliette.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.072
{\an1}Yeah.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.657

like...

08:11.741 --> 08:13.534
you guys being together?

08:13.618 --> 08:16.579
The guy cannot, like,
be with just one girl.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.747
{\an1}Like...
(laughs)

08:17.830 --> 08:19.624
{\an1}Never ends well,
but...

08:19.707 --> 08:21.751
{\an1}Every time I see him,
it's like...

08:21.834 --> 08:24.587
{\an1}He pulls out the charm,
and so...

08:24.670 --> 08:26.088
That's annoying.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.675
{\an1}So you don't have
any boy drama, I guess,

are just like pretty steady.

08:31.928 --> 08:32.970

08:33.054 --> 08:34.764
{\an4}Ohh.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.764
He's a sweetie.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.557
{\an4}So you met him when
you moved down?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.557
{\an3}Yeah.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.601
{\an1}So he's probably trying
to figure everyone out, too?

08:38.683 --> 08:41.562

and sits their friend down

21:51.852 --> 21:53.437
{\an1}and says, "Listen, you need
to take a step back

21:53.520 --> 21:56.231
{\an1}whether you were
in the right or the wrong."

21:56.314 --> 21:57.566
I mean, at this point,
it really doesn't matter.

21:57.649 --> 22:01.236
No, I know my mouth
is definitely, like,

22:01.319 --> 22:02.654
what started this all,

22:02.738 --> 22:05.032
but I also feel like

22:05.115 --> 22:06.950
{\an1}there was no need for her
to take it

22:07.034 --> 22:09.077
to the extent that she did.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.912
So you think you have
a mouth on you

22:10.996 --> 22:13.248
and you don't have
an anger problem?

22:13.331 --> 22:14.458
I don't know what I have.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.000

I'm not a therapist--

22:15.083 --> 22:16.168
I'm not a therapist,

22:16.251 --> 22:20.714

you should see one.

22:20.797 --> 22:22.966

happening before.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.343

the temper problem, Chloe.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.095

22:27.179 --> 22:29.264
and you don't like anybody
stepping on your territory.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.266
{\an1}You're acting
like there's a reason

22:31.349 --> 22:34.936
{\an1}that I deserved her
to punch me.

22:35.020 --> 22:35.979
{\an5}Totally turning it on me--

22:35.020 --> 22:35.979
No, it sounds like--

22:36.063 --> 22:38.190
{\an5}--like it was all my--

22:36.063 --> 22:38.190
I don't care about her.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.608
{\an1}It sounds like--
I really don't care about her.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.276

22:47.657 --> 22:51.453
{\an1}You know, I've been through
a lot of problems with the law.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.121
You know, when I was younger,

22:53.205 --> 22:55.040
I went and did
some time in juvie

22:55.123 --> 22:57.084
{\an5}for possession of marijuana--

22:55.123 --> 22:57.084
{\an1}Yeah.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.127
{\an1}--and when you're in juvie,
all you're thinking about

22:59.211 --> 23:01.004
is, "I'm missing this time
with my mom,

23:01.088 --> 23:03.131
I'm missing this time with
my dad, my grandmother."

23:03.215 --> 23:05.634
{\an1}It was the worst experience
of my life.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.302
Sometimes I'd
cry myself to sleep,

23:07.385 --> 23:11.306
{\an1}and in those moments, I could
see I had hit rock bottom,

23:11.389 --> 23:12.849
and the only way
I was gonna redeem myself

23:12.933 --> 23:15.936
was to take responsibility
for my actions.

23:16.019 --> 23:17.395
And I'm gonna tell you this.

23:17.479 --> 23:20.232
{\an1}After losing so much,
it's just like, "I give up."

23:20.315 --> 23:22.567
And I can see
you're at that point.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.151
Just throw your hands up
and be like,

23:23.235 --> 23:24.444
"I'm done with all this.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.446
This is just not
how I want to live."

31:04.445 --> 31:05.780

31:05.863 --> 31:08.408
{\an1}Dude, well, Chloe just found out
that Amanda's going,

31:08.491 --> 31:09.701
which I thought she knew.

31:09.784 --> 31:12.370
{\an1}So, what, she's not gonna come
to the party now?

31:12.453 --> 31:14.455
Apparently not.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.331
Everything was going fine

31:15.415 --> 31:17.125
and we were just
chatting, whatnot,

31:17.208 --> 31:19.711
and then next thing, she
was just, "I'm not going.

31:19.794 --> 31:22.547
"I'm gonna be immature
about this

31:22.630 --> 31:24.215
and it's stupid
for me to go."

31:24.299 --> 31:25.133
And then
she slams the door

31:25.216 --> 31:28.303
and I'm just like,
"Really? Like..."

31:28.386 --> 31:30.305
Once she gets on that rampage,

31:30.388 --> 31:31.806
{\an1}it's like
trying to tame a tiger.

31:31.889 --> 31:33.725
And then it's
everyone else's fault.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.810
Everyone else's fault, she's
the victim, she's the martyr.

31:35.893 --> 31:38.605
{\an1}I had a one-on-one
with her the other day

31:38.688 --> 31:41.232
{\an1}and I thought that we had
finally come

31:41.316 --> 31:42.358
{\an1}to a consensus
that she needed help

31:42.442 --> 31:46.321
{\an1}and she wanted to change
and she knew she had a problem

31:46.404 --> 31:47.989
{\an1}and it got emotional,
and I thought

31:48.072 --> 31:49.616
{\an1}that maybe I had
broken through the barrier.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.993
Let's call her up

31:52.076 --> 31:54.329
{\an1}and let's try to convince her
to come to the party.

31:54.412 --> 31:58.166
Um... all right.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.834
(phone ringing through)

32:01.878 --> 32:04.255
So, you cool down
a little bit?

32:06.507 --> 32:09.260
Well, would you
possibly reconsider

32:09.344 --> 32:10.595
coming to the party?

32:13.598 --> 32:14.641
Chloe, it's Pauly Paul.

32:14.724 --> 32:16.643
{\an1}What about everything
we talked about the other day?

32:16.726 --> 32:18.019

32:26.569 --> 32:27.820
{\an1}Chloe,

32:27.904 --> 32:29.656

anything. Where's--

32:52.553 --> 32:54.013
That's insane, dude.

Like, go get yourself
figured out
