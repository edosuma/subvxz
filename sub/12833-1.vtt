01:49.186 --> 01:51.983
Police department, zone one,
Sergeant Roberts.

03:33.753 --> 03:36.415
The search for the Polish Hill Strangler
confines...

03:36.490 --> 03:40.085
in the wake of the discovery
of yet a fourth victim this morning.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.094
The nude body of Arlene Dunn
of Mount Pleasant...

03:42.162 --> 03:44.027
was recovered from the Ohio River...

03:44.097 --> 03:45.529
by Pittsburgh River Rescue.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.493
The police have been alerted
to the crimes by the killer...

03:48.568 --> 03:53.230
who calls after each murder to play
the song "Little Red Riding Hood".

03:53.265 --> 03:55.905
The police brutality trial
of Detective Jimmy Detillo...

03:55.975 --> 03:58.136
came to a conclusion yesterday...

03:58.210 --> 04:00.303
when the jury brought in
a guilty verdict.

04:00.379 --> 04:04.509
Defective Detillo was convicted
for the May 20 beating of Leon Watson.

04:04.583 --> 04:07.143
Watson remains in a coma
in Mercy Hospital.

04:07.219 --> 04:10.120
The key to the conviction
was the surprising testimony...

04:10.189 --> 04:14.785
of homicide defective Thomas Hardy,
Detillo's partner and cousin.

04:14.860 --> 04:17.420
Defective Hardy was present
during Watson’s arrest...

04:17.495 --> 04:20.487
and testified that his partner
used unwarranted force.

04:20.565 --> 04:22.556
Sentencing is set for June 15.

04:22.634 --> 04:25.603
Come on, son. We're gonna be late
for the policemen's ball.

04:25.670 --> 04:29.936
- You gotta face 'em sooner or later.
- I feel like an asshole.

04:30.008 --> 04:34.445
Well, maybe you are an asshole.
You always were kind of strange.

04:34.512 --> 04:36.980
It's no wonder, growing up
with a role model like you.

04:37.048 --> 04:40.415
- You got that from your mother.
- Just leave Mom out of this.

04:40.485 --> 04:42.976
- Gladly.
- I see you got the boat fixed.

04:43.054 --> 04:45.989
Yeah. Putting it
in the water tomorrow.

04:53.497 --> 04:55.931
So, what's the latest
on Little Red Riding Hood?

04:55.999 --> 04:57.933
Nothing new.

04:58.001 --> 05:01.061
We get close; he slips away.

05:01.138 --> 05:04.539
We make a move; he makes a move.
I'm telling you, Dad, it's a cop.

05:04.608 --> 05:09.136
Maybe an ex-cop. Who knows?
Uncle Nick thinks so too.

05:10.914 --> 05:12.848
You talk to Uncle Nick about Jimmy?

05:12.916 --> 05:15.510
We talked around it.

05:15.586 --> 05:17.815
Look, every cop in Pittsburgh
thinks I'm a rat.

05:17.887 --> 05:19.821
Why should Uncle Nick
be any different?

05:19.889 --> 05:21.288
You're not a rat.

05:21.357 --> 05:22.790
You told the truth.

05:22.858 --> 05:24.018
Nick knows that.

05:24.093 --> 05:27.028
Yeah, well, look what
telling the truth has got me.

05:28.097 --> 05:30.031
I know what you're going through.

05:30.099 --> 05:32.192
You know what my dad used to say?

05:32.268 --> 05:34.202
Loyalty above all else...

05:34.270 --> 05:36.295
except honor.

05:36.372 --> 05:40.138
All units, we're in pursuit of a murder
suspect in a stolen '89 Ford.

05:40.209 --> 05:43.736
Dark blue. License:
Robert Harry X-ray 715.

05:43.813 --> 05:45.644
Oh, damn it!

05:45.715 --> 05:47.306
We just crossed the 31st Street bridge.

05:47.382 --> 05:48.872
Not today!

05:48.950 --> 05:50.850
Suspect is armed and dangerous.

05:50.919 --> 05:53.820
- Repeat: Armed and dangerous.
- Let's go.

05:53.888 --> 05:55.822
Maybe I won't have to go...

05:55.890 --> 05:58.290
to this goddamn
policemen's ball after all.

06:03.498 --> 06:05.090
Take Bigelow.

06:10.238 --> 06:11.728
Jesus!

06:13.174 --> 06:15.039
Why don't you have a date tonight?

06:15.110 --> 06:18.442
You're my date.
I didn't want you to be lonely.

06:19.747 --> 06:23.706
- What happened to that nurse?
- Nothing. It just didn't work out.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.581
You gotta give these things a chance.

06:34.328 --> 06:37.195
You know, that girl
that works for Dutch is awful nice.

06:43.470 --> 06:47.064
Is there some meaning
in all this, Dad?

06:47.140 --> 06:48.937
Grandkids.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.272
- What?
- Yeah.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.940
Hell, I'm not that grown up
myself yet, Dad.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.990
- There they are.
- Go down the alley.

08:04.715 --> 08:06.683
Jesus Christ!

08:13.590 --> 08:17.321
We got fire and two officers down in
the southbound tube. Send an ambulance.

08:33.275 --> 08:35.140
We'll trap him at Second Avenue.

09:22.023 --> 09:23.957
- Come here!
- Captain Hardy?

09:26.928 --> 09:29.522
Get out of the car now,
with your hands up!

09:34.869 --> 09:36.302
Uncle Nick.

09:36.370 --> 09:39.237
Excuse me.
Is this the policemen's ball?

09:39.307 --> 09:42.764
Well, nobody's going to the party
till we get this asshole out of the car.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.311
This is your last chance.

09:45.378 --> 09:48.472
Get out of the car
with your hands up!

09:54.054 --> 09:55.749
Here he comes.

10:09.002 --> 10:10.663
Let's go!

10:45.403 --> 10:46.836
Shit!

11:08.793 --> 11:10.657
Hang on.

11:27.544 --> 11:29.512
He drives like a cop.

11:40.056 --> 11:41.489
Pull up to him.

12:02.545 --> 12:04.843
All right. Come on, fellas. Easy.

12:05.982 --> 12:08.917
Jesus Christ! Take it easy.
Watch the leg.

12:12.354 --> 12:15.517
- Jesus Christ! My leg.
- You're all right.

12:17.058 --> 12:19.925
- Easy, pal.
- Something's wrong with my leg.

12:24.199 --> 12:27.691
- Where's Dad? Where's my dad?
- Tommy, listen.

12:34.009 --> 12:37.342
- Oh, no!
- He's been shot, Tommy.

12:37.412 --> 12:39.345
The killer got away.

12:41.949 --> 12:45.282
Oh, Daddy! Oh, Jesus Christ!

13:07.007 --> 13:08.496
Look who's here.

13:14.113 --> 13:16.946
- Sorry about your father.
- Thanks, Don.

13:17.016 --> 13:20.508
Just couldn't stay away,
could you, Tommy?

13:20.586 --> 13:23.316
You even had to come
to the goddamn sentencing.

13:23.389 --> 13:26.358
Wasn't bad enough you testified
against your partner?

13:26.426 --> 13:28.826
What, did you come down here
to gloat, you prick?

13:30.596 --> 13:32.621
Hey, Uncle Nick.

13:32.698 --> 13:34.131
Hi, Tommy.

13:35.868 --> 13:37.801
How you feeling?

13:37.869 --> 13:39.860
I don't know.

13:39.938 --> 13:41.872
How's the leg?

13:54.820 --> 13:56.754
I don't want to be here, Uncle Nick.

13:58.590 --> 14:01.024
You're a better man
than I am, kid.

14:01.093 --> 14:03.891
- They got your father's killer.
- What?

14:03.962 --> 14:07.397
They're bringing him up
for arraignment right now.

14:12.570 --> 14:14.003
What is this?

14:14.071 --> 14:15.504
His name is Kesser.

14:16.907 --> 14:19.705
What the hell is this?
He couldn't even lift those women.

14:19.777 --> 14:22.211
We have an eyewitness
who saw him dump a body.

14:27.118 --> 14:30.087
What the hell is going on here?
Even you said it was a cop.

14:30.154 --> 14:34.682
I said could be. Now we have
a witness that said it wasn't.

14:34.758 --> 14:37.225
When were you gonna tell me?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.488
Hey, Dad.
Come on. Let's go on in.

14:39.562 --> 14:41.029
I'll be right with you.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.597
Go ahead.

14:45.668 --> 14:48.330
Sit down.
I'll be right in.

14:50.673 --> 14:52.607
Now you listen to me.

14:52.675 --> 14:56.076
I don't want any problems with you.
Do you understand me?

14:56.146 --> 14:58.410
You should be glad we caught him.

15:10.859 --> 15:12.793
Where is he?

15:15.797 --> 15:18.265
A no-show at a police
brutality sentencing?

15:18.333 --> 15:21.268
They're gonna throw the book at him,
your son or not.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.804
Hear ye, hear ye.

15:32.881 --> 15:36.213
The criminal court of the commonwealth
of Pennsylvania is now in session.

15:36.284 --> 15:40.050
Sentencing for the State
versus Detective Jimmy Detillo.

15:40.121 --> 15:44.251
All rise. The honorable
Judge Hellen Kramer presiding.

15:49.997 --> 15:51.430
Mr. Gunther...

15:51.499 --> 15:54.991
- where's your client?
- We don't know, Your Honor.

16:05.745 --> 16:08.305
Jimmy, son, listen to me.

16:09.549 --> 16:12.416
Listen to Daddy, all right?
Come down, and we'll go talk to them.

16:12.485 --> 16:15.215
I promise.
We'll work something out.

16:17.791 --> 16:19.725
Mama went off this bridge.

16:20.727 --> 16:22.661
You remember?

16:22.729 --> 16:24.822
Never found her.

16:26.399 --> 16:28.560
Come on, Jimmy.
You don't have to do this.

16:31.071 --> 16:33.835
Cops don't go to prison, Dad!

16:36.408 --> 16:38.137
I don't go!

16:38.210 --> 16:40.576
Jimmy, we can work this out.

16:43.415 --> 16:46.509
What are you doing here?
You gonna give him a push?

16:53.525 --> 16:57.964
It's my partner.
My flesh and blood!

17:01.634 --> 17:05.069
Come on down, Jimmy.
You're scaring everybody.

17:05.136 --> 17:07.104
Yeah?

17:07.939 --> 17:09.839
Jimmy, don't!

17:10.907 --> 17:12.842
Who's the best cop now, huh?

17:13.778 --> 17:16.541
You, Jimmy.
Always you.

17:19.217 --> 17:21.151
Who's the best cop now?

17:23.820 --> 17:26.483
Always you, Jimmy.

17:26.557 --> 17:29.788
Come on, Jim.
Come on down.

17:29.861 --> 17:32.386
Come on, partner.

17:32.463 --> 17:34.726
Just take my hand.

18:00.757 --> 18:03.418
You motherfucker, Tommy!
You did this!

18:03.492 --> 18:06.757
Come on, Danny.
Let go of him!

18:11.300 --> 18:14.565
Fuck you! You did this,
you motherfucker!

19:00.982 --> 19:02.915
Oh, Bob.

19:04.251 --> 19:06.651
Don't lick me with that fish breath.

19:59.472 --> 20:03.134
I think he's still on the sauce.
He's probably sleeping it off somewhere.

20:03.208 --> 20:07.144
He doesn't know what "quit" means.
He's a fifth generation cop. He'll show.

20:08.146 --> 20:09.579
Oh, yeah?

20:10.782 --> 20:14.445
Who wants to bet, huh?
Twenty bucks says he don't show.

20:14.519 --> 20:16.714
- Hey, take it.
- You're on.

20:24.663 --> 20:26.722
Yeah. Thank you.

20:27.799 --> 20:30.426
Thank you very much.

20:30.501 --> 20:32.594
Tie that up for me, will you?

20:32.670 --> 20:34.103
Hardy!

20:36.140 --> 20:39.075
I've been calling you
for a fucking hour!

20:41.846 --> 20:44.007
You missed roll call.

20:45.549 --> 20:46.982
Penderman's really pissed.

20:50.621 --> 20:54.182
You look like shit.
You fall off the wagon again?

20:56.861 --> 21:00.023
It's five o-fucking-clock, man!
You're a fucking mess!

21:00.096 --> 21:02.087
I'm sick of taking shit for you.

21:02.165 --> 21:04.190
What am I supposed to put in the log?

21:04.267 --> 21:06.098
You wanna get that stern line?

21:06.169 --> 21:08.364
You're a real asshole.
You know that?

21:08.438 --> 21:11.066
All the guys in the division,
and I draw this prick.

21:12.375 --> 21:13.637
Shit.

21:22.986 --> 21:24.419
You bastard!

21:24.487 --> 21:27.615
Get some dry clothes on, Sacco.
I'll catch you on the next run.

21:27.690 --> 21:29.247
Goddamn it!

21:33.028 --> 21:34.962
This is River Rescue.
We have a seven...

21:35.030 --> 21:37.055
River Rescue 9221, this is Base.

21:38.867 --> 21:40.858
We have a 1-11, Shenango Works.

21:40.936 --> 21:43.427
One mile south of Neville Island,
north shore.

21:43.505 --> 21:44.972
Ten-four.

21:53.715 --> 21:55.706
Kim Lee, get Hardy.

21:57.219 --> 21:59.982
River Rescue 9221,
this is Base. Come in.

22:00.054 --> 22:01.919
9221. Go ahead.

22:03.424 --> 22:06.018
Hardy, this is Penderman.
I want you to get back here...

22:06.093 --> 22:07.526
and pick up Sacco.

22:13.968 --> 22:17.995
Malfunction on his radio, sir.
Like when you shut it off.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.355
- Jeff Schultz. Neville Township.
- Tom Hardy.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.864
- Where's your diver?
- He fell off.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.120
Open it up.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.390
Stand back, please.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.330
Shot in the pump.
Small caliber.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.493
- Been in the water 48 hours.
- Less.

23:23.569 --> 23:27.197
Twenty-four hours.
She's been dead 48, though.

23:27.271 --> 23:29.205
Somebody held onto her.

23:30.174 --> 23:32.108
Thank you, Jack fucking Webb.

23:33.277 --> 23:36.246
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Tom Hardy.

23:38.516 --> 23:40.575
The infamous.
Hi, Sid.

23:40.652 --> 23:42.586
- Hey, Captain.
- Hey, Uncle Nick.

23:43.521 --> 23:48.288
How are you? What do I have to do
to get you to call me, huh?

23:48.359 --> 23:52.125
I call you, Nick.
Your phone's always busy.

23:54.832 --> 23:57.925
- Danny is back.
- You're kidding.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.525
Where was he?

23:59.603 --> 24:01.594
California someplace.

24:02.906 --> 24:06.103
- What'd he say?
- Nothing much. You know Danny.

24:06.176 --> 24:09.976
- So how are they treating you?
- Good.

24:11.214 --> 24:14.547
- I heard Rossmore is retiring.
- Yeah, that's what they say.

24:14.618 --> 24:16.813
You gonna be the next chief?

24:16.887 --> 24:19.447
Not me, kid.
I'm just a Larimer Avenue dago.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.617
I hear they're gonna fry Kesser.

24:24.995 --> 24:28.987
Yeah. That's what
they do with killers.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.134
I'll see you around.

24:35.004 --> 24:36.995
Come on. Let's go.

24:37.073 --> 24:41.703
You know, Sid, when I grow up, I would
love to have a pair of shorts like that.

24:41.777 --> 24:44.712
- How's the wife, Eddie?
- None of your fucking business.

24:44.780 --> 24:46.907
Oh, yeah, that's right.
How would you know?

24:46.982 --> 24:49.348
Hey, you're his partner.
How's his wife?

24:49.418 --> 24:51.978
Let's go, you motherfucker!
Right now!

24:52.054 --> 24:55.386
- Jimmy was my friend, man!
- Eddie's picking on me, Uncle Nick.

24:55.457 --> 24:57.982
- Nobody's gonna forget what you did!
- Shut up, Eddie!

24:58.059 --> 25:00.323
One of these days,
it's gonna be just you and me!

25:00.395 --> 25:03.159
You belong on the river,
you fucking rat!

25:05.900 --> 25:08.960
Workers discovered the victim earlier
this evening in the Ohio River...

25:09.037 --> 25:12.666
near the Shenango Steelworks,
her nude body wrapped in a sheet.

25:12.741 --> 25:14.174
Police have identified her...

25:14.242 --> 25:17.006
as Cheryl Putnam of Monessen.

25:17.078 --> 25:20.605
Police defectives say that Miss Putnam,
a stewardess for Trans East Airlines...

25:20.682 --> 25:23.378
was apparently forcefully abducted
from her own apartment...

25:23.451 --> 25:27.079
before being taken to another location,
where she was murdered.

25:27.154 --> 25:29.952
The brutal crime reminds
many Pittsburgh residents...

25:30.023 --> 25:32.651
of the Polish Hill strangling
two years ago.

25:32.726 --> 25:35.354
Homicide defective Edward Eiler
had this to say.

25:35.429 --> 25:37.420
There's absolutely
no connection here...

25:37.498 --> 25:40.058
other than the victim
of a female Caucasian persuasion.

25:40.134 --> 25:44.298
The Polish Hill victims were strangled.
Cheryl Putnam was shot at close range.

25:44.371 --> 25:47.033
Douglas Kesser
maintains his innocence...

26:01.587 --> 26:03.020
Don't move.

26:03.089 --> 26:05.580
You picked the wrong house
to rob, asshole.

26:05.658 --> 26:09.150
Who are you kidding, Tommy?
You ain't got nothing worth stealing.

26:16.068 --> 26:17.535
It's been a long time.

26:17.603 --> 26:19.696
That's a good way
to get yourself killed.

26:19.772 --> 26:21.433
I wanted to surprise you.

26:23.142 --> 26:24.904
You surprised me.

26:24.976 --> 26:27.911
Give me a drink.
I almost broke my neck out there.

26:27.979 --> 26:30.914
I don't know why you want to live
in this fucking houseboat.

26:30.982 --> 26:33.815
You and your old man
should've burned this thing down.

26:33.885 --> 26:37.218
- Thanks. All right.
- How was California?

26:37.289 --> 26:38.722
Sunny.

26:40.392 --> 26:42.189
- Sunny?
- Yeah.

26:42.260 --> 26:44.592
After two years,
that's all you can tell me?

26:47.065 --> 26:49.192
"Simpsons" are on an hour earlier.

26:54.305 --> 26:55.738
You still mad at me?

26:58.309 --> 27:00.903
Yeah, well, I fucked up.

27:04.515 --> 27:09.475
After that night on the bridge,
I blamed you for Jimmy.

27:12.189 --> 27:13.952
Yeah, I blamed me too.

27:15.860 --> 27:18.420
I looked for you at the funeral.

27:18.495 --> 27:21.123
Ah, I couldn't deal with it.

27:21.198 --> 27:24.792
Another funeral with
an empty coffin like my mom's.

27:24.868 --> 27:27.359
Fucking river took half my family.

27:28.838 --> 27:30.465
Never get 'em back, either.

27:31.875 --> 27:33.308
Oh, wow.

27:33.376 --> 27:36.311
I was wondering what happened
to that picture.

27:38.514 --> 27:42.473
You, me and Jimmy at my dad's cabin.
All gonna be cops like our dads.

27:42.552 --> 27:45.953
Yeah. Brilliant idea.

27:47.657 --> 27:49.818
Look at us now.

27:49.893 --> 27:53.521
I mean, I'm a dropout,
Jimmy's dead...

27:53.595 --> 27:56.826
and you're one of those, uh,
what do you...

27:56.899 --> 27:58.526
Water dogs.

28:05.574 --> 28:07.940
It wasn't your fault
what happened to Jimmy.

28:08.010 --> 28:10.171
No, really.

28:10.245 --> 28:12.179
He had something wrong with him.

28:12.247 --> 28:15.341
No, he did. Like my mom.

28:15.417 --> 28:17.715
And nobody noticed it...

28:17.786 --> 28:20.050
till he beat the shit
out of that suspect.

28:20.122 --> 28:21.554
But I noticed it.

28:21.622 --> 28:24.284
I never did anything about it.

28:24.358 --> 28:26.986
- You did the right thing.
- Bullshit.

28:27.061 --> 28:30.292
You did the right thing.
Fuck 'em!

28:31.933 --> 28:33.867
Fuck 'em.

28:36.704 --> 28:39.195
So you back now?
You here for a while?

28:39.273 --> 28:41.571
Oh, I'm back.

28:41.642 --> 28:43.405
You wanna get something to eat?

28:43.477 --> 28:48.039
No, I gotta meet a girl.
I'll see you later, man.

28:56.056 --> 28:57.990
Welcome home, man.

29:14.474 --> 29:16.999
Hey, Kim Lee.

29:17.077 --> 29:18.704
How you doing, Hardy?

29:20.446 --> 29:24.576
- Who's Christman?
- Jo Christman, new diver.

29:24.650 --> 29:27.414
What's he like?

29:27.486 --> 29:29.420
Not what you expect.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.763
Come on in, Tom.

29:42.701 --> 29:44.862
Tom Hardy, Jo Christman,
your new partner.

29:44.937 --> 29:46.632
She's a police officer.

29:46.705 --> 29:48.935
Also qualified as a diver
and a paramedic.

29:50.274 --> 29:52.401
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

29:52.477 --> 29:54.411
Nice to meet you.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.113
Is this a joke?

30:08.526 --> 30:10.460
Can I ask you what he said?

30:14.098 --> 30:15.622
Thanks.

30:26.510 --> 30:28.478
I hope she floats.

30:40.357 --> 30:42.484
Want to get that stern line, please?

31:16.459 --> 31:19.484
Shit! Put it down!

31:40.014 --> 31:42.881
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

31:44.452 --> 31:45.885
Give me the bottle.

31:47.288 --> 31:48.754
Let me rephrase that.

31:48.822 --> 31:50.517
Give me the bottle now.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.734
You know this is a "no wake" zone?

32:01.802 --> 32:03.429
No, sir, I didn't.

32:03.504 --> 32:04.937
It is.

32:07.441 --> 32:09.409
Drive a little slower next time.

32:10.811 --> 32:14.747
- Wait. We have to give them a ticket.
- No, we don't.

32:14.815 --> 32:17.908
Yes. They were speeding.
We have to give them a ticket.

32:17.984 --> 32:21.249
Well, you better do it, then.
I'm not sure I can stand the excitement.

32:27.426 --> 32:29.360
Excuse me, sir.
I need your registration.

33:04.462 --> 33:07.761
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

33:46.469 --> 33:48.369
Take the wheel.

33:49.572 --> 33:52.939
Keep heading upriver.
Switch to channel eight.

33:53.009 --> 33:55.204
Tell Penderman to send backup.
Get outta here.

34:17.466 --> 34:20.196
River Rescue, this is 9221. Over.

34:49.397 --> 34:50.830
Land shark.

35:19.359 --> 35:20.792
Willy?

35:35.175 --> 35:37.541
How many men upstairs?

35:38.812 --> 35:40.780
Let me rephrase that.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.440
- Two, plus the pilot.
- Close your eyes.

35:44.783 --> 35:46.273
Just close 'em.

35:51.357 --> 35:53.825
Do you think we're stupid?
Where's the rest of the money?

35:53.892 --> 35:55.826
Where's the 200 grand?

35:55.894 --> 35:58.328
I say the word, he blows your head off.
You hear me?

36:00.132 --> 36:01.394
Pittsburgh Police.

36:03.535 --> 36:05.560
Now, we have two choices here.

36:06.372 --> 36:08.431
You either put the guns down...

36:08.507 --> 36:11.135
or we all start shooting.

36:23.221 --> 36:25.189
I'll blow his brains...

36:30.995 --> 36:33.088
- Hey, man!
- Hey, come on. Untie us!

36:33.164 --> 36:34.358
Get us outta here!

36:55.452 --> 36:57.079
Hardy, behind you!

37:14.170 --> 37:16.104
Thanks, Dutch.

37:20.476 --> 37:24.173
Hey, you did really good
out there tonight.

37:24.246 --> 37:26.146
Thanks, Hardy.

37:26.215 --> 37:28.206
Really good.

37:28.284 --> 37:29.717
Thanks.

37:36.425 --> 37:39.360
I never had a woman partner before.

37:39.428 --> 37:41.019
Neither have I.

37:50.405 --> 37:51.838
What a night.

37:51.906 --> 37:53.999
You guys are understaffed.

37:54.075 --> 37:56.976
Oh, no, baby.
This is the new "efficiency" system.

37:58.213 --> 38:00.738
- See you tomorrow.
- I switched with Mary Jane.

38:00.815 --> 38:03.750
Todd has Pirate tickets.
See you Wednesday.

39:06.546 --> 39:08.275
Goddamn it.

39:27.132 --> 39:29.066
Hello.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.506
Who is this?

39:40.444 --> 39:43.845
Who is this, goddamn it?
Answer me!

41:07.862 --> 41:09.796
What are you doing here?

41:11.332 --> 41:12.799
The bars closed?

41:12.867 --> 41:14.926
Just visiting some old friends.

41:17.071 --> 41:20.040
You don't have any old friends
down here.

41:20.107 --> 41:22.940
Who would know that better than you,
huh, scumbag?

41:26.947 --> 41:29.939
Yeah, "old friends".
Goddamn it.

41:30.017 --> 41:34.000
Motherfucker. Nick,
he was in the Polish Hill files.

41:41.961 --> 41:44.293
Listen, Tommy.
What are those?

41:45.365 --> 41:46.832
- What?
- That.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.333
- This?
- Yeah.

41:48.401 --> 41:50.995
Nothing. Some papers.

41:51.071 --> 41:56.475
There's an old Italian saying: Don't
scald your tongue on another man's soup.

41:56.543 --> 42:01.503
Yeah, there's an old Irish saying:
Never listen to old Italian sayings.

42:01.581 --> 42:03.981
I knew this was gonna happen.

42:04.050 --> 42:06.643
The minute I seen you at that body,
I knew it was gonna happen.

42:06.719 --> 42:08.311
You won't let go.

42:08.387 --> 42:11.515
You want me to go lay in some bed
for the rest of my life?

42:11.590 --> 42:13.524
My father's in the grave two years.

42:13.592 --> 42:16.390
The guy that killed your father
is wasting away in West Penn.

42:16.462 --> 42:18.987
Bullshit! A cop killed my father,
and you know it.

42:19.064 --> 42:22.033
Kesser never had the brains for this.
Why did you roll over on him?

42:22.101 --> 42:25.434
He was convicted by a jury
of his peers, based on evidence...

42:25.504 --> 42:27.495
- Why won't you answer me?
- I'm telling you!

42:27.573 --> 42:31.065
I loved your father,
and I love you like a son...

42:31.143 --> 42:34.874
but your father is dead
and this case is closed.

42:34.947 --> 42:37.938
If you can't accept that, that's your
problem. But I'm telling you something.

42:38.015 --> 42:41.849
I can take that gun and that badge
away from you right now...

42:41.919 --> 42:43.614
for initiating an illegal investigation.

42:43.688 --> 42:46.122
Is that what you want me to do?

42:46.190 --> 42:47.521
Is it?

42:47.592 --> 42:49.526
Do what you gotta do.

43:01.939 --> 43:03.907
We're out of our patrol zone.

43:06.810 --> 43:09.176
Will you at least tell me
where we're going?

43:10.580 --> 43:12.912
I'm gonna go visit a friend.

43:31.568 --> 43:34.196
I'm gonna break here for dinner.
I'll be back.

43:38.474 --> 43:39.941
Right.

43:41.377 --> 43:44.346
I'll just stay here
and watch the boat.

44:13.908 --> 44:15.341
Get you something?

44:15.410 --> 44:17.640
I'm looking for a guy named Chicanis.

44:19.948 --> 44:21.540
I haven't seen him all night.

44:24.953 --> 44:26.648
Chick! Hey!

44:34.061 --> 44:37.462
Now you're gonna tell me what you know.
Who told you to lie?

44:37.531 --> 44:39.465
- I didn't lie.
- Say the fucking name...

44:39.533 --> 44:41.364
or say good-bye, motherfucker!

44:41.435 --> 44:43.562
- Don't shoot me.
- Hardy!

44:43.637 --> 44:45.127
- Put up your gun.
- Now!

44:45.973 --> 44:48.134
No, Hardy.
Put up your fucking gun.

45:11.063 --> 45:15.329
Goddamn it!
This shit has got to stop.

45:15.401 --> 45:17.335
- If you have a drinking problem, fine.
- I wasn't drinking.

45:17.403 --> 45:19.667
- You're out of control.
- I wasn't drinking.

45:19.739 --> 45:22.367
- You're already on probation.
- How long have you been a cop?

45:22.441 --> 45:26.434
- What?
- How many years have you been a cop?

45:26.512 --> 45:28.742
- One year? Two years?
- Long enough to know the rules.

45:28.814 --> 45:33.409
Maybe you overlooked the one
about partners backing each other up.

45:33.485 --> 45:35.419
From what I hear,
you have no business...

45:35.487 --> 45:37.921
telling me how partners
should treat each other.

45:39.124 --> 45:41.251
I'm supposed to watch you
put a gun to someone's head?

45:41.326 --> 45:43.260
- I wasn't gonna shoot him.
- What were you gonna do?

45:43.328 --> 45:45.592
I'm trying to solve a murder.

45:45.664 --> 45:46.961
What murder?

45:50.735 --> 45:53.533
I hate to break this to you...

45:53.605 --> 45:55.937
but you are not
a homicide detective anymore.

45:56.007 --> 45:59.966
River Rescue 9221, this is Base.
Come in.

46:00.045 --> 46:03.741
- Go from Hardy.
- We got another 1-11.

46:03.814 --> 46:06.806
North shore, River Park,
east of Glenwood Bridge.

46:06.884 --> 46:08.408
Get the bowline.

46:08.485 --> 46:11.386
Yeah, this is Hardy.
9221. We're on our way.

46:11.455 --> 46:12.479
Let's go! Now!

46:31.674 --> 46:33.073
Over here!

47:00.902 --> 47:03.462
Oh, Jesus.

47:16.451 --> 47:21.286
Mrs. Wilson, if the kids have
any bad dreams, trouble sleeping...

47:21.356 --> 47:23.824
call this number,
and we'll send a counselor...

47:23.892 --> 47:25.325
free of charge.

47:25.394 --> 47:28.227
- Right.
- Probably want to get them home.

47:28.296 --> 47:30.695
Kids, come on.

47:30.765 --> 47:32.357
Let's go home now.

47:36.037 --> 47:38.062
Why didn't you ask if they saw anything?

47:38.139 --> 47:42.701
Because they didn't see anything.
The body was dumped upriver last night.

47:42.777 --> 47:44.039
How do you know?

47:45.846 --> 47:47.837
I used to be a homicide detective.

47:53.454 --> 47:57.151
- Round up the usual suspects, Eddie?
- Keep laughing, asshole.

48:04.230 --> 48:06.698
It's a sin what he turned into.

48:11.004 --> 48:12.596
Sorry to interrupt your evening.

48:13.673 --> 48:16.608
- We got a dead nurse.
- Jesus Christ.

48:18.078 --> 48:21.536
You stay here. You understand me?
Don't move.

48:22.849 --> 48:24.510
Absolutely, Dad.

48:25.819 --> 48:28.014
I wouldn't want to get in the way.

48:31.123 --> 48:33.114
What a prick.

48:35.427 --> 48:37.588
Paula Puglisi.
She worked Mercy Hospital.

48:37.663 --> 48:39.688
Same MO as the Putnam woman.

48:42.034 --> 48:44.127
Guess who she used to fuck.

49:12.730 --> 49:14.163
You knew her.

49:16.901 --> 49:17.833
Yeah.

49:19.237 --> 49:21.171
God, Tom, I'm sorry.

49:23.074 --> 49:28.204
That guy you were chasing back there has
something to do with this, doesn't he?

49:29.346 --> 49:32.679
- He was a witness in a murder case.
- The Polish Hill murders?

49:33.750 --> 49:35.183
Yeah.

49:36.253 --> 49:38.244
I was one of the investigating officers.

49:40.323 --> 49:41.915
Five women were strangled.

49:43.326 --> 49:46.193
During a high-speed pursuit
of the suspect, my father was killed.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.595
Chicanis said he saw the killer
dump one of the bodies.

49:53.670 --> 49:56.434
You don't believe him.

50:00.276 --> 50:02.676
This was the case
where you lost your shield.

50:11.420 --> 50:14.480
I lost my shield because I said
a cop killed my father.

50:25.467 --> 50:29.163
Want to give her one more pop
before they take her away?

50:29.237 --> 50:33.230
- How about I give you one more pop?
- Blow it out your ass, you lush.

50:33.308 --> 50:35.902
Go keep the press
out of Uncle Nick's face. That a boy.

50:35.977 --> 50:37.535
That's enough, all right?

50:40.982 --> 50:43.075
I thought you quit smoking.

50:43.151 --> 50:44.743
Gum didn't work.

50:45.987 --> 50:48.148
Who's she?

50:51.226 --> 50:53.626
That's my new partner.

50:53.695 --> 50:56.595
- Not bad.
- You didn't know nothing about that?

50:56.663 --> 50:57.891
No. Why should I?

51:03.904 --> 51:05.838
- Coming back to the force?
- Hell, no.

51:05.906 --> 51:07.498
See what you're missing?

51:18.452 --> 51:21.717
You want a little dinner?
We're going Italian.

51:21.788 --> 51:23.881
- Big surprise.
- I told you to stay up there.

51:23.957 --> 51:26.049
- I was inviting him to dinner.
- Go up there.

51:26.125 --> 51:28.423
- I just wanted...
- Go up there!

51:40.573 --> 51:42.473
He hasn't changed a bit.

51:42.541 --> 51:45.374
That's the problem. Come over here.
I want to talk to you.

51:53.619 --> 51:55.552
So what do you know?

51:55.620 --> 51:58.020
Nothing. Dead body in the water.
We fished it out.

51:58.089 --> 52:00.489
Please don't play games with me.
I'm tired.

52:00.558 --> 52:04.460
- I'm not Homicide anymore.
- I still want to know what you know.

52:05.697 --> 52:07.995
You don't want to hear
what I got to say.

52:08.066 --> 52:09.658
- Try me.
- It's the same guy.

52:09.734 --> 52:13.067
The same guy as what?
Are you talking about Polish Hill?

52:13.138 --> 52:15.834
- The woman had fair hair, good body.
- Your type exactly.

52:15.907 --> 52:17.898
These women were shot, not strangled.

52:17.976 --> 52:20.501
Both had neck bruises.
They were bound, wrist and ankle.

52:20.578 --> 52:22.978
- How do you know?
- Check it out. Ask Eiler.

52:23.048 --> 52:25.311
- Eiler told me you know her.
- A lot of guys did.

52:25.382 --> 52:28.545
- A lot of guys weren't fucking her.
- Goddamn it!

52:28.619 --> 52:31.053
What's the matter with you?

52:31.121 --> 52:34.557
I didn't know better, I'd think
you didn't want to solve this case.

52:34.625 --> 52:37.025
- Go fuck yourself.
- Are you a cop or not?

52:37.094 --> 52:40.291
You come up with some bullshit story
linking all these murders together...

52:40.364 --> 52:43.765
and just because you say it,
I'm supposed to swallow it like tripe.

52:43.834 --> 52:47.270
Let me ask you a question. When was
the last time you seen this girl?

52:47.338 --> 52:49.806
He's putting the bodies in the water
so I'll find them.

52:49.873 --> 52:53.138
- What?
- He wants me to find these girls.

52:54.544 --> 52:57.536
You're crazy, you know that?
You're nuts.

52:57.613 --> 52:59.137
He called me.

52:59.982 --> 53:01.415
He called you?

53:02.885 --> 53:06.878
- That's right.
- The murderer of these girls called you.

53:06.956 --> 53:08.947
- What'd he say?
- He didn't say anything.

53:09.025 --> 53:11.289
He didn't say anything
because you dreamed it.

53:11.361 --> 53:14.956
Now get in your little boat
and get the fuck out of here.

53:15.031 --> 53:16.623
Go catch a fish.

53:16.699 --> 53:19.793
You're an alcoholic, and you need help.
This isn't a joke anymore.

53:19.869 --> 53:24.032
If I were you, I'd see a psychiatrist,
get my head examined.

53:24.106 --> 53:27.667
Maybe you need a drink.
Might ease the pain of being wrong.

53:30.379 --> 53:33.542
Get away from me.
Get out of my sight.

53:37.986 --> 53:41.683
Didn't I tell you to keep those people
out of here? Get them back up the hill.

53:41.757 --> 53:44.885
Am I talking to myself?
Am I in this world all by myself?

53:44.960 --> 53:48.657
Get them people
back up the fucking hill.

53:48.730 --> 53:50.664
Put Grandpa back on.

54:01.208 --> 54:03.938
Yeah, she sounds good.

54:04.979 --> 54:06.412
Yes, me too.

54:10.384 --> 54:12.443
- Hi.
- Hi. You all right?

54:14.588 --> 54:16.522
Yeah, I'm fine.

54:23.563 --> 54:27.363
This is it. Sixteen months ago.

54:27.434 --> 54:30.426
I didn’t do if.
I didn’t murder anybody.

54:30.503 --> 54:33.472
This witness is lying.
He never laid eyes on me.

54:33.540 --> 54:37.374
One member of the Pittsburgh Police
Department agreed with the accused.

54:37.444 --> 54:38.877
Defective Thomas Hardy...

54:38.945 --> 54:42.142
didn't earn any new friends
with this statement to the press.

54:42.215 --> 54:45.707
No, I don't think Kesser is the killer.
I think he's the patsy.

54:45.785 --> 54:48.811
There was information not admitted
in this case that should have been.

54:48.888 --> 54:50.446
What information?

54:50.523 --> 54:53.218
All of the women were stunned
with police-issue tasers.

54:53.292 --> 54:55.886
Two of the women were called
from police call boxes.

54:55.961 --> 54:57.952
- Shut up.
- They were abducted from areas...

54:58.030 --> 54:59.759
where police response time is slowest!

54:59.832 --> 55:02.801
- Why didn’t you say that?
- Get him out of here!

55:02.868 --> 55:07.066
Because a Pittsburgh cop did if,
and you know if!

55:07.139 --> 55:10.131
An official police report
denied Hardy's accusations.

55:10.209 --> 55:11.801
As for Douglas Kesser...

55:11.877 --> 55:14.903
the controversy
has not changed the outcome.

55:14.980 --> 55:17.915
He has been sentenced to death
in the electric chair.

55:17.983 --> 55:21.349
Airtight case.
Kesser was a drunk, drifter.

55:21.419 --> 55:26.254
No alibi. He confessed to the murder
of a man we believe was his accomplice.

55:26.324 --> 55:29.487
Said it was self-defense.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.494
He denied any connection to Polish Hill.

55:31.562 --> 55:33.325
However...

55:33.397 --> 55:37.163
we recovered evidence from the murdered
women in Kesser's motel room...

55:37.235 --> 55:40.102
along with the gun
that killed Vince Hardy.

55:40.938 --> 55:43.168
Why does Hardy think Kesser was framed?

55:45.009 --> 55:47.773
We got Kesser on an anonymous tip.

55:47.845 --> 55:50.870
Kesser's fingerprints weren't
on the gun. It was a police special.

55:50.947 --> 55:52.505
Serial numbers were filed off.

55:52.582 --> 55:57.519
So Hardy starts barking conspiracy.
He thinks the killer's a cop.

55:58.688 --> 56:00.883
Did anybody else think Kesser
was innocent?

56:01.958 --> 56:05.018
Yeah. Kesser.

56:08.765 --> 56:10.323
Well, Bob...

56:11.268 --> 56:14.829
he's either putting them
in the Allegheny or the Monongahela.

56:16.439 --> 56:18.031
Narrows it down.

56:22.111 --> 56:24.045
This is Hardy here. Go.

56:25.180 --> 56:27.546
It's Jo. I was wondering...

56:27.616 --> 56:31.313
if you're going
to the policeman's ball tonight.

56:31.387 --> 56:36.324
I'm gonna go.
I don’t really know anyone...

56:36.392 --> 56:38.917
so maybe I'll see you there.

56:46.969 --> 56:48.402
Yeah.

57:08.990 --> 57:11.550
- Don't leave me...
- One drink. I'll be right back.

57:22.603 --> 57:25.629
- What the hell is he doing here?
- You believe the nerve of that bum?

57:29.509 --> 57:31.443
He's got a lot of balls coming here.

57:36.617 --> 57:38.949
Captain. He's here.

57:55.034 --> 57:58.936
You look, uh, different.

58:00.706 --> 58:03.072
I'll take that as a compliment.

58:05.645 --> 58:07.237
I didn't think you'd come.

58:08.748 --> 58:10.181
Nobody did.

58:12.284 --> 58:16.015
Hey, Tommy! You made it!
Good to see you, man.

58:16.088 --> 58:19.022
- How are you?
- Come on. The whole family's here.

58:19.090 --> 58:21.320
- I'm waiting for Danny.
- You can bring your friend.

58:21.393 --> 58:24.123
Dad, look who's here.
What'd I tell you?

58:28.933 --> 58:33.131
Let him go, Aunt Mary Ann.
We don't want to keep him waiting.

58:35.073 --> 58:37.667
- Good to see you, son.
- Hi, Uncle Fred.

58:39.411 --> 58:41.470
Ain't you gonna introduce your date?

58:42.547 --> 58:46.779
She's not my date. This is
my new partner, Officer Jo Christman.

58:47.785 --> 58:51.277
Unfortunately, these are the Hardys.
This is my Uncle Fred.

58:51.355 --> 58:54.017
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin Gary.

58:55.125 --> 58:57.457
- Don't fuck her.
- Yeah.

59:02.633 --> 59:06.399
- You have to come to our house and eat.
- She's right. You're too skinny.

59:06.470 --> 59:08.665
You gotta quit being such a stranger.

59:08.739 --> 59:12.402
Now, since we're all together,
I'd like to propose a toast.

59:12.476 --> 59:14.410
- To Vince Hardy.
- Hear, hear.

59:14.478 --> 59:16.412
Best Captain of Homicide ever.

59:21.551 --> 59:23.314
Let's drink to my mother.

59:24.387 --> 59:27.845
She was a Hardy too.
And how about we drink to Jimmy?

59:27.924 --> 59:29.824
Son, that's enough.

59:29.892 --> 59:33.487
Come on, Daddy. It's fitting
down here by the river, don't you think?

59:33.563 --> 59:35.656
Uncle Vince is dead.
They're dead too.

59:35.732 --> 59:38.701
You're gonna drink to him,
you're gonna drink to them. To Jimmy!

59:38.768 --> 59:40.929
- I said that's enough!
- No, it's not enough, goddamn it!

59:41.003 --> 59:43.198
- Come on.
- Get your fucking hands off me.

59:51.012 --> 59:53.071
Break it up, goddamn it.

59:59.187 --> 01:00:00.882
You fucking idiot!

01:00:02.924 --> 01:00:04.892
Get the fuck out!

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.587
Let go! I'm all right!

01:00:06.661 --> 01:00:08.526
You don't belong here!

01:00:08.597 --> 01:00:10.861
Me and you, Eddie.

01:00:10.932 --> 01:00:12.763
Anytime, jack-off.

01:00:14.603 --> 01:00:16.627
Come on.

01:00:16.704 --> 01:00:18.638
Best day of the year!

01:00:19.707 --> 01:00:21.299
Better than Christmas!

01:00:28.115 --> 01:00:30.208
Are these policemen all your relatives?

01:00:30.284 --> 01:00:33.549
No. They're just criminals
dressed up like policemen.

01:00:33.621 --> 01:00:35.555
How'd they all end up on the force?

01:00:37.024 --> 01:00:41.461
Just part of some big, nationwide
negative gene pool, I guess.

01:00:43.898 --> 01:00:45.489
Don't do that, okay?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.433
What?

01:00:48.501 --> 01:00:51.629
That thing where
you're not really talking to me.

01:00:57.310 --> 01:00:58.743
It's not the answer.

01:00:58.812 --> 01:01:02.646
Well, it'll do
until a real answer comes along.

01:01:13.526 --> 01:01:16.085
What the fuck is the matter with you?

01:01:22.434 --> 01:01:23.867
Get out.

01:01:25.003 --> 01:01:26.766
Get out now!

01:01:30.242 --> 01:01:33.177
You want to sit around here
and have a few drinks...

01:01:33.245 --> 01:01:35.179
and feel sorry for yourself?

01:01:35.247 --> 01:01:37.613
- Just go now, please?
- What is this?

01:01:37.683 --> 01:01:40.117
You won't respect yourself
until someone else does first?

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.854
Well, I respect you.

01:01:43.922 --> 01:01:47.789
It took a lot of courage for you to walk
in there and face the department...

01:01:47.859 --> 01:01:50.623
when you know they're waiting
to see you fall on your ass.

01:01:50.695 --> 01:01:53.493
- You're giving them what they want.
- No.

01:01:53.564 --> 01:01:55.156
They want me silent.

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:57.497
Stupid is almost as good.

01:01:59.604 --> 01:02:01.196
Go now, please.

01:02:03.207 --> 01:02:04.640
Just go home.

01:02:06.978 --> 01:02:08.912
No, I don't want to.

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:31.091
What are you doing?

01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:32.542
What made you decide
to become a cop?

01:04:35.087 --> 01:04:36.520
I mean...

01:04:37.923 --> 01:04:40.857
why would you want to put up with all
the horseshit you gotta go through...

01:04:40.925 --> 01:04:43.018
being a woman and all?

01:04:46.031 --> 01:04:48.727
When I was in college,
my roommate was raped.

01:04:49.934 --> 01:04:52.960
The campus police were only interested
in keeping it quiet...

01:04:53.038 --> 01:04:55.029
so I started poking around.

01:04:55.106 --> 01:04:58.701
I knew the guy was white.
He was very tall.

01:04:58.777 --> 01:05:02.679
So I started checking out
the basketball courts near the campus...

01:05:02.747 --> 01:05:05.807
and I took pictures
of all the white players.

01:05:07.118 --> 01:05:09.746
She identified him
from one of the photographs.

01:05:09.821 --> 01:05:12.482
- You caught the guy?
- Yeah.

01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:49.749
This is the Pittsburgh
Police Department.

01:05:49.826 --> 01:05:53.023
Pull the car over now
and stop the engine.

01:05:53.096 --> 01:05:55.758
Stop the car now,
or I will shoot.

01:05:56.499 --> 01:05:58.524
Take the wheel.

01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:03.766
All units, this is River Rescue 9221,
in pursuit of a murder suspect...

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.774
heading west
on the railroad service road.

01:06:05.842 --> 01:06:09.277
Mile 16 of the Monongahela.
Suspect is driving...

01:06:09.344 --> 01:06:12.040
a blue sedan, is armed and dangerous.

01:06:12.114 --> 01:06:13.547
Send backup.

01:06:14.716 --> 01:06:16.149
All units, respond.

01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:21.154
Shit.

01:06:22.057 --> 01:06:24.287
Hold it steady.

01:07:20.446 --> 01:07:22.778
What are we looking at here?

01:07:26.853 --> 01:07:29.344
Oh, my God!

01:07:29.422 --> 01:07:31.515
It's definitely a rug.

01:07:31.591 --> 01:07:34.560
Way to go, Hardy, you asshole.

01:07:35.628 --> 01:07:39.063
I told you it was a fucking rug.

01:07:39.131 --> 01:07:40.826
Congratulations.

01:07:40.899 --> 01:07:44.562
I'm proud of you.
We're all very proud of you.

01:07:44.636 --> 01:07:48.333
You chased away a litterbug,
blew up his car and recovered a carpet.

01:07:48.407 --> 01:07:53.003
- It looked like a body.
- You might consider a career change.

01:08:09.293 --> 01:08:12.990
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument...

01:08:14.332 --> 01:08:18.268
that it was the killer,
and it was a cop.

01:08:19.904 --> 01:08:24.773
It would be very easy for him to figure
out our patrol patterns, right?

01:08:24.841 --> 01:08:27.174
Then he'd just be waiting
for us to come along.

01:08:27.245 --> 01:08:28.872
Exactly.

01:08:28.946 --> 01:08:32.541
He dumps the rug
to make us look like morons.

01:08:32.617 --> 01:08:34.983
- It worked.
- Yeah.

01:08:39.389 --> 01:08:41.823
- Hardy?
- Yes?

01:08:44.928 --> 01:08:47.055
There's something I should tell you.

01:08:49.933 --> 01:08:51.867
Are you really a man?

01:08:56.273 --> 01:08:57.706
Good.

01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:02.144
But I was married to one.

01:09:05.314 --> 01:09:06.747
Cop?

01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:09.542
Worse. A lawyer.

01:09:11.453 --> 01:09:13.045
That is worse.

01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:18.059
We have a daughter. She's four.

01:09:20.362 --> 01:09:22.886
- What's her name?
- Sarah.

01:09:25.434 --> 01:09:26.924
Nice name.

01:09:29.004 --> 01:09:31.301
Thanks.

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.131
Is that it?

01:09:49.223 --> 01:09:51.520
We shouldn't be doing this.
We're partners.

01:09:52.794 --> 01:09:56.230
Yeah. We should be taken out and shot.

01:09:57.699 --> 01:09:59.496
We should shoot each other.

01:10:00.468 --> 01:10:02.265
Too much paperwork.

01:10:03.971 --> 01:10:05.403
I'm serious.

01:10:07.674 --> 01:10:10.438
Maybe you should consider
a career change.

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.905
What's wrong?
What's the matter?

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.443
- There was another murder?
- Yeah.

01:11:25.517 --> 01:11:27.747
Her name was Constance Cabrizzi.

01:11:29.421 --> 01:11:31.013
Used to call her Connie.

01:11:33.191 --> 01:11:34.782
You knew her too?

01:11:35.926 --> 01:11:38.053
I took her to the prom.

01:11:39.062 --> 01:11:42.463
Amazing coincidence, huh,
me knowing all these girls?

01:11:43.534 --> 01:11:45.764
You knew about the nurse.

01:11:46.904 --> 01:11:48.394
Now you know about Cheryl.

01:11:52.009 --> 01:11:53.943
And now Connie.

01:11:54.011 --> 01:11:58.004
- You've got to tell someone.
- Who would I tell?

01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.208
How would I know I could trust them?

01:12:01.452 --> 01:12:05.444
- I don't know how high up this goes.
- What do you mean?

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:08.649
Imagine if I told the wrong person.

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:11.124
- You didn't do this.
- Why?

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:13.321
Because it's such an obvious frame?

01:12:13.396 --> 01:12:17.059
Now I know why you've been so obsessed
with this and with Polish Hill.

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:20.466
There is no "this" and "Polish Hill"
like they were two separate things.

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:22.128
It's the same killer.

01:12:22.205 --> 01:12:24.435
He killed those girls in '91.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.499
He killed my father, and now
he's killing women out of my life...

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:31.013
and putting them in the river
so I'll find them.

01:12:32.447 --> 01:12:34.574
You're scaring me.

01:12:34.649 --> 01:12:36.480
It's scaring me too.

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:40.246
All the women in my life
keep turning up dead.

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:49.420
You are not listening to me.
I am telling you...

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:53.798
that there is absolutely no connection
between Polish Hill and these new girls.

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:56.429
If you print one hint of that
in your newspaper...

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:58.439
I am knocking you off this beat.

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:00.372
You'll get shit from now on.

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:03.535
Good-bye.
Goddamn it.

01:13:03.611 --> 01:13:07.103
The tip checked out. Hardy went
to high school with the Cabrizzi dame.

01:13:07.915 --> 01:13:10.315
That's two out of three.

01:13:10.384 --> 01:13:13.444
If we dig, I bet we can tie him
to Cheryl Putnam.

01:13:13.521 --> 01:13:15.955
- You want me to bring him in?
- No.

01:13:16.023 --> 01:13:18.583
Couldn't hold him
with what we've got anyway.

01:13:20.661 --> 01:13:23.391
We can put him under review.
I'm calling Internal Affairs.

01:13:23.464 --> 01:13:28.060
You can't do an IA unless he's been
under close surveillance for two weeks.

01:13:28.135 --> 01:13:29.727
He's been under surveillance
for three weeks.

01:13:29.803 --> 01:13:32.202
- Close surveillance?
- Doesn't get any closer.

01:13:32.272 --> 01:13:34.331
This is Detillo.

01:13:37.810 --> 01:13:39.744
Thank you, Officer Sacco.

01:13:39.812 --> 01:13:42.212
You may step down.

01:13:46.219 --> 01:13:49.086
I'd like to call
Detective Emily Harper.

01:13:58.064 --> 01:13:59.497
That's Jo.

01:14:06.705 --> 01:14:09.367
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you swear to tell the truth...

01:14:09.441 --> 01:14:12.274
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

01:14:12.344 --> 01:14:15.404
- I do.
- Please state your name for the panel.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:17.072
Detective Emily Harper.

01:14:20.352 --> 01:14:22.343
You are a member...

01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:26.357
of the Internal Affairs Division of
the Pennsylvania State Police, correct?

01:14:26.425 --> 01:14:27.858
Yes.

01:14:27.926 --> 01:14:30.257
Tell the panel, please...

01:14:30.328 --> 01:14:32.956
about your last assignment.

01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:34.622
The assignment had two parts:

01:14:34.699 --> 01:14:39.329
To rate Officer Hardy's competence as
a member of the River Rescue division...

01:14:39.403 --> 01:14:43.237
and to monitor his unusual interest
in the Three Rivers murder cases.

01:14:43.307 --> 01:14:45.935
You state in your report that
Officer Hardy consistently ignored...

01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:49.946
his River Rescue duties to pursue
an illegal investigation...

01:14:50.014 --> 01:14:52.414
into the Three Rivers murder case.

01:14:52.483 --> 01:14:54.417
That's correct.

01:14:54.485 --> 01:14:56.919
To what do you attribute
Officer Hardy's...

01:14:56.988 --> 01:14:59.547
unusual interest in this case?

01:14:59.623 --> 01:15:01.557
He believes that the murders
were committed...

01:15:01.625 --> 01:15:04.822
by the same man responsible for
the Polish Hill murders two years ago.

01:15:04.894 --> 01:15:06.486
A case he worked on.

01:15:06.563 --> 01:15:09.225
- That's right.
- Mr. Chicanis...

01:15:09.299 --> 01:15:11.233
a prosecution witness in that case...

01:15:11.301 --> 01:15:15.431
reported that Officer Hardy assaulted
and threatened him at gunpoint...

01:15:15.505 --> 01:15:18.065
and that you were forced to protect him
by threatening Officer Hardy...

01:15:18.141 --> 01:15:19.733
with your own weapon.

01:15:19.809 --> 01:15:21.333
No, that's incorrect.

01:15:22.912 --> 01:15:25.403
I drew my weapon as backup.

01:15:25.482 --> 01:15:27.109
Backup?

01:15:27.183 --> 01:15:28.945
That's what I call it.

01:15:30.986 --> 01:15:33.853
Officer Hardy was not...

01:15:33.922 --> 01:15:37.153
out of control and dangerous?

01:15:37.226 --> 01:15:38.955
At no time.

01:15:39.028 --> 01:15:41.997
- At no time during that...
- At no time whatsoever.

01:15:42.064 --> 01:15:44.328
Officer Hardy is courageous
and resourceful.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.096
His values are the finest.
I just wish...

01:15:47.169 --> 01:15:48.966
we had more officers of his quality.

01:15:49.038 --> 01:15:51.666
- Excuse me.
- That's my evaluation.

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:54.436
I was under the impression
that's what you brought me up here for.

01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:56.978
Thank you very much, Detective.
You may step down.

01:16:01.416 --> 01:16:03.350
Ten-minute recess.

01:16:31.478 --> 01:16:33.412
I'm sorry.

01:16:35.882 --> 01:16:37.873
Why did you change your testimony?

01:16:38.952 --> 01:16:40.544
Why do you think?

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.193
You cheat good.

01:17:44.649 --> 01:17:46.241
Emily, it's your father.

01:17:46.317 --> 01:17:49.582
Sorry we missed you.
Sarah just wanted to say hello.

01:17:49.654 --> 01:17:53.090
She's enjoying her visit.
Mom and I will see you Sunday.

01:17:53.158 --> 01:17:54.591
Bye.

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:57.893
Hi, Jo.

01:17:57.961 --> 01:18:00.759
I mean Emily.

01:18:00.831 --> 01:18:03.163
Never get used to that name.

01:18:03.233 --> 01:18:06.066
I wanted to tell you
it took a lot of courage...

01:18:06.136 --> 01:18:09.037
to do what you did today
at the hearing.

01:18:09.106 --> 01:18:11.802
Maybe we can talk.
Call me.

01:18:35.331 --> 01:18:37.265
Yes, I know you're hungry.

01:18:38.434 --> 01:18:41.028
Christ, you're always hungry.

01:18:41.103 --> 01:18:42.695
Go catch a rat.

01:18:44.607 --> 01:18:47.804
Let's see what our friends
at Coast Guard have for us.

01:18:55.617 --> 01:18:57.050
Let's see.

01:18:59.421 --> 01:19:01.946
Cheryl is one.

01:19:04.659 --> 01:19:08.026
Then Connie. That's 15.

01:19:09.264 --> 01:19:10.697
And...

01:19:14.769 --> 01:19:16.703
Nothing up there but cabins.

01:19:20.108 --> 01:19:22.303
Jesus Christ.

01:19:27.147 --> 01:19:28.876
Bob, will you get the...

01:19:34.488 --> 01:19:36.422
This is Hardy here. Go.

01:20:23.936 --> 01:20:26.871
Kim Lee! No!

01:20:34.279 --> 01:20:36.611
God! It stops now!

01:21:49.519 --> 01:21:52.248
Put your hands in the air, right now!
Where is she?

01:21:52.321 --> 01:21:54.346
- What are you talking?
- Where's the girl?

01:21:54.423 --> 01:21:56.948
- Where's who? Put that fucking gun down!
- Raise your hands!

01:21:57.026 --> 01:21:59.551
- I got your fucking note!
- What note?

01:22:00.596 --> 01:22:02.029
Jesus Christ.

01:22:16.211 --> 01:22:19.612
The police brutality trial
of Leon Watson ended today...

01:22:19.681 --> 01:22:22.672
with a guilty verdict
for Detective James Detillo.

01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:26.584
Detillo was convicted on three counts
of assault and reckless endangerment.

01:22:26.654 --> 01:22:29.350
The key to Detillo's conviction
was the testimony...

01:22:29.424 --> 01:22:31.619
of Detillo's partner, his cousin...

01:22:31.692 --> 01:22:33.956
Detective Thomas Hardy,
a witness to Watson's arrest.

01:22:38.166 --> 01:22:39.599
Surprised?

01:22:41.736 --> 01:22:43.203
Hello, Jimmy.

01:22:44.705 --> 01:22:46.138
I got ya.

01:22:50.044 --> 01:22:52.637
I got you fucking good,
didn't I?

01:22:55.248 --> 01:22:57.546
Yeah.

01:22:58.618 --> 01:22:59.710
Yes!

01:23:03.056 --> 01:23:05.115
What a world.

01:23:05.192 --> 01:23:07.786
It's really hard to believe,
isn't it?

01:23:07.861 --> 01:23:11.888
I jump off a bridge.
I don't die. Go figure.

01:23:12.632 --> 01:23:14.065
And you.

01:23:17.104 --> 01:23:20.937
Being so smart.

01:23:21.006 --> 01:23:25.204
That must be a real comfort to you...

01:23:25.277 --> 01:23:27.745
especially at a time like this, huh?

01:23:27.813 --> 01:23:29.246
- Jimmy.
- Shut up.

01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:32.981
You shut your fucking mouth!

01:23:33.052 --> 01:23:35.850
I loved you! You're my brother,
and you betrayed me!

01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:39.516
You betrayed me
for this worthless piece of shit.

01:23:39.592 --> 01:23:42.959
You knew I was the best cop!

01:23:43.028 --> 01:23:45.588
- Say it!
- Don't! Stop it, please!

01:23:45.664 --> 01:23:50.157
- Who's the best cop?
- Jimmy was the best cop!

01:23:58.209 --> 01:24:02.111
- What are you doing?
- Poor Danny. It's all right.

01:24:09.921 --> 01:24:12.048
Let's have a drink, huh?

01:24:12.123 --> 01:24:15.024
Come on. Me and you,
just like the old days.

01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:18.324
Remember how we used to drink
to old times?

01:24:18.396 --> 01:24:21.296
Look at me
when I fucking talk to you!

01:24:21.365 --> 01:24:23.663
What's the matter?
You're a drunk, aren't you?

01:24:23.734 --> 01:24:25.167
Come on! Drink!

01:24:31.542 --> 01:24:34.443
Are you too proud
to drink with a dead man?

01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:41.441
Maybe I should drink
with your little dove.

01:24:42.819 --> 01:24:44.377
Would you like that?

01:24:54.063 --> 01:24:57.032
- Leave her alone.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:25:09.712 --> 01:25:12.545
So I'm killing all these girls.

01:25:18.186 --> 01:25:21.121
He's riding next to me wondering,
"Who's doing it?"

01:25:22.424 --> 01:25:26.190
We're investigating the crimes together,
and I'm sitting...

01:25:26.261 --> 01:25:28.525
right next to my partner.

01:25:28.597 --> 01:25:30.929
You have been a very bad boy.

01:25:30.999 --> 01:25:33.593
You've been fucking
your brand-new partner, huh?

01:25:35.737 --> 01:25:38.228
Did you get fucked, honey?

01:25:38.306 --> 01:25:40.831
Don't feel too special...

01:25:40.909 --> 01:25:43.844
because Tommy's made a career
out of fucking his partners.

01:25:43.912 --> 01:25:46.437
- Let this girl go.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:25:46.514 --> 01:25:48.913
I'll kill you right now.
You see this, honey?

01:25:50.217 --> 01:25:52.651
- Bye-bye, Tommy.
- Don't kill me!

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.654
I like this game!

01:25:56.557 --> 01:26:01.051
You know why? Everybody dies,
and they all die with Tommy's gun.

01:26:01.128 --> 01:26:02.993
Now we got us a game.

01:26:06.634 --> 01:26:10.263
- Say good-bye to her.
- Don't do it! Please!

01:26:10.337 --> 01:26:11.895
Now we got us a game.

01:26:13.974 --> 01:26:16.670
Say good-bye to her.

01:26:19.979 --> 01:26:23.005
Put the gun down, son, all right?
Please?

01:26:23.082 --> 01:26:25.414
Listen to Daddy.

01:26:25.485 --> 01:26:28.249
- Put the gun down.
- What fun would that be, Dad?

01:26:30.490 --> 01:26:33.254
It's over, son.
Put the gun down.

01:26:33.326 --> 01:26:35.260
- Please.
- It's just starting.

01:26:35.328 --> 01:26:36.352
Please!

01:26:41.367 --> 01:26:43.301
I think Tommy
has some questions for you.

01:26:46.139 --> 01:26:48.333
Tommy? Comments?

01:26:48.407 --> 01:26:49.840
Come on.

01:26:52.978 --> 01:26:55.344
- Should I help him along?
- Don't, please.

01:26:55.414 --> 01:26:59.441
You know your dad...
God bless his Irish soul...

01:27:00.285 --> 01:27:01.718
he was...

01:27:01.787 --> 01:27:03.812
How should I put it, Captain?

01:27:03.889 --> 01:27:06.483
- Please don't.
- He was sort of killed.

01:27:12.431 --> 01:27:15.628
Captain, you want to tell Tommy
who killed his dad?

01:27:15.701 --> 01:27:17.327
Tell Tommy.

01:27:18.903 --> 01:27:19.870
Tell him!

01:27:27.478 --> 01:27:29.571
Don't move.
I'll fucking kill you.

01:27:30.414 --> 01:27:31.847
Son of a bitch.

01:27:42.393 --> 01:27:44.088
Get up.

01:27:44.161 --> 01:27:46.390
You son of a bitch.
Get up!

01:27:51.634 --> 01:27:53.101
Stop.

01:27:53.169 --> 01:27:54.193
I'll kill you.

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:56.761
I'm your son.

01:28:00.744 --> 01:28:02.336
Let me go.

01:28:20.829 --> 01:28:22.763
- Freeze!
- No, Vince...

01:28:22.831 --> 01:28:24.389
Stop or I'll shoot!

01:28:33.942 --> 01:28:35.375
I'm sorry.

01:28:36.545 --> 01:28:39.981
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:42.039
He was my son.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:46.909
But it's over now...

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:52.715
because we're going in
together.

01:28:58.766 --> 01:29:02.668
What are you gonna do, Dad?
You gonna shoot me?

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:05.171
Come on.

01:29:05.239 --> 01:29:06.672
Shoot me.

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:13.146
Couldn't do it before.
You don't have it in you.

01:29:23.023 --> 01:29:24.615
Shoot your own son?

01:29:28.028 --> 01:29:31.088
There goes that gold watch.

01:29:36.403 --> 01:29:38.132
Hail Mary, full of grace...

01:29:41.608 --> 01:29:44.269
Who's the best cop?
A bulletproof vest!

01:29:44.343 --> 01:29:46.607
Who's the best cop now?

01:29:55.688 --> 01:29:57.622
You motherfucker! Come here!

01:29:59.725 --> 01:30:02.558
Come on, Jimmy! Me and you!

01:30:05.064 --> 01:30:07.123
Run, you son of a bitch.

01:30:16.474 --> 01:30:19.341
I just want to talk to you.

01:30:29.087 --> 01:30:30.145
Come on.

01:30:38.263 --> 01:30:40.925
Why are you making me chase you?

01:30:41.733 --> 01:30:43.427
Come on.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.365
Are you mad at me?

01:30:47.437 --> 01:30:48.904
Just shot my dad.

01:30:55.612 --> 01:30:57.045
Call me.

01:30:57.114 --> 01:30:59.048
No, I'll call you.

01:31:11.827 --> 01:31:13.260
Fan out.

01:31:16.198 --> 01:31:18.844
Coffey! Get these handcuffs off me!

01:31:18.879 --> 01:31:22.994
- What the hell you doing handcuffed?
- Where's Detillo? What's going on?

01:31:23.072 --> 01:31:27.236
Get these off!
Get up there. He's been shot. Get off!

01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:29.801
I'm not getting off.

01:31:35.551 --> 01:31:37.883
You son of a bitch!

01:31:43.291 --> 01:31:44.417
Fuck!

01:31:56.504 --> 01:31:58.301
Come on!

01:31:58.373 --> 01:31:59.738
Watch your head!

01:32:14.021 --> 01:32:15.181
Try to fuck me.

01:32:23.397 --> 01:32:24.830
Get away!

01:32:32.673 --> 01:32:34.504
Stop it!

01:34:08.364 --> 01:34:10.764
You could never beat me!

01:34:56.211 --> 01:34:59.271
- You like to jump off bridges?
- No. Of course...

01:36:16.288 --> 01:36:18.552
Who's the best cop now?

01:36:49.888 --> 01:36:52.379
You gonna be all right, sir?

01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:03.266
- Can somebody take these off me?
- I need some handcuff keys.

01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:23.917
I was a real shithead.
Guess you want to take a shot at me.

01:37:26.757 --> 01:37:28.349
Wouldn't do any good.

01:37:34.764 --> 01:37:36.356
On the other hand...

01:37:37.859 --> 01:37:38.759
Hardy!

01:37:40.468 --> 01:37:41.504
Hardy.

01:37:45.841 --> 01:37:47.274
You okay?

01:38:17.505 --> 01:38:18.938
Grandkids, Dad.
