WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
.

00:06.720 --> 00:07.880
We're back.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.320
Let's fucking do this!

00:13.360 --> 00:14.440
Come on!

00:16.320 --> 00:17.360
More pulling.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.360
More getting mortal.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.080
More fights.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.320
Fuck!
Don't you fucking ever!

00:26.520 --> 00:28.280
Things are about to go crazy.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.720
Now it'll just be carnage.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.200
I have lost the love of my life.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.160
I'll never forgive him for it.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.240
I didn't want anything
to fucking do with him!

00:39.320 --> 00:42.760
I can't contain this anger any more.
Marnie, Marnie, come here!

00:42.840 --> 00:45.960
Fuck off, love.
You're the cheat, not me.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.480
This whole time, four years,
has been a lie.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.080
It hasn't though.
It has! Yes, it has.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.400
It's just bullshit.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.080
She's all ower us.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.440
Aaron and Chloe! Eh?

00:57.520 --> 01:00.200
She's supposed to be me mate.
I'm gonna go.

01:00.280 --> 01:02.040
Me leaving is make or break.

01:02.120 --> 01:05.280
She's gone, Kyle. Holly's left
without saying goodbye to us.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.680
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.760
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.680
Hardest graft is doing me hair.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.600
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.880
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.960
I'm totally crackers me like.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.760
I'm preened to perfection.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.640
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.840
I'm fit, flirty with double Fs.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.400
I'm gonna make sparks fly,
get everyone feisty.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.120
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

01:42.560 --> 01:47.160
I've woken up and I'm still gutted
that Holly's left last night.

01:47.240 --> 01:51.840
It kills me I wasn't there to say
goodbye or to stop her from going.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.960
Kyle might not be ready but Holly is.

02:05.040 --> 02:08.720
If Kyle had showed more commitment,
Holly would still be here.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.840
I slept on the sofa with Chloe,
when I went to bed

02:16.920 --> 02:19.440
I pissed in the bin.
What's wrong with me?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.200
Get in.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.000
Nothing's going on with me and Chloe

02:28.080 --> 02:32.400
but I'm glad Marnie saw we cuddling.
She's acting like a complete dick,

02:32.480 --> 02:34.720
so I couldn't give a fuck.
Take that bin out.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.400
Urgh!

02:38.480 --> 02:40.640
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

02:41.720 --> 02:44.480
It stinks!
(laughs)

02:50.120 --> 02:51.320
I know.

02:51.400 --> 02:56.560
The girls' bedroom is so lonely
this morning. Chloe's not here

02:56.640 --> 02:58.960
and Holly's not here.
It's just me and Marnie.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.880
It's a shame that Kyle
couldn't be this upset

03:11.960 --> 03:14.120
when Holly was actually
in the house.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.400
It's took her leaving
for him to realise.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.720
I hope when she comes back,
he pulls his act together.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.200
I was shocked like.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.120
I'm quite shocked at Chloe
because... Like...

03:29.200 --> 03:32.240
You'd think that she would
avoid that at all costs.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.280
In this house Aaron
is Marnie's property.

03:35.360 --> 03:40.160
Even though they're not speaking,
Chloe spooning him was a bad move.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.040
There's gonna be ructions.

03:49.040 --> 03:52.680
What the fuck happened last night?
All I remember is

03:52.760 --> 03:54.400
top-knots and tattoos.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.760
(sighs) Oh, no.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Chloe clearly isn't as innocent
as what everyone thinks.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.440
She lay on a settee with Aaron,
God knows what's happened?

04:04.520 --> 04:07.120
I wanna talk to her and find out.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.400
Hiya, Chloe.
Hi.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.080
Are you all right?

04:15.120 --> 04:17.320
How am I gonna talk meself
out of this?

04:17.400 --> 04:21.120
Me and Marnie are such good friends,
I'd hate to fall out with her.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.080
Literally, nothing happened at all.

04:23.160 --> 04:27.000
I wouldn't do anything cos of what
you've been through with Aaron.

04:31.080 --> 04:35.480
I told Chloe it's fine if she gets
with Aaron but be serious, it's not.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.240
Chloe should respect our history.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.520
I shouldn't be the one
to tell her to back off.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.800
So am I.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.440
We're missing Holly and Scott
and there's bad vibes in the house.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.400
Do you think that'll stop us
going out? Will it fuck!

05:06.840 --> 05:09.840
I wanna get to Tiger Tiger
and get fucking on it.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.040
We get to Tiger Tiger
and it's absolutely bouncing.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.320
Let's get fucking mortal.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.560
Me and Marnie are trying to have
a good night but it's awkward.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.840
We still aren't speaking
to Gary and Aaron

05:37.920 --> 05:40.080
but we're not gonna make
the first move.

05:42.600 --> 05:46.960
I would rather go through all
of this awkwardness and tension

05:47.040 --> 05:51.440
than speak to Aaron. He hasn't even
fucking apologised to us yet.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.800
Aaron and Gary will never ever ever
admit when they're wrong.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.280
They've got too much pride
and they're egos are far too big.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.640
Me and Aaron are determined not to
let all this shit spoil our night.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.960
The drinks are flowing,
the tunes are wicked.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.680
I always love a little flirt.
Marnie isn't talking to us

06:29.760 --> 06:33.080
but Chloe is. Fucking come here,
you little radgie.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.760
I told Chloe she should go there
with Aaron

06:41.840 --> 06:45.480
but seeing them all over each other
is starting to piss us off.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.000
I'm having such a good night

06:48.080 --> 06:51.080
and Aaron's all over us
and he's looking canny fit like.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.360
Chloe and Aaron
are all over each other.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.800
I can see Marnie's face
and she doesn't look happy.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.000
If I was her,
I would be fucking raging.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.280
I'm very surprised we got through
tonight without any arguments.

07:14.360 --> 07:17.520
We've had a wicked night.
It's time to get home.

07:32.640 --> 07:36.720
We're back and I'm making some food.
I'm absolutely mortal.

07:39.200 --> 07:42.800
I was getting jealous when I seen
Aaron flirting with Chloe.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.960
It's made us realise
it's better when we get along.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.720
It's for us to make up.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.840
You were...

08:00.000 --> 08:03.520
Wait a second, so Aaron
was all over Chloe in the club.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.880
We've came back and now Marnie's
fluttered her eyelashes

08:06.960 --> 08:08.800
and he's gone running back.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.480
Chloe do not look happy.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.720
I look across the bedroom
and see Marnie and Aaron flirting.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.200
She said I could go there
what the fuck is she doing?

08:19.520 --> 08:23.400
I know for a fact, Aaron doesn't
give a shit about Chloe.

08:23.480 --> 08:26.800
He's slipped straight back into
Aaron and Marnie flirting again.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.520
What you doing,
you fucking dickhead?

08:31.600 --> 08:35.840
Chloe is going off on one. I have
no idea where this has come from.

08:36.920 --> 08:39.600
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

08:39.680 --> 08:42.080
This is the first time
I've seen Chloe kick off.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.240
She has got a little devil inside.
She's going mad.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.120
I hate this fucking house!

08:47.200 --> 08:50.400
I'm getting so angry.
I'm getting mugged off.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.480
I'm foaming!

08:51.560 --> 08:55.120
Chloe is kicking off.
She's like a raging bull.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.800
And Aaron and Marnie
are her red rag.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's glass, man.

09:00.960 --> 09:05.480
Everyone's two-faced. It just goes
to show, you can't trust anyone.

09:05.560 --> 09:07.920
Marnie's downstairs with Aaron.
It should be me.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.600
And then...
Fuck it, what's gaaning on?

09:17.680 --> 09:20.400
In the room,
the mirror's smashed to bits.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.920
Now Gary's deciding to be Chloe's
knight in shining armour.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.120
How very sweet of you, Gary.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.480
Cock!

09:29.000 --> 09:30.400
Me hand's not hurting.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.600
That didn't hurt one bit.

09:32.680 --> 09:36.000
Oh! Poor Chloe.
"How's your hand, Chloe?"

09:36.080 --> 09:37.560
"Are you OK, Chloe?"

09:37.640 --> 09:41.720
Why don't they ask her why she
punched the fucking mirror?

09:41.800 --> 09:43.800
Chloe, what's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.480
There clearly is
cos you've punched a mirror.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.440
Why are you getting angry
over me speaking to Aaron?

09:52.040 --> 09:54.200
Why have you smashed a mirror?

09:57.800 --> 10:02.120
Now Chloe's changing her story. Does
she fucking know why she's angry?

10:02.200 --> 10:05.200
This girl is doing my fucking
head in tonight.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.600
Fucking mirror!
Chloe!

10:07.680 --> 10:09.880
(shouts) Fuck off!

10:09.960 --> 10:14.280
No. Come here. I need to get out
before I smash anything else.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.760
(shouts) I don't like anyone!

10:25.120 --> 10:27.520
What the fuck
is wrong with this girl?

10:27.600 --> 10:30.600
She's smashed the mirror.
She's ruined the night.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.600
Now she's screaming
like some banshee whore.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.120
Chloe, man! Shut the fuck up!

10:37.200 --> 10:40.600
Shit. I've seen this before.
Chloe, meet Psycho Charlotte.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.160
Shut up!

10:46.760 --> 10:48.400
You need to shut the fuck up.

10:48.480 --> 10:52.880
Guess what, mate? That makes me want
to fucking make even more noise.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.960
Fuck up.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.440
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.320
All I wanted
was to make the screaming stop.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.920
But now I've got me hand over
her mouth. Whoops.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.040
Don't tell me...
Who the fuck are you hit- Chloe!

11:09.120 --> 11:11.720
Who the fuck are you kicking?
Charlotte!

11:13.000 --> 11:17.480
Don't tell me to shut the fuck up!
Who the fuck are you kicking, man?

11:17.560 --> 11:19.560
You stupid fucking slut.

11:19.640 --> 11:23.840
This has turned into a full-blown
fight. I am fucking furious.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.800
Charlotte, Charlotte.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.080
Charlotte's lost it.
They're getting vicious.

11:31.160 --> 11:34.040
I'm pinning Chloe down.
And Kyle's got Charlotte.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.680
If anything, Gary should be pulling
me back. Seeing if I'm OK.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.320
But he's sitting with Chloe.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.920
Her! Her! I'm fucking-
Yes, her!

11:58.400 --> 12:02.920
I don't fucking deserve this. I was
trying to protect you, not Chloe.

12:06.480 --> 12:09.400
Charlotte has flipped the fuck out.
There's only one person

12:09.480 --> 12:12.520
who can calm her down
and it's definitely not me.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.920
(sobs) I wanna go.
Talk to me.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Listen. Calm down.
Charlotte, calm down.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.680
Come on, calm down.
I wanna go home.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.160
I hate seeing Charlotte like this.
She's still one of me best friends,

12:30.240 --> 12:33.040
and I'll still be there for her.
It's fine.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.880
All this anger isn't about Chloe.
It's been bubbling

12:37.960 --> 12:40.760
since Charlotte found out
about Gary having a girlfriend.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.560
This is just an outburst
of pure frustration.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.400
I feel so sorry for Chloe.
Firstly she's got caught up

12:48.480 --> 12:51.520
in Aaron and Marnie's games.
And now Charlotte's coming at her.

12:51.600 --> 12:55.440
I look so bad. I look so bad.
Man, fuck up, shut up.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.680
No, you don't. Yes, I do.
No you don't. At all.

13:03.800 --> 13:08.520
Char's flipped for no reason.
What did I do to deserve this?

13:13.600 --> 13:14.840
Tonight's been a disaster.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.880
All I wanna do is go home
and have a good night's sleep.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.840
And I'll come back tomorrow. (sobs)

13:24.440 --> 13:27.640
Nathan's been really sweet.
We've got a really good bond.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.280
I don't know
what I'd do without him.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.800
Now that I've calmed down,
I've realised that Gary

13:46.880 --> 13:48.520
was there for us tonight.

13:48.600 --> 13:53.080
And I was the one that acted like
a total dick. I feel so guilty.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.400
No.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.480
Charlotte needs to know
that whether we're talking or not,

14:04.560 --> 14:08.720
if she has a fight, I'm always gonna
back her up. I'll be there for her.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.360
Right?
Yeah.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.400
Do you know what I mean? But...

14:14.480 --> 14:16.920
I'm so glad
me and Gary are talking again.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.880
Whatever happens, I know he's always
gonna be there for us.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.840
Come here.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
I can't believe what's happened. Me
and Chloe should never have fought.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.360
I hope we can resolve this tomorrow.

14:51.880 --> 14:56.600
We've woke up and the girls' bedroom
looks like a fucking bombsite.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.680
More than usual.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.760
How are you feeling?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.840
Oh, Jesus Christ.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.960
(sighs)
Morning!

15:04.040 --> 15:08.320
Nathan's come upstairs with a cup of
tea. God knows what he thinks of me.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.600
I was an absolute idiot last night.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.880
Why did you go for her?

15:12.960 --> 15:17.280
I didn't go to hit her or anything.
I went to try and shut her up.

15:17.360 --> 15:21.920
But I took it too far
and kind of... muzzled her.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.600
And then it wasn't funny
because I was aggressive with it.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.560
Even though Chloe was a dick, I
should never have covered her mouth.

15:30.640 --> 15:34.680
That's what made things ten times
worse, and I totally regret it.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.480
When she gets back, you should just
go through things with her.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.160
If she'd stayed, stood her ground-
Has she gone?

15:41.240 --> 15:44.360
She went last night.She's no need
to worry. We always make up.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.400
I definitely wanna sort things out.

15:46.480 --> 15:50.440
I know how she would've felt and I
don't want anyone to feel like that.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.800
I hope when she comes back,
everything can go back to normal.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.280
Howeh then, let's get ready.

16:02.440 --> 16:06.320
Everyone's spirits are low.
And the atmosphere is down.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.240
There's only one thing
that can pick us up.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.080
Yes.

16:14.320 --> 16:17.840
H-O-U-S-E! House party, house party,
house party, whoo!

16:20.400 --> 16:22.120
That's a good idea mind.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.000
This should be wicked
to bring everyone back together.

16:25.080 --> 16:28.920
We need Chloe and Holly back. Then we
can sort everything out, for good.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.240
Charlotte, you ring Holly.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.080
Howeh, then!

16:36.840 --> 16:40.280
This party is the perfect
opportunity to get Holly back here.

16:40.360 --> 16:43.200
I hope she knows
how much I'm missing her.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.600
Hello.
Holly.

16:44.680 --> 16:48.160
Hi.Oh, God.
I've missed you so much.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.400
Like, literally. How are you anyway?

16:57.920 --> 17:01.400
I'm glad you're feeling better.
We're having house party night.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.560
It's House of Horrors theme.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.760
Shit, no. I didn't even know that.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.040
Right, OK.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.360
Right, I'll speak to you soon.
Bye, Hol.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.720
Yes! Holly's coming back.
Now it's just down to Kyle

17:22.800 --> 17:26.440
to show her how much he cares,
then everything will be right again.

17:26.520 --> 17:30.120
How did it go? Is she all right?
So good. She's coming tonight.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.720
Get in. Holly's coming to the party.
I cannot wait to see her.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.560
Do you know what you're gonna?
No, not yet.

17:36.640 --> 17:40.840
Are you gonna marry her? Have all
her babies? I'm not gonna do that.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.000
Why?

17:42.080 --> 17:43.680
Because. Just wouldn't.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.920
You will marry her one day though.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.680
(both) Why?

17:57.040 --> 17:59.800
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.160
I thought everything
was OK with them.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.920
Now he's saying he can't see a
future with her. What the fuck?

18:06.920 --> 18:11.040
What's the point of it? What's the
point if you can't see a future?

18:11.120 --> 18:14.120
I don't get with someone
to think I'll marry her

18:14.200 --> 18:15.800
but because I like her.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.920
Fucking hell. I do not wanna be
having this conversation.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.920
Surely you can see some sort of
future if you're with them?

18:24.480 --> 18:27.520
Fuck me.
I wouldn't wanna be Kyle right now.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.760
Is that the reason why you
wouldn't make it official?

18:32.560 --> 18:35.920
Taking it slow to what? Never gonna
be, you're never gonna...

18:36.800 --> 18:38.040
Cos you've just said.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.880
It doesn't matter how young Kyle is.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.000
If you're with someone,
you wanna be with them forever.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.040
I know it's not right but I am
bothered about Holly's past.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.360
That's the main reason
I don't wanna commit.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.360
There she is.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.440
Hi.
I'm feeling really really awkward

19:11.520 --> 19:14.560
after last night. I don't know how
girls will be with us.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.360
Do you wanna go upstairs and talk?
Yeah, howay.

19:19.160 --> 19:23.480
Chloe's back. And the first thing
I wanna do is clear the air.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.360
We need to get this sorted.

19:26.360 --> 19:31.800
Firstly, I need to just apologise,
for obviously us having that fight.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.400
I'm not wasting any time.

19:33.480 --> 19:37.360
I need Chloe to know that I'm sorry
and I was a complete dick.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.160
I didn't mean us
to have a fight at all.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.360
No, I didn't wanna have a fight.
It just happened so quick.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.840
Shit, I'm sorry for putting you on
the floor. I didn't mean to-

19:47.920 --> 19:51.720
I didn't... I wasn't doing it
in like an aggressive manner.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.360
I was just trying to shut you up.

19:54.440 --> 19:58.840
I feel so relieved that Charlotte's
apologised. I was in the wrong too.

20:01.120 --> 20:05.600
That just shouldn't happen.
Arguing with yous, over a stupid boy.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.880
I've always identified Aaron
with me.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.080
Then to see you on the settee
with him.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.840
That made me feel like a mug.
I wish you'd just told us that.

20:13.920 --> 20:17.560
I was trying to do the best thing,
rather than make things awkward.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.240
I wish you'd said it.

20:19.320 --> 20:23.080
I wish you'd just told us the truth
that you liked him.

20:23.160 --> 20:27.080
In a way me and Chloe were trying
to protect each other's feelings.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.360
If we had, this whole situation
could've been avoided.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.600
Maybe we should've all been
a little bit more honest.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.520
Yeah, just be honest.
Yeah, definitely.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.240
Come and give us a hug, Chloe.

20:38.320 --> 20:42.120
Don't feel awkward. Everything's
forgotten about. Group hug?

20:42.200 --> 20:47.200
I'm happy me and the girls are OK.
No boy is worth fighting a girl for.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.200
Now that everything's
finally sorted with Chloe,

20:55.280 --> 20:58.880
it's time to get this house ready
for the party tonight. (gasps)

21:07.880 --> 21:12.560
Everyone's getting ready
and the house is looking terrifying.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.040
(laughs)
Uh!

21:14.120 --> 21:15.240
Ah!

21:16.960 --> 21:21.720
Holly's on her way. I hope we're all
friends at the end of the night.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.040
(all) Geordie Gore!

21:32.120 --> 21:34.720
Geordie Gore! Whey-aye!

21:36.760 --> 21:41.520
This is me first house party. I'm
gonna make it the best one ever.

21:41.600 --> 21:46.040
Lillie's coming to the house party
tonight. And yeah, it might kill us.

21:46.120 --> 21:49.640
But you know what they say about
cats. They've got nine lives.

21:54.560 --> 21:58.400
I can't believe me friends are here.
I'm so excited to see them.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.560
People are starting to arrive. It's
actually making me really worried

22:06.640 --> 22:09.880
about seeing Holly.
I'm actually nervous. What the fuck?

22:18.840 --> 22:22.320
Lillie walks in
and I can't get over quick enough.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.920
It's never gonna not break me heart,
seeing Gary with Lillie.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.840
I'm gonna do the right thing.
And not make a big deal about it.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.880
Gary was so supportive last night.
Now it's my turn

22:41.960 --> 22:45.920
to prove that I can be,
and will be, a good friend to him.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.040
This party is fucking wicked.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.360
I've got three girls all over us.
I'm looking mint.

22:58.440 --> 23:03.200
Well, it looks like Aaron's latched
himself onto them three girls.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.680
Fine Aaron. Do what you want.
See if I care.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.800
There's still no sign of Holly.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.240
I hope she gets here soon.
I'm dying to know where I stand.

23:16.320 --> 23:21.440
This time apart, has just reinforced
how much I care about Kyle.

23:21.520 --> 23:24.680
I hope that when I go back,
he's felt the same.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.680
I walk in and I see Kyle
and I have never

23:31.760 --> 23:34.320
been so pleased to see someone, ever.

23:36.920 --> 23:40.520
Fuck me. I thought Holly was fit
before. But now, she looks amazing.

23:43.800 --> 23:47.040
Kyle and Holly look so happy to be
in each other's arms.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.120
There's no chance
I can tell Holly what he said.

23:50.200 --> 23:54.400
Maybe now that she's back,
he can see a future with her.

23:54.480 --> 23:58.080
Leaving the house was always
gonna be make or break for us.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.040
He was either gonna
really enjoy his freedom

24:01.120 --> 24:04.880
or he was gonna really miss me
and wanna try and make this work.

24:10.320 --> 24:15.480
Has it made you realise that we're
above all these arguments and stuff?

24:15.560 --> 24:18.120
It's not been right here
without Holly.

24:18.200 --> 24:22.800
It's a massive relief to have her
back and get things back to normal.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.480
My head was fucked.

24:24.560 --> 24:30.080
And, I started to forget, the reason
that, we were fighting for this.

24:30.160 --> 24:33.560
But leaving the house,
I was looking back at old photos.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.400
I was looking back at videos.
And it made us smile so much.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.760
Me and Kyle just needed some space.

24:39.840 --> 24:43.000
I've realised that we do have
something worth fighting for.

24:48.400 --> 24:52.200
I've sorted things out with Holly.
It's a massive weight off me mind.

24:52.280 --> 24:56.040
It's time to get back to the party,
and get fucking mortal.

25:04.360 --> 25:08.440
I feel like I need to talk to Aaron.
I need to sort things out.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.640
When I'm drunk,
I can't control me flirting.

25:21.720 --> 25:25.760
I didn't mean to lead Chloe on. She
just got the wrong end of the stick.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.680
I'm so glad I made up with Aaron.
I've made up with everyone.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.800
Tonight has been wicked.
No arguments,

25:48.880 --> 25:52.240
no tears, and no smashed mirrors.
I can't believe it.

25:53.800 --> 25:54.680
Bye.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.640
See you soon.

25:59.200 --> 26:02.000
I've had an absolutely mint
house party.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.760
It's time to make up for lost time.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.880
(groans)

26:18.840 --> 26:21.280
I'm so happy
I come back for tonight.

26:21.360 --> 26:25.280
I've had such a good fucking night.
(laughs)

26:25.360 --> 26:26.400
(laughs)

26:36.760 --> 26:40.720
I'm pissed. And I've found me way
back to flirting with Aaron.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.880
Fuck, here we go again.

26:48.280 --> 26:52.840
I can't stay away from Marnie.
And she can't stay away from me.

26:52.920 --> 26:56.520
We've had a good night, so we're off
to bed, to have a cuddle.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.760
I've woken up
and I'm so happy to be with Kyle.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.600
I've missed him so much.
I'm glad everything's OK.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.480
Hiya.
You all right?

27:20.560 --> 27:23.880
Uh-huh.
Did you have a good night last night?

27:25.200 --> 27:28.200
It's so nice, waking up
in this house with Holly.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.680
You don't realise how much you'd
miss someone, until they fuck off.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.920
Are we gonna be better now?
Definitely.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.280
Me and you shouldn't be fucking
living with each other this soon.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.800
So it's difficult enough.
Yeah, exactly.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.040
Yeah. But we can make it work.

27:46.120 --> 27:47.120
Yep.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.800
This could be the start of something
really special for me and Kyle.

27:50.880 --> 27:55.120
Sometimes you have to go through shit
to realise how good you've got it.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.560
Marns.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.040
Morning.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.360
What the fuck?
I've woken up in Aaron's bed, again.

28:09.440 --> 28:13.320
There's something still there
between us. I wish I could stay away

28:18.120 --> 28:22.320
I've gotta save face. They always
take the piss about Marnie.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.680
Cuddling her, was a good end,
to a good night.

28:29.760 --> 28:33.640
Last night's house party was wicked.
It was amazing having Lillie there.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.320
I'm even more pleased
there was no kick offs.

28:42.920 --> 28:43.920
Aye, I know.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.480
Are you?
God, it was so bad.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.560
I haven't had a chance to speak
to Charlotte.

28:54.640 --> 28:58.800
We go to the room we haven't spent
much time in and have a catch up.

28:58.880 --> 29:01.360
My head is completely clear.

29:01.440 --> 29:06.440
I left the house, and I honestly
thought it was make or break.

29:08.160 --> 29:12.320
I feel as though like, I've come back
in, he's obviously missed us a lot.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.560
And I feel a lot more confident
in the relationship.

29:15.640 --> 29:19.280
Me being out of the house has proved
that we're on the same page.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.880
Same page?!
You're not even on the same book.

29:21.960 --> 29:26.120
You're reading 50 Shades of Grey.
Kyle hasn't even found Wally yet.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.560
I mean, I wouldn't go that far.
I mean, it's still very early days.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.840
I just think, don't fix something
that's not broken.

29:35.920 --> 29:40.440
This is horrible. Holly's buzzing
cos her and Kyle are in a good place

29:40.520 --> 29:43.640
I know he doesn't wanna be
in a relationship with her.

29:43.720 --> 29:46.120
What the fuck do I do?

29:51.840 --> 29:54.200
We're so excited to go out tonight.

29:54.280 --> 29:56.760
It's the first night out
since Holly's been back.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.440
Be a big one. Is there gonna be
any arguments tonight?

30:05.040 --> 30:07.120
Well, let's not speak too soon.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.640
This is so awkward.
Holly seems so happy.

30:16.720 --> 30:21.080
But me and Charlotte both know that
Kyle just isn't in the same place.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.680
Girls!
(girls) Yeah?

30:26.760 --> 30:27.880
Ready?
Yeah!

30:27.960 --> 30:29.760
What time? Come on.

30:29.840 --> 30:33.360
I'm well in the mood for getting
fucked up. I can't wait.

30:38.600 --> 30:42.760
Madame Koo's. It's my first night
back. I'm gonna get fucking mortal.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.560
Get the shots in and start dancing.

30:48.520 --> 30:51.760
For a change, everyone's having
a wicked night, together.

30:51.840 --> 30:55.160
We're enjoying each other's company,
and dancing like fucking idiots.

31:06.720 --> 31:10.840
We needed a kick off, to bring
everyone back close together.

31:19.480 --> 31:24.000
I'm really getting used to everyone.
I feel like I'm part of the family.

31:30.120 --> 31:34.760
I am so happy. We're back on track,
and getting along better than ever.

31:45.520 --> 31:50.200
I just hope me and Holly can go on,
without everyone getting involved.

31:50.280 --> 31:53.800
I'm happy. Holly's happy.
That's all that really matters.

31:57.440 --> 32:01.320
I can't stop thinking about Kyle not
wanting to be in a relationship.

32:01.400 --> 32:04.640
He's all over her.
What the fuck is he playing at?

32:10.520 --> 32:14.720
Last night was the perfect time for
Kyle to ask Holly out. And he didn't

32:14.800 --> 32:16.760
So he's not gonna do it ever.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.320
It's fine for Kyle
to not want to commit.

32:26.400 --> 32:29.880
But he needs to stop stringing
Holly along. That's not fair.

32:37.680 --> 32:41.080
The only way to resolve this is
if Holly gives Kyle an ultimatum.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.320
He's either with her, or he's not.
There's no in between.

32:51.160 --> 32:55.360
We have had a wicked night. But it's
time to get home cos we are fucked.

33:05.440 --> 33:08.000
We get back
and we're all absolutely mortal.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.600
First thing we do,
head to the kitchen.

33:13.240 --> 33:17.280
Donkey! Donkey! Donkey ride!
Donkey ride! Donkey ride!

33:22.200 --> 33:24.200
I need to talk to Holly.

33:24.280 --> 33:27.880
I need to find out what she wants
from this relationship with Kyle.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.600
Because, deep down,
I know she's not happy.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.840
Of course I would. Of course.

33:38.920 --> 33:42.920
But the more people pressure it,
the more he's gonna back away.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.400
Cos at the end of the day,
his fear is commitment.

33:46.480 --> 33:50.120
Charlotte is my best friend. I know
this is coming from a good place.

33:50.200 --> 33:54.480
But this is just more added pressure.
She needs to back the fuck off.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.960
Cos you can't see how things
are going for the next year

33:58.040 --> 33:59.640
and then still not know.

33:59.720 --> 34:04.160
We kind thought, if you give Kyle
an ultimatum, you'd get the answer.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.440
Well, I wouldn't.

34:05.520 --> 34:08.200
You want me, to start this
amazing relationship

34:08.280 --> 34:12.280
that we could potentially have,
on a fucking ultimatum. Are you mad?

34:12.360 --> 34:15.320
Yous care about each other deeply.
Admit that now.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.920
Course, I've said that.
Exactly.

34:22.200 --> 34:25.200
I can't believe Holly's walked out
and slammed the door.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.720
All I'm trying to do
is give her advice.

34:33.680 --> 34:36.080
Irritating. So fucking irritating.

34:36.160 --> 34:38.080
Holly's upset
after talking to Charlotte.

34:38.160 --> 34:41.480
I need to find out
what's happened here like.

34:42.600 --> 34:46.280
Argh! I just can't get my head around
why Charlotte's so angry.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.360
Why tonight? What's going on?

34:50.520 --> 34:53.120
What have I been saying to her?

34:53.200 --> 34:56.040
Why is Charlotte interfering?
She's Holly's best friend.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.120
All she's doing is upsetting her.

34:59.600 --> 35:03.280
I know that Holly likes you
so much. And she wants this.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.680
She's embarrassed
cos you don't want it.

35:07.760 --> 35:12.400
I'm not doing it to cause problems
but because I care about Holly.

35:12.480 --> 35:15.720
What does it take you to have to be
ready to be seeing her?

35:16.920 --> 35:18.120
So how much time?

35:18.200 --> 35:20.600
Are you kidding me, Charlotte?
(talks)

35:20.680 --> 35:24.560
I'm not gonna do it after a night
out when I get back to this house.

35:24.640 --> 35:28.880
It's kicking off next door.
What the fuck is all that about?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.880
The reason you're pissed off-
(shouts)

35:34.520 --> 35:36.720
No!
Gary never made that leap with you.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.640
That's the reason you're pissed off!

35:41.520 --> 35:45.360
Kyle, you fucking prick. This has
nothing to do with me and Gary.

35:45.440 --> 35:50.240
It's my best friend getting messed
about by an emotionless wanker.

35:50.320 --> 35:53.320
You don't give a fucking shit
about her! Fuck off.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.360
Fuck off.
Fucking stupid ****!

35:56.440 --> 35:57.920
I'm burning with rage.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.280
How dare Kyle say that about me?

36:00.360 --> 36:02.720
This isn't finished.
It's not the end.

36:02.800 --> 36:06.640
I'm going after him.
Don't you fucking dare!

36:06.720 --> 36:11.000
Shut up. Slam the door on me!
Shut up. Don't you fucking dare!

36:11.080 --> 36:14.040
Shut up.
What the fuck is going on?

36:14.120 --> 36:18.360
They're screaming. I don't understand
how things have got this bad.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.840
You're a nutcase.
There was no need for that.

36:20.920 --> 36:23.520
There was absolutely no need.
What, the truth?

36:23.600 --> 36:26.400
Me and Holly are happy.
The fucking truth! The truth!

36:26.480 --> 36:30.480
Look at you again. You're shouting
at one of your best mates in here!

36:30.560 --> 36:32.160
Should I tell my best friend?

36:32.240 --> 36:36.240
What were you saying when she wasn't
here? Do you want me to tell her?

36:36.320 --> 36:40.440
What you said when she wasn't
fucking here?(Holly shouts)

36:40.520 --> 36:42.760
Tell me what Charlotte?
Tell me fucking what?

36:46.920 --> 36:47.920
A lot!

36:48.920 --> 36:50.920
And you bring that up now?

36:52.880 --> 36:57.560
Oh, my God! I think Charlotte is
about to tell Holly what Kyle said.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.640
I don't know if I wanna be here
for this.

37:00.720 --> 37:01.720
Now!

37:02.800 --> 37:04.360
Now!

37:04.440 --> 37:07.120
This can't go on any longer.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.200
It's about fucking time
Holly knew the truth.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.440
Go on!

37:14.120 --> 37:18.520
He was standing there saying "I will
never be anything more with Holly

37:18.600 --> 37:22.800
cos I'll never get with someone who
has slept with so many." Bullshit.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.840
Don't you fucking lie!

37:26.720 --> 37:31.080
I'm screaming down, telling Holly
exactly what Kyle has said.

37:31.160 --> 37:35.840
I can see that it's killing her.
And I'm being the one to do it.

37:35.920 --> 37:40.680
He went, "I'll never marry her. She
will never be the mother of me kids"

37:40.760 --> 37:45.520
Me and Marnie were like, "Don't
fucking speak about her like that."

37:45.600 --> 37:49.320
Why is this happening?
I can't control what I've done.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.880
I'm not that person.

37:50.960 --> 37:54.400
We were happy, but again
you kicked off. Were you, Kyle?!

37:54.480 --> 37:56.680
That's not what you said
when she wasn't here.

37:56.760 --> 38:00.440
You said that you didn't ever
see yourself marrying her.

38:00.520 --> 38:04.120
It's not what you say about someone
you wanna be with for a long time.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.200
Well done. Can I tell you something?
Well fucking done.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.600
Well done.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.520
The fact that Kyle
said he doesn't see a future

38:11.600 --> 38:15.120
and that he could never see himself
marrying anybody like me,

38:15.200 --> 38:18.040
because of the past,
just makes me feel sick.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.680
(sobs)
Hols.

38:20.760 --> 38:21.960
Hol.

38:22.040 --> 38:26.320
Please, please stop it. I didn't-
Why didn't you fucking tell us?

38:26.400 --> 38:28.000
WHY?! WHY?!

38:28.080 --> 38:31.480
Holly, it happened yesterday.
Holly, it literally-Fuck off!

38:35.680 --> 38:38.080
I'm angry at Charlotte.

38:38.160 --> 38:41.000
She knew he'd said those things
behind my back.

38:41.080 --> 38:44.560
And yet she still pushed for us
to be together. Why?

38:54.520 --> 38:59.240
I hate how angry, and how upset
Holly is. I feel like it's my fault.

38:59.320 --> 39:04.000
And I hate how angry she is towards
me cos I didn't wanna cause this.

39:04.080 --> 39:07.480
I didn't want it to be me
who's made her this upset.

39:07.560 --> 39:12.080
I felt like she had to know.
She deserved to know the truth.

39:17.560 --> 39:18.960
(sobs)

39:19.040 --> 39:21.160
I came back into this house,

39:21.240 --> 39:25.000
thinking that me and Kyle were gonna
be able to make things work.

39:25.080 --> 39:29.880
Behind me back, he was saying all the
things I never dreamt I would hear.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.400
And I'm absolutely gutted.

39:36.440 --> 39:37.440
What?

39:40.960 --> 39:42.040
Kyle!

39:42.120 --> 39:43.720
What are you doing?

39:49.920 --> 39:53.240
I wanna know what you said.
I wanna know what you said.

39:53.320 --> 39:57.000
I need to explain myself.
But I'm too pissed and too angry.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.960
I need to get out this house.

40:01.120 --> 40:03.880
Oh, my God!
So I'm not worth fighting for then?

40:03.960 --> 40:06.440
Please! (cries)

40:08.120 --> 40:10.520
(screams, cries)

40:10.600 --> 40:14.800
All I need is for Kyle to tell me the
truth. And I'm begging him to stay.

40:14.880 --> 40:19.880
He's not trying to explain himself.
I'm obviously not worth fighting for.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.680
(sobbing)

40:37.520 --> 40:42.640
I hate seeing me best friend run
around after someone who blatantly

40:42.720 --> 40:44.120
doesn't give a shit.

40:44.200 --> 40:48.680
I hate seeing her so heartbroken,
and cry from the bottom of her heart

40:48.760 --> 40:51.240
about someone
who isn't worth her tears.

40:51.320 --> 40:53.320
(sobs) Please don't leave.

40:53.400 --> 40:56.400
I've got to, man. I've got to.
I've got to, I've got to.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.200
(cries)

40:58.280 --> 41:02.880
I am in the worst state I have ever
been in, in my entire life.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.800
And all I need is a cuddle.
And he just leaves me.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.520
(screams)

41:21.520 --> 41:23.720
(cries)

41:26.480 --> 41:29.720
Right now, I feel as though
lost my best friend,

41:29.800 --> 41:33.600
and the person who I wanna be with.
All in one night.

41:33.680 --> 41:37.440
I don't know how we're gonna be able
to come back from this.

41:37.520 --> 41:42.520
(sobs)

42:08.040 --> 42:08.240
.
