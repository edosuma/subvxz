01:46.982 --> 01:49.066
- Fuck!
- Pen!

01:56.450 --> 01:57.909
Come on!

02:06.043 --> 02:07.251
Oh, yeah!

02:38.617 --> 02:40.201
Come on, then, lads!

03:37.968 --> 03:40.094
You all right?
My name's Gary Titchfield,

03:40.178 --> 03:43.180
but everyone's always
called me "Tits".

03:43.265 --> 03:45.933
It's not the best nickname in the
world, but, you know, it's mine.

03:46.018 --> 03:48.394
I like to think I
make it work for me.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.980
The kid next to me is
me best mate, Dodge.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.858
And the rest of the
lads are me group.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.526
We was a gang before we were a band,

03:55.611 --> 03:57.820
and we were a band
before we picked up any instruments.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.196
Know what I mean?

03:59.281 --> 04:02.450
We were Shadow Caster,
and this is our story.

04:02.534 --> 04:03.576
Top one!

04:40.030 --> 04:42.782
Friday, the 25th of May, 1990.

04:43.408 --> 04:48.287
Two days before Ian Brown, John Squire,
Alan "Reni" Wren, and Gary "Mani" Mounfield

04:48.372 --> 04:52.541
would define an era on the chemical
banks of the dirty Mersey.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.378
To us, The Stone Roses
were the most important band

04:55.462 --> 04:57.588
on the face of the planet.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.549
Will you use the fucking stairs!

05:00.634 --> 05:02.969
Get a fucking house. Put some
clothes on, you're already late.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.763
Right, right.
I'm on it, I'm on it. Fuck!

05:06.932 --> 05:09.308
We already knew
that Spike Island was going to be

05:09.393 --> 05:12.812
the most important gig
in the history of the world.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.905
Oi! Stop playing with yourself!

05:25.659 --> 05:27.910
You need to copy that shit out.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.246
What is it?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.581
Chemistry, mate. Double important.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.251
Come on, then. We're gonna be late.

05:37.963 --> 05:41.298
The Stone Roses smacked me
in the dial like a fucking prize fighter.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.466
And even though they looked like

05:42.592 --> 05:45.469
they could have come right off
our estate, the Red Bricks,

05:45.595 --> 05:48.681
there was just something
different about them.

05:49.683 --> 05:53.477
I mean, they were just like everyone
else, except fucking cooler.

05:54.521 --> 05:59.191
We walked like 'em, we talked like 'em,
we felt like 'em, and we thought like 'em.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.610
They had double top hair
and we wanted to be 'em.

06:01.695 --> 06:06.532
Wanted 'em to lift us out of the shit and
the grime and take us to their planet.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.368
No one say fuck-all. Stay cool.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.927
Fuck!

06:27.012 --> 06:29.513
So, what is Manchester?

06:30.307 --> 06:34.477
J B Priestley said that
"Manchester is the home of living causes"

06:34.561 --> 06:39.648
and "What Manchester thinks today,
England thinks tomorrow."

06:40.567 --> 06:43.694
Mind-blowingly brilliant observations,
I'm sure you'll all agree.

06:44.321 --> 06:49.575
However, clearly nowhere near as fascinating
as what's going on outside the window.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.205
What are your thoughts, boys?

06:54.331 --> 06:55.915
No idea who it was, Mr Milligan.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.708
We was nowhere
near the school gym last night.

06:57.834 --> 06:58.834
Really?

06:59.169 --> 07:01.670
Methinks he doth protest too much.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.179
You look nervous, lads.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.348
I can't think why.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.767
I was only talking about
Priestley's Manchester.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.395
It ain't Priestley's Manchester, sir.
It's ours.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.730
Yeah!

07:19.856 --> 07:21.107
It's the cock of the north, man.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.859
Yeah! Top one, nice one!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.444
You're twisting my melon, man!

07:26.404 --> 07:27.988
And in the context
of English Journey?

07:28.073 --> 07:31.033
On any journey, sir. It ain't where
you're from, it's where you're at.

07:31.701 --> 07:32.993
And is that your philosophy?

07:33.078 --> 07:35.955
No, sir. It's a quote.
From somebody relevant.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.706
Yeah, the greatest writer
of this generation.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.625
Really? And who is that?

07:40.377 --> 07:41.585
Just a singer in a band.

07:41.878 --> 07:45.256
Well, may I remind you,
this isn't a music lesson.

07:45.382 --> 07:49.218
This, in case you're unaware,
is English History.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.763
Yeah, and The Stone Roses
are England now, sir.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.932
See, the past is yours,
but the future's mine.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.184
Yeah.

07:57.269 --> 08:01.480
Manchester, la la la!
Manchester, la la la! Manchester, la la la!

08:01.565 --> 08:04.108
Oi! Chuckle Brothers. Sit down.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.153
Sit down!

08:09.406 --> 08:10.614
All right, stop!

08:10.740 --> 08:13.117
Hammer time!

08:13.910 --> 08:17.079
Gary Titchfield and his band
of merry men, please.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.622
Ooh!

08:23.461 --> 08:26.172
Settle down! Settle down!

08:28.800 --> 08:33.429
I have never seen such
mindless, wilful destruction before!

08:35.182 --> 08:36.347
Well?

08:37.308 --> 08:41.102
I can't wait to hear what you've
got to say for yourselves!

08:41.188 --> 08:43.105
Everyone knows you did it.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.024
No, we never.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.402
Someone read that for me.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.112
Shadow Cast-re.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.532
Which, unless I'm much mistaken,
is the name of your pop group.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.118
No. We're Shadow Cast-er.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.661
So, who was it, then?

08:59.164 --> 09:00.206
Fans?

09:00.290 --> 09:03.292
Fans? You haven't got any fans.
You're not The Palaver.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.628
The Palavers are bobbins, sir.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.172
We have got fans.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.132
Classrooms! Fast!

09:12.135 --> 09:13.761
Come on, lads,
I'm not a dickhead.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.723
There's only one bunch
of boys in this school

09:17.807 --> 09:20.559
daft enough to write
their own band name on the wall.

09:20.644 --> 09:24.063
And there's only one young man just
plain stupid enough to spell it wrong.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.732
Dodge ain't stupid, sir.
He's a straight-up musical genius.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.901
And Tits was at the
hospital last night.

09:30.487 --> 09:34.156
Your loyalty to each other
is actually quite admirable.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.327
Your lack of loyalty to this school,
on the other hand, disgusts me.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.331
Do you really want to end up
like your brothers?

09:42.999 --> 09:44.250
Where are they now?

09:44.751 --> 09:45.834
Ibiza.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.169
Having it right off.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.215
Last chance.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.217
No more shenanigans.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.387
Any more nonsense from any
one of you, and, bang, gone!

09:56.721 --> 09:59.348
The lot of you, one out, all out!

09:59.849 --> 10:02.434
Now go!
I'm sick of looking at you!

10:06.856 --> 10:08.357
Gary, not you.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.196
How's your dad doing?

10:15.532 --> 10:18.075
Yeah, he's all right.
Getting better.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.368
Good.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.788
Now, listen, Gary, unlike the
others, you're a bright lad,

10:22.872 --> 10:24.623
so you don't need me to spell
it out for you.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.583
This was criminal damage,

10:27.377 --> 10:29.044
and the only reason
I haven't involved the police

10:29.546 --> 10:32.131
is out of respect for your family.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.008
I know how easy it
is to get led astray

10:34.092 --> 10:36.635
and I know things must be
difficult at home at the moment.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.887
No, you don't, Mr Jackson.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.181
You don't know nish
about me or me mates.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.726
Or my family. So just leave it.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.153
For fuck's sake, boys!
Wait up!

10:54.237 --> 10:56.113
- What did Wacko Jacko want?
- Nowt. It's right.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.948
I can't believe
we just fucking got away with that.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.242
I can't believe I've got to rely
on you tools not to get expelled.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.745
Fuck that. I still can't believe we
haven't got our tickets for Sunday.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.871
We should've just bought 'em.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.290
With what? Oh, aye, I forgot.
Your mum had a result on the pools.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.416
Did she?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.668
- Did she fuck. It's your mam.
- Look, it'll be right.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.003
Yeah, right.
You keep saying that.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.296
Because it will. Trust me.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.340
I do.
It's Keith Teeth that's the problem.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.591
The guy's a pure tube.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.135
I don't reckon he could get us tickets
for the one-three-five, man.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.304
He could, however, eat an apple
through a tennis racquet.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.015
He's got 'em, right?
Swore on his mum's life.

11:23.099 --> 11:26.977
See? Listen to Tits. He knows everything.
Anyway, he's fucking all right, Keith Teeth.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.103
He's fucking all wrong.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.981
Zippy, look me in the eyes, man.
When have I ever let you down?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.984
Oi! I said look me in the eyes.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.361
Sally Harris.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.904
Oh! Lisa Hughes!

11:36.988 --> 11:38.614
Fuck's sake,
nobody jizz their pants.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.206
Yeah, let's do it.
Get in there, man.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.166
- Upstairs, man, sharpish!
- We fucking are!

11:51.211 --> 11:52.795
Oh, shit!

11:56.841 --> 11:57.966
Where'd you get them?

11:58.051 --> 12:00.260
Piccadilly Records. What about you?

12:00.345 --> 12:02.554
I bet yous haven't
even got tickets.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.681
We'll be backstage. VIPs.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.643
How come? Is your brother back
or something, Tits?

12:07.727 --> 12:08.227
No.

12:08.253 --> 12:10.254
It's where they lob all
the acid casualties.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.314
No. It's where the cool
kids get sucked off.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.608
- Oh.
- You're jibbin' it, aren't you?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.110
You little scally twats.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.319
No, we're getting 'em tomorrow.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.531
Serious?
You lot are paying for something?

12:20.657 --> 12:22.533
- Where you getting them?
- Keith Teeth.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.451
Keith Teeth?

12:24.536 --> 12:25.994
Yeah, right. Like that'll happen.

12:26.538 --> 12:30.332
Keith Teeth's a mong. It's been
sold out for time. You're goosed.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.002
- How's your dad?
- Yeah. He's not bad.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.754
Buzzing.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.552
Little Gaz,
is it true you're selling weed?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.429
- What're you after?
- Fivers. Can you change that?

12:43.513 --> 12:44.930
Yeah. I can change it
into a bigger lump of draw.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.974
- Oh, come on!
- I've got no change.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.600
For fuck's sake, go on.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.561
Greetings, Earthlings.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.397
What time's praccy tonight?
Are we recording?

12:53.523 --> 12:54.565
Recording what?

12:54.899 --> 12:57.359
- Demo.
- What of? How to be spackers?

12:57.527 --> 12:58.610
Demo tape.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.279
- Is it any good?
- Of course!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.030
We're the second best
band in the world.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.240
No one's heard it.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.076
Dodge has been a proper tape Nazi.
He won't play it to no one.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.453
Yeah, he will.
When it's finished.

13:07.537 --> 13:08.662
And when it is, it'll be smart.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.539
You should take it to Spike Island,
give it to the Roses.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.791
When you're backstage.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.253
Laters.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.384
<i>♪ Until Sally I was never happy</i>

13:22.469 --> 13:24.553
<i>♪ I needed so much more</i>

13:24.637 --> 13:28.432
<i>♪ Rain clouds, oh,
they used to chase me</i>

13:28.892 --> 13:30.893
<i>♪ Down they would pour</i>

13:31.978 --> 13:35.314
<i>♪ Sent to me from heaven</i>

13:35.732 --> 13:40.068
<i>♪ Sally Cinnamon, you're my world ♪</i>

13:55.585 --> 13:58.003
You do know you're never going
to bang Sally, don't you, Dodge?

13:58.087 --> 14:00.297
He'd have to talk to her first,
or at least finger her.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.925
Oh, you don't know what you're talking
about. None of you understand.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.010
I do!
Get her juiced up and that.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.762
Oi, don't be snide. Leave him alone.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.848
It's different with Sally.
She makes me feel like...

14:09.933 --> 14:11.391
She makes me feel
like writing tunes.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.268
That is the gayest
thing I've ever heard.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.895
She makes me feel like bumming her.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.231
No, wait. That's the gayest
thing I've ever heard.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.150
- See you in a bit, boys.
- See you later.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.277
Oi, it's not that bad
of an idea, you know.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.238
- What ain't?
- What Sally said.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.949
If we get on it now and we record
praccy tonight and tomoz,

14:27.033 --> 14:29.701
we can get the tape finished for Sunday,
take it to Spike Island.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.371
Yeah. No point in always
banging on about summat

14:32.455 --> 14:35.082
if you're never going to do
fuck-all about it, is there?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.500
We are gonna get in, aren't we?

14:36.626 --> 14:38.126
Yeah, of course.
It'll be right.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.045
Wish your Ste was here.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.631
Yeah, well, he's not.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.727
What's up with you?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.938
It's too fast and choppy and there's
not really a proper melody to it.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.273
Sounds like The fucking Fall.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.608
It's not that bad.

15:42.692 --> 15:43.942
It's not perfect.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.445
We ain't got time to dick about.
It don't matter.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.905
Of course it fucking matters.
It's the only thing that does matter.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.867
I've got to get off.

15:52.744 --> 15:53.994
Part-timer.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.579
What?

15:57.081 --> 16:00.709
Nowt. I'll have it bang off
by the time you get back, right.

17:00.478 --> 17:01.728
Fuck! Jesus wept.

17:02.772 --> 17:06.566
I sound like that bloody Vauxhall Viva
that we had to leave in Aberystwyth.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.779
It's not right, you know, the two of
you laughing like this. You're sick.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.571
It's not bloody funny.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.950
No. No, it's not.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.993
And I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.288
Well, maybe Maggie Thatcher.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.835
- So, how're you feeling?
-  Oh.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.963
Like I've swallowed a blow torch
and it's stuck here.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.465
Well, you look better.

17:34.345 --> 17:37.389
Take us to the TV room, will you, son?
I'm dying for a fag.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.807
- He'll meet you there.
- Oh, come on.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.685
He'll... He'll meet you there.

17:47.942 --> 17:51.695
You won't remember this,
but he used to sing to you.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.489
Ewan MacColl, Father's Song.

17:55.158 --> 17:58.452
Big filthy hands all over you, just
after I'd bathed you in the sink.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.663
He was tone bloody deaf.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.373
Mum.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.501
Is Dad... Is he... Is he all right?

18:08.838 --> 18:10.839
He's very poorly, Gary.

18:12.675 --> 18:16.845
Things need to be talked about.
You know, with you and the stall.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.308
When he's, um...

18:23.352 --> 18:26.855
He's been working out
how to tell you this for weeks.

18:35.531 --> 18:39.117
Excitement is building across
the country, with only two days to go

18:39.202 --> 18:43.413
before Manchester band, The Stone Roses,
take to the stage at Spike Island

18:43.539 --> 18:47.584
in what promises to be
the most important gig of their careers.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.462
How big do you think
The Stone Roses will get?

18:50.546 --> 18:52.839
I think we could be the
biggest band ever.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.883
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.055
The event will take place
in the industrial town of Widnes,

19:00.181 --> 19:02.849
where preparations
are already well underway.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.018
The concert sold out
over a month ago,

19:05.102 --> 19:07.729
- and tickets are now like gold dust.
- Mum, do you want owt?

19:07.855 --> 19:09.356
It's already being touted

19:09.440 --> 19:12.359
as a Woodstock
for the Manchester generation.

19:16.239 --> 19:19.616
Eat it quick. If Godzuki wakes
up, she'll have it away.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.536
Over 30,000 fans
are expected to convene

19:22.620 --> 19:26.498
on the banks of the Mersey this Sunday
at the gig's controversial venue,

19:26.582 --> 19:29.751
an unlikely spot in the shadow
of a chemical and power plant.

19:29.877 --> 19:33.255
Police are warning fans without
tickets to stay away from the event,

19:33.381 --> 19:37.300
promising to deal forcibly with any
attempts to gain entry illegally.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.595
The group provoked more controversy
earlier this year

19:40.721 --> 19:43.849
after a fierce dispute
with their old record-label boss,

19:43.933 --> 19:47.477
who accuses the band
of attacking him with paint.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.063
Don't want to
talk about it any more.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.481
It's just one day out.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.609
Common criminals.
And you want to be like them?

19:54.902 --> 19:56.778
I did what you wanted.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.281
- I signed the forms.
- Good.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.033
Army's best place for you.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.327
Or do you think you're
better than me?

20:04.453 --> 20:05.745
Please.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.291
Don't make me get upset.

20:12.795 --> 20:17.757
If anyone hadda told me at your age
that I was gonna be a florist,

20:18.467 --> 20:19.759
I'd have had their bumps felt.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.804
But it's a job.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.098
And you'd learn to love flowers.

20:26.851 --> 20:30.145
And your Uncle Hairy. Eventually.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.315
Do I get to choose?

20:34.317 --> 20:35.984
About the stall?

20:36.819 --> 20:37.986
Yeah.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.113
Of course.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.116
You've always got a choice, lad.

20:44.118 --> 20:47.621
I can't force you to do anything
that you don't want to do.

20:47.705 --> 20:51.499
And don't ever let anyone tell you
that they can. Ever.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.712
Then I can't do it, Dad.

20:56.797 --> 21:00.008
I want to be someone,
make summat of my life.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.573
- All right, Tits?
- All right, Jay?

21:30.706 --> 21:33.083
- All right?
- Yeah, yeah, sorted.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.044
- What do this team of remmies want?
- Just having a listen and that.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.462
Who cut your fringe? Mr Magoo?

21:37.755 --> 21:38.880
No. Me mam.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.216
And what the fuck are them kicks?

21:41.550 --> 21:42.884
Adidas four-stripe?

21:42.969 --> 21:44.719
Whatever they are, get
them off our path. Fast.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.933
- You all right, Voodoo Ray?
- All right, boys?

21:50.059 --> 21:51.685
<i>♪ Voodoo, Voodoo Ray, Ray</i>

21:51.769 --> 21:53.269

21:57.817 --> 21:59.234
How's your kid, Tits?

21:59.318 --> 22:00.986
What? Yeah. Sound. Still in Ibiza.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.196
No, he's on the Red Bricks.
Drove past him teatime.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.447
He was going in the Dark Side.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.408
Going to bounce on down there now.
In a bit, yeah?

22:06.492 --> 22:08.410
- In a bit.
- Sweet, that's our tickets sorted.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.662
- Yeah, what about the tape?
- What about you stop being gay?

22:10.746 --> 22:13.164
Come on, then, bum chums.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.251
What's he done to you this time?
You all right?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.169
Yeah. Are you?

22:19.088 --> 22:20.130
Yeah.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.301
- He's a dick.
- He's my dad.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.804
And you want to be just like him?

22:27.930 --> 22:29.264
It's done.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.099
I'm going.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.101
Don't tell the others.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.478
Are you two fucking getting off
with each other over there, or what?

22:36.272 --> 22:37.439
Someone buy us a drink?

23:01.464 --> 23:02.547
'Ey-up, Skids!

23:06.052 --> 23:09.220
- All right, Ste?
- Look at you, man! Come here.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.057
- You all right?
- Yeah, man, I'm good.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.858
Look at you, all fucking grown up.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.526
What're you drinking, Baby Bio?

23:24.070 --> 23:26.946
- When did you get back?
- Landed about half two.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.532
Here y'are, budgie boy.
Best little fellas in Europe, these.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.242
What about me mum and dad?

23:31.327 --> 23:32.952
I'll sort 'em out with a pill each
when I see 'em next.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.537
What are you on
about, you ball bag?

23:34.663 --> 23:37.165
I mean, have you been
to the hospital?

23:37.875 --> 23:40.543
No, not yet. Visiting hours
are over now, aren't they?

23:41.420 --> 23:42.504
I'll go up there tomorrow.

23:47.176 --> 23:48.927
He's not good, Ste.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.553
Really not good.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.349
Has Mum rung you?

23:54.683 --> 23:55.767
Couple of weeks ago.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.435
Is that why you're back?

23:58.521 --> 23:59.604
And to see you.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.774
And the Roses, man.
D'you think I'd miss that?

24:02.858 --> 24:05.193
No, of course not.
You got a ticket?

24:05.694 --> 24:07.237
Have I, bollocks.
Guest-listed up to fuck, aren't I?

24:08.030 --> 24:10.740
What about yous? Do you need me
to sort out a jib or are you right?

24:10.866 --> 24:14.702
No, we're right.
Getting 'em tomoz, off Keith Teeth.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.580
- Keith Teeth?
- Yeah. What?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.208
No, he's all right, Keith Teeth.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.585
Set of Newtons like a fucked fence,
but he's a good lad.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.091
'Ere y'are.
Show 'em what you can do.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.759
I'll play you a little
bit of intro, yeah?

24:29.885 --> 24:31.386
Top one, bro.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.309
What's this, amateur night?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.478
No, I was fucking playing that,
Dave Famous!

24:40.604 --> 24:42.438
You can have it back
when you've been signed.

24:42.565 --> 24:43.606
Like we just have.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.154
Hey, Dave!

24:50.573 --> 24:52.991
What a massive bell-end!

25:02.001 --> 25:03.751
Listen, our kid.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.964
I know things have been a proper
nightmare for you, but I'm here now.

25:08.090 --> 25:11.009
So I don't want you
to worry about fuck-all, right?

25:12.178 --> 25:13.219
Here y'are.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.930
Right, you
pricks, shut up and dance!

25:16.015 --> 25:17.348
Now let's go bananas.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.200
What's up with you?

25:36.285 --> 25:37.368
Guess who's just got a record deal?

25:38.954 --> 25:39.954
Are you taking the piss?

25:42.666 --> 25:43.708
Who are these cunts?

25:43.959 --> 25:45.627
- The Palaver.
- They're all right, aren't they?

25:46.629 --> 25:48.963
No! Fucking placcy Manc band!

25:49.465 --> 25:50.882
Guitarist only knows three chords.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.508
Basic ones. No barre chords.

25:52.635 --> 25:55.345
Every tune has the same progression.
He couldn't pick his fucking nose.

25:55.638 --> 25:58.306
Right. Do you want a pill?

26:00.893 --> 26:01.976
Yeah.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.153
- Now then, Nimrod.
- Hi, there.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.572
- What news from the continent?
- Sound, mate. Sound.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.569
Here, don't stop.
I nearly had it then.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.821
It's like an hour-old mouse.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.534
Just give us a minute,
will you, lad?

28:23.952 --> 28:27.121
Ah, no. Fuck's sake.
It's gone. It's gone.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.291
Nice one, Tits.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.294
Right, you'd better get dressed.
I've got to go to work.

28:49.478 --> 28:50.645
Are you as fucked as I am?

28:53.023 --> 28:55.900
You do know that tomorrow's massive,
don't you, eh?

28:55.984 --> 28:58.736
It's history in the making, innit?
I've had a pathetic vision.

28:58.821 --> 29:00.947
- So are you going?
- 'Course I fucking am.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.532
I was dragged up on punk, son.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.368
It's not punk! It's baggy.
Scallydelia.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.370
Right, for a start,
are you a backward?

29:07.496 --> 29:10.331
Them are made-up words.
I'm talking about attitude.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.375
Ian Brown is John Lydon times 10.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.544
- Have you got a ticket?
- Have I, bollocks!

29:15.838 --> 29:16.879
You been up the hozzie?

29:20.509 --> 29:24.095
Not fair, is it?
Your dad's a shining diamond, man.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.472
And I know I can still be
a bit of a mither and all that,

29:26.557 --> 29:28.266
but I'll work hard for you.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.393
No, you won't.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.061
I'll give it a fucking good go.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.021
No, I mean you won't
be working for me.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.714
Fuck!

30:00.966 --> 30:02.091
Keith Teeth! The tickets!

30:18.066 --> 30:22.069
Five lighters. Five lighters.
Five for a quid. Five for a quid.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.580
All right? Gary?

30:33.415 --> 30:35.791
Aye, aye! We're on. I'll do one.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.418
Where you going?

30:44.009 --> 30:45.051
"Gary"?

30:45.135 --> 30:49.180
I just think "Tits" doesn't sound
all that...sophisticated.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.807
It's not the best nickname in the world,
but, you know, it is mine.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.893
Like to think I make
it work for me.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.479
Anyway, "Gary"
just sounds weird now.

30:57.814 --> 30:58.856
Are you with your mam?

30:58.941 --> 31:01.692
Yeah, she's just looking
at stuff over there.

31:02.653 --> 31:03.778
Top one.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.167
Might as well have some flowers,
seeing as I'm here and all that.

31:18.293 --> 31:19.293
Who are they for?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.045
Wouldn't you like to know?

31:21.797 --> 31:23.256
I'll chuck in a few good ones.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.966
- Lovely.
- It will be.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.720
Have you got your tickets yet?

31:30.472 --> 31:31.722
What time is it?

31:31.807 --> 31:33.683
It's just gone 3:00.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.644
Should be meeting Keith Teeth now.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.564
It'll be right.
He's all right, Keith Teeth.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.236
It suits you, you know,
the whole market-trader vibe.

31:46.029 --> 31:49.991
What, like St Eric of Salford?
Think that's all I want to be, me dad?

31:51.410 --> 31:52.493
Soz.

31:52.578 --> 31:56.163
No, I should, erm, probably head off.
What do I owe you for the flowers?

31:57.165 --> 31:59.500
Nish.
You can have 'em for fuck-all.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.919
Just don't ever let anyone tell you
I'm a tight-arse.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.838
I'd never hear a bad word said.

32:22.024 --> 32:23.065
Here y'are!

32:39.207 --> 32:41.459
- All right, girls?
- All right, lads?

32:41.543 --> 32:42.627
Seen Keith Teeth?

32:42.711 --> 32:43.836
No, soz.

32:43.920 --> 32:48.299
What, he's not let you down, has he?
No way, didn't see that coming.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.550
Spike Island outfit.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.765
Do you want to buy any sunglasses?

32:55.891 --> 32:57.391
Do you want to buy
any squidgy black?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.101
Have you heard about the trains?

32:59.227 --> 33:01.896
I think so. Are they the big, noisy
things that run along tracks?

33:01.980 --> 33:04.774
You can't get into the station or
through the turnstiles to the platforms

33:04.900 --> 33:06.400
without a ticket for the gig.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.070
Security are going to be checking
'em on Station Approach.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.906
And they're closing the roads
four square mile of Widnes.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.450
You can't even get on to the site
without crossing the Mersey.

33:14.576 --> 33:15.910
Only way in is on the
official coaches.

33:17.079 --> 33:18.746
You lot look caned to fuck.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.748
We got pilled up last
night in the Dark Side.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.625
With Ibiza Ste and
all the older heads.

33:23.085 --> 33:25.127
- It was banging.
- I'd give you a proper banging.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.463
So, what?
Is Ibiza Ste back, then?

33:27.589 --> 33:28.673
Yeah.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.591
- Is he going to Spike Island?
- Yeah.

33:31.927 --> 33:33.260
Are all the big boys going?

33:33.512 --> 33:35.346
Yeah. And we're going with them.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.431
Fuck me, it speaks!

33:38.767 --> 33:41.519
So, are you going to find me
in Widnes then, or what?

33:42.979 --> 33:44.438
Yeah, all right, yeah.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.733
When you get inside,
find the sound desk.

33:47.818 --> 33:49.944
Be on the left hand
side, facing the stage.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.279
- Right...
- No, left.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.534
Be there by 7:00, yeah?

33:56.618 --> 33:57.660
Yeah.

33:59.329 --> 34:00.454
N ice one.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.374
I mean, I'll be with Dodge
and that lot, so...

34:03.458 --> 34:05.793
Yeah, I know. 'Course you will.
And I'll be with the girls.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.755
- Is Sally not about?
- No.

34:10.841 --> 34:12.049
Is she still going tomorrow, though?

34:12.134 --> 34:13.926
Yeah, of course. What about Tits?

34:14.010 --> 34:15.136
Yeah. Of course.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.344
Sound.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.097
So, we should meet up or summat?

34:18.181 --> 34:19.389
You fucking know that, sugar tits?

34:20.308 --> 34:21.391
"Sugar tits"?

34:22.728 --> 34:23.978
How will you find us?

34:24.062 --> 34:26.313
You'll find us. We'll stand out.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.440
Mega.

34:27.524 --> 34:29.400
- Be at the main gate.
- Buzzing.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.650
Oh, look, there's Keith Teeth.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.487
Quality! You actually think
he's coming, don't you?

34:34.572 --> 34:36.449
Yeah, he said he swore
on his mum's life and all that.

34:36.533 --> 34:37.616
H is mam's dead.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.034
Why didn't Tits just get
Ste to sort you out?

34:39.161 --> 34:40.494
- Hey!
- Quick!

34:40.579 --> 34:42.496
- Come here!
- Come on!

34:46.333 --> 34:49.170
Right, I'll see you,
Gary Titchfield.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.172
See you, Sally Cinnamon.

34:53.175 --> 34:54.425
You do know that's a love song?

34:55.092 --> 34:57.094
Yeah. But about a lesbian.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.388
Yeah.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.354
- You fucking naused that right up.
- What?

35:07.856 --> 35:09.690
She's bang into you. And she's fit.

35:09.858 --> 35:10.900
No, she ain't.

35:11.026 --> 35:14.028
Yeah, she is. All right, ladies?

35:14.404 --> 35:16.113
Been to see Dad yet?

35:16.198 --> 35:17.239
I'm on me way up there now.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.242
I just need a word with Hairy
Bollocks about a few things first.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.786
Yeah, sound.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.970
Keith Teeth ain't coming, is he?

35:45.435 --> 35:47.394
I told you Keith Teeth was a knob.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.772
- Fuck!
- Yeah. Fuck. Goofy prick.

35:50.899 --> 35:54.318
Listen, go back to the Red Bricks, right?
See if you can find the cunt.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.779
I'll bell our Ste, see if he can
sort summat. It'll be right.

36:03.245 --> 36:06.413
Ste? It's me.
You're probably in the hospital.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.415
Listen...

36:09.125 --> 36:12.294
Keith Teeth's let us down, mate.
We're fucked.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.129
I've never asked you for owt before,

36:14.256 --> 36:17.216
but you asked me if we needed an in
and, well, we do now,

36:17.300 --> 36:19.844
so, I don't know,
just come and see me at the stall

36:19.928 --> 36:21.637
or just stick your head
in the garage later or summat.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.430
Fuck!

36:23.682 --> 36:25.266
Shit! Mate, the pips have gone.
I hope me dad's...

36:29.145 --> 36:32.439
Gates, fences, dibble,
security guards.

36:33.149 --> 36:36.986
Fucking rivers that soppy Scousers
sing soppy songs about.

36:37.279 --> 36:41.115
None of who are going to stop us
from getting in. Nothing is.

36:41.283 --> 36:45.911
We blag, we lie, we climb,
we rush the barrier, we fucking swim.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.454
All we got to do is make sure

36:47.539 --> 36:50.374
that we get inside somewhere
we ain't supposed to be.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.709
When's that ever been
a problem for us?

36:51.835 --> 36:54.169
Christmas Eve.
When Zippy fingered that 12-year-old.

36:54.296 --> 36:55.296
She was 14.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.172
Yeah, 14 times too fucking young
to be fingered.

36:57.299 --> 36:59.341
- Do you think it'll come to that?
- What, fingering 12-year-olds?

36:59.467 --> 37:02.344
No, I don't. I think our Ste
will come through with tickets.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.637
Or put our names on the gate.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.306
So it'll be right, Tits, yeah?

37:05.390 --> 37:07.892
We've got to go to the gate anyway
to meet the girls for our date.

37:08.018 --> 37:09.143
- He hasn't got a date.
- I have.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.394
- Who with?
- Me and Dodge.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.562
Pardon?

37:11.646 --> 37:13.230
We've got a double date
with Lisa and Sally.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.357
- Sally Harris?
- Yeah.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.318
- Since when?
- Since this afternoon.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.737
We've seen Rachel Stone
and Lisa Hughes in Afflecks.

37:19.821 --> 37:22.364
We said we'd meet them
at the gate. With Sally.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.451
No, it's just... Sally said she was
going to be at the sound desk at 7:00.

37:25.535 --> 37:26.994
Left-hand side, facing the stage.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.203
When did she say that?

37:28.330 --> 37:29.997
Today. At the stall.

37:30.332 --> 37:31.332
- She come to see you?
- Yeah.

37:31.416 --> 37:35.002
Well, no. She was shopping with her mam.
We arranged to meet up.

37:35.337 --> 37:38.839
All of us. Don't have to.
Just thought you'd be into it.

37:41.176 --> 37:43.260
Tit-ular, you're a fucking genius!

37:43.511 --> 37:46.472
Quality! He properly thinks
he might get off with her.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.265
I'm definitely gonna
finger someone.

37:48.350 --> 37:51.435
You know what? I'm not all that fucking
arsed even if I got to settle for Rachel.

37:51.519 --> 37:54.647
Here y'are, Dodge, you could always play
her one of your 85 fucking love songs.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.857
Every new tune he's working on,
he's written for her.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.275
I think Rachel's lovely.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.195
For fuck's sake, boys, let's not lose
focus at the first sight of fanny.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.238
The most important thing
is seeing the band.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.032
And trying to give them the demo.

38:05.367 --> 38:08.035
Just one last take each to box me
and Tits off on Ten Mile Smile, yeah?

38:08.286 --> 38:10.412
You know what, can we just play
it together then, for once?

38:10.538 --> 38:12.122
I'm forgetting what it's like
to actually be in a band.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.248
Yeah, but we need to do...

38:13.375 --> 38:16.293
Mate, the Roses recorded Resurrection
in one take, for fuck's sake.

38:16.378 --> 38:17.544
Come on!

38:18.046 --> 38:20.047
Oh, another tune
about Sally Harris.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.509
- No, it ain't.
- "Ten Mile Smile"? It's obvious!

38:23.593 --> 38:25.469
It's not. Tits wrote these lyrics.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.226
One, two...

38:32.644 --> 38:34.061
Hearing this? One, two.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.652
Hello? Fucking hell.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.154
I don't do requests.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.573
One, two, three, four.

39:14.519 --> 39:19.606
<i>♪ Sending me some distant place</i>

39:21.609 --> 39:25.821

40:57.080 --> 41:00.707
Fucking check us out.
Top bricks on the chimney.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.876
Ten mile high on Ten
Mile Smile there.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.338
It was one of them pure moments,
you know what I mean?

41:06.422 --> 41:09.049
It felt like me and me four mates
could take on the world

41:09.134 --> 41:12.386
in a straight one-on-one fist fight
and spark it out.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.060
<i>♪ Got a ten-mile smile</i>

41:20.812 --> 41:27.067
<i>♪ A ten-mile smile</i>

41:27.986 --> 41:30.279
<i>♪ A ten-mile smile ♪</i>

41:39.747 --> 41:41.748
Shit!  Soz.

41:46.963 --> 41:48.672
Fuck me, that was special!

41:48.756 --> 41:51.466
Play the fucker back, then!
All of it! The whole demo!

41:52.677 --> 41:53.760
Whoo!

41:55.471 --> 41:56.680
That was fucking ace, man!

41:56.848 --> 41:58.265
Sounds like a real band!

41:58.349 --> 41:59.516
Zips, we are a real band.

41:59.601 --> 42:01.602
Got to tell you, Penfold, mate,
you sound fucking sorted on it.

42:01.686 --> 42:03.395
What are you talking about?
You can't even hear me!

42:03.479 --> 42:05.480
- Bingo!
- It's not perfect, though.

42:05.607 --> 42:06.607
Yeah, it is.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.650
See! Nice one, lads.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.277
What the fuck do these
two know, anyway?

42:10.612 --> 42:12.279
We know that you're the best band
on the Red Bricks.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.198
- What about The Palaver?
- Don't rate 'em.

42:14.574 --> 42:16.241
They think they're the Mondays,
but they're wank.

42:16.326 --> 42:17.451
Tell 'em what we call 'em, Jay.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.869
The Baggy Undies.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.704
Anyway, what kind of name
is The Palaver?

42:21.122 --> 42:22.998
Who names a group after
a fruit meringue?

42:23.082 --> 42:26.001
The guitarist's shit and all.
He only knows three chords.

42:27.337 --> 42:28.795
Right then, we're
taking it with us.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.505
Do you seriously think
we can give it to the Roses?

42:30.590 --> 42:32.174
I seriously think we can try, yeah.

42:32.258 --> 42:33.508
Where is Spike Island, anyway?

42:33.593 --> 42:34.843
It's near Widnes, innit?

42:34.928 --> 42:36.345
- Where's that?
- Near Liverpool, innit?

42:36.930 --> 42:39.014
- Where's that?
- About 30-odd miles up the East Lancs Road.

42:39.098 --> 42:40.140
Where's the East Lancs Road?

42:40.225 --> 42:42.643
Right, this could easily go on all night.
How are we gonna get there?

42:42.727 --> 42:43.936
- I could drive.
- Drive what?

42:44.020 --> 42:46.021
Herd of cattle.
A fucking car, you bell-end.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.066
I've got a better idea.
Follow me.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.488
- I'm not driving that.
- Yeah, you are.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.616
It's perfect.
It's so cognito, it's incognito.

42:57.700 --> 42:58.951
It's what?

42:59.035 --> 43:00.994
Gary! Look sharp!

43:07.418 --> 43:09.002
What's up, Mum?

43:09.254 --> 43:10.420
The hospital.

43:10.505 --> 43:11.546
At this time?

43:11.631 --> 43:13.548
- Come with me, he'll want you.
- But, Mum...

43:14.968 --> 43:16.176
Is Ste there?

43:16.261 --> 43:17.803
- Our Steven?
- Yeah.

43:17.887 --> 43:19.137
No, of course not. Why?

43:21.849 --> 43:23.850
Didn't even know he
was in the country.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.769
He got back yesterday.

43:25.853 --> 43:26.895
Where is he now?

43:27.313 --> 43:28.355
Don't know.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.649
Find him and bring him to me.
I want you both close.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.234
For how long?

43:32.443 --> 43:33.568
What do you mean, "for how long"?

43:33.653 --> 43:35.487
It's just, you know, Spike Island!

43:36.072 --> 43:38.073
What, the Guns N' Roses concert?
No, you can't go!

43:38.157 --> 43:39.700
- But I've been waiting months to go...
- Things change!

43:39.784 --> 43:43.412
- But you said I could go!
- It don't matter what I said!

43:46.291 --> 43:47.958
That was before.

43:48.293 --> 43:49.710
Before what?

43:52.130 --> 43:54.047
Just find your brother.

43:54.132 --> 43:55.299
Soon!

44:07.395 --> 44:08.770
All right, Tits?

44:08.855 --> 44:10.605
All right, Carlos?

44:11.065 --> 44:12.149
What the fuck, Ste?

44:13.735 --> 44:14.776
What?

44:15.111 --> 44:17.237
I got your message. I'm on it.

44:17.697 --> 44:18.864
I was coming to see you.

44:19.532 --> 44:21.616
- What about me dad?
- Yeah, I know.

44:21.701 --> 44:23.243
It's just, I've been running round
like a dick all day

44:23.328 --> 44:24.578
trying to sort you a guest list out.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.581
Anyway, I think I've boxed it off.
Worst comes to worst,

44:27.665 --> 44:30.959
I'll just word up security when
I get there. But you're deffo in.

44:35.798 --> 44:38.175
What're you fucking staring at?

44:40.845 --> 44:41.887
Over here.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.814
I can't do it. All right?

44:54.400 --> 44:56.234
Fucking hospitals and that.

44:56.319 --> 44:59.196
I can't see him like that, Tits.
It's too hard, mate.

44:59.364 --> 45:01.698
What, you think it's easy for me?

45:01.783 --> 45:03.658
Going up there every day,
watching it eat him?

45:04.994 --> 45:07.037
It's not, mate.
It's the hardest thing in the world.

45:08.581 --> 45:11.208
But you need to get down there now.

45:12.627 --> 45:13.835
Right.

45:16.881 --> 45:18.382
How long are you staying, Ste?

45:18.966 --> 45:20.342
I'll just bang this pint down.

45:20.551 --> 45:23.387
No, I mean in Manchester.
Are you back?

46:53.978 --> 46:56.813
Here you are, girls.
For food and that.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.568
Be good.
Try not to wind her up, yeah?

47:03.488 --> 47:05.197
I love you both.

47:14.916 --> 47:16.124
What's going on?

47:16.209 --> 47:19.586
Never mind that.
Come on, out the way, knobhead!

47:25.468 --> 47:26.635
Where is it?

47:28.012 --> 47:30.972
Dad? I left it to dry
on the radiator.

47:33.267 --> 47:35.018
I need my T-shirt.

47:36.145 --> 47:37.562
I'm going to Spike Island.

48:08.219 --> 48:11.555
No. I'm going to be taking orders
from twats for the rest of my life.

48:11.639 --> 48:13.056
I'm not taking any more from you.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.766
I don't want you to go.

48:14.850 --> 48:19.229
Dad, I know you're not well,
and I love you and all,

48:19.313 --> 48:23.650
but if you don't get out of my way now, I
swear to God I'll bite your fucking nose off!

49:50.279 --> 49:51.863
I'm sorry, Dad.

49:52.156 --> 49:53.990
Why? What've you done?

49:54.075 --> 49:55.492
Nowt. Just...

49:55.576 --> 49:58.244
Getting off? Don't worry about me.

49:58.621 --> 50:00.413
- But...
- Your mam still here?

50:02.750 --> 50:05.669
- Yeah. She's asleep.
- I'll be all right, then.

50:07.088 --> 50:08.380
Go on.

50:09.048 --> 50:10.799
Have a good day.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.802
- I don't have to.
- Yeah, you do.

50:17.264 --> 50:18.723
- Dad...
- Don't say it, son.

50:20.184 --> 50:21.434
There's no need.

50:22.103 --> 50:25.522
I'm going nowhere. Promise.

50:37.535 --> 50:39.077
I love you, Dad.

50:56.429 --> 50:57.721
Here he is.

50:57.805 --> 50:59.889
- Here he is.
- I overslept.

50:59.974 --> 51:02.892
- You're a knob.
- No, I'm not. Fuck you.

51:05.438 --> 51:06.980
Where the fuck have you been?

51:07.064 --> 51:09.065
I met with our Ste.
Had a bit of a mad night. Soz.

51:09.150 --> 51:11.234
You absolute fucking wanker.

51:11.318 --> 51:14.654
- But he's got us on the guest list.
- You absolute fucking diamond.

51:16.115 --> 51:17.240
Come on.

51:17.825 --> 51:19.325
Where's your Roses tee?

51:19.452 --> 51:20.827
It was still wet.

51:23.247 --> 51:26.499
Mate, look, you've got dog shit
all over your trousers, lad. You have!

51:26.584 --> 51:27.917
Zip!

51:28.002 --> 51:29.419
Come on, then.

51:32.173 --> 51:34.257
- Stick that on, then.
- Fuck him.

51:34.759 --> 51:36.009
Are you sure?

51:36.093 --> 51:37.510
Shit, he's in
there, I can hear him.

51:37.595 --> 51:38.678
I can fucking smell him.

51:43.934 --> 51:46.269
What the fuck do we do now?

51:46.353 --> 51:47.854
Has anyone seen E.T.?

51:54.528 --> 51:56.112
Fuck off!

52:32.900 --> 52:34.025
Fucking pants!

52:34.318 --> 52:35.485
Shh!

52:50.584 --> 52:51.876
Shh.

52:56.257 --> 52:57.590
Ready?

52:58.175 --> 52:59.259
Go!

53:03.597 --> 53:04.681
Zip, you know where we're going?

53:04.765 --> 53:07.016
Yeah. Been there with my dad
on a bit of work. It's fuck-all away.

53:08.727 --> 53:09.936
Shall we get out of this
shithole then, or what?

53:10.020 --> 53:11.729
Go, go, go, go, go!

53:21.407 --> 53:22.448
Oi!

53:26.245 --> 53:28.121
Go, go, go!

53:31.417 --> 53:32.625
Burn rubber, Zips!

53:32.710 --> 53:35.128
Hey, check what he's got.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.797
What is it?
Fucking... Methadone!

53:37.882 --> 53:39.382
Oh, he's a wrong 'un, him,
a wrong 'un, mate.

53:39.466 --> 53:40.800
It fucking stinks in here.

53:42.386 --> 53:44.304
Whoa!

53:44.430 --> 53:46.806
- Where's Harold?
- Who the fuck's Harold?

53:46.891 --> 53:48.558
It's his van.

53:48.642 --> 53:49.893
Pull over, Zippy.

53:49.977 --> 53:51.895
I am! Take a chill pill!

53:53.731 --> 53:55.064
I thought she was all right.

53:55.149 --> 53:56.482
I think you're quite unwell.

53:56.567 --> 53:58.234
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Sorry, love!

54:03.407 --> 54:04.741
Here y'are, stick that on, Tits.

54:04.825 --> 54:07.076
- Is that the demo?
- No...

54:07.161 --> 54:08.661
This is the demo,

54:08.787 --> 54:11.831
but it's not coming out again until I'm
banging it in the hands of Stone Roses.

54:13.792 --> 54:16.836
Actually, fuck that, Tits. You take it.
Guard it with your life.

54:17.671 --> 54:19.005
Nice one.

54:29.350 --> 54:33.102
<i>♪ Soak me to my skin</i>

54:33.187 --> 54:36.773

55:15.354 --> 55:21.859
<i>♪ Submission ends it all</i>

55:26.907 --> 55:29.575
We come flying out of the Red
Bricks and hit the road out of town,

55:29.660 --> 55:33.079
with a cockpit full of weed smoke
and pockets full of E's and speed.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.581
Absolutely buzzing our nuts off.

55:35.666 --> 55:39.168
We were leaving Manchester
and a world of shite behind. We all were.

55:39.253 --> 55:41.170
Just for one day, anyway.

55:41.255 --> 55:45.258
You know what? Despite everything,
it felt fucking all right, man.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.760

55:49.263 --> 55:50.847

55:56.603 --> 55:59.272
- Ooh, look!
- Wow. How fucking camp was that?

55:59.398 --> 56:00.440
Look at what?

56:00.566 --> 56:02.608
- Warrington.
- Ace. What about it?

56:02.693 --> 56:05.695
Ian Brown's birthplace.
They should erect a statue.

56:05.779 --> 56:08.698
I'd like to erect a statue.
In Lisa Hughes' fanny!

56:11.118 --> 56:12.452
What exactly
are you doing there?

56:12.578 --> 56:13.619
Slipping her one.

56:13.704 --> 56:16.372
- Slipping a fucking disc.
- Oh, we should take a detour.

56:16.457 --> 56:17.957
I'd like to take a detour...

56:18.083 --> 56:19.625
To Lisa Hughes' fanny!

56:20.461 --> 56:21.961
Yeah, he's never even seen a fanny.

56:23.297 --> 56:24.464
Except when he looks in the mirror!

56:27.968 --> 56:29.218
H it him, Little Gaz.

56:29.928 --> 56:31.387
We're nearly there now, anyway.

56:31.472 --> 56:32.555
What? How?

56:32.639 --> 56:34.307
I ain't even seen a
sign for Widnes yet.

56:34.391 --> 56:35.725
Widnes?

56:41.815 --> 56:42.982
They sound the same.

56:43.067 --> 56:45.485
What?
Like "you dick" and "you prick"?

56:52.326 --> 56:53.451
Who's the driver?

56:54.161 --> 56:55.661
This goon.

56:55.788 --> 56:57.997
Right. Did you not bring a map?

56:58.457 --> 57:00.166
- No.
- Did you not look at a map?

57:00.667 --> 57:02.460
- No.
- Right.

57:03.504 --> 57:04.921
Well, this is you...

57:06.090 --> 57:10.593
This is Widnes, and this is the M6.
It's going to be your little friend.

57:10.677 --> 57:13.096
You want to take him south
to junction 21 A,

57:13.180 --> 57:16.265
get on the M62 towards Liverpool,
junction 10.

57:16.350 --> 57:20.353
Follow the signs from there, Bob's
your uncle, fanny's a rude word.

57:21.021 --> 57:22.271
Thanks, Suzanne.

57:22.356 --> 57:24.941
- Pleasure. Going to Spike Island?
- Yeah.

57:25.025 --> 57:26.192
I'll keep my eyes peeled for you.

57:26.693 --> 57:27.944
Especially for you.

57:29.696 --> 57:31.697
Oh, and do us a favour,
will you?

57:31.782 --> 57:33.866
Tell your thieving little bastard mates
to put everything back,

57:33.951 --> 57:35.535
else I'll lock the door
and get the Dobermans in.

57:40.791 --> 57:42.125
That was your fault, Dodge.

57:42.209 --> 57:43.376
How d'you work that one out?

57:43.460 --> 57:45.128
She's seen the box
fall out of your tracky top.

57:45.212 --> 57:46.879
What was you robbing
Tampax for, anyway?

57:46.964 --> 57:49.132
I didn't know what they were,
I couldn't read it, could I?

57:49.216 --> 57:51.300
I thought they were
individually wrapped biscuits.

58:02.187 --> 58:03.312
Roses!

58:11.196 --> 58:13.239
Hey, hey, Spike Island!

58:13.323 --> 58:15.032
We'll be there shortly!

58:19.037 --> 58:21.998
- Here y'are, Zippy, turn it in.
- What're you on about?

58:22.082 --> 58:23.666
You can't tap your feet
while they're on the pedals.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.501
- I'm not!
- Then what the fuck are you doing?

58:25.586 --> 58:27.503
- Nish and klish.
- Then why's the van spazzing out?

58:27.588 --> 58:29.589
- I don't know.
- Shut it. Turn the tunes off.

58:31.008 --> 58:32.175
It doesn't sound well.

58:32.259 --> 58:34.760
Might be a daft question,
but have we got any juice in it?

58:34.887 --> 58:36.679
Yeah.
It was full this morning.

58:39.766 --> 58:41.601
What?

58:41.727 --> 58:43.728
Fuck! You're joking me!

58:58.076 --> 58:59.202
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

58:59.286 --> 59:00.328
Fucking fuck!

59:00.454 --> 59:01.621
Word!

59:03.165 --> 59:04.957
We can't hang about here.

59:06.001 --> 59:08.377
- What the fuck's he doing?
- Climbing the van, clearly.

59:08.462 --> 59:10.004
- Why?
- Reconnaissance.

59:10.130 --> 59:11.172
What?

59:11.298 --> 59:13.257
If we walk six fields northwest,

59:13.800 --> 59:17.303
there's a motorway running perpendicular.
I think it has to be the M6.

59:19.932 --> 59:21.182
Come on!

59:21.308 --> 59:24.644
Are we really following this retard?
What about the van?

59:24.770 --> 59:26.270
I've remembered its position.

59:28.690 --> 59:31.317
I'll watch your van for a tenner!

59:31.443 --> 59:34.987
You can watch my arse disappear
for fuck-all, you cheeky twat.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.492
Right, come on, back on the bus.

01:00:57.738 --> 01:00:59.113
Shh!

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:03.868
Spike Island!

01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:09.165
Oh!

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:11.250
Dirty bastard!

01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:22.053
Zippy. Please tell me that's not
your cock digging in my back.

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:23.804
I can't help it,
it's the vibrations!

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.307
For fuck's sake!

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:40.112
- We're slowing down.
- We must be nearly there.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:41.697
Thank fuck for that.
I think I've broke my arse.

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:44.283
Someone's arse deffo ain't working right,
or they've been eating rats.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:47.286
- Get your Stone Roses T-shirts!
- T-shirts!

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.413
<i>♪ I pray</i>

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:53.459

<i>♪ Keep me praying

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:58.047
- Have we stopped?
- Yeah.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.633
Whatever happens, we stay together.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:03.260
Three, two, one.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:09.934
Hey! What do you think I use wing
mirrors for, you little toe rags!

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.614
Come on, Pen, leg it!

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:36.752
Shit! Where's Penfold?

01:02:36.837 --> 01:02:38.671
- Fucks knows!
- Pen?

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:41.048
He couldn't have gone far.
Just look for his sun hat.

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:44.385
Pen! Penfold!

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:45.553
Penfold!

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:47.596
Pen-is!
Pen-is, where are you?

01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:49.682
- Penfold!
- Ah, steady!

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:51.725
- Penfold!
- Pen!

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:53.727
- Penfold!
- Pen-is!

01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:55.688
Pen-is, where are you?

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:58.023
Ah, fuck that, man.
Let's head down to the main gate.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:06.323
Reni hats! Get your Reni hats here!
Get your fucking Reni hats here!

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.325
Go on, Manchester!

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:15.791
Roses souvenir posters!
Two for a tenner.

01:03:15.876 --> 01:03:17.710
He's got no shirt on!

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:24.383
Hot dogs!
Free ketchup or lan Brown sauce!

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:28.387
You can see the gate from there.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:29.555
Yeah.

01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:34.560
Here we go, lads!
Fucking Mersey paradise!

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:11.597
Rights, boys, let's have it!

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:15.100
Right, tickets out, please.

01:04:15.227 --> 01:04:16.602
Go 'head, Bananarama,
straight in!

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.897
- Here y'are, sweet cheeks, get in there!
- It's Bez!

01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:21.565
- Do the dance!
- Go ahead, lad, do it.

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.400
Oh! You're in, you're in!

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:25.069
- Mate, hang on, how old are you?
- Eighteen.

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:26.445
Eighteen?
I've got porn mags older than you!

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:30.407
Cheese and Marmite together? On the
same butty? That's fucking repellent.

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:33.077
- Can I have it back, then?
- No. Get to fuck, go on.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.955
- You all right, mate?
- I'm not your mate. Tickets.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:37.456
Should be on the guest list.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:38.916
Yeah, and I should be
on the telly, lad.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.167
Here you are, Sid, get on these.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:41.335
Go ahead, whose list?

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:44.088
- Ibiza Ste's.
- Who the fuck is Ibiza Ste?

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:46.465
- My brother.
- Why d'you call him that?

01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:47.800
'Cause we've got the
same mum and dad.

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:49.093
I mean "Ibiza Ste"?

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:51.720
All right, 'cause he lives in Ibiza
and his name's Ste.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.306
Oh, yeah, got it.
Nice one, yeah. Boss name.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:55.849
Yeah, he's a Manc legend!

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.101
A Manc leg-end, no less.

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:58.769
Well, welcome
to fucking Merseyside, son.

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.272
We don't know no Ibiza Ste
and he hasn't got no fucking guest list.

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:04.275
Yeah, well, try Red Bricks Ste? He used
to live there before he moved to Ibiza.

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:05.401
Stop it, will you?

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.236
You'll ruin it for me
when his autobiography comes out.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.405
Try the Roses. Mani.
I sort him out with hair gel.

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:11.407
Go ahead, what's your names?

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:14.410
Gary Titchfield, Darren Hodge, Chris
Weeks, Gareth Barret and Andrew Peach.

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:15.869
No. You're not down.

01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:18.163
- Try Shadow Caster. We're a band.
- Fuck off!

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:19.415
Mate, we're a support band.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:22.418
Oh, the support band.
Oh, sorry, lads, in that case...

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:23.627
Fuck off!

01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:26.505
No tickets, no guest list,
no entry, no chance.

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:29.425
Now fucking yabba-dabba-do one,
dickheads!

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:32.052
Go 'head, move! Do one, you beaut!

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:33.491
Well, that went well.

01:05:33.517 --> 01:05:35.372
Can't believe he's never
heard of Ibiza Ste.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.349
- I can.
- There's got to be a fuck-up.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.143
Yeah, there is. He's called Ste.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:42.646
- Hands in the air, put your tickets up.
- So what are we gonna do now, then, Tits?

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:43.981
Get in.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:45.858
Let's just fucking rush it, man.

01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:48.527
Yeah? On my count, right.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:51.363
One, two...

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:53.741
Three.
For fuck's sake, who runs on "two"?

01:05:54.326 --> 01:05:56.160
No one runs on "two".

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:57.661
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:05:57.746 --> 01:05:59.163
They're charging, Dave!

01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:09.840
Get out! Go on! And you!

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.385
And you, Granddad, get off!

01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:17.097
Get back!

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:18.932
This is our bridge!

01:06:19.059 --> 01:06:20.100
Fucking hippies.

01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:22.311
Let that be a lesson
to all of you.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:24.438
- Yes!
- Here we go!

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:27.566
- Liverpool 2, Man U...
- Nil!

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:31.987
Have it!

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:35.658
What d'you reckon?

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:38.369
I'm not fucking swimming in that.
No.

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:40.871
I wonder what time it is.
We've got to meet the girls.

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.414
Nearly 3:45.

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:44.917
What the fuck was that?

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:46.418
Some sort of animal?

01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:48.837
Here y'are, lads,
d'you wanna buy a dinghy ride?

01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:50.881
- What did he just say?
- Fuck knows.

01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:52.132
"Dez-a-by-diggy-bat"?

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:53.801
D'yous wanna buy a dinghy ride?

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.177
I'm still not getting it.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:56.845
Soz, mate, it's just white noise.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.764
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.978
Oh! Do we want to buy a dinghy?

01:07:05.105 --> 01:07:07.773
A dinghy ride! I row yous!

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.858
- Where's your oars?
- Side of me head!

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:12.277
- No, you're all right, mate.
- Let's just do one.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.530
- Do yous want to buy a dinghy ride?
- What?

01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:17.783
- He'll row you. For cash. With no oars.
- Sound!

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.785
- How much?
- Fiver each.

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:21.704
- Here.
- It's right.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.123
Oh, mate, I'm watching this!

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:25.999
Come on, come on, hurry up!
Hurry up!

01:07:26.126 --> 01:07:27.459
Would you get in a boat
with this prick?

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:30.212
- Easy! Easy!
- Wouldn't even get in a lift with him.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.382
I'm the captain on this ship.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:35.718
Just don't do nothing.
Leave it to me.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.389
Ah! It's going to
tip if you do that.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:42.057
Can't swim!

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.897
We should probably get back
to the main gate, you know.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:50.649
Penfold might be waiting for us.

01:07:50.859 --> 01:07:52.192
Might even see the girls turn up.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:53.819
Or Ibiza Ste.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.906
Oh, here we go, look who it is.

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:02.578
All right, Tits?

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:03.704
All right, Dave Famous?

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:08.167
- Got tickets?
- Have you?

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:09.585
Have you?

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.672
- No, neither have we.
- Supposed to be on the list, but...

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:15.340
So were we, but...

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:18.719
Listen, Dave,
let's cut the bollocks, yeah?

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:21.345
We all know you think
we're shit dickheads, yeah?

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.560
Well, we think you're double shit dickheads.
But we're both bang into the Roses, so...

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:31.607
If one of us spots a jib, we should
probably give each other a shout or summat.

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:33.567
- All right, sound.
- Sound. In a bit.

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:35.194
In bits.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.948
State of that tracksuit.
He looks like a fucking Smurf!

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:48.707
Come on, hurry up.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:51.794
I could see right up her skirt then.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.045
Do you know what I wish?

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.380
We had a Motorola.
Then we could ring Ste.

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.216
Or the girls,
but they'd have to have one, too.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:08:59.718
Do you know what I wish?

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:01.053
Go ahead,
it's getting good, this game.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:03.805
You'd sorted it out with your
kid properly last night, Tits,

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.724
instead of getting fucking caned
or whatever you did.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.102
Shall I tell you what I
done last night, Dodge?

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:10.312
What?

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:12.231
I sat with me mam,
waiting for me dad to die.

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:15.526
Yeah, I sat with me mam, and waited
for my useless prick of a brother

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.903
to sort out leaving a fucking pub
and come to the hospital.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.948
But he never managed that. So shut the
fuck up about him sorting us out.

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.573
The guy's a dick, and you're
doing me fucking head in.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.910
But you told me he was all right,
you told me he was getting better.

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:26.620
This isn't fucking
about you, Dodge.

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:27.830
What's that supposed to mean?

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:29.622
Nothing. I...

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.125
I just mean we come here
for one fucking reason, right?

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.045
To see The Stone Roses,
so can we please stop pissing

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:37.421
and moaning and get on
with trying to get in.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.511
Oi, Tits!

01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:46.932
Tits! Listen, man!

01:09:58.778 --> 01:09:59.945
Tits!

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:08.787
- Are you all right?
- No, not really.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:11.123
I've just been wandering
around on my own like a lemon.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:13.792
I lost the girls coming
over the bridge.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:16.962
Why didn't you just go in?

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.422
What? I don't know.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:21.758
There's, like, 20-odd thousand heads
in there and...

01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:25.137
I had a quarter of an acid on the train
and I got a bit para.

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:27.890
You said you'd be there.
Left-hand side of the stage.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:31.310
Yeah, but it doesn't matter anyway,
I can just come in with yous lot.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:33.145
If that's all right?

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.564
We still haven't got tickets.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.149
Oh, shit!

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:38.650
Yeah. Shit.

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:41.236
Well, I am not going
in there on my own.

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:43.155
What? You'll miss the Roses?

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:47.200
Well, one of yous lot
could have my ticket.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.913
- I'll have it.
- Behave.

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:52.331
What? I said it first.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.875
Shouldn't we toss a coin
or have an arm-wrestle or summat?

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:58.045
It's about the music, innit?
I'm the only one that understands it.

01:10:58.171 --> 01:10:59.922
Come on, Tits, you know how much
this means to me, man.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:04.927
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:09.973
There you are.

01:11:10.058 --> 01:11:11.391
Nice one.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.395
Right then,
see you after here, yeah?

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.232
Mate! Dodge!

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:21.526
Take this with you.

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:24.071
What? Why?
You said you'd do it.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:25.697
You're the one who's going in,
aren't you?

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:28.367
Yeah, but I'm not gonna get in backstage
on my own, am I, without you?

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:31.536
Yeah, well, get down the front, then, Dodge.
Just lob it at lan or John.

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.705
I'd mong it into the mud.
You're a miles better thrower than me.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:36.208
But I'm not going to hit the
fucking stage from out here, am I?

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:41.254
It'll be right. You'll get in. You keep it.
You know I'd fuck it up.

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:47.302
Listen, if you do get in,
meet me at the sound desk.

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:49.471
If not, I'll see you back
after here, yeah?

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.223
Yeah.

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:53.767
Don't go fucking off without me.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:56.895
Right, mate.

01:11:58.564 --> 01:11:59.773
Sorted.

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:01.400
Yeah, mate, sorted as fuck.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.621
Is, um... Is my make-up run?

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:16.581
Just a smidge.

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.291
I must look like a right dog.

01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:21.253
No, you don't.
Like a really pretty panda.

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:24.923
Oi, Dave Famous!
What are you saying?

01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:27.926
- What are you saying?
- Let's not do this again. I can't be arsed.

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.846
Some kid just said a mob have
flattened the vehicle gate.

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:34.307
You can get across the bridge to them
fields next to the fence. In a bit!

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:37.102
Hey, up you get!

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.896
Tell you what, I could
do with a massive disco shit.

01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:41.356
Oh, that's hanging.

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:43.150
Soz, but it's all
the whizz and excitement.

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:45.485
Whoa!
Watch your three-stripes there.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:47.696
It's probably radioactive.

01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:51.950
- All right? Go on.
-  Yeah.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.038
- You up?
- Yeah.

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:34.159
- Fuck!
- Shit!

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:42.000
How thick do you think it is?

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:44.002
Don't know.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:48.673
What are we gonna do now?

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:55.263
For fuck's sake.
I don't have a clue.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.030
Little cock-knockers!

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:15.033
What? Can you see owt?

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:16.368
No...

01:14:17.537 --> 01:14:19.121
We'll still be able to hear it,
though, won't we?

01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:21.123
It's a fucking nightmare,
isn't it?

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:36.930
And as the sun went down
over the chemical plant,

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:40.100
the wind was blowing the sound
from inside the site in waves,

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:43.770
washing over us,
then fucking off down the estuary.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:46.565
With Penfold missing in action,
and Dodge doing what he'd done,

01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:48.233
we were suddenly two men down.

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:50.569
But we were one girl up.

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:54.239
And it was funny, man, because it had
always been about me and Dodge.

01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:58.118
We'd always been on our own journey,
ever since we were nippers.

01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:00.620
Fucking Batman and Robin,
you know what I mean?

01:15:01.372 --> 01:15:04.875
But it wasn't just a massive fuck-off metal
green fence that had come between us.

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:06.626
I was on a different trip now.

01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:20.765
The night was beautiful, special.
So was Sally Harris.

01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:25.854
And then we heard it.

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:29.316
The roar of cheers that told us
the Roses had walked on stage,

01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:31.359
and the rumble of Mani's bass.

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:35.947
The greatest party in the history of
the world, and we weren't invited.

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:40.243
The Stone Roses
are on the other side of that wall.

01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:42.078
Wish I were 10 feet taller.

01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:44.247
Look, Gaz, give us a peg up.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.561

I'm gonna say something.
He's taking the piss.

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:22.012
- Out of who?
- Dodge.

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:25.056
Are you being serious?

01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:27.309
Yeah. He's supposed
to be his best mate.

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:29.394
He is. Why do you think he's
never done it before, you clown?

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:32.397
- What?
- You must be fucking blind.

01:17:39.405 --> 01:17:41.197
What's the matter?

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:44.409
Nothing. Dodge.

01:17:46.537 --> 01:17:50.373
You do know you just called
me Dodge. That explains everything.

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:52.542
No, I mean...

01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:55.712
Dodge is into you.

01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:58.131
What?

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:01.760
He's... He's never even spoke
to me until tonight.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:04.387
Yeah, I know.
But I'm being serious.

01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:06.598
He has been since we
were little kids.

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:08.600
Right.

01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:11.895
Shit. Okay.

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:14.147
What? And you haven't?

01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:18.860
Zippy, Tits and Sally
was always gonna happen.

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:21.279
It's only right that it's here, now.

01:18:21.781 --> 01:18:22.906
Straight up?

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.241
Straight back down again.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.828
I remember you kissed me in the
playground at Grey Bank Primary.

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:30.789
It made me feel double sick.

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:34.125
I never even noticed your hair then.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:39.506
I had no idea I'd end up...
dancing with you.

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:44.469
No one fucking told me then that your hand
had been made just spot on to fit in mine.

01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:50.975
Your laugh used to really annoy me.
Now it makes me feel like skinning up.

01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:57.023
I should have just kissed you back then.
Would have made all this miles easier.

01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:00.026
All what?

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:04.781
I'm fucking bananas about you.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.001
What's happening?

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.338
The wind's changed direction.

01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:23.007

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:59.956
It was blowing it in here.
You should've heard Resurrection.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.500
I did. I was here for all of it.

01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:08.172

01:22:08.299 --> 01:22:10.049

01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:17.223
Literally never felt better.

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:19.350
- You're covered in blood.
- Yeah, I know.

01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:23.896
It's not mine. Got booted out,
early doors, for fighting.

01:22:24.982 --> 01:22:26.190

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:27.734

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:32.864
- What van?
- That fucker.

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:36.326
Some cunt nicked mine.

01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:43.082

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:45.835
Oh, yeah. Top. Never got in.

01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:49.922
Did you go to the VIP gate?
You was down on the VIP gate.

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:51.549
How's me dad?

01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:53.760

tell you to meet us here, or what?

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:55.386
Penfold? We lost him hours ago.

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:58.306
He were bowling round back stage,
piss-wet through.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.726
He'd only swum the fucking Mersey.
The kid's a legend.

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:03.519
All aboard!

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:16.509
Manchester, la la la!

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:32.191
Over here.

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:42.994
Nice one, mate.

01:24:46.874 --> 01:24:48.958
Don't worry about him.

01:24:49.042 --> 01:24:51.169
The guy's a fucking dick.

01:25:24.661 --> 01:25:25.828
Yeah.

01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:43.387

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:50.019

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:05.117

01:26:21.468 --> 01:26:24.136
All right? What the fuck
happened to you, Keith Teeth?

01:26:24.263 --> 01:26:25.388
I done a sicky burp.

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:27.014
No, I mean with the tickets,

01:26:27.099 --> 01:26:29.392
What are you on about? I give them

01:26:29.476 --> 01:26:31.978
- Who?
- Him. Fucking Harry Handsome.

01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:34.647
What's up with you? Are you having
some sort of seizure or summat?

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:38.609
- Gary, I...
- Don't fucking bother. Cunt.

01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:41.946
- What did you just call me?
- You heard me. I called you a cunt.

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:43.322
Oops. Major buzz-kill.

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:45.867
Here y'are, lads, leave it out.
For fuck's sake, know what I mean?

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:47.493
If Eric could see yous both now.

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:48.953

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:50.204
Yeah, all right, yeah.

01:26:50.289 --> 01:26:52.206
- Lads, don't do this, not now.
- Stay out of it, Carlos.

01:26:52.291 --> 01:26:54.417
I'd listen to him if I were you, Gary.
Before I bend your bones.

01:26:54.585 --> 01:26:56.252
Haven't you hurt him enough?
You're his brother.

01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:59.171
- Wind your neck in, little girl.
- Lads, seriously. Look, Tits, yeah?

01:26:59.298 --> 01:27:00.923
See that straight goer over there
with the shite hair?

01:27:01.008 --> 01:27:03.092
- Yeah, what about him?
- He's the Roses' manager.

01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:04.927
- That's the Roses' manager?
- Yeah.

01:27:05.012 --> 01:27:07.054
- He looks like a fucking hairdresser.
- He looks like a dick.

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:08.180
He is. Both.

01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:09.307
Shut up, Ste.

01:27:10.601 --> 01:27:15.563
Mover's on guitars, Ballbag keys,
Two Socks drums...

01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:19.317
Give him the tape, Tits.
Give him the fucking tape. Demo him up.

01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:21.652
Excuse me.

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:25.656
- So what did you say you were called again?
- The Palaver.

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:27.366
- Cool name.
- Yeah.

01:27:28.327 --> 01:27:29.493
Really cool.

01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:32.371
- Yeah. I thought of it myself.
- So, when are you on tour?

01:27:32.497 --> 01:27:33.664
Couple of weeks.

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:39.879
Tits, if this is a wind-up,
it's not funny.

01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:42.965
Check all your pockets again.

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:44.675
- I have. Twenty times.
- It's got to be somewhere.

01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:45.968
Yeah, somewhere on Spike Island.

01:27:46.053 --> 01:27:47.178
When did you last see it?

01:27:47.304 --> 01:27:48.346
When I tried giving it to Dodge.

01:27:48.472 --> 01:27:49.555
When you fucked off with Sally.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.057
- Don't be a dick.
- I'm not a dick.

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:52.391
I'm not the one that's
lost the tape, am I?

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:53.809
All right, for fuck's sake,
Dodge, calm down.

01:27:53.894 --> 01:27:56.187
It don't matter.
It's not the only fucking copy.

01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:00.483
Is it?
Are you taking the piss?

01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:02.234
Happy days! Nice one!

01:28:02.653 --> 01:28:04.195
- Knobhead.
- For fuck's sake, Dodge.

01:28:04.321 --> 01:28:06.238
Hang on a minute,
how come I'm suddenly the twat?

01:28:06.365 --> 01:28:09.283
Tits is the one that's lost the tape.
He's the one that's naused it all up for us.

01:28:09.368 --> 01:28:12.536
- Fuck off, Dodge.
- No, you fuck off. The lot of you.

01:28:12.663 --> 01:28:15.623
I am Shadow Caster. If it weren't for me,
there wouldn't even be a tape.

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:19.043
If it weren't for me, you'd still
be learning your first chords.

01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:21.462
Sorry, lads.

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:23.756
Fucking say sorry to me.

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:26.384
Apologise to me, Tits.
'Cause that tape, the band...

01:28:26.677 --> 01:28:28.260
You know I can't do fuck-all else.

01:28:28.387 --> 01:28:30.471
Well, yeah, 'cause you're
thick as pigshit, aren't you?

01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:33.391
Just born stupid.
No, I'm sick of wiping your arse.

01:28:33.517 --> 01:28:35.393
And yours! And yours!

01:28:36.728 --> 01:28:39.063
Mate, you could even have taken it
into the fucking gig.

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:41.315
You could have tried to get it to the band.
But you never.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.985
You put it all on me,
like you have done all our lives.

01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:45.695
Even when you knew
the score with me old man,

01:28:45.779 --> 01:28:49.031
you shot off into that gig without a
thought for any twat other than you.

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.243
Next to him, you're the most selfish
prick I've ever fucking met.

01:28:53.704 --> 01:28:55.788
What?
You gonna snap my jaw now?

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:57.039
Go on, Tits.

01:28:57.124 --> 01:28:58.708
No, am I fuck.

01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:05.297
Oh, fuck!

01:29:07.968 --> 01:29:09.301
Steady on!

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:30.239
Greetings, Earthlings!

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:57.433
It's what ears were invented for, man.

01:29:57.976 --> 01:30:01.645
It's the most beautiful 12 inches
of vinyl ever produced.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:05.066
It shimmers and jangles like...

01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:09.653
...sunshine and rain,
sends shivers up your spine.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.240
It's like...

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:17.078
It's like, I don't know, like the
Roses wrote that album just for me.

01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:20.664
Bollocks!

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.918
They wrote it just for me.

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:27.421
No, they wrote it for us.

01:30:34.137 --> 01:30:35.763
Are you all right?

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:40.017
Yeah.

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:42.812
Yeah, I am.

01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:48.859
Do you want to go back to mine?

01:30:51.029 --> 01:30:52.196
Yeah.

01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:03.624
Oh!

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.846
Gary?

01:34:09.227 --> 01:34:12.688
It's funny what makes people
different, makes us special.

01:34:14.024 --> 01:34:15.316
Legends.

01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:21.405
I suppose some people
are just born to stand out.

01:34:25.744 --> 01:34:29.079
You don't have to be stood on a stage
singing tunes to be a hero.

01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:33.709
My old man done it grafting
on a market every day but Sunday.

01:34:57.942 --> 01:35:03.405
<i>♪ Stop your crying now, laddie
Dry your tears</i>

01:35:05.283 --> 01:35:11.288
<i>♪ There's no bogeyman
to get you, never fear</i>

01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:17.044
<i>♪ There's no ogres, wicked witches</i>

01:35:17.128 --> 01:35:20.297
<i>♪ Only greedy sons of bitches</i>

01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:26.470
<i>♪ Who are waiting to exploit
your life away</i>

01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:35.396
<i>♪ No more talking now,
it's time to go to sleep</i>

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:43.737
<i>♪ There are answers to your
questions, but they'll keep</i>

01:35:44.948 --> 01:35:48.742
<i>♪ Go on asking while you grow, son</i>

01:35:48.827 --> 01:35:52.329
<i>♪ Go on asking till you know, son</i>

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:58.585
<i>♪ And then send the answers
ringing through the world ♪</i>

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:35.164
So, when do you want to get off?

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:37.875
Who says I'm going?

01:36:39.294 --> 01:36:40.377
Me.

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:46.383
Don't have to be
full-time, you know.

01:36:46.509 --> 01:36:50.471
With The Palaver, I could just do the
tour and then we could do it again.

01:36:50.555 --> 01:36:52.389
Make a new tape.

01:36:53.016 --> 01:36:56.977
No. It was only right at
that moment in time.

01:36:58.229 --> 01:37:00.564
You said it yourself,
it was special, weren't it?

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:04.026
It was perfect.
Just wouldn't be the same.

01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:07.905
We can do anything we want.

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:11.241
We're Shadow Caster.

01:37:11.409 --> 01:37:13.076
From Manchester.

01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:19.041
It ain't where you're from, Dodge.
It's where you're at.

01:37:39.938 --> 01:37:45.567
Just for a bit, in a time and a place,
The Stone Roses made everything right.

01:37:46.903 --> 01:37:51.949
Not just for me, but for all of us.
My generation, or whatever.

01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:59.206
That night at Spike Island
was the night when it all came together.

01:38:00.208 --> 01:38:03.585
It was also pretty much the beginning
of an end...of everything.
