02:09.400 --> 02:11.560
Well, my roommate and I
are big Tru-Sé fans.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.120
We had tickets to your Toronto show,

02:13.240 --> 02:16.120
but then when Gareth got electrocuted
and you sadly canceled,

02:16.200 --> 02:17.280
we booked a flight.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.920
Lucky me.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.040
I cannot believe you said, "Lucky me,"
when your bandmate got third-degree burns.

That should've been a red flag.

back out, we'll have to do it all again.

And they didn't even hate me!

10:05.120 --> 10:06.640
Hey, they loved you.

10:06.720 --> 10:07.800
Like I love you.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.400
I love you, too. It's a disaster.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.560
You know, once, she, uh,
she made us matching sailor suits.

10:14.640 --> 10:15.840
What a woman.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.720
Hey, that's one thing I love about you.
You don't smother me.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.320
No, I certainly do not.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.320
Mummy, Dr. Evan, hurry,
come look at the posh car!

10:23.400 --> 10:24.240
Okay.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.560
[Mum] Hurry up, sweetie.

10:30.240 --> 10:33.000
Come on, Dr. Evan! Your mum will want
to strap you in your booster seat.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.080
[Evan, quietly] Not now. Hey!

10:35.160 --> 10:37.480
-[Katherine] Wow.
-[Evan] Nice car, eh?

10:39.600 --> 10:40.840
[Bev] I know you're knackered.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.400
I know. I'm tired too, Tom.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.080
-[doorbell rings]
-All right, the door's going.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.200
Hi, my love. How are you feeling?

10:49.280 --> 10:50.840
Ah, I'm perfectly fine, darlin'.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.040
Turns out a blood clot can strike
out of the blue, anytime, anywhere,

10:54.120 --> 10:55.280
even at my young age.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.480
Terrifying.

10:56.880 --> 11:01.520
Maybe you and Katherine
join my Pilates group, keep it all moving.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.200
Oh, that's kind, but we already swim.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.960
Oh, where do you do that?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.120
We do it together.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.720
Oh, that sounds like fun.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.000
Um, well, let's do something else
this week, shall we?

11:10.080 --> 11:12.040
I'd love to,
but we're really up against it.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.560
We're behind on prep for a big event.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.320
Event? I love events.

11:15.400 --> 11:19.000
Head girl, prom committee,
Celebrate Sobriety Convention chair.

11:19.080 --> 11:19.960
What needs doing?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.440
I mean, have you got a car?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.360
I've got two cars. And a van.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.960
Okay. Uh, why don't you help me
take some of the heavier shit

11:27.040 --> 11:28.080
down to the venue?

11:28.160 --> 11:29.920
It's a body positivity thing,

11:30.000 --> 11:31.680
so it's a big opportunity
for the business.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.200
Great. Take my number,
my phone is always on,

11:34.280 --> 11:37.480
and I will rearrange some stuff
and see if I can join you for swimming!

11:37.560 --> 11:41.040
Okay, I've got to get back to work, Jane,
but we'll see you there, babe, all right?

11:41.120 --> 11:43.200
-Okay, bye.
-Do you swim locally?

11:43.960 --> 11:45.080
[chuckles] Hmm.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.480
[sighs]

11:46.560 --> 11:47.880

11:47.960 --> 11:49.000

11:59.040 --> 12:04.160
Ladies, welcome to Ardour Live
body positivity headline talk.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.640
<i>-</i>Now I trust--
-[quietly] These bloody incisions.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.800
Should you even be
out of your compression suit?

12:09.880 --> 12:13.080
Don't be silly. I've had fat grafting,
what, half a dozen times?

12:13.160 --> 12:15.320
Wouldn't hurt to keep the bandages on
an extra few days.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.560
Listen, you need to stay in your lane,
all right? Let me sort out our branding.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.640
Trust me, we want to be at the forefront
of this body positivity movement.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.600
Well, I'm positive you just had
the forefront of your body sucked out

12:25.680 --> 12:26.920
and stuck back in your ass.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.080
Do you love it, though?

12:29.200 --> 12:32.320
I mean, yeah, totally worth
the death scare. It looks so good.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.000
It is my pleasure to introduce to you,
speaking candidly for the first time,

12:36.080 --> 12:39.720
body-positive potters, Kiln 'Em Softly.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.840
[applause and cheers]

12:43.520 --> 12:45.000
-Thank you.
-[Bev] Thank you.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.800
And in the celebrity world,
there is constant body shaming,

12:49.880 --> 12:53.640
and that's what motivated me to celebrate
all representations of the female form.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.800
You both have come so far,

12:55.880 --> 12:58.680
-from WAGs to feminists.
-[audience chuckles]

12:58.760 --> 12:59.720
Tell us about that.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.520
We were always feminists.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.720
You can be both a feminist
and be dating a member of a boy band.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.200
[laughter]

13:06.280 --> 13:09.400
Aw, that was taken right after we both
found out we were pregnant, remember?

13:09.720 --> 13:13.600
Oh, yeah. So Bev and I did meet because
our partners were in a group together

13:13.680 --> 13:15.080
and we were really like-minded.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.800
Yeah, straight away, we were like sisters.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.800
Right. So, Katherine...

13:19.200 --> 13:21.000
while Bev had her "proper family,"

13:21.080 --> 13:23.200
you were unable
to make your relationship work

13:23.280 --> 13:25.600
with Tru-Sé boy band star
Shepherd Knight.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.760
The press branded you an opportunist,
a gold digger.

13:29.160 --> 13:32.360
<i>Canada Today</i> went as far as to name you
"The Mountee."

13:32.440 --> 13:34.360
[scoffs] What a fun memory.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.640
[host] Sadly, baby Olive grew up
in a broken home.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.520
So where is your daughter right now?

13:41.000 --> 13:41.840
She's on a play-date.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.000
You don't have to constantly ask
working mothers where their kids are.

13:45.080 --> 13:48.400
[laughs] So you definitely weren't
interested in the money? At all?

13:48.480 --> 13:50.320
No, I just wanted
to fuck the guy on stage.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.360
[host] Well, I think we've learned
so much today

13:52.440 --> 13:55.680
about how to love ourselves
in our own aging skin.

13:58.160 --> 14:01.280
[dogs bark and pant]

14:02.720 --> 14:03.760
Come on.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.680
Yeah.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.640
[man] Oi!

14:08.800 --> 14:10.280
Those are my kid's dogs!

14:10.680 --> 14:12.560
Oh, Shep. Hi! It's, er...

14:12.920 --> 14:13.760
It's Evan.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.920
And you have permission
to be walking my daughter's property?

14:22.320 --> 14:23.400
I do, yeah.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.040
Okay.

14:30.880 --> 14:31.760
[dogs whimper]

14:33.200 --> 14:35.560
Would you be interested
in an investment opportunity?

14:35.640 --> 14:36.640
What have you got in mind?

14:36.720 --> 14:38.680
-Plums.
-Plums?

14:39.200 --> 14:40.680
They're the new superfood, man.

14:41.480 --> 14:45.720
Get this.
Saffron is more valuable than cocaine.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.800
It's the world's most expensive spice.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.280
Truffles cost more per gram than diamonds.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.360
We're talking about plums, though, right?
Like the fruit?

14:56.440 --> 14:58.000
Got a guy in the plum industry.

14:58.360 --> 15:02.040
Twelve percent of your vitamin C intake
in each one.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.200
Twelve, man!

15:03.760 --> 15:06.040
Wow, that sounds pretty moderate.
I'll, um...

15:06.120 --> 15:07.680
-I'll get back to you.
-Cool.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.760
You got a dog walker number
I can get you at?

15:10.400 --> 15:11.240
[Evan laughs]

15:11.760 --> 15:12.600
It's Evan, man.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.840
-[mouths]
-Evan.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.880
Evan. Katherine's boyfriend.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.200
-You and my ex?
-Yeah.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.760
[sighs]

15:20.840 --> 15:23.240
She can be sneaky, man.
Watch out for that one.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.520
Wh... what do you mean?

15:24.600 --> 15:27.400
I'd just hate to see
a nice guy like you get hurt. [sighs]

15:27.520 --> 15:28.760
Or maybe I'm out of line

15:28.840 --> 15:31.240
and you're cool with everything
that went down the other night.

15:32.160 --> 15:36.280
Her demanding sex off me and threatening
me with violence when I changed me mind.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.320
[laughs] God, I am glad I did not cum
into her hands when she begged me to.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.960
Millie's house is cool. She has her own
phone and she's getting an Apple Watch.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.520
[Katherine] That kid can tell time?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.600
[Olive] Stop that, Mummy,
we're friends now. How's Aunt Bev?

15:53.680 --> 15:55.960
[Katherine] Bum looks great,
and she made a mean lady cry

15:56.040 --> 15:56.920
and it went viral.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
PR is a strange old beast.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.080
Jameela Jamil embedded the footage
with the words,

16:01.160 --> 16:05.080
"Art is pain. So is being a woman.
Beautiful!" Isn't that great?

16:05.480 --> 16:08.400
But more press means more work.
What about having my baby?

16:08.480 --> 16:10.320
Hey, I can work and have a baby,
Piers Morgan.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.920
I was thinking,
if you promise not to have sex with him,

16:15.000 --> 16:16.840
maybe Dr. Evan can be the baby's dad.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.840
You think that would make sense?

16:19.920 --> 16:23.120
Yes. And he can go live on a boat
next to my dad's boat.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.360
Olive, I can't just collect dads
and keep 'em down by the river.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.600
-Well, where would he live then?
-Dr. Evan would live with us.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.560
No. I did the sleeping-over test
and now I've decided.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.400
He can live by the river
and the baby can live with us.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.360
Oh, <i>you've </i>decided?

16:38.440 --> 16:40.360
You don't get to decide
the big things in my life.

16:40.760 --> 16:41.800
I have choices, Olive,

16:41.880 --> 16:44.800
and I don't have to keep making bad ones
because I've made bad ones before.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.200
-[Shep yells]
-[Olive screams]

16:46.280 --> 16:47.680
-[Olive] Daddy!
-[laughs] Classic!

16:47.760 --> 16:49.760
-How have you got the dogs?
-I got them from Ethan.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.840
-Leave them. They're full of plum juice.
-What?

16:52.800 --> 16:55.800
Plums. The wood isn't commercially
available, but it can be used to make--

16:55.880 --> 16:57.200
No, Evan. You saw Evan?

16:57.280 --> 16:58.920
Yeah, I had a chat with him.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.480
That is one unhappy mangina.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.280
-[dog barks]
-[Shep] Hey!

17:04.040 --> 17:05.000
[Katherine] Oh, no.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.720
[pants]

17:11.960 --> 17:14.480
[pants and groans]

17:15.440 --> 17:16.440
[groans]

17:18.360 --> 17:19.560
[breathes heavily]

17:21.080 --> 17:22.080
Oh, hey.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.440
-[coughs] Where are you going?
-Home.

17:25.520 --> 17:26.800
Okay. So I'll see you later.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.240
Why? [scoffs] What were you gonna do
when you eventually got pregnant by Shep?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.160
Were you gonna tell me,
or make me think it was mine?

17:33.240 --> 17:35.680
No. I don't know what he told you,
but we didn't have sex.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.200
Then what were you doing with Shep?

17:37.280 --> 17:39.600
[sighs] It's like,
what if Olive needed bone marrow?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.480
B... Bone marrow?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.280
Her sibling would need to be a match.
I've been through a lot this week

17:44.360 --> 17:46.040
-with Bev nearly dying.
-Yeah, I was there.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.280
Well...

17:47.720 --> 17:50.440
If I died, they would split my kids up
if they had different dads.

17:51.120 --> 17:56.720
So you won't have my kids in case you die
and Olive needs a transplant?

17:57.360 --> 17:59.880
[breathes heavily]

17:59.960 --> 18:00.800
Well, yeah.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.800
Ah, that makes...
You're a total psycho, you know that?

18:03.880 --> 18:05.880
-Well...
-First, a sperm donor. Now Shep.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.760
I can explain, because--

18:07.840 --> 18:10.600
A guy who couldn't pass a piss test
to qualify as a sperm donor?

18:10.680 --> 18:12.360
You don't even respect me enough
to tell me.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.840
I do respect you, but we have one fight
and you're leaving.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.560
Only because you're actively
trying to get pregnant by someone else.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.320
I was being logical.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.400
Show me your chest.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.080
-Evan--
-Show me.

18:32.800 --> 18:33.640
[scoffs]

18:34.720 --> 18:35.840
You should've fucked him.

18:36.920 --> 18:37.960
You deserve each other.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.480
And neither of you should be parents.

18:47.920 --> 18:48.840
[sighs]

18:50.200 --> 18:51.040
Ow.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.160
-[Shep chuckles]
-[dog barks]

18:53.600 --> 18:55.760
-Mum! Come on, come on.
-[dog barks]

18:55.840 --> 18:57.480
-[Olive] Bye, Dad.
-[Shep] Bye, sweetie.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.120
The dogs might have the shits tonight

19:04.200 --> 19:06.640
-so I'd give them access to grass.
-How could you do that to me?

19:09.080 --> 19:10.320
Oh.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.520
You mean boyfriend? That done?

19:12.960 --> 19:14.880
Why take something positive from my life?

19:16.160 --> 19:18.760
What is the point
in still trying to hurt me?

19:18.840 --> 19:21.400
Hey, it just came up
and that dude asks a lot of questions.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.160
I respect you in front of your daughter.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.480
-I clean her. I feed her.
-Fucking lettuce.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.640
So why?

19:27.320 --> 19:29.720
Listen. Project Betrayal was your idea.

19:29.800 --> 19:33.160
I felt I had a responsibility
to let the dude know, man to man.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.920
You don't feel responsibility.
You're a worm.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.040
Worms are 100% core strength.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.760
And this is on you.

19:39.840 --> 19:43.280
You tried to fuck me behind
your boyfriend's back and now he's gone.

19:43.360 --> 19:45.520
If you had anything worth taking,
I would take it!

19:49.400 --> 19:51.400
But you don't have anything...
