WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:04.238
Previously on Limitless...
Huston kept notes
on all you guys.

00:04.272 --> 00:05.273
Some sort of burn book.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.208
Whatever dirt he has
on his old colleagues.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.677
Sands killed Rebecca's father.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.612
Why haven't you been
answering my calls?

00:11.645 --> 00:13.747
All I can think about
is how I know

00:13.781 --> 00:15.216
that Sands murdered her dad.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.217
Something's not right.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.351
You think Finch

00:17.385 --> 00:18.419
was selling FBI secrets?

00:18.452 --> 00:19.420
If it involves Jarrod Sands,

00:19.453 --> 00:21.555
it almost definitely involves
Senator Morra.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.757
Yeah, it was Sands, not me.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.626
Sands has Piper, which means

00:25.659 --> 00:27.228
he doesn't work for me anymore.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.262
He's gone rogue.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.233
What is this?
These are for you.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.268
You're gonna put them on,
and then you're gonna tell me

00:34.302 --> 00:36.104
what the hell is going on
between you

00:36.137 --> 00:37.605
and Senator Morra.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.370
Rebecca!

01:09.403 --> 01:10.704
REBECCA:
Hi. My name is Rebecca Harris,

01:10.738 --> 01:14.108
and you're probably wondering
why a bullet is coming my way

01:14.142 --> 01:16.177
at about 1,900 miles an hour.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.711
*

01:17.745 --> 01:20.148
(no voice)

01:20.181 --> 01:22.150
I wasn't raised for gunplay.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.152
In fact, I grew up
in a creative household,

01:24.185 --> 01:26.387
surrounded by art and laughter.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.689
* Hey, hey, can you feel it?

01:28.722 --> 01:31.192
If things had kept going
the way they started,

01:31.225 --> 01:33.694
I'd probably still
be making pictures today.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.696
They didn't, though.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.165
* You turn my head loose...

01:37.198 --> 01:42.336
(high-pitched tone sounding)

01:42.370 --> 01:44.338
His addiction
changed everything.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.340
I had to grow up fast.

01:46.374 --> 01:49.310
* Through all the spaces,
those empty places *

01:49.343 --> 01:51.545
* The corners that cracked...

01:51.579 --> 01:53.481
The the one time
I saw my father

01:53.514 --> 01:56.150
sober up for a spell,
was after his first arrest.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.387
That was the first time

01:59.420 --> 02:02.190
I became fascinated
by the power of a badge.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.757
Now I've got my own.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.560
* Hands down we like,
we like what we like *

02:06.594 --> 02:08.429
* Hands down we like,
we love, we choose you *

02:08.462 --> 02:11.199
* We got an eye,
an eye for what's romance... *

02:11.232 --> 02:12.833
My father's gone,

02:12.866 --> 02:14.168
and as far
as the world was concerned,

02:14.202 --> 02:17.405
he was just another junkie who
floated up in the East River.

02:17.438 --> 02:20.908
But to me, he was the only case
I couldn't close.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.477
In fact, that's how I got here.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.214
Now, as for why there's a
bullet hurtling at my head,

02:26.247 --> 02:29.350
you can start with this guy,
Brian Finch,

02:29.383 --> 02:30.618
my consultant turned friend

02:30.651 --> 02:32.753
who promised
he'd never lie to me.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.488
But apparently,
he's been doing nothing but,

02:34.522 --> 02:36.490
since we started
working together.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.525
It's time.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.228
You've been working
for Senator Morra

02:40.261 --> 02:42.396
against the FBI,
against me,

02:42.430 --> 02:44.532
for, what, as long
as I've known you?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.369
Did he plant you at the CJC?

02:48.402 --> 02:50.571
(scoffs quietly)
No.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.905
So he turned you
after you started?

02:51.939 --> 02:54.342
It's complicated.
Is it?

02:54.375 --> 02:56.344
A presidential candidate
wants someone on the inside,

02:56.377 --> 02:57.811
someone to protect him,

02:57.845 --> 03:00.681
to make sure no one finds
out that he's using NZT,

03:00.714 --> 03:02.883
someone to swap evidence.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.886
Did you kill
the evidence clerk?

03:05.919 --> 03:07.855
Of course not.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.022
"Of course not"?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.926
Brian, how are those words
supposed to mean anything to me?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.562
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.264
I'm not a killer.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.266
I'm not a traitor.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.401
I was forced into this.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.835
They threatened my family.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.438
There's stuff
you don't know about.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.606
So much of it.

03:25.639 --> 03:26.740
You better tell me.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.810
Or we can get an interrogation
room down at the FBI.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.280
What, like, from the very
beginning? I would love to.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.681
I would.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.549
But now is not the time.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.551
There is a woman named Piper
Baird whose life is in danger.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.853
We're talking about you, Brian.
Sands has her.
He's gone rogue from Morra.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.255
Like I said, this has nothing
to do with me.

03:41.289 --> 03:44.658
Sands killed your father.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.395
Does that mean something to you?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.330
Jarrod Sands
killed your father.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.299
I'm sorry, Rebecca,

03:51.332 --> 03:53.334
but it's true.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.742
You're trying to manipulate me.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.782
You're on NZT, aren't you?

04:19.893 --> 04:21.429
(handcuffs tighten)

04:22.563 --> 04:24.932
I just want you to understand
what's going on.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.970
(sighs)

04:33.874 --> 04:36.444
This is your dose for today.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.979
Picked it up on
my way over here.

04:39.012 --> 04:42.015
You've been getting NZT
from Senator Morra,

04:42.049 --> 04:43.884
from the FBI.

04:43.917 --> 04:47.020
You've had me
at a disadvantage for months.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.489
But not today.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.023
Today, I'm gonna be

04:50.057 --> 04:51.258
the smartest person in the room,

04:51.291 --> 04:54.562
and you are gonna tell me every
single thing I want to know.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.930
Rebecca, don't.
You don't have to do that, okay?

04:56.964 --> 04:59.099
Just stop it.
You can trust me.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.902
Yeah, but I don't have to.

05:01.935 --> 05:05.439
I know this comes with
a hell of a hangover,

05:05.473 --> 05:07.307
but at least
it'll get me the truth.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.419
*

05:41.409 --> 05:42.410
(quiet gasp)

05:46.680 --> 05:48.649
(gasps)

05:48.682 --> 05:52.085
(amplified sound
of water dripping)

05:54.855 --> 05:57.391
(amplified sound
of electrical buzzing)

05:57.425 --> 05:58.592
(eyelid fluttering)

05:59.960 --> 06:01.595
(electricity buzzing)

06:01.629 --> 06:03.764
(water gurgling through pipes)

06:04.798 --> 06:06.700
(eyelid flutters)

06:06.734 --> 06:08.902
(water gurgling through pipes)

06:08.936 --> 06:12.406
(wood creaking,
footsteps thudding)

06:16.176 --> 06:17.845
(eyelid jingles)

06:17.878 --> 06:19.947
(swallows)

06:19.980 --> 06:21.849
(inhales)

06:21.882 --> 06:23.784
WOMAN:
...wants a handout these days!
Why would I tip?!

06:23.817 --> 06:26.420
That's the whole point of Uber--
so I don't have to tip!

06:26.454 --> 06:27.855
I should have taken a taxi!

06:28.822 --> 06:32.493
MAN:
It's amazing, isn't it?

06:36.530 --> 06:38.532
Dad?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.138
BRIAN:
It kicked in. I can tell.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.442
(quiet laugh)

06:48.476 --> 06:50.578
First time's always
a little trippy.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.547
You said Sands killed my father.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.848
Tell me everything.

06:56.950 --> 06:57.951
Okay.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.152
(inhales)

06:59.186 --> 07:02.456
I guess, first of all...

07:02.490 --> 07:04.558
I'm not immune
to the side effects of NZT.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.799
Piper Baird has agreed to make
the immunity shot for us.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.567
What turned her?

07:13.601 --> 07:15.769
She has a brother: Max.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.971
She managed to keep
him off Morra's radar.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.840
Well done.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.009
Eight minds are
better than one.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.111
I toured Athon's manufacturing
facility this morning.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.981
Once it's up and running, we'll
have unlimited access to NZT.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.117
All of us.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.787
Till then, all we need
to do is stay underground

07:33.821 --> 07:36.223
and away from Morra.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.661
Why so quiet?

07:40.694 --> 07:44.698
I made a life doing the bidding
of powerful men.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.000
Testing which way
the wind is blowing, finding

07:47.034 --> 07:49.503
the person
who's making the weather.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.939
Never made my own rain before.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.975
Morra didn't leave us
any real choice, did he?

07:55.008 --> 07:56.877
He'd have been
done with us all

07:56.910 --> 07:58.912
as soon as we
stopped being useful.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.083
The others are wondering
about one thing.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.286
Brian Finch.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.822
But you haven't done
the obvious thing.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.293
It looks simple on the face
of it, but it's not.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.529
We've worked together.
He's done things for me.

08:17.598 --> 08:21.735
Every one of us has made
sacrifices to be here.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.771
You brought us
together, Jarrod.

08:23.804 --> 08:24.838
Eyes are on you.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.240
It's no time
to look weak.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.310
We have tracking equipment
in his handler's car.

08:30.343 --> 08:34.715
Grady's ready to
do the job, but...

08:34.748 --> 08:36.784
it's your call.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.122
Then let's take care
of both of them at once.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.964
PSYCHOLOGIST: We're on the verge
of transforming

08:50.998 --> 08:52.666
the science of lie detection.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.934
Why are you watching this?

08:53.967 --> 08:56.069
Because I watched it.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.906
In a controlled study
we recently conducted...

08:58.939 --> 09:00.908
She's talking about something
called the "Pinocchio Effect,"

09:00.941 --> 09:03.276
and on NZT, I can use it to see

09:03.310 --> 09:04.812
if Brian's telling me
the truth.

09:04.845 --> 09:05.979
...primarily around the nose...

09:06.013 --> 09:07.080
If he tells me a lie...

09:07.114 --> 09:09.249
I used to be the touring
guitarist of REO Speedwagon.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.784
...a tiny amount
of blood rushes

09:10.818 --> 09:12.920
from his cheeks to his nose.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.154
The change is too subtle

09:14.187 --> 09:15.923
What?
to detect with the naked eye.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.791
The normal naked eye, that is.

09:17.825 --> 09:18.759
If I don't take that shot,

09:18.792 --> 09:21.729
I get side effects,
just like anybody else.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.697
They've been holding that
over my head.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.599
At first, they just wanted me

09:25.633 --> 09:27.935
to tell them everything
the FBI knows about NZT,

09:27.968 --> 09:31.104
but after that,
it got complicated.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.707
REBECCA:
Once Brian realized
I could do that,

09:33.741 --> 09:35.643
I'm pretty sure
he told me everything.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.910
I switched out Morra's coat

09:36.944 --> 09:38.946
so the blood wouldn't
test positive for NZT.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.213
I did not kill the clerk.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.682
I haven't hurt anybody.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.818
What?

09:44.852 --> 09:46.787
Your nose is growing.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.256
(wry laugh)

09:49.289 --> 09:51.792
It's probably because
I know that's not true.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.794
I hurt you.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.263
Never on purpose, though.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.266
I tried to protect you.

09:59.299 --> 10:02.202
Go on.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.137
I went to Russia to help Piper.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.339
She knows how
to make the immunity shot now,

10:06.373 --> 10:07.808
but Sands has her.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.743
He's teamed up
with a group of people

10:09.777 --> 10:11.078
that used to work with Morra.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.748
And now they're creating
some kind of Legion of Doom.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.050
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you say
"Legion of Doom?"

10:17.084 --> 10:19.419
I did.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.955
And I stand by it.

10:23.824 --> 10:24.825
Is there anything else?

10:29.029 --> 10:30.898
That time your lunch
went missing in the break room--

10:30.931 --> 10:31.965
that was me.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.134
You had it labeled
and everything, but I just...

10:34.167 --> 10:35.435
you know, it was lasagna.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.671
I like lasagna.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.076
You gonna say anything?

10:45.045 --> 10:46.446
You've lied,
and you've committed crimes,

10:46.479 --> 10:48.048
and I don't know if I can
protect you from that.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.850
I don't know if I want to.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.119
This all started because you
wanted to protect your father,

10:52.152 --> 10:55.022
so, you've been in an
impossible position

10:55.055 --> 10:56.857
for months... on the one hand,

10:56.890 --> 10:59.026
we became friends
and on the other,

10:59.059 --> 11:02.462
your job-- your real job--
is to betray me.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.933
The cognitive dissonance
must be overwhelming.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.336
It's a very enlightened
perspective.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.938
If I wasn't on NZT,

11:10.971 --> 11:12.873
I'd probably be pistol-
whipping you right now.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.474
(quiet laugh)

11:14.507 --> 11:17.210
So, does this mean you're gonna
help me find Piper?

11:17.244 --> 11:19.346
No.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.348
It means you're gonna
help me find Sands

11:21.381 --> 11:22.916
and arrest him
for my father's murder.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.952
How did you find this out?

11:24.985 --> 11:27.054
Well, Sands used to work
for a guy named Huston.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.956
He wrote all of this down
just in case

11:28.989 --> 11:30.824
he needed to use it
for blackmail one day.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.460
It's in a book. It's in code,
but I think I cracked it.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.896
I mean, I guess... only the
person who created the code

11:35.929 --> 11:37.164
could say definitively...

11:37.197 --> 11:40.367
So, if I bring this guy Huston
in and I turn him against Sands,

11:40.400 --> 11:42.369
then he could testify
that Sands and Morra

11:42.402 --> 11:44.738
were behind the NZT purge?

11:44.772 --> 11:47.474
Yeah, Huston won't tal...
Or, he-he can't talk.

11:47.507 --> 11:48.976
He's been in a coma for months.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.978
Show me the book.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.880
Well, I had to hide it...

11:52.913 --> 11:55.148
ever since you guys
started doing random searches.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.951
Which made my life
way suckier, by the way,

11:57.985 --> 11:59.519
even though I did deserve it.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.354
McGolrick Park.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.423
You started
running there

12:03.456 --> 12:05.826
after Naz put the
new rules in place,

12:05.859 --> 12:08.528
and you realized that if you
sprinted ahead of your tail,

12:08.561 --> 12:10.397
you'd have
a minute or two, maybe,

12:10.430 --> 12:12.132
where they wouldn't
have their eyes on you.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.167
So you found
a hiding spot.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.336
Not far off the path.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.772
Under a bush?

12:18.806 --> 12:21.041
No...

12:21.074 --> 12:23.343
Under a moderately-sized rock.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.378
Right?

12:28.882 --> 12:31.084
It's not fair.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.085
You. On NZT.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.121
It's not fair.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.093
REBECCA: I wanted to stop and
look around at everything.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.194
At anything.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.063
It was all so beautiful.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.932
But I didn't have time.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.106
So, the guy Brian knows as
Huston wrote the second half

12:53.140 --> 12:55.442
of the burn book,
but the first half of the book

12:55.475 --> 12:57.945
was in different handwriting,
meaning someone else out there

12:57.978 --> 12:59.012
knows the code.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.850
Both authors refer
to an investigator Morra hired:

13:02.883 --> 13:05.085
a woman with the initials A.G.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.461
Brian was looking into
top investigators

13:14.494 --> 13:18.031
who left big agencies around
the time Morra hired A.G.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.067
Yeah, but he's not you.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.501
Morra only hires the best,

13:21.534 --> 13:24.204
so he poached A.G.
from somewhere.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.173
Think of everyone you know
with those initials.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.208
Think government contacts.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.886
Allison Grant is still working
Narcotics with the NYPD.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.521
Aisha Greenwell's a lifer
with the Agency.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.623
Who was that woman
from the cross-agency seminar

13:43.656 --> 13:45.125
in Arlington?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.096
Amelia Glasser.

13:49.129 --> 13:52.032
She was from the DOJ, the office
of the inspector general.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.934
She asked
really intelligent questions

13:53.967 --> 13:55.168
about the Unabomber
investigation.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.504
You looked out for her
the next year.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.372
And then someone
told you she was taking

13:59.406 --> 14:01.408
a seven-figure job
in the private sector.

14:05.946 --> 14:06.980
Where's Brian?

14:07.014 --> 14:08.081
Relax. Brian didn't run.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.183
He's a good guy. Listen.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.920
(light, whimsical music
playing in distance)

14:12.953 --> 14:14.287
Ice cream truck.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.523
BRIAN:
Okay, so...

14:16.556 --> 14:18.658
Amelia Glasser
wins two awards

14:18.691 --> 14:20.994
for exceptional service
at the Department of Justice.

14:21.028 --> 14:24.331
Then she goes to work
in the private sector...

14:24.364 --> 14:26.666
and in 2014...

14:26.699 --> 14:28.668
she just drops off
the grid completely?

14:28.701 --> 14:31.471
So, do you think Sands
and Morra had her killed?

14:31.504 --> 14:32.906
Maybe.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.607
The face looks
familiar, though.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.944
Naz had me dig through
state arrest records,

14:36.977 --> 14:39.579
looking for anything
I could find on NZT.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.315
Um, let me just use
this borrowed password

14:42.349 --> 14:44.351
from the NYPD intranet.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.219
Wow.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.922
There.
Oh, God.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.624
I know. She was booked
under the name Amy Glass

14:51.658 --> 14:53.293
for possession.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.494
It was right after
someone dumped her

14:54.527 --> 14:56.529
in the ER
while she was overdosing.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.031
But they put an address
on the admitting form.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.599
There we are.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.470
We should work
like this all the time.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.478
Still kind of pissed
about the whole treason thing?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.080
That's fair.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.282
(quiet sigh)

15:15.315 --> 15:17.050
You all right?

15:17.084 --> 15:20.687
When you're on NZT,
do you ever see things?

15:20.720 --> 15:23.456
People?
Oh, yeah, all the time.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.125
Sometimes it's me.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.960
Sometimes it's me in a sweater.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.595
Or me in a leather jacket.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.662
I mean, that's just two

15:29.696 --> 15:31.531
slightly different variants.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.666
You know, one time
you showed up as Sloane

15:33.700 --> 15:35.168
from Ferris Bueller's
Day Off.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.369
What does that mean?

15:36.403 --> 15:38.471
Well...

15:38.505 --> 15:40.207
I think it's just
the NZT mind's way

15:40.240 --> 15:43.276
of fragmenting a problem
into deviating perspectives,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.478
embodied by familiar people,

15:45.512 --> 15:46.613
or other nonthreatening
manifestations,

15:46.646 --> 15:49.649
with whom you can interact
to arrive at resolutions,

15:49.682 --> 15:51.084
but I don't know.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.652
I haven't
put much thought into it.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.754
Is there anyone here with you,
like, right now?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.056
Oh, yeah.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.259
Vladimir Lenin's
waiting for us in the back seat.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.095
I'm kidding!
It's Ringo Starr.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.132
(imitates Ringo): He reminds me
to march to beat of my own drum.

16:10.703 --> 16:14.641
WOMAN (slurring):
They told me I could never
talk about what I did.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.277
They told me
they'd take everything.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.313
(scoffs) As if they haven't
done that already.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.751
They hired me to track down

16:24.784 --> 16:27.654
NZT dealers and users.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.489
What else do you want to know?

16:29.522 --> 16:31.224
You reported to
two people

16:31.258 --> 16:33.160
when you worked for
the Morra organization.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.727
Can you tell us
their names?

16:34.761 --> 16:37.630
Well, the first guy
I reported to,

16:37.664 --> 16:40.267
I was supposed to call him
Hawks, and then...

16:40.300 --> 16:42.269
he was replaced by

16:42.302 --> 16:45.172
a guy named Huston.
Yeah, we know
about Huston,

16:45.205 --> 16:48.275
but we're trying to find Hawks.
Can you describe him for us?

16:48.308 --> 16:51.144
I never met him face-to-face.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.414
In case you couldn't tell
by looking at me,

16:54.447 --> 16:57.617
Morra gave me NZT

16:57.650 --> 17:01.254
while I was investigating.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.555
(phone buzzes, chimes)

17:02.589 --> 17:05.492
And, you know, once I suspected

17:05.525 --> 17:07.494
what was happening...

17:07.527 --> 17:10.463
to the people I was finding,

17:10.497 --> 17:12.599
I quit.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.834
And I hoarded some NZT,

17:14.867 --> 17:17.304
but once those, uh,

17:17.337 --> 17:19.606
immunity shots wore off,

17:19.639 --> 17:23.210
then the side effects
took me down.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.845
But once I ran out
of NZT, I...

17:25.878 --> 17:27.780
chased what I could
to numb the pain,

17:27.814 --> 17:29.549
and here we are.

17:31.351 --> 17:35.088
But, you know, I do have
one thing that might help.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.423
I thought I might

17:36.456 --> 17:39.192
need evidence against them...

17:39.226 --> 17:40.493
one day.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.762
(grunting)

17:42.795 --> 17:46.466
Right before I quit,
I followed Hawks

17:46.499 --> 17:49.436
after a dead drop.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.639
And I never got a good look
at him, but I did

17:52.672 --> 17:55.342
pick up a cigarette butt

17:55.375 --> 17:57.377
that he'd ground out.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.314
It's coming.
I'll get it.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.817
There.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.221
Golden Badger--
that's a Japanese brand.

18:08.255 --> 18:12.192
Yeah, so, maybe he's Japanese,
I don't know, but, hey, look,

18:12.225 --> 18:13.760
that's all I got.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.496
Oh, and I never did
run DNA tests,

18:16.529 --> 18:18.131
but if you do,
I mean,

18:18.165 --> 18:20.167
who knows
what you might turn up.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.777
REBECCA: I know this has been
hard for you.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.279
BRIAN: We really appreciate
your help. Thank you.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.482
(phone whistles)

18:45.358 --> 18:46.393
Rebecca, get down!

18:50.963 --> 18:53.333
(grunting)

19:00.340 --> 19:01.808
REBECCA:
So, somebody just shot you.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.109
And you can be sure
of one thing:

19:03.142 --> 19:06.779
whoever pulled that trigger is
drawing another bead right now.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.481
Are you gonna let him
finish the job?

19:18.925 --> 19:20.593
I'm all right.
Where is he?

19:20.627 --> 19:21.861
He's 50 yards that way.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.896
Make sure he's dead.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.567
(grunts)

19:27.600 --> 19:29.736
CONRAD: The bullet pierced
under your clavicle,

19:29.769 --> 19:32.872
then you dislocated
your shoulder on the fall.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.475
The agony you're in...

19:35.508 --> 19:37.210
you don't
have to feel it.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.412
You remember that
from school, right?

19:39.446 --> 19:41.881
The mechanism that controls
pain-- it's all in your brain.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.883
It's just an input
that lets you know

19:43.916 --> 19:45.918
there's been trauma
to your body.

19:45.952 --> 19:46.919
Find it.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.788
Shut it off.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.703
Thanks.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.505
Why are you
doing this--

20:05.538 --> 20:08.841
taking NZT, risking your life?

20:11.911 --> 20:15.982
I left you.

20:16.015 --> 20:19.719
Even before I was actually
gone, I left you.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.255
I don't deserve this.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.424
I didn't do it for you.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.658
You're not doing what for me?

20:25.692 --> 20:27.327
You know what,
don't worry about it.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.595
Okay, I gotta get you
to a hospital.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.330
No, no. I'm okay.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.898
Tag me in.
What?

20:31.931 --> 20:34.867
I don't feel the pain--
the NZT's taking care of that.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.270
You're gonna sew me up
and we're gonna find Hawks.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.038
There is a dead guy
lying in a field over there.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.573
Yeah. We'll call it in
when we can.

20:40.607 --> 20:41.908
I can still use my right hand.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.411
Tag me in.
Dope.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.679
REBECCA:
In exchange for some money,
Amelia Glasser

20:46.713 --> 20:48.848
agreed not to call in
the shooting.

20:48.881 --> 20:49.782
And she'd have to relocate,

20:49.816 --> 20:51.384
now that Sands
knew where she lived.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.652
As for me?

20:52.685 --> 20:55.922
I found myself in the least
likely of operating rooms--

20:55.955 --> 20:58.758
in the hands of someone
whose experience includes

20:58.791 --> 21:00.727
skimming his brother's
med school books

21:00.760 --> 21:02.629
and stitching up
my father's killer.

21:02.662 --> 21:06.032
If I didn't trust Brian before,
I had to now.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.335
(quietly):
Okay.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.503
*

21:10.537 --> 21:11.738
All right, deep breath, okay?

21:11.771 --> 21:15.375
Everything you've said about
Morra and the purge seems true.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.344
But there's just one thing
I can't figure out:

21:17.377 --> 21:19.779
why would Sands send a gunman

21:19.812 --> 21:21.648
and then send
a warning?

21:21.681 --> 21:23.450
Well, we have
a complicated relationship.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.717
More complicated than ours?

21:24.751 --> 21:26.486
No. Now, can you stop talking?

21:26.519 --> 21:28.421
Brian, just do it.
I don't feel any pain.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.523
(wry laugh) I can't believe
you didn't figure that out.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.591
Well, if you're so smart,

21:31.624 --> 21:33.826
you want to pop your own
shoulder back into place?

21:33.860 --> 21:36.329
See, this is why we
make such a great team.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.798
Okay, here we go.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.904
Oh.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.006
And we were off
to figure out if the DNA

21:47.039 --> 21:51.077
on that cigarette butt
matched anyone in our records.

21:51.110 --> 21:54.447
Which meant we had to duck.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.487
Hey. Let me get that.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.655
Okay. Clear your mind, focus on

22:02.689 --> 22:04.090
(exhaling)
your pain control, okay?

22:05.992 --> 22:07.827
I'm the one that figured it out.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.862
What's this?

22:09.896 --> 22:11.731
The lab kicked back
preliminary results

22:11.764 --> 22:14.100
on the DNA from
the cigarette-- no match.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.935
(sighs)
That sucks.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.937
But at least
they gave you a giant binder.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.939
We're not taking
"no match" for an answer.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.574
Whoever Hawks is,
if he's the one

22:21.608 --> 22:23.109
that wrote the other half
of that book,

22:23.142 --> 22:24.711
he's the only one
that can testify

22:24.744 --> 22:25.878
that Sands killed my father.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.981
(quietly): Right.
That's just the raw
report on his DNA.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.117
There are 27 other binders

22:31.150 --> 22:33.620
just like it,
down in the file room.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.722
There's just a bunch
of random letters.

22:35.755 --> 22:38.425
No.
No?

22:38.458 --> 22:41.528
This is the genetic code for
the man that we're looking for.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.865
Sorry.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.099
The Bureau sends us
to Quantico

22:47.133 --> 22:48.134
once a year,
for on-the-job training.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.837
Mm.
Last time I was there,
I went to a seminar

22:50.870 --> 22:54.006
on DNA sequencing,
taught by Riccardo Sabatini.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.577
There are three billion
base pairs in the human genome.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.612
He's zeroed in
on the five million

22:59.646 --> 23:02.649
that are responsible
for our identifying traits.
Oh.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.183
Just five million.
He knows

23:04.216 --> 23:08.154
which pairs determine height,
weight, eye color, skin tone.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.889
Mm.
If we sort through these,

23:09.922 --> 23:11.691
we can figure out
what Hawks looks like.

23:11.724 --> 23:15.462
If we know what he looks like,
we can figure out who he is.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.498
Well... (laughs)

23:18.531 --> 23:19.899
I don't know the last time
you checked a clock,

23:19.932 --> 23:21.834
but I kind of turned back

23:21.868 --> 23:23.636
into a pumpkin about
an hour ago.
Brian?

23:23.670 --> 23:25.438
Yeah.
I know.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.574
Oh, good.
I told Ike
we were pulling an all-nighter,

23:27.607 --> 23:29.542
so we were able
to clear another pill.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.611
I'm good for another six hours.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.915
All right.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.917
Five million base pairs.

23:37.950 --> 23:41.454
(whispering):
In a haystack of three billion.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.089
At least there's two of us.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.857
Carry my books for me?
Yep. You got it.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.126
(clears throat)

23:47.159 --> 23:49.862
REBECCA: I'd always wondered
what it was like for Brian,

23:49.896 --> 23:52.064
when he was on NZT.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.467
I figured he felt numb,
like a human calculator.

23:54.501 --> 23:57.504
I was wrong.
Every part of you feels alive,

23:57.537 --> 23:59.672
open... the air crackles
with information.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.173
You breathe it
like it's oxygen.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.676
It's as if you'd been running
with weights on

24:03.710 --> 24:06.012
for your entire life, and
suddenly, you took them off,

24:06.045 --> 24:08.715
and this was the way
you always were meant to be.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.783
I knew now
why it was so addicting.

24:13.853 --> 24:14.821
(sighs)

24:14.854 --> 24:15.855
Whew!

24:15.888 --> 24:17.557
It's pretty wild, right?

24:17.590 --> 24:18.958
(sighs)

24:18.991 --> 24:22.495
So we've got a six-foot tall man
of Finnish descent.

24:22.529 --> 24:26.198
I know, but if we actually want
to see what Hawks looks like,

24:26.232 --> 24:27.934
I got a plan.
Me, too.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.702
You go first.
Okay, so CRAFT.

24:29.736 --> 24:32.104
They have these badass
3-D printers, right?

24:32.138 --> 24:35.842
With this list of traits, plus
some tweaking to their software,

24:35.875 --> 24:38.945
we could actually print a copy
of Hawks, run that

24:38.978 --> 24:41.748
through the...
That would be great,
except for a really awkward date

24:41.781 --> 24:43.783
that I had with Quentin
a little while back,

24:43.816 --> 24:45.117
so,

24:45.151 --> 24:47.787
maybe we don't have to ask them
for any favors?

24:47.820 --> 24:49.656
I was actually
thinking that...
What?!

24:49.689 --> 24:51.591
You went on a date with Quentin?

24:51.624 --> 24:52.859
(sighs)

24:52.892 --> 24:55.027
Does this mean we can't go
to CRAFT ever again?

24:55.061 --> 24:56.195
Clock is ticking, Brian.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.697
(sighs)

24:57.730 --> 24:59.932
All right, fine.
What's your idea?

24:59.966 --> 25:02.134
James Tech.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.604
(keyboarding)
So now we just run this baby

25:04.637 --> 25:05.872
through facial recognition.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.540
Make sure you give it a range

25:07.574 --> 25:08.608
for height,
weight and age.

25:08.641 --> 25:09.742
We can't be sure how accurate

25:09.776 --> 25:10.910
it is.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.545
Oh, it'll be pretty accurate.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.881
Hey, it's not this guy's
first rodeo.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.315
Clearly you guys know
what you're doing.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.017
I'm gonna get a cup of decaf.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.656
NAZ:
Rebecca?
Mm.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.625
What are you all working on?

25:25.658 --> 25:28.294
Leads. It's a case
Cyber asked me

25:28.327 --> 25:30.229
to look in on.
What happened?

25:30.262 --> 25:31.664
You bleeding?

25:33.199 --> 25:35.167
Oh, no, I just
spilled something.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.804
On your shoulder?
Barbecue.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.238
Brian dragged me to a smokehouse

25:39.271 --> 25:41.774
in the Lower East Side.
It was... messy.

25:41.808 --> 25:42.842
BRIAN:
Hey.

25:42.875 --> 25:43.976
We got a hit.
Oh, great.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.912
We'll let you know
when something pans out.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.914
You got a little...
Sauce. I know.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.015
Yeah.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.954
BRIAN:
Whoa. Nice place, Hawks.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.689
REBECCA:
Well, AKA Timothy Aalto.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.124
Mr. Aalto to you.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.593
This place must cost tens
of millions of dollars.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.995
Pretty impressive, hiding in
plain sight on Park Avenue.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.864
Or maybe we got it wrong.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.734
On most days, I might share
your concerns, but not today.

26:07.767 --> 26:08.768
Right.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.370
All we have to do is get
him to come to the CJC.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.272
Don't show him the burn
book until we're there.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.774
I'll take care of the rest.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.650
HOUSEKEEPER:
Mr. Aalto doesn't like to have
his workouts interrupted.

26:23.683 --> 26:26.085
REBECCA: We'll try not
to keep him too long.

26:28.154 --> 26:29.155
Oh, my God!

26:30.389 --> 26:31.824
REBECCA:
Call 911.

26:36.763 --> 26:37.630
He's gone.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.371
EMS is calling it a widowmaker--

26:45.404 --> 26:47.239
an exertion-induced coronary.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.808
There's no indication
of it being anything else?

26:48.841 --> 26:50.409
Oh, do you want
to go ask them that?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.845
I say we accept
"massive heart attack"

26:52.879 --> 26:54.213
and be on our way.
But this was Sands.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.381
Of course it was.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.582
But I've already had to lie

26:56.615 --> 26:59.085
about why a federal agent showed
up at this particular door

26:59.118 --> 27:00.853
just in time to see Hawks dead.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.122
How did you do that?

27:03.155 --> 27:05.291
I paid the housekeeper
to say that she was outside

27:05.324 --> 27:06.425
flagging people down just as

27:06.458 --> 27:07.994
we were passing by
on our way uptown.

27:08.027 --> 27:11.297
Did you see Hawks's left arm?

27:11.330 --> 27:14.366
Just inside the elbow--
the shade was a color off.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.403
Like, injection-marks off?
It was subtle.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.939
Must have been a tiny needle,
intradermal maybe.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.775
Maybe it was chloroform,
in which case, if the M.E.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.143
isn't looking for that mark,
then it's gonna look

27:24.176 --> 27:25.411
like natural causes.

27:25.444 --> 27:26.879
Well, do you want to say
something? I mean...

27:26.913 --> 27:28.280
Do you want to spend
the rest of the day

27:28.314 --> 27:29.481
in an interrogation room?

27:29.515 --> 27:33.052
No. I say we stay on target,
fix what we can when we're done.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.353
Yeah. Still need somebody

27:34.386 --> 27:36.455
to fill in the blanks
of the burn book.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.391
Yeah, which leaves Huston.

27:39.425 --> 27:42.061
Yeah. Languishing
in a vegetative state,

27:42.094 --> 27:43.429
completely incapacitated.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.865
Other than that,
totally our guy.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.468
What?

27:49.501 --> 27:53.940
What if we, um... you know?

27:55.207 --> 27:56.876
Capacitate him?

28:03.115 --> 28:05.384
Sands said he got in
a giant car accident,

28:05.417 --> 28:07.353
then a massive stroke
in the hospital.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.989
Like a real stroke, or the kind
Jarrod Sands gives you?

28:10.022 --> 28:10.990
I doubt it.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.458
Sands didn't
want to kill him.

28:12.491 --> 28:15.127
Huston pulled him up from
rock bottom, he saved his life.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.063
Well, we can't
rule anything out.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.230
Maybe there's something about

28:18.264 --> 28:19.799
his medical history
in the burn book.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.333
You still have it?
Mm-hmm.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.102
(beeps accelerate
briefly)

28:25.004 --> 28:26.338
Brian?
Yeah.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.474
His heart rate.
What?

28:28.507 --> 28:30.910
When I said "burn book,"
it spiked.

28:30.943 --> 28:33.212
Not through the roof,
but it accelerated.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.514
(steady beeping)

28:35.547 --> 28:37.083
Are you sure?

28:37.116 --> 28:39.051
Yes. He reacted.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.089
(sighs)

28:43.122 --> 28:45.491
Huston, can you hear us?

28:45.524 --> 28:48.227
Can you open
your eyes, or...

28:48.260 --> 28:50.396
lift a finger or something?

29:02.508 --> 29:05.845
You know, a lot of
people have died,

29:05.878 --> 29:08.314
and a lot more people
are going to die,

29:08.347 --> 29:12.051
if the contents of
this book stay secret.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.990
This is the exception
to the rule.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.992
He gave me the life that
I've got today, which is why

29:20.026 --> 29:22.895
I'm so loath to end his.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.432
He can hear us.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.401
He understands.
What do you see?

29:29.435 --> 29:31.337
His eyes.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.173
He was doing this the last
time I was here with Sands.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.243
But his eyes
were only moving

29:37.276 --> 29:40.012
when specific things were said,
things Sands was saying.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.580
It's really subtle,

29:41.613 --> 29:44.016
and I don't think
you could interpret a pattern.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.185
And if he can't blink out
"yes" or "no,"

29:46.218 --> 29:47.386
how are we gonna communicate?

29:47.419 --> 29:48.520
We're gonna have to...
Ah-ah!

29:48.554 --> 29:51.123
Don't say it.
What?

29:52.158 --> 29:54.026
You were gonna say
"read his mind."

29:54.060 --> 29:56.528
And then you were gonna say
"literally,"

29:56.562 --> 29:58.564
but I'm gonna get to work.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.401
REBECCA: The doctors who
initially treated Huston

30:02.434 --> 30:05.537
misdiagnosed him as being in
a persistent vegetative state.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.507
Brian's hunch is that
Huston suffers from a condition

30:08.540 --> 30:10.442
called Locked-In Syndrome,

30:10.476 --> 30:12.912
essentially a
private hell of lucid awareness

30:12.945 --> 30:14.413
with zero body control.

30:14.446 --> 30:17.884
If Brian is right, all we need
is an EEG machine.

30:17.917 --> 30:21.187
And that is gonna take
circuitry, computer chips,

30:21.220 --> 30:23.522
capacitors, resistors,
connectors, electrodes.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.591
We found most of what we needed
at Huston's place.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.126
And the rest,
we managed to scrounge up

30:27.159 --> 30:28.594
from personal stocks.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.262
Okay. Eight electrodes.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.965
It may be not the most thorough
EEG device ever made,

30:32.999 --> 30:34.300
but it'll do.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.601
Should we test it out?

30:36.635 --> 30:38.237
(sighs)
What, like, on me?

30:38.270 --> 30:40.439
(scoffs) Look, as fascinating
as it may be

30:40.472 --> 30:43.275
to see NZT brainwaves,
Huston's got dibs.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.512
Hey, heading out.
Need anything?
Come in.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.247
Uh, shut the door, please.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.149
Have a seat.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.483
What's going on?

30:51.517 --> 30:54.120
Have you seen
Agent Harris today?

30:54.153 --> 30:55.621
Oh, heard she was around,

30:55.654 --> 30:58.224
but, uh, somehow our paths
never crossed. Why?

30:58.257 --> 31:01.260
She's up to something--
something involving Finch.

31:01.293 --> 31:04.563
Well, if she is,
must be a good reason.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.365
It's Rebecca.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.367
I'm gonna ask you something
point blank.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.601
Okay, shoot.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.503
Have you ever known her
to take NZT?

31:11.537 --> 31:14.506
What?

31:14.540 --> 31:15.975
No, not at all.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.443
I've never thought I'd have

31:17.476 --> 31:19.145
to worry about this,
but earlier on,

31:19.178 --> 31:20.379
she was acting very strangely.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.048
And then, she and Finch

31:22.081 --> 31:24.150
sorted through a mountain
of work twice as fast

31:24.183 --> 31:26.152
as Brian could alone.
Oh, that seems
like thin evidence.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.254
No. I think she had a gash
in her shoulder.

31:28.287 --> 31:30.656
If so, she was in no condition
to be here.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.191
Now, you can call me paranoid,

31:32.224 --> 31:33.659
but after what happened
with Casey,

31:33.692 --> 31:35.594
and considering
her relationship with him...

31:35.627 --> 31:38.931
Yes, ma'am. I get it.
You can't be too careful.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.599
But it's Rebecca.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.368
I can't imagine
her doing something like that.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.136
Well, let's hope not.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.138
I mean, given her family history
of addiction,

31:46.172 --> 31:48.207
she should truly be
the last person

31:48.240 --> 31:49.608
to try that drug.

31:49.641 --> 31:52.178
(monitor beeping steadily)

31:55.047 --> 31:57.449
Fair warning: even though
I may have studied up

31:57.483 --> 31:59.585
on my YouTube
electroencephalography skills,

31:59.618 --> 32:01.320
I am still, by no means,
an expert.

32:01.353 --> 32:02.654
However, I should be able

32:02.688 --> 32:04.323
to interpret the waveforms
of at least

32:04.356 --> 32:06.292
binary responses,
so that's left and right,

32:06.325 --> 32:08.227
yes and no,
stuff like that.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.529
Well, assuming there are
waveforms to interpret at all.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.032
I mean, the eye movements could
have been involuntary twitches.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.067
Let's find out.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.707
(switches click)

32:24.043 --> 32:25.177
Did you plug it in?

32:27.079 --> 32:28.080
(monitor beeps steadily)

32:32.384 --> 32:34.020
It's because we moved it.

32:35.354 --> 32:38.257
(whirring)

32:38.290 --> 32:40.326
Is it supposed to be doing that?

32:42.228 --> 32:43.462
Yeah, kind of.

32:43.495 --> 32:44.630
What do you mean, "kind of"?

32:45.731 --> 32:48.134
Huston, can you understand
what we're saying right now?

32:48.167 --> 32:50.036
(wry chuckle)
Feel like I'm talking to NASA.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.306
You know, I was just thinking...

32:54.340 --> 32:56.075
even if he can
tell us something,

32:56.108 --> 32:57.576
will he?

32:57.609 --> 32:59.145
I mean, he and Sands
were pretty close.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.712
He might not
want to flip on his friend.

33:00.746 --> 33:02.348
Well, right now,
we're the only ones that know

33:02.381 --> 33:05.751
there's a Huston
locked away in that body.

33:05.784 --> 33:08.054
So, if he wants
the rest of the world to know,

33:08.087 --> 33:10.189
he'll help me lock away the man
that killed my father.

33:10.222 --> 33:11.490
(two beeps)

33:14.726 --> 33:17.029
That looks like a yes to me.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.764
Oh, that's more than a yes.

33:18.797 --> 33:21.400
He's talking to us.

33:30.509 --> 33:31.510
REBECCA:
Even with such a crude tool,

33:31.543 --> 33:33.345
Brian was able
to winnow down the patterns

33:33.379 --> 33:34.613
and interpret Huston's
responses

33:34.646 --> 33:35.581
to our questions.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.084
It was almost like
a real conversation.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.389
So you're the one
who coded the book?

33:43.422 --> 33:44.423
Yes.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.591
This is your handwriting?

33:45.624 --> 33:47.593
No.
Half of it is.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.428
Aalto wrote the other half?

33:49.461 --> 33:50.496
Yes.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.830
President George...

33:51.863 --> 33:54.333
REBECCA: So it wasn't the most
eloquent of conversations.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.369
But we didn't need to leverage
Huston with threats.

33:59.671 --> 34:01.673
Whether it was a need to repent

34:01.707 --> 34:04.710
or gratitude to finally have
company in his silent prison,

34:04.743 --> 34:06.645
Huston was more than willing
to help us.

34:06.678 --> 34:09.148
And you'd be willing to
testify to all this in court?

34:09.181 --> 34:11.483
Including that it was Jarrod
Sands that killed my father?

34:11.517 --> 34:12.351
(blipping, beeping)

34:12.384 --> 34:15.654
He can do that, right?
Testify?

34:15.687 --> 34:17.789
If we can get an expert witness

34:17.823 --> 34:19.591
to corroborate the results
of the FMRI,

34:19.625 --> 34:22.694
preferably not a homemade one--
we have a witness.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.331
Now we just need
to lure out Sands.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.109
I'm always down
for extreme measures.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.810
I mean, what do you
got in mind?

34:38.844 --> 34:41.613
Drone strike?
Swatting?

34:41.647 --> 34:43.849
Henry Watkins.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.218
Sands would do anything
to protect his son.

34:46.252 --> 34:47.419
It's his only weakness
that we're aware of.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.256
Our only option
is to take him.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.557
Wait, what?!

34:51.590 --> 34:53.292
We can't take a kid.

34:53.325 --> 34:55.161
Why not?
He took your friend Piper.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.428
Because we're not him.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.197
You're not him.

34:59.565 --> 35:03.502
Look, I think we're losing
sight of the problem here,

35:03.535 --> 35:06.172
and this win-at-all costs
mentality...

35:06.205 --> 35:07.639
I mean, that's
what happened to Casey.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.175
That's what happened
to Eddie Morra.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.542
You think that's what's
happening to me?

35:10.576 --> 35:13.312
(sighs) You are talking
about kidnapping.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.713
Why are you protecting Sands?

35:14.746 --> 35:16.315
I'm not.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.184
If anyone, I'm protecting you.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.619
I can't bring the FBI
in on this.

35:20.652 --> 35:23.289
I need you here.
I need you on board.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.762
(sighs heavily)

35:30.796 --> 35:32.464
It's, like,
11:00 p.m., so...

35:32.498 --> 35:33.665
we have an hour.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.634
We have to move on this.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.237
Show me where his son lives.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.676
BOYLE:
Drop your weapon!

36:17.709 --> 36:19.711
There's no way out.

36:19.745 --> 36:23.315
Mr. Sands, there's more
SWAT than you can kill.

36:23.349 --> 36:24.983
I'm asking you
for the last time--

36:25.016 --> 36:27.653
drop your weapon.

36:29.455 --> 36:30.856
Now!

36:38.430 --> 36:39.531
REBECCA:
Your mistake was assuming

36:39.565 --> 36:41.433
that you got there before us.

36:41.467 --> 36:44.303
And assuming you were
ahead of us at any point today.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.238
Our plan wouldn't have worked
if you hadn't bugged

36:46.272 --> 36:48.640
my apartment,
so thank you for that.

36:48.674 --> 36:51.943
It was near-flawless
installation.

36:53.812 --> 36:57.783
High-end micro cameras.
Must've been there for weeks.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.488
Luckily, today,
I was more on my game.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.297
I cooked up the story
about the kidnapping,

37:11.330 --> 37:12.831
I filled Brian in
on the way to my apartment,

37:12.864 --> 37:15.501
then we fed it to you through
your own surveillance equipment.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.536
Then we just sat back

37:17.569 --> 37:19.471
and waited for you
to collect your son.

37:19.505 --> 37:20.839
Who's fine,

37:20.872 --> 37:22.308
by the way.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.278
Bit of a leap,
all this, isn't it?

37:26.312 --> 37:29.014
Interrogating a man
for visiting his son.

37:29.047 --> 37:32.818
Attempting to link it to
your poor home security?

37:32.851 --> 37:34.886
You don't have
anything to hold me.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.489
Well, we do have a testimony
from your old pal Huston.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.459
It's a crazy story.

37:40.492 --> 37:41.993
He says hi, by the way.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.596
Meantime?

37:44.630 --> 37:47.866
You're gonna tell us where
you've keeping Piper Baird.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.302
I have no idea
who that is, mate.

37:50.336 --> 37:52.338
What about Conrad Harris?

37:52.371 --> 37:55.474
My father.

37:55.507 --> 37:58.009
A man whose life you took,
like so many others,

37:58.043 --> 37:59.745
during what
you and the Morra operation

37:59.778 --> 38:02.481
refer to as "The Purge."

38:02.514 --> 38:05.484
Again, no idea.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.953
My father was a painter.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.455
He was a junkie.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.956
He was... nothing.

38:10.989 --> 38:11.990
He was nothing

38:12.023 --> 38:13.925
to you.
Rebecca...

38:13.959 --> 38:16.462
No, I want to understand--
why was he such a threat?

38:16.495 --> 38:19.465
Why did he have to die?

38:19.498 --> 38:21.500
I didn't know your father.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.769
But if I was to guess...

38:23.802 --> 38:26.505
maybe he was just a junkie.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.774
Or maybe he started dealing.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.877
Started to discover
the possibilities.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.045
Just as I believe
you have, Agent Harris.

38:34.079 --> 38:37.549
If there was a purge,
if Morra was behind it,

38:37.583 --> 38:38.884
if he got someone

38:38.917 --> 38:42.087
to snuff out your father...

38:42.120 --> 38:45.524
doesn't mean your dad
was burning bright.

38:45.557 --> 38:49.094
Only means there was a chance
he could have.

38:50.962 --> 38:54.400
Just like his daughter, yeah?

38:58.804 --> 39:01.373
Rot in hell, Sands.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.579
(knocks twice)

39:07.613 --> 39:09.080
(door opens)

39:17.155 --> 39:18.890
Hey, Rebecca?

39:18.924 --> 39:20.559
Hold on a sec.

39:20.592 --> 39:21.693
You okay?

39:21.727 --> 39:24.863
He didn't come back.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.467
My Dad.
You said that you see people

39:28.500 --> 39:30.636
to help you work
things out, but...

39:30.669 --> 39:32.438
he didn't come back.

39:32.471 --> 39:35.874
Well, maybe you
figured it out yourself.

39:35.907 --> 39:39.144
And we did perform
some minor miracles today.

39:39.177 --> 39:40.546
We talked to the nearly dead.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.981
We took down an ex-MI6.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.450
Not too shabby.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.984
Anything else you want to

39:46.017 --> 39:47.553
knock off your
bucket list real quick?

39:47.586 --> 39:49.621
Naz is waiting for me.

39:49.655 --> 39:52.123
Yeah. Hey, um...

39:52.157 --> 39:54.460
before we go in there,

39:54.493 --> 39:56.662
I just want
to say thank you.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.697
For everything.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.167
You helped put my father's
murderer behind bars.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.169
I should be thanking you.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.972
Uh, putting all
the lying, deception

40:07.005 --> 40:08.474
and treason aside...

40:08.507 --> 40:09.908
Yeah, I don't think
Naz'll do that.

40:09.941 --> 40:12.077
Well, we'll work something out.
Maybe you'll be an informant

40:12.110 --> 40:13.479
or something.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.681
I can't.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.916
I can't stay.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.024
H-How did I miss this?

40:26.057 --> 40:27.826
You were so focused on Sands.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.028
Look, this happens to me
all the time.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.663
Just 'cause you're on NZT,

40:31.697 --> 40:33.231
you can't see what
you're not looking for.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.034
Your immunity.

40:36.067 --> 40:36.868
You gave up Sands,

40:36.902 --> 40:40.005
you came clean
about Morra, you...

40:40.038 --> 40:42.140
you sacrificed
your connection to him,

40:42.173 --> 40:44.142
to the immunity shot.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.845
You sacrificed
all of that for me?

40:46.878 --> 40:49.915
As I said.

40:49.948 --> 40:52.818
You can't take NZT anymore.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.486
That's okay.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.555
But my days here
are numbered. I don't know

40:56.588 --> 40:59.024
exactly how long
the booster shot's gonna last.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.192
Well, Naz isn't gonna risk
you taking a pill without it.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.829
Brian...

41:03.862 --> 41:06.164
we should have found Piper.

41:06.197 --> 41:08.667
But now...

41:08.700 --> 41:09.901
If you're starting to feel that,

41:09.935 --> 41:11.537
it must mean
your pill's wearing off,

41:11.570 --> 41:14.205
and you need to go see a
real doctor, like, now.
Brian.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.742
Just go. I got this.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.544
Who knows?

41:18.577 --> 41:20.912
Maybe Naz'll keep
me on as a janitor.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.981
I mean, that is the only
job that I'm technically

41:23.014 --> 41:24.683
qualified for
without NZT.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.752
And Stavros is getting
a little long in the tooth.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.787
Just sayin'.

41:31.957 --> 41:33.258
He's a good kid.

41:33.291 --> 41:36.695
I can see why
you'd like him.

41:36.728 --> 41:39.631
Even when he was stuck
between a rock and a hard place,

41:39.665 --> 41:42.701
he did what he could
to stand by you.

41:42.734 --> 41:46.004
It's more than I can say
for myself.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.974
Why are you here?

41:49.007 --> 41:51.176
To... tell you
to say no to drugs?

41:54.179 --> 41:55.781
And I'm proud of you.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.853
And to let you know
it's not your fault.

42:03.154 --> 42:05.223
Nothing you said or did,

42:05.256 --> 42:07.926
nothing would have
changed what happened.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.831
Some people aren't meant
to stay in your life.

42:15.066 --> 42:18.604
But that doesn't mean
they can't stay with you.

42:20.772 --> 42:22.941
Are you talking about yourself

42:22.974 --> 42:24.976
