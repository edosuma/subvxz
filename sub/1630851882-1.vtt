01:48.775 --> 01:50.151
It is time.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.564
It's beautiful, isn't it?

02:28.648 --> 02:30.233
I'm Ikaris.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.569
I'm Sersi.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.099
Thank you, Ajak.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.997
Shit.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.378
Excuse me. Excuse me.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.065
I know I'm late, Charlie.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.114
"In this broad Earth of ours,

08:10.281 --> 08:13.618
"Amid the measureless
grossness and the slag,

08:13.784 --> 08:16.996
"Enclosed and safe
within its central heart,

08:17.163 --> 08:19.749
"Nestles the seed Perfection."

08:20.583 --> 08:23.503
The poet's hope and optimism in humanity

08:23.669 --> 08:26.088
echoes our recent universal victory,

08:26.172 --> 08:28.132
the return of half our population...

08:28.216 --> 08:29.550
And, thank God, there she is.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.720
Our brilliant museum scientist, Ms. Sersi,

08:32.803 --> 08:34.222
the person who will be

08:34.305 --> 08:35.973
and was always supposed to be

08:36.057 --> 08:37.892
giving you your presentation today.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.811
Thank you, Mr. Whitman.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.772
Today, we'll be learning
about the importance

08:42.855 --> 08:45.816
of apex predators in a balanced ecosystem.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.152
Poetry?

08:48.319 --> 08:49.654
I completely
ran out of things to say,

08:49.737 --> 08:51.864
and these kids make me nervous.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.242
Well, I thought you were
very charming, Professor.

08:54.825 --> 08:55.868
See you tonight.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.663
-Ooh! "See you tonight."

08:58.746 --> 09:00.414
All right, settle down.

09:02.917 --> 09:03.918
So...

09:04.377 --> 09:06.796
who can tell me
what an apex predator is?

09:07.255 --> 09:08.965
Animals that hunt their prey for food.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.299
Very good.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.802
Apex predators do hunt
their prey for food,

09:12.885 --> 09:14.136
like all predators.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.138
But one thing that sets them apart

09:16.305 --> 09:18.891
is that there are no other
animals in their habitat

09:18.975 --> 09:20.935
strong enough to hunt them.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.563
Who can give me an example?

09:23.646 --> 09:24.689
Lions.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.607
-Wolves.
-Correct.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.444
Earthquake.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.865
-Get down. Get down!

09:35.032 --> 09:37.702
It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

09:39.036 --> 09:42.039
Let me help you.
Don't worry, it'll pass soon.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.008
-It's all right. Come here.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.137
You're all right. You're all right.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.681
I like this song.

10:40.765 --> 10:41.932
Me, too.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.310
Do you wanna dance?

10:45.269 --> 10:46.437
Wait, what the hell?

10:47.396 --> 10:48.606
Your hand!

10:49.357 --> 10:53.194
You've had too much to drink. I gotta go.

10:58.324 --> 11:02.745
Happy birthday to you

11:02.912 --> 11:07.917
Happy birthday, dear Dane

11:08.084 --> 11:12.046
Happy birthday to you

11:12.213 --> 11:14.131
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

11:14.215 --> 11:17.176
(STAY IN THE GROOVE PT. 1

11:17.259 --> 11:18.344
PLAYING ON SPEAKER)

11:21.305 --> 11:22.807
Is this from the Middle Ages?

11:22.890 --> 11:24.183
It has your family crest.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.644
It must have cost a fortune.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.646
I'm a good eBay bidder.

11:28.729 --> 11:29.730
Thank you.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.691
Happy birthday.

11:35.277 --> 11:38.197
So, have you given any more thought

11:38.280 --> 11:39.990
to us moving in together?

11:40.074 --> 11:42.284
Yeah, I... I thought about it.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.538
I can't move in with you.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.540
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Thought you'd say that.

11:47.623 --> 11:48.666
I'm sorry.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.127
And I think I know why.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.505
Are you a wizard?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.006
What?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.175
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.260
No. I'm...

11:59.427 --> 12:00.636
I've noticed some unusual things happen

12:00.720 --> 12:01.721
when I'm around you.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.848
Like our water always turns to coffee

12:03.931 --> 12:04.932
whenever the waiter ignores us.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.100
That's your caffeine addiction talking.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.061
-And Sprite says things...
-Mm.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.688
...like you and your ex-boyfriend

12:10.771 --> 12:12.189
broke up a century ago.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.816
She said that?

12:13.983 --> 12:15.192
And he can fly.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.278
He's a pilot.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.905
Get a room, you two.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.491
Can we go now? It's past my bedtime.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.956
Are you really in love?

12:29.123 --> 12:30.374
What if I am?

12:30.541 --> 12:32.710
You better tell him
the truth, then.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.503
I'm working on it.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.475
You guys wanna get pizza?

12:47.641 --> 12:48.893
No, thank you!

12:50.853 --> 12:53.230
He won't live forever, you know.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.315
Move in with him.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.192
I live with you.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.612
Dane.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.200
Shit! Is that a Deviant?

13:04.366 --> 13:05.993
Dane, run!

13:17.463 --> 13:18.631
-Sersi?
-Let's go.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.718
-What is that thing?
-A Deviant!

13:22.885 --> 13:24.053
You said you killed them all!

13:24.220 --> 13:25.221
You told him that?

13:25.387 --> 13:26.972
-You believed me?
-I do now!

13:33.687 --> 13:35.314
What are you doing?

13:35.397 --> 13:36.524
Keep Dane safe!

13:36.607 --> 13:38.484
Sersi, wait! What?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.077
You're fine, dude.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.370
Sprite!

13:54.583 --> 13:56.502
No. Stairs.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.208
Run! Go! Go!

14:36.375 --> 14:37.751
- Go!
- Come on!

14:45.426 --> 14:46.802
It knows where we are!

14:46.927 --> 14:48.053
How?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.180
I don't know!

14:51.140 --> 14:52.141
Sprite!

14:58.230 --> 14:59.231
Sprite!

15:18.417 --> 15:19.501
Ikaris!

15:21.128 --> 15:22.588
Evening, ladies.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.507
Watch out!

15:41.690 --> 15:42.983
Wizard.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.863
Sorry.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.970
Did it just heal itself?

16:30.364 --> 16:31.573
Ikaris.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.244
It's good to see you.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.538
It's good to see you, too, Sprite.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.546
I'm Dane.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.131
Hello, Dane.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.842
Well, I guess you must be the pilot.

17:03.313 --> 17:06.483
We're Eternals,
from a planet called Olympia.

17:07.234 --> 17:10.154
We came here 7,000 years ago on the Domo,

17:10.320 --> 17:13.741
our starship, to protect
humans from the Deviants.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.202
We thought we killed them all
five centuries ago,

17:17.286 --> 17:18.912
but now they're back.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.374
Look, if you don't
want to move in with me,

17:22.458 --> 17:23.459
you could just say.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.044
Dane, this is serious.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.795
Oh, I know. I'm just still getting

17:26.879 --> 17:28.213
over the fact you're not a wizard.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.382
I was hoping you could
change me into a giraffe.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.259
I always wanted to be
a giraffe when I was a kid.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.595
It's too bad I can't change
sentient beings.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.013
You would have made a very cute giraffe.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.187
Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?

17:43.479 --> 17:44.772
Or any war?

17:44.855 --> 17:46.565
Or all the other terrible things
throughout history?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.067
We were instructed

17:48.150 --> 17:49.443
not to interfere in any human conflicts

17:49.526 --> 17:50.527
unless Deviants were involved.

17:50.694 --> 17:51.904
Why?

17:52.071 --> 17:55.866
If we'd protected humanity
from everything

17:55.949 --> 17:57.284
for 7,000 years,

17:57.367 --> 17:59.536
you'd never have had
the chance to develop

17:59.620 --> 18:01.413
in the way you were meant to.

18:01.497 --> 18:05.709
But if the Deviants were
eradicated a long time ago,

18:05.793 --> 18:07.252
why are you still here?

18:07.336 --> 18:08.420
We've been waiting...

18:08.879 --> 18:10.923
to be told we can go home.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.967
So...

18:14.802 --> 18:16.011
Ikaris.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.764
The boy who flew too close to the sun.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.600
Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.186
In the fifth century BC?

18:24.269 --> 18:25.896
How long were you two together?

18:25.979 --> 18:27.022
5,000 years.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.943
I guess you can call that long-term.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.445
What happened?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.531
He left.

18:35.989 --> 18:39.701
I always thought he'd come back, but...

18:39.785 --> 18:41.537
he never did.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.872
So, I moved on.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.332
I'm glad you did.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.376
I'm sorry.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.254
I have to go.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.556
This morning,

19:00.639 --> 19:02.141
an unprecedented global earthquake

19:02.224 --> 19:03.725
swept nation-states across the world,

19:03.809 --> 19:06.061
causing damage and panic.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.730
Many have speculated
its connection with the Blip.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.150
The UN has called
for an emergency meeting...

19:11.316 --> 19:13.443
That Deviant healed itself.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.988
They could never do that before.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.409
And it was coming after us
instead of humans.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.660
What's going on?

19:21.827 --> 19:24.621
I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.790
That Deviant is news to me.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.587
Something's happening to Earth.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.673
Can't be a coincidence.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.926
We need to find the others.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.512
I haven't seen
some of them for centuries.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.598
I doubt much has changed.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.611
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.118
But we need to stick together.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.580
And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.875
Let's go to Ajak first.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.711
She'll know what to do.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.258
You hear that, Sprite?

20:19.218 --> 20:21.136
Family reunion.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.804
It's about time.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.194
Hey, that one was mine!
Oh, never mind.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.540
Ajak.

22:14.624 --> 22:15.709
Arishem.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.796
We continue to keep Babylon
safe from the Deviants.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.466
More people have come to seek refuge.

22:22.549 --> 22:25.302
It is now the largest city on Earth.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.387
The Eternals serving their missions

22:27.471 --> 22:28.472
across the galaxies

22:28.638 --> 22:30.640
will learn from your success.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.892
Thank you.

22:34.936 --> 22:38.148
I respect your grand design, Arishem.

22:39.232 --> 22:42.944
But I have noticed something
special about this planet.

22:45.072 --> 22:48.367
And I fear that maybe
this time the cost may...

22:48.450 --> 22:51.328
Do not become
attached to this planet.

22:51.411 --> 22:55.248
You must focus on the true purpose
of your mission.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.168
I understand.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.213
I will not let you down.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.072
Phastos.

23:27.155 --> 23:30.075
Did you go to the party
last night like I told you to?

23:30.242 --> 23:31.243
The party, yeah.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.911
-Yeah, it was...
-He worked all night.

23:33.328 --> 23:34.329
Who was talking to you?

23:34.496 --> 23:35.580
-Get a life.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.916
-And where is Sersi?
-Late as usual.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.292
I'm sorry,
but I have something

23:39.376 --> 23:41.837
very exciting to show you, okay?

23:42.003 --> 23:43.839
Wait till you see this.

23:47.634 --> 23:48.635
What is it?

23:48.802 --> 23:50.345
It's an engine.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.557
It moves steam from
high pressure to low pressure.

23:53.723 --> 23:55.517
Uh, it'll help them till their fields

23:55.600 --> 23:56.768
at an incredibly fast rate.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.311
It's gonna freak them out.

23:58.728 --> 24:01.314
I mean, they only have had
the wheel 1,000 years, so...

24:02.566 --> 24:04.359
You know, we could do that thing

24:04.443 --> 24:06.528
where you use your mind to control them

24:06.611 --> 24:07.612
and then they could do it quicker.

24:07.696 --> 24:08.989
Ajak, you listening to this?

24:09.072 --> 24:11.950
Phastos, this steam...

24:12.117 --> 24:14.202
-Engine. It's a steam engine.
-It's too soon.

24:14.786 --> 24:15.787
And there she is.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.664
What did I miss?

24:17.914 --> 24:21.835
Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.795
I am sure
you have something simpler.

24:23.879 --> 24:24.963
Simple.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.883
Okay, let's see. Uh...

24:28.008 --> 24:30.969
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you

24:32.304 --> 24:33.638
the plow.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.600
'Cause that's what it does.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.143
Plows dirt.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.561
I met another group of settlers

24:39.644 --> 24:41.605
who are building their homes
in the northern fields.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.981
They'll need to plant
their own crops.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.108
-Thanks, Sersi.
-Listen,

24:45.692 --> 24:49.154
humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.

24:50.113 --> 24:52.157
But there is no telling what wonders

24:52.240 --> 24:54.868
they will discover as they advance.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.066
I just saw that.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.026
There's so many other chairs, man.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.444
You know,
I could use my powers...

25:29.528 --> 25:31.112
Come and have a drink with me.

25:31.821 --> 25:32.822
No.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.741
I can't let you go and fight
Deviants on your own.

25:34.824 --> 25:36.576
-We need to guard the city.
-Get out of my way.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.705
I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.917
We need to trust Arishem's design
for this planet.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.004
-Hmm.
-Thena.

25:50.298 --> 25:52.050
It's an honor to fight alongside you.

25:54.427 --> 25:55.720
And you.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.226
My beautiful Makkari.

26:01.309 --> 26:03.645
-You're late.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.450
Well, she also says

26:58.533 --> 27:00.744
that stealing is very, very bad.

27:08.251 --> 27:09.336
Deal.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.599
I promise I won't
let my feelings for Sersi

27:22.682 --> 27:23.975
distract me from my mission.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.727
Humans are far from being able

27:25.810 --> 27:27.312
to protect themselves from the Deviants.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.397
We still have much to do.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.068
Your faith in Arishem is strong.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.153
I can feel it.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.616
But you are allowed
to live a life, you know?

27:39.699 --> 27:42.535
-Go tell Sersi how you feel.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.396
Try.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.190
Sorry.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.525
-I'm making a mess.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.154
Well, not bad.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.314
It matches your eyes.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.194
You're learning
their language now?

28:58.361 --> 29:00.488
If I want to spend more time with you,

29:00.655 --> 29:02.615
I need to get to know them.

29:08.830 --> 29:09.831
Wait, what did I say?

29:09.998 --> 29:13.209
You said, "I am very beautiful."

29:16.337 --> 29:17.380
You...

29:20.341 --> 29:23.052
You are very beautiful, Sersi.

29:34.981 --> 29:36.524
I'm yours, Sersi,

29:37.692 --> 29:38.693
if you'll have me.

30:23.696 --> 30:25.281
I love you, Ikaris.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.702
I love you, Sersi.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.354
Hello?

31:42.025 --> 31:43.192
Ajak?

32:07.926 --> 32:09.552
Ajak!

32:35.620 --> 32:37.288
It was a Deviant.

32:44.003 --> 32:47.090
-Our love

32:47.256 --> 32:50.593
And our devotion

32:51.260 --> 32:56.265
Were as deep as any ocean

33:01.187 --> 33:03.272
It was the last time I saw her.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.986
Ajak asked me to check on Sersi,

33:08.069 --> 33:09.320
so I went to London.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.241
Turned out, both of us were lonely

33:13.324 --> 33:14.575
and we needed each other.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.871
I guess, in her way,

33:18.955 --> 33:21.833
Ajak never stopped
trying to take care of us.

33:30.466 --> 33:31.843
Bye, Ajak.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.890
It's the first time in 7,000 years

33:37.974 --> 33:39.017
one of us has died.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.145
I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London

33:42.228 --> 33:43.980
killed Ajak and absorbed her power.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.982
Deviants have never
done that in the past.

33:46.065 --> 33:48.151
It healed itself just like Ajak.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.945
I swear, I almost heard it speak.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.183
-Arishem.
-Sersi.

34:20.349 --> 34:21.976
It is almost time.

34:23.853 --> 34:26.064
Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay?

34:26.647 --> 34:27.774
What happened, Sersi?

34:31.319 --> 34:33.738
The sphere that Ajak used
to talk with Arishem,

34:33.946 --> 34:36.449
it came out of her body
and went inside me.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.326
Did you talk with Arishem?

34:38.951 --> 34:40.578
Yes. He said

34:41.162 --> 34:42.914
it's almost time.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.875
Can you try talking to him again?

34:46.834 --> 34:48.211
I don't know how.

34:48.377 --> 34:50.254
But she chose you to replace her.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.173
And she gave you the sphere.

34:52.423 --> 34:53.508
Hold on, Sprite.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.552
Are you sure
you talked with Arishem?

34:56.719 --> 34:58.012
What else would it be?

34:59.263 --> 35:00.515
Mahd Wy'ry.

35:36.884 --> 35:40.346
-Where are the others?

35:41.931 --> 35:43.558
There were more Deviants
than you said.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.393
Well, I'm sure
that was a lot of fun for you.

35:45.726 --> 35:46.936
It was.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.190
Once the others
kill these last Deviants,

35:51.941 --> 35:54.193
we will have eliminated them
all from the planet.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.254
-Don't.

36:14.672 --> 36:17.133
We don't interfere in their wars.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.802
This isn't war.

36:20.219 --> 36:21.762
It's genocide.

36:22.138 --> 36:24.182
Their weapons have become too deadly.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.268
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea

36:27.351 --> 36:29.103
helping them advance, Phastos.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.481
Technology is a part of
their evolutionary process, Druig.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.358
It's not exactly something
that I can stop.

36:34.442 --> 36:37.570
-No, you can't. But I can.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.114
It's too late.

36:40.406 --> 36:42.825
-Thena?
-Everyone is going to die.

36:43.951 --> 36:44.952
Are you okay?

36:46.370 --> 36:47.371
Thena?

36:50.625 --> 36:53.211
-Thena? Thena, no!
-Thena!

37:21.656 --> 37:23.950
Don't listen to your head, Thena.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.911
Listen to my voice.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.289
You are safe.

37:31.415 --> 37:34.001
You are loved.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.672
-You're our Thena.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.179
-Hey, Thena!

37:45.346 --> 37:47.598
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

38:05.866 --> 38:07.451
-Is she okay?
-Yeah.

38:08.744 --> 38:09.870
Sersi.

38:10.037 --> 38:11.038
Thena, please.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.666
-Come back to us.

38:13.791 --> 38:14.834
Okay.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.769
I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth.

38:37.189 --> 38:38.858
There is no cure...

38:39.734 --> 38:41.193
so no one really talks about it.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.033
What happened?

38:47.199 --> 38:48.242
Thena.

38:48.409 --> 38:49.952
You attacked everyone.

38:50.369 --> 38:52.747
Wounded Sersi, Phastos,

38:52.913 --> 38:54.874
you nearly killed Makkari.

38:57.376 --> 38:59.211
I don't remember.

38:59.378 --> 39:01.464
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

39:01.630 --> 39:03.841
Your mind is fracturing

39:03.924 --> 39:05.801
under the weight of your memories.

39:05.968 --> 39:10.222
And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.602
I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship

39:14.769 --> 39:16.479
where we have the technology

39:16.562 --> 39:18.314
-to help you.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.234
What if it happens again?
She could've killed you.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.819
She could have killed all of us.

39:23.986 --> 39:24.987
Please.

39:26.655 --> 39:29.158
Please, I... I want to remember.

39:30.159 --> 39:32.036
I want to remember my life.

39:32.661 --> 39:34.163
Thena, I love you.

39:34.330 --> 39:35.956
But listen to me.

39:36.123 --> 39:39.710
It's not important
if you remember or not.

39:40.252 --> 39:42.004
Your spirit will remain.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.965
You will always be Thena deep inside.

39:45.424 --> 39:46.425
Trust me.

39:46.592 --> 39:47.843
Why should she trust you?

39:49.637 --> 39:52.348
You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

39:52.431 --> 39:54.266
Druig, I know you're upset, but...

39:54.433 --> 39:55.476
Upset?

39:57.478 --> 39:59.355
We've trusted you for 7,000 years,

39:59.438 --> 40:00.689
and look where you've gotten us.

40:02.191 --> 40:05.027
I've watched humans
destroy each other

40:05.111 --> 40:07.196
when I could stop it all in a heartbeat.

40:08.989 --> 40:11.700
Do you know what that does
to someone after centuries?

40:12.993 --> 40:15.079
Could our mission have been a mistake?

40:15.871 --> 40:17.289
Are we really helping these people

40:17.373 --> 40:19.083
build a better world, huh?

40:28.134 --> 40:30.511
We're just like the soldiers down there.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.514
Pawns to their leaders.

40:34.181 --> 40:36.267
Blinded by loyalty.

40:39.311 --> 40:41.021
It ends now.

40:58.747 --> 40:59.748
Let them go.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.459
You're gonna have to make me.

41:01.542 --> 41:02.543
Stop.

41:09.091 --> 41:10.634
If you wanna stop me,

41:11.927 --> 41:13.804
you're gonna have to kill me.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.330
I'll watch over Thena.

41:40.039 --> 41:41.123
Let her keep her memories.

41:42.374 --> 41:44.418
One day, when she attacks you,

41:45.044 --> 41:46.629
you might have to kill her.

41:53.219 --> 41:54.553
We'll take that chance.

42:04.772 --> 42:05.940
You may all go.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.568
The Deviants are gone.

42:10.986 --> 42:13.948
There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.699
Shouldn't you ask Arishem first?

42:15.866 --> 42:17.743
We're a team,
we should stay together.

42:17.826 --> 42:20.746
I didn't ask you for your advice, Ikaris.

42:20.913 --> 42:23.249
Do not forget your place.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.712
This is where we say goodbye.

42:29.838 --> 42:31.423
You are free to go.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.969
I want you to go out there.

42:35.135 --> 42:37.888
And live a life for yourselves.

42:38.055 --> 42:39.807
Not as soldiers.

42:40.516 --> 42:43.477
Not with the purpose you were given.

42:43.852 --> 42:46.647
Find your own purpose.

42:47.523 --> 42:51.694
And one day,
when we see each other again,

42:54.154 --> 42:57.157
I want you to tell me what you found.

43:01.495 --> 43:04.665
Come my way
Nach, mera hero

43:04.832 --> 43:07.084
Get the evil away

43:07.209 --> 43:08.377
Nach, mera hero

43:08.460 --> 43:10.671
You came to save

43:10.754 --> 43:12.089
Nach, mera hero

43:12.172 --> 43:14.425
And now you're here

43:14.550 --> 43:16.468
Nach, mera hero, oh

43:17.886 --> 43:21.348
Now you have come home
Give it all to me

43:21.515 --> 43:25.227
You would risk it all
For the victory

43:25.394 --> 43:29.315
Waiting for you
Scarcely can I

44:07.144 --> 44:09.938
I am Karun Patel.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.315
Kingo's valet.

44:12.149 --> 44:14.193
It's truly an honor
to be in the presence

44:14.276 --> 44:15.527
of the great Eternals.

44:17.321 --> 44:20.783
Like the fire
Like the sun

44:20.949 --> 44:24.578
You have risen, Mighty one

44:33.796 --> 44:35.714
Cut! Okay, everyone,

44:35.798 --> 44:36.924
-that was good.

44:37.091 --> 44:38.842
But we could do 10% better.

44:39.009 --> 44:41.095
That was beautiful. Very, very good.

44:41.261 --> 44:43.013
-Really, so good.

44:43.347 --> 44:45.432
My friends
from college are here.

44:45.974 --> 44:46.975
Hello, boss!

44:47.685 --> 44:48.977
Perfect timing!

44:49.061 --> 44:50.979
Welcome to the set of...

44:53.399 --> 44:54.483
I'm playing you!

44:54.650 --> 44:56.318
-You like the costume?
-We need to talk.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.861
Tell the director
I have some notes for him...

44:57.945 --> 44:59.154
We need to talk to you in private.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.907
Oh, Karun, he's worked
with me for 50 years.

45:01.990 --> 45:03.283
I trust him completely.

45:03.367 --> 45:05.869
Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire,

45:05.953 --> 45:07.246
and he tried to stake me
through the heart.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.498
I have apologized so many times.

45:09.665 --> 45:10.874
Not quite enough times.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.251
Very close, though. I'll let you know.

45:12.418 --> 45:13.836
Oh, I have to get ready
for the next scene.

45:13.919 --> 45:15.421
Come to my tent, we'll talk there.

45:15.587 --> 45:16.755
You guys are gonna love
the next scene.

45:16.922 --> 45:19.925
I come in on a wire
'cause, you know, I can't fly.

45:20.008 --> 45:21.677
Wait, are we getting back together?

45:21.844 --> 45:22.845
We need to talk.

45:22.928 --> 45:24.138
I've been waiting for the day

45:24.221 --> 45:25.305
the world learns the true identity

45:25.389 --> 45:26.390
of the Shadow Warrior.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.016
Ajak's dead.

45:33.105 --> 45:34.481
She was killed.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.775
It was a Deviant.

45:41.321 --> 45:42.865
The Deviants are back.

45:43.115 --> 45:44.575
We don't know how many there are.

45:48.620 --> 45:50.038
You need to come with us.

46:06.263 --> 46:08.432
I can't just go. I mean,
all these people depend on me.

46:08.515 --> 46:09.850
We just started shooting this movie.

46:09.933 --> 46:11.101
It's the first of a trilogy.

46:11.643 --> 46:13.729
We just got BTS to do a cameo...

46:15.314 --> 46:16.482
Sir,

46:16.774 --> 46:18.859
-may I say something?
-Please don't say anything.

46:18.942 --> 46:19.985
I think you should go.

46:20.068 --> 46:21.445
I just said don't say anything.

46:21.612 --> 46:25.866
"Life affords no greater duty
than to protect one's family!"<

46:26.700 --> 46:28.660
Remember? It's your favorite line

46:28.827 --> 46:33.332
from The Shadow Warrior
Voyage of Time.

46:33.916 --> 46:35.751
Your family needs you.

46:46.678 --> 46:48.847
Seven thousand years.

46:50.641 --> 46:52.559
That's how long
the battle between Eternals

46:52.643 --> 46:54.353
and Deviants has raged for.

46:54.978 --> 46:57.064
You think I'm a movie star.

46:57.147 --> 46:59.983
Well, I am. But I am also...

47:00.901 --> 47:02.486
an Eternal.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.154
Kingo, what are you doing?

47:05.030 --> 47:08.242
I think we should be
remembered, so...

47:08.534 --> 47:12.579
I am making a documentary about us.

47:12.704 --> 47:15.707
You are about to meet
my fellow Eternal, Sprite.

47:15.874 --> 47:18.085
Sprite, tell them about yourself.

47:18.252 --> 47:19.586
Oh, wait.

47:23.465 --> 47:25.968
Okay, well, we'll circle back to her.

47:26.635 --> 47:28.846
This is Sersi.

47:29.429 --> 47:30.514
Sersi,

47:30.597 --> 47:32.432
tell them about yourself.

47:34.268 --> 47:35.602
-Uh...
-We're rolling.

47:35.686 --> 47:36.687
Well, uh...

47:38.355 --> 47:42.943
I can change a rock into water.

47:43.360 --> 47:46.238
Uh, I could turn a rock into wood.

47:46.405 --> 47:48.574
Or a rock into metal.

47:48.657 --> 47:50.742
Actually, one time,
I turned a rock into air.

47:50.826 --> 47:51.827
Cut.

47:51.910 --> 47:54.371
Um, you know what?
Why don't you think about it,

47:54.454 --> 47:56.081
and we'll get back to you, okay?

47:56.248 --> 47:57.499
Let's go.

48:00.210 --> 48:02.546
Sprite says
you're addicted to this thing.

48:04.673 --> 48:05.841
Oh, this?

48:06.717 --> 48:08.218
Look at this.

48:10.345 --> 48:11.471
Whoa.

48:11.555 --> 48:13.181
You know,
seeing as we don't age.

48:13.682 --> 48:15.517
-I think you look quite good.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.103
-Don't you?

48:22.274 --> 48:24.151
Nobody ever wonders
how you managed

48:24.234 --> 48:26.111
to be the leading man for over 100 years?

48:26.320 --> 48:27.863
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

48:28.030 --> 48:30.198
That is my great-great-grandfather,

48:30.365 --> 48:32.659
that is my great-grandfather,

48:32.826 --> 48:33.827
grandfather,

48:33.994 --> 48:36.038
father, and me.

48:36.204 --> 48:37.873
I'm part of the greatest dynasty

48:37.956 --> 48:39.207
in the history of Bollywood.

48:39.666 --> 48:40.667
Pretty impressive, right?

48:40.751 --> 48:42.544
You abandoned me in Macedonia.

48:44.630 --> 48:48.175
Okay, I got sick
of moving every five years.

48:48.258 --> 48:51.219
People freak out
when they notice that you don't...

48:53.305 --> 48:54.306
age.

48:55.557 --> 48:57.017
I thought we were friends.

49:04.024 --> 49:05.901
Do you know why I love movies?

49:06.777 --> 49:08.487
Because of you.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.155
I missed sitting in the audience,

49:10.238 --> 49:11.406
listening to your stories,

49:11.490 --> 49:12.741
watching your illusions.

49:17.537 --> 49:19.748
We should've all stayed together.

49:21.750 --> 49:23.835
Ajak would still be alive.

49:25.420 --> 49:27.214
She should have never let us go.

49:38.016 --> 49:39.893
This is the Deviant you fought in London?

49:40.227 --> 49:41.645
It's different.

49:42.437 --> 49:44.564
There must be more out there
than we thought.

49:44.856 --> 49:45.941
Oh.

49:46.024 --> 49:48.151
Is... Is this a Deviant, sir?

49:48.235 --> 49:50.028
-Yep.

49:50.153 --> 49:52.030
It's a beautiful creature.

49:52.114 --> 49:55.784
What? This? This? No. It's hideous.

49:55.867 --> 49:58.286
You've never had one try
to bite your head off. Roll.

49:58.370 --> 49:59.496
Oh.

49:59.871 --> 50:01.915
You're about to meet
two of the greatest warriors

50:01.999 --> 50:03.417
the world has ever known.

50:03.625 --> 50:07.295
Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable.

50:07.379 --> 50:08.922
And her trusty friend...

50:09.089 --> 50:10.173
Door.

50:10.882 --> 50:12.926
...a mighty powerhouse of strength,

50:13.010 --> 50:15.971
the fearsome Gilgamesh!

50:18.473 --> 50:19.516
Gilgamesh!

50:22.519 --> 50:24.104
What took you so long?

50:27.190 --> 50:29.109
You look younger today,
Sprite.

50:29.192 --> 50:30.694
I have the same apron.

50:31.194 --> 50:32.487
Who the hell are you?

50:32.904 --> 50:35.073
I'm Karun. Kingo's valet.

50:35.615 --> 50:38.326
Oh, valet. Like Alfred in Batman.

50:38.702 --> 50:41.163
Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back.

50:41.246 --> 50:43.915
No shit.
I could have used some help.

50:43.999 --> 50:46.626
We were attacked
by a Deviant in London, too.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.503
Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.

50:49.379 --> 50:50.380
You couldn't?

50:50.547 --> 50:52.591
I was distracted.

50:52.674 --> 50:54.843
Sure, man.

50:54.926 --> 50:57.512
Hey, you guys wanna try my pie?

50:59.806 --> 51:01.391
I'm sorry, Gil.

51:02.059 --> 51:03.435
Ajak's dead.

51:06.271 --> 51:07.522
It's true, buddy.

51:08.106 --> 51:09.399
We lost her.

51:41.389 --> 51:42.557
Sersi.

51:43.975 --> 51:45.852
The attack triggered her.

51:46.019 --> 51:47.938
She's no fun to be around right now.

51:49.523 --> 51:50.982
Hey, Thena.

51:51.399 --> 51:52.400
Look who's here.

51:54.152 --> 51:55.320
Give me your hand.

51:58.073 --> 51:59.449
-Thena.

51:59.533 --> 52:02.285
Everyone in Centuri-6
is going to die.

52:02.994 --> 52:04.121
Give me your hand.

52:04.204 --> 52:06.540
It's too late. We can't save them.

52:06.623 --> 52:08.458
-Thena.

52:14.589 --> 52:15.841
Thena.

52:16.550 --> 52:19.261
We came to Earth
together on our ship.

52:21.555 --> 52:23.265
You're an Eternal.

52:24.099 --> 52:26.852
The greatest warrior of Olympia.

52:26.935 --> 52:29.104
The legendary protector of Athens.

52:30.605 --> 52:32.482
The goddess of war.

52:34.484 --> 52:36.820
Remember who you are.

52:44.870 --> 52:46.329
Remember.

53:02.220 --> 53:04.181
-Thena.
-Hi.

53:05.140 --> 53:06.141
Hello.

53:06.516 --> 53:08.476
Hey, who's your gardener?

53:09.978 --> 53:12.272
This is just what you guys
eat every day?

53:12.355 --> 53:13.899
-Yeah, this is amazing.
-Every day.

53:14.065 --> 53:16.151
-Thank you for this.
-Oh, you're welcome.

53:16.318 --> 53:17.485
Help yourself.

53:17.652 --> 53:20.822
This one is a trio of wine,
beer, and mead.

53:20.989 --> 53:23.617
Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

53:24.117 --> 53:25.702
-That's so thoughtful.

53:32.500 --> 53:34.085
Should she be drinking?

53:35.337 --> 53:38.757
No, hers is
non-alcoholic. For kids.

53:40.842 --> 53:43.011
I gave you the same thing, Sprite.

53:45.639 --> 53:46.640
For kids.

53:48.892 --> 53:50.352
I was just kidding.

53:50.435 --> 53:53.813
Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you

53:53.980 --> 53:55.899
after we helped defeat
Laufey's army in Tonsberg.

53:57.234 --> 53:59.527
-What? Oh.

53:59.653 --> 54:00.737
I'm a big baby.

54:00.820 --> 54:02.697
-Very mature. Can you stop?

54:03.573 --> 54:04.991
-Stop.
-Speaking of Odin...

54:05.075 --> 54:07.661
Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

54:07.827 --> 54:10.497
Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

54:10.580 --> 54:13.041
So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone,

54:13.124 --> 54:15.085
who do you think
is gonna lead the Avengers?

54:15.752 --> 54:17.337
I could lead them.

54:17.420 --> 54:19.631
-I figure I'd be good at that.
-Yeah, you would.

54:19.965 --> 54:22.175
Ajak didn't even choose you
to lead us.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.678
-Whoa.
-Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

54:24.761 --> 54:25.971
-Harsh.
-I'm gonna let that one slide

54:26.054 --> 54:27.055
because, you know,

54:27.138 --> 54:28.515
you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.

54:28.598 --> 54:29.933
Oh, so what, you can fly.

54:30.016 --> 54:31.726
I'm better-looking,
everybody knows that.

54:31.893 --> 54:32.894
-Where you going?

54:34.896 --> 54:36.564
I'm just gonna get some air.

54:41.111 --> 54:43.780
Mmm. This is really good, Gil.

54:43.947 --> 54:45.282
You know, I could sell this.

54:45.365 --> 54:47.158
Put my face on it,
move some units.

54:47.492 --> 54:48.785
I made it from corn.

54:48.868 --> 54:52.580
I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.

55:06.761 --> 55:09.848
Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?

55:09.931 --> 55:11.725
Yeah, it's a planet.

55:12.642 --> 55:14.269
She thinks she used to live there

55:14.352 --> 55:16.354
until it was destroyed.

55:16.438 --> 55:20.150
Always talks about massive
quakes ripping it apart.

55:20.233 --> 55:22.152
Everyone died, including herself.

55:22.569 --> 55:25.238
We had an unprecedented global
earthquake three days ago.

55:25.905 --> 55:27.824
Oh, that's what that was.

55:27.907 --> 55:29.659
I thought I was drunk.

55:30.410 --> 55:32.620
Ajak chose me to lead us, but...

55:33.371 --> 55:35.999
I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

55:36.082 --> 55:37.959
I've tried so many times.

55:39.169 --> 55:41.254
Maybe you're trying too hard.

55:42.213 --> 55:44.799
Sometimes, you just have to listen.

56:32.222 --> 56:33.348
Sersi.

56:34.224 --> 56:35.308
Arishem.

56:35.892 --> 56:37.769
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

56:37.936 --> 56:40.355
We think it absorbed her power.

56:40.522 --> 56:43.233
And something unusual
is happening to Earth.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.403
It is a side effect
of the emergence.

56:47.821 --> 56:49.447
The emergence?

56:50.198 --> 56:51.699
It is time for you to learn

56:51.783 --> 56:54.369
the true purpose of your mission.

56:54.536 --> 56:56.079
You were sent to Earth

56:56.162 --> 56:59.874
to bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.

57:01.084 --> 57:06.256
Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

57:06.339 --> 57:09.300
I plant Celestial seeds into host planets

57:09.384 --> 57:10.844
across the universe.

57:12.971 --> 57:16.850
The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

57:22.230 --> 57:23.898
In order to grow,

57:23.982 --> 57:26.568
Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy

57:26.651 --> 57:27.819
from intelligent life.

57:28.820 --> 57:32.407
The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans

57:32.490 --> 57:35.160
until the Eternals eliminated them.

57:35.785 --> 57:39.164
Now, the human population of this planet

57:39.247 --> 57:41.791
has reached the required amount.

57:41.875 --> 57:44.919
It is time for the emergence to begin.

58:03.980 --> 58:05.940
But...

58:07.233 --> 58:08.985
everyone on Earth will die.

58:10.653 --> 58:13.740
The end of one life, Sersi,

58:15.116 --> 58:17.911
is the beginning of another.

58:30.882 --> 58:34.761
Our universe is a constant
exchange of energy.

58:35.762 --> 58:39.807
An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.

58:40.725 --> 58:42.936
Celestials use energy

58:43.019 --> 58:46.231
gathered from host planets to create suns,

58:46.898 --> 58:50.109
generating gravity, heat, and light

58:50.276 --> 58:52.779
for new galaxies to form.

58:57.784 --> 58:59.410
Without us,

58:59.577 --> 59:02.247
our universe will fall into darkness.

59:05.500 --> 59:07.377
All life will die.

59:08.586 --> 59:10.338
Ajak knew the truth?

59:10.755 --> 59:12.799
She has helped many Celestials

59:12.882 --> 59:15.635
to emerge over millions of years.

59:15.802 --> 59:16.844
So have you.

59:19.931 --> 59:21.849
Earth was my first mission.

59:23.643 --> 59:27.355
I was home, on Olympia.

59:28.690 --> 59:31.109
There is no Olympia.

59:49.210 --> 59:52.255
This is your true home, Sersi.

59:53.298 --> 59:55.008
The World Forge.

59:57.844 --> 1:00:02.098
It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

1:00:38.051 --> 1:00:40.053
Everything dies except us

1:00:41.346 --> 1:00:43.389
because we were never alive.

1:00:47.602 --> 1:00:49.395
Why don't I remember any of this?

1:00:59.781 --> 1:01:02.992
Because your memories
are erased and reset

1:01:03.076 --> 1:01:04.410
after each emergence.

1:01:05.536 --> 1:01:07.080
They are stored here.

1:01:09.791 --> 1:01:11.417
Why do you keep them?

1:01:12.251 --> 1:01:15.672
I keep them in order
to study the Deviants.

1:01:16.798 --> 1:01:19.384
I created the Deviants, Sersi,

1:01:19.550 --> 1:01:22.470
for the same purpose I created you.

1:01:23.554 --> 1:01:27.392
Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.

1:01:31.104 --> 1:01:34.232
I first sent the Deviants
to exterminate them

1:01:34.399 --> 1:01:36.943
so intelligent life could grow.

1:01:42.490 --> 1:01:45.159
But there was a flaw in their design.

1:01:46.452 --> 1:01:47.787
They evolved.

1:01:47.954 --> 1:01:49.997
Became predators themselves.

1:01:51.749 --> 1:01:54.168
And I lost control of them.

1:01:56.254 --> 1:01:59.215
I built and programmed you,
Eternals,

1:01:59.298 --> 1:02:03.261
to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution,

1:02:03.428 --> 1:02:05.596
to correct my mistake.

1:02:07.807 --> 1:02:11.936
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place

1:02:12.019 --> 1:02:13.730
as the Prime Eternal.

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:16.691
Do not fail me.

1:02:35.293 --> 1:02:37.962
So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

1:02:38.045 --> 1:02:41.382
And our past memories
are stored somewhere

1:02:42.175 --> 1:02:43.843
in space?

1:02:43.926 --> 1:02:45.845
And Arishem made the Deviants.

1:02:48.139 --> 1:02:49.891
I'm sorry, Thena.

1:02:50.183 --> 1:02:51.684
You tried to warn us.

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:53.728
The last time
Arishem reset your memories,

1:02:53.811 --> 1:02:55.772
something must have gone wrong.

1:02:56.522 --> 1:02:57.523
What do you mean?

1:02:57.690 --> 1:03:01.027
Well, that's what
Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

1:03:01.194 --> 1:03:02.904
All this time,
Thena was remembering

1:03:02.987 --> 1:03:04.697
all the other planets we were sent to

1:03:04.781 --> 1:03:06.949
and everyone dying
during the emergence.

1:03:07.408 --> 1:03:08.868
I thought we were heroes.

1:03:09.535 --> 1:03:10.870
Turns out we're the bad guys.

1:03:11.037 --> 1:03:13.331
We're not the bad guys, okay?

1:03:13.498 --> 1:03:14.832
We've helped the Celestials

1:03:14.916 --> 1:03:16.459
expand life across the universe.

1:03:16.542 --> 1:03:19.712
That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

1:03:19.879 --> 1:03:21.088
Every time innocent lives

1:03:21.172 --> 1:03:22.799
have been sacrificed for the greater good,

1:03:22.965 --> 1:03:25.009
it turns out to be a mistake.

1:03:25.635 --> 1:03:27.303
We have to stop the emergence.

1:03:27.470 --> 1:03:31.140
Sersi, we have no right to
stop the birth of a Celestial.

1:03:31.224 --> 1:03:33.059
There has to be a way
Tiamut can emerge

1:03:33.142 --> 1:03:34.143
without destroying the Earth.

1:03:35.144 --> 1:03:38.356
We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

1:03:39.148 --> 1:03:41.359
Could Druig control its mind?

1:03:41.526 --> 1:03:43.778
Maybe put it to sleep?

1:03:43.945 --> 1:03:45.071
"Put it to sleep"?

1:03:45.530 --> 1:03:46.656
Are you serious?

1:03:46.823 --> 1:03:49.325
Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

1:03:50.618 --> 1:03:52.370
So I could take a vacation
to Fiji, you know?

1:03:52.537 --> 1:03:54.163
We're talking about a Celestial, okay?

1:03:54.247 --> 1:03:55.248
We have to try.

1:03:55.331 --> 1:03:58.751
Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

1:03:58.918 --> 1:04:00.253
Right.

1:04:02.171 --> 1:04:05.299
I'm human. I'm a little biased.

1:04:09.595 --> 1:04:10.972
And do what?

1:04:11.597 --> 1:04:13.224
Watch TV?

1:04:13.391 --> 1:04:16.811
When I could be with the
Earth's original superheroes

1:04:16.894 --> 1:04:18.896
as they try to save the world?

1:04:20.314 --> 1:04:21.482
Fine.

1:04:21.649 --> 1:04:24.193
If you want to, stay.

1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:26.112
Thank you very much, sir.

1:04:27.822 --> 1:04:29.031
Gilgamesh,

1:04:29.198 --> 1:04:30.741
could you please
get rid of the saliva beer?

1:04:30.825 --> 1:04:32.201
I thought you like it, man.

1:04:32.285 --> 1:04:34.370
We need to go. Now.

1:04:35.204 --> 1:04:36.581
Find the others.

1:04:36.914 --> 1:04:38.165
Once we're all together,

1:04:38.332 --> 1:04:41.043
we'll decide what to do
about the emergence.

1:05:15.077 --> 1:05:16.662
It's very nice here, sir.

1:05:16.829 --> 1:05:18.122
Don't be fooled.

1:05:19.248 --> 1:05:21.334
-Ignorance is bliss.

1:05:37.308 --> 1:05:38.517
Hello, Sprite.

1:05:46.317 --> 1:05:48.194
I missed all of you.

1:05:51.113 --> 1:05:55.076
Please, make yourselves at home.

1:05:59.872 --> 1:06:01.666
You've given me a lot of bad news

1:06:01.749 --> 1:06:02.875
in one go, my lady.

1:06:03.626 --> 1:06:04.794
Will you help us?

1:06:05.294 --> 1:06:06.337
I am glad that...

1:06:13.636 --> 1:06:14.929
Hey, what's your service?

1:06:15.012 --> 1:06:16.472
I'm not getting any bars.

1:06:18.182 --> 1:06:21.519
Do you all remember
this forest? Beautiful.

1:06:22.687 --> 1:06:24.730
It was the last place
we all lived together.

1:06:26.190 --> 1:06:29.151
I've protected these people
for 20 generations now

1:06:29.318 --> 1:06:32.321
from the outside world
and from themselves.

1:06:32.488 --> 1:06:35.408
Your kind, my friend,
you will be responsible

1:06:35.491 --> 1:06:37.201
for your own extinction one day.

1:06:37.743 --> 1:06:39.286
Don't you think?

1:06:39.745 --> 1:06:41.706
I think we must learn from our mistakes

1:06:41.789 --> 1:06:42.915
and do better, sir.

1:06:43.082 --> 1:06:44.959
-You must not give up hope.

1:06:47.878 --> 1:06:49.588
Oh, no, you didn't.

1:06:49.672 --> 1:06:52.216
Okay, new rule, no more
possessing people's valets.

1:06:52.299 --> 1:06:53.759
Oh, where is your sense of humor, Kingo?

1:06:53.926 --> 1:06:54.927
I'm sorry, sir.

1:06:55.011 --> 1:06:57.304
Don't apologize, it's not your fault.

1:06:58.014 --> 1:07:00.641
You are not a god.
You know that, right?

1:07:00.808 --> 1:07:03.853
How ironic. Kingo, the movie star.

1:07:04.603 --> 1:07:06.188
I've directed some things, too.

1:07:06.355 --> 1:07:07.732
Oh, yeah? Like what?

1:07:08.315 --> 1:07:09.900
Some Internet content.

1:07:10.651 --> 1:07:11.652
How many views?

1:07:11.819 --> 1:07:13.738
I don't do it for the views.

1:07:13.904 --> 1:07:15.698
Let's go. He's wasting our time.

1:07:15.865 --> 1:07:18.159
- We need him.
- Ikaris.

1:07:19.201 --> 1:07:20.286
I missed you.

1:07:21.203 --> 1:07:23.289
Are you gonna charm me
or threaten me?

1:07:23.456 --> 1:07:25.499
I mean, there's a third
option, if you prefer that.

1:07:25.666 --> 1:07:27.460
It must be heartbreaking to find out

1:07:27.543 --> 1:07:28.544
that you're not Mother's favorite.

1:07:28.711 --> 1:07:29.754
And I'm sure she'd be real proud

1:07:29.879 --> 1:07:31.547
-of what you've been up to.
-Druig, this is serious.

1:07:31.714 --> 1:07:33.507
I'll tell you what's serious.

1:07:34.425 --> 1:07:36.844
I've just been told I've been
sent on a suicide mission

1:07:36.927 --> 1:07:38.387
for the past 7,000 years,

1:07:38.554 --> 1:07:41.891
and that my entire existence is a lie.

1:07:45.061 --> 1:07:46.771
So, excuse me for not giving a shit

1:07:46.854 --> 1:07:48.397
about your plan right now.

1:07:53.277 --> 1:07:54.695
Druig sucks.

1:07:54.862 --> 1:07:56.489
He does, sir.

1:08:16.967 --> 1:08:18.719
I don't like this place.

1:08:19.178 --> 1:08:20.387
Druig needs to think,

1:08:20.471 --> 1:08:22.348
and Sersi wants us to wait, so...

1:08:22.515 --> 1:08:24.475
-we wait.
-Mm.

1:08:25.601 --> 1:08:28.604
I couldn't recognize myself
in Sprite's illusions.

1:08:30.523 --> 1:08:32.733
Those were the good old days.

1:08:34.610 --> 1:08:36.570
What if I can't fight anymore?

1:08:38.322 --> 1:08:40.241
-Of course you can.
-Mm.

1:08:40.908 --> 1:08:42.952
What if I hurt you again?

1:08:43.327 --> 1:08:48.541
Come on. You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.

1:08:53.379 --> 1:08:54.797
Thank you.

1:08:56.257 --> 1:08:57.508
For what?

1:08:59.385 --> 1:09:02.555
-For always taking care of me.
-Oh.

1:09:03.931 --> 1:09:05.641
I'd do it again.

1:09:08.477 --> 1:09:10.437
On any planet.

1:09:29.582 --> 1:09:31.041
I like watching him, too.

1:09:31.208 --> 1:09:32.376
Jeez.

1:09:33.502 --> 1:09:35.129
I don't think it's creepy at all.

1:09:37.923 --> 1:09:39.758
Have you read Peter Pan?

1:09:39.925 --> 1:09:43.053
Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter,

1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:44.430
Sersi is Wendy,

1:09:44.513 --> 1:09:47.558
you are Tinker Bell, for obvious reasons,

1:09:48.767 --> 1:09:51.145
and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.

1:09:51.604 --> 1:09:53.105
What's your point?

1:09:53.564 --> 1:09:56.108
Tinker Bell's always been
in love with Peter.

1:09:59.528 --> 1:10:01.030
And it's hard for her

1:10:01.113 --> 1:10:02.740
'cause she can never be with him.

1:10:05.659 --> 1:10:07.161
I'm sorry, Sprite.

1:10:09.079 --> 1:10:10.331
Kingo...

1:10:12.917 --> 1:10:15.419
why did Arishem
make me this way?

1:10:17.421 --> 1:10:18.464
I don't know.

1:10:26.513 --> 1:10:27.973
I thought you broke it.

1:10:28.057 --> 1:10:29.850
Always bring backups.

1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:36.774
You have a very angry family, sir.

1:10:37.524 --> 1:10:39.401
Yeah, it's a big issue.

1:10:39.568 --> 1:10:41.278
What about King Midas?

1:10:41.362 --> 1:10:42.488
Everything he touched turned to gold.

1:10:42.655 --> 1:10:43.656
-Was that you?
-Dane.

1:10:43.822 --> 1:10:45.741
-Confucius? Aristotle?
-Call your uncle.

1:10:45.908 --> 1:10:47.493
What? My uncle? No.

1:10:47.660 --> 1:10:49.828
You've always wanted to make
amends with him, right?

1:10:49.995 --> 1:10:52.373
Now is the time. Trust me.

1:10:52.539 --> 1:10:54.124
-Sersi, you're so weird.

1:10:54.291 --> 1:10:56.710
-Dane? Dane?

1:10:57.211 --> 1:10:59.338
You're breaking up.

1:10:59.421 --> 1:11:00.714
You're breaking up?

1:11:03.425 --> 1:11:05.052
How did he take the news?

1:11:05.469 --> 1:11:06.762
Couldn't bring myself to tell him

1:11:06.845 --> 1:11:08.013
it was the end of the world.

1:11:08.180 --> 1:11:10.432
There's nothing he could do.

1:11:10.599 --> 1:11:11.600
Sersi.

1:11:14.979 --> 1:11:16.689
I'm worried about you.

1:11:17.690 --> 1:11:18.774
If Arishem finds out

1:11:18.857 --> 1:11:20.401
you're trying to stop the emergence...

1:11:22.611 --> 1:11:24.905
I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

1:11:30.995 --> 1:11:31.996
I'm not afraid.

1:11:33.831 --> 1:11:35.624
This violent cycle has to end.

1:11:40.754 --> 1:11:42.589
Hey, stop worrying about me.

1:11:43.674 --> 1:11:45.009
Old habit.

1:11:52.182 --> 1:11:54.268
Why did you leave?

1:11:56.061 --> 1:11:57.187
I told myself

1:11:58.063 --> 1:12:00.065
something must have happened to you.

1:12:00.232 --> 1:12:02.234
So, I waited.

1:12:02.401 --> 1:12:04.862
Days became years,

1:12:05.029 --> 1:12:07.239
and you never came back.

1:12:09.116 --> 1:12:10.701
Sersi,

1:12:11.452 --> 1:12:13.287
oh, I've missed you.

1:12:15.956 --> 1:12:17.958
I didn't want to leave.

1:12:21.045 --> 1:12:22.254
There's something
I have to tell...

1:12:22.338 --> 1:12:24.089
-Ikaris!

1:12:24.715 --> 1:12:25.924
Ikaris!

1:12:35.059 --> 1:12:36.560
-Watch out!

1:12:36.727 --> 1:12:38.979
-Clear the camp!

1:12:41.357 --> 1:12:42.691
Get behind me!

1:12:42.858 --> 1:12:43.859
One of them took Ikaris.

1:12:44.026 --> 1:12:45.194
It's an ambush!

1:12:54.620 --> 1:12:56.163
Very nice, sir!

1:12:56.497 --> 1:12:58.040
Are you mental? Hide!

1:12:58.207 --> 1:13:00.584
-We need action sequences.

1:13:01.210 --> 1:13:02.419
Sir!

1:13:03.003 --> 1:13:04.797
Sprite, get Karun out of here.

1:13:07.049 --> 1:13:09.927
How many cameras
did you bring, young man?

1:13:17.726 --> 1:13:19.144
Kingo!

1:13:19.311 --> 1:13:20.729
Come on!

1:13:27.444 --> 1:13:28.654
This way!

1:13:28.821 --> 1:13:29.988
Quickly! Come on!

1:13:35.119 --> 1:13:36.870
Get in! Get in!

1:14:14.032 --> 1:14:15.617
-Ikaris!

1:14:31.216 --> 1:14:35.012
I've fought that one before.
It's stronger than the others.

1:14:38.098 --> 1:14:39.308
No.

1:14:40.976 --> 1:14:42.686
-Terrible timing, Thena.

1:14:42.769 --> 1:14:44.521
-Thena!

1:14:53.030 --> 1:14:54.281
Stop, Thena!

1:15:29.691 --> 1:15:30.817
Let them go.

1:15:30.984 --> 1:15:32.528
Now is not the time, Sersi.

1:15:32.694 --> 1:15:35.864
Please. I know
you're better than this.

1:15:45.123 --> 1:15:47.042
Druig.

1:15:47.459 --> 1:15:49.461
Go! Get to the river!

1:16:07.437 --> 1:16:08.855
Gilgamesh.

1:16:09.523 --> 1:16:11.233
A little help here?

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:12.526
Stay here.

1:16:13.193 --> 1:16:14.194
Say it.

1:16:15.612 --> 1:16:16.613
Stay here.

1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:18.865
Good. You're okay.

1:16:30.627 --> 1:16:32.087
They're headed for the camp.

1:16:32.254 --> 1:16:33.964
Go. They need you.

1:16:34.131 --> 1:16:35.549
Go, Ikaris.

1:16:43.515 --> 1:16:45.642
Sprite, buy me some time!

1:16:52.107 --> 1:16:53.734
Whoa. Whoa!

1:16:54.943 --> 1:16:56.737
-Can you hurry up?

1:16:58.864 --> 1:16:59.865
Now!

1:17:03.827 --> 1:17:05.621
-Dishoom.

1:17:14.379 --> 1:17:17.174
-Karun! Did you get that?

1:17:17.341 --> 1:17:19.092
I did, sir!

1:17:54.127 --> 1:17:55.879
-Kingo!
-Just go.

1:17:56.046 --> 1:17:57.506
I'm not leaving you.

1:17:57.839 --> 1:17:58.882
Sprite!

1:18:33.542 --> 1:18:34.543
Ikaris!

1:19:17.169 --> 1:19:19.588
Sersi! Are you all right?

1:19:30.182 --> 1:19:31.892
How did you do that?

1:19:32.726 --> 1:19:34.227
I don't know.

1:19:47.657 --> 1:19:49.409
Stop, stop, stop.

1:19:51.203 --> 1:19:52.287
Thena.

1:20:35.121 --> 1:20:37.415
-No. Gilgamesh.

1:20:37.916 --> 1:20:39.209
Stay back.

1:20:47.342 --> 1:20:48.760
Ajak...

1:20:50.387 --> 1:20:51.763
Her memories...

1:20:53.849 --> 1:20:55.851
I understand now.

1:20:56.977 --> 1:20:59.271
I can see what she saw.

1:21:00.522 --> 1:21:01.940
So many planets.

1:21:03.441 --> 1:21:05.652
So much life destroyed

1:21:05.735 --> 1:21:08.530
every time a Celestial is born.

1:21:09.656 --> 1:21:11.616
Arishem used us

1:21:11.700 --> 1:21:16.246
and left us to die
with each emergence.

1:21:16.329 --> 1:21:17.956
We just wanted to survive.

1:21:20.417 --> 1:21:22.544
And then he sent you.

1:21:23.837 --> 1:21:25.505
I will kill you all

1:21:25.589 --> 1:21:28.174
for what you have done to my kind.

1:21:28.258 --> 1:21:30.969
You are not saviors, Eternals.

1:21:31.511 --> 1:21:33.179
You are murderers.

1:21:36.808 --> 1:21:37.809
Ikaris!

1:21:52.866 --> 1:21:54.242
Thena.

1:21:57.245 --> 1:21:58.496
Hey.

1:22:00.457 --> 1:22:02.000
Remember.

1:22:10.300 --> 1:22:11.760
No.

1:22:13.637 --> 1:22:14.930
No.

1:22:17.349 --> 1:22:19.809
I'll remember.

1:22:19.976 --> 1:22:21.519
I'll remember.

1:22:44.542 --> 1:22:45.835
I'll remember.

1:23:29.087 --> 1:23:30.672
When I left,

1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:33.717
I thought about taking over the minds

1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:36.052
of every human on this planet.

1:23:36.928 --> 1:23:40.223
Violence, fear, greed,

1:23:40.390 --> 1:23:41.933
all gone.

1:23:42.100 --> 1:23:43.268
Why didn't you?

1:23:43.435 --> 1:23:46.021
Because without their flaws,

1:23:46.563 --> 1:23:47.981
they wouldn't be human.

1:23:51.484 --> 1:23:54.487
Please, Druig.
You can't stay here anymore.

1:23:55.238 --> 1:23:56.865
These Deviants are trying to keep us

1:23:56.948 --> 1:23:58.908
from killing their own kind.

1:23:58.992 --> 1:24:00.618
They have a conscience now.

1:24:00.702 --> 1:24:01.911
That makes them more dangerous.

1:24:01.995 --> 1:24:03.788
No, Sersi.

1:24:04.873 --> 1:24:07.292
That makes them us.

1:24:08.001 --> 1:24:09.961
Eternals and Deviants.

1:24:11.171 --> 1:24:12.797
Arishem's children.

1:24:13.965 --> 1:24:15.925
But you are asking me to take control

1:24:16.009 --> 1:24:17.719
of a mind of a Celestial.

1:24:17.927 --> 1:24:21.139
I do not have that kind of power.

1:24:21.306 --> 1:24:23.016
We'll need Phastos.

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:26.978
Well, good luck.

1:24:27.812 --> 1:24:30.732
He gave up on humans
a long time ago.

1:25:03.389 --> 1:25:04.682
I did this.

1:25:06.601 --> 1:25:08.937
If my technology
hadn't helped them advance...

1:25:14.359 --> 1:25:16.236
Druig was right.

1:25:17.112 --> 1:25:19.197
Our mission was a mistake.

1:25:19.823 --> 1:25:21.407
These people...

1:25:23.368 --> 1:25:24.619
they're not worth saving.

1:25:24.786 --> 1:25:26.621
Oh, Phastos.

1:25:26.788 --> 1:25:28.248
They're not worth saving.

1:25:40.385 --> 1:25:42.137
- Thanks.
- Give me a good one.

1:25:42.303 --> 1:25:43.680
- All right.
- Over here.

1:25:43.847 --> 1:25:44.973
And...

1:25:45.056 --> 1:25:46.099
Oh, that's great, man!

1:25:46.182 --> 1:25:47.267
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1:25:47.350 --> 1:25:48.476
-Oh, yeah!
-Nice.

1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:49.811
Good one.
All right, ready? Throw!

1:25:50.353 --> 1:25:51.521
Oh, so close.

1:25:51.604 --> 1:25:52.647
-Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
-Yeah, okay.

1:25:52.814 --> 1:25:54.774
-Watch this.
-Let me see. Let me see it.

1:25:56.067 --> 1:25:57.610
Dad. I'm only a starter.

1:25:57.777 --> 1:25:58.778
Hi.

1:25:58.945 --> 1:26:01.322
-Hello. Can we help you?
-Throw it again.

1:26:01.489 --> 1:26:04.576
Hey, Jack. Ben.

1:26:05.368 --> 1:26:08.746
Hey, guys.
These are my friends from college.

1:26:11.082 --> 1:26:16.087
Uh, this is Sylvia
and, uh, Isaac. That's Isaac.

1:26:16.546 --> 1:26:18.631
-Isaac.
-Dad, that's Superman.

1:26:18.715 --> 1:26:19.841
Dad, that's Superman!

1:26:19.924 --> 1:26:21.050
Jack... That's really funny, Jack.

1:26:21.134 --> 1:26:22.177
No, no! He is Superman.

1:26:22.260 --> 1:26:23.469
That is definitely not Superman.

1:26:23.553 --> 1:26:24.637
I saw him on TV.

1:26:24.721 --> 1:26:27.390
He was in London, fighting a monster.

1:26:27.473 --> 1:26:29.559
And you were with a cape

1:26:29.642 --> 1:26:31.519
and you were shooting
laser beams out of your eyes.

1:26:32.145 --> 1:26:33.646
-I don't wear a cape.
-Oh, sorry.

1:26:33.730 --> 1:26:35.648
Okay, well, we should
just go inside, right?

1:26:35.732 --> 1:26:36.983
Can I call you Clark?

1:26:37.066 --> 1:26:38.234
Is that what you go by now?
Because, you know...

1:26:38.401 --> 1:26:40.028
You've called me worse.

1:26:40.195 --> 1:26:41.738
- You got it, Jack?
- Mm-hmm.

1:26:41.905 --> 1:26:43.865
- Way to go.
- Yes.

1:26:43.948 --> 1:26:45.200
All right.
Show me how it's done.

1:26:45.575 --> 1:26:48.161
Round and round and round
and round and round.

1:26:51.664 --> 1:26:53.374
-Yep, you got it. Keep going.
-Come on.

1:27:02.091 --> 1:27:05.053
Yeah.
Incredibly natural, guys.

1:27:07.805 --> 1:27:09.891
So, after all these years,

1:27:10.058 --> 1:27:12.143
even you fell for Ajak's lies.

1:27:12.310 --> 1:27:14.479
-No need to rub it in.
-Mm.

1:27:15.813 --> 1:27:18.191
It all makes sense
why she wouldn't let us interfere

1:27:18.274 --> 1:27:19.859
with human conflicts.

1:27:20.401 --> 1:27:22.070
Conflicts lead to war,

1:27:22.237 --> 1:27:24.614
and war actually leads to advancement

1:27:24.697 --> 1:27:26.824
in lifesaving technology and medicine.

1:27:27.075 --> 1:27:29.077
So our mission was never to

1:27:29.244 --> 1:27:31.996
make a peaceful or harmonious world,

1:27:32.163 --> 1:27:35.041
but to increase the population
at all costs.

1:27:36.084 --> 1:27:39.087
Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

1:27:39.170 --> 1:27:40.171
That's bleak.

1:27:40.255 --> 1:27:41.923
Well, so is telling
your husband and your child

1:27:42.090 --> 1:27:43.675
that they could be dead within a few days.

1:27:43.841 --> 1:27:45.927
Thought you'd given up on humans.

1:27:46.678 --> 1:27:48.638
I got lucky. Okay?

1:27:50.890 --> 1:27:52.934
I have a family now.

1:27:53.101 --> 1:27:55.436
They give me faith again.

1:27:56.521 --> 1:27:58.523
And I see the good
in humanity in them

1:27:58.606 --> 1:28:00.608
every single day.

1:28:00.775 --> 1:28:02.485
So, look, I cannot help you.

1:28:02.568 --> 1:28:03.778
-I am never leaving them.
-Phastos...

1:28:03.861 --> 1:28:05.029
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1:28:05.113 --> 1:28:06.489
It was wrong for me to use my powers

1:28:06.656 --> 1:28:07.865
without thinking about the consequences

1:28:07.949 --> 1:28:08.950
in the first place.

1:28:09.033 --> 1:28:11.577
So, now, I choose to use my hands

1:28:11.661 --> 1:28:13.496
to fix my child's bicycle, okay?

1:28:14.038 --> 1:28:15.248
Do you?

1:28:16.291 --> 1:28:17.500
I don't use my powers anymore.

1:28:17.667 --> 1:28:18.793
You sure?

1:28:18.876 --> 1:28:20.003
What are you...

1:28:23.548 --> 1:28:25.591
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1:28:25.675 --> 1:28:26.884
My child is right down the hallway!

1:28:27.051 --> 1:28:29.053
That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

1:28:29.220 --> 1:28:30.263
-Oh, my God.
-I bet you've built

1:28:30.346 --> 1:28:31.431
the perfect safe house.

1:28:31.597 --> 1:28:32.682
What is this even made of?

1:28:32.765 --> 1:28:33.933
-Vibranium?
-Don't!

1:28:38.438 --> 1:28:39.939
Fall collection.

1:28:40.106 --> 1:28:41.357
IKEA.

1:28:41.524 --> 1:28:42.525
Ass.

1:28:42.692 --> 1:28:44.193
How did you even
deal with this guy

1:28:44.277 --> 1:28:45.528
for over 5,000 years?

1:28:45.611 --> 1:28:47.030
If you stay here, you might as well

1:28:47.113 --> 1:28:48.156
invite the Deviants to dinner.

1:28:48.323 --> 1:28:49.866
Never mind waiting
for the end of the world.

1:28:50.116 --> 1:28:51.367
He has a point.

1:28:51.534 --> 1:28:53.161
No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up

1:28:53.244 --> 1:28:54.537
in my life and expect me to go with you.

1:28:54.704 --> 1:28:56.706
-I'm not gonna...
-You should go, habibi.

1:28:57.498 --> 1:28:58.791
You want me to go?

1:28:58.958 --> 1:29:00.043
You know what my mom

1:29:00.126 --> 1:29:02.670
would say to you right now,
right?

1:29:06.090 --> 1:29:07.467
He's a chronic procrastinator.

1:29:07.550 --> 1:29:09.594
I'm not leaving you two. No way.

1:29:09.677 --> 1:29:11.471
I'm not happy about it,

1:29:12.138 --> 1:29:13.973
but if there's a chance for us to watch

1:29:14.057 --> 1:29:15.391
Jack grow up to live a life of his own,

1:29:15.558 --> 1:29:17.268
we should take it.

1:29:23.775 --> 1:29:26.778
Why does my heart
Go on beating?

1:29:31.407 --> 1:29:36.204
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

1:29:38.790 --> 1:29:44.379
Don't they know
It's the end of the world?

1:29:45.838 --> 1:29:50.843
It ended when you said goodbye

1:29:51.427 --> 1:29:56.474
Why does my heart
Go on beating?

1:29:58.559 --> 1:30:02.688
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

1:30:05.483 --> 1:30:12.407
Don't they know
It's the end of the world?

1:30:12.573 --> 1:30:19.330
It ended when you said goodbye

1:30:45.523 --> 1:30:47.358
The Domo.

1:30:48.526 --> 1:30:50.027
Wow.

1:30:59.871 --> 1:31:02.957
A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.

1:31:03.791 --> 1:31:06.669
An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.

1:31:06.836 --> 1:31:07.837
What are you doing?

1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:09.380
You know you're creeping us out.
You know that, right?

1:31:09.547 --> 1:31:10.590
-Oh! Oh, God!

1:31:10.673 --> 1:31:12.467
Stay calm, T, please!

1:31:16.262 --> 1:31:18.639
Chips. It's just chips.

1:31:19.056 --> 1:31:20.641
As you can see, being an Eternal

1:31:20.725 --> 1:31:23.394
does not preclude you
from having human emotions

1:31:23.478 --> 1:31:25.188
such as cowardice.

1:31:27.690 --> 1:31:29.275
What has she done?

1:31:29.775 --> 1:31:33.112
Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?

1:31:34.405 --> 1:31:37.658
This is Makkari.
Or should I say Miss Havisham?

1:31:37.825 --> 1:31:39.535
None of us have seen her
for centuries.

1:31:44.373 --> 1:31:45.666
Hmm.

1:32:03.434 --> 1:32:04.477
Is that the Ebony Blade?

1:32:04.644 --> 1:32:05.895
Excalibur.

1:32:07.647 --> 1:32:09.273
Arthur always did have a crush on you.

1:32:20.326 --> 1:32:22.828
That, and the world is ending.

1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:29.377
Have you seen my movies?

1:32:33.005 --> 1:32:34.006
DVD?

1:32:34.382 --> 1:32:35.925
It's all about streaming now.

1:32:36.092 --> 1:32:38.010
You know, what you need is a Kindle.

1:32:38.177 --> 1:32:40.221
Do you know what that is?
It's like a...

1:32:40.846 --> 1:32:42.056
You know, I just realized

1:32:42.139 --> 1:32:43.641
that if you don't know what an iPad is,

1:32:43.808 --> 1:32:45.935
there's almost no way
to explain it.

1:32:50.147 --> 1:32:54.485
So, how did you end up scoring
this Emerald Tablet,

1:32:54.652 --> 1:32:57.572
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

1:33:00.658 --> 1:33:02.034
Did you miss me?

1:33:03.244 --> 1:33:04.787
I'm sorry, what are we watching?
Because this...

1:33:04.954 --> 1:33:05.955
-Is this new?
-Are you two...

1:33:06.038 --> 1:33:07.039
Because I hate it.

1:33:07.206 --> 1:33:08.291
Phastos,

1:33:08.374 --> 1:33:10.167
I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

1:33:10.334 --> 1:33:11.794
Okay, get ready for it.

1:33:15.047 --> 1:33:16.173
Bracelets?

1:33:16.674 --> 1:33:17.758
You made us bracelets?

1:33:17.925 --> 1:33:19.927
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

1:33:20.011 --> 1:33:21.929
Celestials are the most powerful

1:33:22.013 --> 1:33:23.681
energy generators in the universe.

1:33:23.848 --> 1:33:25.224
When Arishem made us,

1:33:25.308 --> 1:33:27.101
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy

1:33:27.310 --> 1:33:28.811
to keep our bodies regenerating.

1:33:28.894 --> 1:33:30.605
The bracelets, in theory,

1:33:30.688 --> 1:33:32.648
shut down our regeneration process.

1:33:32.815 --> 1:33:34.191
And once that happens,

1:33:34.275 --> 1:33:35.901
our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy.

1:33:36.235 --> 1:33:37.236
What for?

1:33:37.403 --> 1:33:40.197
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy,

1:33:40.740 --> 1:33:44.035
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1:33:44.201 --> 1:33:46.871
If I can find a way to connect us all,

1:33:46.954 --> 1:33:48.956
one of us could become immensely powerful,

1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:51.709
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest,

1:33:51.876 --> 1:33:53.044
forming...

1:33:56.589 --> 1:33:57.965
a Uni-Mind.

1:34:01.719 --> 1:34:03.679
"Uni" meaning "one,"
"mind" meaning "mind."

1:34:03.846 --> 1:34:04.847
Oh, no,
we heard you the first time.

1:34:05.014 --> 1:34:06.307
-Terrible name.
-We'll brainstorm...

1:34:06.974 --> 1:34:07.975
"Brainstorm"!

1:34:08.142 --> 1:34:09.644
-That's a way better name!
-No, I invented it,

1:34:09.810 --> 1:34:10.811
so I'm calling it whatever I want.

1:34:16.776 --> 1:34:19.195
We find humans a new home
on another planet.

1:34:19.737 --> 1:34:21.405
Are we building a big ship, too?

1:34:21.489 --> 1:34:22.573
Take a pair of each animal?

1:34:22.657 --> 1:34:24.033
Well, you know
what's never saved the planet?

1:34:24.116 --> 1:34:25.117
Your sarcasm.

1:34:25.242 --> 1:34:27.119
Space colonization
could take decades.

1:34:27.286 --> 1:34:28.621
It can happen quickly with our help.

1:34:28.704 --> 1:34:31.082
What if we end up
accidentally killing Tiamut?

1:34:31.165 --> 1:34:33.542
We could be responsible
for billions of lives

1:34:33.626 --> 1:34:35.127
not being created across the universe.

1:34:35.211 --> 1:34:36.295
Boss, am I right?

1:34:38.047 --> 1:34:39.799
Say something, Ikaris.

1:34:39.965 --> 1:34:41.634
You don't think
we should be doing this.

1:34:48.391 --> 1:34:50.768
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

1:34:52.228 --> 1:34:54.105
Sersi should decide.

1:34:56.732 --> 1:34:58.526
Forget who Ajak chose.

1:34:58.693 --> 1:34:59.694
You're the strongest.

1:34:59.777 --> 1:35:01.862
You should be making this decision.

1:35:02.947 --> 1:35:05.241
Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.

1:35:05.408 --> 1:35:06.784
Sprite.

1:35:15.918 --> 1:35:17.253
Okay, this is not...

1:35:17.336 --> 1:35:18.671
-Ikaris.
-Don't run after him.

1:35:18.754 --> 1:35:20.756
Kingo, I... You guys.

1:35:21.173 --> 1:35:23.634
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

1:35:23.801 --> 1:35:25.720
I used to hear her complaining
even when she wasn't there.

1:35:25.803 --> 1:35:27.304
I'm okay, Kingo.

1:35:27.388 --> 1:35:29.140
If you think we should
do this, I trust you.

1:35:29.223 --> 1:35:31.892
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1:35:33.894 --> 1:35:35.396
What did you say?

1:35:35.646 --> 1:35:38.107
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1:35:39.859 --> 1:35:41.068
I'm not who you think I am.

1:36:21.150 --> 1:36:22.777
How long do we have?

1:36:23.194 --> 1:36:24.779
Seven days.

1:36:25.321 --> 1:36:26.614
Good.

1:36:28.199 --> 1:36:30.993
-We completed our mission.

1:36:33.037 --> 1:36:34.580
Where is she?

1:36:34.747 --> 1:36:35.748
London.

1:36:36.582 --> 1:36:38.167
She has a good life there.

1:36:38.334 --> 1:36:40.419
I'm sure she's missed you.

1:36:40.586 --> 1:36:41.712
If I'd gone back to her,

1:36:41.921 --> 1:36:43.923
I would only have told her the truth.

1:36:45.758 --> 1:36:47.468
She would've suffered

1:36:47.551 --> 1:36:50.054
knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

1:36:50.221 --> 1:36:51.388
Ikaris.

1:36:52.348 --> 1:36:54.016
We have to tell them the truth.

1:36:54.183 --> 1:36:55.601
What?

1:36:55.976 --> 1:36:57.728
-Why?
-Because together

1:36:57.812 --> 1:36:59.772
we might be able to stop the emergence.

1:37:00.523 --> 1:37:02.191
"Stop the emergence"?

1:37:02.358 --> 1:37:03.359
Listen...

1:37:03.526 --> 1:37:04.693
Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...

1:37:04.777 --> 1:37:05.778
Listen to me, Ikaris.

1:37:05.861 --> 1:37:08.739
I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.

1:37:08.823 --> 1:37:11.492
And I have never doubted him.

1:37:11.575 --> 1:37:13.202
-Until now.
-Why now?

1:37:14.161 --> 1:37:15.538
Why now?

1:37:20.417 --> 1:37:22.586
Five years ago, Thanos erased

1:37:22.711 --> 1:37:25.047
half of the population of the universe.

1:37:26.507 --> 1:37:28.342
Delayed the emergence.

1:37:30.386 --> 1:37:32.346
But the people of this planet

1:37:32.513 --> 1:37:35.766
brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.

1:37:36.976 --> 1:37:40.104
You know, after I let you all go,

1:37:40.271 --> 1:37:43.148
I traveled the world, living among them.

1:37:43.315 --> 1:37:46.902
I have seen them fight and lie and kill,

1:37:47.194 --> 1:37:49.530
but I have also seen them

1:37:49.697 --> 1:37:52.116
laugh and love.

1:37:52.283 --> 1:37:56.287
I've seen them create and dream.

1:37:59.206 --> 1:38:00.583
This planet

1:38:01.375 --> 1:38:02.960
and these people...

1:38:04.420 --> 1:38:06.088
have changed me.

1:38:07.798 --> 1:38:11.844
The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

1:38:12.011 --> 1:38:13.637
Not this time.

1:38:15.472 --> 1:38:17.182
I trust you, Ajak.

1:38:21.270 --> 1:38:23.105
I'll follow you to the end,

1:38:24.607 --> 1:38:26.108
as I always have.

1:38:26.275 --> 1:38:27.651
Thank you.

1:38:29.278 --> 1:38:31.238
We have to bring
everyone back together.

1:38:33.866 --> 1:38:36.201
There's something
I have to show you first.

1:38:46.837 --> 1:38:48.505
It's just up ahead.

1:38:56.013 --> 1:38:58.515
They must have been trapped
in the ice for centuries

1:38:58.599 --> 1:38:59.934
and broke free last week

1:39:00.017 --> 1:39:01.602
when the glacier started to melt

1:39:01.685 --> 1:39:04.396
as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

1:39:05.689 --> 1:39:08.025
They killed an entire company
of oil workers.

1:39:08.859 --> 1:39:10.486
I tracked them here.

1:39:13.989 --> 1:39:16.700
I suspected you might
have changed your mind.

1:39:17.493 --> 1:39:19.036
I can't let you betray Arishem.

1:39:21.205 --> 1:39:23.290
Why don't you just kill me yourself?

1:39:23.457 --> 1:39:24.541
When the others realize

1:39:24.625 --> 1:39:26.460
something is happening to the Earth,

1:39:27.127 --> 1:39:28.295
they'll come to you.

1:39:29.004 --> 1:39:30.339
When they find your body,

1:39:30.422 --> 1:39:31.882
they'll know the Deviants are back.

1:39:32.299 --> 1:39:34.969
It'll keep them busy until the emergence.

1:39:36.679 --> 1:39:39.014
I've been loyal to you, Ajak.

1:39:39.348 --> 1:39:41.809
Kept your secret for centuries,

1:39:42.142 --> 1:39:44.103
lied to everyone I cared about,

1:39:45.104 --> 1:39:48.607
but never have I doubted my purpose

1:39:48.691 --> 1:39:49.692
to serve the Celestials.

1:39:50.401 --> 1:39:52.319
Oh, Ikaris.

1:39:57.282 --> 1:40:00.119
I've led you down the wrong path.

1:40:00.911 --> 1:40:02.329
It's the only path I know.

1:42:56.086 --> 1:42:58.046
Thought I'd find you here.

1:42:58.547 --> 1:43:00.966
I've thought about this place a lot.

1:43:02.176 --> 1:43:04.511
Amazing how things change over time.

1:43:05.095 --> 1:43:07.222
Maybe we're the ones
who've changed.

1:43:10.142 --> 1:43:12.019
I know you don't agree with our plan.

1:43:13.061 --> 1:43:14.438
I've always thought of the Celestials

1:43:14.521 --> 1:43:16.148
like the ocean.

1:43:17.941 --> 1:43:21.445
They give life and they take life away
without bias.

1:43:21.862 --> 1:43:22.988
If they were gone,

1:43:23.071 --> 1:43:24.573
this universe would eventually end.

1:43:25.073 --> 1:43:26.158
What you're trying to do

1:43:26.241 --> 1:43:27.492
is free humanity from the natural order.

1:43:27.659 --> 1:43:29.661
It's not natural to allow all life

1:43:29.745 --> 1:43:31.455
on an entire planet to be destroyed.

1:43:32.164 --> 1:43:34.124
Arishem's way is archaic and violent.

1:43:34.208 --> 1:43:36.043
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

1:43:36.835 --> 1:43:37.836
It'll all end soon.

1:43:38.003 --> 1:43:40.839
Except there is no end, is there?

1:43:41.089 --> 1:43:43.592
We'd carry on without our memories

1:43:43.759 --> 1:43:45.302
or free will

1:43:45.469 --> 1:43:47.054
for eternity.

1:43:52.768 --> 1:43:54.144
You're afraid.

1:43:54.561 --> 1:43:57.189
I wouldn't mind leaving this world.

1:43:57.898 --> 1:43:59.858
I only wish that when we do,

1:44:01.443 --> 1:44:03.695
I would be able to remember you.

1:44:05.781 --> 1:44:08.242
I'm in love with you, Sersi.

1:44:08.700 --> 1:44:11.578
I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.

1:44:17.751 --> 1:44:18.835
Ikaris.

1:44:43.694 --> 1:44:44.987
Sersi?

1:44:48.991 --> 1:44:51.159
It's started.

1:44:53.870 --> 1:44:55.539
Oh, no. My God.

1:44:56.123 --> 1:44:57.124
What about the Uni-Mind?

1:44:57.582 --> 1:44:58.834
I haven't figured out a way

1:44:58.959 --> 1:45:00.544
to connect us, but I'm close.

1:45:00.627 --> 1:45:02.254
-I'm very, very close.
-How much longer?

1:45:02.337 --> 1:45:04.339
I don't know, Sersi!

1:45:07.551 --> 1:45:08.885
Find the point of emergence.

1:45:32.784 --> 1:45:35.329
You always knew
the end was coming.

1:45:35.495 --> 1:45:38.123
It must be a relief.

1:45:38.290 --> 1:45:40.292
That Deviant is still tracking us.

1:45:41.001 --> 1:45:43.545
Revenge won't bring peace
for you, Thena.

1:45:44.046 --> 1:45:46.256
But killing it might.

1:45:59.353 --> 1:46:00.771
Ikaris?

1:46:02.189 --> 1:46:03.648
What are you doing?

1:46:09.613 --> 1:46:12.240
I wanted you to leave
this world in peace.

1:46:13.617 --> 1:46:15.994
Without knowing
about the emergence.

1:46:16.370 --> 1:46:17.954
But I failed.

1:46:21.792 --> 1:46:23.502
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

1:46:30.717 --> 1:46:32.052
I'm close to figuring it out.

1:46:36.556 --> 1:46:37.808
Boss, what are you doing?

1:46:37.891 --> 1:46:39.518
I've let this go on
long enough.

1:46:39.684 --> 1:46:41.603
-Don't hurt him!

1:46:42.729 --> 1:46:44.314
He lied to us.

1:46:45.190 --> 1:46:46.942
He already knew about the emergence.

1:46:47.651 --> 1:46:48.985
No, he didn't.

1:46:49.152 --> 1:46:51.863
Ajak told me everything
when we left Babylon.

1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:54.241
What?

1:46:55.242 --> 1:46:57.494
You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

1:46:57.577 --> 1:46:58.620
No.

1:46:59.996 --> 1:47:02.666
I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

1:47:02.999 --> 1:47:04.668
If Ajak wanted you to take her place,

1:47:04.751 --> 1:47:06.294
why did she choose me?

1:47:11.258 --> 1:47:12.509
What have you done?

1:47:13.844 --> 1:47:15.095
He killed her.

1:47:18.348 --> 1:47:19.349
I had to.

1:47:20.642 --> 1:47:22.519
She loved you.

1:47:25.313 --> 1:47:26.982
-Did she?
-She loved you.

1:47:29.359 --> 1:47:31.695
Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?

1:47:32.696 --> 1:47:34.698
To know that one day all this would end?

1:47:36.825 --> 1:47:38.326
To keep on lying to you?

1:47:40.620 --> 1:47:42.831
If we gave humanity the choice,

1:47:42.914 --> 1:47:45.292
how many of them would be willing to die

1:47:45.375 --> 1:47:48.003
so that billions more could be born?

1:47:48.170 --> 1:47:50.547
We're not giving them a choice.

1:47:51.339 --> 1:47:53.925
Is this why you're willing to kill?

1:47:55.677 --> 1:47:58.472
You are so pathetic!

1:47:58.763 --> 1:48:01.600
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

1:48:01.683 --> 1:48:04.728
I exist for Arishem.

1:48:04.895 --> 1:48:06.271
As do you.

1:48:06.646 --> 1:48:07.856
It's who you are.

1:48:07.939 --> 1:48:10.942
I wouldn't change a single thing

1:48:11.026 --> 1:48:12.652
about who I am.

1:48:12.736 --> 1:48:14.696
Born or made.

1:48:14.779 --> 1:48:17.240
But I do not exist for Arishem,

1:48:17.324 --> 1:48:19.284
I exist for my family!

1:48:19.451 --> 1:48:21.870
Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

1:48:24.915 --> 1:48:26.124
- No!
- Makkari!

1:48:28.460 --> 1:48:29.920
Get out of here!

1:48:32.964 --> 1:48:34.341
Kingo.

1:48:42.265 --> 1:48:44.851
You do not turn against your family.

1:48:45.769 --> 1:48:48.146
Gilgamesh died because of you.

1:48:50.065 --> 1:48:51.525
You won't succeed against me.

1:48:52.526 --> 1:48:55.111
And I will kill every one of you
if I have to.

1:49:02.827 --> 1:49:03.954
Wait.

1:49:04.913 --> 1:49:05.956
I'm going with you.

1:49:06.122 --> 1:49:07.165
Sprite...

1:49:08.959 --> 1:49:10.001
What is this?

1:49:27.519 --> 1:49:28.895
Because she loves him.

1:49:31.147 --> 1:49:33.608
Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?

1:49:34.776 --> 1:49:36.444
He really fooled us, didn't he?

1:49:37.821 --> 1:49:39.114
Karun, let's go.

1:49:39.656 --> 1:49:40.991
Wait, where the hell are you going?

1:49:41.074 --> 1:49:42.325
I can't help you guys.

1:49:43.952 --> 1:49:45.579
I still think Ikaris is right.

1:49:45.745 --> 1:49:48.248
So, that's it, huh?
Just gonna follow him?

1:49:49.583 --> 1:49:51.710
I love the people of this planet.

1:49:52.043 --> 1:49:54.421
But if you stop this emergence,

1:49:54.504 --> 1:49:56.965
you are preventing so many
other worlds like this one

1:49:57.048 --> 1:49:58.174
from being created.

1:49:59.342 --> 1:50:01.177
I still have faith in Arishem.

1:50:01.636 --> 1:50:04.806
But I refuse to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.

1:50:10.770 --> 1:50:13.356
Even with my help, we're no match.

1:50:14.107 --> 1:50:15.775
It's Ikaris.

1:50:19.154 --> 1:50:20.155
But...

1:50:20.947 --> 1:50:22.824
I hope to see you on the next planet.

1:50:50.435 --> 1:50:51.436
Look,

1:50:52.145 --> 1:50:55.148
if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris,

1:50:55.940 --> 1:50:58.193
we'll need to have a backup plan.

1:50:58.276 --> 1:50:59.694
All of our powers,
even if they're amplified,

1:50:59.861 --> 1:51:01.488
are not enough to kill a Celestial, so...

1:51:01.571 --> 1:51:04.115
Well, Sersi did turn
a Deviant into a tree.

1:51:05.116 --> 1:51:06.201
I'm sorry, what?

1:51:06.660 --> 1:51:07.952
You didn't wanna tell me that?

1:51:10.413 --> 1:51:11.831
I don't know how it happened, okay?

1:51:11.998 --> 1:51:14.417
And I'm pretty sure
I couldn't do it again.

1:51:14.584 --> 1:51:17.128
Well, now is the time
to try, don't you think?

1:51:17.295 --> 1:51:19.255
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

1:51:19.422 --> 1:51:22.634
Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep,
not to kill it.

1:51:22.801 --> 1:51:24.177
I can't kill a Celestial.

1:51:24.344 --> 1:51:25.970
Sersi. Sersi.

1:51:26.137 --> 1:51:27.514
We can't!

1:51:33.478 --> 1:51:34.604
We can't.

1:51:34.771 --> 1:51:36.314
It's okay, Sersi.

1:51:37.649 --> 1:51:39.025
I got this.

1:51:55.208 --> 1:51:56.835
There's no time for that.

1:51:58.002 --> 1:52:00.714
I didn't see the lies
right in front of me.

1:52:02.006 --> 1:52:04.884
I'm not even sure
why Ajak chose me to lead.

1:52:06.428 --> 1:52:07.971
I asked Gilgamesh once

1:52:08.471 --> 1:52:10.807
why he chose to protect me.

1:52:11.224 --> 1:52:12.642
He said,

1:52:13.101 --> 1:52:16.438
"When you love something,
you protect it.

1:52:17.147 --> 1:52:21.067
"It is the most natural thing
in the world."

1:52:24.446 --> 1:52:28.658
You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

1:52:30.368 --> 1:52:35.790
So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

1:52:38.293 --> 1:52:39.586
Sersi.

1:52:41.838 --> 1:52:43.173
Get up.

1:52:51.097 --> 1:52:53.558
Ajak chose you for a reason.

1:52:58.521 --> 1:52:59.773
Sersi!

1:53:00.231 --> 1:53:01.274
Sersi!

1:53:01.441 --> 1:53:03.026
Oh, Sersi. We need you!

1:53:03.193 --> 1:53:04.736
I already gave that speech.

1:53:04.903 --> 1:53:05.945
What?

1:53:06.112 --> 1:53:07.363
You did... What...

1:53:07.530 --> 1:53:10.533
Sersi, the sphere inside of you,

1:53:10.700 --> 1:53:12.202
it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

1:53:12.368 --> 1:53:15.497
Maybe I can repurpose it

1:53:15.663 --> 1:53:17.916
and create a connection between, uh,

1:53:18.416 --> 1:53:19.417
well, all of us.

1:53:19.876 --> 1:53:22.170
And that can activate the Uni-Mind.

1:53:22.337 --> 1:53:24.005
-Great.
-Yeah.

1:53:24.714 --> 1:53:25.924
But, um...

1:53:26.007 --> 1:53:28.843
I have to take it out of you.

1:53:31.763 --> 1:53:32.972
Okay.

1:53:34.474 --> 1:53:35.558
Do it.

1:53:37.185 --> 1:53:38.311
Okay.

1:53:46.319 --> 1:53:47.904
Don't kill her.

1:53:48.071 --> 1:53:49.280
Thena...

1:53:50.532 --> 1:53:51.574
-Do it.

1:54:05.213 --> 1:54:06.506
Will it work?

1:54:11.219 --> 1:54:12.637
It has to.

1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:06.274
I'm glad you're here.

1:55:10.445 --> 1:55:12.030
Thank you, Sprite.

1:55:27.045 --> 1:55:28.796
Protect the emergence.

1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:30.632
You're really gonna kill them?

1:55:38.473 --> 1:55:40.016
Where's Druig?

1:55:40.558 --> 1:55:41.768
He's busy.

1:55:41.935 --> 1:55:44.020
Thena, play nice.

1:55:47.815 --> 1:55:49.192
You've never had to fight me.

1:55:49.359 --> 1:55:50.485
But I've always wanted to.

1:55:58.910 --> 1:56:01.120
It's time to put a god to sleep.

1:57:08.604 --> 1:57:10.440
I should've done this
five centuries ago.

1:57:57.779 --> 1:57:59.280
Druig's gone.

1:58:00.198 --> 1:58:01.574
It's over.

1:59:08.891 --> 1:59:09.892
Phastos.

1:59:14.313 --> 1:59:16.107
I have to try and stop this.

1:59:16.274 --> 1:59:17.984
I need to get closer to Tiamut.

1:59:18.151 --> 1:59:20.111
-Keep Ikaris busy.
-We've got you.

1:59:20.278 --> 1:59:21.279
Go.

1:59:29.245 --> 1:59:30.872
-Enough.

2:00:01.194 --> 2:00:02.445
Thena, stop!

2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:35.937
Why are you helping Ikaris?

2:00:36.812 --> 2:00:38.189
We can't
let it absorb our powers.

2:00:39.523 --> 2:00:40.650
Too late.

2:00:42.276 --> 2:00:44.904
Thena, he's trying
to goad you. Don't...

2:01:00.795 --> 2:01:02.129
-Makkari!

2:01:10.972 --> 2:01:12.181
Where's Sersi?

2:01:12.556 --> 2:01:14.725
You always did
underestimate her.

2:01:16.185 --> 2:01:17.436
Oh, no.

2:01:18.271 --> 2:01:19.897
Not so fast.

2:01:24.318 --> 2:01:25.695
Boss.

2:01:29.865 --> 2:01:30.866
I don't know about you,

2:01:30.950 --> 2:01:32.743
but this is really satisfying, right?

2:01:32.827 --> 2:01:35.246
Let me go, Phastos!
I can't let her do this!

2:01:35.413 --> 2:01:36.706
I don't think so.

2:01:37.123 --> 2:01:38.374
I've been wanting to clip your wings

2:01:38.457 --> 2:01:40.584
for a long time, Ikaris!

2:01:53.889 --> 2:01:54.890
Thena.

2:01:57.601 --> 2:02:00.521
Oh, you've changed.

2:02:01.897 --> 2:02:03.524
You're broken.

2:02:04.317 --> 2:02:05.818
Damaged.

2:02:06.402 --> 2:02:08.237
Useless.

2:02:10.489 --> 2:02:14.327
You can't protect any of them.

2:02:28.424 --> 2:02:29.800
Sersi.

2:02:34.555 --> 2:02:37.558
You're not powerful enough
to do this.

2:02:37.641 --> 2:02:39.477
And you won't.

2:02:39.977 --> 2:02:41.729
You're not a killer.

2:02:41.896 --> 2:02:43.397
Maybe I've changed.

2:02:43.939 --> 2:02:46.400
And is this really who you are, Sprite?

2:02:46.567 --> 2:02:49.195
Are you really willing to let
everyone on this planet die?

2:02:57.995 --> 2:02:59.789
I'm sorry, Sersi.

2:03:12.259 --> 2:03:14.470
I've always envied you, Sersi.

2:03:16.555 --> 2:03:18.599
'Cause you get to live
as one of them.

2:03:19.100 --> 2:03:20.184
And I never could.

2:03:21.435 --> 2:03:23.687
You know why I hated
living with humans?

2:03:24.271 --> 2:03:25.564
Because they reminded me of things

2:03:25.648 --> 2:03:27.066
I didn't even know I wanted.

2:03:27.566 --> 2:03:28.984
Because of them, now I wanna know

2:03:29.068 --> 2:03:30.903
what it feels like to grow up.

2:03:32.029 --> 2:03:33.739
To fall in love.

2:03:34.532 --> 2:03:36.158
To have a family.

2:03:37.451 --> 2:03:41.122
And to know, in the end, I've lived.

2:03:48.295 --> 2:03:49.422
It's all over now.

2:03:50.256 --> 2:03:52.591
We get to start over somewhere new.

2:03:56.512 --> 2:03:58.139
Well, that was very moving.

2:03:58.305 --> 2:03:59.557
Druig.

2:04:05.271 --> 2:04:06.814
I can't do this.

2:04:10.443 --> 2:04:12.319
This is your fight now.

2:04:56.864 --> 2:04:58.073
Thena.

2:04:59.450 --> 2:05:00.701
It's me.

2:05:01.285 --> 2:05:02.453
Gilgamesh.

2:05:03.871 --> 2:05:04.914
Look at me.

2:05:05.956 --> 2:05:07.249
Gilgamesh?

2:05:07.416 --> 2:05:08.959
Stay here.

2:05:11.670 --> 2:05:12.922
Say it.

2:05:13.464 --> 2:05:15.132
Stay here.

2:05:16.008 --> 2:05:17.718
You'll be okay.

2:05:19.762 --> 2:05:21.597
Give me your hand.

2:05:34.860 --> 2:05:36.070
Ah, it's a shame.

2:05:38.113 --> 2:05:39.740
You and I,

2:05:40.324 --> 2:05:42.368
we're just tools of a god.

2:05:43.619 --> 2:05:46.830
Built to kill.

2:05:49.667 --> 2:05:50.918
Thena.

2:05:54.380 --> 2:05:55.756
Remember.

2:06:26.203 --> 2:06:27.788
I remember.

2:07:57.211 --> 2:07:58.671
Come on, Sersi.

2:07:59.713 --> 2:08:00.798
Come on.

2:10:10.052 --> 2:10:11.804
It's beautiful, isn't it?

2:12:40.786 --> 2:12:42.329
I'm sorry.

2:12:44.039 --> 2:12:45.499
I know.

2:14:01.199 --> 2:14:02.242
How?

2:14:02.701 --> 2:14:04.077
How did you do it?

2:14:05.203 --> 2:14:08.457
When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

2:14:08.874 --> 2:14:11.251
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

2:14:11.418 --> 2:14:12.753
I always wondered how we survived

2:14:12.919 --> 2:14:15.589
the destruction of other planets
that we were on.

2:14:15.964 --> 2:14:18.467
By being connected to
the Celestial as it emerged.

2:15:22.114 --> 2:15:23.323
Is he gone?

2:15:32.999 --> 2:15:34.251
Sprite.

2:15:36.753 --> 2:15:39.339
I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.

2:15:40.423 --> 2:15:42.592
I think I can make you human.

2:15:43.969 --> 2:15:46.888
All the things you said you wanted,
you can have them.

2:15:47.055 --> 2:15:49.891
But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.

2:15:50.058 --> 2:15:51.101
Are you ready for that?

2:15:53.520 --> 2:15:54.938
I am.

2:16:32.350 --> 2:16:33.393
The sudden appearance

2:16:33.476 --> 2:16:36.021
of an enormous stone figure
in the Indian Ocean

2:16:36.146 --> 2:16:39.441
has left more questions
than answers for authorities.

2:16:39.816 --> 2:16:41.693
U.S. and Australian naval ships

2:16:41.776 --> 2:16:43.320
are maintaining defensive positions,

2:16:43.486 --> 2:16:44.487
but at this...

2:16:44.654 --> 2:16:46.531
You guys did that?

2:16:47.324 --> 2:16:49.618
I love you so much.

2:16:56.917 --> 2:16:58.293
Are you okay?

2:16:59.211 --> 2:17:01.213
I get confused sometimes.

2:17:01.421 --> 2:17:03.465
Yeah. Me, too.

2:17:06.051 --> 2:17:08.303
So, Dad said
you're the goddess Athena.

2:17:08.470 --> 2:17:10.555
"Thena." Drop the "A."

2:17:11.723 --> 2:17:12.974
-Oh.
-Hmm.

2:17:13.433 --> 2:17:15.268
What's your superpower?

2:17:19.147 --> 2:17:21.399
Um, can you just...
Look... One second.

2:17:22.150 --> 2:17:23.777
Okay. All right.

2:17:24.319 --> 2:17:26.029
See, that thing is... Okay.

2:17:26.196 --> 2:17:27.697
Almost gave you a shave
and a haircut, didn't she?

2:17:27.864 --> 2:17:29.324
Stand behind me, actually.

2:17:29.532 --> 2:17:30.742
Um, you remember earmuffs?

2:17:30.825 --> 2:17:33.411
Remember how we practiced earmuffs?
Thank you so much.

2:17:35.580 --> 2:17:37.207
You know that your babysitting privileges

2:17:37.290 --> 2:17:38.291
are completely revoked, right?

2:17:38.458 --> 2:17:39.501
Like, it's done.

2:17:40.001 --> 2:17:41.878
Thank you.
Violence... Hey.

2:17:42.045 --> 2:17:43.797
Violence is never the answer.

2:17:43.880 --> 2:17:44.881
-Right, T?
-Hmm.

2:17:45.048 --> 2:17:47.676
You gotta always use
your brain, hmm?

2:17:47.842 --> 2:17:49.552
Like you did fighting on the beach?

2:17:49.719 --> 2:17:50.971
Your dad

2:17:51.304 --> 2:17:53.473
spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy

2:17:53.556 --> 2:17:54.641
and he had no choice but to

2:17:54.724 --> 2:17:57.185
-listen to me, so no violence.

2:17:59.396 --> 2:18:00.897
When are you guys leaving?
When is that happening?

2:18:01.064 --> 2:18:02.941
That's happening soon, right?

2:18:03.108 --> 2:18:04.317
-Ah, yes, there's Druig.

2:18:04.401 --> 2:18:05.944
-Don't go anywhere near him.
-Oh!

2:18:06.486 --> 2:18:07.612
-Yeah!

2:18:10.031 --> 2:18:11.366
Okay,
that's far enough, Jack.

2:18:11.533 --> 2:18:13.868
Wow, Dad,
the Domo's so cool.

2:18:14.035 --> 2:18:15.662
Your dad fixed that
with his bare hands.

2:18:15.745 --> 2:18:17.372
Can we go to space, too, one day?

2:18:17.455 --> 2:18:20.083
Let's wait till you get
your learner's permit, okay?

2:18:20.792 --> 2:18:22.210
Hey, Phastos.

2:18:23.044 --> 2:18:24.421
Take care.

2:18:24.796 --> 2:18:26.381
This world is lucky to have you.

2:18:27.215 --> 2:18:28.842
Thank you.

2:18:29.009 --> 2:18:30.677
I know you're not a hugger, so...

2:18:33.847 --> 2:18:36.391
Okay.

2:18:37.851 --> 2:18:41.938
You think when we find
the other Eternals out there,

2:18:42.105 --> 2:18:45.108
that they'll accept the truth
the way we did?

2:19:03.043 --> 2:19:04.753
Told you that thing
was addictive.

2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:06.963
Please visit?

2:19:07.589 --> 2:19:08.798
I'll try.

2:19:09.382 --> 2:19:10.717
When I get time off from school.

2:19:10.884 --> 2:19:12.302
Oh, wow. Listen,
it's gonna be good for you

2:19:12.385 --> 2:19:13.553
to be in a human environment.

2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:15.513
You'll pick up some social skills.

2:19:16.056 --> 2:19:17.390
Oh, you didn't think you needed those?

2:19:18.808 --> 2:19:20.810
That explains so much.

2:19:30.528 --> 2:19:32.072
Gonna miss you.

2:19:32.614 --> 2:19:33.823
Me, too.

2:19:37.494 --> 2:19:38.620
Madam.

2:19:39.079 --> 2:19:40.372
Thanks, Karun.

2:19:40.955 --> 2:19:43.416
Sometimes I wonder
if we did the right thing.

2:19:45.043 --> 2:19:46.127
Killing Tiamut.

2:19:46.294 --> 2:19:48.046
It's too late for that.

2:19:48.254 --> 2:19:50.215
But you followed your heart.

2:19:50.382 --> 2:19:51.841
We all did.

2:19:54.052 --> 2:19:55.053
Even Ikaris.

2:20:02.602 --> 2:20:04.562
Looks like someone's waiting for you.

2:20:05.730 --> 2:20:07.857
He's a lot cuter in person.

2:20:10.276 --> 2:20:11.361
So, after all that,

2:20:11.444 --> 2:20:13.488
you still can't change me into a giraffe?

2:20:14.155 --> 2:20:17.826
Well, I could next time
I'm connected to a Celestial

2:20:17.992 --> 2:20:20.203
during an emergence
whilst performing a Uni-Mind.

2:20:20.370 --> 2:20:23.164
Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.

2:20:27.127 --> 2:20:28.545
What'll you do now?

2:20:28.711 --> 2:20:30.004
Not sure.

2:20:30.171 --> 2:20:32.173
This planet's my home, but...

2:20:33.925 --> 2:20:36.636
I can't pretend to be human anymore.

2:20:43.184 --> 2:20:44.769
I love you, Sersi.

2:20:46.312 --> 2:20:47.397
I don't care what you are.

2:21:01.202 --> 2:21:03.830
Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

2:21:03.997 --> 2:21:07.000
I have no more secrets, I promise.

2:21:07.250 --> 2:21:08.751
Actually,

2:21:08.918 --> 2:21:11.212
I have one I want to tell you.

2:21:12.297 --> 2:21:15.258
-What is it?

2:21:15.800 --> 2:21:18.303
It turns out my family history is...

2:21:19.220 --> 2:21:20.805
complicated.

2:21:24.184 --> 2:21:25.560
Sersi?

2:21:26.352 --> 2:21:27.854
Sersi, what's wrong?

2:21:29.314 --> 2:21:30.648
Sersi?

2:21:54.506 --> 2:21:55.882
Sersi?

2:21:56.758 --> 2:21:58.009
Sersi?

2:21:58.885 --> 2:22:01.054
Sersi!

2:22:15.818 --> 2:22:19.197
You have chosen
to sacrifice a Celestial

2:22:19.572 --> 2:22:21.991
for the people of this planet.

2:22:23.284 --> 2:22:25.078
I will spare them,

2:22:25.245 --> 2:22:29.958
but your memories will show
if they are worthy to live.

2:22:31.459 --> 2:22:35.672
And I will return for judgment.

2:22:51.020 --> 2:22:53.064
You all right, Ted?

2:22:54.774 --> 2:22:56.651
-Did you see that?

2:26:06.257 --> 2:26:07.592
Arishem.

2:26:09.844 --> 2:26:11.554
We have to go back.

2:26:24.484 --> 2:26:25.818
What?

2:26:38.706 --> 2:26:39.791
Wow.

2:26:39.999 --> 2:26:43.294
Aah! My ears. My eyes are numb.

2:26:43.461 --> 2:26:46.297
No more drunk teleporting for you.

2:26:46.422 --> 2:26:47.507
-Um...

2:26:47.632 --> 2:26:48.800
Hang on, hang on.

2:26:54.680 --> 2:26:56.098
Behold,

2:26:56.766 --> 2:26:59.352
the royal prince of Titan,

2:26:59.519 --> 2:27:02.730
brother of Thanos,
the Knave of Hearts,

2:27:02.897 --> 2:27:05.149
-defeater...

2:27:05.316 --> 2:27:07.276
-...of Black Robert...
-Roger.

2:27:07.693 --> 2:27:09.111
Oh.

2:27:09.195 --> 2:27:11.656
Defeater of Black Roger.

2:27:12.281 --> 2:27:13.574
The great adventurer,

2:27:14.116 --> 2:27:18.037
Starfox of Mystery Planet.

2:27:18.621 --> 2:27:20.832
What a pleasure
to make your acquaintance,

2:27:21.374 --> 2:27:23.251
my fellow Eternals.

2:27:24.460 --> 2:27:25.545
You know, you really don't have to

2:27:25.628 --> 2:27:26.796
do the whole thing every time.

2:27:26.963 --> 2:27:28.172
Everything you do is impressive.

2:27:28.339 --> 2:27:29.340
What am I gonna leave off the list?

2:27:29.423 --> 2:27:30.591
-No, I know it's impressive.
-Who are you?

2:27:32.844 --> 2:27:33.970
I'm Eros.

2:27:34.470 --> 2:27:35.513
This is Pip.

2:27:35.930 --> 2:27:39.100
And you are as beautiful
as legends say, Thena.

2:27:39.475 --> 2:27:40.726
What do you want, lads?

2:27:40.810 --> 2:27:42.478
Pip and I are here to help, aren't we?

2:27:47.942 --> 2:27:50.027
Your friends are in big trouble.

2:27:51.696 --> 2:27:53.281
And we know where to find them.

2:34:45.109 --> 2:34:46.568
You can do this.

2:34:47.194 --> 2:34:49.655
You can do this.

2:35:13.929 --> 2:35:15.431
I'm sorry.

2:35:17.599 --> 2:35:19.226
I have to try.

2:35:33.324 --> 2:35:35.909
Sure you're ready
for that, Mr. Whitman?
