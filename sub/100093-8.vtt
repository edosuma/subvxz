What do you have for me?

20:39.113 --> 20:41.115
Well, Your Honor, during
the course of our discovery,

20:41.157 --> 20:43.451
we ran across some evidence
that Mr. Blackwood

20:43.493 --> 20:46.788
has been drilling an illegal
tunnel through federal land,

20:46.829 --> 20:49.916
and stealing water from
a protected federal reservoir.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.542
And this evidence

20:51.584 --> 20:53.378
goes straight
to the heart of our case,

20:53.419 --> 20:56.005
details a ongoing
criminal conspiracy

20:56.047 --> 20:59.217
to steal water,
first from the state...

20:59.258 --> 21:02.595
and when that wasn't enough,
from federal land, too.

21:02.637 --> 21:05.348
Ms. Sen,
what do you know about this?

21:05.390 --> 21:08.393
Your Honor, during the course
of this litigation,

21:08.434 --> 21:10.395

of a shell company

21:10.436 --> 21:12.397

Diana Blackwood,

21:12.438 --> 21:13.856

21:13.898 --> 21:16.526
Upon further investigation,
he discovered

21:16.567 --> 21:18.236
that Fer-de-lance
is solely responsible

21:18.277 --> 21:19.654
for this tunneling project.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.656
My client,
nor any of his companies,

21:21.698 --> 21:24.951
have had any involvement
or prior knowledge of said

21:24.993 --> 21:26.661
- tunneling project.
- So she was doing this

21:26.703 --> 21:28.663
- without your knowledge.
- BLACKWOOD: She's a grown-up.

21:28.705 --> 21:31.207
I'm not responsible
for her actions.

to the bigger point.

in this class action lawsuit.
