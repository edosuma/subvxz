00:02.095 --> 00:03.529
Previously
on "The Originals"...

00:03.530 --> 00:05.629
This town was my home once.
I want it back.

00:05.630 --> 00:08.301
Our community
is under attack.

00:08.302 --> 00:10.102
Resurrected witches
with vast power?

00:10.103 --> 00:11.261
It's the harvest.

00:11.262 --> 00:13.430
Four girls were
meant to die

00:13.431 --> 00:14.707
and be reborn.

00:14.708 --> 00:16.709
Someone jacked
that power.

00:16.710 --> 00:18.544
I believe that when
you love someone

00:18.545 --> 00:20.713
and that person
loves you in return,

00:20.714 --> 00:22.147
you're uniquely
vulnerable.

00:22.148 --> 00:24.116
Celeste, she died
because of me.

00:24.117 --> 00:25.651
I'd appreciate it if you'd
call me by my real name...

00:26.150 --> 00:27.253
Celeste.

00:27.254 --> 00:28.921
What about Hayley?

00:28.922 --> 00:30.089
None of my treachery
will harm this family

00:30.090 --> 00:31.791
as much as your
feelings for her.

00:31.792 --> 00:33.526
This blade contains

00:33.527 --> 00:35.126
all the power I harvested
from the vampires.

00:35.127 --> 00:36.594
It will do
things worse than death.

00:36.595 --> 00:38.705
And are you ready
for the final offering?

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.869 --> 01:18.369
Someone help me.

01:20.272 --> 01:22.174
Thank you all for coming.

01:22.175 --> 01:24.842
It means more
than I can tell you.

01:24.843 --> 01:28.013
We gather today
for the first public service

01:28.014 --> 01:30.182
of our newly reopened
church.

01:30.183 --> 01:32.968
St. Anne's can finally
once again be the heart

01:32.969 --> 01:36.054
of our community,
where we can congregate

01:36.055 --> 01:37.555
as a people united.

01:37.556 --> 01:42.326
Here, this hour, we come
together to praise God

01:42.327 --> 01:43.770
and give thanks.

01:45.864 --> 01:49.967
The events that took place
at our church were tragic.

01:49.968 --> 01:51.669
Problem?

01:51.670 --> 01:52.904
No.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.406
Then pay attention.

01:54.407 --> 01:56.508
We're meant to seem
like devoted parishioners.

01:56.509 --> 01:59.476
...And it is
that hope in our hearts

01:59.477 --> 02:03.315
and with the help of many
benefactors that allows us

02:03.316 --> 02:05.208
to be here today.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.878
So we gather
with renewed spirit

02:07.879 --> 02:11.923
made stronger, committed
to the ideals of peace

02:11.924 --> 02:14.159
and love. Amen.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.360
Amen.

02:16.361 --> 02:19.229
Each tomb
is well cared for.

02:19.230 --> 02:21.733
Families honor their dead
with displays of affection

02:21.734 --> 02:23.201
and respect...

02:23.202 --> 02:25.035
Is someone there?

02:25.036 --> 02:27.038
This tomb belongs to
the Deveraux family,

02:27.039 --> 02:28.773
known throughout the quarter
for their strong connection

02:28.774 --> 02:30.008
to witchcraft.

02:30.009 --> 02:31.876
Please help me!

02:31.877 --> 02:35.145
And if you look close,
these fresh bricks

02:35.146 --> 02:36.714
tell us someone
in the family

02:36.715 --> 02:37.915
has recently fallen.

02:41.586 --> 02:43.521
Let me out!

02:59.403 --> 03:00.931
Hello, Monique.

03:03.541 --> 03:05.894
Welcome back to
the land of the living.

03:27.131 --> 03:28.875
What is it?
What's going on?

03:31.969 --> 03:33.797
It's a miracle.

03:38.309 --> 03:40.554
Monique?

03:45.516 --> 03:47.102
Ohh!

03:54.825 --> 03:56.660
Lovely sermon
this morning, father.

03:56.661 --> 03:58.295
Quite inspirational.

03:58.296 --> 03:59.830
I wasn't
expecting you to join us.

03:59.831 --> 04:02.232
Oh, we were hoping for some
word from your human sources

04:02.233 --> 04:04.119
on the recent Haitian
invasion.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.969
My guys have their
ears to the ground.

04:05.970 --> 04:08.238
And no one has seen
or heard any sign

04:08.239 --> 04:10.139
of whatever
his name is.

04:10.140 --> 04:11.808
He's called Papa Tunde.

04:11.809 --> 04:12.976
And right now, he's
wandering the corridor

04:12.977 --> 04:14.311
with the power
he absorbed

04:14.312 --> 04:15.846
from every soul I had
buried in the garden.

04:15.847 --> 04:17.079
So you might want
to put your ear

04:17.081 --> 04:18.281
a little closer
to the ground.

04:18.281 --> 04:20.651
Or I could
steer clear

04:20.652 --> 04:22.785
of whatever war
is brewing

04:22.786 --> 04:24.288
between your kind
and his

04:24.289 --> 04:26.023
before I
find myself in...

04:26.024 --> 04:28.024
I wanted to congratulate you
on getting the church

04:28.025 --> 04:29.259
up and running.

04:29.260 --> 04:30.861
I can see this is
a bad time.

04:30.862 --> 04:32.063
Nice to see you, Marcel.

04:33.730 --> 04:35.297
Cami.

04:36.666 --> 04:38.502
Well, don't look at me.

04:38.503 --> 04:40.069
I tried to send her away.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.140
Yes, Diego, what
do you have for me?

04:45.141 --> 04:48.478
Uh, we got
a special delivery.

04:48.479 --> 04:50.499
Would you
care to elaborate?

04:52.048 --> 04:54.718
Either our witch
problems are over

04:54.719 --> 04:57.821
or they're just
getting started.

04:57.822 --> 05:00.390
Marcel.

05:00.391 --> 05:01.593
Father.

05:04.361 --> 05:05.761
God be with you.

05:07.397 --> 05:09.498
Thank you.
God be with you.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.501
Thank you.
God be with y...

05:12.502 --> 05:14.737
Oh, I doubt that, but I
do appreciate the thought.

05:14.738 --> 05:16.038
Bastiana.

05:16.039 --> 05:20.075
Toursion fou,
mort de l'espirit.

05:20.076 --> 05:22.412
Give your nephew Sean
my regards

05:22.413 --> 05:24.746
when you see him in hell.

05:33.723 --> 05:35.669
Can I get you
anything, brother?

05:35.670 --> 05:38.394
A magnifying glass,
a pipe perhaps?

05:38.395 --> 05:39.861
You have a theory
that you'd like

05:39.862 --> 05:41.164
to share with us,
Niklaus?

05:41.165 --> 05:42.665
Back in the day,
the witches wanted

05:42.666 --> 05:43.666
to send a threat, they'd
just kill a chicken

05:43.667 --> 05:45.200
and leave it
on your doorstep.

05:45.201 --> 05:46.803
It's rather a large
and ominous chicken,

05:46.804 --> 05:48.136
wouldn't you say?

05:48.137 --> 05:49.572
Papa Tunde defeated

05:49.573 --> 05:51.439
Rebekah with ease,

05:51.440 --> 05:52.942
almost got the two of us
as well.

05:52.943 --> 05:56.111
If he was supposed to be
their prize fighter,

05:56.112 --> 05:57.780
why leave him for dead
in our front yard?

05:57.781 --> 05:59.248
Well, don't you all
look cheery.

05:59.733 --> 06:01.517
Listen to this...

06:01.518 --> 06:02.752
A girl
literally exploded

06:02.753 --> 06:04.052
from a grave today
as Sabine was giving

06:04.053 --> 06:06.321
her tour of the city
of the dead.

06:06.322 --> 06:08.723
It was Monique Deveraux.

06:08.724 --> 06:10.425
What?

06:10.426 --> 06:11.560
The tourists thought it
was part of the show,

06:11.561 --> 06:12.895
but the witches are
celebrating

06:12.896 --> 06:15.064
like it's some kind of
bloody miracle.

06:15.065 --> 06:16.799
Maybe it is. They
think that all hope is lost,

06:16.800 --> 06:19.135
but now suddenly a harvest
girl is resurrected.

06:19.136 --> 06:21.070
This is how we're gonna
get Davina back...

06:21.071 --> 06:23.138
Kill the witch who took
her place.

06:23.139 --> 06:25.774
I have a theory about
who one of them could be...

06:27.276 --> 06:29.644
Celeste. I mean,
it's got to be.

06:29.645 --> 06:31.380
Davina was trying to tell us.

06:31.381 --> 06:32.934
She was drawing
pictures of Celeste.

06:32.935 --> 06:36.438
She was warning us that
a great evil was coming.

06:38.287 --> 06:41.556
First Papa Tunde
returns to settle old scores.

06:41.557 --> 06:43.892
Now your murdered
lover is back.

06:43.893 --> 06:46.795
This isn't witches
attacking vampires.

06:46.796 --> 06:49.826
They're declaring
war on us.

06:53.998 --> 06:56.972
It's not too early
for scotch, is it,

06:56.973 --> 06:59.208
with all the witches'
shenanigans

06:59.209 --> 07:01.610
and subterfuge afoot.

07:01.611 --> 07:03.679
It is entirely too
early if one intends

07:03.680 --> 07:05.147
to drive, yes.

07:05.148 --> 07:07.682
Funny. I don't have
any plans to go anywhere.

07:07.683 --> 07:10.013
She's not safe here.

07:11.954 --> 07:13.655
You have to take Hayley
to the plantation house

07:13.656 --> 07:15.356
until this is over.

07:15.357 --> 07:16.825
Are you worried about Hayley

07:16.826 --> 07:18.827
or whether or not
you can trust me?

07:18.828 --> 07:21.063
It's precisely
because I trust you

07:21.064 --> 07:23.098
that I'm asking you
to do this.

07:23.099 --> 07:24.633
Here's a novel idea...

07:24.634 --> 07:26.434
Why don't you let Hayley
decide for herself?

07:26.435 --> 07:29.671
Why are you
dictating her fate?

07:29.672 --> 07:31.206
You know why.

07:31.207 --> 07:33.141
Then perhaps you should
take her yourself.

07:33.142 --> 07:35.076
Well, then that would
make me the very

07:35.077 --> 07:37.011
hypocrite that you've
accused me of being.

07:37.012 --> 07:40.482
Rebekah, I cannot
legislate my feelings.

07:40.483 --> 07:43.250
My actions, however...

07:44.486 --> 07:47.922
So would you kindly
do this for me?

07:50.859 --> 07:52.827
You know the mama wolf
loves to be told

07:52.828 --> 07:54.696
what to do.

07:54.697 --> 07:57.699
She's not gonna like it,

07:57.700 --> 07:59.666
but I will do it for you...

08:01.069 --> 08:02.604
If only to end
this silly quarrel

08:02.605 --> 08:04.484
between the two of us.

08:13.081 --> 08:15.116
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

08:15.117 --> 08:16.583
Listen, everybody's
running off, looking

08:16.584 --> 08:18.086
for resurrected witches.

08:18.087 --> 08:20.722
Meanwhile, I think I saw
one at the church...

08:20.723 --> 08:22.123
Genevieve.

08:22.124 --> 08:23.558
What?

08:23.559 --> 08:24.993
I can't be sure.

08:24.994 --> 08:26.294
I only caught her out of
the corner of my eye.

08:26.295 --> 08:27.728
Been with Klaus since.

08:27.729 --> 08:30.031
But it looked like her.

08:30.032 --> 08:32.567
And you and I both know
she would have a reason

08:32.568 --> 08:34.067
to want to be back.

08:34.068 --> 08:36.136
A lot of unfinished
business,

08:36.138 --> 08:39.102
a lot of secrets that you
and I don't want getting out.

08:41.708 --> 08:43.778
I have to take Hayley
to the plantation.

08:43.779 --> 08:47.280
You need to find
Genevieve and end this.

08:47.281 --> 08:49.446
End it like we did
the last time.

08:55.590 --> 08:56.957
Tea, please.

09:09.870 --> 09:11.071
I'm busy.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.540
Cami, just hear me out.

09:12.541 --> 09:14.308
You know, I came to your
reopening because I

09:14.309 --> 09:15.542
wanted to try
and make amends.

09:15.543 --> 09:17.778
And then I see you
talking with Klaus

09:17.779 --> 09:20.313
out in the open, like
it's business as usual

09:20.314 --> 09:21.314
in the quarter.

09:21.315 --> 09:22.916
It is business as usual.

09:22.917 --> 09:24.585
For the past 3 centuries,

09:24.586 --> 09:26.153
the O'Connells have always
tried to keep the peace.

09:26.154 --> 09:27.988
Save me
the family history.

09:27.989 --> 09:30.089
It's all lies
on top of lies.

09:30.090 --> 09:32.780
Cami, p... pour me a drink.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.742
I have to tell you
something.

09:48.837 --> 09:51.145
Uncle Kieran,
what's wrong?

09:51.146 --> 09:53.279
I'm in trouble.

09:53.280 --> 09:57.184
What happened to your
brother Sean is

09:57.185 --> 09:59.152
about to start
happening to me.

09:59.153 --> 10:00.934
What?

10:03.123 --> 10:04.854
Look, uh...

10:07.628 --> 10:10.329
Look, uh,
I've been hexed.

10:11.431 --> 10:14.500
And I don't know
how long I have.

10:14.501 --> 10:16.403
Wait.
I know some people.

10:16.404 --> 10:19.005
There has to be some
sort of... I don't know...

10:19.006 --> 10:20.439
Antidote or...

10:20.440 --> 10:23.844
Cami, I need you
to promise me one thing,

10:23.845 --> 10:26.479
that when it gets bad,

10:26.480 --> 10:29.415
I need you to be as far
away from me as possible.

10:29.416 --> 10:31.218
No. No.

10:31.219 --> 10:33.253
There has to be
some sort of way.

10:33.254 --> 10:35.021
Of course there is.

10:35.022 --> 10:37.456
If you want to save
your Uncle's life,

10:37.457 --> 10:42.261
all you have to do
is take this...

10:42.262 --> 10:45.436
And make sure it ends up
in Klaus Mikaelson's heart.

10:58.142 --> 10:59.643
I thought I was
gonna have to drag you

10:59.644 --> 11:02.013
to the plantation
kicking and screaming.

11:02.014 --> 11:03.548
Yeah. Well, we all just want
to protect me and the baby,

11:03.549 --> 11:04.782
right?

11:04.783 --> 11:06.550
Hey. I'm on your side,
remember?

11:06.551 --> 11:08.501
So what gives?

11:09.854 --> 11:11.889
Tonight's a full moon,
Rebekah.

11:11.890 --> 11:14.058
So what? You're preggers.
You can't turn.

11:14.059 --> 11:16.227
Yes. But I wanted
to invite

11:16.228 --> 11:17.794
a few people over.

11:17.795 --> 11:19.396
Of course.

11:19.397 --> 11:21.265
Every red-blooded
American werewolf

11:21.266 --> 11:23.267
will be a bundle of fur
and sharp teeth tonight

11:23.268 --> 11:25.235
whilst your cursed
crescent clan will be...

11:25.236 --> 11:27.705
Human but only for
a few hours

11:27.706 --> 11:29.273
and won't be again until
the next full moon.

11:29.274 --> 11:33.311
So I asked Josh to get
a message out to Eve

11:33.312 --> 11:34.745
in the bayou.

11:34.746 --> 11:37.447
Josh isn't dead yet?
Well, good on him.

11:37.448 --> 11:40.116
I love a nice
survival story.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.085
Who the bloody hell is that?

11:42.086 --> 11:45.371
Kegs out back,
right? Ahem.

11:47.324 --> 11:48.826
Right.

11:48.827 --> 11:50.194
It appears you weren't
going to wait for me

11:50.195 --> 11:52.029
to grant you permission
to throw a kegger.

11:52.030 --> 11:54.431
Listen, you all want me
safe, fine.

11:54.432 --> 11:55.933
I'll do as I'm told.

11:55.934 --> 11:58.502
I'll play damsel
in the glass tower.

11:58.503 --> 12:00.471
But tonight's
the one night a month

12:00.472 --> 12:02.206
that I can meet
my family.

12:02.207 --> 12:05.058
Now, you could rat me
out, send me to my room,

12:05.059 --> 12:08.345
or you
could help me throw

12:08.346 --> 12:10.113
one hell of a party.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.489
Elijah.

12:19.490 --> 12:22.458
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

12:22.459 --> 12:24.528
My family needs
an ally

12:24.529 --> 12:26.163
among the witches,
and you've helped us

12:26.164 --> 12:27.764
in the past.

12:27.765 --> 12:29.266
Perhaps together we
can avoid

12:29.267 --> 12:30.541
an unnecessary
conflict.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.936
They may be willing
to make a deal

12:33.937 --> 12:35.972
if it were with
the noble Elijah.

12:35.973 --> 12:38.375
But there will never be
any peace as long as it

12:38.376 --> 12:39.575
involves Klaus.

12:39.576 --> 12:40.811
Is that what all this
is about?

12:40.812 --> 12:42.345
You want my brother
out of town?

12:42.346 --> 12:44.214
I'm just telling you
how they feel.

12:44.215 --> 12:46.216
My people are scared.
They're desperate,

12:46.217 --> 12:48.518
but they're not dumb.

12:48.519 --> 12:50.352
You have a niece
on the way.

12:51.722 --> 12:53.523
It stands to reason you'd
be willing to discuss

12:53.524 --> 12:55.066
how to run him out
of the city.

12:56.593 --> 12:58.360
Let's walk together.

12:59.963 --> 13:02.998
You can take me
on one of your famous tours.

13:06.670 --> 13:08.205
You should eat

13:08.206 --> 13:10.639
after everything you've
been through.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.709
I was dead.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.979
But you're here now.

13:16.980 --> 13:21.383
Aunt Sophie, what
happened to mom?

13:26.189 --> 13:29.958
Your mother loved you
so much.

13:29.959 --> 13:32.829
She had faith that she
could use magic

13:32.830 --> 13:34.596
to complete the harvest

13:34.597 --> 13:37.567
and get you back.

13:37.568 --> 13:42.605
In the end, she sacrificed
herself for the cause,

13:42.606 --> 13:46.367
for the witches, for you.

13:48.011 --> 13:50.329
And do you have
her faith?

13:51.648 --> 13:53.582
I lost my faith.

13:55.852 --> 14:00.088
Then I realized
that if I didn't believe,

14:00.089 --> 14:01.790
I would be letting
you down.

14:04.227 --> 14:07.929
I tried to get it back.
I tried.

14:10.867 --> 14:12.434
Monique Deveraux.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.871
Everyone in the
quarter's been talking

14:14.872 --> 14:16.071
about you.

14:16.072 --> 14:19.642
Classy.
You kill her mother

14:19.643 --> 14:21.477
and now you've come
to threaten her?

14:21.478 --> 14:23.812
I'm not here
to threaten anyone.

14:25.214 --> 14:27.717
What do you want, Marcel?

14:27.718 --> 14:28.951
There were 3 more
girls sacrificed

14:28.952 --> 14:30.353
during the harvest.

14:30.354 --> 14:31.587
I want to bring
them back.

14:31.588 --> 14:33.621
Who are you kidding?

14:33.622 --> 14:35.724
You don't care
about those girls.

14:35.725 --> 14:38.460
You just want Davina back so
you can use her power again.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.161
I just
want her alive.

14:40.162 --> 14:41.923
He's telling the truth.

14:43.899 --> 14:45.100
How do you know that?

14:45.101 --> 14:47.570
I can feel it.

14:47.571 --> 14:49.737
He's loyal to her.

14:50.739 --> 14:52.391
He's here to help.

15:02.918 --> 15:04.552
I got your message.

15:04.553 --> 15:05.620
Where's Kieran now?

15:05.621 --> 15:09.090
In the attic resting,
praying.

15:10.759 --> 15:14.362
He's gonna go crazy
and die, isn't he...

15:14.363 --> 15:16.364
Just like Sean.

15:16.365 --> 15:19.301
And we'll still be
in this stupid fight

15:19.302 --> 15:21.703
because he lied to
me about the witches

15:21.704 --> 15:24.606
and vampires...

15:24.607 --> 15:26.307
And you.

15:28.377 --> 15:29.777
Camille...

15:33.882 --> 15:36.318
I can see why you hate me.

15:36.319 --> 15:40.989
Truth be told, I have done
some dreadful things.

15:40.990 --> 15:44.326
But the lies your Uncle
told were meant

15:44.327 --> 15:45.694
to protect you.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.695
He is a good man...

15:48.730 --> 15:50.491
With a loyal heart.

15:52.033 --> 15:53.953
And he is your family.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.707
As for these witches,

15:58.708 --> 16:00.775
their attack on Kieran
should be proof enough

16:00.776 --> 16:02.577
they're the enemy.

16:02.578 --> 16:05.746
In that we are united.

16:11.052 --> 16:12.686
Klaus...

16:24.899 --> 16:28.670
This is
Papa Tunde's blade.

16:28.671 --> 16:30.371
A witch gave it
to me.

16:30.372 --> 16:32.373
Said it would
cause untold pain

16:32.374 --> 16:34.285
and torment,
even to an original.

16:35.810 --> 16:37.145
She said if I stuck
it in your heart,

16:37.146 --> 16:39.624
she would heal
Kieran.

16:39.625 --> 16:43.818
And yet you chose
to reject their offer.

16:43.819 --> 16:46.988
Maybe if I were more
like you, I could do it.

16:46.989 --> 16:48.722
But I'm not...

16:48.723 --> 16:50.657
A monster.

16:50.658 --> 16:52.460
I'm not stupid.

16:52.461 --> 16:54.362
If there's a war
going on,

16:54.363 --> 16:56.229
I want to be on
the winning side.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.805
Let's see what we can do
about saving your Uncle,

17:03.806 --> 17:05.204
shall we?

17:37.345 --> 17:38.474
Hello again.

17:43.919 --> 17:46.565
I'm looking forward
to meeting you soon.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.540
You've got to be
kidding me.

18:06.541 --> 18:08.576
A vampire is
trying to reverse

18:08.577 --> 18:11.479
a witch's hex
placed on you,

18:11.480 --> 18:14.282
and it's the cup you
find sacrilegious.

18:26.094 --> 18:27.762
Are you sure this is
going to work?

18:27.763 --> 18:29.463
Not remotely.

18:29.464 --> 18:31.099
But I can't attempt
to use my compulsion

18:31.100 --> 18:33.401
to counter Bastiana's
curse if the good father

18:33.402 --> 18:35.837
has vervain in his
system. Thus...

18:35.838 --> 18:38.772
We bleed him out.

18:38.773 --> 18:40.908
I never said this
would be pleasant.

18:40.909 --> 18:43.122
Just do what you have to do.

19:02.129 --> 19:04.398
So help me God, Marcel,
if you don't call me

19:04.399 --> 19:06.687
back with an update,
I will kill you myself.

19:13.641 --> 19:15.710
Oh.

19:15.711 --> 19:17.444
I beg...

19:17.445 --> 19:19.158
Your pardon.

19:21.782 --> 19:25.152
I was expecting
someone furrier.

19:25.153 --> 19:28.022
You're one of them,
aren't you?

19:28.023 --> 19:29.756
An original.

19:29.757 --> 19:33.626
Yes. You might want to say
that with some more respect.

19:35.863 --> 19:38.098
I suppose you'll be
wanting Hayley.

19:38.099 --> 19:39.899
Or I could just
talk to you.

19:42.069 --> 19:43.704
I'm Oliver.

19:43.705 --> 19:45.935
I didn't catch
your name.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.409
I'm Rebekah.

19:51.078 --> 19:53.346
Hayley, the party's here!

19:58.285 --> 20:01.120
You got enough power left
to find these witches?

20:01.121 --> 20:03.222
I know the harvest
was an epic fail,

20:03.223 --> 20:04.691
but I can still do
a locator spell.

20:04.692 --> 20:06.994
Before I do that,

20:06.995 --> 20:08.428
we need to make
a deal.

20:08.429 --> 20:09.897
What deal?

20:09.898 --> 20:11.064
If I betray these
witches, they're

20:11.065 --> 20:12.466
gonna come looking
for me.

20:12.467 --> 20:14.868
And if I'm caught,
I'm dead.

20:14.869 --> 20:16.068
I said I'd protect you.

20:16.069 --> 20:17.604
If you
could do that,

20:17.605 --> 20:18.805
you wouldn't need my
help in the first place.

20:18.806 --> 20:20.040
The quarter isn't safe.

20:20.041 --> 20:21.441
Vampires on one side,

20:21.442 --> 20:23.143
witches on the other.

20:23.144 --> 20:25.712
No way am I
letting Monique get

20:25.713 --> 20:27.114
in the middle of that.

20:27.115 --> 20:29.416
In order to get her out,

20:29.417 --> 20:31.051
I'm gonna need money.

20:31.052 --> 20:33.086
Do we have a deal?

20:34.756 --> 20:37.090
Find the witches,
I'll give you anything

20:37.091 --> 20:38.529
you could ever need.

20:59.579 --> 21:01.613
Well, come on! You can
do better than that.

21:01.614 --> 21:04.551
Sorry. I've got
a burdened brain tonight.

21:04.552 --> 21:06.086
No, no, no, no.

21:06.087 --> 21:07.487
Tonight is not
a night for burdens.

21:07.488 --> 21:10.557
It's to celebrate.

21:10.558 --> 21:12.592
It's to enjoy life for
the few hours that we get

21:12.593 --> 21:14.194
to live it.

21:14.195 --> 21:17.230
It's to hug our friends,
our family,

21:17.231 --> 21:20.112
and to dance our asses off.

21:45.224 --> 21:46.759
I seriously doubt
you invited us here

21:46.760 --> 21:48.527
to wait on us.

21:52.365 --> 21:56.501
You're Hayley.
I'm Jackson.

21:58.037 --> 21:59.739
It's nice to see
you again.

21:59.740 --> 22:03.976
You're the wolf who's
been watching me.

22:03.977 --> 22:05.978
I got to keep
my eye on you,

22:05.979 --> 22:08.213
precious cargo
and all.

22:08.214 --> 22:09.749
Right.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.851
Got to protect
the miracle baby.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.953
No. That's not
what I meant.

22:13.954 --> 22:15.620
I don't care
about the baby.

22:17.022 --> 22:18.691
Sorry.
That came out wrong.

22:18.692 --> 22:20.893
I mean, of course
I care.

22:20.894 --> 22:22.228
You're a labonair.

22:22.229 --> 22:25.163
A baby,
it's a big deal.

22:25.164 --> 22:29.168
But personally, my
interest is in you.

22:29.169 --> 22:31.803
You don't even know me.

22:31.804 --> 22:34.807
Our parents knew
each other.

22:34.808 --> 22:36.475
They were of
the same people

22:36.476 --> 22:38.010
but not the same
bloodline.

22:38.011 --> 22:40.211
Now, you know how pack
hierarchy works, right?

22:40.212 --> 22:41.714
Everybody has their
part to play,

22:41.715 --> 22:45.718
and we had
our part, too.

22:45.719 --> 22:48.219
What part was that?

22:50.622 --> 22:52.454
You were supposed to
be my wife.

22:59.531 --> 23:01.200
So this next
part of town is

23:01.201 --> 23:02.734
one of the few areas

23:02.735 --> 23:04.236
where any of
the original French

23:04.237 --> 23:05.537
architecture remains.

23:05.538 --> 23:07.806
Most of the buildings
were destroyed

23:07.807 --> 23:09.041
in the 1700s,
when the city burned

23:09.042 --> 23:10.841
for the first time.

23:13.345 --> 23:15.880
Am I putting you
to sleep?

23:15.881 --> 23:17.482
As surprising
as you might find this,

23:17.483 --> 23:19.184
it's not every day
that someone asks you

23:19.185 --> 23:21.787
to betray your own brother...

23:21.788 --> 23:23.527
Celeste.

23:26.258 --> 23:28.759
How did you know?

23:28.760 --> 23:32.286
As Davina was drawing
your likeness...

23:32.287 --> 23:34.699
I dared to imagine
that your presence

23:34.700 --> 23:35.867
was near.

23:35.868 --> 23:37.169
And when Sophie
discovered

23:37.170 --> 23:38.937
that there was no magic
in your remains,

23:38.938 --> 23:41.506
I wondered...

23:41.507 --> 23:44.709
Could you have possibly
cheated death by using

23:44.710 --> 23:46.210
your power to place
your essence

23:46.211 --> 23:47.812
into the body
of another?

23:47.813 --> 23:50.512
And if so, then who?

23:52.384 --> 23:56.921
And then I recalled
the lovely Sabine.

23:56.922 --> 23:59.124
Are you gonna continue
following me, Elijah?

23:59.125 --> 24:00.791
Or do you want to talk?

24:00.792 --> 24:02.527
You know who I am.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.828
Original vampire,
always wears a suit?

24:04.829 --> 24:06.797
Your visions of my
brother's child

24:06.798 --> 24:09.134
precipitated the death
of the last elder

24:09.135 --> 24:10.468
within your coven...

24:10.469 --> 24:12.003
Tell them what you saw.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.377
Ensuring that
the harvest ritual

24:19.378 --> 24:20.944
could not
be completed...

24:20.945 --> 24:23.013
Unless you
were to control it.

24:25.516 --> 24:28.118
You're playing a very
long game indeed...

24:32.657 --> 24:34.431
To what end?

24:49.040 --> 24:51.542
Oh, Elijah...

24:51.543 --> 24:55.445
My lost love...

24:57.848 --> 25:00.207
After
all this time...

25:02.253 --> 25:05.355
Don't you understand?

25:06.390 --> 25:09.259
I died because of Klaus.

25:09.260 --> 25:12.162
And even after all his
vindictive lies

25:12.163 --> 25:14.165
about witches led to my
death, you stood by him

25:14.166 --> 25:17.300
all because of your vow,
"always and forever."

25:17.301 --> 25:18.701
What have you done to me?

25:18.702 --> 25:20.538
It's a simple
enchantment.

25:20.539 --> 25:21.972
You needn't worry.

25:21.973 --> 25:24.175
I'm not here
to kill you, Elijah.

25:24.176 --> 25:25.142
I'm here
to teach you

25:25.143 --> 25:26.977
the error of your
ways.

25:26.978 --> 25:28.512
"Always and forever" was

25:28.513 --> 25:30.112
the greatest mistake
of your life.

25:42.177 --> 25:46.044
Drink up.
It will heal your wound.

25:52.854 --> 25:55.762
I think you've
suffered enough.

26:00.795 --> 26:02.603
You will overcome

26:02.604 --> 26:04.532
what the witches
did to you.

26:04.533 --> 26:07.399
You will resist the dark
urges of their hex.

26:15.476 --> 26:16.644
Did it work?

26:16.645 --> 26:19.347
Ohh. How do I know
if it worked?

26:19.348 --> 26:22.183
All I know is
that the vervain is out

26:22.184 --> 26:24.185
and I'm at the mercy of
this murderous bastard.

26:24.186 --> 26:26.420
I bet you find that
really funny, don't you,

26:26.421 --> 26:28.389
Cami, you little...

26:28.390 --> 26:30.424
I'm... I'm sorry.

26:30.425 --> 26:32.060
I don't know
why I said that.

26:32.061 --> 26:34.195
Well, I guess
that's our answer.

26:34.196 --> 26:36.197
Wait. Klaus,
where are you going?

26:36.198 --> 26:37.865
What are we going
to do?

26:37.866 --> 26:40.034
I'm going to find
the witch who did this.

26:40.035 --> 26:42.269
And then I'm going to
do what I do best.

26:49.410 --> 26:51.077
I'm weaker than
I thought.

26:51.078 --> 26:53.654
You want the deal, Soph,
you got to hold up your end.

26:54.615 --> 26:56.156
I'm on a clock.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.520
Ok.

27:01.555 --> 27:03.790
It's working.

27:05.793 --> 27:08.228
That's one. I need all 3.

27:08.229 --> 27:09.896
I'm giving you
whatever I can pick up.

27:09.897 --> 27:11.132
Keep trying.

27:11.133 --> 27:13.401
Or don't.

27:13.402 --> 27:15.369
Who needs a locator spell
when I have all the leverage

27:15.370 --> 27:18.606
I need right here?

27:18.607 --> 27:20.097
No! Monique!

27:22.943 --> 27:24.778
You've poisoned me
with a kiss.

27:24.779 --> 27:28.855
Uh! At least you haven't
lost your sense of irony.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.118
We may have time
for more.

27:31.119 --> 27:32.753
But first, I'm going
to cure you

27:32.754 --> 27:36.624
of your greatest flaw...
This absurd devotion

27:36.625 --> 27:38.292
to your lunatic family.

27:38.293 --> 27:41.095
Celeste, your anger
is with me.

27:41.096 --> 27:42.662
Now, if you have come
here seeking revenge...

27:42.663 --> 27:44.765
Oh, I'll have
my revenge,

27:44.766 --> 27:45.933
starting with Klaus.

27:45.934 --> 27:48.468
He is gonna know
pain and torment

27:48.469 --> 27:49.869
like he's never
felt before...

27:49.870 --> 27:51.138
Unless you choose
to save him,

27:51.139 --> 27:52.806
of course.

27:52.807 --> 27:54.740
But then that leaves
Rebekah,

27:54.741 --> 27:56.677
your tragic sister.

27:56.678 --> 27:58.045
She's about to find
herself

27:58.046 --> 27:59.513
in quite
the predicament.

27:59.514 --> 28:02.481
You could save her.

28:03.723 --> 28:06.119
But then that leaves
Hayley in jeopardy.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.688
No. No, no...

28:07.689 --> 28:10.657
Ah, this poor girl.

28:10.658 --> 28:13.126
She has no idea
how dangerous it is

28:13.127 --> 28:14.527
to be loved by you.

28:17.264 --> 28:19.099
Oh, well.

28:19.100 --> 28:20.700
With your body weakened
by my spell,

28:20.701 --> 28:22.469
you won't be
able to save them all.

28:22.470 --> 28:25.505
You'll recover
with just enough time

28:25.506 --> 28:27.581
to choose one.

28:29.376 --> 28:30.876
Who will it be?

28:32.345 --> 28:34.013
I can't wait
to find out.

28:43.846 --> 28:47.127
Witches of
the French quarter,

28:47.128 --> 28:51.463
I have with me
Monique Deveraux.

28:51.464 --> 28:54.968
What a shame it would be
were I forced to send her

28:54.969 --> 28:57.704
back to the death
she's just escaped.

28:57.705 --> 29:01.474
Should you wish
to prevent this...

29:02.031 --> 29:04.377
Bring me
the witch Bastiana.

29:04.378 --> 29:06.012
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

29:06.013 --> 29:08.780
I'm opening negotiations.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.782
You know my rules.
We do not hurt kids.

29:10.783 --> 29:12.951
Spare me the hypocrisy
of your moral code.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.128
It didn't stop you from
killing Monique's mother.

29:16.623 --> 29:21.059
Bastiana!
I know you're close.

29:21.060 --> 29:24.530
The stench of witches
hangs in the air.

29:24.531 --> 29:27.200
Mark my words.

29:27.201 --> 29:28.734
I will end this girl

29:28.735 --> 29:30.702
with the very blade
you meant for me.

29:30.703 --> 29:32.905
I'm not saying it
again.

29:32.906 --> 29:35.507
We do not kill kids.

29:50.056 --> 29:52.916
I decide who lives
and dies here, Marcellus.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.897
Aah!

30:27.493 --> 30:30.061
I'll take it from here.

30:43.126 --> 30:45.260
I know it's a lot
to take in.

30:45.261 --> 30:47.263
You think?

30:47.264 --> 30:49.431
I just wanted
to meet my family.

30:49.432 --> 30:51.734
I never imagined
I'd meet my husband

30:51.735 --> 30:54.269
from some weird-ass
arranged marriage.

30:54.270 --> 30:56.238
I guess you don't know
about any of this

30:56.239 --> 30:59.541
because there was never
anyone around to teach you.

31:01.310 --> 31:05.080
The crescents aren't just
any pack of wolves.

31:05.081 --> 31:08.484
Ok? The bloodline goes
back to the very beginning...

31:08.485 --> 31:12.387
two families...
Yours and mine.

31:14.056 --> 31:15.691
I guess that makes us
kind of like royalty.

31:16.892 --> 31:18.359
This is a joke,

31:18.360 --> 31:20.896
right? I mean,

31:20.897 --> 31:22.547
if you're royalty,
where's the throne?

31:27.102 --> 31:30.680
New Orleans used
to be our town.

31:30.681 --> 31:34.342
And we lost it all because
of some infighting.

31:34.343 --> 31:36.111
The vampires came after us.

31:36.112 --> 31:37.746
And if our
families were united,

31:37.747 --> 31:39.022
we could have taken them.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.584
So our parents
decided to bring

31:42.585 --> 31:44.286
the two lines back together.

31:44.287 --> 31:47.388
And you and I
were betrothed.

31:48.557 --> 31:49.725
I'm sorry.

31:49.726 --> 31:52.326
This is ridiculous.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.029
Look, obviously things
didn't work out

31:54.030 --> 31:55.497
the way anyone thought
they would.

31:55.498 --> 31:57.732
Our pack made a huge
misstep with the vampires

31:57.733 --> 31:59.233
when we refused
to back down.

31:59.234 --> 32:02.704
And Marcel had us cursed
by a witch.

32:02.705 --> 32:06.091
You are the last one of
your bloodline, Andrea.

32:07.743 --> 32:11.221
Or, Hayley, whatever
you call yourself.

32:12.914 --> 32:15.883
These people
will follow you.

32:15.884 --> 32:19.153
You can help them... you
and what you represent.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.355
And what is that
exactly?

32:21.356 --> 32:23.959
A time when
things were different,

32:23.960 --> 32:26.393
when our people fought back.

32:26.394 --> 32:32.394
And after everything you
went through to find us...

32:32.395 --> 32:34.536
You're the one who's
gonna break our curse.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.373
What are you talking
about?

32:39.607 --> 32:41.041
Your witch friend.

32:41.042 --> 32:43.545
She told Eve she was
coming here tonight

32:43.546 --> 32:44.879
to set us free.

32:44.880 --> 32:48.216
Wait. What witch friend?

32:59.327 --> 33:00.979
I'm sorry.

33:00.980 --> 33:04.566
I really do like you, but
this is the deal we made.

33:04.567 --> 33:06.968
What deal?

33:06.969 --> 33:08.528
With whom?

33:58.185 --> 33:59.687
Hayley.

33:59.688 --> 34:02.289
Elijah, something's going
on with the witches.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.058
Listen to me. You were right.

34:04.059 --> 34:06.459
Celeste is back.

34:06.460 --> 34:09.672
Niklaus, Rebekah.
You're all in danger.

34:11.899 --> 34:13.601
What's going on?

34:13.601 --> 34:14.867
It's a trap. I didn't
make a deal with any witch.

34:14.868 --> 34:16.270
What?

34:16.271 --> 34:17.538
Hayley, you
have to find Rebekah.

34:17.539 --> 34:19.371
And you stay with her
until I get there.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.077
Elijah, it's a spell.

34:23.078 --> 34:24.510
They're trapping us inside.

34:45.899 --> 34:47.699
You know what to do.

34:54.541 --> 34:56.344
We have to get
out of here.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.192
Here. Breathe
through this.

35:30.945 --> 35:32.145
Where's Rebekah?

35:32.146 --> 35:34.213
I don't know.

35:35.882 --> 35:37.116
She went off
with one of them.

35:37.117 --> 35:40.420
Elijah, my friend is
still in there.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.410
On your feet.

36:12.618 --> 36:13.853
Help me.

36:13.854 --> 36:16.382
It's been such a long
time, Rebekah.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.193
I'm going to enjoy this.

36:38.095 --> 36:39.781
Missing something?

36:42.433 --> 36:43.633
You won't hurt me.

36:43.634 --> 36:45.402
I'm the only one alive
who can break

36:45.403 --> 36:46.970
the curse on Hayley's
family.

36:46.971 --> 36:49.457
And Genevieve knows
where your sister is.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.643
Bastiana has Klaus
tucked away

36:52.644 --> 36:54.611
someplace safe.

36:54.612 --> 36:56.880
He's suffering horribly,
I might add,

36:56.881 --> 36:58.548
and all because you
chose to save

36:58.549 --> 37:01.918
the little wolf instead
of your own blood.

37:04.389 --> 37:07.183
What a horrific
ending...

37:09.927 --> 37:14.298
To your pathetic,
diseased family.

37:21.204 --> 37:24.507
I guess "always" isn't
forever after all.

37:28.713 --> 37:31.715
I have to go. The moon.

37:31.716 --> 37:32.949
Listen, Jackson,

37:32.950 --> 37:35.485
I want to thank you
for protecting me,

37:35.486 --> 37:36.987
not just tonight.

37:36.988 --> 37:38.622
I've been dreaming to thank you
about meeting you,

37:38.623 --> 37:40.008
since I was a kid.

37:41.958 --> 37:44.126
I never thought
it would go like this.

37:45.629 --> 37:47.557
Hey...

37:48.832 --> 37:50.834
I won't stop
until I find a way

37:50.835 --> 37:51.936
to break this curse.

37:53.703 --> 37:55.607
I promise.

38:02.378 --> 38:04.313
Come on. Come on. Come on.

38:05.982 --> 38:08.151
Klaus, where are you?

38:08.152 --> 38:11.753
Mr. Mikaelson
is currently indisposed.

38:13.523 --> 38:15.592
What happened?
What did you do?

38:15.593 --> 38:17.327
I did nothing.

38:17.328 --> 38:20.028
Someone completed
your task for you.

38:20.029 --> 38:21.931
If you got what you
wanted, then my Uncle...

38:21.932 --> 38:23.165
Will die soon

38:23.166 --> 38:24.967
and in great anguish.

38:24.968 --> 38:27.270
You see, dear, you failed
to hold up your end

38:27.271 --> 38:28.805
of our bargain.

38:28.806 --> 38:32.075
You chose instead to side
with evil as your Uncle

38:32.076 --> 38:34.062
has done many times
before you.

38:35.545 --> 38:37.080
But take heart.

38:37.081 --> 38:39.015
His punishment will atone
for his attempts

38:39.016 --> 38:40.482
to prevent the harvest.

38:40.483 --> 38:42.952
His suffering
will purify him.

38:42.953 --> 38:44.853
You'd do well to heed
his lesson, girl.

38:44.854 --> 38:48.558
To oppose us is to oppose
the natural order.

38:48.559 --> 38:51.327
By choice or by force,

38:51.328 --> 38:53.429
the witches
of the French quarter

38:53.430 --> 38:55.297
will rise again.

39:01.537 --> 39:03.305
We looked everywhere
for him.

39:03.306 --> 39:05.641
Tore apart the cauldron,
the city of the dead.

39:05.642 --> 39:07.709
Wherever they got him,
he ain't in the quarter.

39:07.710 --> 39:09.878
Marcel!

39:09.879 --> 39:12.347
Where is my brother?

39:12.348 --> 39:14.382
I got guys out
looking for him right now.

39:19.788 --> 39:21.156
Elijah!

39:23.592 --> 39:25.828
Klaus threw one of his
classic temper tantrums,

39:25.829 --> 39:27.196
snapped my neck,

39:27.197 --> 39:28.831
tried to take on a coven
of witches by himself.

39:28.832 --> 39:30.266
He got dropped.

39:30.267 --> 39:32.501
I don't know where he is
or how to find him.

39:32.502 --> 39:35.456
They also have Rebekah.

39:38.807 --> 39:43.445
Every one of you
will help me

39:43.446 --> 39:45.633
to find them.

39:46.915 --> 39:48.816
I'm going to kill
them all.

39:54.923 --> 39:56.625
Come on. We have to go.

39:56.626 --> 39:58.646
I don't want to go.

39:59.862 --> 40:02.064
Monique, this isn't
a debate.

40:02.065 --> 40:04.333
I just stabbed
an original.

40:04.334 --> 40:05.601
He's gonna kill me

40:05.602 --> 40:07.322
as soon as he's
recovered.

40:08.103 --> 40:10.806
Look...

40:10.807 --> 40:12.973
I'm sorry
for everything.

40:12.974 --> 40:15.142
I should have
come and got you

40:15.143 --> 40:16.777
before that stupid
harvest.

40:16.778 --> 40:20.614
But you can still
have a normal life,

40:20.615 --> 40:25.786
one without all this
crazy witch nonsense.

40:28.490 --> 40:31.493
But I am a witch.

40:31.494 --> 40:34.995
And I don't want to go.

40:38.301 --> 40:41.503
Monique?

40:41.504 --> 40:44.272
The ancestors said you
didn't have enough faith.

40:44.273 --> 40:47.541
I was
hoping they were wrong.

40:47.542 --> 40:49.911
I should
have known better.

40:54.883 --> 40:55.983
Monique...

40:55.984 --> 40:58.285
You tried to stop
the harvest.

40:58.286 --> 40:59.653
Please don't do this.

40:59.654 --> 41:00.722
Now you want to run

41:00.723 --> 41:02.423
when we need to stay
and fight.

41:02.424 --> 41:04.491
Please. I'm begging
you, don't... don't...

41:04.492 --> 41:06.027
The four of us,
when we return,

41:06.028 --> 41:07.529
we'll have enough power
