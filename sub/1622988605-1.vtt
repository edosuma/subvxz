WEBVTT

04:26.792 --> 04:27.626
Yes.

04:28.292 --> 04:29.709
How are you?

04:30.209 --> 04:32.167
- Good.
- It's been a while.

04:32.292 --> 04:34.959
Your grandmother? Better?

04:35.667 --> 04:37.167
Worse.

04:37.251 --> 04:39.251
She is lucky to have you.

04:39.417 --> 04:43.001
Your father would have been proud
that you are taking care other.

04:43.084 --> 04:44.709
Look…

04:45.376 --> 04:48.584
I wanted to ask you,
what time will you be home tomorrow?

04:48.876 --> 04:50.834
In the afternoon, after work. Why?

04:50.959 --> 04:52.876
I have sent you something small.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.751
It's different from the others.

04:54.834 --> 04:56.834
We'll talk tomorrow. Good night.

04:56.959 --> 04:58.959
Good night.

05:45.084 --> 05:48.501
100, 200, 300, 400, 20…

05:53.667 --> 05:56.084
And two euros.

05:56.334 --> 05:57.459
This is the last of it.

05:57.626 --> 06:00.042
I'll get in touch with you
if I need you again.

07:24.251 --> 07:26.459
I didn't want to send
a German language book this time

07:26.542 --> 07:28.626
but something to get familiar
with the area here.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.834
I've written our address
on the first page.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.917
She left us this morning.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.626
Will you come?

07:40.709 --> 07:42.751
I would have come for sure…

07:42.834 --> 07:45.626
But I am alone with Patrick these days.
It's difficult for me to leave.

07:45.709 --> 07:48.959
I can't leave him with Helga.
I don't trust her.

07:49.042 --> 07:52.292
It's also his birthday this Sunday
and I have to organise a party.

07:52.834 --> 07:54.834
I wish I could be there.

08:13.792 --> 08:15.709
We offer a very economical package.

08:15.834 --> 08:18.209
1050 euros for the entire ceremony.

08:18.292 --> 08:20.709
We provide the hearse

08:20.834 --> 08:24.251
and two people to transport the coffin.

08:24.417 --> 08:26.251
We need two more.

08:26.334 --> 08:28.376
One more person besides you.

08:28.501 --> 08:32.001
The price doesn't include
the workers who dig the grave.

08:32.584 --> 08:36.251
With the digging of the grave,
the price will be 1200 euros.

08:37.376 --> 08:40.709
Shall I presume that
a family grave already exists?

08:41.667 --> 08:45.501
Then we have coffee, rusk and brandy.
Two euros per person.

08:45.792 --> 08:49.459
If we expect around fifty people,

08:50.042 --> 08:52.792
then the price will be at 1500 euros.

08:52.917 --> 08:56.001
Unless the deceased was popular.

08:58.126 --> 09:00.417
Was she popular?

10:19.709 --> 10:24.167
CASH FOR GOLD

10:29.167 --> 10:32.334
PAWN SHOP

11:59.292 --> 12:01.334
Lesson one.

12:01.417 --> 12:03.501
I live in Munich.

12:03.751 --> 12:05.751
Bavaria is wonderful.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.501
Lesson one.

12:07.584 --> 12:09.709
I live in Munich.

13:27.126 --> 13:30.334
Excuse me! You cannot sleep here.

20:28.292 --> 20:31.126
My name is Ursula,
Ursula Handtmann.

20:31.709 --> 20:34.376
I'm twenty-six years old.

20:34.667 --> 20:39.667
Hello, my name is Ursula,
Ursula Handtmann.

20:41.501 --> 20:44.167
I'm twenty-six years old.

20:44.626 --> 20:47.917
I live in Munich. Bavaria is…

20:53.834 --> 20:58.501
Are you hungry?

21:01.251 --> 21:03.376
You have money?

21:47.084 --> 21:48.876
You're a fast-food kid.

22:01.459 --> 22:03.501
Number 12 for me.

22:05.042 --> 22:09.167
And 54 for my friend.

22:11.501 --> 22:12.501
Thank you.

22:20.209 --> 22:21.084
Sorry.

22:21.501 --> 22:24.334
And a saucer with pickles, please.

22:24.459 --> 22:25.792
Of course.

33:39.334 --> 33:41.042
Fuck you, asshole!

33:41.292 --> 33:43.501
Stronzo in your face, asshole.

34:35.792 --> 34:37.876
- Hello.
- Hello.

34:37.959 --> 34:41.126
You know you were driving
over the limit?

34:42.792 --> 34:45.001
Licence and registration, please.

34:51.417 --> 34:52.417
Calm down.

34:57.251 --> 34:59.001
Who is Angeliki?

34:59.459 --> 35:00.334
Who?

35:04.792 --> 35:06.917
It's none of your business.

35:07.001 --> 35:08.792
Have you been drinking?

35:08.917 --> 35:09.751
Yes.

35:10.917 --> 35:12.667
Are you going to take our order, then?

35:12.792 --> 35:15.084
Get out of the car.

35:15.292 --> 35:17.667
Get out! Exit the car.

35:18.001 --> 35:19.626
Let's go.

35:22.667 --> 35:23.626
Come on.

38:25.626 --> 38:27.459
Tommaso, hi.

38:27.667 --> 38:28.751
Mathias.

38:30.667 --> 38:32.501
Hi. You came!

38:33.167 --> 38:34.917
I brought a friend, OK?

38:35.584 --> 38:38.917
Tommaso this is Victoras.
Victoras, this is Tommaso.

38:40.542 --> 38:42.626
Strong handshake.

38:42.792 --> 38:44.334
Are you German?

38:45.751 --> 38:46.917
English?

38:47.751 --> 38:49.167
French?

38:49.626 --> 38:50.959
Bulgarian?

38:51.334 --> 38:53.167
Ask him if he's Greek.

38:53.334 --> 38:54.709
Greek?

38:55.167 --> 38:56.001
Yes.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.042
But of course!

42:55.001 --> 42:57.542
Here I am. Turn right.

43:12.251 --> 43:13.417
Bye, beautiful.

43:17.876 --> 43:19.667
Thanks a lot.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.792
You've forgotten something!

51:37.626 --> 51:39.792
Are you tired?

1:01:28.584 --> 1:01:29.834
Hello.

1:01:32.834 --> 1:01:34.667
Have you…

1:05:02.334 --> 1:05:04.459
No. No. No…

1:05:04.667 --> 1:05:07.834
Come in, come in.

1:06:06.626 --> 1:06:09.667
I'm sorry. That's my son.

1:06:11.126 --> 1:06:14.126
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

1:06:16.542 --> 1:06:17.917
You are here!

1:06:18.584 --> 1:06:20.126
I came with a friend.

1:06:20.834 --> 1:06:23.376
Mathias, Angeliki. Angeliki, Mathias.

1:06:23.959 --> 1:06:25.334
Nice to meet you.

1:06:25.501 --> 1:06:27.042
You already made a friend here?

1:06:27.334 --> 1:06:29.126
We came together from Greece.

1:06:29.417 --> 1:06:31.584
You came from Greece together?

1:06:31.667 --> 1:06:33.459
Yes. We came with your car.

1:06:33.542 --> 1:06:35.417
- Which car?
- The Audi.

1:06:35.542 --> 1:06:37.251
That piece of crap is still working?

1:06:37.334 --> 1:06:40.001
But don't worry
your son is an amazing driver.

1:06:40.917 --> 1:06:43.126
He only got us arrested once.

1:06:46.292 --> 1:06:47.876
Your friend is funny.

1:06:47.959 --> 1:06:49.334
He doesn't speak German.

1:06:49.459 --> 1:06:51.376
So much for all the books I've sent.

1:06:53.626 --> 1:06:55.334
Are you hungry?

1:06:55.501 --> 1:06:57.542
Should Helga make you a plate?

1:07:03.917 --> 1:07:06.001
Can you bring two plates please?

1:07:08.834 --> 1:07:10.417
This is Victoras…

1:07:11.167 --> 1:07:12.167
My son.

1:07:14.667 --> 1:07:16.917
- And…
- Mathias.

1:07:21.459 --> 1:07:22.959
Did you meet this handsome fellow?

1:07:23.709 --> 1:07:25.459
This is our Bjarke!

1:07:26.709 --> 1:07:28.334
Amazing breed.

1:07:28.917 --> 1:07:30.626
Obedient.

1:07:30.751 --> 1:07:32.667
And very expensive!

1:07:35.501 --> 1:07:37.167
Patrick… Where is Patrick?

1:07:37.501 --> 1:07:39.834
You have to see you brother.
You won't recognise him!

1:07:40.751 --> 1:07:43.709
If I'd known you were coming,
we would have celebrated differently.

1:07:43.917 --> 1:07:46.042
Where is my cake?

1:07:47.501 --> 1:07:49.459
Look how much your brother grew up.

1:07:49.542 --> 1:07:51.417
Patrick, you remember Victoras?

1:07:51.501 --> 1:07:54.209
- No!
- You met him in Greece.

1:07:54.917 --> 1:07:56.084
How could he remember you?

1:07:57.042 --> 1:07:59.792
Helga, let's get the sweets now!

1:08:00.126 --> 1:08:01.501
For the kids!

1:08:03.917 --> 1:08:05.917
Be careful, Patrick!

1:08:06.334 --> 1:08:08.126
Come outside and meet the others.

1:08:08.459 --> 1:08:09.876
Too bad Sasha is not here!

1:09:51.251 --> 1:09:53.292
Victoras, what are you doing?

1:10:01.292 --> 1:10:03.459
Stop. Quiet!

1:10:40.334 --> 1:10:41.959
Life is very different here.

1:10:43.876 --> 1:10:45.542
You get used to it over time

1:10:51.001 --> 1:10:52.501
I'm more responsible now.

1:10:53.376 --> 1:10:54.959
You can count on me.

1:10:56.209 --> 1:10:57.667
You drove us here drunk.

1:10:58.167 --> 1:10:59.376
You hit my dog.

1:11:07.542 --> 1:11:08.584
I wanted…

1:11:13.959 --> 1:11:15.292
It's not like this every day.

1:11:16.251 --> 1:11:18.959
We have our good and our bad days.

1:11:19.876 --> 1:11:21.792
Sasha is often away for work.

1:11:22.292 --> 1:11:23.834
And I've had enough of being alone.

1:11:25.042 --> 1:11:26.376
You have Helga.

1:11:27.667 --> 1:11:28.792
And Patrick.

1:11:30.084 --> 1:11:31.167
And Bjorke.

1:11:31.501 --> 1:11:32.667
Bjarke!

1:11:42.709 --> 1:11:45.084
I took Patrick to try diving.

1:11:45.626 --> 1:11:47.292
He didn't like it at all.

1:11:47.501 --> 1:11:48.959
He was afraid.

1:11:49.042 --> 1:11:51.376
He didn't jump.
Not even from one metre!

1:11:51.459 --> 1:11:54.167
You, when you were little

1:11:54.417 --> 1:11:56.417
you always told me your dream was to fly.

1:11:56.584 --> 1:11:57.834
You remember?

1:11:58.126 --> 1:11:59.792
This was your dream.

1:12:00.042 --> 1:12:01.459
I remember it well.

1:12:01.626 --> 1:12:03.917
Your grandmother always said
you should become a pilot.

1:12:04.042 --> 1:12:06.834
I said you should take diving lessons.

1:12:08.126 --> 1:12:10.292
I wanted to make your dream come true.

1:12:10.501 --> 1:12:14.334
You took me diving because I was restless
and I was getting on your nerves.

1:12:16.209 --> 1:12:18.042
I don't remember that.

1:12:19.084 --> 1:12:22.084
But if that was the case,
something good came out of it.

1:12:25.792 --> 1:12:27.667
Give me a drag.

1:12:41.751 --> 1:12:43.959
Do you want to drive?

1:13:33.292 --> 1:13:35.709
Will you help me take him inside?

1:14:00.126 --> 1:14:01.876
You must be starving after all this.

1:14:04.167 --> 1:14:05.542
Don't be silly.

1:14:05.751 --> 1:14:08.001
You are part of the family!
