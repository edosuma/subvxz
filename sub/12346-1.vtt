00:41.793 --> 00:44.713
<i>Okay. Oh, you know it.</i>

00:44.879 --> 00:46.239
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

00:46.339 --> 00:47.692
<i>- There we go.
- That's it.</i>

00:47.716 --> 00:49.296
<i>- That's good.
- Okay.</i>

00:49.384 --> 00:51.804
<i>- Okay.
- I'm okay.</i>

00:52.053 --> 00:53.263
- Ah!
- Shh.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.032
Do you want me to put a
pillow over your mouth?

00:55.056 --> 00:56.676
You gonna choke me or something?
What?

00:56.850 --> 00:57.980
Is it like
a new sexy thing?

00:58.143 --> 00:59.643
No, so Stella
won't wake up.

00:59.811 --> 01:01.291
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I'll just be quiet.

01:01.479 --> 01:02.809
Okay.

01:07.902 --> 01:08.902
Shh.

01:08.987 --> 01:10.407
I'm sorry.

01:10.572 --> 01:12.122
I'm
having a hard time.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.413
I'm a vocal lover.

01:16.703 --> 01:17.703
Oh.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.709
What was that?
Nothing.

01:19.873 --> 01:21.475
Just looked like you might throw up.
I'm fine.

01:21.499 --> 01:23.039
You're sure?
No, I'm fine.

01:23.209 --> 01:25.339
Is it me? Are you
nauseated by me?

01:25.420 --> 01:26.420
Come on.

01:26.671 --> 01:28.171
Baby, you're my bear.

01:28.339 --> 01:30.009
You look awfully nauseous.
I'm fine.

01:30.216 --> 01:31.416
Did you eat
a crab salad again?

01:33.511 --> 01:35.181
You did, didn't you?
No.

01:35.513 --> 01:37.183
Oh, no.

01:37.432 --> 01:38.432
Okay.

01:38.516 --> 01:39.516
Okay.

01:39.684 --> 01:40.694
Okay.

01:41.519 --> 01:42.899
That's fine.

01:43.563 --> 01:45.363
Stop. Just stop.
Sorry, it's...

01:45.857 --> 01:47.607
You're so sexy though.
Thanks, baby.

01:47.692 --> 01:48.692
You're sure
you're okay?

01:48.860 --> 01:51.030
Honey, I'm completely
and totally...

01:54.324 --> 01:55.454
Sorry.

01:55.575 --> 01:57.485
Baby, I think
I might be pregnant.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.040
That's great!

01:59.704 --> 02:01.924
Sweetie, that's fantastic!

02:02.373 --> 02:03.423
Ugh.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.780
- Sorry.
- Why don't we...

02:04.834 --> 02:06.634
Is it weird
that I came?

02:09.380 --> 02:10.860
They're gonna be
here in five minutes.

02:11.007 --> 02:12.377
I gotta poo!
You already pooed.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.653
I need to poo twice sometimes!
When I'm nervous I poo twice!

02:14.677 --> 02:15.863
You're gonna
have to poo later!

02:15.887 --> 02:17.257
Fuck! Fine!

02:19.057 --> 02:20.201
Stella, how do you
keep finding

02:20.225 --> 02:21.345
Mommy's dildo?

02:21.518 --> 02:23.848
Just put it away, okay?
No.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.060
When did she start saying
"no" all the time?

02:26.231 --> 02:28.441
I don't know.
Hide your unmentionables.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.400
Hide your bongs!

02:40.912 --> 02:42.752
What's that smell?
It's bong water.

02:43.957 --> 02:45.787
Hey! Welcome home.
Hi!

02:45.959 --> 02:47.419
Yeah, come in.

02:47.585 --> 02:49.915
If you decide to buy
the house, that is.

02:50.088 --> 02:51.758
They might.
They like it.

02:51.923 --> 02:54.053
Yes. Great.
Well, yeah, so...

02:55.093 --> 02:57.643
Sorry. I know it's annoying
to keep on dropping in.

02:57.804 --> 02:59.406
No. Not annoying at all.
Not annoying at all.

02:59.430 --> 03:00.770
What's annoying
about this?

03:01.015 --> 03:02.015
So guys,

03:03.434 --> 03:04.944
here's the thing.

03:05.562 --> 03:06.562
We'll take it!

03:06.729 --> 03:07.729
Oh...

03:07.814 --> 03:08.984
Oh, that was totally...

03:09.107 --> 03:10.277
All right.

03:10.775 --> 03:11.775
That was scary.

03:11.943 --> 03:12.943
We love suspense.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.149
Oh, boy. Look.

03:14.279 --> 03:16.359
Guess your daughter
found your vibrator.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.487
Stella.

03:17.574 --> 03:18.624
She just keeps
finding it.

03:18.700 --> 03:19.950
I don't know
what's going on.

03:20.118 --> 03:22.118
Stels, put that away.
No.

03:22.287 --> 03:23.472
Stels!
She just learned that word.

03:23.496 --> 03:26.166
Don't even worry. I think I have
that same one at home, right?

03:26.624 --> 03:28.294
But ours is in black.

03:31.254 --> 03:32.634
Black cock.

03:34.007 --> 03:35.377
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Dude.

03:35.592 --> 03:37.262
Maybe we should
sign some stuff.

03:37.427 --> 03:38.507
Why don't we.

03:38.636 --> 03:39.836
Yep. I think
we should do that.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.618
We sold our house!
We sold our house!

03:44.642 --> 03:45.942
We did it!
Whoo!

03:47.145 --> 03:49.265
Don't get too psyched
because you haven't sold it yet.

03:49.355 --> 03:50.435
You're in escrow.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.211
What's that bullshit?
Were you trying to fuck us over?

03:54.235 --> 03:55.296
What the fuck are
you talking about?

03:55.320 --> 03:56.672
I asked you months
ago if you understood

03:56.696 --> 03:58.446
what escrow was,
and you said yes.

03:58.573 --> 04:00.342
Just say it one more time.
Maybe say it one more time.

04:00.366 --> 04:01.760
You know, just
refresh our memories.

04:01.784 --> 04:02.784
Okay. Very simple.

04:02.827 --> 04:05.827
Escrow is a 30-day period
wherein the buyer of the new house

04:05.914 --> 04:07.544
gets to do
inspections and whatnot.

04:07.624 --> 04:09.254
And assuming
everything goes well

04:09.334 --> 04:12.554
and nothing changes with the living
situation to spook them or something,

04:12.670 --> 04:13.710
you close. Okay?

04:13.796 --> 04:15.336
So wait. Do we
have escrows on

04:15.423 --> 04:16.942
the other house we just
bought in the suburbs?

04:16.966 --> 04:18.426
No. You have no
escrow on that house.

04:18.551 --> 04:20.011
Why the fuck not?

04:20.219 --> 04:22.139
Because that house
had multiple offers.

04:22.305 --> 04:23.305
And you screamed
at me,

04:23.348 --> 04:25.188
"Do whatever you have to do
to get that house."

04:25.224 --> 04:26.484
Yeah, I remember that.

04:26.643 --> 04:28.283
So, I did it. So you have
no escrow there.

04:28.353 --> 04:30.103
And then I asked
you three times,

04:30.229 --> 04:32.019
"Do you understand
what escrow is?"

04:32.190 --> 04:33.690
And once again

04:34.192 --> 04:35.652
you just nodded.

04:35.777 --> 04:37.487
Just like you
are right now.

04:37.862 --> 04:39.822
This is how the real
estate crisis happened.

04:40.865 --> 04:43.615
Buyers can pop by
at any time, okay?

04:43.743 --> 04:45.243
Okay.
Okay.

04:45.411 --> 04:48.161
So, your 30 days "do not fuck up"
clock starts now.

04:48.331 --> 04:49.892
Could you just watch
your language, please?

04:49.916 --> 04:51.076
She's holding a dildo.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.250
That's not a dildo.
That is a...

04:54.504 --> 04:55.504
Toy.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.086
From a cartoon.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.676
Japanese, anime cartoon.
Mmm-hmm.

05:00.385 --> 05:02.595
Well, I watch that cartoon
every night.

05:03.054 --> 05:05.394
Ah, Jesus Christ,
man, we're getting old.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.556
Why do you say that?

05:06.683 --> 05:07.893
Because our friends
are dying.

05:08.893 --> 05:10.143
Who's dying?

05:10.353 --> 05:12.113
Do you remember Joe Waterston?
Yeah.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.975
Dead.
Really?

05:14.190 --> 05:16.110
Yeah. Had this little weird
mole on his shoulder.

05:16.401 --> 05:19.951
Was driving to get it checked out,
hit by a bus. Dead.

05:20.530 --> 05:21.530
Are you okay, man?

05:21.572 --> 05:23.412
No, I'm not okay, man.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.536
I'm freaking out about Paula
having a baby.

05:25.618 --> 05:26.828
I don't think
I can do it.

05:26.953 --> 05:28.764
Dude, you're gonna be a good parent.
Don't worry.

05:28.788 --> 05:30.748
No, I'm not.
I don't know anything.

05:30.915 --> 05:32.515
Do you know you can't leave
a baby alone?

05:32.542 --> 05:33.542
If you're at home

05:33.584 --> 05:36.384
and you want the baby to stay while
you go see a movie? Unacceptable.

05:36.462 --> 05:37.512
That I do know.

05:37.588 --> 05:38.774
You knew that?
I did know that.

05:38.798 --> 05:40.218
How the fuck are
you gonna have two?

05:40.299 --> 05:42.969
I don't even understand
how that physically works.

05:43.094 --> 05:44.238
I'm actually
not that worried.

05:44.262 --> 05:45.762
I'm a good father
to one daughter.

05:45.805 --> 05:48.165
I think I'll be a good
father to two daughters.

05:49.851 --> 05:51.351
Come on.
What?

05:51.436 --> 05:53.096
You're
not a good father.

05:53.271 --> 05:55.441
Fuck you. I'm
a good parent. Okay?

05:55.606 --> 05:56.646
Okay, okay, okay.
Yeah.

05:56.733 --> 05:58.752
Well, tell yourself that,
because before you know it,

05:58.776 --> 06:00.856
Stella is gonna be
a tween who hates you,

06:00.945 --> 06:03.945
and it's gonna be your fault because
you let her play with Kelly's dildo.

06:04.282 --> 06:05.702
Because you're
a bad parent.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.203
Me and Kelly
are good parents.

06:07.285 --> 06:08.725
Don't take your
shit out on me, okay?

06:08.786 --> 06:11.746
All I'm saying, thank God,
I'm having a boy.

06:11.831 --> 06:13.961
'Cause girls
are fuckin' hard.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.585
What are you
talking about?

06:15.668 --> 06:17.418
Man, it's just easier
with boys, you know?

06:17.503 --> 06:19.463
Like, when a boy
gets laid, it's awesome.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.670
When a girl gets laid,
it's bad.

06:21.841 --> 06:23.011
That's not true.

06:23.176 --> 06:24.486
You want your
daughter to have sex?

06:24.510 --> 06:26.470
You're gonna be like,
"Hey, Jimmy, good news.

06:26.637 --> 06:27.807
"Stella just got fucked.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.412
"Come on over
let's have some beers."

06:53.664 --> 06:55.674
Yay!
Yay!

06:55.833 --> 06:57.883
Welcome to Phi Lambda!

06:58.044 --> 06:59.134
Yay!

06:59.212 --> 07:00.802
This is such
an exciting year.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.473
If you're lucky,
and you make the cut,

07:02.632 --> 07:04.132
you will be
joining a sisterhood

07:04.217 --> 07:05.717
and making best
friends for life.

07:05.885 --> 07:07.175
Yay!

07:07.345 --> 07:09.425
We're getting a hot tub.

07:09.472 --> 07:10.682
Yay!

07:10.848 --> 07:13.348
We have all brand
new feather duvets.

07:14.185 --> 07:15.185
That's dope.

07:15.311 --> 07:17.691
And we got a new chef,
and we're going gluten-free.

07:20.775 --> 07:22.145
Hi. What are you doing?

07:24.946 --> 07:28.616
I totally should've offered it
to you first, man. I'm sorry.

07:28.741 --> 07:30.331
Pecking order, you know?

07:30.493 --> 07:32.043
Who hits it first?
No, you go for it.

07:32.203 --> 07:33.793
No, we don't hit
joints here, ever.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.849
That's against the rules.
You're gonna have to take that out.

07:35.873 --> 07:36.873
Cup!

07:38.543 --> 07:39.543
Cup.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.417
This is $12. There's
hash oil in the middle.

07:42.547 --> 07:43.547
Cup!

07:46.425 --> 07:47.965
Your parties must
totally suck ass

07:48.052 --> 07:49.552
if you can't smoke weed.
Am I right?

07:49.720 --> 07:50.720
Oh, damn!

07:50.805 --> 07:52.199
We don't throw parties here.

07:52.223 --> 07:53.273
No sorority can.

07:53.349 --> 07:54.949
According to the
Greek Council, we can't.

07:55.017 --> 07:56.387
Really?

07:56.477 --> 07:57.807
No, this is an actual,
real thing.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.267
In the United
States of America,

07:59.355 --> 08:02.145
sororities are not allowed to
throw parties in their houses.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.573
Only frats can.

08:03.734 --> 08:04.904
Google it.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.527
Oh, my God! Really?

08:09.740 --> 08:10.910
You just don't party?

08:11.075 --> 08:12.575
No, of course
we party, stupid.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.000
We just do it at frats.

08:14.078 --> 08:15.078
Yes!

08:16.622 --> 08:18.172
Phi Lambda!

08:23.045 --> 08:24.755
Hey!
Oh, hi!

08:24.922 --> 08:26.922
Sorry, if I interrupted.
No, I...

08:27.091 --> 08:28.402
I don't actually
know anyone here,

08:28.426 --> 08:29.695
so I was just
rereading old texts,

08:29.719 --> 08:30.839
so I don't look
like a loser.

08:31.012 --> 08:32.142
So was I.

08:32.263 --> 08:34.143
No one was texting me.

08:34.307 --> 08:36.057
Are you rushing
Phi Lambda?

08:36.225 --> 08:37.345
Yes, I'm Beth.

08:37.476 --> 08:38.596
I'm Shelby.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.399
This is exciting, right?
Yes!

08:40.563 --> 08:41.563
First frat party.

08:41.731 --> 08:43.270
Yeah, totally.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.397
Totally.

08:45.109 --> 08:47.279
Ten in the bucket.
Yeah, go.

08:47.403 --> 08:48.823
Hey, what's up?
Ten in the bucket.

08:48.905 --> 08:49.905
Okay.

08:49.947 --> 08:50.947
You're cool.
Get in there.

08:52.283 --> 08:54.123
Uh, no way.
This is all of my money.

08:54.243 --> 08:56.123
No, no. We got a runner!
Thank you so much!

09:15.806 --> 09:17.326
Oh, my God.
I feel like this entire room

09:17.350 --> 09:20.310
is just a giant arrow pointing
upstairs so they can fuck us.

09:20.478 --> 09:21.478
Oh, my God!

09:25.983 --> 09:28.033
'Sup? You wanna
go upstairs?

09:29.153 --> 09:30.453
Who are you asking?

09:30.613 --> 09:33.163
I don't wanna be rude.
I really don't have a preference.

09:33.324 --> 09:34.374
No.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.533
'Scuse!

09:35.701 --> 09:38.041
This isn't exactly
what I expected, you know?

09:38.204 --> 09:40.674
Yeah, you mean this
fucking sucks, right? Yeah.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.267
And does no one
know that the same song

09:42.291 --> 09:43.631
keeps playing
over and over again?

09:43.709 --> 09:44.709
Oh, my God, I noticed!

09:44.794 --> 09:46.438
And it makes me want
to blow my brains out.

09:46.462 --> 09:47.481
Hi, I'm Nora,
by the way.

09:47.505 --> 09:48.875
Hi, I'm Nora.
Yeah, no.

09:48.965 --> 09:50.325
Let's get out of here!
Let's leave!

09:51.092 --> 09:52.802
I am so happy I
found you guys.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.385
That was the most
weird party ever.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.698
I thought college parties were
supposed to be fun or something.

09:56.722 --> 09:59.022
Yeah, I felt unsafe.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.733
It was super
rapey in there.

10:00.893 --> 10:04.193
If I'm being honest,
I've never done drugs before,

10:04.355 --> 10:06.065
but college is
about new experiences.

10:06.232 --> 10:08.862
And here I am,
and I'm gonna do weed.

10:09.235 --> 10:10.235
Okay.

10:11.362 --> 10:12.532
Just take a little bit.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.324
Wow, that's a big hit.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.874
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

10:19.036 --> 10:20.956
Oh, my God. Do you need some water?
Are you okay?

10:22.373 --> 10:23.873
Oh, my God.
I think she's gonna boot.

10:25.001 --> 10:26.171
If she boots, I boot.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.419
You're beautiful.

10:31.716 --> 10:32.756
She's good.

10:32.842 --> 10:34.932
I think this is my thing now!

10:35.678 --> 10:37.322
I can't believe you
never smoked in high school.

10:37.346 --> 10:38.532
What did you do
in high school?

10:38.556 --> 10:40.136
I didn't tell
you guys. Okay.

10:40.766 --> 10:44.556
Um, I've been in a pretty intense
relationship since third grade.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.647
Oh, my God,
like Cory and Topanga?

10:48.441 --> 10:49.691
Stop!
Yes, exactly.

10:49.859 --> 10:50.859
That's such a good call.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.879
That's the cutest thing I've
ever heard in my literal life.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.073
Yeah, exactly like that.

10:54.238 --> 10:57.368
Personally,
I've made love to three men.

10:57.533 --> 10:58.743
Two were black.

10:59.243 --> 11:01.123
And one was Indian.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.536
Um, I've done like
everything, but...

11:05.583 --> 11:06.923
But what?

11:07.043 --> 11:08.423
Like everything you can do,

11:09.253 --> 11:10.593
but that one thing.

11:11.589 --> 11:13.629
You've never eaten
out a guy's ass before?

11:16.427 --> 11:17.637
No, no.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.263
No. I mean, I dunno.

11:19.430 --> 11:22.770
High school kind of sucked,
if we're being totally honest.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.443
Yeah, my dad was super strict,
I had really early curfews.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.997
When he dropped
me off at college,

11:27.021 --> 11:28.231
he gave me a rape whistle

11:28.314 --> 11:30.784
and this huge speech on how to
behave myself as a young woman.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.148
Yeah, I mean,
because of all that I guess

11:33.319 --> 11:36.659
I didn't really have much of a social
life when I was in high school.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.532
Girl, you don't have
to say it. We get it.

11:41.786 --> 11:42.826
You had no friends.

11:43.579 --> 11:44.749
Knock, knock, knock!

11:45.456 --> 11:47.286
Hey! R.A. coming through.

11:47.458 --> 11:49.128
What up, homies?

11:49.293 --> 11:50.503
Hi, Dustin!

11:50.669 --> 11:52.509
Kind of smells a little
funky!

11:58.260 --> 11:59.260
Hmm.

12:01.806 --> 12:03.636
- Okay. Are we done here, guys?
- Um...

12:03.974 --> 12:05.604
First warning,
just the first warning.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.478
I'm kidding.

12:09.814 --> 12:11.364
You're adults.
You're in college.

12:11.524 --> 12:13.534
You scared the
crap out of me.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.753
Were all of you
smoking weed?

12:14.777 --> 12:15.777
We smoked weed.

12:15.820 --> 12:17.320
God damn it!

12:17.488 --> 12:18.818
I fucking knew it!

12:18.989 --> 12:22.119
You don't do drugs.
Do you?

12:22.535 --> 12:23.945
Okay, we're cool?

12:24.120 --> 12:26.620
I'll see you fools later.
Hit me up if you need me.

12:26.789 --> 12:27.789
Peace.

12:28.124 --> 12:29.504
God.

12:29.667 --> 12:30.787
Oh, my God.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.170
I am so sick and tired of all
these guys coming into our lives

12:34.338 --> 12:35.668
and trying to
tell us what to do.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.192
We're not little
girls anymore.

12:37.216 --> 12:39.006
We are strong
adult women.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.321
Yeah, and sororities can't
even throw their own parties.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.965
We can't even
enjoy the frat party.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.715
We can't have
fun in our dorm.

12:44.849 --> 12:45.889
You know what
we should do?

12:47.351 --> 12:49.021
We should start
our own sorority.

12:49.395 --> 12:51.435
One that can party the way
that we want to. Mmm-hmm.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.522
And like,
most importantly,

12:53.732 --> 12:56.442
we can make sisters for life.
Yeah!

12:56.527 --> 12:58.130
I wanna be your sister.
I wanna be your sister.

12:58.154 --> 12:59.164
Okay. Oh, my God!

12:59.363 --> 13:01.913
BFF! BFF! BFF!

13:02.074 --> 13:04.624
I told you guys to
shut the fuck up!

13:07.037 --> 13:08.657
Poker night!

13:19.216 --> 13:21.386
Selfie stick!

13:24.305 --> 13:27.345
Yeah. So I've been designing
Outback Steakhouses.

13:27.516 --> 13:30.016
Congrats.
Lots of Outbacks.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.830
But, dude, tell me what's
going on with your app.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.234
Changing the world
and shit.

13:33.314 --> 13:34.734
You know,
one dick at a time.

13:36.609 --> 13:38.689
Seriously, that's a great idea, man.
Thank you!

13:38.986 --> 13:40.946
An app that makes
pics of your dick bigger.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.031
I meant to tell you,
I enjoyed your TED Talk.

13:43.115 --> 13:44.795
Oh, thank you so much.
Thanks for watching.

13:45.117 --> 13:46.487
You're so successful.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.829
Well, I'm still a cop,
which is not that bad.

13:49.914 --> 13:51.374
You know,
it's a lot of rules now.

13:51.457 --> 13:53.247
We gotta wear body
cameras and all of that.

13:53.334 --> 13:54.654
I don't know why
they gave me one.

13:54.752 --> 13:56.062
It's not like I'm
gonna shoot myself.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.506
But, hey, I figured
if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

13:58.631 --> 14:00.734
What are you up to, man?
How you doing? Yeah, that's real good.

14:00.758 --> 14:03.388
Work's been a little bit of
a bummer.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.677
They eliminated
the shirtless models,

14:05.763 --> 14:08.933
so now I have to walk around
in this monkey suit.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.766
Looks like
a really soft sweater.

14:10.851 --> 14:11.995
And then you
know what else, too?

14:12.019 --> 14:14.609
I'm the oldest person
there now by six years.

14:14.772 --> 14:16.572
I had to cover
for my boss, Mason,

14:16.690 --> 14:18.440
because he had to
go to his "prom."

14:18.776 --> 14:20.896
When did everyone in
retail get so young?

14:21.362 --> 14:22.612
Hmm.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.120
I just feel, like, really undervalued,
you know?

14:26.450 --> 14:28.200
Yeah, for real.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.247
- At least I have you guys.
- You do!

14:30.329 --> 14:31.829
- I love you guys, man.
- You do.

14:31.914 --> 14:32.964
Delta Psi, man.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.480
Once a week,
Delta week every Monday.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.583
Yeah.
Gotcha.

14:35.668 --> 14:37.668
So, uh, Darren.
Mmm-hmm.

14:38.254 --> 14:39.264
How much you
putting in?

14:39.630 --> 14:41.130
I'm going

14:42.466 --> 14:43.466
all in.

14:43.551 --> 14:45.301
Big hand!

14:45.469 --> 14:46.829
Man, what do you got,
a full house?

14:46.971 --> 14:48.061
Hopefully, one day.

14:52.393 --> 14:55.313
<i>Well, you done done
me and you bet I felt it</i>

14:55.479 --> 14:57.269
Oh, my God.
Our song.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.725
What's going on?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.320
<i>I fell right
through the cracks</i>

15:01.485 --> 15:04.145
<i>Now I'm trying to get back</i>

15:04.446 --> 15:07.866
<i>Oh, I won't hesitate</i>

15:08.075 --> 15:09.485
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

15:09.577 --> 15:11.497
<i>No more, no more</i>

15:11.662 --> 15:14.622
<i>It cannot wait</i>

15:14.832 --> 15:17.002
<i>I'm yours</i>

15:17.334 --> 15:18.504
Oh, my God.

15:18.836 --> 15:21.166
The Greeks believed
we were each half of a whole.

15:22.131 --> 15:25.551
Peter, you are the half
that makes me whole.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.054
This is happening!
Oh, my God! Is this happening?

15:28.137 --> 15:29.447
Look, I don't know
what the rules are.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.771
I don't know who is
supposed to propose to who.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.326
And you're not a ring guy.
You don't have to wear it.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.190
You know, I guess.
No. That's okay.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.102
Wear it for me.
All right.

15:37.271 --> 15:38.623
Will you marry me,
Peter McCallister?

15:38.647 --> 15:40.977
Yes, you know I will!
Yes! Put it on.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.355
Okay, one, two, three!

15:47.531 --> 15:52.121
USA! USA! USA!

15:52.411 --> 15:54.001
Did he ever tell
you about college?

15:54.079 --> 15:55.579
College was crazy, man!

15:55.956 --> 15:57.876
He used to
just crush it.

15:58.042 --> 15:59.792
Slay tang.

15:59.877 --> 16:01.127
No.
Oh, wow.

16:01.295 --> 16:02.875
You were out of
your mind a little bit.

16:03.047 --> 16:04.377
I was figuring stuff out.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.086
Yeah, figuring stuff
out knee-deep in pussy.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.257
Oh...

16:08.344 --> 16:09.554
I also used to...

16:09.720 --> 16:11.390
I ate pussy.

16:12.640 --> 16:13.890
Not as much as him.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.734
By the way,
is it cool...

16:15.809 --> 16:18.479
Can we talk about the living
situation real quick?

16:18.562 --> 16:20.402
Dude, don't sweat that.
Yeah?

16:20.481 --> 16:21.821
Darren, you can
move in any time.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.609
Dude, he's basically here
every night.

16:24.068 --> 16:25.898
Thank you so much!
Yeah. Right. Okay.

16:26.195 --> 16:29.235
Seriously, though.
Would it be cool if Darren moved in

16:29.531 --> 16:35.041
and then you did
not live here anymore?

16:35.245 --> 16:36.455
What do you mean? Why?

16:36.580 --> 16:39.080
I mean, we're engaged.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.919
What did you think
was gonna happen?

16:42.336 --> 16:43.730
That you two would
move into your room,

16:43.754 --> 16:45.964
and that I would
live in my room.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.723
For happily ever after.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.340
We're thinking maybe,
because Darren works from home

16:50.427 --> 16:53.967
that maybe we would
turn it into an office.

16:54.890 --> 16:57.690
And then, maybe one day

16:58.268 --> 17:01.108
uh, a baby's room.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.268
No, babies are real small.
They are.

17:03.399 --> 17:06.398
They're tiny, they're the size
of a little shoebox.

17:06.694 --> 17:08.204
Huh. Doesn't take up
the whole room.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.738
Think of a counter
argument, but I...

17:09.821 --> 17:10.821
Yeah.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.276
Dude, I was just
fucking joking.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.789
You were fucking...
Totally fucking with you.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.252
You know what?

17:16.412 --> 17:17.712
I need to go for a run.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.057
You're gonna go
right now for...

17:19.080 --> 17:20.641
I'm happy for you guys.
I love you guys.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.044
Bring it in, man. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.877
Love you, dude.
Love you, man.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.723
Teddy, don't you wanna grab
your shoes, at least?

17:38.934 --> 17:41.444
Look, ladies, the owner of this
house is super cool.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.230
He's like me.
He's cool, he's dope.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.524
You can do
anything here.

17:45.899 --> 17:49.819
You can party, you can stay up all night,
play on your phones.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.613
Snapchat that shit,
I don't care.

17:51.697 --> 17:53.027
And smoke weed.

17:53.157 --> 17:55.197
The question is can you afford it?
What's your name?

17:55.367 --> 17:56.367
Shelby.
Shelby.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.663
Look, I'm Team Shelby.

17:57.828 --> 17:59.498
What's your name?
Nora.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.248
Nora. I'm Team Nora.

18:01.832 --> 18:03.002
What?
Beth.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.288
Okay, I'm good.

18:04.418 --> 18:07.168
Look, girls, normally,
it's $25,000 a month.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.804
But I'm willing to offer
it to you for $5,000.

18:10.007 --> 18:11.587
Wow. Can you afford
five grand a month?

18:11.675 --> 18:12.675
No.

18:13.385 --> 18:16.175
Oh, I'm getting a call.
Hold on, please.

18:16.346 --> 18:17.506
Did his phone ring?

18:17.681 --> 18:19.431
I'm so sorry.
I have to take this call.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.310
It's another
ragtag group of girls

18:21.393 --> 18:22.753
trying to start
their own sorority.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.021
They're real
alternative, real edgy.

18:25.189 --> 18:26.269
What to do?

18:26.440 --> 18:28.001
Guys, we gotta act fast.
What are we gonna do?

18:28.025 --> 18:29.627
I don't know. We don't have
enough for a month.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.031
Shit, what do we do?

18:31.111 --> 18:32.422
I don't know.
You're looking at me

18:32.446 --> 18:33.757
and I don't
really know what to...

18:33.781 --> 18:35.531
Whoa.
Okay, guys.

18:35.616 --> 18:38.196
There is a beautiful centaur
sitting thoughtfully over there.

18:38.702 --> 18:39.832
Who are you?

18:39.995 --> 18:41.705
I'm Teddy Sanders.

18:43.624 --> 18:45.214
I used to live here.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.520
- Why are you limping?
- Are you okay?

18:47.544 --> 18:49.674
I just ran here, barefoot.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.047
Really far.

18:51.215 --> 18:52.215
Huh.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.194
You guys are thinking about
renting this place?

18:54.218 --> 18:55.218
Maybe.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.222
What do you guys want
with such a big house?

18:57.304 --> 18:58.644
We're starting
our own sorority

18:58.722 --> 18:59.812
outside the system

18:59.890 --> 19:01.850
- that can totally do whatever it wants.
- Yeah.

19:02.059 --> 19:04.689
Mmm-hmm. Like throw dope-ass
parties and totally rage.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.153
A sorority
that can party?

19:06.396 --> 19:07.606
Kappa Nu.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.479
What's wrong with
fraternity parties?

19:09.775 --> 19:11.605
What isn't?

19:11.735 --> 19:13.525
We threw
great parties here.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.741
Pimps and Hoes,

19:15.906 --> 19:18.116
CEOs and Corporate Hoes,

19:18.575 --> 19:20.405
Boise Boys and Ida-Hoes.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.414
They're, like, super sexist.

19:22.621 --> 19:24.541
Every party is, like, themed hoe.

19:25.999 --> 19:26.999
I mean...

19:27.084 --> 19:28.254
Jeez.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.707
Oh, no! Oh, God!

19:33.423 --> 19:34.473
Mmm-hmm.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.257
Yeah, I see your point.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.506
Honestly, though,
it's kind of a fucking moot point.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.675
We got to figure
out something else.

19:41.765 --> 19:42.885
We can't afford
this place.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.340
How much money do you guys have
between the three of you?

19:45.435 --> 19:46.975
Maybe a few
thousand dollars.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.772
That's if you really
pool it all together,

19:48.897 --> 19:50.567
and that's for
the entire school year.

19:50.691 --> 19:52.531
So use that as
a down payment,

19:52.609 --> 19:55.029
throw a rush event,
get a bunch of members.

19:55.279 --> 19:56.449
They'll pay their dues,

19:56.530 --> 19:58.820
plus you'll have an army of
people to make money for you.

19:58.907 --> 20:01.157
And then pretty soon, you're
a full-fledged sorority.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.253
Right? Do you guys have
the rental agreement?

20:03.412 --> 20:07.422
I don't understand one thing
that you just said to us.

20:07.541 --> 20:09.461
Last week,
I was sleeping in a bunk bed.

20:09.543 --> 20:10.543
Yeah.

20:10.627 --> 20:11.877
I can't make an Eggo!

20:11.962 --> 20:13.552
I can't make one.
I don't know how.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.590
We're 18.
We know what we wanna do.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.797
We have no earthly idea
how to accomplish it.

20:17.968 --> 20:20.298
I ran Delta Psi
for four years.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.717
I could definitely help you.
Okay.

20:23.015 --> 20:25.055
I mean, would
that be, like,

20:25.893 --> 20:27.603
of value to you?

20:28.186 --> 20:31.976
Yeah, that'd be,
like, of tremendous value.

20:32.316 --> 20:33.316
Really?

20:34.568 --> 20:35.778
We should, like, celebrate!

20:35.861 --> 20:36.861
Yeah!
Okay.

20:36.945 --> 20:39.405
Dude, who wants to
take a rip on the zip?

20:39.698 --> 20:40.967
Go for it!
Dude, check this out!

20:40.991 --> 20:41.991
Okay.

20:42.910 --> 20:44.750
I swear, we used to
ride this baby tandem.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.405
Check this out. Delta Psi!

20:48.332 --> 20:49.372
Oh...

20:49.458 --> 20:50.498
Dude, are you okay?

20:50.667 --> 20:52.457
I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm good.

20:52.628 --> 20:54.418
Legally, this is
not my responsibility.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.295
We'll take it.

20:57.341 --> 20:58.431
Dope!

20:59.843 --> 21:00.933
Are you okay, dude?

21:01.053 --> 21:02.253
Yeah, I'm totally fine.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.429
I'm really hyped.

21:03.513 --> 21:04.908
I think it's gonna be
the perfect house for us.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.075
Yeah,
I'm so excited, you guys.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.349
It's gonna be good.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.187
- I'll see you guys soon.
- Thank you.

21:09.353 --> 21:10.353
Thanks.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.437
Is that Teddy Sanders?

21:11.521 --> 21:13.151
Oh, shit. Oh, no.
Who are they?

21:13.231 --> 21:14.611
Go, go, go.
Guys, go.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.491
Go, get out of here.
I'll explain later, okay?

21:17.194 --> 21:19.034
Mac! Kelly! Hey!
Yo!

21:19.196 --> 21:20.196
What's going on?

21:20.364 --> 21:21.374
What's going on, man?

21:21.698 --> 21:23.118
What are you
guys doing here?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.200
You live here. Yeah, of course.
Who are they?

21:25.285 --> 21:26.445
Don't worry about them.

21:26.536 --> 21:27.536
Okay.

21:27.621 --> 21:29.041
So, I see you
guys are moving?

21:29.206 --> 21:30.456
Moving on up, yeah.

21:30.624 --> 21:31.714
Well, heck.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.686
You could have done that
when I was living here.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.210
That would have been nice.

21:35.379 --> 21:36.879
Yeah, I know.
Just weren't ready yet.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.554
I have a criminal record
now because of you guys.

21:40.384 --> 21:42.304
Look out.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.929
No, for real.
Like, it's hard to get jobs.

21:46.098 --> 21:47.138
So, it's been
really tough.

21:47.182 --> 21:48.451
So, what are you
doing here? Buddy.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.702
Yeah, what brings
you to the hood?

21:49.726 --> 21:51.226
You guys will
find out soon enough.

21:51.395 --> 21:52.395
What does that mean?
Huh?

21:52.479 --> 21:54.149
Don't worry about it.
It's cool.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.904
It's good to see you guys.
Kind of missed you.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.067
See you soon.

21:58.610 --> 21:59.820
All right. See ya.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.247
<i>Yo. You wanna rush
the coolest sorority ever?</i>

22:16.336 --> 22:17.586
<i>This is the one.</i>

22:17.754 --> 22:21.094
<i>Kappa Nu
welcomes you.</i>

22:41.278 --> 22:42.988
What the hell?

22:44.281 --> 22:45.451
Oh.

22:46.283 --> 22:48.043
There's people there.

22:48.118 --> 22:49.658
Somebody move in?

22:49.911 --> 22:52.081
Excuse me, ladies.
Excuse me.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.119
Hi.
Hi.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.747
What the fuck?

22:55.834 --> 22:57.594
What's happening here?

22:57.669 --> 22:59.629
"Kappa Nu. Wants you."
What the fuck?

22:59.713 --> 23:01.673
Hi! We're your neighbours.
Hi. Hello!

23:01.757 --> 23:02.757
Oh, hi.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.589
Mac and Kelly.
Hi, I'm Kelly.

23:04.676 --> 23:07.386
Are your parents around
or something like that?

23:07.554 --> 23:08.764
Oh, no, no, no.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.560
Meet the girls
of Kappa Nu.

23:11.058 --> 23:12.098
What's that then?

23:12.225 --> 23:13.595
It's our sorority.

23:16.063 --> 23:20.653
Hi, neighbours!

23:21.359 --> 23:23.699
Do you want
a beer or a mocktail?

23:23.862 --> 23:25.572
Like a mommy mocktail?
Congratulations.

23:25.739 --> 23:27.029
Oh, sure.
I'll take a mocktail.

23:27.157 --> 23:29.037
Get this woman a mocktail.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.407
Great. Thank you.

23:30.494 --> 23:32.504
Shelby will get them for you.
Thank you.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.122
Thanks a lot.

23:34.539 --> 23:36.369
What the fuck?
What are we gonna do?

23:36.541 --> 23:37.921
I don't fucking know.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.461
The buyers are not gonna
want to live next to a house

23:40.587 --> 23:41.837
with a fucking
sorority in it.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.232
Is now a good time to freak out?
No, no.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.456
Should I freak out?
No, no, no.

23:44.549 --> 23:45.985
Should I start screaming?
Come on. No, no.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.719
Okay, look.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.644
We've just gotta
convince them to chill.

23:49.721 --> 23:51.721
We just need them
to behave themselves.

23:51.807 --> 23:53.326
We just ask them
not to party while we're escrow.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.350
We'll be fine.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.774
As soon as we're not escrow,
go fucking apeshit.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.060
Hey, guys.

23:58.188 --> 23:59.688
Hey.
What's up?

23:59.773 --> 24:02.363
Um, can we have a quick chat
with you guys for a second?

24:02.442 --> 24:04.442
We kind of had
a question for you guys.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.911
You see, we live next door,
we just sold our house,

24:06.988 --> 24:09.028
and we're escrowing
for the next 30 days.

24:09.116 --> 24:12.446
And, basically, if anything happens
that spooks those buyers,

24:12.536 --> 24:16.366
they'll pull out of the deal,
and we'll own two homes and be fucked.

24:16.540 --> 24:20.710
So it'd just be great if
you could be mellow and low-key,

24:20.877 --> 24:23.877
and just basically not party for 30 days.
And that's it.

24:23.964 --> 24:25.149
Then we'll be gone.
You go crazy.

24:25.173 --> 24:26.359
We'll be out of
your hair. Yeah.

24:26.383 --> 24:27.383
Um...

24:28.343 --> 24:29.553
Well, here's the thing.

24:29.719 --> 24:34.559
A really big part of us creating
this sorority is because

24:34.808 --> 24:37.518
fraternities are
allowed to party

24:37.644 --> 24:40.364
and sororities are
not allowed to party.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.732
Really?
What?

24:41.898 --> 24:44.228
Yeah, so partying is
a really big deal for us.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.396
And you guys have
a daughter, I'm sure

24:46.528 --> 24:48.408
you'd want her to have
equal rights as guys.

24:49.322 --> 24:53.622
As a man, I could not
agree with you more,

24:53.743 --> 24:56.833
and could not
support your cause more.

24:56.913 --> 25:00.173
I think my wife has
some thoughts though

25:00.250 --> 25:02.840
on maybe why you guys
could approach this differently.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.246
Kelly.
What?

25:05.297 --> 25:06.337
Take it.

25:07.424 --> 25:09.184
Ladies, we can come
to some sort of

25:09.259 --> 25:11.089
compromise here,
can't we?

25:11.178 --> 25:13.558
I'm sure maybe...
No means no!

25:13.930 --> 25:14.930
'Sup, neighbours?

25:15.140 --> 25:16.180
Teddy?

25:16.266 --> 25:17.516
Welcome to soon enough.

25:18.602 --> 25:19.852
What does that mean?

25:20.103 --> 25:21.523
You don't remember
when I told you

25:21.646 --> 25:23.056
that you'd find
out soon enough?

25:23.690 --> 25:25.530
I think a lot of this
is going on in your head.

25:25.609 --> 25:27.239
I'm mentoring this sorority.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.650
Why?
That's a thing?

25:28.778 --> 25:29.778
Yes, it's a thing.

25:29.905 --> 25:30.945
Why are you doing that?

25:31.114 --> 25:33.494
I don't know.
Why do butterflies fly?

25:33.575 --> 25:34.655
To drink nectar.

25:35.410 --> 25:38.160
I don't know why things do what they do,
but what I do

25:38.538 --> 25:41.788
is facilitate the act of
partying in this house.

25:41.958 --> 25:42.958
What?

25:43.293 --> 25:44.843
So let's rage!

25:50.550 --> 25:52.140
Missed you guys.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.391
<i>These are the rules for
a successful sorority.</i>

25:57.474 --> 25:58.484
<i>Rule number one.</i>

25:58.683 --> 26:01.483
<i>Use these money buckets
to keep track of your cash.</i>

26:01.561 --> 26:04.481
<i>Five buckets a month
equals house rent.</i>

26:04.773 --> 26:05.823
<i>Rule number two.</i>

26:06.316 --> 26:09.146
<i>Keep getting pledges and you
can dress them up like idiots.</i>

26:10.320 --> 26:11.700
Minions! Minions!

26:11.821 --> 26:13.951
They got a hilarious
army of fucking Minions.

26:14.157 --> 26:15.877
I love Minions,
and now I have to hate them.

26:15.951 --> 26:17.511
They're making me
hate something I love.

26:21.665 --> 26:24.165
<i>Rule number three.
Throw the type of parties</i>

26:24.251 --> 26:26.001
<i>that show what you
guys are all about.</i>

26:26.086 --> 26:27.666
Hillary Clinton.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.724
Joan of Arc orders
you to pass the joint.

26:30.966 --> 26:32.426
First Lady
Hillary Clinton?

26:32.592 --> 26:34.182
Or Senator
Hillary Clinton?

26:34.302 --> 26:35.802
Or future President
Hillary Clinton?

26:36.596 --> 26:38.716
Oprah, we're out of beer.

26:38.807 --> 26:40.847
Everybody look under their chairs.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.851
You're all
getting beer!

26:44.854 --> 26:48.284
You get a beer, you get a beer,
you get a beer.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.855
I love you, Oprah.

26:50.026 --> 26:51.486
Could you
please be quiet?

26:51.653 --> 26:53.363
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

26:56.449 --> 26:58.239
<i>I cannot tell you
how thankful I am...</i>

27:00.954 --> 27:02.964
<i>I love you so much.</i>

27:09.296 --> 27:12.166
It's not fair!
They're too young!

27:18.680 --> 27:19.890
Why don't
they shut up!

27:20.056 --> 27:21.376
- Just stop it!
- Stop it!

27:21.474 --> 27:22.524
Shut up!

27:34.195 --> 27:35.195
Please.
Please!

27:35.280 --> 27:36.549
We're begging you!
All right, listen.

27:36.573 --> 27:40.163
I cannot shut down a sorority that's
trying to become independent.

27:40.243 --> 27:41.243
Why not?

27:41.328 --> 27:43.328
It's a PR nightmare.

27:43.413 --> 27:44.663
What's the nightmare?

27:44.748 --> 27:45.748
For example,

27:45.832 --> 27:49.342
"Sexist female dean
shuts down sorority."

27:50.420 --> 27:52.420
That is reverse sexism.

27:52.589 --> 27:54.089
Which is,
in and of itself,

27:54.174 --> 27:55.384
a sexist thing to do.

27:55.592 --> 27:58.932
There's no such thing as reverse sexism,
Mr. White Man.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.766
Oh, okay. Hey,
don't talk to me like that,

28:01.848 --> 28:03.018
because I am Jewish.

28:03.099 --> 28:04.099
I am a minority.

28:04.225 --> 28:06.595
Well, less of you.
Like Labradoodles.

28:06.686 --> 28:07.766
Okay.

28:07.937 --> 28:10.767
Look, if they get three strikes
they have to shut down, right?

28:10.940 --> 28:12.980
As far as I'm concerned,
they have infinite strikes.

28:13.109 --> 28:15.449
I see we're playing outside
the rules of the system,

28:15.612 --> 28:17.742
so why don't
we go to Plan B?

28:17.906 --> 28:22.366
Here's a little something
to change your mind.

28:22.994 --> 28:24.334
Mmm.

28:27.123 --> 28:28.753
Do we have a deal,
chancellor?

28:28.833 --> 28:29.833
No.

28:29.918 --> 28:31.288
You know what,
fuck you!

28:31.378 --> 28:32.588
Unleash the hounds,
sweetie.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.884
That's how you talk
in front of your daughter?

28:35.048 --> 28:36.442
Oh, I think we know
how to be parents.

28:36.466 --> 28:38.836
She's a baby, "A."
She doesn't retain any of that shit.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.387
Well, yes she will.
No, she doesn't.

28:40.470 --> 28:41.470
Watch.

28:41.805 --> 28:43.425
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

28:43.598 --> 28:44.638
Fuck.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.805
What's she watching on her iPad?
<i>Goodfellas.</i>

28:48.019 --> 28:49.899
Ha, ha, ha.
Jokes on you.

28:49.979 --> 28:51.819
I don't know what she's
watching on that iPad.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.646
What are
we gonna do?

28:54.776 --> 28:55.986
We have an inspection soon.

28:56.152 --> 28:58.282
The buyers could literally
drive by at any moment,

28:58.363 --> 28:59.993
say, "Oh, the house
has a few leaks,

29:00.073 --> 29:01.743
"and there's 20
fucking psychopathic

29:01.825 --> 29:03.155
"teenagers living
next door."

29:03.284 --> 29:04.584
We're gonna
have two houses.

29:04.661 --> 29:05.821
And then we'll
have no houses.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.120
And then we're screwed.

29:07.247 --> 29:08.247
We're totally screwed.

29:08.331 --> 29:09.671
Hi, sweetie. Hi, baby.
Hey.

29:09.833 --> 29:10.935
We just got to
get rid of them.

29:10.959 --> 29:12.103
I couldn't talk
to those girls.

29:12.127 --> 29:13.312
No. We had middle
ground with the guys.

29:13.336 --> 29:14.456
We could talk
to the guys.

29:14.546 --> 29:15.916
Yes!
They look at us like

29:16.005 --> 29:17.942
it was like their grandparents
walked into that house.

29:17.966 --> 29:20.506
Right? Stella is not gonna
turn out like that.

29:20.593 --> 29:21.593
No.
No.

29:21.678 --> 29:23.298
She'll be our best friend forever.
Yeah.

29:23.430 --> 29:25.390
She loves talking to us. Yeah.
We're a team.

29:25.473 --> 29:26.563
Right, Stella?

29:26.641 --> 29:28.481
Come over here, Stella.
Come here.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.190
Honey, wanna
come over here?

29:32.272 --> 29:35.022
What the fuck?
What the fuck is wrong with her?

29:35.733 --> 29:37.693
Play with your toy, sweetie.
Play with your toy.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.630
Just keep playing with your toy.
Give him a kiss.

29:39.654 --> 29:41.494
You know who
kids listen to?

29:41.698 --> 29:43.828
Their parents.
Celebrities. Their parents.

29:45.702 --> 29:46.832
What's up...

29:46.995 --> 29:48.325
Hey, Dad!

29:48.455 --> 29:49.455
You started a sorority?

29:49.539 --> 29:50.850
You're supposed to
be living in the dorm,

29:50.874 --> 29:53.004
not in some old
dilapidated mansion!

29:53.084 --> 29:54.134
This is what you want?

29:54.210 --> 29:56.230
You wanna live like some
sort of a drifter murderer?

29:56.254 --> 29:57.554
I can do whatever
I want here.

29:57.714 --> 29:58.858
Dad, that's the
point of college.

29:58.882 --> 29:59.922
I'm my own parent.

30:00.008 --> 30:01.968
When did you start
talking like Eminem?

30:02.051 --> 30:04.181
I'm gonna talk like this.
I'm gonna talk like that.

30:04.345 --> 30:05.465
This is ridiculous!

30:05.555 --> 30:07.175
Look at that pizza,
how old is that?

30:07.265 --> 30:09.175
The cheese is moldy on that.

30:09.392 --> 30:10.522
Cheese is mold.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.227
I can eat it,
whenever I want it.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.192
God, have you
inherited my stupid gene?

30:14.272 --> 30:15.272
Look at you.

30:15.356 --> 30:16.996
So you get to be just
as dumb as boys now?

30:17.066 --> 30:18.316
Is that what you
learned here?

30:18.401 --> 30:19.601
You are going
back to the dorm!

30:19.652 --> 30:21.532
No! This is where
I chose to live.

30:21.613 --> 30:23.453
It is only Kappa Nu.

30:27.076 --> 30:29.536
Looks like my
little girl's growing up.

30:31.831 --> 30:32.921
Thanks, Dad.

30:33.875 --> 30:37.835
I can buy your girlfriends and you
some brunch, if you want?

30:38.004 --> 30:39.264
I kind of need
some new jeans.

30:39.380 --> 30:40.590
Oh, we can go
shopping then.

30:40.757 --> 30:42.007
Yeah, cool.

30:43.259 --> 30:44.819
How did it go?
Yeah. They gonna be cool?

30:44.844 --> 30:46.071
Did you punish
them or whatever?

30:46.095 --> 30:48.515
I tried my best,
but there's nothing I can do.

30:48.598 --> 30:49.598
What do you mean?
What?

30:49.682 --> 30:50.682
Ah. You'll know.

30:50.767 --> 30:52.227
When they're two
years old, you can

30:52.352 --> 30:53.871
get them to do
almost anything you want.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.095
Get a little bit older,
and it's harder to control them.

30:56.231 --> 30:58.651
I do not understand
a word she says.

30:59.067 --> 31:01.737
But it was good
to see her.

31:01.903 --> 31:04.573
- The house is so quiet without her.
- Oh...

31:08.201 --> 31:09.201
I'm fine.

31:09.577 --> 31:10.577
Gosh.

31:11.079 --> 31:12.289
Beautiful child.

31:13.873 --> 31:14.873
Can I hold her?

31:14.958 --> 31:17.628
No, no, no. That's okay.
That's great.

31:18.002 --> 31:19.882
Is that a dildo
dressed as a princess?

31:20.171 --> 31:24.221
Nope. That is a popular
children's cartoon character of today.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.642
Thank you
for trying.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.220
- Hey, meanies!
- Hi!

31:30.390 --> 31:31.720
You called my parents?

31:32.100 --> 31:33.480
Yes, we did
call your parents.

31:33.601 --> 31:34.981
Yes. We did.
We actually did.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.061
Oh, really?

31:36.229 --> 31:37.979
It's 30 days!
It's just 30 days!

31:38.147 --> 31:40.227
It's 30 days!
Then we won't be escrow!

31:40.316 --> 31:42.686
Then we'll be out of your hair!
It's 30 fucking days.

31:42.777 --> 31:44.567
It's all
we're asking for.

31:44.779 --> 31:45.819
It's on.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.239
No, no, no.
No.

31:47.323 --> 31:49.083
Nothing's on.
Why would it be on?

31:49.158 --> 31:50.988
No, it's on.
But we're turning it off.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.389
If we turned it on, we can turn it off.
Can we just turn it off?

31:53.413 --> 31:54.413
It's on.

31:56.457 --> 31:59.087
Hey, Mac!
Hey, Mac!

32:01.170 --> 32:03.670
Great! I see more
of you have moved in.

32:05.008 --> 32:07.678
This is private property.
You're trespassing.

32:07.844 --> 32:09.184
Hey, Mac.

32:09.345 --> 32:11.595
Looks like Beth needs some
suntan lotion on her.

32:11.681 --> 32:12.971
I think
she's okay.

32:13.057 --> 32:14.847
Leave me alone.
You're not going.

32:18.187 --> 32:19.397
Where am I?

32:25.445 --> 32:26.605
Oh, no.

32:26.696 --> 32:27.906
I killed a girl!

32:29.032 --> 32:30.662
I'm on painkillers,
motherfucker!

32:30.742 --> 32:31.782
Kappa Nu!

32:33.202 --> 32:35.372
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

32:38.166 --> 32:40.376
Get away! Go away!

32:44.380 --> 32:46.010
Get out of here,
you animals!

32:46.132 --> 32:47.632
This isn't working!

32:47.759 --> 32:49.339
You're only
making them sexier!

32:51.554 --> 32:55.144
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

32:57.226 --> 32:58.896
What the hell was that?
Was that a bird?

33:04.442 --> 33:06.192
What the hell is that?

33:10.031 --> 33:11.071
Oh, no!

33:11.199 --> 33:12.239
Oh, God! Tampons!

33:12.408 --> 33:13.408
Oh, that's filthy!

33:13.534 --> 33:14.744
Stop it, you animals!

33:15.244 --> 33:16.754
Get off! Stop it!
Oh!

33:16.913 --> 33:18.043
Oh, my God! Mac!

33:18.414 --> 33:20.044
The other window is open!

33:23.836 --> 33:25.506
That was really funny!

33:25.588 --> 33:27.508
Where'd you guys get
so much fake blood?

33:27.590 --> 33:29.340
Oh, from our vaginas.

33:29.425 --> 33:30.425
That was real?

33:30.510 --> 33:33.050
Yeah, it was our
uterine wall sloughing off.

33:33.388 --> 33:34.928
You just threw...

33:35.098 --> 33:37.268
That was really gross.

33:38.935 --> 33:40.765
Ugh. Why'd
you do that?

33:40.853 --> 33:42.693
That was way
over the line.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.355
Whoa. That's,
like, super sexist.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.190
It was really
fucking funny.

33:46.359 --> 33:47.399
You would've been like,

33:47.485 --> 33:49.380
"It's so funny," if it was a bag of dicks.

33:49.404 --> 33:51.324
"Look, it's a bag of
dicks on the window!"

33:51.406 --> 33:52.616
No, that...

33:56.452 --> 33:58.082
A bag of dicks.

34:01.791 --> 34:03.791
Yeah, you got me.
That's funny.

34:04.669 --> 34:05.959
A bag of dicks.

34:07.964 --> 34:09.924
Here's the deal.
First inspection, tomorrow.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.880
We need help.
We have to get rid of the girls

34:12.009 --> 34:13.737
tomorrow, from the house,
between 10:00 and 5:00.

34:13.761 --> 34:14.761
Exactly.

34:14.804 --> 34:17.853
If our home owners see these girls,
our escrowment's gonna end.

34:17.931 --> 34:19.159
And these girls
are fucked, man.

34:19.183 --> 34:20.369
They're from
another fucking planet.

34:20.393 --> 34:21.829
Yeah. They're
worse than the guys.

34:21.853 --> 34:24.313
Look. Brainstorming
sesh starting now.

34:24.647 --> 34:26.647
Guys, a play
on a classic.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.476
We "hoes
before bros" them.

34:28.650 --> 34:29.741
No, no, no.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.004
No. That's not gonna work.
Why?

34:31.027 --> 34:33.027
Because you put hoes
before bros. Always. Yeah.

34:33.281 --> 34:35.300
It worked with the guys.
Why won't it work with the girls?

34:35.324 --> 34:37.293
Because girls are
much smarter than guys!

34:37.452 --> 34:38.581
That is sexist!

34:38.745 --> 34:40.495
- That's not sexist.
- What is it?

34:40.663 --> 34:42.123
Not when it's
against guys.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.326
That's not sexist.

34:43.498 --> 34:44.998
I don't even
know what's sexist.

34:45.168 --> 34:46.418
Hey, men's rights.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.996
No, fuck you!

34:48.170 --> 34:49.648
Are you okay?
Why are you itching?

34:49.672 --> 34:50.722
What's wrong with you?

34:50.797 --> 34:52.150
Did you get poison
oak or something?

34:52.175 --> 34:53.295
Here's the deal.

34:54.135 --> 34:55.135
We got bedbugs.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.849
- No! Gross!
- Oh, my God!

34:56.929 --> 34:57.990
I'm sorry.
I come to this restaurant.

34:58.014 --> 34:59.134
I don't wanna
be embarrassed.

34:59.182 --> 35:00.492
That's even worse!
Don't embarrass us!

35:00.516 --> 35:01.596
It's gross!

35:01.684 --> 35:03.662
Hey, it's fine, okay?
We're dealing with the problem.

35:03.686 --> 35:05.806
We tented our house.
We have to be out for three days.

35:09.650 --> 35:12.450
This is such a good idea.
These clothes have so many bedbugs.

35:12.528 --> 35:14.173
Just shut up,
we just gotta infest them fast!

35:14.197 --> 35:15.632
Here's some more pledges.
They're bedbugs!

35:15.656 --> 35:16.656
Boom!

35:16.699 --> 35:17.760
These are
my best pants!

35:17.784 --> 35:18.844
I don't care about
your fucking pants.

35:18.868 --> 35:20.748
All I care about is bedbugs.
Get it in. Hurry.

35:20.828 --> 35:22.908
It's so hot in here.
Can't see in this fucking thing.

35:23.039 --> 35:24.308
That sheet has
so many bedbugs.

35:24.332 --> 35:26.712
I feel them!
I can feel them! Get it off!

35:26.793 --> 35:27.883
Oh, my God!

35:32.548 --> 35:34.218
Hello, hello!

35:34.383 --> 35:36.803
We're entering!
Put on your clothes!

35:36.969 --> 35:37.969
Hi!
Hi!

35:38.137 --> 35:39.887
Welcome!
Hello.

35:40.056 --> 35:41.676
Great! Good to
see you guys!

35:41.849 --> 35:43.118
Good to see you again.
Welcome back!

35:43.142 --> 35:44.522
The place looks great.
Yes.

35:44.727 --> 35:46.227
I brought my boyfriend by.

35:46.395 --> 35:48.725
Just kidding. It's the mold inspector,
the old mold king.

35:48.898 --> 35:50.459
You don't think there's actually
mold here, do you?

35:50.483 --> 35:53.743
We kind of smelled a little something
weird when we were here before.

35:53.903 --> 35:54.963
Just wanted to
double-check.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.067
Why not, right?
Yeah.

35:56.572 --> 35:57.572
Great!
Cool.

35:57.615 --> 35:58.865
That's why we're here.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.344
What's going on
over there, by the way?

36:00.368 --> 36:01.368
New tenants?

36:01.536 --> 36:03.036
Yes, a new family
moved in next door

36:03.162 --> 36:04.723
and they're just doing
a little fumigating.

36:04.747 --> 36:06.997
Very nice,
quiet, lovely family.

36:07.124 --> 36:08.134
Family, huh?

36:08.209 --> 36:10.689
It must be pretty big.
That place is huge, like eight bedrooms.

36:10.753 --> 36:11.753
It is.
It is.

36:11.838 --> 36:14.258
This is a very
religious family.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.840
They're Jewish,
and they're lovely.

36:16.926 --> 36:18.546
Yeah, why did you
just do... You know?

36:18.803 --> 36:19.933
Anyway, they're lovely.

36:20.137 --> 36:22.427
I think there they
are now, actually.

36:22.515 --> 36:24.725
- Look! It's our Jewish neighbours.
- Oh, hello.

36:24.892 --> 36:26.442
Proof they actually exist.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.230
And she's pregnant.

36:30.398 --> 36:32.438
Got another
little Jew in the oven.

36:35.278 --> 36:36.380
Why don't we start
the mold inspection?

36:36.404 --> 36:37.404
Come into your house.

36:37.446 --> 36:38.866
Come on in.
Come into your home.

36:38.948 --> 36:40.698
Why don't we start in your kitchen?
Yes.

36:40.783 --> 36:41.833
This place is weird.

36:41.909 --> 36:42.989
Yeah.

36:51.127 --> 36:52.797
Uh, Teddy, where are
you gonna be staying?

36:53.963 --> 36:55.463
Uh, right now?

36:55.631 --> 36:57.431
I'm helping a bunch of
girls build a sorority.

36:57.592 --> 36:58.912
They're moving
into our old house,

36:58.968 --> 37:00.528
so I'll probably
just move in with them.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.850
It's a big step
forward for me.

37:05.057 --> 37:06.267
Okay.
Yeah.

37:06.434 --> 37:07.734
That's super weird.

37:07.810 --> 37:09.850
It's actually not weird.
It's actually super normal.

37:10.229 --> 37:11.874
Whatever makes you
happy, right?

37:11.898 --> 37:13.608
Darren, can you
back the fuck off?

37:13.774 --> 37:15.484
Whoa, whoa,
Teddy! Relax!

37:15.735 --> 37:17.695
I finally found somewhere
that I'm good at,

37:17.778 --> 37:19.068
where I'm valued!

37:19.238 --> 37:20.278
You want to
criticize that?

37:20.489 --> 37:23.409
What I was saying is that
it's just a little weird

37:23.492 --> 37:24.832
for a grown man
to be helping

37:24.911 --> 37:26.251
a bunch of girls
make a sorority.

37:26.329 --> 37:27.556
Doesn't that
sound crazy to you?

37:27.580 --> 37:30.140
No... Did you know that sororities
don't have the right to party?

37:30.416 --> 37:32.246
You know, there's no
legal right to party.

37:32.335 --> 37:33.995
Yes, there is a legal
right to party...

37:34.170 --> 37:35.800
Garf! Back me up, Garf.

37:35.963 --> 37:37.024
Man, just leave
me out of it.

37:37.048 --> 37:38.048
Okay.

37:38.132 --> 37:40.360
Look, I'm your best friend.
I'm just trying to be honest.

37:40.384 --> 37:41.434
Oh, yeah?

37:41.510 --> 37:42.600
Well, took you
long enough.

37:42.845 --> 37:43.965
What's that
supposed to mean?

37:44.180 --> 37:45.890
You didn't tell me
your biggest secret

37:45.973 --> 37:47.683
through all of
college, man!

37:47.934 --> 37:50.444
Where is this even
coming from right now?

37:50.519 --> 37:52.689
You told Garf first!

37:52.939 --> 37:54.729
He was bi-curious
most of sophomore year.

37:54.815 --> 37:56.225
He was the logical
person to tell!

37:56.317 --> 37:57.687
Sometimes you
gotta suck a dick

37:57.777 --> 37:59.297
to realize you
don't like sucking dick.

38:00.529 --> 38:02.699
You're just mad
because you're fucking lost.

38:02.865 --> 38:05.025
The rest of us,
we've moved forward.

38:05.201 --> 38:07.331
Garf's a cop,
Scoonie's got his own business,

38:07.411 --> 38:08.911
I'm getting married.

38:09.038 --> 38:10.868
And you're moving
into a fucking sorority.

38:15.753 --> 38:16.803
You know what?

38:16.879 --> 38:19.839
Those sisters are better brothers
to me than you ever were.

38:20.549 --> 38:21.589
You're not my brother.

38:22.051 --> 38:24.261
Don't say shit
you can't take back.

38:24.553 --> 38:26.893
Bros before hoes.

38:27.223 --> 38:28.723
Don't call them hoes.

38:29.183 --> 38:30.943
That's not cool anymore.

38:36.023 --> 38:37.983
All right, ladies,
we gotta talk finances.

38:38.067 --> 38:39.527
Okay, it's really serious.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.530
The fumigation took
so much of our money

38:41.612 --> 38:42.923
that we're down to
two money buckets.

38:42.947 --> 38:44.424
And I don't know what
we're gonna do about it.

38:44.448 --> 38:46.578
Okay. What if we use
our Minions to make us money?

38:46.659 --> 38:48.659
Oh, no. Their plates are
full cleaning the house.

38:53.541 --> 38:54.541
Ahhh!

38:55.501 --> 38:56.501
Maranda.

38:56.669 --> 38:59.509
Doesn't your brother sell weed
on some farm outside of town?

38:59.672 --> 39:01.012
Yeah, I did say that.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.173
My brother, Daffodil.

39:02.258 --> 39:05.588
Why don't we spend all of our
bucket money on Daffodil's weed

39:05.678 --> 39:07.428
and sell it at
the tailgate this weekend?

39:07.596 --> 39:09.056
Holy shit!
Fuck, yeah!

39:09.223 --> 39:11.683
We can make it
rain on them hoes!

39:11.851 --> 39:13.351
I love that idea!
We can make T-shirts

39:13.436 --> 39:14.896
with glitter glue.
Kappa Nu.

39:14.979 --> 39:16.769
- It's not a good idea.
- I like it.

39:16.856 --> 39:18.686
It won't make enough money.
Excuse me?

39:18.774 --> 39:20.335
Everyone at the tailgate's
gonna be selling weed.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.359
I got it.

39:21.444 --> 39:23.494
We're gonna corner
the market on weed

39:23.571 --> 39:26.491
by ratting out every other
drug dealer in town.

39:26.657 --> 39:28.617
That way Kappa Nu

39:28.868 --> 39:31.998
is the only group selling
weed at the tailgate.

39:32.079 --> 39:33.329
Fuck yes!

39:33.414 --> 39:35.884
F you guys!
That shit's brilliant!

39:35.958 --> 39:38.878
Guys, guys...
Guys, this is really risky.

39:38.961 --> 39:40.188
- We gonna sell...
- Weed!

39:40.212 --> 39:41.812
- We gonna smoke...
- Weed!

39:41.922 --> 39:42.922
What we gonna sell?

39:43.049 --> 39:44.049
Weed!

39:44.133 --> 39:46.683
God damn it!
God damn it! God damn it!

39:46.927 --> 39:49.427
You're acting like children.
You need to listen to me.

39:49.638 --> 39:52.268
I've been down this road.
I know what I'm doing.

39:52.516 --> 39:55.036
And I have some wisdom.
And I feel like I'm protecting you guys.

40:18.167 --> 40:19.167
Am I right?

40:19.251 --> 40:22.711
Teddy. We just voted and we've
decided it's best for you if you go.

40:23.255 --> 40:24.255
When?

40:24.381 --> 40:25.631
Just now.

40:25.716 --> 40:26.796
With our phones.

40:26.967 --> 40:28.087
What? No.

40:28.177 --> 40:29.177
No.

40:29.261 --> 40:30.761
No, you can't do
this to me!

40:30.971 --> 40:32.601
I thought
we were sisters.

40:32.681 --> 40:34.311
We were supposed
to be a team.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.351
Why is this happening?
You can't do this to me!

40:36.602 --> 40:38.272
I quit my job!

40:38.562 --> 40:40.062
Well, we didn't
tell you to do that.

40:40.231 --> 40:42.111
I liquidated my
401K for this.

40:42.274 --> 40:43.404
What's a 401K?

40:43.567 --> 40:45.067
I don't know, now!

40:45.194 --> 40:46.634
Look, I'm so happy
that you helped us

40:46.737 --> 40:48.157
get to this
place that we're in.

40:48.239 --> 40:51.579
You really let us spread our
wings and fly as women.

40:51.867 --> 40:52.907
This is all I have!

40:53.160 --> 40:54.620
I thought we were
in this together.

40:54.870 --> 40:57.210
You're not like us, dude.

40:57.748 --> 40:59.288
You're an old person.

41:03.212 --> 41:04.262
No, you're right.

41:05.548 --> 41:07.298
I've been playing
for the wrong team.

41:09.927 --> 41:11.467
I'll be seeing
you around.

41:12.054 --> 41:13.644
Okay.

41:17.643 --> 41:21.273
I wasn't, like, too harsh on him,
was I?

41:21.438 --> 41:24.608
No, no. You were fine.
You were great. You were good.

41:27.111 --> 41:28.111
It's fine.

41:28.696 --> 41:31.196
Well, now that
Daddy's gone,

41:31.490 --> 41:33.530
time to get feisty.

41:36.996 --> 41:39.246
Hello? 9-1-1?

41:39.415 --> 41:41.415
I need to report
three different addresses

41:41.542 --> 41:43.502
that are currently
selling marijuana.

41:43.669 --> 41:45.379
Yes, ganja.

41:45.963 --> 41:47.763
Get on the fucking ground!

41:47.923 --> 41:49.303
Get on the fucking ground!

41:49.466 --> 41:50.716
Put it in your mouth!

41:50.885 --> 41:52.175
Yeah, you like it,
don't you?

41:52.344 --> 41:53.572
Watkins, what are
you doing, man?

41:53.596 --> 41:55.506
This is your training day!
What's training day?

41:55.681 --> 41:57.061
This is your
training day!

41:57.433 --> 41:58.643
Get down!

42:02.605 --> 42:04.315
You're not in
the Academy anymore, private.

42:06.275 --> 42:07.605
Oh, sorry.

42:07.693 --> 42:10.863
Oh. You guys gotta come
to the precinct with us.

42:11.030 --> 42:12.870
You ride in the car.
We got bottled water.

42:13.032 --> 42:15.282
We'll stop at P.F.
Chang's, Chipotle, whatever you need.

42:15.492 --> 42:17.792
Passing that mold
inspection was a miracle!

42:18.120 --> 42:19.750
Praise be.
Yeah. No shit.

42:19.914 --> 42:23.634
If they drive past here
and they see the girls, it's over.

42:23.792 --> 42:25.437
The worst part of
this whole fucking thing,

42:25.461 --> 42:26.897
I'm so stressed out,
all I want to do

42:26.921 --> 42:28.211
is chill out
and smoke a joint,

42:28.380 --> 42:30.500
and my dealer doesn't have any weed.
He's fucking dry!

42:30.549 --> 42:31.669
Good luck
finding any.

42:31.759 --> 42:33.111
- Jesus Christ, man!
- Whoa!

42:33.135 --> 42:34.505
How the fuck did
you get in here?

42:34.678 --> 42:35.888
None of that
matters right now.

42:36.055 --> 42:38.617
I want to help you guys stop that
sorority before it gets too late.

42:38.641 --> 42:39.641
Really?

42:39.808 --> 42:40.938
That's right.

42:41.060 --> 42:42.060
I'm switching sides.

42:42.770 --> 42:44.610
Nice! That's awesome! Cool!
Yes!

42:44.772 --> 42:46.902
FYI, Kelly,
I'm still down.

42:47.441 --> 42:48.821
Stop it.

42:49.318 --> 42:50.678
Okay. I know
you're not gonna fuck.

42:50.736 --> 42:52.026
It still hurts
my feelings.

42:52.112 --> 42:53.782
He's just having a joke.

42:53.948 --> 42:55.818
Kappa Nu has cornered
the market on weed.

42:55.991 --> 42:57.081
Oh, no!
Oh, God.

42:57.243 --> 42:58.243
Oh, yes!

42:58.410 --> 42:59.971
Until Monday,
they are the only purveyors

42:59.995 --> 43:01.495
of weed in the greater
Ardendale area.

43:01.664 --> 43:03.475
Holy shit! Do you think they'll
sell me some? Oh, my God.

43:03.499 --> 43:05.379
No.
Fuck!

43:05.459 --> 43:06.919
They have seven
pounds of weed.

43:07.002 --> 43:08.962
They can sell it for $50
a gram if they want to.

43:09.046 --> 43:10.506
That's over $1,000
an ounce,

43:10.589 --> 43:12.049
$16,000 a pound.

43:12.132 --> 43:16.102
All said and done, if they move it all,
that's over $112,000.

43:16.262 --> 43:17.722
Dude.
We should do this.

43:17.805 --> 43:19.265
You're incredible
at math.

43:19.348 --> 43:21.268
Nah, I suck at math.
I'm good at weed.

43:21.433 --> 43:22.433
It's the same thing.

43:22.559 --> 43:24.189
No, this is weed.

43:24.436 --> 43:26.414
Just pretend it's
seven pounds of meat, just try it.

43:26.438 --> 43:27.938
Why would I even
be buying meat?

43:28.107 --> 43:29.227
I don't know.
You're hungry.

43:29.400 --> 43:30.690
Are you talking burgers?

43:30.776 --> 43:31.776
Steaks.

43:31.944 --> 43:33.574
How much does
a gram of steak go for?

43:33.737 --> 43:35.777
I don't know.
Why would I be selling grams of steak?

43:35.823 --> 43:37.123
Fair enough.

43:37.283 --> 43:39.163
Their plan is to sell
the weed at the tailgate.

43:39.285 --> 43:40.995
And believe me,
that's enough for them

43:41.078 --> 43:42.222
to stay in the house
through your escrow.

43:42.246 --> 43:43.656
God.
What do we do?

43:43.831 --> 43:46.151
If we steal their weed,
they won't be able to pay the rent.

43:46.250 --> 43:47.727
All of the members
that they've recruited

43:47.751 --> 43:49.131
will have to rush
other sororities,

43:49.211 --> 43:50.211
and that will be that.

43:50.379 --> 43:51.648
What's in this for you, bro?
Yeah.

43:51.672 --> 43:54.432
Honestly,
I just want to be valued.

43:54.591 --> 43:55.681
Well, it begs the question.

43:55.759 --> 43:58.199
How the fuck are we supposed to beat them?
There's 15 of them!

43:58.262 --> 44:00.472
No, they have
15 individuals.

44:00.639 --> 44:02.349
They're not
a cohesive unit.

44:02.516 --> 44:05.346
They don't understand the most
important rule of sisterhood.

44:05.519 --> 44:07.399
There's no
"I" in sorority.

44:07.563 --> 44:09.063
Yeah, there is.
There's two actually.

44:09.231 --> 44:10.321
Actually,
there's just one.

44:10.441 --> 44:11.611
No, that's a "Y."

44:11.775 --> 44:13.235
No, in the middle.
That's an "O."

44:13.402 --> 44:15.452
Two "I"s,
straddling the "Y".

44:15.612 --> 44:19.032
S-O-R-R-I-A-Y-O-R-I-T-Y.

44:19.366 --> 44:20.366
What?

44:20.451 --> 44:22.345
There's a "U" in there that you
guys are all missing.

44:22.369 --> 44:27.919
S-O-R-R-I-R-O-I-T-I-T-Y.

44:28.083 --> 44:30.173
- Sorriroi-tity?
- That's how you spell it.

44:30.336 --> 44:31.479
You think
the "tity" is silent?

44:31.503 --> 44:33.303
Look, we're all getting
sidetracked right now!

44:33.672 --> 44:34.842
Guys, bottom line is

44:35.007 --> 44:37.547
we need to figure out a way
to infiltrate that tailgate.

44:37.968 --> 44:39.088
Tailgate?

44:39.345 --> 44:40.345
Tailgate.

44:40.721 --> 44:41.721
Tailgate.

44:41.805 --> 44:42.845
Tailgate.

44:44.224 --> 44:45.234
Tailgate! Tailgate!

45:21.011 --> 45:22.011
High pie!

45:22.179 --> 45:24.559
Yes, you.
Come on! Pot pie!

45:24.723 --> 45:27.393
Weed for women!
It's only 20 bucks!

45:27.559 --> 45:29.649
Kappa Nu weed.
It's charity weed.

45:29.812 --> 45:30.942
High pie.

45:31.063 --> 45:32.290
Come on!
It's just $20 a slice!

45:32.314 --> 45:34.324
Come get your pie!
Pot pie, guys!

45:36.485 --> 45:38.605
First off, you look
fucking horrifying.

45:38.737 --> 45:40.567
What? It's a clown, man.
People love clowns.

45:40.823 --> 45:42.873
Jesus fucking Christ!

45:42.991 --> 45:43.991
Stop doing that!

45:44.159 --> 45:45.919
Don't do that again.
Okay? I will give birth.

45:45.994 --> 45:47.794
Guys, listen!
Here's the plan.

45:47.955 --> 45:50.615
I'm gonna get up on stage
and I'm gonna dance,

45:50.791 --> 45:52.961
distracting the girls
just long enough for Mac

45:53.043 --> 45:54.803
to run around
and steal the weed.

45:54.962 --> 45:57.422
Kelly, Paula,
I need you both to drive getaway.

45:57.506 --> 45:59.866
I can't have you running around
here 'cause you're pregnant.

46:00.175 --> 46:02.175
Wait, just you
dancing is enough

46:02.261 --> 46:03.641
to distract
the entire sorority?

46:03.720 --> 46:04.720
I don't know about that.

46:04.847 --> 46:06.517
That'll work.
It usually works.

46:06.682 --> 46:08.201
I don't even know
where we are right now.

46:08.225 --> 46:09.265
Okay.

46:09.351 --> 46:10.351
I'm ready.
All right.

46:12.146 --> 46:13.556
Oh, shit! Fuck!

46:13.814 --> 46:14.984
What's wrong?
Damn it.

46:15.315 --> 46:17.185
No! I don't have
the baby oil.

46:17.317 --> 46:18.317
What's the big deal?

46:18.402 --> 46:19.546
No, it's the most
important thing!

46:19.570 --> 46:21.570
With baby oil, you get,
like, two extra lines here.

46:21.655 --> 46:22.655
Really?

46:22.698 --> 46:24.218
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
God damn it.

46:25.534 --> 46:26.584
All right, let's go!

46:26.994 --> 46:28.414
Ooh, that's hot!

46:28.579 --> 46:30.659
Oh, that's really hot!
Ow! It burns!

46:30.747 --> 46:31.747
Rub that shit in.

46:31.874 --> 46:34.384
All right, rub it in.
Rub it in.

46:34.460 --> 46:35.460
Jeez.

46:35.544 --> 46:36.754
Oh, my God!
God bless you, kid.

46:36.837 --> 46:37.877
Kelly?
What?

46:37.963 --> 46:40.383
What the fuck are you doing?
We're in a rush, Mac.

46:40.507 --> 46:42.217
Come on, Mac.
Get his thighs. Okay.

46:43.051 --> 46:44.195
<i>Yo, what's up!
Clear the stage,</i>

46:44.219 --> 46:45.719
<i>clear the stage!</i>

46:45.888 --> 46:47.098
<i>I got something to say.</i>

46:47.264 --> 46:49.894
<i>This song right here goes out
to my girls in Kappa Nu.</i>

46:50.058 --> 46:53.058
<i>I know we've been going through
some rough times lately.</i>

46:53.228 --> 46:54.428
<i>But I love you.</i>

46:55.856 --> 46:57.066
<i>DJ, let's shake
that booty.</i>

46:57.232 --> 46:58.402
You got this,
right, Beth?

46:58.567 --> 46:59.807
Yes, I got this.
I'm right here.

47:34.019 --> 47:35.019
Fuck!

47:50.953 --> 47:52.663
No! He showed dick!

47:54.665 --> 47:55.705
Oh, no!

47:55.874 --> 47:57.544
The weed!
Oh, shit!

47:57.709 --> 47:58.709
It's all gone!

47:58.877 --> 48:01.457
Oh, my God!
It's all gone! It's all gone!

48:02.297 --> 48:04.467
Chester the fucking
Cheetah took our weed!

48:04.716 --> 48:06.036
Get the fucking
bag of weed!

48:07.553 --> 48:08.643
Get the weed!

48:11.348 --> 48:12.978
God, I hate clowns!

48:13.100 --> 48:14.310
Get out of the way!

48:15.686 --> 48:17.806
Get another exit.
Find the exit!

48:17.896 --> 48:19.216
I'm blocked!
I'll get another car!

48:19.398 --> 48:21.018
Go! Go!
Oh, No!

48:35.747 --> 48:37.037
Move, move, move!

48:37.291 --> 48:39.001
Fuck!

48:39.084 --> 48:40.254
Get out of the way!

48:47.217 --> 48:48.677
I got your weed!

48:49.011 --> 48:50.011
Move!

48:50.679 --> 48:52.259
Which one is it?
Where's the weed?

48:57.561 --> 48:58.841
Give me
the fucking weed!

49:01.940 --> 49:03.190
Who's laughing
now, clown?

49:03.525 --> 49:04.645
Who's laughing now?
Ow! Stop!

49:05.944 --> 49:07.954
It's garbage!
It's not weed!

49:08.113 --> 49:09.113
Oh, fuck!

49:09.197 --> 49:10.407
The weed! The weed!

49:11.575 --> 49:12.615
Go for it!

49:14.328 --> 49:15.408
Oh, shit!

49:16.204 --> 49:17.914
Okay, wait! Mac,

49:18.957 --> 49:20.537
you can do this.

49:27.549 --> 49:29.219
<i>4-20!</i>

49:35.140 --> 49:36.140
Oh, fuck!

49:48.070 --> 49:49.320
On your right!
Take it!

49:49.404 --> 49:51.704
I'm All-State track and field, bitch!

50:17.349 --> 50:18.349
Come on!

50:20.435 --> 50:21.595
Come on!

50:21.687 --> 50:22.937
Hurry!

50:27.317 --> 50:28.317
Oh, shit!

50:28.443 --> 50:29.443
Here she comes!

50:30.612 --> 50:33.122
Free weed! Take it!
Free weed! Weed for everyone!

50:33.615 --> 50:34.655
Free weed!
Free weed!

50:38.954 --> 50:41.374
That's all our weed!
How are we gonna pay rent?

50:42.124 --> 50:44.884
You're really turning me on
with your muscles right now.

50:45.001 --> 50:46.091
Two pounds coming!

50:46.169 --> 50:47.669
You look...
Are you in pain?

50:47.754 --> 50:49.554
They're just a little heavy.
Yeah. Yeah.

50:49.840 --> 50:51.970
<i>I love you!</i> Shit!

50:52.134 --> 50:55.764
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

50:55.971 --> 50:57.471
Ah!

50:58.014 --> 50:59.024
Oh, fuck!

50:59.182 --> 51:02.812
- This is a fucking shame, but it's also pretty fun.
- Whoo...

51:02.978 --> 51:04.018
Thank you, dude.
Yeah.

51:04.104 --> 51:05.944
Dude, those girls
were out of control!

51:06.106 --> 51:09.736
No, those girls were out of
control until we controlled them.

51:09.901 --> 51:10.962
You really controlled them.

51:10.986 --> 51:12.130
You have to
remind yourself that

51:12.154 --> 51:14.114
any situation is
actually controllable

51:14.281 --> 51:18.411
because parents are smart and kids,
by comparison, are fucking stupid.

51:18.577 --> 51:20.537
You have it figured out.
You can't do anything

51:20.704 --> 51:23.794
until you know the answer
to one simple question.

51:23.957 --> 51:25.627
"Who is Teddy Sanders?"
Mmm.

51:25.792 --> 51:27.632
It's a very important
question to ask yourself.

51:27.669 --> 51:30.629
Before I got anywhere
in life, I asked myself,

51:30.797 --> 51:32.047
"Who is Mac Radner?"

51:32.215 --> 51:34.005
And I said,
"Who are you, Kelly Dhundee?"

51:34.301 --> 51:35.301
Your maiden
name's Dundee?

51:35.343 --> 51:37.223
No, it's got
an "H." Dhundee.

51:37.345 --> 51:38.345
Like <i>Crocodile Dundee?</i>

51:38.513 --> 51:40.523
It's "Dhundee."
It's a different name altogether.

51:40.682 --> 51:42.910
I know it's a different name,
but it's just a coincidence.

51:42.934 --> 51:43.944
<i>Crocodile Dundee.</i>

51:44.019 --> 51:45.399
It's nothing like it!

51:45.562 --> 51:47.112
No. Nothing like that.

51:47.189 --> 51:49.779
But anyway, that's what you need to know.
Who is Teddy Sanders?

51:49.983 --> 51:51.210
Buddy, what are
you doing today?

51:51.234 --> 51:52.404
Yeah, what's your...

51:52.486 --> 51:54.196
What your overall
game plan here?

51:54.362 --> 51:55.532
Just in life.

51:55.697 --> 51:58.827
I'll probably play
some games on my phone,

51:58.992 --> 52:02.042
and walk around for a little
bit until I tire myself out,

52:02.204 --> 52:04.294
then go to sleep in my car.

52:04.873 --> 52:06.123
Probably.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.210
So sad.

52:09.211 --> 52:12.211
Um, do you wanna
maybe crash here?

52:12.631 --> 52:14.301
Really, I won't
take up too much room?

52:14.382 --> 52:15.662
You could sleep
in Stella's room.

52:15.759 --> 52:18.049
She takes up
this much space.

52:18.220 --> 52:19.350
Yeah.

52:23.433 --> 52:24.433
Thank you, guys.

52:24.601 --> 52:25.731
No, thank you.

52:26.186 --> 52:27.306
It means a lot to me.

52:27.395 --> 52:29.435
I can see that.
It's not that big a deal.

52:29.523 --> 52:31.363
No, it is a big deal.

52:32.859 --> 52:33.899
Thank you.
Okay.

52:36.112 --> 52:37.532
Thank you.

52:37.697 --> 52:39.258
Do you have any more of these?

52:39.282 --> 52:41.622
Yes, there's heaps in the kitchen.
Help yourself.

52:41.785 --> 52:42.945
Are they baby food?

52:43.078 --> 52:44.248
Technically.

52:44.412 --> 52:46.212
- Babies eat good food.
- Yeah.

52:46.373 --> 52:47.583
This is awesome.

52:47.749 --> 52:48.959
Go get them.

52:54.589 --> 52:56.879
That's cute. Look at him.

52:58.301 --> 53:01.391
He inhaled so much weed smoke
he tuckered himself out.

53:03.306 --> 53:04.676
All right.

53:07.102 --> 53:08.852
Guys, we lost
our nest egg.

53:09.020 --> 53:10.980
We lost all of our weed
and our rent is due.

53:11.064 --> 53:12.194
What are we
supposed to do?

53:12.274 --> 53:13.417
Beth, what happened?
I thought you were the one

53:13.441 --> 53:14.710
stopping the old people
from getting the weed.

53:14.734 --> 53:16.284
No! Do not blame me!

53:16.444 --> 53:17.844
You saw what was
happening up there.

53:17.904 --> 53:20.454
I am a human woman.
I had to watch that.

53:20.657 --> 53:22.457
I was on the whipped cream.
You were on the...

53:22.492 --> 53:23.636
We watch things together...

53:23.660 --> 53:26.120
She was in charge of the weed.
You were in charge of the weed.

53:26.288 --> 53:28.368
No, no! Stop it!

53:28.540 --> 53:30.100
Stop it, don't you
see what's happening?

53:30.792 --> 53:32.395
This is what the old
people want us to do.

53:32.419 --> 53:33.959
They wanna tear us apart.

53:34.212 --> 53:37.472
They know that if we're a united front,
we can't lose.

53:37.549 --> 53:39.299
Because we are sisters.

53:39.467 --> 53:40.695
And for the first
time in my life,

53:40.719 --> 53:41.919
I feel like I
belong right now.

53:41.970 --> 53:44.390
This is so much better than I
ever thought college could be.

53:44.556 --> 53:48.266
This is the most fun I've ever
had and I went to space camp.

53:48.435 --> 53:49.805
I haven't slept in,
like, a week.

53:49.978 --> 53:51.539
I just don't want to
miss out on anything.

53:51.563 --> 53:52.653
You guys are so much fun.

53:52.814 --> 53:54.444
We're never gonna
lose each other.

53:54.608 --> 53:56.858
I mean, what do you call a house
full of united women?

53:57.319 --> 53:58.319
A brothel.

53:58.403 --> 53:59.863
No, man.

53:59.946 --> 54:01.066
A sorority.

54:01.656 --> 54:02.656
Oh...

54:02.824 --> 54:04.664
Okay. This is the problem.

54:04.993 --> 54:06.262
We're never gonna
solve our money issues

54:06.286 --> 54:07.966
when we're in this
war with the old people.

54:07.996 --> 54:09.682
What can we do?
We're gonna give the old people

54:09.706 --> 54:11.142
a taste of their own
medicine. All right?

54:11.166 --> 54:13.166
They tried to tear us apart.
Yeah.

54:13.335 --> 54:15.335
So, what are
we gonna do?

54:17.047 --> 54:18.127
We're gonna
tear them apart!

54:18.256 --> 54:19.336
Yeah.

54:19.674 --> 54:22.094
I mean, unless you guys think
that's too intense of a plan.

54:22.177 --> 54:26.387
Shelby, they would never say you
were too intense if you were a man.

54:26.890 --> 54:29.390
Yeah, own that shit, queen.
Yeah.

54:29.559 --> 54:32.649
Let's do this,
team! Yeah!

54:35.774 --> 54:37.324
Ah. What do
we think of that?

54:38.318 --> 54:40.698
"Oh, my prince,
come for me!

54:41.404 --> 54:42.414
"Come for me."

54:42.489 --> 54:44.609
"No, I won't. I'm not coming for you."

54:44.824 --> 54:46.794
Yellow stars.

54:47.494 --> 54:49.044
What color for
her dress? Mmm?

54:51.373 --> 54:52.713
What is
the water doing?

54:52.874 --> 54:54.004
It's boiling.

54:54.167 --> 54:56.537
Pretty cool, huh?
What we do now,

54:56.711 --> 54:58.881
we're gonna add
the eggs to it. Okay?

54:59.047 --> 55:00.567
You put eggs in the water?
Yeah. Watch.

55:01.883 --> 55:03.433
- Did you hear that?
- Ah!

55:03.593 --> 55:04.593
It's hot!

55:04.761 --> 55:06.364
Oh, dude, don't fucking touch it!
I told you it's hot!

55:06.388 --> 55:09.018
Oh, my gosh!
I thought it was like Jacuzzi hot.

55:09.182 --> 55:11.062
- No, it's boiling hot!
- Oh.

55:11.309 --> 55:14.099
Now, we add the eggs,
and we hard-boil them, okay?

55:14.270 --> 55:16.270
Don't put the eggs in there.
It's gonna melt them.

55:16.356 --> 55:19.026
No, it hard-boils them.
It makes them hard.

55:19.192 --> 55:20.742
Why would it
make eggs hard?

55:20.902 --> 55:22.782
What do you mean,
"Why would it make eggs hard?"

55:22.862 --> 55:24.702
It makes pasta soft.

55:25.615 --> 55:26.615
Whoa.

55:26.908 --> 55:28.078
That's a good point.

55:29.244 --> 55:30.504
She looks fantastic.

55:30.745 --> 55:31.745
Look at this.

55:31.830 --> 55:33.250
I think this is
a gorgeous color.

55:34.916 --> 55:37.786
- Oh, I love coloring in.
- I love it!

55:38.420 --> 55:40.260
She's quite overdressed
really, isn't she?

55:40.422 --> 55:44.262
She's just in a garden
somewhere in a ball gown.

55:44.759 --> 55:47.049
Do you see people sometimes
that I don't see?

55:48.555 --> 55:49.965
You can tell me.

55:50.140 --> 55:52.390
Honey,
I'm home!

55:52.559 --> 55:53.744
I've always
wanted to say that.

55:53.768 --> 55:55.008
It's fun.
I say it all the time.

55:55.061 --> 55:56.691
Really?
Yeah.

55:57.772 --> 56:00.152
<i>"Dear Mac, I know
everything seemed good between us,</i>

56:00.233 --> 56:03.113
<i>"but I've been lying to you and myself.
I'm freaking out. From Kelly."</i>

56:03.278 --> 56:04.278
What?

56:04.320 --> 56:06.450
What's she talking about?
That's gotta be a joke.

56:06.614 --> 56:08.074
She must be
fucking with me.

56:08.241 --> 56:09.451
Yeah, she's joking around.

56:18.001 --> 56:19.671
That is so fucked up.
You bad, girl!

56:19.753 --> 56:21.383
Oh, yeah. It's on!

56:21.629 --> 56:23.629
I'm gonna call her.
Definitely call her.

56:23.798 --> 56:25.968
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck. He's calling.

56:26.134 --> 56:27.486
Hang up, hang up.
Decline, decline.

56:27.510 --> 56:28.600
What's going on right now?

56:28.762 --> 56:30.932
- It's okay!
- Hang it up!

56:33.141 --> 56:35.621
Just stay chill. Everything's fine.
What should I do right now?

56:41.274 --> 56:42.284
Huh?

56:58.333 --> 57:00.463
Where did she go?

57:00.627 --> 57:02.837
I know exactly
where she went.

57:03.421 --> 57:04.461
What?

57:10.845 --> 57:13.925
Mac, I've been up all night!
I'm worried sick!

57:14.099 --> 57:17.019
Please just text me
something. I'm worried.

57:23.024 --> 57:24.034
What?

57:35.245 --> 57:36.445
Fucking Jimmy.

57:36.538 --> 57:37.578
Let's go, I'm hungry!

57:37.705 --> 57:38.825
Trying to get
this tweet out.

57:38.915 --> 57:39.995
How do you
spell Trump?

57:40.083 --> 57:41.383
Jimmy.

57:41.543 --> 57:43.383
Hey, what's up, Kel?
Where is he?

57:43.711 --> 57:45.381
Where's who?
You're lying to me!

57:45.463 --> 57:47.673
You're a fucking terrible actor!
Tell me where he is!

57:47.757 --> 57:48.837
Uh, I don't know.

57:49.008 --> 57:51.112
He told me that you'd pretend
you didn't know where he was.

57:51.136 --> 57:52.296
Tell me where he is!
Ow, no.

57:52.387 --> 57:53.427
Hey, Kel!

57:53.596 --> 57:56.096
Where is Mac? Mac is missing, and
Jimmy knows where he is.

57:56.266 --> 57:58.266
Fucking tell her
where the fuck he is!

57:58.434 --> 57:59.870
I was with you last night.
I don't know.

57:59.894 --> 58:02.064
I know you're protecting
some stupid bro code.

58:02.147 --> 58:03.517
Just tell me
where he is.

58:03.606 --> 58:04.708
Bro code?
No, there's no bro code.

58:04.732 --> 58:06.544
He likes you more than me.
He tells me that every day.

58:06.568 --> 58:08.504
You're fucking lying to me, Jimmy!
Tell me where he is!

58:08.528 --> 58:09.648
I'm not lying.

58:09.737 --> 58:11.417
Excuse me. Why is
there so much language...

58:11.447 --> 58:12.447
This is an emergency!

58:12.574 --> 58:14.844
My husband Mac has vanished,
and this man knows where he is!

58:14.868 --> 58:16.238
Well, tell her!
Tell me!

58:16.327 --> 58:17.577
Tell her!
Fucking tell her!

58:17.829 --> 58:18.829
Whoa! Oh!

58:18.913 --> 58:20.273
You don't have to do that.
Tell me!

58:23.543 --> 58:25.423
He's in jail
for child porn!

58:25.545 --> 58:27.875
What? No! I'm lying!
I don't know where he is!

58:27.964 --> 58:29.344
No, no, no!

58:29.424 --> 58:30.568
Call him on the phone now!
Call him!

58:30.592 --> 58:31.632
You deserved that, Jimmy.

58:31.759 --> 58:33.929
Hold on! Hold on!
Call him!

58:34.012 --> 58:35.682
Here, here.
Fuck it!

58:37.599 --> 58:38.929
It broke the skin.

58:39.100 --> 58:40.310
<i>Kelly?</i>

58:40.476 --> 58:42.163
<i>Why do you have Jimmy's phone?
Where are you?</i>

58:42.187 --> 58:43.987
<i>Are you around here? Are you
hiding somewhere?</i>

58:44.022 --> 58:45.702
Where are you?
I'm in your office!

58:45.773 --> 58:47.283
I've been looking for you.

58:47.442 --> 58:48.544
<i>I went where you
told me to meet you!</i>

58:48.568 --> 58:49.608
Where are you?

58:49.694 --> 58:52.164
In Sydney, Australia!
<i>What?</i>

58:52.238 --> 58:53.658
Outside the
Opera House!

58:53.865 --> 58:55.065
You're in Australia?

58:55.158 --> 58:58.038
Yeah, I just got off a plane.
I've been on a plane for 18 hours!

58:58.328 --> 58:59.448
What's happening?

58:59.537 --> 59:00.577
We've been hacked!

59:01.247 --> 59:03.577
"Kappa Nu fooled you."

59:03.750 --> 59:04.920
Kappa Nu?

59:05.084 --> 59:07.054
Prank war!
Airbags, airbags!

59:07.128 --> 59:08.168
Airbags!

59:08.296 --> 59:11.046
<i>Airbags! This is not a drill!
All butts up!</i>

59:11.216 --> 59:12.966
All butts up! Go!

59:17.180 --> 59:20.310
I might do the bridge walk
and then I'm gonna come home.

59:21.267 --> 59:23.137
It's a barely
used refrigerator.

59:29.484 --> 59:31.244
"Old people shit?"

59:38.826 --> 59:41.496
"Kappa Nu
steals from you."

59:41.663 --> 59:42.963
They robbed us?

59:43.039 --> 59:44.289
This is so fucked!

59:44.332 --> 59:46.502
We should call the police!
We can't call the police!

59:46.584 --> 59:48.424
We stole their weed.
We're in too deep!

59:48.586 --> 59:50.506
You know what?
Girls are worse than guys!

59:50.713 --> 59:51.803
I'm just gonna say it!

59:51.923 --> 59:53.843
I know that's not feminist,
but fuck that!

59:53.925 --> 59:55.402
At least they didn't
take Stella's toys.

59:55.426 --> 59:56.487
Oh, don't
give me that!

59:56.511 --> 59:59.101
I've been awake for four days.
I'm so tired!

59:59.847 --> 01:00:02.227
It's 3:00 a.m.
where I am in Australia!

01:00:02.475 --> 01:00:04.635
We are so fucked!

01:00:04.727 --> 01:00:06.347
We're in a drug
war with teenagers.

01:00:06.479 --> 01:00:08.540
We don't have any furniture.
We're gonna go bankrupt.

01:00:08.564 --> 01:00:11.194
We made so many bad choices
throughout this process.

01:00:11.276 --> 01:00:13.356
We're about to have two girls!
Two kids!

01:00:13.528 --> 01:00:15.839
That's completely irresponsible of us.
We can't take care of one.

01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:17.203
I know I'm not
a good parent.

01:00:17.365 --> 01:00:18.685
Oh, fuck that.
I'm the bad parent.

01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:20.661
Now, shut it down.
No. You don't get this one!

01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:22.753
I'm the bad parent!
I'm the bad parent.

01:00:23.037 --> 01:00:25.667
Last week, I found her
chewing on a nugget of weed.

01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:27.309
I don't know how long she
had it in her mouth for.

01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:28.633
Was it the Indica
or Sativa?

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:31.050
It was Indica! She slept for,
like, nine hours after.

01:00:31.254 --> 01:00:32.464
I'm the bad parent.

01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:33.877
When she was
six months old,

01:00:33.965 --> 01:00:35.165
I dropped her
on her head.

01:00:35.258 --> 01:00:37.218
So did I.
What?

01:00:37.302 --> 01:00:39.762
One time, I went to Taco Bell,
I left her at home.

01:00:39.846 --> 01:00:41.176
I forgot she existed.

01:00:41.264 --> 01:00:42.366
She almost died
over a Gordita.

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:43.890
I'm such a bad parent.

01:00:44.058 --> 01:00:45.558
Well, maybe we're
both bad parents!

01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:52.899
Oh, no.

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:54.571
It's Wendy,
the realtor.

01:00:55.028 --> 01:00:57.028
My clients are
backing out of escrow.

01:00:57.405 --> 01:00:58.405
Yeah.
What?

01:00:58.573 --> 01:01:00.703
We drove by the house
yesterday and saw Kappa Nu.

01:01:00.867 --> 01:01:02.219
How do you know
the name of the sorority?

01:01:02.243 --> 01:01:03.583
I went to college,
too, you know.

01:01:03.745 --> 01:01:05.865
Omega Theta.
Let's roll out!

01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:07.169
Why the hell
is he here?

01:01:07.248 --> 01:01:08.668
I thought you
were my clients.

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.920
We hired him because you
just forgot to mention

01:01:11.002 --> 01:01:13.922
the sorority that lives
next to our new house, so that's why.

01:01:14.005 --> 01:01:16.085
Okay. Well, congratulations
because you hired a joke.

01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:17.551
Oh, shove it, Wendy.

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:18.902
Oh, shove it right
back at ya, Oliver!

01:01:18.926 --> 01:01:21.096
Why don't you shove it?
Shove it right back at ya!

01:01:21.179 --> 01:01:22.759
We fucked once.

01:01:22.972 --> 01:01:24.102
Not applicable.

01:01:24.182 --> 01:01:25.892
I just feel like
we're escrowing apart

01:01:26.017 --> 01:01:27.687
and we should be
escrowing together.

01:01:27.769 --> 01:01:29.538
Exactly, guys. Can we just escrow
together for a minute?

01:01:29.562 --> 01:01:31.082
And the truth is,
they're lovely girls.

01:01:31.189 --> 01:01:33.359
Lovely girls. Super nice girls.
We promise you.

01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:34.481
I don't think
that they are

01:01:34.567 --> 01:01:36.777
because we literally saw
them robbing your house.

01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:39.031
Well, thanks for
fucking stopping them!

01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:40.924
You just stood there while
they robbed our house?

01:01:40.948 --> 01:01:42.118
It wasn't like that.

01:01:42.367 --> 01:01:44.617
You didn't tell us
about the sorority!

01:01:44.786 --> 01:01:47.206
Is there anything we can do?
We're desperate!

01:01:47.455 --> 01:01:50.059
Yeah, you can magically make the
sorority that lives next door to you

01:01:50.083 --> 01:01:51.133
disappear by tomorrow.

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:54.711
Is it real?

01:01:54.796 --> 01:01:57.216
No! Maybe it's just the old
people messing with us.

01:01:57.382 --> 01:01:59.318
No. It's a real eviction notice.
I called the landlord.

01:01:59.342 --> 01:02:00.778
Okay, maybe the landlord
was just one of

01:02:00.802 --> 01:02:02.562
the old people pretending
to be the landlord.

01:02:02.595 --> 01:02:04.135
No. We're actually
being evicted, okay?

01:02:04.222 --> 01:02:05.772
We have no
money to pay for it,

01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:07.768
because we spent all of
our money on the weed.

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:10.440
So now we need
five buckets of money

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.770
otherwise, we're gonna
get kicked out tomorrow.

01:02:13.147 --> 01:02:15.000
We're gonna lose the house.
We're gonna lose the house?

01:02:15.024 --> 01:02:17.753
We're gonna lose our sisters,
'cause we're gonna be put in separate dorms.

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:18.962
Then we're gonna
have no friends anymore,

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:21.156
and it's gonna be just like
high school all over again.

01:02:21.364 --> 01:02:23.425
What are we gonna do?
I mean, how do frats make money?

01:02:23.449 --> 01:02:25.539
They throw parties and
they charge for them.

01:02:25.701 --> 01:02:27.741
But no one's gonna pay money
to come to our parties.

01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:29.848
Yeah, it's not like a frat
bro is gonna walk up and be like,

01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:31.592
"Ooh, you look good
in your normal clothes."

01:02:31.666 --> 01:02:32.786
Wait!

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:33.955
"I love your sweater!"

01:02:34.043 --> 01:02:35.213
Girls, I have an idea.

01:02:35.503 --> 01:02:36.503
Okay.

01:02:37.046 --> 01:02:38.836
You're not going
to like it though.

01:02:39.298 --> 01:02:40.468
We have to throw a party.

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:42.550
No. When we throw
parties we lose money.

01:02:42.635 --> 01:02:44.505
No, not one of our
really fun parties

01:02:44.637 --> 01:02:46.427
that we actually
have a good time at.

01:02:46.514 --> 01:02:47.854
I mean it's,
like, empowering.

01:02:48.015 --> 01:02:49.993
We have to throw a really
shitty frat brother party.

01:02:50.017 --> 01:02:51.767
One where the frat
brothers like it so much,

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:53.654
they actually
pay us to come to.

01:02:53.729 --> 01:02:55.165
And then they really
like it so much, they tell

01:02:55.189 --> 01:02:57.569
all their other
douchy frat brother friends

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:58.900
and they all pay us, too.

01:02:58.985 --> 01:03:00.315
Like the one we
met each other at?

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:02.320
The other option here
is losing the house,

01:03:02.447 --> 01:03:04.157
and if we lose the house
we lose Kappa Nu.

01:03:04.365 --> 01:03:06.155
I'm not gonna lose you guys.

01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:07.786
- Okay.
- All right.

01:03:07.869 --> 01:03:09.329
- Let's go tell the girls.
- Okay.

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:10.955
We don't want to
lose this sorority.

01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:12.958
We don't want to
lose our house, okay?

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.710
That's why we gotta

01:03:15.585 --> 01:03:18.335
dress a little
"hotter than we usually do."

01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:19.514
I'm hot!

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:20.879
I fucked the pizza man.

01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:23.048
I gave him five stars
on Yelp.

01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:24.427
You have chips
in your hair.

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:26.470
Yeah.

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:46.758
Look at the production
value on this video.

01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:49.912
We are totally fucked!
We're gonna be bankrupt!

01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:51.907
No, no, no!
Look closer.

01:03:52.079 --> 01:03:53.159
They've lost their way.

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:55.537
They've become everything
that they've hated.

01:03:56.542 --> 01:03:58.672
- Jesus Christ.
- They're vulnerable.

01:03:58.753 --> 01:04:01.343
They're relying fully on this
party to support this house.

01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:02.422
He's right.

01:04:02.465 --> 01:04:04.625
If we shut down this party,
the sorority will dissolve.

01:04:04.759 --> 01:04:06.153
It's time to show
them who's adults,

01:04:06.177 --> 01:04:07.427
and spank their
little bottoms.

01:04:07.595 --> 01:04:08.675
I wanna spank them all.

01:04:08.763 --> 01:04:10.773
Let's do what parents
do better than anything,

01:04:10.932 --> 01:04:14.562
stop young people
from having fun!

01:04:20.983 --> 01:04:22.943
Come on
in, guys!

01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:27.914
Hey, hope you let yourself
in this party later on.

01:04:29.992 --> 01:04:31.332
You're funny.

01:04:32.495 --> 01:04:34.245
Call your friends, okay?
Tell them to come.

01:04:34.413 --> 01:04:35.623
And bring money!

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.960
We shut this motherfucker
down at all costs.

01:04:39.126 --> 01:04:41.496
Y'all go in,
shut it down from the inside.

01:04:41.671 --> 01:04:43.261
Me and Kelly stay,
call the cops

01:04:43.339 --> 01:04:44.839
shut it down
from the outside.

01:04:44.966 --> 01:04:46.966
Inside, outside.
Got it.

01:04:54.183 --> 01:04:55.523
Now I'm ready.

01:04:56.686 --> 01:04:58.556
Now, I'm ready.

01:04:58.646 --> 01:05:00.476
Jesus Christ, man.
Ow!

01:05:07.363 --> 01:05:08.493
Hey!
Hey.

01:05:08.656 --> 01:05:09.946
What's going on,
Kappa Nu?

01:05:10.116 --> 01:05:12.010
Bro, it's only 20 bucks.
You've gotta get down here now.

01:05:12.034 --> 01:05:14.834
They're gonna get wet everywhere,
I swear to God!

01:05:14.996 --> 01:05:17.536
There's so many fucking hot bitches here,
it's ridiculous.

01:05:17.623 --> 01:05:20.173
It's like a hot
bitch fiesta.

01:05:20.334 --> 01:05:22.134
They're, like,
all ripe and ready to pop!

01:05:22.211 --> 01:05:24.841
How much money have we made?
How many money buckets do we have?

01:05:26.382 --> 01:05:27.722
This punch
tastes kind of funny.

01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:29.473
We didn't put
out any punch.

01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:30.675
Oh, no.

01:05:30.845 --> 01:05:31.989
I'm gonna start
phase two, okay?

01:05:32.013 --> 01:05:33.973
Phase two, is we have
to stop the old people

01:05:34.056 --> 01:05:36.056
from calling
the cops, okay?

01:05:36.225 --> 01:05:38.055
If you see any old people in
here, stop them!

01:05:39.186 --> 01:05:40.726
I don't like this.
Me neither.

01:05:40.896 --> 01:05:42.686
No! Stop drinking that.

01:05:42.857 --> 01:05:44.817
Ha! My tongue is numb.

01:05:45.151 --> 01:05:46.151
Just blend in.

01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:48.323
Yes, blend,
blend, blend.

01:05:48.404 --> 01:05:49.964
Oh, <i>excusez-moi.</i>

01:05:53.409 --> 01:05:55.909
It's a good party.
I am gonna text my friends.

01:05:56.078 --> 01:05:57.618
No, it's all a lie.
It's a deception.

01:05:57.747 --> 01:05:59.327
They don't think
you're funny, okay?

01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:01.328
What?
Oh, fuck me!

01:06:01.542 --> 01:06:03.382
Oh, you okay?
What's wrong?

01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:05.714
I shouldn't have
eaten that McRib.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.880
It's no big deal.

01:06:07.048 --> 01:06:09.526
I'm just having the worst cramps in
my life every five, six minutes.

01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:11.340
Yeah, I think you're
going into labor.

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.390
No, no, no. The baby's
not due till tomorrow.

01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:14.892
You're definitely
going into labor.

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:16.182
You need to
be timing this.

01:06:17.266 --> 01:06:18.766
Oh, it's passed.
I feel great.

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:20.037
I told you,
she's not going into labor.

01:06:20.061 --> 01:06:21.061
She's all good, dude.

01:06:21.145 --> 01:06:23.225
Whoo!
There she goes.

01:06:23.397 --> 01:06:25.107
You should
really go after her.

01:06:25.274 --> 01:06:27.404
She's the boss of her
own body, all right?

01:06:27.568 --> 01:06:28.778
The last night of freedom!

01:06:28.944 --> 01:06:30.074
I love you!

01:06:30.196 --> 01:06:31.276
I love you, bubba!

01:06:31.405 --> 01:06:33.865
We have to get upstairs.
That's where the power source is.

01:06:34.075 --> 01:06:35.515
What are you doing?
Don't drink that!

01:06:36.035 --> 01:06:37.035
What's wrong?

01:06:37.078 --> 01:06:39.118
Come on, dude!
Never drink the punch!

01:06:39.413 --> 01:06:40.583
Oh. Whoo!
Let's go.

01:06:51.801 --> 01:06:53.551
I saw you
with Teddy.

01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:55.179
Why were you
with Teddy?

01:06:55.554 --> 01:06:56.564
Shh.

01:06:56.639 --> 01:07:00.429
We're gonna kill the power and
shut down the party.

01:07:01.602 --> 01:07:02.942
What?

01:07:03.604 --> 01:07:06.774
I got real
fucked up really quickly just now.

01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:08.441
Me, too.

01:07:08.609 --> 01:07:10.319
But all I had
was the punch.

01:07:10.611 --> 01:07:12.531
Shit! We got Cosby'd!

01:07:17.618 --> 01:07:18.618
Yes!

01:07:23.165 --> 01:07:24.785
Kappa Nu,

01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:26.841
good night to you.

01:07:36.929 --> 01:07:39.469
They must have an alternate
power source.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.270
Banana! Banana! Banana!

01:07:44.437 --> 01:07:45.977
Must stop you!

01:07:49.942 --> 01:07:51.822
Oh, my God.
Look how big my tongue is.

01:07:52.361 --> 01:07:53.801
Look
how big my tongue is.

01:07:56.198 --> 01:07:57.198
Ew!

01:07:57.324 --> 01:07:59.204
Shit! Fuck!

01:07:59.368 --> 01:08:01.368
Party's big enough,
let's call the cops. Okay.

01:08:01.537 --> 01:08:02.537
Hey, sweet tart!

01:08:02.705 --> 01:08:05.205
It's a little hard to call the
cops without a phone, ain't it?

01:08:05.374 --> 01:08:07.004
Give us that back!
No!

01:08:07.168 --> 01:08:08.288
Drop it!

01:08:08.461 --> 01:08:10.131
Whoa. Ah!
Ooh.

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:11.514
What the fuck?

01:08:11.672 --> 01:08:13.012
Called a cord, dumbass!

01:08:13.174 --> 01:08:14.804
Fucking old people phone!

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:19.135
What the hell?

01:08:19.305 --> 01:08:20.425
Where are our phones?

01:08:20.514 --> 01:08:21.514
Oh, what, these?

01:08:21.557 --> 01:08:23.227
How'd you get those?

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.515
Come on.

01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:29.666
Yo! I couldn't find
the power source.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.439
Shelby took our phones.
Do you have a phone?

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.484
No, I don't have a phone.
I ran out of data.

01:08:33.652 --> 01:08:34.702
Shit!

01:08:34.862 --> 01:08:36.006
- I'm in here, guys.
- Garage.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:37.620
Don't try and
find me though.

01:08:40.075 --> 01:08:42.615
Oh, you're getting warmer.
Getting warmer.

01:08:42.703 --> 01:08:44.212
You're definitely
getting warmer.

01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:45.711
Ooh, ooh.
You're getting warmer.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:46.962
<i>Getting warmer.</i>

01:08:47.041 --> 01:08:48.131
<i>Bingo.</i>

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:50.250
Shit!

01:08:50.336 --> 01:08:51.546
No!

01:08:51.712 --> 01:08:54.191
I'm not gonna let you out until we're
done raising money, all right?

01:08:54.215 --> 01:08:55.755
There's energy
bars in the corner.

01:08:56.008 --> 01:08:58.069
There's some water,
and there's a poo bucket if you need it.

01:08:58.093 --> 01:08:59.093
Shit!

01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:00.888
You come back here,
young lady!

01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:02.425
Kelly! Help us!
Shelby!

01:09:02.598 --> 01:09:03.848
Come back here!

01:09:04.558 --> 01:09:06.728
Come back here right now.

01:09:06.894 --> 01:09:08.904
It's locked. She locked it.

01:09:09.063 --> 01:09:11.403
Okay. Calm down,
let me think.

01:09:12.274 --> 01:09:13.904
All right
here's the plan.

01:09:14.068 --> 01:09:16.448
We're gonna throw everything
we can at this door.

01:09:16.612 --> 01:09:18.032
What are you doing?

01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:19.557
I'm pooing!
When I'm nervous I poo!

01:09:19.698 --> 01:09:20.698
Look away.

01:09:20.866 --> 01:09:23.906
Suck it back up.
We gotta get out of here.

01:09:24.078 --> 01:09:25.247
Yo, get out
of the way.

01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:26.462
Big man!

01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:30.171
Come on!

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:33.962
Ooh.
Shit!

01:09:34.129 --> 01:09:37.419
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:40.013
Let's try something else.

01:09:40.094 --> 01:09:41.224
I'm fine.

01:09:45.933 --> 01:09:47.813
Oh, shit! Mac, you okay?

01:09:47.893 --> 01:09:48.893
I'm good.

01:09:53.691 --> 01:09:54.691
Ooh.

01:09:54.817 --> 01:09:56.237
You broke my bike.

01:09:56.318 --> 01:09:57.648
That didn't work.

01:09:57.778 --> 01:09:59.108
No! Do you got
another one in you?

01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:00.451
I think...

01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:06.624
That's it.

01:10:07.496 --> 01:10:08.956
That's our way out.

01:10:10.624 --> 01:10:11.754
That's way too high up.

01:10:11.876 --> 01:10:12.916
No, it's not.

01:10:13.002 --> 01:10:14.752
What are you gonna do?

01:10:15.129 --> 01:10:16.731
I don't have the keys.
Can you hot-wire it?

01:10:16.755 --> 01:10:17.915
We can drive
through the wall.

01:10:18.132 --> 01:10:19.412
No, I don't know
how to hot-wire.

01:10:19.466 --> 01:10:21.636
But I do know
a thing or two about

01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:24.011
airbags.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.640
Set it down really soft.

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:34.937
Okay.

01:10:35.274 --> 01:10:37.654
Now if we do
this correctly,

01:10:37.818 --> 01:10:41.488
the force from that airbag should
blast us straight through that vent.

01:10:42.031 --> 01:10:44.491
Okay. Who's gonna do it?

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:46.658
I'm gonna do it.
Thank God.

01:10:46.827 --> 01:10:48.287
I don't think
I could do this.

01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:51.248
You okay, man?

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.880
Are we gonna still
hang out after this?

01:10:54.043 --> 01:10:56.003
Are you gonna
wanna hang out with me?

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.500
Yeah.

01:10:57.671 --> 01:11:00.221
And like even though,
like, the war is over,

01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:03.392
I wanna, sort of,
be of value, you know, to you?

01:11:04.303 --> 01:11:05.513
Yeah.

01:11:07.473 --> 01:11:08.723
Prove it.

01:11:09.016 --> 01:11:10.346
Prove what?

01:11:11.393 --> 01:11:12.483
Hug me.

01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:15.359
I'm good.

01:11:15.731 --> 01:11:17.021
Give me a hug.

01:11:17.191 --> 01:11:18.691
Give me a real hug.

01:11:18.859 --> 01:11:20.239
What does that do?

01:11:20.402 --> 01:11:22.402
It solidifies
the bond, bro.

01:11:24.198 --> 01:11:25.368
Bring it in.

01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:31.042
I appreciate you man.
Thank you.

01:11:32.206 --> 01:11:34.036
This is actually
really nice.

01:11:36.669 --> 01:11:39.169
Oh, man.
This just feels good.

01:11:39.588 --> 01:11:41.378
Yeah, I like that.
Boom! Yeah!

01:11:41.548 --> 01:11:43.718
That's it.
Powerful. Power. Yeah!

01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:46.298
Yeah!

01:11:46.512 --> 01:11:47.682
Yeah!

01:11:47.763 --> 01:11:49.433
All right,
that's a little much.

01:11:49.598 --> 01:11:50.848
Thanks, buddy!

01:11:51.016 --> 01:11:53.226
Oh, dude. I like this
broing down shit.

01:11:53.394 --> 01:11:55.194
Dude, we are bros, okay?
Yes.

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:57.064
Let's do this man!
All right.

01:11:57.231 --> 01:11:58.521
Okay, before
you do this,

01:11:58.691 --> 01:12:01.691
maybe just make 100% sure that...

01:12:01.777 --> 01:12:03.277
...you're all
lined up.

01:12:03.445 --> 01:12:04.565
Get ready?

01:12:04.697 --> 01:12:07.827
One! Two!
And three! Two! Three!

01:12:08.993 --> 01:12:10.543
Oh, God!

01:12:10.786 --> 01:12:12.786
Oh, no!
Are you okay?

01:12:13.038 --> 01:12:14.708
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:12:14.873 --> 01:12:16.213
I'm fine. I got this.

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:17.705
No, you don't
got this at all.

01:12:17.793 --> 01:12:19.423
You for sure have
a concussion, man.

01:12:19.586 --> 01:12:22.126
I'm okay. I just need 10 minutes.
Dude.

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:23.579
No! I'm gonna
take it from here.

01:12:28.929 --> 01:12:30.349
Be careful.

01:12:31.807 --> 01:12:32.807
Okay.

01:12:33.934 --> 01:12:35.274
It's time.

01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:45.951
Time
to save my family.

01:12:50.993 --> 01:12:52.123
Are you okay?

01:12:52.286 --> 01:12:53.406
It worked!

01:12:55.414 --> 01:12:56.624
Oh, God.

01:12:58.959 --> 01:12:59.959
Whoo.

01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:01.835
Hey, girls!
Guess what?

01:13:02.004 --> 01:13:03.594
I got rid of
the old people.

01:13:03.756 --> 01:13:05.626
They're trapped in
the garage. We're fine.

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:06.799
What is that?

01:13:06.967 --> 01:13:08.247
Boob! Boob! Boob!

01:13:12.639 --> 01:13:13.639
This party sucks.

01:13:14.266 --> 01:13:15.926
I can't be
here anymore.

01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:17.351
Guys, guys.
We're good.

01:13:17.436 --> 01:13:18.476
Are we though?

01:13:18.645 --> 01:13:19.975
Wet T-shirt contest!

01:13:21.315 --> 01:13:22.475
No! Stop!

01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:24.169
You're all winners.
You're all winners.

01:13:24.318 --> 01:13:25.488
Yeah, baby!

01:13:25.694 --> 01:13:27.154
I think I'm quitting.

01:13:27.321 --> 01:13:28.321
Yeah, I'm quitting, too.

01:13:28.489 --> 01:13:29.489
I'm out.

01:13:29.615 --> 01:13:31.485
No! You all can't quit.
We'll figure it out!

01:13:31.658 --> 01:13:32.788
Wait!

01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:35.550
Wait! Girls, let's
just talk about this for a second. Okay?

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.039
Stop it! Slow down!

01:13:37.206 --> 01:13:38.326
Hold up! Stop!

01:13:38.499 --> 01:13:40.879
Just stop moving!
Okay? Look...

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:43.878
Oh, God.
The party's even bigger.

01:13:46.548 --> 01:13:48.008
What the fuck?
What happened?

01:13:48.175 --> 01:13:49.545
I've been roofied,
so if anyone's

01:13:49.635 --> 01:13:51.175
ever wanted to
have sex with me,

01:13:51.261 --> 01:13:52.431
tonight's the night.

01:13:52.513 --> 01:13:53.865
The plan is
almost done, okay?

01:13:53.889 --> 01:13:56.479
I got the old people away.
Everything's fine.

01:13:56.558 --> 01:13:57.638
We're Kappa Nu.

01:13:57.726 --> 01:14:00.436
This isn't Kappa Nu.
This is not what we set out for.

01:14:00.521 --> 01:14:02.481
That's what? That's it?
You're gonna quit?

01:14:02.564 --> 01:14:04.534
Oh, come on. Don't blame us.
You ruined this.

01:14:04.608 --> 01:14:06.108
I look like Nicki Minaj!

01:14:06.193 --> 01:14:07.613
I look like Snooki.

01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:10.364
I was the only one trying to save this.
This was all my idea.

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:12.567
You're literally
running away to quit.

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:13.939
Whole fucking
thing's imploding.

01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:16.372
So we're gonna
destroy their friendship?

01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:18.155
No, we're just...

01:14:18.247 --> 01:14:19.457
We got escrows, dude.

01:14:20.207 --> 01:14:23.337
We tried. We tried our asses off.
This is not gonna work.

01:14:23.418 --> 01:14:26.708
The whole system is against us
and that's all there is to it.

01:14:26.797 --> 01:14:28.967
All right. I give up.

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:32.386
We live in a sexist world and there
is nothing we can do about it.

01:14:32.469 --> 01:14:34.049
I can't believe
this is actually over.

01:14:34.429 --> 01:14:35.889
And now I'm gonna
lose all my friends

01:14:36.014 --> 01:14:37.534
and it's gonna be just
like I was in high school.

01:14:37.558 --> 01:14:38.888
I just wish we
had never started

01:14:38.976 --> 01:14:40.726
this stupid sorority
in the first place.

01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:41.941
I don't like this.

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.270
They shouldn't
be saying that.

01:14:43.355 --> 01:14:44.565
They're just kids.

01:14:45.357 --> 01:14:46.357
No, it's over.

01:14:47.067 --> 01:14:48.397
No, it's done.

01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:50.899
Hey, hey,
hey! Ladies!

01:14:52.573 --> 01:14:53.663
Get your
shit together!

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.080
What's with
the meltdown?

01:14:55.659 --> 01:14:58.789
You're strong, powerful women and
you're trying to buck the system.

01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:01.751
You're just away from home for the
first time and you're scared.

01:15:01.832 --> 01:15:03.002
I am scared.

01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:04.213
You got this.

01:15:04.293 --> 01:15:06.271
You know what the right thing to do is.
You know what's right.

01:15:06.295 --> 01:15:07.438
We know the right
decision to make.

01:15:07.462 --> 01:15:08.512
We know it.

01:15:08.589 --> 01:15:09.909
What's the right
decision to make?

01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:11.760
Don't give up
on yourselves.

01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:13.215
Give us a little more.

01:15:13.302 --> 01:15:14.737
You get knocked down,
you get up again.

01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:16.761
They're never
gonna keep you down.

01:15:16.972 --> 01:15:18.972
Did you just make that up?
I did.

01:15:19.057 --> 01:15:20.477
Kelly.

01:15:20.684 --> 01:15:22.644
Tell them to make
out with each other.

01:15:23.729 --> 01:15:26.319
Tell them the house isn't Kappa Nu,
they are.

01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:29.438
This house isn't your sorority,
you are!

01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:31.150
No, the mom is right.

01:15:31.361 --> 01:15:32.589
Why are we doing
this right now?

01:15:32.613 --> 01:15:34.174
Why don't we just throw
the party we wanna throw

01:15:34.198 --> 01:15:35.925
and worry about what's
gonna happen tomorrow?

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:37.489
It doesn't matter
if we lose that.

01:15:37.576 --> 01:15:40.406
It matters
if we lose this.

01:15:47.169 --> 01:15:49.419
- You guys.
- I'm so happy.

01:15:51.465 --> 01:15:52.465
Ooh...

01:15:52.549 --> 01:15:53.799
Sisters' hug!

01:15:53.884 --> 01:15:56.474
I wanna
see them kiss so fucking bad.

01:15:56.929 --> 01:15:59.282
All right, let's kick all these
douchebags out of our house.

01:15:59.306 --> 01:16:01.556
Good speech, sweetie!
Thanks, baby.

01:16:01.642 --> 01:16:02.682
Where did that come from?

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:03.849
We have a daughter, baby.

01:16:03.936 --> 01:16:05.121
What happens with
our escrows now?

01:16:05.145 --> 01:16:07.373
I don't know, but I
think it's the best possible outcome.

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:08.397
Okay.

01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:11.990
Jimmy! Jimmy!
Where are you?

01:16:12.236 --> 01:16:13.606
Oh, fuck! Paula.

01:16:17.407 --> 01:16:20.287
Guys, I think
I was wrong.

01:16:20.452 --> 01:16:21.752
It's not the McRib.

01:16:22.663 --> 01:16:24.253
No!
Oh, my God!

01:16:24.331 --> 01:16:25.581
Oh, God!

01:16:25.666 --> 01:16:27.246
It's got my foot!

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:29.377
Ugh!
It's a breech! It's a breech!

01:16:30.003 --> 01:16:31.003
Go to the hospital!

01:16:31.046 --> 01:16:32.206
Go to the hospital!

01:16:32.422 --> 01:16:34.342
I love you.
I love you!

01:17:04.663 --> 01:17:06.043
Are we gonna lose
our house?

01:17:06.206 --> 01:17:08.666
I mean we have no money,
so we're definitely losing it. Yeah.

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:10.880
Well, we better
blow it out!

01:17:13.297 --> 01:17:16.127
Guys, this party is
amazing. You did it.

01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:19.426
The first sorority that can party.
We'd all love to join.

01:17:19.511 --> 01:17:20.551
Who's "we"?

01:17:26.393 --> 01:17:29.733
Uh, drop your dues in the
bucket if you wanna join.

01:17:29.896 --> 01:17:31.146
Do we have
to wear hoodies?

01:17:31.315 --> 01:17:33.725
I mean, no offense to you guys,
but I like to dress pretty.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.570
No, dude. You can totally
wear whatever you want.

01:17:36.945 --> 01:17:38.485
Welcome to Kappa Nu.

01:17:38.572 --> 01:17:39.912
Welcome, you guys!

01:17:43.452 --> 01:17:44.662
Oh, my God!

01:17:44.745 --> 01:17:45.745
Come in.

01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:48.672
Money in the bucket.
Just some money in the bucket.

01:17:48.749 --> 01:17:50.459
Yeah, just throw it
in the bucket.

01:18:03.847 --> 01:18:04.847
Hey, Pete.

01:18:04.931 --> 01:18:06.061
Pete.

01:18:06.224 --> 01:18:07.734
Pete, wake up, man.

01:18:08.268 --> 01:18:09.268
Pete.

01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:10.846
Dude, what the fuck?

01:18:10.937 --> 01:18:12.267
What are you doing?

01:18:12.439 --> 01:18:14.189
Just calm down.
Just listen.

01:18:14.358 --> 01:18:16.108
I'm sorry, okay?

01:18:16.276 --> 01:18:17.936
I'm sorry.

01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:19.201
When you two
got engaged,

01:18:19.279 --> 01:18:20.909
I was in a bad place

01:18:21.073 --> 01:18:23.283
and I thought I was
losing my best friend.

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:26.330
Then I realized I'm
never gonna lose you

01:18:27.079 --> 01:18:28.829
because we're brothers.

01:18:29.581 --> 01:18:30.791
Forever.

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:33.041
Right?
For life.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.750
I'm not losing
a best friend,

01:18:35.837 --> 01:18:37.957
I'm gaining a best
friend's husband.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.430
Motherfucker!

01:18:41.468 --> 01:18:44.138
Hey, hey, hey!
It's okay. It's all right.

01:18:44.304 --> 01:18:45.504
Teddy and I are
just making up.

01:18:45.555 --> 01:18:46.635
Okay.

01:18:49.810 --> 01:18:51.650
Um, can I ask
you something?

01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:53.269
Yeah, man.

01:18:55.399 --> 01:18:59.319
Would you maybe
wanna be my best man?

01:19:00.737 --> 01:19:02.447
Holy shit. Really?
Yeah.

01:19:02.614 --> 01:19:03.800
Yes, I'll be your
best man, dude.

01:19:03.824 --> 01:19:05.994
I love you.
Love you, dude.

01:19:06.159 --> 01:19:07.489
You, too!

01:19:07.661 --> 01:19:09.961
- Come over here.
- Get over here!

01:19:10.122 --> 01:19:12.082
I have two brothers now.

01:19:20.674 --> 01:19:23.014
I see your shitty
be-yourself party

01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:25.796
is even more popular than
your fucking sell-out party.

01:19:25.971 --> 01:19:26.971
So, that's fantastic.

01:19:27.097 --> 01:19:29.677
Actually, it's really
good for you

01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:33.480
because we are prepared to give
back to you for helping us

01:19:33.687 --> 01:19:36.357
with your escrowdom.

01:19:36.857 --> 01:19:38.857
We've made
a shit ton of money,

01:19:38.984 --> 01:19:40.994
eight buckets,
actually, full of money,

01:19:41.153 --> 01:19:42.863
and we have way too
many people wanting

01:19:42.988 --> 01:19:44.668
to join our sorority
than we have room for.

01:19:44.823 --> 01:19:46.863
Yeah, we can actually afford
to fill two houses now.

01:19:47.033 --> 01:19:49.953
Can we rent your
house for overflow?

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.710
- Yeah.
- Just an idea.

01:19:52.873 --> 01:19:57.543
We are prepared to offer you four
buckets of money per month in rent.

01:19:57.627 --> 01:19:58.627
Five.

01:19:59.713 --> 01:20:01.473
Five. We'll do it
for five buckets.

01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:03.381
Per month.
Five buckets per month.

01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:05.010
Five buckets it is.

01:20:05.177 --> 01:20:08.137
Fuck, yes!
Eat shit! We win!

01:20:08.722 --> 01:20:09.762
Give us more!

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:11.117
You can do this every month?
Yup.

01:20:11.141 --> 01:20:12.141
When can
we move in?

01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:14.435
Right now! Who cares?
Give us the money! Yes!

01:20:14.519 --> 01:20:16.639
We're gonna be landlords!
How hard could it be?

01:20:17.397 --> 01:20:18.727
Fuck it.
Fuck you!

01:20:21.234 --> 01:20:22.244
Thank you!

01:20:22.402 --> 01:20:24.612
Overflow party!

01:20:46.676 --> 01:20:48.086
Oh, man.

01:20:48.386 --> 01:20:50.216
I'm gonna
miss this place.

01:20:50.764 --> 01:20:52.604
Our first house.

01:20:52.766 --> 01:20:54.176
When Stella
was a little baby.

01:20:54.351 --> 01:20:55.351
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:55.519 --> 01:20:56.999
That's where she
took her first steps.

01:20:57.103 --> 01:20:58.403
Yep.

01:20:58.605 --> 01:21:00.045
That's where she
said her first word.

01:21:01.233 --> 01:21:03.533
Those are the little notches
when she was growing taller.

01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:05.033
You see your
little notches?

01:21:05.195 --> 01:21:06.775
Remember those, Stels?

01:21:09.574 --> 01:21:11.374
It's all going
by so fast, huh?

01:21:11.535 --> 01:21:12.785
Yeah, it's crazy.

01:21:12.953 --> 01:21:13.953
Yep.

01:21:14.496 --> 01:21:15.496
Okay.

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:16.920
Let's go.

01:21:17.082 --> 01:21:18.582
Come this way?

01:21:37.227 --> 01:21:38.557
It's our new house!

01:21:38.645 --> 01:21:40.685
You can't even
see the neighbours.

01:21:46.236 --> 01:21:49.066
You know what?
I think we are good parents.

01:21:49.155 --> 01:21:50.905
I mean, we parented Teddy.

01:21:50.991 --> 01:21:53.831
We parented 30
crazy sorority girls.

01:21:54.119 --> 01:21:55.749
Well, we're trying.
Yeah.

01:21:55.829 --> 01:21:57.139
Because that's all
you can do, right?

01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:58.373
I think so.

01:21:58.456 --> 01:22:00.576
The truth is, it doesn't even
matter if we're

01:22:00.667 --> 01:22:02.287
good parents or not,
because one day,

01:22:02.377 --> 01:22:03.837
our daughters are
going to look at us

01:22:04.004 --> 01:22:05.424
just like those
sorority girls do.

01:22:05.505 --> 01:22:07.415
They're not gonna want
anything to do with us.

01:22:07.507 --> 01:22:09.087
They're not gonna
wanna talk to us.

01:22:09.175 --> 01:22:10.255
It breaks my heart.

01:22:10.343 --> 01:22:11.343
Momma.

01:22:13.013 --> 01:22:14.013
Are you scared?

01:22:14.514 --> 01:22:15.604
I'm scared.

01:22:15.682 --> 01:22:16.682
Come on, sweetie.

01:22:19.853 --> 01:22:21.193
Come on,
sweetie.

01:22:22.147 --> 01:22:24.067
Hey, cheeky girl!

01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:25.689
Hey, sweetie.
How are you?

01:22:25.859 --> 01:22:26.961
Do you wanna
go to sleep?

01:22:26.985 --> 01:22:28.129
Do you want
to go to sleep?

01:22:28.153 --> 01:22:29.363
Not yet.

01:22:29.446 --> 01:22:31.736
Not yet? You wanna just hang
out for a little bit more?

01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:34.731
Can you play
Peek-a-boo?

01:22:35.076 --> 01:22:36.076
Peek-a-boo!

01:22:38.538 --> 01:22:39.708
Ooh.

01:22:40.582 --> 01:22:41.832
Peek-a-boo!

01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:43.540
Peek-a-boo!

01:22:44.586 --> 01:22:45.666
Peek-a-boo!

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.920
You'll always be really nice to us,
won't you?

01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:49.358
You'll always be our
best friend, right?

01:22:49.382 --> 01:22:51.182
We'll always have things
to talk about, right?

01:22:51.384 --> 01:22:52.394
Mmm-hmm.

01:23:02.187 --> 01:23:03.477
Hey!
Hey, sweetie!

01:23:03.563 --> 01:23:04.863
Hey, sweetie!

01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:06.233
I'm not sad.

01:23:06.399 --> 01:23:07.609
No, I'm fine.

01:23:08.151 --> 01:23:09.321
I love you, sweetie.

01:23:09.402 --> 01:23:10.612
I love you, sweetie.

01:23:11.071 --> 01:23:12.451
Love you.

01:23:23.249 --> 01:23:24.852
How do you feel? Good?

01:23:24.876 --> 01:23:26.286
Yeah.

01:23:26.378 --> 01:23:28.128
The nerves are kicking
in a little bit.

01:23:28.213 --> 01:23:30.263
Well, you look great.
Thanks!

01:23:30.423 --> 01:23:32.633
You all right?
You seem really nervous.

01:23:32.717 --> 01:23:34.717
I'm having a little
bit of a meltdown.

01:23:34.928 --> 01:23:36.678
Just remember, man,

01:23:38.223 --> 01:23:40.393
Darren loves you more than
anyone in the entire world.

01:23:41.685 --> 01:23:43.595
Darren cherishes his
friendship with you.

01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:47.898
Darren can't imagine
his life without you.

01:23:49.484 --> 01:23:52.534
And Darren is proud
to call you his best friend.

01:23:52.612 --> 01:23:54.242
You're not talking
about Darren, are you?

01:23:54.322 --> 01:23:55.412
No, not really.

01:23:56.282 --> 01:23:57.782
Let's get you
married though, huh?

01:23:59.119 --> 01:24:01.159
All right, everybody.
Look alive, look alive!

01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:05.246
We have Groom One and he is ready
to walk along with his best man.

01:24:05.417 --> 01:24:06.457
You ready for us?

01:24:06.626 --> 01:24:09.086
I'm proud of you, man.
You found your niche.

01:24:09.212 --> 01:24:10.892
This just seemed like
a logical conclusion.

01:24:10.964 --> 01:24:12.054
Gay wedding planning.

01:24:12.132 --> 01:24:14.802
It's a great job, and you can
do it with a criminal record.

01:24:14.884 --> 01:24:16.894
My only skill is
planning parties.

01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:20.520
And, for some reason, gay guys specifically,
they just respond to me.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.430
It's because
you're a great guy.

01:24:22.767 --> 01:24:23.887
Thanks, man.

01:24:23.977 --> 01:24:25.871
And they probably wanna
fuck the shit out of you.

01:24:25.895 --> 01:24:27.725
Hey, I didn't say it.

01:24:27.814 --> 01:24:28.984
You did.

01:24:29.774 --> 01:24:30.864
Delta Psi.

01:24:31.192 --> 01:24:32.652
Delta Psi.

01:24:33.319 --> 01:24:34.949
Let's get you
married, okay?

01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:36.203
Yes. Let's do it.

01:24:36.281 --> 01:24:37.451
And we are walking.

01:24:39.159 --> 01:24:41.239
Hey, guys,
we're home with baby Mildred!

01:24:41.786 --> 01:24:43.706
Welcome home!
How's it going?

01:24:43.788 --> 01:24:44.788
How was
the birth?

01:24:45.039 --> 01:24:47.169
It's over now.
Yes.

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:48.330
Did you shit
on the table?

01:24:48.418 --> 01:24:50.298
No.
Me neither.

01:24:50.378 --> 01:24:51.378
Pro.

01:24:51.463 --> 01:24:53.053
So much shit.

01:24:54.883 --> 01:24:57.013
Aw. You got a present for
your new little sister?

01:24:57.177 --> 01:24:58.797
Baby's first dildo.

01:24:58.887 --> 01:25:00.557
Thank you, Stella.

01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:02.348
Oh, my God.
You guys are just like us.

01:25:03.057 --> 01:25:04.137
Go on,
show them.

01:25:04.225 --> 01:25:06.345
This is
Jimmy Jr.'s favorite.

01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:10.231
We kind of have a "no veins rule"
with our vibrators.

01:25:10.315 --> 01:25:11.876
Maybe get one without a
ball sack attached to it.

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:14.780
Put that away.
Put it away.

01:25:14.986 --> 01:25:18.026
Are you ready to meet your cousin,
Jimmy Jr.?

01:25:18.698 --> 01:25:19.908
Look at her.

01:25:21.034 --> 01:25:23.874
Look at this.
Families are meeting.

01:25:24.913 --> 01:25:26.623
Look at that.
Oh, my God.

01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:28.996
"Hi, Jimmy Jr. I'm Mildred."

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.250
Cute.

01:25:30.543 --> 01:25:33.963
"Hi, Mildred.
One day, we are going to fuck!"

01:25:34.047 --> 01:25:35.691
"No, that's never going to happen

01:25:35.715 --> 01:25:38.085
"because my parents are
gonna teach me to respect myself

01:25:38.176 --> 01:25:39.966
"and stay away
from guys like you."

01:25:40.053 --> 01:25:41.553
I could do this all day.
I could, too.

01:25:41.721 --> 01:25:43.199
We're gonna go.
We're gonna get out of your hair.

01:25:43.223 --> 01:25:45.063
Thank you for watching Stella.
Thank you, guys.

01:25:45.225 --> 01:25:46.515
Oh, my God. Anytime.

01:25:46.601 --> 01:25:47.641
Bye. She's beautiful.

01:25:47.727 --> 01:25:49.477
Thanks, you guys.
Thanks, guys.

01:25:49.896 --> 01:25:51.016
Bye.

01:25:52.065 --> 01:25:53.395
We did it.
We did it.

01:25:53.483 --> 01:25:55.243
We had another kid.
We got another one.

01:25:56.069 --> 01:25:57.399
I love you.
I love you.

01:25:58.655 --> 01:26:01.405
Stella, you wanna
kiss your sister? Hey.
