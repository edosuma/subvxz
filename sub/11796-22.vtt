00:02.535 --> 00:04.237
( bell rings )

00:04.270 --> 00:06.573
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.606 --> 00:09.409
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.442 --> 00:12.345
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.379 --> 00:16.383
<i>* I'm at</i>
<i>the corner just in time</i>
<i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.416 --> 00:22.155
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.188 --> 00:24.691
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.724 --> 00:28.194
<i>* And my dog ate</i>
<i>all my homework last night</i>

00:28.228 --> 00:30.563
<i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
<i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.597 --> 00:34.167
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>it'll be all right</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:38.738
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.786 --> 00:55.889
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:55.922 --> 00:58.625
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:58.658 --> 01:02.128
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved</i>
<i>by the bell *</i>

01:17.811 --> 01:20.680
Not since the Beatles
and the Rolling Stones

01:20.714 --> 01:23.850
has a group so
captured the hearts
and minds of young America.

01:23.883 --> 01:26.753
I'm Casey Kasem here in
the dressing room
with Zack Morris

01:26.786 --> 01:30.223
of the Zack Attack. How does
it feel to be a rock and
roll legend, Zack?

01:30.256 --> 01:32.258
lt sure beats algebra.
( all laugh )

01:32.292 --> 01:35.261
-Zack, Zack!
-No, no. It's okay.

01:35.295 --> 01:37.497
-Zack, please, sign my arm?
-Oh, sure.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.667
I know what it's like to be
a fan. I used to sneak
into Paula Abdul's

01:40.700 --> 01:42.502
dressing room at
least twice a week.

01:42.535 --> 01:45.538
Signing arms, kisses,
it's all part of the fame.

01:45.572 --> 01:48.875
And it's the best part.
Well, come on, let's do it.

01:48.908 --> 01:51.177
Thank you. All right.

01:53.813 --> 01:56.516
( screaming )

01:56.549 --> 01:59.219
They've got people outside
that can't get
into the auditorium

01:59.252 --> 02:02.622
at all because it's jammed.
And there they
are in the hallways.

02:02.655 --> 02:06.526
Here's Lisa Turtle,
bass player. Lisa...

02:06.559 --> 02:09.729
Are you ready?
Here she is, Kelly
Kapowski the lead singer.

02:09.763 --> 02:13.933
AC Slater, he's on drums.
And finally,
we have on keyboards...

02:13.967 --> 02:17.537
-Pope John Paul?
-What are you doing?

02:17.570 --> 02:20.373
I'm disguised,
so the fans won't
recognize me.

02:20.407 --> 02:23.243
-Slater: Screech!
-Shh. It's "Your Holiness."

02:23.276 --> 02:26.780
No. It's Your Dorkiness.
You don't go on
stage in disguise.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.916
-Screech, take off
that ridiculous costume.
-And what if I don't?

02:29.949 --> 02:33.753
You will go right to heaven,
because I will kill you
and make it hurt.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.823
Okay, gang, let's make this
the best concert ever!

02:36.856 --> 02:39.626
-All right, On three.
-One, two, three.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.895
Friends forever!

02:44.731 --> 02:46.866
Let's go do our show!

02:48.902 --> 02:51.838
The Friends Forever
Tour kicks off tonight.

02:51.871 --> 02:56.476
But let's go back to
that California garage
where it all began.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.914
Zack:
<i>Through it all, hanging tough</i>

03:00.947 --> 03:05.385
<i>We'll stay side by side</i>

03:05.418 --> 03:08.722
<i>We'll be friends forever</i>

03:08.755 --> 03:12.459
<i>Till the end of time</i>

03:12.492 --> 03:15.528
<i>Friends forever</i>

03:15.562 --> 03:18.965
-Zack: <i>We'll be friends</i>
-<i>With you everywhere</i>

03:19.065 --> 03:22.969
-<i>Talking about friends</i>
-<i>Friends forever</i>

03:23.069 --> 03:26.740
-<i>They'll always be there</i>
-<i>Always will be there</i>

03:26.773 --> 03:30.810
-<i>Yeah, yeah, friends</i>
-<i>Friends forever</i>

03:30.844 --> 03:34.481
-<i>Always be friends</i>
-<i>With you everywhere</i>

03:34.514 --> 03:38.618
-<i>We'll be friends together</i>
-<i>Friends forever</i>

03:38.651 --> 03:42.622
-<i>Yes we will...yes we will</i>
-<i>Always will be there</i>

03:42.655 --> 03:46.626
Zack and Slater: <i>Whoa-oh</i>

03:47.627 --> 03:49.496
-Slater: Yeah.
-Lisa: That was good!

03:49.529 --> 03:51.698
That was the best song
you ever wrote, Zack.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.767
-Zack: All right.
-Yeah, I like the title.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.536
''Friends
Forever.'' It's pretty cool.

03:56.569 --> 04:00.840
But we haven't known each
other forever. lf we sing that
we'll be living a lie.

04:00.874 --> 04:04.444
As you can see,
Screech was
the same even then.

04:04.477 --> 04:06.046
Screech, we're doing the song.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.415
Why? No one's gonna
want to hear it but us.

04:08.448 --> 04:13.586
Little did they know that fate
was running by their door.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.890
( British accent ) Excuse me.
Hello, I'm Brian Fate.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.459
I heard your song
as I was jogging by.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.494
Brian Fate,
the record producer?

04:21.528 --> 04:22.962
Don't you manage
the Beach Buddies?

04:23.063 --> 04:25.598
That's right. But I'm
looking for a new group.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.934
The Beach Buddies
aren't buddies anymore.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.636
Are you really
interested in us?

04:29.669 --> 04:32.339
Does Bart Simpson
have animated zits?

04:32.372 --> 04:34.607
-Of course I'm interested.
-All right.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.876
Band meeting. Let's huddle.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.813
All: Oh!

04:39.846 --> 04:43.783
Thus began their
dizzying trip to the top.

04:43.817 --> 04:47.587
( soft music playing )

04:50.724 --> 04:55.495
<i>Thought we'd</i>
<i>always be together</i>

04:57.731 --> 05:02.535
<i>I was sure our love would last</i>

05:03.470 --> 05:06.473
<i>Here I am, all alone</i>

05:06.506 --> 05:10.343
<i>Wondering what went wrong</i>

05:10.377 --> 05:14.848
<i>Did we ever have a chance?</i>

05:17.050 --> 05:22.622
<i>It's hard to see</i>
<i>this world without you</i>

05:23.723 --> 05:28.895
<i>A lonely place without romance</i>

05:28.928 --> 05:32.932
<i>Here I am, all alone</i>

05:32.966 --> 05:37.103
<i>Wondering where you've gone</i>

05:37.137 --> 05:41.608
<i>Did we ever have a chance?</i>

05:43.610 --> 05:48.948
<i>What did we</i>
<i>promise to each other?</i>

05:50.550 --> 05:55.622
<i>What were the words we said?</i>

05:55.655 --> 05:59.626
<i>Ooh, looking back to yesterday</i>

05:59.659 --> 06:03.029
Lisa and Slater:
<i>When we started out</i>

06:03.029 --> 06:05.732
<i>Did we ever have a clue</i>

06:05.765 --> 06:10.403
<i>What love was all about?</i>

06:10.437 --> 06:15.575
<i>Thought we'd</i>
<i>always be together</i>

06:17.043 --> 06:22.549
<i>I was sure our love would last</i>

06:22.582 --> 06:26.052
<i>Here I am, all alone</i>

06:26.052 --> 06:30.056
<i>Wondering what went wrong</i>

06:30.056 --> 06:35.195
<i>Did we ever have a chance?</i>

06:35.228 --> 06:37.964
<i>Hi, I'm Mindy Wollitzer,</i>
<i>and I handle publicity</i>

06:38.064 --> 06:40.567
<i>for the hottest new</i>
<i>band on the music scene.</i>

06:40.600 --> 06:43.470
-Wow, what band is that?
-Us.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.071
Us? Who are they?

06:45.071 --> 06:48.775
Us is us.
I wish I had fangs
so I could bite you.

06:48.808 --> 06:51.511
Any bite would be welcome,
my dear.

06:51.544 --> 06:55.215
<i>"Did We Ever Have</i>
<i>A Chance" has sold</i>
<i>over five million copies.</i>

06:55.248 --> 06:59.552
<i>l've invited you all here</i>
<i>today for the band's</i>
<i>first press conference.</i>

06:59.586 --> 07:02.455
-Do you have a girlfriend,
Zack?
-<i>Well, it depends.</i>

07:02.489 --> 07:04.791
<i>Are you asking me for a date?</i>

07:04.824 --> 07:08.495
<i>I think Zack is still</i>
<i>waiting for the right girl</i>
<i>to come along.</i>

07:08.528 --> 07:10.663
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>
<i>But in the meantime</i>

07:10.697 --> 07:13.566
<i>I'm having a blast</i>
<i>with the wrong ones.</i>

07:13.600 --> 07:16.036
Do you guys really
get along offstage?

07:16.069 --> 07:19.839
<i>Oh yes. We're</i>
<i>friends first, and nothing</i>
<i>could ever come between us.</i>

07:19.873 --> 07:22.509
<i>I really sound like</i>
<i>a goody-goody, don't I?</i>

07:22.542 --> 07:24.744
All: Uh-huh!

07:24.778 --> 07:27.914
Lisa, is it true
that you and Screech
are an item?

07:27.947 --> 07:30.784
<i>That is a dirty,</i>
<i>ugly, vicious lie.</i>

07:30.817 --> 07:33.753
<i>They're the best kind of lies.</i>

07:33.787 --> 07:36.222
<i>Zack, since you</i>
<i>write all the songs,</i>
<i>everybody wants to know</i>

07:36.256 --> 07:37.824
<i>where you get</i>
<i>your inspiration?</i>

07:37.857 --> 07:41.695
<i>Girls. I get my best</i>
<i>inspiration from girls.</i>

07:41.728 --> 07:45.565
<i>You know,</i>
<i>in fact, I just got an idea</i>
<i>for a new song.</i>

07:45.598 --> 07:48.068
-What's it called?
-<i>"Mindy, Mindy."</i>

07:48.068 --> 07:52.272
-Ooh.
-<i>Well, that about Zack's up,</i>

07:52.305 --> 07:55.175
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>wraps up our press conference</i>
<i>for today.</i>

07:55.208 --> 07:57.177
<i>I want to thank</i>
<i>you all for coming.</i>

07:58.978 --> 08:00.747
-Brian:
It was a great job, Mindy.
-Thank you.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.049
You had reporters from
all over the country.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.019
-Wasn't she great, Zack?
-Oh, absolutely.
And she's still great.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.722
I think you're
great too, Zack.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.160
You know,
I think you're great, Kelly.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.230
-I think you're
great too, Lisa.
-I think you're all great.

08:17.263 --> 08:20.100
-Do you think I'm great?
-It would be
great if you left.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.534
Great! See ya!

08:21.568 --> 08:25.839
The music industry
turns out once a year
to honor its finest artists.

08:25.872 --> 08:29.142
The Zack Attack was nominated
for the biggest award.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.044
<i>The winner...</i>

08:31.044 --> 08:34.847
<i>The Zack Attack for</i>
<i>"Did We Ever Have A Chance."</i>

08:34.881 --> 08:37.917
( audience applauding )

08:40.153 --> 08:42.756
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>We're all very excited.</i>

08:42.789 --> 08:46.126
<i>Hi, Mom. I love America.</i>
<i>There I go again.</i>

08:46.159 --> 08:50.263
<i>Thank you. l'd just like to</i>
<i>thank my dad for giving me my</i>
<i>first drum set.</i>

08:50.296 --> 08:52.198
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

08:52.232 --> 08:56.302
<i>And l'd like to thank my dad</i>
<i>for giving me electric trains</i>
<i>when I was three.</i>

08:56.336 --> 09:00.840
( crying ) <i>Dad,</i>
<i>that meant so much to me.</i>

09:00.874 --> 09:03.109
<i>l'd like to thank</i>
<i>my mom and my dad,</i>

09:03.143 --> 09:06.212
<i>my grandmother,</i>
<i>my hair stylist</i>
<i>and manicurist,</i>

09:06.246 --> 09:09.015
<i>and l'd like to</i>
<i>ask Michael to wait</i>
<i>backstage for me.</i>

09:09.049 --> 09:11.584
-<i>Thank you.</i>
-<i>We couldn't have</i>
<i>done this alone.</i>

09:11.618 --> 09:13.586
<i>I want to thank our manager,</i>
<i>Brian Fate,</i>

09:13.620 --> 09:16.056
<i>and my favorite publicist,</i>
<i>Mindy Wollitzer,</i>

09:16.089 --> 09:18.625
<i>and everyone for</i>
<i>listening to my music.</i>

09:18.658 --> 09:21.895
<i>I mean our music. Thank you.</i>

09:21.928 --> 09:24.831
( audience applauding )

09:36.476 --> 09:39.546
That was really
nice what you said
about me at the Rock Awards.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.915
Hey, I meant it. You've
helped the group a lot.

09:41.948 --> 09:45.151
I'm more
interested in helping you.

09:46.686 --> 09:50.056
That's my kind of help.

09:56.463 --> 10:00.834
Check this out, Screech.
We have died and
gone to babe heaven.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.804
Yeah. Let's sample
some of the afterlife.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.639
Let's do it.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.112
Hi, girls. We're here.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.215
( gasps ) Look who it is!

10:15.248 --> 10:18.718
All right. One at a time.
There's enough of
me for everybody.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.755
So, AC, how does it
feel to win an award?

10:21.788 --> 10:24.491
About half as
good as it would feel
to win you...

10:24.524 --> 10:27.727
-and you, and you, and you.
-Oh!

10:27.761 --> 10:29.963
So, do you girls
live around here?

10:29.996 --> 10:34.100
Slater, tell us your deepest,
darkest secret.

10:34.134 --> 10:39.172
Tell them about that
contagious blue fungus you
have on your feet.

10:41.207 --> 10:44.744
As I was saying,
do you girls live
around here?

10:46.613 --> 10:50.083
You're probably
really busy, but l'd love
to take you sailing.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.519
-Sailing, I'd love that.
-It's okay.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.954
I shouldn't have
asked someone so famous.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.557
-Yes you should, I want to go.
-It's all right.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.760
-I'll find
someone less beautiful.
-Come back, I like you.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.163
Don't pity me.

11:05.131 --> 11:07.567
What happened here?

11:09.069 --> 11:12.605
Zack!
Zack, you've got to
see these new costumes

11:12.639 --> 11:14.974
l've just designed
for the group. Look.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.277
-Lisa, these are great.
-Look at this one.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.978
-Let me see. Oh!
-Thanks.

11:19.079 --> 11:24.617
They're very cute, Lisa, but
we've already asked Bob Mackie
to design some costumes.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.754
Bob Mackie? Wow,
he designs Cher's outfits.

11:27.787 --> 11:31.658
We're in the big
time now, Lisa.
You understand, don't you?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.194
But, Zack?

11:38.331 --> 11:40.633
Sure.

11:43.169 --> 11:46.172
Mindy, I...I feel bad for her.

11:46.206 --> 11:51.911
Zack, l've gotten you this
far. You stick with me,
you'll be a star.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.913
Me? What about the group?

11:53.947 --> 11:57.117
You don't need them.
They're just backup singers.

12:01.755 --> 12:07.827
As Mindy and Zack
grew closer, the band
and Zack grew further apart.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.196
( angrily ) Where is Zack?
He's over an hour late!

12:10.230 --> 12:12.332
Where do you think he is?

12:12.365 --> 12:14.934
Do you think he was kidnapped
by space creatures?

12:14.968 --> 12:17.170
Same thing
happened to Billy ldol.

12:17.203 --> 12:20.306
Come on, guys. I'm sure Zack
has a perfectly
good explanation.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.842
Yeah, and her name is Mindy.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.746
-...number one. It's another.
-You think so?

12:26.780 --> 12:28.615
-It is.
-Here you go.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.818
Here you go.
Why's everybody
standing around?

12:31.851 --> 12:33.953
Come on, let's do it.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.122
Where did this song come from?

12:36.156 --> 12:38.358
It came from Mindy and me.
We wrote it.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.695
-She can write?
-I suppose you've
got something better.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.830
I don't know if it's better,
but we sure like it.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.265
Kelly, Screech and I wrote it.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.101
I didn't know jocks
could write.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.971
All right, all right.
Let's hear their song.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.007
All right.
You ready, Kelly? Screech?

12:54.107 --> 12:57.110
Here we go. One, two, three...

13:00.146 --> 13:04.250
<i>School is a bore</i>
<i>when we're stuck indoors</i>

13:04.284 --> 13:08.321
<i>Make it fun,</i>
<i>put it out in the sun</i>

13:08.355 --> 13:10.357
<i>Hit the beach, teach</i>

13:10.390 --> 13:15.395
<i>Let us learn while we burn...</i>

13:15.428 --> 13:19.199
-Well, what do you think?
-It's...it's nice.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.668
Do you really like it, Lisa?

13:21.701 --> 13:23.236
Well, it rhymed.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.537
Here's a rhyme.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.841
-We'll sing what's written.
I'm the writer.
-That doesn't rhyme.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.876
Come on, Zack.
Give us a chance.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.644
( all arguing )

13:31.678 --> 13:33.847
People, people!

13:33.880 --> 13:36.850
This studio
costs <i>mucho dinero.</i>

13:36.883 --> 13:41.321
Money!
Now let's do Zack's song now,
and argue later.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.095
All right.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.931
Here we go.
One, two, three, four.

13:51.965 --> 13:55.368
( pop music playing )

14:00.140 --> 14:04.411
<i>Let's stay together</i>
<i>Let's stay together, baby</i>

14:04.444 --> 14:06.680
<i>Let's stay together</i>

14:06.713 --> 14:09.049
<i>Let's stay together, baby</i>

14:09.049 --> 14:12.686
<i>A flash of light comes</i>
<i>flyin' from your eyes</i>

14:12.719 --> 14:15.889
<i>I get the feelin'</i>
<i>that I'm hypnotized</i>

14:15.922 --> 14:17.257
<i>Oh-oh</i>

14:17.290 --> 14:21.094
Slater and Zack:
<i>It feels so good</i>
<i>when you're around</i>

14:21.127 --> 14:25.832
<i>We're moving fast to all those</i>
<i>def groovin' sounds</i>

14:25.865 --> 14:29.169
-<i>Love me now</i>
-<i>Let's stay together, baby</i>

14:29.202 --> 14:31.404
<i>Love me now</i>

14:31.438 --> 14:34.074
<i>Please say</i>
<i>you'll leave me never</i>

14:34.074 --> 14:36.142
<i>Love me now</i>

14:36.176 --> 14:37.977
All right!

14:38.078 --> 14:40.447
Who's been
spreading all these rumors
about us?

14:40.480 --> 14:43.717
They're not rumors, Zack.
Unfortunately, they're true.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.219
( scoffs ) What
happens in the group
should stay in the group.

14:46.252 --> 14:49.189
There is no group.
Not since she came along.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.792
You're wrong.
She is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

14:52.826 --> 14:56.096
-I thought I was.
-Quiet, doofus.

14:56.129 --> 14:59.099
People, we have
a concert in five minutes.
Let's discuss it later.

14:59.132 --> 15:02.302
No, no. Forget later, Brian.
I want to know who
gave this interview.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.804
-I didn't.
-I didn't.

15:04.838 --> 15:09.042
-I didn't.
-( whistling )

15:09.042 --> 15:11.778
Screech,
how could you do this to me?

15:11.811 --> 15:14.381
It was easy.
They gave me a free
pass to Disneyland

15:14.414 --> 15:17.317
and I told them what I knew.
I'm so weak.

15:17.350 --> 15:22.122
Do all of you think
I'm an ego-driven,
self-centered prima donna?

15:22.155 --> 15:25.825
I was misquoted.
They forgot "glory hog." Oops!

15:25.859 --> 15:27.961
ls that what you all think?

15:28.061 --> 15:31.164
-You've changed, Zack.
-She's right.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.933
-Kelly?
-Sorry.

15:33.967 --> 15:37.270
lf that's how you all think,
there's only one thing to do.

15:37.303 --> 15:41.107
-You don't need them, baby.
-You're right. I quit.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.544
-What?
-But Zack, we have a concert.

15:44.577 --> 15:48.448
Let's see how good
you do without me.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.451
-What are we gonna do?
-I think we
can...I'll go get him.

15:54.788 --> 16:00.760
This garage, which gave birth
to so many hopes and dreams,
is empty now.

16:00.794 --> 16:05.265
After the break up,
each member
went their own separate way.

16:09.035 --> 16:12.772
Casey: <i>Screech searched far</i>
<i>and wide for</i>
<i>the meaning of life,</i>

16:12.806 --> 16:17.043
<i>finally seeking</i>
<i>the wisdom of the High Geek.</i>

16:19.079 --> 16:22.315
-Hi, High Geek.
-Hi.

16:22.349 --> 16:26.252
I'm feeling low.
Tell me
the secret of happiness.

16:26.286 --> 16:29.222
Happiness? Well, that's easy.

16:29.255 --> 16:32.325
Marry a cheerleader,
and live at the beach!

16:32.359 --> 16:35.395
But cheerleaders
don't like me, and I peel.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.498
Zap!

16:38.531 --> 16:43.403
Here, take this retainer.
It will bring you good luck.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.171
Thanks.

16:46.272 --> 16:50.276
( chanting )

16:52.812 --> 16:55.315
Send in the next geek.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.853
Casey: <i>Slater didn't know</i>
<i>where he was going.</i>

16:59.886 --> 17:03.023
<i>But he knew he had</i>
<i>to get there fast.</i>

17:07.260 --> 17:14.034
Mindy kept her word. Zack was
a star, but not the kind of
star he wanted to be.

17:16.036 --> 17:19.906
What's the problem?
They loved you.
They absolutely loved you.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.474
Mindy, look at me.
I look like Mr. Madonna.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.511
That's good, baby.
A macho Madonna.

17:24.544 --> 17:28.248
-It isn't me.
-It doesn't matter.
It's what sells.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.785
No, no, no. It does matter to
me. You couldn't
hear a word I sang.

17:31.818 --> 17:35.955
Who cares?
Did you see the smoke,
the lights, the lasers?

17:36.056 --> 17:38.058
How could I?
I was blinded by them.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.393
( phone rings )

17:40.427 --> 17:42.162
Hello?

17:42.195 --> 17:44.064
Yes.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.233
Yes. Oh, no.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.169
Yeah, I'll be right there.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.571
Where are you going?
We have to leave for London.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.240
Mindy, l've got to
go to the hospital.
Slater's been hurt.

17:54.274 --> 17:57.444
Zack, I'm sorry, but I'm sure
the doctors could
take care of him.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.413
-Look,
I have to, he's my friend.
-No, you can't.

18:00.447 --> 18:04.250
You walk out that
door and you are
throwing everything away.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.286
I already have.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.922
Goodbye, Mindy.

18:11.224 --> 18:16.396
Kelly rushed from
her new role in life
to be at Slater's side.

18:17.530 --> 18:21.167
-How fast were you going?
-Only 275.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.204
I guess I
missed the stop sign.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.039
You look great.

18:26.039 --> 18:28.208
Kelly, I look awful.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.877
Do me a favor,
stop being Kelly.

18:30.910 --> 18:34.147
Okay, you look terrible.
Are you gonna die?

18:34.180 --> 18:36.316
No, I'm not gonna die.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.586
All right, where is he?
You stupid jock.

18:39.619 --> 18:43.623
Wait, don't hurt me, Lisa.
I just saw you on
''US Gladiators.''

18:43.656 --> 18:46.526
You beat up everybody,
including the audience.

18:46.559 --> 18:50.063
Yeah, nobody
messes with Lethal Lisa.

18:50.063 --> 18:52.198
It was dumb going out
and getting hurt like that.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.933
Ow!

18:55.301 --> 18:57.370
Kelly,
when did you become a nun?

18:57.404 --> 19:01.408
I'm not a nun.
I'm an actress
on <i>Santa Barbara.</i>

19:01.441 --> 19:04.411
Hello, my friends.
l've found
the meaning of life.

19:04.444 --> 19:08.181
-Her name is Linda.
-Yay, Linda!

19:08.214 --> 19:10.884
-How are you, Slater?
-Okay.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.919
Okay, yay!

19:13.019 --> 19:16.623
S-L-A-T-E-R, yay, Slater!

19:16.656 --> 19:21.061
lf you don't get rid of Linda,
I'm gonna throw
her out the winda.

19:21.094 --> 19:24.030
B-Y-E. Bye.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.367
Zack, what are you doing here?

19:27.400 --> 19:28.668
Well, I just heard
about Slater.

19:28.702 --> 19:32.238
-I got here as
fast as I could.
-That's how I got here, too.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.541
I never expected
to see you again.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.544
Me neither.
Since you're here,
let me hang up your hair.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.446
Don't touch my hair.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.649
You must learn to free
yourself from stress
and tension, Zachary.

19:42.682 --> 19:47.354
Look guys, I'm sorry.
It was wrong of me to
walk out of the band.

19:47.387 --> 19:51.257
-I hope we can
be friends again.
-Of course, Zachary.

19:51.291 --> 19:55.195
Come on,
follow me in this chant.
''Friends.'' Let's say it.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.397
''Friends, friends.''

19:57.430 --> 20:01.034
Well, you've got to admit
Screech does look peaceful.

20:01.067 --> 20:04.170
-Friends, friends.
-Zack: Friends, friends.

20:04.204 --> 20:08.141
-Join hands, join in.
-Friends, friends.

20:08.174 --> 20:13.279
And that brings us back to the
present, and the Zack
Attack's reunion concert.

20:13.313 --> 20:17.450
''Friends
Forever.'' It's a nice idea.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.387

-Hey, come on, Zack, wake up.
-What? What?

22:37.223 --> 22:39.759
-We've gotta practice.
-Tomorrow's our
first paying jig.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.728
-That's "gig," you idiot.
-Oh.

22:41.761 --> 22:44.431
-I just had
the strangest dream.
-Will you forget the dream?

22:44.464 --> 22:47.500
We've got to practice
for the Burkowitz bar mitzvah.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.903
-Okay. Let's do it.
-Yeah!

22:49.936 --> 22:54.307
