00:00.588 --> 00:02.855
I'm miss Phinney. Poor thing was
recently widowed...

00:02.855 --> 00:04.252
Yes, Dr. Hale,
I'm aware.

00:04.252 --> 00:05.950
No need to be ashamed
of your inexperience.

00:05.950 --> 00:07.688
 This is
my family's hotel.

00:07.678 --> 00:09.076
<i>You are the one
who doesn't belong.</i>

00:09.086 --> 00:11.881
Rent is payable upon
your pledging the loyalty oath.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.218
Ah, that's a pesky thing,
isn't it?

00:14.208 --> 00:16.905
This will not
be tolerated.
It was not
a surgical procedure.

00:16.915 --> 00:18.512
Your authorization
was not required.

00:18.512 --> 00:19.980
I got you something.
A bird.

00:19.980 --> 00:21.178
For when you want to fly away.

00:21.178 --> 00:23.146
I demand you get
to all of these men.

00:23.146 --> 00:24.844
We have started
building coffins.

00:24.844 --> 00:27.240
We got bodies.
They got boxes.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.519
You've no idea what you're
signing up for, do you?

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:17.894 --> 01:20.823
Careful not to split
the pine now.

01:56.858 --> 02:00.058
 Even Jesus had
a weak spot for the ladies.

02:00.068 --> 02:02.268
You heard of Mary Magdalene?

02:02.268 --> 02:03.768
She wasn't no nun.

02:03.768 --> 02:04.907
Hush now!

02:07.267 --> 02:10.797
Uh, off to fetch
the morning meals, miss.

02:13.007 --> 02:16.076
Isabella, water closet?

02:16.076 --> 02:18.336
Down the hall, miss Mary.

02:29.924 --> 02:31.494
Pardon us, Mr. green.

02:31.494 --> 02:33.393
More men coming down every day.

02:33.393 --> 02:35.594
We're gonna end this thing soon.

02:47.301 --> 02:50.801
"Cowards do not count in battle.

02:50.811 --> 02:56.251
They are there,
but are not in it."

02:58.080 --> 03:01.211
Euripides.

03:01.221 --> 03:04.260
I never put much stock
in the Greeks.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.879
Let me guess.
You're miffed with me.

03:07.889 --> 03:12.618
I saw you yesterday
with the federals,

03:12.628 --> 03:13.828
you and brother.

03:13.828 --> 03:17.268
It saddens me to think
that the men in this family...

03:17.268 --> 03:18.868
That you would...
That we would what?

03:18.868 --> 03:21.867
If we are not loyal
to the confederacy, father,

03:21.867 --> 03:23.127
then we are traitors.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.607
Is that not so?

03:24.607 --> 03:26.076
I am loyal to the confederacy.

03:26.076 --> 03:27.746
By doing business
with the enemy?

03:27.736 --> 03:29.266
We're not doing business
with them. That's...

03:29.276 --> 03:30.617
And commiserating
with these invaders?

03:30.607 --> 03:32.566
We are putting them in boxes!

03:41.654 --> 03:44.395
I have every faith that,
before long,

03:44.385 --> 03:48.054
these blue bastards
will smell Southern powder

03:48.054 --> 03:49.284
and feel Southern steel.

03:49.294 --> 03:51.733
In the meantime,
I will not allow

03:51.733 --> 03:53.434
everything that I have built

03:53.434 --> 03:55.463
and everything your grandfather
and his father built

03:55.463 --> 03:59.293
to be taken away, destroyed.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.712
You're young.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.002
Absolute.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.941
Someday, you'll see the world
in more than two colors.

04:11.481 --> 04:17.019
If that is your brand
of loyalty, I have my own.

04:17.019 --> 04:20.089
And I shall pursue it, no
matter what you or mother say.

04:20.089 --> 04:21.760
My goodness.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.829
This rebelliousness,
where does it come from?

04:25.829 --> 04:28.159
I've been told it's in my blood.

04:28.159 --> 04:30.288
You raised us to be charitable

04:30.299 --> 04:33.238
and to care for
the less fortunate.

04:33.228 --> 04:34.828
What better way to do that

04:34.828 --> 04:38.397
than by ministering
to our wounded boys?

04:38.407 --> 04:40.907
Your father and I
will discuss it.

04:43.707 --> 04:46.376
And today?

04:46.376 --> 04:48.546
May I go today?

05:06.894 --> 05:09.034
Emma! Wait!

05:09.034 --> 05:10.334
Are you off to the hospital?

05:10.334 --> 05:11.563
They approved?

05:11.563 --> 05:13.323
They accepted,
for the time being.

05:13.333 --> 05:14.802
Will you ask for tom again?

05:14.802 --> 05:18.203
Alice... About tom.

05:18.203 --> 05:19.862
Please, ask again.

05:22.372 --> 05:23.602
Oh. Wait.

05:23.612 --> 05:25.812
I must have a red ribbon.

05:25.812 --> 05:26.781
I have white already.

05:26.781 --> 05:28.851
It's weathered, but it'll do,

05:28.851 --> 05:31.481
and I need red, because red...

05:31.481 --> 05:34.940
Red and white is what the girls
have decided to wear

05:34.950 --> 05:38.080
as a secret sign of support
for the rebellion.

05:38.090 --> 05:40.260
How convenient.

05:40.260 --> 05:42.129
It also goes with
your favorite dress.

05:42.129 --> 05:45.829
Well, I may have had some
influence over the color choice.

05:45.829 --> 05:46.999
Do you have any?

05:46.999 --> 05:50.199
I sent Belinda to the store,
but it was shuttered.

05:50.199 --> 05:51.538
When I come back.

05:51.528 --> 05:53.758
I must run
before they change their mind.

05:58.708 --> 06:00.447
Give it back!
Give what back?

06:00.437 --> 06:02.066
What's the trouble here?

06:02.076 --> 06:03.546
This reprobate stole my leg!

06:03.546 --> 06:05.446
What would I want
with a piece of rotten wood?

06:05.446 --> 06:07.686
Use it for a club?
Make a fire?

06:07.676 --> 06:09.135
Stick it in your feckin' eye?!

06:09.145 --> 06:10.745
Soldier, return his prosthesis.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.075
But, miss, I...
Soldier!

06:12.085 --> 06:13.526
That leg is army-issued,

06:13.516 --> 06:14.876
which means you are stealing

06:14.886 --> 06:17.485
from the United States
government.

06:20.195 --> 06:21.624
Stop your moaning, beechum.

06:21.624 --> 06:23.324
We all got our burdens to bear.

06:23.324 --> 06:24.854
At least you got two legs
to bear it on.

06:24.864 --> 06:27.763
May I help you?
Um, yes, miss, if you would.

06:27.763 --> 06:30.323
Um, I'm, uh...
My name is...

06:30.333 --> 06:31.873
This is
Mr. Percival Squivers,

06:31.873 --> 06:33.573
a volunteer cadet
from the medical academy.

06:33.573 --> 06:35.243
This is miss Phinney.

06:35.243 --> 06:37.842
I'm meant to observe
and offer what assistance
I can. Thank you.

06:37.842 --> 06:40.612
Gonna fix this place right up,
ain't that so, Mr. Squivers?

06:40.612 --> 06:43.082
I have two years as apprentice
under Dr. pelham

06:43.082 --> 06:45.611
of fredericksburg
and a year at the academy.

06:45.611 --> 06:47.941
Oh, well, no need
to impress me, Mr. Squivers.

06:47.951 --> 06:49.251
It says here
you already have the job.

06:49.251 --> 06:52.120
Yes, of course.
Thank you.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.120
I'm told to report to, uh...

06:54.120 --> 06:55.220
Dr. hale?

06:55.220 --> 06:56.950
Yes, precisely.
Thank you.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.459
Stop thanking me,
Mr. Squivers.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.159
Miss Phinney!

07:00.159 --> 07:01.660
A moment, please.

07:01.660 --> 07:03.519
Thank you, nurse Mary.

07:05.129 --> 07:07.789
Matron Brannan,
how can I help you?

07:07.799 --> 07:10.758
What is corporal kilner's
status?

07:10.768 --> 07:13.007
Been here three days,
and we're short on beds.

07:13.007 --> 07:14.078
Yes, I know. I...

07:14.068 --> 07:15.767
You're to be the queen
of all nurses,

07:15.777 --> 07:17.148
you'll need to keep up.

07:17.138 --> 07:18.638
I'm waiting on Dr. hale.

07:18.648 --> 07:20.746
Dr. hale?
Is he not on the floor?

07:20.746 --> 07:22.646
I don't know where to find him.

07:22.646 --> 07:25.216
No, you wouldn't.

07:25.216 --> 07:28.885
But alas, I would.

07:30.086 --> 07:33.156
Dr. hale!

07:33.156 --> 07:35.324
Is he here?

07:35.324 --> 07:38.695
Is he here?!

07:41.423 --> 07:43.324
Miss Hastings!

07:43.334 --> 07:47.174
Little miss hoity-toity.

07:47.164 --> 07:48.463
Miss Hastings!

07:48.473 --> 07:50.103
Yes, matron Brannan?

07:50.103 --> 07:51.703
Do ask the good doctor

07:51.703 --> 07:53.903
if he might grace us with
his presence in the ward.

07:53.903 --> 07:56.061
The good what?
Why would you presume to...

07:56.071 --> 07:57.932
Ah, just because
I'm an old widow

07:57.942 --> 07:59.742
don't mean I've got mush
for brains.

07:59.742 --> 08:03.911
Don't. Stop it.

08:03.911 --> 08:05.371
Now.

08:05.381 --> 08:07.441
Byron!

08:07.451 --> 08:10.460
Go to work!

08:13.390 --> 08:16.030
And remember,
you treat that Sauerkraut

08:16.030 --> 08:18.430
with nothing but acerbity
and disdain.

08:18.430 --> 08:20.499
Miss Phinney?
But why?

08:20.499 --> 08:22.199
Go and do it.

08:26.838 --> 08:31.437
Tell me how you came to be here.

08:31.437 --> 08:36.037
Uh... Horses?

08:36.047 --> 08:37.217
Yes.

08:37.207 --> 08:40.977
N-n-n-n-nine.

08:40.977 --> 08:46.515
M-m-m-mud
on the r-r-r-r-road.

08:47.886 --> 08:53.115
Smelling of b-b-b-b-bay...
Ham.

08:53.125 --> 08:57.265
B-b-b-b-bacon.

08:57.265 --> 09:00.104
I-I'm sorry. I...

09:00.094 --> 09:01.293
Rest now, corporal.

09:01.293 --> 09:03.024
I'll be back to see you soon.

09:08.903 --> 09:10.463
Um...

09:10.472 --> 09:12.243
 Yes.

09:12.243 --> 09:16.751
Uh, I'll just wait over here.
Thank you.

09:17.412 --> 09:19.081
Who's the beanpole?

09:19.081 --> 09:21.151
Mr. Squivers,
a medical cadet.

09:21.151 --> 09:22.421
Hmm.

09:22.421 --> 09:25.021
I had some reservations
about Dr. hale's assessment.

09:25.021 --> 09:26.051
Did you?

09:26.051 --> 09:27.110
I did.
Mm.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.620
And I felt I could
no longer wait...

09:28.620 --> 09:30.080
How forward.

09:30.090 --> 09:32.730
Is that how miss Dix instructs
her nurses to behave?

09:32.730 --> 09:35.029
I hope we have not gotten off
on the wrong foot.

09:35.029 --> 09:38.399
The corporal has a condition
known as expressive aphemia.

09:38.399 --> 09:39.699
I'm not familiar with that.

09:39.699 --> 09:41.168
A fellow in France
named Pierre Paul broca

09:41.168 --> 09:42.638
has been studying
brain function.

09:42.638 --> 09:44.068
I worked with him
before the war.

09:44.068 --> 09:46.508
He's had a number of patients
like this man, kilner...

09:46.508 --> 09:49.037
Skull wounds
followed by aphemia...

09:49.037 --> 09:51.097
Who turned out to have
convolutions of the brain,

09:51.107 --> 09:52.047
requiring...

09:52.047 --> 09:56.017
Requiring you
to unhand my patient.

09:56.017 --> 09:57.886
Dr. hale.

09:57.876 --> 10:00.306
Ah, nurse Mary, how do you do?

10:01.116 --> 10:04.456
I mean, uh,
most disappointed, baroness.

10:04.456 --> 10:06.056
Most disappointed.

10:06.056 --> 10:07.125
Pardon?

10:07.125 --> 10:11.794
This man has a mild,
superficial laceration.

10:11.794 --> 10:14.065
His symptoms, such as they are,

10:14.065 --> 10:17.363
the chattery gobbledygook,
et cetera, are manufactured.

10:17.363 --> 10:18.763
A cowardly malingerer,

10:18.763 --> 10:21.093
he should be shipped back
to the nearest battlefield

10:21.103 --> 10:24.773
as soon as his ailment
has healed if not before.

10:24.773 --> 10:26.542
<i>Before he is healed?</i>

10:26.542 --> 10:28.413
I believe he has
a neurological deficit

10:28.403 --> 10:30.932
that may require trephination
and draining.

10:30.942 --> 10:33.382
Are you serious, man?

10:33.382 --> 10:36.312
Do you think he also
has evil spirits that
need to be released?

10:36.312 --> 10:38.771
Surely,
you are aware of the...
oh, I'm aware.

10:38.781 --> 10:42.181
I am also aware
of unicorns and mermaids.

10:42.191 --> 10:45.090
But I'm beginning to wonder,
Dr. foster,

10:45.090 --> 10:47.190
<i>if you are the one
with the deficit.</i>

10:47.190 --> 10:50.230
Uh, are you aware of his breath?

10:53.129 --> 10:54.769
Whiskey.

10:54.759 --> 10:55.890
Excuse us.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.269
And, uh, miss Phinney,

10:57.269 --> 10:58.970
many of the men have not
been fed since yesterday.

10:58.970 --> 11:01.468
We need to see to that.
Yes, doctor.

11:01.468 --> 11:02.758
The French have determined...

11:02.768 --> 11:04.499
Oh, we look to
the French now, do we?

11:04.508 --> 11:05.778
They eat frogs, you know.

11:05.778 --> 11:07.077
Uh, so do we, I believe.

11:07.077 --> 11:09.918
Miss Phinney!
Here we go.

11:09.908 --> 11:11.468
Where is that, exactly?

11:11.478 --> 11:13.067
To your meeting.

11:13.077 --> 11:14.176
My what, sir?

11:14.176 --> 11:17.076
Oh, yes, I've been directed
to arrange one

11:17.086 --> 11:19.456
by your good friend,
the dragon, miss Dix.

11:19.456 --> 11:22.625
A meeting?
Not surprising,

11:22.625 --> 11:26.996
knowing miss dix's fondness
for hot air and hierarchy.

11:26.996 --> 11:30.065
She is the wife
no man ever wanted.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.934
 Sir,
you need to acquaint yourself

11:31.934 --> 11:34.164
with current theories
of head trauma and aphemia.
I am well-acquainted,

11:34.164 --> 11:36.674
but I see no reason to put
a hole in that man's head

11:36.664 --> 11:38.663
when what he needs
is a kick in the ass

11:38.673 --> 11:40.104
back to the nearest battlefield.

11:40.104 --> 11:42.303
Then allow me
to do the procedure.
I will not.

11:42.303 --> 11:44.102
You are not authorized
to do a trephination.

11:44.102 --> 11:46.673
Not on him,
and not on a coconut.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.771
Look, don't we want
the same thing, hmm?

11:48.781 --> 11:50.752
What's best for the patient?

11:52.982 --> 11:56.181
Speak to me not in riddles, man.

11:56.181 --> 11:57.481
Leave him be.

11:57.481 --> 12:00.551
You should not have intervened
in the first place.

12:00.551 --> 12:02.810
Ladies, it is my intention

12:02.820 --> 12:05.250
to bring all of our needs
and goals together

12:05.260 --> 12:07.860
and give voice
to the nursing staff as a group.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.500
Have you nursed before?

12:09.500 --> 12:13.069
Aside from a few screeching
nephews and your dead husband?

12:13.069 --> 12:16.239
I have no claim to expertise.

12:16.239 --> 12:18.869
But I have been charged
with overseeing

12:18.869 --> 12:20.168
the nursing in this hospital,

12:20.168 --> 12:22.398
and I am eager
and capable to do that.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.977
Making sure that we do
the best job possible together

12:25.977 --> 12:28.918
to provide the finest treatment
for the boys.

12:28.918 --> 12:31.287
Yes, but why you?

12:32.246 --> 12:35.107
I petitioned miss Dix for
placement. She sent me here.

12:35.117 --> 12:36.617
Anyone else who would like
to go to her

12:36.617 --> 12:39.816
to become an official army nurse
is also free to do so.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.156
Uh...

12:43.556 --> 12:44.885
Miss green?

12:44.895 --> 12:47.094
This is the nurses' meeting?

12:47.094 --> 12:50.134
<i>Union nurses, miss.</i>

12:50.134 --> 12:53.004
The confederate boys
are patients.

12:53.004 --> 12:54.974
I'm their nurse.

12:54.964 --> 12:58.394
Please. Proceed.

13:01.243 --> 13:04.882
I intend to address
a wide array of matters...

13:04.872 --> 13:06.972
Diet, letter writing,

13:06.982 --> 13:09.411
attending to the doctors
as they need help.

13:09.411 --> 13:11.872
I would ask that you,
miss Hastings,

13:11.882 --> 13:13.981
be charged with training us all
in wound dressing

13:13.981 --> 13:16.751
as you are
so clearly expert at it.

13:16.751 --> 13:19.181
I have a question, miss Phinney.

13:19.191 --> 13:21.230
Will you see to it
that the confederate boys

13:21.220 --> 13:24.050
are treated fairly and equally?

13:25.630 --> 13:29.029
Pardon me, your eminence. I see
you've got this under control.

13:29.029 --> 13:32.289
Miss green, you are a volunteer,

13:32.299 --> 13:33.559
allowed to be here

13:33.569 --> 13:35.639
only by the good graces
of the United States...

13:35.639 --> 13:37.179
That's all right, matron.

13:37.169 --> 13:41.768
As long as they are here,
we will do our best for them.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.017
But I will not lie to you.

13:44.007 --> 13:47.407
Never at the expense
of a union soldier.

13:47.417 --> 13:48.788
Hmmph!

13:48.788 --> 13:51.316
That is cold comfort, miss.

13:51.316 --> 13:54.927
It is, isn't it?
Quite cold.

13:57.055 --> 13:58.495
What a disaster.

13:58.485 --> 14:00.855
Bah, they'll get used
to having someone above them...

14:00.855 --> 14:04.125
Someday.
After the war is over.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.555
Ah, nurse Mary, you are found.

14:06.565 --> 14:07.804
Did you meet
with Dr. hale?

14:07.794 --> 14:09.895
He said to stick by your side.

14:09.904 --> 14:11.734
Bully for me.

14:11.734 --> 14:13.163
Matron, I noted,

14:13.173 --> 14:16.303
as did Dr. foster in his
inimitably collegial way,

14:16.303 --> 14:19.203
that the morning meals
were late and sparse.
Were they now?

14:19.212 --> 14:21.013
I wonder if it would not be
too forward of me

14:21.013 --> 14:22.843
to offer my perspective
on the dietary need.

14:22.843 --> 14:26.402
The steward, Mr. bullen,
does as he deems fit,

14:26.412 --> 14:28.642
given the challenges
and supplies at hand.

14:28.652 --> 14:32.450
I understand.
You've got god and miss Dix
on your side, dear.

14:33.821 --> 14:36.321
Do as you deem fit.

14:37.321 --> 14:38.880
You don't want to see
Mr. Bullen, miss.

14:38.890 --> 14:40.750
Yes, I do.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.960
No.
No, you don't.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.360
I'm quite certain I do.

14:46.869 --> 14:49.939
Here we go
to see Mr. Bullen.

14:49.939 --> 14:52.369
Come, Squivers.

14:52.369 --> 14:55.398
Come.

14:57.478 --> 15:00.547
Oh, you scared me,
Mr. Bullen.

15:05.787 --> 15:07.756
Silas.

15:07.746 --> 15:10.377
Silas is fine.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.356
We're friends now, ain't we?

15:12.356 --> 15:15.955
That's what you want us to be,
friends?

15:15.955 --> 15:19.015
I want your help, yes.

15:19.025 --> 15:22.324
Seeing as you know
how things work,

15:22.334 --> 15:25.665
well, how property move
from place to place.

15:25.665 --> 15:27.895
You know, I...

15:27.905 --> 15:30.974
I got this.

15:30.974 --> 15:34.414
And a little money, too,
so I could pay you.

15:34.404 --> 15:36.333
It a bird.

15:37.843 --> 15:40.853
Pretty, ain't it?

15:40.843 --> 15:42.602
For your missus, maybe?

15:42.612 --> 15:45.012
I got no missus.

15:49.421 --> 15:52.261
I haven't gotten any information
for you yet,

15:52.261 --> 15:58.360
since the last time
you asked me, but I will, soon.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.560
I'd be obliged for anything.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.229
Well, even if I could just
get some word.

16:04.229 --> 16:08.099
A girl like you
in a town like this.

16:08.099 --> 16:10.469
I want to help you.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.868
I do.

16:11.868 --> 16:16.299
You need a friend to help you,
protect you.

16:18.007 --> 16:19.637
I reckon I do.

16:19.647 --> 16:21.387
And a man like me...

16:21.377 --> 16:24.477
Well...

16:24.487 --> 16:29.487
Any man gets lonely.

16:30.686 --> 16:35.955
Nothing wrong with two people
helping each other,

16:35.965 --> 16:38.195
ain't that right?

16:39.235 --> 16:41.334
Long as it stays between us.

16:42.465 --> 16:44.524
Please.

16:44.534 --> 16:47.144
We shouldn't.

16:47.134 --> 16:48.534
It wrong, sir.

16:48.534 --> 16:51.634
You want my friendship,
don't you?

17:08.451 --> 17:12.820
That death house is no place
for an innocent girl.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.970
Death house?
It's the mansion house hotel.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.790
Not anymore, it isn't.

17:19.800 --> 17:23.839
The physicians there look upon
nurses as their natural prey.

17:23.839 --> 17:27.378
Patients are exposed
from... from head to toe.

17:27.368 --> 17:30.168
The more time
our Emma spends there,

17:30.178 --> 17:33.208
the less innocence
there will be to preserve.

17:33.208 --> 17:36.138
How many compromises
must we make?

17:36.148 --> 17:39.248
I am the one making the most.
Trust me on that.

17:39.248 --> 17:43.877
Every day,
I make compromises with myself.

17:46.127 --> 17:48.397
It won't last.

17:48.387 --> 17:50.756
These Yankee warmongers
will soon realize

17:50.756 --> 17:53.156
you cannot start a war
to save a union.

17:53.166 --> 17:55.835
And until then,
you will do what?

17:55.835 --> 17:58.264
Just dance around
their loyalty oath?

17:58.264 --> 18:02.894
Eventually,
you will have to sign,

18:02.904 --> 18:04.674
or we will have to flee.

18:04.674 --> 18:06.603
It won't come to that.

18:06.603 --> 18:08.504
I promise.

18:10.014 --> 18:11.613
James.

18:11.613 --> 18:16.853
We can bear whatever we have to,

18:16.853 --> 18:19.282
but what about our children?

18:23.092 --> 18:25.991
Are you sure, tom?

18:25.991 --> 18:27.631
No visitors at all?

18:27.621 --> 18:28.981
Not even Alice?

18:28.990 --> 18:30.151
You tell her I'm here?

18:30.161 --> 18:32.660
No, no.
I told you, I wouldn't.

18:32.660 --> 18:35.590
I'm sorry.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.570
It's only that,
right now, like this,

18:38.570 --> 18:42.269
she'll think me weak for having
been captured

18:42.269 --> 18:46.199
or, worse even...
A coward,

18:46.209 --> 18:47.908
shirking my duty.

18:47.908 --> 18:49.879
She won't think that.
No one will.

18:49.879 --> 18:50.948
You don't know.

18:50.948 --> 18:53.577
You can't know.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.957
I looked into the eyes of a boy

18:57.947 --> 19:02.117
I would have shared bark juice
with last year.

19:02.117 --> 19:04.716
And instead, I...

19:04.726 --> 19:08.165
Shot him...

19:08.155 --> 19:09.756
Through the skull.

19:12.096 --> 19:13.956
 Miss green?

19:13.966 --> 19:15.734
Tom.

19:15.734 --> 19:18.034
I was wondering how your
appetite was progressing.

19:18.034 --> 19:20.035
He's well, chaplain.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.134
Oh.
I was under the impression...

19:22.134 --> 19:23.293
Now I am here.

19:23.303 --> 19:25.204
Tom will be my responsibility.

19:25.204 --> 19:29.532
I'm sure you have union men
to care for.

19:30.743 --> 19:34.543
The lord does not recognize
uniforms, miss.

19:36.382 --> 19:38.382
God be with you, tom.

19:45.761 --> 19:47.831
Don't trust them.

19:47.831 --> 19:50.400
Not even holy Joe.

19:51.900 --> 19:56.840
I heard a Yankee boy had
his mother's heirloom cabbaged

19:56.840 --> 20:00.409
right out of his boot
where he'd hid it.

20:02.509 --> 20:03.979
Here.

20:05.879 --> 20:08.118
Keep it for me.

20:08.108 --> 20:09.868
You have to.

20:09.878 --> 20:12.307
Let me talk to the matron.
I'll ask her to make sure...

20:12.317 --> 20:14.917
No, she'll lie.

20:14.917 --> 20:17.488
They all lie.

20:18.456 --> 20:20.597
It's got
all my trappings inside...

20:20.587 --> 20:25.916
Letters, a tintype from Alice,
my father's pipe.

20:27.025 --> 20:28.685
You remember papa?

20:29.636 --> 20:32.365
He was a fine man, your father.

20:32.365 --> 20:37.064
Please, ems, hold it for me...

20:37.074 --> 20:39.305
Till I'm better.

21:02.021 --> 21:03.380
Miss?

21:03.390 --> 21:05.551
Are you Mr. Bullen?

21:05.561 --> 21:08.660
Abel melcher, the bean boiler.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.960
Miss Phinney is a new lady nurse
sent from the army.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.740
She hasn't eaten since
yesterday. Well, we were hop...

21:14.740 --> 21:16.109
Missed her gruel?

21:16.109 --> 21:19.909
We'll get something to you,
miss, as soon as we can.

21:19.909 --> 21:21.910
You are Mr. Bullen?

21:21.910 --> 21:24.169
Yes, m'lady.

21:24.179 --> 21:28.188
I wish to address both you
and Mr. Melcher on a matter.

21:28.179 --> 21:30.137
Address us?

21:31.118 --> 21:32.917
Wounded soldiers
should not be kept waiting

21:32.917 --> 21:34.047
for their sustenance.

21:34.057 --> 21:36.826
It's commonly accepted
that nutrition is vital...

21:38.726 --> 21:41.596
Pardon me.

21:41.596 --> 21:44.266
Bad taste in my mouth.

21:44.266 --> 21:47.366
Is vital for convalescing men.

21:47.366 --> 21:51.305
And what do you think is vital
for, uh...

21:51.305 --> 21:54.074
Interfering strumpets?

21:56.645 --> 21:59.714
I would ask that you attend
to your words, Mr. Bullen.

21:59.714 --> 22:03.913
My words is my words,
and this is my kitchen.

22:03.913 --> 22:06.813
<i>And those men upstairs
are my patients.</i>

22:06.813 --> 22:08.113
Our patients, truly.

22:08.113 --> 22:10.912
Then get to them, then!

22:10.922 --> 22:13.822
You know the way up.

22:20.831 --> 22:22.961
Where did all this come from?

22:22.961 --> 22:26.090
You got no business here,
miss Phinney.

22:26.100 --> 22:27.570
Don't come down again.

22:27.570 --> 22:29.240
I insist you answer!

22:29.240 --> 22:31.410
Go on now, you damn bitch!

22:31.400 --> 22:33.459
Please!
Dirty whore!

22:33.469 --> 22:35.229
Mary...
You have no right, sir!

22:35.239 --> 22:36.529
Nurse Mary!
No right!

22:36.539 --> 22:38.639
Hey, boss. All right.
Boss, that's enough.

22:38.639 --> 22:41.308
Easy, easy now.

22:41.308 --> 22:44.879
It ain't worth all this.

22:44.879 --> 22:47.477
Miss, you'll wait till dinner.

22:47.487 --> 22:49.618
Next time, don't be late.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.717
Boy, you get the patient grub
when you get it.

22:51.717 --> 22:55.446
Now, take this fine lady

22:55.456 --> 22:58.687
back up to the wards
where she belongs.

23:08.235 --> 23:10.945
Um, miss, are you all right?

23:10.935 --> 23:17.504
I will fetch you something
from... Somewhere.

23:17.514 --> 23:19.614
Not down there.

23:29.453 --> 23:30.912
Here.

23:32.622 --> 23:35.382
You are very generous.

23:35.392 --> 23:36.881
You rest.

23:36.891 --> 23:39.721
I'll check on you in a bit.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.270
Orderly?

23:46.270 --> 23:47.940
Nurse?

23:47.940 --> 23:50.010
Yes, soldier?

23:51.239 --> 23:53.539
Two days.

23:53.539 --> 23:55.339
Haven't ate in two days.

23:55.339 --> 23:57.739
Please.

23:57.749 --> 24:01.418
Just bring some food.

24:45.553 --> 24:47.611
You ain't wearing the necklace.

24:47.621 --> 24:49.961
It too pretty for every day.

24:53.791 --> 24:55.691
You got troubles, don't you?

24:55.691 --> 24:58.061
Aw, same as anyone, I guess.

24:58.061 --> 25:01.890
There's a man named Miller
I know, free man from Brooklyn.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.610
He's working to help runaways.

25:04.601 --> 25:07.160
I'm free already.

25:07.170 --> 25:10.499
Don't need nothing but work
hard, keep my eyes down.

25:10.509 --> 25:14.419
Hey...
If you ever did need something,

25:14.409 --> 25:18.208
well, here I be.

25:18.218 --> 25:20.288
Now, we all could use a hand
now and again.

25:20.288 --> 25:21.318
"We"?

25:21.318 --> 25:23.287
Who "we"?

25:23.287 --> 25:26.527
You from some fancy house
in Philadelphia?

25:26.527 --> 25:29.797
You in school,
dressed in fine clothes,

25:29.797 --> 25:30.927
never beat, ever sold?

25:30.927 --> 25:33.666
Ain't that right,
Mr. diggs?

25:33.666 --> 25:36.297
Now, where I come from...

25:38.035 --> 25:42.536
seen things, heard things,
done some things.

25:42.536 --> 25:44.994
Ain't no "we," thank you.

25:45.004 --> 25:46.744
And I don't need nothing.

25:46.744 --> 25:50.215
Not from a man named Miller
and not from you.

26:35.178 --> 26:38.108
Home so soon?

26:38.118 --> 26:40.358
We're having a sewing circle.

26:40.358 --> 26:42.228
Care to join us?

26:42.218 --> 26:44.488
I just had to fetch something.

26:44.488 --> 26:46.587
I must get back to the ward.

26:46.597 --> 26:49.197
Emma?

26:49.197 --> 26:53.867
You know, a parent can feel
proud and angry at a child

26:53.867 --> 26:56.036
for the very same reason.

26:58.205 --> 26:59.936
It's true.

26:59.936 --> 27:02.965
Someday you'll have children,
and you'll see.

27:10.114 --> 27:12.484
Jimmy: The peninsula will be
the end of it, father.

27:12.484 --> 27:15.354
Those yellow dogs
will never get to Richmond.

27:15.354 --> 27:16.753
Where's your cane?

27:16.753 --> 27:18.793
I was waiting for you to notice.

27:18.783 --> 27:20.753
See how much better my walk is?

27:20.753 --> 27:22.812
You should use a cane.

27:22.822 --> 27:24.852
Ex-excuse me, sir.

27:24.862 --> 27:28.502
This... this is Ben Cooper,
my nephew.

27:28.492 --> 27:30.721
He got something
he wants to say.

27:30.731 --> 27:34.071
Ever since I come up here,
i-i feel like a new man.

27:34.071 --> 27:37.810
Now I got you and my uncle
to thank for that.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.360
You do a good job, boy,
work hard.

27:40.370 --> 27:42.730
That's how you're gonna earn
the freedom

27:42.740 --> 27:44.200
this war's gonna get you.

27:44.210 --> 27:47.109
Yes, sir.

27:47.109 --> 27:48.839
We'll get back at it now.

27:48.849 --> 27:51.089
Excuse me, sir.

27:55.548 --> 27:57.108
Why say that to him?

27:57.118 --> 28:00.618
After this war is done,
slavery will remain.

28:00.628 --> 28:02.597
Isn't that the whole point?

28:02.587 --> 28:06.156
For cotton farmers
and plantation owners, perhaps,

28:06.166 --> 28:07.066
but for us?

28:07.066 --> 28:10.637
Furniture makers?
Businessmen?

28:10.637 --> 28:12.665
We don't need it, Jimmy.

28:12.665 --> 28:14.665
It's time we reckon with that.

28:14.665 --> 28:18.065
Mr. green!
Yanks coming up the road.

28:19.845 --> 28:21.774
Where...
Where is it?

28:22.504 --> 28:25.375
Tom! Tom!

28:25.375 --> 28:27.073
Where is it?!

28:27.083 --> 28:29.613
You stole my father's watch,
you blue devils!

28:29.613 --> 28:31.813
Where is it?!
Easy, tom!

28:31.813 --> 28:33.114
No one has taken
anything from you!

28:33.124 --> 28:35.722
You lying scoundrels,
all of you!

28:35.722 --> 28:36.953
Aah!

28:36.953 --> 28:38.882
Leave him.
You're making it worse.

28:38.893 --> 28:40.322
I may need a doctor myself.

28:40.322 --> 28:42.222
Tom, tom, tom! Tom!

28:42.222 --> 28:44.221
Tom, your things are safe.

28:44.231 --> 28:46.762
The watch is at my house,
in my room.

28:46.762 --> 28:49.091
Now, be peaceful.

28:54.501 --> 28:55.800
This man is disturbed.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.160
He needs to be under
constant observation.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.670
You're agitating him.
He's calm now.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.779
Miss, you need to understand.
Your friend is a danger to
himself and to others.

29:02.779 --> 29:04.219
Truly, he is not!

29:09.588 --> 29:12.019
He is coming for us all!

29:12.019 --> 29:13.818
No stopping him!

29:13.818 --> 29:16.817
And more right behind!

29:16.827 --> 29:18.928
I have seen the elephant!

29:23.667 --> 29:24.997
Better, miss?

29:24.997 --> 29:27.266
Stifling in here.
Quite.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.737
What do they say at the academy
about ward ventilation?

29:29.737 --> 29:34.005
Uh...
Ward ventilation?

29:34.005 --> 29:36.905
They say it's important, I bet.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.935
Uncirculated air, effluvia...

29:38.945 --> 29:41.814
They can deepen illness,
maybe even spread it.

29:41.814 --> 29:45.084
But somebody sealed
these windows shut.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.384
What we need is a constant
supply of fresh air.

29:47.384 --> 29:50.153
Let me try getting
some of these unsealed.

29:50.153 --> 29:53.493
Dr. berenson of Philadelphia
was a very good teacher.

29:53.493 --> 29:55.562
And a good man.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.362
Miss Phinney, come along!

30:02.362 --> 30:04.792
Should I find Dr. hale?
Come!

30:04.802 --> 30:06.501
It's corporal Kilner.

30:06.501 --> 30:08.901
Oh, dear.

30:08.901 --> 30:12.331
Red u-u-under...
Under way.

30:12.341 --> 30:14.410
Come! Remember!

30:14.410 --> 30:15.380
Remember!

30:15.370 --> 30:16.870
Ran away from subscriber

30:16.880 --> 30:19.010
on the night of Monday,
the 12th, march.

30:19.010 --> 30:22.109
Negro male named Ben Cooper,
30 years of age,

30:22.109 --> 30:26.239
5'7" high, of dark color,
heavy in the chest.

30:26.249 --> 30:28.208
And upon his body,
several lashes,

30:28.218 --> 30:30.088
both old and new of the whip.

30:30.088 --> 30:32.258
One straight down the back.

30:36.598 --> 30:38.997
$150.

30:38.997 --> 30:40.667
Prices running low down south?

30:40.667 --> 30:43.766
I've been dispatched from my
employer to retrieve this man.

30:43.766 --> 30:45.306
He was accused
of stealing property.

30:45.296 --> 30:47.796
By which you mean
stealing himself.

30:47.806 --> 30:49.606
And his clothes, his shoes.

30:49.606 --> 30:50.945
May have took a saddle, too.

30:50.935 --> 30:52.265
Gentlemen, you have no authority

30:52.275 --> 30:53.945
to assist the return
of this man.

30:53.945 --> 30:55.745
He is free in Alexandria.

30:55.745 --> 30:57.584
Well, he ain't in Carolina.

30:58.775 --> 31:00.605
We're not in Carolina.

31:00.615 --> 31:03.183
Mr. green,
we'll handle our business.

31:03.183 --> 31:04.884
You handle yours.

31:06.883 --> 31:10.513
Make sure there's no such man
on the floor.

31:10.523 --> 31:12.422
Go now, be certain.

31:19.192 --> 31:21.661
Most of my employees
are freeborn.

31:21.661 --> 31:25.231
As for the contraband, we're
very careful about who we hire.

31:26.871 --> 31:28.610
We'll see for ourselves.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.270
As soon as my son returns.

31:31.270 --> 31:33.400
Now.

31:39.479 --> 31:40.639
Hey! Hey!

31:44.889 --> 31:46.788
I was freed in Tennessee!

31:46.788 --> 31:48.729
I got papers, I swear!

31:52.528 --> 31:53.727
It ain't him.

31:53.727 --> 31:55.568
I told you, he's not here.

31:55.558 --> 31:58.157
Get moving!

31:58.167 --> 32:01.067
That boy's somewhere
in this nigger-loving town.

32:06.136 --> 32:07.896
Lionel took the boy home.

32:07.906 --> 32:09.975
Ben says he did nothing wrong,

32:09.975 --> 32:13.614
claims he's the same
as any other contraband.

32:13.614 --> 32:18.554
Indeed, he is,
in that he's meant to be free.

32:20.215 --> 32:23.444
Um, so, uh, you're
going to do what?

32:23.454 --> 32:26.454
Bore a small hole in his skull
to help relieve the pressure.

32:26.454 --> 32:30.712
Yes, I know what trephination
is, but, um, um, what?

32:30.722 --> 32:32.153
Hold this.

32:32.163 --> 32:33.533
A bit more ether.

32:33.533 --> 32:36.101
We don't want him waking up
in the middle.

32:41.202 --> 32:43.471
How's that?
Good enough.

32:43.471 --> 32:49.180
All right, Squivers, I'm going
to put the tip here on his head.

32:50.380 --> 32:53.050
Cadet down!

32:53.050 --> 32:54.210
Move him away.

32:54.210 --> 32:56.469
Oh, dear.
Isabella, tend to him.

32:56.479 --> 32:58.379
That's what you get these days
from a higher education.

32:58.379 --> 33:00.639
Shall I find a doctor to assist?

33:00.649 --> 33:02.380
You do it.

33:02.390 --> 33:05.388
Ask yourself,
"what would Dix do?"

33:06.588 --> 33:08.519
If Dr. hale finds out...

33:08.529 --> 33:10.597
I'm almost done with this place.
No need to worry for me.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.627
I was thinking of myself,
actually.

33:12.627 --> 33:15.488
Well, this boy has
no time to wait.

33:15.498 --> 33:16.797
Hold his head.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.167
Are you trembling?

33:24.175 --> 33:26.805
I've missed my medicine today.

33:26.805 --> 33:28.536
I'll be all right.

33:31.215 --> 33:34.215
Be prepared.
This may bleed a bit.

33:34.215 --> 33:37.190
Yes.
I expect so.

33:40.699 --> 33:43.469
His conduct impinges on the
functioning of this hospital.

33:43.469 --> 33:45.567
The situation is intolerable.

33:45.567 --> 33:47.737
Foster is an excellent doctor.

33:47.737 --> 33:49.436
Attila was an excellent general.

33:49.436 --> 33:52.436
Not your sort of fellow.
Noted. Carry on, Samuel.

33:52.436 --> 33:53.705
Can't shave when you talk, sir.

33:53.705 --> 33:55.404
I have not worked
all of these years

33:55.404 --> 33:57.404
to be disrespected
by a civilian doctor.
Hale.

33:57.404 --> 34:00.703
Hale, can you not see
that I am under the knife?

34:00.712 --> 34:03.841
You have your way, hale.
He has his.

34:03.841 --> 34:07.739
You are an efficient
and pragmatic surgeon.

34:07.749 --> 34:10.879
He is of a more
experimental inclination.

34:10.879 --> 34:12.679
There's room for both
your methods here.

34:12.679 --> 34:14.706
What about this nursing
conflagration?

34:14.717 --> 34:16.056
Miss Phinney is fine.

34:16.047 --> 34:18.545
She's... well, she's lovely,
in fact.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.786
But if you allow her
to have authority,

34:20.786 --> 34:23.414
miss Hastings
is apt to murder her or you

34:23.424 --> 34:26.293
or me or all of us.

34:26.293 --> 34:28.292
My advice would be
to leave the women

34:28.292 --> 34:30.592
to work it out
amongst themselves.

34:30.592 --> 34:34.121
Dr. Sam,
resume the procedure.

34:34.130 --> 34:35.230
Yes, sir.

34:35.230 --> 34:37.498
I must report
a grievous atrocity!

34:37.498 --> 34:38.899
They're going to do what?

34:38.899 --> 34:40.297
A trephination, sir.

34:40.297 --> 34:41.659
Uh-huh.
You see what I mean?

34:41.668 --> 34:43.268
The French put it in his head.

34:43.268 --> 34:45.896
Nothing but trouble,
the damn French.

34:45.906 --> 34:47.206
He killed him.

34:47.206 --> 34:48.946
It should only take a moment.

34:58.282 --> 35:00.451
What the hell's
going on, foster?

35:00.451 --> 35:02.381
I will tell you presently.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.949
Can you hear me, corporal?

35:11.917 --> 35:13.117
Doc?

35:13.117 --> 35:15.416
Where are you, son?

35:18.625 --> 35:19.795
Hospital.

35:21.794 --> 35:24.364
In answer to your question,
major,

35:24.364 --> 35:26.102
we have just saved
this man's life.

35:26.092 --> 35:28.521
Part of my job description.

35:28.531 --> 35:31.770
Is Dr. hale's
somehow different?

35:33.400 --> 35:36.499
We'll get them
to leave Ben alone.

35:36.499 --> 35:40.427
<i>And after that, we must get them
to leave us alone.</i>

35:41.877 --> 35:45.776
Harkins: You are in no position
to demand anything, sir.

35:45.776 --> 35:49.185
When I was in Indian territory,

35:49.175 --> 35:52.503
we shot runaway redskins
on sight.

35:52.513 --> 35:55.422
Alexandria is not
Indian territory.

35:55.412 --> 35:59.312
No, and here in
union-occupied territory,

35:59.322 --> 36:01.260
it is my business, not yours,

36:01.250 --> 36:04.679
whether to help recapture
escaped slaves.

36:04.689 --> 36:09.057
It's mine, too,
when it impinges on...

36:09.057 --> 36:11.826
How do I put it...
My business.

36:11.826 --> 36:13.096
You're a southerner.

36:13.096 --> 36:15.734
I should think you would
sympathize with our efforts

36:15.724 --> 36:19.454
to maintain relations
with our confederate brethren.

36:19.464 --> 36:20.694
You may want to start

36:20.704 --> 36:22.932
by refraining
from slaughtering them.

36:22.932 --> 36:27.861
Sir, Negroes are free
in Alexandria.

36:27.871 --> 36:31.740
Your law, not ours,
but I abide by it willingly.

36:31.740 --> 36:34.179
Transitions can be difficult.

36:34.909 --> 36:38.717
Growing pains and all that.

36:38.707 --> 36:42.276
Even so,
we have a deal, captain.

36:42.276 --> 36:44.305
It should exempt me
and my employees

36:44.315 --> 36:46.784
from arbitrary harassment.

36:48.353 --> 36:53.552
You think war
is a game you can play at?

36:53.552 --> 36:55.651
It is not, sir.

36:55.651 --> 37:00.879
Nothing can be dependent on,
including your attempt

37:00.889 --> 37:05.487
to carve out a special place
for yourself here.

37:05.497 --> 37:10.096
So, the greater question
you must ask yourself is this...

37:10.096 --> 37:13.354
Which side are you on?

37:13.364 --> 37:20.432
Because very soon, sir,
you will have to choose.

37:23.371 --> 37:26.470
Just what do you think
you're doing?

37:26.470 --> 37:28.540
Trying to improve
the ventilation in the ward,

37:28.540 --> 37:29.639
miss Hastings.

37:29.639 --> 37:32.108
On whose authority?

37:33.317 --> 37:34.817
Oh!

37:36.987 --> 37:41.325
I saw a light,
maybe it was a tunnel,

37:41.315 --> 37:45.484
and, uh, uh,
there was a figure there...

37:45.484 --> 37:46.983
Beseeching me.

37:46.993 --> 37:51.161
It was probably Dr. Foster
begging you to go away.

37:51.161 --> 37:55.530
It was, uh...
So haunting.

37:55.530 --> 37:59.229
You're fine now, Mr. Squivers.
You'll be fine.

37:59.229 --> 38:01.397
Presumptuous, officious,
manipulative.

38:01.397 --> 38:02.598
May I help you?

38:02.598 --> 38:03.997
You are not only pompous,

38:03.997 --> 38:06.126
but now you are aiding
that renegade doctor

38:06.136 --> 38:10.105
in usurping Dr. Hale's authority
as chief operating surgeon.

38:10.105 --> 38:12.704
That was not by design.
I know what you're up to.

38:12.704 --> 38:15.603
I was raised on the streets of east London.
You can't hoodwink a hoodwinker.

38:15.603 --> 38:18.301
Sorry?
You come here
with your Yankee charms

38:18.311 --> 38:20.041
and your abolitionist
seductions.

38:20.041 --> 38:21.740
<i>This will not stand.</i>

38:21.740 --> 38:23.300
Miss Hastings, I assure you,

38:23.310 --> 38:25.209
I respect and admire
your experience.
My experience?

38:25.209 --> 38:27.568
And I look forward to learning
from your many years of...

38:27.578 --> 38:29.307
I am not old, madam!

38:29.317 --> 38:32.156
I only mean, I want what's best
for the boys, as do you,

38:32.146 --> 38:34.646
as you did in the Crimea
with miss Nightingale.

38:34.656 --> 38:37.485
You have a silvery tongue,
baroness Von olnhausen.

38:37.485 --> 38:39.085
But Dix or no Dix,

38:39.085 --> 38:41.453
I am the senior nurse
in this hospital,

38:41.453 --> 38:42.913
and I'll not be done in

38:42.923 --> 38:45.582
by some Dutch widow
with a twinkle in her eye.

38:45.592 --> 38:47.562
Miss Hastings?

38:48.591 --> 38:51.690
Please.
May I call you Anne?

38:53.099 --> 38:54.630
I understand.

38:54.630 --> 38:56.729
This has been your roost
to rule until now,

38:56.739 --> 38:59.337
and I have interfered with that.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.377
That was not my intention.

39:01.367 --> 39:04.765
And if, as I suspect,
your temper is because you feel

39:04.775 --> 39:07.575
your identity as a nurse
is all you have in this life,

39:07.575 --> 39:10.114
well, so do I.

39:12.213 --> 39:15.352
We are the same in that way.

39:15.342 --> 39:18.111
We are women in a man's world.

39:18.111 --> 39:21.909
Let us not make enemies
of each other.

40:03.944 --> 40:07.714
What a heroic maneuver today.

40:07.714 --> 40:09.613
Oh. Thank you,
miss Hastings.

40:09.613 --> 40:12.512
Are you in pain?
Here, allow me.

40:12.512 --> 40:16.380
You're so devoted to the men,

40:16.380 --> 40:21.719
<i>so committed to taking care of
them, but who takes care of you?</i>

40:22.688 --> 40:24.627
Well, my wife makes a go of it.

40:24.627 --> 40:27.227
Of course.
Of course, she does.

40:27.227 --> 40:28.796
Dr. foster?

40:28.796 --> 40:31.025
Dr. summers
would see you now.

40:37.433 --> 40:43.340
"Flouted procedure, et cetera.

40:43.330 --> 40:47.259
Engaged in unauthorized
and inappropriate procedure.

40:47.269 --> 40:53.697
Refused to perform others
in keeping with regulation."

40:53.707 --> 40:56.466
Naughty, naughty surgeon.

40:56.476 --> 40:57.965
You have not been playing well

40:57.975 --> 40:59.935
with some of your
commissioned colleagues.

40:59.945 --> 41:02.774
Dr. hale has a way
of bringing out the best in me.

41:02.784 --> 41:05.822
He's prepared to submit this
to the surgeon general.

41:07.552 --> 41:09.552
My contract's finished
next week, sir.

41:09.552 --> 41:11.281
If you'll allow me
to complete my term...

41:11.291 --> 41:12.860
I will not.

41:14.319 --> 41:16.849
I want more.

41:16.859 --> 41:19.258
I want you to stay beyond it.

41:19.258 --> 41:22.927
Uncivilized environment,
hopeless wounds,

41:22.927 --> 41:25.626
incompetent support,
an excess of work,

41:25.626 --> 41:27.325
paltry compensation.

41:27.335 --> 41:29.204
We offer every enticement.

41:33.163 --> 41:37.132
But an unparalleled
medical opportunity.

41:38.172 --> 41:40.740
I won't deny that part of me
wants to stay on.

41:40.740 --> 41:43.540
There's work to do here,
work that matters.

41:43.540 --> 41:44.899
But hale's right.

41:44.909 --> 41:46.978
Eh.
I-I'm not
military material.

41:46.978 --> 41:50.377
I bristle at the restrictions,
the hierarchy, the regulations.

41:50.377 --> 41:53.007
Oh, good.

41:53.016 --> 41:54.985
I'm sick of parrots
and lemmings,

41:54.985 --> 41:57.355
so is surgeon general Hammond.

41:57.355 --> 42:00.854
That's why he's instituted
a more stringent medical exam.

42:00.854 --> 42:04.922
Take the test, continue on as
a full-fledged military doctor.

42:04.922 --> 42:08.461
But there are
other factors, sir.

42:08.461 --> 42:09.930
My wife, Eliza...

42:09.920 --> 42:12.020
Oh.
There's always a wife.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.929
I promised her we'd go out west.

42:14.929 --> 42:17.227
She's got family
near redwood city.

42:17.227 --> 42:18.927
Is that what you want,

42:18.927 --> 42:22.456
curing rich people's
runny noses in California?

42:22.466 --> 42:25.505
I don't believe I can persuade
her to stay in Alexandria.

42:25.505 --> 42:27.274
That's not what I asked.

42:29.204 --> 42:31.643
Well, think on it.

42:35.041 --> 42:37.440
How's that brother of yours?

42:37.440 --> 42:39.200
Evan, was it?

42:39.210 --> 42:40.910
Ezra.

42:40.910 --> 42:43.838
Mm. Furloughed,
or is he in it now?

42:43.848 --> 42:46.717
In it,
fighting on the peninsula.

42:48.147 --> 42:50.906
Godspeed to him.

42:57.294 --> 42:58.623
Oh!

42:58.623 --> 42:59.762
Miss green, I'm sorry,
I didn't...

42:59.752 --> 43:02.282
Be more observant.
I will.

43:02.292 --> 43:05.001
I will be extremely observant
of you in the future.

43:06.760 --> 43:10.159
I hope you find
the accommodations suitable.

43:10.169 --> 43:12.638
They're more suitable every day.

43:12.628 --> 43:15.128
The opposite is true for me.

43:15.138 --> 43:18.906
Ah, well, you must let me know
how I might be of service.

43:22.835 --> 43:25.064
Uh, you're gonna pull that
right out of your head.

43:25.074 --> 43:26.843
Have you no ribbon?

43:26.843 --> 43:29.312
I could perhaps
find you some in town.

43:29.312 --> 43:31.652
I have some still.

43:31.642 --> 43:34.700
You have not impoverished us
quite yet.

43:34.710 --> 43:37.440
Red would be fetching.

44:09.098 --> 44:12.097
I'm sorry if I made you mad.

44:13.907 --> 44:16.005
Best to keep to myself.

44:16.005 --> 44:18.745
Ain't nothing against you.

44:18.745 --> 44:20.574
I don't know much,

44:20.574 --> 44:25.503
but I do know
what hurt looks like.

44:25.513 --> 44:30.450
And one thing about hurting is,
it's best not to do it alone.

44:34.619 --> 44:37.188
No.
Oh, here, here.

44:37.188 --> 44:41.087
Don't!

44:41.087 --> 44:43.447
You can't.

44:44.926 --> 44:48.595
Sammy, get back out there, boy.

44:48.595 --> 44:51.233
Work to be done.

45:41.396 --> 45:43.395
"Dearest Alice,

45:43.395 --> 45:46.325
this is the seventh letter
I've written to you

45:46.335 --> 45:48.203
but all remain unsent.

45:48.203 --> 45:52.002
No mail goes out,
nor comes in now.

45:52.002 --> 45:55.471
This distance makes
my heart ache.

45:55.471 --> 46:00.739
Until I came to the peninsula,
I did not know fear,

46:00.739 --> 46:04.668
and war was but an idea.

46:04.678 --> 46:08.347
But now,
it is both fearful and real,

46:08.347 --> 46:14.855
and like nothing you could ever
imagine or should."

46:19.453 --> 46:21.522
Why do you have his things?

46:24.321 --> 46:27.719
He's dead, isn't he?

46:27.730 --> 46:30.958
My tom is dead.

46:31.958 --> 46:35.927
That chicken guts
is right about one thing.

46:35.927 --> 46:38.595
We need to worry
about ourselves now.

46:38.595 --> 46:43.595
Sad when conscience becomes a
luxury we can no longer afford.

46:45.733 --> 46:47.293
Back down where you came from.

46:47.303 --> 46:49.802
Please, sir. My wife and
young'uns are just across town,

46:49.802 --> 46:51.301
waiting for me to come home.

46:54.140 --> 46:57.099
Hurry. Come on.
Move it.

46:57.109 --> 46:59.838
Go on.

46:59.848 --> 47:03.188
This is not our battle.

47:25.929 --> 47:28.268
Getting late, missus.

47:28.268 --> 47:32.467
Dr. foster's probably got
caught up at the hospital.

47:34.435 --> 47:36.506
He'll come, Jenny.

47:38.505 --> 47:40.345
He'll come.

47:40.345 --> 47:43.813
Did you forget or simply choose
a higher priority?

47:43.813 --> 47:45.242
I am sorry, Eliza.

47:45.242 --> 47:48.041
Every time I think I can leave,
something prevents me.

47:48.041 --> 47:50.170
You promised.
We need to plan our travel.

47:50.180 --> 47:54.519
Yes, yes, but there
is something else to discuss.

47:54.519 --> 47:59.818
Dr. summers...
He has asked me to stay on.

47:59.818 --> 48:04.176
And my experiments,
i-i feel optimistic.

48:04.186 --> 48:07.045
I may be discovering things
which could help people.

48:07.055 --> 48:08.714
We all have a purpose.

48:08.724 --> 48:12.193
Maybe mine was to be here,
saving lives.

48:12.193 --> 48:14.062
Pardon me.

48:19.901 --> 48:21.470
I have been patient, Jed.

48:21.470 --> 48:24.838
I have waited, made sacrifices,

48:24.838 --> 48:26.768
all based on our agreement.

48:26.768 --> 48:28.498
You can't betray that now.

48:28.508 --> 48:31.206
Not if this marriage
is truly the partnership

48:31.206 --> 48:32.976
you have promised me.

48:32.976 --> 48:35.945
These are turbulent times,
Eliza.

48:35.945 --> 48:37.473
We need to be open to change.

48:37.473 --> 48:39.633
I am not open to it!
I repudiate it!

48:40.843 --> 48:42.343
Stop that now, miss Phinney.

48:42.343 --> 48:45.241
I found a place for you
in one of the upstairs rooms.

48:45.251 --> 48:48.050
It's reserved for visiting
families of patients,

48:48.050 --> 48:49.890
but it's free.

48:49.880 --> 48:53.578
You've earned
a decent night's rest.

48:56.218 --> 48:58.177
So as your wife,
I am telling you,

48:58.187 --> 49:00.645
you must choose,
what is more important...

49:00.655 --> 49:02.955
This marriage or this war?

49:02.955 --> 49:06.324
If I don't have an answer
by the morning,

49:06.324 --> 49:09.323
I will leave without you.

49:23.938 --> 49:25.868
He's a menace.

49:25.878 --> 49:27.876
She's a tyrant.

49:27.876 --> 49:29.815
He has no sense of humility.

49:29.806 --> 49:33.904
She has eyes that look
right through you, like a shark.

49:33.914 --> 49:36.453
What a pair they are.

49:36.443 --> 49:39.743
If we don't do something,
they will ruin this war for us.

49:44.220 --> 49:46.590
Oh, I'm so happy.

49:46.590 --> 49:48.259
Tom is home.

49:48.259 --> 49:50.729
But, Alice, he's injured.

49:50.729 --> 49:53.497
He's struggling to recover,
so we mustn't expect too much.

49:53.487 --> 49:56.916
When can I see him?
We must make our plans.

49:56.926 --> 49:59.525
What plans?

49:59.525 --> 50:01.225
Wedding plans.

50:01.235 --> 50:04.133
Oh, you mustn't tell.
It's our deep, dark secret.

50:04.133 --> 50:06.133
Before tom went off
to the peninsula,

50:06.133 --> 50:08.772
we swore
our everlasting devotion

50:08.772 --> 50:10.841
and promised to be married.

50:10.841 --> 50:12.610
Married?

50:12.600 --> 50:15.030
Oh, tell me
you're happy for me, sister.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.679
You are, aren't you?

50:28.885 --> 50:31.684
Ah, forgive me, miss Phinney.

50:31.684 --> 50:34.583
The mccutchens have journeyed
all the way from Maine

50:34.583 --> 50:35.982
to see their boy, Teddy.

50:35.982 --> 50:39.011
They've not had a bed
for three days.

51:36.661 --> 51:40.200
Did you get something to eat?

51:40.190 --> 51:41.788
Yes, I did.

51:47.127 --> 51:49.796
I'm sorry.

51:49.796 --> 51:51.696
I failed you.

51:54.006 --> 51:57.104
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Squivers.

51:59.103 --> 52:01.503
Thank you, nurse Mary.
