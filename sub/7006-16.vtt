00:01.184 --> 00:04.551
- Does everybody know what time it is?
<i>- Tool Time!</i>

00:04.621 --> 00:10.082
That's right. Binford Tools is proud to
present Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor! Whoo!

00:15.866 --> 00:20.599
Ah! Thank you, Heidi. Thank you,
everyone. Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:20.670 --> 00:25.437
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.
You know my assistant, Al Borland.

00:28.912 --> 00:33.144
Well, welcome to remodeling week
here on <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:33.216 --> 00:36.151
Today we're gonna show you
space-saving items around the home,

00:36.219 --> 00:39.188
like this clever little clap rack.

00:44.628 --> 00:47.529
All right, let's start
over here at the kitchen counter.

00:47.597 --> 00:52.660
No better way to save space than utilize
it well. Under-counter recycling bins.

00:52.736 --> 00:56.797
And this narrow area is a great place
for a dispenser for aluminum,

00:56.873 --> 01:00.536
wax paper and plastic wrap.

01:00.610 --> 01:04.376
- And what about my special drawer?
- What is so special about this drawer?

01:04.447 --> 01:07.416
It's a drawer you can put stuff
you can't find any other place for.

01:07.517 --> 01:11.351
Like buttons and pins
that don't work, string, thimbles,

01:11.421 --> 01:13.855
you know, navel lint, rakes,

01:13.924 --> 01:17.587
brooms, skis, poles...

01:19.429 --> 01:21.795
There's even room for you in there, Al.

01:22.565 --> 01:24.328
I don't think so, Tim.

01:24.401 --> 01:28.303
All right. Now, this is a nifty idea.
This is a cooling unit in a drawer.

01:28.371 --> 01:31.204
Great for fruits and vegetables,
close to the cutting board.

01:31.274 --> 01:33.970
As well as your wine,
your beer, your vodka.

01:34.044 --> 01:37.605
And that extra liver you're going
to need for the transplant.

01:39.282 --> 01:41.842
Now, if you need
some extra space in the utility room,

01:41.952 --> 01:44.887
this unit is a washerldryer all in one.

01:44.955 --> 01:49.449
Oh! Finished your laundry, Al.
Oh, gosh darn it, I must've shrunk 'em.

01:50.460 --> 01:53.020
All right.
Now, over to the family unit here.

01:53.096 --> 01:56.554
Now, you can't possibly
tell me these are called briefs.

02:00.704 --> 02:04.572
How many flannels you have
to kill to get underwear this size?

02:09.713 --> 02:13.012
Well, this beautiful piece of furniture
can fit under a windowsill,

02:13.083 --> 02:15.847
and it can house
an entire entertainment system.

02:15.919 --> 02:19.355
Right. In Al's apartment, this is
where he hides his square-dance caller.

02:19.422 --> 02:22.949
It opens through the lid here,

02:23.026 --> 02:25.756
and a motorized unit brings
the TV up to eye level.

02:25.829 --> 02:30.766
Right. But the standard motor
is just a bit sluggish.

02:30.834 --> 02:33.735
- So l...
- Oh, you didn't soup up a TV counter?

02:33.803 --> 02:35.896
That way it'll just pop up quicker.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:39.002 --> 03:40.765
- Great show today, Tim.
- Thanks, Al.

03:40.837 --> 03:42.702
Aw, you didn't need
to get me a gift, Al.

03:42.772 --> 03:45.332
I didn't.
This is llene's Valentine present.

03:45.408 --> 03:48.741
We've been busy planning the wedding,
I almost forgot to buy something.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.246
Ah! One thing
The Tool Man never forgets

03:51.314 --> 03:54.010
is to buy the wife
a Valentine's Day present.

03:54.084 --> 03:56.382
Yeah, but you usually
end up doing it late

03:56.453 --> 04:00.981
and buying Jill a box of waxy
chocolates from the gas station.

04:01.057 --> 04:04.925
Oh, how little you know,
my funny little "Alentine."

04:06.396 --> 04:09.957
I bought Jill's gift this year in July.

04:10.066 --> 04:13.160
So they'll be waxy and stale?

04:14.070 --> 04:17.801
I didn't get chocolates. Found something
I knew she'd love, bought it on the spot

04:17.874 --> 04:19.307
because I knew I would forget.

04:19.375 --> 04:21.036
Yeah? What did you get her?

04:22.212 --> 04:23.679
I don't remember.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.277
You don't remember
what you bought?

04:26.382 --> 04:29.044
I will when I get it out
from where I hid it.

04:29.119 --> 04:32.247
- Yeah? Where'd you hide it?
- I don't remember.

04:33.323 --> 04:35.484
Hey, Tim,
you got a call while we were on the air.

04:35.592 --> 04:37.492
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.425
Excuse me.

04:40.763 --> 04:43.732
A woman named Liddy Talbot wants
to see me, says it's important.

04:43.833 --> 04:45.095
Who's Liddy Talbot?

04:45.168 --> 04:48.331
I went to high school
with a Talbot. Huh.

04:48.404 --> 04:52.864
Says she's in town for three days
singing at the Hotel Shipman.

04:52.942 --> 04:57.106
Wow! She looks you up after 25 years?
What do you think she wants?

04:57.180 --> 04:58.613
- I don't know.
- You know,

04:58.681 --> 05:01.548
last year a guy called me
out of the blue from high school.

05:01.618 --> 05:04.587
Seems he's had a crush
on me this whole time.

05:04.654 --> 05:07.179
Was his name Liddy Talbot?

05:08.491 --> 05:13.451
Ooh, maybe Liddy's
had a crush on you all these years.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.895
- She did say it was personal.
- Ooh!

05:15.965 --> 05:19.867
Maybe she's just left her husband
and wants to seduce you

05:19.936 --> 05:21.870
- with her feminine wiles.
- Yeah.

05:21.938 --> 05:25.101
Maybe you should cancel
that subscription to <i>Cosmo.</i>

05:32.081 --> 05:35.312
I'm going crazy. I don't know what
to get Lauren for Valentine's Day.

05:35.385 --> 05:38.548
I know
what I want to give Angela.

05:39.355 --> 05:42.813
Wow! The new Ferrari 456.

05:42.892 --> 05:45.554
Not a bad price: $200,000.

05:46.462 --> 05:48.430
That includes floor mats.

05:48.531 --> 05:52.627
Guys! Guys! Did you find
my Valentine's Day present for mom?

05:52.702 --> 05:57.469
No. It's kind of tough
to get motivated for a $2 reward.

05:57.540 --> 06:01.067
- Valentine's Day is not about money.
- Obviously not.

06:02.178 --> 06:04.078
Five bucks.

06:04.147 --> 06:06.581
Ten bucks. Forty bucks.

06:06.649 --> 06:09.379
Now, go find her
Valentine's Day present, all right?

06:10.653 --> 06:13.144
- Valentine's Day present?
- No.

06:13.223 --> 06:16.158
- What did you get me?
- I can't tell you.

06:17.427 --> 06:19.861
Believe me, I can't tell you.

06:22.365 --> 06:23.923
How was your day?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.333
Oh, pretty gosh darn weird.

06:27.403 --> 06:31.567
Got a phone message from a girl
I think I used to know in high school.

06:31.674 --> 06:34.336
And she told Heidi
that it was a personal matter.

06:34.410 --> 06:35.775
Ooh!

06:35.878 --> 06:39.041
Why is everyone doing that? "Ooh!"

06:39.115 --> 06:41.481
Well, let's see.

06:41.551 --> 06:44.452
She calls you
out of the blue after 25 years.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.353
- Mm-hm.
- She probably just got divorced,

06:47.423 --> 06:49.983
kids are grown,
she's feeling a little lonely.

06:50.059 --> 06:52.687
And she's thinking...

06:52.762 --> 06:56.289
"Maybe I should've
just settled for Tim after all."

06:59.936 --> 07:02.234
I like Al's answer better.

07:03.139 --> 07:05.699
Tell me some more about her.
What was her name?

07:05.775 --> 07:08.437
- Liddy Talbot.
- Liddy Talbot.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.844
Was she blonde, blue-eyed? Really...

07:11.914 --> 07:13.882
Bad arthritis?

07:16.319 --> 07:18.480
I don't even remember her.

07:18.588 --> 07:20.852
Well, let's look her up in the yearbook.

07:20.923 --> 07:24.689
You know, I'm thinking she probably
works for a big tool company, you know?

07:24.761 --> 07:27.423
One of those women
that sells arc welders.

07:27.497 --> 07:31.433
Tim, have you ever known
a woman who sold arc welders?

07:31.501 --> 07:34.834
No, but a guy can dream, can't he?

07:34.904 --> 07:37.532
R... S... T... Talbot. Talbot.

07:37.607 --> 07:41.475
Probably some mousy girl
with an overbite and thick glasses.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.842
Hello!

07:45.248 --> 07:47.409
She's beautiful!

07:47.517 --> 07:50.486
I remember her. She was really hot.

07:50.553 --> 07:56.116
Look what it says. "Tim, I'll never
forget you." Woo-hoo-hoo!

07:57.460 --> 07:59.894
Maybe she does
have some sort of crush on me.

07:59.962 --> 08:03.125
I don't ever remember talking to her.
She was in none of my classes.

08:03.199 --> 08:06.862
Maybe you were in some
of the same clubs. Let's see.

08:06.936 --> 08:09.496
Honor Society,
Philosophy Club, Latin Scholars...

08:10.740 --> 08:12.298
I don't think so.

08:13.643 --> 08:17.204
Anything about being in the Future
Transmission Workers of America?

08:17.313 --> 08:19.645
Not according to this.

08:19.716 --> 08:22.276
Well, I don't think
I'm comfortable going to see her.

08:22.385 --> 08:25.548
Well, you have to go see her.
You have to find out what she wants.

08:25.655 --> 08:27.088
Yeah?

08:27.156 --> 08:30.922
Well, what if what she wants
is to take me away from you?

08:31.027 --> 08:34.724
Have her make an offer.
I'll take the weekend to think it over.

08:39.068 --> 08:40.729
Mmmm...

08:42.205 --> 08:43.933
Perfect Manhattan.

08:48.244 --> 08:50.178
Pretty big guitar for such a little guy.

08:50.246 --> 08:52.305
It's not a guitar.

08:52.382 --> 08:56.011
And if I'm a guy,
I'm paying way too much for shoes.

08:56.085 --> 08:58.645
- Sorry. Let me give you a hand.
- Oh, thank you.

08:58.755 --> 09:02.521
Oh, boy! So, you're with the band?

09:02.592 --> 09:05.152
Uh, yeah. What gave it away?

09:05.928 --> 09:09.261
- I'm here to see Liddy Talbot.
- Oh, me too.

09:09.332 --> 09:12.597
- I'm the replacement bass player.
- What happened to the first one?

09:12.668 --> 09:14.499
- Hernia.
- Oh!

09:19.609 --> 09:22.169
Let me get you a drink.
What's your poison?

09:22.245 --> 09:25.214
Middle-aged drummers.
But I'll take a ginger ale.

09:25.314 --> 09:27.373
- OK. A ginger ale for...?
- Tina.

09:27.450 --> 09:29.350
- Tina. Tim Taylor.
- How're you doing?

09:29.419 --> 09:30.443
- Thank you.
- Good.

09:30.520 --> 09:34.752
- Why are you waitin' for Liddy?
- Um, we went to high school together.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.521
Haven't seen her in 25 years, and
all of a sudden she gets a hold of me.

09:38.594 --> 09:40.528
Ooh!

09:44.767 --> 09:46.667
Wait a minute. That must be her.

09:46.736 --> 09:50.103
I'll give her the bad news I'm happily
married and then she's all yours.

09:51.307 --> 09:54.640
Liddy Talbot, you look great.
I'd know you anywhere.

09:57.713 --> 09:59.806
Well, almost anywhere.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.514
I'm Liddy Talbot.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.548
Liddy Talbot, of course.

10:05.621 --> 10:10.115
You look great. You were one
of the earlier birthdays in the class.

10:11.327 --> 10:13.488
I'm 25 years older than you are.

10:13.596 --> 10:15.689
Ah, they held you back. Yeah.

10:17.266 --> 10:19.826
Tim, you went to school
with my daughter Elizabeth.

10:19.902 --> 10:24.965
Ah! But you're the one
with the crush on me?

10:26.776 --> 10:28.266
How many drinks have you had?

10:29.278 --> 10:32.338
Not enough.
Another Manhattan, bartender!

10:32.415 --> 10:33.746
Make that two.

10:33.816 --> 10:36.546
Come on, Tim. Sit down.

10:36.619 --> 10:40.646
Now, the reason I looked you up was
because I was a friend of your father's.

10:40.723 --> 10:44.215
Oh! Oh, great!

10:44.293 --> 10:46.454
It's always nice
to meet people that knew Dad.

10:46.529 --> 10:49.430
Yes. Well, I knew him very well.
We used to go together.

10:49.499 --> 10:52.332
Before he met my mom?

10:52.401 --> 10:56.963
Oh, yes. And we kind of
kept in touch afterwards too.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.734
After he was married?

10:58.808 --> 11:01.038
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

11:01.110 --> 11:02.668
What's really to talk about...?

11:02.745 --> 11:07.409
Tim, your father changed my life

11:07.483 --> 11:11.385
- in a very profound way.
- No kidding.

11:11.454 --> 11:13.149
Well, you know...

11:16.692 --> 11:18.455
speaking of profound changes,

11:18.561 --> 11:21.325
this lobby, they changed it.
It used to be a nautical theme.

11:21.397 --> 11:23.365
- This hotel's got...
- About your father?

11:23.432 --> 11:26.799
- Enough with my father! It's just...
- I asked you here so I could talk.

11:26.869 --> 11:29.633
Let's talk. What about your daughter?
What is she doing?

11:29.739 --> 11:33.266
Liz, we used to call her. She was the
secretary treasurer of the <i>Latin Club.</i>

11:33.342 --> 11:36.106
I speak a little "atin-Lay" myself.

11:36.178 --> 11:39.875
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I hate to
interrupt high school sweethearts.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.816
But I'm your bass player,
and we're on in ten minutes.

11:42.885 --> 11:44.614
- I'll get the play list.
- Thank you.

11:44.687 --> 11:48.919
Tim, please stick around. I really
want to tell you all about this.

11:48.991 --> 11:52.757
- What are we opening with?
<i>- Once I Had a Secret Love.</i>

11:54.363 --> 11:57.332
If it were up to me,
you should keep it a secret.

12:03.306 --> 12:07.436
Well, I just got 40 bucks richer.
I found Dad's gift for Mom.

12:07.510 --> 12:11.640
- Ooh, what is it?
- It's a locket with a picture of...

12:11.714 --> 12:12.806
Brad?

12:14.050 --> 12:16.780
What are you doing?
That's my Valentine's gift for Angela!

12:18.554 --> 12:21.284
If we put a picture of Mom in there
and tell Dad it's his gift,

12:21.357 --> 12:23.291
we can split the 40 bucks.

12:26.963 --> 12:30.455
- What happens to me and Angela?
- Not our problem.

12:31.801 --> 12:32.859
Hey, guys!

12:34.203 --> 12:36.034
Anybody find Mom's Valentine's gift?

12:36.105 --> 12:39.268
Well, we would have
if Brad wasn't so selfish.

12:42.178 --> 12:46.274
Oh, you're back soon.
I'm dying to know. How'd it go?

12:46.349 --> 12:48.078
- Please don't ask.
- Too late.

12:48.150 --> 12:51.677
You have to tell me everything. Is she
still cute? Does she still want you?

12:52.655 --> 12:55.317
Jill, Liddy Talbot
had an affair with my father.

12:55.391 --> 12:58.451
Your father had an affair
with a high-school girl?

12:59.595 --> 13:04.055
No! No! Liddy Talbot
is Elizabeth Talbot's mother.

13:04.133 --> 13:08.365
That's why she looked you up, to tell
you she had an affair with your father?

13:08.437 --> 13:10.337
She didn't come right out and say it.

13:10.406 --> 13:12.738
But I'm not an idiot.
All the key words were there.

13:12.808 --> 13:14.673
They used to "go together."

13:14.744 --> 13:18.043
After he was married,
they used to keep in "touch."

13:18.581 --> 13:23.348
This is so shocking! Your father
had an affair that nobody knew about?

13:23.419 --> 13:26.582
I can't believe it. It's
like something out of a romance novel.

13:28.591 --> 13:31.890
Where do you think they
had these secret little trysts?

13:31.961 --> 13:35.124
You know, Jill,
I didn't think to ask.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.026
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

13:39.101 --> 13:41.467
What if Liddy and your father
had a love child?!

13:41.537 --> 13:42.537
Would you stop it!

13:42.605 --> 13:45.904
You were saying how hot Elizabeth was.
What if she's your sister?

13:45.975 --> 13:47.738
Now I want to vomit!

13:49.912 --> 13:52.437
What if you had
married her instead of me?

13:52.515 --> 13:53.675
Would you let this go?

13:53.749 --> 13:56.718
What if you and your half-sister
had had children?

14:01.857 --> 14:05.122
Well, then I would be the best father
and uncle to those kids possible.

14:14.904 --> 14:17.737
- Hi-ho, neighbor.
- Hi, Wilson.

14:19.809 --> 14:24.143
Using a metal detector
at night in the middle of winter...

14:24.213 --> 14:28.582
You know, Tim, I'd be glad to help out
if you're having a cash flow problem.

14:30.853 --> 14:35.017
It's not about that.
I hid Jill's Valentine's present.

14:35.091 --> 14:38.788
I can't find it anywhere in the house,
so I thought maybe I buried it out here.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.493
What'd you get her? A bone?

14:45.735 --> 14:49.193
So how did the meeting go
with your alluring school chum?

14:49.271 --> 14:53.401
It was actually a meeting
with my school chum's mum.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.240
Apparently, she and my father
were very good friends.

14:56.345 --> 14:59.314
She was about to tell me they
had an affair and I just ran away.

14:59.415 --> 15:03.476
Well, I could see how painful it would
be for you to hear something like that.

15:03.552 --> 15:05.520
I know how much you idolized your dad.

15:05.588 --> 15:07.681
I spent my whole life
trying to be like him.

15:07.757 --> 15:11.523
Well, Tim, there's nothing wrong
with modeling your life after someone.

15:11.627 --> 15:15.358
But it is dangerous to try to live up
to an ideal that can't possibly exist.

15:15.431 --> 15:17.092
What are you saying?

15:17.166 --> 15:20.135
I think it's important you think
of your father as a human being

15:20.236 --> 15:23.103
with flaws like everybody else.

15:23.172 --> 15:26.335
You know, I'm reminded of the
English statesman, Oliver Cromwell,

15:26.442 --> 15:30.879
who told an artist, "I want
my picture painted, warts and all."

15:30.946 --> 15:33.380
My dad didn't have any warts.

15:34.216 --> 15:37.379
He just had a big scar on his neck
where I shot him with a staple gun.

15:40.623 --> 15:42.887
If you don't find out
the truth about your father,

15:42.958 --> 15:45.426
you may spend your life
wondering who he was.

15:45.494 --> 15:48.395
Maybe I should
go back down to that hotel.

15:49.999 --> 15:51.523
<i>Ah!</i>

15:51.600 --> 15:53.465
Sounds like you found Jill's present.

15:53.536 --> 15:57.996
No. This is just an area I bury stuff
I blow up so Jill won't find them.

16:01.744 --> 16:03.712
That's a curling iron there.

16:06.916 --> 16:08.474
Crock pot.

It's the drummer. I want him.

I just hope I can make it

17:21.924 --> 17:25.359
I'm so glad you came back, Tim.

17:25.426 --> 17:29.557
Well, Liddy, I did some thinking
about what you were trying to tell me.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.190
What I wouldn't let you. And l...

17:31.300 --> 17:36.397
I think it's time I heard the whole
story. Um, would you like a drink?

17:36.472 --> 17:40.033
- Oh, sure. Scotch and soda.
- Scotch and soda.

17:40.109 --> 17:41.770
You know, when I saw you last night,

17:41.844 --> 17:44.711
I just couldn't get over
how much you resembled your father.

17:44.780 --> 17:48.944
- Really?
- He was really a very special guy.

17:49.051 --> 17:51.383
Yeah, he was,

17:51.453 --> 17:54.354
which is why...

17:54.423 --> 17:57.551
Which is why this is so difficult.

18:01.263 --> 18:03.823
It's very, very tough for me...

18:03.933 --> 18:07.266
Could you put a lid
on that for a minute?

18:07.336 --> 18:08.394
Guys, take a break.

18:11.173 --> 18:15.803
Well, it's tough after so much time to
find out after my father was married

18:15.878 --> 18:18.711
- that he, you know...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:18.781 --> 18:23.548
Your father adored your mother. He
wouldn't even think of having an affair.

18:23.619 --> 18:25.484
An affair?! No way!

18:25.554 --> 18:28.648
No! No! Not my dad! No!

18:28.724 --> 18:31.488
Drinks for everybody, huh?

18:33.529 --> 18:36.692
Except for these two.
Mel, you're a married man.

18:36.765 --> 18:41.429
Tim, just sit down and let me
tell you why I looked you up, please.

18:42.638 --> 18:44.503
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What?

18:44.573 --> 18:46.541
Well, while I was dating your father,

18:46.608 --> 18:49.771
I broke up with him for a drummer.

18:49.845 --> 18:51.813
Drummers, they're bad news.

18:51.914 --> 18:53.848
So it would seem.

18:55.951 --> 18:59.580
Well, after we had Liz,
he just took off.

18:59.655 --> 19:02.215
Left me broke, stranded.

19:02.324 --> 19:04.451
Your father, bless his heart,

19:04.526 --> 19:08.087
gave me money so I could
buy a piano and start giving lessons.

19:08.197 --> 19:11.291
Wow! So he loaned
you money to help you out.

19:11.367 --> 19:17.306
Yeah. And by the time I
was able to repay him, he'd died.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.807
So then I saw you on TV yesterday,

19:19.875 --> 19:23.106
and I realized this
was my chance to settle up.

19:23.178 --> 19:25.510
This was a long time ago.
It was between you and him.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.549
- Oh, no. Please.
- I can't take your money.

19:27.649 --> 19:30.277
Tim! Tim!
It's very important to me.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.483
Well, you know, what's funny is
that my mom is moving back in town.

19:37.559 --> 19:39.288
Dad wanted her to have a china hutch.

19:39.361 --> 19:41.192
And maybe that's
what I'll use this for.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.753
That's a great idea.

19:42.831 --> 19:46.597
Um, buy it, don't build it.

19:49.371 --> 19:52.135
I saw yesterday's <i>Tool Time.</i>

19:54.743 --> 19:57.405
Well, gotta get back to work.

19:57.479 --> 19:59.413

19:59.481 --> 20:02.939
Me too. Oh, do you have any requests?

Is she gonna wear
that flannel nightie on your honeymoon?

21:01.110 --> 21:03.476
Wouldn't you like to know?

21:04.980 --> 21:07.005
No.

21:07.082 --> 21:08.982
Just being polite, Al.

21:09.051 --> 21:11.781
- Did you ever find Jill's present?
- No, I didn't.

21:11.854 --> 21:14.982
I had to get her a chocolate tanker
truck from the Exxon station.

21:15.057 --> 21:17.355
- Guys, we're on.
- All right. Thanks.

21:18.994 --> 21:21.519
Hi. Welcome back
to remodeling week here on <i>Tool Time.</i>

21:21.597 --> 21:23.827
Right. Next,
we're going to strip the paint off

21:23.899 --> 21:26.129
this beautiful old lrish cupboard.

21:26.201 --> 21:28.931
And, of course,
we'll be using Binford paint stripper.

21:29.004 --> 21:32.269
Remember, it's very caustic so
you'll want to use goggles and gloves.

21:32.341 --> 21:35.504
That's right, Al. One thing
I like about this particular piece,

21:35.577 --> 21:38.444
it's got a real nifty
hidden drawer in here.

21:38.514 --> 21:41.074
You picked this up
when you were up in Petoskey, right?

21:41.183 --> 21:42.912
Yeah. Last July during the...

21:48.056 --> 21:52.186
Oh, look at this.
It's a beautiful hand-painted box.

21:53.295 --> 21:55.661
It's a one-of-a-kind antique jewelry box

21:55.731 --> 21:58.165
I bought for Valentine's Day
for my wife, and I hid it

21:58.233 --> 22:00.497
and couldn't find it.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.299
I think she's going to be
very happy with this. Can l...?

22:03.372 --> 22:04.703
Watch out!

22:16.218 --> 22:18.686
Don't have to worry
about her finding it now.

22:20.822 --> 22:24.758
Well, but on the upside,
it's got a real nice grain to it.
