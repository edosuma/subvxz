WEBVTT

00:06.750 --> 00:08.125
I need your oath.

00:08.708 --> 00:11.958
The first traces of a new ore.

00:12.333 --> 00:14.708
Elrond has been
very convincing in his assurances

00:14.791 --> 00:18.125
that Gil-galad bore no ill intent
when he sent him here.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.750
There is
something more at work.

00:19.875 --> 00:22.041
Go to Lindon. Find out what.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.666
You're off the Sea Guard!
All three of you!

00:25.750 --> 00:26.583
Enough!

00:26.666 --> 00:29.625
I just ruined my friends' lives,
shamed our family name.

00:30.958 --> 00:33.791
Go to the Men who have taken refuge
in the old watchtower.

00:34.291 --> 00:35.875
Deliver to them a message.

00:35.916 --> 00:39.166
That your people may live
if you forsake all claim to these lands

00:39.250 --> 00:40.875
and swear fealty to him.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.041
One day, our true king will return.

00:45.666 --> 00:49.375
I believe the man you hold
in your dungeons is the lost heir in exile

00:49.458 --> 00:51.250
to the throne of the Southlands.

00:51.916 --> 00:53.500
I call on you to fight with me...

00:53.583 --> 00:55.125
-I will serve!
-I will serve!

00:55.208 --> 00:57.666
...before Sauron
claims their lands for his own.

01:01.083 --> 01:04.125
You have lied, brought a dangerous
outsider into our midst.

01:07.375 --> 01:09.083
We're going to be left behind.

01:10.083 --> 01:11.666
This is how we keep up
with the others.

01:12.125 --> 01:14.208
He helps us, and... and we help him.

03:01.375 --> 03:04.333
My great thumb. My great thumb.

03:04.416 --> 03:06.250
No. Mi... Migration.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.833
Like, mi-gra-tion.

03:10.750 --> 03:14.041
Means, like, to move.
What we do, Harfoots.

03:14.125 --> 03:17.125
You see, we... we winter in Old Forest,

03:17.208 --> 03:21.208
and mid-summer, we make for Norfield Glen
to snail while the snailing's good.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.250
-"Snails, snails"?
-Snails, yeah.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.916
And at the first blush of the oak leaves,
we head to the Grove.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.625
A whole orchard,

03:28.708 --> 03:31.208
popping with bar apples, plums,

03:31.291 --> 03:33.708
apricots, carrots,
you'll... you'll love it.

03:36.125 --> 03:40.083
Of course, the only trouble is there's
a hundred perils between here and there.

03:43.666 --> 03:44.750
"Perils"?

03:45.375 --> 03:46.958
Like a danger.

03:47.041 --> 03:51.208
You know, big folk, wolves, fog, rain,

03:51.291 --> 03:55.750
hill-trolls, cave-trolls,
anything that'll kill ya.

03:57.750 --> 03:58.833
"Kill"?

04:00.333 --> 04:02.958
Means to make somethin' dead.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.958
I'm peril.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.750
No. No, no, you're not.

04:21.833 --> 04:24.000
-It's more...
-No. Fireflies.

04:24.583 --> 04:26.708
-That was just an accident. It's...

04:27.791 --> 04:29.333
You're not a peril.

04:30.291 --> 04:31.541
You're good.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.125
I'm good?

04:36.041 --> 04:40.208
You're good. Because you're here to help.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.833
Nori!

04:45.916 --> 04:48.333
Oh, great. Others should be ready by now.

04:49.708 --> 04:50.958
Quick sticks!

04:51.958 --> 04:54.541
Let's go. Come on.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.458
I... I'm...

05:00.375 --> 05:01.791
I'm good.

05:04.916 --> 05:06.541
Poke me with that crutch again,

05:06.625 --> 05:09.041
I'll pluck the hair off your toes
in your sleep.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.333
And I'll pluck off my ears
while you're at it.

05:11.416 --> 05:13.375
It'd save me listenin' to your snorin'.

05:13.458 --> 05:14.791
Oh, stuff. I do not snore.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.000
-Yes, you do.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.000
Come on, now.
Grove's not gonna migrate to us.

05:21.083 --> 05:25.083
Might help us move faster
if you sang us your mam's walking song.

05:25.166 --> 05:27.708
Yeah, go on, Pops, give us a warble.

05:27.791 --> 05:29.875
Oh, come on, it'll do us some good.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.375
-The sun is fast fallin'

05:36.458 --> 05:39.166
Beneath trees of stone

05:39.875 --> 05:42.916
The light in the tower

05:43.000 --> 05:46.041
No longer my home

05:46.125 --> 05:49.000
Past eyes of pale fire

05:49.375 --> 05:52.333
Black sand for my bed

05:52.416 --> 05:54.916
I trade all I've known

05:55.000 --> 05:59.333
For the unknown ahead

05:59.833 --> 06:05.000
Call to me
Call to me lands far away

06:05.791 --> 06:11.500
For I must now wander this wandering day

06:11.666 --> 06:14.625
Away I must wander

06:14.708 --> 06:18.333
This wandering day

06:19.166 --> 06:22.125
Of drink I have little

06:22.208 --> 06:25.041
And food I have less

06:25.125 --> 06:31.000
My strength tells me no
But the path demands yes

06:31.291 --> 06:37.291
My legs are so short
And the way is so long

06:37.375 --> 06:40.375
I've no rest nor comfort

06:40.458 --> 06:44.958
No comfort, but song

06:45.458 --> 06:50.833
Sing to me, sing to me
Lands far away

06:50.916 --> 06:56.750
Oh, rise up and guide me
This wandering day

06:56.833 --> 07:00.208
Please promise to find me

07:00.291 --> 07:04.291
-This wandering day

07:04.833 --> 07:08.291
-At last comes their answer

07:08.375 --> 07:11.083
Through cold and through frost

07:11.166 --> 07:16.791
That not all who wonder or wander are lost

07:17.458 --> 07:20.250
No matter the sorrow

07:20.333 --> 07:23.458
No matter the cost

07:23.541 --> 07:27.041
That not all who wonder

07:27.125 --> 07:31.083
Or wander are...

07:31.166 --> 07:36.166
Lost

08:37.166 --> 08:40.208
The tunnel is complete, my lord.

08:44.708 --> 08:48.208
Your arm. Show it to me.

08:57.583 --> 08:58.916
How does it feel?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.333
Like fire, Lord-father.

09:03.333 --> 09:07.000
I wish you could feel it like I do.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.000
For soon, it will be gone.

09:13.541 --> 09:17.916
And with it, the part of me
that knew its warmth as well.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.125
I shall miss it.

09:26.583 --> 09:29.583
Summon the legions. It is time.

10:02.708 --> 10:04.958
-Our enemy vows to attack.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.791
In exchange for mercy,

10:07.875 --> 10:10.583
we've been ordered to abandon this tower

10:10.666 --> 10:12.833
and swear fealty to their commander.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.875
I know I'm not the king you have awaited.

10:17.958 --> 10:20.958
But if you choose
to stand with me and fight,

10:21.041 --> 10:24.458
this tower will no longer
be a reminder of our frailty,

10:24.541 --> 10:26.791
but a symbol of our strength.

10:31.041 --> 10:32.625
Who will stand with me?

10:33.250 --> 10:36.666
Who among you will stand and fight?

10:45.791 --> 10:47.125
-Aye, let's do it.
-Aye.

10:48.291 --> 10:49.916
Stand and fight?

10:52.583 --> 10:54.166
Stand and fight?

10:54.875 --> 10:56.166
You will die.

10:57.500 --> 11:01.000
I say it'd be better to take our chances

11:01.083 --> 11:04.000
bowing to the supposed enemy.

11:04.083 --> 11:06.250
I have looked that enemy in the eye.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.750
He's not your deliverance.

11:08.833 --> 11:10.541
You think you are?

11:11.458 --> 11:12.791
Elf?

11:14.041 --> 11:16.458
I'll say this for our ancestors.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.500
They lived!

11:23.791 --> 11:26.125
Together, we can survive this.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.041
Follow me, and together, we will!

11:31.875 --> 11:32.708
Come on. Let's go.

11:32.791 --> 11:35.916
Come on. Follow me. Come on!

11:37.541 --> 11:39.000
-Come on!

11:39.083 --> 11:40.291
Follow me!

11:44.166 --> 11:45.250
Theo!

11:46.083 --> 11:49.250
It's our chance. It's our time. Come on.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.375
With me. Come on, lad. Follow me, lad.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.583
Right. Okay.
Give me a hand, will ya?

12:07.666 --> 12:09.166
Higher. Higher!

12:15.958 --> 12:18.333
-Enough for that run, lads.

12:23.458 --> 12:24.666
Ferry it out now.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.166
-Father.
-Isildur.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.583
May we speak?

12:37.375 --> 12:39.625
Why wasn't I chosen for the expedition?

12:39.708 --> 12:42.333
-Thought you were going west.
-Not anymore.

12:42.416 --> 12:44.791
Not till I've done something
worthy of Númenor.

12:45.958 --> 12:48.791
And what is that? In your words.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.083
I don't have words for it.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.500
That's why I'm trying so hard to find it.

12:55.416 --> 12:57.125
Why I'm asking for your help.

12:58.208 --> 12:59.625
Wish I could provide it.

12:59.708 --> 13:03.125
But we've far more volunteers
than we could ever hope to accommodate.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.458
Half the city wants a spot on those boats.

13:08.958 --> 13:10.625
Slip me to the front of the line.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.750
What are your qualifications?

13:15.833 --> 13:18.333
-"Qualifications"?
-Do you belong to the Sea Guard?

13:18.416 --> 13:21.958
-You know I'm twice the sailor...
-Do you belong to the Sea Guard?

13:22.666 --> 13:25.291
What about the Queen's Guard?
Merchant's Guild?

13:25.375 --> 13:26.666
-This is about uniform.
-Horseman's Guild?

13:26.750 --> 13:27.750
You're being absurd.

13:27.833 --> 13:30.750
While you were feigning fidelity
to the traditions of this isle,

13:30.833 --> 13:33.791
these men were living them.

13:35.291 --> 13:38.125
Finding ways to contribute. To serve.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.458
Something of which
you evidently care little.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.541
I care. I'm ready to serve.

13:48.916 --> 13:50.750
Nothing would make me prouder.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.291
But you had your chance.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.750
And you made your choice.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.750
-Risk Númenorean lives

14:04.833 --> 14:07.875
for some grimy Southlander
and a warmongering Elf?

14:07.958 --> 14:09.041
Consul Pharazôn!

14:09.125 --> 14:11.666
Why are you sending
our kinsmen off to die?

14:11.750 --> 14:14.666
-Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

14:17.416 --> 14:18.958
-Pharazôn!
-Come with me.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.833
Forgive me for not sending word
to you sooner. Been a trying week.

14:21.916 --> 14:23.333
Why didn't he stop this?

14:23.416 --> 14:25.666
-He's loyal to her. Rightly or...
-Wrongly.

14:25.791 --> 14:27.625
There are many who feel as you do.

14:27.708 --> 14:29.791
Not enough to sway him yet,
but given the right push...

14:29.875 --> 14:33.000
Then it must be you.
He will listen to you.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.500
When I speak, his ears close up.

14:41.625 --> 14:43.625
So speak louder.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.041
Oi, Southlander.

15:27.916 --> 15:29.375
You have visitors.

15:40.166 --> 15:42.333
And where did the enemy head next?

15:42.416 --> 15:46.125
Further south, I should think.
Towards the watchtower of Ostirith.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.833
I'll inform the Sea Guard.

15:55.458 --> 15:57.708
My thanks, Lord Halbrand.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.500
I'm certain your fellowship will prove
just as invaluable once we make landfall.

16:03.166 --> 16:04.333
"Landfall?"

16:04.916 --> 16:08.791
Galadriel informed us of your aspiration
to unite your people.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.250
Did she now?

16:11.333 --> 16:14.250
I trust she was not speaking in haste?

16:15.083 --> 16:16.958
As a matter of fact,
it was my intention...

16:17.041 --> 16:19.458
My companion is merely feeling
the weight of his task.

16:20.750 --> 16:24.958
I have no doubt, come time,
he will do his part.

16:27.250 --> 16:30.583
Given that I've staked my name upon it,
I should hope so.

16:31.333 --> 16:35.750
Queen Regent, your father
has requested your presence in the tower.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.416
"Galadriel informed us."

16:46.500 --> 16:49.750
I wondered how the queen knew
to waylay me at her father's bedside.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.458
It never occurred to me
you'd hand me over for a guild crest.

16:52.541 --> 16:56.291
You used me.
After I all but begged you to let me be.

16:56.375 --> 17:00.458
I have just convinced Númenor
to send five ships

17:00.541 --> 17:03.375
and 500 men to aid your people

17:03.958 --> 17:05.958
and place a crown upon your head.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.333
Many might assume you used me.

17:17.416 --> 17:19.083
Find another head to crown.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.375
I don't like it here.

17:33.458 --> 17:36.125
Oh, it's okay, Dil. It's just the trees.

17:36.208 --> 17:39.083
What madness made them go this way?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.833
Rockfoot Pass must be blocked in.

17:43.916 --> 17:47.333
Won't get any easier in the dark.
Keep movin'.

17:51.416 --> 17:53.166
"Easier in the dark."

18:13.125 --> 18:14.333
Wolves.

18:15.916 --> 18:19.000
Why don't you tell me
what's really goin' on?

18:19.083 --> 18:23.875
These woods have never been
this bare this time of year.

18:23.958 --> 18:25.416
It's as plain as lip fungus.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.791
He is responsible, isn't he?
The big fella.

18:27.875 --> 18:30.083
What precisely do you expect me
to do about it?

18:30.166 --> 18:32.416
What you ought
to have done at the camp.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.125
-Take their wheels and leave them!

18:35.208 --> 18:37.166
What's it gonna take?

18:37.833 --> 18:39.666
Make a widow of somebody?

18:39.958 --> 18:41.333
Or an orphan?

18:44.208 --> 18:45.791
People are gettin' hungry.

18:51.583 --> 18:53.000
Stay close.

18:56.958 --> 18:57.875
Hmm.

19:03.125 --> 19:07.083
Oh, this is very strange.
Most peculiar.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.500
Most peculiar.

19:14.583 --> 19:15.583
Oh!

19:21.750 --> 19:24.000
-You nearly caused my heart to burst.
-Malva.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.666
-We saw footprints.
-In the mud.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.125
-Lots of 'em!
-One at a time, please!

19:37.666 --> 19:39.416
-Run!

19:43.833 --> 19:44.666
-Come on! Run!

20:02.125 --> 20:03.250
Nori!

20:07.458 --> 20:10.708
Nori! Nori!

20:10.791 --> 20:12.458
Nori, get away from there!

20:14.416 --> 20:16.541
-Nori! Nori!

20:16.625 --> 20:17.625
No! It'll get you!

21:12.500 --> 21:14.416
Hold your ground, Ontamo.

21:14.916 --> 21:16.458
Make your father proud.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.333
Their strokes fall like the Stone-giants
of the North Moors.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.166
And yet?

21:24.875 --> 21:28.625
They are untested against this foe.

21:29.833 --> 21:33.958
Perhaps the Elf would be willing to offer
some instructions?

21:42.416 --> 21:44.500
There are many ways
to kill an Orc.

21:45.166 --> 21:48.125
But for you,
I will keep it strong and simple.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.458
Stab, twist, gut.

21:54.208 --> 21:55.416
Come at me.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.625
We will see who can score flesh.

21:58.708 --> 22:02.541
Anyone that does, I will promote...

22:06.125 --> 22:07.541
To lieutenant.

22:50.166 --> 22:53.166
Swordsmanship is about balance,
rather than strength.

22:53.250 --> 22:56.166
Fight with your feet. Not your arms.

23:15.041 --> 23:17.708
The Elf is fighting a soldier
in the square.

23:40.333 --> 23:41.416
Don't plant roots.

23:42.416 --> 23:43.833
-Keep moving.

24:06.250 --> 24:08.916
Never trust brute force to best an Orc.

24:12.708 --> 24:16.125
It's often easiest to outmaneuver them.

24:20.708 --> 24:22.875
Well done, Lieutenant.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.416
Never known a smith's aide
who could do that.

24:55.166 --> 24:56.791
It's not too late to stop this.

24:57.666 --> 25:00.666
Your cousin may hold the scepter,
but it's you the people follow.

25:00.750 --> 25:03.166
-With their help you could...
-Could what?

25:04.583 --> 25:06.333
Assert your influence.

25:06.416 --> 25:09.708
Sometimes the folly of youth is enough
to make an old man weep.

25:15.958 --> 25:18.375
Is it folly to try and stop a war?

25:19.333 --> 25:21.791
It's folly to kick against the current.

25:23.333 --> 25:25.916
You see, the tide may rise
and drown a man,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.833
or fall and sweep him out to sea.

25:28.916 --> 25:32.875
The trick of mastering the current
is to know which way it will turn next.

25:32.958 --> 25:35.333
You all but single-handedly
prevented our last king

25:35.416 --> 25:37.166
from dragging us back to the old ways.

25:37.250 --> 25:39.333
Don't tell me you couldn't
sway Míriel's mind now.

25:39.416 --> 25:42.583
And what makes you think Míriel's mind
and my own are not as one on this?

25:42.666 --> 25:45.791
Because my father would sooner die
than take orders from an Elf.

26:06.083 --> 26:07.708
"Orders from an Elf"?

26:16.875 --> 26:21.291
When all this has ended,
Elves will take orders from us.

26:22.625 --> 26:25.583
Now, my cousin can go to war
for Galadriel if she wishes.

26:26.375 --> 26:28.208
I go to war for Númenor.

26:28.291 --> 26:30.500
How could this be for Númenor?

26:32.333 --> 26:33.916
Have you learned nothing?

26:35.500 --> 26:37.958
Soon, we will save
the low men of Middle-earth,

26:38.375 --> 26:41.333
lift them up, and give them
the king they've long awaited.

26:41.875 --> 26:43.833
A king who will be forever in our debt.

26:45.250 --> 26:48.333
Now, contemplate, if you can,
how that might benefit us.

26:51.041 --> 26:54.541
Ores, forests, trades, tribute...

26:55.000 --> 26:57.958
I wouldn't dare stop that.
Not for all the salt in the sea.

26:59.125 --> 27:00.416
And neither should you.

27:10.875 --> 27:12.208
The kingdom!

27:12.291 --> 27:16.041
-The kingdom is in danger. I must...
-The danger has passed, Father.

27:17.125 --> 27:20.541
We are doing now
what you always believed we must.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.958
We're restoring our connection
with the Elves.

27:26.291 --> 27:28.166
I'm going to Middle-earth.

27:39.958 --> 27:40.958
Míriel?

27:42.083 --> 27:44.083
Yes, Father.

27:45.916 --> 27:47.000
It's me.

27:50.041 --> 27:53.791
Don't go to Middle-earth.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.125
All that awaits you there is...

28:01.833 --> 28:03.833
What, Father? What awaits me?

28:05.208 --> 28:06.625
Darkness.

28:13.541 --> 28:14.750
Can you believe it?

28:16.250 --> 28:18.500
Everyone's talkin'
about what you did.

28:22.125 --> 28:24.625
Never seen 'em take a shine
to an outsider like this before.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.625
Brought you some beeswax.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.708
Slather some on that paw,
should help with the tenderness.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.250
Hey.

29:08.875 --> 29:11.041
Stop. Please.

30:15.083 --> 30:18.458
To an enduring union
between our two great peoples,

30:18.541 --> 30:20.458
Khazad and Noldor.

30:20.541 --> 30:22.666
-To the union.
-To the union.

30:23.291 --> 30:25.708
Before our wines ascend,

30:26.166 --> 30:29.083
Lord Durin, I should like to commend you.

30:29.708 --> 30:33.166
Khazad-dûm has been called the quietest
of Dwarven kingdoms,

30:33.250 --> 30:37.041
but in recent months,
your furnaces are said to be burning

30:37.125 --> 30:40.583
as bright as the eyes of Aulë himself.

30:40.666 --> 30:42.875
Your mines delving ever deeper.

30:43.583 --> 30:47.708
To what do you credit
this new invigoration?

30:49.625 --> 30:51.625
I might ask the same of Lindon.

30:53.208 --> 30:56.833
Shipping off its warriors,
expandin' its cities.

30:58.416 --> 31:00.500
Bit sudden for Elves, no?

31:02.458 --> 31:05.333
Typically takes you people weeks
just to decide to take a sh...

31:05.416 --> 31:06.791
If I may...

31:08.250 --> 31:11.083
The hand of time crawls
so slowly for our kind.

31:11.583 --> 31:15.250
We often overlook the years of effort
we perceive as taking but a moment.

31:15.333 --> 31:18.166
In so doing, I would not wish
to offend our guest.

31:18.250 --> 31:21.500
I would think our Dwarven friend
far too stout of heart

31:21.583 --> 31:24.416
to be offended by an honest inquiry.

31:25.833 --> 31:28.541
I have an honest inquiry for you.

31:31.166 --> 31:34.250
From where did you procure the table?

31:35.500 --> 31:36.916
Why do you ask?

31:38.000 --> 31:41.583
This stone grows only at certain depths.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
So rarely do our resonators
locate a deposit.

31:45.833 --> 31:48.625
We consider each to be a precious gift.

31:50.583 --> 31:55.833
We reserve its use
for the most sacred purposes.

31:57.291 --> 32:00.291
Monuments or tombs,

32:01.541 --> 32:03.541
to our honored dead.

32:13.083 --> 32:15.916
Please forgive our sacrilege, Lord Durin.

32:17.041 --> 32:22.458
We shall have to send it home with you,
so it can be treated with proper respect.

32:26.833 --> 32:30.125
It's good to know there's still
some honor left among the Elves.

32:32.166 --> 32:33.250
Your Grace.

32:33.708 --> 32:37.166
To the union of our two peoples, then.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.416
To the union.

32:47.958 --> 32:51.375
Your loyalty to the Dwarf is admirable.

32:52.416 --> 32:55.166
Loyalty to a friend
ought to be expected.

32:55.250 --> 32:56.958
Regardless of his race.

32:57.041 --> 33:00.250
Does it justify lying to your king?

33:00.333 --> 33:03.375
I wonder, High King, if it is in fact you
who has been lying to me.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.958
I went to Khazad-dûm with a proposal
of friendship, but in truth,

33:12.666 --> 33:15.666
you sought something far more tangible,
didn't you?

33:15.750 --> 33:19.000
Are you familiar with
The Song of the Roots of Hithaeglir?

33:19.750 --> 33:21.833
-Recount it for me, please.

33:23.500 --> 33:26.833
An obscure legend regarded by most
to be a apocryphal.

33:26.916 --> 33:30.166
Recount it, Elrond  Peredhel.

33:33.958 --> 33:35.958
It speaks of a battle,

33:36.833 --> 33:39.000
high among the peaks
of the Misty Mountains.

33:40.291 --> 33:43.750
Not over honor or duty. But over a tree.

33:43.833 --> 33:47.083
Within which some claim
was hidden the last of the lost Silmarils.

34:00.583 --> 34:03.458
On one side,
fought an Elven warrior,

34:04.250 --> 34:06.208
with a heart as pure as Manwë,

34:06.291 --> 34:09.041
who poured all of his light
into the tree to protect it.

34:09.791 --> 34:12.416
-On the other, a Balrog of Morgoth,

34:12.500 --> 34:15.875
who channeled all his hatred
into the tree to destroy it.

34:16.583 --> 34:20.875
Amidst their duel unending,
lightning ensnared the tree...

34:24.125 --> 34:27.791
Forging of their conflict, a power...

34:28.708 --> 34:32.875
A power as pure and light as good.

34:32.958 --> 34:35.958
As strong and unyielding as evil.

34:36.958 --> 34:39.958
They say it seeped down the roots
into the mountain depths,

34:40.041 --> 34:44.041
where for centuries now, it has waited.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.583
Durin was right.

34:46.666 --> 34:49.000
Then you admit the Dwarves did find it.

34:49.083 --> 34:52.166
The ore containing the light
of the lost Silmaril.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.083
I admit only this.

34:54.166 --> 34:57.041
I promised Durin never
to reveal his people's secrets.

34:58.041 --> 35:00.916
And what if keeping
your promise to his people

35:01.666 --> 35:04.500
meant ensuring the doom of your own?

35:38.583 --> 35:42.875
We first took notice of it
just prior to Galadriel's return.

35:42.958 --> 35:44.750
We hoped that by sending her away,

35:44.833 --> 35:48.541
and so bringing an end
to the last vestiges of war,

35:48.625 --> 35:50.833
we might arrest the decay.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.750
But despite our every effort,

35:54.833 --> 35:57.750
our decline has only quickened.

35:58.625 --> 36:01.958
The blight upon this tree
is but an outer manifestation

36:02.041 --> 36:03.583
of an inner reality.

36:04.416 --> 36:06.583
That the light of the Eldar,

36:06.666 --> 36:10.083
our light, is fading.

36:12.875 --> 36:14.458
Who else knows about this?

36:15.041 --> 36:16.458
Precious few.

36:19.625 --> 36:22.750
I ask again, and for the last time,

36:24.500 --> 36:27.750
did the Dwarves find the ore or not?

36:32.333 --> 36:35.500
I swore an oath to Durin.

36:38.166 --> 36:42.166
To some, that may now hold little weight.

36:45.541 --> 36:47.125
But in my esteem,

36:48.000 --> 36:51.708
it is by such things
our very souls are bound.

36:52.500 --> 36:56.833
I do not intend to let mine slip away
on the basis of mere hope.

36:58.333 --> 37:02.500
Hope is never mere, Elrond...

37:03.666 --> 37:05.500
even when it is meager.

37:06.666 --> 37:09.041
When all other senses sleep,

37:09.125 --> 37:13.416
the eye of hope is first to awaken,
last to shut.

37:15.541 --> 37:19.000
If the Elves abandon Middle-earth now,

37:19.791 --> 37:24.458
the armies of darkness will march
over the face of the earth.

37:24.541 --> 37:25.791
It will be the end,

37:25.875 --> 37:30.000
not just of our people, but all peoples.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.583
If the hope of preventing
that is not reason enough

37:34.666 --> 37:37.125
to make you reconsider your oath,

37:38.125 --> 37:40.125
I suggest you find another.

38:07.625 --> 38:10.666
What was the land immortal hands

38:10.750 --> 38:14.000
Rose up from Sundering Sea?

38:14.083 --> 38:17.416
-Land of the gift, land of the star

38:17.500 --> 38:20.916
To shine eternally?

38:21.000 --> 38:24.458
'Twas Númenor
Fair Númenor

38:24.541 --> 38:27.875
Bright isle filled with grace...

38:29.250 --> 38:32.083
I said it won't be dangerous.

38:32.166 --> 38:35.041
I wager it'll all be over
by the time I get off the boat.

38:35.125 --> 38:36.500
Just don't tell my father.

38:36.583 --> 38:40.500
He keeps crowing to everyone with ears,
his future son-in-law's a war hero.

38:41.166 --> 38:43.166
Sing! Come on, sing.

38:43.250 --> 38:44.958
You remember the words, don't you?

38:45.041 --> 38:48.000
After hearing you squawk them all night,
I fear I'll never forget them.

38:49.125 --> 38:52.541
Perhaps Isildur will sing with you.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.708
Oh, bless our every breath...

38:55.166 --> 38:57.083
This should be interesting.

38:57.166 --> 38:59.875
Make our great land to ever stand

38:59.958 --> 39:02.125
Our swords to conquer death

39:02.208 --> 39:05.083
-The answer's no.
-I haven't said anything yet.

39:05.166 --> 39:06.375
I've known you 15 years.

39:06.458 --> 39:08.291
You think I don't know
what you're here to say?

39:08.375 --> 39:11.208
-It's actually 16, but I mean...
-Ontamo.

39:11.291 --> 39:13.750
Right. What have I come to say?

39:13.833 --> 39:16.458
A fairly lavish apology,
which Ontamo, of course,

39:16.541 --> 39:17.875
would've accepted instantly,

39:17.958 --> 39:19.000
-but I wouldn't have.

39:19.083 --> 39:20.583
And do you know why?

39:21.541 --> 39:25.625
You're only apologizing because you think
now that I've been promoted,

39:25.708 --> 39:27.541
I can get you on the expedition.

39:31.958 --> 39:33.416
-Can you?
-Right.

39:35.583 --> 39:38.166
I'd just like to say,
I wouldn't have accepted instantly.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.166
-But I am glad that you apologized.
-No, he didn't.

39:40.250 --> 39:41.541
I did!

39:41.625 --> 39:44.625
But I'll gladly do it again.
I'm sorry I started the fight.

39:46.708 --> 39:48.458
Now please bring me with you.

39:49.625 --> 39:50.833
No.

39:53.250 --> 39:55.333
What'll it take
to make this right?

39:56.458 --> 39:57.875
Fine, you get a free hit.

39:58.666 --> 40:01.375
Jaw, gut, your choice. One hit.

40:04.250 --> 40:05.083
Three.

40:05.166 --> 40:06.708
Uh, two.

40:08.416 --> 40:09.541
-Actually...

40:13.916 --> 40:15.250
That felt like three.

40:20.916 --> 40:23.250
So, you'll bring me on the ship?

40:24.208 --> 40:27.208
Isildur, you're my oldest friend.

40:28.875 --> 40:32.000
And if you want to know the truth,
you're probably still my best, but...

40:32.083 --> 40:33.583
-What?
-Ontamo, please.

40:34.625 --> 40:37.000
I can't, in good conscience, stake my name

40:37.083 --> 40:40.166
recommending you for a duty
that you might well decide to abandon.

40:40.250 --> 40:42.375
-It'll be different this time.
-Hmm.

40:44.208 --> 40:45.875
One day, I hope it will be.

40:47.625 --> 40:50.333
One day, I hope you find something

40:50.416 --> 40:52.750
that you would be willing
to sacrifice anything for.

40:55.833 --> 40:58.333
I'll take care of Berek for you.
I promise.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.083
Berek's going?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.833
The horsemaster recruited him.

41:04.333 --> 41:07.750
Sorry, Isil. The sea is always right.

41:57.166 --> 42:00.000
Are you stowing away?

42:08.250 --> 42:09.875
Are you about to burn the boat?

42:09.958 --> 42:12.875
Get out of here this moment.
I won't let anyone know I saw you.

42:13.750 --> 42:16.208
-Hand me the lantern.
-Don't.

42:16.291 --> 42:17.875
-Give it.

42:51.416 --> 42:53.416
Gather every hand. Hurry!

42:54.500 --> 42:56.541
Get them out. Quickly.

42:57.625 --> 42:59.625
Get them out! Isildur?

43:08.333 --> 43:09.500
Isildur?

43:11.750 --> 43:12.708
What happened?

43:13.416 --> 43:15.833
He was in a fishing boat.
A cask must've gone up.

43:15.916 --> 43:17.833
-A cask?

43:19.916 --> 43:21.916
He saved my life.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.583
He could've just left,
but he saved my life.

43:24.666 --> 43:25.916
Captain!

43:42.500 --> 43:45.333
We have reason
to suspect a passing brigand,

43:45.416 --> 43:47.333
but we've yet to identify him.

43:47.416 --> 43:51.000
We're fortunate we didn't lose
the rest of the ships as well.

43:51.083 --> 43:54.833
This was clearly an attempt
to kindle your doubts, Queen Regent.

43:54.916 --> 43:58.208
-Do not let it.
-I'm forced to disagree with the Elf.

43:58.291 --> 44:00.708
Perhaps we did act in haste.

44:00.791 --> 44:03.250
A kingdom should be led. Not dragged.

44:03.333 --> 44:05.125
I recommend we delay the voyage

44:05.208 --> 44:07.916
until we've had time enough
to win more hearts to your cause.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
Our enemy grows stronger every day.
Perhaps every hour we hesitate.

44:12.083 --> 44:15.375
Remember why you chose this path.
Remember your faith.

44:15.458 --> 44:17.583
Do you think I could forget?

44:18.083 --> 44:22.541
We still have three ships.
And your father's blessing.

44:26.375 --> 44:27.958
What of Lord Halbrand?

44:28.791 --> 44:30.291
He awaits our departure.

44:30.375 --> 44:31.791
I'm sure he does.

44:35.958 --> 44:38.041
Shall I tell the Sea Guard to stand down?

44:44.416 --> 44:48.458
This council will reconvene at first light
to make a final decision.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.833
See to it Lord Halbrand attends.

45:01.541 --> 45:03.125
What have you been
able to ascertain?

45:04.583 --> 45:06.000
Elrond, forgive me.

45:06.625 --> 45:07.875
Forgive you?

45:07.958 --> 45:09.333
That I did not tell you sooner.

45:14.250 --> 45:15.458
You knew.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.583
I begged him to allow you
into our confidence from the start,

45:19.666 --> 45:21.750
but the High King forbade it.

45:24.708 --> 45:27.125
And this... this  mithril...

45:29.291 --> 45:31.000
It is our only salvation?

45:31.083 --> 45:35.125
Elrond, I have tested it
under every duress.

45:36.291 --> 45:39.000
Nothing diminishes its light.

45:39.958 --> 45:44.458
We believe if we can secure
vast quantities of it quickly,

45:44.541 --> 45:49.958
enough to saturate every last Elf
in the light of the Valar once more...

45:52.625 --> 45:53.958
Then, yes.

45:55.500 --> 45:58.250
Yes. It very well could be.

46:08.166 --> 46:09.500
I am sorry.

46:11.500 --> 46:13.333
That the High King deceived me?

46:15.250 --> 46:18.750
Or that now our people are doomed
unless I break an oath?

46:20.541 --> 46:21.958
And betray a friend?

46:23.833 --> 46:29.250
I was there, Elrond,
the night your father set sail.

46:32.458 --> 46:37.291
A mortal man, who believed
he could convince the very Gods

46:39.041 --> 46:40.916
to come to war in our aid.

46:42.916 --> 46:46.208
I heard your mother
pleading with him not to go,

46:46.291 --> 46:50.125
asking him, imploring him, why,
why must it be him?

46:52.375 --> 46:54.125
And do you know what he said?

46:59.541 --> 47:02.125
Because he was
the only one who could do it.

47:23.541 --> 47:25.791
I was wrong to use you.

47:26.875 --> 47:28.291
For that, I'm sorry.

47:30.583 --> 47:33.541
Tomorrow, the queen
will call you to audience.

47:33.625 --> 47:37.791
Your voice at that meeting may well decide
whether this mission stands or falls.

47:39.041 --> 47:41.791
-Help me.
-I think I've helped you quite enough.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.083
Then help yourself.

47:45.833 --> 47:48.750
Stop fighting me, and together,
let us fight them.

47:49.416 --> 47:53.750
Not so long ago, men like me
were fighting alongside them.

47:53.833 --> 47:55.500
Men like you. Not you, yourself.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.166
You're wrong.

48:07.333 --> 48:11.750
You don't know what I did
before I ended up on that raft.

48:16.583 --> 48:18.416
You don't know how I survived.

48:27.375 --> 48:28.875
How we all survived.

48:35.625 --> 48:38.458
And when these people discover it,
they will cast me out.

48:40.458 --> 48:41.666
So will you.

48:44.041 --> 48:48.666
Sometimes to find the light,
we must first touch the darkness.

48:52.458 --> 48:54.208
What do you know of darkness?

48:58.250 --> 49:00.083
Whose dagger was it, Galadriel?

49:01.083 --> 49:02.583
Who is it you lost?

49:03.833 --> 49:04.833
My brother.

49:05.500 --> 49:06.750
What happened to him?

49:06.833 --> 49:08.458
He was killed.

49:08.541 --> 49:10.791
In a place of darkness and despair.

49:10.875 --> 49:13.583
By servants of Sauron.
Is that enough for you?

49:13.666 --> 49:15.166
So this is about vengeance?

49:15.250 --> 49:17.625
One cannot satisfy thirst
by drinking seawater.

49:17.708 --> 49:20.250
Then what is it? Why do you keep fighting?

49:21.166 --> 49:24.416
You are asking me to go to the one place
that I swore never to return.

49:25.333 --> 49:27.625
The least you can do is tell me why.

49:29.375 --> 49:31.166
Why do you keep fighting?

49:31.250 --> 49:33.000
Because I cannot stop.

49:47.083 --> 49:49.375
The company I led mutinied against me.

49:51.750 --> 49:55.958
My closest friend conspired
with the king to exile me.

49:56.500 --> 50:00.375
And each of them acted as they did...

50:03.916 --> 50:06.666
Because I believe
they could no longer distinguish me...

50:08.208 --> 50:10.208
from the evil I was fighting.

50:16.166 --> 50:17.416
I'm sorry.

50:20.916 --> 50:22.250
For your brother.

50:23.458 --> 50:24.708
For all of it.

50:25.750 --> 50:27.000
I'm sorry.

50:28.333 --> 50:30.875
Your sorrow cannot ease my pain.

50:32.666 --> 50:35.166
And nor will a hammer and tongs
ease yours.

50:36.625 --> 50:39.416
There is no peace
to be found for you here.

50:39.500 --> 50:41.000
And nor for me.

50:41.125 --> 50:43.500
No lasting peace in any path,

50:43.583 --> 50:45.916
but that which lies across the sea.

50:47.583 --> 50:50.583
I have fought for centuries,
seeking to earn mine.

50:52.375 --> 50:54.083
This is how you earn yours.

51:14.333 --> 51:16.333
Long have I awaited this day.

51:17.666 --> 51:20.500
The day your kind would return at last,

51:21.458 --> 51:26.000
lift us up from the muck and the filth,

51:27.041 --> 51:30.958
to take our rightful place at your side.

51:33.041 --> 51:36.666
I pledge my undying service to you.

51:39.625 --> 51:43.250
I pledge my loyalty to Sauron.

52:03.958 --> 52:05.958
You are Sauron, are you not?

52:16.791 --> 52:18.583
Hey, hey... Wait...

52:22.041 --> 52:24.833
I'll serve you, then. Whoever you are.

52:37.625 --> 52:40.041
Only blood can bind.

52:48.708 --> 52:49.875
Waldreg?

52:58.333 --> 52:59.583
Waldreg...

53:02.208 --> 53:03.875
Waldreg, no.

53:05.125 --> 53:06.416
No.

53:07.791 --> 53:08.875
No.

53:10.791 --> 53:11.833
No.

53:13.083 --> 53:14.166
-No.

53:15.083 --> 53:16.166
No!

53:19.708 --> 53:21.416
Lift your aim next time.

53:24.375 --> 53:26.583
And don't be so afraid of the string.

53:27.250 --> 53:29.083
Why bother trying to teach me?

53:30.958 --> 53:33.666
Because it took me over 200 years

53:33.750 --> 53:37.416
to develop the bravery
that's keeping me standing here tonight.

53:38.791 --> 53:40.666
You found it in only 14.

53:41.250 --> 53:43.583
And we're going to need it
in the fight to come.

53:43.666 --> 53:46.041
All my life,
your kind has watched us.

53:46.125 --> 53:47.875
Counting every whisper.

53:48.666 --> 53:50.833
Every kitchen knife too sharp.

53:52.166 --> 53:54.666
We're all about to be buried
in this tower.

53:54.750 --> 53:56.541
So why be buried with us?

53:58.416 --> 54:01.250
Because in counting the whispers
and the knives,

54:01.333 --> 54:04.958
I've come to know the voices
and the hands of those behind them.

54:06.250 --> 54:07.750
Half of us just left.

54:08.833 --> 54:10.666
But half stayed.

54:12.125 --> 54:13.208
Including you.

54:19.833 --> 54:21.333
So lift your aim.

54:39.083 --> 54:41.083
There's something you don't know.

54:49.416 --> 54:51.083
I've seen this before.

55:39.041 --> 55:40.250
It is a key.

55:42.375 --> 55:46.875
Conjured by some forgotten craft
of the enemy, to enslave your ancestors.

55:46.958 --> 55:48.500
A key to what?

55:51.541 --> 55:53.291
I do not know.

55:53.375 --> 55:56.166
The enemy commander
spoke of becoming a god.

55:56.250 --> 55:58.916
Of giving the Orcs a home in these lands.

55:59.916 --> 56:02.583
But whatever his design,
this much is certain.

56:05.083 --> 56:08.291
Our enemy knows your son
has what he needs to enact it.

56:14.458 --> 56:15.666
How long?

56:17.208 --> 56:18.375
Days.

56:21.041 --> 56:22.458
Maybe hours.

56:27.416 --> 56:29.125
We can survive this, Bronwyn.

56:29.791 --> 56:31.208
There is a way.

56:32.791 --> 56:33.958
There must be.

56:37.666 --> 56:39.083
There is one.

56:40.333 --> 56:44.041
No! Bow to the enemy,
and you take away everything.

56:45.625 --> 56:47.625
From your son, and his sons after him.

56:49.333 --> 56:53.333
Your people have worked an entire age
to earn back their virtue.

56:54.041 --> 56:57.166
Would you undo it all
in just one moment of despair?

57:00.083 --> 57:02.083
There must be another way.

57:02.166 --> 57:04.666
Name it. I beg you.

57:10.166 --> 57:11.208
See?

57:12.708 --> 57:14.708
You were right to watch us.

57:16.041 --> 57:18.458
Because we are destined for the darkness.

57:20.208 --> 57:21.666
It's how we survive.

57:24.833 --> 57:26.416
Perhaps it's who we are.

57:28.333 --> 57:29.833
Who we will always be.

57:30.750 --> 57:35.375
There's far more at stake here
than just our lives.

57:36.750 --> 57:40.666
When Morgoth was at war,
whole continents sank.

57:40.875 --> 57:43.416
Who is to say what horrors
this might unleash,

57:43.500 --> 57:45.166
should our enemy obtain it?

57:45.250 --> 57:47.250
What power do we have to stop him?

57:47.875 --> 57:49.791
Look around. It's over.

57:49.875 --> 57:51.666
-Not yet.
-Soon enough.

57:53.416 --> 57:55.958
And when they march upon us,
this tower will fall.

58:13.875 --> 58:15.041
Nampat!

58:18.250 --> 58:19.166
Nampat!

58:22.333 --> 58:23.416
Nampat!

58:26.291 --> 58:27.458
Nampat!

58:30.458 --> 58:31.500
Nampat!

58:35.000 --> 58:36.125
Nampat!

58:59.791 --> 59:02.000
You made it up, didn't you?

59:02.083 --> 59:04.750
Disa's been wanting a new table
for years, so...

59:12.333 --> 59:14.083
Ah, come on, it's not that heavy.

59:14.166 --> 59:17.166
It is not the weight of the table
that burdens me.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.625
So why don't you come out with it?

59:19.708 --> 59:22.125
Because a burden shared
may either be halved or doubled.

59:22.208 --> 59:24.291
-Depending on the heart that receives it.

59:24.375 --> 59:28.750
Aulë's beard!
Enough with the quail sauce.

59:28.833 --> 59:31.791
Give me the meat, and give it to me raw.

59:37.541 --> 59:39.958
I have not been truthful with you, Durin.

59:41.916 --> 59:44.791
I did not come to Khazad-dûm
for friendship, but ambition.

59:46.291 --> 59:47.791
I did not know it.

59:50.250 --> 59:51.916
But I came for  mithril.

59:58.041 --> 59:59.291
Why?

1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:02.416
Without it,

1:00:03.500 --> 1:00:07.916
my kind must either abandon these shores
by spring, or perish.

1:00:09.791 --> 1:00:11.041
Perish?

1:00:12.500 --> 1:00:14.166
Perish how?

1:00:16.166 --> 1:00:21.833
Our immortal souls
will dwindle into nothing,

1:00:23.541 --> 1:00:25.166
slowly diminishing,

1:00:26.166 --> 1:00:27.833
until we are but shadows,

1:00:29.208 --> 1:00:31.916
swept away by the tides of time.

1:00:33.750 --> 1:00:35.000
Forever.

1:00:48.958 --> 1:00:54.708
So the fate of the entire Elven race
is in my hands?

1:00:55.708 --> 1:00:57.416
So it would appear.

1:01:03.625 --> 1:01:05.333
Say that again.

1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:11.333
The fate of the entire Elven race
is in your hands.

1:01:20.041 --> 1:01:21.458
Whose hands?

1:01:23.750 --> 1:01:25.166
Yours.

1:01:27.500 --> 1:01:28.541
Hmm.

1:01:40.416 --> 1:01:43.541
Fetch your feathery shirts.
Let's start walking.

1:01:43.625 --> 1:01:46.000
-Durin...
-Don't thank me yet.

1:01:46.083 --> 1:01:48.833
Thank me after we find a way
to convince my father.

1:01:48.916 --> 1:01:51.125
Now can we please get moving?

1:01:51.208 --> 1:01:53.041
It's a long journey back.

1:01:53.125 --> 1:01:56.083
And all this sunlight is startin'
to give me a sour stomach.

1:01:56.708 --> 1:02:00.291
Under one condition.
Tell Disa the table's from me.

1:02:00.375 --> 1:02:02.125
Don't push your luck, Elf.

1:02:22.833 --> 1:02:25.666
Lord Halbrand,
the Queen Regent summons you.

1:04:35.250 --> 1:04:38.250
Look whose father
secured him a post. Again.

1:04:40.333 --> 1:04:42.208
I earned mine. Same as you.

1:04:42.291 --> 1:04:43.500
Soldier.

1:04:46.750 --> 1:04:48.333
Report to the horsemaster.

1:04:49.708 --> 1:04:51.208
Thought I was in cavalry.

1:04:51.291 --> 1:04:52.625
You are.

1:04:55.958 --> 1:04:57.208
Stable sweep.

1:05:16.791 --> 1:05:17.625
Soldiers!

1:06:06.708 --> 1:06:08.000
Clear the lines!

1:06:08.666 --> 1:06:10.166
Square the sail!

1:06:10.583 --> 1:06:12.250
We head nor'-east.

1:06:13.958 --> 1:06:15.208
For Middle-earth.

1:06:16.791 --> 1:06:18.000
Yes!

1:07:10.583 --> 1:07:13.750
The sun is fast falling

1:07:13.833 --> 1:07:16.708
Beneath trees of stone

1:07:17.208 --> 1:07:20.083
The light in the tower

1:07:20.166 --> 1:07:23.291
No longer my home

1:07:23.375 --> 1:07:26.083
Past eyes of pale fire

1:07:26.166 --> 1:07:29.250
Black sand for my bed

1:07:29.333 --> 1:07:31.875
I trade all I've known

1:07:31.958 --> 1:07:36.125
For the unknown ahead

1:07:36.500 --> 1:07:41.875
Call to me
Call to me lands far away

1:07:41.958 --> 1:07:47.625
For I must now wander this wandering day

1:07:47.708 --> 1:07:50.458
Away I must wander

1:07:50.541 --> 1:07:54.166
This wandering day

1:07:55.083 --> 1:07:57.416
Of drink I have little

1:07:57.500 --> 1:08:00.625
And food I have less

1:08:00.875 --> 1:08:06.250
My strength tells me no
But the path demands yes

1:08:06.333 --> 1:08:12.125
My legs are so short
And the way is so long

1:08:12.208 --> 1:08:15.166
I've no rest nor comfort

1:08:15.250 --> 1:08:19.000
No comfort, but song

1:08:19.958 --> 1:08:25.666
Sing to me, sing to me
Lands far away

1:08:25.750 --> 1:08:31.250
Oh, rise up and guide me
This wandering day

1:08:31.333 --> 1:08:34.166
Please promise to find me

1:08:34.250 --> 1:08:37.958
This wandering day

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.750
At last comes their answer

1:08:41.833 --> 1:08:44.833
Through cold and through frost

1:08:44.916 --> 1:08:50.708
That not all who wonder or wander are lost

1:08:50.791 --> 1:08:53.583
No matter the sorrow

1:08:53.666 --> 1:08:56.666
No matter the cost

1:08:56.750 --> 1:08:59.666
That not all who wonder

1:08:59.750 --> 1:09:03.833
Or wander are...

1:09:03.916 --> 1:09:09.708
Lost
