00:09.183 --> 00:11.315
- Hey, mirror.
Do my lips look kissable?

00:12.534 --> 00:14.014
Is it my face
that's holding me back?

00:15.319 --> 00:17.278
Beauty influencer
Dillin Jeremy!

00:17.321 --> 00:18.844
Is that really you?!
- No, Annie.

00:18.888 --> 00:22.370
I'm a targeted AI brought to you
by Cover That Girl makeup.

00:22.413 --> 00:25.503
Our eavesdropping algorithm
tells me you're feeling insecure

00:25.547 --> 00:27.288
and are likely to make
an impulse purchase?

00:27.331 --> 00:28.854
- That's true!

00:28.898 --> 00:32.423
- Let's cover up that homely
loneliness with sex appeal.

00:32.467 --> 00:35.209
Simply accept the terms.
- Oh, okay.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.646
- You've purchased
our wet look tutorial.

00:37.689 --> 00:38.995
Maximum drip!

00:43.130 --> 00:45.393
- Annie. Why do you look like
a melted gummy bear?

00:45.436 --> 00:49.049
- Are you trying to attract
boys...or dryer lint?

00:49.092 --> 00:51.268
- Boy-- Oh.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.966
- Your face is really
drippin' on the floor here!

00:54.010 --> 00:55.185
- Geez. Sorry.

00:55.229 --> 00:58.101
I tried a wet makeup look,
but it's useless.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.843
I'll never have a boyfriend.
- Aww, kid.

01:00.886 --> 01:04.020
That's just what I thought
when <i>I</i> was your age.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.413
And I was right!

01:05.456 --> 01:10.200
Not one boyfriend ever!

01:41.188 --> 01:43.755
Was that any good?

01:43.799 --> 01:48.847
- So, what's the main takeaway
from our electoral college unit?

01:48.891 --> 01:52.329
- Women are not suited
for higher office.

01:52.373 --> 01:54.375
- Oh, we have
a new student today!

01:54.418 --> 01:57.204
Meet your new classmate,
Kenton Burpy.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.558
Why don't you tell
the class about yourself

02:03.601 --> 02:05.603
while I take a little nap?
- Sure!

02:05.647 --> 02:09.955
Well, I was hit by a truck
filled with sand and <i>died.</i>

02:09.999 --> 02:12.175
Then I went to Heaven.
Then I came back!

02:12.219 --> 02:13.481
Then I moved to Fort Gator!

02:13.524 --> 02:15.439
- Ooh!
- Any questions?

02:15.483 --> 02:18.703
- Bet you went to Heaven
'cause you're a virgin.

02:18.747 --> 02:20.183
- Maybe I am.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.185
Or maybe that's just want
I wanted God to think.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.274
- Ooh!

02:24.318 --> 02:27.321
J.K.
I'm 100% virgin and proud.

02:27.364 --> 02:30.193
- Xenu does not approve!

02:30.237 --> 02:33.065
- I was already drenched,
but now I'm sopping.

02:33.109 --> 02:36.547
- Oh, boy. Yep, yep, yep.

02:40.029 --> 02:44.425
- Oh! It smells amazing in here!
You made my favorite!

02:44.468 --> 02:47.254
- Pickled smelt
and horsehair stew!

02:50.344 --> 02:53.129
Trophy, can you please do that
somewhere else?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.522
- No. I'm taking selfies
with the stew!

02:54.565 --> 02:57.699
They're called stewfies,
stew-pid! Keep up!

02:57.742 --> 02:59.918
- Aah!

02:59.962 --> 03:01.659
The stew is eating Shirty!

03:01.703 --> 03:05.054
Is there an emergency
shirt hotline we can call?!

03:05.097 --> 03:06.577
- I'll try the suicide hotline.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.579
There must be an extension
for shirts.

03:08.623 --> 03:11.756
- Stay with me, Shirty!
Stay with me, Shirty!

03:11.800 --> 03:13.671
Look at me! Look at me, Shirty!

03:17.762 --> 03:20.330
- Oh, no! Shirt-y-y-y-y!

03:20.374 --> 03:21.853
- Petey. Try calm down.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.769
I know Shirty give you feeling
of safety and security,

03:24.813 --> 03:26.162
but Baba here for you.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.165
Remember when you little boy?

03:30.514 --> 03:32.124
- Baba! Did Timmy's mommy call?

03:32.168 --> 03:34.910
He was supposed to come over
and fly kites this morning!

03:36.390 --> 03:39.088
- Why is Timmy sleeping
in the dead-person basement?

03:39.131 --> 03:40.524
- Timmy fly kite into traffic.

03:40.568 --> 03:46.138
Okay. Baba help you
process feelings of loss.

03:46.182 --> 03:49.490
Here. Go to sleep.
Like a bird!

03:57.976 --> 04:01.066
Baba, you're gonna have to
cancel the Lemonham funeral.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.546
Without Shirty, I'm not sure

04:02.590 --> 04:05.462
when I'll be able to resume
my duties as undertaker.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.334
- Just put on another shirt!

04:07.377 --> 04:09.161
- I have no other shirt!

04:09.205 --> 04:12.164
Shirty met all my needs,
if you know what I mean.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.384
<i>All</i> my needs.
- Ew!

04:14.428 --> 04:17.300
- I don't know why you
turn to shirt for comfort

04:17.344 --> 04:20.085
instead of finding
fertile woman your own age.

04:20.129 --> 04:22.392
- Because he has separation
anxiety! Which is your fault.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.307
- Huh. I always thought
it Shirty's fault.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.570
- Pete's never going to grow up

04:26.614 --> 04:30.008
unless you push him
out of his comfort zone.

04:30.052 --> 04:33.925
- I'll have you know even my
comfort zone is uncomfortable.

04:33.969 --> 04:37.146
- Trophy <i>terrible</i> mother,
but she right.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.409
Time to snip-snip apron strings.

04:39.453 --> 04:43.500
Pete, you go to mall and
pick out new shirt yourself!

04:43.544 --> 04:45.415
- You know I can't drive
without Shirty!

04:45.459 --> 04:48.157
Okay. Baba drive you.

04:51.073 --> 04:54.424
- Every time I see him,
my libido gets born again.

04:54.468 --> 04:57.122
- If it gets born one more time,

04:57.166 --> 04:59.342
I'm gonna need a bigger mop!

04:59.386 --> 05:01.126
- To prepare you
for Friday's genetics quiz,

05:01.170 --> 05:04.129
today we're going to watch
some of my old home movies

05:04.173 --> 05:06.306
and boo when my mother
comes on screen.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.959
- Hey, Kenton.
I was wondering.

05:08.003 --> 05:11.485
Are there boyfriends in Heaven?
- Hm. I'm not sure.

05:11.528 --> 05:15.140
But I did get to play two-on-two
basketball with the Steves --

05:15.184 --> 05:17.360
Jobs, McQueen, <i>and</i> Hawking.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.536
- Sounds like
a lot of two-way fun.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.233
I wouldn't know about that.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.410
- We can change that. Right now.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.803
Let me borrow your hand
for a second.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.588
Here! Like the word of God,

05:27.631 --> 05:29.807
friendship bracelets
are meant to be shared!

05:29.851 --> 05:31.548
- The chafe of friendship.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.420
I never thought
it would happen to me.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.466
- Hey, me and my band, we're
chillin' at my place tonight.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.555
You should come chill.
Or whatever. No presh.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.383
- I'm feeling the presh,
but it's good presh.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.950
I-I like the presh.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.386
- Great! It's a date.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.083
- A date...

05:51.046 --> 05:53.701
- Mom! Mom! Guess what!
- No!

05:53.744 --> 05:56.399
I'm sick of hearing
about new ways to recycle.

05:56.443 --> 05:59.533
Throwing plastic in the trash
makes Mommy happy.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.882
- Something great happened!

06:00.925 --> 06:04.059
- You picked up
my use-as-needed pills?

06:04.102 --> 06:05.190
- Well, yes.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.454
- And a boy asked me out!

06:07.497 --> 06:10.413
- Wait. A <i>real</i> boy?

06:10.457 --> 06:12.197
Baba! Get in here!

06:12.241 --> 06:13.416
- Baba here.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.461
- Baba <i>been</i> here.

06:14.504 --> 06:17.289
- Annie's going on
her first date!

06:17.333 --> 06:19.596
- Trophy, remember when you 14?

06:19.640 --> 06:21.598
Baba come with you.

06:21.642 --> 06:24.209
First date, third handjob.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.689
- Aww!

06:25.733 --> 06:27.996
You actually did a lot
of the heavy lifting on that.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.650
- How else you learn?

06:29.693 --> 06:33.001
In old country, mother chaperone
daughter's first date.

06:33.044 --> 06:36.918
Is family tradition, like not
being able to afford college.

06:36.961 --> 06:40.225
- So, where we headed, Annie?
Behind the bleachers?

06:40.269 --> 06:43.359
Dog track? Dialysis center?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.013
- No offense,
but I'd rather go alone.

06:45.056 --> 06:48.408
I really like him, and you can
never act appropriately.

06:48.451 --> 06:49.713
- Sure I can!

06:49.757 --> 06:52.150
Just describe his penis to me
ahead of time,

06:52.194 --> 06:53.891
then I won't be tempted to peek.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.677
- Mom! It's not like that.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.506
He clinically died
for 30 minutes, went to Heaven,

06:59.549 --> 07:02.639
then came back on a mission
to tell people about God.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.641
I guess you guys have
the "previously dying" thing

07:04.685 --> 07:06.730
in common.
- Heaven's a lie, Annie.

07:06.774 --> 07:09.646
This guy's a liar.
A virgin liar.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.169
- I'm a virgin, too, ya know.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.258
- Not the way <i>you</i> ride bike.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.696
- Baba, I'm as ready
as I'll ever be!

07:15.739 --> 07:18.655
- Best of luck with handjob.
- Fine.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.831
I want him to think
I come from a good family.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.268
Can I at least tell him
you're a troubled teen

07:23.312 --> 07:24.661
whose soul I'm trying to save?

07:24.705 --> 07:26.924
- I can still pass
for a troubled teen.

07:26.968 --> 07:30.493
- Thanks. If I do lose
my virginity tonight,

07:30.537 --> 07:33.801
I'll be thinking of you
the <i>whole</i> time!

07:35.542 --> 07:37.239
- No!
- Hoopah!

07:37.282 --> 07:39.633
Okay.
I drive around parking lot.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.373
See you in 30 minute.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.506
- But how will I know
which shirt is "the one"

07:43.550 --> 07:46.901
without your passive acceptance
or glaring disapproval?

07:46.944 --> 07:49.730
- Snip-snip!
Ooh! Here jar of nickels.

07:49.773 --> 07:53.385
After you find shirt,
stop at powdered-milk store,

07:53.429 --> 07:55.866
buy two packet of chalk flavor!

07:55.910 --> 07:57.346
Wha-- Wait!

07:57.389 --> 08:00.305
Shoppers will think you incel
with concealed weapon.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.656
There.
Make the people feel safe.

08:11.055 --> 08:14.450
- Welcome to "Lids.
But for Shirts. America!"

08:14.494 --> 08:16.757
Let me know if you need help.
Uncle Pete.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.282
- I need a new shirt.
- Of course.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.545
This Vesper Cottondale's
a close match.

08:22.589 --> 08:23.851
Soft and dependable.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.983
You'll notice
the contrasting top button,

08:26.027 --> 08:28.551
the French placket,
a curved hemline,

08:28.595 --> 08:30.771
and rear darts
for a tailored fit!

08:30.814 --> 08:34.122
- This shirt's not giving me
that same, "I'll be okay

08:34.165 --> 08:36.646
even if Mom's
in the other room" feeling.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.256
- Completely understand!

08:38.300 --> 08:40.955
Try this one. Uncle Pete.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.739
- Let me ask you something.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.263
Would you be trying to sell me
this physical assault

08:45.307 --> 08:48.919
with a hem and a collar
if my mother was here?

08:48.963 --> 08:51.661
- I'm sorry?
- Yes, you should be sorry.

08:51.705 --> 08:55.578
Sorry for preying on vulnerable,
unaccompanied grown men!

08:55.622 --> 08:57.754
I'm taking my business
elsewhere!

08:57.798 --> 08:59.582
- Elsewhere closed early today!

08:59.626 --> 09:02.803
- Oh, no! Now what, Shirty?

09:02.846 --> 09:04.805
- Remember what
Baba always says.

09:04.848 --> 09:09.113
When God closes a shirt store,
he opens a shirt kiosk.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.725
- She is so wise!

09:11.768 --> 09:13.204
- We've got a shirtless
white male

09:13.248 --> 09:15.511
with a gun bulge in his pocket
headed towards

09:15.555 --> 09:17.600
the Me Love You Lawn Time
Garden Center.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.211
I'll investigate as soon
as I finish up with this

09:20.255 --> 09:24.128
doughy, salty subject
I've currently got in custody.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.695
Over.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.482
- Hey, Annie!
So glad you could stop by!

09:30.526 --> 09:33.007
Who's your friend?
- Kenton, this is my mom.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.313
Er -- Did I say "Mom"?
I meant "Moam."

09:35.357 --> 09:36.793
As in "my main moam."

09:36.837 --> 09:39.709
Like how guys say "main man."
Girls say "main moam."

09:39.753 --> 09:42.494
She's a troubled teen
I'm helping.

09:42.538 --> 09:43.974
- Very cool.

09:44.018 --> 09:46.803
Well, these are my bandmates
and fellow believers --

09:46.847 --> 09:49.589
Shayla, Dushane, and Deacon.

09:49.632 --> 09:50.894
- You're just in time!

09:50.938 --> 09:52.853
We're about to play
"All God's Critters

09:52.896 --> 09:56.030
Got a Place in the Choir"
on hand bells!

09:57.640 --> 09:59.773
- Whoa! This place is amazing!

09:59.816 --> 10:01.905
Look! A theater-sized
popcorn popper!

10:01.949 --> 10:03.907
- Yeah, my dad
sued the sand company

10:03.951 --> 10:05.866
that owned the sand truck
that ran me over.

10:05.909 --> 10:08.564
My parents would've gotten
even more money if I died

10:08.608 --> 10:09.783
and <i>didn't</i> come back to life.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.915
My dad mentions that -- a lot.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.614
- So ya kicked the bucket
then retrieved the bucket

10:14.657 --> 10:16.267
and put it back
where it was, huh?

10:16.311 --> 10:18.922
- Yeah, except I made
a tiny pit stop in between.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.795
A little place called...
Heaven.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.492
Lying sack of garbage.

10:23.535 --> 10:26.451
- Speaking of, you guys want
to play Seven Minutes in Heaven?

10:26.495 --> 10:29.759
Annie,
you and Kenton can go first.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.805
- Fine,
but it's against tradition.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.067
- I can't wait!

10:33.110 --> 10:35.722
- Maybe <i>you</i> can't,
but Heaven can.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.854
- Your arm's gonna get tired.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.552
Okay. We have seven minutes
to kill, possibly five.

10:40.596 --> 10:43.077
Any of you 18
and already have HPV?

10:43.120 --> 10:44.905
If so, I'll play.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.823
- It's Succatash and the Mer!
For your afternoon commute.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.389
We got traffic on the ones,
Weather on the What!

10:51.433 --> 10:53.914
Succatash. Call us up, win
some cash! Be caller number 9.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.393
Just answer
the question of the day.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.700
Call to play. It's Ladies Day!
Hey, ladies! Shopping!

10:57.744 --> 10:59.267
Let's open up the phones.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.617
- Ohh! Baba <i>love</i> shopping.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.887
- Welcome to "Shirts, Don't It?"

11:10.931 --> 11:12.759
- I'm Peter Fantasy!
I'm in desperate need

11:12.802 --> 11:14.195
of a shirt
and my mother's approval!

11:14.238 --> 11:17.111
Please hurry!
- Need more information.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.417
- It needs to cover
my chest and stomach,

11:19.461 --> 11:21.855
boost self-esteem,
and reduce shame.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.073
- Still searching.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.597
- Faster!
I've got a funeral to get to!

11:25.641 --> 11:27.077
Normal man shirt!
But not itchy!

11:27.121 --> 11:29.340
Extra-grip buttons
for sweaty thumbs!

11:29.384 --> 11:31.081
- You've selected "buttons."

11:31.125 --> 11:33.867
There are 1,500 shirts
with buttons.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.217
Here's the top choice
based on your DNA

11:36.260 --> 11:37.609
and psychological profile.

11:37.653 --> 11:40.134
- Polyester cotton blend.
Two arms.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.744
Ohh! A neck hole.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.616
This <i>is</i> promising.
What's my size?

11:44.660 --> 11:46.009
- You've asked, "What's my size?"

11:46.053 --> 11:48.142
Connecting you
to our award-winning

11:48.185 --> 11:51.145
user help portal
and measuring center.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.016
- Please remain still
for measurement

11:53.060 --> 11:56.890
while you enjoy this ad
for Nester's Cheese Nebulizer.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.935
- Take that Nester Cheese
straight to the dome!

11:58.979 --> 12:02.504
Nester's Cheese Nebulizer
comes in new extreme flavors!

12:02.547 --> 12:03.940
Monterey Crack,

12:03.984 --> 12:06.203
Chili Con Gnarly,
and Flamin' Flag!

12:06.247 --> 12:07.814
- Thank you for waiting.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.990
We have selected
the properly sized shirt.

12:10.033 --> 12:13.384
Please take this 30-question
satisfaction survey.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.951
On a scale of one to ten,

12:14.995 --> 12:17.954
how likely are you to purchase
Nester's Cheese Nebulizer?

12:17.998 --> 12:21.262
- Six?
What about my shirt?!

12:21.305 --> 12:22.872
- To purchase,
please confirm you are ready

12:22.916 --> 12:26.049
for the first day of the rest
of your luh-luh-life.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.747
- I do.

12:32.403 --> 12:34.754
It's no use, Shirty.

12:34.797 --> 12:38.061
I'll never satisfy Baba
or replace you!

12:38.105 --> 12:39.889
- I have to go now.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.283
But know that Baba
believes in you!

12:42.326 --> 12:44.154
And so do I.

12:44.198 --> 12:47.070
Find a new shirt, Pete!

12:47.114 --> 12:48.593
- I'm gonna do it!

12:48.637 --> 12:51.031
You'll see! You'll all see!

12:51.074 --> 12:53.381
This one's for my mother!

12:53.424 --> 12:54.817
- Oh, right. This guy.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.776
We got a topless incel
talking about his mom,

12:56.819 --> 12:58.081
Definitely gonna
shoot up the place.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.518
I'm gonna take him out.
Ohp. Wait a minute.

13:00.562 --> 13:03.913
There's a note on his back.
Ugh. False alarm.

13:03.957 --> 13:07.874
- And I guess my favorite kind of
prayer is the bedside prayer,

13:07.917 --> 13:10.224
just 'cause it sums up the day
so nice.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.878
Or the reverse-cowgirl prayer!

13:11.921 --> 13:13.749
That's when a cowgirl begs
for the Lord's forgiveness

13:13.793 --> 13:15.751
for all the saucy pants
she wears.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.361
How 'bout you?
- I don't pray.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.364
But I have a poem I recite
when I lose a sock from a pair.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.932
It's from the lost sock's
point of view,

13:22.976 --> 13:26.283
wishing to be reunited
with its mate.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.244
Kenton?
Aren't you gonna kiss me?

13:30.287 --> 13:33.551
- Huh? We're here to play
Seven Minutes in Heaven, silly,

13:33.595 --> 13:36.685
the game where I talk about
Heaven for seven minutes.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.730
So, my grandma was there,
but this time,

13:38.774 --> 13:40.994
she was super <i>in</i> favor
of gay marriage.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.823
I also played a game of chess
with Martin Luther King Jr.,

13:43.866 --> 13:46.651
who spread the message
that veganism is lit!

13:46.695 --> 13:48.784
- That sounds just like
something MLK would say.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.309
- Please don't interrupt, Annie!
I only have seven minutes!

13:54.485 --> 13:56.270
- Hello.
Is Baba caller nine?

13:56.313 --> 13:57.837
- You'll find out right after you

13:57.880 --> 13:59.882
answer our question of the day.
Mer?

13:59.926 --> 14:02.232
- Tell us about
your last breakup.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.800
You sound like
a very passionate woman.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.324
Well, it was this morning.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.500
Baba finally had to snip-snip!

14:09.544 --> 14:11.676
- Oh, brutal!
Vasectomy of the heart!

14:11.720 --> 14:13.156
Why'd you cut him loose, Baba?

14:13.200 --> 14:15.593
- Bet he was lousy in bed.
Mm-hmm.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.813
- True. He still can't sleep
through night.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.728
But he good boy.
- Dag, girl.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.904
He sounds like a luh-luh-loser!

14:21.948 --> 14:23.514
- Petey not loser!

14:23.558 --> 14:25.734
He just do better
with Baba help.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.954
- Sounds like Baba's
not ready to let him go.

14:27.997 --> 14:31.958
What's your verdict, Succatash?
- Own it!

14:32.001 --> 14:33.263
- Baba...own it?

14:33.307 --> 14:35.875
- Seems like you've still
got feelings for him.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.572
Plus you're caller number 6!

14:37.615 --> 14:40.140
Succatash, Succatash.
That sucka-sucka sucks!

14:41.576 --> 14:45.232
- Yes. Baba <i>own</i> it!

14:45.275 --> 14:47.930
Baba coming, Petey!

14:47.974 --> 14:50.890
- Ooh!
- Hey! What the hell!

14:50.933 --> 14:52.935
- No!
- Ew! He's running and sweating!

14:52.979 --> 14:55.459
- That won't work!
I don't understand.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.113
Why can't I find it?!

14:57.157 --> 14:59.550
No! Not that!

14:59.594 --> 15:01.248
Get out of my way!
- Ow!

15:01.291 --> 15:03.728
- Move!
- Boy. Here we go again.

15:03.772 --> 15:06.906
- I've got a right to bare arms!
- Oh, my gun's in the car.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.996
- Society's not gonna stop
Old Petey boy

15:10.039 --> 15:11.736
from getting his last shot!

15:11.780 --> 15:12.955
- Oh, no, sweetie,
you're gonna get shot again.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.044
- Xenu approves!
- This is so boring.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.742
- Welcome to Only Pants.
I'm Charlie Pants.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.919
No relation
to the Only Pants Pants.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.182
Our same names
are just a coinci-pants.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.924
- Please --
show me your finest shirt!

15:24.967 --> 15:27.143
- Did you catch
the name of the store, pal?

15:27.187 --> 15:28.971
We only sell pants.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.931
- I hoped you were a store for
shoppers who only have pants!

15:31.974 --> 15:34.063
'Cause right now
that's all I've got!

15:34.107 --> 15:35.543
- Sir, I'm going to need you

15:35.586 --> 15:37.153
to lower your voice
and exit the store.

15:37.197 --> 15:40.940
- Every day, I wake up
and sexlessly touch the dead

15:40.983 --> 15:43.464
without issue,
thanks to a very special,

15:43.507 --> 15:46.423
irreplaceable shirt
that's now...gone!

15:46.467 --> 15:48.512
WHY WON'T YOU HELP ME?!

15:48.556 --> 15:51.037
- Hey, Fred! In here!
We got us a code YIKES.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.474
Put down your weapon!

15:53.517 --> 15:55.737
And put your shirt on!
- Huh?

15:55.780 --> 15:59.045
Oh, no! The sign fell off!
- Hands where I can see 'em!

16:03.701 --> 16:05.747
- Uh-agh...

16:05.790 --> 16:08.141
- Ugh! Stop! What are you doing?!

16:08.184 --> 16:11.231
When the bottle lands on you,
you have to close your eyes

16:11.274 --> 16:14.016
and ask God to let you
into Heaven some day.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.019
- Listen. Now, Annie didn't want
me to mention this, but...

16:17.063 --> 16:19.108
I actually died
and came back to life.

16:19.152 --> 16:24.287
Except <i>you don't see me
making a big deal out of it!</i>

16:24.331 --> 16:25.941
Okay?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.725
- <i>You</i> met God?

16:27.769 --> 16:30.728
- I don't know.
I meet a lot of people.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.774
Now, can we make out already?

16:32.817 --> 16:34.558
- Well, uh, if you
really went to Heaven,

16:34.602 --> 16:36.952
how does Steve Jobs
take his coffee, hm?

16:36.996 --> 16:40.260
- There is no Heaven!
Kenton is a liar!

16:41.652 --> 16:43.959
- Moam, I know you're troubled,
but Annie and I

16:44.003 --> 16:45.700
were just getting
to the good part.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.223
- It's not what you think.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.051
- Kenton, you can
drop the savior act.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.792
Annie's willing
to give you handjobs

16:50.835 --> 16:53.099
entirely based on your face.

16:53.142 --> 16:56.885
And if she chickens out, as many
women do, I'm here to help.

16:56.928 --> 16:59.279
- We need to wait till marriage
for up-and-downs!

16:59.322 --> 17:01.281
I think you better go.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.804
- Listen.

17:02.847 --> 17:05.372
I died for <i>real,</i> kid,
and there's no afterlife.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.591
Just admit it. You made it up!

17:07.635 --> 17:10.246
- Annie! I'm not lying. I swear.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.770
- Prove it!
- Wh-- How?

17:12.814 --> 17:14.903
- Well, why don't you and I
have a friendly little

17:14.946 --> 17:17.427
come-back competition?

17:19.734 --> 17:21.692
- Then Mother sent me to find
a new shirt without her!

17:21.736 --> 17:24.173
- Baba coming!
- And get some powdered milk!

17:24.217 --> 17:26.175
Here! I'll show you!
- He's reaching for his weapon!

17:26.219 --> 17:28.699
- Beep-beep! Baba here!
- Everybody reach for yours!

17:34.488 --> 17:37.665
- Please no shoot!
He good boy!

17:37.708 --> 17:39.928
Baba should have been here!

17:39.971 --> 17:44.019
- Stand down. We got
a mama's boy, not a bad boy.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.196
All clear. Just a different <i>
kind</i> of "yikes." Over.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.895
- Sorry about your nickels, Baba.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.246
I wasn't able to find a shirt.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.378
- Is Baba fail, Petey.

17:55.422 --> 17:58.555
Snip-snip was bad plan.
No worry.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.862
I retie apron strings...

18:00.905 --> 18:02.646
....even tighter!

18:06.998 --> 18:08.217
- No!
- Kenton, you can't!

18:08.261 --> 18:09.697
- Don't do it!
- Kenton!

18:09.740 --> 18:12.308
- I need to prove I would
never lie to a friend.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.180
Actually...a girlfriend.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.879
- Somebody seems
to care more about Annie

18:17.922 --> 18:19.228
than he does about God!

18:19.272 --> 18:21.230
- You're just jealous! What?

18:21.274 --> 18:24.015
Everyone knows Kenton
gives you impure thoughts.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.192
- He gives <i>all</i> of us
impure thoughts!

18:26.235 --> 18:27.541
- Come on, Kenton!

18:27.584 --> 18:29.978
If God were real,
he wouldn't have all day.

18:30.021 --> 18:32.981
- You mean "she."
- Oh, now I'm <i>sure</i> you're lying.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.939
Let's get on with it!
- It's true!

18:34.983 --> 18:37.246
God is super busy,
and she doesn't appreciate

18:37.290 --> 18:39.292
when people waste her time,
same as Ben Stiller.

18:39.335 --> 18:43.122
- Kenton, no! Let's go back in
the closet and pray instead!

18:43.165 --> 18:45.559
And maybe, if you feel like
God would be cool with it,

18:45.602 --> 18:47.430
you can guess my bra size.

18:47.474 --> 18:48.779
- Annie, if I don't make it back,

18:48.823 --> 18:50.651
know that in spite
of everything

18:50.694 --> 18:54.611
my friends and Moam said, <i>
I</i> don't think you're boring.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.352
But if I do get to return,

18:56.396 --> 18:58.224
I'll ask God
if we can lay the groundwork

18:58.267 --> 19:01.183
for some light kissing
in three to six months.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.316
- Oh, Kenton.
Please don't do it.

19:03.359 --> 19:07.233
- Time to play Seven Minutes
in Heaven. For real.

19:09.626 --> 19:12.151
- Now Baba protect you
wherever you go.

19:12.194 --> 19:16.329
It too late for you to be
well-adjusted grown man.

19:16.372 --> 19:20.855
Baba learn from wise man name
Succatash to just "own it."

19:22.683 --> 19:24.772
- Mmm. It's perfect!

19:24.815 --> 19:26.643
- Yes. Baba very good mother.

19:26.687 --> 19:30.517
Now go do funeral
for paying customers.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.319
- Hey, Steve!
Have you seen God around?

19:50.363 --> 19:52.234
- She's over there
making it rain

19:52.278 --> 19:55.150
with Luke Perry
and Nipsey Hussle.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.891
- Get them umbrellas ready,
Texas!

19:56.934 --> 19:58.806
Oh, hey, Kenton.
- Hey, little brother.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.721
He missed us and came back.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.331
Welcome home forever, Kenton.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.898
- Actually, God, I hate to ask,

20:03.941 --> 20:06.335
but could you
send me back again?

20:06.379 --> 20:08.859
I'm only here because
my girlfriend's friend

20:08.903 --> 20:10.818
didn't believe me about Heaven.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.428
- I'm sorry.

20:12.472 --> 20:15.257
A few years ago, I had to make
a policy of two lives only.

20:15.301 --> 20:19.218
Somebody -- I won't say who --
ruined it for everyone.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.045
- It was Steve Irwin, wasn't it?
- It was.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.351
I'm sorry, Kenton.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.223
- What?!
But Annie's waiting for me!

20:24.266 --> 20:27.269
- Annie means well, honey, but
she's from a messed-up family.

20:27.313 --> 20:30.751
And Trophy isn't her friend.
That's her mom.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.361
- You mean her <i>moam.</i>

20:32.405 --> 20:35.364
- Baby, you're better off
up here with us.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.061
- Hey. Is Trophy here yet?

20:37.105 --> 20:39.107
At least now she'll know
that Heaven's real.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.282
- Well...

20:48.072 --> 20:50.249
- It's been seven minutes!
- Kenton?

20:50.292 --> 20:52.033
Come back! Come back, Mom!

20:52.076 --> 20:54.035
- Um, it's pronounced "Moam."

20:54.078 --> 20:55.819
- How could you leave me again?!

20:55.863 --> 20:59.388
And take the first and maybe
only boyfriend I'll ever have!

21:02.435 --> 21:04.437
- Yes! I win!

21:04.480 --> 21:07.135
The afterlife
is a dark, boring void.

21:07.178 --> 21:08.919
In your dead face!
- Kenton?

21:08.963 --> 21:11.531
- Move away from the light,
Kenton! Move away!

21:11.574 --> 21:13.359
- Tell God I've never been naked!

21:13.402 --> 21:15.796
- Maybe he died for our sins?

21:15.839 --> 21:18.755
- Forget him.
He was clearly a fraud.

21:18.799 --> 21:19.974
Here's all you need to know.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.106
When you suppress
your sexual urges

21:22.150 --> 21:24.718
in the name of religion,
things get <i>weird.</i>

21:24.761 --> 21:27.416
- Maybe he died so we can
touch...tongues?

21:27.460 --> 21:30.332
- Or rub our ankles
together in hot tubs?

21:30.376 --> 21:32.421
- Kids, it doesn't matter
who or what you do.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.118
There is no God.

21:34.162 --> 21:36.207
- We were gonna lightly kiss
in three to six months,

21:36.251 --> 21:38.993
pending God's approval,
and now he's...

21:39.036 --> 21:40.516
- Gone forever!

21:40.560 --> 21:43.432
But we will get
those pudgy little fingers

21:43.476 --> 21:47.610
around some other teen's peen
before ya know it.

21:55.226 --> 21:57.359
Hey, God?
- Are you happy I paired you up

21:57.403 --> 21:59.230
with Anna Nicole Smith
for eternity?

21:59.274 --> 22:01.450
- I am. Totally. Yeah.
It's just, um --

22:01.494 --> 22:03.583
Can you tell me
how to get my pants off?

22:03.626 --> 22:05.889
The waist won't budge,
and there's no zipper.

22:05.933 --> 22:09.153
And I'm <i>pretty</i> eager to finally
have sex since I died a virgin.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.938
I even turned down
a tuggie huggie

22:10.981 --> 22:13.680
so I could get back to Heaven!
- Oh, honey.

22:13.723 --> 22:16.552
You were supposed to get sex
out of your system on Earth.

22:16.596 --> 22:21.383
Up here, pants never come off,
and no one has genitals.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.342
It's Heaven!
