WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:05.198
Get out of the way!

00:07.640 --> 00:09.039
Oh.

00:09.109 --> 00:10.440
Whoa. Easy, now.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.307
Whoo.

00:15.548 --> 00:17.709
Hey, watch out!

00:17.784 --> 00:18.808
Come on. Come on.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.318
Sorry.

00:21.755 --> 00:22.983
Tommy, me boy...

00:27.560 --> 00:29.084
Did you hurt yourself,
Tommy- Boy?

00:30.530 --> 00:32.464
l think l zigged
when l should have zagged.

00:32.531 --> 00:35.592
Well, maybe you ought to stick
to a horse and carriage.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.964
Still, she's a beauty.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.004
The world must
be treating you well

00:39.139 --> 00:40.504
to afford such a thing.

00:41.574 --> 00:44.065
Just dipping
into my inheritance.

00:44.177 --> 00:46.611
Oh, come into some money,
did you?

00:46.679 --> 00:48.010
So who's passed on?

00:48.081 --> 00:51.107
Um, my grandfather
on my mother's side.

00:51.184 --> 00:53.778
An aristocrat,
God rest his soul.

00:53.853 --> 00:55.946
Sounds like he was a fine man.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.785
l'd drink a toast to him,

00:57.857 --> 00:59.984
if l had a shilling
to me name.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.424
Here. lt's on me.

01:04.497 --> 01:07.989
lt'll take three pints
to do a proper job, Tommy- Boy.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.331
And this isn't
even enough for two.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.166
There. That's all l've got.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.297
You're a generous man.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.635
Care to join me at Sullivan's?

01:15.708 --> 01:16.732
Ah, l wish l could,

01:16.843 --> 01:18.936
but l'm on my way
to Castle O'Dell.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.309
Night's coming.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.746
And they say
when the sun goes down,

01:22.816 --> 01:26.650
the queen of the faerie folk
reclaims the castle.

01:26.719 --> 01:29.119
Ah.

01:29.189 --> 01:30.781
l'll give her your regards.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.848
Don't say l didn't warn ya.

01:36.629 --> 01:40.963
Computer,
replace damaged tire.

01:43.670 --> 01:47.936
Saints preserve us.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:39.452 --> 03:42.114
l thought l would die
from the shock of it.

03:42.188 --> 03:43.416
Now, Seamus,
you're not a great one

03:43.489 --> 03:45.218
for telling things
the way they were.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.451
l'll admit l've been known

03:46.526 --> 03:49.120
to add a little color
to stories from time to time

03:49.195 --> 03:52.653
to liven things up,
but with God as my witness

03:52.732 --> 03:55.166
l saw Tom Paris using
unnatural powers

03:55.268 --> 03:57.532
to fix that wheel of his.

03:57.637 --> 04:01.095
Tommy- Boy practicing
unholy magic?

04:01.207 --> 04:03.505
Next thing
you'll be telling me is

04:03.576 --> 04:05.544
you want to pay
for your own drinks.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.279
Make fun if you like,
but he was heading

04:09.349 --> 04:12.978
up to Castle O'Dell
only an hour before dark.

04:13.052 --> 04:14.883
Oh, leave it alone, Seamus.

04:14.954 --> 04:15.886
Can't one day go by

04:15.955 --> 04:17.478
without you making
an ass of yourself?

04:17.557 --> 04:18.319
Mm.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.291
But that Tom Paris
is an odd one.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.726
Coming and going through town
as if he built the place.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.286
That's right,
and where does he go?

04:25.365 --> 04:28.232
Oh, he's a shifty one,
and for that matter,

04:28.334 --> 04:29.392
so are his friends.

04:29.502 --> 04:30.901
lf you're talking
about Katie O'Clare,

04:30.970 --> 04:32.028
you better watch your mouth.

04:32.138 --> 04:34.732
Oh. Well, you know what
they say, Sullivan- -

04:34.841 --> 04:36.172
birds of a feather...

04:36.242 --> 04:40.872
They also say superstition
is the religion of fools.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.405
Kilmanin, 1846.

04:44.484 --> 04:45.542
What?

04:45.618 --> 04:47.677
Old Patsy down in County Meath

04:47.754 --> 04:52.691
spoke of a band of spirit folk
who came to Kilmanin in '46.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.158
Kilmanin?

04:54.227 --> 04:56.218
Did you ever hear of it, Doc?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.957
No, this is the first.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.725
Ah, but you won't
find it on any map.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.064
Not anymore.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.101
lt was a town

05:04.170 --> 05:07.230
not much different
than Fair Haven.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.537
That is, until this group
of strangers arrived.

05:10.610 --> 05:14.171
The townsfolk welcomed them
with open arms.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.874
After all, a stranger

05:15.982 --> 05:18.883
is just a friend
you haven't met yet.

05:18.951 --> 05:22.079
But they regretted
their hospitality soon enough.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.316
The cows stopped giving milk.

05:24.390 --> 05:27.018
The potatoes grew
rotten in the ground.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.890
Then people started
to go missing.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.189
Oh, go on.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.287
lt's true.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.229
What happened to them?

05:33.299 --> 05:34.493
They were taken...

05:34.567 --> 05:36.762
to the otherworld.

05:36.869 --> 05:38.837
When winter came

05:38.905 --> 05:44.502
and the nights grew longer,
the entire town vanished

05:44.577 --> 05:46.408
every post, every nail- -

05:46.479 --> 05:51.917
poof- - into thin air,
never to be seen again.

05:51.984 --> 05:53.349
Are you suggesting

05:53.419 --> 05:56.320
that Fair Haven's going
to go the way of Kilmanin

05:56.389 --> 05:58.289
just because we have
a few new folks in town?

05:58.358 --> 06:02.192
l'm suggesting you keep an eye
on Tom Paris and his cohorts.

06:02.261 --> 06:05.230
Not to mention
that lady friend of yours.

06:05.298 --> 06:08.062
So Katie's some kind of
goblin now, is that it?

06:08.167 --> 06:11.295
She's certainly cast
a spell on you.

06:11.404 --> 06:12.632
Well, if you ask me...

06:13.973 --> 06:15.304
Katie!

06:15.375 --> 06:16.307
Am l interrupting?

06:16.376 --> 06:17.502
Aw, just some nonsense.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.374
Seamus is up
to his old tricks again.

06:19.445 --> 06:20.571
Good day to you, Katie.

06:20.646 --> 06:21.772
Oh, it's good to see you.

06:21.848 --> 06:22.780
What'll it be?

06:22.849 --> 06:24.976
The usual, please.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.712
Well, one cup of tea
coming right up.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.277
Did you snatch any children
on the way into town, Katie?

06:29.355 --> 06:30.788
What?

06:30.857 --> 06:33.325
Never mind.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.451
l missed your smile.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.495
What have you been
doing with yourself?

06:36.562 --> 06:37.893
Nothing terribly exciting.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.556
Just helping my aunt
and uncle out on the farm.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.499
They're not as spry
as they used to be.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.069
Although, they've got
a goat that could argue

06:44.137 --> 06:46.662
Mossie Donegan's talking pig
under the table.

06:46.773 --> 06:47.899
You'll have to bring
him into the bar

06:48.040 --> 06:49.007
the next time you're up.

06:49.108 --> 06:50.598
We'll arrange a debate.

06:50.710 --> 06:51.870
l'll see that l do.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.412
l hear they opened
a nickelodeon in Dooleen.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.176
l thought it might
be nice to go to a show.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.239
l've got to tend the bar.

06:58.317 --> 06:59.716
l wish you'd let me
know you were coming.

06:59.786 --> 07:00.753
l would've made arrangements.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.377
That's all right.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.514
We can go some other time.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.920
No, l mean, you've
already made the trip.

07:04.991 --> 07:07.050
lt'd be a shame
if you have to leave.

07:07.126 --> 07:09.185
Well, l could be
convinced to stay

07:09.262 --> 07:12.288
if you'd be up
for a game of... rings.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.458
Let's go.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.139
Computer, one dozen
Broadway lilies.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.639
Something tells me
that's not lunch.

07:31.717 --> 07:32.649
Already ate.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.117
Ah. Who are they for?

07:34.187 --> 07:35.449
A friend.

07:35.521 --> 07:38.513
Oh, and this friend
wouldn't happen to be

07:38.591 --> 07:40.889
a lovely lrish lass,
now, would she?

07:41.027 --> 07:42.756
Aren't you due on the Bridge?

07:42.829 --> 07:44.228
Ah, you better watch
yourself, Harry.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.889
These country girls aren't
as simple as you think.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.489
Maggie O'Halloran
could be a little more

07:48.601 --> 07:50.569
than you can handle.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.433
l heard about your
little traffic accident.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.532
That was a clutch malfunction.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.608
lt wasn't my fault.

07:56.709 --> 07:58.176
lf you ask me,
that whole program

07:58.277 --> 08:00.245
is an accident
waiting to happen.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.804
You have been running
Fair Haven around the clock.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.348
Just yesterday,
l had to replace

08:04.417 --> 08:05.748
three holo- emitters.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.150
l ran a full diagnostic
this morning.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.188
Everything is fine.

08:09.255 --> 08:12.418
Whatever you say.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.517
But when your quaint,
little seaside town

08:14.594 --> 08:16.687
starts to depolarize,
don't come running to me.

08:18.364 --> 08:21.993
lf you'll excuse me,
l'm late for a moonlight stroll.

08:22.101 --> 08:23.432
Are you sure you
don't need a chaperon?

08:24.770 --> 08:26.237
Not with your driving record.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.872
l think l know just
what'll make his date

08:30.977 --> 08:33.969
just a little more interesting.

08:34.046 --> 08:38.380
Just don't blow out
any more holo- emitters.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.439
What are we doing out here,
Seamus,

09:01.474 --> 09:03.704
skulking about in the
dark, spying on folks?

09:03.776 --> 09:05.038
What's the matter, Milo?

09:05.111 --> 09:06.703
You got a case of the willies?

09:06.779 --> 09:08.212
Well, what if you're right?

09:08.281 --> 09:10.749
What if this Tom Paris
is some kind of demon?

09:10.816 --> 09:12.807
lf we're caught, he'll
cast a spell on us.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.046
Then stop your squawking
or he'll catch us for sure.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.213
Come on, man.
He's getting away.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.483
Ah.

09:19.525 --> 09:22.551
A captain is only as good
as his crew.

09:22.628 --> 09:23.925
lt must be lonely
out there on the sea

09:23.996 --> 09:26.829
with only the stars
to guide you.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.332
Sometimes,
during the night watch,

09:29.435 --> 09:31.869
with the timbers creaking,
and the dark water

09:31.971 --> 09:33.996
stretching out as far
as the eye can see,

09:34.106 --> 09:37.041
you can believe you're
the only man in the world.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.406
Maybe you should think

09:38.477 --> 09:40.342
about settling
down on dry land.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.675
Well, believe me, l do.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.408
As often as l think of you.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.882
Can l ask you something, Harry?

09:46.018 --> 09:46.780
Of course.

09:46.852 --> 09:50.151
Would you like to hold my hand?

09:50.222 --> 09:51.655
lf you promise
to hold mine back.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.866
Look. He's got some sort
of contraption in his hand.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.424
Ooh, maybe we're going
about this the wrong way.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.663
We should go down to St. Mary's

10:05.771 --> 10:07.636
and tell Father Mulligan
the whole story.

10:07.707 --> 10:09.937
He's not going to listen
to talk of the supernatural.

10:10.042 --> 10:11.509
Aw, if you fill
his collection box,

10:11.577 --> 10:12.942
he'll listen to anything.

10:13.045 --> 10:14.376
That's true.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.608
l thought you were promised
to Ray Ewan.

10:16.682 --> 10:17.614
Not anymore.

10:17.683 --> 10:18.741
Ah.

10:18.818 --> 10:20.115
Can l ask you
something else, Harry?

10:20.186 --> 10:21.153
Please.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.381
Would you like to kiss me?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.117
ls that a trick question?

10:29.929 --> 10:32.227
Holy Mother of God!

10:34.433 --> 10:36.424
Tom!

10:39.905 --> 10:41.566
Don't you have
anything better to do?

10:41.674 --> 10:45.132
Oh, boy.
She really turned on you.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.336
Ha- ha, very funny.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.937
l could have been trampled.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.448
Relax. The holodeck
safeties are on.

10:50.516 --> 10:51.847
There's nothing to worry about.

10:51.917 --> 10:52.849
Poor Maggie.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.351
All right, all right.
You've had your fun.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.352
Now change her back.

10:55.421 --> 10:56.649
Chakotay to Paris and Kim.

10:56.722 --> 10:57.916
Report to the Bridge.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.252
On our way.

11:00.860 --> 11:01.849
What about Maggie?

11:01.927 --> 11:04.088
She'll be fine.
Let her graze.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.427
- Did you hear that?
- Ah!

11:11.704 --> 11:12.636
Amen.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.036
Please be seated.

11:21.647 --> 11:24.810
l recently heard a tale
of two farmers,

11:24.884 --> 11:28.320
who shall remain nameless
for the sake of this sermon.

11:28.387 --> 11:30.446
lt seems one broke
the other's plow

11:30.523 --> 11:31.785
and refused to replace it.

11:31.857 --> 11:35.190
His comeuppance was served
to him not by the hand of God

11:35.261 --> 11:38.526
but by the other farmer,
in the form

11:38.597 --> 11:40.963
of a clogged irrigation ditch.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.694
Now, do you think
their disagreement

11:43.803 --> 11:45.566
stopped there?

11:45.671 --> 11:47.002
Of course not.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.871
They go on...

11:49.942 --> 11:52.706
just as the heathen did of old.

11:52.778 --> 11:53.904
After all, one spiteful act

11:53.979 --> 11:55.640
deserves another, right?

11:56.716 --> 11:57.740
Wrong!

11:57.817 --> 12:01.014
What these sinners
have forgotten

12:01.087 --> 12:03.351
is that they are neighbors.

12:03.422 --> 12:05.720
He's in love with the sound
of his own voice.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.622
Whether we are man or woman,

12:07.693 --> 12:09.024
parent or child...

12:09.095 --> 12:11.461
flesh and blood
or photons and force fields...

12:12.631 --> 12:14.599
lt has been said...

12:14.667 --> 12:15.759
On the other hand,

12:15.868 --> 12:18.996
perhaps he's been nipping
at the sacramental wine.

12:19.105 --> 12:22.541
And, as such,
our community is everything.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.873
lt is our world,
and we are a part of it

12:25.945 --> 12:29.813
just as a branch
is part of a tree.

12:29.882 --> 12:35.149
Do you see... branches
tearing leaves off one another?

12:35.221 --> 12:36.313
No!

12:36.388 --> 12:37.412
Do you see

12:37.490 --> 12:40.050
roots hoarding water
from the trunk?

12:40.126 --> 12:41.218
No!

12:41.293 --> 12:42.282
Do you see...?

12:43.395 --> 12:44.327
Easy, Maggie.

12:44.396 --> 12:45.420
Whoa.

12:48.367 --> 12:49.459
Oh. Easy now.

12:50.569 --> 12:52.161
Did you make a wrong turn

12:52.271 --> 12:54.398
on your way to the milking shed?

12:54.507 --> 12:56.941
Oh, nothing like that
at all, Father.

12:57.009 --> 12:58.772
Something terrible's happened.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.778
What now?

13:00.846 --> 13:02.438
This was Maggie O'Halloran.

13:02.515 --> 13:06.007
The spirits
have turned her into a cow.

13:06.085 --> 13:09.452
Maggie O'Halloran's
been eaten by a cow?

13:09.522 --> 13:11.319
Did you see these spirits?

13:11.390 --> 13:12.755
That we did- -

13:12.825 --> 13:15.316
Tom Paris and Harry Kim.

13:17.062 --> 13:19.496
l hate to disappoint you,
but it sounds as though

13:19.565 --> 13:21.999
you've been the victim
of a practical joke.

13:22.101 --> 13:23.864
Tom Paris is a known prankster.

13:23.969 --> 13:24.936
Oh...

13:25.004 --> 13:26.596
it was unholy magic, l tell you.

13:26.705 --> 13:27.672
Aye, aye.

13:27.740 --> 13:28.866
We saw it with our own eyes.

13:28.974 --> 13:33.673
When did this alleged
transformation take place?

13:33.746 --> 13:34.678
Last night.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.237
Well, then, that settles it.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.510
This couldn't possibly be
Maggie O'Halloran.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.950
l saw Maggie this morning
on my way into church.

13:41.053 --> 13:43.044
She was at her cart
tending her flowers.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.384
She's probably there now.

13:45.624 --> 13:46.591
Well, l... l think

13:46.659 --> 13:48.718
that's enough excitement
for one morning.

13:48.794 --> 13:49.726
This mass is over.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.729
Go in peace.

13:51.797 --> 13:53.264
Um... leave the cow.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.822
Oh...

13:54.900 --> 13:56.333
All right, Father.

13:56.435 --> 13:57.868
Excuse us, Maggie.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.268
Take care, Maggie.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.368
Whoa.

14:09.114 --> 14:10.706
Maggie...

14:10.783 --> 14:12.410
Well, good morning, boys.

14:12.484 --> 14:13.781
ls everything all right?

14:13.853 --> 14:16.754
Y- you're looking a little
out of sorts this morning.

14:16.822 --> 14:20.417
Yes. Well, l must admit
l'm not quite myself today.

14:20.492 --> 14:21.584
Oh?

14:21.660 --> 14:23.628
Well, this is going
to sound very odd,

14:23.696 --> 14:26.722
but l feel like l just woke up
from the strangest dream,

14:26.799 --> 14:28.733
and l don't remember going
to sleep.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.598
You're right,
that does sound odd.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.639
Do you remember anything
about last night?

14:34.740 --> 14:36.332
Well, l was out with Harry Kim.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.307
He chatted me up
at The Ox and Lamb,

14:38.377 --> 14:40.743
and we were off on a
walk before l knew it.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.337
What did you do on your walk?

14:42.414 --> 14:43.346
We talked.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.940
What kind of a girl
do you think l am?

14:46.018 --> 14:48.953
Now, Maggie,
we weren't implying anything.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.612
- No!
- Do you recall

14:50.689 --> 14:53.522
anything else
about the evening?

14:53.592 --> 14:57.289
Ah, did anything out of the, um,
ordinary happen?

14:57.363 --> 14:58.489
Anything at all?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.429
l don't remember.

15:00.499 --> 15:03.662
Well, tell us
about the dream, then.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.327
Oh, it was most unpleasant.

15:05.437 --> 15:06.870
l was walking around town

15:07.006 --> 15:09.440
with nothing
but a bell around my neck.

15:09.508 --> 15:11.738
Well, somehow,
l wound up in church.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.244
Everyone was staring at me.

15:14.313 --> 15:15.575
You were there, Seamus...

15:15.648 --> 15:17.081
And you, too, Milo.

15:18.150 --> 15:21.551
The next thing l knew,
l was tending my flowers

15:21.620 --> 15:23.554
just as you boys walked up.

15:23.622 --> 15:26.682
Well, that's quite a story,
Maggie.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.693
Can we get a quick one?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.388
Maybe just a wee taste.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.333
So, l said to young Harry,

15:36.435 --> 15:38.903
''l'm not one for rainy days
and gray skies.''

15:39.071 --> 15:41.471
As soon as the words were
out of my mouth,

15:41.540 --> 15:44.008
he called up the spirits
to do his bidding.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.942
A second later,
there wasn't a cloud in the sky.

15:47.012 --> 15:49.503
l was up near Ballahick farm
with little Mary.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.173
She was playing near the well.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.548
Somehow, she lost her footing
and fell in.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.143
l was so frightened.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.414
l didn't know what to do.

15:56.488 --> 15:58.718
So, l ran to the Colbys'
to get some help...

15:58.791 --> 16:02.522
but... when we returned,
there was Mary in the meadow,

16:02.594 --> 16:04.585
talking with Katie O'Clare.

16:04.663 --> 16:06.927
There wasn't a scratch on her.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.830
Katie said
l must've been mistaken

16:08.968 --> 16:10.765
when l saw her fall.

16:10.869 --> 16:12.837
There was no mistake.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.133
l saw something strange, too.

16:15.207 --> 16:17.573
Well, l hesitated
to say anything

16:17.643 --> 16:19.543
for fear you'd think me mad.

16:19.611 --> 16:22.603
But after listening
to your stories today,

16:22.681 --> 16:24.876
l feel you've a right to know.

16:24.950 --> 16:25.882
Well?

16:25.951 --> 16:27.350
Speak up.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.877
Last Sunday, after his sermon,

16:30.956 --> 16:36.189
l saw Father Mulligan
vanish into thin air.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.024
He's one of them, right enough.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.828
Father Mulligan, Tommy- Boy,
Katie and the rest- -

16:41.900 --> 16:43.026
they're spirit folk.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.659
Well, what about
that Neelix fellow

16:44.770 --> 16:45.828
who runs The Ox and Lamb?

16:45.938 --> 16:47.872
Well, if he doesn't
look like a leprechaun,

16:47.940 --> 16:48.907
l don't know who does.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.270
They're all probably

16:50.342 --> 16:52.276
up at Castle O'Dell,
conspiring against us.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.606
Now...

16:53.679 --> 16:55.044
that's enough.

16:55.114 --> 16:58.083
l can't deny there's been
some unusual goings- on.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.117
But what are you proposing- -

16:59.184 --> 17:00.708
that we run Katie
and her friends out of town?

17:00.819 --> 17:02.946
Or maybe we should line them up
in front of a firing squad- -

17:02.988 --> 17:04.319
is that what you want?

17:04.390 --> 17:06.915
These people have been
our neighbors.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.425
We've become friends.

17:08.493 --> 17:09.825
Let's not forget that.

17:09.895 --> 17:12.762
Well, we can't
just sit here and do nothing

17:12.830 --> 17:14.924
while they take over Fair Haven.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.002
l'm not saying we do nothing...

17:17.069 --> 17:20.868
but let's go about this
like civilized people.

17:20.939 --> 17:22.531
What do you suggest- -

17:22.641 --> 17:25.906
we sit them down
and discuss it over tea?

17:42.795 --> 17:45.229
You're looking lovelier
than ever, Katie.

17:45.297 --> 17:46.264
Thank you.

17:50.669 --> 17:51.931
Open it.

17:57.276 --> 18:00.143
''The Faerie Queene
by Edmund Spenser.''

18:00.212 --> 18:01.304
Thank you, Michael.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.678
lt's the longest poem
in the English language,

18:03.749 --> 18:05.808
and the first
to use a nine- line stanza.

18:05.884 --> 18:08.079
l'll start reading it tonight.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.586
l love epic poetry.

18:09.655 --> 18:10.587
Really?

18:10.656 --> 18:12.817
l didn't know that.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.490
lt seems as if there's
a lot of things

18:16.562 --> 18:17.995
l don't know about you.

18:19.064 --> 18:20.588
l thought you'd want to know

18:20.666 --> 18:22.827
there's been some talk
about you and your friends.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.462
Strange things have been
happening around town.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.802
Folk are saying you're to blame.

18:28.874 --> 18:31.399
What kind of strange things?

18:31.510 --> 18:34.001
People using unholy magic...

18:34.079 --> 18:36.411
vanishing into thin air...

18:36.482 --> 18:38.382
changing the weather.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.382
By any chance,

18:39.451 --> 18:41.783
would all of this
have anything to do

18:41.854 --> 18:43.879
with your reading suggestion?

18:44.022 --> 18:45.353
As a matter of fact.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.755
Don't tell me.

18:46.825 --> 18:49.794
They say
l'm the ''Faerie Queene.''

18:49.862 --> 18:52.660
Frankly, they could tell me
you're the devil himself,

18:52.731 --> 18:53.789
and l wouldn't care.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.664
l'll try
not to take that personally.

18:56.768 --> 18:59.737
The sad truth of the matter
is...

18:59.805 --> 19:02.171
l don't know who you are.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.504
What do you mean?

19:04.543 --> 19:07.341
You've been lying to me, Katie.

19:07.412 --> 19:10.279
l've been doing some checking
with friends of mine

19:10.349 --> 19:11.373
in County Clare.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.680
Seems nobody's heard
of you there.

19:13.752 --> 19:15.549
lt's a big county.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.521
And l've got a lot of friends.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.826
You've been evasive
from the day we met.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.689
l was a fool not to see it.

19:23.762 --> 19:27.220
Where do you go
when you leave here?

19:27.299 --> 19:30.393
There've been times l wanted
to talk to you- -

19:30.502 --> 19:31.867
tell you about my day,

19:32.004 --> 19:33.665
about a book l'd read...

19:33.772 --> 19:36.297
just to say hello...

19:36.408 --> 19:37.966
but l can't,

19:38.076 --> 19:40.544
because l don't know
where to find you.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.605
What are you hiding, Katie?

19:46.318 --> 19:49.515
l'll admit l have misled you
about some things,

19:49.588 --> 19:51.886
but never
about anything important.

19:51.990 --> 19:55.357
And l wasn't lying
when l said l care about you.

19:55.427 --> 19:57.895
l wish l could believe that.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.292
You can.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.128
l didn't want to deceive you...

20:02.234 --> 20:06.193
but under the circumstances,
l had no choice.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.273
What circumstances?

20:08.373 --> 20:09.635
Michael...

20:09.708 --> 20:11.938
there are things about me

20:12.044 --> 20:15.104
you may not be able
to understand.

20:15.180 --> 20:16.647
Try me.

20:19.184 --> 20:21.618
Who are you, Katie?

20:21.687 --> 20:24.622
Where are you really from?

20:24.690 --> 20:26.317
The truth.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.760
Computer, end program.

20:46.345 --> 20:47.312
How did he know?

20:47.379 --> 20:48.471
Those are questions

20:48.547 --> 20:50.310
no holodeck character
should be asking.

20:50.382 --> 20:51.815
What exactly did you
do to that program?

20:51.883 --> 20:54.613
Well, l, l just added
a few bells and whistles

20:54.686 --> 20:56.119
to make the characters
more realistic.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.120
Nothing too fancy.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.247
Well, something's gone wrong.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.449
The people of Fair Haven

20:59.524 --> 21:02.357
aren't simple country
folk anymore. Report.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.190
lt looks like we've
worn out our welcome.

21:04.229 --> 21:05.992
lt's the first time
we've tried running

21:06.064 --> 21:07.224
a holodeck program nonstop.

21:07.299 --> 21:08.766
We're lucky it lasted this long.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.826
There are damaged subroutines
in all of the character files.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.736
So much for my open door policy.

21:14.806 --> 21:17.639
Shut it down and repair
the damaged systems.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.780
As l recall, everything was fine

21:22.848 --> 21:25.783
until someone started
turning people into cows.

21:27.185 --> 21:31.053
Computer, display Fair Haven
character Michael Sullivan.

21:32.324 --> 21:33.586
Tom.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.924
Where am l?

21:36.995 --> 21:38.587
Where's Katie?

21:38.664 --> 21:40.723
He shouldn't be aware
that he's in the lab.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.630
l've isolated
the damaged subroutines.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.065
l said where the hell am l?!

21:44.169 --> 21:45.636
l- it's all right, Michael.

21:45.704 --> 21:46.636
Take it easy.

21:46.705 --> 21:47.672
What is this place?

21:47.739 --> 21:48.706
Try to relax.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.570
lf someone doesn't tell me
where l am,

21:50.642 --> 21:52.234
l'm going to start
busting heads.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.778
His perceptual filters
are malfunctioning.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.813
What are you saying?
What's a perceptual filter?

21:55.881 --> 21:58.873
l- it's o... it's okay.
We're trying to help you.

21:58.950 --> 22:00.144
There.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.276
Look at these.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.878
Those are the algorithms

22:02.954 --> 22:04.888
designed to keep
him oblivious

22:05.023 --> 22:06.854
to anything outside
the program's parameters.

22:06.925 --> 22:07.892
They're off- line.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.654
Give me a minute.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.194
That should do it.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.697
How are you feeling, Michael?

22:16.168 --> 22:18.636
Never better.

22:18.737 --> 22:21.069
Harry, Liam's been looking
for you.

22:21.139 --> 22:22.606
You're the only man
in four counties

22:22.674 --> 22:23.868
to beat him at arm wrestling.

22:23.942 --> 22:25.375
He wants a rematch.

22:25.444 --> 22:26.741
Tell him he's got one.

22:26.812 --> 22:28.006
l'll do that.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.940
That was easy enough.

22:31.049 --> 22:31.947
Yeah. Unfortunately,

22:32.084 --> 22:33.915
it looks like
all the other characters

22:33.985 --> 22:35.282
have the same malfunction.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.379
Don't tell me we're going

22:37.456 --> 22:39.151
to have to go through
every one of them?

22:39.224 --> 22:41.658
lf we reactivate the program,
use the primary control port

22:41.727 --> 22:43.661
in Sullivan's pub,

22:43.729 --> 22:45.959
we could reset all
the perceptual filters

22:46.031 --> 22:47.464
with a single command sequence.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.159
Ah. l guess we'll be
seeing you later.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.929
Looking forward to it.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.505
Computer, resume Fair Haven
program in Holodeck 1,

22:54.606 --> 22:57.097
and transfer Michael Sullivan
back to his bar.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.686
Danny!

23:12.758 --> 23:13.986
Danny, come here.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.617
Fetch Doc Fitzgerald.

23:15.694 --> 23:18.185
Tell him to meet me
in the church.

23:18.263 --> 23:19.628
Go on, hurry, lad.

23:23.668 --> 23:25.898
We thought we'd reset
his perceptual filters,

23:26.071 --> 23:28.539
until we took a closer look
at his subroutines.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.540
Turns out he was just
playing along.

23:30.609 --> 23:32.577
Ha. Never underestimate
an lrish hologram.

23:32.644 --> 23:35.477
We'll have to reprogram Michael
when we do the others.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.947
Let's just hope he
didn't share the experience

23:38.083 --> 23:39.209
with too many others.

23:39.284 --> 23:41.275
Got it.

23:41.353 --> 23:43.617
These resequenced algorithms
should do the trick.

23:43.688 --> 23:44.985
Good luck.

23:47.192 --> 23:50.457
What the hell was l thinking?

23:50.529 --> 23:52.326
A minor malfunction.

23:52.397 --> 23:54.388
Well, that's the problem.

23:54.466 --> 23:56.798
l've got a boyfriend
who malfunctions.

23:56.902 --> 23:58.563
Tom and Harry'll fix him.

23:58.670 --> 23:59.864
And if they can't?

23:59.971 --> 24:03.168
One piece of advice
you've always given me- -

24:03.275 --> 24:04.333
tell the truth.

24:04.409 --> 24:07.071
Hate to break the news
to you, Michael,

24:07.145 --> 24:09.010
but l'm a starship Captain,

24:09.080 --> 24:12.140
and you're a 300 deciwatt
holodeck program.

24:12.217 --> 24:13.445
l couldn't do it.

24:13.518 --> 24:17.352
ln that case...
you'll have to get creative.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.658
l'm not a
superstitious man, Doc,

24:21.726 --> 24:24.456
but l've been seeing things
l can't explain.

24:24.529 --> 24:26.190
You're not the only one.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.324
At first l thought we had
an epidemic on our hands.

24:29.434 --> 24:30.662
But this is no fever.

24:30.769 --> 24:31.895
No, it's not.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.401
Last night,
l was talking to Katie,

24:33.472 --> 24:34.439
and the next thing l knew,

24:34.506 --> 24:36.303
l was being spirited away
to God knows where.

24:36.374 --> 24:38.069
They took you? Where?

24:38.143 --> 24:40.668
Maybe it was the otherworld.
l don't know.

24:40.745 --> 24:41.939
Tom Paris was there.

24:42.013 --> 24:42.945
Young Harry, too.

24:43.081 --> 24:44.207
What did they want with you?

24:44.282 --> 24:45.249
l'm not sure.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.218
They were talking about me
like l wasn't there.

24:48.286 --> 24:50.220
Saying things about Fair Haven- -

24:50.288 --> 24:52.279
that we knew too much
about them.

24:52.357 --> 24:53.289
Oh, Lord.

24:53.358 --> 24:54.382
And that's not all.

24:54.459 --> 24:55.949
They were saying something

24:56.094 --> 24:57.959
about coming to the pub tonight

24:58.096 --> 24:59.757
to change the town somehow.

24:59.831 --> 25:00.991
What does that mean?

25:01.099 --> 25:02.828
l'm damned if l know.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.961
How did you get away?

25:05.070 --> 25:07.038
With all the talk
about us knowing

25:07.138 --> 25:08.400
too much about them,

25:08.473 --> 25:12.034
l figured that if l pretended
nothing was out of the ordinary,

25:12.110 --> 25:13.338
they might let me go.

25:13.411 --> 25:16.039
And sure enough, that's
exactly what they did.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.879
l wonder if this is how
things started in Kilmanin

25:20.986 --> 25:22.544
back in '46.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.885
l'm not sure
what they have in mind.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.854
But we'd better be prepared.

25:41.139 --> 25:42.538
We're in luck.

25:42.607 --> 25:44.074
Nobody's home.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.826
lf we're going to fight them,
we've got to use

26:05.964 --> 26:07.090
the right ammunition.

26:07.165 --> 26:09.360
Biddy Ramsey gave me this
before she passed on.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.731
She knew a thing or two

26:11.836 --> 26:13.667
about fairy magic
and how to fight it.

26:13.738 --> 26:14.762
Everything she learned,

26:14.873 --> 26:16.602
she learned from this book.

26:16.675 --> 26:19.269
l doubt if it says anything
about using rifles.

26:19.344 --> 26:20.811
You'd be surprised
how many things

26:20.879 --> 26:21.811
a bullet will stop.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.371
l don't like this one bit.

26:24.449 --> 26:25.677
Guns, Seamus.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.742
Under normal circumstances,
l'd agree with you, Michael...

26:28.820 --> 26:30.788
but these aren't
normal circumstances.

26:30.855 --> 26:33.119
Maybe you'd still like us
to be acting civilized.

26:33.191 --> 26:34.556
Where did that get you before?

26:34.626 --> 26:36.491
A ticket to the otherworld,
that's what.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.222
Now, we don't know
what the spirit folk

26:38.296 --> 26:39.228
have in store for us.

26:39.297 --> 26:40.355
That's just it.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.627
We don't know much
about anything, do we?

26:42.701 --> 26:43.690
And we've got Milo here

26:43.802 --> 26:45.895
acting like a holy war
has been declared.

26:46.071 --> 26:47.163
Relax, Sullivan.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.740
The rifles are only
a last resort.

26:49.808 --> 26:53.574
Besides,
we've got incantations,

26:53.645 --> 26:54.703
which are more lethal

26:54.779 --> 26:56.644
to spirit folk than any
weapons forged by man.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.410
That's how we're going

26:58.483 --> 27:00.508
to force them
back into their realm.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.052
And we've got red twine

27:02.087 --> 27:04.453
to stop them
from changing shape.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.353
And don't forget
about the ash berries.

27:06.424 --> 27:07.482
Ash berries, right.

27:07.559 --> 27:10.995
That's how you keep them
from using their powers

27:11.062 --> 27:12.723
against you.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.322
They've been walking
amongst us for weeks now,

27:15.400 --> 27:17.027
pretending to be our friends.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.127
Lying to us, making mischief.

27:20.238 --> 27:21.603
What's next?

27:21.673 --> 27:23.072
Yeah!

27:23.141 --> 27:24.665
What is next, Seamus?

27:24.776 --> 27:26.573
l for one am not going
to stand by

27:26.645 --> 27:28.909
and let them run roughshod
over our town.

27:30.815 --> 27:34.751
We can't rest until we've driven
every one of them out.

27:36.888 --> 27:38.185
They're here!

27:38.256 --> 27:42.022
Tom Paris and Harry Kim- - 
they're in Sullivan's right now!

27:42.093 --> 27:43.890
Who's with me?

27:43.962 --> 27:45.259
Come on.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.497
There they are!

27:59.611 --> 28:01.135
Seamus, let us explain.

28:01.246 --> 28:02.838
You're making a mistake.

28:02.881 --> 28:06.977
The only mistake we made
was letting you into Fair Haven.

28:07.052 --> 28:08.019
What's that?

28:08.086 --> 28:09.075
Shoot it.

28:09.154 --> 28:11.213
No, wait, wait. That's
a delicate piece of...

28:11.289 --> 28:12.756
..technology.

28:12.824 --> 28:16.453
Warning. Holodeck controls and
safety protocols are off- line.

28:16.528 --> 28:17.495
A voice from the otherworld.

28:17.562 --> 28:20.030
Emergency overrides
are malfunctioning.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.127
Computer, freeze program!

28:25.236 --> 28:26.931
62 percent compliance.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.869
They're getting away!

28:28.973 --> 28:29.940
After them!

28:36.948 --> 28:38.643
Computer, exit.

28:59.604 --> 29:00.866
Gunfire?

29:00.972 --> 29:02.803
Two shots directly
at the primary controls.

29:02.841 --> 29:04.138
We can't deactivate the program

29:04.209 --> 29:05.608
or get the safeties
back on line.

29:05.677 --> 29:06.803
Where are Tom and Harry now?

29:06.945 --> 29:08.412
St. Mary's.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.107
Looks like some
of your parishioners

29:10.181 --> 29:11.341
are holding them captive.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.816
We can't blame them
for being frightened.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.648
They must think we're
some kind of sorcerers.

29:16.721 --> 29:18.279
Well, we could use
a little magic right now,

29:18.356 --> 29:19.516
because that's about
the only way

29:19.591 --> 29:20.819
we're going to get
our people back.

29:20.892 --> 29:21.824
Transporters?

29:21.893 --> 29:22.825
Too many stray photons.

29:22.894 --> 29:23.826
We can't get a lock.

29:23.895 --> 29:25.260
We should enter the holodeck

29:25.330 --> 29:27.594
with a security team
and take them by force.

29:27.665 --> 29:28.597
Need l remind you

29:28.666 --> 29:30.793
that the holo- characters
have weapons as well.

29:30.902 --> 29:32.301
We'd be risking armed conflict.

29:32.370 --> 29:33.997
Well, then let's
just pull the plug.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.629
Cut power to the holo- grid.

29:35.740 --> 29:38.504
That would purge the
program from our database.

29:38.576 --> 29:39.770
Exactly.

29:39.844 --> 29:41.436
But we'd lose Fair Haven

29:41.513 --> 29:42.844
and all its people.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.677
They're not people.
They're holograms.

29:44.749 --> 29:46.842
And they weren't programmed
to be violent.

29:46.918 --> 29:48.715
l don't believe
they'd harm anyone.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.152
You can't be certain.

29:50.221 --> 29:51.279
Well, l am certain.

29:51.356 --> 29:53.984
And l'd like to find
a less drastic solution.

29:54.058 --> 29:55.889
With all due respect, Captain,

29:56.027 --> 29:57.858
Michael can be reprogrammed- -

29:57.929 --> 29:59.226
Tom and Harry can't.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.026
One problem at a time,
B'Elanna.

30:01.099 --> 30:03.294
The people of Fair Haven
may not be real,

30:03.401 --> 30:05.164
but our feelings
toward them are.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.204
l won't destroy
these relationships

30:07.272 --> 30:08.739
if we can find another way.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.037
Now, if we could attach
transport enhancers

30:11.109 --> 30:12.076
onto Tom and Harry,

30:12.177 --> 30:14.907
would that be enough
to cut through the interference?

30:14.979 --> 30:16.241
l believe so.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.576
Good.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.776
Then, we just need to get
someone close to them.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.045
Doctor.

30:21.119 --> 30:24.247
A few words of inspiration
should get me within reach.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.381
l suggest you use
your mobile emitter.

30:26.457 --> 30:28.755
lt'll isolate you
from the malfunctions.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.419
Good idea.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.429
Stand by to cut power
to the holo- grid,

30:32.497 --> 30:34.055
in case things get out of hand.

30:34.132 --> 30:35.156
Aye, Captain.

30:35.233 --> 30:36.325
ln the meantime,

30:36.434 --> 30:38.629
l believe your flock
needs tending.

30:40.572 --> 30:44.303
Ex labis caelstium sanctorum

30:44.375 --> 30:50.143
super ad aures atorum
larvarum mentientium.

30:50.215 --> 30:52.581
From the lips
of the heavenly saints above

30:52.650 --> 30:53.981
to the ears of the dark

30:54.052 --> 30:55.747
and lying spirits- -

30:55.820 --> 30:57.185
may your spectral forms

30:57.255 --> 31:01.248
be cast back to the otherworld!

31:05.530 --> 31:08.090
Back to the otherworld!

31:09.901 --> 31:13.166
There must be some trick
to these incantations.

31:13.271 --> 31:15.501
What do you make of this,
Seamus?

31:18.743 --> 31:20.335
We should just
tell them the truth.

31:20.411 --> 31:21.378
Oh, good idea, Harry.

31:21.446 --> 31:22.538
Do you want to tell them

31:22.614 --> 31:24.241
they're only holograms,
or should l?

31:24.315 --> 31:27.580
l see you left your box
of charms at Sullivan's.

31:27.652 --> 31:30.917
l believe this is the talisman
you used on Maggie.

31:30.989 --> 31:33.423
Maybe we should turn
them into cows.

31:34.659 --> 31:37.856
No, no, there's been
a misunderstanding.

31:37.929 --> 31:40.090
We are not spirit folk.

31:41.199 --> 31:43.667
l think we've heard enough
of your lies, Tommy- Boy.

31:43.768 --> 31:46.168
l say we tie them up
to the lamppost in the square

31:46.237 --> 31:47.636
and show them how spirit folk

31:47.705 --> 31:49.297
were dealt with
in the olden days.

31:50.441 --> 31:51.908
Leave them alone.

31:51.976 --> 31:53.841
lt's bad enough
you've got them trussed up

31:53.912 --> 31:54.936
like Christmas turkeys.

31:55.013 --> 31:56.640
There's no need
for foolish threats!

31:56.714 --> 31:58.773
You'd better watch
whose side you're on.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.283
You're not above
suspicion yourself.

32:00.385 --> 32:01.477
Oh, so we're going to start

32:01.519 --> 32:03.180
turning on one another
now, is that it?

32:03.254 --> 32:05.518
We are if you're choosing
them over your own people.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.818
Sinners!

32:08.559 --> 32:10.993
Sinners, all of you.

32:11.062 --> 32:14.554
You have the audacity
to turn a house of worship

32:14.632 --> 32:15.621
into a prison?

32:15.700 --> 32:18.100
This is where we gather
to pledge our love

32:18.202 --> 32:19.260
for our fellow man- -

32:19.370 --> 32:21.668
not condemnation.

32:21.739 --> 32:23.707
You should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

32:23.808 --> 32:26.572
Quite a rousing sermon, Father,

32:26.644 --> 32:28.703
but l'm afraid
you're not going to find

32:28.780 --> 32:30.042
too many takers tonight.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.048
Not after your
little vanishing act.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.744
lt seems Grace Declan
saw you disappear

32:34.819 --> 32:36.377
into thin air on Sunday.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.945
Aye. l'd say that sounds
a wee bit unholy.

32:39.057 --> 32:41.082
You're in league
with them, aren't you?

32:41.159 --> 32:42.524
Tie him up with the others.

32:42.593 --> 32:43.719
Listen to yourselves.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.525
You're letting confusion
and fear get the best of you.

32:49.033 --> 32:50.500
Doctor to Janeway.
What's this?

32:50.601 --> 32:52.796
Fire and brimstone
don't seem to be working.

32:52.904 --> 32:55.168
Look here, Seamus!

32:55.239 --> 32:57.571
Another talisman.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.303
Quick, get it off of him!

33:02.880 --> 33:04.245
Beam him out of there.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.682
His program's been disengaged
from the mobile emitter.

33:07.752 --> 33:10.220
And what were you planning
on doing with these?

33:10.288 --> 33:12.984
Those are the devices
that will allow us to leave.

33:13.057 --> 33:16.390
Just put them on our coats
and we'll be on our way.

33:16.461 --> 33:19.362
You'd like us to believe
that, wouldn't you?

33:19.430 --> 33:21.898
Something tells me
these are spirit charms.

33:22.000 --> 33:22.898
We pin them on you

33:23.001 --> 33:24.696
and God knows
what powers you'll have.

33:24.802 --> 33:25.700
This is no charm.

33:25.803 --> 33:27.168
lt's some kind of a machine.

33:27.238 --> 33:28.432
Oh, it doesn't matter.

33:28.539 --> 33:30.939
They won't be telling us
the truth about any of it.

33:31.075 --> 33:33.771
Oh, they'll tell us
the truth, all right.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.540
There's more than one way

33:35.613 --> 33:37.672
to pluck the wings
off a pixie.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.273
We'll induce a trance.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.444
Give me Billy Ramsey's spoon.

33:44.322 --> 33:48.452
Keep your eyes
on the silverware, Father.

33:50.495 --> 33:52.725
l hope you know
this is blasphemous.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.730
Oh, this is ridiculous.

33:55.800 --> 33:59.668
l can't be hypnotized.

34:04.842 --> 34:07.367
l can't isolate
the Doctor's program.

34:07.445 --> 34:10.846
He's been integrated
into the Fair Haven matrix.

34:10.915 --> 34:12.438
He's vulnerable.

34:12.516 --> 34:14.143
Tell us the words.

34:14.217 --> 34:19.087
How do we banish the spirit folk
to the otherworld?

34:19.223 --> 34:22.248
There is no otherworld.

34:22.326 --> 34:24.418
Only Voyager.

34:24.495 --> 34:25.393
''Voyager''?

34:25.463 --> 34:28.556
Federation Starship,
lntrepid- class,

34:28.632 --> 34:32.000
registry number NCC- 7 4656.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.230
You're from some sort of vessel?

34:34.338 --> 34:35.464
Mm- hmm.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.473
He's talking gibberish.

34:37.542 --> 34:38.702
Maybe he's not.

34:38.775 --> 34:39.902
This ship of yours- -

34:39.976 --> 34:41.444
is that where you took me?

34:41.545 --> 34:42.877
Look here.

34:42.947 --> 34:46.713
lt says if you can get a spirit
to reveal his true name,

34:46.784 --> 34:50.219
you'll render yourself
impervious to his charms.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.946
What is your true name?

34:53.024 --> 34:55.618
l haven't decided on one yet.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.419
Katie's on that ship, isn't she?

34:58.496 --> 34:59.724
Tell me where to find her,

34:59.797 --> 35:01.492
so l can get
to the bottom of this.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.362
l'm sorry, Michael.
l can't do that.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.301
Then l guess l'm asking
the wrong person.

35:10.341 --> 35:12.400
Tell me how to get to Voyager.

35:12.510 --> 35:13.499
No, Michael.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.635
What are you doing, Sullivan?

35:14.712 --> 35:15.872
No man who's gone
to the otherworld

35:16.013 --> 35:16.877
has ever come back.

35:17.014 --> 35:18.709
l have.

35:21.519 --> 35:23.510
How do l get there?

35:30.728 --> 35:34.596
Captain, the mobile emitter
has been activated.

35:34.665 --> 35:36.599
Lock on to the signal.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.037
l had a cousin, went to America.

35:50.114 --> 35:52.480
He saw some strange things...

35:52.550 --> 35:53.676
but nothing like this.

35:55.753 --> 35:58.051
You're not in America.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.317
This is a starship.

36:04.395 --> 36:05.384
lt's called...

36:05.463 --> 36:07.727
Voyager.

36:07.798 --> 36:09.823
l know.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.970
Should l transfer him
back to the holodeck?

36:13.070 --> 36:15.095
No.

36:20.611 --> 36:23.603
My name isn't Katie O'Clare.

36:23.681 --> 36:26.514
lt's Kathryn Janeway.

36:26.584 --> 36:28.711
Captain Kathryn Janeway.

36:28.786 --> 36:32.153
lt's going to be difficult
to explain.

36:32.223 --> 36:34.851
Maybe it's best
if l just show you.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.484
You've seen my world.

36:36.561 --> 36:41.157
lt seems fair that l should
have a chance to see yours.

36:41.232 --> 36:42.358
Captain?

36:56.681 --> 36:59.616
So this really is a starship.

36:59.684 --> 37:01.948
But how can that be possible?

37:02.053 --> 37:05.216
Have you ever read
The Time Machine

37:05.256 --> 37:06.553
by H. G. Wells?

37:06.624 --> 37:09.821
Are you telling me you've
traveled back through time?

37:09.927 --> 37:11.827
ln a manner of speaking.

37:17.802 --> 37:20.066
That's Patrick Gibson
and his cousin, Frank.

37:20.171 --> 37:21.365
They work on the wharf.

37:21.472 --> 37:23.440
They're in my pub
every Saturday night

37:23.541 --> 37:24.803
for the rings tournament.

37:24.875 --> 37:28.072
You'll find a lot
of familiar faces on Voyager.

37:28.145 --> 37:30.136
We've been visiting
your town for months.

37:30.214 --> 37:31.374
Why?

37:34.118 --> 37:36.484
We're explorers.

37:36.554 --> 37:39.148
l- l'm not letting you
off the hook that easy,

37:39.223 --> 37:40.190
Kathryn Janeway.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.249
There must be more
interesting places

37:42.326 --> 37:43.759
to explore than Fair Haven.

37:43.828 --> 37:46.058
Can you think of any place
you'd rather be?

37:46.130 --> 37:49.099
l guess that leaves
but one question.

37:49.166 --> 37:52.761
How long are you
planning on staying?

37:52.870 --> 37:54.269
Well, that depends...

37:54.338 --> 37:56.431
if we're still welcome.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.508
My door is always open.

37:59.910 --> 38:01.741
But you're the Captain
of a starship.

38:01.846 --> 38:03.211
l'm a barkeep.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.713
Just because we're
from different worlds

38:07.785 --> 38:10.219
doesn't mean we can't
care for each other.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.687
Tuvok to Janeway.

38:11.756 --> 38:12.814
Go ahead.

38:12.923 --> 38:15.255
The situation has escalated.

38:15.326 --> 38:18.261
The townspeople have started
to pile kindling

38:18.329 --> 38:21.628
at the base of three lampposts
in the village square.

38:21.699 --> 38:23.064
Stand by.

38:27.872 --> 38:28.839
Take them outside now!

38:33.110 --> 38:34.168
Stay back!

38:34.245 --> 38:35.837
What are you doing?

38:35.913 --> 38:38.006
That might not be
Michael Sullivan.

38:38.082 --> 38:40.175
A demon could have
taken his shape!

38:40.251 --> 38:41.513
lt's me, Milo.

38:41.585 --> 38:43.849
l've been to the place
they call Voyager,

38:43.921 --> 38:45.411
and l've brought
Katie back with me.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.979
l've come in hopes that we

38:47.058 --> 38:49.390
can resolve our differences
peacefully.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.392
Peacefully?

38:50.461 --> 38:52.053
l'm sure that's what
you told the people

38:52.129 --> 38:53.153
of Kilmanin.

38:53.230 --> 38:55.630
They had nothing to do
with what happened in Kilmanin,

38:55.700 --> 38:56.894
if it happened at all.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.366
We're truly sorry
for what's happened here.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.233
We never meant
to frighten anyone.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.637
Seamus, you were right
about one thing.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.039
They are quite different
from us.

39:05.109 --> 39:07.441
But not in so many ways
that we can't be friends.

39:07.511 --> 39:10.446
And we're not spirit folk.

39:10.514 --> 39:13.779
Some of our technology
may seem like magic,

39:13.851 --> 39:15.944
but l assure you it's not.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.078
Katie showed me things

39:17.154 --> 39:18.815
that are beyond
our comprehension.

39:18.956 --> 39:21.720
They have machines that
l can't begin to describe,

39:21.792 --> 39:24.659
but not once have they
used them against us.

39:24.729 --> 39:26.754
Quite the opposite, in fact.

39:26.831 --> 39:30.028
Milo, you said you
didn't like the rain.

39:30.134 --> 39:33.194
And young Harry Kim
made it go away.

39:33.304 --> 39:35.329
Edith Mulcahey herself

39:35.439 --> 39:37.373
said that Katie O'Clare
pulled her daughter

39:37.441 --> 39:38.965
from the well
and out of harm's way.

39:39.076 --> 39:42.204
These are not the deeds
of spirits and mischief- makers.

39:42.279 --> 39:44.042
But they turned Maggie
into a cow!

39:44.115 --> 39:46.276
Uh, that'll never happen again.

39:46.350 --> 39:47.510
l swear.

39:47.585 --> 39:49.246
There, you see- -

39:49.320 --> 39:50.685
we have his word.

39:50.755 --> 39:53.280
And if we can't trust
a man's word in Fair Haven,

39:53.357 --> 39:55.291
what can we trust?

39:55.359 --> 39:57.293
lf you want...

39:57.361 --> 40:00.057
we'll leave
and never bother you again.

40:01.866 --> 40:05.734
But we'd prefer to find some way
to keep our friendship alive.

40:15.980 --> 40:18.210
Captain?

40:21.085 --> 40:23.451
l, for one, would like
to keep playing rings

40:23.521 --> 40:24.818
with Harry and Tom.

40:24.889 --> 40:27.790
Keep having Neelix's
steamed cabbage

40:27.858 --> 40:29.792
at The Ox and Lamb,

40:29.860 --> 40:32.021
keep taking walks with Katie.

40:33.364 --> 40:35.764
Let's not turn our backs
on these good people.

40:35.833 --> 40:38.028
lf we do,
we're only punishing ourselves.

40:40.504 --> 40:43.564
Just because we're
from different worlds,

40:43.674 --> 40:47.007
doesn't mean we can't
care for each other.

40:53.651 --> 40:55.141
lf we're going
to retain the program,

40:55.219 --> 40:57.016
we can't keep running
it around the clock.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.146
Not until we've repaired
these damaged systems.

40:59.223 --> 41:00.520
Not ever!

41:00.624 --> 41:02.387
We've pushed the limits
of holo- technology

41:02.426 --> 41:03.688
and they've pushed back.

41:03.761 --> 41:05.752
lf we try it again,
we're just asking for trouble.

41:05.830 --> 41:08.162
l'm afraid we're
going to have to close

41:08.232 --> 41:09.631
your open door policy.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.634
Yes, ma'am.

41:11.735 --> 41:13.635
What about the characters?

41:13.704 --> 41:15.797
Should l purge their memories
of the last few days?

41:15.906 --> 41:17.669
No. Leave them.

41:17.741 --> 41:20.471
They think we're space men
from the future.

41:20.544 --> 41:22.774
lt won't exactly
be like old times.

41:22.847 --> 41:25.907
We learn to accept alien species
with new technologies.

41:25.983 --> 41:27.883
Let's hope
the people of Fair Haven

41:27.952 --> 41:29.283
will learn to accept us.

41:29.353 --> 41:32.379
But before we shut down
the program and begin repairs,

41:32.456 --> 41:35.220
what do you say
to one more round at Sullivan's?

41:35.292 --> 41:37.226
My treat.

41:39.296 --> 41:41.093
You may be from the moon,
Tommy- Boy,

41:41.165 --> 41:42.564
but l've got three shillings

41:42.633 --> 41:44.726
that says l can still
whip you at rings.

41:44.835 --> 41:45.893
Ho! You're on.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.436
Hello, Harry.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.904
l'll catch up with you later.

41:48.973 --> 41:50.873
Tommy- Boy!

41:50.941 --> 41:53.739
l've been told there's a pot
of gold somewhere in Glen Abbey.

41:53.811 --> 41:55.005
Would you be able to find it

41:55.145 --> 41:57.010
with one of those fancy machines
of yours?

41:57.114 --> 41:58.809
Just follow the rainbow,
Seamus.

41:58.883 --> 42:00.009
Rainbow, eh?

42:00.050 --> 42:02.109
l didn't think you'd ever
speak to me again.

42:02.186 --> 42:04.245
Well, l suppose l can
forgive and forget.

42:04.321 --> 42:05.686
lt's not that often you meet

42:05.756 --> 42:07.690
a handsome young man
from outer space.

42:13.264 --> 42:14.822
What's this,
Christmas come early?

42:14.899 --> 42:15.888
lt has for you.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.126
Open it.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.671
A Connecticut Yankee
in King Arthur's Court

42:24.742 --> 42:26.710
by Mark Twain.

42:26.777 --> 42:29.678
l've read some of his books,
but not this one.

42:29.747 --> 42:33.114
lt's about two people
from different times

42:33.183 --> 42:36.152
who fall in love,
among other things.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.346
Sounds familiar.

42:37.421 --> 42:38.979
Maybe l have read it.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.456
Thank you, Katie.

42:41.525 --> 42:43.390
Or Kathryn now, is it?

42:43.460 --> 42:44.825
Oh!

42:44.895 --> 42:47.295
They say if you know
a spirit's true name,

42:47.364 --> 42:52.063
that it renders you impervious
against her charms.

42:52.169 --> 42:53.636
Do you think there's
any truth in that?

42:53.737 --> 42:54.863
Not a word.

42:54.972 --> 42:56.405
l'm glad to hear it.
