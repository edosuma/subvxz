00:24.942 --> 00:28.855
J‘J‘ Hit the ground running
and never looked back J‘J‘

00:30.948 --> 00:33.860
J‘J‘ Steered my eyes
to the mission ahead J‘J‘

00:34.076 --> 00:36.943
J‘J‘ And I burnt that bridge J‘J‘

00:43.336 --> 00:47.830
J‘J‘ Never did listen

J‘J‘ Surrendered my soul

[Martha] You've reached
the Longmire residence.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.193
Sorry we 're not here
to take your call.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.612
Please leave a message. We 'II
be happy to call you back.

This is Walt.

This is Walt.

[rock music playing]

04:01.701 --> 04:03.783
[indistinct conversations]

04:09.166 --> 04:10.702
[man]
18 gaming tables

04:10.918 --> 04:12.704
and over 800
state-of-the-art slot machines.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.833
It's opening day at
Four Arrows Resort and Casi--

04:28.561 --> 04:30.677
Ruby, send Ferg down.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.594
[vehicle door closes]

04:44.910 --> 04:46.901
-Walt!
-Ferg.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.787
That's nice.
Where'd you buy this from?

04:55.004 --> 04:56.494
I didn't.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.758
You got it.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.416
We weren't expecting you
till Monday.

05:02.636 --> 05:06.299
Well, I figured
with the casino opening,

05:06.515 --> 05:08.767
you could use
an extra hand, so...

05:10.603 --> 05:12.139
The resort's only half-done,

05:12.354 --> 05:13.855
so all the hotels
are overbooked.

05:14.732 --> 05:16.063
Even the campground's full.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.561
-Oh, hey! Whoa.
-[horn honks]

05:18.778 --> 05:20.188
Coming through.

06:15.668 --> 06:18.159
So, how you doin'?

06:18.379 --> 06:20.165
[grunts]
Right now?

06:20.381 --> 06:21.837
I'm carrying most
of the weight, so...

06:22.049 --> 06:23.459
Okay.

06:23.676 --> 06:24.791
Okay.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.513
-Hold up.
-Yep.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.051
[groans]
Who locked the door?

06:37.523 --> 06:39.184
Walt. Hey.

06:40.109 --> 06:43.067
Um, we weren't expecting you
till Monday.

06:43.279 --> 06:44.610
[Walt]
So I've heard.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.155
[Vic] Sorry.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.232
I, um -- I wasn't, like,
sitting at your desk.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.660
| just needed some room
to spread out, so...

06:53.873 --> 06:55.864
You don't need to apologize,
Vic.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.914
I left you in charge, so...

07:02.673 --> 07:04.709
Here you go, boss.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.301
Oh.

07:06.510 --> 07:09.126
Well, I guess this should be
for you, boss.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.722
-|s it Monday already?
-[chuck|es]

07:10.931 --> 07:11.886
I'm sorry.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.259
Who are you?

07:13.475 --> 07:15.761
[Vic]
This is, uh, Eamonn O'Neill.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.185
He's on loan from Cumberland
County. I sent you his résumé.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.352
You approved him.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.938
[Eamonn]
You survived the feds.

07:22.151 --> 07:23.140
Congratulations.

07:23.694 --> 07:26.436
Well, they were just doing
their job, so...

07:26.655 --> 07:28.361
Well, at least you're
no longer suspended.

07:28.574 --> 07:29.814
[Walt]
Never was.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.650
Just a voluntary leave
of absence.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.406
I-Vic?
-[V|c] Yeah?

07:34.622 --> 07:36.237
There's been an accident.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.412
Ah.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.365
Hello, Walter.

07:39.585 --> 07:43.498
Uh, well, out on Route 10,
by mile marker 20.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.625
-Okay. We got it.
-Yep.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.547
Ferg.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.717
Thank God you're back.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.725
[up-tempo music plays,
indistinct conversations]

08:10.532 --> 08:12.443
Hey, let me get a burger
and bottle of water.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.649
It's roasting out there.

08:13.869 --> 08:14.949
[Henry]
Merwin Tall Grass.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.198
I did not peg you
as a Ghost Dancer.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.995
My grandfather made me learn.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.574
He said if we danced long
enough, we'd fall into a trance,

08:21.794 --> 08:24.752
and when we woke up,
all the white men would be gone.

08:24.964 --> 08:27.296
[Henry] Your grandfather did not
count on Jacob Nighthorse.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.590
His casino makes
white men multiply.

08:29.802 --> 08:31.383
As long as they bring
their cash.

08:41.105 --> 08:42.436
Merwin.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.773
I'm spreading the word
about a new group.

08:46.986 --> 08:49.819
We have started a chapter of
Man Up at the community center.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.566
I am on
the recruitment committee.

08:51.782 --> 08:52.942
[Merwin]
Man Up?

08:53.158 --> 08:55.820
I heard that's like A.A.
for wife-heaters.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.537
They do many things
for the community,

08:57.746 --> 09:00.328
though domestic violence
is certainly a focus.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.328
Why would you be asking me
to join something like this?

09:04.795 --> 09:06.331
I am asking everybody.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.627
Sure, man.
I'll check it out.

09:11.844 --> 09:13.505
Mondays at 8:00.

09:20.436 --> 09:21.642
[horns honking]

09:21.854 --> 09:24.015
[Lucian] Come on through!
Come on through!

09:24.231 --> 09:26.722
Come on! Get it out!
Get the lead out!

09:26.942 --> 09:28.148
Come on!

09:28.360 --> 09:29.691
Okay, grease monkeys
and roughnecks,

09:29.903 --> 09:31.279
stay on that side of the road!

09:31.488 --> 09:33.900
Holy rollers,
get that circle going!

09:34.116 --> 09:35.401
Go through!
Go! Go! Go!

09:35.617 --> 09:37.027
Move it!
Move it!

09:37.244 --> 09:38.745
Yes, indeed!

09:38.954 --> 09:41.195
Get your butt moving over here!
Come on!

09:41.415 --> 09:42.951
Use the right foot, brother!

09:43.167 --> 09:46.375
Half-naked girls, get off
the road, get off the road!

09:46.587 --> 09:48.043
[Lucian] Come on, now, girls,
this ain't no place

09:48.255 --> 09:49.586
for your bachelorette party.

09:49.798 --> 09:50.913
Move it!
Move it!

09:51.133 --> 09:53.169
Come on by!
Come on! Come on!

09:53.385 --> 09:54.921
Come on! Come on! Come on!

09:55.137 --> 09:57.048
Well, I'm glad
you could make it.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.300
Lucian, what are you doing here?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.052
I'm just helping out
the department.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.133
Your acting sheriff
looked a little overwhelmed,

10:03.353 --> 10:05.344
what with you gone and these
degenerates come to town.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.225
[Vic]
Damn it, Lucian!

10:07.441 --> 10:09.056
He has been sitting by the
scanner since you've been gone.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.891
-We don't need your help!
-[Lucian] Oh, righty-dighty,

10:11.111 --> 10:12.146
'cause you got your
little studly over there

10:12.362 --> 10:14.068
on loan from Cumberland County.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.070
-What's he got I don't got?
-The ability to listen.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.489
[Lucian] Come on!
Come on through!

10:17.701 --> 10:19.737
Hot cops! Whoo, whoo!

10:19.953 --> 10:21.409
Come on! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

10:21.622 --> 10:23.078
Move it! Move it! Move it!

10:23.290 --> 10:25.121
Anyway, Walt,
I got everything under control.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.825
There ain't nobody hurt
and definitely nobody shot.

10:30.172 --> 10:32.163
What -- What the heck happened?

10:32.382 --> 10:33.542
Seems these dewy young ladies

10:33.759 --> 10:35.465
driving down here
from Minneapolis

10:35.677 --> 10:38.510
on a last, final prenuptial
hurrah or something.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.839
Yon casino bus tries to pass
them on this double yellow.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.924
Another car's coming
in the other lane.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.601
Bus tries to come back
into his own lane,

10:46.814 --> 10:49.396
hits the RV party thing,
and runs it right off the road.

10:49.608 --> 10:53.692
It's like a strip club
threw up on a Barbie camper.

10:55.114 --> 10:57.446
-The driver of the RV?
-Sober as a Mormon.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.273
All them other girls
bear out that story.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.199
What about
the casino bus driver?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.117
[Lucian] Here's where it
gets interesting, Walt.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.036
Bus driver gets out the bus,
opens the doors,

11:05.249 --> 11:08.241
pulls out all the luggage on the
ground, and then skedaddles.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.416
He's an ugly mutt.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.039
Randolph Hale.

11:12.256 --> 11:14.121
These charters don't care
who they hire anymore.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.332
My bet --
There's a record on him.

11:16.552 --> 11:17.883
Probably afraid
of getting arrested,

11:18.095 --> 11:19.505
heads for the tall grass.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.427
Lucian, we appreciate your help.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.971
We got it from here.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.515
-Well, if I'm off work -- Ferg!
-Yes, sir?

11:25.727 --> 11:26.853
I'm devoid of a drink!

11:27.062 --> 11:28.973
Where's my drink?
Give me my drink!

11:29.189 --> 11:30.520
Whoo!

11:30.732 --> 11:33.644
Off the road, off the road,
off the road!

11:34.862 --> 11:36.022
Stay off the road!

11:37.114 --> 11:38.604
I filed a report with your boss.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.530
Insurance better cover this
because that maniac

11:40.742 --> 11:42.278
almost took off our fender.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.359
There's a service station
three miles up the road.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.366
Get them to check it
before you head out of town.

11:46.582 --> 11:47.992
Yeah.
We're gonna go to the casino.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.164
Um, I've been the
designated driver for two days,

11:50.377 --> 11:51.537
and I need a drink, so...

12:20.741 --> 12:22.606
[sighs]

12:32.711 --> 12:33.996
What you got there?

12:37.883 --> 12:38.872
[Vic]
Oh, Jesus.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.595
Ferg, put out an APB

12:48.810 --> 12:51.643
on that bus driver --
Randolph Hale.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.312
He can't have got far,
even if he hitched.

12:55.359 --> 12:56.940
Late teens, early 20$.

13:00.239 --> 13:03.106
There's no ID. or wallet
that I can see.

13:04.243 --> 13:07.781
Vic, get this girl to the
morgue, find out who she is.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.074
I'm going to the casino

13:10.290 --> 13:13.657
to have a word
with... Archer Loftus,

13:13.877 --> 13:17.119
who seems to have misplaced
his luggage.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.129
I'll go with Vic, then?

13:19.341 --> 13:21.047
She can't carry that bag
by herself.

13:27.266 --> 13:28.301
[sighs]

13:43.824 --> 13:45.735
[drumbeats,
indistinct conversations]

14:25.741 --> 14:26.776
Henry.

14:28.452 --> 14:29.567
What are you doing here?

14:29.786 --> 14:31.117
My new boss -- Malachi --

14:31.330 --> 14:33.867
generously offered
my catering services.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.458
What is your excuse?

14:35.667 --> 14:37.532
I'm here on business.

14:38.754 --> 14:42.463
I hoped this day would never
come, for Martha's sake.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.336
It is what it is.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.766
[horn honks]

14:56.938 --> 14:59.065
[indistinct conversations]

15:13.622 --> 15:15.237
Put it on my bill.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.707
Hey, I'm gonna have to
catch up with you later.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.705
Good talking to you.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.161
Nice meeting you.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.085
Wow.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.132
You just couldn't stay away,
huh?

15:28.345 --> 15:31.382
What is it now? You want to
check the smoke detectors?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.589
I'm not here to make trouble.

15:33.809 --> 15:36.266
I just need to talk
to one of your guests.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.389
Archer Loftus.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.311
Came in on the charter bus
about an hour ago.

15:40.524 --> 15:42.230
I was hoping you could help me
find him.

15:43.985 --> 15:47.113
You know, I'm not doing
a damn thing for you, my man,

15:47.322 --> 15:48.983
not until you give me something.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.359
What's that?

15:50.575 --> 15:52.031
An apology.

15:52.244 --> 15:53.825
You're kidding.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.949
Shall I call Malachi and have
you escorted out of here?

16:01.753 --> 16:05.371
I'm sorry
that my deeply held belief

16:05.590 --> 16:10.505
that you are a dishonorable,
untrustworthy person

16:10.720 --> 16:14.087
led me to falsely accuse you
of killing Branch Connally.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.591
And your wife.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.936
And my wife.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.139
I now know it was Barlow.

16:23.358 --> 16:26.475
The rich, white man
turns out to be the bad guy.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.481
What a shock, eh?

16:30.115 --> 16:32.071
Now will you help me?

16:34.619 --> 16:36.325
Let's go to my office.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.247
For the record, Walt, that was

16:41.460 --> 16:43.416
the worst apology
I've ever received.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.788
-It was honest.
-Yeah.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.495
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

16:46.715 --> 16:49.502
Barlow is still screwing me
from beyond the grave.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.333
-I thought he was your partner.
-He was.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.009
But with his money
tied up in probate,

16:53.221 --> 16:55.382
I can't complete construction
of the hotel.

16:55.599 --> 16:58.011
I need the revenue from
this casino more than ever.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.217
-Do you understand me?
-I think so.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.677
Well, let me make it clear.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.307
If I allow you
to question my patrons,

17:03.523 --> 17:05.639
anything you learn
is kept inside your office,

17:05.859 --> 17:08.566
away from the public
and especially the press.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.234
Can't afford to have people
scared off,

17:10.447 --> 17:12.654
thinking this place
attracts criminal activity.

17:12.866 --> 17:13.901
You have my word.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.323
Well, if Loftus has checked in

17:15.535 --> 17:17.071
to the completed wing
of the hotel,

17:17.287 --> 17:18.948
I'll have him brought here.
It's been my experience

17:19.164 --> 17:23.077
that free chips and a meal
voucher add a little incentive.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.117
Thank you, Jacob.

17:25.337 --> 17:26.827
Don't thank me.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.753
I'm not paying for it.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.766
Cade Tall Grass, yes?

17:45.982 --> 17:47.062
Yeah.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.942
What are you doing out here
all by yourself?

17:52.197 --> 17:54.734
I had to get some things.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.281
My mom's sick.

17:56.493 --> 17:59.109
Your dad was not around
to take you?

17:59.329 --> 18:01.035
[Cade]
He took the car to work.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.411
[Henry]
It is along walk.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.993
Hop in.
Let me give you a ride.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.015
[Walt]
Archer Loftus.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.775
This is you, right?

18:35.365 --> 18:36.696
Yeah, that's me.
Why?

18:36.908 --> 18:39.490
You came in on the charter bus
from Oden?

18:39.703 --> 18:42.661
Yep.
Work on the oil rigs over there.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.033
Couple days' leave, came here.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.706
So, when do I get my chips?

18:47.752 --> 18:50.459
You own a black duffel bag,
Mr. Loftus?

18:50.672 --> 18:54.381
No. A red Samsonite
upstairs in my room.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.049
A woman's body was found

18:56.261 --> 18:59.628
in a black duffel bag
with this tag on it.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.429
You're saying it isn't yours?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.347
A woman's body?

19:04.477 --> 19:06.183
You mean like a dead woman?

19:08.523 --> 19:10.184
With my name on it?

19:12.611 --> 19:14.101
Holy hell.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.606
Oh!

19:15.822 --> 19:18.814
I knew it!
This whole trip was a setup!

19:19.784 --> 19:22.070
"You've been doing
such good work, Archer.

19:22.287 --> 19:26.075
We want to reward you
for your loyalty to the company.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.997
We'll give you a bus ticket
and some chips

19:28.209 --> 19:30.120
and a dead woman's body
in a bag,

19:30.337 --> 19:31.998
get rid of your ass
once and for all."

19:32.213 --> 19:33.919
Settle down, Mr. Loftus.

19:34.132 --> 19:36.965
I've called OSHA half a dozen
times on this company's ass.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.714
They got us wildcatting
out there.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.386
Long hours, skipping breaks,
no rest for the hands.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.089
That's because the company
only gets paid

19:44.309 --> 19:45.719
when the kelly's turning.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.187
How do you know that?

19:51.399 --> 19:53.560
Oh, spent a few years
working rigs,

19:53.777 --> 19:55.984
mostly roughnecking in Alaska.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.652
Prudhoe Bay.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.776
Then you know when time
is money, men get hurt.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.573
Five in the last eight months.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.276
You think someone
at the oil company

20:04.496 --> 20:06.111
is trying to frame you,
Mr. Loftus?

20:06.331 --> 20:09.073
Would I put my own
return address on a dead body?

20:09.292 --> 20:10.702
Who else would?

20:13.088 --> 20:15.044
Must be 20 men on that bus

20:15.256 --> 20:18.384
happily take a grand
to screw me over.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.514
Loose tooth?

20:26.726 --> 20:27.806
If I can get it out,

20:28.019 --> 20:30.010
I'll get a dollar
under my pillow.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.472
In my day, the tooth fairy
left only a quarter.

20:33.692 --> 20:35.273
Your mom was cheap.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.225
I know who the tooth fairy is.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.691
You are a sharp young man.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.613
[Cade]
You can drop me here.

20:42.826 --> 20:45.818
My dad doesn't like visitors,
especially when Mom's sick.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.832
I hope your mom gets well soon,
Cade.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.444
Any word on
the missing bus driver?

21:28.663 --> 21:30.995
No, not yet.
But Lucian was right.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.743
Randolph Hale
has a warrant out --

21:32.959 --> 21:34.244
failure to pay child support.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.247
[Walt]
Any credit-card activity?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.795
No, but, you know, since the guy
is a driver by trade,

21:38.965 --> 21:40.421
I put a call out on the CB

21:40.633 --> 21:42.760
to check to see
if any truckers spot him.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.584
Did you find the guy
with the duffel?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.465
Well, he says he's being framed.

21:46.681 --> 21:49.639
Uh, how's Vic coming
with the ID. of the girl?

21:49.851 --> 21:51.591
She's still at the coroner's
with Eamonn.

21:54.272 --> 21:57.264
What do you think of, uh,
Deputy O'Neill?

21:57.484 --> 21:58.815
He's not bad.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.525
Vic seems to like him.

22:01.738 --> 22:05.902
Let's hope Vic's having
some luck getting that I.D.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.527
I'll check in later.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.787
Thank you.

22:13.291 --> 22:14.622
[camera shutter clicks]

22:14.834 --> 22:16.620
[Vic] Blunt-force trauma
to the back of the head,

22:16.836 --> 22:21.045
no sign of sexual assault,
no identifying marks.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.964
What girl this age
doesn't have a tattoo?

22:24.177 --> 22:25.792
Oh, you have a tattoo?

22:26.012 --> 22:27.548
Wouldn't you like to know?

22:27.764 --> 22:29.425
[Eamonn]
What about implants?

22:29.641 --> 22:30.801
Excuse me?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.598
[chuckles]
The girl.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.426
Breast implants,
they have serial numbers.

22:34.646 --> 22:35.681
Maybe we can trace them.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.762
Yeah. Okay.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.240
I am no expert,
but they look pretty real to me.

22:46.449 --> 22:49.031
I don't think your boss
likes me.

22:49.244 --> 22:50.734
Oh, come on.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.660
Walt just had to kill a guy
in his front yard,

22:52.872 --> 22:55.249
a guy that murdered his own son
and killed Walt's wife.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.995
I think he's got bigger things
on his mind than you.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.542
Yeah, I know. I know.
You're right.

22:59.754 --> 23:00.834
I just -- I like it around here.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.503
I wouldn't mind sticking around,

23:02.715 --> 23:05.843
but that's not likely
if Walt thinks I'm an ass.

23:07.470 --> 23:10.587
He'll forget all about it
if we get him a positive |.D.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.389
[slot-machine music playing]

23:21.609 --> 23:22.815
Oh, wait!
Hey, hey.

23:23.027 --> 23:25.018
Don't sneak up on a man
like that.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.820
Lady Luck is skittish.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.819
-Lucian, I need your help.
-My help?

23:31.035 --> 23:33.697
Why don't you just drag that
new deputy away from Moretti?

23:33.913 --> 23:35.574
I'm too busy
hitting the jackpot.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.490
Unless he is, too.

23:38.710 --> 23:41.793
We found a woman's body
at the scene of the accident.

23:42.005 --> 23:44.291
She was in a duffel bag
with a luggage tag on it

23:44.507 --> 23:46.714
saying it belonged
to an Archer Loftus.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.042
Dirty business, casinos.

23:51.389 --> 23:53.380
If this oil worker didn't do it,

23:53.600 --> 23:56.057
then someone else on that bus
may be trying to frame him.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.884
You were out at that accident.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.436
You can help me track down
all the passengers on the bus.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.024
Walt, you dismissed me,
remember?

24:02.233 --> 24:03.689
Why don't you just get on
the damn P.A.

24:03.902 --> 24:05.608
and wrangle everybody
who was out there?

24:06.571 --> 24:09.313
I promised Nighthorse
I wouldn't take this public.

24:13.286 --> 24:14.776
You promised Nighthorse.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.827
Now, why would you do that?

24:17.040 --> 24:17.995
I owe him.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.538
Owe him what?

24:19.751 --> 24:21.332
I accused him of something
he didn't do.

24:21.544 --> 24:22.875
Accused him of what?

24:23.087 --> 24:25.669
Killing Martha and Branch.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.247
Right.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.673
But that would be my brother.

24:28.885 --> 24:29.965
Save it.

24:32.263 --> 24:35.005
I believe there's some young
bachelorettes need questioning.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.839
Focus on the bus.

24:38.186 --> 24:39.141
[chuckles]

24:39.354 --> 24:41.140
Greedy, greedy, greedy.

J‘J‘ Or shut up
and get off the stage II

25:02.168 --> 25:03.749
Hey, Henry.

25:03.962 --> 25:05.077
Hello, Ferg.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.581
This is Randolph Hale.
He's a bus driver.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.507
You haven't seen him here
tonight, have you?

25:11.719 --> 25:13.505
That is not a face
I would forget.

25:13.721 --> 25:16.463
Just keep an eye out,
give us a call if you spot him.

25:18.977 --> 25:20.308
-Jess.
-[Jess] Yeah?

25:20.520 --> 25:21.885
[Henry] If this man
comes into the bar,

25:22.105 --> 25:23.185
call the sheriff's department.

25:23.398 --> 25:25.354
Sure.

25:25.566 --> 25:30.606
N No one's gonna push when
your back's to the wall If

25:32.865 --> 25:34.071
J‘J‘ Know how to walk... J‘J‘

25:34.283 --> 25:36.319
So, you came here
with Archer Loftus?

25:36.536 --> 25:37.867
Nope.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.444
But you're part of the group
from Oden, right?

25:39.664 --> 25:41.450
Well, me and Loftus
were on the same bus,

25:41.666 --> 25:43.247
but it's not like we're friends.

25:43.459 --> 25:46.292
That dude's a whiner and a narc,
and everybody knows it.

25:46.504 --> 25:47.960
He have any friends
in the group?

25:48.172 --> 25:49.378
[scoffs] I don't think

25:49.590 --> 25:51.330
he has any friends
on this earth.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.007
Oh, one more thing.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.210
Um, do you remember seeing

25:55.430 --> 25:57.671
an attractive young woman
on the bus?

25:57.890 --> 25:59.391
-Dark hair?
-Yeah.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.556
Shit, yeah, I remember her.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.226
You see her talking to anyone?

26:04.439 --> 26:05.929
Couple guys
tried to chat her up,

26:06.149 --> 26:07.559
but she just blew them off.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.481
How'd they handle the rejection?

26:09.694 --> 26:11.776
I don't know.
Fine?

26:11.988 --> 26:14.775
Listen, can I go back in?
I only got a couple days.

26:14.991 --> 26:17.698
I don't want to waste it talking
to some dude in a parking lot.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.865
Sure.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.369
Oh, hey, Sheriff.

Excuse me, uh, Chelsea.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.848
How do you know my name?
You're so Sherlock-y.

26:42.060 --> 26:45.302
Well, it's kind of hard to miss.
Uh, written on your glass, so...

26:46.564 --> 26:48.179
-Do me next.
-[|aughter]

26:48.399 --> 26:50.890
-Um, well, I'm sorry
to interrupt,

26:51.110 --> 26:53.852
but I need to ask if any of you

26:54.072 --> 26:55.687
saw someone
tampering with the luggage

26:55.907 --> 26:57.192
at the crash site this morning.

26:57.408 --> 26:58.818
Why?
What happened?

26:59.035 --> 27:00.525
Well, a crime's been committed.

27:00.745 --> 27:03.657
We just need to talk
to everybody that was there.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.865
Any of you notice anything
or anyone odd or...

27:07.085 --> 27:10.669
By "anyone odd," do you mean
anyone acting like an asshole?

27:10.880 --> 27:13.587
Yeah, yeah, I think
that would qualify.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.711
Okay, let's start
with the bus driver.

27:15.927 --> 27:17.542
Okay. Let's.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.548
The whole accident
was his fault.

27:19.764 --> 27:20.844
He wouldn't even apologize
for it,

27:21.057 --> 27:22.638
and when I asked
for his insurance,

27:22.850 --> 27:25.182
he got really squirrelly
and wouldn't look me in the eye.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.306
Never trust a guy
who won't look you in the eye.

27:28.523 --> 27:30.104
[laughter]

27:30.316 --> 27:31.647
When was the last time
you saw him?

27:31.859 --> 27:33.815
Uh, we were in the middle
of a conversation.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.110
He said, "I have to pee,"
ran into the woods,

27:36.322 --> 27:37.903
and I never saw him again.

27:42.954 --> 27:46.071
A trucker called in on the CB
and said that this guy was here
about 20 minutes ago.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.667
Oh, I've been on since noon.
Nobody like that's been in.

27:48.876 --> 27:51.413
Where the showers at?
Okay.

27:54.257 --> 27:55.918
[bell jingles]

27:58.845 --> 28:00.085
[bell jingles]

28:03.850 --> 28:05.886
[water running]

28:09.981 --> 28:11.471
Randolph Hale?

28:19.866 --> 28:22.653
I'm looking for Randolph Hale!

28:22.869 --> 28:24.825
You're looking for who?

28:25.037 --> 28:26.743
Sorry to bother you.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.495
Randolph Hale?
Sheriff's department.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.672
Stop!
Stop right there!

28:42.680 --> 28:43.886
[bell jingles]

28:47.351 --> 28:48.887
[bell jingles]

28:59.322 --> 29:00.778
Hale!

29:00.990 --> 29:02.696
I know you're here!

29:19.091 --> 29:20.706
[door opens]

29:31.854 --> 29:33.640
All right.
You're okay.

29:50.581 --> 29:52.617
You need help.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.908
The boy wrote to me.

29:56.629 --> 29:57.618
Hector?

29:57.797 --> 30:00.004
Cade, what did you do?

30:00.216 --> 30:03.754
[Henry] Do you know the story
of the Bear Helper?

30:05.638 --> 30:09.381
He'll meet you tomorrow at noon
on the playground.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.387
Bring only
what you can't live without.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.401
[Hale] You know, I am tired
of being harassed.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.278
I haven't done anything wrong.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.782
And you can tell my ex-wife,
if I'm in jail, I can't work,

30:31.998 --> 30:34.740
and if I can't work,
I can't pay her!

30:36.127 --> 30:38.368
This Randolph Hale?

30:38.587 --> 30:39.872
In the flesh.

30:41.507 --> 30:42.496
I'm Sheriff Longmire.

30:42.717 --> 30:44.378
And I'm freezing my ass off.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.299
Your deputy wouldn't let me go
back and get my clothes.

30:46.512 --> 30:49.094
I went back.
Somebody swiped them.

30:49.307 --> 30:50.513
I'm sorry to hear that.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.261
Ferg, why don't you
go to my office

30:52.476 --> 30:54.967
and get Mr. Hale
a fleece jacket?

30:55.187 --> 30:57.348
I think I have one
in my black duffel bag.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.930
Sure thing.

31:03.946 --> 31:09.407
So, uh, do you know why we
brought you in, Mr. Hale?

31:09.618 --> 31:12.405
Yeah. Because
my damn ex-wife's a bloodsucker.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.612
I told her,
as soon as I'm paid, she's paid.

31:14.832 --> 31:16.197
I get my check next week.

31:17.293 --> 31:18.829
I'm not so sure.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.410
You fled the scene
of an accident.

31:20.629 --> 31:21.664
[sighs]

31:21.881 --> 31:23.746
Damn it.

31:23.966 --> 31:26.423
I only ran because I knew
this would happen.

31:27.720 --> 31:31.554
It ain't easy for a man my age
out there.

31:33.017 --> 31:35.508
Let -- Let me -- Let me just set
the record straight.

31:35.728 --> 31:37.343
I didn't run out on my family.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.019
My wife, she kicked me out.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.937
Now the boyfriend,
he's moving in,

31:41.150 --> 31:44.267
but she still wants her check
the 15th of every damn month.

31:45.946 --> 31:47.732
Know what?
Women, they look at you,

31:47.907 --> 31:50.819
all they see is a meal ticket.

31:56.624 --> 31:59.331
How long you been working
for the bus company, Mr. Hale?

31:59.543 --> 32:01.283
Little over a year.

32:01.504 --> 32:03.119
[Walt]
You load all the bags?

32:03.339 --> 32:05.250
Yeah.
Every single one of them.

32:05.466 --> 32:07.047
Oh.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.124
That's a lot of people
and a lot of luggage

32:09.345 --> 32:11.085
to keep track of.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.970
You remember all those folks
and who brings on what?

32:14.183 --> 32:16.970
In my line of work, you
just remember the jerks
and the heavy bags.

32:17.186 --> 32:20.804
-What do you consider heavy?
-I don't know. 50, 60 pounds?

32:22.900 --> 32:24.686
You remember this bag?

32:24.902 --> 32:26.563
I told you.
I only remember the heavy ones.

32:26.779 --> 32:30.488
Well, this was a lot heavier
before we emptied it.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.076
What do you think it weighed,
Ferg?

32:33.285 --> 32:34.411
120 pounds.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.406
120 pounds.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.908
I can't lift 120 pounds.
I'm on disability.

32:40.501 --> 32:41.786
What was in it?

32:45.172 --> 32:47.083
You recognize her?

32:49.009 --> 32:52.172
I-I ain't never seen her
or that bag before in my life.

32:53.806 --> 32:56.172
And yet another person
on your bus

32:56.392 --> 33:00.055
remembers an attractive,
young woman with dark hair.

33:01.522 --> 33:03.763
-And that bag was on your bus.
-[telephone rings]

33:04.733 --> 33:07.145
You loaded every bag.

33:08.612 --> 33:10.568
I guess now you're wishing

33:10.781 --> 33:13.488
we were holding you for skipped
child-support payments.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.824
Walt.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.901
Jacob Nighthorse for you.

33:20.082 --> 33:21.743
Yeah?

33:21.959 --> 33:24.701
So, is this your idea of keeping
Four Arrows out of the press

33:24.920 --> 33:26.456
and away from bad publicity?

33:26.672 --> 33:28.173
What are you talking about?

33:28.382 --> 33:31.590
Turn on Channel 11... or 2 or 7.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.383
They're all reporting
that a murdered girl

33:33.596 --> 33:36.133
was found on a bus
headed to my casino.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.508
I haven't spoken to anyone.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.135
Did the mother and father
call it in?

33:39.351 --> 33:41.888
No. The Absaroka County
Sheriff's Department did,

33:42.104 --> 33:44.345
seeking any and all information
about her identity.

33:44.565 --> 33:46.055
You just couldn't wait,
could you?

33:46.275 --> 33:49.267
You just had to sabotage
my opening weekend.

33:52.615 --> 33:55.072
What do you mean, you released
that information to the press?

33:55.284 --> 33:58.071
Well, the autopsy
didn't give us anything,

33:58.287 --> 33:59.868
and you weren't coming up
with anything.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.412
Okay, Walt, maybe we should have
checked with you first,

34:02.625 --> 34:05.207
but since you've been gone,
we've gotten used to do doing
things a different way.

34:05.419 --> 34:06.659
Well, I'm back.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.744
And you had no business
going around me.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.501
[Eamonn] In Cumberland,
when we hit a dead end,

34:11.717 --> 34:13.503
we do whatever we can
to identify our victim.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.084
And frankly,
any department would.

34:16.805 --> 34:19.672
Except one where the sheriff
has a special arrangement
with the casino owner.

34:19.892 --> 34:21.974
-[knock on door]
-[Ruby] We got an ID.

34:22.186 --> 34:24.518
Her name is Delia Garrett
from Minneapolis.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.971
Her friends saw her photo on
the news. Heading right down.

34:27.191 --> 34:28.931
[door closes]

34:38.661 --> 34:41.903
Well, maybe this wasn't
the right time to be right.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.440
It has to be you.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.778
What do you mean?

35:18.826 --> 35:20.066
I'm sorry.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.026
I-I have the wrong person.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.577
[Henry]
Wait.

35:29.253 --> 35:30.868
Hector sent me.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.138
Walt, Eamonn
was just doing his job.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.760
I know that the FBI
has been grilling you

35:44.977 --> 35:46.387
about protocol
for the last six weeks,

35:46.604 --> 35:47.969
so you're extra sensitive
about this,

35:48.147 --> 35:49.603
but just because
he didn't do it your way

35:49.815 --> 35:50.975
doesn't mean that he is wrong.

35:51.191 --> 35:52.692
This isn't about protocol.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.983
This is about common decency.

35:55.738 --> 35:57.148
A mother and a father found out

35:57.364 --> 35:59.025
their daughter was dead
by seeing this --

35:59.241 --> 36:01.402
an autopsy photo on TV.

36:01.619 --> 36:04.452
Walt, you got visitors.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.076
She was supposed to come
with us,

36:09.293 --> 36:10.829
but she canceled
at the last second.

36:12.463 --> 36:13.748
She say why?

36:13.964 --> 36:15.545
She said she was sick.

36:16.592 --> 36:17.957
But you didn't believe her?

36:18.177 --> 36:19.462
[Sarah]
Delia had money problems.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.293
I thought maybe she just
couldn't afford the trip

36:21.513 --> 36:22.593
and didn't want to tell us.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.512
[Logan]
That's so stupid.

36:24.725 --> 36:26.135
I would have loaned her
the money.

36:26.352 --> 36:28.217
Can you tell me the last time
you spoke to her?

36:28.437 --> 36:31.895
Yeah, um, I can tell you
exactly when.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.847
We went to pick her up
in the RV,

36:34.068 --> 36:35.774
and she wasn't there,
so I called her.

36:35.986 --> 36:37.021
[sniffles]

36:37.237 --> 36:39.068
She was at work,
but she was sick

36:39.281 --> 36:41.237
and said that we
should leave without her.

36:42.326 --> 36:44.658
7:30 pm. Thursday.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.280
Can either of you
think of a reason

36:46.497 --> 36:48.909
why Delia would be
in Absaroka County?

36:49.124 --> 36:51.115
Oh, my God.

36:51.335 --> 36:53.075
Do you think
she changed her mind

36:53.295 --> 36:55.251
and tried to catch up to us?

36:55.464 --> 36:58.080
She knew everywhere we'd
be stopping along the way.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.211
Well, does that sound like her?

37:00.427 --> 37:02.042
She was impulsive.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.923
I mean, don't get me wrong,
she was great,

37:04.139 --> 37:06.300
but she wasn't like
the rest of us.

37:06.517 --> 37:08.428
-How was she different?
-She would just disappear,

37:08.644 --> 37:10.475
and then we'd get
a postcard from,

37:10.688 --> 37:13.270
like, Turkey or Uganda
or some random place.

37:13.482 --> 37:15.097
She brought a guy back once.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.182
He didn't speak any English,
and he was just really weird.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.268
I don't really know how
to explain it,

37:19.488 --> 37:21.479
other than she just didn't
think about the consequences

37:21.699 --> 37:22.984
of her actions.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.993
So, it's possible
that she got on a bus

37:28.205 --> 37:31.914
and, uh, followed you here,
picked up a stranger on the way?

37:32.126 --> 37:33.707
Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me.

37:35.212 --> 37:36.668
[Walt]
What about this?

37:39.091 --> 37:41.173
It's backpack-y,

37:41.385 --> 37:43.467
kind of like something
Delia would have.

37:43.679 --> 37:48.389
That was found on the bus that,
uh, crashed into you yesterday.

37:49.351 --> 37:52.138
Your friend's body
was found inside it.

37:52.855 --> 37:55.437
Oh, my God.
That's horrible.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.264
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.224
You can't just do whatever
you want!

37:59.445 --> 38:01.026
Why don't you two
just wait here?

38:01.238 --> 38:03.024
I'II drive you back to your RV.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.026
I want to speak to, uh,
the rest of your friends.

38:05.242 --> 38:07.403
Maybe Delia
contacted one of them.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.745
I won't be long.

38:17.337 --> 38:21.080
Ferg, find out all you can
about Delia Garrett.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.915
Call her family, her employers.

38:23.135 --> 38:25.126
See if she got any new
or unusual men in her life.

38:25.345 --> 38:26.630
Yep.

38:31.977 --> 38:35.094
Here's a better picture
of that girl, Randolph.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.474
Now do you recognize her?

38:36.690 --> 38:39.477
I told you before, no.

38:41.570 --> 38:43.731
Was she like your wife?

38:43.947 --> 38:45.858
Did she expect a free ride?

38:49.787 --> 38:51.197
I-Vic?
-[V|c] Yeah?

38:51.413 --> 38:52.994
Call the bus company, uh,

38:53.207 --> 38:54.993
find out where that bus stopped,

38:55.209 --> 38:57.791
see if there's anywhere that,
uh, Delia could have gotten on.

38:58.003 --> 39:01.837
Bus 85678,
originated in Green Bay.

39:02.049 --> 39:03.585
Before it picked up them oilmen
in Oden,

39:03.801 --> 39:06.417
it passed through Minneapolis,
Sioux Falls, and Sturgis,

39:06.637 --> 39:08.502
whereupon some church people
got on board,

39:08.722 --> 39:11.759
coming on down here
to gamble for Jesus.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.887
Six of those oilmen said they
noticed a young brunette hottie.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.559
The churchies
said they noticed nothing,

39:16.772 --> 39:17.887
probably didn't want
to admit it.

39:18.106 --> 39:19.437
56 people on that bus.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.515
So far, I've talked to 54
of them at the casino.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.979
One of those two empty seats
could have been Delia Garrett.

39:24.196 --> 39:25.902
Bus did stop in Minneapolis.

39:26.657 --> 39:29.319
Lucian, show this picture
to those oilmen.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.821
Confirm that, uh,
she was on the bus with them.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.573
Got it.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.996
Ferg, get some clothes
for the bus driver.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.415
I got to take those girls
back to their RV.

39:38.627 --> 39:41.289
I want, uh, Randolph Hale ready

39:41.505 --> 39:43.086
for some more questions
when I get back.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.504
Got it.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.792
-Right.
-Okay. So --

39:49.012 --> 39:51.003
Vic. With me.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.348
Hold down the fort, Ringo.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.075
[Vic]
Who's that?

40:21.295 --> 40:22.751
[Logan]
That's Noah, Nikki's fiancé.

40:22.963 --> 40:24.669
He saw Delia on TV
and came right over.

40:24.882 --> 40:26.292
From Minnesota?

40:26.508 --> 40:28.419
-That was quick.
-He was already here.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.217
He was supposed to be the
big surprise for the bride.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.295
Sarah arranged for him
to meet us at the casino.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.380
She wanted everything
to be perfect for Nikki.

40:35.601 --> 40:36.932
Noah knew Delia?

40:37.144 --> 40:39.510
Yeah. We've all been friends
since college.

40:41.315 --> 40:42.555
Hmm.

40:48.989 --> 40:51.230
So, you want to talk about
what's been going on with you?

40:52.409 --> 40:53.615
Nope.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.236
Okay.

41:02.044 --> 41:03.750
Chelsea?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.122
You okay?

41:06.423 --> 41:08.584
I'll be fine, I guess.
Um...

41:15.682 --> 41:16.842
Wow.

41:17.059 --> 41:18.765
-These are something.
-[Che|sea] Yeah.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.059
Sarah had them made up for us.

41:21.271 --> 41:23.262
She thought of everything.

41:25.359 --> 41:27.645
Well, I was surprised to see
Noah here.

41:27.861 --> 41:29.977
In my day, the --
well, the groom

41:30.155 --> 41:32.066
didn't see the bride
before the wedding, so...

41:32.282 --> 41:33.783
Nobody follows
those dumb rules anymore.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.153
We all knew he was coming
except for Nikki.

41:36.370 --> 41:37.985
Yeah.

41:39.081 --> 41:41.072
You know, I, uh --

41:41.291 --> 41:43.156
Well, I don't get the impression
you're his biggest fan.

41:44.628 --> 41:46.994
I'm kind of Sherlock-y, so...

41:49.925 --> 41:51.756
He's fine.

41:54.137 --> 41:56.423
Is there something
you want to tell me?

42:02.187 --> 42:04.223
Uh...

42:04.439 --> 42:07.272
I never told anybody before
because I couldn't be sure,

42:07.484 --> 42:10.772
but I picked Delia up
one morning,

42:10.988 --> 42:12.899
and Noah's car was on her block.

42:13.782 --> 42:15.818
She lives in this shitty
nowhere part of town,

42:16.034 --> 42:18.241
so he wouldn't just randomly
be there.

42:19.246 --> 42:21.703
Now he's here, and she's here.

42:23.375 --> 42:25.161
I don't know.
Maybe she came to meet him.

42:25.377 --> 42:27.163
Maybe something went wrong.

42:27.379 --> 42:28.619
I don't know.

42:30.090 --> 42:32.376
[crying]

42:32.592 --> 42:35.834
I probably just watch
way too much "48 Hours."

42:40.934 --> 42:42.515
-What is it, Vic?
-Hey.

42:42.728 --> 42:45.060
So, um, Lucian

42:45.230 --> 42:47.266
showed the photo of Delia
to the oil workers,

42:47.482 --> 42:48.813
and they didn't recognize her.

42:49.026 --> 42:50.436
They were all talking about
someone else.

42:50.652 --> 42:52.563
Apparently, they all had a crush

42:52.779 --> 42:54.565
on a girl
from the church group, so...

42:55.949 --> 42:57.450
Okay.

42:57.659 --> 43:00.366
So, what do we do now?

43:01.371 --> 43:04.579
For starters, you could check
the luggage compartment for me.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.200
Okay.

43:33.987 --> 43:35.568
[sighs]

43:39.451 --> 43:41.407
What happened, Ursula?

43:47.417 --> 43:51.330
My husband got it in his head
I'd been talking about him.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.207
He went crazy.

43:54.591 --> 43:56.798
But I swear I hadn't.

43:58.595 --> 44:00.756
I am so sorry.

44:01.932 --> 44:03.342
It's funny.

44:03.558 --> 44:05.935
When Hector asked
if I knew about the Bear Helper,

44:06.144 --> 44:08.886
I thought he was talking about
the story.

44:09.106 --> 44:11.518
But he was talking about you.

44:11.733 --> 44:13.189
Who's the Bear Helper?

44:15.445 --> 44:17.151
Along time ago,

44:17.364 --> 44:20.606
a Cheyenne woman and her child
were fleeing from Crow warriors.

44:20.826 --> 44:24.819
It was winter,
so they were alone and scared.

44:25.038 --> 44:27.245
And she became more afraid
when --

44:27.457 --> 44:31.291
when she noticed a bear
was following her.

44:31.503 --> 44:34.620
But then the bear
said to the woman,

44:34.840 --> 44:37.877
"I am following you to cover
your tracks with mine

44:38.093 --> 44:40.550
so the Crow will not find you."

44:41.805 --> 44:44.888
When she and her child
got to a wide river,

44:45.100 --> 44:46.715
he carried them across
to safety.

44:52.315 --> 44:53.771
My tooth fell out!

45:04.119 --> 45:06.110
WiII Hector take his teeth?

45:08.498 --> 45:10.989
I never wanted him
to hurt my dad.

45:13.795 --> 45:16.377
What exactly did you
ask of Hector?

45:17.966 --> 45:18.955
To help my mom.

45:21.261 --> 45:23.252
Then that is exactly
what he will do.

45:30.187 --> 45:31.518
Right this way.

45:32.981 --> 45:35.438
I don't want to make
your weekend any worse.

45:36.610 --> 45:38.191
Ijust need to get
a few statements

45:38.403 --> 45:40.018
before you all head home.

45:42.908 --> 45:43.988
Thanks, Ferg.

45:44.201 --> 45:45.941
Right this way, please.

45:50.207 --> 45:52.744
Okay, so, I got some background
on Delia.

45:52.959 --> 45:54.995
Both of her parents died
when she was young,

45:55.212 --> 45:57.077
so she was pretty much
on her own.

45:57.297 --> 45:58.537
Uh, and she was hard up
for money.

45:58.757 --> 46:01.248
She only had $240
in her checking account.

46:01.468 --> 46:03.004
But I talked to her boss.

46:03.220 --> 46:04.926
He said she took four days off
to come on this trip,

46:05.138 --> 46:06.469
said she was excited, that, uh,

46:06.681 --> 46:08.933
this was her best friend's
wedding.

46:09.726 --> 46:13.560
Vic, you find anything
in the luggage compartment?

46:13.772 --> 46:15.137
Uh...

46:16.483 --> 46:18.394
Other than the smell
of vomit, no.

46:18.610 --> 46:20.020
What were you
expecting to find?

46:20.237 --> 46:21.727
More than that.

46:21.947 --> 46:24.063
Uh, run the fiancé's
credit cards -- Noah Minton.

46:24.282 --> 46:26.068
See if he was here all weekend.

46:26.284 --> 46:27.615
As soon as you get
the information,

46:27.827 --> 46:29.533
bring it in to me.

46:29.746 --> 46:31.862
Hey, Walt, if it would help,
I can work on the groom

46:32.082 --> 46:33.492
while you question the girls.

46:33.708 --> 46:35.744
Thanks, but no.

46:36.461 --> 46:39.328
Listen, Eamonn, I appreciate you
filling in while I was gone,

46:39.547 --> 46:42.004
but I won't be needing you
anymore.

46:42.217 --> 46:44.253
Let your boss know
I owe him a favor.

46:52.769 --> 46:55.636
Sarah, thanks
for coming down again.

46:55.855 --> 46:59.848
I thought, uh, Nikki may need
some emotional support.

47:00.068 --> 47:01.604
It's, uh -- It's quite a lot
to take in.

47:01.820 --> 47:03.481
-Yeah.
-No. Of course.

47:03.697 --> 47:08.066
I was hoping you could, uh,
give me some insight into Delia,

47:08.285 --> 47:10.367
who she was, what she was like.

47:11.162 --> 47:12.743
Who may have wanted to harm her.

47:16.126 --> 47:17.491
I understand that, uh,

47:17.711 --> 47:19.326
Nikki and Delia
were freshman roommates.

47:19.546 --> 47:21.878
So, Noah,
I assume you've known Delia

47:22.090 --> 47:23.921
as long as your fiancée.

47:24.801 --> 47:26.837
Yeah.
I guess I did.

47:27.846 --> 47:30.337
You had any recent contact
with Delia?

47:30.557 --> 47:33.264
Just the usual stuff, you know,
with the wedding and all.

47:33.476 --> 47:36.263
[Walt] Well, I heard that you
were the surprise of the trip.

47:36.479 --> 47:39.437
I guess your affair
was the surprise of the wedding.

47:41.901 --> 47:43.482
-[sobs]
-What?

47:43.695 --> 47:45.936
Did you arrange for Delia
to come down here and see you

47:46.156 --> 47:48.772
because you knew your fiancée
was on the road?

47:48.992 --> 47:50.232
Oh, my God.

47:50.452 --> 47:52.238
Maybe Delia
threatened to tell Nikki,

47:52.454 --> 47:54.160
and that's why you killed her.

47:54.372 --> 47:56.909
[scoffs] No, I don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

47:57.125 --> 47:58.456
Well, you knew enough
to dump the body

47:58.668 --> 48:00.204
where you wouldn't be suspected.

48:00.420 --> 48:02.832
And you had access
to the girls' itinerary, right?

48:03.548 --> 48:05.834
Yeah, he did.
I gave it to him.

48:06.051 --> 48:07.040
What did you do, Noah?

48:07.260 --> 48:08.466
These girls never saw the bag

48:08.678 --> 48:10.088
that Delia was stuffed into,

48:10.305 --> 48:12.466
but you saw it,
because you bought it.

48:12.682 --> 48:14.218
No.
This is insane.

48:14.434 --> 48:15.924
I don't know what
you're talking about.

48:16.144 --> 48:18.510
My deputy just ran
your credit cards.

48:18.730 --> 48:21.267
You had a recent purchase
from a nearby Walmart

48:21.483 --> 48:23.314
hours before the body was found.

48:23.526 --> 48:24.777
What? No.

48:24.986 --> 48:27.102
Hey, baby, say something.

48:27.322 --> 48:29.153
Tell him there is no way
I could ever kill Delia.

48:29.366 --> 48:30.481
Stop it.
You're hurting her.

48:30.700 --> 48:31.655
You stay out of it.

48:31.868 --> 48:33.074
This trip, this entire wedding

48:33.286 --> 48:35.197
has been nothing
but the two of you.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.790
Did they shut you out, Noah?

48:37.999 --> 48:39.500
Is that why you turned to Delia?

48:40.627 --> 48:42.709
Delia think this was more
than a one-time deal?

48:42.921 --> 48:45.378
-It was more than one time.
-[Noah] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.672
I didn't do this. I don't know
why you're trying to blame me!

48:47.884 --> 48:49.340
Grow up, Noah,
and take responsibility.

48:49.552 --> 48:53.170
-Shut up!
-[sobbing]

48:57.227 --> 48:59.718
Vic, could you take Noah
outside, please,

48:59.938 --> 49:01.803
and see that he doesn't leave?

49:08.488 --> 49:10.524
This was supposed to be perfect.

49:10.740 --> 49:12.605
[Sarah] I'm sorry.
He didn't deserve you anyway.

49:12.826 --> 49:14.236
Can we go now, please?

49:14.452 --> 49:16.067
-Sure.
-Thank you.

49:16.287 --> 49:19.575
So, Sarah, you said that, uh,

49:19.791 --> 49:21.782
Delia canceled
at the last minute,

49:22.001 --> 49:25.539
so why didn't you have any gifts
made up for her?

49:25.755 --> 49:28.918
Champagne flutes or T-shirts?

49:29.843 --> 49:32.380
Well, unless you knew she
wasn't coming all along.

49:33.638 --> 49:35.469
Why are you asking us this?

49:35.640 --> 49:38.222
You just said Noah did it.
He bought the bag at Walmart.

49:38.435 --> 49:39.515
[Walt]
Oh, I'm sorry.

49:39.727 --> 49:41.513
I thought we were all lying.

49:41.729 --> 49:44.721
Isn't that the game
we're playing here?

49:44.941 --> 49:48.024
I lied
about the credit-card charge.

49:48.236 --> 49:50.022
No Walmart.
[clears throat]

49:50.238 --> 49:51.853
Noah lied about the affair.

49:52.073 --> 49:55.315
And you, well,
you lied about who killed Delia.

49:56.661 --> 49:57.650
It was you.

49:58.621 --> 49:59.906
You already admitted

50:00.123 --> 50:01.829
that you knew
about Delia and Noah,

50:02.041 --> 50:03.247
so you had motive.

50:03.460 --> 50:04.916
They betrayed
your best friend here,

50:05.128 --> 50:07.084
and if you didn't order
a gift basket for Delia

50:07.297 --> 50:09.834
because you knew that she
wasn't coming on your trip,

50:10.049 --> 50:13.507
well, that gives you
intent and premeditation.

50:15.430 --> 50:17.295
The only thing -- The only thing
that was premeditated

50:17.515 --> 50:18.971
was talking to Delia.

50:19.184 --> 50:20.845
We just wanted to get her
to admit anything,

50:21.060 --> 50:22.516
so when Nikki and I showed up
in the RV

50:22.729 --> 50:24.845
and she just got on
like nothing was wrong,

50:25.064 --> 50:26.315
like she could be screwing Noah

50:26.524 --> 50:28.185
and she could still be
our friend.

50:28.401 --> 50:30.312
We didn't mean for any of this
to happen. I promise.

50:30.528 --> 50:33.065
She tried to leave, so I grabbed
her, and she started pushing me.

50:33.281 --> 50:35.613
Nikki pushed her off, and l-l-I
have no idea how it happened,

50:35.825 --> 50:37.611
but she hit her head
and she landed on the floor

50:37.827 --> 50:39.863
and she wasn't moving
and she was bleeding so much.

50:40.079 --> 50:41.489
So, we drove and we got a bag.

50:41.706 --> 50:43.947
And she would even admit
anything!

50:44.167 --> 50:47.751
And after you got hit
by the casino bus,

50:47.962 --> 50:52.752
the two of you, you took
advantage of all that chaos,

50:52.967 --> 50:55.504
took somebody else's
luggage tag,

50:55.720 --> 50:59.588
put it on your new bag,

50:59.807 --> 51:01.343
and dumped the body.

51:03.311 --> 51:06.394
[Nikki]
Sarah, how did this happen?

51:08.525 --> 51:10.857
I did everything right.

51:26.084 --> 51:27.699
What I don't understand is

51:27.919 --> 51:29.534
why they didn't just call off
the wedding.

51:30.588 --> 51:32.965
Some people just don't know
how to end things.

51:35.885 --> 51:39.503
I just want to say goodbye
and thank you. I enjoyed it.

51:39.722 --> 51:41.428
Good luck to you.

51:47.313 --> 51:49.395
Let me walk you out.

51:51.442 --> 51:54.104
Walt, Mathias is on the phone.

51:54.320 --> 51:56.857
He needs to talk to you.

52:02.078 --> 52:05.411
I am so sorry. I don't know
what the problem is.

52:05.623 --> 52:07.124
You're a really good cop.

52:07.333 --> 52:08.584
Oh, I know.

52:08.793 --> 52:11.125
Walt's just jealous... of you
and me.

52:12.755 --> 52:14.370
Let's look at the bright side.

52:15.925 --> 52:18.132
I'm only one county away,
and, uh,

52:18.344 --> 52:20.460
well, now I got your number
and you got mine.

52:22.223 --> 52:23.838
Uh,yeah.
Yeah.

52:24.058 --> 52:28.051
We, uh, certainly
have each other's number.

52:34.068 --> 52:37.560
[vehicle door closes,
engine turns over]

52:53.338 --> 52:54.919
[Mathias]
Hey, Standing Bear,

52:55.131 --> 52:56.712
Merwin Tall Grass filed a report

52:56.924 --> 52:58.915
that his wife and child
are missing.

52:59.135 --> 53:00.671
How can I help?

53:00.887 --> 53:03.128
You can tell me where they are.

53:03.348 --> 53:05.134
And why would I know that?

53:05.350 --> 53:06.840
Tall Grass reported that you

53:07.060 --> 53:08.721
were paying a little too
much attention to his wife

53:08.936 --> 53:10.312
at the casino opening.

53:13.733 --> 53:16.349
I was paying attention
to the bruises he gave her.

53:16.569 --> 53:17.979
I hope for her sake
she and her son

53:18.196 --> 53:19.936
are very far away.

53:20.156 --> 53:23.444
A neighbor reported seeing you
drop the boy off near his house

53:23.660 --> 53:26.447
a day before his mother and him
disappeared.

53:26.663 --> 53:28.153
We need to search
your apartment.

53:28.373 --> 53:32.833
I have no authority off the Res,
but Walt does.

53:33.044 --> 53:34.375
Come on, Henry.

53:34.587 --> 53:35.872
Just let us take
a quick look inside,

53:36.089 --> 53:37.329
and we'll leave you alone.

53:38.341 --> 53:40.957
I told you, they are not here.
You should trust me.

53:41.177 --> 53:42.587
I do.

53:42.804 --> 53:43.759
Then why are you still insisting

53:43.971 --> 53:45.177
on going up to my apartment?

53:47.016 --> 53:49.803
'Cause right now, a whole lot
of people don't trust me.

54:47.827 --> 54:49.317
[door closes]

55:03.634 --> 55:05.761
[mid-tempo music playing]

55:18.941 --> 55:20.101
Buy you another?

55:24.238 --> 55:25.227
Jess.

55:34.582 --> 55:35.913
Thanks.

55:45.635 --> 55:50.675
I wanted to thank you
for your help on this case.

55:52.391 --> 55:54.928
Work keeps me
on the right side of the grass.

55:55.895 --> 55:58.762
Sorry to hear about
them pretty girls going to jail.

55:59.732 --> 56:01.563
News travels.

56:07.073 --> 56:09.234
I haven't said it, but...

56:11.285 --> 56:13.150
...|'m sorry about Barlow.

56:17.500 --> 56:19.240
After you shot Barlow,

56:19.460 --> 56:21.792
I cogitated on all the ways

56:22.004 --> 56:23.960
I could have been
a better brother.

56:25.007 --> 56:30.343
Maybe if I'd done more,
spent more time with him,

56:30.555 --> 56:33.137
Branch would be alive,

56:33.349 --> 56:36.762
Martha would be alive.

56:41.607 --> 56:42.767
You believe that?

56:48.322 --> 56:49.903
I'll tell you what I believe.

56:51.492 --> 56:53.574
My brother would have been
a good man

56:53.786 --> 56:56.368
if somebody had been there
to shoot him

56:56.581 --> 56:58.617
every minute of his life.
