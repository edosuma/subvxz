WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:03.068
- I FEEL GREAT,
AND THE PILLS ARE UNDER CONTROL.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.330
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.

00:04.450 --> 00:05.269
- IS IT TRUE THAT YOU VIOLENTLY

00:05.380 --> 00:07.109
ASSAULTED A MAN
IN A SUPERMARKET?

00:07.210 --> 00:08.962
- BOB LITI'LE HAS FOUND
A WAY TO GO NEGATIVE.

00:09.070 --> 00:10.446
WE'RE DOWN TO THE WIRE.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.516
HE CAN TURN THIS TWO-POINT LEAD
TO A FIVE-POINT LEAD.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.245
- DROPPED FOUR POINTS.

00:14.350 --> 00:16.693
- WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT HE
MOVE BACK TO THE FOURTH GRADE

00:16.800 --> 00:18.210
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.016
- I'M SORRY, JULIA.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.224
- NO ONE ASKED YOU
TO GO QUIT YOUR JOB.

00:23.330 --> 00:24.843
JUST LIKE YOU WENT
AND TALKED TO MISS MCKINDALL.

00:24.950 --> 00:26.178
- THIS ISN'T FAIR.

00:26.300 --> 00:26.982
THEN I'LL BE
IN THE SAME GRADE AS SYDNEY?

00:27.090 --> 00:29.126
AND WHAT ABOUT ALL MY FRIENDS?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.504
- YOU CAN DO THIS.

00:30.610 --> 00:32.293
YOU'RE A BRAVE BOY.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.265
[school bell rings]
ALL RIGHT.

00:37.380 --> 00:39.200
- HEY, VICTOR.
- WHAT'S UP?

00:39.310 --> 00:40.470
- WHAT'S UP, VICTOR?

00:40.590 --> 00:43.582
- DUDE, I HEARD HE FLUNKED.
[both laugh]

00:43.690 --> 00:45.339
- AH, LOOK THERE.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.623
- YOU CAN DO THIS, BUDDY.

00:50.740 --> 00:52.389
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A SECOND.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.148
COME ON.

00:53.260 --> 00:55.706
LET'S GO TO THE BATHROOM.

01:01.780 --> 01:02.986
- HEY, JULIA, WHAT'S UP?

01:03.090 --> 01:04.569
- HEY.
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:04.680 --> 01:06.056
- OH, YOU KNOW...

01:06.160 --> 01:07.502
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.259
- UM...

01:09.370 --> 01:14.342
TODAY'S THE DAY THAT VICTOR'S
CHANGING CLASSROOMS.

01:14.450 --> 01:15.235
- I'M SORRY.
- IT'S OKAY.

01:15.350 --> 01:17.409
- HE'S GOING DOWN TO FOURTH.

01:17.520 --> 01:18.794
- YEAH.
- I DIDN'T MEAN DOWN TO--

01:18.900 --> 01:20.106
- OVER TO--
YEAH, WHATEVER,

01:20.210 --> 01:21.108
INTO FOURTH.

01:21.210 --> 01:22.586
- I'M SORRY.

01:23.460 --> 01:27.282
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S HARD, BUT...

01:27.390 --> 01:28.493
IT'S THE BEST THING FOR HIM.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.977
YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT TO BE
WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE.

01:31.090 --> 01:31.840
- YEAH.

01:31.950 --> 01:32.393
- IN THE LONG RUN, YOU KNOW.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.082
- YEAH.
- I'M SORRY.

01:36.570 --> 01:38.811
OH, HEY.
- OH, YOU REMEMBER ED?

01:38.920 --> 01:39.397
- ED, YEAH, HEY.

01:39.510 --> 01:43.094
- HI, JOEL.
- UH...

01:43.200 --> 01:45.020
WE GOT TO GET
THIS GUY TO CLASS.

01:45.130 --> 01:46.757
- YEAH, SORRY.

01:49.970 --> 01:51.517
- OKAY.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.275
- YOU'RE IN MY SEAT.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.656
- NO, I'M NOT.
- YES, ACTUALLY, YOU ARE.

02:29.770 --> 02:31.271
- THIS IS MY CHAIR,

02:31.390 --> 02:33.381
THIS IS MY DESK,
AND, LIKE, ALL MY STUFF.

02:33.490 --> 02:36.072
MY DAD OWNS THIS WHOLE PLACE.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.669
- YOUR DAD IS HANK?

02:37.770 --> 02:40.113
- YES, MY DAD IS HANK.

02:40.220 --> 02:41.221
WHICH MEANS ALL
THIS STUFF IS MINE.

02:41.330 --> 02:42.422
- IT DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER.

02:42.540 --> 02:45.941
YOU'RE STILL IN MY SEAT,
AND I'M SWAMPED.

02:46.060 --> 02:48.779
- WHATEVER.

02:48.890 --> 02:50.471
- AND YOU MOVED MY CHAIR.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.923
- SO WHAT ARE YOU,
SLAVE LABOR OR SOMETHING?

02:58.030 --> 03:00.237
- NO, SLAVES ARE ILLEGAL.

03:00.350 --> 03:03.069
- WHAT ARE YOU THEN?

03:03.180 --> 03:04.511
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TALK RIGHT NOW.

03:04.630 --> 03:07.383
I STILL HAVE TWO ROLLS
OF FILM TO DEVELOP,

03:07.490 --> 03:09.355
AND THE 57 BUS WAS LATE,

03:09.460 --> 03:11.314
POSSIBLY DUE TO TRAFFIC
ON COLLEGE AVENUE.

03:11.430 --> 03:13.011
SOMETIMES THE TRAFFIC
GETS BLOCKED UP,

03:13.120 --> 03:14.212
AND IT AFFECTS THE BUS SCHEDULE.

03:14.330 --> 03:17.299
BUS SCHEDULES ARE NOT PRECISE.
FAR FROM IT.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.469
SO NOW
I'M TEN MINUTES LATE,

03:18.570 --> 03:20.435
AND YOU JUST WASTED
ANOTHER FIVE.

03:20.540 --> 03:23.020
- HEY, YOU GUYS MET, HUH?

03:23.130 --> 03:25.291
RUBY, THAT'S MAX.
- MM-HMM.

03:25.410 --> 03:26.479
- SHE REARRANGED
THE STUFF ON MY DESK.

03:26.580 --> 03:28.502
- HE'S LEARNING PHOTOGRAPHY.
HE'S PRETTY GOOD.

03:28.620 --> 03:32.021
- WELL, I'M GOING OUT
FOR A DOUGHNUT, OKAY?

03:32.140 --> 03:33.300
- WHAT? NO, NO, HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

03:33.420 --> 03:34.444
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO GET DOUGHNUTS,

03:34.550 --> 03:36.791
THEN YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY FIND OUT

03:36.900 --> 03:39.619
IF ANY OF US WANTS
SOME DOUGHNUTS, HMM?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.831
- YOU WANT A DOUGHNUT?
- SURE.

03:44.940 --> 03:45.349
- GREAT.

03:45.460 --> 03:48.213
BYE.
- BYE.

03:48.330 --> 03:52.323
COUPLE JELLY.
- JELLY'S GROSS.

03:52.430 --> 03:54.250
- SO YOU MET RUBY, HUH?

03:54.370 --> 03:57.157
SHE TAKES A LITTLE WHILE
TO WARM UP, BUT...

03:57.270 --> 03:57.599
- HOW OLD IS SHE?

03:57.720 --> 04:00.097
- 14.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.237
- 14. PERFECT.

04:04.550 --> 04:06.825
- LET'S GO, ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE LATE.

04:06.930 --> 04:08.090
WE GOT TO GET THIS DONE.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

04:08.210 --> 04:09.859
I WAS TEN MINUTES LATE
BECAUSE THE BUS

04:09.970 --> 04:11.312
ON 57 WAS DELAYED DUE TO--
- YEAH, I HEARD, I HEARD.

04:11.420 --> 04:13.763
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:13.870 --> 04:14.768

04:21.190 --> 04:23.875
- SHE'S GONNA BE THE NEXT MAYOR.
TELL YOUR PARENTS--

04:23.980 --> 04:26.494
- CUTE! HI!

04:26.610 --> 04:29.465

04:29.570 --> 04:32.676
ALL RIGHTY.

04:32.780 --> 04:35.476
YOU GOT 100%
ORGANIC GROUND CHUCK.

04:35.580 --> 04:38.959
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE WITH THAT?

04:39.070 --> 04:40.332
- OKAY, TAKE A PICTURE.

04:40.450 --> 04:42.270
- THANK YOU.
THAT WAS FUN.

04:42.380 --> 04:43.608
[kids yelling]

04:43.730 --> 04:45.755

04:53.320 --> 04:54.764
I WANT TO FIGHT FOR YOU.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.872

04:57.980 --> 04:59.800

05:04.200 --> 05:05.462

05:06.650 --> 05:07.742

THE PARENTS' FACES?

05:07.850 --> 05:08.600
THEY WERE LIKE--

05:27.180 --> 05:27.669
- WE COULD DO THIS.

05:27.770 --> 05:29.567
I COULD WIN.

05:29.670 --> 05:30.898

I DON'T THINK I COULD GIVE AWAY
A $5 BILL.

06:41.020 --> 06:43.250
- WELL, THIS IS GREAT.
I'M LOVING THIS.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.224

06:44.330 --> 06:45.638
- HERE YOU GO,

06:45.750 --> 06:46.910
- I DON'T WANT TO INSTIGATE,

06:47.020 --> 06:48.703
BUT YOU'RE NOT OFFENDED BY THIS,
ARE YOU?

06:48.820 --> 06:49.809
- NO, WHY?

06:49.920 --> 06:51.501
- WELL, THE FACT
THAT KRISTINA AND HEATHER

06:51.610 --> 06:52.747
SENT US HERE, YOU KNOW.

06:52.860 --> 06:54.612
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONLY
BLACK PERSON THEY KNOW,

06:55.620 --> 06:56.689
I JUST THINK--
- NO, WHY--

06:56.790 --> 06:58.929
- WELL,
I'M KIND OF OFFENDED FOR YOU.

06:59.030 --> 07:00.372
- DON'T BE.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.856
- I MEAN, AND I'M
AN HONORARY BLACK PERSON,

07:01.970 --> 07:02.720
SO I'M A LITTLE OFFENDED.
- HONEY, YOU ARE VERY,

07:02.830 --> 07:05.583
VERY WHITE.
- WHOA, ON THE SPECTRUM,

07:05.700 --> 07:07.656
RIGHT, OF BLACK AND WHITE,
ADAM'S HERE.

07:07.770 --> 07:09.692
FARRAKHAN'S HERE.
- AND WHERE ARE YOU?

07:09.800 --> 07:11.176
- I'M RIGHT HERE.
I'M LIKE 3/4 OF THE WAY TO--

07:11.290 --> 07:14.009
- WELL, I GUESS IF YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY, ON THAT SPECTRUM,

07:14.120 --> 07:15.940
AS OPPOSED TO YOUR BROTHER,
YOU ARE NOT AS WHITE AS HIM.

07:16.050 --> 07:17.529
- AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT
OFFENDED...

07:17.640 --> 07:18.982
- BUT YOU'RE STILL VERY WHITE.
- THEN I'M...

07:19.090 --> 07:22.218
- NO, BABY, I'M REALLY NOT.
I'M REALLY INTO THIS.

07:22.330 --> 07:23.649
YOU KNOW,
ELECTIONS AND VOTING,

07:23.750 --> 07:24.739
IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME.

07:24.850 --> 07:27.819
I MEAN, CASTING MY BALLOT
FOR OBAMA IN '08

07:27.930 --> 07:29.886
WAS ONE OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL
THINGS I'VE EVER DONE.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.786
YOU KNOW, LIKE, THINKING
ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME,

07:31.890 --> 07:35.656
AND THAT I HELPED TO ELECT
THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.819
I MEAN, I NEVER THOUGHT THAT
WOULD HAPPEN IN MY LIFETIME.

07:37.940 --> 07:39.555
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU CAN'T
REALLY RELATE TO THAT,

07:39.660 --> 07:41.002
BUT--
- YEAH, I CAN.

07:41.110 --> 07:42.384
- REALLY?
- TOTALLY.

07:42.490 --> 07:43.900
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS
A BLACK-WHITE THING.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.069
I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY
A PROFOUND MOMENT.

07:46.180 --> 07:46.999
I GOT--
- IT WAS.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.111
- YEAH, WHEN I VOTED,
I GOT EMOTIONAL.

07:49.220 --> 07:50.460

07:50.570 --> 07:52.185
- YEAH, I CRIED--YEAH.
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, AW.

07:52.290 --> 07:53.496

07:53.610 --> 07:54.986
- REMEMBER WHEN YOU GOT
YOUR LITTLE STICKER?

07:55.090 --> 07:56.466
- YEAH,
I STILL HAVE IT SOMEPLACE.

07:56.570 --> 07:57.150
- YOU DO?
- YEAH, I THINK SO.

07:57.260 --> 07:59.296
- SO DO I.
- YEAH?

07:59.400 --> 08:00.879
AW.

08:00.990 --> 08:03.993
- YOU'RE THE BEST.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.237
I LOVE YOU.

08:05.340 --> 08:07.683
- OKAY, SO THE AREA
THAT YOU WANT TO BRING OUT MORE,

08:07.790 --> 08:10.998
YOU LET THE LIGHT ON THROUGH
THE HOLE JUST A LITTLE MORE.

08:11.110 --> 08:12.031
YOU JUST GO OVER IT.

08:12.140 --> 08:14.199
SO WE WANT THAT FENCE
TO COME OUT.

SO WE JUST GO UP.
HERE, YOU TRY IT.

08:15.970 --> 08:18.347
WE JUST WANT THAT LIGHT

RUBY TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.846
- WHAT?

08:30.850 --> 08:31.703
- AS THE FATHER,
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

08:31.820 --> 08:37.053
- I MEAN--
HO, HO, NO, MAX, UH...

08:37.170 --> 08:38.956
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

08:39.070 --> 08:42.164
- WHY NOT?
- 'CAUSE SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.998
- I KNOW.
THAT'S HOW WE MET.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.967
- WHY DO YOU EVEN WANT HER
AS A GIRLFRIEND ANYWAY?

08:47.070 --> 08:48.753
- SHE WAS WEARING
A SHARKS SHIRT.

08:48.870 --> 08:50.792
- YEAH.
- I'M A SHARKS FAN.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.243
THAT MEANS WE HAVE
COMMON INTERESTS.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.759
ALSO, WE'RE BOTH 14,
AND I'M A BOY, AND SHE'S A GIRL,

08:54.870 --> 08:58.704
WHICH MEANS SHE MEETS
ALL THE REQUIREMENTS.

08:58.810 --> 08:59.708
- YOU KNOW, MAX, COME ON.

08:59.810 --> 09:01.698
FIRST OF ALL,
SHE LIVES IN MINNESOTA.

09:01.810 --> 09:04.677
SHE'S MOODY.
YOU SAW WHAT SHE'S LIKE, RIGHT?

09:04.780 --> 09:07.010
- I'M ASKING HER TOMORROW.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.300
- HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?

09:18.410 --> 09:19.513
- WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

09:19.620 --> 09:20.860
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE PROFILING

09:20.970 --> 09:22.653
A SERIAL KILLER OR SOMETHING.
- [laughs]

09:22.760 --> 09:24.102
- HAVE YOU TAKEN A JOB
WITH THE FBI?

09:24.210 --> 09:26.269
- MAYBE, BY ACCIDENT,
I DON'T KNOW.

09:26.390 --> 09:28.665
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM IS THIS?

09:28.770 --> 09:30.624
I'M SO CONFUSED.
- OH, THIS IS YOUR UNCLE ADAM.

09:30.740 --> 09:32.002
HE LOVES ANYTHING ANTIQUATED.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.634
PAPER, STEAM ENGINES.
- I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO--

09:34.740 --> 09:36.321
- IF HE COULD RIDE A HORSE
TO WORK, HE WOULD.

09:36.430 --> 09:38.318
- IT'S REALLY BAD.
WE SHOULD TRY TO MOVE PAST THIS.

09:38.430 --> 09:39.499
- WELL, YOU'RE BUSY.

09:39.610 --> 09:41.293
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
TO HELP ME DOWNSTAIRS

09:41.400 --> 09:43.220
WITH SOMETHING CREATIVE
AND ARTISTIC AND MUSICAL,

09:43.340 --> 09:44.955
BUT THAT WOULDN'T INTEREST YOU.
- WHAT?

09:45.060 --> 09:46.857
- THE CASE SEEMS TO BE...
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:46.960 --> 09:48.689
- HOT RIGHT NOW,
SO I HOPE YOU FIND YOUR MAN.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.587
- [laughing] CROSBY!
WAIT!

09:50.690 --> 09:51.964
- HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

09:52.070 --> 09:54.618
TOMORROW WE HAVE BACK-UP
VOCALISTS COMING IN TO RECORD.

09:54.730 --> 09:55.685
- OKAY, SO?

09:55.800 --> 09:56.869
- WE NEED A SCRATCH TRACK,

09:56.970 --> 09:58.312
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.
- WHAT?

09:58.420 --> 09:59.512
- YOU ARE GOING TO SING
SAID SCRATCH TRACK.

09:59.630 --> 10:00.699
- NO, CROSBY,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.937
- YES, YOU ARE.
- NO, 'CAUSE I'M NOT READY.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.553
- OPPORTUNITIES DO NOT COME
EVERY DAY, SO PLEASE.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.762
- FOR WHAT, FOR TAKING YOU HOME?

10:04.880 --> 10:05.949
I DON'T HAVE--I'M NOT--
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:06.050 --> 10:07.733
- HEY, YOU KNOW THE SONG OR NOT?

10:07.840 --> 10:08.943
YES, YOU DO.
- I KNOW IT, BUT I'M NOT READY.

10:09.050 --> 10:11.735
I HAVE TO GET MY VOICE
WARMED UP AND STUFF.

10:11.850 --> 10:13.568
YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN HERE FOR THIS?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.250
REALLY?

10:15.370 --> 10:17.258
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.

10:17.370 --> 10:19.747
[music begins]

10:19.860 --> 10:22.021
- [clears throat]

10:22.130 --> 10:26.897
WOULDN'T I LOVE
TO HOLD YOU AGAIN

10:27.000 --> 10:31.824
WE WERE SO MESSED UP
AND BUSY

10:31.940 --> 10:35.762
WITH KEEPING IT
IN YOUR EYES

10:35.870 --> 10:38.668
WE'RE STANDING FOR SOMETHING

10:38.770 --> 10:40.635
THAT I COULDN'T SEE

10:40.740 --> 10:43.777
BUT I KNEW
IT WAS COMING

10:43.880 --> 10:49.944
WE'RE JUST ONE CRUSH AWAY

10:50.060 --> 10:52.051
I STILL WANT YOU MORE

10:56.170 --> 11:01.619
WE COULD LAY HERE ALL DAY

11:01.730 --> 11:04.198
I'D STILL WANT YOU MORE

11:04.310 --> 11:06.517
- MORE, MORE

11:06.630 --> 11:11.829
- I SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN YOU HOME

11:11.940 --> 11:17.708
I SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN YOU HOME

11:17.810 --> 11:21.701
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
YOU HOME

11:21.810 --> 11:24.631
TAKEN YOU HOME

11:24.750 --> 11:27.332
TAKEN
YOU HOME

11:27.440 --> 11:30.125
TAKEN YOU HOME

11:30.240 --> 11:32.026
HI.
- HEY.

11:32.130 --> 11:32.789
- SORRY IT'S KIND OF LATE.

11:32.890 --> 11:35.893
- YEP.
- HEY, BUD.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.345
OH, MY GOSH,
IT'S SUCH A GOOD DAY.

11:39.450 --> 11:39.962
HOW'S IT GOING?

11:40.070 --> 11:42.937
- GOOD.
- GOOD. GREAT.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.974
- I GOT DINNER FOR US
BUT I...

11:45.080 --> 11:47.548
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.
- I ALREADY ATE IT.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.001
YOU CAN HEAT IT UP.
- THAT'S OKAY.

11:49.120 --> 11:49.905
I'M ACTUALLY NOT
THAT HUNGRY ANYWAY.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.183
GOD,
I HAD SUCH A GOOD DAY.

11:52.290 --> 11:54.804
I RECORDED A GUIDE VOCAL TRACK
TODAY WITH THE BAND.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.320
- COOL.
- YEAH, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

11:57.440 --> 11:58.361
- THAT SOUNDS COOL.

11:58.470 --> 11:59.539
- AND I WAS REALLY NERVOUS,

11:59.640 --> 12:00.709
BECAUSE, I WAS, LIKE,

12:00.820 --> 12:02.742
HAVING TO SING
IN FRONT OF THOSE BOYS,

12:02.860 --> 12:05.055
BUT IT ACTUALLY WENT REALLY,
REALLY WELL.

12:05.170 --> 12:05.920
- OF COURSE.

12:06.030 --> 12:07.236
- SO, I DON'T KNOW, IT WAS GOOD.

12:07.340 --> 12:08.989
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.751
SO HOW ABOUT YOU?
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

12:11.860 --> 12:14.135
- IT WAS GOOD,
I GOT HOME EARLY SO

12:14.250 --> 12:16.275
I ORDERED YOUR FAVORITE,
YOU KNOW,

12:16.390 --> 12:19.382
AND I JUST, I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE
A ROMANTIC DINNER,

12:19.490 --> 12:23.381
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING
TO BE GETTING HOME SO LATE.

12:25.950 --> 12:28.532
- ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

12:28.640 --> 12:29.846
- NO, I'M JUST BUMMED.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.679
YOU KNOW, I GOT ALL THAT
FOOD AND EVERYTHING.

12:31.780 --> 12:35.022
- NO, NOT ABOUT THAT.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.951
I FEEL LIKE EVER SINCE
WE DEALT WITH THE RING...

12:38.060 --> 12:39.334
- [laughs] NO!
- I DON'T KNOW,

12:39.440 --> 12:40.919
LIKE A LITTLE DISTANT OR--
- NO, THERE'S NOTHING

12:41.030 --> 12:42.406
ABOUT THE RING.
WE'VE ALREADY DEALT WITH THAT.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.408
IT'S FINE NOW, IT'S--
- I KNOW, BUT I JUST--

12:44.520 --> 12:44.997
IT FEELS LIKE YOU TOOK
IT REALLY PERSONALLY,

12:45.100 --> 12:46.920
LIKE I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.962
- NO, IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH
TALKING ABOUT.

12:49.070 --> 12:51.550
I'M HAPPY. IT'S GREAT.
I JUST MISSED YOU, THAT'S ALL.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.343
I JUST MISS YOU.

12:53.460 --> 12:54.142
- OKAY.

12:54.250 --> 12:55.933
- I'M NOT MAD.
- OKAY, OKAY.

12:56.050 --> 12:58.143
- I PROMISE.
- OKAY.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.046
- I PROMISE.

13:00.150 --> 13:02.015
- OKAY.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.771
- I JUST REALLY MISSED YOU,
YOU KNOW.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.290
- I MISSED YOU TOO.
- MM-HMM.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.743
- HEY.
- WHAT?

13:08.850 --> 13:09.953
THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING

13:10.060 --> 13:12.540
I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT REAL FAST.

13:12.650 --> 13:13.548
- WHAT?
- WAIT, WAIT.

13:13.650 --> 13:14.571
- WHAT?

13:19.660 --> 13:23.175
- ARE YOU TAKING
THOSE PILLS AGAIN?

13:23.280 --> 13:25.339
- WHAT?

13:25.450 --> 13:26.519
- I WAS DOING LAUNDRY,

13:26.630 --> 13:29.667
AND I WAS PUTTING
SOME OF YOUR STUFF AWAY, BABE,

13:29.770 --> 13:31.556
AND I SAW
THAT THEY WERE IN THERE,

13:31.670 --> 13:32.739
AND I JUST--

13:32.840 --> 13:34.046
- NO.

13:34.150 --> 13:37.187
THAT'S A--I MEAN,
THAT'S AN OLD PRESCRIPTION.

13:37.290 --> 13:41.124
- WELL, IT'S FROM TWO WEEKS AGO.

13:41.230 --> 13:44.085
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I-I-I HAVEN'T--

13:44.200 --> 13:45.952
THEY HAVEN'T STOPPED IT,
BUT I--

13:46.060 --> 13:48.472
IT'S AN OLD PRESCRIPTION
FROM BEFORE.

13:48.580 --> 13:49.615
I DON'T EVEN NEED IT.

13:49.720 --> 13:50.880
THOSE ARE ANXIETY
PILLS THAT ARE--

13:51.000 --> 13:53.924
- BABE, I--IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME
IF YOU TAKE THEM,

13:54.040 --> 13:55.132
I JUST--
- I'M NOT TAKING THEM.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.719
- OKAY, OKAY.
- I DON'T EVEN NEED THEM.

13:56.830 --> 13:59.276
- I JUST WANTED--IT FELT LIKE
YOU WERE HIDING IT FROM ME,

13:59.390 --> 14:00.345
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.599
- NO, NO, I'M NOT HIDING
ANYTHING FROM YOU.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.385
I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE
NERVOUS OR FREAK OUT ABOUT IT.

14:05.490 --> 14:06.422
- OKAY.

14:10.530 --> 14:12.111
- I LOVE YOU.

14:14.750 --> 14:18.334
- ONE LAST TRY

14:18.440 --> 14:19.122
[cell phone chimes]

14:31.180 --> 14:33.489
- I HOPE HE CAN SLEEP.

14:33.590 --> 14:35.273
- YEAH, HOW WAS HE?

14:35.390 --> 14:37.938
- STOIC.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.075
- YOU GOT A TEXT FROM ED BROOKS.

14:39.180 --> 14:42.422
- OH.

14:42.530 --> 14:45.875
- YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN TEXTING
EACH OTHER A LOT LATELY.

14:45.980 --> 14:47.777
- YEAH,
SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE

14:47.880 --> 14:51.088
IS TAKING OVER MY LIFE.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.748
DO YOU WANT SOME TEA?

14:53.850 --> 14:56.739
- NOPE.

14:56.860 --> 14:58.646
I'M GOOD.

15:04.660 --> 15:06.139
- DO YOU HAVE TO VOTE?

15:06.250 --> 15:08.002
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO,
BUT YOU SHOULD.

15:08.110 --> 15:10.908
YOU KNOW,
IT'S YOUR CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY,

15:11.010 --> 15:12.454
LIVING IN A DEMOCRACY,
WHICH WE LIVE IN,

15:12.560 --> 15:14.175
WHICH IS
THE GREATEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT,

15:14.290 --> 15:15.939
'CAUSE YOU CAN TELL THEM
WHAT YOUR OPINION IS.

15:16.050 --> 15:18.564
LET'S GO AHEAD,
AND MAKE YOUR AUNT

15:18.670 --> 15:19.876
THE MAYOR OF THIS FINE CITY.

15:19.980 --> 15:22.323
- YEAH.
- HELLO THERE, EDIE.

15:22.430 --> 15:23.419
- GOOD MORNING.

15:23.540 --> 15:24.052

15:24.160 --> 15:26.572
- LOOKS PRETTY STRONG TO ME.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.817

15:27.920 --> 15:29.126
PRETTY STRONG FAVORS
OUR CANDIDATE.

15:29.230 --> 15:30.879
- WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.
- YEAH.

15:30.990 --> 15:31.991
OUR CANDIDATE
IS KRISTINA BRAVERMAN.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.716
SHE'S A HECK OF A CANDIDATE.

15:34.830 --> 15:35.956
ARE YOU A BRAVERMAN SUPPORTER?

15:36.070 --> 15:38.721
- WE'RE REALLY NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

15:38.830 --> 15:39.899
NAM E, PLEASE.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.627
- CROSBY BRAVERMAN.
- BRAVERMAN.

15:41.730 --> 15:43.482
- JUST LIKE THE CANDIDATE,
KRISTINA BRAVERMAN.

15:43.590 --> 15:46.525
- I DON'T SEE YOUR NAME
ON OUR LIST.

15:46.630 --> 15:48.109
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS
YOUR POLLING PLACE?

15:48.220 --> 15:51.257
- WELL, I LIVE RIGHT UP
THE STREET, SO I--

15:51.360 --> 15:52.873
- WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN A POSTCARD

15:52.980 --> 15:54.459
WITH YOUR POLLING PLACE ON IT.

15:54.570 --> 15:57.607
- RIGHT,
THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE THE PLACE.

15:57.710 --> 15:58.460
IT'S SO CLOSE TO MY HOUSE.

15:58.570 --> 16:02.336
- HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOU VOTED?

16:02.440 --> 16:04.579
- THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY RELEVANT.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.648
IF THERE'S A FORM OR SOMETHING
I'VE GOT TO FILL OUT--

16:06.750 --> 16:08.126
- THE VOTER REGISTRATION FORM.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.992
YOU CAN'T REGISTER TO VOTE
THE DAY OF THE ELECTION.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.409
- WHY NOT?

16:12.520 --> 16:14.795
- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY.

16:14.900 --> 16:15.969
- OKAY, LISTEN TO ME.

16:16.070 --> 16:17.446
I AM AN AMERICAN CITIZEN
WHO PAY MY TAXES.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.108
MY FATHER IS A VIETNAM VET,
AND THE BRAVERMANS--

16:20.220 --> 16:21.972
- SIR, NOW YOU ARE
HOLDING UP THE LINE.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.662
- I'M JUST--
KRISTINA BRAVERMAN.

16:24.770 --> 16:25.839
IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY

16:25.950 --> 16:27.076
FOR ME TO SORT THIS OUT,
I NEED TO VOTE.

16:27.190 --> 16:29.977
- AND I NEED YOU TO LEAVE.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.843
YOU ARE NOT REGISTERED HERE.

16:32.950 --> 16:33.939
- BUT DON'T WE GET TO GO INSIDE

16:34.060 --> 16:35.504
AND PUSH ALL THE BUTTONS?

16:35.610 --> 16:39.091
- LISTEN, OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I WANTED TO VOTE PRIVATELY,

16:39.200 --> 16:39.985
BUT NOW SHE HAS FORCED US

16:40.100 --> 16:42.477
TO VOTE PUBLICLY,
WHICH IS FINE.

16:42.580 --> 16:43.820
WE'LL VOTE PUBLICLY.

16:43.930 --> 16:45.090
SO I, CROSBY BRAVERMAN,

16:45.210 --> 16:47.064
VOTE FOR KRISTINA BRAVERMAN

16:47.170 --> 16:49.616
FOR MAYOR.
- ME TOO.

16:49.730 --> 16:50.799
- WE VOTED PUBLICLY.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.037
YOU GUYS WITNESSED IT.

16:52.140 --> 16:55.007
MARK IT DOWN, AND WE'LL
SEE YOU WHEN SHE WINS.

16:57.870 --> 17:00.430
- SO DO YOU WANT
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

17:00.530 --> 17:01.974
- WHAT?

17:02.090 --> 17:03.944
- DO YOU WANT
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

17:04.050 --> 17:05.984
- UM...

17:06.090 --> 17:09.708
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.913
- WHY?
- EXCUSE ME.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.407
I'M DOING SOMETHING.

17:21.310 --> 17:24.518
- HEY, RUBY,
COME HERE FOR A SECOND PLEASE.

17:28.390 --> 17:29.243
- WHAT?

17:29.350 --> 17:31.591
- JUST BE, LIKE, NICER TO HIM.

17:31.700 --> 17:32.485
ALL RIGHT?
- WHAT?

17:32.600 --> 17:34.591
- JUST MAX.
JUST CUT HIM A BREAK.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.634
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE'S THE ONE--

17:36.740 --> 17:40.676
- I'M JUST SAYING BE
A LITTLE BIT NICER, THAT'S ALL.

17:40.780 --> 17:41.769
- SO BE HIS GIRLFRIEND?

17:41.880 --> 17:45.156
- NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

17:45.270 --> 17:47.261
LOOK, HE'S NOT GONNA
DO ANYTHING.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.986
HE JUST WANTS TO SAY
HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND, THAT'S ALL.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.137
IT'S A GUY THING.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.822
I MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN MINNESOTA, RIGHT?

17:55.930 --> 17:58.307
SO WHAT'S THE HARM REALLY?

17:58.420 --> 18:00.035
OH, DON'T--
COME ON.

18:00.140 --> 18:02.199
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.072
- ALL RIGHT, RUBY.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.284
- I'M CALLING MOM.

18:06.390 --> 18:07.800
- DO NOT CALL MOM.

18:07.910 --> 18:09.002
DON'T CALL MOM.
- BYE.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.975
[bluesy music playing]

18:24.580 --> 18:26.502
- VICTOR SLAMMED THE DOOR.
- I KNOW.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.508
- AND HE SAID THE "S" WORD
IN THE CAR.

18:28.620 --> 18:29.541
- I KNOW.

18:29.660 --> 18:31.616
- SO NO DESSERT, RIGHT?

18:31.730 --> 18:32.924

18:33.040 --> 18:35.622
HEY, BUDDY, LISTEN--

18:35.730 --> 18:36.765
- SHUT THE HELL UP, SYDNEY.

18:36.870 --> 18:38.724
- MOM, DID YOU JUST
HEAR WHAT HE JUST SAID?

18:38.840 --> 18:39.625
- VICTOR, STOP RIGHT NOW.

18:39.730 --> 18:40.799
SYDNEY, GO TO YOUR ROOM
RIGHT NOW.

18:40.910 --> 18:42.457
- THAT'S SO UNFAIR.
- SYDNEY, GO TO YOUR ROOM

18:42.560 --> 18:44.141
SO I CAN TALK TO YOUR BROTHER.
VICTOR, COME HERE PLEASE.

18:44.260 --> 18:45.807
- THIS IS SO UNFAIR!
- CAN YOU COME BACK HERE?

18:45.910 --> 18:47.218
- YOU DON'T EVEN--
- OKAY.

18:47.330 --> 18:50.015
HEY.
I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU,

18:50.120 --> 18:52.600
BUT IT'S THE BEST THING FOR YOU.
- WHY, BECAUSE I'M A 'TARD?

18:52.710 --> 18:54.086
- NO.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.918
DON'T USE THAT WORD
ABOUT YOURSELF, OKAY,

18:56.030 --> 18:56.883
OR ABOUT ANYBODY.
- WHY NOT?

18:56.990 --> 18:58.719
IT'S TRUE.
- IT'S NOT TRUE, VICTOR.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.378
- WELL, ETHAN AND
HIS ASSHAT FRIENDS SAID IT,

19:00.480 --> 19:01.686
SO IT MUST BE TRUE.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.473
- ETHAN SAID THAT?
I WILL TALK TO THE SCHOOL.

19:03.590 --> 19:04.750
I'LL TALK TO HIS MOTHER--
- THAT WILL JUST MAKE IT WORSE.

19:04.860 --> 19:08.068
- LISTEN, I KNOW THIS IS
ROUGH, BUDDY, BUT THIS IS--

19:08.180 --> 19:09.966
- IT'S FOR THE BEST.
I KNOW, JULIA.

19:10.070 --> 19:11.480
YOU SAID IT A MILLION TIMES.

19:11.590 --> 19:13.524
- CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS, BUDDY?

19:13.630 --> 19:17.669
- WHY DID YOU SAY I WAS SMART,
WHEN I'M DUMB?

19:17.770 --> 19:18.077
- SWEETH EART. ..

19:18.190 --> 19:20.283

19:33.310 --> 19:36.370
- 'CAUSE I WANT TO CONFESS
TO YOU THAT...

19:36.480 --> 19:38.755
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO DO THIS.

19:41.730 --> 19:44.062
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE READY
TO HANDLE

19:44.180 --> 19:47.172
THE STRESS Al-TER CANCER,
BUT YOU...

19:47.280 --> 19:49.737
YOU WERE READY,

19:49.840 --> 19:52.308
AND I AM SO PROUD OF YOU,
WIN OR LOSE.

19:52.430 --> 19:54.182
KRISTINA,
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

19:54.290 --> 19:57.874
- THANKS.

19:57.980 --> 20:00.084

I REALLY WANT THIS.

20:00.190 --> 20:01.157

20:01.260 --> 20:04.127
[gentle ballad playing]

20:13.240 --> 20:14.753

20:27.530 --> 20:29.111
[doorbell dings,

20:31.850 --> 20:34.080
[door opens]
- HEY.

20:34.190 --> 20:35.179
HELLO.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.222
OH, MY GOD!

20:37.330 --> 20:38.194
- HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

20:38.300 --> 20:39.221
- DIDN'T YOU SAY COME IN?

20:39.340 --> 20:40.159
- NO, I SAID, "WHO IS IT?"

20:40.270 --> 20:41.237
- OH, THE DOOR WAS OPEN.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.739
LISTEN, I NEED A WOMAN, NOW.

20:42.860 --> 20:43.997
_ UH--

20:44.100 --> 20:45.089
- MY DAUGHTER'S HERE FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS, SO RELAX.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.167
- OH.

20:46.270 --> 20:48.443
- AND IT'S A DISASTER.

20:48.550 --> 20:49.892
TEARS HAVE BEEN SHED.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.035
STUFF HAS BEEN THROWN.

20:51.140 --> 20:52.243
- WHY, WHAT HAPPENED?

20:52.350 --> 20:53.248
- MAX ASKED HER
TO BE HIS GIRLFRIEND.

20:53.350 --> 20:55.693
- WELL, THEY'LL BE VERY
HAPPY TOGETHER.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.698
SHE'S A HOTTIE.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.937
- TRYING TO BE FUNNY?
REALLY? JUST--

20:58.040 --> 20:59.177
- LISTEN, I KNOW.
I'M SURE IT'S VERY STRESSFUL.

20:59.290 --> 21:02.635
JUST TELL THEM THEY
HAVE TO USE PROTECTION.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.803
- YOU KNOW,
I COME HERE FOR ADVICE--

21:05.910 --> 21:08.151
- WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T GET WHAT'S WRONG.

21:08.260 --> 21:09.227
- WHAT'S WRONG?
SHE'S NOT READY FOR THIS.

21:09.330 --> 21:12.265
AND MAX DOESN'T, YOU KNOW,

21:12.370 --> 21:14.224
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WHY HE WANTS A GIRLFRIEND.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.570
HE'S JUST CHECKING
STUFF OFF A LIST.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.124
- YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THIS.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.162
SHE'S 14 AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

21:20.270 --> 21:21.510
- SHE'S NOT READY.
SHE'S NOT READY, OKAY?

21:21.620 --> 21:22.689
- OKAY.
- AND BY THE WAY,

21:22.790 --> 21:24.758
SHE THINKS HE'S WEIRD,
YOU KNOW.

21:24.860 --> 21:25.997
- OF COURSE SHE DOES,

21:26.110 --> 21:28.761
BUT WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?

21:28.870 --> 21:29.723
- SHE JUST, YOU KNOW,

21:29.840 --> 21:30.522
SHE THINKS I'M TRYING
TO SELL HER

21:30.630 --> 21:32.382
INTO PROSTITUTION OR SOMETHING.

21:32.490 --> 21:33.798
- OH, MY GOD.
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?

21:33.910 --> 21:36.356
- I TOLD HER,
WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST

21:36.460 --> 21:38.143
PRETEND TO BE HIS GIRLFRIEND,

21:38.260 --> 21:39.215
BECAUSE SHE'S GOING
TO MINNESOTA.

21:39.330 --> 21:41.355
- OH, MY GOD.
- SHE'S GOING AWAY.

21:41.470 --> 21:42.732
THERE'S NO HARM.
THERE'S NO FOUL.

21:42.850 --> 21:44.818
HE DOESN'T KNOW.
- THAT'S THE WORST ADVICE--

21:44.920 --> 21:46.012
OF COURSE SHE'S UPSET.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.530
YOU TOLD HER TO LIE TO MAX.

21:48.650 --> 21:50.129
- TO BE NICE, NOT LIE.
JUST BE NICE.

21:50.230 --> 21:51.367
- THAT'S NOT BEING NICE THOUGH.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.640
IT TEACHES HER
THAT YOU LIE

21:52.750 --> 21:54.377
TO GET OUT
OF A TRICKY SITUATION,

21:54.480 --> 21:56.516
AND ANYWAY, FOR HIM, YOU KNOW,

21:56.620 --> 21:58.508
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT,

21:58.620 --> 22:01.066
YOU DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND JUST
BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU LIKE HER.

22:01.180 --> 22:04.832
SHE HAS TO LIKE YOU BACK.
IT'S A TWO-WAY STREET.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.239
- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.179
OH, GIRLS ARE THE WORST.

22:11.290 --> 22:13.975
- HUH?

22:14.090 --> 22:16.149
- I SAID THANKS, YEAH.

22:16.260 --> 22:17.249
- OKAY.
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.361
ALL RIGHT.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.153
YOU SHOULD REALLY LOCK THIS,
OKAY?

22:21.270 --> 22:24.671
THERE'S A WEIRD GUY.
I SAW A COYOTE.

22:24.790 --> 22:25.336
THAN KS.

22:33.070 --> 22:36.483
- HEY, IT'S ME, AGAIN.

22:36.590 --> 22:38.342
I KNOW I'VE CALLED

22:38.460 --> 22:40.269

23:32.100 --> 23:34.500

23:34.620 --> 23:35.882

23:37.130 --> 23:38.267

23:38.380 --> 23:40.336

- WELL, DADDY VOTED PUBLIC.

23:40.450 --> 23:43.374

AT THE TABLE

23:43.490 --> 23:44.377
WHO HE WA%\H/OTING FOR.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.697
- THAT'S VOgIIING PUBLIC.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.279
- THE PEOPLE THAT GO INTO
THE BOOTH ARE VOTING PRIVATE.

23:48.390 --> 23:50.938
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID,
DADDY?

23:51.050 --> 23:53.427
- I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA GET SWAMPED HERE

23:53.530 --> 23:57.591
IF YOU DON'T--I MAY HAVE
SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

23:57.710 --> 23:59.666
SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE--

26:28.310 --> 26:29.618
UP THROUGH THE KITCHEN
TO THE SECOND FLOOR.

26:29.720 --> 26:30.994
- AND WE CAN JUST
ADD THE TOILETS

26:31.100 --> 26:32.237
AND ALL THAT STUFF...
- YEAH, WE DID IT!

26:32.340 --> 26:33.443
- RIGHT OVER THERE.
DONE.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.371
- HAVE YOU TRIED THE EEL,
CAUSE IT'S INSANE, ISN'T IT?

26:36.490 --> 26:37.798
I'M TELLING YOU, IT COMES FROM
THIS LITTLE HOLE IN THE WALL.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.697
IT'S THE BEST SUSHI
IN THE BAY AREA.

26:39.800 --> 26:43.099
- SO, IF WE HAVE THIS--

26:43.220 --> 26:43.868
HEY.
- HI.

26:43.980 --> 26:46.141
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

26:46.250 --> 26:47.729
- CAN I TALK TO YOU?

26:47.840 --> 26:48.704
- WHERE ARE THE KIDS?
ARE TH EY--

26:48.810 --> 26:49.731
- THEY'RE AT MY PARENTS'.

26:49.840 --> 26:52.047
CAN I TALK TO YOU, PLEASE?

26:52.160 --> 26:54.947
- NOTHING'S AN EMERGENCY.
- NOBODY'S BLEEDING,

26:55.060 --> 26:57.915
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU,
AND I'VE CALLED YOU FIVE TIMES--

26:58.030 --> 26:59.986
- THAT'S MY FAULT,
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN TURNING--

27:00.100 --> 27:02.091
- YOU KNOW,
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU, PEET.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.815
- JULIA.
- OKAY, I--

27:03.930 --> 27:06.376
- JULIA.
- MAY I TALK TO YOU, PLEASE?

27:06.480 --> 27:07.469
- NO, NO, YOU'RE FINE.

27:07.590 --> 27:09.820
YOU'RE FINE,
PLEASE, STAY.

27:09.930 --> 27:13.866
JULIA,
I'M WORKING RIGHT NOW,

27:13.970 --> 27:17.838
AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS
WHEN I GET HOME.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.708
- I'LL SEE YOU WHENEVER THAT IS.

27:36.410 --> 27:39.789
- SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU
NEVER VOTED, LIKE, EVER.

27:39.890 --> 27:42.518
- WHEN YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT,
IT SOUNDS VERY JUDGMENTAL.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.827
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD REPHRASE
IT IN A LESS JUDGMENTAL WAY?

27:44.930 --> 27:45.965
- I DON'T THINK I CAN.

27:46.070 --> 27:47.697
WHAT MORE IMPORTANT THING
WERE YOU DOING

27:47.800 --> 27:49.449
OTHER THAN VOTING
FOR BARACK OBAMA IN 2008, HUH?

27:49.560 --> 27:52.108
- I WAS INCAPACITATED IN NAPA
DURING THAT ELECTION.

27:52.220 --> 27:54.768
- OH, NAPA? NAPA.
WHAT HAPPENED TO CRYING?

27:54.880 --> 27:56.211
YOU KNOW, YOU SAID YOU CRIED
LIKE A BABY.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.834
- YOU WERE GETTING
VERY EMOTIONAL,

27:58.950 --> 28:01.043
AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR ANCESTORS AND STUFF...

28:01.160 --> 28:02.115
- NO, I WASN'T.

28:02.230 --> 28:03.743
- AND I GOT SUCKED UP
INTO IT A LITTLE BIT.

28:03.850 --> 28:04.817
YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE 15TH AMENDMENT...

28:04.920 --> 28:06.501
- NO, I WASN'T.
- AND CIVIL RIGHTS STUFF.

28:06.610 --> 28:07.838
- CUT THE CRAP.
CUT THE CRAP.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.052
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN VOTE
FOR YOUR OWN SISTER-IN-LAW?

28:09.170 --> 28:10.546
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
- I TRIED TO.

28:10.650 --> 28:11.878
- HOW?

28:12.000 --> 28:13.228
- I WENT DOWN THERE,
AND THEY WOULD NOT LET ME.

28:13.340 --> 28:15.023
NOW, I WAS ASSUMING,
BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY,

28:15.140 --> 28:16.926
THAT I COULD REGISTER DAY OF,
AND GUESS WHAT?

28:17.040 --> 28:18.064
I CAN'T.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

28:18.170 --> 28:20.274
I AM AN UPSTANDING CITIZEN,
AND I TRIED.

28:20.380 --> 28:21.369
- IF SHE LOSES BY ONE VOTE,

28:21.490 --> 28:24.175
WHICH HAPPENS, IT'S YOUR FAULT.

28:35.740 --> 28:36.536
- HEY, MAX.

28:36.640 --> 28:39.848
LET ME TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE.

28:39.950 --> 28:41.918
- ABOUT WHAT?
I'M BUSY WORKING.

28:42.030 --> 28:43.019
- YOU DON'T GOT
TO WORK RIGHT NOW.

28:43.130 --> 28:45.098
JUST STOP FOR A SECOND.
IT'S OKAY.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.952
IT'S MY PLACE, RIGHT,
SO I'M THE BOSS.

28:47.070 --> 28:51.962
SO I JUST WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT RUBY FOR A SECOND.

28:52.070 --> 28:53.162
- SHE ALREADY SAID
SHE DOESN'T WANT

28:53.280 --> 28:54.201
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND,
SO IT'S DONE.

28:54.310 --> 28:57.245
- YEAH, NO.

28:57.350 --> 29:01.901
I KNOW THAT.
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS

29:02.010 --> 29:04.114
HAVING A GIRLFRIEND...
IT'S MORE THAN JUST

29:04.220 --> 29:07.906
BEING THE SAME AGE AND LIKING
THE SAME HOCKEY TEAM.

29:08.020 --> 29:11.945
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.
- THEN WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

29:12.060 --> 29:13.084
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

29:13.190 --> 29:17.809
IT'S, UM,
IT'S ABOUT FEELING STUFF,

29:17.920 --> 29:21.128
YOU KNOW, LIKE, ON THE INSIDE.

29:21.240 --> 29:23.515
MAKING A CONNECTION, I GUESS.

29:23.620 --> 29:25.372
MAKING EACH OTHER LAUGH.

29:25.480 --> 29:28.415
HAVING CONVERSATIONS.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.249
- WHAT IF IT'S HARD?

29:30.350 --> 29:32.966
CONVERSATIONS.

29:35.980 --> 29:39.006
- OH, BELIEVE ME,
IT'S HARD FOR EVERYBODY.

29:39.120 --> 29:42.738
NOT JUST YOU, IT'S...

29:42.850 --> 29:44.533
YOU KNOW,
AND SCREW THE PEOPLE

29:44.640 --> 29:45.868
THAT IT COMES EASY TO,

29:45.990 --> 29:47.844
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT REAL.

29:47.950 --> 29:49.190
LOOK, ME, I DIDN'T HAVE

29:49.300 --> 29:52.849
A GIRLFRIEND UNTIL COLLEGE,
LATE COLLEGE.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.474
THE POINT IS,
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN FOR YOU, MAX.

29:55.580 --> 29:57.195
TRUST ME.

29:59.280 --> 30:05.276
GUYS LIKE US,
JUST GOT TO TAKE TIME, YOU KNOW.

30:05.380 --> 30:07.177
DON'T NEED TO RUSH IT.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.623
OKAY?

30:09.730 --> 30:12.005
- OKAY.

30:12.120 --> 30:15.567
CAN I GO BACK TO WORK NOW?

30:15.670 --> 30:16.250
- YEAH.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.574
- THANKS.

30:30.410 --> 30:33.208
- YEAH, SURE THING, MAX.

30:38.620 --> 30:42.147
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
- HERE, HERE, HERE.

30:42.250 --> 30:44.798
- I ALSO WANT TO SAY,
HERE'S TO THE BEST BAND EVER,

30:44.910 --> 30:46.241
AND LET'S MAKE
SOME ROCK 'N ROLL HISTORY.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.110
- OH, HEY, WE GOT A NEW
HONORARY BAND MATE TOO.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.189
TO HER.
- THERE YOU GO!

30:50.290 --> 30:52.599
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, NO,
YOU'RE SO GOOD, NO.

30:52.710 --> 30:54.632
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

30:54.740 --> 30:56.253
- WHOA.
- NO, BUT SERIOUSLY,

30:56.370 --> 30:58.258
YOU HAVE THE VOICE
OF AN ANGEL, AND IT'S LIKE...

30:58.370 --> 31:00.952
COME ON, HIT ME, HIT ME.
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.402
- SING IT WITH ME.

31:02.510 --> 31:04.262
both: I SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN YOU HOME

31:04.370 --> 31:07.089
- WHY ARE YOU ON THE BOTTOM
AND I'M ON THE TOP?

31:07.210 --> 31:11.135
- OH, THAT'S A NICE WAY TO SLIP
SOMETHING PERW IN THERE.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.172
- THAT WAS GOOD.
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?

31:12.280 --> 31:13.963
- THAT WAS A GOOD COMBO
RIGHT THERE.

31:14.070 --> 31:15.446
I LIKED IT.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:15.560 --> 31:17.209
- DON'T GIVE HIM ANY MORE.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.218
I'M SERIOUS.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.594
HE'S IN TROUBLE.

31:19.700 --> 31:20.769
HANG ON.

31:20.870 --> 31:23.282
[background chatter]

31:23.390 --> 31:24.379
HELLO?

31:24.500 --> 31:26.559
- OH, MY GOD.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

31:26.670 --> 31:27.773
I'VE BEEN CALLING AND CALLING.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.256
- HI.
I'M SORRY, BABE,

31:29.370 --> 31:31.088
I TOTALLY SPACED OUT,
I'M...

31:31.190 --> 31:32.122
- HEY, HEY, AMBER, AMBER.

31:32.230 --> 31:32.958
- WE FINISHED THE ALBUM TODAY,

31:33.060 --> 31:34.778
AND I CAME AROUND THE CORNER,

31:34.890 --> 31:37.859
JUST TO CELEBRATE WITH THE BAND,
AND STUFF SO, JUST FOR A SECOND,

31:37.960 --> 31:38.676
BUT WE'RE DONE NOW...
- WELL--

31:38.790 --> 31:40.712
- AND I'M GONNA COME RIGHT HOME.

31:40.820 --> 31:42.708
WE DIDN'T SET A TIME OR
ANYTHING, SO I DIDN'T KNOW--

31:42.830 --> 31:44.855
- YOU WERE GETTING OFF EARLY,
SO I'VE BEEN WAITING.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.414
I GOT OFF EARLY TOO.
I'VE JUST BEEN WAITING.

31:46.520 --> 31:47.999
- I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
- I'M SORRY.

31:48.110 --> 31:49.896
- SHH, STOP.
- I GOT YOU A LITTLE ONE.

31:50.010 --> 31:51.409
- I'M SORRY, BABE.
I'M DRIVING NOW, THOUGH.

31:51.530 --> 31:53.009
I'M FINE TO DRIVE.
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

31:53.110 --> 31:54.281
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
- AMBER. AMBER--

31:54.390 --> 31:55.937
- I'M COMING HOME.
SHH, STOP, STOP, STOP!

31:56.050 --> 31:57.187
- AMBER, YOU ARE NOT DRIVING,
OKAY?

31:57.290 --> 31:58.734
I'M COMING TO GET YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

31:58.840 --> 32:00.080
I'M COMING TO YOU.
DON'T LEAVE.

32:00.190 --> 32:01.418
- BABE, I'M SORRY, I--

32:07.820 --> 32:09.811
- OH, HEY, EXCUSE ME, SIR.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.160
MIKE, RIGHT?
- NO, DOUG.

32:11.270 --> 32:12.544
- NO, NO, HEY, I'M CR--
OH, SORRY.

32:12.650 --> 32:13.617
CROSBY.

32:13.720 --> 32:14.436
YOU OWN PIZZA TIME, RIGHT?

32:14.550 --> 32:15.471
- NO.
- OH, YOU DON'T?

32:15.580 --> 32:17.821
ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE?

32:17.930 --> 32:18.897
- YEAH, I WAS TRYING.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.820
- CAN I JUST ASK YOU
A QUICK QUESTION?

32:20.930 --> 32:22.170
I JUST NEED YOUR GUIDANCE
FOR ONE SECOND.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.201
COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

32:23.320 --> 32:26.721
- YEAH.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.831
WHO ARE YOU VOTING FOR?

32:28.940 --> 32:30.077
- BOB LITTLE.

32:30.180 --> 32:32.353
- OH, COME ON, BOB LITTLE?

32:32.460 --> 32:33.449
- YEAH.
- GUY'S A PERVERT.

32:33.570 --> 32:36.186
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT KRISTINA BRAVERMAN?

32:36.290 --> 32:38.804
- OH, COME ON.
- WHAT DON'T YOU LIKE ABOUT HER?

32:38.920 --> 32:40.808
- WHAT?
SHE HUGS EVERYBODY SHE MEETS.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.262
SHE GETS PHONE NUMBERS
FROM HALF THE PEOPLE SHE MEETS.

32:42.370 --> 32:46.158
IF SHE'S LONELY,
SHE SHOULD GO ON A DATE.

32:46.270 --> 32:50.195
NO, SHE CAN'T.
SHE GOT THE VIOLENT HUSBAND.

32:50.310 --> 32:52.449
- YEAH, HE'S A LIABILITY.

32:52.550 --> 32:54.541
LISTEN, DOUG.

32:54.660 --> 32:57.891
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT
I COULD SWAY YOUR VOTE?

32:58.010 --> 33:00.524
- [laughing]
- SHH, COME ON.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.939
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU TRYING TO BUY MY VOTE?

33:03.050 --> 33:04.358
- $20, HARD CASH,

33:04.460 --> 33:07.588
FOR A KRISTINA BRAVERMAN VOTE.

33:07.700 --> 33:08.769
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

33:09.740 --> 33:13.119
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THIS?

33:13.230 --> 33:14.948
- YEAH.
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING ONE VOTE.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.436
YOU'RE GETTING TWO VOTES.

33:16.540 --> 33:19.646
PLUS ONE FOR BRAVERMAN.
MINUS ONE FOR BOB LITTLE.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.479
YOUR ONE, PLUS MY ONE IS TWO.

33:21.580 --> 33:25.619
TWO VOTES IS 40 BUCKS.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.584
- OKAY, I'LL GO 40 BUCKS.

33:26.690 --> 33:28.851
THAT'S LOGICAL.

33:28.970 --> 33:30.369
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE 40 BUCKS,

33:30.490 --> 33:31.684
BUT YOU GOT TO GET ME A STICKER.

33:31.800 --> 33:32.892
- DONE.
- ALL RIGHT.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.204
DON'T FORGET THE STICKER.
BRAVERMAN.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.481
- THEY'LL GIVE YOU A STICKER
IF YOU JUST ASK THEM.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.555
- SHH, JEEZ.

33:37.670 --> 33:40.002
- THE PRETTIEST GIRL
IN THIS BATHROOM

33:40.120 --> 33:42.759
OH, YOU GOT IT!

33:42.880 --> 33:43.904
YOU GOT THE--
HEY.

33:44.020 --> 33:46.079
YOU WANT TO COME MAKE
THE DANCE HAPPEN?

33:46.190 --> 33:46.702
BRING IT.
BRING IT.

33:46.810 --> 33:47.469
I'M NOT SCARED.

33:47.570 --> 33:48.298
I'M NOT SCARED--

33:48.400 --> 33:51.198
WAIT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

33:51.300 --> 33:52.392
I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

33:52.510 --> 33:54.193
- OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE OVER-UNDER IS

33:54.300 --> 33:56.780
ON ROME TAKING COUGAR HOME?

34:01.030 --> 34:02.679
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.

34:02.790 --> 34:03.893
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.683
- I JUST GOT INTO A THING
WITH RYAN, AND--

34:05.800 --> 34:06.960
IT'S MY FAULT.

34:07.070 --> 34:08.514
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO HANG OUT WITH HIM, AND I--

34:08.630 --> 34:11.098
I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL REALLY BAD,
'CAUSE I MESSED UP.

34:11.220 --> 34:13.620
- LOOK, I THINK THAT
IT'S PROBABLY NOT YOUR FAULT.

34:13.740 --> 34:15.253
YOU'RE RECORDING
ON AN ALBUM WITH A BAND.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.042
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME
AND HANG OUT.

34:16.150 --> 34:18.596
- I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE,

34:18.710 --> 34:20.325
LIKE, ONE DRINK,
AND THEN IT TURNED INTO--

34:20.430 --> 34:21.180
- WHEN YOU GUYS ARE DONE
CUDDLING, WE CAN GO.

34:21.300 --> 34:23.393
- HEY, HEY, IT'S NOT THAT.
LET'S GO.

34:23.500 --> 34:24.706
- YOU READY?
- ARE YOU OKAY?

34:24.820 --> 34:26.048
- SHE'S FINE.
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER, DUDE.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.366
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
- HEY, HEY, CHILL, CHILL.

34:27.470 --> 34:28.607
- IS THIS GUY
GIVING YOU TROUBLE?

34:28.720 --> 34:29.948
- OLIVER, STOP, STOP, STOP.
IT'S FINE.

34:30.060 --> 34:31.300
- HEY, HEY--

34:31.410 --> 34:33.640
- HEY, HEY, HEY!
LET GO OF HIM!

34:33.760 --> 34:35.580
RYAN, LET GO OF HIM.
- WHOA, WHOA, CHILL OUT, HEY.

34:35.690 --> 34:37.169
- HEY!
RYAN, NO.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.065
STOP!
RYAN .

34:38.170 --> 34:41.867
RYAN!
RYAN, STOP IT RIGHT NOW!

34:41.970 --> 34:43.722
GET OFF OF HIM, RYAN, PLEASE.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.831
RYAN YORK, GET OFF OF HIM NOW!

34:48.940 --> 34:51.283
- HI, SWEETH EART.

34:51.390 --> 34:52.084
OH, AMBER.
OH, HONEY.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.112
- SORRY.

34:54.230 --> 34:55.629
- OH, SWEETH EART.

34:55.740 --> 35:00.154
- [sobbing, murmuring]
- NO, IT'S OKAY, COME ON.

35:00.270 --> 35:02.431
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
COME ON, SWEETHEART.

35:02.540 --> 35:03.814
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M HERE.

35:15.690 --> 35:17.169
- PLOTTING AND PLANNING
LEI-T AND RIGHT.

35:17.280 --> 35:18.554
- I GUESS.

35:18.660 --> 35:19.695
[laughter]

35:19.800 --> 35:20.482
- I KNEW DREW WAS GONNA
HAVE THIS, LIKE,

35:20.600 --> 35:22.556
COOL, HIP, YOUNG, PRETTY MOM.

35:22.670 --> 35:23.625
- WOW. OKAY...

35:23.740 --> 35:26.948
- DOES DREW KNOW?

35:27.050 --> 35:28.119
- I'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY LATER.

35:28.220 --> 35:29.152
- OH, PLEASE DO.

35:29.260 --> 35:30.329
YEAH, YOU OWE ME FOR THAT.

35:30.430 --> 35:32.489
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU GUYS--
YOU KNOW?

35:32.610 --> 35:34.578
- OH, NO, WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.057
YEAH.
- OH.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.299
- IT'S CASUAL.
- OH.

35:39.410 --> 35:40.957
- VERY CASUAL.
- YEAH.

35:41.060 --> 35:43.642
- CASUAL, YEAH, SURE.

35:43.760 --> 35:44.852
KEEPING IT CASUAL.

35:44.970 --> 35:45.402
- 80% OF VOTES
HAVE BEEN COUNTED,

35:45.520 --> 35:46.726
AND WE'RE 7,000 VOTES AHEAD.

35:46.830 --> 35:48.889
- GOOD.
- GREAT.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.934
- BUT BOB LITTLE'S DISTRICTS
HAVEN'T COME IN YET.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.484
- OH.
- WHO ARE YOU?

35:52.590 --> 35:54.103
- THIS IS NATALIE.
SHE'S MY--

35:54.220 --> 35:55.289
- ARE YOU
BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND?

35:55.390 --> 35:56.527
- NO, WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.
- UM, NO.

35:56.630 --> 35:59.076
- I JUST ASKED
MY FIRST GIRL OUT.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.282
- NICE! GOOD WORK.

36:00.390 --> 36:02.039
- BUT THEN SHE SAID NO.
- WELL, HER LOSS.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.492
- SHE LIVES IN MINNESOTA ANYWAY.
- YEAH.

36:04.610 --> 36:06.601
- AND APPARENTLY LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIPS ARE HELL.

36:06.710 --> 36:07.529
- THAT'S TRUE.

36:07.640 --> 36:10.393
ALL RIGHT.
TALK TO YOU LATER.

36:10.510 --> 36:12.091
- I DON'T SEE WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.644
- YOU BOUGHT A VOTE?

36:13.750 --> 36:14.262
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I BOUGHT A VOTE.

36:14.370 --> 36:16.440
IF SHE WINS BY ONE VOTE,

36:16.550 --> 36:18.268
THAT'S GONNA BE THE BEST
$40 DOLLARS I EVER SPENT.

36:18.380 --> 36:19.711
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

36:19.830 --> 36:21.479
- HOW ARE YOU SO SURE
HE EVEN VOTED FOR KRISTINA?

36:21.590 --> 36:23.205
- WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SUCH A CYNIC?

36:23.310 --> 36:26.029
I SAW IN THIS MAN'S EYES
HE WAS A TRUSTWORTHY MAN.

36:26.140 --> 36:26.799
- OH, REALLY?
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.276
- I MEAN, HE SOLD HIS VOTE,

36:28.390 --> 36:29.664
BUT HE WAS VERY TRUSTWORTHY,
OTHER THAN THAT.

36:29.770 --> 36:30.691
- WE NEED TO TALK.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.142
- I WOULD HAVE TRUSTED HIM
WITH AIDA--

36:32.250 --> 36:33.319
HEY, JOEL.
- HEY, GUYS.

36:33.430 --> 36:34.419
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

36:37.120 --> 36:40.840
- WHAT NUMBER
SANDWICH IS THAT?

36:40.950 --> 36:42.599
THREE MEANS FIVE,
DOESN'T IT?

36:42.710 --> 36:44.291
- I WAS TRYING
TO DEAL WITH VICTOR,

36:44.400 --> 36:45.332
AND HE'S SO UPSET.

36:45.440 --> 36:46.668
- YES.
- HE IS SO UPSET AND--

36:46.790 --> 36:47.859
- THAT'S THE POSITION
YOU WANTED TO BE IN.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.029
- I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT THERE.

36:49.130 --> 36:50.199
- I'M NOT THERE FOR VICTOR?

36:50.310 --> 36:51.447
- I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE NOT EVEN THERE.

36:51.550 --> 36:53.131
- I AM THERE FOR HIM.
I AM THERE FOR SYDNEY.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.343
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

36:54.450 --> 36:55.894
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
I NEEDED YOU IN THAT MOMENT.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.615
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- I FELT LIKE I WAS DROWNING,

36:57.730 --> 36:58.754
AND I COULD NOT
GET A HOLD OF YOU,

36:58.870 --> 37:01.338
AND YOU'RE JUST HAVING
CASUAL SUSHI DINNER.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.382
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

37:03.490 --> 37:05.048
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

37:05.150 --> 37:06.242
- I COULD NOT GET A HOLD OF YOU.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.839
- I NEVER WOULD HAVE WALKED
INTO YOUR OFFICE

37:07.940 --> 37:09.760
WITH LEON DENGRAFF
AND TALKED TO HIM THAT WAY.

37:09.880 --> 37:10.733
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
DONE THAT TO HIM.

37:10.840 --> 37:11.659
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
DONE THAT TO YOU.

37:11.780 --> 37:13.429
- JOEL,
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE WORK.

37:13.540 --> 37:14.529
- I NEVER WOULD HAVE
TREATED HIM THAT WAY.

37:14.640 --> 37:15.607
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
TREATED YOU THAT WAY.

37:15.710 --> 37:19.339
THAT COULD HAVE COST ME MY JOB,
JULIA.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.192
- JOEL, THIS IS ABOUT...
- NINE YEARS.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.676
I GIVE YOU NINE YEARS.
- VICTOR.

37:22.790 --> 37:24.929
- I CHAMPIONED YOU
FOR NINE YEARS,

37:25.030 --> 37:26.236
AND YOU CAN'T GIVE ME--

37:26.340 --> 37:27.614
YOU CAN'T GIVE ME THREE MONTHS.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.096
- THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE WORK.

37:29.210 --> 37:30.541
- IT'S NOT?

37:30.660 --> 37:32.799
- THIS IS ABOUT A FAMILY CRISIS
THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.549
- IT WAS ABOUT THE WORK
WHEN YOU WERE WORKING.

37:34.660 --> 37:35.479
IT WAS ABOUT THE WORK
WHEN YOU WERE WORKING,

37:35.590 --> 37:37.831
AND I WAS THERE FOR YOU.
I SUPPORTED YOU.

37:37.940 --> 37:39.521
- WE NEVER WENT
THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

37:39.630 --> 37:40.904
- I LOOKED OVER EVERY
DEPOSITION YOU HAD.

37:41.010 --> 37:44.730
I WAS THERE TO CHAMPION EVERY
TRIAL, EVERY TRIAL, JULIA.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.946
- I'M SHARING IN YOUR JOY
ON THIS PROJECT, JOEL.

37:48.050 --> 37:49.324
- GREAT, IT REALLY SHOWS.

37:49.430 --> 37:50.874
- BUT WE'RE GOING THROUGH
A FAMILY CRISIS RIGHT NOW.

37:50.990 --> 37:52.150
- OKAY, OKAY, WELL--

37:52.270 --> 37:53.771
- AND I FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE NOT THERE.

37:53.890 --> 37:54.572
- WELL, I'LL BE THERE.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.295
I'LL GO SOLVE IT RIGHT NOW.

37:56.410 --> 38:00.881
TELL KRISTINA I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T BE HERE FOR YOU

38:01.000 --> 38:02.854
AND THERE FOR OUR CHILDREN.

38:09.180 --> 38:09.965
- GOD.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.581
- OKAY, SO WHAT IS THE LATEST?

38:11.700 --> 38:13.144
- YOU KNOW,
WE'RE HANGING IN THERE.

38:13.250 --> 38:14.069
YOU KNOW, WE'RE DOWN A BIT,

38:14.180 --> 38:15.693
BUT IT'S CLOSE, SO...
- OKAY.

38:15.810 --> 38:17.562
- JUST WAITING
FOR DISTRICT FOUR TO COME IN.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.217
- DISTRICT FOUR,
THAT'S BOB LITTLE COUNTRY.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.150
- YEAH, BUT YOUR NUMBERS HAVE
BEEN GETTING BETTER THERE.

38:21.260 --> 38:23.945
- WHEN DO WE EXPECT THE DISTRICT
FOUR NUMBERS TO COME IN?

38:24.060 --> 38:25.129
- YOU KNOW, ANY MINUTE.

38:25.230 --> 38:26.879
YOU GOT YOUR SPEECHES?
- YES, I DO.

38:26.990 --> 38:28.605
I'VE GOT THE WINNING
AND I'VE GOT THE LOSING.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.335
HEATHER, WHAT DOES
YOUR GUT TELL YOU?

38:30.440 --> 38:31.919
- YOU KNOW,
MY GUT TELLS ME THAT IT'S CLOSE.

38:32.030 --> 38:33.577
- WELL, THAT IS NOT HELPING
ME RIGHT NOW.

38:33.690 --> 38:35.408
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, KRISTINA,
GET SOME BOOZE.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.307
YOU KNOW,
IT'LL CALM YOUR NERVES.

38:38.410 --> 38:40.924
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT EITHER WAY.

38:41.040 --> 38:47.036
AND, LOOK, HEY,
EITHER WAY, YOU DID GREAT.

38:47.150 --> 38:50.597
REALLY.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.804
- WE'RE GONNA LOSE.
- HEY.

38:52.910 --> 38:54.354
- DID YOU SEE THAT
LOOK ON HER FACE?

38:54.470 --> 38:55.846
HONEY, WE'RE GOING DOWN.

38:55.950 --> 38:58.635
- I JUST THINK--I THINK SHE HAS
A LITTLE INDIGESTION.

39:01.470 --> 39:02.744
ALL RIGHT?

39:02.850 --> 39:03.748
DON'T READ TOO MUCH
INTO THIS STUFF, OKAY?

39:03.850 --> 39:05.499
- I'M JUST NERVOUS.
- I KNOW.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.680
LET ME GET YOU
THAT DRINK, ALL RIGHT?

39:07.790 --> 39:08.882
OKAY, HONEY?

39:09.000 --> 39:09.887
- MM.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.331
- OKAY?

39:14.690 --> 39:17.727
[upbeat music playing]

39:19.490 --> 39:23.859
[cheers and applause]

39:30.090 --> 39:32.183
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

39:41.820 --> 39:43.230
THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH.

39:43.340 --> 39:45.399
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH BOB LITTLE,

39:49.040 --> 39:50.416
[audience groans]

39:50.520 --> 39:51.623
IT'S A BUMMER.

39:51.730 --> 39:54.836
IT WAS VERY CLOSE,
BUT HE RAN A GREAT RACE,

39:54.940 --> 39:58.558
AND I THINK THAT BOB IS GOING
TO MAKE AN INCREDIBLE MAYOR.

39:58.670 --> 40:01.946
I JUST WANT TO TAKE THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THANK YOU

40:02.050 --> 40:04.462
SO MUCH ALL OF YOU
THAT HAVE SUPPORTED ME

40:04.570 --> 40:05.912
THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN,

40:06.020 --> 40:10.229
AND I MEAN THAT FROM THE BOTTOM
OF MY HEART.

40:10.330 --> 40:12.469
YOU KNOW,
SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS,

40:12.580 --> 40:14.957
BUT A YEAR AGO,

40:15.060 --> 40:19.781
I THOUGHT I MIGHT
NOT EVEN BE HERE TODAY,

40:19.900 --> 40:21.993
AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING
WHEN I SAY THAT.

40:22.100 --> 40:25.445
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY
THINGS WERE GOING TO TURN OUT.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.653
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY
HOW GRATEFUL

40:27.770 --> 40:30.625
I AM THAT I ACTUALLY AM HERE,
AND WITH

40:30.730 --> 40:34.769
YOUR HELP I'M ABLE
TO FULFILL A DREAM OF MINE

40:34.880 --> 40:36.700
THAT I NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

40:36.810 --> 40:38.869
ALL OF YOU, I JUST THANK YOU,

40:38.980 --> 40:40.868
AND I REALLY WANT TO STAY
IN TOUCH WITH YOU.

40:40.990 --> 40:43.049
MOST OF YOU HAVE
MY CELL PHONE NUMBER...

40:43.160 --> 40:44.081
[laughter]

40:44.200 --> 40:45.189
WHICH IS GOOD.

40:45.300 --> 40:46.119
HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT,

40:46.230 --> 40:47.083
AND I LOVE YOU ALL.

40:47.200 --> 40:48.337
THANK YOU.

40:48.440 --> 40:51.000
[cheers and applause]

40:53.480 --> 40:55.892
- GOOD JOB.

41:04.040 --> 41:07.077
- HI.

41:07.180 --> 41:09.114
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.

41:09.220 --> 41:10.733
YOU KICKED BUTT.

41:13.470 --> 41:15.222
- HI, IT'S CAROLINE LEE
FROM THE DEBATE.

41:15.330 --> 41:16.228
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

41:16.330 --> 41:17.228
- SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

41:17.330 --> 41:18.251
- NICE TO SEE YOU,

41:18.370 --> 41:21.601
AND THIS IS MY DAUGHTER, EMMA,

41:21.720 --> 41:23.745
AND SHE WANTS
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

41:23.860 --> 41:25.612
- YEAH.

41:28.520 --> 41:35.278
- SHE SAYS, "BECAUSE OF YOU
I'VE MOVED TO A BETTER SCHOOL

41:35.380 --> 41:36.586
"AND A BETTER CLASSROOM

41:36.700 --> 41:40.830
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE
HELPING ME TO LEARN."

41:40.940 --> 41:44.455
SHE SAYS "THANK YOU
FOR CHANGING MY LIFE,"

41:44.570 --> 41:46.322
AND MINE.

41:46.430 --> 41:47.351
- OH, YOU'VE JUST CHANGED MINE.

41:47.470 --> 41:48.949
THAT MEANS MORE
TO ME THAN ANYTHING

41:49.050 --> 41:50.699
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
THANK YOU, EMMA.

41:50.810 --> 41:51.845
CAN I GIVE YOU A HUG?

41:51.950 --> 41:53.577
- DEFINITELY.

41:53.680 --> 41:56.535
- JOY TO YOU, BABY

41:56.650 --> 42:01.019
JOY TO ME TOO TONIGHT

42:01.130 --> 42:03.519
TONIGHT, TONIGHT
