I urge you to believe me.

I'm doing this for you.

02:13.923 --> 02:16.548
I have an idea. Fuller thrusters!

02:16.631 --> 02:19.381
You know what humans say
the definition of insanity is?

02:19.465 --> 02:23.673
Doing the same thing over and over again.
And expecting different results.

02:23.756 --> 02:25.465
Well, they also say,

02:25.631 --> 02:28.423
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again."

02:28.756 --> 02:30.506

02:45.131 --> 02:47.298
Atlas, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

02:47.381 --> 02:51.631
Of course... I...
thought of it before you did.

02:51.715 --> 02:53.798
I was just waiting for you to catch up.

I don't know which is more impressive,

what they're doing
or that they're doing it together.

03:04.131 --> 03:08.048
I have no idea what they're doing.
So for me it's the second one.

03:08.131 --> 03:11.923
Done. If this works, we'll reverse
the magnetic polarity of the Pluto.

03:12.006 --> 03:15.090
-So instead of attracting, we repel!
-Hm.

Bad. Bad.

04:40.090 --> 04:41.965
[Chonies] Scans confirm, Captain.

This isn't your ship!

04:55.048 --> 04:57.756
It won't be yours after this.
You were on her side!

04:57.840 --> 05:00.465
Because I know how she feels.

05:00.548 --> 05:01.923
You guys trust me, right?

05:02.006 --> 05:04.715

-[pants, howls]

05:07.756 --> 05:10.756
If we show her Olga's message,
I know she'll come around!

05:10.840 --> 05:13.090
It's proof our humans never gave up on us.

05:13.173 --> 05:16.381
That planet you crashed on
acted as a kind of transmission magnet

05:16.465 --> 05:18.715
and the fireflies absorbed the raw data.

05:18.798 --> 05:22.548
With them I can build a beacon
so Kira can see the message from Olga!

05:22.631 --> 05:24.215
[scoffs] You think you can build

05:24.298 --> 05:27.256
a frequency beacon strong enough
to cut across the whole M-Bark?

05:27.340 --> 05:28.756
Have you got a better idea?

05:28.840 --> 05:29.840
I do.

05:29.923 --> 05:32.006
We get to the genetic enhancement machine,

05:32.090 --> 05:34.423
turn everyone back to normal,
and arrest Kira!

05:34.506 --> 05:37.340
Perhaps we could neutralize her
by turning her into a dog.

05:37.423 --> 05:39.840
[scoffs] The irony
would be most satisfying.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.090
Hey, then you're just as bad as she is!

05:42.173 --> 05:44.506
No. We're the good guys.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.756

06:16.840 --> 06:19.381
That's right. It's me. Garbage.

06:24.756 --> 06:27.173
And like a Christmas tree in January,

06:27.256 --> 06:29.256
I'm gonna take you down.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.090

06:45.506 --> 06:48.048
You know it takes four dogs
to control the M-Bark.

06:48.131 --> 06:49.798
You can't do them all at once!

06:49.881 --> 06:52.173
Or can you? Buh-bye!

When I find the machine, I'll signal you.

build the beacon.

07:32.215 --> 07:33.881

-Yes, Captain.

I need to show you.

You shouldn't have come back, Garbage.

-Just listen to me. We found these fire--
-I've heard enough.

08:29.090 --> 08:33.506
I won't let your misplaced loyalty
prevent me from saving these dogs!

08:35.048 --> 08:37.840
I told you that you shouldn't have
come back.

08:38.465 --> 08:40.548

Oh! You're even more annoying in dog form
than you are in regular form.

[grunts] Ow!

The whole M-Bark's on lockdown, Garbage.

[grunts]

12:59.465 --> 13:01.173
-Ha ha!
-[grunts]

13:01.256 --> 13:03.256
-Ah!
-[grunting]

13:03.340 --> 13:05.090
-[gasps]
-[grunts]

13:06.340 --> 13:08.465
[clicks, beeps, powers up]

13:09.715 --> 13:11.340
[Captain Garbage straining]

13:13.173 --> 13:14.423
Captain, it's ready!

13:14.506 --> 13:16.006
-[grunts]
-[fireflies murmur]

13:16.590 --> 13:18.798
[Olga] Hello, my treasure.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.465
I hope that this message finds you,

13:21.548 --> 13:22.965
wherever you are.

13:23.798 --> 13:26.173
I've tried every frequency,

13:26.256 --> 13:28.923
every direction, every satellite relay

13:29.006 --> 13:33.298
and I'll try them all again,
for as long as it takes for you to know,

13:33.381 --> 13:36.465
I'm looking for you, and I will find you!

13:37.298 --> 13:40.631
-Be a good girl, Kira.
-Olga!

13:42.840 --> 13:46.256
[Kira crying]

13:48.006 --> 13:52.715
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.423
-[sighs]
-[Kira crying]

13:56.006 --> 13:58.715
-[gasps]
-Happy, what are you doing?

13:58.798 --> 14:00.673
Saving the M-Bark.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.298
But the message! Olga. It worked!

14:03.381 --> 14:06.798
I can't trust you, Garbage.
You two still might be in cahoots!

14:06.881 --> 14:09.048
Who even says cahoots these days?

14:09.131 --> 14:10.715
Don't think I won't zap you too!

14:10.798 --> 14:14.548
Perhaps being a dog would make you
a more obedient Capt-- Oh, god!

14:14.631 --> 14:15.923
-[Stella growls]
-Get off me!

14:16.006 --> 14:18.131
-[whines]
-[Ed growls]

14:23.048 --> 14:26.006
Kira, you know how to put
everyone back, right?

14:31.340 --> 14:32.423
[sighs]

14:36.715 --> 14:40.090
Well, you still ate it.
So... here's the check.

14:40.173 --> 14:45.256
[barks, screams]

14:46.506 --> 14:47.881
[growls]

14:49.090 --> 14:50.715
[growls]

14:50.798 --> 14:53.548
[barks]

14:53.631 --> 14:55.798
Bark, bark, bark, aw, snap.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.298
[gasps]

15:00.381 --> 15:03.090
[gasp] Captain. I am so, so sorry.

15:03.173 --> 15:05.006
Uh... Hm. Excuse me.

15:06.423 --> 15:08.590
You're under arrest.

15:09.548 --> 15:10.923
Duchess, no!

15:11.006 --> 15:12.548
It's okay, Garbage.

15:12.631 --> 15:14.381
It's okay.

15:20.590 --> 15:22.215
SOME TIME LATER...

15:22.298 --> 15:24.298
[indistinct conversations]

15:29.423 --> 15:31.756
Hey, Chelsea! It's me, ya boy!

15:32.465 --> 15:34.881
Long time, no speak, I know. So...

15:34.965 --> 15:38.548
Anyway, the council was very split over
what to do with Kira.

15:38.631 --> 15:41.173
-[the Council chattering]
-Order. Order!

15:41.256 --> 15:44.590
We should banish her
and banish Garbage! Banish the Pluto!

15:44.673 --> 15:46.798
She just needs obedience training.

15:46.881 --> 15:49.340
Trial by combat! Trial by combat!

15:49.423 --> 15:51.465
Or... just a regular trial?

15:51.548 --> 15:54.548
[Captain Garbage]
So... I had to improvise.

15:55.756 --> 15:59.631
And after just a few dog hours of talking,
I had a brilliant idea.

16:02.756 --> 16:05.340
Something to remember me by, kid.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.173
-Hey, that's mine!
-And now it's hers.

16:10.340 --> 16:11.756
I'm still mad at you.

16:12.673 --> 16:15.756
But also I learned a lot
about butt-kicking from you

16:15.840 --> 16:19.298
and then I kicked your butt
which saved the M-Bark. So...

16:20.756 --> 16:23.715
Thanks. Say hi to Earth for me!

16:23.965 --> 16:27.381
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'm kind of glad you're leaving.

16:27.465 --> 16:29.548
What's the right way to take that?

16:32.965 --> 16:36.340
For what it's worth, I think you'll make
a great Captain someday.

16:36.506 --> 16:39.340
A great Captain wouldn't let you
take over the ship

16:39.423 --> 16:42.465
or turn me into a dog or...
[clears throat]

16:42.548 --> 16:45.048
Thank you. That's... kind.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.840
I'll check in on Chelsea
as soon as I get back.

16:49.923 --> 16:52.423
Well... Give her this. From me.

16:56.965 --> 16:59.881
[whimpers] Ahh!

16:59.965 --> 17:01.923
[Captain Garbage] And we
didn't send her back alone.

17:02.006 --> 17:04.798
She's got 300 messages in a bottle.

17:04.881 --> 17:08.465
One from every dog to their humans.
Mine was the longest,

17:09.215 --> 17:12.048
but I'm still going to send messages
out into the stars for you.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.965
Just like I know you will from Earth.

17:18.006 --> 17:21.256
Live un-boxing! Happy adopt-versary!

17:21.340 --> 17:25.090
[gasps] Oooooh!

17:26.173 --> 17:29.673
A perfect fit! I love it! And--

17:29.756 --> 17:32.131
-[Chelsea] And I love you, Garbage.
-[gasps]

17:32.215 --> 17:34.381
I know these messages
probably won't reach you,

17:34.631 --> 17:38.048
but on the off chance they do,
I miss you so much.

17:38.131 --> 17:41.215
I hope you're having fun out there.
We're counting on you, boy.

17:41.298 --> 17:43.298
Don't get a new owner!

17:43.381 --> 17:44.965
Okay. Bye.

17:45.215 --> 17:47.590
[fireflies murmuring]

17:48.173 --> 17:51.256
The fireflies have thousands
of tunable frequencies,

17:51.340 --> 17:53.215
and if Olga's message came through,

17:53.298 --> 17:56.173
-it stood to-- [grunts]
-Not now, Chonies.

17:58.548 --> 18:02.590
Garbage?
Sorry. Sorry to interrupt but, um.

18:02.673 --> 18:04.590
Stella? You okay? What's wrong?

18:04.673 --> 18:07.256
I wanted to tell you first, I've um...

18:07.340 --> 18:09.256
I've been promoted.
I've been made Captain...

18:09.340 --> 18:11.590
-[Nomi gasps]
-[celebratory sounds]

18:13.340 --> 18:15.381
-...of the Pluto.
-[all gasp]

18:16.131 --> 18:18.715
Whaaaaaaaat?

18:19.465 --> 18:22.465
