<i> Previously on Tyrant...</i>

00:03.085 --> 00:05.850
I'm an Al Fayeed. That
means I'm a powerful man here.

00:05.885 --> 00:07.520
Are you saying
you want to stay?

00:07.555 --> 00:09.190
Jamal, it's,
uh, it's me, Bassam.

00:09.225 --> 00:10.550
What would you think if I
hung around for a while?

00:10.560 --> 00:11.350
Yes.

00:11.360 --> 00:15.350
I would like to make Bassam
Special Counsel to the President.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.064
My name's Sammy, by the way.

00:17.065 --> 00:18.060
Abdul.

00:18.095 --> 00:19.830
And I thought
maybe we could hang out?

00:19.865 --> 00:23.200
I'd be disappointed if we didn't.

00:23.235 --> 00:24.670
Ahmed.

00:24.705 --> 00:25.800
Stop.

00:25.835 --> 00:27.040
Please.

00:27.075 --> 00:29.040
What the hell were
you doing with those men?

00:29.075 --> 00:29.840
Ihab Rashid?

00:29.875 --> 00:31.570
I was trying to make a difference.

00:31.580 --> 00:34.010
Something you
wouldn't understand.

00:34.045 --> 00:37.210
We have captured Ihab
Rashid and ten of his followers.

00:37.220 --> 00:41.080
Well, I'm not sure if it matters to
you, but you're about to execute the wrong man.

00:41.090 --> 00:43.020
What would
you have me do?

00:43.055 --> 00:46.220
Open the jails and
set everyone free?

00:46.255 --> 00:47.590
Yeah.

00:47.625 --> 00:50.230
It's done, brother.

The doctor suggested...

04:10.265 --> 04:13.530
That's
talking about it.

04:17.870 --> 04:20.440
We could try
again, that's all.

04:20.475 --> 04:27.370

will feel worse. Change the subject.

04:41.130 --> 04:42.830

04:42.865 --> 04:46.630
Yeah, I

It's, um...
It's the 23rd.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.440
I know.

04:58.475 --> 05:02.510
One anniversary
that I'd like to forget.

05:18.330 --> 05:20.930
I saw you praying.

05:23.530 --> 05:25.340
Is that a problem?

05:25.375 --> 05:28.670
Oh, not as long
as you're praying for a job.

05:28.705 --> 05:30.670
I'm tired of just bread.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.180
Bread
is what we have.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.130
Where are you going?

05:49.165 --> 05:53.000
To see a man.

05:53.035 --> 05:55.400
About a job?

05:55.435 --> 05:57.770
Yes.

06:02.910 --> 06:06.910
Soon, you will have more
than bread for breakfast.

06:06.945 --> 06:16.350
You will have all the fruit... and
cheese... and eggs you can eat.

06:16.385 --> 06:18.620
I promise.

06:27.435 --> 06:30.930
Good-bye, my love.

06:30.940 --> 06:35.470
Return with work.
You'll have kisses then.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.620
Bye, Papa.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.290
Eat.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.260
Plus, honey, it
happened 20 years ago.

07:01.270 --> 07:02.430
What happened?

07:02.465 --> 07:05.970
Uh... Your father wants
Uncle Jamal to acknowledge

07:06.005 --> 07:08.240
the anniversary of the
gas attack in Ma'an.

07:08.275 --> 07:11.610
Yeah, that's the least you can do,
considering 20,000 people were killed.

07:11.645 --> 07:13.210
Yeah. Who
were trying to kill us.

07:13.245 --> 07:15.210
Acknowledging the past
is one thing, but why invite the

07:15.245 --> 07:16.810
comparison between
your father and Jamal?

07:16.820 --> 07:18.580
Well,
that's the point.

07:18.615 --> 07:19.980
As an Al Fayeed and
as president...

07:20.015 --> 07:20.780
Unelected.

07:20.790 --> 07:23.450
He can't avoid the
comparison, sitting in that chair.

07:23.460 --> 07:24.290
Don't you mean throne?

07:24.325 --> 07:26.090
Geez, what's your
problem with us being royalty?

07:26.125 --> 07:28.620
Sammy, this isn't a monarchy.
You are not royalty.

07:28.630 --> 07:31.420
Right. We're just
grandchildren of a war criminal.

07:31.430 --> 07:34.000
Emma!

07:34.035 --> 07:38.700
Reema, do people still
talk about what happened in Ma'an?

07:42.470 --> 07:43.810
Not really.

07:43.845 --> 07:46.010
Everyone knows
what happened, right?

07:46.045 --> 07:48.080
Guys, don't
put her on the spot.

07:48.115 --> 07:51.880
You're making her uncomfortable.
I'm sorry, Reema.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.530
We will eat
when it's time for lunch.

08:06.565 --> 08:08.660
But I am hungry.

08:08.670 --> 08:14.900
Maybe next time your mother tells
you to come for breakfast, you will come.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.650
Never forget, Ma'an!

08:29.685 --> 08:36.730
Never forget the Al Fayeed's
crime against humanity!

08:36.765 --> 08:40.700
Like father, like son!

08:40.735 --> 08:43.700
Never forget Ma'an!

08:43.735 --> 08:47.570
Never forget!

08:48.710 --> 08:52.380
Down with the tyrant!

08:54.710 --> 08:57.080
Like father, like son!

08:57.115 --> 08:59.880
Down with the tyrant!

08:59.915 --> 09:02.590
Never forget Ma'an!

09:02.625 --> 09:06.160
Never forget!

09:46.395 --> 09:48.760
Put that down.
Put it down!

09:48.770 --> 09:51.800
Do you know what I went
through to get you this job?

09:51.835 --> 09:55.240
You will lose it, or worse.
That has nothing to do with us.

09:55.275 --> 09:58.640
Do your work. Do your work!

12:15.910 --> 12:18.180
Thank you, sister.

12:25.090 --> 12:30.290
Your husband was a
great hero of the resistance.

12:32.795 --> 12:36.900
Don't speak as if you knew him!

12:36.935 --> 12:40.970
You will have...
glorious martyr's funeral.

12:41.005 --> 12:46.780
Please... just leave.

12:46.815 --> 12:51.380
I want to be
great hero like my father.

12:54.320 --> 12:58.390
Leave here.
Leave us be.

12:58.425 --> 13:01.560
I do not pretend to
have known Kazim very well.

13:01.595 --> 13:06.000
But I know how hard he worked
to provide for his family.

13:06.035 --> 13:10.770
Until the Al Fayeeds replaced
him with one of their cronies.

13:10.805 --> 13:17.010
But you will see, their time is coming
to an end sooner than you think, and...

13:17.045 --> 13:19.610
your husband...

13:19.645 --> 13:23.780
your husband's courageous act
will be remembered as the first

13:23.815 --> 13:29.420
great act of defiance
in our liberation.

13:29.455 --> 13:34.790
Peace be on you and
your children.

14:05.690 --> 14:08.820
But you will
see, their time is coming to an

14:08.830 --> 14:12.030
end sooner than
you think, and...

14:12.065 --> 14:15.830
So Ihab Rashid is behind all this.

14:15.865 --> 14:18.140
A man I
had in custody.

14:18.175 --> 14:19.540
For something
he hadn't done.

14:19.575 --> 14:20.240
Immaterial.

14:20.275 --> 14:23.470
He's an enemy of the state.
Condemned by his own words.

14:23.505 --> 14:28.310
Mr. President, it's clear to me
that we need to clear the square.

14:28.345 --> 14:31.220
- It's a peaceful protest.
- It is an unlawful gathering.

14:31.255 --> 14:32.920
Is there such a thing
here as a lawful gathering?

14:32.955 --> 14:35.920
Your brother is now
a constitutional advisor?

14:35.955 --> 14:36.690
Let him speak.

14:36.725 --> 14:37.690
He has nothing to say.

14:37.725 --> 14:38.690
General.

14:38.725 --> 14:41.890
Peaceful demonstration
is a basic human right.

14:41.925 --> 14:45.260
I'm just trying to imagine what
storm troopers hauling away

14:45.295 --> 14:48.490
nonviolent protestors is gonna look
like when it goes viral on YouTube.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.830
Bassam, what
do you suggest I do?

14:51.840 --> 14:53.940
Go down to the square.

14:53.975 --> 14:58.340
Make a statement acknowledging
our father's regrettable act.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.440
Regretted by who?

14:59.475 --> 15:00.940
It was a war crime.

15:00.975 --> 15:04.510
I don't recall seeing Harry Truman
in irons after Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

15:04.670 --> 15:09.740
This, uh, so-called, uh,
Ma'an Massacre brought peace

15:09.775 --> 15:12.240
after four years of civil war.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.770
I was proud to carry
out your father's order and

15:14.780 --> 15:20.370
would again without hesitation. Protests like
these need to be strangled in their crib.

15:20.380 --> 15:23.210
Ihab Rashid is trying
to claim the moral high ground

15:23.220 --> 15:26.750
by tying you to our father's
crime, but don't let him.

15:26.785 --> 15:29.590
Go to the square and show the
people that you respect their

15:29.625 --> 15:35.190
rights, that you'll rule differently...
That's what this is really about.

15:41.730 --> 15:48.240
Colonel, secure a place for
me in the square to address the people.

15:48.275 --> 15:49.370
Mr. President...

15:49.380 --> 15:54.750
My brother is right. I
am the true voice of Abbudin,

15:54.785 --> 15:58.250
not this terrorist
pretender Ihab Rashid.

15:58.285 --> 16:04.690
Our people will thrill to
their president's words.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.620
This is Abdul Naqvi.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.890
Leave your name and number
and I'll call you back.

16:37.925 --> 16:39.960
Hey, Abdul,
it's, uh, Sammy.

16:39.995 --> 16:42.190
Did, um... did I miss something?

16:42.225 --> 16:45.150
How... How come you're
not calling me back?

16:45.185 --> 16:46.920
Cousin.

16:46.955 --> 16:48.090
Hey.

16:48.125 --> 16:50.730
This is
my trainer Anna.

16:50.765 --> 16:51.890
Hi.

16:51.900 --> 16:55.900
Grandfather brought her over from East
Germany, back when there was an East Germany.

16:55.935 --> 16:58.930
She took bronze in the
decathlon in the '88 Olympics.

16:58.940 --> 17:01.600
Impressive.
Congratulations.

17:01.610 --> 17:03.610
I'm the one
who deserves a medal.

17:03.645 --> 17:05.940
Dropping 20 pounds
for my wedding.

17:05.974 --> 17:07.940
Go on, Anna.

17:07.974 --> 17:10.180
I'll meet you in the gym.

17:14.150 --> 17:19.619
So, cousin, Nusrat's been a
little, um, under the weather.

17:19.655 --> 17:21.960
I've been trying
to cheer her up.

17:21.994 --> 17:25.130
Anyway, I told her I wanted to take her
to the club tonight with some friends.

17:25.165 --> 17:27.130
She didn't want to go.

17:27.165 --> 17:30.630
But I told her that you
and Emma were coming.

17:32.005 --> 17:36.830
Um... I'll ask Emma, but I'm
not really up for going out tonight.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.940
Trust me,
you'll want to be there.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.610
The Nasr twins are
flying in from Kuwait.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.340
The, um, Nasr twins?

17:43.350 --> 17:44.950
Sabina and Nashina.

17:45.985 --> 17:49.350
I made out with one once,
but, uh, I never knew which.

17:50.485 --> 17:52.790
With them, every day
is spring break.

17:52.825 --> 17:55.360
You and Abdul can each have one.

17:55.395 --> 17:57.030
Abdul's going?

17:57.065 --> 17:58.990
Abdul goes where I go.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.830
Come. Bring Emma.

18:00.865 --> 18:04.730
We will show you how
we party in Abbudin.

18:38.470 --> 18:41.040
I've been worried
sick trying to find you.

18:41.075 --> 18:43.500
You don't answer my
calls, not my e-mails.

18:43.510 --> 18:44.510
Where have you been?

18:44.545 --> 18:46.670
Where I belong.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.480
Samira, you belong
home and safe with me.

18:49.515 --> 18:51.010
So I can serve tea?

18:51.045 --> 18:54.020
While you write blog
posts that no one reads?

18:54.055 --> 18:56.050
I'm done wishing for change.

18:56.085 --> 18:58.050
I'm making it happen.

18:58.085 --> 19:01.850
They put you in prison once already
because of your association with Ihab Rashid.

19:01.860 --> 19:05.220
And I'll go back again, if
that's what it takes to win our freedom.

19:05.230 --> 19:09.530
How can you say that? You know what
they're capable of, what they did to me.

19:09.565 --> 19:13.530
Why do you think
they tolerate you now?

19:13.540 --> 19:17.110
Because you don't threaten them.
Not like this.

19:17.145 --> 19:19.110
Samira,
come home with me.

19:19.145 --> 19:22.010
- Come... Come... Please.
- No.

19:22.045 --> 19:23.110
I'm asking you
to come home with me.

19:23.145 --> 19:24.110
No, I'm not...

19:24.145 --> 19:26.110
Samira,
I'm begging you.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.780
Hey. Hey.
Leave the sister be.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.320
I'm her father.

19:29.355 --> 19:31.120
Then you
should be happy.

19:31.155 --> 19:37.090
- She has found the righteous path.
- It's okay. We are okay.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.760
"Righteous path"?

19:39.795 --> 19:43.360
They just want you to trade one
form of subjugation for another.

19:43.370 --> 19:44.900
I'm not naive, Father.

19:44.935 --> 19:48.100
I know that Ihab's way isn't
perfect, but he says the

19:48.135 --> 19:50.140
Brotherhood will change
once they're in power.

19:50.175 --> 19:51.540
And you believe him?

19:51.575 --> 19:53.940
I'm willing
to give him a chance.

19:53.975 --> 19:57.950
And I wish you'd
give me a chance.

19:57.985 --> 20:00.780
Stay with me.

20:10.130 --> 20:12.090
From students to
Islamists to members of the

20:12.100 --> 20:15.000
Labor Party, the protestors
represent many different

20:15.035 --> 20:18.570
constituencies, but all are
united in their frustration at

20:18.605 --> 20:22.600
the dynastic succession that has
installed Jamal Al Fayeed, the

20:22.610 --> 20:25.610
son of the so-called Butcher
of Abbudin, as president.

20:28.950 --> 20:31.950
Hey, Reema, uh, what
are they saying about Jamal?

20:31.985 --> 20:33.080
Please
don't tell them.

20:33.115 --> 20:34.950
I swear, I won't do it again.

20:34.985 --> 20:37.150
It's okay, Reema.
You can have the TV on.

20:37.185 --> 20:37.950
It's not permitted.

20:37.985 --> 20:41.760
- Honestly, I don't mind.
- It's against the law.

20:41.795 --> 20:44.430
Against the law?

20:44.465 --> 20:48.600
We can only watch
what they allow us to watch.

20:48.635 --> 20:54.170
They can't arrest
you for watching the news.

20:54.205 --> 21:01.010
So this morning when you said no one talks about
Ma'an, it's not because they've forgotten.

21:01.045 --> 21:03.180
It's because they're
afraid to say anything.

21:03.215 --> 21:07.620
Please, ma'am,
I already say too much.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.400
"This day is a chance
for me to ask the people's

21:20.435 --> 21:24.030
forgiveness for a dark moment
in our nation's history..."

21:24.065 --> 21:26.170
Why would you
apologize for something your

21:26.205 --> 21:29.870
father did when you weren't even
old enough to grow a beard?

21:29.970 --> 21:34.040
Because my brother the diplomat
thinks it is what the people want to hear.

21:34.075 --> 21:38.210
The reason people are following Ihab
Rashid is because he's given them a voice.

21:38.245 --> 21:40.650
How else can we expect
them to follow you?

21:40.685 --> 21:43.250
Your tongue is your horse.

21:43.285 --> 21:46.650
If you let it loose,
it will betray you.

21:50.030 --> 21:55.200
And that is what the
Al Fayeeds want you to think.

21:55.235 --> 22:00.800
But we... we think for
ourselves, and all we have to do

22:00.835 --> 22:07.510
is look and we see the security
forces making it safe for Jamal

22:07.545 --> 22:12.250
Al Fayeed coming to greet
you like a pharaoh.

22:12.285 --> 22:16.280
Me? I'm here as a man
and a servant of Allah.

22:16.290 --> 22:18.090
Did anyone appoint me?

22:18.125 --> 22:21.720
- No!
- No!

22:21.755 --> 22:28.430
Did I take this country of my birth,
of my father's birth, by bloody hand?

22:28.465 --> 22:32.530
- No!
- No!

22:32.540 --> 22:36.540
Who here lost someone
20 years ago in Ma'an?

22:42.480 --> 22:45.050
I, too, lost someone.

22:45.085 --> 22:47.320
My mother.

22:47.355 --> 22:53.720
I saw the blood spill from
her eyes, from her mouth.

22:53.755 --> 23:02.660
My father exiled, his scarred lungs
the only reminder of-of his home.

23:02.670 --> 23:10.910
Now these Al Fayeeds, they want to
give us platitudes instead of work!

23:10.945 --> 23:13.340
Instead of food!

23:13.375 --> 23:19.150
Men and women of Abbudin, we
have asked for so little, and

23:19.185 --> 23:24.690
that is exactly is what we have
gotten, but, inshallah, today,

23:24.725 --> 23:26.350
we are no longer asking.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.090
No, no, no, my
brothers and sisters.

23:28.125 --> 23:35.500
Today we're here to tell the Al
Fayeeds that their day is done!

23:35.535 --> 23:38.130
Their day is done!

23:38.165 --> 23:42.500
Their day is done!

23:46.180 --> 23:49.180
- Over there!
- It's the Al Fayeeds!

23:51.015 --> 23:52.210
The Al Fayeeds!

23:55.185 --> 23:56.380
Hey! Hey!

23:56.390 --> 23:57.990
Run them down!

24:00.025 --> 24:01.220
Run them down!

24:01.255 --> 24:02.320
Go!

24:03.530 --> 24:04.730
Go!

24:09.265 --> 24:13.400
Tomorrow, there will
be only pigeons in the square.

24:13.435 --> 24:15.540
Their day is done!

24:15.575 --> 24:16.600
Their day is done!

24:45.000 --> 24:47.170
Good to see you, as always, Ahmed.

24:47.205 --> 24:49.400
- Yeah, my man.
- There they are.

24:49.435 --> 24:50.510
Nashina, Sabrina.

24:51.635 --> 24:53.900
Meet my American
cousins, Sammy and Emma.

24:53.935 --> 24:54.980
Hey darling.
You look gorgeus.

24:58.535 --> 25:00.940
You were right.
Your cousin is so cute.

25:01.780 --> 25:05.120
Yeah,
yeah, I told you.

25:08.210 --> 25:10.540
Allison, my
favorite waitress.

25:10.690 --> 25:11.890
My favorite prince.

25:11.900 --> 25:13.130
Mmm.

25:13.165 --> 25:16.770
Why bother with the glass when
it already comes in a bottle?

25:20.540 --> 25:23.010
I left you,
like, a dozen messages.

25:23.045 --> 25:25.210
Yes, you
should stop doing that.

25:25.245 --> 25:28.810
What the hell? You're just
gonna blow me and then blow me off?

25:28.845 --> 25:30.510
We hooked up.
It was one night.

25:30.545 --> 25:31.510
You don't do that in America?

25:31.520 --> 25:32.720
Okay, that's
not what it was.

25:32.755 --> 25:35.980
I know the difference between...

25:35.990 --> 25:37.220
Hey.

25:37.255 --> 25:38.550
Ah.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.790
Come, let's sit.

25:44.390 --> 25:47.390
Oh, champagne...

25:53.770 --> 25:55.570
Yes...

25:57.605 --> 25:58.570
That's good, baby.

25:59.815 --> 26:02.610
Yes...

26:05.085 --> 26:07.180
Come on, big boy.

26:07.215 --> 26:09.620
Come on.

26:12.225 --> 26:14.190
Oh, yeah.

26:14.225 --> 26:15.420
Jamal?

26:16.465 --> 26:17.760
What?

26:17.795 --> 26:20.060
What?!

26:20.095 --> 26:23.470
I'm... about to shower.

26:27.240 --> 26:29.770
John Tucker is
on the way over here.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.410
I picked up a suit for you.

26:31.445 --> 26:32.610
Why is Tucker coming?

26:32.645 --> 26:34.810
Because
I asked him to.

26:34.845 --> 26:38.610
Tomorrow, after you clear the square,
you will need the Americans.

26:40.915 --> 26:43.290
Need the Americans.

26:43.325 --> 26:45.090
Need them for what?

26:45.125 --> 26:48.790
Political cover from the U.N.
and the E.U. and all

26:48.825 --> 26:51.790
those absurd human rights
watch dogs who love to bark.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.970
You really think the
Americans will stand with us?

26:55.005 --> 27:00.640
If they want to keep their
base on our lands, they'd better.

27:00.675 --> 27:06.240
Clearing the square.
It all sounds so antiseptic.

27:06.275 --> 27:09.010
People will die.

27:09.045 --> 27:12.680
And those who don't
will understand how strong you

27:12.715 --> 27:19.020
are, and they will teach that lesson
when they return to their homes.

27:19.055 --> 27:22.690
Now put your suit on.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.640
Fauzi?
It's Bassam.

27:34.675 --> 27:35.840
Bassam?

27:35.875 --> 27:38.540
Listen, I need to talk to you.

27:38.575 --> 27:40.880
It's... It's...
It's really hard to hear.

27:40.915 --> 27:42.680
I said, I
need to talk to you.

27:42.715 --> 27:44.710
Oh, I'm-I'm listening.

27:44.720 --> 27:47.820
No, not on the phone,
and, uh, it's probably not a

27:47.855 --> 27:50.050
good idea for me to
come to the plaza.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.850
There is a cafe
nearby called Yahala.

27:52.860 --> 27:56.190
Okay. I'll
be there in an hour.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.380
You're good.

28:16.415 --> 28:17.710
What?

28:17.745 --> 28:21.380
You dance
better than most guys.

28:21.390 --> 28:23.550
You have a girlfriend back home?

28:23.585 --> 28:27.160
Ah... no.

28:35.900 --> 28:39.900
Of course, the 918 is quick,
but the McLaren is insane.

28:39.935 --> 28:40.900
I bought two.

28:40.935 --> 28:42.410
Why do you need two?

28:42.445 --> 28:43.410
Why do I need one?

28:43.445 --> 28:44.470
Because I can.

28:44.505 --> 28:45.990
You have a problem with that?

28:46.025 --> 28:46.710
Ahmed.

28:46.745 --> 28:47.910
What?

28:47.945 --> 28:49.110
Don't be rude to her.

28:49.145 --> 28:51.080
I'm asking
her a question.

28:51.115 --> 28:52.980
People could just
take it the wrong way.

28:53.015 --> 28:54.080
What people?

28:54.115 --> 28:55.080
I don't know.

28:55.090 --> 28:57.090
People that are hungry,
people in the plaza.

28:57.125 --> 29:00.090
In case you haven't noticed, it's all
over Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter.

29:00.125 --> 29:02.090
What do I care
about those people?

29:02.125 --> 29:05.490
They don't even know
what a McLaren is.

29:05.500 --> 29:09.030
A man who hasn't worked in almost a year lights himself on fire,

29:09.065 --> 29:10.030
and you're laughing about it?

29:10.065 --> 29:11.730
Lighten
up, little cousin.

29:11.740 --> 29:13.740
You're not being
very fun right now.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.420
I want to dance.

29:15.455 --> 29:16.420
What do you think, baby?

29:16.455 --> 29:17.350
You want to dance?

29:17.385 --> 29:19.420
Uh, no,
I don't think so.

29:19.455 --> 29:20.420
Yeah, you do. Come on.

29:20.455 --> 29:23.420
Uh, I'm going to
go for a cigarette with Emma.

29:23.430 --> 29:25.960
It's okay.
I don't smoke.

29:25.995 --> 29:27.960
You can
start tonight.

29:27.995 --> 29:30.030
Come on.

29:40.415 --> 29:42.980
What are
you looking at?

29:43.015 --> 29:44.180
Nothing.

29:44.215 --> 29:46.010
Get me another one.

29:46.020 --> 29:48.020
Why don't
you take a break?

29:48.055 --> 29:51.090
Why don't you
get me another one?

30:10.815 --> 30:14.350
Mr. President.

30:14.385 --> 30:15.720
Mr. Special Envoy.

30:15.755 --> 30:18.520
Thank you for coming
at such a late hour.

30:18.555 --> 30:21.590
I heard about your,
uh, aborted trip to the plaza.

30:21.625 --> 30:23.790
That sounds... harrowing.

30:23.825 --> 30:28.560
We are sending in
forces at dawn to restore order.

30:28.570 --> 30:34.800
The U.S., of course, will issue a statement
condemning our excessive use of force.

30:34.810 --> 30:37.570
How excessive?

30:37.605 --> 30:41.940
Well... it
will be what it will be.

30:41.950 --> 30:43.140
Oh?

30:43.150 --> 30:48.750
Now, despite
Washington's pro forma protest,

30:48.785 --> 30:52.420
I assume we'll have
no real problem?

30:52.455 --> 30:53.660
Up to a point.

30:53.695 --> 30:54.760
Up to a point?

30:54.795 --> 30:57.630
What is your over and under?

30:57.665 --> 30:58.960
50 dead?

30:58.995 --> 31:00.160
500?

31:00.195 --> 31:03.400
<i>The wrong one
 could be problematic.</i>

31:03.435 --> 31:07.070
Shoot an attractive college coed
in the head, all bets are off.

31:07.105 --> 31:14.540
Mm. This coed against
your key regional naval base?

31:18.650 --> 31:20.380
Thank you for your time.

31:20.415 --> 31:23.490
Thank you, Mr.
President.

31:23.790 --> 31:26.690
Now, one thing you might
want to bear in mind.

31:26.725 --> 31:32.930
Uh, our naval base lease is with your
nation, not your family personally, right?

31:32.965 --> 31:35.430
We keep Guantanamo, but
Castro hates our guts.

31:35.465 --> 31:36.830
Meaning what?

31:36.865 --> 31:40.500
Meaning, like all
things, patience is finite.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.600
It's not just your sister.

31:51.635 --> 31:54.600
All you Americans think everyone has the
right to everything whenever they want.

31:54.635 --> 31:55.600
Am I right?

31:55.635 --> 31:56.990
But look around.

31:57.025 --> 31:59.400
There's only so much
room in the VIP section.

31:59.435 --> 32:01.410
Shit!

32:01.445 --> 32:03.410
What are you doing, walking
into me like that?

32:03.445 --> 32:05.410
I'll get some napkins.
I'm sorry.

32:05.445 --> 32:08.010
Napkins? I'm drenched
in Cristal up to my ass.

32:08.045 --> 32:08.980
I'll take
care of it, okay?

32:09.015 --> 32:10.980
Cousin, Cousin, it
was an accident, all right?

32:11.015 --> 32:13.250
No. Accidents
are unexpected.

32:13.285 --> 32:16.250
This asshole told me I've had enough,
and then sprays shit everywhere.

32:16.260 --> 32:16.750
Ahmed.

32:16.785 --> 32:17.460
Dude, come on!

32:17.495 --> 32:19.260
Take off your pants.

32:19.295 --> 32:20.260
What?

32:20.295 --> 32:22.260
No, no, no, no, I'm
not walking out of here looking

32:22.295 --> 32:24.430
like I pissed myself 'cause
he can't hold his champagne.

32:24.465 --> 32:26.030
Ahmed, Ahmed, you're
shitfaced, and you need to back off.

32:26.065 --> 32:29.030
- Abdul didn't do anything, all all right?
- It's my fault, okay? Your cousin is right.

32:29.065 --> 32:34.310
I'm out of here.
Where the hell is my wife?

32:45.820 --> 32:48.690
I'm a little worried about the kids.

32:48.725 --> 32:49.920
They're still out.

32:49.955 --> 32:52.220
I didn't want them to
go either, but we can't keep

32:52.255 --> 32:54.430
them locked up in the palace.

32:54.465 --> 32:56.460
Where are you going?

32:56.495 --> 32:58.030
Fauzi's
blogging from the square.

32:58.065 --> 32:59.200
He's with his daughter.

32:59.235 --> 33:04.000
I need to get down there
and, uh, warn them before...

33:04.035 --> 33:06.440
Before what?

33:06.475 --> 33:10.470
Jamal's authorized
Tariq to go in tomorrow morning.

33:10.480 --> 33:14.650
He's sending in his
storm troopers.

33:14.685 --> 33:18.580
Barry? It's
not safe for you to be

33:18.615 --> 33:20.030
there, especially after
what happened today.

33:20.065 --> 33:21.850
It's not safe
for anyone there, okay?

33:21.885 --> 33:23.090
There's no such thing as safety.

33:23.125 --> 33:24.720
If I didn't know it
yesterday, I know it today.

33:24.755 --> 33:27.860
Hey, I'm
not the enemy, okay?

33:27.895 --> 33:29.290
I'm on your side.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.490
Well, don't be, okay?

33:30.500 --> 33:35.370
'Cause my side doesn't have a clue
what it's supposed to be doing.

33:35.405 --> 33:37.340
I let the guy out.

33:37.375 --> 33:40.470
I pushed Jamal to release
him, because I thought...

33:40.505 --> 33:41.940
I don't know what I thought.

33:41.975 --> 33:46.110
I... I didn't want my brother to be
like my father, so... so let's not

33:46.145 --> 33:48.000
make the same mistake
as our parents.

33:48.035 --> 33:49.980
Let's make a partner
out of Ihab Rashid.

33:50.015 --> 33:51.250
Let's make peace.

33:51.285 --> 33:53.590
What's happening in the plaza
tomorrow... that's my doing.

33:53.625 --> 33:58.160
- I made that possible.
- Really?

33:58.195 --> 34:00.020
Okay.

34:00.055 --> 34:05.200
Reema, my maid... shy little Reema...
you know why she's so quiet?

34:05.235 --> 34:06.960
She told me today.

34:06.970 --> 34:11.070
Because she and everyone else in this country
have been living in fear for 20 years.

34:11.105 --> 34:14.210
Afraid to... to think,
to read, to speak.

34:14.245 --> 34:15.969
And now they've had enough.

34:16.005 --> 34:18.510
You didn't make Ihab Rashid.

34:18.545 --> 34:19.210
Your father did.

34:19.245 --> 34:20.949
You let him out of jail because

34:20.985 --> 34:23.150
turning him into a martyr
for a crime he didn't commit

34:23.185 --> 34:25.150
would have made things worse.

34:25.350 --> 34:28.949
I don't know. Ihab's
just as ruthless as Tariq is.

34:28.985 --> 34:30.290
Is that
really a surprise?

34:30.324 --> 34:33.989
I... I don't think you can
subjugate a people for 20 years

34:34.025 --> 34:36.590
and expect Nelson Mandela to
walk out of prison every time.

34:36.625 --> 34:40.330
Barry, it took almost a century to
make peace in Northern Ireland.

34:40.364 --> 34:42.030
No one's done it yet
in Kashmir or Israel.

34:42.065 --> 34:44.239
What do you think you're gonna
do, show up like some kind of

34:44.275 --> 34:48.239
movie hero and wrap things
up in a long weekend?

34:48.275 --> 34:50.239
Everyone here is scared.

34:50.275 --> 34:52.780
Everyone is broken.

34:52.815 --> 35:00.120
If you can get any one of them to come even
an inch closer to trust, that's a win.

35:06.430 --> 35:10.030
Are you gonna be okay?

35:11.600 --> 35:15.130
Yeah. Yeah.

35:41.830 --> 35:43.830
I'm still hungry.

35:43.865 --> 35:46.460
Gonna see if I can
get something.

35:46.470 --> 35:48.530
Okay.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.280
Listen...

35:59.315 --> 36:00.280
I'm sorry.

36:00.315 --> 36:02.310
What the
hell's wrong with you?

36:02.320 --> 36:05.380
I don't understand anything
that you're doing.

36:10.060 --> 36:14.460
Look, my grandfather was not
head of security, neither is my father.

36:14.495 --> 36:16.030
He's a security guard.

36:16.065 --> 36:18.230
Nobody.

36:18.265 --> 36:19.830
Okay.

36:19.865 --> 36:20.830
I don't give a shit.

36:20.865 --> 36:22.830
Because
you are not me.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.470
I get invited here, and to the
parties and the VIP rooms,

36:25.505 --> 36:27.470
because people like
the way I look.

36:27.505 --> 36:29.470
The way I talk, the
way I dress up.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.340
But if Ahmed or anyone would find out,

36:31.375 --> 36:33.150
doors would close like that.

36:33.185 --> 36:35.310
I'm here at their pleasure.Ã¹

36:35.320 --> 36:38.750
That's why Ahmed can treat
me however he wants.

36:42.090 --> 36:45.860
And why... you and I...

36:45.895 --> 36:46.860
You're afraid.

36:46.895 --> 36:48.860
I'm not afraid.

36:48.895 --> 36:50.530
I'm ambitious.

36:50.565 --> 36:52.300
Rules don't apply
to your family.

36:52.335 --> 36:56.940
If you get caught, you
can always go home.

36:56.975 --> 37:00.140
Me, I have nowhere else to go.

37:08.280 --> 37:11.720
So why didn't you
just ignore me when I met you?

37:11.755 --> 37:13.180
What was the point?

37:13.190 --> 37:14.190
Why did you and I...

37:14.225 --> 37:18.920
Because you were only
visiting, and I took the chance.

37:18.930 --> 37:20.760
I'm sorry you got hurt.

37:34.740 --> 37:39.540
I ordered
you espresso.

37:39.550 --> 37:42.550
So what's so important you
couldn't tell me over the phone?

37:42.585 --> 37:44.950
I didn't
want them to hear.

37:44.985 --> 37:46.950
Who?

37:46.985 --> 37:53.220
Tariq, Ziad, whoever it is I'm
sure is listening to my phone calls.

37:53.230 --> 37:58.600
They're sending forces in at dawn,
with orders to clear the plaza.

37:58.635 --> 37:59.630
And?

37:59.665 --> 38:02.570
You and Samira
shouldn't be there.

38:02.605 --> 38:04.540
You came all the way
here to tell me what people

38:04.575 --> 38:06.570
have been expecting
since this all began?

38:07.605 --> 38:08.390
You're not hearing me.

38:08.425 --> 38:11.130
I'm committing a possibly
treasonous breach of security

38:11.165 --> 38:13.780
to warn my friend
to get out of harm's way.

38:13.815 --> 38:14.980
People are gonna die tomorrow.

38:15.015 --> 38:16.180
Go to hell, Bassam.

38:17.215 --> 38:19.180
Where's
that coming from?

38:19.190 --> 38:22.180
You're telling me to leave the
plaza when that's where you should be.

38:22.190 --> 38:23.190
Yeah, I tried.

38:23.225 --> 38:25.590
Your freedom lovers
tried to lynch me.

38:25.625 --> 38:29.860
You... You came there in a government
limo... flanked by palace security,

38:29.895 --> 38:31.960
instead of walking in as
a citizen of Abbudin.

38:31.970 --> 38:32.960
As a man.

38:32.970 --> 38:34.670
To do what?

38:34.705 --> 38:36.970
Tell me... what... what is
it you want me to do?

38:37.005 --> 38:38.970
I want you to
get your hands dirty.

38:39.005 --> 38:40.370
To go against your family.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.370
Oh, and... and
get behind Ihab?

38:42.380 --> 38:44.640
'Cause I'm pretty sure
he's not the answer.

38:44.675 --> 38:47.880
Bassam, I have
no illusions about Ihab.

38:47.915 --> 38:50.500
One thing he does understand,
though, is that the people

38:50.535 --> 38:53.290
are done being told
how to live their lives.

38:53.325 --> 38:56.890
My daughter, all she really wants
is... is the freedom to speak

38:56.925 --> 38:59.460
her mind, to read what
she wants to read.

38:59.495 --> 39:01.760
All she wants is
to have a say in her own future.

39:01.795 --> 39:03.660
To be heard, to be listened to.

39:03.695 --> 39:05.060
She's
risking her life.

39:05.070 --> 39:08.070
Well, she's willing
to take that chance.

39:08.105 --> 39:11.200
And you're
okay with that?

39:11.235 --> 39:16.540
Whatever happens, Bassam,
I will be standing next to her.

39:20.410 --> 39:24.480
Fauzi. Wait.

39:29.155 --> 39:31.490
How was the club?

39:31.525 --> 39:33.460
Glad you're home.

39:33.495 --> 39:37.030
Me, too.

39:37.065 --> 39:38.530
Did something happen?

39:38.565 --> 39:40.470
No.

39:40.505 --> 39:44.140
That doesn't
sound very convincing.

39:44.175 --> 39:46.470
Tell me what happened.

39:46.505 --> 39:49.340
It's nothing.

39:49.375 --> 39:55.710
Baby... tell me.

39:55.720 --> 39:59.550
Mom, I just
want to go home.

39:59.585 --> 40:02.850
Sweetheart, it's okay.

40:02.860 --> 40:04.890
No, it's not.

40:04.925 --> 40:08.860
There's something seriously,
seriously wrong with this place.

40:08.895 --> 40:10.930
Come here, come here.

40:17.570 --> 40:20.510
We'll be ready to move at dawn.

40:20.545 --> 40:22.770
The initial stage?

40:24.740 --> 40:30.140
The usual. Tear gas,
rubber bullets, water cannons.

40:32.920 --> 40:39.960
And if that
proves insufficient?

40:39.995 --> 40:41.960
Live ammunition.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.570
A bloodbath.

40:48.605 --> 40:53.130
It usually doesn't take that
many corpses to discourage idealists.

40:54.375 --> 40:58.770
There would have been less blood if we
had done this when I first suggested.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.190
Mr. President?

41:11.790 --> 41:14.330
General, I
need to call you back.

41:14.365 --> 41:16.390
Mr. President.

41:18.330 --> 41:21.330
Why did you send me this?

41:21.365 --> 41:23.330
To show
you your future.

41:23.340 --> 41:27.570
'Cause you're gonna get what Qaddafi
got if you send Tariq into the square.

41:27.605 --> 41:31.840
And you know before these animals
put a bullet in Qaddafi's brain,

41:31.875 --> 41:36.450
they sodomized him with a bayonet.

41:36.485 --> 41:40.990
I will kill 50, 100,000 before
I let them do that to me.

41:41.025 --> 41:43.980
You know why that
happened to him and not our father?

41:43.990 --> 41:47.790
Because 20 years later, the world
won't look the other way anymore.

41:47.825 --> 41:49.990
Your friends, the
Americans, won't.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
Qaddafi was on his way to commit mass
slaughter in Benghazi when NATO intervened.

41:55.035 --> 41:58.600
Look, even if Tariq clears the
plaza today, twice as many

41:58.610 --> 42:02.870
people will come back, and they will keep
coming back until they're outside the palace.

42:02.880 --> 42:05.010
Maybe not tomorrow or next
week, but it will happen.

42:05.045 --> 42:07.010
And sooner than you think.

42:07.045 --> 42:11.820
So, I'm not saying don't use
violence because it's wrong, I'm

42:11.855 --> 42:14.620
saying don't use violence
because it doesn't work.

42:14.655 --> 42:19.190
Tell me what
will work, not what won't.

42:19.225 --> 42:24.190
I asked Fauzi Nidal to
set up a meeting with Ihab Rashid.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.300
The man who
would have all our heads?

42:26.335 --> 42:28.300
He's willing to meet me.

42:28.335 --> 42:31.000
Let me go and see him and
find out what he wants.

42:31.035 --> 42:33.910
Maybe it's things we can agree
to a new constitution or a

42:33.945 --> 42:40.640
more transparent economy. Things that
maybe aren't worth massacring people over.

42:40.650 --> 42:44.220
The people are willing to die
to be heard, so unless you're

42:44.255 --> 42:49.550
prepared to kill every last one of them...
This is the only way.

43:11.280 --> 43:17.680
You can go down in history
as one more brutal dictator.

43:17.715 --> 43:20.020
Or you can be remembered as the leader

43:20.055 --> 43:26.760
who had the courage
to listen to his people.

43:26.795 --> 43:31.730
Who do you want to be?

43:40.690 --> 43:45.690
