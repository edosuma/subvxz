00:00.200 --> 00:02.000
Previous on One Tree Hill

00:03.743 --> 00:04.877
Hey. I'm fine. see?

00:04.877 --> 00:07.578
Don't play slamball anymore, daddy.

00:08.147 --> 00:09.647
What your version of grounded?

00:09.682 --> 00:12.110
One week for letting some skeevy fratvestite

00:12.110 --> 00:13.502
Ruin peyton's wedding dress,

00:13.502 --> 00:15.107
And we're gonna tack on another week

00:15.107 --> 00:16.398
For throwing an underage keg party in

00:16.398 --> 00:18.456
Your foster parent's upscale boutique.

00:18.456 --> 00:20.240
How about we do that u.s.o. show?

00:20.240 --> 00:21.440
You'd do that?

00:21.440 --> 00:23.940
Sure. that's what family does, right?

00:24.430 --> 00:25.463
Don't.

00:25.531 --> 00:27.799
Gigi, I have a girlfriend.

00:27.833 --> 00:30.500
And she doesn't have to know.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.614
you've gotten even more beautiful.

00:33.614 --> 00:34.884
What are you doing here, julian?

00:34.884 --> 00:37.232
Haven't you heard I'm optioning your fiance's book.

00:37.232 --> 00:38.219
Like hell you are.

00:38.219 --> 00:40.150
Actually, it's already done.

00:40.150 --> 00:41.637
I'm quite charming.

00:41.637 --> 00:43.300
But you know that, baby.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.200
I need to tell you something.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.000
Does it involve this?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.200
We were in love.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.800
Hey, marines!

01:01.600 --> 01:04.400
How's everybody doing tonight?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.438
All right, that's fantastic.

01:06.472 --> 01:09.000
It is so great to be here tonight!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.571
Now, I am so pumped to

01:10.571 --> 01:12.178
introduce our first act tonight.

01:12.178 --> 01:15.880
She is a very dear friend of mine and also an amazing talent.

01:15.915 --> 01:19.851
Please give it up for haley james scott!

02:41.700 --> 02:43.034
Haley?

02:43.069 --> 02:44.736
Hey, I'm in here.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.600
How'd it go at the doctor's?

02:50.800 --> 02:53.050
That is so not funny.

02:53.050 --> 02:54.350
Yeah, I guess you're right.

02:56.615 --> 02:58.183
I'm fine.

02:58.217 --> 03:00.800
I'm supposed to take it easy for a few days, that's all.

03:01.387 --> 03:03.700
So, are you excited for the u.s.o. show?

03:03.700 --> 03:05.724
Honestly, no.

03:05.758 --> 03:08.190
I had this nightmare last night

03:08.190 --> 03:11.630
That I got up onstage and I forgot the words to my song.

03:11.630 --> 03:13.805
I completely forgot. I just stood there.

03:13.805 --> 03:16.713
What am I gonna do if that happens tonight?

03:16.713 --> 03:19.435
Do you have any instrumental hits?

03:19.469 --> 03:21.760
It was just a dream, haley.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.301
You're gonna be great, okay?

03:23.301 --> 03:25.600
And I can't wait to see my sexy girl onstage.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.407
Not a chance. the doctor said you should stay home and relax,

03:28.407 --> 03:29.850
And you need to listen to him.

03:29.850 --> 03:31.247
I think I can handle a concert.

03:31.247 --> 03:32.683
Not gonna happen. besides,

03:32.683 --> 03:35.000
I don't want to overwhelm you with my sexiness

03:35.000 --> 03:37.500
When I throw up all over the stage.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.100
Come on.

03:39.100 --> 03:42.504
Do you remember the first time you sang to me at the cafe?

03:42.572 --> 03:44.973
Well, if you get nervous, just close your eyes

03:45.007 --> 03:46.575
And pretend like you're back there

03:46.609 --> 03:49.378
And it's just you and me, all right?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.560
yeah. I like that. thank you.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.514
I love you, nathan scott.

03:56.514 --> 03:57.814
I love you.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.300
You said, "okay."

04:05.000 --> 04:07.795
Last night, when I told you that julian and I used to be in love,

04:07.795 --> 04:08.900
You said, "okay."

04:08.900 --> 04:10.200
Okay.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.650
No, no, you can't just say it's okay, all right?

04:12.650 --> 04:14.930
You're supposed to be jealous

04:14.930 --> 04:17.100
Or ask questions...

04:17.100 --> 04:19.000
Or get mad.

04:19.221 --> 04:20.721
Okay.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.000
You can stop with the okays!

04:33.400 --> 04:35.400
It's not okay.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.600
Are they okay?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.300
Delicious.

04:40.335 --> 04:42.950
But, you know, my complete guide to raising a teenager

04:42.950 --> 04:44.600
Says that if your teen cooks for you,

04:44.600 --> 04:48.450
They're likely to ask for something or confess to something.

04:48.450 --> 04:49.870
So let me just tell you right now

04:49.870 --> 04:51.590
Whatever you did, I am so impressed.

04:51.590 --> 04:53.100
You're not in trouble.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.088
I just wanted to do something nice for you.

04:55.088 --> 04:56.120
Really?

04:56.120 --> 04:57.720
Besides, I think that book said

04:57.720 --> 05:00.145
Breakfast in bed and doing the dishes after,

05:00.145 --> 05:01.650
which is not happening.

05:01.650 --> 05:02.970
I see.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.600
So, are you excited to work for peyton at the concert tonight,

05:05.600 --> 05:09.600
Get backstage with angels & airwaves?

05:09.600 --> 05:10.867
Yeah.

05:10.902 --> 05:13.270
Yeah, I guess it'll be pretty cool.

05:14.672 --> 05:17.374
No. let the machine get it.

05:17.408 --> 05:18.800
I want to enjoy this time with you,

05:18.800 --> 05:21.178
Which my book says will rarely, if ever, happen.

05:21.245 --> 05:23.947
You've reached brooke davis. you know what to do.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.780
Hi, brooke, it's patricia from the adoption agency.

05:27.780 --> 05:30.820
I need to speak with you regarding placement for a newborn.

05:30.820 --> 05:33.120
Please call me as soon as possible.

05:36.275 --> 05:40.011
Wow. you're like the new angelina.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.367
Hey, it's me.

05:54.401 --> 05:57.270
Millie? hi. how are you?

05:57.304 --> 06:00.239
Great. what'd you do last night?

06:00.274 --> 06:01.707
Uh, last night?

06:01.742 --> 06:05.511
I-i just worked again late. I worked late.

06:05.511 --> 06:07.810
Well, I just wanted to let you know that I'm back,

06:07.810 --> 06:09.181
And I'll be home shortly.

06:09.216 --> 06:12.184
Oh, great, shortly. t-that's awesome.

06:12.219 --> 06:14.554
How long do you think you'll be?

06:14.621 --> 06:16.088
Uh, 5, maybe 10 minutes?

06:18.926 --> 06:21.928
Okay, great. I'll -- I'll see you then.

06:21.962 --> 06:23.195
See you then.

06:23.230 --> 06:25.100
Oh, and, marvin, can you do one small thing for me

06:25.100 --> 06:26.700
Before I get there?

06:26.700 --> 06:28.400
Yeah, sure, anything.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.400
Get that slut out of my bed.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.000
Oh, hey, luke. how you doing?

06:50.700 --> 06:52.000
It's okey of the movie?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.534
Hell, no.

06:53.568 --> 06:54.500
Why not?

06:54.800 --> 06:55.600
Why not?

06:55.600 --> 06:57.200
The entire time the guy's been in town,

06:57.200 --> 06:59.300
He's been pretending not to know peyton.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.000
I'm sure he has his reasons.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.570
Bro, I came over here

07:02.570 --> 07:04.832
So that you could compliment me on knocking the guy out.

07:04.832 --> 07:07.735
I'm just saying sometimes it's better to walk away.

07:07.735 --> 07:09.583
Who are you right now?

07:09.617 --> 07:11.710
-Hales, tell him. -what?

07:11.710 --> 07:14.322
I had to have a little talk with her about walking away, too.

07:14.332 --> 07:17.610
Oh, you are just full of funny today, aren't you?

07:18.200 --> 07:20.461
What happened to you?

07:20.495 --> 07:21.962
He decked julian.

07:21.996 --> 07:23.330
Why?

07:23.365 --> 07:25.000
He was dating peyton in l.a.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.190
Really?

07:26.190 --> 07:28.170
Yeah, apparently they were in love.

07:28.170 --> 07:29.850
Nice. sorry.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.100
I just really appreciate when the drama's not about us.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.842
Yeah, you guys suck right now. you know that?

07:36.111 --> 07:37.644
All right, I'm off.

07:37.679 --> 07:40.481
Jamie and orval are at andre's for the night.

07:40.515 --> 07:43.350
-Who's orval? -orval is jamie's imaginary

07:43.418 --> 07:45.452
Well, he's technically chester's imaginary friend,

07:45.487 --> 07:47.280
But jamie takes him places.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.950
-Seriously?  -Yeah.

07:48.950 --> 07:52.737
If orval's the worst of our worries, I think we're doing pretty good.

07:53.311 --> 07:55.311
Okay, wish me luck.

07:55.311 --> 07:56.811
Good luck.

07:58.911 --> 08:01.250
Mm. wish me luck, too.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.654
Ugh, get out of here.

08:02.654 --> 08:04.367
Thanks for the ice, and,

08:04.367 --> 08:08.125
No, actually, just thank you for the ice.

08:08.521 --> 08:12.323
Come on, punchy. you can tell me all about it.

08:12.391 --> 08:13.758
Imaginary friend.

08:13.792 --> 08:16.893
I knew my kid would end up weird.

08:16.893 --> 08:20.465
now, why you got to go call having an imaginary friend weird?

08:22.768 --> 08:24.068
Gigi, get up.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.267
Mmm. come back to bed, baby.

08:27.267 --> 08:29.293
No. no, no, no, no. and don't call me baby.

08:29.293 --> 08:30.550
Come on. you got to go.

08:30.550 --> 08:32.549
Why? what's the problem?

08:32.549 --> 08:34.669
The problem is milicent, my girlfriend,

08:34.669 --> 08:36.179
Who's gonna be here any second.

08:36.179 --> 08:38.160
You think she'd like to join us?

08:38.160 --> 08:39.491
I think she wants to kill us.

08:39.491 --> 08:40.830
Me. there is no "us."

08:40.830 --> 08:42.159
Come on, gigi. move your ass.

08:42.159 --> 08:43.251
And don't say "you'd like that"

08:43.251 --> 08:44.430
And don't say "i will if you watch"

08:44.430 --> 08:45.859
And don't say "you first."

08:45.859 --> 08:47.132
Please, you're killing me.

08:47.132 --> 08:48.500
Fine.

08:51.300 --> 08:53.300
Man, my head hurts.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.245
I can't believe I let you get me drunk

08:57.245 --> 08:59.482
And take advantage of me last night.

08:59.482 --> 09:00.842
I didn't get you drunk.

09:00.842 --> 09:03.420
And I definitely did not take advantage of you.

09:03.420 --> 09:06.000
Then why am I in your t-shirt?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.200
You don't remember?

09:07.200 --> 09:10.020
You puked all over yourself and then passed out.

09:10.020 --> 09:12.300
I washed your shirt.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.131
Thanks.

09:14.131 --> 09:15.800
You're such a good guy.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.457
Yeah, well, I'm gonna be a dead guy

09:17.457 --> 09:19.264
If I don't get you out of here, seriously.

09:19.264 --> 09:21.759
I'll see you at work, but...

09:21.794 --> 09:23.795
I'll get your shirt.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.029
Mouth...

09:29.200 --> 09:30.775
Here's yours.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.200
Oh, my god.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.770
No. whatever it is, I can't deal with another store incident.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.311
There was a girl in my bed.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.846
Are you coming out?

09:41.880 --> 09:43.715
No, it was gigi! she was in my bed!

09:43.749 --> 09:48.086
Wait. you're a three-way With the hot high-school ex?

09:48.153 --> 09:49.454
Really?

09:49.488 --> 09:52.096
Actually, marvin and gigi had a slumber party last night.

09:52.096 --> 09:52.960
I walked in this morning

09:52.960 --> 09:55.502
And found that tramp-faced whore slut bitch in my bed!

09:55.502 --> 09:57.996
-With mouth? -no, he was on the couch!

09:59.365 --> 10:02.000
So, then, what's the problem?

10:02.034 --> 10:03.901
Do you think he cheated?

10:03.936 --> 10:07.957
Millie, you and mouth are, like, head-over-heels for each other.

10:07.957 --> 10:10.041
Why would he want to screw that up?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.350
Maybe because I don't sleep with him?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.700
What?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.650
I'm a virgin and mouth isn't

10:26.650 --> 10:29.500
And I'm sure he has needs and what if he fulfilled them?

10:29.500 --> 10:32.500
Back up a second. you're a virgin?

10:32.500 --> 10:34.865
You live together and you share a bed

10:34.865 --> 10:38.100
And you are still... intact?

10:41.100 --> 10:43.021
Well, you do the other stuff, though, right,

10:43.021 --> 10:46.400
Like, you know, the j's, "h" or "b"?

10:47.496 --> 10:50.465
Nothing at all?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.239
It's like finding a bigfoot or a unicorn or something!

10:57.273 --> 10:59.500
Maybe I should just have sex with him.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.400
No, no, no. it is not all about sex.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.700
Trust me.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.300
That boy loves you for exactly who you are.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.512
You just need to go home,

11:07.512 --> 11:10.900
And you need to talk to him about this, okay?

11:14.821 --> 11:16.855
Thanks, brooke.

11:18.591 --> 11:19.858
So, not even

11:19.893 --> 11:21.727
No.

11:25.832 --> 11:28.700
Test on one, test one two.

11:28.735 --> 11:31.245
Hey, it is gonna get really chaotic today,

11:31.245 --> 11:33.005
So in case I forget to say it later,

11:33.005 --> 11:34.343
Thank you for helping me.

11:34.343 --> 11:35.951
Well, I got to pay you back for your wedding dress somehow.

11:35.951 --> 11:37.560
This seems like a pretty cool way to do it.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.565
Yeah, about that.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.420
Tonight will pay for, like, a sleeve,

11:43.420 --> 11:46.650
But as long as you don't ruin anything else, I might let you live.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.915
So, can I ask you a question without getting slapped?

11:49.915 --> 11:52.415
Depends on what the question is.

11:53.561 --> 11:55.025
Um, brooke told me you were adopted.

11:55.025 --> 11:57.650
I was just wondering if you ever met your birth parents.

11:57.650 --> 12:01.205
Um, yeah, both of them, one pretty recently.

12:01.205 --> 12:02.701
That didn't turn out so great,

12:02.701 --> 12:06.960
But, my other parents are always gonna be my real parents,you know?

12:06.960 --> 12:09.182
Seems kind of greedy, though, don't you think?

12:09.182 --> 12:12.844
I mean, you've got like, what, four parents? I've got none.

12:12.844 --> 12:16.700
Well, you have brooke, and she's pretty great, right?

12:16.700 --> 12:20.000
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. I mean, she's getting another baby.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.316
A baby? how?

12:22.316 --> 12:26.191
You see, when two people love each other...

12:26.258 --> 12:28.860
Some lady from the adoption agency called,

12:28.894 --> 12:30.862
Said they had a kid for her.

12:30.896 --> 12:33.196
Hey, little sister.

12:35.334 --> 12:36.830
Um, derek, this is sam.

12:36.830 --> 12:39.330
Sam, this is my brother, derek.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.885
It's a long story. we have the same father.

12:41.885 --> 12:43.900
If you'd call him that, he's an ass.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.800
Derek has issues like you do!

12:46.800 --> 12:49.600
You're gonna have to let it go.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.550
It's a long story, but I'll explain everything.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.221
We were working late, and gigi got drunk.

12:56.221 --> 12:57.630
At work?

12:57.630 --> 13:00.020
Well, yeah, but it was after hours.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.680
You were drunk with your intern after hours?

13:01.680 --> 13:04.950
It sounds worse than it was. nothing happened.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.850
Gigi couldn't drive,

13:06.850 --> 13:09.300
And I didn't want to look like some creepy older guy

13:09.300 --> 13:11.075
Carrying a drunk coed into the dorms.

13:11.075 --> 13:14.300
She could have taken a cab or the couch, at least.

13:14.300 --> 13:17.000
I was just being respectful.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.250
I think you're paying too much respect to the wrong girl.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.150
I'm sorry.

13:22.150 --> 13:23.711
I swear it was innocent, millie.

13:23.711 --> 13:25.711
You know you can trust me.

13:26.018 --> 13:28.600
It's not you I'm worried about.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.400
And I have a new rule

13:30.457 --> 13:33.957
Nobody except us in our bed, not ever.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.164
And burn the sheets.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.800
Still here.

13:54.447 --> 13:55.914
Why?

13:55.949 --> 13:57.483
How?

13:57.517 --> 14:00.119
Why? because you need me right now.

14:00.186 --> 14:03.489
How?

14:03.523 --> 14:04.923
Well, maybe I'm in your head.

14:04.991 --> 14:07.760
Or maybe I'm still alive.

14:10.396 --> 14:13.165
Nope, I'm still dead.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.130
What do you want, "q"?

14:16.130 --> 14:18.804
What do I want? what do you want, nate, huh?

14:18.872 --> 14:20.706
Ain't you got a slamball championship game to

14:20.706 --> 14:22.541
be playing in tonight or something?

14:22.575 --> 14:24.610
I quit.

14:24.644 --> 14:26.845
You quit.

14:29.182 --> 14:31.350
Not much of a comeback.

14:34.487 --> 14:35.921
Ooh, peyton. ah!

14:35.955 --> 14:38.000
We just have a small problem.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.840
-I can't perform tonight. -what? why?

14:39.840 --> 14:42.012
Because, listen, I'm rusty and they're gonna hate me

14:42.012 --> 14:43.100
And I'm gonna ruin the show.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.400
No, no, you're not gonna ruin the show. you're gonna be great.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.650
No, I am gonna ruin the show because I'm nervous

14:46.650 --> 14:49.900
And I can't even remember the lines to my own song.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.733
Did I just hear what I thought I heard?

14:53.733 --> 14:55.238
Someone's a little nervous?

14:55.238 --> 14:57.570
Don't even start with me, you little brat.

14:57.570 --> 14:59.750
Nice. is that how you talk to your students?

14:59.750 --> 15:00.667
Yes.

15:00.667 --> 15:04.080
Mia, this is sam. she's gonna be your assistant tonight.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.720
So anything you want, ask her. she has a debt to pay off.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.639
Hey, sam. how about we just hang, thgh?

15:09.639 --> 15:11.757
I don't think I'm diva enough to have an assistant.

15:11.757 --> 15:13.900
Hey, thank you again for being a part of all this, mia.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.625
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.512
And, besides, if haley's gonna suck,

15:17.512 --> 15:19.400
I wouldn't miss that for anything, either.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.700
You're gonna be fine, hales.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.300
Besides, if you're not, who's even gonna notice?

15:24.800 --> 15:26.438
Them.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.810
Look at the cry out loud there, they are all waiting for you.

15:37.810 --> 15:41.150
Kind of like all the people waiting for your second record, huh?

15:41.495 --> 15:44.100
Right. it's gonna be fine.

15:47.367 --> 15:50.770
How's everybody doing tonight?!

15:50.837 --> 15:53.005
All right, that's good to hear.

15:53.040 --> 15:56.676
I got to tell you  I am so excited to be here tonight,

15:56.710 --> 16:01.056
And it's such an honor to be able to do this for my brother and his family.

16:01.056 --> 16:03.000
Thank you guys for having us.

16:03.684 --> 16:05.051
Mia, I forgot the first line of my song.

16:05.118 --> 16:06.519
Tell me what the first line of my song is.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.610
"it's got to be this one. you don't have to fake it."

16:10.619 --> 16:12.300
Now go get them.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.263
Please give it up for the one and only haley james scott!

17:22.000 --> 17:25.550
It's so weird to see my teacher being majorly cheered for.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.200
Well, get used to it. your teacher's a badass.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.200
Yeah, I guess.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.180
So, is it fun being on the road?

17:35.180 --> 17:37.450
Oh, dude, it's awesome.

17:37.450 --> 17:40.650
But sometimes it's hard sleeping in a different place every night.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.700
Yeah, I've done that.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.350
You probably feel guilty, huh,

18:05.350 --> 18:07.175
Scaring haley and jluke like that

18:07.175 --> 18:09.500
After they let you play and all?

18:11.700 --> 18:14.500
Yeah, it's probably a good thing that you quit.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.512
Got anything to say about that, huh?

18:18.512 --> 18:19.900
Nate!

18:19.900 --> 18:21.000
I'm ignoring you.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.922
Oh, you're ignoring me?

18:22.957 --> 18:25.558
You're ignoring me?

18:25.593 --> 18:29.029
Oh, well, let me ask you this, nate, huh?

18:29.063 --> 18:30.630
Did you quit basketball, or did you just quit slamball?

18:30.665 --> 18:32.866
What do you want from me?

18:34.900 --> 18:37.400
Now I'm ignoring you.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.139
Great. you're ignoring me,

18:39.173 --> 18:41.141
But you know that'll only work for about a minute,

18:41.208 --> 18:42.800
And then you're gonna crack a smile.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.100
What do you want from me? I'm busy.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.579
I need to talk to lucas.

18:46.614 --> 18:49.400
Okay, you should do that, then.

19:17.677 --> 19:19.979
Hey, brooke. good show, huh?

19:20.013 --> 19:21.800
Oh, I might just be in heaven.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.249
There are hot men in uniform everywhere I look,

19:23.283 --> 19:26.952
And I am the proud owner of a happy teen.

19:28.588 --> 19:29.922
Hey, let me ask you something.

19:29.956 --> 19:33.450
Has peyton ever mentioned this julian guy?

19:33.450 --> 19:35.150
Here we go.

19:35.150 --> 19:37.150
P. sawyer finally told you.

19:37.150 --> 19:39.125
You knew.

19:39.125 --> 19:40.983
Only because she didn't know how to tell you.

19:40.983 --> 19:42.850
I was just the practice dummy.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.238
She knew how excited you were about the movie,

19:46.273 --> 19:48.541
And she didn't want to ruin this for you.

19:48.575 --> 19:51.243
By the way, you are not allowed to be mad.

19:51.278 --> 19:52.878
Really? I'm not allowed to be mad

19:52.913 --> 19:54.950
That she hooked up with this guy right after we broke up?

19:54.950 --> 19:58.050
It was not right after. and seriously?

19:58.085 --> 19:59.800
You tried to hook up with me

19:59.800 --> 20:01.600
The night after you guys broke up.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.500
I would never tell peyton that,

20:03.500 --> 20:07.259
But, lucas, you almost married lindsey.

20:07.294 --> 20:09.962
Julian was just a rebound.

20:09.996 --> 20:12.362
Do girls fall in love with rebounds?

20:12.566 --> 20:14.801
Every time. but it's not real love.

20:14.900 --> 20:16.869
Your head tricks you into it to protect you

20:16.903 --> 20:19.472
From the crushing pain your heart is putting you through.

20:20.741 --> 20:24.110
So, go. kiss it out. it's gonna be fine.

20:28.115 --> 20:29.900
I would

20:29.900 --> 20:33.185
If I could squeeze in between her and rebound guy.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.150
all right you guys.

21:22.150 --> 21:25.120
I am a huge fan of the next actress we have

21:25.120 --> 21:26.780
She is young. she is very, very hot.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.050
Hear that? "young."

21:28.090 --> 21:29.890
Hey, I think I saw jason out there.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.260
She has a huge voice.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.890
Please give it up for mia catalano.

21:43.050 --> 21:45.210
Hey, guys.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.630
I just wanted to mention that I'm single.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.570
Just throwing that out there.

22:25.700 --> 22:28.840
You were great!

22:28.870 --> 22:30.910
Oh, my gosh! it's so good to see you!

22:31.810 --> 22:33.450
You going on tour anytime soon?

22:33.900 --> 22:37.030
Oh, no, no tour for me, not since I had my baby boy.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.020
Must have been a tough decision for you.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.440
No, not really.

22:40.510 --> 22:42.910
It's exciting, the cheers from the crowd,

22:42.940 --> 22:44.280
But they can't take the place of my family.

22:44.310 --> 22:46.000
That's what I want the most.

22:46.420 --> 22:48.390
Well, your son's lucky to have a mom

22:48.430 --> 22:50.330
That chose him over her career.

22:50.360 --> 22:51.900
I wasn't so lucky.

22:51.930 --> 22:53.730
Yeah. I'm sorry.

22:53.770 --> 22:57.200
We all make different choices,

22:57.230 --> 22:59.000
And different things.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.140
I think eventually we learn

23:01.170 --> 23:03.510
To define happiness for ourselves on our own terms,

23:03.540 --> 23:06.310
In spite of the pain other people have caused us.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.290
Thanks for last night, mouth.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.860
I'm really sorry I got so wasted.

23:24.930 --> 23:26.900
We could have slept in the same bed, though.

23:26.930 --> 23:28.570
I wouldn't have attacked you or anything.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.740
I don't think millie would have been

23:29.740 --> 23:30.970
Okay with us sleeping in the same bed.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.300
But you would have been okay with it?

23:33.340 --> 23:34.610
That's not what I meant.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.170
I wouldn't be okay with it

23:36.210 --> 23:37.680
Because millie wouldn't be okay with it.

23:37.740 --> 23:39.340
So if millie were okay with it, then --

23:39.340 --> 23:41.150
Let's just finish the piece,

23:41.180 --> 23:43.980
And I think we need to be a little more professional.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.880
You're kind of hot when you're mad.

24:09.540 --> 24:12.000
You must be julian.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.400
Brooke davis, I've read all about you.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.500
Good. then you know being the third person

24:19.800 --> 24:21.820
In a lucas/peyton love triangle usually doesn't end well.

24:22.550 --> 24:23.990
For who?

24:24.020 --> 24:25.760
I think it's pretty clear in the book

24:25.790 --> 24:27.990
If you're not lucas or peyton you should just forget it.

24:29.330 --> 24:32.300
And just so you know, they are two of my best friends.

24:32.330 --> 24:35.630
So if you mess with them, I will mess with you.

24:35.670 --> 24:38.870
that sounds like fun.

24:38.900 --> 24:41.670
Don't you have a blackberry coma to fall into?

24:42.140 --> 24:44.070
I love a feisty peyton.

24:44.110 --> 24:45.310
Do me a favor.

24:45.340 --> 24:47.540
Stop flirting with my best friend.

24:47.610 --> 24:48.850
I think she's jealous.

24:48.850 --> 24:50.000
Come on, brooke.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.500
We have to announce a band.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.000
We do?

24:53.420 --> 24:55.320
you're right.

24:55.350 --> 24:56.820
We have a band to announce.

25:22.710 --> 25:24.280
watch this play right here.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.350
He's about to throw an alley-oop to the dude right behind the line.

25:28.690 --> 25:29.790
Called it!

25:29.820 --> 25:32.020
You know, you're kind of ruing the game.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.760
Come on, man. you knew that was gonna happen.

25:33.790 --> 25:36.160
I just said it out loud. ooh!

25:40.970 --> 25:42.030
I'm calling it quits

25:42.070 --> 25:45.740
Because I don't want to end up back in that wheelchair,all right?

25:45.770 --> 25:47.970
I won't do that to haley and jamie again.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.540
So you're quitting for haley and jamie.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.950
Sure, that ma-- if that's your excuse.

26:00.620 --> 26:03.220
Look, I worked hard.

26:04.250 --> 26:06.220
And my dream started to come true again,

26:06.260 --> 26:10.190
And I started to believe that people just go through things,

26:10.230 --> 26:12.930
Challenges that make them stronger.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.600
And then you were gone.

26:14.630 --> 26:16.870
All right, I showed up at that river court,

26:16.900 --> 26:18.970
And you never came.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.370
And that was it, just like that.

26:21.410 --> 26:24.810
And I realized that -- that we're not invincible.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.210
Dreams die.

26:28.280 --> 26:29.950
So what?

26:31.720 --> 26:33.220
What you gonna do, nate?

26:33.220 --> 26:36.890
Sit here on this couch and watch ball on tv, afraid to live?!

26:36.920 --> 26:37.920
That's what you're gonna do?!

26:37.960 --> 26:40.720
That really pisses me off, nate.

26:40.760 --> 26:43.030
You know why?

26:43.060 --> 26:46.460
'cause you got a second chance, man.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.270
You did.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.900
I wish I did.

27:08.650 --> 27:10.720
How's the hand?

27:14.330 --> 27:18.160
I figured if you knew I had a history with peyton

27:18.230 --> 27:19.860
You wouldn't work with me.

27:22.770 --> 27:25.970
Look, I believe in the book. I want to make the movie.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.840
I'm not interested.

27:27.870 --> 27:29.710
Come on, luke. it's gonna be great.

27:31.140 --> 27:32.840
There's not gonna be a movie.

27:35.180 --> 27:39.950
Well, at the risk of getting punched again,

27:40.020 --> 27:41.820
I own the option to the book.

27:41.850 --> 27:46.560
So it's happening... with or without you.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.340
Hey, everybody, this is my friend brooke.

28:00.340 --> 28:04.200
She was begging me to come out and say hi to you guys.

28:04.210 --> 28:07.010
Hi, boys. it's an honor to be here.

28:08.650 --> 28:11.420
We just want to thank you guys so much for everything.

28:11.430 --> 28:12.880
We appreciate all that you do,

28:12.900 --> 28:15.000
And we appreciate every single one of you.

28:15.050 --> 28:16.500
You guys are the real rock stars.

28:17.700 --> 28:20.500
So, thank you very, very much.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.840
So, without further ado, let's give it up for...

28:23.870 --> 28:26.740
angels & airwaves!

28:43.890 --> 28:47.400
So, word is you're getting a baby.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.000
She's scared, you know.

28:50.900 --> 28:52.800
What do you mean?

28:52.800 --> 28:55.250
She told me about the phone call from the adoption agency.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.000
You should talk to her about it.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.970
I'm pretty sure she thinks her days with you are numbered.

29:39.080 --> 29:42.350
Here at slamball, as the slashers

29:42.380 --> 29:46.280
Take home the 2008 slamball title

29:46.310 --> 29:47.900
By knocking --

29:48.500 --> 29:51.000
Guess they didn't need me after all.

29:51.220 --> 29:54.620
Yeah, I guess you didn't need them, either.

29:54.900 --> 29:57.730
You know, there's more to life than basketball.

29:57.740 --> 29:59.100
Oh, is that right?

30:02.370 --> 30:06.140
Every time I get to see jamie laugh,

30:06.170 --> 30:09.200
I mean, that's a dream come true.

30:09.250 --> 30:14.040
Every time I get to hold haley, it's a dream come true.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.550
They're my life.

30:16.550 --> 30:17.800
And you owe it to them

30:17.900 --> 30:21.200
To be the very best version of yourself, man,

30:21.250 --> 30:23.800
The version where you fight for what you want,

30:23.950 --> 30:27.190
The version where you're not afraid to be great.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.000
You're better for them when you're living your dreams, man.

30:30.030 --> 30:34.800
And there is nothing -- nothing selfish about that.

30:53.890 --> 30:55.800
Hey. millie, right?

30:55.800 --> 30:56.900
Mouth's not here right now.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.840
I know. I'm here to see you.

30:59.340 --> 31:00.640
What's up?

31:00.640 --> 31:01.800
I know you had some sort

31:02.000 --> 31:03.640
Of high-school puppy-love thing with marvin,

31:03.890 --> 31:06.000
But you need to back off.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.670
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:07.670 --> 31:13.030
I think you do And I don't trust you or like you.

31:13.030 --> 31:15.490
So how about you stay out of my bed

31:15.490 --> 31:18.600
And stay away from marvin?

31:35.584 --> 31:38.152
Hey. awesome.

31:38.186 --> 31:40.900
Um, can I borrow you for a second?

31:48.405 --> 31:49.870
Look, I want to talk to you

31:49.870 --> 31:52.490
About the message from this morning about the baby.

31:52.490 --> 31:53.510
It's none of my business.

31:53.510 --> 31:56.722
It is absolutely your business, sam.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.151
Look, I get it, okay?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.560
Everyone wants the puppy, not the mutt.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.400
It's happened before. I know what happens next.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.837
You get the baby, I go back to the pound.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.777
You are not going back to the pound.

32:14.500 --> 32:18.782
I don't ever want you to feel threatened or afraid

32:18.782 --> 32:21.400
That I'm gonna ask you to leave.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.257
My home is your home now, sam,

32:26.324 --> 32:29.660
And it's gonna be that way as long as you want it to be.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.718
I'm sorry.

33:06.924 --> 33:08.925
Did julian talk to you?

33:10.861 --> 33:12.361
And?

33:12.800 --> 33:14.324
I'm not gonna do the movie.

33:14.324 --> 33:15.300
What?

33:15.300 --> 33:17.400
He's gonna make it anyway.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.636
No, he can't. he can't do that without you.

33:19.636 --> 33:21.444
I signed the rights over to him.

33:21.444 --> 33:23.161
He can do whatever he wants with it.

33:23.161 --> 33:26.350
Luke, he can't just take it away from you.

33:26.384 --> 33:30.354
Look, peyton, I don't want to work with him, okay?

33:30.388 --> 33:33.023
I don't trust the guy.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.500
I just want him out of our lives.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.460
This is my fault.

33:36.494 --> 33:38.962
I should have just told you right away.

33:38.997 --> 33:39.650
Look, it's okay

33:39.879 --> 33:42.466
There will be other books, other movies.

33:42.490 --> 33:43.801
Yeah, but --

33:43.868 --> 33:44.902
It's okay.

33:44.936 --> 33:47.871
It's okay.

34:02.150 --> 34:04.025
hey,big brother,what do you think?

34:04.026 --> 34:06.661
I think it couldn't have been better. Thank you, peyton.

34:06.661 --> 34:09.400
Oh, my god, it was nothing. I'm happy I could do it.

34:09.400 --> 34:14.268
It means a lot to the marines...and to me.

34:15.310 --> 34:17.639
And it -- it made me realize

34:17.672 --> 34:20.480
I've wasted too much time being upset

34:20.480 --> 34:23.100
About the family I didn't have.

34:23.300 --> 34:24.312
I need to spend more time

34:24.380 --> 34:27.380
Being thankful for the family I do have.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.319
Feels kind of good to let it go, doesn't it?

34:35.491 --> 34:37.815
Hey, thanks for letting me hang out with you all night.

34:37.815 --> 34:39.315
It was way cool.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.588
Um, not to be lame or anything,

34:41.588 --> 34:43.984
But can I get your autograph?

34:43.984 --> 34:44.984
Sure!

34:44.984 --> 34:48.146
How about I give you my number instead?

34:48.146 --> 34:50.310
Call me sometime, and we'll hang out.

34:50.310 --> 34:51.581
Really?

34:51.581 --> 34:52.686
Yeah.

34:52.686 --> 34:54.275
Peyton and haley and brooke are really cool,

34:54.310 --> 34:56.643
But they're kind of boring.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.651
I thought I'd head home.

35:03.651 --> 35:05.308
Sure, that's fine.

35:05.308 --> 35:07.400
You think you could walk me to my car?

35:07.400 --> 35:09.403
I'm not hitting on you.

35:09.405 --> 35:12.507
It's dark and they never found out who killed quentin fields

35:12.600 --> 35:14.858
And it creeps me out.

35:14.892 --> 35:17.928
Okay.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.815
This is me.

35:24.815 --> 35:27.100
Sorry to be such a girl.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.782
Ah, no problem. drive safe.

35:28.782 --> 35:30.082
Mouth?

35:31.600 --> 35:34.440
I don't want to cause any trouble with you and your girlfriend.

35:34.440 --> 35:37.171
I'll try to be better about it.

35:37.206 --> 35:38.706
I appreciate that.

35:49.651 --> 35:51.650
Oh, hey. thank you very much.

35:53.700 --> 35:54.760
Peyton, can I talk to you?

35:54.762 --> 35:56.390
Oh, you have a lot of nerve.

35:56.390 --> 35:58.080
You show up in tree hill unannounced,

35:58.080 --> 35:59.600
You get lucas to sign his book over,

35:59.600 --> 36:01.563
And then you tell him you're gonna make the movie without him?

36:01.597 --> 36:03.335
Okay, that's not exactly what happened.

36:03.359 --> 36:06.314
I apologized to lucas and told him I wanted him on the movie.

36:06.314 --> 36:08.352
He said he didn't want any part of it,

36:08.400 --> 36:10.700
And I even let him punch me.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.400
He punched you?

36:15.024 --> 36:18.163
Look, the point is, I believe in this book,

36:18.163 --> 36:20.177
And I want to make this movie.

36:20.177 --> 36:22.416
And, yes, I told him that I could do it without him,

36:22.416 --> 36:25.620
But the truth is, I need him to help me tell this story.

36:25.620 --> 36:27.315
That's all I want, nothing else.

36:27.350 --> 36:28.516
You're lying.

36:28.584 --> 36:30.986
No, I'm not, and you know I'm not.

36:31.020 --> 36:33.000
This is business, peyton.

36:33.723 --> 36:35.790
You need to convince lucas to do the movie.

36:35.858 --> 36:38.259
And you'll make it the movie he wants it to be.

36:38.259 --> 36:39.326
Absolutely.

36:39.326 --> 36:41.732
'cause if I convince him to do this And you are lying, I swear

36:41.732 --> 36:43.680
I give you my word.

36:48.210 --> 36:49.371
I'll talk to him.

36:58.274 --> 37:00.200
What is all this?

37:00.547 --> 37:01.650
Oh, my goodness.

37:01.890 --> 37:04.386
And please tell me you didn't move the furniture by yourself.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.042
My back is fine.

37:07.049 --> 37:08.200
How'd you do today?

37:09.020 --> 37:10.025
I loved it.

37:10.942 --> 37:12.565
I was so scared at first,

37:12.566 --> 37:15.863
And then...it just started to feel right.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.780
I felt alive. it was awesome.

37:19.417 --> 37:22.319
I'm so bummed that I didn't get to see you.

37:22.354 --> 37:24.655
I know. me too, baby.

37:24.689 --> 37:27.258
If you're not too tired, I was hoping for an encore.

37:27.292 --> 37:30.060
I would love that.

37:36.319 --> 37:37.853
Haley

37:40.524 --> 37:43.859
let's promise never to be too scared to live our dreams.

37:45.863 --> 37:47.363
I promise.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.500
Me too.

38:14.524 --> 38:16.692
Hi, patricia. it's brooke davis.

38:16.693 --> 38:18.360
I'm calling regarding your message.

38:18.360 --> 38:21.350
Yes, I am definitely interested,

38:21.350 --> 38:24.750
And I just wanted you to know That I'm currently fostering a teenager,

38:24.750 --> 38:27.403
And it's going great, so

38:29.237 --> 38:31.171
Uh, no.

38:31.206 --> 38:35.509
No, I didn't realize that would complicate things.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.815
You punched julian.

38:56.849 --> 38:58.383
Yeah.

38:58.417 --> 39:00.885
That was me not being jealous.

39:01.553 --> 39:03.822
Okay.

39:03.856 --> 39:05.423
"okay"?

39:06.700 --> 39:08.393
I'm happy you got jealous.

39:09.800 --> 39:10.428
Really?

39:12.295 --> 39:14.560
But even though I'm happy,

39:14.560 --> 39:16.975
I do think you should do the movie.

39:18.700 --> 39:20.050
I think you're gonna regret

39:20.050 --> 39:21.949
Seeing it made without you, luke,

39:22.783 --> 39:25.000
And it's your story to tell.

39:25.700 --> 39:29.123
And julian doesn't think the movie can get made without you.

39:29.157 --> 39:30.825
I agree.

39:32.354 --> 39:34.020
You talked to julian?

39:34.560 --> 39:37.755
Look, you can punch him in the face anytime you want, okay?

39:38.188 --> 39:41.330
But I don't want you to walk away from this

39:41.337 --> 39:43.110
For the wrong reasons.

39:43.383 --> 39:45.915
I don't want you to have any regrets.

39:49.211 --> 39:54.682
You know... it's hard for me to know

39:54.716 --> 39:56.817
That you were in love with this guy.

39:58.620 --> 40:02.314
But you have been so strong and so good to me

40:03.494 --> 40:05.860
When I've strayed from us.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.805
So I'm gonna try to let go of it, okay?

40:12.900 --> 40:17.665
Besides, who wouldn't fall in love with you, peyton sawyer?

40:28.400 --> 40:30.192
I really enjoyed the encore.

40:30.192 --> 40:31.287
Oh, good.

40:31.300 --> 40:35.900
I think you're going to enjoy the encore to the encore

40:39.060 --> 40:41.177
I'm proud of you, haley.

40:47.652 --> 40:49.753
Oh, geez!

40:50.200 --> 40:51.700
You got to stop doing that, "q."

40:51.700 --> 40:53.326
You scared the crap out of me.

40:53.326 --> 40:56.000
Dude, you scared the crap out of you. I'm dead.

40:58.210 --> 40:59.800
I know you are.

41:00.300 --> 41:02.399
I miss you, "q."

41:02.400 --> 41:05.191
Nate, that's all right.You just focus on the comeback

41:05.191 --> 41:08.870
And I'll be there every step of the way.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.600
Oh, and, nate...

41:15.100 --> 41:17.400
That phone is gonna ring someday.

41:17.749 --> 41:18.700
Live the life.

Live the dream.
