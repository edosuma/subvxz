WEBVTT

00:07.462 --> 00:09.147
WOMAN: We need
to turn around.

00:09.149 --> 00:10.965
We're nowhere
near Park Avenue.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.650
You saying I
can't read a map?

00:12.652 --> 00:14.185
Or street signs.
Give me that.

00:14.187 --> 00:15.820
MAN: Okay, look,
you already ate half of it.

00:15.822 --> 00:17.605
I didn't eat half of it.
You ate half.

00:17.607 --> 00:19.857
This is not half of it.
So, maybe I should only give you

00:19.859 --> 00:21.476
half of your money...
Half of it... Oh! Come on!

00:21.478 --> 00:23.278
So, I got us
on the list at the club,

00:23.280 --> 00:24.412
and don't you dare wear red,

00:24.414 --> 00:26.164
because I just bought
the perfect red dress.

00:26.166 --> 00:28.533
MAN 2: ...tickets!
Who wants tickets?

00:28.535 --> 00:30.034
Free comedy show!

00:30.569 --> 00:32.787
(people screaming)

00:35.874 --> 00:37.875
GORMLEY:
<i>You're kidding me.</i>

00:37.877 --> 00:38.993
<i>In Times Square? All right.</i>

00:38.995 --> 00:39.994
(hangs up phone)

00:39.996 --> 00:43.298
Reagan, Baez,
we got a fresh one.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.767
Hello?

00:47.469 --> 00:49.587
Hello?!

00:57.112 --> 01:00.198
ALL:
Surprise!

01:00.200 --> 01:02.033
(all cheering, Gormley laughs)

01:02.035 --> 01:03.534
(horn sounding)
(laughs)

01:03.536 --> 01:05.737
What do you think, Sarge?
Baked it myself.

01:05.739 --> 01:06.537
Really?

01:06.539 --> 01:07.905
That's right.
No.

01:07.907 --> 01:09.958
He was just the only guy willing
to cough up two bucks for it.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.192
Mm. Yeah, right.

01:11.194 --> 01:12.577
Well, I got
a present

01:12.579 --> 01:13.711
for the two of you.

01:13.713 --> 01:14.912
Shooting on 43rd
and Times Square.

01:14.914 --> 01:17.081
So, grab your coats
and get a move on.

01:17.083 --> 01:18.249
What? Come on, Sarge.

01:18.251 --> 01:19.550
You got to make a wish first.

01:21.203 --> 01:22.920
All right! All right!
Yay!

01:22.922 --> 01:24.088
(applause)
Didn't come true.

01:24.090 --> 01:25.206
You're still here.

01:25.208 --> 01:26.540
(laughs)
Let's go.

01:26.542 --> 01:28.009
Back to work.
Ah.

01:31.764 --> 01:34.265
MAN: And that's why
I'm so proud to be here

01:34.267 --> 01:36.401
on the flight deck
of the USS <i>Intrepid.</i>

01:36.403 --> 01:39.487
You know, first question
I always get is,

01:39.489 --> 01:41.656
"Pete, what's it like
up in space?"

01:41.658 --> 01:43.441
And the truth is,
I don't think

01:43.443 --> 01:46.194
the words have been
invented yet to describe it.

01:46.196 --> 01:50.865
Just how black that sky is,
just how bright those stars are.

01:50.867 --> 01:53.201
And of course,
the second question that people

01:53.203 --> 01:54.619
always ask me is,

01:54.621 --> 01:57.288
"How the hell do you go
to the bathroom up there?"

01:57.290 --> 02:00.741
(laughter)

02:02.594 --> 02:05.079
Well, all you really
need to know

02:05.081 --> 02:08.098
is that I was sure glad
it worked back in '99

02:08.101 --> 02:09.967
when I was coming back

02:09.969 --> 02:11.686
to Earth in <i>Discovery.</i>

02:11.688 --> 02:13.388
Two of the hydraulic systems

02:13.390 --> 02:14.689
had already failed.

02:14.691 --> 02:16.590
One of 'em was looking
pretty iffy.

02:16.592 --> 02:18.109
I'm trying to bring this bird

02:18.111 --> 02:20.144
back down on a lakebed,

02:20.146 --> 02:24.065
with all the alarms going off
around me in the cockpit...

02:24.067 --> 02:26.984
Got to tell you,
if I was gonna murder somebody,

02:26.986 --> 02:28.986
I'd definitely pick
a more secluded location.

02:28.988 --> 02:30.705
Shooter either
has a lot of balls,

02:30.707 --> 02:31.956
or not a lot of brains.

02:31.958 --> 02:35.443
Careful. I made a whole career
off of that combination.

02:35.445 --> 02:37.462
MAN: Here's the vic's
cell phone, Detective.

02:37.464 --> 02:38.713
What do you got?

02:38.715 --> 02:40.715
Martin Cahill, 28 years old.

02:40.717 --> 02:43.167
Address says he lives uptown.

02:43.169 --> 02:46.554
Rorsch Financial I.D.
says he works downtown.

02:46.556 --> 02:48.840
Looks like he died
texting somebody named Tess.

02:48.842 --> 02:50.641
"Heading home now. XOXO."

02:50.643 --> 02:52.143
But he never pressed send.

02:52.145 --> 02:53.678
Great.
That means it'll be us

02:53.680 --> 02:55.897
walking through
Tess's door instead.

02:55.899 --> 02:57.348
Yeah, worst part of the job.

02:57.350 --> 02:58.516
Tell me about it.

02:58.518 --> 02:59.901
We got witnesses.

02:59.903 --> 03:02.403
Okay, who saw what over here?

03:02.405 --> 03:04.272
Oh, I saw the whole thing.

03:04.274 --> 03:08.309
Guy came out of the crowd,
shot the other guy, walked off.

03:08.311 --> 03:09.527
Nothing said?
No argument?

03:09.529 --> 03:10.828
MAN:
Nah, this guy--

03:10.830 --> 03:12.530
he's calm, you know,
like a cucumber.

03:12.532 --> 03:13.831
BAEZ:
Cool...

03:13.833 --> 03:15.833
as a cucumber,
but we get your drift.

03:15.835 --> 03:17.919
Okay, look--
what'd the guy look like?

03:17.921 --> 03:20.505
Oh, he was a tall white guy
in a parka.

03:20.507 --> 03:22.323
Uh-huh.
Ah! No, no!

03:22.325 --> 03:24.158
He is short guy
with baseball cap, okay?

03:24.160 --> 03:25.659
And he's black.
WOMAN: He was white.

03:25.661 --> 03:27.295
He was...
One at a time, all right?

03:27.297 --> 03:28.662
Did you see which way
the guy fled?

03:28.664 --> 03:29.663
Yes, he went that way.

03:29.665 --> 03:30.998
No, no, huh-huh, he goes

03:31.000 --> 03:32.633
this way, all right?
And he's a black guy.

03:32.635 --> 03:34.218
WOMAN: What do you know?
You were

03:34.220 --> 03:36.170
all the way over there
in your barfmobile.
Officer?

03:36.172 --> 03:37.638
Look, shut up, you rich bitch, okay?!
Oh, don't yell at me,

03:37.640 --> 03:39.056
falafel man.
BAEZ: Hey, now, okay...

03:39.058 --> 03:40.674
MAN: Look, she can't call me
these kind of things...!

03:40.676 --> 03:42.093
BAEZ: All right,
you, over there...

03:42.095 --> 03:44.061
Tell me you got
this thing on tape.

03:44.063 --> 03:46.981
No. I want a
picture with you.

03:46.983 --> 03:49.117
We're from Idaho.

03:49.119 --> 03:51.068
This is so cool!

03:51.070 --> 03:54.122
Yeah. Real cool.

FRANK:
What a load.

04:26.496 --> 04:28.580
You made that stuff up
about landing <i>Discovery.</i>

04:28.582 --> 04:30.314
(laughs)

04:30.316 --> 04:33.168
Hey, you got to give the people
what they want to hear.

04:33.170 --> 04:36.204
And where in the hell you been
hiding the last couple years?

04:36.206 --> 04:39.541
Come on, I could ask you
the same thing, Commissioner.

04:39.543 --> 04:41.543
Yeah, I know.

04:41.545 --> 04:43.762
Time goes by.

04:43.764 --> 04:46.598
Hey, I got a question.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.500
Why is it you never went
into flight school?

04:49.502 --> 04:52.687
You mean because I outscored
you on all the tests?

04:52.689 --> 04:54.055
Ah!

04:54.057 --> 04:56.608
Well, that explains it then--
your crappy memory.

04:56.610 --> 04:59.360
Well, you know,
I thought about it.

04:59.362 --> 05:02.781
But somehow,
I thought I was meant

05:02.783 --> 05:06.234
to be a Marine on the ground
with a gun in my hand.

05:06.236 --> 05:08.519
Not to mention,
Mary had a vote.

05:08.521 --> 05:10.354
Anyway...

05:10.356 --> 05:12.741
how's Amy and Heather?
They all right?

05:12.743 --> 05:14.525
Oh, yeah. Never better.

05:14.527 --> 05:15.910
Yeah.
Good.

05:15.912 --> 05:18.163
The program's over,
of course, now, so...

05:18.165 --> 05:20.081
You're out of a
job, my friend.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.966
Yeah, straight
from the wild blue yonder

05:21.968 --> 05:23.918
to the big pink slip.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.037
How about another, hmm?

05:26.039 --> 05:28.056
Nah.

05:28.058 --> 05:29.758
I'm good, but you go ahead.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.060
Listen... (clears throat)

05:32.062 --> 05:34.545
Amy has always loved this city.

05:34.547 --> 05:37.265
And Heather's planning
on going to school at NYU

05:37.267 --> 05:39.550
for grad school,
and I would love

05:39.552 --> 05:40.902
to find something here.

05:40.904 --> 05:42.771
Just some advisory position,

05:42.773 --> 05:45.523
uh, one company or another.

05:45.525 --> 05:48.693
I'm just wondering
if you could help me out.

05:48.695 --> 05:52.063
Oh, come on.
You've golfed with presidents.

05:52.065 --> 05:53.531
Ex-presidents,
who are all trying

05:53.533 --> 05:55.333
to find their own
second act right now.

05:55.335 --> 05:57.202
No, you are connected, Frank,

05:57.204 --> 05:59.570
in New York City,
every which way,

05:59.572 --> 06:01.039
right at this very minute.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.924
(laughs)
Maybe you could put out

06:02.926 --> 06:06.244
a few feelers for me, huh?

06:06.246 --> 06:10.381
I did sort of carry your sorry
Marine ass, back in the day.

06:10.383 --> 06:12.583
Now who's got the lousy memory?

06:12.585 --> 06:15.386
Listen, I'd... I'd be happy to.

06:15.388 --> 06:16.771
But I got a question:

06:16.773 --> 06:17.889
Hm?

06:17.891 --> 06:20.108
How <i>do</i> you go to the
bathroom up there?

06:20.110 --> 06:22.310
(laughs)

06:22.312 --> 06:24.445
Hey, I'm serious, man.

06:30.102 --> 06:32.070
Did Martin suffer?

06:32.072 --> 06:34.322
No. It happened
very fast.

06:34.324 --> 06:38.326
He was trying to text you
that he was on his way home.

06:38.328 --> 06:41.379
(crying)

06:41.381 --> 06:43.581
I'd been trying to get him

06:43.583 --> 06:46.050
to come home early

06:46.052 --> 06:48.887
to tell him
what I just found out.

06:48.889 --> 06:51.956
You're pregnant?

06:51.958 --> 06:55.560
We were going to celebrate.

07:00.482 --> 07:02.150
(sighs)

07:02.152 --> 07:05.687
Look, it appears
that your husband was targeted.

07:05.689 --> 07:08.606
Do you have any idea who
would want to hurt him?

07:08.608 --> 07:09.824
No.

07:09.826 --> 07:12.193
Did he have
any disgruntled clients?

07:12.195 --> 07:15.363
Any clients with ties
to organized crime, anything?

07:15.365 --> 07:19.250
Never.
Martin didn't deserve this.

07:19.252 --> 07:20.251
I know.

07:20.253 --> 07:21.753
He should be here

07:21.755 --> 07:23.788
with me and our baby.

07:23.790 --> 07:25.707
Please, find the person who did this.
Okay...

07:25.709 --> 07:27.759
Please.
Okay.

07:30.246 --> 07:31.429
She's a badge bunny, Vin.

07:31.431 --> 07:33.147
So what? She's dated
a couple other cops?

07:33.149 --> 07:35.416
And half a dozen
firefighters

07:35.418 --> 07:37.852
That's all in
the past, Reagan.

07:37.854 --> 07:39.304
All right?
Okay.

07:39.306 --> 07:40.388
I don't appreciate your tone,

07:40.390 --> 07:41.505
'cause Tanya's the one.

07:41.507 --> 07:42.673
Okay.
I mean that.

07:42.675 --> 07:44.759
All right.
What is going on?

07:44.761 --> 07:46.277
WOMAN: Stop!
WOMAN 2: Hey, stop!

07:46.279 --> 07:47.896
Hey!
MAN: Hey! Look out!

07:47.898 --> 07:49.597
Hey, hey.
Hey...

07:49.599 --> 07:50.999
(horn honking)

07:51.001 --> 07:52.233
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey...!

07:52.235 --> 07:54.518
(boy sobs)

07:54.520 --> 07:55.620
You all right?

07:55.622 --> 07:57.205
He's got blood on him, Vin.
Call it in.

07:57.207 --> 07:58.957
Central 12 David.
I need a bus.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.208
Hey, you okay?
Hey, talk to me.

08:00.210 --> 08:01.542
VINNY: ...48th between
Eighth and Ninth, forthwith.

08:01.544 --> 08:03.527
(gasps)

08:03.529 --> 08:06.047
You okay, bud?
(sobs)

08:09.251 --> 08:11.719
I stopped by Rorsch Financial
on the way in.

08:11.721 --> 08:13.554
Tell me you got
something good, partner.

08:13.556 --> 08:17.091
Coworkers say Martin Cahill
was a great guy, no enemies.

08:17.093 --> 08:19.477
Great. I got the same thing
from his wife.

08:19.479 --> 08:21.879
Went through his computer
and e-mails-- squeaky clean.

08:21.881 --> 08:24.315
So why does a saint get
gunned down out of nowhere?

08:24.317 --> 08:25.817
What's that? I can't hear you

08:25.819 --> 08:27.936
over our case getting colder
by the minute.

08:27.938 --> 08:31.222
Well, maybe your second crime
scene will warm things up.

08:31.224 --> 08:32.740
Second crime scene?

08:32.741 --> 08:34.909
Another shooting just went down,
this time in the Bronx.

08:34.910 --> 08:36.193
A retirement home.

08:36.196 --> 08:38.363
How do you know it's our guy?
Same M.O.

08:38.365 --> 08:39.948
Killer strolls up to the vic,

08:39.950 --> 08:42.750
shoots without saying a word,
strolls off.

08:42.751 --> 08:44.836
Want to take a chance
it's just a coincidence?

08:44.838 --> 08:46.237
No.

08:50.175 --> 08:52.377
(scoffs)

08:53.679 --> 08:56.731
LINDA:
<i>Just gonna feel a little stick.</i>

08:56.733 --> 08:57.682
Ready?

08:57.684 --> 08:58.883
BOY: Aah!
Okay.

08:58.885 --> 09:00.385
Thanks for seeing us, Linda.

09:00.387 --> 09:02.687
He's been so freaked out.
I knew you could keep him calm.

09:02.689 --> 09:05.356
Ah, you're doing
a pretty good job yourself.

09:05.358 --> 09:07.058
Where's Child Services?

09:07.060 --> 09:08.359
Oh, they're out
in the lobby.

09:08.361 --> 09:09.760
He screamed bloody murder
when they tried to take him.

09:09.762 --> 09:10.862
But someone's trying

09:10.864 --> 09:12.480
to locate his family,
right?

09:12.482 --> 09:14.065
Yeah, Vin took
a cell phone picture.

09:14.067 --> 09:16.234
He's canvassing the neighborhood
where we found him.

09:16.236 --> 09:17.235
Good.

09:17.237 --> 09:18.453
(boy sobs)

09:18.455 --> 09:20.989
Okay, bud.

09:20.991 --> 09:24.108
Well, here's another mystery
to add to this little guy.

09:24.110 --> 09:27.278
Oh.
The blood on his shirt?

09:28.280 --> 09:29.714
That's not his blood.

09:29.716 --> 09:31.666
Really.

09:31.668 --> 09:34.252
When I cleaned him up,
I didn't find a scratch

09:34.254 --> 09:36.838
or a cut on him, so I tested

09:36.840 --> 09:40.258
his blood and the blood
on the shirt.

09:40.260 --> 09:42.226
It's two different types.

09:42.228 --> 09:45.596
Got someone else's blood on him.
What's this kid seen?

09:45.598 --> 09:48.149
Try asking him.

09:48.151 --> 09:49.767
(boy sobs quietly)

09:49.769 --> 09:52.737
Hey, bud, let's try this
one more time, okay?

09:52.739 --> 09:54.689
Let's go. Okay, okay.
No. Don't put me down.

09:54.691 --> 09:56.607
It's okay.
You're all right.

09:56.609 --> 09:59.277
I'm just gonna put you
right here on the table.

09:59.279 --> 10:01.245
You're totally safe.

10:01.247 --> 10:02.246
Okay, I got you.

10:02.248 --> 10:04.532
Obviously,
somebody told you that

10:04.534 --> 10:05.666
if you ever had a problem,

10:05.668 --> 10:07.085
you should find
the nearest police officer.

10:07.087 --> 10:08.419
That's why you ran
up to me, right?

10:08.421 --> 10:12.924
Yeah? But I can't help you
solve it unless you talk to me.

10:12.926 --> 10:15.159
Okay, so you need
to be really brave.

10:15.161 --> 10:18.012
Told you that my name is Jamie.
What's your name?

10:19.264 --> 10:21.299
Kyle.

10:21.301 --> 10:24.268
Kyle. Okay.
That's a cool name.

10:24.270 --> 10:25.937
Nice to meet you, Kyle.

10:25.939 --> 10:29.440
Where do you live, bud?

10:38.150 --> 10:41.652
(footsteps approaching)

10:41.654 --> 10:44.072
What do you got?

10:44.074 --> 10:46.707
Ruth Collins, 80 years old.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.626
Shot in the middle
of eating lunch.

10:48.628 --> 10:49.860
I can see that much.

10:49.862 --> 10:52.046
She have enemies?
Anything? Any story?

10:52.048 --> 10:53.364
Not a one.

10:53.366 --> 10:54.999
Sweet little old lady,
wouldn't hurt a fly.

10:55.001 --> 10:56.834
Sort of like
our first victim, huh?

10:56.836 --> 10:58.586
As for the shooter...
As for the shooter--

10:58.588 --> 10:59.804
let me guess.

10:59.806 --> 11:01.139
Nobody saw anything.
No witnesses.

11:01.141 --> 11:03.007
He could be white, black,
tall, short...

11:03.009 --> 11:06.227
Actually, this time...
we have video.

11:11.150 --> 11:12.817
Okay, there's our guy.

11:14.886 --> 11:17.105
Judging by the height of that
door, I'd say he's about

11:17.107 --> 11:19.824
six foot, give or take.

11:19.826 --> 11:22.326
Take that hood off, come on.

11:22.328 --> 11:25.530
On a mission,
as calm as can be.

11:25.532 --> 11:27.248
Or calm as a cucumber.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.866
Exactly.

11:28.868 --> 11:31.335
BAEZ:
Right-handed.

11:31.337 --> 11:33.121
Looks like a revolver.

11:33.123 --> 11:34.755
Come on, show us something,

11:34.757 --> 11:36.740
you son of a bitch.

11:38.460 --> 11:39.560
He just shoots

11:39.562 --> 11:42.046
the poor old lady
like it's nothing.

11:44.016 --> 11:46.134
Nothing.

11:46.136 --> 11:47.718
(gasping)

11:47.720 --> 11:49.053
All right, let me guess,

11:49.055 --> 11:50.421
none of you
saw anything, huh?

11:53.609 --> 11:56.277
Something you want
to say, ma'am?

11:58.030 --> 11:59.530
Ma'am?

11:59.532 --> 12:00.865
Whoa! Whoa!

12:00.867 --> 12:01.983
Huh... hold on, ma'am.

12:01.985 --> 12:05.203
Something you want
to talk to us about?

12:05.205 --> 12:06.937
Well, yes.

12:06.939 --> 12:09.940
I didn't want to say anything
in front of everyone else,

12:09.942 --> 12:12.376
'cause they liked Ruth so much.

12:12.378 --> 12:14.328
Uh-huh.
But she was part of

12:14.330 --> 12:17.131
my sewing circle,
and-and sometimes

12:17.133 --> 12:19.217
she would take a nip

12:19.219 --> 12:22.386
from that apple brandy
bottle she had.

12:22.388 --> 12:24.005
Mm-hmm.
And one night,

12:24.007 --> 12:25.590
a-a while back,
she told me

12:25.592 --> 12:27.124
she had a secret.

12:27.126 --> 12:28.426
Which was...?

12:29.311 --> 12:32.897
Ruth told me she killed someone.

12:37.152 --> 12:39.403
(sighs)

12:48.361 --> 12:49.962
FRANK:
<i>That's it</i>

12:49.964 --> 12:52.014
for today.

12:52.016 --> 12:55.184
Be careful out there.

12:55.186 --> 12:57.419
Regarding the possible
serial shootings,

12:57.421 --> 13:00.789
the first victim was shot
last night, in Times Square,

13:00.791 --> 13:03.425
the second one,
this morning, in the Bronx.

13:03.427 --> 13:06.011
CNN is asking for a
one-on-one with you.

13:06.013 --> 13:06.775
That would look like

13:06.776 --> 13:08.577
I'm bigfooting
my son's investigation.

13:08.579 --> 13:09.878
I don't think so.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.463
On the inter-office front,

13:11.465 --> 13:13.781
you have a dirty bomb
tabletop at 4:30.

13:13.783 --> 13:15.116
Briefing's on your desk.

13:15.118 --> 13:17.335
And I also saw Baker's
e-mail with that list

13:17.337 --> 13:19.170
of CEOs and board chairmen

13:19.172 --> 13:20.672
and their available
interview times.

13:20.674 --> 13:21.673
And?

13:21.675 --> 13:22.674
Did I somehow miss

13:22.676 --> 13:24.309
the announcement
of your retirement?

13:24.311 --> 13:25.894
Or did you find an extra
hour in your day

13:25.896 --> 13:27.095
to take on a second job?

13:27.097 --> 13:31.066
Boy, I can't get
anything past you.

13:31.068 --> 13:32.734
Sir, your 4:00 is here.

13:32.736 --> 13:33.852
Good.

13:34.737 --> 13:36.488
You know, the first thing

13:36.490 --> 13:37.489
I ever taught your boss?

13:37.491 --> 13:39.140
Always keep
a beautiful woman nearby.

13:39.142 --> 13:40.308
I'm glad to see

13:40.310 --> 13:41.660
he hasn't forgotten.

13:42.361 --> 13:43.778
Garrett Moore,

13:43.780 --> 13:44.913
Colonel Pete Seabrook.

13:44.915 --> 13:46.164
The <i>Endeavor.</i>

13:46.166 --> 13:47.532
What about it?

13:47.534 --> 13:49.250
The only space shuttle
you never got to fly.

13:49.252 --> 13:50.585
I was back-up pilot

13:50.587 --> 13:51.586
on her first mission.

13:51.588 --> 13:53.455
Can I ask you something?

13:53.457 --> 13:54.422
Yeah. What's that?

13:54.424 --> 13:55.457
How do you go

13:55.459 --> 13:56.675
to the bathroom up there?

13:58.878 --> 14:00.629
Aren't you late for anything?

14:00.631 --> 14:03.014
Honor to meet you, Colonel.
Thank you.

14:03.933 --> 14:06.384
Don't do that to my people.

14:06.386 --> 14:08.186
Baker's not a cocktail waitress

14:08.188 --> 14:09.554
in Cocoa Beach,

14:09.556 --> 14:11.723
she's an NYPD Detective.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.024
I'm sorry.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.309
Besides, she's got

14:14.311 --> 14:16.010
the Medal For Valor,
you don't want to piss her off.

14:16.012 --> 14:18.613
You know I always
put my foot in it.

14:18.615 --> 14:20.031
I made a few calls,

14:20.033 --> 14:22.117
now they're expecting yours.

14:23.819 --> 14:24.819
I'm...

14:24.821 --> 14:26.354
I really appreciate this, Frank.

14:26.356 --> 14:27.855
Good.

14:27.857 --> 14:29.991
Now tell me what
happened with Amy.

14:32.411 --> 14:34.862
Boy, you never stop
being a cop, do you?

14:34.864 --> 14:36.665
Well, I had to do a bio, Pete.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.750
You've been divorced
for two years.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.001
Unemployed. Divorced.

14:40.003 --> 14:42.470
How many screw-ups do I have
to admit to in one day?

14:42.472 --> 14:43.471
I mean...

14:43.473 --> 14:45.757
And I never
saw this one coming.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.208
I know I'm not the world's
greatest husband,

14:47.210 --> 14:50.178
but just, all of the sudden,
one day, out of nowhere,

14:50.180 --> 14:52.430
she just says, "We're done."

14:52.432 --> 14:53.431
That's it."

14:53.433 --> 14:54.516
Serves me with papers

14:54.518 --> 14:55.934
and moves out.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.686
Took Heather with her.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.188
I don't see you giving up.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.406
They're my family, Frank.

15:01.408 --> 15:03.108
If anyone should
get that, it's you.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.492
And-and actually, I mean,

15:04.494 --> 15:05.893
things are going
a little better.

15:05.895 --> 15:08.113
I'm talking to them
all the time,

15:08.115 --> 15:09.531
and that-that's
the only reason I think that

15:09.533 --> 15:12.367
if I could land one of these
jobs in New York,

15:12.369 --> 15:14.836
and just get them out here
from Houston, I don't know,

15:14.838 --> 15:16.121
maybe we'll have a...

15:16.123 --> 15:19.457
a real shot at a fresh start.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.678
Look...

15:23.680 --> 15:26.431
I'm sorry I wasn't up-front
with you about this.

15:28.718 --> 15:31.052
Well, we all have our secrets.

15:32.605 --> 15:34.272
Want to know the real reason

15:34.274 --> 15:35.857
I didn't go to flight school?

15:35.859 --> 15:37.108
(sighs)

15:37.110 --> 15:39.427
I'm afraid of flying.

15:39.429 --> 15:42.930
Never stopped me.

15:45.367 --> 15:46.868
A killer named Ruth Collins?

15:46.870 --> 15:50.121
Yes, Ruth Collins, arrested
for murder in 2002, but...

15:50.123 --> 15:51.606
she was prosecuted
in this office.

15:51.608 --> 15:52.707
I'm pretty sure
it was your old buddy,

15:52.709 --> 15:53.742
Trevor Holt.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.776
You think he'll talk to me?

15:54.778 --> 15:56.327
No, but he'll talk to me.

15:56.329 --> 15:58.780
Okay, do you think you can
get him to talk to me?

15:58.782 --> 16:01.716
Danny, you're not exactly
a people person.

16:01.718 --> 16:02.751
You know,
and he likes me.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.502
He recruited me
out of law school.

16:04.504 --> 16:05.920
Yeah.
He's been a mentor to me.

16:05.922 --> 16:08.807
Ok, how about when he talks
to you, I sit in?

16:08.809 --> 16:11.092
Will you behave yourself?

16:11.094 --> 16:12.293
Yes.

16:14.463 --> 16:16.815
Mrs. Hilberg, listen to me!

16:16.817 --> 16:18.900
If you don't testify
against Tommy Vasquez

16:18.902 --> 16:20.018
and he walks free,

16:20.020 --> 16:22.737
even more people
are gonna get seriously hurt.

16:24.156 --> 16:25.440
Mrs. Hilberg...

16:25.442 --> 16:27.108
Hello?

16:28.977 --> 16:30.161
Is everything all right?

16:30.163 --> 16:32.514
Lost a witness
against that food truck guy

16:32.516 --> 16:34.165
dealing drugs in Monroe Park.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.617
Anyway...

16:35.619 --> 16:36.835
where you been all week?

16:36.837 --> 16:39.204
Chinatown,
interviewing witnesses.

16:39.206 --> 16:40.505
Which means I was

16:40.507 --> 16:42.791
near Lin Cho's, and I picked up
your favorite tea.

16:42.793 --> 16:43.958
(softly):
Oh.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.326
Erin...

16:45.328 --> 16:47.712
you are gonna put my wife
out of business.

16:47.714 --> 16:48.963
Oh!

16:48.965 --> 16:51.216
(laughs)

16:52.167 --> 16:54.302
Oh, this is my
brother Danny.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.521
Danny, nice to finally
cross paths.

16:56.523 --> 16:58.506
You, too.
Danny was wondering if you

16:58.508 --> 17:01.192
remembered a woman
named Ruth Collins.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.277
Sure.

17:02.279 --> 17:03.228
She's a cold-blooded killer.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.196
Yeah, she <i>was</i>
a cold-blooded killer.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.648
She was murdered this morning.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.016
Oh.

17:09.018 --> 17:10.034
So, you tried the case?

17:10.036 --> 17:11.685
I would've, if the grand jury

17:11.688 --> 17:12.904
would've indicted her.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.656
Ruth was a slumlord.

17:14.657 --> 17:17.325
She had a rent dispute
with one of her tenants.

17:17.327 --> 17:20.662
A disabled tenant named Joan.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.630
Mm-hmm.
Joan threatened to sue,

17:22.632 --> 17:24.299
so Ruth ran her over with a car.

17:24.300 --> 17:27.001
Then she backed up
and ran over her again.

17:27.002 --> 17:29.087
How did the grand jury
not see it?

17:29.089 --> 17:30.672
Oh, Ruth put up an act.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.091
She played the sweet little old
lady who wouldn't hurt a fly.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.876
She doddered up to the stand,

17:34.878 --> 17:37.428
then she sobbed about how foggy
she was that day

17:37.430 --> 17:38.980
because her medications
got all mixed up.

17:38.982 --> 17:40.715
Do you know of anybody
who was angry

17:40.717 --> 17:42.984
that she, uh,
didn't end up in jail?

17:42.986 --> 17:45.103
Joan's son, Kenneth.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.155
He said he was gonna
get even with her,

17:47.157 --> 17:48.323
with the DA's Office,

17:48.325 --> 17:49.574
even members of the grand jury.

17:49.576 --> 17:51.526
And?

17:51.528 --> 17:53.111
And nothing.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.580
I figured he just cooled off
as time went by.

17:55.582 --> 17:57.282
Yeah, or maybe he just waited

17:57.284 --> 17:59.901
for the right time to strike.

18:02.121 --> 18:04.505
(sighs)

18:07.459 --> 18:08.760
MAN:
<i>Please...</i>

18:08.762 --> 18:11.262
tell us our boy is okay.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.680
Yeah, Kyle is fine.

18:12.682 --> 18:14.415
(sighs)
But when I found him,

18:14.417 --> 18:15.550
he was out on the street alone,

18:15.552 --> 18:16.935
with a bloody shirt
and no coat on,

18:16.937 --> 18:18.353
so he's not
coming back until

18:18.355 --> 18:20.755
I'm confident this is
a safe place for him to be.

18:20.757 --> 18:22.857
It is, we promise.

18:22.859 --> 18:24.275
Mm-hmm.

18:25.527 --> 18:27.094
When did you first realize
that he was gone?

18:27.096 --> 18:30.698
About an hour after
I put him in his room.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.100
Uh, we went crazy
looking for him.

18:33.102 --> 18:34.769
ask any of our neighbors.

18:34.771 --> 18:36.437
But you didn't call the police.

18:36.439 --> 18:39.324
We were embarrassed
that he ran away.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.575
You realize it was
because he heard

18:40.577 --> 18:41.576
you two fighting, right?

18:41.578 --> 18:42.911
Kyle gets scared

18:42.913 --> 18:45.112
when anyone raises their voice.

18:45.114 --> 18:46.130
Mm-hmm.
Which you should've remembered

18:46.132 --> 18:47.799
before you started
yelling at me.

18:47.801 --> 18:49.617
Baby, you yelled at me first.

18:49.619 --> 18:50.885
What? No, I didn't.

18:50.887 --> 18:52.136
Uh-uh-uh, all right.

18:52.138 --> 18:53.788
Okay,

18:53.790 --> 18:55.139
what was the fight about?

18:55.141 --> 18:56.474
(exhales)

18:56.476 --> 18:58.927
It was... it was nothing.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.678
It was silly.
And we shouldn't have

19:00.680 --> 19:01.763
yelled in front of Kyle.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.181
That was our mistake,
Officer.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.517
Is that how he got blood
on his shirt?

19:08.938 --> 19:10.855
I dropped a glass.

19:10.857 --> 19:12.690
I didn't throw it, I swear.

19:12.692 --> 19:14.776
Mm-hmm.
Kyle wanted to help me

19:14.778 --> 19:16.027
when he saw me bleeding,

19:16.029 --> 19:18.145
but there was pieces
on the ground,

19:18.147 --> 19:19.781
so I... I picked him up

19:19.783 --> 19:22.533
and I-I put him
in his room.

19:22.535 --> 19:26.337
Please, our boy
means everything to us.

19:27.990 --> 19:29.324
Can he come home now?

19:35.264 --> 19:37.098
Yeah.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.716
Hey, Vin, bring him in.

19:42.337 --> 19:43.771
Mom. Dad.

19:43.773 --> 19:45.273
Little man.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.361
(mother cries quietly)

19:54.366 --> 19:56.034
DANNY:
<i>Start talking, Kenneth.</i>

19:56.036 --> 19:57.118
KENNETH:
<i>Okay!</i>

19:57.120 --> 19:58.369
Okay what?
Okay.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.455
Okay what?!
I did it.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.189
That didn't take long.

20:02.191 --> 20:03.458
All right, I shouldn't have,

20:03.460 --> 20:04.709
but I did.

20:04.711 --> 20:05.860
Why don't you lay it
all out for us, Kenneth.

20:05.862 --> 20:06.861
How'd it go down?

20:06.863 --> 20:09.047
The drugs made me do it.

20:09.049 --> 20:10.465
So you're a junkie.

20:10.467 --> 20:12.884
I'm not proud of it.

20:12.886 --> 20:15.053
I steered clear of dope
my whole life.

20:15.055 --> 20:16.804
Wasn't easy,
but I stayed clean

20:16.806 --> 20:18.539
for my mama.

20:18.541 --> 20:20.425
Until she was killed
by Ruth Collins.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.176
That bitch ran her down

20:22.178 --> 20:24.729
and then convinced the world
that she didn't.

20:24.731 --> 20:26.981
Look, we understand
why you wanted revenge

20:26.983 --> 20:28.316
on Ruth Collins, Kenneth.

20:28.318 --> 20:29.567
We do.

20:29.569 --> 20:31.769
But why go kill
Martin Cahill, also?

20:31.771 --> 20:34.739
Wait... Ruth is dead?

20:34.741 --> 20:35.773
DANNY:
Of course she's dead.

20:35.775 --> 20:36.824
I mean, you just
confessed to it.

20:36.826 --> 20:37.909
You said the drugs

20:37.911 --> 20:39.060
made you do it.

20:39.062 --> 20:40.411
No, I meant I broke

20:40.413 --> 20:41.996
into that dude's apartment.

20:41.998 --> 20:43.364
Martin Cahill's apartment?

20:43.366 --> 20:44.999
I don't know anyone
named Martin Cahill.

20:45.001 --> 20:47.401
I'm talking about the guy
in my building-- Larry.

20:48.370 --> 20:50.338
I stole his computer
to sell it for dope.

20:50.340 --> 20:51.589
That's why I ran away from you.

20:51.591 --> 20:53.574
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't start lying to us now.

20:53.576 --> 20:54.876
Well, I...
Okay?

20:54.878 --> 20:55.877
'Cause you killed Ruth Collins

20:55.879 --> 20:57.462
and you killed Martin Cahill.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.763
But I didn't.

20:58.765 --> 21:00.014
I mean, I wanted to kill

21:00.016 --> 21:01.966
Ruth Collins years ago, but...

21:01.968 --> 21:03.718
Detectives, outside.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.137
Little bit busy
with a suspect here, Sarge.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.271
Except he's not.

21:07.273 --> 21:08.356
Your shooter

21:08.358 --> 21:09.640
just struck again.

21:11.643 --> 21:13.260
(sighs)

21:34.669 --> 21:36.304
He's all yours.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.053
Son of a bitch.

21:38.055 --> 21:40.972
So, a guy doing Tai Chi

21:40.974 --> 21:42.474
said he saw the
jogger arrive

21:42.476 --> 21:43.808
and start warming up.

21:43.810 --> 21:45.510
And let me guess,
guy in a parka

21:45.512 --> 21:47.178
comes walking up,
two shots on the jogger

21:47.180 --> 21:48.229
and he walks away?

21:48.231 --> 21:50.348
Yeah, the song remains
the same, you know?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.516
(sighs):
Yeah, except this time,

21:51.518 --> 21:52.901
we got even less on the vic.

21:52.903 --> 21:54.869
We got no wallet,
we got no house keys,

21:54.871 --> 21:56.071
we don't even got an iPod

21:56.073 --> 21:58.323
to know if he listens
to show tunes or speed metal.

21:58.325 --> 22:00.692
Danny, we need an I.D. to
see if there's a pattern.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.028
I-Is this guy a saint,
like the first victim,

22:03.030 --> 22:04.529
or a killer like the second?

22:04.531 --> 22:06.698
This tai chi guy--
he say if he saw

22:06.700 --> 22:08.583
which way the jogger
was coming from?

22:08.585 --> 22:10.535
Yeah, he said he approached
from the north.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.170
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna grab a couple guys,

22:12.172 --> 22:14.072
go canvas that way.
Head to the M.E.'s office

22:14.074 --> 22:15.957
and camp out there
and do not leave until you get

22:15.959 --> 22:18.293
an I.D. on this stiff, okay?
All right.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.095
Call me as soon as you hear.

22:20.097 --> 22:23.381
Anybody want to go
on a wild goose chase with me?

22:31.307 --> 22:33.308
Another body dropped.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.426
So that makes three.

22:35.428 --> 22:37.112
You know, I'm impressed
by your math, Sis.

22:37.114 --> 22:38.813
Yes, three and counting.

22:38.815 --> 22:39.864
Don't worry.
You'll solve the case.

22:39.866 --> 22:42.767
(phone rings)

22:42.769 --> 22:44.769
What do you got for me, Baez?

22:44.771 --> 22:46.654
All right.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.289
Ah, great. Yeah.

22:48.291 --> 22:50.291
Good news?
Maybe.

22:50.293 --> 22:52.911
We got an I.D. on our dead
jogger: one Eddie DeLuca.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.329
Which means I got to go, Sis.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.914
PETE: Let me tell
you something,

22:55.916 --> 22:57.615
when those solid rockets

22:57.617 --> 22:59.334
light up, you don't know
where you're going.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.835
I mean, you know
you're going somewhere.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.954
(laughs)

23:02.956 --> 23:04.839
But you don't know, and I'm
telling you something else--

23:04.841 --> 23:07.008
people are talking about
the wild blue yonder,

23:07.010 --> 23:10.011
they don't know-- it's black.
It's as black as your shirt.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.012
Colonel Seabrook?

23:11.014 --> 23:13.314
Ye... Ye...

23:13.316 --> 23:15.850
Erin Reagan. You know my father.
Hey.

23:15.852 --> 23:19.988
You got to be kidding me!

23:19.990 --> 23:22.607
Erin Reagan!
What are you doing in New York?

23:22.609 --> 23:24.475
Well, you know,
I'm just taking a...

23:24.477 --> 23:26.745
what the PR people
call a victory lap.

23:26.747 --> 23:28.780
You know,
shoot a few pictures,

23:28.782 --> 23:31.315
shake a few hands, but...
Do you realize

23:31.317 --> 23:33.701
the last time I saw you was when

23:33.703 --> 23:35.754
your family came down
to the Cape

23:35.756 --> 23:38.339
to see <i>Atlantis</i> go up?
Yeah, it was

23:38.341 --> 23:41.760
a long time ago. Still, it was
the coolest thing I ever saw.

23:41.762 --> 23:43.161
Aw.

23:43.163 --> 23:44.429
So, Dad know you're in town?

23:44.431 --> 23:46.014
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:46.016 --> 23:47.932
Yeah, as a matter of fact, um,

23:47.934 --> 23:50.518
he's gonna join me for a drink
in-in, uh, just a little bit.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.437
Okay, well, you two
stay out of trouble.

23:52.439 --> 23:54.222
Okay. You take care.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.307
Okay.
Yeah.

23:59.895 --> 24:01.896
JAMIE: Hey, Linda.
Hey.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.115
Take something to the table for you?
Um...

24:04.117 --> 24:06.117
napkins. Over there.

24:07.036 --> 24:09.687
Jamie, since I don't get to ask,

24:09.689 --> 24:12.123
what happened when you took that
little guy home the other day?

24:12.125 --> 24:13.191
Was everything okay?

24:13.193 --> 24:15.243
Yeah, turns out his parents
were just arguing.

24:15.245 --> 24:18.046
His dad accidentally
got blood on Kyle's shirt.

24:18.048 --> 24:20.415
I need butter.
Would you grab it?

24:20.417 --> 24:23.051
But you're talking about,
like, his stepfather, right?

24:23.053 --> 24:24.535
Or his foster father?

24:24.537 --> 24:26.171
Um, no, Raul's his dad.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.590
I saw, um,
baby pictures with him.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.009
Why?

24:31.011 --> 24:32.894
Uh, Jamie,
the blood that I tested

24:32.896 --> 24:36.547
from the shirt and from Kyle,
those were types AB and O.

24:36.549 --> 24:38.883
That's incompatible
for a father and son.

24:38.885 --> 24:41.486
What are you saying?
I'm saying

24:41.488 --> 24:43.771
this guy Raul,

24:43.773 --> 24:46.441
he can't be Kyle's
biological father.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.247
DANNY:
<i>All I know</i>

24:52.249 --> 24:53.832
is the bodies keep piling up,

24:53.834 --> 24:56.034
and I feel like I'm
running around in circles.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.785
FRANK: Well, do what
we were trained to do--

24:57.787 --> 24:59.037
go back to the beginning.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.205
Is it random?

25:00.207 --> 25:01.923
I don't know.
If it's premeditated,

25:01.925 --> 25:04.742
there's a motive.
If it's random...

25:04.744 --> 25:06.544
let's just hope it's not.

25:06.546 --> 25:07.795
Right.

25:07.797 --> 25:10.548
Nothing scares a cop more
than a nut who keeps

25:10.550 --> 25:12.934
killing people for no reason.
LINDA: Okay.

25:12.936 --> 25:15.770
Can we try not to scare
everybody around here?

25:15.772 --> 25:16.938
ERIN:
What'd you learn about

25:16.940 --> 25:18.640
that jogger yesterday?
DANNY: That he got

25:18.642 --> 25:20.692
a murder rap,
same as victim number two.

25:20.694 --> 25:23.645
Could be a vigilante.

25:25.097 --> 25:26.698
Or karma's getting them.

25:26.700 --> 25:27.815
Who's karma?

25:27.817 --> 25:29.200
JACK:
Karma's a what,

25:29.202 --> 25:30.201
not a who.

25:30.203 --> 25:31.202
Okay then, what's karma?

25:31.204 --> 25:32.620
NICKY:
It's this idea

25:32.622 --> 25:35.373
from Eastern religions that
what goes around comes around.

25:35.375 --> 25:37.325
The Bible says
something similar.

25:37.327 --> 25:40.128
Well, maybe someone's trying
to speed up the process.

25:40.130 --> 25:42.463
DANNY: Look, the theory
of a vigilante

25:42.465 --> 25:46.167
or karma sound great, but...
what about victim number one,

25:46.169 --> 25:48.169
who was apparently a saint?

25:48.171 --> 25:50.454
So if there's a pattern,
you're not seeing it.

25:50.456 --> 25:52.257
Exactly. And around
And around

25:52.259 --> 25:53.675
and around and around.
and around and around.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.677
Find the motive.
Even if it's just the voices

25:55.679 --> 25:57.679
rattling around
your shooter's head.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.297
NICKY:
Don't worry, Uncle Danny.

25:59.299 --> 26:00.899
You'll get this guy.

26:00.901 --> 26:03.151
Yeah, not like you don't have any
experience with crazy people.

26:03.153 --> 26:05.136
You grew up in a house
full of 'em.

26:05.138 --> 26:06.821
(scattered, quiet chuckling)

26:12.828 --> 26:14.162
Show 'em.

26:14.164 --> 26:16.981
Three jacks.

26:16.983 --> 26:18.950
Whoo.
That certainly beats

26:18.952 --> 26:20.318
my three tens.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.819
Mm-hmm.

26:21.821 --> 26:23.254
Lucky for me,
I got a pair of aces

26:23.256 --> 26:24.706
to go with.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.257
Grandpa...
(laughing)

26:27.459 --> 26:28.676
FRANK:
Oh...

26:28.678 --> 26:30.428
Then let's double the ante.

26:30.430 --> 26:31.596
Ooh.
Ooh. Ooh.

26:31.598 --> 26:34.549
Yes, ma'am.
Here you go.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.100
So, did Pete tell you?

26:36.102 --> 26:38.303
Tell me what?

26:38.305 --> 26:41.105
I bumped into him last night
at McDerry's.

26:42.274 --> 26:43.641
Looked like he'd had a few.

26:43.643 --> 26:46.027
I didn't go to McDerry's
last night.

26:46.029 --> 26:49.564
He said that you were meeting
him for a drink.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.984
He never called. I never went.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.203
The way I remember him,

26:55.205 --> 26:59.357
he was ten feet tall,
riding a rocket into space.

27:00.876 --> 27:02.460
Last night, he just

27:02.462 --> 27:04.128
looked like...

27:04.130 --> 27:06.864
a guy drinking alone in a bar.

27:19.544 --> 27:21.545
Hey.
Officer.

27:21.547 --> 27:23.014
Evening. Do you have a moment?

27:23.016 --> 27:25.433
Well, Raul's not here.
He took Kyle to the store.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.986
That's okay.
I want to talk to you.

27:27.988 --> 27:31.272
I just need
to turn down the stove.

27:33.075 --> 27:34.558
Is something wrong?

27:35.394 --> 27:37.328
No, uh...

27:37.330 --> 27:39.664
I wanted to, uh...

27:39.666 --> 27:42.583
talk to you
about Kyle's father.

27:44.086 --> 27:46.537
I know it's not Raul.

27:46.539 --> 27:49.340
What? Of course he's his father.

27:49.342 --> 27:50.842
But that's impossible.

27:50.844 --> 27:52.927
Kyle's blood type couldn't
come from your husband's.

27:52.929 --> 27:54.929
This is none of your business.
Okay,

27:54.931 --> 27:57.215
your son ran up to me on the street
because I'm a police officer.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.633
That makes it my business.

27:58.635 --> 28:01.969
Look, I see domestic situations
turn bad all the time.

28:01.971 --> 28:05.023
If the truth comes out
in the wrong way,

28:05.025 --> 28:06.941
your husband can't deal with it,

28:06.943 --> 28:09.444
Kyle's the one who ends up
getting hurt. Is that...

28:09.446 --> 28:12.980
is that something you want?
Something you want to happen?

28:12.982 --> 28:15.366
No.

28:16.601 --> 28:18.870
The fight that Raul and I had,

28:18.872 --> 28:22.440
it was about this guy, Ted.
He drops by sometimes.

28:23.826 --> 28:27.278
Ted's a plumber, so I say
he's just here to fix things.

28:27.280 --> 28:30.381
He's really coming
to see his son.

28:30.383 --> 28:32.750
How do I tell my husband

28:32.752 --> 28:36.254
that he's not the father
of our child?

28:36.256 --> 28:38.139
RAUL:
I knew it.

28:38.141 --> 28:39.757
It's him, isn't it?

28:39.759 --> 28:41.676
(sobs)
It's that punk Ted?

28:41.678 --> 28:43.627
And you said I was crazy
for thinking that?!

28:43.629 --> 28:45.229
Baby, please, let me explain!

28:45.231 --> 28:46.464
You bitch!

28:46.466 --> 28:48.066
Hey! Hey, hey! Hey!

28:48.068 --> 28:48.983
VICKY:
Baby!

28:48.985 --> 28:50.401
Go to hell!

28:50.403 --> 28:52.520
Raul!
Dad!

28:52.522 --> 28:54.489
Please!
All right, all right. Okay.

28:54.491 --> 28:58.409
(crying)
Hey, it's okay.

29:24.770 --> 29:26.938
(sighs)

29:35.230 --> 29:37.231
Hello, Frank.

29:37.233 --> 29:39.683
Hello.

29:40.536 --> 29:42.870
Can I get you anything?

29:42.872 --> 29:45.740
No, thanks, I'm good.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.241
What's going on?

29:47.243 --> 29:50.545
Amy...

29:50.547 --> 29:53.464
you didn't know
he was in New York?

29:53.466 --> 29:55.249
No.

29:55.251 --> 29:57.468
(sighs)

29:57.470 --> 29:59.971
He asked me to help him
find a job,

29:59.973 --> 30:02.757
so he could move you and Heather
from Houston.

30:02.759 --> 30:05.059
Uh, forgive me,

30:05.061 --> 30:09.230
I'm... a little behind here.
Frank, there's reality

30:09.232 --> 30:11.265
and then there's Pete's version.

30:11.267 --> 30:14.068
(sighs)
How far apart are they?

30:14.070 --> 30:16.020
I don't know what he told you.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.856
He divorced me
almost three years ago.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.325
(sighs)

30:21.327 --> 30:24.946
He told me you left him.
Like I say,

30:24.948 --> 30:27.365
there's reality
and then there's...

30:27.367 --> 30:29.116
(sighs)

30:29.118 --> 30:31.002
He's lost.

30:31.837 --> 30:34.372
Started a while back.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.507
The shuttle program
was ending,

30:36.509 --> 30:39.126
he was retiring from the Corps.

30:39.128 --> 30:42.597
The brass bands
kind of just... stopped.

30:42.599 --> 30:44.465
I don't think he knew

30:44.467 --> 30:46.517
who he was supposed
to be anymore.

30:46.519 --> 30:49.353
"Is that all there is?"

30:49.355 --> 30:53.257
It's not an easy
question to answer.

30:53.259 --> 30:55.893
He started drinking more

30:55.895 --> 30:58.112
d talking less.

30:58.114 --> 30:59.947
One day Heather
and I came home

30:59.949 --> 31:01.983
to find divorce papers
on the coffee table

31:01.985 --> 31:04.068
and his stuff packed and gone.

31:05.770 --> 31:07.989
Heather's still mad about it.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.241
And you?

31:12.628 --> 31:15.463
More sad than mad by now.

31:16.948 --> 31:20.284
I only moved up here
because I couldn't stand living

31:20.286 --> 31:23.421
in the same city
and never hearing from him.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.640
All he ever talks about
is the two of you

31:25.642 --> 31:26.957
getting back together.

31:26.959 --> 31:30.394
Then why not pick up
the damn phone?

31:32.898 --> 31:35.066
He's a proud man.

31:40.739 --> 31:42.206
Thank you. I'll get right on it.

31:42.231 --> 31:43.792
WOMAN: I'll pick you up
tonight, Trevor.

31:47.162 --> 31:49.697
I love you.
TREVOR: Bye, honey.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.035
Gail!

31:54.037 --> 31:55.453
What are you doing here?

31:56.321 --> 31:58.589
I gave Trevor a ride in.

31:58.591 --> 32:01.092
Well, it's been ages.
How are you doing?

32:01.877 --> 32:05.179
Okay,
under the circumstances.

32:07.599 --> 32:10.501
I-I thought if he'd tell anyone,
it would be you.

32:10.503 --> 32:12.603
Tell me what?

32:14.056 --> 32:16.006
A couple months ago,

32:16.008 --> 32:19.009
Trevor had to go to the E.R.
in the middle of the night.

32:19.011 --> 32:21.946
What?
We thought it was food poisoning.

32:21.948 --> 32:24.682
But it wasn't.

32:24.684 --> 32:26.517
Trevor's sick?

32:27.319 --> 32:29.570
Very.

32:30.405 --> 32:32.623
Oh, Gail.

32:35.544 --> 32:38.579
Hey. Got your message.
What's up?

32:38.581 --> 32:40.715
Can you close the door?

32:40.717 --> 32:42.967
Okay.

32:42.969 --> 32:45.670
I don't know how to say this.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.171
Well, why don't you just say it?
'Cause you're kind of

32:47.173 --> 32:48.673
freaking me out
a little bit here.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.558
The guy you're looking for, I...

32:50.560 --> 32:52.893
I think it could be Trevor Holt.

32:52.895 --> 32:54.929
You're joking, right?
I wish I were,

32:54.931 --> 32:57.181
and I would like you to talk me
out of it, but the more

32:57.183 --> 32:59.400
I think about it, the more
it's making sense to me.

32:59.402 --> 33:01.051
The other day,

33:01.053 --> 33:03.387
Trevor said he had
Ruth Collins' case, right?

33:03.389 --> 33:04.772
Yeah.
Did you know

33:04.774 --> 33:08.859
he also prosecuted
your third victim, Eddie DeLuca?

33:08.861 --> 33:11.662
Eddie DeLuca. He did three years
for manslaughter.

33:11.664 --> 33:14.281
So, other than Holt being
the prosecutor in both cases,

33:14.283 --> 33:17.568
I don't really see
a connection here, Sis.

33:17.570 --> 33:19.453
Eddie DeLuca should have
done life for murder.

33:19.455 --> 33:21.872
So, he basically skated,
just like Collins.

33:21.874 --> 33:24.508
Wha-Wha-What's gotten into you
that you're suddenly

33:24.510 --> 33:26.910
running around, playing cop,
digging through files, hmm?

33:26.912 --> 33:29.714
All right, I know. It just...
it wasn't adding up, okay?

33:29.716 --> 33:32.133
And it didn't occur
to me on the day,

33:32.135 --> 33:34.018
but do you remember
when Trevor was yelling

33:34.020 --> 33:36.103
and getting all pissed off that

33:36.105 --> 33:37.355
he lost the witness?

33:37.357 --> 33:38.723
I would have done
the same thing. So what?

33:38.725 --> 33:40.558
Right, exactly.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.259
That's not the Trevor I know.

33:42.261 --> 33:45.262
From day one, he taught me
not to get mad.

33:45.264 --> 33:47.765
That getting mad would take
your eye off the ball,

33:47.767 --> 33:49.400
and the real point is justice.

33:49.402 --> 33:52.036
Sis, the guy was in a bad mood.

33:52.038 --> 33:53.454
He got mad. So what?

33:53.456 --> 33:54.605
It doesn't make him a killer.

33:54.607 --> 33:55.956
You get mad
all the time yourself!

33:55.958 --> 33:58.242
I'm not saying
that I learned the lesson well.

33:58.244 --> 34:00.211
This is why I admire the man.

34:00.213 --> 34:03.781
His ability to
stay focused, and

34:03.783 --> 34:05.282
keep his emotions in check.

34:05.284 --> 34:07.385
I mean, this guy gave up
having kids

34:07.387 --> 34:09.637
to devote his life to the law.

34:09.639 --> 34:13.641
Right. And he's gonna jeopardize
everything he's worked for

34:13.643 --> 34:16.761
to run around,
playing vigilante?

34:16.763 --> 34:18.295
Why?

34:18.297 --> 34:20.598
Because he's running
out of time.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.849
What?

34:21.851 --> 34:23.818
He's dying.

34:23.820 --> 34:26.987
Pancreatic cancer, inoperable.

34:26.989 --> 34:30.274
And maybe it's
making him crazy.

34:30.275 --> 34:33.143
And maybe I am crazy
for suggesting this.

34:34.446 --> 34:38.748
I think killing these people
is his bucket list.

34:59.607 --> 35:01.792
Frank?

35:01.794 --> 35:03.961
Sit down.

35:09.133 --> 35:11.235
Uh, you're not drinking?

35:11.237 --> 35:12.686
No.

35:12.688 --> 35:15.739
Cheers.

35:27.118 --> 35:29.403
(sighs)

35:29.405 --> 35:31.705
I didn't want
to break your rhythm.

35:33.758 --> 35:37.044
You, uh... think I got
an issue with booze?

35:37.046 --> 35:39.329
You've always had issues.

35:39.331 --> 35:42.049
Now you have a problem.

35:42.051 --> 35:44.935
I'm sorry.

35:44.937 --> 35:47.137
Sorry you lied,
sorry you got caught,

35:47.139 --> 35:49.890
or sorry you're a drunk?

35:51.776 --> 35:53.861
Um, just...

35:53.863 --> 35:55.946
sorry, okay?

35:55.948 --> 35:58.282
I'm not your counselor.
I'm your friend.

35:58.284 --> 36:00.901
Don't lie to me,

36:00.903 --> 36:05.656
or expect me to believe the lies
you tell about yourself.

36:05.658 --> 36:08.625
Okay, what are you saying,
Frank?

36:08.627 --> 36:11.795
You're a good man.

36:11.797 --> 36:14.197
And who you are...

36:14.199 --> 36:17.301
is a lot more important
than what you do.

36:23.091 --> 36:25.309
Those jobs--
they're there for you.

36:25.311 --> 36:30.264
But you need to reach out
to Amy and Heather first.

36:30.266 --> 36:35.652
Frank, that ship has sailed.

36:35.654 --> 36:37.604
Not according to them.

36:37.606 --> 36:39.356
How would you know?

36:39.358 --> 36:40.991
I'm the police commissioner.
I know everything.

36:40.993 --> 36:42.242
Look...

36:42.244 --> 36:45.829
Frank, I have faced some pretty
scary things in my time.

36:45.831 --> 36:47.948
But the thought of my wife

36:47.950 --> 36:50.334
and my daughter...

36:50.336 --> 36:54.454
watching me
just lose it all... I...

36:54.456 --> 36:56.340
No. I...

36:56.342 --> 36:58.876
I had to push 'em away.

37:00.378 --> 37:02.679
I wouldn't even know
what to say to 'em.

37:02.681 --> 37:06.633
Well, you better think
of something fast.

37:06.635 --> 37:08.852
We got you surrounded.

37:23.601 --> 37:27.103
What are they doing here?

37:27.105 --> 37:30.541
They're hoping to talk
to the man they used to know.

38:07.495 --> 38:09.630
(phone ringing)

38:10.448 --> 38:12.315
Danny.

38:12.317 --> 38:14.668
DANNY: <i>Sis, look, we couldn't move</i>
<i>on Trevor Holt</i>

38:14.670 --> 38:16.119
until we got all
our ducks in a row,

38:16.121 --> 38:18.255
which meant connecting him
to the first victim.

38:18.257 --> 38:19.423
And you did.

38:19.425 --> 38:20.924
Yeah, we did.

38:20.926 --> 38:22.325
Before he worked in New York,

38:22.327 --> 38:24.211
he was a prosecutor
in Stamford, Connecticut.

38:24.213 --> 38:26.129
He prosecuted the case
of a 14-year-old rapist

38:26.131 --> 38:27.664
who only did three months.

38:28.783 --> 38:31.018
It was Martin Cahill,
the first victim.

38:31.020 --> 38:33.720
Whose records were sealed
when he turned 17,

38:33.722 --> 38:36.256
which is why
it never popped for you.

38:36.258 --> 38:38.976
Look, I'm sorry, Sis, but
we're on our way to pick him up.

38:38.978 --> 38:40.110
Well, he's not at the office.

38:40.112 --> 38:42.846
He lost another witness
in that food truck case.

38:42.848 --> 38:45.282
He said he was gonna take
the rest of the day off.

38:45.284 --> 38:47.684
And then, he... left.

38:47.686 --> 38:49.536
Sis, the-the food truck--
where...?

38:49.538 --> 38:51.038
It's-it's in Monroe Park, right?

38:51.040 --> 38:54.074
Danny, he's not right
in the head.

38:54.076 --> 38:57.744
Please be careful,
for you and for him.

38:57.746 --> 39:00.464
I'll do my best, all right?
I'll be in touch.

39:00.466 --> 39:01.465
We gotta go.

39:01.467 --> 39:03.467
(siren wailing)

39:06.754 --> 39:08.755
Moving out?

39:08.757 --> 39:11.892
This ain't my home anymore.

39:13.761 --> 39:15.679
I know
you're pissed at the world.

39:15.681 --> 39:18.882
The world? Try you.

39:18.884 --> 39:20.851
And Ted.

39:20.853 --> 39:23.103
And that lying bitch inside.

39:23.105 --> 39:24.354
What about Kyle?

39:24.356 --> 39:26.323
This ain't his fault.

39:26.325 --> 39:28.075
Then why are you punishing him?

39:31.496 --> 39:33.613
'Cause if you get in this car,
and you drive away,

39:33.615 --> 39:34.364
that's what you're doing.

39:34.366 --> 39:36.116
Forget about your family.

39:38.252 --> 39:40.003
My family was a lie.

39:40.005 --> 39:43.340
Not in that boy's mind.

39:43.342 --> 39:45.909
You're the only father
that he's ever known.

39:48.012 --> 39:50.047
So, sure, he can
get to know Ted.

39:50.049 --> 39:52.632
Maybe he should.

39:52.634 --> 39:55.552
But you're his dad.

39:55.554 --> 39:58.855
You always will be.

39:58.857 --> 40:03.894
Family's all any of us have.

40:05.063 --> 40:07.781
Maybe you can find a way
to keep his together.

40:26.634 --> 40:28.952
(siren wailing)

40:30.388 --> 40:32.189
What is this guy doing?

40:32.191 --> 40:33.140
Come on!

40:33.142 --> 40:35.726
(horn honking)
Hey!

40:35.728 --> 40:37.260
(honking)

40:37.262 --> 40:38.812
Move it!
(honking horn)

40:38.814 --> 40:40.296
Move the truck!

40:40.298 --> 40:41.615
BAEZ:
The drug dealer's

40:41.617 --> 40:43.016
food truck is
across the way.

40:43.018 --> 40:44.467
(honking)

40:44.469 --> 40:45.852
Move!

40:45.854 --> 40:47.320
There's Holt!

40:50.274 --> 40:52.793
I'm going.

40:54.529 --> 40:55.562
Move it!

40:55.564 --> 40:57.313
Hey, move! Police!

40:57.315 --> 40:59.149
Get out of the way!

40:59.151 --> 41:01.535
Move it! Get out of the way!

41:04.422 --> 41:05.889
Get out of the way!

41:05.891 --> 41:07.391
Move!

41:08.242 --> 41:10.110
Trevor Holt! Stop!

41:10.112 --> 41:13.096
Get out of the way!
Move, move, move, move, move!

41:13.681 --> 41:14.748
(people screaming)

41:14.750 --> 41:15.832
(grunting)

41:15.834 --> 41:18.501
Come on! Move!

41:19.637 --> 41:21.772
Get behind the tree!

41:23.624 --> 41:24.775
Drop it!

41:24.777 --> 41:27.310
MAN: Please, don't! Please!
Drop the gun.

41:27.312 --> 41:31.815
No! No! No!
Holt, I said, drop the gun now!

41:31.817 --> 41:33.516
You have to know why
I'm doing this.

41:33.518 --> 41:34.901
I know why you're doing it.

41:34.903 --> 41:36.686
Doesn't mean I'm gonna let you.
Now drop the gun!

41:36.688 --> 41:38.822
But they all deserve it.
Yeah.

41:38.824 --> 41:42.793
They all deserve to die,
but not like this.

41:42.795 --> 41:44.044
No...!

41:44.046 --> 41:45.245
Aah! Please!

41:45.247 --> 41:46.362
Hey!

41:46.364 --> 41:47.530
You don't drop that gun,

41:47.532 --> 41:49.833
you will die
right here, right now.

41:49.835 --> 41:51.718
You don't
want your wife

41:51.720 --> 41:53.086
to remember you like this.

41:53.088 --> 41:56.256
You don't want my sister
to remember you like this, okay?

41:56.258 --> 41:58.225
You're a good man.

41:59.510 --> 42:02.012
(sighing)
Do me a favor, put it down.

42:02.014 --> 42:03.880
Okay.

42:03.882 --> 42:05.098
(panting)

42:05.100 --> 42:06.850
That's it.

42:06.852 --> 42:08.485
Tell everyone I'm sorry.

42:08.487 --> 42:09.769
(gunshot)
Hey...!

42:11.572 --> 42:12.989
(sighs)

42:18.229 --> 42:19.830
It's over.

42:19.832 --> 42:21.364
(panting)

42:24.285 --> 42:27.504
Manhattan detectives,
I need a bus at Monroe Park.

42:27.506 --> 42:32.759
One male shot, but alive,
one male DOA on this location.

42:40.685 --> 42:42.552
