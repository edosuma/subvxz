WEBVTT

00:00.367 --> 00:02.467
Quit nagging me
about my driving.

00:02.468 --> 00:05.436
I do not nag.
You drive like a maniac.

00:05.437 --> 00:07.438
You do too nag.

00:07.439 --> 00:09.741
And it's not "maniac,"
it's pronounced "man-iac."

00:09.742 --> 00:12.877
You were going
35 miles an hour.

00:12.878 --> 00:16.414
Whoa! Since when
is 35 going fast?

00:16.415 --> 00:19.417
Over speed bumps.

00:19.418 --> 00:22.787
Let me ask you a question.
Did your head hit the roof?

00:22.788 --> 00:23.888
No.

00:23.889 --> 00:26.190
Then I could've
gone faster.

00:26.191 --> 00:28.459
Mark, would you please
go and get all that stuff

00:28.460 --> 00:31.429
That flew all over
the back of the station wagon?

00:31.430 --> 00:33.098
Ok, mom.

00:33.099 --> 00:35.133
Yeah. Well, that's
the last time you drive.

00:35.134 --> 00:38.503
I swear, when
we went over that bump,
I heard something crack.

00:38.504 --> 00:40.772
That was just the sound
of the car enjoying itself.

00:40.773 --> 00:42.841
No, that was
the sound of you

00:42.842 --> 00:45.644
Enjoying racing that guy
to the parking-lot exit.

00:45.645 --> 00:48.146
You always turn driving
into a competition.

00:48.147 --> 00:50.815
I do not.
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

00:50.816 --> 00:53.484
Remember the other day,
that 17-year-old pulled up
in that camaro,

00:53.485 --> 00:56.354
And you got that
stupid look on your face?

00:56.355 --> 00:58.857
Which stupid look?

00:58.858 --> 01:02.426
One of your stupider ones.
You know, that one where you
curl your lip up like this

01:02.427 --> 01:05.630
And you go like that
cocky head-roll thing.

01:05.631 --> 01:07.298
That's my elvis.

01:07.299 --> 01:09.500
You can't beat the king,
man. You can't beat the king.

01:09.501 --> 01:12.303
Well, my little hound dog,
you drive your car
the way you want.

01:12.304 --> 01:14.105
Don't ruin my beautiful
station wagon.

01:14.106 --> 01:15.774
"my station wagon"?

01:15.775 --> 01:18.109
Yes.
That's where
we're different.

01:18.110 --> 01:20.478
I think of everything
around this house as ours.

01:20.479 --> 01:22.714
Well, what about the tools?

01:22.715 --> 01:25.684
They're ours. I just don't
want you touching them.

01:27.987 --> 01:30.655
Dad, there's a big black puddle
under mom's car.

01:30.656 --> 01:32.891
Oh, no.
That doesn't mean
it's a bad thing.

01:32.892 --> 01:34.759
We could have struck oil.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.728
It's a gusher. We're rich!
Let's take a look.

02:45.197 --> 02:47.465
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:50.369 --> 02:52.237
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
hey, mom.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.972
Hi. I'll get it.

02:57.877 --> 03:00.078
Hi, mrs. Taylor.
Hi, jennifer. Come on in.

03:00.079 --> 03:03.982
Brad! Jennifer's here.

03:03.983 --> 03:05.616
This is my goldfish
howard.

03:05.617 --> 03:09.720
Oh, so this is the howard
brad is gonna baby-sit.

03:09.721 --> 03:12.023
Hi, howard. Did you
bring a leash?

03:13.826 --> 03:15.526
Hi, bradley.
This is howard.

03:15.527 --> 03:17.762
Hey, how's it going, howard?

03:17.763 --> 03:20.631
You have to feed him
twice a day and keep him
in a well-lit area.

03:20.632 --> 03:23.968
No problem. That's how
we take care of mark.

03:25.704 --> 03:28.106
I'll only be gone
three days,

03:28.107 --> 03:31.375
But I'll really miss you.

03:31.376 --> 03:33.377
Uh-huh.

03:33.378 --> 03:35.914
Aren't you gonna miss me?

03:40.920 --> 03:42.120
Uh-huh.

03:42.121 --> 03:43.955
Well, don't you want to say it?

03:43.956 --> 03:45.824
Uh-uh.

03:48.127 --> 03:50.929
Bye.

03:50.930 --> 03:54.498
Hi, jennifer. Bye, jennifer.
Bye, mr. Taylor.

03:54.499 --> 03:57.902
Brad, I'm going
back up to our room.
Will you miss me?

03:59.671 --> 04:01.539
No running in the house.

04:01.540 --> 04:04.008
Hey, listen to her.
Stop that.

04:04.009 --> 04:06.277
Come on. Hey! Hey!
Stop it.

04:06.278 --> 04:08.012
Hey, what is all this stuff?

04:08.013 --> 04:10.815
I thought that you
were just gonna go
buy me an oil pan thing.

04:10.816 --> 04:14.452
Why stop there? Mark,
show your mother what we got.

04:14.453 --> 04:16.087
New shock absorbers.

04:16.088 --> 04:17.889
Not ordinary shock absorbers.

04:17.890 --> 04:22.125
Binford's best
nitrogen-filled
shock absorbers.

04:22.127 --> 04:24.295
They use these
in all the off-the-road
competitions.

04:24.296 --> 04:27.298
Tim, I don't intend
to drive my car off the road.

04:27.299 --> 04:28.632
Well, you can now.

04:28.633 --> 04:31.236
Do you want to help me
put these on?
Sure.

04:31.237 --> 04:33.637
All right.
Mark, go change
your clothes first.

04:33.638 --> 04:36.307
I'll meet you under the car
in ten minutes.
Ok, dad.

04:36.308 --> 04:38.843
Do you have any
love letters there for me?

04:38.844 --> 04:42.981
Nope. I got one for me.
From damon's hardware.

04:42.982 --> 04:46.251
"dear valued customer."

04:46.252 --> 04:48.719
That's me -
valued, beloved, loyal.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.123
Catalog, coupon...

04:52.124 --> 04:54.492
Smells like a pork sandwich.
Must be from your mom.

04:56.528 --> 05:00.298
Catalog, bank...
Thank you.

05:00.299 --> 05:03.301
Bank... Bank?
If that's from the bank,
why is my name not on there?

05:03.302 --> 05:05.370
It's not for you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:05.371 --> 05:10.408
Hey! Hey!
It is a federal offense
to open somebody else's mail.

05:10.409 --> 05:11.976
I wasn't gonna open it.

05:14.079 --> 05:17.448
"jill taylor, this is your new
checking-account sta-state..."

05:17.449 --> 05:20.018
...Ment.
You opened
your own checking account?

05:20.019 --> 05:22.120
Yes, I did. Do you
have a problem with that?

05:22.121 --> 05:25.056
No, I don't have
a problem with that.

05:25.057 --> 05:28.159
My wife's sneaking
behind my back,
stockpiling money.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.860
Why did you open
your own checking account?

05:29.861 --> 05:32.863
Well,
you know, I'm working now
and I have a little money

05:32.864 --> 05:36.667
And just thought this would
be sort of, like, mine.

05:36.668 --> 05:39.870
Great. I've been working
for 15 years,

05:39.871 --> 05:43.107
So that means the money
in our joint checking account
can be sort of, like,

05:43.108 --> 05:44.442
Mine!

05:44.443 --> 05:48.246
No, no, no.
That will still be ours.

05:48.247 --> 05:50.081
How silly of me!

05:50.082 --> 05:53.284
The money I make, we both spend.
The money you make, you spend.

05:53.285 --> 05:54.953
Now you got it.

05:54.954 --> 05:57.288
<i>(growls)</i> I don't
like that one bit.

05:57.289 --> 05:59.324
But I can spend it on you.

05:59.325 --> 06:00.591
<i>(makes monkey noise)</i>

06:00.592 --> 06:02.961
Yeah. See?

06:02.962 --> 06:06.530
See, back in the old days,
when I wanted to buy you
a birthday present

06:06.531 --> 06:10.068
And I had to write a check
for it, I always felt that
I was spending your money.

06:10.069 --> 06:11.102
Yeah.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.471
But now, I'm spending
my own money.

06:13.472 --> 06:16.040
So this isn't really like just
a checking account, per se.

06:16.041 --> 06:18.876
It's more like
a tim taylor
birthday account.

06:18.877 --> 06:20.945
That's a good way
for you to look at it.

06:23.782 --> 06:26.250
What are you doing?

06:26.251 --> 06:29.153
Remember when jennifer told me
to keep the bowl well-lit?

06:29.154 --> 06:32.857
I think I moved the bowl
a little too close
to the desk lamp.

06:36.895 --> 06:38.096
Well, that was smart.

06:38.097 --> 06:40.764
What'd you think,
he wanted to read in bed?

06:42.501 --> 06:45.036
I didn't know the water
would get that hot.

06:45.037 --> 06:48.006
Just take him out
and see if he flops around.

06:48.007 --> 06:51.342
No way. The only
slimy thing I touch is you.

07:03.422 --> 07:06.657
One, two, three. He's fried.

07:11.897 --> 07:15.366
Oh, man.
What am I gonna do?

07:18.370 --> 07:20.271
Hey, I know.

07:20.272 --> 07:23.107
You can buy her a fish
that looks exactly like him.

07:23.108 --> 07:25.376
Yeah, great idea.

07:25.377 --> 07:27.912
Let's go to the pet store.

07:27.913 --> 07:30.548
What are you
bringing that for?

07:30.549 --> 07:33.284
Well, we need
to bring him along
to compare.

07:33.285 --> 07:36.421
Well, it's not like
he needs the bowl.

07:52.904 --> 07:55.073
<i>(mark)</i> dad, when's
the hot rod coming back?

07:55.074 --> 07:57.241
Uh, as soon as we get it back
from dave's shop.

07:57.242 --> 08:00.678
He's aligning the front end
and trying to fix
the rumble seat for me.

08:00.679 --> 08:02.680
Did you put oil
on the gasket there?

08:02.681 --> 08:03.948
Yep.

08:03.949 --> 08:07.385
All right. My son's
going to be a mechanic.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.653
No. I'm gonna be
a racecar driver.

08:09.654 --> 08:14.125
Oh, ho-ho-ho!
My chest is swelling.

08:15.694 --> 08:18.896
All right, under the car.
Man territory.

08:18.897 --> 08:22.633
The beauty's up top.
This is where the power is, son.

08:22.634 --> 08:25.303
Mom wasn't happy that
you did this to her car.

08:25.304 --> 08:27.305
Well, actually, it's our car.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.540
But mom drives it.

08:29.541 --> 08:32.342
Yeah, but I paid for it,
I restored it, so...

08:32.344 --> 08:35.044
So it's really yours?
Well, technically, yeah.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.715
Is that right?

08:37.716 --> 08:40.251
Ow!

08:40.251 --> 08:42.720
Ow. Ow.

08:42.721 --> 08:46.324
So, technically,
this is your car?

08:46.325 --> 08:49.660
Technically, I got
a mild concussion.

08:49.661 --> 08:52.196
Mark, I need to
talk to your father...

08:52.197 --> 08:54.398
I know. I'm gonna go
wash my hands.

08:54.399 --> 08:56.767
Ok, but leave this.
Oh, man.

08:56.768 --> 08:59.069
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:59.070 --> 09:02.306
Honey, I think
you misheard that.

09:02.307 --> 09:07.278
Maybe I did. I thought that
I just heard my husband say

09:07.279 --> 09:11.282
That this is his car
because he paid for it.

09:11.283 --> 09:14.352
Well, I know him. I don't think
he would've said that.

09:16.087 --> 09:18.856
I know him better than you do,
and I think he did.

09:18.857 --> 09:24.395
Look... I think of it as mine
not because I paid for it,
but because I maintain it.

09:24.396 --> 09:26.830
Well, I maintain the house,

09:26.831 --> 09:29.733
So I guess that would
make it mine.

09:29.734 --> 09:32.170
Well, it can't be yours.
You didn't pay for it.

09:35.174 --> 09:40.911
So, technically,
the house is yours
because you paid for it?

09:40.912 --> 09:45.516
Technically. But I don't
charge you any rent.
I'm kidding!

09:49.521 --> 09:52.323
You've just been lying
all these years

09:52.324 --> 09:55.159
When you said that
everything was ours.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.361
What you really meant was
everything was yours, yours,
yours. Jill has nothing.

09:57.362 --> 10:00.398
You have my heart, honey.

10:00.399 --> 10:03.834
In your very angry hand.
Come on, come on.

10:03.835 --> 10:06.470
Jill, don't get
all whipped up about this.

10:06.471 --> 10:09.740
You know, tim, I have
always thought of this house
as our home.

10:09.741 --> 10:12.142
It is our home.
No, it's not.
It's tim's house.

10:12.143 --> 10:14.478
This is tim's table.
This is tim's couch.
No, it's not. Jill.

10:14.479 --> 10:17.515
All that stuff over there
is tim's.
Jill. Jill!

10:17.516 --> 10:20.084
Oh, look!
Here's something of mine.
These coasters are mine.

10:20.085 --> 10:23.120
Well, actually,
didn't aunt helen send them
to both of us for our wedding?

10:24.556 --> 10:26.156
<i>(mouths)</i>

10:26.157 --> 10:27.925
Well, here's your half.

10:30.295 --> 10:33.264
Good thing she didn't
send us bowling balls.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.833
You are such a hypocrite.

10:35.834 --> 10:38.669
Me? I'm not the one
sneaking around, opening
my own checking account.

10:38.670 --> 10:41.472
Since when is it
sneaking around for me
to go out in broad daylight

10:41.473 --> 10:43.507
And open an account
with my money?

10:43.508 --> 10:45.142
"my money. My money. My..."

10:45.143 --> 10:47.511
Yes. And I need it,
because without it,

10:47.512 --> 10:50.581
All I've got are three kids
and a couple of coasters.

10:50.582 --> 10:53.384
You act like it's my fault
I make all the money and pay for
everything around here.

10:53.385 --> 10:55.219
Why don't you just take
everything around here?

10:55.220 --> 10:57.087
Why don't you take
my checking account, too?

10:57.088 --> 10:59.123
Why do I want that?
There's no money in it.

11:04.829 --> 11:06.297
Oh!

11:11.336 --> 11:13.904
I can't believe it.
Four different pet stores,

11:13.905 --> 11:16.674
And we couldn't find one
that matched howard's spot.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.342
How was I
supposed to know

11:18.343 --> 11:20.811
That there were
20 different types
of goldfish?

11:20.812 --> 11:22.813
Jennifer's
gonna be really mad

11:22.814 --> 11:25.516
When she sees howard
floating there, dead.

11:25.517 --> 11:30.354
Wait. What if
he's not floating?
What?

11:30.355 --> 11:33.758
What if we took
a very tiny ball bearing
and stuck it in his mouth?

11:33.759 --> 11:38.362
He'll sink to the bottom.
She'll think he's alive.

11:38.363 --> 11:40.864
Yeah. Then she'll take him home
and think she killed him.

11:40.865 --> 11:41.932
Right.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.701
Cool.

11:55.414 --> 11:57.415
You over there, wilson?

11:57.416 --> 12:01.452
Down here, good neighbor.
<i>(exhales)</i>

12:06.391 --> 12:08.392
Are you making a snow angel?

12:08.393 --> 12:10.093
Well, I guess I am, neighbor.

12:10.094 --> 12:12.196
But, actually,

12:12.197 --> 12:16.266
I'm preparing for my
annual snowshoe expedition
through the upper peninsula,

12:16.267 --> 12:21.138
And I'm just making sure
that my long johns
stay toasty and dry.

12:21.139 --> 12:26.210
Whoa! Tim,
I think I've found a spot
that is not quite waterproof.

12:26.211 --> 12:28.512
Can I ask you a question?

12:28.513 --> 12:30.280
Hop on my sled, neighbor.

12:30.281 --> 12:32.483
Jill and I got in
this bad argument.

12:32.484 --> 12:34.918
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

12:34.919 --> 12:38.756
She says that I think I own
everything in the house.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.558
Hmm. Well, do you
think that, tim?

12:40.559 --> 12:42.493
No, we own everything together.
50-50.

12:42.494 --> 12:43.828
Tim.

12:43.829 --> 12:46.096
I-I guess I...

12:46.097 --> 12:49.132
To be honest,
I do kind of feel like
I own everything.

12:49.133 --> 12:52.202
Well, tim, you wouldn't
have that problem
if you were a modoc.

12:52.203 --> 12:55.072
A who-doc?

12:55.073 --> 12:57.575
Tim, I'm talking about
the modoc indian tribe.

12:57.576 --> 13:01.479
In their native tongue,
they have no word
for "yours" or "mine,"

13:01.480 --> 13:03.247
Only one word...

13:03.248 --> 13:04.948
For "ours."

13:04.949 --> 13:08.652
Each man's material possession
belongs to the whole tribe.

13:08.653 --> 13:12.890
Ooh, must be difficult
when it comes to underwear.

13:12.891 --> 13:15.593
You see, tim,
in the 20th century,

13:15.594 --> 13:18.996
Our culture tends to
measure a man's worth
by his possessions.

13:18.997 --> 13:21.832
And I got some
cool stuff, too.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.567
That gives you
a feeling of power,
doesn't it?

13:23.568 --> 13:25.836
Oh, you bet...
And control over your life.

13:25.837 --> 13:27.938
Oh, control, ha-ha.

13:27.939 --> 13:29.573
And control over your mate.

13:29.574 --> 13:31.909
Yeah, but...

13:31.910 --> 13:33.043
Oh, yeah. I...

13:35.179 --> 13:39.116
You're saying that
I want to own everything
so I can control jill?

13:39.117 --> 13:41.318
Well, tim, if you
own everything,

13:41.319 --> 13:43.387
You have all the power.

13:46.190 --> 13:50.728
Whoa, tim! I feel an icy blast
moving up my hindquarters.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.930
Best go in
and do a little bit
of waterproofing.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.769
And now for the point
I've really been waiting for -
the heavy-duty sanding.

13:58.770 --> 14:00.471
And for heavy-duty sanding,

14:00.472 --> 14:02.406
We're gonna need
a very special tool. Lisa?

14:05.477 --> 14:07.144
Here you go, tim.

14:07.145 --> 14:09.580
What do you
got there?

14:09.581 --> 14:12.683
Oh, it's a 2100 model
electric drum sander.

14:12.684 --> 14:15.218
That's right.
Four-and-a-half horsepower
patented stabilizer.

14:15.219 --> 14:18.021
Not to mention full swiveling
trailing-wire support.

14:21.292 --> 14:24.161
Almost more than
a man can take. Oh-oh.

14:24.162 --> 14:26.129
Thank you.
You're welcome.

14:26.130 --> 14:27.965
You might also
wanna mention, tim,

14:27.966 --> 14:30.334
That this particular sander
weighs over 240 pounds.

14:30.335 --> 14:31.936
Could you help me
with the...?

14:34.339 --> 14:39.777
Put an apron on there,
we'll call it "al's mom."

14:39.778 --> 14:41.812
Now, because of the weight

14:41.813 --> 14:44.414
And the nature
of the wood surface,
in our case, pine,

14:44.415 --> 14:48.586
I would suggest
going with the 2400 rpms
as opposed to the 28.

14:48.587 --> 14:50.521
Thanks for sharing that, al.

14:50.522 --> 14:53.190
But I think
I'm gonna go with 4200 rpm.

14:53.191 --> 14:55.926
Well, tim, it doesn't
go up to 4200.

14:55.927 --> 14:59.730
Does now,
my stout little friend.

14:59.731 --> 15:00.698
I rewired it.

15:03.134 --> 15:06.537
Now, when going
with a plank floor like this,
you want to go with the grain.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.472
<i>(switches on sander)</i>

15:25.256 --> 15:27.357
On first glance,

15:27.358 --> 15:29.727
This might seem like
I screwed up.

15:32.397 --> 15:35.332
But I've actually done this
to prove an important point.

15:35.333 --> 15:38.569
That you know
absolutely nothing
about sanders?

15:40.038 --> 15:42.272
No.

15:42.273 --> 15:45.275
That too much power
is not always a good thing.

15:45.276 --> 15:49.146
And I know what you're asking.
What kind of power
is he talking about?

15:49.147 --> 15:50.814
I know I am.

15:50.815 --> 15:53.684
Well, I'm not talking about
the kind of power you plug in.

15:53.685 --> 15:55.853
I'm talking about
the power of ownership.

15:55.854 --> 15:59.623
Too often in our lives,
we give too much value
to our possessions,

15:59.624 --> 16:00.991
Like the sander here.

16:00.992 --> 16:03.160
Actually, tim,
this sander was a rental.

16:03.161 --> 16:05.228
Whatever, al.

16:05.229 --> 16:07.865
We can kiss that
security deposit goodbye.

16:09.668 --> 16:13.604
I'm glad I put it
on your credit card.

16:13.605 --> 16:14.605
My credit card?

16:14.606 --> 16:16.774
Let it go, al.

16:16.775 --> 16:19.342
In relationships,
you've gotta be equal.

16:19.343 --> 16:21.445
Share things equally,
no matter who makes the money.

16:21.446 --> 16:24.514
'cause al and I
have a good relationship.
We share.

16:24.515 --> 16:27.350
But I'm no more valuable
than al.
I agree.

16:28.653 --> 16:31.722
Even though I make
a lot more money,

16:31.723 --> 16:34.825
And I get
full medical coverage.

16:34.826 --> 16:36.493
You get full medical?

16:36.494 --> 16:40.230
Sure. But al and I
have learned how to share.

16:40.231 --> 16:43.133
On the job site,
there's no difference between
al's tools and my tools.

16:43.134 --> 16:46.637
Actually, tim, there is.
At the end of the job...

16:46.638 --> 16:47.805
<i>(clicking)</i>

16:47.806 --> 16:49.740

17:07.692 --> 17:09.226
She's not here yet.

17:09.227 --> 17:12.529
Oh, well, I'll bet she's
gonna be happy to see howard.

17:12.530 --> 17:15.565
Howard, did you miss
jennif... Brad.

17:17.602 --> 17:19.603
This fish is not alive.

17:19.604 --> 17:21.839
Yeah, it is.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.608
It's standing up straight.
Fish don't do that.

17:24.608 --> 17:28.946
I trained him. Good fish.
Keep standing.

17:28.947 --> 17:32.016
Brad,
did you kill howard?

17:32.017 --> 17:33.951
Yes.

17:33.952 --> 17:37.855
If he's dead, why isn't he
floating on the top?

17:42.560 --> 17:44.628
I stuck a ball bearing
in his mouth.

17:44.629 --> 17:46.563
Oh, brad!

17:46.564 --> 17:47.831
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

17:47.832 --> 17:50.367
Mom, that's jennifer.
What am I gonna do?

17:50.368 --> 17:52.402
Well, you're gonna have to
tell her the truth.

17:52.403 --> 17:54.471
Spare her
the ball-bearing thing.

17:54.472 --> 17:55.939
Oh, man.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.507
Hi, jennifer. Come on in.

17:57.508 --> 17:59.543
Hi, jennifer. Did you
have a nice trip?

17:59.544 --> 18:02.412
Very nice, mrs. Taylor.
That's good.

18:02.413 --> 18:04.715
Hi, bradley. Thanks
for taking care of howard.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.449
Oh, he was no trouble.

18:06.450 --> 18:08.385
He slept most of the time.

18:11.956 --> 18:13.691
I'll see you at school Monday.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.227
Brad?

18:17.228 --> 18:19.563
<i>(mouths)</i>

18:19.564 --> 18:21.165
Listen...

18:21.166 --> 18:23.200
Jennifer...

18:23.201 --> 18:27.404
Brad, is there
something wrong
with howard?

18:27.405 --> 18:31.141
He's kind of...

18:31.142 --> 18:32.209
Dead.

18:32.210 --> 18:34.111
What happened?

18:34.112 --> 18:39.249
Well, let's just say
he saw a bright light
and went towards it.

18:45.056 --> 18:45.989
Jennifer?

18:47.892 --> 18:49.426
Jennifer?

18:50.595 --> 18:53.597
Look, jennifer,
it was an accident.

18:53.598 --> 18:58.301
But all brad worried about
was how you'd feel.

18:58.302 --> 19:01.404
Is that true, bradley?

19:01.405 --> 19:04.775
He said he'd feel awful
if he made you cry.

19:05.977 --> 19:07.044
Really, bradley?

19:11.315 --> 19:15.252
That's so sweet. I'm really glad
you talked to me about this.

19:20.058 --> 19:23.560
Hey, jennifer,
maybe we can find another fish
just like howard.

19:23.561 --> 19:24.995
Good luck.

19:29.067 --> 19:32.435
Well, um... Mom,
I'm gonna walk jennifer home.

19:32.436 --> 19:36.373
Oh, ok.
Bye-bye, jennifer.
Bye, mrs. Taylor.

19:36.374 --> 19:39.109
Randy, that was so cool,
the way you stood up
for your brother.

19:39.110 --> 19:40.477
Well, mom,

19:40.478 --> 19:43.346
I kind of broke his game boy,
so now he won't beat me up.

19:46.584 --> 19:49.219
Hey, pistonhead.

19:49.220 --> 19:51.021
Hey, crankshaft.

19:53.357 --> 19:54.391
Hi.

19:54.392 --> 19:55.993
Hi.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.094
How was your day?

19:57.095 --> 19:58.395
Delightful.

19:58.396 --> 20:00.130
Is that 'cause
I wasn't here?

20:00.131 --> 20:01.298
Maybe.

20:01.299 --> 20:04.134
I was talking to wilson,

20:04.135 --> 20:06.670
And I think I know
what the trouble is.

20:06.671 --> 20:08.371
We got into an argument

20:08.372 --> 20:12.042
Because we tried to
define our relationship
by our possessions.

20:12.043 --> 20:14.311
I agree.

20:14.312 --> 20:15.712
I think we could
learn a lot

20:15.713 --> 20:18.248
From this tribe
called the mopeds.

20:20.919 --> 20:23.086
The mopeds?

20:23.087 --> 20:26.723
Yeah. It's a tribe
that share everything,
even their underwear.

20:26.724 --> 20:28.792
Tim, what are you
talking about?

20:28.793 --> 20:31.995
Truth is, I...
I do judge myself
on my possessions

20:31.996 --> 20:34.631
And what I bring
into this house.

20:34.632 --> 20:37.567
But you do so much, how do I
put a price tag on that?

20:37.568 --> 20:39.169
Try.

20:39.170 --> 20:42.472
Aha. I knew
you were gonna say that.

20:42.473 --> 20:44.641
So I figured this out
at work today and wrote down
what you should've earned,

20:44.642 --> 20:46.643
Could I have
afforded to pay you,

20:46.644 --> 20:49.213
For all the 12 1/2 years of work
you've done around the house.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.481
And, even though I wasn't
legally bound to do this,

20:51.482 --> 20:56.920
I threw in a bonus
for the pain of childbirth.

20:56.921 --> 20:59.756
That'd better
be a big bonus.

20:59.757 --> 21:01.424
Honey, I was there.
I know what you went through.

21:01.425 --> 21:02.525
Oh, you do, do you?

21:02.526 --> 21:04.361
Yes. It was painful
for me, too.

21:04.362 --> 21:06.163
All that screaming
hurt my ears.

21:06.164 --> 21:07.898
Yeah, right.

21:09.067 --> 21:11.434
How much do I get?
Listen to this.

21:11.435 --> 21:13.737
580 million dollars
and 60 cents.

21:13.738 --> 21:14.771
I rounded it off.

21:14.772 --> 21:16.940
Hand it over.

21:16.941 --> 21:19.176
I'm a little short.

21:19.177 --> 21:21.278
I was kinda hoping
I could work some of it off.

21:21.279 --> 21:23.347
How are you
gonna do that?

21:23.348 --> 21:25.615
By satisfying
every one of your needs.

21:28.219 --> 21:30.553
That'll use up
about 20 bucks.

21:33.424 --> 21:36.326
Since you are
being so generous,

21:36.327 --> 21:38.528
Perhaps I should have
my checks reprinted.

21:38.529 --> 21:41.265
No. I was stupid.
Have your own checking account.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.867
No, no. I want to, I want to.

21:43.868 --> 21:48.105
It'll be a joint account,
equal, 50-50.

21:48.106 --> 21:50.740
Equal? You don't
have to do this.
Here. How would that look?

21:50.741 --> 21:54.011
You could've left 'em the way...
"mr. And mrs. Jill taylor."

21:54.012 --> 21:55.078
Oh-oh-oh-oh!

22:00.451 --> 22:02.119

I realized today

22:02.120 --> 22:04.454
We need to order
new checks for the old account.

22:04.455 --> 22:07.857
I was thinking maybe we should
change the design.

22:07.858 --> 22:09.893
What's the matter
with the old one?

22:09.894 --> 22:12.629
I don't know.
It's just not us.

22:12.630 --> 22:18.368

it'd be nice to have, like,
a sunset or some daisies or...

22:18.369 --> 22:21.038
Some frolicking bunnies.

22:23.474 --> 22:26.243
I hope you're kidding.
Do you expect me to go
to the hardware store

22:26.244 --> 22:28.445
And order a nail gun
with bunny checks?

a little more manly.

I'm sure I'm gonna
go to the grocery store
