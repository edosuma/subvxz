02:36.535 --> 02:37.815
What's going on, bro?

02:37.816 --> 02:39.316
Yeah, good to see you buddy.

02:39.317 --> 02:41.117
Good to see you, too.
How you doing?

02:41.318 --> 02:44.378
Hey dude, let this foxy as oz.

02:45.169 --> 02:46.209
In there!

02:46.640 --> 02:47.710
Thank you.

02:48.426 --> 02:49.636
- Hey!
- Hey!

02:49.836 --> 02:50.829
How are you doing?

02:50.830 --> 02:51.830
- Good!
- Yeah?

02:51.877 --> 02:53.635
Yeah, I didn't think you
were coming back.

02:53.837 --> 02:56.323
I told you I'd come back,
would you miss me?

02:56.329 --> 02:58.221
- Maybe
- You look great!

02:58.409 --> 02:59.470
Thanks!

02:59.522 --> 03:02.467
So loud in here, you wanna
go talk somewhere else?

03:02.469 --> 03:04.617
- Some where quieter?
- Okay

03:04.619 --> 03:05.650
Yeah?
Let's go!

03:19.595 --> 03:20.905
Don't let anyone in.

03:26.886 --> 03:27.886
Come here.

03:39.545 --> 03:42.125
Have a sip...
Come on, yeah!

03:43.669 --> 03:45.486
Here we go!

03:54.507 --> 03:55.507
Come here!

03:58.663 --> 04:03.156
You know what'd make
this night... really perfect?

04:11.086 --> 04:13.850
No, I don't think we
should be doing this.

04:13.973 --> 04:14.973
Yes!

04:15.993 --> 04:19.458
Come on, It's not
a big deal... It really isn't.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.646
Come on!

04:47.210 --> 04:48.467
Oh shit, yo!

04:48.468 --> 04:50.728
It's my boyfriend's dick, yeah!

04:51.255 --> 04:52.692
Oh my God!

04:57.750 --> 04:59.326
I don't remember the
Little Red Riding Hood...

04:59.327 --> 05:01.247
ever doing this act,
in the fairytale.

05:01.248 --> 05:03.340
I can't believe she would
do something like that.

05:03.341 --> 05:04.831
It just doesn't seem like her.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.622
Oh, grandma what a
big dick you have!

05:14.011 --> 05:16.001
You're gonna be a star, kid!

05:28.274 --> 05:29.274
Markus!

05:31.255 --> 05:32.255
Markus!

05:32.616 --> 05:33.616
Oh, shit!

05:35.210 --> 05:36.572
What's this I'm hearing
about pictures...

05:36.573 --> 05:38.723
that have been taken
from you and Kylie?

05:37.955 --> 05:39.310
Oh yeah, it's horrible.

05:39.525 --> 05:40.851
Well, what do you mean
"It's horrible"?

05:40.852 --> 05:42.711
I heard you had a hand in.

05:42.712 --> 05:43.712
Oh shit!

05:44.035 --> 05:45.644
Hey, I love your technique.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.045
Hey Kylie, Can I
take you to prom?

06:01.753 --> 06:03.450
There you are, bitch!

06:03.948 --> 06:05.645
What? Don't got
anything to say?

06:05.785 --> 06:08.297
Won't open your mouth for me,
but you go for my boyfriend?

06:09.301 --> 06:11.021
Markus said you guys broke up.

06:12.344 --> 06:13.694
Shut your fucking mouth!

06:13.700 --> 06:16.116
Relax Kylie, we only
have a question for you.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.675
- Do you spit or swallow?
- Open up!

06:23.873 --> 06:26.343
Guess this answers that question.

06:26.344 --> 06:29.115
You want the boys
be disappointed.

06:29.503 --> 06:32.824
You tell anyone about this...
and I'll destroy you!

06:32.829 --> 06:33.829
Got it?

06:34.119 --> 06:35.119
Got it?

06:36.670 --> 06:38.640
Namaste whore!

07:05.678 --> 07:06.720
Kylie!

07:12.445 --> 07:14.250
Holy shit!

07:17.644 --> 07:21.163
Kylie look, I'm kind of in
deep shit with principal Morris.

07:21.418 --> 07:23.613
He thinks I knew about this.

07:23.623 --> 07:25.437
I mean, you know
that's bullshit.

07:26.924 --> 07:29.133
Hey come on, Kylie!

07:29.354 --> 07:31.113
What did I do?

07:31.281 --> 07:32.913
Kylie!
Kylie!

07:33.228 --> 07:34.928
Thought we were
having fun, what...

07:35.949 --> 07:36.949
Hey!

07:36.953 --> 07:38.120
Kylie!

07:38.288 --> 07:40.313
Hey look, are you
gonna talk to Morris?

07:40.316 --> 07:42.356
Just tell me if you're
gonna talk to Morris... Ky..!

07:42.593 --> 07:43.711
Fuck!

07:54.912 --> 07:55.912
Shit!

09:49.017 --> 09:50.978
Mom, what the hell!

09:50.984 --> 09:52.006
You wanna tell me, why...

09:52.007 --> 09:53.917
I'm getting calls from the
principal about you today?

09:53.924 --> 09:55.117
Get out!

09:55.118 --> 09:58.429
I've spent 17 years,
making sure...

09:58.670 --> 10:01.019
that you don't turn into
someone I'm ashamed of.

10:01.027 --> 10:03.195
You don't understand,
I didn't even want to!

10:03.200 --> 10:06.152
You didn't want to,
but you did anyways.

10:10.870 --> 10:14.466
This is a lifelong
problem for you, Kylie.

10:15.507 --> 10:18.528
You need to learn to
stand up for yourself.

10:24.130 --> 10:26.997
The Harrison’s are expecting
you at 7:00, It's a long drive...

10:26.998 --> 10:29.592
I want you out of here by 6:00.

10:40.853 --> 10:43.416
Okay guys, go
right up to the door.

10:43.798 --> 10:45.233
Make sure to say "thank you".

10:45.641 --> 10:48.564
- I hope this's gonna be good.
- Use your manners.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.885
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

10:51.999 --> 10:55.456
- Trick or treat.
- Aren't you a beautiful princess?

10:55.645 --> 10:58.540
- And look at you... and take!
- Thank you.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.101
Well, hello Eric.

11:00.102 --> 11:02.432
- Happy Halloween!
- Thank you.

11:09.035 --> 11:10.404
Kylie, Kylie!

11:10.405 --> 11:11.965
Hi...
Hold on!

11:11.966 --> 11:13.418
Just a sec, okay Lucy!

11:13.419 --> 11:14.639
Hold on!

11:14.640 --> 11:16.410
- Kylie!
- What?

11:16.416 --> 11:17.757
Be nice, OK?

11:17.993 --> 11:21.282
What makes you think they want
me taking care of their kids?

11:21.694 --> 11:24.234
Yeah, just forget it!

11:28.060 --> 11:30.046
Hi guys!

12:02.910 --> 12:03.910
Hello?

12:04.033 --> 12:06.272
Morris's talking about expelling me.

12:06.278 --> 12:07.142
Really?

12:07.148 --> 12:08.997
You gotta tell him,
we were just having fun.

12:09.002 --> 12:12.370
I had no idea of whom
those assholes took the camera.

12:13.263 --> 12:17.264
Shut up, you little shit!
I'm on the phone.

12:17.722 --> 12:18.876
I'm coming over.

12:19.011 --> 12:21.679
No, I'm not at home,
babysitting tonight.

12:21.930 --> 12:25.979
Look, get me off the hook with Morris,
this goes way for both of us.

12:35.362 --> 12:37.068
What the hell?

13:11.841 --> 13:13.684
Holy shit!

13:43.115 --> 13:44.342
Kylie!

13:44.825 --> 13:47.270
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

13:50.588 --> 13:52.793
Hey, thanks for coming
out all this way.

13:52.798 --> 13:57.472
We're going to the uh... school
board annual... parent scare party.

13:57.480 --> 14:01.753
And finding a babysitter around
here has been... really cut throat.

14:01.969 --> 14:05.989
Right, Mrs. Harrison works
for the school board.

14:06.073 --> 14:10.007
Yeah, um... let me take your things.

14:11.092 --> 14:12.692
Let me show you around.

14:12.693 --> 14:14.276
Big House.

14:14.759 --> 14:18.869
The kitchen of course, excuse
the mess... we are moving.

14:19.474 --> 14:22.986
This place is sick!
Why are you guys moving?

14:22.989 --> 14:25.216
Oh, It's uh... hunted!

14:25.222 --> 14:26.970
Seriously?

14:27.244 --> 14:29.438
I'm kidding!

14:29.740 --> 14:31.613
We're moving corporate
headquarters into the city...

14:31.614 --> 14:33.684
and the commute would
have been killer so...

14:33.686 --> 14:35.925
Where are you
supposed to be, anyway?

14:37.138 --> 14:40.206
James Dean, "Rebel Without a Cause."

14:40.931 --> 14:45.871
"You're tearing me apart!"
yeah?

14:45.896 --> 14:48.610
Well, the place is beautiful!

14:49.372 --> 14:52.063
Yeah, wife's money.

14:52.064 --> 14:54.236
I'll introduce you to the kids.

14:58.967 --> 15:00.237
Wow!

15:00.358 --> 15:02.237
Kids are ready for bed.

15:02.238 --> 15:05.188
And hopefully not too
rolled up on sugar.

15:05.194 --> 15:09.263
Phoebe, Sam...
say hello to Kylie.

15:09.266 --> 15:10.829
- Hi!
- Hi!

15:10.830 --> 15:13.903
This is the Reynolds,
he's from London, England.

15:13.905 --> 15:15.330
Hi Reynolds!

15:15.332 --> 15:17.530
- They can stay up until 9:00.
- 10:00?

15:17.537 --> 15:20.692
No 9:00, but only
because it's Halloween...

15:20.693 --> 15:22.359
And only because they promised...

15:22.360 --> 15:25.760
to be extra well-behaved
tonight, right?

15:27.606 --> 15:30.200
OK, I'll show you to the rooms,
okay?

15:31.198 --> 15:34.917
Let's see, rest of the house...
I'll show you upstairs.

15:35.137 --> 15:37.858
Kids' rooms are at
the top of the stairs.

15:40.572 --> 15:42.506
- You like the stone work?
- Yeah.

15:42.507 --> 15:44.904
The stone we put in last summer.

15:44.905 --> 15:46.416
A lot of work.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.457
- Wow!
- Yeah?

15:48.466 --> 15:50.194
You can get lost in this place.

15:50.412 --> 15:53.275
Oh yeah, we still haven't
found the last babysitter.

15:53.276 --> 15:54.876
I'm just kidding!

15:54.987 --> 15:57.432
Right up there, that's
Sam's little fiefdom.

15:57.441 --> 16:01.643
And right below, this
is... Phoebe's room.

16:02.254 --> 16:03.784
So...

16:04.474 --> 16:06.754
Kylie, hi!

16:06.785 --> 16:08.978
How are you?

16:08.995 --> 16:10.615
Good.

16:10.618 --> 16:15.752
Good... you've certainly
grown up, haven't you?

16:17.363 --> 16:21.756
- Ready to roll Mr.deem?
- Yeah, I'll just get your coat.

16:24.802 --> 16:26.851
We'll be back at
1:00 a.m at the latest.

16:26.852 --> 16:28.832
- Okay.
- So...

16:28.836 --> 16:30.455
Have fun.

16:35.021 --> 16:39.409
No parties or boys, understand?

16:40.682 --> 16:44.733
If I could've found anybody else
on such short notice, I would have.

16:44.735 --> 16:46.942
You take care of my kids.

16:47.055 --> 16:50.701
They're your only priority tonight.
You hear me?

17:02.692 --> 17:06.839
Only 6 kids came by, so
we got the leftover candies.

17:06.846 --> 17:08.509
I'm good.

17:10.365 --> 17:12.400
You can have a
piece, if you want.

17:55.943 --> 17:57.887
- Nice mask!
- Thanks.

17:58.154 --> 18:00.106
Do werewolves play hiding or seek?

18:00.323 --> 18:01.323
Probably not.

18:01.490 --> 18:03.459
Of course they do,
they hunt in the dark.

18:03.766 --> 18:06.311
- I wanna play hiding or seek.
- Yeah, come on!

18:06.544 --> 18:07.544
Come play!

18:19.545 --> 18:24.844
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

18:25.318 --> 18:27.967
and this is the last time.

19:00.185 --> 19:03.629
- Hello?
- Is your refrigerator running?

19:03.637 --> 19:05.213
Go to hell!

19:07.892 --> 19:09.553
You said a bad word.

19:12.216 --> 19:14.502
Let's go find your brother.

19:15.453 --> 19:16.723
Okay.

19:23.504 --> 19:25.024
Whoa!

19:27.749 --> 19:30.460
He thinks he's so good,
but I always find him.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.461
Wow!

19:41.495 --> 19:43.735
There's lots of places
for him to hide in here.

19:43.736 --> 19:45.936
And I don't think he's in here.

19:46.028 --> 19:47.257
Sam!

19:50.958 --> 19:52.435
Do you know where
your brother is?

19:52.436 --> 19:54.726
I'm not telling you.

19:55.993 --> 19:57.952
Is he under here?

20:06.169 --> 20:08.045
Not in there.

20:12.444 --> 20:14.807
Sam!
I give up.

20:15.098 --> 20:17.277
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

20:18.749 --> 20:19.969
Not funny, guys.

20:22.950 --> 20:24.204
Time for bed.

20:24.417 --> 20:26.198
- Already?
- Yeah.

20:26.199 --> 20:28.269
- How about a story?
- Yeah!

20:28.270 --> 20:29.797
I don't think so, It's late.

20:30.068 --> 20:33.225
You... bed
You... upstairs.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.432
Okay, let's get you tucked in.

20:45.326 --> 20:47.648
Remember the time,
when you couldn't find me...

20:47.649 --> 20:50.269
when we were
playing hiding or seek?

20:50.272 --> 20:53.054
Yeah, that was awesome.

20:56.871 --> 20:59.649
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:05.123 --> 21:09.392
- Kylie, I'm scared.
- Of what?

21:09.398 --> 21:11.915
Monsters in my closet.

21:11.988 --> 21:14.974
There's no such
things as monsters...

21:14.975 --> 21:18.375
at least not until
high school, anyway.

21:19.714 --> 21:22.863
There is monsters
in high school?

21:24.829 --> 21:26.209
Go to sleep!

21:34.463 --> 21:38.445
There, See?
No monsters.

21:39.433 --> 21:42.590
Can you tell me a story?

21:43.351 --> 21:44.811
Seriously?

21:44.815 --> 21:46.443
Please!

21:49.941 --> 21:51.357
Once upon a time...

21:51.663 --> 21:54.903
there was a little
girl named Phoebe.

21:55.656 --> 21:57.594
She was a princess.

21:58.072 --> 22:01.844
And she lived in a
great big castle.

22:01.847 --> 22:05.549
She had many great friends
who always stood up for her,

22:05.804 --> 22:07.174
And looked out for her.

22:08.811 --> 22:13.975
When she grew up, she become
a great and powerful queen.

22:14.476 --> 22:16.588
And never, ever ever...

22:16.906 --> 22:19.713
not even once in all her days,

22:19.995 --> 22:23.623
did she ever see a monster.
The End.

22:24.131 --> 22:27.283
- I liked that story.
- I thought you might.

22:27.678 --> 22:29.400
- Good night!
- Good night!

22:39.081 --> 22:40.401
Whoa!

23:28.802 --> 23:30.902
Oh, wow!

24:19.461 --> 24:23.033
- Hello!
- Can I speak with your parents?

24:23.266 --> 24:26.750
- They are in bed.
- Can I speak with them?

24:27.778 --> 24:31.786
- They're sleeping.
- Can you wake them up?

24:33.202 --> 24:36.823
- Markus?
- Can you wake them up?

24:37.783 --> 24:39.474
This isn't funny!

26:36.974 --> 26:38.931
Trick or treat.

26:41.042 --> 26:42.920
Trick or treat.

26:54.828 --> 26:57.314
What are you doing out so late?

26:59.278 --> 27:01.352
Do you want some candy?

27:15.577 --> 27:17.347
Do you know what time it is?

27:32.698 --> 27:34.999
Trick or treat.

27:47.558 --> 27:49.916
Fuck!
Come on!

27:58.492 --> 28:00.054
Hello?

28:00.761 --> 28:03.497
911, Emergency.
Do you require police, fire organization...

28:03.505 --> 28:06.342
Police, People outside
in pig mask!

28:06.343 --> 28:08.513
They just tried to grab me!

28:10.292 --> 28:11.353
Hello?

28:17.073 --> 28:18.504
Hello?

28:19.772 --> 28:21.754
911, what is your emergency?

28:21.961 --> 28:24.808
There're people outside
in pig mask, they cut the bolt.

28:24.815 --> 28:28.549
And just tried to grab me.
And now I think they're trying to get in.

28:28.759 --> 28:30.169
Slow down!
Tell me your name.

28:31.446 --> 28:33.151
My name is Kylie Winters.

28:33.344 --> 28:34.681
How many people are after you?

28:34.933 --> 28:37.117
I think there's... three.

28:37.632 --> 28:40.678
Two men and a child.

28:40.714 --> 28:42.361
All right, what's your address?

28:42.836 --> 28:48.054
3, Mindoro road... in Berkshire county.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.640
Please, I'm just the babysitter.

28:50.886 --> 28:54.003
OK Kylie, I'm gonna put you
on hold, but I'll be right back.

28:54.295 --> 28:57.159
I'm going to inform
police of your situation.

29:13.977 --> 29:16.382
Please help me!

29:21.919 --> 29:22.919
Kylie?

29:24.234 --> 29:26.433
It's okay Kylie, I'm back.

29:26.434 --> 29:28.454
And I'm gonna stay
on the line with you.

29:28.461 --> 29:29.998
How many children
are in your cab?

29:30.285 --> 29:33.081
Two.
There's two!

29:34.617 --> 29:36.069
The windows.

29:53.063 --> 29:54.931
- Shit!
- Whom you are begging?

29:55.153 --> 29:56.847
Phoebe, upstairs to
your room, right now!

29:56.848 --> 29:58.418
Why are you so scared?

29:58.423 --> 30:01.591
Go to your room, lock your door
and hide.

30:05.549 --> 30:08.224
Please help us!
We're in the middle of nowhere.

30:17.347 --> 30:18.347
Phoebe!

30:23.457 --> 30:24.457
Phoebe?

30:35.511 --> 30:36.512
Phoebe!

31:02.721 --> 31:05.727
- Hello, are you still there!
- Kylie?

31:06.049 --> 31:08.035
I haven't gone anywhere,
I'm still here.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.968
They are in the house.

31:10.284 --> 31:12.836
Do you have the
children with you?

31:13.544 --> 31:17.978
I think she's gone.
I think they took her.

31:19.369 --> 31:20.591
Where are you right now?

31:21.608 --> 31:24.432
Hiding in the kitchen.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.666
I'm gonna be honest with you, Kylie.

31:27.667 --> 31:30.967
The police are still about
10 minutes away.

31:33.689 --> 31:35.198
I'm gonna die.

31:35.998 --> 31:38.215
I'm gonna help you through this,
if you trust me.

31:38.216 --> 31:40.726
Do you have something
to protect yourself with?

31:42.928 --> 31:43.928
Yes.

33:37.313 --> 33:38.313
Phoebe!

33:40.273 --> 33:41.273
Sam!

33:46.477 --> 33:47.477
Sam!

33:48.910 --> 33:49.910
Sam!

33:50.280 --> 33:51.280
Phoebe?

36:23.179 --> 36:24.179
Hey!

36:53.522 --> 36:56.669
Don't!
Let me off!

37:13.407 --> 37:14.603
Hello?

37:14.669 --> 37:16.919
Kylie, what's going on?

37:17.319 --> 37:19.609
They have Sam, now.

37:19.610 --> 37:22.490
I can't do this!

37:22.496 --> 37:24.277
I'm gonna gone away here.

37:24.282 --> 37:27.015
Kylie, calm down!
Listen to my voice.

37:27.306 --> 37:28.935
The police are almost there.

37:29.177 --> 37:32.824
I never should've
opened that door, just like...

37:32.833 --> 37:35.168
I never should've followed
him in that room!

37:35.176 --> 37:40.376
And never had that stupid video,
now everybody thinks I'm whore.

37:40.454 --> 37:42.823
Kylie, you're not making any sense.

37:42.824 --> 37:45.274
You need to keep
it together, okay?

37:51.656 --> 37:53.947
I'm useless.

37:55.532 --> 37:58.060
OK, can you get
out of the house?

37:59.272 --> 38:00.381
I think so.

38:00.951 --> 38:03.439
Good!
I'll stay on the line with you.

38:21.910 --> 38:26.540
1-21, you're on your way to
number 3 Mindoro road, yes?

38:26.541 --> 38:30.811
Car 1-21, just finishing up
here, then I'll roll to Mindoro.

39:30.198 --> 39:32.641
Kylie, are you there?

39:32.645 --> 39:35.608
I'm still on the line with you.

39:39.034 --> 39:40.383
Kylie, are you there?

39:41.833 --> 39:43.690
I just wanna go.

39:43.942 --> 39:45.975
Kylie, I know it's hard.

39:46.268 --> 39:50.387
But you're safer staying put
and waiting for the police.

39:51.823 --> 39:52.823
Okay.

39:54.998 --> 39:56.504
You're not alone, Kylie

39:56.505 --> 39:59.845
your need are those children,
because they've got you.

40:00.623 --> 40:03.504
I know we don't
know each other, Kylie

40:03.602 --> 40:05.943
but you don't seem like
someone who just gives up.

40:09.462 --> 40:10.837
What's your name?

40:11.355 --> 40:12.355
Roberta.

40:12.650 --> 40:15.086
Can you stay on the
line with me, Roberta?

40:15.399 --> 40:16.824
I'm not going anywhere.

40:17.158 --> 40:18.455
Good!

40:19.989 --> 40:23.047
'Cause I don't think
I could do this alone.

41:57.335 --> 41:59.560
Sam!
Phoebe!

42:07.283 --> 42:09.185
Roberta!
Shit!

42:18.271 --> 42:19.277
Oh, shit!

42:21.348 --> 42:22.555
Oh my God!

42:31.577 --> 42:32.867
Phoebe!

43:48.707 --> 43:49.718
Phoebe!

43:51.064 --> 43:52.064
Sam!

44:00.430 --> 44:02.438
Phoebe! Sam!

44:02.763 --> 44:06.230
Wake up!
Come on, wake up!

44:16.451 --> 44:20.431
1-21, what's your ETA
on 3, Mindoro road?

44:20.432 --> 44:24.032
Car 1-21 here, We're
about 4 minutes out, over

44:24.523 --> 44:27.893
Copy 1-21, still trying
to reestablish contact.

44:35.443 --> 44:36.649
Holy shit!

44:46.180 --> 44:47.350
Oh God!

44:51.123 --> 44:52.762
Hey, wake up!

44:55.191 --> 44:57.817
Please!
Wake up!

45:01.298 --> 45:03.087
Little boy, wake up!

45:03.088 --> 45:04.142
Kylie?

45:05.804 --> 45:06.902
- Phoebe!
- Kylie!

45:06.903 --> 45:07.903
Hush...

45:07.952 --> 45:10.797
I need you to be brave
and stay quiet, okay?

45:10.869 --> 45:12.464
I want my mom.

45:12.465 --> 45:16.445
I know, just stay quiet, and
all of us will get to see our moms.

45:18.423 --> 45:20.153
We need to go!

45:20.902 --> 45:22.933
What's happening?

45:25.028 --> 45:26.772
Where is Jonathan?

45:32.044 --> 45:35.314
- Wait, listen!
- Kylie, what's going on?

45:35.315 --> 45:38.005
Whatever happens, just run!

45:53.809 --> 45:55.944
Go!
Go!

45:58.178 --> 46:00.121
Kylie!

46:07.986 --> 46:09.658
Run, Jonathan!

46:11.726 --> 46:12.799
Go!
Go!

46:28.168 --> 46:29.168
No!

46:29.652 --> 46:31.863
Okay, inside!

46:37.310 --> 46:39.834
Sam, where's he best place to
hide besides the upstairs closet?

46:39.841 --> 46:42.415
- Basement.
- Okay, let's go!

46:49.282 --> 46:50.981
We need to really
get hide in a place.

46:58.940 --> 46:59.940
Okay.

46:59.941 --> 47:01.749
Sam, I need your help.

47:01.985 --> 47:04.142
Can you find me the
best place to hide in here?

47:04.456 --> 47:06.283
- I'm scared.
- I know, me too.

47:06.544 --> 47:08.265
But the police are coming, okay?

47:08.266 --> 47:09.266
- Okay.
- Okay.

47:39.196 --> 47:41.738
God, I hate Halloween.

47:43.722 --> 47:45.724
Twenty bucks as it
just another crazy.

47:45.727 --> 47:48.840
It ain't seem crazy to you
see my kid hopped on sugar.

47:50.092 --> 47:51.250
You got this?

47:52.822 --> 47:54.126
Eat your damn sandwich.

48:28.248 --> 48:29.248
Hello!

48:30.210 --> 48:31.486
Anybody home?

48:41.662 --> 48:42.980
No answer.

48:43.080 --> 48:45.201
I'm gonna set a pick
around back, Over.

48:46.322 --> 48:47.322
Copy.

49:04.638 --> 49:05.885
It is the police?

49:05.886 --> 49:07.186
Hush...

49:25.034 --> 49:26.034
Hello!

49:32.487 --> 49:33.823
Hello!

49:37.656 --> 49:38.656
Hello!

49:41.427 --> 49:42.757
This's the police.

49:44.539 --> 49:46.429
We're responding
to your distress call.

50:07.764 --> 50:09.287
Is anybody home?

50:38.430 --> 50:42.078
Dispatch, this's 1-21, requiring
immediate backup to 3-mindoro.

50:42.336 --> 50:44.538
Multiple potential 5-9 force.

50:45.309 --> 50:47.039
Copy that, 1-21.

50:57.330 --> 51:02.240
Possible abduction reported.
Repeat, possible abduction under way.

51:13.768 --> 51:14.826
Sir?

51:16.210 --> 51:17.706
Sir, are you OK?

51:20.065 --> 51:23.395
Dispatch, this's 1-21,
what's the ETA on our backup?

51:23.399 --> 51:25.216
About 12 minutes out, over

51:25.217 --> 51:27.617
Sir, Put your hands
where I can see.

51:27.625 --> 51:28.813
Sir, you OK?

51:29.921 --> 51:31.977
Riley, where the hell are you?

51:32.727 --> 51:33.758
Sir!

51:35.302 --> 51:37.133
Sir, are you OK?

51:37.134 --> 51:38.344
Answer me!

52:00.617 --> 52:04.238
Come in1-21, what's your status
of number 3 - Mindoro?

52:06.552 --> 52:07.552
1-21?

52:14.267 --> 52:16.488
What's your status, 1-21?

52:29.107 --> 52:31.460
The police aren't coming, are they?

52:33.525 --> 52:37.401
Your post is so good.
We're safe here.

52:39.736 --> 52:43.735
You hear that Phoebe?
You did so good.

52:45.697 --> 52:49.207
Can you be brave for
me just a little bit longer?

53:19.952 --> 53:22.694
Sam, how far way is
to the nearest house?

53:22.799 --> 53:26.342
- A driver across the road.
- How far?

53:26.618 --> 53:30.539
I don't know but could you
just please stay with us?

53:30.542 --> 53:32.896
Sam, I lost my phone.

53:32.917 --> 53:34.957
And we need help.

53:40.625 --> 53:43.432
I'll be back.
I promise, OK?

53:43.433 --> 53:44.433
Okay.

53:57.874 --> 53:59.827
- What is it?
- Shh!

55:52.718 --> 55:55.298
I need to go get out.

56:03.471 --> 56:04.898
Phoebe!

56:06.474 --> 56:07.542
Hey, Phoebe!

56:09.777 --> 56:11.475
Look at this.

56:12.699 --> 56:14.296
It is your mom's.

56:15.738 --> 56:18.044
I think she would
like you to have it...

56:18.045 --> 56:20.665
for being such a brave girl.

56:23.036 --> 56:27.562
I thought you said, there
weren't any monsters until high school.

56:31.849 --> 56:34.858
I will be back, I promise!

56:35.779 --> 56:37.656
Stay here until I get back.

57:57.142 --> 57:59.299
Oh My God! Stop! Stop!

57:59.300 --> 58:01.380
Please stop!

58:02.720 --> 58:03.720
Oh my God!

58:06.040 --> 58:07.441
Oh, thank God!

58:08.603 --> 58:10.425
Markus, What are you doing here?

58:10.426 --> 58:12.886
Are you fucking trying anyone over?

58:12.888 --> 58:14.325
Drive to the house over there.

58:14.326 --> 58:15.976
God, you look like shit!

58:15.977 --> 58:16.837
Just do it,

58:16.838 --> 58:19.338
turn your lights
off so they won't see us.

58:20.661 --> 58:22.186
What are you doing?

58:22.187 --> 58:24.177
There're people out there
trying to kill us!

58:24.184 --> 58:25.528
They're out there right now.

58:25.529 --> 58:28.399
Why do you think I came
all the way out here?

58:31.734 --> 58:35.286
My God!
Relax, It's a joke.

58:35.299 --> 58:36.969
What are you, on something?

58:37.309 --> 58:40.020
Jesus, probably just a bunch
of kids playing a prank.

58:40.043 --> 58:41.646
Don't touch me.

58:41.647 --> 58:44.277
My God, You're such a freaking chick.

58:46.822 --> 58:47.822
Look...

58:48.860 --> 58:49.860
Kylie

58:51.251 --> 58:53.853
I knew about the video, OK?

58:53.885 --> 58:56.690
But look, I don't see
what the big deal is, OK?

58:56.691 --> 58:59.631
There's like a million
blow job videos out there.

59:00.644 --> 59:02.782
Why would you do that to me?

59:05.611 --> 59:07.313
To see if I could.

59:07.862 --> 59:10.805
This isn't all my fault, OK?
You were pretty easy prey.

59:10.873 --> 59:14.251
So listen, this is how
this is gonna go down:

59:14.432 --> 59:21.224
You are gonna tell principal Morris that
I had no idea about the camera.

59:21.725 --> 59:24.202
Otherwise I just don't
have anything to lose, Kylie.

59:24.479 --> 59:28.958
Which means there's nothing stopping
me from putting this online.

59:29.856 --> 59:32.240
Get's really good, around 4 or 3.

59:33.454 --> 59:35.484
Yeah, they like to
call it money shot.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.561
Get me off the hook with Morris,

59:37.562 --> 59:39.792
then you could personally
delete the video from my phone.

59:39.794 --> 59:41.235
No one will never see it.

59:41.512 --> 59:44.204
And you know, just to sweeten that deal

59:44.980 --> 59:48.402
I wouldn't say no if you
wanted to come back for more

59:52.537 --> 59:54.039
What the hell?

59:59.014 --> 01:00:00.627
- Drive, now!
- No big deal

01:00:02.584 --> 01:00:03.673
Go!

01:00:04.361 --> 01:00:06.555
- Holy crap!
- Go!

01:00:10.668 --> 01:00:13.127
Holy shit!

01:00:13.216 --> 01:00:16.595
Holy fucking goddamn motherfucking shit!

01:00:17.953 --> 01:00:21.812
You see that guy, piggy
he was fucking covered in bloodshed

01:00:22.156 --> 01:00:24.229
Grow some balls!

01:00:24.234 --> 01:00:26.462
Ouch. What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:00:26.463 --> 01:00:28.463
God, my eye!

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:29.470
Drive over there.

01:00:29.634 --> 01:00:32.127
- Fuck, you're crazy!
- Do it!

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:33.128
OK, OK!

01:00:41.588 --> 01:00:43.153
I'm going back in for the kids.

01:00:43.455 --> 01:00:46.932
Run the fuckers over if you
see them, but don't you take off on us.

01:00:46.937 --> 01:00:48.530
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:52.622
You trying take off on
us, and I will fucking destroy you.

01:00:52.623 --> 01:00:53.810
Do you understand me?

01:00:54.063 --> 01:00:56.714
I'll take this video,
bring it to the police,

01:00:56.715 --> 01:00:58.105
tell everyone it was you,

01:00:58.111 --> 01:01:02.878
And you'll spend the next 4 years
of your life, going down on guys...

01:01:02.884 --> 01:01:05.212
In jail showers for distributing
pornography of a minor.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.876
Got it?

01:01:56.836 --> 01:01:58.377
Sam!
Phoebe!

01:01:59.291 --> 01:02:01.048
We need to leave.

01:02:03.425 --> 01:02:04.962
Grab my hand.

01:02:05.436 --> 01:02:06.667
- You came back!
- I promised, didn't I?

01:02:06.668 --> 01:02:08.675
Come on!

01:02:08.676 --> 01:02:11.690
This is such a bad idea.

01:02:12.181 --> 01:02:13.771
Shit!

01:02:19.166 --> 01:02:20.681
Holy Christ!
Inside!

01:02:26.226 --> 01:02:27.675
Open the door!

01:02:42.057 --> 01:02:43.366
Markus?

01:02:48.624 --> 01:02:50.096
What are you doing?

01:02:51.407 --> 01:02:54.061
I'm doing stuff, Kylie.

01:02:55.228 --> 01:02:56.961
Get in the car!

01:02:57.633 --> 01:03:00.461
Car, I just got this detail
last week, Kylie.

01:03:00.745 --> 01:03:02.290
Get in the car!

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:05.857
No!

01:03:20.628 --> 01:03:22.328
- Shit!

01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:29.951
It's the police, they're
here to help us!

01:03:29.952 --> 01:03:31.292
Look out!

01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:24.166
Oh, little boy.

01:04:24.167 --> 01:04:25.384
Are you okay?

01:04:26.773 --> 01:04:30.863
Please, You have to help us.

01:04:31.694 --> 01:04:32.994
Huh?

01:04:38.299 --> 01:04:40.214
Can you untie me?

01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:45.249
Please.

01:04:53.451 --> 01:04:55.289
You like the bear?

01:04:55.298 --> 01:04:57.430
His name's Reynolds,
he is from England.

01:04:58.809 --> 01:05:00.350
I want to help you.

01:05:00.353 --> 01:05:02.737
Just Please tell me
what I can do...

01:05:02.738 --> 01:05:03.938
so much talking!

01:05:42.488 --> 01:05:44.639
You don't have to do this.

01:05:47.732 --> 01:05:50.570
I know that somewhere
in there, there's...

01:05:50.571 --> 01:05:53.691
there's a scared little
boy who needs of help.

01:05:55.222 --> 01:05:58.195
Can you please help us?

01:06:00.431 --> 01:06:01.752
Please help!

01:06:36.298 --> 01:06:38.116
Oh, yeah, alive.

01:07:27.155 --> 01:07:31.395
Dispatch, we have an officer
down, an officer down.

01:07:31.396 --> 01:07:34.386
1-21, is there a fault?

01:07:34.387 --> 01:07:36.247
Officer is not responding.

01:07:36.648 --> 01:07:40.548
All units be advised, Officer down in
number3-mindoro, Berkshire County...

01:08:04.961 --> 01:08:07.554
It's you or nothing.

01:08:10.272 --> 01:08:13.137
It's you or nothing.

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.479
Please help, Roberta!

01:08:56.559 --> 01:08:57.559
Kylie?

01:08:59.028 --> 01:09:02.764
They have us in a van,
They’re taking us somewhere.

01:09:04.582 --> 01:09:07.194
Kylie, I know you're
tired and you're hurting

01:09:07.196 --> 01:09:10.826
but I'm gonna ask you to keep
fighting a little longer.

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:13.809
You could've given up and left
without the children.

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:15.310
But you didn't.

01:09:15.406 --> 01:09:17.859
And now The police
are looking for you,

01:09:18.447 --> 01:09:20.908
But they're never
going to find you,

01:09:20.955 --> 01:09:24.577
'Cause all your calls were rerouted
to me.

01:09:25.611 --> 01:09:29.491
But I want to keep fighting
anyway, Kylie.

01:09:30.197 --> 01:09:33.596
'Cause it's just so much more fun.

01:09:48.486 --> 01:09:50.804
I'm gonna enjoy
breaking you, Kylie.

01:09:52.223 --> 01:09:54.279
It's gonna be so much fun!

01:10:39.275 --> 01:10:41.500
Who's having fun now, Roberta?

01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:52.961
Kylie?

01:12:02.169 --> 01:12:04.734
There's no use hiding from me.

01:13:43.435 --> 01:13:45.835
Sam, Phoebe!

01:13:40.722 --> 01:13:41.722
No!

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.995
You don't have to...

01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:16.432
But I want to.

01:14:24.652 --> 01:14:26.134
They're coming.

01:14:27.132 --> 01:14:29.628
I cut your fucking wires.

01:15:54.314 --> 01:15:55.316
Mom!

01:15:56.316 --> 01:15:57.484
Kylie!

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:07.119
How are you feeling?

01:16:08.393 --> 01:16:10.197
Happy to be alive.

01:16:17.915 --> 01:16:20.293
I'm so proud of you.

01:16:20.973 --> 01:16:22.716
You are a brave girl!

01:16:22.717 --> 01:16:25.607
You fought them off, all by yourself.

01:16:25.613 --> 01:16:28.436
Do The police know
anything more about them?

01:16:28.801 --> 01:16:33.127
They think that the device they used to
hijack your cell calls is the best chance.

01:16:33.867 --> 01:16:35.595
What about that boy?

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:39.847
He's awake but he hasn't spoken a word.
.

01:16:39.854 --> 01:16:42.281
They don't know what to do with him.

01:17:03.316 --> 01:17:05.170
Here for the boy.

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:08.931
Yeah, It's all yours.

01:18:05.923 --> 01:18:07.245
Hello?

01:18:29.786 --> 01:18:30.946
Oh my God!
