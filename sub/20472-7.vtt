WEBVTT

00:04.392 --> 00:07.026
Ugh, guys, come on.
You can't just throw

00:07.095 --> 00:09.462
trash on the ground.
What, were you raised

00:09.531 --> 00:12.499
in a barn?
No offense, Beth.

00:12.567 --> 00:14.601
I was born in a barn.
I was raised in a home

00:14.669 --> 00:16.236
for peculiar children.

00:22.110 --> 00:23.042
Yeah, so--

00:26.515 --> 00:28.381
What the?

00:28.450 --> 00:32.051
Carol Wendelson. Have you been
extreme couponing again?

00:32.119 --> 00:33.987
Yes, but before
you say anything,

00:34.055 --> 00:38.291
- I got all of this for just 62¢.
- Mom, why isn't this stuff

00:38.360 --> 00:40.560
- in your hoarding shed?
- Because my hoarding shed

00:40.629 --> 00:42.762
is full, and your dad said
if I get a second one, I'll

00:42.831 --> 00:45.665
- have to go see Dr. Jill again.
- Okay, well, you can't use

00:45.734 --> 00:47.867
the roof as your
personal storage unit.

00:47.936 --> 00:50.203
Why? Stosh the janitor
gave me a key in exchange

00:50.272 --> 00:52.906
for my Netflix password,
except now all they recommend

00:52.974 --> 00:55.708
is Polish shows
like "Pierogi in the City."

00:55.777 --> 00:59.479
- I'm such a Wladyslavka.
- Okay, well, just can you

00:59.548 --> 01:01.915
get this crap off the roof
before Greg finds out?

01:01.983 --> 01:03.616
You're never going to use
any of it anyway.

01:03.685 --> 01:05.485
Ooh, are those Venus razors?
Could I have one?

01:05.554 --> 01:08.454
Actually, they're "Wenus"
razors, but I got them

01:08.523 --> 01:10.223
for negative $40.00.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.033
Hey, Chuck,
you wanted to see me?

01:20.101 --> 01:22.268
Oh, yes, Carol. I have
a very important job for you.

01:22.337 --> 01:24.404
Finally, what do you
need me to do?

01:24.472 --> 01:26.539
Crack a witness?
Go undercover as a slut?

01:26.608 --> 01:28.241
I need you to go to my home

01:28.310 --> 01:30.910
- and let the cable guy in.
- Oh, I'd be happy to.

01:30.979 --> 01:33.112
I've never been to a
celebrity's house before.

01:33.181 --> 01:35.481
Well, except for Jesus.
He has a very exclusive

01:35.550 --> 01:39.752
party there
every Sunday, Chuck.

01:39.821 --> 01:41.955
Thank you, Carol.
I don't make a habit

01:42.023 --> 01:46.226
of letting people into my home,
but I know I can count on you.

01:46.294 --> 01:48.394
Oh, and one more thing:

01:48.463 --> 01:53.233
whatever you do,
don't open the red door.

01:54.736 --> 01:56.903
O--Okay then, bye.

02:00.775 --> 02:03.209
Ugh, I have had
the worst morning.

02:03.278 --> 02:05.945
Did your fancy Japanese toilet
go berserk again?

02:06.014 --> 02:09.481
No,Potti-San is fine.
My phone was hacked.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.849
They took it all: my personal
photos, my tasteful nudes,

02:12.849 --> 02:14.607
my footage from my GoPro thong.

02:14.607 --> 02:16.346
Oh, Portia, that's terrible.

02:16.558 --> 02:18.024
Yeah, I hear a lot
of big celebrities

02:18.093 --> 02:20.893
- have been getting hacked lately.
- Big celebrities, huh?

02:20.962 --> 02:23.830
Then my phone must've
been hacked, too.

02:23.898 --> 02:29.469
Yep, it says it: "Hacked Alert."
Aw, man, looks like

02:29.537 --> 02:32.305
- they're in the mainframe.
- I've gotta go see my lawyers,

02:32.374 --> 02:35.375
but will you guys please, please
not look at these photos?

02:35.443 --> 02:38.144
I can't stop strangers
from looking, but you guys?

02:38.213 --> 02:39.379
You're my friends.

02:39.447 --> 02:42.315
Greg, Chuck, Katie, Barf,

02:42.384 --> 02:47.086
Greg again, I wanna say... Lumpy?

02:47.155 --> 02:48.554
Thanks, guys.

02:51.526 --> 02:53.493
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you guys doing?

02:53.561 --> 02:57.196
Looking at Portia's nudes.
There's one of her with Tupac.

02:57.265 --> 03:00.433
- From last year?
- No, no! How would you all feel

03:00.502 --> 03:03.303
if your naked pictures were
out there for the world to see?

03:03.371 --> 03:06.172
I'd feel great.
I tried to submit to "Hustler,"

03:06.241 --> 03:08.041
but they said my bedroom
made them depressed.

03:08.109 --> 03:10.576
Yeah, chill out, Greg.
It's just boobies and vaginas.

03:10.645 --> 03:11.811
- Yeah.
- No, guys,

03:11.880 --> 03:13.880
Portia's privacy was stolen.

03:13.948 --> 03:17.116
Maybe you don't know what
that feels like, but I do.

03:17.185 --> 03:19.185
Katie, I had no idea.
What happened to you?

03:21.589 --> 03:23.456
I was raised
by Carol Wendelson.

03:23.525 --> 03:25.625
She read my diary.

03:25.694 --> 03:26.993
She listened in on
my phone calls.

03:27.062 --> 03:30.630
My freshman year roommate
was just a P.I. that she

03:30.699 --> 03:32.265
had hired-- I was like,
why is your student film

03:32.334 --> 03:34.467
just about everywhere I go,
you know?

03:34.536 --> 03:37.370
Katie's right.
We should respect Portia.

03:37.439 --> 03:39.238
She's our coworker
and our friend.

03:39.307 --> 03:42.809
She thinks my name is Barf,
which, yes, is my middle name,

03:42.877 --> 03:45.578
- but she doesn't know that.
- Phones away, people.

03:45.647 --> 03:46.746
Ugh.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.124 --> 03:59.392
Okay, there it is.
No big deal.

03:59.461 --> 04:02.195
All I have to do is keep
my mind off the red door.

04:02.263 --> 04:05.064
Just like that.
Ehh...

04:08.536 --> 04:10.036
Hi, mom.

04:10.105 --> 04:12.138
Oh, Katie,
I'm at Chuck's house,

04:12.207 --> 04:14.240
and there's this mysterious
red door, and he told me

04:14.309 --> 04:18.010
not to open it, but I really,
really, really want to.

04:18.079 --> 04:19.812
Mom, what are you doing
at Chuck's house?

04:19.880 --> 04:22.248
Trying not to open the red
door, keep up with me, Katie.

04:22.317 --> 04:24.283
Chuck trusts me,
and I don't wanna ruin it,

04:24.352 --> 04:27.687
but I need to know the secret.
I'm like that white-haired lady

04:27.756 --> 04:29.822
on Wackyleaks-- What's her name?
You know, she looks like

04:29.891 --> 04:32.825
- the Snow Queen in Narnio?
- Julian Assange.

04:32.894 --> 04:35.161
- No, no, that's not it.
- Mom, this might be hard

04:35.230 --> 04:38.097
for you to understand,
but people deserve privacy,

04:38.166 --> 04:40.133
which is why I convinced
the whole office not to look

04:40.201 --> 04:43.403
at Portia's hacked photos,
and honestly, it-- Mom?

04:43.471 --> 04:45.438
You're already looking
at them, aren't you?

04:45.507 --> 04:48.441
Oh, God, gossip, secrets,
that's the stuff.

04:48.510 --> 04:50.777
Oh, you mean you haven't
read any of these emails?

04:50.845 --> 04:53.379
- Not even the ones about you?
- Wait, I thought

04:53.448 --> 04:55.748
it was just pictures.
There's emails, too?

04:55.817 --> 04:57.650
So this is just
a treasure trove of things--

04:57.719 --> 05:00.420
not treasure, regular trove--
of things that Portia

05:00.488 --> 05:03.289
said about everybody?
Well, I'm not interested

05:03.358 --> 05:05.458
because no deets, no matter
how juicy, are worth

05:05.527 --> 05:09.128
betraying a coworker's trust.

05:09.197 --> 05:14.066
You're right, Pumpkin.
I'm not gonna open the red door.

05:14.135 --> 05:17.570
- I'm gonna be just like you.
- Yeah, like me.

05:17.639 --> 05:19.205
Okay, bye.

05:25.031 --> 05:28.000
_

05:32.480 --> 05:34.454
Hey, you know,
I think it's really great

05:34.468 --> 05:35.828
that we're not
reading Portia's emails.

05:35.839 --> 05:37.321
Could you just
real quick remind me why?

05:37.348 --> 05:40.149
Because, Katie,
we're better than that.

05:40.167 --> 05:45.103
Yes, yeah, exactly.
Hey, what's going on over there?

05:45.836 --> 05:48.236
Oh, I wanna look so bad.
Just think of

05:48.235 --> 05:50.168
the cool slang we could learn.
I could finally

05:50.237 --> 05:52.671
stop saying,
"I'm gellin' like Magellan."

05:52.740 --> 05:56.108
What, ugh, Greg,
that's not a reason to look.

05:56.176 --> 05:59.111
A reason to look would be
to make sure that Portia

05:59.179 --> 06:00.779
didn't say anything
to hurt the show.

06:00.848 --> 06:02.214
- Oh, God, that's perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

06:02.282 --> 06:05.550
I mean, oh, God,
that's ethical.

06:05.619 --> 06:06.685
Mm-hmm.

06:06.754 --> 06:08.520
This is crazy.
Who knew Portia

06:08.589 --> 06:10.856
was friends with Beyoncé?
And who knew Beyoncé's email

06:10.924 --> 06:14.393
was "FunMusicGal@hotmail"?
- Ooh, Portia says

06:14.461 --> 06:16.428
a lot of mean stuff about Chuck.

06:16.497 --> 06:19.031
"Chuck is an old loser"?

06:19.099 --> 06:21.933
Oh, here's a nice one:
"Chuck looks like George Clooney

06:22.002 --> 06:23.769
"if George Clooney were
made out of diarrhea."

06:23.837 --> 06:25.470
- Okay.
- God, she's vicious.

06:25.539 --> 06:26.938
- Mm.
- Do you wanna see

06:27.007 --> 06:29.908
- what she says about you?
- Yeah. Wait, I wanna do it.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.280
Whoa, wait,
oh, my gosh, what's this?

06:35.349 --> 06:38.316
"Office goss," okay,
"They're not fooling anyone.

06:38.385 --> 06:41.286
"Greg and Katie
are totally boning."

06:43.791 --> 06:45.590
Do our chums
think we're snogging?

06:45.659 --> 06:49.094
What? Wh-- Speak English!
Does Portia think that?

06:49.163 --> 06:51.396
- Does everyone think that?
- I have a girlfriend.

06:51.465 --> 06:53.699
- And I'm not a homewrecker.
- Don't overreact.

06:53.767 --> 06:55.233
- Okay.
- We've only been in this room

06:55.302 --> 06:57.636
with the door locked for--
Oh, God, 3 hours.

06:57.705 --> 06:59.504
Oh, my God, I have to
sneak out of here.

06:59.573 --> 07:01.540
Do you think I could fit
through the air ducts?

07:01.608 --> 07:04.009
Okay, I'm not gonna
actually do it, but there's

07:04.078 --> 07:06.678
only one right answer, and it's
"Yes, you can fit, Katie."

07:08.015 --> 07:10.048
Thank you very much.

07:10.117 --> 07:11.883
Well, I did it.

07:11.952 --> 07:15.654
I didn't open the red door.
Man, I'm the best.

07:24.631 --> 07:28.400
No!

07:28.469 --> 07:32.037
No!

07:32.106 --> 07:33.238
Chuck?

07:33.307 --> 07:36.842
You were in here the whole time?
Chuck?

07:49.590 --> 07:52.391
So everything went fine. Nothing
weird happened. Good-bye.

07:52.459 --> 07:54.860
- You opened it, didn't you?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

07:54.929 --> 07:56.495
If you didn't want
anybody to open it,

07:56.564 --> 07:58.330
why would you paint it red?

07:58.399 --> 07:59.965
Just leave it
regular door colored.

08:00.034 --> 08:03.068
What are you implying?
That I wanted you to open it?

08:03.137 --> 08:07.539
Why, so I could air my secret
shame finally and tell my story?

08:07.608 --> 08:11.910
That's insane.
The year was 1996...

08:13.347 --> 08:14.980
And there you have it:
Erik and Lyle Menendez

08:15.049 --> 08:17.583
convicted of murder
in the first degree.

08:17.651 --> 08:20.485
<i>I just reported the crap
out of the Menendez brothers,</i>

08:20.554 --> 08:23.822
<i>and I was the heir apparent
for the "Nightly News" desk.</i>

08:23.891 --> 08:26.558
<i>Women wanted to be with me,
and men wanted to</i>

08:26.627 --> 08:28.493
<i>hear news from me.</i>

08:28.562 --> 08:30.462
Whoo!

08:30.531 --> 08:32.530
<i>And then, just when I thought
things couldn't possibly</i>

08:32.600 --> 08:36.335
<i>get better, I got a call
from a very special lady.</i>

08:36.403 --> 08:38.035
Madame Tussauds?

08:38.105 --> 08:39.804
<i>It was like</i>

08:39.873 --> 08:44.009
<i>I had achieved immortality.
There I was between Kurt Cobain</i>

08:44.078 --> 08:47.245
<i>and Austin Powers.
People came from far and wide</i>

08:47.314 --> 08:51.483
<i>to see my statue because
they thought I was somebody.</i>

08:51.552 --> 08:57.022
<i>And then, a few years later,
something changed.</i>

08:57.091 --> 08:59.625
<i>I got passed over for
the "Nightly News" desk.</i>

08:59.693 --> 09:01.360
Thank you.
<i>But that wasn't</i>

09:01.428 --> 09:04.463
<i>the worst of it, Carol.
I was feeling pretty low,</i>

09:04.531 --> 09:08.967
<i>so I decided to take my date
to Madame Tussauds.</i>

09:09.036 --> 09:13.071
<i>When I got there, I discovered
that I'd been replaced.</i>

09:21.348 --> 09:25.384
<i>I stood there for hours.
Luckily, I wasn't the only</i>

09:25.452 --> 09:28.920
<i>celebrity pretending to be
his own wax statue that day.</i>

09:28.989 --> 09:31.923
Scott Baio and I
became great friends.

09:31.992 --> 09:34.760
Both of us gigantic losers.

09:34.828 --> 09:36.595
So they gave you your statue?

09:36.664 --> 09:39.164
No, I bought it.
They were gonna melt it

09:39.233 --> 09:41.199
into a gray ball
with Milli Vanilli.

09:41.268 --> 09:43.235
I couldn't let that happen.
I always thought that

09:43.303 --> 09:45.604
once I was back on top,
Madame Tussauds was gonna

09:45.673 --> 09:49.174
- want me again.
- And she will.

09:49.243 --> 09:52.611
Chuck, now that
we're admitting things, um,

09:52.680 --> 09:55.547
your head kind of fell off.
Please, don't be mad at me.

09:55.616 --> 09:58.050
I stuck it back on with
a scoop of your crotch wax.

09:58.118 --> 10:00.552
I'm not mad, Carol.
I should've gotten rid of

10:00.621 --> 10:02.988
that thing years ago.
That statue's now just

10:03.057 --> 10:06.958
a sad reminder of the glory
I never had. I can't even

10:07.027 --> 10:10.762
- get hacked. It's over.
- Don't you say that.

10:10.831 --> 10:14.299
- The Menendezes could kill again.
- I want you to destroy

10:14.368 --> 10:16.635
that thing, Carol.
I never want to see it again.

10:16.704 --> 10:19.571
Chuck, are you sure?
It could be useful.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.339
You could try out
new haircuts on it

10:21.408 --> 10:23.975
- before you take the plunge.
- I have someone for that.

10:24.044 --> 10:26.311
Carol, kill him.

10:30.916 --> 10:33.886
Ugh, great,
I'm in the same room as Greg.

10:34.157 --> 10:36.323
That stinks 'cause all he does
is talks about it how much

10:36.392 --> 10:39.293
he loves his girlfriend,
and all I do is respect that.

10:39.362 --> 10:40.828
You know what?
Just stay away from me,

10:40.897 --> 10:43.197
- like I like.
- All right, that's the one

10:43.266 --> 10:45.666
thing we can agree on.
That's it.

10:45.735 --> 10:48.436
Anyway, how's it going,
lunch crew?

10:48.504 --> 10:50.304
- Did you just wink at her?
- Yeah, why are you guys

10:50.373 --> 10:53.007
acting so weird?

10:53.076 --> 10:56.644
Okay, just to nip any rumors
in the bud, Katie and I

10:56.712 --> 10:59.013
are coworkers, all right?
Nothing more.

10:59.082 --> 11:01.015
Mm-mm, Greg's got a
girlfriend, I have

11:01.084 --> 11:03.451
a fun Bumble presence.
The point is, despite whatever

11:03.519 --> 11:05.786
you guys have heard,
we are not sleeping together.

11:05.855 --> 11:07.354
- No one thinks
you're sleeping together.

11:07.423 --> 11:09.490
I thought you were
brother and sister.

11:09.559 --> 11:12.026
I don't think about either
of you sleeping with anyone.

11:12.095 --> 11:14.428
Katie, you're always,
like, doing puzzles.

11:14.497 --> 11:16.630
Some say sex
is the ultimate puzzle.

11:16.699 --> 11:19.600
Yeah, see?
You say stuff like that.

11:19.669 --> 11:22.670
Greg, can you even have sex?
You told me yourself

11:22.738 --> 11:25.973
- you don't have genitals.
- No, I did not.

11:26.042 --> 11:28.442
Yeah, you did.
You came up to me and said,

11:28.511 --> 11:30.111
"Beth, I have nothing
down there.

11:30.179 --> 11:32.780
"I'm completely smooth,
like a Ken doll."

11:32.849 --> 11:35.182
Do you not remember that?

11:35.251 --> 11:37.351
- That never happened.
- Ugh.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.887
Oh, boy.
I don't know who to believe.

11:39.956 --> 11:42.990
- Okay, come on, let's just go.
- But Katie, I do have genitals.

11:43.059 --> 11:45.459
Stop saying "genitals."
You're making it worse.

11:48.030 --> 11:50.397
Oh, I have to
leave you, Chuck.

11:50.466 --> 11:51.899
It's what the other Chuck wants.

11:59.475 --> 12:03.077
Oh, I can't do it.
Why is this so hard?

12:04.547 --> 12:08.182
Come on, buddy.
Let's go.

12:10.353 --> 12:13.387
Okay, you'll be safe up here.
I put you next to

12:13.456 --> 12:15.222
the Yankee candles because
I thought you'd have

12:15.291 --> 12:18.459
a lot in common.

12:18.528 --> 12:22.363
Oh, that's good.
Enjoy the view.

12:22.431 --> 12:25.099
Man, I'm so relieved no one
had the wrong idea about us.

12:25.168 --> 12:27.768
Oh, me too.
I hate rumors.

12:27.837 --> 12:29.069
In middle school,
there was this one

12:29.138 --> 12:31.238
going around about me
that I had fleas.

12:31.307 --> 12:34.041
- Try a flea, singular.
- I guess we had

12:34.110 --> 12:35.643
- nothing to worry about, then.
- Yeah.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.311
I mean, they literally laughed
at the idea of us

12:37.380 --> 12:39.647
having sex with
each other, or anyone.

12:39.715 --> 12:42.917
I guess that's what
we wanted though... right?

12:42.985 --> 12:45.653
- Right.
- Yeah.

12:45.721 --> 12:46.954
Oh, well.
Back to work.

12:47.023 --> 12:48.822
We've called
an emergency meeting.

12:48.891 --> 12:50.858
We will have you guys know
that we are not

12:50.927 --> 12:53.761
sleeping together, but we are
viable candidates for it.

12:53.829 --> 12:55.896
- Ew.
- It's not "ew."

12:55.965 --> 13:00.067
- It's "hmm."
- I am not unattractive.

13:00.136 --> 13:02.636
I've been approached numerous
times in coffee shops by women,

13:02.705 --> 13:04.038
and only twice was that
because they thought

13:04.106 --> 13:05.940
- I was their lost child.
- Yeah, and you guys

13:06.008 --> 13:07.975
only know work Katie.
You've never met Katie

13:08.044 --> 13:11.912
after dark with her wet hair
and her boobs all flying around.

13:11.981 --> 13:13.647
This has nothing
to do with work.

13:13.716 --> 13:15.849
Beth and Justin flirt,
and we all love that.

13:16.068 --> 13:18.068
We're like Carrie
and Mr. Bigaslavka from

13:18.287 --> 13:20.287
"Pierogi in the City."

13:20.356 --> 13:21.589
- Cut it out.
- You cut it out.

13:21.657 --> 13:23.257
- Stop.
- You stop.

13:23.326 --> 13:25.159
- You're bad.
- Well, you know who doesn't

13:25.228 --> 13:27.661
think the idea of us
is crazy? Portia.

13:27.730 --> 13:29.396
Since when?
Portia thinks Katie

13:29.465 --> 13:32.299
- is Greg doing a Mrs. Doubtfire.
- Oh, really?

13:32.368 --> 13:34.101
Well, in Portia's
hacked emails--

13:34.170 --> 13:36.570
it's-- that we looked at

13:36.639 --> 13:40.541
for work reasons--
She said, "Katie and Greg

13:40.610 --> 13:44.979
are totally boning."
Boo-yah!

13:45.047 --> 13:47.248
Nope, no, that wasn't--
Nope, that's not good.

13:47.316 --> 13:48.816
Oh, my God,
I made two, I made two.

13:48.884 --> 13:50.417
Let me-- Let me do it.
Oh, that's at Rushmore.

13:50.486 --> 13:53.187
- Yeah, can you fix that?
- What the hell are you doing?

13:53.256 --> 13:55.055
Portia, I know
what this looks like--

13:55.124 --> 13:57.157
But we were doing it
for a very good reason.

13:57.226 --> 13:59.994
We were trying to prove
to everyone that we're sexy.

14:00.062 --> 14:03.264
Greg, this is not okay.
There are things in those emails

14:03.332 --> 14:05.899
- that certain people cannot see.
- Hey, Chuck's on the roof.

14:05.968 --> 14:08.002
- I think he's gonna jump.
- Oh, my God, he probably read

14:08.070 --> 14:10.271
all the terrible things
I said about him.

14:12.108 --> 14:15.409
Hey, where's everybody going?
Oh, is this a fun run?

14:15.478 --> 14:18.412
Because my ankle hurts,
but I still want a t-shirt.

14:18.481 --> 14:19.913
Chuck's on the roof.
He's gonna jump.

14:19.982 --> 14:24.451
Oh, oh.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.753
Ooh...

14:27.056 --> 14:28.389
Ooh.

14:30.439 --> 14:33.274
Hey, Chuck.
I have a question for you.

14:33.276 --> 14:36.844
- Would you rather--
- Fly or be invisible? Fly.

14:36.852 --> 14:39.385
Sure, you can't walk right into
the ladies' locker room,

14:39.409 --> 14:41.718
but you can hover
near the ceiling.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.184
Yeah, nope, I was gonna ask
if you would rather

14:44.253 --> 14:46.820
everyone know that you have
a wax figure of yourself

14:46.889 --> 14:52.326
or everyone think that
you are trying to end your life.

14:53.462 --> 14:54.861
- Neither, Carol.
- Okay, good to know

14:54.930 --> 14:58.398
- for next time.
- Hey, what did you do?

14:58.467 --> 15:01.602
I... I... I...

15:01.670 --> 15:05.539
Chuck, don't do this.
There's so much to live for.

15:05.608 --> 15:08.375
Like--
Does he have a wife?

15:08.444 --> 15:11.912
Ugh.
Chuck, do not pay attention

15:11.981 --> 15:15.282
to Portia's emails.
She thought Greg and I

15:15.351 --> 15:18.285
were sleeping together,
which is totally not true,

15:18.354 --> 15:21.421
- but not unrealistic.
- Eww.

15:21.490 --> 15:23.724
- What are you talking about?
- Your email.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.926
"They're not fooling anyone.
Greg and Katie

15:25.995 --> 15:29.429
- "are totally boning."
- Ooh, that must've been

15:29.498 --> 15:31.198
my autocorrect.
I meant to say

15:31.267 --> 15:33.634
"Greg and Katie
are totally boring."

15:33.702 --> 15:35.369
Okay, that makes sense.

15:35.437 --> 15:37.304
Now I get it.
'Cause Greg told all of us

15:37.373 --> 15:39.306
- that he has no genitals.
- I heard that.

15:39.375 --> 15:41.208
I can prove this
to you very eas--

15:41.277 --> 15:42.709
Chuck locked the door
to the roof.

15:42.778 --> 15:45.579
What? Wait, my mom has a key.
Keep talking to him,

15:45.648 --> 15:47.381
I'll find her.

15:47.449 --> 15:49.716
This is humiliating.
How am I gonna explain this?

15:49.785 --> 15:52.185
What if I tell everyone
that I made the statue

15:52.254 --> 15:54.621
because I'm in love with you?
I made it with wax from

15:54.690 --> 15:56.590
- those little round cheeses.
- Why didn't you just

15:56.659 --> 15:58.158
get rid of him
like I asked you to?

15:58.227 --> 15:59.660
I don't know--
because he's not trash.

15:59.728 --> 16:01.428
What if you get
the "Nightly News" desk,

16:01.497 --> 16:03.630
- and you need him again?
- Not gonna happen, Carol.

16:03.699 --> 16:05.832
- That ship has sailed.
- Oh, well, if it's too late

16:05.901 --> 16:08.335
for you then
what does that mean for me?

16:08.404 --> 16:11.338
- What are you talking about?
- Maybe that's why

16:11.407 --> 16:14.508
I couldn't throw him away,
because I don't want to believe

16:14.576 --> 16:17.277
that dreams
have expiration dates.

16:17.346 --> 16:21.748
I'm a 60-year-old intern, Chuck.
I want a big career.

16:21.817 --> 16:24.351
I wanna be on camera one day.

16:24.420 --> 16:26.320
But if you, Chuck Pierce,

16:26.388 --> 16:29.956
one of the greatest
newsmen ever to live,

16:30.025 --> 16:33.860
if you can't get the job
you've always wanted,

16:33.929 --> 16:35.896
then what chance do I have?

16:39.568 --> 16:41.601
Chuck, there's so much
to live for.

16:41.670 --> 16:43.970
A pet, maybe, a kid,
if you have one,

16:44.039 --> 16:46.473
whatever holidays
you celebrate,

16:46.542 --> 16:49.276
being on Wikipedia, I hope.

16:49.345 --> 16:51.878
- What? That ain't gonna work.
- Come on.

16:51.947 --> 16:54.848
Just please, don't jump.
We all really,

16:54.917 --> 16:58.652
- really, care about you, Chuck.
- Wait, did you hear that?

16:58.721 --> 17:01.388
Hey, Chuck, it's me, Justin.
Hey, I just wanna tell you

17:01.457 --> 17:04.858
how much you mean to me.
You know, I never had a dad.

17:04.926 --> 17:07.394
This guy, always
with the dad stuff.

17:07.463 --> 17:10.030
But thanks to you,
now I have a hero.

17:11.532 --> 17:13.967
You're an inspiration, Chuck.
When I was a kid,

17:14.036 --> 17:17.037
you came and spoke at my school,
and, the very next day,

17:17.106 --> 17:20.840
my hot teacher came in and said
you stole her underwear.

17:20.909 --> 17:25.645
I named my dog after you.
Well, Chuck Norris,

17:25.714 --> 17:27.881
- but--but still.
- Chuck, I've always

17:27.950 --> 17:30.917
admired you.
Remember your stalker, Lorraine?

17:30.986 --> 17:32.652
That was me.

17:32.721 --> 17:35.322
Listen to that.

17:35.391 --> 17:38.825
All those people care about you.

17:38.894 --> 17:41.361
- I feel like Tom Sawyer.
- Like you're

17:41.430 --> 17:42.996
- at your own funeral.
- No, like

17:43.065 --> 17:46.600
- I'm an amazing song by Rush.
- Chuck, the only reason

17:46.668 --> 17:51.671
I give you such a hard time
is because I'm jealous.

17:51.740 --> 17:55.342
You're smart and accomplished
and you must weigh like nothing

17:55.411 --> 17:56.710
because I just saw
Carol carrying you

17:56.779 --> 17:58.445
through the parking lot.

17:58.514 --> 18:01.948
The point is everybody
looks up to you.

18:02.017 --> 18:05.952
And I guess I do too.

18:06.021 --> 18:08.422
never knew
she felt that way.

18:08.490 --> 18:10.724
I never knew any of them did.

18:10.793 --> 18:14.294
All those people down there,
they think you're somebody,

18:14.363 --> 18:16.663
even if Madame Tussaud doesn't.

18:18.867 --> 18:22.903
Aww, here, have a Klonex,
but don't get it wet because

18:22.971 --> 18:25.806
it crumbles into dust.

18:25.874 --> 18:27.674
There you are.

18:27.743 --> 18:30.610
- What the hell is happening?
- Well, what does it look like?

18:30.679 --> 18:32.479
Your mother went through
a red door in my house,

18:32.548 --> 18:34.614
she saw my statue there,
she brought it up here,

18:34.683 --> 18:36.483
now everyone thinks
I'm trying to kill myself.

18:36.552 --> 18:39.820
Is there anything else
you need explained, detective?

18:39.888 --> 18:42.022
What? Well, take it down!

18:44.426 --> 18:46.493
Hey, look,
Katie's trying to save Chuck!

18:46.562 --> 18:48.094
Oh, she's a hero!

18:48.163 --> 18:49.663
Yeah, Katie!

18:49.731 --> 18:52.966
How did you lift this thing?

18:53.035 --> 18:55.101
No, no, no, no, no, no!

18:55.170 --> 18:57.437
Oh, my God.

18:58.474 --> 19:01.675
It's okay!
I'm alive.

19:01.743 --> 19:04.678
That's because
you all believed in me.

19:04.746 --> 19:07.614
Give yourselves
a big round of applause.

19:11.186 --> 19:12.853
There you go.

19:12.921 --> 19:16.590
Now get back to work.
We have a show in 10 minutes.

19:16.658 --> 19:20.026
Come on, move it along.
Get back to your little offices,

19:20.095 --> 19:23.463
- your little holes.
- You see, mom?

19:23.532 --> 19:27.367
That is why you never
open the red door.

19:27.436 --> 19:30.742
Katie, once again,
you couldn't be more wrong.

19:34.762 --> 19:37.520
Carol, thank you
for opening the red door

19:37.606 --> 19:42.109
and for reminding me that it's
not too late, not for any of us.

19:42.177 --> 19:46.780
Maybe-- Maybe dreams don't have
an expiration date,

19:46.849 --> 19:51.852
unlike these 6,000 tubes
of Crust flavor-free teethpaste.

19:52.431 --> 19:55.455
Could you please get
this garbage off the roof?

20:01.273 --> 20:03.340
Ah, what a day.
I can't believe I made

20:03.409 --> 20:05.776
- all the right decisions.
- Aw, good for you, Mom.

20:05.844 --> 20:07.811
- Ahh.
- I did not.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.379
I should never have read
Portia's emails.

20:09.448 --> 20:11.014
Did you see the one
about you and Greg?

20:11.083 --> 20:13.116
- That wasn't true, right?
- No, but why is that

20:13.185 --> 20:15.953
so hard to believe?
I mean, I'm a sexy girl,

20:16.021 --> 20:18.488
right, Mommy?
Ew, right, abort, good-bye forever.

20:18.557 --> 20:20.324
Geez, what are you getting
so worked up about

20:20.392 --> 20:23.393
if it wasn't true? Ooh.

20:23.462 --> 20:25.529
Oh, don't "ooh."

20:25.598 --> 20:27.898
Let me ask you a question:
What would've happened if

20:27.967 --> 20:31.301
Portia's email had read "Katie
and Justin are totally boning"?

20:31.370 --> 20:33.403
- I would've laughed it off.
- And what did you do today?

20:33.472 --> 20:34.972
I freaked out
for like 9 hours.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.341
- You wanna bone Greg!
- Oh, my God,

20:37.409 --> 20:40.110
- abort, good-bye forever.
- You mark my words,

20:40.179 --> 20:42.246
your babies are gonna have
the cutest accents.

20:42.314 --> 20:44.548
That's not how that works,
and you are insane.

20:44.617 --> 20:46.416
Wait, gov'nah, would you

20:46.485 --> 20:49.319
like a cup of tea, Granny?

20:51.390 --> 20:54.424
Oh, my God, that thing
is so creepy.

20:54.493 --> 20:56.827
Why didn't anybody
throw this away?

20:56.895 --> 20:59.429
Hey, get off me!

20:59.498 --> 21:01.331
I'm waiting for my Uber.

21:03.802 --> 21:04.901
I'm sorry, sir.
