10:59.093 --> 11:00.094
I'm kidding.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.878
So the spell takes what,

11:01.922 --> 11:03.924
a day to kick in?

11:03.967 --> 11:05.534
It's almost dawn.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.492
You say there's no antidote.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.451
You better get to a lab
and get to it.

11:09.494 --> 11:12.889
Because I'm not turning you
into a DJ.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.935
No.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.893
You won't like the new you.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.984
Unless you have a secret dream
to live in a moving box.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.247

button, okay?

11:36.217 --> 11:37.827
- Todd.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.743
How long have you been awake?

11:40.787 --> 11:42.353
- We need to get you some help.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.400
- No. And what you just saw
dies with you.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.749

12:04.114 --> 12:06.029
There is an urgent matter.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.687
- An urgent poacher?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.167
- Who claims to be
the High King.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.516
- So an urgent, insane poacher.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.039
- Was my first thought.
- Until?

12:16.083 --> 12:18.520
- The name...was uttered.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.189

who we are not talking about.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.824

this goat god, Amber?

13:01.868 --> 13:03.217

- Whatevs.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.568
Said I had to get here
quick and dirty.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.396
- The reports are true.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.180
Ember has indeed
returned to Fillory.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.747
- Miraculously risen
from the dead.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.141
- Look. If you know
where this Ember is--

13:14.184 --> 13:15.751
- We don't, is the problem.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.668
We don't want to find him.
We have to.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.844
Something's happened
since his return.

13:23.715 --> 13:26.414
- Oh, I'm nodding so you hurry

13:26.457 --> 13:29.852
and you get to something
I actually understand.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.636
- Oh.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.421
Our air

13:33.464 --> 13:35.249
has always been graced

13:35.292 --> 13:37.120
with what you on Earth call

13:37.164 --> 13:38.600
opium.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.428
But now it's saturated.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.560
For some it's tolerable.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.388
Some get quite giddy,

13:44.432 --> 13:47.217
a few succumb to sleep
at the most inconvenient times,

13:47.261 --> 13:49.393
and then there are those who...

13:49.437 --> 13:50.568
- Dance.

13:50.612 --> 13:51.656
In the nude.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.571
- It sounds lighthearted,

13:53.615 --> 13:56.270
but it's actually resulted
in a number of deaths,

13:56.313 --> 13:58.663
mainly in falling asleep
in the wrong place

13:58.707 --> 13:59.926
at the wrong time.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.275
- Trampled in the middle
of the road

14:01.318 --> 14:02.711
being the most common.

14:02.754 --> 14:05.757
Uh, however, a dancer
did die of exposure

14:05.801 --> 14:07.585
on a glacier, though, uh,

14:07.629 --> 14:10.153
by all accounts,
quite gracefully.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.155
- Magic is now rationed.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.896
And none of it is powerful
enough to reverse this.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.464
And since it coincides
with Ember's return...

14:16.507 --> 14:18.945
- His glorious resurrection
and divine rule!

14:18.988 --> 14:21.512
- We hope.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.644
We've come to believe

14:22.687 --> 14:23.906
that this is his doing.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.430
And perhaps if he could be told

14:26.474 --> 14:27.736
of the damage it's causing,

14:27.779 --> 14:30.217
he could be convinced
to reverse this.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.479
- Guys.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.220
I need to stress

14:33.263 --> 14:35.439
how much I don't give a shit.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.832
- Oh.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.399
- But he's dodging you

14:38.442 --> 14:40.488
and he wants me.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.490
So let's find the fucker.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.413

14:52.456 --> 14:53.849
I think I'm flunking out.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.633
- Oh, first year nerves,
totally normal.

14:55.677 --> 14:56.939
- No, no, no, I am literally
failing everything.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.636
I mean, if I could
just pass one--

14:58.680 --> 14:59.681
- And somebody told you
I have a cheating spell.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.204
- Yes.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.205
- Okay, I will hook you up
right now.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.554
I'm trying not to freak.

15:03.598 --> 15:04.686
- What's wrong?
- I can't tell you.

15:04.729 --> 15:05.948
- Okay.
- I promised.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.689
- Right.
- Dean Fogg is leaving. Shit!

15:07.732 --> 15:08.690
Why did I just say that?

15:08.733 --> 15:10.344
Because it's too much.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.693
Why do I have to be
the only one who knows?

15:11.736 --> 15:13.825
- Wait, he's leaving?
Why?

15:13.869 --> 15:15.653
- Oh, believe me,
it is not his choice.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.525
See, there's this
Hedge Witch, and she--

15:17.568 --> 15:20.223
Dean Fogg, hi!
Sorry I'm late.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.964
I will give you every
cheating spell I have

15:22.008 --> 15:23.400
if you please don't
repeat this, okay?

15:23.444 --> 15:24.967
Great. Thanks.
It's gonna be fine.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.795
Oh, my God,
this is horrible.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.492
So even after you're gone,

15:28.536 --> 15:30.364
nothing about Marina
can go in the memoir?

15:30.407 --> 15:31.713
- Write or breathe
a single word

15:31.756 --> 15:33.497
and there will be blood
on your hands.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.978
But the outstanding business
I'm attending to today

15:36.022 --> 15:38.589
should be recorded
in minute detail.

15:38.633 --> 15:39.721
Walter.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.375
[chuckling] Walter.

15:41.418 --> 15:44.247
You're the best drinking
companion I've ever had.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.640
- Thanks.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.381
I mean, we only drank
together twice.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.513
- I'm a high-functioning
alcoholic, Walter.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.863
We prefer to do
our serious drinking alone.

15:51.907 --> 15:54.388
So that when we weep,
we can wallow in self-loathing

15:54.431 --> 15:55.389
without embarrassment.

15:55.432 --> 15:56.564
Did you get that, Todd?

15:56.607 --> 15:58.305

- Excellent.

of 1977 Hollcroft single malt

Enjoy, my dear friend.

It's not your fault
I'm always broke, Ashley.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.364
I'm a degenerate gambler
who can use magic

16:14.408 --> 16:15.757
to alter the outcome
of any game.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.541
But then I couldn't relive
the secret shame

16:17.585 --> 16:19.065

two years old.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.631

moment of that.

- You're a cutthroat bookie.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.598
- Gold.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.817
- Magic has been a brutal
series of disappointments.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.689
And after having
lived 40 timelines,

16:34.732 --> 16:37.431
39 of which range
from the comically horrendous

16:37.474 --> 16:38.867
to the apocalyptically absurd,

16:38.910 --> 16:42.479
to find it was all
for nothing, well...

16:42.523 --> 16:46.701
leaving this life
actually feels liberating.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.356

I've ever known.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.030
Of course I could never
tell her that

of intimacy horrify me.

I shouldn't tell you this.

have walked in and said that.

an explanation.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.697
My life is mostly made up

I'm not looking

to help these students

18:50.477 --> 18:52.261
can you tell me who they are?

18:54.045 --> 18:56.787
- Their lives
were in grave danger.

18:56.831 --> 18:59.268
I cast a spell that erased
their identities

anything you can do?

- Well, if I reveal that
the spell can be reversed,

19:11.628 --> 19:14.588
then someone would reverse
the spell on my students,
