00:06.528 --> 00:06.745
.

00:06.789 --> 00:09.052
- Previously on
"The Magicians."

00:10.227 --> 00:10.271
- Alice is fine.
Depressed.

00:10.793 --> 00:11.402
Surly.

00:12.447 --> 00:13.056
Still asking to see you again.

00:14.057 --> 00:14.579
- She's fixated on the thing

00:15.798 --> 00:16.233
she says she saw
in the Castle.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.496
She's worried
about her friends.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.847
- I can't think of anyone
better protected than they.

00:21.891 --> 00:25.112
They must stay where they are
as they are.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.591
- They'll be fine.

00:26.635 --> 00:30.204
Your spellwork was
was masterful.

00:32.423 --> 00:35.209
[high-pitched whine]

00:36.427 --> 00:37.820
- There's something
you need to know

00:37.863 --> 00:39.778
and as soon as I start
telling you about this,

00:39.822 --> 00:42.390
bad shit is gonna start
flying at our heads.

00:42.433 --> 00:45.219
[glass shattering,
electricity sparking]

00:45.262 --> 00:47.569
- So how do we figure out
who we really are?

00:47.612 --> 00:49.397
- Hi. I'm Marina.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.789
I'm here to help.

00:50.833 --> 00:54.097
- So you're like
some powerful, benevolent

00:54.141 --> 00:55.316
White Witch?

00:55.359 --> 00:56.447
- Uh-huh.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.754
Let's take a peek underneath

00:58.797 --> 01:00.408
and see what you
really look like.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.540
[all coughing, gagging]

01:02.584 --> 01:03.541
- [gagging]

01:03.585 --> 01:05.108
- Fix it.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.632
- I don't know what
you want me to fix!

01:07.676 --> 01:09.591
- Whatever the matter is
in Fillory!

01:09.634 --> 01:11.767
- [screaming] Hello?

01:11.810 --> 01:13.682
Hello?!

01:13.725 --> 01:16.163
[dramatic musical sting]

01:16.206 --> 01:19.731
[tense percussive music]

01:19.775 --> 01:25.607
â™ª

01:25.650 --> 01:27.217
- Old.

01:27.261 --> 01:30.438
Things get old so fast,
don't they?

01:30.481 --> 01:32.266
- Sorry, but where are we?

01:32.309 --> 01:34.181
- I told you, Greece.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.791
- Right, right.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.837
- This is the temple of the god
we are summoning.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.361
Enyalius.

01:40.404 --> 01:41.840
God of war.

01:42.841 --> 01:44.495
- Thought that was Ares.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.802
- [chuckles]

01:46.845 --> 01:48.804
Say that when you see him.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.719
It makes him so mad.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.809
So okay. Go in the woods.

01:53.852 --> 01:55.463
Get a pig.

01:55.506 --> 01:56.464
- Excuse me?

01:56.507 --> 01:57.465
- A wild pig.

01:57.508 --> 01:58.988
The younger the better.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.294
- Sorry, I don't mean
to be difficult,

02:00.337 --> 02:02.644
but couldn't you
just conjure one?

02:03.819 --> 02:05.560
- Hmm, no.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.736
It has to be caught
with human hands

02:07.779 --> 02:10.521
and stained with human effort.

02:10.565 --> 02:11.914
You know, that, that stuff

02:11.957 --> 02:13.611
that comes out of your skin.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.310
- Sweat?

02:16.353 --> 02:17.528
- Hurry.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.879
- [coughing]

02:20.923 --> 02:22.490
What the fuck did you do?

02:22.533 --> 02:23.795
- I didn't do anything.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.754
That spell's a cunt with fangs.

02:25.797 --> 02:28.365
- I thought your amulet
was supposed to protect us.

02:28.409 --> 02:31.020
- It did. You're alive
and welcome, asshole.

02:31.063 --> 02:34.676
- Well, great, that didn't work
and we're back to square one.

02:34.719 --> 02:37.809
[phone buzzing]

02:40.638 --> 02:42.336
Yeah?
- Hello,

02:42.379 --> 02:43.815
whoever you are.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.862
Do not tamper
with my enchantment.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.690
- Holy shit,
it's James Earl Jones!

02:48.733 --> 02:51.562
- Shut. Up.

02:51.606 --> 02:55.349
- Yes, you've triggered
a read-me file voicemail.

02:55.392 --> 02:59.440
And no, you may not take me
off speaker phone.

02:59.483 --> 03:02.399
You will not circumvent
or defeat this spell.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.794
Whoever you are, walk away.
Now.

03:05.837 --> 03:09.580
Or your death is as certain
as those I've enchanted.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.759
- So spells are basically
credit cards

03:14.803 --> 03:17.545
with automated
fraud warning calls?

03:17.588 --> 03:20.330
[laughing]
That's not super inspired.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.767
- Well, neither is Henry Fogg.

03:22.811 --> 03:25.509
You are his favorite students,
right?

03:26.423 --> 03:28.077
[chuckling] Sit in the kitchen

03:28.120 --> 03:29.731
until I tell you it's safe.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.559
You stay.

03:35.519 --> 03:36.738
[chuckling]

03:36.781 --> 03:38.479
- She scares me.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.350
- Yeah, well, she's not
the one with the Glock.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.918
- I've got a theory
about you, stud.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.921
- [grunts]
- Stand close.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.707
- Ooh.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.936
- Oh, Henry.
Such a good try.

04:00.979 --> 04:03.373
- [laughing nervously]
What are you doing?

04:03.417 --> 04:05.506
Ow.
- [chuckling]

04:05.549 --> 04:08.030
I'm making you useful.

04:08.073 --> 04:09.640
- Wait.

04:09.684 --> 04:10.989
Where's Janet?

04:13.122 --> 04:14.515
- Hello?

04:14.558 --> 04:15.820
Anyone?

04:15.864 --> 04:18.432
Mother Nature, can you hear me?

04:18.475 --> 04:20.869
Wow, forests don't even talk.

04:20.912 --> 04:24.438
Whole psychotic break
just lacks imagination.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.404
- Again.

04:36.928 --> 04:38.887
- Jesus.
- Dude.

04:38.930 --> 04:39.888
The chips.

04:39.931 --> 04:43.457
- How am I doing this?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.546
[cackling]

04:51.421 --> 04:52.727
- Yes.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.513
This pond better be vodka.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.352
[screams]

05:13.791 --> 05:16.794
[eerie music]

05:16.838 --> 05:23.714
â™ª

05:23.758 --> 05:26.500
[gasping]

05:29.546 --> 05:30.765
- Your Majesty?

05:32.201 --> 05:35.726
- Jesus fuck.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.165
[panting]

05:40.209 --> 05:42.559
- Forgive the suddenness
of my introduction.

05:42.603 --> 05:46.694
I know you're not
quite yourself, King Margo.

05:46.737 --> 05:48.522
- What are you?

05:48.565 --> 05:49.784
Where am I?

05:49.827 --> 05:51.829
And why does everybody
in this nightmare

05:51.873 --> 05:53.135
keep calling me king?

05:53.178 --> 05:55.137
Is that even a thing?

05:55.180 --> 05:57.835
- I'll endeavor to explain.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.881
[bug buzzing]

05:59.924 --> 06:01.099
[buzzing stops]

06:09.543 --> 06:10.892
- Hello.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.068
You're being kind of quiet.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.591
- [sighs]

06:16.114 --> 06:18.203
Look, you're nice and all.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.858
Sort of. But I could use
some intel on this place

06:20.902 --> 06:22.991
but how do I know
you're not a snitch?

06:23.034 --> 06:24.558
- Well, because

06:24.601 --> 06:26.647
like it or not, I'm Santa.

06:26.690 --> 06:29.867
Which used to mean I was once
considered fairly honest.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.609
Reasonably reliable,
but I, I don't know.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.132
Maybe, uh...

06:34.176 --> 06:36.047
slightly admired.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.136
Then all of the sudden
everyone's like, "Hey.

06:38.180 --> 06:41.096
You break into houses once
a year. What's up with that?"

06:41.139 --> 06:43.794
And, uh,
"Kids sit on your lap.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.796
How is that not creepy?"

06:46.623 --> 06:48.016
Congratulations, Earth.

06:48.059 --> 06:50.801
You ruined the name of Santa.

06:50.845 --> 06:54.109
So you don't want
to hear from me?

06:54.152 --> 06:56.111
Good.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.591
'Cause I'm sure you don't need

06:57.634 --> 06:59.157
this thing I could get you.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.985
Called magic.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.032
- How?

07:04.293 --> 07:05.773
[water squelches]

07:05.816 --> 07:09.733
- I am the Lord of All
Fillorian Fresh Water.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.996
Which is a bit pretentious,

07:12.040 --> 07:15.217
so, please, call me Lord Fresh.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.872
- Assuming this
is actually happening,

07:17.915 --> 07:19.569
you pulled me down here.

07:19.613 --> 07:20.744
Why?

07:20.788 --> 07:22.572
- Your birthright box.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.008
- You and my birth box

07:24.052 --> 07:25.140
ain't happening

07:25.183 --> 07:27.055
so back up, "Shape of Water."

07:27.098 --> 07:31.625
- No, no.
Your birthright box.

07:31.668 --> 07:32.887
There.

07:32.930 --> 07:33.888
- Oh.

07:33.931 --> 07:34.889
Right.

07:34.932 --> 07:37.282
- No, Majesty!

07:37.326 --> 07:40.285
If you touch it,
it will harm you.

07:40.329 --> 07:43.158
Even my protective wards
couldn't save you.

07:43.201 --> 07:45.552
- You know about
that spell shit?

07:45.595 --> 07:46.857
I'm really somebody else,

07:46.901 --> 07:48.163
and if I try to figure out who

07:48.206 --> 07:49.251
shit clobbers me, burns me?

07:49.294 --> 07:50.687
- Correct.

07:50.731 --> 07:53.342
Though, as I said,
you're safe down here.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.170
Your birthright box,

07:55.213 --> 07:57.694
which it has been
my honor to guard,

07:57.738 --> 08:00.654
dictated your absence
from the kingdom,

08:00.697 --> 08:03.700
your loss of self,
and your return

08:03.744 --> 08:05.659
this day and hour.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.748
But I must caution.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.880
It also predicted

08:09.924 --> 08:11.926
that you would learn what it is

08:11.969 --> 08:14.798
to live and rule alone.

08:14.842 --> 08:19.281
- Yeah? Well, alone's my jam,
grenouille.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.892
And no matter what, I rule.

08:21.936 --> 08:25.200
[cave rumbling]

08:27.681 --> 08:30.858
- Your enchantment
is most powerful.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.208
I'm not sure that my wards
will hold.

08:33.251 --> 08:35.689
To come back and claim
your destiny,

08:35.732 --> 08:38.953
you must find the god
who summoned you in the dream.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.215
[cave rumbling]

08:40.258 --> 08:42.347
Please accept my apologies.

08:42.391 --> 08:45.916
I'm afraid I can't keep you
as safe as I had hoped.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.962
[cave rumbling]

08:55.056 --> 08:56.927
Walk toward the mountains.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.408
- My destiny is to die
of pneumonia, isn't it?

08:59.451 --> 09:00.670
You can tell me.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.280
- Hardly, Majesty.

09:02.324 --> 09:05.022
Please return
when the spell is lifted.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.763
Here's your lunch.

09:06.807 --> 09:07.764
- Ugh!

09:07.808 --> 09:09.940
[screaming]

09:13.117 --> 09:15.729
[typewriter clacking]

09:15.772 --> 09:17.208
[space warping]

09:18.645 --> 09:20.734
- Well, if he did anything
like my Henry,

09:20.777 --> 09:22.910
he keeps most of his secrets...

09:24.172 --> 09:25.347
in here.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.615
[typewriter clacking]

09:32.659 --> 09:34.922
Todd.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.271
- Oh, my God.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.055
Hansel?

09:38.099 --> 09:40.275
- Hey.
- We gotta hustle.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.756
- Yeah, uh...

09:42.799 --> 09:44.105
anything I can do?

09:44.148 --> 09:45.759
- Yeah. Take your shirt off

09:45.802 --> 09:47.369
and make me a sandwich.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.768
- Sorry, but I'm starved.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.030
If it helps, I'm vegan,

09:56.073 --> 09:57.074
so this sucks for me too.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.293
[sword clanks]

10:03.733 --> 10:06.388
- Todd? Jesus, are you drunk?

10:08.303 --> 10:10.653
[groaning]

10:10.697 --> 10:14.831
[labored breathing]

10:14.875 --> 10:16.746
[groans] Marina.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.792
- Hello, Henry.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.315
- What is this?
What did you do?

10:20.358 --> 10:22.360
- It's the same blue shit
you gave Hansel.

10:22.404 --> 10:25.102
Only I knew you wouldn't
drink it at my request.

10:25.146 --> 10:27.104
So here's the deal.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.149
Give yourself the antidote.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.716
- There is no antidote.

10:29.759 --> 10:30.717
- Bullshit.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.240
- Whoa, hoo, hoo, hoo!

10:32.283 --> 10:34.372
So it's true!

10:35.417 --> 10:37.941
Everything she's been
telling us is true!

10:37.985 --> 10:39.116
- Us?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.727
Who else is involved in this?

10:40.770 --> 10:43.077
- Pretty much all
of your apple-shining,

10:43.120 --> 10:44.426
ass-kissing teacher's pets.

10:44.469 --> 10:45.427
- Christ.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.907
Whatever she's saying she's

10:46.950 --> 10:49.126
going to do to help you,
she isn't.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.867
And how are you talking
about this without--

10:50.911 --> 10:52.695
- Being attacked by the world?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.044
It's magic, remember?

10:54.088 --> 10:55.480
- What timeline are you from?

10:55.524 --> 10:57.395
- The one where you owe me
child support.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.094
I'm kidding.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.878
So the spell takes what,

11:01.922 --> 11:03.924
a day to kick in?

11:03.967 --> 11:05.534
It's almost dawn.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.492
You say there's no antidote.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.451
You better get to a lab
and get to it.

11:09.494 --> 11:12.889
Because I'm not turning you
into a DJ.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.935
No.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.893
You won't like the new you.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.984
Unless you have a secret dream
to live in a moving box.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.247
- [exhales deeply]

11:23.291 --> 11:26.294
- You just hit the rethink
button, okay?

11:29.906 --> 11:30.864
Let's go.

11:30.907 --> 11:31.952
- Bye.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.301
[space warps]

11:33.344 --> 11:34.998
- Jesus.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.827
- Todd.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.743
How long have you been awake?

11:40.787 --> 11:42.353
- We need to get you some help.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.400
- No. And what you just saw
dies with you.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.749
Do you understand?

11:50.753 --> 11:51.145
.

11:51.188 --> 11:55.845
[all yawning, snoring]

11:57.934 --> 11:59.022
- This cannot continue.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.721
- An infinity of pardons,

12:01.764 --> 12:04.071
Acting High King Fen.

12:04.114 --> 12:06.029
There is an urgent matter.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.687
- An urgent poacher?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.167
- Who claims to be
the High King.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.516
- So an urgent, insane poacher.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.039
- Was my first thought.
- Until?

12:16.083 --> 12:18.520
- The name...was uttered.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.189
- So.

12:35.232 --> 12:38.192
You claim to be High King...

12:38.235 --> 12:39.193
Margo?

12:39.236 --> 12:40.281
- No!

12:43.284 --> 12:44.285
[metallic thud]

12:44.328 --> 12:45.808
- Ow!

12:45.852 --> 12:46.853
- There you have it.

12:46.896 --> 12:47.854
- So every time you say--

12:47.897 --> 12:49.333
- [squeaks]

12:49.377 --> 12:51.118
- Weird, huh?

12:51.161 --> 12:53.511
- You look nothing like...her.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.209
- Look.

12:55.252 --> 12:58.865
I'm not saying I'm
who we are not talking about.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.824
But I had this dream where
this goat god, Amber?

13:01.868 --> 13:03.217
both: Ember.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.827
- Whatevs.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.568
Said I had to get here
quick and dirty.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.396
- The reports are true.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.180
Ember has indeed
returned to Fillory.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.747
- Miraculously risen
from the dead.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.141
- Look. If you know
where this Ember is--

13:14.184 --> 13:15.751
- We don't, is the problem.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.668
We don't want to find him.
We have to.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.844
Something's happened
since his return.

13:23.715 --> 13:26.414
- Oh, I'm nodding so you hurry

13:26.457 --> 13:29.852
and you get to something
I actually understand.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.636
- Oh.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.421
Our air

13:33.464 --> 13:35.249
has always been graced

13:35.292 --> 13:37.120
with what you on Earth call

13:37.164 --> 13:38.600
opium.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.428
But now it's saturated.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.560
For some it's tolerable.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.388
Some get quite giddy,

13:44.432 --> 13:47.217
a few succumb to sleep
at the most inconvenient times,

13:47.261 --> 13:49.393
and then there are those who...

13:49.437 --> 13:50.568
- Dance.

13:50.612 --> 13:51.656
In the nude.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.571
- It sounds lighthearted,

13:53.615 --> 13:56.270
but it's actually resulted
in a number of deaths,

13:56.313 --> 13:58.663
mainly in falling asleep
in the wrong place

13:58.707 --> 13:59.926
at the wrong time.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.275
- Trampled in the middle
of the road

14:01.318 --> 14:02.711
being the most common.

14:02.754 --> 14:05.757
Uh, however, a dancer
did die of exposure

14:05.801 --> 14:07.585
on a glacier, though, uh,

14:07.629 --> 14:10.153
by all accounts,
quite gracefully.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.155
- Magic is now rationed.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.896
And none of it is powerful
enough to reverse this.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.464
And since it coincides
with Ember's return...

14:16.507 --> 14:18.945
- His glorious resurrection
and divine rule!

14:18.988 --> 14:21.512
- We hope.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.644
We've come to believe

14:22.687 --> 14:23.906
that this is his doing.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.430
And perhaps if he could be told

14:26.474 --> 14:27.736
of the damage it's causing,

14:27.779 --> 14:30.217
he could be convinced
to reverse this.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.479
- Guys.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.220
I need to stress

14:33.263 --> 14:35.439
how much I don't give a shit.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.832
- Oh.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.399
- But he's dodging you

14:38.442 --> 14:40.488
and he wants me.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.490
So let's find the fucker.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.234
- Sassy.

14:49.279 --> 14:50.280
- Hi.
- Hi!

14:50.324 --> 14:51.325
Kim, sorry, I'm late.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.413
- No, this won't take long.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.849
I think I'm flunking out.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.633
- Oh, first year nerves,
totally normal.

14:55.677 --> 14:56.939
- No, no, no, I am literally
failing everything.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.636
I mean, if I could
just pass one--

14:58.680 --> 14:59.681
- And somebody told you
I have a cheating spell.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.204
- Yes.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.205
- Okay, I will hook you up
right now.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.554
I'm trying not to freak.

15:03.598 --> 15:04.686
- What's wrong?
- I can't tell you.

15:04.729 --> 15:05.948
- Okay.
- I promised.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.689
- Right.
- Dean Fogg is leaving. Shit!

15:07.732 --> 15:08.690
Why did I just say that?

15:08.733 --> 15:10.344
Because it's too much.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.693
Why do I have to be
the only one who knows?

15:11.736 --> 15:13.825
- Wait, he's leaving?
Why?

15:13.869 --> 15:15.653
- Oh, believe me,
it is not his choice.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.525
See, there's this
Hedge Witch, and she--

15:17.568 --> 15:20.223
Dean Fogg, hi!
Sorry I'm late.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.964
I will give you every
cheating spell I have

15:22.008 --> 15:23.400
if you please don't
repeat this, okay?

15:23.444 --> 15:24.967
Great. Thanks.
It's gonna be fine.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.795
Oh, my God,
this is horrible.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.492
So even after you're gone,

15:28.536 --> 15:30.364
nothing about Marina
can go in the memoir?

15:30.407 --> 15:31.713
- Write or breathe
a single word

15:31.756 --> 15:33.497
and there will be blood
on your hands.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.978
But the outstanding business
I'm attending to today

15:36.022 --> 15:38.589
should be recorded
in minute detail.

15:38.633 --> 15:39.721
Walter.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.375
[chuckling] Walter.

15:41.418 --> 15:44.247
You're the best drinking
companion I've ever had.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.640
- Thanks.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.381
I mean, we only drank
together twice.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.513
- I'm a high-functioning
alcoholic, Walter.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.863
We prefer to do
our serious drinking alone.

15:51.907 --> 15:54.388
So that when we weep,
we can wallow in self-loathing

15:54.431 --> 15:55.389
without embarrassment.

15:55.432 --> 15:56.564
Did you get that, Todd?

15:56.607 --> 15:58.305
- Fantastic.
- Excellent.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.524
Walter, in my office bar

16:00.568 --> 16:04.572
is an unopened bottle
of 1977 Hollcroft single malt

16:04.615 --> 16:07.879
that I was going to drink
if I ever committed suicide.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.534
Enjoy, my dear friend.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.449
It's not your fault
I'm always broke, Ashley.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.364
I'm a degenerate gambler
who can use magic

16:14.408 --> 16:15.757
to alter the outcome
of any game.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.541
But then I couldn't relive
the secret shame

16:17.585 --> 16:19.065
I've held since I was
two years old.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.631
What I crave most in the world

16:20.675 --> 16:22.938
is the degradation of losing.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.940
Thank you for every single
moment of that.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.376
- You're $56 short.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.944
- You're a cutthroat bookie.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.598
- Gold.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.817
- Magic has been a brutal
series of disappointments.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.689
And after having
lived 40 timelines,

16:34.732 --> 16:37.431
39 of which range
from the comically horrendous

16:37.474 --> 16:38.867
to the apocalyptically absurd,

16:38.910 --> 16:42.479
to find it was all
for nothing, well...

16:42.523 --> 16:46.701
leaving this life
actually feels liberating.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.356
Hold this, Todd. Thank you.
- Okay.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.444
[blow lands]

16:52.011 --> 16:55.014
- Tell Jennifer thank you
and goodbye.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.452
I had an affair with his wife.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.497
He behaved abominably.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.847
Do you find all this
as cathartic as I do, Todd?

17:02.891 --> 17:04.588
- I think you really hurt him.

17:04.632 --> 17:05.981
- Well, back to my childhood.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.722
I was raised by my grandmother,

17:07.765 --> 17:09.593
the kindest, wisest person
I've ever known.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.030
Of course I could never
tell her that

17:11.073 --> 17:13.597
because all forms
of intimacy horrify me.

17:14.555 --> 17:18.646
"All forms of intimacy
terrify the hell out of me."

17:18.689 --> 17:19.821
[chuckling]

17:19.864 --> 17:21.779
[knocking on door]
Yes?

17:25.957 --> 17:28.873
Kim. What can I do for you?

17:28.917 --> 17:31.528
- Look, I'm pretty sure
I shouldn't tell you this.

17:31.572 --> 17:34.488
- Well, you probably shouldn't
have walked in and said that.

17:34.531 --> 17:37.099
- [sighs] I don't think
that I belong here.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.841
- As I said,
it would take some time.

17:39.884 --> 17:43.062
And, I promise, you do.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.151
- Right, and you're literally
the only one

17:45.194 --> 17:47.370
that thinks that,
and you're leaving.

17:48.632 --> 17:49.720
- Todd.

17:51.679 --> 17:52.071
.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.550
- Look, it's not his fault.

17:54.421 --> 17:54.551
He's just upset.
I am too.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.553
Anybody that knew would be.

17:56.597 --> 17:57.946
- Please.

18:03.473 --> 18:07.347
[sighs] I probably owe you
an explanation.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.697
My life is mostly made up
of regrets.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.134
I'm not looking
for contradiction or pity.

18:12.178 --> 18:15.181
It's just a fact
I'm suddenly forced to face.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.183
But of all my many regrets

18:17.226 --> 18:19.402
the greatest is something
I did very recently

18:19.446 --> 18:21.578
to some of the most maddeningly
millennial students

18:21.622 --> 18:22.971
I ever had.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.110
- What--

18:31.153 --> 18:32.546
Were they gonna hit us?

18:32.589 --> 18:36.071
- Advantage of being
the spell caster.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.118
I'll never be able to correct
what I did to them.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.467
But Kim,

18:40.510 --> 18:41.511
one day you might.

18:41.555 --> 18:42.512
- Me?

18:42.556 --> 18:44.471
- You have no idea

18:44.514 --> 18:46.299
what you're capable of.

18:46.342 --> 18:47.648
I do.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.433
- Okay, then if you want me
to help these students

18:50.477 --> 18:52.261
can you tell me who they are?

18:54.045 --> 18:56.787
- Their lives
were in grave danger.

18:56.831 --> 18:59.268
I cast a spell that erased
their identities

18:59.312 --> 19:00.704
and gave them new ones,

19:00.748 --> 19:04.186
and now that same spell
has been cast on me.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.232
- [exhales] Jesus.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.017
I mean, isn't there
anything you can do?

19:09.060 --> 19:11.585
- Well, if I reveal that
the spell can be reversed,

19:11.628 --> 19:14.588
then someone would reverse
the spell on my students,

19:14.631 --> 19:16.590
ensuring their deaths.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.419
I will not allow
that to happen.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.203
I have to do this.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.379
I must accept this.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.737
[door closes]

19:33.781 --> 19:36.827
[melancholy music]

19:36.871 --> 19:44.095
â™ª

19:46.272 --> 19:47.360
[fabric tears]

19:49.536 --> 19:51.712
- Ah, stubborn dude.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.063
You got Plan B?

19:55.106 --> 19:56.586
- B plans are for losers.

19:56.630 --> 19:57.587
- Okay.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.110
Uh, well, whatever happens,

19:59.154 --> 20:00.242
thank you for trying.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.246
I don't really know why

20:04.290 --> 20:08.076
you're putting yourself out
so much for us, but...

20:08.119 --> 20:09.817
it's pretty cool.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.732
- Well, it's pretty
common knowledge

20:11.775 --> 20:13.690
that I'm a very,
very good person

20:13.734 --> 20:15.518
who lives to help others.

20:15.562 --> 20:18.173
- [chuckles]

20:18.217 --> 20:19.609
- Mm.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.308
[coughing]
Oh.

20:23.657 --> 20:26.137
- It's such a piece of shit.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.531
- Hey. I like the artwork.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.359
- Yep. Sure.

20:30.403 --> 20:33.406
- You have to admit,
the characters? Us?

20:33.449 --> 20:34.755
We're pretty complex.

20:34.798 --> 20:37.236
- Oh, yeah, real complex.

20:37.279 --> 20:40.456
Yeah, Isaac's big problem
is his dick is too big.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.806
- Hey. It can be a problem.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.112
Seriously.

20:44.155 --> 20:45.156
It narrows the field

20:45.200 --> 20:47.376
by a lot more than you think.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.725
I've been on way
too many first dates

20:48.769 --> 20:50.553
that end in urgent care, so...

20:50.597 --> 20:51.859
- Gross.
- Look.

20:51.902 --> 20:56.385
My life is pretty cool, so...

20:56.429 --> 20:58.344
how do I know this other me

20:58.387 --> 20:59.432
is gonna...

20:59.475 --> 21:00.781
- Nail as many groupies?

21:00.824 --> 21:03.262
- Whoa, hey, whoa, no.

21:03.305 --> 21:07.353
That is not what Hansel
is about, okay?

21:07.396 --> 21:09.529
- You know there's a chance
the real you

21:09.572 --> 21:11.357
didn't bang your sister?

21:11.400 --> 21:12.749
- Hey, no, that's--

21:12.793 --> 21:15.274
she was my step sister, okay?

21:15.317 --> 21:16.623
Step sister.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.451
And we didn't know
till, till later.

21:18.494 --> 21:19.756
- Mm.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.280
- Too many stepdads.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.803
- All right, well,
what about you?

21:22.846 --> 21:24.370
What's your kink?

21:24.413 --> 21:25.849
- Me? [scoffs]

21:25.893 --> 21:27.547
No, see, I'm perfect.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.810
Yeah, I catch drug dealers,
murderers,

21:29.853 --> 21:31.725
arsonists, blackmailers, pimps.

21:31.768 --> 21:33.596
I even stopped a girl
from giving herself

21:33.640 --> 21:35.555
a coat-hanger abortion and
got her to Planned Parenthood.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.296
You see, I...

21:37.339 --> 21:38.427
I'm a hero.

21:38.471 --> 21:39.689
- So why would you
give that up?

21:39.733 --> 21:41.212
You sound awesome.

21:41.256 --> 21:44.215
- I sound fake.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.653
Which I am.

21:46.696 --> 21:47.741
- Oh, like your thunder meat.

21:47.784 --> 21:49.569
- All right, easy.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.223
It's...it's a meat.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.791
I don't know if it's thunder.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.273
- We just never know
where his celestial,

21:58.317 --> 22:00.797
newly-risen godliness
is going to pop up next.

22:00.841 --> 22:02.843
From the brothel
in the Lower Meerskin,

22:02.886 --> 22:04.540
Ember was then sighted
on the schooner

22:04.584 --> 22:06.977
of the thin white duke
off Basher Island,

22:07.021 --> 22:09.415
where there was a celebration
for three days and nights.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.416
- Okay.

22:10.459 --> 22:11.939
Well, so far, every sighting

22:11.982 --> 22:13.288
he either gets
the party started

22:13.332 --> 22:14.594
or he dives right into one

22:14.637 --> 22:16.204
that's already jumping off.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.727
- Ember has always
enjoyed his pleasures,

22:17.771 --> 22:20.687
but this pace reeks
of self-destruction.

22:20.730 --> 22:21.775
- Please.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.342
One July 4th,

22:23.385 --> 22:25.822
I bet I could snort
my bodyweight in coke.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.389
This dude's an amateur.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.695
Next.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.959
- Landfall at
Shimmering Cliff Palace,

22:32.002 --> 22:34.875
then an...orgy

22:34.918 --> 22:36.920
at Sacred Sky Nunnery.

22:36.964 --> 22:39.662
- Okay. That's almost
impressive.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.231
So look, he's headed east.

22:43.274 --> 22:46.452
If he keeps going,
what's the next hotspot?

22:46.495 --> 22:47.670
- The Hare on the Ass.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.368
- Seriously?

22:53.459 --> 22:54.590
Whimsy.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.723
I fucking hate it.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.335
- So you found a whole
family of them, huh?

23:00.379 --> 23:01.858
Mm.

23:01.902 --> 23:04.383
What happened
to the mother pig?

23:06.428 --> 23:08.952
[pig snorting]

23:08.996 --> 23:10.693
Kill it.
[pig squeals]

23:10.737 --> 23:11.694
- What?

23:11.738 --> 23:12.869
- Enyalius won't come

23:12.913 --> 23:15.394
without a sacrifice, silly.

23:15.437 --> 23:16.612
Here.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.701
Slit its belly open, please.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.529
Entrails on the altar.

23:20.573 --> 23:21.878
[pig snorting]

23:21.922 --> 23:24.794
- No, I'm not, I'm not--

23:24.838 --> 23:26.840
Look, I'm a person with a job

23:26.883 --> 23:28.537
and a girlfriend and a life,

23:28.581 --> 23:32.280
and I'm not your, your pal.
Or your playmate.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.413
And I'm not scared of you
anymore.

23:34.456 --> 23:37.894
So why don't you
just fucking kill me?

23:37.938 --> 23:39.766
- I would never do that.

23:41.028 --> 23:42.029
[bone snaps]

23:42.072 --> 23:43.944
- Ah!

23:43.987 --> 23:45.946
[screaming]

23:51.517 --> 23:53.344
- [chuckling]

23:53.388 --> 23:55.390
Hello, Etta.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.480
[both chuckling]

23:58.524 --> 24:00.830
- Oh, I suppose this is why
you summoned me.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.574
- Thank you.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.446
- Oh, and the answer is no.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.317
Your new suit
is not finished yet.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.101
- Oh, pity.

24:11.145 --> 24:13.669
- You are usually
not this impatient.

24:13.713 --> 24:16.933
Henry, would you like to see
the work in progress?

24:16.977 --> 24:17.934
- Oh, yes.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.588
- [chuckles] Okay.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.464
- Ah.

24:25.507 --> 24:26.726
Beautiful.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.858
Of course.
[chuckles]

24:30.991 --> 24:33.036
Damn it.
- What in the world?

24:33.080 --> 24:34.690
- Magic ration.

24:34.734 --> 24:37.519
My office had some
unexpected visitors today

24:37.563 --> 24:39.608
who took a huge portion
of today's magic.

24:39.652 --> 24:42.350
- Ah.
No worries.

24:44.352 --> 24:45.788
Smell.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.444
- [sniffs]

24:49.488 --> 24:53.579
[crying]

24:53.622 --> 24:55.406
I'm sorry.

24:55.450 --> 24:58.453
That's my grandmother's
huckleberry pie.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.107
- Wait, what?

25:00.150 --> 25:01.848
What is it, Henry?

25:05.895 --> 25:08.028
So why a comic book?

25:08.071 --> 25:10.509
- Graphic novel, Etta.

25:10.552 --> 25:14.513
Had a lot of characters
with detailed backstories.

25:14.556 --> 25:15.775
And I could look at them.

25:15.818 --> 25:18.995
So the glamour was
much easier to cast.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.128
Doesn't matter now.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.522
I'm about to live
a version of it.

25:23.565 --> 25:26.437
Though, I'm assured,
one not quite as nice.

25:26.481 --> 25:29.658
- Well, you seem
awfully sanguine.

25:29.702 --> 25:32.531
- Fate's a fucker
that always wins.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.837
- Okay, I've known you for 22--

25:34.881 --> 25:38.580
well...23 years now.

25:38.624 --> 25:41.757
And I've loved you dearly
every moment.

25:41.801 --> 25:45.195
Fully aware that you can barely
stand yourself.

25:45.239 --> 25:48.503
And that made me sad, but...

25:48.547 --> 25:51.593
it also made you
my best customer. [chuckles]

25:51.637 --> 25:53.073
- How so?

25:54.117 --> 25:56.163
- Isn't it obvious?

25:56.206 --> 25:58.034
Come on, the bespoke suits,

25:58.078 --> 26:00.471
the hand-sewn shirts...

26:00.515 --> 26:03.039
[sighs]

26:03.083 --> 26:05.085
It's armor.

26:05.128 --> 26:08.131
It's an armor
to keep the world away.

26:08.175 --> 26:10.612
A disguise so that nobody

26:10.656 --> 26:13.615
can see what a truly
loving heart you have.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.444
- [chuckles]

26:17.488 --> 26:20.753
[crickets chirping]

26:25.975 --> 26:28.587
- You said if revealed
the spell can be reversed.

26:28.630 --> 26:29.588
- Kim.

26:29.631 --> 26:30.937
Don't.

26:30.980 --> 26:34.984
[building rumbling]

26:35.028 --> 26:36.899
- I'm one of them, aren't I?

26:39.859 --> 26:42.557
You have to undo this
on all of us.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.645
- And then what?

26:43.689 --> 26:44.907
- And then we fight.

26:44.951 --> 26:46.692
- I know I can't stop you.

26:46.735 --> 26:50.217
But please, be more careful now

26:50.260 --> 26:52.654
than you've ever been
in your life.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.830
Well, lives.

27:03.056 --> 27:05.536
Finally getting to be
your teacher...

27:05.580 --> 27:07.103
[chuckles softly]

27:09.497 --> 27:11.499
Has been an honor.

27:11.542 --> 27:14.284
[somber music]

27:14.328 --> 27:21.552
â™ª

27:31.824 --> 27:35.218
[distant car horns]

27:41.790 --> 27:44.880
- You're now the saddest loser
I ever buried.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.142
Look.

27:56.936 --> 27:58.111
- Marina.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.853
- Hi, Dad.

28:16.129 --> 28:16.346
.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.435
[screw clatters]

28:19.132 --> 28:19.567
- How's it going?

28:23.745 --> 28:25.573
- Got it.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.188
- Do you feel it?

28:34.582 --> 28:36.279
- Stronger further up.

28:36.323 --> 28:38.586
- My arm wouldn't even
fit in there.

28:39.587 --> 28:42.068
- [straining]

28:48.248 --> 28:49.771
- Go, little buddy.
Come on.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.124
Come on, little buddy.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.444
[gasps]

29:15.579 --> 29:18.452
[footsteps echo]

29:19.627 --> 29:21.107
- Hey. Hey, come on now.

29:21.150 --> 29:22.108
Little narration.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.849
- Fuck off.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.676
Come on, little buddy.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.308
[panting]

29:51.659 --> 29:54.488
[phone ringing]

29:54.531 --> 29:55.881
- Yes?

29:59.232 --> 30:00.799
I realize that.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.801
But these dossiers are private.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.327
- [chuckling] Holy shit.

30:09.416 --> 30:10.765
[hangs up phone]

30:14.290 --> 30:17.380
[thudding footsteps]

30:17.424 --> 30:18.381
[squish]

30:18.425 --> 30:19.687
[gasps]

30:21.863 --> 30:23.473
Sorry, little buddy.

30:23.517 --> 30:24.779
- What happened?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.433
What?

30:26.476 --> 30:27.826
Did, did anyone ever tell you

30:27.869 --> 30:30.219
you're kind of withholding,
you know?

30:30.263 --> 30:31.742
Oh, come on.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.570
You're not trying to
kill yourself again, are you?

30:33.614 --> 30:34.876
- No.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.839
Hey, is all of that chimney
stuff about you true?

30:40.882 --> 30:43.276
- Never met one
I couldn't crack.

30:46.192 --> 30:48.585
[pig grunting]

30:48.629 --> 30:51.501
- Leg next?
- No, no, no, no, no.

30:51.545 --> 30:54.243
Okay, I'm ready.
Whatever you want, okay?

30:54.287 --> 30:56.419
[pig squealing]

30:56.463 --> 30:58.247
Ah.

30:58.291 --> 30:59.683
[bone snaps]

30:59.727 --> 31:00.902
Oh.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.906
- Time to die.
Yes it is.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.865
Give me a little goodbye kiss.

31:06.908 --> 31:08.344
Yes.

31:12.609 --> 31:15.743
- Explains a lot
of weird shit, but...

31:15.786 --> 31:19.703
I promised I'd keep everything
about him private.

31:19.747 --> 31:23.882
- Okay. Yeah, and I'm trying
to save him.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.579
So please.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.714
How was that?
Was it good?

31:30.758 --> 31:32.020
- Yeah.
- Can I have one?

31:32.064 --> 31:34.675
- Oh, yes.
Of course.

31:34.718 --> 31:36.372
- Thank you.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.896
[magic shorting out]

31:40.463 --> 31:44.467
- Magic's supposed to
stay on till 11:00.

31:44.511 --> 31:46.643
- Spells take magic, right?

31:46.687 --> 31:48.994
Which is rationed.
- Which sucks.

31:49.037 --> 31:51.648
- And a spell like this would
take even more power

31:51.692 --> 31:53.041
than a normal one, right?

31:53.085 --> 31:56.262
I mean, six, seven,
eight people?

31:56.305 --> 31:58.264
Plus whole lives?

31:58.307 --> 32:01.484
- No. If you had any
interruption in the flow...

32:01.528 --> 32:03.965
[glass shatters]

32:04.009 --> 32:06.054
Wait. Magic's off.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.055
- It's him.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.535
It's the spell.

32:08.578 --> 32:09.840
He told me that it would
try and kill us.

32:09.884 --> 32:12.060
- Right, but without magic,
how...

32:12.104 --> 32:13.583
Shit.

32:13.627 --> 32:14.976
Maybe he actually finished it.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.543
- Finished what?

32:16.586 --> 32:19.546
- This thing he worked on
for years.

32:19.589 --> 32:21.765
A perpetual battery.

32:23.985 --> 32:24.986
- Come on.

32:28.642 --> 32:30.383
- Pray a little harder, please.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.391
- Is that suckling I smell?

32:39.305 --> 32:40.784
- Enyalius?

32:40.828 --> 32:42.612
- Well, fuck yeah it is.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.310
- You know what's funny?

32:44.353 --> 32:45.876
He sacrificed the pig.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.400
He prayed.

32:47.443 --> 32:48.967
And he's never heard of you.

32:50.664 --> 32:53.449
- [grunting]

32:53.493 --> 32:56.800
[groaning, laughs]

32:56.844 --> 32:58.846
How dare you?

32:58.889 --> 33:01.718
[grunting, growling]

33:01.762 --> 33:05.461
[panting]

33:05.505 --> 33:08.551
- I want it back.

33:08.595 --> 33:10.075
Give it to me.

33:10.118 --> 33:13.861
- Well, I have no idea
what "it" is

33:13.904 --> 33:15.384
but I grant you permission

33:15.428 --> 33:17.996
to search my ball sack
with your tongue.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.520
- Fine.

33:20.563 --> 33:23.044
I'll just take it.

33:23.088 --> 33:26.004
- [screaming]

[organs squelching]

33:51.638 --> 33:54.510
[mysterious pulsating]

34:02.475 --> 34:04.607
- Okay, so.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.957
Remember, Fogg said be
really, really careful.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.133
Because--

34:08.176 --> 34:09.482
[energy bursts]
-[cries out]

34:09.525 --> 34:11.440
[thud]

34:11.484 --> 34:12.441
- Oh, my God.

34:12.485 --> 34:13.442
Kim?

34:13.486 --> 34:14.530
Kim.

34:16.663 --> 34:17.881
No, no.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.840
No, no, no.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.713
Yeah, I need a medic.

34:23.757 --> 34:24.801
Yeah, I think she's--

34:24.845 --> 34:26.586
- [gasps]

34:27.717 --> 34:30.416
- Sorry, prank.

34:31.982 --> 34:34.463
Kim. Are you okay?

34:35.812 --> 34:37.727
- Fine.

34:37.771 --> 34:39.773
- No, see.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.775
You kind of...

34:41.818 --> 34:42.906
died.

34:45.518 --> 34:45.735
.

34:45.779 --> 34:48.434
- Well, maybe being un-killable
is my discipline.

34:49.304 --> 34:51.306
- Yeah, that's not a thing.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.963
- Hey.

34:56.006 --> 34:58.096
How much juice do you think
this thing has?

34:58.139 --> 35:00.576
- Well, it's perpetual.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.578
- So...

35:02.622 --> 35:04.363
it can be overloaded.

35:04.406 --> 35:07.061
- I have no idea.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.236
[energy bursts]

35:08.280 --> 35:10.108
Oh, shit!

35:10.151 --> 35:12.022
How is this a good idea?

35:16.288 --> 35:18.725
- [gasps]

35:18.768 --> 35:21.336
[breathing hard]

35:31.259 --> 35:32.260
- Oh, God.

35:32.304 --> 35:33.261
- [groaning]

35:33.305 --> 35:35.133
- It's not in there!

35:37.526 --> 35:41.139
You're not Enyalius, are you?

35:41.182 --> 35:44.011
You're his servant.

35:44.054 --> 35:47.362
A corybant.
Aren't you?

35:47.406 --> 35:50.148
- All right, look, he's,
he's not who you want.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.366
So just...

35:51.410 --> 35:53.063
You know, let him go.

35:53.107 --> 35:55.283
All right?

35:55.327 --> 35:57.024
- [groaning]

35:57.067 --> 36:00.027
- Why did your master
send you to trick me?

36:00.070 --> 36:02.072
- He knows.

36:06.468 --> 36:09.471
[horns, drums playing]

36:09.515 --> 36:16.522
â™ª

36:27.228 --> 36:28.664
- It's not even mid-day.

36:28.708 --> 36:31.101
- Real ragers rave in the day.

36:36.803 --> 36:39.414
Horn guy.
Is that him?

36:48.467 --> 36:49.729
- Who is that?

36:49.772 --> 36:51.209
- An imposter.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.210
No wonder he won't see

36:52.253 --> 36:53.298
anyone who knows him.

36:53.341 --> 36:54.734
- Hey. Ember.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.217
I'm here.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.219
- Yeah, you are.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.829
Congrats.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.703

[body thuds]

38:37.489 --> 38:39.360
Oh.

38:39.404 --> 38:42.276
You wanted to play.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.452
Sorry. He's too dead.

38:47.499 --> 38:47.890
.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.110
- Cool trick. Do it again.

38:50.153 --> 38:53.156
[indistinct murmuring]

39:10.304 --> 39:12.045
[all gasping softly]

39:16.136 --> 39:18.399
- Okay, what the what now?

39:18.443 --> 39:21.881
- What the fuck are you
doing here, Bacchus?

39:21.924 --> 39:23.622
- [laughing] All right.

39:23.665 --> 39:25.101
Have we banged?

39:25.145 --> 39:26.973
- I followed you on Instagram.

39:27.016 --> 39:28.975
Everybody did
till they kicked you off.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.238
- Oh, I know, right? Dicks.

39:31.281 --> 39:32.631
- Well.

39:32.674 --> 39:34.502
That explains all the opium
in the air.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.156
Nice touch, I like it.

39:36.199 --> 39:37.287
- It's pretty sweet, right?

39:37.331 --> 39:38.288
- Mm-hmm, all right, all right.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.899
What are you doing here?

39:39.942 --> 39:41.422
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

39:41.466 --> 39:44.860
- Hey, so, you really want
to go back to Earth, right?

39:44.904 --> 39:47.036
- No, I want you to answer
my fucking question.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.124
- Thanks for popping in.

39:48.168 --> 39:51.171
[all gasping]

39:51.214 --> 39:52.433
- Where is our High King?

39:52.477 --> 39:54.261
- Who are you?

39:54.304 --> 39:55.654
- A god

39:55.697 --> 39:58.396
is all you need to know.

40:05.098 --> 40:07.143
- I'm glad you're back,
Quentin.

40:08.362 --> 40:11.409
I was getting a little tired
of the Brian game.

40:12.932 --> 40:15.413
- Yeah, me too.

40:20.418 --> 40:25.379
So maybe I missed something
when we were playing, but...

40:25.423 --> 40:29.557
you had to torture him
to death.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.518
Why, again?

40:33.561 --> 40:37.173
- Gods are so tricky.

40:37.217 --> 40:38.697
- Right.

40:38.740 --> 40:42.962
But what about the one
that you were after today?

40:43.005 --> 40:45.486
- Oh, we'll get him.

40:45.530 --> 40:48.054
And I'll get back
what he took from me.

40:48.097 --> 40:49.621
And then the others.

40:49.664 --> 40:51.013
They all took.

40:51.057 --> 40:53.407
- Took what, exactly?

40:53.451 --> 40:55.540
- See, that's what I
don't really know.

40:55.583 --> 40:58.934
They took this part of me

40:58.978 --> 41:01.459
that knew things.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.592
It's not fair.

41:04.636 --> 41:06.594
- No, yeah, totally.

41:07.595 --> 41:09.292
They owe you.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.295
Got it.

41:14.210 --> 41:17.039
- You really understand me,
Quentin.

41:19.128 --> 41:21.435
It's good to have a friend
like you.

41:26.266 --> 41:27.963
- You know,
speaking of friends,

41:28.007 --> 41:30.270
when you get back

41:30.313 --> 41:32.446
what the gods took from you...

41:34.666 --> 41:37.103
maybe...

41:37.146 --> 41:40.236
could I maybe have Eliot back?

41:42.282 --> 41:44.240
- The one who tried to kill me?

41:44.284 --> 41:47.026
- Hey, hey, no. No.
That was a mistake.

41:47.069 --> 41:49.507
- You were there.
You...

41:51.334 --> 41:53.598
like him more than me?

41:53.641 --> 41:55.730
- No, I, I didn't say that.

41:55.774 --> 41:58.080
- You miss him.

41:58.124 --> 42:01.475
You...you miss
all your friends.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.739
The...the ones in my castle

42:04.783 --> 42:06.262
who tried to kill me.

42:11.790 --> 42:13.139
Good.

42:13.182 --> 42:16.534
[leaves rustling]

42:16.577 --> 42:17.796
[fly zips]

42:17.839 --> 42:19.101
- Huh.

42:19.145 --> 42:22.322
Well, upsides and downsides.

42:22.365 --> 42:24.019
- Yeah, no,
I remember everything.

42:24.063 --> 42:26.108
Kind of like a dream.

42:26.152 --> 42:28.720
- I was gonna say
acid trip myself.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.250
Oh, my God.

42:39.208 --> 42:40.688
- Mis hermanos.

42:40.732 --> 42:43.125
- Where were you?
We looked everywhere.

42:43.169 --> 42:44.779
- Stay back.
- Why?

42:49.479 --> 42:52.395
- Because I'm not here to play.
