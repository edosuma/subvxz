Did he call you?

00:31.320 --> 00:32.320
No.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.320
Last I heard
he was.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.360
Maybe he's
grounded again.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.800
Or maybe chickened out
on coming alone.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.800

00:54.760 --> 00:55.960
Cute.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.480
Cool. We're gonna hear
a story about trains.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.960
Oh, yeah, but...

<i> [Train sounds

01:02.920 --> 01:07.240
My story's also about
wanting something really bad,

01:07.240 --> 01:10.240
so bad it's all
you think about.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.760
Nothing else matters.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.240
But when you're finally
getting close to it,

01:14.240 --> 01:17.240
where you can see the light
at the end of the tunnel,

01:17.240 --> 01:19.360
you've gotta watch out.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.400
Because that light could be
on the front of a big old train

01:23.400 --> 01:25.400
barreling
straight at you.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.040

any place to run.

go tomorrow.

stupid in it!

02:52.200 --> 02:54.240
Because he was
a real conductor,

real soon.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.160
You like the watch?

04:00.160 --> 04:02.600
Every conductor
should have a watch.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.120
It's a real beaut,
isn't it?

04:05.120 --> 04:06.600
Here... take it.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.800
Then you can be
a real conductor,

than that.

That's the name of

11:35.840 --> 11:38.920
Who is he? Do you know him?

11:38.920 --> 11:40.760
I know of him.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.040
In the old days

11:44.040 --> 11:45.400
before radios,

11:45.400 --> 11:48.240
do you know how conductors
got their messages?

11:48.240 --> 11:49.000
No.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.920
Station operators left them
on poles beside the tracks,

11:52.920 --> 11:56.440
and conductors had to reach
out a hand and grab it

11:56.440 --> 11:57.920
as the train went by.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.520
Pretty ancient.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.040
Ha ha ha ha.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.160
I suppose so.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.440
Anyway, there's a story
I always heard

12:04.440 --> 12:06.320
from the old-timers

12:06.320 --> 12:09.400
about a night they were
working on the tracks

12:09.400 --> 12:10.920
not so far from here.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.920
So they sent out a message
to the conductor on the 713

12:13.920 --> 12:15.520
to change tracks.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.040
See, that's hard work
back then.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.080
The train had to stop.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.360
The conductor got out and
changed the switch himself.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.360
Anyway, this conductor

12:25.360 --> 12:30.320
got sent a message to
change over at switch 224.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.040
What happened?

12:35.280 --> 12:37.360
Forgot to
check his watch.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.360
Fell asleep.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.320
He never got
the message.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.760
Never changed
the switch.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.880
Train crashed.

12:46.880 --> 12:50.480
A lot of folks died,
including the conductor.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.640
Ray Lawson.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.760
But I saw him.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.680
When they dug his body
outta the wreck,

12:57.680 --> 13:00.720
he still had the watch
in his hand.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.920
Lid wasn't even open.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.040
Cap, that switch
224--

13:05.040 --> 13:06.920
that's on the tracks
by my house!

13:06.920 --> 13:09.920

my house, didn't it?

14:25.280 --> 14:27.280
Don't matter who I am.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.400
Leave the boy alone!

14:29.400 --> 14:32.760
Get on your
ghost train and go.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.560
Can't do that.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.200
[Train whistle blows]

14:46.840 --> 14:49.480
I've gotta keep
the schedule.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.360
I told you
to leave the boy a--

15:00.360 --> 15:02.080
Time to board, Cap.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.040
I don't need
any more passengers,

15:04.040 --> 15:07.160
but you can help bring
me a new conductor.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.360
Ha ha ha ha ha!

15:12.360 --> 15:13.280
All aboard!

Ha ha ha ha!

15:16.400 --> 15:17.680
Cap! No!

15:19.080 --> 15:20.800
Don't do it!

15:43.840 --> 15:45.760
<i> Zebo's just in.</i>

15:45.760 --> 15:47.480
Let's play.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.240
Hey, yo!

15:56.240 --> 15:59.760
You're gettin' real close
to the deep end there, bro.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.280
Cap.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.760
What about him?

16:02.760 --> 16:04.160
Look.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.080
Yeah. Cute.
So what?

16:07.080 --> 16:10.400
Look! That's him!
He's in the train!

16:10.400 --> 16:13.040
[Laughs]
Hey, you're right.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.760
Funny, last time
I saw him,

16:14.760 --> 16:16.240
he was a little
bigger.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.320
Hey, Cap, still hanging with
my screwy little brother?

16:20.520 --> 16:21.960
This isn't a joke!

16:21.960 --> 16:25.520
Yeah, the only joke
here is you, you little--

16:29.080 --> 16:30.520
How'd you do that?

16:30.520 --> 16:32.240
I didn't.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.440
Well, who did?

16:38.320 --> 16:40.360
Train magic.

[Clock tolls]

16:50.000 --> 16:51.560
7:13!

The 713 just left
the station!

16:55.080 --> 16:56.720
W-what's goin' on?

16:56.720 --> 16:59.200
Hank, I know
you think I'm crazy,

16:59.200 --> 17:02.120
and maybe I am,
but you gotta help me!

17:02.120 --> 17:04.520
Forget it. You're
beyond help, lame wad.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.200
I mean it! If we
don't, Cap is gonna die,

17:07.200 --> 17:09.560
and who knows what'll
happen to me?

17:09.560 --> 17:10.920
Would you listen
to yourself?

17:10.920 --> 17:12.640
You're cracking up!

17:12.640 --> 17:15.200
You gotta get out of
this basement.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.280
Dad is gone, Tim. This
isn't gonna bring him back.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.319
[Sighs]

17:20.319 --> 17:23.200
Look, I'm just
worried about you.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.160
If you're really
worried about me,

17:28.160 --> 17:29.600
you'd help me.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.960
You're serious.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.760
Please, Hank?

17:41.200 --> 17:44.320
All right, Timmy. What
do you want me to do?

18:01.240 --> 18:02.160
[Sighs]

18:02.160 --> 18:04.160
I don't know
who's crazier,

18:04.160 --> 18:05.640
him or me.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.560
Hasn't been a train
here in 50 years.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.680
I'm telling Mom.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.680
We gotta put him away.

18:21.680 --> 18:24.400
He needs professional help.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.840
Cap!

18:52.840 --> 18:54.960
Cap, where are you?

18:54.960 --> 18:56.960
'Bout time
you came back.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.840
I'm getting fed up
with playing solitaire.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.960
He has his ticket this time,
I assume.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.240
Cap!

19:06.240 --> 19:09.040
Well, of course
he has his ticket.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.040
Cap.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.200
Cap!

19:11.200 --> 19:14.040
Wake up. Come on!

[Train whistle]

19:22.520 --> 19:24.120
No way.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.800

Holy--

19:47.200 --> 19:48.480
Come on!

19:48.480 --> 19:51.640
You didn't think I'd make
the same mistake twice.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.640
Out of my way.
Sit down.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.640
He doesn't have
a ticket!

19:55.640 --> 19:57.640
He doesn't
need a ticket.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.880
Well, I won't be
needing that anymore.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.040
You love trains,

20:03.040 --> 20:04.640
don't ya?

20:04.640 --> 20:08.120
Well, now you're gonna
get one all your own.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.760
Just a few more seconds.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.640
713 crashed
80 years ago,

20:13.640 --> 20:16.640
and it's been doing
it ever since...

20:16.640 --> 20:18.720
Right on time.

It doesn't matter,

I'll be gone.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.680
Here you are, my boy.

20:41.680 --> 20:45.000
Train's gotta have
a conductor.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.440
And a conductor's
gotta have...

20:47.440 --> 20:49.560
A watch.

It's train magic,
Timothy,

21:20.480 --> 21:23.160
the most powerful
kind.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.000
Ray Lawson!

21:33.400 --> 21:35.760
This is not my train!

21:39.360 --> 21:41.840
And we're getting off.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.760
What are you doing?

No!

[Train whistle

Hey!

22:06.120 --> 22:07.560
What was that?

22:07.560 --> 22:10.560
The 713! You switched it
to track 2

22:10.560 --> 22:13.560
like the conductor was
supposed to 80 years ago!

22:13.560 --> 22:14.560
What conductor?

22:14.560 --> 22:15.800
That one.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.120
Cap: He doesn't have
a train anymore,

22:25.120 --> 22:27.680
and he has no watch.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.480
He has nothing but
these old tracks

22:30.480 --> 22:31.880
and the night.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.640
Train magic.

gettin' on home.

Cap? I don't think
I'm gonna be

22:45.480 --> 22:48.480
coming around to the
station for a while.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.480
That's good,
Timothy.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.000
Maybe I'll stop by

22:52.000 --> 22:54.720
and watch you play
some baseball.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.680
What just happened
here?

23:04.560 --> 23:08.080
I think I just got rid
of a couple of ghosts.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.000
So Tim learned about
2 kinds of magic:

23:23.000 --> 23:24.960
Train magic...

23:24.960 --> 23:27.960
And the kind of magic
that happens

23:27.960 --> 23:29.440
between brothers...

23:29.440 --> 23:31.400
And friends.
