<i>Close combat</i>

AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

00:38.163 --> 00:43.085
<i>Running away but not forever</i>
<i>Chewing and swallowing reality</i>

00:43.168 --> 00:47.214

00:47.631 --> 00:51.009
<i>Though you know the danger of the dark</i>

00:51.093 --> 00:53.929
<i>A type of system that is too cold</i>

00:54.012 --> 00:57.182

<i>Which one is it now?</i>

00:58.350 --> 01:02.521

<i>Over and over</i>

01:02.604 --> 01:08.068

<i>I am I</i>

01:15.158 --> 01:16.410
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:16.493 --> 01:19.246
<i>Started with nothing but risk</i>
<i>From the beginning</i>

01:19.329 --> 01:21.832
<i>Give it all you got</i>
<i>Craze</i>

<i>So I slashed</i>

01:29.339 --> 01:31.842
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:46.398 --> 01:50.402
MUST BE TOUGH BEING A LAPDOG

02:07.336 --> 02:09.379
Yoko Tainaka, right?

02:15.719 --> 02:17.804
Your stepfather was Satoshi Tainaka.

02:17.888 --> 02:21.183
Your real father died in an accident
when you were 15.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.602
Your mother's name is Sawako Tainaka.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.812
That's correct, yes?

02:29.316 --> 02:30.817
Get out.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.987
I don't want...

02:35.322 --> 02:37.658
to hear that name.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.620
You're registered as an Unconfirmed Ajin.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.581
My apologies, but I can't do that.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.671
She...

02:56.134 --> 02:57.719
That woman...

03:04.726 --> 03:06.228
Hang up the phone!

03:09.231 --> 03:10.565
Sawako!

03:10.649 --> 03:12.192
Think about this!

03:12.567 --> 03:15.487
Her body is worth money!

03:15.570 --> 03:17.989
We'll never have to work again!

03:20.492 --> 03:22.119
Yeah, hello?

03:23.495 --> 03:25.580
Mom...?

03:25.664 --> 03:28.083
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.127
Yeah, you got it.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.672
<i>He's trying to sell me...</i>

03:34.673 --> 03:37.884
<i>Mom, are you letting the bastard</i>
<i>get away with this again?!</i>

03:58.697 --> 04:01.324
HOTEL

04:21.094 --> 04:22.763
It's all...

04:24.723 --> 04:26.767
All her fault.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.896
And I bet...

04:31.897 --> 04:34.441
she's still with that...

04:36.777 --> 04:38.403
son of a bitch.

04:38.487 --> 04:43.241
Not quite. Your stepfather and mother
are both dead.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.792
That's what she gets...

04:52.584 --> 04:54.211
for selling her daughter.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.338
No.

04:57.923 --> 05:01.760
I know you've been through a lot,
but you're wrong.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.805
What could you possibly kn--

05:04.888 --> 05:07.849
There was a recording of the call
placed to the police.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.770
It's probably from right after
you ran away from home.

05:13.772 --> 05:17.025
<i>-So, you'd like to report an Ajin?</i>
<i>-Yeah, that's right.</i>

05:17.901 --> 05:19.861
An Ajin.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.280
My kid, she's an Ajin.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.284
What?

05:30.622 --> 05:35.043
She... she's <i>my</i> daughter!

05:36.711 --> 05:38.129
You bitch!

05:59.234 --> 06:01.403
I'm... sorry...

06:03.196 --> 06:04.322
Yoko...

06:09.953 --> 06:12.080
And what do you expect me to do

06:13.873 --> 06:16.001
now that I've heard that?

06:16.751 --> 06:18.461
You were mistaken.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.467
It's too late.

06:29.598 --> 06:33.518
Too late...

07:03.465 --> 07:04.424
Mr. Tosaki!

07:16.102 --> 07:19.814
I work for the government. Do you think
you're going to get away w--

07:19.898 --> 07:22.108
Where is Ikuya Ogura?

07:22.192 --> 07:24.152
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:25.403 --> 07:29.366
That day, you shot the bodyguard

07:29.449 --> 07:31.826
and kidnapped Dr. Ogura.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.371
And you're still keeping him captive.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.039
Why the hell would I do some--

07:43.088 --> 07:47.467
The doctor is a top class Ajin researcher
in our country.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.596
Whatever you've done with him,
we're going to make sure he is returned.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.099
If you want to complain, tell it to Sato.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.558
He's the one who k--

08:10.490 --> 08:13.284
Knock it off with the farce, Tosaki.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.787
-Where's the doctor?
-I said...

08:18.665 --> 08:22.127
I don't know.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.757
It's not that you don't know...

08:27.841 --> 08:30.176
It's just that you forgot, right?

08:36.099 --> 08:37.600
Remind him.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.437
Yes, sir.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.825
What do you plan to do with that?

08:53.908 --> 08:56.202
Tell him, Myers.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.580
You're the one most familiar with it.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.249
It's Jianglide.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.585
It paralyzes your diaphragm.

09:03.668 --> 09:07.047
You'll feel as though
you're slowly suffocating.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.549
No, don't! St--

09:13.178 --> 09:15.889
We use it to neutralize Ajin.

09:16.389 --> 09:21.519
Tweak the dose right, and you can
keep them alive and in agony forever.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.038
Our schedule and location
have both changed,

09:40.121 --> 09:41.873
but this shouldn't be a problem.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.084
We'll start by using strategy pattern B

09:44.167 --> 09:46.419
which we worked up earlier,
and go from there.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.589
The changes have been marked in red.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.883
Be sure to look those over.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.636
Nakano, I'm going to test you
on it later.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.262
I know!

09:57.514 --> 09:59.599
Hey, isn't Ms. Izumi kind of late?

10:00.183 --> 10:02.644
I wonder if she went out
to eat with Mr. Tosaki.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.191
Ms. Izumi, glad you're back!

10:08.274 --> 10:10.318
What happened to your clothes?

10:10.401 --> 10:11.778
The minister's schedule...

10:11.861 --> 10:13.321
Mr. Tosaki's been taken.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.783
The Department of Defense found out
we were keeping Dr. Ogura...

10:17.826 --> 10:20.203
I'm going to rescue him.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.871
Nagai, we need a plan.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.041
Mr. Hirasawa, we'll need a place
to hide right away.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.461
Something temporary would also do.
Can you find one for us?

10:28.670 --> 10:30.630
Yeah, it's possible, but...

10:30.713 --> 10:32.590
Nakano, get the equipment packed.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.633
Equipment?

10:33.716 --> 10:34.843
-Wh--?
-Now!

10:34.926 --> 10:36.219
Okay...

10:36.302 --> 10:37.428
Nagai, what are you--?

10:37.512 --> 10:41.015
Mr. Manabe, Mr. Kuroki,
get whatever you need into the car.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.101
Mr. Suzumura, take care of Dr. Ogura.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.688
Could we please stop standing around
wasting time? We need to hu--

10:46.771 --> 10:49.107
Nagai! What are you doing?

10:49.190 --> 10:52.527
What do you mean?
I'm getting ready to move the hideout.

10:52.610 --> 10:56.156
What?! No!
First we have to get Mr. Tosaki.

10:56.239 --> 11:00.076
Yeah, Nagai! What about poor Mr. Tosaki!?
We've gotta go help him!

11:00.160 --> 11:03.454
How, exactly? Where is he being held?

11:03.538 --> 11:05.206
I don't...

11:05.290 --> 11:07.709
Our primary objective is to stop Sato.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.918
But Mr. Tosaki is--!

11:09.002 --> 11:11.588
We can be sure
that Mr. Tosaki's being interrogated.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.549
And if he talks, they're going to be
coming for us, here.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.801
And that means we're done for.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.261
But...!

11:19.512 --> 11:20.722
Mr. Hirasawa!

11:21.556 --> 11:22.515
Nagai...

11:22.599 --> 11:25.727
Mr. Hirasawa,
you said it yourself, didn't you?

11:25.810 --> 11:30.648
That we'd need to make decisions
that go beyond morals or emotions here.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.358
This is one of those times.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.570
First we have to make sure we're safe.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.197
Then we can start thinking about
our next steps.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.951
Thinking logically,
that's our best strategy right now.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.872
But, wait, what about Mr. Tosaki...?!

11:47.165 --> 11:52.795
If the positions were reversed, Mr. Tosaki
would be giving the same orders.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.298
-But...
-Get a move on.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.975
<i>This is a personal agreement</i>
<i>between me and you.</i>

12:08.853 --> 12:10.229
The organization doesn't know.

12:10.480 --> 12:16.361
Your job is to protect me from
the unknown threat coming from the Ajin.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.072
Yoko Tainaka is dead.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.991
Today is the first day of your new life.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.495
First, you'll have to pick an alias.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.038
An alias?

12:27.121 --> 12:30.541
You need a new name for a new life.

12:30.625 --> 12:35.129
It will be easier for you to get used to
if it's a name you can relate to somehow.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.883
Well,

12:39.092 --> 12:42.929
my real father's last name was
"Shimomura"

12:43.137 --> 12:46.265
and my mother's maiden name, "Izumi."

12:47.350 --> 12:48.559
That settles it, then.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.480
Let's get moving
before you catch a cold,

12:52.981 --> 12:54.857
Ms. Izumi Shimomura.

12:58.903 --> 12:59.904
Mom...

13:00.738 --> 13:02.573
I'm going to start over.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.495
And this time, I won't run away.

13:09.247 --> 13:12.667
Nagai, I've secured our next location.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.793
Thank--

13:22.677 --> 13:24.512
If I were Sato,

13:24.595 --> 13:27.348
I would have kept you locked up
for the rest of your life

13:27.432 --> 13:28.933
in a dark, cramped space.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.771
But you're not Sato.

13:33.855 --> 13:37.483
And if you can't even beat me,
how do you expect to stop him?

13:37.567 --> 13:40.278
We only have one chance to stop Sato,

13:40.695 --> 13:43.948
and that's to counterattack when he moves
on the minister. However...

13:45.408 --> 13:49.328
the only one who knows when is
Mr. Tosaki. Think about it rationally.

13:49.412 --> 13:53.958
No matter how I look at it, picking
a fight with the U.S. is irrational.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.337
We're done packing up, Nagai.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.973
Unpack everything.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.225
-What?
-Change of plans.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.145
We're going to go rescue Mr. Tosaki.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.438
Nagai.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.731
Nagai.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.277
If we're facing the Americans...

14:21.778 --> 14:23.905
at least it will be good field training.

14:25.031 --> 14:25.948
Thank you.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.992
No time for thanks.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.411
First, we've got to find out
where he's being held.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.705
Minami Azabu.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.501
There's a safe house
that we've used before.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.879
Four-eyes might be there.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.173
Why are you telling us this?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.675
Aren't you on their side?

14:46.260 --> 14:50.139
I'm not about to go home with
my precious sample right in front of me.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.894
We should be able to make it
to Minami Azabu within an hour.

14:55.478 --> 14:56.771
We should leave immediately.

14:56.854 --> 15:01.192
All right. Suzumura, move Dr. Ogura.
We've already got a place set up.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.110
Roger.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.653
Nakano, you pack the equipment.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.363
Yes, sir!

15:09.158 --> 15:11.619
-Nagai.
-We'll figure out a plan on the way.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.162
MEETING WITH VICE-MINISTER
OF THE CABINET

15:13.246 --> 15:14.330
Let's go, Ms. Izumi.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.391
Do you remember?

15:35.184 --> 15:37.854
I... I don't know...

15:38.146 --> 15:41.315
I don't know anything.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.611
-Myers.
-His heart rate is already pretty low.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.573
-If we keep this up--
-I didn't ask for your opinion.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.033
-Do it.
-Yes, sir.

15:55.163 --> 15:58.124
Must be tough being a lapdog.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.851
How many more IBMs can you use?

16:16.934 --> 16:18.227
<i>Probably none.</i>

16:18.311 --> 16:20.480
I know you're worried about Mr. Tosaki,

16:20.897 --> 16:23.149
but please do try to stay composed.

16:23.691 --> 16:24.942
I know.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.196
Damn it! Intruders!

16:28.321 --> 16:30.198
Where's the emergency power!?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.169
What?

16:43.252 --> 16:45.880
-The safety, dumbass!
-Oh, right.

17:05.149 --> 17:08.069
This is Bravo One. Living room is secure.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.864
We did it.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.366
Idiot...

17:15.826 --> 17:18.079
What is it...?

17:21.249 --> 17:22.166
Fire!

17:40.268 --> 17:41.477
Secure the area!

17:46.774 --> 17:48.150
Room C, clear!

17:48.234 --> 17:49.569
Room D, clear!

17:49.652 --> 17:51.696
Only Rooms E and F left.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.364
Alpha One, copy that.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.117
Hurry it up!

17:57.076 --> 17:58.286
Goddamn it...

18:00.454 --> 18:03.791
I'd say we've both had a bad day.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.007
Mr. Tosaki!

18:41.621 --> 18:42.913
Ghost!

18:46.042 --> 18:46.959
Go!

18:51.756 --> 18:55.009
Damn it, how did they know
our location?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.219
-We should try to get--
-Shut up.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.389
It's your fault
for letting that girl get away.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.309
I'm going to make sure you pay for that.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.524
Jesus, you can't even pick
the right road.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.152
I should just give you the shot right now.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.868
Where are they?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.623
They're still near the safe house.

19:25.706 --> 19:29.085
They just turned right up ahead,
but please stay calm.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.753
-You guys handle the cleanup.
-Yes, sir.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.131
-We're going to go ahead to cut--
-There's no time for that!

19:34.548 --> 19:35.591
They're not getting away!

19:54.652 --> 19:56.612
That's why I told her...

19:57.405 --> 19:59.156
Ms. Izumi! Are you okay?!

19:59.240 --> 20:00.741
Go around to the right here.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.576
Ms. Izumi!

20:05.371 --> 20:06.414
Mr. Tosaki?

20:06.497 --> 20:09.083
We're going after them!
Can we catch them, Nagai?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.460
-Yo! Nagai!
-Just shut up a second!

20:12.086 --> 20:15.589
This is not good, Mr. Hirasawa.
It looks like they're headed to...

20:16.966 --> 20:18.426
the U.S. Embassy.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.886
Well, this can't get any worse.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.472
What? Why?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.641
Embassies have extraterritorial rights.

20:25.766 --> 20:29.645
The police, the military,
nobody has any authority there.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.982
It means if they make it inside,
this is all over.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.275
But why?!

20:34.358 --> 20:35.693
Just shut up!

20:45.077 --> 20:46.996
TO BE CONTINUED

20:48.372 --> 20:51.417
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

20:51.500 --> 20:54.754
<i>I'll trade it</i>

20:54.837 --> 21:00.009
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

21:01.177 --> 21:07.433
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

21:07.558 --> 21:13.147
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

21:13.898 --> 21:18.027
<i>You can see them all</i>

21:20.321 --> 21:24.742
<i>When you come to my house</i>

21:24.825 --> 21:30.873
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

21:30.956 --> 21:33.083
<i>While the wind blows</i>

21:33.167 --> 21:37.421
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

21:39.548 --> 21:45.805
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

21:45.888 --> 21:52.186
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

21:52.269 --> 21:58.150
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

21:58.734 --> 22:01.445
<i>"Be my friend</i>

22:01.529 --> 22:08.327
<i>Always"</i>
