(woman on radio) <i>Thank you, Jack.</i>
<i>I'm Dr. Kelly,</i>

00:59.667 --> 01:02.000
<i>and today we're going to be talking</i>
<i>about mothers and daughters,</i>

01:02.066 --> 01:02.934
<i>the dark side.</i>

01:03.000 --> 01:04.867
<i>Here's our first call.</i>

01:04.934 --> 01:05.700
Hello.

01:05.767 --> 01:07.533
<i>You're on the air.</i>

01:07.600 --> 01:09.233
<i>I need first name only.</i>

01:09.300 --> 01:11.066
My name is Cher.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.834
<i>And your problem, Cher?</i>

01:15.900 --> 01:19.734
I have a 55-year-old daughter named
Dorothy, Dorothy Zbornak.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.233
She's got problems.

01:23.767 --> 01:25.400
<i>First names only, please.</i>

01:25.467 --> 01:26.834
I told you. It's Cher.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.467
<i>Zbornak. You said</i>
<i>Dorothy Zbornak.</i>

01:30.533 --> 01:31.867
Oh. Sorry.

01:31.934 --> 01:35.734
<i>So, what's wrong with</i>
<i>this Dorothy Zbornak?</i>

01:35.800 --> 01:39.333
She's still living home,
and she's cramping my style.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.633
<i>Have you done anything</i>
<i>in a positive direction</i>

01:42.700 --> 01:44.200
<i>to encourage separation?</i>

01:44.266 --> 01:46.400
When I hear her coming, I hide.

01:48.767 --> 01:50.934
-Gotta go.
-Morning, Ma.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.367
Good morning, pussycat.

01:52.433 --> 01:56.133
<i>♪ Dum dee da dum ♪</i>

01:56.200 --> 01:58.066
Blanche, hi.
Are you ok?

01:58.133 --> 01:59.467
Never better. Why?

01:59.533 --> 02:03.100
I've never seen you
do anything domestic.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.834
I've done the laundry
thousands of times.

02:05.900 --> 02:09.367
By the way, we're out of Bleock.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.600
-Blanche, you dropped these.
-Oh, thanks.

02:15.667 --> 02:18.100
Men's underwear?

02:18.166 --> 02:20.367
Getting a little misty,
are you, pussycat?

02:22.433 --> 02:26.233
I don't believe it. Blanche
Devereaux doing laundry for a man?

02:26.300 --> 02:27.667
Not just any man.

02:27.734 --> 02:29.433
-Rex Huntington.
-Rex Huntington?

02:29.500 --> 02:32.834
The guy who
stood you up last week?

02:32.900 --> 02:37.066
Yeah, but I like him,
so I'm giving him a second chance.

02:37.133 --> 02:38.800
That was his second chance.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.867
He stood you up before.

02:40.934 --> 02:43.367
You're enjoying this,
aren't you, Dorothy?

02:44.600 --> 02:47.166
Oh, yeah.

02:47.233 --> 02:50.567
Look, we've had lots of nice
dates together.

02:50.633 --> 02:54.934
He's a little unpredictable, but
that's what makes him so exciting.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.333
That and these.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.000
I wish Miles
was more unpredictable.

03:02.066 --> 03:04.400
I know where I'm going every night.

03:04.467 --> 03:07.967
We're in a rut.
It wasn't like that with Charlie.

03:08.033 --> 03:09.533
You want to talk about a rut,

03:09.600 --> 03:12.900
try spending three nights
in a row with this one.

03:12.967 --> 03:16.300
I thought you liked the
lunar landing jigsaw puzzle.

03:16.367 --> 03:20.900
Sure. It makes whatever time
I have left seem so much longer.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.266
I hate to admit it,

03:23.333 --> 03:27.533
but my relationship with Miles
is really getting boring.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.433
-We even make love the same.
-How?

03:32.567 --> 03:36.567
First he says,
"Let's go watch TV in the bedroom."

03:36.633 --> 03:42.300
Then I think, "Wait. He
doesn't have a TV in the bedroom."

03:42.367 --> 03:45.867
Then he says, "Come lie down.
I won't try anything."

03:45.934 --> 03:48.433
Then we have four hours
of the most boring sex

03:48.500 --> 03:51.200
you've ever had in your life.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.100
Four hours?

03:57.300 --> 04:01.533
I guess it could take less
if I stopped playing hard to get.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.967
(serene music playing)

04:11.433 --> 04:17.500
Ma, you put Buzz Aldrin's head
on Neil Armstrong's body.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.767
-I did?
-Yes, Ma, you did.

04:19.834 --> 04:22.266
I'm so ashamed.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.033
I wouldn't blame you
if you sent me to bed.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.600
Now. Right now.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.867
But, Ma,
it's important to be accurate.

04:28.934 --> 04:30.200
Now, look at the box.

04:30.266 --> 04:33.000
Hey, pussycat, it says here
"from ages 8 to 80."

04:33.066 --> 04:35.233
I'm out. I'm out.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.633
Come on, Ma.

04:38.633 --> 04:40.367
Hi, Dorothy. Sophia.

04:40.433 --> 04:41.767
You kids have fun tonight?

04:41.834 --> 04:45.233
Oh, did we ever. There's this
sewing shop on 4th street

04:45.300 --> 04:46.934
and in the back
they've got this Thimble museum

04:47.000 --> 04:48.600
I've always wanted to go to.

04:48.667 --> 04:52.033
You could put in a Thimble what
most people know about Thimbles.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.734
(laughs)

04:55.567 --> 04:56.633
No, that's not mine.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.467
They tell that one
down at the Thimble museum.

04:59.533 --> 05:03.433
You actually had a good time
at a Thimble museum?

05:03.500 --> 05:05.133
It was so-so.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.934
Again, that was not mine.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.133
They sell bumper stickers
out at the Thimble museum.

05:17.934 --> 05:19.867
How about tomorrow night?

05:19.934 --> 05:21.333
Dinner at the usual?

05:21.400 --> 05:24.767
You know, we've been putting off
that trip to Zipper town.

05:29.066 --> 05:31.100
Do you think we'll have time
after dinner?

05:32.033 --> 05:34.500
Well, Zipper town is always open.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.633
That was mine.
Just now, I swear.

05:42.734 --> 05:44.600
-Good night, Rose.
-Good night.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.900
Always open. Ha-ha-ha.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.533
Two hours of learning about Thimbles
from foreign lands.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.200
I couldn't wait to give
the headset back.

05:57.633 --> 06:00.133
Look, Rose,
have you talked to Miles?

06:00.200 --> 06:02.433
I think this is just who he is.

06:02.500 --> 06:06.834
I don't think I was bored
for one day with Charlie.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.500
He had a theory,

06:08.567 --> 06:12.834
"Even a trip to the bank can be
exciting if you wear a ski mask."

06:17.800 --> 06:19.834
He would say that often?

06:21.333 --> 06:25.800
Almost as often as, "Don't shoot.
It's me, Charlie Nylund."

06:28.633 --> 06:29.867
What's the problem, Blanche?

06:29.934 --> 06:31.900
Oh, Rex Huntington,
that's the problem.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.367
I've been stood up again.

06:34.433 --> 06:37.967
I feel totally unattractive,
undesirable, and ignored.

06:38.033 --> 06:39.934
Oh, Dorothy,
you explain it to them.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.900
Blanche feels the way
any one of us would feel

06:44.967 --> 06:47.767
if we were stood up three times.

06:47.834 --> 06:50.333
Three whole times.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.900
Three in a row.

06:52.967 --> 06:54.767
Count them. 1...2...

06:54.834 --> 06:56.700
Dorothy!

06:56.767 --> 06:58.300
Oh, I'm sorry,
Blanche.

06:58.367 --> 07:01.734
Come on, honey, sit down.
It's not so bad.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.667
Do what we all do.

07:03.734 --> 07:06.233
Our dance cards
may not be filled,

07:06.300 --> 07:10.533
but at least we can face
the lonely nights together.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.867
We're like sisters.

07:11.934 --> 07:13.000
You're right.

07:13.066 --> 07:16.233
Sisters united in the
battle against the opposite sex.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.734
-(doorbell chimes)
-See you later, sisters.

07:20.133 --> 07:21.266
It's date time.

07:21.333 --> 07:25.000
First, I'll let him
know just how I feel.

07:25.066 --> 07:27.033
Rex Huntington, where...

07:30.633 --> 07:32.700
It looks like he knows
how she feels.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.900
Wait here.
I'll get my purse.

07:36.967 --> 07:38.500
No. It's too late.

07:38.567 --> 07:39.500
We're staying here?

07:39.567 --> 07:42.767
I just came by for a kiss.

07:42.834 --> 07:47.066
Since I've done that, I'll just
take my laundry and go.

07:47.133 --> 07:51.700
Come on. It's not late.
You kept me waiting for hours.

07:51.767 --> 07:54.300
No. I'm sorry, baby.
I'm tired.

07:54.367 --> 07:55.834
But I'm dressed up.

07:55.900 --> 08:00.000
-I'm wearing your favorite perfume.
-Hey, I said it's too late.

08:00.066 --> 08:02.567
You think I come over
to get nagged?

08:02.633 --> 08:05.900
And to get your laundry.
Don't forget your laundry.

08:07.066 --> 08:08.066
Well, Rex, I--

08:08.133 --> 08:10.200
I guess I do owe you an apology.

08:10.266 --> 08:11.467
I think you do.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.300
This is better,
tomorrow night we're going out.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.633
I'll call tomorrow,
we'll decide where.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.600
We'll have a great time.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.000
Ooh.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.467
So that's a typical date
with Blanche.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.600
I mean, after you cut out
all the dirty parts.

08:32.300 --> 08:35.800
(mellow music playing)

08:40.333 --> 08:43.633
You know today's
teachers' lounge joke?

08:43.700 --> 08:44.767
Me.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.700
I know that joke.

08:50.233 --> 08:51.667
Everybody heard on the radio

08:51.734 --> 08:53.900
that some anonymous ma
was complaining

08:54.000 --> 08:57.600
that her dependent daughter Dorothy
doesn't have a life of her own.

09:03.734 --> 09:05.633
You think you're the only
gray-haired spinster

09:05.700 --> 09:08.633
substitute teacher named Dorothy
wasting her life away in Miami?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.867
I'm sorry, Sophia,
but in Dorothy's defense,

09:12.934 --> 09:15.300
that sure does sound
a lot like her.

09:17.667 --> 09:22.934
(calm music playing)

09:23.000 --> 09:25.700
(radio plays)

09:30.033 --> 09:32.867
-Hello, Rose.
-Oh, hi, Miles.

09:32.934 --> 09:36.133
Charlie and I used
to dance to that song.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.800
We've danced to it too.

09:37.867 --> 09:40.500
Not around a campfire,
hoping for rain.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.567
Look, Rose...

09:44.300 --> 09:46.200
Rose, we got to talk.

09:46.266 --> 09:50.433
Are things between us
getting a little dull?

09:50.500 --> 09:52.133
Oh, let's face it.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.567
You and I are yawn city.
Population, two.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.834
Miles, do you love me?

09:58.900 --> 10:00.900
Of course, I do.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.967
How much?

10:03.033 --> 10:04.300
Well, I don't know.

10:04.367 --> 10:05.567
Lots.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.900
Enough to jump
out of an airplane?

10:09.600 --> 10:10.500
Well, sure.

10:10.567 --> 10:12.600
Enough to climb
the highest mountain,

10:12.667 --> 10:16.567
swim the widest river,
jump out of an airplane.

10:16.633 --> 10:18.333
So, what do you say?

10:18.400 --> 10:19.367
Dinner?

10:19.433 --> 10:21.934
Then we'll hit my place
and watch TV.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.900
I won't try anything,
I swear.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.266
I have made arrangements
for us tomorrow.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.467
What arrangements?

10:29.533 --> 10:35.433
We're to show up at the hangar
at 10 o'clock for skydiving class!

10:35.934 --> 10:40.667
Well, you mean actually jump out
of an air, literally?

10:40.734 --> 10:43.000
There is nothing like skydiving.

10:43.066 --> 10:46.400
I mean, soaring through the air,
the freedom of it.

10:46.467 --> 10:49.633
The idea of plummeting
toward a pasture

10:49.700 --> 10:53.133
and watching a cow get bigger
and bigger...

10:54.400 --> 10:57.500
it's just something we should
do together before we die.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.800
Rose... couldn't I just run
towards you yelling moo?

11:05.567 --> 11:07.166
Too little, too late, Miles.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.266
We're jumping from that airplane.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.800
What do you want for dinner?

11:10.867 --> 11:12.400
Nothing too heavy.

11:14.700 --> 11:19.533
(soft music playing)

11:19.600 --> 11:20.934
Am I fat?

11:22.834 --> 11:25.133
What, no "Hello. Am I fat?"

11:26.567 --> 11:28.867
Dorothy, I seriously
want to know. Am I fat?

11:28.934 --> 11:30.967
Well, of course not.

11:31.033 --> 11:33.533
This guy Rex is ruining
your self-esteem.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.200
Did he say you're fat?

11:35.266 --> 11:36.734
Not in so many words,

11:36.800 --> 11:39.133
but I do wonder whether "barrel-butt"

11:39.200 --> 11:41.233
is a term of endearment.

11:42.533 --> 11:44.400
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.300
God. It's Rex.

11:50.533 --> 11:54.000
Oh, Rex.
You're right on time, you devil.

11:54.066 --> 11:56.667
-You remember my roommates--
-Why are you dressed?

11:56.734 --> 11:58.400
We're going
to a beach party.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.867
I could have sworn
you said the theater.

12:00.934 --> 12:02.433
Once again you're wrong.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.533
-Well, I'll go change.
-No. Just skip it.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.834
We're late. This is so stupid.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.700
What's wrong?
I can go change.

12:09.767 --> 12:11.667
No. There's no time.

12:11.734 --> 12:15.400
You're the one that's going
to be embarrassed, not me.

12:15.467 --> 12:16.867
I'll be waiting
in the car.

12:18.266 --> 12:21.433
Boy, he makes Wallace Beery
look like Adolph Menjou.

12:23.100 --> 12:26.300
Has been a while
since you've been to the movies.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.300
Blanche, this guy has gone
past being a challenge.

12:30.367 --> 12:32.467
He is really treating you
very badly.

12:32.533 --> 12:34.900
Dorothy, you'll see.
I'm just reeling him in.

12:34.967 --> 12:38.467
Look, I usually don't talk to you
about your dates.

12:38.533 --> 12:40.533
Nor do I talk to you
about your dates.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.300
Oh. Listen to me. I made a joke.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.734
Blanche, this is
no laughing matter.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.300
How can you take
this kind of abuse?

12:49.367 --> 12:50.867
Abuse?

12:50.934 --> 12:53.800
I'll have you know
he's never raised a hand to me.

12:53.867 --> 12:55.700
Verbal abuse, Blanche.

12:55.767 --> 12:57.367
He always talks like that.

12:57.433 --> 12:58.867
I just don't pay attention.

12:58.934 --> 13:01.066
Blanche,
you're making excuses for him.

13:01.133 --> 13:03.667
Can we continue
this conversation later

13:03.734 --> 13:07.400
when I find both the time
and interest? I have a date.

13:07.467 --> 13:10.567
Look, Blanche,
I'm only thinking of you.

13:10.633 --> 13:12.433
You know what I think?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.800
You ought to mind your
own damn business.

13:14.867 --> 13:17.367
-(honk)
-I'm coming, sweetheart.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.467
(soft music playing)

13:25.967 --> 13:29.800
Sea of Tranquility, come to mama.

13:29.867 --> 13:34.800
Lunar Module, you're out of
here. Yeah! That's it! Yes!

13:34.867 --> 13:38.667
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

13:40.200 --> 13:41.700
It's just a puzzle,

13:41.767 --> 13:43.767
you didn't make this much noise
on your wedding night.

13:45.934 --> 13:48.633
Oh, Ma, Ma,
it looks great, doesn't it?

13:48.700 --> 13:50.166
Sure. Let's bust it up.

13:50.233 --> 13:53.433
No, Blanche and Rose
haven't seen it.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.033
They have dates.
They get to see the real moon.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.400
Oh, I wish Blanche
wasn't out on a date.

14:00.467 --> 14:03.367
I just hate the thought of her
being with that guy Rex.

14:03.433 --> 14:05.800
I tell you, no man would ever
treat me that way.

14:05.867 --> 14:07.033
You know why?

14:07.100 --> 14:09.600
The whole city knows.
They heard it on the radio.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.433
Rose, how was your date with
Miles?

14:14.500 --> 14:16.600
We had a great time.

14:16.667 --> 14:19.433
He seemed much more exciting
tonight.

14:19.500 --> 14:22.467
Miles is living every moment
like it's his last.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.100
He bought champagne,

14:26.166 --> 14:28.700
and we toasted our first skydive
tomorrow.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.100
Your what?

14:30.166 --> 14:32.000
We're gonna go skydiving.

14:32.066 --> 14:34.567
You're going skydiving?

14:37.233 --> 14:38.767
A room with a view.

14:40.734 --> 14:43.834
A room with a...
I mean, good luck.

14:45.533 --> 14:50.767
(serene music playing)

14:52.033 --> 14:55.233
-Oh, hi, girls.
-How was the beach party?

14:55.300 --> 14:57.433
I'm not crazy about beach parties.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.567
I'm glad you got home safely.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.934
Are you still on that Rex thing?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.600
Listen, for your information,
he apologized and apologized

15:05.667 --> 15:07.633
about what he said
when we were leaving.

15:07.700 --> 15:11.800
Then he invited me marlin fishing,
just us two on the open seas.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.567
He says it's the ideal vacation.

15:13.633 --> 15:15.834
Sure. No witnesses.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.967
Blanche,
I know you find Rex alluring,

15:20.033 --> 15:22.467
but, honey, I know
where you're headed.

15:22.533 --> 15:25.600
I mean, I was once
in an abusive relationship.

15:25.667 --> 15:28.066
Stan was a yutz,
but he wasn't abusive.

15:28.133 --> 15:31.200
Not Stan. I've had relationships
with other men.

15:31.266 --> 15:34.066
Oh, yeah. The evil pen pal.

15:34.934 --> 15:39.200
What did Koo Duk Kim say in his
letters that hurt my little girl?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.767
No. It was in high school.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.233
Michael Tortelli. Remember?

15:44.300 --> 15:46.266
Captain of the football team?

15:46.333 --> 15:48.233
Oh, he was beautiful,

15:48.300 --> 15:53.467
black, wavy hair, strong Roman nose,
and he could read.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.367
Oh. Him.

15:57.433 --> 15:59.467
He was always putting me down.

15:59.533 --> 16:02.100
Made me feel
like I had no self worth.

16:02.166 --> 16:04.633
Dorothy, this has
nothing to do with me.

16:04.700 --> 16:08.400
Maybe Rex is right. Maybe
I have gained a few pounds.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.734
You are buying right into this.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.433
What makes you such an expert
on relationships?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.333
This is male/female stuff.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.200
This is what I know.

16:17.266 --> 16:21.433
If I need advice on jigsaw puzzles,
I'll come to you.

16:23.734 --> 16:24.967
Seconds after you jump,

16:25.033 --> 16:28.266
your chute will open automatically,
and you'll lurch upwards,

16:28.333 --> 16:31.867
unfortunately not high enough
to get back in the plane.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.233
All you have to do
is relax and enjoy the view.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.367
The only thing to remember

16:36.433 --> 16:39.166
is when you hit the ground,
tuck and roll.

16:39.233 --> 16:41.033
Tuck and roll. Say it.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.767
Tuck and roll.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.400
Someone didn't say tuck.

16:45.467 --> 16:48.266
I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.200
Well, that's good.
It'll keep you on your toes.

16:51.266 --> 16:53.467
Too bad there won't be anything
underneath them.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.400
Ok. We take off in five minutes.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.433
Are you excited?

17:00.500 --> 17:01.667
Dumbstruck.

17:01.734 --> 17:03.567
Oh, I know that feeling.

17:05.033 --> 17:07.767
I hope I remember everything
the instructor said.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.367
You must know
what you're doing.

17:09.433 --> 17:11.300
You did this with Charlie.

17:11.367 --> 17:14.433
-Well, we wanted to, but--
-But?

17:16.767 --> 17:19.200
I thought you two
did this all the time.

17:19.266 --> 17:20.967
Now, wait a minute.
I'm confused.

17:21.033 --> 17:23.767
You know, I feel like
I'm getting smarter.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.233
That's why we're
good for each other.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.233
What about all those
other things you two did,

17:29.300 --> 17:30.834
camping, tennis, boating?

17:30.900 --> 17:32.500
All the time.

17:32.567 --> 17:34.300
Well, maybe only once.

17:35.333 --> 17:37.800
See,
Charlie had this unnatural fear.

17:37.867 --> 17:40.867
-Of what?
-Camping, tennis, boating.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.734
Rose, don't you see?

17:42.800 --> 17:45.000
You're remembering
the way it never was.

17:45.066 --> 17:47.200
Then you're expecting me
to compete with it.

17:47.266 --> 17:48.700
That's not true.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.300
Listen, Rose,
I can't fight a ghost.

17:51.367 --> 17:54.333
Charlie's not only dead,
he's much younger.

17:55.467 --> 17:58.266
Look, Rose, you know
I'm nuts about you,

17:58.333 --> 18:02.333
but I shouldn't have to prove it
by jumping out of an airplane.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.800
I'm over 60.

18:03.867 --> 18:08.533
Well, so is Paul Newman,
and he still races cars.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.767
I don't want to be compared
with Charlie,

18:10.834 --> 18:14.100
and I sure don't want to be compared
with Paul Newman,

18:14.166 --> 18:17.567
although I do make a better
salad dressing.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.000
I don't want to be compared
with anybody.

18:21.066 --> 18:23.934
I'm the best me there is.
Isn't that enough?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.700
It is.

18:25.767 --> 18:28.600
I don't know
why I put you though all this.

18:28.667 --> 18:32.500
Now that I think of it, there were
times that Charlie was boring.

18:32.567 --> 18:34.433
I didn't love him less.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.367
That's all I ask, Rose,

18:36.433 --> 18:38.700
that you love me
even when I'm boring.

18:38.767 --> 18:40.934
Oh, I do, Miles.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.900
Ok. It's time to take off.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.400
-Let's go home.
-Ok.

18:47.467 --> 18:52.066
Rose, you say,
Charlie never did this.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.066
I think he was scared.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.066
He was, huh?

18:57.333 --> 19:00.200
Ok, Rose. Come on.
Let's go for it.

19:00.266 --> 19:01.800
I bet if Charlie had jumped,

19:01.867 --> 19:04.867
he'd have thrown in
a few somersaults.

19:04.934 --> 19:06.433
Don't push it, Rose.

19:11.633 --> 19:14.533
(calm music playing)

19:15.967 --> 19:18.033
I'm ready for the fishing trip.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.734
Suntan lotion and a string bikini.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.033
I don't want the fish to be
the only things nibbling.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.266
Or flopping around in the boat.

19:32.834 --> 19:33.934
Blanche.

19:34.000 --> 19:34.834
Yes?

19:34.900 --> 19:38.300
I've been trying to think
of something to say to you

19:38.367 --> 19:40.367
that would make you
come to your senses,

19:40.433 --> 19:44.233
and all I could come up with
is don't go.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.300
That's it?

19:45.367 --> 19:50.600
It would be wrong to let you go off
with this guy when you'll be hurt.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.200
Dorothy, you've had your say,

19:52.266 --> 19:55.100
but I don't agree with you,
so stay out of it.

19:55.166 --> 19:57.867
If you're trying to help,
you're kidding yourself.

19:57.934 --> 20:00.200
I forgot my lucky silver dollar.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.467
What's that for?

20:01.533 --> 20:02.767
To get lucky.

20:04.133 --> 20:05.533
(doorbell rings)

20:08.533 --> 20:10.700
-Hi. Is Blanche ready?
-Not quite yet.

20:10.767 --> 20:13.066
Would you like to sit down?

20:13.133 --> 20:15.800
-No. I'm in a hurry.
-She'll only be a minute.

20:15.867 --> 20:19.400
Now we'll run into traffic.
I hate when she does this.

20:19.467 --> 20:22.233
You hate
when she does a lot of things.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.300
-What?
-Nothing.

20:24.367 --> 20:25.767
I'm staying out of it.

20:25.834 --> 20:28.300
Want to go light a fire under her?

20:28.367 --> 20:30.633
-No, I don't think so.
-Why not?

20:30.700 --> 20:35.066
Because I think she's getting
burned enough as it is.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.533
Look, just tell Blanche
to hurry up.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.300
I've got to teach her
about being on time.

20:40.367 --> 20:43.900
Wait a minute. I don't want
you teaching her anything.

20:43.967 --> 20:45.633
You're starting
to get on my nerves.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.200
Good. You're already on mine.

20:48.266 --> 20:50.300
I don't like the way
you're treating Blanche.

20:50.367 --> 20:53.367
Under that make-up and sexy talk,
there's a little girl,

20:53.433 --> 20:56.934
and for some reason, she's letting
you take advantage of her.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.734
I can't stop her seeing you,
but I won't hurry her up.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.333
This is none of your business.
Just butt out.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.000
-You're hurting me.
-Stop that!

21:08.867 --> 21:10.633
Are you ready?

21:11.633 --> 21:15.066
-I think you'd better go.
-Oh, look, look. I'm sorry.

21:15.133 --> 21:16.667
Really, I'm sorry.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.734
You know I don't mean
these things I say.

21:19.800 --> 21:20.934
Just leave.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.600
If I walk out,
I'm not coming back.

21:23.667 --> 21:26.200
That's a promise
I'll see that you keep.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.200
-Are you all right?
-I'm ok.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.400
-I don't know what to say.
-Honey, I'm fine.

21:43.467 --> 21:47.433
Until I saw him grab you,
I couldn't see what he was.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.767
It could have been a lot worse.

21:49.834 --> 21:52.066
Most people in an
abusive relationship

21:52.133 --> 21:54.500
have to hit bottom
before they get out.

21:54.567 --> 21:55.500
You were lucky.

21:55.567 --> 21:58.633
Your bottom's a lot higher
than most people's.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.633
Well, I'm off.

22:02.700 --> 22:04.934
-Where are you going, Rose?
-To see Miles.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.200
Visiting hours at the hospital
are until 10.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.533
Please tell him
I hope his leg feels better.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.667
Oh, he feels great.

22:15.734 --> 22:18.367
He says a week in bed
is what he needs.

22:18.433 --> 22:20.633
Tell him I'll drop by tomorrow.

22:20.700 --> 22:23.734
I went by that Thimble museum.
I got him a Thimble from France.

22:23.800 --> 22:27.867
It's got this little man.
When you turn it upside-down, oh...

22:30.667 --> 22:32.500
I think I'll keep
this one for myself.

22:38.433 --> 22:40.934
You know,
Miles is a pretty exciting guy.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.033
I hope you know that.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.333
Oh, I know it now.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.867
You don't realize how much
you care for a man

22:46.934 --> 22:49.100
until you see him
streaking toward earth,

22:49.166 --> 22:50.867
trying to grab a bird.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.567
Boy.
He must really love you.

23:02.633 --> 23:05.266
Well, I love him too.

23:05.333 --> 23:07.567
Boy, am I glad I didn't jump.

23:18.700 --> 23:21.834
(theme music playing)
