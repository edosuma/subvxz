00:58.413 --> 00:59.681
Should we help him?

01:00.048 --> 01:03.684
He's due in the lists in two minutes.
Two minutes or forfeit.

01:04.051 --> 01:05.385
Lend us those.

01:06.553 --> 01:08.388
Right. Left.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.533
-Dead.
-Eh?

01:24.334 --> 01:26.569
Three scores to none after two lances.

01:26.903 --> 01:30.239
As long as Sir Ector doesn't
fall off his horse, we've won.

01:32.140 --> 01:33.742
He's dead.

01:35.410 --> 01:39.346
-What do you mean?
-His life's spark is covered in shite.

01:40.580 --> 01:43.116
His spirit is gone
but his stench remains.

01:43.316 --> 01:46.852
-Does that answer your question?
-No, no, no.

01:47.086 --> 01:49.421
No, he sleeps. Rouse him.

01:50.422 --> 01:52.690
I haven't eaten in three days!

01:52.924 --> 01:54.191
None of us have!

01:54.392 --> 01:57.761
-Let's fetch a priest.
-No, he's not dead!

01:58.094 --> 02:01.030
You wake up! Come on!

02:01.898 --> 02:03.132
Come on!

02:05.434 --> 02:07.202
You manky git!

02:08.603 --> 02:09.937
Roland.

02:12.039 --> 02:16.109
Squire, Sir Ector must report
at once or forfeit the match.

02:17.110 --> 02:18.444
He's on his way.

02:20.713 --> 02:23.181
I haven't eaten in three days!

02:23.448 --> 02:25.616
Three days! What did you eat, mate?!

02:25.950 --> 02:28.452
If you wasn't dead, I would kill you!

02:28.786 --> 02:30.554
I'll ride in his place.

02:31.955 --> 02:34.957
Strip his armor.
I'm riding in his place.

02:35.291 --> 02:39.294
Wat, stop kicking him!
I'm riding in his place. Help me.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.496
What's your name, William?

02:43.965 --> 02:46.900
William Thatcher, answer me
with your name.

02:48.568 --> 02:49.903
It's not Sir William.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.805
It's not Count or Duke or King William.

02:53.239 --> 02:54.239
I know that.

02:55.307 --> 02:57.609
You must be of noble birth to compete.

02:57.809 --> 03:01.979
A detail. The landscape is food.
Do you want to eat or not?

03:03.313 --> 03:06.516
If the nobles find out,
there'll be the devil to pay.

03:07.483 --> 03:09.418
Then pray that they don't.

04:50.099 --> 04:51.433
Visor.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.201
Come on, we're late.

05:27.462 --> 05:32.299
The score stands at three lances
to none in favor of Sir Ector.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.468
Lord Philip of Aragon.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.569
Stand ye ready?

05:38.904 --> 05:41.907
Sir Ector. Stand ye ready?

05:42.974 --> 05:43.975
Ready?

05:44.242 --> 05:46.410
I tilted against Sir Ector many times.

05:46.644 --> 05:49.480
In practice as his target.
You never struck him.

05:49.746 --> 05:53.249
-Badger me not with details.
-The landscape. Stay on the horse.

05:53.583 --> 05:57.152
He needs 3 points.
He has to knock you off the horse.

05:57.486 --> 05:59.654
I know how to score, Roland.

06:00.822 --> 06:03.324
I've waited my whole life
for this moment.

06:04.158 --> 06:06.660
For Sir Ector to shite himself
to death?

06:44.524 --> 06:46.992
Get it in the cradle. In the cradle.

06:47.293 --> 06:48.627
Get it in the cradle!

07:10.311 --> 07:11.645
William, are you alive?

07:11.979 --> 07:14.147
-We won! We won!
-Can you hear me?

07:14.981 --> 07:18.484
Get off me! William, can you hear me?

07:19.585 --> 07:20.819
We won!

07:21.153 --> 07:23.588
He's breathing. He's breathing!

07:25.189 --> 07:26.757
Sir Ector.

07:32.595 --> 07:34.764
Sir Ector. Remove your helmet.

07:37.933 --> 07:42.937
My lord, the final blow of the lance
has bent it onto my head.

07:43.271 --> 07:45.272
He says the final blow of the--

07:47.107 --> 07:49.609
I present your champion, my lord.

08:15.897 --> 08:17.064
Twenty.

08:17.398 --> 08:18.566
No, 10.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.301
-Fifteen.
-Done.

08:25.971 --> 08:27.573
Very good. Cheers.

08:32.409 --> 08:35.145
Fifteen silver florins.
He didn't want that.

08:35.479 --> 08:37.147
That's five for William.

08:37.481 --> 08:41.650
Five for Wat. Five for Roland,
who's going home to England.

08:41.984 --> 08:45.387
Straight to the pub for me.
Eel pie, brie tart...

08:45.587 --> 08:48.489
...tansy cakes with peppermint cream.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.461
We could do this.

08:54.661 --> 08:57.330
We've done it, boy.
That's silver in your hand.

08:58.164 --> 09:01.166
No, I mean, we can do this.
We can be champions.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.171
Give us your coins.

09:11.308 --> 09:12.609
Give me your coins.

09:16.378 --> 09:18.347
Now, that's one for you.

09:18.714 --> 09:21.516
And one...for you.

09:21.883 --> 09:24.452
Which leaves 13.

09:24.885 --> 09:27.521
That's 13 for training
and outfitting.

09:28.388 --> 09:30.723
The tournament in Rouen is in a month.

09:31.057 --> 09:33.192
We could split a bigger prize.

09:34.893 --> 09:38.363
In one month we'd be on our way
to glory and riches.

09:39.063 --> 09:44.134
Or lying in a ditch with Sir Ector.
William, I just want to go home.

09:44.401 --> 09:48.871
Tansy cakes. Dilled veal balls.
I'll take my five now.

09:55.610 --> 09:57.144
Oh, wait up.

09:57.678 --> 09:59.847
You're going the wrong way!

10:01.181 --> 10:02.582
You can't even joust.

10:02.916 --> 10:06.585
Most of it is the guts to take a blow.
Guts I have.

10:06.919 --> 10:10.255
And technique?
I have a month to learn that.

10:10.588 --> 10:13.558
And name a man better
with a sword than I am.

10:13.758 --> 10:17.361
-In the practice ring.
-You're not of noble birth.

10:17.594 --> 10:19.095
So, we lie.

10:19.429 --> 10:22.932
How did the nobles become noble
in the first place?

10:24.266 --> 10:27.936
They took it at the tip of a sword.
I'll do it with a lance.

10:28.269 --> 10:30.838
-A blunted lance.
-No matter, Wat.

10:31.105 --> 10:35.942
A man can change his stars. I won't
spend the rest of my life as nothing.

10:37.710 --> 10:40.946
That is nothing. And that's
where glory will take us.

10:41.280 --> 10:45.616
We're peasants. Glory and riches
are beyond our grasp.

10:45.883 --> 10:48.552
But a full stomach?
That dream can come true.

10:58.460 --> 11:01.796
If you can take your coins,
go eat cake in England.

11:02.130 --> 11:05.299
But if you can't, you come with me.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.806
You see? Money doesn't matter.

11:27.917 --> 11:29.185
See how hungry I am?!

11:29.652 --> 11:31.653
-Do you?!
-Damn your stomach, Wat!

11:34.255 --> 11:35.657
Roland, please.

11:38.826 --> 11:42.662
With 13 silver pieces,
three men can change their stars.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.004
God love you, William.

11:53.271 --> 11:55.606
I know, I know. No one else will.

12:09.550 --> 12:11.118
Unlucky.

12:12.219 --> 12:14.187
-I think he's getting worse.
-He is getting worse.

12:28.899 --> 12:30.033
Switch.

12:36.405 --> 12:37.740
Switch.

12:39.174 --> 12:41.209
Glory and riches. Glory and riches!

12:52.818 --> 12:54.353
You see how dangerous it is?

12:55.587 --> 12:59.257
Faster! Faster!
All right, use those legs!

12:59.924 --> 13:02.259
Come on, Roland. Faster! Faster!

13:05.095 --> 13:05.929
You missed it.

13:06.930 --> 13:08.931
You've done it dozens of times.

13:09.265 --> 13:12.267
Well, I guess that means
we should do it again.

13:14.769 --> 13:15.937
Come on.

13:18.272 --> 13:19.606
Come on, ponies.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.108
Fong him.

13:25.945 --> 13:27.780
Faster. Balance.

13:28.046 --> 13:30.615
No, slower. Keep it steady.

13:34.351 --> 13:36.120
I got it! Look, I got it!

13:49.964 --> 13:51.398
Any minute now.

14:23.324 --> 14:25.092
-Yes, better.
-Nice.

14:31.797 --> 14:34.233
-It's my turn to ride.
-No.

14:34.433 --> 14:37.135
We haven't reached the marker.
And you shouldn't.

14:37.769 --> 14:41.438
How would it look if my squire rode
while I walked?

14:41.739 --> 14:46.242
I don't give a witch's teat!
It's my turn! It's my turn!

14:46.609 --> 14:51.080
Maybe nobody should ride.
The horse is not what he used to be.

14:51.446 --> 14:53.915
Fine. Fine.

14:56.384 --> 14:57.418
Morning.

14:58.452 --> 14:59.586
Morning.

14:59.953 --> 15:01.254
Hoy, sir.

15:07.226 --> 15:08.193
What are you doing?

15:08.894 --> 15:10.962
Uh...trudging.

15:14.398 --> 15:16.533
You know, trudging? To trudge?

15:16.900 --> 15:19.235
To trudge the slow, weary...

15:19.569 --> 15:23.339
...depressing, yet determined walk
of a man who had nothing left...

15:23.672 --> 15:27.208
...except the impulse to simply
soldier on.

15:27.742 --> 15:29.310
Were you robbed?

15:29.911 --> 15:32.579
Interesting question. Yes.

15:32.780 --> 15:35.582
And at the same time,
a huge, resounding, "No."

15:35.915 --> 15:40.085
It's more a sort of involuntary
vow of poverty, really.

15:40.419 --> 15:43.922
But on the brighter side,
trudging does represent pride.

15:44.255 --> 15:47.925
Pride, resolve and faith
in the good Lord Almighty.

15:48.259 --> 15:50.927
Please, Christ, rescue me
from my tribu-...

15:52.429 --> 15:54.097
...-lations.

15:55.598 --> 15:57.166
Who are you?

15:59.768 --> 16:01.603
Lilium inter spinas.

16:02.270 --> 16:04.105
The lily among the thorns.

16:04.438 --> 16:07.107
Geoffrey Chaucer's the name.
Writing's the game.

16:14.013 --> 16:15.347
Chaucer?

16:16.515 --> 16:18.349
Geoffrey Chaucer, the writer?

16:22.353 --> 16:25.021
-A what?
-"A what?" A writer.

16:25.355 --> 16:30.359
I write with ink and parchment.
For a penny, I'll scribble anything.

16:30.626 --> 16:35.029
Summonses, decrees, edicts,
warrants, patents of nobility.

16:35.797 --> 16:39.033
I've been known to jot down
a poem, if the muse descends.

16:39.299 --> 16:42.302
You probably read my book,
The Book of the Duchess.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.872
Well, it was allegorical.

16:47.306 --> 16:51.142
We won't hold it against you.
Each man decides that for himself.

16:52.377 --> 16:54.478
Did you say patents of nobility?

16:57.047 --> 16:58.648
That's right. I did.

17:01.984 --> 17:03.719
And you gentlemen are?

17:05.319 --> 17:08.489
I am Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

17:09.390 --> 17:14.227
These are my faithful squires,
Delves of Dodgington...

17:14.895 --> 17:17.829
...and Fowlehurst of Crewe.

17:18.897 --> 17:21.233
I'm Richard the Lionheart.
A pleasure.

17:21.567 --> 17:23.867
No, I'm Charlemagne!
John the Baptist!

17:24.069 --> 17:25.403
All right!

17:26.237 --> 17:28.405
Hold your tongue, sir, or lose it.

17:30.274 --> 17:33.243
Now you see that, I do believe...

17:33.776 --> 17:35.077
...Sir Ulrich.

17:36.612 --> 17:37.746
Thank you...

17:38.614 --> 17:39.381
...Geoff.

17:41.382 --> 17:45.853
Have you any more to say, Master Nude,
or may we be on our way?

17:46.787 --> 17:49.756
-Off to the tournament?
-This is the road to Rouen.

17:50.390 --> 17:54.860
That remains to be seen.
They're limiting the field at Rouen.

17:55.460 --> 18:00.431
Noble birth must be established
for four generations on either side.

18:01.065 --> 18:04.034
Patents of nobility must be provided.

18:13.475 --> 18:15.310
Listen, clothe me...

18:16.310 --> 18:20.280
...shoe me, for God's sake, feed me
and you'll have your patents.

18:21.815 --> 18:22.982
No.

18:23.650 --> 18:27.319
-Patents of nobility.
-We need him. We need him.

18:28.086 --> 18:30.588
-Let me handle it.
-Be nice.

18:35.159 --> 18:37.160
Nice, nice, nice.

18:38.161 --> 18:39.496
All right.

18:41.164 --> 18:45.500
Betray us and I will fong you
until your insides are out...

18:45.834 --> 18:50.504
...your outsides are in and your
entrails are your extrails.

18:56.442 --> 18:57.777
Pain.

18:59.345 --> 19:00.846
Lots of pain.

19:10.520 --> 19:14.857
I present Sir Ulrich, whose mother's
father was Shilhard von Rechberg...

19:15.124 --> 19:19.961
...son of the Duke Guelph of Saxony,
son of Ghibellines, son of Wendish.

19:20.195 --> 19:23.297
-Wendish inherited the fief--
-That'll do, herald.

19:23.531 --> 19:27.367
Six generations is more than enough.
Show me the patents.

19:36.808 --> 19:41.145
Indicate in which events
shall your Lord Ulrich compete.

19:44.714 --> 19:47.884
He'll first meet Roger Lord Mortimer.

19:48.217 --> 19:50.219
Thank you very much.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.396
I can't believe it.
You did it, Chaucer.

20:03.730 --> 20:06.499
I thank you. I didn't think
we had a chance.

20:10.568 --> 20:12.236
My pleasure, William.

20:12.570 --> 20:14.905
If you don't mind, I'll stick around.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.741
Be my herald, you'll
get part of the winnings.

20:18.074 --> 20:22.278
Done. Now if you don't mind,
I have to see a man about a dog.

20:25.647 --> 20:28.449
Walking out from Cheapside

20:29.150 --> 20:31.785
My fortunes for to seek

20:32.486 --> 20:35.121
I passed along the River Thames

20:35.488 --> 20:38.457
Its waters did they reek

20:40.659 --> 20:42.928
'Twas there I met a pretty lass

20:43.161 --> 20:46.130
She said her name was Nell

20:58.173 --> 21:01.009
Bell or hell rhymes with Nell.

21:58.555 --> 22:00.056
Would you speak to me?

22:01.224 --> 22:03.225
Ah, to speak.

22:05.060 --> 22:08.229
Sir, my sex are marked
by their silence.

22:08.563 --> 22:11.232
I would hear you speak
if it cost me my ears.

22:11.565 --> 22:14.568
That is well, for I do not
want silence in my life.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.769
Tell me your name.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.507
-Would you care if I were ugly?
-Yes!

22:23.742 --> 22:25.910
I mean, no. I mean--

22:26.244 --> 22:29.079
You desecrate the house of God!

22:44.625 --> 22:45.793
Tell me your name.

22:46.793 --> 22:50.129
And what would you do
with my name, Sir Hunter?

22:50.797 --> 22:53.465
Call me a fox, for
that is all I am to you.

22:54.967 --> 22:59.470
Then a fox you shall be until
I find your name, my foxy lady.

23:04.674 --> 23:07.143
He's a handsome hunter.
I give him that.

23:07.510 --> 23:10.145
Does this not shock you, ladies?

23:12.447 --> 23:13.648
Certainly, my lord.

23:14.682 --> 23:18.319
I only laugh just
to keep from weeping.

23:21.388 --> 23:22.689
Beauty is such a curse.

23:24.290 --> 23:26.092
Pray your years come swiftly.

23:26.459 --> 23:29.428
Pray your beauty fades
so you may better serve God.

23:30.462 --> 23:33.798
Oh, I do, my lord. I pray for it all
the time.

23:35.466 --> 23:38.535
Why, God, did you curse me
with this face?

23:39.736 --> 23:43.706
God's will has a purpose,
but we may not know it.

23:47.475 --> 23:49.644
Well, that is lovely.

24:20.335 --> 24:23.671
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein...

24:24.005 --> 24:29.342
...defeats Roger Lord Mortimer
one lance to none.

24:31.777 --> 24:34.780
Easy. They'll think I
never broke a lance before.

24:35.013 --> 24:39.450
-But you haven't!
-Ulrich's broken thousands of lances.

24:39.684 --> 24:42.519
Come on. You're due
in the sword ring.

24:42.886 --> 24:44.554
My armor's loose.

24:53.228 --> 24:55.496
Shite. I can't block an overhead.

24:55.730 --> 24:59.333
We can't fix it now.
We're overdue in the sword ring.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.903
It was a mistake to do two events.
I'm too hurried.

25:04.237 --> 25:07.740
-I'll withdraw from the sword.
-Sword's what you're best at.

25:08.073 --> 25:11.409
But the prizes and prestige
are bigger in the joust.

25:11.743 --> 25:14.912
Ulrich von Lichtenstein?
I am Simon the Summoner.

25:15.913 --> 25:18.181
I'm overdue at the sword ring.

25:19.416 --> 25:22.418
I must detain you
on behalf of your herald.

25:23.252 --> 25:24.920
You were never robbed.

25:28.089 --> 25:30.358
I have a gambling problem.

25:31.258 --> 25:33.260
I can't help myself.

25:33.594 --> 25:36.429
And these people will...

25:37.196 --> 25:40.032
...literally take the clothes
off your back.

25:41.433 --> 25:43.435
What are we supposed to do?

25:43.702 --> 25:48.105
He assured us that you,
his liege, would pay us.

25:52.475 --> 25:53.776
And who are you?

25:54.310 --> 25:57.112
Peter, a humble pardoner...

25:57.479 --> 25:59.915
...and purveyor of religious relics.

26:01.583 --> 26:02.717
How much does he owe?

26:03.317 --> 26:05.853
Ten gold florins.

26:07.154 --> 26:08.855
You manky git!

26:10.657 --> 26:13.292
-Pain! Pain! Take the pain!
-Get him off me!

26:13.659 --> 26:15.394
Wat, let him go!

26:25.502 --> 26:28.671
What would you do to him
if I was to refuse?

26:30.673 --> 26:33.842
We, on behalf of the Lord God...

26:34.175 --> 26:38.846
...will take it from his flesh
so that he may understand...

26:39.079 --> 26:41.515
...that gambling is a sin.

26:45.184 --> 26:46.519
Oh, come on.

26:47.519 --> 26:48.854
Please, Will.

26:52.357 --> 26:55.192
Please, will you help me,
Sir Ulrich?

26:56.860 --> 26:59.029
I promise you won't regret it.

27:01.531 --> 27:03.432
I don't have the money.

27:08.870 --> 27:10.404
Release him...

27:11.205 --> 27:13.874
...and give him back his clothes.

27:15.642 --> 27:17.410
And you'll get it.

27:17.977 --> 27:18.878
Done.

27:23.648 --> 27:24.549
You lied.

27:24.883 --> 27:29.553
Yes, I lied. I'm a writer.
I give the truth scope!

27:30.053 --> 27:33.890
Behold my Lord
Ulrich von Lichtenstein, son of--

27:34.223 --> 27:36.725
-Too late. He's been announced.
-Fine.

27:37.059 --> 27:40.595
Ten blows by sword.
Sir Ulrich to receive first.

27:47.567 --> 27:48.568
Strike!

27:57.509 --> 27:58.676
Strike!

27:58.876 --> 28:00.244
Stop letting him hit you!

28:00.444 --> 28:02.413
Shut up! Shut up!

28:03.914 --> 28:07.083
Two strikes for Sir Walter Loring!

28:07.417 --> 28:09.585
Sir Ulrich to strike!

28:10.352 --> 28:12.087
-Now it's your turn!
-Come on!

28:25.598 --> 28:26.932
Strike!

28:29.301 --> 28:30.935
I taught him that!
That's me!

28:31.769 --> 28:34.939
Sir Ulrich prevails,
five strikes to two!

28:36.607 --> 28:37.741
Yes!

28:37.941 --> 28:42.812
Behold my Lord Ulrich!
The rock! The hard place!

28:43.045 --> 28:45.947
Like a wind from Gelderland,
he sweeps by!

28:46.314 --> 28:50.284
Blown far from his homeland
in search of glory and honor!

28:50.651 --> 28:54.955
We walk in the garden
of his turbulence!

29:01.960 --> 29:03.595
Yeah!

30:30.398 --> 30:32.566
-You're champion.
-Of the sword.

30:32.833 --> 30:35.068
Isn't that why we're here? Come on.

30:35.335 --> 30:38.738
Do you want to touch him?
Do you want to touch him?

30:54.851 --> 30:57.252
We should've saved our money
for the blacksmith.

30:58.253 --> 30:59.621
I can't pay you now...

30:59.821 --> 31:03.424
-...but I promise I will, just as--
-No! Money.

31:07.260 --> 31:11.430
-Excuse me.
-Cash first, not promises.

31:12.098 --> 31:13.699
Go on.

31:15.767 --> 31:17.435
Excuse me, sir.

31:18.436 --> 31:20.771
You might try the farris.

31:22.106 --> 31:23.440
A woman?

31:23.774 --> 31:26.776
Beggars cannot be choosers, my lord.

31:29.645 --> 31:30.946
Thank you.

31:32.314 --> 31:35.250
-Excuse me.
-I don't work for free.

31:35.483 --> 31:39.620
-I can't joust with broken armor.
-That's your problem, not mine.

31:40.654 --> 31:43.590
Each drop of this sweat
has a price on it.

31:46.492 --> 31:49.828
Just as well. They told me
I was daft to even ask.

31:50.929 --> 31:53.965
-Who?
-The other armorers.

31:57.267 --> 32:00.103
Did they say I couldn't do it
because I'm a woman?

32:00.837 --> 32:03.606
They said you're good
with horseshoes, not armor.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.274
No one mentioned you being a woman.

32:10.344 --> 32:12.012
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

32:12.513 --> 32:14.481
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

32:30.861 --> 32:33.863
Lady, I will win
this tournament for you.

32:34.130 --> 32:36.132
Nay! I will win for you.

32:36.365 --> 32:38.133
May I present Count Adhemar...

32:38.333 --> 32:42.203
...winner of the joust in France
and champion at Saint-Emilion.

32:44.872 --> 32:49.876
All forgotten when standing before the
most beautiful woman in Christendom.

32:55.214 --> 33:00.218
Do you only pretend to fight, Count
Adhemar, or wage real war as well?

33:01.218 --> 33:06.056
I am leader of the free companies.
My army is in southern France.

33:08.391 --> 33:11.060
Geoff, 'tis my lady.

33:11.727 --> 33:15.897
-William, you aim too high.
-I don't know any other way to aim.

33:16.230 --> 33:19.400
-Concentrate.
-What should I say to her?

33:28.106 --> 33:29.774
What do you think of the joust?

33:30.442 --> 33:32.276
It's very abrupt.

33:32.944 --> 33:35.446
And I don't understand the rules.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.114
Then I shall educate you.

33:39.115 --> 33:41.951
A match is three lances.

33:43.118 --> 33:47.889
One point is given for breaking
a lance between the waist and neck.

33:48.122 --> 33:51.292
Two points for breaking on the helmet.
It's difficult.

33:51.625 --> 33:55.629
The helmet sweeps back.
Most blows glance off.

33:55.962 --> 33:59.565
Three points for bearing a rider
to the ground.

33:59.799 --> 34:03.135
Also, if you bear a rider
to the ground, you win his horse.

34:03.802 --> 34:05.803
Do men die in the joust?

34:06.137 --> 34:09.572
Lance points are tipped
with coronals, which blunts them.

34:10.139 --> 34:12.976
Of course, accidents happen.

34:14.476 --> 34:17.313
I myself, Jocelyn,
have never been unhorsed.

34:18.513 --> 34:20.148
Nor have I.

34:22.949 --> 34:24.251
Your name, lady.

34:24.784 --> 34:26.587
I still need to hear it.

34:27.521 --> 34:29.755
Sir Hunter, you persist.

34:30.188 --> 34:33.826
Perhaps angels have no names.
Only beautiful faces.

34:37.295 --> 34:38.630
And you are?

34:39.864 --> 34:41.197
I am, um....

34:41.465 --> 34:42.766
Have you forgotten?

34:42.966 --> 34:44.900
Or your name is Sir "Um."

34:46.369 --> 34:49.538
Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

34:49.871 --> 34:52.341
I'd forget as well. What a mouthful.

34:53.141 --> 34:55.810
-Your armor, sir.
-What about it?

34:56.210 --> 35:01.048
How stylish of you to wear an antique.
You'll start a new fashion if you win.

35:01.381 --> 35:04.717
My grandfather will be able
to wear his in public again.

35:05.384 --> 35:08.220
And a shield. How quaint.

35:18.228 --> 35:22.998
Some of these poor country knights,
little better than peasants.

35:24.066 --> 35:25.567
--the second son...

35:25.901 --> 35:29.570
...of Sir Wallace Percival,
third Earl of Warwick.

35:29.904 --> 35:32.606
My lords, my ladies...

35:32.806 --> 35:36.409
...it is with honor
I introduce my liege...

35:37.243 --> 35:38.911
...Sir Thomas Colville.

35:46.250 --> 35:47.752
You're good.

35:48.919 --> 35:50.420
You're very good.

35:51.755 --> 35:53.256
My lords...

35:53.923 --> 35:55.491
...my ladies...

35:59.094 --> 36:02.830
...and everybody else here
not sitting on a cushion...

36:09.936 --> 36:11.604
...today...

36:13.272 --> 36:15.374
...you find yourselves equals.

36:22.946 --> 36:26.449
For you are all equally blessed.

36:27.617 --> 36:29.952
For I have the pride...

36:30.786 --> 36:33.121
...the privilege, nay, the pleasure...

36:34.122 --> 36:38.459
...of introducing to you
a knight sired by knights.

36:38.792 --> 36:42.228
A knight who can trace
his lineage back...

36:43.029 --> 36:45.131
...beyond Charlemagne.

36:47.132 --> 36:48.934
I first met him...

36:49.134 --> 36:51.369
...atop a mountain near Jerusalem...

36:51.703 --> 36:53.804
...praying to God...

36:54.305 --> 36:57.641
...asking his forgiveness
for the Saracen blood...

36:57.974 --> 36:59.909
...spilt by his sword.

37:00.143 --> 37:03.312
Next, he amazed me
still further in Italy...

37:03.546 --> 37:05.647
...when he saved a fatherless
beauty...

37:05.947 --> 37:09.584
...from the would-be ravishings
of her dreadful uncle.

37:17.190 --> 37:18.824
In Greece...

37:19.692 --> 37:22.527
...he spent a year in silence...

37:24.362 --> 37:27.498
...just to better understand
the sound...

37:30.033 --> 37:31.668
...of a whisper.

37:38.207 --> 37:41.876
So without further gilding the lily
and with no more ado...

37:42.210 --> 37:44.879
...I give to you
the Seeker of Serenity...

37:45.212 --> 37:47.881
...Protector of Italian Virginity...

37:48.215 --> 37:53.052
...the Enforcer of our Lord God,
the one, the only...

37:53.385 --> 37:57.389
...Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein!

38:10.566 --> 38:13.902
Thank you! Thank you!
I'll be here all week.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.275
That was different.

38:22.475 --> 38:24.644
It's time we celebrated
our differences.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.845
Just maybe not in public.

38:27.846 --> 38:28.914
You....

38:29.247 --> 38:32.917
Yes, I'm well aware
a good fonging is on the way.

38:33.251 --> 38:35.085
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

38:35.419 --> 38:38.521
I got their attention.
You win their hearts.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.106
Very good.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.275
-Was she watching? Geoff.
-What?

39:03.608 --> 39:05.610
-Did she see me?
-Yes, she did.

39:05.943 --> 39:08.112
-Did she see me take the hit?
-Yes.

39:08.379 --> 39:11.381
-Was she concerned?
-Her eyes welled up. Just awful.

39:26.293 --> 39:30.129
Colville has perfect technique.
I've never seen him before.

39:30.463 --> 39:31.797
Nor I.

39:32.131 --> 39:34.033
But this Lichtenstein.

39:34.299 --> 39:37.469
His technique, rudimentary.
Style, nonexistent.

39:37.669 --> 39:40.137
Still, he's fearless.

39:41.472 --> 39:43.473
Fearless? How so?

39:43.807 --> 39:47.643
The slit in the visor is narrow,
but splinters can penetrate it.

39:47.910 --> 39:50.913
Most knights raise their chins
at the last instant.

39:51.180 --> 39:56.150
You lose sight of your opponent, but
protect your eyes. Ulrich doesn't.

39:56.851 --> 39:58.986
He keeps his eye on the target.

40:00.187 --> 40:01.821
A true hunter.

40:11.863 --> 40:13.331
Sir Ulrich...

40:15.199 --> 40:16.166
...l'm through.

40:17.367 --> 40:20.703
But I've never not finished before.

40:21.537 --> 40:25.007
I wish to keep my honor intact.

40:50.394 --> 40:52.729
A draw. And Colville is hurt.

41:01.402 --> 41:05.072
Colville withdraws. Ulrich advances.

41:06.406 --> 41:08.241
Why didn't Ulrich finish him?

41:08.908 --> 41:10.743
He shows mercy.

41:12.578 --> 41:16.748
Then he shows his weakness.
That's all mercy is.

41:21.519 --> 41:24.588
For the love of victory, William,
go to sleep.

41:27.757 --> 41:29.091
I can't.

41:31.260 --> 41:34.262
Love has given me wings,
so I must fly.

41:36.931 --> 41:38.699
I can't explain it.

41:40.600 --> 41:44.337
-She makes me feel like a poet.
-You may feel like a poet...

41:44.537 --> 41:46.172
...but you sound like an idiot.

41:46.372 --> 41:49.274
-You don't even know her name.
-Her name?

41:51.109 --> 41:53.444
Her name is Aphrodite.

41:53.944 --> 41:57.447
Calypso. Venus. Take your pick.

42:02.118 --> 42:04.453
Women weaken the heart.

42:05.954 --> 42:08.623
Without your heart, you cannot win.

42:12.626 --> 42:14.728
-But her eyes--
-Concentrate.

42:14.961 --> 42:16.463
Tansy cakes!

42:19.298 --> 42:21.633
Count Adhemar sends word.

42:22.634 --> 42:26.137
He said he will win
this tournament for you.

42:26.971 --> 42:31.141
He's won many. He wins them
for himself and his own honor.

42:31.408 --> 42:33.810
It's nothing to say
he wins them for me.

42:35.845 --> 42:37.980
He wishes to speak to you again.

42:38.513 --> 42:40.615
Not to hear a word I say.

42:41.849 --> 42:44.251
Adhemar wants his women silent.

42:50.023 --> 42:53.259
Would you have Sir Ulrich
win the tournament for you?

42:53.525 --> 42:54.827
No.

42:56.027 --> 42:59.363
And he is the only knight
who has not promised to do so.

43:01.198 --> 43:03.834
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

43:04.701 --> 43:07.170
I would have him win my heart.

43:16.044 --> 43:19.513
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

43:23.716 --> 43:25.384
Oh, lovely.

43:26.385 --> 43:29.855
I don't think I've ever seen
Count Adhemar lose.

43:30.388 --> 43:33.357
No, but defeat him
and you'll see it firsthand.

43:35.059 --> 43:36.593
My liege.

43:38.228 --> 43:39.729
Sir Ulrich.

43:41.731 --> 43:43.065
Christiana.

43:43.732 --> 43:47.736
-My lady bids you wear this token.
-Of course.

43:48.403 --> 43:51.072
She also said to tell you, her name...

43:53.073 --> 43:54.941
...is Jocelyn.

43:57.643 --> 43:59.178
-Au revoir.
-Au revoir.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.347
Oh, Jocelyn.

44:05.750 --> 44:07.418
Concentrate.

45:30.017 --> 45:31.485
I can't breathe.

45:39.358 --> 45:41.160
No style whatsoever.

45:42.694 --> 45:44.496
But neither has an anvil.

45:45.530 --> 45:49.867
-He hits like a hammer. Amazing.
-But not perfect. He aims high.

45:50.133 --> 45:52.836
Roll your shoulder back,
his blow may go right.

45:53.136 --> 45:56.105
But if he strikes to my left,
I'll be obliterated.

45:56.639 --> 45:58.473
I didn't say it wasn't a gamble.

46:39.073 --> 46:42.742
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

47:34.283 --> 47:35.618
William?

47:43.457 --> 47:44.959
William, here.

47:46.460 --> 47:47.794
Come here.

47:56.801 --> 47:59.303
Someday I'll be a knight.

48:00.805 --> 48:03.140
A thatcher's son? A knight?

48:03.473 --> 48:06.309
You might as well try
to change the stars.

48:08.144 --> 48:09.979
Can it be done, Father?

48:10.312 --> 48:13.815
-Can a man change the stars?
-Yes, William.

48:14.115 --> 48:17.084
If he believes enough,
a man can do anything.

48:36.867 --> 48:38.201
Come here.

48:45.707 --> 48:48.176
Gain more bearing, Ulrich.

48:48.876 --> 48:50.845
See me again when you're worthy.

48:56.216 --> 48:58.050
I'll fong you in the arse!

48:59.385 --> 49:02.054
Well done, my lord! Well done.

49:02.387 --> 49:04.689
-You bastard!
-Go and see to Ulrich.

49:04.889 --> 49:06.724
Go see to Ulrich.

49:10.394 --> 49:12.062
Well done, my lord.

49:12.562 --> 49:14.230
A noble victory.

49:19.401 --> 49:22.904
My lady, I believe this is yours.

49:29.242 --> 49:31.911
For long spear on foot...

49:32.244 --> 49:34.746
...Pandolfo Malatesta.

49:39.917 --> 49:44.254
For sword on foot,
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

49:48.924 --> 49:53.762
Finally, for the mounted joust
and tournament champion...

49:54.095 --> 49:56.931
...Adhemar, Count of Anjou.

49:58.599 --> 50:01.434
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

50:04.103 --> 50:08.140
I present to you your champions.

50:12.944 --> 50:17.614
Next time, you will look up
at me from the flat of your back.

50:17.814 --> 50:21.884
Please. You have been weighed,
you have been measured...

50:22.118 --> 50:24.153
...and you have been found wanting.

50:32.126 --> 50:34.061
Keep winning the sword.

50:34.294 --> 50:36.729
-I won't compete in it.
-It's your best.

50:36.963 --> 50:39.632
No. It's tournament champion
or nothing at all.

50:45.136 --> 50:47.638
Ten florins. That should do.

50:50.474 --> 50:54.143
Sixes and sevens tonight, Chaucer.
Do you feel lucky?

50:54.477 --> 50:58.647
-Have you enough clothes?
-Be gone. I'm done with you.

50:59.481 --> 51:01.983
Except to exact my revenge.

51:04.518 --> 51:07.988
What on earth could you
possibly do to us?

51:08.355 --> 51:10.657
I will eviscerate you in fiction.

51:11.023 --> 51:14.326
Every last pimple,
every last character flaw.

51:14.693 --> 51:18.997
I was naked for a day.
You will be naked for eternity.

51:19.864 --> 51:22.333
I have a feeling we shall meet again.

51:25.201 --> 51:27.837
Here, farris, take what we owe you.

51:28.871 --> 51:33.008
The armor you wear, it wasn't
made for you, was it?

51:34.142 --> 51:34.876
So?

51:35.710 --> 51:38.679
I could make armor you wouldn't
even know you wore it.

51:38.979 --> 51:40.314
What's the cost?

51:41.882 --> 51:44.117
Just take me as far as Paris.

51:45.151 --> 51:47.986
We travel alone.
Take your gold and go.

51:56.393 --> 52:00.897
-Get what you can. Let's pack.
-Why are we leaving so soon?

52:01.230 --> 52:06.234
The next tournament is in a week.
We can walk now and save the horse.

52:06.568 --> 52:10.004
You must go to the banquet.
You'll dance and make an appearance.

52:10.238 --> 52:12.406
Let Adhemar laugh at me again?
No!

52:12.673 --> 52:14.674
-Yes!
-No!

52:20.913 --> 52:24.416
My lady would know the color
of your lord's tunic tonight.

52:25.083 --> 52:29.253
-His tunic?
-Yes, so she can dress to match him.

52:29.586 --> 52:33.189
We regret to inform your lady
he won't be attending--

52:33.423 --> 52:36.926
-Herald, do not give my answers!
-Yes, my lord.

52:37.192 --> 52:38.760
Squire, answer her.

52:39.094 --> 52:42.764
What color is my tunic tonight?

52:46.934 --> 52:48.268
Green.

52:50.436 --> 52:52.204
Trimmed in a kind of...

52:52.438 --> 52:54.273
...pale green...

52:56.108 --> 52:57.442
...with...

52:57.776 --> 52:59.944
...uh, wooden toggles.

53:01.612 --> 53:03.447
I will tell my lady.

53:09.952 --> 53:13.722
-This is a disaster!
-No, it'll tunic up quite nicely.

53:13.955 --> 53:15.957
That's not a disaster, Roland.

53:19.793 --> 53:21.461
I don't know how to dance.

53:23.963 --> 53:27.633
And one and two and three and four.

53:27.966 --> 53:31.302
Your hand should be light,
like a birdie on a branch.

53:31.636 --> 53:35.139
And one, two and three and four.

53:35.472 --> 53:38.642
And Wat doesn't lead,
he follows like a girl.

53:48.650 --> 53:51.819
And one and two and...

53:52.252 --> 53:53.820
...twirly, twirly, twirly.

53:54.187 --> 53:57.323
And one and two, and you're
still getting it wrong.

53:57.690 --> 54:01.326
And one and two
and three and four.

54:01.693 --> 54:04.996
You can hit me all day
because you punch like a what?

54:05.296 --> 54:06.497
A girl.

54:06.864 --> 54:08.832
-Enough!
-Get back! Wat, quiet!

54:09.433 --> 54:11.401
-He starts it.
-You know he's touchy!

54:13.870 --> 54:15.838
Oh, and you can do better?

54:16.372 --> 54:19.207
-Of course.
-Then show us.

54:20.308 --> 54:21.876
No.

54:23.544 --> 54:28.114
If I'm making all this effort,
you'd best ask her nicely.

54:32.718 --> 54:33.786
I'm sorry, Kate.

54:38.056 --> 54:42.026
I was wondering if you'd care
to show us how to dance.

54:43.160 --> 54:44.327
-Please.
-Please.

54:47.730 --> 54:51.233
And one and two, three and four.

54:51.567 --> 54:54.569
Five, six, seven, change partners.

54:54.903 --> 54:58.239
And one, two, three, four...

54:58.572 --> 55:01.007
...five, six, seven.

55:01.241 --> 55:03.076
Polonaise. And one....

55:04.010 --> 55:06.412
Are you wearing your hair like that?

55:07.513 --> 55:09.214
Is there another way?

55:38.304 --> 55:42.307
Sir Ulrich, you look fantastic.

55:45.310 --> 55:47.411
Jocelyn, you look....

55:49.980 --> 55:51.314
Uh, you...

55:54.750 --> 55:56.252
...remind me of the Bible.

56:01.923 --> 56:06.326
When God stopped the sun to give
Joshua time to defeat the Amorites.

56:09.929 --> 56:11.330
I don't understand.

56:16.334 --> 56:19.003
If I could ask God one thing...

56:19.670 --> 56:21.939
...it would be to stop the moon.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.676
Stop the moon and make this night...

56:28.010 --> 56:29.678
...and your beauty...

56:30.346 --> 56:32.014
...last forever.

56:34.182 --> 56:37.518
What dance will you have? A coranto?

56:38.552 --> 56:40.520
Or a basse dance?

56:41.555 --> 56:43.022
Sir Ulrich.

56:44.891 --> 56:47.960
Why don't you show us a dance
of your country?

56:48.727 --> 56:51.029
Show us a dance of Gelderland.

56:53.064 --> 56:55.199
Yes. Gelderland.

56:59.402 --> 57:02.238
Well, it's a lot like the farandole...

57:03.572 --> 57:06.408
...but with some differences.

57:07.575 --> 57:09.544
Well, you bow.

57:13.914 --> 57:15.382
And...

57:27.591 --> 57:28.759
...and....

57:42.770 --> 57:44.939
Places. Places.

01:00:54.624 --> 01:00:55.791
What?

01:00:57.126 --> 01:01:02.463
-I don't know. Too small, too light.
-He'll be crushed. Killed.

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:07.434
No. I found a new way to heat steel.
It's thinner, smaller...

01:01:07.634 --> 01:01:09.302
...but just as strong.

01:01:09.569 --> 01:01:10.737
What are these?

01:01:11.137 --> 01:01:14.807
The marks of my trade should
another knight admire the armor.

01:01:17.309 --> 01:01:20.645
Twist and bend. Feel the movement.

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:25.582
-But eventually I will be struck.
-And then death.

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:28.985
Do you at least have the courage
to test it?

01:01:38.425 --> 01:01:39.426
You okay?

01:01:40.994 --> 01:01:42.662
I didn't feel a thing.

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:12.686
-Who's that knight?
-Piers Courtenay.

01:02:12.986 --> 01:02:17.190
He's raised taxes on his land 3 times
this year to pay for tournament.

01:02:17.423 --> 01:02:20.226
His people starve while
he sits at banquet.

01:02:23.928 --> 01:02:24.896
It's probably true.

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:03.026
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

01:03:03.527 --> 01:03:06.196
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:09.198
The Count Adhemar...

01:03:09.865 --> 01:03:11.867
...son of Philippe de Vitry...

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.369
...son of Gilles...

01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:16.871
...master of the free companies...

01:03:17.471 --> 01:03:20.307
...defender of his enormous manhood...

01:03:21.041 --> 01:03:23.543
...a shining example of chivalry...

01:03:23.876 --> 01:03:25.711
...and champagne.

01:03:30.215 --> 01:03:31.716
Nice work!

01:03:33.217 --> 01:03:34.552
Bravo!

01:03:37.988 --> 01:03:41.157
Watch every move Adhemar makes.
We'll find a weakness.

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:43.058
Well, Colville looks fit.

01:03:43.392 --> 01:03:44.593
--my liege...

01:03:44.793 --> 01:03:47.529
...the second son of
Sir Wallace Percival.

01:03:47.729 --> 01:03:50.564
It is my deepest honor--

01:03:54.067 --> 01:03:56.336
My deepest honor to present to you....

01:03:57.070 --> 01:04:00.072
It's Edward, my lord.
They're sure of it.

01:04:03.074 --> 01:04:06.577
--the illustrious Sir Thomas Colville!

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:24.091
Adhemar withdrew.

01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:26.927
To withdraw like that means one thing.

01:04:28.094 --> 01:04:29.262
Royalty.

01:04:39.604 --> 01:04:41.605
I'll see what I can find out.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.108
Prepare to drop the flag.

01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:48.211
No, no. Not yet. Wait, listen.

01:04:48.444 --> 01:04:50.112
Musicians, announce.

01:04:50.379 --> 01:04:53.848
-I must speak with my lord.
-Then go.

01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:56.617
See if you can beat the Second Coming.

01:04:57.651 --> 01:04:59.286
Wait! Wait!

01:05:01.088 --> 01:05:05.458
Colville is Edward, the Black
Prince, future king of England.

01:05:05.825 --> 01:05:08.160
He's in disguise like me
so he can compete.

01:05:08.393 --> 01:05:12.130
He's never met an enemy without
victory or town he couldn't defeat.

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.398
We're English! We know who he is!

01:05:14.665 --> 01:05:18.001
-You must withdraw. Tell them, Geoff.
-Absolutely!

01:05:18.268 --> 01:05:19.169
The lance.

01:05:26.675 --> 01:05:28.009
Give me the lance.

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:36.683
Lance!

01:05:50.861 --> 01:05:53.029
Oh, my giddy aunt.

01:05:57.366 --> 01:05:59.868
The match is a draw.

01:06:03.037 --> 01:06:05.639
You mad? You endanger
a royal family member.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.041
He endangers himself.

01:06:08.875 --> 01:06:11.377
Well fought, Sir Ulrich, as in Rouen.

01:06:13.379 --> 01:06:15.147
You also, Prince Edward.

01:06:20.484 --> 01:06:21.485
You knew me?

01:06:26.723 --> 01:06:27.890
And still you rode?

01:06:29.058 --> 01:06:33.061
-It's not in me to withdraw.
-No. Nor me.

01:06:35.663 --> 01:06:37.331
Though it happens.

01:06:39.733 --> 01:06:40.734
Yes, it does.

01:06:43.403 --> 01:06:46.572
-Good luck to you.
-You also.

01:06:49.074 --> 01:06:53.244
The winner of the mounted joust and
tournament champion...

01:06:53.578 --> 01:06:55.846
...Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:05.254
-Melt it, sell it, do whatever you do.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.688
You're champion!

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:09.924
I'm not champion until
I defeat Adhemar. He withdrew.

01:07:10.258 --> 01:07:11.592
Sir Ulrich.

01:07:12.926 --> 01:07:16.763
-Tell me what you'll wear tonight.
-Nothing.

01:07:17.096 --> 01:07:19.932
We'll cause a sensation,
for I'll dress to match.

01:07:20.199 --> 01:07:22.701
Don't you get tired
of putting on clothes?

01:07:22.934 --> 01:07:25.436
She's talking about taking them off.

01:07:27.271 --> 01:07:30.274
A flower is only as good
as its petals, no?

01:07:30.607 --> 01:07:32.275
A flower is good for nothing.

01:07:34.777 --> 01:07:35.945
Really?

01:07:36.779 --> 01:07:39.781
You can't eat a flower.
It doesn't keep you warm.

01:07:40.048 --> 01:07:43.551
And a rose never knocked
a man off a horse either, did it?

01:07:45.919 --> 01:07:48.555
You're just a silly girl, aren't you?

01:07:51.824 --> 01:07:56.628
Better a silly girl with a flower than
a silly boy with a horse and stick.

01:08:01.332 --> 01:08:02.633
Goodbye.

01:08:06.836 --> 01:08:08.804
It's called a lance.

01:08:09.171 --> 01:08:10.639
Hello.

01:08:42.198 --> 01:08:43.866
-I have word.
-What?

01:08:44.198 --> 01:08:47.035
Adhemar was called back
to the free companies.

01:08:47.368 --> 01:08:50.304
Edward commanded it.
He could be gone all season.

01:08:51.372 --> 01:08:54.207
First Jocelyn and now Adhemar.

01:08:59.879 --> 01:09:01.212
Well done.

01:09:01.546 --> 01:09:03.715
Yeah, well done.

01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:16.725
The tournament results, my lord.

01:09:29.736 --> 01:09:30.903
Ulrich.

01:09:31.737 --> 01:09:33.072
Ulrich.

01:09:33.906 --> 01:09:35.073
Ulrich.

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:55.256
-Geoff.
-William.

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:57.758
I need to write a letter.

01:09:58.359 --> 01:10:01.027
"Dear Jocelyn." No.
"My dearest Jocelyn."

01:10:01.294 --> 01:10:02.629
Better.

01:10:06.365 --> 01:10:07.533
"I miss you."

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.168
Was that wrong?

01:10:10.368 --> 01:10:15.039
Well, it's up to you, really.
It's your funeral, I mean, letter.

01:10:16.106 --> 01:10:18.942
-Say something about her breasts.
-You miss them.

01:10:19.776 --> 01:10:20.777
Her breasts?

01:10:22.044 --> 01:10:27.048
Yes, you could, but I would tend
to look above her breasts.

01:10:28.449 --> 01:10:30.117
I miss her throat?

01:10:30.384 --> 01:10:32.720
Still higher. Towards the heavens.

01:10:32.986 --> 01:10:35.789
The moon. Her breasts
weren't that impressive.

01:10:36.089 --> 01:10:38.291
The moon? The moon.

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.461
"It is strange to think...

01:10:45.163 --> 01:10:47.298
...I have not seen you in a month.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.336
I have seen the new moon, but not you.

01:10:55.504 --> 01:11:00.141
I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but
nothing of your beautiful face."

01:11:04.512 --> 01:11:06.480
That's very good.

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:09.816
I knew this girl once who....

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:13.519
She broke my heart.
I said the pieces--

01:11:13.786 --> 01:11:18.456
"The pieces of my broken heart can
pass through the eye of a needle."

01:11:21.525 --> 01:11:23.627
He writes as though I had died.

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:26.829
Yes, madame. He dies as well.

01:11:28.531 --> 01:11:31.200
She used to cook for the Duke of York.

01:11:34.202 --> 01:11:37.538
I miss her like the sun
misses the flower.

01:11:38.038 --> 01:11:41.041
"I miss you like the sun
misses the flower.

01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:45.378
Like the sun misses the flower
in the depths of winter.

01:11:47.046 --> 01:11:50.215
Instead of beauty to direct
its light to...

01:11:50.882 --> 01:11:55.386
...the heart hardens like the frozen
world your absence has sent me to."

01:11:55.719 --> 01:11:57.721
"I next compete in Paris.

01:11:58.722 --> 01:12:01.891
I'll find it empty and cold
if you're not there."

01:12:03.058 --> 01:12:04.560
I like it.

01:12:05.394 --> 01:12:07.562
And now, to finish it.

01:12:08.896 --> 01:12:10.564
With "hope."

01:12:11.398 --> 01:12:13.567
Love should end with hope.

01:12:14.901 --> 01:12:17.737
My husband, God rest him...

01:12:18.171 --> 01:12:20.406
...said something I'll never forget.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.742
"Hope guides me. It--"

01:12:24.009 --> 01:12:27.511
"It gets me through the day and
especially the night.

01:12:28.579 --> 01:12:31.081
The hope that after you
leave my sight...

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:34.083
...it will not be the last time
I look upon you."

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.588
Finish it with:

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:44.525
"With all the love
that I possess...William."

01:12:45.959 --> 01:12:47.060
You mean "Ulrich."

01:12:49.462 --> 01:12:51.797
"With all the love I possess...

01:12:53.465 --> 01:12:55.300
...I remain yours...

01:12:56.134 --> 01:12:58.136
...the knight of your heart."

01:13:07.143 --> 01:13:11.313
My master hoped you might have
something to send him in return.

01:13:26.125 --> 01:13:30.929
Cock-a-doodle once! I shall not deny
him. Twice! I shall not. Thrice!

01:13:31.696 --> 01:13:33.264
I deny him.

01:13:33.698 --> 01:13:35.132
Thrice he denied him!

01:13:41.204 --> 01:13:42.671
No Adhemar.

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.607
No Adhemar.

01:13:51.312 --> 01:13:52.446
Wat.

01:13:55.548 --> 01:13:58.618
Tell me, did you see her?
Did she read the letter?

01:13:59.051 --> 01:14:01.019
Yes, and yes.

01:14:01.987 --> 01:14:02.888
And?

01:14:08.993 --> 01:14:10.460
She's coming to Paris!

01:14:14.063 --> 01:14:18.734
Did she give you anything for me in
return? A letter? A token?

01:14:19.334 --> 01:14:21.569
Did she give me a token? She did.

01:14:24.005 --> 01:14:25.339
Uh, I mean, um....

01:14:25.906 --> 01:14:28.575
Well, what is it? Give it to me.

01:14:37.415 --> 01:14:38.750
Yes!

01:14:41.085 --> 01:14:42.753
Hell, yes!

01:14:44.087 --> 01:14:47.924
She-- Because she's--
That means she-- Yeah!

01:14:51.727 --> 01:14:53.094
Cinquante.

01:14:54.295 --> 01:14:55.897
That's a nice round number.

01:14:56.664 --> 01:14:57.865
Excuse-moi.

01:15:01.568 --> 01:15:05.838
They wager that a Frenchman, not
Sir Ulrich, will win the tournament.

01:15:07.573 --> 01:15:09.241
But the amount is 50 florins.

01:15:09.508 --> 01:15:12.410
-That's all we got.
-If we had 60, it would be that.

01:15:12.677 --> 01:15:15.179
Ulrich against every Frenchman here?

01:15:15.412 --> 01:15:19.082
He's won four tournaments in a row.
And Adhemar isn't here.

01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:22.351
I check shields too.
John Beaumont's here.

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:26.188
Count Theobald, Philip of Burgundy--
all French champions.

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.956
Englishmen will not win...

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:29.991
...this French tournament.

01:15:30.324 --> 01:15:33.994
English legs are unsteady
on French soil.

01:15:36.429 --> 01:15:38.664
Shut your mouth, all right?!

01:15:40.332 --> 01:15:44.669
Come on, Roland. It's a good bet.
Win and I can buy my own tavern.

01:15:45.003 --> 01:15:47.838
-I could write full-time.
-A forge for me.

01:15:48.172 --> 01:15:52.675
And because French wine
is too much for English bellies.

01:15:53.009 --> 01:15:57.946
Listen, I'm about this fonging close,
mate. I swear to God, Quasimodo!

01:15:58.513 --> 01:16:02.850
All I want is to go home, and I've
enough for that trip a hundred times.

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:07.687
And most importantly, because
the pope himself is French!

01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:13.626
The pope may be French,
but Jesus is English. You're on.

01:16:14.726 --> 01:16:17.195
He won't lose with the princess
watching him.

01:16:17.495 --> 01:16:19.464
He's blond! He's pissed!

01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:24.367
He'll see you in the lists!
Lichtenstein! Lichtenstein!

01:16:24.668 --> 01:16:28.204
He's blond! He's tan!
He comes from Gelderland!

01:16:28.571 --> 01:16:30.539
He comes from Gelderland!

01:16:30.906 --> 01:16:33.742
Gelderland!

01:16:49.254 --> 01:16:53.224
-You think he will come?
-As sure as the sun will rise.

01:17:18.944 --> 01:17:20.779
You favor cathedrals.

01:17:23.448 --> 01:17:25.283
I come for confession.

01:17:28.619 --> 01:17:30.620
And the glass.

01:17:31.454 --> 01:17:34.790
A riot of color in a dreary,
gray world.

01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:37.459
Don't you think?

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.128
It's beautiful.

01:17:44.298 --> 01:17:47.134
I feel the same about
the letter you sent.

01:17:49.969 --> 01:17:51.637
Speak to me.

01:17:52.305 --> 01:17:54.139
Speak those words.

01:17:56.308 --> 01:17:58.576
I will win this tournament for you.

01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:00.411
Excuse me?

01:18:00.645 --> 01:18:05.649
I'll win this tournament in your name.
I'll defeat each knight for you.

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:10.986
Your beauty will be reflected in the
power of my arm and my horse's flanks.

01:18:11.987 --> 01:18:13.321
Wow.

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:15.823
Really?

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:18.659
Really? Its flanks?

01:18:21.995 --> 01:18:24.497
I wish to hear poetry, Ulrich.

01:18:25.998 --> 01:18:28.000
Well, I'm not ready.

01:18:29.835 --> 01:18:33.938
I am. Why must everything for
a woman be run on a man's schedule?

01:18:34.171 --> 01:18:37.674
Well, a man's day is fuller, and...

01:18:38.008 --> 01:18:41.010
...he has more demands on his time.

01:18:41.344 --> 01:18:43.345
-ls that so?
-Yes.

01:18:44.013 --> 01:18:45.180
Maybe.

01:18:46.515 --> 01:18:47.682
No?

01:18:48.016 --> 01:18:50.351
I demand poetry...

01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:53.854
...and when I want it.
And I want it now.

01:18:57.056 --> 01:18:58.524
Your breasts...

01:18:59.892 --> 01:19:02.361
...they're below your throat....

01:19:03.562 --> 01:19:07.698
Jocelyn, how may I prove
my love to you? How?

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:13.703
-Do you ask in earnest?
-Yes.

01:19:17.573 --> 01:19:19.908
If you would prove your love...

01:19:20.575 --> 01:19:23.411
-...do your worst.
-My worst?

01:19:25.079 --> 01:19:26.413
What do you mean?

01:19:26.914 --> 01:19:31.751
Instead of winning to honor me
with your high reputation...

01:19:32.084 --> 01:19:34.920
...act against your character
and do badly.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:36.588
-Do badly?
-Lose.

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:38.823
Losing proves that I'm a loser.

01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:42.559
Wrong. Losing is a much keener
test of your love.

01:19:42.926 --> 01:19:45.395
Losing would contradict
your self-love.

01:19:45.762 --> 01:19:49.231
It would show obedience
to your lover and not yourself!

01:19:49.532 --> 01:19:51.934
-Really?
-Woman, shh!

01:19:52.267 --> 01:19:56.771
Do not "shh" me and spare him!
Now be gone! Go!

01:19:59.873 --> 01:20:01.208
What is your answer?

01:20:04.944 --> 01:20:07.112
I will not lose.

01:20:11.883 --> 01:20:13.618
Then you do not love me.

01:20:27.295 --> 01:20:29.564
The Protector of Italian Virginity...

01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:33.467
...the Lance that thrilled France...

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.136
...the Harasser of Paraser!

01:20:36.469 --> 01:20:39.138
He gave them hell at La Rochelle!

01:20:39.805 --> 01:20:42.641
The Enforcer of our Lord God!

01:20:43.475 --> 01:20:46.477
The one, the only...

01:20:47.311 --> 01:20:49.646
...Sir Ulrich...

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:52.482
...von Lichtenstein!

01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:00.689
God, I'm good!

01:21:05.926 --> 01:21:08.261
His horse's flanks.

01:21:08.862 --> 01:21:11.864
Maybe where he comes from,
it means love.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:24.875
What are you doing?

01:21:25.275 --> 01:21:27.443
-Losing.
-I don't understand.

01:21:28.211 --> 01:21:29.278
Neither do I.

01:21:49.661 --> 01:21:51.229
He loves me.

01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:55.566
Are you blind?

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.235
-Did you see the flag?
-I saw it, okay?

01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:01.804
I know.

01:22:02.171 --> 01:22:05.307
You're dropping behind
for a more dramatic victory.

01:22:07.675 --> 01:22:10.811
Look, Jocelyn told me to lose
to prove my love.

01:22:13.513 --> 01:22:16.282
-I'd rather you were blind.
-Don't be foolish, Will.

01:22:16.516 --> 01:22:20.686
-Each woman wants proof, that's all.
-Proof of what?

01:22:21.453 --> 01:22:23.622
Her legs weren't uncrossed
for nothing.

01:22:23.855 --> 01:22:28.325
-I haven't uncrossed her legs.
-Then why are we doing this?!

01:22:28.692 --> 01:22:29.960
Because!

01:22:42.036 --> 01:22:43.471
Because...

01:22:45.039 --> 01:22:46.373
...I love her.

01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:32.176
-I'm going to lose everything!
-That's why it's called gambling.

01:23:33.411 --> 01:23:35.079
Pain! Here's your pain!

01:23:35.412 --> 01:23:37.581
It's very romantic, though.

01:23:38.081 --> 01:23:40.350
Are you a woman or a blacksmith?

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:42.351
Sometimes I'm both.

01:23:42.585 --> 01:23:44.420
Ooh, that chafes!

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:46.088
Put him down.

01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:52.593
No knight has distanced himself
with victories.

01:23:52.926 --> 01:23:57.597
If you win your remaining matches
and your opponents take key losses...

01:23:57.864 --> 01:24:00.366
...you could make the semis,
or the finals.

01:24:00.599 --> 01:24:04.369
-At least the armor's proven itself.
-And your love?

01:24:04.769 --> 01:24:06.270
Have you proven that?

01:24:09.773 --> 01:24:14.110
Wat, you remember church as a boy.
The fear, the passion.

01:24:15.111 --> 01:24:17.279
That's what she makes me feel.

01:24:18.113 --> 01:24:22.450
And for that, I say my rosary
to Jocelyn and no one else.

01:24:23.284 --> 01:24:25.786
William, that's blasphemous.

01:24:32.325 --> 01:24:34.126
Then may I burn in hell.

01:24:34.493 --> 01:24:35.627
Withdraw.

01:24:36.094 --> 01:24:38.296
Lose that way.
Take no more punishment.

01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:40.464
Oh, Roland.

01:24:46.336 --> 01:24:49.638
My lady sends this message.
If you love her--

01:24:50.005 --> 01:24:53.341
I know, I know. I must lose.
Isn't she watching?

01:24:53.675 --> 01:24:56.644
She says if you love her,
you won't lose again.

01:24:57.178 --> 01:25:00.647
She says if you love her,
you will win this tournament.

01:25:10.188 --> 01:25:13.658
There she is, the embodiment of love.
Your Venus.

01:25:13.958 --> 01:25:15.359
And how I hate her.

01:25:31.372 --> 01:25:35.975
-I don't understand women.
-Nor do I, but they understand us.

01:25:37.543 --> 01:25:39.211
Maybe not you.

01:25:51.321 --> 01:25:52.689
Yes!

01:25:53.456 --> 01:25:54.891
Women, eh?

01:26:18.476 --> 01:26:20.144
Forty-eight...

01:26:20.478 --> 01:26:21.812
...forty-nine...

01:26:22.146 --> 01:26:23.814
...and fifty.

01:26:24.081 --> 01:26:27.650
Thank you, gentlemen.
A pleasure doing business with you.

01:26:27.984 --> 01:26:31.753
Look us up if you're in London,
the world championships, maybe.

01:26:31.987 --> 01:26:36.157
Don't look too sad.
Here, have a drink on me.

01:26:36.424 --> 01:26:41.428
He's quick, he's funny and
makes lots of money, Lichtenstein!

01:26:59.676 --> 01:27:01.844
Guinevere comes to Lancelot.

01:27:07.849 --> 01:27:09.851
Bed him well, my lady.

01:27:10.351 --> 01:27:11.852
Bed him well.

01:27:18.724 --> 01:27:20.359
We missed you at banquet.

01:27:21.994 --> 01:27:22.861
"We"?

01:27:27.565 --> 01:27:28.866
I.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.701
Jocelyn.

01:27:32.569 --> 01:27:34.203
Your prize.

01:27:36.238 --> 01:27:37.806
My prize.

01:27:40.075 --> 01:27:41.709
I am not worthy of a prize.

01:27:43.744 --> 01:27:45.412
Then who is?

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:50.416
My maid tells me that
sometimes your varlets...

01:27:51.584 --> 01:27:52.918
...call you William.

01:27:56.421 --> 01:27:57.989
Is this so, Sir Ulrich?

01:28:01.425 --> 01:28:02.593
Yes.

01:28:04.428 --> 01:28:05.395
It is so.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.275
Your name makes no matter to me.

01:28:24.277 --> 01:28:26.779
Just so I can call you my own.

01:28:28.046 --> 01:28:30.715
But Jocelyn, I am your own.

01:28:38.121 --> 01:28:39.789
Damn, girl.

01:28:40.623 --> 01:28:41.958
You need a surgeon.

01:28:42.291 --> 01:28:46.394
He's been. He says I will live,
though it doesn't feel that way.

01:28:47.962 --> 01:28:50.965
Oh, William. This pain is my doing.

01:28:51.298 --> 01:28:52.966
Yes, it is.

01:28:56.803 --> 01:28:58.137
Although...

01:28:58.971 --> 01:29:00.306
...my father...

01:29:02.808 --> 01:29:04.976
...taught me to take the bad...

01:29:05.977 --> 01:29:07.478
...with the good.

01:29:14.817 --> 01:29:16.819
This good you speak of.

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:21.990
It will be my doing as well.

01:29:38.936 --> 01:29:43.340
How long since any of you have been
back? I've only been gone 6 months.

01:29:43.674 --> 01:29:45.508
Two years for me.

01:29:46.342 --> 01:29:47.677
Three years.

01:29:48.778 --> 01:29:52.347
Five. Five long years.

01:29:55.016 --> 01:29:56.350
William?

01:29:58.352 --> 01:29:59.520
Twelve.

01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:02.856
Twelve years.

01:30:05.458 --> 01:30:07.026
He's to be an apprentice?

01:30:11.896 --> 01:30:12.964
How long for?

01:30:14.565 --> 01:30:15.866
Seven years.

01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:50.761
Sir Ector?

01:30:52.929 --> 01:30:56.398
I'm the thatcher. I spoke to you
outside London Stadium.

01:30:56.765 --> 01:30:58.600
Oh, yes. I remember.

01:30:59.101 --> 01:31:00.568
Is this the boy?

01:31:03.938 --> 01:31:06.440
Step forward, son. Let me look at you.

01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:08.942
Careful with that, Roland!

01:31:14.446 --> 01:31:16.615
Are you afraid of me, boy?

01:31:26.956 --> 01:31:29.225
Have you got most of your teeth?

01:31:34.963 --> 01:31:37.131
Show me your arm. Is it strong?

01:31:47.306 --> 01:31:50.475
Well, he's a half-starved little
scarecrow.

01:31:51.809 --> 01:31:53.644
But he has spirit.

01:31:57.481 --> 01:32:01.984
I can show you a great wide world
full of adventure...

01:32:02.818 --> 01:32:05.821
...and marvels you
do not yet dream of.

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:11.325
Can you pack my horse and lead it?

01:32:18.164 --> 01:32:21.333
Well, come on.
Say goodbye to your father.

01:32:23.001 --> 01:32:27.505
He's a real knight, William.
Watch and learn all you can.

01:32:33.176 --> 01:32:35.511
It's all I can do for you, son.

01:32:36.011 --> 01:32:40.015
Now go change your stars
and live a better life than I have.

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:53.859
Roland, show the boy his duties.

01:32:57.562 --> 01:33:01.298
-Father? I'm afraid.
-Of what?

01:33:01.665 --> 01:33:03.634
I won't know the way home.

01:33:04.167 --> 01:33:07.970
Don't be foolish, William.
You just follow your feet.

01:33:27.186 --> 01:33:28.320
London.

01:34:15.725 --> 01:34:18.060
Give us a shout out, London!

01:34:40.077 --> 01:34:43.747
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:26.214
-Adhemar's here. He's entered.
-Must have grown bored with war.

01:35:26.448 --> 01:35:30.451
No, the Black Prince commanded it.
He had to disband his army.

01:35:30.718 --> 01:35:33.720
They were reveling,
pillaging town after town.

01:35:33.954 --> 01:35:36.789
Robbing, murdering,
ransacking churches.

01:35:37.123 --> 01:35:41.293
Committing the oldest sins
in the newest ways.

01:35:43.328 --> 01:35:46.297
At last we will face each other again,
Sir Ulrich.

01:35:46.664 --> 01:35:48.399
And at the World Championship.

01:35:48.666 --> 01:35:50.634
And as I promised you before...

01:35:51.001 --> 01:35:53.636
...you will look up at me
from the flat of your back.

01:35:59.508 --> 01:36:01.142
Let the past die.

01:36:02.176 --> 01:36:05.946
You've done well in my absence,
on the field and off, I'm told.

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:10.149
Winning trophies, horses, women.

01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:13.118
You put them in that order?

01:36:13.852 --> 01:36:16.588
Generally, with a few exceptions.

01:36:23.527 --> 01:36:25.195
Beautiful, isn't she?

01:36:25.862 --> 01:36:29.031
A real thoroughbred trophy,
don't you think?

01:36:30.199 --> 01:36:34.102
-You speak of her like a target.
-Isn't she?

01:36:34.869 --> 01:36:36.037
No.

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.641
She is the arrow.

01:36:45.711 --> 01:36:48.547
I've begun negotiations
with her father.

01:36:52.216 --> 01:36:54.051
I'm to make her my bride.

01:36:55.219 --> 01:36:57.721
She'll be saddled...

01:36:58.321 --> 01:37:00.556
...and placed on my mantle.

01:37:01.557 --> 01:37:03.659
Target or arrow, it doesn't matter.

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.228
I will have her.

01:37:11.665 --> 01:37:14.001
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

01:37:51.097 --> 01:37:55.033
-How would you beat him?
-With a stick, while he slept.

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:58.269
But on a horse? With a lance?

01:37:59.103 --> 01:38:01.438
That man is unbeatable.

01:38:29.828 --> 01:38:30.962
Hello there.

01:38:34.165 --> 01:38:38.435
-You're Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.
-Yes.

01:38:38.935 --> 01:38:43.239
You're my favorite knight.
When we joust, I always say I'm you.

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:48.076
What are you doing in Cheapside?
There's no parade today.

01:38:52.679 --> 01:38:54.281
Can you keep a secret?

01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:14.030
I was born in Cheapside,
just around the corner there.

01:39:14.363 --> 01:39:17.299
-Truly, Sir Ulrich?
-Truly.

01:39:17.533 --> 01:39:19.868
I only live just there.

01:39:21.636 --> 01:39:22.970
How old are you?

01:39:23.204 --> 01:39:26.440
-Nine and one half.
-Nine and one half.

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.144
I wonder if you remember a man,
though he may have died long ago.

01:39:31.377 --> 01:39:35.047
He was as tall as a knight.
His name was John Thatcher.

01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:38.016
-Of course I remember him.
-You do?

01:39:38.216 --> 01:39:40.384
Yes. He lives there still.

01:39:45.055 --> 01:39:49.058
Sometimes we see him sitting
at the window, but no one knows why.

01:39:52.894 --> 01:39:53.995
What do you mean?

01:39:54.562 --> 01:39:55.997
He's blind, sir.

01:40:42.267 --> 01:40:43.868
Is someone there?

01:40:48.606 --> 01:40:52.976
If you're here for the net,
I'm not done yet. Come tomorrow.

01:40:57.279 --> 01:40:58.280
Who are you?

01:41:01.282 --> 01:41:02.450
A knight.

01:41:05.386 --> 01:41:08.555
My name...is Ulrich.

01:41:09.789 --> 01:41:13.959
Ulrich? I hear that name
being chanted from the stadium.

01:41:14.393 --> 01:41:16.294
What business have you here?

01:41:16.828 --> 01:41:19.464
I have word, Master Thatcher.

01:41:21.999 --> 01:41:23.066
Word of your son.

01:41:24.334 --> 01:41:27.303
Of my William? Well, come in, sir.

01:41:33.341 --> 01:41:36.677
What word? Does he live?

01:41:39.113 --> 01:41:40.747
Aye. He lives.

01:41:42.849 --> 01:41:44.484
He is very well.

01:41:46.185 --> 01:41:48.020
He wanted you to know...

01:41:49.855 --> 01:41:52.290
...that he changed his stars
after all.

01:42:02.198 --> 01:42:04.533
And has he followed his feet?

01:42:08.203 --> 01:42:10.805
Has he found his way home at last?

01:42:12.306 --> 01:42:13.273
Yes.

01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:22.547
Father.

01:42:22.881 --> 01:42:25.717
Oh, William. Oh, my boy.

01:42:36.659 --> 01:42:39.995
I should like to meet this Wat.
And Roland too.

01:42:40.228 --> 01:42:42.230
You will, Father.

01:42:45.232 --> 01:42:49.069
And what of women?
Is there a certain one or many?

01:42:50.903 --> 01:42:52.571
There is a certain one.

01:42:54.406 --> 01:42:56.408
I should like to meet her too.

01:43:02.913 --> 01:43:05.248
This leak won't do, Father.

01:43:05.849 --> 01:43:10.586
-Not in a thatcher's chamber.
-It's quite fitting for a blind one.

01:43:12.921 --> 01:43:14.756
Well, a thatcher I am.

01:43:16.424 --> 01:43:17.758
I'll fix it.

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:02.260
Alive. I thought he was dead,
which is mad...

01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:05.296
Alive. I thought he was dead,
which is mad...

01:44:05.596 --> 01:44:08.799
...because he was also so strong.
Very strong.

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.468
-Geoff.
-Jocelyn.

01:44:11.835 --> 01:44:14.270
This day just gets better and better.

01:44:17.272 --> 01:44:18.407
Somebody die?

01:44:21.676 --> 01:44:23.644
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

01:44:27.347 --> 01:44:28.682
Adhemar...

01:44:29.682 --> 01:44:33.152
...followed you last night.
To Cheapside.

01:44:33.952 --> 01:44:35.287
He saw your father.

01:44:36.521 --> 01:44:39.290
Will, they asked me for your patents.

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:47.130
They're waiting for you
in the lists to arrest you.

01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:49.698
A dozen royal guards.

01:44:50.866 --> 01:44:55.837
-They'll put you in the stocks.
-But I face Adhemar in five minutes.

01:44:57.371 --> 01:45:01.208
No, you forfeit.
They've already marked it down.

01:45:02.375 --> 01:45:05.711
Saddle the horses.
They can arrest your baggage, not you.

01:45:11.883 --> 01:45:13.384
Halt.

01:45:18.722 --> 01:45:20.390
So, what do you think...

01:45:22.892 --> 01:45:24.827
...now that you know what I am?

01:45:26.228 --> 01:45:30.398
To know what you are, William,
would take a lifetime.

01:45:31.065 --> 01:45:33.900
One I am willing to give.
But now you must run.

01:45:35.735 --> 01:45:38.070
Run, and I will run with you.

01:45:38.404 --> 01:45:40.406
Jocelyn, I cannot run.

01:45:40.739 --> 01:45:44.242
I am a knight, and I will
put myself to the hazard!

01:45:44.576 --> 01:45:48.412
In your heart, not on paper.
And paper's what matters to them!

01:45:51.581 --> 01:45:53.716
William, I love you.

01:45:55.751 --> 01:45:58.086
I love you. You.

01:46:00.588 --> 01:46:05.192
-I won't see you led to the stocks.
-But you'll see me run? No!

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:08.428
Damn your pride, William.

01:46:08.928 --> 01:46:11.764
It is only you that
will not see you run.

01:46:12.031 --> 01:46:14.266
Pride's the one thing they can't take!

01:46:14.533 --> 01:46:18.036
But they can take it from you.
They can and they will.

01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:20.271
Oh, they will.

01:46:21.105 --> 01:46:23.440
But love they cannot take.

01:46:28.778 --> 01:46:31.113
And where will we live?

01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.782
In my hovel?

01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:40.787
-With the pigs inside in winter?
-Yes, William, with the pigs.

01:46:41.021 --> 01:46:42.389
With the pigs.

01:46:45.458 --> 01:46:47.126
The poor can marry for love.

01:46:48.961 --> 01:46:51.796
Jocelyn, you speak of what
you do not know!

01:46:55.666 --> 01:46:57.634
William, I beg you.

01:46:58.501 --> 01:46:59.803
Please.

01:47:02.338 --> 01:47:04.073
Run. Do it for love.

01:47:12.112 --> 01:47:13.814
Roland, you would see me run?

01:47:20.853 --> 01:47:21.987
And you, Geoff?

01:47:22.854 --> 01:47:25.690
I wish it too, with all
the pieces of my heart.

01:47:32.028 --> 01:47:35.197
Wat? You and I? We aren't runners.

01:47:39.868 --> 01:47:41.035
Yes.

01:47:43.037 --> 01:47:44.805
William, today we are.

01:47:48.208 --> 01:47:49.542
Run, William.

01:47:56.381 --> 01:47:58.383
I will not run!

01:48:05.722 --> 01:48:07.223
I am a knight.

01:48:20.234 --> 01:48:21.568
Well, boys...

01:48:22.168 --> 01:48:24.570
...all good things must come to an end.

01:48:25.504 --> 01:48:27.406
Let's end them together.

01:49:04.602 --> 01:49:08.272
You will remove yourself
from this position of honor.

01:49:10.374 --> 01:49:11.708
I am here to compete.

01:49:12.108 --> 01:49:14.444
You are here to be arrested.

01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:23.284
All right!

01:49:51.673 --> 01:49:54.309
He that strives to touch a star...

01:49:55.176 --> 01:49:56.811
...oft stumbles...

01:49:57.178 --> 01:49:58.812
...at a simple straw.

01:50:09.855 --> 01:50:11.489
You have been weighed.

01:50:19.195 --> 01:50:20.863
You have been measured.

01:50:23.866 --> 01:50:25.634
And you have been found wanting.

01:50:31.205 --> 01:50:34.207
It's one loss or another...William.

01:50:40.312 --> 01:50:44.049
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

01:51:22.313 --> 01:51:23.814
Leave, Roland.

01:51:24.881 --> 01:51:26.216
Let them have me.

01:51:27.216 --> 01:51:29.051
God love you, William.

01:51:29.385 --> 01:51:30.819
So do I.

01:51:31.386 --> 01:51:33.555
Go! Disperse!

01:51:35.823 --> 01:51:37.491
Or I will fong you!

01:51:38.058 --> 01:51:40.994
As Jesus Christ the Nazarene
and his holy mother...

01:51:41.228 --> 01:51:44.831
...the Virgin Mary are my witnesses,
I will fong you!

01:51:45.731 --> 01:51:48.400
I will rip you! Fist! Pain!

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.970
I'll stick my fist and break you!
Pain! Lots of pain!

01:51:59.242 --> 01:52:00.677
We're in trouble.

01:52:04.413 --> 01:52:06.081
Listen to me.

01:52:10.751 --> 01:52:12.753
Listen to me!

01:52:45.479 --> 01:52:47.814
What a pair we make, huh?

01:52:51.317 --> 01:52:53.452
Both trying to hide who we are.

01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:56.154
Both unable to do so.

01:53:05.161 --> 01:53:06.996
Your men love you.

01:53:09.165 --> 01:53:12.334
If I knew nothing else about you,
that would be enough.

01:53:13.835 --> 01:53:17.671
But you also tilt
when you should withdraw.

01:53:20.173 --> 01:53:22.108
That is knightly too.

01:53:30.348 --> 01:53:31.516
Release him.

01:53:41.524 --> 01:53:44.526
He may appear to be
of humble origins...

01:53:45.794 --> 01:53:48.863
...but my personal historians
have discovered...

01:53:49.197 --> 01:53:52.800
...that he descends
from an ancient royal line.

01:53:56.202 --> 01:53:57.870
This is my word.

01:53:59.371 --> 01:54:02.874
And as such, is beyond contestation.

01:54:08.212 --> 01:54:09.146
Now...

01:54:10.547 --> 01:54:13.883
...if I may repay the kindness
you once showed me.

01:54:15.218 --> 01:54:16.218
Take a knee.

01:54:33.232 --> 01:54:37.235
By the power vested in me
by my father, King Edward...

01:54:38.403 --> 01:54:40.905
...and by all the witnesses here...

01:54:44.074 --> 01:54:45.408
...I dub thee...

01:54:48.077 --> 01:54:49.412
...Sir William.

01:55:01.688 --> 01:55:04.257
Arise...Sir William.

01:55:11.596 --> 01:55:12.930
Can you joust?

01:55:14.598 --> 01:55:16.600
There's my tournament to finish.

01:55:17.134 --> 01:55:21.604
Now, are you fit to compete,
or shall the forfeit stand?

01:55:22.471 --> 01:55:23.405
I'm fit.

01:55:24.807 --> 01:55:29.744
I shall have your opponent informed.
Look for his shield on the lists.

01:55:30.311 --> 01:55:31.645
At once.

01:55:32.313 --> 01:55:33.747
Thank you, my lord.

01:55:44.155 --> 01:55:46.624
All hail Prince Edward!

01:55:51.661 --> 01:55:53.997
My lords, my ladies...

01:55:54.831 --> 01:55:57.299
...and all you other people.

01:55:58.167 --> 01:56:02.837
I give you the son of Philippe
de Vitry, son of Gilles....

01:56:05.506 --> 01:56:07.507
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

01:56:08.175 --> 01:56:11.177
It's nothing but spun sugar
and boot black.

01:56:20.184 --> 01:56:21.785
It's a small target...

01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:25.188
...but aim for his heart.

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:33.595
--doer of daring deeds...

01:56:34.863 --> 01:56:38.199
...conqueror of countless kingdoms,
Count...

01:56:42.035 --> 01:56:43.703
...Adhemar!

01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:30.789
Oh, God. I'll get the surgeon.

01:58:31.156 --> 01:58:32.123
Roland!

01:58:32.757 --> 01:58:33.891
You're the surgeon.

01:58:36.326 --> 01:58:37.461
Come on.

01:58:45.267 --> 01:58:46.301
He tipped it.

01:58:49.170 --> 01:58:51.338
Kate, get me back to one.

01:58:51.672 --> 01:58:53.674
Otherwise we forfeit.

01:59:00.846 --> 01:59:03.014
Dirty son of a bitch!

02:00:13.237 --> 02:00:16.573
Kate, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

02:00:23.245 --> 02:00:25.414
As I said, thatcher.

02:00:27.582 --> 02:00:30.584
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

02:00:31.252 --> 02:00:33.187
Such a place does not exist.

02:00:35.622 --> 02:00:36.523
She's here.

02:00:39.525 --> 02:00:40.592
With your father.

02:00:45.096 --> 02:00:46.697
Change your stars.

02:00:51.735 --> 02:00:53.536
Let's dance, you and I.

02:00:57.306 --> 02:00:58.940
It's two lances to none.

02:00:59.307 --> 02:01:02.944
You must unhorse him or kill him.
It's the only way to win.

02:01:12.985 --> 02:01:15.821
-You need more padding.
-No, leave it off.

02:01:16.488 --> 02:01:18.122
I can't breathe with it on.

02:01:23.827 --> 02:01:24.895
Lance.

02:01:30.332 --> 02:01:31.900
I can barely grip it.

02:01:32.167 --> 02:01:33.501
Damn.

02:01:40.173 --> 02:01:41.508
Lash it to my arm.

02:01:45.678 --> 02:01:46.845
Wat...

02:01:47.613 --> 02:01:49.114
...lash it to me arm.

02:01:52.283 --> 02:01:53.351
Do it.

02:02:11.632 --> 02:02:13.133
Good people!

02:02:14.201 --> 02:02:15.535
I missed my introduction!

02:02:26.711 --> 02:02:28.379
But please...

02:02:28.712 --> 02:02:30.380
...please, I pray you.

02:02:30.881 --> 02:02:32.382
Hear it now.

02:02:33.716 --> 02:02:35.718
For I would lay rest...

02:02:36.052 --> 02:02:38.387
...the grace in my tongue...

02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:40.388
...and speak plain.

02:02:41.556 --> 02:02:43.391
Days like these...

02:02:43.724 --> 02:02:47.394
...are far too rare to cheapen
with heavy-handed words.

02:02:48.728 --> 02:02:52.565
And so, I'm afraid,
without any ado whatsoever--

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:54.566
Excuse me, my lord.

02:02:55.067 --> 02:02:58.403
Here he is! One of your own!

02:02:59.370 --> 02:03:02.306
Born a stone's throw from
this very stadium...

02:03:02.639 --> 02:03:04.474
...and here before you now.

02:03:04.808 --> 02:03:06.809
The son of John Thatcher...

02:03:07.810 --> 02:03:10.813
...Sir William Thatcher!

02:03:21.922 --> 02:03:23.022
That's your name.

02:03:25.925 --> 02:03:27.926
Sir William Thatcher.

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:30.195
Your father heard that.

02:03:48.309 --> 02:03:49.944
Godspeed, William.

02:05:01.935 --> 02:05:04.704
William!

02:05:25.721 --> 02:05:27.722
You have been weighed.

02:05:29.157 --> 02:05:30.391
You've been measured.

02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:35.729
And you absolutely...

02:05:36.396 --> 02:05:38.064
...have been found wanting.

02:05:42.234 --> 02:05:44.069
Welcome to the new world.

02:05:44.569 --> 02:05:48.072
God save you, if it is right
that he should do so.

02:05:54.710 --> 02:05:56.845
William!

02:06:10.957 --> 02:06:12.625
Yes!

02:06:14.026 --> 02:06:15.694
He's won! He's won!

02:06:50.755 --> 02:06:52.390
You beat him, Will!

02:06:57.060 --> 02:06:58.495
Oh, William.

02:07:19.111 --> 02:07:21.113
I'm going to write this story.

02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:23.381
About the prince and the knights?

02:07:23.615 --> 02:07:28.619
No, all of it. All human activity
lies within the artist's scope.

02:07:31.121 --> 02:07:32.956
Maybe not yours.

02:12:05.841 --> 02:12:06.975
Your round.
