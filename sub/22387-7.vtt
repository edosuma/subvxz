01:55.716 --> 01:57.316
Teller, teller.
Even for professionals, there's

01:57.318 --> 01:59.151
even for professionals, there's
nothing like the thrill of being

01:59.153 --> 02:01.820
nothing like the thrill of being
bamboozled by a great trick.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.860
So we're challenging magicians
to come up with their favorite

02:08.863 --> 02:12.464
to come up with their favorite
tricks and perform them for us.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.599
Tricks and perform them for us.
We'll be in the audience, and

02:13.601 --> 02:15.567
we'll be in the audience, and
we'll watch it live, and only

02:15.569 --> 02:18.203
we'll watch it live, and only
once, just like everyone else.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.671
Once, just like everyone else.
No camera tricks.

here on our stage in Las Vegas.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.483
Here on our stage in Las Vegas.
But be warned.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.252

03:16.864 --> 03:18.797
>> That's the show right there.
And I know they might seem like

03:18.799 --> 03:20.232
and I know they might seem like
a weird combination, but it's an

03:20.234 --> 03:20.866
a weird combination, but it's an
American thing, like peanut

03:20.868 --> 03:22.401
American thing, like peanut
butter and jam, or bacon and

03:22.403 --> 03:22.868
butter and jam, or bacon and
syrup.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.303
Syrup.
It shouldn't work, but it does

03:24.305 --> 03:24.970
it shouldn't work, but it does
brilliantly.

03:24.972 --> 03:25.871

Can I ask?
Are you at all nervous?

03:54.001 --> 03:55.000
Are you at all nervous?
Is there a kind of professional

03:55.002 --> 03:56.368
is there a kind of professional
pride thing at stake here?

03:56.370 --> 03:57.469
Pride thing at stake here?
>> Uh, scared to death.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.704
>> Uh, scared to death.
You know, this seemed like such

03:58.706 --> 03:59.438
you know, this seemed like such
a good idea.

03:59.440 --> 03:59.938
A good idea.
We thought of it.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.740
We thought of it.
And then we walk out here,

04:01.742 --> 04:03.442
and then we walk out here,
and I'm terrified.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.876
And I'm terrified.
I'm so afraid that every single

04:04.878 --> 04:05.911
I'm so afraid that every single
person is gonna fool us.

04:05.913 --> 04:06.979
Person is gonna fool us.
>> Guys, would you like to go

04:06.981 --> 04:07.846
>> guys, would you like to go
and take your seats?

04:07.848 --> 04:08.513
And take your seats?
>> Okay.

04:08.515 --> 04:09.248

Ladies and gentlemen.
[Cheers and applause]

04:17.824 --> 04:21.326
Get comfortable.
So penn and teller will talk

04:21.327 --> 04:22.894
so penn and teller will talk
about how they think the trick

04:22.896 --> 04:24.296
about how they think the trick
has been done but in such a way

04:24.298 --> 04:25.564
has been done but in such a way
that they don't necessarily give

04:25.566 --> 04:26.331
that they don't necessarily give
away the secrets.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.499
Away the secrets.
Obviously, I'm not really

04:27.501 --> 04:28.667
obviously, I'm not really
qualified to judge if they're

04:28.669 --> 04:30.002
qualified to judge if they're
correct, but luckily, upstairs,

04:30.004 --> 04:31.536
correct, but luckily, upstairs,
we have a magician who has spent

04:31.538 --> 04:33.472
we have a magician who has spent
the last 60 years working with

04:33.474 --> 04:35.374
the last 60 years working with
the biggest names in magic,

04:35.376 --> 04:36.541
the biggest names in magic,
helping them work on illusions,

04:36.543 --> 04:37.843
helping them work on illusions,
designing some himself.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.444
Designing some himself.
He's kind of the Simon cowell of

04:39.446 --> 04:40.979
he's kind of the Simon cowell of
sorcery, and his word will be

04:40.981 --> 04:41.847
sorcery, and his word will be
final.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.348

Tamsyn joined the act about
three months ago.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.974
Three months ago.
Since tamsyn has joined us, I've

05:08.976 --> 05:10.909
since tamsyn has joined us, I've
been teaching her how to perform

05:10.911 --> 05:11.810
been teaching her how to perform
the illusions.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.011
The illusions.
I'm just trying to teach her as

Working as a double act can be

05:43.677 --> 05:44.876
working as a double act can be
quite difficult at times.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.345
Quite difficult at times.
You've got to rely on the other

05:46.347 --> 05:47.379
you've got to rely on the other
person, and they've got to rely

05:47.381 --> 05:48.347
person, and they've got to rely
on you.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.548
On you.

it is quite common that two
magicians that work together are

05:50.851 --> 05:52.651
magicians that work together are
a couple, but me and tamsyn

05:52.653 --> 05:55.354

It's gonna be pretty hard to

fool them.

09:28.869 --> 09:29.701
Fool them.

Gonna become a couple?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.675
'Cause that's a horrific idea.
Horrific idea.

10:10.677 --> 10:11.376
Horrific idea.
Teller's got a little something

10:43.110 --> 10:44.275
Drawing you did.
I still don't know how it's

10:44.277 --> 10:45.377
I still don't know how it's
done.

10:45.379 --> 10:46.111
Done.
It's lovely to meet you,

10:46.113 --> 10:46.778
it's lovely to meet you,
Michael and tamsyn.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.113

High jinx, ladies and gentlemen.

High jinx, ladies and gentlemen.
[Applause]

10:53.352 --> 10:56.321
Coming up, we've got more acts

11:21.415 --> 11:22.414
fool penn and teller with their
best trick.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.715
Best trick.
It's time now to meet our next

11:23.717 --> 11:25.717
it's time now to meet our next
performer.

11:30.089 --> 11:32.957
>> My name's jon Allen.
I'm a professional magician and

11:32.959 --> 11:36.161
I'm a professional magician and
creator of magical effects.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.896
Creator of magical effects.
The style of magic I do is

11:37.898 --> 11:39.397
the style of magic I do is
close-up magic, mainly.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.032
Close-up magic, mainly.
I always try to do magic with

11:41.034 --> 11:42.867
I always try to do magic with
everyday objects and things that

11:42.869 --> 11:45.403
everyday objects and things that
people can relate to.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.971
People can relate to.
The trick I'm gonna be doing

11:46.973 --> 11:48.907
the trick I'm gonna be doing
tonight is very dangerous.

11:48.909 --> 11:49.874
Tonight is very dangerous.
I don't think anyone has died

11:49.876 --> 11:52.077
I don't think anyone has died
yet from doing it, but it has

11:52.079 --> 11:53.078
yet from doing it, but it has
caused a lot of injuries, and

11:53.080 --> 11:55.113
caused a lot of injuries, and
hopefully, I won't be added to

11:55.115 --> 11:58.383
hopefully, I won't be added to
that list.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.318
That list.
The sort of reactions I get when

12:00.320 --> 12:02.020
the sort of reactions I get when
I perform this, I've had people

12:02.022 --> 12:03.288
I perform this, I've had people
screaming, people just not

12:03.290 --> 12:05.790
screaming, people just not
wanting to look, and some people

12:05.792 --> 12:08.059
wanting to look, and some people
wondering if I'm actually a sane

12:08.061 --> 12:09.060
wondering if I'm actually a sane
human being.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.062
Human being.
That I never let on.

12:16.235 --> 12:21.906
>> Now, the trick you are about
to see is definitely risky.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.374
To see is definitely risky.
If it goes well, if it works,

12:23.376 --> 12:24.743
if it goes well, if it works,
our next performer could be

12:24.745 --> 12:25.443
our next performer could be
going to Vegas.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.378
Going to Vegas.
If it goes badly, he will be

12:27.380 --> 12:28.980
if it goes badly, he will be
going to casualty and then

12:28.982 --> 12:30.949
going to casualty and then
almost straight on to YouTube.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.083
Almost straight on to YouTube.
Will you please welcome

12:32.085 --> 12:33.885
will you please welcome
Mr. jon Allen?

12:33.887 --> 12:36.888
Mr. jon Allen?
[Applause]

12:43.062 --> 12:45.396
>> Thank you very much.
Thank you.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.998
Thank you.
Are we in control of our own

12:47.000 --> 12:48.066
are we in control of our own
fate?

12:48.068 --> 12:49.200
Fate?
Clearly, for me tonight, the

12:49.202 --> 12:52.771
clearly, for me tonight, the
answer to that question is no.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.773
Answer to that question is no.
But are any of us in control of

12:54.775 --> 12:55.540
but are any of us in control of
our own fate?

12:55.542 --> 12:57.842
Our own fate?
Because every single day, we

12:57.844 --> 13:00.044
because every single day, we
rely on other people for our own

13:00.046 --> 13:01.980
rely on other people for our own
safety, whether it's other

13:01.982 --> 13:03.948
safety, whether it's other
drivers on the road, the chef

13:03.950 --> 13:05.049
drivers on the road, the chef
who cooks our food in the

13:05.051 --> 13:07.152
who cooks our food in the
restaurant, or even the person

13:07.154 --> 13:09.120
restaurant, or even the person
who secured the studio lights to

13:09.122 --> 13:12.023
who secured the studio lights to
the ceiling above your heads.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.358
The ceiling above your heads.
So let me explain what I have

13:13.360 --> 13:14.893
so let me explain what I have
here.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.928
Here.
Inside the first three bags,

13:16.930 --> 13:18.997
inside the first three bags,
I have a block of wood.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.298
I have a block of wood.
Now, the reason for the block of

13:20.300 --> 13:23.368
now, the reason for the block of
wood will be become apparent in

13:23.370 --> 13:25.503
wood will be become apparent in
a few moments.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.472
A few moments.
In the fourth bag, there is

13:27.474 --> 13:28.907
in the fourth bag, there is
another block of wood, but as

13:28.909 --> 13:30.809
another block of wood, but as
you can see, I've drilled a hole

13:30.811 --> 13:31.509
you can see, I've drilled a hole
through it.

13:31.511 --> 13:35.246
Through it.
The reason for that is this,

13:35.248 --> 13:38.349
the reason for that is this,
a solid 6-inch stainless steel

13:38.351 --> 13:39.584
a solid 6-inch stainless steel
spike.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.252
Spike.
Technically, it's a nail, but I

13:41.254 --> 13:43.555
technically, it's a nail, but I
do like alliteration.

13:43.557 --> 13:44.956
Do like alliteration.
Now, I need someone to verify

13:44.958 --> 13:47.192
now, I need someone to verify
that this is in fact sharp, so

13:47.194 --> 13:49.060
that this is in fact sharp, so
the lady just on the end there,

13:49.062 --> 13:49.828
the lady just on the end there,
your name is...

13:49.830 --> 13:50.361
Your name is...
>> Sophia.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.196
>> Sophia.
>> Sophia, can you come up and

13:51.197 --> 13:52.030
>> Sophia, can you come up and
join me, please?

13:52.032 --> 13:53.198
Join me, please?
Give her a round of applause.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.835
Give her a round of applause.
[Applause]

13:56.837 --> 13:57.602
[Applause]
I'd like to thank you coming to

13:57.604 --> 13:59.604
I'd like to thank you coming to
help, thank you.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.172
Help, thank you.
Could you just slam--actually,

14:01.174 --> 14:01.906
could you just slam--actually,
don't slam your hand down.

14:01.907 --> 14:02.639
Don't slam your hand down.
That would be quite silly.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.372
That would be quite silly.
Can you just tap the palm of

14:03.376 --> 14:04.192
can you just tap the palm of
your hand just on there very

14:04.193 --> 14:05.009
your hand just on there very
gently?

14:05.011 --> 14:06.244
Gently?
Is that--is that sharp?

14:06.246 --> 14:07.111
Is that--is that sharp?
>> Yeah.

14:07.113 --> 14:07.579
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, good.

14:07.581 --> 14:10.849
>> Yeah, good.
Now the nail goes into the bag,

14:10.851 --> 14:11.316
now the nail goes into the bag,
yeah?

14:11.318 --> 14:12.183
Yeah?
Happy?

14:12.185 --> 14:12.851
Happy?
>> Yeah.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.152
>> Yeah.
>> Good.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.989
>> Good.
Now I need to mix up the bags

14:17.991 --> 14:20.225
now I need to mix up the bags
so that nobody knows where the

14:20.227 --> 14:21.893
so that nobody knows where the
nail is.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.628
Nail is.
But so that you don't know,

14:23.630 --> 14:26.464
but so that you don't know,
I have this screen.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.599
I have this screen.
Now, Sophia, could you just turn

14:27.601 --> 14:28.867
now, Sophia, could you just turn
around so that you can't see

14:28.869 --> 14:29.334
around so that you can't see
either?

14:29.336 --> 14:30.201
Either?
That's fine.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.069
That's fine.
Now I'm just gonna mix up the

14:31.071 --> 14:33.471
now I'm just gonna mix up the
bags so that none of you know

14:33.473 --> 14:35.206
bags so that none of you know
where the nail is.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.407
Where the nail is.
But I know what you're thinking.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.142
But I know what you're thinking.
I don't expect that to fool you.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.177
I don't expect that to fool you.
Well, that's why I'm going to

14:39.179 --> 14:41.012
well, that's why I'm going to
have Sophia mix up the bags as

14:41.014 --> 14:41.479
have Sophia mix up the bags as
well.

14:41.481 --> 14:42.781
Well.
Sophia, can you just turn

14:42.782 --> 14:44.082
Sophia, can you just turn
around, and can you just mix up

14:44.084 --> 14:45.049
around, and can you just mix up
the bags for me?

14:45.051 --> 14:47.018
The bags for me?
Just a few times and just leave

14:47.020 --> 14:48.219
just a few times and just leave
them in a straight line.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.454
Them in a straight line.
And now you can see why I have

14:49.456 --> 14:51.389
and now you can see why I have
the extra blocks, otherwise it's

14:51.391 --> 14:52.457
the extra blocks, otherwise it's
quite easy to see which are the

14:52.459 --> 14:54.459
quite easy to see which are the
empty bags.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.159
Empty bags.
Have you done that?

14:55.161 --> 14:56.027
Have you done that?
>> Yeah.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.195
>> Yeah.
>> Fantastic.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.429
>> Fantastic.
Great.

14:58.431 --> 15:02.000
Great.
Let's take this away.

15:02.002 --> 15:06.137
Let's take this away.
So tonight, I'm gonna put my

15:06.139 --> 15:08.273
so tonight, I'm gonna put my
safety into the hands of

15:08.275 --> 15:12.243
safety into the hands of
somebody else...You.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.245
Somebody else...You.
It's time to get serious because

15:14.247 --> 15:16.247
it's time to get serious because
there are videos online of

15:16.249 --> 15:18.349
there are videos online of
people doing this type of effect

15:18.351 --> 15:20.218
people doing this type of effect
and getting it wrong and badly

15:20.220 --> 15:21.552
and getting it wrong and badly
injuring themselves.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.988
Injuring themselves.
And because of that, I have to

15:23.990 --> 15:25.173
and because of that, I have to
say a couple of things.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.357
Say a couple of things.
First of all, check out the

15:26.359 --> 15:27.425
first of all, check out the
videos because some of them are

15:27.427 --> 15:28.159
videos because some of them are
quite funny.

15:28.161 --> 15:31.663
Quite funny.
But also, please do not try this

15:31.665 --> 15:33.298
but also, please do not try this
at home.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.233
At home.
And for legal reasons, I have to

15:35.235 --> 15:37.435
and for legal reasons, I have to
say in front of everybody here,

15:37.437 --> 15:40.305
say in front of everybody here,
if this goes wrong and I end up

15:40.307 --> 15:43.207
if this goes wrong and I end up
getting injured, the fault lies

15:43.209 --> 15:48.179
getting injured, the fault lies
entirely with Sophia.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.981
Entirely with Sophia.
Sophia, I'm going to pass my

15:49.983 --> 15:52.317
Sophia, I'm going to pass my
hand over each bag.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.018
Hand over each bag.
When you get a sense or a

15:54.020 --> 15:56.287
when you get a sense or a
feeling that my hand is over a

15:56.289 --> 15:59.390
feeling that my hand is over a
safe bag--that's one, well,

15:59.392 --> 16:02.460
safe bag--that's one, well,
without the nail in--I'd like

16:02.462 --> 16:06.364
without the nail in--I'd like
you just to say, "stop."

16:06.366 --> 16:07.231
You just to say, "stop."
>> Stop.

16:07.233 --> 16:10.301
>> Stop.
>> This one here, you sure?

16:10.303 --> 16:14.205
>> This one here, you sure?
Mm-kay.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.039
Mm-kay.
Suddenly, this seems like a

16:15.041 --> 16:16.541
suddenly, this seems like a
really stupid thing to do.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.543
Really stupid thing to do.
>> [Laughs]

16:21.747 --> 16:23.748
>> One down.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.290
Literally, one down.
All right.

16:32.292 --> 16:32.757
All right.
Two more to go.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.159
Two more to go.
Sophia, the same thing.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.394
Sophia, the same thing.
When you think my hand is over a

16:36.396 --> 16:40.198
when you think my hand is over a
safe bag, just say, "stop."

16:40.200 --> 16:41.332
Safe bag, just say, "stop."
>> Stop.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.100
>> Stop.
>> In this one?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.534
>> In this one?
Okay.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.337
Okay.
Maybe there are times when you

16:46.339 --> 16:47.638
maybe there are times when you
are in control of your own fate,

16:47.640 --> 16:49.374
are in control of your own fate,
and maybe tonight is just such

16:49.376 --> 16:52.343
and maybe tonight is just such
a moment for you, Sophia.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.277
A moment for you, Sophia.
Could you take maybe two steps

16:53.279 --> 16:54.178
could you take maybe two steps
to your right?

16:54.180 --> 16:55.179
To your right?
Are you left or right-handed?

16:55.181 --> 16:55.680
Are you left or right-handed?
>> Right.

16:55.682 --> 16:59.317
>> Right.
>> That's a shame, okay.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.184
>> That's a shame, okay.
You're going with your

17:00.186 --> 17:00.651
you're going with your
instincts.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.486
Instincts.
>> Mm-hmm.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.288
>> Mm-hmm.
>> All right, just let--

17:04.290 --> 17:05.790
>> all right, just let--
just let your arm go loose.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.125
Just let your arm go loose.
Okay.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.159
Okay.
We'll do this on a count of--

17:08.161 --> 17:10.028
we'll do this on a count of--
just let it go loose.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.162
Just let it go loose.
Expands the muscles just in

17:11.164 --> 17:12.463
expands the muscles just in
case.

17:12.464 --> 17:16.334
Case.
On the count of one.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.268
On the count of one.
You okay?

17:17.270 --> 17:18.803
You okay?
Thank you.

17:22.307 --> 17:25.443
Sophia, I promise that I will do
this one.

17:25.444 --> 17:26.310
This one.
>> Okay.

17:26.311 --> 17:27.612
>> Okay.
>> All right.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.348
>> All right.
For the final time, when you

17:30.350 --> 17:32.050
for the final time, when you
think my hand is over the safe

17:32.052 --> 17:36.187
think my hand is over the safe
bag, you get that gut feeling,

17:36.189 --> 17:39.424
bag, you get that gut feeling,
just say, "stop."

17:39.426 --> 17:41.125
Just say, "stop."
>> Stop.

17:41.127 --> 17:41.692
>> Stop.
>> That's it?

17:41.694 --> 17:42.360
>> That's it?
>> Mm-hmm.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.294
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Okay.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.429
>> Okay.
[Inhales]

17:44.431 --> 17:46.230
[Inhales]
>> [Laughs]

17:48.434 --> 17:50.234
>> How do I do this?

17:55.407 --> 18:01.312
Sorry.
Yes!

18:01.314 --> 18:03.347
Yes!
Thank you very much indeed.

18:03.349 --> 18:06.350
Thank you very much indeed.
[Applause]

18:16.428 --> 18:19.297
Thank you.
>> Mr. jon Allen,

18:19.299 --> 18:20.364
>> Mr. jon Allen,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.432
Ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Sophia.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.333
Thank you, Sophia.
Nice job as well.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.568
Nice job as well.
Jon, that was tremendous.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.469
Jon, that was tremendous.
Let's go around to the front

18:24.471 --> 18:25.336
let's go around to the front
here.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.204
Here.
That was fabulous.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.371
That was fabulous.
It was nerve-racking, and it was

18:27.373 --> 18:28.306
it was nerve-racking, and it was
funny at times as well.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.374
Funny at times as well.
And poor Sophia almost fainted,

18:30.376 --> 18:31.642
and poor Sophia almost fainted,
I think, at one time.

18:31.644 --> 18:32.677
I think, at one time.
And you're right.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.112
And you're right.
I have seen these clips on

18:34.114 --> 18:34.579
I have seen these clips on
YouTube.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.813
YouTube.
There are instances of people

18:35.815 --> 18:37.782
there are instances of people
actually doing this and actually

18:37.784 --> 18:39.450
actually doing this and actually
getting impaled.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.318
Getting impaled.
>> Yep.

18:40.320 --> 18:40.785
>> Yep.
>> I mean, for real.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.603
>> I mean, for real.
I've seen these things.

18:41.604 --> 18:42.420
I've seen these things.
I don't know if they do it the

18:42.422 --> 18:42.887
I don't know if they do it the
same way as you.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.322
Same way as you.
I don't know why that happened

18:44.324 --> 18:45.156
I don't know why that happened
and how that happened, but has

18:45.158 --> 18:46.257
and how that happened, but has
it every gone wrong or nearly

18:46.259 --> 18:46.724
it every gone wrong or nearly
wrong for you?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.192
Wrong for you?
It hasn't gone wrong yet, but as

18:48.194 --> 18:49.160
it hasn't gone wrong yet, but as
I said, there's always that

18:49.162 --> 18:51.629
I said, there's always that
inherent risk of something going

18:51.631 --> 18:52.497
inherent risk of something going
wrong.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.197
Wrong.
>> Yeah, yeah.

18:53.199 --> 18:53.865
>> Yeah, yeah.
And when you do it--when you had

18:53.867 --> 18:55.299
and when you do it--when you had
Sophia's hand, and you pushed

18:55.301 --> 18:56.534
Sophia's hand, and you pushed
that on there, is there a moment

18:56.536 --> 18:58.703
that on there, is there a moment
where you think, "I might have

18:58.705 --> 18:59.470
where you think, "I might have
got this wrong.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.338
Got this wrong.
I'm beef.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.906
I'm beef.
Thank God it isn't my hand"?

19:01.908 --> 19:03.441
Thank God it isn't my hand"?
>> I prefer just to use

19:03.443 --> 19:05.776
>> I prefer just to use
someone's hand for all of it.

19:05.778 --> 19:06.711
Someone's hand for all of it.
That's the easiest way out of

19:06.713 --> 19:07.645
that's the easiest way out of
it.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.347
It.
But no, I do--I do worry for the

19:09.349 --> 19:11.349
but no, I do--I do worry for the
person, and thank you for doing

19:11.351 --> 19:12.216
person, and thank you for doing
something you didn't know your

19:12.218 --> 19:12.850
something you didn't know your
were gonna do, so I appreciate

19:12.852 --> 19:13.518
were gonna do, so I appreciate
that.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.352
That.
>> And can I just ask?

19:14.354 --> 19:15.419
>> And can I just ask?
Have you performed in Vegas

19:15.421 --> 19:15.887
have you performed in Vegas
before?

19:15.889 --> 19:16.754
Before?
Have you visited Vegas before?

19:16.756 --> 19:18.573
Have you visited Vegas before?
Have you done shows over there?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.391
Have you done shows over there?
>> I'd love to go to Vegas.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.459
>> I'd love to go to Vegas.
>> Well, you haven't gone there

19:21.461 --> 19:21.926
>> well, you haven't gone there
yet.

19:21.928 --> 19:22.827
Yet.
Okay, well penn and teller still

19:22.829 --> 19:23.494
okay, well penn and teller still
talking.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.395
Talking.
I think--do you think I've given

19:24.397 --> 19:25.396
I think--do you think I've given
them long enough, ladies and

19:25.398 --> 19:25.863
them long enough, ladies and
gentlemen?

19:25.865 --> 19:26.531
Gentlemen?
>> Yes.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.398
>> Yes.
>> I think I have.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.233
>> I think I have.
'Cause what they have to do, of

19:28.234 --> 19:29.067
'cause what they have to do, of
course, is get it right.

19:29.068 --> 19:29.901
Course, is get it right.
They can't just give me three

19:29.903 --> 19:30.701
they can't just give me three
possibilities.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.469
Possibilities.
They can't give me two

19:31.470 --> 19:32.236
they can't give me two
possibilities.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.271
Possibilities.
I'm gonna make them settle on

19:33.273 --> 19:33.938
I'm gonna make them settle on
one, and that's what I'm gonna

19:33.940 --> 19:34.605
one, and that's what I'm gonna
do right now.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.473
Do right now.
Penn?

19:35.475 --> 19:35.940
Penn?
Teller?

19:35.942 --> 19:37.308
Teller?
Hello?

19:37.310 --> 19:39.410
Hello?
How can you just ignore me?

19:39.412 --> 19:40.811
How can you just ignore me?
Okay, Mr. penn?

19:40.813 --> 19:41.946
Okay, Mr. penn?
>> First of all, I want to

19:41.948 --> 19:43.447
>> first of all, I want to
address a moral issue.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.816
Address a moral issue.
What you said about the videos

19:45.818 --> 19:49.187
what you said about the videos
on YouTube is absolutely true.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.488
On YouTube is absolutely true.
There are people that have done

19:50.490 --> 19:52.390
there are people that have done
tricks similar to this who have

19:52.392 --> 19:53.491
tricks similar to this who have
been injured doing it, and I

19:53.493 --> 19:55.426
been injured doing it, and I
want to just state very

19:55.428 --> 19:57.562
want to just state very
strongly, the magicians that do

19:57.564 --> 20:00.498
strongly, the magicians that do
things that are truly dangerous

20:00.500 --> 20:01.666
things that are truly dangerous
are immoral.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.634
Are immoral.
That's wrong to do, and I'm

20:03.636 --> 20:05.503
that's wrong to do, and I'm
hoping that the producers would

20:05.505 --> 20:06.938
hoping that the producers would
never allow this on this show,

20:06.940 --> 20:08.839
never allow this on this show,
and I believe they would not.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.942
And I believe they would not.
That having been said, we don't

20:10.944 --> 20:12.376
that having been said, we don't
think there's any chance

20:12.378 --> 20:14.545
think there's any chance
involved in this whatsoever.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.780
Involved in this whatsoever.
Teller was expecting through the

20:15.782 --> 20:18.583
teller was expecting through the
whole trick that you had nails

20:18.585 --> 20:20.484
whole trick that you had nails
in all four bags and you were

20:20.486 --> 20:21.552
in all four bags and you were
going to pull it up from the

20:21.554 --> 20:22.820
going to pull it up from the
bottom and hook it up from

20:22.822 --> 20:23.487
bottom and hook it up from
there.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.355
There.
You didn't do that.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.489
You didn't do that.
I believe, and I could be

20:25.491 --> 20:28.326
I believe, and I could be
wrong, that I saw after you did

20:28.328 --> 20:31.462
wrong, that I saw after you did
the kind of faux praying gesture

20:31.464 --> 20:34.532
the kind of faux praying gesture
on the last bag and came down, I

20:34.534 --> 20:37.401
on the last bag and came down, I
believe your right hand went out

20:37.403 --> 20:39.370
believe your right hand went out
of sight, and I believe you

20:39.372 --> 20:41.405
of sight, and I believe you
caught the prop to load it into

20:41.407 --> 20:42.640
caught the prop to load it into
the final bag.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.542
The final bag.
>> Is that right, or is that

20:44.544 --> 20:45.409
>> is that right, or is that
wrong?

20:45.411 --> 20:46.477
Wrong?
Because if that's right,

20:46.479 --> 20:47.345
because if that's right,
you didn't fool them.

20:47.347 --> 20:47.812
You didn't fool them.
>> Yep.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.714
>> Yep.
>> If that's wrong, you're going

20:49.716 --> 20:51.515
>> if that's wrong, you're going
to Vegas.

20:51.517 --> 20:52.617
To Vegas.
>> Much as I'd love to go to

20:52.619 --> 20:55.319
>> much as I'd love to go to
Vegas, that's close enough for

20:55.321 --> 20:57.455
Vegas, that's close enough for
me that you got it.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.522
Me that you got it.
>> Well, well, thank you.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.324
>> Well, well, thank you.
>> Wow.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.592
>> Wow.
Jon Allen, ladies and gentlemen.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.861
Jon Allen, ladies and gentlemen.
Great job.

21:03.863 --> 21:04.862
Great job.
It's time for a bit more modern

21:04.864 --> 21:05.529
it's time for a bit more modern
magic.

21:05.531 --> 21:06.397
Magic.
It's a trick called the

21:06.399 --> 21:06.864
it's a trick called the
commercial break.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.466
Commercial break.
See you in a couple of minutes.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.468
See you in a couple of minutes.
[Applause]

21:22.314 --> 21:25.583
>> Thank you, and welcome back
to <i> fool us,</i> where we challenge

21:25.585 --> 21:27.718
to <i> fool us,</i> where we challenge
magicians to try and battle penn

21:27.720 --> 21:28.853
magicians to try and battle penn
and teller with their killer

21:28.855 --> 21:30.354
and teller with their killer
trick to win a dream performance

21:30.356 --> 21:30.921
trick to win a dream performance
in Las Vegas.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.723
In Las Vegas.
Now you know all the rules, so

21:32.725 --> 21:34.725
now you know all the rules, so
let's meet the next challenger.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.397
>> Oh, yeah.
Hello, my name is Graham jolley.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.298
Hello, my name is Graham jolley.
I'm probably one of the world's

21:40.300 --> 21:42.300
I'm probably one of the world's
oldest mind readers or

21:42.302 --> 21:42.867
oldest mind readers or
mentalists.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.335
Mentalists.
Yep, bloody marvelous.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.036
Yep, bloody marvelous.
You're probably wondering what

21:45.038 --> 21:46.070
you're probably wondering what
the word "mentalist" is.

21:46.072 --> 21:46.937
The word "mentalist" is.
Well, it's different from a

21:46.939 --> 21:48.873
well, it's different from a
magician, although we all come

21:48.875 --> 21:49.707
magician, although we all come
from the same background.

21:49.709 --> 21:50.541
From the same background.
Four.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.075
Four.
It is four.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.643
It is four.
But when I got to about 15,

21:52.645 --> 21:53.944
but when I got to about 15,
I thought it was rather childish

21:53.946 --> 21:54.945
I thought it was rather childish
doing this sort of thing.

21:54.946 --> 21:55.945
Doing this sort of thing.
It doesn't feel right, you know,

21:55.948 --> 21:57.948
it doesn't feel right, you know,
and so, I stopped.

21:57.950 --> 21:58.616
And so, I stopped.
Hello, ladies.

21:58.618 --> 21:59.083
Hello, ladies.
Thank you.

21:59.085 --> 21:59.950
Thank you.
Would you help me?

21:59.952 --> 22:00.951
Would you help me?
I've been doing this now for

22:00.953 --> 22:02.753
I've been doing this now for
about 40 years, I think.

22:02.755 --> 22:03.788
About 40 years, I think.
Two of those years have been

22:03.790 --> 22:04.488
two of those years have been
successful.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.523
Successful.
The rest, well, it's been

22:05.525 --> 22:07.958
the rest, well, it's been
downhill, really.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.460
Downhill, really.
I used to be the world's fastest

22:09.462 --> 22:11.329
I used to be the world's fastest
mind reader, but now I'm sort of

22:11.331 --> 22:11.829
mind reader, but now I'm sort of
slowed down, rather.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.431
Slowed down, rather.
I've now become one of the

22:13.433 --> 22:14.365
I've now become one of the
oldest mind readers in the

22:14.367 --> 22:15.099
oldest mind readers in the
country.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.567
Country.
I'm nearly 66 now, and people

22:16.569 --> 22:18.569
I'm nearly 66 now, and people
think I should pack up, retire,

22:18.571 --> 22:19.570
think I should pack up, retire,
and spend more time with the

22:19.572 --> 22:20.037
and spend more time with the
family.

22:20.039 --> 22:20.905
Family.
Thank you.

22:20.907 --> 22:21.572
Thank you.
I don't want to.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.441
I don't want to.
Have you seen my wife?

22:23.443 --> 22:24.842
Have you seen my wife?
The problem is I've got to fool

22:24.844 --> 22:25.609
the problem is I've got to fool
penn and teller.

22:25.611 --> 22:26.744
Penn and teller.
I've got to do something in

22:26.746 --> 22:27.712
I've got to do something in
which penn and teller couldn't

22:27.714 --> 22:29.647
which penn and teller couldn't
even be bothered to try and work

22:29.649 --> 22:30.614
even be bothered to try and work
it out.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.083
It out.
In that way, I can sort of

22:32.085 --> 22:33.484
in that way, I can sort of
short-circuit their thinking

22:33.486 --> 22:34.518
short-circuit their thinking
process, I hope.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.019
Process, I hope.
[Hums]

22:35.021 --> 22:36.053

And hold it against you.
Would you now, gentlemen, both

23:44.190 --> 23:46.490

look at and remember your cards?

23:46.492 --> 23:47.525
Look at and remember your cards?
Would you just drop yours back,

23:47.527 --> 23:48.559

And teller.

23:49.061 --> 23:49.927
And teller.
>> It's hard.

23:49.929 --> 23:50.761

A long reach and I'm huge.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.429
A long reach and I'm huge.
>> It's a long stretch.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.096

Just drop yours back.

Just drop yours back.
Teller, I hope you don't think

23:53.199 --> 23:55.166
teller, I hope you don't think
I'm rude, but is it okay to

23:55.168 --> 23:55.833
I'm rude, but is it okay to
call you teller?

23:55.835 --> 23:57.168
Call you teller?
It seems awfully familiar.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.102
It seems awfully familiar.
It's okay.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.069
It's okay.
Okay.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.070
Okay.
What I'm trying to do is a

24:00.072 --> 24:01.038
what I'm trying to do is a
little bit of misdirection

24:01.040 --> 24:01.705
little bit of misdirection
there.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.474
There.
I was trying to distract teller

24:03.476 --> 24:05.142
I was trying to distract teller
to look away from my hands,

24:05.144 --> 24:07.144
to look away from my hands,
but it didn't work.

24:11.183 --> 24:15.453
I find it quite irritating,
actually.

24:15.455 --> 24:16.687
Actually.
I don't like your attitude.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.622
I don't like your attitude.
No, no.

24:18.624 --> 24:19.924
No, no.
I'm only joking.

24:19.926 --> 24:20.658
I'm only joking.
Forgive me.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.092
Forgive me.
I've reversed two cards in the

24:22.094 --> 24:22.760
I've reversed two cards in the
pack.

24:22.762 --> 24:23.694
Pack.
The jokers.

24:23.696 --> 24:24.695
The jokers.
Were they your cards?

24:24.697 --> 24:25.596
Were they your cards?
Did either of you choose the

24:25.598 --> 24:27.031
did either of you choose the
joker?

24:27.033 --> 24:27.932
Joker?
>> I did not.

24:27.934 --> 24:28.999
>> I did not.
>> No, okay, okay, because the

24:29.001 --> 24:31.735
>> no, okay, okay, because the
jokers will tell me where your

24:31.737 --> 24:32.837
jokers will tell me where your
cards are.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.238
Cards are.
To be quite honest, ladies and

24:34.240 --> 24:35.139
to be quite honest, ladies and
gentlemen, I don't know how this

24:35.141 --> 24:35.806
gentlemen, I don't know how this
is possible.

24:35.808 --> 24:36.974
Is possible.
I don't know the cards penn and

24:36.976 --> 24:38.042
I don't know the cards penn and
teller cut to.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.043
Teller cut to.
I obviously wouldn't know where

24:39.045 --> 24:40.511
I obviously wouldn't know where
they are, but they do.

24:40.513 --> 24:42.246
They are, but they do.
They talk to me.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.747
They talk to me.
You'll find this interesting.

24:43.749 --> 24:45.483
You'll find this interesting.
And, um...

24:45.485 --> 24:49.787
And, um...
[Laughter]

24:49.789 --> 24:51.489
[Laughter]
They will tell me where the two

24:51.491 --> 24:52.156
they will tell me where the two
cards are.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.891
Cards are.
Hello?

24:53.893 --> 24:56.260
Hello?
Can you speak clearly, please?

24:56.262 --> 24:59.830
Can you speak clearly, please?
It's not channel four, and, um,

24:59.832 --> 25:00.798
it's not channel four, and, um,
it's where?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.666
It's where?
The 18th card from the top?

25:02.668 --> 25:04.768
The 18th card from the top?
Thank you so much.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.604
Thank you so much.
And teller's joker will tell me

25:06.606 --> 25:09.139
and teller's joker will tell me
where your card is.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.140
Where your card is.
Ah, that's clearer.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.243
Ah, that's clearer.
43rd.

25:12.245 --> 25:13.010
43rd.
Okay.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.512
Okay.
The jokers tell me that the two

25:14.514 --> 25:18.115
the jokers tell me that the two
cards are the 18th and 43rd card

25:18.117 --> 25:18.916
cards are the 18th and 43rd card
from the top of the pack.

25:18.918 --> 25:19.950
From the top of the pack.
I'm sorry, I'm going to do this

25:19.952 --> 25:20.618
I'm sorry, I'm going to do this
fairly quickly.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.252
Fairly quickly.
I know it's dull.

25:21.254 --> 25:22.286
I know it's dull.
I'm just going to count down to

25:22.288 --> 25:23.120
I'm just going to count down to
the 18th card.

25:23.122 --> 25:27.091

I never forget, ladies and

25:32.865 --> 25:34.965
I never forget, ladies and
gentlemen, what sigourney Weaver

25:34.967 --> 25:36.233
gentlemen, what sigourney Weaver
once said to me.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.235
Once said to me.
She said, "who are you?"

25:41.273 --> 25:42.806
I'm trying to make this
entertaining.

25:42.808 --> 25:45.910
Entertaining.
And, um...

The king of spades.
[Applause]

26:22.914 --> 26:24.949
Teller.
Teller, you better just nod.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.850
Teller, you better just nod.
Was your card the five of

I know what you're thinking,
ladies and gentlemen.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.133
Ladies and gentlemen.
You're thinking this is quite a

26:43.135 --> 26:44.935
you're thinking this is quite a
lot of procedure for what is

26:44.937 --> 26:48.973
lot of procedure for what is
really a very minor miracle.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.375
Really a very minor miracle.
Obviously, the jokers don't talk

26:51.377 --> 26:54.612
obviously, the jokers don't talk
to me, but the jokers do have

26:54.614 --> 26:57.314
to me, but the jokers do have
the power of prediction because

26:57.316 --> 27:00.384
the power of prediction because
before the show, penn's joker

27:00.386 --> 27:04.088
before the show, penn's joker
predicted 18 and teller's joker

27:04.090 --> 27:07.291
predicted 18 and teller's joker
predicted the 43rd position.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.327
Predicted the 43rd position.

I can't work it out.
But the audience's reaction when

but the audience's reaction when
you pulled some of those last,

27:38.391 --> 27:39.256
you pulled some of those last,
they were looking at each other

27:39.258 --> 27:40.090
they were looking at each other
completely dumbfounded.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.191
Completely dumbfounded.
That must be a lovely--

>> they looked genuinely
mystified to me.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.030
Mystified to me.
If they get all it down,

if they get all it down,
we've had a great show.

27:47.032 --> 27:48.031

They're still chatting about it.
Mr. penn, Mr. teller?

27:56.876 --> 27:58.676
Mr. penn, Mr. teller?
Just ignoring me won't make it

28:15.461 --> 28:17.961
Things it's not.
You did not do a card force.

28:17.963 --> 28:20.197
You did not do a card force.
We had a real choice of the

28:20.199 --> 28:21.165
we had a real choice of the
card.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.099
Card.
Could we look at that deck

28:22.101 --> 28:22.800
could we look at that deck
now?

28:22.802 --> 28:23.467
Now?
>> Yes.

28:23.469 --> 28:24.134
>> Yes.
>> We could?

28:24.136 --> 28:25.753
>> We could?
We could look at the deck?

28:25.754 --> 28:27.371
We could look at the deck?
>> I haven't given you a clue.

28:27.373 --> 28:30.908
>> I haven't given you a clue.
>> So, um, there was not, as you

28:30.910 --> 28:33.377
>> so, um, there was not, as you
can see, this is a--as far as I

28:33.379 --> 28:34.344
can see, this is a--as far as I
can tell--

28:34.346 --> 28:35.913
can tell--
>> I haven't eaten.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.448
>> I haven't eaten.
>> This is a, uh...

28:37.450 --> 28:39.383
>> This is a, uh...
This is a regular deck of cards.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.018
This is a regular deck of cards.
There's not a bank.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.853
There's not a bank.
You could have had a bank of

28:42.855 --> 28:45.322
you could have had a bank of
king of spades a third of the

28:45.324 --> 28:45.989
king of spades a third of the
way down.

28:45.991 --> 28:46.957
Way down.
>> I was gonna use that method,

28:46.959 --> 28:47.424
>> I was gonna use that method,
actually.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.292
Actually.
>> But you didn't.

28:48.294 --> 28:48.959
>> But you didn't.
>> Gosh, good.

28:48.961 --> 28:49.426

28:49.428 --> 28:50.928
>> But you didn't.

>> I get the feeling, are you
just fishing here or do you know

28:52.331 --> 28:53.197
just fishing here or do you know
what--are you going somewhere

28:53.199 --> 28:53.864
what--are you going somewhere
with this?

28:53.866 --> 28:54.465
With this?
>> I'm telling you what it

28:54.467 --> 28:55.899
>> I'm telling you what it
couldn't be.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.167
Couldn't be.
I'm building him up.

28:57.169 --> 28:57.901
I'm building him up.
>> Are you?

28:57.903 --> 28:58.836
>> Are you?
>> Because it's so great.

28:58.838 --> 28:59.503
>> Because it's so great.
>> Okay.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.904
>> Okay.
>> So I think by doing all of

29:00.906 --> 29:03.373
>> so I think by doing all of
that with no force and no deck

29:03.375 --> 29:04.842
that with no force and no deck
switch, you might know what

29:04.844 --> 29:06.176
switch, you might know what
my next words are gonna be.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.412
My next words are gonna be.

Performing to penn and teller is

30:39.205 --> 30:40.404
performing to penn and teller is
gonna be nerve-racking.

30:40.406 --> 30:41.972
Gonna be nerve-racking.
These guys are gonna be very

30:41.974 --> 30:42.973

difficult to impress.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.141

than I've been alive.

30:45.578 --> 30:47.044

33:42.287 --> 33:43.153
>> I've never seen anything like
that.

33:43.155 --> 33:43.787
That.
I don't know whether penn and

33:43.789 --> 33:44.454
I don't know whether penn and
teller have.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.288
Teller have.
I'm looking for a device like

33:45.290 --> 33:46.356
I'm looking for a device like
that after Christmas to help me

33:46.358 --> 33:47.357
that after Christmas to help me
get a little bit smaller.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.525
Get a little bit smaller.
I don't know whether it would

33:48.527 --> 33:49.760
I don't know whether it would
work in quite that way, but I

33:49.762 --> 33:51.128
work in quite that way, but I
guess you can't put on weight if

33:51.130 --> 33:51.595
guess you can't put on weight if
you're gonna--

33:51.597 --> 33:52.262
you're gonna--
>> that's right.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.296
>> That's right.
As long as you get in there, you

33:53.298 --> 33:54.131
as long as you get in there, you
know, you keep in good shape.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.298
Know, you keep in good shape.
>> So now how confident do you

33:55.300 --> 33:56.033
>> so now how confident do you
feel?

33:56.035 --> 33:56.767
Feel?
Obviously, it must be

33:56.768 --> 33:57.500
obviously, it must be
nerve-racking performing anyway,

33:57.503 --> 33:59.069
nerve-racking performing anyway,
but performing in front of penn

33:59.071 --> 34:00.337
but performing in front of penn
and teller makes it doubly so.

34:00.339 --> 34:01.038
And teller makes it doubly so.
>> It does indeed.

34:01.040 --> 34:01.605
>> It does indeed.
>> What do you think?

34:01.607 --> 34:02.639
>> What do you think?
Has he fooled you?

34:02.641 --> 34:04.808
Has he fooled you?
>> I love the fact that you're

34:04.810 --> 34:07.210
>> I love the fact that you're
doing the box trick with

34:07.212 --> 34:08.110
doing the box trick with
yourself.

34:08.112 --> 34:11.181
Yourself.
So often, magicians come out,

34:11.183 --> 34:12.716
so often, magicians come out,
and they gesture to someone else

34:12.717 --> 34:14.217
and they gesture to someone else
to do all the work.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.719
To do all the work.
As a matter of fact, I like to

34:15.721 --> 34:17.286
as a matter of fact, I like to
do that an awful lot.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.388
Do that an awful lot.
I love to gesture to someone

34:18.389 --> 34:19.255
I love to gesture to someone
else.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.324
Else.
I love the fact that you got in,

34:21.326 --> 34:23.092
I love the fact that you got in,
and you did it and did a

34:23.094 --> 34:23.659
and you did it and did a
wonderful job.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.395
Wonderful job.
And I also think you've done

34:25.397 --> 34:27.464
and I also think you've done
something that neither one of us

34:27.466 --> 34:28.665
something that neither one of us
could ever do and that is

34:28.667 --> 34:30.600
could ever do and that is
perform in short sleeves with

34:30.601 --> 34:33.402
perform in short sleeves with
great triceps.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.472
Great triceps.
Now I'll do exactly what I said,

34:35.474 --> 34:36.639
now I'll do exactly what I said,
and I will gesture to someone

34:36.641 --> 34:38.475
and I will gesture to someone
else and have him do the work.

34:38.476 --> 34:41.277
Else and have him do the work.
And teller has drawn a diagram

34:41.280 --> 34:43.246
and teller has drawn a diagram
of how we think you did that

34:43.248 --> 34:45.181
of how we think you did that
last trick, and he will show to

34:45.184 --> 34:45.649
last trick, and he will show to
you.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.184
You.
And you can take a look at it

34:47.186 --> 34:49.418
and you can take a look at it
and tell us if teller's close

34:49.420 --> 34:51.788
and tell us if teller's close
enough and whether we have been

34:51.790 --> 34:52.822
enough and whether we have been
fooled or not.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.190
Fooled or not.
Your call.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.458
Your call.
>> You've not been fooled.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.193
>> You've not been fooled.
>> Okay.

no one needs to ever know
how you did that.

35:03.635 --> 35:04.701
How you did that.
