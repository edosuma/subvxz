01:32.300 --> 01:33.920
Bonjour monsieur.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.590
Bonjour.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.760
Bonjour monsieur. Say bonjour.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.260
Bonjour.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.060
Once upon a time...

01:46.140 --> 01:48.100
there was a quiet
little village

01:48.190 --> 01:50.060
in the French countryside

01:50.150 --> 01:53.190
whose people believed in tranquilite

01:54.990 --> 01:57.320
Tranquility.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.620
Come holy ghost

02:00.700 --> 02:03.370
Creator come

02:03.450 --> 02:08.539
From thy bright
heavenly throne

02:08.620 --> 02:14.420
Come take possession
ofour souls

02:14.510 --> 02:21.840
And make them all thine own

02:21.930 --> 02:24.600
Far from us drive our...

02:24.680 --> 02:26.970
Ifyou lived in this village...

02:27.060 --> 02:29.520
you understood what was expected ofyou.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.270
...unto us bring

02:33.360 --> 02:35.190
And through all...

02:35.280 --> 02:36.440
You knewyour place

02:36.530 --> 02:37.740
in the scheme ofthings.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.490
Lead us safe

02:39.570 --> 02:42.200
And ifyou happened to forget...

02:42.280 --> 02:44.200
someone would help remind you.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.920
The season of Lent is upon us.

02:59.010 --> 03:03.300
This is, ofcourse, a time ofabstinence.

03:03.390 --> 03:07.640
Hopefully, also a time of reflection.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.310
Above all, let this be for us a time...

03:12.480 --> 03:14.900
A time ofsincere penitence.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.400
It is a time to stand up and be counted.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.820
In this village...

03:20.900 --> 03:24.410
ifyou saw something
you weren't supposed to see

03:24.490 --> 03:26.330
you learned to look the other way.

03:26.410 --> 03:28.120
This is a time for Christ.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.000
When you reflect, he knows what you reflect on.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.250
If by chance

03:32.330 --> 03:35.380
your hopes had been disappointed...

03:35.460 --> 03:39.170
you learned never to ask for more.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.260
He knows forwhat you must be forgiven.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.850
So in this year ofour lord, 1959, things...

03:46.930 --> 03:50.470
So, through good times and bad...

03:50.560 --> 03:52.310
famine and feast...

03:52.390 --> 03:56.190
the villagers held fast to their traditions.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.190
Until...

03:58.280 --> 04:00.030
one winter day...

04:00.110 --> 04:03.950
a sly wind blew in from the north.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.290
Where will we find truth?

04:14.170 --> 04:15.920
Where do we start looking?

04:17.959 --> 04:19.589
Where will we find truth?

04:19.670 --> 04:21.050
We will find it...

05:20.860 --> 05:22.110
Who the hell are you?

05:25.280 --> 05:28.660
We're here about the patisserie.

05:28.740 --> 05:29.870
We'd like to rent it.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.950
And the apartment above.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.370
Where are you from?

05:34.450 --> 05:38.710
Well, we lived in Andalusia for a while.

05:38.790 --> 05:41.540
Let me see. Before that...

05:41.630 --> 05:42.550
Vienna...

05:42.630 --> 05:44.760
and before that...

05:44.840 --> 05:45.760
Before that...

05:45.840 --> 05:46.760
Athens.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.930
- Pavia.
- Pavia, yes.

05:48.010 --> 05:50.090
Pantoufle hated it there.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.470
Pantoufle is her kangaroo.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.390
But he can't hop.

05:54.470 --> 05:57.690
Bad leg. War injury, huh?

06:13.870 --> 06:17.580
I'll expect you to keep it in good condition.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.180
What a nice town this is.

06:37.270 --> 06:38.850
Don't you think so, Mama?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.940
It's a lovely town.

06:42.770 --> 06:46.440
Mama, Pantoufle wants to know
how long we can stay.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.320
Tell Pantoufle not to worry.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.240
Time for bed. What story tonight?

06:54.330 --> 06:58.700
Pantoufle wants to hear
about Grandmère and Grandpère.

06:58.790 --> 07:01.040
Not tonight, Anouska.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.500
You always say that.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.090
Tell about Grandmère and Grandpère

07:06.170 --> 07:08.670
Not tonight.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.800
How about the princess and the pirates?

07:11.890 --> 07:13.640
Ok.

07:14.550 --> 07:16.430
Prepare to fire!

07:16.520 --> 07:19.140
All hands on deck!

07:19.230 --> 07:22.060
Ready, aim...

07:22.150 --> 07:23.600
fire!

07:25.770 --> 07:28.320
Forgive the intrusion.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.150
It's a pleasure.

07:32.860 --> 07:34.450
Sorry, monsieur.

07:34.950 --> 07:36.080
Pirate attack.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.160
Ofcourse.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.660
What is your name?

07:39.750 --> 07:41.870
Anouk. What's yours?

07:41.960 --> 07:44.830
I am the Comte de Reynaud at your service.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.500
A real one?

07:46.590 --> 07:48.710
Like the Comte de Monte Cristo?

07:49.460 --> 07:51.300
He was not a real one.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.800
To what do we owe the honor ofyour visit?

07:53.890 --> 07:56.140
Well, as mayor of Lansquenet...

07:56.220 --> 07:58.600
I want to welcome you
to the community

07:58.680 --> 08:02.480
and to invite you to worship
with us at mass on Sunday.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.860
That's very kind ofyou,
but actually we don't attend.

08:08.900 --> 08:11.570
We're glad to be so near the church though.

08:11.650 --> 08:12.610
We'll enjoy singing with the bells...

08:12.700 --> 08:13.860
won't we, Nou-Nou?

08:13.950 --> 08:17.530
The bells are not intended
as an entertainment, madame.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.450
They are a solemn call to worship for-

08:19.540 --> 08:21.370
Mademoiselle.

08:21.450 --> 08:22.540
I beg your pardon?

08:22.620 --> 08:24.580
Mademoiselle. I've never been married...

08:24.670 --> 08:26.330
but feel free to call me Vianne.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.260
I do hope you'll stop by

08:31.340 --> 08:32.970
when I open for business next week.

08:33.049 --> 08:35.720
Yes.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.470
Yes, opening a patisserie
during the holy Lenten fast.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.220
I could imagine better timing.

08:41.309 --> 08:43.730
Oh, but it's not going to be a patisserie.

08:43.809 --> 08:45.390
Then what do you intend to—

08:45.480 --> 08:47.310
It's a surprise.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.940
It was sweet ofyou to drop by.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.410
The Comte de Reynaud

08:59.490 --> 09:04.330
was a student of history
and therefore a patient man.

09:04.410 --> 09:08.540
He trusted the wisdom ofgenerations past.

09:08.630 --> 09:12.550
Like his ancestors, he watched
over the little village

09:12.630 --> 09:13.630
Bonjour.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.880
and led by his own example-

09:15.970 --> 09:19.890
Hard work, modesty...

09:19.970 --> 09:21.890
self-discipline.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.780
I have completed the 18th century.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.700
Madame Clairmont.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.620
Your letter to the editor, Monsieur le Comte.

09:45.710 --> 09:49.120
This paragraph about family
and tradition, it's...

09:49.210 --> 09:51.290
It's beautiful.

09:53.170 --> 09:55.460
Well, thankyou.

09:55.550 --> 09:57.300
I value your opinion.

10:05.350 --> 10:08.270
May I ask,
have you been in contact

10:08.350 --> 10:10.600
with your mother recently?

10:10.690 --> 10:11.810
Why?

10:11.900 --> 10:14.610
She seems to have rented out the patisserie.

10:15.650 --> 10:20.110
Well, I haven't
talked to my mother

10:20.200 --> 10:21.240
in quite a while.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.280
Oh, I'm sorry. I did not mean to pry.

10:23.370 --> 10:26.080
Oh, don't be silly.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.250
I have no secrets from you.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.420
How is the comtesse enjoying Venice?

10:32.500 --> 10:36.510
The comtesse? Oh, she's fine, thankyou.

10:36.590 --> 10:39.170
Yes, she's enjoying it very much.

10:40.590 --> 10:42.850
Venice.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.820
I heard she was some kind of radical.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.630
I heard she's an atheist.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.350
What's that?

11:24.430 --> 11:26.890
Don't know.

11:36.020 --> 11:41.900
Come on.

12:35.170 --> 12:36.580
You should be more careful!

12:36.670 --> 12:38.380
So sorry, madame.

12:38.460 --> 12:39.550
I'm sorry.

12:39.630 --> 12:40.800
Are you all right?

12:40.880 --> 12:42.420
I'm fine, I'm fine.

12:42.510 --> 12:43.840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12:43.930 --> 12:44.970
Do you want to come in and sit down?

12:45.050 --> 12:46.180
No, no. Please don't trouble yourself.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.390
I'm fine.

12:47.470 --> 12:50.060
No, it's no trouble. I'm Vianne Rocher.

12:50.140 --> 12:51.600
Caroline Clairmont.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.020
I'm the daughter ofyour landlady.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.020
This is my son Luc.

12:54.100 --> 12:56.400
Oh, hello. And this is my Anouk.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.650
Come in, please, where it's warm.

12:58.730 --> 13:00.320
Try this.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.610
I bet you've never
had hot chocolate

13:02.690 --> 13:05.150
made from a 2,000-year-old recipe.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.660
Thankyou, but no. Luc.

13:07.910 --> 13:08.990
No.

13:11.950 --> 13:12.870
What's this?

13:12.950 --> 13:15.580
What do you see, madame, in this?

13:15.670 --> 13:16.960
Sorry?

13:17.040 --> 13:18.670
What does it look like to you?

13:18.750 --> 13:20.420
Just say the first thing

13:20.500 --> 13:21.880
that comes into your mind.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.550
A woman riding a wild horse?

13:30.850 --> 13:31.760
Oh, silly answer.

13:31.850 --> 13:33.310
Oh, no. There are no silly answers.

13:33.390 --> 13:35.270
The pepper triangle, that's foryou.

13:35.350 --> 13:37.310
A tiny hint ofchili pepper

13:37.400 --> 13:40.020
to play against the sweetness.

13:41.110 --> 13:43.570
Tangy, adventurous.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.580
What do you see?

13:57.080 --> 13:58.750
I see teeth.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.630
I see blood...

14:01.710 --> 14:04.050
and a skull.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.470
Very dark.

14:08.550 --> 14:10.970
Bitter chocolate. That's your favorite.

14:11.050 --> 14:14.060
Which will have to wait 5 weeks more.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.890
Lent. Thankyou.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.900
We must run along. It's been nice to meet you.

14:19.980 --> 14:20.900
Come.

14:22.020 --> 14:23.230
My pleasure.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.440
Pantoufle, come on! Pirate attack!

14:26.900 --> 14:29.990
How much are those chili things, please?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.660
4.50 a box.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.120
Could you put a ribbon on it?

14:34.580 --> 14:36.080
Then I can pretend they are from my husband.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.750
Ofcourse.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.800
Josephine Muscat.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.960
She waltzes to her own tune.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.680
And these are foryour husband—

14:51.760 --> 14:54.850
Unrefined cocoa nips from Guatemala—

14:54.930 --> 14:56.720
To awaken the passions.

14:58.890 --> 15:01.600
You've obviously never met my husband.

15:01.690 --> 15:05.770
You've obviously never tried these.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.090
Don't be pathetic.

15:54.660 --> 15:56.030
Luc.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.620
You've got a tiny error in problem 6—

15:58.700 --> 15:59.910
Luc!

16:01.210 --> 16:03.170
It's nothing.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.670
It already stopped.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.880
Mother, the new teacher

16:10.970 --> 16:13.300
wants us to correct our own mistakes.

16:13.380 --> 16:15.890
I didn't tell you how to correct the mistake...

16:15.970 --> 16:18.010
I just told you that you made one.

17:37.260 --> 17:39.760
Not hungry, Monsieur le Comte?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.680
The Lenten fast, Madame Rivet.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.600
Are you not supposed to eat something?

17:47.100 --> 17:48.770
It's all right. Leave it.

18:46.290 --> 18:47.660
Hello.

18:49.330 --> 18:50.290
May I help you?

18:52.670 --> 18:55.380
It's expensive. I don't waste money.

18:55.460 --> 18:58.590
I have a knack for guessing people's favorites.

18:59.930 --> 19:04.930
These are your favorites. Am I right?

19:05.010 --> 19:06.060
On the house.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.730
I think I'd bet—

19:20.700 --> 19:22.360
Well...

19:22.450 --> 19:24.240
This certainly is different.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.450
Yes. Very different.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.660
Look at that.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.630
I'm so sorry.

19:33.710 --> 19:35.670
Bonjour Monsieur Blerot.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.670
Bonjour Madame Audel.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.270
No. Not that way, Charlie.

19:53.350 --> 19:54.650
Come on.

19:54.730 --> 19:56.820
Come in! Please.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.480
Come on, boy.

19:59.570 --> 20:00.780
I've got something foryou.

20:07.580 --> 20:08.580
What's your name?

20:08.660 --> 20:11.160
Charlie. He's 14 years old.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.830
That's 98 in human years.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.830
No, I meant your name.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.750
Guillaume Blerot.

20:18.840 --> 20:20.840
You're very kind.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.170
He has so few pleasures left.

20:23.260 --> 20:26.340
Would you care...

20:26.430 --> 20:28.510
Would you care to buy...

20:28.600 --> 20:31.520
something special foryour lady friend?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.350
Lady friend?

20:33.440 --> 20:34.770
The lovely woman

20:34.850 --> 20:36.520
your dog was so fond of.

20:38.730 --> 20:40.570
Her favorite is chocolate seashells.

20:40.650 --> 20:41.900
That's my guess.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.530
Oh, no. I mustn't.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.530
Madame Audel is in mourning for her husband.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.950
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.700
When did he pass away?

20:51.790 --> 20:55.000
The war. German grenade.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.880
Well, it's been 15 years since the war, so...

20:59.960 --> 21:01.500
- Not that war.
- Surely...

21:01.590 --> 21:04.880
MonsieurAudel was killed on January 12, 191 7.

21:06.430 --> 21:09.100
It was quite a blow to Madame Audel.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.140
Apparently so.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.900
Bonjour mesdames!

21:16.980 --> 21:20.320
Bonjour Monsieur le Comte.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.740
I wish all my tenants

21:25.820 --> 21:28.280
were as reliable as you, Madame Drou.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.370
How is the comtesse enjoying Italy?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.580
She may be extending her trip.

21:37.670 --> 21:39.670
Very nice.

21:42.880 --> 21:43.880
Have either ofyou seen

21:43.970 --> 21:45.920
the new shop across the square?

21:46.010 --> 21:48.430
Oh, the chocolaterie? Yes.

21:48.510 --> 21:50.890
Shameless, isn't it?

21:52.810 --> 21:54.390
The sheer nerve ofthe woman...

21:54.480 --> 21:59.270
opening a chocolaterie just in time for Lent.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.230
The woman is brazen.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.030
My heart goes out to that poor

22:07.110 --> 22:09.280
illegitimate child of hers.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.320
Oh, yeah.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.330
Bonjour.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.880
You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog

22:21.960 --> 22:25.800
Cryin' all the time

22:25.880 --> 22:28.010
You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog

22:28.090 --> 22:30.590
Cryin' all the time

22:30.680 --> 22:32.970
Well, you ain't never
caught no rabbit

22:33.060 --> 22:35.140
You ain't no friend of mine

22:35.220 --> 22:36.430
Ooh, yeah!

22:36.520 --> 22:38.730
A new addition to the liturgy?

22:40.270 --> 22:42.650
I have a weakness for American music...

22:42.730 --> 22:44.520
Monsieur le Comte.

22:44.610 --> 22:46.900
How long have you been with us, Père Henri?

22:46.990 --> 22:49.860
It will be... 5 weeks.

22:49.950 --> 22:51.950
Your predecessor, Père Michel...

22:52.030 --> 22:55.450
he was with us for...5 decades.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.290
Yes, well, I only pray

22:58.370 --> 23:00.830
I can live up to Père Michel's example.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.290
Yes, that's my prayer also.

23:04.380 --> 23:06.590
I looked at your sermon, as you requested.

23:06.670 --> 23:08.420
I've made one or 2 notes.

23:12.930 --> 23:14.220
You're very kind.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.970
Not at all.

23:17.060 --> 23:19.310
Oh, one more thing.

23:20.390 --> 23:22.690
Ifyou haven't seen the new chocolaterie..

23:22.770 --> 23:25.150
perhaps you might like to take a look.

23:25.230 --> 23:27.280
It's important to know one's enemy.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.200
Don't you think?

23:32.820 --> 23:35.200
Hey, where's my kiss?

23:40.960 --> 23:42.120
Watch where you're going!

23:42.210 --> 23:43.120
Excuse me!

23:43.210 --> 23:45.380
Hello. Morning.

23:46.460 --> 23:50.340
What's the decor, early Mexican brothel?

24:00.810 --> 24:04.190
No! If I need help, I'll ask for it.

24:11.490 --> 24:13.150
What do you see in it?

24:13.240 --> 24:15.030
Not a damn thing.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.570
Come on. It's a game.

24:16.660 --> 24:19.120
What do you see?

24:19.200 --> 24:23.160
I see a cranky old woman
too tired to play games.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.920
I've gotjust the thing foryou.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.090
That little girl ofyours...

24:30.170 --> 24:31.590
does she mind it?

24:31.670 --> 24:32.840
Mind what?

24:32.930 --> 24:35.340
The way you move her from place to place.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.760
She's doing fine. I think it's good for her.

24:39.850 --> 24:42.140
You know, seeing new places...

24:42.230 --> 24:42.980
meeting new people.

24:47.230 --> 24:49.520
Your cinnamon looks rancid.

24:49.610 --> 24:51.280
Well, it's not cinnamon.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.110
It's a special kind ofchili pepper.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.360
Chili pepper in hot chocolate?

24:55.450 --> 24:56.740
It'll give you a lift.

24:58.530 --> 24:59.700
There.

25:18.100 --> 25:21.310
It tastes like...

25:23.100 --> 25:24.680
I don't know.

25:31.070 --> 25:32.230
Hop, hop, hop, hop!

25:32.320 --> 25:34.150
Where's your kangaroo?

25:35.450 --> 25:36.490
Hop, hop, hop!

25:36.570 --> 25:38.240
I'm your kangaroo now!

25:40.280 --> 25:44.700
Stop it!

25:44.790 --> 25:47.670
Anouk! In this school, we are civilized.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.580
We do not strike one another!

25:49.670 --> 25:51.460
But they insulted Pantoufle!

25:51.550 --> 25:53.840
I don't care. Didi, Dedou, come along!

25:57.260 --> 25:58.760
And be quiet.

26:00.470 --> 26:02.810
Where's Pantoufle?

26:05.730 --> 26:08.650
My mother says you don't have a father.

26:08.730 --> 26:10.860
Sure I do.

26:10.940 --> 26:12.610
Wejust don't know who he is.

26:15.110 --> 26:16.610
I was out all night with him.

26:17.780 --> 26:19.950
We swam naked in the tannes.

26:21.780 --> 26:24.410
At dawn, when I returned to my house in my bed...

26:24.500 --> 26:26.790
my mother poked her head in and said...

26:26.870 --> 26:28.920
"Wake up, sleepyhead."

26:30.790 --> 26:32.540
She had no idea I'd been gone.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.400
Sure you didn't put booze in there?

26:52.480 --> 26:55.150
Nah. Something better.

26:55.230 --> 26:57.780
Perhaps you should give it to my daughter.

26:57.860 --> 27:01.530
Melt that chilly disposition of hers.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.620
You and Caroline have a problem?

27:03.700 --> 27:06.660
Do we have a problem?

27:08.120 --> 27:11.250
She won't let me see my grandson.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.670
I'm cut offfrom him.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.960
Why is that?

27:16.050 --> 27:18.550
Armande, why is that?

27:19.930 --> 27:22.340
Oh, I'm a bad influence.

27:22.430 --> 27:26.100
'Cause I don't like her treating
him like a trained poodle.

27:26.180 --> 27:29.350
I swear, that boy doesn't piss
without her permission.

27:33.150 --> 27:34.690
Ever since her husband died...

27:34.770 --> 27:36.610
she's been so...

27:42.030 --> 27:45.120
The way she frets and fusses over that boy.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.450
Ifonly she'd let him run, let him breathe...

27:47.540 --> 27:49.870
let him live.

27:49.960 --> 27:53.880
But she worries that he will overexert himself.

27:55.210 --> 27:56.540
Not much danger ofthat.

27:56.630 --> 27:59.210
She won't even let the poor kid ride a bicycle.

28:01.720 --> 28:04.550
Do you think he'd like to see you?

28:06.930 --> 28:09.720
Do you have more ofthose bean thingies, please?

28:09.810 --> 28:11.480
Oh, sure.

28:12.730 --> 28:14.810
How many do you want?

28:14.900 --> 28:15.940
How many have you got?

28:21.490 --> 28:23.610
Jack of hearts is a better hunter than you, eh?

28:23.700 --> 28:26.910
Shoots the trump from right out underyour nose.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.340
Are you Serge Muscat?

28:40.420 --> 28:42.760
The one and only. What's your pleasure?

28:42.840 --> 28:44.510
Is yourwife here?

28:44.590 --> 28:45.840
Josephine?

28:45.930 --> 28:49.930
Well, it depends what you want with Josephine.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.350
Oh, she left this at my shop.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.770
Well, let me have it. I'll give it to her.

28:56.860 --> 29:00.320
Oh, no. I'll give it to her myself, thanks.

29:00.400 --> 29:04.030
Got to go. I'm late for supper.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.740
But the game's not overyet.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.330
Do you want to play?

29:10.790 --> 29:12.330
You know belote?

29:12.410 --> 29:14.540
Ofcourse I do.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.460
Sit down.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.630
Josephine.

29:19.710 --> 29:21.250
Hello.

29:21.340 --> 29:23.050
What do you want?

29:23.130 --> 29:25.340
You forgot this.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.720
What do you want?

29:29.600 --> 29:31.100
To be your friend.

29:31.180 --> 29:34.890
I don't have friends.
Does serge know you're here?

29:34.980 --> 29:36.980
Does it matter?

29:38.310 --> 29:41.190
Do me a favor. Try one ofthese rose creams.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.190
Tell me ifyou think

29:42.280 --> 29:45.360
it's a little heavy on the Cointreau.

30:00.130 --> 30:02.340
Josephine!

30:09.800 --> 30:11.260
I'm coming!

30:11.350 --> 30:13.720
He talks about you.

30:14.890 --> 30:16.020
He says you're indecent.

30:16.100 --> 30:17.890
He says you're an influence.

30:17.980 --> 30:20.480
You're a bad influence for someone like me—

30:20.560 --> 30:22.650
I don't have
to listen to a word

30:22.730 --> 30:24.440
your husband has to say.

30:24.530 --> 30:25.900
No, not Serge.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.450
Not him.

30:27.530 --> 30:29.740
Reynaud, the mayor.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.200
He talks about you.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.210
Time to go.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.050
Look what I won.

30:45.130 --> 30:47.720
That's good. Come on.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.730
Bonsoir.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.120
Luc, mind if I take a peek?

31:22.250 --> 31:23.670
It's not really...

31:23.750 --> 31:24.960
Show me.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.340
Well, I exaggerated the angle ofthe head.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.550
You draw beautifully.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.300
What's your going rate?

31:34.390 --> 31:35.390
What?

31:35.470 --> 31:37.350
To do a portrait?

31:37.430 --> 31:39.230
How much would you charge?

31:39.310 --> 31:40.270
Oh, I...

31:41.310 --> 31:44.730
I couldn't. I'm not really a...

31:44.820 --> 31:45.860
50 francs?

31:45.940 --> 31:48.360
Sound reasonable?

31:48.440 --> 31:49.940
It'd be great.

31:51.030 --> 31:53.280
When could you come by my shop?

31:55.620 --> 31:58.540
I'm really sorry, but...

31:58.620 --> 32:00.450
the comte forbids it.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.040
He spoke to Mama this morning...

32:07.130 --> 32:08.800
and a lot ofothers.

32:12.050 --> 32:13.300
Whateveryou say.

32:13.390 --> 32:17.310
I wish I could. I really do.

32:19.060 --> 32:21.350
Thanks for showing me your drawing.

32:26.820 --> 32:28.190
Wait.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.920
Am I breaking any laws?

32:50.010 --> 32:53.630
Tell me! Am I hurting anyone?

32:53.720 --> 32:56.090
You're asking me my opinion?

32:56.180 --> 32:59.640
What exactly have you been
telling people about me?

32:59.720 --> 33:01.890
Only the truth, mademoiselle.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.520
Well...

33:04.600 --> 33:06.600
ifyou're expecting me...

33:06.690 --> 33:10.360
tojust shrivel up and blow away...

33:10.440 --> 33:12.530
you're going to be highly disappointed.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.990
Let me try and put this
into perspective foryou.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.370
The first Comte de Reynaud

33:24.460 --> 33:26.830
expelled all
the radical Huguenots

33:26.920 --> 33:28.790
from this village.

33:28.880 --> 33:33.760
You and your truffles present
a far lesser challenge.

33:35.220 --> 33:37.970
You'll be out of business by Easter.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.180
I promise you that.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.590
How long have you been standing here?

34:13.710 --> 34:15.880
I forgot to payyou for something the other day.

34:15.969 --> 34:17.219
I'm sorry.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.880
No, it was a gift.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.469
No. People talk.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.770
No, people would lie about me.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.440
I don't steal.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.350
Not on purpose.

34:30.440 --> 34:31.560
I—

34:31.650 --> 34:33.270
Yes, I know.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.610
It's nice to see you.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.610
Would you like to come in for some chocolates?

34:52.130 --> 34:54.300
This is foryou.

34:54.380 --> 34:55.630
How sweet ofyou.

34:55.710 --> 34:57.800
Thankyou.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.300
It's lovely.

35:08.100 --> 35:10.480
I heard you don't go to church.

35:11.980 --> 35:13.810
That's right.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.440
You won't last long here.

35:18.990 --> 35:20.950
People talk.

35:23.410 --> 35:25.030
Oh, sorry.

35:25.120 --> 35:27.410
I'm behaving badly, aren't I?

35:27.500 --> 35:28.910
No, no, it's ok.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.460
You don't misbehave here.

35:30.540 --> 35:33.210
It'sjust not done, did you know that?

35:34.800 --> 35:37.090
Ifyou don't go to confession

35:37.170 --> 35:39.840
Or ifyou don't...
dig your flower beds

35:39.930 --> 35:42.090
Or ifyou don't pretend...

35:42.180 --> 35:44.350
Ifyou don't pretend...

35:44.430 --> 35:47.560
that you want nothing
more in your life

35:47.640 --> 35:50.140
than to serve your
husband 3 meals a day

35:50.230 --> 35:51.440
and give him children

35:51.520 --> 35:53.150
and vacuum under his ass...

35:53.230 --> 35:56.900
then... then you're... then you're crazy.

36:03.620 --> 36:08.200
You must think I'm stupid to stay with him.

36:10.500 --> 36:13.580
No, I don't thinkyou're... you're stupid.

36:13.670 --> 36:17.800
Well, I am. I... I'm weak.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.170
I don't love my husband, and I lie.

36:22.340 --> 36:26.300
Things could be different foryou,Josephine.

36:26.390 --> 36:29.270
Serge doesn't run the world.

36:29.350 --> 36:31.980
He might as well.

36:32.060 --> 36:34.100
Is that what you believe?

36:34.190 --> 36:36.230
I know it.

36:38.860 --> 36:41.940
Then it must be true.

36:42.030 --> 36:43.240
My mistake.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.660
You make the most wonderful chocolate.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.340
Pantoufle wants
to hear the story

37:00.420 --> 37:01.760
of Grandmère and Grandpère.

37:03.340 --> 37:07.550
Don't say, "not tonight."
You always say, "not tonight."

37:07.640 --> 37:10.390
All right, all right.

37:14.100 --> 37:16.310
Your grandfather...

37:16.400 --> 37:19.320
George Rocher...

37:19.400 --> 37:21.480
was the young apothecary

37:21.570 --> 37:23.990
ofthe town ofAulus-Les-Bains.

37:24.070 --> 37:26.110
It was Anouk's favorite story.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.070
Always told in the same words.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.370
George was honest...

37:29.450 --> 37:32.750
George was honest, prosperous...

37:32.830 --> 37:35.920
and trusted by his customers.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.710
But George was not content.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.710
He felt there
should be more to life

37:40.800 --> 37:43.170
than dispensing liver oil.

37:44.970 --> 37:47.720
In the spring of 1927...

37:47.800 --> 37:49.640
the Societe Pharmeceutique

37:49.720 --> 37:52.430
formed an expedition
to Central America

37:52.520 --> 37:54.640
to study
the medicinal properties

37:54.730 --> 37:57.270
ofcertain natural compounds.

37:59.270 --> 38:02.900
George was the expedition's
most eager volunteer.

38:05.820 --> 38:09.320
But his adventure took a turn he did not expect.

38:12.580 --> 38:16.580
One night, he was invited
to drink unrefined cacao

38:16.670 --> 38:18.250
with a pinch ofchili.

38:18.330 --> 38:22.420
The very same drink
the ancient Maya

38:22.500 --> 38:24.920
used in their sacred ceremonies.

38:27.090 --> 38:29.890
The Maya believed
cacao held the power

38:29.970 --> 38:32.430
to unlock hidden yearnings.

38:34.720 --> 38:37.390
And reveal destinies.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.480
And so it was

38:41.560 --> 38:44.650
that George first saw Chitza.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.530
Now, George had been raised a good catholic...

38:52.620 --> 38:56.250
but in his romance with Chitza...

38:56.330 --> 38:58.500
he was willing
to slightly bend the rules

38:58.580 --> 39:00.540
ofChristian courtship.

39:02.420 --> 39:05.840
The tribal elders tried
to warn George about her.

39:05.920 --> 39:08.380
She was one ofthe wanderers.

39:08.470 --> 39:11.220
Her people moved
with the north wind

39:11.300 --> 39:12.800
from village to village...

39:12.890 --> 39:15.600
dispensing ancient remedies...

39:15.680 --> 39:18.020
never settling down.

39:18.100 --> 39:20.520
Not a good choice for a bride.

39:21.730 --> 39:24.610
George did not heed their warning...

39:24.690 --> 39:27.070
and for a while,
it seemed that he and Chitza

39:27.150 --> 39:29.650
might lead a happy life together in France.

39:32.490 --> 39:37.160
Alas, the clever north wind had other plans.

39:44.920 --> 39:48.510
One morning,
George awoke to discover

39:48.590 --> 39:52.050
that Chitza and the little girl Vianne...

39:52.140 --> 39:53.430
had gone away.

39:56.970 --> 39:58.520
Mother and daughter

39:58.600 --> 40:01.690
were fated to wander from village to village...

40:01.770 --> 40:05.730
dispensing ancient cacao remedies...

40:05.820 --> 40:08.150
traveling with the wind.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.780
Just as Chitza's people had done...

40:11.860 --> 40:12.950
for generations.

40:13.030 --> 40:15.240
Just as Chitza's people

40:15.330 --> 40:17.450
had done for generations.

40:19.830 --> 40:22.580
Will itjust go on forever?

40:28.170 --> 40:29.590
Night, Mama.

40:47.650 --> 40:49.820
I appreciate your coming in, Armande.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.400
All right, what's so important

40:51.490 --> 40:54.240
that I had to postpone my nap?

40:54.320 --> 40:56.160
I've got some chocolate cake.

41:07.790 --> 41:11.800
Grandmother. Grandmother, bonjour.

41:14.340 --> 41:16.180
May I—

41:18.430 --> 41:20.680
Would you like a cup of-

41:20.770 --> 41:24.310
No. No, thankyou, I'm just here to...

41:24.390 --> 41:25.520
do a portrait.

41:27.190 --> 41:28.940
Whose?

41:29.020 --> 41:31.820
Yours, actually.

41:31.900 --> 41:34.320
Is the light ok where she's sitting?

41:38.700 --> 41:42.660
I have something foryou, boy.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.580
I've been carrying it around
since your last birthday.

41:49.420 --> 41:51.300
It's a book of poetry.

41:56.890 --> 41:58.090
Thankyou.

41:58.180 --> 42:00.800
You don't like poetry?

42:00.890 --> 42:04.140
Oh, no, no, no. Ofcourse, I do.

42:04.230 --> 42:05.390
Yes.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.890
Neither do I.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.560
It's not that kind of poetry.

42:14.570 --> 42:17.820
And in a moment ofweakness...

42:17.910 --> 42:19.820
I prayed to the virgin mother

42:19.910 --> 42:22.830
to soothe Charlie's soul
in his hour ofsuffering.

42:22.910 --> 42:27.830
You understand an animal has no immortal soul.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.830
I understand, monpère

42:30.920 --> 42:33.420
Yet you flout god's law.

42:33.500 --> 42:36.340
I'm weak and a sinner.

42:36.420 --> 42:37.420
What else?

42:40.430 --> 42:42.890
Impure thoughts.

42:42.970 --> 42:45.970
The woman who runs the chocolaterie

42:46.060 --> 42:47.310
Vianne Rocher?

42:47.390 --> 42:49.350
She suggested I buy
chocolate seashells

42:49.440 --> 42:52.400
for the widow Audel.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.190
And, well...

42:55.280 --> 42:56.690
I guess that got me to thinking

42:56.780 --> 42:58.240
about the widow Audel.

42:58.320 --> 43:02.240
At her age? At your age?

43:02.330 --> 43:06.080
Yes. And yes.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.250
And just what were you doing

43:08.330 --> 43:10.620
in a chocolaterie during Lent?

43:10.710 --> 43:13.710
It was for Charlie.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.880
Again you flout God's law.

43:19.220 --> 43:23.850
Well, but ifCharlie has no soul...

43:23.930 --> 43:27.270
then there's no harm in him breaking Lent.

43:27.350 --> 43:29.730
Isn't that so, monpère?

43:31.980 --> 43:34.440
10 Hail Marys, 20 Our Fathers.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.570
"Will she never have done, then...

43:38.650 --> 43:43.240
that ghoul queen ofa million dead bodies?

43:43.320 --> 43:45.910
I see myselfagain...

43:45.990 --> 43:49.080
skin rotten with mud and pest...

43:49.160 --> 43:54.460
worms in my armpits and in my hair."

43:54.540 --> 43:56.880
It's perfectly wretched, isn't it?

43:56.960 --> 43:58.550
Perfectly.

44:01.300 --> 44:04.640
Would you like some cake?

44:05.680 --> 44:07.180
I'm not supposed to.

44:07.270 --> 44:10.810
Don't worry so much about not supposed to.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.360
Live a little.

44:24.280 --> 44:26.700
Oh, her hair appointment's almost done.

44:28.620 --> 44:29.870
I have to go.

44:29.950 --> 44:31.370
What about my picture?

44:31.460 --> 44:32.910
Next time.

44:35.210 --> 44:37.250
Thankyou for the cake.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.920
Don't look so damn pleased with yourself.

44:51.890 --> 44:53.770
Stay here.

45:01.360 --> 45:02.650
I did it.

45:04.860 --> 45:07.740
I did it. He...

45:07.830 --> 45:09.740
He was so drunk.

45:09.830 --> 45:14.000
He... He woke up.

45:14.080 --> 45:17.040
He woke up. He saw me packing, but...

45:17.130 --> 45:18.500
so he tried to come after me...

45:18.590 --> 45:22.340
but I had already tied
his feet with his belt, and...

45:26.840 --> 45:29.510
Boom! Right on his face.

45:31.060 --> 45:34.430
Right there on his big, red face.

45:44.990 --> 45:48.910
It is so stupid, isn't it?

45:48.990 --> 45:52.040
I never blame him.

45:52.120 --> 45:56.830
Sometimes I even forget what really happened.

46:09.470 --> 46:10.550
I saved her!

46:10.640 --> 46:12.310
You remember her father

46:12.390 --> 46:14.180
collaborated with the Germans?

46:14.270 --> 46:16.060
Nobody wanted to touch her.

46:16.140 --> 46:18.150
Except for me.

46:18.230 --> 46:20.060
And this is the way she repays me?!

46:20.150 --> 46:21.440
Your anger is understandable.

46:21.520 --> 46:23.610
Anger? Everybody's gonna be laughing at me!

46:23.690 --> 46:26.070
That is not your concern.

46:26.150 --> 46:28.450
Your concern is the sacrament of marriage.

46:29.660 --> 46:31.280
Yeah, ofcourse. The sacrament.

46:31.370 --> 46:32.740
Yes.

46:32.830 --> 46:35.410
Dip the ganshbe into the white chocolate.

46:36.830 --> 46:37.910
Like this?

46:38.000 --> 46:41.540
Good. Yes, shake it, a little.

46:41.630 --> 46:42.590
Good.

46:42.670 --> 46:44.920
Put it on the parchment sheet.

46:45.010 --> 46:46.210
You're doing great.

46:50.180 --> 46:51.680
I'll be right back.

47:00.190 --> 47:01.440
Good morning.

47:01.520 --> 47:05.230
Can I interest you in some nipples ofVenus?

47:05.320 --> 47:08.030
Rumor has it that you are
harboring Madam Muscat.

47:08.110 --> 47:10.200
Is that true?

47:10.280 --> 47:11.990
You make her sound like a fugitive.

47:12.070 --> 47:14.490
She is a fugitive, from her marriage vows...

47:14.580 --> 47:16.700
which have been sanctified by God.

47:18.660 --> 47:20.170
Josephine?

47:20.250 --> 47:22.710
Come out here a minute.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.470
Let his radiance have a look at you.

47:34.060 --> 47:36.720
Is that sanctified enough foryou?

47:36.810 --> 47:37.890
It's not the first time.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.770
I'm truly sorry.

47:41.850 --> 47:44.230
You should have come to me.

47:44.320 --> 47:47.820
Your husband will be made to repent for this.

47:47.900 --> 47:51.240
Tell him to repent on someone else's head.

47:52.240 --> 47:54.200
Come on. In!

47:54.280 --> 47:55.240
Monsieur le Comte!

47:55.330 --> 47:57.450
I'm going to make an example ofyou.

47:57.540 --> 47:59.960
In there.

48:00.040 --> 48:01.210
He's ready.

48:01.290 --> 48:03.630
Well, but confession
must be made

48:03.710 --> 48:05.710
in the spirit ofcontrition.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.260
Have you come in the spirit ofcontrition?

48:08.340 --> 48:09.630
Contrition, yes.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.420
He's ready.

48:14.510 --> 48:15.680
Licentiousness...

48:15.760 --> 48:18.350
idolatry, sorcery...

48:18.430 --> 48:20.390
gluttony, and drunkenness.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.940
Correct.

48:23.020 --> 48:24.650
And what are the 3 conditions

48:24.730 --> 48:26.650
for mortal sin?

48:26.730 --> 48:27.730
Serge?

48:29.070 --> 48:30.650
Mortal sin...

48:32.740 --> 48:36.490
is sin whose object is...

48:37.830 --> 48:39.620
committed by...

48:39.700 --> 48:42.040
deliberate...

48:42.120 --> 48:43.330
Consequence...

48:43.420 --> 48:45.540
Incorrect. Didi?

48:45.630 --> 48:49.550
Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter...

48:49.630 --> 48:52.050
which is committed
with full knowledge

48:52.130 --> 48:53.840
and deliberate consent.

48:53.930 --> 48:54.880
Correct.

49:05.480 --> 49:06.900
So, how do you know

49:06.980 --> 49:08.980
ifthe coverture is properly tempered?

49:09.070 --> 49:13.650
Ahh, first you check to see
if it's at body temperature.

49:14.700 --> 49:17.070
Then you dip the palette knife

49:17.160 --> 49:19.700
to see that the coverture hardens on it evenly.

49:19.790 --> 49:20.740
Correct.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.370
Closer.

49:28.090 --> 49:30.800
In the village, time passed.

49:36.010 --> 49:39.600
And the chocolaterie did not go out of business.

49:58.490 --> 49:59.910
The Comte de Reynaud

49:59.990 --> 50:03.750
felt himself being drawn into a strange crusade.

50:07.120 --> 50:10.960
His struggle to transform Serge
into a gentleman

50:11.050 --> 50:14.840
became more than an act ofgood will.

50:14.920 --> 50:17.470
It became a test...

50:17.550 --> 50:21.260
a holy war between château...

50:21.350 --> 50:23.560
and chocolaterie.

50:46.410 --> 50:47.910
Each time, I...

50:48.000 --> 50:50.830
I tell myself it's the last time.

50:50.920 --> 50:53.000
But then I...

50:53.090 --> 50:55.920
I get a whiffofa hot chocolate.

50:56.010 --> 50:58.720
Or... Or those moon things.

50:58.800 --> 51:00.050
Chocolate seashells.

51:00.140 --> 51:04.010
So small, so plain, so innocent.

51:04.100 --> 51:06.350
I thought,just one little taste...

51:06.430 --> 51:08.390
it can't do any harm.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.100
But it turned out
that they were filled

51:10.190 --> 51:12.560
with rich, sinful...

51:12.650 --> 51:13.690
Buttery filling...

51:13.770 --> 51:16.110
and it melts, god forgive me...

51:16.190 --> 51:18.860
it melts ever-so-slowly
on your tongue

51:18.950 --> 51:21.070
and tortures you with pleasure.

51:21.160 --> 51:23.620
Against you alone, have I sinned.

51:23.700 --> 51:26.240
And done what is evil in your sight.

51:30.210 --> 51:32.330
Indeed I was born guilty...

51:32.420 --> 51:35.960
a sinnerwhen my mother conceived me.

51:36.050 --> 51:37.880
You desire truth in the inward being...

51:37.970 --> 51:41.470
therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.

51:44.970 --> 51:46.890
Now, the comte was no fool.

51:46.970 --> 51:49.850
Though he hoped to redeem Serge...

51:49.940 --> 51:51.900
he knew that
this redemption alone

51:51.980 --> 51:53.230
would not be enough

51:53.310 --> 51:55.610
to regain control over the village.

51:55.690 --> 51:58.650
He understood
that some larger lesson

51:58.740 --> 52:00.320
needed to be taught.

52:05.160 --> 52:06.950
Some greater problem

52:07.040 --> 52:11.210
needed to be identified and solved.

52:13.710 --> 52:15.750
Little did the comte suspect

52:15.840 --> 52:17.420
that his greater problem

52:17.510 --> 52:19.840
would arrive
one quiet afternoon

52:19.920 --> 52:22.760
in the dull green waters ofthe River Tannes.

52:26.810 --> 52:31.060
You're it!

52:31.140 --> 52:32.560
Hey, look!

52:37.320 --> 52:38.860
I'm over here!

52:48.620 --> 52:51.200
You've never really told me what the problem is...

52:51.290 --> 52:53.040
between you and Caroline.

52:53.120 --> 52:55.380
'Cause it's none ofyour damn business.

52:58.750 --> 53:00.840
I'm an embarrassment to her.

53:03.050 --> 53:07.970
I swear, I... read dirty books.

53:08.060 --> 53:10.720
I eat and drink what I like.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.140
And sin ofsins...

53:14.230 --> 53:17.650
I refuse to go to Les Mimosas.

53:17.730 --> 53:19.320
When I was a kid...

53:19.400 --> 53:21.280
we used to call it le mortoir.

53:23.070 --> 53:26.160
It's a nursing home for old...

53:26.240 --> 53:28.030
It's in Toulouse.

53:29.580 --> 53:31.870
Caroline loves
the thought ofa nurse

53:31.950 --> 53:35.500
with a clipboard recording my bowel movements.

53:35.580 --> 53:37.790
Mama, Mama, come quick!

53:37.880 --> 53:40.000
They're here! They've come to Lansquent!

53:40.090 --> 53:41.380
Slow down, Anouk, who's here?

53:41.460 --> 53:43.340
Pirates!

53:43.420 --> 53:44.340
Come on!

53:44.430 --> 53:45.510
Why can't we stay?

53:45.590 --> 53:46.550
Come on!

53:46.640 --> 53:49.010
But why can't we stay?

53:49.100 --> 53:50.010
Ok, enough.

53:50.100 --> 53:53.270
But, Mama,just a little bit.

53:53.350 --> 53:54.270
Come on.

53:55.480 --> 53:57.770
Hello. How are you?

53:59.520 --> 54:01.360
Anybody got a sweet tooth?

54:21.170 --> 54:23.130
I bet he's the captain.

54:26.470 --> 54:28.510
Anouk, don't do that.

54:28.590 --> 54:31.220
Anouk, don't do that, please.

54:31.310 --> 54:32.640
How do you do?

54:32.720 --> 54:33.640
Sorry.

54:33.720 --> 54:35.390
I'd like to apologize.

54:35.480 --> 54:37.350
For all of us.

54:37.440 --> 54:38.520
Sincerely.

54:38.600 --> 54:39.900
What for?

54:39.980 --> 54:43.320
Forwhatever it is you're here to accuse us of.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.190
Why would I do that?

54:45.280 --> 54:47.570
Well, because we river rats

54:47.660 --> 54:49.910
are the dregs ofsociety.

54:49.990 --> 54:52.240
With horrible diseases and criminal impulses.

54:52.330 --> 54:55.750
Sounds terrifying.

54:55.830 --> 54:56.910
Is it true?

54:57.000 --> 54:59.290
It's what you townspeople always seem to think...

54:59.380 --> 55:00.580
isn't it?

55:00.670 --> 55:03.340
This is not my town. Sorry.

55:03.420 --> 55:05.920
Well, then, what do you want?

55:06.010 --> 55:07.630
Are you here to save us?

55:07.720 --> 55:09.930
Are you the catholic aid society?

55:10.010 --> 55:12.350
French Family League? Communist workers?

55:12.430 --> 55:13.930
Which idea are you selling?

55:14.010 --> 55:15.430
Chocolate.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.180
I'm sorry, chocolate?

55:17.270 --> 55:19.100
What's a river rat?

55:19.190 --> 55:21.020
Is it like a pirate?

55:22.190 --> 55:23.560
Yeah, you could say that. Yeah.

55:23.650 --> 55:25.570
You could.

55:25.650 --> 55:28.110
Have a look at my treasure chest.

55:30.450 --> 55:32.450
Let me guess, they're for sale.

55:32.530 --> 55:33.950
As a matter offact, they are.

55:34.030 --> 55:35.540
For a mere 30 francs apiece.

55:36.620 --> 55:38.830
You laugh? I can get 50 for them in Paris.

55:38.910 --> 55:41.580
Then go to Paris.

55:49.880 --> 55:51.260
We'll take 2, please.

55:51.340 --> 55:52.260
You'll take 2?

55:52.340 --> 55:53.850
Yes, please, absolutely.

55:53.930 --> 55:55.050
Ok.

55:56.560 --> 55:59.180
I don't know if I have the right change.

55:59.270 --> 56:00.230
Just a minute.

56:00.310 --> 56:01.980
They're beautiful.

56:02.060 --> 56:04.520
Ireland's finest.

56:04.610 --> 56:05.690
Thanks.

56:05.770 --> 56:07.820
Thankyou. Listen...

56:07.900 --> 56:09.990
I should probably warn you.

56:10.070 --> 56:12.320
You make friends with us...

56:12.410 --> 56:13.820
you'll make enemies ofothers.

56:13.910 --> 56:15.740
That a promise?

56:18.910 --> 56:20.750
It's a guarantee.

56:33.430 --> 56:35.680
What's he up to?

56:35.760 --> 56:38.640
Maybe he'sjoining the circus.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.810
Sorry, we're closed!

56:59.870 --> 57:02.870
Josephine, you look different.

57:02.960 --> 57:05.540
So do you.

57:08.130 --> 57:11.460
I just want to tell you that I am so sorry.

57:11.550 --> 57:14.220
For everything.

57:14.300 --> 57:16.220
But I've changed.

57:16.300 --> 57:19.600
You see, God has made me a new man.

57:21.730 --> 57:25.060
I askyou, I... I beg you...

57:25.150 --> 57:27.610
please accept my apology.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.620
I accept.

57:43.830 --> 57:46.080
I promise, from now on...

57:46.170 --> 57:47.830
everything will be different.

57:50.250 --> 57:52.710
Everything already is different, Serge.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.220
Yeah.

57:54.300 --> 57:56.720
Well, I mean, when you come home.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.390
Home?

58:01.140 --> 58:05.390
Thanks for the apology.
The flowers are... lovely.

58:05.480 --> 58:07.520
No, please don't,Josephine.

58:07.600 --> 58:10.270
We are still married in the eyes ofGod.

58:10.360 --> 58:12.860
Then he must be blind.

58:19.490 --> 58:22.330
The council has no legal authority

58:22.410 --> 58:23.950
to force them to move.

58:24.040 --> 58:26.830
The riverbank is public land.

58:30.630 --> 58:33.750
The mayor wishes to say a few words.

58:33.840 --> 58:35.090
If I may...

58:35.170 --> 58:36.880
ladies and gentlemen ofthe council.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.760
These people are...

58:40.850 --> 58:43.010
rootless, Godless drifters.

58:43.100 --> 58:44.890
That's right!

58:44.980 --> 58:46.890
Theirs is the way ofslovenly pleasure.

58:46.980 --> 58:48.310
Yes.

58:48.400 --> 58:52.480
They would contaminate
the spirit ofour quiet town.

58:52.570 --> 58:55.780
The innocence ofour children.

58:55.860 --> 58:58.530
Now, the chairman ofthe council is quite right.

58:58.610 --> 59:00.820
We cannot force them to leave.

59:01.910 --> 59:03.330
Why not?

59:03.410 --> 59:06.500
But we can help them to understand...

59:06.580 --> 59:08.540
that they are not welcome.

59:16.590 --> 59:17.590
Josephine?

59:20.930 --> 59:24.850
Josephine, you think
you can just walk out on me?

59:24.930 --> 59:26.810
You stupid woman!

59:26.890 --> 59:30.350
You're nothing without me.

59:30.440 --> 59:32.560
You can't even use a skillet!

59:34.270 --> 59:36.820
Can't even put a...

59:36.900 --> 59:37.820
goddamn meal on the table.

59:37.900 --> 59:39.240
He's inside.

59:39.320 --> 59:40.700
He's here.

59:40.780 --> 59:41.860
Oh, God.

59:41.950 --> 59:43.450
I need to talk to you.

59:45.160 --> 59:46.910
Please open the door. I know—

59:47.000 --> 59:48.250
Mama!

59:48.330 --> 59:49.370
Come help me!

59:49.460 --> 59:53.960
Open the door.

59:54.040 --> 59:55.500
I just want to talk to you.

59:55.590 --> 59:57.380
Go sleep it off, Serge!

59:57.460 --> 59:59.880
You shut up, you bitch!

59:59.970 --> 01:00:02.890
You've caused enough trouble already!

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:03.930
You—

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.640
Open this door!

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.890
Mama!

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.480
- Oh, my God!
- You st—

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.360
Stay away from me.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.320
Come here now!

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.530
Why, you meddling bitch!

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.620
You—

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.640
Who says I can't use a skillet?

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.700
Bonjour, monsieur.

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:10.750
Bonjour.

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:16.790
Wonderful.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.790
Come on.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.710
Up. Come on.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.880
Up.

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:23.970
Come on.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.640
His skull can't be as thick as we thought.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:34.020
It was like swatting a fly.

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:41.820
The worst is over.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.940
He found out what you're made of.

01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:45.950
So did I.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.370
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.290
How long have we got?

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:57.210
She's at the hairdresser for an hour.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.340
Fuffi?

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.750
Fuffi.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.760
I'm so sorry, but I have
to break the appointment.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.800
Is something wrong?

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.340
No. I volunteered to distribute these.

01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:07.590
I promised the comte
I'd have them out

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.430
by the end ofthe day.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:11.510
Count me in.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.310
Not that I expect
any ofthem to stop by

01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:14.390
for a hairstyle.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.600
It's notjust that.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:16.980
The comte feels we must stand firm.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.190
We cannot trust these people.

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:21.520
Before you know it, they'll
be doingjobs for food.

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:22.610
They'll be begging at our doors.

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:24.530
Not at this door.

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.110
Good, Fuffi, good.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.030
Rub, rub, rub. Rub harder. Rub.

01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:34.250
Rub. Rub.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.000
Rub it. Hard.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.000
Keep your head still.

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.010
Bravo!

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:55.680
Hello, Caroline.

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:03.480
Ifyou want to blame someone, blame me—

01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:05.650
Corrupting him with cocoa.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.820
Oh, how dare you, Mother.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.570
He's happy. He's fine. Look at him.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:11.740
Mama, I—

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.910
Well, what about you, Mother?

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:16.250
Are you fine?

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.000
I bet she has conveniently
forgotten to tell you.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.000
Carol.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.420
Why don't you show them, Mother?

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.010
Are you afraid to? Why don't you show?

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:34.890
Insulin shots.

01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:37.100
She has diabetes- very advanced.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:39.230
She could be blind within a year.

01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:41.400
Yeah. Couldn't you call me a drug addict?

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.480
It sounds a lot more glamorous.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:45.150
And you—

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:46.730
You sit here feeding her sweets.

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:49.780
There are worse ways to die.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.780
Why don't you just give her rat poison?

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.120
It would be faster.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.280
Carol has a flair for drama.

01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:56.910
She needs to be in a place

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.660
where she can be taken care of.

01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:01.210
Le mortoir?

01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:03.210
I'd rather be in hell.

01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:08.050
You may get there, Mother.

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:09.420
Luc, come with me.

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:10.760
I don't want to.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.050
He's-

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.890
He's happy here. It's good for him.

01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:17.060
I will decide what is good for my son...

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.560
Madame Muscat.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.490
Give me another.

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:32.700
It's my life. Let me enjoy what's left of it.

01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.700
Fill 'er up.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.370
Armande, why didn't you tell me?

01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:40.910
Is this a chocolaterie, or is it a confessional?

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:46.750
Don't you dare pity me.

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:14.950
Sorry, we're closed.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.330
Shejust wants a soda water.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.500
I don't serve animals.

01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:31.300
Right.

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:49.980
Hello.

01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:50.980
Hi.

01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:52.610
I just made a fresh batch of monduon.

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.700
Anybody interested?

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:56.360
My tummy hurts.

01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:59.490
I've gotjust the thing for that. Come in.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.200
What about boycotting immorality, then?

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:05.250
Come in.

01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:11.500
An old remedy.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.090
From the cocoa tree.

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.670
Tastes strange.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.760
Maybe your daddy would like a taste.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.850
He's not my daddy. He's my pony.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.770
Here. It's a lot better than those leaves.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:28.770
Tastes good.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.270
Come on.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.650
Pantoufle wants to meet you.

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:34.990
He's my kangaroo.

01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:42.950
Go ahead. It's your favorite.

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:48.120
What makes you so sure?

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:49.960
Go on. Taste it.

01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:57.470
That's fantastic.

01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:58.800
Oh, thanks.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.390
I have a knack for guessing.

01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:02.970
It's good— not my favorite.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.010
Sorry?

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.150
All right.

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:11.980
Thanks very much.

01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:20.610
You know, I could fix that, ifyou like.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.620
Not with glass, but...

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.280
I can make you a nice strong one out ofwood.

01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:26.160
That's nice ofyou...

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.750
but I insist on paying you foryour work.

01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:31.670
Well, that makes 2 of us, then.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.920
Bye.

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:37.590
Thanks again.

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.430
She's laughing at us.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.810
Now she's got one
ofthose river people

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:49.230
working for her.

01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:50.230
Is that a problem?

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:51.810
After all, Christ teaches us—

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.810
Look at this.

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.480
She's soliciting for stalls

01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:56.780
and street performers

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.190
for a fertility celebration

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.150
on Easter Sunday.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.070
She's cackling at us.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.320
When are you going to do something about it?

01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:05.450
Oh, there.

01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:09.500
What part ofAustralia

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.830
is Pantoufle from?

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:11.920
A small town

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.460
outside ofSydney.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.710
What does he eat?

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.460
Leaves...

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:19.590
bugs...

01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:21.930
and worms, ofcourse.

01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:23.970
What about chocolate?

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:26.310
Kangaroos don't eat chocolate.

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:27.970
Has he ever tried it?

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.520
Have you ever tried chocolate?

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.270
He's not interested.

01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:37.069
Not interested?

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:39.529
Mr. Pantoufle, you surprise me.

01:08:39.609 --> 01:08:41.029
A world traveler
such as yourself

01:08:41.109 --> 01:08:42.609
not interested in new flavors?

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.109
You should be ashamed.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.580
I have a very nice truffle here

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:48.740
if he wants to try it.

01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:50.750
You are wasting your time.

01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:52.620
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.920
How do you know
you don't like chocolate

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.460
ifyou refuse to try it?

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:58.630
Do you like worms?

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.760
What?

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.680
How do you know ifyou've never tasted one?

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:27.319
Subtle.

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:30.240
Zesty.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:34.580
Disgusting.

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:43.880
Go on, my little friend.

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:45.130
Be free.

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.800
You tricked me.

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.220
Satan...

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:51.220
wears many guises.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.100
At times, Satan is
the singer ofa lurid song

01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:58.310
you hear on the radio.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.570
At times...

01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:03.110
the author ofa salacious novel.

01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:06.780
At times, the quiet man
lurking in the schoolyard

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.490
asking your children

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:11.660
if he mightjoin their game.

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.200
And at times...

01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:15.960
the maker ofsweet things-

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.420
mere trifles.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.500
Forwhat could seem more harmless...

01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:22.250
more innocent...

01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:24.630
than chocolate?

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:31.510
A bit ofa squeak.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.520
Hey...

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.190
Guillaume!

01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:38.310
I've got something new

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.480
Charlie's going to love.

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.940
Come on, Charlie. Come on.

01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:49.030
It's me. I should go.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.280
No, it's not you. It's-

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.290
Where have you been?

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:55.700
I was worried.

01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:57.370
Hey! I'm talking to you.

01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:00.330
It'sjust like all the other towns.

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:06.670
Anouk.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.260
Just tell me what happened.

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.300
Are you Satan's helper?

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:16.430
Well, it's not easy being different.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.190
Why can't we go to church?

01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:22.480
Well, you can ifyou want...

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:24.360
but it won't make things easier.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.280
Why can't you wear black shoes

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.280
like the other mothers?

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:34.580
He's a fine piece ofwork...

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:36.830
our little nobleman.

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:39.160
No wonder his wife goes gallivanting off.

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:40.170
She's been in Italy for months.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:41.000
Did you know that?

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.130
Armande...

01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:46.420
the whole town's against me.

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:49.760
What can I do?

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.470
Throw me a party.

01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:54.100
What?

01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:56.810
Wednesday's my 70th.

01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:58.100
Let's show the bastards

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.850
we're ready to go down dancing.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.190
Well...

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:06.690
but a party?

01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:11.280
You're not well. You have to face it.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.830
Ok, ok, ok...

01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:17.790
But you do this for me,
and I promise

01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:19.580
I'll check into le mortoir
the very next morning

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:22.210
without a care in the world.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.550
If I threw a party in this town...

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:30.220
no one would come.

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.680
They don't need to know who's throwing it.

01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:37.260
Armande, listen, I—

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:39.770
No, no, no. You listen.

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:43.440
I need this.

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:53.950
When I need help, I ask for it.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.760
Boys, bring me some more wood.

01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:28.020
My mother
used to sing that song

01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:30.780
when I couldn't sleep.

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:32.530
And did it help?

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:39.620
I still didn't sleep, but, yes, yes, it helped.

01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:44.210
How's the door?

01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:46.040
It squeaks.

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:47.210
Does it?

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:50.460
How's Anouk? Is she well?

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:52.260
Oh, she's better. She's fine.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:54.300
Good. How are you?

01:13:56.050 --> 01:13:58.220
I'm throwing a party...

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.600
ifanyone shows up.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680
Thanks.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.730
Who's invited?

01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:07.730
A bunch oftownspeople.

01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:11.440
Tell me something.
Why do you give a damn about

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.490
what these narrow-minded villagers think?

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:18.070
You're not scared ofthem, are you?

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.990
Coming to the party or not?

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.330
I can't.

01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:26.540
There's a boycott against immorality...

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:28.630
and I must respect that.

01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:30.630
That is a problem.

01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:32.920
Well, then, I'll leave you
with this test

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:34.880
ofyour convictions.

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:35.880
What is that?

01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:38.260
Your favorite.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.550
My favorite?

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.680
Is that right?

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.600
- Thankyou.
- You're welcome.

01:14:52.230 --> 01:14:53.940
I'm undone—

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:56.190
But not my favorite.

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.160
I'll come round sometime...

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.790
get that squeak out ofyour door.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.200
A lot foryou.

01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:30.040
You see?

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:43.970
Bon appetit, everyonee

01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:02.320
Ifthe comte finds out...

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:04.990
The comte isn't here. He wasn't invited.

01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:07.830
Is Luc coming?

01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:13.830
I'm sure they have other plans.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.750
Luc?

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.340
Why are you sleeping?

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:30.180
Are you not feeling well?

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:49.330
Happy birthday, Grandmama.

01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:55.460
The invitation said 5:00.

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.840
I should have read it more closely.

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.090
Ifyou had, you'd know

01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:03.970
there was supposed to be no gifts.

01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:06.680
Don't worry so much about the "supposed to."

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.220
Like it?

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.150
You made me younger.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.650
Very diplomatic.

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:19.580
I have 2 announcements.

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.670
Number one- ifyou like what you tasted here...

01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:25.880
you're going to love
my chocolate festival

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.050
on Sunday.

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:29.880
Advertise on your own time.

01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:31.760
What's for dessert?

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:34.510
That brings me to number 2.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.930
It is my duty to announce

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.520
that there is no dessert here tonight.

01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:42.230
No dessert?

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:44.940
Because it's on Roux's boat.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.530
Any complaints, see me.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.820
Monsieur le Comte?

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:14.160
Who's there?

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.410
I must speak to you.

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.050
You see, Monsieur le Comte?

01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:35.510
You see?

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:38.220
There'sJosephine, that stupid cow.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.190
Something must be done, Serge.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.520
Something must be done.

01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:18.550
You done yet?

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.390
Almost.

01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:21.600
Almost?

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.890
Come on, leave it. You're done.

01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:27.440
Come with me.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.480
Come on.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.530
I have chocolates...

01:22:35.610 --> 01:22:36.570
Chocolate everywhere.

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:37.780
What? You're all right.

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.160
Do you think everyone had a good time?

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.320
I'm tired.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.240
Vianne, Roux.

01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:02.660
Thanks.

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.160
This was...

01:24:07.290 --> 01:24:08.750
Thankyou.

01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:14.750
I'll take you home.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.090
Oh, for God's sake, don't fuss.

01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:20.970
You'll ruin a perfectly decadent evening.

01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:23.090
I'm not partial to big, sloppy good-byes.

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.510
Armande.

01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:38.070
I'll take care ofthe dishes.

01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:41.900
I think I'll sleep in my chair tonight.

01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:22.610
Do you like it?

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.570
Taking your home with you

01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:27.450
whereveryou go?

01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:29.160
Yeah. Why not?

01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:31.790
Yourway must be harder-

01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:37.290
Each time having to make
a new home from scratch.

01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:40.590
Well, maybe this time I'll get it right.

01:25:40.670 --> 01:25:42.300
What do you mean?

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.840
Maybe I'll stay.

01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:47.550
What?

01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.310
Don't you ever think about

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.730
belonging somewhere?

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:02.780
The price is too high.

01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:05.150
You end up caring what people expect ofyou.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.410
No.

01:26:06.490 --> 01:26:08.450
Is that so terrible?

01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:12.660
Having people expect something ofyou?

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.670
How does Anouk feel about it?

01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:21.710
What?

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.840
All the moving around.

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.090
No, she's fine.

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:29.470
She handles it beautifully.

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.430
She makes friends easily.

01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:36.890
She has such an unusual...

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:48.360
She hates it.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.510
Vianne.

01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:29.510
Vianne, come on.

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:32.640
Come on.

01:28:50.490 --> 01:28:52.360
Get 'em out of here!

01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.660
We need more! Hurry up!

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:57.830
Anouk!

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.710
Mommy!

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:13.180
Anouk!

01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:28.230
No!

01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:31.860
Jesus!

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.740
Come back!

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.000
Anouk!

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.620
Come back, Vianne!

01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:49.250
Anouk!

01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:54.180
- Stop!
- No!

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:55.220
No!

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:56.590
- No!
- Stop it!

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:59.510
Stop it!

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:00.680
- Come back!
- No!

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.200
No!

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.780
Come on!

01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:50.480
Why did you stop me?

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:52.190
It was too late.

01:30:55.490 --> 01:30:57.150
Mom!

01:31:01.330 --> 01:31:03.740
There she is.

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:05.370
Oh, my God, there she is!

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:06.580
Mama!

01:31:07.670 --> 01:31:09.080
Anouska!

01:31:09.170 --> 01:31:10.080
I'm coming!

01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:12.130
Oh, my God.

01:31:17.130 --> 01:31:18.550
You're hurting me.

01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:30.230
Oh, my God.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:32.120
I just wanted to make sure that...

01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:33.670
Yes, we're ok.

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.800
You?

01:32:41.010 --> 01:32:42.890
And I...

01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:44.260
came to say...

01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:47.770
To say good-bye. Yes, I know.

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:54.770
What?

01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.440
Your boat.

01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.530
You've lost your home.

01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:04.110
No.

01:33:05.370 --> 01:33:08.120
Just a way to get from place to place, really.

01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:13.000
So, how will you...

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.920
I'll manage.

01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:34.560
Well...

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.150
Vianne...

01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.530
Listen, I...

01:33:43.610 --> 01:33:45.570
I know. I'm sorry.

01:33:48.330 --> 01:33:49.790
I'm sorry.

01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:05.260
Your papa

01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:09.140
used to ride this bike every single morning.

01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:11.220
He would have wanted you to have it.

01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:13.100
Just you promise me

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.940
that you'll never run away again, ok?

01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:16.480
Mama, she...

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:18.860
What?

01:34:20.190 --> 01:34:22.400
What's wrong, Luc?

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:28.620
Though we cannot know

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:30.870
Armande Voizin's last thoughts...

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.250
we can hope they were thoughts

01:34:33.330 --> 01:34:35.660
of penitence.

01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:38.290
We can hope
she asked God

01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:41.550
to forgive the self-indulgence

01:34:41.630 --> 01:34:43.170
that aggravated her illness

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:44.800
and caused her death...

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.220
And we can pause to reexamine our own lives.

01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:51.310
We can resist those

01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:54.480
who would lead us into temptation.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.110
Blessed is the one who endures temptation...

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.740
forwhen he has stood the test...

01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:34.260
Mama...

01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:37.230
can we go home now?

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:03.250
Ofcourse.

01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:09.300
Whateveryou like, Mama.

01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:11.970
Vianne, did you want me

01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:15.060
to start the knish for the festival?

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:17.520
Vianne?

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.520
Did you—

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.860
What are you doing?

01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.820
Leaving.

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.150
First thing in the morning.

01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:41.580
Is it because ofArmande?

01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:43.500
It was not your fault.

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.210
It's time, that's all.

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.170
This is who I am.

01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.270
Did you believe anything you told me?

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:04.310
Did you believe I could be better?

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.520
Was it all a joke?

01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:19.120
I have to pack now.

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:25.080
Ifyou leave,
everything will go back

01:37:25.170 --> 01:37:27.040
to the way it always was.

01:37:27.130 --> 01:37:29.550
It is the way it always was.

01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:34.220
Not for me.

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:41.810
I know howyou feel.

01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:43.560
Beg your pardon?

01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:49.270
I suppose it can't be easy

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.610
having her gone.

01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:55.490
Can't seem to get used to it...

01:37:55.570 --> 01:37:57.240
no matter how much time.

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:04.160
But I...

01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:06.540
look forward to her return.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.090
I don't believe anyone
would think less ofyou...

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.760
Ifyou were to say she was never coming back.

01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:24.140
Good night, Paul.

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:38.570
Caroline!

01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:41.540
I'm sorry.

01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:46.290
I need to talk to you.

01:38:54.170 --> 01:38:55.130
Come in.

01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:57.800
Monsieur Comte.

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.550
It's all right.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:06.270
Sorry to botheryou, Monsieur le Comte.

01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:07.310
All right.

01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:13.150
It was the right thing to do, wasn't it?

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:17.400
Ofcourse it was. I know it was.

01:39:17.490 --> 01:39:20.570
It's everything with Josephine.

01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:21.580
Serge...

01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:22.580
This...

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:23.870
What are you talking about?

01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:25.120
The fire, Monsieur le Comte.

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.120
I know it was the right thing to do...

01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:30.380
but I can't get rid of

01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:32.590
the faces and the screams.

01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:34.130
The fire...

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:38.180
The fire was an act ofGod.

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:42.140
It was me, Monsieur le Comte.

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.310
What?

01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:48.600
You told me.

01:39:48.690 --> 01:39:51.310
Remember?

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.820
You said, "Something has to be done, Serge."

01:39:57.490 --> 01:39:59.200
You did, didn't you?

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:08.870
People could have died.

01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:13.130
You want their blood on your hands?

01:40:13.210 --> 01:40:15.500
On my hands?

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:20.180
Should I go to Père Henri
and ask for forgiveness?

01:40:22.050 --> 01:40:23.680
Listen to me, Serge.

01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:27.100
Listen very carefully.

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:31.140
You must leave this village at once...

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.820
and never return.

01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:38.320
Why would I leave my home and my café?

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.320
Because I'm evicting you, that's why!

01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:44.030
What you have done puts
you beyond anyone's help...

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:46.370
beyond my help, anybody's help!

01:40:46.450 --> 01:40:48.250
Now get out!

01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:50.160
Unless you will tell
the police what you've done!

01:40:50.250 --> 01:40:52.580
Get out! Get out! Get out!

01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:13.440
Time to go.

01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:17.480
Oh, no.

01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:18.480
I'm not going.

01:41:18.570 --> 01:41:20.070
Well, it's hard for me, too.

01:41:20.150 --> 01:41:21.360
Pantoufle hates this.

01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:22.360
Stop that.

01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:23.700
Please put it on.

01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:24.950
I hate you.

01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:29.870
You're entitled. I said put it on.

01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:34.330
Ouch!

01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:35.540
Well, then, do it yourself!

01:41:35.630 --> 01:41:36.540
I can't!

01:41:36.630 --> 01:41:38.500
Get up.

01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:40.550
I have a bad leg like Pantoufle.

01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:41.880
Stop that. Get up.

01:41:41.970 --> 01:41:44.890
Pantoufle can't walk. I can't walk.

01:41:44.970 --> 01:41:46.220
Walk. Walk!

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:47.220
You're hurting me.

01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:48.470
Well, stop being...

01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:56.980
Let me go!

01:41:58.020 --> 01:42:00.280
No!

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.070
It's not fair!

01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:03.240
Stop it!

01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:05.530
I'm not going!

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.950
It's- Stop it!

01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:27.890
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.010
I'm sorry.

01:42:33.810 --> 01:42:35.390
Don't worry, Mama.

01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:48.490
The next town will be better...

01:42:48.570 --> 01:42:50.200
won't it, Mama?

01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:54.620
It will.

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:56.290
It will be wonderful.

01:42:58.790 --> 01:43:01.250
I'm ready to go now, ok?

01:43:42.250 --> 01:43:43.500
Is this right?

01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:46.840
No, no, you've got to cut
on the corners like this.

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.260
So,just stop them.

01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:52.430
Higher.

01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:09.450
How do you like these almonds?

01:44:13.450 --> 01:44:15.370
Are they chopped fine enough?

01:44:22.290 --> 01:44:23.920
Are they ok, Vianne?

01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:40.560
Christ is risen.

01:44:40.650 --> 01:44:42.400
My friends, let this Easter day

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.400
be for us, too, a rebirth.

01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.570
Let us strive—

01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:48.030
No, no, no.

01:44:48.110 --> 01:44:50.030
No, don't bury the word "rebirth."

01:44:50.110 --> 01:44:51.860
Let it ring out.

01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:54.570
Let this day be for us, too, a rebirth!

01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:55.910
You see, we are extolling

01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:58.410
our parishioners to resurrect

01:44:58.500 --> 01:44:59.960
their moral awareness.

01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:02.250
Ok, good, good. Try again.

01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:03.880
I think we've gone over this enough.

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:04.880
Let's call it a day.

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:05.880
What?

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:06.880
I'm very tired.

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.000
Fine, fine. Well, leave it with me.

01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:09.130
I may have one or two suggestions.

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.130
Thankyou, Monsieur le Comte—

01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:11.470
Just a couple ofsuggestions.

01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:12.840
A revision here and there.

01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:15.100
I mean, we want it
to be perfect

01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:17.350
tomorrow, don't we?

01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:19.140
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:45:24.190 --> 01:45:25.980
We must resist—

01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:28.780
We must resist the shallow,
worldly temptations

01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:29.900
ofour mortal— No, no.

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:33.450
We must renounce shallow,
worldly temptations

01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:34.570
ofour mortal flesh.

01:45:41.710 --> 01:45:43.000
Caroline.

01:45:48.710 --> 01:45:51.590
All my efforts have been for nothing.

01:45:51.670 --> 01:45:54.800
I've suffered willingly.

01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:56.640
I've fasted.

01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.060
I've hardly eaten for weeks now.

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:00.390
I'm sorry.

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:04.270
I'm sorry, my suffering is nothing.

01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:08.310
It'sjust that I feel so lost.

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:10.360
I don't know what to do.

01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:14.490
Tell me what to do.

01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:53.210
Drink this.

01:49:53.290 --> 01:49:54.620
It'll refresh you.

01:49:54.710 --> 01:49:55.830
I promise.

01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.250
Go ahead, drink.

01:50:10.890 --> 01:50:12.350
I'm so sorry.

01:50:13.890 --> 01:50:16.770
I won't tell a soul.

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.860
Better get cleaned up.

01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:24.860
Easter Sunday.

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:27.530
The sermon.

01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:34.370
I didn't finish it.

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:37.130
I'll think ofsomething.

01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:51.810
I'm not sure

01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:54.850
what the theme of my homily today ought to be.

01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:00.440
Do I want
to speak ofthe miracle

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:04.240
ofour Lord's divine transformation?

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:07.110
Not really, no.

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:11.030
I don't want to talk about his divinity.

01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:16.750
I'd rather talk about his humanity.

01:51:16.830 --> 01:51:18.290
I mean, you know...

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.290
how he lived his life here on earth.

01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:23.880
His kindness.

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:26.220
His tolerance.

01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:29.010
Listen, here's what I think.

01:51:29.090 --> 01:51:31.220
I think we can't go around

01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:35.600
measuring our goodness by what we don't do.

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:38.060
By what we deny ourselves...

01:51:38.150 --> 01:51:39.520
what we resist...

01:51:39.610 --> 01:51:41.730
and who we exclude.

01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:46.740
I think we've got
to measure goodness

01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:49.410
by what we embrace...

01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:52.660
what we create...

01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:54.740
and who we include.

01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:02.290
It was certainly not

01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:05.800
the most fiery sermon
Père Henri would ever preach...

01:52:07.670 --> 01:52:09.800
Nor the most eloquent.

01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:13.100
But the parishioners

01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:16.680
felt a new sensation that day.

01:52:16.770 --> 01:52:19.480
A lightening ofthe spirit.

01:52:21.610 --> 01:52:25.150
A freedom from the old tranquilite.

01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:54.800
Fantastic!

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.730
Thankyou.

01:53:01.810 --> 01:53:03.400
Even the Comte de Reynaud

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:06.520
felt strangely...

01:53:06.610 --> 01:53:07.860
released.

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:15.240
Although, it would take
another 6 months

01:53:15.330 --> 01:53:18.830
before he'd work up the nerve
to ask Caroline out to dinner.

01:53:38.930 --> 01:53:41.430
As forJosephine...

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:45.650
she took over the lease
at the old café

01:53:45.730 --> 01:53:47.480
and gave it a new name.

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.580
But still the clever north wind

01:54:05.670 --> 01:54:07.750
was not satisfied.

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.480
The wind spoke to Vianne

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:24.810
oftowns yet to be visited.

01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:30.780
Friends in need, yet to be discovered.

01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:35.860
Battles yet to be fought.

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.790
By someone else... next time.

01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:02.350
And so it was,
the north wind grew weary

01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:05.640
and went on its way.

01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:07.980
When summer came to the little village...

01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:12.110
a new breeze from the south blew soft and warm.

01:55:17.490 --> 01:55:19.320
Just needed an adjustment.

01:55:19.410 --> 01:55:20.990
Hope it'll be better now.

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:24.370
Roux!

01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:26.250
My mother knew Roux's return

01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:29.130
had nothing to do with a silly old door.

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:33.300
So did I.

01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:38.840
I thought you'd never guess.

01:55:38.930 --> 01:55:40.800
My favorite, hot chocolate.

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:45.100
I knew that.

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:55.480
As for Pantoufle?

01:55:58.110 --> 01:56:00.360
Well, his bad leg

01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:03.080
miraculously healed...

01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:06.330
and he hopped off in search of new adventures.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.080
I didn't miss him.
