33:47.150 --> 33:51.404
the hard, mean,
hard, relenting flame

33:51.404 --> 33:55.867
that keeps their hearths warm
while another grows cold,

33:55.867 --> 34:00.246
their grain stashed
while another goes hungry.

34:00.246 --> 34:05.251

34:23.770 --> 34:28.107
Oh, yes, he-- he gave away
a few million of his billions,

34:28.107 --> 34:30.318
but he was not a generous man.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.236
He was mean,

34:32.236 --> 34:35.782
and he made but a mean
estimation of the world.

34:37.241 --> 34:40.703
And he fed a certain kind
of meagerness in men.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.749
Perhaps he had to,

34:44.749 --> 34:46.834
because he had
a meagerness about him...

34:49.378 --> 34:51.172
and maybe I do about me, too.

I try.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.186
I don't know when...

35:06.604 --> 35:10.608
but some time, he decided
not to try anymore.

No, no, the thing was,

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:28.166
whatever our frictions,

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:31.586
there was an ideological
sympathy with your dad.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:36.299
Uh... My dad had deep ocean
currents swirling in his gut,

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.468
but I think on specifics,

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:42.055
he was about money,
winning, and gossip.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.140

and in terms of, um,

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.142

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:49.062

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.521
whatever, um...

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:53.232

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:58.946

how it works, okay?

01:00:58.946 --> 01:01:02.200

a very small number of people

in that space.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:08.456

Can I just say that,

that I'm interested in,

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:38.277
