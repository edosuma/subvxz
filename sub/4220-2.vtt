WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.503
Coming back to 51?

00:03.587 --> 00:05.505
Nothing but misery
and heartbreak there.

00:06.215 --> 00:09.092
Come on, Shay.
Fight for me, Shay.
Come on, Shay!

00:10.344 --> 00:11.469
Gabriela Dawson?

00:11.553 --> 00:14.263
Sylvie Brett.
I'm your new
paramedic on 61.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.766
I got a lead on your
paternal grandfather.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.518
He's living
outside of Chicago.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.602
Um, wow.

00:19.937 --> 00:23.189
Our past experience
with a female firefighter
wasn't real positive.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.025
He's not gonna
break me, Matt.
I can promise you that.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.735
I can't stay here, man.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.487
Why don't you stay
with us for a while?

00:36.453 --> 00:38.788
Hey, come on in.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.584
Hey, Kelly.
Hey! Wow, uh...

00:43.961 --> 00:45.086
New place is nice.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.254
Ah.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.297
Come on.
Guest bedroom's
this way.

00:50.634 --> 00:51.968
Hey, uh...

00:52.052 --> 00:53.094
thanks for this.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.054
Yeah, no worries.
Glad you're here.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.977
Yeah. So, uh,
here's your room, and
spare sheets and blankets.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.396
Uh, thanks.
This is just for
a little while.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.480
Long as you need.

01:09.737 --> 01:10.903
All right,
I'll see you after work?

01:10.988 --> 01:11.988
Yeah.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.073
It's good he's here.

01:14.158 --> 01:16.451
Makes all the difference,
when he has someone to
talk to.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.578
Mmm-hmm.
Or drink beer with.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.329
Uh-uh. Hands off.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.677
Hey, guys.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.638
What's this?

01:37.848 --> 01:39.056
Zombie Dust Pale Ale.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.601
I got it when the
distributor came by my bar.

01:41.685 --> 01:42.810
Thought I'd pass
it on to you guys.

01:42.895 --> 01:43.978
Why?

01:46.231 --> 01:48.524
To be honest, I'm just
trying to kiss some ass.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.360
'Cause, uh, Chief Boden
put my paperwork through,

01:51.445 --> 01:53.821
and I will be starting
here at 105, next rotation.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.656
So I'll see you
in two weeks.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.992
All right,
you were honest,
so I'll return the favor.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.578
If nobody here
is jumping for joy,

02:00.829 --> 02:03.790
it's 'cause the last
candidate we had, there
was a little hazing.

02:04.041 --> 02:07.794
She got up in arms about it.
Caused some serious problems.

02:08.378 --> 02:12.298
Huh. I've worked at a
firehouse a long time...

02:12.382 --> 02:13.382
Bring it on.

02:20.516 --> 02:21.808
Top shelf.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.227
Yep. Well, enjoy.

02:25.354 --> 02:26.813
See you soon.

02:37.407 --> 02:40.201
If the doctor is concerned,
we should be able to get
an appointment sooner.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.703
Well, then you
let me talk to her.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.539
Donna.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.082
All right, fine.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.669
If you think that's best.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.255
Uh, I'll...

02:54.132 --> 02:57.635
I'll check in on you later.
Yeah. Love you.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.097
Hey, Chief.
Kelly.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.474
How you doing?

03:03.559 --> 03:04.642
I'm good, thanks.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.645
You ready
to be back at work?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.605
If I wasn't,
I wouldn't be here.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.073
Kelly, listen.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.117
You do know
that there is grief
counseling available?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.451
I'm good.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.791
Ambulance 61, Truck 81,
Squad 3.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.793
Boat Accident,
22nd and Canal.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.008
Hey, look who finally
came down from the
mountain.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.302
Oh, I've never
seen him before!

03:39.386 --> 03:41.304
Are you sure you
remember how to do
your job, Lieutenant?

03:41.638 --> 03:43.472
Forgetting is better
than never knowing,
Capp.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.640
Oh!

03:44.725 --> 03:46.058
All right.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.373
This way!
Right this way, come on!
Help us!

04:13.211 --> 04:15.296
Oh! Help!
Oh, please save them!

04:15.923 --> 04:18.090
Augie! Augie!
Hold on, honey.
Hold on!

04:18.175 --> 04:19.342
Stand back, ma'am.
Give us some room.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.468
It's all my fault.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.011
I left the truck in drive.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.679
You have to give us
room, so we can lift
this trailer up.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.183
You don't understand.
My daughter is in there!
My daughter!

04:28.185 --> 04:30.269
Help! Help me!

04:30.354 --> 04:31.604
What's your
daughter's name?

04:31.688 --> 04:32.688
Elena.

04:33.398 --> 04:37.693
Elena, some firefighters
are on their way.
Stay as still as you can.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.945
Okay!
Mills!

04:39.029 --> 04:40.655
Wrap a sling
around this frame.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.448
Capp, get the
winch cable ready.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.075
Let's go!

04:44.743 --> 04:45.743
All right,
chop, chop!

04:48.538 --> 04:50.998
All right,
Tony, take the winch
cable back slowly

04:51.083 --> 04:52.750
until we get some
tension in the line.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.004
Okay, we're good, Casey.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.547
All right, Cruz, let's go.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.224
I'm through!

05:09.601 --> 05:11.227
One, two, three.
Ah!

05:11.311 --> 05:13.062
Watch his head.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.402
Let's get him
to the ambulance.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.571
Elena, we're coming
down to get you!

05:22.656 --> 05:23.864
Down on Severide.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.282
All right, down.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.536
Down on Newhouse.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.080
All right, all right!

05:32.374 --> 05:34.875
Newhouse, see if you can
kill the engine without
moving the truck.

05:34.960 --> 05:35.960
All right.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.381
Okay, Elena, I know
you're scared, but I need
you to trust me, okay?

05:40.507 --> 05:41.882
Okay.
Okay?

05:41.925 --> 05:44.260
Can you lock eyes
with me? You good?
Uh-huh.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.804
That's good.
Slowly give me
your right arm.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.266
That's good, real good.
Okay, work your way up.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.769
You're doing great.
I want you to lunge
into my arms, okay?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.062
Okay.
Okay, ready?

05:55.147 --> 05:56.772
One, two, three.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.608
Haul up!

05:59.776 --> 06:01.610
All right, nice work.
You're doing great.

06:04.573 --> 06:05.614
All right.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.533
Mom! Mom!

06:09.286 --> 06:10.453
Elena!

06:10.954 --> 06:12.538
Welcome back,
Lieutenant.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.473
Most of the people you tracked
down at your second job

06:30.557 --> 06:31.849
aren't too happy
to see you, huh?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.017
Nope.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.728
What about, um,
long-lost family members?

06:35.812 --> 06:37.271
How does that
usually turn out?

06:37.814 --> 06:38.814
Well, I guess it
would depend on

06:38.899 --> 06:40.191
why they're long lost
to begin with.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.070
Got my daughter
a cell phone,

06:44.154 --> 06:46.113
now she's calling
me every five minutes.

06:54.915 --> 06:55.956
Hey, Lieutenant.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.459
I just wanted to formally
introduce myself.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.294
I'm Sylvie Brett.
Kelly Severide.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.880
Yeah, I've...
I've heard a lot about you.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.966
Um, I just want
you to know I'm...

07:06.051 --> 07:08.636
I'm really honored
to be on Ambo 61.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.764
Uh-huh.
Well, welcome aboard.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.436
The more I think about it,

07:17.521 --> 07:18.854
the more I like the idea

07:18.939 --> 07:21.148
of you two guys
getting in on Molly's Two.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.401
Terrific!
All right.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.863
Now, I got an idea how
to convince the partners,

07:28.490 --> 07:29.615
mainly me,

07:29.699 --> 07:32.618
and it came from this
show that Cindy and I
used to love to watch,

07:32.702 --> 07:33.994
The Apprentice.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.538
You're fired!

07:35.872 --> 07:38.499
Right.
So, how about this?

07:38.917 --> 07:42.044
I give you and Cruz the rights
to the name Molly's Two,

07:42.129 --> 07:44.588
and you guys have to
come up with a way

07:44.965 --> 07:46.882
to make money
using that name.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.592
Like a try-out?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.386
Like a challenge.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.513
Works for me.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.850
Let's do this.

07:56.893 --> 07:57.893
You're on.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.607
It's gonna be very weird,
leaving here.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.403
I'm ready for this, right?
I can do this.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.487
I'm ready for Austin.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.072
You're more than ready.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.746
Bet the first thing Welch puts
you through as a candidate,

08:18.373 --> 08:19.373
stair drills.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.791
You think?
Mmm-hmm.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.669
How about a training session
tomorrow after shift?

08:23.753 --> 08:24.920
Sure. I mean, I did...

08:25.088 --> 08:27.047
pretty well on stairs
all through Academy, but...

08:27.132 --> 08:28.424
Yeah, but...

08:28.550 --> 08:29.550
Yeah, I'm always up
for more training.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.260
Good.

08:37.601 --> 08:38.642
Hey.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.438
Glad you called.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.607
I, uh...

08:44.774 --> 08:46.066
I went off the
grid for a while,

08:46.276 --> 08:47.526
I didn't reach out
to anybody.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.945
You don't have
to explain anything.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.782
Kelly, I'm so
sorry about Shay.

08:54.409 --> 08:55.868
Yeah, thanks.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.287
How are you
holding up?
I'm good.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.249
I just wanted to
let you know that
I was back in town.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.379
Maybe you wanna get
together some time?

09:08.965 --> 09:10.799
You wanna grab a
drink after shift?

09:11.426 --> 09:13.135
Uh, I can't tonight.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.430
I told Capp and some of
the guys that I was gonna
get together with them, but...

09:16.806 --> 09:18.557
All right.
Soon.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.226
You just let me know.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.686
I gotta head back.

10:03.687 --> 10:04.853
Can I help you?

10:05.021 --> 10:07.690
Um, yeah.
Uh, maybe you can, uh...

10:09.859 --> 10:11.026
So, what do you want?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.736
I'm looking for
a Leonard Mills.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.698
Cody! Lock Digger
in your sister's room.

10:19.661 --> 10:20.869
Go ahead.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.871
I'm Peter Mills.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.541
Uh, Leonard is
my grandfather.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.128
What are you
talking about?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.088
Henry Mills is my dad.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.466
You got the paperwork
to prove that?

10:36.219 --> 10:37.886
No.
No, not on me.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.057
I just wanna talk to
Leonard, if he's here.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.392
He's not.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.979
Look, I'm telling the truth.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.565
But if you want
to check it out,
be my guest.

10:50.692 --> 10:51.734
Just, um...

10:52.444 --> 10:54.903
give my information
to Leonard,
tell him I came by.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.117
Thank you.

11:06.333 --> 11:10.002
Here's the drill.
I want you to hustle up
those stairs to the roof,

11:10.086 --> 11:13.339
grab the roll of hose,
bring it back down,
fast but secure.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.757
I'll be timing.

11:14.841 --> 11:15.924
Okay.
All right?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.217
Got it.
Ready?

11:17.385 --> 11:18.427
Go.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.472
Let's go, let's go!
Move it!

11:43.620 --> 11:44.995
Oh, my God.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.764
Gabby,

12:05.809 --> 12:07.810
will you marry me?
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.481
Morning.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.943
Check it out.
Some crazy guy proposed
to me last night.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.069
Mmm, really?

12:59.195 --> 13:00.446
Mmm-hmm.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.239
Hope you took some
time to think about it.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.365
Hmm.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.578
Mmm.
Oh, my God.
What?

13:07.662 --> 13:10.122
There is no way that
Severide didn't hear
us last night.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.375
Oh, he didn't.
He never came home.
Bed wasn't slept in.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.753
Well...
Do you think he's...
Do you think he's okay?

13:17.464 --> 13:20.716
He said something
about, uh, meeting
Lindsay yesterday.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.593
Probably stayed
at her place.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.429
I'm really glad...
I'm really glad that
that's still a thing.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.805
So he doesn't have to...

13:28.391 --> 13:30.267
Deal with everything solo.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.146
Hmm.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.150
I'm sorry.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.237
I'm sorry,
it's just, um...

13:43.072 --> 13:47.784
It's just nuts,
the way this wave of it
just suddenly hits me.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.369
Hey, hey.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.290
You gotta talk to
me when that happens.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.585
What do you think
this thing's about?

13:56.961 --> 13:58.837
It's not just
the free sex, lady.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.717
Okay.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.887
Well it's just, the thing is,

14:08.431 --> 14:09.932
this morning,
when I woke up,

14:11.643 --> 14:15.437
my first thought was,
"I can't wait to tell
Shay."

14:19.234 --> 14:21.693
She helped me
buy the ring.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.738
She was really
happy for us.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.787
Yeah.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.542
Hey.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.879
Hey, who we got here?

14:40.964 --> 14:42.047
Uh, this is my daughter.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.674
Naomi.
Nice to meet you.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.801
Hey. Christopher.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.053
Glad to have someone
with manners in the house.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.639
Hey, baby,
go do your homework,
okay?

14:52.850 --> 14:54.935
Chief. My daughter's
school is off this week,

14:55.019 --> 14:56.979
so she's gonna be hanging
out here, if that's cool.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.315
She's been around firehouses.
She knows how to stay out
of the way.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.068
Well, I hope so.
This is a workplace.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.075
Don't worry,
he'll be fine with it.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.244
Something's been going on
with him the last few days.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.371
Yeah.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.839
Looks like you and Lindsay
had a late night.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.632
Something like that.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.053
Hey, um, what happened
at the Academy?

15:32.056 --> 15:34.016
Me and Dawson are
officially engaged.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.642
Ah!

15:35.727 --> 15:37.311
Hey, congrats, man.
Thanks.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.062
That's great.
I'm happy for you.
Yeah.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.272
We're, uh...

15:40.356 --> 15:43.692
Yeah, we're trying keep
it on the QT till her
transfer comes through.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.611
Yeah, no, I...
I won't say a word.

15:45.695 --> 15:46.862
Thanks.

15:47.030 --> 15:51.199
What concerns me is
I don't see anybody's
nose to the grindstone.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.619
I made it clear
that I wanted to hear

15:53.703 --> 15:56.038
the proposal no
later than Thursday.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.041
Can we do Friday?

15:59.125 --> 16:01.501
We will be ready on time.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.587
I hope so.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.381
Or else I'll have
to reach out to other
interested parties.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.721
You gotta help me
and Mouch put this
thing together.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.640
Why would I get in
the middle of it?

16:14.724 --> 16:17.059
Uh, because you're a
Molly's owner, and you
got stake in it, too.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.186
Come on, man,
be our rabbi on this.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.898
I guess, you know,
in a purely
advisory capacity...

16:23.650 --> 16:29.696
Guys, I'm working on a
presentation that's gonna
knock Herrmann's socks off.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.865
- Yeah.
- Trust me.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.367
It's taken care of.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.248
What?

16:40.750 --> 16:43.335
It's just, you've
been smiling since

16:43.419 --> 16:45.128
we got on the
rig this morning.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.173
Casey and I got
engaged last night.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.304
Shut up!

16:54.389 --> 16:55.681
Uh-huh.
For reals?

16:56.599 --> 16:57.683
For...
For reals.

16:57.767 --> 17:02.020
I had
no idea that you were...
Wow! Congratulations!

17:02.146 --> 17:03.897
Thanks, Brett.
Yeah.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.525
We're not telling
anyone yet, since married
couples can't work together,

17:06.609 --> 17:09.111
but as soon as I get
to Austin, we'll spill.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.698
I am great with secrets,
don't worry.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.658
Main to 61. Truck 81.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.119
Man down, corner
of Ashland and 17th.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.037
I know exactly
where that is.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.424
I live right over there.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.384
Are you serious?
Yeah.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.012
What do we got?

17:36.514 --> 17:39.182
He's cyanotic.
Barely breathing.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.934
Pinpoint pupils.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.145
Does anyone know
what this guy's on?

17:43.229 --> 17:45.480
Most likely heroin or Oxy.
I'm gonna prep the
Naloxone.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.399
Hey, hey, hey!
Get your hand
out of there!

17:47.483 --> 17:48.567
Don't you touch me.
Hey, hey, hey!

17:48.651 --> 17:51.069
Hey, take it easy.
Back off.
Give us some space.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.241
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, what's in the needle?

17:56.325 --> 17:58.368
Give me some space or
this guy's gonna die.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.291
Hey! Beat it!

18:12.842 --> 18:14.092
What the hell?

18:14.177 --> 18:15.886
You're all right.
We gave you a
shot of Naloxone.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.346
Hold up.
What?

18:19.056 --> 18:20.807
Oh, man!

18:20.892 --> 18:22.893
I want my high back.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.978
All right, okay,
let's go to the hospital
and get you checked out.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.354
Let's go, come on.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.154
Well, I'm certainly
not gonna chase him down.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.659
You really
live around here?

18:50.213 --> 18:53.089
The landlord just wanted
one month's rent for a
security deposit,

18:53.174 --> 18:54.966
which was key for me.

18:58.554 --> 19:03.058
Hey, Hector. Do me a
favor and don't urinate
in the entryway anymore.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.142
Use the alley.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.561
Okay.
Thanks.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.817
Come on, Brett,
you can't live here.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.448
Oh, this is great.

19:18.741 --> 19:19.908
Right?
Yeah.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.993
Hardwood floors,
original detailing.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.745
Come on,
I'll give you the tour.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.043
Wow, you must, uh...

19:30.419 --> 19:32.337
You must really
trust your neighbors.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.840
I still need to set up
a checking account here.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.592
Come and see the kitchen.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.934
Casey, Dawson, can I
talk to you two, please?

19:50.606 --> 19:52.983
Chief Tiberg of CFD
Headquarters just called.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.151
Wants to see you
after shift.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.362
You're getting
your shield.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.823
Wait, now? I thought
that was happening
in two weeks!

19:59.907 --> 20:02.033
Well, maybe he's pushing
your start date up, so...

20:02.118 --> 20:04.119
Go get 'em.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.465
Hey, Lieutenant.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.810
Hey, Chief Tiberg.
Good to see you.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.770
Good to see you, Dawson.
Have a seat.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.653
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.156
The transfer to 105
didn't go through.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.243
What?

20:45.328 --> 20:46.870
There's nothing
personal about this,

20:47.580 --> 20:49.331
but 105 has filled
their candidate slot.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.208
I don't understand.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.377
I was told that they were
holding the slot for me.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.671
Apparently, they found
somebody they felt
was a better fit.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.843
Let me guess.
A guy.

21:03.054 --> 21:06.139
The department does not
permit gender to be a
part of these decisions.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.350
Lieutenant Welch
is well aware of that.

21:09.352 --> 21:10.977
As long as there
are no problems,

21:11.270 --> 21:14.773
your hat will go back
into the ring for a candidate
position somewhere else.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.192
Are there
any problems?

21:19.320 --> 21:20.528
No, sir.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.821
Good.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.451
But you should know
it might be some time
before a slot opens up.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.579
I understand.
Thank you, Chief.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.261
Tiberg should've told
me that this was coming.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.554
Mmm-hmm.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.557
I feel responsible.
I asked you to stay
at 51 longer...

21:49.642 --> 21:52.811
Chief, staying at 51
after losing Shay,

21:53.062 --> 21:54.813
I wouldn't have
had it any other way.

21:55.982 --> 21:59.150
The truth is, Welch was
never gonna let another
woman in that slot.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.152
You dodged a bullet,
not going to Austin.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.113
I am gonna talk to
some other chiefs.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.116
I'm gonna reach out,
shake up some trees,

22:06.200 --> 22:07.575
and maybe something
else will come up.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.577
We'll see.

22:12.081 --> 22:13.289
Thanks.
Both you guys.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.554
Uh, Lieutenant...
Can I ask you something?

22:27.638 --> 22:28.888
Yeah, what's up?

22:29.974 --> 22:32.183
How come my dad isn't
in any of these pictures?

22:32.268 --> 22:34.436
I mean, he's been
here for a while now.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.479
Uh...

22:38.149 --> 22:40.567
There he is.
Front and center.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.987
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.126
Mom?

22:59.128 --> 23:01.463
I got your message.
You went to see your
father's family?

23:02.048 --> 23:04.007
Yeah, I tried.
It wasn't the
warmest reception.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.925
I wish that you
had come to me first.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.054
Why would I do that, Ma?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.806
Every time I mention them,
you just shut me down.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.225
Well, these are not people
that you wanna know, Peter.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.563
Your father chose
to put all this
behind him years ago,

23:18.647 --> 23:20.065
why do you wanna
dredge it back up?

23:20.149 --> 23:22.233
Because, Ma,
I want to know.

23:27.573 --> 23:28.907
All right.

23:32.495 --> 23:35.413
As soon as your father's
family found out he was
marrying a black woman,

23:35.498 --> 23:36.664
they tried to stop him.

23:39.085 --> 23:43.171
Henry's parents, and the
way that they treated me,
the things that they said.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.925
I think they
were just trying to
hurt me badly enough

23:47.009 --> 23:48.635
I would run away
from your father.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.349
I'm sorry.
No, don't be.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.017
Just...

23:57.978 --> 23:59.521
Try and understand
your father and I,

23:59.605 --> 24:00.939
we didn't want
that poison

24:01.023 --> 24:02.982
anywhere near us,
or our children.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.861
Come here.

24:10.032 --> 24:11.199
I'm sorry.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.040
Daddy.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.668
Look, you promised
me you'd sleep, Omi.

24:21.752 --> 24:23.711
I will, but...

24:24.255 --> 24:26.923
I've decided
I'm not gonna go on the
D.C. trip with my class.

24:27.049 --> 24:29.509
Yeah? And when did
you decide that?

24:30.219 --> 24:31.386
Today.
Huh.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.098
Well, there's still
another couple
of months.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.558
Okay, we can think on it.

24:39.562 --> 24:43.148
Well, if I go, there
won't be anyone here
to keep an eye on you.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.483
Well, maybe I was
looking forward

24:45.568 --> 24:47.402
to a few days without
your prying eyes, huh?

24:48.195 --> 24:49.571
Yeah, right.

24:50.823 --> 24:51.906
But...

24:52.575 --> 24:55.285
If I wasn't here
to remind you to be
careful on the job,

24:56.328 --> 24:57.954
you might forget.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.082
I will never forget that.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.085
I promise.

25:07.715 --> 25:11.426
Fine, maybe I will
stick around for a bit.

25:12.303 --> 25:13.887
Move over.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.931
Suit yourself.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.404
Oh, here we go.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.448
Don't worry,
I'm not here to get
all hysterical on you.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.326
I just wanted
to let you know

25:36.410 --> 25:38.745
that you just made
the biggest mistake
of your career.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.332
Because I am a
great firefighter,

25:42.917 --> 25:44.459
and I would've
worked my ass off

25:44.543 --> 25:47.795
to make sure that
Austin became the best
damn firehouse in Chicago.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.091
But I'm gonna go do that
for another house instead.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.845
Your loss, Welch.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.810
Hey, hey! Knock it off.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.229
Hey, we're just
playing around.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.147
Hey, you know, I got...
I got a question for you.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.233
You are making a
killing on this place.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.318
You know, something
I don't understand, fill...

26:10.402 --> 26:12.237
fill the damn
snack bowls to the top.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.030
What are you doing?
Fill these things up!

26:14.573 --> 26:15.698
How many has he had?

26:15.783 --> 26:17.200
Many.
Wow.

26:17.910 --> 26:21.412
There's no pretzels.
There's just peanuts.
You could put cashews.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.082
All other kinds of treats
that you eat at the bar.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.626
There's lots of...
Hey!

26:26.710 --> 26:28.211
There she is!

26:28.671 --> 26:29.712
Hey!
Come on over.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.173
Uh, Herrmann told
me to come by, so...

26:32.341 --> 26:34.884
I bet.
Grab a seat.
Make yourself at home.

26:34.969 --> 26:37.804
Hey, Brett,
thanks for coming by.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.681
What are you, uh,
what are you drinking?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.141
Vodka and cranberry, please.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.768
No, no, that won't do.
She doesn't want that.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.187
Uh, uh...
two scotch and sodas.

26:51.485 --> 26:52.527
Wow.

26:58.575 --> 26:59.784
It's crazy, right?

27:02.913 --> 27:04.038
I mean, come on,
Herrmann,

27:04.123 --> 27:05.873
I'm not the only one
who sees it, right?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.377
See what?

27:14.258 --> 27:15.466
Herrmann, what the...

27:16.176 --> 27:18.052
I ordered some drinks!
Where are the drinks?

27:20.055 --> 27:21.597
I think you had enough.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.143
What? Come on, man.
What are you talk...
I'm not driving.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.394
Don't worry about it,
don't worry about it.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.564
I'm your friend, and
I'm telling you I think
you had too much to drink.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.399
There's people that
you work with here.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.483
What are you talk...
Her?

27:32.568 --> 27:34.152
What you talking?
I'm just busting.

27:34.236 --> 27:35.361
I'm just...
I'm just playing around.

27:35.446 --> 27:37.864
I'm just having fun!
I'm just getting to
know her.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.408
Let me, uh...
Let me find you a cab.

27:41.410 --> 27:44.078
That's funny.
That's funny. Are you guys...

27:44.330 --> 27:45.496
Are you putting me on?

27:45.581 --> 27:47.874
Guys, I'm sitting down,
I'm having a drink,
I'm enjoying myself,

27:48.042 --> 27:49.375
and now all of a sudden,
it's an intervention?

27:49.460 --> 27:50.668
- No, no, no.
- Come on.

27:50.753 --> 27:54.172
It's just your buddies
wanting to make sure
you get home safe.

27:54.256 --> 27:55.798
Come on, Kelly, let's go!

27:55.883 --> 27:57.842
You know, you know what?

27:58.385 --> 28:00.678
Brett, come on.
You and me, we're
going over to Game Day.

28:00.763 --> 28:01.804
It's at the
end of the street.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.097
We're gonna go,
we're gonna have a blast.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.682
Game Day burned down, man.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.309
Oh, yeah. Um...

28:06.935 --> 28:07.977
Town Lounge.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.441
Anybody?

28:21.825 --> 28:24.285
All right, fine.
Later.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.953
All right.

28:38.801 --> 28:40.301
How you doing, Lieutenant?

28:41.428 --> 28:42.553
Good.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.275
Hey.
Hey.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.153
Severide still
staying at your place?

28:59.738 --> 29:00.738
Yeah.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.323
Why?

29:02.658 --> 29:05.284
Ah, he was at
Molly's last night,

29:05.369 --> 29:06.953
ten sheets
to the wind.

29:07.663 --> 29:08.830
He say anything about it?

29:08.914 --> 29:10.206
No, didn't see him.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.625
Think he's been
crashing with Lindsay.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.168
Yeah.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.922
Guys on first watch
said he came in last
night, after bar time.

29:19.133 --> 29:21.926
Went to sleep
in the bunk area
until shift started.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.221
Second time this week.

29:25.431 --> 29:26.973
Hmm.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.599
I'll check
in with him.

29:28.684 --> 29:29.684
Yeah.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.394
Thanks, Herrmann.
Yeah.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.862
Guys! Heads up.

29:41.864 --> 29:45.366
Presentation
will be at Molly's,
after shift tomorrow.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.618
Sounds great.
We'll be there.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.459
Hey, we're gonna hear
that pitch first, right?

29:54.543 --> 29:58.212
Oh, um, I'd...
I'd rather keep it fresh.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.047
Fresh.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.176
No.
I'm the rabbi on this.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.677
I wanna hear
what the pitch is.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.847
All right.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.434
Fair enough.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.353
Follow me.

30:15.063 --> 30:18.649
And that is how we
will cross-pollinate,

30:18.901 --> 30:22.945
bringing these dual tracks
together to form a single,

30:23.238 --> 30:25.406
potent revenue stream,

30:26.074 --> 30:27.408
whose synergy

30:27.784 --> 30:31.996
will enhance both the status
and the financial base

30:32.080 --> 30:34.665
of the Molly's brand.

30:38.712 --> 30:41.047
I didn't understand a
damn word you just said.

30:41.590 --> 30:42.715
And I don't think
you did either.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.383
I have a glossary,
in here.

30:44.468 --> 30:45.593
Oh, the humanity.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.303
We're cooked.
Hold on a minute.

30:47.387 --> 30:49.388
What I presented was a...

30:49.473 --> 30:53.351
A blueprint for success
in any entrepren...
prenur...

30:58.315 --> 31:01.192
Herrmann worships
Donald Trump!

31:01.276 --> 31:02.401
Mouch.

31:02.486 --> 31:05.613
All Herrmann wants
is a cool idea

31:05.822 --> 31:07.782
about how to sell
more beer and burgers.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.200
Do you have
a plan for that?

31:14.998 --> 31:16.123
No.

31:22.631 --> 31:23.798
Hey.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.301
You wanna get some
dinner tomorrow,
after shift?

31:28.470 --> 31:29.554
Let's do it another night.

31:30.681 --> 31:31.806
I'm meeting up
with Lindsay again.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.728
Ambulance 61,

31:37.813 --> 31:41.065
Squad 3, Truck 81.
Victim injured in
utility vault.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.079
Fire department!

31:56.582 --> 31:59.458
Where's the victim?
Who called it in?

32:01.837 --> 32:03.796
Let's spread out,
take a look around.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.260
Hey, over here!

32:13.348 --> 32:15.308
Guys, can you hear me?

32:15.392 --> 32:16.601
The victim on top
is breathing.

32:16.685 --> 32:17.977
I can't get a read
on the one under him.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.187
There's not enough room
to get down there and
carry them up.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.356
Mills, we can lower
you in upside-down.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.942
Get the victims handcuffed
to some webbing,
we'll pull them up.

32:25.027 --> 32:26.360
Got it.

32:35.537 --> 32:37.371
Casey, right there.
Check it out.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.457
Top victim's holding
a cell phone.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.083
He must be the one
who called for help.

32:41.168 --> 32:42.251
But if he was okay
when he called,

32:42.336 --> 32:43.586
how is he now
unconscious?

32:43.670 --> 32:46.547
Hey, they
could've hit a gas pocket.
They could be asphyxiated.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.090
Let's mask up.
Yeah.

32:48.175 --> 32:52.011
I'm gonna need a Hazmat
and two back-up ambulances
at 8922, 65th Street.

32:57.434 --> 32:58.893
He's up.

33:03.565 --> 33:04.607
Stop!

33:05.942 --> 33:07.360
- You ready?
- Yeah.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.454
Winch line, coming down.

33:23.794 --> 33:24.794
We're good to go!

33:35.514 --> 33:36.514
Okay.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.730
Get him on oxygen and
the monitor, make sure
his O2 sats are good.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.107
Got it.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.150
Hang on, Mills. Okay?

33:51.446 --> 33:52.697
Take it up!

33:52.781 --> 33:54.281
Okay, second
victim ready to go!

34:07.879 --> 34:10.131
No pulse.
He's not breathing.

34:11.133 --> 34:13.008
All right, Mills,
we're bringing you up!

34:16.805 --> 34:17.805
Mills!

34:17.889 --> 34:18.931
Pull him up fast!

34:20.517 --> 34:21.976
Get him up, damn it.
Go!

34:24.730 --> 34:25.730
Mills!

34:27.107 --> 34:28.107
The line's stuck!

34:29.067 --> 34:30.067
Mills!

34:30.152 --> 34:31.944
Come on, pull harder!
Mills!

34:36.658 --> 34:38.784
If his mask got
knocked loose, and
the gas gets to him...

34:39.327 --> 34:41.370
Here.
I'll try and un-snag him.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.794
Hold him,
hold him, hold him!

34:51.465 --> 34:52.465
Come on, Case.

34:54.551 --> 34:55.551
He's loose!

34:55.635 --> 34:56.635
Pull him up!

34:58.346 --> 34:59.346
Hang on, Mills!

35:02.392 --> 35:03.476
Mind his head.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.770
Got him.
Got him, hold on.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.354
All right,
I got his feet.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.614
Mask was secure.
Breathing normally.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.203
What the hell happened
down there, Mills?

35:22.287 --> 35:27.416
I don't know. It started
getting hard to breathe.
I... I must've blacked out.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.795
Maybe his SCBA
malfunctioned because
he was upside down?

35:30.879 --> 35:34.048
Whatever it was,
his vitals are stable.
He's okay.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.008
Glad you're all right, Mills.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.259
Yeah.

35:37.719 --> 35:40.554
Capp, check out that
equipment when we get
back to the house.

35:47.312 --> 35:48.854
Okay, so how do I
get that color here?

35:48.939 --> 35:52.066
You need to click on
that guy there, and that's
where the paintbrush is.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.109
It's time to go.
Oh, oh, cool.

35:54.236 --> 35:55.611
Oh, no, no, please,
brother, please.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.404
You're killing me.
Just, just let her
stay a little longer.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.782
I'm sorry, Cruz.
Yeah, we gotta
hit the road.

36:01.243 --> 36:03.327
All right, fine.
Pack up your stuff, baby.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.372
Okay. Oh, and don't hit
"exit" without saving.

36:06.581 --> 36:07.623
Chief.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.126
I wanted to thank you for
letting Naomi stick around.

36:12.546 --> 36:14.004
She seems like
a very nice girl.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.214
Bye.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.091
Yeah.

36:19.052 --> 36:20.594
Well, there's
nothing better.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.429
You'll see.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.766
Come on, baby.
Let's go.

36:26.268 --> 36:27.268
All right, you
had a good day?

36:27.352 --> 36:28.435
Yeah.
Yeah?

36:28.770 --> 36:29.854
You like the station?

36:31.439 --> 36:32.439
Hey!

36:33.775 --> 36:36.277
Thank you for
emailing those
apartment listings.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.404
Oh. Yeah, I thought
I'd give it a shot.

36:38.572 --> 36:40.322
I'm good where I am.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.784
Hector's actually a better
neighbor than most I had
back home.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.744
I'm just looking
out for you.
Thank you.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.833
You're my first
friend in Chicago,
you know that?

36:57.465 --> 37:00.426
Hey. You, uh, do a
check on the SCBA?

37:00.510 --> 37:02.720
Yeah, I couldn't find
anything wrong with it.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.238
Wanted to let you
know I talked
to the old man.

37:21.823 --> 37:22.823
He's willing to see you.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.868
He's willing to see me?
Mmm-hmm.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.579
All right.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.706
You go tell
Leonard Mills,

37:31.458 --> 37:33.834
in fact you tell
anybody in Joliet with
the last name Mills,

37:33.919 --> 37:35.711
they can go to hell.

37:55.357 --> 37:56.440
Okay.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.485
Wow me.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.908
I would like to take you
through a quick proposal
I put together.

38:08.370 --> 38:12.790
The most successful
new segment of the food
services industry today?

38:14.542 --> 38:15.542
Food trucks.

38:18.380 --> 38:19.463
Right.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.633
Food trucks are much cheaper
than restaurants to start up,

38:22.717 --> 38:25.052
so upfront costs
are much lower.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.471
Oh, and I did a
little research.
Um...

38:28.682 --> 38:30.349
Total revenue
for food trucks

38:30.433 --> 38:33.519
was $804 million
in 2013.

38:33.603 --> 38:38.440
And it's projected to
grow to 2.7 billion by 2017.

38:39.943 --> 38:44.321
Low initial risk, always
a solid investment strategy.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.575
Our plan,

38:48.660 --> 38:53.038
is to turn Molly's Two into a
mobile, go-anywhere business
that can supply everyone,

38:53.123 --> 38:56.250
from tailgaters at
Soldier Field
to students at UIC.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.087
So, while we're
making tons of cash,

39:00.714 --> 39:03.424
we are letting everybody
know the name of the best
damn bar in the city.

39:17.439 --> 39:18.772
Oh, my God.

39:19.274 --> 39:20.566
He's giving you the move.

39:21.026 --> 39:25.154
The rarely seen
double overhead shaka!

39:26.114 --> 39:28.449
Yeah? You like it?

39:28.783 --> 39:30.159
I love it!

39:30.243 --> 39:31.910
Cruz, you did it!

39:32.954 --> 39:34.038
Oh, man!

39:34.122 --> 39:39.376
Look at that! Oh, boy!
Jeez Louise! Holy smokes!

39:40.545 --> 39:43.297
Uh, um...
Excuse me,

39:43.381 --> 39:45.549
I'd just like to
understand why our baby

39:45.633 --> 39:49.178
has been put on the
high-risk category,
and what we can do about it.

39:49.804 --> 39:53.599
Your wife's age and
medical history are
the primary reasons.

39:53.683 --> 39:55.642
And there are some
markers that we need
to keep an eye on...

39:55.727 --> 39:57.478
But what does that mean?

39:58.188 --> 39:59.855
Eh?
How we gonna move forward?

40:00.482 --> 40:01.607
Honey,

40:02.567 --> 40:03.776
let the
doctor finish.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.403
The most important
thing to understand

40:06.488 --> 40:08.781
is that this
doesn't mean that
anything is wrong.

40:09.949 --> 40:13.494
Today's ultrasound will
give us a clearer sense of
how things are developing.

40:19.834 --> 40:20.959
Here we go.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.173
Here.

40:28.051 --> 40:29.384
Well, so far, so good.

40:29.469 --> 40:32.054
All these measurements
are right where we
like them to be.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.016
Look at that.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.477
Already an
active little one,
hmm?

40:49.197 --> 40:50.280
Erin!

40:50.698 --> 40:51.824
Hey!

40:52.742 --> 40:54.034
Listen, I...

40:55.036 --> 40:56.453
I messed this one up.

40:56.538 --> 40:58.080
My bad,
I was on my way,

40:58.164 --> 41:00.249
I stopped at the bar
to watch the Cubs.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.001
Ah, I just lost track of time.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.672
It's okay.
Yeah?

41:08.216 --> 41:10.676
Look, Kelly,
you and me,

41:12.178 --> 41:14.054
we're cut from the
same cloth, all right?

41:15.098 --> 41:17.057
I've been where you are,

41:17.392 --> 41:19.143
and I know
how hard it is,

41:20.228 --> 41:23.814
and I know you gotta do
whatever you gotta do,
to deal with it.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.608
So, I will be here
for you, as a friend.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.362
But I will not be the
girl sitting alone in
a restaurant,
