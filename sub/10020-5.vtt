00:04.288 --> 00:06.946
ER

00:07.047 --> 00:08.571
Previously on ER...

00:08.572 --> 00:10.517
This is Carla. Carla, this is Dr. Corday.

00:10.518 --> 00:14.285
- Doug has difficulty with strong women.
- I don't know about that.

00:14.286 --> 00:16.742
- We work as a team here.
- Come on! What team?

00:16.743 --> 00:19.837
Every contractor in Chicago
will hear that I have AIDS.

00:20.038 --> 00:23.922
Do you mind walking me up to
the platform? I get scared at night.

00:23.957 --> 00:28.230
- What's the story?
- Motorcycle accident. I'll handle it!

00:28.431 --> 00:31.579
But if my mother gets another bill
from this hospital...

00:32.014 --> 00:34.286
...maybe I'm gonna kick some ass.

00:34.717 --> 00:36.915
Maybe I'll start with yours.

00:37.992 --> 00:40.791
"Good Touch, Bad Touch"

00:42.017 --> 00:43.679
There could be some counseling...

00:43.896 --> 00:46.853
...for teenage mothers,
abuse victims, you know?

00:48.072 --> 00:49.733
- Doug?
- Listening.

00:49.951 --> 00:53.787
A clinic can keep track of people
who fall through the cracks.

00:54.001 --> 00:56.126
Here we go. I got it.

00:56.506 --> 00:58.335
No, it's a good idea.

00:58.552 --> 01:02.257
I just don't know that Kerry Weaver's
looking for new ways to spend money.

01:02.477 --> 01:04.471
It would be on a volunteer basis.

01:05.358 --> 01:06.640
It's worth a try.

01:06.862 --> 01:07.942
All right, you ready?

01:08.114 --> 01:09.610
Yeah. I'm ready if you are.

01:10.118 --> 01:12.695
I am. This is your idea.
Hang on.

01:12.916 --> 01:16.123
I was kidding. I didn't think
you'd actually rent equipment.

01:16.298 --> 01:19.303
You talked about this fantasy
years ago.

01:19.472 --> 01:21.265
I did not.

01:22.144 --> 01:23.474
Did I?

01:24.733 --> 01:28.153
Actually, I think you accused me
of taping myself...

01:28.366 --> 01:30.242
...with various 20-year-olds.

01:30.453 --> 01:32.247
- That was harsh.
- Yeah.

01:32.458 --> 01:33.835
Was I right?

01:35.047 --> 01:37.172
No. You see all this stuff?

01:38.011 --> 01:40.552
I did it because I want to
make you happy.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.049
Really?

01:43.314 --> 01:44.347
You did all this for me?

01:44.525 --> 01:46.354
I'd do anything for you.

01:54.212 --> 01:56.671
Come on, Reece. Daddy's working.

01:57.636 --> 01:59.548
I've gotta study for
a proctocolectomy.

01:59.724 --> 02:01.350
Come on. Give me a break.

02:01.561 --> 02:03.687
Please, Reece? Please?

02:05.403 --> 02:07.481
Okay, okay, okay.

02:07.741 --> 02:09.866
Come on.
All right. All right.

02:10.205 --> 02:11.784
I know. I know. I know.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.459
Oh, boy! Oh, boy.

02:14.673 --> 02:15.919
You're gonna wake up Mommy.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.256
You're gonna wake up Mommy.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.512
Do you want to wake up Mommy, huh?

02:19.725 --> 02:21.055
Do you want to wake up Mommy?

02:21.270 --> 02:23.942
If you wake up Mommy,
she's not gonna be happy.

02:28.285 --> 02:29.995
She's not gonna be happy.

02:33.337 --> 02:34.798
Okay, okay, okay.

02:34.966 --> 02:37.887
Come here. Come here.
It's just me and you, okay?

02:38.097 --> 02:40.223
It's just me and you.
Come on.

02:43.192 --> 02:44.818
Want to get funky with your old man?

02:45.029 --> 02:46.525
Want to get funky with your old man?

02:46.741 --> 02:49.449
Sing, Papa don't take no mess
Hey, hey, hey

02:49.664 --> 02:51.575
Papa don't, Papa don't, Papa don't

02:51.793 --> 02:55.712
Come on, Reece! Come on,
give me a break, please?

02:55.927 --> 02:58.682
What do I have to do to
make you stop crying?

02:59.017 --> 03:00.846
Okay, okay.

03:02.232 --> 03:04.025
I know. I know. I know.

03:04.195 --> 03:05.359
Come here.

03:05.573 --> 03:07.698
What do I have to do to get you
to stop crying?

03:07.911 --> 03:09.371
Talk to me. Talk to me.

03:09.581 --> 03:11.825
Okay. All right, man.
Come here.

03:12.045 --> 03:15.548
You want to study with your old man?
Want to study with your old man?

03:15.719 --> 03:17.001
How's that?

03:17.222 --> 03:18.338
Come here.

03:18.559 --> 03:21.052
Come on and study.
Come on. Come on.

03:21.815 --> 03:24.226
I know. I know. Listen.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.325
"After performing the colectomy,
take the distal ileum...

03:27.536 --> 03:31.075
...and measure seven inches from the
transected distal end, proximally. "

03:31.670 --> 03:33.166
Seven inches. Seven inches.

03:33.382 --> 03:36.422
"Fold that distal end upward
to form a J-pouch. "

03:36.597 --> 03:39.091
You like that?
You like that, Reece?

03:39.311 --> 03:40.771
You like forming a J-pouch?

03:40.939 --> 03:43.647
Do you know how to form a J-pouch?
Okay, here we go.

03:43.862 --> 03:48.779
"And begin stapling the two limbs of
the small bowel with the G.I.A. 55. "

03:49.124 --> 03:50.619
Hey, man.
You like that, huh?

04:01.191 --> 04:04.979
Hi, we're not here.
Please leave a message at the tone.

04:05.199 --> 04:08.406
Lisa, whose voice is that
on the machine?

04:09.166 --> 04:11.660
Lisa, pick up the phone.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.172
Lisa, who you there with?

04:14.678 --> 04:17.766
Pick up! I know you home.
Sorry-ass bitch.

04:17.976 --> 04:19.176
Why you got to-?

04:19.856 --> 04:23.193
Pick up the damn phone now, Lisa.
You know I-

04:23.697 --> 04:25.027
Hey, wrong number.

04:25.242 --> 04:27.652
Who the hell are you?
Put Lisa on the phone!

04:27.873 --> 04:29.915
Look, pay attention, dumb-ass.

04:30.127 --> 04:34.510
There's nobody here named Lisa.
You got the wrong number. Goodbye.

05:40.319 --> 05:41.351
- Hey, Mark.
- Peter.

05:41.571 --> 05:43.115
Thought you didn't drink caffeine.

05:43.325 --> 05:46.947
I do now. You had your kid
when you were in med school, right?

05:47.166 --> 05:49.839
Sure did.
What a mistake that was.

05:50.048 --> 05:51.592
See you around, Peter.

06:00.570 --> 06:03.111
We got Ernesto Ruiz in Curtain 2.
18 years old.

06:03.326 --> 06:05.654
Through-and-through GSW to
the right shoulder.

06:05.873 --> 06:09.127
The same knucklehead was in here
before, shot in the chest.

06:09.339 --> 06:11.250
He must wear a bull's-eye.

06:11.468 --> 06:14.176
I gave him a gram of Ancef
and called Surgery.

06:14.391 --> 06:17.431
Three is a 40-year-old gentleman
with urinary retention.

06:17.606 --> 06:22.107
And Jeanie's working up a 65-year-old
woman in Exam 2 with abdominal pain.

06:22.283 --> 06:23.945
We'll do rounds at about 8.

06:24.162 --> 06:25.907
And I'll drum up more business.

06:26.124 --> 06:28.203
Mark, take a look at a patient for me?

06:28.421 --> 06:31.960
Female, 65, recurring
right upper-quadrant pain...

06:32.179 --> 06:36.051
...becoming increasingly worse.
Temp's 101, white count's 15,000.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.815
She's vomiting bilious material.

06:38.025 --> 06:39.271
Sounds like cholecystitis.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.528
- I think she needs surgery.
- Let's look.

06:41.741 --> 06:43.118
Haleh, ¿está por aquí?

06:43.328 --> 06:45.656
Hi, Pablo.
No, Haleh is not here.

06:46.084 --> 06:49.088
- Is Haleh here?
- No. She called in sick today.

06:49.257 --> 06:50.289
But today's Thursday.

06:50.510 --> 06:53.182
I know. But she'll be back
tomorrow, okay?

06:53.474 --> 06:54.507
She'll be back later?

06:54.685 --> 06:57.689
She'll be back tomorrow.
She'll be glad to see you then.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.147
Yeah, okay.

06:59.696 --> 07:01.358
Hey, Anna. You got any procedures?

07:01.533 --> 07:03.243
Can't wait for the next one, huh?

07:03.454 --> 07:04.700
No. It's for Fu's benefit.

07:04.915 --> 07:07.540
I swear I'll turn him
into a functioning med student.

07:07.755 --> 07:09.417
How many times has he puked in Trauma?

07:09.634 --> 07:12.638
Twice. But the second time
was really dry heaves.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.048
How's yours doing?

07:14.269 --> 07:17.558
He's not the sharpest knife in
the drawer, but he hasn't puked yet.

07:17.776 --> 07:19.236
You got anything we can do?

07:19.446 --> 07:22.784
- You can cath the guy in Curtain 3.
- Perfect. Thank you.

07:23.455 --> 07:25.830
- Tell me if this hurts.
- You're good-looking.

07:26.044 --> 07:27.325
Well, thank you.

07:27.547 --> 07:28.627
Does this hurt?

07:30.010 --> 07:32.089
Last night it was so bad
I couldn't sleep.

07:32.265 --> 07:34.260
- How about here?
- Not really.

07:34.436 --> 07:37.013
- Here?
- No, higher.

07:41.243 --> 07:44.449
Can I have my hand back?
Ma'am, come on.

07:44.625 --> 07:45.741
Give me my hand back.

07:47.255 --> 07:49.714
Wait, handsome.

07:49.928 --> 07:50.960
You can handle this.

07:51.139 --> 07:53.632
She's got a hot gallbladder.
We should get a consult.

07:53.811 --> 07:54.843
- Do it.
- But-

07:55.064 --> 07:56.975
I don't have time for this today.

07:57.235 --> 08:00.109
The average male penis uses
a 16 French Foley catheter.

08:00.325 --> 08:01.869
Those French think of everything.

08:02.079 --> 08:03.491
It refers to the circumference.

08:03.665 --> 08:06.159
One French is a third of
a millimeter diameter.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.840
Check the Foley balloon
for leaks...

08:09.052 --> 08:11.510
...by injecting some saline.

08:11.682 --> 08:14.640
And you lube up the tip
with lidocaine jelly.

08:14.856 --> 08:16.518
Now you are ready to insert...

08:16.735 --> 08:19.490
...applying gentle, constant pressure.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.528
Isn't this a nurse's job?

08:21.704 --> 08:22.868
You need to know how.

08:23.457 --> 08:26.711
So grab that penis
and show it who's boss.

08:28.719 --> 08:31.047
Yo! When can I go home?

08:31.224 --> 08:33.265
- Who's your doctor?
- I don't know her name.

08:33.479 --> 08:35.438
Go back to your bed
and wait for her.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.229
What're you doing to that dude?

08:37.446 --> 08:39.606
Come on. Let's go.
Back to your bed.

08:39.826 --> 08:42.533
Sometimes it's tricky
to get it past the prostate.

08:42.748 --> 08:46.418
You all did this to me last time.
I wish I knew who it was too.

08:46.632 --> 08:49.755
Do I have to call Security?
Back to your own room!

08:49.930 --> 08:51.426
It's in, Dr. Carter.

08:51.642 --> 08:53.138
Balloon's inflated.

08:53.354 --> 08:55.433
Hook it up to the bag, Ivan!

09:00.787 --> 09:03.281
Hi. Who peed in your corn flakes?

09:03.459 --> 09:04.540
What?

09:05.046 --> 09:06.458
You're in a bad mood.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.628
I'm just caught up in this lawsuit.

09:08.804 --> 09:10.597
I have to give a deposition today.

09:10.808 --> 09:11.972
Lawsuit? Over what?

09:12.186 --> 09:14.727
Family of a gunshot victim
who died last spring.

09:14.942 --> 09:17.566
It's a shakedown.
They're just looking for money.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.372
I'm pretty good at back rubs.
Might help you relax.

09:21.581 --> 09:23.576
Thanks, I'll take
a rain check on that.

09:23.794 --> 09:25.504
Okay, sure.

09:27.385 --> 09:29.713
I hope that wasn't inappropriate
to say at work?

09:29.932 --> 09:32.307
Don't worry. I won't sue.

09:34.484 --> 09:36.028
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey.

09:36.279 --> 09:37.609
So where's that going?

09:37.824 --> 09:39.201
- What?
- You and the desk clerk.

09:39.369 --> 09:41.530
There is no me and the desk clerk.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.078
A girl like that.
If you get into something...

09:44.296 --> 09:46.006
...think ahead how to get out.

09:46.217 --> 09:47.594
A girl like what?

09:47.804 --> 09:49.383
Pretty needy.

09:50.309 --> 09:52.351
You don't know anything about her.

09:52.564 --> 09:55.438
And B: If I was interested in her
or anybody else...

09:55.654 --> 09:57.613
...I don't need your advice.

10:07.429 --> 10:10.005
Brett Nicholson, 20.
Has shortness of breath.

10:10.226 --> 10:11.806
No fever, a little tachy at 100.

10:12.022 --> 10:13.601
- I'm Dr. Del Amico.
- Hi.

10:13.776 --> 10:15.188
Tell me what happened.

10:15.404 --> 10:18.741
I was running and got so
out of breath I had to sit down.

10:18.953 --> 10:20.913
Ever had shortness of breath before?

10:21.125 --> 10:24.164
No, just the last few weeks,
but it's getting worse.

10:24.381 --> 10:25.581
Any history of asthma?

10:25.759 --> 10:26.840
No.

10:27.054 --> 10:30.177
- Okay, let's listen to your chest.
- All right.

10:30.812 --> 10:32.807
- You're an athlete?
- I'm a runner at De Paul.

10:33.192 --> 10:35.650
- Take deep breaths, please.
- What's your event?

10:35.864 --> 10:37.943
-400 meters.
- Again.

10:38.161 --> 10:40.156
- Best time?
-46 flat.

10:40.374 --> 10:41.656
Man, that's good.

10:41.835 --> 10:43.877
Deep breaths.
You listening, James?

10:44.341 --> 10:48.343
I'm freaking out. Not being able to
run is like not being able to walk.

10:48.558 --> 10:49.674
Hold on.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.012
What do you hear?

10:52.358 --> 10:53.735
Scattered rales, bilaterally.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.355
I agree. What do you want to do?

10:56.533 --> 10:59.206
Get a chest film and a CBC to
check the white count.

10:59.414 --> 11:02.205
- That won't change the management.
- What do you think it is?

11:02.379 --> 11:04.374
We'll have to wait for the x-ray.

11:04.550 --> 11:08.553
Call Radiology, and next time, make
sure the nurse gets them into a gown.

11:08.726 --> 11:10.471
Kerry, do you have a minute?

11:10.688 --> 11:12.933
- Half a minute.
- Can I bounce an idea off you?

11:13.110 --> 11:14.143
Sure.

11:14.363 --> 11:17.367
I see a need for some patient
follow-up in the ER.

11:17.578 --> 11:19.240
Services, like psych counseling.

11:19.457 --> 11:23.293
We patch people up and throw them out
without any help of staying well.

11:23.507 --> 11:27.130
I thought of a women's and children's
clinic, all volunteer-staffed.

11:27.349 --> 11:29.094
A women's and children's clinic?

11:29.311 --> 11:32.601
We could designate an exam room,
two or three days a week.

11:32.777 --> 11:34.273
It's an interesting idea.

11:34.489 --> 11:36.614
I'd volunteer.
Lots of docs and nurses would.

11:36.786 --> 11:41.084
I'll add it to the list of ideas
we'd implement if we had the money.

11:41.295 --> 11:44.383
Stoney Island's ER got $100,000 from
the Department of Public Health...

11:44.594 --> 11:46.922
...for a wound-check clinic.
If they can do it-

11:47.141 --> 11:50.395
I'm going to a budget meeting to see
that we don't compromise...

11:50.607 --> 11:51.806
...basic patient care.

11:52.026 --> 11:54.734
I'm not looking to take on
any new side projects.

11:54.949 --> 11:57.490
But my door is always open.

12:00.002 --> 12:02.840
- Going someplace, Ernesto?
- I'm leaving. Where's my shirt?

12:03.008 --> 12:04.290
Surgery's seen you?

12:04.511 --> 12:05.544
Bullet went through.

12:05.764 --> 12:07.557
A surgeon has to explore the wound.

12:07.768 --> 12:08.968
Nothing's wrong with me.

12:09.188 --> 12:11.230
- You need a wound explored?
- Hold on.

12:11.443 --> 12:14.363
Now you're a tough guy?
Last time you yelled for Mama.

12:14.533 --> 12:15.909
- I'll help.
- You're not a surgeon.

12:16.829 --> 12:17.862
I've done it 50 times.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.072
What are you doing?

12:21.589 --> 12:22.753
Bye-bye, chica.

12:25.723 --> 12:27.349
You think I can't débride a wound?

12:27.560 --> 12:30.850
Put some pressure on that so you
don't bleed all over!

12:31.068 --> 12:33.110
- See you next time.
- I could've helped.

12:33.323 --> 12:36.077
I called Surgery.
Who's supposed to cover the ER?

12:36.245 --> 12:38.918
You're not gonna be sick, are you?

12:41.841 --> 12:45.296
We'll start with the colectomy
at the cecum and proceed distally.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.679
This bowel's very friable.

12:46.851 --> 12:47.967
Metz.

12:48.897 --> 12:52.520
How do you make a W-pouch,
Dr. Benton?

12:52.739 --> 12:57.205
Measure seven inches from the
transected distal and fold it upward-

12:57.416 --> 12:59.291
That's a J-pouch.

12:59.503 --> 13:01.379
I said W-pouch.

13:03.554 --> 13:05.180
I assumed we were doing a-

13:05.391 --> 13:06.803
Dr. Corday, W-pouch?

13:07.019 --> 13:09.727
It's like the J-pouch,
but with two extra loops.

13:09.942 --> 13:12.780
You fold the distal ileum
back three times instead of one.

13:12.990 --> 13:14.071
Quite right.

13:14.243 --> 13:16.915
Didn't get that far in your reading,
Dr. Benton?

13:17.124 --> 13:21.078
I understand you're behind with
your reports and discharge summaries.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.093
I'll get caught up this week.

13:23.805 --> 13:25.883
Perhaps you should be
in Medical Records.

13:26.102 --> 13:27.930
Dr. Anspaugh, I'm prepared for this.

13:28.148 --> 13:29.263
Step out, Dr. Benton.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.649
Catch up on your dictations.
Don't worry about the patient.

13:32.866 --> 13:36.619
I'd say that he is in quite
capable hands.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.459
What are those things?

13:59.673 --> 14:03.295
Cannonball infiltrates.
Probably testicular cancer.

14:03.473 --> 14:06.145
- Testicular?
- It metastasizes to the lungs.

14:06.354 --> 14:07.470
Who's the unlucky soul?

14:07.690 --> 14:11.229
20-year-old male,
presented with shortness of breath.

14:11.448 --> 14:13.858
Sweet guy. Athlete.
He won't know what hit him.

14:14.079 --> 14:16.407
- Did you do the testicular exam?
- That's next.

14:16.626 --> 14:18.870
- If it's better, I'll do it.
- Why's that better?

14:19.590 --> 14:22.001
In case he's more comfortable
with a male doctor.

14:22.179 --> 14:24.970
If a woman needed a pelvic exam,
would you give it to me?

14:25.186 --> 14:27.015
- I was just offering.
- I can handle it.

14:27.190 --> 14:28.650
Okay. Fine.

14:30.948 --> 14:32.112
Great.

14:34.664 --> 14:38.037
Cynthia, how long has Pablo been
sitting out there?

14:38.213 --> 14:40.208
That guy? Ten minutes.

14:40.719 --> 14:44.222
Will you tell him Haleh's not
coming in, try back tomorrow?

14:44.435 --> 14:46.014
- Okay.
- Thanks.

14:46.356 --> 14:48.647
- Somebody called for a surgeon?
- Three hours ago.

14:48.819 --> 14:49.852
I called, Dale.

14:50.072 --> 14:51.532
Something about a gangrenous toe?

14:51.742 --> 14:53.951
Joseph Kupchak, 49-year-old
diabetic male...

14:54.164 --> 14:58.036
...noticed an infection on his
left baby toe, but put off coming in.

14:58.256 --> 14:59.918
This is why you quit surgery.

15:00.093 --> 15:02.468
- How's the internship going?
- Going great.

15:03.016 --> 15:04.928
Mr. Kupchak, I'm Dr. Edson.

15:05.146 --> 15:08.185
I'm a surgeon.
I'm here to take care of this toe.

15:09.739 --> 15:13.242
Oh, Carter. This looks like
something you could've handled.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.494
Tell me if you feel this.

15:18.048 --> 15:21.005
I don't believe that they don't
trust you to clip a toe.

15:21.222 --> 15:23.632
I clipped a couple of toes
when I was a student.

15:23.852 --> 15:25.182
- Feel that?
- No.

15:25.397 --> 15:28.354
- How's Benton treating you?
- Piece of cake. I got him handled.

15:28.529 --> 15:29.609
Rocket's back.

15:29.823 --> 15:31.284
Dr. Romano? I heard that.

15:31.493 --> 15:34.034
He's letting me scrub in.
Lap choly with a laser.

15:34.249 --> 15:35.959
Ever work with him before
you washed out?

15:36.170 --> 15:37.582
I didn't wash out, Dale.

15:37.799 --> 15:39.128
You're sticking to your story.

15:39.343 --> 15:40.970
- What do you got?
- Head lac, MVA.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.644
- Excuse me.
- Head lac? Gosh, golly.

15:48.196 --> 15:49.228
Feel that?

15:49.448 --> 15:51.408
September 5, '52.

15:51.745 --> 15:53.621
- Hi. I'm Dr. Carter.
- Tom Angevine.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.709
What happened, Mr. Angevine?

15:55.879 --> 15:57.209
Going to a lunch appointment...

15:57.382 --> 16:00.386
...then I get this
sudden, blinding headache.

16:00.555 --> 16:01.671
Straight into a tree.

16:01.891 --> 16:04.931
- Pressure's 210/160.
- Do you have history of hypertension?

16:05.148 --> 16:07.440
Yeah. I'm taking Vasotec and Lasix.

16:08.906 --> 16:10.236
Let's bring that pressure down.

16:10.410 --> 16:14.079
Let's start nitroprussides,
0.3 mics per kilo, per minute.

16:15.044 --> 16:17.669
Get an EKG and keep monitoring
his pressure.

16:18.719 --> 16:21.260
- Call for an abdominal CT.
- Abdominal CT?

16:21.433 --> 16:23.262
- Right.
- For a hypertensive emergency?

16:23.479 --> 16:24.809
Do it please, Conni. Okay?

16:25.024 --> 16:26.603
Okay.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.109
- Hey.
- Hey, Brett.

16:29.283 --> 16:30.695
You find out what's wrong?

16:30.912 --> 16:33.951
We have an idea, but we need to
do a further examination.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.371
I need to examine your testicles.

16:38.595 --> 16:40.839
I'm short of breath.
Why my testicles?

16:41.058 --> 16:42.685
I have to check for abnormalities.

16:42.895 --> 16:45.306
My student can leave the room
if you like?

16:46.779 --> 16:49.355
- No, he can stay, I don't care.
- All right.

16:54.545 --> 16:57.466
Could you take down your pants
and underwear, please?

16:57.677 --> 16:59.672
Alrighty.

17:01.059 --> 17:03.387
It's a good thing I put on
clean drawers.

17:12.290 --> 17:13.324
Thanks.

17:22.104 --> 17:24.395
Oh, man. Oh, man!

17:24.567 --> 17:26.978
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

17:27.198 --> 17:29.074
It's a normal male reaction.

17:29.244 --> 17:32.082
Oh, God! I'm sorry, doctor.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

17:32.292 --> 17:34.584
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

17:37.094 --> 17:38.839
Okay, just wait. Just wait.

17:39.766 --> 17:40.966
It's really not a problem.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.848
Okay, okay.

17:44.318 --> 17:45.944
It's important we finish-

17:46.113 --> 17:47.942
Just give me a minute, okay?

17:49.955 --> 17:50.987
All right?

17:52.544 --> 17:53.790
Jeez!

17:55.258 --> 17:58.963
Tell me about your
hypertensive crisis, Mr. Angevine?

17:59.183 --> 18:01.891
A minor trauma case,
head lac from an MVA.

18:02.106 --> 18:06.523
Upon exam he was tachycardic,
diaphoretic, BP was 210/160.

18:06.741 --> 18:09.199
- We got his pressure down.
- Why'd you do an abdominal CT?

18:09.413 --> 18:13.118
History of flushing and palpitations.
Classic findings for a pheo.

18:13.338 --> 18:15.796
You're fishing with
pretty expensive bait.

18:16.010 --> 18:18.089
- What'd the CT show?
- It hasn't come back.

18:18.307 --> 18:21.395
It's tempting to reach for
a surgical cause, but in the ER...

18:21.605 --> 18:23.731
...we can't run expensive
tests based on hunches.

18:23.944 --> 18:25.986
Just check with me in the future.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.490
- Carol.
- Yeah?

18:28.704 --> 18:32.872
I didn't mean to be short earlier.
I think an ER clinic is interesting.

18:33.088 --> 18:35.380
You might be able to get
some funds for it.

18:35.552 --> 18:38.128
- I might?
- Yeah. Here's the place to start.

18:38.349 --> 18:40.391
- What are these?
- Grant application manuals.

18:40.604 --> 18:43.229
This is a good book
on fundraising strategies.

18:43.402 --> 18:45.943
Oh, no, Kerry. I didn't mean me.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.702
I don't have the time.

18:48.329 --> 18:49.575
What do I do with these?

18:49.790 --> 18:52.082
The only way a good idea
comes to life is...

18:52.254 --> 18:54.213
...if somebody chooses to
see it through.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.753
If you need help with these,
we can talk later.

18:56.972 --> 18:59.383
Kerry, I've got a problem
with this case.

18:59.603 --> 19:01.063
Could you tell Mark?

19:01.273 --> 19:02.935
Mark is the problem.

19:03.152 --> 19:07.736
I worked up this LOL, and Mark left
during the exam and refused to finish.

19:07.954 --> 19:09.865
- Why?
- The woman's a little flaky.

19:10.084 --> 19:12.660
She put Mark's hand on her breast.
But she's sick.

19:12.881 --> 19:15.292
- Ultrasound confirms cholangitis.
- Let me see.

19:15.470 --> 19:17.631
Maybe he's got a lot on his mind.

19:17.808 --> 19:18.972
She's a Medicare patient?

19:19.145 --> 19:22.600
I was reluctant to bring this to you.
If somebody's in a bad mood-

19:22.777 --> 19:23.810
I'll talk to Mark.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.442
I'll talk to him.

19:28.748 --> 19:31.955
Brett, you have a mass
on your left testicle.

19:32.172 --> 19:36.389
Chest x-ray shows spots on your lungs,
which is why you're short of breath.

19:36.849 --> 19:38.013
Spots? What?

19:38.227 --> 19:41.184
The growth on your testicle
may have spread to your lungs.

19:42.904 --> 19:44.364
What? Cancer?

19:44.574 --> 19:47.032
Before we determine that,
I must draw some blood...

19:47.204 --> 19:49.615
...and you need a CAT scan
on your abdomen.

19:50.211 --> 19:53.001
Could I have a pen and paper?
I want to write this down.

19:53.217 --> 19:54.381
Sure.

19:56.516 --> 19:58.511
Thank you. Thanks.

20:00.232 --> 20:01.562
Okay, so...

20:02.069 --> 20:04.111
What happens now,
once you draw some blood?

20:04.324 --> 20:08.540
Right. Then I'll send you back
to Radiology for the CAT scan.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.423
And then I'll call an oncologist
down to see you.

20:11.631 --> 20:15.051
Okay. So how bad is the cancer?

20:15.264 --> 20:16.724
We're not certain it's cancer.

20:16.934 --> 20:18.264
What happens if it is?

20:18.437 --> 20:21.110
You should discuss this
with an oncologist.

20:21.277 --> 20:24.447
I don't want to wait for
someone else if you can tell me now.

20:28.125 --> 20:29.241
Okay.

20:31.048 --> 20:34.467
If it is cancer, treatment is
removal of the testicle...

20:34.639 --> 20:37.215
...plus chemotherapy,
probably radiation as well.

20:37.436 --> 20:38.683
Cut one of my nuts off?

20:38.898 --> 20:42.187
With successful treatment,
there's a 70% survival rate.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.905
Oh, my God.

20:48.251 --> 20:49.795
Oh, my God.

20:56.853 --> 20:58.099
Dr. Greene?

20:58.314 --> 20:59.430
Mark?

21:00.945 --> 21:01.977
Hi, Alan.

21:02.197 --> 21:03.313
You didn't get my page?

21:03.533 --> 21:05.612
Yeah. No, I got it.
I just...

21:05.830 --> 21:07.659
I was just on my way up.

21:08.127 --> 21:10.703
If you're gonna lie to an attorney,
try harder.

21:10.924 --> 21:14.213
I know you don't feel the need
for final preparation, but I do.

21:14.432 --> 21:15.512
We're not prepared?

21:15.726 --> 21:17.388
For a deposition,
there's no such thing.

21:17.605 --> 21:19.896
Any question they ask,
you answer what?

21:20.069 --> 21:22.776
"Yes," "no" or "I don't recall. "

21:22.992 --> 21:24.404
That's right, and nothing else.

21:24.578 --> 21:26.573
Why haven't we settled this already?

21:26.750 --> 21:28.744
They won't come down
from eight figures.

21:28.963 --> 21:32.216
They say they're entitled to what
Kenny Law might have earned...

21:32.428 --> 21:35.967
...if he'd made it to the NBA.
And a jury could go for that.

21:36.186 --> 21:38.146
Their lawyer,
she'll try to rattle you.

21:38.566 --> 21:41.939
Can't rattle me. I did all
I could to save the boy's life.

21:42.116 --> 21:45.120
I'll page you when they come.
Answer it this time.

21:49.256 --> 21:51.832
"Primary surgeon, Dr. Peter Benton.

21:52.053 --> 21:54.892
Attending, Angela Hicks. "

21:55.102 --> 21:57.143
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.941
Papa don't
Hey, hey, hey

22:02.283 --> 22:04.077
Hey! Papa don't

22:04.288 --> 22:06.996
All right, come on. Do this.

22:08.129 --> 22:09.590
" Clinical narrative.

22:09.799 --> 22:13.849
Patient presented to the emergency
department with a gunshot wound...

22:14.017 --> 22:15.976
...and a systolic blood pressure of-"

22:16.188 --> 22:19.109
Hey, how are you doing?
Dr. Peter Benton.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.352
Vinay Radhakrishnan.

22:20.531 --> 22:24.699
Yeah. That's the way to do it
instead of letting them stack up.

22:24.873 --> 22:27.367
It's like falling off a freight train.

22:29.007 --> 22:30.633
Do you have kids?

22:30.844 --> 22:33.552
Yes. Three boys, two girls.

22:34.561 --> 22:38.064
How do you balance it with work?
I mean, if you don't mind me asking?

22:38.360 --> 22:42.410
My wife handles everything with
the children. Pardon me, please.

22:43.914 --> 22:48.546
This is Dr. Vinay Radhakrishnan
dictating a summary on Stella Klein.

22:48.757 --> 22:52.095
Medical record number: 84-98-29.

22:52.474 --> 22:54.018
I didn't know what to say.

22:54.227 --> 22:57.232
He had an erection, and I
needed to finish the exam.

22:57.443 --> 23:00.281
Don't beat yourself up.
You like the spicy string beans?

23:00.491 --> 23:03.828
- Yeah. All of it's good. How much was it?
- No, my treat.

23:04.040 --> 23:06.118
- How much do I owe?
- Why can't I treat?

23:06.295 --> 23:08.967
Thirty dollars?
Where is this place?

23:09.719 --> 23:11.131
It's on Wacker.

23:11.723 --> 23:15.143
You keep spending like that,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

23:15.314 --> 23:18.235
I got in over my head.
Maxed-out my credit cards-

23:18.446 --> 23:20.820
Mr. Angevine's CT. You're right.
It's a pheo.

23:21.034 --> 23:22.780
- Yeah?
- Good pickup, Dr. Carter.

23:23.665 --> 23:24.412
There it is.

23:24.625 --> 23:27.879
DC the Nipride and start him
on phentolamine, 5mg IV.

23:28.091 --> 23:30.002
I'll call down a surgeon.

23:30.179 --> 23:32.507
Way to go, Dr. Carter!

23:32.684 --> 23:34.430
Here, I owe you a $1.50.

23:34.647 --> 23:37.437
I gotta go check on my track star.

23:46.881 --> 23:48.461
Ding Dongs?

23:49.553 --> 23:52.593
- Want a bite?
- No, I'll just watch you eat it.

23:53.061 --> 23:55.020
These are my all-time favorites.

23:55.190 --> 23:56.223
In Virginia...

23:56.401 --> 23:59.572
...they didn't call them Ding Dongs,
they called them King Don's...

23:59.784 --> 24:01.244
...on the package.

24:01.412 --> 24:05.711
Why not call them Ding Dongs in
Virginia? What law does that violate?

24:05.963 --> 24:07.625
Maybe you can help me with this:

24:07.842 --> 24:10.383
Ding Dongs, Ho Hos.
Same food, just different shape.

24:10.598 --> 24:12.392
- How'd they get away with that?
- Right!

24:12.603 --> 24:16.937
Why pretend that they're different?
Ding Dong-Ho Ho conspiracy.

24:17.154 --> 24:19.862
- Mark, can I see you for a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

24:20.077 --> 24:21.109
What's up?

24:21.329 --> 24:24.536
You saw a patient this morning.
Marian Rice?

24:24.753 --> 24:25.869
Horny old lady.

24:26.090 --> 24:31.006
Medicare won't reimburse 100% unless
an Attending examines the patient...

24:31.225 --> 24:33.019
...and writes out a note in detail.

24:33.230 --> 24:35.225
You walked out during the exam.

24:35.443 --> 24:37.153
Who told you that? Jeanie?

24:37.364 --> 24:40.451
We can't write "seen and agree"
notes on Medicare patients.

24:40.662 --> 24:42.289
You didn't read the memo?

24:42.499 --> 24:44.161
Which memo was that?

24:45.631 --> 24:47.710
What do I have to do
so we can get paid?

24:47.928 --> 24:51.347
Examine this patient and chart
your findings in detail.

24:51.519 --> 24:55.521
If I have to examine every Medicare
patient, why do we have P.A.s?

24:55.694 --> 24:57.024
It's not about the P.A.s.

24:57.197 --> 24:59.358
All right. No problem.

25:00.287 --> 25:01.569
Jeanie, football.

25:01.791 --> 25:04.201
- What?
- Bears play tonight.

25:04.505 --> 25:06.880
- Want some squares for Al?
- No, not this week.

25:07.052 --> 25:09.213
Y'all quit rooting for the Bears?

25:09.390 --> 25:12.228
- We're rooting, not betting.
- You know where to find me.

25:12.438 --> 25:15.562
- What's all this stuff?
- Grant applications from Weaver.

25:15.779 --> 25:18.486
- Might start a clinic in the ER.
- Like Stoney Island?

25:18.702 --> 25:21.659
That's where gangsters go to get
wounds looked at.

25:21.875 --> 25:23.751
They got $100,000 state grant.

25:23.921 --> 25:26.130
Weaver's got you panhandling for her?

25:26.301 --> 25:27.333
No, it was my idea.

25:27.554 --> 25:29.347
A nurse started that clinic.

25:29.558 --> 25:31.469
- Really?
- Yep. ER charge nurse.

25:31.688 --> 25:34.526
- Angevine's in shock! His BP crashed!
- My pheo?

25:34.736 --> 25:36.980
He's tossing multiple PVCs
and desaturating.

25:37.199 --> 25:40.572
Get four units of O-neg,
and find out why Surgery's not here.

25:40.790 --> 25:41.954
- What?
- He's in V-fib.

25:42.168 --> 25:43.878
- His tumor's infracting.
- Where's Surgery?

25:44.089 --> 25:46.298
- Charging 200.
- Clear.

25:47.095 --> 25:48.176
Go again.

25:48.348 --> 25:50.806
- Charging 300.
- Clear.

25:51.104 --> 25:53.146
Let's move him straight into Surgery.

25:53.359 --> 25:56.482
- Shocked him out of V-fib. You Romano?
- Call me Rocket.

25:56.699 --> 25:59.489
- Dr. Carter made the diagnosis.
- Great.

25:59.705 --> 26:01.499
Don't wait for me. Let's go.

26:01.793 --> 26:04.204
- Ever do this, Dr. Edson?
- You gonna use a scope?

26:04.424 --> 26:06.549
We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

26:06.762 --> 26:08.389
- Look out!
- Go ahead.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.851
- Nice work, Carter.
- Thank you.

26:13.109 --> 26:14.854
Let's go! Let's go!

26:27.682 --> 26:29.475
I brought you some tea.

26:32.317 --> 26:33.349
Thanks.

26:33.569 --> 26:36.408
This'll be me in a month,
then you can return the favor.

26:36.617 --> 26:40.121
Oh, man! How did
the proctocolectomy go?

26:40.334 --> 26:43.421
My ileal-anal pouch drew
rave reviews.

26:44.509 --> 26:46.754
You've not worked with
Dr. Romano, have you?

26:46.973 --> 26:48.137
Rocket Romano?

26:48.351 --> 26:50.595
No. Ten months a year he's in Europe.

26:50.772 --> 26:54.192
He's performing an operation
tomorrow with an extraordinary device:

26:54.405 --> 26:57.576
The Aesop 2000. Are you
interested in robotics?

26:59.124 --> 27:01.748
- No.
- I can get you on the team.

27:02.381 --> 27:04.042
It's a robotic arm with a camera.

27:04.260 --> 27:07.798
Rocket will be directing it with
a headset, like Madonna or whoever.

27:09.813 --> 27:11.273
Fascinating.

27:11.984 --> 27:13.944
How could you get me on the team?

27:14.156 --> 27:15.817
Rocket's sponsoring my BTA.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.946
- BTA?
- Been to America.

27:18.164 --> 27:20.206
In order to come here,
I needed a sponsor.

27:20.419 --> 27:23.043
And now you want to broaden
my surgical horizons, huh?

27:23.676 --> 27:25.671
You really should get to
know him, Peter.

27:26.975 --> 27:29.135
No, no. I...

27:31.025 --> 27:32.485
My plate's full.

27:32.695 --> 27:35.153
- Thank you.
- All right.

27:35.367 --> 27:37.742
I'll let you get back to
your beauty sleep.

27:40.086 --> 27:41.879
Angevine. A-N-G-E-

27:42.090 --> 27:45.878
Anybody see a black male patient,
20 years old, about 6'3"?

27:46.057 --> 27:47.221
No. You lose somebody?

27:47.435 --> 27:49.845
He had on a gray sweat suit.
Nobody saw him?

27:50.065 --> 27:54.282
This is Dr. Carter in the ER. I want
to know about a patient named Angevine.

27:54.491 --> 27:58.909
Emergency incision of a
pheochromocytoma. Romano took him up.

27:59.126 --> 28:00.408
Romano?

28:01.005 --> 28:02.038
What's wrong?

28:02.258 --> 28:05.512
My testicular cancer guy ran away.
The oncologist never saw him.

28:05.724 --> 28:08.134
- Want me to help you?
- No. I'll try this number.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.765
- I think he lives on campus.
- Use this phone.

28:10.943 --> 28:12.772
I can't get anywhere with Surgery.

28:12.947 --> 28:15.987
Dr. Carter, I can't find a vein
on the patient in 4.

28:16.204 --> 28:18.912
- Really?
- Well, he's blown them all.

28:19.127 --> 28:23.628
If you'll all excuse me, I'll put my
education and training to the test...

28:23.804 --> 28:26.594
...by drawing blood from
a heroin addict. Come on, Ivan.

28:26.810 --> 28:28.390
Is Haleh here?

28:28.606 --> 28:30.684
No. She's sick, remember?

28:30.902 --> 28:32.529
No, because today's Thursday.

28:32.740 --> 28:34.319
I know, Pablo!

28:34.493 --> 28:36.619
Haleh's not here today.
Come back tomorrow.

28:36.832 --> 28:40.834
- Okay. I come back later, huh?
- No, mañana. Friday, okay?

28:41.049 --> 28:43.174
Mañana.

28:46.268 --> 28:48.679
Told you, you won't find
nothing there.

28:48.899 --> 28:51.190
How long have you been
an IV drug user?

28:51.362 --> 28:53.571
Since 1977.

28:53.784 --> 28:56.658
Well, there's always a vein somewhere.

28:56.874 --> 29:00.746
Summer of '77, never will forget it.
I was at Charlie Wilson's house.

29:00.966 --> 29:02.961
Old Charlie boy...

29:03.179 --> 29:05.590
...down in the basement, banging.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.894
Like we just invented something.

29:11.363 --> 29:13.655
Told you you wouldn't find nothing.

29:14.620 --> 29:18.457
Warm compresses or a dab of nitro
paste can dilate a hidden vein.

29:18.671 --> 29:22.008
But before we do that, let's find one
in a lower extremity...

29:22.220 --> 29:24.429
...like the saphenous vein in the leg.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.438
- The femoral vein?
- Nope.

29:28.024 --> 29:29.734
Dorsal venous plexus of the foot?

29:30.738 --> 29:32.234
Give it here. I'll find you one.

29:37.628 --> 29:39.788
Thank you. Cotton?

29:59.591 --> 30:01.550
Don't you ever, ever try this.

30:15.208 --> 30:16.584
I screwed up...

30:16.794 --> 30:19.752
...with my testicular cancer patient.
He ran away.

30:19.968 --> 30:21.048
Ran away?

30:21.888 --> 30:24.049
I sent my student out to look for him.

30:24.269 --> 30:26.347
The guy likes to run along
the lakefront.

30:26.565 --> 30:28.893
He's not running
with those mets in his lungs.

30:29.112 --> 30:33.031
I left a message at his dorm.
He'll show up, but...

30:34.707 --> 30:38.579
The thing is, when we do find him
it would be good if he could...

30:38.799 --> 30:41.839
...talk to a man about
the orchiectomy.

30:42.056 --> 30:45.975
Explain that his life's not over
because he's losing a testicle.

30:46.190 --> 30:47.817
Let me know when you find him.

30:48.027 --> 30:50.236
- We got a wild one!
- Give it to me.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.407
ALOC, heavy ETOH odor,
unrousable at scene.

30:53.623 --> 30:56.876
BP 130/80. Sinus rhythm 72.

30:57.088 --> 31:00.793
- O-2 by mask, 10 liters.
- Trauma 1. Cynthia, call Security.

31:00.972 --> 31:03.976
We started an IV, gave D50
and two milligrams of Narcan.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.142
No signs of trauma on scene,
but he awoke...

31:07.319 --> 31:09.479
...became combative,
kicked out the window.

31:09.657 --> 31:11.117
Got a nasty lac here.

31:11.327 --> 31:14.082
- Tough throwing him into restraints.
- Hard leathers!

31:14.292 --> 31:15.836
You can't tie me up like this!

31:16.045 --> 31:17.292
We need as many as we can.

31:17.507 --> 31:19.835
- Hold his head down!
- Ready to move him?

31:20.430 --> 31:21.807
- What's his name?
- McNamara.

31:22.058 --> 31:24.350
Mr. McNamara, stop thrashing around.

31:24.522 --> 31:27.312
Who are you?
I was kidnapped from my house-

31:28.029 --> 31:29.691
Damn you people!

31:29.908 --> 31:31.535
- Hold him down!
- Son of a bitch!

31:31.746 --> 31:33.906
- Get his leg.
- She bit down on her tongue.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.919
You have no right to tie me up!

31:38.009 --> 31:39.041
That's enough!

31:39.303 --> 31:40.764
That's enough, you understand?!

31:40.973 --> 31:42.434
Don't move!

31:43.312 --> 31:45.888
- Don't move! Shut up and don't move!
- Mark!

31:48.907 --> 31:50.367
Go check on Chuny.

31:55.087 --> 31:58.091
All right, we're gonna move
him on the count of three.

31:58.260 --> 32:02.049
Hold him down. One, two, three.

32:02.269 --> 32:04.228
I'm sorry I embarrassed you,
Dr. Carter.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.444
- You didn't.
- Well, I embarrassed myself.

32:08.282 --> 32:11.452
- You get used to this stuff, Ivan.
- How?

32:11.622 --> 32:13.617
Eventually, it doesn't faze you.

32:13.793 --> 32:15.788
What if I can't cut it?

32:16.841 --> 32:20.345
You need to see more. Get a few more
traumas under your belt.

32:20.558 --> 32:23.931
What if my whole life is
a wrong decision?

32:30.454 --> 32:31.736
Dr. Anspaugh.

32:32.166 --> 32:34.208
- How are those dictations?
- Almost finished.

32:34.421 --> 32:36.712
I want to thank you for
the time to catch up...

32:36.926 --> 32:40.014
...and apologize for this morning.
It won't happen again.

32:40.183 --> 32:41.976
I should hope not.

32:42.187 --> 32:46.355
You know, when your son was
in the NICU, everyone gladly...

32:46.530 --> 32:51.493
...bent over to accommodate you
because we all felt sympathy for you.

32:51.833 --> 32:53.543
But now your baby's out
of the hospital...

32:53.712 --> 32:55.338
...and as you've probably noted...

32:55.549 --> 32:59.218
...Dr. Corday has raised the bar
considerably for surgical residents.

32:59.390 --> 33:01.052
Yes. She's talented.

33:01.269 --> 33:05.106
If we don't stay on our toes,
she could make us all look bad.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.413
These grant applications are
making my eyes glaze over.

33:14.589 --> 33:17.297
Who's the nurse at Stoney Island
who started their clinic?

33:17.512 --> 33:19.721
- Ellen Buckley.
- Maybe she'd show me the ropes.

33:19.934 --> 33:22.095
- I'll tell you how she got her grant.
- Really?

33:22.314 --> 33:25.354
No big mystery.
Her dad's a state senator.

33:25.613 --> 33:28.617
Dr. Del Amico? Your patient?

33:28.870 --> 33:30.449
Yeah, that's him. Thanks.

33:30.665 --> 33:33.159
Cynthia? Can you find Dr. Ross
for me, please?

33:33.379 --> 33:34.460
Yeah. Right away.

33:34.674 --> 33:36.799
- Hey, Brett.
- Hey.

33:37.012 --> 33:39.802
- Where'd you go?
- Just walking around.

33:42.315 --> 33:45.023
I know this great doctor.
He's a pediatrician...

33:45.238 --> 33:48.611
...but he's a good person to talk to
with questions you might have.

33:48.829 --> 33:50.325
You won't answer more questions?

33:50.541 --> 33:53.961
No. I thought you might be more
comfortable with a male doctor.

33:54.174 --> 33:56.714
Will he tell me that my left nut's
got to go?

33:56.930 --> 33:58.342
If that's the diagnosis, yes.

33:58.558 --> 34:01.598
I don't care if it's you or whoever.
I just...

34:02.232 --> 34:05.652
I just needed to walk around,
get this all straight in my mind.

34:07.201 --> 34:08.364
Okay.

34:13.339 --> 34:15.880
Do you want me to talk to
that oncologist?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.214
Yeah. I'll take you up there now.

34:18.768 --> 34:20.893
Do you have any family in the area?

34:21.690 --> 34:23.067
Yeah. Milwaukee.

34:25.239 --> 34:26.699
You should call them.

34:41.107 --> 34:43.398
- Can I bum one?
- Yeah.

34:45.616 --> 34:49.072
That was so great the way you
handled that drunken jerk.

34:49.291 --> 34:50.455
I don't know about that.

34:50.668 --> 34:53.958
Nobody else could control him.
You did. I was watching.

34:54.135 --> 34:55.678
Yeah, well...

34:58.185 --> 34:59.978
Can I tell you something, Mark?

35:01.985 --> 35:04.739
I understated when I said
that I give good back rubs.

35:04.949 --> 35:08.203
I give great back rubs.
It's one of the things I'm best at.

35:08.415 --> 35:09.827
Want me to show you?

35:10.210 --> 35:11.492
Here?

35:13.175 --> 35:14.422
Turn around.

35:19.940 --> 35:23.146
Oh, man! You are so tight!

35:23.363 --> 35:25.857
I knew you'd have a really
strong back, though.

35:26.078 --> 35:28.037
That feels great.

35:33.594 --> 35:35.719
It's Alan McConaugha.

35:35.890 --> 35:37.932
The hospital lawyer.

35:38.521 --> 35:40.147
I'd better get going.

35:41.235 --> 35:43.645
- Can I walk with you?
- Sure.

35:48.584 --> 35:51.125
I could never do this.
What was I thinking?

35:51.340 --> 35:53.880
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

35:54.096 --> 35:55.675
Still thinking about a clinic?

35:55.891 --> 35:58.016
You could spend your life
getting this money.

35:58.229 --> 36:01.602
From the government. You should
look into private foundations.

36:02.071 --> 36:03.448
- Private?
- Yeah.

36:03.616 --> 36:04.815
Yeah?

36:05.077 --> 36:06.407
No, no, no. I just want to...

36:06.580 --> 36:09.668
...know if Thomas Angevine is
out of surgery or not.

36:09.879 --> 36:12.088
I was just on hold.
I was just on hold.

36:12.301 --> 36:13.547
Private foundations?

36:13.762 --> 36:17.551
They exist to give money away.
It's that or pay taxes.

36:17.771 --> 36:21.108
Do you think a private foundation
would consider this clinic?

36:22.281 --> 36:25.784
You should hear the nutty ideas
that get pitched to my grandmother.

36:25.997 --> 36:28.241
Wait one second. Yeah?

36:28.460 --> 36:31.465
What do you mean, nobody knows?
Just go down the hall!

36:31.634 --> 36:34.508
Wait, wait. Just tell me
what O.R. they're in.

36:34.724 --> 36:36.434
Okay. Thank you.

36:36.644 --> 36:38.805
Your grandmother's involved
in a foundation?

36:39.943 --> 36:42.152
- I gotta go to Surgery.
- Wait, Carter!

36:42.323 --> 36:45.031
Would your grandmother
consider this clinic idea?

36:45.246 --> 36:48.833
If you put something down on paper,
she'd probably look at it. Yeah.

36:51.843 --> 36:55.133
Have there been previous lawsuits
alleging malpractice by you?

36:55.351 --> 36:57.013
Yes. One.

36:57.188 --> 37:01.736
Isn't it true that in the spring
of 1995, a Mrs. Jodi O'Brian...

37:01.948 --> 37:05.119
...a healthy 29-year-old,
pregnant with her first child...

37:05.330 --> 37:07.325
...died from your misdiagnosis?

37:07.544 --> 37:09.289
No. Her medical course was-

37:09.798 --> 37:11.378
You answered the question.

37:11.552 --> 37:15.934
Following the death of Mrs. O'Brian,
did you express feelings of guilt?

37:16.145 --> 37:17.226
Not that I recall.

37:17.398 --> 37:19.892
- Did you, in fact, feel guilty?
- Guilty? No.

37:20.237 --> 37:23.277
What word would better describe
your state of mind?

37:23.494 --> 37:24.575
Regret.

37:24.872 --> 37:29.670
Did this regretful feeling reflect
the quality of care you provided?

37:29.883 --> 37:33.256
No. It happens here all the time.
People die, we feel horrible.

37:33.432 --> 37:35.593
- You felt horrible when Kenny died?
- No!

37:36.188 --> 37:39.477
Mr. Law, you're here as a courtesy.
We can cut this short now.

37:39.695 --> 37:42.023
Please refrain from commenting.

37:42.242 --> 37:44.451
I put a question to you, Dr. Greene.

37:45.625 --> 37:47.251
Ask it again.

37:47.963 --> 37:51.882
Did you feel horrible after Kenny Law
died after you treated him?

37:52.097 --> 37:53.509
I felt regret. Yes.

37:53.725 --> 37:55.934
Did you apply the same
care to Kenny Law...

37:56.147 --> 37:59.151
...as to the white teenager brought
in five minutes before?

37:59.362 --> 38:00.478
- Yes.
- It's a lie!

38:00.698 --> 38:02.658
Do something about your client.

38:02.828 --> 38:04.621
- He's lying!
- Be quiet!

38:04.832 --> 38:07.290
You're in no position
to accuse me of anything!

38:07.504 --> 38:09.048
You of all people!

38:12.849 --> 38:15.557
Dr. Greene, do you hold the life
of a black man...

38:15.772 --> 38:18.182
...to be of lesser value than that
of a white man?

38:18.570 --> 38:19.852
What kind of question is that?

38:20.073 --> 38:21.105
Will you answer it?

38:21.284 --> 38:23.195
People die. I'm human.
I'm fallible.

38:23.413 --> 38:25.159
You see yourself as fallible?

38:25.376 --> 38:27.870
- Don't twist my words.
- About your fallibility.

38:28.048 --> 38:30.542
When this black man was
brought into the ER-

38:30.721 --> 38:34.390
You want me to say that I'm a racist?
I'm a racist, all right?

38:34.562 --> 38:37.234
Do you feel better about
almost beating me to death?

38:37.485 --> 38:40.109
- Will that bring your son back?
- Don't point at her!

38:40.324 --> 38:42.485
We're taking a break.
We're stopping now.

38:42.704 --> 38:46.077
Talking about regret? You never
expressed regret to my mother!

38:46.254 --> 38:47.418
You belong in jail.

38:47.590 --> 38:49.965
I wish it was me who kicked
your white ass!

38:55.607 --> 38:57.935
Dr. Carter, coming back to Surgery?

38:58.112 --> 38:59.858
I just came to pay a visit.

39:00.075 --> 39:03.412
- We miss you up here.
- Did you work on the pheo with Romano?

39:03.624 --> 39:06.664
- Yes. Dr. Edson did the procedure.
- He did?

39:06.881 --> 39:10.753
Are you looking for him?
I think he's in the Waiting Room.

39:10.973 --> 39:12.635
Okay, thanks.

39:12.977 --> 39:14.771
Honey, settle.
Thank him, sweetie.

39:14.981 --> 39:17.902
- This doctor saved your daddy's life.
- Thank you, doctor.

39:18.113 --> 39:20.654
I heard Dr. Romano let you
do the procedure.

39:20.827 --> 39:23.238
That's right.
It was a total success.

39:23.458 --> 39:24.574
When can I see Tom?

39:24.794 --> 39:27.632
He's been moved to ICU.
I can take you down there.

39:27.842 --> 39:29.884
- Great.
- Hi. I'm Dr. Carter.

39:30.097 --> 39:32.175
Were you part of the surgical team?

39:32.477 --> 39:34.472
No. I wasn't.

39:34.690 --> 39:37.694
I saw your husband when he came into
the Emergency Room.

39:40.285 --> 39:41.698
- I'm glad it went well.
- Thanks.

39:41.914 --> 39:44.039
- ICU's this way.
- Thanks, Dr. Edson.

39:44.210 --> 39:45.754
Come on, sweetie.

39:58.115 --> 40:00.406
- I'll meet you there.
- Last call for football.

40:00.578 --> 40:01.908
See you soon.

40:03.126 --> 40:04.621
- Hi, Pablo.
- Is Haleh here?

40:04.838 --> 40:06.916
- No, I'll do you this time.
- Haleh not here?

40:07.134 --> 40:10.423
- No. You get Carol today.
- Oh, Carol. Okay.

40:11.602 --> 40:13.846
Mark, how'd it go
with the lawyer?

40:14.066 --> 40:15.229
I don't know.

40:15.402 --> 40:16.434
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

40:16.654 --> 40:18.483
Hang on 10 minutes.
I'll go with you.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.280
See you tomorrow, Doug.

40:21.540 --> 40:22.952
You know what, Liz?

40:23.168 --> 40:25.163
I'll want you handling
the laser tomorrow.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.136
While you control the Aesop 2000?
Terrific.

40:28.346 --> 40:30.008
Don't act too surprised.

40:30.225 --> 40:32.350
Peter, fantastic.
Now I can introduce you.

40:32.563 --> 40:34.225
Peter Benton, Rocket Romano.

40:34.442 --> 40:37.612
Dr. Benton. Hey, Lizzie's
talked about you.

40:37.824 --> 40:39.950
- It's a pleasure.
- Tell me something.

40:40.413 --> 40:42.408
Do you think Chris Rock is funny?

40:42.710 --> 40:45.120
- Excuse me?
- The comedian Chris Rock?

40:45.340 --> 40:48.511
Did that HBO special.
Must've used the "N" word 50 times.

40:48.681 --> 40:51.175
"N" word this and that.
Calling him a genius.

40:51.395 --> 40:55.183
If I used the "N" word, you'd
probably want to smack me, right?

40:55.445 --> 40:57.487
I think Chris Rock is hilarious.

40:59.496 --> 41:00.528
Good to meet you.

41:00.748 --> 41:02.244
Have a good night.

41:05.300 --> 41:07.294
You're right. I like him.

41:08.431 --> 41:10.972
- Feeling better now?
- Yeah, I'm feeling better.

41:11.187 --> 41:13.562
- All nice and clean?
- Yeah.

41:14.068 --> 41:16.479
Now Haleh listens to my chest.

41:16.657 --> 41:17.689
Why?

41:17.910 --> 41:20.998
- So my pneumonia doesn't come back.
- You had pneumonia?

41:21.208 --> 41:22.585
Twice.

41:25.092 --> 41:28.096
I want you to take a nice deep
breath for me, all right?

41:30.144 --> 41:31.426
And again.

41:33.359 --> 41:34.903
Sounds good.

41:36.449 --> 41:38.278
Pablo?

41:38.453 --> 41:40.614
If there was a clinic
in the ER...

41:40.834 --> 41:43.624
...where you could get checkups
and medicine...

41:43.798 --> 41:45.378
...do you think you'd come?

41:45.928 --> 41:48.303
- Free clinic?
- Yeah.

41:48.517 --> 41:50.761
- Would Haleh be there?
- I bet she would.

41:50.980 --> 41:53.141
I like it.
Yeah, I would come.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.106
Okay, Pablo.

41:59.456 --> 42:01.831
- Hey, Carter.
- Hi.

42:02.004 --> 42:04.331
Anything new and exciting
happening in the ER?

42:04.509 --> 42:08.428
- I diagnosed a pheochromocytoma.
- You serious?

42:08.643 --> 42:10.971
Patient crashed, they took him
up to Surgery.

42:11.190 --> 42:13.351
Dale did the procedure.
He did pretty good.

42:13.528 --> 42:14.988
Dale's a weasel.

42:15.198 --> 42:16.480
Excuse me?

42:17.119 --> 42:20.289
Carter, you're twice the surgeon
Dale will ever be.

42:20.501 --> 42:21.582
Thanks.

42:21.796 --> 42:23.173
Busy day for you?

42:23.716 --> 42:27.136
Anspaugh got on my case about
some delinquent charts.

42:27.307 --> 42:30.727
Bummer. So are you
enjoying fatherhood?

42:32.235 --> 42:33.315
Yeah.

42:33.529 --> 42:36.736
Yeah, I am.
Good night, Carter.

42:37.746 --> 42:38.827
Good night.

42:40.126 --> 42:41.242
Congratulations, my man.

42:41.463 --> 42:44.383
My luck's changing.
Send over two ginger ales.

42:44.594 --> 42:45.675
You got it.

42:49.313 --> 42:51.604
I thought it was gonna be no gambling.

42:52.945 --> 42:54.940
What? It's just the bar pool.

42:55.158 --> 42:57.237
You're not gonna complain now.
It's $200.

42:57.455 --> 42:59.497
We just have to be careful
with our money.

42:59.710 --> 43:02.667
Look, don't spoil this for me, okay?

43:04.846 --> 43:06.472
Billy Nelson just came in.

43:07.936 --> 43:09.479
- Give me a cold one.
- Sure.

43:15.744 --> 43:17.655
You talk to him since the accident?

43:17.957 --> 43:19.334
About what?

43:20.212 --> 43:22.622
The drugs he needs
over the next six months...

43:22.842 --> 43:25.467
...in the off chance I gave him HIV.

43:26.266 --> 43:28.178
- We haven't talked.
- He's staring at us.

43:28.354 --> 43:31.561
- I'll say something.
- Just drink your ginger ale, okay?

43:31.778 --> 43:33.856
- He is your friend.
- That's how I know.

43:36.413 --> 43:38.538
If I was in his place...

43:41.215 --> 43:43.970
Hey, Al? How'd you get it?

43:44.764 --> 43:47.222
Hey, Al, how'd you get it?
In the arm?

43:49.649 --> 43:51.858
Did you get it through the vein
or the booty?

43:52.029 --> 43:53.062
I want to know!

43:57.875 --> 43:59.371
Bill, let's just talk-

43:59.587 --> 44:01.713
Sit down, bitch!
I ain't talking to you!

44:02.009 --> 44:04.170
Who are you talking to?
That's my wife!

44:04.389 --> 44:05.801
You're gonna be a man now?

44:06.018 --> 44:07.181
Yeah, that's right!

44:07.395 --> 44:10.934
You got AIDS and you gave it to
your wife! Tried to give it to me!

44:11.153 --> 44:12.733
Not in here. Not in here!

44:12.949 --> 44:14.279
Please take me home.

44:14.452 --> 44:16.696
Get out before I do
what I feel like doing.

44:16.916 --> 44:19.624
- Walk away, Al.
- What you want to do?

44:19.839 --> 44:21.418
Come on, Al.

44:23.179 --> 44:24.675
That's what I thought.

44:25.601 --> 44:27.394
Faggot!

44:27.897 --> 44:29.013
Wait.

44:29.651 --> 44:30.767
- No, Al!
- Come on!

44:30.987 --> 44:32.020
Come on!

44:34.912 --> 44:35.945
Stop it!

44:36.833 --> 44:37.866
Stop it!

44:38.796 --> 44:40.291
Stop it, Al!

44:43.556 --> 44:45.681
Stop it. Al, stop it!

44:49.360 --> 44:50.690
Stop it, Al.

44:51.197 --> 44:52.527
Stop it!
