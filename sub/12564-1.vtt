Previously, on <i>Royal Pains</i>...

00:03.836 --> 00:05.500
Smile!
[Chuckles]

00:05.525 --> 00:07.272
What you did was very impulsive.

00:07.297 --> 00:08.725
Divya, you made a mistake.

00:08.750 --> 00:11.785
Divya and I have a... a completely
professional relationship.

00:11.810 --> 00:14.145
Do you have feelings for her?

00:14.176 --> 00:16.338
- Jeremiah!
- I don't have feelings.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.915
Doctor Lawson... meet Dimitry Vasiliev.

00:18.940 --> 00:21.595
I can treat him. Just don't
ask me to trust him.

00:21.620 --> 00:24.156
I know Dima far too well to ask that.

00:24.181 --> 00:26.241
Just keep an eye on him, Hank.

00:26.266 --> 00:27.655
Where is Boris?

00:27.680 --> 00:30.480
The door appears to have been locked
from the inside! Bring him out...

00:33.099 --> 00:34.863
Hello, doctor Lawson.

00:34.888 --> 00:37.293
Start counting backwards from 100...

00:37.318 --> 00:38.963
One hundred...

00:38.991 --> 00:40.991
ninety-nine...

[Sighs]

01:00.232 --> 01:02.851
Fingers nice and spread out.
Now push against my palms.

01:02.852 --> 01:04.885
Okay.

01:04.887 --> 01:06.187
[Grunts]

01:06.188 --> 01:08.073
Okay. Your neuro exam checks out great.

01:08.074 --> 01:11.893
Doc, please, just level with me.

01:11.894 --> 01:14.279
Will I ever play the violin again?

01:14.280 --> 01:16.230
Hank, the bone has fused.

01:16.231 --> 01:17.949
You've resorbed the extravasated blood,

01:17.950 --> 01:19.451
your mental function is back to normal.

01:19.452 --> 01:21.402
But I'm sorry...

01:21.403 --> 01:24.339
We couldn't save your sense of humor.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.007
After six months of part-time doctoring,

01:26.008 --> 01:27.959
as long as I can get back
to my full schedule,

01:27.960 --> 01:30.044
that is one side effect
I'm willing to live with.

01:30.045 --> 01:31.245
- Great.
- Thanks, doc.

01:31.246 --> 01:32.680
Okay.

01:32.681 --> 01:34.248
And don't forget,
no driving until you've been

01:34.249 --> 01:36.351
off the anti-seizure meds for a month.

01:36.352 --> 01:40.388
Speaking of driving,
a doctor, a rabbi, and a chimp...

01:40.389 --> 01:42.023
no jokes. Got it.

01:42.024 --> 01:44.642
- Bye, doc.
- Bye.

01:54.453 --> 01:56.437
Thank you.

02:00.209 --> 02:02.744
So the doctor said he's supposed
to wake up by day three,

02:02.745 --> 02:04.111
and it's day four.

02:04.112 --> 02:06.080
Is that... that's not weird, right?

02:06.081 --> 02:08.716
He had a craniotomy, Evan.

02:08.717 --> 02:12.286
Hank needs to recover,
and we need to be patient.

02:12.287 --> 02:15.974
Right. Right.

02:15.975 --> 02:17.759
So what's with the scar?

02:17.760 --> 02:19.126
Are you worried about him having it

02:19.127 --> 02:21.146
or you having to look at it?

02:21.147 --> 02:24.599
A little bit of both.

02:35.244 --> 02:38.312
Okay now, Dr. Turner,
you'll go to Mr. Appel's,

02:38.313 --> 02:40.081
who's having a flare-up with his gout

02:40.082 --> 02:43.284
and then to the grant family
to handle their annual physical.

02:43.285 --> 02:44.669
Okay.

02:44.670 --> 02:46.921
Dr. Moore, I need you
to assess Mr. Pinson's neck pain

02:46.922 --> 02:49.707
in pine neck... say that five times fast.

02:49.708 --> 02:52.877
Doctors, please call with
any updates as you have them,

02:52.878 --> 02:55.430
and I will alert you
with any new appointments.

02:55.431 --> 02:57.015
- Thank you.
- Bye.

02:57.016 --> 02:59.017
- Bye.
- Thanks.

02:59.018 --> 03:02.303
- Hi.
- Heh.

03:02.304 --> 03:05.056
Hey.

03:05.057 --> 03:06.941
Oh, my God, I love your new hair.

03:06.942 --> 03:09.561
Thank you. Was that
"Hankmed The Musical"?

03:09.562 --> 03:11.196
[Groans]

03:11.197 --> 03:14.199
Hank is still recovering,
and the ER is still shut down.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.284
So I had to add a few more associates.

03:16.285 --> 03:18.185
Oh. Well, we're gonna
need a cafeteria soon.

03:18.186 --> 03:20.021
Uh, well, they're usually
just here in the mornings

03:20.022 --> 03:21.706
and some afternoons.

03:21.707 --> 03:24.709
Well, they can sleep over
if they want, because Evan

03:24.710 --> 03:26.360
has been house hunting.

03:26.361 --> 03:27.912
- You guys are moving out?
- Yup.

03:27.913 --> 03:30.031
He's gonna show me
the top choices this weekend,

03:30.032 --> 03:31.032
right, babe?

03:31.033 --> 03:32.634
Oh, yes!

03:32.635 --> 03:34.052
Yes, it's gonna be like,
uh, <i>million dollar listing.</i>

03:34.053 --> 03:37.222
Without the million dollars, obviously.

03:37.223 --> 03:40.391
So, um, how are you?

03:40.392 --> 03:42.810
I was so bummed to get
your email about Rafa.

03:42.811 --> 03:44.429
I wasn't bummed to send it.

03:44.430 --> 03:49.383
I care about Rafa truly,
but when he visited last month

03:49.384 --> 03:51.486
I finally realized
that we are only compatible

03:51.487 --> 03:53.438
in one way.

03:53.439 --> 03:56.858
At least our last weekend
together was very memorable.

03:56.859 --> 03:58.526
Well, I'm glad to hear things ended

03:58.527 --> 04:00.278
as passionately as they started.

04:00.279 --> 04:02.497
[Cell phone rings]

04:02.498 --> 04:03.998
Hey! Look who's home from school.

04:03.999 --> 04:05.833
Hey! Look who's ready for summer!

04:05.834 --> 04:09.254
Well, yeah, ready-ish.

04:09.255 --> 04:11.923
So you sure you're up
for resuming your full schedule?

04:11.924 --> 04:13.875
Yeah. I'm sure, Ev.

04:13.876 --> 04:16.410
Okay, that's great.
How was your appointment?

04:16.411 --> 04:19.180
- Couldn't have gone better.
- Awesome.

04:19.180 --> 04:21.298
Hank, it's Ms. Newberg.
[Phone ringing]

04:21.300 --> 04:23.968
Her scalp itches. Welcome home.

04:23.969 --> 04:25.603
- Ms. New...
- No, no, hold on.

04:25.604 --> 04:28.056
That's beneath your pay grade.
It's... here's Divya again.

04:28.057 --> 04:30.975
So how much longer
will the E.R. be closed?

04:30.976 --> 04:32.259
A week, a month, all summer.

04:32.260 --> 04:34.362
A company called symphony is negotiating

04:34.363 --> 04:35.947
to buy the hospital,
but the regulatory approval

04:35.948 --> 04:37.198
is taking forever.

04:37.199 --> 04:38.483
So not so much relaxing this summer.

04:38.484 --> 04:41.402
[Phone rings]
This is Hank.

04:41.403 --> 04:43.154
Yeah. I'm on my way.

04:43.155 --> 04:44.739
- On your way where?
- Yup. Where are you?

04:44.740 --> 04:47.408
H... Henry? Henry. Henry.

04:47.409 --> 04:48.960
Divya, initiate Hankwatch. I repeat.

04:48.961 --> 04:51.245
Do not repeat. I'm on it.

04:52.998 --> 04:56.301
Did you forget that you're
not supposed to be driving yet?

04:56.302 --> 04:59.453
No, uh, I was going
to sit in the passenger seat

04:59.454 --> 05:01.089
- and wait for you.
- Ah.

05:01.090 --> 05:03.224
Oh, yeah, we should take your car.

05:05.477 --> 05:09.296
- Dimitry's back.
- Yeah. In Boris's car.

05:11.850 --> 05:13.735
Yeah, soon.

05:16.772 --> 05:18.639
Do you really think
he had something to do

05:18.640 --> 05:20.408
- with Boris's death?
- I don't know.

05:20.409 --> 05:22.476
But I'm gonna find out.

05:22.501 --> 05:26.501

Sync and corrections by atrn97g

05:29.858 --> 05:31.942
Hey, Divs, don't tell Hank
it's me, all right?

05:31.943 --> 05:33.810
He might start to smell Hankwatch.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.947
Use yes or no answers.
Do you understand?

05:36.948 --> 05:38.499
Perfect. Just like that.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.818
All right, so first of all,
after I basically stalked

05:41.819 --> 05:44.872
the life insurance company
for two months, to no avail,

05:44.873 --> 05:47.708
Paige, with one phone call,
got the meeting scheduled

05:47.709 --> 05:49.493
for this afternoon.

05:49.494 --> 05:51.378
Can you believe that?

05:51.379 --> 05:55.332
Secondly, I know our schedule
is officially

05:55.333 --> 05:57.685
bursting at the seams right now,
but it's fine, okay?

05:57.686 --> 05:58.936
It's fine.

05:58.937 --> 06:02.556
I just want you to know
that we can handle it.

06:02.557 --> 06:05.059
As long as patients don't
start dropping out of the sky.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.193
[Screams]

06:06.194 --> 06:11.198
Oh, my God!
[Moans]

06:11.199 --> 06:13.233
Excuse me! Are you all right?

06:14.452 --> 06:16.236
I think your brother overreacted.

06:16.237 --> 06:18.522
No. Come on.
No such thing for a Ballard.

06:18.523 --> 06:21.325
She's a Ballard, Henry,
of "the Ballards."

06:21.326 --> 06:22.692
Yup. Caught the name, Ev.

06:22.693 --> 06:24.244
No, her family started the Hamptons.

06:24.245 --> 06:26.163
See, he is prone to exaggeration.

06:26.164 --> 06:27.631
You're a quick study, Ms. Ballard.

06:27.632 --> 06:29.216
As well as this
little swap meet they call

06:29.217 --> 06:31.034
the New York Stock Exchange.

06:31.035 --> 06:33.470
I stand by my decision
not to leave a fallen Ballard

06:33.471 --> 06:35.139
lying in the grass.

06:35.140 --> 06:36.807
Especially since calling 911 right now

06:36.808 --> 06:38.058
means an ambulance pilgrimage

06:38.059 --> 06:39.709
to the next closest E.R. in Riverhead.

06:39.710 --> 06:40.978
I appreciate your chivalry,

06:40.979 --> 06:43.647
but no 911 call
would have been necessary.

06:43.648 --> 06:44.932
I'm afraid it would have.

06:44.933 --> 06:46.216
Ms. Ballard, your hand is turning blue

06:46.217 --> 06:47.384
and there's no pulse.

06:47.385 --> 06:49.186
We need to address this right now.

06:49.187 --> 06:51.155
Address it how, exactly?

06:51.156 --> 06:53.774
- This is gonna hurt.
- Whoa. Does it have to?

06:53.775 --> 06:55.909
I mean, is there, like,
some kind of less painful

06:55.910 --> 06:57.444
super vip version of this?

06:57.445 --> 07:00.330
Why don't we get each other
through this little ordeal?

07:00.331 --> 07:03.233
Okay, here we go.

07:05.570 --> 07:06.870
Ms. Ballard, my hand...

07:06.871 --> 07:07.904
[Cracking]
Ooh!

07:10.408 --> 07:12.793
Hank? The machine's warmed up.

07:12.794 --> 07:15.129
Okay. Ms. Ballard,
we need to take an X-ray now

07:15.130 --> 07:17.681
to make sure it's back in place
and to rule out a fracture.

07:17.682 --> 07:19.216
You have that equipment here?

07:19.217 --> 07:21.268
Oh, yeah, we have all kinds
of equipment here.

07:21.269 --> 07:23.253
We're prepared for pretty much anything.

07:23.254 --> 07:25.939
I'd heard about Hankmed,
but I had no idea

07:25.940 --> 07:28.976
you had this sort of operation
on the premises.

07:28.977 --> 07:33.564
Yup. A full-service, 24-7
concierge medical facility.

07:33.565 --> 07:36.200
- Would you like a brochure?
- I'd love one.

07:36.201 --> 07:37.868
Really?

07:37.869 --> 07:40.370
Okay, Ms. Ballard, please have a seat.

07:48.296 --> 07:50.947
Looking good, Tom. How's your back?

07:50.948 --> 07:52.949
Slowly catching up to my front.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.585
- Good to see you, Hank.
- You too, Divya.

07:54.586 --> 07:56.970
- Yes.
- Sorry about the chaos here.

07:56.971 --> 08:00.057
As you know, it's my annual
Hamptons Heritage fund-raiser.

08:00.058 --> 08:01.341
What's the hook this year?

08:01.342 --> 08:03.010
Oh, you guys will appreciate this.

08:03.011 --> 08:05.295
It's a fashion show
with a medical theme.

08:05.296 --> 08:08.765
- The healing power of fashion.
- Uh, fashion heals?

08:08.766 --> 08:10.484
Only if this thing
can actually get the E.R. doors

08:10.485 --> 08:11.935
open again.

08:11.936 --> 08:14.571
I thought that would happen
when the approval goes through.

08:14.572 --> 08:16.607
Look, we're speeding the process along

08:16.608 --> 08:18.192
as fast as we can.

08:18.193 --> 08:21.028
In the meantime this community
needs an E.R..

08:21.029 --> 08:22.979
We can't rely on Hankmed
to just, you know,

08:22.980 --> 08:25.616
take care of everyone, right?

08:25.617 --> 08:27.784
- Business has been brisk.
- Oh, okay.

08:27.785 --> 08:30.337
But now, what seems to be bothering you?

08:30.338 --> 08:31.788
Oh, it's not me. It's my wife.

08:31.789 --> 08:34.323
- You got married?
- In March.

08:34.325 --> 08:36.043
Everything's been happening so fast.

08:36.044 --> 08:38.995
I never thought marriage
was for me until I met my Erika.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.330
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

08:40.331 --> 08:41.798
So what's happening with Erika?

08:41.799 --> 08:43.332
She's trying her hand at fashion design.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.801
She loves to sew.

08:44.802 --> 08:46.803
So I convinced her
to put a few of her designs

08:46.804 --> 08:48.055
up here on the runway.

08:48.056 --> 08:49.690
So it's a big night for everyone.

08:49.691 --> 08:51.275
Well, maybe too big.

08:51.276 --> 08:54.061
As I was saying,
she's been working so hard,

08:54.062 --> 08:56.196
I think she's making herself sick.

08:56.197 --> 08:58.815
She's been dizzy, coughing.
Something's not right.

08:58.816 --> 09:00.701
Hey! Oh, are you guys with the DJ...

09:00.702 --> 09:02.903
no, honey... honey, come here.

09:02.904 --> 09:06.356
- All right.
- I want you to meet Dr. Lawson.

09:06.357 --> 09:08.742
- Hi.
- And Divya, his P.A.

09:08.743 --> 09:10.410
And by meet, I take it you mean,

09:10.411 --> 09:12.045
"please be examined by."

09:12.046 --> 09:15.582
Honey, I told you I'm fine.
No, you're not.

09:15.583 --> 09:16.884
And don't worry.
[Cell phone rings]

09:16.885 --> 09:18.535
He's not going
to interrupt you very long.

09:18.536 --> 09:20.804
She's on a very tight schedule
for the show.

09:20.805 --> 09:23.840
Sorry, I do have to take this.
I love you.

09:23.841 --> 09:25.642
- Talk to you later.
- Bye, Tom.

09:25.643 --> 09:27.144
All right, if we have to do
this, could you come with me?

09:27.145 --> 09:28.878
- Of course.
- Thanks.

09:28.879 --> 09:30.046
Thank you for coming,

09:30.047 --> 09:32.482
but he's just being overly cautious.

09:32.483 --> 09:34.601
Too bad he's not like that
on a snowboard.

09:34.602 --> 09:36.320
You were there when Tom broke his back?

09:36.321 --> 09:38.071
Mmhm. I used to be an RN.

09:38.072 --> 09:39.740
- You were a nurse.
- Mm-hmm.

09:39.741 --> 09:43.610
- You were his nurse.
- Feel free to raise an eyebrow.

09:43.611 --> 09:47.164
I did.

09:47.165 --> 09:49.449
Welcome to my home away from home,

09:49.450 --> 09:51.501
which happens to be in my home.

09:51.502 --> 09:53.787
Tom converted his wine cellar for me.

09:53.788 --> 09:58.041
We had to drink
all the bottles really fast.

09:58.042 --> 10:01.345
- It is gorgeous.
- Thank you.

10:01.346 --> 10:03.597
Do you mind me asking,
if you were a nurse,

10:03.598 --> 10:05.098
how did you get into fashion?

10:05.099 --> 10:08.468
Well, let's use the word,
"fashion" loosely.

10:08.469 --> 10:10.053
[Sewing machine whirring]

10:10.054 --> 10:12.723
When people stay in hospitals,
they can often feel like

10:12.724 --> 10:16.143
they've lost their identity,
and hospital gowns don't help.

10:16.144 --> 10:18.895
I couldn't stand seeing
my patients in them,

10:18.896 --> 10:22.449
so uncomfortable and exposed,
so I came up with these.

10:22.450 --> 10:24.151
Patient pajamas.

10:24.152 --> 10:27.120
It became a hobby, a way for me to relax

10:27.121 --> 10:29.957
after finishing a double shift.

10:29.958 --> 10:32.542
And now Tom is making
my dreams come true.

10:32.543 --> 10:36.330
[Coughs]

10:36.331 --> 10:40.116
Erika, any hemoptysis or dyspnea?

10:40.117 --> 10:41.718
- No.
- Are...

10:41.719 --> 10:43.170
and I'm not producing any sputum either.

10:43.171 --> 10:44.304
Because...

10:44.305 --> 10:45.789
and if I did it would be clear.

10:45.790 --> 10:47.674
Yup. We'd like to run some blood anyway.

10:47.675 --> 10:49.125
And give you an antitussive
for the cough.

10:49.126 --> 10:53.013
- And ask when you plan to rest.
- When the runway show is set.

10:53.014 --> 10:55.015
I still have a few pieces
left to finish,

10:55.016 --> 10:58.769
and they have to be perfect.

10:58.770 --> 11:00.771
It is for the hospital, right?

11:00.772 --> 11:02.939
Well, we support your cause,
so we're happy to grant you

11:02.940 --> 11:04.641
a few extra hours of manual labor.

11:04.642 --> 11:07.661
As long as your blood work
comes back normal.

11:07.662 --> 11:12.165
That house is cute.

11:12.166 --> 11:15.485
- Is that it?
- No, I think it's this one.

11:15.486 --> 11:17.587
Oh.

11:17.588 --> 11:21.157
- They must be moving out.
- Yeah.

11:23.044 --> 11:24.294
Huh?

11:24.295 --> 11:26.680
[Gasps]
Evan, it's beautiful.

11:26.681 --> 11:29.883
- Right?
- [Giggles] I love it.

11:29.884 --> 11:31.167
I'm glad.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.136
But wait, wait, wait.

11:33.137 --> 11:35.605
Why are they moving furniture
into the house?

11:35.606 --> 11:37.057
Maybe it rented already.

11:37.058 --> 11:40.227
Well, why would it be rented
if you had an appointment?

11:40.228 --> 11:43.146
Because I didn't make an appointment.

11:43.147 --> 11:44.314
You didn't tell them we were coming?

11:44.315 --> 11:45.849
I'm sorry, I forgot.

11:45.850 --> 11:51.455
[Sighs] Okay. Uh, well,
show me your second favorite.

11:51.456 --> 11:54.074
That was my second favorite.

11:54.075 --> 11:56.410
How many places have you seen?

11:56.411 --> 11:58.078
I thought about looking more,

11:58.079 --> 12:00.964
but the guest house is not just my home,

12:00.965 --> 12:02.716
it's my office.

12:02.717 --> 12:06.470
And the E.R. is closed,
and Hankwatch is on overdrive,

12:06.471 --> 12:08.889
so Hankmed is just really
overwhelmed right now.

12:08.890 --> 12:12.592
Evan, we've barely seen
each other all winter.

12:12.593 --> 12:14.845
You've been slammed at work

12:14.846 --> 12:18.047
and I've been overwhelmed
at school... that's fine.

12:18.048 --> 12:20.767
But we can't keep putting
our marriage on hold.

12:20.768 --> 12:23.019
You and I are starting our own journey,

12:23.020 --> 12:25.355
and we need to do that
together... and alone.

12:27.892 --> 12:29.893
Uh...

12:36.200 --> 12:38.735
[Sighs]
Thank you, my man.

12:43.958 --> 12:45.425
- Hey.
- You're late.

12:45.426 --> 12:47.761
I know, sorry. Paige and I had a thing.

12:47.762 --> 12:49.463
Oh. Want to talk about it?

12:49.464 --> 12:50.680
No, it wasn't like...

12:50.681 --> 12:51.848
it was just
a little bumpy on the reentry.

12:51.849 --> 12:53.249
Okay.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.434
And how has your reentry been so far?

12:54.435 --> 12:56.303
Smooth. Real smooth.

12:56.304 --> 12:58.605
Don't we usually grab lunch
on the fly when we're this busy?

12:58.606 --> 13:00.440
We've actually never been this busy.

13:00.441 --> 13:01.975
So...

13:01.976 --> 13:03.193
That's why I think
it's important that we start

13:03.194 --> 13:04.978
making time for an energy boost
here and there.

13:04.979 --> 13:06.530
Divya didn't come in for a boost.

13:06.531 --> 13:07.697
Exactly. You want to be like her?

13:07.698 --> 13:10.099
'Cause I don't.
[Both chuckling]

13:10.100 --> 13:13.653
Just sit back and relax, man.
Relax, Henry, seriously.

13:13.654 --> 13:15.872
Enjoy your acai-hemp-chia juice.

13:15.873 --> 13:17.507
Thank you so much.

13:19.610 --> 13:21.495
Oh! That tastes healthy.

13:21.496 --> 13:24.113
- It is.
- Good.

13:24.114 --> 13:25.465
Listen, thank you.

13:25.466 --> 13:26.917
Thanks for keeping Hankmed
running so well

13:26.918 --> 13:28.418
while I was recovering.

13:28.419 --> 13:29.886
Yeah, no problem.

13:29.887 --> 13:33.423
I was actually surprised
at how smooth it went.

13:33.424 --> 13:36.510
Hello.

13:36.511 --> 13:39.012
Um, I don't think
I have any change, my friend.

13:39.013 --> 13:41.815
- Jeremiah.
- No.

13:41.816 --> 13:45.318
Oh, my God! You look like a wookiee.

13:45.319 --> 13:47.437
- Uh...
- Wow, look at you!

13:47.438 --> 13:50.106
You're like a whole new man.

13:50.107 --> 13:52.325
Oh, my God, come here!

13:52.326 --> 13:55.745
Oh, yeah, that.
Uh, partially a whole new man.

13:55.746 --> 13:57.364
What happened in Iceland?

13:57.365 --> 13:59.148
And please don't say,
"what happens in Iceland"

13:59.149 --> 14:00.617
"stays in Iceland."

14:00.618 --> 14:02.652
It didn't occur to me to say that.

14:02.653 --> 14:03.987
[Laughs]

14:03.988 --> 14:07.040
Sit down. Sit down.

14:09.460 --> 14:13.597
Divya's not here.

14:13.598 --> 14:16.099
So tell us all about the beard.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.934
Oh, I came straight from jfk
when I got Evan's text

14:17.935 --> 14:19.669
about how busy you are,
but if there's time

14:19.670 --> 14:21.805
before appointments, I can get a shave.

14:21.806 --> 14:23.473
Oh, no, no, no. I just meant what...

14:23.474 --> 14:24.975
what inspired it?

14:24.976 --> 14:27.110
Like, did your research
involve sasquatch?

14:27.111 --> 14:29.012
Actually it centered
on endocrine disruptors

14:29.013 --> 14:31.314
like diethylstilbestrol,
and how it enhances the...

14:31.315 --> 14:34.017
okay, that... yeah,
that's not interesting.

14:34.018 --> 14:35.952
My girlfriend thinks it is.

14:35.953 --> 14:37.454
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.

14:37.455 --> 14:39.406
- Well, that is interesting.
- Yeah, tell us all about her.

14:39.407 --> 14:41.875
Is she Icelandic?

14:41.876 --> 14:44.828
I'd rather not discuss her.

14:46.697 --> 14:48.698
[Laughs]
Seriously.

14:48.699 --> 14:51.084
A grizzly Adams and a girlfriend.

14:51.085 --> 14:53.303
- I know.
- Like, who was that guy?

14:53.304 --> 14:55.805
Who are you? Since when
do we eat in a vegan joint?

14:55.806 --> 14:57.707
I had brain surgery, not a heart attack.

14:57.708 --> 15:00.427
Okay...

15:00.428 --> 15:03.897
I'm the one who almost
had the heart attack.

15:03.898 --> 15:06.650
I told you how terrifying it was
for me to see you like that...

15:06.651 --> 15:09.436
I know, Ev. I was there too.

15:09.437 --> 15:14.741
But I'm fine now, okay?

15:14.742 --> 15:16.243
Yeah.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.396
[Sighs]

15:27.905 --> 15:31.041
Boris? Boris?

15:35.129 --> 15:36.263
Oh.

15:36.264 --> 15:38.131
Hey.

15:38.132 --> 15:41.268
[Slurring] When are you guys
leaving for your honeymoon?

15:43.938 --> 15:45.939
He says that every time he wakes up.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.641
Every time, same thing.

15:47.642 --> 15:51.611
Shouldn't he be alert by now?

15:51.612 --> 15:54.481
[Monitors beeping]

15:54.482 --> 15:56.616
Okay, he's having a seizure.
Go get some help.

15:56.617 --> 15:59.903
[Grunting]
Hey, hey, it's okay.

15:59.904 --> 16:02.205
Evan. Evan. Let go of him, okay?

16:02.206 --> 16:05.959
Just make sure he doesn't
fall off the bed.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.946
It's okay, Henry.
[Grunting]

16:16.585 --> 16:17.935
And if you could then

16:17.936 --> 16:19.687
- head to water mill...
- What about her hemoglobin?

16:19.688 --> 16:21.622
and squeeze in Mr. Binke's,
heartburn that would be great.

16:21.646 --> 16:23.980
- Oh, that's great, thanks.
- Thank you.

16:23.981 --> 16:26.600
Okay so Dr. Crowley's
on Mr. Dunn's angina,

16:26.601 --> 16:29.719
Dr. Tresna's draining Ms. Park's cysts.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.823
Yeah. That takes care
of all the Hankies.

16:32.824 --> 16:35.776
I'm sorry, did you say, "Hankies"?

16:35.777 --> 16:38.662
Uh, yes. Yes, that's what
we call all the associates.

16:38.663 --> 16:39.946
Ah.

16:39.947 --> 16:41.865
Well, that's what Evan calls them.

16:41.866 --> 16:44.751
Okay, I have been spending
way too much time with Evan.

16:44.752 --> 16:47.120
Thank God you're back.
[Chuckles]

16:47.121 --> 16:49.005
Good news... Erika's blood work is clean.

16:49.006 --> 16:51.124
- Well, that's a relief.
- Mm-hm.

16:51.125 --> 16:53.176
She and Tom are quite the pairing, huh?

16:53.177 --> 16:54.711
Well, they do seem very happy together.

16:54.712 --> 16:56.630
How about you? Despite
all the chaos around here,

16:56.631 --> 16:58.181
you seem to be in a good place.

16:58.182 --> 17:01.685
Um, I am. Finally.

17:01.686 --> 17:04.887
After last year
and my parents disowning me

17:04.888 --> 17:07.307
and falling for someone I barely knew,

17:07.308 --> 17:09.559
I want this summer to be all about work.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.144
Well, so far you're getting your wish.

17:11.145 --> 17:13.980
- I am, and I love it.
- I am so happy for y...

17:13.981 --> 17:15.932
[Laughs]

17:15.933 --> 17:18.285
Yeah, you know what?

17:18.286 --> 17:19.819
You've done more than enough...

17:19.820 --> 17:21.436
I'll meet you at the guest house.

17:21.438 --> 17:23.439
All right, bye-bye.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.660
- Okay.
- Later.

17:26.661 --> 17:30.080
- What was that about?
- What was what about?

17:30.081 --> 17:32.799
Your high tea with our new landlord.

17:32.800 --> 17:36.553
Dude, Dimitry's awesome.
He reminds me of Boris actually.

17:36.554 --> 17:41.141
- Just a lot less... anti-me.
- You know I don't trust him.

17:41.142 --> 17:42.926
What exactly is your issue with him?

17:42.927 --> 17:45.595
He gave us the run of the place,
he let us turn it into

17:45.596 --> 17:46.963
an urgent care center,

17:46.964 --> 17:48.631
and as executor of Boris's estate,

17:48.632 --> 17:49.900
he said that will never change.

17:49.901 --> 17:51.818
Executor?

17:56.807 --> 17:58.108
Dimitry...

17:58.109 --> 18:00.577
Uh, I'm sorry, Hank.
I'm behind schedule.

18:00.578 --> 18:04.147
Yeah. So who made you Boris's executor?

18:04.148 --> 18:06.449
Marisa.

18:06.450 --> 18:08.484
She asked me to help
sort out the estate.

18:08.485 --> 18:11.588
She did. I'm gonna give her a call.

18:11.589 --> 18:14.324
Please send her my regards, okay?

18:14.325 --> 18:16.426
Will do.

18:28.272 --> 18:30.273
Okay.

18:30.274 --> 18:33.977
Great. So am I gonna have to have my...

18:33.978 --> 18:36.363
Please step up on the scale,
and then you will do so next.

18:36.364 --> 18:37.814
[Mumbling]
She doesn't have to.

18:37.815 --> 18:39.649
She's not part
of the key person policy...

18:39.650 --> 18:43.186
Please don't open your mouth
until the thermometer beeps.

18:43.187 --> 18:45.021
Ooh, we should take
his temperature more often.

18:45.022 --> 18:47.290
He's saying I'm not part
of the key person policy.

18:47.291 --> 18:48.909
Only Hank, Evan, and Divya
are being insured.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.293
[Mumbling]
That's right.

18:50.294 --> 18:53.330
Oh, then you will need
to leave the exam area.

18:53.331 --> 18:54.581
Privacy regulations.

18:54.582 --> 18:56.583
Really? Awesome.

18:56.584 --> 18:58.385
I've got a few houses
to check out. See ya!

18:58.386 --> 19:01.338
[Mumbling] Wait a minute,
hold on a second, you can stay...

19:01.339 --> 19:03.173
I love you too.

19:03.174 --> 19:04.341
[Door closes]

19:04.342 --> 19:06.209
Now regarding your medical history...

19:06.210 --> 19:08.011
[Mumbling]
Okay, so Hank is by far...

19:08.012 --> 19:10.397
Hank is by far
the healthiest person I know.

19:10.398 --> 19:12.766
Now you'll have to start over.

19:12.767 --> 19:15.852
Now you underwent a craniotomy
in December of last year?

19:15.853 --> 19:17.187
I did.

19:17.188 --> 19:18.688
Are you still on the anti-seizure meds?

19:18.689 --> 19:20.156
Nope. And I'll be driving
again as soon as I'm cleared

19:20.157 --> 19:21.191
by a doctor.

19:21.192 --> 19:22.609
- And for pain?
- I'm off the narcotics

19:22.610 --> 19:24.778
and titrating down the tricyclics.

19:24.779 --> 19:26.246
[Mumbling]
Titrating down the tricyclics.

19:26.247 --> 19:28.832
[Beeping]
I'm done. Here you go.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.867
- Perfect.
- Thanks.

19:30.868 --> 19:34.237
- So are we approved?
- No idea.

19:34.238 --> 19:36.840
I'm just the nurse.

19:36.841 --> 19:39.626
Well, you have some pull, right?

19:44.081 --> 19:45.682
Yeah, so don't... don't worry about that.

19:45.683 --> 19:49.552
Her motor functions are fine.
She's just kind of awkward.

19:49.553 --> 19:50.753
Right? Tell him, Divs.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.923
So, uh...

20:00.948 --> 20:02.598
All right, Mr. Cho,
just keep it elevated,

20:02.599 --> 20:05.201
and I'll be there in about an hour.

20:05.202 --> 20:06.870
I know the symptoms.

20:06.871 --> 20:09.605
Give me a call
if the fever gets any worse.

20:09.606 --> 20:11.374
Okay. Thanks.

20:11.375 --> 20:14.777
Divya.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.496
Jeremiah?

20:16.497 --> 20:21.334
[Laughs]
Oh! I didn't recognize you.

20:21.335 --> 20:22.802
You look so...

20:22.803 --> 20:24.137
Different.

20:24.138 --> 20:26.789
- I have a beard now.
- [Laughs] So I see.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.425
Your nordic research
must have brought out

20:28.426 --> 20:29.559
a hidden side of you.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.928
It was pretty life-changing.

20:31.929 --> 20:34.764
What made you choose
research so far away?

20:34.765 --> 20:37.100
You left so fast,
I never even got a chance

20:37.101 --> 20:38.634
to speak to you about it.

20:38.635 --> 20:40.070
I had to get away for a bit.

20:40.071 --> 20:44.307
I made the decision on short notice.

20:44.308 --> 20:47.861
- I have a girlfriend.
- Good.

20:49.163 --> 20:51.364
- Well, welcome home.
- Good-bye, Divya.

20:52.783 --> 20:55.668
Nice to have you back, Jeremiah.

21:07.181 --> 21:09.215
[Sighs]

21:13.337 --> 21:15.638
Ugh.

21:17.508 --> 21:21.010
[Moaning]

21:26.734 --> 21:27.984
If Erika's blood results were fine,

21:27.985 --> 21:29.235
why are we here?

21:29.236 --> 21:30.686
Well, she could be getting
a low-grade pneumonia.

21:30.687 --> 21:32.522
I wouldn't be surprised
if the hours she's been keeping

21:32.523 --> 21:33.856
had lowered her immune system.

21:33.857 --> 21:34.857
Oh.

21:39.196 --> 21:41.081
Erika?

21:42.833 --> 21:44.384
Erika, are you down there?

21:44.385 --> 21:47.003
[Coughing]

21:47.004 --> 21:48.671
Erika! Erika!

21:48.672 --> 21:50.206
Hey, there's a fire! Are you okay?

21:50.207 --> 21:51.541
Yeah, I don't know what happened.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.259
Henry, just relax.
I got this, stay back.

21:53.260 --> 21:55.929
Oh, my God, what is he doing?

21:55.930 --> 21:58.231
Ev, what are you doing?

22:00.101 --> 22:03.103
[Coughing]
This is having very little effect.

22:08.159 --> 22:10.110
Let's get her out of here. Come on.

22:10.111 --> 22:11.895
- I think I got burned.
- Okay, okay, easy.

22:14.924 --> 22:16.925
[Inhales sharply]

22:19.869 --> 22:22.754
Ev, you sure you got it?

22:22.755 --> 22:26.091
Oh, yeah, just... you can't
exert yourself, Henry, just...

22:26.092 --> 22:27.292
I'm good, I got it.

22:27.293 --> 22:28.543
Okay.

22:28.544 --> 22:30.596
I know you're ruling out pneumonia,

22:30.597 --> 22:33.465
but I don't have any fever
or pleural pain.

22:33.466 --> 22:36.134
But I am exhausted.

22:36.135 --> 22:38.937
Which, as you know, is
another symptom of pneumonia.

22:38.938 --> 22:42.391
It's also a symptom
of being new at this.

22:42.392 --> 22:46.478
I'm used to sewing for fun,
not fund-raising.

22:46.479 --> 22:47.813
Erika, what happened down there

22:47.814 --> 22:49.931
could have been a lot worse.

22:49.932 --> 22:53.952
I just want my pieces to be flawless.

22:53.953 --> 22:56.738
For Tom.

22:56.739 --> 22:59.875
He wants this fund-raiser
to be better than ever,

22:59.876 --> 23:01.994
especially given
what's going on with the E.R..

23:01.995 --> 23:03.445
Of course.

23:03.446 --> 23:05.964
You know, he thinks I can pull this off,

23:05.965 --> 23:09.784
but I'm starting to think
that maybe I can't.

23:12.639 --> 23:15.590
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

23:23.799 --> 23:25.567
Ev, let me help you.

23:25.568 --> 23:27.653
Just sit down! Henry, relax!

23:27.654 --> 23:28.970
All right. All right.

23:28.971 --> 23:31.657
Here, so I don't screw up your X-ray.

23:31.658 --> 23:32.991
Here you go.

23:32.992 --> 23:35.277
I am not worried about the X-ray.

23:35.278 --> 23:36.862
Look, believe me, I'd help him,

23:36.863 --> 23:38.180
but he won't let me.

23:38.181 --> 23:41.816
Is it because you've had a craniotomy?

23:41.817 --> 23:45.987
- Uh...
- I saw the scar.

23:45.988 --> 23:48.507
Ah.

23:48.508 --> 23:50.959
Yeah, it was about six months ago.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.544
And you're back to work full time?

23:52.545 --> 23:54.262
Today is my first day.

23:54.263 --> 23:56.598
[Laughs]
Well, I hope you're not overdoing it.

23:56.599 --> 23:58.967
Why don't we both knock off
a little early today?

23:58.968 --> 24:02.688
I need to replace the piece
that got burned

24:02.689 --> 24:04.856
and fix a few hems

24:04.857 --> 24:06.841
and then cross my fingers and pray.

24:06.842 --> 24:08.310
And then you've got a deal.

24:08.311 --> 24:10.362
Only if you promise
to check in with me by 4:00.

24:10.363 --> 24:11.730
Done.

24:26.862 --> 24:29.164
It's perfect, right?

24:29.165 --> 24:32.134
- Yeah, it's great.
- It is great.

24:32.135 --> 24:35.337
We're steps from the beach,
all new appliances.

24:35.338 --> 24:36.838
[Beep]
[Air conditioner whirring]

24:36.839 --> 24:38.557
There's a separate office
just for you, and...

24:38.558 --> 24:40.425
[Air conditioner whirring]

24:40.426 --> 24:42.010
What?

24:42.011 --> 24:44.712
What do you mean, "what"?
The air conditioner's so loud.

24:44.713 --> 24:46.264
The air conditioner is loud.

24:46.265 --> 24:49.518
Oh, my God, it smells
like wet dog sweater.

24:49.519 --> 24:51.520
This whole room
now smells like wet dog sweater.

24:51.521 --> 24:53.772
It's disgusting.

24:53.773 --> 24:55.890
Wet dog sweater.

24:55.891 --> 24:57.909
[Sighs]

24:57.910 --> 25:01.113
[Birds calling]

25:01.114 --> 25:03.698
Why don't you want to live with me?

25:05.334 --> 25:08.036
What? Of course I want to live with you.

25:08.037 --> 25:11.173
If you did, you would
have found us a place

25:11.174 --> 25:12.591
instead of complaining

25:12.592 --> 25:15.343
about some stupid air conditioner.

25:15.344 --> 25:18.046
It's not stupid.
It's just I have to hear

25:18.047 --> 25:19.514
our patients when they call.

25:19.515 --> 25:21.216
Or Hank. What if Hank's
in trouble or something

25:21.217 --> 25:22.684
and he's trying to call
and I don't hear the phone,

25:22.685 --> 25:24.603
so I can't answer it
because of the stupid thing?

25:24.604 --> 25:28.890
Oh, my God. This isn't about us.

25:28.891 --> 25:31.393
- It's about Hank.
- What?

25:31.394 --> 25:33.261
You're worried about
being separated from Hank

25:33.262 --> 25:38.567
while he's recovering.
It makes perfect sense.

25:38.568 --> 25:40.869
You're saying that I've become
a Hankwatch addict?

25:40.870 --> 25:43.705
Yeah.

25:43.706 --> 25:45.940
[Sighs]

25:45.941 --> 25:50.295
Paige, I am so unbelievably psyched

25:50.296 --> 25:51.779
to start our new life together,

25:51.780 --> 25:55.950
but I can't until I'm sure Hank's okay.

25:55.951 --> 25:58.753
I just can't leave him yet.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.235
Udo.

26:13.236 --> 26:15.470
Dr. Lawson, how can I help you?

26:15.471 --> 26:17.805
Why is Dimitry spending
so much time here?

26:17.806 --> 26:19.658
I am sorry, I'm not
at liberty to discuss

26:19.659 --> 26:22.077
the affairs of my employer.

26:22.078 --> 26:25.530
Your employer?
Boris is the one who hired you.

26:25.531 --> 26:30.151
Dr. Lawson, I work for Mr. Vasilyev now.

26:30.152 --> 26:31.620
[Clicks tongue]

26:36.843 --> 26:40.462
[Breathing deeply]
Soft.

26:40.463 --> 26:41.680
What are you doing?

26:41.681 --> 26:43.598
Just harnessing the pre-retainer client

26:43.599 --> 26:45.550
adrenaline burst, Henry.

26:45.551 --> 26:48.336
[Breathing deeply]

26:48.337 --> 26:50.555
Pace yourself, Daniel-San,
I don't think she's home.

26:50.556 --> 26:53.358
Dr. Lawson! Mr. Lawson!

26:53.359 --> 26:55.527
Ms. Ballard!
We thought this was your house!

26:55.528 --> 26:57.729
No, she obviously owns both houses.

26:57.730 --> 27:00.682
Both your houses
are just lovely, Ms. Ballard.

27:00.683 --> 27:02.234
No, no. I live here.

27:02.235 --> 27:03.902
I was cutting Mr. Mcalary's
hedges this morning

27:03.903 --> 27:05.186
so they'd be up to code.

27:05.187 --> 27:06.621
Oh, okay.

27:06.622 --> 27:08.657
Well, your house is far lovelier.

27:08.658 --> 27:10.575
Uh, Ms. Ballard,
can we just stop for a second

27:10.576 --> 27:12.160
so I can examine your arm?

27:12.161 --> 27:13.962
A power walk with pit stops? Sorry.

27:13.963 --> 27:15.363
You call this walking?

27:15.364 --> 27:17.749
Range of motion testing
is standard of care,

27:17.750 --> 27:20.535
and as your hedge trimming
proclivities attest,

27:20.536 --> 27:21.720
surely you're a woman

27:21.721 --> 27:23.638
who understands that rules are rules.

27:23.639 --> 27:25.223
Indeed I am, and the Hankmed
standard of care

27:25.224 --> 27:27.142
seems to be quite all-encompassing.

27:27.143 --> 27:29.377
That is correct,
and our retainer clients

27:29.378 --> 27:31.646
also enjoy whatever
vip services they need.

27:31.647 --> 27:34.549
By the way, is shadow pond
zoned for a CT scanner?

27:34.550 --> 27:35.817
- Oh...
- And heaven knows

27:35.818 --> 27:37.819
where you dump all your medical waste.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.437
What? I assure you, we don't dump...

27:39.438 --> 27:40.906
well, whatever you do with it,
this neighborhood is too rich

27:40.907 --> 27:42.240
in beauty and history

27:42.241 --> 27:45.243
to harbor a ring of illicit
biomedical activities.

27:45.244 --> 27:47.078
- What?
- The splint feels great though.

27:47.079 --> 27:50.115
- Thank you.
- Oh, I'm so glad.

27:57.540 --> 28:00.342
Did that woman seriously
just try to brockovich us?

28:00.343 --> 28:02.577
Are we being brockoviched right now?

28:02.578 --> 28:04.713
That's not a verb,
and we'll be fine. Hi.

28:04.714 --> 28:07.415
I mean, if you don't want
to sign a retainer, great,

28:07.416 --> 28:08.800
have a good life.

28:08.801 --> 28:12.270
But don't sit there
and accuse us of chernobyling

28:12.271 --> 28:13.605
the whole freakin' neighborhood.

28:13.606 --> 28:15.089
- Also not a verb.
- Whoa, whoa.

28:15.090 --> 28:16.558
What are you doing there?
I'm moving a chair.

28:16.559 --> 28:18.977
- Okay, let me help you.
- No, I can move a chair, Evan.

28:18.978 --> 28:20.445
- Henry, let me...
- The doctor said to relax.

28:20.446 --> 28:23.765
- Oh, fine. You move it.
- Thank you.

28:23.766 --> 28:25.317
Gosh.

28:28.204 --> 28:29.871
Where were you going with it?

28:29.872 --> 28:31.323
It doesn't matter.

28:31.324 --> 28:33.274
'Cause once you move out,
I'm gonna put it where I want it

28:33.275 --> 28:36.244
and you won't be here to stop me.

28:36.245 --> 28:38.046
What?
[Sighs]

28:38.047 --> 28:40.498
You're not moving out.

28:40.499 --> 28:43.134
What about the great place you found?

28:43.135 --> 28:45.053
The air conditioner was loud,

28:45.054 --> 28:48.139
and it smelled like wet dog sweater.

28:48.140 --> 28:49.457
Wet dog sweater.

28:49.458 --> 28:51.476
Four physicals, three broken bones,

28:51.477 --> 28:54.763
two heart attacks,
one that turned out to be gas,

28:54.764 --> 28:56.848
and a Hankmed intern
stranded on the side of the road

28:56.849 --> 28:58.933
with no gas.

28:58.934 --> 29:01.135
I'm exhausted, and I am hungry.

29:01.136 --> 29:02.520
Because you never take
time out for energy boosts.

29:02.521 --> 29:04.305
If he offers you hemp juice, say no.

29:04.306 --> 29:05.740
[Chuckles]

29:05.741 --> 29:08.193
Hey, could you cover for me
tomorrow night?

29:08.194 --> 29:10.144
[Whispers]
Yeah.

29:10.145 --> 29:11.746
I'm sorry,

29:11.747 --> 29:13.815
why would Evan cover for you?

29:13.816 --> 29:15.367
I cover for you.

29:15.368 --> 29:19.754
Unless when you say, "cover,"
what you really mean is Hanksit.

29:21.757 --> 29:23.792
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles] Hanksit.

29:23.793 --> 29:27.178
[Chuckles]
It's Hankwatch.

29:27.179 --> 29:28.963
Hanksit sounds ridiculous. We tried it.

29:28.964 --> 29:31.049
Wait, is that why you guys
aren't moving out?

29:31.050 --> 29:33.718
- Well...
- Okay, people.

29:33.719 --> 29:36.721
I don't need to be hanksat
or hankwatched.

29:36.722 --> 29:38.023
I am back to work.

29:38.024 --> 29:39.858
I don't feel sick. I am fine.

29:39.859 --> 29:42.060
You don't need to live with me
or hover over me.

29:42.061 --> 29:43.678
And now that I'm back up to full speed

29:43.679 --> 29:46.180
there are too many hanklets
or hankettes,

29:46.181 --> 29:47.532
or whatever you call these people,

29:47.533 --> 29:48.900
in the kitchen.

29:48.901 --> 29:50.869
I'm sorry, Dr. Papa,
you can go to your appointments

29:50.870 --> 29:52.287
or whatever they have you doing.

29:52.288 --> 29:54.622
Doctors, thank you all so much
for all your help.

29:54.623 --> 29:56.241
- Really appreciate it.
- Great.

29:56.242 --> 29:58.460
It's just too chaotic around here.

29:58.461 --> 30:00.378
I can't even keep track
of a simple thing

30:00.379 --> 30:04.699
like who was taking the
follow-up call from Erika?

30:04.700 --> 30:07.535
So who took the follow-up call
from Erika?

30:07.536 --> 30:08.803
She was supposed to check in by 4:00.

30:08.804 --> 30:10.922
It's already after 5:00. Anyone?

30:16.211 --> 30:17.879
Okay, she's not picking up.

30:22.017 --> 30:24.218
Excuse me, have any of you seen Erika?

30:24.219 --> 30:26.488
- No, I haven't.
- Sorry.

30:26.489 --> 30:31.159
Um, okay, Henry?

30:31.160 --> 30:32.327
Henry.

30:34.163 --> 30:37.916
[Wheezing]
Erika!

30:37.917 --> 30:40.535
Erika.

30:40.536 --> 30:43.922
What's wrong with her?
[Wheezing]

30:43.923 --> 30:47.208
She's in respiratory distress.
She's barely getting any air.

30:47.209 --> 30:48.426
- Bag her.
- Mm-hm.

30:48.427 --> 30:50.628
I'll cut the nebulizer.

30:50.629 --> 30:52.347
Erika, breathe with this.

30:54.917 --> 30:59.721
Breathe, Erika, that's it.

30:59.722 --> 31:01.022
[Machine whirring]
Didn't you say

31:01.023 --> 31:02.607
she needed oxygen? What is that stuff?

31:02.608 --> 31:04.476
The albuterol will relax
the muscles in her airway

31:04.477 --> 31:06.444
so oxygen can get in.

31:06.445 --> 31:09.981
Erika, take slow, deep breaths.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.868
That's it.

31:16.455 --> 31:18.439
[Coughing]

31:21.961 --> 31:24.712
Hey, what happened?

31:24.713 --> 31:27.582
I thought you were taking it easy.

31:27.583 --> 31:31.669
Erika, does your necklace always
have these green flecks on it?

31:37.292 --> 31:38.960
We gotta get her out of here now.

31:41.836 --> 31:44.314
- What kind of poisoning?
- Hydrogen sulfide.

31:44.315 --> 31:45.966
The symptoms line up.

31:45.967 --> 31:48.652
Yeah, but from what?
And don't say hydrogen sulfide.

31:48.653 --> 31:49.853
[Laughs]

31:49.854 --> 31:51.355
My guess is it's from
a leak in the pipes

31:51.356 --> 31:53.190
running into your house.

31:53.191 --> 31:55.609
Acute poisoning can occur
from even a few hours

31:55.610 --> 31:58.579
of prolonged exposure
in a small, enclosed space.

31:58.580 --> 32:00.914
See, the gas turns copper green.

32:00.915 --> 32:03.316
As it built up in your system
you got sicker and sicker.

32:03.317 --> 32:05.869
But you're gonna be okay.
I'll alert health services.

32:05.870 --> 32:07.838
Good.

32:07.839 --> 32:11.208
I am so sorry.
You should be home resting.

32:11.209 --> 32:13.493
I like taking care of people.
And I don't...

32:13.494 --> 32:16.830
Need rest. Right, I get it.

32:16.831 --> 32:20.467
Look, sometimes people overdo it
and make things worse.

32:20.468 --> 32:23.186
Not that you would do that,
being a doctor and all.

32:23.187 --> 32:24.638
[Chuckles]

32:24.639 --> 32:28.008
Okay, so this sodium nitrite
should reverse the ill effects.

32:28.009 --> 32:29.643
But unfortunately,

32:29.644 --> 32:30.844
you'll have to evacuate your home

32:30.845 --> 32:33.647
until the leak is fixed.

32:33.648 --> 32:36.033
You're saying I have
to cancel the fund-raiser.

32:38.870 --> 32:41.455
Maybe not.

33:22.497 --> 33:25.115
[Both laugh]

33:25.116 --> 33:27.617
You are a rock star.
I am so proud of you.

33:27.618 --> 33:29.286
- Thank you.
- I love you.

33:29.287 --> 33:30.921
Well, it seems like your patient pajamas

33:30.922 --> 33:32.339
are quite the success.

33:32.340 --> 33:34.174
Not only that, but a friend of mine

33:34.175 --> 33:37.127
just told me that he wants
to talk to you about a future

33:37.128 --> 33:38.128
in designing.

33:38.129 --> 33:40.413
That's amazing news, Erika.

33:40.414 --> 33:42.599
Yeah, a dream come true.

33:42.600 --> 33:46.770
It... it is amazing.

33:46.771 --> 33:49.639
Which is why it's so hard
for me to say no.

33:49.640 --> 33:53.060
Honey, I wanted all of this
to be perfect for you

33:53.061 --> 33:55.946
and in doing so, my hobby became work

33:55.947 --> 33:59.149
and it stopped being fun.

33:59.150 --> 34:02.402
Which is why I want
to go back to nursing.

34:02.403 --> 34:06.289
It's who I am. It makes me happy.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.742
After all, it's what helped me find you.

34:08.743 --> 34:10.460
That's true.

34:13.781 --> 34:15.114
Thank you.

34:15.116 --> 34:17.717
I do happen to know
people at Hamptons Heritage.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.636
Well, it's now...

34:19.637 --> 34:21.505
[chuckles] It's now officially called

34:21.505 --> 34:24.174
"Hamptons Heritage,
a symphony hospital."

34:24.175 --> 34:26.893
The approval went through
just an hour ago.

34:26.893 --> 34:29.179
Symphony will be taking over
the hospital within days.

34:29.179 --> 34:31.648
And the E.R. should be up
and running in short order.

34:31.649 --> 34:34.484
- Now, that's amazing news.
- Please excuse us.

34:34.485 --> 34:35.936
- No, congratulations.
- I'm sorry, we'll be back.

34:35.937 --> 34:36.969
Thanks so much, Divya.

- Hi.

35:04.665 --> 35:05.932
We're gonna castle-sit.

35:05.933 --> 35:07.467
I asked Dimitry. He said the big house

35:07.468 --> 35:08.969
is gonna stay empty.

35:08.970 --> 35:10.336
It's the perfect compromise.

35:10.337 --> 35:12.139
We'll be close to Hank
and alone with each other

35:12.140 --> 35:15.225
and our 16 bathrooms.

35:15.226 --> 35:16.810
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

35:16.811 --> 35:19.529
Well, it could be 14,
'cause I don't really...

35:19.530 --> 35:22.348
whatever it is, we'll be together.

35:22.349 --> 35:24.734

Hey, Robinson Crusoe!

Hey.

- So you kept the beard, huh?
- Yes.

35:44.889 --> 35:47.707
Well, facial hair
is not exactly Hankmed policy.

35:50.394 --> 35:52.813
But I'll think about
making a one-time exception.

35:52.814 --> 35:56.900
If you'd clean it up
just a little, 'cause...

35:56.901 --> 35:59.552
unless you're trying
to hide from somebody, um...

How about your girlfriend?

36:09.363 --> 36:10.997
What does she think of your beard?

36:10.998 --> 36:14.668
- I haven't mentioned it to her.
- She hasn't seen it?

36:14.669 --> 36:16.336
We converse online.

36:20.508 --> 36:24.044
She hasn't asked you for money, has she?

since my surgery.

I'm ready to start getting off the meds.

37:38.652 --> 37:40.320
Why don't we skip this dose?

37:40.321 --> 37:43.006
Because you know
that responsible pain management

37:43.007 --> 37:47.294
means avoiding breakthrough pain
caused by end-of-dose failure.

37:47.295 --> 37:49.212
Which is precisely what
you'd tell one of your patients.

- obviously I can't afford that.
- I see.

38:48.689 --> 38:50.824
The problem is I just finished
my first full day back,

38:50.825 --> 38:52.859
and I'm still experiencing some pain.

38:52.860 --> 38:55.328
So I thought I should add back
a little hydrocodone,

38:55.329 --> 38:56.746
just until it subsides.

38:56.747 --> 38:58.231
And you'd like me to prescribe it.

38:58.232 --> 39:01.418
Yes. I would.

this off, but I am impressed.

all the credit, but I can't.

the guy a chance, Henry.

and tell them...

I don't really think
that that's necessary.

that previous surgeries

41:49.074 --> 41:51.192
cannot be used to deny coverage
and if the guy...
