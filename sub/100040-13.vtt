WEBVTT

00:12.595 --> 00:15.807
Attempt number 803 of my new project.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.726
This is the one. I can feel it.

00:17.809 --> 00:18.935
I'm ready.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.022
And here we go.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.737
<i>♪ Riding on a groovy wave of love ♪</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:32.449
<i>♪ I'm going for a cosmic ride ♪</i>

00:32.532 --> 00:36.619
<i>♪ Surf the freaky purple vibes of love ♪</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:41.541
<i>♪ The marshmallow cat is inside ♪</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:44.294
"Marshmallow cat is inside"?

00:44.377 --> 00:47.130
That's what I wrote? That's meaningless.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.758
-Janet.
-Hi, there. How's the songwriting going?

00:49.841 --> 00:53.803
I'm completely lost here
and I can't do the stupid E chord.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.473
Would you like a magic guitar
that plays all the notes for you?

00:56.556 --> 00:59.893
It's the number one request among men
over 50 who have gotten in here.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.437
No, the whole point
is to learn how to do stuff

01:02.520 --> 01:04.189
without using afterlife magic.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.817
Maybe keep it on deck.
I don't know. Whatever.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.153
We should go, by the way.
We're gonna be late.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.572
Oh, where does the time go?

01:13.948 --> 01:17.327
<i>♪ Surf the freaky purple vibes... ♪</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:19.204
-So, ultimately,

01:19.287 --> 01:22.457
this all goes back to the line
from Professor May's book,

01:22.540 --> 01:27.212
"Mortality offers meaning to our lives
and morality helps navigate that meaning."

01:27.295 --> 01:29.047
Wait, what I think it says is that,

01:29.130 --> 01:32.342
"Mortality offers meaning
to the events of our lives."

01:32.425 --> 01:34.886
Uh, check yourself, rando.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.387
I think Chidi Anagonye,

01:36.471 --> 01:38.932
who literally designed the afterlife,
knows what he's talking about.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.851
Look, I'm pretty sure I'm right
since it's my book.

01:41.935 --> 01:46.105
Uh, yes, Professor May, you're probably
right about what you wrote.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.149
Still think
he should check himself.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.568
Okay, everyone.
We'll see you all here next week.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.196
Professor Hieronymi will be teaching
the trolley problem.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.907
Bring ponchos. It gets messy.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.117
You ready, Chidi?

02:02.956 --> 02:05.458
Hello, Jeff. See the collection's grown.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.461
Yeah, sure has.
I have 322 frog things now.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.672
Three twenty-three.
I just got another one!

02:11.923 --> 02:14.634
Never not excited about frogs, that guy.

02:14.717 --> 02:15.927
He knows what he likes.

02:17.470 --> 02:21.474
This meeting of the Joint Council
of Afterlife Affairs is called to order.

02:21.558 --> 02:25.520
Let's make this quick, kids.
I just started rewatching <i>The Leftovers.</i>

02:25.603 --> 02:28.940
Honestly, when I found out
that Carrie Coon was never nominated,

02:29.023 --> 02:31.651
I almost erased 2% of humanity.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.528
Michael, update.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.863
Things are going fairly well.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.574
A new crop of humans just passed
their tests.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.952
Among the notables who got in,
Roberto Clemente,

02:41.035 --> 02:43.454
Zora Neale Hurston,
Saint Thomas Aquinas...

02:43.538 --> 02:45.957
-Yes!
-...eighth-century Sufi mystic poet

02:46.040 --> 02:49.711
Hazrat Bibi Rabia Basri and Clara Peller.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.088
She was the "Where's the Beef?" lady.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.132
-Oh.
-"Where's the Beef?" lady got in.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.884
So, that's fun.

02:55.967 --> 03:00.263
Honestly, our biggest problem is
that we need more architects and actors.

03:00.346 --> 03:04.517
Well, sorry, but these younger demon
actors have no dedication to their craft.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.769
They think they can just start acting.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.981
They have to learn
that acting is reacting.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.567
And reacting is pre-acting.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.987
But pre-acting? Well, that's just being.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.865
Okay, take it down a notch,
Daniel Day-Lewis.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.033
Shawn? What ya got?

03:20.116 --> 03:22.869
Well, I'll begin by saying
that this new system stinks,

03:22.952 --> 03:24.120
and Michael stinks,

03:24.203 --> 03:25.997
and we should throw
this all in the garbage

03:26.080 --> 03:28.166
and go back to the way it used to be
when everyone was tortured.

03:28.249 --> 03:32.712
There's still some bumps in the road,
but this system is good and it's working.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.631
Come on, admit it.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.550
I will never... ever, ever, ever, ever...

03:37.634 --> 03:43.806
ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever...

03:43.890 --> 03:46.559
ever, ever, ever, ever...

03:47.185 --> 03:49.771
ever admit that.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.065
I know, buddy. I know.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.414
-What time is it?
-I don't know.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.166
Really?

04:10.833 --> 04:11.751
Yeah.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.254
At one point, hundreds of Bearimys ago,

04:14.337 --> 04:16.256
I turned off my ability to know
what time it is

04:16.339 --> 04:18.508
anywhere in the universe
when you and I are together.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.843
I like not knowing.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.389
It's 10:42 a.m.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.267
Sorry, saying out loud that I didn't know
something made me feel weird.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.812
Man, I feel weird
when I do know something.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.814
You and I are very different.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.401
Okay, gotta go meet my dad.
I'm gonna try one more time.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.528
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.406
Ugh, I'm freaking out, man.

04:41.489 --> 04:44.742
You got this, dawg.
One more play for all the marbles.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.953
I love you and I believe in you.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.622
Thanks, Dad.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.375
-Okay, here we go.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.962
<i>Bortles gonna throw... yes!</i>

04:58.131 --> 04:59.799
- I did it!
- You did it!

04:59.882 --> 05:02.427
It took you more than 433,000 tries,

05:02.510 --> 05:05.680
but you just played
the perfect game of Madden!

05:05.763 --> 05:06.764
You did it!

05:08.391 --> 05:10.685
That's my boy.
That's my boy.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.479
I did it.

05:18.985 --> 05:19.944
Okay.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.030
-Janet?
-Hi, there.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.865
Hi, Janet. I made dinner.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.701
You always make it for me,
so this time I wanted to make it.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.953
And real talk, it didn't go great.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.413
This is spaghetti.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.373
Now, I know it looks weird,

05:32.457 --> 05:36.252
but I bit off a chunk, and actually,
it's pretty bad.

05:36.961 --> 05:40.715
Also, I put out the forks and knives
the way kings and queens do it.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.633
Close to the plates.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.177
-Also--
-Uh-oh.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.680
Oh, dip.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.433
Yeah.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.018
So...

05:53.561 --> 05:55.646
I need to talk to everyone.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.441
Should I ask them to come here?

05:58.524 --> 05:59.817
No, I...

06:00.735 --> 06:02.195
I had a better idea.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.741
-Hello, you two.
-Hi.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.743
What fun meeting back here!

06:08.826 --> 06:12.497
Wow! You even restored it
to the way it used to look.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.374
What inspired this, J-Dawg?
You get a hankering for frozen yogurt?

06:15.458 --> 06:16.292
No.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.211
I have an announcement to make.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.255
I'm leaving.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.632
Going through the door.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.175
Wow.

06:25.009 --> 06:25.843
Are you sure?

06:26.719 --> 06:28.387
Yeah, I am.

06:29.097 --> 06:29.931
It's time.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.349
We thought the best move was

06:31.432 --> 06:33.851
to gather everyone together
for a sort of farewell party.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.687
We're gonna eat and drink,
and there will be dancing...

06:37.271 --> 06:38.106
Fun.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.690
Whee!

06:39.774 --> 06:41.943
Okay, homies, you're sad.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.822
I can tell 'cause you have the same looks
on your faces that my teachers did

06:45.905 --> 06:47.532
whenever I raised my hand in class.

06:47.615 --> 06:50.034
But let's be happy. I'm gonna DJ.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.161
We'll play EDM all night. Come on.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.163
-Come on.
- Ah!

06:54.247 --> 06:55.081
Oof!

06:55.164 --> 06:57.041
Now, I'm bummed about two things.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.259
Hey there, Doug.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.552
-Hi.
-Having fun?

07:07.635 --> 07:09.137
I've had so much chicken.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.389
It's probably good
you chose your young body.

07:11.472 --> 07:12.431
Yeah.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.103
How are you doing?

07:19.021 --> 07:20.189
I'm okay, Michael.

07:20.857 --> 07:21.691
How are you?

07:21.774 --> 07:22.608
Well...

07:23.609 --> 07:24.694
I'm sad.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.489
And I know you're the most advanced being
in the universe,

07:28.573 --> 07:32.743
but I feel like I need to tell you
it's okay if you're sad, too.

07:32.827 --> 07:33.953
I know.

07:34.495 --> 07:39.542
And I am a little, but also, I know
this is the right time for him to leave.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.794
I really am okay. I promise.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.463
Will you come talk to me if you're not?

07:44.213 --> 07:45.089
Always.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.050
-How y'all doin' tonight?

07:49.051 --> 07:51.095
Okay, homies, we got a real special treat.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.681
My old dance crew,
Dance Dance Resolution, is here!

07:53.764 --> 07:56.058
-Y'all ready to tear it up one last time?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.938
What? Yes!

08:47.443 --> 08:49.487
That was special.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.656
I'll never forget this night...

08:52.240 --> 08:55.159
until I walk through the door
and dissolve into the universe.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.494
Can I ask you something, buddy?

08:57.578 --> 09:00.414
How did you... know?

09:01.040 --> 09:04.919
Look, it wasn't like I heard a bell ring
or anything.

09:05.002 --> 09:09.131
I just suddenly had this calm feeling,

09:09.215 --> 09:15.137
like the air inside my lungs was the
same as the air outside my body.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.806
It was peaceful.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.269
You know the feeling when you think
a jalapeño popper is gonna be too hot,

09:21.352 --> 09:25.022
but you bite into it anyway
and it's actually the perfect temperature?

09:25.106 --> 09:28.776
Believe it or not, I do know that feeling.
That feeling rules.

09:28.859 --> 09:29.902
There you go.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.404
Uh...

09:31.904 --> 09:33.614
Can I get your advice on something?

09:34.991 --> 09:37.368
I'm scared Janet's gonna forget me.

09:37.451 --> 09:40.913
Her falling in love with someone else,
I'm fine with that.

09:40.997 --> 09:45.126
If Jason Momoa
or if Lara Croft, Tomb Raider gets in,

09:45.209 --> 09:47.628
and Janet's like, "That's what's up!"

09:47.712 --> 09:48.671
Totally cool.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.841
But her forgetting me would be sad.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.759
So, I made her this.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.013
What do you guys think?

09:57.096 --> 09:58.598
It's lovely.

09:59.849 --> 10:04.437
But she's not gonna forget you, man.
I mean, she literally can't.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.063
She remembers everything
that ever happened.

10:06.856 --> 10:11.402
Even if she could forget someone,
I don't think she's gonna forget you.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.071
Thanks.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.741
When I had Jason,
I was 18 years old.

10:16.824 --> 10:20.536
In many ways, Jason raised me
just as much as I raised him.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.956
So, thanks for being a great dad, son!

10:24.040 --> 10:25.374
-I love you, Dad!

10:26.626 --> 10:28.210
Jason is the realest dude ever.

10:28.836 --> 10:31.922
I mean, none of us are real anymore.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.467
We're all just Caspers the Ghosts
and whatnot.

10:34.550 --> 10:37.011
Which is funny, because me and Jason
ain't even white.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.929
Why are all ghosts white?

10:39.764 --> 10:42.308
Oh, dip, are ghosts racist?

10:42.391 --> 10:45.269
What I'm trying to say is,
"I love you, dawg.

10:46.103 --> 10:46.937
You're my hero.

10:47.980 --> 10:48.856
You're my best friend.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.233
And you're my guard to Minshew."

11:24.850 --> 11:27.144
You can sit on that bench
as long as you want.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.438
Whenever you're ready,
you just walk through.

11:35.861 --> 11:36.779
I love you, Janet.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.739
I love you, too, Jason.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.411
I hope you have a nice rest of eternity.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.495
Mmm.

11:44.578 --> 11:45.621
I made you something.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.667
Oh, dip, I lost it.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.710
-It's okay.
-No, it's not.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.963
I made you this cool thing
so you'll remember me

11:54.046 --> 11:55.506
even when you're married to Aquaman.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.884
And I lost it somewhere in this forest.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.554
-Some magical squirrel probably ate it.
-Jason, it's okay.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.014
I'm never gonna forget you.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.059
In fact, to me,
you won't even really be gone.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.271
I don't experience time
the same way you do.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.024
I kind of live all times at once.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.652
I know what you mean.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.990
Once, I smoked salvia and saw the past
and the future at the same time.

12:21.073 --> 12:21.949
Hmm.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.702
Then I tried to brush my teeth
with my cat.

12:25.953 --> 12:31.083
To me, remembering moments with you
is the same as living in them.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.755
Could you just remember the happy times
and forget the bad stuff?

12:37.798 --> 12:39.383
There was no bad stuff.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.052
It was all good.

13:07.786 --> 13:08.621
Oh.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.332
These spindles are gorgeous.

13:11.415 --> 13:15.127
And there's almost a feeling
of musculature to this transition.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.923
The oak just sort of told me the shape
before I even got to the spokeshave.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.674
This under-bevel is a great trick.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.094
It really makes it feel lighter,
while leaving you plenty of beef to carve.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.680
It's really just a modified Danish line.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.015
Still, you made it your own.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.309
This is as good a chair as I've seen.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.977
I have nothing left to teach you.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.354
Ah! Hurrah!

13:34.188 --> 13:35.356
Thank you.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.151
-Janet.
-Hi, there.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.528
Call up the list, please.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.821
Congratulations.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.407
Actually, I just finished
repaving my driveway yesterday.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.034
So, cross that one off, too.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.787
Before you start your next project,

13:49.870 --> 13:52.957
you should know, that thing that you asked
me to tell you when it happened?

13:53.499 --> 13:54.583
It happened.

13:56.669 --> 14:01.173
I mean, they've gone through the system
so they'll be a little different, right?

14:01.257 --> 14:02.841
One would hope.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.927
I've never had lunch with Mum and Dad.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.346
I've only stood
silently behind their chairs

14:07.429 --> 14:09.557
while they ate lobster tail
with Oscar de la Renta.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.058
I'm right here.

14:11.850 --> 14:12.977
We will get through this together.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.980
Here we go.

14:18.524 --> 14:22.194
-Mother, Father, welcome to--
-My darlings!

14:22.278 --> 14:23.612
My darlings.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.698
My little girls!

14:25.781 --> 14:28.701
We love you both so much!

14:28.784 --> 14:30.744
So very much!

14:30.828 --> 14:33.330
We have a million things
to talk to you about.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.041
But first, we are sorry.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.253
We'll just be endlessly sorry,
forever and ever.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.426
-Holy crap.
-I know, right?

15:03.819 --> 15:04.945
Ugh!

15:05.029 --> 15:08.616
For the one millionth time
they've sent us teddy bears and flowers.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.702
You think they'd understand we can get
these things ourselves if we want.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.373
-Ah, that's lovely.
-Thanks.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.251
You know, I never thought
I would say this,

15:19.335 --> 15:20.836
but I'm getting a little bored

15:20.920 --> 15:23.339
of Mom and Dad telling us
how much they love us.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.799
Yes.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.928
Isn't that something?

15:33.390 --> 15:36.769
Well, this may not come as a surprise
to any of you, but...

15:38.646 --> 15:39.772
I'm ready to go.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.149
Oh, nuts. I knew it.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.068
-You finished everything on your list?
- I did.

15:44.735 --> 15:48.113
I learned how to install a bathtub,
fly a helicopter, defuse a bomb,

15:48.781 --> 15:50.658
deliver the perfect backhand slice.

15:50.741 --> 15:54.453
My last goal was to spend
one meaningful day with my parents,

15:54.536 --> 15:56.664
and now I've spent thousands of them.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.582
I feel complete.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.793
Would you like me
to prepare a farewell party for you?

16:00.876 --> 16:03.045
No need. I've done it myself.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.089
I've cooked all the food,
mixed all the drinks,

16:05.172 --> 16:07.883
made all the furniture,
repainted all the walls,

16:07.967 --> 16:09.426
and trained all the animals.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.469
Champagne?

16:10.552 --> 16:11.553
Uh, sure.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.763
Thank you, panda.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.307
Also, I've already said goodbye
to everyone else in my life.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.976
My sister, my parents...

16:17.059 --> 16:19.520
Bey and Jay, who took it very hard.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.856
Tonight, it's just us.

16:31.115 --> 16:35.869
I hate to tell you this,
but your risotto was a little sticky.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.372
-Was it?
-No, damn it, it was amazing.

16:38.455 --> 16:42.626
Just trying to figure out a way to get you
to hang around for a few more Bearimys.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.712
Can I tell you something?

16:45.796 --> 16:47.006
You're my role model.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.841
Come on.

16:48.924 --> 16:49.925
I'm serious.

16:50.009 --> 16:54.513
Babe, you were already
the most impressive person I ever met,

16:54.596 --> 16:56.557
and now you can do literally everything.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.893
If that's true,
it's because you inspired me.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.896
I admire you so very much.

17:02.980 --> 17:06.942
Your strength, your toughness,
your self-esteem, not to mention...

17:07.693 --> 17:09.611
you have a rockin' bod.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.822
Did you just turn the tables on me?

17:13.782 --> 17:15.451
I got nothin' left to teach you.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.120
-Janet.
-Hi, there.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.080
One more goal to add to the list, please.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.082
Now, cross it off.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.172
I know we already said goodbye.
I'm not even here.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.381
I just had to see you one last time

17:29.465 --> 17:31.508
because I hooked up
with Alexander the Great.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.927
- Oh.
-And it was more like Alexander the Fine.

17:34.011 --> 17:34.845
-Okay.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.638
Anyway, I love you, I love you,
goodbye forever.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.639
-Bye, love!
- Bye.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.976
I admire your breadth of knowledge.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.353
I can only do one thing, be an architect.

17:43.437 --> 17:47.691
I've spent the last 500 Bearimys
trying to learn how to play the guitar.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.486
And I just mastered "Hey There Delilah."

17:50.569 --> 17:52.738
Don't sell yourself short, Michael.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.283
I dare say you're the greatest architect
in existence.

17:56.366 --> 18:00.120
-And I should know--
-Frank Gehry is my godfather.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.040
Fair enough. I deserved that.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.502
Oh, Tahani,
I'm gonna miss you, babe.

18:08.128 --> 18:08.962
Wait.

18:10.005 --> 18:10.839
I don't want to leave.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.592
Great. Then, stay.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.386
New party, everyone. A staying party.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.514
No, I also don't want to stay.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.100
I'm done here,
but I don't want to go there.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.560
It's kind of your only options.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.229
No, they aren't.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.899
I want to learn to do
what you do, Michael.

18:28.982 --> 18:31.068
I want to be an architect,
design afterlives.

18:31.151 --> 18:35.489
Tahani, you're a wonderful person
but you're a person.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.366
-It's impossible.
-Nonsense.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.160
I can learn,
just like I learned all this other stuff.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.413
I've spent most of my life
pretending to help people.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.666
If I were an architect,
I could do it for real.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.334
Let me at least try.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.213
Don't make me talk to your manager.

18:51.713 --> 18:52.673
Oh!

18:53.757 --> 18:55.259
- That's my girl!
- Oh!

18:55.968 --> 18:56.844
Hey, Jeff.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.888
Boy, kind of getting away
from you here, huh?

18:59.972 --> 19:04.685
Yeah. I love frogs though,
so it's awesome.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.937
I did bring you one.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.231
Thanks, Tahani. Just toss it on the pile.

19:09.773 --> 19:13.527
<i>Wait, hang on, hang on.</i>
<i>So you can never tell a woman to smile?</i>

19:14.278 --> 19:16.989
<i>What if she'd legitimately be prettier</i>
<i>if she smiled?</i>

19:17.072 --> 19:18.198
<i>Aren't I helping her?</i>

19:18.866 --> 19:23.203
Glenn, Beadie,
this is your new intern, Tahani.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.289
Tahani! This is so neat.

19:25.372 --> 19:28.458
I haven't seen you
since I was exploded into goo.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.377
I didn't get any me on you, did I?

19:30.460 --> 19:33.672
You did, but it's all
goo under the bridge.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.800
Anyway, I want to learn everything.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.887
I shall start at the bottom
and earn my way up.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.681
To wit,
would anyone like a cup of antimatter?

19:42.764 --> 19:44.892
Sure,
I take mine with non-dairy neutrinos.

19:44.975 --> 19:45.893
Coming right up.

19:49.271 --> 19:53.609
Thank you, Michael, for everything.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.610
You're welcome.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.906
I brought you a little
"first day on the job" present.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.743
Once you're a big deal around here,

20:02.826 --> 20:05.662
I hope you don't mind
if I brag about knowing you.

20:06.622 --> 20:10.375
Name dropping is a little gauche, Michael,
but do as you must.

20:20.969 --> 20:25.390
"Working out the terms of
moral justification is an unending task."

20:25.474 --> 20:26.725
Boom!

20:26.808 --> 20:28.018
I did it.

20:28.101 --> 20:31.647
It only took me 2,000 Bearimys,
but I finally finished that book.

20:31.730 --> 20:36.526
Sucker! Reading you was
an unending task, but I freaking did it!

20:36.610 --> 20:39.238
-Congrats, babe.
-Thanks. What are you reading?

20:39.780 --> 20:40.614
<i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

20:40.697 --> 20:43.075
-Really?
-After a thousand lifetimes

20:43.158 --> 20:46.286
of reading the most difficult writings
in the world, I've acquired a new passion:

20:47.079 --> 20:48.330
garbage books!

20:48.413 --> 20:51.208
Do you think I would have been
a good symbologist...

20:51.833 --> 20:53.794
-if that were a real job?
-Yes, I do.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.296
You're very cute.
Come on, we gotta go to dinner.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.967
I can't believe
she learned to cook this well.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.468
When I first met Tahani on Earth,

21:01.551 --> 21:03.679
she was trying to shove jewelry
into a vending machine.

21:04.846 --> 21:08.558
Okay, well, if she is an architect,
then she should design my idea.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.812
A karaoke room that's also a tanning bed.

21:11.895 --> 21:12.896
Ooh, yes.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.983
And the harder you commit to the song,
the tanner you get.

21:16.066 --> 21:20.904
I am so glad that going through the system
did not totally change you two dingdongs.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.324
For dessert, we have to get the tiramisu.

21:24.408 --> 21:28.453
Man, Chidi Anagonye,
just casually making choices.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.915
I never thought I'd live to see it.
I mean, I guess I didn't.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.835
-That's right, 'cause we're all dead!

21:39.756 --> 21:40.882
That was so fun.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.052
Yeah. Yeah, it's always fun to see them.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.179
Every time we do it, it's fun.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.099
I had coffee with my mom the other day,
and she says hi.

21:49.182 --> 21:52.894
But she also finally learned
how to pronounce your mom's name,

21:53.603 --> 21:55.188
-which is good.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.358
Yeah. They were joking about that
last time we saw them.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.401
-Mmm.
-Remember?

21:59.484 --> 22:01.111
-Oh, right. Yeah.

22:03.822 --> 22:04.740
Shakespeare went through the door.

22:04.823 --> 22:05.949
-Really?
-Yeah.

22:06.616 --> 22:08.994
-Everyone's talking about it.
-It's probably for the best.

22:09.077 --> 22:12.664
His last 4,000 plays were not nearly
as good as the ones he wrote on Earth.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.418
I mean, did you see
<i>The Tempest Two: Here We Blow Again?</i>

22:16.501 --> 22:17.794
-Mmm.
-Woof!

22:23.008 --> 22:24.176
Do you mind if we go home?

22:24.843 --> 22:25.677
I'm tired.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.263
Sure. Okay.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.353
Uh...

22:37.022 --> 22:38.315
I'm gonna get ready for bed.

22:38.398 --> 22:41.318
Cool, I'm gonna take a little stroll.
I'll see you in a bit.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.277
Okay.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.078
- Dude!
-Hey. Perfect.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.454
Are these good lyrics?

22:53.330 --> 22:55.248
<i>♪ The psychedelic stardust ♪</i>

22:55.332 --> 22:57.334
<i>♪ And moonbeam banana-- ♪</i>

22:57.417 --> 22:58.794
No, stop. That's terrible.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.838
And we got a problem.
I think Chidi's gonna leave.

23:01.922 --> 23:02.756
Really?

23:04.091 --> 23:05.675
Did he say he was ready?

23:05.759 --> 23:09.554
He didn't say exactly that,
but he's getting close. I can tell.

23:09.638 --> 23:13.183
I need to do something to shake things up,
light a spark.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.894
-Oh. Janet?
-Hi, there.

23:15.977 --> 23:19.022
Hi. I think Chidi's almost ready
to walk through the door,

23:19.106 --> 23:20.107
and I need to keep him here,

23:20.190 --> 23:24.111
so, um, can you make me a bed
shaped like a giant highlighter,

23:24.194 --> 23:27.364
and a sexy, edible valedictorian robe?

23:27.447 --> 23:29.866
No, I think this calls
for something spiritual.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.369
Ah, okay, but if I do this right,
my man's gonna be talking to God,

23:32.452 --> 23:34.162
you know what I mean?
Wait, what do you mean?

23:34.246 --> 23:37.165
Forgive me, Eleanor,
but if Chidi's ready to go...

23:37.249 --> 23:38.375
it's time for him to go.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.710
Uh, he didn't say that yet, though.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.629
We're in classic Chidi gray area.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.799
You need to remind him
of what's great about this place.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.886
Oh, oh, remember where he took us
the first month we were all together?

23:49.970 --> 23:52.848
Oh, great idea. Yes! Janet, set the scene.

23:52.931 --> 23:56.393
Okay. Would you like it restored
to its original glory?

23:56.476 --> 23:58.937
No. First time he went, he was in college.

23:59.020 --> 24:02.983
Have it look and feel exactly like it was
that day when he fell in love with it.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.403
Also, pack me the edible robe.
That might seal the deal.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.738
Okay, you're all set.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.994
Hey, guess what? Surprise trip, come on.

24:14.077 --> 24:16.663
-Surprise trip? Now?
-Yeah.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.249
Special fun trip, just us two. Let's go.

24:19.332 --> 24:21.209
Can I change out of my pajamas first?

24:21.293 --> 24:23.044
Let the door do it. Come on!

24:23.128 --> 24:24.671
-Come on, come on, come on!
-Okay.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.891
Oh... Oh, man, Eleanor.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.435
Right? We haven't been here in so long.

24:38.518 --> 24:42.731
Athens. Man, this city,
it takes my breath away every time.

24:43.356 --> 24:46.359
Talk it out, bud. Tell me everything
you know about this place.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.694
Because, full disclosure,

24:47.777 --> 24:49.404
I didn't really listen
the first time you told me.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.865
Well, I mean...

24:51.948 --> 24:53.116
That's the Acropolis.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.744
Oh, and this is the Pnyx.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.455
Thousands of Athenians would gather here

24:58.538 --> 25:01.833
and listen to people discuss their city
and its laws

25:01.917 --> 25:04.044
from that stage right there.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.213
This is literally where democracy started.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.589
Well, that's fine and dandy,

25:07.672 --> 25:10.759
but as you might know,
I'm kind of a philosophy gal.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.762
Where were the big brains hanging out?

25:14.846 --> 25:18.225
Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, Diogenes...

25:18.308 --> 25:21.728
they all gathered right here
in the Agora.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.648
It was like the Avengers,
but for super thinkers.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.526
Come on, you brought me here.
You knew what was gonna happen.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.737
No, I love that you're so happy.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.239
Hey, let me ask you something.

25:32.322 --> 25:36.368
Is it weird that when I picture
Ancient Greeks I make them really hot?

25:36.451 --> 25:39.871
To me, Aristotle is basically
John Stamos with a beard.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.874
-Honestly, that's how I picture him, too.
-Good, same page.

26:02.018 --> 26:04.354
What's this called again? "Kouluvri"?

26:04.437 --> 26:07.774
Koulouri. Man, I lived on these
when I was here.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.694
I like to picture
a young Chidi Anagonye here,

26:10.777 --> 26:14.489
reading, nerding out,
treating himself to a koulouri

26:14.572 --> 26:17.993
if he had an astute insight
into Aristotelian virtue ethics.

26:18.076 --> 26:21.204
That... is accurate.

26:21.288 --> 26:25.375
That is an accurate picture
of 20-year-old me.

26:27.460 --> 26:30.297
This was so special. Thank you.

26:30.964 --> 26:31.923
Should we head home?

26:33.091 --> 26:36.553
Nope, because we're not done yet.

26:36.636 --> 26:39.306
There's more special trip. Janet.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.599
Hi, there. You enjoying your trip, Chidi?

26:41.683 --> 26:44.227
Yes, we are, but it's not over yet.

26:44.811 --> 26:48.356
We are ready to head
to destination number two, remember?

26:48.440 --> 26:50.191
Yes, of course.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.693
Head right this way.

26:57.198 --> 26:59.367
Oh, man. Oh, wow.

27:00.285 --> 27:03.997
-Paris.
-Yes, Paris. Obviously.

27:04.706 --> 27:09.085
My favorite city. And you even picked
the ideal weather.

27:09.169 --> 27:13.298
Overcast and chilly.
Perfect for staying inside and reading.

27:13.381 --> 27:15.383
Is this what you were hinting to me?

27:15.467 --> 27:18.053
I was thinking Six Flags,
but this is way better.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.307
I used to come to this café every day
when I lived here.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.434
I tried to sit
in a different seat each time,

27:24.517 --> 27:27.854
so I could eventually say
that I definitely sat

27:27.937 --> 27:30.857
in the exact same place
as Jean-Paul Sartre,

27:30.940 --> 27:36.071
Simone de Beauvoir, and Richard Wright,
Brecht, James Baldwin...

27:36.154 --> 27:39.532
Well, we got all the time
in the world now, baby.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.327
Put that booty
in a seat warmed by history.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.956
Eleanor, I know what you're doing.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.211
Being the best eternal girlfriend ever?
Guilty.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.421
Let's take a walk.

27:55.673 --> 27:59.761
So, Eleanor, here it is.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.013
I love you...

28:02.097 --> 28:05.016
-completely and utterly--
-Oh, crap.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.059
But I have to go.

28:06.726 --> 28:08.311
But you don't, though.

28:08.395 --> 28:11.314
You don't have to go.
You don't have to leave me.

28:11.398 --> 28:16.277
I don't want to leave you.
I'm just... ready to leave.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.988
I have the same feeling
that the others described,

28:19.072 --> 28:21.199
a kind of quietude in my soul.

28:21.282 --> 28:23.368
But... you just had it.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.620
What if those other dummies
didn't wait long enough

28:25.703 --> 28:27.163
and the feeling fades,

28:27.247 --> 28:29.916
and you get to spend
another billion Bearimys

28:29.999 --> 28:33.128
in fake afterlife Europe
with your kickass girlfriend?

28:33.211 --> 28:34.337
I didn't just have it.

28:35.171 --> 28:36.714
I've had it a long time.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.343
Remember that day
we were with our parents?

28:41.136 --> 28:42.971
My mom kissed you goodbye...

28:43.638 --> 28:47.851
and got lipstick on your cheek,
and your mom rubbed it off.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.813
I don't know why that was it, but...

28:53.148 --> 28:54.315
that was it.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.777
-And I didn't want to tell you, because...

28:59.195 --> 29:02.198
-Because...
-No, man, this can't... be.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.868
Because Jason's gone,

29:04.951 --> 29:08.455
Tahani's off doing her thing
and I'm not ready to go.

29:08.538 --> 29:11.458
So if you leave, then I'm alone here.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.126
I was alone
my whole life...

29:14.377 --> 29:16.880
and I told myself I like it that way,
but I don't.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.259
I like being with you.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.263
Okay. I won't go.

29:26.389 --> 29:28.391
-Really?
-Yeah, I won't go. There's...

29:29.684 --> 29:31.895
There is still plenty to do.

29:32.896 --> 29:33.813
I'll stay.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.401
Who's ready for Six Flags?

29:38.485 --> 29:41.571
Oh, we're good. We got it.
He's gonna stay.

29:46.284 --> 29:50.497
So, what do you wanna do?
Turn into birds and fly to Notre Dame?

29:51.039 --> 29:52.499
Stand on top of the Eiffel Tower

29:52.582 --> 29:55.210
and throw water balloons
onto imaginary tourists?

29:55.293 --> 29:56.628
Whatever you want to do.

29:57.253 --> 30:01.090
Okay, well, let's freshen up,
have dinner at some schmancy restaurant,

30:01.174 --> 30:02.717
order a million-dollar bottle of wine,

30:02.801 --> 30:05.386
even though it tastes
exactly like cheap, stupid wine,

30:05.470 --> 30:07.430
sit in a room at the Georges Cinq

30:07.514 --> 30:10.683
and watch <i>Real Housewives of...</i>
whatever city they're doing that in now.

30:11.893 --> 30:12.852
Love it.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.314
I'm gonna walk around my old neighborhood.
See where I used to live.

30:16.397 --> 30:18.858
-Meet you at the restaurant?
-Yeah.

30:18.942 --> 30:19.984
All right.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.932
Let's see what's on the menu.

30:52.392 --> 30:56.104
"Literally anything
you could possibly imagine." Hmm.

30:56.187 --> 30:57.355
What are you thinking?

30:58.356 --> 31:03.027
"Working out the terms of
moral justification is an unending task."

31:03.611 --> 31:06.197
That's what I was thinking about.
That sentence.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.740
You wanna eat that sentence for dinner?

31:07.824 --> 31:10.285
Can we eat words?
'Cause I asked Janet about this and--

31:10.368 --> 31:14.247
No, no, it's the last line
of Scanlon's book, remember?

31:14.330 --> 31:15.164
Ah.

31:15.248 --> 31:17.292
The whole book is about
how we should try to find rules

31:17.375 --> 31:21.129
other people can't reasonably reject,
and then he ends it by saying,

31:21.212 --> 31:25.884
the search for how to find those rules
will go on forever.

31:26.634 --> 31:30.388
I proposed a rule
that Chidis shouldn't be allowed to leave

31:31.264 --> 31:33.182
because it would make Eleanors sad.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.351
And I could do this forever.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.521
Zip you around the universe,
showing you cool stuff,

31:39.439 --> 31:44.736
and I'd still never find the justification
for getting you to stay...

31:46.738 --> 31:49.032
because it's a selfish rule.

31:50.575 --> 31:54.454
I owe it to you to let you go.

32:16.225 --> 32:18.603
I was never good at being sad,

32:18.686 --> 32:22.231
partly because
my mom straight up told me not to be.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.944
But this is sad, man.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.863
You got a John Locke quote

32:28.947 --> 32:32.241
or a piece of Kantian wisdom
you can throw at me?

32:32.325 --> 32:36.329
Those guys were more focused
on rules and regulations.

32:37.330 --> 32:41.626
For spiritual stuff,
you gotta turn to the East.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.878
I'll take anything you got. Hit me.

32:47.215 --> 32:51.094
Picture a wave... in the ocean.

32:53.179 --> 32:55.139
You can see it, measure it, its height,

32:55.223 --> 33:01.562
the way the sunlight refracts
when it passes through and it's there,

33:01.646 --> 33:04.482
and you can see it,
and you know what it is, it's a wave.

33:05.650 --> 33:10.363
And then it crashes on the shore...
and it's gone.

33:12.407 --> 33:16.369
But the water is still there.

33:18.579 --> 33:24.627
The wave was just a different way
for the water to be,

33:24.711 --> 33:26.170
for a little while.

33:29.090 --> 33:31.843
That's one conception of death,
for a Buddhist.

33:32.969 --> 33:36.389
The wave returns to the ocean...

33:39.600 --> 33:41.227
-...where it came from,

33:42.937 --> 33:44.814
and where it's supposed to be.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.277
-Not bad, Buddhists.
-Not bad.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.073
None of this is bad.

34:02.832 --> 34:05.376
-I need you to do me one last favor.
-Mmm-hmm?

34:07.003 --> 34:09.338
Say goodbye to me now.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.382
Then leave before I wake up.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.893
You can sit on that bench
as long as you'd like

35:03.976 --> 35:07.772
and whenever you're ready,
you just walk through.

35:10.024 --> 35:11.025
I'm ready.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.295
Oh, dip! You're back.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.131
Jason?

35:33.214 --> 35:34.048
Yeah!

35:34.132 --> 35:36.676
What... but how... why...

35:37.385 --> 35:39.053
Funny story.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.180
-Remember how I made you something...
-Uh-huh.

35:41.264 --> 35:43.182
...and I thought I lost it
because it wasn't in my pocket?

35:43.266 --> 35:45.434
-Uh-huh?
-Turns out, it was in my other pocket.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.854
-By the time I found it, you were gone.

35:47.937 --> 35:49.981
I was just gonna leave it for you,
but I was worried

35:50.064 --> 35:54.986
it would get eaten by that magic squirrel,
so I decided to wait for you to come back.

35:55.069 --> 35:59.824
Every so often, a different Janet came,
but I knew it wasn't you.

35:59.907 --> 36:02.785
Jason, it's been, like, 1,000 Bearimys.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.371
I know. But I wanted to see you again.

36:06.455 --> 36:07.748
It was actually pretty easy to wait.

36:08.332 --> 36:12.628
<i>I sort of just sat quietly</i>
<i>and let my mind drift away...</i>

36:13.671 --> 36:17.758
<i>thought about you</i>
<i>and the infinity of the universe.</i>

36:18.342 --> 36:19.594
Kind of like a monk.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.053
What do you mean?

36:22.597 --> 36:23.431
Um...

36:29.312 --> 36:30.897
Looks good, not-a-girl.

36:35.610 --> 36:36.819
Chidi, wait up.

36:44.118 --> 36:48.497
Hey-o! Time to go nuts,
because I brought doughnuts!

36:48.581 --> 36:49.457
Huh! No one's here?

36:49.540 --> 36:51.500
Shoot. That was gonna be a big laugh.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.128
Hey, sweetie. Did you not get the message?

36:54.212 --> 36:56.172
No. Why, was the meeting canceled?

36:56.255 --> 36:59.842
Uh, yeah, forever.
We dissolved the council.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.427
-What?
-We don't need it anymore.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.471
Your system's working perfectly.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.224
Millions of humans
passing their tests, you know.

37:06.307 --> 37:08.935
Oh, Vicky's really killing it
on the training. So, it's all good.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.062
Well, you... all right, well, hang on.

37:11.145 --> 37:14.815
Look, how are we even sure
that this is the right system?

37:14.899 --> 37:16.651
I mean, honestly, I think Shawn was right.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.986
This whole thing sucks,
and we should start from scratch.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.782
Relax, worrywart. Take a load off, huh?

37:22.865 --> 37:27.620
Enjoy yourself. You know what I just
discovered recently? Podcasts.

37:27.703 --> 37:31.374
There's, like, a billion of them
and they just keep coming.

37:31.457 --> 37:32.541
-Hmm.
-Now, scoot!

37:32.625 --> 37:36.003
I got a new <i>Radiolab</i> to listen to
about how clams learn.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.673
- Hmm.
-Pretty excited.

37:51.352 --> 37:53.062
<i>I love you.</i>

37:53.145 --> 37:54.605
<i>And you don't need to respond</i>

37:54.689 --> 37:57.400
<i>'cause I know</i>
<i>you have trouble saying how you feel--</i>

37:57.483 --> 37:58.901
<i>I love you, too.</i>

38:02.071 --> 38:03.531
Knock, knock, knock.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.783
Oh. Hey, what's up?

38:05.866 --> 38:06.867
Can I talk to you for a sec?

38:06.951 --> 38:10.579
Yeah, sure, why not? Hey, Derek?

38:10.663 --> 38:13.457
Yes, Mindy? What can Derek do for you?

38:13.541 --> 38:17.295
Eleanor and I are gonna talk for a bit,
so go into your nethersphere.

38:17.378 --> 38:18.504
That's Derek?

38:18.587 --> 38:22.967
Mindy has rebooted Derek more than
151 million times.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.553
Derek is now both
a singular point in space,

38:25.636 --> 38:28.306
and yet Derek also contains space itself.

38:28.389 --> 38:31.142
The nexus of Derek is without dimension.

38:31.225 --> 38:33.102
The moment of Derek's creation

38:33.185 --> 38:35.438
and the eventual heat death
of the universe

38:35.521 --> 38:38.107
are now inexorably the same.

38:38.190 --> 38:40.484
Ugh, you are so annoying!

38:43.654 --> 38:44.655
Want a beer?

38:44.739 --> 38:47.074
So that's how you spend your days,

38:47.158 --> 38:50.786
wandering around, searching for the thing
that makes you complete?

38:50.870 --> 38:51.787
Pretty much.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.874
I thought it was connected to my parents
or my friends.

38:54.957 --> 38:57.710
But now I think
it might be something else.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.003
I think it might be you.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.172
I think my final mission

39:01.255 --> 39:04.925
might be to convince you
to go through the system. Take the test.

39:06.427 --> 39:07.553
You know, when I first met you,

39:07.636 --> 39:11.932
I thought...
"Well, there's a chick I understand."

39:12.016 --> 39:15.561
Lone wolf, totally independent,
knows what she wants.

39:15.644 --> 39:17.438
Cocaine and self-pleasure.

39:17.521 --> 39:21.484
Right. But I actually think
you're a version of me

39:21.567 --> 39:23.319
if I'd never met my friends.

39:23.402 --> 39:27.948
You're the worst-case scenario
of what I could've become. No offense.

39:28.032 --> 39:32.328
None taken. Look, the thing is, Eleanor,
I am fine with where I am.

39:32.411 --> 39:34.747
See, I don't think you are.

39:34.830 --> 39:37.124
Or at least, you could be better.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.419
If we're cut from the same cloth,
then trust me,

39:40.503 --> 39:42.797
there's a greater happiness
waiting for you

39:42.880 --> 39:44.965
if you form bonds with other people.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.051
And I think you know that.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.928
You told me about me and Chidi that time.

39:49.011 --> 39:51.847
You showed me the tape.
You said you were rooting for us.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.891
I think you have the ability to care.

39:56.060 --> 39:59.563
I don't know.
Caring just seems like a lot of work.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.566
-Mmm.
-And I have been on my own for so long.

40:02.650 --> 40:06.112
I can't imagine putting my fate
in the hands of some stranger.

40:06.195 --> 40:08.239
I thought you might say that.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.617
Hello, gorgeous.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.577
Eleanor!

40:14.161 --> 40:18.165
And Mindy St. Claire!
As I neither live nor breathe.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.667
What brings you ladies here?

40:19.750 --> 40:23.587
I'm trying to convince Mindy
to enter the system after all this time.

40:23.671 --> 40:27.383
She's a little worried
about who might end up designing her test.

40:27.466 --> 40:28.968
Say no more. I'm on the case.

40:29.051 --> 40:31.762
Really? Are you certified or whatever?

40:31.846 --> 40:34.598
Well, not yet,
but it won't be long, right, Shawn?

40:34.682 --> 40:39.478
I think you'll find that Tahani
will be certified very soon.

40:40.354 --> 40:44.316
Did that sound evil?
I didn't mean it to. I was sincere.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.526
Force of habit.

40:45.609 --> 40:48.779
I do think you'll find
that Tahani will be certified very...

40:48.863 --> 40:49.697
Shut up, Glenn!

40:49.780 --> 40:53.742
Great. So, you go back to your old life,
chill with your floating Derek head.

40:53.826 --> 40:56.245
When Tahani gets certified,
you enter the system,

40:56.328 --> 40:57.913
Tahani designs your test. Deal?

40:59.373 --> 41:01.208
Why not? Something new.

41:02.376 --> 41:05.671
Thanks for giving a crap about me.

41:05.754 --> 41:10.634
I don't really give a crap about myself,
so it's nice that someone does.

41:11.886 --> 41:14.346
I'm really glad I filmed you having sex.

41:15.097 --> 41:16.098
Me, too.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.981
You can sit on that bench
as long as you want.

41:24.064 --> 41:26.317
Whenever you're ready,
you just walk through.

41:27.234 --> 41:29.570
Well, good, because I'm definitely ready.

41:31.197 --> 41:32.448
I'm ready.

41:34.825 --> 41:36.243
I'm not ready.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.037
Damn it, Janet. What the fork?

41:38.120 --> 41:40.623
I should be ready and I'm not.

41:40.706 --> 41:41.707
But I am.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.754
-Michael, what are you doing?
-I'm going through the door.

41:46.837 --> 41:51.842
There's nothing left for me to do.
I feel sated and complete.

41:51.926 --> 41:54.011
I'm not sure
you're thinking this through, dude.

41:54.094 --> 41:54.929
Yes, I am.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.680
A calm has washed over me...

41:57.431 --> 41:58.307
Blah, blah, blah.

41:58.390 --> 41:59.225
Goodbye.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.275
Did I go through the wrong way?

42:08.359 --> 42:10.069
Wait, wait, just one...

42:10.152 --> 42:11.987
This is gonna look silly,
but it probably will work...

42:13.364 --> 42:14.532
Michael, what are you doing?

42:14.615 --> 42:19.119
I am returning my damn essence
to the damn fabric of the damn universe.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.163
Oh, yeah. Okay.

42:21.247 --> 42:24.708
Oh, there we go. It's working now.

42:24.792 --> 42:28.963
It's working. I'm leaving. Bye!

42:30.798 --> 42:33.592
It's not working,
because you're looking. Stop looking!

42:33.676 --> 42:35.636
Michael, that door is not for you.

42:35.719 --> 42:38.764
Why not? I invented the damn thing.

42:38.847 --> 42:40.015
You know, this stinks!

42:40.099 --> 42:43.143
You guys get to move on,
but I am trapped here forever?

42:43.227 --> 42:44.103
How is that fair?

42:44.186 --> 42:45.563
Oh! I got it!

42:45.646 --> 42:47.231
Eleanor, come here...

42:48.399 --> 42:51.193
You go through, and give me a piggy-back.
We can trick it.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.111
- No.
-Michael.

42:52.194 --> 42:53.737
Ow! Michael, no!

42:53.821 --> 42:58.033
Michael! All right, come with me.

42:58.117 --> 42:59.618
Fire squids are heavy!

42:59.702 --> 43:00.828
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.956
New people are getting in all the time.

43:04.039 --> 43:07.209
Tahani's still around.
Maybe team up with her,

43:07.293 --> 43:10.004
-design some afterlife neighborhoods?
-I did that already, remember?

43:10.087 --> 43:14.258
Spent 50 Bearimys making
new neighborhoods for new residents.

43:14.341 --> 43:17.678
When you've already designed
the ultimate one, it's kind of a letdown.

43:18.262 --> 43:22.266
I've loved being here,
but Jason's gone, Chidi's gone.

43:22.349 --> 43:25.311
You know, even Doug Forcett
went through the door.

43:25.394 --> 43:28.981
That was probably for the best.
That guy partied so hard when he was here.

43:29.064 --> 43:31.859
I guess I'll just stay here forever,
you know, putter around,

43:31.942 --> 43:35.321
doing mundane things,
like some sad, old retiree.

43:35.404 --> 43:38.365
Maybe I'll have Janet
make me a hardware store,

43:38.449 --> 43:41.619
so I can buy a hex wrench
that I don't really need.

43:43.078 --> 43:44.038
Cockamamie!

43:44.121 --> 43:47.625
That's what I think of your plan,
I think it's cockamamie!

43:47.708 --> 43:51.045
I think it's a great plan,
and I bet deep down you do too.

43:51.128 --> 43:53.255
-It sets a bad precedent.
-Babe!

43:53.339 --> 43:57.134
No one else is ever
gonna wanna do this. Plus, if they ask,

43:57.217 --> 44:00.262
you just say, "Sure, pal,
go save every soul in the universe

44:00.346 --> 44:01.180
and then we got a deal."

44:01.263 --> 44:02.723
And think about it this way,

44:02.806 --> 44:08.979
if you do this, you'll never have to
hear from any of us again ever again.

44:09.063 --> 44:10.064
Ooh.

44:11.023 --> 44:13.484
Now that is tempting,
'cause y'all are annoying.

44:13.567 --> 44:17.071
I mean, you did save the universe and all,
but your tone...

44:17.154 --> 44:18.155
It's your tone.

44:18.238 --> 44:19.281
I know.

44:20.866 --> 44:23.786
Michael, come on in.

44:31.543 --> 44:33.712
All my Earth stuff!

44:34.838 --> 44:35.839
Oh!

44:35.923 --> 44:38.092
My old bowling ball.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.593
Oh!

44:39.677 --> 44:41.428
Hi, paper clips!

44:41.512 --> 44:43.055
What prompted all this?

44:43.138 --> 44:45.099
You know, it took me a while
to figure it out.

44:45.182 --> 44:49.770
But earlier when you were walking back
and forth through the door, it hit me.

44:49.853 --> 44:54.108
You will never be at peace until
you get the one thing you truly want.

44:57.152 --> 45:00.447
I'm... I'm gonna be...

45:00.531 --> 45:02.116
A real boy, Pinocchio.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.952
The Judge gave me the power
to make you an actual human.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.204
Goodbye, fire squid.

45:07.287 --> 45:09.164
Hello, silver fox.

45:09.998 --> 45:13.085
Oh, Eleanor! Oh, my goodness!

45:13.168 --> 45:14.795
Now, you need to be sure about this.

45:14.878 --> 45:17.673
You're gonna live down there for, like...

45:17.756 --> 45:20.008
some amount of time,
you'll die, really die,

45:20.092 --> 45:23.512
then you'll enter an afterlife test,
be judged on what you did, the whole deal.

45:23.595 --> 45:25.973
At least, so we think.

45:26.056 --> 45:29.059
While you're down there,
this entire system could be changed.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.812
Shawn might launch a coup.
Someone could design a whole new system.

45:31.895 --> 45:35.566
You won't really know
what's gonna happen to you.

45:36.483 --> 45:38.318
That's what makes it special.

45:38.402 --> 45:42.990
I won't exactly know
what's going to happen after I die.

45:43.699 --> 45:45.451
Nothing more human than that.

45:47.077 --> 45:49.830
Besides texting people
that you're five minutes away

45:49.913 --> 45:51.623
when you haven't even left the house.

45:54.543 --> 45:58.046
Thank you, Eleanor. Thank you.

46:01.049 --> 46:02.551
You're very welcome.

46:06.513 --> 46:10.309
-Hey, Mike. Where you headed today?
-Earth, actually.

46:10.392 --> 46:13.270
Oh! Been a while.
Here's the return clicker.

46:13.353 --> 46:15.647
No need. One-way trip.

46:16.648 --> 46:17.733
Wow.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.068
Okay.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.154
Good luck.

46:22.237 --> 46:23.822
Thank you.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.616
-I have something for you.
- Uh-huh.

46:31.288 --> 46:32.122
He's real!

46:33.499 --> 46:35.167
It's real. He's a real frog!

46:35.250 --> 46:37.252
-Yes, it sure is.

46:38.670 --> 46:39.588
Thank you.

46:39.671 --> 46:43.175
You know what?
I got the perfect name for him...

46:45.260 --> 46:46.512
Mr. Jumpy Legs.

46:47.387 --> 46:48.722
Oh.

46:48.805 --> 46:49.765
I thought you were gonna...

46:50.807 --> 46:51.892
Never mind.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.229
Hello, Mr. Jumpy Legs.

46:55.896 --> 47:01.068
Okay, so here's your driver's license
and your social security card.

47:01.151 --> 47:02.486
I set up a bank account for you.

47:02.569 --> 47:04.488
There's enough money in there
so you don't starve,

47:04.571 --> 47:06.865
but not so much
that you become an entitled jerk.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.076
Thank you, Janet.

47:09.159 --> 47:11.203
Make a doctor's appointment
as soon as you get down there.

47:11.286 --> 47:14.081
And no salty food. You have to keep
your blood pressure down.

47:14.164 --> 47:15.791
You have blood now.

47:16.375 --> 47:18.418
I'll be fine. I'll be okay.

47:19.211 --> 47:21.046
I know. I just worry.

47:25.175 --> 47:26.677
I'll see you again, you know.

47:27.970 --> 47:29.429
I'll see you when I get back.

47:31.890 --> 47:32.933
Okay.

47:39.356 --> 47:43.110
If you rent a car, don't pay
for the insurance, it's a scam. Okay.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.372
Man, it's hot.

47:57.124 --> 47:59.376
But it's a dry heat.

48:03.755 --> 48:07.884
So, as I mentioned before, you can sit
on this bench as long as you want.

48:09.011 --> 48:11.430
And whenever you're ready,
you just walk through.

48:12.931 --> 48:14.725
Care to join me for a bit?

48:19.605 --> 48:20.439
Margarita?

48:21.231 --> 48:22.065
Always.

48:27.863 --> 48:33.327
Okay, top three moments
of your not-life with us. Go.

48:33.910 --> 48:38.040
You telling us that we should try
to help other people on Earth.

48:38.123 --> 48:41.001
The moment that
we all got into the Good Place for real.

48:41.084 --> 48:45.756
And then it's an 8-million-way tie
of every time Jason and I kissed.

48:45.839 --> 48:46.673
He was a really good kisser.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.091
I bet he was.

48:50.844 --> 48:52.137
I wonder how Michael's doing?

48:52.846 --> 48:56.099
I assume he's doing the same
as every human.

48:56.183 --> 48:58.143
Three, two, one...

48:58.226 --> 48:59.436
<i> Some good days.</i>

48:59.519 --> 49:01.438
Happy New Year!

49:01.521 --> 49:03.357
<i> Some bad days.</i>

49:03.440 --> 49:05.525
She's gonna be okay.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.903
This city has really good hospitals.

49:09.321 --> 49:10.781
<i> He's got a few friends.</i>

49:10.864 --> 49:14.785
You're such a good boy, Jason.
Such a good boy.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.080
<i> A few people he can't stand.</i>

49:18.163 --> 49:19.164
Oh...

49:22.501 --> 49:25.587
<i>He's learning some things,</i>
<i>all by himself.</i>

49:29.007 --> 49:32.177
<i>And, hopefully, learning to ask for help</i>
<i>when he needs it.</i>

49:33.595 --> 49:35.639
Try like this. Fingers this way.

49:40.477 --> 49:44.731
You have no idea how long I've been trying
to figure that out.

49:44.815 --> 49:48.568
Well, everybody needs a teacher.
So, do it again.

49:48.652 --> 49:51.947
<i>He's messing up,</i>
<i>and trying again, and messing up again,</i>

49:52.030 --> 49:55.909
<i>and then getting things wrong,</i>
<i>and then trying to make them right.</i>

49:55.992 --> 49:58.370
That's what everyone does.

49:58.453 --> 50:00.789
-To Michael.
-To Michael.

50:00.872 --> 50:02.082
Mmm.

50:04.084 --> 50:06.169
What do you think happens
when people walk through the door?

50:06.753 --> 50:09.756
It's the only thing in the universe
I don't know.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.299
I don't know, either.

50:12.551 --> 50:14.511
The wave returns to the ocean.

50:15.679 --> 50:20.225
What the ocean does with the water
after that is anyone's guess.

50:21.017 --> 50:25.605
But as a very wise not-robot once told me,

50:26.189 --> 50:27.858
"The true joy is in the mystery."

50:29.735 --> 50:31.987
Do you mind
if I stay here until you're gone?

50:32.696 --> 50:34.448
Only if you say that thing I taught you.

50:36.241 --> 50:40.662
I hate to see you walk through
the final door at the edge of existence,

50:40.746 --> 50:42.706
but I love to watch you leave.

50:42.789 --> 50:43.623
There we go.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.945
Hey, this was delivered to my building
by mistake. I think it's yours.

51:55.028 --> 51:57.280
-Oh. Hey, thanks so much.
-Mmm-hmm.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.201
Oh, wow! I think I know what this is.

52:04.120 --> 52:06.456
Oh, my. Oh, my.

52:07.249 --> 52:13.255
Look at that. Oh, thank you.
Thank you so very, very much!

52:13.338 --> 52:15.715
Yeah, no problem. Take it easy.

52:15.799 --> 52:17.008
I'll do you one better.

52:18.969 --> 52:23.640
I'll say this to you, my friend,
with all the love in my heart,

52:23.723 --> 52:26.434
and all the wisdom of the universe.

52:28.395 --> 52:29.855
Take it sleazy.

52:33.859 --> 52:34.693
