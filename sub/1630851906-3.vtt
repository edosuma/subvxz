00:01.120 --> 00:02.600
CONDUCTOR'S BELL DINGS

00:06.440 --> 00:08.880
CONDUCTOR: All right, yes, please,
and thank you.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.400
All aboard for the last bus.

00:10.400 --> 00:13.080
That's it,
move right along down inside.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.720
Oh, wait!
All right, darling, hop on.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.960
Bleeding brass monkeys.
Ta for waiting.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.800
Always room for one more on top.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.120
BELL DINGS

00:43.000 --> 00:45.680
WIND HOWLS

00:54.400 --> 00:55.800
CONDUCTOR: Yes, please.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.480
Any more for Mrs Moore?

00:58.760 --> 01:01.120
How far are you going, then, love?
All the way, is it?

01:01.120 --> 01:02.360
HE CHUCKLES

01:20.840 --> 01:23.200
CONDUCTOR: Chipping Compton,
the end of the route.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.640
Turning around here for Oxford.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.800
CONDUCTOR:
End of the route!

01:38.800 --> 01:41.040
All passengers alight, please!

01:44.080 --> 01:46.400
You'll be all right a minute?

01:46.400 --> 01:48.160
Call of nature.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.280
Geez...

02:06.640 --> 02:08.160
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

02:08.160 --> 02:09.960
WOMAN SCREAMS

02:25.840 --> 02:28.240
You'll get frostbite.
Hey?

02:28.240 --> 02:29.640
You're flying tonight.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.200
THEY BOTH LAUGH

02:33.200 --> 02:35.720
Come on, then, let's get going.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.200
The body was found by the
local beat man just after six.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.800
Do we know who he was?

03:08.800 --> 03:10.960
Professor Patrick Stanton.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.960
Going by an envelope in his pocket
and the maths papers in his case,

03:13.960 --> 03:16.120
he was a don at Wolsey College.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.720
The wallet's untouched,
so it doesn't look to be a robbery.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.520
There's a bus ticket in his pocket

03:21.520 --> 03:24.120
that says he boarded the 33
at stage two in town.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.840
Does he live out this way?

03:25.840 --> 03:27.840
The beat man doesn't recognise him
as local.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.480
So, visiting someone, maybe.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.880
He'd have to be, wouldn't he?

03:31.880 --> 03:34.000
Bugger all else here,
except for the boneyard.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.040
And it's a bit late
for leaving flowers.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.880
We'll see if door-to-door
gives us anyone who knows him.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.320
Doctor...

03:42.400 --> 03:44.040
What have we got?

03:44.040 --> 03:45.760
Given the temperature overnight,

03:45.760 --> 03:48.920
it's quite difficult
to offer a precise time.

03:48.920 --> 03:53.360
But most likely the time of death
was between ten and midnight.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.400
Cause of death
would appear to be loss of blood...

03:57.320 --> 04:00.280
..as the result
of a number of stab wounds.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.520
I'll be able to say exactly
which have been fatal

04:03.520 --> 04:05.080
after the postmortem.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.920
What's that with his eyes?

04:08.920 --> 04:11.720
Someone's carved a cross
into each one.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.200
Some sort of religious nutcase?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.680
Oh...

04:15.680 --> 04:17.960
Do you think, Sergeant?

04:17.960 --> 04:21.600
It struck me
as perhaps more clown-like.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.880
I don't think Billy Smart's
will pack in many looking like that.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.960
The kids would run out screaming.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.800
Signs and wonders, Chief Inspector.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.160
Signs and wonders.

04:32.160 --> 04:36.040
Something right up Morse's apse,
I'd have thought.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.880
Not with you this morning?

04:39.960 --> 04:41.320
No, he's, erm...

04:42.360 --> 04:43.960
..rung in sick.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.280
Ah.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.840
Yes, well, there's a lot of it about
this time of year.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.080
Unless there's anything else,
shall we say two o'clock?

05:04.640 --> 05:06.360
HE GROANS

05:14.600 --> 05:16.800
HE EXHALES HEAVILY AND SLOWLY

05:18.800 --> 05:23.240
According to the Master of Wolsey,
Professor Stanton was well-liked.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.640
He'd been at the college
for six years and

05:25.640 --> 05:27.400
lived alone in North Oxford.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.200
What about family?
A sister in Swanage.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.000
Other than that, a single man
without an enemy in the world,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.560
as far as we can make out.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.160
And where's Morse in all of this?

05:37.160 --> 05:40.080
One can generally depend upon him
to contribute something useful.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.320
He's off sick, sir.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.680
He was off sick several days
last month, wasn't he?

05:43.680 --> 05:46.480
Is he seeing anyone?
Not that I know, sir.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.480
He's just a bit run down, I expect.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.000
I'm no fool, Thursday.
And nor are you.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.240
He's not been himself
for quite some time.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.880
That Venice business, presumably.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.560
He blames himself, sir, for...

06:01.040 --> 06:02.760
Well, for everything, really.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.280
It's nearly a year.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.120
If he can't pull himself
out of it...

06:07.880 --> 06:11.240
Wasn't there talk about a transfer
to Kidlington at some stage,

06:11.240 --> 06:12.920
a change of scene,
leave all this behind?

06:12.920 --> 06:14.880
There was, sir, but...

06:14.880 --> 06:15.920
Well, to be honest,

06:15.920 --> 06:17.680
I've just got used
to having him around.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.520
We're officers, Thursday.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.760
The men come first, always.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.960
Whatever the personal cost.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.200
Well...

06:33.720 --> 06:36.320
This was a sustained attack.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.360
The majority of the wounds...

06:38.360 --> 06:39.680
Sergeant.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.360
..were to the front
and back of the torso.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.000
The wounds penetrated the aorta,

06:46.000 --> 06:49.360
the descending thoracic
and abdominal areas.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.240
Another,
the left ventricle of the heart.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.240
He really didn't stand a chance
of recovery from either.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.960
Anything on the weapon?

06:56.960 --> 07:01.760
A large single-bladed knife
about eight to 12 inches in length.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.600
Right or left-handed?

07:03.600 --> 07:06.560
The injuries to the eyes aside,

07:06.560 --> 07:10.040
these were stabbing wounds,
rather than slashes.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.080
But more likely right than left.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.720
Doctor.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.960
So, what have we got there?
Not much.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.240
Just his work papers,

07:20.240 --> 07:22.760
which he looks
to be marking up in red ink.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.720
And an envelope
addressed to Stanton at Wolsey.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.480
Sent the day before yesterday.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.400
How did you make out
at Chipping Compton?

07:29.400 --> 07:31.000
It's a bit of a dead-and-alive hole.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.200
He wasn't known
to anyone of the locals.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.440
At least, nobody recognised
his name or description.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.520
So, what was he doing there, then?

07:39.120 --> 07:40.600
HOOVER WHIRS

07:40.600 --> 07:42.360
TELEPHONE RINGS

07:43.480 --> 07:45.280
SHE TURNS THE HOOVER OFF

07:49.280 --> 07:51.120
Oxford 2831.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.320
MAN: 'May I speak to Mr Thursday?'
No.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.720
No, he's at work.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.400
This is Mrs Thursday.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.120
Doesn't ring a bell.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.640
We've a ticket
that says he was on your bus.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.120
May have been. Don't remember him.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.360
Many left on board
when you got to Chipping Compton?

08:07.360 --> 08:08.760
One or two maybe.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.600
Could you describe them?
The usual, innit?

08:11.600 --> 08:14.520
Business types, academics,
the odd drunk,

08:14.520 --> 08:16.600
courting couples, old people,
students.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.120
Anyone else?

08:18.120 --> 08:20.440
I don't watch them
thinking there's gonna be a quiz.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.880
What about you, Mr Peckett?
I don't see much from the cab.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.160
And it was foggy.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.600
We was crawling all the way back.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.720
We didn't get back till gone two.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.000
Can anyone vouch for you?

08:31.960 --> 08:33.960
One of the mechanics
on the night shift, maybe.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.360
And whoever you've got at home,
presumably.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.960
My mother-in-law
don't sleep so good,

08:38.960 --> 08:40.560
so I took her in her tea
when I got home.

08:40.560 --> 08:42.520
What about you, Mr Grant?

08:42.520 --> 08:45.960
No fear. No little scrubber's
got a ball and chain on me yet.

08:45.960 --> 08:50.080
Well, if you run into any passengers
you recognise from last night,

08:50.080 --> 08:52.000
just point them out
to DS Strange here.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.120
He'll be travelling with you
this evening.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.680
All right.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.120
All right.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.480
What do you make to them?
The driver seems decent enough.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.200
I wouldn't give you two bob
for Quasimodo.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.760
No, me, neither.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.800
Show Stanton's face around
to as many passengers as you can,

09:11.800 --> 09:13.680
see if it jogs any memories.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.680
He was on that bus long enough.
Somebody will have seen him.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.560
Excuse me, gentlemen...

09:19.560 --> 09:22.680
Are either of you a DCI Thursday
from Castle Gate Police Station?

09:22.680 --> 09:24.760
Yeah, that's me.
There's a phone call for you.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.360
DCI Thursday.
BRIGHT: 'Ah, Thursday.'

09:34.360 --> 09:36.360
The Control Room
did try to reach you in the car.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.560
Your wife telephoned.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.800
Asked if you could drop by home.
'She said it's of some urgency.'

09:40.800 --> 09:42.400
Thank you, sir.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.040
Win?
Front room.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.320
What's going on?
He's not been hurt,

10:14.320 --> 10:16.280
that's the first thing to say.
That we know of.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.800
What do you mean?

10:17.800 --> 10:19.280
It's Sam.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.360
A man called,
a Captain Stanhope from his unit,

10:22.360 --> 10:24.080
his regiment over there.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.840
I wrote it all down.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.520
He wants to know
if we've heard from him.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.840
He's missing?
Absent without leave,

10:29.840 --> 10:31.160
his officer said.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.120
He had an afternoon pass yesterday,
apparently,

10:34.120 --> 10:36.000
and he didn't return to barracks.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.720
They don't know where he is.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.640
Hello, matey.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.720
I wasn't sure we'd see you today.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.600
Feeling better?
Yeah, much.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.840
Where's, er...?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.560
The old man?
Mm-hm.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.560
Oh, of course, you won't have heard,
will you?

11:13.560 --> 11:14.840
What?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.800
He was last seen in a city bar,
according to his CO.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.160
He may have got involved
with a local girl.

11:21.160 --> 11:23.120
A lot of the lads have, apparently.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.560
But nobody knows who she is.

11:25.560 --> 11:29.320
He might have gone AWOL over her,
but it'd be out of character.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.280
If you need to go out there...

11:31.280 --> 11:33.520
Thank you, sir, but the officer said

11:33.520 --> 11:35.520
I'd just be one more thing
for them to worry about.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.560
Well, you're to take whatever
compassionate leave you need.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.360
Mrs Thursday will want you home,
I'm sure.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.200
Win's got our Joan
looking after her, sir.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.880
I don't think she'd want me
under her feet as well.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.680
I'm better here, to be honest,
working.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.640
Whatever you think best, of course.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.720
A couple of passengers
have come forward

11:55.720 --> 11:57.920
to help us build a picture
of who else was on the bus.

11:57.920 --> 12:03.680
So far, we've got a business type
in a bowler, moustache, 40s.

12:03.680 --> 12:07.760
A girl, 20s, in a PVC mac
and white go-go boots.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.440
A drunk,
medium height, medium build,

12:10.440 --> 12:12.360
clerk type, 30s possibly.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.360
A younger man,
a student type reading a book.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.240
And an elderly woman, retired maybe.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.440
And where was the envelope?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.480
Inside the breast pocket
of his jacket.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.680
And there was nothing in it,
no letter or...?

12:24.680 --> 12:26.240
What's there is there, matey.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.680
Not much of a speller, though,
was he, for a don?

12:29.680 --> 12:31.040
Which with a "y".

12:32.080 --> 12:34.000
You're in, then. Feeling better?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.520
Oh, any news on Sam?
No. No news.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.280
So, what was the matter with you
yesterday?

12:38.280 --> 12:41.040
Ah, just something I ate.
Maybe you should get a checkup.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.520
Oh, no, no. I'm much better. Really.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.200
Well, better than this chap.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.480
What's the story with the eyes?

12:46.480 --> 12:48.920
Saw something he shouldn't have,
maybe.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.960
Any idea what he was doing
at Chipping Compton

12:50.960 --> 12:52.080
at that time of the night?

12:52.080 --> 12:53.880
No.
He has a place in North Oxford,

12:53.880 --> 12:56.080
but nobody we spoke to there
could shed any light.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.240
Well, he must have been
meeting someone.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.360
What do the bus crew say?

12:59.360 --> 13:01.000
Not much.
They didn't remember him.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.440
Right, so,
according to the crime board,

13:03.440 --> 13:05.720
the bus was back at the depot
gone two.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.560
Does that chime
with the Bundy clock? Which?

13:08.560 --> 13:11.880
Well, there'll be a Bundy clock
here at the terminus.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.400
The conductor turns it with his key
and gets his card punched.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.480
It's to prove the bus was there
when they say it was.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.840
I'd think checking that
would be a priority. Would you?

13:19.840 --> 13:22.200
Well, funnily enough,
we were a man down yesterday,

13:22.200 --> 13:25.320
which left us short-handed.
So...

13:32.320 --> 13:34.320
We did manage to make some headway,
matey.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.920
Even without you there
to oversee our efforts.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.880
We don't need someone
coming in wise after the event

13:45.880 --> 13:47.880
to mark our homework.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.120
No.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.360
I can, erm...

13:55.520 --> 13:57.520
I can go and check Stanton's rooms
at Wolsey

13:57.520 --> 13:59.600
if you think it would help.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.200
Yeah, if you like.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.080
He had a mate killed.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.680
Right beside him.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.000
A fellow from his unit.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.960
A sniper at a checkpoint.

14:14.960 --> 14:18.040
A reprisal for what happened
at Ballymurphy over the summer.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.440
Maybe that knocked him.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.240
It would knock anyone, wouldn't it,
seeing a mate go like that?

14:31.160 --> 14:33.680
Reprisals...
I thought we'd done with all that.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.000
You don't expect it, is all,
not in peacetime.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.800
It was a policing job
as much as anything,

14:39.800 --> 14:42.000
stop one lot killing another lot.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.640
We went in to keep people safe.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.920
That's why Sam was there,
to keep them safe.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.520
Now they're...

14:56.560 --> 14:58.280
I don't understand.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.000
What did you miss?
Mm?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.800
Well, besides my sparkling company
and witty repartee...

15:14.800 --> 15:17.480
It's all in the report.
Yes, yes, yes, I've read the report.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.720
But I want to hear it from you.
Not a great deal to tell.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.800
Death by exsanguination

15:22.800 --> 15:26.760
as a result of multiple stab wounds
fore and aft.

15:26.760 --> 15:30.200
Oh, and the crosses
carved on his eyes, of course.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.160
Cheers.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.400
Now, there was one curiosity.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.680
His last meal.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.800
A surfeit of mints, the
one with a hole.

15:38.800 --> 15:43.640
Presumably to mask the stink
from a bellyful of five-star brandy.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.280
Maybe he was the soak on the bus.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.760
Strange said the conductor mentioned
there was a drunk,

15:48.760 --> 15:51.720
30s, average height and build.
It could have been him.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.240
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR

16:08.400 --> 16:10.400
Morse, come in.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.160
I was just, er, passing.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.600
Have you heard?
Yeah, of course.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.080
How's, er...?

16:19.680 --> 16:21.040
And you?

16:21.040 --> 16:22.520
I don't know.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.200
It's silly, I...

16:26.200 --> 16:29.560
I always thought if something
happened, then I would know.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.000
You know, feel it...

16:31.000 --> 16:32.480
..somehow.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.640
He's always been my little brother,
you know.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.640
Like, when we were kids,
if he had a fall

16:38.640 --> 16:40.840
or was getting duffed up
in the playground,

16:40.840 --> 16:42.520
I'd know and I'd get to him.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.080
And, yeah, now I can't.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.640
Well, if you need anything.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.360
Well, if there's anything I can do.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.680
Oh, Morse.
I thought I heard someone.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.720
Ah, Mrs Thursday, I just...

17:02.720 --> 17:05.200
I just came by.
Oh, that's good of you.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.800
We're all right, thank you.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.920
We don't need checking up on.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.560
And if we did...

17:11.560 --> 17:14.880
..it's Fred who should be here
himself, not sending his men round.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.520
Mum!
Oh, no, I wasn't sent, Mrs Thursday.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.880
No.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.240
Well...

17:23.880 --> 17:26.360
She's not herself.
Oh, please, you don't...

17:28.320 --> 17:29.600
SHE SIGHS

17:30.720 --> 17:32.080
Well...

17:33.000 --> 17:34.840
..you know where I am.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.280
Morse...

17:38.280 --> 17:39.840
Keep an eye on Dad.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.880
Of course.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.600
SHE SIGHS

17:52.560 --> 17:54.160
TELEPHONE RINGS

17:54.160 --> 17:56.680
Thursday.
'It's Strange, sir.'

17:56.680 --> 17:59.600
This Bundy clock Morse
was asking about.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.200
There was an issue
due to the weather, apparently.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.280
The conductor reported
the hatch was frozen shut.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.640
On the level, do you think?
'It was a cold night.'

18:06.640 --> 18:09.800
Freezing fog and a bit of sleet
earlier in the evening.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.240
It did freeze shut,
according to the bus inspector.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.040
'And another dose set for later.'

18:14.040 --> 18:16.400
Heavy snow this time,
according to the wireless.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.600
'Yeah. I'm gonna stick on here.'

18:18.600 --> 18:21.600
Show Stanton's face around.
Right.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.280
I'll take it from here, thank you.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.520
DOOR CLOSES

20:42.640 --> 20:44.400
MORSE:
Just back from Stanton's.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.400
Er, I found a letter which matches
the envelope found on his body.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.520
There's a message on it.

20:48.520 --> 20:53.160
W-S-W-3-M-A?

20:53.160 --> 20:55.720
West south-west something, possibly?

20:57.760 --> 20:59.280
You've four weeks' leave owing.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.400
Mr Bright thinks
you should take it now. And so do I.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.880
Deal with...

21:03.880 --> 21:05.600
..whatever you need to deal with.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.480
The force has people who can help,
if you need it, places you can go.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.000
What, erm...?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.640
What do you mean, places I can go?
Sir, what are you talking about?

21:15.640 --> 21:16.840
Christ...

21:18.120 --> 21:19.640
You want me to spell it out?

21:20.800 --> 21:23.040
I told you,
the drink's a good servant,

21:23.040 --> 21:24.160
but a poor master.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.800
I picked your coat up
from where you dropped it.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.960
And this fell out of the pocket.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.160
What, a bus ticket?
Look at the route.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.240
Yes, it's...

21:36.240 --> 21:40.080
It's the 33 that I take home
from work sometimes.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.400
Look at the date.
It's two nights ago.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.640
It says you boarded
at fare stage four.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.280
That's off The Broad.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.760
Your home stop would be
Broadwood Avenue, wouldn't it?

21:49.760 --> 21:52.520
That's fare stage 19.
Mm-hm.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.240
The bottom number
gives a running total

21:54.240 --> 21:55.680
of all the tickets sold that day.

21:55.680 --> 21:58.040
Your number's 4,493.

21:58.960 --> 22:03.000
Patrick Stanton's is 4,479.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.960
He boarded at fare stage two.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.320
You were on the same bus
as the murder victim

22:07.320 --> 22:08.800
and you didn't say anything.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.040
If you hadn't been so drunk,
we'd have a credible witness.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.960
Excuse me?

22:16.960 --> 22:19.080
Yes, mate?
Did you just say Green Lane?

22:19.080 --> 22:20.880
Next stop.
I ride a motorbike, myself.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.880
Excuse me,
have we passed Broadwood Avenue?

22:22.880 --> 22:24.960
Unless the driver's
changed the route, yes, mate.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.680
THURSDAY:
You don't remember, do you?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.160
You're the drunk on the bus
that we've been looking for!

22:33.840 --> 22:35.400
You've grazed yourself.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.320
Those stairs are slippy.
I know.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.520
Bad enough in the dry.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.080
But when they're wet,
they're murder.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.280
Will you be all right?
Oh, yeah, fine. Thank you.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.200
BELL DINGS

22:50.200 --> 22:52.120
THURSDAY: My old man
was a devil for the drink.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.040
It's what did for him in the end.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.400
I'd hate to see you go the same way.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.320
You're young. You're smart.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.040
Break the habit,
before it breaks you.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.640
He was wearing cufflinks.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.360
Stanton. Erm...

23:06.360 --> 23:07.640
Silver...

23:07.640 --> 23:09.320
..cufflinks.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.920
With some kind of a number on them.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.080
Cufflinks?
Yeah, I've...

23:13.080 --> 23:14.920
I've just remembered it.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.720
There's a place down in Sussex
run by a fella called Wain.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.160
A kind of health farm.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.480
Very discrete.
He'll see you right.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.240
There's no shame in needing help.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.080
I don't need help.
As you like.

23:29.080 --> 23:30.720
But I'm signing you off
all the same.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.440
I've got enough on my plate with...

23:34.240 --> 23:36.480
Take the four weeks,
or don't come back.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.320
I can't use you in this shape.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.040
MORSE SCOFFS

23:46.880 --> 23:49.360
WIND HOWLS

23:59.960 --> 24:04.280
STRANGE: 'So far, we've got a girl,
20s, in a PVC mac

24:04.280 --> 24:06.080
'and white go-go boots.

24:13.760 --> 24:17.040
CONDUCTOR: Good evening and welcome,
ladies and gentlemen. Come aboard.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.640
That's it.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.560
Chipping Compton, is it?
Yep.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.520
I remember you from the other night.
I never forget a pretty face.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.520
Someone there to meet you, is there?
Yes, my boyfriend.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.760
Is he?

24:37.760 --> 24:39.480
Well, I hope he's got
a nice, warm car.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.840
Cos you don't want to be out there
in all that cold and snow

24:41.840 --> 24:43.880
freezing your little
you-know-what off, do you?

24:43.880 --> 24:45.680
BUS TYRES SKID

24:45.680 --> 24:47.280
LOUD BANG

24:49.520 --> 24:51.160
Is everyone all right?

24:51.160 --> 24:53.240
I think so.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.760
My head.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.960
Oh, you'd better let me
take a look at that.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.880
It's perfectly all right,
I'm a doctor. My name is Nicholls.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.560
There, now.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.040
Does anyone have a lighter?

25:05.600 --> 25:07.080
Thank you.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.280
HE GROANS
No, no, it looks worse than it is.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.480
Head wounds
always bleed very heavily.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.080
Just watch out for concussion.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.520
If you feel giddy or sick,
let me know, yes?

25:17.520 --> 25:19.320
Is anyone else hurt?
ALL: No.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.880
I've got a broken heart.
You can fix that if you like.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.320
Now, now....

25:23.320 --> 25:25.160
Everybody all right?

25:25.160 --> 25:27.280
Your conductor's
taken a bit of a knock.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.960
But everyone else
seems to be faring OK.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.440
How about the passengers downstairs?
Everybody came up for the warmth.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.760
Driver, what happened?
Black ice, sir.

25:35.760 --> 25:38.880
I tried to hold her,
but she wouldn't respond.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.280
We're stuck in a snowdrift,
and the engine's conked out.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.480
Can you fix it?

25:42.480 --> 25:44.760
I'm a driver, not a mechanic.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.360
Well, someone will have to go for
help.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.880
Volunteering, are you, squire?

25:47.880 --> 25:51.000
No, I'm not. He's the driver.
His first duty is to the passengers.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.520
My first duty is to the
Oxford & District Bus Corporation.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.040
That means this vehicle.
Well, someone will need to go.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.520
After you, then, Captain Oates!

25:57.520 --> 26:00.880
Look, arguing
isn't going to help anything. Is it?

26:00.880 --> 26:02.000
Where are we?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
The next stop would've been
for Narracott Halt,

26:04.000 --> 26:05.080
for the station there.

26:05.080 --> 26:07.400
What's that, about a mile away?
Nearer two.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.640
But you can't go out there, chief.
Not in this weather.

26:09.640 --> 26:10.800
You wouldn't get 200 yards.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.200
So, the last stop
was Tafferton Park, is that right?

26:13.200 --> 26:14.640
What of it?

26:14.640 --> 26:16.120
Well, nothing.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.120
Just we can't be far
from Tafferton Park Hotel.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.560
I used to work there as a waitress.
Tafferton Park?

26:20.560 --> 26:22.360
Didn't it close down after that...

26:22.360 --> 26:24.080
..business?
What business?

26:24.080 --> 26:27.160
The Loomis case. An escaped lunatic
gate-crashed a fancy dress do.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.160
Killed a whole load of people.
Grisly affair, as I recall.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.800
Well, there might be a phone there.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.400
After all this time, the wires
will have been cut, surely.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.240
Well, it's got to be better
than sitting here,

26:36.240 --> 26:37.400
catching our death of cold.

26:37.400 --> 26:40.240
We should stay with the bus.
Somebody'll come out.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.680
I say, put it to a vote.
We're not in Athens now.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.160
Vote all you like.

26:44.160 --> 26:47.360
But this is my bus
and I'm staying with her.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.840
And if you've all got any sense,
you'll do the same thing.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.960
STARTLED GASPS

26:52.960 --> 26:55.840
Well, I'd say
that rather settles it.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.360
WIND HOWLS

27:03.640 --> 27:05.560
MORSE: Are you sure you know the way
from here?

27:05.560 --> 27:08.320
I recognise the lamp-post.
It's not far.

27:08.320 --> 27:11.720
Here, you'd better have this.
Well, you lead, we'll follow.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.840
BRIGHT: Still here, Thursday?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.840
Thought you'd have been away
long since.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.520
Just, er...

27:24.520 --> 27:26.160
..waiting on Strange, sir.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.080
He's on the 33.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.240
Oh...

27:30.400 --> 27:31.880
Well, perhaps...

27:31.880 --> 27:34.840
Perhaps I'll wait with you.
Unless you've any objection.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.040
None, sir.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.320
But he could be some time.
The weather looks to have set in.

27:40.320 --> 27:43.240
You might be better getting home
while you can.

27:43.240 --> 27:46.040
I find there's less cause
to hurry back these days.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.800
Supper for one
and The World About Us.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.960
My table talk
was hardly scintillating

27:51.960 --> 27:54.200
when there was someone
there to hear it.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.920
Now, I imagine, it's rather less so.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.440
And certainly one-sided.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.840
I'll be glad of your company, then,
sir.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.120
I don't suppose there's any...?
Of Sam?

28:06.040 --> 28:08.160
Er, no, sir. No. Not yet.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.240
Well, that's something, perhaps.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.520
Yes, sir, that's something.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.680
WIND HOWLS

28:26.520 --> 28:28.200
We're nearly there!

28:45.760 --> 28:48.240
I told you it was a waste of time.

28:48.240 --> 28:50.680
Look, give me the torch
and I'll go round the side.

28:50.680 --> 28:51.800
Thank you.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.600
PECKETT: You see, Les?
Nobody listens to me.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.640
WIND HOWLS

29:49.560 --> 29:50.840
DOOR OPENS

29:50.840 --> 29:52.520
Come in, come in.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.640
Come on.
Well done.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.840
Strewth...
Now, there's no electricity.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.840
But do you know if there's
an emergency generator, Miss...?

30:03.840 --> 30:05.360
Travers, Linda.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.680
I think there is a generator block
among the cabins.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.920
Can you show me?
Of course, if you like.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.680
Right, I'll get a fire lit.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.360
What about the phone?

30:13.360 --> 30:15.000
That's what we've come here for,
innit?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.160
It's dead.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.920
I told you
we should've stayed with the bus.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.240
We're in the dry, that's something.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.480
There should be a box of candles
somewhere.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.000
We'd put a few out of an evening
for the guests.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.160
Mr Churchyard
said it made things cosy.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.760
Who's Mr Churchyard?
Er, he was the manager.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.000
PIANO MUSIC PLAYS

30:31.000 --> 30:33.400
Perhaps we should
introduce ourselves.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.560
I really can't see there's any call
for needless familiarity.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.600
Get you!

30:37.600 --> 30:39.440
If we're going to be here
any length of time.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.200
Hopefully, we won't be.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.800
I can't imagine we'll be
sending each other Christmas cards.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.080
Ah...

30:45.080 --> 30:46.640
It's all right, lady,
I don't mind.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.960
I have manners,
even if others ain't.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.680
Norbert Hobbs.
But my friends, they call me Nobby.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.480
Mrs Bruce-Potter.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.400
Post Mistress, retired.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.440
And what do you do?
It's like the Queen Mum.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.960
POSH ACCENT:
And what do you do?

30:58.960 --> 31:02.000
A bit of this, a bit of that.
Jack of all trades, you might say.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.240
What a man of mystery you are,
Mr Hobbs.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.400
I'm Richard Blake.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.320
My friends call me Richie.
I'm a student.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.640
Mrs Watson, Elsie.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.360
Percy Walsh. I'm also retired.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.680
Previously with the Exam Board.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.760
Linda Travers, shop assistant.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.080
I'm John Peckett.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.320
And this is my conductor, Les.

31:23.320 --> 31:26.240
Very well, if you must know,
my name is Yeager.

31:26.240 --> 31:29.000
Lawrence Yeager.
And I'm a solicitor.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.680
Morse.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.320
Just Morse?

31:32.320 --> 31:34.040
That's right.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.520
It's settling.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.080
They said it would.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.640
He'll come home, Mum.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.840
Oh, I know he will.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.200
I know.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.760
There should be more in the stores.

32:12.760 --> 32:15.800
I can have a look, if you like.
I'll come with you.

32:15.800 --> 32:18.680
There might be some painkillers
that I can give to our conductor.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.960
Or we can go together in a moment.

32:20.960 --> 32:24.080
Then Miss Travers might show us
where the generator block is.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.240
So, this is where it all happened.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.680
All what happened?
The massacre. The Loomis boy.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.040
Oh, I've never heard of him.
Posh boy, wasn't he?

32:32.040 --> 32:34.200
Some private school or other.
He went off his head

32:34.200 --> 32:35.840
and tried to do
for one of the teachers.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.200
So he put them away.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.360
Yeah, Strangmoor he ended up,
Headington Hill.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.080
A year later,
Loomis and another prisoner

32:41.080 --> 32:43.480
escaped from a van taking them
back to hospital from court.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.480
Loomis made his way here,
killed one of the guests

32:45.480 --> 32:47.280
and went round
in the dead man's fancy dress,

32:47.280 --> 32:49.360
murdering anyone that took his eye.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.880
You seem to know a lot about it.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.960
Well, I read a book on it
by a fella called Fitzowen.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.360
I don't think it's something
to dwell on this evening.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.560
We've got to do something
to pass the time.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.960
Might as well be a story
round the campfire.

32:59.960 --> 33:03.280
God, my head!
Maybe you should lie down, Les, huh?

33:03.280 --> 33:05.400
What became of him, Loomis?

33:05.400 --> 33:08.440
He was caught and sent
back to Strangmoor, I believe.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.640
He was. Only, before the case
came to trial, he killed himself.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.680
That's a horrible story.

33:13.680 --> 33:16.240
And I don't know why anyone
would want to tell it here and now.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.400
Miss Travers was a waitress here,
weren't you?

33:18.400 --> 33:21.000
For all we know,
it happened during her time.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.880
Right, which way's the bar?

33:23.880 --> 33:25.640
Presumably, there is one.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.680
If I might suggest we
all stay together for the moment.

33:28.680 --> 33:30.400
What, in case the bogeyman gets us?

33:30.400 --> 33:32.080
HE LAUGHS

33:33.880 --> 33:35.880
Miss Travers, after you.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.160
Mind your step.

33:50.160 --> 33:53.120
When were you last here?
Oh, long time ago.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.360
I only did six months or something.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.320
If I remember, this should be it.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.720
The place is like the Marie Celeste.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.000
As if whoever was here
had just stepped out for a minute.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.440
How long did you say
it'd been closed?

34:08.440 --> 34:10.320
Erm, eight years it must be now.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.040
February '63.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.640
Is that when you were here?

34:13.640 --> 34:15.640
It's not really something
I like to talk about.

34:15.640 --> 34:17.000
No, of course not.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.120
I'm sorry.
That was thoughtless of me to ask.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.280
Here they are.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.480
There's not many left,

34:22.480 --> 34:24.680
but they should last us
if we're careful.

34:30.680 --> 34:34.000
If you give me a light...

34:36.040 --> 34:38.080
..I'll find my own way back

34:38.080 --> 34:40.400
if you want to push on
and see about the generator.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.240
Hm...

35:12.000 --> 35:14.560
WIND HOWLS

35:14.560 --> 35:16.280
Right, which way?
To the right.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.240
Bingo!

35:45.280 --> 35:47.160
Oh, lovely.

35:47.160 --> 35:49.320
LOUD NOISE

35:54.080 --> 35:55.840
HE GASPS

35:57.600 --> 35:59.840
Are you all right?
Yeah.

36:01.600 --> 36:04.360
So, have you any idea
how this thing works?

36:04.360 --> 36:06.000
Not really.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.080
Well, how difficult can it be?

36:10.240 --> 36:13.400
I'm sure she wasn't being rude,
Dr Nicholls, earlier.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.280
No, I know. It's only natural
people are curious.

36:16.280 --> 36:19.200
But they wouldn't be
if they'd been here.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.120
Yeah, I'm sure.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.720
I was 14.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.000
My mum and dad let me do
a little bit of waitressing

36:25.000 --> 36:26.320
for pocket money.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.840
We didn't really know
what was going on for a while.

36:28.840 --> 36:32.120
People just disappeared.
One of the guests, a waitress.

36:32.120 --> 36:34.800
You just thought they were off
enjoying themselves somewhere.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.360
But he'd got them.
Even poor Mr Churchyard.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.320
And then the police were here and...

36:42.360 --> 36:43.720
..they got him.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.280
The place closed down that night
and never reopened.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.600
Well...

36:49.600 --> 36:50.960
..who'd want to come here?

36:53.760 --> 36:55.840
BRIGHT:
Gruesome business, Thursday.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.880
There's something about it
rings a bell, sir.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.840
But I'm damned if I know what it is.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.760
An old case, perhaps?

37:01.760 --> 37:04.160
If it is, it wasn't one of mine.
DOOR OPENS

37:04.160 --> 37:06.240
You're back early.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.720
The service has been cancelled
due to the snow.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.480
All quiet, Sergeant?
Dead as, sir.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.960
I rode the outbound 33
out to the terminus,

37:13.960 --> 37:16.760
stayed aboard,
and came all the way back again.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.640
At least the late's been cancelled.
Saved you the bother of changing.

37:19.640 --> 37:23.720
No late service, maybe.
But there was a 33 still running.

37:23.720 --> 37:24.880
Morse was on it.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.120
Morse was?

37:27.120 --> 37:29.240
He's on leave as of this afternoon.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.840
Well, he was there, sir.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.800
I don't think he saw me.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.280
I saw him.

37:34.280 --> 37:37.120
Maybe he was just catching the bus
home, like a civilian.

37:37.120 --> 37:40.120
It goes by his way, doesn't it?
It does, sir.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.920
In any event,
he's left his car in the yard.

37:44.080 --> 37:47.120
Perhaps he didn't fancy his chances
behind the wheel in this weather.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.640
And I can't say as I blame him.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.280
No, sir.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.920
Well, if all your strays
are gathered in, Thursday,

37:53.920 --> 37:56.360
I might cut along home.
Yes, sir.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.160
I'll just give the case
another pipeful.

37:58.160 --> 38:01.200
I wouldn't leave it too late, sir.
The roads are getting pretty bad.

38:01.200 --> 38:04.160
And the wireless says this is set
to go through till morning at least.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.720
Mind how you go.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.040
Do you want to give it a try?

38:23.360 --> 38:25.960
GENERATOR KICKS INTO LIFE
Ah!

38:28.480 --> 38:32.280
You were on the 33 bus, weren't you,
the night before last? So was I.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.760
Yeah, I was meeting my boyfriend
at Chipping Compton.

38:34.760 --> 38:38.040
He lives in Henley,
but he drives up to meet me halfway.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.720
Did you hear about that chap
that was found dead?

38:40.720 --> 38:43.520
It was in all the papers.
Yeah, I read about it.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.560
Did you see him on the bus?

38:45.560 --> 38:49.080
I don't know. I might have done
if I knew what he looked like.

38:49.080 --> 38:51.760
But when you got off at
Chipping Compton you didn't see him?

38:51.760 --> 38:53.120
I fell asleep.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.800
And when I woke up,
the bus was empty.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.880
It was only the conductor
shouting for "all change"

38:56.880 --> 38:58.080
that brought me round.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.360
Shall we get back to the others?
Yes, let's.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.720
HE PLAYS THE PIANO

39:10.160 --> 39:11.360
Any luck?

39:13.760 --> 39:16.160
Oh, I say, well done.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.320
Where's everyone else?

39:17.320 --> 39:19.000
The conductor
wasn't feeling very well.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.440
Bang on his head, I suppose.
So, the driver took him upstairs

he could lie down.

No, no, there's someone else.
Erm, Mr Hobbs.

39:27.160 --> 39:30.080
He went to find the bar.
Oh...

39:30.080 --> 39:32.120
So, you got the lights working,
then.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.160

Not good.

if I could pick your brains.

40:51.720 --> 40:55.200
It's about an old County case,
eight years ago.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.560
A rather disturbed young man
called Warren Loomis.

Well, there's a broken bottle
on the floor behind the bar...

42:46.600 --> 42:49.200
and fresh blood on the mirror.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.640
So, him drop a bottle.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.640
Maybe he cut himself
and went to clean up.

42:52.640 --> 42:55.360
Or maybe he thought better of
staying here and went for help.

42:55.360 --> 42:57.960
That's unlikely, I would have
thought, without his overcoat.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.880
I can help you find him,
if you're worried.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.160
No, I can manage, thank you.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.160
Please, all just try
to stay together.

43:05.160 --> 43:07.040
At least until I return.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.240
Well, he's a funny so-and-so,
isn't he?

43:14.240 --> 43:17.240
Highly-strung, I would have said.
He's a drunk.

43:17.240 --> 43:19.000
What, you couldn't smell it on him?

43:19.000 --> 43:21.680
Really, you can't go round saying
things like that about people.

43:21.680 --> 43:24.400
There was a broken bottle,
wasn't there? He's a drunkard.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.000
I'm telling you.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.320
My conductor knew him straight off.

43:28.320 --> 43:30.560
He was on the bus two nights back.

43:30.560 --> 43:34.720
Didn't even know what day of the
week it was, let alone him stop.

43:34.720 --> 43:38.080
She knows.
You must have seen him. Tell them.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.400
Oh, I don't remember, really.

43:40.400 --> 43:43.280
He took a stumble down the stairs
getting off.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.640
Any sign?

44:54.640 --> 44:56.840
Er, no.
No, not yet.

No, sir. We've had reports

who first examined him

described Creech as the most

A creature wholly without
conscience. I remember.

"The epitome of evil,"
wasn't that the phrase?

54:33.640 --> 54:36.920

That's Johnny Divine, isn't it?

55:20.440 --> 55:22.360
WOMAN SCREAMS

55:23.800 --> 55:26.040
SHE SCREAMS,
MUSIC PLAYS

55:27.400 --> 55:29.240
His eyes! His eyes!

55:29.240 --> 55:32.120
What's happened to his eyes?!
Oh, my God!

55:33.200 --> 55:35.760
GASPS AND SCREAMING

55:42.240 --> 55:44.440
You're safe here.
You're all right.

55:44.440 --> 55:46.880
It's going to be all right.
It's not all right, though, is it?

55:46.880 --> 55:49.480
What the hell are you telling her
that for?! Control yourself.

55:49.480 --> 55:52.480
Don't give me bloody orders!
You've no authority here, Mr Morse!

55:52.480 --> 55:54.960
Detective Sergeant Morse,
Thames Valley.

55:56.040 --> 55:58.840
Well, if you're a policeman, why
didn't you say anything before now?

55:58.840 --> 56:00.760
Because I was hoping
that I wouldn't have to.

56:00.760 --> 56:02.280
What is going on?

56:02.280 --> 56:04.480
Mr Hobbs has been killed.
Killed?!

56:04.480 --> 56:07.040
He's in the ballroom
with his throat cut

56:07.040 --> 56:09.600
and crosses carved into his face
where his eyes should be!

56:09.600 --> 56:10.680
His eyes!

56:10.680 --> 56:13.520
It's like what happened to Mr
Churchyard. That night with Loomis,

56:13.520 --> 56:14.560
that's what he did!

56:14.560 --> 56:18.240
Loomis is dead, though, isn't he?
He died. He killed himself.

56:18.240 --> 56:20.880
So, either there's some lunatic
creeping around the hotel

56:20.880 --> 56:23.160
that we don't know about,
or whoever did that...

56:23.160 --> 56:26.760
You can't mean it's one of us.
It stands to reason, doesn't it?

56:31.360 --> 56:32.520
I'm...

56:32.520 --> 56:34.600
I'm going to look at the generator.

56:36.160 --> 56:40.200
I suggest you all stay within sight
of each other until I return.

56:41.320 --> 56:44.680
What if something happens to you?
Why should you take the risk?

56:44.680 --> 56:47.520
He's a policeman.
It's what he's paid for, right?

56:47.520 --> 56:50.200
Yes, that's right,
it's what I'm paid for, Mr Yeager.

58:13.040 --> 58:14.520
How is she, Doctor?

58:15.880 --> 58:17.160
Out cold.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.840
She's had a terrible shock,
Mr Blake.

58:19.840 --> 58:22.320
Sleep and rest
is the best thing for her.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.560
Anybody coming with me to check
on Les?

58:26.560 --> 58:29.560
I can, if you like. No, no,
don't worry, Mrs Bruce-Potter.

58:29.560 --> 58:32.440
I should see how his head's doing.
But, erm, I'd be glad

58:32.440 --> 58:35.240
if you'd keep an eye on Miss
Travers. Of course.

58:35.240 --> 58:36.680
I'll keep you company.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.600
The three of us, then...

58:38.600 --> 58:40.080
for safety.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.880
Is he upstairs?
Yes, follow me.

58:58.200 --> 59:00.920
If you all think I'm going to sit
here waiting to be picked off

59:00.920 --> 59:03.200
by this bloody madman,
you've got another thing coming.

59:03.200 --> 59:04.800
Morse said we should stick together.

59:04.800 --> 59:07.480
I don't need anybody's permission
to defend myself.

59:07.480 --> 59:09.560
If somebody wants to come for me...

59:09.560 --> 59:11.600
they'll get more
than they bargained for.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.160
I'm going to find Sergeant Morse.

59:16.160 --> 59:17.960
Er...

59:17.960 --> 59:19.600
WIND HOWLS

59:33.840 --> 59:35.400
EXHALES HEAVILY

59:36.920 --> 59:38.600
HE EXHALES

59:55.480 --> 59:57.160
FUEL SLOSHES IN JERRYCAN

1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:17.960
You're leaving?

1:00:17.960 --> 1:00:20.840
I'll send back help.
For everyone.

1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:23.760
I'm sure none of us want to be here
any more than you, Mrs Watson.

1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:26.800
But in this weather,
you'll catch your death.

1:00:29.400 --> 1:00:31.360
I'll take my chances.

1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:33.240
I can't stay here.

1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:45.320
Right, this way.

1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:47.400
DOORKNOB RATTLES

1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:49.160
It wasn't locked
when I check on him.

1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:51.200
Les?

1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:53.600
DOORKNOB RATTLES
It's John. Open the door.

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:56.640
Maybe he's taken a turn for the
worse. You'll have to put it in.

1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:58.760
I can't do that.
It's private property.

1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:02.200
Les!

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:04.840
HE THUMPS ON THE DOOR
Can you hear me?

1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:06.480
Open the door!

1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:07.840
Thank heavens.

1:01:07.840 --> 1:01:09.760
Perhaps we should wait
for the police officer,

1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:11.840
if something's happened.

1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:13.040
I'm just a retired teacher.

1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:15.360
I don't have the authority
for something like this.

1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:18.360
Sergeant Morse should be here.

1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:45.280
JOHN: Where is everybody?!

1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:49.080
What were they doing, leaving the
girl alone? For God's sake...!

1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:50.840
Is this all of you?

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.920
Er, looks that way.

1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:54.520
Miss Travers...

1:01:55.760 --> 1:01:57.560
What's going on?
It's all right.

1:01:57.560 --> 1:01:59.480
You fell asleep.
You've had a nasty shock.

1:01:59.480 --> 1:02:02.240
I want to go home.
We need to see about Les.

1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:05.840
We just went to check on him,
but his door was locked.

1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:08.560
I could stay with her,
if you can go with Mr Peckett.

1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:11.160
No, we'll all go together.
All of us.

1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:15.280
As County pieced it together,
the first victim that night

1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:18.240
was a guest named Roland Parker,
who was found dead in his room.

1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:20.560
And it was Parker's
fancy dress outfit

1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:23.440
which Loomis put on to move freely
amongst the other guests.

1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:25.560
Where the hell has he gone?

1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:28.120
He must've gone out of the window.

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:31.440
He was in no fit shape for that,
hey, Doc? You saw the state of him.

1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:34.000
He'd had a bang on the head,
Mr Peckett. That was all.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.880
Well, something has happened.
I am telling you.

1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:38.440
DOOR SLAMS, SHE GASPS

1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:18.720
RIFLES THROUGH A DRAWER

1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:25.240
So, what do you think you're looking
at with Stanton?

1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:27.160
Someone emulating Loomis' handiwork.

1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:29.040
It's odd, though, isn't it?

1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:33.640
Of all the victims at Tafferton Park
that night...

1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:37.920
only Churchyard
had crosses carved onto his eyes.

1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:39.440
What are you thinking?

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:41.840
Could Creech have been there
with Loomis, do you think?

1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:43.200
No reply from Morse's.

1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:44.600
But according to the operator,

1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:46.600
the snow's brought down cables
all over town.

1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:50.560
Jim's going to look in on his place
to see if he's back.

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:52.080
Right.

1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:54.200
WIND HOWLS

1:03:56.440 --> 1:03:58.640
Mr Blake?
Are you all right?

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:00.360
Oh, my God!
Are you OK?

1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:01.480
Fetch the blankets!

1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:03.760
Get him by the fire,
we must get him warmed through.

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:06.000
He's frozen half to death.
Right, come on, this way.

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.800
I went to find you.

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:09.800
I lost my way.
Me?

1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:13.720
I didn't think I was gonna get back.

1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:15.240
I waved.
Didn't you see me?

1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:17.640
I saw one of you.

1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:21.240
I thought you'd come out after me.
Sit down.

1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:22.880
You didn't recognise who it was?

1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:25.880
It was just a shadow in the snow.

1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:29.280
Well, fingers crossed,
they'll find their own way back.

1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:31.560
And if not,
then we can send out a search party.

1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:33.680
Er, Dr Nicholls,
we should let him settle,

1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:35.880
then you and I go and examine
Mr Hobbs' body.

1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:37.640
All right?
Yes.

1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:40.920
Thanks for coming.
I'm not sure I've been any help.

1:04:40.920 --> 1:04:42.720
If you want to get
to the bottom of this,

1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:44.400
there's only one person left alive

1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:47.080
who knows what truly happened
at Tafferton Park.

1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:48.720
And that's Flavian Creech.

1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:50.760
Good night.
Good night.

1:05:01.320 --> 1:05:03.680
I have to see a patient
at Strangmoor Hospital.

1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:06.280
It's urgent.

1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:08.720
Who's this for?

1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:10.000
Morse?

1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:15.440
It's Sam you should be out there
looking for.

1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:18.360
That's who you should "have to",
your own.

1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:21.600
Our son. MY son!
Not somebody else's!

1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:23.320
Why aren't you over there?

1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:25.800
I'll tell you why.
Because you're a coward!

1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:27.240
That's why.

1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:29.640
If anything's happened to him...
Mum, don't say that.

1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:32.960
You keep out of this! I'll say
what I please in my own house.

1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:35.480
And I will thank you
not to take sides!

1:05:36.600 --> 1:05:40.040
I'm not one of those women at work
that you think you can talk down to.

1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:41.600
You think you know it all

1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:44.720
with your books and your courses
and your clever ideas.

1:05:44.720 --> 1:05:47.400
And where did that get you?
Leamington! Don't.

1:05:47.400 --> 1:05:48.880
Please...
What does that mean?

1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:50.200
Never mind what it means!

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:52.360
You weren't so bloody clever there,
were you?

1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:53.840
No.

1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:54.920
I'm your mother,

1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:57.720
and you will give me the respect
that I'm due!

1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:01.760
Well, go if you're going.

1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:03.920
And if you are going,
don't bother coming back,

1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:05.640
because I'm sick of the sight
of you!

1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:11.560
DOOR SLAMS

1:06:12.520 --> 1:06:13.720
She doesn't mean it.

1:06:13.720 --> 1:06:15.440
Yeah, she does.

1:06:17.080 --> 1:06:18.760
And she's right.

1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:20.480
Doing nothing.

1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:23.080
Bearing it.
That takes a different kind of guts.

1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:26.760
But I'm no good at sitting
and waiting, never have been.

1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:29.560
If I could do something
to help find Sam...

1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:31.920
Of course you would.
She knows that. We all know that.

1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:35.280
I'd tear the world down
to bring him home safe.

1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:37.120
Give it my last breath.

1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:39.680
But I can't.
There's nothing I can do. Nothing.

1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:41.000
And that...

1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:46.200
But if I can't fix the one thing...

1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:48.000
I've got to fix the other.

1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:50.760
You know how I am.

1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:55.400
Sam's always taken after your mum.

1:06:56.600 --> 1:06:59.320
Slow to anger and quick to forgive.

1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:01.960
But you and me, we're...

1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:05.680
I know.

1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:25.520
What happened out at Chipping
Compton the other night?

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:30.480
I'm not interested in any petty rule
breaking with the Bundy clock, say.

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:33.560
But if there's anything which has a
bearing on what's happening here...

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:38.640
He's got a woman.

1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:40.240
Les.

1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:44.880
Her old man works away in the week.
So...

1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:48.720
..while I'm having my break,
Les is...

1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:53.440
I turn a blind eye for him,
that is all.

1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:55.640
Mm.
How long was he gone?

1:07:57.160 --> 1:07:58.360
Half an hour.

1:07:58.360 --> 1:08:00.360
45 minutes.
Well...

1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:02.960
there's no great mystery
as to the cause of death.

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:04.800
Someone cut his throat.

1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:06.480
Most likely from behind.

1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:08.600
The injuries to his eyes,
and I'm no pathologist,

1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:10.600
but I'd say
they were inflicted postmortem.

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:11.720
What about his pockets?

1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:17.080
Well, at least we know now
what the book was about.

1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:18.920
He's not a tallyman
or a debt collector.

1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:21.600
He's an agent for Zennons
Football Pools.

1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:23.880
The street names and numbers
must have been his rounds.

1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:26.800
The address on the envelope
in his jacket pocket.

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:30.200
Isis House, Abingdon Lane.
That's a probation hostel.

1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:31.760
Perhaps he was in prison.

1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:33.280
Oh, hello...

1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:36.080
There is something else.

1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:40.440
A cufflink.
Engraved. Number 37.

1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:45.400
What about his other pocket?

1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:49.200
Oh, good heavens.

1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:51.760
22.

1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:55.520
Do you think we should cover him?
Use a tablecloth or something.

1:08:55.520 --> 1:08:56.720
Just...

1:08:56.720 --> 1:08:58.200
Just lay it over him.

1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:33.280
MORSE: Walsh...

1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:43.120
"When the hurly-burly's done..."

1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:54.720
I killed a policeman once.

1:09:56.320 --> 1:09:59.560
He came asking for a missing boy
I'd been...

1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:02.680
..enjoying.

1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:05.280
Door to door.

1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:08.200
Why do coppers call it that?

1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:12.400
Do you all secretly aspire
to be commercial travellers?

1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:15.680
Knock-knock-knocking
on suburban housewives' doors

1:10:15.680 --> 1:10:18.520
with your...
with your little sample cases...

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:23.800
..filled with shoes
or brassieres or...

1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:26.160
soap, whatever it may be.

1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:34.560
I had a sample case.

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.320
But I didn't keep
bits of vacuum cleaners in it.

1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:39.480
No.

1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:42.560
You kept bits of people in it.

1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:46.680
There's somebody just gone
up the steps.

1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:48.360
What?

1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:50.440
Didn't either of you see it?
No.

1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:55.800
FAINT JINGLING
Did you hear that?

1:10:55.800 --> 1:10:58.000
It's...
It's bells.

1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:02.960
Fetch the others.

1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:11.280
Come quick! You've got to come!
He's seen someone!

1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:13.000
Who has?
Mr Walsh.

1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:16.240
I should've gone after him,
but I don't feel so good.

1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:18.680
What did you see? I don't know.
It was Walsh that saw it.

1:11:18.680 --> 1:11:20.920
He went upstairs.
Which way did he go?

1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:22.560
Left.
He went left.

1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:34.040
That was taken yesterday morning.

1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:36.480
A man carved up
with crosses for eyes.

1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:43.360
Exactly the same as one of Warren
Loomis' victims at Tafferton Park.

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:44.840
Yeah, not just any man.

1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:47.120
Hobbs is out on parole, then, eh?

1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:48.720
Who's Hobbs?

1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:51.920
The least of them.
The least of who?

1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:56.080
All I can tell you is that
you can expect three more of them.

1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:58.600
If it hasn't happened already.

1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:01.680
I shouldn't think
they'll let the grass grow.

1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:03.880
Who wouldn't?
The furies.

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.720
Three goddesses of vengeance,
who punished uncold criminals.

1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:12.200
HE CHUCKLES

1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:14.480
Ah...

1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:16.480
..Warren.

1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:21.920
My poor, little, rich boy.
A scholarship boy is what he was.

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:25.120
I've read the case files.

1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:27.360
Loomis wasn't rich.
SCOFFS

1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:28.760
Yes, he was.

1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:31.960
Or he should have been.

1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:34.120
That's what they really
put him away for.

1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:35.680
Who did?

1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:38.360
Who him put away?
There were four of them.

1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:42.000
And Churchyard.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.560
WIND HOWLS

1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:38.160
HE GASPS
Argh!

1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:40.440
HE STRUGGLES TO SPEAK

1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:43.000
Who did this?

1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.800
Yeager, what happened?

1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:47.440
HE GAGS AND GASPS
What happened?

1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:57.320
Jim...

1:13:57.320 --> 1:13:58.880
Come in.

1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:05.000
I did try to get you on the blower,
but the lines must be down.

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.440
I went by Morse's
but the place is in darkness

1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:09.240
and he's not answering the door.

1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:12.240
I wouldn't fret.

1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:14.120
He usually lands butter side up.

1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:16.160
SHE LAUGHS

1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:19.160
So...

1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:20.800
how is everyone?

1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:22.760
And more to the point...

1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:24.320
how are you?

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:28.080
I'm...

1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:32.720
I'm sorry.

1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:36.480
I'm sorry, I'm just...
Hey...

1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:39.240
SHE STARTS TO SOB
Hey, now.

1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:40.880
I've got you.

1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:42.680
It's all right.

1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:44.440
I've got you, don't worry.

1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:46.160
SHE SOBS
There now.

1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:47.720
There, there.

1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:49.840
It'll all be all right.

1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:51.520
I've got you.

1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:01.440
Someone should see
if Sergeant Morse is all right.

1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:04.200
I'll go.
No, no. You'd better wait here.

1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:06.400
Mr Blake and Miss Travers
are in no fit state

1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:07.880
to defend themselves.

1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:10.480
And I'll be careful.
Believe me.

1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:13.720
Here...

1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:15.920
You'd better knock this back.

1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:17.840
It'll warm you right through.

1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:24.640
SHE GASPS

1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:32.160
You've got to get out of here,
now. What's going on?

1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:34.360
I don't know. It's something
do with the Loomis case.

1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:35.520
At the masquerade?

1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:38.240
No, it wasn't just a masquerade,
it was a school reunion.

1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:40.080
You think Loomis came here
seeking revenge

1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:42.320
on the boys who had bullied him?
His classmates, no.

1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:44.120
But the old boys, maybe.
Look, I don't know.

1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:46.120
But I just know
whatever Loomis started in '63,

1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:48.640
someone's come here now
to help him finish it.

1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:51.760
You were there that night
at Tafferton Park.

1:15:53.760 --> 1:15:55.360
Well...

1:15:55.360 --> 1:15:58.280
..what can I say?
Many hands make light work.

1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:02.560
What were the eyes about?
A religious thing?

1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:04.600
No, just crosses.

1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:08.520
What did you see him as, Loomis?

1:16:10.040 --> 1:16:11.680
A kind of apprentice?

1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:13.440
HE BLOWS

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:14.800
Er...

1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:18.720
..a disciple.

1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:20.760
But he didn't have the nerve for it,
did he?

1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:24.360
That's why he stopped at Churchyard.

1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:27.200
If Loomis did for Churchyard at all.

1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:30.440
Warren had a great head
for figures...

1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:34.600
..before they burned it out of him.

1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:37.440
But no stomach for...

1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:39.240
wet work.

1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:40.960
Huh?

1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:42.480
HE SCOFFS

1:16:42.480 --> 1:16:44.880
They were all at Tafferton Park
for the do.

1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:47.280
Of course they were, hm?

1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:49.960
The big night they'd all been
waiting for.

1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:53.360
Yeah, the payoff.
HE CHUCKLES

1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:54.560
So...

1:16:55.800 --> 1:16:57.920
..it fell to me
to put things right for him.

1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:04.040
The manager was easy to find
cos he was in his office, but...

1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:08.080
..I didn't know what the others
looked like and...

1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:11.160
Well, I got...

1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:13.520
..distracted.

1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:15.440
Tell me about his family.

1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:19.800
Please.

1:17:26.200 --> 1:17:32.040
The colour supplement sent a snapper
to capture "Life In The Nuthatch".

1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:33.320
HE SCOFFS

1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:38.360
Our headshrinker was very taken
with the results, as you can see.

1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:41.640
I'm not allowed into the gardens.

1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:43.920
But Warren had visitors that day.

1:17:45.400 --> 1:17:48.760
It's the picture on the right.
He had a sister.

1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:52.400
Their grandmother brought her
every weekend.

1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:55.560
I think Nanna was a bit camera shy.

1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:11.640
Is he out?

1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:19.000
Cold.

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:23.960
WIND HOWLS

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:25.680
Get to the road and just keep going.

1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:27.760
When you get to the first house
call the police.

1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:28.800
Go! Go!

1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:44.120
Stop! Stop!

1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:45.600
SHE GASPS

1:18:47.560 --> 1:18:49.280
Here, get in, get in.

1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:53.320
LES: More fares?
Any more fares?

1:18:53.320 --> 1:18:54.960
Any more fares?

1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:58.040
Move right along down inside.

1:18:58.040 --> 1:18:59.920
Each side.

1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:02.280
Next stop.

1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:05.040
That's it... All right?
Yes, please, thank you!

1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:07.360
You're safe now.
I'm a police officer.

1:19:07.360 --> 1:19:10.680
Room for one more on top.
You're safe, all right?

1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:13.200
You'd better let me tend to him.
M-M-Move along.

1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:16.360
Oh, Dr Nicholls. DCI Thursday,
Doctor. Thames Valley.

1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:17.920
It's all right.

1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:20.920
There's a woman in my car
that needs attending to as well.

1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:23.640
You wouldn't, by any chance,
have seen my sergeant?

1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:28.000
HE STRUGGLES WITH A LOCK

1:19:30.840 --> 1:19:34.200
Your concern for your friend's very,
erm... touching.

1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:36.600
But it'd help if you were
in the right safe.

1:19:36.600 --> 1:19:39.280
That's the safe
for the hotel guests.

1:19:39.280 --> 1:19:42.240
The manager's personal safe
is behind that painting there.

1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:45.840
What the hell are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.

1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:48.440
As did Yeager here.

1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:50.600
And Hobbs and Stanton.

1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:52.160
Now, my guess...

1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:54.120
is that it's something
to do with Loomis

1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:56.800
and whatever's hidden in that safe
these past eight years.

1:19:56.800 --> 1:19:57.840
What?!

1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:01.120
You can either tell me now,
or you can tell them.

1:20:02.200 --> 1:20:04.640
But I'm the only one standing here
between them doing to you

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:06.760
what they've done
to the rest of your little cabal.

1:20:06.760 --> 1:20:08.600
Oh, what little cabal?

1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:10.920
Actually, it's WYCH cabal, isn't it?

1:20:10.920 --> 1:20:12.320
W-Y-C-H.

1:20:13.320 --> 1:20:15.400
That's what was written
on the back of the envelope

1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:17.840
inviting Stanton
to Chipping Compton.

1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:20.440
I assume he thought the letter came
from you.

1:20:20.440 --> 1:20:21.720
One of who?

1:20:21.720 --> 1:20:25.240
W-Y-C-H.

1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:28.720
Walsh, Yeager, Churchyard, Hobbs.

1:20:29.760 --> 1:20:32.440
Now, considering Churchyard is dead,
that little cabal.

1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:35.640
Why would he think the invitation
came from us?

1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:37.160
The code...

1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:40.120
WSW3MA?

1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:42.000
All right, I was stumped at first.

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.640
But I saw your names
on the seating plan.

1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:46.440
"House Cawdor.

1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:48.640
"WSW3MA?"

1:20:48.640 --> 1:20:51.000
"When shall we three meet again?"

1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:53.960
For Stanton,
it was the terminus of the 33 bus.

1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:55.720
The last bus of the night.

1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:58.040
I know that because I was on it
and I saw him.

1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:06.440
Now, there are two people
still alive in this hotel

1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:08.240
who where also on the bus.

1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:11.320
LES: End of the route!
All passengers alight, please!

1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:18.240
You'll be all right a minute?

1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:20.000
Call of nature.

1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:32.480
Oh, gosh, are you all right?
HE GASPS

1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:37.600
Urgh!
Let's get him off the path.

1:21:48.840 --> 1:21:52.760
My invitation to take the 33 to
Haddonfield arrived this morning.

1:21:52.760 --> 1:21:55.240
And I thought it had come from him

1:21:55.240 --> 1:21:57.880
and that we were to speak
about Stanton's death when we met.

1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:02.720
I suppose he thought his invitation
came from you or Hobbs.

1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:06.880
But why didn't you sit by each other
on the bus?

1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:09.400
WALSH: Never acknowledge
one another in public.

1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:11.120
Those were the rules.

1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:15.440
At first, I thought it must be
some kind of macabre coincidence

1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:17.800
that we'd all ended up here
in this bloody hotel.

1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:20.040
No, I don't think
it's a coincidence.

1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:22.200
I think whoever
sent those invitations

1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:24.200
never intended for you
to get to Haddonfield.

1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:27.960
I think the hotel
was always the intended terminus.

1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:30.520
Now, look, if you want
to get out of here alive,

1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:32.320
I suggest you come with me, now.

1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:44.040
So, what is it with these cufflinks?

1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:46.320
Look, I know the who and how of it,
I just need the why of it.

1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:48.000
I don't know what you mean.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:51.200
If I've got some bargaining power,
I might be able to save your skin.

1:22:51.200 --> 1:22:53.720
Stanton had ten numbers
on a blackboard in his room.

1:22:53.720 --> 1:22:57.240
Since then, I've seen six of those
numbers on three sets of cufflinks.

1:22:57.240 --> 1:22:59.720
First, on Stanton.
Second, in Churchyard's desk.

1:22:59.720 --> 1:23:01.120
Third, in Hobbs' pockets.

1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:03.440
Presumably, the final pairs
belong to you and Yeager.

1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:05.160
So, tell me, what does it mean?
HE GASPS

1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:07.120
I thought you were a detective,
Sergeant Morse.

1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:08.640
Haven't you figured it out yet?

1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:12.120
The numbers on the cufflinks
mark each man out

1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:14.400
as a member of
the Football Pools syndicate.

1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:17.080
Er, eight from ten.
The most popular Pools bet.

1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:19.960
You put a cross on the coupon
next to the ten football fixtures

1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:22.240
and hope at least eight
result in a score draw.

1:23:22.240 --> 1:23:24.360
Five men, two numbers each.

1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:26.560
Presumably, the winning line.
Mm.

1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:28.880
There was a Pools coupon
in Stanton's room.

1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:32.280
One of the winners
was a Mr C from Oxford.

1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:33.560
Churchyard presumably.

1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:36.640
Not so fast, Walsh.
We go together.

1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:40.600
Go on, Sergeant.
You're so close.

1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:43.440
So, what Churchyard has locked in
his safe these past eight years

1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:46.200
is a cash prize from a win
on the Pools. Bravo!

1:23:46.200 --> 1:23:48.960
Only, to prevent any one person
being able to make off

1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:52.400
with all the winnings, Stanton
devised a double-blind system

1:23:52.400 --> 1:23:54.920
that broke up the combination
among the syndicate.

1:23:54.920 --> 1:23:57.680
WALSH: It could only be opened
when the five of us were together.

1:23:57.680 --> 1:24:00.200
Stanton said it was foolproof.
I'm sure it would have been,

1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:03.400
had Churchyard not been killed. What
he knew went with him to his death.

1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:06.080
Which prevented anyone else
from gaining access to the money.

1:24:06.080 --> 1:24:09.560
They might have been able to work it
out if they'd shared what they knew.

1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:13.400
But avarice breeds mistrust.

1:24:13.400 --> 1:24:16.640
Hobbs wasn't going to confide his
part while they were at liberty

1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:18.560
and he wasn't.
He was in prison?

1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:19.840
Eight years. Fraud.

1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:22.200
The rest of them
didn't know how to blow a safe

1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:25.320
without destroying its contents.
So, where did Loomis fit in to this?

1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:26.960
My grandson...

1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:29.120
was born with a gift, Sergeant.

1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:35.200
An almost supernatural ability
to see patterns in random data sets.

1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:36.840
Sets of data?
Such as what?

1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:41.360
Such as several seasons' worth
of football results.

1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:43.960
You mean, he came up with a method
of predicting the Pools?

1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:45.800
He said the numbers danced for him.

1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:48.320
He demonstrated his gift
to a schoolmaster.

1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:51.400
I thought it was a joke.

1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:53.480
I mean,
we'd been doing the Pools for years.

1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:56.920
And the idea that a boy
could have better luck...

1:24:56.920 --> 1:25:00.320
Oh, you must have thought you were
on to your own rocking horse winner.

1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:03.640
Except, it wouldn't do for a teacher
to be found out enriching himself

1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:05.440
at the expense of a pupil.

1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:07.640
Which is where Churchyard came in.

1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:10.680
He put the Pools coupon in
under his own name

1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:13.600
on behalf of the syndicate,
so that Warren wouldn't realise

1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:15.840
that he'd been betrayed
by Walsh and the rest.

1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:17.400
Or so they thought.

1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:19.400
The first we knew of any of it...

1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:25.200
..was when the school rang
to say Warren had attacked Walsh

1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:29.520
in some violent and psychotic fit
and been sent to Strangmoor.

1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:31.000
It was his word against a teacher.

1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.840
Meanwhile, the money had already
been claimed by Churchyard, so...

1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:39.680
there was no way to connect it
to Walsh or the rest of them.

1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:43.240
A year they let the money cool
in the safe, a year,

1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:45.520
waiting for the fuss to blow over.

1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:49.040
While Warren was dismissed as a
disturbed and violent fantasist.

1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:52.200
But Linda found a coded message...

1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:55.480
between Churchyard and the rest
of them in his office...

1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:57.200
pertaining to the reunion.

1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:01.880
That's when they were meant
to divvy up the spoils.

1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:04.080
Only, my brother
got to them first. So...

1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:07.760
that's why you carved crosses on
Stanton eyes and the rest of them.

1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:09.760
You were following
your brother's example.

1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:12.200
Well, I'm afraid I'm going to have
to deny you your last pair.

1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:14.440
PECKETT: We don't want to 'urt you,
Sergeant Morse.

1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:16.400
It's HIM we want.

1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:18.760
What does a bus driver have to do
with this, Mr Peckett?

1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:20.840
THURSDAY:
He was an orderly at Strangmoor.

1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:23.200
DCI Thursday, Thames Valley.

1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:26.240
I've just come from talking
to Creech there now.

1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:29.360
Warren told me his story at the
time, but I didn't believe him.

1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:32.520
After he killed himself,
it didn't sit easy with me.

1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:36.120
So I looked up the family, they
convinced me of the truth of it.

1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:38.600
I don't suppose 190,000 quid
came into it.

1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:40.160
We'd no hope of that money, sir,

1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:43.960
even though it was the family's
by right. This was about justice.

1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:47.320
Justice? But Walsh and the rest
stole from Warren.

1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:48.800
They didn't kill him.

1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:51.960
They may not have held the blade
that slashed his wrists...

1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:56.560
but they killed my grandson
just as surely as if they had.

1:26:57.800 --> 1:26:59.720
THURSDAY: So, what now?
SIRENS BLARE

1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:03.160
Still want to get away with it?
You'll have to do us all in.

1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:07.680
Right, get these three
and the costume into a Maria now!

1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:09.920
Come on! You heard the DCI.
Fall to!

1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:11.240
Get a car for this one.

1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:13.920
On what charge?!
I'll think of something.

1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:16.080
We'll need an ambulance
for Mr Blake here.

1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:17.960
YELLING

1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:22.720
Is there any news?

1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:24.200
On Sam?

1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:25.680
No, sir.

1:27:25.680 --> 1:27:26.920
No, not yet.

1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:29.960
Right.

1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:03.440
Could you, er, brief Mr Bright
this once?

1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:04.840
I...

1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:06.840
I've got to get back to the family.

1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:08.320
Yes. Yes, of course.

1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:15.480
Sir...

1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:20.080
I will take those four weeks.

1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:23.000
If the offer's still there.

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:25.640
As long as you need.

1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:29.080
HE CHUCKLES

1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:34.560
It's beginning to thaw.

1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:39.520
The sun always comes up.

1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:47.160
Just got to hold on for it
a bit longer sometimes...

1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:49.920
..is all.

1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:18.240
