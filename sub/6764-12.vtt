01:35.428 --> 01:37.953
What exactly did Brandon say?

01:38.131 --> 01:41.965
He said goodbye, he said he loved you,
and he said not to worry.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.194
But why didn't he tell you
where he was going?

01:44.370 --> 01:46.736
Because I didn't ask him.

01:47.207 --> 01:49.175
Maybe we should call the police.

01:49.342 --> 01:53.676
Mother, your son is 18 years old.
He just got done with his midterms.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.338
He just needed to get out of town
for a couple of days.

01:56.516 --> 02:00.452
- Honey, he'll probably call tonight.
- I'm sure he will.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.279
At the very least,
you know he'll be home

02:02.455 --> 02:04.616
- for Thanksgiving.
- You think so?

02:04.791 --> 02:07.589
Brandon Walsh pass up
one of his mother's turkey dinners?

02:07.760 --> 02:11.821
- I don't think so.
- Well, I hope you're right.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.165
This is just not like him.

02:18.004 --> 02:19.335
She's really worried.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.339
So am I.

02:23.176 --> 02:25.167
Yeah, so am I.

04:09.782 --> 04:10.806
Hey.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.113
Hey. Hey, stop.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.521
What? What's the matter?

04:20.827 --> 04:23.921
Sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.259
Here I thought
I was about to get lucky.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.404
Okay. I know we've all worked hard

04:38.578 --> 04:42.344
making this annual Thanksgiving visit
to the Downey House better than ever.

04:42.515 --> 04:45.109
And as for me,
it's the one KEG-Alpha tradition

04:45.285 --> 04:46.843
that I'm most proud of.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.954
- Thanks, Mike.
- You're welcome, Leslie.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.091
And on behalf of Alpha House,
we would like to say congratulations

04:52.258 --> 04:54.749
on becoming
the new KEG House president.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.724
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.231
Let's see, I spoke to Cecelia today
at Downey House,

05:00.400 --> 05:03.528
and she told me that the girls
are so excited about us coming.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.671
And she wants us all to know

05:05.838 --> 05:07.430
how much this party
really means to them.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.472
Hey, Leslie,
any cute ones this year?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.166
Keith hasn't had a date
since Halloween.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.141
That's because he has breath
like a yak.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.337
Come on, guys.

05:14.514 --> 05:17.005
I know it's easy to forget
that these girls are depending on us.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.378
Most of them are runaways.
Some of them are pregnant.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.281
And none of them
have anyone else to turn to,

05:21.454 --> 05:24.719
except for the counselors
at the Downey House and us.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.453
All right,
any other committee reports?

05:27.627 --> 05:30.425
Yeah, the Decorations Committee
should meet back here by 5

05:30.596 --> 05:32.564
so that we have time to go over there
and set up.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.461
And the turkeys will be ready
to be picked up

05:34.634 --> 05:37.603
tomorrow morning at 9 a. m.
At the University Food Services.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.136
Great. Does everybody know
what they're supposed to do?

05:40.306 --> 05:41.705
- Yep.
- Yep.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.038
- Yep.
- Okay, we're out of here.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.700
Thanks again, guys.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.438
<i>Hasta la bye-bye.</i>

05:49.248 --> 05:50.442
Hey, Sears.

05:50.616 --> 05:52.208
Last year, as I recall,
you were the guy

05:52.385 --> 05:55.252
who spent half the night in the kitchen
hitting on that little blond.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.581
Yeah, but the important thing

05:56.756 --> 05:59.486
is that I spent the other half
of the night with her in the van.

05:59.659 --> 06:03.459
- How old was she anyway?
- Old enough. You know what I mean?

06:03.629 --> 06:06.063
Yeah, John,
we all know what you mean.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.662
Was that a pledge
I just heard speaking?

06:08.835 --> 06:10.268
I didn't hear anything.

06:10.436 --> 06:14.099
Good, because where I come from,
pledges only speak when spoken to.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.766
Okay, we'll see you later.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.308
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:19.579 --> 06:23.071
John Sears has got to be the most
obnoxious creature in the world.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.240
Just stay as far away from him
as you can.

06:25.651 --> 06:29.178
I'm trying. It's just hard when
we have to work on this thing together.

06:29.355 --> 06:30.720
- Can we have sodas, please?
- Sure.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.380
Well, I'll protect you. Don't worry.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.254
- Right, you're going Houston tonight.
- No, I changed my flight.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.020
I'm not leaving
till Thanksgiving morning.

06:37.196 --> 06:39.960
- Why?
- I felt guilty.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.397
I mean, I told Leslie
I'd be on the Planning Committee.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.536
How can I not follow through
with the event?

06:45.872 --> 06:47.601
I just wish you weren't going at all.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.833
Well, I haven't seen my parents
since school started.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.477
I know. It's just the thought
of celebrating Thanksgiving

06:52.645 --> 06:56.012
with just my mom and Erin
seems a little uneventful.

06:57.984 --> 07:00.509
Well, I think I know someone
who you could invite

07:00.686 --> 07:02.813
that just might spark things up a bit.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.992
No. I don't think that Dylan
wants to spend

07:09.162 --> 07:11.027
that much time with me anymore.

07:11.197 --> 07:14.325
Kelly, he smashed a pie
in John Sears' face for you.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.298
Donna, he did not do that for me.
He did that for himself.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.098
Just ask him to dinner. What's
the worst thing that can happen?

07:20.273 --> 07:23.106
He can say no,
and I can feel worse than I already do.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.710
You'll never know how he feels
if you don't ask him.

07:26.746 --> 07:30.147
- Donna.
- Just do it, okay?

07:30.817 --> 07:32.341
Fine.

07:46.599 --> 07:49.033
- Hi.
- Hey, Kel, what are you doing?

07:49.202 --> 07:51.033
Oh, nothing.

07:51.537 --> 07:54.802
I was wondering,
what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

07:54.974 --> 07:58.705
- I don't know, the usual.
- You wanna do it with me?

07:59.212 --> 08:01.271
I'm going to Baja, Kel.

08:01.447 --> 08:04.041
- That usual.
- What can I say? The surf is up.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.118
The south swells are rolling in,
they're screaming my name.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.416
You could say that you'll stay in town
and have a Thanksgiving dinner

08:10.590 --> 08:12.251
with Erin, Jackie and me.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.922
No, thanks. I don't really like to do
that turkey-eating thing.

08:16.095 --> 08:17.653
It always makes me very sleepy.

08:17.830 --> 08:22.767
But if I were gonna eat a bird
with someone, it would be with you.

08:31.477 --> 08:33.604
- Come on, move.
- I'm thinking.

08:33.779 --> 08:36.077
I'm thinking, next time,
we play with a clock.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.943
Okay, all right.
Just give me a second here.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.847
So have you decided
about Thanksgiving?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.510
My mom's waiting on a head count.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.088
I don't know.
Are you trying to distract me?

08:45.258 --> 08:47.021
You make decisions
just like you play chess.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.685
You weigh every move.
Don't you ever just take a risk?

08:50.863 --> 08:53.058
- I went out with you, didn't I?
- So?

08:53.232 --> 08:55.257
- So?
- Come. It's not such a big deal.

08:55.434 --> 08:58.494
My family eats turkey and stuffing
just like everyone else.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.134
You're the first girl in years

09:01.307 --> 09:03.639
they're actually gonna like.
Let me show you off.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.868
I don't know why
it makes me feel so nervous.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.774
Because you're neurotic.

09:08.614 --> 09:11.606
Thanks.
That makes me feel so much better.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.481
- You're sure you wanna do that?
- Yeah.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.218
Check.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.829
I hate this game.

09:46.118 --> 09:48.143
- Howdy.
- Hi there.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.255
Looks like you got
about the last spot.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.948
We pulled in 15 minutes ago,
had to drive all the way back here.

09:53.125 --> 09:56.253
You got all that gear set up
in 15 minutes?

09:56.829 --> 09:58.729
Got it down to a science.

09:58.898 --> 10:01.492
We hit the road almost every weekend
and every holiday.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.532
And we always arrive late.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.933
- Name's Curtis.
- Hi, Curtis, I'm Brandon.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.699
- Nice to meet you, Brandon.
- Nice to meet you too.

10:09.709 --> 10:12.678
Listen, I got a few extra burgers here.
Why don't you join us for supper?

10:12.845 --> 10:16.076
- Oh, no, that's all right You go ahead.
- No, no, come on, we got plenty.

10:16.248 --> 10:19.081
Besides, I'll bet all you brought
was beef jerky and some white bread.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.048
And a can of SpaghettiOs.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.778
Do you like cheese
on your burgers?

10:22.955 --> 10:24.923
Yeah, I do, Curtis.
Thank you very much.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.525
Code of the road, I always say.

10:27.693 --> 10:30.059
- Brandon, that's my wife, Debbie.
- Hi.

10:30.229 --> 10:31.696
My kids, Joyce and Andrew.

10:31.864 --> 10:35.061
Kids, I'm gonna be needing that tray.
Bring it on over.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.664
- Where you from, Brandon?
- Los Angeles.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.566
- We were just down there last year.
- Yeah?

10:39.739 --> 10:42.333
Well, actually,
we never got out of Disneyland.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.840
The kids held us hostage.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.342
Are you guys headed over the river

10:46.512 --> 10:48.104
and through the woods
to Grandma's house?

10:48.280 --> 10:50.373
No, all the grandparents
are back in Oklahoma.

10:50.549 --> 10:52.244
We're having Thanksgiving
here in the woods.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.818
Just like the Pilgrims
and the Indians, right, kids?

10:54.987 --> 10:58.946
- Dad, you are so lame.
- I am not.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.184
You're welcome to join us
Thursday for some turkey.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.385
Well, thank you, Curtis.
That's a very nice offer,

11:03.562 --> 11:06.554
but I'm headed up to Marin County
to look up an old friend of mine.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.893
- Friend or girlfriend?
- Daddy.

11:09.068 --> 11:13.095
What? He doesn't have to answer
if he doesn't want to.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.502
It's a girlfriend, actually.

11:16.075 --> 11:19.806
Don't look at me like that.
Is it my fault he's got girl problems?

11:19.979 --> 11:22.209
Well, I wouldn't exactly say
I have girl problems.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.249
Well, you're down in L.A.,
she's up in Marin.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.943
Sounds like a problem to me.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.351
You know,
you got a point there, Curtis.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.755
- Come on, let's have a burger.
- All right.

11:45.071 --> 11:46.538
You look like you could use
some help.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.832
Not from you.

11:48.007 --> 11:50.567
- What's your problem?
- You are, John.

11:50.743 --> 11:51.767
Oh, really? Who are you,

11:51.944 --> 11:55.311
the designated spokesperson
for Miss Taylor this evening?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.850
- Just ignore him.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

12:00.019 --> 12:01.680
- Kelly, Donna.
- Hey.

12:01.854 --> 12:04.288
Hi, this is Cecelia Capitti,
the director of Downey House.

12:04.457 --> 12:08.359
And I hope I get this right,
Amy, Lateesha and Denise.

12:08.527 --> 12:10.654
- You got them all right.
- Thanks for coming, girls.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.799
Lateesha's a terrific cook, and
she'll show you around the kitchen.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.763
- Let's go do decorations.
- Decorations.

12:15.935 --> 12:18.733
And Denise will show you guys where
to put the tables and chairs, okay?

12:19.538 --> 12:23.099
- I get first dibs on that one.
- Be my guest.

12:23.576 --> 12:27.012
- How you doing, Denise? I'm John.
- Hi.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.170
Well, let me show you
where we'll be setting up at.

12:29.348 --> 12:32.181
Great. Sanders, why don't you give
Keith a hand with tables and chairs?

12:32.351 --> 12:34.080
- Sure.
- Lead on.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.686
This way.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.386
So how come you're here?

12:47.032 --> 12:49.057
Well, my parents are crazy.

12:49.235 --> 12:52.932
My parents are crazy too.
Runs in the family.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.473
I just couldn't stay there anymore.

12:57.643 --> 13:00.043
- How long have you been here?
- About a month.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.581
It's kind of a drag.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.446
Beats living on the streets.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.115
It must be real scary out there.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.782
A pretty girl like you
being all by yourself.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.686
Did I say something wrong?

13:18.697 --> 13:22.633
It's just that it's been a long time
since anyone said I was...

13:23.035 --> 13:24.229
You know.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.303
I just call them like I see them.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.634
From the moment I met you, I knew
you were so much more together

13:29.809 --> 13:31.970
than any of your friends.

13:32.545 --> 13:36.811
- Thanks. I'm trying.
- So am I.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.784
Can I do something for you,
Sanders?

13:50.796 --> 13:52.263
- Good night, kids.
- Good night, Dad.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.296
Good night, guys.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.861
- Want some more coffee?
- No, thanks.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.095
That was a great dinner, Curtis.
Thank you very much.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.136
Burgers always taste better
with fresh air.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.605
Yup, that they do.

14:04.443 --> 14:05.467
So, what is it?

14:05.644 --> 14:08.704
You running after a memory
or coming to your senses?

14:08.881 --> 14:11.679
- What?
- This girl you're looking up in Marin.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.876
She must be something
mighty special.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.112
Yeah, she really is.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.448
I'll put it to you this way. When I left
L.A., I didn't know where I was going.

14:21.627 --> 14:24.323
And then I thought I saw her
in her car.

14:24.496 --> 14:28.728
And I suddenly knew
that I had to see her, after two years.

14:30.402 --> 14:33.303
Sounds like you didn't end up
on very good terms.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.804
You could say that.
Things started out great, though.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.842
I mean, Emily and I got real tight
real fast.

14:39.011 --> 14:46.417
And then she got real crazy with drugs,
and just kind of got real crazy.

14:46.585 --> 14:49.577
She kind of flipped out
and ended up in a hospital.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.547
I lost touch with her.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.558
- You never went to visit her?
- I went there one time.

14:56.262 --> 14:59.459
- It was the last time I saw her.
- Why didn't you ever go back?

15:01.100 --> 15:02.692
I don't know.

15:03.168 --> 15:06.899
A little scared, maybe.
Maybe I felt a little guilty.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.800
So she does know
you're coming to see her, huh?

15:13.078 --> 15:16.013
I don't even know
if she's gonna wanna talk to me.

15:16.181 --> 15:19.173
But I found her parents' address
in Marin, so that's a start.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.219
Well, all I can say is good luck, kid.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.191
Thanks. I think I'm gonna need it.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.099
- Hey, what brings you here?
- I came to pick up a check.

15:45.477 --> 15:47.638
No problem, I'll get my checkbook.
How much do you need?

15:49.281 --> 15:51.215
- You wanna come in?
- Okay.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.111
- Dad, Dylan's here.
- Be right down, honey.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.220
Mom made some killer lasagna.
You want some?

15:56.388 --> 15:58.982
Yeah, it's the best offer
I've had all day.

15:59.925 --> 16:02.291
- Guess what.
- What?

16:02.461 --> 16:06.955
- I got cast in a campus play.
- Well, congratulations. Big part?

16:07.132 --> 16:09.362
Yeah.
I mean, it's practically the lead.

16:09.535 --> 16:12.299
Rehearsal's start Monday,
right after Thanksgiving break.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.302
And you know
who the writer-director is?

16:14.473 --> 16:15.804
Neil Simon?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.944
No.
Pablo, the guy from our poetry class.

16:19.378 --> 16:24.247
- Weird guy, always dresses in black?
- Yeah. He is fabulously creative.

16:24.416 --> 16:26.247
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean it.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.283
And his play is very profound.

16:28.454 --> 16:31.218
Oh, yeah, yeah. Pablo strikes me
as a very profound kind of guy,

16:31.390 --> 16:35.554
the way he falls asleep in a
profound way during class, you know.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.593
You know, make fun of him
all you want,

16:37.763 --> 16:39.321
but he is very, very talented.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.432
- So is your mother.
- Dylan.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.864
No, I mean it. The woman
ought to open a restaurant, Bren.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.367
This is fabulous.

16:45.537 --> 16:47.630
Well, then you should come by
for Thanksgiving turkey.

16:47.806 --> 16:50.001
American cuisine
is definitely her specialty.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.303
I don't know. I was kind of planning
on going to Baja.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.913
Dylan, you always say that
and you always wind up here.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.515
You're right.
I'm a sucker for the food.

16:58.984 --> 17:00.110
Then you'll come?

17:00.285 --> 17:03.379
Sure, why not?
Baja will still be there Friday.

17:03.555 --> 17:05.250
- Oh, hi, Dylan.
- Hi.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.790
I just invited Dylan over
for Thanksgiving tomorrow,

17:07.960 --> 17:09.086
if that's all right with you.

17:09.261 --> 17:12.127
- I was just about to invite him myself.
- Thanks.

17:12.297 --> 17:14.857
We have room to invite
a few more people if you want,

17:15.034 --> 17:18.231
especially since it appears
Brandon won't be joining us.

17:18.404 --> 17:21.031
- Where's Brandon?
- That's what I'd like to know.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.230
He went camping.

17:22.407 --> 17:25.241
We think he went camping,
but we don't actually know for sure,

17:25.411 --> 17:27.071
because he hasn't bothered
to check in yet.

17:27.246 --> 17:31.580
- Mom, he's fine, okay?
- Well, I'm glad you think so.

17:36.422 --> 17:37.514
Where did he go, Bren?

17:38.257 --> 17:41.488
I don't know.
I am definitely not my brother's keeper.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.901
Yes? Can I help you?

18:58.070 --> 19:00.538
- I hope so. Are you Mrs. Valentine?
- Oh, no, no.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.503
The Valentines
don't live here anymore.

19:03.775 --> 19:06.437
Oh, would you happen to know
where I can find them?

19:07.212 --> 19:10.545
They moved to Athens
about five months ago.

19:11.016 --> 19:13.678
Athens, that's just on the other side
of the bay, right?

19:13.852 --> 19:15.877
No, it's in Greece.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.851
Did they leave
a forwarding address?

19:21.560 --> 19:25.496
Maybe the post office has something.
We're renting through a broker.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.962
So you wouldn't know
if their daughter went with them, huh?

19:28.133 --> 19:29.464
Sorry.

19:30.469 --> 19:31.800
Okay, thanks.

19:38.043 --> 19:39.567
Thanks for helping us, Andrea.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.543
I might not have joined the sorority,
but Downey House is a great cause.

19:42.714 --> 19:45.774
- I'm quite glad we could help.
- It should be fun tonight.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.215
Yeah, except John's gonna be there.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.685
He turned out to be
kind of scuzzy, huh?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.620
I'm so happy to be away from him
I can't even tell you.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.818
Yesterday, he was completely
hitting on this girl from the program.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.156
I mean, she couldn't have been
more than 15 years old.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.798
Thinking about it
gives me the creeps.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.900
You guys should tell the counselors
about him.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.899
Well, technically,
he didn't do anything wrong.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.300
They tell us we're supposed
to be friendly with the kids.

20:07.472 --> 20:09.804
Yeah, well, you should keep
an eye on him.

20:09.975 --> 20:10.999
I plan to.

20:12.344 --> 20:15.142
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, David, your dad called.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.179
He said that dinner's at 7
and not to be late,

20:17.349 --> 20:20.648
because Nina is attempting to cook
her first Thanksgiving turkey.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.548
Oh, goodie. I can't wait.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.087
Well, I'm sure it's better
than my mother's cooking.

20:25.257 --> 20:26.918
Well, you can come
to Houston with me.

20:27.092 --> 20:30.118
Actually, I wish
I could just go to McDonald's.

20:33.699 --> 20:35.360
You know, you guys,

20:35.534 --> 20:39.026
I don't know why I am so nervous
about going to Dan's for Thanksgiving.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.399
Could it be that you're in love?

20:42.307 --> 20:43.501
I don't think so.

20:43.675 --> 20:46.542
Or maybe it's a sign
that he's in love with you.

20:46.712 --> 20:48.509
That sounds more like it.

20:48.680 --> 20:52.514
I think he's really built me up to his
parents and this is, like, my final test.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.276
- So don't go.
- I can't do that.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.387
He's a nice guy, he means well.

20:56.555 --> 20:59.183
Plus, he already told his parents
that I'm coming.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.553
Well, Andrea, it sounds to me
like you've made your bed

21:01.727 --> 21:04.059
and now it's time to sleep in it.

21:04.696 --> 21:08.427
Yeah, well, I'm just not so sure
I wanna sleep in it with Dan anymore.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.268
You slept with Dan Rubin?

21:20.112 --> 21:21.807
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Kel.</i>

21:21.980 --> 21:25.143
Listen, my mom
just got off the phone with your mom,

21:25.317 --> 21:28.912
and she heard that you guys were
having Thanksgiving dinner alone.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.954
So my mom invited you guys
to eat with us tomorrow.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.115
That's great.
What time should we be there?

21:34.293 --> 21:36.488
Why don't you come early?
We'll hang out in the kitchen,

21:36.662 --> 21:38.459
the guys can do the football thing.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.359
Oh, cool, thanks.
Okay, I'll see you then.

21:40.532 --> 21:41.829
<i>All right, adiós.</i>

21:42.000 --> 21:45.561
Bren, do you think
I could bring David?

21:45.737 --> 21:47.932
Are you kidding? The more mouths
Cindy has to feed,

21:48.106 --> 21:49.471
the happier she gets.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.973
Great.
Tell her thanks, and thank you.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.341
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Oh, it is now. Bye.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.641
I just wrangled you an invitation to
the Walshes' for Thanksgiving dinner.

22:00.819 --> 22:04.016
- Now you don't have to go to Mel's.
- Thank you, Kel. I owe you one.

22:04.690 --> 22:05.918
Yes, you do.

22:07.259 --> 22:11.093
- Can't I go with you guys?
- No, I'm sorry.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.231
You have to make nice
with Mr. And Mrs. Rubin.

22:13.398 --> 22:16.629
- Dr. And Mrs. Rubin.
- Oh, sorry.

22:22.207 --> 22:24.835
<i>- Hello?
- Guess who.</i>

22:25.010 --> 22:26.534
Brandon.

22:26.712 --> 22:30.011
That's right, Cindy.
The correct answer was Brandon.

22:30.182 --> 22:34.414
- Tell her what she's won, Don Pardo.
- I have been so worried about you.

22:34.586 --> 22:36.486
Didn't Brenda tell you
I was gonna go camping?

22:36.655 --> 22:39.818
Well, yes, and she also told us
you were going to call us.

22:39.991 --> 22:41.549
What do you think
I'm doing right now?

22:41.727 --> 22:44.787
<i>- Don't be so glib.
- Sorry.</i>

22:44.963 --> 22:48.399
<i>- Well, where are you?
- I'm in San Francisco.</i>

22:48.567 --> 22:50.467
You went camping
in San Francisco?

22:50.635 --> 22:54.537
<i>Well, I started out in Big Sur
and I ended up in San Francisco.</i>

22:54.706 --> 22:56.230
Are you having a good time?

22:56.408 --> 22:57.932
Yeah, San Francisco
is a beautiful city.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.271
And I met some pretty cool people
on the road.

23:00.445 --> 23:01.878
<i>Well, when are you coming home?</i>

23:02.047 --> 23:04.106
Don't worry,
I'll be home in time for turkey.

23:04.282 --> 23:08.150
- I can't wait to see you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.720
<i>- Drive safely.
- Yeah, I will.</i>

23:10.889 --> 23:13.221
- Say hi to Brenda and Dad for me.
- I will.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.792
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye, honey.</i>

24:16.321 --> 24:17.845
Excuse me.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.596
Brandon.

24:26.097 --> 24:29.225
- Emily?
- What are you doing here?

24:29.401 --> 24:32.370
- It's really you, isn't it?
- In the flesh.

24:34.906 --> 24:36.498
Well, it looks
like you missed your stop.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.667
Yeah, I guess I did.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.932
I still can't believe
you're in San Francisco.

25:01.099 --> 25:04.830
- What are you doing here?
- Well, actually, I was looking for you.

25:05.003 --> 25:08.268
No, really.
I know it sounds absurd, but I was.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.738
- Really?
- Actually, it didn't start out that way.

25:10.909 --> 25:13.104
I just want to get out of L.A.
For a few days.

25:13.278 --> 25:16.076
Then I saw this girl on the freeway,
who might be your long-lost sister,

25:16.248 --> 25:17.613
and I realized I wanted to see you.

25:17.782 --> 25:20.478
- So I drove to your parent's house.
- They're in Greece.

25:20.652 --> 25:23.280
That's what the woman
who lived there told me.

25:23.455 --> 25:26.788
And then I thought it was hopeless,
and then I saw you on the cable car.

25:26.958 --> 25:30.655
- And here I am.
- Yeah, here you are.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.440
Here you guys go.

25:53.818 --> 25:56.252
- I'm so sorry.
- She's sorry.

25:56.421 --> 25:58.616
Does anybody want any more
dark meat? It's going fast.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.724
Over here, Sanders.

26:02.527 --> 26:04.119
Excuse me.

26:05.797 --> 26:08.527
Oh, excuse me, everybody.
Excuse me.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.191
Before you dig in,
don't forget to look under your plates,

26:11.369 --> 26:12.802
where you will find a raffle ticket.

26:12.971 --> 26:15.997
We'll be having a drawing for
all sorts of goodies and booby prizes

26:16.174 --> 26:19.075
right after dinner. So enjoy.

26:21.346 --> 26:24.907
After I go through the trouble of getting
you meat, you're not gonna eat it?

26:25.083 --> 26:28.416
- I'm not really that hungry.
- Me neither.

26:30.655 --> 26:32.282
You feel like getting some fresh air?

26:32.958 --> 26:34.926
I'd love to.

26:35.193 --> 26:38.526
But you can't just get up
and walk out.

26:38.697 --> 26:42.133
Sure we can.
We just can't be too obvious about it.

26:54.813 --> 26:58.442
- Where is he going with her?
- I don't know, but I don't like it.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.107
Donna, want some more dark meat?

27:00.285 --> 27:02.515
Steve, what the hell is John doing
with that girl?

27:03.188 --> 27:05.122
- Where?
- Outside.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.349
Steve, she's only 15 years old.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.121
Well, what do you want me to do?

27:09.294 --> 27:12.627
Just go outside and make sure
he doesn't do anything with her.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.337
What do you think he's telling him?

27:22.507 --> 27:25.169
I don't know,
but Mike doesn't look very happy.

27:29.748 --> 27:34.276
- Look at the moon, it's beautiful.
- Yeah.

27:34.786 --> 27:36.447
You're so much more
intuitive and sensitive

27:36.621 --> 27:39.419
than most of the girls
that I meet in college.

27:40.358 --> 27:42.155
I am?

27:42.594 --> 27:44.824
Do you know what it takes
to accomplish what you have?

27:45.363 --> 27:48.161
To have the guts to venture out
on your own and be your own person?

27:51.403 --> 27:53.667
You're the nicest guy.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.396
John.

27:56.041 --> 27:58.202
- What is it, Sanders?
- I hate to tell you this, buddy,

27:58.376 --> 28:00.708
but Ryan wants you
to go back to the house.

28:00.879 --> 28:02.972
- Why?
- When the president talks, I listen.

28:03.648 --> 28:05.115
He said we forgot the plaque

28:05.283 --> 28:07.444
and he wants you to drive back
and get it.

28:07.852 --> 28:10.047
I'll tell you what,
why don't you go get it for me?

28:10.221 --> 28:12.621
Well, I'd love to, but I'm on KP duty.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.521
You're a pledge, Sanders.
That's what pledges are for.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.389
Ryan says
he left the plaque in his room

28:17.562 --> 28:20.258
and he doesn't want a pledge
going through his stuff.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.263
And he said to hurry.

28:23.668 --> 28:25.932
Look, I'm really sorry.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

28:26.104 --> 28:28.095
- That's okay, I'll be fine.
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

28:28.273 --> 28:30.241
Come on,
let's get some pumpkin pie.

28:34.879 --> 28:37.347
Did you ever have
one of those Speak & Spell things

28:37.515 --> 28:39.540
where the turkey speaks?

28:39.718 --> 28:40.742
- Okay.
- Thank you.

28:40.919 --> 28:42.386
Bye-bye.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.817
- Mission accomplished.
- Thank you, Steve.

28:47.992 --> 28:49.653
Hey,
I'm a regular knight in shining armor.

28:49.828 --> 28:53.559
- Yes, you are.
- Kelly, quit it.

29:01.306 --> 29:02.796
Here we are.

29:02.974 --> 29:07.468
Hey. This is a great place.
How long have you been here?

29:07.645 --> 29:12.014
Since my parents moved.
Having your own place is awesome.

29:12.183 --> 29:14.276
I wouldn't know.

29:14.452 --> 29:17.046
Are you still living
with Jim and Cindy?

29:17.222 --> 29:19.156
And Brenda.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.250
Well, take your coat off, sit.
You want some tea?

29:23.428 --> 29:25.225
Yeah, please.

29:26.731 --> 29:30.497
Do you want chamomile
or lemon zinger?

29:30.935 --> 29:33.096
I'll try the zinger.

29:33.605 --> 29:37.905
So California University, huh?
How's that going?

29:38.076 --> 29:39.805
Ask me again after finals.

29:41.012 --> 29:45.005
It's going okay. I'm doing pretty good.
What about you? You still in school?

29:45.984 --> 29:49.920
I was, but I took a little time off

29:50.088 --> 29:51.953
to figure out
what I wanna do with my life.

29:56.728 --> 29:59.629
- So.
- So.

30:00.031 --> 30:01.760
Brandon.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.293
How long has it been?

30:04.169 --> 30:07.696
I'll tell you exactly.
It will be two years this Christmas.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.165
I must have really
freaked you out, huh?

30:11.342 --> 30:15.039
- No, not really.
- Come on, I freaked myself out.

30:15.213 --> 30:18.705
I mean, I practically
burned your parents' house down.

30:19.284 --> 30:24.813
Yeah, I remember you in the backyard
sitting on that float with your lighter.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.957
Fire, fire, fire.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.116
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

30:29.794 --> 30:31.159
You seem a lot better now.

30:33.031 --> 30:36.626
Yeah, well,
I stopped playing with matches.

30:37.502 --> 30:41.131
You know, this is really strange.
When I left home a few days ago,

30:41.306 --> 30:44.332
I found a picture of you
in the bottom of one of my drawers.

30:44.509 --> 30:48.275
And now, here I am looking at you.

31:00.491 --> 31:02.425
I better get that.

31:04.796 --> 31:05.820
I better get that.

31:05.997 --> 31:08.989
Hey, Em, you know, your tea kettle's
whistling. You mind if I get a cup?

31:09.167 --> 31:10.327
Well, who's this?

31:10.902 --> 31:14.463
Brandon Walsh,
Rosie O'Toole, my neighbor.

31:14.939 --> 31:17.032
The Brandon Walsh?

31:17.208 --> 31:20.200
Yes, the Brandon Walsh.
And you shut up and get your tea.

31:20.378 --> 31:24.542
Okay, okay. I didn't say anything.

31:26.417 --> 31:29.682
So, Brandon, staying for turkey?

31:30.321 --> 31:33.381
Well, actually, Rosie,
I haven't been invited.

31:33.558 --> 31:34.957
Well, of course you're invited.

31:36.995 --> 31:38.428
Cool, then I'll stay.

31:40.965 --> 31:44.560
You know, if you wanna take a shower
or change your clothes or something,

31:44.736 --> 31:47.296
- you know, feel free.
- Okay.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.973
You know,
my bags are down in my car

31:57.148 --> 32:00.242
and I'm gonna go get them now.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.747
Why don't you?

32:08.526 --> 32:11.086
Seems like we're gonna be having
a lot more than just turkey

32:11.262 --> 32:13.822
for Thanksgiving, aren't we, Em?

32:13.998 --> 32:17.798
- Rosie...
- And I see we've started packing.

32:17.969 --> 32:19.834
Well, you really have it together.

32:20.004 --> 32:24.134
You're leaving in a week
and I don't see a suitcase or a box.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.072
I know, I know. I'll do it.

32:26.244 --> 32:29.077
You're damn right you're gonna do it
because I'll make you do it.

32:29.247 --> 32:30.805
- Rosie.
- What?

32:30.982 --> 32:33.815
Don't say anything to him, okay?
I wanna tell him.

32:33.985 --> 32:37.148
Have it your way.
Emily always knows best.

32:37.555 --> 32:40.080
I told you
how in love with this guy I was.

32:40.258 --> 32:44.024
And now here he is out of the blue.
What am I supposed to do?

32:44.195 --> 32:49.963
Hey, like I said,
Emily always knows best. See you.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.471
All right. It is now time to present
this year's plaque

32:59.644 --> 33:02.340
to the young woman
who has worked the hardest

33:02.513 --> 33:06.381
to fulfill the mandates
of the Downey House charter.

33:07.218 --> 33:11.154
And this year's winner
is Sonia Martinez.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.584
All right, Sonia.

33:19.530 --> 33:21.725
Mind telling me what
that wild-goose chase was about?

33:21.899 --> 33:23.161
I'm sorry. Right after you left,

33:23.334 --> 33:26.030
the plaque turned up
on the floor of my car.

33:26.204 --> 33:28.138
Yeah, I bet it did.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.715
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Mom, it's me again.</i>

33:43.888 --> 33:47.449
- Oh, hi, honey. Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

33:47.625 --> 33:51.288
I'm just calling to tell you I won't
be home for Thanksgiving after all.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.556
Why not?

33:55.733 --> 33:59.328
Well,
I ran into an old friend up here.

33:59.504 --> 34:02.337
<i>- Who's that?
- Emily Valentine.</i>

34:02.507 --> 34:04.975
<i>- Oh, you're kidding.
- No.</i>

34:05.143 --> 34:07.611
I was there riding on a cable car,
looked up and there she was.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.610
Can you believe it?

34:10.313 --> 34:12.179
<i>- How is she doing?
- She's fine.</i>

34:12.350 --> 34:17.117
She's happy, she's healthy.
Her hair's all one color now.

34:17.288 --> 34:20.621
So you're having Thanksgiving dinner
with her?

34:20.792 --> 34:23.761
<i>- Yeah.
- Well, we'll miss you.</i>

34:23.928 --> 34:25.953
<i>- When are you coming home?
- I don't know.</i>

34:26.130 --> 34:29.793
<i>- We've got a lot of catching up to do.
- Okay.</i>

34:29.967 --> 34:33.562
- Give her our best.
- Sure will. Bye.

34:35.540 --> 34:38.407
Your parents must think
I'm a total lunatic.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.873
No, they don't.

34:41.379 --> 34:43.404
Yeah, they do.

34:44.114 --> 34:48.051
- Yeah, they do.
- They do. Oh, God.

34:48.219 --> 34:49.982
Emily Valentine?

34:50.154 --> 34:52.918
- I hope he brought his extinguisher.
- Dad.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.786
I didn't know the two of them
were in touch.

34:54.958 --> 34:58.588
Neither did I, but Brandon does keep
a picture of her in his drawer.

34:58.763 --> 35:02.164
- Yes. I knew that.
- You did?

35:02.333 --> 35:05.734
Still, I didn't think he'd actually
get in touch with her again.

35:05.903 --> 35:09.202
Well, Emily wasn't a bad kid,
just a little mixed-up.

35:09.373 --> 35:10.670
A little mixed-up?

35:10.842 --> 35:13.834
- Mom, people can change, you know.
- Maybe.

35:14.011 --> 35:18.744
But she already broke his heart once.
I'd just hate to see it happen again.

35:31.362 --> 35:33.387
- Hey, guys.
- Something's smells good.

35:33.564 --> 35:34.861
Mom's been in hog heaven all day.

35:35.032 --> 35:37.523
- These are for her.
- Oh, they're beautiful.

35:37.702 --> 35:39.363
Look who's here.

35:39.537 --> 35:43.997
- Hey, sweetie.
- You look so pretty in your little dress.

35:45.676 --> 35:49.407
- Hi, David. How are you doing?
- Good. How about you?

35:49.580 --> 35:52.105
Happy I'm not the point person
in the kitchen today.

35:52.283 --> 35:54.581
Well, I think we're all pretty happy
about that, Mom.

35:56.154 --> 36:00.022
- It's good to see you, David.
- Yeah, you too.

36:01.459 --> 36:04.155
- Hello, everyone.
- Oh, the beachcombers are here.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.818
Mom, Kelly and David
brought you these.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.864
- Oh, they're lovely, thank you.
- You're welcome.

36:09.033 --> 36:10.625
And we're just about to start carving.

36:10.801 --> 36:13.065
- Is everybody here?
- Everyone except Brandon.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.899
- Mom.
- Just had to get that off my chest.

36:16.073 --> 36:18.974
- You're allowed.
- Thank you.

36:21.812 --> 36:23.541
Perfect timing.
We're just about to sit down.

36:23.714 --> 36:27.980
- Well, these are for you.
- Oh, thank you, Dylan.

36:28.686 --> 36:31.849
- Well, shall we?
- Come on, everyone.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.048
Looks like we shop
at the same florist.

36:34.225 --> 36:36.159
Yeah, you've got good taste, Silver.

36:36.661 --> 36:40.188
- Well, actually, Kelly picked them out.
- Well, then, Kelly's got good taste.

36:40.364 --> 36:41.831
Except in boyfriends.

36:42.833 --> 36:43.857
So how was Mexico?

36:44.035 --> 36:46.003
I don't hear any south swells
calling your name

36:46.170 --> 36:48.161
from the Walsh dining room.

36:52.643 --> 36:55.874
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

37:04.622 --> 37:08.023
Watch this. School's in.

37:11.262 --> 37:13.321
Take a hike, pledge.

37:14.699 --> 37:16.291
We're playing a game here, John.

37:16.467 --> 37:18.799
I guess you didn't hear me.
I said get out.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.871
Do it, Steve.
The brother told you to leave.

37:23.641 --> 37:25.108
Fine.

37:25.943 --> 37:30.141
- Fine, sir.
- What is this all about, huh?

37:30.615 --> 37:33.550
You may be a legacy, Sanders,
but I don't care who your father was.

37:33.718 --> 37:35.015
You're a pledge. There are rules.

37:35.186 --> 37:38.087
So you're gonna follow those rules
or you're thrown out, is that clear?

37:38.256 --> 37:39.280
Yeah.

37:39.457 --> 37:42.483
- Excuse me?
- Yes, sir.

37:44.795 --> 37:47.457
Oh, yeah, one more thing, Sanders.

37:47.632 --> 37:50.726
Did you have anything to do with
that stunt with the plaque last night?

37:51.335 --> 37:52.893
Yes, sir, I did.

37:54.705 --> 37:58.505
- I knew it.
- John, she was 15 years old.

37:58.676 --> 38:01.611
You're a bastard, Sanders.
You know that?

38:01.779 --> 38:03.679
Yes, I do.

38:03.914 --> 38:06.439
And I'm damn proud of it. Sir.

38:16.827 --> 38:19.421
So, Andrea,
Danny tells me you're premed.

38:19.597 --> 38:22.532
- That's right.
- I was a premed major too.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.692
Then I married a doctor
instead of becoming one.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.064
Look out.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.706
I don't think there's danger
of Andrea being thrown off course.

38:29.874 --> 38:32.604
She's the most determined person
I've ever known.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.574
- What can I get you?
- I was determined too.

38:34.745 --> 38:37.305
And then Danny came along,
and of course, that changed...

38:37.481 --> 38:40.041
I don't think there's much danger
of that happening to me.

38:40.217 --> 38:41.241
God forbid.

38:46.290 --> 38:49.817
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I think I'd just like to grab a drink.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.725
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you. Thank you.

38:58.569 --> 38:59.831
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.302
You were at the Walshes'
anniversary party, weren't you?

39:02.473 --> 39:06.307
That's right. Jesse. Jesse Vasquez.

39:06.477 --> 39:08.877
I haven't forgotten your name.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.207
And I haven't forgotten yours
either, Andrea.

39:11.382 --> 39:15.079
Well, no good bartender
forgets a person's name, right?

39:15.252 --> 39:17.948
Well, I'm not exactly a bartender.
I just do this on the weekends.

39:19.724 --> 39:22.022
But I did remember your name.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.220
I think it's pretty amazing that
we should be meeting like this again.

39:26.664 --> 39:28.529
I don't know. Maybe it is.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.257
Well...

39:34.739 --> 39:35.797
You speak Spanish?

39:35.973 --> 39:39.773
<i>Well, I'm a native
of ciudad de Los Angeles.</i>

39:41.946 --> 39:44.972
- Is this your family, or?
- Not exactly.

39:45.149 --> 39:46.411
Friends?

39:47.952 --> 39:50.750
Actually,
a little bit more than friends.

39:50.921 --> 39:56.484
I'm dating the Rubins' son
and this is his parents' home.

39:56.727 --> 39:58.160
So, what can I get you?

39:59.196 --> 40:01.892
- A mineral water would be great.
- Coming right up.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.292
Andrea?

40:06.904 --> 40:08.735
What's your last name?

40:09.540 --> 40:11.064
Zuckerman.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.405
You know, I can probably get
thrown right out of here for saying this,

40:14.578 --> 40:18.207
but you have two of the most
beautiful eyes I've ever seen.

40:18.616 --> 40:20.311
I'd like to see them again.

40:23.888 --> 40:28.757
California University,
Marlow Hall, Room 417.

40:28.926 --> 40:31.588
That's... That's where I live.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.495
Great.

40:34.565 --> 40:36.123
Thanks.

40:40.137 --> 40:42.162
Cindy, everything
is absolutely wonderful.

40:42.339 --> 40:44.933
Well, thank you.
I'd be happy to give you the recipes.

40:45.109 --> 40:49.637
- No. No, no, just keep inviting me.
- Gladly.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.373
Dylan, how about
some more potatoes?

40:52.550 --> 40:54.017
Yeah, thanks.

40:57.588 --> 40:58.612
Potatoes, Kel?

40:59.623 --> 41:01.284
No, thank you.

41:03.561 --> 41:05.119
I'll take some potatoes.

41:08.699 --> 41:12.396
Well, it certainly is colder this year
than it was last.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.435
Yeah, it certainly is colder.

41:15.406 --> 41:17.340
You have got a lot of nerve.

41:19.944 --> 41:21.104
Will you excuse us, please?

41:23.214 --> 41:24.738
Yes, of course.

41:24.915 --> 41:26.143
Kel.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.644
Fine.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.685
Do you know what's going on?

41:39.263 --> 41:41.026
Don't look at me.

41:43.067 --> 41:45.695
- What exactly is your problem?
- I thought you were going to Baja.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.531
I thought that turkey
made you sleepy.

41:47.705 --> 41:48.729
I changed my mind.

41:48.906 --> 41:50.669
You didn't wanna have Thanksgiving
with me.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.105
But when Brenda asked you,
you showed up, is that it?

41:53.277 --> 41:55.370
Oh, no, that's not it.
That's not it at all.

41:55.546 --> 41:58.845
This is not about the Brenda and Dylan
and Kelly Bermuda Triangle here.

41:59.016 --> 42:02.110
Fine.
Now, at least I know where I stand.

42:02.820 --> 42:05.755
Would anybody like
some cranberry sauce?

42:05.923 --> 42:09.120
Hey, whoa, hey, you are the one
who has been jerking me around

42:09.293 --> 42:11.727
for six weeks
parading around with this idiot.

42:11.896 --> 42:14.194
I did not do anything
with John Sears.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.230
So you didn't sleep with him.
Big deal, so what?

42:16.400 --> 42:19.028
Kel, do you think
that's all there is in a relationship?

42:19.603 --> 42:21.161
I cared about you, and you said...

42:21.872 --> 42:23.863
You said you wanted to see
other people.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.532
Fine. I just wanted to have
Thanksgiving dinner with my friends

42:26.710 --> 42:29.270
and I like Cindy Walsh's turkey
better than I like Jackie's

42:29.446 --> 42:32.415
and obviously you feel the same way
or else you wouldn't be here.

42:33.350 --> 42:36.444
Dylan,
you could have at least told me.

42:36.620 --> 42:38.588
Maybe I should have.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.316
But can we just eat now?

43:06.884 --> 43:09.910
I followed the directions.
I swear I did.

43:10.087 --> 43:13.181
Well, maybe it was a recipe
for blackened turkey.

43:13.657 --> 43:17.616
That's a Cajun delicacy, right?

43:17.795 --> 43:19.524
Well, look on the bright side, Em.

43:19.697 --> 43:22.257
At least we didn't have to call
the fire department this time.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.425
Funny.

43:25.603 --> 43:28.367
Well, who needs turkey
for Thanksgiving anyway?

43:28.539 --> 43:30.200
My sentiments exactly.

43:30.374 --> 43:32.365
You guys know
a good pizza parlor in this town?

43:32.543 --> 43:34.067
- The best.
- I'm sure you do.

43:34.244 --> 43:38.112
A little pepperoni and we'll give thanks
for what really matters, huh?

43:38.282 --> 43:39.510
Thanks, guys.

43:39.683 --> 43:42.846
Come on, let's get out of here,
I'm starving. Let's go.

43:44.888 --> 43:50.622
He is definitely the cutest,
nicest thing I have ever met.

43:51.161 --> 43:52.651
I know.

43:52.830 --> 43:56.698
- So where did he sleep last night?
- On the couch.

43:57.534 --> 44:00.025
That's not gonna last long.

44:00.204 --> 44:04.265
Hey, ladies. Let's go, huh?
Come on, let's do this.

44:06.377 --> 44:08.538
You definitely got trouble here.

44:08.712 --> 44:12.478
- I love him. What am I gonna do?
- You're gonna tell him the truth.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.949
Yeah, I know. I will.

44:16.754 --> 44:17.880
Tomorrow, okay?

44:19.089 --> 44:21.649
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
