03:03.868 --> 03:06.376
At ease, gentlemen.
Be seated, please.

03:10.389 --> 03:13.322
As you've all probably noticed,
we're currently headed north.

03:13.362 --> 03:18.576
Tomorrow morning at 0500 hours, we will
be taking a position at Yankee Station.

03:19.117 --> 03:20.707
That means we're back in business.

03:20.747 --> 03:24.447
We'll be flying sorties over North Vietnam
to take out enemy supply lines,

03:24.487 --> 03:27.460
which means we have to
cross over into Laos.

03:29.091 --> 03:31.009
This mission is classified.

03:31.584 --> 03:36.148
No cards and letters to sweethearts.
No phone calls to family back home.

03:36.188 --> 03:38.969
–Is that understood?
–Yes, sir.

03:39.065 --> 03:40.695
No one can know.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.725
No one except Charlie
when we kick his ass.

03:44.723 --> 03:47.177
For survival
in the jungle environment,

03:47.217 --> 03:52.299
the smart soldier must understand
that nature is not a force against him.

03:52.395 --> 03:54.793
He has to make nature work for him

03:54.889 --> 03:59.109
by utilizing the ample natural
provisions at his disposal.

03:59.205 --> 04:01.123

04:05.822 --> 04:07.165
What is this?

04:08.411 --> 04:11.344
Hell, the boys back home
don't know anything about the jungle.

04:11.384 --> 04:14.126
In the jungle, your best friend
is your knife.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.755
Oh, look at…
Now he's getting serious.

04:18.002 --> 04:22.029

Come on, baby, cut. Cut.

04:30.757 --> 04:33.826

Look at him.

04:42.841 --> 04:45.966
And then, when
the rescue helicopter appears, make sure…

04:46.006 --> 04:48.787
Honestly, it's right
above your head!

04:49.650 --> 04:52.527
Jeez. Shake it, Pops.

04:53.966 --> 04:57.464
He's got a nice ass for a sailor,
I'll tell you that.

04:58.761 --> 05:01.063
I don't mean that in a weird way.

05:02.405 --> 05:03.844
God bless America.

05:03.940 --> 05:06.433
Are you a smart soldier?

05:07.105 --> 05:11.093
I mean, I just thought we'd be assisting
some South Vietnamese generals

05:11.133 --> 05:14.066
against a few infiltrators. Whole thing
would be done in three, four weeks.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.121
You picked the wrong time

05:15.161 --> 05:16.176
to enlist, Dengler.
–I know.

05:16.216 --> 05:17.902
No, but I just wanted to fly so badly,

05:17.942 --> 05:22.218
and everybody, they were telling me
all about the fantastic massage parlors

05:22.258 --> 05:24.327
and the go-go girls, everything, and…

05:24.367 --> 05:26.725
And what did I get?
Goddamn one night?

05:26.765 --> 05:29.506
–One night in Saigon. That's me.
–Yeah, and that didn't go so well.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.368
Gentlemen, next please.

05:33.095 --> 05:34.150
Okay.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.603
Hey, are there any mosquito nets?

05:36.643 --> 05:38.138
What you see is what you get.

05:38.178 --> 05:40.863
–Okay. Okay. I see plastic.
–Yes, sir.

05:40.959 --> 05:43.452
I see plastic there and how about…

05:43.644 --> 05:46.865
Are you able to give me two slices
of that plastic, please?

05:46.905 --> 05:48.975
–Sir?
–And maybe six foot by three foot,

05:49.015 --> 05:50.126
you put a zipper in the middle,

05:50.166 --> 05:51.181
and I crawl inside…
–What you're describing

05:51.221 --> 05:52.235
is a sauna, not a mosquito net.

05:52.275 --> 05:53.866
Not a mosquito net,
but it holds off the bugs.

05:53.906 --> 05:56.168
And you put some netting on it
so I can breathe through at night time.

05:56.208 --> 05:57.318
–You got it, sir.
–Yes?

05:57.358 --> 05:58.853
–Absolutely, sir.
–Okay.

05:58.893 --> 06:02.114
Now, look here. Look at this.
I have my boot on your table.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.799
–Why do I have my boot on your table?
–I don't know, sir.

06:04.839 --> 06:07.141
Okay, this is why. Look at this.

06:07.908 --> 06:11.264
Can you create a flap for me
in the tongue here

06:11.360 --> 06:14.677
so I could hide my American passport
inside of here should I need it?

06:14.717 --> 06:18.225
You know what, sir? Since you're my only
customer today, it would be my pleasure.

06:18.265 --> 06:19.512
Thank you.

06:21.334 --> 06:24.020
So, Charlie got his shit together.

06:24.116 --> 06:27.856
Now we have heavy antiaircraft fire
around Mugia Pass.

06:27.952 --> 06:31.404
Change direction and altitude
every seven seconds

06:31.500 --> 06:34.953
so the radar of the enemy gun
cannot lock onto you.

06:35.049 --> 06:39.748
Your secondary target will be
the intersection of 121 and 90.

06:39.844 --> 06:40.859
That's the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

06:40.899 --> 06:43.201
That's right, Spook, inside Laos.

06:43.296 --> 06:44.735
Now, one more thing.

06:44.831 --> 06:49.434
They've been using your radios
to lure our rescue teams into ambush.

06:50.010 --> 06:53.326
Now, don't get me wrong.
You go down, you use that radio.

06:53.366 --> 06:56.108
But if they're hot on your trail,
you scrap it.

06:56.148 --> 06:59.382
You scrap anything
that they can use against you.

07:00.367 --> 07:04.012
Now, this is Flight Lieutenant Dengler's
first mission.

07:04.108 --> 07:05.354
Yes, sir.

07:05.450 --> 07:06.889
(CHEERING)

07:06.985 --> 07:09.342
You're gonna be Spook's wingman.
You think you can handle that?

07:09.382 --> 07:12.028
I could not ask for a better man, sir.
But, please,

07:12.068 --> 07:14.138
could I ask you a question, sir?
–Go ahead.

07:14.178 --> 07:16.343
You know, Spook is such
a goddamn daredevil,

07:16.383 --> 07:20.851
could you please order him not to
try too hard to die for his country,

07:20.891 --> 07:25.841
but rather to let the son-of-a-bitch
on the other side die for his instead?

07:25.878 --> 07:27.700
Okay. All right, boys.

07:28.563 --> 07:30.147
–You all set?
–Yes, sir.

07:30.194 --> 07:31.248

07:31.344 --> 07:33.588
–No, sir.
–Okay. Let's go, go, go!

–Come on, Diet.

Come here.
This is what we would do as kids

07:48.511 --> 07:50.773
when we were out for mischief.
It would keep us out of trouble.

07:50.813 --> 07:52.979
But we would usually pee right now.

07:53.019 --> 07:54.801
–Can we pee?
–I don't really have to.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.184
I'm not gonna.

07:56.471 --> 07:59.177
But this will keep us safe. Okay, fellas?

07:59.732 --> 08:02.281
Stay out of trouble.
Come back in one piece. Good luck.

32:47.396 --> 32:49.314
–Dieter. Dieter.
–Yeah.

32:49.410 --> 32:51.041
Procet Kam Phong Kit.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.479
–What?
–Procet.

32:52.575 --> 32:54.301
–Okay.
–Procet.

32:54.397 --> 32:55.644
What was that?

32:55.836 --> 32:56.755
–Procet.
–It's okay.

32:56.795 --> 32:57.754
Okay.

32:57.850 --> 33:01.686
–That was actually Procet… Got that?
–Right.

33:01.782 --> 33:04.139
–But you need to call him Procet.
–Okay, Procet.

33:04.179 --> 33:05.386
That's what we call him.

33:05.426 --> 33:06.345
He's also Air America.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.551
–Also got shot down flying supplies…
–Okay, okay.

33:08.591 --> 33:09.702
to royalist villages,

33:09.742 --> 33:11.908
–just like the rest of us.
–And when was that?

33:11.948 --> 33:14.441
Two… No, two and a half year ago now.

33:15.304 --> 33:17.798
–Two and a half years ago?
–Oh, yeah.

33:17.894 --> 33:20.930
I had no idea that we were here
for that long.

33:20.963 --> 33:24.415
Yeah, been here a lot longer
than people know.

33:24.511 --> 33:26.677
–Duane Martin.
–Duane Martin. I'm Dieter Dengler.

33:26.717 --> 33:29.842
United States Air Force. I was shot down
about a year and a half ago.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.568
–Okay.
–And when this war starts,

33:31.608 --> 33:33.774
we'll be here a lot longer
than we already have.

33:33.814 --> 33:35.540
Well, you see…

33:36.211 --> 33:40.911
How many more times you think
I'm gonna have to say,

33:41.102 --> 33:45.610
like I been saying and saying and saying
and saying again,

33:45.706 --> 33:48.679
that we will never go to war
in Vietnam, man?

33:48.775 --> 33:49.982
–No, they just…
–They, no…

33:50.022 --> 33:52.763
Because any day now… Listen.
They will what?

33:52.803 --> 33:54.681
–Yeah, Christmas come every day.
–They…

33:54.721 --> 33:55.736
They will release us, man.

33:55.776 --> 33:56.735
(LAUGHING)

33:56.831 --> 34:00.092
They will let us go any day now.

34:00.283 --> 34:02.161
–No, you see…
–Gene, by the way.

34:02.201 --> 34:03.736
–Gene.
–But listen.

34:04.791 --> 34:07.436
It's… The trick to it
is it's actually Eugene.

34:07.476 --> 34:10.545
–Okay, Eugene.
–Eugene DeBruin from

34:10.641 --> 34:13.039
–Eugene, Oregon.
–Okay.

34:13.134 --> 34:15.053
–How do you like that?
–Yeah.

34:15.148 --> 34:17.458
See how that works out? Name, name…

34:17.545 --> 34:19.712
Jesus Christ, not this Oregon shit, again.

34:19.752 --> 34:22.397
I've heard this over 2,000 goddamn times.

34:22.437 --> 34:24.603
–Eugene from Eugene.
–Oh, yeah, right. Eugene from Eugene.

34:24.643 --> 34:26.137
–You know what? You know what? Listen.
–Yeah.

34:26.177 --> 34:29.822
What you really need to know is
you see this man here?

34:29.918 --> 34:32.030
Take a good look at him. He, he…

34:32.123 --> 34:38.261
Listen now, he shits in his pants
every night without fail, man.

34:38.357 --> 34:39.603
Trust me.

34:39.987 --> 34:43.112
And you know the only thing that he
thinks is worth complaining about?

34:43.152 --> 34:44.975
You know what that is?

34:45.071 --> 34:47.179
–This man right here.
–Right.

34:47.275 --> 34:49.520
–Eugene from Eugene.
–From Eugene.

34:50.058 --> 34:51.016
Okay.

34:51.112 --> 34:52.893
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

34:55.812 --> 34:56.963
Dieter.

34:57.059 --> 34:59.800
Take a careful look to your right.
You see that guy there?

34:59.840 --> 35:02.773
We call him Little Hitler
for a very good reason.

35:02.813 --> 35:04.251
He is the worst.

35:04.443 --> 35:07.224
This one we call Jumbo.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.855
Oh, wow.

35:08.951 --> 35:10.733
That's the first smile I've seen
since I was shot down.

35:10.773 --> 35:13.418
Yeah. He's, in fact,
one of the only truly nice guys here.

35:13.458 --> 35:18.012
This is Nook the Rook right here.
He's also very much not a nice guy.

35:20.363 --> 35:23.488
–What is his problem?
–It's all right. Just keep going.

35:23.528 --> 35:26.173
His problem is he's Crazy Horse.
That's what we call him.

35:26.213 --> 35:30.625
And he is a bastard. Keep going.
And I just cannot stand him.

35:30.721 --> 35:32.887
–That's Walkie Talkie.
–Walkie Talkie?

35:32.927 --> 35:36.623
We call him that 'cause he does not speak.
Never, never.

35:37.530 --> 35:40.887
Hey, do yourself a favor, Kraut.

35:40.983 --> 35:42.477
Keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

35:42.517 --> 35:45.011
That's your best chance of surviving.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.877
So there is a war.

36:11.001 --> 36:12.727
There is a war.

36:25.290 --> 36:28.223
All right. So tell me about
the peace talks, man. Geneva?

36:28.263 --> 36:30.661
There's got to be peace talks, man.

36:30.757 --> 36:33.594
Shut up, Gene.
There is no goddamn conference.

36:33.634 --> 36:34.745
When are you gonna get that
through your skull?

36:34.785 --> 36:37.526
Secret talks, man.
I'm just talking about secret talks.

36:37.566 --> 36:38.813
Forget it.

36:38.909 --> 36:40.211
We're not getting out.

36:40.251 --> 36:42.417
No, no, no, there was a honcho
on the outside,

36:42.457 --> 36:44.527
he said I would not be here too long.

36:44.567 --> 36:46.349
They tell that to everyone
to get them to sign.

36:46.389 --> 36:49.075
No, I did not sign. No.

36:51.088 --> 36:54.925
Anyway, nice having met you.

36:55.596 --> 36:57.226
What do you mean, met?

36:57.322 --> 37:00.679
Well, my friends,
you can rot in here if you like,

37:01.830 --> 37:04.707
but I'm gonna scram this very night.

37:05.762 --> 37:08.064
This hut, it ain't no prison.

37:10.461 --> 37:13.818
Scram. I like that. I like that.

37:13.914 --> 37:17.750
Listen, listen, my friend,
you cannot escape.

37:17.846 --> 37:21.146
If you try to escape,
you'll screw up our release.

37:21.202 --> 37:25.574
Look, I don't give a shit about our release
or whatever you think is gonna happen.

37:25.614 --> 37:30.697
But without water, you won't survive
more than two days out there.

37:30.793 --> 37:34.819
And without water,
your tracks will be visible for even more.

37:35.396 --> 37:38.369
The jungle is the prison. Don't you get it?

37:40.959 --> 37:44.987
Hey, when does the rainy season start?

37:45.082 --> 37:46.905
Five months, maybe six.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.782
I can't wait that long.

37:49.878 --> 37:54.865
Hey, listen, let's say you do survive
the jungle and lack of water,

37:54.961 --> 37:58.757
whatever you find, snakes and animals
and shit are out there,

37:58.797 --> 38:00.675
you won't make it out of camp.

38:00.715 --> 38:03.421
There's six guards posted during the day.

38:05.606 --> 38:06.661
Yeah.

38:07.332 --> 38:09.059
That is during the day.

38:10.977 --> 38:12.607
I'm going at night.

38:21.142 --> 38:22.924
Why, what happens at night?

38:24.020 --> 38:24.883
No.

38:25.842 --> 38:26.801
No.

38:27.280 --> 38:28.239
No.

38:31.692 --> 38:33.898
I'm shitting my intestines out.

38:36.487 --> 38:37.830
Again.

38:37.926 --> 38:39.940
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

38:41.282 --> 38:45.023
You just shit right on my hand again, man.

38:45.118 --> 38:49.914
–Sorry.
–That makes it 2,207 times and counting.

38:50.010 --> 38:51.726
Leave the guy alone, okay?

38:51.832 --> 38:53.846
There ain't no alone, brother.

38:54.325 --> 38:56.339
Does anybody have a nail?

38:56.435 --> 38:58.217
What are you gonna do with a nail?

38:58.257 --> 39:00.999
You're gonna stab all the lousy guards
to death with a nail?

39:01.039 --> 39:03.340
What kind of plane you fly off of?

39:04.012 --> 39:06.945
–Procet has got a shard of glass, man.
–No, that's no good.

39:06.985 --> 39:08.191
I have porcupine needle.

39:08.231 --> 39:09.478
No.

39:10.437 --> 39:14.133
I've got a hammer and a socket wrench
stuffed up my ass.

39:16.959 --> 39:18.397
There's no nails.

39:18.493 --> 39:20.755
This whole prison's made
of bamboo and rattan.

39:20.795 --> 39:21.850
Damn it.

39:25.686 --> 39:27.700
I know where there's a nail.

39:40.839 --> 39:41.894
Okay.

39:43.140 --> 39:44.867
I'm gonna make my move.

39:46.113 --> 39:48.759
So all of you scatter in
all directions, okay? Go.

39:48.799 --> 39:49.950
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

39:50.046 --> 39:54.649
What makes you think you're not crazy
for thinking that'll work, man?

39:54.745 --> 39:57.102
Eugene's right.
It'll attract too much attention.

39:57.142 --> 40:00.307
Oh, for God's sake, that's what I want.

40:00.403 --> 40:01.650
Please.

40:02.417 --> 40:04.623
You trust me? Please.

40:04.719 --> 40:07.788
Duane, head to the outhouse.

40:07.884 --> 40:10.185
Y.C, go to the top right. Okay?

40:10.281 --> 40:12.871
Gene, please come on. No, no, no.

40:12.967 --> 40:17.186
Gene, Phisit, Procet,
head towards the gate.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.104
Move as fast as you can.

40:19.776 --> 40:24.000
Get their attention, that's what I need.
Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

40:36.847 --> 40:39.157
Hey, Jumbo, Jumbo. Hey, no, no, no.

40:39.244 --> 40:44.128
Can I borrow some of the toothpaste?
Let me get some of that. That's good.

40:44.807 --> 40:47.780
I felt so like having a good smile,
you know?

40:47.876 --> 40:50.582
Like you have. You got a good smile, too.

40:51.904 --> 40:53.055
Okay.

40:59.192 --> 41:02.453
Y.C., when I hit it, you make a noise.

41:02.645 --> 41:04.275
Cough or something.

42:17.162 --> 42:20.519
Oh, God. Oh, God, that was an easy one.

42:23.396 --> 42:29.150
You see, I apprenticed as a tool
and die maker in Germany.

42:31.452 --> 42:36.439
There was no aviation at the time
and I wanted to learn something useful

42:36.535 --> 42:38.317
that would help me repair planes.

42:38.357 --> 42:42.961
And, boy, are those years coming in handy
in unexpected ways now.

42:43.056 --> 42:45.414
There's only one brand
that I cannot handle,

42:45.454 --> 42:47.104
that is Smith and Wesson.

42:48.427 --> 42:49.290
(EXCLAIMS)

42:51.208 --> 42:56.483
I think with practice, I can open these up
in maybe two, three seconds flat.

42:59.648 --> 43:05.498
But listen, everybody keep one cuff
on a wrist at all times,

43:06.553 --> 43:10.349
so that if the guards come checking,
we can put them on again quickly.

43:10.389 --> 43:13.610
No, they don't check us at night.
They think we can't get out of these.

43:13.650 --> 43:15.472
They think it's impossible.

43:15.664 --> 43:17.582
Show me how you did that.

43:18.637 --> 43:21.514
It's so simple. Okay.

43:22.185 --> 43:25.254
All you do, insert the nail.

43:25.830 --> 43:28.859
There's a cuff and a spring.
They both have teeth.

43:28.899 --> 43:33.118
You push down on the spring,
disengage the teeth like that.

43:33.214 --> 43:36.283
You see? This is what happens inside.

43:38.105 --> 43:40.311
–And the cuffs release.
–Wow.

43:41.654 --> 43:42.613
Hands free.

44:01.314 --> 44:02.465
Get away.

44:04.767 --> 44:05.822
Get away.

44:05.918 --> 44:09.658
No, no, no, no, no. Let him.
He's our friend, Malay.

44:09.754 --> 44:12.591
Let him do it. It's the best way
to heal sores around here.

44:12.631 --> 44:13.782
Okay.

44:14.165 --> 44:15.412
Hey,

44:16.467 --> 44:19.152
that cuff thing, that's good, real good.

44:19.248 --> 44:21.262
Yeah. Thanks.

44:22.509 --> 44:23.852
Hey, Duane,

44:25.578 --> 44:28.511
do you know where we are?
I mean, you have any idea?

44:28.551 --> 44:32.483
No. But my guess
is that this here's still Laos.

44:33.058 --> 44:34.977
And the guards, they're…

44:35.072 --> 44:36.183
–Laotian.
–… Laotian?

44:36.223 --> 44:37.910
–Yeah.
–Yeah, but the camp is Vietcong,

44:37.950 --> 44:39.484
there's no question.

44:39.580 --> 44:41.978
Look, I know what you're thinking,

44:43.128 --> 44:46.164
but jungles on these mountains
is a nightmare.

44:48.211 --> 44:50.513
Besides, you'd end up in Vietnam.

44:50.609 --> 44:53.254
–No, but if we can get to Thailand…
–Yeah.

44:53.294 --> 44:54.885
If we can make it to the Mekong River…

44:54.925 --> 44:56.899
Yeah, the Big Muddy.
If you could, you would, right?

44:56.939 --> 44:58.377
Yeah. We can.

44:59.240 --> 45:01.926
–Hey, why not? We can.
–Yeah.

45:02.022 --> 45:04.419
Just stop talking about it. Okay?

45:04.515 --> 45:06.433

about the country?

but he doesn't talk to us.

Two years ago a parcel came through.

47:10.629 --> 47:11.684
Yeah.

47:12.547 --> 47:15.253
He puts it on display on really bad days.

47:17.054 --> 47:20.219
The bacon label still looks greasy.

47:21.082 --> 47:22.961
Does it still have a scent on it?

47:23.001 --> 47:24.343
Oh, you bet.

47:26.261 --> 47:27.700
Can I get a sniff?

47:27.796 --> 47:29.426
Oh, no, you may not.

47:30.385 --> 47:32.783
You may not. That is my sniff.

47:33.646 --> 47:35.852
Man, that is my sniff.

47:48.895 --> 47:49.950
Hey.

47:51.484 --> 47:53.498
How'd you ever end up a pilot?

47:55.128 --> 47:57.718
I always… I always wanted to be one.

47:58.677 --> 47:59.924
I was

48:01.170 --> 48:05.446
five years old, or something, in a little
town, Wildberg, in the Black Forest,

48:05.486 --> 48:08.747
and it was just bombed to ashes,
you know?

48:08.843 --> 48:11.879
No clear reason,
just these senseless attacks.

48:12.967 --> 48:17.666
But I remember I was in the attic
with my brother.

48:19.296 --> 48:21.022
We were looking out,

48:21.694 --> 48:24.859
and we see this fighter plane,

48:25.434 --> 48:28.791
beautiful, coming right at us.

48:29.750 --> 48:31.628
And it's firing from its wings,

48:31.668 --> 48:35.600
and I see the machine gun,
it's flashing and it

48:36.655 --> 48:37.975
(IMITATES WHOOSHING)

48:37.998 --> 48:39.492
goes flying past the house.

48:39.532 --> 48:44.327
It's so close. I mean,
it's feet away from the house.

48:46.149 --> 48:48.931
And the canopy was open.

48:50.561 --> 48:55.836
And this pilot,
he had his goggles up on his helmet.

48:57.082 --> 48:59.001
And I could see his eyes.

48:59.864 --> 49:01.878
And he was looking at me.

49:02.741 --> 49:03.988
Right at me.

49:04.083 --> 49:05.733
He's looking right at me.

49:05.810 --> 49:09.222
And as he turns to go, he's starting back,
he's looking right at me still.

49:09.262 --> 49:10.893
And the thing is,

49:11.660 --> 49:15.016
from that moment on, little Dieter,

49:16.167 --> 49:17.990
he needed to fly.

49:21.058 --> 49:23.072
You're a strange bird, Dieter.

49:23.648 --> 49:26.486
Guy tries to kill you and you want his job.

49:30.841 --> 49:32.183
Yeah.

50:01.626 --> 50:03.544
God, we need the rain.

50:04.503 --> 50:06.805
We need the rain to come quicker.

50:10.353 --> 50:15.340
See, here's what I can see,
you still need to understand.

50:15.436 --> 50:18.945
–No, I understand.
–You wanna talk about the rain again, we…

50:18.985 --> 50:20.807
Listen, now. Listen.

50:20.903 --> 50:25.506
We will be released
by the time the rain comes

50:25.602 --> 50:27.288
like I have told you before…

50:27.328 --> 50:30.549
–Stop telling me.
–I don't wanna have to keep telling you.

50:30.589 --> 50:33.559
–Then stop telling me.
–They will release us.

50:33.562 --> 50:34.617
You understand?

50:34.713 --> 50:36.495
And here's what I'm starting to think,

50:36.535 --> 50:39.412
that maybe you're trying
not to understand.

50:39.508 --> 50:43.440
If you try and escape, we,

50:44.111 --> 50:46.989
we will be killed,
we who you leave behind.

50:47.084 --> 50:49.730
–It's not just me, we all try to escape.
–Taking off. We who have been here

50:49.770 --> 50:51.592
for two years.

50:51.688 --> 50:53.470
Two years before you showed up.

50:53.510 --> 50:56.059
I don't want to escape alone.
We escape together.

50:56.099 --> 50:58.937
Wait, wait.
Why would the guards spend all this time

50:58.977 --> 51:01.718
cutting bamboo and wood
to build a watchtower

51:01.758 --> 51:03.444
if we weren't meant
to be here for a while?

51:03.484 --> 51:04.499
–Exactly.
–Two years.

51:04.539 --> 51:06.609
–Exactly. Why would they do that if they…
–Listen. Listen to me.

51:06.649 --> 51:09.582
–…didn't plan to hold us a long time?
–Listen. Here's what it all comes down to.

51:09.622 --> 51:13.746
I am not, I'm not gonna let you do that.

51:13.842 --> 51:14.993
No, no, no.

51:15.088 --> 51:16.775
You know what I am gonna do?

51:16.815 --> 51:18.349
I am gonna scream.

51:18.829 --> 51:22.195
That's right. I think
I'm gonna scream my head off.

–I'm sure she is.

are gonna want to check that.
–Crazy. This is…

Why are you hiding it now?

Yes.

that the guards when they are called
to the kitchen hut for chow time,

56:58.329 --> 57:00.303
they always leave
their rifles behind, always?

So we have a few minutes
before they return for their rifles.

we grab their guns,

–we surprise them.
–No.

–And we surprise… We surprise them…
–Crazy.

57:11.372 --> 57:12.962
and we surround them, okay?

Then we take the guards as prisoners.

We take over the camp.

01:20:24.283 --> 01:20:25.434
Oh, yeah.

01:20:27.736 --> 01:20:29.270
Oh, that's funny?

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:32.726
–Why is that funny?
–'Cause I was just thinking,

01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:37.326
maybe you'll go back
and get one yourself.

01:20:37.422 --> 01:20:39.300

01:23:52.107 --> 01:23:54.121
Down there must be a river.

01:23:54.217 --> 01:23:56.327
It must lead to the Big Muddy.

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:59.108
And then we'll be out of here.

That's a trick question, right?

01:30:21.286 --> 01:30:23.464
We can trade off with this thing.

01:30:24.930 --> 01:30:28.343
There's no way that
we shoot it out with the Vietcong

01:30:28.383 --> 01:30:30.109
if we run into them, so…

01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:34.956
And we can't use these for hunting
because of the noise.

01:30:37.494 --> 01:30:39.220

01:30:40.755 --> 01:30:41.809

01:49:26.477 --> 01:49:29.697
In fact, from now on, it's a
black operation. Is that clear?

01:49:29.737 --> 01:49:30.848
You got me on that?

01:49:30.888 --> 01:49:32.287
–Back up. Back up.
–Stand back.

01:49:32.327 --> 01:49:33.765
All right. Let's go.

01:49:35.971 --> 01:49:37.985
You're doing great, Dieter.

01:49:38.273 --> 01:49:40.287
You don't need this anymore.

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:48.151
(WHISPERING)
Hey, when can I go back to my ship?

01:49:50.165 --> 01:49:51.508
I don't know.

01:50:19.799 --> 01:50:21.813
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

01:50:24.211 --> 01:50:26.225
You guys are a lot of fun.

01:50:26.321 --> 01:50:30.692
You know, how many times I have to
tell you? I don't know the coordinates.

01:50:30.732 --> 01:50:33.186
Let's go back to the guards.
Tell me about their uniforms.

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:36.447
There were some with red stars,
maybe they're Vietcong.

01:50:36.487 --> 01:50:38.692
The others were Laotians…

01:50:38.788 --> 01:50:40.035
Oh, no.

01:50:40.131 --> 01:50:41.378
Oh, no.

01:50:43.679 --> 01:50:44.830
Dieter!

01:50:45.022 --> 01:50:46.276
There's my buddies.

01:50:46.365 --> 01:50:49.242
–Happy birthday.
–That's my buddies.

01:50:49.434 --> 01:50:50.489
You made it.

01:50:50.585 --> 01:50:52.599
It's good to see you, Spook.

01:50:53.749 --> 01:50:54.900
Dieter.

01:50:54.996 --> 01:50:57.394
Norman. Oh, my God.

01:50:57.490 --> 01:50:59.655
Gentlemen, can you give us
a couple of minutes alone, please?

01:50:59.695 --> 01:51:01.213
It should be all right.

01:51:01.230 --> 01:51:03.819
I got a little letter from his fiancée.

01:51:03.915 --> 01:51:05.889
It's kind of personal.
You know what I mean?

01:51:05.929 --> 01:51:07.711
Keep it personal, Lieutenant.

01:51:07.751 --> 01:51:10.684
We're in the middle of
a highly classified debriefing.

01:51:10.724 --> 01:51:12.219
Will do. It's from his old lady.

01:51:12.259 --> 01:51:13.793
–Ten minutes.
–Okay.

01:51:13.889 --> 01:51:15.328
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:51:15.424 --> 01:51:16.479
Thank you.

01:51:16.575 --> 01:51:21.082
Hey, Spook, what's with the birthday…
It's not my birthday.

01:51:21.274 --> 01:51:25.960
Dieter, those two CIA dudes wanna take
you back to Guam for debriefing.

01:51:26.645 --> 01:51:28.850
You don't wanna do that, do you?

01:51:29.809 --> 01:51:31.344
I didn't think so.

01:51:51.771 --> 01:51:53.114
Hey, hold on, guys.

01:51:53.689 --> 01:51:57.430
Hey, guys, he's a bit choked up in there.

01:51:58.101 --> 01:52:02.473
You mind giving him just a couple of
minutes to sort of pull himself together?

01:52:02.513 --> 01:52:05.062
Yeah, it should be fine.
We'll give it a few minutes.

01:52:05.102 --> 01:52:07.116
–He's a good kid, huh?
–Yeah.

01:52:07.212 --> 01:52:08.746
–Thanks, guys.
–Yup.

01:52:17.474 --> 01:52:22.940
…Right, left.
Left, left, left, right, left.

01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:29.078
Come on, now.

01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:32.914
Hurry up. Come on, get him in.

01:52:34.065 --> 01:52:35.983
Get him in now, fast!

01:52:36.079 --> 01:52:37.326
Get inside.

01:52:50.081 --> 01:52:51.616
(WHOOPING) It's my day!

01:53:01.781 --> 01:53:03.316
What are we doing?

01:53:21.825 --> 01:53:22.976
–Hey.
–What?

01:53:23.072 --> 01:53:24.702
Where is everybody?

01:53:24.798 --> 01:53:25.813
–Where?
–Right here.

01:53:25.853 --> 01:53:28.211
Why the decks… They're empty.
Have they gone home?

01:53:28.251 --> 01:53:30.553
–Yeah.
–Yeah.

01:53:31.128 --> 01:53:32.239
They're on vacation.

01:53:32.279 --> 01:53:33.717
Is the war over?

01:53:35.156 --> 01:53:36.211
No.

01:53:41.869 --> 01:53:44.171
You know I'm in a lot of trouble.

01:53:50.884 --> 01:53:52.515
Boys, here he is.

01:53:52.611 --> 01:53:54.872
They kidnapped him,
they brought him here to us.

01:53:54.912 --> 01:53:57.941
The CIA held him for four days
but they can't hang onto him forever!

01:53:57.981 --> 01:54:00.379
Dieter Dengler!

01:54:06.325 --> 01:54:09.586
All right, all right. Hold on.
Hold on a second.

01:54:09.681 --> 01:54:11.080
Boys, listen up for a second.

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:13.574
Admiral Willoughby's
got something to say.

01:54:13.614 --> 01:54:15.244
Lieutenant Dengler.

01:54:18.121 --> 01:54:19.847
Good to have you back.

01:54:23.492 --> 01:54:25.370
–Thank you.
–All right. That's not all.

01:54:25.410 --> 01:54:28.766
There's more! Hold on, fellows.
Hold on, hold on!

01:54:29.821 --> 01:54:31.220
So, let's start with the man himself.

01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:33.138
Dieter, it is just incredible
you made it home.

01:54:33.178 --> 01:54:36.544
Now, tell us, was it your faith
in God and country?

01:54:37.494 --> 01:54:40.043
Come on, Dieter,
you got to believe in something.

01:54:40.083 --> 01:54:41.673
I believe I need a steak.

01:54:41.713 --> 01:54:44.399
A steak! This guy needs a steak!

01:54:44.495 --> 01:54:46.565
We're grilling up a big old cow for you.

01:54:46.605 --> 01:54:49.578
All right. Hey, listen up. Hang on.

01:54:49.673 --> 01:54:51.935
Can you pass something on to the boys?

01:54:51.975 --> 01:54:53.566
You know, something you learned
during your ordeal,

01:54:53.606 --> 01:54:57.442
something to keep them going
no matter how bad it gets?

01:54:58.113 --> 01:54:59.456
Sure I can.

01:55:02.045 --> 01:55:05.114
Empty what is full.

01:55:06.457 --> 01:55:08.950
Fill what is empty.

01:55:12.690 --> 01:55:15.472
Scratch where it itches. That's it.

01:55:15.568 --> 01:55:17.158
Now look at these boys ' faces.

01:55:17.198 --> 01:55:19.116
Do they love you, man!

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:22.664
Do they love you!

01:55:23.624 --> 01:55:24.944
