00:02.536 --> 00:03.937
<i>Previously on</i>
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.038 --> 00:06.740
America used to have
a booming textiles industry.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.209
And we moved it all overseas.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.744
Why don't we bring it back?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.213
The cost would be astronomical.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.781
Only at first.

00:13.881 --> 00:16.184
But if we could control
our socks, start to finish,

00:16.284 --> 00:18.352
our profit would skyrocket.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.490
We could be completely
vertically integrated.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.126
Everything from
spinning to knitting,

00:25.226 --> 00:26.127
The whole shebang.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.261
Shebang?
Magilla.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.796
Ah, yes.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.798
Other companies
will call us

00:30.898 --> 00:32.466
when <i>they</i> have
shipping problems.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.001
And we would gladly
help them out,

00:34.102 --> 00:36.170
charging ludicrous fees.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.471
It's going to be
a lot of work.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.739
I've got to find a warehouse,

00:38.839 --> 00:40.608
buy knitting machines,
sock ovens,

00:40.708 --> 00:42.676
those little "made in America"
stickers with the flags on them.

00:44.011 --> 00:47.415
All I heard is that it's
going to be a lot of work.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.417
Well, it's also going
to be expensive.
Mm-hmm.

00:49.517 --> 00:50.984
We'll have to get
a big loan.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.886
We'll have to put up
some kind of collateral.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.055
Collateral?
Yeah, probably the house.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.725
This house?

00:57.825 --> 00:59.427
Don't worry, we're
not going to lose it.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.730
No one ever thinks they're
going to lose their house.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.865
That's right.
Positive thinking.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.734
Thanks for talking
me into this.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.869
You're the best.

01:12.873 --> 01:16.144
All right,
now watch your step.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.478
We're almost there.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.879
I know where we are, Bob.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.314
No, you don't.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.783
It is the warehouse you want
to throw away our home for.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.553
Not throw away,
but good guess.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.521
Are you ready?
Sure.

01:28.422 --> 01:31.325
Ugh.
Ta-da!

01:31.425 --> 01:32.393
Oh, my God.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.295
I know it needs work,

01:34.395 --> 01:35.363
but think of the potential.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.165
Oh, my God.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.966
You get a deal on a fixer-upper.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.802
Oh, my God.

01:41.902 --> 01:42.870
But just imagine:

01:42.970 --> 01:45.072
instead of these
piles of garbage,

01:45.173 --> 01:47.175
rows of sewing machines.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.376
And through that door

01:48.476 --> 01:50.144
that's rusted shut,

01:50.244 --> 01:51.145
sock ovens,

01:51.245 --> 01:53.013
baking away.

01:53.113 --> 01:57.251
And we'd be bringing jobs back
to Detroit and changing lives.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.121
And how much will these
imaginary machines cost?

02:02.723 --> 02:05.058
Sure, we're going to spend
a lot of money in the beginning,

02:05.159 --> 02:06.427
but we're going to get it
back in the end.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.529
Or we could never begin

02:08.629 --> 02:10.964
and Dele could go to college.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.099
I know it's scary,

02:12.200 --> 02:13.167
but I promise you,

02:13.267 --> 02:14.668
I'm making smart choices here.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.238
Name one.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.506
Well, instead of
buying the place,

02:18.606 --> 02:20.140
we're gonna lease for a while.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.710
And how long is a while?

02:23.611 --> 02:24.812
Ten years.

02:26.046 --> 02:27.515
I think I'm going
to be sick.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.749
Where is the bathroom?

02:28.849 --> 02:31.151
Oh, you don't want
to go in the bathroom.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.218
Are you okay?

03:04.318 --> 03:05.919
You've been chugging
coffee all morning.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.721
I'm having
trouble sleeping.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.257
Insomnia?

03:09.357 --> 03:11.058
Bob.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.794
I got some gummies
you can try.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.363
One will
help you relax,

03:15.463 --> 03:16.730
two will knock you out,

03:16.830 --> 03:21.735
three will turn a Friday
into a Sunday real fast.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.805
Hello, ladies. Hey.

03:24.905 --> 03:25.806
Hi, Kemi.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.675
Oh, my.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.310
You look terrible.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.412
She's not sleeping.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.414
Hmm. Me neither.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.317
Usually a double dose of
Chukwuemeka puts me to sleep,

03:36.417 --> 03:39.853
but he hasn't filled
my prescription in days.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.422
If you catch my drift.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.558
There are patients in comas
that caught your drift.

03:45.526 --> 03:48.262
You know, it's my fault for
telling Bob to go back to work.

03:48.362 --> 03:51.399
Mmm. I wish Chukwuemeka
would return to work.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.900
And by returning
to work, I mean--

03:53.000 --> 03:54.702
Abishola's got real problems.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.939
Last year, when my husband blew
our retirement nest egg,

03:59.039 --> 04:01.208
I was this close
to throwing him out.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.343
Why didn't you?

04:02.443 --> 04:05.012
Our dog would've
been heartbroken.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.780
I'd have been fine.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.650
So, what did Bob say

04:09.750 --> 04:11.084
when you forbid him
to go through with this?

04:11.184 --> 04:12.486
I did not forbid him.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.154
I see.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.823
So, this really is your fault.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.727
No, I made it very clear
I thought it was a bad idea.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.462
Oh, look at you
putting your foot down.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.364
"Oh, it's a really bad idea."

04:23.464 --> 04:24.698
That's not helping.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.867
I apologize.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.470
I've just been very tense
because Chukwuemeka--

04:29.570 --> 04:30.804
We know why!
We get it!

04:35.576 --> 04:36.877
You got a minute?
What's up?

04:36.977 --> 04:37.978
I need a favor.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.313
I already told you,

04:39.413 --> 04:41.582
I'm not voting Democrat.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.150
Not that.
You know those home movies

04:43.250 --> 04:45.152
from when you and Dad
started MaxDot?

04:45.252 --> 04:46.654
Oh, yeah.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.822
We filmed all
our big milestones.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.023
Our first sale,

04:50.123 --> 04:51.559
our first Christmas party.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.894
We had to turn over some of
that footage to the cops.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.063
Do you still
have any of it?

04:56.163 --> 04:57.064
The-the PG stuff.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.732
In a box somewhere, why?

04:58.832 --> 05:02.169
I was hoping you'd walk
Abishola down memory lane,

05:02.269 --> 05:04.037
explain to her
all the risks

05:04.137 --> 05:05.839
you and Dad took
to create all this

05:05.939 --> 05:07.174
were worth it.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.843
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.278
Why not?

05:11.379 --> 05:14.181
Honey, we started with nothing
but a good idea.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.649
And after years
of hard work,

05:15.749 --> 05:19.252
we turned that good idea
into a successful company.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.154
And that's the same thing
I'm doing.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.257
Almost, except your idea stinks.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.059
It doesn't stink.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.028
I am bringing
American manufacturing

05:28.128 --> 05:29.663
back to the beating heart
of this country.

05:29.763 --> 05:33.401
Use all the fancy words
you want, it's still doo-doo.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.669
Please, I need
your support.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.405
I want Abishola to see
what I see.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.207
This could be my legacy,
my destiny.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.376
Honey, it's socks.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.678
I know it's socks!

05:44.778 --> 05:47.381
You talking about
his terrible idea?
Really?

05:47.481 --> 05:48.816
Abishola
hates it, too.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.283
She's smart.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.453
I was gonna ask you to
help me run the new factory,

05:52.553 --> 05:54.054
get you off the warehouse floor.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.423
Oh, thanks.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.590
That's a very nice offer,

05:56.690 --> 05:58.058
but I'm really trying to make

05:58.158 --> 05:59.893
good choices these days.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.663
Christina, come
here for a second.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.832
Spill something?

06:04.932 --> 06:08.268
Christina understands
risk/reward. Tell 'em.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.371
No guts, no glory.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.141
No shower, either.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.143
Actually, it's the uniform.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.712
You're smelling
the previous janitor.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.915
She quit the
family business

06:22.015 --> 06:23.350
to go work for a competitor

06:23.451 --> 06:24.952
because she saw room for growth,

06:25.052 --> 06:26.086
for expansion.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.789
Yeah, and look at me now.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.593
Never mind, you can go.
Go where?

06:32.693 --> 06:33.894
Just go.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.900
Excuse me, excuse me.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.535
Excuse me.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.938
I am allowed to cut because
the pharmacist is my lover.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.674
Excuse me.

06:46.774 --> 06:47.975
Hello, darling.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.843
Kemi, what are you doing here?

06:49.943 --> 06:51.779
Hopefully you,

06:51.879 --> 06:53.080
in the storage closet.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.382
I am sorry,
I have to work.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.350
Well, just take
a five-minute break.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.052
We can skip the kissing.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.988
You do not understand.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.322
My career's in trouble.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.591
What? Why?

07:03.691 --> 07:05.392
For the first time
in three years,

07:05.493 --> 07:07.928
I am not Employee of the Month.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.497
Oh, okay.

07:09.597 --> 07:12.232
Would it help if I called you
Employee of the Month

07:12.332 --> 07:14.201
while you made love to me?

07:14.301 --> 07:16.203
Is sex all you think about?

07:16.303 --> 07:19.540
No. I also like
fantasy football.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.442
Ever since we started
seeing each other,

07:22.543 --> 07:25.378
I have put your needs
ahead of my customers'.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.381
As you should.
No, because now Lisa Mendez

07:28.482 --> 07:30.584
is Employee of the Month!

07:33.621 --> 07:36.824
So, when your picture
is back on the wall,

07:36.924 --> 07:39.059
you will become
my naughty boy again?

07:39.159 --> 07:40.828
You do not hear me.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.666
Underneath this rock-solid body
is a man in pain.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.368
Chukwuemeka, you have
customers waiting.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.370
Yes, Lisa.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.105
You see what you
have done to me?

07:52.205 --> 07:53.874
Next customer, please.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.949
Hey, come with me.
Where are we going?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.617
The leasing office,
we're getting that warehouse.

08:03.717 --> 08:04.985
So, your wife approves?

08:05.085 --> 08:06.987
No, the whole thing makes
her sick. Come on.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.422
You are a brave man,
Mr. Wheeler.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.725
I will follow you
to the end of your marriage.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.093
She'll be fine.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.962
When you've got a good idea,
you got to run with it.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.363
Look at Jobs, Musk, Bezos.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.965
Dangote.
Who's that?

08:18.065 --> 08:19.533
Aliko Dangote.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.201
Nigerian cement mogul.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.936
Richest Black man in the world.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.705
Until you.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.474
Let's do it.

08:27.575 --> 08:30.010
I'm coming for
you, Mr. Dangote!

08:34.548 --> 08:36.383
Did you hear your
Auntie Felicia died?

08:36.483 --> 08:37.651
Should I know who that is?

08:37.751 --> 08:40.020
She held you twice as a baby.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.255
And dropped you once.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.793
Rest in peace,
Auntie Butterfingers.

08:45.893 --> 08:46.694
Hey.

08:46.794 --> 08:47.795
Hey, Bob.
Hey, Bob.

08:47.895 --> 08:48.896
Sorry I'm late,

08:48.996 --> 08:50.864
hope you got started
without me.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.132
Of course we did.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.602
Where were you?
We'll talk about it later.

08:54.702 --> 08:55.869
It's boring work stuff.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.638
I don't want
to bring down the party.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.673
We were talking
about dead people.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.977
Well, uh, you know that
warehouse I had my eye on?

09:04.077 --> 09:05.412
Mm-hmm.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.479
Some other people were
starting to sniff around,

09:06.580 --> 09:08.381
so we went ahead and got it.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.783
Oh!

09:09.883 --> 09:12.052
Congratulations
are in order.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.287
But we discussed that
was not a good idea.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.923
Honey, I know you're nervous.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.357
Do not "honey" me.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.060
You are risking
everything we have!

09:20.160 --> 09:22.730
I withdraw my congratulations.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.164
You knew how I felt about this

09:24.264 --> 09:25.298
and you did it anyway.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.100
Because it's the right move.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.301
According to you.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.403
And only you.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.740
Hey, you know, you're the one

09:32.840 --> 09:34.574
who's been pushing me
to go back to work!

09:42.315 --> 09:43.383
Sorry you had to see that.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.686
That is okay.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.822
I'm sure you guys have
your share of disagreements.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.457
Not one that bad.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.526
But every marriage
is different.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.375
'Kay.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.011
Uh, excuse me?

10:11.111 --> 10:13.781
Another round and
three shots of tequila, please.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.148
Oh, any more shots

10:15.248 --> 10:17.785
and y'all are gonna have
to carry me out of here.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.419
I am the opposite.

10:19.519 --> 10:22.823
After enough drinks, I feel
like I can flip over a car.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.458
We can charge it to Bob's Visa,

10:25.558 --> 10:26.760
while he still has good credit.

10:26.860 --> 10:30.030
Ooh. In that case, uh,
bring the bottle.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.099
And some of those
hot, crunchy peas.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.936
Bob is so stubborn.

10:36.036 --> 10:39.172
Chukwuemeka is
so fragile.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.241
My husband's terrific.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.476
Look, he bought me
these earrings.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.245
Boo!
Boo!

10:45.345 --> 10:47.280
Yay!
Yay!

10:47.380 --> 10:49.316
Drinks.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.451
I would like
to make a toast.

10:51.551 --> 10:52.920
To Bob...

10:56.089 --> 10:57.925
I forgot what
I was going to say.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.093
Let's just call him an idiot.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.294
To the idiot.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.529
Yay!

11:02.629 --> 11:05.098
Uh-uh, Kemi,
you're not clinking.

11:05.198 --> 11:09.002
That man is staring at me
like I'm a piece of meat.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.272
Honey, I think
he might be a vegetarian.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.444
Well, let's see if
he would like a Beyond burger.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.448
Have fun.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.419
She's so fun.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.460
Welcome to
MaxDot manufacturing.

11:34.862 --> 11:38.065
Children, behold your
father's kingdom.

11:38.165 --> 11:41.068
I am so proud of
you, husband.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.570
I could not have done it
without you, my sweet.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.705
No, you couldn't have. Oh.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.275
Why couldn't
my wife be like that?

11:48.375 --> 11:51.845
Perhaps because you made
this decision in spite of her.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.547
Bob, will you take
a picture of us?

11:54.647 --> 11:55.749
Sure.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.650
When we get our
first mansion,

11:57.751 --> 11:59.787
this photo will go
above the fireplace.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.157
Everyone say, "money."

12:04.257 --> 12:07.260
Money!

12:08.595 --> 12:10.063
Would you like me to take
one of you, Mr. Wheeler?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.398
We could Photoshop
your wife in later.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.465
I'm good.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.400
This is a momentous occasion.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.401
I insist.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.369
Please don't.
Cheese.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.840
Who's ready for Red Lobster?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.374
We are!
We are!

12:24.677 --> 12:25.712
Going out
to dinner, huh?

12:25.813 --> 12:27.948
Of course. It is a celebration.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.516
That's nice. Enjoy.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.319
We will.
It is Shrimpfest.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.055
You guys have
an amazing father.

12:35.155 --> 12:38.225
I wouldn't have done this
with anybody else.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.894
Good talk.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.377
Mr. Wheeler, would you
like to come with us?

12:57.477 --> 12:58.578
You go ahead.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.114
I want to kick
the tires on this place.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.449
Children,
go to the car.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.951
I will be
right there.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.185
I will text you the picture.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.487
I don't want it.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.725
Mr. Wheeler...

13:12.826 --> 13:15.095
Abishola will
understand, in time.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.263
Will she?

13:17.164 --> 13:19.867
Tiwa was very angry
when I moved us to Detroit.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.668
She did not want
to leave home,

13:21.768 --> 13:25.405
but I knew it would be better
for our family in the long run.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.441
And look at her now,
eating shellfish at the mall.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.543
It is a dream come true.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.147
Yours will come true, too,
my friend.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.216
And your wife
will be very happy.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.717
Thanks, pal.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.586
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.188
For everything.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.859
Who's ready for
Cheddar Bay Biscuits?

13:49.662 --> 13:50.898
All right.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.541
That is a nice picture.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.954
Can't decide if I'm ashamed
of her or jealous of her.

14:14.054 --> 14:17.857
With Kemi, I've learned
that it can be both.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.294
It's the husband.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.629
Boo.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.432
He's just asking
where the remote is.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.767
He's probably
just sitting on it.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.437
Yep, he was sitting on it.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.007
How have you been married
for so long?

14:34.107 --> 14:36.944
Well, we both choose
to stay married.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.612
Mm-mm.
It cannot be that simple.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.814
Actually, honey, it is.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.951
Bob lied to me.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.520
No, he was honest.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.157
He was an idiot,
but he was honest.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.325
So, you are defending him?

14:52.425 --> 14:53.893
Hell no.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.662
But I don't have
to live with him.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.731
You got two choices:

14:58.831 --> 15:01.969
you can deal with
this problem together,

15:02.069 --> 15:04.071
or you can go
the Kemi route.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.810
I love Bob.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.812
I don't want
to stifle his dreams.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.481
Good news, you didn't.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.084
There's something
wrong with me.

15:17.184 --> 15:19.186
Yeah, we saw.

15:19.286 --> 15:22.222
That guy was pawing me
like a blind man,

15:22.322 --> 15:24.724
but all I could think
about was Chukwuemeka.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.427
Aw, baby, you love him.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.163
No, I don't.
Well, how do you explain it?

15:31.631 --> 15:33.066
Oh, my God.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.535
I love him.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.104
To love.
To love.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.809
Now he can't find his glasses.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.577
Mm-mm-mm.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.020
Hey.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.422
Hey to yourself.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.889
You okay?

15:56.990 --> 16:00.060
No. I am very angry.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.095
And a little drunk.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.597
Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

16:05.698 --> 16:06.666
My feelings?

16:06.766 --> 16:08.835
I'm not some
teenage girl.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.837
I'm worried
about my family.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.072
I understand.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.473
Do you?
Yes.

16:13.573 --> 16:17.177
Honey, I would never, ever
put our family at risk.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.280
I don't regret what I did,

16:20.380 --> 16:23.016
but I want you be
as sure about it as I am.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.851
So, tell me how
to make that happen.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.419
Oh, it's very simple.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.654
Great. Name it.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.590
Build the most
successful sock empire

16:30.690 --> 16:31.691
the world has ever seen.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.360
That's it, huh?

16:33.460 --> 16:34.827
I'm serious.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.363
Do not fail.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.431
I won't.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.368
I love you.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.171
I love you, too.

16:48.975 --> 16:49.876
Tequila?

16:49.976 --> 16:51.511
Many shots.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.012
And you paid for it.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.054
Next customer, please.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.855
Hello.

17:04.724 --> 17:05.825
Hello.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.327
Welcome to CVS.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.497
I need my medicine.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.102
"Listen-Ex"?

17:15.202 --> 17:17.036
It's not a real prescription.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.238
I know that.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.672
It is written on a napkin.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.742
But if it were a drug,
I would gladly take it

17:22.842 --> 17:24.977
so I could be
a better listener for you.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.415
Oh, Listen-Ex.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.916
That is very clever.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.520
Does this medication
have any side effects?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.355
Yes, always being there for you

17:35.455 --> 17:37.023
when you need
somebody to talk to.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.891
My Kemi.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.460
My Chukwuemeka.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.665
You know, I go on a break
in ten minutes.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.267
Would you like to go somewhere

17:47.367 --> 17:48.935
where you can talk
and I can listen?

17:51.271 --> 17:53.806
I do not want to talk at all.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.343
I love this man!
