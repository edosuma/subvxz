¶ ¶

00:17.718 --> 00:20.319
ANDY BASSICH: FREEZE UP LOOKS
LIKE IT HAPPENED PRETTY GOOD.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.654
IT'S REALLY LOW THIS YEAR.

00:22.757 --> 00:26.759
IF THE ICE ISN'T TOO BAD,
I MIGHT TRY AND SEE IF I CAN'T

00:26.861 --> 00:29.695
GET A TRAIL PUT
IN ACROSS THE RIVER.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.797
THE QUICKER I CAN GET
A TRAIL ACROSS THE RIVER,

00:31.899 --> 00:33.532
THAT'S GONNA OPEN
UP ALL THAT COUNTRY OUT

00:33.634 --> 00:35.634
THERE UPRIVER, DOWNRIVER.

00:35.870 --> 00:36.935
IT'S GONNA OPEN UP TRAPPING.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.570
IT'S GONNA OPEN
UP HAULING WOOD IN.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.006
IT'S GONNA OPEN UP LOGGING.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.343
A BIG PART OF MY WORLD IS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT RIVER

00:44.545 --> 00:46.712
AND I NEED TO, I
NEED TO GET OVER THERE.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.213
IT'S KIND OF
DICEY RIGHT NOW.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.749
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
UNTIL YOU GET OUT ON IT.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.951
THERE COULD BE PLACES
WHERE THERE'S HOLES WHERE

00:53.053 --> 00:55.554
IT'S VERY THIN, YOU COULD
JUST BUST RIGHT THROUGH IT.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.589
YOU BREAK THROUGH THE ICE,
THE SECOND YOU GO THROUGH THAT

00:57.691 --> 01:00.793
CURRENT TAKES
YA, YOU'RE DEAD.

01:04.865 --> 01:11.036
<i>¶ [THEME MUSIC PLAYS] ¶</i>

01:24.985 --> 01:27.019
COME ON, BOYS.

01:27.121 --> 01:30.322
I'M REALLY ANXIOUS
TO GET MY DOGS OUT.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.324
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
MUCH SNOW THIS YEAR,

01:32.426 --> 01:33.659
AND WITHOUT THE SNOW,

01:33.761 --> 01:35.794
I'M REALLY
LANDLOCKED IN RIGHT HERE.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.095
WHO'S THE GUINEA PIG HERE?

01:37.198 --> 01:38.263
WHO WANTS TO GO OUT FRONT?

01:38.365 --> 01:39.331
'CAUSE I DON'T.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.499
YOU WANNA GO OUT FRONT, BERG?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.534
WE'LL FIND OUT IF
THIS ICE IS THICK ENOUGH.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.339
THIS YEAR, THE YUKON
RIVER FROZE UP VERY LOW,

01:47.641 --> 01:50.209
BUT YET STILL
VERY JUMBLED UP.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.613
WHEN YOU CHALLENGE THE,
UH, JUMBLE ICE EARLY ON,

01:54.815 --> 01:56.248
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET,

01:56.350 --> 01:58.417
SO THE REALLY SMART AND
PRUDENT THING TO DO IS TO

01:58.519 --> 02:02.354
ALWAYS WALK IT FIRST.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.157
I ALWAYS TAKE A BIG POLE
WITH ME IN CASE I BREAK THROUGH.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.493
I ALSO LIKE TAKING MY
DOGS WITH ME BECAUSE THEY

02:07.595 --> 02:09.795
HAVE EXCELLENT HEARING
AND EXCELLENT SENSES,

02:09.897 --> 02:11.497
AND IF THE
ICE IS REALLY THIN,

02:11.599 --> 02:15.133
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
GO THERE MOST OF THE TIME.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.505
DOGS SEEM TO THINK
IT'S PRETTY GOOD OUT THERE.

02:19.607 --> 02:23.208
OOH, THAT'S WHAT
SCARES THE (BLEEP) OUT OF ME.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.144
YOU STEP ON A
PIECE OF THIN ICE AND YOUR

02:26.247 --> 02:29.615
FOOT GOES
THROUGH A LITTLE BIT.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.386
BETWEEN THE DOGS AND MYSELF,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.555
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
FIND A TRAIL ACROSS THIS,

02:36.657 --> 02:39.725
BUT, UH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO BE
CAUTIOUS THE WHOLE WAY ACROSS.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.194
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHECK
EVERYTHING THE WHOLE WAY ACROSS.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.963
IT'S A LOT MORE SMALL,
CHUNKY ICE IN HERE.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.698
IT'S KIND OF
HOLLOW UNDERNEATH OF IT,

02:46.800 --> 02:49.701
SO IT'S A LITTLE DECEIVING.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.671
I'M JUST GONNA
CHECK EVERYWHERE I STEP.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.207
THE YUKON RIVER IS
SOMETIMES YOUR FRIEND,

02:55.309 --> 02:57.276
AND SOMETIMES
IT'S YOUR WORST ENEMY.

02:57.378 --> 03:00.412
EARLY IN THE YEAR WHEN THERE'S
ROUGH ICE, IT'S DAUNTING.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.416
THIS IS ALL NEW ICE.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.285
THIS IS
BLACK ICE RIGHT HERE.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.721
IT'S REALLY SMOOTH AND
REALLY DARK UNDERNEATH THERE.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.625
THAT'S BRAND NEW ICE.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.860
IT LOOKS
LIKE IT'S FROZE UP.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.129
I CAN'T TELL
HOW THICK IT IS.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.731
NOT, NOT THICK ENOUGH TO
CRACK IT, SO THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.302
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.704
YOU LOOK SECURE,
THERE'S JUMBLE ICE THERE,

03:26.407 --> 03:27.873
THERE'S JUMBLE ICE THERE.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.741
YOU THINK, OH, THIS
IS GOOD AND THEN YOU STEP

03:29.843 --> 03:32.644
AND BOOM, DOWN YOU GO.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.180
IT JUST PAYS
TO BE CAUTIOUS.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.449
FIRST TIME ACROSS
IS SLOW AND STEADY.

03:39.119 --> 03:42.387
PAYS TO BE THE
TURTLE NOT THE HARE.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.057
STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.126
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
THE PROBLEM ISN'T DYING.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.228
THE PROBLEM IS
FIGURING OUT HOW TO LIVE.

03:50.331 --> 03:54.032
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT DYING,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT NOT LIVING.

04:03.577 --> 04:08.880
¶ ¶

04:09.116 --> 04:10.682
WHAT THE HELL?

04:10.784 --> 04:14.486
AH, PIECES OF MY MOOSE HIDE.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.289
SOMETHING'S BEEN
FEEDING ON THIS.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.459
THESE PIECES OF HIDE,
I LEFT UP ON THIS PLATFORM IN

04:20.561 --> 04:22.561
ORDER TO KEEP
THEM FROM BAIT.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.063
THIS HAS NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.332
I NEED TO GO UP TO
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.671
AH, NOTHING'S EVER
GOT UP HERE BEFORE.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.379
OH, MAN.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.847
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.850
SOMETHING ACTUALLY GOT UP
HERE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.319
OH, THIS ISN'T GOOD.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.088
THIS CACHE HAS STOOD HERE
FOR 10 YEARS AND I'VE NEVER HAD

04:50.190 --> 04:52.391
ANYTHING GET UP ON IT BEFORE.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.026
THERE'S A LITTLE URINE THERE.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.194
THERE'S SOME SCAT.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.997
LUCKILY, ALL I HAD
HERE WAS BAIT AND ANTLERS,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.867
BUT A LOT OF TIMES, I
HAVE GOOD FOOD UP HERE.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.336
I PUT A WHOLE MOOSE UP HERE
IN THE FALL AFTER I KILL IT.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.304
I PUT CARIBOU UP HERE IN
THE WINTER WHEN I GET 'EM.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.074
AND I CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE OF
HAVING SOMETHING GET UP HERE

05:09.176 --> 05:11.376
AGAIN AND EATING UP GOOD MEAT.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.146
APPARENTLY, THIS
ISN'T SAFE ENOUGH.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.316
I'VE GOT SHEET METAL, PIECES
OF STOVEPIPE AROUND THE LEGS

05:18.419 --> 05:21.787
OF THE CACHE, SO THAT
ANIMALS CAN'T CLIMB UP ONTO IT.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.689
HOW'D ANYTHING GET UP THERE?

05:23.791 --> 05:26.458
THERE'S NO WAY ANYTHING
CLIMBED OVER THIS TIN.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.928
I MEAN, THERE'S FOUR FEET
OF SHEET METAL RIGHT THERE.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.096
THAT'S SLICK.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.798
ANIMALS CAN'T GET
A PURCHASE ON IT,

05:32.900 --> 05:34.299
THAT'S WHY I PUT IT THERE.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.535
THE ONLY OTHER
POSSIBILITY IS THAT IT

05:36.637 --> 05:39.004
GOT UP HERE
AND JUMPED ACROSS.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.642
WHEN I BUILT THIS MEAT
POLE, I RAN OUT OF STOVEPIPE.

05:44.044 --> 05:47.079
I GOT FOUR FEET ON
ALL THOSE LEGS, BUT HERE,

05:47.181 --> 05:49.514
I ONLY HAVE TWO FEET.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.317
LOOK AT THIS, CLAW MARKS.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.586
AND THAT'S
BIGGER THAN A MARTEN.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.621
THAT MUST BE THE WOLVERINE.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.757
I'VE HAD A WOLVERINE
AROUND THIS WINTER,

05:58.859 --> 06:01.793
AND I DIDN'T WANNA KILL IT,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT OFTEN

06:01.895 --> 06:04.029
YOU GET TO SEE A
WOLVERINE UP CLOSE.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.597
THEY'RE USUALLY
NOT THAT BOLD.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.433
I GOT TO
INVESTIGATE THIS CLOSER.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.602
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW
THE WOLVERINE GOT UP HERE.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.839
I CAN'T HAVE THE ANIMALS BEING
ABLE TO GET UP ON THIS CACHE.

06:14.408 --> 06:17.242
YES, IT WAS THE WOLVERINE.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.811
THERE ARE MORE CLAW MARKS
RIGHT ON THE METAL THERE.

06:20.047 --> 06:24.416
THAT WOLVERINE GOT OVER THAT
PIPE, CLIMBED RIGHT UP HERE,

06:24.518 --> 06:26.184
AND I CAN SEE RIGHT
THERE CLAW MARKS,

06:26.653 --> 06:29.688
AND IF HE JUMP RIGHT ACROSS,
I CAN SEE SOME MARKS RIGHT ON

06:29.790 --> 06:32.090
THAT CORNER OF THE
CACHE WHERE HE LANDED.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.993
THAT'S A HIGHLY
MOTIVATED WOLVERINE.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.394
THIS TIME I GOT LUCKY.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.563
ALL I LOST WAS SOME BAIT,
SOME SCRAPS, BUT SOMETIMES,

06:38.665 --> 06:40.599
I HAVE A LOT OF
FOOD ON THIS PLATFORM.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.468
SOMETIMES, I HAVE SEVERAL
MONTHS' FOOD STORED HERE.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.470
AND I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO BE ABLE TO GET UP THERE

06:45.572 --> 06:46.338
AND GET IT.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.372
I'VE GOT TO FIX THIS.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.708
I'VE GOT TO MAKE
IT MORE SECURE.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.443
I NEED TO PUT MORE
STOVEPIPE ON HERE.

06:51.545 --> 06:54.112
I DO HAVE A STOVE IN THE SOD
HOUSE I'M NOT USING RIGHT NOW.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.848
I COULD TAKE THAT STOVEPIPE.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.550
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO
FIX THIS RIGHT NOW THAN

06:58.652 --> 07:00.685
TO HAVE A STOVE IN THERE.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.856
JESSIE HOLMES: MAYBE I
DON'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY,

07:04.958 --> 07:07.225
BUT IT ALWAYS GOES
BACK TO THE DOGS NOT TO ME.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.295
IF I LIVE FOR THE
DOGS, THEY LIVE FOR ME.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.841
EEYORE.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.544
COME ON, BUDDY.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.312
YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME TODAY, YEAH,

07:27.414 --> 07:29.214
WE'RE GOING ON A BIG TRIP.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.316
I'M HEADING UP TO MINTO.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.785
I WAS JUST UP THERE
LAST WEEK RACING A DOG RACE.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.088
IT'S A RACE WHERE
WE SPEND OVERNIGHT.

07:37.191 --> 07:39.257
I HAD A DOG THAT
WAS PRETTY SORE THERE.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.593
SO, I, UH, LEFT
HIM WITH MY FRIEND.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.562
I WAS GONNA DRIVE UP
THERE AND GO BACK AND GET HIM,

07:43.664 --> 07:46.064
BUT IT'S 360-MILE DRIVE.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.900
THAT'S A LOT OF GAS AND I
GOT DOGS THAT NEED TO BE RUN,

07:49.336 --> 07:51.536
AND MINTO IS A
STRAIGHT DASH FROM HERE,

07:52.206 --> 07:54.306
RIGHT ACROSS
THE FLATS 53 MILES.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.708
SO, I'M GONNA GO UP HERE
AND GET HIM BY A DOG TEAM.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.946
THERE'S ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT
OF APPREHENSION THAT GOES INTO

08:01.048 --> 08:02.447
RUNNING A BIG TEAM OF DOGS.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.249
ANYTHING COULD
HAPPEN OUT THERE.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.585
IT'S A LOT OF POWER
FOR ONE MAN TO HANDLE.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.054
BUT THAT'S WHERE
THE EXHILARATION

08:09.156 --> 08:10.956
AND THE ADVENTURE,
EXCITEMENT COMES IN.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.425
GOOD BOYS, GOOD BOYS.

08:13.527 --> 08:16.261
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, READY?

08:17.130 --> 08:18.730
HIKE.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.569
GOOD BOYS, STRAIGHT
AHEAD, STRAIGHT AHEAD,

08:24.805 --> 08:26.838
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

08:32.646 --> 08:33.645
GOOD BOYS, ALL RIGHT.

08:33.747 --> 08:34.779
THERE YOU GO.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.748
EVERYBODY THINKS DOG
MUSHING'S JUST HOOKING UP DOGS

08:36.850 --> 08:41.152
AND GOING DOWN THE TRAIL
AND MUSHING AND A GEE AND A HAW

08:41.255 --> 08:43.722
AND A YIPPIE-TIE-YAY
BUT, REALLY YOU GOT TO

08:43.824 --> 08:45.323
BE A SPORT PSYCHOLOGIST.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.592
YOU GOT TO BE A PHYSICAL
THERAPIST FOR THESE DOGS.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.960
YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHEN THEY'RE HURT,

08:49.062 --> 08:51.062
YOU GOT TO KNOW HOW TO
GET 'EM BACK IN THE TEAM.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.397
STRAIGHT UP,
STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT UP,

08:52.499 --> 08:53.665
STRAIGHT AHEAD,
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.534
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE MANAGING
A HIGH-GRADE SPORTS TEAM.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.470
THIS IS LIKE THE
CHICAGO BULLS TO ME.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.238
THESE DOGS
CAN BE CHAMPIONS.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.173
IT'S WHAT I DO WITH THEM
THAT MAKES THEM CHAMPIONS.

09:04.878 --> 09:11.216
EASY, WHOA, WHOA, STOP.

09:12.953 --> 09:16.955
STAY, GOOD DOGS.

09:17.824 --> 09:21.026
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS 30 MILES
IN ON THE TRAIL, ACTUALLY 32.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.130
JUST TURNED
OFF THE MAIN TRAIL.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.899
FROM HERE ON, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA COME INTO.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.503
PROBABLY A LOT OF
DRIFTING SNOW, SOFT TRAIL.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.438
SO, I'M GONNA STOP AND
GIVE THE DOGS A LITTLE REST,

09:33.540 --> 09:34.572
SOME SNACK.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.042
THEY'RE EXCITED STILL,
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU WANNA

09:37.144 --> 09:40.045
SEE 32 MILES IN.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.682
YOU CAN GIVE A DOG A PAT ON
THE HEAD OR YOU COULD GIVE IT

09:43.784 --> 09:46.184
A STEAK, AND THEN THEY
REALLY KNOW YOU APPRECIATE IT.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.386
GOOD JOB, BASIN.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.155
MAMMOTH, MEGA.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.356
LITTLE BIT OF STEAK.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.791
THEY COULD
USE A LITTLE BREAK,

09:52.893 --> 09:54.259
'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT
TO BE A HARD PUSH,

09:54.361 --> 09:56.461
AND WE'RE GONNA PUSH TO
MAKE IT TO MINTO BEFORE DARK,

09:56.563 --> 09:59.698
GET OUR DOG, TURN AROUND,
GO BACK, CAMP SOMEWHERE,

09:59.800 --> 10:02.834
SHOOT STRAIGHT BACK TOMORROW.

10:03.036 --> 10:06.604
OH YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

10:09.576 --> 10:12.344
23 MILES TO GO TO
PICK UP COMANCHE.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.382
SUE AIKENS: I HAVE NO DESIRE
TO LIVE A NINE-TO-FIVE LIFE.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.086
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO
HAVE THE BUSINESS KEEP ME

10:21.188 --> 10:22.887
FROM PLAYING CHECKERS.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.666
I'M CLEANING
THE INCINERATOR.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.434
THERE'S NO WAY TO
DO IT WITHOUT GETTING

10:36.536 --> 10:39.237
YOUR HANDS DIRTY.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.207
PEOPLE ASK ME, HOW
DO YOU GET SO DIRTY, MAN?

10:42.809 --> 10:46.244
AND IT'S LIKE,
LOOK, THAT'S HOW.

10:47.047 --> 10:50.715
NOT EVERY JOB IS THIS COLOR.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.450
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA
GO OUT AND DO THE GARDENING,

10:52.552 --> 10:53.485
YOU'RE GONNA GET DIRTY.

10:53.587 --> 10:55.720
DIFFERENCE IS YOU
CAN JUMP IN A SHOWER,

10:55.822 --> 10:58.256
YOU CAN GO SWIMMING AT THE
POOL, YOU CAN GO TO THE SPA.

10:58.692 --> 10:59.891
I DON'T HAVE A SPA.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.059
I DON'T HAVE A HOT TUB.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.328
I HAVE RUNNING WATER,
A COUPLE OF MONTHS A YEAR.

11:04.464 --> 11:08.767
I GIVE MYSELF 240 TO 300
GALLONS OF WATER TO LAST THE

11:08.869 --> 11:11.269
NINE-TEN MONTHS BEFORE
I'LL HAVE CLEAN WATER,

11:11.371 --> 11:12.404
RUNNING WATER AGAIN.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.605
THAT'S NOT A LOT.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.607
THAT'S ROUGHLY A
GALLON OR LESS A DAY.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.543
THAT'S FOR DRINKING,
COOKING, CLEANING, EVERYTHING.

11:18.645 --> 11:19.778
SO, HOW DO I FIX THAT?

11:19.913 --> 11:22.047
HOW DO I GET MYSELF CLEAN
WITH A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF WATER?

11:22.682 --> 11:25.050
AND I'M THINKING HEAT, SWEAT.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.552
MAKE MY BODY CLEAN ITSELF.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.888
MAKE IT DETOX.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.423
A SAUNA.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.590
WHAT IS A SAUNA?

11:32.692 --> 11:36.094
IT'S A BUILDING YOU GO
INTO AND THE EXTREME HEAT WILL

11:36.196 --> 11:38.029
CAUSE YOU TO SWEAT.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.597
THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.400
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF WATER,
THAT WAY, I CAN COME OUT HERE,

11:42.502 --> 11:46.638
GRAB SNOW, THROW IT ON
IT GOES AND YOU'RE NOT USING

11:46.740 --> 11:49.741
10 GALLONS,
YOU'RE USING A HANDFUL.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.277
SO, HOW DO I DO THAT?

11:52.379 --> 11:55.380
THIS IS MY SPARE
PARTS DIVISION.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.950
I WANNA LOOK, SEE WHAT
I'VE GOT LAYING AROUND.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.555
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IT
LOOKS LIKE, IT'S A STEP.

12:04.458 --> 12:05.390
MAYBE I CAN USE THAT.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.158
THERE'S A LITTLE TABLE.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.361
I'VE GOT A LITTLE BURN BARREL
HERE, MAYBE I CAN USE THAT.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.132
THIS LITTLE DUDE HERE,

12:14.234 --> 12:15.934
MAYBE I CAN BUILD
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS.

12:16.036 --> 12:19.571
IT'S ALL METAL, BUT
I'VE GOT, I CAN MAKE A FLOOR.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.639
I'VE GOT FOAM INSULATION.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.174
I MIGHT HAVE SOME PLYWOOD.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.276
I DON'T WANNA BUILD A
PERMANENT STRUCTURE I WANNA

12:25.378 --> 12:28.179
MAKE WHATEVER I MAKE IN
SUCH A WAY THAT I CAN TAKE

12:28.281 --> 12:30.849
IT APART AND USE THOSE
MATERIALS FOR ANOTHER PROJECT.

12:30.951 --> 12:31.683
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.151
THIS IS A HEAVY BEAST.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.853
IT NEEDS TO BE MOVED.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.155
THAT'S PRETTY FAR AWAY
FROM WHERE I LIVE.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.424
IF IT'S 50 BELOW,
PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE TOO

12:39.526 --> 12:42.360
INTO GOING THAT FAR AND
WALKING BACK HOME WITH WET HAIR.

12:42.662 --> 12:46.097
I DID NOT USE MY TIME
WISELY THIS SUMMER WHEN I

12:46.199 --> 12:49.134
HAD THE LOADER UP
AND RUNNING TO MOVE THAT

12:49.236 --> 12:51.169
BIG SLED OUT OF THE WAY.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.207
GAME PLAN IS GET
THE BOBCAT AND TRY.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.076
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.

13:01.681 --> 13:02.981
(BLEEP).

13:03.083 --> 13:05.416
NOT BUDGING IT MUCH.

13:23.570 --> 13:27.906
SUE AIKENS: (BLEEP),
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

13:36.917 --> 13:40.218
THIS IS GONNA BE THE
FRAMEWORK FOR THE NEW SAUNA.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.520
WHY DID I JUST RUN
AROUND AND POKE AT IT LIKE

13:42.622 --> 13:45.757
YOU'RE POKING A BEAR?

13:45.859 --> 13:50.128
THIS THING IS SOLID
U.S. FREAKING STEEL.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.597
IT IS A
HEAVY SON OF A BITCH,

13:52.699 --> 13:56.201
WELL OVER WHAT THIS
MACHINE IS BUILT TO DO.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.703
BUT IT'S WHAT I HAVE.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.105
SO, I WANNA SEE,
CAN I MOVE IT AT ALL?

14:01.208 --> 14:04.709
YEAH, I CAN TILT IT AND
JUST GET A COUPLE INCHES.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.278
IT'S ON RUNNERS,
IT MAY SLIDE.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.914
FIRST THING'S
FIRST, GRAB A SHOVEL,

14:10.016 --> 14:13.952
GET THIS SNOW OUT OF
HERE, BACK IT UP, HOOK IT UP,

14:14.054 --> 14:16.187
HOPEFULLY, WE'LL GO.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.391
MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT, BUT
YOU START ADDING UP THE WEIGHT

14:20.494 --> 14:24.062
OF THE SNOW, ANY POUNDAGE I
CAN GET OFF OF THIS IS GONNA

14:24.164 --> 14:26.898
HELP LITTLE BETSY OVER THERE.

14:29.803 --> 14:32.570
LET'S GET IT DONE, TRY IT.

14:42.148 --> 14:45.483
ALL RIGHT,
I TIGHTENED IT UP.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.286
YOU KNOW IT'S GO
OR GLOW TIME NOW.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.522
THAT IS ONE HEAVY AS HELL
TRAILER AND IT'S WAY OVER WHAT

14:50.624 --> 14:52.857
THE BOBCAT'S RATED FOR.

14:53.293 --> 14:56.628
I CAN'T BREAK THE ONLY
WINTER MACHINE I'VE GOT.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.931
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A
LITTLE BIT OF COERCION.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.419
THIS BABY IS BIG.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.689
IT'S GONNA FILL UP WITH
SNOW AND JUST BE THIS BEHEMOTH,

15:24.791 --> 15:27.125
THAT'S GONNA CREATE A DRIFT.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.995
SO, PLACEMENT IS EVERYTHING.

15:38.572 --> 15:41.205
IT'S NOT WHAT I
WOULD CALL LEVEL,

15:41.308 --> 15:43.274
BUT I DON'T THINK I'M
GONNA GET A PARKING TICKET,

15:43.376 --> 15:45.944
I THINK I'LL LET MYSELF OFF.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.419
I GOT A FEW
LOOSE MEASUREMENTS,

15:54.521 --> 15:56.487
LETS ME KNOW
ABOUT THE SIZE THAT I,

15:56.590 --> 15:58.523
OF STUFF I NEED
TO GO LOOK FOR.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.326
SO, I'VE GOT A
FRAMEWORK OF THE IDEA,

16:01.428 --> 16:02.994
NOW I NEED TO GET
THE MEAT AND POTATOES.

16:03.096 --> 16:06.130
I'LL START LOOKING
TOMORROW FOR PIECES AND PARTS.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.041
JESSIE HOLMES: IT'S
VERY REWARDING TO BE LIVING A

16:17.143 --> 16:19.677
UNIQUE LIFESTYLE,
DOGS DEPENDING ON ME,

16:19.913 --> 16:21.245
ME DEPENDING ON THE DOGS.

16:21.348 --> 16:24.148
IT'S A VERY
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.958
<i>NARRATOR: JESSIE IS</i>
<i>ON A 53-MILE TREK TO THE</i>

16:34.060 --> 16:36.260
<i>TOWN OF MINTO,</i>
<i>TO RETRIEVE HIS SLED DOG,</i>

16:36.363 --> 16:38.763
<i>COMANCHE FROM A FRIEND.</i>

16:38.999 --> 16:41.199
<i>BUT CONDITIONS ON</i>
<i>THE TRAIL ARE DANGEROUS,</i>

16:41.301 --> 16:43.501
<i>AND HE CAN'T RISK</i>
<i>INJURING HIMSELF OR ANY</i>

16:43.603 --> 16:46.337
<i>MEMBER OF HIS DOG TEAM.</i>

16:48.875 --> 16:49.974
JESSIE HOLMES: THE
CONDITIONS AND THE GOING

16:50.076 --> 16:52.810
ARE PRETTY TOUGH.

16:52.912 --> 16:55.980
COUPLE OF THE YOUNGER DOGS
ARE LOOKING A LITTLE TIRED,

16:56.816 --> 16:58.549
UH, PUNCHING
THROUGH ALL THIS SNOW.

16:58.652 --> 17:01.386
I MIGHT HAVE TO PULL OVER
AND GIVE THE DOGS A LITTLE REST.

17:01.788 --> 17:07.025
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

17:07.394 --> 17:10.428
GOOD BOYS.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.464
YOU OKAY, BUDDY?

17:13.566 --> 17:16.434
OKAY?

17:16.536 --> 17:21.339
A LITTLE SWOLLEN.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.108
IT'S OKAY, YEAH.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.477
IT'S LOOKING LIKE
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A

17:26.579 --> 17:27.712
LOOK AT MY DOG, TITAN.

17:27.814 --> 17:28.746
HE'S HOLDING HIS LEG UP.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.148
GOOD BOY, IT'S OKAY.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.482
IT'S OKAY.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.184
HE'S, UH, LIMPING
OVER HERE ON HIS LEFT SIDE.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.686
I THINK HE MIGHT
HAVE A SORE WRIST.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.020
JUST WANTED TO
GET HIM OUT OF THE TEAM

17:36.122 --> 17:37.488
AND MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.024
IT'S OKAY, BUDDY, STAY.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.694
AS SOON AS I CAN FIND A
GOOD PLACE TO HAVE A FIRE,

17:42.796 --> 17:45.296
I'M GONNA STOP, GIVE THE
DOGS A GOOD NIGHT'S REST,

17:45.398 --> 17:46.931
AND THEN MAKE MY
WAY INTO MINTO TO GET

17:47.033 --> 17:48.633
COMANCHE IN THE MORNING.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.601
ALL RIGHT, ZEUS,
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

17:50.704 --> 17:55.606
HUP, EASY, HEY,
STOP IT, NO, NO.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.076
HEY, STAY.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.245
HE'S NOT TOO EXCITED
ABOUT RIDING IN THE SLED.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.314
HE WANTS TO BE OUT THERE
PULLING WITH HIS BUDDIES,

18:03.416 --> 18:06.050
BUT THAT'S WHAT KEEPING
A DOG TEAM TOGETHER IS,

18:06.152 --> 18:08.319
IS HAVING AN EYE
FOR THOSE THINGS.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.488
STRAIGHT AHEAD,
GOOD, STRAIGHT AHEAD.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.297
STRAIGHT AHEAD,
ZEUS, GOOD BOY.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.432
GOOD BOY, STRAIGHT UP,
STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT UP.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.135
WHOA, GOOD BOY.

18:25.872 --> 18:30.808
THIS IS KIND OF A SHORTER
RUN FOR MY A-TEAM DOGS IN HERE.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.077
BUT YOU GOT TO PLAY THE
WEAKEST DOG IN YOUR TEAM.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.379
THAT'S WHAT YOU
PACE YOUR TEAM TO.

18:36.850 --> 18:39.851
WHAT I DO HERE IS I
OSCILLATE THE WRIST AND THAT

18:39.953 --> 18:43.187
HELPS TO PULL THE SWELLING AND
THE FLUID AWAY FROM THAT JOINT.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.089
IT'S HARD TO AVOID
THIS KIND OF STUFF WITH,

18:45.191 --> 18:47.158
IF YOU KNOW YOUR
DOGS REALLY WELL,

18:47.260 --> 18:49.327
YOU CAN SPOT
THIS OUT RIGHT AWAY.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.196
I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND MUSHING AND WHAT

18:52.298 --> 18:56.367
REALLY IT TAKES, YOU KNOW,
AND REQUIRES TO BE GOOD AT IT.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.170
IT TAKES A LOT OF CARE.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.105
HERE, HAVE SOME STRAW.

19:01.207 --> 19:02.340
THERE YOU GO.

19:02.475 --> 19:06.110
THE MUSHER BASICALLY HAS TO
BE TIRELESS HIMSELF BECAUSE

19:06.212 --> 19:08.279
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE
DOGS WHENEVER WE GET TO CAMP.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.881
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.016
I NEVER EAT BEFORE MY DOGS.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.818
I NEVER TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF UNTIL THE DOGS

19:13.920 --> 19:16.187
ARE ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.761
TOMORROW'S
GONNA BE A BIG PUSH.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.764
WE GOT 13 MILES
INTO MINTO TO MAKE IT.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.634
WE GOT A LONG WAYS
TO MAKE IT BACK TO NENANA,

19:29.736 --> 19:32.303
SO TOMORROW'S GONNA BE A DAY
THAT WE'RE ALL GONNA NEED OUR

19:32.405 --> 19:34.272
REST FOR, SO I'M
GLAD I MADE THE CALL

19:34.374 --> 19:35.640
AND PULLED OVER EARLY.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.108
IT'S WHAT'S
BEST FOR MY DOGS AND

19:37.210 --> 19:39.010
THAT'S WHAT
MATTERS THE MOST.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.781
GLENN VILLENEUVE: FOR ME
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE BEING IN

19:43.883 --> 19:45.416
THE MOUNTAINS, ON A LAKE.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.218
THAT'S THE IDEAL HABITAT.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.253
EVERY ANIMALS GOT ITS
IDEAL HABITAT, THIS IS MINE,

19:49.355 --> 19:51.722
RIGHT HERE.

19:58.164 --> 20:01.465
RIGHT HERE, THE WOLVERINE
GOT INTO THESE ANTLERS.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.902
HE'S BEEN
CHEWING THESE ALL UP.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.471
<i>NARRATOR: AFTER DISCOVERING</i>
<i>A WOLVERINE HAS TAMPERED WITH</i>

20:07.574 --> 20:10.775
<i>HIS MEAT SUPPLY, GLENN</i>
<i>WILL USE STOVEPIPE FROM</i>

20:10.877 --> 20:13.244
<i>HIS SOD HOUSE TO</i>
<i>SECURE HIS MEAT POLE AND</i>

20:13.346 --> 20:15.313
<i>PROTECT HIS</i>
<i>CAMP FROM SCAVENGERS.</i>

20:16.716 --> 20:18.382
GLENN VILLENEUVE: AND
YOU THINK ABOUT A LITTLE

20:18.484 --> 20:22.386
30-POUND ANIMAL,
EATING UP POUNDS OF ANTLER.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.956
SOMETIMES, I HAVE A LOT
OF FOOD ON THIS PLATFORM.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.124
SOMETIMES, I HAVE
SEVERAL MONTHS' FOOD STORED,

20:27.227 --> 20:29.093
AND I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO BE ABLE TO GET UP THERE

20:29.195 --> 20:31.696
AND GET IT.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.531
I JUST HAVE TO
SECURE THIS CACHE,

20:33.633 --> 20:35.032
PUT SOME MORE
STOVEPIPE AROUND THE POLE,

20:35.134 --> 20:36.834
SO HE CAN'T CLIMB UP IT.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.008
YOU HAVE TO GET SHEET
METAL WHEREVER YOU CAN

20:44.110 --> 20:45.209
FIND IT OUT HERE.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.477
THIS IS THE
ONLY METAL I REALLY CAN

20:46.579 --> 20:48.713
THINK OF THAT I HAVE.

20:48.815 --> 20:52.884
IF I CAN GET THIS APART, THEN
I CAN PUT IT AROUND THAT POLE.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.286
IT'S STARTING TO COME.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.687
IT'S GONNA,
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.656
LOOK AT THAT.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.292
YES!

21:04.697 --> 21:07.164
THERE, THAT'S
WHAT I WANTED.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.699
THERE.

21:08.902 --> 21:10.534
NOW, I CAN TAKE
THIS PIECE OF METAL,

21:10.637 --> 21:12.703
AND I CAN WRAP IT AROUND
THE TREE THAT SUPPORTS MY

21:12.805 --> 21:16.440
MEAT POLE TO EXTEND THE
METAL I HAVE THERE,

21:16.743 --> 21:18.743
SO THE WOLVERINE
CAN'T CLIMB OVER IT.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.711
I DON'T MIND TRAPPING THE
ANIMALS WHEN I NEED THE FUR,

21:20.813 --> 21:22.280
BUT WHEN I DON'T NEED
THE FUR, THERE'S NO REASON

21:22.382 --> 21:23.281
TO KILL A WOLVERINE.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.516
THEY CERTAINLY DON'T
POSE ANY DANGER TO ME.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.052
THEY CAN CAUSE A FEW PROBLEMS,
THEY CAN GET INTO YOUR FOOD,

21:28.154 --> 21:30.755
BUT I CAN SOLVE
THAT PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.

21:40.566 --> 21:46.270
¶ ¶

21:46.372 --> 21:48.839
I JUST NEED TO PUT
SOME MORE METAL HERE,

21:48.942 --> 21:50.708
THEN THE WOLVERINE WON'T
BE ABLE TO CLIMB OVER IT.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.844
HE WAS ABLE TO REACH OVER
THIS AND GET A GRIP UP HERE,

21:53.947 --> 21:56.814
EITHER HERE OR HERE,
AND GET FURTHER UP THE POLES,

21:57.583 --> 22:00.751
BUT IF I PUT A
LONGER SECTION OF METAL,

22:00.853 --> 22:03.454
IT'S GONNA STOP HIM.

22:13.366 --> 22:16.233
LOOKING PRETTY GOOD.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.403
THIS IS GONNA
MAKE IT MUCH HARDER FOR A

22:19.505 --> 22:22.006
WOLVERINE TO GET UP HERE.

22:23.609 --> 22:25.810
WITH THAT
MUCH METAL TO CROSS,

22:25.912 --> 22:28.312
I DON'T SEE HOW ONE
CAN POSSIBLY REACH ACROSS IT.

22:32.218 --> 22:34.285
THERE, PROBLEM SOLVED.

22:35.288 --> 22:36.754
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
WOLVERINE'S GONNA GET

22:36.856 --> 22:39.123
OVER ALL THAT METAL.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.061
ANDY BASSICH: YOU NEVER
KNOW WHAT LIFE THROWS AT YOU.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.530
I PRETTY MUCH LIVE
DAY-TO-DAY, AND MONTH-TO-MONTH,

22:46.766 --> 22:47.898
AND YEAR-TO-YEAR.

22:48.001 --> 22:49.734
I'M CONFIDENT
THAT I'LL ADAPT TO WHATEVER

22:49.836 --> 22:52.570
SITUATION THAT COMES MY WAY.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.007
COME ON, BUDDY.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.109
LET'S GO, LET'S
GO, STRAIGHT AHEAD.

22:59.345 --> 23:01.512
ATTA BOY,
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.015
<i>NARRATOR: TO ACCESS KEY</i>
<i>RESOURCES FOR THE REMAINDER</i>

23:04.117 --> 23:06.650
<i>OF WINTER, ANDY MUST</i>
<i>CARVE OUT A TRAIL ACROSS</i>

23:06.753 --> 23:08.552
<i>THE FROZEN YUKON RIVER.</i>

23:09.288 --> 23:11.756
<i>BUT LATE FREEZE</i>
<i>UP AND LOW SNOWFALL HAVE</i>

23:11.858 --> 23:14.091
<i>DELAYED THE COMPLETION</i>
<i>OF THIS CRUCIAL TASK.</i>

23:15.595 --> 23:17.561
ANDY BASSICH: I'M PRETTY
MUCH PINNED IN UNTIL THE YUKON

23:17.663 --> 23:20.031
RIVER IS SAFE TO TRAVEL,
WHETHER IT BE IN THE

23:20.133 --> 23:21.966
SUMMERTIME OR
IN THE WINTERTIME.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.770
I'M 100% DEPENDENT ON THAT
RIVER FOR MY TRANSPORTATION.

23:26.472 --> 23:29.607
IT'S BASICALLY MY, UH, I-95.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.010
THE IMPORTANT THING FOR ME
IS TO GET TRAILS IN ACROSS

23:33.112 --> 23:35.246
THAT YUKON RIVER
AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.548
THE DOWNSIDE TO THAT IS
THAT'S USUALLY WHEN IT'S IN ITS

23:37.650 --> 23:39.717
ROUGHEST CONDITION,
RIGHT AFTER FREEZE UP.

23:41.054 --> 23:42.153
WE'RE ALMOST THERE,

23:42.255 --> 23:44.688
BUT THE WORST
PART'S AHEAD OF US, BOYS.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.690
THIS LOOKS REALLY WET.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.160
THIS PART OF THE RIVER HERE,
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SEEING FROM

23:49.262 --> 23:51.295
UP ON TOP MY, UH, PORCH.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.731
THIS WAS THE PART THAT I
DIDN'T REALLY LIKE LOOKING AT.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.933
IT, IT'S JUST THE
WRONG COLOR OF ICE.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.501
I CAN TELL
IT'S ALL NEW ICE.

23:57.603 --> 24:00.504
THERE'S A LOT OF
WATER MIXED IN WITH IT,

24:00.606 --> 24:03.441
SO I THINK I'M GONNA GO
BACK, GET MY SNOW MACHINE.

24:03.543 --> 24:07.178
I'VE ONLY GOT ANOTHER 100,
150 YARDS OF RIVER TO CROSS,

24:07.280 --> 24:10.414
BUT THAT LAST 150 YARDS COULD
BE THE MOST DANGEROUS PART.

24:13.719 --> 24:14.985
THE DOGS DON'T LIKE IT.

24:15.088 --> 24:16.520
THEY'RE ALL
STAYING BEHIND ME HERE.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.656
THEY DON'T WANNA, THEY DON'T
WANNA BE THE FIRST TO CROSS,

24:18.758 --> 24:21.025
SO THAT'S A GOOD INDICATOR
THAT MAYBE IT'S GOOD TO BE

24:21.127 --> 24:23.461
EXTRA CAUTIOUS RIGHT HERE.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.931
YOU GUYS ARE GOOD BOYS.

24:29.402 --> 24:32.970
I'LL BRING THE SNOW
MACHINE UP, AND FIND MY TRAIL.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.248
I GOT A ROPE WITH ME.

24:44.383 --> 24:47.785
I CAN WALK OUT WITH A ROPE
IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS.

24:47.887 --> 24:51.422
THAT SNOW
MACHINE WILL HOLD ME.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.634
OH, OH...

25:10.843 --> 25:12.543
OH, YEAH!

25:20.686 --> 25:22.653
IT'S DEEP.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.089
THAT'S A KILLER
HOLE RIGHT THERE.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.091
THAT'S THE
CURRENT RIGHT THERE,

25:27.193 --> 25:28.259
BUBBLING UP THROUGH THERE.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.427
IT'S FAST ENOUGH THAT
IT'LL JUST TAKE YOU AWAY.

25:30.530 --> 25:33.264
YOU CAN JUST BE WALKING ALONG,
THINKING YOU'RE REALLY GOOD,

25:33.566 --> 25:36.534
AND THEN, BOOM,
YOU'RE THROUGH.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.303
AND IF YOU GO THROUGH THERE,
THE ICE ON THE YUKON RIVER,

25:39.405 --> 25:42.239
YOU INSTANTLY WEIGH MORE
THAN YOU NORMALLY WOULD.

25:42.341 --> 25:45.176
SO, EVEN A VERY STRONG
ATHLETIC PERSON HAS A VERY

25:45.278 --> 25:48.179
DIFFICULT TIME PULLING
THEMSELF OUT OF THE YUKON.

25:48.381 --> 25:51.949
THE OTHER FACTOR IS THAT WATER
IS PROBABLY ABOUT 30 DEGREES,

25:52.051 --> 25:54.351
SO THE SECOND
YOU HIT THAT WATER,

25:54.453 --> 25:55.986
ALL YOU CAN DO IS EXHALE.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.222
YOU CAN'T EVEN
INHALE, IT'S SO COLD.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.591
HEY, YOU GUYS, YOU
GUYS COME OVER THIS WAY.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.692
STAY AWAY FROM THAT.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.060
THAT LOOKS LIKE OPEN WATER.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.896
LITTLE BIT OF
A DETOUR HERE.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.766
GETTING TO SOME
BAD ICE RIGHT HERE.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.235
GAMBO, STAY AWAY
FROM THAT, BUDDY.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.637
THAT HOLE RIGHT
THERE, THAT'S DEATH.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.372
YOU FALL IN
THAT, YOU'RE GONE.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.741
SO, WE WANNA
STAY AWAY FROM THAT.

26:18.211 --> 26:19.843
I DON'T EVEN LIKE
STANDING RIGHT HERE.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.479
I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.281
PUP, PUP, PUP, PUP!

26:24.383 --> 26:25.449
HEY, HEY, COME HERE!

26:25.551 --> 26:27.218
COME, PUPPY, PUPPY, PUPPY!

26:27.320 --> 26:28.886
COME HERE,
COME HERE, COME ON!

26:28.988 --> 26:30.788
PUP, PUP, PUP,
PUP, PUP, LET'S GO!

26:33.526 --> 26:34.592
ANDY BASSICH: PUP,
PUP, PUP, PUP!

26:34.694 --> 26:35.893
HEY, HEY, COME HERE!

26:35.995 --> 26:36.961
COME, COME.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.196
PUPPY, PUPPY, PUPPY!

26:38.298 --> 26:40.131
COME HERE,
COME HERE, COME ON.

26:40.233 --> 26:41.966
PUPPY, PUPPY, PUPPY!

26:42.068 --> 26:45.470
LET'S GO, COME ON, PUP, PUP,
PUP, PUP, PUP, LET'S GO.

26:45.705 --> 26:50.174
COME ON, EASY, (BLEEP).

26:51.678 --> 26:54.045
UNFORTUNATELY,
PUPPIES ARE FEARLESS.

26:54.147 --> 26:55.813
PUPPIES HAVE NO
LIFE EXPERIENCE,

26:55.915 --> 26:57.782
SO THEY ARE AFRAID
OF ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.718
YEAH, I GOT BIG,
SMART, BIG OLD DOGS HERE,

27:01.120 --> 27:03.120
AND A BUNCH OF DUMB
LITTLE PUPPIES WHO HAVE NO FEAR

27:03.223 --> 27:05.590
WHATSOEVER OF
WATER, ICE, OR ANYTHING.

27:05.859 --> 27:07.325
THOSE PUPPIES JUST
WALKED RIGHT UP TO THE

27:07.427 --> 27:08.693
EDGE OF THAT OPEN LEAD.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.162
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING
THESE DOGS UNTIL THEY LEARN

27:11.264 --> 27:13.130
AND THE ONLY WAY
THEY LEARN IS TO GET WET.

27:13.233 --> 27:15.299
WELL, THEY GET WET IN
THAT ONE AND THEY'RE DEAD.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.268
THAT'S IT, IT'S OVER.

27:17.370 --> 27:19.570
MY INSTINCTS TOLD ME GO
OVER AND GRAB THE PUPPIES

27:19.672 --> 27:21.439
AND THROW 'EM
AWAY FROM THE HOLE.

27:21.541 --> 27:23.741
MY EXPERIENCE TOLD ME
THAT WAS PROBABLY GONNA FORCE

27:23.843 --> 27:26.377
THEM INTO THE HOLE, SO IT
WAS JUST PUPPY, PUPPY, PUPPY,

27:26.479 --> 27:29.013
AND RUN AWAY, AND
HOPE THAT THEY FOLLOW YOU.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.948
YOU GOT TO STAY
AWAY FROM OPEN WATER.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.017
HE SAYS YEAH,
BUT I WAS THIRSTY.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.185
I WANTED A DRINK.

27:34.287 --> 27:36.621
WELL, YOU GET
A DRINK, FOREVER.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.723
YOU GO IN THE DRINK,
GETTING A DRINK.

27:41.294 --> 27:42.660
I MADE IT ACROSS.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.996
THE ICE IS PRETTY DICEY
ON THE FAR SHORELINE

27:45.098 --> 27:47.565
FOR THE LAST 50-60 YARDS.

27:47.667 --> 27:51.002
WE GET SOME COLD TEMPERATURES,
AND THAT'LL HARDEN RIGHT UP.

27:56.309 --> 27:57.708
WHAT I'M PUTTING IN NOW,

27:57.810 --> 27:59.510
I'M GONNA BE USING
A LOT THIS WINTER.

27:59.612 --> 28:01.579
SO, I WANT THIS
TO BE A GOOD TRAIL.

28:01.681 --> 28:04.415
I GOT A LOT OF TRIPS BACK
AND FORTH ACROSS THIS RIVER,

28:04.517 --> 28:06.984
SO THE BETTER I CAN MAKE
IT FOR ME AND FOR THE DOGS,

28:07.086 --> 28:10.187
EASIER IT IS ON MY EQUIPMENT,
AND THE MORE TIMES I WANNA GO,

28:10.290 --> 28:13.157
AND THE BIGGER LOADS I
CAN HAUL BACK AND FORTH.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.193
COME ON, BOYS,
LET'S GO HOME.

28:19.265 --> 28:22.166
SUE AIKENS: ANYTHING THAT
ALLOWS ME TO THINK OUTSIDE THE

28:22.268 --> 28:24.869
BOX NURTURES MY PERSONALITY.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.846
THE PROJECT.

28:37.050 --> 28:38.783
BEEN LOOKING AT IT,
THINKING ABOUT IT,

28:38.885 --> 28:40.451
TURNING ON
IT ALL NIGHT LONG.

28:40.553 --> 28:43.120
THE PROJECT THAT I'VE COME
UP WITH IS BUILDING A SAUNA.

28:43.656 --> 28:45.723
WHAT DO I DO FOR
KEEPING CLEAN THE NINE,

28:45.825 --> 28:47.625
TEN MONTHS I HAVE
NO RUNNING WATER?

28:47.727 --> 28:50.661
I WILL JUST HEAT UP A LITTLE
PAN OF IT, GET A WASHCLOTH,

28:50.763 --> 28:53.864
SOAP IT UP, PUT THE SOAP
ON, RINSE THE WASHCLOTH OUT,

28:53.967 --> 28:55.433
WIPE THE SOAP AND DIRT OFF.

28:55.535 --> 28:57.034
I'M CLEAN
ON THE SURFACE,

28:57.136 --> 28:59.203
BUT I'D LIKE TO GET
CLEAN FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.405
BUILDING A
SAUNA MIGHT DO THAT.

29:02.875 --> 29:07.545
EVERY SINGLE PROJECT I DO,
I TRY TO REPURPOSE, REUSE,

29:10.416 --> 29:13.784
WHAT'S OUT HERE THAT
I CAN CLEAN FROM ONE AREA

29:13.987 --> 29:16.053
AND USE IN ANOTHER?

29:16.322 --> 29:18.356
TO BRING IN BRAND NEW
MATERIALS AND PUT UP A BRAND

29:18.458 --> 29:21.626
NEW THING IS
EXTREMELY COSTLY AND WASTEFUL.

29:21.728 --> 29:23.094
ARE YOU GONNA HELP MAMA?

29:23.196 --> 29:24.729
YOU GONNA HELP ME OUT?

29:24.831 --> 29:25.730
WHAT DOES IT TAKE?

29:25.832 --> 29:28.232
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME
FOR ME TO GO AND SAY,

29:28.334 --> 29:29.767
"OOH, THAT'S OLD GREENHOUSE.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.469
OOH, THERE'S
AN OLD MATTRESS."

29:31.571 --> 29:32.603
IS IT BEAUTIFUL?

29:32.705 --> 29:35.206
NO, NEITHER AM I, BUT I'M
A HELLA FUNCTIONAL PERSON.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.141
SAME THING HERE.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.677
IT AIN'T PRETTY, BUT IT'S
GONNA PROVIDE A FUNCTION.

29:44.484 --> 29:45.483
SO, HERE WE GO.

29:45.585 --> 29:47.885
TIME TO GET THIS THING GOING.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.190
I'M GONNA TRY NOT
TO USE TOO MUCH IN THE WAY

29:53.292 --> 29:55.860
OF SCREWS AND NAILS.

29:55.962 --> 29:58.362
I DON'T NEED IT TO LAST
THE 60 MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.598
I'LL TAKE IT DOWN,
PUT IT UP WHEN I NEED IT.

30:00.700 --> 30:06.904
IN A PROJECT LIKE THIS, THE
MAJORITY OF THE TIME SPENT

30:07.006 --> 30:11.842
IS MORE GATHERING THE SUPPLIES
AND THINKING OF THE PROJECT

30:11.944 --> 30:14.378
THAN PUTTING IT
TOGETHER SOMETIMES.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.480
OH, YOU SON OF A GUN.

30:16.582 --> 30:17.982
DON'T YOU MOVE.

30:18.084 --> 30:20.317
IF I WERE THINKING OF
LIVING IN IT ALL WINTER,

30:20.420 --> 30:22.787
I'D BE THINKING AGAIN
HOW I'M BUILDING IT.

30:22.889 --> 30:25.790
BUT TEMPORARY-TEMPORARY.

30:34.734 --> 30:38.069
GET DOWN THERE.

30:38.805 --> 30:39.904
ALL RIGHT.

30:40.006 --> 30:43.307
GET MY LITTLE
MATTRESS, PLOP THAT IN.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.279
THIS IS INSULATED.

30:48.381 --> 30:49.680
IT'S REFLECTIVE.

30:49.782 --> 30:51.949
GET THE HEAT SOURCE GOING
AND THE STEAM GOING IN THERE,

30:52.051 --> 30:53.984
THIS'LL REFLECT IT BACK DOWN.

30:54.087 --> 30:55.019
BUT IT'S TEMPORARY.

30:55.121 --> 30:57.321
I CAN ROLL IT
DOWN, TIE IT OFF.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.023
OOPS, IT'S GONNA
BE ICKY WEATHER,

30:59.125 --> 31:01.158
I CAN ROLL IT BACK UP.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.063
MAMA'S LOOKING, MAMA LIKEY.

31:08.201 --> 31:11.302
MY STEP AND GET IN.

31:11.537 --> 31:12.603
ALL RIGHT.

31:12.739 --> 31:16.073
NOW THAT THIS IS DONE,
I'M GONNA GET ALL MY STUFF PUT

31:16.175 --> 31:18.642
TOGETHER, SEE IF IT WORKS.

31:21.414 --> 31:23.080
GLENN VILLENEUVE: ONE DAY
IT'S CLEAR, ONE DAY IT'S SUNNY,

31:23.182 --> 31:24.648
ONE DAY IT'S SNOWING,
ONE DAY IT'S WINDY.

31:24.751 --> 31:26.550
I MEAN, THAT'S LIFE,
IT GOES AROUND AND AROUND.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.352
CIRCLES, CYCLES, NATURE.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.600
KEEPING IT SIMPLE,
I JUST GOT MY AXE.

31:42.702 --> 31:45.169
I DON'T NEED
ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.571
BUT I GOT TO
FIND THE RIGHT SPOT.

31:47.807 --> 31:50.875
<i>NARRATOR: AFTER PROTECTING</i>
<i>HIS MEAT SUPPLY FROM SCAVENGERS,</i>

31:50.977 --> 31:52.877
<i>GLENN MUST NOW TURN HIS</i>
<i>ATTENTION TOWARD ANOTHER</i>

31:52.979 --> 31:57.348
<i>KEY TASK: STOCKPILING WOOD</i>
<i>TO SURVIVE THE MONTHS AHEAD.</i>

31:59.385 --> 32:01.719
GLENN VILLENEUVE: I'M LOOKING
FOR A PLACE WHERE THERE'RE

32:01.821 --> 32:04.488
PLENTY OF DEAD TREES
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.

32:04.824 --> 32:07.191
BUT MOST OF THESE TREES
OUT HERE ARE LIVING TREES.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.392
I DON'T WANNA
CUT LIVING TREES.

32:08.494 --> 32:09.827
I WANNA CUT DEAD TREES.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.396
DEADWOOD'S LIGHTER,
IT BURNS BETTER,

32:12.498 --> 32:13.964
I GET MORE HEAT OUT OF IT.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.934
SO, I GOT TO FIND A PLACE
WHERE I HAVEN'T CUT BEFORE

32:17.036 --> 32:19.570
WHERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF
DEAD TREES LEFT IN THE FOREST.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.141
THIS IS A NICE TIME
OF YEAR TO CUT FIREWOOD.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.977
I LIKE COMING OUT
LATE IN THE WINTER.

32:28.414 --> 32:29.947
THIS IS THE SPOT.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.449
I GOT A LOT OF DEAD
TREES GROWING CLOSE TOGETHER.

32:32.552 --> 32:34.485
ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX.

32:34.587 --> 32:36.787
THERE'S HALF A DOZEN
DEAD TREES RIGHT THERE,

32:36.889 --> 32:38.455
HALF A DOZEN MORE HERE.

32:38.558 --> 32:43.227
I CAN CUT A LOT OF DEADWOOD
IN A SMALL AREA AND PILE IT UP.

32:43.329 --> 32:44.495
THEN WHEN
I NEED THE WOOD,

32:44.597 --> 32:47.631
I CAN BRING IT BACK
TO MY CAMP WITH A SLED.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.502
THAT'S A BIG
TREE RIGHT THERE.

32:51.604 --> 32:54.538
THIS TREE TURNED
THE SUNLIGHT INTO WOOD,

32:55.541 --> 32:58.175
AND NOW I'M GONNA
TURN THAT WOOD INTO HEAT.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.751
IT'S A BIG CYCLE.

33:07.854 --> 33:10.254
ROUND AND ROUND.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.225
IT'S A BIG TREE.

33:14.327 --> 33:16.861
IT TAKES A LOT OF
WORK, BUT IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.896
WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER DO,
RUN ON A TREADMILL AT THE GYM

33:18.998 --> 33:20.497
OR CHOP FIREWOOD?

33:20.600 --> 33:22.867
I'D RATHER DO THIS ANY DAY.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.705
IT'S GETTING CLOSE.

33:33.546 --> 33:35.846
THERE IT GOES.

33:35.948 --> 33:38.082
WHOO, TIMBER!

33:38.317 --> 33:40.251
YEAH, HE-HE.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.254
LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL
FIREWOOD TREE THERE.

33:43.923 --> 33:47.057
YEAH.

33:48.895 --> 33:49.960
I GOT ONE TREE DOWN.

33:50.062 --> 33:51.028
I GOT A LOT MORE TO GO.

33:51.130 --> 33:54.131
I WANNA GET A BIG
PILE OF FIREWOOD TODAY.

33:54.367 --> 33:56.033
IT TAKES A LOT OF
ENERGY TO GET THE ENERGY

33:56.135 --> 33:57.501
OUT OF THIS WOOD.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.603
BUT IT'S A LOT OF FUN,
KEEPS YOU IN GOOD SHAPE.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.039
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME TO
HAVE HARD PHYSICAL WORK TO DO.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.340
I ENJOY IT.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.743
I ENJOY THE FEELING IN MY
BODY WHEN I'M IN GOOD SHAPE.

34:06.078 --> 34:08.078
AND CUTTING WOOD WITH
AN AXE, TREES THIS SIZE,

34:08.180 --> 34:10.547
IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT.

34:10.650 --> 34:11.982
YOU GOT TO BE IN SHAPE.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.717
AND IT KEEPS YOU IN SHAPE.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.486
WHEN I STARTED
LIVING OUT HERE,

34:15.588 --> 34:17.788
I THOUGHT YOU NEEDED
MORE TECHNOLOGY.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.823
AND THEN I THOUGHT, HEY, A
LONG TIME AGO PEOPLE USED TO

34:19.926 --> 34:21.358
LIVE OUT HERE WITHOUT
THIS TECHNOLOGY,

34:21.460 --> 34:23.160
WHY CAN'T I FIGURE
OUT HOW TO DO IT NOW?

34:23.262 --> 34:25.229
AND THEN I STARTED
GIVING THINGS UP.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.997
I GAVE UP MY CHAINSAW.

34:27.099 --> 34:29.233
I DIDN'T LIKE IT SO I
CHANGED, CHANGED TO AN AXE.

34:29.468 --> 34:31.468
FIVE YEARS AGO, IF A
WOLVERINE CAME IN MY YARD,

34:31.570 --> 34:32.636
I'D JUST TRAP IT.

34:32.738 --> 34:33.671
NOW I CHANGED.

34:33.773 --> 34:36.440
I'D RATHER WATCH IT.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.343
FIRST ONE DOWN, I
GOT A LOT MORE TO GO.

34:45.885 --> 34:48.052
JESSIE HOLMES: I'M WAY HAPPIER
CAMPING OUT WITH MY DOGS THAN

34:48.154 --> 34:50.587
I AM WHENEVER I'M AT
HOME IN MY OWN BED SLEEPING.

34:51.023 --> 34:53.490
FIGURE I CAN
SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD.

35:01.233 --> 35:04.768
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL
MORNING IN PARADISE OUT HERE.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.537
I HAD A REALLY
GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

35:06.639 --> 35:09.206
JUST HAD A NICE LONG REST.

35:09.442 --> 35:12.009
THIS IS MY INJURED
DOG RIGHT HERE, TITAN.

35:12.111 --> 35:13.777
HE'S HAD HIS WRIST
WRAPPED ALL NIGHT.

35:13.879 --> 35:17.047
THIS KIND OF THING COULD BE
A BIG DEAL WITHOUT THE RIGHT

35:17.149 --> 35:19.149
PREPARATION AND TECHNIQUE.

35:19.251 --> 35:22.353
SWELLING
DEFINITELY WENT DOWN.

35:22.455 --> 35:24.688
TODAY'S THE DAY,
IT'S THE LONG PUSH.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.558
I STARTED THE DOGS OFF WITH
A NICE 40-MILE RUN TO GET THEM

35:27.660 --> 35:30.160
WARMED UP, BUT TODAY
WE'RE GONNA BUMP IT ON UP

35:30.262 --> 35:32.296
TO UPWARDS OF 70 MILES.

35:32.398 --> 35:33.797
ALL RIGHT, READY?

35:33.899 --> 35:35.366
ALL RIGHT,
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

35:35.468 --> 35:36.567
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

35:36.669 --> 35:38.102
I GOT TO MAKE THE
BEST OF THE DAYLIGHT.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.004
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF IT,
ONLY GONNA HAVE ABOUT SEVEN

35:40.106 --> 35:42.039
HOURS OF DAYLIGHT
TODAY SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE

35:42.141 --> 35:43.273
TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT.

35:43.376 --> 35:45.442
HUP, STRAIGHT.

35:50.049 --> 35:51.415
EVERYBODY'S
LOOKING REALLY GOOD.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.984
ESPECIALLY TITAN,
HE'S LOOKING AMAZING.

35:54.487 --> 35:55.986
STRAIGHT AHEAD,
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

35:56.088 --> 35:58.022
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.658
THIS IS PEACEFUL BEING
OUT HERE WITH THE DOGS.

36:01.761 --> 36:03.060
IT'S QUIET.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.430
YOU CAN JUST HEAR THE SOUNDS
OF NATURE, THE WIND BLOWING.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.465
IT'S JUST A
REWARDING FEELING.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.934
I MEAN, I'M OUT HERE WITH
MY BEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD,

36:11.037 --> 36:13.437
WORKING HARD,
ENJOYING NATURE.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.205
I'M ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.074
I'M NOT JUST OUT
HERE SIGHTSEEING.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.675
I'M OUT HERE FOR A REASON.

36:18.778 --> 36:22.413
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS WHAT
I WAS MEANT TO BE DOING.

36:22.515 --> 36:27.151
STRAIGHT AHEAD,
HUP, STRAIGHT AHEAD.

36:28.721 --> 36:31.789
ALL RIGHT, STRAIGHT.

36:31.891 --> 36:33.757
HO.

36:36.429 --> 36:39.596
ALL RIGHT, THERE HE IS.

36:40.766 --> 36:41.999
HEY, LLOYD.

36:42.101 --> 36:43.834
LLOYD: HELLO, JESSIE.

36:43.936 --> 36:45.202
JESSIE HOLMES:
GOOD RUN OVER.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.270
LLOYD: IT WAS, HUH?

36:46.372 --> 36:47.304
JESSIE HOLMES: YEAH.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.505
CAMPED OUT LAST NIGHT.

36:48.641 --> 36:50.674
LLOYD: IT BLEW IN, BLEW IN
PRETTY GOOD LAST NIGHT, HUH?

36:50.776 --> 36:52.876
JESSIE HOLMES: MAN, HE
OPENED THE DOOR HIMSELF.

36:52.978 --> 36:56.947
THAT A BOY, COME ON,
GOOD BOY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.348
LLOYD: HE CRIED
A LOT FOR YOU.

36:58.451 --> 36:59.750
JESSIE HOLMES: OH, YEAH?

36:59.852 --> 37:02.486
LLOYD: HIS TEAM, YEAH,
THIS ONE, HE WAS LONESOME.

37:02.855 --> 37:03.787
JESSIE HOLMES:
YEAH, YOU MISS ME?

37:03.889 --> 37:06.723
AW, I MISSED YOU.

37:07.126 --> 37:08.092
I GUESS I'LL HIT THE TRAIL.

37:08.194 --> 37:09.993
GONNA TRY TO MAKE IT
BACK HOME BEFORE DARK.

37:10.096 --> 37:10.994
LLOYD: OKAY.

37:11.130 --> 37:12.496
JESSIE HOLMES: I THINK
IT'LL BE A GOOD RUN.

37:12.598 --> 37:13.864
LLOYD: TAKE CARE.

37:13.966 --> 37:15.199
JESSIE HOLMES: HEY,
THANKS A LOT, LLOYD.

37:15.301 --> 37:16.300
I SURE APPRECIATE IT.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.568
LLOYD: OKAY.

37:17.703 --> 37:19.470
JESSIE HOLMES: TIME TO HOOK
COMANCHE IN AND HEAD ON HOME.

37:19.572 --> 37:22.773
ALL RIGHT,
STRAIGHT AHEAD, GOOD BOYS.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.943
HAW, HAW, HAW.

37:26.579 --> 37:28.579
THERE YOU GO.

37:35.488 --> 37:36.720
HIKE.

37:36.822 --> 37:38.455
EY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:38.557 --> 37:39.690
HIKE.

37:39.792 --> 37:41.325
WHAT THE (BLEEP)?

37:43.195 --> 37:44.661
JESSIE HOLMES: HIKE.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.330
EY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:46.932 --> 37:48.198
HIKE.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.234
WHAT THE (BLEEP)?

37:53.606 --> 37:55.772
HEY, BUDDY, YEAH.

37:56.141 --> 37:59.810
ONE DOG THAT LOOKS
PRETTY EXHAUSTED UP THERE.

38:00.012 --> 38:02.646
TITAN'S HOLDING
HIS WRIST UP AGAIN,

38:02.748 --> 38:07.484
SO I'M GONNA PUT EM BOTH
IN THE SLED AND CARRY THEM.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.820
I GOT THE ROOM AND
I GOT THE LIGHT LOAD.

38:10.589 --> 38:12.189
I DON'T WANNA HURT MY DOG.

38:12.291 --> 38:15.259
HE MADE IT ABOUT 20 MILES
BEFORE IT WENT SORE AGAIN,

38:15.728 --> 38:18.662
SO IF THIS WOULD BE A
GOOD, FAST, EASY TRAIL,

38:18.764 --> 38:20.831
THEN HE COULD HAVE
BOUNCED RIGHT BACK OUT OF IT,

38:20.933 --> 38:23.233
BUT IT WAS
TOUGH GOING AS IT IS.

38:23.335 --> 38:25.002
HE'S NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO RUN.

38:25.104 --> 38:26.370
I GOT THE
ROOM IN THE SLED.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.472
I'M NOT GONNA
WATCH HIM STRUGGLE.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.874
NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT'S WRONG WITH KUSCO.

38:31.310 --> 38:32.943
THINK IT'S HIS WRIST.

38:33.045 --> 38:35.445
SOMETIMES THESE YOUNG
DOGS JUST GET STIFF, YOU KNOW,

38:35.548 --> 38:38.248
GETTING USED TO
THIS KIND OF RUNNING.

38:38.350 --> 38:41.485
THIS GUY'S ONLY
BARELY TWO YEARS OLD.

38:41.754 --> 38:44.721
HE'S ONE OF THE YOUNG
DOGS I WAS TESTING OUT.

38:46.225 --> 38:49.359
THIS KIND OF
TRAIL'S TOUGH ON WRIST.

38:50.262 --> 38:51.862
JUST GONNA PUT
THESE GUYS IN THE SLED.

38:51.964 --> 38:53.497
I THINK WE
GOT PLENTY OF POWER,

38:53.599 --> 38:55.933
SO I'M JUST GONNA
CARRY HIM BACK TO NENANA.

38:56.035 --> 38:58.268
I GOT 14
DOGS TO PULL THEM.

38:58.370 --> 39:02.272
PROBABLY WON'T MAKE IT
BEFORE DARK, BUT THAT'S NORMAL.

39:02.374 --> 39:03.941
IF YOU DON'T DO THINGS
IN THE DARK UP HERE,

39:04.043 --> 39:07.578
YOU JUST DON'T DO THINGS CAUSE
IT'S DARK MOST OF THE TIME.

39:07.680 --> 39:08.745
HIKE UP.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.581
ALL RIGHT, GO HOME.

39:20.593 --> 39:24.027
<i>[BARKING]</i>

39:25.130 --> 39:27.097
HAW, STRAIGHT UP,
STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT AHEAD.

39:27.199 --> 39:28.298
THERE YOU GO.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.667
STRAIGHT UP,
WHOA, GOOD BOYS.

39:32.004 --> 39:33.704
TIGHTEN UP, STAY, GOOD.

39:33.806 --> 39:35.772
STAY.

39:36.141 --> 39:38.108
I'M ECSTATIC WITH THE
PERFORMANCE OF EVERYBODY

39:38.210 --> 39:39.242
IN THE TEAM.

39:39.345 --> 39:42.579
I HAD EIGHT DOGS THAT
WEREN'T VETERANS OF THE TEAM

39:43.015 --> 39:45.515
IN HERE THAT
JUST DID 70-MILE RUN.

39:45.618 --> 39:47.017
IT'S GOOD TO
HAVE COMANCHE BACK.

39:47.119 --> 39:50.320
HE RAN UP THERE
BASICALLY IN LEAD THE WHOLE WAY,

39:50.589 --> 39:52.623
SO THAT RIGHT THERE WILL
TELL YOU WHAT A VALUABLE

39:52.725 --> 39:54.257
DOG HE IS TO ME.

39:54.360 --> 39:57.761
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY AND
PERKY FOR AFTER A 70 MILE RUN

39:57.863 --> 40:02.032
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANNA SEE
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.267
I GOT A LOT OF FAITH
IN THE REST OF THE RACE

40:04.370 --> 40:06.903
SEASON COMING UP HERE.

40:11.143 --> 40:12.175
GLENN VILLENEUVE: IF
THERE WAS NOTHING CHANGING,

40:12.277 --> 40:14.211
IT WOULD BE LIKE YOU
WERE FROZEN IN TIME.

40:14.313 --> 40:16.013
THAT'S WHY I'M
ALWAYS CHANGING, ADAPTING,

40:16.115 --> 40:17.280
FINDING NEW THINGS.

40:17.383 --> 40:20.017
KEEP LIFE INTERESTING.

40:25.057 --> 40:26.957
I GOT SOME
WOOD CUT UP TODAY.

40:27.059 --> 40:28.358
THE JOB'S ONLY HALF DONE.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.694
I GOT IT CUT DOWN,
NOW I GOT TO STACK IT UP.

40:30.963 --> 40:33.397
NARRATOR: AFTER HOURS OF
GRUELING WORK WITH HIS AXE,

40:33.499 --> 40:35.165
GLENN HAS GATHERED
ENOUGH FIREWOOD TO LAST

40:35.267 --> 40:36.967
HIM THROUGH
THE COMING MONTHS.

40:37.069 --> 40:38.869
WITHOUT IT, HE'D BE
UNABLE TO ENDURE THE

40:38.971 --> 40:40.871
REMAINDER OF DARK WINTER.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.041
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
YEAH, THERE WE GO.

40:44.143 --> 40:45.609
THESE ARE BIG
CHUNKS OF WOOD HERE.

40:45.711 --> 40:48.412
SOME WEIGHT TO MOVE AROUND.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.581
THIS IS WHAT'S
GONNA HEAT MY CABIN.

40:51.684 --> 40:53.216
THIS IS WHAT'S
GONNA COOK MY FOOD.

40:53.318 --> 40:55.986
THIS IS HOW I'M GONNA HEAT
MY HOT WATER WHEN I WANNA BATHE.

40:56.088 --> 40:58.488
YEAH, THERE.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.727
WOOD IS MEASURED IN CORDS.

41:03.962 --> 41:07.764
A CORD OF WOOD
IS 128 CUBIC FEET.

41:08.534 --> 41:11.702
I BURN ABOUT FOUR CUBIC
FEET OF THIS STUFF EVERY DAY

41:11.904 --> 41:13.136
IN REAL COLD WEATHER.

41:13.238 --> 41:14.971
NOW WINTER'S STARTING
TO LOSE ITS GRIP,

41:15.074 --> 41:18.608
WOOD WILL LAST
ME A LITTLE LONGER.

41:18.711 --> 41:21.378
TO STACK UP A BIG PILE OF
WOOD WITH NOTHING BUT AN AXE,

41:21.480 --> 41:23.747
IT'S VERY SATISFYING.

41:24.817 --> 41:26.917
OH, MY LAST LOG.

41:27.019 --> 41:28.552
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

41:28.654 --> 41:30.587
I'M ABOUT READY
TO HEAD HOME.

41:30.689 --> 41:33.056
WHAT A
BEAUTIFUL PILE OF WOOD.

41:33.325 --> 41:36.159
I GOT MORE THAN A CORD HERE,
PROBABLY A CORD-AND-A-HALF.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.762
THIS'LL LAST ME THE
REST OF THE WINTER.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.597
<i>[GRUNTS]</i>

41:42.367 --> 41:44.601
YOU GOT TO EXPEND
ENERGY TO GET ENERGY.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.369
I PUT A LOT OF ENERGY
INTO CUTTING THIS WOOD,

41:46.472 --> 41:48.872
BUT I'M GONNA GET A LOT
OF ENERGY OUT OF IT.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.373
WHEW, IT'S
BEEN A LONG DAY.

41:50.476 --> 41:51.942
I'M GONNA
CALL IT A NIGHT.

41:52.044 --> 41:54.878
I'LL COME BACK IN MY SLED
AND HAUL IT HOME AS I NEED IT.

41:58.417 --> 42:00.016
ANDY BASSICH: I VALUE
HAVING PEOPLE IN MY LIFE,

42:00.119 --> 42:02.319
BUT I ALSO
VALUE MY TIME ALONE,

42:02.421 --> 42:04.888
AND I REALLY VALUE
MY TIME IN THE WILDERNESS.

42:14.733 --> 42:17.100
COME ON, BUDDY.

42:18.103 --> 42:19.469
COME ON, BOYS.

42:19.571 --> 42:20.704
COME ON, PUPPERS.

42:20.806 --> 42:23.106
YOU WANNA COME SEE
HOW THIS IS DONE?

42:23.208 --> 42:25.475
I'M HOOKING UP THE DOGS
TO TRY AND BURN SOME FAT OFF.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.378
THESE GUYS ARE BIG AND FAT
CUZ WE HAVEN'T HAD MUCH SNOW,

42:28.781 --> 42:30.113
AND I HAVEN'T HAD
MANY PLACES THAT I'VE BEEN

42:30.215 --> 42:31.648
ABLE TO RUN THE DOGS.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.084
I PUT A TRAIL IN ACROSS
THE RIVER YESTERDAY WITH A SNOW

42:34.186 --> 42:36.319
MACHINE AND JUST
KIND OF WALKED IT OUT.

42:36.421 --> 42:37.621
DOGS CAME WITH ME.

42:37.723 --> 42:39.422
WE FOUND A
FAIRLY SAFE TRAIL,

42:39.525 --> 42:41.892
SO I'M JUST GONNA
TRY AND GET THE DOGS OUT.

42:41.994 --> 42:44.060
THEY WANNA GET OUT AND RUN
AND GET THEIR BLOOD WARMED UP.

42:44.163 --> 42:46.363
I WANNA GET MY BLOOD WARMED
UP AND WE ALL WANNA PUT SOME

42:46.465 --> 42:48.698
MILES ON THE SLED,

42:48.801 --> 42:51.468
AND SO THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO TODAY.

42:51.570 --> 42:53.970
OKAY, YOU GUYS READY?

42:54.606 --> 42:56.239
OKAY, LET'S GO, HUP-HUP.

42:56.341 --> 42:59.142
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, YEE-HAW.

43:00.679 --> 43:02.779
STRAIGHT AHEAD, EASY.

43:06.351 --> 43:08.351
IT'S KIND OF A
TWO-EDGED SWORD.

43:08.453 --> 43:12.055
YUKON RIVER IS
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

43:12.157 --> 43:14.257
IT CAN BE VERY DAUNTING
AND VERY CHALLENGING,

43:14.626 --> 43:17.494
BUT IT'S ALSO YOUR LIFELINE.

43:17.763 --> 43:20.530
SO, YOU GOT TO KIND OF FIND
A BALANCE OUT THERE, EVERY YEAR.

43:20.632 --> 43:22.332
AND EVERY YEAR IS
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

43:23.802 --> 43:25.569
WHOO-HOO, THAT A BOYS.

43:26.505 --> 43:28.839
YEAH, OKAY
LET'S GO, LITTLE HAW.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.075
THAT A BOYS,
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

43:32.411 --> 43:35.212
THAT A BOYS,
LITTLE MORE HAW.

43:35.314 --> 43:37.180
STRAIGHT AHEAD, WHOO!

43:37.449 --> 43:40.250
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

43:41.220 --> 43:42.919
GOOD BOYS,
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

43:43.021 --> 43:45.622
PUTTING THE WORK IN AND TAKING
THE RISK TO CROSS YUKON RIVER

43:45.724 --> 43:49.226
IS NOW I HAVE ACCESS TO
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MILES OF

43:49.328 --> 43:52.662
TRAIL AND HUNDREDS OF MILES
OF COUNTRY THAT I CAN COLLECT

43:52.764 --> 43:55.632
WOOD IN, I CAN RUN MY DOGS,
I CAN GO TRAPPING IN.

43:55.734 --> 43:57.834
SO IT BASICALLY
OPENED UP MY WORLD.

43:57.936 --> 44:00.303
OH, MY DOGS DID GREAT.

44:00.739 --> 44:02.505
THEY'RE HAVING
A BALL OUT HERE.

44:02.608 --> 44:04.541
FINALLY, WE'RE
ABLE TO GET OUT AND RUN.

44:04.643 --> 44:06.776
THESE GUYS, THAT'S
WHAT THEY'RE MEANT TO DO.

44:06.879 --> 44:08.078
THEY LOVE TO RUN.

44:08.213 --> 44:10.714
YOU CAN SEE IT IN THEIR FACES,
YOU CAN SEE IT IN THEIR TAILS.

44:10.816 --> 44:13.383
TAILS ARE UP, THEY'RE
WAGGING, THEY'RE HAPPY,

44:13.485 --> 44:16.419
AND THEY'RE EXCITED
TO GO SOMEPLACE NEW.

44:17.389 --> 44:19.422
COME ON, BOYS.

44:33.839 --> 44:35.872
SUE AIKENS: THE COLD
TO ME IS LIKE A LIVING,

44:35.974 --> 44:38.475
BREATHING
ANTAGONIST, AN ANIMAL.

44:39.144 --> 44:42.279
AND YOU NEED TO
OUTSMART IT, OUTTHINK IT.

44:46.184 --> 44:48.451
I'M GONNA GET
EVERYTHING IN HERE,

44:48.553 --> 44:50.287
AND LET HER
BURN, LET HER RIP.

44:51.690 --> 44:53.189
HAD THE IDEA
FOR THE SAUNA.

44:53.292 --> 44:55.859
STARTED THIS BY
CLEANING OUT ALL THE ASH.

44:55.961 --> 44:59.162
WE'LL USE HOT ROCKS,
PUT WATER ON 'EM,

44:59.264 --> 45:03.300
WHEN YOU GET THIS
STEAM AND IT'S INSTANT SWEAT,

45:03.402 --> 45:05.669
INSTANT PORE CLEANING.

45:14.713 --> 45:15.879
THERE YOU GO.

45:15.981 --> 45:18.581
IT'S LIT, SO YEE-HAW.

45:19.318 --> 45:22.118
THE GARBAGE IS BEING
REDUCED TO ITS LOWEST ASH.

45:22.220 --> 45:26.523
I'M BURNING IT EXTRA HOT,
SO THAT THOSE ROCKS ARE GONNA

45:26.625 --> 45:30.260
JUST REALLY
STOKE AND HEAT UP.

45:40.372 --> 45:43.707
<i>[GUSTING WIND]</i>

45:43.809 --> 45:45.375
ALL RIGHTY.

45:45.477 --> 45:48.011
WHEW, IS IT COLD.

45:48.613 --> 45:50.347
I GOT THE ROCKS IN THERE.

45:50.449 --> 45:52.082
THEY WERE STEAMING AWAY.

45:52.184 --> 45:54.651
I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE
WATER TO ADD IF I NEED IT.

45:55.387 --> 45:56.486
ON THIS COLD OF A NIGHT,

45:56.588 --> 45:59.022
THE ICE CRYSTALS
THEMSELVES BECOME STEAM.

45:59.925 --> 46:02.258
SO, LET ME
GET MYSELF IN.

46:06.331 --> 46:08.832
HOLD ON TO THIS.

46:08.934 --> 46:11.034
WHOA LOOK AT, LOOK
AT THAT STEAM, MAN.

46:11.737 --> 46:14.204
THIS IS A CULMINATION OF
SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO GET DIRTY

46:14.306 --> 46:15.338
TO GET CLEAN.

46:15.474 --> 46:18.241
I WORKED REALLY HARD
GETTING SOME OF MY JOBS DONE,

46:18.343 --> 46:22.312
BUT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW,
IT'S TIME TO REAP THE REWARD

46:22.948 --> 46:25.949
SO GONNA GET MY
LITTLE BOOTY IN HERE.

46:31.723 --> 46:33.156
WHOO!

46:36.795 --> 46:38.161
MY HAIR IS GETTING DAMP.

46:38.263 --> 46:40.764
I GOT SWEAT STARTING TO FORM.

46:40.866 --> 46:44.067
THIS IS DOING EXACTLY,
EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED IT TO DO.

46:46.038 --> 46:49.506
IT STARTED BY HAVING A
VISION, WANTING TO BE CREATIVE.

46:49.608 --> 46:52.275
KNOCK ON WOOD,
I GOT IT DONE.
