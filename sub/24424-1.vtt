05:44.553 --> 05:46.054
I don't even know what to say.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.223

your mother.

they'd never leave.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.214
You may want to consider
going with 'em.

06:27.387 --> 06:32.434

06:33.685 --> 06:34.978

a little break while I was gone,

06:42.402 --> 06:43.987

I'm meeting someone
and you're in their seat.

07:03.298 --> 07:06.259
My bad. I didn't think there was
assigned seating around here.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.385
I can post up at the bar.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.887

You brothers date outside
your race all the time

07:17.228 --> 07:20.065

it's a problem.

church in this city.

you're going to have to split time between here and DC,

09:46.002 --> 09:48.213
What he said.
I gotta go to work too. Here you go.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.757
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.009
Thank you, have a good day.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.470
Um, I got some change coming.
That wasn't a tip, brother.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.138
Oh. Okay.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.725
Hey. Look-a here, look-a here.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.102
- Excuse me.
- What's the hurry, mama?

10:02.185 --> 10:03.019
First of all, get your hands
off me

10:03.103 --> 10:04.771
You ain't nothing but a ratchet,
horse-haired ho.

10:04.854 --> 10:05.772
No. You just mad--

10:05.855 --> 10:07.565
Hey, hey, hey.
Is there a problem?

10:08.817 --> 10:09.818
Nah.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.694
I ain't got no problem.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.159
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.329
Thank you.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.706
I'mma owe you
twice now. Thanks.

10:24.082 --> 10:24.999
Don't sweat it.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.252
You know, I live right down
the block.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.505
I can just go get your money, pay you back,
'cause I really don't like to owe people.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.631
I gotta go.

10:31.714 --> 10:36.511
Oh, but, you know what?
A friend of mine is having a poetry jam over here tomorrow.

10:36.678 --> 10:41.558
So, if you're free, you can come on down,
have a drink with me, and we'll call it even.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.060
I love poetry.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.061
Yeah.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.481
Well, in that case, instead of you meeting me there,
maybe I can come pick you up?

10:49.691 --> 10:50.942
Are you serious?

10:51.025 --> 10:52.527
Yeah, I'm serious.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.863
As long as you don't mind
if my girl comes with us.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.949
Little group thing.
You, me--

10:58.032 --> 10:59.450
- Okay, I don't know--
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.536
- I promise, I'm kidding
- That's a little too much. [Laughs]

11:01.619 --> 11:02.954
I'm Dante.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.999
Tanisha.
Nice to meet you, Dante.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.170
You gonna take me
to dinner, too?

11:11.379 --> 11:12.297
Why not?

11:12.672 --> 11:15.216
I like Red Lobster,
just in case.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.426
- Red Lobster?
- Mm-hmm.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.969
- I do, too.
- Ooh.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.889
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.473
Um, my number's on there.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.559
I see it. [Laughs]

11:24.642 --> 11:25.768
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.354
[Knocking]

11:28.438 --> 11:29.480
Hey.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.649
So I was right about him wanting
you to run for office.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.484
[Both chuckle]

11:33.568 --> 11:35.278
You're always right about
those sort of things, James.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.279
Yes, sir.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.323
That's why I rely
on you so much.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.699
[Sighing]

11:41.326 --> 11:43.870
That is also why I worry
about you so much.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.663
Why do you worry about me?

11:46.414 --> 11:48.041
Are you seeing sister
Audrey Johnson?

11:48.124 --> 11:50.001
She might've been by
the house a few times.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.210
Why, what'd she say?

11:51.294 --> 11:52.462
Well, it's not her.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.130
It's what the women
in the church are saying.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.007
Ah, well, there you have it.

11:56.966 --> 12:01.054
See, I think most of those sisters might've
been by the house themselves a few times.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.680
James, listen to me.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.768
You cannot use the church
as your own personal eHarmony.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.436
- Oh, my goodness.
- You understand?

12:08.728 --> 12:12.315
Church is not a dating site.
And you're a deacon for Christ's sake.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.108
T.K., you're the preacher,
not me.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.945
I only profess to being a man
looking for redemption.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.405
All I'm asking you to do
is do better.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.574
And you're one of the best
Deacons in this church.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.494
And you're the only one I can seem to get the truth out of around here.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.663
So, stop worrying
about my social life.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.331
Because I am not going to
stop being a man.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.209
Hey. Reverend Reynolds.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.418
What can I do for you?

12:32.502 --> 12:33.711
Bishop. Deacon.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.589
Just wanted to remind you that this
weekend I'll be going home for three days.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.091
Oh, that's wonderful.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.092
Going to see your family?

12:39.425 --> 12:40.301
Yes, sir.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.928
Well, have fun. Be safe.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.346
- Thank you.
- Check in with me.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.347
Will do.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.850
Hey, that young man's
gon' go far around here.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.812
That boy right there's gonna be
our next pastor when you retire.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.897
Hoo, well, you better talk to
my wife about that.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.607
Oh. Mark my words.
Who else?

12:54.691 --> 12:56.067
She's grooming Dante for that.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.235
No.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.152
[Laughing] Yeah.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.782
♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪

13:07.036 --> 13:09.038
♪ South paw
Caught me off-guard ♪

13:09.122 --> 13:10.665
♪ Wasn't ready
For the left hand ♪

13:10.748 --> 13:12.709
Probably take her out for a little romantic dinner or something like that.

13:12.792 --> 13:18.172
Listen, man,
I cannot believe you about to go all out for this thot.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.758
So you sure you wanna put
the 26 inches up at the top?

13:20.842 --> 13:23.594
I want you just put a piece right here,
make it fuller, like, [makes swooshing sound]

13:23.678 --> 13:25.096
You know, so it can be... Yeah.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.305
- Okay.
- Up in the front.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.600
So, we bringin' out the real expensive,
fancy hair for this guy.

13:29.684 --> 13:30.935
You must really like him.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.147
Uh, no, I mean, he a'ight.
He a'ight.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.315
- Oh, yeah, that's right. He all right.
- Yeah.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.483
I don't know
who you frontin' for.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.570
I done been your friend too long
for you to know "he a'ight."

13:40.653 --> 13:41.779
I know you like him.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.532
You 'bout to ruin it
for every brother, man.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.493
I'm pretty sure she doesn't require much but a bag of policies

13:47.577 --> 13:49.787
and a little shot glass
of Ciroc.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.664
See, that, this moment right here,
remember this.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.375
This is exactly why
Donna won't date you.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.462
I just need him to know that
you are special, okay?

13:57.545 --> 14:00.965
Well, if he don't,
it don't even matter 'cause I'm movin' away soon anyways.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.384
What you mean you movin'
away real soon?

14:03.468 --> 14:05.053
I told you I'm going to school.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.013
I got accepted
into Norfolk State.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.765
Yes, yes. I forgot, I forgot.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.142
Your sister is different.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.393
She's special.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.978
- So is Tanisha.
- Man.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.980
You judgin' her 'cause
she stay in the PJs.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.440
So what she live
in the projects?

14:17.982 --> 14:19.567
You gonna like her when you meet her,
I bet you.

14:20.777 --> 14:25.365
I mean, this dude is in a whole 'nother league, like,
he is so different.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.409
And that's why you should
go to school, get your education

14:28.493 --> 14:29.952
and I'mma hold him down.
I'mma be like--

14:30.036 --> 14:30.995
- See?
- I got him...

14:31.079 --> 14:31.954
Wait a minute.

14:32.038 --> 14:32.955
...for you, while you gone.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.874
See, I didn't even see that
coming, but you know what--

14:34.957 --> 14:35.958
- I'm just saying.
- You crazy.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.335
We gon' get you your own man.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.253
- Well, I hope so. It's on.
- Hands off this one.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.338
- All right.
- Don't be moving.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.464
You hurtin' me though.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.382
I won't do it tight.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.424
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.093
- Where the needle at?
- [Sigh]

14:47.845 --> 14:49.305
[Charlene] Honey,
have you heard from your sister?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.057
She, uh, is not answering
her phone.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.975
She's supposed to be running
bingo tonight.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.185
Mmm, no, ma'am.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.479
She wanted to borrow my car,
but I got a date tonight.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.647
[Laughing mockingly]

14:57.730 --> 15:01.442
Well, if, uh, you don't hear from her, you know,
you might have to cut that date short.

15:01.859 --> 15:05.988
Mom, no. I can't. I have a date.
First one in a long time.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.449
[Laughs] Sorry, didn't mean
to laugh at that.

15:08.533 --> 15:12.161
Uh, but, honey, um, you are
activities director

15:12.245 --> 15:15.415
and the reason why you have that
position is because if we get into trouble,

15:15.498 --> 15:17.667
uh, your father
and I can depend on you.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.752
Can't you find somebody else?

15:24.173 --> 15:25.299
[Knocking on door]

15:27.593 --> 15:30.179
Nisha. Your company here.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.890
She almost ready. Come on in.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.392
Okay, thank you.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.938
You, um, Dante, right?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.231
Yes, ma'am.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.524
So, you got a cigarette?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.568
Uh, sorry, I don't smoke.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.986
Oh, well, you got, um...

15:45.486 --> 15:47.238
You think you could
give me eight dollars

15:47.321 --> 15:49.365
so I can get me
some, uh, Newports?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.075
Um, I'm sorry, Miss...

15:51.826 --> 15:53.870
I'm Elena. Tanisha's mama.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.705
Miss Elena, I don't have
any cash on me.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.665
I was gonna hit the ATM
after I left here.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.376
That's all right. You know,
just bring me something when y'all come back,

16:00.460 --> 16:01.461
all right? I mean...

16:01.544 --> 16:02.628
What, y'all going to
the restaurant, right?

16:02.712 --> 16:05.423
Um, well, we were
supposed to, but, uh--

16:05.506 --> 16:06.507
But what?

16:10.052 --> 16:12.263
Wow. You look good.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.348
You look damn good.

16:14.891 --> 16:15.975
Thank you.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.185
- But finish talking.
- [Phone ringing]

16:17.268 --> 16:18.853
You were saying
we're supposed to, but--

16:18.936 --> 16:21.314
One second,
I have to take this.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.065
Anita, I'm on the way.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.902
Probably 10 minutes.

16:28.029 --> 16:31.157
This Anita,
I hope she's the hostess at the restaurant we're going to eat at.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.074
Yeah.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.285
Yeah, about that, um...

16:34.869 --> 16:36.329
I'm sorry, but I have to cancel.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.872
- What?
- Something came up.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.958
Oh, hell nah.
You not gonna come up in here and play me.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.460
I've been spending all day
gettin' my hair done.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.461
That's what you not
gonna do.

16:43.544 --> 16:44.545
I'm not tryin' to play you.

16:44.629 --> 16:47.173
Look, if you don't believe me,
you can come down to the church with me.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.591
Oh. Church? Wow.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.301
Oh, my God.
Mama, you hear this bull?

16:50.384 --> 16:52.762
So, what? You tellin' me you a preacher now?
Is that what you tellin' me?

16:53.638 --> 16:55.097
I'm the preacher's son,
actually.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.098
Oh, shit.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.185
And the reason I have to cancel is because I have to run bingo tonight.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.353
Bingo.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.439
Boy, you can't come up with something better than that?
Bingo?

17:03.523 --> 17:07.818
Tanisha, get this damn fool out of here before he
make a bigger fool of you than he already has.

17:07.902 --> 17:08.736
- Boy, please.
- You heard her.

17:08.819 --> 17:09.654
Get out my house.

17:09.737 --> 17:13.281
Look, if you think I'm lyin' come down
to First Jamaican Ministries and see.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.785
Let me go ahead and
give you this. All right?

17:15.867 --> 17:17.537
Now I don't owe you nothin'.

17:17.619 --> 17:18.746
Mm-hmm, that's right, baby.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.289
Go have fun with Anita.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.209
Go on, get out of here, boy.
Get the fuck out of here.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.424
Hey, everybody. I'm really,
really sorry, I know I'm late.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.718
Listen, my sister was
supposed to do this and...

17:32.802 --> 17:34.971
But I'm here. Shall we?
Let's play some bingo. All right.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.556
[Phone ringing]

17:36.639 --> 17:38.266
Hey girl, what's up?
I'm just gettin' to work.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.934
I thought you were supposed
to be on your date.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.061
Yeah, tell Mel
I'm comin' in after all.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.188
Wait, wait, wait.
So, what happened?

17:45.064 --> 17:48.317
After all this money I spent getting ready for this date,
this negro cancels.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.028
He's talkin' about
he's workin' at a church

17:51.112 --> 17:53.281
and, I don't know,
he has some bingo game tonight.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.407
Bingo?

17:54.490 --> 17:55.825
N-39.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.536
That was a false alarm,
Sister Moore did not have bingo.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.748
I don't know, girl. We know some lyin' asses,
and I never of bingo before.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.792
Maybe he's tellin' you
the truth.

18:05.376 --> 18:06.502
[Sighs]

18:06.919 --> 18:08.754
Tash, I'll see you later
all right, girl?

18:09.505 --> 18:11.507
[Indistinct chatter]

18:12.258 --> 18:14.343
Oh. Yes. Ah.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.186
Uh, can I help you?

18:24.270 --> 18:27.023
Oh. Yes, hi. Um...

18:27.106 --> 18:29.650
Is there someone by the
of Dante who works here?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.153
And you are?

18:32.528 --> 18:35.156
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm his friend, Tanisha.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.575
Are you his mother?

18:38.492 --> 18:40.786
I can see where he
gets the good looks.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.080
No. I'm not his mother.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.916
She didn't mean nothin'
by it, sweetheart.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.502
Dante is right over there.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.046
All right. Y'all ready?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.797
Almost done with it.
Two more cards to go.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.215
Thank you. Can I sit?

18:53.299 --> 18:55.051
- Yeah, right there.
- Okay, thank you.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.385
[Dante]
We gon' get some winners.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.263
Next number, B-7.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.140
There we go.
Somebody, that sound like a good number.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.391
B-7?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.894
Anybody? B-7.

19:09.815 --> 19:10.858
B-7.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.988
So I see, you really do
work in church.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.281
Imagine that.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.659
You must hate me
for how I acted.

19:19.742 --> 19:22.161
Nah. I probably wouldn't have
believed me either.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.996
I'm sorry. Okay?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.539
Apology accepted.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.333
So, we're cool?

19:27.416 --> 19:28.959
We are very cool.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.086
[Cough] Balloon?

19:31.045 --> 19:32.922
This is the house of the Lord.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.507
Show some respect.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.842
- How y'all doin'?
- Oh, hey, Deacon.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.678
Hey now, leave these
young folks alone.

19:38.761 --> 19:39.929
They ain't doin' nothin' wrong.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.015
We gon' get home and watch the 700 Guard we gon' see who's on that.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.851
But, uh, we can't
leave them.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.478
Yeah, well, he got the key.

19:47.937 --> 19:52.108
But, uh, we could, you know,
stay until everything's locked up.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.110
Oh, no, no. I got it.
I can handle it.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.528
I'll lock it up, Anita. Thanks.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.238
Yeah, see? He got it.
He got it.

19:57.780 --> 19:58.656
All right.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.074
All right, good night,
young fella. Miss.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.826
- Y'all have a good one.
- All right, all right.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.538
Okay, so...

20:05.621 --> 20:06.956
That's Anita.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.165
The Anita that you work with.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.542
That's the Anita.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.919
So, how long have you two
been screwing?

20:12.253 --> 20:13.129
I...

20:13.879 --> 20:14.839
Um.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.173
What you, what you
talkin' 'bout?

20:16.257 --> 20:17.383
Come on, it's obvious.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.593
That woman has it
bad for you.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.846
The only one who can't
see it is her husband.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.973
Okay.

20:24.140 --> 20:27.309
We messed around
for a little bit.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.353
But I broke it off.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.482
Maybe I can
help you keep it off.

20:33.858 --> 20:36.110
Mmm, I like the sound of that.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.611
Way to sell that.

20:37.695 --> 20:38.654
Little you.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.322
Mmm.

20:40.448 --> 20:41.657
Do it again. Do it again.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.451
- I like that.
- You like that?

20:43.534 --> 20:45.411
You know what?
We missed the poetry thing.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.329
But it's not too late
for the Red Lobster.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.330
But it kinda is.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.292
I called my job and told them I was gonna come and work.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.209
Aw.

20:52.293 --> 20:54.170
But I'm off Monday,
if you're free.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.213
Well at least let me give you
a ride to work.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.590
That's really sweet.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.675
My boss is kind of a jerk

20:59.759 --> 21:02.803
and I don't like to mix my personal life with my work,
you know?

21:02.970 --> 21:04.472
Maybe when I know you
a little better.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.015
- Hmm.
- [Laughs]

21:06.098 --> 21:07.141
Okay.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.020
- 'Sup with you, TT?
- What up, y'all?

21:11.103 --> 21:11.937
What up?

21:12.021 --> 21:12.938
Lookin' like money.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.106
You already know.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.025
- [Phone beeps]
- [laughs]

21:20.237 --> 21:21.864
Who you textin'?
Where my text at?

21:21.947 --> 21:23.073
Boy, stop playin'.

21:23.324 --> 21:24.158
Man, whatever.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.409
Man, she just killed you again.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.452
[Chuckles]

21:29.288 --> 21:30.748
What the...
What is this?

21:30.831 --> 21:32.541
- [Rustling]
- No...

21:32.625 --> 21:33.501
God.

21:35.085 --> 21:38.964
Please, Mom. Not... Not my money.
Please, not again.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.299
No.

21:41.091 --> 21:41.967
Damn it.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.346
- Ay, ay.
- Move out of the way.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.555
Ay, you don't need to be
comin' up in here.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.973
I bought this shit today.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.058
[Indistinct mumbling]

21:49.141 --> 21:50.726
Hey. That's my girl.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.186
- Where's my money?
- I don't need it.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.395
You didn't need all
that money, girl.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.563
Damn it, where is it?

21:54.647 --> 21:55.731
- $4,000.
- No.

21:55.815 --> 21:56.899
$4,000.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.401
That was money
I saved up for school.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.987
[All shouting]

22:02.780 --> 22:05.199
Oh. Oh. Oh.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.785
[Tanisha]
You're lucky you're my mom.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.204
You crazy.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.497
What's wrong with you?
Shit.

22:11.580 --> 22:16.752
How could you treat me
like this?

22:16.919 --> 22:17.920
Shit.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.298
[Chuckling]

22:21.882 --> 22:23.050
How you doin' man?
You good?

22:23.133 --> 22:24.176
I'm doin' terrific.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.886
So what'd you think about
my sermon yesterday?

22:25.970 --> 22:28.264
Bishop, I gotta give it to you,
I mean that, that sermon moved me.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.306
I thought it was about me.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.350
It was about you.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.643
Oh, you know you ain't
right for that.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.687
I'm sure you think so.
[Chuckles]

22:35.187 --> 22:37.022
Hey, what you doin' for dinner?
Donna's makin' a roast.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.941
- Come on by the house.
- Ah. Wish I could but...

22:39.650 --> 22:41.485
I got a little company
coming by tonight.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.237
You know you a mess?

22:43.320 --> 22:44.321
Ah, you know how that go.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.907
I'll let you sprinkle some
water on her head soon.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.201
Wha, wha, who's your guest?
Anybody I know?

22:49.285 --> 22:50.369
[Deacon Black]
You don't wanna know.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.122
I'mma pray for you, son.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.709
This looks great.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.294
[Donna] Boy,
you gonna have to have some patience.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.254
Okay, okay. All right.
I'mma catch up with the Bishop.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.797
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll be back. All right.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.840
[Laughing]

23:04.216 --> 23:05.175
Can I help you?

23:05.467 --> 23:06.635
Uh, yeah.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.304
I just wanted to know
if you were free Friday night.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.347
I got tickets
to the Beyoncé concert.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.057
You always loved Beyoncé.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.726
Shorty, you have got to stop.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.978
What part of "not interested"
don't you understand?

23:16.937 --> 23:18.022
Hey, princess.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.148
Oh, hey, Dad.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.691
Ooh. You got it smellin'
mighty good in here.

23:20.774 --> 23:21.692
[Donna]
Thank you.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.277
Hey, Reverend,
you might wanna get a piece of this.

23:23.360 --> 23:27.114
Uh, it's tempting, but I'll
wait until the food is served.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.949
You're a better man than me.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.702
I'm goin' to get some just
like the Bishop do.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.829
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
- Ow. Hey, hey, hey.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.664
I need all y'all
to get out of my kitchen.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.416
- See what you did, Shorty?
- Go.

23:37.666 --> 23:38.751
It'll be done shortly.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.210
Stay in the lane
God put you in, boy.

23:40.294 --> 23:41.253
[Scoffs]

23:41.337 --> 23:44.214
[Dante, sighing] I heard my assistance was required?

23:44.298 --> 23:46.550
Talk to your friend.
He's gettin' on my last nerve.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.968
Well, apparently, it's mutual

23:48.052 --> 23:50.095
'cause I just heard him tell our daddy that he's about to leave.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.598
What's goin' on with
y'all anyway?

23:52.681 --> 23:53.515
Nothin'.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.225
That's the problem, he won't
take no for an answer.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.604
I think he's a little jealous

23:58.687 --> 23:59.938
that you're seein' somebody.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.398
I'll talk to him.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.526
Bless my daughter, Donna, who
made this wonderful meal.

24:04.735 --> 24:05.694
Yes, indeed.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.156
Bless our wonderful family and
our friends who came by today.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.783
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you, Lord.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.577
- Amen.
- [All] Amen.

24:14.036 --> 24:17.039
Deacon and Anita, so nice
for you to join us.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.082
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.375
Dante, you okay?

24:19.792 --> 24:23.420
You hardly touched your candied yams and
we all know how you love candied yams.

24:23.504 --> 24:24.880
[All laughing]

24:25.089 --> 24:26.548
I'm good, Bishop.

24:26.840 --> 24:31.512
Aw, he's probably just pining over that girl he had at bingo last night.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.305
- What girl?
- What girl?

24:33.389 --> 24:35.224
Oh, and she was cute,
First Lady.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.892
[Laughing] Really? Oh.

24:36.975 --> 24:40.312
But I don't know if I'd be bold enough to wear an outfit like that.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.148
You know how these kids
are today.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.983
The need to show skin.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.276
Ain't that right, Donna?

24:48.112 --> 24:49.154
I guess.

24:50.197 --> 24:52.241
Dad, can I get the keys
to your car?

24:52.324 --> 24:54.034
I need to go to Keisha's
to study.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.577
Okay, they in the kitchen.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.497
So sorry to be rude, guys.
College courses.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.292
Well I, for one, am happy
for you, Dante.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.379
The way the two of you
were all hugged up.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.507
Honey, they was just showin' a little affection,
is all.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.176
Right. Affection.
That's the right word.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.553
In church?

25:12.636 --> 25:13.887
Is this true?

25:14.805 --> 25:17.850
It's not what you think, Ma.
I just gave her a little kiss.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.061
Oh, Charlene, don't be
bothered by that.

25:21.145 --> 25:25.816
The only person who didn't think it was innocent was Deaconess Brown.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.025
[Charlene]
Great.

25:27.109 --> 25:30.738
Deaconess Brown was there.
Now the entire church knows.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.658
I thought, you know,
some of the sisters were acting a little funny after service today.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.326
- Charlene.
- What? What?

25:36.410 --> 25:40.748
Look, I talked to Deaconess Brown and I've taken care of it.

25:40.831 --> 25:43.292
- It's okay.
- Oh, you take care of it, so that means you know.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.670
Everyone knows. Wow.
Thank you very much.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.922
Charlene. Now calm down.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

25:49.006 --> 25:52.217
T.K., I do not want to calm down.
Dante knows better than this.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.762
I mean, who is this woman?
Do we know her?

25:54.845 --> 25:56.805
I mean, is she even
a member of this church?

25:56.889 --> 25:59.349
No, ma'am.
I met her a few days ago.

25:59.433 --> 26:00.517
Oh.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.603
That looks all right,
you carrying on like that.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.354
Boy, have you lost your mind?

26:05.606 --> 26:06.648
[Charlene sighs]

26:06.732 --> 26:07.900
Son, you know, uh...

26:08.734 --> 26:11.361
The way a woman presents
herself is very important.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.279
[Anita] Amen.

26:12.362 --> 26:13.655
It's also a reflection on you.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.616
Your father's right, Dante.

26:15.699 --> 26:19.119
Having a cultured woman by your side is
a necessity as you move up in this world.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.496
I mean, just look
at your mother.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.997
Amen, amen.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.999
I, I think I did pretty well.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.043
- Yes, you did, Bishop.
- Indeed.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.628
I appreciate that. Thank you.

26:27.711 --> 26:28.921
To the right woman in your life.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.005
[All chuckle]

26:30.088 --> 26:31.131
Hallelujah.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.371
But I prefer mine walking.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.498
- Ha.
- So...

38:11.581 --> 38:12.540
[Tanisha]
Thank you.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.959
You know damn well what
I'm talking about.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.505
Well, if he's your man,

38:19.047 --> 38:21.424
why is he spending all his time
with me?

38:21.925 --> 38:23.259
- Listen.
- Bitch.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.011
- I got your bitch.
- You need to get up out my face.

38:25.094 --> 38:25.970
[Heated argument]

38:26.054 --> 38:27.722
Woo. Oh.

38:28.389 --> 38:31.059
Oh, this low-class heifer
she, she tried to attack me.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.101
Call the police.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.313
Oh please. I know you started it.
I saw you follow her in here.

38:35.438 --> 38:36.815
I didn't.
I just came into the bathroom.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.275
Let me make one
thing very clear.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.153
The Bishop doesn't like
messiness in his church

38:42.403 --> 38:43.905
and neither does your husband.

38:44.781 --> 38:46.991
Now, do we really
need to go there?

38:48.117 --> 38:50.119
[Scoffing] Didn't think so.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.836
[Door slams]

38:59.420 --> 39:00.964
You must be Tanisha.

39:01.798 --> 39:02.924
Yes.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.093
[Sighs] Dante told me
to look after you.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.388
- I'm Donna, his sister.
- Oh. Nice to meet you.

39:08.471 --> 39:09.681
What'd you do to her?

39:09.764 --> 39:11.474
- Listen.
- [Laughs] Come on.

39:11.558 --> 39:12.809
Thank you for that.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.854
I know people are concerned about gentrification in the neighborhoods,

39:15.937 --> 39:19.107
being pushed out of their homes,
being pushed out of their businesses.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.317
I've decided to throw my hat
in the ring.

39:21.484 --> 39:22.610
I'm running or congressman.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.070
So, you're the first to know,
Mark.

39:24.153 --> 39:26.030
I saw you and my sister
talking too.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.407
That's my girl. [Laughs]

39:27.490 --> 39:29.826
I see why my man is giving up
his players card.

39:30.827 --> 39:33.288
- Tanisha, this is Shorty, my--
- Best friend.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.623
- Oh.
- All day, every day.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.709
All right, well, nice
to meet you, best friend.

39:37.792 --> 39:38.835
Yeah.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.170
You know it seems like, uh,
I know you from somewhere,

39:41.254 --> 39:42.630
have we met before?

39:42.714 --> 39:46.509
Uh, no. Uh-uh.
I would've definitely remembered somebody like you.

39:46.593 --> 39:49.178
You know what,
it might be because y'all are from the same neighborhood.

39:49.304 --> 39:50.305
- Yes.
- That's right.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.681
- Yes, definitely.
- Same neighborhood.

39:51.764 --> 39:53.099
- [Tanisha] Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.935
You know, we gotta get goin'.
We're gonna be late, so, I gotta get Tyrell and--

39:56.019 --> 39:57.270
- Come on, I gotta feed these two, so...
- Okay.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.521
I'll get up with you later,
big dog.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.315
- Absolutely, man, indeed.
- All right, nice to meet you.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.900
- I'll catch up with y'all later.
- [Tanisha] Uh-huh, okay.

40:01.983 --> 40:03.026
[Shorty]
Yeah.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.528
[Hip-hop music playing]

40:10.575 --> 40:12.785
I think one of Dante's friends
recognized me.

40:12.869 --> 40:16.664
And that's the last thing I need is for him,
or his family, to find out I work here.

40:16.748 --> 40:17.665
So what?

40:17.749 --> 40:19.125
You're just doin'
what you gotta do.

40:19.417 --> 40:23.046
Ain't that church people always tryin' to
judge and then tell people don't judge them?

40:23.588 --> 40:25.131
Just tell him you dance.
So what?

40:25.798 --> 40:27.842
Girl, are you crazy?
I can't do that.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.679
- I'mma have to quit.
- So what about school?

40:31.763 --> 40:33.348
What about the money that
your mama took from you?

40:33.431 --> 40:34.557
How you gon' get that back?

40:34.641 --> 40:36.267
I don't know, all right?

40:36.351 --> 40:37.852
I'mma have to figure
something out.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.946
[Laughs]

40:48.571 --> 40:50.239
[Dante]
So, this is it.

40:50.573 --> 40:51.950
Hey.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.620
I'm so glad you could make it.
Welcome to our home.

40:55.703 --> 40:57.205
- I'm here.
- Yes.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.917
Well, just remember my mom trips on the regular,
so don't take anything she says personally.

41:01.334 --> 41:03.002
You really thing she's gonna
say something to me?

41:03.086 --> 41:04.837
- Uh...
- Um...

41:05.672 --> 41:07.465
- You know what? Put this on.
- Yeah.

41:07.548 --> 41:08.675
And I think you'll be okay.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.677
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.387
- I don't...
- Let's get that... Mm-hmm.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.055
Sleeves, no harm in that.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.640
- Cute dress though.
- Thank you.

41:15.723 --> 41:17.308
Let me get the hair for you.
There we go.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.643
- Okay.
- Right?

41:19.018 --> 41:20.728
- Much better.
- Cool. Let's go.

41:20.812 --> 41:21.646
You ready?

41:21.729 --> 41:25.233
Not really, but
we're here, so let's do this.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.151
It's gonna be fine.
Be fine.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.655
All right, Dad, Ma,
I want you to meet Tanisha.

41:30.738 --> 41:33.032
Tanisha, this is my father,
Bishop T.K. Wilson.

41:33.116 --> 41:33.950
Hi.

41:34.033 --> 41:35.493
Hey, Tanisha, glad to meet you.
Call me Bishop.

41:35.576 --> 41:36.703
Nice to meet you, Bishop.

41:36.786 --> 41:38.913
And this is my mother,
First Lady Charlene Wilson.

41:38.997 --> 41:39.872
Come on in and sit down.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.624
Nice to meet you, First Lady.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.085
Time to eat. Sit, dear. Sit.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.004
Come on and sit down and eat.

41:46.087 --> 41:46.921
Okay.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.007
Dante, will you do the honors
of blessing the food?

41:49.090 --> 41:50.425
Of course, Pops.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.011
[Dante] All right.

41:53.094 --> 41:53.928
[Clears throat]

41:55.221 --> 41:57.348
Thank you, Heavenly Father,
for blessing us with this food,

41:57.432 --> 41:58.474
for the caring nourishment
of our body.

41:58.558 --> 41:59.392
Yes, Lord.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.935
Bless the hands that prepared
it as well.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.020
Those are
my mama's hands, Lord.

42:02.103 --> 42:03.062
- Yes.
- Yes, Lord.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.940
And just, we just want to thank you.
In Jesus Christ's name we pray,

42:06.024 --> 42:07.233
- Amen.
- [All] Amen.

42:08.109 --> 42:09.277
[Clears throat]

42:11.863 --> 42:13.823
- Thank you.
- Charlene, this is wonderful.

42:13.906 --> 42:15.366
Thank you, darlin'.

42:16.075 --> 42:17.452
- Mmm.
- This is really good.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.746
Thank you, darlin'.
I appreciate that.

42:19.829 --> 42:22.707
So, Tanisha,
where you from?

42:23.750 --> 42:27.045
I am from the projects right
off of King. Are you familiar?

42:27.128 --> 42:29.380
Yeah, I know.
We have a few parishioners from there.

42:29.464 --> 42:30.590
[T.K.]
Don't we, Charlene?

42:30.673 --> 42:32.133
Uh, yes, we do.

42:32.216 --> 42:35.303
Perhaps you're familiar with
Sister Wilma Johnson?

42:36.596 --> 42:38.890
Hmm. No, sir, that doesn't ring a bell.
I don't think I so.

42:38.973 --> 42:40.600
[T.K.] Maybe you know
Sister Betty Dumpson?

42:40.683 --> 42:42.393
No, sir, I don't know
her either.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.020
You sure you from that area?

42:44.103 --> 42:45.271
[Tanisha, laughing]
I know, right?

42:45.354 --> 42:49.025
Excuse me,
but that Sister Dumpson is raising a lot of cane up over there.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.777
Really? I need to get
to know her.

42:52.361 --> 42:55.281
Is that a tattoo right above
your breast?

42:55.823 --> 42:58.326
Oh, yes, ma'am,
I have three actually.

42:58.409 --> 42:59.577
- Wow.
- I've got this one,

42:59.660 --> 43:02.121
I have one on my neck,
and then I have one that's, you know,

43:02.205 --> 43:03.498
a little undercover, obviously.

43:03.581 --> 43:04.665
[Laughter]

43:04.749 --> 43:06.125
Nobody can see it, though.

43:06.209 --> 43:08.544
Wow. You know, back in my day,

43:08.628 --> 43:11.714
only Jezebels wore tattoos.

43:11.798 --> 43:13.716
Charlene,
we're not back in your day.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.135
Well, that was a different time.

43:16.219 --> 43:17.220
Mm-hmm.

43:17.303 --> 43:19.055
So, Tanisha, do you have
a church home?

43:19.138 --> 43:21.849
Um, no, sir, I don't have a
church home right now.

43:21.933 --> 43:26.020
But, after hearing you speak last week,
I'm thinking about joining First Jamaican Ministry.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.897
You know the doors of the
church are always open.

43:27.980 --> 43:30.566
Thank you.
And Lord knows I need to make use of them.

43:30.650 --> 43:34.779
Now that's the first intelligent
thing I've heard all night.

43:35.321 --> 43:36.364
- [T.K.] Charlene.
- No, honey.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.074
Look, really. No.

43:38.157 --> 43:40.368
Her soul looks like it could
use some cleansing.

43:40.451 --> 43:41.869
[T.K.]
You know what the word says,

43:41.953 --> 43:45.373
"Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone."

43:45.957 --> 43:47.625
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.963
So, dear, um,
did you know that Dante

43:52.046 --> 43:56.676
will be attending Howard University School of Divinity this fall?

43:56.884 --> 43:58.177
He's becoming a minister.

43:58.469 --> 43:59.720
- A minister?
- [Charlene] Yes.

43:59.804 --> 44:00.805
I, um...

44:00.888 --> 44:02.849
I thought you told me you wanted
to be a lawyer.

44:03.432 --> 44:05.810
[Laughing] A lawyer?
God, heavens no.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.687
Dante, what is she
talking about?

44:07.770 --> 44:08.980
Um...

44:09.230 --> 44:11.315
Well, Ma, I've been thinkin'.

44:11.983 --> 44:14.527
Maybe I don't want
to be a preacher.

44:14.986 --> 44:18.114
You've been thinking, huh?
What has gotten into you?

44:18.531 --> 44:21.033
I don't know what it is,
maybe it's this

44:21.868 --> 44:23.786
tramp that you brought into
my own home.

44:23.870 --> 44:25.079
- Ma.
- Okay, that's enough.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.664
No, you need to get your
head on straight.

44:26.747 --> 44:28.040
- Charlene.
- What?

44:28.124 --> 44:29.167
That's not necessary.

44:29.250 --> 44:31.711
T.K., look, no, Dante
needs to hear this.

44:31.794 --> 44:35.006
Dante, of all the nice girls
in the congregation,

44:35.089 --> 44:36.215
you had to bring home this...

44:36.299 --> 44:37.300
What? This tramp?

44:37.383 --> 44:38.551
Yeah, I got it the first time.

44:38.634 --> 44:39.677
Don't let the shoe fit right.

44:39.760 --> 44:40.595
Ma. Wh--

44:40.678 --> 44:41.846
No, no, no. Dante, it is okay.

44:43.890 --> 44:45.808
Donna, it was really nice
seeing you again.

44:46.392 --> 44:48.477
Bishop, thank you
for your hospitality.

44:49.478 --> 44:50.855
- First Lady.
- Yes, dear.

44:51.272 --> 44:53.232
- You have a lovely home.
- Thank you.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.109
Too bad we couldn't get a chance
to know each other better.

44:55.610 --> 44:57.486
Because we both have something
in common.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.615
We both love your son.

45:02.533 --> 45:03.451
Baby, I'll take you home.

45:03.534 --> 45:06.203
No, it's okay, I'll get home.
You eat dinner with your family,

45:06.287 --> 45:08.873
I'm gonna walk home.
I have some things to think about anyway.

45:08.956 --> 45:11.000
Listen, let me apologize for
my wife. She was drinking--

45:11.083 --> 45:11.918
Don't apologize for me.

45:12.001 --> 45:12.960
Dante, go get her.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.337
Hold on.

45:15.296 --> 45:17.840
How do you call yourself
a Christian, Ma?

45:17.924 --> 45:19.342
Who do you think
you're talking to?

45:19.425 --> 45:20.718
I don't know.

45:21.344 --> 45:22.887
Clearly not the woman
who raised me.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.931
She wasn't this tacky
and judgmental.

45:25.640 --> 45:26.599
[Chair slams]

45:26.766 --> 45:27.725
And I'll second that.

45:27.808 --> 45:28.851
[Dante]
Tanisha!

45:28.935 --> 45:31.437
And you wonder why people
are scared of you at church.

45:31.562 --> 45:34.774
Where's the God in you?
Didn't see it tonight.

45:34.857 --> 45:36.484
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

45:38.694 --> 45:39.695
- [Sobbing]
- Hey, hey, hey.

45:39.779 --> 45:41.822
Let me take you home, okay?
No, no, let me take you home.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.033
- Please leave me alone.
- Listen, listen, I'm sorry.

45:44.533 --> 45:46.535
Okay, that's not
a representation of me.

45:46.619 --> 45:48.162
- Let me take you home.
- It wasn't right.

45:48.245 --> 45:51.248
No, it wasn't. Nope and that's
why I'm out here with you.

45:52.249 --> 45:53.376
Do me a favor.

45:53.918 --> 45:56.337
Get in the car.
I'm gonna take you home.

45:57.254 --> 45:58.255
Okay.

45:58.756 --> 45:59.799
Okay?

46:02.843 --> 46:04.220
[Car honks]

46:05.972 --> 46:07.890
[engine starts]

46:10.393 --> 46:11.769
Look, um...

46:12.895 --> 46:14.355
I'm really sorry about all that.

46:15.523 --> 46:19.402
And I don't want all that
to mess up all this.

46:20.444 --> 46:21.529
What we got.

46:22.905 --> 46:25.366
And what is all of this
that we got?

46:26.617 --> 46:29.370
We got us.

46:40.589 --> 46:42.758
[Knock] Hey, TT.
Somethin' goin' on with your moms.

46:42.842 --> 46:45.970
What? What the hell is goin' on?
Oh, my God.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.888
- [Police radio]
- [Elena] I didn't do shit. Stop.

46:47.972 --> 46:49.223
Let me go.

58:02.020 --> 58:04.982
Donna, I have done a lot of
crappy things in my life,

58:05.065 --> 58:07.192
most of which I could care
less about, baby.

58:07.275 --> 58:08.193
You promised.

58:08.276 --> 58:11.863
I know, but this, this, this...
just doesn't feel right.

58:14.533 --> 58:15.993
I'm sure.

58:16.076 --> 58:17.536
[Inhales sharply]

58:20.664 --> 58:22.582
Oh, my goodness.

58:24.710 --> 58:26.545
You're so brave.

58:34.344 --> 58:35.554
[Donna]
I need to talk to my mom.

58:39.182 --> 58:41.226
Wait, Donna, Donna.
Baby, come on, come on.

58:41.309 --> 58:42.644
Are you sure you want to
do this here?

58:42.728 --> 58:44.229
All right, it could get ugly.

58:44.521 --> 58:45.856
This is what I wanna do anyway.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.816
No, no, no. Come on, come on.
Let's get out of here before someone sees.

58:47.899 --> 58:50.110
Now you can always talk to
your mother later.

58:50.569 --> 58:51.695
In private. Come on.

58:51.778 --> 58:53.780
- Donna?
- Dante.

58:53.864 --> 58:55.949
Hey. You had all of us
worried, girl.

58:56.033 --> 58:57.159
I'm here for you, baby.

58:58.577 --> 59:00.370
Listen, Ma said
you're pregnant.

59:00.454 --> 59:04.124
Did she also tell you she kicked me out of the
house and she wants me to get an abortion?

59:04.207 --> 59:05.042
What?

59:06.084 --> 59:08.003
Aw, this mess can wait.

59:08.086 --> 59:09.254
You--

59:10.464 --> 59:12.215
What's going on in there?

59:12.758 --> 59:13.884
Oh, you don't know?

59:13.967 --> 59:16.970
Reverend Ronald messed around and
got himself married over the weekend.

59:17.054 --> 59:18.889
Daughter of some big preacher.

59:19.431 --> 59:20.474
Married?

59:27.022 --> 59:29.232
Hey, Donna.
You don't have to do this.

59:29.691 --> 59:31.610
Reverend Reynolds
is getting married.

59:31.902 --> 59:33.570
I have to pay
my proper respect.

59:34.112 --> 59:35.238
You dropped your necklace.

59:35.322 --> 59:37.199
Donna, are you okay?
You don't look okay.

59:37.616 --> 59:38.867
Oh, really? I feel good.

59:38.950 --> 59:40.452
Now, if you'll excuse me.

59:41.078 --> 59:42.245
Donna. Hi.

59:42.329 --> 59:44.081
Hey. Donna. How are you?

59:44.164 --> 59:46.875
I'm good.
Well, I hear congratulations are in order?

59:47.751 --> 59:49.878
Yes. Shawna, my wife.

59:49.961 --> 59:52.714
Shawna, Donna Wilson,
the Bishop and First Lady's daughter.

59:52.798 --> 59:53.673
Pleased to meet you, Donna.

59:53.757 --> 59:56.051
Nice to meet you and I hope
we can become great friends.

59:56.343 --> 59:57.928
I'm sure we have a lot in
common.

59:58.011 --> 59:59.387
Oh, I'd like that.

59:59.471 --> 01:00:01.181
You know what?
Let me take you out.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.391
If that's okay with
Reverend Reynolds.

01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:04.893
Whoa, of course.

01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:08.438
I mean,
we'll probably be spending most of our time with other married couples.

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:10.190
Ah. Well, isn't that
a coincidence?

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:13.110
My fiancé and I were looking for a couple to hang out with as well.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:15.195
- Fiancé?
- Yes.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.155
Someone proposed to me too.

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:18.240
And who is that, Donna?

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:20.033
Well, who might
be the lucky guy?

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.202
- Shorty.
- Shorty?

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.453
Shorty proposed.

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:24.746
[Laughing]

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:28.125
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:29.126
Congratulations.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:30.043
You know anything about this?

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.128
Congratulations.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:36.383
Shorty...

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:39.136
Are you the father
of Donna's baby?

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.307
I asked you, are you--

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:45.517
Yes.

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:47.394
Shorty's the father.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:50.021
Good Lord.
Why are you torturing us so?

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:51.773
No one is torturing you, Mother.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.441
Why can't you just be
happy for us?

01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:54.860
'Cause he's trifling.

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:57.737
And I will not have him humiliate me with his trifling ways.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:58.947
And neither will you.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.657
- Charlene, stop.
- What, what?

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.118
That's enough.
'Cause now is not the time.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:07.873
They are gonna have a hard enough
time raising a baby and finishing school.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.167
They need our support.

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.423
Donna,

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:18.258
do you w and to marry Shorty?

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:20.844
[T.K.] Are you sure?

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:23.722
Yes, Daddy, I'm sure.

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:25.932
What about you?

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:30.270
Look, I love Donna.
I always have.

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:34.357
[T.K.] Now is your chance
to prove it.

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:37.444
Welcome to the family.

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:42.574
[T.K.] Listen, Shorty.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.368
This is my only daughter,

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.622
and I love her.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:52.542
You take good care of her.
You hear me?

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.378
Yes, sir.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:56.838
[T.K.] Okay.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:01.051
It's gonna be fine.
It's in God's hands.

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:03.595
Yeah. Okay.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:10.769
Dante, I need your support.

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.437
Shorty is your boy.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.647
Exactly.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.358
I don't support this.
And I don't want to go.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:18.693
Can you do it for me?

01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:21.446
- I need--
- [knocking]

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:23.865
Dante, have you s--
Ah, Donna, there you are.

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:27.452
Your father asked me to talk to you and
Shorty about your pre-marriage counseling.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:28.411
Got a minute?

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:31.248
That's my cue.
I need some air anyway. Um...

01:02:33.124 --> 01:02:34.960
I'mma go. For you.

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.503
Thank you.

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.469
Donna, you can't keep
avoiding me.

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:46.972
How's your wife?

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:50.725
Look, you can't marry Shorty.
I won't allow it.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:52.727
"Won't allow it"?

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:54.479
You don't love him.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:55.605
You love me.

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:56.982
Don't you dare touch me.

01:02:57.565 --> 01:02:59.150
I don't deserve this.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:01.653
You didn't even have the
decency to tell me.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:04.864
I wanted to tell you myself.
In private.

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:08.368
No. You wanted to continue
to play me for a fool.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.704
No, I didn't want you
to make a scene.

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:12.914
It would've meant a scene,
all right.

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:18.837
How could you cheat on me?

01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:22.424
I was cheating on her, not you.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.431
Do you love her?

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.477
[Stammering]
We make a good team.

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:36.229
We...

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.106
We work well together.

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:42.152
She's from a very powerful family and I want my own church someday.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.528
She can help me get that.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.906
I asked, do you love her?

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:51.161
I did.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.122
Until I fell in love with you.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:57.625
Oh, God.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:01.296
I've got to be the world's
biggest fool.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.594
We need to talk
for a second, man.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:09.846
Yeah, sure.
Wh-wh-what's up?

01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:11.890
[Clears throat]

01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:13.099
Been tryin' to...

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:18.480
figure out the right time and place to talk to you about this situation.

01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:19.814
Man to man.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:22.859
Yeah. Did your, uh,
sister ask you about being my best man?

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:26.780
Told her no.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.158
How could you?

01:04:31.326 --> 01:04:33.453
You're supposed to be my boy.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.331
- Dante, you gotta list--
- No, no, no, no.

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:39.417
How could you do
my sister, man?

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:43.880
D, it's not what it looks like,
man, trust me, bro.

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:45.131
I trusted you.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.008
My family trusted you.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:49.594
D, you...

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:52.472
You know I would not
hurt you, man.

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:54.682
The damage is done, Shorty.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.601
It's a little too late for that.

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:03.691
Shorty, out of all the women
that you know,

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.361
Instagram models, strippers,

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:07.612
you couldn't
go get one of them,

01:05:07.695 --> 01:05:10.448
you had to go get
my baby sister.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.577
You know I've loved Donna
for a long time.

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:16.663
I don't wanna--
I don't wanna hear that.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:19.541
Love?

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:24.546
You knocked her up,
behind my back, like a coward.

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:26.131
D, I'm not a coward.

01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:27.257
I'm tryin' to do right by her.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.008
So I'mma be here,
so you got to deal with it.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.219
[Groaning]

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:32.137
Yeah.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.139
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey,
what's goin' on, fellas?

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:37.517
I have a question to ask you.
Your father said that you're pregnant?

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.726
And?

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:40.770
It's my baby, isn't it?

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:43.898
I-I thought you said
you were on the pill.

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:45.608
Obviously, it didn't work.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.780
Well, you can't marry him.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:53.783
I can't bear the thought of
another man raising my child.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.536
Well then, prove it.

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:59.414
Leave her.
Marry me, Terrance.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:02.000
We can raise our baby together.

01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:05.920
Together.

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:09.299
I can't do that, Donna.
Not right now.

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.676
I have too much riding
on this marriage.

01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:14.053
But I'll take care of the baby,
I promise you.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.222
Just, please, don't get married.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.476
Do you expect me to be
an un-wed mother?

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:21.394
Are you crazy?

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.439
I can't do that to my family
or my baby.

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:26.733
Please, Donna. I love you.

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:29.068
- Selfish son of a--
- Please.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.695
Donna.

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:39.120
Don't you ever touch me again.

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:42.957
I'm marrying Shorty, and there's
nothing you can do to stop me.

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.543
Damn it, Donna, don't do this.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:53.301
[Door slams]

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:55.512
[sobbing]

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.223
You look amazing.
What do you mean you don't feel confident?

01:06:58.306 --> 01:06:59.474
I don't know. I just--

01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:02.685
Well, you would say that. But do I really have to go?
You really want me there?

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:03.978
I want you there.

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:05.271
My mom's not gonna trip.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.315
If she starts,
we'll leave, I promise.

01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:08.483
- Promise?
- Promise.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:10.401
So, how are you gonna act
when you see your boy?

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:13.613
I ain't got nothin' to say
to Shorty.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.824
After a couple drinks,
you're not gonna go Mike Tyson on him, are you?

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:19.494
- Mayweather.
- Oh, my God. See?

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:21.871
Baby I'm kidding.
I ain't messin' up my suit.

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:24.040
- I'm too sharp to be fightin'.
- You do look good.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:25.625
Thank you, so do you.
Let's go.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:26.543

01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:51.041
That is beautiful.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:51.959
Yeah.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.378
I guess I'll hold it for yours.

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:56.589
One day when you get married.

01:17:56.714 --> 01:17:57.840
[Both chuckle]

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:02.678
What? Something wrong?

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:05.055
Won't be any time soon.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:07.516
You know, Bishop and I...

01:18:08.058 --> 01:18:09.393
We were remarking that, uh...

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:12.980
Tanisha seems to have
settled you right on down.

01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:14.231
Ah.

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:15.900
Tanisha...

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:18.194
isn't who you think she is.

01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:19.320
[Charlene]
Mmm.

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:21.030
She isn't who
I thought she was.

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:24.241
Just found out she was
a stripper, Ma.

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:28.370
Is she a stripper?
Or was a stripper?

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:30.080
See, 'cause I heard that
she had stopped.

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:32.374
You heard? How did you hear?
How do you know that?

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:33.292
Oh, honey.

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:36.670
Is she still strippin'?

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.172
I don't know...

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:39.506
I hope not, but I--

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:40.841
[phone ringing]

01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:43.594
- Right on cue.
- [Charlene chuckles]

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:44.845
Saved by the bell.

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:46.764
Hello?

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:48.390
What?

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:49.975
Hold on, we're on the way.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:50.976
Right now,
we on the way.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:51.894
- Come on.
- What?

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:52.978
Donna's in the hospital,
come on.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:53.979
Donna's in the hospital? What?

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:58.567
Look, there was blood everywhere, man,
we were scared.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:00.277
If it wasn't for Tanisha
- I don't even know--

01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:01.320
Tanisha?

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:03.072
Yeah, man,
I tried to run and get you.

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:04.323
Tanisha took charge.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:06.617
She calmed down Donna
while the paramedics came.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:07.868
She called them.

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:11.872
Hey, you okay?

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.125
She's going to be fine.

01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:16.710
The stress of the wedding is

01:19:16.794 --> 01:19:18.420
probably what
caused the spotting.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:19.880
And the shower
made it look like

01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:21.215
more blood than
it actually was.

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:22.424
What about the baby?

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:23.676
The baby's fine, sir.

01:19:25.219 --> 01:19:26.470
[Doctor]
I'll be outside if you need me.

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:28.222
Thank you, doctor.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:29.723
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:34.103
So did you hear that, princess?

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:37.398
Gonna be just fine.
It's all in God's hand's now.

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:40.234
Where's Tanisha?

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:43.070
Look, don't you worry
about that, okay?

01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:44.196
You just rest.

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:46.532
Dante, I hope you
didn't mess up.

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.659
She's a special girl.

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:50.577
Okay, you don't know what
you're talking about.

01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:52.788
She's not the little angel
everybody thinks she is.

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:54.957
No one cares
that she used to strip.

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:58.252
You love her, she loves you.
That is all that matters.

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:01.171
What the hell? Does everybody
know she's a stripper?

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:04.758
[Quiet affirmations]

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:08.387
Honey, she's a good woman

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:11.640
who has done absolutely
everything to change her life.

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.475
She deserves a good man.

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:16.186
[Charlene]
Come here.

01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:18.564
Please don't be like me.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.107
So caught up in what other
people think

01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:21.817
you stop following your heart.

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:25.237
[Dante]
Hm.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:28.574
Go find that woman.

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:31.660
Ma.

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:33.829
Yeah.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:39.418
- Love you, Ma.
- I love you more.

01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:10.616
Dante, what are you doing here?

01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:14.328
I figured I'd find you here.
Come here.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:18.082
Come here.

01:21:27.424 --> 01:21:29.051
I said some mean things

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.428
about your past and I'm sorry.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.473
Regardless of what you
used to be or used to do,

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:36.934
I love you.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.105
- Dante, I'm sorr--
- Shh, shh.

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:43.357
Will you...

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:45.442
marry me?

01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:47.528
Yes.

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:48.654
Oh...

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:51.657
Yes.

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:01.250
But I don't want you strippin'
for nobody else but me.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.085
- Nobody but you.
- Okay.

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:04.169
[Tanisha chuckles]

01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:05.671
Ahh.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.844
That's right, hold it up.
Let the world see it.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.893
[Natasha]
Biiiitch, you look good.

01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:21.478
We're in church.
Can you please just--

01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:22.396
Can you act--

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:24.398
- Can you put on good Natasha for me today?
- [Knocking on door]

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:26.024
- Yes.
- Thank you.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:27.109
Who is it?

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.570
It's Tyrell.
I got something for my sister.

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:31.905
Yes, please. Yes.

01:22:33.824 --> 01:22:37.202
Aw, look at my brother.
You look so handsome.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.371
- You look great, too.
- Thank you.

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.081
[Tyrell]
I got something for you.

01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:43.625
Mommy.

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:46.587
Oh, my God. Look at you.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:48.964
Look how beautiful you look.

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:52.134
Me? Look at you.
You look incredible.

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:53.927
- How did you even get out?
- Oh.

01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:55.721
Early release
for good behavior.

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:57.764
And this,

01:22:57.848 --> 01:22:59.475
this is all Dante.

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.144
Did you know he was visiting me
every week?

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:03.145
No.

01:23:03.604 --> 01:23:05.731
And he asked me for your hand.

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:09.985
Oh, my...
I can't believe you just...

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:12.070
I'm so happy.

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:14.239
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:18.243
Do you, Tanisha Jones,

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.913
take, my son,

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:23.332
to be your lawfully
wedded husband

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.919
to have, to hold, to cherish

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.086
and to honor--

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:29.338
And obey.

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:32.174
[T.K.] And obey.

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:34.092
As long as you both do live?

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:36.595
I do, I do, I do.

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.805
[R&B music playing]

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.851
By the power of the Almighty

01:23:44.061 --> 01:23:45.521
and the power vested in me,

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:47.856
I now pronounce you man--

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:49.399
- No, no, stop, stop.
- [Tanisha] Mommy!

01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:51.485
No, you can't marry him.

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:53.445
- What are you doing?
- No, you can't marry him!

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.072
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Now, ma'am,

01:23:55.155 --> 01:23:56.615
why can't they marry?

01:23:57.616 --> 01:23:59.368
That's your father, Tanisha.

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:00.827
- What?
- What?

01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:04.498
Elena?

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:08.710
- Is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:10.420
Oh, my God.

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:12.756
What are you doing here?

01:24:13.257 --> 01:24:14.967
Are you kidding me?

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:17.302
Are you kidding me?

01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:18.554
Really?

01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:21.515
[Dante] Ma.

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:24.393
Tanisha. No, baby, baby.

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:26.103
Wait a minute, baby, I'm sorry.

01:24:26.603 --> 01:24:28.480
I'm sorry, baby.

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:39.700
[Charlene]
It's gonna be fine, guys.

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:41.201
- Fine?
- Yes, baby.

01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:43.579
Come on, you shouldn't be
on your feet for too long.

01:24:44.037 --> 01:24:45.205
I don't want
to sit down right now.

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:48.458
Madonna, please sit down
before you lose the baby.

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:50.335
Fine.

01:24:55.382 --> 01:24:56.675
Um,

01:24:56.967 --> 01:24:58.427
I know it's been a long day,

01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:01.179
and want you all to know that
I'm withdrawing from the race.

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:02.806
Bishop, no.

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:04.683
With all the stuff
that's going on.

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:05.976
That's it.

01:25:06.518 --> 01:25:08.687
Hm? That's all you have to say?

01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:10.105
That's all for now, Dante.

01:25:10.188 --> 01:25:13.066
You're supposed to be a man of God,
you fake bastard.

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:14.985
- Dante.
- Ma, no.

01:25:15.485 --> 01:25:17.404
How long you been screwing
around on my mother?

01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:18.947
And how many other
brothers and sisters

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:20.657
we got floatin'
around out here?

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:22.701
I will talk to you about that
later. Now--

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:24.411
- Answer me!
- Dante, plea--

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:25.912
Yo, that's your pops.

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:29.416
That's Deacon Black
and Deaconess Brown.

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:30.751
It's okay, let them in, dear.

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:32.919
[T.K.] Just calm down,
it's gonna be fine.

01:25:33.003 --> 01:25:34.755
I want you to get a chance
to talk to him, okay?

01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:35.672
Yeah.

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:36.632
[Deacon Black] Hey.

01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:38.133
Good to see you.

01:25:38.216 --> 01:25:39.635
- We just left the Deacons' board.
- All right.

01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:40.594
Hey, Bishop.

01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:42.804
Reverend Reynolds called
an emergency meeting.

01:25:42.888 --> 01:25:45.140
That's good, at least he's
doing some damage control.

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:46.933
Bishop, he's asked the board
to fire you.

01:25:47.017 --> 01:25:47.893
[Charlene] What?

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:50.687
- They can't do this.
- No, they can't.

01:25:51.271 --> 01:25:52.606
According to the bylaws,

01:25:52.689 --> 01:25:54.650
they have to have
an open meeting

01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:57.110
and have me or someone else
speak on my behalf.

01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:59.196
Yes, but they can still
suspend you without--

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:01.114
And who is going run the church
until then?

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:03.742
Well, that's officially why
we're here, First Lady Wilson.

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:06.036
Reverend Winnels has been
named acting pastor.

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:07.913
I believe he and his wife
want your jobs.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.213
Bishop, you've heard

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:18.715
the opinions and accusations

01:26:19.049 --> 01:26:22.135
and you know there's a motion
to have you removed as pastor.

01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:27.057
Before we vote, we would like
to give you the opportunity

01:26:27.557 --> 01:26:28.767
to make a statement.

01:26:32.354 --> 01:26:33.313
Amen.

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:35.023
Reverend.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:39.236
Uh, to the board
and to the members

01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:40.904
that are here,

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:43.657
uh, I've prepared
a brief statement,

01:26:44.658 --> 01:26:46.576
but I will not be
answering any questions.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:49.079
I think you owe us all
an explanation

01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:50.497
for your infidelity

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:53.083
and for the embarrassment
you brought down on this church.

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:55.210
All due respect, Reverend,

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:58.171
I don't think I owe anybody
any explanations.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.881
Maybe my wife.

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:01.425
Maybe my family.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.135
My son and my daughter.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:05.846
But the only person
I feel like

01:27:05.929 --> 01:27:08.765
I owe an explanation to,
really, is God.

01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:10.976
[Congregation murmurs]

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:14.438
As you know, I have...

01:27:15.689 --> 01:27:17.441
served this church faithfully

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:19.192
for 17 years.

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:22.821
And in those 17 years,
we've done some good work here

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:24.489
in the community,
in this church,

01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:26.450
and all around this city.

01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:27.534
[Congregation] Amen.

01:27:28.618 --> 01:27:30.579
I want to say that, um...

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:33.123
I want to say that this church,

01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:35.250
this church has been my life.

01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:36.710
That's right.

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:39.421
And I am sorry
for any indiscretions...

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:42.340
that may have
caused you some pain.

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.510
But I will not stand here
before you...

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:47.721
and deny my daughter.

01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:51.683
So you admit that
she is your daughter.

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:54.102
Yeah, Reverend,
that's my daughter.

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:55.854
Then that makes
you an adulterer

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:58.273
and unfit to lead
this congregation.

01:27:59.483 --> 01:28:00.609
Hm.

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:02.944
[T.K.] Let me say this
to you all.

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:05.197
I swear

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.531
right here before you all

01:28:07.073 --> 01:28:08.658
and my Lord and master

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:10.911
that I have never...

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:13.038
committed adultery.

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:14.831
Now,

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:18.251
fire me if that's
what you decide.

01:28:18.919 --> 01:28:20.212
But I am at peace...

01:28:20.837 --> 01:28:22.547
knowing that
my conscience is clear.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:23.548
Amen.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:25.091
And I am right with my God.

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:26.384
[All murmuring]

01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:27.427
Thank you.

01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:28.345
[Applause]

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:36.853
We need order, we need order.

01:28:36.937 --> 01:28:38.146
There's still a motion
on the floor

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:39.314
and we still need
to take a vote.

01:28:39.773 --> 01:28:42.943
I'd, uh, like to say something.

01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:45.946
We know that you have to
defend your husband

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:49.616
but he has embarrassed
this church and wronged you.

01:28:49.699 --> 01:28:51.243
- We are only--
- Please, do not.

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:53.662
Don't try to act like
you're defending my honor.

01:28:54.412 --> 01:28:55.413
Judas.

01:28:58.083 --> 01:29:00.126
If you would all in-, uh,

01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:02.045
indulge me, I'd like to

01:29:02.128 --> 01:29:03.255
[sighs]

01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:05.006
share a story.

01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:07.717
- Deacon what does this have to do--
- Reverend Reynolds.

01:29:07.801 --> 01:29:09.845
Please allow the
First Lady to speak.

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:11.096
Thank you.

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.597
[Congregation affirms]

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:14.015
[Charlene]
Thank you, thank you.

01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:16.268
The story, um,
uh, concerns, uh,

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:18.436
a young man in Virginia.

01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:21.273
He was not a member
of a church.

01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:23.275
He worshiped crack cocaine

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:26.653
He and his woman were
totally addicted.

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:30.991
The woman had a very
bad reaction to the drugs

01:29:31.074 --> 01:29:33.285
and slipped
into unconsciousness.

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:35.161
The young man feared

01:29:35.662 --> 01:29:36.955
that she would die,

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:39.124
so he ran for help.

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:41.960
He found in a church
where a visiting minister

01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:43.295
offered his assistance.

01:29:44.129 --> 01:29:47.215
And he and that minister
took that woman to the hospital

01:29:47.299 --> 01:29:49.050
and most likely saved her life.

01:29:49.634 --> 01:29:52.387
She remained in a coma
for about three weeks,

01:29:52.679 --> 01:29:54.014
and every day

01:29:54.556 --> 01:29:57.058
that minister
and that young man

01:29:58.184 --> 01:29:59.436
they prayed for her.

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:02.314
The minister also,

01:30:02.856 --> 01:30:04.065
he prayed for that young man

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:07.527
because he, too, was fighting
against his own habits and...

01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:11.156
suffering from withdrawals
from his own addictions.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:14.618
- Now, we all know God is good, amen?
- Amen.

01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:18.204
- And we all know that he has his prayers, amen?
- Amen.

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.456
And in two weeks

01:30:19.789 --> 01:30:23.585
that young man conquered
his addictions

01:30:24.628 --> 01:30:25.879
and found the Lord.

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:28.089
Young man went home,

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:30.842
to his woman, but his
woman was not ready.

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:33.303
And just as he was praying
for her to please

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:35.388
put down the drugs
and follow the Lord.

01:30:35.472 --> 01:30:38.391
She was praying to him
and begging him

01:30:38.475 --> 01:30:41.061
to put down God
and get back to partying.

01:30:41.144 --> 01:30:42.729
[Congregation murmurs]

01:30:43.396 --> 01:30:44.564
The young man

01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:47.192
knew that he was in danger

01:30:47.817 --> 01:30:49.486
of losing his life...

01:30:50.612 --> 01:30:52.113
and so he asked that minister,

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:54.908
could he go with him,
back to his own church?

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.701
Of course,
the minister said yes.

01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.454
So he left his woman,

01:31:00.038 --> 01:31:03.124
and followed the path that
the Lord had set before him.

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:04.918
[Congregation murmurs]

01:31:05.418 --> 01:31:06.252
Now, the minister,

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:08.338
he had a child.

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:10.548
She got pregnant.

01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:12.676
Even worse,
she had so many men,

01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:15.970
she had no idea
who the father of the baby was.

01:31:17.597 --> 01:31:19.891
As you can all figure
out right now

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:21.851
that the young man
I am speaking of

01:31:21.935 --> 01:31:23.728
is our very own pastor,

01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:27.649
Bishop T.K. Wilson.

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:31.778
The minister was my father.

01:31:33.405 --> 01:31:35.115
And the wayward child...

01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:38.743
was me.

01:31:41.705 --> 01:31:42.872
[Woman] It's all right.

01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:47.377
My father was devastated
when I got pregnant.

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:48.920
I could've destroyed

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:51.297
his fledgling church
that he had started.

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:54.342
T.K. offered to marry me

01:31:55.552 --> 01:31:58.388
and raise my son as his.

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:03.768
And I protested very loudly at first,
but of course I agreed.

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.438
And it has been 26
of the most blessed life

01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:07.856
a woman could ask for.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.817
He raised my son as his

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:13.528
and that young man you all know

01:32:14.237 --> 01:32:16.030
is Dante Wilson.

01:32:19.826 --> 01:32:21.286
[Reverend Reynolds] That does not alter the fact

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.580
that he had child
out of wedlock.

01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:28.543
He only learned of her
existence when we all did.

01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:33.590
And with God's help, he is
ready to build a relationship

01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:35.967
with her and even help her
mother stay off drugs.

01:32:36.843 --> 01:32:38.762
Amen. [Applause]

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:42.682
My husband is
a true man of God,

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:45.727
and he has dedicated his life
to this church

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:47.395
that he helped build

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:49.439
to what it is today

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:52.150
He does not deserve
to be fired.

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:54.903
Thank you.

01:33:04.829 --> 01:33:06.790
I would like to say something.

01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:11.669
Even if you all believe

01:33:12.128 --> 01:33:15.340
that the Bishop had
no knowledge of his child,

01:33:15.799 --> 01:33:17.717
the damage is done.

01:33:18.301 --> 01:33:21.137
All the stories that
are circulating

01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:23.223
about our adulterous leader,

01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:25.433
they have cause to undermine

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:28.311
all of the good work that
this church has tried

01:33:28.394 --> 01:33:29.479
to do in the community

01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:31.856
We cannot support a Bishop

01:33:32.482 --> 01:33:35.151
who will father a child
out of wedlock.

01:33:35.485 --> 01:33:37.529
- It's against--
- Terrance, stop it.

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:40.657
I'm not going let you get away
with this any longer.

01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:41.991
Go ahead, baby.

01:33:42.075 --> 01:33:44.244
How dare you try to have
my father removed

01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:47.080
for having a child out of
wedlock almost 30 years ago?

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:49.415
I think there's one
more thing the church

01:33:49.499 --> 01:33:50.667
should know about
before they vote.

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:54.295
- This is highly irr--
- Let her speak, Reverend.

01:33:54.379 --> 01:33:57.006
Why don't you tell everyone
who my baby's father is?

01:33:57.674 --> 01:33:58.675
Tell them.

01:33:59.092 --> 01:34:00.635
Tell them how you went
behind my father's back,

01:34:00.718 --> 01:34:02.887
impregnated me, then ran off
and married another woman.

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:04.305
[All exclaiming]

01:34:04.389 --> 01:34:05.682
She's lying--

01:34:05.765 --> 01:34:07.141
This is house of the Lord,

01:34:07.225 --> 01:34:09.519
and you know damn well
this is your child.

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:13.189
This is a ploy.
Can't y'all see that?

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:16.192
This family has been plagued

01:34:16.276 --> 01:34:17.819
with a generational curse.

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:19.946
We need to vote immediately

01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:22.198
to remove them from the
leadership of our church

01:34:22.282 --> 01:34:23.825
and restore the good name

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:25.827
of this church back into
the community.

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:27.537
Terrance.

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.706
Why are you kissing her
in this picture?

01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:30.707
[Crowd exclaims]

01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:32.125
[Deacon Black]
Let me see those pictures.

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:35.628
That's you. That's you.
This is him.

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:37.755
And before you lie,

01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:40.925
there's a date
on the photo.

01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:43.094
The same date

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:47.015
when I went looking for
my bridal gown.

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:48.308
[All exclaiming]

01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:50.810
Deacon Black, we are not
here to talk about me.

01:34:50.894 --> 01:34:52.437
We are here to talk about--

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.188
Reverend Reynolds...

01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:57.567
I think we've heard just about
enough from you for one day.

01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:59.402
This meeting
is adjourned, brother.

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:02.614
[Applause]

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:06.451
I guess we still have to
put this to a vote.

01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:08.244
But before we do,

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:11.623
I would ask that you
long-term members...

01:35:11.915 --> 01:35:15.585
recall just how much
this church has grown

01:35:15.668 --> 01:35:18.296
under Bishop Wilson's guidance.

01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:21.299
Now I know you've heard about

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:24.761
all this media attention
and what people outside

01:35:25.428 --> 01:35:27.931
First Jamaica Church
are saying about us.

01:35:28.765 --> 01:35:30.224
But to hell with the media.

01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:31.309
[Cheers]

01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:32.894
Forget the gossip.

01:35:32.977 --> 01:35:35.939
- I say we let the Bishop stay.
- [Cheers]
