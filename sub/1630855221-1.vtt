WEBVTT

00:12.882 --> 00:13.665
Hm.

00:15.537 --> 00:16.364
Hi, Mom.

00:18.453 --> 00:19.889
I just finished at the gym.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.674
I did a spin class
and a full circuit.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.285
I'm exhausted and
I need to eat.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.113
Yes.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.419
Mom, I'm taking this
pageant seriously.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.378
Literally, I am so
dizzy and all I've had

00:30.508 --> 00:31.988
to eat today is a
stick of celery.

00:33.468 --> 00:33.946
What- whatever.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.861
Mom. Mom, I gotta go.

00:37.907 --> 00:42.390
Harper, what a surprise.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.479
I haven't seen you
at the gym in months.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.221
Adeline, I'm here every day.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.919
Guess we must be on
different schedules then.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.401
You know, Lilliana, she's
been working out twice a day

00:53.531 --> 00:55.707
for months to prepare
for the pageant.

00:55.838 --> 00:56.839
Oh.

00:56.969 --> 00:58.362
Well, I gotta get going.

00:58.493 --> 01:00.190
Where are you rushing off to?

01:00.321 --> 01:02.279
Just dinner with some friends.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.369
Oh, it's kind of late for
a meal, don't you think?

01:05.500 --> 01:06.240
Most of the girls just chew

01:06.370 --> 01:08.024
on an almond when
they get hungry.

01:08.851 --> 01:10.200
At least, the winners do.

01:12.289 --> 01:13.812
Have you been jogging?

01:13.943 --> 01:15.031
No. Why?

01:15.162 --> 01:18.556
Oh, you're just so
sweaty and out of breath.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.906
Guess it was a little strenuous
getting outta your car.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.388
You remind me so
much of your mother.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.477
Really? How so?

01:27.957 --> 01:31.003
Well, when I competed
against her, many years ago,

01:31.134 --> 01:33.919
she lacked the discipline
needed for pageants.

01:35.225 --> 01:37.619
That's funny, because
if I remember correctly,

01:37.749 --> 01:40.883
she beat you, several
times in fact.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.887
Sometimes people find
other ways of winning,

01:45.017 --> 01:47.628
especially when there's a male
judge open to being swayed.

01:49.239 --> 01:50.893
Are you insinuating
that my mother

01:51.023 --> 01:52.460
slept her way to a crown?

01:52.590 --> 01:55.941
There's no insinuation,
honey, she did,

01:56.072 --> 01:58.466
and that's why you
remind me so much of her.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.426
You know, Adeline, you
walk around like you own

02:02.557 --> 02:05.603
the pageant world, but the
truth is, is you're a joke.

02:05.734 --> 02:09.693
You've never even won a
title, but your mother has.

02:09.824 --> 02:11.653
And the only reason
that you continue

02:11.783 --> 02:14.656
to stay relevant is because
she funds the whole thing.

02:15.831 --> 02:19.835
How sad, Mommy pays
so you can play.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.532
How dare you talk
to me like that?

02:21.663 --> 02:25.841
Oh my God, did you just
put your hands on me?

02:25.971 --> 02:28.844
Oh, I'm gonna sue you for
everything that you've got.

02:28.974 --> 02:29.671
Oh, wait.

02:29.801 --> 02:30.976
Oh, you don't have anything,

02:31.107 --> 02:32.108
because Mommy owns it all.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.718
Shut the hell up, Harper.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.459
Oh, yeah? Or what?

02:35.590 --> 02:37.548
God, you're pathetic, Adeline.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.508
Your daughter knows it,
your mother knows it,

02:40.638 --> 02:42.336
even your husband knew it.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.599
That's why he finally
dumped your sorry-

02:53.695 --> 02:54.130
Oh no.

03:08.884 --> 03:09.972
No.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.576
No, it's not okay.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.491
Why wasn't this
problem flagged before?

03:51.970 --> 03:54.103
We were supposed to have
our grand opening next week?

03:56.975 --> 03:58.107
Sure. Thanks.

04:00.457 --> 04:01.589
Mom, what's going on?

04:02.329 --> 04:04.940
The building inspector
came out to give the okay

04:05.070 --> 04:06.202
so that I could open the spa,

04:06.333 --> 04:08.987
but we didn't get the approval.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.641
What? Why?

04:10.772 --> 04:12.513
Apparently, there was
some structural damage

04:12.643 --> 04:14.776
that was missed in the
original inspection.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.821
Now they're saying we can't
open until all the repairs

04:16.952 --> 04:19.346
are complete, which could
take at least six weeks.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.825
That's awful, Mom.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.218
Is there anything I can do?

04:23.567 --> 04:25.003
I wish there was, sweetie.

04:26.178 --> 04:28.529
I'm just happy to
see you.

04:28.659 --> 04:31.053
Which I thought you had to
be at school until 6:00.

04:31.183 --> 04:34.622
I, I finished my project early
and I got some good news,

04:34.752 --> 04:36.232
so I decided to rush home.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.454
Well, what is it?

04:40.584 --> 04:42.020
You know that literature
residency program

04:42.151 --> 04:43.805
I talked to you about?

04:43.935 --> 04:45.197
Yes.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.242
They picked me to go.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.679
Ah! Yes!

04:48.810 --> 04:50.725
That means I would get to
spend my first semester

04:50.855 --> 04:51.769
in college in London.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.990
Ah, sweetie, that's amazing.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.472
But, but I, I, I
can't accept it, Mom.

04:59.995 --> 05:00.822
Well, why not?

05:02.345 --> 05:05.261
Because the program
itself, it, it costs money.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.829
And housing isn't cheap.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.614
Without the spa being
able to open up,

05:10.745 --> 05:13.617
you know, I didn't...

05:13.748 --> 05:15.010
Maybe we can get a loan.

05:16.272 --> 05:17.969
But I thought with
all the medical bills

05:18.100 --> 05:21.059
from dad and the
second mortgage,

05:21.190 --> 05:22.539
we wouldn't be eligible.

05:22.670 --> 05:26.413
I'll tell you what,
you don't worry about that.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.718
Let me figure it out.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.199
I gotta make some calls
about the damage, anyway.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.070
I'll call the bank
and see about a loan.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.986
But you're going to London,
no matter what I have

05:35.117 --> 05:37.075
to do to get you there.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.599
Okay.

05:38.729 --> 05:39.382
Okay.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.587
A
mother-daughter pageant.

06:10.718 --> 06:11.762
Oh, no.

06:12.502 --> 06:15.244
No, I know it sounds crazy,
but look at the cash prize.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.985
$100,000.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.640
That's enough to
cover my residency,

06:19.770 --> 06:22.382
and there'll be plenty left
over to put into the spa

06:22.512 --> 06:24.166
and pay off the bills from dad.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.256
There's no fee to
enter the pageant.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.127
Yeah, but don't
people train for years

06:29.258 --> 06:30.825
to win these things?

06:30.955 --> 06:32.348
I don't know.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.742
I, I looked it up online,
and there are three segments.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.308
There's the evening
gown portion,

06:37.440 --> 06:40.051
the interview section, and
the talent competition.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.226
Talent?

06:41.357 --> 06:42.880
What, like singing or
dancing?

06:43.011 --> 06:44.099
Sweetie, I have two left feet,

06:44.229 --> 06:45.187
and you've heard me do karaoke.

06:45.317 --> 06:48.233
No, it says
you can do anything;

06:48.364 --> 06:51.541
paint, read your own
poetry, perfect for me,

06:51.672 --> 06:55.197
uh, juggling, cake
decorating, martial arts,

06:55.327 --> 06:56.807
play an instrument.

06:56.938 --> 06:59.114
You play the violin
and are really good.

06:59.244 --> 07:02.509
Sweetie, that was
a long time ago.

07:02.639 --> 07:05.381
But, the worst thing that
can happen is we lose.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.558
Yeah, I don't know, honey.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.129
The first step is
to apply online,

07:14.259 --> 07:16.610
and I think we
should give it a try.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.092
Please.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.400
Don't ever say I don't love you.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.454
"Why do you wanna
enter the pageant?"

07:35.933 --> 07:36.760
Hmm.

07:39.807 --> 07:43.985
I've never done
a pageant before,

07:44.115 --> 07:48.642
but it's a great way to...

07:49.773 --> 07:51.166
Stretch outside
your comfort zone

07:53.647 --> 07:58.173
and encourage other
people to be brave,

07:59.696 --> 08:00.828
and do the same.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.358
You're looking so
much better, honey.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.317
I knew getting you
that chemical peel

08:12.448 --> 08:15.495
and those fractional lasers on
your face would do the trick.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.280
Thank you, Mom, for reminding
me that my skin is a mess.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.543
Honey, I just want you
to look as beautiful

08:20.674 --> 08:22.763
on the outside as you
are on the inside,

08:22.893 --> 08:26.027
especially with our big
night coming up.

08:26.157 --> 08:27.898
It's our first
mother-daughter pageant.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.683
Oh, isn't this so exciting?

08:29.813 --> 08:31.641
Yeah, I mean, it's
gonna be really fun.

08:33.469 --> 08:34.296
Fun?

08:34.426 --> 08:36.558
Honey, this is a competition.

08:36.690 --> 08:37.778
You are well aware
of how serious it is.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.256
Mm, I know, I know.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.302
I've done this before.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.746
Did your father make plans
with you for his birthday yet?

08:49.877 --> 08:51.269
Um, he's still working
on his work schedule,

08:51.400 --> 08:53.271
but he is going to.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.446
Or he's waiting to
see what his flavor

08:54.577 --> 08:55.404
of the week wants to do.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.188
Mom, stop.

08:58.363 --> 08:59.582
If your own father
doesn't wanna make plans

08:59.713 --> 09:01.279
with his daughter,
that's his loss.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.498
He does. He texted-

09:02.629 --> 09:04.587
Come on, let's go for a jog.

09:04.718 --> 09:05.849
I'll race you.

09:06.676 --> 09:07.329
We both have to get in shape
if we wanna win this pageant.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.031
It's the pageant.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.207
Oh my God, answer it.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.254
Hello?

09:19.863 --> 09:22.736
Emilia, hi, this is Faye from
Atlanta Regional Pageants.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.999
I'm calling to let you
know that after hundreds

09:25.129 --> 09:28.350
of applications, you are one
of 10 mother-daughter teams

09:28.480 --> 09:30.352
to make it to the
next round shoot.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.440
We are?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.355
I mean, um, thank
you so much, Faye.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.183
We're so excited.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.793
You're welcome.

09:36.924 --> 09:39.753
Now, we have a meet
and greet next week.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.668
I'll send you all
the details by email.

09:41.798 --> 09:42.669
That sounds great.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.105
Thank you, again, Faye.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.715
You're so welcome.

09:45.846 --> 09:46.934
We'll see you next week.

09:47.064 --> 09:47.935
Bye.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.547
Ooh, yes!

09:51.678 --> 09:54.376
Oh my God, we did it, we did it!

09:54.506 --> 09:56.987
Yes! Oh my God, I told you.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.032
Oh, you did?

09:58.162 --> 10:00.034
-Oh, yes.
-Wow!

10:00.164 --> 10:01.209
Are you ready for this?

10:01.339 --> 10:03.080
Are you ready?

10:03.211 --> 10:03.951
What have you gotten me into?

10:04.081 --> 10:04.952
Yes!

10:05.953 --> 10:06.649
Aah!

10:21.446 --> 10:22.970
Everyone looks so elegant.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.975
I mean, the email didn't
mention a dress code.

10:29.541 --> 10:30.934
Okay, come on.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.334
Look at Patrice,
she looks so basic.

10:39.464 --> 10:40.378
Hm.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.511
And so red.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.034
Mm.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.863
Rumor is she and
Vivienne, early favorites.

10:46.994 --> 10:47.995
Really?

10:48.125 --> 10:48.996
Hm.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.954
Hm.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.956
Do you know what? One second.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.350
-Hi.
-Oh God, here she comes.

10:56.394 --> 10:57.787
Help.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.528
Adeline. Darcy.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.095
Oh.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.400
Mwah.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.968
A mother-daughter pageant,
so exciting, right?

11:05.099 --> 11:06.230
It really is.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.885
Well, this must be like
a normal day for you.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.800
I hear you've been
competing quite a bit lately

11:10.931 --> 11:12.541
on the Mrs. pageant circuit.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.629
Very cute.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.936
I dabble
here and there.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.459
Won a crown or two.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.504
But over the last
year, I focused

11:19.635 --> 11:20.941
mainly on my charity work.

11:21.071 --> 11:21.811
I saw.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.595
You were named Woman of the Year

11:23.726 --> 11:25.423
for the Atlanta
Heart Foundation.

11:25.554 --> 11:26.729
Congratulations.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.122
Thank you.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.993
I'm really proud of the
work I've done with them.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.387
Mm-hmm.

11:33.823 --> 11:37.174
Um, well, good
luck today, ladies.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.394
You too.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.398
She's not gonna be
their favorite for long.

11:44.616 --> 11:45.400
What was that?

11:46.531 --> 11:47.402
Who are those two?

11:48.925 --> 11:50.579
I don't know.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.276
Go find out. Go.

11:57.455 --> 11:58.761
Hi, you must be new.

11:58.892 --> 11:59.893
I'm Darcy.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.503
Oh, I'm Emilia,
and this is Sophie.

12:01.633 --> 12:02.722
-Hey.
-Nice to meet you.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.245
I haven't seen you around.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.421
Pageants are such a small world.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.423
Actually, it's our
first time entering.

12:09.337 --> 12:10.686
You mean, ever?

12:10.817 --> 12:12.296
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.471
Oh my.

12:13.602 --> 12:16.170
And you were chosen
as one of the 10.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.301
That's...

12:18.650 --> 12:22.480
Well, what talent do
you plan on performing?

12:22.611 --> 12:25.309
Oh, I write poetry, so I
think I'll do a reading.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.790
Oh, how sweet.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.358
And my mom is really
good at the violin.

12:30.488 --> 12:31.707
Oh, she's talking me up.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.275
The truth is, I haven't
played in quite some time.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.538
Hm.

12:41.108 --> 12:44.633
Crystal, my new pageant
coach, has led several

12:44.764 --> 12:46.548
of her clients to nationals.

12:46.678 --> 12:50.421
I'm telling you, working with
her has been game-changing.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.075
Never heard of her.

12:52.206 --> 12:55.078
Adeline, it's so
good to see you.

12:55.209 --> 12:56.384
You as well. How are things?

12:56.514 --> 12:59.779
Great. I just celebrated my
25th wedding anniversary.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.520
Still feels like we're in
the honeymoon stage though.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.000
Congratulations.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.436
Thank you.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.568
Is your mom here?

13:07.264 --> 13:09.005
Oh no, she's at another
important engagement today.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.354
Mm.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.661
She must be thrilled you
made the cut this time?

13:13.880 --> 13:15.533
Of course, but she'll
be even happier

13:15.664 --> 13:19.102
when Lilliana and
I win.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.452
Good luck with that.

13:21.583 --> 13:22.366
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

13:22.497 --> 13:23.237
Mm-hm.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.851
-I think I'll win.
-Hi, ladies.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.200
-Hi.
-Hey, Mom.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.594
-Having fun?
-Yeah, great time, mm-hmm.

13:34.552 --> 13:37.033
Ugh, oh my God, doing a
pageant with our mothers

13:37.164 --> 13:38.208
is so weird.

13:38.339 --> 13:39.862
-It's so weird.
-Who decided to make it

13:39.993 --> 13:41.124
a mother-daughter
pageant anyway?

13:41.255 --> 13:42.560
They've never done this before.

13:42.691 --> 13:43.735
Ugh, I have no idea.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.563
Well, as long as your
mom keeps winning

13:45.694 --> 13:47.391
the old people
pageants, we'll be okay.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.394
Well, what about you, Lilliana?

13:50.525 --> 13:52.788
Your mom is, like, really
intense about this stuff.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.530
Yeah, that's an understatement.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.666
The tag on this
dress is so itchy.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.886
-Do you have scissors?
-No.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.496
What did you find out
about the newbies?

14:05.627 --> 14:07.585
Oh. The mother's name is Emilia.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.326
She's opening a spa.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.240
Now, Sophie is the daughter.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.895
She's into literature
and poetry.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.766
Emilia said she used
to play the violin,

14:14.897 --> 14:16.377
but now she's rusty.

14:18.509 --> 14:19.641
That's it?

14:19.771 --> 14:21.948
Well, I tried to find
out about a husband,

14:22.078 --> 14:23.340
but she didn't say much.

14:23.471 --> 14:26.561
Get the feeling that there
is not one in the picture.

14:26.691 --> 14:27.997
Oh, great.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.304
That means she'll use a
single mother sob story

14:30.434 --> 14:32.480
to endear the judges.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.656
Well, you're single now.

14:35.831 --> 14:38.094
That's entirely different.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.923
Well, they don't seem
like much of a threat.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.577
Are you kidding?

14:42.707 --> 14:45.841
Do you remember the Teen Beauty
Atlanta pageant 3 years ago?

14:45.972 --> 14:49.279
That girl, Kenzie, the one
with the terribly shrill voice,

14:49.410 --> 14:52.195
she took the title
over Lilliana.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.718
That was Kenzie's first pageant.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.677
No, everybody here is a threat.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.375
But I got a bigger problem.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.725
Patrice.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.685
She's wandering around here
like she's already won.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.470
Maybe she's just confident.

15:06.601 --> 15:07.297
Exactly.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.995
I'm not taking any chances.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.084
Not for this pageant.

15:11.214 --> 15:13.913
You know my family
legacy's at risk.

15:14.043 --> 15:17.481
So, Patrice will be
disqualified when they find out

15:17.612 --> 15:19.875
that her precious
daughter's on drugs.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.878
Slip this into Vivienne's
purse when she's not looking.

15:24.706 --> 15:27.100
Adeline, I can't do that.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.189
I mean, really.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.321
Well, then I guess I
need to break my silence

15:31.452 --> 15:32.801
on your little indiscretion.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.848
Adeline, please.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.938
Poor Mackenzie, she's
just out there bragging

15:39.068 --> 15:40.678
about her wedding anniversary.

15:41.853 --> 15:42.680
I guess she won't
think they're still

15:42.811 --> 15:44.726
in the honeymoon
phase any longer,

15:44.856 --> 15:47.903
when she finds out you've
been screwing her husband.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.645
How will your family
feel when they find out?

15:51.951 --> 15:55.780
I will not plant drugs
on a teenage girl.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.696
That's your choice.

16:01.656 --> 16:02.787
Fine.

16:05.268 --> 16:06.704
How will anyone even
know that Vivienne

16:06.835 --> 16:08.228
has drugs in her bag?

16:11.361 --> 16:14.538
Don't worry about it,
just follow my lead.

16:14.669 --> 16:15.800
Unbelievable.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.682
Emilia.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.379
Hi, Darcy.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.251
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.601
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:33.731 --> 16:34.732
You're Emilia, right?

16:34.863 --> 16:35.646
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm Adeline.

16:35.777 --> 16:36.734
Nice to meet you.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.519
Darcy says that you're
new to pageants.

16:38.649 --> 16:39.781
Yes.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.652
Well, you must be so
nervous your first time?

16:41.783 --> 16:43.654
Oh, I'm certainly a
fish out of water here.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.006
It's nice to see a new face.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.268
I look forward to getting
to know you better.

16:48.398 --> 16:49.747
-Same.
-This tag.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.880
Oh, here, let me
help you with that.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.882
I have got a sewing
kit in my purse,

16:54.013 --> 16:55.579
and I think it's
got some scissors.

16:55.710 --> 16:56.972
-Oh.
-Here we go.

16:58.234 --> 16:58.843
-Ah.
-There we go.

16:58.974 --> 16:59.714
Oh.

17:00.845 --> 17:01.585
Thank you.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.587
No problem.

17:03.718 --> 17:06.112
Well, it was nice
talking to you both.

17:06.242 --> 17:06.982
Bye-bye.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.291
What is she wearing?

17:12.422 --> 17:13.684
My gosh.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.296
I can't, it's just too hideous.

17:21.823 --> 17:22.563
Hm.

17:25.608 --> 17:28.351
Wow, I have
never seen anyone eat carbs

17:28.482 --> 17:30.266
at one of these things.

17:30.397 --> 17:31.267
Really?

17:31.398 --> 17:32.616
Really.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.054
Welcome to the pageant,
where most of these girls

17:35.184 --> 17:37.578
just exist off of baby
food and laxatives.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.016
That sounds very unhealthy.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.497
Yeah, no kidding.

17:43.627 --> 17:44.672
I'm Mia, by the way.

17:44.802 --> 17:47.283
I saw you talking to
my mom, Darcy, earlier.

17:47.414 --> 17:48.676
I'm Sophie.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.025
Nice to meet you.

17:50.156 --> 17:53.115
You too.

17:53.246 --> 17:56.684
Okay, so that's me,
obviously.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.990
That's Tatum.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.862
That's Lilliana Bordeaux.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.820
She won the pageant last year.

18:02.951 --> 18:06.476
Her grandmother, Rebecca,
she's basically royalty.

18:06.607 --> 18:09.044
She's super connected
and convinces a bunch

18:09.175 --> 18:11.786
of rich people to donate money
to the pageant every year.

18:13.135 --> 18:16.095
Everyone is so beautiful.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.880
Seriously, it's, it's
pretty intimidating.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.623
Oh my gosh, stop. You
are gorgeous too, okay?

18:23.363 --> 18:24.668
And you know what?

18:24.799 --> 18:26.235
Look, if you want some
help practicing your walk,

18:26.366 --> 18:28.150
or you just want some pointers,

18:28.281 --> 18:29.804
we should exchange numbers.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.022
Really?

18:31.153 --> 18:32.023
That's so cool of you.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.590
Sure, gimme your phone.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.380
Who's that?

18:42.512 --> 18:43.426
That's Harper.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.908
She, um, she died.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.998
Oh my God, what, what happened?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.043
A few weeks before
the last pageant,

18:52.174 --> 18:55.046
she was attacked in the
parking lot of her gym.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.092
That's terrible.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.833
Cops said it was
a random robbery.

19:00.356 --> 19:03.142
Honey, they're ready for
us to do our interview.

19:03.272 --> 19:04.055
All right, I'll be right there.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.753
Okay.

19:05.883 --> 19:06.580
Thanks.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.809
It's really nice they're doing
a mother-daughter pageant

19:18.940 --> 19:19.680
this year, don't you think?

19:19.810 --> 19:21.290
Absolutely.

19:21.421 --> 19:24.902
That's why I really, I hope
what I'm hearing is not true.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.252
What have you heard?

19:26.382 --> 19:27.688
But, you don't know?

19:27.818 --> 19:29.124
No. Tell me.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.302
Apparently, one of
the girls in this room

19:33.433 --> 19:35.391
has a serious drug problem.

19:35.522 --> 19:36.349
Who?

19:41.005 --> 19:41.702
Really?

19:44.661 --> 19:47.490
Well, you'll have to excuse
me, I completely forgot I need

19:47.621 --> 19:49.188
to bring Roberta
some hand cream.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.124
Mom, what are you doing?

20:13.255 --> 20:14.213
Nothing.

20:16.345 --> 20:17.912
Okay. Well, they're
about to interview us.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.522
Oh. Okay.

20:19.653 --> 20:20.306
I'll be right there.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.220
Okay.

20:35.669 --> 20:38.106
Ladies, ladies, gather around.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.108
It's wonderful to see you
all here looking so lovely.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.198
Pageants are about legacy.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.634
That's why we decided to host

20:44.765 --> 20:47.115
a mother-daughter
pageant this season.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.770
Our winners bring a wholesome
power to the community.

20:49.900 --> 20:50.988
They are role models.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.774
The current and future
leaders of our hometowns,

20:53.904 --> 20:55.732
our state, and our world.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.256
Ladies, I hope you'll take pride

20:57.386 --> 20:59.606
in this awesome responsibility.

20:59.736 --> 21:00.955
-Oh God! Oh my gosh!
-Oh!

21:02.478 --> 21:04.350
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.655
So embarrassing.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.875
Here, let me help you
pick these things up.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.093
Thank you.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.096
Goodness, such a klutz.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.620
Did you see that?

21:15.665 --> 21:17.493
What is this?

21:17.624 --> 21:18.407
Hm?

21:19.930 --> 21:21.105
Is that drugs?

21:23.151 --> 21:25.066
Oh my God, it's true.

21:25.196 --> 21:27.590
-Oh my gosh.
-Whose purse is that?

21:28.156 --> 21:30.027
I think it's Vivienne's.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.942
That's not mine.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.292
I've never seen that before.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.859
That's not mine, I swear.

21:35.990 --> 21:36.860
What did you do?

21:36.991 --> 21:38.514
-Nothing, Mom.
-That is your purse.

21:38.645 --> 21:41.125
Somebody must
have put that there.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.998
Faye, it's not hers.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.826
This must be some
kind of mistake.

21:47.349 --> 21:50.787
I'm sorry, but you two are
officially disqualified.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.789
Our contestants are
supposed to be role models

21:52.920 --> 21:54.051
to this community.

21:54.182 --> 21:55.662
Mom, this is not fair.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.054
Those drugs are not even mine.

21:57.185 --> 21:58.012
That is enough.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.755
-Faye.
-Patrice, I can't.

22:05.672 --> 22:08.196
I know. I can't believe
that about Vivienne.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.676
I've been doing pageants
with her forever.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.027
Well, call me later, okay?

22:13.157 --> 22:13.941
Okay, I will.

22:14.071 --> 22:15.246
Sweet.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.639
Oh, hey, Darcy, since
the girls are planning

22:16.770 --> 22:18.728
to get together, maybe we
can get together sometime?

22:18.859 --> 22:20.469
Grab lunch or...

22:20.600 --> 22:22.253
Oh, s-

22:25.474 --> 22:28.259
I'm not sure I can,
I'm really busy.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.522
Just a lot going on.

22:30.479 --> 22:31.350
Oh.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.482
Okay. Well, if you
change your mind.

22:33.613 --> 22:34.875
Yeah, sure.

22:35.919 --> 22:36.659
Let's go, Mia.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.053
-Bye.
-Bye.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.755
You're helping the
competition now?

22:46.452 --> 22:48.236
What? I can't make friends?

22:49.455 --> 22:50.891
You're always hanging
out with Adeline.

22:52.501 --> 22:53.546
Get in the car, Mia.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.071
Whatever, Mom.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.383
Okay, nice and tall,
long neck, and go.

23:05.558 --> 23:06.123
Good.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.473
Engage your core.

23:07.603 --> 23:09.344
Don't suck in your stomach
and stick out your ribs,

23:09.475 --> 23:10.737
you look like a linebacker.

23:12.086 --> 23:13.217
Graceful. Honey,
you're clomping.

23:13.348 --> 23:14.523
Mom, I know how to walk.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.525
I won last year, remember?

23:16.656 --> 23:18.179
Yeah, thanks to me.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.182
What is that supposed to mean?

23:21.312 --> 23:24.838
I just mean that I
coached you to win.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.013
Honey, I know I
can be hard on you,

23:26.143 --> 23:29.277
but that's just because
I see your potential.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.019
And we deserve something
good, don't we?

23:32.149 --> 23:34.108
After your father left
us for that trashy-

23:34.238 --> 23:36.110
Mom, stop.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.807
Dad didn't leave us for anyone.

23:37.938 --> 23:40.070
He left because you
treated him like garbage.

23:41.202 --> 23:43.030
You don't call or knock?

23:43.160 --> 23:45.249
No, I own this house, I can
come and go as I please.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.469
Ah, my beautiful granddaughter.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.341
Aah, you are a
winner.

23:50.472 --> 23:51.342
Can you tell that to Mom?

23:51.473 --> 23:53.432
She thinks I need
to work on my walk.

23:53.562 --> 23:56.347
You're the one who
needs to practice.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.567
You take a break, sweetie,
you're perfection.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.178
Hello, Kendra.

24:01.309 --> 24:02.353
Hi, Mrs. Bordeaux.

24:02.484 --> 24:03.267
Good to see you.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.055
You don't need to insult me
in front of my own daughter.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.144
You haven't competed
in over 18 years,

24:10.274 --> 24:12.755
and there's some
stiff competition.

24:12.886 --> 24:15.541
Now, with Patrice and
Vivienne out of the pageant,

24:15.671 --> 24:16.977
there are nine
mother-daughter teams left,

24:17.107 --> 24:18.761
including you and Lilliana.

24:18.892 --> 24:21.634
I'd keep my eye on these two.

24:21.764 --> 24:22.852
The judges watched
the interviews

24:22.983 --> 24:26.421
and seemed quite interested
in our newcomers.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.162
Not afraid of a
little competition.

24:30.338 --> 24:33.080
I watched for years as you lost

24:33.210 --> 24:35.517
every single pageant
I put you in.

24:35.648 --> 24:38.825
That's because you
were afraid and weak.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.654
I'm not sure that's
changed at all.

24:55.798 --> 24:58.061
Okay, here we go.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.802
Shoulders back.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.239
Yep. Head, a little higher.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.764
Higher.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.548
I know it feels unnatural,
but the judges love it.

25:06.679 --> 25:07.244
Yeah.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.376
Okay, here we go.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.769
Mm-hmm.

25:09.899 --> 25:10.683
Good.

25:12.032 --> 25:14.382
Look, thank you so
much for helping me,

25:14.513 --> 25:16.210
especially since
you're competition.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.866
I'm not exactly trying to win.

25:22.912 --> 25:23.739
Why is that?

25:25.175 --> 25:26.525
You have to promise
not to tell anybody.

25:28.352 --> 25:29.092
I won't.

25:32.182 --> 25:33.880
I caught my mom
cheating on my dad.

25:35.708 --> 25:36.535
Oh my God.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.450
Yeah.

25:39.581 --> 25:42.410
And I can't tell my dad,
even though I want to,

25:43.411 --> 25:45.239
but it would break
him, you know?

25:47.241 --> 25:49.896
So, I'm going to get back at
my mom in a different way.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.378
How?

25:56.250 --> 25:57.338
If there's anything my mom loves

25:57.468 --> 25:59.427
in this world, it's pageants.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.995
When she found out this one
was for mothers and daughters,

26:02.125 --> 26:04.519
I'd literally never
seen her so happy.

26:04.650 --> 26:08.697
But after what she did to my
dad, I just can't help her win.

26:08.828 --> 26:11.178
Oh, you're going to
throw the competition?

26:11.308 --> 26:13.093
Mm-hmm.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.791
But I'm gonna wait
till the next cut.

26:15.922 --> 26:19.316
Let us get to the final five,
where she can almost touch

26:19.447 --> 26:23.277
the crown, and then
make it all go away.

26:26.715 --> 26:29.892
Wow, that probably
sounds really crazy, right?

26:30.023 --> 26:31.894
Hey, I don't judge

26:35.071 --> 26:36.420
And that's why I like you.

26:36.551 --> 26:37.857
And why I want you to win.

26:39.249 --> 26:41.295
Okay, so what are you
wearing to the next event?

26:42.252 --> 26:43.036
I don't know.

26:43.166 --> 26:43.950
Uh...

26:45.299 --> 26:49.608
This is probably the
dressiest thing I own.

26:49.738 --> 26:53.089
No, no, you can't
wear that.

26:53.220 --> 26:56.571
Um, there is a local boutique
that sponsors the pageant.

26:56.702 --> 26:57.964
They send over a
bunch of dresses

26:58.094 --> 26:59.356
to the contestants every year,

26:59.487 --> 27:00.488
so you should call Faye.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.881
She'll let you know when you

27:02.011 --> 27:03.622
can drop by pageant
headquarters and try some on.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.102
Cool, thanks.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.582
You're welcome.

27:07.713 --> 27:08.409
Yeah, probably a good call.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.367
Yeah, don't, don't wear that.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.505
Hm.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.986
Mm.

27:20.116 --> 27:23.903
Ah, you look so pretty, Mom.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.339
Oh, thanks, honey.

27:26.775 --> 27:30.692
Mm, I don't like the
way the dress fits me.

27:30.823 --> 27:31.519
No?

27:31.650 --> 27:32.825
No.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.348
I think I'm gonna just
try a different one on.

27:34.478 --> 27:35.654
Okay.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.965
What's wrong?

27:43.096 --> 27:45.664
The deposit is overdue for
the literature residency.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.404
I already asked
for an extension,

27:47.535 --> 27:49.493
but since they have a wait-list,

27:49.624 --> 27:51.234
they don't wanna be flexible.

27:51.365 --> 27:52.801
I'll give them a call and
see if there's something

27:52.932 --> 27:55.238
we can work out, okay?

27:55.369 --> 27:56.805
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.468
Oh, Emilia.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.165
I'm sorry, Faye
gave me this time.

28:09.296 --> 28:11.254
She didn't mention anybody
else was back here.

28:11.385 --> 28:12.429
Oh, we're just wrapping up.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.040
Oh.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.740
Hmm, that dress
looks amazing on you.

28:18.871 --> 28:19.610
Thank you.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.569
Looks a little loose though.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.876
Hmm? Feels okay.

28:24.006 --> 28:26.356
Yeah, ideally, you wanted
to accentuate your curves.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.489
Here, let me show you.

28:32.449 --> 28:33.929
Oh yeah, you could take
this in about an inch.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.453
-Ouch!
-Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

28:36.584 --> 28:37.803
You okay, Mom?

28:37.933 --> 28:40.196
I was just making some
tailoring suggestions.

28:40.327 --> 28:41.850
-Ugh.
-See?

28:41.981 --> 28:43.417
But you don't look so wide.

28:45.636 --> 28:46.812
-Hm.
-Yeah.

28:46.942 --> 28:48.901
It's good, right?

28:51.599 --> 28:53.079
But I don't understand.

28:54.384 --> 28:55.559
Hey, Mom, do you think
these earrings would go

28:55.690 --> 28:57.213
with the dress I got.

28:57.344 --> 28:58.301
Section
two, paragraph five.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.695
Is there any way I can
appeal the decision?

29:00.826 --> 29:01.391
Yes, you can reach out

29:01.522 --> 29:02.305
to Mr. Ginley personally.

29:02.436 --> 29:04.090
Okay.

29:04.220 --> 29:05.613
Sure, I'll try
giving him a call.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.053
What's wrong?

29:11.184 --> 29:13.055
I just found out that
insurance may not cover

29:13.186 --> 29:14.753
the damages at the spa.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.189
I can try to appeal
the decision,

29:16.319 --> 29:19.279
but that'll take time and
delay the opening even longer.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.673
Or we could win the pageant

29:22.804 --> 29:25.502
and you'll have all
the money you'll need.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.287
I love your optimism, honey.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.464
Are these worthy of a crown?

29:30.594 --> 29:32.466
Hm? Yes.

29:32.596 --> 29:33.859
No.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.730
Okay, maybe I'll go back
to the drawing board.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.559
You are worthy of the crown.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.082
-Come here.
-Aw.

29:40.213 --> 29:40.953
I love you.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.042
Now put 'em on.

29:43.172 --> 29:43.738
Okay.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.482
♪ Ah ha

29:48.612 --> 29:51.572
♪ All right

29:51.702 --> 29:54.401
♪ I don't feel anything

29:54.531 --> 29:56.316
♪ Oh yeah

29:56.446 --> 29:58.927
♪ Tonight

29:59.058 --> 30:01.103
Hey, Sophie and Emilia.

30:01.234 --> 30:03.192
Come on, you two, let me show
you where to put your stuff.

30:03.323 --> 30:04.150
Thanks.

30:06.065 --> 30:08.328
We've got a big day ahead,
so I hope you're ready.

30:10.765 --> 30:12.854
You can hang your
dresses up here.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.116
-Mm-hmm.
-Things down over here.

30:14.247 --> 30:15.901
Changing room's upstairs.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.164
Come on, I want you to
meet Rebecca Bordeaux.

30:19.382 --> 30:20.514
-Okay.
-Okay.

31:28.321 --> 31:28.756
Hey.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.412
Hey, here you are.
Where have you been?

31:32.542 --> 31:33.761
I've been looking
all over for you.

31:34.762 --> 31:36.242
I had something to take care of.

31:36.372 --> 31:39.593
Ladies! Ladies!

31:39.723 --> 31:42.988
Everyone, we have a very
special guest joining us today.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.467
Rebecca Bordeaux!

31:51.605 --> 31:53.650
Rebecca is one of our
biggest supporters,

31:53.781 --> 31:56.436
and we are thrilled
to have her with us.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.525
She generously connected
us to the owners

31:58.655 --> 32:00.570
of this beautiful
space who lent it to us

32:00.701 --> 32:02.311
for the pageant this year.

32:02.442 --> 32:07.316
And she secured all donors
for the $100,000 prize.

32:09.492 --> 32:11.233
Oh.

32:11.364 --> 32:12.713
Hello and welcome, everyone,

32:12.843 --> 32:17.109
to this first ever regional
Atlanta mother-daughter pageant.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.025
I want you all to
know that everyone

32:20.155 --> 32:21.896
is given a fair
opportunity to win.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.725
I have no say in the
outcome of this pageant.

32:24.855 --> 32:28.163
Now, some of you are more
seasoned with many titles,

32:28.294 --> 32:31.166
and others are here
for their first try.

32:31.297 --> 32:35.301
And others have competed many
times and haven't won yet.

32:36.867 --> 32:40.436
The strongest contestants,
the ones who get the crown,

32:40.567 --> 32:43.874
focus on their own strengths.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.225
I wish you all the
very best of luck.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.183
Hm, I love you all.

33:03.329 --> 33:06.158
Oh my God, it's ruined.

33:07.724 --> 33:09.204
Who would do this?

33:11.511 --> 33:14.079
It looks like somebody took a
pair of scissors to my gown.

33:14.209 --> 33:15.906
-That's really terrible.
-Oh my gosh.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.866
-It wasn't me.
-No one's gonna fess up?

33:26.526 --> 33:28.093
Emilia had a pair of
scissors in her purse.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.007
What?

33:29.137 --> 33:30.660
I, I absolutely did not do that.

33:30.791 --> 33:32.314
How dare you accuse me?

33:32.445 --> 33:34.708
Who do you think you are?

33:34.838 --> 33:36.753
What is all the
commotion back here?

33:36.884 --> 33:38.190
My dress.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.627
Somebody in this
room destroyed it.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.759
Well, before we start throwing
accusations, let's think-

33:42.890 --> 33:45.371
Faye, let me talk
with my daughter.

33:45.501 --> 33:46.198
Adeline.

33:47.634 --> 33:48.765
-What?
-Come here.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.550
What?

33:50.680 --> 33:52.813
Faye, I am not
responsible for this.

33:52.943 --> 33:54.554
Don't worry, we'll
figure this out.

34:00.516 --> 34:03.258
Mother! What the
hell are you doing?

34:03.389 --> 34:05.304
I could ask you
the same question.

34:05.434 --> 34:06.957
I know what you're
up to, Adeline.

34:07.088 --> 34:09.047
You're trying to chip
off your competition.

34:09.177 --> 34:11.397
That Emilia woman, she
just shredded my gown.

34:11.527 --> 34:12.398
You are accusing me?

34:12.527 --> 34:13.399
I take it you didn't
know that there

34:13.529 --> 34:15.226
were security
cameras back there.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.621
There's no cameras
in the dressing room.

34:18.752 --> 34:22.234
Of course not, but there
are in the makeup area,

34:22.364 --> 34:23.757
where the dresses are hanging.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.065
You're lucky I am
the one who secured

34:27.195 --> 34:28.239
this space for the pageant.

34:29.502 --> 34:31.373
Now, do I need to
go to the office

34:31.504 --> 34:35.116
and rewind the footage to
see what really happened?

34:35.246 --> 34:36.944
Or would you rather
I just erase it?

34:40.252 --> 34:40.904
Hm?

34:41.034 --> 34:42.819
That's what I thought.

34:42.949 --> 34:44.516
I have a reputation to protect,

34:44.647 --> 34:47.085
and that's the only reason I'm
getting you out of this mess.

34:47.215 --> 34:48.824
You will not put shame
on this family legacy,

34:48.956 --> 34:49.783
do you hear me?

34:51.263 --> 34:53.178
Now, you're gonna
go back in there

34:53.308 --> 34:55.527
and tell everyone
you made a mistake.

34:55.658 --> 34:58.748
Tell them, tell them you
fired your housekeeper

34:58.879 --> 35:00.620
this morning and
before you left,

35:00.750 --> 35:02.317
she retaliated by
shredding your gown.

35:02.448 --> 35:03.449
No.

35:03.579 --> 35:05.712
No, Mother, no.
Nobody's gonna buy that.

35:05.842 --> 35:08.149
Th- there's a piece of my dress
stuck on Emilia's scissors.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.108
This is not up for debate.

35:11.805 --> 35:13.023
-Go.
-Oh my God.

35:16.505 --> 35:19.291
Ladies, I apologize.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.597
I made the wrong assumption.

35:21.728 --> 35:26.036
Unfortunately, I had to let my
housekeeper go earlier today

35:26.167 --> 35:30.432
and I had no idea she
would be this vindictive.

35:30.563 --> 35:32.739
I'm just glad you figured
out what happened.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.436
Do you have somethin'
else to wear?

35:34.567 --> 35:36.656
Rosewood Boutique is gonna
rush me over a new gown.

35:36.786 --> 35:37.613
Perfect.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.615
Now that we have
that cleared up,

35:39.746 --> 35:41.095
the judges are on their way in.

35:41.226 --> 35:44.446
Please, everyone, get ready
and meet me in the main room.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.622
We start in half an hour.

35:46.753 --> 35:48.711
Mom, there is no way Kendra
would destroy your dress.

35:48.842 --> 35:51.279
Lilliana, I don't need
your input right now.

36:01.985 --> 36:04.249
You're gonna do fine, honey.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.599
If anyone should be
nervous, it's me.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.862
I haven't done this
piece in almost 10 years.

36:09.950 --> 36:11.952
You're gonna do great.

36:12.082 --> 36:13.171
Thank you, honey.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.827
Everyone, please gather around.

36:21.004 --> 36:23.616
I am pleased to
introduce our judges.

36:23.746 --> 36:26.619
Let's give a warm round of
applause for Cyrus Price.

36:28.621 --> 36:29.752
Franklin Davis.

36:32.886 --> 36:34.409
And Vanessa Handler.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.196
Thank you.

36:40.676 --> 36:43.288
The judges have watched
your interview tape.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.028
Today they are going
to watch you perform

36:45.159 --> 36:47.640
for the preliminary competition.

36:47.770 --> 36:50.991
After, they're going to decide
on the final five pairs.

36:51.121 --> 36:53.167
Lilliana, you're up first.

37:42.303 --> 37:43.565

Sophie, it's your turn.

39:41.770 --> 39:42.728
You're gonna do great.

39:46.558 --> 39:49.082
Uh?

39:50.649 --> 39:51.345
What's wrong, honey?

39:51.476 --> 39:54.392
My poem, it, it, was right here.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.394
It's gotta be down
here somewhere.

39:57.612 --> 39:58.613
It's gone.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.093
I...

40:00.223 --> 40:02.791
Hey, hey, hey, look,
you've got this.

40:02.922 --> 40:04.663
You've got this many times.

40:04.793 --> 40:05.925
You wrote it.

40:06.055 --> 40:07.622
Deep breath.

40:07.753 --> 40:08.406
Go get 'em.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.943
This is a poem I
wrote for my father.

40:26.641 --> 40:31.298
"Lightly they pass,
lifting the mist.

40:32.386 --> 40:34.040
Burying a golden leaf.

40:37.652 --> 40:39.132
Color no longer green."

40:41.917 --> 40:45.530
Um...

40:45.660 --> 40:50.709
The...

40:50.839 --> 40:52.014
Um...

40:52.145 --> 40:56.018
I'm sorry, I, um, I
had a copy of my poem,

40:56.149 --> 40:57.106
but I must have misplaced it.

40:57.237 --> 40:59.326
It's okay, you're fine.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.154
If you qualify for
the next round,

41:01.284 --> 41:04.026
just bring an extra copy with
you at the pageant final.

41:04.157 --> 41:04.984
It's gonna be okay.

41:07.900 --> 41:08.901
It's okay.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.039
I think I just
ruined our chances.

41:17.170 --> 41:19.259
No, you did not.

41:19.389 --> 41:20.478
You're okay.

41:20.608 --> 41:21.653
I just need some air.

41:43.588 --> 41:44.893
Sophie.

41:45.024 --> 41:46.939
Seriously, do not sweat that.

41:47.069 --> 41:48.897
I just blew it in there.

41:49.028 --> 41:51.204
Look, don't
worry about it, okay?

41:51.334 --> 41:53.032
They're picking the
final five today.

41:53.162 --> 41:55.861
Sophie, anything can
happen. Trust me.

41:57.384 --> 41:59.212
Are you going to the pageant
sleepover tomorrow night?

42:00.126 --> 42:01.910
I didn't even know about it.

42:02.041 --> 42:04.696
Tatum. She always tries to
leave the new girls out.

42:04.826 --> 42:06.959
It's at her house, her
parents are really rich.

42:07.089 --> 42:08.351
It's actually kinda fun.

42:09.701 --> 42:12.660
Okay, yeah, I'll go,
unless I get cut today.

42:12.791 --> 42:15.184
Sophie, it's not just
for the final five.

42:15.315 --> 42:16.925
Come on, they're about
to announce the winners.

42:17.056 --> 42:17.970
Okay.

42:20.668 --> 42:25.194
Moving ahead in the competition
are Mackenzie and Tatum.

42:25.325 --> 42:27.936
Ah! Oh my God.

42:28.067 --> 42:29.242
We got this.

42:30.199 --> 42:31.592
Darcy and Mia.

42:33.594 --> 42:35.335
Roberta and Scarlett.

42:38.947 --> 42:40.383
Adeline and Lilliana.

42:41.167 --> 42:42.734
Yes! I told you, honey.

42:44.997 --> 42:48.174
And finally, Emilia and Sophie.

42:48.304 --> 42:49.784
Oh my God.

42:49.915 --> 42:51.525
This is great.

42:51.656 --> 42:52.439
We did it!

42:54.180 --> 42:55.311
-Yeah.
-We did it.

42:55.442 --> 42:56.791
Congratulations.

42:56.922 --> 42:59.098
Let's give a warm
round of applause

42:59.228 --> 43:02.014
to our five
mother-daughter finalists.

43:08.020 --> 43:09.543
What have I been telling you?

43:09.674 --> 43:11.850
Emilia and her daughter
are a real threat.

43:11.980 --> 43:13.895
I hear you, Mother.

43:14.026 --> 43:15.114
You better step things up.

43:22.208 --> 43:26.386
Emilia Connors, you
are one impressive violinist.

43:26.516 --> 43:27.909
Oh, thank you.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.824
You look familiar.

43:29.955 --> 43:33.001
Were you a vendor at the town
Christmas market last year?

43:33.132 --> 43:34.350
Yes, I was.

43:34.481 --> 43:37.397
I bought a basket from
you, a gift for my ma.

43:37.527 --> 43:38.137
Some spa products.

43:38.267 --> 43:40.400
-Mm.
-She loved them.

43:40.530 --> 43:41.619
You know, you should really
think about opening up

43:41.749 --> 43:42.794
a place here in town.

43:42.924 --> 43:44.796
I am opening a spa, actually.

43:44.926 --> 43:46.406
Hopefully, within
the next six weeks.

43:46.536 --> 43:47.494
That's great.

43:48.626 --> 43:49.801
You know, I've
been watching you.

43:51.063 --> 43:52.107
Oh?

43:52.238 --> 43:54.283
Oh, that came out wrong.

43:54.414 --> 43:55.328
I mean, in the pageant.

43:55.458 --> 43:56.546
Mm.

43:56.677 --> 43:59.288
It's just refreshing
to have contestants

43:59.419 --> 44:01.813
who aren't so rehearsed,
you know what I mean?

44:02.857 --> 44:05.381
I think I do, and thank you.

44:10.996 --> 44:12.606
Ugh.

44:12.737 --> 44:14.913
What does Cyrus even
see in Emilia anyway?

44:15.043 --> 44:16.871
She's so plain.

44:17.002 --> 44:20.483
And her violin
skills, hm, not great.

44:20.614 --> 44:23.878
She's opening up a spa,
but have you seen her skin?

44:24.009 --> 44:26.751
She looks 10 years
older than she is.

44:26.881 --> 44:29.144
I have to do something
before the judge's luncheon.

44:29.275 --> 44:33.018
I can't risk them spending
any more time together.

44:33.148 --> 44:35.455
I need to solve this
problem on my own.

44:35.585 --> 44:37.022
What do you mean?

44:37.152 --> 44:38.980
I have to get Cyrus
to vote for me.

44:39.111 --> 44:39.851
How?

44:41.113 --> 44:43.071
I have my ways.

44:43.202 --> 44:46.684
You're not gonna do anything
to Emilia or Sophie.

44:46.814 --> 44:47.946
-Adeline, I can't
-Enough.

44:48.076 --> 44:52.080
Darcy, stop your blabbering,
I need your help.

44:52.211 --> 44:54.561
You're still a member of
Seasons Country Club, right?

44:55.388 --> 44:57.390
Y- yes.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.045
The manager is an
old college friend.

45:00.175 --> 45:01.133
I invited you to
check it out, but you-

45:01.263 --> 45:03.613
I didn't care about
that tacky place then,

45:03.744 --> 45:06.094
but I did some research
and I found out

45:06.225 --> 45:09.097
that Cyrus plays pickleball
there with a friend.

45:09.228 --> 45:11.012
And you can get me
in as a guest, right?

45:12.187 --> 45:13.449
Yes.

45:13.580 --> 45:14.494
Good.

45:32.033 --> 45:33.295
Oh!

45:33.426 --> 45:34.253
Mm!

45:34.993 --> 45:36.255
I think I need a break.

45:36.385 --> 45:37.212
Hm.

45:38.431 --> 45:40.128
Oh. Get over here.

45:43.088 --> 45:44.306
Cyrus.

45:44.437 --> 45:46.308
Oh, hello, Adeline.

45:46.439 --> 45:48.528
Well, I didn't know
you were a member here.

45:48.658 --> 45:50.922
Yes, I enjoy it here, um,

45:51.052 --> 45:52.706
it's less stuffy than the
other clubs around the area.

45:52.837 --> 45:53.576
Are you a member?

45:53.707 --> 45:54.621
Oh, I'm thinking about joining.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.188
-Oh.
-But I came along with Darcy.

45:56.318 --> 45:57.276
Hmm. That's nice.

45:57.406 --> 45:58.712
Hello.

45:58.843 --> 46:00.235
Can we interest
you guys in a game?

46:00.366 --> 46:02.498
I appreciate the offer,

46:02.629 --> 46:05.284
but, uh, I had knee
surgery earlier this year.

46:05.414 --> 46:06.633
Yeah, I gotta take
it easy for now.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.940
-Mm.
-Well, we understand.

46:09.070 --> 46:10.506
Well, we're gonna
go grab a drink.

46:10.637 --> 46:11.594
Nice to see you.

46:11.725 --> 46:12.508
-Okay.
-Nice meeting you.

46:12.639 --> 46:13.988
-Bye.
-Bye-Bye.

46:15.729 --> 46:17.339
Perfect. He's getting a drink.

46:17.470 --> 46:19.124
Good, I could really
use a glass of wine.

46:19.254 --> 46:21.169
No, I gotta do this alone,

46:21.300 --> 46:23.998
I, I can't risk, like,
your distractions.

46:24.129 --> 46:26.827
Oh, um, well, I
guess I could go-

46:26.958 --> 46:29.047
Talk to a manager of the club.

46:29.177 --> 46:30.526
Yes. Why?

46:30.657 --> 46:33.225
'Cause you won't stop
bragging that you know him.

46:33.355 --> 46:36.010
My God, are you
sleeping with him too?

46:36.141 --> 46:37.316
Don't.

46:37.446 --> 46:38.317
No!

46:39.535 --> 46:40.885
Do whatever you
want, just don't get

46:41.015 --> 46:42.103
in the way of my plan.

46:49.197 --> 46:50.459
We meet again.

46:50.590 --> 46:51.939
Do you mind if I take a seat?

46:52.070 --> 46:54.768
Uh, sure. Where's Darcy?

46:54.899 --> 46:57.727
Oh, she's off yapping to
the manager of the club,

46:57.858 --> 47:00.426
and apparently they're
old friends from college.

47:00.556 --> 47:02.036
So, what are we drinking?

47:02.167 --> 47:03.516
Uh, whiskey, neat.

47:04.909 --> 47:06.171
Sounds delicious.

47:10.610 --> 47:13.352
So, how are you enjoying
the pageant so far?

47:13.482 --> 47:15.397
You know what? I think
it's going great.

47:15.528 --> 47:18.183
There are some really
impressive contestants.

47:18.313 --> 47:19.401
Hmm, that's good to hear.

47:19.532 --> 47:22.056
Mm-hmm.

47:22.187 --> 47:23.014
You know, pageants
have been around

47:23.144 --> 47:25.451
for a very long
time in my family.

47:25.581 --> 47:26.756
My mother was Miss Teen-

47:26.887 --> 47:28.802
Oh, I'm aware of
who your mother is.

47:28.933 --> 47:32.980
She's a legend. So
many crowns.

47:37.463 --> 47:39.421
What's a girl got to do to
get a drink around here?

47:39.552 --> 47:41.380
Oh, you know, I think
she'll be right back.

47:42.381 --> 47:44.209
You mind if I take
a sip of yours?

47:45.253 --> 47:46.602
Uh, sure.

47:50.998 --> 47:51.738
Hmm.

47:54.175 --> 47:56.525
You know, I think it's
a great group this year.

47:57.918 --> 48:00.181
There's a lot of very
experienced contestants.

48:00.312 --> 48:01.400
Me.

48:01.530 --> 48:03.881
And those new to the
competition as well.

48:04.011 --> 48:07.754
Yes. Emilia and
Sophie.

48:10.104 --> 48:12.585
Huh, it's nice to have
newcomers, don't you think?

48:12.715 --> 48:14.848
You know, I wouldn't
have imagined

48:14.979 --> 48:17.503
that they're new to
pageant competitions.

48:17.633 --> 48:21.072
One thing I can say, it is
a very tight race so far.

48:25.990 --> 48:29.254
Enough shoptalk, how
about another round, hm?

48:38.132 --> 48:43.007
Girls, I am so happy
to have you all here

48:43.137 --> 48:45.923
for my annual pageant
sleepover.

48:46.053 --> 48:47.185
Yes!

48:47.315 --> 48:49.970
Now, everyone in here has
made it to the top five.

48:50.101 --> 48:54.192
But let's face it, no matter
who wins, we are all winners.

48:54.322 --> 48:56.194
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoo!

48:56.324 --> 48:57.325
Anyway,
let's go ahead

48:57.456 --> 48:59.545
and drink up before
my parents get home

48:59.675 --> 49:01.155
and we get caught
drinking their booze.

49:01.286 --> 49:02.113
Yeah, we should.

49:03.418 --> 49:04.854
Cheers.

49:04.985 --> 49:07.292
Here's to watching
our mothers try

49:07.422 --> 49:10.991
to recapture their youth and
not go absolutely insane.

49:11.122 --> 49:12.819
-Cheers to survive.
-Cheers.

49:13.994 --> 49:15.300
Yes!

49:15.430 --> 49:17.171
Yes!

49:17.302 --> 49:19.391
Thank you for agreeing
to show me around.

49:19.521 --> 49:21.915
I think I'm gonna get a
membership here after all.

49:22.046 --> 49:23.134
Well, maybe next time
I'll take you up on

49:23.264 --> 49:25.266
that pickleball match.

49:25.397 --> 49:26.441
I'm gonna hold you to it.

49:28.269 --> 49:31.055
Well, it's getting late.

49:31.185 --> 49:33.274
Oh, are you heading
home so soon?

49:33.405 --> 49:35.276
Adeline, what are you doing?

49:35.407 --> 49:36.321
Well, the night is still young.

49:36.451 --> 49:37.452
Adeline!

49:39.324 --> 49:40.716
I think we both have interests

49:40.847 --> 49:42.153
that could benefit one another.

49:43.589 --> 49:45.156
Are you trying to bribe me?

49:46.374 --> 49:47.245
Because if you are,
you should know

49:47.375 --> 49:49.725
that's an automatic
disqualification.

49:49.856 --> 49:52.467
Wait, this is
a big misunderstanding.

49:52.598 --> 49:54.774
No, I, I don't think it is.

49:54.904 --> 49:57.168
I mean, can't you tell
when you're barking up

49:57.298 --> 49:58.952
the wrong tree, Adeline?

49:59.083 --> 50:01.476
I'm sorry, but the
rules are the rules.

50:01.607 --> 50:03.043
I'm gonna have to report this.

50:03.174 --> 50:04.349
What? You're gonna report this?

50:04.479 --> 50:05.263
Yes.

50:08.875 --> 50:10.355
Do you really think that I need

50:10.485 --> 50:12.879
to proposition a
judge in order to win?

50:13.749 --> 50:15.273
Do you know who I am?

50:15.403 --> 50:16.361
I do.

50:16.491 --> 50:18.363
You're Rebecca
Bordeaux's daughter,

50:18.493 --> 50:20.713
and that does not
make you untouchable.

50:20.843 --> 50:23.281
Oh.

50:23.411 --> 50:24.978
-Adeline?
-Cyrus.

50:25.109 --> 50:26.240
-Adeline?
-Cyrus.

50:26.371 --> 50:27.154
Adeline?

50:27.285 --> 50:29.200
-I'm very touchable.
-Adeline?

50:31.419 --> 50:32.377
Touch.

50:46.652 --> 50:49.046
Hey, Dad, I got your message.

50:49.176 --> 50:51.048
I really wish I could
fly out and see you,

50:51.178 --> 50:55.269
but with all this pageant
stuff, Mom would kill me.

50:55.400 --> 50:56.662
But thank you for the invite,

50:56.792 --> 50:58.925
and I really hope I see you
when you're back in town.

50:59.056 --> 50:59.882
Love you.

51:01.928 --> 51:03.234
Hey.

51:03.364 --> 51:04.365
Hey.

51:04.496 --> 51:05.671
Are you okay?

51:05.801 --> 51:07.586
Yeah, it's just, um...

51:09.457 --> 51:10.893
Do you wanna talk about it?

51:12.591 --> 51:14.375
It's my dad's
birthday this week,

51:14.506 --> 51:16.160
and he's in Montreal for work.

51:16.290 --> 51:19.293
He works at this,
like, big tech company,

51:19.424 --> 51:21.600
but he was gonna fly
me out and sightsee

51:21.730 --> 51:23.428
and get dinner and
all of that stuff.

51:23.558 --> 51:24.429
That's so cool.

51:24.559 --> 51:27.171
Yeah, but, I mean,
I'm not going.

51:27.997 --> 51:29.260
Because of the pageant.

51:29.390 --> 51:31.392
It would be a quick trip,
and it doesn't interfere

51:31.523 --> 51:35.092
with any of the events, but
my mom would, like, freak out.

51:35.222 --> 51:37.442
It's like any time I wanna
spend time with my dad

51:37.572 --> 51:40.053
it just ends up in, like,
a screaming match with her.

51:41.576 --> 51:44.536
She doesn't want you to
spend time with him at all?

51:44.666 --> 51:46.668
It must be hard on you.

51:46.799 --> 51:48.366
I'm just trying to keep the
peace until I can graduate

51:48.496 --> 51:50.107
and get the hell outta here.

51:50.237 --> 51:53.197
Well, is he at least coming
to the pageant final?

51:53.327 --> 51:55.112
No, that's my mom's turf.

51:56.461 --> 51:57.984
But, we should head back inside.

51:59.290 --> 52:01.988
Yeah.

52:08.516 --> 52:10.301
Darcy seems
very distracted.

52:11.215 --> 52:12.303
What's that all about?

52:14.043 --> 52:16.176
I don't know.

52:16.307 --> 52:18.135
Shame about what
happened to that judge.

52:19.832 --> 52:21.442
Yeah.

52:21.573 --> 52:23.314
I got word before he died
that he was quite fond

52:23.444 --> 52:24.315
of Emilia and Sophie.

52:25.707 --> 52:26.795
Pity for them.

52:26.926 --> 52:28.145
But lucky break for you.

52:29.755 --> 52:33.846
I don't need a judge to die
in order to win, Mother.

52:36.109 --> 52:37.502
But now that he's taken care of.

52:39.286 --> 52:41.158
That's an odd way to phrase it.

52:42.333 --> 52:45.597
I just mean that if
he so clearly favored

52:45.727 --> 52:49.383
certain contestants, the
playing field's open again.

52:50.515 --> 52:52.386
And you want
Lilliana and I to win

52:52.517 --> 52:55.084
more than anything,
right, Mother?

53:03.092 --> 53:04.006
Hello, Faye.

53:05.704 --> 53:07.401
Adeline, I just got
back into the office

53:07.532 --> 53:09.621
and now is not the best time.

53:09.751 --> 53:11.579
This will only
take a few moments.

53:11.710 --> 53:14.147
I wanted to discuss the
appointments of the new judge.

53:15.540 --> 53:18.543
A man just died, Adeline,
have some compassion.

53:18.673 --> 53:21.720
I'm working on finding
a new replacement.

53:21.850 --> 53:24.984
It just so happens I have
someone you should consider.

53:25.114 --> 53:26.507
His name is Warren Sandler.

53:26.638 --> 53:28.640
He's an upstanding businessman,

53:28.770 --> 53:31.643
on the board of several
organizations here in Atlanta.

53:31.773 --> 53:33.427
You know him?

53:33.558 --> 53:34.385
Um...

53:43.307 --> 53:45.526
We support a few of
the same charities.

53:45.657 --> 53:48.355
As you know, I'm very
involved in the community.

53:48.486 --> 53:50.009
It would be a conflict of
interest to appoint a judge

53:50.139 --> 53:51.793
that you know personally.

53:51.924 --> 53:54.405
Besides, I have a few
people in mind already.

53:55.188 --> 53:57.843
My mother's a big fan of Warren,

53:57.973 --> 54:00.541
and between you and I, she's
planning to secure double

54:00.672 --> 54:02.543
the funding for next year.

54:02.674 --> 54:03.936
I don't want to tell
you how to do your job,

54:04.066 --> 54:06.852
but I'm sure it
would go a long way

54:06.982 --> 54:10.159
if you appoint the
judge that she wants.

54:14.207 --> 54:17.819
Faye called, she said that
they selected a new judge.

54:17.950 --> 54:19.256
Warren Sandler.

54:20.822 --> 54:22.520
Interesting choice.

54:24.043 --> 54:26.741
Careful with that, dear.
Caffeine gives you cellulite.

54:29.657 --> 54:30.919
Faye was acting as if
I would be thrilled

54:31.050 --> 54:32.965
with her selection of Warren.

54:33.095 --> 54:35.359
Do you know anything about that?

54:35.489 --> 54:36.577
No, Mother, I don't.

54:41.103 --> 54:43.671
Well, I have some
interesting news.

54:43.802 --> 54:45.804
The pageant hasn't
officially announced it yet,

54:45.934 --> 54:48.807
but a television crew is coming
to film the dress rehearsal.

54:48.937 --> 54:50.287
Really?

54:50.417 --> 54:53.290
Why not
the pageant itself?

54:53.420 --> 54:55.596
Well, they're doing
it documentary style,

54:55.727 --> 54:57.859
showing the behind-the-scenes.

54:57.990 --> 54:59.557
Faye will be doing a
presentation highlighting

54:59.687 --> 55:01.167
my past wins.

55:02.777 --> 55:04.170
Of course.

55:04.301 --> 55:06.999
All eyes will be on the
legacy I built for our family.

55:07.739 --> 55:09.349
You understand that?

55:09.480 --> 55:12.265
What do you expect me to do?

55:12.396 --> 55:15.181
Prove that you can win
something for once in your life.

55:31.240 --> 55:35.506
Okay, Franklin is over
there, and Vanessa is there.

55:37.072 --> 55:38.813
This feels so awkward.

55:38.944 --> 55:40.598
Like what, are we supposed
to just go over there

55:40.728 --> 55:41.686
and sell ourselves?

55:43.296 --> 55:46.168
I think we can just
start with a simple hello.

55:46.299 --> 55:47.256
We'll do it together.

55:47.387 --> 55:48.214
Okay.

55:49.824 --> 55:51.913
So, you ready to
schmooze the judges?

55:52.044 --> 55:53.437
Not, not really.

55:53.567 --> 55:55.613
Hey, you'll be great.

55:55.743 --> 55:58.137
Kind of sad about that
guy, Cyrus, though.

55:58.267 --> 56:00.661
My parents belong to the same
country club where he died.

56:02.794 --> 56:04.839
And no surprise that
Adeline's already cozying up

56:04.970 --> 56:06.537
to the new judge.

56:06.667 --> 56:08.495
It's a tragedy what
happened with Cyrus,

56:08.626 --> 56:11.716
but I'm glad something
wonderful could come out of it.

56:12.978 --> 56:14.632
I'm so excited that
you're the new judge.

56:14.762 --> 56:16.111
Yeah, me too.

56:16.242 --> 56:17.939
You know you've
already got my vote.

56:18.070 --> 56:20.725
It's the other two
judges I'd worry about.

56:20.855 --> 56:22.553
What do, what do you mean?

56:22.683 --> 56:25.077
Well, I had a conversation
with Franklin and Vanessa,

56:25.207 --> 56:26.339
seems they're both very endeared

56:26.470 --> 56:27.558
to the newcomers over there.

56:35.479 --> 56:36.523
Excuse me. Excuse me.

56:40.266 --> 56:41.093
Vanessa!

56:42.790 --> 56:43.965
-Adeline.
-Hi.

56:44.096 --> 56:45.619
I'm sorry, I need to make
an important phone call.

56:45.750 --> 56:47.969
Can we regroup inside in a bit?

56:48.100 --> 56:49.928
Yeah, I was hoping I
could get you alone.

56:51.190 --> 56:53.845
All right, I guess I
have a few minutes.

56:53.975 --> 56:55.673
I read an article that
you are considering

56:55.803 --> 56:57.196
a run for local office.

56:57.326 --> 56:58.719
That's right.

56:58.850 --> 57:01.679
Well, our family's very active
in supporting candidates.

57:01.809 --> 57:04.290
In fact, everyone
we've backed has won.

57:06.031 --> 57:06.988
And?

57:07.119 --> 57:08.903
Well, I'm just
saying we both have

57:09.034 --> 57:10.427
something we wanna win here.

57:12.820 --> 57:14.822
You're not attempting to
bribe me, are you, Adeline?

57:14.953 --> 57:17.956
Oh, no, no, of course not.

57:18.086 --> 57:19.610
Um, I'm just pointing
out that we both

57:19.740 --> 57:21.263
have mutual interests.

57:22.656 --> 57:23.440
Right.

57:24.484 --> 57:25.442
If you'll excuse me.

57:27.748 --> 57:29.750
No.

57:29.881 --> 57:32.884
Aw.

57:34.886 --> 57:35.756
You know what she said.

57:35.887 --> 57:37.018
I need you.

57:37.149 --> 57:38.759
-Ouch, Mom, what the hell?
-Stop fraternizing

57:38.890 --> 57:41.196
with your competition and
go impress the judges.

57:41.327 --> 57:42.154
Come with me.

57:44.591 --> 57:46.332
It's good to see
you again, Franklin.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.899
You remember my
daughter, Lilliana?

57:48.029 --> 57:49.248
Hi, nice to see you.

57:49.378 --> 57:50.902
Always a pleasure.

57:53.992 --> 57:55.559
What are you majoring
in next year at college?

57:55.689 --> 57:56.864
Finance.

57:56.995 --> 57:59.693
You know, I offer
internships at my company.

57:59.824 --> 58:00.868
That'd be perfect
for you, honey.

58:00.999 --> 58:03.088
You guys should
exchange numbers.

58:03.218 --> 58:06.352
I already have a full
course load, but thank you.

58:06.483 --> 58:08.659
Well, in case you
change your mind.

58:10.661 --> 58:13.881
That's my personal
cell number on there.

58:16.188 --> 58:17.798
-Lilliana.
-Mom.

58:17.929 --> 58:18.538
What the hell was that?

58:18.669 --> 58:20.627
He's a prominent businessman,

58:20.758 --> 58:22.673
you'd be lucky to
intern with him.

58:22.803 --> 58:25.763
You didn't see the way
he was leering at me?

58:25.893 --> 58:26.894
You're
a pageant girl.

58:27.025 --> 58:27.852
You parade your body on stage,

58:27.982 --> 58:29.897
you don't want a
man to look at you?

58:31.333 --> 58:33.814
Just when I thought you
couldn't get any worse.

58:43.998 --> 58:45.609
So, how do you think it went?

58:45.739 --> 58:47.654
That Warren guy was
pretty hard to read,

58:47.785 --> 58:51.179
and Franklin was
kind of friendly.

58:51.310 --> 58:53.878
A little too
friendly for my liking.

58:54.008 --> 58:55.488
I know.

58:55.619 --> 58:57.403
I'm gonna use the
restroom really quick.

59:04.192 --> 59:05.803
Ooh, here, let me
help you with that.

59:05.933 --> 59:07.065
Uh-huh,
thank you, thank you.

59:07.195 --> 59:08.109
Of course.

59:09.241 --> 59:13.114
Ugh, wow. I'm a bit
of a mess today.

59:13.245 --> 59:14.246
Is everything okay?

59:15.682 --> 59:16.988
No.

59:17.118 --> 59:20.165
My mother is ill and I just
called to check in and...

59:20.295 --> 59:22.254
But I understand.

59:22.384 --> 59:25.649
I lost my husband
to cancer recently.

59:25.779 --> 59:27.520
I remember you mentioned
that during your interview.

59:27.651 --> 59:28.521
I'm so sorry.

59:28.652 --> 59:29.522
Thank you.

59:30.828 --> 59:33.395
I think it's nice that
you and your daughter

59:33.526 --> 59:35.006
are doing this pageant
together for the first time,

59:35.136 --> 59:37.356
after such a big loss.

59:37.486 --> 59:38.531
What made you enter?

59:39.750 --> 59:43.014
Truthfully, we really
need the money.

59:43.144 --> 59:45.973
I'm drowning in medical
bills from my husband,

59:46.104 --> 59:48.062
I'm a new business owner,
and that takes time to build,

59:48.193 --> 59:50.891
and my daughter has this
incredible opportunity

59:51.022 --> 59:53.285
to study in London, but the
cost is just more than...

59:55.504 --> 59:58.072
I'm, I'm sorry, I shouldn't
be laying this all on you.

59:58.203 --> 01:00:00.771
No, no, I completely understand.

01:00:00.901 --> 01:00:03.512
I've had my share financial
issues in the past.

01:00:03.643 --> 01:00:05.166
It's not always easy,

01:00:05.297 --> 01:00:07.516
especially after losing
someone you love.

01:00:07.647 --> 01:00:08.474
Thank you.

01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:12.826
Just, I don't understand
why aren't these judges

01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:15.263
so impressed with
Emilia and Sophie?

01:00:15.394 --> 01:00:17.309
Uh, at least Cyrus is gone.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.139
Well, that's kind of an
awful thing to say, isn't it?

01:00:21.269 --> 01:00:22.662
The man died.

01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:24.403
But he wasn't gonna vote for me.

01:00:25.534 --> 01:00:27.624
Adeline, please tell
me you had nothing

01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:28.973
to do with his death.

01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:31.715
Are you accusing me?

01:00:31.845 --> 01:00:34.239
No, no, no, I am sorry,

01:00:34.369 --> 01:00:37.068
I just know how much
you want the crown.

01:00:37.198 --> 01:00:37.764
You're really not
someone who should

01:00:37.895 --> 01:00:40.549
be throwing stones, Darcy.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.378
What do you mean? I
never hurt anybody.

01:00:43.509 --> 01:00:46.033
Oh, cheating on your
husband isn't hurting him?

01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:49.080
Instead of these accusations,
you should be helping me.

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.429
That's our deal.

01:00:50.559 --> 01:00:51.952
What am I supposed to do?

01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:55.434
-Is somebody there?
-Shh.

01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:03.007
I don't see anybody.

01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:04.530
Let's get back,
we can talk later.

01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:14.192
-Oh, this is cute.
-I love that.

01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:15.410
-Sorry, um.
-Hey.

01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:18.805
Hey, can I talk to you
for a minute in private?

01:01:18.936 --> 01:01:19.806
Yeah, sure.

01:01:19.937 --> 01:01:20.981
-Bye.
-See ya.

01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:23.027
What's up?

01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:26.160
Adeline knows about
your mom's affair.

01:01:29.294 --> 01:01:30.469
Why would she tell her?

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:32.950
Adeline is a huge gossip.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.040
Maybe she didn't and Adeline
found out on her own.

01:01:37.258 --> 01:01:39.608
I heard them arguing
about something,

01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:42.699
said they had a deal,
that she should help her.

01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:43.874
Why would she do that?

01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:46.311
I don't know.

01:01:49.923 --> 01:01:51.185
But you remember how
I said I was going

01:01:51.316 --> 01:01:52.578
to put a stop to all this?

01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:54.972
Perfect timing.

01:01:58.627 --> 01:02:01.065
Right. Yes.

01:02:01.195 --> 01:02:03.110
Mom, can I talk to
you for a second?

01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:04.459
Honey, why aren't you
out there socializing

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:05.591
with the judges?

01:02:06.505 --> 01:02:08.594
I'll give you two a moment.

01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:12.032
I have to show you something.

01:02:12.163 --> 01:02:13.120
Can't it wait until later?

01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:15.253
We only have so much
time with the judges.

01:02:15.383 --> 01:02:16.907
No, it can't.

01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:27.918
Where did you get this?

01:02:28.048 --> 01:02:29.267
I took it.

01:02:29.397 --> 01:02:30.355
when?

01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:31.748
Not that long ago.

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:36.187
The Italian restaurant
around the corner.

01:02:36.317 --> 01:02:39.407
When you lied to Dad, said
that you had errands to run.

01:02:41.018 --> 01:02:43.498
I cannot believe you're
sleeping with Tatum's dad, Mom.

01:02:43.629 --> 01:02:45.239
How can you stand
there just talking

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.632
and laughing with Mackenzie?

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:47.938
Shh.

01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:50.767
Honey, I am so sorry.

01:02:50.897 --> 01:02:53.030
Mom, how could you do that?

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.249
I'm so sorry.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.077
How can I make this up to you?

01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:58.905
-Honey, please.
-Make it up to me?

01:03:00.124 --> 01:03:01.212
You can walk over
there and tell Faye

01:03:01.342 --> 01:03:02.474
that we quit the pageant.

01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:05.390
-No.
-Do it right now, Mom,

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.045
or I send this photo to every
single person in this room.

01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:09.655
Honey, please.

01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:13.224
Why do you wanna quit? We're...

01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:17.968
I am not telling Dad about the
affair, it would crush him.

01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:21.406
But I am not doing this anymore.

01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:24.409
And maybe if you get out of
this crazy pageant world,

01:03:24.539 --> 01:03:26.324
you'll remember what's
really important.

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:35.594
My father went into
hospice.

01:03:35.724 --> 01:03:38.466
We don't know how much
longer he has left.

01:03:38.597 --> 01:03:41.600
Oh, Darcy, I am so sorry.

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:42.688
Of course, we're disappointed

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.430
to lose you both
from the competition.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.824
Please let us know if there's
anything that we can do.

01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:59.183
Whoa, what's happening?

01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:01.315
My life is over.

01:04:02.534 --> 01:04:03.361
That's dramatic.

01:04:04.623 --> 01:04:06.190
Mia found out about
the affair.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.410
Ugh, I told you, you're
being too sloppy.

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:12.109
She found a photo of
us, and she threatened

01:04:12.239 --> 01:04:14.372
to expose me if I don't
drop outta the pageant.

01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:17.679
It's her way of
getting back at me.

01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:21.118
Tough break.

01:04:25.209 --> 01:04:26.166
That's it?

01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:29.039
That's all you're
gonna say to me?

01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:34.174
Darcy, we're connected
by the pageant,

01:04:34.305 --> 01:04:37.482
it's not like we
have a friendship

01:04:37.612 --> 01:04:39.136
outside of this world.

01:04:56.457 --> 01:04:58.198
Mia, where are you going?

01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:00.244
Why don't you ask your mom?

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:01.898
What?

01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:05.205
I'm sorry, Lilliana.

01:05:06.685 --> 01:05:08.948
I like you, we're friends,

01:05:09.079 --> 01:05:12.212
but your mom is
not a nice person.

01:05:12.343 --> 01:05:13.866
And I'm sorry to say that,

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:16.347
but there is something
seriously wrong with her.

01:05:16.477 --> 01:05:19.741
I've lived with her
for 18 years. I know.

01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:21.091
Just, what did she do?

01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:26.009
Well, for starters, she's
blackmailing my mom.

01:05:26.139 --> 01:05:27.140
Are you serious?

01:05:27.271 --> 01:05:28.141
Mm-hmm.

01:05:28.272 --> 01:05:30.143
What does she even
want from her?

01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:34.104
I don't know exactly, but I
hope you figure it out soon,

01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:35.627
before things get worse.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:37.977
I gotta go.

01:05:38.108 --> 01:05:39.239
Okay. See ya.

01:05:46.507 --> 01:05:49.119
Hey, um, have you seen Mia?

01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:51.338
She, she just left.

01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:53.732
Do you know what's going
on between her and my mom?

01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:58.302
Sophie, please, if you know
something you have to tell me.

01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:08.660
Darcy, are you okay?

01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:10.618
No.

01:06:12.446 --> 01:06:15.580
And Emilia, you should
watch your back.

01:06:33.467 --> 01:06:35.165
I like the color of this dress.

01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:38.472
But this dress looks way
more flattering on you.

01:06:38.603 --> 01:06:40.474
Let's try them both on.

01:06:40.605 --> 01:06:43.521
Lilliana, what's your problem?

01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:44.652
Get with it, we're
down to the wire.

01:06:44.783 --> 01:06:46.480
I'm doing all the work.

01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:48.004
What work are you doing, Mom?

01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:50.006
Excuse me?

01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:54.314
Oh, let me guess, your
father's in your ear again,

01:06:54.445 --> 01:06:56.012
poisoning you against me.

01:06:56.142 --> 01:06:58.318
No, you do a good enough
job of that yourself.

01:06:58.449 --> 01:07:00.233
He always resented pageants.

01:07:00.364 --> 01:07:02.279
He never supported your dreams.

01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:03.758
That is not true.

01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:07.501
Oh, really, then why wasn't
he at your last pageant,

01:07:07.632 --> 01:07:09.503
when you won the crown?

01:07:09.634 --> 01:07:12.028
Because he was stuck at
work with an emergency.

01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:14.030
You remember that. All
of the servers went down.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.553
No.

01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:17.816
Lilliana, he was holed up in
some hotel with his assistant.

01:07:17.946 --> 01:07:19.513
No, Mom, that's not true.

01:07:19.644 --> 01:07:21.472
You know that's not true.

01:07:21.602 --> 01:07:22.690
Dad didn't cheat on you.

01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:26.303
Come on, Lilliana, you
are not a stupid girl.

01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:27.826
No, Mom, I'm not.

01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:33.788
You know what?

01:07:33.919 --> 01:07:35.573
I don't like either
of these for you.

01:07:36.965 --> 01:07:38.010
I'm gonna call the boutique

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:39.881
and have them send
over some more options.

01:07:45.017 --> 01:07:45.800
You reached Patrick.

01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:48.238
Leave a message,
I'll get back to you.

01:07:48.368 --> 01:07:51.415
Hey, Dad, can you
give me a call back?

01:07:51.545 --> 01:07:52.894
It's about Mom.

01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:19.878
-Hey.
-Hey, how's it going?

01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:22.315
Well, my mom is devastated

01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:23.837
that I made her
quit the pageant.

01:08:23.969 --> 01:08:26.450
But other than that,
everything's great.

01:08:28.495 --> 01:08:30.018
What's up with you?

01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:31.541
I was looking
through some articles

01:08:31.672 --> 01:08:32.978
about that girl, Harper.

01:08:33.978 --> 01:08:35.067
Harper?

01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:36.547
Really? Why?

01:08:36.676 --> 01:08:39.027
Don't you think it's weird
that she was killed so close

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:40.464
to the pageant last year?

01:08:41.856 --> 01:08:45.729
Well, it was awful, but
what do you mean by weird?

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:49.777
Did the police ever suspect
anyone from the pageant?

01:08:49.907 --> 01:08:51.214
Um, the case was closed

01:08:51.344 --> 01:08:53.825
as a random robbery
pretty quickly.

01:08:53.955 --> 01:08:56.262
I mean, they talked to all
of us girls and our parents,

01:08:56.393 --> 01:08:59.352
but I never got the feeling
they thought any of us did it.

01:08:59.483 --> 01:09:01.572
Was, was the pageant
unusually intense

01:09:01.702 --> 01:09:03.139
that year or something?

01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:06.794
No, it was just a normal
amount of tension, I would say.

01:09:08.492 --> 01:09:10.755
Although, there was this one
thing Harper was worried about.

01:09:10.885 --> 01:09:11.669
What was it?

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:15.716
Well, you know that
judge, Franklin,

01:09:15.846 --> 01:09:18.545
apparently he came on to
her and she rejected him.

01:09:18.675 --> 01:09:20.504
Harper was worried that people

01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:22.288
would think she was
favorite to win.

01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:24.334
Did any of the other
contestants know that?

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.511
Well, there were rumors,

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.513
but it was squashed
pretty quickly.

01:09:34.996 --> 01:09:37.999
So, certain contestants
knew that Harper

01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:39.086
was favored by Franklin?

01:09:39.218 --> 01:09:40.393
Exactly.

01:09:40.523 --> 01:09:43.353
And what if Adeline was
one of those people?

01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:46.703
Hey, remember, you said Cyrus

01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:49.794
was really complimentary
of us, right?

01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:51.012
Yeah.

01:09:51.143 --> 01:09:52.449
Did Adeline know that?

01:09:52.578 --> 01:09:53.580
It's possible.

01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:57.323
Mom, if Adeline is
responsible for Cyrus

01:09:57.454 --> 01:10:00.544
or Harper's death, we
have to do something.

01:10:04.504 --> 01:10:05.375
Oh, it's Lilliana.

01:10:06.593 --> 01:10:08.639
She wants to talk.

01:10:08.769 --> 01:10:10.554
I didn't tell her about
Darcy's affair yesterday

01:10:10.684 --> 01:10:12.512
because I felt like
that was Mia's place

01:10:12.643 --> 01:10:14.121
to decide whether she
should know or not.

01:10:14.253 --> 01:10:15.428
Right.

01:10:15.559 --> 01:10:18.300
But she seemed really
upset about her mom.

01:10:18.431 --> 01:10:19.476
You know what?

01:10:20.303 --> 01:10:22.653
Speaking of Darcy, I think I
should pay her a visit today.

01:10:22.782 --> 01:10:24.350
Try to figure out
exactly why she

01:10:24.481 --> 01:10:25.873
was warning me about Adeline.

01:10:26.004 --> 01:10:27.788
Do you think she'll talk to you?

01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:29.529
It's worth a try.

01:10:40.671 --> 01:10:42.977
-Hi.
-Emilia.

01:10:43.108 --> 01:10:44.240
What are you doing here?

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:48.156
This really isn't a good time.

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:50.550
I just wanted to
talk about yesterday.

01:10:51.898 --> 01:10:52.900
Do you know?

01:10:54.815 --> 01:10:56.252
About your affair?

01:10:57.209 --> 01:10:59.255
-Yes.
-Shh.

01:10:59.385 --> 01:11:02.996
My husband is home,
please, I haven't told him.

01:11:03.128 --> 01:11:04.564
I have no intentions
of revealing your

01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:05.957
personal business.

01:11:06.087 --> 01:11:07.871
I just wanted to
know what you meant

01:11:08.002 --> 01:11:10.614
when you were warning me to
watch my back around Adeline.

01:11:12.311 --> 01:11:14.966
I'm sorry, Emilia,
I really shouldn't

01:11:15.096 --> 01:11:17.447
be talking to you about Adeline.

01:11:17.577 --> 01:11:19.536
Why are you so scared of her?

01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:21.189
Is it because of your
affair, or something else?

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.539
Okay, please.

01:11:27.674 --> 01:11:31.287
Look, I don't know
anything for sure.

01:11:31.416 --> 01:11:33.637
Darcy, mother to mother,

01:11:33.767 --> 01:11:35.856
if Adeline has done
something awful,

01:11:35.987 --> 01:11:37.815
you don't want her hurting
anyone else, right?

01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:44.952
Adeline was at the country
club the night Cyrus died.

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:47.737
I left early, she stayed.

01:11:47.868 --> 01:11:49.043
Why was she there?

01:11:49.174 --> 01:11:51.307
Because she believes he
favored you and Sophie.

01:11:51.437 --> 01:11:52.090
-Ugh.
-She wanted

01:11:52.219 --> 01:11:53.960
to convince him otherwise.

01:11:55.746 --> 01:11:57.487
Do you think she killed him?

01:11:57.617 --> 01:11:58.749
I can't be involved.

01:11:58.879 --> 01:11:59.619
No, no, wait. Hey, hey.

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:00.664
Hey, okay.

01:12:02.013 --> 01:12:04.276
Does the country club
have security cameras?

01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:06.800
I don't know, but my friend,
he's the manager there,

01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:08.280
he said the police have
already looked into this.

01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:10.804
Can you just ask him and see?

01:12:10.934 --> 01:12:12.371
He's on vacation right now,

01:12:12.502 --> 01:12:16.723
but I'll do my
best to reach him.

01:12:16.853 --> 01:12:18.638
Okay. Thank you.

01:12:38.657 --> 01:12:40.921
Is it about the footage
from the country club?

01:12:41.052 --> 01:12:42.793
Darcy spoke to the manager.

01:12:42.923 --> 01:12:45.143
Someone on the maintenance
crew set up trail cameras

01:12:45.273 --> 01:12:48.451
to watch for animals that could
cause damage to the course.

01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:49.669
Apparently they're going
through the footage,

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.541
but it's gonna take time.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.934
Time that we don't have.

01:12:55.066 --> 01:12:57.242
Come on.

01:12:59.287 --> 01:13:02.334
♪ Ooh-Hoo-hoo

01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:05.946
We've got 45 minutes
dress rehearsal, everyone.

01:13:06.077 --> 01:13:06.860
Mom, guess what?

01:13:06.991 --> 01:13:08.601
Oh, Lilliana, not right now.

01:13:08.732 --> 01:13:10.429
You're gonna want to hear this.

01:13:10.559 --> 01:13:11.865
I just got us Franklin's vote.

01:13:12.952 --> 01:13:15.173
What? How do you know?

01:13:15.303 --> 01:13:17.175
I took your advice.

01:13:17.305 --> 01:13:22.049
Had a, you know, productive
conversation with him.

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.746
He assured me his vote was ours.

01:13:23.877 --> 01:13:24.704
Oh...

01:13:26.097 --> 01:13:26.837
Okay.

01:13:29.621 --> 01:13:31.450
Glad to see you're
comin' around, honey.

01:13:32.755 --> 01:13:34.844
All right, now that
we have Warren's vote

01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:38.152
and Franklin's vote, I
guess we have nothing

01:13:38.282 --> 01:13:39.415
to worry about then.

01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:40.546
Yeah, we're good.

01:13:42.156 --> 01:13:43.549
I'm gonna go put some lipstick
on before we go on camera.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.768
Sounds good.

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:55.387
She bought it.

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:56.954
Okay, at least we
don't have to worry

01:13:57.084 --> 01:13:58.259
about your mom thinking
we're a threat.

01:13:58.389 --> 01:14:00.305
Yeah, you guys are good.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:01.132
-Okay.
-I'll see you back there.

01:14:01.262 --> 01:14:01.959
Okay.

01:14:04.091 --> 01:14:06.702
Hi, sweetheart. Everything okay?

01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:09.009
Yeah, Grandma. Why?

01:14:09.139 --> 01:14:12.012
You seem to have been a bit
off these past few days.

01:14:12.143 --> 01:14:14.537
I, I just think it's
stress from the pageant.

01:14:14.666 --> 01:14:16.974
I mean, you know
how that is, right?

01:14:17.103 --> 01:14:18.584
You sure there's
nothing else going on

01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:19.933
that I should be aware of?

01:14:20.064 --> 01:14:21.934
No, everything is fine.

01:14:23.284 --> 01:14:25.896
Well, then thank you for
carrying this pageant

01:14:26.026 --> 01:14:27.419
for you and your mother.

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:29.856
I think we both know who the
real star of the family is.

01:14:31.031 --> 01:14:32.990
-I love you, sweetheart.
-Hm, I love you.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.906
-I'm gonna go get ready.
-Okay. Good luck.

01:14:50.268 --> 01:14:51.661
Hey, I'll be right back.

01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:59.320
Darcy, any news?

01:14:59.451 --> 01:15:00.887
They found something.

01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:03.063
There is clear
footage of Adeline

01:15:03.193 --> 01:15:06.110
and Cyrus walking together
close to where he died.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.764
Can you send that to me?

01:15:07.894 --> 01:15:08.895
I'll text it over.

01:15:09.026 --> 01:15:11.071
Are you gonna turn
this into the police?

01:15:11.202 --> 01:15:14.987
Yes, but it doesn't
really prove anything.

01:15:15.119 --> 01:15:18.296
There's no real footage
of Adeline doing it.

01:15:18.425 --> 01:15:19.732
The police will question her,

01:15:19.862 --> 01:15:22.039
but if it's not
enough for an arrest,

01:15:22.169 --> 01:15:24.520
I am terrified of
what she'll do then.

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.835
Sophie!

01:15:35.966 --> 01:15:38.272
Why are you fumbling around?

01:15:38.403 --> 01:15:40.231
I can't find my shoes.

01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:42.755
Well, can you look a bit more
quietly and on your side?

01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:45.062
I'd like some peace
before we go on camera.

01:15:46.933 --> 01:15:49.022
Sophie, did you leave
them in the car?

01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:51.721
I'll go check.

01:16:04.603 --> 01:16:06.213
Can, can I help you?

01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:08.912
Oh, hi, um...

01:16:10.174 --> 01:16:12.263
Hi, I'm Lilliana's father.

01:16:12.393 --> 01:16:14.874
Are, are you one
of the contestants?

01:16:15.005 --> 01:16:17.094
Yeah. I'm Sophie.

01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:18.835
Yeah, Lilliana
told me about you.

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:21.880
She told me everything.

01:16:22.012 --> 01:16:24.928
And if it's all true, if
Adeline really hurt someone,

01:16:25.058 --> 01:16:27.974
I just gotta make
sure Lilliana's okay.

01:16:28.105 --> 01:16:30.193
Then why are you sneaking
around the building?

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:32.978
Well, I'm trying
to find the best way in,

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:35.503
because if I call
Lilliana, or if I text her

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:38.724
and my ex-wife sees
it, she will lose it.

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.120
Okay, just wait right here.

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:44.077
Okay.

01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:46.950
Thank you.

01:16:53.085 --> 01:16:54.871
Hey, your dad is here.

01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:56.481
Oh my God, he came.

01:17:07.579 --> 01:17:09.059
-My gosh, Dad!
-Hi.

01:17:10.582 --> 01:17:11.670
What are you doing? I
thought you were in Montreal?

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:12.844
I left early.

01:17:12.976 --> 01:17:14.585
I cannot leave you
alone with your mother.

01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:15.413
Thank you.

01:17:15.543 --> 01:17:18.242
So, Darcy sent over the footage,

01:17:18.371 --> 01:17:21.114
and it does prove your mom
was with Cyrus that night,

01:17:21.245 --> 01:17:22.898
near where his body was found.

01:17:23.029 --> 01:17:24.639
Okay, you guys, we have
to go to the police.

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:27.120
I agree, but Darcy doesn't
think it's enough evidence,

01:17:27.251 --> 01:17:28.818
and I'm with her on that.

01:17:30.254 --> 01:17:32.038
All right, so what do we do?

01:17:33.474 --> 01:17:35.825
Adeline thinks she's gonna
win, her guard is down.

01:17:37.522 --> 01:17:39.002
The dress rehearsal
will be broadcast live.

01:17:39.132 --> 01:17:41.134
If we can work together,

01:17:41.264 --> 01:17:43.353
we might be able to get
a confession out of her.

01:17:43.484 --> 01:17:44.268
How?

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:48.011
What if we play the video
in front of everyone?

01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:50.666
I mean, Dad, you're obviously
good with technology,

01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:53.233
you could probably hook
it up to the main stage.

01:17:53.364 --> 01:17:54.974
I mean, yeah.

01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:57.455
I think we have to try.

01:17:57.585 --> 01:17:58.369
Let's do it.

01:18:00.066 --> 01:18:01.285
Okay.

01:18:12.469 --> 01:18:13.993
Come on, come on, come on.

01:18:14.124 --> 01:18:16.648
Yes.

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:28.791
Take your places, ladies.

01:18:28.921 --> 01:18:29.835
You look beautiful.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.360
Right along there. That's right.

01:18:34.448 --> 01:18:35.754
There we go.

01:18:35.885 --> 01:18:37.407
And we're just about ready.

01:18:39.192 --> 01:18:40.759
Ah, this is my moment.

01:18:40.889 --> 01:18:41.717
I mean, ours.

01:18:43.893 --> 01:18:45.590
I think it will be.

01:18:49.202 --> 01:18:52.989
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's showtime.

01:18:53.119 --> 01:18:55.121
I'd like to thank
our audience at home

01:18:55.252 --> 01:18:57.036
for watching us live right now.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:58.559
This is the first
time we've given

01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:00.387
a behind the scenes look to you,

01:19:00.518 --> 01:19:03.173
and we couldn't be more excited.

01:19:03.303 --> 01:19:07.090
Before we get started, I'd
like to welcome a true icon

01:19:07.219 --> 01:19:10.789
of our pageant community
without whose generous support

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.574
this evening would
not be possible.

01:19:13.705 --> 01:19:18.188
The winner of an unprecedented
17 pageant crowns,

01:19:18.318 --> 01:19:22.322
the one, the only,
Rebecca Bordeaux.

01:19:32.332 --> 01:19:35.248
To celebrate Rebecca's
lifetime of accomplishments,

01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:38.817
on and offstage, we've put
together a special presentation

01:19:38.948 --> 01:19:40.950
to honor her incredible legacy.

01:19:48.827 --> 01:19:50.002
What is that.

01:19:50.133 --> 01:19:52.396
Faye, what's going on?

01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:56.487
Uh, uh, I'm so sorry, I don't
know why this is playin'.

01:19:56.617 --> 01:19:58.750
Is that
Adeline and Cyrus?

01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.969
Isn't that where he died?

01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:02.406
What is the meaning of this?

01:20:02.536 --> 01:20:04.538
Uh, I...

01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:06.062
This video is obviously a fake.

01:20:06.192 --> 01:20:07.454
-Mom.
-Hey, hey, stop.

01:20:07.585 --> 01:20:08.151
-Turn it off.
-Mom!

01:20:08.281 --> 01:20:10.066
Off. Turn it, turn it off!

01:20:10.196 --> 01:20:11.545
Right now! Right now!

01:20:11.675 --> 01:20:12.982
Mom, stop!

01:20:13.112 --> 01:20:14.157
Everyone knows your lying.

01:20:16.289 --> 01:20:17.594
I'm so sorry, everyone.

01:20:17.725 --> 01:20:19.510
I don't condone this kind of
behavior from my daughter.

01:20:19.639 --> 01:20:21.120
If you just give
us a few moments.

01:20:21.251 --> 01:20:21.947
Ouch, Mom.

01:20:22.077 --> 01:20:23.601
Adeline, let go of her.

01:20:23.731 --> 01:20:24.689
Get off me.

01:20:26.778 --> 01:20:29.215
This is, you are
doing, isn't it?

01:20:29.346 --> 01:20:30.826
You're trying to turn
my daughter against me

01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:32.566
so that you can win?

01:20:32.697 --> 01:20:34.133
All right, all
right, that's enough.

01:20:34.264 --> 01:20:36.396
That's enough, turn off
those cameras right now.

01:20:36.527 --> 01:20:39.094
-Keep rolling.
-Turn off that camera now!

01:20:39.225 --> 01:20:40.313
Sorry, Mrs. Bordeaux.

01:20:40.443 --> 01:20:42.272
I'm here to broadcast
what happens backstage

01:20:42.402 --> 01:20:43.534
at a dress rehearsal.

01:20:43.664 --> 01:20:45.144
The cameras are staying on.

01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:46.666
Do not turn that camera off.

01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:49.105
You killed Cyrus, didn't you?

01:20:49.235 --> 01:20:51.324
Because he wasn't
going to vote for you?

01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:56.242
How dare you accuse me
of something like that.

01:20:56.373 --> 01:20:58.027
And then he was
replaced by Warren.

01:20:59.376 --> 01:21:03.162
Faye, what made you appoint
him to replace Cyrus?

01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:05.164
Uh...

01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:10.126
He came highly recommended.

01:21:10.255 --> 01:21:11.692
Oh, please, by who?

01:21:12.519 --> 01:21:13.433
Adeline?

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:19.135
Ugh, I'm gonna sue you for
defamation of character.

01:21:19.264 --> 01:21:21.528
This woman has never done
a pageant in her life,

01:21:21.659 --> 01:21:23.922
and she shows up this year.

01:21:24.053 --> 01:21:26.142
Clearly, she has a
vendetta against me.

01:21:26.272 --> 01:21:29.188
Mom, stop lying! Stop!

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:30.581
I did not raise you like this.

01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:32.322
You are acting like your father.

01:21:32.452 --> 01:21:34.889
Adeline. Enough!

01:21:37.282 --> 01:21:39.242
If you'll all excuse
me for a few moments,

01:21:39.371 --> 01:21:41.200
I need some time to
deal with family.

01:21:41.331 --> 01:21:42.985
Mother, I need you outside.

01:21:43.115 --> 01:21:44.638
Stop!

01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:45.987
You're not leaving
until you tell us

01:21:46.118 --> 01:21:47.076
what happened to Harper.

01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:50.383
What about her?

01:21:50.514 --> 01:21:52.603
You killed her too, didn't you?

01:21:52.733 --> 01:21:54.083
You tried to stage
it as a robbery.

01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:57.782
You little bitch!

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.175
Don't you ever come
near my daughter!

01:21:59.305 --> 01:22:00.132
Adeline!

01:22:00.263 --> 01:22:03.179
Adeline, stop this right now!

01:22:03.309 --> 01:22:06.660
You are a disgrace, a
stain on our family.

01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:08.227
Get out of my sight.

01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:12.144
Doesn't that make you happy?

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:14.712
After all these
years, you finally got

01:22:14.842 --> 01:22:16.800
what you've always wanted.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:20.805
A daughter who's
exactly like you.

01:22:29.509 --> 01:22:33.425
I should stab you in your
miserable heart!

01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:38.823
But you won't.

01:22:40.607 --> 01:22:42.261
Can't even do that right.

01:22:54.621 --> 01:22:57.276
Oh no, you're not
going anywhere.

01:23:09.853 --> 01:23:12.291
I did this for you.

01:23:12.422 --> 01:23:15.903
I killed Harper and
Cyrus because of you.

01:23:16.034 --> 01:23:18.862
Because you never
gave me any choice.

01:23:19.951 --> 01:23:21.996
You created all of this.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.826
Why aren't you on my side?

01:23:25.957 --> 01:23:27.827
Why won't you love me?

01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:30.309
What is it about me?

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.442
You've never put me first.

01:23:34.879 --> 01:23:37.708
Why, Mom?

01:23:40.710 --> 01:23:43.496
My God.

01:23:45.063 --> 01:23:46.847
Rebecca, do you
have any comments

01:23:46.978 --> 01:23:49.415
about what's transpired tonight?

01:23:49.546 --> 01:23:51.200
No comment.

01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:53.332
She's not worth a single word.

01:24:01.645 --> 01:24:04.213
M- mom, get back here!

01:24:05.431 --> 01:24:08.260
No!

01:24:15.659 --> 01:24:17.356
Listen, thank you both

01:24:17.487 --> 01:24:18.270
for having me over this morning.

01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:21.012
Of course. We're
glad you came by.

01:24:21.143 --> 01:24:23.362
So, I'm sure you both
heard that the pageant

01:24:23.493 --> 01:24:25.538
has been shut down for good.

01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:27.236
-Mm-hmm.
-But you had my vote.

01:24:29.499 --> 01:24:31.153
So, Emilia, how's everything
going with your spa?

01:24:31.282 --> 01:24:32.458
Oh, excellent.

01:24:32.589 --> 01:24:34.068
Insurance finally came
through to fix the damage,

01:24:34.199 --> 01:24:36.071
so we should be up and running
and on schedule.

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:37.594
Yeah, I'm so happy to hear that.

01:24:37.724 --> 01:24:39.030
Thank you.

01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:42.120
And Sophie, how about
your literature residency?

01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:44.209
Uh, unfortunately,
we were unable

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.558
to scrape the money together.

01:24:46.907 --> 01:24:48.344
I can help.

01:24:48.474 --> 01:24:50.650
I'd love to sponsor
your residency.

01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:52.348
What? Wait, what?

01:24:52.478 --> 01:24:53.218
Are, are you sure?

01:24:53.349 --> 01:24:54.350
Absolutely.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.786
You deserved that win.

01:24:55.916 --> 01:24:57.092
It's my pleasure to help out.

01:24:57.222 --> 01:24:58.136
Oh, Mom!

01:24:58.267 --> 01:25:00.050
That is so generous
of you, Vanessa.

01:25:00.182 --> 01:25:01.443
Thank you, truly.

01:25:01.574 --> 01:25:03.010
Thank you so much.

01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:05.577
My pleasure.

01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:08.320
-Ah, you're going to London.
-I'm going to London.

01:25:08.451 --> 01:25:09.278
Yes!

01:25:09.407 --> 01:25:12.324
-Let's do a cheers.
-Yeah!

01:25:12.455 --> 01:25:14.544
-To London.
-To London!

01:25:16.198 --> 01:25:18.460
I've been
to London many times.

01:25:18.591 --> 01:25:20.202
So what's the first
thing you wanna see?

01:25:20.332 --> 01:25:22.987
Gosh, I mean, I
don't know. Everything.
