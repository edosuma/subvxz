00:24.177 --> 00:26.046
<i>Tasha, baby?</i>

00:26.179 --> 00:27.848
<i>Yeah, Tony, what is it?</i>

00:27.981 --> 00:30.649
<i>Let's run away tonight.</i>

00:32.118 --> 00:33.019
<i>Baby?</i>

00:33.954 --> 00:36.056
Hello? Hello?

00:37.190 --> 00:39.425
- Hello, are you there?
- <i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

00:39.558 --> 00:42.295
Oh, did you lose service
or something?

00:42.428 --> 00:44.030
<i>No, it's got full bars.</i>

00:44.164 --> 00:45.165
Oh, okay.

00:45.298 --> 00:46.432
<i>I can hear you just fine.</i>

00:46.565 --> 00:48.001
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

00:48.134 --> 00:51.872
Yeah, I'll pick you up in 20
and we can be in Baja.

00:52.005 --> 00:54.908
- 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning...
- <i>Wait, wait, hold on,</i>

00:55.041 --> 00:56.642
<i>Tony,
what are you talking about?</i>

00:56.877 --> 00:58.979
Do you have any sunscreen?
I forgot to get some sunscreen.

00:59.112 --> 01:00.679
<i>Tony, are you being
serious right now?</i>

01:00.813 --> 01:02.949
Remember when I said that
I wanted to run away

01:03.083 --> 01:04.351
with you to Mexico?

01:04.483 --> 01:07.486
- <i>Tony, what?</i>
- You said... You said yes.

01:07.620 --> 01:08.922
I thought.

01:09.189 --> 01:10.389
<i>Tony, why would you
believe anything</i>

01:10.522 --> 01:11.790
<i>anyone says on the first date?</i>

01:11.925 --> 01:13.726
Because you said you knew from
the start

01:13.860 --> 01:16.096
we were meant to be together
and we'd be together forever,

01:16.229 --> 01:18.899
so, you know, I just thought we
should take the next step.

01:19.032 --> 01:21.533
<i>I was three margaritas in</i>

01:21.667 --> 01:23.435
<i>by the time you showed up.</i>

01:23.569 --> 01:25.105
...filter over
your true emotions.

01:25.272 --> 01:26.940
<i>Tony, you don't even
have a car, how would...</i>

01:27.073 --> 01:29.009
<i>No, no, no.
It's all good. It's all good.</i>

01:29.142 --> 01:30.143
<i>I got a ride now.</i>

01:30.277 --> 01:31.677
<i>What, your grandma's car?</i>

01:31.810 --> 01:33.445
<i>No, no,
I'm borrowing my friend's car.</i>

01:33.612 --> 01:35.547
<i>I just left it at his house
and I gotta go back and get it.</i>

01:35.681 --> 01:36.950
<i>Tony...</i>

01:37.217 --> 01:38.784
Look, look, I got everything
taken care of, I swear.

01:38.919 --> 01:40.153
<i>Tony, listen,
I can't leave tonight.</i>

01:40.287 --> 01:41.922
<i>I just ordered
a really big pizza.</i>

01:42.055 --> 01:43.756
- <i>Like a really big pizza.</i>
- <i>Baby, look...</i>

01:43.890 --> 01:45.791
<i>And I really wanna eat it
fresh. It's on the way.</i>

01:45.926 --> 01:49.095
I'm kinda committed
to this whole Mexico thing.

01:49.229 --> 01:51.463
<i>Committed? What do you
mean committed?</i>

01:51.597 --> 01:53.033
<i>You told me on the first date</i>

01:53.166 --> 01:55.467
<i>that you weren't a commitment
type of guy.</i>

01:55.601 --> 01:57.003
<i>No, no, no.
It's all good.</i>

01:57.137 --> 01:58.537
<i>I don't even have
a passport.</i>

01:58.671 --> 01:59.940
<i>Do you have a passport?</i>

02:00.073 --> 02:01.241
<i>You don't need one
for Mexico.</i>

02:01.374 --> 02:02.708
He's not alone anymore.

02:02.876 --> 02:04.210
<i>Are you sure
that's how it works?</i>

02:04.344 --> 02:05.444
<i>Tasha.</i>

02:06.379 --> 02:07.780
Tasha, please.

02:07.914 --> 02:11.117
The love I feel for you is like
nothing I've ever felt.

02:11.650 --> 02:14.220
It is more warm and pure

02:14.354 --> 02:18.325
than the sand on the most
beautiful fucking Mexican beach.

02:18.457 --> 02:22.795
Just... Just come away with me.
Come away with me and I swear,

02:22.929 --> 02:26.598
I swear that you will feel the warmth
of my love for the rest of your...

02:26.732 --> 02:28.801
<i>Hang on.
My pizza's here.</i>

02:28.935 --> 02:30.136
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

02:33.472 --> 02:34.673
Are you sure he's home?

02:34.807 --> 02:36.142
Jesus Christ,
what do you mean?

02:36.376 --> 02:37.844
Of course, he's here.
What else does this idiot...

02:37.978 --> 02:39.312
There he is! There he is!
There he is!

02:42.148 --> 02:43.316
Kick it down.

02:43.450 --> 02:45.051
No, I'm not gonna kick the
fucking door down.

02:45.185 --> 02:46.987
I want the motherfucker to open
the door,

02:47.120 --> 02:49.255
invite me in,
so, I can kick his ass.

02:49.389 --> 02:51.091
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you...

02:51.224 --> 02:52.791
- Hey! Hey!
- Get out of my way.

02:52.926 --> 02:54.394
Get the fuck...

02:54.526 --> 02:56.762
- Goddamn it!
- Will you just back off?

02:56.896 --> 02:57.796
Kick it down,
you mother...

02:57.931 --> 02:59.232
I said back off!

02:59.366 --> 03:02.035
You're gonna
fucking shoot him. Wait!

03:02.534 --> 03:04.137
All up in my shit.

03:04.270 --> 03:05.438
Now back the fuck off!

03:05.571 --> 03:07.240
Gotta fucking pull a gun out

03:07.374 --> 03:09.708
all the goddamn time,
like it's your dick or something.

03:09.843 --> 03:11.177
Yes,
get the fuck away from me.

03:11.311 --> 03:12.912
It's my responsibility.

03:13.446 --> 03:15.315
<i>Hey, Tony, I'm back.</i>

03:15.748 --> 03:18.084
<i>So, I've been doing
some thinking</i>

03:18.218 --> 03:21.955
<i>and...
I think we should break up.</i>

03:23.223 --> 03:26.092
<i>I just feel like we're not on
the same page.</i>

03:26.226 --> 03:28.560
<i>Like, we live in two different
worlds, you know?</i>

03:29.195 --> 03:32.698
<i>And, like, not just Mexico
and America.</i>

03:35.567 --> 03:36.668
<i>Tony?</i>

03:38.204 --> 03:39.205
<i>Hello?</i>

03:41.007 --> 03:42.842
<i>Well, I'll just text you. Bye.</i>

04:14.507 --> 04:17.143
I don't really feel like doing
the homework.

04:17.277 --> 04:20.746
That's like 15 minutes
out of my day.

04:22.215 --> 04:23.283
I don't know.

04:24.417 --> 04:27.887
You know, I was thinking about
dropping out of math.

04:29.322 --> 04:30.924
I don't really like it.
English, too.

04:31.057 --> 04:32.992
Let's drop out of English.

04:33.126 --> 04:36.628
Actually,
I should just drop out entirely.

04:37.230 --> 04:39.532
Save the taxpayers
a couple of bucks...

04:47.806 --> 04:50.742
Mike, you might wanna watch out
for that car.

04:51.344 --> 04:52.245
Mike!

04:52.811 --> 04:53.913
Mike!

04:55.381 --> 04:56.249
Mike, watch out!

05:08.228 --> 05:08.928
Mike?

05:09.062 --> 05:10.796
Kelsey, hi, how you doing?

05:10.930 --> 05:12.098
Are you okay?

05:12.631 --> 05:14.800
Whoa. You all right, buddy?
You know, you gotta watch out,

05:14.934 --> 05:17.036
it's a blind corner right here.

05:17.170 --> 05:19.272
You good?
Yeah, I'm good.

05:19.405 --> 05:21.975
You're good, brother.
Yo, Kelsey.

05:22.408 --> 05:23.877
Chet.

05:24.344 --> 05:25.777
I imagine a busy girl like
yourself doesn't have too much time

05:25.912 --> 05:27.746
to prep for the calc final,
am I right?

05:27.881 --> 05:29.115
Well,
pointless chit chat with you

05:29.315 --> 05:30.816
does kinda eat away
at my free time.

05:31.017 --> 05:33.652
Let's study together.
Just name a day.

05:34.786 --> 05:36.422
Sure, why not.

05:36.556 --> 05:39.658
How about the second Tuesday
of next week.

05:44.864 --> 05:46.065
What day is that?

05:46.199 --> 05:48.700
Oh, it's the 15th... of never.

05:48.835 --> 05:50.069
Is there two Tuesdays
next week?

05:50.203 --> 05:51.871
Hey, Kelsey, for real though.

05:52.005 --> 05:54.040
Hey, if you need a study buddy
let me...

05:55.508 --> 05:57.443
I'll break her eventually.

05:57.577 --> 05:59.279
Yeah, you'll break her
eventually.

06:01.514 --> 06:04.050
- Cute ride.
- Cute ride, bro.

06:04.683 --> 06:09.122
I'm hungry.
Fuck, let's go.

06:23.136 --> 06:26.506
Dude, your mom makes bomb
chimichangas.

06:26.639 --> 06:27.974
That's not the last one is it?

06:28.107 --> 06:30.009
No, there should be some more
out there.

06:36.849 --> 06:38.084
So...

06:38.717 --> 06:40.119
when are you gonna ask her out?

06:40.386 --> 06:41.820
Uh... What?

06:42.222 --> 06:44.190
When are you going to
ask her out?

06:44.524 --> 06:47.594
I mean, her names your freaking
email password, fuck's sake.

06:47.726 --> 06:49.128
Why do you know my email...

06:49.262 --> 06:50.930
Don't worry about semantics.

06:51.164 --> 06:54.567
Listen, pick up your phone,
call her, get a date with her.

06:54.766 --> 06:56.236
I... I don't,
I don't have her number.

06:56.369 --> 06:57.337
It's cool, I do.

06:57.470 --> 06:58.972
Wait,
how do you have her number?

06:59.105 --> 07:00.406
Stole Janice's phone in bio.

07:01.107 --> 07:02.475
You stole Janice's phone?

07:02.609 --> 07:04.544
- Yeah. We worked it out.
- That's just not...

07:04.677 --> 07:06.179
We're going on a date tonight.

07:09.015 --> 07:10.883
Let's go, Mike, chop chop.

07:15.754 --> 07:16.889
I lost my phone.

07:17.123 --> 07:19.025
Underneath your clothes,
by the desk.

07:21.127 --> 07:23.696
- How did you know it...
- They got an app for that.

07:23.830 --> 07:25.164
Dude, why are you tracking my...

07:25.298 --> 07:26.866
'Cause you lose
everything you touch.

07:27.033 --> 07:29.469
You'd lose your ball sack if it
wasn't attached to you.

07:29.602 --> 07:32.872
Look, you're still not doing
what I told you.

07:33.006 --> 07:35.508
Call her, it's not hard.
Let's go step by step.

07:35.942 --> 07:39.145
Dial 555-1138.

07:39.279 --> 07:41.114
You're gonna press call,
you're gonna take the phone

07:41.247 --> 07:44.350
up to your ear, it's gonna ring
once, twice, three times.

07:44.484 --> 07:45.551
Don't be alarmed.

07:45.685 --> 07:47.153
She might just be getting out of
the shower,

07:47.287 --> 07:49.889
about to wrap that towel around
her upper body,

07:50.023 --> 07:51.991
and then she's gonna pick up on
the fourth ring.

07:52.125 --> 07:54.894
Mike, I don't have all day.

07:56.629 --> 07:59.165
On that fourth ring,
you get to talk to her.

07:59.299 --> 08:00.767
But if it goes on
for a fifth ring,

08:00.900 --> 08:03.202
then she might not pick up,
'cause on the sixth ring

08:03.336 --> 08:05.705
it clicks dead,
but I wouldn't worry about that

08:05.838 --> 08:06.706
if I were you.

08:18.184 --> 08:19.319
<i>Hello?</i>

08:19.452 --> 08:21.454
Go, go, go.
Pick it up.

08:21.587 --> 08:23.189
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, Kelsey...

08:23.323 --> 08:24.924
No, I'm not interested in buying
industrial strength

08:25.058 --> 08:26.359
commercial size garbage bags.

08:26.492 --> 08:28.528
- <i>Thanks. Stop calling.</i>
- Oh, no, no, no.

08:28.661 --> 08:31.597
It's Mike. Mike from school.

08:32.532 --> 08:33.433
Mike?

08:33.566 --> 08:34.901
Yup.

08:35.068 --> 08:36.469
<i>Hey I didn't realize you
had my number.</i>

08:36.602 --> 08:38.237
- Give it to me...
- I can't lie to you.

08:38.371 --> 08:39.906
Brett stole your phone number
from Janice's phone.

08:40.039 --> 08:41.307
<i>Oh, my fucking God.</i>
Hey, Donna...

08:41.441 --> 08:43.609
have you seen your son's
ball sack anywhere?

08:43.776 --> 08:45.578
Did you just yell "ball sack"?

08:45.712 --> 08:47.780
- No, no, no.
- I swear I just heard "ball sack."

08:47.914 --> 08:48.815
It was Brett.

08:48.948 --> 08:50.249
Brett has your ball sack?

08:50.383 --> 08:52.051
No, he was saying if my mom seen
my ball sack.

08:52.185 --> 08:54.420
Your ball sack or his ball?
I'm confused.

08:54.554 --> 08:56.956
It was a metaphor. Uh...

08:59.692 --> 09:01.894
Yeah, that's a...
that's a problem.

09:02.495 --> 09:04.764
<i>Okay, look, just think back.</i>

09:04.897 --> 09:06.132
Let's retrace your steps.

09:06.265 --> 09:10.236
Where do you feel
like you last felt them?

09:11.904 --> 09:13.473
I... I... I...

09:13.973 --> 09:15.408
Tell me you found them.

09:17.577 --> 09:18.578
Yup.

09:18.711 --> 09:19.779
That was a close call.

09:20.146 --> 09:21.581
I have my balls.

09:23.816 --> 09:27.420
- So, is that why you called?
- No, no. Uh...

09:28.020 --> 09:29.389
I, um...

09:36.229 --> 09:38.030
I like your music.

09:38.898 --> 09:41.768
It's Jackson and Jackie.

09:42.201 --> 09:44.203
Here, listen.

09:55.581 --> 09:57.517
It's an eight-track player,
by the way.

09:57.650 --> 09:58.751
Eight-track?

09:58.886 --> 10:00.286
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:00.620 --> 10:03.022
Yeah, I actually pulled it out
of the dumpster this morning.

10:03.156 --> 10:04.357
Secretly.

10:04.924 --> 10:06.092
Why secretly?

10:06.860 --> 10:12.231
Well, uh, my mom threw it away,
and when she throws things away

10:12.365 --> 10:14.367
she never
wants to see them again.

10:15.401 --> 10:18.104
She threw out
a bunch of old stuff, actually.

10:18.237 --> 10:22.141
There's a VHS player
with a tape inside.

10:22.275 --> 10:23.877
Oh, which... which, uh, tape?

10:24.010 --> 10:25.945
<i>Titanic,</i> tape one.

10:29.215 --> 10:31.117
Seriously, I mean,
how have we not talked

10:31.250 --> 10:34.454
since, like, what, eighth grade?

10:35.788 --> 10:37.557
I don't know, uh...

10:38.057 --> 10:39.659
<i>Kelsey!</i>

10:39.792 --> 10:41.694
<i>Where the hell are you?
Get in here.</i>

10:41.829 --> 10:45.998
<i>I wanted this kitchen clean.
This floor does not look clean.</i>

10:46.132 --> 10:47.300
<i>How did I get stuck
with a kid...</i>

10:47.600 --> 10:49.669
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

10:49.802 --> 10:52.538
Hey, Mike, I gotta go.

10:52.672 --> 10:53.874
- <i>Kelsey!</i>
- Sorry.

10:54.006 --> 10:55.741
Oh, yeah, no... no problem.

10:58.344 --> 11:01.481
Do you... Are you busy later?

11:02.081 --> 11:03.951
Uh... No.

11:04.083 --> 11:05.218
No plans.

11:05.351 --> 11:07.019
Do you want to hang out?

11:09.555 --> 11:10.590
Yeah.

11:11.824 --> 11:12.960
Yeah.

11:13.092 --> 11:14.828
Pick me up at seven?

11:14.962 --> 11:16.128
Yeah. Cool, I can do that.

11:16.262 --> 11:18.130
Cool, I'll see you tonight.

11:19.065 --> 11:20.566
See... See you tonight.

11:21.234 --> 11:22.502
<i>Kelsey!</i>

11:22.635 --> 11:24.036
<i>Who the hell are you
talking to?</i>

11:24.170 --> 11:25.771
<i>Get off the phone...</i>

11:25.906 --> 11:27.273
"See you tonight"?

11:27.406 --> 11:29.408
You're seeing her tonight?

11:29.542 --> 11:31.077
I'm seeing her tonight, dude.

11:31.244 --> 11:32.645
- You picking her up?
- Yeah.

11:32.778 --> 11:34.347
What car are you gonna use,
the invisible one?

11:34.480 --> 11:36.082
- I'll just drive the van.
- Big back seat, nice.

11:36.516 --> 11:38.251
- Except one problem.
- What?

11:38.384 --> 11:39.785
Your parents are leaving for
Vegas.

11:39.920 --> 11:40.921
No.

11:41.287 --> 11:42.755
There's food in the fridge.
All right?

11:42.956 --> 11:44.056
You know what, Brett ate your
last chimichanga, though.

11:44.190 --> 11:45.658
I'm sorry. Have fun.

11:45.791 --> 11:47.360
- There's beer in the refrigerator.
- Mm-hm.

11:47.527 --> 11:48.160
If you want to have a party,
I'm okay with that.

11:48.294 --> 11:49.462
But I'm...

11:50.229 --> 11:51.664
I do not want any feet on my coffee table.
That's my one rule, okay?

11:51.797 --> 11:53.165
I just...
I needed to borrow the car,

11:53.299 --> 11:55.601
'cause I have...
I have a date.

11:55.735 --> 11:57.069
You have a date?

11:57.203 --> 11:58.839
- Michael!
- My man.

11:58.972 --> 12:00.506
- That is great.
- Good for you.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.241
You know what,
there's condoms upstairs

12:02.775 --> 12:04.243
on your dads bedside table,
so if you need to use 'em, get to it.

12:04.377 --> 12:05.879
Hey, we don't want
to become grandparents.

12:06.013 --> 12:07.014
We sure don't, all right?

12:07.146 --> 12:08.047
- But...
- You take care.

12:08.180 --> 12:09.016
Have fun, baby.

12:17.323 --> 12:19.492
Well, date's off.

12:20.928 --> 12:24.096
No, it's not, dude.
You give up too quick. Check it.

12:29.937 --> 12:31.939
Plain paint job, nice rims.

12:32.071 --> 12:33.239
Got a working AC.

12:33.372 --> 12:35.976
Not bad looking
for a starter car.

12:36.676 --> 12:39.245
You can swing, uh, three grand,
right?

12:43.884 --> 12:47.988
Can you just like stop being you
for like two seconds?

12:48.120 --> 12:49.589
Is that doable, maybe?

12:51.223 --> 12:53.159
I only have 2,700.

12:53.326 --> 12:54.427
Uh... Check your dad's
condom drawer.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.596
I think he has some cash
in there.

12:57.296 --> 12:58.598
- What?
- Dude.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.099
I have a date tonight.

13:00.533 --> 13:02.702
I can't steal from my parents.

13:02.836 --> 13:04.071
It's not stealing.

13:04.503 --> 13:06.073
It's borrowing, and our whole
economy's built off that.

13:06.205 --> 13:08.441
And... sent.

13:08.842 --> 13:11.310
Some guy named Dennis expects
you in the morning,

13:11.444 --> 13:14.881
or nowish, I don't know,
I told him "some time."

13:15.015 --> 13:16.248
Are you ready to own a vehicle?

13:16.382 --> 13:18.150
Are you ready to be
better than Chet?

13:18.284 --> 13:19.685
Well, not better,
he's better looking,

13:19.819 --> 13:22.388
has a better car,
and is probably gonna end up

13:22.521 --> 13:25.257
taking your girl out,
wining, dining, 69-ing.

13:25.391 --> 13:27.793
That's how my dad met my mom.

13:28.996 --> 13:30.329
Are you my dad?

13:30.496 --> 13:32.465
Or are you the guy
that could have been my dad?

14:09.669 --> 14:12.171
- Hi there.
- Uh... Hi.

14:12.805 --> 14:13.806
How's it going?

14:14.007 --> 14:15.307
Good, good.

14:19.545 --> 14:20.981
- That's mine.
- Oh, uh...

14:21.114 --> 14:22.049
- Yeah.
- You, uh...

14:22.181 --> 14:23.349
Mike? Mike!

14:23.482 --> 14:24.817
Yo, hey, Mike.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.786
Mikey, how you doing?
I just got your email.

14:26.987 --> 14:29.622
Something with my modem.
I have to keep rebooting it.

14:29.755 --> 14:31.424
You know how these freaking
cable companies are.

14:31.624 --> 14:33.559
Yeah, it's Dennis, man, Dennis.
How you doing?

14:33.693 --> 14:35.361
You must have been
on the way when I sent back.

14:35.494 --> 14:37.164
What about the car?
Where is she taking the car?

14:37.296 --> 14:38.832
I just sold that one.

14:39.198 --> 14:40.633
Signed, sealed, delivered.

14:40.766 --> 14:42.401
But I got three more cars out
here for you to see.

14:42.535 --> 14:43.669
You're absolutely gonna love
'em.

14:44.905 --> 14:46.272
Come on in,
make yourself at home.

14:46.405 --> 14:47.640
Look out for the cats.

14:47.773 --> 14:49.275
They're everywhere,
but they're fine.

14:49.408 --> 14:51.144
You want a beer or something?

14:51.277 --> 14:53.080
I'm fine. Thanks, though.

14:53.212 --> 14:55.281
How 'bout a burrito?
Dude, they're great with mustard.

14:55.414 --> 14:57.316
Some homeless turned me on to them one day.
He's out front eating it,

14:57.450 --> 14:58.885
and I said,
"Hey, what are you eating?"

14:59.019 --> 15:00.453
He says, "A burrito.
It's really good with mustard.

15:00.586 --> 15:01.754
You want a bite?"

15:02.122 --> 15:03.622
I said, "Well, what the hell,
I'm adventurous."

15:03.756 --> 15:05.125
I tried it, I went in
and bought a dozen.

15:05.257 --> 15:06.927
I'm telling you,
they're fantastic.

15:07.060 --> 15:09.361
Like the chicken myself.
They're awesome, man.

15:09.930 --> 15:10.997
So, uh...

15:12.298 --> 15:13.499
Mr. Dennis.

15:13.666 --> 15:15.234
Yo, what kid?
I got a bum ear.

15:15.634 --> 15:17.204
Just the car.
I just wanted to know...

15:17.603 --> 15:20.272
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got two cars
outside you're absolutely gonna love.

15:20.406 --> 15:22.341
Fine automobiles,
right up your alley.

15:22.475 --> 15:23.776
Don't worry about it.

15:26.245 --> 15:27.580
Say, you looking for
a watch upgrade?

15:27.813 --> 15:29.482
- Uh...
- They're really good man.

15:29.615 --> 15:31.218
Chinese construction,
Swiss movement.

15:31.350 --> 15:32.919
- I'm good, I'm good.
- How 'bout a necklace? 28 karat gold.

15:33.053 --> 15:34.353
Show your old lady
how much you love her.

15:34.487 --> 15:35.889
Uh... Thanks, but no thanks.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.823
Watch out. Your feet.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.559
It's got a bad motivator.
Kinda got a mind of its own now.

15:40.693 --> 15:42.963
It wound up in the backyard
last week.

15:47.934 --> 15:50.736
Hey, uh, Dennis...
Hey, thanks for everything,

15:50.871 --> 15:53.173
but I really...
I gotta get going.

15:53.572 --> 15:54.841
Whoa, whoa, whoa, kid.
Don't worry.

15:54.975 --> 15:56.442
I got a car out here you're
gonna love.

15:56.675 --> 15:58.677
Come on, come on.
Let me show it to you, let's go.

16:01.248 --> 16:04.650
No finer car out here.
2,995.

16:07.254 --> 16:08.487
Um...

16:09.288 --> 16:11.091
Thanks and all.

16:11.224 --> 16:13.359
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't go
anywhere without test driving it.

16:13.692 --> 16:15.962
Come on, kid, we'll take it for
a little spin.

16:23.170 --> 16:24.503
She's just warming up.

16:25.404 --> 16:27.274
She's calling your name, Mike.
Come on.

16:27.406 --> 16:29.809
Come on, don't be shy.
Have a look.

16:30.877 --> 16:32.812
Come on in, kid.
Come on, come on.

16:33.679 --> 16:35.081
What the fuck is this?

16:40.519 --> 16:42.055
Go on, put your foot in it.

16:43.190 --> 16:44.557
Feel that?

16:44.723 --> 16:47.593
That's 440 cubic inches under
your right foot, baby.

16:47.726 --> 16:48.862
She's got power to spare.

16:48.995 --> 16:50.663
This thing runs
like a scalded dog.

16:51.097 --> 16:54.767
Two-and-half tons of fine
American steel surrounding ya.

16:54.901 --> 16:57.536
Who needs airbags when you got
that kind of security?

16:57.670 --> 16:59.172
This is when they made 'em
solid and stout.

16:59.306 --> 17:01.707
Baby, you hit something in this,
you don't need an airbag,

17:01.842 --> 17:03.475
because they're gonna know it,
you're not.

17:03.609 --> 17:04.643
You're gonna keep
flying down the road.

17:04.777 --> 17:06.279
And I know what you're thinking.

17:06.412 --> 17:08.414
The paints kinda faded
and the chromes not so bright,

17:08.547 --> 17:10.016
but you don't want to
blind people,

17:10.416 --> 17:12.685
you want to catch their eye.
You want to keep 'em glued to it.

17:12.818 --> 17:15.788
This car right here will do it
and the room.

17:15.989 --> 17:17.090
Can you feel it?

17:17.224 --> 17:19.226
It's like the great outdoors
with leather.

17:19.491 --> 17:20.961
This is Mikey's world
right here.

17:21.094 --> 17:24.563
This is your universe
on four tires, baby.

17:24.697 --> 17:27.399
Speaking of universe, look way out
there in the end of the galaxy.

17:27.533 --> 17:31.171
You're not gonna find more room in a
backseat, if you know what I mean, right?

17:31.570 --> 17:34.040
I got collectors
from here to Missouri

17:34.174 --> 17:37.978
kicking down my door, begging me
to sell 'em this car.

17:38.912 --> 17:39.913
Is...

17:40.080 --> 17:41.147
What do you say?

17:41.281 --> 17:42.781
...that an eight-track player?

17:42.949 --> 17:46.152
What? Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, you got a good eye kid.

17:46.286 --> 17:47.954
Yeah, this the latest and
greatest in high fidelity.

17:48.088 --> 17:50.623
It's like the vinyl
of car audio.

17:50.756 --> 17:53.626
You know, as a matter of fact...

17:53.759 --> 17:57.063
I'll even throw in some tapes.

18:45.045 --> 18:45.946
Hey!

19:28.254 --> 19:31.091
My condolences.
You doing all right, hon?

19:31.358 --> 19:33.259
Um... Yeah. Why?

19:33.692 --> 19:34.928
Well clearly your grandpa
just died

19:35.095 --> 19:38.497
and he left you this very sturdy
automobile here.

19:40.066 --> 19:41.167
Um...

19:41.301 --> 19:43.003
Or is that not how you came to
be in possession

19:43.136 --> 19:45.472
- of this car, young man?
- No, no, I just bought it.

19:45.604 --> 19:47.073
I just got it.

19:47.474 --> 19:48.741
Funny.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.878
Thought a kid like him
would get himself

19:52.012 --> 19:56.850
some sort of... neon green
piece of shit sedan...

19:58.351 --> 19:59.718
with spinning rims.

20:00.719 --> 20:02.889
But voluntarily purchasing
himself...

20:03.655 --> 20:05.258
- What is this?
- Chrysler, New Yorker.

20:05.392 --> 20:09.295
A Chrysler New Yorker
that got crapped out by 1966.

20:09.429 --> 20:11.231
Mm. It is a '65.

20:12.165 --> 20:13.933
A 1965.

20:16.202 --> 20:18.972
That just don't sound like sober
decision making to me, Davis.

20:19.105 --> 20:20.473
We been doing
any drinking today?

20:20.606 --> 20:22.008
Uh... No, nope.

20:22.674 --> 20:24.244
Any drug use?

20:24.377 --> 20:25.278
No.

20:26.046 --> 20:28.214
Marijuana?
Because that does qualify.

20:28.348 --> 20:30.083
I don't... I don't smoke.

20:30.884 --> 20:32.452
Texting while driving.

20:32.584 --> 20:33.819
No, see, I was just trying to...

20:33.953 --> 20:36.189
Let me just take a look at your
phone, please.

20:36.822 --> 20:38.124
Thank you.

20:42.829 --> 20:44.330
We're also gonna need license,
registration,

20:44.464 --> 20:46.399
- and proof of insurance.
- Yeah. Um...

20:46.533 --> 20:49.335
6:42 p.m., looks like
Brett sent you a sext.

20:49.469 --> 20:50.736
Yeah...

20:57.510 --> 20:58.811
Registration, too.

20:59.479 --> 21:00.980
And proof of insurance.

21:01.414 --> 21:02.415
Oh yeah, I don't have it yet.

21:02.549 --> 21:04.484
I just... I just bought the car.

21:04.616 --> 21:07.187
But there is a registration card
in this vehicle, right?

21:07.653 --> 21:09.721
Registered by the previous
owner.

21:09.889 --> 21:11.424
Who is Kelsey?

21:11.558 --> 21:14.828
Oh, um, Kelsey she's just
probably wondering where I am,

21:14.961 --> 21:17.530
'cause...
...we have a date.

21:17.663 --> 21:19.365
- Sorry?
- Just taking her out on a date.

21:19.499 --> 21:21.868
- Oh, here you go.
- Don't let him answer that.

21:30.276 --> 21:32.011
Mr. Duchovny, sir.

21:36.715 --> 21:38.284
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

21:38.418 --> 21:40.053
There's a thing called a GPS
now. Have you tried it before?

21:40.186 --> 21:42.355
Just, uh,
gotta run a few errands.

21:42.489 --> 21:45.525
I'll be there around eight,
if that's cool?

21:45.657 --> 21:47.026
Yeah, no problem.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.095
- I'll see you then.
- <i>You better.</i>

21:53.600 --> 21:54.934
<i>So, um...</i>

21:55.935 --> 21:59.339
Your running errands
on date night, huh?

22:04.643 --> 22:05.912
Uh-huh.

22:06.045 --> 22:08.780
- I gotta go get some, uh...
- Condoms.

22:09.715 --> 22:11.084
Yeah.

22:11.985 --> 22:13.853
- Yeah.
- Good boy.

22:23.463 --> 22:24.796
Great.

22:36.009 --> 22:38.344
Hey, uh, Dennis, I, um...

22:38.845 --> 22:40.113
This stuff was in the car.

22:40.246 --> 22:42.115
I think you left it
in the glove box.

22:43.116 --> 22:44.017
Dennis?

23:04.470 --> 23:06.005
Uh... Dennis?

23:10.543 --> 23:12.045
Hey, Dennis?

23:18.117 --> 23:18.817
Mm.

23:19.485 --> 23:22.322
This is not what it looks like
at all.

23:22.455 --> 23:23.623
Dennis.

23:23.822 --> 23:24.958
I bought a car from here,
from Dennis

23:25.258 --> 23:26.758
and I found this in
the glove compartment,

23:26.893 --> 23:27.961
I just wanted to return it.

23:28.094 --> 23:29.696
Hey!

23:29.829 --> 23:32.065
No, please!

23:32.198 --> 23:34.167
Damn, lady. I'm sorry.

23:35.902 --> 23:37.003
Where's my husband?

23:37.270 --> 23:40.173
I didn't...

23:58.191 --> 24:00.293
Come on.
Just get it together.

24:03.363 --> 24:04.364
Shut up.

24:06.065 --> 24:08.735
Just gotta get it...
Just pull it.

24:28.855 --> 24:30.123
I'm gonna shoot you anyway,

24:30.523 --> 24:32.824
so you might as well just come
out and get it over with.

24:39.132 --> 24:41.167
Where's my husband?

24:42.335 --> 24:47.073
Where is he?

24:51.344 --> 24:52.245
Hey!

24:56.049 --> 24:59.285
- Oh, God.
- Hey! Get back here!

25:00.386 --> 25:01.521
Whoa!

25:16.035 --> 25:18.404
All right,
let's just back up here.

25:18.538 --> 25:21.140
The vacuum cleaner got out on
the sidewalk how?

25:21.274 --> 25:23.276
Um... I don't know.

25:23.409 --> 25:25.578
I don't want your help.

25:25.712 --> 25:26.913
I don't want your help!

25:27.347 --> 25:30.283
Just get out of my house!
Just get out of my house!

25:30.416 --> 25:31.584
Just get out!

25:32.118 --> 25:33.386
Get out.

25:34.887 --> 25:36.022
I'm not a criminal.

25:36.155 --> 25:37.724
What did I do?
I didn't do anything.

25:37.857 --> 25:39.158
Oh, yeah?

25:43.596 --> 25:45.131
Don't answer that.

25:53.906 --> 25:55.274
Kelsey!

25:55.408 --> 25:56.442
Dinner.

26:02.181 --> 26:03.916
Yo, Kelsey.

26:04.050 --> 26:05.618
Shouldn't you be studying it up?

26:06.686 --> 26:10.490
Kelsey, are you eating
or going out?

26:17.029 --> 26:18.531
Michael,
thanks for calling us in

26:18.664 --> 26:21.334
about knock on the noggin,
we really appreciate it,

26:21.467 --> 26:23.069
but I can't help but wonder

26:23.202 --> 26:26.005
why were you even here
in the first place?

26:26.139 --> 26:27.940
I bought a car from Dennis.

26:28.074 --> 26:30.676
Here's the paperwork right here,
actually. My...

26:30.810 --> 26:33.513
You were meant to be out
romancing with Kelsey, right?

26:34.480 --> 26:35.381
I...

26:37.183 --> 26:41.354
I left my watch
and actually speaking of time,

26:41.487 --> 26:43.656
- I do have to get going...
- If you don't take off your watch

26:43.790 --> 26:45.958
and leave it at a complete
stranger's house,

26:46.092 --> 26:48.327
you wouldn't be late.
Right?

26:48.461 --> 26:50.062
I don't know how true that is.

26:50.196 --> 26:51.964
Seeing as he hasn't taken off
his watch in two years

26:52.098 --> 26:53.499
and he's still late.

26:55.201 --> 26:57.270
I told you
I'd make it up to you.

26:58.037 --> 26:59.372
Oh, yes, you will.

27:01.307 --> 27:03.409
Who cares
about a freaking watch?

27:03.543 --> 27:06.646
I want to know who went
to my house and took my husband?

27:06.779 --> 27:08.581
Honey, we want those
answers the same as you

27:08.714 --> 27:10.650
but we gotta come at this from
every angle, right?

27:10.783 --> 27:13.854
'Cause your husband has got
himself a record,

27:13.986 --> 27:15.221
and you know that.

27:16.022 --> 27:20.293
Michael, let's talk turkey.
Got ourselves a missing person.

27:20.894 --> 27:22.028
Got a burglary.

27:22.628 --> 27:24.764
And we got you...
here at the scene.

27:24.898 --> 27:26.999
I didn't, I didn't take
anything. I swear, I didn't.

27:27.133 --> 27:28.501
You can check my car.

27:28.634 --> 27:31.737
Okay, did you see anything
of any value in here

27:31.872 --> 27:34.173
that maybe someone else would of
broken in for?

27:36.809 --> 27:38.010
Anything.

27:39.947 --> 27:42.248
Nothing out of the ordinary, no.

27:42.381 --> 27:43.349
No?

27:45.618 --> 27:46.619
Okay.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.588
Is it okay if I leave though?

27:48.721 --> 27:50.690
Yes, you're late.

27:50.823 --> 27:52.492
- Michael.
- Yes?

27:52.625 --> 27:54.427
You might want your phone.

27:54.994 --> 27:56.195
Thank you.

27:58.531 --> 28:01.467
Don't worry about it.
Go on, get out of here.

28:02.068 --> 28:03.603
Would you get that?

28:20.453 --> 28:21.787
So, Darla.

28:23.289 --> 28:24.790
How do you know Tony?

28:34.667 --> 28:37.436
- Missed a spot.
- Oh.

28:39.605 --> 28:41.774
So, uh, you change your mind on
that study sesh?

28:41.909 --> 28:43.576
Nope, taking out the trash.

28:45.946 --> 28:47.981
Go on, that's your cue.

28:48.114 --> 28:49.382
What?

28:53.553 --> 28:55.655
I got it.
That's funny.

28:55.788 --> 28:58.424
I'm good for a joke.
Not much else.

29:01.060 --> 29:03.329
- Something wrong?
- No, fine.

29:04.196 --> 29:05.698
You seem a little down.

29:06.198 --> 29:07.300
Do I?

29:11.470 --> 29:13.806
You know if you ever need
to get anything off your chest,

29:13.941 --> 29:15.008
I'm your guy, right?

29:15.909 --> 29:18.077
Something that I actually
really love.

29:18.210 --> 29:20.279
You know,
being the sympathetic ear

29:20.413 --> 29:21.514
for those who need it.

29:21.647 --> 29:23.850
That must be a really hard life.

29:23.984 --> 29:27.553
Being permanently attached to
the side of somebody's head.

29:27.687 --> 29:29.155
I mean, how do you deal
with the earwax?

29:29.422 --> 29:31.892
Do you, like, penetrate yourself
with a really big Q-tip?

29:32.025 --> 29:34.393
Are you seriously judging me
based on my appearance?

29:34.760 --> 29:37.965
Why can't a good looking,
tri sport athlete

29:38.097 --> 29:41.267
love being the person who
shows up for a friend

29:41.400 --> 29:42.735
when they need it?

29:54.014 --> 29:55.314
All right, Chet.

29:57.416 --> 29:58.718
Let's go for a ride.

30:00.686 --> 30:03.356
Or should I leave you two alone?

30:27.613 --> 30:30.683
Mike, money, check it out.

30:31.183 --> 30:32.518
It's a secret.

30:33.954 --> 30:36.756
No, we're not joining.
Don't get the pamphlets.

30:36.890 --> 30:39.625
Mrs. Madison,
I'm here to pick up Kelsey.

30:41.327 --> 30:42.595
Oh.

30:42.795 --> 30:43.763
I see.

30:43.997 --> 30:45.398
So you're the asshole
that stood her up?

30:45.631 --> 30:46.499
Look...

30:46.632 --> 30:48.534
- Earl.
- Yeah, yeah.

30:48.668 --> 30:50.636
- Look who's here.
- What's up, dear? What?

30:50.937 --> 30:53.907
- Look who's here.
- Yeah, what do you want?

30:54.107 --> 30:55.441
Just looking for...

30:55.574 --> 30:57.077
Come on, spit it out, kid.
What do you want?

30:57.209 --> 30:59.445
I'm really sorry I'm late,
but I ran into an emergency,

30:59.578 --> 31:02.581
and I promise
I can make it up to her.

31:02.715 --> 31:04.350
Yeah, yeah.
What? Make it up to her?

31:04.517 --> 31:05.852
What does that mean?

31:08.487 --> 31:11.424
I... I just wanted to talk her.
Is it okay if I talk to her right now?

31:11.557 --> 31:12.959
- Like really quickly.
- No.

31:13.693 --> 31:16.295
She left with that neighbor kid.

31:18.564 --> 31:20.167
Is that your heap
on the driveway?

31:20.299 --> 31:25.438
Oh look at that piece of...
Wait, is that a '61 Impala?

31:25.571 --> 31:26.973
What a piece of crap.

31:27.107 --> 31:28.541
No, wait.

31:36.917 --> 31:39.285
<i>Okay, so he shoots Lenny
and then the story ends.</i>

31:40.352 --> 31:42.856
<i>Since we're just sitting
around here waiting for shit.</i>

31:42.989 --> 31:44.891
<i>Might as well talk about
why he does that.</i>

31:45.192 --> 31:47.626
- <i>What are you looking at me for?</i>
- <i>You know why.</i>

31:47.760 --> 31:50.663
- <i>Shut the fuck up!</i>
- <i>Let's talk about the fucking books...</i>

31:51.064 --> 31:52.765
<i>Titanic</i> on VHS.

31:56.402 --> 31:57.570
It's got two tapes.

31:58.171 --> 32:00.639
<i>I don't want you
to think that...</i>

32:01.307 --> 32:03.076
Wonder where the VCR is.

32:03.409 --> 32:05.377
That's what they do. The put a
fucking bullet in the back of the head.

32:05.511 --> 32:07.480
So what, he's too lazy to
take care of a sick pet?

32:07.613 --> 32:08.849
What?
Is that what you're saying?

32:08.982 --> 32:10.449
No, no. This has
nothing to do with that.

32:10.583 --> 32:12.585
Yes, it does.
Yes it fucking does.

32:12.718 --> 32:13.987
All right,
George was too afraid.

32:14.121 --> 32:15.755
He was too afraid to take care
of Lenny.

32:15.889 --> 32:17.590
He's too afraid
to fucking man up,

32:17.723 --> 32:20.326
put some hair on his fucking
chest, and take the fall.

32:20.459 --> 32:21.928
He takes the easy way out.

32:22.062 --> 32:23.462
That is not true!

32:23.596 --> 32:25.132
Yes, it is.
It's right there in the book.

32:25.264 --> 32:27.433
- He's fucking selfish.
- It was a mercy killing.

32:27.566 --> 32:28.902
It wasn't
a fucking mercy killing.

32:29.035 --> 32:30.603
George was covering
for his fucking self.

32:30.736 --> 32:31.938
Covering for himself
for what?

32:32.072 --> 32:33.439
In what world
did he commit a crime?

32:33.572 --> 32:35.108
Oh, my God,
did you miss the part

32:35.242 --> 32:37.443
where George does nothing while
Lenny murders Curley's wife?

32:37.576 --> 32:39.345
It wasn't murder.
He's an idiot.

32:39.478 --> 32:42.115
- How is he responsible...
- He's actually mentally disabled.

32:42.249 --> 32:45.018
- Shut up!
- See, even he gets it. Asshole.

32:45.152 --> 32:46.920
What the fuck?
Is this the fucking PC police?

32:47.053 --> 32:49.189
You know if your one job
is to keep an eye one someone

32:49.321 --> 32:51.323
that's not all there, then you lock
that shit down. You don't fuck around

32:51.457 --> 32:53.526
- with that shit.
- What do you know about caring about anybody?

32:53.659 --> 32:56.263
Oh, you've no fucking idea and an
idiot is totally fucking different.

32:56.395 --> 32:57.563
How so, Ricky?

32:57.696 --> 32:59.698
Textbook example.

32:59.833 --> 33:01.300
Hey, Ricky, you wanna watch
<i>Titanic?</i>

33:01.433 --> 33:03.036
Shut up.
You know, Vince,

33:03.170 --> 33:05.738
you've got zero awareness
of how you effect other people,

33:05.872 --> 33:07.473
- you know that?
- It's a romance.

33:07.706 --> 33:09.843
With your fucking words,
with your fucking actions.

33:09.976 --> 33:11.811
You just fly in like a big
fucking wrecking ball

33:11.945 --> 33:13.847
and you smash up
everybody's shit

33:14.014 --> 33:16.216
with no fucking regard.
And you know, I'm getting sick and tired

33:16.348 --> 33:18.818
- of having to hold you accountable...
- Donnie!

33:18.952 --> 33:21.687
Why the fuck are your feet on
the coffee table?

33:26.725 --> 33:28.594
No, you don't come into
somebody's home

33:28.727 --> 33:32.398
and disrespect the home by putting
your fucking feet on the coffee table.

33:32.531 --> 33:35.668
- You literally broke into this house.
- It's common courtesy 101.

33:35.801 --> 33:37.636
That is where people eat.

33:37.770 --> 33:39.039
People don't eat
on coffee tables.

33:39.172 --> 33:41.574
But people don't eat off it.
They just...

33:41.707 --> 33:44.211
Do you like the taste of your
own shit in your coffee?

33:44.677 --> 33:46.779
- You don't even drink coffee.
- Huh?

33:48.849 --> 33:49.850
No.

33:49.983 --> 33:51.684
When I pull my foot
out of your ass,

33:51.817 --> 33:54.287
I'm gonna wipe my shoe all over
the fucking coffee table,

33:54.420 --> 33:56.156
then you can taste
all the bullshit,

33:56.289 --> 33:58.024
shitty-ass, fucked up coffee
that you want

33:58.158 --> 34:00.492
and stop sucking face in front
of everybody,

34:00.626 --> 34:02.095
it's fucking disgusting!

34:02.229 --> 34:03.964
Get involved in this
goddamn book club,

34:04.097 --> 34:07.267
or I'm gonna fucking start
killing people, God damn it!

34:07.399 --> 34:09.102
Do I have to start
smoking inside?

34:15.842 --> 34:16.775
Huh?

34:17.476 --> 34:20.881
'Cause every time I step
outside, for my smoke break,

34:21.814 --> 34:24.951
you know, as an act
of courtesy to you all,

34:25.784 --> 34:29.655
when I come back in, everything
has gone to shit.

34:31.590 --> 34:33.126
So, maybe, I need to make you

34:33.260 --> 34:37.063
start inhaling my fucking
second-hand smoke.

34:37.663 --> 34:39.632
You make them inhale your
second-hand smoke, huh?

34:39.765 --> 34:43.003
Just for the 2,000th
fucking time...

34:44.603 --> 34:47.941
just... tolerate each other

34:48.540 --> 34:51.477
and then you can all go home,

34:51.610 --> 34:55.781
and... we never have to
see each other again.

34:59.418 --> 35:00.887
What about book club?

35:08.194 --> 35:09.095
Please.

35:12.165 --> 35:13.066
Please.

35:15.734 --> 35:17.436
Help me out here.

35:21.975 --> 35:24.810
So we can stop playing fucking
Brady Bunch.

35:30.016 --> 35:32.953
Fucking Christ man!

35:33.219 --> 35:36.389
Fuck, what do you do for an
encore, a fucking Brazilian?

35:36.522 --> 35:37.790
What the fuck?

35:38.624 --> 35:40.393
Look, what time is it?

35:40.526 --> 35:42.062
Anybody, ten o'clock?

35:42.195 --> 35:44.730
Roughly ten o'clock, right?
Ten o'clock on a Saturday night.

35:44.864 --> 35:47.167
Where else do you think a kid
with a new car would be?

35:47.300 --> 35:50.904
Out on a cruise, joyriding.
That's what these kids do.

35:51.037 --> 35:53.306
That's what those cars are
designed for.

35:53.440 --> 35:58.477
Joyrides, it be fucking criminal if he was
doing anything else, man. No pun intended.

35:58.610 --> 36:00.914
That's what fucking concerns me.

36:01.047 --> 36:03.049
- Dennis, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

36:03.183 --> 36:06.685
'Cause Tony,
he was out on a joyride, too.

36:06.819 --> 36:08.088
- Right?
- Okay.

36:08.388 --> 36:12.758
In that same exact fucking car
that you let him borrow.

36:12.892 --> 36:14.160
Remember what happened to Tony?

36:14.294 --> 36:15.929
I didn't know all the shit
he was in to.

36:16.062 --> 36:17.931
He wanted to borrow a car, fine.
It's a shit box, man.

36:18.198 --> 36:22.002
It's worth 200 bucks. Think about it.
Just think about it.

36:23.136 --> 36:26.339
If I'd have known what the fuck
Tony was up to,

36:26.473 --> 36:27.941
you think for one fucking second

36:28.074 --> 36:30.276
I would have sold that kid,
Mikey, the fucking car?

36:31.610 --> 36:32.946
No, no, man.

36:33.079 --> 36:35.315
It doesn't take a genius to
figure that out.

36:35.448 --> 36:37.150
For fuck's sake, man.

36:37.283 --> 36:39.085
I could be a sailor,
I could be a priest.

36:39.219 --> 36:41.087
I could swear to you seven
different ways

36:41.221 --> 36:44.024
to fucking doomsday,
but I swear to ya,

36:44.157 --> 36:45.859
I don't know shit.

37:08.547 --> 37:09.916
You don't know anything?

37:11.151 --> 37:12.318
No.

37:13.486 --> 37:14.521
Okay.

37:15.055 --> 37:18.557
Well, let me tell you
what I know.

37:21.961 --> 37:27.699
I know that... that five star
beach side resort

37:27.834 --> 37:30.636
in the sky
that Tony checked into,

37:31.471 --> 37:33.106
I know that they're always

37:33.306 --> 37:35.774
accepting new clientele,
you know?

37:37.010 --> 37:40.947
You know there's always a...
vacancy open there...

37:42.115 --> 37:44.683
and... Dennis...

37:45.751 --> 37:48.254
if that fucking car
does not show up...

37:52.992 --> 37:54.861
I'm gonna check myself in.

37:58.697 --> 38:00.033
But...

38:01.101 --> 38:02.634
you're gonna check in first.

38:02.768 --> 38:04.904
Come on, man,
what are you doing? I've got...

38:05.972 --> 38:09.109
Somebody give me
a goddamn drill.

39:34.627 --> 39:35.895
One second.

39:37.330 --> 39:39.132
Excuse me.
See I think...

39:39.265 --> 39:41.067
- We used to own this car.
- Right, yes, yes.

39:41.201 --> 39:42.535
We used to own this car,
I think.

39:42.669 --> 39:43.802
Hey, hang on.

39:44.604 --> 39:47.340
Yeah, it's still there.
It looks good, too.

39:47.473 --> 39:48.740
I redid the seat cover.

39:48.875 --> 39:50.443
The blood wouldn't come out.

39:51.678 --> 39:54.447
Oh, sorry.
This was 1982.

39:54.581 --> 39:56.349
We were out on the highway
in the middle of nowhere.

39:56.482 --> 39:59.018
No idea where I was,
the cops are hightailing after us.

39:59.152 --> 40:01.054
- I'm screaming like you wouldn't believe.
- Right, right.

40:01.187 --> 40:02.488
- And then my water broke.
- Right, right.

40:02.622 --> 40:04.224
- So, I gotta pull over.
- It's our first born.

40:04.357 --> 40:06.192
And the second I do,
there's cops everywhere.

40:06.326 --> 40:08.760
- They got their guns drawn.
- They think he's a kidnapper.

40:08.895 --> 40:10.263
They're hollering.

40:10.463 --> 40:12.031
- They're telling us all...
- I'm yelling, "Stop!

40:12.165 --> 40:13.933
Somebody's gotta grab this baby
coming out of me."

40:14.067 --> 40:16.002
So, I'm just like, "Sorry, Officer,
I gotta help my wife right now,

40:16.135 --> 40:17.803
- you can arrest me later."
- So at this point.

40:17.937 --> 40:19.172
I've gotta...
I've gotta stretch out.

40:19.305 --> 40:20.707
Right, good thing
it was a bench seat.

40:20.840 --> 40:21.674
And I close my eyes
and push.

40:21.807 --> 40:23.209
And our little girl...

40:24.677 --> 40:27.213
she just falls out into my arms.

40:31.817 --> 40:35.121
And then the placenta pops out
of me and hits him in the face,

40:35.255 --> 40:38.524
and he falls backwards,
but he does not drop our baby.

40:38.658 --> 40:41.394
That's when I knew.
World's greatest dad.

40:41.527 --> 40:42.495
Oh.

40:44.831 --> 40:45.932
Gosh.

40:46.866 --> 40:48.800
- Time flies.
- Hm.

41:04.384 --> 41:07.520
Hey, this might be
a little strange,

41:07.654 --> 41:09.389
or, I don't know, rude,
but...

41:09.989 --> 41:12.191
Could we take the car out
for a drive?

41:12.791 --> 41:14.160
Oh, uh...

41:14.294 --> 41:15.628
Well, you could go
with us, of course.

41:15.762 --> 41:16.963
I... I... I...

41:17.096 --> 41:19.198
Yeah,
we wouldn't run off with her.

41:19.332 --> 41:20.933
We could pay you something.

41:21.067 --> 41:24.803
No, no that's okay.
I honestly should be getting...

41:24.937 --> 41:27.373
Three hundred.
What do you think?

41:27.507 --> 41:29.142
Three hundred,
is that good for, I don't know,

41:29.275 --> 41:30.977
20 minutes, half an hour?

41:31.944 --> 41:33.880
Well, we can pay you more
if you want?

41:34.013 --> 41:35.081
I don't know, a thousand?

41:35.214 --> 41:38.217
- What?
- That's okay, um...

41:39.085 --> 41:41.954
It's... 300 is fine.

41:42.655 --> 41:43.890
Thank you.

41:44.023 --> 41:46.025
That's more than 300.

41:57.036 --> 41:58.204
Let's go.

42:14.053 --> 42:16.089
Kinda cold,
do you want some heat?

42:19.726 --> 42:21.260
You remember that?

42:22.095 --> 42:24.163
How could I forget?

42:27.066 --> 42:28.901
You wanna drive up there?

42:35.208 --> 42:36.342
There's the turn.

42:42.382 --> 42:44.083
Um... Where are we going?

43:18.017 --> 43:19.652
The town's really changed.

43:22.655 --> 43:23.923
I'll be darned.

43:27.827 --> 43:29.662
I've never been up here before.

43:30.930 --> 43:33.065
We came here on our first date.

43:47.747 --> 43:49.415
Some things never change.

44:18.077 --> 44:19.545
Is that it?

44:20.213 --> 44:21.414
I'm sorry baby.

44:21.547 --> 44:23.616
- Get off.
- I'm sorry.

44:24.383 --> 44:26.419
Take care of myself later.

44:32.391 --> 44:33.459
Donnie.

44:36.028 --> 44:37.230
Donnie.

44:41.300 --> 44:43.236
Is that that stupid car?

44:48.641 --> 44:49.943
- <i>Bro.</i>
- What's up, Yoko Ono?

44:50.076 --> 44:51.677
Fucking up somebody else's shit?

44:51.811 --> 44:53.379
Calm down.

44:53.746 --> 44:55.248
Hey, when's the last time you
did something not named Mikaylah?

44:55.481 --> 44:58.818
Listen man, the kid,
his freaking car is right here,

44:58.952 --> 45:00.586
right in front of my eyes, bro.

45:01.053 --> 45:04.290
You know that spot,
that make out spot with the dope-ass view?

45:05.224 --> 45:06.759
I'm just gonna handle it
real quick.

45:06.894 --> 45:08.962
No, no, no you're not gonna
handle shit. Okay, brain trust?

45:09.095 --> 45:11.464
You remember the last time I had
you handle something?

45:11.999 --> 45:13.366
Do you remember Stanley?

45:13.533 --> 45:16.102
<i>My best friend in the whole
world, Stanley,</i>

45:16.235 --> 45:17.637
<i>do you remember that?</i>

45:18.437 --> 45:20.306
Hamsters are not aquatic, Lenny!

45:20.439 --> 45:21.374
What the fuck is happening?

45:21.507 --> 45:23.643
Donnie found the car.

45:26.212 --> 45:27.580
Fucking go get it.

46:01.014 --> 46:02.214
Um...

46:36.917 --> 46:38.250
Hi.

46:41.554 --> 46:43.189
Fuck! Get off her!

46:43.322 --> 46:44.690
Jesus!

46:44.824 --> 46:45.725
What the fuck?

46:49.295 --> 46:50.931
Hey, let go of me!

46:51.697 --> 46:54.101
Sorry,
we're gonna have to kill you.

46:54.233 --> 46:55.267
You saw our faces.

46:55.401 --> 46:56.736
Should have wore a mask.

46:56.870 --> 46:58.337
Shannon, knock it off.

46:58.471 --> 47:00.539
Will both of you shut the fuck
up and get this done?

47:00.673 --> 47:02.042
Will you stop yelling?

47:02.541 --> 47:03.977
I got somewhere to be and we all
got a fucking book to read.

47:04.111 --> 47:05.745
Yeah, well you can read it by
your own damn self,

47:05.879 --> 47:08.547
'cause after this jobs through,
I'm fucking quitting.

47:08.681 --> 47:10.182
You're quitting book club?

47:14.220 --> 47:15.721
Yeah, I'm quitting book club

47:15.856 --> 47:17.590
and being sucked into
one bone-head job

47:17.723 --> 47:20.259
after another and watching you
fuck 'em all up.

47:20.393 --> 47:21.862
- Real mature.
- Over and over again.

47:22.461 --> 47:24.664
- Real fucking mature.
- I can set my watch to your fucking screw ups.

47:24.797 --> 47:26.465
What are we gonna do
without you?

47:26.599 --> 47:29.335
Anyone can do my job, dumb ass.

47:29.468 --> 47:30.937
No, they can't.

47:32.005 --> 47:34.473
You want to quit?
Then get the fuck out of here.

47:34.607 --> 47:38.210
I'll do your part. I'll shoot all three of
these motherfuckers and load them in the car.

47:38.344 --> 47:40.947
- You can't fucking shoot them. Of course you...
- Why are you still talking?

47:41.081 --> 47:42.748
You just said you're gonna
fucking quit.

47:42.883 --> 47:44.417
I don't quit
in the middle of shit.

47:44.550 --> 47:45.818
You literally just said
you're gonna quit.

47:45.952 --> 47:47.186
I said I'm quitting after.

47:48.021 --> 47:49.522
- And leave us to do all the fucking work.
- I fucking said I quit after,

47:49.655 --> 47:50.891
- you fucking asshole.
- What the fuck?

47:51.323 --> 47:52.993
- That's exactly what you said.
- Do you not understand me?

47:53.559 --> 47:55.795
Do you not hear the words that
are coming out of your fucking mouth?

47:55.929 --> 47:57.196
- Chill out, Vince.
- Where the fuck is Donnie? I need to hit someone.

48:06.272 --> 48:07.807
Should we help them?

48:08.374 --> 48:09.508
Nope.

48:09.642 --> 48:11.343
It's not like I could help,
anyway.

48:14.380 --> 48:19.052
Why are you just regurgitating those stupid
shit comments that Vince makes about you?

48:19.186 --> 48:20.887
I mean, what's Vince even doing?

48:21.021 --> 48:24.590
Sitting around on his ass,
talking about that lame-ass book.

48:24.724 --> 48:27.460
It's not even a book.
It's a novella.

48:31.497 --> 48:32.966
Hey, hey, hey.

48:34.101 --> 48:35.334
Oh, fucking... Jeez!

49:06.133 --> 49:07.767
Babe, you're a badass.

49:08.201 --> 49:10.536
That's generous.

49:14.573 --> 49:16.642
Are you gonna kick some ass
for me?

49:20.213 --> 49:22.015
Quit fucking fighting me.

49:28.255 --> 49:29.688
You want this, huh?

49:30.223 --> 49:31.824
Open your fucking mouth.

49:35.128 --> 49:36.830
Hit 'em, baby, hit 'em.

49:44.570 --> 49:46.139
What the fuck?

49:49.475 --> 49:50.442
Get him in the car!

49:50.576 --> 49:52.378
Get him in the car!

49:54.014 --> 49:57.616
God damn it!
This fucking day is shit!

50:06.525 --> 50:08.327
Goddamn it! My fingers.

50:08.460 --> 50:10.563
Go! Just go!
Drive!

50:10.696 --> 50:13.399
It's not starting!
It's not starting!

50:18.138 --> 50:19.471
Go!

50:52.339 --> 50:53.706
Brett.

50:53.874 --> 50:54.941
You're never gonna guess where
we are right now.

50:55.075 --> 50:56.775
No, no. No, Brett.

50:56.910 --> 50:59.678
- Cosmic bowling, dude.
- <i>Brett, I need your help.</i>

50:59.812 --> 51:01.680
<i>Listen. Brett, Brett.</i>

51:01.814 --> 51:03.649
- Everybody here sucks.
- No, Brett, listen.

51:07.419 --> 51:09.089
<i>That's right! Pick it up!
Pick it up.</i>

51:09.222 --> 51:10.389
<i>That's down.</i>

51:10.789 --> 51:13.492
That's a strike! Well, close,
but that's a strike!

51:16.997 --> 51:17.998
Are you okay?

51:19.866 --> 51:21.167
Roger?

51:21.301 --> 51:22.501
Roger?

51:37.217 --> 51:38.550
<i>Mike?</i>

51:39.119 --> 51:40.186
<i>Mike!</i>

51:40.887 --> 51:41.687
Hey.

51:42.322 --> 51:45.424
The cops are gonna be here soon.
I'm just letting you know.

51:48.328 --> 51:49.762
And your grandma's awake.

51:49.896 --> 51:51.965
So, if you want to come back
and see her, you can.

51:52.098 --> 51:53.934
What about grandpa?

51:54.067 --> 51:55.201
He's dead.

53:53.319 --> 53:55.955
I know, I know this is what
everyone says,

53:56.089 --> 53:57.524
but I swear to you that...

53:57.656 --> 53:58.992
It's not what it looks like.

53:59.792 --> 54:01.194
You're holding it for a friend?

54:01.995 --> 54:03.496
Spacemen made you do it?

54:03.629 --> 54:04.931
Okay, hold on.

54:10.103 --> 54:11.071
Okay, um...

54:11.204 --> 54:13.406
You know that
I got the car today,

54:13.540 --> 54:18.078
but that stuff must have been
in there before I got it,

54:18.211 --> 54:21.580
and I swear to you,
it's... it's not mine.

54:21.713 --> 54:22.815
It's not.

54:27.554 --> 54:28.955
It's not his.

54:31.157 --> 54:32.192
It's not his.

54:38.231 --> 54:40.900
Thanks.

54:41.034 --> 54:42.768
- It's ours.
- What?

54:50.176 --> 54:53.812
Wait, wait, wait.

54:54.646 --> 54:55.482
Stop.

55:34.621 --> 55:35.855
Good boy.

55:39.791 --> 55:41.227
Thank you, Tony!

56:03.883 --> 56:04.984
Wait.

56:05.418 --> 56:06.853
My...

56:06.986 --> 56:08.955
<i>Yeah, that's my gutter queen!</i>

56:13.993 --> 56:16.062
Oh, my God, Jurassic Park.

56:16.896 --> 56:18.631
I got a pet velociraptor.

56:18.764 --> 56:20.732
What did you do for Kelsey,
Mike?

56:37.450 --> 56:38.784
Hey, hey.

56:38.952 --> 56:39.953
- Hey, stop, stop, stop.
- Hey, stop, stop.

56:40.086 --> 56:41.588
What the fuck are you doing?

56:41.720 --> 56:44.624
Why are you waving your goddamn
gun at the fucking thing?

56:44.756 --> 56:47.193
Because I'm trying to get
the fucking idiot to stop.

56:47.327 --> 56:48.661
Fuck's sakes!

56:48.995 --> 56:50.597
- Fuck you, all right?
- In your wildest fucking dreams.

56:50.729 --> 56:53.499
Oh, God, that makes me
want to fucking vomit.

58:07.607 --> 58:10.209
Boom! I get knocked right
across the face with a flashlight.

58:10.343 --> 58:12.078
I get...
I'm knocked down on the ground,

58:12.211 --> 58:13.546
the other cop, he just starts
kicking me and kicking me,

58:13.680 --> 58:15.515
and then right after that,
he snorts cocaine.

58:15.648 --> 58:17.417
He just snorted cocaine,
then they just take the car

58:17.550 --> 58:20.119
and throw my bike out
and then run it over,

58:20.253 --> 58:22.455
and yeah, that's...

58:25.925 --> 58:27.593
that's how I'm late.

58:30.496 --> 58:32.598
At least you still
have your ball sack.

58:43.576 --> 58:44.577
I'm sorry.

58:46.312 --> 58:50.183
Well, I didn't have to third
wheel with Chet and the Porsche.

58:50.616 --> 58:51.751
More like a fifth wheel.

58:51.884 --> 58:53.419
So, there's a spare tire, then?

58:53.653 --> 58:55.788
No, the donut.
That you really shouldn't even drive on.

58:55.922 --> 58:57.357
That was me.

58:57.824 --> 58:59.492
- You didn't even make it more than 50 miles, then?
- No, thank God

59:03.529 --> 59:06.032
Are you sure you don't need like
an ice pack or something?

59:06.165 --> 59:09.001
Um... I actually don't like it
when it's too cold

59:09.135 --> 59:11.037
on the wound, it's weird.

59:11.170 --> 59:12.972
- I don't know.
- What, why?

59:13.106 --> 59:14.574
I don't know. Um...

59:15.274 --> 59:17.577
- Like, 'cause...
- You're sensitive.

59:18.010 --> 59:19.011
What?

59:19.145 --> 59:20.413
Why are you embarrassed?

59:21.748 --> 59:24.317
More people could use a little
more of that.

59:24.450 --> 59:26.486
Like my parents.

59:27.220 --> 59:29.288
Okay your mom did talk
about my car a lot.

59:29.422 --> 59:33.459
It's ugly, but I honestly
just thought it was me...

59:34.060 --> 59:35.495
showing up late.

59:35.628 --> 59:38.531
No, they're great at reminding
me how shitty I am.

59:40.066 --> 59:41.367
What makes you say that?

59:43.603 --> 59:45.538
That doesn't sound like
something...

59:45.671 --> 59:47.039
Something I would say?

59:47.173 --> 59:48.641
Not really.

59:48.775 --> 59:49.976
Why?

59:50.476 --> 59:51.411
I mean, you...

59:52.111 --> 59:55.281
You get a lot of things right
and I feel like you know that.

59:55.415 --> 59:56.716
Oh, so you're calling me
arrogant?

59:56.850 --> 59:59.385
- No, no. I just...
- I'm over confidant.

59:59.519 --> 1:00:01.154
- No, Kelsey, you're...
- I'm...

1:00:01.287 --> 1:00:04.424
Kelsey, you're perfect...
perfectly confident.

1:00:06.592 --> 1:00:08.060
Nobody's perfect, Mike.

1:00:09.729 --> 1:00:14.267
Okay, well, if we were all made
out of oatmeal...

1:00:16.837 --> 1:00:18.171
What?

1:00:18.304 --> 1:00:20.239
Listen, and like Goldilocks
walked in, okay,

1:00:20.373 --> 1:00:22.208
- she'd pick your bowl.
- Oh, okay, yeah.

1:00:22.475 --> 1:00:25.745
- Be the bowl she picked.
- So, the asshole, arrogant, swollen head oatmeal

1:00:25.879 --> 1:00:28.581
- is over there?
- Exactly. And then, I'm on the other side of that.

1:00:28.714 --> 1:00:30.283
- Well, that's not fun.
- You're in the middle.

1:00:30.416 --> 1:00:31.617
Oh, okay,
so we're next to each other?

1:00:31.751 --> 1:00:33.953
- Yeah, totally, yeah.
- Okay, well...

1:00:34.420 --> 1:00:37.190
This bowl right here is big
enough for both of us.

1:00:37.757 --> 1:00:40.960
I mean, that's Goldilocks' bowl.
I can't touch that. That's...

1:00:41.093 --> 1:00:43.329
Yeah, but it's nice over here.

1:00:46.999 --> 1:00:48.401
Not too warm?

1:00:50.403 --> 1:00:52.438
- Not too cold.
- Yeah?

1:00:56.976 --> 1:00:58.411
Well, uh...

1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:15.394
Actually, um...

1:01:17.463 --> 1:01:19.265
- Do you want to...
- Come in?

1:01:19.398 --> 1:01:21.000
Do you want... Yeah.

1:01:21.667 --> 1:01:22.702
Finally.

1:01:23.736 --> 1:01:25.204
Could of swore
I locked the door.

1:01:25.338 --> 1:01:26.907
- This is it.
- Nice place.

1:01:27.039 --> 1:01:28.741
This is our humble abode.

1:01:29.308 --> 1:01:31.310
- Welcome.
- Oh, wow.

1:01:31.945 --> 1:01:33.045
Who is this?

1:01:33.179 --> 1:01:34.580
That's...
That's me.

1:01:34.714 --> 1:01:36.749
So, this was taken
yesterday, obviously.

1:01:36.884 --> 1:01:39.285
You want like a beer or
something?

1:01:39.418 --> 1:01:40.686
Yeah, sure.

1:01:41.922 --> 1:01:43.155
Wow, two sinks, huh?

1:01:43.289 --> 1:01:45.525
Oh, yeah,
we're kinda fancy out here.

1:01:45.758 --> 1:01:48.394
- Should I take my shoes off?
- No, no, you're fine.

1:01:48.528 --> 1:01:50.530
Just don't put your feet
on the coffee table,

1:01:50.663 --> 1:01:53.332
'cause my mom will have, like,
a heart attack,

1:01:53.466 --> 1:01:55.234
and yeah, so no feet.

1:01:57.203 --> 1:01:59.805
Um, I think, yeah,
Brett took all the beer,

1:01:59.940 --> 1:02:01.307
but we have soda...

1:02:11.617 --> 1:02:12.853
Please stop goddamn moving.

1:02:12.986 --> 1:02:15.054
Don't... Don't fucking move.

1:02:15.187 --> 1:02:17.089
Get out from behind
the fucking fridge.

1:02:18.291 --> 1:02:20.861
Move... Move from behind...

1:02:20.994 --> 1:02:24.297
Move from behind the fridge!
And close the goddamn door.

1:02:24.430 --> 1:02:26.165
You're letting
all the cold air out.

1:02:27.500 --> 1:02:30.403
Now, where's the fucking car?

1:02:32.071 --> 1:02:33.172
Um...

1:02:34.206 --> 1:02:35.441
I, um...

1:02:36.442 --> 1:02:38.444
I don't have it.

1:02:39.478 --> 1:02:42.548
I swear, I'm not lying.
I don't have the car.

1:02:42.682 --> 1:02:44.317
I swear,
just don't point it at her.

1:02:44.450 --> 1:02:46.452
Well, I'm feeling a little bit
fucking confused.

1:02:46.586 --> 1:02:47.955
A little confused right now,

1:02:48.087 --> 1:02:49.589
because this patron saint
of the neighborhood,

1:02:49.722 --> 1:02:55.494
he swore to me that he sold it
to you... today.

1:02:55.628 --> 1:02:56.796
Well, technically,
it was yesterday,

1:02:56.930 --> 1:02:58.531
it's past midnight, so...

1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:02.735
Hey, hey I swear.
I don't have the car, man.

1:03:02.869 --> 1:03:05.438
A couple of cops, they came and they
took it from me and they jumped me...

1:03:05.571 --> 1:03:08.608
Just don't, no.
Just stop speaking.

1:03:09.308 --> 1:03:13.179
I have been listening
to idiots speaking,

1:03:13.312 --> 1:03:16.950
and excusing
for the last week-and-a-half,

1:03:17.084 --> 1:03:19.585
and now,
when all I want to do...

1:03:20.519 --> 1:03:24.523
is just drown myself in hard
alcohol, I can't.

1:03:25.658 --> 1:03:28.527
'Cause one fucking idiot shot
another fucking idiot,

1:03:28.661 --> 1:03:31.098
fucking up instructions
so goddamn simple,

1:03:31.397 --> 1:03:33.766
my poor sweet nana,
who had Alzheimer's by the way,

1:03:33.900 --> 1:03:35.969
she could have rolled out of
the goddamn grave

1:03:36.103 --> 1:03:37.169
and done it herself.

1:03:37.303 --> 1:03:38.905
I swear to Christ.

1:03:39.039 --> 1:03:42.109
It's just like that fucking
short story, <i>Of Mice and Men,</i>

1:03:42.642 --> 1:03:45.244
with the fucking...
the big guy...

1:03:45.678 --> 1:03:48.180
It's a novella, actually.

1:04:10.670 --> 1:04:11.838
Oh, God.

1:04:12.271 --> 1:04:13.773
Am I the fucking idiot?

1:04:15.608 --> 1:04:17.978
I'm the fucking idiot.
It's me.

1:04:18.111 --> 1:04:19.278
I'm the fucking idiot.

1:04:21.114 --> 1:04:22.214
Excuse me.

1:04:22.983 --> 1:04:24.250
Don't fucking move.

1:04:25.052 --> 1:04:26.419
Hello?

1:04:26.987 --> 1:04:28.421
- <i>Oh, you finally pick up.</i>
- Yeah, what?

1:04:28.554 --> 1:04:29.990
<i>Yeah, we need fucking...</i>

1:04:30.289 --> 1:04:31.524
Well, what the fuck is going on?

1:04:33.126 --> 1:04:36.063
I'm losing you. Do you have...
Hello? Hello?

1:04:36.195 --> 1:04:37.396
I can't...

1:04:39.598 --> 1:04:41.534
I know how to find the car!

1:04:41.667 --> 1:04:44.871
I know how to find the car!
I know... I know how to find it.

1:04:45.371 --> 1:04:46.372
What?

1:04:46.973 --> 1:04:49.542
My phone...
I dropped it in the car

1:04:49.675 --> 1:04:53.312
before the cops took it.
I can track it on that app.

1:04:53.813 --> 1:04:56.615
I lose my phone all the time.
Anyways, I can track it,

1:04:56.749 --> 1:04:59.418
it can tell us exactly
where they are, but, um...

1:05:00.252 --> 1:05:05.158
sir, if we show you,
you have to...

1:05:05.892 --> 1:05:09.361
you have to let us go
and you can't kill anyone.

1:05:17.269 --> 1:05:18.671
Mikey, is it?

1:05:18.804 --> 1:05:19.739
Mike.

1:05:20.372 --> 1:05:21.975
Mike. Thank you.

1:05:23.944 --> 1:05:24.978
Mike.

1:05:26.947 --> 1:05:29.015
If I don't get
my fucking drugs...

1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:36.022
I'm gonna kill everyone.

1:05:36.522 --> 1:05:37.858
Mm-hm.

1:05:44.965 --> 1:05:49.202
Um... Okay.
So, give me one sec.

1:05:49.702 --> 1:05:51.238
Looks like it's
in the middle of nowhere.

1:05:51.370 --> 1:05:54.174
Not fucking good enough.
An address.

1:05:54.306 --> 1:05:56.509
Okay, all right. Sorry.

1:05:58.078 --> 1:05:59.678
Do you see that?

1:06:00.579 --> 1:06:02.348
Do you know what,
I just wiped my feet

1:06:02.481 --> 1:06:06.418
all over you
with a single fucking sentence?

1:06:06.552 --> 1:06:09.789
That's why you are
where you are right now.

1:06:10.190 --> 1:06:12.424
I bet you let your friends treat
you like shit, too, huh?

1:06:12.558 --> 1:06:13.927
Like you know anything
about friends.

1:06:14.060 --> 1:06:15.294
What?

1:06:16.362 --> 1:06:17.463
What?

1:06:18.497 --> 1:06:20.566
- What?
- Hm? Friends?

1:06:20.699 --> 1:06:23.203
I know plenty
about fucking friendship.

1:06:23.335 --> 1:06:25.906
Goddamn...
What's your name?

1:06:26.039 --> 1:06:27.306
Kelsey.

1:06:27.874 --> 1:06:29.542
Kelsey, why don't you take a look
at this motherfucker right here?

1:06:29.675 --> 1:06:34.181
Hm? And see what happens
to rude goddamn fucking people

1:06:34.313 --> 1:06:38.484
who fuck with people who have
goddamn guns in their hands.

1:06:38.617 --> 1:06:42.189
Hey, Mike,
take it from me, this one,

1:06:42.321 --> 1:06:44.356
she's going to steamroll
over you,

1:06:44.490 --> 1:06:46.625
I swear to god, she is.

1:06:47.928 --> 1:06:48.962
Oh, my God.

1:06:49.361 --> 1:06:50.329
- What the fuck are you...
- Kid's got a fucking point.

1:06:50.462 --> 1:06:51.630
Oh, my God.

1:06:51.764 --> 1:06:53.133
You walk in the room
and all you do

1:06:53.465 --> 1:06:54.935
is sour the fucking atmosphere
like a fart in church, man.

1:06:55.068 --> 1:06:56.569
Hey, look in the...
I've got duct tape.

1:06:56.702 --> 1:06:58.104
Oh, phone call.
Must be the book club.

1:06:58.238 --> 1:07:00.307
- Hey, what's their next book?
- Hey, look at me.

1:07:00.439 --> 1:07:03.076
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Where the fuck are you guys?

1:07:03.210 --> 1:07:05.744
Oh, I don't know. Trying to
hitch a ride at 3:00 a.m.

1:07:05.879 --> 1:07:08.681
on the scenic road
to east of fucking Eden

1:07:08.814 --> 1:07:11.017
while Donnie's playing
demolition derby...

1:07:11.151 --> 1:07:13.286
- Sounds like Vince. Double digit IQ.
- Huh?

1:07:13.419 --> 1:07:16.655
So excuse me for not picking
up the phone. I was fucking...

1:07:16.789 --> 1:07:18.457
Shut the fuck up and listen to
me for a second.

1:07:18.591 --> 1:07:21.061
We are tracking the car
right now.

1:07:21.194 --> 1:07:22.661
Where are you?

1:07:22.896 --> 1:07:23.964
<i>Listen to me,
we're tracking the fucking car.</i>

1:07:24.097 --> 1:07:25.265
Cap, hello?

1:07:25.464 --> 1:07:27.067
The fucking...
Show me the fucking screen.

1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:29.035
- Come on! Where... Where...
- Cup of coffee.

1:07:29.169 --> 1:07:31.037
No cream, no sugar.
I'll take it black. I don't care.

1:07:31.171 --> 1:07:32.906
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1:07:33.039 --> 1:07:35.608
What are you talking about?
Find it!

1:07:35.741 --> 1:07:36.809
Okay, it's still loading.

1:07:36.943 --> 1:07:38.377
- Ten...
- Okay. Whoa! Whoa!

1:07:38.510 --> 1:07:40.579
...nine, eight...
Hey! What the fuck?

1:07:41.380 --> 1:07:43.116
- You see that?
- I'm gonna find it.

1:07:43.250 --> 1:07:44.683
Work the fucker.

1:07:44.885 --> 1:07:46.953
- Okay, okay.
- This thing got autopilot?

1:07:47.087 --> 1:07:48.288
Oh, it's right here.

1:07:48.787 --> 1:07:54.460
Give it to me.
It is off of Wilson Road.

1:07:54.593 --> 1:07:57.297
<i>Five miles past Maury's Diner.</i>

1:07:57.563 --> 1:07:59.032
- What's the address?
- <i>Huh?</i>

1:07:59.165 --> 1:08:00.699
What's the fucking
address?

1:08:01.001 --> 1:08:03.569
<i>Use the odometer and
your fucking eyeballs,</i>

1:08:03.702 --> 1:08:05.437
<i>and figure it the fuck out!</i>

1:08:05.571 --> 1:08:07.173
What the fuck
is going on now?

1:08:07.307 --> 1:08:08.507
Fuck!

1:08:12.112 --> 1:08:15.681
Take the fucking mask off.
It's got mace on it, stupid.

1:08:15.814 --> 1:08:19.085
It's all right.
It's just in my eyes.

1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:21.388
All right, come on.

1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:23.089
I'm gonna wash it for ya.
Come on.

1:08:23.223 --> 1:08:24.456
Really?

1:08:24.723 --> 1:08:26.092
I don't want you breathing in
that toxic shit.

1:08:26.993 --> 1:08:28.627
It might kill you or something.

1:08:29.195 --> 1:08:33.233
How am I supposed to find it
without a fucking address or a car?

1:08:33.366 --> 1:08:34.901
My car just fucking...

1:08:35.434 --> 1:08:36.602
Donnie!

1:08:36.735 --> 1:08:38.405
Donnie! Donnie!
Stop that truck!

1:08:38.537 --> 1:08:42.242
Donnie, no, don't let her leave!
Donnie, don't let her leave!

1:08:45.278 --> 1:08:46.947
<i>If I'm gonna die,
I'd like to at least die</i>

1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:48.747
at the hand's somebody
that would know

1:08:48.882 --> 1:08:50.716
how to pour piss out of a boot
without having to read

1:08:50.850 --> 1:08:52.484
the instructions
on the fucking heel.

1:08:52.618 --> 1:08:54.154
Hey, reach in the glove box.

1:08:54.287 --> 1:08:56.488
There's duct tape in there,
give it to me.

1:08:56.622 --> 1:08:58.524
- Hand it to me.
- Oh, great, more tape.

1:08:58.657 --> 1:09:00.659
- Thanks, sport.
- Shut the fuck...

1:09:35.228 --> 1:09:36.229
Go around.

1:09:59.152 --> 1:10:00.286
Hit the lights.

1:10:41.727 --> 1:10:43.029
Hand me the fucking keys.

1:10:46.099 --> 1:10:47.133
The keys.

1:10:54.307 --> 1:10:55.208
Okay.

1:10:56.342 --> 1:10:59.079
Everybody out
of the fucking car.

1:11:03.349 --> 1:11:05.985
All right.
I'm not supposed to say anything

1:11:06.119 --> 1:11:10.223
but between me and you,
word on the street is

1:11:10.356 --> 1:11:15.128
one of Tony's dumb ass dudes
shot him through a door.

1:11:15.261 --> 1:11:16.896
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

1:11:17.030 --> 1:11:18.664
Look, you can't
make these things up, right?

1:11:18.797 --> 1:11:20.366
Are you saying
his own dude?

1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:22.135
Look, okay, first of all.

1:11:22.268 --> 1:11:25.905
I was talking to the boss,
he said, on the phone,

1:11:26.039 --> 1:11:30.110
this dude sounded like
the biggest idiot he ever heard

1:11:30.243 --> 1:11:30.944
and you know...

1:11:31.077 --> 1:11:32.644
Did you hear that?

1:11:33.513 --> 1:11:34.914
Hear what?

1:11:35.048 --> 1:11:36.983
That noise out there.

1:11:37.484 --> 1:11:38.918
Mike.

1:11:39.052 --> 1:11:40.520
Probably coyotes,
or werewolves, or something.

1:11:40.652 --> 1:11:41.620
I fucking heard it.

1:11:41.753 --> 1:11:42.989
Go.

1:11:44.357 --> 1:11:45.691
What the fuck?

1:11:47.127 --> 1:11:49.162
What are you gonna do?
Crawl through a vent somewhere?

1:11:49.295 --> 1:11:50.597
I don't know, maybe.

1:11:50.729 --> 1:11:52.731
Do like a human shield,
or something.

1:11:52.866 --> 1:11:54.300
Yeah, you can go first.

1:11:54.901 --> 1:11:56.436
Eye contact.

1:11:56.569 --> 1:11:58.770
You are very fucking rude,
and let me tell you something,

1:11:58.905 --> 1:12:00.340
it's not gonna get you far.

1:12:00.473 --> 1:12:01.640
Just give me a fucking idea.

1:12:05.744 --> 1:12:08.414
Hey, be fucking quiet.

1:12:18.858 --> 1:12:20.226
Ow!

1:12:24.663 --> 1:12:27.433
Go to sleep. God damn it!

1:12:29.068 --> 1:12:31.670
Go to sleep. That's it.
That's it. That's it. Shh!

1:12:39.846 --> 1:12:42.081
God! Fucking Christ!

1:12:47.287 --> 1:12:48.354
Hey, stop.

1:12:48.488 --> 1:12:49.322
Stop.

1:13:01.901 --> 1:13:04.137
Are you... Are you okay?

1:13:08.508 --> 1:13:09.775
Are you okay?

1:13:09.909 --> 1:13:11.844
Yeah,
just got to get his keys.

1:13:11.978 --> 1:13:14.981
Where... Where's Dennis?

1:13:22.922 --> 1:13:25.191
What is he doing?

1:13:34.300 --> 1:13:36.936
Date night just keep getting
better and better, don't it?

1:14:05.431 --> 1:14:06.633
Look at this.

1:14:06.765 --> 1:14:08.334
Hammer time.

1:14:08.468 --> 1:14:10.003
Good shit right here.

1:14:10.769 --> 1:14:12.038
Nice.

1:14:32.425 --> 1:14:33.326
Michael.

1:14:34.227 --> 1:14:36.863
Thought we were done with you.

1:14:44.704 --> 1:14:47.173
Ah, Tony.
Son of a bitch.

1:14:51.744 --> 1:14:54.714
Dennis, your wife is worried
sick about you, by the way.

1:14:56.783 --> 1:14:58.985
And you look familiar.

1:14:59.752 --> 1:15:02.422
Think There's a photograph
on a file on my desk.

1:15:02.555 --> 1:15:03.923
You get a break.

1:15:04.390 --> 1:15:05.925
You get a break, we all get a break.

1:15:06.059 --> 1:15:08.328
- Tony's file.
- Fuck off, doughnut!

1:15:08.995 --> 1:15:10.196
Excuse me?

1:15:10.997 --> 1:15:12.899
Hey.

1:15:13.032 --> 1:15:14.967
Sir, hey, hi.

1:15:15.468 --> 1:15:16.969
Hey, sir.

1:15:18.538 --> 1:15:19.439
Hello.

1:15:20.606 --> 1:15:23.776
That... That is my score.

1:15:24.644 --> 1:15:28.581
Me! I'm the one that brought
that to you.

1:15:28.981 --> 1:15:30.350
We've been talking for weeks.

1:15:30.483 --> 1:15:32.685
All right,
so I don't know how...

1:15:32.819 --> 1:15:34.954
what the fuck happened?

1:15:35.088 --> 1:15:37.457
UPS, FedEx.

1:15:38.891 --> 1:15:40.526
Fucking Pony Express.

1:15:40.660 --> 1:15:42.929
I don't care who delivers
my product.

1:15:43.062 --> 1:15:45.465
The key word there, though,
is "delivery."

1:15:47.333 --> 1:15:49.001
Ah! Ah! See that's bullshit.

1:15:49.135 --> 1:15:51.304
Hey, doughnut. What was the name
of the guy, his gang member,

1:15:51.437 --> 1:15:52.905
the one he shot
through the door?

1:15:53.039 --> 1:15:54.407
That was Tony.

1:15:54.540 --> 1:15:58.344
Tony. Now that...
that's just poor leadership.

1:16:00.980 --> 1:16:02.448
Fucking love the boss.

1:16:02.682 --> 1:16:04.050
That... I didn't...
That wasn't me that shot him,

1:16:04.183 --> 1:16:05.618
that was a guy that works for
me.

1:16:05.752 --> 1:16:07.153
Open it up, show her.

1:16:19.198 --> 1:16:20.633
Just like a fucking cop.

1:16:21.234 --> 1:16:24.704
Wiping your ass with
a hard-working civilian.

1:16:24.838 --> 1:16:26.973
Whoa, whoa.
Did I just hear him right?

1:16:27.106 --> 1:16:28.741
Did he just volunteer to die
first?

1:16:29.008 --> 1:16:31.144
- Mm-hm.
- I was tuning him out, I wasn't listening.

1:16:31.277 --> 1:16:33.913
I assumed you would
want to kill Michael first.

1:16:38.050 --> 1:16:39.719
Oh. Excuse me, sorry.

1:16:39.853 --> 1:16:42.021
we're just trying to get out
to clear the mess.

1:16:42.155 --> 1:16:43.289
We got a lot
of body weight

1:16:43.423 --> 1:16:44.524
for just a couple trash bags.

1:16:44.657 --> 1:16:46.259
Oh, these are not
just trash bags.

1:16:46.392 --> 1:16:48.227
These are industrial strength,
commercial grade,

1:16:48.361 --> 1:16:49.562
- contractor bags.
- Really?

1:16:49.695 --> 1:16:51.497
Yeah.
Man, we got these from Lowes.

1:16:51.631 --> 1:16:53.099
Hold a big load,
no tears, no spills.

1:16:53.232 --> 1:16:54.400
They don't leak at all?

1:16:54.534 --> 1:16:55.435
No ma'am.

1:16:55.568 --> 1:16:57.203
I've used these.
They fucking leak.

1:16:57.336 --> 1:17:00.039
- $3.99 a box on aisle three.
- Very good.

1:17:00.173 --> 1:17:01.707
Right next to
the industrial hardware.

1:17:03.075 --> 1:17:05.645
Don't touch him!

1:17:09.282 --> 1:17:12.251
Sorry, do we need a bag
underneath him before we shoot?

1:17:14.220 --> 1:17:16.055
Five miles past
the fucking diner?

1:17:16.189 --> 1:17:17.723
This is fucking weird.
I don't like it.

1:17:17.925 --> 1:17:20.326
Looks like fucking...
"Hills Has Eyes" or <i>Deliverance.</i>

1:17:20.460 --> 1:17:22.261
- <i>Hills Have Eyes.</i>
- Uh, hey, guys.

1:17:22.395 --> 1:17:24.297
- I think he's over there.
- What the fuck?

1:17:24.430 --> 1:17:28.234
Everybody, get down!
Everybody, get fucking down!

1:17:28.367 --> 1:17:29.202
Motherfucker!

1:17:31.270 --> 1:17:32.873
- What took so goddamn long?
- I don't know.

1:17:33.005 --> 1:17:35.007
What the fuck are you doing?
What's all this shit?

1:17:35.141 --> 1:17:36.576
- Jesus Christ!
- Get the fuck away.

1:17:36.877 --> 1:17:38.711
Put your guns down or I'll explode.

1:17:38.846 --> 1:17:40.646
Wait a second!

1:17:40.780 --> 1:17:44.016
Everybody, just wait one second.

1:17:44.584 --> 1:17:49.522
We need to take a moment
to think and be civil,

1:17:49.655 --> 1:17:53.626
and I assure you,
we can all get what we need...

1:17:53.759 --> 1:17:55.261
from this situation.

1:17:55.995 --> 1:17:57.296
- What do you want?
- The coke.

1:17:57.430 --> 1:17:58.731
And the product
is on the premises,

1:17:58.866 --> 1:18:01.334
- we have an arrangement.
- Absolutely.

1:18:02.268 --> 1:18:04.203
All of you, what do you want?

1:18:04.337 --> 1:18:05.771
We want our boss.

1:18:07.206 --> 1:18:08.374
Yeah. This man?

1:18:08.508 --> 1:18:09.843
- Yeah.
- That's right.

1:18:10.009 --> 1:18:11.777
Yeah, we're not
leaving here without him.

1:18:12.111 --> 1:18:14.180
- That's right.
- That's right. - Yeah, all right.

1:18:14.313 --> 1:18:16.382
Yeah, and you know what, we're not
leaving without the money either.

1:18:16.516 --> 1:18:18.584
- That's right.
- Oh, I think there's money enough for more than one party.

1:18:18.718 --> 1:18:20.553
- What the fuck?
- No, hear me out, okay.

1:18:20.686 --> 1:18:23.456
We both deserve to be compensated
for the work we've done,

1:18:23.589 --> 1:18:25.658
but since we actually did
deliver the product,

1:18:25.791 --> 1:18:27.861
- I propose 60/40 split.
- That's fucking bullshit!

1:18:27.995 --> 1:18:29.128
Are you kidding?

1:18:29.262 --> 1:18:30.596
Do you know how much
fucking work

1:18:30.730 --> 1:18:32.966
I just did to get this fucking
shit together?

1:18:33.099 --> 1:18:35.635
I got my fucking hand slammed in the fucking door.

1:18:35.768 --> 1:18:37.871
- I had to hitchhike...
- Who fucking cares?

1:18:38.005 --> 1:18:41.140
Okay, we can just kill him now.
It's no skin off my nose.

1:18:41.274 --> 1:18:42.275
No, no,
you're not gonna kill any.

1:18:42.408 --> 1:18:43.643
You know what? You know what?

1:18:43.776 --> 1:18:45.111
I dare you
to pull the fucking trigger.

1:18:45.244 --> 1:18:46.779
I'll just kill him right now.

1:18:46.914 --> 1:18:48.548
Guys, shut the fuck up!

1:18:48.681 --> 1:18:50.416
I'll fucking waste you,
you fucking pig.

1:18:50.616 --> 1:18:52.552
- How do you feel about that?
- ...the fucking shot.

1:18:52.685 --> 1:18:57.189
Hey! Can we do 50/50 plus a long
term partnership?

1:19:00.760 --> 1:19:01.827
Donnie...

1:19:04.163 --> 1:19:06.532
I'll put your fucking nuts
in a jar.

1:19:06.666 --> 1:19:07.567
Shut up!

1:19:10.102 --> 1:19:12.005
We already did this on accident.

1:19:12.772 --> 1:19:15.675
They were able to bring the
drugs easy because they're cops.

1:19:16.910 --> 1:19:19.812
If we let them deliver for us
in the future, it'd be safer...

1:19:20.513 --> 1:19:21.781
for all of us, right?

1:19:23.182 --> 1:19:24.417
That's a fine proposal.

1:19:24.918 --> 1:19:27.186
He must be the genius of
their group, boss.

1:19:27.820 --> 1:19:31.858
Donnie, that's...
that's actually not a bad idea.

1:19:35.028 --> 1:19:38.564
Are we fucking good?
Can I... Can I go now?

1:19:39.066 --> 1:19:41.500
What about these three? They seen
our faces, they still need to go.

1:19:41.634 --> 1:19:43.369
You should have worn
a fucking mask!

1:19:43.502 --> 1:19:45.104
They're our responsibility...

1:19:45.839 --> 1:19:50.710
and we will handle them as soon
as we all take a breath...

1:19:51.277 --> 1:19:52.745
and lower our weapons.

1:19:56.349 --> 1:19:57.617
On three.

1:19:59.987 --> 1:20:01.220
One...

1:20:04.457 --> 1:20:06.626
...two...

1:20:12.131 --> 1:20:13.232
three.

1:20:16.202 --> 1:20:17.503
Go ahead and lower.

1:20:17.637 --> 1:20:20.272
- Easy 'em down, guys.
- Bring 'em down, boys.

1:20:25.778 --> 1:20:26.779
Oh, Jesus!

1:20:36.222 --> 1:20:37.223
Dennis!

1:20:45.364 --> 1:20:47.233
Get me the fuck outta here!

1:20:52.471 --> 1:20:54.707
All right give me
your shell. A fucking shell!

1:20:54.841 --> 1:20:55.675
Donnie!

1:20:59.245 --> 1:21:00.780
We have to get out of here.

1:21:01.380 --> 1:21:03.850
- Motherfucker.
- Fucking light 'em up!

1:21:19.265 --> 1:21:20.399
Come on.

1:21:32.678 --> 1:21:33.579
Shannon.

1:21:34.480 --> 1:21:35.614
Look at me.

1:21:36.582 --> 1:21:38.551
Get the fucking money.

1:21:39.518 --> 1:21:41.888
The bag!
Get the fucking bag!

1:21:43.556 --> 1:21:45.825
- Go, go, go!
- Out there. Go, go!

1:21:50.229 --> 1:21:51.597
Go, go, go.

1:21:55.836 --> 1:21:56.669
Fuck you!

1:22:08.982 --> 1:22:12.318
Shannon! Shannon!
Go get the money.

1:22:13.819 --> 1:22:15.688
You can do it!
You can do it!

1:22:15.821 --> 1:22:17.723
- What the fuck?
- Jesus Christ!

1:22:17.858 --> 1:22:20.760
- All right, Captain.
- No wait, Shannon, stop!

1:22:20.894 --> 1:22:21.827
Fuck.

1:22:21.962 --> 1:22:23.930
I'm out! I'm out!

1:22:25.899 --> 1:22:26.900
Fuck!

1:22:28.434 --> 1:22:29.635
Fucker!

1:22:31.071 --> 1:22:32.172
I'm out.

1:22:36.776 --> 1:22:37.878
Yeah.

1:22:40.180 --> 1:22:41.447
Fuck!

1:22:42.082 --> 1:22:44.383
- Shannon!
- Fuck!

1:22:47.386 --> 1:22:49.189
Come on, bring him back,
come on!

1:22:49.990 --> 1:22:52.291
- What do we do?
- Who's left over?

1:22:52.424 --> 1:22:53.692
Who do we got?

1:22:53.826 --> 1:22:55.594
We could take that truck
right there.

1:22:55.728 --> 1:22:57.363
What if it's locked?

1:22:57.763 --> 1:22:59.598
What if there are no keys?

1:23:03.136 --> 1:23:04.670
I got you.
You're gonna be okay.

1:23:04.804 --> 1:23:06.173
You're gonna be fine,
don't worry about it.

1:23:08.208 --> 1:23:09.441
Fuck!

1:23:09.775 --> 1:23:11.011
- Leave it.
- You're gonna be fine.

1:23:11.144 --> 1:23:12.344
- Leave my mask on.
- Shannon.

1:23:13.579 --> 1:23:14.780
Leave it.

1:23:14.915 --> 1:23:16.249
Hey, lot of books to read,
all right?

1:23:16.382 --> 1:23:17.918
You can come over to my place.

1:23:18.051 --> 1:23:21.888
We'll watch fucking <i>Titanic,</i>
all right?

1:23:23.890 --> 1:23:24.790
Shannon?

1:23:26.026 --> 1:23:27.359
Shannon?

1:23:31.965 --> 1:23:34.167
- No.
- No!

1:23:34.301 --> 1:23:36.368
Fuck!

1:23:39.072 --> 1:23:40.273
Fuck you!

1:23:42.242 --> 1:23:43.342
Fuck you!

1:23:44.110 --> 1:23:45.011
Fuck you!

1:23:49.381 --> 1:23:51.483
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1:23:53.019 --> 1:23:54.386
Fuck! Fuck you!

1:23:56.223 --> 1:23:57.556
I'm out! I'm out! I'm out!

1:23:58.457 --> 1:24:01.460
You're gonna get
fucking shot, you crazy bitch.

1:24:06.765 --> 1:24:09.336
Fuckers!
Come on! That's right.

1:24:10.937 --> 1:24:13.772
Oh, shit.

1:24:15.208 --> 1:24:16.542
Go, go. Get the fuck
out of here! God damn it!

1:24:20.113 --> 1:24:22.048
You can thank me later for
saving your fucking life.

1:24:25.886 --> 1:24:28.654
No, Vince!

1:24:28.787 --> 1:24:30.957
You motherfuckers!

1:24:31.091 --> 1:24:34.627
I'm gonna fucking kill
every one of you.

1:24:37.197 --> 1:24:38.098
Donnie.

1:24:40.566 --> 1:24:42.468
Motherfucker!

1:24:42.601 --> 1:24:44.204
Fucking shoot them.
Fuck you!

1:25:02.289 --> 1:25:03.555
We gotta get those keys.

1:25:09.963 --> 1:25:10.864
Mike.

1:25:12.198 --> 1:25:13.333
We can do it.

1:25:18.204 --> 1:25:19.471
Let's do this.

1:25:31.717 --> 1:25:33.086
It's not good enough.

1:25:33.219 --> 1:25:35.088
Where are the keys?

1:25:35.221 --> 1:25:36.156
Reload.

1:25:36.289 --> 1:25:37.424
Oh, shit. We gotta go.

1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:42.228
Let's go! Go, go!

1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:56.109
Oh, shit!

1:26:10.457 --> 1:26:11.992
Fuck 'em, I'm leaving.

1:26:21.368 --> 1:26:22.634
What... What do we do?

1:26:22.768 --> 1:26:23.702
We don't call the cops,
that's for fucking sure.

1:26:23.837 --> 1:26:25.804
Yeah, I totally agree.

1:26:29.641 --> 1:26:31.044
You should have let me drive,
Davis.

1:26:31.177 --> 1:26:34.214
I drive. I always drive.
You shoot.

1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:42.688
- Mike!
- Yeah?

1:26:42.821 --> 1:26:45.859
They have a gun.

1:26:48.895 --> 1:26:50.130
On a scale of one to ten,

1:26:50.263 --> 1:26:51.663
how much fun are you having
right now?

1:26:51.797 --> 1:26:53.466
Eight point six out of ten.

1:26:54.100 --> 1:26:56.735
That's how bad it hurts
right now, bro.

1:27:02.308 --> 1:27:06.079
- Nice guys finish last.
- I thought we had something.

1:27:06.212 --> 1:27:09.215
It's like, it's like girls speak
in code.

1:27:09.349 --> 1:27:10.749
And I'm no Nick Cage.

1:27:10.884 --> 1:27:13.086
I'm no Nick Cage,
I can't crack codes that fast.

1:27:13.219 --> 1:27:14.320
No one can.

1:27:16.256 --> 1:27:19.926
I'd fail in a <i>National Treasure</i>
scenario.

1:27:24.130 --> 1:27:25.198
We all would.

1:27:31.471 --> 1:27:32.671
We all would.

1:27:33.206 --> 1:27:35.175
What's the plan, Mike?

1:27:35.308 --> 1:27:37.810
Um... Stay alive.
I don't know. I don't...

1:27:37.944 --> 1:27:39.479
Well, is there something we can
throw out the window?

1:27:39.611 --> 1:27:41.814
- Uh...
- Pop a tire or something?

1:27:44.817 --> 1:27:46.618
- You shoot them?
- I am shooting them.

1:27:46.752 --> 1:27:49.489
You're shooting around them.
Shoot them.

1:27:53.293 --> 1:27:55.028
Kid! Hey, Mike!

1:27:55.161 --> 1:27:56.563
You are not the fucking man
for this job.

1:27:56.695 --> 1:27:57.696
Give me the...

1:27:57.831 --> 1:27:59.566
Oh, shit. God damn it.

1:28:07.474 --> 1:28:10.143
Let me drive the fucking car!

1:28:18.518 --> 1:28:19.618
Hey, get off!

1:28:19.785 --> 1:28:21.121
Jesus!
Watch the fucking road.

1:28:21.254 --> 1:28:23.223
Are you crazy? Are you crazy?

1:28:23.356 --> 1:28:25.325
Fucking maniac!

1:28:32.165 --> 1:28:33.867
- Fuck!
- Just get in the car, sit down.

1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.468
- I'm out.
- Sit down.

1:28:35.602 --> 1:28:37.370
I'm out, Davis.

1:28:38.471 --> 1:28:39.539
What are you doing?

1:28:39.671 --> 1:28:41.074
I got more rounds in my pistol.

1:28:41.207 --> 1:28:43.376
- I said get back in the car.
- Davis, I got it.

1:28:43.510 --> 1:28:44.878
I said, sit down.

1:28:46.745 --> 1:28:47.981
Sit.

1:28:48.114 --> 1:28:49.182
Now.

1:28:56.523 --> 1:28:57.991
I'll do it myself.

1:29:00.326 --> 1:29:02.495
Mike!
Throw something out the window.

1:29:02.629 --> 1:29:05.899
Let me drive the fucking car.

1:29:06.798 --> 1:29:08.501
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1:29:09.035 --> 1:29:10.370
Get off me.

1:29:15.807 --> 1:29:17.177
Jesus!

1:29:19.979 --> 1:29:21.680
You started this.

1:29:28.288 --> 1:29:29.821
I told you
you should have let me drive.

1:29:36.930 --> 1:29:40.166
I told you...
I would do this myself.

1:29:58.618 --> 1:29:59.751
Whoa!

1:30:13.266 --> 1:30:14.701
Holy shit!

1:30:17.637 --> 1:30:18.737
No!

1:30:20.907 --> 1:30:24.776
You are so fucking rude!

1:30:25.912 --> 1:30:27.380
Mike! Mike!

1:30:27.947 --> 1:30:30.250
Oh, shit!

1:30:39.192 --> 1:30:40.159
Kelsey.

1:30:40.893 --> 1:30:42.595
Are you... You okay?

1:30:43.029 --> 1:30:45.064
Yeah.

1:30:48.601 --> 1:30:49.669
Is that?

1:30:49.801 --> 1:30:51.004
Mike?

1:30:53.840 --> 1:30:55.008
Mike?

1:30:55.308 --> 1:30:56.775
Get out of the car!
Put your hands up!

1:30:56.909 --> 1:30:57.744
You gotta have a horseshoe up
your ass, man.

1:30:57.877 --> 1:30:59.012
Where are the others?

1:30:59.279 --> 1:31:00.647
You're like the luckiest son of
a bitch I know.

1:31:00.779 --> 1:31:02.315
- Money, drugs, where is it?
- It's in the car.

1:31:05.752 --> 1:31:07.854
Holy shit.

1:31:10.990 --> 1:31:12.925
Holy shit.

1:31:13.059 --> 1:31:14.961
What is it?

1:31:17.463 --> 1:31:18.431
Baby, what is it?

1:31:29.475 --> 1:31:30.510
Is that the guy?

1:31:34.981 --> 1:31:36.149
What do we do?

1:31:36.282 --> 1:31:37.784
We gotta do something.
We gotta...

1:31:38.584 --> 1:31:41.654
That's the guy who did it.
What do we do?

1:31:41.788 --> 1:31:43.189
Dennis, what do we do?

1:31:43.623 --> 1:31:45.091
Do you want to kill him?

1:31:48.995 --> 1:31:50.229
Do you want to?

1:31:58.638 --> 1:32:00.573
Stop!

1:32:00.707 --> 1:32:01.974
Stop!

1:32:04.777 --> 1:32:07.246
I... I, um...

1:32:08.114 --> 1:32:10.016
I can't...
I can't let you kill him.

1:32:11.617 --> 1:32:13.019
Hey, um...

1:32:16.356 --> 1:32:17.357
Don't...

1:32:18.024 --> 1:32:19.292
Don't be like them.

1:32:24.297 --> 1:32:26.933
I know you're scared, okay. I...

1:32:30.303 --> 1:32:32.205
I've been scared my whole life.

1:32:37.377 --> 1:32:38.444
It's okay.

1:33:01.367 --> 1:33:02.902
You heard him.

1:33:04.170 --> 1:33:05.571
Take a walk.

1:33:41.941 --> 1:33:44.644
Well, I hope you're feeling
all fucking warm and fuzzy

1:33:44.777 --> 1:33:46.145
and all that good shit, kid.

1:33:46.279 --> 1:33:48.414
'Cause I'm feeling pretty good
right now.

1:33:52.552 --> 1:33:53.453
Baby, we happy?

1:33:53.586 --> 1:33:56.222
- Yeah.
- We are happy.

1:33:58.257 --> 1:33:59.625
Keys.

1:34:09.769 --> 1:34:12.438
You know, kid, we're kinda doing
you a huge favor here.

1:34:12.572 --> 1:34:15.007
You're walking off
with a scot-free record.

1:34:15.141 --> 1:34:17.210
As far as anybody else
is concerned,

1:34:18.311 --> 1:34:20.346
you ain't ever seen
this fucking car.

1:34:22.381 --> 1:34:24.050
Let's go, baby.
I'm following you.

1:34:24.183 --> 1:34:25.985
I got no GPS in here.

1:34:33.226 --> 1:34:36.329
Tony, I love you forever,
brother.

1:34:37.363 --> 1:34:40.466
Come on, baby, let's hit it.
We got daiquiris to drink.

1:34:41.801 --> 1:34:44.103
<i>Adios,</i> Mikey.

1:35:09.262 --> 1:35:11.097
I think we should
call Brett now.

1:35:13.499 --> 1:35:14.534
Yeah.

1:35:20.806 --> 1:35:23.109
Um... Shit, um...

1:35:24.176 --> 1:35:26.212
I left my phone in the car.

1:35:32.151 --> 1:35:33.252
Sorry.

1:35:50.904 --> 1:35:53.205
Are you finished
with the phone, dear?

1:35:56.242 --> 1:35:58.644
Uh... Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

1:36:02.049 --> 1:36:03.549
Would you like some coffee?

1:36:04.383 --> 1:36:05.718
Yes, please.

1:36:06.652 --> 1:36:08.220
It's our special roast.

1:36:08.989 --> 1:36:10.489
Night's still young.

1:36:24.437 --> 1:36:26.739
You know,
if you would have just told me

1:36:26.873 --> 1:36:28.207
you didn't have a car,

1:36:29.542 --> 1:36:31.243
I could have picked you up.

1:36:54.500 --> 1:36:56.937
Um... Brett said he's on the way

1:36:57.070 --> 1:37:01.540
to come pick us up
and take us home... soon.

1:37:03.609 --> 1:37:05.678
- Hm.
- Yeah.

1:37:09.883 --> 1:37:12.385
But... it's Brett....

1:37:13.954 --> 1:37:15.254
so...

1:37:16.288 --> 1:37:17.757
He'll take forever.

1:37:29.735 --> 1:37:31.704
Mike.

1:37:31.838 --> 1:37:33.739
Mike, come on!

1:37:33.874 --> 1:37:35.876
It's late,
you woke me up for this.

1:37:36.009 --> 1:37:38.377
Mike, I broke 30 laws
just to get here for you.

1:37:38.611 --> 1:37:41.048
You come out now.
I don't have all night.

1:37:41.180 --> 1:37:43.884
You interrupted my REM cycle.

1:37:44.483 --> 1:37:47.120
Bring me that coffee, right now.

1:37:47.353 --> 1:37:48.521
Two sugars, Mike.

1:37:48.654 --> 1:37:51.223
I need two sugars
in that coffee.

1:37:51.357 --> 1:37:52.425
Mike.

1:37:52.558 --> 1:37:54.226
Two sugars, Mike.

1:37:54.393 --> 1:37:58.664
Hey, Mike! Mike! Mike!
Mike! Mike!

1:37:59.398 --> 1:38:00.499
Mike!

1:38:01.801 --> 1:38:02.601
Mike!

1:38:02.735 --> 1:38:05.072
Stop, I've got a backseat.

1:38:05.204 --> 1:38:07.440
Mike, get out here!

1:38:07.573 --> 1:38:09.742
I hope you're thinking of me
while kissing her.

1:38:10.242 --> 1:38:12.278
Kelsey, he's inexperienced.

1:38:12.411 --> 1:38:14.580
Don't trust him, he doesn't know
what he's doing.

1:38:15.082 --> 1:38:16.248
Mike!

1:38:17.483 --> 1:38:19.218
Can I at least join?

1:38:21.454 --> 1:38:24.124
Mike. Mike, I saw that smile.

1:38:24.256 --> 1:38:26.126
You, me, Janice, Kelsey.

1:38:26.258 --> 1:38:27.693
We've all had the thought, like.

1:38:27.827 --> 1:38:30.830
I swear, Mike, Janice will be
a lot more into it.

1:38:30.964 --> 1:38:32.665
Bro, there's pancakes.

1:38:33.100 --> 1:38:35.035
Mike, give me the pancakes.

1:38:35.501 --> 1:38:37.938
Mike, bro. Bro, turn around.

1:38:38.071 --> 1:38:39.438
Get those pancakes for me.

1:38:39.906 --> 1:38:42.575
I gotta get up in like two
hours.

1:38:42.708 --> 1:38:43.609
Mike!

1:38:44.276 --> 1:38:45.411
Mike, Mike!

1:38:46.679 --> 1:38:47.580
Mike!

1:38:49.415 --> 1:38:50.516
Mike!

1:38:51.350 --> 1:38:52.551
Mike!

1:39:48.875 --> 1:39:50.409
<i>Quick, hurry.</i>

1:39:50.543 --> 1:39:51.677
<i>I'm gonna fill her up, okay?</i>

1:39:51.811 --> 1:39:53.146
Oh, the only way
to do it, right?

1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:54.814
We're not shy in this family.

1:39:54.948 --> 1:39:56.315
Mm-hm.

1:39:59.152 --> 1:40:00.553
Honey, should we call the house?

1:40:00.686 --> 1:40:02.421
- Why?
- Just to check in...

1:40:02.555 --> 1:40:03.522
Whoa, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

1:40:03.656 --> 1:40:04.824
- It's fine.
- What?

1:40:04.958 --> 1:40:06.026
He's fine.

1:40:06.625 --> 1:40:08.028
I hope no one has their feet on
my coffee table, I know that.

1:40:08.161 --> 1:40:11.397
Mm. Sweetheart, relax.
It's Michael.

1:40:14.700 --> 1:40:16.368
What could possibly
be going wrong?

1:40:16.502 --> 1:40:18.504
Seriously?
