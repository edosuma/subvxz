38:47.880 --> 38:49.540
What?

38:49.540 --> 38:52.380
All over the world, people can't
be with the people they love

38:52.380 --> 38:55.750
because of stupid laws and
stupid life and stupid death.

38:55.750 --> 38:59.960
And so I see where
my aggressive avoidance of you

38:59.960 --> 39:03.170
might come across
as ever so slightly petulant.

39:03.170 --> 39:06.380
But I still wish
that you would apologize.

39:06.380 --> 39:08.500
I just need you to see
that what you did was wrong.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.210
Maggie, April kissed me.
That wasn't --
No. I get that.

39:11.210 --> 39:12.750
And I am not mad
about that!

39:12.750 --> 39:14.710
I am mad
because you didn't tell me!

39:14.710 --> 39:16.880
I'm mad that you
thought I couldn't handle it!

39:16.880 --> 39:19.170
Because my whole life, people
have been talking over me

39:19.170 --> 39:21.210
and talking down to me

39:21.210 --> 39:23.000
and assuming that just because
I'm a little awkward

39:23.000 --> 39:24.960
and...and...goofy,

39:24.960 --> 39:27.330
that I can't handle
simple information!

39:27.330 --> 39:29.080
That's not
what I was doing --

39:29.080 --> 39:30.960
Do you think I can't see
that what you and April had

39:30.960 --> 39:32.210
was big and complicated?

39:32.210 --> 39:33.670
I mean, do you think you need
to protect me from that?

39:33.670 --> 39:36.330
I wasn't protecting you.
I was protecting April.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.880
I was probably protecting
myself, honestly, from this.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.000
From --
From all of this.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.120
Maggie, you think of yourself
as this goofy underdog.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.830
I mean,
that's an old idea.

39:45.830 --> 39:47.880
You're beautiful.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.040
You're brilliant.
You're powerful.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.040
You have all the power here.
I'm over here sunk.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.460
And you keep showing me
how capable you are

39:53.460 --> 39:54.830
of just walking away.

39:54.830 --> 39:57.580
You have all these reasons --
over and over --

39:57.580 --> 39:59.880
reasons to resist us, reasons
why we can't be together.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.920
First it's April,
and then it's what, our parents?

40:01.920 --> 40:03.250
Then it's the fact
that we all work together.

40:03.250 --> 40:04.040
Now it's this.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.750
It's just another thing,

40:05.750 --> 40:08.080
one moment I had with April when
I was trying to be her friend.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.080
And now
you're convinced again

40:10.080 --> 40:12.120
that you can just walk away
again and again.
