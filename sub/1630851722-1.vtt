any minute.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.022
It only takes a second
for something to go wrong,

09:50.089 --> 09:51.891
and you only have a second
to fix it.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.961
<i>I fly about eight to ten feet</i>
<i>off the ground,</i>

40:57.521 --> 40:59.590
<i>We are on top of the world.</i>

40:59.657 --> 41:01.225
We can take this thing
all the way.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.760
Lia, this was a tight one.

41:02.827 --> 41:04.195
I'm not disappointed, Phil.

41:04.261 --> 41:06.597
Everybody did their very best,

41:06.664 --> 41:08.866
and I couldn't ask
for better team members.

41:08.933 --> 41:09.567
(speaks Hawaiian)

41:09.633 --> 41:10.801
I was looking at my teammates.

41:10.868 --> 41:11.802
<i>Everybody was so positive.</i>

41:11.869 --> 41:12.970
<i>So, for the next challenge,</i>

41:13.037 --> 41:14.872
we stay together,
and it'll get done.

41:14.939 --> 41:16.407
KEOGHAN:
Sarah, well done.

41:16.473 --> 41:18.275
$12,000 goes to you
and your team.

41:18.342 --> 41:21.011
-That's $2,000 each.
-(cheering, whooping)

41:21.078 --> 41:23.681
-ELIZABETH: Go, Sarah.
-Congratulations, Sarah.

41:23.747 --> 41:26.083
-Nice work.
-And the Badge of Honor
from Murph. That's the first.

41:26.150 --> 41:29.620
-Yeah.
-Savage Crew up one-zero.
Dirty Hands, it ain't over.

41:29.687 --> 41:32.089
-It ain't, it's just begun.
-KEOGHAN: Yes, it has.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.390
You're standing
next to teammates

41:33.457 --> 41:36.460
who are the best of
the best in their trade.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.598
<i>Scrappy,</i>
<i>highly-motivated workers...</i>

41:40.664 --> 41:41.899
Dirty Hands!

41:43.968 --> 41:45.803
<i>-win the team competition.</i>
-KELSY: You okay?

41:45.870 --> 41:48.806
<i>Remember, the first team</i>
<i>to win five Badges of Honor...</i>

41:48.873 --> 41:50.274
(cheering)

41:50.341 --> 41:53.744
...gets that cash
bonus prize of $60,000.

41:53.811 --> 41:55.646
(cheering, whooping)

41:55.713 --> 41:59.450
<i>KEOGHAN:</i>
<i>And then, there's</i>
<i>the individual competition.</i>

41:59.516 --> 42:01.352
<i>A head-to-head battle.</i>

42:01.418 --> 42:02.720
<i>ALFIE:</i>
<i>I woke up with one purpose only</i>

42:02.786 --> 42:05.022
-Fire coming.
-To win.

42:05.089 --> 42:09.159
<i>KEOGHAN:</i>
<i>You'll have to rely</i>
<i>on your strength...</i>

42:09.226 --> 42:11.829
<i>endurance, life skills...</i>

42:11.896 --> 42:13.564
<i>KALIMBA:</i>
<i>I have fought fires</i>
<i>where the elevator is out,</i>

42:13.631 --> 42:15.232
<i>but if people's lives</i>
<i>are in danger,</i>

42:15.299 --> 42:16.667
you just have to keep on moving.

42:16.734 --> 42:18.736
-TAK: Push it!
<i>-KEOGHAN: And most of all...</i>

42:18.802 --> 42:20.371
<i>mental toughness.</i>

42:20.437 --> 42:22.172
(all shouting)

42:22.239 --> 42:23.574
-KEOGHAN: This is gonna
be close.
-JEROME: What's happening?

42:23.641 --> 42:25.609
Go down there and get that one
that's not turning!

42:25.676 --> 42:28.112
<i>-KEOGHAN: In the end...</i>
-(yelling)

42:28.178 --> 42:30.114
<i>...only one of you</i>
<i>will survive....</i>

42:30.180 --> 42:32.249
Oh! Got to be careful
he doesn't flip this.

42:32.316 --> 42:34.652
<i>...win $200,000...</i>

42:34.718 --> 42:36.253
ELIZABETH:
This one's for
all the outcasts, guys.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.155
-QUINCEY: Oh...
-ELIZABETH: Go, go, go, go!

42:38.222 --> 42:42.559
<i>...and be crowned</i>
Tough As Nails<i> champion.</i>

42:42.626 --> 42:44.895
How about a big round
of applause for Murph?

42:44.962 --> 42:46.664
(cheering)

42:46.730 --> 42:49.733
KEOGHAN: 22 years
serving in the military.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.001
Murph, it's been
an honor to have you here.

42:51.068 --> 42:52.303
You, too, Phil,
thank you for having me.

42:52.369 --> 42:54.605
All right, you guys,
we'll see you back

42:54.672 --> 42:56.006
for the next team challenge.

42:56.073 --> 42:57.341
MIKE:
You guys did not quit.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.109
SARAH:
Good hustle, good hustle, man.

42:59.176 --> 43:01.178
QUINCEY: Oh, man.
What a great time today.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.681
HANGER: I don't know about
you guys, but I'm hungry.

43:03.747 --> 43:05.382
-KELSY: Uh-huh.
-JEROME: Crab legs on you guys?

43:05.449 --> 43:06.483
