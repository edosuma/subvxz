merge for long periods of time in

09:12.600 --> 09:16.620
recovery janna me but those are cases of

09:14.610 --> 09:18.209
extreme cold when they're trapped under

09:16.620 --> 09:20.399
the ice the victims are always young and

09:18.209 --> 09:23.759
in top physical condition in these

11:06.840 --> 11:09.320
it'll be fun

11:21.580 --> 11:28.360
do you know about shunting can

11:26.410 --> 11:29.890
involuntary response basically what the

11:28.360 --> 11:32.470
brain does when it's deprived of oxygen

11:29.890 --> 11:34.600
it shuts down what's not necessary to

11:32.470 --> 11:36.700
keep the organism alive if you didn't

11:34.600 --> 11:38.410
need your sense of taste or smell the

11:36.700 --> 11:40.330
brain will shut them off it stopped

11:38.410 --> 11:42.190
pumping blood to the extremities and in

11:40.330 --> 11:44.140
the end the brain will abandon the heart

11:42.190 --> 11:46.450
to preserve itself you sound like a

11:44.140 --> 11:48.880
doctor no I'm just interested in the

11:46.450 --> 11:51.160
area so what happened to your patient

17:38.130 --> 17:43.860
your interest in this area surprises me

17:40.590 --> 17:47.160
why you're interested yeah it's my field

17:43.860 --> 17:49.260
John I pulled people out of all kinds of

17:47.160 --> 17:51.570
water I've seen them live and

17:49.260 --> 17:53.310
unfortunately I've seen a few die but I

17:51.570 --> 17:54.870
have never seen anyone under water for

17:53.310 --> 17:56.700
anywhere near 20 minutes and lived to

17:54.870 --> 17:58.800
tell about it and this guy comes out of

17:56.700 --> 18:02.100
it like it was a joy ride maybe it was

17:58.800 --> 18:05.220
leaving maybe a what it might have been

18:02.100 --> 18:06.660
an experience that led to joy I've heard

18:05.220 --> 18:09.150
of the joy of cooking but the joy of

18:06.660 --> 18:10.860
dying come on Sean the fundamental fact

18:09.150 --> 18:13.170
is he underwent a physical experience

18:10.860 --> 18:15.420
that he'd never felt before a great

18:13.170 --> 18:18.900
trauma a shock in its most extreme form

18:15.420 --> 18:20.790
which if you have an open mind is

18:18.900 --> 18:23.190
exactly what happens when you're born

18:20.790 --> 18:24.630
you leave one physical environment the

18:23.190 --> 18:26.760
only physical environment you've ever

18:24.630 --> 18:30.390
known and enter into a completely

18:26.760 --> 18:33.300
different physical world except for some

18:30.390 --> 18:37.170
unknown reason this man Steve riser he

18:33.300 --> 18:39.780
was forced or he chose to return and you

18:37.170 --> 18:41.460
think that's why he was smiling I think

18:39.780 --> 18:43.680
he was put in a physical place where his

18:41.460 --> 18:46.920
brain had no other choice but to accept

18:43.680 --> 18:48.780
its new environment to redefine all the

18:46.920 --> 18:51.210
sensations the body was feeling to

18:48.780 --> 18:53.670
convert the remaining energy and direct

18:51.210 --> 18:56.250
it into one single channel mind over

18:53.670 --> 18:58.440
matter consciously or unconsciously what

18:56.250 --> 19:00.780
the mind truly controlled and Steve

18:58.440 --> 19:02.940
riser he could be a key to a major

19:00.780 --> 19:05.700
breakthrough he was under water for 20

19:02.940 --> 19:09.040
minutes if we could find out how think

19:05.700 --> 19:13.250
of what that could do for us

19:09.040 --> 19:13.250
[Music]

19:15.940 --> 19:24.909
all right this is our training area I

19:22.629 --> 19:27.220
don't think this is how to find a man is

19:24.909 --> 19:32.350
my dream the point of this exercise is

19:27.220 --> 19:35.710
not mine right that's fine mr.

19:32.350 --> 19:38.559
interesting with symptoms primers okay

19:35.710 --> 19:40.870
so how do we do that black not raining

19:38.559 --> 19:47.690
remember how we missed you on the fan

19:40.870 --> 19:52.700
