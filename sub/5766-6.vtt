WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:04.360
ALICIA:
Arthur Gibson, 52.
Worked as a sales manager

00:04.400 --> 00:06.038
for an industrial
machinery manufacturer.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.395
Married?
No. Divorced.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.362
Next. We need someone
at our table.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.037
Deborah Barber, 38.
Next.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.172
Why?

00:13.210 --> 00:15.235
Not sympathetic enough.
Really?

00:15.280 --> 00:16.577
Is there a weight limit
on sympathy?

00:16.610 --> 00:17.770
Uh, Maureen Fenton.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.710
_ Housewife. _
Divorced and remarried.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.172
One daughter, 18.

00:21.220 --> 00:23.245
How did she do it?
Handgun.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.042
Killed her husband,
then herself.

00:25.090 --> 00:26.284
What's the daughter look like?

00:29.860 --> 00:31.088
She signed on
to the class action?

00:31.130 --> 00:32.427
One of the first.

00:32.460 --> 00:33.757
How will she do on the stand?

00:33.800 --> 00:35.358
Good.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.062
Then that's our test case.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.660
Make sure she wears the cross.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.260
But I thought Mr. Yates
was doing it.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.733
We thought so, too,
but he got cold feet.

00:45.770 --> 00:48.534
We know this is very
last minute, Caitlin,

00:48.580 --> 00:50.548
but we think
MRG Pharmaceuticals

00:50.580 --> 00:52.741
is ready to settle.

00:52.780 --> 00:55.749
We just need a strong test
case to motivate them.

00:55.780 --> 00:58.681
IfI lose,
the others can't sue, right?

00:58.720 --> 01:01.655
Well, they can sue,
but it will be harder.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.282
But I'll have to be
on the stand?

01:05.130 --> 01:07.826
It's a good case, Caitlin.
Really good.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.760
And we need to make sure

01:09.800 --> 01:13.065
they never make an
antidepressant like that again.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.767
Sometimes I wonder if God
forgives her, you know?

01:18.810 --> 01:21.529
I have these nightmares

01:21.580 --> 01:23.639
of Mom not in heaven.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.376
Your mom didn't
do this, Caitlin.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.819
The pills did.

01:27.850 --> 01:29.886
You need to remember that.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.888
I know.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.559
Thank you.

01:34.590 --> 01:37.150
* Oh, say

01:37.190 --> 01:40.523
* Can you see

01:40.560 --> 01:42.460
* By the dawn's early light...

01:42.500 --> 01:44.388
Of course,
she has perfect pitch.

01:44.430 --> 01:45.761
And this is bad, how?

01:45.800 --> 01:47.131
It's at the end.

01:47.170 --> 01:48.865
She gives ten percent
to her church.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.834
She works at a food
kitchen once a month.

01:50.870 --> 01:52.770
And she volunteers
at her kids' school.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.698
Private school?
No, public.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.776
She lives frugally,
quietly.

01:56.810 --> 01:58.141
There were no
complaints

01:58.180 --> 01:59.875
from neighbors,
staff, or coworkers.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.615
So she's a saint?

02:01.650 --> 02:02.742
For Chicago
or the world?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.815
There are no saints.

02:04.850 --> 02:06.488
The smaller the sin,

02:06.520 --> 02:08.579
the larger you have
to make the magnifying glass.

02:08.620 --> 02:09.780
(fast forwarding video)
There.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.253
That's her husband.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.597
Yeah, he's white,
we know.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.566
This is not the South.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.161
With some issues,
everywhere's the South.

02:22.970 --> 02:23.834
I'll think about it.

02:27.310 --> 02:28.868
She's good.

02:28.910 --> 02:30.571
No paper trail.

02:30.610 --> 02:32.840
Keeps her distance
from the machine.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.347
No money I could find.

02:34.380 --> 02:35.813
Nothing to get a foothold.

02:35.850 --> 02:39.286
Hmm. My staff wants me to go
after the miscegenation vote.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.359
Her white husband.

02:41.390 --> 02:43.529
Oh, yeah.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.585
In some neighborhoods,
that works.

02:45.630 --> 02:47.188
I could work up
some flyers.

02:47.230 --> 02:48.026
What else?

02:48.060 --> 02:50.460
I'm looking into
some clinic visits.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.333
There might be
an abortion.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.361
What? Did she film it?

02:55.400 --> 02:58.267
No. We're still
checking it out.

02:58.310 --> 02:59.504
I am in a meeting.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.337
You're not gonna
like this.

03:01.380 --> 03:04.508
I was tracking a "Q and A" that
Wendy did up at Albany Park.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.677
You know, getting some
shots of people waiting,

03:06.720 --> 03:09.883
trying to put together an
idiot supporter montage.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.785
(people cheering)

03:11.820 --> 03:13.959
Whoo! Wendy!

03:13.990 --> 03:16.220
MOODY:
So what do you guys
like about her?

03:16.260 --> 03:17.887
She just makes a lot of sense.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.852
You know, it-it's different.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.789
With Obama now,
politics is cool again.

03:22.830 --> 03:25.719
No. No, no, no.

03:35.940 --> 03:38.602
What's the case?

03:38.650 --> 03:39.878
No case.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.740
It's the folder
I stole from your car.

03:41.780 --> 03:43.589
Ah. Yeah.

03:43.620 --> 03:44.939
After you trashed it.

03:44.990 --> 03:48.949
So you, uh...
you finding a lot in there?

03:48.990 --> 03:50.651
Some.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.692
You take a lot of notes.

03:55.760 --> 04:00.959
Hey, do you know, uh,
what I-LeGaL is?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.037
It's the Illinois Lesbian & Gay
Law Association.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.402
They just rated
Chicago law firms

04:06.440 --> 04:09.705
on their diversity
in hiring gays and lesbians,

04:09.750 --> 04:11.377
and transgenders and...
whatever.

04:11.410 --> 04:16.279
Aanay, Lockhart/Gardner & Bond
did not do well,

04:16.320 --> 04:22.008
even though I know for a fact
that we have gay associates

04:22.060 --> 04:24.756
who just aren't acknowledging
that they're gay.

04:24.790 --> 04:28.294
Now, in this day and age,
why would someone

04:28.330 --> 04:31.959
not be up-front about
their sexual orientation?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.389
Are you coming out?

04:37.440 --> 04:39.499
You know the theory
that I work under?

04:39.540 --> 04:42.008
No.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.771
It's better not to keep secrets

04:45.810 --> 04:48.313
'cause then people
don't go looking.

04:52.090 --> 04:54.285
All right.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.962
WOMAN:
Hello.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.820
Hi. It's me.

05:04.870 --> 05:06.497
Yeah.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.962
Uh, we need to talk.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.467
No, I agree that's fantastic.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.102
Okay.

05:12.140 --> 05:15.029
MRG Pharmaceuticals just
fired their team this weekend.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.502
Alicia!

05:16.550 --> 05:17.505
What,
their jury consultants?

05:17.550 --> 05:19.518
Their everything.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.711
Our opponents just fired
their lawyers;

05:21.750 --> 05:23.513
they're going with a firm
from New York.

05:23.550 --> 05:24.881
They're scrambling.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.114
Who did they get?

05:26.150 --> 05:27.981
We don't know yet;
we're trying to find out.

05:28.020 --> 05:28.816
VIRGINIA:
It's probably Bernstein, Meyers.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.725
They won that asbestos suit
last year.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.354
Bring them on. They'll look
like an army against us.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.027
We'll have three women
at the plaintiff's table;

05:35.060 --> 05:36.994
they'll have a half-dozen
out-of-towners.

05:37.030 --> 05:38.861
It'll be David and Goliath
writ large,

05:38.900 --> 05:40.561
so I want you
to handle voir dire.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.567
Me?

05:41.600 --> 05:42.567
Yes.
Are you ready?

05:42.610 --> 05:43.736
I am. Yes.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.635
Um, Diane, as your
jury consultant...

05:45.670 --> 05:47.035
Don't worry, if they're
bringing in New York,

05:47.080 --> 05:49.640
we need to play up
our recognizability in Chicago.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.875
The New Yorkers will object,
but let them.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.013
They'll look like killjoys.

05:53.050 --> 05:55.644
Diane, um...
I just need a minute.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.886
And a cup of coffee.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.911
(laughs)
Okay. Don't be late.

06:01.860 --> 06:03.828
Hey.

06:03.860 --> 06:05.623
You'll be good.

06:05.660 --> 06:07.127
$30 to 40 million--

06:07.160 --> 06:09.094
this could turn everything
around for the firm.

06:09.130 --> 06:10.961
Not to put too much
pressure on you.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.434
(chuckles)

06:19.110 --> 06:21.874
Can I have a regular coffee,
please.

06:25.810 --> 06:27.641
Thank you.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.981
Oh, thank you.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.850
Doors are heavy.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.128
Yeah.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.627
Uh-oh.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.126
What?

06:44.170 --> 06:46.832
Oh. My bus pass.

06:46.870 --> 06:49.168
I must have dropped it.
I keep my ID with it.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.930
I must have dropped it
by the coffee cart.

06:51.970 --> 06:54.006
Would you mind?

06:54.040 --> 06:56.133
Yeah. Sure.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.000
By the coffee cart?

06:58.050 --> 07:00.143
Yeah, I think... I mean, I was
by the bench for a minute,

07:00.180 --> 07:01.579
but I think it's by
the coffee cart.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.986
Thank you so much.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.750
What are we waiting on,
Ms. Lockhart?

07:12.800 --> 07:15.598
Uh, my co-counsel is
just outside, Your Honor.

07:15.630 --> 07:17.063
She is handling voir dire

07:17.100 --> 07:18.567
and she should be here
any moment.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.091
Is the defense ready
for voir dire?

07:21.140 --> 07:22.232
Certainly, Your Honor.

07:22.270 --> 07:24.238
Then let's go.

07:24.270 --> 07:25.703
Mr. Canning.

07:25.740 --> 07:27.469
Good morning.

07:27.510 --> 07:30.570
First of all, I want to
thank you for your service.

07:30.610 --> 07:35.240
And I probably need
to explain a few things.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.111
What were you doing?

07:37.150 --> 07:39.118
I'm sorry.
There was a...

07:39.150 --> 07:41.789
Good morning,
Mrs. Florrick.

07:41.820 --> 07:44.618
I hope you don't mind we,
uh, started without you.

07:44.660 --> 07:48.198
Now, uh, before I ask you
just a few questions,

07:48.230 --> 07:49.993
I-I think I probably
owe you an explanation.

07:50.030 --> 07:53.261
I suffer from a condition,

07:53.300 --> 07:54.938
tardive dyskinesia.

07:54.970 --> 07:56.608
Which is really,
it's just a funny word

07:56.640 --> 07:58.267
for a neurological disorder.

07:58.310 --> 08:02.201
And it makes me do this.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.707
And... this. And...

08:03.750 --> 08:04.808
Bah...

08:04.850 --> 08:05.839
(jurors chuckle)

08:05.880 --> 08:08.747
But, uh...
Uh-oh.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.044
if you just look at me long
enough, you get used to it.

08:11.090 --> 08:14.981
So, um... you know, feel free
to look, and H won't mind.

08:15.020 --> 08:19.753
Now the good news is...
these pills.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.722
I-I, um, take these
every few hours,

08:21.760 --> 08:23.864
and-and they don't make
the symptoms

08:23.900 --> 08:25.527
disappear completely,
but they do diminish...

08:25.570 --> 08:26.559
Objection.

08:27.770 --> 08:29.169
JUDGE PARKS:
Approach the bench.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.736
Your Honor,
defense counsel

08:30.770 --> 08:32.874
is using voir dire
to argue his case.

08:32.910 --> 08:35.276
You'll have to
explain that to me.

08:35.310 --> 08:37.107
This whole case hinges
on a drug--

08:37.150 --> 08:39.038
whether in fact
an antidepressant drug

08:39.080 --> 08:42.049
your client manufactured made
people want to kill themselves.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.241
Your Honor, I'm simply
trying to make sure

08:44.290 --> 08:47.259
that my symptoms
won't be a distraction.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.724
Part of my voir dire is to
discover who will have problems

08:49.760 --> 08:51.125
with my condition,
and who will not.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.184
Makes sense to me,
Mrs. Florrick.

08:52.230 --> 08:55.290
Overruled.

08:55.330 --> 08:57.867
As I was saying, I don't want my
symptoms to be a distraction,

08:57.900 --> 09:00.266
but I have to tell you
that they do intensify

09:00.300 --> 09:01.665
when I become perplexed,
and I'm-I'm just,

09:01.700 --> 09:03.565
I'm really transparent that way.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.965
So, for example, I don't want
you to be distracted

09:06.010 --> 09:07.705
when my opponents
are questioning...

09:07.740 --> 09:08.707
Objection.

09:08.740 --> 09:12.574
So, are we going to have
a trial at some point?

09:12.620 --> 09:15.817
Your Honor, Mr. Canning
is trying, yet again,

09:15.850 --> 09:17.215
to taint this jury.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.718
How? I was helping you
this time.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.149
I just don't want my movements
to be a distraction.

09:22.190 --> 09:24.351
No, sir, you were guaranteeing
that the jury will be

09:24.390 --> 09:27.598
watching you throughout our
testimony to see how you react.

09:27.630 --> 09:32.169
My God, the cynicism here
is breathtaking.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.792
Have you thought maybe you might

09:33.840 --> 09:35.193
have a problem
with disabled people?

09:35.240 --> 09:36.730
Your Honor!

09:36.770 --> 09:38.203
All right, all right.
Mr. Canning, let's try

09:38.240 --> 09:40.970
to keep the pained outrage
to a minimum here.

09:41.010 --> 09:43.149
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
It's just a sore point with me.

09:43.180 --> 09:46.809
Mrs. Florrick,
I understand your point,

09:46.850 --> 09:49.910
but I think Mr. Canning needs
to inoculate the jury to his...

09:49.950 --> 09:51.815
What is the proper word?

09:51.850 --> 09:52.817
Condition.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.918
Condition.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.849
So again, overruled.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.699
Did you have any luck
finding my bus pass?

10:00.730 --> 10:05.064
'Cause my driver might need it
if the limo won't start.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.763
Okay, we just
turned into Goliath.

10:10.870 --> 10:13.839
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

10:26.420 --> 10:28.786
Hey, Johnny, you got a fast one?

10:28.820 --> 10:30.253
I need to get
out of here by 3:00.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.087
Thanks.

10:32.130 --> 10:33.427
Oh, yeah. Of course
it's the dog. As usual...

10:33.460 --> 10:34.427
KALIN DA:
Hey, Donna.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.451
What's up?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.706
You're talking
to somebody.

10:42.740 --> 10:45.163
I'm talking to somebody?
I'm talking to a lot of people.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.337
Somebody from my office.
An investigator named Blake?

10:47.380 --> 10:50.838
"Indecent exposure.
Public masturbation."

10:50.880 --> 10:53.440
Look. I need you
to stop talking.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.175
Kalinda. Four months,

10:55.220 --> 10:57.313
and this is what you
come to talk to me about?

10:57.350 --> 10:59.113
How are you?

10:59.150 --> 11:00.310
Oh, yeah.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.158
Humanitarian
of the Year.

11:03.190 --> 11:06.648
Mr. Bay. Are any of you Mr. Bay?

11:07.930 --> 11:09.192
Mr. Bay? I'm Donna.

11:09.230 --> 11:10.925
I'm from the Public Defender's
Office.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.188
I'm here to defend you
on charges of indecency,

11:13.240 --> 11:15.231
masturbating in a public park.

11:15.270 --> 11:17.261
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

11:17.310 --> 11:19.232
Are you masturbating right now?

11:19.270 --> 11:21.204
Don't do that.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.902
Get your hands out of
your pockets, don't say a word.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.373
Who do you have for us
today, Ms. Seabrook?

11:26.410 --> 11:28.241
An innocent man, Your Honor.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.076
I'm sure.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.985
Mr. Raymond Bay,
an upstanding citizen,

11:31.020 --> 11:33.909
who was arrested in Berger Park
with his hands in his pockets,

11:33.960 --> 11:36.087
supposedly making,
as the arrest report states,

11:36.120 --> 11:37.951
"the motions of masturbation."

11:37.990 --> 11:39.924
But as we all know,
the weather

11:39.960 --> 11:42.121
along the shore last night
was unseasonably cold.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.822
Mr. Bay was doing nothing more
than what any of us would do,

11:44.870 --> 11:46.428
which was warming
his shivering,

11:46.470 --> 11:48.961
and therefore, shaking hands
in his pockets.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.306
Let this one go, Counselor.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.001
Time served.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.234
Next!
(bangs gavel)

11:55.280 --> 11:57.475
You're welcome.

11:59.180 --> 12:01.171
You could make a lot
of money at a big firm.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.212
Why? When I meet so many
interesting people here.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.908
Everything's fine.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.211
I didn't talk to anybody.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.852
I didn't tell
anybody your secrets.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.949
And if this guy
approaches me...
Blake.

12:14.430 --> 12:17.024
I won't tell him how
heartless you can be,

12:17.070 --> 12:19.220
how insensitive,

12:19.270 --> 12:22.262
how self-preservation is
your number one concern,

12:22.300 --> 12:25.838
and after four months,

12:25.870 --> 12:27.178
you can barely say hello.

12:27.210 --> 12:29.269
I won't tell him
any of that, okay?

12:36.120 --> 12:38.543
VIRGINIA: My sense is,
we got the jury we wanted,

12:38.590 --> 12:41.514
but the... handicap

12:41.560 --> 12:44.120
of the opposing
counsel has undercut

12:44.160 --> 12:45.184
my earlier assumptions.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.379
Meaning?

12:46.430 --> 12:48.955
He's co-opted our jury.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.194
I don't get it.

12:50.230 --> 12:51.561
He's... handicapped?

12:51.600 --> 12:53.033
DIANE:
And he's using it.

12:53.070 --> 12:54.560
He's making
the pharmaceutical company

12:54.600 --> 12:55.567
look like the good guy.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.567
But the medical testimony

12:56.600 --> 12:57.567
will prove otherwise.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.929
We still have

12:58.970 --> 13:00.301
a slam-dunk here.

13:00.340 --> 13:01.307
Yeah, we're acting like

13:01.340 --> 13:02.238
we're the ones on the run here.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.406
Talk to the doctors,

13:03.450 --> 13:05.202
get them ready for
some tough cross.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.458
I'm trying to
figure out...

13:17.490 --> 13:19.355
how to broach
this one.

13:19.390 --> 13:21.199
Okay.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.225
Why don't you give me
a subject line?

13:28.400 --> 13:31.198
Grace, your daughter.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.073
She attended a
Wendy Scott-Carr speech,

13:34.110 --> 13:37.045
and spoke out for her.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.240
We have it on tape.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.872
But not for public
consumption.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.273
One of our trackers
caught it.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.049
One of our trackers?

13:43.090 --> 13:45.308
Yes. I have
to keeps tabs.

13:45.350 --> 13:46.487
(sighs)

13:46.520 --> 13:48.351
Well, what did she say?

13:48.390 --> 13:50.358
Oh, Wendy's makes
so much sense.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.529
How there's so much
corruption here.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.448
I think she meant Chicago.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.320
How much she likes her.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.225
I'm paraphrasing,
but succinctly.

14:01.070 --> 14:03.106
Okay, I will talk to her.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.301
Thank you.

14:05.340 --> 14:08.400
And I'm sorry to have
to bring this to you.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.977
I promise, next time,

14:11.010 --> 14:12.307
I'll bring something good.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.188
Elvatyl is a selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.983
And this is
the antidepressant drug

14:24.030 --> 14:26.351
manufactured by the defendant?

14:26.390 --> 14:28.494
Yes. It controls depression
by stopping the brain

14:28.530 --> 14:31.090
from reabsorbing serotonin.
(chair squeaking, thumping)

14:31.130 --> 14:33.963
I see. Now, let
me ask you this.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.092
In your latest
clinical trial,

14:35.140 --> 14:36.664
you found that people

14:36.700 --> 14:40.477
taking Elvatyl
were three times as likely...

14:46.310 --> 14:47.345
Sorry.

14:47.380 --> 14:51.146
They were three times as likely
to commit suicide

14:51.190 --> 14:52.487
as those taking sugar pills.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.283
Is that correct?
Yes, it IS.

14:54.320 --> 14:59.189
Uh, it appears that the
serotonin transporter gene 5-H'l'l'

14:59.230 --> 15:02.449
increases the synaptic
serotonin levels.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.219
And how would you describe that
in layman's term?

15:05.270 --> 15:06.259
In layman's terms?

15:06.300 --> 15:07.597
Well, as
a threshold matter,

15:07.640 --> 15:11.565
the mechanism
for SSRI inhibition

15:11.610 --> 15:14.078
is poorly understood.

15:14.110 --> 15:17.477
Think of it as a
train switchyard,

15:17.510 --> 15:19.273
and the SSRI is
the conductor,

15:19.310 --> 15:22.211
with the track
the absorption rate,

15:22.250 --> 15:26.448
and the 5-H'l'l' gene
as the coal.

15:27.490 --> 15:29.082
Thank you.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.428
No further questions.

15:30.460 --> 15:33.156
JUDGE PA_RKS:
Mr. Canning.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.398
Thank you.

15:37.430 --> 15:41.332
Doctor... (sniffs)

15:41.370 --> 15:43.463
talk to me about sex.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.128
About sex?

15:46.170 --> 15:47.307
CANNING:
Yeah.

15:47.340 --> 15:48.307
This stuff
you're talking about--

15:48.340 --> 15:50.308
this, uh, SSRL...

15:50.350 --> 15:52.978
DOCTOR:
SSRL
CAl\ll'|I\lIING:

15:53.020 --> 15:55.443
Um, how does it affect
a person's sex life?

15:55.480 --> 15:58.313
Well, I'm not sure
I understand the question.

15:58.350 --> 16:00.284
Well, if... for example, if
there were feelings of jealousy,

16:00.320 --> 16:03.528
this drug would intensify them,
correct?

16:03.560 --> 16:05.687
Yes, I suppose so. Mm-hmm.

16:05.730 --> 16:07.994
_ But it couldn't create
jealousy out of nowhere.

16:08.030 --> 16:09.998
I mean, there
would have to be

16:10.030 --> 16:12.498
a reason for such
jealousy to eXIst.

16:12.530 --> 16:14.361
Objection. Beyond the scope.
Sustained.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.461
Guess we can dodge that question
for the moment.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.375
All right, Doctor.

16:20.410 --> 16:24.403
Getting back to SSRL's effect
on a person's sex life...

16:25.550 --> 16:27.245
Get lost.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.454
So what is it?

16:33.490 --> 16:34.684
The abortion?

16:34.720 --> 16:36.256
No.

16:36.290 --> 16:38.429
But I know why she was
going to the doctor.

16:39.430 --> 16:40.658
Breast augmentation.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.520
(chuckles)

16:42.560 --> 16:44.198
You're kidding me.

16:44.230 --> 16:45.367
(laughing):
No.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.038
Four visits over two months.

16:47.070 --> 16:50.528
So Mother_ Teresa
got breast implants.

16:50.570 --> 16:52.538
Does that humanize her or not?

16:52.570 --> 16:53.400
I would say not.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.579
I would say you're right.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.669
She cares about the poor,
and yet...

16:57.710 --> 16:59.268
How much did she spend?

16:59.310 --> 17:01.312
Over two months...

17:02.820 --> 17:04.788
$19,000.

17:04.820 --> 17:06.515
(whistles)

17:06.550 --> 17:08.450
It's Clinton's haircut.

17:08.490 --> 17:11.050
No, it's better
than Clinton's haircut.

17:11.090 --> 17:12.455
And yet...

17:12.490 --> 17:13.798
What?
The candidate.

17:13.830 --> 17:15.491
He won't go there.

17:15.530 --> 17:18.021
Since when did you care where
the candidate wanted to go?

17:19.200 --> 17:20.531
Give me that.

17:23.540 --> 17:27.135
(cell phone ringing)

17:27.180 --> 17:28.499
What do you want, Eli?

17:28.540 --> 17:29.768
You can just go to hell.

17:29.810 --> 17:31.573
Uh-huh.
And what have I done now?

17:31.610 --> 17:34.078
That was ours.
Go find your own.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.519
Eli, you're blathering.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.438
I'm just warning you--
stay the hell away!

17:37.490 --> 17:39.515
Okay, I'm going now.

17:42.590 --> 17:44.080
What does that do?

17:50.230 --> 17:52.221
(cell phone ringing)

17:55.600 --> 17:57.500
He's a Childs plant.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.565
ELI:
Mm-hmm. I've known for a week.

17:59.610 --> 18:02.374
Just waiting for
a chance to use.

18:02.410 --> 18:05.447
So, go have him
make a Xerox.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.879
(chuckles)

18:06.910 --> 18:09.572
That's what I like
about you, Eli.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.487
(clears throat)

18:13.520 --> 18:15.556
Sorry.

18:15.590 --> 18:18.582
Um, my mom was great.

18:18.630 --> 18:21.827
And there was this change
that came over her

18:21.860 --> 18:23.623
after she started
taking it.

18:23.670 --> 18:24.898
Elvatyl?

18:24.930 --> 18:26.625
CAITLIN:
Yeah. The doctor
prescribed it.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.491
I was going away to
college, and my mom...

18:29.540 --> 18:31.337
you know, empty
nest syndrome.

18:31.370 --> 18:33.201
DIANE:
Could you describe
the change?

18:33.240 --> 18:36.732
CAITLIN:
Within a day, she
became more depressed.

18:36.780 --> 18:38.748
She couldn't sleep.

18:38.780 --> 18:41.578
She had nightmares
that made her scream.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.815
It was horrible.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.909
Hi.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.611
Hello.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.810
Your stepdad had just
started a new job.

18:49.860 --> 18:52.158
Is that right?

18:52.190 --> 18:54.590
Yes. Um, at
Thurrell Interiors.

18:54.630 --> 18:56.222
He designed furniture?

18:57.270 --> 18:58.623
CAITLIN :
Yes.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.934
Couches and
fold-out beds.

19:00.970 --> 19:03.632
And he worked in a department
with all women?

19:04.710 --> 19:06.701
Yeah. Why?

19:06.740 --> 19:07.672
Oh, no reason. I just...

19:07.710 --> 19:10.440
I want to be clear on the facts.
That's all.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.711
11 employees-- all women--

19:13.750 --> 19:15.638
and your stepdad.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.410
CAITLIN:
Yes. He liked his job.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.418
CANNING:
He spend some late
nights there, did he?

19:20.460 --> 19:22.314
CAITLIN:
At his work? I guess.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.658
They were trying to get
out the spring catalogue.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.749
Well,
what I'm saying is,

19:26.790 --> 19:29.725
actually...

19:29.760 --> 19:33.639
This is a list
of items the police vouchered

19:33.670 --> 19:35.638
when they arrived
at your mom's house.

19:35.670 --> 19:37.729
I want you to do me a favor.

19:37.770 --> 19:40.671
I want you to read for me
item number seven.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.499
"A gym bag."

19:45.550 --> 19:48.713
"A bloody gym
bag," it says.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.913
And that was
your stepdad's.

19:51.950 --> 19:56.216
Uh, could... could you
read for me item seven-B?

20:01.760 --> 20:03.990
"Women's panties, black."

20:04.030 --> 20:05.588
CANNING:
Ah, that's good.

20:05.630 --> 20:07.530
And-and what does it say
in the parentheses here?

20:07.570 --> 20:09.788
"Small."

20:09.840 --> 20:12.001
"Small." That's good.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.508
Well, let me take that.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.978
Caitlin, what size
was your mom?

20:20.010 --> 20:21.443
CAITLIN:
What size?

20:21.480 --> 20:22.970
You mean, like, clothing?
CANNING: Yeah.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.386
I guess... a 12?

20:29.660 --> 20:33.391
12... 12 would be large,

20:33.430 --> 20:36.354
not... not the size
of these panties.

20:38.700 --> 20:39.997
It's all right.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.669
You don't have to answer.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.959
CANNING:
I-I do have to ask you
this question, though.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.331
Is it true that your mom
and your stepdad

20:48.380 --> 20:49.529
argued over a woman at work?

20:50.040 --> 20:50.972
No.

20:51.010 --> 20:52.477
A woman he was in love with?

20:52.510 --> 20:55.445
Objection. No foundation.
JUDGE PARKS:
Sustained.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.641
Who was much younger
and prettier than your mom?
Objection.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.385
JUDGE PARKS:
Mr. Canning, that's enough.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.324
CANNING:
My apologies, Your Honor.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.054
I have no
further questions.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.422
And, uh, I'm sorry
for your loss.

21:16.340 --> 21:18.001
We need to regroup.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.570
So how are we
doing today?

21:25.610 --> 21:28.511
Your office is... small.

21:28.550 --> 21:30.916
Yes. Small, but pure.

21:30.950 --> 21:32.884
So, in the third year,
do you get a window?

21:32.920 --> 21:34.319
Ah.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.581
Should I shut the door?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.359
No. No, it's bad enough
they think

21:39.390 --> 21:41.790
I'm going to flip back
to the defense.

21:41.830 --> 21:42.899
So what's up?

21:42.930 --> 21:44.625
What do you need?

21:44.670 --> 21:46.490
Why do you think
I need anything?

21:46.530 --> 21:47.792
Because you're Kalinda.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.831
My, uh...

21:49.870 --> 21:53.931
my usual sources
have dried up here,

21:53.980 --> 21:55.675
and... sorry.

21:55.710 --> 21:57.769
I thought maybe
you could help.

21:57.810 --> 21:59.641
It's a personal matter.

21:59.680 --> 22:03.480
It's a new investigator
from Baltimore-- Blake Calamar.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.350
Blake Calamar.

22:09.390 --> 22:10.857
Yeah.

22:10.890 --> 22:11.879
All right.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.591
And what do I get in return?

22:13.630 --> 22:15.757
Well, what do you want?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.859
(chuckles)

22:19.900 --> 22:21.094
Who was she?

22:21.140 --> 22:22.437
DIANE:
The woman who ran
out of court?

22:22.470 --> 22:23.937
An intern _at
Canning's firm.

22:23.970 --> 22:25.938
DERRICK:
Damn, if we could
undercut Canning

22:25.970 --> 22:27.835
by subpoenaing her...

22:27.880 --> 22:29.074
That's playing
on his battlefield.

22:29.110 --> 22:30.873
We need to pull him onto ours.

22:30.910 --> 22:31.877
Ours is the medicine.

22:31.910 --> 22:33.912
The problem with the medicine
is it's boring.

22:33.950 --> 22:35.042
DIANE:
But it's still the truth.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.638
WILL:
And the truth is boring.

22:36.680 --> 22:40.650
He's got soap opera, and
we've got genetic science.

22:40.690 --> 22:41.816
That's always been our case.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.713
No, that's our facts.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.752
Our case is what we
do with those facts.

22:45.790 --> 22:47.894
And right now,
our case is failing Caitlin.

22:47.930 --> 22:49.727
We need to make
medicme sexy.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.489
Yep.

22:51.530 --> 22:53.395
A lie always
beats the truth.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.032
Can adapt; it doesn't
have to be consistent.

22:55.070 --> 22:57.709
So we need to give the truth
the drama of a lie.

23:00.910 --> 23:02.775
Increased libido.

23:03.780 --> 23:05.475
(laughs)

23:05.510 --> 23:06.977
One of the side
effects of Elvatyl

23:07.010 --> 23:09.843
is it has a potential
increased libido in women.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.040
Good.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.842
We need to meet
our last expert Witness.

23:12.890 --> 23:13.959
Who is it?

23:13.990 --> 23:17.153
I'm sorry,
you want me to say what?

23:17.190 --> 23:20.523
One of the side effects you
noticed was an increased desire

23:20.560 --> 23:23.666
for sex in public places.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.122
Th...

23:25.170 --> 23:26.990
That's ludicrous.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.759
It's in your study, Doctor.

23:28.800 --> 23:29.937
No, it isn't.

23:29.970 --> 23:30.800

Subject 18--

23:30.840 --> 23:32.808
she mentioned it
in her trial interview.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.831
She was merely mentioning that
as an aside.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.973
Our trial interviewer quickly
brought her back to point.

23:37.010 --> 23:38.807
Yes, that was unfortunate.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.977
We also want you to discuss
the increased desire

23:41.020 --> 23:43.511
for oral and anal intercourse

23:43.550 --> 23:45.541
mentioned by Subject 35.

23:47.590 --> 23:49.512
Ms. Lockhart, this is...

23:49.560 --> 23:51.881
It's what we need, Doctor.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.818
It's what Caitlin needs to win.

23:53.860 --> 23:55.828
Well, I'm not a clown.

I'm not a performing
circus animal.

I'm a man of science.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.989
DIANE:
Suit yourself, Dr. Lawton.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.668
But you've only fulfilled half
your contract, and we'll be

24:04.710 --> 24:07.702
stopping payment as soon as
you board that elevator.

24:18.050 --> 24:19.847
Thank you, Doctor.

24:19.890 --> 24:22.984
Did you happen to videotape
any of your animal trials?

24:23.020 --> 24:25.227
Your most violent ones?

24:26.960 --> 24:28.723
I just wanted to
hear her speak.

24:28.760 --> 24:29.795
That's all.

24:29.830 --> 24:31.263
And I want you
to hear her speak,

24:31.300 --> 24:32.858
but you did
more than that.

24:32.900 --> 24:33.935
You spoke to someone.

24:33.970 --> 24:35.995
How do you know?

24:36.040 --> 24:37.962
Someone videotaped you.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.864
VVho?

24:41.910 --> 24:42.934
Are you angry at Dad?

24:42.980 --> 24:44.800
No.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.205
Somebody asked me a question,
and I answered them.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.045
It's a free country.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.015
Yes, thank you, Grace.

24:53.050 --> 24:54.881
You know
this will hurt Dad.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.980
Mom, she's really good.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.224
She really is.

24:59.260 --> 25:01.023
Yes, and if you were
her daughter,

25:01.060 --> 25:02.220
you could talk about that.

25:02.260 --> 25:04.967
So I just can't say
what I think?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.592
You can say what you think
here at home.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.234
But just not to other people.

25:08.270 --> 25:09.567
When you're 18.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.660
I know you think
I'm being unfair.

25:12.710 --> 25:15.599
But when you're older, and you
do something I disagree with,

25:15.640 --> 25:16.937
I won't tell it to other people.

25:16.980 --> 25:18.675
I will tell it to you first.

25:18.710 --> 25:20.143
Mom, it's politics.

25:20.180 --> 25:21.647
It's different.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.648
No, this is family;
it's not different.

25:23.690 --> 25:27.649
Then, so, if I disagree
with something Dad did,

25:27.690 --> 25:29.214
I should just tell him?

25:29.260 --> 25:31.080
What do you disagree with?

26:06.360 --> 26:07.896
It could be the other campaign.

26:07.930 --> 26:09.727
Is it?

26:12.100 --> 26:15.137
That is why
the 5-hydrowtryptamine gene

26:15.170 --> 26:17.035

Uh, thank you.

26:19.140 --> 26:23.236
Now, in your clinical trials,
what did you find unusual

26:23.280 --> 26:26.204
about this surplus
of tryptophan?

26:26.250 --> 26:30.619
Well, oddly, in some subjects,
it made them desire anal sex.

26:32.150 --> 26:33.959
Anal sex?

26:33.990 --> 26:35.059
Really?

26:35.090 --> 26:36.216
Was that surprising?

26:36.260 --> 26:37.215
LAWTON :
Yes.

26:37.260 --> 26:39.785
And also, in one subject,

26:39.830 --> 26:42.253
it caused an_ increased interest

26:47.800 --> 26:49.939
that Mrs. Fenton was
jealous of her husband

26:49.970 --> 26:51.801
because he was
haVIng an affair.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.979
We intend to show that Elvatyl

26:54.010 --> 26:56.934
in fact encouraged
sexual activity,

26:56.980 --> 26:58.800
which could lead
the jury to deduce

26:58.850 --> 27:01.341
that the Fentons' sexual
relationship was healthy...

27:01.380 --> 27:03.041
We'll stipulate
that Elvatyl causes

27:03.080 --> 27:03.978
increased libido,

Thank you, we'd like

sex in public places, like gas

You phone me

30:01.400 --> 30:02.321
Yes, Your Honor, that's true.

But, as you know,

30:03.330 --> 30:05.321
I myself was a late
addition to this case,

30:05.370 --> 30:07.122

Oh, come on.

I only talked to this therapist
last night, Your Honor.

30:13.540 --> 30:15.371
This isn't just
any therapist, Your Honor.

30:15.410 --> 30:17.901
This is the late Mrs. Fenton's
therapist,

30:17.950 --> 30:20.202
and, as such, any conversations
they had are subject

30:20.250 --> 30:22.047
to patient/therapist
confidentiality.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.149
But Mrs. Fenton is dead.

30:23.180 --> 30:24.386
That doesn't matter.

30:24.420 --> 30:26.308
The right remains intact
after death.

30:26.350 --> 30:27.954
In Illinois, yes,
but not in Wisconsin.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.087
Dr. Booth moved his practice to

30:31.130 --> 30:34.099
Wisconsin in 2009; he continued
to counsel Mrs. Fenton

30:34.130 --> 30:35.358
both telephonically
and in person.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.924
This is outrageous.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.292
You can't decide things
differently based on geography.

30:39.330 --> 30:43.061
Uh, actually, you can,

30:43.100 --> 30:45.159
The therapist's notes

30:45.210 --> 30:47.508
any post-2009 sessions

30:47.540 --> 30:49.428
Anything before
that is disallowed.

CANNING: _
So you were seeing
Mrs. Fenton a week before

30:54.250 --> 30:57.117
she shot herself

30:57.150 --> 30:58.913
Yes, I'm very
sorry to say.

30:58.950 --> 31:01.453
She was a very lovely woman.

31:01.490 --> 31:02.980
I'm so very sorry, Caitlin.

31:03.020 --> 31:05.124
And what did
she discuss with you

31:05.160 --> 31:07.424
at that time, Dr. Booth?

31:07.460 --> 31:10.497
Well, uh, many, many
things, of course.

31:10.530 --> 31:12.566
But, uh, she was
very jealous

31:12.600 --> 31:15.967
in the last month of
her too short life.

31:16.000 --> 31:16.989
Jealous?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.099
Of her husband?

31:19.140 --> 31:20.937
BOOTH:
Yes.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.107
She thought he was
sleeping with somebody.

31:23.140 --> 31:27.201
Did she say who she suspected
him of sleeping with?

31:27.250 --> 31:31.482
She thought he was
sleeping with her daughter.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.121
That'd be the plaintiff,

31:39.160 --> 31:41.321
Caitlin Fenton?

31:41.360 --> 31:42.452
BOOTH:
Yes.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.365
But of course,
this was just her suspicion.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.426
That doesn't mean there was
actually any reason to suspect.

31:47.470 --> 31:48.664
CANNING:
Of course.

31:48.700 --> 31:52.033
But did she give a reason
for her suspicion?

31:52.070 --> 31:55.301
Well, again, I would very
much like to caution here:

31:55.340 --> 31:56.500
this is merely
what she said.

31:56.540 --> 32:00.249
But she found
underwear

32:00.280 --> 32:03.078
among her
husband's effects.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.348
And did she say
who the underwear belonged to?

32:04.390 --> 32:06.415
Yes.

32:06.450 --> 32:08.008
Her daughter.

32:13.730 --> 32:16.619
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

32:16.660 --> 32:17.627
ALICIA:
So it's true,

32:17.660 --> 32:19.059
what the therapist said?

32:19.100 --> 32:20.124
No.

32:20.170 --> 32:21.239
I mean,

32:21.270 --> 32:24.535
my stepdad was...

32:24.570 --> 32:26.231
I am so sorry.

32:26.270 --> 32:28.306
(sniffles)

32:28.340 --> 32:31.400
He came into my room
and he took my underwear.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.405
Once.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.542
It wasn't a big deal,

32:33.580 --> 32:34.979
but I told him to stop.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.442
He said he would.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.608
He pleaded with me
not to tell my mom.

32:39.650 --> 32:41.709
I am so sorry.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.422
So there were
no sexual relations?

32:44.460 --> 32:45.722
No.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.387
My mom came in,

32:47.430 --> 32:49.455
and she accused me
of tempting him.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.627
This is after she started
taking the pills.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.661
And that's why I was moving out.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.459
I didn't want to be
the test case.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.330
I really didn't
want to be.
Don't worry,

33:00.370 --> 33:02.429
we'll make this work.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.671
(elevator bell dings)

33:20.760 --> 33:24.594
What are you doing now?

33:24.630 --> 33:28.031
Anything you want,
Mr. Gardner.

33:28.070 --> 33:30.265
I need something on
a Dr. Randall Booth,

33:30.300 --> 33:33.428
a therapist in Wisconsin.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.472
Anything specific?

33:35.510 --> 33:37.398
Everything specific.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.579
We need to kneecap him.

33:39.610 --> 33:41.544
Whatever you can find.

33:41.580 --> 33:45.448
Whatever we can
use in court.

33:45.490 --> 33:48.414
Okay, I'm on it.

33:50.590 --> 33:53.559
Kalinda has been snooping around
about me.

33:53.590 --> 33:54.796
Don't worry about it.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.590
If you say so.

34:02.700 --> 34:06.158
("Yankee Doodle" playing)

34:06.210 --> 34:08.531
MAN (singing):

34:10.340 --> 34:11.841
You know,
it is pretty catchy.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.677
* Wendy cares
for all the poor... *

34:15.520 --> 34:17.476
So no one is taking
credit for this video yet,

34:17.520 --> 34:19.249
but how are you dealing
with all of it?

34:19.290 --> 34:21.508
Well, it's difficult,

34:21.560 --> 34:24.552
but I think
that's just modern politics.

34:24.590 --> 34:27.582
INTERVIEWER:
Is there perhaps, though,
a good point to be made here?

34:27.630 --> 34:28.722
I mean, you have shot up
in the polls.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.523
And you've done it as this
friend of the downtrodden.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.563
And yet, here we see you
getting cosmetic surgery.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.397
Were you concerned
about your looks?

34:35.440 --> 34:36.395
No.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.465
About a year ago,

34:38.510 --> 34:40.728
I was diagnosed
with stage-2 breast cancer.

34:40.770 --> 34:43.500
Not even my best friends
knew about it.

34:43.540 --> 34:47.704
And, um, I had to undergo
a double mastectomy.

34:47.750 --> 34:50.275
I'm well now.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.379
I know there was
the option to live

34:52.420 --> 34:55.719
without_ reconstruction...
Anybody linking to the Wendy
cartoon, stop now!

34:55.760 --> 34:57.512
Stop!

34:57.560 --> 34:59.687
I'm sorry for taking
so long to respond
Stop.

34:59.730 --> 35:04.360
to these allegations, but it
really is a personal matter.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.664
And I just wish we would return

35:06.700 --> 35:08.861
to the issues.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.660
(footsteps)

35:12.710 --> 35:14.632
So what have you got?

35:14.680 --> 35:16.136
Uh-uh-uh.

35:16.180 --> 35:19.547
Oh, Kalinda,
there you are.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.639
You're working late.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.647
Yeah, just trying to get
a drug dealer off the streets.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.284
Someone I'm sure
Lockhart/Gardner

35:24.320 --> 35:26.185
will be representing tomorrow.

35:26.220 --> 35:28.609
Yep. I can feel the moral
gravity pulling me in.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.220
So, you called?

35:31.260 --> 35:33.649
Blake Calamar.

35:33.690 --> 35:35.191
Yeah?

35:35.230 --> 35:37.494
It's an interesting read.

35:37.530 --> 35:39.521
Do you want to share?

35:39.570 --> 35:43.666
In Baltimore _
he was working two jobs,

35:43.700 --> 35:45.361
but I guess
you'd identify there.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.207
The only problem
was his second job--

35:47.240 --> 35:49.538
it was protecting MS-13.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.208
Yep.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.548
When he wasn't protecting
Bond & Associate interests,

35:54.580 --> 35:56.719
he was out protecting
Baltimore's biggest meth gang.

35:58.420 --> 36:01.184
How do you know that?

36:01.220 --> 36:03.757
He was arrested, never charged.

36:03.790 --> 36:05.781
Bond got him off.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.393
Oh, no.

36:10.430 --> 36:11.897
That's official_
state's attorney busmess.

36:11.930 --> 36:17.436
Got a lovely little viper nest
going on over there.

36:21.010 --> 36:23.308
Hey...

36:23.340 --> 36:25.479
If I were you, I'd be careful.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.668
Thanks.

36:36.390 --> 36:38.483
All I can say is my involvement
with this Wendy cartoon

36:38.530 --> 36:39.929
has become a distraction
from the real issues

36:39.960 --> 36:41.655
in this campaign.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.656
A toast to a
fallen comrade.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.759
...Childs had nothing to do...
It could have been us.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.633
He had no knowledge
of my involvement.

36:48.670 --> 36:50.638
Not a bad day's work, huh?

36:52.040 --> 36:53.507
Come on, Eli.

36:53.540 --> 36:54.837
It's just you and me here.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.370
You pointed the
press toward him.

36:56.410 --> 36:58.378
I was asked a simple question
by a reporter

36:58.410 --> 37:02.710
and I chose to answer it
honestly.

37:02.750 --> 37:05.719
STURGES:
And so I apologize
to Wendy Scott-Carr

37:05.750 --> 37:07.718
and to Glenn Childs.

37:07.750 --> 37:10.913
Effective today, I tender my
resignation from his campaign.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.689
Thank you.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.698
MAN:
This announcement from
Patrick Sturges is the latest...

37:18.830 --> 37:20.661
Hey, Dad.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.404
Dad?

37:37.320 --> 37:40.619
ALICIA:
And you were a patient
of Dr. Randall Booth's

37:40.650 --> 37:42.584
before_he moved
to Wisconsm?
Yes.

37:42.620 --> 37:43.951
Your Honor,
we must object again.

37:43.990 --> 37:47.448
And we must ove_rrule
again, Mr. Canning.

37:47.490 --> 37:49.924
ALICIA:
Now, do you know

37:49.960 --> 37:53.418
the reason why Dr. Booth
moved to Wisconsin?

37:53.470 --> 37:54.789
The reason?

37:58.770 --> 38:00.306
You?

38:00.340 --> 38:01.876
Can you explain?

38:01.910 --> 38:05.698
Well, Dr. Booth, he...

38:05.750 --> 38:08.674
I was his patient
and he slept with me.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.684
I threatened to
bring charges

38:13.720 --> 38:16.416
so he...
well, he decided to move.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.849
Who found her?

38:18.890 --> 38:20.858
The witness her?
Yeah.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.027
Blake did.

38:22.060 --> 38:23.698
ALICIA:
And do you have an opinion

38:23.730 --> 38:25.766
about Dr. Booth's veracity?

38:25.800 --> 38:27.859
Objection, Your Honor.
Sustained.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.891
Nothing further, Your Honor.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.738
CANNING:
Your Honor, it would
be our preference

38:33.770 --> 38:38.036
to recall Dr. Randall Booth
to the stand,

38:38.080 --> 38:40.605
however it's come
to our attention

38:40.650 --> 38:41.844
that he's been hospitalized

38:41.880 --> 38:44.075
after a burglary attempt
at his office.

38:44.120 --> 38:49.717
We ask for a continuance
until we can recall this
essential Witness.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.025
JUDGE PARKS:
Denied. Is there
anything else, Mr. Canning?

38:53.060 --> 38:55.722
CANNING:
We ask for
a five minute recess

38:55.760 --> 39:00.595
so we_can discuss a settlement
With plaintiff's counsel.

39:00.630 --> 39:01.961
JUDGE PARKS:
Granted.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.661
We're in recess

39:03.700 --> 39:06.100
until 4:10 pm.
(bangs gavel)

39:06.140 --> 39:08.802
So he said, "What do we need
to end this right now?"

39:08.840 --> 39:09.704
I love it when they say "we."

39:09.740 --> 39:12.379
This is during the
five minute recess?

39:12.410 --> 39:13.809
Yeah, the clock was ticking.

39:13.850 --> 39:14.976
So I said
very simply,

39:15.020 --> 39:17.716
as though it were the most
natural thing in the world,

39:17.750 --> 39:20.639
"You want to settle the whole
class action? $40 million."

39:20.690 --> 39:22.817
I thought he was going
to come back at ten.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.078
He comes in at 30.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.825
Little did he know
we'd take 20.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.691
So we settle at 35!

39:28.730 --> 39:30.493
$35 million.

39:30.530 --> 39:32.669
Of which we get
to keep $7 million.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.736
We buy another floor
of offices.

39:34.770 --> 39:37.989
Two floors, with a gym.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.032
Why do I seem
happier than you?

39:41.070 --> 39:42.401
Because you won.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.372
The firm is solvent.

39:43.410 --> 39:46.538
You make it sound so
end-of—the-year boring.

39:46.580 --> 39:48.047
This is big.
It is.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.513
So smile.

39:49.550 --> 39:50.972
No, Kalinda,

39:51.020 --> 39:52.578
a genuine smile.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.988
Look, there's Blake.

39:58.890 --> 40:00.482
Oh, I get it.

40:00.530 --> 40:02.896
It's because he found
the Witness and you didn't.

40:02.930 --> 40:04.898
Yeah, that's it.

40:04.930 --> 40:06.818
Mm-hmm.

40:06.870 --> 40:08.531
Hey, look, Blake's got a date.

40:08.570 --> 40:11.038
I've got to see
What kind of woman dates Blake.

40:11.070 --> 40:12.901
Come on.

40:12.940 --> 40:14.066
Hi, Blake.

40:14.110 --> 40:15.737
Hey.

40:15.780 --> 40:17.771
Hey.
Hi.

40:17.810 --> 40:20.142
Oh, that's right,

40:20.180 --> 40:21.613
I think you two
know each other.

40:21.650 --> 40:23.868
Oh, no, I don't think
we do. I'm Alicia.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.047
No, he means me. Hi, Donna.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.888
Kalinda. I was just heading home
from work when Blake dropped by

40:28.920 --> 40:30.854
and asked if I wanted to come.

40:30.890 --> 40:32.027
So you work

40:32.060 --> 40:34.927
With Kalinda?
I do. And how do you two
know each other?

40:34.960 --> 40:36.848
Um, from
the state attorney's office.

40:36.900 --> 40:37.889
You're pretty.

40:37.930 --> 40:39.898
Thank you.

40:39.930 --> 40:41.761
If I wore
heels like that,

40:41.800 --> 40:43.028
I would tip over.

40:43.070 --> 40:45.766
Donna, could we have
a moment please?

40:45.810 --> 40:46.902
Your jacket-- I like it.

40:46.940 --> 40:48.202
Thank-thank you.

40:48.240 --> 40:51.801
A moment?
Sure. Let's have a moment.

40:54.580 --> 40:55.945
Hey, good job today.

40:55.980 --> 40:57.743
Yeah, I was pretty bitchin'.

40:57.780 --> 40:59.213
(both laughing)

40:59.250 --> 41:01.753
She's so not your type.

41:01.790 --> 41:04.156
Donna, you're so off base.

41:04.190 --> 41:05.680
Really? How far off base am I?

41:05.730 --> 41:07.652
What's going on?

41:07.690 --> 41:09.191
Are you trying
to get back at me?

41:09.230 --> 41:10.993
DONNA:
Oh, you mean Blake.

41:11.030 --> 41:12.998
That's right, you did say
something about a Blake.

41:13.030 --> 41:14.566
I didn't even
make the connection.

41:14.600 --> 41:15.999
Look, I'm taking you home.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.837
No, you're not.

41:17.870 --> 41:19.508
You're not connected
to me anymore,

41:19.540 --> 41:20.905
and I'm not connected to you.

41:22.580 --> 41:24.070
Thanks.

41:34.050 --> 41:35.881
Mr. Canning.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.717
Mrs. Florrick.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.057
Are you looking for Diane?

41:39.090 --> 41:41.888
I am. We have a few
details to work out.

41:41.930 --> 41:44.728
You fought well, sir.

41:44.770 --> 41:47.898
Yes, yes, I did.

41:47.930 --> 41:50.194
Better luck next time.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.060
(chuckles)

41:52.110 --> 41:53.907
(both chuckling)

41:53.940 --> 41:55.601
Why are we laughing?

41:55.640 --> 41:57.176
Well, because we're funny.

41:57.210 --> 41:59.144
Oh.

41:59.180 --> 42:02.047
Mrs. Florrick, you think you
were my equal in that courtroom,

42:02.080 --> 42:03.274
but you were new math,

42:03.320 --> 42:06.141
I was, uh, advanced
trigonometry.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.648
Well, too bad trigonometry lost.

42:09.690 --> 42:11.829
I didn't lose.

42:11.860 --> 42:13.953
Lockhart/Gardner
stumbled their way

42:13.990 --> 42:17.050
into a $90 million
class action.

42:17.100 --> 42:19.819
MRG Pharmaceuticals asked
me to lower you down

42:19.870 --> 42:21.599
to $50 million.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.938
I landed you at 35.

42:23.970 --> 42:27.667
I'm going home With
a bonus of $1.3 million
and stock options.

42:27.710 --> 42:29.177
That's not losing.

42:29.210 --> 42:31.872
But, hey, it's been fun,

42:31.910 --> 42:33.878
and maybe I'll see you
again sometime.

42:33.910 --> 42:35.878
We can mix it up in court.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.569
Have a nice party.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.920
