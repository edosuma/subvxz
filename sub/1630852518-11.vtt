WEBVTT

00:27.152 --> 00:28.570
Genius-idea time!

00:28.653 --> 00:31.406
You guys do a giant
pink cupcake experiment,

00:31.489 --> 00:33.700
then I… test it.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.035
Go away, Johnny.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.578
We're reading!

00:36.661 --> 00:39.956
Oh, please don't tell me
another Wizard Lad book came out.

00:40.040 --> 00:44.127
No, but they just released
the first chapter of<i> Wizard Lad Six,</i>

00:44.210 --> 00:47.172
<i>The Dragon Sword of Fire,</i> online.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.508
And the chapter ends the night before
Dumbledumb's school for Wizards'

00:50.592 --> 00:52.510
famous Dumble-Dance!

00:52.594 --> 00:54.804
And Wizard Lad
was just about to ask Fiore,

00:54.888 --> 00:57.515
the Wizard Girl of Fire,
to go with him!

00:57.599 --> 00:59.309
You are not my dog.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.062
And we are dying to know
if she says yes,

01:02.145 --> 01:05.440
but the rest of the book
is not coming out till next month!

01:05.523 --> 01:07.901
Aw… Not really.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.569
But now that you're done
with Wizard Lad,

01:09.652 --> 01:12.072
you can focus on my giant
pink cupcake experiment

01:12.155 --> 01:13.907
that also… flies.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.576
Close.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.411
Oh, look at that!

01:18.495 --> 01:21.331
A Johnny "Do any experiment you want"
coupon that I gave you

01:21.414 --> 01:23.666
'cause I said I would do
any experiment you want.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.212
We've downloaded
the new Wizard Lad chapter

01:27.295 --> 01:30.089
into the VR spheres
with an AI simulation

01:30.173 --> 01:34.469
based on past Wizard Lad
and Fiore character choices.

01:34.552 --> 01:38.056
So just go to Wizard Land,
ask Fiore to the Dumble-Dance,

01:38.139 --> 01:40.058
then come back and tell us
what happens next!

01:40.141 --> 01:42.769
You want me to go back
into a book where I almost died

01:42.852 --> 01:45.313
and ask a girl on a date?

01:45.396 --> 01:48.024
Fiore is the coolest, Johnny!
You're gonna love her!

01:48.107 --> 01:50.401
-No, wait. I don't like icky gooey…

01:51.694 --> 01:52.862
-…lovey stuff.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.031
Too late. And check it!

01:55.115 --> 01:57.742
I'm Fofo the Dragon again.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.788
Let's just find fire-girl, ask her
to the dance, mini vomit, and leave.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.916
Stop. Fiore's not going to say yes
with that attitude.

02:04.999 --> 02:07.502
You need a cool entrance to woo her.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.420
Yeah, Johnny don't woo.

02:09.504 --> 02:13.383
But remember, you're not Johnny here,
you're Wizard Lad.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.676
Oh, right.

02:16.886 --> 02:19.806
-Whoo-hoo!
-Wizard Lad! Yay!

02:22.559 --> 02:25.979
A cool and tasty entrance. Nice.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.398
Look, there's Fiore.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.441
But she's not impressed…

02:31.442 --> 02:33.153
Well, I am. Mm…

02:33.236 --> 02:35.196
'Cause it's so good.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.617
Wizard Lad, what are you doing
flying around on a giant cupcake?

02:39.701 --> 02:43.246
I have to ask… Fiore
to the Dumble-Dance.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.707
Fiore? To the Dumble-Dance?

02:45.790 --> 02:47.417
Why would you want to do that?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.795
Uh, well, she's cool,
she has fire powers,

02:50.879 --> 02:52.672
and her eyes are like…

02:52.755 --> 02:56.509
Well, I've seen her talking many times
to the evil Moldywart…

03:00.346 --> 03:03.683
Wizard Lad! Look! Still no wart!

03:05.226 --> 03:06.561
…who you made not evil,

03:06.644 --> 03:08.938
but I don't see
what's so great about her!

03:09.022 --> 03:13.610
Wizard Lad, did I overhear
that you wanted to ask me something?

03:13.693 --> 03:14.611
Yeah.

03:14.694 --> 03:18.865
OK, so… Bleurgh! Will you go with me,

03:18.948 --> 03:22.285
Wizard Lad, not Johnny,
to the Dumble-Dance date-thing?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.913
I… will.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.040
Great! Later, everybody.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.877
If you prove you're a brave
and worthy companion

03:30.960 --> 03:34.422
by getting me
the Dragon Sword of Fire!

03:37.091 --> 03:38.885
OK, didn't like the sound of that,

03:38.968 --> 03:40.887
and what's the Dragon Sword of Fire?

03:42.597 --> 03:46.434
It's the most powerful
and magical sword in existence,

03:46.517 --> 03:49.520
and legend says it's hidden
in the Never-Go-Into Forest.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.898
Yeah, I'm gonna need a minute.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.193
-What's he doing?

03:57.070 --> 04:01.532
Hey! You didn't say anything about
me getting a Dragon Sword of Fire.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.787
So that's who wants the sword.

04:05.870 --> 04:09.207
And she won't go to the dance
with Wizard Lad without it.

04:09.290 --> 04:13.211
She must need it to stop a great evil
that threatens the dance.

04:13.294 --> 04:16.381
Johnny, you have to go back
and get her that sword,

04:16.464 --> 04:18.758
or the whole wizard world
could be destroyed!

04:18.841 --> 04:21.928
No. The deal was I ask her to a dance,

04:22.011 --> 04:23.680
not risk my life for a sword, and--

04:23.763 --> 04:25.473
Is that another coupon?

04:25.556 --> 04:29.519
"Good for any experiment,
including risking my life."

04:29.602 --> 04:31.938
-OK, fine! Send me back in.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.566
I'll get the Dragon Sword of Fire.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.779
Splendid! I'll get ready for the dance…

04:41.114 --> 04:44.117
and wait for you outside the forest.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.745
Cool! I mean, hot?

04:47.829 --> 04:51.165
I mean, does anyone else know
how to get to this forest?

04:51.249 --> 04:54.252
I do, since I'm the founding
and only member

04:54.335 --> 04:55.753
of the Magic Map Club.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.006
Thanks, Sally.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.341
I hope you find
the Dragon Sword, Wizard Lad,

05:00.425 --> 05:02.927
and I hope you have a great time
at the Dumble-Dance!

05:04.804 --> 05:07.473
What's with her? I said thanks.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.602
Johnny, I think Sally
wants to go to the Dumble-Dance

05:11.686 --> 05:13.062
with Wizard Lad.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.065
OMG. You're right, Fofo,
and you know what else?

05:16.149 --> 05:18.568
I don't care!

05:20.903 --> 05:21.904
But look!

05:23.323 --> 05:25.116
The Dragon Sword.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.993
Wow, that was easy.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.623
Not easy!

05:32.707 --> 05:36.669
Who dares take the sword

05:36.753 --> 05:42.258
I have protected for 2,000 years?

05:42.341 --> 05:43.760
Johnny Test!

05:43.843 --> 05:47.263
I mean, Wizard Lad,
and I need it for a date.

05:49.432 --> 05:54.520
I have stopped countless wizards
far bigger than you

05:54.604 --> 05:57.190
who tried to take it from me, and…

05:57.273 --> 05:59.233
What's that smell?

05:59.317 --> 06:02.111
It smells sweet.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.280
Oh, that's my pink flying cupcake.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.240
Is it any good?

06:06.324 --> 06:09.577
'Cause I am so sick
of eating wizards.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.662
It's so good!

06:15.833 --> 06:18.086
I usually don't like
wizard-eating serpents,

06:18.169 --> 06:19.754
but she was really nice.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.589
Whoo-hoo!

06:22.423 --> 06:24.759
Wizard Lad, you got it!

06:24.842 --> 06:26.427
Eh, it was a piece of cake.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.221
Actually, it was an entire cupcake.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.683
Now, will you go to the Dumble-Dance
with "Wizard Lad"

06:32.767 --> 06:35.937
so I can tell my sisters
they fell in love?

06:36.020 --> 06:39.732
Oh, Wizard Lad, my answer is…

06:39.816 --> 06:41.067
this!

06:41.984 --> 06:44.654
I'm sorry, dragon confused here.

06:44.737 --> 06:48.074
I am the secret daughter of Moldywart,

06:48.157 --> 06:50.326
and since you made him nice,

06:50.409 --> 06:54.872
it's now my duty to carry on
the evil family tradition.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.125
And with the Dragon Sword of Fire,

06:57.208 --> 07:01.003
I'm going to destroy
the famous Wizard Lad.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.382
So that's a "no" on the dance?

07:07.510 --> 07:09.637
Wait. Where'd he go?

07:09.720 --> 07:14.851
-I can't believe Fiore is evil.
-Killer plot twist.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.855
Yeah, well, that was a big "no"
on the dance, so let me down.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.606
Johnny, you have to stop her.

07:20.690 --> 07:24.068
With that sword, she could destroy
all of Dumbledumb and Wizard Land.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.487
There is no way
I'm going back there, and--

07:27.738 --> 07:30.658
Darn it! How many coupons
did I give you?

07:34.871 --> 07:37.748
Oh, good. You're back!

07:44.005 --> 07:47.467
The Dragon Sword
is more powerful than my wand!

07:47.550 --> 07:49.010
Well, duh!

07:50.011 --> 07:51.971
But what about two wands?

07:56.809 --> 07:59.812
Sally, your wand. It's destroyed!

08:00.730 --> 08:01.772
Don't you know by now

08:01.856 --> 08:05.026
there isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you, Wizard Lad?

08:06.235 --> 08:07.195
Cool?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.655
Don't you mean… hot?!

08:10.323 --> 08:13.075
No, I mean Fofo!

08:17.038 --> 08:20.124
-We have to get back to the school.
-Why?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.376
'Cause no matter
how powerful any kid gets,

08:22.460 --> 08:24.962
there's still one force even stronger.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.131
-What's that?
-Their parents.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.760
-Welcome to the Dumble-Dance,

08:30.843 --> 08:34.514
where the only magic is the slow dance.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.267
Wizard Lad! Where's Fiore?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.769
I thought she was going with you.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.647
Yeah, slight change of plans.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.567
Because Wizard Lad
and the Dumble-Dance

08:46.651 --> 08:48.528
are about to be canceled.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.989
Now shout, or use your dad powers
to take away her phone,

08:52.073 --> 08:53.616
or that sword!

08:53.699 --> 08:57.119
Uh-uh-uh. I don't advise that, Father.

08:57.203 --> 09:01.707
Don't get short with me, young lady,
or I'll get short with you!

09:02.333 --> 09:04.335
Hmm, as you wish.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.340
Well, I did raise her to be evil,

09:09.423 --> 09:11.259
but if I could just lift…

09:14.303 --> 09:18.266
Your magic is no match
for my new fire powers.

09:18.349 --> 09:22.395
Oh, yeah? Well, you're not the only one
who can play with… fire!

09:23.938 --> 09:27.608
Anything you can do, I can do hotter!

09:27.692 --> 09:31.070
But you're no match
for mega-fiery Wizard Lad!

09:32.655 --> 09:34.490
Once I destroy you,

09:34.574 --> 09:38.869
I will become the strongest wizard
in the land!

09:38.953 --> 09:42.415
But you can't destroy me
if you can't find me!

09:44.875 --> 09:48.045
Found you, and now I will…

09:50.464 --> 09:52.675
Once I pick up this sword, and…

09:54.010 --> 09:57.138
I'll take that, and do this…

09:58.681 --> 10:01.475
I'll get you for this, Wizard Lad!

10:01.559 --> 10:03.019
My reign will…

10:03.102 --> 10:04.979
Quiet down, young lady,

10:05.062 --> 10:07.315
or I'll send you back
to magic reform school.

10:07.398 --> 10:10.109
No… No-o-o-o!

10:10.192 --> 10:12.445
Wizard Lad, I knew you would win.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.030
Not without your help.

10:14.113 --> 10:18.451
Well, you know we've always
made a great team, Wizard Lad.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.373
-Hey, Sally?
-Yes, Wizard Lad?

10:24.457 --> 10:29.962
Um, do you want to go
to the Dumble-Dance with, uh… me?

10:30.046 --> 10:33.716
Oh, Wizard Lad,
I thought you'd never ask!

10:36.469 --> 10:38.346
Oh, that was so close!

10:38.429 --> 10:39.805
What was so close?

10:39.889 --> 10:43.017
Johnny asked Sally to the Dumble-Dance,
and she said yes.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.810
Wizard Lad asked her.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.813
How did we not see that?

10:47.897 --> 10:51.609
Wizard Lad and Sally end up together!

10:51.692 --> 10:53.027
It's perfect!

10:53.110 --> 10:54.320
And it was all for nothing.

10:54.403 --> 10:57.406
I almost got destroyed by a fire girl
so you could find out

10:57.490 --> 11:00.117
who a character in a book
goes to a dance with.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.829
It's not for nothing, because…

11:03.913 --> 11:07.583
Here's all the "Johnny does any
experiment we want" coupons back.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.712
Uh, you don't have a dragon sword
I could borrow, do ya?

11:11.796 --> 11:14.757
No, but…

11:19.553 --> 11:20.805
Cool.
