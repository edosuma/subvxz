08:01.130 --> 08:03.473
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

08:03.580 --> 08:05.753
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

08:05.860 --> 08:08.476
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

08:08.590 --> 08:10.444
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

08:10.550 --> 08:12.939
AND MAY YOU STAY

08:13.040 --> 08:15.349
FOREVER YOUNG

08:15.460 --> 08:18.213
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

08:18.320 --> 08:20.424
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

08:20.530 --> 08:22.805
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

08:22.910 --> 08:24.969
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

08:25.090 --> 08:27.809
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

08:27.920 --> 08:30.059
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

08:30.160 --> 08:32.048
AND MAY YOU STAY

08:32.160 --> 08:34.572
FOREVER YOUNG

08:34.680 --> 08:37.023
MAY YOU STAY

08:37.130 --> 08:40.509
FOREVER YOUNG

08:43.760 --> 08:45.819
- MORNING, HONEY.
- HMM.

08:45.930 --> 08:47.033
HI.

08:47.140 --> 08:48.311
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:48.420 --> 08:50.832
- MMM.

08:50.940 --> 08:53.408
I JUST DON'T WANNA
GO INTO WORK TODAY

08:53.530 --> 08:55.521
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO ZOE.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.769
- HUH?
CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.395
- WELL, I HARDLY KNOW HER,
AND I ASKED HER FOR HER BABY.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.504
SO IT MIGHT BE PRETTY BAD.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.919
OH, I'M A CRAZY PERSON.

09:08.030 --> 09:10.089
- HMM.
- I MEAN, IT'S OFFICIAL.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.883
I'VE LOST MY MIND.

09:14.790 --> 09:16.587
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO SAY,
"NO, YOU HAVEN'T."

09:16.690 --> 09:20.137
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T.
SORRY, I WAS SUPPOSED TO--

09:20.240 --> 09:22.037
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT THOUGH?

09:30.630 --> 09:33.349
- SO, UM, THIS GIRL AMY,

09:33.460 --> 09:34.870
YOU KINDA LIKE HER?

09:37.300 --> 09:38.324
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

09:38.430 --> 09:39.636
- GONNA ASK HER OUT?

09:39.750 --> 09:41.365
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

09:41.470 --> 09:43.199
- WELL, I HAD AN IDEA.

09:43.300 --> 09:46.019
I BORROWED HER DAD'S
HEDGE CLIPPERS LAST SUMMER,

09:46.130 --> 09:47.882
AND ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS YOU TAKE THEM BACK

09:48.000 --> 09:51.754
AND WHILE YOU'RE THERE,
ASK HER OUT.

09:54.420 --> 09:55.375
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

09:55.490 --> 09:57.583
- YOU JUST FIND SOMETHING
THAT YOU BOTH HAVE IN COMMON.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.793
LIKE, YOU LIKE MUSIC,
DON'T YOU?

09:59.900 --> 10:02.209
YOU ASK HER ABOUT THE OLD
RECORDS THAT SHE TOOK.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.459
DID SHE LIKE THEM?
DID SHE PLAY ANY OF THEM?

10:04.560 --> 10:05.629
WHAT SONG DID SHE
LIKE THE BEST?

10:05.740 --> 10:07.071
OR, YOU KNOW,
THAT KIND OF THING.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.111
- I GUESS.

10:08.220 --> 10:09.460
- AND MAYBE SAY
SOMETHING NICE TO HER.

10:09.570 --> 10:10.730
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
COMPLIMENT HER

10:10.850 --> 10:12.636
ABOUT HER HAIR, CLOTHES,
ANYTHING.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.741
- SHE'S GONNA THINK
I'M A KISS-ASS.

10:14.850 --> 10:16.465
- NO, NOT IF
YOU DO IT RIGHT.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.502
NOT IF YOU DO IT
IN A CASUAL MANNER

10:18.610 --> 10:20.237
AND IF YOU MEAN IT.

10:20.340 --> 10:21.193
ALL RIGHT,
I GOT AN IDEA.

10:21.310 --> 10:24.404
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
"I WAS SURFING THE WEB, AMY,

10:24.520 --> 10:25.748
"AND GUESS WHAT.

10:25.860 --> 10:27.589
"SIMON AND GARFUNKEL
ARE COMING TO TOWN.

10:27.690 --> 10:29.100
I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE'D GET SOME TICKETS."

10:29.210 --> 10:30.654
- THEY'RE PRACTICALLY DEAD.
THEY'RE NOT ON TOUR.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.068
- SIMON AND GARFUNKEL
AREN'T DEAD.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.000
THEY'LL LIVE FOREVER.
IT'S NOT THE POINT.

10:34.110 --> 10:35.839
WHOEVER'S COMING TO TOWN.
- YEAH, I GET THE POINT BUT--

10:35.940 --> 10:39.387
- SO IT'S CONNECT,
COMPLIMENT,

10:39.500 --> 10:40.524
AND CLOSE.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.461
IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL DANCE.

10:43.570 --> 10:45.322
VERY COSMIC, SPIRITUAL.

10:45.430 --> 10:47.398
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.467
UH, MISS.

10:48.570 --> 10:50.083
EXCUSE ME.
- NO.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.713
- JUST COULD I HAVE
YOUR HELP HERE?

10:51.820 --> 10:53.299
- GRANDPA, PLEASE DON'T.
SHE'S GONNA THINK YOU'RE A PERV.

10:53.410 --> 10:54.809
- NO, SHE'S WON'T.
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

10:54.930 --> 10:56.431
- YEAH, HI.
HOW YOU DOING, SANDY?

10:56.550 --> 10:57.642
- YEAH.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.819
- THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS.

10:59.930 --> 11:01.784
- OH, THANK YOU.
YEAH, I MADE THESE.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.162
- OH, YOU DID?
- YEAH.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.269
- OH, WOW.

11:04.380 --> 11:06.689
WELL, ANYWAY, WE WERE HAVING
A SLIGHT DISAGREEMENT.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.791
HE SAYS THAT
THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE

11:08.900 --> 11:13.496
OCCURRED IN 1916,
AND I SAID 1906.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.761
- OH, IT WAS 1906.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.666
- 1906.
- [groans]

11:17.780 --> 11:19.566
WHOOPS.
- DON'T FEEL BAD.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.672
THERE'S THIS PICTURE OVER THERE
BY THE CASH REGISTER,

11:21.780 --> 11:23.395
AND I HAVE TO LOOK AT IT
EVERY SINGLE DAY, SO...

11:23.510 --> 11:25.228
- I SEE.
- REALLY? WHERE'S THAT?

11:25.330 --> 11:27.298
- IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE.
RIGHT WHEN YOU WALK IN.

11:27.410 --> 11:28.263
YEAH, CHECK IT OUT.

11:28.370 --> 11:29.712
YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY
A COOL PICTURE.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.026
- YEAH, I'LL HAVE
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

11:31.130 --> 11:32.267
- YEAH, MM-HMM.
- THANKS, SANDY.

11:32.380 --> 11:33.062
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.683
CAN I GET YOU
SOME MORE COFFEE?

11:34.790 --> 11:36.655
- YES, AS LONG
AS IT'S HAZELNUT.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.068
I'M REALLY ENJOYING IT.

11:38.180 --> 11:39.898
IT GOES GREAT
WITH EVERYTHING I'M HAVING.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.342
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
IT'S SO GOOD.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.621
- THANK YOU.

11:42.730 --> 11:45.483
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.249
- YOU DIDN'T ASK HER OUT.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.521
- DIDN'T HAVE TO.
IT'S IN THE BAG, MAN.

11:49.630 --> 11:50.562
THAT'S SOME
LOW-HANGING FRUIT, SON.

11:50.670 --> 11:53.218
THAT'S TOO EASY,
SO TO SPEAK.

11:53.330 --> 11:54.877
[chuckles]

11:56.160 --> 11:57.388
- PATRICK?

11:57.500 --> 11:58.501
I HAVE YOUR COFFEE.

11:58.610 --> 11:59.634
THAN KS, MAN.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.149
HEY.

12:01.270 --> 12:03.295
- HOW'S IT GOING?
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:03.410 --> 12:04.786
- I JUST CAME TO SEE YOU.
YOU LOOK SO CUTE.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.334
- OH, THANKS.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.374
- I LOVE THIS UNIFORM,
AND I CAME FOR SOME COFFEE.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.515
- COOL, OKAY.
- IT'S BUSY.

12:09.620 --> 12:10.928
- YEAH, REALLY BUSY.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.439
REALLY STRESSED OUT RIGHT NOW.
- WHAT SHOULD I GET?

12:12.550 --> 12:13.824
- UH, HOW 'BOUT
AN ICED COFFEE?

12:13.940 --> 12:15.931
- OKAY, ICED COFFEE.
- GREAT, THANK YOU.

12:16.040 --> 12:16.938
- THAT SOUNDS VERY REFRESHING.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.416
OH, I BROUGHT YOUR MAIL.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.930
IT'S EXCITING.
- OH, LANDS' END.

12:21.050 --> 12:22.494
THAT'S REALLY EXCITING.
THAN KS.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.498
- FOR YOUR HOME,
FOR YOUR NEW HOME.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.568
MOM WAS TRYING TO GET
EVERYBODY TOGETHER ON SUNDAY

12:25.670 --> 12:26.591
FOR, LIKE, A BIG DINNER.

12:26.710 --> 12:27.779
DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD DO THAT?

12:27.880 --> 12:29.222
- I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW.
- OKAY.

12:29.330 --> 12:30.467
- BUT I'LL THINK ABOUT IT,
OKAY?

12:30.570 --> 12:31.559
- YEAH.
- HERE YOU GO.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.908
- OKAY.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.261
- SO, OKAY,
THAT'S $2.50, PLEASE.

12:35.370 --> 12:36.462

12:36.580 --> 12:38.741

OH, BOY.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.259
- THERE YOU GO.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.608
- OH, WAIT,

12:41.720 --> 12:43.961
- BANANA'S ON ME,
HOW 'BOUT THAT?

12:44.070 --> 12:45.719
- SURE YOU DON'T WANT THIS?
- MOM, CAN YOU JUST

12:45.830 --> 12:47.445
BRING IT TOMORROW
WHEN YOU PROBABLY STOP BY?

12:47.550 --> 12:49.825
OR THE NEXT DAY
WHEN I'M SURE YOU'LL COME BY?

12:49.940 --> 12:51.248
OKAY, I'M SORRY, I JUST
CAN'T HANG OUT RIGHT NOW.

12:51.350 --> 12:53.454
I LOVE YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.869
HEY, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

13:03.020 --> 13:05.329
- HI.

13:08.850 --> 13:11.432
- HOW'S IT GOING?

13:11.540 --> 13:12.711
- IT'S GOING.

13:12.820 --> 13:15.197
COME IN.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.132
- I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU.

13:20.590 --> 13:22.137
- I KNOW.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.105
AND I'M SORRY,
I SHOULD'VE CALLED YOU BACK.

13:24.210 --> 13:26.314
IT'S MY BAD.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.342
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:31.050 --> 13:33.211
- THERE'S JUST A LOT
GOING ON WITH ME.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.947
I HAVE A LOT
ON MY PLATE RIGHT NOW.

13:35.050 --> 13:37.280
- I KNOW.
- THAT'S ALL.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.537
- OKAY.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.779
I KNOW ALL THAT
STUFF'S GOING ON.

13:40.880 --> 13:44.395
I'M HERE FOR YOU, OKAY?

13:48.480 --> 13:51.859
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.134
I WAS THINKING ALSO,

13:55.240 --> 13:56.992
YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK
TO THE LAWYER.

13:57.110 --> 13:59.510
I COULD GO WITH YOU.
IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.245
- NO, NO, YOU CAN'T.

14:01.350 --> 14:02.829
- I JUST FEEL LIKE
I WAS THERE.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.282
I CAN GIVE
AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT.

14:04.390 --> 14:05.834
- YOU WERE THERE,
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED.

14:05.940 --> 14:07.214
YOU'RE A WITNESS
IN THE CASE.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.389
YOU CAN'T MEET
WITH ME AND MY LAWYER, OKAY?

14:08.500 --> 14:09.808
IT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.116
- OKAY.
- IT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

14:11.220 --> 14:13.290
- YEAH, OKAY, I GET IT.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.799
- I KNOW YOU DIDN'T.
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED--

14:14.920 --> 14:16.842
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO,
ALL RIGHT?

14:16.950 --> 14:18.645
HADDIE, YOU LIVE IN
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD

14:18.750 --> 14:20.672
THAN I DO, ALL RIGHT?

14:20.790 --> 14:23.361
I HAVE REAL PROBLEMS.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.334
MY PROBLEMS.

14:25.450 --> 14:27.918
AND I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEM
ON MY OWN WITHOUT YOU.

14:28.030 --> 14:29.611
DO YOU GET THAT?

14:29.730 --> 14:31.174
- YEAH.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.349
- I'M SORRY THAT IT HAS
TO BE LIKE THAT,

14:32.450 --> 14:34.441
BUT THAT'S JUST THE WAY--
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.869
SO PLEASE, DON'T BRING
THAT UP AGAIN, ALL RIGHT?

14:36.970 --> 14:38.312
- OKAY.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.490
- THANK YOU.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.259
[door opens, closes]

14:52.370 --> 14:53.291
- HEY.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.368
- HEY.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.374
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:59.480 --> 15:02.586
- I JUST LEFT ALEX'S.

15:02.690 --> 15:05.272
- YEAH?
HOW'S HE DOIN'?

15:08.390 --> 15:09.550
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.309
- HEY.

15:11.420 --> 15:13.524
HEY, COME HERE.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.422
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.679
- MM-HMM.

15:34.930 --> 15:36.966
- WHAT'LL I SAY
WITHOUT YOU TO TALK TO

15:37.070 --> 15:38.890
NO ONE TO SERVE
OR VOLLEY THE BALL TO

15:39.000 --> 15:41.935
- HI.
YES, WELL, UM...

15:42.040 --> 15:45.077
YOU KNOW,
CONSENT IS A FACT ISSUE.

15:45.180 --> 15:48.479
SO YOU WILL NOT GET
SUMMARY JUDGMENT,

15:48.600 --> 15:51.319
BUT IF YOU--EXACT LY.

15:51.430 --> 15:53.352
IF YOU TALK TO YOUR CLIENT--

15:53.460 --> 15:56.088
YEAH, I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
ABOUT A COUNTERCLAIM.

15:56.190 --> 15:59.432
I LOOK FORWARD
TO TALKING TO YOU TOO.

15:59.540 --> 16:00.632
[sighs]

16:00.750 --> 16:03.059
- I'VE ALREADY MADE HIS LUNCHES
FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS,

16:03.160 --> 16:06.197
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

16:06.310 --> 16:09.438
AND THIS IS FOR THE MORNING

16:09.550 --> 16:11.165
IN CASE HE WANTS CEREAL.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.304
IT'S GOT RICE FLOUR IN IT.

16:12.410 --> 16:14.230
- RICE FLOUR?
- MM-HMM.

16:14.350 --> 16:16.170
- THERE'S SUCH A THING?
- YES, THERE IS.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.271
OH, DON'T FORGET
HIS FOOD JOURNAL.

16:18.390 --> 16:20.244
YOU HAVE TO WRITE EVERYTHING
DOWN IN IT EVEN IF IT'S A SNACK.

16:20.350 --> 16:22.864
- WE ARE NOT SERIOUSLY
GONNA WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN

16:22.980 --> 16:23.969
IN A FOOD JOURNAL.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.069
- YEAH, WE ARE.
WHY WOULDN'T WE?

16:25.190 --> 16:26.452
- WILL YOU PUT YOUR SHOES ON,
BUDDY?

16:26.570 --> 16:29.391
LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.560
- UM, I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE
DR. JOE MIGHT BE A QUACK.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.398
I MEAN, YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE EVERYTHING HE SAID

16:34.510 --> 16:36.228
CAME STRAIGHT OUT
OF GOD'S MOUTH.

16:36.340 --> 16:38.262
- HE'S A DOCTOR,
AND HE'S WRITTEN THREE BOOKS.

16:38.370 --> 16:40.099
SO I THINK HE MIGHT KNOW
A THING OR TWO ABOUT--

16:40.200 --> 16:42.191
- DR. JOE'S
WRITTEN THREE BOOKS.

16:42.310 --> 16:44.824
AND HE'S IN A CLUB WITH ALL
THE OTHER FIRST NAME DOCTORS.

16:44.930 --> 16:46.477
DR. PHIL AND DR. JAY.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.478
- DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS
TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM?

16:48.590 --> 16:50.103
- HOW HARD?
- LIKE, REALLY HARD.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.962
HE'S GOT 200 PEOPLE
ON HIS WAITING LIST.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.342
- SO IF HE'S
SUCH A HOT SHOT

16:53.460 --> 16:54.688
AND THERE'S SUCH
A WAITING LIST,

16:54.800 --> 16:57.109
THEN HOW DID WE
EVEN GET IN?

16:57.220 --> 16:59.142
- MY MOM.
SHE MADE THE REFERRAL.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.945
- SHE SENT A PICTURE OF YOU
OVER THERE?

17:01.050 --> 17:02.017
- DIDN'T HAVE TO.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.667
- ALL RIGHT, HEY,
YOU CAN'T BRING THAT.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.941
PUT THAT ON HERE.

17:06.050 --> 17:08.018
PUT YOUR BACKPACK ON.

17:08.130 --> 17:09.256
BOOM.

17:09.370 --> 17:11.952
YOU KNOW THERE'S
WHEAT IN BEER.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.334
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.475
- SO?

17:14.580 --> 17:16.024
- SO WHEN HE'S AT
HIS FIRST KEG PARTY,

17:16.130 --> 17:18.018
HE'S GONNA BE THE WEIRDO
IN THE SWEATER VEST

17:18.140 --> 17:19.858
SIPPING ON CHARDONNAY
IN THE CORNER.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.929
THAT'S ON YOU,
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.271
- BYE.

17:26.390 --> 17:27.277
- HEY.

17:27.390 --> 17:28.698
- HI.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.108
- HI, SWEETIE.

17:30.220 --> 17:32.176
- MMM, WHAT'S THIS?

17:32.290 --> 17:33.803
- SUGAR COOKIES
FOR THE BABY SHOWER.

17:33.910 --> 17:35.002
AND THEY GET PINK ICING.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.257
- MMM.
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.112
SO GOOD.
DELISH.

17:38.220 --> 17:39.733
I'M GONNA GO DO SOME LAUNDRY.
IS THAT OKAY?

17:39.850 --> 17:40.771
- YEAH.
- HELP YOURSELF.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.223
- HEY, UH,
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

17:43.330 --> 17:44.433
THERE'S ANOTHER LOAD
OF YOUR STUFF.

17:44.540 --> 17:45.575
IT'S ALL FOLDED
AND EVERYTHING.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.772
- GREAT. THAN KS.

17:46.890 --> 17:47.788
- AND I WAS GONNA
BRING IT OVER,

17:47.890 --> 17:49.676
BUT THEN I DIDN'T.

17:49.790 --> 17:50.927
- OKAY, LET'S LET IT GO.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.679
SEE YOU SOON.
- OH, AND SORRY.

17:52.790 --> 17:54.473
JUST ONE MORE THING.

17:54.590 --> 17:56.512
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T GET
ANYTHING FOR THE BABY SHOWER,

17:56.620 --> 17:59.509
THERE'S
A DINOSAUR-SHAPED RATTLE,

17:59.630 --> 18:00.483
AND THERE'S
ONE OF THOSE TOWELS

18:00.590 --> 18:01.898
THAT MAKES THE BABY
LOOK LIKE A PANDA.

18:02.010 --> 18:03.557
- I HATE THOSE.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.389
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
BECAUSE I CAN'T COME.

18:05.490 --> 18:07.071
SO YOU COULD JUST PUT
MY NAME ON WHATEVER.

18:07.180 --> 18:08.761
- SO, WAIT,
YOU CAN'T COME?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.529
- NO, I HAVE A SHIFT.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.800
SO I ALREADY TALKED
TO AUNT KRISTINA.

18:11.910 --> 18:13.013
IT'S ALL GOOD.
SEE YOU SOON.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.496
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I HAD A SHIFT

18:14.610 --> 18:15.634
AND I SHIFTED IT
RIGHT AROUND.

18:15.740 --> 18:17.628
- THAT'S AMAZING.
DO YOU WANT AN AWARD MAYBE?

18:17.750 --> 18:18.910
WELL, I'LL WORK ON THAT.

18:19.020 --> 18:20.294
- NO, NO, NO,
I DON'T WANT AN AWARD.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.472
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR SHIFT.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.195
PFFI'.

18:28.310 --> 18:30.722
YOU KNOW, SHE'S ACTING
LIKE I'VE BEEN THERE SO MUCH.

18:30.830 --> 18:32.969
- HOW MANY TIMES YOU BEEN OVER
SINCE SHE LEFT?

18:33.070 --> 18:34.173
- I'VE BEEN THERE THREE TIMES.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.349
- WELL, THREE TIMES
IS REALLY A LOT.

18:35.450 --> 18:36.348
IT'S HALF A WEEK, YOU KNOW.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.621
- THREE IS WAY LESS
THAN HALF A WEEK.

18:38.730 --> 18:39.799
A WEEK IS SEVEN DAYS.

18:39.910 --> 18:40.979
- WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

18:41.080 --> 18:44.459
YOU THINK IF YOU LET HER GO,
SHE'S NOT GONNA COME BACK?

18:44.570 --> 18:48.085
- IF I DIDN'T GO OVER THERE,
I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD.

18:48.190 --> 18:50.909
- I LET YOU GO.

18:51.020 --> 18:52.635
YOU CAME BACK.

18:56.340 --> 18:59.093
[Simon & Garfunkel's
Ceciliaplays]

19:04.240 --> 19:06.208
- CECILIA

19:06.310 --> 19:08.756
YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART

19:08.870 --> 19:10.724
- HEY, UM--

19:10.830 --> 19:12.411

19:12.530 --> 19:14.009
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

19:14.110 --> 19:15.862
- OKAY, SORRY.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.835
- UM, NOTHING I WAS JUST--

19:18.950 --> 19:20.042
HOW WERE THE RECORDS?

19:20.150 --> 19:21.879
- OH, WELL, THEY'RE GREAT.
- NICE.

19:21.980 --> 19:23.186
- I MEAN, I TRIED
THE FIRST FEW,

19:23.300 --> 19:24.608
AND THEY WERE
KIND OF SCRATCHED BUT...

19:24.710 --> 19:27.326
- OH, SORRY.
- NO, NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.601
I MEAN, I'LL TRY THE OTHERS.
I'M SURE THEY'RE FINE.

19:29.720 --> 19:34.123
- I GUESS YOU GET
WHAT YOU PAY FOR, RIGHT?

19:34.240 --> 19:35.787
WELL, THEY WERE FREE.

19:35.890 --> 19:38.336
UM, HEY, I KNOW THIS
IS REALLY, REALLY RANDOM,

19:38.450 --> 19:41.305
BUT FLEET FOXES,
IF YOU EVEN LIKE THEM,

19:41.420 --> 19:43.172
ARE PLAYING AT THE FOX
IN OAKLAND.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.269
- OH, YEAH.
YEAH, I KNOW.

19:44.390 --> 19:45.960
YEAH, ACTUALLY I SAW THEM

19:46.080 --> 19:47.559
LAST WEEKEND
WITH MY COUSIN

19:47.660 --> 19:48.695
IN SANTA BARBARA.

19:48.800 --> 19:49.869
- OKAY.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.379
COOL.
NEVER MIND.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.456
- YEAH, THEY WERE GREAT.
THEY WERE SO AMAZING.

19:53.570 --> 19:54.707
IT WAS SUCH
AN INCREDIBLE SHOW.

19:54.810 --> 19:56.903
- I'VE HEARD THEY'RE
REALLY GOOD LIVE.

19:57.020 --> 19:59.705
- YEAH, WELL, THEY ARE,
SO...

19:59.810 --> 20:01.914
- UM...

20:02.020 --> 20:04.671
- SO, UM...

20:04.780 --> 20:09.160
ARE YOU DOING
SOME GARDENING OR...

20:09.270 --> 20:11.613
- UM, NO, I'M NOT.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.278
UM, APPARENTLY MY GRANDFATHER

20:13.380 --> 20:14.540
BORROWED THESE FROM YOUR DAD.

20:14.660 --> 20:16.480
SO I WAS SUPPOSED
TO RETURN THEM.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.727
- OH.
- I'LL JUST PUT THEM--

20:17.830 --> 20:19.036
- WAIT, WAIT.

20:19.140 --> 20:20.584
- WHOA.

20:47.860 --> 20:48.827
HOLD IT.

20:48.930 --> 20:49.612
WAIT IT A MINUTE.
HOLD IT.

20:49.730 --> 20:51.379
HOW'D IT GO?

20:51.490 --> 20:53.412
- WHAT?
HOW DID WHAT GO?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.101
- THE THING WITH AMY ELLIS.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.939
YOU KNOW,
YOU OLD CONVERSATION.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.109
- I DIDN'T GO WELL.

20:58.220 --> 21:00.279
- HOLD ON.
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:00.390 --> 21:02.426
- THE RECORDS THAT
WE GAVE HER WERE SCRATCHED,

21:02.530 --> 21:05.351
AND SHE'S ALREADY
SEEN FLEET FOXES SOMEHOW,

21:05.470 --> 21:06.914
AND I DIDN'T EVEN
COMPLIMENT HER

21:07.020 --> 21:08.601
OR SAY ANYTHING REALLY

21:08.710 --> 21:10.359
BECAUSE I WAS STANDING THERE
WITH HEDGE CLIPPERS

21:10.470 --> 21:11.573
THE WHOLE TIME,

21:11.680 --> 21:13.329
WHICH I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.919
AND THEN I FINALLY
TRIED TO GIVE THEM TO HER,

21:15.030 --> 21:16.816
AND HER DOG RAN AWAY.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.056
- OH, WOW.
- SO THANKS.

21:18.170 --> 21:19.614
- WELL, NO, HEY!

21:19.720 --> 21:21.278
WE LOST THE BA'ITLE.
WE DIDN'T LOSE THE WAR.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.439
WE JUST RELOAD,
WE FIRE AGAIN, SON.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.517
- THAT WAS THE SCARIEST
THING I'VE EVER DONE,

21:24.620 --> 21:25.723
AND IT WENT HORRIBLY.

21:25.830 --> 21:27.695
I MEAN, HER DOG
IS PROBABLY DEAD,

21:27.800 --> 21:28.869
AND IT'S MY FAULT.

21:28.970 --> 21:31.109
SO THERE'S NO WAY
SHE'S GONNA DATE ME

21:31.220 --> 21:32.528
OR GO OUT WITH ME.

21:32.630 --> 21:34.518
- OH, PLEASE, I DON'T THINK
HER DOG IS DEAD.

21:34.630 --> 21:35.528
LET'S GO LOOKING
FOR THE DOG.

21:35.630 --> 21:38.394
WE FIND THE DOG,
WE BRING THE DOG BACK,

21:38.500 --> 21:39.660
WE'RE HEROES, HUH?

21:39.780 --> 21:40.917
COME ON!

21:42.990 --> 21:45.811
[knock at door]

21:56.000 --> 21:58.093
- ALEX.

21:58.210 --> 21:59.962
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

22:00.070 --> 22:02.482
- YOU TELL ME.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.765
- COME ON IN.

22:07.870 --> 22:08.837
- THANK YOU.

22:08.940 --> 22:10.282

22:10.390 --> 22:12.802
EXCUSE THE--THE MESS.

22:12.910 --> 22:13.774
CAN I, UH--

22:13.880 --> 22:15.461
- IT'S A NICE PLACE.
- CAN I GET--THANKS.

22:15.570 --> 22:16.468
CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK OR--

22:16.570 --> 22:18.606
- NO, I'M GOOD.

22:18.710 --> 22:21.577
- SO YOU TALKED TO HADDIE?

22:21.680 --> 22:23.124
- I DID.

22:27.820 --> 22:30.641
- SHE TOLD YOU
ABOUT MY PAST?

22:30.760 --> 22:32.512
- SHE DID.

22:35.830 --> 22:36.649
- MR. BRAVERMAN,

22:36.760 --> 22:39.149
I WILL NEVER DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT AGAIN.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.718
IT WAS--
I WAS IN A ROUGH SPOT.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.694
AND I'M SORRY.

22:43.810 --> 22:46.005
- WELL, LISTEN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE TO ME.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.769
- YES, I DO.

22:50.780 --> 22:53.465
- OKAY, WELL, LISTEN,
I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR THAT.

22:53.570 --> 22:57.950
- YOU WANT ME
TO STOP SEEING HADDIE?

22:59.100 --> 23:01.614
- LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW

23:01.720 --> 23:05.167
EXACTLY WHAT TO DO,

23:05.280 --> 23:10.138
BUT I'M HERE BECAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE--

23:13.460 --> 23:17.100
WELL, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

23:17.220 --> 23:19.381
KRISTINA AND I DISCUSSED IT,

23:19.500 --> 23:22.731
AND WE WOULD LIKE
TO OFFER OUR HELP.

23:25.230 --> 23:27.778
- THANK YOU.

23:27.880 --> 23:31.190
I JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING THAT YOU GUYS CAN DO.

23:31.300 --> 23:34.542
I'M 20 YEARS OLD, BLACK,

23:34.650 --> 23:37.926
AND I HIT A WHITE TEENAGER.

23:38.030 --> 23:39.759
I HAVE A RECORD.

23:39.860 --> 23:42.067
NOW I HAVE AN ASSAULT
AND BA'ITERY CHARGE.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.444
- RIGHT.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.518

24:37.750 --> 24:39.570
- YES, THERE'S
SOMETHING WALKING.

24:39.680 --> 24:40.886
- WELL, LET'S
JUST GO IN THERE

24:40.990 --> 24:42.434

25:06.400 --> 25:07.879
- I'M NOT SCARED.
- OH, MY GOD.

25:07.980 --> 25:09.493
- EWW, EWW, EWW.

25:09.610 --> 25:11.009
- I'M SCARED.

25:11.130 --> 25:12.779
- LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
IT'S SUCH A MESS.

25:12.890 --> 25:14.608
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
CAN WE SAVE IT FOR LATER?

25:14.720 --> 25:15.709
- YOU LEAVE ALL THIS CRAP OUT.

25:15.820 --> 25:17.219
- YEAH, OKAY,
THANKS, MOM.

25:17.340 --> 25:18.716
GREAT TEAMWORK.

25:21.760 --> 25:22.579
IT COULD BE IN THESE BOXES.

25:22.690 --> 25:23.918
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.

25:24.030 --> 25:25.850
- IT'S, LIKE,

25:37.630 --> 25:39.074
IT'S STANDING UP!

25:39.190 --> 25:40.589
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

25:40.710 --> 25:42.428
- OH, MY GOD!

25:42.540 --> 25:44.633
- THAT WAS THE HUGEST RAT
I'VE EVER SEEN.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.023
- SO WE JUST GOT BACK
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.609
I'M A BIT OF A CIVIL WAR BUFF.
- WE WENT TOGETHER.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.028
- LET'S TRY TO PUT IT OVER HERE.
- OH, I KNOW.

25:52.130 --> 25:53.859
- IT WAS WONDERFUL
BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE

25:53.960 --> 25:55.712
SOME TIME ALONE.
- OH, THAT'S SO CUTE.

25:55.830 --> 25:56.819
OH, MY GOD.
OH, HANG ON ONE SECOND.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.409
I HAVE A PHONE--
I HAVE TO TAKE A--

25:58.520 --> 26:00.829
I'M GOING.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

26:02.940 --> 26:05.249
OKAY, SAY HI

26:05.350 --> 26:07.489
HEY, BABE.

26:08.730 --> 26:09.697

26:09.800 --> 26:11.313

HOW ARE YOU?

26:11.430 --> 26:13.079
ARE YOU DRUNK?

26:13.190 --> 26:14.873
- I'M ALLOWED ONE GLASS.

26:14.980 --> 26:16.663
TO GET THROUGH THIS CRAP, I'M
ALLOWED A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE.

26:16.780 --> 26:17.565
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

26:17.670 --> 26:19.251

I'M NOT GONNA SHOW UP?

26:24.370 --> 26:26.406
- MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW.

26:26.510 --> 26:28.398
- OF COURSE I'M HERE.

26:28.510 --> 26:33.686
[cheers and applause]

26:33.790 --> 26:34.654

26:37.800 --> 26:39.313

26:39.420 --> 26:40.626
GRANDPA TELLS ME
YOU GOT YOUR EYE

26:40.730 --> 26:42.038
ON A GIRL
HERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

26:42.150 --> 26:43.902
WHAT'S THE SCOOP?
- YEP, I'M SURE HE DID.

26:44.010 --> 26:45.284
- IT'S NOT ONE OF THE NUSSBAUMS,
IS IT?

26:45.390 --> 26:46.425
- MMMM!
- OW!

26:46.530 --> 26:47.315
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

26:47.430 --> 26:49.591
YOU GUYS REMEMBER
SUZY NUSSBAUM?

26:49.710 --> 26:50.699
- NO.
- SUZY WAS WAY INTO ME.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.152
SHE WAS CRAZY ABOUT ME.

26:52.260 --> 26:53.363
- SHE'S NOT A NUSSBAUM.

26:53.470 --> 26:55.529
HER NAME'S AMY,
AND SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME AT ALL.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.323
SO...

26:57.440 --> 26:59.579
AND THE INTERNET'S DEAD,
SO...

26:59.680 --> 27:02.023

27:02.130 --> 27:05.133
I GET IT.
SORRY.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.582
SORRY.

27:06.690 --> 27:08.134

THE INTERNET OUT TOO?

27:08.240 --> 27:09.446

27:09.550 --> 27:10.756
HEY, BUDDY.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.003
ALL RIGHT, I'M CALLING
COINCIDENCE ON THAT.

27:17.110 --> 27:18.077

27:18.180 --> 27:19.738

IT'S THE WHEAT.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.114

27:24.290 --> 27:26.042

27:26.160 --> 27:27.775
ANYWAY, THE SMALL ONE'S

27:27.880 --> 27:29.017
AND THE BIG ONE'S
FOR KRISTINA.

27:29.130 --> 27:30.051
MAKE SURE SHE READS
THE CARD FIRST.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.775
- HOLD ON.
AREN'T YOU STAYING?

27:31.890 --> 27:32.959
- NO, NO.

27:33.060 --> 27:34.812
- YOU KNOW, I--
- YOU'RE INVITED.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.649
- IT'S A FAMILY THING.
I DON'T WANNA--

27:36.750 --> 27:38.502
- IT IS ANYTHING
BUT A FAMILY THING.

27:38.620 --> 27:40.099
LOOK AT ALL THESE
YOKELS HERE.

27:40.210 --> 27:42.098
AND YOU'RE FAMILY.

27:42.210 --> 27:44.656

FREE BOOZE.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.443
THE GAME'S ON.
I KNOW YOU LIKE FREE BOOZE.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.652
- [laughs]

27:47.760 --> 27:50.649
I DO, BUT I HAVE
TO BE SOMEWHERE.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.170
- LIKE A--
LIKE A HAIR APPOINTMENT?

27:53.290 --> 27:55.838
OR LIKE MEETING SOMEBODY?

27:55.950 --> 27:58.145
- [laughs]
YOU ARE NOT GONNA GO THERE.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.249
- WHAT?

27:59.360 --> 28:00.702
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.118
I THINK YOU HAVE A CRUSH
ON DR. JOE,

28:02.230 --> 28:03.709
AND I THINK DR. JOE
HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.

28:03.820 --> 28:05.321
- I'M GOING TO LOOK
AT WINDOW TREATMENTS

28:05.440 --> 28:06.668
WITH MY MOTHER.

28:06.780 --> 28:07.815
WHAT'S YOUR OBSESSION
WITH DR. JOE ANYWAY?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.649
- I DON'T KNOW,
HE'S GORGEOUS AND SMART.

28:09.750 --> 28:10.717
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHY I'M INTIMIDATED.

28:10.820 --> 28:11.957
- WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
DATE HIM THEN.

28:12.060 --> 28:13.334
- MAYBE I WILL
IF HE CALLS ME.

28:13.450 --> 28:14.303
- WELL, GO AHEAD.
- ALL RIGHT.

28:14.410 --> 28:15.752
- HAVE FUN.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.135
- HE'LL HAVE ME ON
A NO WHEAT DIET THOUGH.

28:20.870 --> 28:22.963
- OKAY, NO, NO, THIS ONE.
THIS IS FROM NATALIE.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.650
- OKAY, I'D LIKE
TO MAKE A TOAST HERE.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.829
- TO ADAM AND KRISTINA,

28:26.940 --> 28:29.761
TRULY REMARKABLE PARENTS.
THEY'RE AMAZING.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.142
- HEAR, HEAR.

28:31.260 --> 28:32.488
- AND TO OUR LITTLE
BABY BRAVERMAN.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.635
- ALL RIGHT.

28:33.740 --> 28:35.321
- WHO I HOPE IS GOING
TO BE NAMED BLANCHE

28:35.430 --> 28:36.738
AFTER HER GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.

28:36.850 --> 28:37.566
- OH, GOD.
- YEAH, THERE'S AN IDEA.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.193
- NO, NO, NO,
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.847
- MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,
I'D LIKE TO SAY HOW PROUD

28:40.960 --> 28:43.406
CAMILLE AND I ARE
TO HAVE OUR FAMILY

28:43.510 --> 28:44.738
GATHERED AROUND US.

28:44.860 --> 28:46.578
IT'S REALLY
QUITE EXTRAORDINARY.

28:46.690 --> 28:48.089
AN AMAZING FAMILY.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.929
- IT'S TRUE.

28:50.030 --> 28:51.349
- CAMILLE, THANK YOU
FOR PU'ITING ON

28:51.450 --> 28:52.678
THIS LOVELY, LOVELY SHOWER.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.347
- YAY, MOM.
- A TOAST!

28:54.450 --> 28:55.678
- TOAST.
- OKAY, CHEERS.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.620
- WE HAVE A LOT OF PRESENTS
TO GET THROUGH.

28:57.730 --> 28:59.584
- LET'S GET THE BOYS TOGETHER,
OKAY?

28:59.700 --> 29:00.724
- OH, MY GOSH, YES.
- I WOULD LOVE THAT.

29:00.840 --> 29:01.738
- TELL NOEL HI.
- OKAY.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.694
- OKAY, DRIVE SAFE.
BYE, BYE.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.835
- SEE YOU.
- SEE YOU.

29:08.950 --> 29:11.703
- WHEN PEACE

29:11.810 --> 29:16.019
LIKE A RIVER

29:16.130 --> 29:17.711
- HEY, HON.
- HEY, HONEY.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.435
- YOU GOOD?
- I'M GOOD.

29:19.550 --> 29:21.711
- HI.
- OOH.

29:21.820 --> 29:23.788
- AND SORROWS

29:23.900 --> 29:27.688
LIKE SEA BILLOWS ROLL

29:31.830 --> 29:36.767
WHATEVER MY LOT

29:36.870 --> 29:42.706
THOU HAS TAUGHT ME
TO SAY

29:42.810 --> 29:44.118
- WELL, I KNOW,
BUT IT'S BEEN--

29:44.230 --> 29:46.152
EVEN IN THE SIX YEARS
THAT SYDNEY'S BEEN ALIVE--

29:46.260 --> 29:51.436
- IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL

29:51.540 --> 29:53.098
- YES, IT'S NOT FAIR.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.612
- THERE'S JUST A LOT MORE
TO DEAL WITH, MAN.

29:55.720 --> 29:56.812
AND TO START OFF--

29:56.930 --> 29:59.683
TO START OFF, YOU'RE GONNA
NEED A LOT OF MONEY.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.371
AND I KNOW WHO
IT'S GONNA COME FROM.

30:01.480 --> 30:04.347
- WHO IS IT GONNA COME FROM?

30:04.450 --> 30:05.826
- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

30:05.940 --> 30:06.929
- WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU
TO GIVE ANY MONEY.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.621
- NO, GOD, NO.
WE HAVE A LOAN.

30:08.730 --> 30:10.038
WE'LL--WE'LL BE FINE.

30:10.150 --> 30:11.765
- YOU HAVE A LOAN FROM?

30:11.870 --> 30:13.622
- WELL, I MEAN,
WE DON'T HAVE ONE YET.

30:13.740 --> 30:15.014
BUT WE'LL HAVE ONE SOON.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.281
- RIGHT, AND HOW MUCH
DOES THE LOAN COVER?

30:17.400 --> 30:19.732
DO YOU KNOW?

30:19.850 --> 30:21.704
- EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE SECOND.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.050
I HAVE A FEELING SOMEONE
WANTS TO TALK TO ME.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.956
HI.

30:31.070 --> 30:33.026
ARE YOU MAD AT ME
ABOUT SOMETHING?

30:33.140 --> 30:35.779
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH
ABOUT RECORDING STUDIOS,

30:37.760 --> 30:39.580
WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO
EVERY SINGLE DAY,

30:39.690 --> 30:41.510
BUT SOMEHOW YOU'VE MANAGED
TO CONVINCE MY HUSBAND,

30:41.630 --> 30:42.767
WHO'S PRETTY CONSERVATIVE,

30:42.870 --> 30:44.098
THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY
A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

30:44.220 --> 30:45.869
AND I'M
A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED.

30:45.980 --> 30:47.595
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT
RIDING ON THIS.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.634
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS
A BIG GAMBLE WITH MY FAMILY.

30:49.740 --> 30:51.731
I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT'S ABOUT
TO GO TO COLLEGE NEXT YEAR.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.989
I HAVE A SON
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

30:54.090 --> 30:57.947
AND I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY,
SO I'M WORRIED.

30:58.060 --> 31:00.153
- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR TEN YEARS.

31:00.270 --> 31:01.578
I'VE WORKED WITH
HUNDREDS OF ARTISTS

31:01.680 --> 31:02.476
THAT WANNA WORK
WITH ME AGAIN.

31:02.580 --> 31:05.026
- WE'RE NOT HAVING
A CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.

31:05.130 --> 31:06.267
THIS IS THE END OF IT.

31:06.380 --> 31:09.759
ALL I'M ASKING YOU
IS TO NOT SCREW UP.

31:09.860 --> 31:11.441
- OKAY.
- THAT'S IT.

31:11.550 --> 31:12.756
NOW, I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND GO PEE.

31:12.870 --> 31:13.859
- OKAY.
DO YOU NEED--

31:13.970 --> 31:17.451
- I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
I'M GOOD.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.289
IT WAS A GOOD LI'ITLE CHAT.
- GOOD TALK.

31:19.390 --> 31:20.903
- YEAH, THAT'S--
- YOU'RE NOT MAD THOUGH, RIGHT?

31:21.010 --> 31:23.387
- NOPE, NOT AT ALL.
- OKAY, JUST CONCERNED.

31:29.710 --> 31:32.634
[doorbell chimes]

31:40.580 --> 31:42.821
- HI.

31:42.930 --> 31:44.579
ZACH?

31:44.690 --> 31:46.612
- CAN I HELP YOU?

31:46.730 --> 31:48.823
- YEAH, I'M ADAM BRAVERMAN.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.589
HADDIE'S DAD.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.861
- OH.

31:52.980 --> 31:56.552
- YOUR PARENTS AT HOME?

31:56.670 --> 31:59.764
THANK YOU.

31:59.880 --> 32:03.111
- WELCOME.
- THANK YOU.

32:03.230 --> 32:06.882
I DON'T WANNA DEFEND WHAT ALEX
DID OR MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIM.

32:06.990 --> 32:08.639
HE MADE A MISTAKE,
AND HE KNOWS HE DID.

32:08.750 --> 32:09.910
AND HE FEELS SORRY FOR IT,

32:10.030 --> 32:11.167
AND BOTH MY WIFE AND I
ARE SORRY

32:11.270 --> 32:13.261
THAT HE HIT YOUR SON.

32:13.370 --> 32:15.338
AND SHE WISHES SHE COULDA
BEEN HERE, BY THE WAY,

32:15.450 --> 32:18.203
BUT SHE'S, UH,
GONNA HAVE A BABY SOON.

32:18.310 --> 32:21.302
WASN'T FEELING WELL, SO...

32:21.420 --> 32:25.379
ANYWAY, REGARDING ALEX,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE HEARD

32:25.490 --> 32:28.414
ABOUT HIM THROUGH THE RUMOR MILL
OR WHATEVER BUT--

32:28.530 --> 32:30.179
- WELL, WE KNOW
WHAT THE D.A. HAS TOLD US.

32:30.290 --> 32:32.008
- OH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.075
I MEAN, HE DOESN'T GO TO
THE KIDS' HIGH SCHOOL, SO...

32:33.190 --> 32:34.350
- HE NEVER EVEN WENT
TO HIGH SCHOOL.

32:34.460 --> 32:35.779
- NO, THAT'S
NOT TRUE ACTUALLY.

32:35.880 --> 32:36.972
HE DID GO TO HIGH SCHOOL.

32:37.090 --> 32:38.637
HE JUST DIDN'T GRADUATE
WITH HIS CLASS.

32:38.740 --> 32:39.672
HE GOT HIS G.E.D.

32:39.780 --> 32:41.327
GOT IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
I THINK.

32:41.440 --> 32:42.816
- G.E.D. OR NOT,

32:42.920 --> 32:45.502
THIS KID ASSAULTED MY SON,

32:45.610 --> 32:50.570
AND HE IS GOING TO BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ACTIONS.

32:53.620 --> 32:55.963
- OKAY.

33:00.110 --> 33:03.238
MY DAUGHTER HADDIE
MET ALEX LAST SUMMER

33:03.360 --> 33:06.761
WHILE SHE WAS WORKING
AT A SOUP KITCHEN

33:06.880 --> 33:09.019
WHERE MY MOM
VOLUNTEERS TIME.

33:09.120 --> 33:13.841
AND ALEX WORKS THERE TOO.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.679
AND WHEN MY WIFE
AND I FOUND OUT

33:15.780 --> 33:17.987
THAT HADDIE
WAS DATING ALEX,

33:18.090 --> 33:20.297
WE WERE BOTH
VERY AGAINST IT.

33:20.410 --> 33:23.789
AND I AM EMBARRASSED
TO SAY THAT...

33:23.890 --> 33:26.165
[sighs]

33:26.280 --> 33:28.783
THE INITIAL INFORMATION
ABOUT HIM, IT JUST--

33:28.900 --> 33:29.798
IT JUST--IT SCARED US.

33:29.900 --> 33:31.208
- DID YOU KNOW
HE HAD A RECORD?

33:31.310 --> 33:33.005
- NO, WE DIDN'T.
WE FOUND THAT OUT RECENTLY,

33:33.110 --> 33:34.623
AND IT SHOCKED US
BECAUSE OF THE ALEX

33:34.730 --> 33:37.790
THAT WE'VE COME TO KNOW.
THIS IS A GOOD KID.

33:37.910 --> 33:42.563
THIS IS A GUY WHO IS TRYING
VERY HARD TO CHANGE HIS LIFE.

33:42.670 --> 33:45.116
IN FACT, THE FIRST TIME
HE WENT TO THAT SOUP KITCHEN,

33:45.230 --> 33:46.538
IT WAS TO GET
A HOT MEAL.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.949
HE WAS HOMELESS,

33:49.060 --> 33:50.914
AND NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT,
HE RUNS THE PLACE.

33:51.020 --> 33:52.908
HE'S 20 YEARS OLD,
AND HE'S THE BOSS.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.713
AND HE RUNS THAT SOUP KITCHEN
REALLY WELL.

33:54.820 --> 33:55.548
HE'S A RESPONSIBLE GUY,

33:55.650 --> 33:57.925
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW HARD HE TRIES

33:58.030 --> 34:00.021
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

34:00.140 --> 34:01.402
LOOK, I'M SORRY
THAT HE HIT YOUR SON.

34:01.520 --> 34:03.829
I REALLY AM.

34:06.350 --> 34:08.898
BUT HE SHOWED UP AT THAT PARTY
COMPLETELY SOBER,

34:09.010 --> 34:10.079
AND QUITE FRANKLY THERE WAS

34:10.180 --> 34:11.624
A LOT OF UNDERAGE
DRINKING GOING ON,

34:11.730 --> 34:12.901
AND ALL HE AS DOING
WAS TRYING TO BRING

34:13.010 --> 34:14.762
MY DAUGHTER HADDIE
HOME SAFELY.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.734
BUT ALEX HAS
A PREVIOUS RECORD,

34:16.840 --> 34:19.729
AND HE COULD GO TO JAIL
IF YOU PRESS CHARGES, SO...

34:19.850 --> 34:20.942
HE DOESN'T DESERVE THAT.

34:21.050 --> 34:21.869
HE DOESN'T DESERVE
TO GO TO JAIL.

34:21.990 --> 34:25.539
HE'S JUST TOO GOOD AND
DECENT A PERSON.

34:25.640 --> 34:28.200
AND I DON'T WANNA SEE
HIS LIFE DESTROYED.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.549
[knock on door]
- YEP?

34:43.420 --> 34:44.830
- THIS IS GE'ITING RIDICULOUS.

34:44.940 --> 34:47.215
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE YOUR
LATTE, SO HERE, OKAY?

34:47.320 --> 34:49.003
ON THE HOUSE,
NO MORE RUNNING AROUND.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.668
STOP BEING CRAZY,
ALL RIGHT?

34:51.770 --> 34:54.705
- ZOE, ZOE.

34:54.810 --> 34:56.038
COME HERE, PLEASE.

34:56.160 --> 34:58.469
UM...

35:03.680 --> 35:06.740
I'VE BEEN FEELING
LIKE AN IDIOT

35:06.860 --> 35:09.408
FOR WHAT I DID, SO, UM--

35:09.520 --> 35:13.581
- YOU'RE JUST AVOIDING ME?

35:13.690 --> 35:17.274
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

35:17.390 --> 35:19.449
HEY, HAVE A SEAT.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.699
LET ME...

35:22.840 --> 35:24.421
LISTEN, I JUST--

35:24.530 --> 35:27.215
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I WASN'T JUST HELPING YOU

35:27.330 --> 35:30.561
BECAUSE OF SOME
ULTERIOR MOTIVE.

35:30.680 --> 35:33.911
ALTHOUGH, OKAY, THERE WAS
AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE THERE.

35:34.020 --> 35:37.228
BUT I ALSO WANTED
TO HELP YOU.

35:37.340 --> 35:40.810
AND I DO STILL
WANNA HELP YOU.

35:40.930 --> 35:43.649
- DO YOU WANNA WHY I SAID NO?

35:45.480 --> 35:46.378
WHATEVER.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

35:46.480 --> 35:47.924
- NO, I WOULD--
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO--

35:48.040 --> 35:50.793
YES, PLEASE, TELL ME.

35:53.590 --> 35:54.830
- OKAY.

35:54.940 --> 35:58.694
WELL, I WANT
A CLOSED ADOPTION.

36:07.540 --> 36:11.408
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST
SO HARD ALREADY, YOU KNOW.

36:11.510 --> 36:13.887
AND THE THOUGHT OF, LIKE,

36:13.990 --> 36:18.165
HANDING MY BABY OVER
TO SOMEONE THAT I KNOW JUST--

36:18.270 --> 36:23.105
SOMEONE THAT I LIKE,
JUST I CAN'T.

36:23.210 --> 36:25.861
SO I JUST FEEL LIKE

36:25.970 --> 36:29.599
A CLEAN BREAK
WOULD BE EASIER.

36:29.700 --> 36:31.144
- MM-HMM.

36:31.250 --> 36:33.491
- GOD, THAT SOUNDS
SO TERRIBLE.

36:33.600 --> 36:34.669
- NO.

36:34.770 --> 36:38.319
HEY.

36:38.430 --> 36:41.319
ZOE, THAT DOESN'T SOUND
TERRIBLE.

36:41.440 --> 36:45.774
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND
THAT ACTUALLY.

36:45.890 --> 36:47.050
I REALLY DO.

36:47.170 --> 36:48.649
- OKAY.

36:48.750 --> 36:49.921
- OKAY?

36:53.650 --> 36:55.618
- COULD YOU
DO SOMETHING FOR ME?

36:55.730 --> 36:56.515
- OKAY.

36:56.620 --> 36:58.622
- COULD YOU START
BUYING MORE COFFEE?

36:58.730 --> 36:59.867
- YES.

36:59.970 --> 37:01.380
I WILL HAPPILY
BUY MORE COFFEE.

37:01.490 --> 37:05.142
I WILL SEE YOU IN AN HOUR.

37:05.250 --> 37:06.319
- MMM, 20 MINUTES.

37:06.430 --> 37:07.977
- NO, I'M NOT THAT BAD.
45.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.593
- YOU ACTUALLY ARE THAT BAD.

37:09.710 --> 37:11.428
MY BOSS IS THINKING
THAT I'M STEALING,

37:11.530 --> 37:13.225
MY NUMBERS ARE SO LOW.

37:13.330 --> 37:14.422

37:14.540 --> 37:15.700
I'LL SEE YOU IN 20 MINUTES.

37:48.850 --> 37:49.805

37:54.510 --> 37:56.193

38:03.660 --> 38:05.616
UH, JASMINE,
I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING,

38:05.730 --> 38:08.369

38:11.700 --> 38:13.247
THAT I'VE EVER DONE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

38:13.360 --> 38:16.318
AND I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS
ABOUT IT.

38:16.430 --> 38:17.977
AND IF YOU'RE--

38:18.080 --> 38:19.320

IF THIS IS ABOUT
THE RECORDING STUDIO,

41:34.210 --> 41:35.438
I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT IT.
