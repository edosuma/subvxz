00:02.750 --> 00:04.000
Nick!

00:04.500 --> 00:06.041
What has gotten into you?

00:06.125 --> 00:10.208
You just seem different this summer.
Good different.

00:10.291 --> 00:11.500
[laughs]

00:11.583 --> 00:13.291
Well, I talked to my director

00:13.417 --> 00:15.542
about who should play
my love interest in <i>Forever April,</i>

00:15.625 --> 00:18.041
<i>and she wants a Joe from Jonas type.</i>

00:18.125 --> 00:20.500
There's a roomful of me's in there
and I'm freaking out right now.

00:20.583 --> 00:22.583
-Action.
-I'm a ghost.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.750
Ghosts can't love.

00:24.834 --> 00:27.959
If we never try, then we'll
never know what could have been.

00:28.041 --> 00:29.917
-And cut.
-I got the part!

00:31.542 --> 00:34.375
-Here you go, man. I made you breakfast.
-Wow. Thanks, dude.

00:34.458 --> 00:36.291
No problem.
Feeling good? Feeling loose?

00:36.375 --> 00:38.333
Feeling awesome.
I'm going to be in a movie today.

00:38.417 --> 00:40.083
Not just any movie!

00:40.166 --> 00:42.083
From the best-selling novel,
<i>Forever April,</i>

00:42.166 --> 00:45.959
comes the major motion picture event,
starring my brother, Joe.

Dude, no sausage.

00:48.333 --> 00:51.834
In a world with no sausage,
one man--

00:51.917 --> 00:53.750
Tells his brother
to stop talking like that.

00:53.834 --> 00:57.375
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Hey, let's practice your lines.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.959
Kevin, we've been practicing all weekend.
I'm pretty solid.

01:01.041 --> 01:03.625
OK, then you wouldn't care
if I did this...

01:03.709 --> 01:08.291
Scene 36, interior, high school gymnasium,
your character, Dade, is alone.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.166
The ghost April appears. She says,

[high-pitched]
"Dade, you're not safe here.

01:12.875 --> 01:16.250
-you have to go."
-"I'm not going anywhere without you."

01:16.333 --> 01:18.333
-Nailed it!
-See? Solid.

01:18.417 --> 01:22.000
-Now do it backwards.
-You without anywhere going not I'm.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.709
You are going to be a great actor.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.041
And you are going to be a great director.
Director Kevin?

01:26.125 --> 01:27.959
-Yes, actor Joe?
-What time is it?

01:28.041 --> 01:31.667
-Seven-thirty.
-And what time do I have to be on set?

01:33.083 --> 01:35.083

Relax, OK? We're a little bit lost,
we're a little bit late...

Look at this place!
We are not in Jersey anymore.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.250
Kevin, I was supposed to be
in makeup, like, yesterday.

nothing starts on time.

03:06.834 --> 03:10.000
You're late. Who said you could be late
to a Mona Klein set?

03:10.959 --> 03:12.792
-He did.
-Hi, Ms. Klein, I'm Kevin.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.750
I'm Joe's brother.
Also a director!

03:14.834 --> 03:17.709
-Well, aspiring. But I'm just a big fan.
-Zip it!

You, sit down while I decide
how I'm gonna punish you.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.750
-It won't happen again.
-No kidding.

for being late.

I am now April.

-What?
-Dade, is that you?

04:01.875 --> 04:04.458
Joe, this is a technique
some actors use to prepare.

04:04.542 --> 04:07.625
They become the character
even when the cameras aren't rolling.

04:07.709 --> 04:09.750
Dade, am I visible?

I can communicate with and I need...

04:40.834 --> 04:43.583
Depends on the two people.

I have a big date tonight.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.166
And, oh, this is real velour,

05:08.250 --> 05:10.583
so if you were to, uh, you know,
rate my look

05:10.667 --> 05:12.417
on a scale of jamming to slamming?

05:13.875 --> 05:16.458
-Um...
-You hate it.

Uh, DZ, you're hair's really sharp.

Oh, sorry.
I must have over-gelled.

OK, DZ, back away from the Jonas.

Whatever is going on,
it can't be that bad.

The... the truth is,
I'm not the player you think I am.

05:35.125 --> 05:37.583
And I've never been on a date before.
There, I said it.

-That is a huge shock.
-[softly] Yeah.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.500
-But it's gonna be OK.
-It's not gonna be OK. All right?

05:43.583 --> 05:45.792
I'm meeting Andrea tonight.
My threads are busted,

05:45.875 --> 05:50.208
-and this bling is giving me a rash.
-OK, I can help you.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.417
But you're gonna have
to do it my way, understand?

05:52.500 --> 05:55.125
-Yeah, where do we start?
-Follow me. Let's go.

06:02.625 --> 06:03.917

Oh, thanks for letting me
practice on you, Stella-bell.

You know, I think massage
is my true calling.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.917
I do.
I know I said that about acting.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.375
And candle-making.

-And landscaping.
-Hey, it's a free massage. I'm in.

a pretty penny for this,

you've only massaged, say, a cat?

Stop saying that.
I'm a mess.

-Just try and relax.
-Maybe I just don't belong here.

What does this chair say?

-It says "Joe."
-Yes, exactly.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.208
"Joe," not Lou, not Ed, but Joe.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.875
They wouldn't give you a chair with your
name on it if you didn't belong here.

-Who's Ed?
-I'm trying to make a point.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.750
You're fine saying the lines with just me.

-Hi, Mona.

You just pop up all over the place,
don't you?

10:05.583 --> 10:08.208
Yeah. I think I figured out
what Joe's problem is.

-Oh, do tell.
-It's you.

10:11.709 --> 10:12.792
I'm the problem?

10:12.875 --> 10:15.667
Well, yeah, you have a way of
saying things that are scary and mean.

10:15.750 --> 10:18.333
Joe, on the other hand,
likes things that are soft and nice.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.125
-Oh, does he?
-If you could give him rewards,

10:21.208 --> 10:23.250
maybe like treats or snacks,
that could really help him.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.291
Bye-bye.

10:35.375 --> 10:38.291
-Wait, what happened?
-We talked. You're all good.

10:38.333 --> 10:42.041
-[screams]
<i>-What?</i> No.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.917
Come on, guys, I've gotta get back to set.
My brother needs me.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.208
[grunts]
Guys, come on!

10:50.041 --> 10:52.417
-[beeps]
-Joe, talk to me.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.333
Dude, why did Mona kick you off the set?

10:54.417 --> 10:57.041
Things were said.
It's not important. So, how you doing?

10:57.125 --> 10:59.875
I am freaking out.
You need to get back here.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.959
[Mona]
Picture's up. Where's Joe?

11:02.041 --> 11:04.917
-She coming.
-Joe? Joe!

11:07.834 --> 11:08.750
[tires screeching]

11:09.750 --> 11:10.709
I don't think so.

11:13.041 --> 11:15.417
Listen, my brother really needs me.
He's back there on set.

11:15.500 --> 11:19.917
And I need a three-hour foot massage,
followed by a four-hour foot massage.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.166
I think we're both gonna be disappointed.

11:25.041 --> 11:27.000
[piano chords playing]

11:27.083 --> 11:31.000
May I present the new
and majorly-improved DZ?

11:31.083 --> 11:32.959
Wow, DZ, is that really you?

11:33.041 --> 11:35.750
Holla! [chuckles]
Back up the cool bus.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.625
[imitates engine starting]

11:38.333 --> 11:40.375
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

11:40.458 --> 11:41.375
[beatboxes]

11:41.458 --> 11:42.750
Stop.

11:42.834 --> 11:45.291
-Whoo.
-Yep, still you.

11:45.583 --> 11:48.083
I forgot he still talks.
It really kills the look.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.583
Wait, wait, you guys think
I need more than this?

11:50.667 --> 11:55.000
Girls love a good dresser,
but the clothes are just the packaging.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.083
There's so much more
that we like in a guy.

11:57.166 --> 11:59.625
Uh-oh, Macy's about to
lay some knowledge on us, DZ.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.667
Oh, well, DZ's all ears.

12:01.709 --> 12:04.583
-Well, we like a guy with confidence.
-I reek of confidence.

12:04.667 --> 12:07.417
That's my body spray,
Confidence by Stone Stevens.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.542
Yeah, there's such a thing
as too much confidence.

12:11.125 --> 12:14.583
-Uh, we like it when you listen to us.
-Oh, like I said, all ears.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.875
-But still have your own opinions.
-Totally.

12:16.959 --> 12:19.333
-[whispers] About what?
-Oh, I know!

12:19.417 --> 12:21.041
We like a guy who can make us laugh...

12:21.125 --> 12:23.875
Well, I got this off the back
of a gum wrapper:

12:23.959 --> 12:26.875
Why don't seagulls fly by the bay?

12:28.625 --> 12:32.083
Because then they'd be called "bay-gulls."
[laughs]

12:32.166 --> 12:35.458
-Stop it.
-But not with jokes. I really hate jokes.

12:35.875 --> 12:38.291
[clears throat]
Come on, flying baked goods?

12:38.375 --> 12:40.417
DZ, just listen.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.583
Care about your family and your friends.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.959
And show the world
you have a beautiful spirit.

12:46.041 --> 12:48.166
And always, always chew
with your mouth closed.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.750
-Got it?
-Got it.

12:49.834 --> 12:51.625
Anything else?

12:51.709 --> 12:56.959
One more thing:
if you like a girl, you should tell her,

12:57.041 --> 13:00.500
so she's not confused
by the messages you're sending.

13:00.583 --> 13:03.792
Got it, processed.
Outskis. See ya.

13:05.917 --> 13:07.583
-You deserve a medal.
-Thank you.

13:07.667 --> 13:12.667
-[door opens, closes]
-So, anything I said surprise you at all?

13:12.750 --> 13:14.041
Or...?

13:14.417 --> 13:17.917
Jokes. I didn't know
they were a deal breaker.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.125
[exhales]

13:27.083 --> 13:29.250
Officer Evie, may I call you Evie?

13:29.333 --> 13:31.667
There has to be someone
in here you want to talk to.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.000
Matt Damon?

13:33.875 --> 13:35.500
Usher?
Kesha?

13:35.583 --> 13:38.959
I don't play like that.
You got Will Smith in there?

13:39.041 --> 13:40.959
-No.
-Oh, well!

13:41.041 --> 13:43.125
I guess we're stuck.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.625
Oh, no, that boy didn't just do that.

13:48.959 --> 13:51.917
[groans]
I had to wear the big heels today.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Boy!

13:53.875 --> 13:55.959
[Vanessa]
Why do you keep coming here?

13:56.041 --> 13:58.959
Nothing good ever happens
in this terrible place.

13:59.041 --> 14:03.166
-I just need to be close to you.
-No, you need to forget me.

14:04.041 --> 14:06.875
Try, Dade.
Pretend I never existed.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.041
Around all you feel can I but.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.333
[groans]
I just said it backwards.

14:14.417 --> 14:16.000
Cut!

14:16.500 --> 14:18.709
I can feel you all around.
I can feel you all around!

14:18.792 --> 14:19.625
See, I can say it.

14:19.709 --> 14:23.375
[sighs] What about a treat? Let me see,
what have I got in my pocket here?

14:23.458 --> 14:25.417
I've got some mints, a lipstick.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.750
I've got the number of the guy
that I rear-ended this morning.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.792
-I think I'm past treats.
-OK, so what can we do?

14:30.875 --> 14:34.375
-Maybe you hired the wrong guy.
-I don't make mistakes.

14:34.458 --> 14:37.500
I saw you onstage and you were electric!

14:37.583 --> 14:39.834
I'm 25 and you made me feel like I'm 12.

14:39.917 --> 14:41.917
-Twenty-five?
-Shh!

14:43.375 --> 14:47.166
Joe, you've sang in front
of thousands of people

14:47.250 --> 14:49.375
and made them feel
everything that you wanted to.

14:50.208 --> 14:51.750
Bring that guy here, all right?

14:51.834 --> 14:54.875
Find your inner rock star.
You can do it.

14:55.834 --> 14:57.166
OK, I'll try.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.417
Cue effects!
Music!

15:02.500 --> 15:05.542
-[ballad plays]
-And action!

15:05.625 --> 15:07.125
[Vanessa]
Why do you keep coming here?

15:07.208 --> 15:10.375
Nothing good ever happens
in this terrible place.

15:10.458 --> 15:14.417
-I just need to be close to you.
-No, you have to forget me.

15:14.542 --> 15:18.875
Try, Dade.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.458
That's awesome.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.333
See that actor?
That's my brother.

17:36.208 --> 17:38.041
-How was that?
-That was great.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.834
That was amazing!
Now, do you think you can say your lines

17:40.917 --> 17:42.917
as well as you sang them in that song?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.709
-Definitely.
-All right, let's go again.

17:52.542 --> 17:53.792
-Ow.
-Sorry.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.208
-Ow.
-Honey, you're just so tense.

17:56.291 --> 17:57.917
I mean... Oh, look,
you have a whole row

17:58.000 --> 17:59.792
-of knots back here.
-That's my spine!

17:59.875 --> 18:03.083
No, it's not! Here, let me just get
this one right here for you.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.333
-[cracks]
-Ooh, OK.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.291
Ow, ow, I can't.
I just can't.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.291
It hurts.
I can't feel my legs.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.792
-It's over.
-I knew it.

18:10.875 --> 18:14.417
Failed again.
I shouldn't even try.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.375
-Aunt Lisa.
-No, it's true, OK?

18:16.458 --> 18:19.709
Everything your mom said about me,
it's true.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.750
You know what Mom says about you?

18:22.834 --> 18:25.417
She says that...
that you're a sweet soul.

18:26.291 --> 18:29.041
And that you're
the best sister in the world.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.333
[soft chuckle]

18:30.417 --> 18:32.959
She trusted you to look out for me
while I'm in LA.

18:34.083 --> 18:37.333
-And I'm so glad that you're here.
-Aww.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.166
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:39.250 --> 18:42.125
You're a great aunt.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.792
-And you know what?
-Hmm?

18:43.875 --> 18:46.500
I think you could totally be
a great massage therapist.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.542
-Oh... I really think I could.
-There you go.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.458
-You know, just research it a little bit.
-Yeah.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.875
Maybe go online, and, uh,

18:54.959 --> 18:58.750
just learn about what feels good,
you know, for humans.

18:58.834 --> 19:02.834
Or I could become
a cat masseuse right now.

19:02.917 --> 19:04.834
Dealer's choice.

19:04.917 --> 19:09.041
You know, whatever you do,
I believe in you.

19:09.125 --> 19:12.625
Ohh, thanks, Stella-bell.

19:12.709 --> 19:13.542
-[cracking]
-[Stella groans]

19:13.625 --> 19:14.625
Oh, sorry.

19:14.709 --> 19:16.750
You know, I'm just...
I'm just gonna go.

19:20.834 --> 19:22.291
[Nick]
Ready for another lesson?

19:24.125 --> 19:25.375
No thanks.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.291
How about some "Three Blind Mice"?

19:28.375 --> 19:30.458
I hear it's a big hit
with the kids these days.

19:30.542 --> 19:31.917
I'm good.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.458
[sighs]

19:35.625 --> 19:36.709
Is something wrong?

19:38.083 --> 19:42.417
Nick, when I was telling DZ
all those things girls like in a guy,

19:42.500 --> 19:45.542
I was really talking about
all the things I like in a guy.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.542
You were?

19:48.125 --> 19:53.041
And if I, let's say, found this guy
who had all of those qualities,

19:53.125 --> 19:56.375
-I'd really hope that he'd like me, too.
-I'd hope so, too.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.125
-Ow.
-Nick, it was you.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.959
OK? I was describing you.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.625
-Forget it.
-Macy, wait.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.041
What?

20:07.875 --> 20:10.458
What I'm trying to say is I like you.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.917
And I've been wanting to tell you
ever since I saw you this summer.

20:14.750 --> 20:17.750
Well, there it is.
What took you so long?

20:17.834 --> 20:19.250
I guess I was just scared.

20:19.333 --> 20:22.750
Mm, if anyone should be scared, it's me.

20:22.875 --> 20:26.000
-Why?
-Because this is crazy.

20:26.083 --> 20:28.959
You're a rock star and I'm your--

20:29.041 --> 20:31.500
-Macy.
-I'm your Macy.

20:32.917 --> 20:36.667
-I like the sound of that.
-Me, too.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.125
This has been such a weird day.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.458
[sighs]
It feels good to be home.

20:41.542 --> 20:44.291
Do you guys think there's
such thing as a cat masseuse?

20:44.375 --> 20:46.125
I mean, this is LA,
so there probably is.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.417
There are like pet therapists
and pet psychics.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.083
That's crazy stuff.
So, what are we doing?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.166
Do you want to order in?
Like, I'm kind of hungry,

20:52.250 --> 20:54.000
but I'm kind of not hungry.
You know?

21:00.333 --> 21:03.166
Hey, Kev. Do you mind going over
tomorrow's lines with me?

21:03.208 --> 21:05.458
Actually, man, you rocked it today.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.917
I think when it comes to movies,
you're a solo act.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.792
-Plus, you're banned from the set.
-Yeah, that too.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.333
[DZ]
Holla!

21:12.792 --> 21:15.000
Oh, best date ever!

21:15.083 --> 21:18.000
-Only date ever.
-So, it went well?

21:18.125 --> 21:19.834
Oh, yeah, Andrea was
definitely feeling me.

21:19.917 --> 21:23.500
Aww, so you remembered all the stuff
I told you about how to act with a girl?

21:23.583 --> 21:24.834
Yeah.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.417
Kinda. I sort of blocked you out.

21:27.500 --> 21:28.417
[door shuts]

21:28.500 --> 21:29.583
Well, I can't wait to meet her.

21:29.709 --> 21:31.750
Yo, DZ, where you at?

21:31.834 --> 21:33.834
Peeps, Andrea; Andrea, peeps.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.208
What up, playas?

21:36.291 --> 21:37.917
Yo, we gotta scoot.
I promised your moms

21:38.000 --> 21:40.417
I'd have you back
to Casa DZ before curfew.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.333
OK.
We can just jump in the cool bus.

21:43.625 --> 21:46.041
[both]
Beep-beep-beep.

21:46.125 --> 21:49.166
[beatboxing]

21:50.542 --> 21:52.125
Come on...
