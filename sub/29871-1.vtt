Christmas was first celebrated
on December 25th in Rome

00:52.620 --> 00:55.788
in the year 336 under
the first Christian emperor,

00:55.856 --> 00:59.525
Emperor Constantine,
marking the winter solstice

00:59.593 --> 01:01.360
and at the Festival
of Saturnalia,

01:01.395 --> 01:04.396
the Romans feasted
and gave gifts to the poor.

01:04.465 --> 01:08.934
Okay, now this way, you will
see the Via De Condotti.

01:09.003 --> 01:10.669
It's an ancient
Roman thoroughfare

01:10.704 --> 01:13.472
that was rebuilt
in 1544 and is now

01:13.541 --> 01:16.642
one of the most fashionable
streets in all of Italy.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.644
It's a great place

Christmas shopping to do.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.673

were gluten free.

Yes, yeah, I did do that.

And the gladiator's
sword you lost

02:41.428 --> 02:42.995
at the Colosseum?

02:43.030 --> 02:44.396
Okay, I only borrowed
that sword to show

02:44.431 --> 02:46.598

we're supposed to be
on that street back there.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.926
Your phone can't help
navigate Rome at Christmas.

knowledge for that.

kind, but I insist.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.953
Have you ever done
business here before?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.690
No, why?

09:51.725 --> 09:53.458
In Italy, when someone
gives you a gift,

09:53.493 --> 09:54.726
you always accept it.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.494
Otherwise they think
you're being rude.

09:57.531 --> 09:58.763

I will not try to pay you again.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.567

10:02.603 --> 10:04.369
The business protocol
is not like the states.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.571
There are cultural differences.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.373

10:08.408 --> 10:10.175
Can't be that different,
a deal's a deal.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.077
Uh, you'd be surprised.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.245
Oh, you should know,
every meeting in Italy

10:14.281 --> 10:15.880

10:20.354 --> 10:21.486
Thank you.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.755
Mr. Oliver Martin from New York?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.290
Yes.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.325
I think you and I
have a meeting, no?

10:27.361 --> 10:30.295
Mr. Forlinghetti, it is a
pleasure to meet you, sir.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.097
The pleasure is mine.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.965
- And you are?
- Angela de Luca.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.600
She is a tour guide.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.102
I was just leaving.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.204
Please, join us.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.641
Oh, no, no, no, no, I...

10:42.709 --> 10:44.409
I insist.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.512
You can help us with our
cultural differences.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.716
You know what, I've
always wanted to eat here.

10:53.587 --> 10:54.653
Come.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.389
Must try the gnocchi.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.459
[upbeat music]

11:03.897 --> 11:05.897
Mr. Forlinghetti, thank
you for meeting with me

11:05.932 --> 11:07.132
on such short notice.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.733
Call me Luigi, please.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.069
I'm very glad you could
come all this way.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.905
Margaret and Jack
Fletcher are old friends.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.675
And they tell me wonderful
things about your company.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.243
Oh, thank you.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.377
I know you're a very busy man

11:19.413 --> 11:21.713
so I'll get right down to it.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.416
I understand that you are
considering the future
of your company.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.718
And I think that Fisk
Drummond can offer

11:26.753 --> 11:29.554
some very attractive terms.

11:29.589 --> 11:32.023
We have much time
to talk business.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.958
Our food is getting cold.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.026
Yes, of course, but I--

11:35.095 --> 11:36.895
[clears throat]

11:36.930 --> 11:39.964
This is Oliver's
first time in Rome.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.535
Mm, first time.

11:43.570 --> 11:47.272
I envy you because you can see
everything with fresh eyes.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.707
Yes, of course.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.477
Christmas in Rome
is very special.

11:52.512 --> 11:56.214
Yes, I was just enjoying the
Christmas nativity scene.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.716
Pre-cepi.

11:57.784 --> 11:58.917
Pre-cepi.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.118
Ah, si, si, pre-cepi.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.456
And how do you plan to
spend your time in Rome?

12:04.491 --> 12:07.625
Meeting with you or in
the hotel room working.

12:11.832 --> 12:12.797
That's all?

12:15.736 --> 12:19.370
Well, there was some...

12:19.406 --> 12:23.141
You are here a week
before Christmas

12:23.176 --> 12:25.243
and you don't explore the city?

12:25.278 --> 12:26.878
[speaking Italian]

12:26.913 --> 12:28.379
Oliver, weren't
you just telling me

12:28.448 --> 12:30.315
how you planned on
seeing the Colosseum

12:30.383 --> 12:32.751
and the beautiful
Christmas lights

12:32.819 --> 12:34.319
above the Spanish steps.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.788
Um-hmm, I was just
telling her that, right.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.590
And then there's the Parthenon.

12:40.827 --> 12:41.760
Pantheon.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.928
Parthenon's in Greece.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.831
Pantheon, Pantheon
is what I meant.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.233
I meant Pantheon.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.002
Oliver, the ceramics we make

12:51.037 --> 12:52.771
are made with love.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.874
This company has been in
the family for generations.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.944
Whoever will buy my
company must understand

12:59.980 --> 13:02.814
it is not just about the clay.

13:02.849 --> 13:06.417
It is about capturing the
spirit of Rome in the clay.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.155
Right, absolutely.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.457
Come by my factory
tomorrow afternoon.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.893
We can get to know
each other better

13:14.961 --> 13:17.228
and you can tell me all
you've seen of Rome.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.832
[speaking Italian]

13:20.867 --> 13:22.033
Now, let's eat.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.339
What just happened back there?

13:28.375 --> 13:31.843
I saved your pancetta.
It's bacon.

13:31.878 --> 13:35.280
Really, because it feels
like you volunteered me
for a book report on Rome.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.248
You have to remember, business
is done differently in Italy

13:37.284 --> 13:39.050
than in New York.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.585
At the end of the day,
it's about closing the deal

13:40.620 --> 13:42.387
and I'm here to
make that happen.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.156
Fine, but running in like
a bull in a china shop

13:45.192 --> 13:46.424
is not gonna impress anybody.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.426
How am I a bull in a china shop?

13:48.461 --> 13:49.994
You know what, I am
just trying to help.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.363
For the record, a lot
of people like my style.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.432
They say I'm a straight shooter.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.202
I'm sure they do.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.903
All right, listen,
merry Christmas

13:58.939 --> 14:00.872
and good luck.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.175
Ah, hang on.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.212
Wait.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.015
Can you help me find my hotel?

14:13.420 --> 14:16.087
[upbeat music]

14:22.195 --> 14:24.863
Well, here we are,
Hotel Katrini.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.031
Thank you.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.000
If you are ever in
New York, look me up,

14:29.069 --> 14:30.802
I will return the favor.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.670
Well, it was very
nice to meet you.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.672
And I really do hope you
enjoy the rest of your trip.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.040
Thank you, I appreciate it.

14:39.813 --> 14:44.649
Hey, what if I hired you to
be my tour guide for the week?

14:45.685 --> 14:47.452
What?

14:47.487 --> 14:51.189
I'm gonna be here
'til Christmas Eve.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.958
Got four days to give me
a crash course in Rome.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.426
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.329
I don't do crash courses
but thank you anyway.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.266
You said you were gonna start
your own business, right?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.134
I'll pay you double your fee.

15:03.169 --> 15:04.602
Think of it as a test run.

15:04.638 --> 15:07.605
Luigi already loves you
and he said he wanted me

15:07.674 --> 15:09.307
to get to know Rome.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.442
You could help me
see all the sights.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.579
It's not just about sights,
that's not what he meant.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.347
But that's what he said.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.585
Look, maybe I can help you.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.322
I'll do it on one condition.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.725
If I give you a tour,
you let me do it my way.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.994
Your way?
What exactly does that mean?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.997
I've always wanted to do a
real Christmas tour of Rome,

15:33.033 --> 15:34.899
something special
and meaningful.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.035
Sure, whatever,

15:37.070 --> 15:38.903
whatever you want to do.

15:38.972 --> 15:39.971
What do you say,
do we have a deal?

15:41.708 --> 15:44.542
All right, deal, great.

15:44.577 --> 15:45.543
Okay, first order of business,

15:45.612 --> 15:47.478
let's get you checked in.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.680
All right.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.382
[mellow music]

15:56.022 --> 15:58.356
It'll just be a minute.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.191
Oliver Martin!

16:00.226 --> 16:02.193
Margaret, hi.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.195
Hey, Jack.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.564
Hey, thank you so much for
the introduction to Luigi.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.900
Of course, seemed
like a good fit.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.635
And how are you
liking Rome so far?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.270
I love it, it's just
tough to get around.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.339
I would be lost
without my guide.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.407
Angela, meet Jack and
Margaret Fletcher.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.542
Merry Christmas.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.776
And you, dear.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.645
What tour company are you with?

16:20.680 --> 16:21.946
Ah...

16:21.982 --> 16:24.082
She's starting her own company.

16:24.117 --> 16:29.587
Private bespoke tours of Rome
for the discerning traveler.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.856
A private tour guide.
I like the sound of that.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.858
What's your company called?

16:33.927 --> 16:37.061
I'm still in the
formative stages

16:37.097 --> 16:38.529
so I don't really
have a name yet.

16:38.565 --> 16:41.799
I have some ideas, Roaming Rome.

16:42.736 --> 16:43.935
No.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.371
Or how about Ciao Christmas.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.674
Or my personal
favorite, Toga Tours.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.944
Nope, still working on the name.

16:52.979 --> 16:56.514
Well, Oliver, Christmas
drinks in the bar at 6:00?

16:56.549 --> 16:57.648
I will meet you in there

16:57.684 --> 16:59.217
just as soon as I'm checked in.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.451
Nice to meet you, Angela.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.486
- You as well.
- Take care.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.958
Um, excuse me, what are you
doing? Toga Tours?

17:07.027 --> 17:09.027
What I'm doing is helping
you with your new company.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.627
Yeah, but I didn't
ask for your help.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.096
But you still need it.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.397
You just need a little push.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.366
Look, Jack and Margaret Fletcher

17:15.402 --> 17:16.934
are serious private investors.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.469
If they like the
sound of your tour

17:18.538 --> 17:20.872
that might be the only
investment you need.

17:20.906 --> 17:23.241
Okay, but please, just
don't tell anyone else

17:23.276 --> 17:25.343
about possible
plans for a company

17:25.377 --> 17:28.179
that I will most definitely
not be calling Toga Tours.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.015
- Okay, okay, I promise.
- Great.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.651
Also, don't have too many of
those Christmas cocktails.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.486
Trust me, they're lethal here.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.922
And we are getting an early
start to the tour tomorrow.

17:37.991 --> 17:39.190
What's early?

17:39.225 --> 17:40.258
10 A.M.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.626
10 A.M.'s early?

17:41.661 --> 17:42.627
It is in Italy.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.066
[bell dings]

17:50.136 --> 17:54.472
[lively instrumental
"Deck the Hall

17:59.312 --> 18:00.878
So, this is all I could
find in your apartment.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.614
That's great, thanks Francesca.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.551
Just have to finish this
before my tour tomorrow.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.919
I thought Tomasso fired you.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.588
He did.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.890
I met an American, he's here
on business for a few days

18:12.926 --> 18:15.993
and he hired me to give him
a private Christmas tour.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.063
Why you didn't tell me?

18:19.099 --> 18:21.065
Eh, it's a long story.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.334
Oh, that's wonderful.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.369
You're one of the best
tour guides in this city.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.904
<i>Grazie.</i>

18:26.973 --> 18:28.239
[Francesca] So now
we can do the top.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.907
[Angela] All right.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.846
[upbeat Christmas music]

18:47.727 --> 18:49.093
Room with a view.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.629
[phone buzzing]

18:54.434 --> 18:57.135
- Hello.
- Oliver, it's Estelle.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.070
- [Oliver] <i> You're up early.</i>
- Actually working late.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.738
<i>How was your meeting
with Luigi?</i>

19:00.773 --> 19:02.940
Great, great. You'll be happy to
know he's invited me

19:02.976 --> 19:04.809
to tour his factory today.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.577
Did he accept our offer?

19:06.613 --> 19:09.313
Not yet. It's all part of how
they do business here.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.149
It's a bit of a dance, but,

19:11.217 --> 19:12.416
I'm finding my feet.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.851
Okay, just try to move quickly

19:13.887 --> 19:15.686
before any other
companies swoop in.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.321
Understood.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.422
[Estelle] <i> That's</i>
<i>what I like to hear.</i>

19:19.826 --> 19:22.293
Okay, first a few
tools of the trade.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.596
A tour guide has to be
prepared for all contingencies.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.831
What is that?

19:26.866 --> 19:28.132
It's a GPS tracking device.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.967
Is that really necessary?

19:30.036 --> 19:32.403
The worse thing a tour guide
can do is lose a client.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.672
Have you lost a client?

19:36.075 --> 19:38.976
Once, and it wasn't my fault.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.412
There were 15 Irish
rugby players, okay?

19:41.447 --> 19:43.214
They didn't listen
to a work I said.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.816
I'm the only person on the tour.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.953
Right.
And this way, I won't lose you.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.354
All right.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.589
[speaking Italian]

19:51.624 --> 19:54.392
Oh, will this tour
also be in English?

19:54.427 --> 19:55.726
Very funny.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.929
Welcome to Rome.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.364
[upbeat music]

20:03.069 --> 20:04.669
Just imagine being a gladiator,

20:04.737 --> 20:07.605
dropped into this
unfamiliar city,

20:07.674 --> 20:10.241
you're from a different country,
you don't speak the language,

20:10.276 --> 20:11.776
you're competitors
are out to get you.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.011
Hey, I can relate.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.582
I gotta admit, this is one
amazing feat of engineering.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.783
Can you believe that was created

20:18.851 --> 20:20.318
in less than 10 years?

20:20.353 --> 20:21.986
Now that's productivity.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.656
Just curious, do you
ever think about anything

20:25.692 --> 20:27.658
other than business?

20:27.694 --> 20:32.964
Hey, I am taking the time to
appreciate my surroundings.

20:32.999 --> 20:37.535
For instance, there is a
very nice Christmas tree.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.970
Yeah, that's the
thing about Rome,

20:39.005 --> 20:40.504
they know how to
celebrate Christmas.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.709
What is that?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.344
A guidebook I
bought at the hotel.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.879
It says there are 10 iconic
sights to see in Rome

20:48.915 --> 20:51.449
and I want to check
off all of them today.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.651
Oh, can I see that for a second?

20:53.720 --> 20:55.186
Yeah, sure.

20:55.221 --> 20:57.955
Oh, um-hmm, um-hmm,
very interesting, yeah.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.461
Why did you do that?

21:03.496 --> 21:06.030
That is checklist tourism.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.165
My tour shows you
the soul of Rome

21:08.201 --> 21:10.401
and the spirit of Christmas

21:10.436 --> 21:12.370
and that's what Luigi
wants you to understand.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.671
The soul of Rome?

21:13.706 --> 21:15.273
What does that even mean?

21:15.308 --> 21:17.008
The beauty, the art,
the history and romance,

21:17.076 --> 21:18.876
the culture.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.811
Sorry, jet lag.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.447
You were saying something about
the soul of Rome or something?

21:23.483 --> 21:24.849
Hey, wait up.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.453
How much farther?

21:29.489 --> 21:31.255
Almost there.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.690
How do you have so much energy?

21:32.725 --> 21:34.425
I give walking tours all day.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.793
It builds up stamina.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.762
Trust me, it will be worth it.

21:40.199 --> 21:41.799
That's spectacular.

21:44.937 --> 21:45.936
Wow.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.840
It's my favorite view of Rome.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.942
It's kind of my secret spot.

21:51.978 --> 21:55.212
It's not something you will
find on a regular tour.

21:55.248 --> 21:57.548
Kind of like a
local's only thing?

21:57.617 --> 21:59.417
Yeah, exactly.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.686
I'm sure you've heard that
Rome was built on seven hills,

22:01.721 --> 22:05.756
well, there's the
Palatine Hill, Pantheon,

22:07.493 --> 22:10.494
Janiculum, Palace of Justice.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.196
[Oliver] That's cool.

22:12.231 --> 22:16.267
And St. Peter's Basilica.

22:16.302 --> 22:19.070
Gotta admit,
this is a great view.

22:22.075 --> 22:26.877
Oh, now there is a Christmas
present that I could go for.

22:26.946 --> 22:30.047
That latte I had at the
hotel today had zero kick.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.850
Did you order a latte
or a caffè latte?

22:32.885 --> 22:35.553
I ordered a latte like
I do every single day
of my life.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.088
Yeah, but in New York.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.689
Excuse me?

22:38.725 --> 22:40.958
You're used to ordering
a latte in New York.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.427
In Italy, latte
means plain milk.

22:44.364 --> 22:45.696
Why didn't I know what?

22:45.765 --> 22:47.131
That's why you hired me.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.566
I know one of the
best coffee vendors

22:48.601 --> 22:50.334
and they set up right
around the corner.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.002
Now you're talking,
lead the way.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.871
Let's go, come on.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.340
[upbeat music]

23:00.613 --> 23:01.879
Let me get your coffee.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.114
Oh please, thank you.

23:04.650 --> 23:08.219
[speaking Italian]

23:09.422 --> 23:11.222
Why did you hold
up three fingers?

23:11.257 --> 23:13.190
I got us each an
espresso and one more.

23:13.226 --> 23:16.160
- For who?
- I dunno, that's part
of the fun.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.596
You lost me there.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.165
It's a Christmas tradition here.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.934
Caffè sospeso means
suspended coffee,

23:23.970 --> 23:25.970
buying coffee for someone
who can't afford it.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.472
So, later on the vendor
will offer someone

23:28.508 --> 23:30.374
a Christmas coffee as a gift.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.977
So, it's like pay it forward.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.011
Exactly.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.280
<i>Grazie.</i>

23:36.349 --> 23:37.415
<i>Prego.</i>

23:39.285 --> 23:42.553
Mmm, now that hits
the spot, wow.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.756
It's nice.

23:45.792 --> 23:49.326
It's not bad. It would be
perfect if I could bet better
cell service.

23:49.362 --> 23:51.328
Do you ever think about
anything except work?

23:51.364 --> 23:52.329
I'm working on it.

23:53.800 --> 23:54.765
Let's sit.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.405
You don't miss being
at home for Christmas?

24:01.474 --> 24:02.840
Not at all.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.042
Christmas is the best
time to get things done.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.677
Everybody else wants
to have time off,

24:06.712 --> 24:07.812
it gives me an edge.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.748
Oh, so you're a workaholic?

24:10.783 --> 24:12.416
It's in my blood, I guess.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.385
My father was running
a Fortune 500 company

24:14.454 --> 24:15.853
when he was my age.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.122
Wow, those are some
pretty big shoes to fill.

24:18.191 --> 24:19.890
Yeah, tell me about it.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.293
What about you?

24:22.328 --> 24:23.694
You like being a tour guide?

24:23.729 --> 24:25.963
Oh, I love being a tour guide.

24:27.333 --> 24:30.534
But, starting a company
up on my own is...

24:30.570 --> 24:32.503
It's intimidating.

24:32.538 --> 24:34.505
Don't worry about
it, you're a natural.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.173
Well, that's easier
for you to say.

24:36.209 --> 24:37.575
You're a business guy.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.046
- What do you need?
- Need for what?

24:42.081 --> 24:43.514
To make your tour company work,

24:43.549 --> 24:44.949
what do you need?

24:44.984 --> 24:46.450
Oh, well.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.052
First I need to get investors.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.688
And to do that, I need
to write a business plan

24:50.723 --> 24:53.524
which I have no idea how to do.

24:53.559 --> 24:56.227
- I can help you with that.
- Really?

24:56.295 --> 24:57.928
I work in acquisitions
and business development.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.264
I could write a business
plan in my sleep.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.899
And you would do that for me?

25:04.470 --> 25:08.372
If, you help me close
the deal with Luigi.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.475
Done.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.511
[laughing]

25:13.546 --> 25:18.549
Okay, so, what do you
think Luigi wants?

25:18.584 --> 25:20.184
What any other
business owner wants,

25:20.219 --> 25:22.753
to sell his company
for the highest number.

25:22.788 --> 25:24.421
I dunno.

25:24.457 --> 25:28.492
Luigi's family is very
old, very traditional

25:28.561 --> 25:30.261
and very rich.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.330
I don't think money is the
only motivating factor here.

25:33.366 --> 25:34.498
Okay, so what is?

25:34.567 --> 25:35.766
I think he wants to know

25:35.801 --> 25:37.201
that his company
is in good hands.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.003
Hmm.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.771
I think he wants to know
that whoever he
sells his company to

25:40.806 --> 25:43.173
is gonna value the things
that are important to him.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.151
- [bell ringing]
- [p[gentle music]ng]

25:56.722 --> 25:58.155
Hey Italian Santa.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.924
Actually they call
him <i> Babbo Natale.</i>

26:01.494 --> 26:02.993
You know, if you have
any Christmas gifts

26:03.029 --> 26:04.895
you need to buy for
anybody special back home

26:04.964 --> 26:05.930
this is the place.

26:08.534 --> 26:10.834
This is nice.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.304
Oh, yeah, that's antique
bronze from Verona.

26:15.007 --> 26:15.973
It's beautiful.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.475
Bel-isima.

26:18.511 --> 26:20.244
But, I don't really
need anything

26:20.279 --> 26:22.146
because I already sent my
folks on a Christmas cruise

26:22.181 --> 26:24.081
- to the Caribbean.
- Aw, that was nice.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.584
Don't have anyone
else to shop for?

26:27.587 --> 26:29.520
Naw, that's pretty much it.

26:29.555 --> 26:31.155
You know what?

26:31.223 --> 26:33.390
You could buy something
for Luigi's grandkids.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.025
It's customary to buy gifts

26:35.061 --> 26:36.327
when you're doing
business with someone new.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.695
That's a good idea.

26:38.531 --> 26:39.997
Yeah.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.466
[gentle music]

26:53.012 --> 26:55.913
My great-grandfather
moved the workshops here

26:55.948 --> 26:57.548
a century ago.

26:57.583 --> 27:01.218
Before that, we were
in a village in Sicily.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.553
And, ah...

27:04.090 --> 27:07.725
[speaking Italian]

27:09.862 --> 27:12.096
He's saying, "the old
kiln was actually built

27:12.131 --> 27:15.366
into the village's
medieval walls."

27:15.401 --> 27:18.235
It's certainly not like
any factory I've ever seen.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.871
All of our workers are artists,

27:20.906 --> 27:24.742
artists of clay, paint, glass.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.077
And we give them all
the time they need

27:27.113 --> 27:28.812
to make their wonders.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.948
Doesn't that limit their
production capacity?

27:33.019 --> 27:37.888
Perhaps, but art
cannot be rushed.

27:37.923 --> 27:41.125
And everything is
just beautiful.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.927
Come, I show you my
favorite room of all.

27:51.504 --> 27:55.739
These are the finest Christmas
ornaments in the world.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.308
My grandfather used to make them

27:58.344 --> 28:00.344
for the family Christmas.

28:00.413 --> 28:03.847
Then my mother carried
on the tradition,

28:04.850 --> 28:06.650
then me and my children too.

28:08.921 --> 28:13.490
This is where a delicate
hand brings to life...

28:13.559 --> 28:14.758
[speaking Italian]

28:14.794 --> 28:15.993
"The joys of Christmas."

28:16.028 --> 28:18.195
Yes, the joys of Christmas.

28:18.264 --> 28:21.799
I don't imagine these
command the same margin

28:21.834 --> 28:24.301
as kitchen ceramics
in your store

28:24.336 --> 28:26.403
given how long they
must take to create.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.373
Yes, a lot of time.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.042
Each one hand painted.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.517
But the result,
it speaks for itself.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.190
Bell-issimo.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.191
Beautiful.

28:49.762 --> 28:52.563
So, have you been enjoying
your time in Rome?

28:52.631 --> 28:54.965
Yes, yes, actually
Angela's been giving me

28:55.000 --> 28:56.400
a tour of the city.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.103
- It's beautiful huh?
- Amazing.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.605
We climbed up to some secret
local's only view point

29:01.640 --> 29:04.308
so we could see the
seven hills of Rome.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.309
All seven?

29:06.579 --> 29:08.245
And which one did you like best?

29:09.381 --> 29:11.949
I liked looking at <i> Gian-jello.</i>

29:13.319 --> 29:14.518
[laughing]

29:14.553 --> 29:16.520
You mean Janiculum.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.155
Well, actually
Janiculum doesn't belong

29:18.190 --> 29:20.357
to the seven hills of Rome,
but it's beautiful.

29:21.861 --> 29:25.262
And how it make you feel?

29:25.297 --> 29:28.932
Exhausted, when we bought
that caffè sospeso,

29:28.968 --> 29:30.634
I was the one that
needed it the most.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.369
You know caffè sospeso?

29:32.404 --> 29:34.304
Sure, the Christmas tradition

29:34.340 --> 29:36.240
of buying someone else's coffee.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.476
That's one of my
favorite traditions.

29:39.512 --> 29:43.747
Which reminds me, some gifts
for your grandchildren.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.916
Angela took me to this
great Christmas market.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.653
Thank you, very kind.

29:49.688 --> 29:53.824
Tomorrow is December 22nd, you
must both join me for dinner

29:53.859 --> 29:55.692
at my family villa.

29:55.728 --> 29:58.562
And there, perhaps, we
can talk business too.

29:58.631 --> 29:59.997
That would be great.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.399
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.803
[upbeat music]

30:11.010 --> 30:13.777
And this is
St. Peter's Basilica,

30:13.813 --> 30:15.712
the burial place of St. Peter.

30:15.748 --> 30:17.481
Impressive.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.850
You know, I should really be
getting back to the hotel.

30:19.885 --> 30:21.084
You want to impress Luigi,

30:21.153 --> 30:22.186
you have to do your homework.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.056
St. Peter's is regarded

30:26.091 --> 30:28.192
as one of the holiest
Catholic shrines.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.993
Now here you can see...

30:30.930 --> 30:31.895
Angela?

30:33.699 --> 30:35.632
Tomasso, hi.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.134
What are you doing here?

30:37.203 --> 30:39.002
You have a big group today.

30:39.038 --> 30:43.240
Oh, yeah, business is good
and you have a tour of one?

30:45.344 --> 30:47.211
Oliver Martin.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.779
Tomasso Toffino.

30:48.814 --> 30:51.849
If you want a real
American style tour,

30:51.884 --> 30:53.183
please call me.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.586
Real American style tour,
what's that?

30:55.621 --> 30:58.455
Well, we cover Rome's
top 10 tourist sites

30:58.490 --> 30:59.423
in a single day.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.892
All 10, that's quick.

31:01.927 --> 31:03.427
Well, we keep to a schedule.

31:03.495 --> 31:06.129
I like that, but I signed
up with Angela's company

31:06.165 --> 31:08.866
because I was looking
for something a

31:11.170 --> 31:12.502
Angela's company?

31:12.571 --> 31:14.071
Oh yeah, didn't she tell you?

31:14.106 --> 31:17.374
It's a boutique
personalized travel service.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.109
No, I didn't know

31:19.144 --> 31:21.178
that you had started
your own company, Angela.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.447
Oh yeah, she's fantastic.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.682
She's gonna be handling
all of our corporate tours

31:25.718 --> 31:26.717
here next year.

31:26.752 --> 31:28.018
Yeah.

31:28.053 --> 31:32.189
Oh, that's, well
that's great news.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.557
Congratulations.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.692
Oh, thank you so much, Tomasso.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.294
You know we should
probably move on.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.897
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you,

31:39.965 --> 31:41.465
and have fun, thank you.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.502
[Oliver] That guy back
there a friend of yours?

31:45.537 --> 31:47.604
My ex-boss.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.606
He actually fired me.

31:49.642 --> 31:53.110
Wait, boutique personalized
travel service.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.712
- I'm sorry.
- No don't be, I liked it.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.180
Thank you for making
me sound good.

31:57.216 --> 31:58.782
I figured I owed you

31:58.817 --> 32:02.452
for saving my bacon
yesterday with Luigi.

32:02.521 --> 32:03.987
You know what,
it's three o'clock,

32:04.023 --> 32:06.757
so I think that concludes
our tour for the day.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.592
Do you want me to walk
you back to your hotel?

32:08.661 --> 32:11.795
I was hoping we could
find somewhere to eat.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.264
I dunno, that's gonna
put me into overtime.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.832
I don't want to eat with
you as my tour guide.

32:15.868 --> 32:17.734
I just want us to eat together.

32:19.905 --> 32:22.205
Are you asking me out on a date?

32:22.241 --> 32:25.309
No, no, no, not a "date" date.

32:25.377 --> 32:28.445
Good, because I'm not
allowed to date my clients.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.280
Hang on, aren't you
starting your own company?

32:30.316 --> 32:32.015
Doesn't that mean you
get to make the rules?

32:32.051 --> 32:33.317
And those are my rules.

32:33.352 --> 32:34.451
Got it.

32:36.021 --> 32:39.690
For the record, I was not
asking you out on date.

32:39.725 --> 32:43.360
- Good to know.
- 'Cause that would be awkward.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.828
No, and that's why
there are rules,

32:44.863 --> 32:46.129
you know, so.

32:47.866 --> 32:50.233
But, we both still
need to eat, right?

32:50.269 --> 32:54.004
So, why don't we eat together?

32:54.073 --> 32:55.639
I really shouldn't.

32:55.708 --> 32:57.240
I'm actually gonna go
get a Christmas tree

32:57.309 --> 32:58.475
for my apartment.

32:58.510 --> 32:59.509
Really?

32:59.578 --> 33:01.211
Oh, I happen to be

33:01.246 --> 33:02.713
an expert in the
Christmas tree department.

33:02.748 --> 33:03.981
You are not.

33:04.016 --> 33:05.515
Oh try me.

33:05.584 --> 33:09.219
We will get you the
best tree on that lot.

33:09.254 --> 33:11.855
You got your Douglas
Fir, your Frazier Fir,

33:11.924 --> 33:13.890
your Grand Fir, and
my personal favorite,

33:13.926 --> 33:16.960
the Noble Fir, known for its
strong branches and smell.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.462
Here, it's the Austrian Pine.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.963
When I'm looking for
a Christmas tree,

33:20.032 --> 33:21.498
I like to go for height.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.200
Really?

33:23.268 --> 33:25.369
Nah, there's so many
other things to consider.

33:25.404 --> 33:29.306
Okay, well, this one
has a good height,

33:29.341 --> 33:31.141
a nice color and scent.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.977
It's kind of sappy.

33:34.013 --> 33:37.848
This one, it just
looks great, right?

33:39.084 --> 33:40.183
It's perfecto.

33:40.219 --> 33:42.886
Ah, how do you say please?

33:42.921 --> 33:45.422
- [Angela] <i> Per favore.</i>
<i>- Per favore.</i>

33:45.491 --> 33:46.523
Please.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.163
I think it's gonna look
really good over here.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.231
Just right over here.

33:55.934 --> 33:57.334
Here, I'll go look.

33:58.604 --> 33:59.569
Let me look.

34:02.775 --> 34:05.342
Perfecto, perfect.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.411
<i>Zia</i> Angela,<i> Zia</i> Angela.

34:07.446 --> 34:10.179
Hi.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.181
Have you made
gingerbread houses?

34:12.251 --> 34:14.117
Oh, I love gingerbread houses.

34:14.186 --> 34:15.518
Z-Angela?

34:15.554 --> 34:17.254
<i>Zia</i> means auntie.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.755
This is Monica,
she lives downstairs.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.891
She is my favorite neighbor.

34:20.926 --> 34:22.926
- Hello, I'm Oliver.
<i>- Buon Natale.</i>

34:22.960 --> 34:24.561
<i>Buon Natale.</i>

34:24.596 --> 34:25.862
Ciao!

34:25.898 --> 34:29.099
Ciao, Angela.

34:29.134 --> 34:30.900
Ciao, Francesca Gianelli.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.002
Oliver Martin.

34:32.036 --> 34:33.637
Oh, you bought a tree.

34:33.672 --> 34:34.838
And I'm Pietro.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.339
Merry Christmas, Oliver.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.607
- Merry Christmas.
- Do you need a hand?

34:37.643 --> 34:39.876
Yes, please.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.344
You have known
Angela a long time?

34:42.380 --> 34:43.713
Actually we just met.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.148
I'm in town this
week for business,

34:45.184 --> 34:46.850
hoping to acquire
a ceramics company.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.217
Forlinghetti.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.053
Wow, Forlinghetti?

34:50.089 --> 34:51.088
Beautiful.

34:51.156 --> 34:52.289
I think so.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.157
Now, come.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.859
Monica needs help building
ginger bread houses, right?

34:56.728 --> 34:57.894
Let's go, come on.

35:02.201 --> 35:06.436
["The First Noel"
piano instrumental]

35:23.355 --> 35:26.857
Here is some hot
chocolate for you guys.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.291
Gra-sie.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.392
Prego.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.261
It's grazie.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.295
Grazie.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.234
Hey, I just a great idea.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.669
Why don't we switch?

35:39.738 --> 35:41.571
[laughing]

35:41.607 --> 35:42.572
No?

35:44.309 --> 35:47.043
He's very funny. Oliver.

35:47.079 --> 35:49.146
That's definitely one
word to describe him.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.847
And good looking too, huh?

35:50.883 --> 35:52.916
I hadn't noticed.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.084
Of course not.

35:57.122 --> 35:59.356
I have more building material.

36:00.225 --> 36:01.491
Just in time, thank you.

36:05.197 --> 36:08.798
Oh, wow, that is, um,

36:08.834 --> 36:11.401
certainly different than
any gingerbread house

36:11.436 --> 36:13.136
I've ever seen before.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.971
That is because it's
not a gingerbread house,

36:15.007 --> 36:17.574
it is a gingerbread Colosseum.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.309
Oh, very artistic.

36:19.344 --> 36:23.680
Yeah, see this is
the outer wall.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.716
Nice, oh.

36:29.254 --> 36:30.554
And it's the fall of Rome.

36:32.457 --> 36:34.090
I think you're gonna
need more icing.

36:34.126 --> 36:35.792
- Yes.
- I'll get it.

36:37.229 --> 36:39.629
[bright music]

36:45.938 --> 36:48.605
I mean, I was really
impressed with your Colosseum.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.273
I know.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.108
You didn't have to walk
me all the way back.

36:52.144 --> 36:54.244
No, I actually think I did.

36:54.279 --> 36:56.112
Can't lose anyone on
the tour, remember?

36:57.249 --> 36:58.748
I had a great time.

36:58.784 --> 37:01.017
And I can honestly say
I've never been on a tour

37:01.053 --> 37:02.519
anything like yours.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.921
I think you have a
real opportunity here.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.756
Thank you.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.525
Now if you could just find a
way to scale your business,

37:08.560 --> 37:09.926
hire more tour guides

37:09.962 --> 37:11.628
so you can work as
CEO and brain trust,

37:11.697 --> 37:14.197
then you got something that
investors can really get behind.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.099
This is exactly what
I've been thinking.

37:16.134 --> 37:18.535
I'm happy to help anyway I can.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.471
Um, that's really sweet.

37:21.506 --> 37:22.572
I have my moments.

37:22.608 --> 37:25.075
And I appreciate it.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.680
Um, I think we should
focus on tomorrow though.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.315
Okay.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.150
So, we're going to
Luigi's villa for dinner.

37:34.219 --> 37:39.089
And, I think we need to
do Rome like the Romans.

37:40.158 --> 37:42.859
Do Rome like the Romans.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.461
What does that mean?

37:44.496 --> 37:46.062
In Italy, when someone
invites you to dinner

37:46.098 --> 37:47.464
you bring a gift.

37:47.532 --> 37:49.466
So, I need to buy
something for Luigi.

37:49.501 --> 37:52.636
Not buy, bake.

37:52.704 --> 37:53.637
Bake?

37:53.672 --> 37:55.138
I don't bake.

37:55.173 --> 37:57.007
Well, you will tomorrow.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.577
Have a good night.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.645
Good night.

38:05.884 --> 38:08.218
[gentle music]

38:13.692 --> 38:14.691
Bake.

38:19.164 --> 38:21.665
[phone beeping]

38:23.035 --> 38:25.669
[gentle music]

38:56.001 --> 38:57.934
Good morning.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.570
Ah, buongiorno.

39:00.605 --> 39:03.006
Thank you so much for emailing
the business plan template.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.240
You didn't have to do that.

39:04.276 --> 39:06.076
Oh yes, I did.
A deal's a deal.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.278
Plus, I wanted to.

39:08.313 --> 39:09.412
Thank you.

39:09.448 --> 39:10.714
Did you get it finished?

39:10.749 --> 39:12.349
Ah, no.
I just got started, but,

39:13.251 --> 39:14.684
I do have a name.

39:14.753 --> 39:15.885
Let's hear it.

39:15.921 --> 39:18.054
When in Roma.

39:18.090 --> 39:20.990
When in Roma, do
as the Romans do.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.292
Exactly.

39:22.327 --> 39:23.893
Catchy, simple,
clear, I love it.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.562
Thank you.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.597
All right, are you read
to see Rome like Roman?

39:27.632 --> 39:28.698
Ready as I'll ever be.

39:28.734 --> 39:29.699
Wait, no, no, hold on.

39:31.803 --> 39:34.871
- Put this on.
- I, ah, can't ride a motorbike.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.573
It's not a motorbike,
it's a Vespa.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.174
Don't worry,
I'll do the driving.

39:39.444 --> 39:40.710
[upbeat music]

39:40.746 --> 39:43.313
[horn honking]

39:43.348 --> 39:45.982
[upbeat music]

39:54.159 --> 39:55.525
You okay?

39:55.560 --> 39:57.594
I think I nearly
died about 50 times.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.729
Nobody pays any attention
to the road signs.

39:59.765 --> 40:00.730
No.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.632
And nobody signals.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.768
No never. Signaling in Rome is
seen as a sign of weakness.

40:04.803 --> 40:06.569
Amazing anyone survives.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.171
And yet, we do.

40:08.206 --> 40:11.074
All right, I'm gonna need
you to close your eyes.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.475
I don't really like the--

40:12.511 --> 40:14.043
No, come on, just trust me.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.379
Rome isn't just a
city of old buildings.

40:16.415 --> 40:18.715
It's a city of sensations,

40:18.750 --> 40:20.650
especially at Christmas.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.752
All right, this way.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.324
Now you're gonna take
a step up, step up.

40:28.393 --> 40:29.459
Ha!

40:30.996 --> 40:32.462
- You okay?
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

40:32.497 --> 40:34.330
All right, where do
you think we are?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.166
Without looking?

40:36.201 --> 40:37.734
Yeah, that's the point.

40:37.803 --> 40:39.669
Take a deep breath,
breathe in that scent.

40:41.406 --> 40:42.539
A cupcake factory.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.209
Angela!

40:46.244 --> 40:48.344
[speaking Italian]

40:50.515 --> 40:51.681
Okay, keep your eyes closed

40:51.750 --> 40:52.649
but open your mouth.

40:52.717 --> 40:53.716
Ahh.

40:55.821 --> 40:56.753
What do you think?

40:56.788 --> 40:57.754
Delicious.

40:57.789 --> 40:58.855
Really?

40:58.890 --> 40:59.889
Mm, what is it?

40:59.925 --> 41:00.857
Mm, ciao.

41:00.892 --> 41:01.825
Ciao.

41:01.860 --> 41:02.926
It's panettone.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.462
Luca makes the best in the city.

41:05.530 --> 41:07.197
It's a sweet bread
load with dried fruit.

41:07.232 --> 41:10.133
It's one of my favorite
Italian Christmas traditions.

41:10.168 --> 41:12.535
So, it's pretty much
just Christmas fruitcake,

41:12.571 --> 41:14.637
- Italian style?
- Yeah, pretty much.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.206
It's amazing.

41:16.241 --> 41:17.740
Come, I have it all
set up for you, okay?

41:19.144 --> 41:20.043
Follow me.

41:20.111 --> 41:22.479
[bright music]

41:25.083 --> 41:26.516
Come, come this way, guys.

41:26.551 --> 41:29.185
I prepared all the
ingredients you need.

41:29.221 --> 41:31.087
Ingredients for what?

41:31.122 --> 41:32.121
For panettone.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.258
I can't even boil an egg,

41:35.293 --> 41:37.961
let alone bake Christmas bread.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.330
That's why you're
here, to learn.

41:40.398 --> 41:41.564
Enjoy.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.699
[speaking Italian]

41:42.734 --> 41:43.700
Ciao.

41:45.670 --> 41:46.703
Okay.

41:48.907 --> 41:52.141
Panettone is the king
of Christmas breads.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.544
An
The stale store-bought kind

41:54.579 --> 41:56.112
that you find in America.

41:56.147 --> 41:59.315
Real panettone,
it's rich and buttery.

41:59.384 --> 42:01.818
Okay, it sounds good so far.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.653
So, now the dough
is easy to make.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.154
Just watch me and follow along.

42:05.223 --> 42:06.189
Take the oil.

42:09.261 --> 42:10.226
And then the salt.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.633
And then we'll add the flour.

42:18.703 --> 42:21.337
Slowly, add the flour.

42:27.445 --> 42:30.547
You know what, your
method works too.

42:30.582 --> 42:32.181
All right, now for the fun part.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.182
- Dig in.
- All right.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.852
Yes.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.020
Perfect.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.721
Hey, it's working.

42:38.790 --> 42:40.657
All right, now we're just
gonna throw a little flour

42:40.725 --> 42:42.559
on our boards and then
you're gonna take the dough

42:42.594 --> 42:44.160
and you're gonna knead it

42:44.195 --> 42:47.096
until it becomes
smooth and elastic.

42:49.334 --> 42:52.602
So, how come you're in Rome?

42:52.637 --> 42:53.736
I mean, don't get me wrong,

42:53.772 --> 42:54.871
Rome is amazing,

42:54.906 --> 42:58.708
but why not Paris or London?

43:00.078 --> 43:01.711
Ah, my parents are
both from Seattle,

43:01.746 --> 43:04.080
but they met here,

43:04.115 --> 43:06.716
a semester aboard in college.

43:06.751 --> 43:09.986
And then they brought me
here one summer when I was 10

43:10.021 --> 43:12.121
and I just, ah!

43:12.190 --> 43:13.823
I just thought Rome
was so magical.

43:15.427 --> 43:18.027
Your folks still
live in Seattle?

43:18.063 --> 43:21.497
Ah, no, they both
passed away a while ago.

43:21.533 --> 43:22.498
I am so sorry.

43:23.301 --> 43:24.334
Thanks.

43:25.303 --> 43:26.669
Is that why you left?

43:26.705 --> 43:28.171
No, I loved Seattle.

43:28.239 --> 43:30.373
I loved it, I had my
whole life planned there.

43:33.144 --> 43:34.477
Fine, I'll tell you the story.

43:34.546 --> 43:36.713
Ah, five years
ago I was planning

43:36.748 --> 43:38.014
the perfect Christmas wedding.

43:38.049 --> 43:40.283
I mean everything was perfect,

43:40.318 --> 43:43.720
perfect venue, perfect
food, perfect church,

43:43.755 --> 43:45.254
and all just perfect

43:45.290 --> 43:49.392
until my perfect fiancé, Brian,

43:49.427 --> 43:51.427
well, he got
perfectly cold feet.

43:52.564 --> 43:54.097
He left you at the altar?

43:54.132 --> 43:57.834
A week before, but yeah.
Threw me for a loop.

43:57.902 --> 43:59.769
I imagine it did.

43:59.804 --> 44:02.538
So, I just packed up
everything I owned
and I left.

44:04.342 --> 44:06.676
I fell in love with this place,

44:06.711 --> 44:09.612
its beauty, and you
know, the history.

44:09.648 --> 44:12.048
So, I got a great job
at a tour company,

44:12.083 --> 44:14.951
a job which I have
not lost, as you know.

44:15.820 --> 44:17.587
Angela, I truly believe

44:17.622 --> 44:20.456
that you can do whatever
you set your mind to.

44:21.693 --> 44:23.092
Starting your own tour company

44:23.128 --> 44:25.695
should be a piece of cake.

44:25.730 --> 44:27.330
- Pun intended.
- [laughing]

44:27.365 --> 44:28.865
Thank you.

44:28.900 --> 44:30.933
I on the other hand
have created a boulder,

44:31.002 --> 44:33.803
a rock type dough scenario.

44:33.838 --> 44:35.371
You have, yes.

44:35.407 --> 44:37.173
I do not have what it
takes to figure this out.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.708
Let me help you.

44:38.777 --> 44:41.144
All right, you have to knead it.

44:41.212 --> 44:43.579
You can't be afraid to
really push it around.

44:52.223 --> 44:53.923
Yeah, look.

44:53.958 --> 44:55.992
It's working.

44:56.027 --> 44:57.660
Perfect.

44:57.696 --> 44:59.228
All right, now we're
gonna add the dried fruit,

44:59.264 --> 45:00.863
the raisins and the nuts.

45:01.666 --> 45:02.699
[phone buzzing]

45:02.767 --> 45:04.267
Oh, um...

45:07.038 --> 45:08.371
It's my boss.

45:08.440 --> 45:10.173
- Do you mind?
- Oh no, of course.

45:10.241 --> 45:13.142
This has to rest before we
put it in the oven anyway.

45:13.178 --> 45:16.079
Hey, Estelle, I got
your email last night.

45:16.114 --> 45:17.580
I was just gonna call you back.

45:17.615 --> 45:19.816
I wanted to make sure
things were moving ahead.

45:19.851 --> 45:22.118
<i>Things are moving a bit
slower than I expected</i>

45:22.153 --> 45:25.822
but Luigi did invite me to
his family's villa tonight

45:25.857 --> 45:28.491
and in Italy, that's a big step.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.059
Well, that's good news,

45:30.095 --> 45:31.794
but it could also be
a stalling tactic.

45:31.830 --> 45:34.063
<i>I don't think
anybody's stalling.</i>

45:34.099 --> 45:35.865
Where are you?

45:35.900 --> 45:37.567
I am in a bakery.

45:37.635 --> 45:39.202
<i>And what's that got to do</i>

45:39.270 --> 45:40.470
<i>with winning the
Forlinghetti deal?</i>

45:42.340 --> 45:44.540
Estelle, I'm in Italy.

45:44.609 --> 45:46.809
They got a different way of
doing business around here.

45:46.878 --> 45:48.377
[Estelle] <i> Now you're</i>
<i>making me nervous.</i>

45:48.413 --> 45:49.846
When was the last time

45:49.881 --> 45:51.481
I let a big deal like
this get away, hmm?

45:51.516 --> 45:53.149
I got everything under control.

45:55.720 --> 45:57.120
Now, the last thing
I want to show you

45:57.155 --> 46:00.022
is the world famous
Trevi Fountain.

46:01.192 --> 46:02.158
Spectacular, wow.

46:07.065 --> 46:10.466
[speaking Italian]

46:10.502 --> 46:12.268
This is incredible.

46:16.574 --> 46:18.741
[people laughing]

46:18.810 --> 46:20.943
What are they doing,
making Christmas wishes?

46:22.280 --> 46:25.014
Aw, no, it's an old tradition.

46:25.049 --> 46:26.949
They say if you throw
coins with your right hand

46:26.985 --> 46:28.551
over your left shoulder
into the fountain,

46:28.586 --> 46:31.387
a return to Rome is guaranteed.

46:31.422 --> 46:32.522
Okay, here we go.

46:33.591 --> 46:34.924
Oh, wait, wait.

46:36.928 --> 46:38.294
Too late, what did I do?

46:39.731 --> 46:41.130
How many coins did you throw in?

46:41.199 --> 46:42.765
Three I think, why?

46:42.834 --> 46:44.767
- Oh, oh no.
- What's wrong?

46:44.803 --> 46:46.302
Oh no.

46:46.337 --> 46:49.172
Well, one coin gets
you a return to Rome.

46:49.207 --> 46:52.642
Two coins brings you
an Italian romance.

46:52.710 --> 46:54.977
But three coins, well,

46:55.013 --> 46:58.014
three coins brings
you true love.

46:58.049 --> 47:00.349
Well, don't worry, I don't
believe in fairy tales so...

47:02.053 --> 47:04.053
Me neither.

47:04.088 --> 47:06.022
But my parents threw
three coins in,

47:06.057 --> 47:08.658
and well, it worked
its magic for them.

47:10.628 --> 47:13.029
[gentle music]

47:15.800 --> 47:17.266
It's a beautiful picture.

47:17.302 --> 47:19.468
That was Christmas Eve
almost 40 years ago.

47:19.504 --> 47:20.670
The day before they got married.

47:24.442 --> 47:25.408
Thanks.

47:28.913 --> 47:30.213
We should probably get going,

47:30.248 --> 47:31.247
get ready for tonight.

47:31.316 --> 47:32.315
Okay.

47:36.688 --> 47:39.355
[gentle music]

47:41.759 --> 47:43.926
[speaking Italian]

47:54.105 --> 47:55.738
What a beautiful dress.

47:57.342 --> 47:58.641
Grazie.

47:59.677 --> 48:02.578
You look incredible.

48:02.614 --> 48:05.014
I figured since we're going to
dinner at Luigi's home

48:05.049 --> 48:06.983
and this is your
big business deal,

48:07.051 --> 48:10.086
I should put in a
little bit of effort.

48:10.154 --> 48:11.120
I appreciate it.

48:13.591 --> 48:15.725
We should go,
the taxi's waiting.

48:15.760 --> 48:16.826
Right.

48:17.662 --> 48:20.263
[gentle music]

48:27.805 --> 48:30.740
[people chattering]

48:34.545 --> 48:36.078
Thank you.

48:36.114 --> 48:40.082
I cannot believe you
made us panettone, Oliver.

48:40.151 --> 48:41.484
Two panettone.

48:41.519 --> 48:43.219
<i>Due.</i>

48:43.254 --> 48:45.421
And for you, we
break the tradition.

48:45.490 --> 48:46.689
We eat it before dinner.

48:48.626 --> 48:50.059
Thank you.

48:50.094 --> 48:51.594
Angela took me to
this beautiful bakery.

48:51.663 --> 48:53.029
It's Il Forno.

48:53.064 --> 48:55.231
Oh, Il Forno,
I know it, very good.

48:55.266 --> 48:56.766
Yes, we made them together.

48:56.834 --> 48:58.668
From scratch?

48:58.703 --> 49:00.670
I just followed Angela's lead
and did what she told me.

49:01.906 --> 49:03.739
It's a beautiful
gesture, grazie.

49:04.709 --> 49:06.442
Prego.

49:06.477 --> 49:08.544
And now he speaks Italian.

49:08.579 --> 49:10.179
You'll be fluent in no time.

49:11.482 --> 49:13.883
[motor humming]

49:15.520 --> 49:17.420
[Sofia] This is
one of my favorite.

49:17.455 --> 49:20.022
It's incredible,
they're all so unique.

49:22.193 --> 49:23.993
These ornaments are just...

49:24.028 --> 49:25.728
They're beautiful.

49:25.763 --> 49:27.663
Some of these ornaments
were made by Luigi's parents

49:27.699 --> 49:30.066
or grandparents,
and by our children.

49:32.403 --> 49:34.236
So, when we look at the tree,

49:34.305 --> 49:38.708
it's not just beautiful, each
ornament is a moment in time.

49:40.244 --> 49:43.813
Oh, that is a lot of
special Christmas moments.

49:43.881 --> 49:45.881
Exacta-mente.

49:45.917 --> 49:48.617
Oh, excuse, I must
check on dinner.

49:48.653 --> 49:49.652
Oh, of course.

49:54.359 --> 49:55.691
It's incredible.

50:00.765 --> 50:02.498
It's a Christmas treasure.

50:02.533 --> 50:04.834
Gives new meaning
to family tree.

50:09.507 --> 50:12.608
[Angela] So, how it's
going with Luigi?

50:12.643 --> 50:13.943
I'm not gonna rush him.

50:15.013 --> 50:18.914
We'll see.
What?

50:18.950 --> 50:21.350
Look at you, you're
learning to slow down,

50:21.386 --> 50:22.885
live life like an Italian.

50:24.022 --> 50:25.121
Maybe I am.

50:26.424 --> 50:27.890
I gotta admit it,

50:27.959 --> 50:30.426
this trip is not quite
what I expected it to be.

50:31.529 --> 50:32.495
In a good way, I hope.

50:33.631 --> 50:35.297
Better than good.

50:47.111 --> 50:48.711
What's that for?

50:48.746 --> 50:50.746
[chuckles] To help me
remember this perfect night.

50:54.185 --> 50:56.085
Send me a copy.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.086
Of course.

51:00.625 --> 51:05.127
Angela, Oliver, come,
exactly five minutes.

51:06.064 --> 51:07.296
We'll be right in, Sofia.

51:14.872 --> 51:17.506
The panettone was
such a great idea.

51:17.542 --> 51:19.942
Just one more thing that
makes Angela's tours unique.

51:20.011 --> 51:23.312
Her tours do sound amazing.

51:23.347 --> 51:25.614
She's actually looking
to expand her company,

51:25.650 --> 51:27.083
hire some more guides.

51:27.151 --> 51:29.018
Good for you.

51:29.053 --> 51:30.786
Thank you, I'm still in the
beginning stages of planning.

51:30.822 --> 51:32.021
I've taken a look at
her business plan,

51:32.056 --> 51:34.023
pretty impressive.

51:34.058 --> 51:37.293
Well, Oliver's always had
a good nose for business.

51:37.328 --> 51:39.995
So if he says it's
good, it must be.

51:40.031 --> 51:41.430
Maybe we could have a look.

51:42.767 --> 51:45.668
We do like to invest
in small businesses.

51:45.703 --> 51:47.837
Great, I could bring
the business plan

51:47.905 --> 51:49.538
by your hotel
tomorrow if you like.

51:50.842 --> 51:51.907
Perfect.

51:54.412 --> 51:57.079
Well, I think we
should have a toast.

51:58.883 --> 52:00.716
I've only been in
Rome for a couple days

52:00.751 --> 52:03.953
but Luigi and Sofia, you
have made me feel so welcome

52:03.988 --> 52:07.289
and I just want to thank
you for your generosity

52:07.325 --> 52:08.724
and your hospitality.

52:08.759 --> 52:11.093
So, to one and all,
Merry Christmas.

52:11.129 --> 52:12.328
[everyone] Merry Christmas.

52:12.396 --> 52:16.298
[speaking Italian]

52:24.575 --> 52:27.743
[car motor rumbling]

52:27.812 --> 52:31.647
[Jack] And here we are
at home away from home.

52:31.682 --> 52:34.450
It was such a treat, spending
the evening with you.

52:34.485 --> 52:35.818
Likewise.

52:35.853 --> 52:37.253
What a meal!

52:37.288 --> 52:39.021
Luigi needs to go into
the restaurant business.

52:39.056 --> 52:40.623
[laughing]

52:40.658 --> 52:42.491
I think I'm gonna
walk Angela home.

52:42.560 --> 52:43.759
Good night.

52:43.794 --> 52:44.760
Good night, Jack.

52:48.966 --> 52:50.533
I can't believe you told them

52:50.568 --> 52:52.635
I was looking for investors
to grow my company.

52:52.670 --> 52:54.937
Think of it as an
early Christmas gift.

52:56.107 --> 52:57.139
Thank you.

52:58.976 --> 53:01.610
You wanna go get
some hot chocolate?

53:01.646 --> 53:03.879
I'd love to,
but I feel like I should go home

53:03.915 --> 53:06.115
and work on my
new business plan.

53:06.150 --> 53:07.783
I could help you.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.218
I think I've got it covered.

53:09.253 --> 53:10.553
Because with
investors like this,

53:10.621 --> 53:12.154
you only get one shot.

53:12.190 --> 53:13.556
You really gotta make
sure you're ready.

53:13.591 --> 53:14.690
Oh, I've already
been working on it,

53:14.725 --> 53:15.958
I just need to polish it up.

53:18.229 --> 53:19.962
Okay.

53:20.031 --> 53:21.063
Can I still walk you home?

53:22.500 --> 53:24.166
I'd love that.

53:24.235 --> 53:26.669
[gentle music]

53:45.056 --> 53:47.923
[keyboard clicking]

53:56.000 --> 53:58.634
[phone jingling]

54:00.805 --> 54:02.037
Oliver, hi.

54:02.073 --> 54:03.339
How's the business plan going?

54:03.374 --> 54:05.140
It's getting there.

54:05.176 --> 54:06.976
I just emailed you a couple
of photos from last night.

54:07.011 --> 54:08.210
You might want to use those too.

54:08.246 --> 54:09.278
Okay.

54:12.450 --> 54:17.386
Oh, here it is.
Oh, these are great.

54:17.421 --> 54:20.155
So, I'm gonna be busy the
rest of the day with Luigi.

54:20.191 --> 54:21.657
Oh, right, good luck.

54:21.692 --> 54:22.958
And you've got some
pitching to do,

54:22.994 --> 54:24.693
so good luck to us both.

54:24.729 --> 54:29.765
I was thinking maybe you should
take the next 24 hours off.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.567
Oh, okay.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.369
Is something wrong?

54:33.404 --> 54:36.305
No, no, I'm just trying
to work around a problem.

54:36.374 --> 54:38.173
What kind of problem?

54:38.209 --> 54:40.476
You have a rule against
dating clients, right?

54:44.982 --> 54:46.415
Yes.

54:46.450 --> 54:49.752
So, in theory, if I
wasn't your client,

54:49.787 --> 54:52.488
you could go to dinner
with me tonight?

54:55.226 --> 54:57.993
In theory, um-hmm.

54:58.029 --> 55:00.229
Excellent.

55:00.264 --> 55:02.431
Would you like to go to
dinner with me tonight?

55:04.001 --> 55:05.768
I would love that.

55:05.803 --> 55:07.369
Great.

55:07.405 --> 55:09.371
I will make a reservation
and pick you up a 7:00.

55:09.407 --> 55:10.639
That sounds great.

55:10.675 --> 55:12.608
Wait, no, I'm the tour guide.

55:12.643 --> 55:14.243
I should be making
the itinerary.

55:14.312 --> 55:15.978
Not tonight.
My cab's here, I gotta go.

55:16.013 --> 55:17.413
Good luck.

55:17.448 --> 55:18.947
Okay, good luck,
I'll see you later.

55:26.157 --> 55:29.258
[bright, happy music]

55:52.616 --> 55:55.417
Luigi, thank you for
letting me use this studio,

55:55.453 --> 55:56.819
I really appreciate it.

55:57.822 --> 56:00.155
It's a pleasure to help.

56:00.224 --> 56:02.257
I understand that
you want to make

56:02.326 --> 56:04.626
a very special Christmas gift?

56:04.662 --> 56:06.862
Angela was so helpful
to me this week.

56:06.897 --> 56:08.430
I noticed.

56:08.466 --> 56:10.599
Helpful and quite lovely.

56:11.635 --> 56:14.236
She really loved the ornaments.

56:14.305 --> 56:17.606
I wanted to give her something
very special for Christmas.

56:17.641 --> 56:19.842
You're very talented.

56:19.877 --> 56:22.311
I took a few art
classes in college.

56:22.346 --> 56:24.413
Maybe there were
some aspirations.

56:25.516 --> 56:27.983
Perhaps Rome has
reawakened them.

56:29.420 --> 56:30.619
Not only Rome, Oliver.

56:32.156 --> 56:35.224
Where there is
passion, there is art.

56:39.830 --> 56:42.464
[phone jingling]

56:44.702 --> 56:45.868
Pronto.

56:45.936 --> 56:47.669
[Tomasso] <i> Ciao, Angela.</i>

56:47.738 --> 56:49.838
Tomasso, hi.

56:49.874 --> 56:52.641
I didn't expect to
hear from you again.

56:52.676 --> 56:54.610
Can I take you for a coffee?

56:55.980 --> 56:58.580
I'm sorry, I'm actually
really busy right now.

56:58.616 --> 57:01.383
Well, I was wondering if,

57:02.653 --> 57:05.621
do you want to
come back to work?

57:05.656 --> 57:09.024
- You fired me.
- I let you go.

57:09.059 --> 57:11.260
Isn't that the same thing?

57:11.295 --> 57:13.996
All right, I made a mistake

57:14.031 --> 57:16.965
and I apologize, Angela.

57:17.001 --> 57:17.966
Please, come back.

57:20.237 --> 57:22.671
I'm sorry, Tomasso, but no.

57:23.941 --> 57:26.341
Look, some of our online reviews

57:26.377 --> 57:28.510
mention you by name.

57:28.579 --> 57:30.546
<i>And the new customers
are asking for you.</i>

57:31.849 --> 57:33.849
I'm actually doing
my own thing now.

57:33.884 --> 57:36.351
I have a business plan and I'm
meeting with investors today.

57:37.755 --> 57:38.887
Ah.

57:38.956 --> 57:41.323
[gentle music]

57:54.905 --> 57:56.472
My tour isn't for people

57:56.507 --> 58:00.142
who want to just take the
top 10 selfies of Rome.

58:00.211 --> 58:04.746
I want to give people a true
Roman Christmas experience.

58:04.782 --> 58:06.515
I want to show them
the hidden corners,

58:06.550 --> 58:08.951
explain the legends,
taste the flavors.

58:08.986 --> 58:10.853
But just Christmas tours?

58:10.921 --> 58:12.221
No, not all.

58:12.256 --> 58:13.689
I do want the tours
to be seasonal

58:13.724 --> 58:16.658
and specific to what
the clients want.

58:16.694 --> 58:19.127
Think of a custom made
tour designed specifically

58:19.163 --> 58:20.662
for what you want.

58:20.698 --> 58:22.831
Just imagine experiencing Rome

58:22.900 --> 58:25.067
through the eyes
of a real Roman.

58:25.102 --> 58:26.735
I know the best
guides in the city

58:26.804 --> 58:28.437
and I can get them
to work for me.

58:28.472 --> 58:29.872
How ya gonna do that?

58:29.907 --> 58:31.573
By building in an
attractive bonus package

58:31.609 --> 58:33.075
based on sales.

58:33.110 --> 58:35.444
The tour company does
well, so do they.

58:35.479 --> 58:37.412
I've got 10 guides
already lined up

58:37.448 --> 58:38.881
and more calling every day.

58:38.949 --> 58:41.216
I have a web designer and
an online marketing team

58:41.252 --> 58:43.452
literally living in my building.

58:43.487 --> 58:44.520
I'm ready for this.

58:45.723 --> 58:47.089
I just need the seed money.

58:48.692 --> 58:49.825
Looks good.

58:51.195 --> 58:52.461
We'll think about it.

58:53.731 --> 58:54.863
Thank you.

58:54.899 --> 58:57.199
[gentle music]

59:03.707 --> 59:05.774
I brought you a coffee.

59:09.313 --> 59:10.746
Thank you, Luigi.

59:14.318 --> 59:15.384
I'm almost done.

59:17.154 --> 59:19.388
It's beautiful.

59:19.423 --> 59:22.491
You know, I realize that
these Christmas ornaments

59:22.526 --> 59:24.760
are only a small part
of your product line

59:24.795 --> 59:27.029
but whoever buys your company

59:27.064 --> 59:29.164
if they expand production,
I bet they could find

59:29.233 --> 59:31.166
a big audience for
these in America.

59:32.536 --> 59:33.969
I appreciate your advice.

59:35.072 --> 59:36.872
And you are probably right.

59:39.009 --> 59:40.409
But I have to let you know

59:41.445 --> 59:43.245
that I've made a decision

59:43.280 --> 59:44.813
about the future of my company.

59:46.817 --> 59:48.250
And?

59:48.285 --> 59:52.120
I told you that I wanted
to sell my company

59:52.156 --> 59:56.358
to somebody who understands
not just the business

59:56.393 --> 01:00:00.095
but also the heart and the soul

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.363
of what we're trying to do.

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:06.602
Somebody who understands
the soul of Rome.

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:15.677
Well, I'm grateful that
you gave us the opportunity

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:18.046
to bid for your company.

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:22.117
You and your family have built
something very special here

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:25.320
and, I only hope that
whoever the new owner is,

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:27.522
that they appreciate that.

01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:32.527
The company I chose

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:37.032
is yours.

01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:41.003
Seriously?

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.604
Yes, congratulations.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.641
Luigi, thank you for your trust.

01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:47.075
You won't regret it, I promise.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:58.453
Thank you for
lending me the dress.

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:00.589
You look so beautiful.

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:02.624
Thanks, I'm kind of nervous.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.159
That's a good sign.

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:05.927
It means you're excited
about your date.

01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:07.529
Oh, I don't know if
we're calling it a date.

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:09.765
I mean I don't think
it's like a "date" date.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.099
Is it a date?

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:14.069
It's totally a date.

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:15.303
But he's going back to New York.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:17.172
New York is not that far.

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:19.174
And people make long
distance relationships work

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:20.709
all the time.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:21.910
I don't know anyone who has.

01:01:21.945 --> 01:01:23.378
Well, you have haven't been out

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:25.213
on a decent date in forever.

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:26.648
Oh, well, thanks.

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:28.650
It's about time
you got out there.

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:32.220
[speaking Italian]

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.590
You look beautiful, let's go.

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:42.798
[gate squeaks]

01:01:47.838 --> 01:01:49.604
What is all this?

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.639
A celebration.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:53.375
Did you close the deal?

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.910
No work talk 'til after dinner.

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:57.479
I don't know if I
can wait that long.

01:01:57.514 --> 01:02:00.248
Well, then we better hurry.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:02.050
Where did you find a
horse and carriage?

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:03.719
You may be the best
tour guide in Rome

01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:05.721
but you're not the only
tour guide in Rome.

01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:08.023
[laughing]

01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:16.565
There we go.

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:34.750
My parents loved this city,

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:38.120
so living here it really
makes me feel close to them.

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:39.588
You are really lucky.

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.223
Honestly, most of the time,

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.125
I have no idea where I live.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.160
You're looking at a guy
who's on the road 200 days

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:47.028
out of the year.

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:48.964
Have you ever thought
about just settling down

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:50.499
some place you love?

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:51.967
Sure, someday.

01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:56.171
Someday, it's a dangerous word.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:06.648
Well, now that dinner's
done, how did it go

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:08.150
with the Fletchers?

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:09.951
You know, I think it went well.

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:11.353
They have a copy of
the business proposal

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:13.488
and they're gonna
think about it.

01:03:13.524 --> 01:03:15.157
That's great.

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:16.858
I wanted to say though,
that whatever happens,

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:18.894
this was a big
step forward for me

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.062
to do my first
official business pitch

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:24.666
and I really have you
to thank for that.

01:03:24.701 --> 01:03:28.303
And I have you to
thank for something.

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:30.705
As of this afternoon,
Fisk Drummond

01:03:30.741 --> 01:03:33.308
is acquiring
Forlinghetti Ceramics.

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:36.845
We did it, we convinced Luigi.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.414
Oliver, that is incredible.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.883
That's...
Wow, you did it.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:43.385
No, no, no, no.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:45.787
We did it, Angela,
and I couldn't have

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:47.489
What you taught me about Rome,

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:50.192
about baking, about life.

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:52.894
That's what convinced Luigi.

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:56.097
I'm really happy for you.

01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:01.036
I, um, got you a gift.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:03.805
Early Christmas present.

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:09.711
This is so nice.

01:04:14.618 --> 01:04:17.085
Oliver, this is so beautiful.

01:04:19.223 --> 01:04:20.188
This is...

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:23.692
It's from Luigi's studio, right?

01:04:23.727 --> 01:04:27.095
But, I don't remember
seeing this one.

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:30.465
That's because I
made it for you.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:34.636
You made this?

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:39.140
Yeah, those are all the
places you showed me.

01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:45.981
It's beautiful, thank you.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.249
Really, wow.

01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:50.619
Okay, well, the funny thing is,

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:52.420
I got you a Christmas
present too.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:58.360
Wow.

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:07.702
It's the picture
frame from the market.

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:09.504
Antique bronze from Verona.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:10.772
Very good.

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:17.512
And the picture
makes it perfect.

01:05:17.547 --> 01:05:19.147
Just wanted you to have
something to remember me by.

01:05:19.182 --> 01:05:21.416
Well, I won't need any
help to remember you.

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:23.018
But thank you, I love it.

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:28.690
[phone buzzing]

01:05:29.726 --> 01:05:30.892
It's my boss.

01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:31.927
No, you can take it, really,

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:32.961
I don't mind.

01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:34.262
I don't want to.

01:05:34.298 --> 01:05:35.697
There is nowhere
else in the world

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:37.032
that I would rather be right now

01:05:37.067 --> 01:05:38.533
than right here with you.

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:02.717
A woman knows these things.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.220
So, you're on your
way to the airport?

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:08.556
First, I'm meeting Luigi at
the Christmas caroling concert

01:17:08.591 --> 01:17:09.657
in St. Peter's Square.

01:17:09.692 --> 01:17:11.359
We wanted to see that too, but,

01:17:11.427 --> 01:17:14.161
shopping took too long and
there's not enough time.

01:17:14.197 --> 01:17:15.363
It starts in less than an hour.

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:16.464
And don't you have
a plane to catch?

01:17:16.499 --> 01:17:17.999
I'm gonna try to catch both.

01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:20.901
Really?
Well, see ya back in New York.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:24.005
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:28.476
If you really want to go
to the Christmas concert,

01:17:28.511 --> 01:17:29.977
I'm sure we can figure it out.

01:17:30.013 --> 01:17:31.545
Not with the traffic.

01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:33.714
Oliver's gonna be late
to meet Luigi there.

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:35.483
We have no chance.

01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:37.084
So, how about we drop these off

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.586
and get us a Christmas cocktail?

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:42.723
[suspenseful music]

01:17:55.872 --> 01:17:57.938
[Margaret and Jack chatting]

01:17:57.974 --> 01:17:59.073
Margaret, Jack, perfect!

01:17:59.108 --> 01:18:00.775
Have you seen Oliver?

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:02.510
Oh, you just missed him,
he left a few minutes ago.

01:18:02.545 --> 01:18:04.478
I've tried calling,
he's not answering.

01:18:04.514 --> 01:18:06.814
Oh, his phone's dead.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:08.816
Was he headed to the airport?

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:11.952
Yeah, no, he's on his way
to St. Peter's Square first.

01:18:11.988 --> 01:18:14.355
- For the concert?
- Yes, he's meeting Luigi there.

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:17.024
Thank you so much.

01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:19.360
Oh, you'll never make
it with the traffic.

01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:20.995
That's what Vespas are for.

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.996
Wait!

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.766
We wanna come too.

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:26.967
We do?

01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:28.202
Hurry up, Jack.

01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:29.236
Let's go.

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:32.673
[upbeat music]

01:18:33.943 --> 01:18:36.577
[motors humming]

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:54.762
Oh, we'll never find
him in this crowd.

01:18:54.797 --> 01:18:56.263
You know what?

01:18:56.332 --> 01:18:59.166
I gave him a GPS button
on our first day.

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:07.274
He's this way.

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:11.312
[choir singing "Adeste Fideles"]

01:19:27.797 --> 01:19:28.929
<i>Excuse.</i>

01:19:35.071 --> 01:19:37.738
Sorry.
Oliver!

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:38.739
Oliver!

01:19:44.814 --> 01:19:46.814
Angela, what are you doing here?

01:19:46.849 --> 01:19:48.315
How did you find me?

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:50.050
You still have your
GPS tracking device.

01:19:53.322 --> 01:19:54.955
I'm so happy you're here.

01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:57.124
Listen, I know you're
on your way to the airport

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.993
but I really need
to talk to you.

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:01.662
[choir singing]

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.800
It's magic.

01:20:05.835 --> 01:20:07.835
So beautiful.

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:09.804
I want to apologize for
walking out on you last night.

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:11.806
You don't need to apologize.

01:20:11.841 --> 01:20:13.874
Yes, I do. And I'm sorry for not
answering your calls this
morning.

01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:16.677
It's okay, I understand.

01:20:16.712 --> 01:20:18.712
I know we've only known
each other a few days

01:20:18.748 --> 01:20:21.682
and in some ways, we hardly
know each other at all

01:20:21.717 --> 01:20:25.886
but I feel so connected to you

01:20:25.922 --> 01:20:27.855
and I don't want to
lose that feeling.

01:20:29.559 --> 01:20:30.758
I don't want to lose you.

01:20:31.894 --> 01:20:33.494
I don't want to lose you either.

01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:36.463
I want to see where this goes

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:38.566
and if having a long
distance relationship is hard

01:20:38.601 --> 01:20:40.634
then it's hard.

01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:43.103
I mean nothing good
ever came easy.

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:48.943
But I say it's worth it,
I want to give this a shot.

01:20:48.978 --> 01:20:50.044
Well...

01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:52.847
Angela?

01:20:52.915 --> 01:20:55.249
You delivered quite
the Christmas miracle.

01:20:55.284 --> 01:20:57.651
The singing was divine,
thank you.

01:20:57.687 --> 01:20:58.652
It was my pleasure.

01:20:59.589 --> 01:21:01.555
Tell her, honey.

01:21:01.591 --> 01:21:03.524
We've looked at
your business plan

01:21:03.559 --> 01:21:05.426
and we want to invest with you.

01:21:06.963 --> 01:21:09.296
That's amazing.

01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:10.297
Oh my goodness, that is amazing.

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:11.398
Thank you so much.

01:21:11.434 --> 01:21:13.400
Angela, congratulations.

01:21:15.471 --> 01:21:17.605
I'm so happy for you.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.939
I don't want you to leave.

01:21:19.942 --> 01:21:21.542
I may not have to.

01:21:21.611 --> 01:21:23.310
Are you going back
to New York tonight?

01:21:23.346 --> 01:21:27.481
Hmm, three coins in the Trevi
Fountain said otherwise.

01:21:27.516 --> 01:21:30.217
Remember, one coin
brings you back to Rome,

01:21:30.253 --> 01:21:31.785
two coins brings you romance,

01:21:31.854 --> 01:21:33.520
and three coins...

01:21:33.556 --> 01:21:34.855
Leads you to true love.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.026
Angela, I appreciate you trying

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:40.928
to make our relationship
work long distance

01:21:40.963 --> 01:21:42.296
but I don't want
to be away from you

01:21:42.365 --> 01:21:44.331
not even for a minute.

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:47.635
So, I spoke to Estelle and Luigi

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:50.237
and I'll be running
Luigi's company from here.

01:21:53.109 --> 01:21:55.676
[speaking Italian]

01:21:55.711 --> 01:21:57.811
It might be a little bit
of a change of pace for me

01:21:57.847 --> 01:22:00.581
but I think a change
will do me good.

01:22:00.616 --> 01:22:02.049
But what about being VP?

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:03.651
That was your dream job.

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.819
Yeah, but it was
missing one thing.

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:07.354
What?

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:08.355
You.

01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:18.766
Um, can I show you something?

01:22:18.801 --> 01:22:19.833
Sure.

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:26.974
Just right over here.

01:22:27.009 --> 01:22:30.878
And, this is the spot.

01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:32.980
What spot?

01:22:33.015 --> 01:22:35.649
The spot from the
photo you showed me

01:22:35.718 --> 01:22:38.385
of your parents standing
in St. Peter's Square.

01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:41.188
The Christmas tree
was just to their left

01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:43.691
so they would have been
standing right here.

01:22:43.726 --> 01:22:45.559
You're right.

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:49.663
This is the spot my parents
stood in 40 years ago.

01:22:50.866 --> 01:22:52.967
It's amazing.

01:22:53.836 --> 01:22:55.269
I think it's a sign.

01:22:55.338 --> 01:22:58.105
I told you the city's magical.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.173
So are you.
