1:02:21.438 --> 1:02:22.738
And without help,

1:02:22.773 --> 1:02:24.973
it's likely to worsen
like your aunt's did.

1:02:27.811 --> 1:02:30.245
Here's an idea.

1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:32.581
I have a beautiful home.

1:02:32.616 --> 1:02:35.584
One of the perks
of working here.

1:02:35.619 --> 1:02:37.285
And I have a guesthouse.

1:02:37.321 --> 1:02:39.354
Why don't you
come stay with me?

1:02:39.456 --> 1:02:41.323
(Katie)
No, I couldn't.

1:02:41.458 --> 1:02:42.591
(Dr. Beck)
Of course you can.

1:02:42.626 --> 1:02:44.059
You'd have your own entrance,

1:02:44.094 --> 1:02:45.527
a full kitchen,

1:02:45.629 --> 1:02:48.096
a 60-inch plasma TV,
and a California king,

1:02:48.132 --> 1:02:51.233
stay as long as you like.

1:02:51.268 --> 1:02:53.001
Though I think we should
probably keep it a secret

1:02:53.137 --> 1:02:55.470
from the powers that be.

1:02:55.506 --> 1:02:56.905
And the great thing
about it is,

1:02:56.940 --> 1:02:59.307
we could start your treatment
immediately.

1:02:59.343 --> 1:03:04.579
(Katie)
That's so generous,
but I can't, it's too much.

1:03:04.615 --> 1:03:07.516
(Dr. Beck)
As your doctor, I insist.

1:03:07.618 --> 1:03:08.784
I couldn't bear it
if you were to follow

1:03:08.819 --> 1:03:10.252
in your aunt's footsteps,

1:03:10.287 --> 1:03:12.087

Well, I'm not gonna
give up on her.

1:03:16.627 --> 1:03:18.026
I'm gonna make sure
she ends up in a place

1:03:18.128 --> 1:03:21.296
that really gives her
the care she needs.

1:03:50.828 --> 1:03:52.828
(Dr. Beck)
Maybe I overdid the sedatives.

1:03:52.863 --> 1:03:56.898

a bit.

New Mexico
Correctional Hospital

-What?

No, no. No, no,
I don't-I-I-I...

1:04:07.678 --> 1:04:09.110
I wanna talk
to my doctor,

1:04:09.213 --> 1:04:10.946
I wanna talk to
the doctor in charge, now!

1:04:11.048 --> 1:04:12.681
What a coincidence!

1:04:12.716 --> 1:04:15.417
Because I happen to be
your primary care physician.

1:04:15.519 --> 1:04:17.252
Michelle, I'm sorry
I couldn't help you,

1:04:17.354 --> 1:04:18.887
but your condition was
far more advanced

1:04:18.922 --> 1:04:20.455
than I realized.

1:04:20.557 --> 1:04:22.157
So desperate to help
another person

1:04:22.192 --> 1:04:23.959
when you couldn't even
help yourself.

1:04:24.061 --> 1:04:27.529
However, you certainly
took care of Dr. Newman.

1:04:27.564 --> 1:04:29.931

I don't know how you did it,
but you did it.

1:04:35.205 --> 1:04:36.504
Okay, everything went to hell

1:04:36.540 --> 1:04:38.607
the day you walked
into my life.

1:04:38.742 --> 1:04:40.876
