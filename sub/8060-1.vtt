00:19.436 --> 00:21.812
(sobbing)

01:18.578 --> 01:22.081
- Cuban.
- What's the word, Sawyer?

01:26.169 --> 01:28.003
SAWYER: Looks like a match.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.550
JOE: Yeah, it's Joe.
We've got a series.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.595
Same M.O.,
same signature, no DNA.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.890
Not one goddamn shred.

01:40.058 --> 01:43.227
You said that already.
I'm doing everything I can.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.104
(phone beeps)

01:45.814 --> 01:47.439
Goddamn fucking asshole.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.944
- (water trickling)
- (under breath) Fuck.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.413
I need to go see him.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.375
Joe.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.215
I think it's a mistake.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.552
You're entitled to your own opinion.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.554
Well, let me rephrase that.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.639
I think it's a big mistake.

02:20.807 --> 02:24.893
Apart from time and resources,
it's bringing an unknown into a...

02:25.061 --> 02:27.855
- into a really bad situation.
- Not unknown at all.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.275
I've worked with him before,
and he's actually my friend.

02:31.442 --> 02:34.111
- You said he's unstable.
- I did not, Katherine.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.655
I said he's had a hard time.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.702
It's too early
for a Hail Mary, Joe.

02:44.706 --> 02:48.333
You will learn it's never too early
for one of those.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.294
(siren wailing in distance)

02:50.461 --> 02:51.920
(footsteps)

02:58.761 --> 03:01.388
JOE:
Goddamn, are you seeing this?

03:01.556 --> 03:05.017
I mean, look at all this...
pretty green shit.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.899
How long has
he lived out here?

03:13.109 --> 03:16.403
Two years.
Ever since his daughter Emma died.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.989
Leukemia. In his arms.

03:25.705 --> 03:30.125
Gave up his medical practice.
Hell, he gave up everything.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.342
What happened to his wife?

03:40.929 --> 03:44.139
Well, therein lies
the truth about tragedies.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.184
They bring some people
closer together...

03:48.645 --> 03:50.312
...drives others apart.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.955
JOE: There it is.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.964
Do you mind staying here?
Let me talk to him alone?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.716
- You could have left me in the city.
- I could've...

04:20.885 --> 04:24.012
But you would have missed
the pretty green shit.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.889
(car bleeps)

04:29.394 --> 04:30.936
Sentiment.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.240
(creaking)

04:50.915 --> 04:52.499
JOHN: Yeah?

04:55.545 --> 04:58.088
- John? It's Joe.
- JOHN: Yeah, I know.

05:00.842 --> 05:04.344
Are you gonna open the door?
I'd like to talk to you.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.054
JOHN: Not interested.

05:06.597 --> 05:09.850
John, I just drove three hours
to come and see you.

05:10.268 --> 05:14.354
Come on. You know me well enough
to know that I'm not leaving.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.149
And I'll kick down this door
if I have to.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.409
JOHN: A real pain in the ass.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.288
Yeah. I've heard that before.

05:40.923 --> 05:46.386
You know, I sent you a letter
like a year ago. Did you get it?

05:46.554 --> 05:48.722
- (liquid pouring)
- Yep.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.017
What did it say, John?

05:55.646 --> 05:58.023
"No parent should
outlive a child."

06:16.125 --> 06:18.794
- So you've been holed up here.
- Uh-huh.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.381
I see you've settled in.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.806
- It's a beautiful day out there.
- That's what they tell me.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.934
So you don't get out much?

06:54.580 --> 06:58.583
(phone rings)

07:00.420 --> 07:02.963
- Do you want a soda?
- JOE: No, thank you.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.673
I don't have cigarettes.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.716
I gave them up a few months ago.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.718
Meet my new addiction.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.806
Laura and the kid okay?

07:12.974 --> 07:15.142
Yeah, they're good.
Thank you.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.477
Heard from Elizabeth yet?

07:17.645 --> 07:19.020
No.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.523
You will.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.236
So, besides wanting
to see you...

07:27.989 --> 07:31.575
I've got a situation that
I'd like you to take a look at.

07:32.201 --> 07:35.996
- I could just tell you about the victims.
- I'm not interested.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.457
By the way,
who's your girlfriend?

07:42.128 --> 07:45.589
That is my loyal partner,
Agent Cowles,

07:45.756 --> 07:49.009
who apparently doesn't listen
to a fucking word I say.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.844
KATHERINE: S.A.C., Joe.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.848
I thought you might
want to take the call.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.558
Excuse me, John.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.403
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.449
- I brought the case files.
- It wasn't necessary.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.660
The Agency has
changed the guidelines

08:15.828 --> 08:18.246
for the way we break down
the cases.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.332
It makes them more readable.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.334
Oh. Well, that's a relief.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.921
We gotta go.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.054
Three murders.
Identical M.O.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.181
JOE: Agent Cowles.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.149
(high-pitched distortion)

08:47.902 --> 08:49.986
I'll leave the case files here.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.577
John.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.830
You okay?

09:02.583 --> 09:05.043
If you change your mind
about this...

09:06.587 --> 09:08.505
...you know where to find me.

09:14.178 --> 09:17.138
(opera music plays)

09:28.818 --> 09:31.152
(distorted conversation)

09:31.320 --> 09:33.488
(distorted screaming)

09:42.748 --> 09:45.709
(opera music continues)

09:59.348 --> 10:01.266
(hums)

10:08.733 --> 10:12.152
(hums along to music)

10:15.740 --> 10:18.700
(crescendo)

10:32.006 --> 10:34.966
(opera music continues)

10:56.280 --> 10:58.615
(whirring)

11:27.144 --> 11:29.479
- JOHN: Hey, Joe.
- JOE: John.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.190
I make no promises.

11:32.358 --> 11:36.277
I'll stay maybe one day.
Maybe one week.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.697
Deal. No promises.

11:40.282 --> 11:43.118
- You knew I'd come back?
- I had high hopes.

11:43.994 --> 11:47.414
You remember Agent Cowles?
I should say "Dr." Cowles,

11:47.581 --> 11:50.625
- with a doctorate in...?
- Psychopathology.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.754
She was to become a professor
before the bureau snagged her.

11:54.922 --> 11:59.008
- You gave up academia for this madhouse?
- They let me carry a gun.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.386
Wow! So sexy.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.598
JOE: You two will
make a good team.

12:05.766 --> 12:10.270
John, you know when and Katherine, you
know why someone's about to do something.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.731
Run this through until we come out.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.735
Dr. Clancy, before we go upstairs,
with all due respect,

12:16.902 --> 12:20.739
I don't hold an ounce of confidence
in the paranormal as a field.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.408
I think it's a sham.
I hope that's okay.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.536
No problem at all.
I feel the same about shrinks.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.038
After only one thing,
your money.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.040
They'll take your whole hand.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.377
Whoever said that has obviously
never met a good one.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.087
It was Sigmund Freud.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.173
(elevator bell dings)

12:40.551 --> 12:43.136
Like I said, a hell of a team.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.765
Consistency #1: method.

12:46.932 --> 12:50.727
KATHERINE: Each victim was killed by
a puncture wound at the skull.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.272
Inflicted by
a five-inch instrument.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.275
It went straight into
the medulla oblongata.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.820
Immediate, according to the coroner.
Painless execution.

13:00.988 --> 13:06.284
- JOHN: These photos are all post-mortem.
- A couple of them almost look alive.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.953
KATHERINE: Consistency #2:
No mistakes.

13:09.121 --> 13:15.210
Crime scenes so far have yielded
no evidence of DNA, hair-fibers,

13:15.377 --> 13:18.129
- shoe-prints, nothing.
- No witnesses, either.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.925
Ward lived in a secured building.
No signs of forced entry.

13:22.092 --> 13:28.014
On the psych front, it's unheard of.
There's no geographical, chronological

13:28.182 --> 13:30.892
or astrological pattern
to the murder.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.268
No robbery.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.898
JOE: Other than that,
we got a good handle on this case.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.858
- (distortion)
- (high-pitched tone)

13:41.278 --> 13:42.529
John?

13:44.114 --> 13:45.323
John.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.242
Yeah.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.913
Robert Ellis,
the kid in Mount Pleasant.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.166
- JOHN: He was eating ice cream.
- He was.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.255
Where do you want to start,
John?

14:01.257 --> 14:02.549
Well...

14:03.801 --> 14:05.760
- ...at the beginning?
- (door opens)

14:11.809 --> 14:16.020
The residence of
Mrs. Ethel Jackson, age 69.

14:16.981 --> 14:20.358
She lived alone with three cats.
Was a regular at church.

14:20.526 --> 14:25.029
Landlady grew suspicious when she
hadn't seen or talked to her in two days.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.907
She was found killed
in that rocking chair.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.035
On the TV,
the Cooking Channel played.

14:31.495 --> 14:34.163
And the note we were looking at earlier?

14:34.331 --> 14:36.916
Was here.
On this table.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.168
(phone rings)

14:40.462 --> 14:42.130
My wife.
I need to take this.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.340
Sweetheart, I...

14:48.596 --> 14:51.306
- What do you make of the note?
- As a shrink?

14:51.473 --> 14:54.100
- Yeah.
- It's a classic riddle.

14:55.477 --> 15:00.315
"I will tell you in two words who I am,
what I do and how I live. May I?"

15:01.817 --> 15:04.652
KATHERINE: Taunting questions
designed to mislead.

15:05.446 --> 15:09.532
Asking our permission to reveal himself,
yet never intending to.

15:11.243 --> 15:16.664
It's playful, but only one person
is playing here. It's solitaire.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.711
Or is it something more?

15:22.338 --> 15:23.880
Is it a cry for help?

15:24.048 --> 15:26.966
An indication of
split personality disorder,

15:27.134 --> 15:30.261
where the riddler is
asking themselves, and us,

15:30.429 --> 15:34.724
who they actually are? But no.
That's not consistent with the crime.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.977
This is too controlled,
too sharp.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.563
There's something else
going on here.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.610
It's like he's looking for
someone.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.446
(clattering)

15:58.624 --> 16:01.751
- So?
- She likes hats.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.214
Hey. How are we doing?

16:06.382 --> 16:07.632
JOHN: Fantastic.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.137
(blows)

16:16.517 --> 16:19.727
Katherine works up a full
profile based on the note.

16:19.895 --> 16:23.606
- Which she's finishing at home.
- JOHN: Okay.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.025
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yes.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.027
John.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.407
How about I buy you dinner?
Special treat. Best place in town.

16:32.574 --> 16:33.783
Do I need a jacket?

16:33.951 --> 16:38.204
Hell, no, you don't. I got connections.
I know the maître d'.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.876
Goddamn it.
This is so good!

16:44.044 --> 16:46.045
- John?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

16:46.213 --> 16:49.090
- For John, one more please. Yeah?
- VENDOR: Coming up.

16:49.550 --> 16:53.553
My boy has a rough time in school.
Came home in tears again today.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.346
- Being bullied?
- Yeah.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.056
I don't know what to do.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.644
Don't know. Give him a hug.
Tell him a joke.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.189
- A joke?
- Yeah. A joke.

17:05.648 --> 17:09.027
I don't know any jokes.
I'm serious, John. Come on.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.863
In the name of friendship,
tell me a joke.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.406
Me?
I don't know any jokes.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.367
Okay, just one. Um...

17:17.703 --> 17:20.204
This woman, Mrs. Jones, uh,

17:20.664 --> 17:23.290
was suffering from
a rare heart condition.

17:23.459 --> 17:28.588
The doctor prescribes male hormones
to up her testosterone, 2 pills a day.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.841
A month later
she goes back to the doctor and says...

17:32.009 --> 17:34.969
"That medicine
is doing wonders for my heart.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.806
But I'm growing hair
where it has never grown before."

17:38.974 --> 17:44.228
"Don't worry, excessive hair is to be
expected. Where does it grow exactly?"

17:44.396 --> 17:46.564
She says, "On my balls, Doctor."

17:50.360 --> 17:51.903
It's funny, isn't it?

17:53.030 --> 17:55.156
I can't tell that
to my little boy.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.826
- Say "testicles."
- That cleans it right up.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.079
- Yeah. Biology.
- (chuckling)

18:02.039 --> 18:03.790
- It's a good joke.
- Yeah.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.042
I thought you'd like that.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.670
Elizabeth told me
that's why she fell in love with you.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.466
- Why was that?
- That smile.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.803
- Oh, the smile.
- Not your joke telling.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.429
(distorted, echoing thud)

18:23.644 --> 18:25.269
- (thud)
- (agonized screaming)

18:27.356 --> 18:30.983
John, do I have another
sandwich coming here or what?

18:50.838 --> 18:53.965
JOE: Tonight, as we were
leaving Ethel Jackson's,

18:54.133 --> 18:56.300
- you were onto something.
- Hmm.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.432
Come on, John. Talk to me.
What do you know?

19:06.103 --> 19:09.021
I want this over as quickly
and as badly as you do,

19:09.189 --> 19:11.774
but you gotta tell me
what you're seeing.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.484
I don't know yet.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.633
- (monitor bleeping steadily)
- (sobbing)

19:51.565 --> 19:53.191
John...

19:53.358 --> 19:55.151
(distorted screaming)

20:05.245 --> 20:06.954
MAN: John.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.338
(snarling)

20:25.224 --> 20:26.766
(gunshot)

20:26.934 --> 20:30.102
- (knocking)
- JOE: Received an anonymous call

20:30.270 --> 20:35.816
an hour ago offering way too specific
information about the Peter Ward murder.

20:35.984 --> 20:41.197
Then listed a midtown address. Perimeter
is secured. They wait for us to go in.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.616
(loud thud)

20:46.078 --> 20:47.620
SLOMAN: Clear!

20:48.997 --> 20:50.539
AGENT: Clear!

20:57.381 --> 21:00.007
Joe.
Take a look at this.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.060
What do you think?

21:11.228 --> 21:14.313
Four-sixteen. Bible verse?

21:14.481 --> 21:16.524
No, it's the time.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.859
Four minutes ago.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.280
Four-sixteen precisely.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.407
Your watch is fast.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.784
Fuck. He's here.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.500
(door closes)

21:39.756 --> 21:42.216
(1950's pop music
plays over stereo)

21:49.933 --> 21:52.476
- Are you good?
- I'm good. Go.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.732
KATHERINE: Mrs. Raymond? FBI.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.984
(music continues)

22:13.707 --> 22:16.625
Would someone please
turn that shit off?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.003
(music stops)

22:23.133 --> 22:26.427
SLOMAN: Bingo.
KATHERINE: Wound on the back of the neck.

22:26.595 --> 22:30.014
- Familiar.
- She's been dead for 5 or 6 hours.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.017
- Perp must have hung around.
- He left hours ago.

22:37.272 --> 22:40.441
Would you two mind
clearing the room for us please?

22:41.109 --> 22:42.651
Thank you.

22:45.989 --> 22:47.531
John.

22:49.659 --> 22:53.496
JOE: Same type font as 4:16
and the note at Ethel Jackson's.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.206
Mm-hmm.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.459
(coughing)

22:58.627 --> 23:01.003
- You okay?
- Shit.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.006
- Go ahead. Take a look.
- Can I touch her?

23:04.174 --> 23:05.716
Yeah.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.901
- (indistinct whispering)
- David.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.117
(1950's pop music plays)

23:31.284 --> 23:33.369
- (door closes)
- David?

23:53.265 --> 23:56.225
(music continues)

24:07.154 --> 24:09.238
(music fades)

24:29.301 --> 24:32.720
- (door opens)
- There you are. Come in.

24:34.389 --> 24:35.931
Wash my back.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.523
(slicing)

24:46.067 --> 24:47.109
John?

24:48.695 --> 24:50.738
- You all right?
- Yeah.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.700
- What do you see?
- I'm not sure.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.244
(indistinct voices in background)

25:03.585 --> 25:05.836
- Okay.
- What?

25:07.923 --> 25:10.341
- Don't touch the bathwater.
- Why?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.176
I'm not sure why.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.720
Joe? Holy shit,
we may have a suspect.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.430
- Who?
- David Raymond.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.516
The husband.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.728
(door opens)

25:29.611 --> 25:31.904
SAWYER: He says
he was at the bar all night.

25:32.072 --> 25:35.574
His bartender and his breath
corroborate his story.

25:36.660 --> 25:40.204
- JOE: Agent Cowles are you ready?
- KATHERINE: Yes, sir.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.122
I want you to take the lead.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.500
(she sighs)

25:45.001 --> 25:46.835
- (door opens)
- (bleep)

25:54.511 --> 25:58.222
Mr. Raymond, a cup of coffee.

25:58.390 --> 26:02.184
- Been a long night for all of us.
- DAVID: Thank you.

26:03.311 --> 26:04.812
If you don't mind...

26:05.814 --> 26:08.732
...I'm just gonna jump
right into this. Okay?

26:08.900 --> 26:10.693
- Mr. Raymond.
- Yeah?

26:11.361 --> 26:14.738
We regret to inform you that
your wife Victoria

26:15.198 --> 26:16.740
died last night.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.286
DAVID: Jesus.

26:21.204 --> 26:22.746
Jesus Christ.

26:26.126 --> 26:29.545
Oh, God. Oh, God...
(breaks down)

26:30.255 --> 26:32.089
KATHERINE: Mr. Raymond...

26:32.882 --> 26:35.718
...you were seen leaving your building

26:35.885 --> 26:39.305
last night in an agitated state.
Can you tell us why?

26:40.056 --> 26:41.724
Did she leave a note?

26:41.891 --> 26:43.434
Did she leave a note?

26:44.686 --> 26:46.979
Mr. Raymond,
your wife was murdered.

26:47.147 --> 26:50.357
- What?
- Your wife was murdered.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.109
She didn't leave a note.

26:52.485 --> 26:55.446
No! No! Oh, Jesus, God!

26:56.114 --> 26:59.742
- What do you think happened?
- She didn't commit suicide?

26:59.909 --> 27:01.452
Why do you think that?

27:03.496 --> 27:06.290
The letter, I wrote... I...
I wrote a letter.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.796
- This letter?
- No. What is that?

27:14.007 --> 27:15.549
You didn't write this?

27:16.176 --> 27:17.926
I left a letter.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.428
What did it say?

27:22.932 --> 27:24.391
KATHERINE: David?

27:33.443 --> 27:35.694
- (distorted voices)
- (groaning)

27:36.404 --> 27:39.323
"I never meant to hurt
or betray..."

27:42.410 --> 27:44.953
- (groaning)
- (sobbing)

27:49.668 --> 27:52.419
David?
What did the letter say?

27:54.130 --> 27:55.506
He left her.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.758
I was leaving her.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.761
JOE: Okay.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.305
JOE:
You were leaving her. Why?

28:04.140 --> 28:05.724
He left her for someone else.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.185
I was leaving her
for someone else.

28:11.731 --> 28:12.898
(groaning)

28:16.152 --> 28:17.903
- For another woman?
- (groaning)

28:23.576 --> 28:25.327
Yes.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.788
He's lying.

28:29.457 --> 28:31.583
Oh, V, I'm so sorry.

28:35.296 --> 28:37.339
- (groaning)
- (sobbing)

28:40.051 --> 28:43.053
Uh, could I have a word with
Mr. Raymond?

28:43.221 --> 28:44.680
- Dr. Clancy...
- Joe?

28:45.390 --> 28:46.932
- All right.
- Thanks.

28:57.485 --> 29:00.654
You're telling the truth,
or at least some of it.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.908
You didn't kill your wife
did you, Mr. Raymond?

29:05.827 --> 29:06.869
No.

29:07.579 --> 29:12.458
But you believe the note you left
could've driven her to take her own life.

29:13.334 --> 29:17.546
Your wife had a history of
emotional instability.

29:19.257 --> 29:23.510
And the note was telling her that you
were leaving her for someone else.

29:25.305 --> 29:30.517
But your note failed to mention
you were leaving her for a man.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.483
- (groaning)
- (distorted voices)

29:40.862 --> 29:42.821
How the fuck do you know that?

29:42.989 --> 29:46.950
That, in fact,
you had contracted HIV.

29:49.412 --> 29:50.954
Is that right?

29:56.127 --> 29:57.669
(sobbing)

30:00.924 --> 30:02.758
(door opens)

30:05.261 --> 30:07.304
JOE: Her blood was contaminated.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.432
That's why:
"Careful with the bathwater."

30:10.600 --> 30:12.518
I want to see the files again.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.563
It's 7:30. My family's up.
Breakfast?

30:16.731 --> 30:18.273
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.359
(long beep)

30:27.033 --> 30:29.076
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Laura.

30:29.577 --> 30:32.204
- You need to eat.
- I'm good, baby. Thank you.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.415
- Family is looking good, Joe.
- They are.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.752
I try to spend as much time
as I can with them.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.337
We've seen Elizabeth.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.216
- Oh, yeah?
- We've kept in touch.

30:44.884 --> 30:47.469
- Good.
- She still loves you, John.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.143
All right. So, uh...
What do you think?

30:55.311 --> 30:58.313
They were all
incurably sick, terminally ill.

30:58.481 --> 31:02.317
- That is the consistency.
- We explored that. It doesn't hold up.

31:02.485 --> 31:05.195
Ethel Jackson.
The wigs, the hats...

31:05.363 --> 31:08.198
- She had chemotherapy.
- Three years ago.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.909
She was in the clear, John.

31:11.077 --> 31:12.828
No one's ever in the clear.

31:13.204 --> 31:18.542
80 % of cancers return. Whenever they do,
they're quite difficult to eliminate.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.089
So?

31:24.257 --> 31:27.384
Peter Ward, it turns out,
had Lou Gehrig's Disease.

31:27.552 --> 31:30.220
That can be a very slow,
painful death.

31:30.388 --> 31:33.682
Victoria Raymond suffered
chronic suicidal depression,

31:33.850 --> 31:38.186
self-destructive behavior,
cutting, overdose, and so on.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.731
- LAURA: Finished breakfast?
- KEVIN: Yes!

31:40.899 --> 31:42.524
Hey. Backpack!

31:43.276 --> 31:44.818
KEVIN: Yes.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.614
Come here, say goodbye to John.

31:48.781 --> 31:50.616
- Bye-bye, John.
- Goodbye, monkey.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.326
Give your dad a hug.

31:53.244 --> 31:57.456
- Bye, Dad. See you after school.
- Yeah. Have a good day.

31:57.624 --> 31:58.790
Okay.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.377
- KEVIN: Have a good day at work.
- LAURA: Bye, honey.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.129
- (sighs)
- (door closes)

32:04.297 --> 32:07.549
Let's say I give you Ethel Jackson
and Peter Ward.

32:07.717 --> 32:10.802
Two words that destroy
this whole theory:

32:11.220 --> 32:13.430
The boy Robert Ellis was healthy,

32:13.598 --> 32:17.476
and as Christian Scientists,
his parents don't believe in medicine.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.311
He had no medical file.

32:19.479 --> 32:21.229
- Well, let's go talk to them.
- Okay.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.482
LAURA: Remember your appointment?

32:23.650 --> 32:28.528
Right. I have a phone call with the
director at 9:00 am,

32:28.696 --> 32:33.367
which I am immensely looking forward to.
So Katherine will take you.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.077
Okay.

32:36.245 --> 32:37.996
KATHERINE: Dr. Clancy...

32:39.540 --> 32:41.083
How do you refer to it?

32:42.085 --> 32:43.585
To what?

32:43.753 --> 32:47.255
To, uh, what you have?

32:48.424 --> 32:51.927
Is it prescience,
clairvoyance, precognition?

32:52.095 --> 32:54.763
Oh, it's a hoot.
A laugh a minute.

32:55.598 --> 32:58.141
Never mind. I'm serious.

33:00.269 --> 33:01.937
What is it you see exactly?

33:02.105 --> 33:05.023
Do you see people's futures?

33:05.566 --> 33:08.193
Bits of their futures
and of their pasts.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.404
It's all the same in the end.

33:10.571 --> 33:13.615
- Is it mystical? Or religious?
- No. I'm a scientist.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.576
I believe in
theoretical physics and...

33:17.036 --> 33:18.954
biochemistry and that's it.

33:19.122 --> 33:23.834
Whatever it is, I happen to get
the deluxe edition of what people now call

33:24.002 --> 33:25.836
intuition or gut reaction.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.882
Do you see anything now?

33:31.718 --> 33:34.052
What do you mean? About you?

33:35.263 --> 33:37.139
I guess so.

33:38.474 --> 33:40.017
No. Nothing.

33:40.476 --> 33:42.811
- At all?
- At all.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.938
Just nothing.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.065
JOHN: Nothing at all.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.742
MR. ELLIS:
So how's the investigation going?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.286
It's improving.

33:59.454 --> 34:04.666
We believe we know why
your son was killed. Why he was chosen.

34:05.626 --> 34:09.713
Mr. Ellis, I need to ask you a few
questions but I don't want to upset you.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.132
It's all right. Ask.
If I can, I'd like to help.

34:13.717 --> 34:19.056
Do you remember in the weeks
or months leading up to Robert's death,

34:19.223 --> 34:22.100
was he at his best?
Was he healthy?

34:23.018 --> 34:26.021
- Perfectly.
- He never complained of any pain?

34:26.188 --> 34:30.484
Did he ever have trouble keeping up
with other boys at school?

34:30.650 --> 34:32.944
Was he ever short of breath?

34:33.654 --> 34:36.614
Uh... No. No.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.623
- Be careful.
- I will.

34:49.712 --> 34:51.254
Robert was a sculptor?

34:51.422 --> 34:52.964
Yeah. He enjoys it.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.967
He enjoyed it.
He had very good hands.

34:57.136 --> 35:00.180
(sobs)

35:00.348 --> 35:02.390
KATHERINE:
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ellis.

35:13.152 --> 35:16.071
- They're beautiful.
- Thank you.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.615
What happened to this one?

35:19.617 --> 35:22.744
He knocked it over
maybe a day or two before...

35:24.872 --> 35:26.665
How did he knock it over?

35:26.833 --> 35:29.918
I don't remember.
Kids are clumsy.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.586
Robert especially?

35:32.296 --> 35:33.839
Well...

35:34.423 --> 35:37.968
Sometimes.
He'd upset his glass at dinner...

35:38.136 --> 35:41.972
- MRS. ELLIS: You're talking to them?
- They just got here.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.808
Did you catch him?

35:45.184 --> 35:46.726
KATHERINE: No.

35:48.354 --> 35:51.398
- Then what are you doing here?
- Mrs. Ellis...

35:51.816 --> 35:54.067
There was another murder
last night.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.237
We believe it's the same man
that killed your son.

35:57.905 --> 36:03.076
All of the other victims have suffered
from an illness or a condition...

36:03.244 --> 36:07.706
- Robert was 12. He wasn't sick.
- We'd like to verify that.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.332
How are you going to do that?

36:09.500 --> 36:11.877
KATHERINE: We conduct an autopsy.

36:12.044 --> 36:16.131
You dig his body up, pry him open
and search around inside him?

36:16.299 --> 36:17.716
JOHN: Yes, we do.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.510
- Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.346
He wasn't sick.

36:24.307 --> 36:27.559
And even if he was,
he did not need a man like you.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.813
It's fate.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.817
It's just that some people
do not have the courage

36:35.985 --> 36:38.111
to accept the wisdom of the Lord.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.948
I agree with you, Mrs. Ellis, absolutely.

36:42.992 --> 36:45.368
I know the limitations of medicine,

36:45.536 --> 36:49.831
I've diagnosed many patients
with death growing inside them.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.709
Like my own daughter.
She had Leukemia.

36:52.877 --> 36:56.171
JOHN: For 2 years,
I went to the hospital every day

36:56.339 --> 36:57.881
and watched her suffer.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.927
Every procedure, every test,
all totally useless, of course.

37:02.511 --> 37:04.763
And one day she died.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.016
And that was that.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.478
JOHN: In the end,
it was a blessing.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.898
I do understand something about fate,
Mrs. Ellis.

37:15.524 --> 37:20.278
And, uh, I certainly wouldn't use
medicine to alter God's plan.

37:20.446 --> 37:24.324
I... just want to know
why your son was killed.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.327
And medicine can help me
discover that.

37:27.787 --> 37:30.372
And then, perhaps, it can
help me catch the man...

37:31.582 --> 37:34.000
...who killed your little boy.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.425
(loud whirring)

38:03.656 --> 38:05.407
(bell rings)

38:05.574 --> 38:09.077
FIBBIE: Dr. Clancy. Fax for you.
It's marked urgent.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.793
What is it?

38:18.838 --> 38:21.047
Check the cerebellar lobe.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.848
PATHOLOGIST: Whoa!
What is this?

38:30.308 --> 38:33.018
- Well, there's your answer.
- JOE: What?

38:35.313 --> 38:37.731
Brain tumor. Size of a pea.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.191
Hidden in the cerebellar lobe.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.901
(bell rings)

38:45.948 --> 38:48.450
- JOE: John?
- What's up, Doc?

38:50.161 --> 38:51.202
Christ!

39:00.254 --> 39:03.965
- JOE: John?
- JOHN: I'm out. Finished.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.844
(door opens)

39:10.389 --> 39:12.974
The fax?
What the hell did it say?

39:13.434 --> 39:16.311
I don't know.
It was urgent and confidential.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.605
Somebody trained you too well.

39:21.275 --> 39:22.817
John!

39:23.402 --> 39:26.446
Goddamn it!
You gotta let somebody in on this!

39:27.448 --> 39:33.286
- We're walking right into a trap.
- What? You gotta talk to me.

39:34.705 --> 39:38.291
He's way ahead of us.
And we do exactly what he wants us to do.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.001
Don't you get it?

39:41.587 --> 39:43.129
I'm out.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.229
(thunder rumbles)

40:07.279 --> 40:09.030
Doctor Clancy?

40:21.961 --> 40:23.711
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:29.677 --> 40:32.720
- Do you mind?
- Go ahead. You're paying for it.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.689
So, we find a tumor...

40:43.149 --> 40:45.358
that no one could've
known about.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.902
We've established connections

40:48.070 --> 40:52.031
between victims that, I freely admit,
I could never have seen.

40:52.533 --> 40:55.660
And instead of stepping up
and leading from the front,

40:55.828 --> 40:59.164
you run out of an autopsy,
which you asked for,

40:59.623 --> 41:02.667
coincidentally,
without any explanation,

41:02.835 --> 41:07.130
and now you're packing your bags
and you're going home.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.757
Forgive me, Clancy,

41:10.634 --> 41:12.177
but what the fuck?

41:12.678 --> 41:14.220
Hmm.

41:16.348 --> 41:17.891
"Who am I?

41:18.517 --> 41:22.896
I will tell you in two words
who I am, what I do, and how I live."

41:23.063 --> 41:25.023
What about that riddle?

41:25.191 --> 41:27.150
- It's not a riddle.
- What is it?

41:27.318 --> 41:30.945
"Le diro con due parole,
chi son, e che faccio, come vivo."

41:31.113 --> 41:35.283
- It's from La Bohème by Puccini.
- So the killer is an opera nut.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.911
That really helps with the profile.

41:38.078 --> 41:39.621
- Thank you, Clancy.
- No.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.916
I'm the nut.
I'm the opera nut.

41:45.336 --> 41:50.632
I happened to be listening to those lines,
the very moment I read your case files.

41:51.175 --> 41:55.220
- I... I don't get it.
- He knew I'd be listening to that music.

41:55.387 --> 41:57.805
He knew that you would ask me to help.

41:57.973 --> 42:03.478
He knew we would arrive at the
apartment at exactly 4:16 am.

42:03.646 --> 42:08.358
Because he knows everything.

42:09.652 --> 42:13.821
You see... He's just like me.
He sees things.

42:14.281 --> 42:16.366
Only he's better at it.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.910
A whole lot better.
Come, read that.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.912
Come on, read it!

42:33.884 --> 42:35.802
"Dr. Clancy,

42:40.683 --> 42:42.392
Check the cerebellar lobe."

42:44.520 --> 42:45.853
Okay.

42:47.064 --> 42:49.148
So that's why you're quitting.

42:49.650 --> 42:52.110
- You've met your match.
- (chuckles)

42:52.695 --> 42:54.237
Oh, no.

42:54.655 --> 42:57.699
No. This guy, he's way beyond me.

42:58.242 --> 43:01.578
I can't stop him,
which begs a more important question.

43:01.745 --> 43:06.916
Is he really worth stopping?
These victims, they were dying anyway.

43:07.084 --> 43:11.087
He's not killing them out of
compulsion, or anger, or any...

43:11.547 --> 43:13.631
deviant psychosis or so.

43:13.799 --> 43:19.220
No, he's the cigar, the ice cream,
the cocktails, the flowers in the bathtub

43:19.388 --> 43:23.057
and all that whacko stuff.
This guy is brilliant.

43:23.225 --> 43:26.519
And he's killing them
with kindness.

43:28.897 --> 43:30.940
Get it?
It's mercy killing.

43:31.108 --> 43:33.109
- KATHERINE: Bullshit!
- Is it?

43:33.277 --> 43:35.320
- It's murder.
- Mm-hmm.

43:36.405 --> 43:38.781
That may spare
a lot of suffering.

43:38.949 --> 43:43.578
If this was your daughter, would you
be saying the same thing, Clancy?

43:48.500 --> 43:51.002
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

43:51.920 --> 43:53.504
(sighs)

43:55.758 --> 43:57.300
It's just...

44:00.387 --> 44:04.182
I know your...
I know your daughter died.

44:07.394 --> 44:10.355
But we all die someday,
don't we?

44:12.441 --> 44:13.983
So what is it...

44:15.319 --> 44:19.906
...that's so terrible
that you can't talk about?

44:22.201 --> 44:23.451
Okay!

44:24.828 --> 44:26.913
Here's what I'm not telling you.

44:27.081 --> 44:30.667
JOHN: You lost your virginity
to a drunk stud called Bruce

44:30.834 --> 44:33.336
in the back of his green
Ford Bronco at 17

44:33.504 --> 44:35.713
You didn't like it very much because

44:35.881 --> 44:37.340
he puked all over you.

44:37.508 --> 44:40.677
5 years ago,
you had a boyfriend called Kevin.

44:40.844 --> 44:42.387
No, sorry. Gavin.

44:42.554 --> 44:45.640
A year into that
relationship you discovered

44:45.808 --> 44:48.685
he thought
you were pregnant with his baby.

44:48.852 --> 44:52.188
Gavin didn't want it
but you did, so he left you.

44:52.356 --> 44:55.024
And 21/2 months later,
the baby was born.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.859
A little girl, Amanda.

44:57.027 --> 45:00.488
But one day you decided
to give her up for adoption.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.407
It's breaking your heart,

45:02.574 --> 45:07.829
tearing your guts out and that's why you
pretend to be so foul-mouthed and cool.

45:08.330 --> 45:12.917
Exactly twice a year on each of your
parents' birthdays, Doreen and Frank,

45:13.085 --> 45:15.712
On their birthdays,
11/16 and 10/23,

45:15.879 --> 45:17.714
you call them in Cincinnati

45:17.881 --> 45:22.260
and tell them you love them,
they reply "We love you too, honey bunny."

45:22.428 --> 45:26.973
And then you will cry your heart
out on that red goose down pillow.

45:27.141 --> 45:30.017
And you'll hate my guts
for telling you all this.

45:30.185 --> 45:33.896
But you know what, Agent Cowles?
Nobody gives a shit.

45:40.612 --> 45:42.155
You want me to go on?

45:42.906 --> 45:44.449
KATHERINE: Go ahead.

45:45.701 --> 45:47.368
What else do you see for me?

45:49.455 --> 45:52.331
- (gunshot)
- Just go home, Kathy.

45:54.209 --> 45:56.419
Just go home.

46:07.389 --> 46:09.474
(siren wailing)

46:35.626 --> 46:38.169
(sirens wail)

46:44.718 --> 46:46.385
COP 1: I've gotta search.

46:46.929 --> 46:50.056
(indistinct police patch over radio)

47:08.659 --> 47:10.576
Holy Mother of God.

47:20.420 --> 47:24.590
Unsub is male, between
the ages of 18 and 35.

47:24.758 --> 47:26.425
Mental illness likely.

47:27.845 --> 47:30.763
Look for a man with
little personal hygiene,

47:31.473 --> 47:35.184
someone conspicuously short
on social skills. A...

47:36.353 --> 47:40.189
...mercurial or
an artistic temperament.

47:41.733 --> 47:45.987
And for Christ's sakes find
the bottom half of that dress.

47:48.657 --> 47:52.577
Sexually motivated,
excessively violent.

47:54.037 --> 47:56.122
This isn't even close
to our guy.

48:45.422 --> 48:47.298
(distorted screaming)

48:47.466 --> 48:50.134
- (distorted singing)
- (birds chirping)

48:56.016 --> 48:57.642
(subway train speeding)

48:58.644 --> 49:00.186
MAN: Hey, cop!

49:01.688 --> 49:04.690
- JOHN'S VOICE: Joe.
- KATHERINE'S VOICE: John.

49:04.858 --> 49:06.192
(gunshot)

49:08.153 --> 49:09.695
JOE: John!

49:12.699 --> 49:14.450
Maybe you're right, John.

49:15.911 --> 49:18.663
Maybe we can't catch this guy.
Maybe...

49:18.830 --> 49:22.500
Maybe that's exactly what he wants.
We found a clue, John.

49:23.168 --> 49:26.212
And I think it's a good one.
I want you to see it.

49:27.547 --> 49:30.049
Call it a personal favor.

49:32.719 --> 49:35.972
You know, something really bad
is going to happen.

49:37.891 --> 49:42.687
JOE: Your mystery fax was sent over
the Internet by high anonymity proxy.

49:42.854 --> 49:44.522
We had trouble tracking it.

49:44.690 --> 49:48.776
We also did a chemical analysis
of Victoria Raymond's bathwater.

49:48.944 --> 49:52.697
HIV positive which we knew
from the autopsy and from you.

49:52.864 --> 49:56.659
But we found trace elements
of an anti-invertebrate toxin.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.703
Snail poison. On the flowers.

50:00.998 --> 50:03.958
John, I gotta ask.
Do you just know this weird crap

50:04.126 --> 50:06.794
or are you seeing into
my brain right now?

50:08.630 --> 50:11.090
- JOE: We're here.
- (sirens wailing)

50:11.466 --> 50:14.176
JOE: This is where
the flowers came from.

50:16.179 --> 50:17.722
Hey.

50:19.099 --> 50:22.476
I owe you an apology.
I'll explain later.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.730
- You okay?
- JOE: John.

50:25.897 --> 50:27.148
Yeah.

50:27.983 --> 50:29.525
JOHN: Yeah.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.236
Wow.

50:36.158 --> 50:37.992
We shouldn't be doing this.

50:38.410 --> 50:40.119
Over here!

50:42.247 --> 50:43.789
JOE: Too late now.

50:53.967 --> 50:56.093
They look clipped.
Not torn off.

50:57.429 --> 50:59.472
SLOMAN: I'll call forensics.

50:59.639 --> 51:01.348
- John?
- Uh-huh?

51:01.516 --> 51:03.517
- You up for this?
- Yeah, sure.

51:16.865 --> 51:19.658
(high-pitched tone)
(distortion)

51:41.681 --> 51:43.474
It's over there.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.605
KATHERINE:
The bottom half of the dress.

51:49.773 --> 51:51.023
Shit!

51:51.900 --> 51:54.193
Get Otis in from the 14th now!

51:54.653 --> 51:56.195
I'm on it.

51:57.572 --> 52:02.076
We found the top half of
the dress pasted to a wall in a tenement.

52:02.577 --> 52:07.414
At least half the victim's blood supply.
I was sure it wasn't our guy.

52:07.874 --> 52:09.625
Still doesn't feel right.

52:11.086 --> 52:13.963
- Otis is here.
- And Otis is who?

52:15.507 --> 52:17.049
JOE: Besides you,

52:17.801 --> 52:19.426
he's the best there is.

52:21.346 --> 52:23.806
Otis! Come on, boy. Let's go.

52:26.393 --> 52:28.853
- Where's the item?
- JOE: Right here.

52:29.855 --> 52:32.064
(sniffing)
(barking)

52:32.232 --> 52:34.733
WRANGLER: Let's go, boy.
Find it.

52:34.901 --> 52:36.902
Let's go! Move it up!
Let's go!

52:37.612 --> 52:42.324
KATHERINE: I want a 3-block perimeter.
We're on our way to Riverside.

52:42.492 --> 52:45.369
- How far do we follow him?
- As far as he goes.

52:45.537 --> 52:49.290
JOHN: I don't trust it.
Either this is useless or...

52:49.749 --> 52:52.668
he's leading us somewhere,
maybe into a trap.

52:52.836 --> 52:56.005
- John, should I not follow the lead?
- No.

52:56.173 --> 52:59.175
We have to follow him.
Christ, no! It's weird.

53:03.305 --> 53:04.305
WRANGLER: Let's go!

53:04.431 --> 53:07.892
Possible subject location.
Give me all units, now!

53:09.269 --> 53:12.313
- You wearing a vest?
- Of course. We all are, John.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.398
SLOMAN: Let's go! Move it up!

53:18.612 --> 53:22.656
JOE: 2 men on each exit, 6 going in.
Sawyer runs the perimeter.

53:22.824 --> 53:24.241
Let's go.

53:25.660 --> 53:27.203
JOE: Go!

53:31.082 --> 53:32.833
AGENT 1: Stairway up.

53:35.337 --> 53:36.837
AGENT 1: Landing. Clear.

53:37.422 --> 53:38.923
Stairway up.

53:40.383 --> 53:41.926
Landing. Clear.

53:43.595 --> 53:46.639
SLOMAN: Open door!
Closed door left.

53:46.806 --> 53:48.724
Hallway.
Closed door right.

53:50.060 --> 53:51.602
(barks)

53:51.770 --> 53:53.520
SLOMAN: Closed door left.

53:54.272 --> 53:55.898
Closed door right.

53:56.066 --> 53:57.441
Closed door right.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.655
FBI! Open up!

54:04.324 --> 54:05.366
Go.

54:07.077 --> 54:09.286
AGENT: FBI! FBI!

54:09.829 --> 54:11.622
Stay to your left!

54:12.874 --> 54:16.460
- AGENT 1: Left side clear.
- AGENT 2: Right side clear.

54:20.173 --> 54:21.715
Room clear!

54:24.552 --> 54:26.512
- Whoa!
- Do you live here, sir?

54:26.680 --> 54:29.139
- Do you live here?
- This is my studio.

54:29.307 --> 54:30.849
What's your name?

54:31.518 --> 54:33.143
Linus Harp.

54:33.311 --> 54:36.480
Do you know
who occupies the opposite studio?

54:36.648 --> 54:38.565
No... No one does.

54:38.733 --> 54:41.860
- Turpentine?
- I'm a painter.

54:44.572 --> 54:47.700
That's great. Can you
please step outside with us?

54:47.867 --> 54:49.618
Can I lock up first?

54:49.786 --> 54:52.579
No. Your studio is safe.
Step outside.

54:53.665 --> 54:55.207
Frogs.

54:55.375 --> 54:57.584
(chirping)

55:13.143 --> 55:14.226
(gunshot)

55:17.439 --> 55:19.023
(distorted gunfire)

55:20.358 --> 55:23.235
- KATHERINE: (distorted) Freeze!
- (gunshots)

55:25.363 --> 55:28.657
- Man down!
- SLOMAN: Move! Ambulance!

55:33.330 --> 55:35.205
AGENT: Agent down!

55:36.666 --> 55:38.250
AGENT: Suspect on foot!

55:38.793 --> 55:41.670
He jumped out the window!
I'm coming down!

55:41.838 --> 55:43.339
We gotta get him to county!

55:43.506 --> 55:45.549
- What?
- How's it look?

55:46.676 --> 55:49.011
It's not great.
Get an ambulance! Now!

55:49.512 --> 55:51.638
Go with Katherine.

55:51.806 --> 55:53.432
Come on and get him!

55:55.226 --> 55:58.479
- KATHERINE: (over radio) Got anything?
- No sign!

55:58.646 --> 56:00.606
We got anything? Anything?

56:01.024 --> 56:02.566
(gunshot)

56:11.242 --> 56:13.243
(tires screeching)

56:20.210 --> 56:22.378
- What am I looking for?
- No idea!

56:22.545 --> 56:24.254
- SLOMAN: White male...
- Left!

56:24.422 --> 56:26.006
- Left here?
- Left here.

56:26.174 --> 56:28.217
DISPATCHER:
Car heading west...

56:28.385 --> 56:31.387
- In pursuit.
- DISPATCHER: Give us a description.

56:31.554 --> 56:33.514
- Right!
- We will when we can.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.975
(tires screech)

56:39.562 --> 56:42.189
Yellow cab.
He's stolen a yellow cab.

56:43.149 --> 56:45.943
- (tires screeching)
- (horn honking)

56:48.905 --> 56:50.656
I need a number.

56:54.244 --> 56:58.080
- Five. M. Four. Three.
- There!

57:02.669 --> 57:04.002
(honking)

57:19.269 --> 57:20.686
MAN: Hey!

57:21.479 --> 57:23.021
WOMAN: Look out!

57:26.568 --> 57:28.110
We're gonna lose him!

57:30.989 --> 57:32.531
MAN: Hey!

57:33.241 --> 57:35.075
- Take a left.
- He went straight!

57:35.243 --> 57:36.785
Take a left!

57:41.958 --> 57:43.292
- Okay, stop!
- Sit back!

57:43.460 --> 57:45.169
- Stop the car!
- I got this!

57:45.336 --> 57:49.173
Stop the fucking car!
What's the matter with you?

57:49.924 --> 57:52.759
- He's gonna get away.
- Just stop the car.

57:53.219 --> 57:55.554
- You want me to let him go?
- Shut up!

57:58.600 --> 58:00.225
Come on! Come on!

58:05.106 --> 58:06.648
Right. Go!

58:14.949 --> 58:16.492
(honking)

58:33.760 --> 58:34.843
(screams)

58:51.027 --> 58:54.655
- You okay?
- Yeah. Are you?

58:55.114 --> 58:56.657
JOHN: Yeah.
(groans)

58:58.034 --> 58:59.576
Where is he?

59:01.955 --> 59:03.539
KATHERINE: Where is he?

59:18.304 --> 59:20.722
- LINUS: Hey, cop!
- (gunshot)

59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.597
(gunshots)

01:00:03.641 --> 01:00:05.684
(spluttering)
(coughing)

01:00:11.065 --> 01:00:14.401
- You're not him.
- (spluttering)

01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:18.196
(screams)

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.000
- You want a moment alone with him?
- Yeah.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:38.175
(monitor beeps steadily in background)

01:00:43.556 --> 01:00:45.474
(heavy breathing)

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:56.777
- JOE: Did you get the guy?
- No, Katherine did.

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:58.820
Good for her.

01:01:01.282 --> 01:01:03.158
It wasn't the guy, was it?

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:05.160
JOHN: Nope.

01:01:06.412 --> 01:01:07.954
So you were right.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.957
He was just leading us
down a path.

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:12.459
Mm-hmm.

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:16.254
Handing us that psychopath.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.008
And now...

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:24.054
Now he's got another
terminal case to show for it.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.973
Stage four cancer.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.685
You'd picked up on that,
hadn't you?

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:31.728
I figured.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:37.067
I appreciate you
not making me talk about it.

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:40.987
I got the diagnosis...

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:45.659
...a few months ago.
And...

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:48.870
It's too advanced
to do anything about it.

01:01:50.456 --> 01:01:51.998
You will...

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:56.169
You'll check on Laura
and my little man now and then?

01:01:56.337 --> 01:01:58.255
JOHN: Yes, of course, I will.

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.427
Hell, John!

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.722
I'm not ready to die.

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.099
I guess, uh...

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:15.731
You know, I'd been planning on it.
I've been expecting it for a little bit.

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:19.568
But not for a few more months.
You know, I...

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:21.820
I have so much stuff to do.

01:02:23.656 --> 01:02:26.491
I want to move Laura
to the country.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:29.953
I want to teach my little boy
to drive.

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:33.457
You were always
a lousy driver.

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.500
I know.

01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:39.963
I wanted him to
take after his dad.

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:47.053
(catches breath)
You know, we, uh...

01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:51.099
We want for so much in life,
you know?

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.770
And then we get it.

01:02:56.522 --> 01:02:58.023
I have it.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:01.526
But I've run out of time.
There's just no time left.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:06.490
Well, you did a hell of a lot
with your life and time.

01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:08.617
My friend.

01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:11.661
- Not enough, John.
- JOHN: You did.

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:13.955
No.

01:03:18.544 --> 01:03:20.921
It's good having you back,
you know?

01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:23.799
Hey.

01:03:24.258 --> 01:03:26.384
Tell me one of your
crappy jokes.

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:32.641
Crappy joke? How about I disconnect you?
Would that make you laugh?

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:36.102
It's true.
You really fucking can't.

01:03:42.276 --> 01:03:44.069
That smile right there.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:48.198
You do me a favor. You take that
to Elizabeth. Okay?

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:50.450
You make it up with her.

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:58.166
(sniffles)

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:00.836
(sobs)

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:13.431
I'm sorry I said to you
what I said last night.

01:04:17.478 --> 01:04:20.105
You wanted to tell me
something at the park.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.815
What was that?

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:24.693
Oh, yeah, I remember.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.238
Yes, it was a...

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:33.869
...beautiful Sunday afternoon.
June 24th 1990.

01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:37.664
I watched my daughter
playing in the garden.

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:40.125
Everyone singing
"Happy Birthday."

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.043
It was her sixth birthday.

01:04:42.461 --> 01:04:44.963
All the other kids had a great time.

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:47.424
Suddenly, there it was.
I saw it...

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:50.927
Standing just behind her,
behind Emma.

01:04:52.805 --> 01:04:54.264
It was a shadow.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:56.683
It was moving like a curtain.

01:04:57.935 --> 01:04:59.519
Moving in the breeze.

01:05:00.771 --> 01:05:05.150
I knew it was no trick of the light.
I could feel it all around me.

01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:07.861
Inside me.
(shudders) Oh, God.

01:05:09.822 --> 01:05:11.364
It was weird.

01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:15.493
And then it just sort of faded away.
And, uh...

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:20.832
I didn't tell anyone,
not even my wife Elizabeth, no one.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:23.501
But I had no doubt,
no doubt at all.

01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:29.716
And 20 years later,
to the exact day, she called us.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.844
Thursday morning, 9:23.

01:05:33.846 --> 01:05:36.556
I thought, "Okay,
This is it. Here we go."

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:38.391
Then came the diagnosis,

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.477
Leukemia,

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:45.148
followed by two years of
agonizing treatment.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:48.568
Then came the worst day
of my life when she...

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:50.987
...died.

01:05:51.822 --> 01:05:53.365
And she was gone.

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:56.284
Emma.

01:06:06.712 --> 01:06:10.131
PRIEST: And on the third day,
He arose from the dead,

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:12.842
In accordance
with the scriptures.

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:15.136
He ascended into heaven

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.264
and sits at the right hand
of the Father.

01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:21.518
He will come again in glory,

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.312
to judge the living and
the dead.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:28.525
And his kingdom
will have no end.

01:06:30.027 --> 01:06:31.403
Amen.

01:06:54.468 --> 01:06:56.011
Kevin, come here.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.056
I know, okay.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.525
(inaudible)

01:07:14.947 --> 01:07:16.489
(singing)

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.145
(gasping) (train whirring)
(gunshot)

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:57.155
- Hey.
- (laughter)

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:05.163
(music plays in bar)
♪ Your time is near

01:08:06.832 --> 01:08:10.085
WAITRESS: Anything else?
- I'll have the same again.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.844
STRANGER:
I wanted to meet you for so long.

01:08:20.011 --> 01:08:22.055
We're finally face-to-face.

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:25.850
Here you go.

01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:28.812
- Could I have another one of these?
- Sure.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:34.651
John, each life I take,

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:38.071
it's a life that's saved
from enormous pain.

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:42.742
I see what lies ahead for them.
The suffering and the sickness.

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:44.743
I see them writhing in agony.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:47.747
I hear them screaming,
begging for release.

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:50.625
They beg for it, John.

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:54.170
And I grant them their wish.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.171
Only better.

01:08:56.756 --> 01:08:59.384
I get there before
the wish is even made.

01:08:59.718 --> 01:09:02.345
I get there before
the pain even starts.

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:06.224
As for their loved ones,
there's always an autopsy

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:08.810
when the existing
condition is found.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:12.729
That's when I see them
go from shock to relief.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.859
STRANGER:
I hear them say things like,

01:09:16.026 --> 01:09:18.027
"Thank God it was so sudden."

01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:20.029
"At least she felt no pain."

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:24.033
In the end, they're grateful
for what I've done.

01:09:28.788 --> 01:09:31.707
That's why I helped
your friend Joe.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:37.796
He had 73 days
of horrific pain ahead.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:42.343
Do you know what benefits
his family would've gotten?

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:47.055
Dying of natural causes,
14 years into his career? None.

01:09:47.224 --> 01:09:51.519
Now his wife gets a pension,
putting their son through college.

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:53.897
Stanford, actually.

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:57.025
You think Joe wouldn't have
taken that deal?

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:02.322
Please don't call to them.

01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:04.699
Come on.
You know I have a gun on me.

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:11.581
- He's got a gun!
- PEOPLE (screaming): Gun! Get down!

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:15.585
(gunshots)

01:10:15.753 --> 01:10:17.629
MAN: Drop the gun!

01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:20.089
(gunshots)

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:25.053
I've seen all possible
outcomes of this meeting.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.889
I walk away healthy
from each one.

01:10:28.515 --> 01:10:31.226
One version's gruesome for our waitress

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:35.355
who'd be unlucky as her shift ends
in a couple of minutes.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:39.609
I don't enjoy the work I do.
John, it's not a fetish.

01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:44.113
It's about allowing those who are
already dying

01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:46.199
...to die with some dignity.

01:10:52.706 --> 01:10:57.126
Sometimes the greatest acts of love
are the hardest acts to commit.

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:09.305
Why are you giving me
the silent treatment?

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:14.811
I got it.
It's a lot to process.

01:11:23.195 --> 01:11:25.321
That wasn't supposed to happen.

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:29.784
To be continued.
(shouts) He's got a gun!

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.619
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:36.082
It's him for Christ's sake!
Leave me alone! Get him!

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:42.839
WAITRESS: Oh, he was drinking beer.
But it was non-alcoholic.

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:45.383
He had a scar on his forehead.

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:48.428
It was kind of jagged, like, scar.

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:53.933
Here are all unsolved
murders over the last 10 years

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:55.893
with terminally ill victims.

01:11:56.061 --> 01:11:58.938
- How many?
- 7. No punctures to the medulla,

01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:00.690
but all painless.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:03.318
- Poisons, gas.
- These are all local?

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:05.611
You want the national data, too?

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:16.914
CHARLES: Is this how you saw it?
What's Atticus?

01:12:17.082 --> 01:12:20.293
- KATHERINE: John?
- CHARLES: We're connected.

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:23.463
We're the same animal.
Does this look familiar?

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:25.381
EMMA: I'm scared.

01:12:25.549 --> 01:12:27.383
DAVID: Did she leave a note?

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.518
CHARLES: Concentrate, John.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.729
Focus, John.

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:43.608
KATHERINE: John!

01:12:50.574 --> 01:12:53.159
- LINUS: Hey, cop!
- EMMA: I'm scared.

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:02.168
CHARLES: Just... focus.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:07.715
Concentrate, John.

01:13:11.762 --> 01:13:13.137
Focus.

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:26.359
62 in the last 10 years,
ranging from Juneau to Miami Beach.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:28.069
Shit!

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:33.574
Do one more search.
Remove the terminal constraint.

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:36.911
Look for other unsolveds
in the same time period.

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:41.374
The killer may have known
they were sick when no one else did.

01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:45.002
Run everything
against this description:

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:49.924
Male, 30s, front-left cranial scar,
almost certainly post-surgical.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.843
Bring me everything...

01:13:52.302 --> 01:13:54.720
anything you come across. Okay?

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.515
(romantic music plays)

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:06.107
Hmm.

01:14:20.038 --> 01:14:24.250
OLDFIELD: That's what it means,
"Congratulations, partner."

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:25.960
I'm getting upped!

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:31.048
That's what 20 minutes
with a rich geriatric will get you.

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:38.598
Well, I'm the youngest partner
in the firm's history.

01:14:38.765 --> 01:14:40.850
You can tell your friends that.

01:14:45.772 --> 01:14:49.734
I don't know, I mean...
Bring me them on Monday?

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:52.487
OLDFIELD: Whatever they think is right.

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:55.114
CHARLES: How to keep. Is there any,

01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:56.824
is there none such

01:14:56.992 --> 01:15:00.995
bow or brooch or braid or brace,
latch or catch or key to keep,

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:04.707
keep it, beauty, beauty,
beauty from vanishing away.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:09.670
"O is there no frowning
of these ranked wrinkles deep down?

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:12.423
No waving off of these messengers...

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:15.801
Still messengers sad and
stealing messengers of grey.

01:15:15.969 --> 01:15:17.553
BOTH: No, there's none.

01:15:17.721 --> 01:15:20.515
Nor can you long be what
you now are, called fair.

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:23.100
Do what you may do,
do what you may.

01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:25.853
BOTH:
Wisdom is early to despair.

01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:29.273
So, be beginning..."

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:32.026
- Hello, John.
- Hello, Charles.

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:36.864
"Nothing can be done to keep at bay
age and age's evils, hoar hair,

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.867
ruck and wrinkle,
death's winding sheets,

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:43.621
tombs and worms
and tumbling to decay."

01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:46.207
(chuckles)

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:50.044
Anyway, you were right about me.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:53.005
- I was... What's the word?
- Conflicted.

01:15:53.173 --> 01:15:58.052
JOHN: I was conflicted about you.
Yeah. But not anymore. Oh, no.

01:15:58.595 --> 01:16:01.430
You had no right to take
one hour, one minute,

01:16:01.598 --> 01:16:07.103
not even one second of time
away from my friend, Joe Merriweather.

01:16:08.313 --> 01:16:12.692
I don't know if you've ever really known
anyone who was dying, Charles.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:16.988
Watched them struggling
on the edge of terror and horror

01:16:17.364 --> 01:16:20.157
as they try to hold on to life.
I don't know,

01:16:20.325 --> 01:16:25.705
but if you had, perhaps you would
have appreciated how time at the end is...

01:16:25.872 --> 01:16:27.873
...kind of precious, I guess.

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:32.837
At that point,
even the pain of life itself

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:37.174
may be quite beautiful.
You know what I mean?

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.469
Is that how
your daughter felt?

01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:42.763
CHARLES: That her...

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:48.144
- ...her pain was "beautiful?"
- Well, my friend,

01:16:48.312 --> 01:16:50.563
I'm afraid you won't find out.

01:16:55.235 --> 01:16:59.155
- Who the fuck are you guys?
- Sit down and shut up.

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:08.623
I don't see you pulling
that trigger.

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.333
Ditto.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:13.336
- This is not your style. It's not mercy.
- No?

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:18.132
A bullet to the head is better
than what he's got coming.

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:21.177
You see, Jeffrey here...

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:25.473
has a fight ahead of him
with neurofibromatosis.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:30.645
And that's gonna turn him into
a writhing, crooked beast.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:36.776
Tomorrow night, after some cocktails,
Jeffrey gets his girlfriend pregnant.

01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:40.237
And the real charm about NFB
is that it's hereditary.

01:17:40.405 --> 01:17:44.700
There's a 50 percent chance
the kid gets it, but I can tell you now:

01:17:45.619 --> 01:17:48.204
the kid... gets it.

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:53.876
- What's NFB?
- And you want to gift him that suffering?

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.170
Destroy three lives in one,

01:17:56.838 --> 01:18:00.299
all because of
some moral judgment?

01:18:01.259 --> 01:18:03.386
We can't play God.

01:18:03.553 --> 01:18:06.263
No. I have no interest
in playing God.

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:11.143
As far as His work is concerned,
I'm not impressed.

01:18:17.067 --> 01:18:19.902
- (sobbing)
- (shushing)

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:22.571
It's okay.

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:26.283
Look at you.
You're so confused.

01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:30.121
You don't even know
which one of us to shoot.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.582
You'll figure it out
soon enough.

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:37.795
Call an ambulance.
You've been poisoned.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:42.425
You need to get to hospital.
Throw up, vomit, whatever. Drink milk.

01:18:42.592 --> 01:18:44.135
Good luck.

01:18:46.638 --> 01:18:49.181
I think we got him.
Your search came back.

01:18:49.349 --> 01:18:53.769
I crossed him with the gun records.
Gun was bought by a Charles Ambrose.

01:18:53.937 --> 01:18:56.897
Oh, man.
Let's go.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.116
(elevator bell dings)

01:19:18.962 --> 01:19:20.504
(elevator bell dings)

01:19:37.689 --> 01:19:39.523
CHARLES: Concentrate, John.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.736
Someone dies tonight.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.324
Don't lose me now.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.923
SLOMAN: FBI! Open door right!
Open door left!

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:08.010
Move in!
Room, clear!

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:23.234
SLOMAN: What is this place?
No furniture? Nothing?

01:20:23.902 --> 01:20:25.444
SAWYER: Not a bad view.

01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:29.073
CHARLES: Listen!

01:20:30.033 --> 01:20:31.575
Katherine!

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:36.831
Who is Charles Ambrose?

01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:39.959
Who is he, really?

01:20:40.126 --> 01:20:44.255
SLOMAN: How the fuck's he doing this?
CHARLES: I know what they'll look for.

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:48.425
Dysfunctional childhood
that involved abuse and neglect.

01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:50.970
CHARLES: Later on...

01:20:51.137 --> 01:20:55.307
couldn't hold a job,
couldn't keep a relationship.

01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:58.602
- Wrong on all counts.
- What the...

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:09.572
CHARLES: Concentrate.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.246
Mom never left me.
Dad never beat me.

01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:21.959
You won't find any trace of violence
or antisocial behavior in my past.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.336
I'm not a radical.

01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:27.423
I have no interest
in fame or power.

01:21:29.759 --> 01:21:33.387
I'm simply a man
who could no longer look away.

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.725
Don't stop.

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:49.403
God knows I would prefer
to live the quiet life...

01:21:51.364 --> 01:21:54.116
...away from all that
I have become.

01:21:56.202 --> 01:21:59.038
But we don't always get
to choose what we are.

01:22:02.375 --> 01:22:03.584
There you go.

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:18.057
(distortion)

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:24.396
(monitor beeping steadily)

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:27.566
It hurts so bad.
(sobs)

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:30.069
I'm so scared.

01:22:31.154 --> 01:22:32.905
(Emma continues to sob)

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:48.045
Officer Pearce.
My name is Charles Ambrose.

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:53.634
Tell your supervisor you just met me.
It will do wonders for your career.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.762
Officer Pearce here.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:23:01.392
And now the savior...
needs to be saved.

01:23:01.559 --> 01:23:04.144
(phone rings)

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:08.941
(ringing continues)

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:12.653
Clancy doesn't want you
to respond, Agent Cowles.

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:14.947
- (ringing continues)
- Sloman.

01:23:15.907 --> 01:23:19.660
CHARLES: He doesn't want you
there when it happens. But you will.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.037
You'll respond.
You'll be there.

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:24.832
You can't help yourself.

01:23:26.042 --> 01:23:27.584
Hey.

01:23:27.752 --> 01:23:29.503
Hey, a beat cop

01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:33.549
just reported a Charles Ambrose
at Ashland Station.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:38.429
Where are you going?
Hey! Get back here.

01:23:39.139 --> 01:23:40.681
See you soon.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:50.065
(train approaching)

01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:56.613
(train whirring)

01:23:56.781 --> 01:23:58.657
(distortion)

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:47.414
(distortion)

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.008
(intercom chimes)

01:25:01.387 --> 01:25:03.097
And here you are.

01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:07.976
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:12.231
Just as I've seen it all those years.
You, me, this train.

01:25:12.398 --> 01:25:16.193
You've seen it, too, right?
You've heard it? Day after day?

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:18.445
(imitates train)

01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:24.618
Except something's not right.

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:27.955
(gunshot)
(passengers scream)

01:25:35.588 --> 01:25:37.506
(sirens wailing)

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:44.596
This is Agent Cowles. Our suspect
is headed into Ashland Station.

01:25:44.764 --> 01:25:50.519
We'll have the engineer stop the train
in a station up ahead where we'll set up.

01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:52.855
- Then what?
- We take him out.

01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:56.275
- I advise you to stay clear.
- I'm not staying clear.

01:25:56.442 --> 01:25:59.319
We have control. Stay clear.

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:02.614
Shit!

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:05.492
(tires screeching)

01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:08.287
We're connected.

01:26:09.205 --> 01:26:13.208
- The same animal.
- No, no. I'm not a killer.

01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:17.337
- We can talk about that in seven minutes.
- Seven minutes?

01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:20.883
That's when you kill someone.

01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:23.844
- Who might that be?
- Me.

01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:26.680
Move, Move!
Move in!

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:29.057
- Let's go!
- Move!

01:26:29.225 --> 01:26:30.726
Go!
Move!

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:35.022
Go!
Move! Move! Move!

01:26:37.317 --> 01:26:39.067
Train is five minutes out!

01:26:39.944 --> 01:26:42.112
Let's go! Move!

01:26:43.114 --> 01:26:44.698
I'm dying, John.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:47.284
I can't continue this work anymore.

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:50.329
That's why I need someone
to carry on for me.

01:26:50.788 --> 01:26:53.540
Someone who can see the pain.

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:56.335
The suffering. Sickness.

01:26:56.836 --> 01:27:00.839
There's another reason you have
to shoot me that you don't see.

01:27:01.007 --> 01:27:02.633
Concentrate!

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:06.470
(distortion)

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:08.096
- John.
- (gunshot)

01:27:08.264 --> 01:27:09.264
John.

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:11.767
There it is. Thank you.

01:27:12.435 --> 01:27:14.019
CHARLES: Agent Cowles.

01:27:14.687 --> 01:27:16.521
You've grown so fond of her.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.691
It's like having
your daughter back.

01:27:19.859 --> 01:27:22.194
I'm sorry.
You've lost me, Charles.

01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:26.156
She doesn't fit your profile.
Why would you kill her?

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:30.661
(chuckles) You're right.
I won't kill her. She's perfectly healthy.

01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:34.373
That's the beauty of it.
You're going to stop me first.

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:37.501
Yes.
With one bullet, right here.

01:27:39.003 --> 01:27:42.965
- And after that, there's no turning back.
- Sorry, my friend.

01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:45.342
The game stops here and now.

01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:49.972
I want 4 shooters, 3 low, 1 high!
Train is 60 seconds out.

01:27:50.139 --> 01:27:51.974
Let's go. Move!

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:55.811
KATHERINE: FBI!

01:27:55.979 --> 01:27:59.022
- OFFICER: Ma'am...
- FBI! Let me through!

01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:01.066
- (distortion)
- (honking)

01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:03.068
Look at me, John.

01:28:04.028 --> 01:28:05.696
Does this look familiar?

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.545
See now?

01:28:24.424 --> 01:28:26.466
All your visions
become real.

01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:34.182
CAPTAIN:
50 seconds to target.

01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:37.185
- Do you have a visual?
- Captain.

01:28:37.353 --> 01:28:39.146
- Do you have a shot?
- OFFICER: Affirmative.

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:42.441
She's going to make it
just in time.

01:28:45.361 --> 01:28:48.447
- Take the shot!
- (OVER RADIO) Take the shot!

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:50.741
Fuck! I lost him!

01:28:52.535 --> 01:28:54.661
- Take the shot!
- (screaming)

01:28:55.538 --> 01:28:59.583
- OFFICER: Target is locked.
- (distorted radio) (screaming)

01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:01.335
SWAT CAPTAIN: Let's go!

01:29:04.213 --> 01:29:06.340
Say hello to your destiny,
John.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:09.051
(shouting)

01:29:15.558 --> 01:29:16.933
- (gunshot)
- Fire!

01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:19.311
(gunfire)

01:29:19.645 --> 01:29:21.480
SWAT CAPTAIN: Hold! Hold!

01:29:31.407 --> 01:29:33.408
(shell-shock distortion)

01:29:34.952 --> 01:29:36.703
I told you you'd kill me.

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:39.289
- Clear to fire!
- (gunshot)

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:41.541
(gunshot)

01:30:03.147 --> 01:30:06.358
(gasping)

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:09.528
- John.
- You're okay.

01:30:11.781 --> 01:30:13.323
JOHN: You're okay.

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:30.882
(monitor beeping steadily)

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.102
- Oh, hi.
- (chuckles)

01:30:42.728 --> 01:30:43.770
Hey.

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:48.358
- How are you doing?
- I spoke to the chief surgeon.

01:30:48.526 --> 01:30:50.861
He said the surgery was a success.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:55.073
- Good.
- He said the bullet went clean through.

01:30:55.241 --> 01:30:56.783
(exhales)

01:30:57.869 --> 01:31:01.079
I was hoping you would
consider a reinstatement.

01:31:01.247 --> 01:31:04.040
As Joe said,
we'd make a hell of a team.

01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:05.876
Oh no, I want a quiet life.

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.836
Yeah.
(voice breaks)

01:31:11.048 --> 01:31:13.133
JOHN: Joe would be proud of you.

01:31:20.224 --> 01:31:23.059
(sniffs)
(sobs)

01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:28.482
JOHN: Don't cry.
You're a good kid.

01:31:32.778 --> 01:31:35.363
It was good
working with you, John.

01:31:37.074 --> 01:31:39.701
- I'll see you around.
- See you around.

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:43.038
- Take care of yourself.
- I will.

01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:48.001
Oh, yeah, um...

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:52.547
Nearly forgot. Could you
help me with this?

01:31:52.715 --> 01:31:54.382
See it gets to delivered.

01:31:59.722 --> 01:32:01.264
I got it.

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:07.145
Joe.

01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:31.795
Hello, Elizabeth.

01:32:32.463 --> 01:32:34.047
Hello, John.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.383
You look so beautiful.

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:42.639
I read your letter.
Several times.

01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.809
It's different
than the others.

01:32:45.977 --> 01:32:47.519
Which way?

01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:50.939
It's all about the past.

01:32:51.857 --> 01:32:53.400
Oh, yeah?

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:58.154
Yeah, I think of Emma.
Every single day.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.829
Come here.

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:10.750
- JOHN: It's okay.
- (she sobs)

01:33:23.222 --> 01:33:26.182
- (monitor beeping steadily)
- (sobbing)

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:29.144
EMMA: It hurts.

01:33:31.647 --> 01:33:33.440
I'm scared.

01:33:36.402 --> 01:33:38.612
I'm so scared.

01:33:45.828 --> 01:33:48.371
Oh, my...
It hurts.

01:34:03.763 --> 01:34:06.264
(monitor beeps rapidly)

01:34:08.059 --> 01:34:11.019
(monitor flat-lines)

01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:35.960
CHARLES: Sometimes
the greatest acts of love...

01:34:36.128 --> 01:34:38.421
...are the hardest acts
to commit.

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:48.390
JOHN: Let's walk, shall we?

01:34:49.892 --> 01:34:51.810
CHARLES: See you soon, John.
