Gimme back that money!

02:20.374 --> 02:21.842
Pow, pow, pow!

02:21.875 --> 02:23.377
I got you now!

02:25.446 --> 02:28.582
Pow, pow, yeah!

02:30.651 --> 02:34.555
Hey. What's up with the dolls, Beeman?

02:56.856 --> 02:58.067
Here you go.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.715
Hey, I got it right here, right here.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.686
They're waiting for us.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.457
<i>Yeah, you're not listening, okay?</i>

03:09.490 --> 03:11.259
<i>I don't know why you're not listening,</i>

03:11.292 --> 03:12.893
but you're not listening.

03:12.926 --> 03:16.564
I'm already down eight million
on oil today, okay,

03:16.597 --> 03:21.269
because some blogger says
China's going big on solar.

03:21.302 --> 03:24.672
<i>Will, this is a huge risk.
You're overexposed.</i>

03:24.705 --> 03:27.408
- It doesn't matter.
- <i>And over-leveraged.</i>

03:27.441 --> 03:31.011
Look, I don't care if it's still
decades away from saving the world.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.282
Just add another 150 points
to our position and do it fast

03:34.315 --> 03:36.517
before the rest of the street
sees a not so sunny light.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.919
- <i>Laura's on the line.</i>
- Yeah, thank you.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.554
Hey, hun.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.022
<i>Danny's in the principal's office.</i>

03:42.055 --> 03:45.459
- What?
- He's been hit again.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.295
Is he okay?

03:47.328 --> 03:50.831
<i>Yeah, he's okay,
but he really needs his dad.</i>

03:50.864 --> 03:53.301
I mean, right now?

03:53.334 --> 03:55.269
I've got a kidney removal in an hour.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.804
<i>There's no other doctor on call?</i>

03:56.837 --> 04:00.040
Bill's here, but I'd rather
not hit him up again.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.677
All right, yeah, I'll move
a few things around, okay?

04:03.711 --> 04:05.679
- <i>I'll go get him.</i>
- Great.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.649
- All right, thanks, hun.
- Yeah, all right, bye.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.055
Hey, did the meeting with
the Saudis get moved to today?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.958
Yes, 3:00 p.m.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.598
Get Laura back on the phone, please?

04:24.632 --> 04:25.999
<i>Got it.</i>

05:08.909 --> 05:11.712
Fourth time this year, Will.

06:09.670 --> 06:13.373
Will, what are you doing down there?

06:15.108 --> 06:17.811
We're taking a trip.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.714
Great, can you move my call
with GE to next week?

06:20.748 --> 06:22.550
<i>Yes, absolutely, got that taken care of.</i>

06:22.583 --> 06:24.618
- Perfect.
- <i>Have a good trip.</i>

06:24.652 --> 06:26.854
- See you Monday, then.
- <i>Bye.</i>

06:30.491 --> 06:32.493
You ready for this, kiddo?

06:37.665 --> 06:40.468
You know, my dad took me
on my first deer hunt

06:40.501 --> 06:41.869
when I was half your age.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.504
I don't know, Dad.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.173
Ah, come on, buddy,
you're gonna love it.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.842
The rush, the feeling of accomplishment.

06:48.876 --> 06:52.680
I told you, we're gonna do
everything the right way.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.715
One shot, no pain, no suffering.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.950
How do you know there's no suffering?

06:56.984 --> 07:01.555
When was the last time
you got shot with a rifle?

07:03.324 --> 07:05.526
Well, you get to see where I grew up.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.896
First ten years, anyway.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.198
And you'll get to see
Aunt Dottie for the first time

07:11.231 --> 07:13.467
since you were a baby.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.833
- All set?
- Yeah.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.674
Jesus.
Man, are you kidding me?

09:05.913 --> 09:09.216
Marvin Howell.
That's the chief of police, Danny.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.319
He was even a friend of
my dad's before his accident.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.790
Dated Aunt Dottie, too, back in the day.

09:20.628 --> 09:25.132
Let me see your license.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.638
Billy Beeman? That's you?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.105
Just Will now, sir.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.274
William, right?
Your name is William,

09:34.307 --> 09:36.844
but everybody calls you Billy?

09:36.877 --> 09:39.346
- You remember?
- I do remember, yes.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.314
Hey, this is my family,
this is Laura, my wife.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.618
- How do you do?
- My son back there, Danny.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.253
Hey, Danny, how you doing?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.495
He's a very smart kid.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.630
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about that close call.

09:56.664 --> 09:59.900
I, uh, I don't know,
I wasn't paying attention.

09:59.933 --> 10:04.705
I'm okay, you're okay, you're okay.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.339
What brings you home?

10:06.373 --> 10:09.409
Actually, we're going
for a weekend at Dottie's.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.344
Gonna show Danny where I'm from.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.780
Hm.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.214
Roughing it?

10:15.683 --> 10:17.243
Well, you're in for a treat, young man.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.286
This little town is truly a gem.

10:19.319 --> 10:23.223
You folks have yourself a nice visit.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.192
Hey, thank you.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.294
I'll only ask you for one favor.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.697
I want you to keep your eyes open, okay?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.831
We had a little trouble at the bank,
and I'm advising everybody

10:31.832 --> 10:34.401
to exercise caution till it's resolved.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.636
All right, will do.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.339
And...

10:39.372 --> 10:41.074
Drive carefully.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.110
Thank you, sir.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.300
All right, kiddo, come on.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.272
Who's hungry?

11:12.305 --> 11:14.842
The fridge is full, and
the place is all ready for you.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.245
Daniel, you come give
your great aunt a hug!

11:18.278 --> 11:19.713
Go on, give her a hug.

11:19.747 --> 11:23.751
There's my little man!

11:23.784 --> 11:27.320
God, it's been so long!

11:28.421 --> 11:31.224
- Laura, honey.
- Hi, Dottie.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.062
And there's my favorite nephew!

11:35.095 --> 11:41.034
- Only nephew.
- Oh, well, who's counting?

11:41.068 --> 11:44.237
You're not taking that thing
out tomorrow? Are you?

11:44.271 --> 11:47.440
- Yeah, why not?
- That thing's gonna get stuck

11:47.474 --> 11:50.177
before you can get started.
You take the Ridgeline.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.313
That'll handle anything up there.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.756
- <i>Hey, Marv, what's up?</i>
- How you doing?

12:40.561 --> 12:43.163
Do you have anything to tell me?

12:45.999 --> 12:48.035
For thousands of years,

12:48.068 --> 12:52.706
men have viewed hunting as something

12:52.740 --> 12:54.908
much more than just
a means of survival, Danny.

12:55.242 --> 13:00.280
Okay, it's... it's a test of
character and courage.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.951
I mean, the singular act

13:03.984 --> 13:06.887
of tracking another
living creature, Danny,

13:06.920 --> 13:11.224
and then possessing the will
and the skill to end its life.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.198
All right, maybe this'll help.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.603
Whoa, cool!

13:23.636 --> 13:27.975
This was your grandfather's rifle.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.579
He left it to me when he died.

13:32.612 --> 13:36.016
One day, when you're ready,
it'll be yours.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.418
Can I hold it?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.287
Of course, kiddo, that's why we're here.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.857
All right, but first,
there's some rules, okay?

13:43.891 --> 13:46.326
Well, there's three of 'em.

13:46.359 --> 13:50.931
Safety, safety, and safety, you got it?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.033
- Mm-hm.
- This is a dangerous weapon.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.302
I need you to promise me
you're gonna be extra careful.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.571
- I promise.
- I'm serious.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.074
- I am, too.
- All right, buddy.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.442
Let me show you how to hold it.

14:05.145 --> 14:09.950
Now, you grip it with your
left hand here, all right,

14:09.983 --> 14:11.518
and you get the butt of the rifle

14:11.551 --> 14:13.453
right into your shoulder,
just like that.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.189
That's how you brace yourself, okay?

14:16.223 --> 14:17.891
Now, the safety's on,

14:17.925 --> 14:19.513
but you never put your finger
on the trigger

14:19.515 --> 14:21.462
until you're ready to take
your shot, okay?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.430
All right.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.531
This, right here, this is
how you load the cartridge.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.201
It's called bolt action.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.503
- See that?
- Mm-hm.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.239
There we go.

14:42.382 --> 14:47.921
Now just imagine a huge
whitetail steps out of the brush.

14:47.955 --> 14:51.258
And I'm talking a 12-point, 275 pounds,

14:51.291 --> 14:53.326
a real prize animal.

14:53.360 --> 14:57.397
And you got a clear shot,
just for a second,

14:57.430 --> 15:01.168
so you line him up, you put
him dead in your cross hairs,

15:01.201 --> 15:05.505
take a deep breath,
steady your nerve, and then...

15:07.040 --> 15:08.208
Then what?

15:10.043 --> 15:13.613
Well, then you find out
what you're really made of.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.416
Wanna give it a try?

15:18.618 --> 15:20.253
- What do you say?
- Yeah.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.455
All right, let's do it. Here.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.442
Now that's a loaded weapon,
all right? Safety's still on.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.378
When you're ready.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.286
That's all right.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.288
First one's practice, come on.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.631
Dang it.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.366
It's okay, it's not easy.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.700
Try again.

16:12.205 --> 16:16.076
All right, Danny.
Just take your time, okay?

16:16.109 --> 16:19.479
Take your time, I want you to focus.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.082
Whoa-ho-ho!

16:22.115 --> 16:24.584
That's my boy!

16:24.617 --> 16:27.187
- Good job, buddy.
- Thanks.

16:27.220 --> 16:31.058
All right, let's try again
with your eyes open, okay?

16:31.091 --> 16:32.525
Dinner's ready!

16:33.826 --> 16:35.728
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Danny.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.798
You never point your gun
at another person, ever.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.035
- Safety, safety, safety.
- Good.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.404
- Let's go get something to eat.
- Okay.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.513
Come on, kiddo.

17:02.389 --> 17:07.294
- What's the matter?
- You know where I stand.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.696
Danny is who he is,
he doesn't need to change.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.700
Him getting bullied doesn't
make him weak or inferior.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.236
It's the problem with
the bully, not Danny.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.606
Laura, no one's trying
to change him, okay?

17:19.638 --> 17:22.775
But I mean, he's gotta learn
how to stand up for himself

17:22.809 --> 17:27.347
and not be pushed around.

17:27.380 --> 17:32.585
If you get out there, and he doesn't
wanna pull the trigger, don't make him.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.106
Hey, kiddo.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.808
Kiddo, time to wake up.

18:00.447 --> 18:06.186
- It's not even light out, yet.
- Early bird catches the buck.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.656
Come on.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.898
One of my best memories of
grandpa is hunting in these woods.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.285
Hey, check it out.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.586
Cool.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.831
Let's put your hood up.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.366
Oh, I got you!

19:26.399 --> 19:29.436
- I got you.
- Come on, Dad. Come on.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.472
Come on.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.708
Keep your hood up.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.819
What's that?

19:46.853 --> 19:49.589
Oh, that's a tree blind.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.925
Hunters build them so
they have a hidden vantage

19:52.959 --> 19:55.228
to gaze down their prey.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.864
You know, sometimes they'll
spend days up in one of those,

19:57.897 --> 19:59.566
waiting for just the right buck.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.334
That's not fair.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.239
Danny, fair's got nothin' to do with it.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.911
Now let's hold up here.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.920
Grab a sip.

20:44.944 --> 20:48.481
All right, we're not actually
that far from the car.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.350
There's a road right up
there that leads back

20:50.383 --> 20:52.785
once we bag our deer, all right?

20:52.819 --> 20:54.887
Come on, Dad,
we've been here all morning.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.056
We haven't seen a thing.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.625
Yeah, well we're not going anywhere.

20:58.658 --> 20:59.992
Patience, buddy.

21:09.369 --> 21:13.606
Dad. Dad, Dad.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.342
Look.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.951
Get down, get down, get down.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.726
All right.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.397
Chamber your round.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.572
All right, take a deep breath.

21:47.073 --> 21:50.443
And when you're ready, it's all you.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.451
Okay.

22:04.924 --> 22:05.992
It's all right.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.428
Here, give me that.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.400
He's probably the guy
from that ATV we saw.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.435
Keep walking.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.072
What's going on, Dad?

22:20.106 --> 22:22.709
It's fine, it's nothing, all right?

22:22.742 --> 22:24.877
Just stay here, one sec.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.391
I told you, it's in a safe place.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.945
Fuck you, that wasn't the arrangement.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.895
I know, but there was
this car at the drop.

22:42.929 --> 22:46.799
I swear, the guy inside
looked right at me.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.469
Looked, I panicked and
took off to stash the bag.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.404
Then where, where did
the fuck did you put it?

22:51.438 --> 22:56.809
Listen, shouldn't we sit on
this a week or two, anyway?

22:56.843 --> 22:59.479
What with all this heat on us now?

22:59.512 --> 23:03.616
You are one stupid motherfucker,
you know that?

23:03.650 --> 23:05.117
Fuck you.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.166
I should've known you'd steal it,
you fucking hillbilly.

23:20.199 --> 23:23.135
I didn't steal it, man,
the drop went bad.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.672
You want it today?

23:27.540 --> 23:29.942
I'll take you there.

23:29.976 --> 23:33.613
You just give me my cut,
and we're through.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.715
Just as we planned.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.850
Well that plan is long gone now.

23:37.884 --> 23:38.950
New plan is you got five seconds

23:38.951 --> 23:42.555
to tell me where the fuck that bag is.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.534
Yeah, I'll take you there.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.737
You're just gonna kill me anyway.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.818
Oopsie daisy.

24:11.851 --> 24:15.755
You're a stupid motherfucker,
you know that?

24:15.788 --> 24:18.457
Now nobody gets it.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.149
Danny, shh.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.719
Who's there?

24:49.288 --> 24:52.559
Huh? I know someone's there, come out!

24:52.592 --> 24:54.160
I said, come out!

24:55.595 --> 24:58.565
Shh, Danny, it's okay, all right?

24:58.598 --> 25:00.066
You hear?

25:07.306 --> 25:11.243
I know you're there, come out!
Come out!

25:50.917 --> 25:52.151
Dad!

25:52.819 --> 25:54.253
Danny!

25:54.286 --> 25:56.623
Stay there, Danny.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.220
Fuck me.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.789
<i>Dad!</i>

26:30.890 --> 26:32.158
Stay there!

26:32.959 --> 26:34.193
Dad, look!

26:37.097 --> 26:38.698
Look, he's alive!

26:53.112 --> 26:55.281
Danny, come here, now!

26:57.684 --> 27:00.987
Shit. Shit.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.190
Here, take this.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.194
- What are you doing?
- Taking him to mom.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.962
What about that thing
he threw over there?

27:09.996 --> 27:11.864
I saw where it went.

27:11.898 --> 27:14.667
This man's bleeding to death, come on!

27:14.701 --> 27:16.035
Should we go get it?

27:16.068 --> 27:18.404
Daniel, come on!

27:23.442 --> 27:24.911
Laura!

27:25.411 --> 27:26.813
Guys?

27:27.780 --> 27:29.782
Oh my God, what happened?

27:29.816 --> 27:32.952
He was shot.
Danny, go get some towels.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.322
- Who is he?
- Uh, I have no idea.

27:36.355 --> 27:40.159
He just appeared in the woods.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.829
Laura, you've gotta do something.
He's lost a ton of blood.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.030
Did you shoot him?

27:44.063 --> 27:46.298
- What, no!
- Did Danny?

27:46.332 --> 27:48.434
No, no, he was with
another guy, all right?

27:48.467 --> 27:50.870
They were arguing about something,

27:50.903 --> 27:52.971
and the other guy just
fucking shot him, point blank!

27:52.972 --> 27:54.073
Why?

27:54.106 --> 27:56.843
I don't know, all right?

27:56.876 --> 27:58.978
I think he owed him money or something.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.947
Um, where's the other guy now?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.987
Danny, go play some video games.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.290
Will, where is the other guy now?

28:12.224 --> 28:13.492
I killed him.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.494
You shot a man in front of our son?

28:15.527 --> 28:17.864
I had no choice, all right?
We'd witnessed what he'd done.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.921
He was gonna shoot us next,
it was self-defense.

28:19.923 --> 28:20.465
What are you...

28:20.466 --> 28:21.867
Hey, look, you weren't there, all right?

28:21.868 --> 28:24.203
I did what I had to do!

28:24.236 --> 28:27.740
Now can you please fucking
help this guy before he dies?!

28:31.944 --> 28:33.780
He needs a hospital.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.248
Yeah, well there's no time.
The nearest one's an hour away.

28:36.282 --> 28:39.118
- We'll call for an airlift.
- Laura, you know better than I do,

28:39.151 --> 28:41.087
this guy's running out
of time, all right?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.855
Do something.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.891
Hey, wake up!

28:45.291 --> 28:46.793
Wake up!

28:46.826 --> 28:49.428
There's bandages and gauze in my bag.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.330
All right.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.354
This is gonna hurt.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.391
He's all right.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.160
How are you doing?

29:55.594 --> 29:57.429
Yeah, all right.

29:57.463 --> 30:01.968
I'm gonna go up to Dottie's
and call him an ambulance.

30:02.001 --> 30:05.037
Hey, Laura. Just hold on
a second, would you?

30:05.071 --> 30:06.572
What?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.908
Listen, it's just right now,

30:08.941 --> 30:11.978
we're the only ones who know about this.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.411
Why don't we just wait
for this guy to wake up

30:13.412 --> 30:14.847
and tell us what happened?

30:14.881 --> 30:16.182
What are you so worried about?

30:16.215 --> 30:17.950
Hun, I mean, if it was
really self-defense,

30:17.984 --> 30:21.020
- it's not gonna be a problem...
- He was a cop.

30:21.053 --> 30:25.491
Laura, the guy I shot was a fucking cop.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.097
Shh.

31:49.175 --> 31:52.144
You let go of my son right now.

31:52.178 --> 31:55.447
I can't do that, mister.
I need him.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.049
What for?

31:57.083 --> 31:59.451
Put the gun down.

31:59.485 --> 32:02.121
Put the gun down!

32:02.154 --> 32:05.391
All right, all right, all right.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.699
He says he knows where my key landed.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.468
I need that key more
than you can understand.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.052
There's gonna be cops
all over that place

32:18.054 --> 32:20.207
any minute now, so I gotta get there.

32:20.239 --> 32:23.509
All right, all right, all right.
Why don't you take me instead?

32:23.542 --> 32:25.577
Okay, I saw where it landed, too.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.713
I mean, come on, he's just a kid.

32:27.746 --> 32:32.084
You don't expect him to
remember the exact spot, do you?

32:32.118 --> 32:34.220
I'll take my chances.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.624
All right, then we all go.

32:44.596 --> 32:45.964
Dottie!

32:49.135 --> 32:51.670
It's okay, buddy.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.373
Just hop in the back seat, okay?

32:58.444 --> 33:00.346
Buckle up, kiddo.

33:00.379 --> 33:01.547
Okay.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.218
Giddyup, city boy.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.397
Will!

33:21.400 --> 33:25.304
- You all right, Danny?
- Yeah, I'm okay, Dad.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.010
Know where you're going?

33:33.212 --> 33:34.513
Yeah.

33:36.615 --> 33:39.385
You wanna tell me
what happened back there?

33:43.089 --> 33:45.524
You seem like nice people.

33:45.557 --> 33:49.095
I hope you get back to
that cabin before the cops do.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.730
If so, I suggest you head home.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.315
Why don't you let my son stay here?

34:10.349 --> 34:13.351
I think he's been through
enough for one day.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.692
Come on, man.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.362
I don't need him seeing that body again.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.137
Thank you.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.440
All right, buddy,
you're gonna stay here.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.210
I'll be right back, okay?
Just keep the doors locked,

34:38.244 --> 34:42.414
and if you see anything,
honk as loud as you can, okay?

34:42.447 --> 34:44.183
All right.

34:48.853 --> 34:52.491
Can't have you trying to run off, now.

35:20.719 --> 35:23.222
It's just up here.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.257
Take me right there.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.596
Freeze!

35:38.670 --> 35:40.239
Stechel.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.910
Don't do this.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.181
- Don't do it.
- Get me that key.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.317
Please, don't do it.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.490
Ah, fuck!

36:02.561 --> 36:04.930
Find the help wanted
notice board outside Earl's.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.832
Meet me there.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.235
Meet me there!

36:09.268 --> 36:12.204
Ah.

36:22.648 --> 36:23.849
Ah!

36:24.916 --> 36:27.619
Damn it, my son's in there!

36:32.391 --> 36:35.327
Dad! Dad!

36:35.361 --> 36:36.828
Buckle up.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.639
Fuck!

37:47.633 --> 37:49.835
Get down and stay down!

38:05.083 --> 38:06.785
Stop that.

38:06.818 --> 38:09.388
We're just gonna play a game.

38:09.421 --> 38:11.557
It's called Dukes of Hazard.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.360
Shit.

38:48.394 --> 38:51.363
Don't shoot! Hey!

38:51.397 --> 38:55.033
- Please stop!
- Get down, and stay down!

39:09.448 --> 39:10.782
Dad!

39:35.874 --> 39:37.876
Don't fuckin' move!

39:41.513 --> 39:43.682
My son is in that car.

39:45.617 --> 39:49.655
Was there another officer
out here with that man?

39:52.924 --> 39:56.094
Yeah. He's dead.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.436
Shh.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.172
I'm sorry.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.942
Danny.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.804
Goddamn shame.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.842
Laura, come here.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.900
Have you talked to anyone about
what happened this morning?

41:23.915 --> 41:26.217
No, Dottie wasn't home, I couldn't call.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.754
You sure? What about the cop
who drove you here.

41:28.787 --> 41:31.723
- What'd you tell him?
- Nothing.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.928
Nobody else saw this?

41:36.962 --> 41:41.099
Nobody else heard this,
nobody heard any fuckin' gunshot?

41:44.770 --> 41:48.006
All right, listen.

41:48.039 --> 41:51.810
Danny and I never came back
to the cabin this morning, got it?

41:51.843 --> 41:54.846
- Okay.
- We went out for our hunt...

41:54.880 --> 41:57.916
We went out for our hunt, and
this is the first you've seen me since.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.985
You don't know anything
about anyone getting shot

42:00.018 --> 42:02.053
or stitching up any wounds
or anything, okay?

42:02.087 --> 42:04.990
- What are you talking about?
- I can get Danny back.

42:05.023 --> 42:08.694
- How?
- He offered me an exchange.

42:08.727 --> 42:12.230
- What, like ransom?
- Before he was shot.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.265
The guy through a key into a bush.

42:14.299 --> 42:16.868
If I get it for him, Danny goes free.

42:16.902 --> 42:18.770
- Then do it!
- I'm going to,

42:18.804 --> 42:21.773
but it means not a word to
the cops until Danny's safe, okay?

42:21.807 --> 42:24.976
Just get him back.

42:28.146 --> 42:29.681
Will Beeman?

42:30.716 --> 42:32.918
Twice in two days?

42:32.951 --> 42:34.786
You wanna tell me what's going on here?

42:34.820 --> 42:39.090
Yeah, um, I was out
taking my son for a hunt

42:39.124 --> 42:41.159
when two men appeared out of nowhere.

42:41.192 --> 42:43.895
The first guy caught me by surprise,
grabbed my Remington.

42:43.929 --> 42:48.199
Levi Barrett is his name.
You've never seen him before?

42:50.168 --> 42:53.104
He say or give anything to you?

42:53.805 --> 42:55.273
Like what?

42:58.009 --> 43:01.079
The Remington isn't your
pop's old shooter, is it?

43:02.781 --> 43:05.851
So Levi snatches your stick
and turns on my officer.

43:06.985 --> 43:09.755
Yeah, they both fired at the same time.

43:09.788 --> 43:12.157
Officer Stechel got off a few rounds,

43:12.190 --> 43:14.760
couple went into the side
of that barn over there.

43:14.793 --> 43:16.795
How long was this before Richie arrived?

43:16.828 --> 43:20.231
I don't know, maybe five minutes?

43:20.265 --> 43:23.168
He says the boy was already
in the vehicle when he got here.

43:23.201 --> 43:25.070
Doesn't make sense.

43:26.705 --> 43:29.808
Yeah, well, uh, after Levi was shot,

43:29.841 --> 43:32.321
he was in pretty rough shape,
so he went over there to sit down

43:32.343 --> 43:36.347
and collect himself, and I sent Danny
up to the car to get a first aid kit,

43:36.381 --> 43:39.818
and that's what he was doing
when Officer Richie arrived.

43:42.821 --> 43:46.725
This is Officer Tom Davies.
One of my best and brightest.

43:46.758 --> 43:50.128
He'll take care of anything you
need until you find your son.

43:52.030 --> 43:53.398
All right.

43:58.937 --> 44:01.239
How long did it take you
to walk up that ridge?

44:01.272 --> 44:02.841
A few minutes.

44:02.874 --> 44:05.944
You hear any shots on the way up?

44:08.880 --> 44:11.382
Something doesn't feel right.

44:11.416 --> 44:12.783
You think he's working with Levi...

44:12.784 --> 44:14.385
I think he's lying, is what I think,

44:14.419 --> 44:17.355
and if he is, I can't figure out why.

44:17.388 --> 44:21.760
You stay on him, I'll handle Levi.

44:24.896 --> 44:27.866
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.

44:27.899 --> 44:30.001
That's what all kidnappers say.

44:30.035 --> 44:32.938
How would you know?

44:32.971 --> 44:35.741
Because I watch TV.

44:35.774 --> 44:37.776
How old are you?

44:37.809 --> 44:39.177
Eleven.

44:39.210 --> 44:41.046
Where are you taking me?

44:41.079 --> 44:43.414
I'm not taking you anywhere.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.316
I'm just trying to stay alive.

44:45.350 --> 44:48.119
Why do you need me?

44:48.153 --> 44:51.089
I made a deal with your dad
to get me my key.

44:51.122 --> 44:56.394
If I let you go,
he's got no reason to do it.

44:56.427 --> 44:58.930
What if he doesn't bring it?

44:58.964 --> 45:01.032
He will.

45:01.066 --> 45:03.869
Yeah, but what if he doesn't?

45:05.203 --> 45:07.973
Haven't thought that far ahead yet.

45:09.207 --> 45:12.710
That's when you start hurting me.

45:15.346 --> 45:17.916
Why'd that cop shoot you?

45:19.785 --> 45:23.288
Uh, it's grown up stuff.

45:23.321 --> 45:25.123
Like making babies?

45:25.156 --> 45:30.495
Yeah. Like making babies.

45:46.011 --> 45:47.178
What are we doing?

45:47.212 --> 45:50.148
Here? Walk.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.903
You better be right about all this.

46:11.937 --> 46:15.206
What'd you want me to do,
tell 'em I killed a cop?

46:18.443 --> 46:21.346
Look, as soon as it's dark out,

46:21.379 --> 46:25.817
I'm gonna go get that key
and find Levi, okay?

46:25.851 --> 46:27.518
He's just a boy, Will.

46:32.523 --> 46:35.460
He's a smart kid, all right?
He's gonna be fine.

46:37.128 --> 46:40.165
I'm gonna make it fine, I promise.

47:03.121 --> 47:05.957
Got a favorite game on that thing?

47:05.991 --> 47:10.528
- Yeah, I got a lot of games.
- What's your favorite?

47:10.561 --> 47:12.097
I don't know.

47:13.664 --> 47:17.235
Well, I got some cool games
where we're going.

47:17.268 --> 47:19.270
Killer Instinct's still my favorite.

47:19.304 --> 47:22.607
My parents don't let me play that.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.877
Ah. More grown up stuff.

47:27.212 --> 47:30.916
Killer Instinct's one
to look forward to.

47:30.949 --> 47:33.251
It's got some crazy shit.

47:34.920 --> 47:39.190
Sorry. Gotta watch my tongue.

47:39.224 --> 47:42.493
- Did it hurt?
- What?

47:42.527 --> 47:45.330
- Getting shot?
- Ooh, wee.

47:45.363 --> 47:48.433
Like a motherfucker. Oh.

47:50.635 --> 47:54.605
Sugar snaps, I, uh, did it again.

48:07.418 --> 48:10.155
There you are!

48:10.188 --> 48:13.158
- Who the hell is this?
- It's Danny.

48:13.191 --> 48:15.593
And you're supposed to be
watching the TV, keeping tabs.

48:15.626 --> 48:19.064
- I just checked, nothing new.
- You sure?

48:19.097 --> 48:22.100
After what I've been through today,
I thought Anderson Cooper'd

48:22.133 --> 48:23.969
be checked in to the Beaumont by now.

48:24.002 --> 48:25.536
Jesus.

48:25.570 --> 48:28.906
His ma's the one who fixed me up.

48:29.707 --> 48:31.542
I gotta go pee.

48:31.576 --> 48:34.679
Oh, be my guest, right through there.

48:40.518 --> 48:43.054
Just don't scare the kid.

49:09.180 --> 49:10.314
<i>Still no suspects in Thursday night's...</i>

49:10.315 --> 49:12.483
<i>...Granville First National heist.</i>

49:12.517 --> 49:15.753
<i>Police say they vow to return
all 2.3 million to the bank,</i>

49:15.786 --> 49:18.389
<i>despite it being federally insured.</i>

49:18.423 --> 49:20.725
<i>Bailouts are not the Granville way,</i>

49:20.758 --> 49:24.195
<i>stressed police chief, Marvin Howell.</i>

49:39.144 --> 49:41.379
<i>No, I ain't nobody's taxi to no place.</i>

49:41.412 --> 49:43.681
<i>But he can't stay here the night,
they're gonna find us.</i>

49:43.714 --> 49:46.317
<i>We have to stay here
until I get the key.</i>

49:46.351 --> 49:49.654
<i>Just trust me, I know what I'm doing.</i>

49:54.492 --> 49:56.661
You fall in?

49:59.230 --> 50:02.233
Danny, you come on out now.

50:07.505 --> 50:09.140
Danny!

50:11.776 --> 50:13.644
There you are.

50:13.678 --> 50:16.614
I though you might've try
to slither down the drain.

50:19.450 --> 50:22.753
Oh, uh, that's Adele's mom.

50:22.787 --> 50:24.655
Say hi, Mabel.

50:28.793 --> 50:31.429
What's wrong with her?

50:31.462 --> 50:32.797
What isn't wrong with her?

50:32.830 --> 50:36.567
Diabetes, onset chronic renal failure,

50:36.601 --> 50:38.703
80-pound tumor in her gut.

50:38.736 --> 50:43.241
Eighty pounds?
That's more than I weigh.

50:43.274 --> 50:47.112
Even with health insurance,
she can't afford proper treatment.

50:47.145 --> 50:50.215
All right, yeah, uh, come on.

50:50.248 --> 50:53.318
I'll show you them games
I was talking about.

50:57.888 --> 51:01.826
Daryl, yeah, it's Levi.
Yeah, right, I need a favor.

51:01.859 --> 51:06.264
Uh, you know that help wanted
notice board outside Earl's?

51:06.297 --> 51:08.499
Yeah, that's the one.

51:08.533 --> 51:10.468
Now write this down.

51:11.869 --> 51:13.404
All right, I think it's dark enough.

51:13.438 --> 51:14.705
I'm gonna head off.

51:14.739 --> 51:17.308
Please just bring him home.

51:17.342 --> 51:18.743
I will.

51:20.578 --> 51:27.585
And, Will, if you do encounter Howell,
just... be careful.

51:28.553 --> 51:30.121
This heist is the biggest crime

51:30.155 --> 51:31.556
to hit Granville in decades,

51:31.589 --> 51:35.360
and he's gonna solve it
one way or the other.

51:36.427 --> 51:37.728
Take the jeep.

51:39.530 --> 51:40.898
Thanks, Dottie.

53:07.318 --> 53:08.653
Officer.

53:08.686 --> 53:12.623
- Give me the key.
- What key?

53:15.025 --> 53:16.861
Oh, yeah that key.

53:18.429 --> 53:19.797
Okay.

53:24.335 --> 53:25.436
Here you go.

54:20.057 --> 54:22.627
What the... what the fuck?

54:28.599 --> 54:30.435
Beeman.

54:30.468 --> 54:32.937
You're fuckin' dead, Beeman!

54:36.040 --> 54:38.809
You're having bad luck
with keys tonight.

54:38.843 --> 54:41.011
Fuckin' dead, Beeman!

54:43.948 --> 54:46.417
Beeman! Beeman!

54:46.451 --> 54:47.752
I swear to...

54:50.721 --> 54:52.523
How'd you even do that?

54:52.557 --> 54:53.958
Those are good.

54:56.361 --> 54:59.430
Ah... sugar snaps.

55:00.931 --> 55:04.502
Yes.

55:05.803 --> 55:07.372
I knew you'd like it.

55:07.405 --> 55:08.806
Just don't tell my dad, okay?

55:08.839 --> 55:11.308
It's our secret.

55:14.011 --> 55:16.847
Why'd you rob that bank anyway?

55:18.115 --> 55:20.485
Same reason anybody does.

55:21.151 --> 55:23.854
Money.

55:23.888 --> 55:27.458
I figured my cut'd be enough
to cover Mabel's medical care,

55:27.492 --> 55:30.127
till I could put a ring
on Adele's finger.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.431
Mabel's all the family she's got.

55:33.464 --> 55:36.967
She matters to Adele, she matters to me.

55:38.168 --> 55:41.839
So, what went wrong with the robbery?

55:43.941 --> 55:45.876
It was wrong from the start.

55:45.910 --> 55:48.913
Should've known I was there
only to take the fall.

55:48.946 --> 55:50.781
They told me all I had to do

55:50.815 --> 55:53.751
was crawl through that tunnel
they dug and fill the bag.

55:53.784 --> 55:55.920
Everything else was already square.

55:55.953 --> 56:00.090
The alarm, security camera, loot itself.

56:00.124 --> 56:02.158
See, there was this armored truck
rolls through town

56:02.159 --> 56:05.563
every other Thursday
carrying over $2 million.

56:05.596 --> 56:07.898
Feeding the town, two weeks at a time.

56:07.932 --> 56:10.034
Been that way 50 years.

56:12.703 --> 56:15.973
So, you got caught?

56:17.174 --> 56:20.077
I got out of the bank just fine,

56:20.110 --> 56:23.948
but when I drove to the old
feeder mine to make the drop,

56:23.981 --> 56:26.517
there was this car in the lot.

56:26.551 --> 56:28.185
Place has been closed near 10 years.

56:28.218 --> 56:30.154
Should've been empty.

56:30.187 --> 56:31.889
It was probably just some driver

56:31.922 --> 56:35.860
trying to catch some shut eye,
but he spooked me good.

56:35.893 --> 56:38.796
I bolted.

56:38.829 --> 56:41.532
Probably the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

56:41.566 --> 56:44.769
'Cause now I know them
Stechels would've killed me

56:44.802 --> 56:46.904
the second I gave up that bag.

56:52.743 --> 56:54.545
Here, don't worry about that.

56:54.579 --> 56:57.114
Rematch.

57:44.061 --> 57:46.030
Place has been tossed, sir.

57:46.063 --> 57:48.533
Yeah, probably by Charlie.

57:48.566 --> 57:50.901
The girlfriend's place is empty, too?

57:50.935 --> 57:53.203
<i>No one's seen Adele since Thursday.</i>

57:53.237 --> 57:56.707
Does Levi have any family
or friends we can question?

57:56.741 --> 57:58.676
Man likes his solitude.

57:58.709 --> 58:01.045
What else I don't get is
why he took the boy.

58:01.078 --> 58:03.881
He's already got the money, right?
Why take a hostage?

58:03.914 --> 58:06.884
Are you telling me there isn't
one usable piece of evidence

58:06.917 --> 58:08.653
in that entire apartment?

58:08.686 --> 58:12.890
Not unless Levi's got some cancer
we don't know about.

58:12.923 --> 58:17.027
There's a whole stack of
tumor removal pamphlets here.

58:18.295 --> 58:19.930
Cancer?

58:22.032 --> 58:23.834
Chief Howell, line one.

58:26.103 --> 58:28.072
Marvin, how can I help you?

58:28.105 --> 58:30.841
Listen, do you have a patient
named Levi Barrett

58:30.875 --> 58:33.811
on any tumor patient lists over there?

58:33.844 --> 58:36.013
<i>Now, you know I'm not
allowed to tell you that.</i>

58:36.046 --> 58:40.184
Laverne, it's off the record,
just like always.

58:40.217 --> 58:43.153
<i>Nope, no Levi Barrett anywhere.</i>

58:43.187 --> 58:47.224
- What about Adele Fantion?
- <i>No Adele Fantion either.</i>

58:47.257 --> 58:50.227
Oh, wait. We got a Mabel Fantion.

58:50.260 --> 58:54.164
Her primary contact is daughter,
Adele Fantion.

59:21.191 --> 59:22.727
Anybody home?

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.096
Drop that gun now.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:39.837
On the floor, now!

01:00:44.709 --> 01:00:47.111
The hell are you doing here?

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:50.647
I was just trying to find my son.

01:00:54.018 --> 01:00:55.986
You're here alone?

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:59.790
Who else would I bring?

01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:02.159
Didn't I tell you to wait for my call?

01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:04.028
You think I'm not doing my job?

01:01:04.061 --> 01:01:06.697
No, no, no, that's not what I...

01:01:06.731 --> 01:01:10.400
How did you know to come here anyway?

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:14.739
Uh, you know, just asking
around town about Levi.

01:01:15.372 --> 01:01:18.442
Really? Asking around?

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:22.379
Like some sort of door-to-door canvass?

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:25.415
And what exactly were you
planning to do when you got here?

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:29.053
Politely request that Levi
just give you your son back?

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:31.756
Or maybe you're gonna shoot him first?

01:01:33.958 --> 01:01:36.093
Unless you got something else to trade.

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:41.932
That's what's going on here?
You have something Levi wants?

01:01:41.966 --> 01:01:44.168
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:50.775
Just like your dad.
I see that now.

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:54.979
So I want you to hear me
loud and clear, Billy.

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:59.249
Just let me do my job, and
this ends well for everyone.

01:02:07.992 --> 01:02:10.127
What's wrong with her?

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.862
The biggest thing wrong
with her right now

01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:15.399
is how unhelpful that she's being.

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:19.236
What?

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:24.008
One more time a little louder, hun.

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:26.510
Thirsty.

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:30.014
Thirsty.

01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:33.417
She's thirsty.

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:37.354
Well.

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:40.524
Why didn't you say so?

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:43.327
I'll get you some water.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.295
Jesus Christ.

01:02:50.367 --> 01:02:54.504
- <i>Chief Howell? Peterson, here.</i>
- What is it, Peterson?

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:57.041
<i>It's about Will Beeman, sir.</i>

01:02:57.074 --> 01:03:00.544
<i>We think he's lying about
the shooting this morning.</i>

01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:03.213
Go to secure channel four.

01:03:21.065 --> 01:03:23.800
Do you know where my son is?

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:40.550
<i>We found the two shell casings
from Charlie's side on 'em.</i>

01:03:40.584 --> 01:03:43.087
<i>But one was no where near the other.</i>

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.422
<i>We think Charlie shot
Levi out in a clearing,</i>

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:47.858
<i>then walked over to
the barn and fired again.</i>

01:03:47.892 --> 01:03:50.895
Making it unlikely that
Levi fired that rifle?

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:52.930
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:58.435
Good work, officer.

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:24.361
Here you go, one glass of
Granville lager at your service.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:29.866
Where'd he go?

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:33.971
Where did he go?!

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:40.911
It's just up here.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:46.050
- I lost my iPod.
- What?

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:50.220
I think it fell out
of my pocket back there.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:55.459
That's all right,
I'm sure your mom and pop

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:59.096
- will swing for a new one.
- I want my mom and dad.

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:03.367
You'll get them real soon,
buddy, I promise.

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:05.970
Here.

01:05:08.038 --> 01:05:10.340
I barely knew your dad,

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:13.410
but what he did to Charlie this morning,

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:15.345
that's not easy to do.

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:19.283
And he did it to protect you.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:23.420
You think he can't handle
finding you out in the woods?

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:28.025
Now, as soon as he gets here,
this'll all be over.

01:05:28.993 --> 01:05:30.327
It'll just be some cool story

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.130
you can tell your friends
back at school.

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:36.633
I don't really have many friends.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:40.304
Aw. Then it will just be some cool story

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:43.974
you can use to help you make some.

01:05:44.008 --> 01:05:45.342
Believe me.

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:51.048
Hey, who wouldn't wanna be friends

01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:53.083
with a tough kid like you?

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:01.591
And, uh, look.

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:04.461
There's my bunker.

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:07.264
Where?

01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:10.634
Exactly.

01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:33.390
Oh, here, sit down, Danny.

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:01.351
Fuck!

01:07:45.462 --> 01:07:48.232
Drop that bag!

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:49.599
Are you kidding me?

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:53.837
Drop that bag.
You're under arrest.

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:56.806
Oh, yeah, what for?

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.276
For murdering an officer of the law.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:02.446
And aiding a bank heist, you idiot!

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:05.882
Aw, man, you got this all wrong.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.418
All right, I know this
doesn't look good,

01:08:08.452 --> 01:08:11.655
but I can explain, all right?

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.290
Yeah.

01:08:14.558 --> 01:08:17.727
All right, it's true.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:20.897
I killed Charlie Stechel.
It was self-defense.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.899
I was just trying to protect my son.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:27.837
We saw him shoot Levi without
provocation, all right?

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:30.674
And then he turned on me and Danny,
he was gonna kill us!

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:32.341
And I'm pretty sure
that Charlie and Richie

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:33.777
did the bank job with Levi.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:35.812
Shut up. Highly unlikely, Billy.

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:38.648
The Stechel brothers are
two of my finest officers.

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:40.265
Yeah, well, there's
no other explanation for

01:08:40.267 --> 01:08:41.884
why they were all out
in the woods like that.

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:47.191
Yes, I'll be sure to look into
it as soon as this is all over.

01:08:47.224 --> 01:08:50.359
What is this?
This looks like a rendezvous map.

01:08:50.394 --> 01:08:52.395
No, it's not like that, all right?

01:08:52.429 --> 01:08:57.334
Look, Levi told me to come here,
and to get the money for him,

01:08:57.367 --> 01:09:00.170
and... and... and he insist
that I not tell the cops,

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.206
- what was I supposed to do?
- Tell the cops!

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.165
Come on, man.

01:09:03.167 --> 01:09:05.343
Why would you even attempt
something like this?

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:07.310
I didn't attempt anything, all right?

01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:09.011
I'm just trying to get
my son back alive.

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:11.314
What is it? You need a new rush?

01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:16.520
You're not listening.
Levi Barrett took my son

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:20.189
because his accomplices,
your fucking officers,

01:09:20.224 --> 01:09:21.858
were gonna kill him.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:23.426
All right, now I'm begging you,

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.261
that money is the only way
to get Danny back.

01:09:25.295 --> 01:09:27.631
Why don't you just pay him
out of your own pocket?

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:31.268
Because that's not what he asked for,
this isn't a normal ransom situation.

01:09:31.301 --> 01:09:34.537
Of course not, you'd rather
give him other people's money.

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:38.808
Just let me take this money
and go get my kid.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:41.511
Please. And then once he's safe,

01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:43.712
you can do whatever you want
with Levi Barrett.

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:47.551
Hey, hey, hey!
You do not call the shots.

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:12.376
You ready to get your son?

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:16.446
You're not taking me in?

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.616
Levi's expecting you this morning.

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:22.486
The longer we wait,
the more suspicious he becomes.

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:23.952
He'll think either you're not coming,

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.523
or you went to the police.

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:30.594
You're just gonna do
this alone, no back up?

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:34.364
I got you and the money.
What else do I need?

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:42.939
Let's go.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:48.372
I don't blame you for not grabbing 'em.

01:11:48.405 --> 01:11:51.975
Never easy being the one
holding all the cards.

01:11:53.377 --> 01:11:55.512
You're lucky I didn't run away.

01:11:55.545 --> 01:12:00.550
Where would you have gone?
We're miles from anywhere, kid?

01:12:00.584 --> 01:12:03.387
My back.

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.789
Here, why don't you go
grab us some firewood.

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:07.724
I packed breakfast.

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:11.461
Laura!

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:16.600
Laura, honey, breakfast is ready!

01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:20.937
Laura?

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:24.340
Lau...?

01:12:34.518 --> 01:12:35.719
Hello?

01:12:37.521 --> 01:12:39.956
She what?

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:42.992
I'll be right there.

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:50.500
So this is where Levi hid all that time?

01:12:50.534 --> 01:12:53.002
We combed this area a dozen times.

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:55.605
You know the story?

01:12:55.639 --> 01:12:57.941
He sat up there close to a half a year.

01:12:57.974 --> 01:12:59.876
Got me all kinds of bad press,

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:03.179
nearly had the town rooting for him.

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:08.585
Truth is, I enjoyed every minute of it.

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:12.388
Exhilaration, tracking your prey.

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:15.425
Hemingway said it best.

01:13:15.459 --> 01:13:20.530
"There is no hunting
like the hunting of man."

01:13:22.566 --> 01:13:25.068
I guess maybe you got a
little taste of that now, huh?

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:27.136
After killing Charlie.

01:13:31.207 --> 01:13:33.042
Fuckin' ay.

01:13:41.685 --> 01:13:44.588
Richie, this is Tom, come in, over.

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:47.524
<i>Stechel, what's your 20?</i>

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:52.061
Shut up, bitch!

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:55.999
<i>Richie, this is Tom, come in, over.</i>

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:02.839
What were you and your dad
doing out in the woods anyway?

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:05.542
Took me on a hunting trip.

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:07.143
Whitetail.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:11.615
Ah. You wanted to be
a big man hunter, huh?

01:14:11.648 --> 01:14:12.949
No.

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.151
Well.

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:17.954
Why was he teaching you?

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:23.960
Oh, little city boy and
his son bonding, huh?

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:35.071
There's this kid at school
that keeps beating me up,

01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:40.610
and he thought that hunting
would... I don't know.

01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:43.680
I tried to tell him
it was a stupid idea,

01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:45.749
but he wouldn't listen.

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:48.585
Well.

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:52.255
Especially since you
already got what it takes

01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:54.057
to handle a bully.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:58.562
It's true.

01:14:58.595 --> 01:15:04.868
See, bullies are about
one thing, intimidation.

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:07.003
And they feed off fear.

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:12.609
You take that away from 'em,
you stop 'em cold.

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:18.782
And I seen you not be
intimidated in spades.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.853
You know when you're
playing your video games

01:15:23.887 --> 01:15:30.226
and you're fully into it and
focused, ready for anything?

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.861
It's like you're outside of yourself,

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:35.832
but in control of this warrior.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:41.337
That's the attitude you gotta
give a bully. Completely still.

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:46.643
In your mind, you're able to
change what's about to happen.

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:50.146
In your heart, there's no fear.

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:56.853
There is nothing he can do to
you that you can't overcome.

01:15:58.722 --> 01:16:03.927
You stare at him,
think you're unstoppable.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.895
You shake your head.

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:10.166
No more.

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:19.843
That'll back 'em down,
99 times out of 100.

01:16:19.876 --> 01:16:22.846
What about that one time it doesn't?

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:24.681
Well.

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:30.787
In that case, son, you just
hit 'em with all you got.

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:34.157
Or run.

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:38.094
Hey, no shame in either.

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:43.032
Just like you did with Charlie,
before you threw that key.

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:46.970
Yeah, something like that.

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:49.272
Danny.

01:16:51.808 --> 01:16:55.144
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

01:16:57.914 --> 01:16:59.348
It's okay.

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:20.003
You remind me of him.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.676
I always liked your pop.

01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:28.011
Your mom, too.

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:31.915
Very special woman, your mom.

01:17:32.882 --> 01:17:35.351
I think about her sometimes.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.756
When I was young, I remember thinking

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:42.892
I was gonna grow old with these people.

01:17:42.926 --> 01:17:44.694
Jesus.

01:17:44.728 --> 01:17:46.329
Now, here I am, about to retire,

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:51.267
and I feel like...
Like it's a different life.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:57.440
It's tragic what happened that day.

01:17:57.473 --> 01:17:59.342
I couldn't believe when
I came around that bend

01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:02.678
and saw him at the bottom
of that ravine.

01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:09.318
I scrambled down the cliff
as fast as I could.

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:11.755
I thought you heard him fall.

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:13.890
His yell, that's what
it said in the paper,

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:15.158
that's what Dottie told me.

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.063
Good memory.

01:18:21.497 --> 01:18:24.333
I guess you're right.

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:28.471
It's been a long time since
I thought about that day.

01:18:28.504 --> 01:18:31.240
All I'm trying to say is, you were...

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:35.845
You were just lucky to
have really good parents.

01:18:35.879 --> 01:18:37.545
Yeah, well, I just wish
I'd gotten to know him

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.015
as well as you had.

01:18:51.795 --> 01:18:54.230
What are you waiting for?

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:10.746
Geez, where is she with that firewood?

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:18.321
You know, I also brought some of this.

01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:22.892
Who doesn't love those
little marshmallows?

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:27.330
<i>Levi!</i>

01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:40.076
It's Will Beeman!

01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:47.483
Come on.

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.066
It's all here!

01:20:08.071 --> 01:20:09.572
You come alone?

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:16.012
Yeah.

01:20:18.915 --> 01:20:21.184
You got the money?

01:20:21.217 --> 01:20:24.988
I got your money, you got my son?

01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:29.825
- Should we let him in?
- Yeah!

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:47.510
I'm coming in.

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:58.221
- That full?
- It's all here.

01:21:15.471 --> 01:21:17.173
I'm sorry.

01:21:19.008 --> 01:21:20.944
I'm so sorry, kiddo.

01:21:23.246 --> 01:21:25.514
Are you okay?
He didn't hurt you, did he?

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:26.983
No, no, no.

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:31.254
He's not the real robber, Dad.

01:21:31.287 --> 01:21:35.658
- Well, he is, but...
- I know.

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:47.170
You got the money?

01:21:49.072 --> 01:21:50.439
Possibly.

01:21:51.307 --> 01:21:55.044
Are we good? Can we go?

01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:09.558
Levi.

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.965
Any chance I can get my rifle back?

01:22:15.999 --> 01:22:17.933
Kinda special to me.

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:44.393
Come on, let's go.

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:09.152
- Good luck, Danny.
- Good luck, Levi.

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:17.526
Who is that?

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:18.727
- Who is that?
- I tried.

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:20.596
- Okay, you tried?
- I tried to come alone...

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:22.298
- Who is that?
- It's Howell.

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:24.533
- You brought Howell?
- Look, I tried, all right?

01:23:24.567 --> 01:23:25.907
He's behind the robbery.

01:23:25.909 --> 01:23:27.271
Hey, Danny, you just stay back there.

01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:29.038
The mastermind of
the whole goddamn thing.

01:23:29.072 --> 01:23:33.276
- What?
- I told you not to bring any cops!

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:37.280
God damn you, city boy.

01:23:42.585 --> 01:23:45.688
Come on out, now!

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:49.758
There's some bad news
about your girlfriend!

01:23:53.329 --> 01:23:54.797
She's dead!

01:23:59.435 --> 01:24:02.105
Hey! You hear me?

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:07.376
Come on! It's all over!

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:10.579
Don't do it, man.

01:24:20.323 --> 01:24:22.658
Come on, let's go.

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:35.604
Hey, hey look at me.

01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:38.307
Danny, Danny, look at me.

01:24:38.341 --> 01:24:39.675
It's okay, all right?

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:43.679
Hey, we got this, all right?
Come on.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.823
<i>Give me my fuckin' money!</i>

01:24:54.857 --> 01:24:56.792
Come on, let's go!

01:24:56.825 --> 01:24:58.727
Let's go!

01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:00.329
Let's go!

01:25:04.167 --> 01:25:06.235
All right, let's go.

01:25:25.321 --> 01:25:26.822
Come on, Dad!

01:25:28.757 --> 01:25:31.294
Aw, fuck.

01:25:31.327 --> 01:25:33.162
On the ground, bitch.

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:37.833
Ah, shit.

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:40.436
No one can find Richie anywhere.

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:42.805
Laura knew that Will
was at the post office,

01:25:42.838 --> 01:25:45.408
which means Richie
probably knows now, too.

01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:46.809
So is that where we should go?

01:25:46.842 --> 01:25:50.513
No, look, look.
One mile due north of the mill run

01:25:50.546 --> 01:25:54.517
and Grugen Hollow intersection,
we go here.

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:55.718
Okay.

01:26:04.593 --> 01:26:06.295
How's that?

01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:29.818
Come on, Tom, we ain't got all day!

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:31.454
Move it!

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:37.926
All right, here it is, come on.

01:26:40.996 --> 01:26:43.332
All right, I need you climb up
there and wait for me, okay?

01:26:43.366 --> 01:26:43.933
Yeah.

01:26:43.935 --> 01:26:45.635
You're gonna get your
body flat on the floor,

01:26:45.668 --> 01:26:47.869
and don't make a sound or move
a muscle until I get back.

01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:49.838
- You got it?
- Got it.

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:53.276
- All right, I love you, kiddo.
- Love you, too.

01:26:53.309 --> 01:26:54.710
Go do it.

01:27:15.598 --> 01:27:18.501
Come on, let's go, now!

01:27:28.777 --> 01:27:31.013
All right, now lay down.

01:27:31.046 --> 01:27:32.681
Okay.

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:38.421
Richie, get that kid!

01:27:38.454 --> 01:27:40.556
- Okay!
- No!

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:44.593
No! No, no!

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.989
Room for two up there?

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:39.748
- You let her go!
- That's my money!

01:28:39.782 --> 01:28:41.650
I'm not letting her go!

01:28:41.684 --> 01:28:43.852
This is over, Howell!

01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:45.921
What are you some kind of hero, now?

01:28:45.954 --> 01:28:50.092
I got news for you, Billy.
It doesn't work that way!

01:28:50.125 --> 01:28:54.597
See, I know about heroes,
I protect this entire community.

01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:56.565
You fucking steal from it.

01:28:56.599 --> 01:28:58.734
It's federally insured, you idiot.

01:28:58.767 --> 01:29:01.103
The bank will give you
back every last cent.

01:29:01.136 --> 01:29:03.406
What's a lousy two million
for all I've done

01:29:03.439 --> 01:29:05.107
for the people of Granville?

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.644
Now throw that fuckin' bag over here?

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:13.949
Uh-uh. No more.

01:29:28.063 --> 01:29:30.733
I'm gonna count to three.

01:29:30.766 --> 01:29:32.000
You need to let her go.

01:29:32.034 --> 01:29:34.503
You can count to three?

01:29:34.537 --> 01:29:37.773
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:42.945
Now get the fuck out of here before
I put one in your fuckin' head.

01:29:42.978 --> 01:29:44.513
One.

01:29:44.547 --> 01:29:46.782
I gave my life to this town,

01:29:46.815 --> 01:29:48.784
and what thanks do I get?

01:29:48.817 --> 01:29:50.653
Two.

01:29:50.686 --> 01:29:52.955
I'm gonna put two in her
fuckin' head, right now.

01:29:52.988 --> 01:29:54.823
Let's see if you got the precision

01:29:54.857 --> 01:29:56.992
to splatter my brains and not hers.

01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:03.165
Go ahead, you're a killer now, right?

01:30:03.198 --> 01:30:05.801
Since you shot Charlie yesterday?

01:30:05.834 --> 01:30:08.871
You got all that juice
flowing through you?

01:30:08.904 --> 01:30:12.040
I remember how that felt,
the first time.

01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:16.044
Right after I pushed
your dad off that cliff.

01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:29.658
Three.

01:30:31.894 --> 01:30:34.129
Put the gun down!

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.932
Danny! Danny, no!

01:30:39.868 --> 01:30:43.005
Oh my God, isn't this precious?

01:30:43.038 --> 01:30:45.941
- <i>Danny!</i>
- I got the shot, Dad.

01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:49.678
No!

01:30:49.712 --> 01:30:52.548
You know what they say about
women and children first.

01:30:52.581 --> 01:30:55.050
Danny, no, no!

01:30:56.051 --> 01:30:58.220
I can do it!

01:30:58.253 --> 01:30:59.855
Put the gun down, son.

01:30:59.888 --> 01:31:03.492
Danny, Danny!

01:31:34.823 --> 01:31:36.191
Levi!

01:31:44.933 --> 01:31:47.169
Levi, come on!

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:50.706
Danny, Danny!

01:32:06.822 --> 01:32:08.957
- Mom!
- Danny!

01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:17.566
Are you okay?

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:19.835
I'm okay.

01:32:23.338 --> 01:32:24.840
Oh!

01:32:28.076 --> 01:32:29.812
My goodness.

01:33:31.874 --> 01:33:36.278
It's pretty exciting, we were able
to recover all the money for the bank...

01:33:54.963 --> 01:33:57.265
Why don't you add this
to your collection?

01:33:57.299 --> 01:34:00.202
Think it belongs here anyways.

01:34:00.235 --> 01:34:03.305
Besides, Danny doesn't need
to shoot anything

01:34:03.338 --> 01:34:05.007
to prove how tough he is.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.976
He's already more of a man than most.

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:43.078
- You good, kiddo?
- I'm good, Dad.

01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:48.817
That's my boy.
