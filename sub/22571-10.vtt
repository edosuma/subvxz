00:02.803 --> 00:05.673
- What's the difference between
a treasure and a trinket?

00:05.773 --> 00:08.876
- Okay, well, trinkets is
just anything kind of small.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.578
Like, a trinket--like, you can

00:10.678 --> 00:12.413
put it on a shelf, you know?
- Okay.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.948
- Like, you know,
a porcelain ballerina.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.687
- Treasure is, like,
one of a kind, like treasure.

00:19.787 --> 00:20.688
You can't find it
just anywhere.

00:20.788 --> 00:21.689
- Like me!
- Yeah!

00:21.789 --> 00:23.324
Like you, Ivy.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.598
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:30.698 --> 00:32.966
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:33.067 --> 00:34.468
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:34.568 --> 00:36.470
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.805
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.140
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:39.240 --> 00:40.841
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:40.941 --> 00:42.376
- You shut your face.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.545
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.713
- We're back, baby!

00:48.849 --> 00:55.256
*

00:55.356 --> 00:57.225
- Welcome to Adelanto.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.993
And we may be really hot
and sandy,

01:00.094 --> 01:02.196
and it takes a lot of
advertisement to get people

01:02.296 --> 01:04.732
to drive this far, but it's
guaranteed, Danny,

01:04.832 --> 01:08.636
that when they do show up,
we always have a barn burner.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.338
I love desert auctions.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.540
Everyone's looking
for a scorching-hot unit.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.508
- We're gonna break out
our auction water.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.145
We're gonna keep them hydrated.
- Keep 'em at the auction.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.546
- And we're gonna beat some of
this heat this morning.

01:18.646 --> 01:19.547
- I love it.
- That'd be great.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.648
What do you think?

01:20.748 --> 01:23.617
Bing! Cha-ching!

01:23.717 --> 01:27.521
- I'm in Adelanto or something.
The middle of nowhere.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.190
Got up super early to get here.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.625
The early bird
catches the worm,

01:31.725 --> 01:32.893
so that means this chick

01:32.993 --> 01:34.995
is gonna land a sweet locker.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.564
Woke up at the crack of dawn,

01:36.664 --> 01:38.799
and I'm not leaving home
with nothing.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.735
*

01:41.835 --> 01:43.704
- You know what I like
about Adelanto?

01:43.804 --> 01:45.539
- Nothing.
- Nothing at all.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.176
- I got to tell you, J,
I'm a little wiped out.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.778
Maybe you just get, like,
a smaller unit today?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.680
- I'll just watch.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.415
- You want to be
a spectator today?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.016
- I could supervise.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.719
- I like spectator
better than supervisor.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.788
- Okay, whatever.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.291
Whatever makes you
feel better.

02:03.391 --> 02:06.827
- Look at it. It's early in the
morning, and it's 95 degrees.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.762
Today, I'ma assert myself.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.031
These city chumps--
every time they come down here,

02:11.131 --> 02:14.435
they cry,
"It's hot. I'm melting."

02:14.535 --> 02:15.703
It might be hot in the desert,

02:15.803 --> 02:17.771
but Ivy was born
and bred out here.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.441
So that means I'ma get
some hot units.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.376
I'm like ice, baby.
I don't ever melt.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.646
I just stay ice
all day long.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.515
- Today I'm heading out
to Adelanto.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.683
Last time I was out there,
I got lucky and scored

02:29.783 --> 02:32.553
on a real cool engine.
Made some pretty good money.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.888
You know, in this business,
if you get lucky at one place,

02:34.988 --> 02:36.957
you go back.
It's just like the casino.

02:37.057 --> 02:40.361
I'm gonna bet big in the desert
and come away the high roller.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.630
I'm gonna keep going
until my luck changes.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.997
Why wouldn't I?

02:44.097 --> 02:45.999
*

02:46.099 --> 02:49.403
- You got to be prepared.
All right.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.705
Let's go buy some units.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.275
- Like that hat, Mary.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.176
- You look cute.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.445
- He does look cute.
- You look cute!

02:57.545 --> 02:58.946
- Men don't look cute.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.381
- No, you do!
- That's a cute bonnet.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.416
- You've got cute knees!

03:02.516 --> 03:04.285
- You've got cute knees, Ivy!

03:04.385 --> 03:05.919
You know what,
if you'd show your knees,

03:06.019 --> 03:07.120
you'd get some knee
compliments also.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.589
- I will for the right price.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.990
- That's what I was going for
when I got up today.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.425
I want to have cute knees.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.228
- All right,
welcome to the auction.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.296
Before you go through
these gates,

03:15.396 --> 03:16.864
you need to know the rules.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.366
We're gonna go to the unit.
We're gonna remove the lock.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.900
We're gonna give you five
minutes to take a look around.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.770
You can't go inside,
you can't open any boxes,

03:22.870 --> 03:24.004
and whoever's got the most
money in their pocket

03:24.104 --> 03:25.005
can own it today!
Are you ready?

03:26.440 --> 03:27.475
All right then, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

03:27.575 --> 03:30.311
- I'm first. That-a-way!

03:30.411 --> 03:31.779
Mary!
- Got it.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.281
*

03:33.381 --> 03:34.982
- We're in the desert,
and it's hot, and it's sweaty,

03:35.082 --> 03:36.250
and I just want to make money.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.386
- What do you think about
this weather?

03:38.486 --> 03:39.720
- Same as yesterday.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.854
,
though, huh?

03:40.954 --> 03:42.155
- Like going in the backyard.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.624
- Anybody want a water,
we got water right here.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.092
We got auction H2O.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.560
If you're not hydrated,
get hydrated.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.095
Help yourselves!

03:48.195 --> 03:50.264
- Come on down!

03:50.364 --> 03:52.232
Whoo!
Nice clean unit!

03:52.333 --> 03:53.734
*

03:53.834 --> 03:56.870
I see some little furniture.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.240
Vacuum,
1990s little tulip lamp.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.611
Not too exciting. This wouldn't
be a smart move for me.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.045
- We got one of those before.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.947
Turn it around, it has a dial
on the other side.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.616
- And these kickass lamps.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.685
- That's like Sears and Roebuck
from '88.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.053
- All right.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.822
*

04:14.922 --> 04:17.991
- This little light is so cute.
Right from the '80s, '90s.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.728
Yeah, and the phone
is greatness.

04:20.828 --> 04:23.997
So maybe there's some trinkets
in these boxes.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.165
I'm in.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.368
*

04:27.468 --> 04:29.903
- Little chairs taken apart.
Who takes their chairs apart

04:30.003 --> 04:31.605
when they put them
in a storage unit?

04:31.705 --> 04:34.041
King of the jungle!

04:34.141 --> 04:36.143
- All right, if you're ready to
go, I'm ready to go.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.411
And here we go at number 20.
What's your pleasure?

04:37.511 --> 04:38.546
What are you gonna pay?

04:38.646 --> 04:39.847
- 25.
- I got 25 right there.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.316
50, 50, sir?
$50, looking for 75 now.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.152
Looking for 100 now.
- Yeah!

04:45.252 --> 04:48.055
- 100 right there.
125 now, 125, 150.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.824
150, 175, sir.
175, 200.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.428
225. 225?
- Tell him, folks.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.463
225 going once.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.864
I got 200 bucks.
Want to bid 225?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.065
- Don't let it pass you by!
- 225 going twice.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.402
I got 225 there!

05:01.502 --> 05:04.738
- Mary ain't sweating enough.
It's time to turn up the heat.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.408
- 250 there. 275.
What about 300

05:09.643 --> 05:12.279
325 now. I got 300 bucks.
325, and you're out.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.381
I got 300 bucks, 325?

05:13.481 --> 05:15.215
325 going once,
325 going twice,

05:15.315 --> 05:16.784
last and final call at 325,

05:16.884 --> 05:18.285
and I sold it your way, Mary.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.287
You got it for $300, Mary!

05:20.388 --> 05:22.656
- I don't like no trinket.
Lamps or furniture?

05:22.756 --> 05:25.459
- That tells me there's
potential for other trinkets.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.894
I can sell that stuff.

05:26.994 --> 05:27.961
- Next unit!
Come on, everybody.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.797
Let's do it, folks!

05:29.897 --> 05:31.632
- All right, I'm gonna
sneak a peek.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.935
So this cute little lamp,
'80s, '90s.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.637
150 bucks for this thing.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.205
*

05:38.305 --> 05:39.707
And we'll go the same
with the phone.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.843
At least 150 bucks
for this thing too.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.045
Looks like crusty plush. Out.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.415
*

05:47.515 --> 05:50.618
Some just pots and pans.
Nothing for me.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.852
*

05:53.387 --> 05:55.689
Ooh, this thing looks
kind of cool, maybe.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.593
Oh, wow! So cool!

05:59.693 --> 06:01.862
It's a music box.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.931
Oh, my gosh, so cool.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.400
*

06:07.801 --> 06:10.237
Oh, my gosh, and it's working!

06:10.337 --> 06:13.006
So cute.
This is for sure old.

06:13.106 --> 06:16.844
Oh, yes! December 23, 1903.
This is so cool.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.112
Definitely have to
get this checked out.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.882
This thing is amazing!

06:21.982 --> 06:23.116
*

06:23.216 --> 06:24.818
Wow.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.521
It's a movie camera.
30 bucks?

06:27.621 --> 06:29.222
This dresser? Trash.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.358
But there might be something
in them.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.527
Nope.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.996
Ew, crusty plush.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.364
And nope.

06:37.465 --> 06:38.632
These chairs are cute.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.067
For the whole set...

06:40.167 --> 06:42.169
one, two, three, four, five,
six, with the table.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.304
I'll say 150 bucks for the set.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.406
Shop-Vac, 20 bucks.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.909
This dresser I can't sell.
It's just too beat up.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.880
And this stuff is crusty plush.
So that's it!

06:52.980 --> 06:55.849
I'm really counting on that
music box to score me

06:55.949 --> 06:57.518
some more money.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.987
I'm gonna put this stuff back
in and get back to the auction.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.822
*

07:01.922 --> 07:03.857
- Hold on. I'm just making you
so you look fresh.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.859
- You don't have
to pat me down.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.395
- Everybody's soft but me
around here.

07:08.496 --> 07:11.098
The shade might protect these
weaklings from the UV rays,

07:11.198 --> 07:12.966
but it ain't gonna do nothing
to protect them

07:13.066 --> 07:15.302
from Ivy's powerful rays.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.940
- Aw yeah,
you know what happens

07:20.040 --> 07:21.775
when sparks fly in Adelanto!

07:21.875 --> 07:24.111
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

07:24.211 --> 07:26.279
*

07:26.379 --> 07:28.348
- Well, it looks like we got
a bedroom set in here,

07:28.448 --> 07:31.719
and we got a bicycle
and some pots and pans.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.655
This one doesn't look like
I'm gonna get that lucky on.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.390
But if it goes cheap enough,
it might pay for gas money

07:37.491 --> 07:39.727
and an ice cream cone,
because it's hot.

07:39.827 --> 07:40.728
Some water, buddy?

07:42.029 --> 07:44.031
*

07:44.131 --> 07:45.999
- Ah, there you go.

07:46.099 --> 07:50.003
- One, two, three, four, five.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.406
Wow, five reasons not to buy.
Can I find one to buy?

07:53.507 --> 07:54.675
That could be cool.
I don't know what it is,

07:54.775 --> 07:56.376
but--ooh, mighty dirty.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.378
I'm gonna bid a little bit.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.281
- This is a unit that I call
too many mattresses.

08:01.381 --> 08:02.482
- Okay.
- All right.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.684
- Moving right along.
- All right.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.385
- Well, there's some furniture
in here,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.187
but it's not very well-made.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.922
There's some mattresses.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.091
Oh, crusty plush.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.260
I don't see any real trinkets

08:13.360 --> 08:15.729
that I could put on
marysfinds.com, so...

08:15.829 --> 08:18.566
- I think those mattresses
could be considered trinkets.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.133
- No.
- I think so.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.736
- That's crusty plush.
- You could put 'em on a desk.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.304
- All right, if you're
ready to go, I'm ready to go.

08:24.404 --> 08:25.839
And here we go.
Who will give me $25?

08:25.939 --> 08:27.608
Right there.
35, where?

08:27.708 --> 08:28.909
I got 35.
What about 45?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.510
What about 45 there?
55, sir?

08:30.611 --> 08:32.680
55, how about 65?
65, how about 75?

08:32.780 --> 08:34.014
75, 85.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.282
95 now.

08:35.382 --> 08:38.351
105, 115? 105 and 115.

08:38.451 --> 08:41.354
105, 115, 125, 135, sir?
- Yep!

08:41.454 --> 08:44.157
- Yep!

08:44.257 --> 08:47.761
- Yep!

08:47.861 --> 08:49.630
- 175, 185. $185.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.632
195!

08:51.732 --> 08:53.500
185? 195.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.669
195 going once.
195 going twice.

08:55.769 --> 08:56.670
Last and final call.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.672
195?

08:58.772 --> 09:01.842
Sold it your way, $185.
- Cost me $100.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.410
- All right, folks!

09:03.510 --> 09:04.812
- Even with the sky-high
temperatures,

09:04.912 --> 09:07.080
Ivy got a cool locker.

09:09.883 --> 09:13.353
- Here we go! Unit, unit, unit!

09:13.453 --> 09:14.722
*

09:14.822 --> 09:16.123
- There you go.
Let's see.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.424
There's a safe.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.092
There's lots of boxes,
neatly stacked.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.427
There's probably some
good stuff in there.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.262
*

09:22.362 --> 09:24.798
- Well, two canopies,
a wheelchair.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.066
A couple of appliances.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.769
All boxes taped, and sealed,
and clean.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.504
This is the best room
of the day by a long ways.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.540
- Hey, what do you see
right there?

09:33.641 --> 09:35.809
- Oh, dear. Money.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.446
Freezer. Block rocker.
Better than I thought.

09:39.546 --> 09:43.951
- About 20 boxes. Old fridge,
old freezer, old wheelchair.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.719
There is a safe in here.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.989
- That looks like a safe that
has a dime, and a paperclip,

09:49.089 --> 09:50.758
and the combination
inside of it.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.325
- Maybe some porn.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.294
- Some of that porn you don't
want your kids to see.

09:55.663 --> 09:56.764
- 'Cause there's some porn...
- Yeah.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.935
- All right, if you're ready
to go, I am ready to go.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.070
And here we go.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.537
500?

10:04.638 --> 10:05.839
Get 200 to 300.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.007
And 300 there.
And 300, 400.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.475
400 there.
Now 500, 500, where?

10:08.575 --> 10:11.344
400, 500, 600, 500,
600, 600 where?

10:11.444 --> 10:12.680
500, 600, 600 where?

10:12.780 --> 10:13.781
What about 600?
Going once.

10:13.881 --> 10:14.782
What about 550, going twice?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.116
550 there.
- Whoo!

10:16.216 --> 10:17.885
650.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.853
What about 700?
What about 700, 700 to you.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.694
I got 750, what about 800?
800, Ivy, you're out.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.196
800, Ivy, 800.
But 800 where?

10:29.296 --> 10:30.731
I got 750 going once.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.932
800, 800, going twice.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.133
Last and final call,
800 bucks.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.468
And I sold it your way.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.905
- Lock it up, Jarrod, 750.
- Whoo.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.572
- Thank you, folks,
that's the end of the sale.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.141
And don't forget
to pay the lady.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.442
Thank you, everyone.

10:42.542 --> 10:45.045
Hey, Dave, that was
really nice of you.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.880
- To feed that dog and give it

10:46.980 --> 10:48.448
water like that.
- Oh, I'm a dog lover.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.817
I am too, and that's something

10:49.917 --> 10:50.884
we have in common.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.152
- Yep.
- Are we ever gonna

10:52.252 --> 10:54.121
work it out or shake it out?
- No.

10:54.221 --> 10:59.226
- Not any time soon.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.263
*

11:03.363 --> 11:05.833
- Teamwork.
- Okay, I'll watch--

11:05.933 --> 11:07.100
and tell you when to lift
with your knees.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.535
- No.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.437
- Jarrod bought this locker
on a million degree day.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.372
He is lucky I'm not
sitting in the car.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.674
- Wheelchair's 50 bucks.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.976
Let's pull this back.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.945
Lookit!
Eight phones.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.279
200 bucks.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.014
- $100 in the fridge.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.382
Babe, I got the block rocker.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.616
Probably get 50 bucks for it.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.118
- Sweet.
- Two TVs.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.319
That's at least 100 bucks.

11:26.419 --> 11:30.490
- Oh, my God, so many weaves.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.361
*

11:34.461 --> 11:36.797
What?
Brandi, what is this?

11:36.897 --> 11:37.831
- I don't know.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.666
- My first meth lab.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.402
- Uh...
- Look at how old it looks.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.838
- Bromate.
- The North American...

11:44.938 --> 11:46.740
- Acid, ooh, don't touch that.
- Fiber Products Company.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.508
Let's set this aside.
- That thing's cool.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.010
- We might have to get
this thing checked out.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.411
- Yeah, that thing's awesome.
- Just 'cause of the age

11:51.511 --> 11:52.712
if nothing else.
- Yeah.

11:52.813 --> 11:53.914
- We got to move this along.
- All right.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.115
- I'm gonna die in, like,
20 minutes.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.449
- My gloves are just
melting, look.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.818
They're melting right off.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.187
- Computer monitor, 40 bucks.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.922
*

12:02.022 --> 12:04.124
- Hmm.
- Whoa!

12:04.224 --> 12:06.259
Holy , Brandi,
look at this.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.727
Make me a spot.
- Okay.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.296
- You gotta check this out.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.899
Oh, now I have nowhere
to get down.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.902
- You could pretty much
get down anywhere you want.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.006
Come on, this thing is
very something.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.109
- Here. Yeah, here.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.443
- Ooh.
.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.812
That looks involved.
Do you think that has

12:24.912 --> 12:26.113
anything to do
with that last thing?

12:26.213 --> 12:27.647
- Yeah, I'm sure...
- They're definitely

12:27.747 --> 12:29.850
different generations.
- It does.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.485
- "Luminometer."

12:32.585 --> 12:34.087
- We definitely should get
these things checked out.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.122
Let's keep looking.
- Okay, all right.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.790
- Set that aside.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.558
Pots and pans, trash.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.227
*

12:40.327 --> 12:41.461
Clothes.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.430
*

12:43.530 --> 12:45.065
Ooh, something.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.767
- Oh, my God.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.904
40 bucks.
- One more box to go.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.239
Nothing...
- Okay.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.574
- Personal care products.
What do you think

12:54.674 --> 12:56.309
about this table and those
chairs right there?

12:56.409 --> 12:58.045
They're probably 80 bucks.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.412
- God, we are
blowing it lately.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.548
- This was a lot of work,
and we made no money,

13:01.648 --> 13:03.516
and I'm sweating my ass off
right now.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.719
- Those test kits--hopefully
those are worth some money.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.989
*

13:09.089 --> 13:12.259
- Let's see what 185 gets you.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.794
I got medium hopes
that there's more than sand

13:14.895 --> 13:16.263
in this desert locker.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.831
Start right here
with the dusty one.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.334
*

13:21.434 --> 13:24.804
Big item.
Worth absolutely nothing.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.174
Hi.

13:27.274 --> 13:31.644
Mattresses, my most favorite
thing on Earth.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.848
Light a match,
I'd burn every one I had,

13:34.948 --> 13:36.449
but I'd save the gasoline.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.418
M-A-T-T-R-E-S.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.954
I'm gonna leave the last "S"
off, for "sucks."

13:41.054 --> 13:43.756
No money, no money, no money,
and no money.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.993
Bed here, okay condition.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.827
Probably can get $40
for that bed.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.997
I finished half the room
in 30 seconds,

13:50.097 --> 13:52.632
and I'm not even close
to my $185.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.201
Let's start with
the big motorcycle bag.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.236
It's stuff.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.571
Brand-new wine glass,
waffle maker,

13:58.671 --> 14:02.075
a George Foreman toaster.
I'm looking at about 25 bucks.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.811
Nothing and nothing.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.579
15 bucks.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.580
Pretty cool here.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.550
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.819
Good $150 box, right here.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.387
Come on, box.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.989
Well, Chip-O-Rack.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.891
That's looking like poker.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.127
Two bucks.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.162
Poker case, five bucks.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.599
I don't know what it is,
but it's heavy.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.468
Hmm.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.437
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I knew what is it.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.704
Ediphone.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.540
Kind of cool,
and it's damn sure heavy.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.574
Don't know what to do with it.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.243
Don't know what it's worth.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.078
Only one thing to do.
Find out.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.081
Ooh, come on, bag.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.515
Be good.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.984
Clothes.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.019
The bag is more expensive than
everything in it.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.387
Ten bucks.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.122
Ooh, laptop. HP.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.791
Has the cords. 80 bucks.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.360
Well, hey.
I made a little bit of money.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.928
And I got you to check out.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.330
Ain't nothing left to do
but ride off into the sunset.

14:57.430 --> 15:03.703
*

15:03.803 --> 15:05.238
- Here we go.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.240
I'm taking my music box
to Sally and Laurence

15:07.340 --> 15:08.775
at Studio Antiques.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.143
- Mmm-yup.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.945
Mmm-rrr.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.746
Oh, boy.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.315
This is gonna be fun.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.750
- Well, I can tell you
a little bit about it.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.987
See, it says the date
on the bottom of there.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.490
And the date is the 23rd
of December, 1903.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.792
- The company that made it
is Home.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.061
There was a Home sewing machine

15:28.161 --> 15:30.163
so I think that
that is the brand.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.132
It was kinda like your
home entertainment.

15:32.232 --> 15:35.135
And it plays these things.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.770
They call that a cob, because
it looks like a corn cob.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.173
- Oh, cute.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.808
- Yeah.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.343
- It's cute. I like it.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.945
- So, this thing is way old.
It works.

15:46.046 --> 15:51.484
I have no idea
how much it's worth.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.053
- If you just give it
the once-over
Tell me.
- It

15:53.153 --> 15:54.687
with a little bit of TLC,

15:54.787 --> 15:57.690
you're probably getting, um...

15:57.790 --> 15:58.825
After three--

15:58.925 --> 16:01.728
A-one, a-two, a-three!

16:01.828 --> 16:03.630
- 250!
- 450.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.898
- Oh, great, wow,
that's awesome.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.568
So maybe in the middle, 350.
- There you go.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.071
- Maybe 350.
- Awesome.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.806
350 bucks?
Now that's a sweet song

16:13.906 --> 16:15.275
if I've ever heard one.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.211
- * Yankee Doodle went to town
riding on a pony *

16:18.311 --> 16:22.182
* Stuck a feather in his hat
and called it macaroni *

16:23.683 --> 16:25.885
*

16:25.985 --> 16:27.287
- All Makes. All right.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.056
I'm meeting with John Danese

16:29.156 --> 16:31.858
to see if this machine will
give me a hefty price tag

16:31.958 --> 16:33.326
or just weigh me down.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.328
Ready to put it down, 'cause it
weigh about 50 pounds.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.696
Ugh.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.232
- So what you have here, Ivy,

16:39.332 --> 16:41.234
is an Ediphone.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.869
It was invented by
Thomas Edison.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.238
- The Thomas Edison.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.407
- The light bulb guy.
- The light bulb guy.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.309
- Wow. If Edison
invented this,

16:49.409 --> 16:50.543
it's got to be old.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.944
- This version here

16:52.045 --> 16:55.415
is somewhere between
1917 and 1923.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.650
- Whoo.
- And they would dictate on

16:57.750 --> 17:00.287
a wax cylinder.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.122
And you'd push that down,

17:02.222 --> 17:04.224
And then it would
engrave your voice

17:04.324 --> 17:05.492
in the wax cylinder.

17:06.826 --> 17:07.760
- It would sound
just like you.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.796
- So, I'm guessing

17:09.896 --> 17:12.765
this is old grandpa and this
is young grandchild.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.201
- Right, you're looking
at the evolution

17:14.301 --> 17:15.735
of the dictation industry.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.204
- This thing is old, obviously.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.538
What kind of props
can I record?

17:18.638 --> 17:19.739
- Well, it's a nice piece.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.508
You know, it's missing
some components,

17:21.608 --> 17:24.010
and the power cable,
and you're missing something

17:24.111 --> 17:25.512
really important--
the microphone.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.347
- Oh. That is
kind of important.

17:27.447 --> 17:31.118
- And to a dictation geek
like myself,

17:31.218 --> 17:32.685
I would give you...

17:32.785 --> 17:37.490
*

17:37.590 --> 17:39.959
187 bucks for it.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.594
- Right now.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.096
Bye, Ediphone.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.664
I just paid for my locker,

17:44.764 --> 17:46.433
and I don't got to carry
this thing back to the car?

17:46.533 --> 17:47.767
That's a win-win.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.202
Edison could've used this
machine right here.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.503
- Yes.
- Could've left me a message.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.638
- He could've.
- "Hey, Ivy.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.206
You're gonna make
some big bucks."

17:53.306 --> 17:56.509
*

17:56.609 --> 17:57.710
- It's like a little
island oasis

17:57.810 --> 17:59.512
in the middle of downtown LA.

17:59.612 --> 18:00.813
Hey.
- Hi.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.216
- Good. Welcome to LA River.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.618
- We're bringing our test kits
to Katherine Pease,

18:05.718 --> 18:07.687
a watershed scientist
for Heal the Bay.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.789
Hopefully this isn't a wash.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.724
So, here's what we brought you.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.860
- Okay, interesting.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.430
- So that looks like current
equipment, we're thinking.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.098
Yeah, very
state-of-the-art.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.268
All right, we got some
instructions here.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.503
Yes, of 1947.
- Nice.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.538
- Okay, it definitely looks
like you could test for

18:25.638 --> 18:27.240
water pH with this kit.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.908
You would add some
water here,

18:29.008 --> 18:30.343
add some of the reagents,

18:30.443 --> 18:33.045
and then look for a color
change with the dial.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.014
- Oh, yeah, they don't make 'em
with the spinning wheel

18:35.114 --> 18:36.283
like that anymore.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.717
- So we got this big guy, too.
- Okay.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.287
- Ah!
- Interesting.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.689
Okay. Here we've got the meter

18:42.789 --> 18:44.657
that will measure total
dissolved solids.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.659
We'll just stick this in
the water and get a reading.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.162
It looks like it's reading
about 570 now.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.398
- Is that, like, how much
broken

18:51.498 --> 18:53.600
- Um, so...

18:53.700 --> 18:55.602
This looks to me
sort of like

18:55.702 --> 18:58.238
somebody who is expecting
the end of the world.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.106
So this is an arsenic test,

19:00.207 --> 19:02.209
and there's mustard gas test.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.077
- This one is actually

19:05.178 --> 19:07.079
over $13,000 new.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.115
!
- Oh, my God.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.050
13 grand?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.819
Now that's what I call
preppin'.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.287
So, let's start with
this little kit.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.655
What do you think
that thing's worth?

19:15.755 --> 19:18.425
- Well, you know, it's not
super useful

19:18.525 --> 19:20.860
for a scientist to test
the water at this point.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.329
But it's definitely interesting

19:22.429 --> 19:23.730
as a collector item.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.832
I would say you would get
about $100 for that.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.166
- Yeah.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.401
- Yeah, that's something.
- Yeah.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.204
- This unit is definitely
valuable.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.372
- What do you think we
can get for it?

19:32.472 --> 19:34.040
To the right prepper?

19:34.140 --> 19:36.376
Um, to the right prepper,

19:36.476 --> 19:37.710
I think you could
probably get about

19:37.810 --> 19:39.045
2,000 or so.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.048
- $2,000, yeah.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.350
- Seems like we
passed the test.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.985
*

19:46.085 --> 19:47.520
- You keep making jokes
like that, Jarrod,

19:47.620 --> 19:49.456
I'll be storing you in
an underground bunker.

19:50.757 --> 19:51.724
- Most of it's coming from

19:51.824 --> 19:53.226
wastewater treatment plants...

19:53.326 --> 19:55.495
- Oh.
- So it's treated sewage.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.597
They do a really good job
of treating the waters.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.199
- But the water did used
to have some poop in it?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.401
- It did.
- Yes.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.702
*

20:02.802 --> 20:03.703
narrator: Jarrod and Brandi

20:03.803 --> 20:05.338
didn't sweat the details,

20:05.438 --> 20:08.841
making two grand on their
water testing kits.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.910
Mary Padian's music box

20:11.010 --> 20:14.347
cranked out $550.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.749
Ivy Calvin did some
heavy lifting,

20:16.849 --> 20:18.751
recording over 300 bucks.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.853
And Dave Hester's luck

20:20.953 --> 20:22.389
ran out.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.456
*

20:23.556 --> 20:25.925
- I just need to get
in there.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.894
- That's what she said.

20:27.994 --> 20:28.895
*

20:28.995 --> 20:30.229
Oh, you're in there.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.332
- That's what she said.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.301
- This wouldn't have taken you
so long before.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.502
- I'm getting older, babe.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.569
See, it takes longer at my age.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.339
- I hope it's cocaine.
I mean, cash.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.973
Not just trash wrapped up
in a bag.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.411
- Ugh!
- Ah, burnable CDs! Yes!

20:44.511 --> 20:46.245
Whoo, we got 'em!

20:46.346 --> 20:47.647
We hit the mother lode!
