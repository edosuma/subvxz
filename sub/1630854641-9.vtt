If we make it out

Well, we're on our way.

Holy [bleep].

06:19.967 --> 06:22.000
We almost didn't make it
out of the harbor

06:22.000 --> 06:24.367
because the guys forgot
to raise the spuds up.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.266
<i>But these winds</i>
<i>we're heading into,</i>

06:26.266 --> 06:27.767
<i>I did not account for.</i>

06:30.100 --> 06:32.066
It looks like

a rough ride

06:32.066 --> 06:33.867
<i>and a seriously</i>

06:35.667 --> 06:36.900

We aren't showing
any more codes.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.266
Right now,
it's the hydraulics problem.

07:24.266 --> 07:26.367
Without hydraulics
we can't run anything

07:26.367 --> 07:28.467
and for some reason,

07:28.467 --> 07:30.000
we are just not getting
any hydraulics pressure

07:30.000 --> 07:30.266
we are just not getting
any hydraulics pressure

[Kris] <i>Reaper Nation</i>

more time broke down

07:38.367 --> 07:39.367
than we are mining

07:39.367 --> 07:41.467
and last time out,
we got it to work,

07:41.467 --> 07:43.567
but it was at half speed
limp mode.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.767
[Kris] <i>It's taking up</i>
<i>twice as long</i>
<i>to do a scoop,</i>

07:49.600 --> 07:51.600

07:51.667 --> 07:54.100
[bleep] <i>that excavator.</i>
<i>It's pissing me off.</i>

07:55.100 --> 07:56.367
Which you're not
supposed to run at,

07:56.367 --> 07:58.700
by the way
and I know that now.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.000
<i>At the moment</i>
<i>we owe $125,000</i>
<i>by the end of the summer</i>

08:00.000 --> 08:02.200
<i>At the moment</i>
<i>we owe $125,000</i>
<i>by the end of the summer</i>

<i>and right now,</i>
<i>I got 36 ounces.</i>

08:05.166 --> 08:06.967
So we have to get
the <i>Mistress</i>

08:06.967 --> 08:09.266
back up to full
strength immediately.

08:09.266 --> 08:11.467
A literally only one sack
of [bleep] machine

08:11.467 --> 08:13.266
is stopping me
from doing well.

08:14.767 --> 08:17.367
Oh, I'm pissed.
I'm [bleep] pissed.

08:17.367 --> 08:19.367
There's nothing
I can do, either,

08:19.367 --> 08:21.467
which, then...
what makes me
even more pissed.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.667
[man speaking]

08:35.467 --> 08:38.000
Can we take the solenoid
off of the track

08:38.000 --> 08:40.100
and can we use that
for solenoid one

08:40.166 --> 08:42.166
and just not use
the track ever again?

08:42.166 --> 08:44.367
[mechanic speaking]

08:44.367 --> 08:46.900
The good thing about
everything breaking
all the time

08:46.967 --> 08:49.967
is you become an expert
at fixing things.

08:49.967 --> 08:52.667
<i>So, right here,</i>
<i>the excavator has</i>
<i>different solenoids</i>

08:52.667 --> 08:54.000
<i>that do different things.</i>

08:54.066 --> 08:56.300
The one that works
the tracks, is okay,

08:56.367 --> 08:57.667
<i>but that doesn't help me.</i>

08:57.667 --> 08:59.500
<i>We're not driving</i>
<i>it anywhere.</i>

08:59.567 --> 09:00.000
So if we swap out
the dead one that runs
the hydraulics,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.200
So if we swap out
the dead one that runs
the hydraulics,

09:02.266 --> 09:04.066
<i>we might get this system</i>
<i>up and running again,</i>

09:04.066 --> 09:05.700
<i>at full strength.</i>

09:05.767 --> 09:08.800
Little, by little,
we've been replacing
all the components.

09:08.867 --> 09:11.266
The last thing on
the page is this solenoid

09:11.266 --> 09:14.100
and I think, this thing
is going to fire right up

09:14.166 --> 09:16.400
and the hydraulics
are going to work,

09:16.467 --> 09:18.967
not to every system
but who gives a [bleep]?

09:18.967 --> 09:20.967
We only need
a couple of the systems

09:20.967 --> 09:22.400
to work with
the hydraulics,

09:22.467 --> 09:24.166
the boom, the swivel,

09:24.166 --> 09:26.367
you know, the bucket.
That's all I really need.

09:26.367 --> 09:28.367
[bleep] these tracks.
[bleep] them twice.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.000
If we can get this
to fire up,

09:30.000 --> 09:30.767
If we can get this
to fire up,

09:30.767 --> 09:32.500
we're going to be
mining today.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.700
Here we are,
moment of truth.

09:39.767 --> 09:41.867
I'm telling you, I think
this is going to work.

09:41.867 --> 09:44.400
Don't listen to
all these people
behind me.

I was going to

This season seems like
nothing's been going right

-Yup.

-I got to tell Verne.
-Yeah.

13:02.367 --> 13:03.867
[man] Verne,
there's a problem.

13:06.467 --> 13:08.066
Thomas just went
to start the motor

13:08.066 --> 13:09.402
and a whole bunch
of smoke and sparks

13:09.402 --> 13:09.467
and a whole bunch
of smoke and sparks

13:09.467 --> 13:10.300
just came out
of the motor.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.200
[bleep]

13:16.600 --> 13:18.200
[Vernon] If ain't
one thing, it's another.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.000
Go ahead, Thomas,

13:21.066 --> 13:23.467
could you show
where that smoke
was coming from?

13:23.467 --> 13:25.000
[Thomas] Here's
your starter

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
and it's not even trying
to turn over, though.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.567
What I think it's doing
is shooting sparks
off the terminal.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.767
[Vernon] All right,
so it's smoked.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.867
Nothing we can
do about it.

13:33.867 --> 13:35.367
Let's go get
another starter.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.867
[bleep]

13:43.266 --> 13:44.667
Let the anchor drop.

13:44.667 --> 13:45.900
Let's go back to town.

13:47.767 --> 13:49.266
[Vernon] <i>Here's the thing.</i>

13:49.266 --> 13:52.200
We've got leaks
and some destroyed
electrical equipment

13:52.266 --> 13:54.100
because of that
rescue mission.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.200
<i>So, now, when we got</i>
<i>our engines swamped,</i>

13:56.266 --> 13:59.567
<i>it seems to have fried</i>
<i>our starter to boot.</i>

13:59.567 --> 14:01.000
I pray that's all it is.

14:01.066 --> 14:03.266
Hopefully, we can
fix the starter.

14:03.266 --> 14:06.266
But, honestly,
if it's a deeper problem
then that,

14:06.266 --> 14:07.867
our season may have
just ended.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.800
[Vernon] No doubt
what happened.

14:11.867 --> 14:13.667
We were taking
heavy seas,

14:15.100 --> 14:17.367
<i>against the side of the ship</i>
<i>on both sides.</i>

everything else
back there

14:24.266 --> 14:25.667

with salt water.

"No good deed
goes unpunished."

14:33.467 --> 14:35.200
Well, that's what
I'm feeling like, right now.

It's like 5-foot swell
going on

and when you're down there
at the bottom,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.600
it just throws you
all around.

19:21.567 --> 19:23.467
"Beef swellington."
[laughs]

19:23.467 --> 19:25.700
It's a little bit
of a beef swellington
out here.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.400
[Shem laughing]

19:28.467 --> 19:29.967
[everyone laughs]

19:33.900 --> 19:34.834
[narrator]
<i>While the Havilah</i>

19:34.834 --> 19:36.367
<i>bastes in</i>
<i>the "beef swellington",</i>

19:38.166 --> 19:39.400
<i>across the claim...</i>

19:41.367 --> 19:43.767
<i>Mr. Gold's braving</i>
<i>the choppy waters</i>

19:43.767 --> 19:47.100
<i>with his 600-tonne</i>
Myrtle Irene.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.867
[Shawn]
<i>We're here, finally.</i>

19:49.867 --> 19:52.767
[narrator] <i>And he's ready</i>
<i>to tap into virgin ground</i>

19:52.767 --> 19:54.300
<i>on the bottom</i>
<i>of the Tomcod.</i>

19:55.967 --> 19:57.800
Let's go ahead
and spud down.

20:03.967 --> 20:06.867
<i>We're going to go ahead,</i>
<i>get everything fired up.</i>

20:06.867 --> 20:08.500
<i>Start running dirt.</i>

20:08.567 --> 20:09.402
<i>Washy, washy.</i>

20:09.402 --> 20:10.567
<i>Washy, washy.</i>

20:10.567 --> 20:12.600
<i>These are the chances</i>
<i>that we live for.</i>

20:12.667 --> 20:15.367
<i>My drill logs say that</i>
<i>this hole is hot as hell.</i>

20:15.367 --> 20:16.867
But we've never been
able to dig here

20:16.867 --> 20:18.467
with the <i>Myrtle</i> before

20:18.467 --> 20:20.100
<i>and I hope I'm right.</i>

20:20.166 --> 20:22.667
<i>I've been aiming</i>
<i>for 3000 ounces</i>
<i>this summer,</i>

20:22.667 --> 20:24.767
but I'm still
500 ounces short.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.467
<i>There's a ton of gold</i>
<i>in the deeper water</i>

20:32.467 --> 20:35.367
where we can't
touch normally.

20:35.367 --> 20:38.066
<i>that means gold's gonna be</i>
<i>really, really good today.</i>

20:40.266 --> 20:42.667
These north winds made it
tough to get out here.

20:42.667 --> 20:44.567
But they're our best friends
right now.

20:44.567 --> 20:46.667
<i>The</i> Myrtle <i>can reach 26 feet.</i>

20:46.667 --> 20:48.667
<i>This gravel's usually</i>
<i>a lot deeper,</i>

20:48.667 --> 20:50.867
<i>but with these low tides,</i>
<i>we can hit it.</i>

20:50.867 --> 20:52.800
<i>And it should be untouched.</i>

20:52.867 --> 20:54.800
So, monster payday,
here we come.

20:56.066 --> 20:57.367
Time to make some money!

21:00.467 --> 21:01.767
We have a possibility

21:01.767 --> 21:03.800
of doing a quarter
to a half million dollars

21:03.867 --> 21:05.700
<i>in a very short</i>
<i>amount of time.</i>

21:10.066 --> 21:11.200
Gonna dig all night.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.600
<i>Half a million dollars.</i>

21:14.667 --> 21:15.667
<i>Here we go.</i>

21:17.867 --> 21:19.667
<i>I'd be happy</i>
<i>with a quarter million.</i>

21:21.767 --> 21:23.300
I'm gonna shoot for the stars.

21:27.900 --> 21:28.967
Yeah!

21:29.800 --> 21:31.367
North winds, we love you.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.367
<i>Come on, baby!</i>

21:33.367 --> 21:34.800
<i>Let's go!</i>

21:34.867 --> 21:37.266
[chanting]
<i>We are gonna slick it!</i>

21:47.567 --> 21:49.867
[Kris] <i>We need money.</i>
<i>We just plain need money.</i>

21:49.867 --> 21:51.000
We're gonna get out there,

21:51.066 --> 21:52.100
we're gonna make
some easy gold,

21:52.166 --> 21:54.066
and this is gonna be
a great day.

21:54.066 --> 21:56.266
[narrator] <i>The mighty</i> Mistress
<i>is at full strength</i>

21:56.266 --> 21:58.066

21:59.066 --> 22:00.400
[Kris] We're getting ready
to go right now,

22:00.467 --> 22:01.700
start up the Thrustmaster.

22:01.767 --> 22:03.000
[engine starting]

22:04.166 --> 22:06.300
[narrator] <i>But the crew</i>
<i>of the mighty</i> Mistress?

22:06.367 --> 22:08.767
<i>Well, that's</i>
<i>a different story.</i>

22:08.767 --> 22:10.400
We were supposed to leave
an hour ago,

22:10.467 --> 22:12.767
everybody goes on
a [bleep] joyride.

22:12.767 --> 22:14.867
I couldn't be more clear
when we were leaving the dock.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.967
I told everybody to stick by
so we can go out.

22:17.967 --> 22:20.000
While I'm finishing
repairing the excavator,

22:20.066 --> 22:21.300
<i>Andy and James take off</i>

22:21.367 --> 22:23.367
<i>and who knows what</i>
<i>the hell they're doing.</i>

22:23.367 --> 22:25.266
And now I'm standing here
waiting for them.

22:25.266 --> 22:26.467
Every minute that passes

22:26.467 --> 22:28.100
is a minute I'm not mining.

22:28.166 --> 22:29.367
It's like watching a clock

22:29.367 --> 22:31.100
ticking down
the money I'm losing.

23:02.166 --> 23:04.200
I don't know why you guys
had to go on an hour's drive

23:04.266 --> 23:05.767
before we [bleep] went out.

23:10.166 --> 23:10.432
[Kris] You had people
standing around

23:10.432 --> 23:11.700
[Kris] You had people
standing around

23:11.767 --> 23:13.266
for you to [bleep] go
on a ride, dude.

23:14.767 --> 23:16.900
Well, I do.
I see the boat. I see...

23:16.967 --> 23:18.266
But you know what?
[bleep] you

23:18.266 --> 23:19.900
and your [bleep] bull-[bleep].

23:19.967 --> 23:21.700
I got a bunch
of people here.

23:24.867 --> 23:26.567
No, you [bleep],
you can't [bleep].

23:26.567 --> 23:29.000
Look, if you wanna
just stay home,

23:29.066 --> 23:30.266
you wanna just stay home?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.767
You wanna just stay home?

23:32.767 --> 23:34.467
You wanna just stay?

23:34.467 --> 23:36.600
I'm going out
with or without you.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.367
You wanted--

23:40.166 --> 23:40.432
I'm going out
with or without you.

23:40.432 --> 23:42.066
I'm going out
with or without you.

23:42.066 --> 23:43.367
Either you're getting
on this boat

23:43.367 --> 23:44.467
or I'm gonna drive away.

23:44.467 --> 23:45.467
Okay.

23:48.367 --> 23:50.166
We didn't need
to [bleep] make sure

23:50.166 --> 23:51.600
that the route was clear.

23:52.967 --> 23:53.867
Yeah, why?

24:00.567 --> 24:01.567
[Kris] Okay, well,
let's just go.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.166
[Kris] That's fine.

24:08.967 --> 24:10.000
Let's just go.

24:11.567 --> 24:12.767
Everything is cool.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.000
I'm sorry I got upset.

24:18.767 --> 24:20.400
I'm under a lot of stress

24:20.467 --> 24:22.266
trying to make this whole
[bleep] running.

24:22.266 --> 24:24.367
Everybody didn't think
I was gonna get this started,

24:24.367 --> 24:25.266
but I did.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.600
Let's go make
some [bleep] gold.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.867
Yeah. Okay, we are.

24:29.867 --> 24:32.100
James and those guys
might think I'm a drama queen

24:32.166 --> 24:33.900
bitching about
every little thing,

24:33.967 --> 24:35.266
but these guys
need to understand,

24:35.266 --> 24:37.500
we're coming down
to the end of the season.

24:37.567 --> 24:38.700
<i>After all the breakdowns,</i>

24:38.767 --> 24:39.767
<i>all the wastes of time,</i>

24:39.767 --> 24:40.432
<i>we're finally ready</i>
<i>to get gold.</i>

24:40.432 --> 24:41.700
<i>we're finally ready</i>
<i>to get gold.</i>

24:41.767 --> 24:44.600
<i>So, screwing around</i>
<i>at this point is killing me.</i>

24:44.667 --> 24:46.000
And I'm the one on the hook

24:46.066 --> 24:48.767
for a $125,000 payment,
not them!

24:50.800 --> 24:52.400
Let's get going.
We're gonna get gold.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.300
Okay, let's go.

25:03.266 --> 25:05.367
Security, security.
This is the <i>Mistress.</i>

25:05.900 --> 25:07.500
Exiting the harbor.

25:07.567 --> 25:10.200
Any concerning
or opposing traffic on 16?

25:12.500 --> 25:15.467
We have a strong
northwest wind

25:15.467 --> 25:18.300
that's causing a little bit
of a wait.

25:23.266 --> 25:25.000
I think the boat
could handle it, personally.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.100
<i>We're getting close.</i>

25:35.800 --> 25:36.867
What's the plan here?

25:37.467 --> 25:38.767
[James speaking]

25:42.667 --> 25:43.900
Okay, well, I'll stand by.

25:56.100 --> 25:56.934
[radio crackles]

25:56.967 --> 25:58.000
[James over radio]
<i>Drop the spud.</i>

26:01.600 --> 26:02.500
[Kris] Dropping!

26:09.100 --> 26:10.400
It's a little rougher
than we thought.

26:30.367 --> 26:32.166
I know it's not
any [bleep] good.

26:32.166 --> 26:33.667
[crewmember speaking]

26:33.667 --> 26:34.567
[bleep], man.

26:34.567 --> 26:36.467
I just got this [bleep]
thing fixed.

26:42.867 --> 26:45.166
Seriously, we finally
get the <i>Mistress</i> working,

26:45.166 --> 26:46.266
everything is good,

26:46.266 --> 26:47.500
we really need the hours,

26:47.500 --> 26:50.467
but these waves are more
than the <i>Mistress</i> can handle.

26:50.467 --> 26:52.300
<i>At this level,</i>

26:52.367 --> 26:54.367
<i>there's a good chance</i>
<i>I'm gonna rip the spud well.</i>

26:54.367 --> 26:56.000
And I can't afford this
right now.

26:57.066 --> 26:58.000
[bleep] this.

26:58.066 --> 26:59.567
I'm gonna [bleep]...
Pull these spuds up.

26:59.567 --> 27:00.667
Pull these spuds up.

27:06.867 --> 27:10.432
One [bleep] thing
after another

27:10.432 --> 27:10.467
One [bleep] thing
after another

27:10.467 --> 27:11.567
after another.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.300
[James] It's looking like
we should motor in.

27:19.166 --> 27:20.767
<i>It's a</i> [bleep] <i>joke.</i>

27:20.767 --> 27:22.266
-Hey, you tried.
-No, I know.

27:22.266 --> 27:24.100
But no one likes
people that try.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.600
People like people
that succeed, you know?

27:26.667 --> 27:28.567
I wanna be a succeeder,
not a tryer.

27:35.867 --> 27:37.967
<i>We go home right now.</i>

27:37.967 --> 27:40.432
<i>We're gonna be on the water</i>
<i>before the sun rises tomorrow.</i>

27:40.432 --> 27:41.400
<i>We're gonna be on the water</i>
<i>before the sun rises tomorrow.</i>

27:41.467 --> 27:43.266
<i>Like, 12 hours in the Tomcod.</i>

27:44.200 --> 27:45.400
All we can do right now

27:45.467 --> 27:47.066
is work as hard as we can

27:47.066 --> 27:48.133
and finish strong.

27:49.867 --> 27:51.767
<i>We're gonna make this work</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

27:53.867 --> 27:55.266

<i>While one Kelly heads in...</i>

27:59.900 --> 28:01.000
<i>Back in the harbor...</i>

28:02.066 --> 28:03.200
[Andy] <i>Game plan today,</i>

28:03.266 --> 28:04.200
is we're gonna go out
on the water,

28:04.266 --> 28:05.900
get on the gold,
and dredge all day.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.166
[narrator] <i>...another Kelly</i>

<i>trying to contribute</i>
<i>some much needed ounces</i>

<i>before the door</i>
<i>shuts on summer.</i>

28:16.000 --> 28:17.567
The end's coming, my friend.

28:18.166 --> 28:20.100
Very fast.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.967
I'm predicting not many
more days on the ocean.

28:22.967 --> 28:23.967
<i>Well I've got rubber pontoons</i>

28:23.967 --> 28:25.133
<i>and aluminum pontoons.</i>

28:25.133 --> 28:27.967

<i>The</i> Mistress <i>has barely</i>
<i>done anything all summer.</i>

28:30.500 --> 28:31.400
As always,

28:31.467 --> 28:32.467
Kris owes a ton of money

28:32.467 --> 28:34.400
unless we pull off a miracle.

28:34.467 --> 28:36.000
<i>So, we're getting</i>
<i>the new</i> Reaper

28:36.000 --> 28:37.667
<i>in the water to cover</i>
<i>his sorry ass.</i>

<i>A suction dredge</i>

28:41.467 --> 28:43.066
Yup. That sounds
like my brother.

28:57.867 --> 28:58.867
[Andy] Uh-oh.

29:00.967 --> 29:03.367
Just had a major malfunction
on the engine.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.467
[Andy speaking]

29:06.467 --> 29:08.500
Yeah, we're out.
That's what it is.

29:08.567 --> 29:10.432
Whenever my dad
comes on the boat...

29:10.432 --> 29:10.600
Whenever my dad
comes on the boat...

29:10.667 --> 29:12.400
I was thinking, "Oh, my God.
Give me a break."

29:12.467 --> 29:14.066
[Andy] Every time
he comes on the boat,

29:14.066 --> 29:15.000
dude something happens.

29:15.066 --> 29:15.967
[Kris] There's no gas in it?

29:15.967 --> 29:17.166
No, I thought Dad did--

29:17.166 --> 29:18.667
I mean, I'm not even
gonna say it, dude.

29:18.667 --> 29:20.800
They better not have pulled me
out here with no gas.

29:20.867 --> 29:23.567
Yeah, my dad's
something else, you know?

29:23.567 --> 29:24.867
Everything's all [bleep] up!

29:24.867 --> 29:26.600
That was all Dad, not me.

29:26.667 --> 29:28.300
Everybody blames me
for anything goes wrong.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.867
<i>The blame game.</i>

29:30.567 --> 29:32.000
Sometimes I really wonder

29:32.000 --> 29:33.400
how much money
we'd really have

29:33.467 --> 29:36.266
if my brother would stop
making these crazy deals.

29:36.266 --> 29:38.166
<i>And if my dad actually</i>
<i>gave a damn</i>

29:38.166 --> 29:39.467
<i>and did his job.</i>

29:39.467 --> 29:40.432
<i>So, again, my dad didn't</i>
<i>fill up the tank with gas.</i>

29:40.432 --> 29:42.166
<i>So, again, my dad didn't</i>
<i>fill up the tank with gas.</i>

29:42.166 --> 29:43.667
<i>That's basically his only job</i>

29:43.667 --> 29:44.867
<i>and he can't even</i>
<i>do that right.</i>

29:45.467 --> 29:47.066
So, I have a solution.

29:47.066 --> 29:48.300
Let's just drop the gear.

29:51.967 --> 29:53.500
Okay, let's get
the nozzle in, yeah?

29:53.567 --> 29:55.100
[Andy] Yep.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.367
We gotta do this right.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.500
[Brad] Ass crack over Texas!

30:05.400 --> 30:06.600
[Andy] Yeah, be prepared.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.467
You come on our boat,
you gonna see
a lot of ass.

30:08.467 --> 30:10.000
It's the Kelly way.

[Brad speaking]

33:22.500 --> 33:23.500
Ready.

33:36.767 --> 33:38.467
-I'm done.
-[Brad] What happened?

33:38.467 --> 33:39.367
I had no air.

33:40.667 --> 33:41.500
I'm done. Let's go.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.066
I'm doing my dive
and suddenly,

33:52.066 --> 33:53.100
I got no air.

33:53.166 --> 33:54.467
It's as simple as that.

33:54.467 --> 33:55.767
<i>That's some scary</i> [bleep].

33:55.767 --> 33:57.567
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>what was going on</i>

33:57.567 --> 33:59.400
<i>and I'm still not sure</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

33:59.467 --> 34:01.567
But whatever it was,
it was super messed up.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.066
When I got my head
out of that water,

34:06.066 --> 34:06.967
it was off.

34:06.967 --> 34:08.266
[Brad speaking]

34:09.266 --> 34:10.467
You think it needs oil?

34:10.467 --> 34:11.567
[Brad speaking]

34:13.166 --> 34:14.400
[Brad speaking]

34:23.100 --> 34:24.367
I don't even know
what the [bleep] happened.

34:24.367 --> 34:26.100
I came up and
the air compressor
was turned off.

34:26.166 --> 34:28.667
And they're telling me
that it was on, so...

34:28.667 --> 34:30.767
I started it.
I know it was running.

34:31.700 --> 34:33.266
Brad let the air
out of the thing,

34:33.266 --> 34:34.667
so I don't know what happened.

34:35.266 --> 34:36.600
I... If this stalled,

34:36.667 --> 34:38.667
it's so loud,
you know, like a...

34:38.667 --> 34:39.700
I don't know how
we didn't notice.

34:40.767 --> 34:41.567
How did it get shut off

34:41.600 --> 34:42.800
by the time I got
out of the water?

34:43.967 --> 34:45.997
I think they just left
the air compressor off

34:45.997 --> 34:46.066
I think they just left
the air compressor off

34:46.066 --> 34:47.266
and sent me in.

34:48.300 --> 34:50.000
Yeah, you know,
I'm backing you up.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.567
Did you really start
the compressor?

34:51.567 --> 34:53.200
I really, honestly
started the compressor.

34:53.266 --> 34:54.266
Okay...

34:54.266 --> 34:55.400
I swear on my life,
I was standing right here.

34:55.467 --> 34:56.767
-I [bleep] started it.
-Okay.

34:56.767 --> 34:59.000
And then the ladder
is not even in the water

34:59.000 --> 35:00.600
and I'm [bleep]
smacking the ladder

35:00.667 --> 35:02.000
and I'm telling
my dad, "Ladder!"

35:02.066 --> 35:05.467
I don't know where
the miscommunication was
in three feet.

35:08.266 --> 35:09.867
The air compressor
wasn't turned on

35:09.867 --> 35:10.800
when I got up,

35:10.867 --> 35:12.567
but they said it was on
when I went down.

35:13.567 --> 35:14.700
<i>I called bull</i> -[bleep].

35:14.767 --> 35:15.997
<i>But, if so, what happened?</i>

35:15.997 --> 35:16.266
<i>But, if so, what happened?</i>

35:17.100 --> 35:18.567
<i>And they didn't have</i>
<i>the ladder out</i>

35:18.567 --> 35:20.500
<i>for me to get out when</i>
<i>I was screaming at 'em.</i>

35:21.066 --> 35:22.266
Total cluster.

35:23.767 --> 35:26.000
<i>And I got no gold out of it.</i>

35:26.066 --> 35:28.000
But I'm sure as hell
not going back down

35:28.066 --> 35:29.467
with this crap being on top.

35:30.667 --> 35:32.166
Yeah, I'm done
for the day, dude.

35:32.166 --> 35:33.767
[bleep] that [bleep].

35:33.767 --> 35:35.100
I don't know if
you did or didn't,

35:35.166 --> 35:36.100
I'm just backing you up.

pretty promising

37:50.567 --> 37:52.400
when I was down on it
with a six-inch dredge,

37:52.467 --> 37:55.000

it's a game-changer.

41:58.767 --> 42:01.467
But, um, put some gold
in front of 'em,

42:01.467 --> 42:05.367
just mention gold
and they light up
like Christmas trees.

42:05.367 --> 42:08.400
Gold, gold, see?

42:09.300 --> 42:11.367
That's almost like
as good as saying

42:13.200 --> 42:14.166
[bleep]

42:17.667 --> 42:19.266

down there?

42:42.100 --> 42:43.400
[Jeff on radio]
<i>I'm doing good.</i>

42:43.467 --> 42:46.400
<i>I'm seeing some</i>

grinding hard

<i>and Jane's running things</i>
<i>smoothly up top.</i>

43:21.667 --> 43:24.367
At this point, all I'm hoping
is that we get one more day

43:24.367 --> 43:25.376
to get out before
Mother Nature cuts us off.

43:25.376 --> 43:26.967
to get out before
Mother Nature cuts us off.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.166
We're gonna check out the box
and see, like, how we did.

43:38.567 --> 43:40.867
You got my hair all messy
[bleep] undoing your rock jam.

43:40.867 --> 43:42.567
[Jeff] Oh, you-- you crawled
in the box?

43:42.567 --> 43:43.767
Can't crawl in the box.

43:45.467 --> 43:47.367
No, I wanted to
so I know how do it.

43:48.567 --> 43:49.467
Hmm, perfect.

43:52.266 --> 43:53.200
Look at that.

43:54.166 --> 43:55.376
Good job.

43:55.376 --> 43:55.800
Good job.

43:55.867 --> 43:57.467
[Emily] Nice
little gold piles.

43:57.467 --> 43:59.767
Looking good, heck yeah.

44:01.166 --> 44:02.000

for, like, what
it's trying to do.

45:05.266 --> 45:06.600
It should be burning

<i>It can be really</i>

45:20.567 --> 45:22.166
And this system is still
pretty new to me

45:22.166 --> 45:23.567

a learning curve.

differently than
it was before.

45:32.567 --> 45:35.367

to do the same [bleep] job.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
[Shem speaking]

45:51.200 --> 45:53.200

it's just not enjoyable.

45:57.867 --> 46:00.500
Uh, and-- It's not even
something I can really
work through

46:00.567 --> 46:03.000
'cause it feels
like if I tried to,

46:03.066 --> 46:06.266
I'd end up, uh, getting
real sick or something.
I don't know.

46:08.100 --> 46:10.700

hot water system dialed in.

46:16.166 --> 46:17.500

46:17.567 --> 46:18.700
[Gabe] Yeah, that might be it.

46:18.767 --> 46:20.166
Sweet.

46:20.166 --> 46:22.967
When we get it dialed in,
I'm gonna send Gabe down.

46:22.967 --> 46:25.376

46:50.100 --> 46:52.400
[Zeke] <i>I'd encourage you</i>

[Zeke] <i>I'm feeling really good</i>

47:31.867 --> 47:34.266
Honestly, this was
the plan all along.

47:34.266 --> 47:36.266
<i>I was able to go out</i>
<i>with the six inch dredge</i>

47:36.266 --> 47:39.266

<i>while Gabe got</i>
<i>the</i> Havilah <i>ready.</i>

47:41.867 --> 47:44.667
Now we're able to hit it
with a much more
sophisticated setup

47:44.667 --> 47:47.467
and just clean it all up.
I'm really stoked about this.

47:48.367 --> 47:49.367
[Gabe speaking]

47:53.166 --> 47:55.100
Yeah, you're hogging
tons of ground,

47:55.166 --> 47:55.376
there's so many rocks
coming through.

47:55.376 --> 47:56.767

it's been a tough one.

48:51.967 --> 48:53.400
This season's been tough.

48:53.467 --> 48:55.376

48:57.467 --> 49:00.767

mine until you can't
mine anymore.

49:15.767 --> 49:19.900
<i>It's that time of year</i>
<i>and our gold take</i>
<i>so far is anemic.</i>

49:19.967 --> 49:22.266

49:22.266 --> 49:24.467

that nozzle at all times.

49:33.266 --> 49:35.200
Okay, Bryan, have a good one.

49:35.266 --> 49:36.100
[Bryan] All right.

49:43.500 --> 49:45.667
Gary just had a good dive,

49:46.567 --> 49:48.000
got his time and sent

49:48.567 --> 49:49.800

as it gets around here.

there is some nice gold
down here.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.900

take the time

did we get?
-[Bryan] Six.

1:07:10.967 --> 1:07:14.166
-Let's weigh it up and see
what it came out to.
-[Bryan] There we go.

1:07:15.767 --> 1:07:18.000
That's one, two...

1:07:18.066 --> 1:07:19.000

You guys did a hell

1:07:37.967 --> 1:07:39.767
Yeah.

1:07:39.767 --> 1:07:42.266
[Vernon] <i>I feel like</i>

1:07:49.867 --> 1:07:53.700
I'm gonna yank my own chain
and say we're gonna end up
with a monster total.

1:07:53.767 --> 1:07:56.567
Anyway, all I can
tell you guys is

1:07:56.567 --> 1:07:58.266
I appreciate y'all
hanging with me.

1:08:00.266 --> 1:08:01.153
<i>All right!</i>

1:08:01.153 --> 1:08:01.266

1:08:17.367 --> 1:08:18.767
[Tony] There's just
so much of it.

1:08:18.767 --> 1:08:21.200
Another trip out,
another day on the box.

1:08:21.266 --> 1:08:23.867
I don't know how many more
of these we're gonna get
this season,

1:08:23.867 --> 1:08:26.300
but hopefully this one counted
in a big way.

1:08:27.900 --> 1:08:29.266
All right.
Let's see how we did.

1:08:30.367 --> 1:08:31.153

We've had no major problems,
no breakdowns,

nothing going wrong,
which is nice and boring

1:09:59.367 --> 1:10:01.153

1:11:47.967 --> 1:11:51.500
Hopefully we get

[Kris] What happened?

1:12:46.867 --> 1:12:48.767
Michael got his hand
hit with the spud.

1:12:58.867 --> 1:13:01.066
[Kris] <i>Of course,</i>
<i>I want to get as much gold</i>

1:13:01.066 --> 1:13:01.153

<i>I need to make this payment.</i>

1:13:02.667 --> 1:13:05.100
But when you're the captain,
the safety of every
crew member is

1:13:05.100 --> 1:13:07.100
your responsibility...

1:13:07.100 --> 1:13:08.467
<i>and Michael's hand is mangled.</i>

1:13:08.467 --> 1:13:10.867
<i>I mean, come on!</i>
<i>It got crushed by</i>
<i>a giant spud.</i>

1:13:11.867 --> 1:13:13.300
We've got to get him
to the ER.

1:13:13.367 --> 1:13:15.266
There's no way
his hand isn't broken.

1:13:15.266 --> 1:13:17.667
[James] Mining's a very
dangerous gig.

1:13:17.667 --> 1:13:20.100
Hand got caught
in the spud well,
completely crushed.

1:13:20.166 --> 1:13:21.667
We're going to the ER.

1:13:23.100 --> 1:13:26.100
I got you.
Don't touch nothing.

1:13:28.066 --> 1:13:29.266
Thank God there was
a boat close by.

1:13:29.266 --> 1:13:31.153
They were able to get Michael,
bring him to shore

1:13:31.153 --> 1:13:31.266
They were able to get Michael,
bring him to shore

1:13:31.266 --> 1:13:33.367
so he could get
the proper medical attention.

1:13:33.367 --> 1:13:34.867
Okay, watch your step.

1:13:36.867 --> 1:13:39.000
[Kris] <i>If they weren't nearby</i>
<i>and didn't offer,</i>

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.567

<i>hours to get the help</i>
<i>he needs.</i>

1:13:42.867 --> 1:13:45.900
And as bad as everything is,
we're gonna have
to keep going.

1:13:45.967 --> 1:13:47.066
We're short staffed.

1:13:47.066 --> 1:13:48.400
I just don't have any choice.

1:14:05.900 --> 1:14:07.600
[Michael]

1:14:07.667 --> 1:14:10.266
Smashed the [bleep]
out of my fingers.

1:14:10.266 --> 1:14:11.867
<i>I'm walking, though,</i>
<i>so it could've been worse.</i>

1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:18.266
Down to the bone.

1:14:26.166 --> 1:14:28.467
<i>Yeah, they're not broken.</i>
<i>They're smashed.</i>

1:14:33.500 --> 1:14:34.967
[Gabe] <i>None of the other</i>
<i>dredges are going out,</i>

1:14:34.967 --> 1:14:37.300
<i>but nobody else's</i>
<i>decision should be</i>
<i>a part of the equation</i>

1:14:37.367 --> 1:14:40.567
You should be, you know,
making your own calls
about everything.

1:14:40.567 --> 1:14:42.100
You know, it's like
an indicator.

1:14:42.100 --> 1:14:45.266
You kind of look at it
and, like, add it to the list.

1:14:45.266 --> 1:14:46.600
There's always
that miner thing

1:14:46.667 --> 1:14:48.300
where they're like,
everyone's kind of like,

1:14:48.367 --> 1:14:49.700
<i>around the port.</i>

1:14:49.700 --> 1:14:51.367
<i>They're like,</i>
<i>"What are the other miners</i>
<i>doing?"</i>

1:14:51.367 --> 1:14:53.900
And then somebody is like,
"[bleep] it," and pulls
their boat out

1:14:53.967 --> 1:14:54.900
and everyone's like,
"[bleep]!"

1:14:56.367 --> 1:14:58.200
[laughing] Everyone
gets in their boat.

1:14:58.266 --> 1:15:01.367
-[yells] Charge!
-[bleep].

<i>a</i> [bleep] <i>couple of days.</i>

1:15:12.667 --> 1:15:15.100

1:15:15.100 --> 1:15:18.567

rollercoaster ride all year.

1:17:50.266 --> 1:17:51.800
so let's see how we did.

1:17:56.967 --> 1:17:58.166
Let's weigh this [bleep] up.

1:17:59.567 --> 1:18:02.567
Hoping for 300,
but let's see where we're at.

1:18:05.767 --> 1:18:07.100
There's 30.

1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000
50, 60...

1:18:11.867 --> 1:18:12.900
70...

1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:16.800
Triple digits.

1:18:16.867 --> 1:18:18.800
Might hit
a few hundred ounces.

1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:26.467
204. Good gold.

1:18:27.767 --> 1:18:32.200
[narrator] <i>204 ounces is worth</i>
<i>over $367,000,</i>

1:18:32.266 --> 1:18:35.033
<i>by far the</i> Myrtle Irene's
<i>biggest haul of the season.</i>

1:18:35.033 --> 1:18:35.600
<i>by far the</i> Myrtle Irene's
<i>biggest haul of the season.</i>

1:18:37.367 --> 1:18:40.200
[Shawn] <i>Now we've finally</i>
<i>got all the bugs worked out</i>
<i>of the</i> Myrtle,

1:18:40.266 --> 1:18:43.300
looks like everything's
working just fine.

1:18:43.367 --> 1:18:47.066
She's getting better
and better every clean up.

1:18:47.867 --> 1:18:50.100
And the weather is
cooperating.

1:18:50.100 --> 1:18:52.667
That's all we need.
We need days on the water.

1:18:52.667 --> 1:18:55.667
We need equipment to run
and not break down.

1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.800
The <i>Myrtle's</i> dialed in.
The little boats are fixed...

1:19:01.667 --> 1:19:03.500
and we're on
some fantastic ground.

1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:05.033
<i>All the little problems</i>
<i>from this season have</i>
<i>kept gold out of our pockets.</i>

1:19:05.033 --> 1:19:07.600
<i>All the little problems</i>
<i>from this season have</i>
<i>kept gold out of our pockets.</i>

1:19:07.667 --> 1:19:10.300
<i>I'm hoping we have</i>
<i>one run left.</i>

1:19:10.367 --> 1:19:12.266
We just need the weather
to hold out

1:19:12.266 --> 1:19:14.200
and let us be out there
as long as possible.

1:19:15.100 --> 1:19:16.467
Season's wrapping up.

1:19:16.467 --> 1:19:18.700
You better get it done
while you can.

1:19:18.767 --> 1:19:21.100
Really good <i>Myrtle</i> clean up.

1:19:21.166 --> 1:19:24.000
We'll put this away,
get the hell out of here.

1:19:28.100 --> 1:19:29.400
[narrator] <i>On the other side</i>
<i>of Nome...</i>

1:19:35.700 --> 1:19:37.667
[Kris] <i>It's, like, 30 hours,</i>

1:19:37.667 --> 1:19:38.767
but they were [bleep] up.

1:19:38.767 --> 1:19:41.867
You know, I'm so sick
of my excuses this year.

1:19:41.867 --> 1:19:43.867
I'm sorry I got you
into this [bleep], Kevin.

1:19:43.867 --> 1:19:46.967
I swear to God, I thought
we were going to kill it
this year, buddy.

1:19:46.967 --> 1:19:50.867
[narrator] <i>...Kris' money man,</i>
<i>Kevin O'Damey, is back</i>
<i>in town</i>

1:19:50.867 --> 1:19:53.567
<i>just in time for</i>
<i>the team's clean out...</i>

1:19:53.567 --> 1:19:55.767
<i>upping the pressure</i>
<i>on the beleaguered captain.</i>

1:19:57.200 --> 1:19:58.867
[Kris] I'm really hoping
for 30 ounces.

1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:02.100
Come on, you [bleep]. Pay me.

1:20:03.700 --> 1:20:05.033
<i>I already started to get</i>
<i>gold piling up in here.</i>

1:20:05.033 --> 1:20:06.266
<i>I already started to get</i>
<i>gold piling up in here.</i>

1:20:07.867 --> 1:20:10.600
If you look at all
the problems that I had
over the last week

1:20:10.667 --> 1:20:11.634
to get this gold,

1:20:11.634 --> 1:20:14.200
Mike got hurt,
generator kept turning off.

1:20:14.266 --> 1:20:17.000
I had to do a bunch
of repairs on the boat
to get it up and running.

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.200
It feels like it was a month.

1:20:18.200 --> 1:20:20.800
You know? Like,
I went through a month
of [bleep].

1:20:20.867 --> 1:20:22.600
Every time I turn around,
it's just--

1:20:22.667 --> 1:20:24.800
It's one thing after another.
We went through
a lot of crap this year.

1:20:24.867 --> 1:20:27.800
We buttoned up
a lot of crap this year.

1:20:27.867 --> 1:20:31.100
[Kris] <i>Let's be honest.</i>
<i>This season has been</i>
<i>a dumpster fire.</i>

1:20:31.166 --> 1:20:34.767
And to make things worse,
I bring my buddy Kevin in
to help bankroll this thing.

1:20:34.767 --> 1:20:35.033
Now he's standing
over my shoulder,

1:20:35.033 --> 1:20:36.667
Now he's standing
over my shoulder,

1:20:36.667 --> 1:20:38.367
<i>hoping I make this work.</i>

1:20:38.367 --> 1:20:42.100
Look, I believe that
if everything starts
to go right,

1:20:42.166 --> 1:20:44.367
I can make
the Reaper Nation huge.

1:20:44.367 --> 1:20:47.266
<i>But the clock is pretty much</i>
<i>striking midnight on us</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

1:20:48.166 --> 1:20:50.767
I need a giant clean out
like never before.

1:20:52.867 --> 1:20:55.800
Best cleanup of the year,
no matter what happens.

1:20:55.867 --> 1:20:56.767
Here we go.

1:20:59.867 --> 1:21:01.300
Come on, baby.

1:21:01.367 --> 1:21:02.266
Two...

1:21:02.867 --> 1:21:04.567
three and a half, four...

1:21:05.266 --> 1:21:06.166
five, six...

1:21:07.266 --> 1:21:09.600
seven, eight...

1:21:15.367 --> 1:21:17.000
9.54.

1:21:23.367 --> 1:21:26.767
[narrator] <i>9.54 ounces is</i>
<i>worth over $17,000,</i>

1:21:26.767 --> 1:21:29.667
<i>one of Reaper Nation's</i>
<i>biggest hauls to date...</i>

1:21:29.667 --> 1:21:33.667
<i>but it only gets him</i>
<i>about halfway</i>
<i>to where they need to be</i>

1:21:33.667 --> 1:21:35.033
<i>to make their big payment.</i>

1:21:35.033 --> 1:21:35.066
<i>to make their big payment.</i>

1:21:36.567 --> 1:21:37.600
I'm sad as [bleep].

1:21:37.667 --> 1:21:39.100
I thought we were
gonna do better.

1:21:39.100 --> 1:21:41.300
It's not over for me yet.

1:21:41.367 --> 1:21:44.100
You know what?
Stubbornness will prevail.

1:21:44.166 --> 1:21:47.467
You know? And I'm desperate.
I need that money and we're
gonna make it happen.

1:21:48.500 --> 1:21:50.000
<i>So, here's my lemon's take.</i>

1:21:50.066 --> 1:21:51.667
Time is almost up this summer.

1:21:51.667 --> 1:21:55.567
We still have
a lot of payments to make
to keep this operation going.

1:21:55.567 --> 1:21:57.066
<i>But here's my lemonade take.</i>

1:21:57.066 --> 1:21:59.266
<i>It looks bleak,</i>
<i>but it's not over yet.</i>

1:21:59.266 --> 1:22:01.600
<i>We're on the best gold</i>
<i>of the season.</i>

1:22:01.667 --> 1:22:03.867
The <i>Mistress</i> is working great
and I'm willing to pull

1:22:03.867 --> 1:22:05.033
the longest marathon ever
to get what we need.

1:22:05.033 --> 1:22:06.667
the longest marathon ever
to get what we need.

1:22:06.667 --> 1:22:08.400
[bleep], man. I'm bummed.

1:22:08.467 --> 1:22:10.100
[Kevin] At the end of the day,
we learned a lot

1:22:10.166 --> 1:22:11.600
and we've got to take
this experience

1:22:11.667 --> 1:22:14.667
and use it
to our knowledge
and knowledge is gold.

1:22:14.667 --> 1:22:17.400
[Kris] <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>Well, I learned so much,</i>
<i>I should be a billionaire.</i>

1:22:21.166 --> 1:22:23.266
[narrator] <i>As the fleet</i>
<i>enters the homestretch...</i>

1:22:24.867 --> 1:22:29.367
<i>it'll be a mad dash</i>
<i>to hit season goals</i>

1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:33.700
<i>Next time on</i>
Bering Sea Gold...

1:22:33.767 --> 1:22:35.033
Time is getting short
and the gold is
getting cold.

1:22:35.033 --> 1:22:37.367
Time is getting short
and the gold is
getting cold.

1:22:37.367 --> 1:22:38.467
Yeah, boy!

1:22:38.467 --> 1:22:40.000
[yells happily]

1:22:40.066 --> 1:22:41.867
Get down there!

1:22:41.867 --> 1:22:44.400
[Shawn] <i>Now it's time</i>
<i>to just pile up the gold.</i>

1:22:44.467 --> 1:22:47.100
We're gonna smash it
right out of the park.

1:22:48.467 --> 1:22:50.500
[whistles]

1:22:50.567 --> 1:22:52.667
It's past midnight now,
so we're all just--

1:22:52.667 --> 1:22:54.000
-[machinery bangs]
-[camera man] What was that?

1:22:54.667 --> 1:22:56.100
[man screaming]

1:22:56.100 --> 1:22:58.900
Get a hammer
and bang on that bitch,
bust all that [bleep] loose.

1:22:58.967 --> 1:23:01.300
We've just wasted
a whole bunch of
[bleep] time here.

1:23:01.367 --> 1:23:03.367
[man yelling] No!
No, stop the motor!

1:23:03.367 --> 1:23:04.367
What the [bleep]?

1:23:04.367 --> 1:23:05.033
<i>Emily, we're falling apart</i>
<i>without you.</i>

1:23:05.033 --> 1:23:05.467
<i>Emily, we're falling apart</i>
<i>without you.</i>

1:23:07.667 --> 1:23:10.767
We finished strong.
Let's see what we got.

1:23:10.767 --> 1:23:12.100
[yelling] Yeah, baby!

1:23:12.100 --> 1:23:12.867
[Emily] Oh, my God.

1:23:12.867 --> 1:23:14.100
[yelling happily]

1:23:14.100 --> 1:23:17.066
Losers get nothing!
I want my million
[bleep] dollars!
