WEBVTT

01:10.037 --> 01:11.972
- 20 acts
ready to battle it out

01:11.972 --> 01:14.441
for just seven spots
in the live shows.

01:14.441 --> 01:18.645
Judge Cut."

01:18.645 --> 01:20.047
- It's a really tough day,

01:20.047 --> 01:21.648
because we're going to see
20 amazing acts,

01:21.648 --> 01:24.918
but only seven of those will
move forward to the live shows.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.154
I'm gonna really fight
for the ones that I love.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.000
- I love you so much.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.724
- I love you so much.

01:30.724 --> 01:31.992
Can I touch you?

01:31.992 --> 01:33.427
- Oh, can he--
can I--Simon.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.031
- So who's arrived so far?

01:38.031 --> 01:40.534
Everyone except Howie.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.869
- I can't tell you how excited

01:42.869 --> 01:44.438
I am that you're on the show.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.306
George Lopez.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.041
- Howie Mandel,
it's already impressive

01:48.041 --> 01:49.309
just being
on "America's Got Talent,"

01:49.309 --> 01:50.677
and then knowing you're there,

01:50.677 --> 01:52.512
it's like having a brother
at the corner--the hot corner.

01:52.512 --> 01:53.981
- Two comics.
It's great to be com--

01:53.981 --> 01:54.982
And you know what?
- Ooh.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.249
- Ooh, sorry.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.953
Look out for traffic.
Driving is not my thing.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.000
- Where's Howie?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.355
- Where's Howie?

02:01.355 --> 02:03.323
- Oh, my God.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.726
Could you go around?

02:05.726 --> 02:07.494
No, no, no, no. No, no.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.063
No, I need to--
I'm sorry.

02:10.063 --> 02:11.198
- Almost.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.432
- All right. Sorry about that.

02:12.432 --> 02:13.433
All right. Hold it.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.668
Whoa, sorry.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.536
We'll get you there.
This will be fun.

02:16.536 --> 02:17.871
- So we don't know
where Howie is...

02:17.871 --> 02:19.740
- And we got to go soon.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.041
Show's about to start.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.342
- Oh, they're screaming.

02:22.342 --> 02:23.710
You know what?
Don't even get out.

02:23.710 --> 02:24.911
- Okay.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.155
- How do you feel about it?
- It's gonna be tough.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.189
- It's gonna be tough.

02:36.189 --> 02:38.091
Okay, let's head in.

04:45.418 --> 04:49.790
getting three yeses was amazing.

I can't honestly say that I've

07:00.687 --> 07:03.556

before.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.358
I've never been able
to make a dog do anything

07:05.358 --> 07:06.493
without a half a hot dog,

07:06.493 --> 07:08.762
so I was impressed.

07:08.762 --> 07:13.133

really fantastic.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.336
And you rose to the occasion.
I think it's great.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.608

07:21.608 --> 07:24.444
the make-or-break, whether you
go through to the next round.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.714
You guys are cute,
and you are adorable,

07:27.714 --> 07:30.000

07:30.000 --> 07:30.750
but we've only got 7 spots

07:30.750 --> 07:33.219
I'm not sure
if cute and adorable is

07:33.219 --> 07:35.088
that good enough--
I have to be honest.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.523
- Wow.

07:36.523 --> 07:37.791
- Last time we saw you,

07:37.791 --> 07:39.926
I was the only one on the panel
that gave you a no.

07:39.926 --> 07:41.461
Everyone gave you a yes.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.064
I do think it's really cute
what you can do with your dog.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.566
It's incredible.
But it does get repetitive.

07:46.566 --> 07:47.968
- I don't think you're

07:47.968 --> 07:49.669
giving them enough credit,
Heidi.

What's your name?

08:43.890 --> 08:45.058
- Daniel.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.693
My name is Daniel Joiner.
I am 17,

08:46.693 --> 08:49.129
and I'm from Alamo, Tennessee.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.031
It's the cliché small town,

08:51.031 --> 08:54.567
and my dad's the music minister
of our church,

08:54.567 --> 08:57.670
and so I grew up singing
in kids' choir.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.773
- Oh, we always knew
Daniel could sing.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.442
From when he was
a little bitty fella,

09:02.442 --> 09:03.843
he was always singing.

09:03.843 --> 09:06.079
- I decided to audition
for "America's Got Talent"

09:06.079 --> 09:07.917
because it's
about living the dream.

09:07.917 --> 09:08.948
because it's
about living the dream.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.818
But coming from little tiny
Alamo

09:11.818 --> 09:15.288
to this gigantic city
that is Los Angeles,

09:15.288 --> 09:17.924
performing
in front of 3,000 plus people...

09:19.692 --> 09:21.461
it was just mind-blowing.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.633
- We love your voice.
- Thank you.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.268
- You're a really nice guy.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.970
It's all a little bit
too perfect at the moment.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.139
- You seemed a little stiff
and a little nervous.

09:33.139 --> 09:36.543
- A little?
- And let loose a little bit.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.415
- I've been practicing
my stage presence

09:42.415 --> 09:46.386
to loosen up and not be
such a goody two-shoes nice guy.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.956
Here's my one big chance
to make the live shows.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.458
Here I am.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.559
I'm ready to entertain.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.697
- Daniel, how are you?
- I'm very well.

09:57.697 --> 09:58.731

09:58.731 --> 09:59.732
- Very well. Thank you.

09:59.732 --> 10:00.733
How old are you again?

10:00.733 --> 10:03.236
- I'm 17 years old.
- Okay.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.404
- Whoo!

10:04.404 --> 10:06.172
- So how did you enjoy
the first audition?

10:06.172 --> 10:07.540
What did you pick up?

10:07.540 --> 10:07.917
- Well, I took y'all's comments
about originality

10:07.917 --> 10:09.876
- Well, I took y'all's comments
about originality

10:09.876 --> 10:11.244
and being more me,

10:11.244 --> 10:13.146

and buckled down

10:13.146 --> 10:14.314
and worked hard with that.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.882
- And is that
when you grew a beard?

10:17.217 --> 10:20.053
- Would you say that I
influenced that in any way?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.254
- Oh, damn.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.022
- Whoo!

12:03.022 --> 12:07.917
- ♪ I feel so good ♪

12:07.917 --> 12:10.330
- ♪ I feel so good ♪

12:11.531 --> 12:13.366
Whoa!

12:20.240 --> 12:21.808
- The crowd is going crazy
for him.

12:27.947 --> 12:30.617
- Okay, Daniel.

12:30.617 --> 12:34.187
- Well, well, well, Daniel.
- Wow.

12:34.187 --> 12:37.590
- I mean, my comments to you
last time were

12:37.590 --> 12:37.917
it was too uptight,
you were too technical...

12:37.917 --> 12:41.394
it was too uptight,
you were too technical...

12:41.394 --> 12:44.097
man, have you had a switcheroo.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.599
Oh, my gosh!

12:46.599 --> 12:49.002
- Thank you so much.
- It's like you let out

12:49.002 --> 12:53.640
this inner kind of feisty.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.907
I loved it.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.146
- Thank you so much.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.982
- You took cheesiness
to another level.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.118
No, no, but I mean this
in a positive way.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.919
- It wasn't cheesy.
- No, no, no, but it made me--

13:06.919 --> 13:07.917
- That was not cheesy.
- At the end of a verse,

13:07.917 --> 13:08.688
- That was not cheesy.
- At the end of a verse,

13:08.688 --> 13:10.023
whoo.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.925
You made it your own,
and I kind of liked the...

13:12.925 --> 13:15.461
- No, listen, listen, listen.
- I don't want to hear you.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.563
- That was hot.

13:17.563 --> 13:18.898
That wasn't cheesy.

13:18.898 --> 13:19.999
- Ooh.
- That was hot.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.868
- Whoo!

13:23.303 --> 13:25.204
- You know, I thought
about saying this to Simon,

13:25.204 --> 13:26.239
but I'm gonna say it to you:

13:26.239 --> 13:27.940
you have eyes that are
captivating.

13:30.243 --> 13:34.480
And he says cheesy.
I say showmanship.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.683
- I say hot.
- There's showmanship.

13:36.683 --> 13:37.917
And hot.
- And hot!

13:37.917 --> 13:38.718
And hot.
- And hot!

13:38.718 --> 13:39.819
- Thank you.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.056
- I'm telling you,
it's the beard.

13:43.056 --> 13:46.526
- What you showed today was
real confidence.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.694
- Thank you so much.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.462
- You're someone
who you're gonna remember,

13:49.462 --> 13:52.231
because you just don't expect
you to do what you did.

13:52.231 --> 13:55.668
And I still believe it's
the tip of the iceberg with you.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.204
I think we can do something
really special here.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.305
- Thank you.

14:04.043 --> 14:07.580
- Took it
to a whole different level.

14:07.580 --> 14:07.917
- He did try harder today.

14:07.917 --> 14:09.649
- He did try harder today.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.717
- Yes, he did.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.821
- Hey, "AGT" fans.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.990
Channel your inner Simon,
Mel B, Howie, and Heidi

14:17.990 --> 14:19.525
by pressing your judge's buzzer

14:19.525 --> 14:22.795
and customizing your favorite
judge's catch phrase

14:22.795 --> 14:25.031
with the "AGT" official app.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.265
All you got to do
to download it

14:26.265 --> 14:28.801
is go to the App Store
or Google Play now.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.378
- To get that Golden Buzzer...
- Oh, my God,

14:38.378 --> 14:41.314
going straight
to the live round.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.549
- This is
a million-dollar moment,

14:43.549 --> 14:45.852
so give it a million percent,
okay?

14:45.852 --> 14:47.420
- Okay.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.655
- Oh, I like these guys too.

14:49.655 --> 14:52.158
- Hi, Ilan and Josh.
- Hello.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.427
- It really surprised me
the first time I met you.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.729
- Yeah, well, we have some more
surprises up our sleeve, so...

14:56.729 --> 14:58.364
- Well, good luck, you guys.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.346
- I thought the first time we
saw you was kind of interesting.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.982
I think a lot of people have
got better.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.417
I think you've got worse.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.752
- Oh, what?
- All right. Thanks, guys.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.287
- I still believe in you guys.

15:21.287 --> 15:22.822
- I do.
- I really do.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.257
- Terrible.
- You guys should have

15:24.257 --> 15:25.658
heard them the first time
around.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.126
- They were really good.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.962
- So they are comparing, like,
round one to round two.

15:29.962 --> 15:30.997
- Here we go, gang.

15:33.699 --> 15:37.203
- So welcome back,
The Finest Family.

15:37.203 --> 15:40.273
What's gonna keep us
from saying no to you?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.809
- Creativity, originality,

15:42.809 --> 15:44.410
and to be able to do this
together on a stage,

15:44.410 --> 15:45.945
I think it's important.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.413
- Well, The Finest Family,

15:47.413 --> 15:49.215
I wish you good luck.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.231
- Finest Family.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.769
- I think there's
a really good idea here,

16:09.769 --> 16:11.838
but this wasn't as good
as your first audition,

16:11.838 --> 16:13.072
in my opinion.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.441
You need a lot more dancers
onstage with you

16:15.441 --> 16:16.476
for this to work.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.977
It needs to be thought through.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.979
So I'm kind of 50/50
at the moment.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.216
- We have 20 acts today.
7 are going forward.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.151
Gonna be tough today.
Very tough.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.654
- I think they could be great.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.723
- We have a lot of great,
you know,

16:30.723 --> 16:32.425
and so few spots.

16:32.425 --> 16:32.939
- Hopefully he likes
funny magic.

16:32.939 --> 16:34.260
- Hopefully he likes
funny magic.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.229
- Hopefully, for your sake.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.097
- My name is Blake Vogt,

16:38.097 --> 16:40.766
and I am a magician.

16:40.766 --> 16:43.269
When I was eight years old,
I saw a local magician

16:43.269 --> 16:45.771
performing
at a pizza restaurant.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.940
I loved the idea
of figuring it out,

16:47.940 --> 16:51.143
and the reactions he got
from people.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.846
I became obsessed with magic
after that.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.618
Growing up, I used to practice
magic on my brother,

16:58.618 --> 17:00.653
and because he'd seen me do
so much magic,

17:00.653 --> 17:02.939
he eventually started
charging me $1

17:02.939 --> 17:03.022
he eventually started
charging me $1

17:03.022 --> 17:05.691
every time he would agree
to watch me.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.026
So now it's all flipped.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.995
Now people will hopefully pay
to see me,

17:08.995 --> 17:12.365
and I can stop paying them
to watch me do magic.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.534
Almond oil, bees,
and cuttlefish.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.470
If I said your allergy,
please sit down.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.005
One, two, three. Yes!

17:21.474 --> 17:24.310
- You're kind of psychic,
mind reader, you're a magician.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.444
You're very impressive.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.813
- I am gonna remember you.
- Boom.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.939
- It was a huge victory
to impress the four judges,

17:32.939 --> 17:33.352
- It was a huge victory
to impress the four judges,

17:33.352 --> 17:36.455
and I want to impress them
again,

17:36.455 --> 17:38.591
and so I know I have to step up
my game

17:38.591 --> 17:41.294
to rise to that level.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.628
I've been dreaming
of this chance

17:42.628 --> 17:44.297
since I was eight years old,

17:44.297 --> 17:46.599
and this is my shot.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.203
- I like that guy.

17:51.203 --> 17:52.905
He's good.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.473
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.209
- So tell us,
since the last time we saw you,

17:57.209 --> 18:00.046
have you been preparing
to step up your act?

18:00.046 --> 18:02.081
- I've been preparing
some magic for you guys

18:02.081 --> 18:02.939
that's never been done before.

18:02.939 --> 18:03.249
that's never been done before.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.617
- Wow.
- Oh, wow.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.586
- Yep. And it's gonna happen
down there at the desk,

18:06.586 --> 18:07.620
so can I come down there?

18:07.620 --> 18:08.654
- Yeah.
- All right. Cool.

18:13.059 --> 18:16.262
Up close and personal.
Hello, hello.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.465
So this evening, I've prepared
a magic trick for you guys

18:19.465 --> 18:20.800
involving money.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.335
But I'm gonna need
to borrow some cash,

18:22.335 --> 18:24.704
so do any of you have
some bills on you?

18:24.704 --> 18:25.705
- What do you need?
- Maybe Howie?

18:25.705 --> 18:26.806
- I need two bills.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.841
If they could be
widely different,

18:28.841 --> 18:31.377
so, like--oh, yeah,
$100 would be great.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.939
- You have $100?
- And then what's the lowest

18:32.939 --> 18:32.945
- You have $100?
- And then what's the lowest

18:32.945 --> 18:34.080
bill you have, Howie?

18:34.080 --> 18:35.715
- I have dollars.
- That's amazing.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.016
So I'm gonna be using

18:37.016 --> 18:38.417
these two bills.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.586
What I have with me are
two markers.

18:40.586 --> 18:43.222
Place your initials on the face.

18:43.222 --> 18:44.857
That way,
we know they're unique bills,

18:44.857 --> 18:46.993
and and there's no other bills
like it in the world.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.694
Perfect.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.029
Grab right here onto the edge.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.732
I'm actually gonna bend
the corner back,

18:52.732 --> 18:55.067
and I'm going to tear it.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.636
And I don't want to do it
all the way,

18:56.636 --> 18:58.004
so with your other hand,
if you don't mind,

18:58.004 --> 19:01.507
Mel, grab right here
and tear it off.

19:01.507 --> 19:02.939
Now, George.

19:02.939 --> 19:03.542
Now, George.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.078
Your $100--unfortunately,
we're gonna do the same thing.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.313
- Uh... oh.
- Okay?

19:07.313 --> 19:09.915
This is a little bit
more high stakes, right?

19:09.915 --> 19:11.283
Now, I don't want
to be held responsible

19:11.283 --> 19:12.818
if this doesn't work,
so if you don't mind...

19:12.818 --> 19:14.186
- Oh, thanks.
- Tear it off.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.523
George did that.
I didn't do it. Okay? Perfect.

19:17.523 --> 19:20.026
This is where the magic takes
an interesting turn.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.228
Watch. Watch.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.829
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.771
Ready?

19:31.771 --> 19:32.939
Ta-da!

19:32.939 --> 19:33.039
Ta-da!

19:33.039 --> 19:34.840
What I'm about to do next,

19:34.840 --> 19:36.776
I promise you,
no one has ever done before

19:36.776 --> 19:37.977
in the history of magic.

19:39.645 --> 19:40.980
So watch close.

19:49.755 --> 19:52.391
- What?

19:52.391 --> 19:53.993
- Check them out.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.528
The 1 is now on the 100,

19:55.528 --> 19:56.796
and the 100 is now the 1.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.130
You can pull on them,
make sure they're not

19:58.130 --> 19:59.532
just balanced on there.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.766
They're permanently on there,

20:00.766 --> 20:02.368
and you guys can keep
those bills.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.207
- Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.642
- Look at this. I'm showing you.
- Thank you.

20:09.642 --> 20:10.743
Thank you.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.880
- How did you do that?
- Magic.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.549
Magic.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.250
- That's amazing.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.353
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, man, this is--

20:21.353 --> 20:24.056
- Wow.
- Is it still good, though?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.593
It really is unbelievable.
I mean, you know,

20:27.593 --> 20:29.662
you had your sleeves rolled up,
you know.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.497
I was looking at your hands
the whole time.

20:31.497 --> 20:32.939
That is attached.
- It is attached.

20:32.939 --> 20:34.233
That is attached.
- It is attached.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.801
- I'm speechless.
I don't even know

20:35.801 --> 20:37.737
what to say about this.
- Thank you.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.338
- You delivered
exactly what you said.

20:39.338 --> 20:42.508
You ate it. You regurgitated it.
You attached it.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.776
It disappeared.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.045
That is truly magic.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.046
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.447
- Thank you.

20:48.447 --> 20:53.219
- I just love that you think
of your own original magic.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.954
And I remember the last time
when you were here,

20:54.954 --> 20:56.989
you read my mind--
I mean, no one knew.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.357
- This is ten times better
than that.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.192
You stepped it up.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.939
- That was a great,
great second audition.

21:02.939 --> 21:03.529
- That was a great,
great second audition.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.631
- Thank you. Thank you.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.235
Thank you.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.036
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.171
Thank you.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.643
Thank you!

21:17.643 --> 21:18.811
- I've never seen that.

21:18.811 --> 21:19.945
- I have never seen that.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.380
- I've never seen that before.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.715
- You've got a huge smile
on your face.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.216
- Yeah. I'm really excited.

43:51.696 --> 43:53.998
It's about being remembered.

43:55.933 --> 43:58.703
I like people in shows like this
to want to win,

43:58.703 --> 44:01.806
and I think you came out tonight
and showed fighting spirit,

44:01.806 --> 44:03.274
so good for you.

44:03.274 --> 44:04.876
- I'll take it.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.613
- Okay, well,
thank you very much.

44:08.613 --> 44:09.847
- Thank you, guys.
- Congratulations.

44:09.847 --> 44:10.848
- Thank you.
- Bye.

44:14.719 --> 44:16.621
- Today is gonna be tough.

44:25.930 --> 44:27.999
- The chainsaw of death.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.369
- I can't.

44:31.369 --> 44:32.837
- Could you die tonight?
- There's a good chance

44:32.837 --> 44:34.172
I wouldn't walk off the stage.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.075
- Only seven acts are gonna
go through.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.878
- It was just so magical.

44:50.755 --> 44:52.723
- You guys are so handsome.

44:52.723 --> 44:54.992
- ♪ I work out
when I walk in the spot, yeah ♪

44:54.992 --> 44:56.527
- You're good-looking.
You're good-looking.

45:01.265 --> 45:03.134
- ♪ Show it, show it,
show it, show it ♪

45:04.202 --> 45:05.603
- ♪ I'm sexy and I know it ♪

45:06.737 --> 45:08.940
Ohh!

45:08.940 --> 45:09.941
- Girl...

45:11.242 --> 45:13.144
- ♪ I'm sexy and I know it ♪

45:13.144 --> 45:15.746
- Oh, wow.
Take a look at that.

45:15.746 --> 45:16.951
- Yeah, every lady in the
building is on their feet.

45:16.951 --> 45:19.617
- Yeah, every lady in the
building is on their feet.

45:19.617 --> 45:22.086
- This is a family show,

45:22.086 --> 45:24.522
but I didn't mind it.

45:24.522 --> 45:26.457
- You might be really surprised
to hear this,

45:26.457 --> 45:29.493
but I really liked it.

45:29.493 --> 45:31.829
- This guy could be competition
for us, huh?

45:31.829 --> 45:34.932
- Wow, he's good.
He is good.

45:34.932 --> 45:36.901
- ♪ I work out ♪

45:36.901 --> 45:38.135
- You took the ladies
away from us, man.

45:38.135 --> 45:39.637
No, come on.

45:43.841 --> 45:45.376
- ♪ Everybody stops ♪

45:45.376 --> 45:46.911

45:51.115 --> 45:54.719
I love these guys.
I love these guys.

45:54.719 --> 45:56.787
This is great.

45:56.787 --> 45:58.923
- Hi, guys.
- Hola.

45:58.923 --> 46:01.158
- Welcome back.
- It's good to be back.

46:01.158 --> 46:02.760
- Did you enjoy
the first audition?

46:02.760 --> 46:04.395
- Oh, we loved
the first audition.

46:04.395 --> 46:05.563
- Tell the audience
where you're from.

46:05.563 --> 46:07.164
- We're from Argentina.

46:07.164 --> 46:09.066
Pretty far outside
of Buenos Aires.

46:09.066 --> 46:11.836
And a lot of us are from
pretty dangerous neighborhoods,

46:11.836 --> 46:12.837
kind of poor neighborhoods.

46:15.373 --> 46:16.741
We've known each other
all our lives.

46:16.741 --> 46:16.951
We've been dancing
since we were about this big.

46:16.951 --> 46:20.144
We've been dancing
since we were about this big.

46:20.144 --> 46:21.612
We grew up in a lot of poverty.

46:21.612 --> 46:24.315
Some of us even
with our brothers and sisters,

46:24.315 --> 46:26.817
six, seven people
in one little bedroom like this.

46:26.817 --> 46:30.221
Don't even have electricity,
don't have water.

46:30.221 --> 46:33.758
You know, sometimes you don't
even have anything to eat.

46:33.758 --> 46:37.461
For a lot of us, dancing was
a way to get off the streets.

46:37.461 --> 46:38.829
Every night,
you go to sleep thinking

46:38.829 --> 46:40.097
about what you're gonna do
the next day,

46:40.097 --> 46:41.832
and, you know,
dreaming about being onstage

46:41.832 --> 46:44.335
and getting paid to do something
that you love to do.

46:46.737 --> 46:46.951
Without dance, I'm not sure
where we would be.

46:46.951 --> 46:50.941
Without dance, I'm not sure
where we would be.

46:50.941 --> 46:53.311
We'd probably be in jail
or doing drugs,

46:53.311 --> 46:56.013
maybe even dead.

46:56.013 --> 46:59.050
This dance actually gave us hope

46:59.050 --> 47:00.451
just to get out.

47:00.451 --> 47:02.019
We're gonna do it perfect today.

47:02.019 --> 47:03.621
Otherwise, we go home.

47:06.123 --> 47:09.093
We feel like brothers.
We're all in this together.

47:09.093 --> 47:12.196
Since the audition,
a lot of us quit our day jobs.

47:12.196 --> 47:13.531
Everything is
riding on this now.

47:13.531 --> 47:14.865
Our families are depending
on us,

47:14.865 --> 47:16.951
and um, this--

47:16.951 --> 47:18.035
and um, this--

47:18.035 --> 47:19.870
- Right?

47:29.747 --> 47:32.683
- And what would it mean
winning this show for you guys?

47:32.683 --> 47:36.187
- Oh, oh--
it would change our lives,

47:36.187 --> 47:38.889
completely change our lives,
our families' lives.

47:45.696 --> 47:46.951
- Out of tonight, only seven
acts are gonna go through,

47:46.951 --> 47:49.900
- Out of tonight, only seven
acts are gonna go through,

47:49.900 --> 47:51.836
so you're gonna step this up
now, yeah?

47:51.836 --> 47:53.270
- Yes.
- Okay, well, look,

47:53.270 --> 47:54.605
two minutes can
change your life.

47:54.605 --> 47:56.340
Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

48:09.019 --> 48:10.388
- I hope it's
as good as last time.

49:29.533 --> 49:31.469
I love this.

49:35.873 --> 49:37.074
Yes, yes, yes!

49:37.074 --> 49:39.610
- All the judges
on their feet!

49:49.653 --> 49:51.288
- Mel?

49:51.288 --> 49:53.991
- I don't think I've ever seen
anything like this before.

49:53.991 --> 49:57.161
The power coming from
off the stage--

49:57.161 --> 50:00.364
There's 8 of you. It felt like
there was 800 of you.

50:00.364 --> 50:02.733
I was sitting here going...

50:02.733 --> 50:05.302
- You were. She was.
- Screaming. It was that good.

50:05.302 --> 50:07.872
Words can't even describe,
so I'm just gonna shut up.

50:07.872 --> 50:11.008
- Thank you so much.

50:11.008 --> 50:13.377
- I thought this audition was
way better

50:13.377 --> 50:14.778
than your first time.

50:14.778 --> 50:16.951
I really do.

50:16.951 --> 50:17.114
I really do.

50:17.114 --> 50:20.551
I think there's a market
for an act like you.

50:20.551 --> 50:23.487
Your act was brilliant.
I thought you did amazing.

50:25.856 --> 50:29.193
- There is just so much
good-looking testosterone

50:29.193 --> 50:30.594
on this stage.

50:30.594 --> 50:31.695
- Oh!

50:33.864 --> 50:36.166
- I do love
when all the hair is going,

50:36.166 --> 50:38.802
and all the water's spritzing
everywhere.

50:38.802 --> 50:42.940
I mean, there's just nothing
boring about this act.

50:42.940 --> 50:44.008
I really love it.

50:44.008 --> 50:46.510
- We love you too.

50:46.510 --> 50:46.951
- George?

50:46.951 --> 50:48.846
- George?

50:48.846 --> 50:51.415
- Well...

50:51.415 --> 50:55.152
I just want to say...

50:56.320 --> 50:57.855
- ♪ I can be your hero, baby ♪

50:58.989 --> 51:00.591
- Oh, my God!

51:00.591 --> 51:04.395
- ♪ I can kiss away the pain ♪

51:08.999 --> 51:11.869
- Now there's six spots.
- Yep.

51:11.869 --> 51:13.404
- I got goose bumps.

51:13.404 --> 51:16.951
- ♪ You can take
my breath away ♪

51:16.951 --> 51:17.641
- ♪ You can take
my breath away ♪

51:20.611 --> 51:23.047
- George Lopez...

51:23.047 --> 51:25.616
has hit the Golden Buzzer.

51:25.616 --> 51:29.386
- ♪ I can kiss away the pain ♪

51:29.386 --> 51:32.189
Oh!

51:32.189 --> 51:35.826
- ♪ I will stand by you
forever ♪

51:35.826 --> 51:38.162
- An amazing performance,
indeed.

51:38.162 --> 51:41.065
So the judges do not even have
to deliberate.

51:41.065 --> 51:44.134
You guys get
one of the seven spots

51:44.134 --> 51:46.370
and you're going
straight to the live show.

51:49.373 --> 51:50.941
How's it feel?

51:50.941 --> 51:54.411
I have no words for that, man.

51:54.411 --> 51:56.146
- What do you want to say
to George Lopez?

52:02.686 --> 52:04.955
- Argentina! Viva Argentina!

52:04.955 --> 52:06.824
- George,
you just felt the passion.

52:06.824 --> 52:08.192
Tell us about it.

52:08.192 --> 52:10.361
- You know, they're so in sync.
They have the passion.

52:10.361 --> 52:11.962
They have the love
of their brotherhood.

52:11.962 --> 52:13.430
They have the love
of their country.

52:13.430 --> 52:15.899
And the dance is amazing.
And there was no doubt.

52:15.899 --> 52:16.951
No doubt.

52:16.951 --> 52:16.967
No doubt.

52:25.442 --> 52:28.946
- Congratulations, guys.
We'll see you in the live show.

52:28.946 --> 52:30.714
- ♪ I can be your hero ♪

52:33.117 --> 52:36.220
♪ I can kiss away the pain ♪

52:37.888 --> 52:39.189
♪ And I will stand by you
forever ♪

52:39.189 --> 52:40.524
- They were really emotional,
huh, George?

52:40.524 --> 52:42.626
- Yeah, they were crying.
I made them cry.

52:42.626 --> 52:45.663
- You're the biggest hero
in Argentina right now.

52:45.663 --> 52:46.951
- This means everything to us.

52:46.951 --> 52:48.132
- This means everything to us.

52:50.067 --> 52:52.102
- This is more
than a dream come true.

52:52.102 --> 52:54.738
Really. It's--

52:54.738 --> 52:57.541
It's--I don't have words
for this.

52:57.541 --> 52:58.609
- It's beautiful.

53:17.094 --> 53:19.296
- Whoa.

53:19.296 --> 53:21.065
Is that loaded?
- Not yet.

53:21.065 --> 53:23.500
- Oh, okay. All right.
What is your name, sir?

53:23.500 --> 53:24.802
- My name is Ian Stewart.

53:24.802 --> 53:27.137
- I remember you,
and I love you,

53:27.137 --> 53:28.439
and at the same time,
I hate you,

53:28.439 --> 53:30.240
because there's so much danger.

53:30.240 --> 53:33.043
What can you offer us this time
that we didn't see before?

53:33.043 --> 53:34.511
Could you die tonight?

53:34.511 --> 53:36.280
- There's a good chance
I wouldn't walk off the stage.

53:36.280 --> 53:36.984
- Oh, no.
How much time have you put

53:36.984 --> 53:38.315
- Oh, no.
How much time have you put

53:38.315 --> 53:39.750
into the preparation of this?

53:39.750 --> 53:41.985
- Hours.
- Hours?

53:43.020 --> 53:44.021
Good luck.

53:44.021 --> 53:45.089
- Let's go.

53:45.089 --> 53:46.390
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

53:48.425 --> 53:51.895
Today, we're gonna be combining
crossbow sharpshooting

53:51.895 --> 53:53.864
with circus skills.

53:53.864 --> 53:55.899
- Really?
- For the first shot,

53:55.899 --> 53:57.367
I'm going to attempt
to shoot the balloon

53:57.367 --> 53:59.002
out of my assistant's hand.

53:59.002 --> 54:01.004
To make this more difficult,

54:01.004 --> 54:02.740
I've been drinking all week.

54:14.752 --> 54:18.122
- Wha--it didn't even let
the air out.

54:18.122 --> 54:20.057
- I'm not gonna lie.
That was odd.

54:20.057 --> 54:23.761
However, I'm now gonna
turn the danger back on myself.

54:23.761 --> 54:26.797
I'm going to load six crossbows.

54:26.797 --> 54:28.665
- Oh, come on.

54:32.569 --> 54:34.304
- Shouldn't he be talking to us?

54:34.304 --> 54:36.440
'Cause it's just silence.

54:41.979 --> 54:44.314
- And now I'm going to attempt

54:44.314 --> 54:45.482
to shoot my crossbow...

54:45.482 --> 54:48.118
- Now he talks.
- And cause a chain reaction,

54:48.118 --> 54:50.888
which is going to eventually
shoot that crossbow...

54:52.823 --> 54:56.026
Between my legs.

54:56.026 --> 54:58.896
To make this more dangerous,

54:58.896 --> 55:03.200
I'm going to be using
a moving target.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.535
We thought it would be more fun

55:04.535 --> 55:06.984
if we set the final arrow
on fire.

55:06.984 --> 55:08.238
if we set the final arrow
on fire.

55:11.241 --> 55:12.242
- Whoa.

55:20.017 --> 55:21.251
- That's it?

55:24.254 --> 55:26.623
- Your trick at the end
was fantastic,

55:26.623 --> 55:29.326
but to get there,
you lost me.

55:29.326 --> 55:32.896
- When we watch you, it's like
the world's most dangerous

55:32.896 --> 55:34.965
accountant.

55:36.433 --> 55:36.984
- Thank you.

55:36.984 --> 55:39.269
- Thank you.

55:39.269 --> 55:41.638
- Look at the balloon.
How does that happen?

55:41.638 --> 55:43.373
The air is even bored
by his performance.

55:44.741 --> 55:46.176
- Oof.

55:46.176 --> 55:49.479
- I really hope they're
in the mood for a little danger.

55:50.848 --> 55:52.182
- ♪ Danger, danger ♪

55:52.182 --> 55:53.817
- My name is Ryan Stock.
- I'm AmberLynn.

55:53.817 --> 55:57.888
- We're a couple,
and we perform a danger act.

55:57.888 --> 56:01.992
- I met Ryan when I was 19
at a festival, actually.

56:01.992 --> 56:03.460
- We hit it off right away.

56:03.460 --> 56:05.696
And we've been together
24 hours a day,

56:05.696 --> 56:06.984
7 days a week now
for almost 15 years.

56:06.984 --> 56:10.000
7 days a week now
for almost 15 years.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.636
- At our house,
anything is fair game

56:12.636 --> 56:14.171
to go up the nose
or down the throat.

56:14.171 --> 56:15.873
Ryan, what do you want
for dinner?

56:15.873 --> 56:18.508
Ryan plays with absolutely
everything.

56:18.508 --> 56:21.211
He essentially always is trying
to make me smile

56:21.211 --> 56:23.513
and entertain me.

56:23.513 --> 56:26.583
- ♪ Danger, danger ♪

56:26.583 --> 56:27.985
- Our act is kind of binary.

56:27.985 --> 56:29.353
Either you like
that kind of thing,

56:29.353 --> 56:31.054
or you don't like
that kind of thing.

56:31.054 --> 56:32.656
- I think this could be
the biggest opportunity

56:32.656 --> 56:33.757
in our lives.

56:33.757 --> 56:35.792
We need to nail
this performance.

56:35.792 --> 56:36.984
- The stakes are high tonight.

56:36.984 --> 56:37.127
- The stakes are high tonight.

56:37.127 --> 56:38.962
If I make a single mistake,

56:38.962 --> 56:40.697
I'll be cut from ear to ear.

56:40.697 --> 56:42.532
It's extremely dangerous.

56:42.532 --> 56:44.201
- Something can always
go wrong.

56:44.201 --> 56:47.871
And the last thing I want to do
is lose the love of my life.

56:53.510 --> 56:57.080
Remember him?

56:57.080 --> 56:58.081
- I remember.
- Ohh.

56:58.081 --> 57:01.418
How you doing?

57:03.120 --> 57:05.122
- We're already using
our imagination

57:05.122 --> 57:06.984
of what part of your body
you'll hang yourself from.

57:06.984 --> 57:08.058
of what part of your body
you'll hang yourself from.

57:08.058 --> 57:10.460
- You stepping it up?
- We're stepping it up.

57:10.460 --> 57:11.695
- Ugh.

57:11.695 --> 57:13.730
- Good luck.

57:13.730 --> 57:16.967
- Now, I used to start every
show by lighting a cigarette,

57:16.967 --> 57:18.936
but these days,
you can't smoke anywhere,

57:18.936 --> 57:22.239
so instead of a cigarette,
I've got one of these.

57:22.239 --> 57:25.042
Now, this is a blowtorch.

57:25.042 --> 57:27.144
It burns at over 1,500 degrees.

57:27.144 --> 57:28.578
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Now, for those of you

57:28.578 --> 57:31.581
who have ever seen somebody put
a cigarette out on their tongue,

57:31.581 --> 57:33.016
we're pretty sure you haven't
seen that person

57:33.016 --> 57:34.217
put out a blowtorch,

57:34.217 --> 57:36.253
and there's a really good reason
for that.

57:36.253 --> 57:36.984
I call this trick "putting
a blowtorch out on my tongue."

57:36.984 --> 57:40.257
I call this trick "putting
a blowtorch out on my tongue."

dangerous things I do.

58:01.511 --> 58:05.582
Ladies and gentlemen, we call it

you for finding a partner

59:36.984 --> 59:39.776

59:39.776 --> 59:41.578

- Puts up with this.

59:41.578 --> 59:44.448
- That puts up with you grabbing
a chainsaw by your teeth.

59:44.448 --> 59:47.851
This is almost--
there's an art to this.

59:47.851 --> 59:49.719
I could go to Vegas and see this

59:49.719 --> 59:51.788
with music
and the whole production,

59:51.788 --> 59:53.190
and be entertained by it.

59:53.190 --> 59:54.758
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

59:57.094 --> 1:00:00.330
- I mean, it's really tough.
It really is.

1:00:00.330 --> 1:00:03.066
I have such a hard time
watching this. I really do.

1:00:03.066 --> 1:00:04.568
You know, I just don't want you
to hurt yourself.

1:00:04.568 --> 1:00:06.984
I can't join the fan club.

1:00:06.984 --> 1:00:08.705
I can't join the fan club.

1:00:08.705 --> 1:00:10.340

1:00:10.340 --> 1:00:11.374
there are people that love it.

1:00:11.374 --> 1:00:12.609
There's no middle ground
with you.

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:13.743
- No.
- I love that.

1:00:13.743 --> 1:00:15.879
So people are either hate it
or they love it.

1:00:15.879 --> 1:00:18.115
And I think
there's a place for you.

1:00:18.115 --> 1:00:20.217
I think you can
make a name for yourself.

1:00:20.217 --> 1:00:23.220
- I'm with the others. You're
like a human horror movie.

1:00:23.220 --> 1:00:27.524
And when I watch a horror movie,
I do do this half the time,

1:00:27.524 --> 1:00:30.026
but I'm sort of compelled
because it's so disgusting.

1:00:30.026 --> 1:00:32.429
This is gonna be a tricky one.
We're gonna have

1:00:32.429 --> 1:00:34.364
a long conversation about you
later, I think.

1:00:34.364 --> 1:00:35.732
- All right.
- All right. Thanks a lot.

1:00:35.732 --> 1:00:36.984
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Have a good night.

1:00:36.984 --> 1:00:38.168
- Thank you.

1:00:38.168 --> 1:00:41.004
- ♪ High voltage

1:00:41.004 --> 1:00:43.473

down your throat?

1:00:43.473 --> 1:00:45.575
- I think it's unbelievable.
I think I'd go and see

1:00:45.575 --> 1:00:47.210
a show like that.
- I wouldn't.

1:00:47.210 --> 1:00:49.246
- Definitely,
you'd sell tickets.

1:00:49.246 --> 1:00:51.615
- I'm just happy
that you still have a face.

1:00:51.615 --> 1:00:53.316
- Me too.

1:00:53.316 --> 1:00:55.852
- And that's a win in my book.

1:00:55.852 --> 1:00:58.889
- ♪ When we touch

1:01:03.727 --> 1:01:05.228
- I'm glad you're here.
- Thank you.

1:01:05.228 --> 1:01:06.997
- I feel like comedians
need support.

1:01:06.997 --> 1:01:09.366
- George Lopez--is he gonna
raise the bar a little bit

1:01:09.366 --> 1:01:12.369
and expect a little bit more
from the comedians?

1:01:12.369 --> 1:01:13.904
- Well, you know,
the thing with comedians is

1:01:13.904 --> 1:01:15.972
you could do great
in front of four people,

1:01:15.972 --> 1:01:17.807
and then bomb
in front of 4,000.

1:01:17.807 --> 1:01:20.277
- Like, what am I supposed to do
if it's not funny

1:01:20.277 --> 1:01:21.745
and it's not making me laugh?

1:01:21.745 --> 1:01:24.181
- You're supposed to do
the fake one, like "Ha-ha!"

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:25.248
- Did anyone ever tell you

1:01:25.248 --> 1:01:27.584
you look exactly
like George Lopez?

1:01:27.584 --> 1:01:28.818
- Ha. Oh, thank you.

1:01:28.818 --> 1:01:31.057
I'm talking to Heidi Klum. I--

1:01:31.057 --> 1:01:32.722
I'm talking to Heidi Klum. I--

1:01:32.722 --> 1:01:34.824
I love Keanu Reaves,

1:01:34.824 --> 1:01:39.396
who I truly believe is
the best actor on the planet...

1:01:39.396 --> 1:01:41.131
Jupiter.

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:46.469
- The material isn't strong.
I don't know.

1:01:46.469 --> 1:01:49.806
- You had a really good shot,
but that was flat.

1:01:49.806 --> 1:01:52.909
- Wow. That's pretty rough.

1:01:52.909 --> 1:01:55.045
- The rule in comedy is
you got to make fun of yourself

1:01:55.045 --> 1:01:56.613
before you can make fun
of anybody else.

1:01:56.613 --> 1:01:58.615
That's number one.

1:01:58.615 --> 1:01:59.916

1:02:03.286 --> 1:02:05.989
- Hi, Ryan.
Nice to see you again.

1:02:05.989 --> 1:02:08.491
- It's nice to see you too.
- You had a very good audition.

1:02:08.491 --> 1:02:10.360
It was a lot of fun,
because I remember you--

1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:12.862
you were that kid
that has never left the house,

1:02:12.862 --> 1:02:14.397
and then you were singing
about it or something, right?

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:17.734
- Yeah, yeah, this is my second
time away from home, so...

1:02:19.035 --> 1:02:20.537
- I remember you well.

1:02:20.537 --> 1:02:23.573
How's it been with the ladies
since the last time we saw you?

1:02:23.573 --> 1:02:24.574
- Oh-ho-ho!

1:02:24.574 --> 1:02:26.276
It has not changed at all.

1:02:26.276 --> 1:02:28.478
- Aw, really?

1:02:28.478 --> 1:02:30.480
- I'm Ryan Beard,
I'm 18 years old,

1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:31.057
and I'm a homeschooled student
from Kansas City, Kansas.

1:02:37.621 --> 1:02:39.155
- Madison.
- Nice to meet you, Madison.

1:02:39.155 --> 1:02:40.156
- Good to meet you too.

1:02:40.156 --> 1:02:41.758
- For whatever reason,

1:02:41.758 --> 1:02:43.393
spending a bunch of time
by yourself

1:02:43.393 --> 1:02:45.862
does not equal
good social skills.

1:02:45.862 --> 1:02:48.064
- So do you have
a girlfriend now, or no?

1:02:48.064 --> 1:02:49.899
- No.
- I don't have a boyfriend, so--

1:02:49.899 --> 1:02:51.901

- You're really smart,
and I love that.

1:03:07.617 --> 1:03:09.219
This is an audition
I'm gonna remember.

1:03:09.219 --> 1:03:10.253

1:03:10.253 --> 1:03:11.454

1:03:11.454 --> 1:03:13.757
Even though I'm making jokes
up onstage,

1:03:13.757 --> 1:03:15.492
this is not a joke to me.

1:03:15.492 --> 1:03:17.527
My dream is to get
to the live shows.

1:03:17.527 --> 1:03:19.162
So all I've got to do is
keep up this momentum

1:03:19.162 --> 1:03:20.397
that I've set for myself,

1:03:20.397 --> 1:03:22.565
and I think I'm set to go.

1:03:22.565 --> 1:03:24.301

Good luck.

You know,
you're wearing a sweater

1:04:22.959 --> 1:04:24.260
and you have some swagger.

1:04:24.260 --> 1:04:26.262
And that's hard to get swagger
in a sweater.

1:04:27.731 --> 1:04:30.700
But the material isn't as strong
as your stage presence

1:04:30.700 --> 1:04:31.057
and your personality.

1:04:31.057 --> 1:04:31.935

it wasn't a good song.

1:04:41.644 --> 1:04:43.646
It was very uncomfortable.

1:04:43.646 --> 1:04:45.915
I'm sorry. I didn't get it.

1:04:45.915 --> 1:04:49.119
- Ouch. Brutal.

1:04:49.119 --> 1:04:50.553
- We're not gonna remember this.

1:04:50.553 --> 1:04:51.988
We're gonna remember
your first audition.

1:04:51.988 --> 1:04:54.758
- Yeah, that's a good--
- This just didn't happen.

1:04:54.758 --> 1:04:56.159
- That's fair.

1:04:56.159 --> 1:04:58.261
- You have to bomb
in order to get better.

1:04:58.261 --> 1:05:00.196
- Yeah, and that's basically
what just happened.

1:05:00.196 --> 1:05:01.057
I wish I just didn't have
to bomb

1:05:01.057 --> 1:05:01.464
I wish I just didn't have
to bomb

1:05:01.464 --> 1:05:02.966
in front of 20 million people.

1:05:02.966 --> 1:05:05.068
- Well, we all like him,
but that was awful.

1:05:05.068 --> 1:05:06.169
- I feel really bad for him.

1:05:06.169 --> 1:05:07.971
I hope we have someone fun
coming next.

1:05:07.971 --> 1:05:10.340
- They're bringing
their boxing gloves tonight.

1:05:10.340 --> 1:05:13.209
My name is Sam Morril.
I'm 29 years old.

1:05:13.209 --> 1:05:15.345
I'm a standup comic
from New York City.

1:05:15.345 --> 1:05:16.913
Hello.

1:05:16.913 --> 1:05:18.481
I come from a family of lawyers.

1:05:18.481 --> 1:05:20.316
My brother's a lawyer.
My sister's a lawyer.

1:05:20.316 --> 1:05:22.252
My dad's a lawyer.

1:05:22.252 --> 1:05:23.520
I'm not a lawyer.

1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:27.457
That would be a weird contestant
on "AGT," probably.

1:05:27.457 --> 1:05:29.793
My brother and sister would get
attention by being smart,

1:05:29.793 --> 1:05:31.057
so I got attention
by being funny.

1:05:31.057 --> 1:05:31.294
so I got attention
by being funny.

1:05:31.294 --> 1:05:33.596
In the elevator the other day,
I farted. I laughed.

1:05:33.596 --> 1:05:35.432
Then the door opened.

1:05:35.432 --> 1:05:36.733
A pretty girl came on.
I was like,

1:05:36.733 --> 1:05:38.902
"That's not funny anymore."

1:05:38.902 --> 1:05:40.603
Then it was my stop.
I got off.

1:05:40.603 --> 1:05:42.071
Doors shut.
She's stuck with the fart.

1:05:42.071 --> 1:05:43.440
Funny again.

1:05:46.376 --> 1:05:48.244
Since my first audition,
I've been busy.

1:05:48.244 --> 1:05:50.346
I've been on the road.
I got to open for Amy Schumer

1:05:50.346 --> 1:05:51.414
for a week.

1:05:51.414 --> 1:05:52.515
Hey. What's up, guys?

1:05:52.515 --> 1:05:54.484
- We always knew you had it.

1:05:54.484 --> 1:05:57.387
- That's right.
- And by "it," I mean

1:05:57.387 --> 1:06:00.156
the human papillomavirus.

1:06:00.156 --> 1:06:01.057
- It's incredibly validating
to have people laugh

1:06:01.057 --> 1:06:03.126
- It's incredibly validating
to have people laugh

1:06:03.126 --> 1:06:04.828
at something you thought of.

1:06:07.363 --> 1:06:08.832
I just hope I don't get buzzed.

1:06:11.701 --> 1:06:14.003
- Hello.
- Hi.

1:06:14.003 --> 1:06:16.673
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

1:06:16.673 --> 1:06:18.808
I'm very excited to see you,
actually,

1:06:18.808 --> 1:06:20.310
'cause you had me laughing a lot
last time.

1:06:20.310 --> 1:06:23.346
- Thank you.
- Okay, well, go for it.

1:06:23.346 --> 1:06:25.682
- Thank you.

1:06:25.682 --> 1:06:29.018
So, uh, my girlfriend
wants to have kids.

1:06:29.018 --> 1:06:31.057
I love kids. We tell kids
they can be whatever they want.

1:06:31.057 --> 1:06:32.021
I love kids. We tell kids
they can be whatever they want.

1:06:32.021 --> 1:06:33.690
If I have a kid,
I'm gonna be honest.

1:06:33.690 --> 1:06:35.425
If he's like,
"Daddy, can I play in the NBA?"

1:06:35.425 --> 1:06:39.128
I'm gonna be like, "Look,
statistically, it's possible,

1:06:39.128 --> 1:06:41.731
"but let's take a look
at this chart.

1:06:41.731 --> 1:06:44.334
"I've taken the liberty of
factoring in your size and race,

1:06:44.334 --> 1:06:46.836
"and it doesn't look good.

1:06:46.836 --> 1:06:47.971
"You're a tiny Jew.

1:06:49.172 --> 1:06:52.842
- "That's why we named you TJ,
actually,

1:06:52.842 --> 1:06:54.711
as a reminder."

1:06:56.246 --> 1:06:59.015
I used to meet women on the road
after shows.

1:06:59.015 --> 1:07:00.850
I remember once after a show,
a woman said, "I'd invite you

1:07:00.850 --> 1:07:01.057
back to my apartment,
but it's a bit messy."

1:07:01.057 --> 1:07:03.052
back to my apartment,
but it's a bit messy."

1:07:03.052 --> 1:07:04.454
And I was like, "Of course
your place is a mess.

1:07:04.454 --> 1:07:05.655
"If you're willing
to sleep with me,

1:07:05.655 --> 1:07:07.457
I'm gonna assume
your whole life is in shambles."

1:07:11.961 --> 1:07:13.863
A messy apartment is not
a deal-breaker.

1:07:13.863 --> 1:07:15.665
I dated a hoarder
for six months,

1:07:15.665 --> 1:07:17.000
and she broke up with me,

1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.369
which stings extra hard.

1:07:19.369 --> 1:07:21.905
I'm like the one thing
she can get rid of, you know?

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:27.310
Sometimes, I get ashamed
of what I find attractive.

1:07:27.310 --> 1:07:29.012
I'll meet, like,
a really beautiful woman,

1:07:29.012 --> 1:07:30.480
but she's got
a terrible personality,

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:31.057
and still I feel it in my pants,
and I'm like, "Damn it."

1:07:31.057 --> 1:07:33.316
and still I feel it in my pants,
and I'm like, "Damn it."

1:07:33.316 --> 1:07:34.951
Personality should matter.

1:07:34.951 --> 1:07:37.654
But it doesn't.
Not to this guy.

1:07:37.654 --> 1:07:40.223
Having a penis is kind of like
having a Republican son.

1:07:40.223 --> 1:07:41.491
You know?

1:07:41.491 --> 1:07:43.259
It's a part of me,
so I have to support it,

1:07:43.259 --> 1:07:45.361
but these are not the views
that I endorse, you know?

1:07:45.361 --> 1:07:46.696
Thank you so much.

1:07:54.337 --> 1:07:56.472
- Howie, you were all happy,
laughing away.

1:07:56.472 --> 1:07:58.708
- Very funny.
You're very likeable.

1:07:58.708 --> 1:08:01.057
Your material is strong.
- Thank you.

1:08:01.057 --> 1:08:01.344
Your material is strong.
- Thank you.

1:08:01.344 --> 1:08:02.946
- Well,
I liked you the first time,

1:08:02.946 --> 1:08:04.447
and I love you again
the second time.

1:08:04.447 --> 1:08:05.982
I think you're great.
You've just--

1:08:05.982 --> 1:08:07.917
you're just funny
and likeable.

1:08:07.917 --> 1:08:10.520
- Thank you.
- And actually quite cute.

1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:14.591
- I'll take it.
- That's good.

1:08:14.591 --> 1:08:16.125
Heidi?

1:08:16.125 --> 1:08:18.861
- It worked for me.
You made me laugh.

1:08:18.861 --> 1:08:20.396
- Thank you.

1:08:20.396 --> 1:08:22.999
- You definitely have
your own thought process.

1:08:22.999 --> 1:08:25.568
Very funny. The last joke was
an amazingly funny joke.

1:08:25.568 --> 1:08:29.105
And to gradually build
and deliver like that, Sam,

1:08:29.105 --> 1:08:30.340
you're very funny.
- Thank you.

1:08:30.340 --> 1:08:31.057
- Congratulations.

1:08:31.057 --> 1:08:32.241
- Congratulations.

1:08:32.241 --> 1:08:33.476
- Well done. Good job tonight.

1:08:33.476 --> 1:08:34.877
- Congratulations, Sam.

1:08:34.877 --> 1:08:36.145
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1:08:39.415 --> 1:08:41.150
- That's a great act.
- Yeah.

1:08:44.487 --> 1:08:45.855
- This is the worst part.

1:08:45.855 --> 1:08:50.059
Somebody argued for each
of these acts passionately.

1:08:50.059 --> 1:08:52.328
- You have no idea
how upset I am.

1:09:03.239 --> 1:09:04.307
- It would mean the world

1:09:04.307 --> 1:09:06.142
to get through
to the next round.

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:08.911
They can't take
every single act.

1:09:08.911 --> 1:09:12.482
- There's a lot of singers
in this competition.

1:09:12.482 --> 1:09:16.386
That's really,
really frightening.

1:09:16.386 --> 1:09:19.689
- There's only six spots left,

1:09:19.689 --> 1:09:24.293
and we're kind of battling
each other out right now.

1:09:24.293 --> 1:09:25.995
- It was generally a good night.

1:09:25.995 --> 1:09:27.697
- Yeah.
It was a great night of talent.

1:09:27.697 --> 1:09:28.067
- All right, guys.
Final act coming up right now.

1:09:28.067 --> 1:09:30.566
- All right, guys.
Final act coming up right now.

1:09:30.566 --> 1:09:31.534
You guys ready?

1:09:36.139 --> 1:09:38.574
- What's going on?

1:09:38.574 --> 1:09:41.711
- Hi. We meet again.

1:09:41.711 --> 1:09:43.713
- It's good to be back.

1:09:43.713 --> 1:09:45.481
- Just remind me.
Where are you from again?

1:09:45.481 --> 1:09:47.984
- I live in Los Angeles.
- And how old are you?

1:09:47.984 --> 1:09:50.553
- I'm 28.
- Who are you here with tonight?

1:09:50.553 --> 1:09:52.288
- I have my mom here.

1:09:55.124 --> 1:09:56.459
- When you dream
of being a singer,

1:09:56.459 --> 1:09:58.067
where do you see yourself?

1:09:58.067 --> 1:09:58.094
where do you see yourself?

1:09:58.094 --> 1:10:00.997
- Well, I want people
to feel things when I sing,

1:10:00.997 --> 1:10:03.466
and that's the goal.

1:10:03.466 --> 1:10:04.934
I'm Brian Justin Crum.

1:10:04.934 --> 1:10:08.671
I'm 28, I'm a singer,
and I drive for a car service.

1:10:08.671 --> 1:10:11.174
Growing up,
I was just so happy.

1:10:11.174 --> 1:10:13.910
I loved to sing. I would dance
down the hallways.

1:10:13.910 --> 1:10:17.780
But, you know, I had
a lot of hard times at school.

1:10:17.780 --> 1:10:20.883
- ♪ But that won't scare me
away, oh, no ♪

1:10:20.883 --> 1:10:23.686
- I was overweight.
And I definitely knew

1:10:23.686 --> 1:10:25.955
from the time I was
six or seven

1:10:25.955 --> 1:10:27.990
that I was gay.

1:10:27.990 --> 1:10:28.067
That brought a lot of bullying
my way.

1:10:28.067 --> 1:10:31.360
That brought a lot of bullying
my way.

1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:34.330
- In elementary school, they
would whisper behind his back

1:10:34.330 --> 1:10:36.599
that he was gay.

1:10:36.599 --> 1:10:39.569
More middle school, high school,
it was--

1:10:39.569 --> 1:10:42.605
he'd walk by, and someone would
just call him a faggot.

1:10:42.605 --> 1:10:46.542
That was really hard for him
for that to happen.

1:10:46.542 --> 1:10:50.747
I used to fall on my knees
and pray for him.

1:10:50.747 --> 1:10:52.115

1:15:11.841 --> 1:15:13.509
- When you go
on a show like this

1:15:13.509 --> 1:15:14.910
and you've got two or three
minutes,

1:15:14.910 --> 1:15:17.513
you've got to find
your own lane,

1:15:17.513 --> 1:15:20.049
because if you can turn a song
into a performance,

1:15:20.049 --> 1:15:21.283
people remember you.

1:15:21.283 --> 1:15:23.185
And I think you just
demonstrated that.

1:15:23.185 --> 1:15:25.521
Every time we've seen you,
you've put on a performance,

1:15:25.521 --> 1:15:27.223
which, for me, is exciting.

1:15:27.223 --> 1:15:28.067
It was actually
quite breathtaking.

1:15:28.067 --> 1:15:29.425
It was actually
quite breathtaking.

1:15:34.130 --> 1:15:37.533
- You took your time
and told us a story,

1:15:37.533 --> 1:15:40.002
and then you exploded
in the middle.

1:15:40.002 --> 1:15:42.772
And to go from that big
to then that small

1:15:42.772 --> 1:15:44.040
at the end of the song

1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:46.909
is genius, in my eyes.

1:15:46.909 --> 1:15:51.213
Love you, love you, love you.
You're great.

1:15:51.213 --> 1:15:52.548
- You do give me the chills

1:15:52.548 --> 1:15:54.683
because you sing
with so much passion.

1:15:54.683 --> 1:15:57.053
And I do--I feel it with you.

1:15:57.053 --> 1:15:58.067
I think you're
one of the best singers

1:15:58.067 --> 1:15:58.421
I think you're
one of the best singers

1:15:58.421 --> 1:15:59.822
we have on the show this season.

1:16:06.028 --> 1:16:09.398
- You know, you said
that you want people to feel,

1:16:09.398 --> 1:16:11.567
but to choose a song
and to sing it

1:16:11.567 --> 1:16:13.002
and to make people feel--

1:16:13.002 --> 1:16:15.271
and I think we all feel
like we're a creep

1:16:15.271 --> 1:16:16.705
and we're weirdoes
and we're different.

1:16:16.705 --> 1:16:19.442
And I, you know, suffer from
mental health issues,

1:16:19.442 --> 1:16:21.444
and we always feel alone,
and then we find out we're not,

1:16:21.444 --> 1:16:23.546
and we all belong here,
and it makes the world.

1:16:23.546 --> 1:16:26.882
And that was a wonderfully
moving rendition.

1:16:26.882 --> 1:16:28.067
Perfect, that song.

1:16:28.067 --> 1:16:28.717
Perfect, that song.

1:16:30.953 --> 1:16:32.521
- Well done.

1:16:32.521 --> 1:16:33.756
- Thank you.

1:16:44.733 --> 1:16:47.303
- That was amazing.
- I love him.

1:16:54.076 --> 1:16:56.979
- I don't know if anybody else
was as moved as me by that.

1:16:56.979 --> 1:16:58.067
I love that song.
- Oh, I love that song.

1:16:58.067 --> 1:16:58.280
I love that song.
- Oh, I love that song.

1:16:58.280 --> 1:16:59.815
- Feel like a weirdo.
- Yeah.

1:16:59.815 --> 1:17:02.351
- I mean, I felt
like he was singing to me.

1:17:02.351 --> 1:17:04.887
- Mwah.

1:17:04.887 --> 1:17:08.457
- It's tough. The stakes--
the stakes are high, you know?

1:17:08.457 --> 1:17:10.025
- I have more than six
worthy of--

1:17:10.025 --> 1:17:11.460
- I have more than six.
- I have more than six,

1:17:11.460 --> 1:17:12.661
looking at my list.

1:17:12.661 --> 1:17:13.796
- It's gonna be tough.

1:17:21.237 --> 1:17:22.404
- Welcome back to

1:17:22.404 --> 1:17:24.073
Judge Cuts."

1:17:24.073 --> 1:17:26.242
All 20 acts have performed.

1:17:26.242 --> 1:17:28.344
Now the judges have to go off
and deliberate

1:17:28.344 --> 1:17:30.479
to see which six acts are gonna
make it through

1:17:30.479 --> 1:17:32.181
to the live shows.

1:17:32.181 --> 1:17:35.351
- 20 acts.
George, you've put one through,

1:17:35.351 --> 1:17:36.752
so we've got to pick six

1:17:36.752 --> 1:17:37.853
out of the remainders.

1:17:37.853 --> 1:17:39.655
This is gonna be difficult.
- O-M-G.

1:17:39.655 --> 1:17:42.224
- Two minutes of performance
could change your life.

1:17:42.224 --> 1:17:45.294
People want to know if they're
gonna be moving forward

1:17:45.294 --> 1:17:47.229
or left behind.

1:17:47.229 --> 1:17:49.034
- Our fate is actually
in the judges' hands.

1:17:49.034 --> 1:17:49.532
- Our fate is actually
in the judges' hands.

1:17:49.532 --> 1:17:51.767
It's their choice.

1:17:51.767 --> 1:17:55.204
- I think him, her, and him
better than her.

1:17:55.204 --> 1:17:57.706
- No! I disagree.

1:17:57.706 --> 1:18:00.709
- Look at this. We have five.
Two more.

1:18:00.709 --> 1:18:02.411
- I've waited my whole life
for a moment like this,

1:18:02.411 --> 1:18:04.813
and I want that "yes"
really bad.

1:18:04.813 --> 1:18:08.050
- This could be the winner
of "America's Got Talent."

1:18:08.050 --> 1:18:09.318
- You are crazy.
- I'm not.

1:18:09.318 --> 1:18:11.987
- No. There is no way.

1:18:11.987 --> 1:18:14.957
- I've danced my whole life,

1:18:14.957 --> 1:18:17.893
and finally I have
a chance to do

1:18:17.893 --> 1:18:19.034
what I've always wanted to do.

1:18:19.034 --> 1:18:19.662
what I've always wanted to do.

1:18:19.662 --> 1:18:22.298
- Okay, everyone. The judges
have made their decisions.

1:18:22.298 --> 1:18:24.033
- I had a great time with you,
really.

1:18:24.033 --> 1:18:26.435
It felt so natural.
Thank you, Simon.

1:18:27.803 --> 1:18:29.205
- Now we have
to break the news...

1:18:29.205 --> 1:18:31.373
who's going to the live shows
and who's out.

1:18:37.980 --> 1:18:39.215
- They're all holding hands.

1:18:39.215 --> 1:18:41.016
- Aw, look at the dog.
- Look at the dog,

1:18:41.016 --> 1:18:42.585
holding hands.

1:18:42.585 --> 1:18:44.887
- This is the worst part,
genuinely.

1:18:44.887 --> 1:18:49.034
The truth is somebody argued for
each of these acts passionately.

1:18:49.034 --> 1:18:50.693
The truth is somebody argued for
each of these acts passionately.

1:18:50.693 --> 1:18:53.896
It comes down to one act is
gonna go through

1:18:53.896 --> 1:18:55.998

1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:00.235
to the bitter end.
- Yeah, I know.

1:24:00.235 --> 1:24:02.337
- And I want you to know that,
because I love what you do.

1:24:02.337 --> 1:24:06.275
I'm really upset
that you're not part of it.

1:24:06.275 --> 1:24:08.510
- So, I--this has been
a hard week, you know?

1:24:08.510 --> 1:24:12.047
And this has been something
I've really wanted.

1:24:13.048 --> 1:24:14.650
- 7 out of 20 is
just not enough.

1:24:14.650 --> 1:24:16.251
- It's not enough.
- It's not enough.

1:24:16.251 --> 1:24:18.654
- There was too many good people
we're having to send home today.

1:24:19.988 --> 1:24:22.257
- They had to say yes.
I mean, you're, like,

1:24:22.257 --> 1:24:24.026
the most talented man
in the world.

1:24:24.026 --> 1:24:25.694
- Thank you.
- So I'm so proud of you.

1:24:25.694 --> 1:24:27.429
- Thank you, Mom.

1:24:27.429 --> 1:24:30.566
- So seven more acts are
through to the live shows,

1:24:30.566 --> 1:24:32.701
where they'll perform
on the Dolby Theatre Stage

1:24:32.701 --> 1:24:35.604
in Hollywood,
the home of the Oscars.

1:24:35.604 --> 1:24:38.840
Next week, our final 20 acts
battle it out

1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:41.143
for those seven life-changing
spots,

1:24:41.143 --> 1:24:44.846
and we welcome
another special guest judge.
