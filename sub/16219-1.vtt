WEBVTT

02:21.514 --> 02:23.016
Last day.

02:23.049 --> 02:24.551
So it is.

03:18.938 --> 03:21.316
Sorry, boys,
there's been a delay.

03:21.340 --> 03:23.320
Where the fuck's Bradley?

03:23.342 --> 03:25.447
He's taking care of shit
at the airport.

03:25.478 --> 03:27.958
We've got a flight
to Mexico City to catch.

03:27.980 --> 03:29.823
Negative.
We've got a delay.

03:29.849 --> 03:32.227
Why don't you guys
hole up in town for a little bit?

03:32.251 --> 03:33.821
There's a nice little bar there.

03:33.853 --> 03:35.389
We'll meet you at 1800 hours.

03:35.421 --> 03:37.492
Got it. I'll tell Bradley
to meet us there.

03:37.523 --> 03:39.127
Until then.

04:08.821 --> 04:11.324
Mm, Fields.

04:12.759 --> 04:14.898
Here you go.

04:14.927 --> 04:16.873
Nice.

04:16.896 --> 04:18.738
Hell, something
smells good there.

04:18.765 --> 04:20.676
Mm-hmm.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.179
The woman sure can cook.

04:22.201 --> 04:23.737
You got yourself
a lady in the kitchen?

04:23.770 --> 04:25.977
Maybe.

04:26.005 --> 04:28.246
Well, the way you're eating
that burrito,

04:28.274 --> 04:29.810
you should marry her.

04:29.842 --> 04:31.515
Why not?

04:31.544 --> 04:33.023
Nobody cooks that good, man.

04:33.045 --> 04:35.889
Yeah, but you'd have someone to go
home to every night. Think about it.

04:35.915 --> 04:37.417
I'd just get bored.

04:37.450 --> 04:40.158
Yeah, well, being bored,
that's the secret,

04:40.186 --> 04:43.429
I think... bored,
but being happy, like me.

04:43.456 --> 04:44.764
You're happy?

04:44.791 --> 04:47.032
Yeah. Don't I look happy?

04:47.059 --> 04:48.766
An exciting life

04:48.795 --> 04:50.570
is a good way
to get yourself killed.

04:50.596 --> 04:52.576
Remember that.

04:54.133 --> 04:57.740
You heard?
All right. Hey, you want one?

04:57.770 --> 04:59.340
No way.

06:17.783 --> 06:19.956
How are you doing?

06:41.474 --> 06:43.215
Open it up.

06:52.985 --> 06:55.158
HSO team just rolled in.

06:55.187 --> 06:57.133
I said we'd meet them in 10,
at 1300.

06:57.156 --> 06:59.300
Yeah, but oddly enough,
transport still hasn't shown up.

06:59.325 --> 07:01.134
We're waiting
on the marshals again.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.106
We're waiting on
the fucking bus?

07:03.129 --> 07:04.130
Guess so.

07:04.163 --> 07:05.972
God damn it.

07:05.998 --> 07:08.239
I still can't believe I let you
convince me to come here

07:08.267 --> 07:10.304
to shut down
a couple of bullshit buildings.

07:10.336 --> 07:12.509
I usually make
the mess, brother.

07:12.538 --> 07:14.381
You got me cleaning this one up.

07:14.407 --> 07:16.150
See, the thing of it is,
you're getting old, man.

07:16.175 --> 07:17.449
I got to let you down easy.

07:17.476 --> 07:20.855
But the thing of it is, when I want
somebody to cover my back,

07:20.880 --> 07:22.382
you're my man.

07:22.415 --> 07:24.224
All our guys.
they're the best.

07:24.250 --> 07:27.629
The way I look at it, you'll be
down in Mexico in the next few days

07:27.653 --> 07:30.224
and there's 4,000 ways
to get killed down there,

07:30.256 --> 07:31.997
so watch your ass.

07:32.024 --> 07:33.970
Thanks for trying
to cheer me up.

07:36.128 --> 07:37.903
Last time was a real
clusterfuck, wasn't it?

07:37.930 --> 07:40.376
Lost some damn good men.
Yeah.

07:40.399 --> 07:43.073
Army brass should have never
pulled us out of that shithole.

07:43.102 --> 07:44.877
Man, why do you act
so surprised?

07:44.904 --> 07:47.612
That's the way all these highfalutin
military pricks is, man.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.313
You know that.

07:49.342 --> 07:51.720
We're the first guys
that they piss on.

07:51.744 --> 07:55.419
Anyway, next week
you'll get some payback, man.

07:55.448 --> 07:56.950
And speaking of pricks...

07:56.983 --> 08:00.430
Every time I get another stack
of bullshit paperwork,

08:00.453 --> 08:02.455
your fingerprints
are all over it, Cross.

08:02.488 --> 08:05.196
Yeah, I thought your job
was bullshit paperwork.

08:05.224 --> 08:06.828
Shut up.
Negative, Warden.

08:06.859 --> 08:08.361
I ain't got to shut up.

08:08.394 --> 08:10.271
Go hide behind your desk.
We're done here.

08:10.296 --> 08:12.298
No, you're not.
We kind of are, man,

08:12.331 --> 08:15.141
'cause this bitch
is fully decommissioned.

08:15.167 --> 08:17.147
I took us off the grid, man...

08:17.169 --> 08:20.309
computers, satellites, phones.
everything.

08:20.339 --> 08:23.320
Transport will be here soon
to get the detainees.

08:23.342 --> 08:24.377
We're done.

08:24.410 --> 08:26.754
No, you booked in two more
high-security assets last night.

08:26.779 --> 08:28.417
You reopened block D

08:28.447 --> 08:30.757
right after you and Manning
permanently shut it down.

08:30.783 --> 08:33.354
See, you have to
understand something.

08:33.385 --> 08:35.832
this is a black site,

08:35.855 --> 08:38.529
specifically designed
for people of interest.

08:38.557 --> 08:41.128
No, no, no, it was a black site,
Cross... was.

08:42.660 --> 08:44.834
You security contractors.
you're all the same.

08:44.864 --> 08:48.243
You think you're hot shit ex-soldiers,
big fucking heroes.

08:48.267 --> 08:50.110
Well, you're a pain in my ass.

08:50.136 --> 08:52.446
We already had four people
of special interest here.

08:52.471 --> 08:54.644
We don't have enough MP-s
to legally hold

08:54.673 --> 08:56.414
all the fucking interesting
people we got,

08:56.442 --> 08:58.615
let alone the two
who came in last night.

08:58.644 --> 09:01.288
When you signed those two in last
night, you took authority over them.

09:01.313 --> 09:04.123
That means signing them out
will be your job, not mine.

09:04.150 --> 09:06.152
I would enjoy the process.

09:06.185 --> 09:09.394
Well, the transfer unit's late,
so you're going nowhere

09:09.422 --> 09:12.528
till all the detainees have cleared
the gate on the way out.

10:16.755 --> 10:19.167
Step away from the bars.

10:20.192 --> 10:21.364
Detainees, step back.

10:21.393 --> 10:23.395
Let me out!

10:26.398 --> 10:29.038
Detainees, step back.

10:31.704 --> 10:34.082
What the fuck?

10:34.106 --> 10:36.086
Fucking liars!

10:36.108 --> 10:38.520
I'm gonna fucking kill you guys!

10:38.544 --> 10:40.353
I'll fucking kill you all!

10:46.418 --> 10:48.455
Chow. Bring him in.

10:48.487 --> 10:50.660
Fuck you.
I'm not eating that shit.

10:50.689 --> 10:52.464
Don't ever touch me.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.340
Code red.
Backup in the courtyard.

10:56.362 --> 10:59.434
Repeat, backup in the courtyard!
Code red.

10:59.465 --> 11:01.467
Fucking killers!

11:15.581 --> 11:17.822
Open the courtyard gate.

11:19.552 --> 11:21.759
Open the courtyard.

11:28.127 --> 11:30.971
What's the problem, man?
What's the problem?

11:38.003 --> 11:39.607
Come on, man.
Want something?

12:40.699 --> 12:43.373
Boss. Okay, boss.

12:48.340 --> 12:50.547
You all right?
Fuck you.

12:50.576 --> 12:53.989
Sir, I found this kite
in the corridor.

12:54.013 --> 12:56.254
I don't know if the inmates
are trying to communicate,

12:56.282 --> 12:57.784
but I thought you should know.

12:57.816 --> 13:00.057
All right.

13:00.085 --> 13:01.792
Be cool.

13:04.156 --> 13:07.933
I'ma get you.
Fuck you. I'ma get you.

13:14.466 --> 13:16.173
Let me see that.

13:26.912 --> 13:29.654
Whoa.

13:29.682 --> 13:31.559
The name on the manifest
says Rick.

13:31.583 --> 13:33.995
The name tag says Max.
You want to explain that?

13:34.019 --> 13:37.159
The truck rolled
over his foot yesterday.

13:37.189 --> 13:40.534
Um, I usually work dispatch.

13:40.559 --> 13:42.698
Short-staffed, so...

13:42.728 --> 13:44.799
Almost wrapped up here,
so let's get it done.

13:44.830 --> 13:48.505
Sorry, you know, I was trying
to sneak in a bit of overtime.

13:48.534 --> 13:51.481
Wife's birthday,
you know, coming up.

13:51.503 --> 13:53.540
Why don't we catch up
some other time, all right?

13:53.572 --> 13:56.815
Just get on with your job
so I can get the fuck out of here.

14:03.115 --> 14:04.788
Sanders, guard the fort.

14:23.569 --> 14:25.708
Don't tell me you fucked this up.
I don't know.

14:25.738 --> 14:27.479
All you had to do
was push a goddamn button.

14:27.506 --> 14:29.679
Sounds like something snapped.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.847
Something snapped?
Is that your professional opinion

14:31.877 --> 14:33.982
or just a wild fucking guess?

14:37.216 --> 14:39.696
Shit, I'm gonna die of old age
in this motherfucker.

14:39.718 --> 14:42.221
Get the truck, pull it out.
We need to take a look.

14:42.254 --> 14:44.165
Pull it out.

14:56.168 --> 14:58.170
Kill it. Kill it.

14:58.203 --> 15:01.776
I'm smelling diesel out here.

15:01.807 --> 15:03.753
The truck won't disengage.

15:03.776 --> 15:05.847
Something's definitely stuck
back there.

15:05.878 --> 15:08.389
You might want to call your buddies to
come down here and give you some help.

15:08.414 --> 15:10.587
Yeah, good luck with that.

15:10.616 --> 15:13.722
Friday night... everyone's
packed out till Monday.

15:13.752 --> 15:15.959
Shit.

15:17.523 --> 15:19.002
I got it.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.400
I'll see what I can do.

15:31.403 --> 15:32.746
Hey, bud, it's Manning.

15:32.771 --> 15:35.012
Hey, listen, we've got an issue
with the garbage truck.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.487
Something's jammed in there
and I'm smelling diesel fumes.

15:38.510 --> 15:41.047
Well, you know, block D
is on the same ventilation system

15:41.079 --> 15:42.456
as maintenance.

15:42.481 --> 15:45.360
Yes, sir, same place you booked in
two assets last night.

15:45.384 --> 15:47.455
Fuck. I'm gonna head
down there right now.

15:47.486 --> 15:50.160
Anyway, I'll take care of it.

15:50.189 --> 15:52.709
I don't think either of us
is gonna make it out of here tonight.

15:54.293 --> 15:56.000
Wonderful.

16:02.301 --> 16:05.214
I was about to contact you
on the radio, sir.

16:05.237 --> 16:07.274
I'm smelling diesel down here.

16:07.306 --> 16:09.877
Yeah, I know. I'm moving
the detainees as we speak.

16:09.908 --> 16:13.082
Where are we gonna put them?
Unfortunately, block G.

16:13.111 --> 16:14.749
Seriously?

16:14.780 --> 16:17.727
Those fucking guys are gonna go crazy
when they know about them.

16:17.749 --> 16:19.660
Unfortunately, I don't have
much of a choice.

16:19.685 --> 16:21.562
You know, it's only
for a couple of hours.

16:21.587 --> 16:23.464
Everybody's transferring
out tonight.

16:23.489 --> 16:25.491
So let's just do it.

16:30.796 --> 16:32.867
All right, girls,
let's go for a walk.

16:38.670 --> 16:40.843
Let's see your hands, girls.

16:41.974 --> 16:44.045
Please listen to me.

16:44.076 --> 16:45.919
I'm a foreign national.

16:45.944 --> 16:47.946
My government
has no idea where I am.

16:47.980 --> 16:50.756
Right.
And you're a political prisoner.

16:50.782 --> 16:52.762
I know.
I've heard that before, man.

16:52.784 --> 16:55.594
Every motherfucker in here
that's wrapped in skin

16:55.621 --> 16:57.066
is a political prisoner.

16:57.089 --> 16:59.569
I'm no idiot, okay?
I know what this place is

16:59.591 --> 17:01.867
and I know where
guys like you come from.

17:01.894 --> 17:04.374
If you don't help me,
then I'm dead.

17:04.396 --> 17:06.342
Went in the boiler room,
grabbed some tools.

17:06.365 --> 17:09.574
I went ahead and shut the heat down
to G block while I was there, FYI.

17:09.601 --> 17:12.343
Sure got some ugly janitors
in this dump.

17:12.371 --> 17:14.942
Who let the hooker in?
Fuck you.

17:14.973 --> 17:16.509
I did.

17:20.178 --> 17:22.180
You deal with your mess.

17:22.214 --> 17:24.887
I've got a garbage truck with my name
on it waiting for me.

17:24.916 --> 17:26.657
Call me.

17:26.685 --> 17:28.687
It was CIA this time.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.256
Please listen to me.

17:30.289 --> 17:32.166
Look, I'm a courier.

17:32.190 --> 17:34.431
My contact was
assassinated right in...

17:34.459 --> 17:36.598
In private.

17:36.628 --> 17:37.971
This time it was CIA.

17:37.996 --> 17:40.203
Look, I'm not bullshitting you.

17:40.232 --> 17:42.405
I'm trying to tell you
that if you don't listen to me,

17:42.434 --> 17:44.573
if you don't help me,
then I'm dead. I'm...

17:44.603 --> 17:47.550
You just gotta stop talking
in front of people.

17:49.474 --> 17:52.614
Please tell me you know
what the hell you're doing in there.

17:56.348 --> 17:58.555
What's your ETA, man?

17:58.584 --> 18:00.996
It's gonna be a while.

18:01.019 --> 18:03.556
The prisoners are locked
and secured in block G.

18:03.589 --> 18:06.365
I'm meeting the team.
I've got something to run by Bradley.

18:07.359 --> 18:10.738
Radio me if the transfer unit
shows up.

18:10.762 --> 18:11.763
Will do.

18:16.735 --> 18:18.737
Well, fuck me.

18:21.073 --> 18:23.383
Man, we ain't never getting out
of here at this rate.

18:23.408 --> 18:24.751
I'll take a look.

18:55.874 --> 18:58.548
Target in place.
Commence extraction.

19:07.219 --> 19:10.063
Come on, boss,
have a drink.

19:10.088 --> 19:12.864
These ladies have been waiting
for you and Manning all day.

19:15.327 --> 19:17.898
Oh, thank you.

19:17.929 --> 19:21.001
Where the hell is Bradley?
I gotta get back to the base.

19:22.668 --> 19:25.148
Hey, sorry I'm late.

19:25.170 --> 19:27.480
So where's Manning?

19:27.506 --> 19:29.110
I thought he was
coming with you.

19:29.141 --> 19:31.712
He's fucking around with that
trash compressor or some shit.

19:31.743 --> 19:34.223
And he's happy about it too.

19:35.914 --> 19:38.758
Sol heard you might have
something for me.

19:38.784 --> 19:40.957
I've got a kite

19:40.986 --> 19:44.229
that they seem to have recovered
from one of the inmates,

19:44.256 --> 19:47.829
but I got a funny feeling that this
looks like numeric and Arabic mixed.

19:47.859 --> 19:50.396
And Arabic is your deal,

19:50.429 --> 19:52.966
so have a look at that
and I'll come down in a minute.

19:55.067 --> 19:57.138
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

19:57.169 --> 19:59.479
As you know,
ciphers are numeric-based,

19:59.504 --> 20:01.506
but the Arabic is unusual.

20:01.540 --> 20:03.850
Fortunately, it's one of
my specialties.

20:14.820 --> 20:17.164
Hey, the wagon finally arrived.

20:18.457 --> 20:20.459
Looks like we're out of here
in the morning.

20:28.667 --> 20:32.046
Control unit to Manning:
transfer unit has arrived. Copy?

20:34.372 --> 20:38.115
Control unit to Manning,
transfer unit has arrived. Copy?

20:38.143 --> 20:39.952
Manning is still working
on the crusher.

20:39.978 --> 20:42.049
I'll let him know
when he comes out.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.855
Let's get Terrence on it.

20:43.882 --> 20:46.886
Terrence, this is Control.
We need you in intake.

20:46.918 --> 20:48.693
The transfer unit
is here. Copy?

20:48.720 --> 20:49.892
On my way.

20:50.922 --> 20:52.492
Wait here.

21:17.249 --> 21:21.129
It's complicated,
but my best guess is

21:21.153 --> 21:23.827
that a dirty guard
has been passing on information.

21:23.855 --> 21:25.960
That's basically an itinerary.

21:25.991 --> 21:29.336
It gives the exact pickup time
and the route the marshals are going to.

21:29.361 --> 21:31.568
Okay, so what
we're talking about

21:31.596 --> 21:34.406
is a high-risk extraction
in the making,

21:34.432 --> 21:36.139
and it's coming soon.

21:36.168 --> 21:37.772
We have little time.
Where is your gear?

21:37.803 --> 21:41.012
The gear's still at the airport.
I didn't think we'd need it.

21:41.039 --> 21:43.280
Well, always gotta be ready,
right?

21:43.308 --> 21:47.120
Listen, I'm gonna go brief Manning
and jump up ahead of you guys.

21:47.145 --> 21:49.147
You guys go tack up.
Meet me there.

21:49.181 --> 21:51.252
Go in the tunnels
off the motor pool

21:51.283 --> 21:53.786
and nobody will see you.

21:53.819 --> 21:55.495
Keep your eyes open,
your head on a swivel.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.261
Okay.

21:57.289 --> 21:59.291
All right, gentlemen,

21:59.324 --> 22:01.600
we got a fucking shit sandwich
coming on real fast.

22:01.626 --> 22:03.765
We need to tack up now.

22:03.795 --> 22:05.536
Let's go.
All right.

22:05.564 --> 22:09.376
" Happy days are here...'

22:09.401 --> 22:11.403
All right,
let's see what you got.

22:11.436 --> 22:12.946
I don't think you can handle
what I got.

22:12.971 --> 22:14.473
Come on, bring it.

22:14.506 --> 22:16.349
Oh, damn!

22:16.374 --> 22:19.150
Now, see, that was pure luck.
A pro would never take that shot.

22:19.177 --> 22:22.488
Captain Christopher Blake,
US marshal, prisoner transfer unit.

22:22.514 --> 22:24.391
You got two female
detainees for me.

22:24.416 --> 22:26.987
Personnel, be advised,

22:27.018 --> 22:29.658
please remember
to catalog all boxes

22:29.688 --> 22:32.897
according to the official
government itemized checklist.

22:34.025 --> 22:36.130
How's your Friday night?

22:40.699 --> 22:42.701
Yeah, this all seems in order,

22:42.734 --> 22:45.214
but there's only transfer papers
for two prisoners.

22:45.237 --> 22:48.411
That's what it says... Samantha Mendez
and Charlotte Walker.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.646
Problem?

22:49.674 --> 22:51.483
I heard you were supposed
to move all six.

22:53.044 --> 22:54.785
That's news to me.

22:56.481 --> 22:58.427
Well, I can't authorize
this anyway.

22:58.450 --> 23:00.396
You're gonna have to talk
to the warden.

23:00.418 --> 23:02.523
Take Marshal Blake
to see the warden.

23:02.554 --> 23:04.966
I'm gonna call Esmeralda,
see if she can stay late in the kitchen

23:04.990 --> 23:07.334
and get you boys fed.

23:08.927 --> 23:10.998
You two stay here.
You're with me.

23:54.005 --> 23:55.211
Clear.

24:07.719 --> 24:10.461
I've been through that thing
from top to bottom.

24:10.488 --> 24:12.490
Nothing's wrong
with the crusher.

24:12.524 --> 24:14.800
Gotta be the goddamn truck.

24:14.826 --> 24:17.170
Fire that son of a bitch
back up.

24:23.201 --> 24:26.273
What?

24:26.304 --> 24:29.251
I said what?
Is everybody deaf around here?

24:29.274 --> 24:32.153
Warden, Captain Christopher Blake,

24:32.177 --> 24:34.248
US Marshal,
Prisoner Transfer Unit.

24:34.279 --> 24:37.192
You have two female detainees
for me to pick up.

24:39.584 --> 24:42.758
Well, I sympathize
with your predicament, Marshal,

24:42.787 --> 24:45.131
but it seems that nobody has
any concern for mine.

24:45.156 --> 24:48.035
I got a schedule to keep.
You got the documentation.

24:48.059 --> 24:49.595
I'm not asking you
for any favors.

24:49.627 --> 24:53.803
The detainees are going
from a military to a federal facility.

24:53.832 --> 24:56.472
Your paperwork requires
the correct signature.

24:56.501 --> 24:58.481
It doesn't happen to be mine.

24:58.503 --> 25:00.744
We can fix the paperwork.
Warden,

25:00.772 --> 25:03.343
I'm working in cooperation
with the CIA.

25:03.375 --> 25:06.356
They have a special interest
in these two detainees.

25:06.378 --> 25:07.954
Bring it.
Want some of this? Huh? Huh?

25:07.979 --> 25:09.583
I don't think you do.
Come on.

25:09.614 --> 25:11.821
Oh!
Oh. See?

25:11.850 --> 25:14.023
Want a coffee, loser?
Yeah.

25:14.052 --> 25:16.965
Yeah, okay.
Hey, two sugars this time.

25:16.988 --> 25:18.160
Sure.

25:20.425 --> 25:24.202
♪ You lift me up
and carry me away... ♪

25:26.164 --> 25:28.405
Put in manual access,
back in a minute.

25:32.537 --> 25:35.108
D-436, anybody.

25:35.140 --> 25:37.120
This is headquarters.

25:37.142 --> 25:39.645
D-436, anybody.

25:39.677 --> 25:41.679
This is headquarters.

25:41.713 --> 25:43.954
This is MP Terrence Davis, sir.

25:43.982 --> 25:46.087
What's your status?

25:46.117 --> 25:48.996
The transfer unit just arrived.
They're talking to the warden.

25:49.020 --> 25:52.126
They only had the paperwork
to transfer two detainees.

25:52.157 --> 25:54.660
Where's Manning?

25:54.692 --> 25:57.832
Still dealing
with the garbage issue, sir.

25:57.862 --> 26:01.275
All right, look, man, nobody moves.
Wait till I get there.

26:01.299 --> 26:04.678
Do not release the PIs.
Do not release the prisoners.

26:04.702 --> 26:06.704
Nobody moves till I get there.

26:06.738 --> 26:08.149
Copy that, sir.

26:10.141 --> 26:13.122
Sounds like a vibrator
my wife used to have.

26:13.144 --> 26:15.556
Keep rigging it.

26:17.248 --> 26:19.660
Something's gonna snap.

26:19.684 --> 26:21.925
No fucking shit.
That's the idea.

26:21.953 --> 26:24.024
I want to break
whatever's in there.

26:24.055 --> 26:26.831
I'm not staying in this
son of a bitch all night.

26:26.858 --> 26:30.203
CIA can shove their gratitude
up their ass.

26:33.164 --> 26:35.440
Cross signed them in
on his authority.

26:35.467 --> 26:37.504
You need his signature
to get them out.

26:38.536 --> 26:40.379
I'm not here
to make your life easier.

26:40.405 --> 26:42.885
Boy, you got that right.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.518
So where the fuck are they?

26:59.958 --> 27:00.993
Hey.

27:01.025 --> 27:03.198
Put the coffees down.

27:03.228 --> 27:05.538
Sit in the chair and open
the doors I tell you to open

27:05.563 --> 27:08.407
when I tell you to open them,
and nobody gets hurt.

27:10.902 --> 27:12.074
Fuck you.

27:12.103 --> 27:13.878
What? Wait, no.

27:24.816 --> 27:26.727
Begin phase two.

27:26.751 --> 27:28.253
That's our signal.
On your feet.

27:28.286 --> 27:30.789
Light it up.

27:36.261 --> 27:39.265
It's working again.

27:42.534 --> 27:45.037
Ready to charge now.
Everyone stand back.

27:45.069 --> 27:47.140
Charge, one minute.

27:58.550 --> 28:00.086
What's that noise?

28:24.442 --> 28:25.978
Time to charge.

28:26.010 --> 28:27.489
Ready?

28:27.512 --> 28:28.991
Fire in the hole.

28:29.013 --> 28:30.492
Fuck.

28:30.515 --> 28:32.825
Password, password, password.

28:32.850 --> 28:34.852
What the fuck is the password?

28:40.258 --> 28:42.499
It's inside the crusher.

28:46.564 --> 28:48.771
Clear the blast zone.
Clear!

28:48.800 --> 28:49.938
Get down.

28:59.277 --> 29:01.223
This is Terrence, sir.

29:01.246 --> 29:03.624
I don't know about Manning,
but I just heard an explosion.

29:19.130 --> 29:20.165
Secured?

29:20.198 --> 29:22.735
If the MP and the security guard
are dead,

29:22.767 --> 29:24.906
then, yeah, we're secured.

29:24.936 --> 29:26.643
Good.

29:41.819 --> 29:44.959
Easy payday.
Why don't we get the girl?

29:46.124 --> 29:47.865
Where are they?

29:47.892 --> 29:50.873
I don't know what you're
talking about.

29:50.895 --> 29:52.738
Who the fuck do you think
I'm talking about?

29:52.764 --> 29:54.801
The two that were
brought in here last night.

29:54.832 --> 29:58.245
Oh, yes. I can tell you.
They're in... they're in...

29:58.269 --> 29:59.771
Where are they, God damn it?

29:59.804 --> 30:01.545
Cross reopened block D.

30:01.572 --> 30:03.574
Block D.

30:03.608 --> 30:05.781
Light up cell block D.

30:05.810 --> 30:08.188
I want to be out of here
in 15 minutes.

30:08.212 --> 30:09.623
COPY.

30:16.421 --> 30:18.492
It's that way.

30:18.523 --> 30:20.400
Control, can you see us?

30:25.797 --> 30:26.969
I see you. Hold.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.943
What's the problem?

30:32.937 --> 30:35.214
I don't know, man. He must have
put it on manual when I came in.

30:35.239 --> 30:37.241
I need the fucking password.

30:39.477 --> 30:41.616
I need your password
to open doors.

30:41.646 --> 30:43.216
I don't have a password.

30:43.247 --> 30:45.557
Then I'm gonna find
someone who does.

30:45.583 --> 30:47.927
Please, no.
Control room... in the control room,

30:47.952 --> 30:50.296
there's a fingerprint scanner
on the board.

30:50.321 --> 30:53.461
It gives me access to all
the sensitive systems in an emergency.

30:55.059 --> 30:56.936
What are you gonna do?

30:56.961 --> 30:59.100
Move, God damn it.
What finger?

30:59.130 --> 31:00.973
No.

31:00.998 --> 31:03.478
Which finger?
No!

31:10.675 --> 31:11.983
This finger?

31:12.009 --> 31:15.582
My finger.
you cut my finger off. Fuck.

31:19.751 --> 31:21.791
Do I need to cutoff another one?
Please, please.

31:21.819 --> 31:24.322
I can take you there.

31:24.355 --> 31:26.494
There's 50 keys here.

31:26.524 --> 31:28.470
I know which ones to use.

31:28.493 --> 31:30.234
Let me show you.
It'll be faster.

31:30.261 --> 31:32.468
Please don't kill me.

31:32.497 --> 31:34.704
Please.

31:35.700 --> 31:38.340
Suit yourself.

31:38.369 --> 31:41.350
Control, I'm on my way.

31:41.372 --> 31:43.181
I've got access to the board.

31:48.346 --> 31:49.689
Let's go.
Okay.

31:52.683 --> 31:52.783
This one MP,

31:52.784 --> 31:55.230
This one MP,

31:55.253 --> 31:57.233
the security guy... Manning.

31:57.255 --> 32:00.236
looked like ex-special ops,

32:00.258 --> 32:02.431
a big, bald asshole.

32:02.460 --> 32:04.940
No offense.

32:04.962 --> 32:06.964
Just find them.

32:06.998 --> 32:09.205
Confirm that they're dead.

32:16.808 --> 32:18.810
Here's one of them.

32:27.118 --> 32:29.155
That's him! Waste him!

32:31.189 --> 32:33.032
Secure the area.

32:33.057 --> 32:34.229
Max, with me.

32:48.906 --> 32:51.682
One more idiot play like that
and I'll blow your head off myself.

35:47.585 --> 35:50.031
The main gate
to the holding area is secure.

35:58.029 --> 35:59.770
Who are you?

35:59.797 --> 36:02.641
Special Agent Watkins.
I have an appointment with the warden

36:02.667 --> 36:04.772
about some kind of
narcotics activity here.

36:04.802 --> 36:07.043
We're doing a high-risk
security transfer here.

36:07.071 --> 36:08.573
We're gonna have to
ask you to leave.

36:08.606 --> 36:11.143
All right.

36:37.168 --> 36:39.170
Team two.
Respond, team two.

36:39.203 --> 36:42.582
All right, head up, Bradley.
We've got active hostiles up in here.

36:42.606 --> 36:44.381
10-4. En route.

36:45.443 --> 36:47.218
Team two, respond.

36:56.754 --> 36:59.496
We have another issue.

36:59.523 --> 37:02.766
How many parts of your job
have you managed to fuck up today?

37:02.793 --> 37:04.534
Not me.

37:04.562 --> 37:06.508
Team two has been compromised.

37:06.530 --> 37:08.510
What's the damage?

37:08.532 --> 37:10.773
Terminated.

37:10.801 --> 37:13.213
Got some guy coming in through
prisoner intake, came out of nowhere.

37:13.237 --> 37:15.239
Whoa, whoa.

37:15.272 --> 37:17.752
He's changed into full tactical.
This guy means business.

37:17.775 --> 37:19.982
Shit. Let's go.

37:26.350 --> 37:28.523
Control, we got a security expert
on the loose...

37:28.552 --> 37:30.554
Manning... conversant
in special ops.

37:30.588 --> 37:32.628
He went through the south boiler.
Can you track him?

37:32.656 --> 37:34.233
Don't see him.
He must be off the grid.

37:34.258 --> 37:36.169
I need access now,
or I'm gonna start blowing doors.

37:36.193 --> 37:37.866
And track Manning.
He's bad news.

37:37.895 --> 37:39.897
Stand down, Collins.
That's an order.

37:39.930 --> 37:43.002
Your priority is the target
in cell block D.

37:43.033 --> 37:45.411
Fields, do you have a visual?

37:47.204 --> 37:50.378
Nothing but empty cell blocks.

37:50.407 --> 37:52.512
What about
the rest of the prison?

37:52.543 --> 37:54.454
Nothing.
We have two internal MP-s

37:54.478 --> 37:56.048
in the ultra max sector,
no threat.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.855
No visual on the target.

37:57.882 --> 38:00.829
Find her.

38:00.851 --> 38:03.161
It's this way.
Let's go.

38:17.468 --> 38:19.607
Yo, the guy from the cell blocks
is moving.

38:20.638 --> 38:22.276
Track him.

38:22.306 --> 38:25.219
Let me know if he stumbles
into our kill zone.

38:25.242 --> 38:28.189
We'll isolate and extract him
after we've secured the target.

38:28.212 --> 38:29.486
You understand?

38:29.513 --> 38:30.719
Copy.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.712
Cross's last radio transmit said
there were active hostiles.

38:59.743 --> 39:02.553
At this stage, we have to assume
it's an extraction.

39:02.580 --> 39:05.186
We've got minimal gear and ammo,
so we go in quiet

39:05.216 --> 39:07.093
through the old
hydro-access tunnels.

39:07.117 --> 39:09.893
We make every shot count.
We good?

39:09.920 --> 39:11.797
Yeah.
Let's go.

39:13.190 --> 39:15.192
Come on.

39:18.762 --> 39:21.368
Intel on the target.
What the fuck happened to you?

39:21.398 --> 39:24.538
They needed some convincing.
Target confirmed.

39:24.568 --> 39:26.343
The location of the data
is unknown so far.

39:26.370 --> 39:27.849
Shit.

39:34.778 --> 39:36.155
Open the doors to L block.

39:41.886 --> 39:43.695
We have guests.

39:43.721 --> 39:45.997
Fuck.

39:47.224 --> 39:49.602
Ready? Three, two one.

39:56.033 --> 39:58.035
Who the hell are those guys?

40:00.204 --> 40:01.774
Who the fuck are they?

40:01.805 --> 40:03.876
Cross and Manning
were waiting for a team,

40:03.908 --> 40:05.751
the HSO team
I think they called it.

40:07.044 --> 40:10.025
Why were they waiting for
a high-speed operating team?

40:10.047 --> 40:12.459
Cross... that's the guy in holding.

40:12.483 --> 40:16.397
he's a private contractor,
trains teams like that,

40:16.420 --> 40:18.627
one of those shadow guys,
ex-Special Forces.

40:18.656 --> 40:21.330
He came in to shut down the site,
brought in Manning.

40:22.559 --> 40:25.563
Collins, we have an intrusion
in the motor pool...

40:25.596 --> 40:27.872
a three-man HSO team.
Stand by.

40:27.898 --> 40:29.675
I'm gonna shut off the power
in the cell blocks.

40:29.700 --> 40:32.180
Get your people in there now.

40:32.202 --> 40:33.704
10-4.

40:33.737 --> 40:36.217
Team one, sweep sector seven,
kill everyone.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.117
Teams two and three,
set up perimeter defenses.

40:38.142 --> 40:40.679
My team, tight to me.
Let's move.

42:02.026 --> 42:03.972
Motherfucker.

42:03.994 --> 42:05.996
Boo.

42:06.030 --> 42:08.533
God damn, it's getting funnier
every time I do it.

42:09.933 --> 42:12.209
Yeah, well, see if I come to save
your ass next time.

42:12.236 --> 42:13.442
Save my ass?

42:13.470 --> 42:15.472
Fuck.

42:16.607 --> 42:19.611
Well, I'm glad to see
you're still breathing.

42:19.643 --> 42:22.180
So what have we got?
I made contact with those assholes.

42:22.212 --> 42:24.055
They're after one of
the female detainees.

42:24.081 --> 42:26.425
Sounded like she had some info
somebody wanted.

42:26.450 --> 42:29.090
So where's Cross?
Fucked if I know. He's not with you?

42:29.119 --> 42:31.531
No, he said he'd meet us
up here.

42:32.656 --> 42:34.192
They'll be going after him.

42:34.224 --> 42:36.329
We need to assess
enemy strength,

42:36.360 --> 42:38.670
engage, kill,
clear access for him.

42:38.695 --> 42:41.266
He'll find us.
You got gear?

42:41.298 --> 42:42.709
Not much.

42:42.733 --> 42:44.371
Hand it over.

42:44.401 --> 42:46.438
A little more effective
than a screwdriver.

42:46.470 --> 42:47.980
A screwdriver worked on you,
didn't it?

42:48.005 --> 42:49.609
Yeah.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.642
You need to wake up.

42:55.913 --> 42:58.086
No sign of him.
Hallway clear.

42:58.115 --> 42:59.685
Go, go.

43:15.732 --> 43:18.235
They're gonna sweep past
on a perimeter check.

43:18.268 --> 43:20.077
They know we're here.

43:21.805 --> 43:25.014
We need to get off this video grid
and buy some real estate.

43:25.042 --> 43:26.885
Move.

43:44.294 --> 43:46.467
Hold up.

43:46.497 --> 43:48.875
I think I see something.

43:48.899 --> 43:51.402
Contact, 12.

43:51.435 --> 43:54.006
I hear them. They should be
right through this door.

43:58.675 --> 44:00.245
Move it!

44:20.797 --> 44:22.936
Clear.

44:36.380 --> 44:38.860
Clear. Dead check.

44:38.882 --> 44:40.293
Okay, stay tight.

44:43.187 --> 44:45.861
Grab the radio.
We can track their movements.

44:45.889 --> 44:47.891
Got it.

45:01.738 --> 45:03.911
Got Cross again.

45:05.609 --> 45:07.714
You said these guys were
ex-Special Forces?

45:07.744 --> 45:09.087
Yeah.

45:09.112 --> 45:11.820
The background is
Cross is an operational genius

45:11.848 --> 45:15.421
and Manning's a weapons expert,
a bulldozer on the ground.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.324
I guarantee
when they find each other,

45:18.355 --> 45:20.357
we'll be facing
a coordinated assault.

45:21.658 --> 45:25.299
Collins, you have got
to ramp it up and get it done.

45:25.329 --> 45:27.775
Divert more men
to sector seven now.

45:29.466 --> 45:32.174
There's no MPs.
Where are the prisoners?

45:32.202 --> 45:33.704
Should be
near the door.

45:42.579 --> 45:44.581
They're not here.

45:45.649 --> 45:47.595
Please, no, no, no.

45:48.752 --> 45:51.790
Tell me where she is,
or I'm done being nice.

45:51.822 --> 45:54.803
Oh, God, I don't...

45:54.825 --> 45:57.101
I overheard Cross and Manning

45:57.127 --> 45:59.607
on the radio, a security thing.

45:59.630 --> 46:02.509
Because of the garbage truck,
they must have moved them.

46:04.201 --> 46:06.408
Where? Where?

46:06.436 --> 46:09.383
There's only one other
open block.

46:19.416 --> 46:21.692
G block, go.

46:48.679 --> 46:50.716
Terrence, are you still there?

46:50.747 --> 46:52.954
Yes, sir.
Do you want me to meet you?

46:52.983 --> 46:56.157
No, sit tight and keep your head down
or it will probably get blown off.

46:59.923 --> 47:01.925
Copy that.

47:07.731 --> 47:10.211
Esmeralda, come on.
What's going on?

47:10.233 --> 47:12.406
We have to hide, come on.
No. No.

47:12.436 --> 47:14.279
We have to stay low.
You have to stay quiet.

47:14.304 --> 47:17.046
Okay, this way, then. This way.
No, no, this way, come on.

47:17.074 --> 47:19.281
Let go of me.
Esmeralda, look,

47:19.309 --> 47:21.619
I will keep you safe.
I promise.

47:21.645 --> 47:22.988
Okay?
Okay

47:23.013 --> 47:24.515
Come on.

47:26.516 --> 47:28.518
There you go. Shh.

48:50.867 --> 48:50.900
Where are you going?
What's going on?

48:50.901 --> 48:53.848
Where are you going?
What's going on?

49:05.348 --> 49:06.520
Sorry.

49:06.550 --> 49:08.689
I just didn't want
any friendly accidents.

49:09.686 --> 49:11.996
Cross, it's me.

49:13.223 --> 49:15.328
What's going on?

49:15.358 --> 49:17.634
It's a targeted extraction.

49:17.661 --> 49:19.231
They're killing
anybody they see,

49:19.262 --> 49:20.772
so we want to kill them
first, you hear?

49:20.797 --> 49:23.573
So we should get the hell out of here.
Negative.

49:23.600 --> 49:26.308
If somebody comes,
I'll lay down cover fire

49:26.336 --> 49:28.577
and buy you time.
Do it.

49:34.077 --> 49:36.523
All right, watch your
partners' backs.

49:36.546 --> 49:38.651
They're gonna try to track me
on security cams,

49:38.682 --> 49:42.186
so if you can pin them down,
buy me some time.

49:46.723 --> 49:49.670
Hey, what's going on
out there?

49:49.693 --> 49:53.106
Fuck, what's going on?

49:53.129 --> 49:55.439
What the hell?

50:13.116 --> 50:15.858
Jesus, finally.
You took long enough.

50:15.886 --> 50:19.265
I went over your file.
I've been in this game long enough

50:19.289 --> 50:21.326
to know that someone
has phonied it up.

50:21.358 --> 50:22.769
You still think I'm crazy?

50:22.792 --> 50:26.672
Which means probably
someone wants you dead.

50:26.696 --> 50:29.973
If you listen to me,
do what I say,

50:30.000 --> 50:33.538
I'll kill them
before they kill you, you hear?

50:41.611 --> 50:44.649
Now, I don't know exactly
how you fit in this picture.

50:44.681 --> 50:48.857
I'm assuming either you're
with them or you're with me.

50:48.885 --> 50:51.832
The long and the short is,
do what I say,

50:51.855 --> 50:55.234
be smart... you'll do well.

50:55.258 --> 50:57.260
If you don't listen to me

50:57.294 --> 51:00.537
and I find for one reason
or another you're with them

51:00.564 --> 51:02.566
or you make a false move,

51:02.599 --> 51:04.840
I'll kill you
just like I kill them.

51:04.868 --> 51:06.643
We cool?

51:06.670 --> 51:08.206
All right, come on over
to my left.

51:08.238 --> 51:11.185
You stay on my right,
stay a little bit behind me,

51:11.207 --> 51:13.346
and let's go.

52:15.171 --> 52:16.707
You three, with me.

52:16.740 --> 52:18.913
You two, take out the MP

52:18.942 --> 52:21.286
and sweep the block
for the target. Go.

52:31.354 --> 52:32.924
Section G clear.

52:32.956 --> 52:35.630
Open all the doors in G block.
Lock everything else down.

52:35.659 --> 52:37.434
I want my men to have
a clear run in there.

52:37.460 --> 52:39.098
You can't do that.

52:39.129 --> 52:41.740
That sector houses high-risk detainees.
You can't let those animals out.

52:41.765 --> 52:43.904
Do it.
You got it.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.818
So what's your story?

53:25.842 --> 53:29.881
I'm a courier for
a non-US intelligence agency.

53:29.913 --> 53:33.258
Sometimes I work with friendlies
and sometimes enemies,

53:33.283 --> 53:35.593
but all of it
off the official radar.

53:35.618 --> 53:39.464
My contact on my last drop
was a CIA op.

53:41.391 --> 53:43.371
So how did you get here?

53:43.393 --> 53:46.067
Well, my contact
was assassinated

53:46.096 --> 53:49.202
and then all channels went dark.

53:49.232 --> 53:51.769
I got away
and then I got picked up.

53:54.370 --> 53:55.815
And then I ended up here.

53:55.839 --> 53:58.410
Now I got one message
from my handlers.

53:58.441 --> 54:02.389
to sit tight because there was
some kind of internal problem...

54:02.412 --> 54:04.619
and then nothing.

54:06.015 --> 54:09.053
We'll talk about that.
Let's keep moving.

54:17.861 --> 54:21.274
Hold up.
Don't move. Don't breathe.

54:39.949 --> 54:41.257
What's up?

54:41.284 --> 54:44.857
Mines. Cut one of the beams,
they go off.

54:44.888 --> 54:47.129
We can't go that way.
Follow me.

54:49.893 --> 54:53.568
Corridor six clear.
Heading to the rendezvous point.

55:27.430 --> 55:30.604
So do you know
who killed your contact?

55:30.633 --> 55:33.443
It felt like a CIA kill squad.

55:33.469 --> 55:35.915
I've seen them do the thing
a dozen times. It was classic.

55:35.939 --> 55:38.249
So they were trying to isolate you
and retrieve information.

55:38.274 --> 55:40.276
What are you carrying?

55:40.310 --> 55:42.483
You tell me.
You know the drill.

55:42.512 --> 55:44.116
They don't tell me anything.

55:44.147 --> 55:46.855
They upload the information
onto an implant.

55:46.883 --> 55:49.090
It's usually
military intelligence.

55:49.118 --> 55:50.188
Where's the implant?

55:50.220 --> 55:52.962
It's right there.

55:54.023 --> 55:55.661
Yeah, I've seen those before.

55:55.692 --> 55:58.969
You can upload and download data
via a short-range transmission,

55:58.995 --> 56:02.408
but the chip also monitors
the electrical impulses of your heart.

56:04.601 --> 56:06.808
The problem is

56:06.836 --> 56:09.510
if you get killed,
it wipes the intel.

56:12.141 --> 56:14.644
Are the police at least
gonna come and help us?

56:14.677 --> 56:18.124
Sweetheart, this is a top secret
military dark facility.

56:18.147 --> 56:20.525
The police do not know
about this place,

56:20.550 --> 56:22.154
never could, never will.

56:22.185 --> 56:25.359
But you don't have to worry, 'cause
if somebody tries to come and kill you,

56:25.388 --> 56:27.925
they gotta come through me
and my friends.

56:27.957 --> 56:29.959
What's that noise?

56:29.993 --> 56:32.033
Pipes, man. They run
all the way through the prison.

56:32.061 --> 56:34.063
The inmates use them
to communicate.

56:34.097 --> 56:35.735
I have an MP held up
in the kitchen.

56:35.765 --> 56:37.767
He's trying to let us know
he's all right.

56:40.203 --> 56:42.513
Hey, boss man.

56:42.538 --> 56:44.779
Charlotte, get over here.
Now get down.

56:44.807 --> 56:46.809
Hey, boss man.

56:46.843 --> 56:49.414
We know you got some women back there.
Just give us one.

56:49.445 --> 56:51.447
We'll take our frustrations
out on her.

56:51.481 --> 56:55.691
Or you could fuck her yourself
and just give us your keys.

56:55.718 --> 56:57.288
I got a better idea.

56:57.320 --> 56:59.561
Why don't you fuck your mama
and one of your pet poodles?

57:04.360 --> 57:07.398
They found the weapons.

58:26.809 --> 58:29.551
Does that hurt?
Yeah.

58:29.579 --> 58:31.456
You fucking pussy.

58:45.228 --> 58:48.402
I have the asset and confirmation
of the chip implant and location.

58:48.431 --> 58:49.842
Cross is right behind me.

58:49.866 --> 58:52.904
Get to the extraction point.

58:52.935 --> 58:54.812
How do you want me
to do that? I'm lost.

58:54.837 --> 58:57.977
You see where she is? What's
the quickest way to the garbage room?

58:58.007 --> 59:00.487
It's hard to say.

59:00.510 --> 59:03.514
If you want to keep on breathing,
you'd better figure it out.

59:03.546 --> 59:05.958
From where she is,

59:05.982 --> 59:07.984
she'd have to go
through the kitchen

59:08.017 --> 59:10.190
and then skirt B and C blocks.

59:12.121 --> 59:14.123
Collins, we have the asset.

59:14.157 --> 59:17.297
She's being pursued by Cross
towards the kitchen in your sector.

59:17.326 --> 59:19.397
Take out Cross,
rendezvous with Charlotte,

59:19.429 --> 59:21.841
and get her
to the extraction point.

59:21.864 --> 59:24.310
Rendezvous with Collins in the kitchen.
We'll open the doors.

59:24.333 --> 59:26.335
Head to the kitchen.

59:53.062 --> 59:55.975
Happy to see a familiar face?

59:57.767 --> 59:59.678
Manning, contact, 12.

01:00:31.601 --> 01:00:32.773
Pull back.

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:36.249
Pull back.

01:00:40.977 --> 01:00:43.082
Hold your fire.

01:00:51.387 --> 01:00:53.094
Having fun yet?

01:00:53.122 --> 01:00:54.726
Fuck, I'm having a blast.

01:00:54.757 --> 01:00:57.533
We've been clearing these
motherfuckers as we find them.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.666
They're heading for the kitchen.
You want to hit that bitch together?

01:01:00.696 --> 01:01:02.972
I'd love to, but unfortunately
they're too mobile.

01:01:02.999 --> 01:01:05.001
She'll be gone
before we get there.

01:01:05.034 --> 01:01:06.980
I need to hit the control room.

01:01:07.003 --> 01:01:09.244
Now I can track her from there.

01:01:09.272 --> 01:01:11.377
We've got time,
'cause they can't kill her yet.

01:01:11.407 --> 01:01:13.478
Clear.

01:01:13.509 --> 01:01:15.921
Another little problem.

01:01:15.945 --> 01:01:18.755
we have one of the MP-s
held up in the kitchen

01:01:18.781 --> 01:01:20.624
and the bad guys
are headed that way.

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:23.494
Shit. Poor motherfucker
ain't got a chance.

01:01:23.519 --> 01:01:26.966
Let me see what I can do.
Yes, sir.

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:29.026
You guys, I want you
to sweep up the rear,

01:01:29.058 --> 01:01:31.129
make sure Manning's six is clear.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.766
I'll radio when I hit the target.

01:01:35.031 --> 01:01:37.033
All right, let's do it.

01:01:47.577 --> 01:01:49.955
Do you think anyone heard
your signals?

01:01:59.188 --> 01:02:01.464
No, wait.

01:02:09.365 --> 01:02:11.902
Kitchen, I have movement
by cold storage.

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:41.034
Shut up. Bring them over here now.

01:02:42.932 --> 01:02:45.037
It's Terrence... an MP.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.982
Tell Cross and Manning
everything is clear down here.

01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:55.887
Tell them you have the girl.

01:02:59.749 --> 01:03:02.855
This is Terrence.
We are in the kitchen.

01:03:10.226 --> 01:03:12.672
It's a trap.
Mayday, Mayday!

01:03:12.695 --> 01:03:15.642
No!

01:03:47.229 --> 01:03:49.402
We have the asset.

01:03:49.432 --> 01:03:53.107
Get her out of the kitchens.
Send her to the extraction point.

01:03:53.135 --> 01:03:55.137
Copy that.

01:04:06.982 --> 01:04:09.986
Contact,
I have movement.

01:04:13.622 --> 01:04:16.034
Looks like Manning's coming
through your sector.

01:04:16.058 --> 01:04:17.093
Where?

01:04:23.999 --> 01:04:25.843
I lost him.
He's got to be there somewhere.

01:04:25.868 --> 01:04:27.870
Extraction in 10 minutes.

01:04:27.903 --> 01:04:29.905
Fan out.

01:04:29.939 --> 01:04:33.079
Mess with me, I'll gouge your
eyes out with my fingers.

01:08:05.955 --> 01:08:07.593
Make a noise, you die.

01:08:40.089 --> 01:08:41.898
Hey, are you okay?

01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:53.268
You like that shit?

01:08:55.237 --> 01:08:56.978
What the fuck, baby?

01:09:22.665 --> 01:09:25.009
Holy shit.

01:09:25.033 --> 01:09:27.241
My kind of woman.

01:09:50.192 --> 01:09:53.036
You think you're going to enjoy
yourself, baby cakes?

01:09:54.063 --> 01:09:55.303
I don't.

01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:57.901
I'm gonna take good care of you.

01:09:57.933 --> 01:10:00.140
No! No. No!

01:10:01.537 --> 01:10:04.211
No. No!

01:10:04.239 --> 01:10:05.912
Shut up, bitch!

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:11.448
Please stop.
Please stop.

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.428
You're gonna-
you're gonna like it.

01:10:17.453 --> 01:10:18.625
Oh, yeah.

01:10:18.654 --> 01:10:20.656
No!

01:10:27.696 --> 01:10:29.198
Where's the asset?

01:10:29.231 --> 01:10:32.007
We've been in here too long already.
We have to move.

01:10:33.035 --> 01:10:34.537
Working on it.

01:10:38.774 --> 01:10:41.277
No. No.

01:10:43.445 --> 01:10:44.981
Come here.

01:10:45.013 --> 01:10:48.654
No. No. No.

01:10:53.989 --> 01:10:56.902
Hey, fuckhead, over here.

01:11:00.996 --> 01:11:02.498
Fresh meat.

01:11:24.486 --> 01:11:27.865
Yes, bitch?

01:11:43.472 --> 01:11:46.453
Bitch!

01:12:47.236 --> 01:12:49.614
Back to business.

01:13:00.782 --> 01:13:02.853
I'm gonna give you something
to think about.

01:13:02.885 --> 01:13:06.628
See, you're lucky. I was gonna
kill you and cut the chip out.

01:13:06.655 --> 01:13:08.999
But now I know I can't do that.

01:13:09.024 --> 01:13:12.631
It's a good thing I didn't
fuck up Cross before I found out.

01:13:12.661 --> 01:13:14.868
So you're not gonna die just yet,

01:13:14.897 --> 01:13:17.878
not before I get that data
scanned out of you.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.402
When I do,

01:13:19.434 --> 01:13:22.347
guess where
I'm gonna stick this?

01:13:29.444 --> 01:13:31.856
Got the bitch.
What's the situation?

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.884
Let's bounce.
Open everything... all doors.

01:13:34.917 --> 01:13:39.059
Get out of there and meet me
at the extraction point with the asset.

01:13:40.455 --> 01:13:42.799
Garbage room... show me.

01:13:42.824 --> 01:13:44.497
Now.

01:13:44.526 --> 01:13:46.904
Come on, come on.

01:14:04.313 --> 01:14:07.624
I should have known you were a plant
when they picked you up from state pen.

01:14:07.649 --> 01:14:10.858
No con fights like that.
You're goddamn CIA.

01:14:10.886 --> 01:14:12.058
So what if I am?

01:14:12.087 --> 01:14:13.862
So you're supposed to be
on my side.

01:14:13.889 --> 01:14:16.028
Says who?

01:14:16.058 --> 01:14:18.402
My contact was CIA.

01:14:19.761 --> 01:14:22.401
Why are you doing this?

01:14:22.431 --> 01:14:24.604
We both want the same things.

01:14:24.633 --> 01:14:26.271
We're both helping
our countries.

01:14:26.301 --> 01:14:29.874
No, you just want to feel good
about yourself and I want to get paid.

01:14:29.905 --> 01:14:31.782
You're so fucking dumb,
you didn't even know

01:14:31.807 --> 01:14:34.447
what you were handing your contact
before we capped him.

01:14:34.476 --> 01:14:36.649
If you did, you'd be lying
on a beach somewhere by now

01:14:36.678 --> 01:14:39.215
with a different face,
laughing at all of us.

01:14:39.247 --> 01:14:41.523
Too bad for you.

01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:43.052
Come on.

01:15:14.983 --> 01:15:17.395
Cross, they have the target.

01:15:17.419 --> 01:15:19.057
Rendezvous
with the team.

01:15:19.087 --> 01:15:21.897
We'll meet up at the extraction point
in the garbage room.

01:15:35.737 --> 01:15:39.685
Charlotte, where are you?
Let's go. I want that package.

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:44.187
Getting there. They didn't give me
a map when they booked me in.

01:15:44.212 --> 01:15:46.590
This wasn't supposed
to be my job.

01:15:47.916 --> 01:15:51.159
Look, you hit F block,
then C block.

01:15:51.186 --> 01:15:52.688
Let's move it.

01:15:55.023 --> 01:15:56.058
Move it.

01:16:04.833 --> 01:16:06.779
What the fuck happened to you?

01:16:06.802 --> 01:16:10.306
Got my ass whupped
by my new girlfriend.

01:16:10.338 --> 01:16:13.217
They acquired the target.
Cross will be tracking her.

01:16:13.241 --> 01:16:15.619
The extraction point
is the garbage room.

01:16:15.644 --> 01:16:17.954
Cross wants to lock down
all the doors,

01:16:17.979 --> 01:16:19.515
contain the extraction team.

01:16:19.548 --> 01:16:22.654
You have five minutes to meet up.
Use what you can to get out.

01:16:22.684 --> 01:16:25.228
I'm gonna circle around the back, make
sure they don't hit us from the rear.

01:16:25.253 --> 01:16:27.096
All right, got it.
Move.

01:16:27.122 --> 01:16:28.829
Boys.

01:17:02.157 --> 01:17:04.569
Time to lock it up.
It's my game now.

01:17:22.744 --> 01:17:24.746
We're trapped.

01:17:24.779 --> 01:17:25.951
Where?

01:17:25.981 --> 01:17:27.654
F block, covered walkway.

01:17:27.682 --> 01:17:29.457
I've got keys, but it's gonna
slow me down.

01:17:29.484 --> 01:17:31.521
We're right behind you.

01:17:31.553 --> 01:17:32.827
Move.

01:17:32.854 --> 01:17:34.856
Warden,

01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:37.302
get out your goddamn keys.

01:18:00.582 --> 01:18:02.789
Open the fucking gate.

01:18:02.817 --> 01:18:04.797
Why do you keep
putting your keys away, huh?

01:18:04.819 --> 01:18:06.321
Are you clowning around with me?

01:18:06.354 --> 01:18:07.958
Huh? Are you
clowning with me?

01:18:07.989 --> 01:18:09.263
Please.

01:18:09.291 --> 01:18:11.328
It's not far.

01:18:12.327 --> 01:18:14.307
Move it.

01:18:23.238 --> 01:18:24.410
Whoa.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.950
What the fuck
are you guys doing, huh?

01:18:29.244 --> 01:18:32.453
Get to the extraction point now.
Secure the area.

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.426
Go, go.

01:18:34.449 --> 01:18:36.292
Hold it.

01:18:39.054 --> 01:18:40.294
Come on.

01:18:40.322 --> 01:18:42.233
Come on, come on, Warden.

01:18:49.564 --> 01:18:51.635
Oh, fuck.

01:18:53.401 --> 01:18:56.507
All right, maintenance room
should only be 100 yards from here.

01:18:56.538 --> 01:18:58.540
Let's start blowing doors.

01:19:41.216 --> 01:19:44.356
If I'm gonna die, you son of a bitch,
I'm taking you with me.

01:19:49.457 --> 01:19:51.459
Secure the door.

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.062
Come on, jerk-off,
get going.

01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:03.479
Okay, Warden, you were great.

01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:30.637
The implant is
just below her left breast.

01:20:30.665 --> 01:20:33.043
You need some kind of
special scanner to get it out.

01:20:33.068 --> 01:20:35.070
Just shut the fuck up
for five minutes.

01:20:35.103 --> 01:20:37.606
I've done this about 50 times.
I know what I'm doing.

01:20:37.639 --> 01:20:39.175
Watch my back.

01:21:01.563 --> 01:21:04.066
I am so gonna enjoy this.

01:21:06.301 --> 01:21:08.508
Are you gonna work out
or are you gonna fight?

01:21:08.536 --> 01:21:10.413
I guess we'll find out.

01:21:58.186 --> 01:22:00.666
No pain, no gain.

01:22:18.206 --> 01:22:20.015
That's it. I've got it.

01:22:20.041 --> 01:22:23.318
You traitor.

01:22:23.344 --> 01:22:25.017
Kill the bitch.
Let's bounce.

01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:30.752
Cross!

01:22:30.785 --> 01:22:33.197
Cover.
Give me that.

01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:37.936
Isn't that the tactical genius?

01:22:39.561 --> 01:22:41.905
I got you outmanned
and outgunned two to one.

01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:44.035
I guess you're
not so clever after all.

01:22:44.065 --> 01:22:46.477
It ain't the amount.
It's the skill.

01:22:46.501 --> 01:22:48.879
The skill the guy's got-
that's what it is.

01:22:48.903 --> 01:22:50.905
Save it for your girlfriend.

01:22:50.939 --> 01:22:52.612
Want to hear
something funny, though?

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.881
All right.

01:22:54.909 --> 01:22:56.911
See my smiling face?

01:22:56.945 --> 01:22:59.892
It's the last thing you're gonna see
before you hit your grave.

01:23:08.723 --> 01:23:11.761
Where are you going?
What are you gonna do?

01:23:11.793 --> 01:23:13.534
Drop your fucking weapons!

01:23:13.561 --> 01:23:16.565
Put them down now! Put them down!
Drop your weapons now!

01:23:16.598 --> 01:23:18.305
You motherfucker, drop it!

01:23:18.333 --> 01:23:21.143
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

01:23:40.822 --> 01:23:42.460
Cover me.

01:23:45.894 --> 01:23:47.737
I'm out.

01:23:47.762 --> 01:23:49.173
Cover him!

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.462
You're dead, bitch.

01:25:04.339 --> 01:25:06.945
Keep them pinned down.
I'm gonna flank them.

01:25:06.975 --> 01:25:08.648
I'll catch you long.
Go, go, go.

01:25:28.763 --> 01:25:30.174
Motherfucker!

01:27:26.547 --> 01:27:28.857
I got four of them.
How about you?

01:27:28.883 --> 01:27:31.363
I got some myself.

01:27:33.688 --> 01:27:35.463
Look at this sorry-ass bitch.

01:27:38.126 --> 01:27:39.628
Okay.

01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:41.571
Yeah, we made it.

01:27:46.334 --> 01:27:49.872
God damn, which one of you
motherfuckers killed my future ex-wife?

01:27:52.473 --> 01:27:53.918
Cross.

01:27:56.511 --> 01:27:58.513
You're out of ammo.

01:27:58.546 --> 01:28:00.548
So am I.

01:28:02.216 --> 01:28:04.594
Why don't we talk?

01:28:11.626 --> 01:28:14.163
We've got a lot in common,
you and I...

01:28:14.195 --> 01:28:16.971
Special Forces,

01:28:16.998 --> 01:28:19.239
black ops, CIA.

01:28:19.267 --> 01:28:20.803
No, I'm not Special Forces.

01:28:20.835 --> 01:28:23.179
I was never Special Forces.
I was a Marine.

01:28:23.204 --> 01:28:25.150
Whatever.

01:28:25.173 --> 01:28:27.744
What the hell are we trying
to kill each other for, huh?

01:28:27.775 --> 01:28:31.313
This isn't about patriotism

01:28:31.345 --> 01:28:34.588
with a flag.
This is about money.

01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:38.523
You know who
Samantha's contact was?

01:28:38.553 --> 01:28:40.362
It was a money guy.

01:28:40.388 --> 01:28:42.800
He delivered secret government funds
to favored efforts

01:28:42.824 --> 01:28:45.100
in trouble spots
around the world.

01:28:45.126 --> 01:28:48.039
He was a bag man for the CIA

01:28:48.062 --> 01:28:50.064
delivering bribes and payoffs.

01:28:50.097 --> 01:28:52.703
And that chip that was
implanted in her...

01:28:52.733 --> 01:28:55.077
Yeah?

01:28:55.102 --> 01:28:58.549
That contained secret
financial information.

01:28:58.573 --> 01:29:00.985
With that, we could access

01:29:01.008 --> 01:29:04.353
at least $200 million
of whitewashed money.

01:29:04.378 --> 01:29:06.790
clean money.

01:29:06.814 --> 01:29:08.691
You know what you could do
with that?

01:29:09.851 --> 01:29:13.264
You could open yourself
a free clinic in Mogadishu

01:29:13.287 --> 01:29:15.563
or an orphanage in Mexico

01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:17.661
or a bordello in Berlin.

01:29:17.692 --> 01:29:19.603
whatever the fuck you want.

01:29:19.627 --> 01:29:21.038
Right?

01:29:21.062 --> 01:29:22.234
Yeah.

01:29:22.263 --> 01:29:24.265
You and I both know

01:29:24.298 --> 01:29:26.778
this isn't about good guys
and bad guys anymore.

01:29:26.801 --> 01:29:29.805
We split that money
right down the middle.

01:29:29.837 --> 01:29:33.785
You walk away a rich guy.
I walk away a rich guy.

01:29:33.808 --> 01:29:36.789
Maybe you really would
give me $100 million.

01:29:43.951 --> 01:29:46.591
There's your act of good faith.

01:29:46.621 --> 01:29:49.500
You know, I'm just thinking
to myself

01:29:49.523 --> 01:29:53.061
that somewhere

01:29:53.094 --> 01:29:55.506
in the back of my mind,

01:29:55.529 --> 01:29:57.839
I kind of feel like

01:29:57.865 --> 01:30:01.642
you're not being
completely sincere.

01:30:08.843 --> 01:30:10.948
What, you don't trust me?

01:30:10.978 --> 01:30:12.924
Not exactly.

01:31:02.897 --> 01:31:05.241
Look at you, man.

01:31:05.266 --> 01:31:07.507
You're dead.

01:31:08.536 --> 01:31:11.847
Money can't buy life.
Money can't buy honor.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.077
You ain't got shit.

01:31:16.477 --> 01:31:19.117
I don't know what's wrong
with you, man.

01:31:20.781 --> 01:31:22.783
Now you're dead.

01:31:23.918 --> 01:31:26.455
Argh! Jeez.

01:31:28.122 --> 01:31:30.398
You talk about being a warrior.

01:31:30.424 --> 01:31:33.405
How does a warrior
break his word of honor?

01:31:35.096 --> 01:31:38.407
You know the story about
the scorpion and the frog?

01:31:38.432 --> 01:31:40.036
Yeah.
Well, that's me.

01:31:40.067 --> 01:31:41.808
I'm the fucking bad guy.

01:31:41.836 --> 01:31:43.338
Yeah? Well, I'm the good guy.

01:32:08.562 --> 01:32:10.906
Hi.

01:32:10.931 --> 01:32:13.138
You all right?

01:32:40.461 --> 01:32:43.806
Make sure that's set right.
Got a long trip.

01:32:46.333 --> 01:32:49.143
Well, I need a minute
with you, brother.

01:32:49.170 --> 01:32:51.172
Yeah, I got a minute.
What you got?

01:32:51.205 --> 01:32:53.651
You know, this whole thing
was about money.

01:32:53.674 --> 01:32:55.676
$200 million.

01:32:55.709 --> 01:32:59.350
I got the bank accounts
with all the numbers right here.

01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:02.554
It's all black ops money,

01:33:02.583 --> 01:33:04.927
all off the books.

01:33:04.952 --> 01:33:07.262
Ain't nobody to give it back to.

01:33:07.288 --> 01:33:09.290
I'm giving you half.

01:33:10.825 --> 01:33:12.702
What do you want to do
with it, man?

01:33:12.726 --> 01:33:16.173
Shit, probably use half of it
for some paybacks.

01:33:16.197 --> 01:33:19.178
Yeah, I'd like that myself.

01:33:20.468 --> 01:33:24.006
Maybe use the other half
to start up a security company,

01:33:24.038 --> 01:33:26.484
buy some toys.

01:33:26.507 --> 01:33:28.180
What the hell are you gonna do?

01:33:28.209 --> 01:33:32.021
I think I'll give half
to St. Jude's in Memphis.

01:33:32.046 --> 01:33:34.424
The other half I'll use
to have some fun,

01:33:34.448 --> 01:33:37.224
help some of my friends
and my family.

01:33:38.452 --> 01:33:41.023
Listen, in about 43 hours, man,

01:33:41.055 --> 01:33:42.728
after you finish your thing,

01:33:42.756 --> 01:33:44.793
I was hoping you could meet me
in Port D'Azul.

01:33:44.825 --> 01:33:46.361
You know that place, don't you?

01:33:46.393 --> 01:33:49.169
Yeah, I know the place.

01:33:49.196 --> 01:33:51.574
It's where we used to do
the mission debriefs.

01:33:51.599 --> 01:33:54.273
What the hell are you
cooking up now?

01:33:54.301 --> 01:33:56.907
I got another operation for us.

01:33:56.937 --> 01:33:59.008
I think you're gonna like it.

01:33:59.039 --> 01:34:01.041
Remember, man,

01:34:01.075 --> 01:34:04.079
it ain't over till we're dead.

01:34:08.883 --> 01:34:11.864
I hope you like to fly, baby,
'cause it's time to go.
