WEBVTT

00:04.504 --> 00:06.529
So Whatley's still Jewish, huh?

00:06.705 --> 00:09.573
Sure, without the parents,
it's a breeze.

00:09.743 --> 00:13.042
-Hey, Happy Hanukkah.
-Hey, Tim. Great party.

00:13.213 --> 00:15.010
Yeah.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.883
Hey, George, thanks again
for getting me those Yankee tickets.

00:19.052 --> 00:21.043
Oh, you're still in good
with the ground crew.

00:21.221 --> 00:23.280
That's good.
Look, I'd better circulate.

00:23.456 --> 00:25.390
Happy Hanukkah, Tiffany.

00:25.558 --> 00:28.959
This place is like Studio 54
with a menorah.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.427
I'm gonna get more of these
kosher cocktail franks.

00:32.665 --> 00:36.795
Oh, I got Denim Vest
checking me out.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.133
Fake phone number's
coming out tonight.

00:39.305 --> 00:40.863
Oh, you have a standard fake?

00:41.541 --> 00:44.374
Spell's out "No Elaine."

00:44.911 --> 00:47.971
-Isn't that eight letters?
-The extra E is for....

00:50.083 --> 00:51.710
That's neat.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.578
No, please. Denim Vest.

00:54.754 --> 00:57.780
He's smoothing it. Jerry. God.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.481
Hi.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.756
-Hi, I'm Jerry.
-Hi.

01:01.928 --> 01:05.728
You might not know it to look at me,
but I can run really, really fast.

01:07.734 --> 01:12.262
Nice vest.
I like the big metal buttons.

01:12.439 --> 01:16.739
They're snaps. Listen, maybe
we should go out sometime?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.708
Why don't I give you
my phone number?

01:23.650 --> 01:24.947
How did it go with that girl?

01:25.118 --> 01:27.109
Great, I'm going out with her
tomorrow night.

01:27.287 --> 01:30.256
-How did it go with the franks?
-Great. Ate the entire platter.

01:30.423 --> 01:33.290
-Had to call in sick today.
-Didn't you call in sick yesterday?

01:33.460 --> 01:35.394
Hey, I work for
Kruger Industrial Smoothing.

01:35.562 --> 01:38.656
-We don't care and it shows.
-You gotta open your mail here?

01:38.832 --> 01:41.266
Hey, at least I'm bringing
something to this.

01:41.434 --> 01:44.426
"Have you seen me?" Nope.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.094
There's something from Whatley.

01:46.272 --> 01:50.436
See? You give and you get.
This is what I'm trying to teach you.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.875
This holiday season a donation
has been made in your name...

01:54.047 --> 01:56.481
-...to the Children's Alliance?
-Oh, that's nice.

01:56.649 --> 02:00.050
I got him Yankee tickets. He's saying,
"I gave your gift to someone else."

02:00.220 --> 02:03.053
-To a children's charity.
-Don't you see how wrong that is?

02:03.223 --> 02:06.283
Where's your Christmas spirit?
An eye for an eye.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.451
Do me a favor, don't give me
anything this year.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.824
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.226
Oh, nothing for me.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.460
-I'm going to Atomic Sub later.
-Why are you eating there?

02:17.637 --> 02:20.504
I got a card and they stamp it
every time I buy a sub.

02:20.673 --> 02:24.165
Twenty-four stamps
and I become a submarine captain.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.039
What does that mean?

02:26.212 --> 02:27.839
Free sub.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.853
-What?
-Nothing. It's a card from my dad.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.580
-What is it?
-Elaine.

02:37.557 --> 02:40.924
Dear son, Happy Festivus.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.153
-What is Festivus?
-It's nothing. Stop it.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.762
-When George was growing--
-No.

02:44.931 --> 02:48.423
His father hated all the commercial
religious aspects of Christmas.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.125
-Yeah?
-He made up his own holiday.

02:50.303 --> 02:53.761
Oh, and another piece of the puzzle
falls into place.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.738
-All right.
-And instead of a tree...

02:56.910 --> 02:58.901
...didn't your father
put up an aluminum pole?

02:59.078 --> 03:01.205
-Stop it.
-Weren't there feats of strength...

03:01.381 --> 03:02.848
...that ended up with you crying?

03:03.016 --> 03:06.611
I can't take it anymore.
I'm going to work. You happy now?

03:09.255 --> 03:10.347
Hey, neighbor.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.718
Are you reading my VCR manual?

03:12.892 --> 03:16.521
Well, we can't all be reading the
classics, Professor High Brow.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.962
Oh, I can't believe it.
I've lost my Atomic Sub card.

03:21.134 --> 03:25.036
Oh, no. I bet I wrote
that fake number on the back of it...

03:25.205 --> 03:27.469
-...when I gave it to Denim Vest.
-So?

03:27.640 --> 03:30.507
I've eaten 23 bad subs.
I just need one more.

03:30.677 --> 03:33.646
It's like a long bad movie,
but you wanna see the end of it.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.212
-No, you walk out.
-All right.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.145
Then it's like a boring book.
You gotta finish it.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.286
No, you wait for the movie.

03:41.454 --> 03:44.321
I want that free sub.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.424
You don't need the card.

03:46.593 --> 03:49.619
High-end hoagie outfit like that.
It's all computerized.

03:49.796 --> 03:52.458
Technology.
They're cloning sheep now.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.999
No, no, no. They're not cloning sheep.
It's the same sheep.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.696
I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick
with two goats and a handkerchief...

03:59.872 --> 04:02.170
...on the old <i>Dean Martin Show</i>.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.340
Now I gotta get ahold
of Denim Vest.

04:05.511 --> 04:08.605
Why don't you try your blow off
number, see if he's called it?

04:08.781 --> 04:10.681
That's a good idea.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.315
Yeah, go.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.117
What?

04:19.659 --> 04:20.921
Really?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.925
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Bye.

04:23.096 --> 04:27.692
Great news. Yeah, the strike's
been settled. I'm going back to work.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.596
-What strike?
-H & H Bagels.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.827
That's where I worked.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.198
-You?
-Worked?

04:32.372 --> 04:33.771
-Bagels?
-Yeah, look, see?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.464
I still have my business card.

04:35.642 --> 04:38.110
Yeah, we've been on strike
for 12 years.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.769
Hey, I remember seeing
those guys picketing out there.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.710
But I haven't seen them in a long time.

04:42.882 --> 04:44.873
H & H wouldn't let us
use their bathroom...

04:45.051 --> 04:46.348
...while we were picketing.

04:46.519 --> 04:49.511
They were cramping our solidarity.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.717
What were your demands?

04:52.892 --> 04:55.986
Yeah, five thirty-five an hour,
and that's what they're paying now.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.528
I believe that's the new
minimum wage.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.632
And now you know
who to thank for that.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.793
-All right, I gotta go.
-Why didn't you ever mention this?

05:04.971 --> 05:07.496
Well, Jerry, I didn't want you to know
I was out of work.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.198
It's embarrassing.

05:13.046 --> 05:16.106
All right, everybody, I'm back.

05:17.884 --> 05:21.342
-Who are you?
-Cosmo Kramer. Strike's over.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.751
Oh, yeah, Kramer.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.652
Didn't any of the other guys
come back?

05:25.825 --> 05:29.488
No. I'm sure they all got other jobs
like 10 years ago.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.823
What? Man.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.865
Well, it kind of makes you wonder
what it was all for.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.934
I could use someone for the holidays.

05:37.103 --> 05:40.266
All right. Toss me an apron.
Let's bagel.

05:43.643 --> 05:46.043
-What are those?
-Those are raisin bagels.

05:47.046 --> 05:49.514
I never thought I'd live to see that.

05:50.983 --> 05:54.783
So anyway, I've been giving out your
phone number as my standard fake.

05:54.954 --> 05:57.582
So you're Elaine Benes.

05:57.757 --> 06:00.521
We've been getting calls
for you for five years.

06:01.260 --> 06:04.593
So listen, when this guy calls, if you
could just give him my real number.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.562
Hey, Charlie, guess who's here?
Elaine Benes.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.703
Elaine Benes?

06:10.870 --> 06:12.701
Elaine Benes.

06:14.707 --> 06:18.074
You make a lot of man friends.
You know who's a man?

06:18.244 --> 06:21.873
Charlie here. He's a man.
You know who else? Me.

06:22.048 --> 06:25.142
-I'm a man.
-I'm a man.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.912
Oh, my.

06:28.087 --> 06:30.647
I'll have this Vest guy
call your real number.

06:30.823 --> 06:33.917
You just give it to me...

06:34.093 --> 06:35.754
...and that way I'll have it.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.997
My number?

06:41.167 --> 06:42.156
Okay.

06:43.703 --> 06:46.536
Well, here you go.

06:47.106 --> 06:52.772
And tell you what, put a sawbuck on
Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.

06:54.914 --> 06:55.903
Hey, Jerry.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.777
-Hey, Tim.
-What's up?

06:57.950 --> 07:00.248
I'm having dinner with a girl
I met at your party.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.783
Jerry. Hi.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.855
-Gwen?
-Yeah.

07:09.028 --> 07:11.656
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.355
Come on, our table's ready.

07:18.738 --> 07:21.798
So attractive one day,
not attractive the next.

07:21.974 --> 07:25.102
-Have you come across this?
-Yes, I am familiar with the syndrome.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.044
-She's a two-face.
-Like the Batman villain?

07:29.215 --> 07:31.877
If that helps you.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.451
If I ask her out again,
I don't know who's showing up.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.985
The good, the bad, or the ugly.

07:36.155 --> 07:37.952
-Clint Eastwood.
-Yeah.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.284
Hey, check this out.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.620
I gotta give Christmas presents
at Kruger...

07:41.794 --> 07:43.284
...so I'm pulling a Whatley.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.557
A donation has been made
in your name to the Human Fund.

07:46.732 --> 07:48.791
-What is that?
-Made it up.

07:49.902 --> 07:53.565
The Human Fund.
Money for people.

07:53.739 --> 07:54.865
What do you think?

07:55.441 --> 07:57.534
It has a certain
understated stupidity.

07:58.044 --> 08:00.308
<i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i>.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.742
Yeah.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.975
-Bagels on the house.
-Hey.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.052
-How was your first day?
-Oh, fantastic.

08:08.221 --> 08:11.156
It felt so good to get my hands
back in that dough.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.525
-Your hands were in the dough?
-No, I didn't make these bagels.

08:17.530 --> 08:20.795
Yeah, they're day-olds.
The homeless won't even touch them.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.561
We try to fool them
by putting a few fresh ones on top...

08:23.736 --> 08:26.500
...but they dig, they test.

08:27.773 --> 08:31.834
-All right. I'm out of here.
-Happy Festivus.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.672
-What's Festivus?
-When George was--

08:33.846 --> 08:35.006
-No.
-His father--

08:35.181 --> 08:36.307
Stop it. It's nothing.

08:36.482 --> 08:40.350
It's a stupid holiday
my father invented. It doesn't exist.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.715
Happy Festivus, Georgie.

08:44.357 --> 08:48.259
Frank invented a holiday?
He's so prolific.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.328
Kramer. Listen,
I got a little phone relay going.

08:51.497 --> 08:55.024
So if a guy calls H & H and he's
looking for me, you take a message.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.192
You're still trying
to get that free sub?

08:57.370 --> 09:02.364
Hey, I have spent a lot of time
and I have eaten a lot of crap...

09:02.542 --> 09:06.911
...to get to where I am today,
and I am not throwing it all away now.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.240
Is there a captain's hat
involved in this?

09:09.749 --> 09:11.239
Maybe.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.716
Kramer, I got your message.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.412
I haven't celebrated Festivus in years.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.388
-What is your interest?
-Well, just tell me everything.

09:21.627 --> 09:25.154
Many Christmases ago,
I went to buy a doll for my son.

09:25.331 --> 09:30.200
I reached for the last one they had,
but so did another man.

09:30.603 --> 09:34.835
As I rained blows upon him,
I realized there had to be another way.

09:35.007 --> 09:37.339
-What happened to the doll?
-It was destroyed.

09:37.510 --> 09:41.446
But out of that
a new holiday was born.

09:41.614 --> 09:44.606
A Festivus for the rest of us.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.615
That must have been
some kind of doll.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.350
She was.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.425
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.621
Oh, Sandy,
here is a little something for you.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.424
Thanks.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.766
Phil, loved those cigars. Incoming.

10:07.039 --> 10:11.806
-Mr. Kruger, sir. Merry Christmas.
-Not if you could see our books.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.208
-What is this?
-The Human Fund.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.274
-Whatever.
-Exactly.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.781
Merry Christmas.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.785
And at the Festivus dinner you gather
your family around and tell them...

10:22.955 --> 10:26.652
...all the ways they have
disappointed you over the past year.

10:26.826 --> 10:29.454
-And is there a tree?
-No. Instead there's a pole.

10:29.629 --> 10:34.191
Requires no decoration.
I find tinsel distracting.

10:34.367 --> 10:38.303
Frank, this new holiday of yours,
it's scratching me right where I itch.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.768
-Let's do it then.
-All right.

10:39.939 --> 10:44.171
Festivus is back. I'll get the pole out
of the crawl space.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.038
-Hello, Frank.
-Hello, woman.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.579
Kramer. Kramer.
Any word from the Vest?

10:49.749 --> 10:50.841
No, no.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.315
Listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.

10:53.486 --> 10:57.217
Hey, I hired you to work during
the holidays. This is the holidays.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.324
-But it's Festivus.
-What?

10:59.859 --> 11:02.521
You're infringing on my right
to celebrate new holidays.

11:02.695 --> 11:04.993
-That's not a right.
-Well, it's going to be...

11:05.164 --> 11:07.428
...because I'm going back on strike.

11:07.933 --> 11:09.264
Yeah, it's a walkout.

11:09.435 --> 11:10.993
I gotta stay and wait for the call.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.535
You're siding with management?

11:12.705 --> 11:14.195
-No. I'm just--
-Scab.

11:14.373 --> 11:17.103
Scab. Scab.

11:18.277 --> 11:20.871
-Hey.
-Boy, am I glad to see you.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.675
-You were expecting someone else?
-You never know.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.079
You know, you might want
to take the tunnel.

11:26.252 --> 11:29.346
So, what do you feel like eating?
Chinese or Italian?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.789
I could go either way.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.388
You're telling me.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.568
So she was switching back and forth?

11:45.738 --> 11:46.727
The whole time.

11:46.906 --> 11:50.603
She was like a 3D baseball card
that changes depending on the angle.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.937
So one minute she's pretty
and at the plate...

11:53.112 --> 11:55.546
...and the next she's ugly
and advancing the runners.

11:56.782 --> 11:59.683
-So, what happened next?
-Well, we stopped by here...

11:59.852 --> 12:01.945
...and the only place
she always looked good...

12:02.121 --> 12:03.884
...was in that back booth over there.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.183
Just bring her here.
This is all you really need.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.826
I can't just keep bringing her
to the coffee shop.

12:08.994 --> 12:11.087
I mean, what if things,
you know, progress?

12:11.263 --> 12:12.821
Lights out.

12:13.966 --> 12:18.164
All right, I'll give it a shot.
I do really like this coffee shop.

12:19.271 --> 12:22.104
-Nice cuff links, by the way.
-Office Christmas gift.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.401
I tell you, this Human Fund
is a gold mine.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.511
That's not a French cuff shirt,
you know?

12:26.679 --> 12:29.079
I know, I cut the button off
and poked a hole.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.943
Oh, that's classy.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.249
Well, happy Festivus.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.652
What is that? Is that the pole?

12:38.824 --> 12:43.761
George, Festivus is your heritage.
It's part of who you are.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.487
That's why I hate it.

12:45.664 --> 12:49.100
There's a big dinner Tuesday night
at Frank's house. Everyone's invited.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.731
George...

12:52.905 --> 12:55.999
...you're forgetting how much
Festivus has meant to us all.

12:56.175 --> 12:59.008
I brought one of the cassette tapes.

12:59.178 --> 13:02.147
-<i>Read that poem.</i>
-<i>I can't read it. I need my glasses.</i>

13:02.314 --> 13:05.249
<i>You don't need glasses.
You're just weak. You're weak.</i>

13:05.417 --> 13:07.146
<i>Leave him alone.</i>

13:08.087 --> 13:13.992
<i>All right, George. It's time
for the Festivus feats of strength.</i>

13:14.160 --> 13:19.928
Oh, no. Turn it off. There's no
feats of strength. I hate Festivus.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.132
We had some good times.

13:22.902 --> 13:27.339
-Hey.
-Hi, there. This is Kramer and Frank.

13:27.506 --> 13:30.873
-Hi.
-Hello.

13:31.043 --> 13:34.171
-So you ready to go?
-Why don't we stay here?

13:34.346 --> 13:36.974
The back booth just opened up.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.482
Now, this is a good-looking booth.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.825
Get Festivus. Hey, no bagel,
no bagel, no bagel, no bagel.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.089
Hey, no bagel, no bagel,
no bagel....

13:53.265 --> 13:56.666
Lady, if you want a sandwich,
I'll make you a sandwich.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.168
I want the one that I earned.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.430
I'll get it. I'll get it.

14:02.608 --> 14:05.270
H & H and Elaine.
Elaine, you should get out of there.

14:05.444 --> 14:08.277
I sabotaged the bagel machine
last night. It's going down.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.972
-What did you do?
-You've been warned.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.543
Oh, hi.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.251
-Hey, the steam valve broke.
-Can we still make bagels?

14:18.424 --> 14:21.018
Sure. It's just a little steamy.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.857
How do you like your bagels now?

14:32.404 --> 14:34.372
George, I got something for you.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.030
I'm supposed to find a charity...

14:36.208 --> 14:38.369
...and throw some
of the company's money at it.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.638
They all seem the same to me,
so, what's the difference?

14:42.815 --> 14:46.307
-Twenty thousand dollars?
-Made out to the Human Fund.

14:47.152 --> 14:48.244
Gee.

14:49.255 --> 14:52.247
Oh, damn, I've locked myself
out of my office again.

14:53.792 --> 14:57.023
All right. I'm going home.

15:01.367 --> 15:05.303
Jerry, how many times
do we have to come to this place?

15:05.471 --> 15:06.938
Why? It's our place.

15:07.106 --> 15:09.404
I just found a rubber band
in my soup.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.634
Well, I know who's cooking today.

15:11.810 --> 15:15.803
-Hey, surprise, surprise.
-Hey, Georgie.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.814
I think I'm just gonna go.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.076
I'll be here.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.652
-Hey, soup.
-She didn't touch it.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.084
Paco.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.963
Hey, take a look at this.

15:36.368 --> 15:39.428
Twenty thousand dollars from Kruger?
You're not keeping this.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.540
-I don't know.
-Excuse me?

15:42.708 --> 15:44.699
I've been thinking,
this might be my chance...

15:44.877 --> 15:46.276
...to start giving back.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.879
You wanna give something back?
Start with the $20,000.

15:49.048 --> 15:52.449
-I'm serious.
-You're gonna start your own charity?

15:52.618 --> 15:55.781
I think I could be a philanthropist.
A kick-ass philanthropist.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.856
I would have all this money
and people would love me.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.117
Then, they would come to me
and beg.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.352
And if I felt like it,
I would help them out...

16:03.529 --> 16:05.360
...and then,
they would owe me big time.

16:06.732 --> 16:09.826
The first thing I'm gonna need
is a driver.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.368
No bagel, no bagel, no bagel,
no bagel, no bagel.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.904
Kramer, Vest just called.

16:15.074 --> 16:18.043
Yamahama, it's fright night.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.805
Oh, yeah. I got a little steam bath.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.417
Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have
my hands on that Atomic Sub card.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.051
And?

16:27.686 --> 16:29.153
Free sub.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.351
-I'll see you.
-Yeah.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.985
-Kramer. Hi.
-Oh, hello.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.187
It's Gwen.
We met at the coffee shop.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.564
I'm dating your friend, Jerry.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.930
Oh, I don't know
who you really are...

16:45.104 --> 16:48.164
...but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend
and she's not you.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.000
You're much better looking
and like a foot taller.

16:52.644 --> 16:55.977
That's why we're always hiding
in that coffee shop.

16:56.148 --> 16:59.584
-He's afraid of getting caught.
-Oh, he's a tomcat.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.449
Steve.

17:02.921 --> 17:05.252
-It's Elaine.
-From Tim Whatley's party?

17:05.424 --> 17:07.722
-Yeah.
-You look...

17:08.127 --> 17:09.252
...different.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.727
I see you're still sticking
with the denim.

17:12.431 --> 17:14.126
Do you have that card
that I gave you?

17:14.299 --> 17:17.132
Well, I had it back at my place...

17:17.301 --> 17:20.396
...but I can't go there now.
I'll give it to you later or something.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.540
No, no, no.
You give me your number.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.804
Okay. Sure.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.744
-Do you have the mumps?
-No.

17:28.914 --> 17:31.781
-Typhoid?
-No.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.918
Yamahama.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.789
A fake number. Blimey.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.728
George, we've got a problem.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.732
There's a memo here
from accounting...

17:49.902 --> 17:53.929
...telling me there's no such thing
as the Human Fund.

17:55.874 --> 17:57.899
Well, there could be.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.443
But there isn't.

18:01.246 --> 18:05.615
Well, I could--
I could give the money back. Here.

18:05.784 --> 18:07.581
George, I don't get it.

18:07.753 --> 18:11.917
If there's no Human Fund,
those donation cards were fake.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.850
You better have
a damn good reason...

18:15.027 --> 18:17.359
...why you gave me
a fake Christmas gift.

18:17.529 --> 18:22.694
Well, sir, I gave out
the fake card because...

18:23.502 --> 18:26.767
...I don't really celebrate Christmas.

18:27.739 --> 18:30.674
I celebrate Festivus.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.936
-Vemonus?
-Festivus, sir.

18:33.112 --> 18:38.015
And I was afraid that I would be
persecuted for my beliefs.

18:38.183 --> 18:40.777
They drove my family out
of Bayside, sir.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.547
-Are you making all this up too?
-Oh, no, sir.

18:43.722 --> 18:49.627
Festivus is all too real
and I could prove it...if I have to.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.695
Yeah, you probably should.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.398
-Happy Festivus.
-George. This is a surprise.

18:57.569 --> 19:01.471
-Who's the suit?
-Yo, Dad, this is my boss Mr. Kruger.

19:02.341 --> 19:05.139
-Have you seen the pole?
-No, he doesn't need to see the pole.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.107
He's gonna see it.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.641
Happy Festivus.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.250
Yamahama.

19:13.418 --> 19:15.852
I didn't have time to go home.
What are you doing here?

19:16.021 --> 19:18.819
-Embracing my roots.
-They nailed you on the 20 G's?

19:18.991 --> 19:20.982
Busted cold.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.324
It's made from aluminum.
Very high strength to weight ratio.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.660
I find your belief system fascinating.

19:30.068 --> 19:33.697
Hey, Happy Festivus, everyone.

19:33.872 --> 19:37.603
-Hello, again, Miss Benes.
-What are you doing here?

19:37.776 --> 19:40.973
Damnedest thing. Me and Charlie
were calling to ask you out...

19:41.146 --> 19:43.205
...and we got this bagel place.

19:43.382 --> 19:48.285
I told them I was just about to see you.
It's a Festivus miracle.

19:48.453 --> 19:51.684
-Dinner's ready.
-Let's begin.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.854
Dr. Van Nostrand.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.554
Oh, that's right.

20:00.632 --> 20:03.192
Welcome, newcomers.

20:03.969 --> 20:08.736
The tradition of Festivus begins
with the airing of grievances.

20:08.907 --> 20:11.034
I got a lot of problems
with you people...

20:11.210 --> 20:13.940
...and now you're gonna
hear about it.

20:14.112 --> 20:15.875
Yo, Kruger.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.778
My son tells me your company stinks.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.612
Oh, God.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.451
Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.449
Kruger.

20:25.624 --> 20:30.926
You couldn't smooth a silk sheet
if you had a hot date with a babe--

20:32.798 --> 20:34.265
I lost my train of thought.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.528
-Jerry.
-Gwen?

20:40.706 --> 20:43.470
-How did you know I was here?
-Kramer told me.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.837
Another Festivus miracle.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.080
I guess this is the ugly girl
I've been hearing about.

20:52.484 --> 20:56.011
Hey, I was in a shvitz for six hours.
Give me a break.

20:57.422 --> 21:00.858
Gwen. Gwen, wait.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.957
Bad lighting on the porch.

21:04.129 --> 21:08.498
-Hey, how did my horse do?
-He had to be shot.

21:10.302 --> 21:14.204
And now as Festivus rolls on,
we come to the feats of strength.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.863
Not the feats of strength.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.771
This year the honor
goes to Mr. Kramer.

21:20.812 --> 21:22.677
Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.782
I have to work a double shift
at H & H.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.350
-I thought you were on strike.
-Yeah, well, I caved.

21:27.519 --> 21:29.453
I mean, I really had
to use their bathroom.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.647
Frank, no offense,
but this holiday's a little...

21:32.824 --> 21:33.848
...out there.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.357
Hey, Kramer, you can't go.

21:35.527 --> 21:37.290
Who's gonna do
the feats of strength?

21:37.462 --> 21:39.692
How about George?

21:40.532 --> 21:41.794
Good thinking, Cougar.

21:43.435 --> 21:47.132
Until you pin me, George,
Festivus is not over.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.366
Oh, please. Somebody stop this.

21:50.542 --> 21:53.238
Let's rumble.

21:53.412 --> 21:56.506
-I think you can take him, Georgie.
-Hey, come on. Be sensible.

21:56.682 --> 21:59.048
Stop crying and fight your father.

21:59.217 --> 22:03.278
-Oh, I give. I give.
-This is the best Festivus ever.
