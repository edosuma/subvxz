00:00.083 --> 00:02.125
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.208 --> 00:04.125
I saw the man in your freezer.

00:04.208 --> 00:07.166
<i>Mrs McCluskey and Parker</i>
<i>shared a secret...</i>

00:07.250 --> 00:08.792
You can never tell anyone.

00:08.875 --> 00:11.417
<i>...but the secret was discovered.</i>

00:11.500 --> 00:13.542
You bet me in a game of poker?

00:13.625 --> 00:16.208
<i>- Susan was forced to make a decision.</i>
- Get out.

00:16.291 --> 00:18.625
There will be no kissing
and there will be no wedding.

00:18.709 --> 00:21.333
<i>Lynette ventured</i>
<i>into dangerous territory.</i>

00:21.417 --> 00:23.792
- You ever wear your hair down?
- Sometimes.

00:23.875 --> 00:26.125
- It looks really good.
- Thanks.

00:26.208 --> 00:27.667
Are you embarrassed to be dating me?

00:27.750 --> 00:29.917
If Gabby finds out
she's going to hit the ceiling.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.417
<i>Edie came to a disturbing realisation...</i>

00:32.500 --> 00:34.625
Oh, my God.
You're still in love with her.

00:34.709 --> 00:37.458
<i>...and Gabby took a bold step.</i>

00:37.542 --> 00:41.333
<i>In a few months,</i>
<i>I will be Mrs Victor Lang.</i>

00:42.208 --> 00:45.166
Really, this is so stupid.
I don't know my own strength.

00:45.250 --> 00:50.417
<i>The night of her engagement party,</i>
<i>Gabrielle Solis was injured.</i>

00:50.500 --> 00:52.333
<i>But she wasn't hurt by the chauffeur</i>

00:52.417 --> 00:55.458
<i>who almost slammed a door</i>
<i>on her fingers,</i>

00:55.542 --> 00:58.709
<i>or the stranger</i>
<i>who almost stepped on her hand,</i>

00:58.792 --> 01:03.542
<i>or the waiter who almost dropped</i>
<i>a knife on her wrist.</i>

01:03.625 --> 01:06.166
<i>No, Gabrielle's injury came about</i>

01:06.250 --> 01:09.583
<i>in a more unexpected fashion</i>

01:09.667 --> 01:13.917
<i>and was caused by someone</i>
<i>Gabrielle thought was her friend.</i>

01:14.875 --> 01:16.125
Thank you.

01:16.208 --> 01:17.959
So have you told Bree
about your engagement?

01:18.041 --> 01:20.000
Yep. She's on the top of a Swiss Alp

01:20.083 --> 01:22.625
and still managed
to send a basket of muffins.

01:22.709 --> 01:23.792
You're kidding.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.500
No, the damn things travelled
5,000 miles, and they were still moist.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.625
I don't know how she does it.

01:28.709 --> 01:30.542
Hey, it's getting late.
Let's break out the champagne.

01:30.625 --> 01:31.667
Wait, wait.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.667
You're not gonna embarrass me
with some sappy toast, are you?

01:33.750 --> 01:36.125
I'm not. But Susan's written a poem.

01:37.250 --> 01:38.458
A poem?

01:38.542 --> 01:42.542
She's reworked
the lyrics to <i>Wind Beneath My Wings.</i>

01:44.125 --> 01:47.542
<i>Testing. One, two, three. Testing.</i>

01:47.625 --> 01:50.041
What are you waiting for?
Get the champagne.

01:54.417 --> 01:55.500
Hi.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.583
- Hey, Gabby.
- Hi, Edie.

01:58.667 --> 02:01.709
So, I finally met Victor.
He is so charming.

02:01.792 --> 02:05.792
Isn't he great? I know it's been quick,
but he's just so amazing.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.542
So you really love him?

02:08.625 --> 02:11.875
- He is the one?
- He is.

02:11.959 --> 02:13.834
And I've never been happier.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.834
I am so thrilled for you.

02:19.917 --> 02:21.792
- Edie, are you okay?
- Yes.

02:21.959 --> 02:24.834
Oh, yes. Yes, I'm fine. I...

02:25.834 --> 02:28.041
Oh, sweetie.

02:28.125 --> 02:31.917
Don't worry, you're gonna find
someone soon. I just know it.

02:32.500 --> 02:37.083
- What?
- Actually, I have found someone.

02:37.250 --> 02:42.041
- And I am crazy about him.
- Well, who is it?

02:42.125 --> 02:46.291
Oh, no. No, no. Tonight is about you.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.583
Oh, no, no, Edie! Come on.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.834
It would make me happy
to know who's making you happy.

02:53.208 --> 02:54.458
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.792
I wanna know who's putting
that dopey grin on your face.

02:57.875 --> 03:02.125
Well, actually, it's Carlos.

03:02.208 --> 03:03.291
Who?

03:03.375 --> 03:07.250
Carlos. I've been seeing Carlos.

03:13.333 --> 03:17.000
<i>And this is how Gabrielle Solis</i>
<i>came to be injured</i>

03:17.083 --> 03:19.291
<i>the night of her engagement party.</i>

03:19.375 --> 03:22.458
<i>And though she seemed to laugh it off,</i>

03:22.542 --> 03:26.542
<i>Gabrielle had been cut</i>
<i>much, much deeper</i>

03:26.625 --> 03:29.125
<i>than anyone could see.</i>

04:11.750 --> 04:14.500
- Greg is definitely off the wagon...
<i>- Gossip.</i>

04:14.583 --> 04:18.125
<i>For most housewives,</i>
<i>it's just a harmless form of recreation.</i>

04:18.208 --> 04:23.125
<i>An exchange of semi-interesting tidbits</i>
<i>concerning the semi-interesting lives</i>

04:23.208 --> 04:24.583
<i>of people they know.</i>

04:24.667 --> 04:27.709
That mailman was in Sarah's house
over an hour.

04:27.792 --> 04:30.625
Packages weren't all he's delivering.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.834
I could smell the whisky
on Amy's breath.

04:32.917 --> 04:34.417
It wasn't even noon yet.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.625
Joanne may say that she was
off on a religious retreat,

04:36.709 --> 04:39.792
but since when does praying
make your boobs bigger?

04:40.542 --> 04:42.834
<i>But the time comes</i>
<i>in every neighbourhood</i>

04:42.917 --> 04:45.750
<i>when something</i>
<i>very interesting happens.</i>

04:45.834 --> 04:51.125
<i>And that's when gossip stops being</i>
<i>recreation and becomes obsession.</i>

04:51.208 --> 04:53.375
What kind of woman would keep
her husband's body in the freezer?

04:53.458 --> 04:56.333
For 10 years? It's crazy.
Has anybody talked to her?

04:56.542 --> 04:58.750
I've knocked twice.
She's not answering.

04:58.834 --> 05:00.667
Oh, I saw the curtain move.
I think I saw a hand.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.542
Great. Now we know she's watching us.

05:02.625 --> 05:03.709
Why should we be embarrassed?

05:03.792 --> 05:05.917
We're not the ones
who kept a corpsicle in the basement.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.083
That's right. She babysat your kids.

05:08.166 --> 05:10.000
Oh, please, I don't want to think
of how many times

05:10.083 --> 05:12.083
she brought them ice cream
from that basement.

05:12.166 --> 05:14.583
I mean, jeez, if you want to keep
your husband on ice,

05:14.667 --> 05:17.041
at least have a dedicated freezer.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.583
Do you think she actually killed him?

05:18.667 --> 05:21.000
Yeah, why else would
she have hid the body?

05:21.083 --> 05:24.333
Well, so far she's only been charged
with improper disposal of a corpse.

05:24.417 --> 05:26.959
But once they defrost the body
and do an autopsy,

05:27.041 --> 05:30.041
I guarantee you they're gonna find
a bellyful of arsenic.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.667
What's arsenic?

05:32.834 --> 05:34.792
It's just... It's something yucky, honey.

05:34.875 --> 05:38.125
Go on and play with your ball. Go on.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.291
We're trying so hard
to protect them from this.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.667
There are just some things
that kids don't need to know about.

05:44.750 --> 05:47.417
Hell, there's some things
we don't need to know about.

05:52.542 --> 05:54.417
Would you guys excuse me?

05:57.959 --> 05:59.542
Hey, Edie.

05:59.625 --> 06:03.250
Oh, hi, Gabby. What's up?

06:03.333 --> 06:07.667
I've been doing some thinking,
and you know how...

06:07.750 --> 06:09.792
How do I put this?

06:09.875 --> 06:12.792
You know how you feel like
sometimes people hate you?

06:13.458 --> 06:17.250
- I don't feel like that.
- Well, you should, 'cause they do.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.500
Since when?

06:18.583 --> 06:20.583
Since you started doing things
to piss people off.

06:20.667 --> 06:21.917
About what?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.166
I don't know. Off the top of my head,

06:25.250 --> 06:27.041
dating your friends' exes.

06:27.125 --> 06:32.542
Oh, so that big smile on your face
the other night was all an act.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.875
You're not fine with me seeing Carlos.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.041
Edie, there are a thousand single men
in Fairview.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.083
Why do you have
to date my ex-husband?

06:39.166 --> 06:41.375
You're engaged to somebody else.
What do you care?

06:41.458 --> 06:42.542
It's awkward.

06:42.625 --> 06:45.000
It's like if I donated a dress to charity,

06:45.083 --> 06:47.542
and I went to a party
and you showed up wearing it.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.333
Again, if you gave it away
in the first place,

06:49.417 --> 06:51.083
then what the hell
are you bitching about?

06:51.166 --> 06:52.959
Look, Edie, just find your own men

06:53.041 --> 06:56.875
and stop snapping up
other people's cast-offs!

06:57.792 --> 06:59.959
And what if I don't?

07:04.834 --> 07:08.041
Then be prepared
to suffer the consequences.

07:08.125 --> 07:10.166
Oh, please.

07:10.250 --> 07:14.125
You are as tall as my legs.
What are you gonna do?

07:14.709 --> 07:16.709
You're about to find out.

07:23.083 --> 07:24.583
Who is it this time?

07:26.583 --> 07:28.417
It's Ian.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.834
- You gonna talk to him?
- No.

07:31.834 --> 07:33.500
He's got flowers.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.083
- I don't care!
- Looks like it's two dozen roses.

07:36.166 --> 07:38.750
Oh, good.
I hope the thorns rip him to shreds.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.500
Okay, Mom, I know what Mike
and Ian did was wrong...

07:41.583 --> 07:43.959
They bet me in a game of poker!

07:44.041 --> 07:47.000
They made decisions about my life
over a hand of five-card stud!

07:47.083 --> 07:49.709
"Wrong" does not even begin
to cover it.

07:51.208 --> 07:54.000
Okay, but there are only two guys
in this world

07:54.083 --> 07:56.458
who know all of your flaws
and have still found a way to love you.

07:56.542 --> 07:57.667
You're just gonna toss them both
away?

07:57.750 --> 07:59.625
Yes. I don't need a man.

07:59.709 --> 08:02.959
I don't even need sex.
I went without it the first 16 years...

08:04.625 --> 08:07.667
Twenty-two years of my life,
and I can go a few more.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.792
- This should be interesting.
- What?

08:17.458 --> 08:19.583
Mike just walked up.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.792
Give it up.

08:25.291 --> 08:28.583
She didn't answer the first 10 times,
she's not gonna answer it now.

08:33.750 --> 08:38.250
This is getting sad.
Take it like a Brit. Stiff upper lip.

08:38.333 --> 08:41.208
You know what?
I've just about bloody had it with you!

08:41.291 --> 08:44.583
I preferred you when you were
comatose and pooping in a bag!

08:44.667 --> 08:47.792
Lucky for you
I don't have that bag right now.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.417
All right, that does it.

08:52.750 --> 08:54.458
Excuse me! Guys...

08:54.542 --> 08:57.959
Hi. My mom would really like
for both of you to leave.

08:58.041 --> 09:00.917
Don't soft-pedal it.
Let them know I mean business.

09:00.959 --> 09:04.458
Because if you don't,
she'll be very, very disappointed.

09:04.542 --> 09:06.125
Rip 'em!

09:06.458 --> 09:09.834
So just go home
and think about what you've done.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.834
You want something bitchier,
do it yourself!

09:20.208 --> 09:21.291
Here we are.

09:21.375 --> 09:25.083
Ravioli stuffed with duck confit
in a porcini cream sauce.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.166
What do you think?

09:31.500 --> 09:34.333
I think it's a shame
you didn't make any for yourself.

09:40.417 --> 09:42.208
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

09:42.291 --> 09:46.208
- I just wanted to say I love you.
- Aren't you sweet.

09:47.166 --> 09:49.375
What's that noise in the background?
Are the boys still up?

09:49.458 --> 09:52.166
Yeah, they don't want to go to bed.

09:52.250 --> 09:55.333
Well, of course they don't. They're
kids, you're the dad. Make them.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.500
I tried, honey.
But they wanna wait up for you.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.041
They... They miss their mom.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.083
Is this your way of guilting me
into coming back home?

10:04.166 --> 10:07.709
Lynette, the restaurant did close
a half hour ago.

10:07.792 --> 10:10.208
<i>Preston! Don't throw pudding!</i>

10:12.291 --> 10:15.750
Tom, I'm sorry, I can't come home.

10:15.834 --> 10:20.834
We're doing inventory,
so it could be a while.

10:21.834 --> 10:25.417
Well, okay. Try to hurry.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.542
I will. I love you. Bye.

10:30.125 --> 10:33.875
- Inventory?
- I know. I'm a horrible person.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.166
I just chose ravioli over motherhood.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.375
I should... I should go home.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.250
Lynette, you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

10:42.333 --> 10:45.375
You bust your ass in this restaurant
every day to keep it going.

10:45.458 --> 10:48.166
If anybody deserves a little downtime,
it's you.

10:48.250 --> 10:52.041
Those are shameless rationalisations.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.792
Keep them coming.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.625
Those, too.

11:05.542 --> 11:09.500
There you are.
What are you doing outside?

11:10.458 --> 11:13.250
Some big kids threw eggs
at Mrs McCluskey's house.

11:14.792 --> 11:18.542
Jeez, they shouldn't have done that.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.709
We should go talk to her.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.583
No, it's late.

11:25.667 --> 11:28.417
She probably doesn't want us
to bother her.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.917
Come on, bud, bedtime.

11:46.125 --> 11:49.959
So here's what's gonna happen.
We're not talking to Edie any more.

11:50.041 --> 11:52.959
- What do you mean, "We"?
- I mean, "We", as in, she betrayed me,

11:53.083 --> 11:54.166
and you're my best friends,

11:54.250 --> 11:56.250
so you're gonna support me
because that's what friends do.

11:56.333 --> 12:00.417
And support to you means
acting like we're in junior high?

12:00.500 --> 12:02.750
I can't believe you'
re not furious at this.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.667
Before she sank her fangs into Carlos,

12:04.750 --> 12:07.083
she was dating your ex-husband
and Mike!

12:07.166 --> 12:11.125
Yes. And do you know who I blame?
I blame Karl and Mike.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.667
Why isn't anybody mad at them?
I mean, let's face it.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.417
The men, they get away with murder.
They're scum!

12:18.667 --> 12:20.500
Okay, back to Edie.

12:20.583 --> 12:23.000
I'm not sure
I'm comfortable ganging up on her.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.959
Really? Because I wasn't
very comfortable taking your side

12:26.041 --> 12:28.959
when you were feuding with Patty
Monroe over the backyard fence line.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.083
But I did.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.250
Oh, Gabby, that's not fair.
Nobody really liked Patty to begin with.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.000
Don't even get me started
about what I've done for you.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.208
I'm still boycotting
Madame Kim's Day Spa

12:38.291 --> 12:40.000
because of your botched bikini wax.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.458
Oh, my God.
How do you botch a bikini wax?

12:42.542 --> 12:44.250
She will show you later!

12:44.333 --> 12:49.000
The point is, good friends share
more than just gossip and brunch.

12:49.083 --> 12:52.166
They share enemies, too.
So are you with me or not?

12:56.792 --> 13:00.417
- Of course we're with you.
- We will give Edie the cold shoulder.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.750
No, no. Not cold. Frozen.

13:02.834 --> 13:05.458
I want icicles hanging
from that bitch's ears!

13:09.959 --> 13:11.333
Hello?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.166
Hi.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.458
Hey, do you still want me to look
at that book report?

13:17.542 --> 13:20.041
Daddy helped me yesterday.
You weren't home.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.041
Okay.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.583
Daddy does everything lately.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.583
How come you always come home
so late?

13:29.792 --> 13:32.250
Well, I'm really busy at the restaurant.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.750
Believe me, I come home to Daddy
just as soon as I can.

13:37.375 --> 13:38.583
You're lying.

13:40.709 --> 13:41.875
What?

13:41.959 --> 13:44.875
You always laugh like that
when you're telling a lie.

13:48.709 --> 13:51.291
Why would you say that?

13:51.375 --> 13:53.417
Because it's true.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.000
I stay late
because there's a lot of work to do.

13:57.083 --> 13:58.834
And right now,
I'm the only person who can do it.

13:58.917 --> 14:00.625
And now,
I have to go to the grocery store

14:00.709 --> 14:02.959
because I am the only person
who can do that.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.959
So why don't you go upstairs
and finish your homework?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.625
Okay.

14:14.291 --> 14:16.125
But it is what you do.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.125
Excuse me!

14:36.458 --> 14:38.583
Hey! Excuse me.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.083
That's my space.

14:40.166 --> 14:42.709
Well, I'm parked in it,
so that kind of makes it my space.

14:43.625 --> 14:45.667
Hey, I waited for that spot

14:45.750 --> 14:48.583
while the guy made three phone calls
and flossed his teeth.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.917
- You can't just steal it.
- It's a parking space.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.291
Keep a lid on your hormones, honey.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.083
God! You did that on purpose!

14:59.166 --> 15:01.542
Yeah, and I'm about
to do this on purpose, too!

15:01.625 --> 15:04.625
You crazy bitch!
What do you think you're doing?

15:04.709 --> 15:06.166
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

15:06.250 --> 15:07.959
I'm taking my damn space!

15:08.041 --> 15:09.750
Get out of my car! Get out of my car!

15:09.834 --> 15:12.625
- Whoa. Hey!
- Say you're sorry!

15:12.709 --> 15:14.625
- Let me go!
- Say it!

15:14.709 --> 15:17.667
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry!
- Say, "I am a rude, arrogant bastard

15:17.750 --> 15:20.000
"who needs to treat women
with courtesy and respect."

15:20.083 --> 15:23.000
"I'm a rude, arrogant..."
How does the rest of it go?

15:23.083 --> 15:25.417
Freeze!

15:25.542 --> 15:28.458
- Was this man trying to steal your car?
- It's my car!

15:28.583 --> 15:31.208
She tripped me and grabbed my keys.

15:32.542 --> 15:36.166
- Is this true, ma'am?
- Oh, all right. Take his side.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.917
- Hey, who you spying on?
- Lynette.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.166
She hasn't returned
my last two phone calls.

15:48.250 --> 15:49.583
I think something's up.

15:49.667 --> 15:53.000
- She's probably just busy.
- Yeah. We'll see about that.

15:53.083 --> 15:56.041
I'm calling her right now.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.875
- Oh, my God.
- What?

16:05.000 --> 16:08.083
She just screened me.
I have been screened!

16:08.166 --> 16:09.875
Maybe she's in a hurry.

16:10.583 --> 16:13.834
No, no, no. This has Gabrielle Solis
written all over it.

16:13.917 --> 16:17.750
- She is turning people against me.
- And you're surprised?

16:17.834 --> 16:21.417
I told you how she'd react
if she found out about us.

16:21.500 --> 16:25.542
Yeah? Well, if she wants to play
these schoolgirl games, fine.

16:25.625 --> 16:28.250
Because I invented them.

16:36.625 --> 16:39.667
- Lynette! Hi!
- Hey, hey.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.333
- I just tried calling you.
- Really?

16:42.417 --> 16:45.834
- My ringer must have been off.
- No prob.

16:45.917 --> 16:49.458
I wanted to invite you and the boys
to Travers' birthday party on Saturday.

16:49.542 --> 16:53.250
I'm having this reptile guy and he's
got all these cool snakes and lizards.

16:53.333 --> 16:57.000
Oh, the boys would love that,
but unfortunately I gotta work.

16:57.083 --> 17:00.208
Well, that's a shame
because I was hoping you could cater.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.000
- Cater?
- Yeah.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.709
I'm gonna need pastas and salads
for the parents.

17:06.792 --> 17:10.417
- And at least 20 pizzas for the kids.
- Wow, that many?

17:10.500 --> 17:12.583
Yeah. Well, you know kids.

17:12.667 --> 17:16.041
If one has a pizza party,
they're all gonna want a pizza party.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.625
Could be good for business.

17:21.041 --> 17:24.500
Well, yeah,
I guess I could work something out.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.208
I knew I could count on you. Love ya.

17:35.417 --> 17:39.250
Look, whatever that court report says,
I do not have anger issues.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.291
I was just having a bad day.

17:41.375 --> 17:46.166
You threatened to decapitate a man
over a parking space.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.542
A very bad day.

17:48.625 --> 17:54.000
Susan, when someone loses it
like you did, there's usually a reason.

17:54.083 --> 17:57.417
- Are things going okay at work?
- Work is great.

17:57.500 --> 18:01.208
You could just sign that paper
and tell the judge I'm fine.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.750
- What about your family?
- Family's terrific.

18:03.834 --> 18:06.875
Seriously, you're just wasting
your time here.

18:06.959 --> 18:08.583
How's your love life?

18:20.000 --> 18:23.834
Cancel my lunch.
I'm gonna be here for a while.

18:28.417 --> 18:30.500
Will you stop ringing that damn...

18:31.500 --> 18:34.041
I'm sorry, Parker. I thought you
were one of those little pissants

18:34.125 --> 18:36.500
that keep ringing the bell
and running away.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.208
So what's on your mind?

18:38.291 --> 18:42.208
I want you to come back
and baby-sit us. The new sitter stinks.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.750
- Your folks hired a new sitter?
- Yeah.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.959
And she thinks
carrot sticks are snacks.

18:49.875 --> 18:54.500
Well, that's rough.
But life's like that sometimes.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.208
It doesn't have to be.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.583
If you just told people what happened
with your husband,

18:58.667 --> 19:00.834
everything could go back
to the way it was.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.750
Parker, see those women over there?

19:05.917 --> 19:09.250
Nothing I could say would stop
those tongues from wagging.

19:11.125 --> 19:16.000
I'm sorry, kid,
but I just have to wait this one out.

19:22.458 --> 19:23.750
Can you imagine?

19:23.834 --> 19:28.583
I mean, finding out that two men
you trusted bet you in a poker game.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.291
- I mean, how demeaning is that?
- It depends on how you look at it.

19:32.375 --> 19:36.083
Men have been waging contests
over women for centuries.

19:36.166 --> 19:40.166
I grant you, poker isn't as romantic as,
say, jousting,

19:40.250 --> 19:42.959
but it shows how they felt about you.

19:43.041 --> 19:46.875
The real question
is how did you feel about them?

19:47.542 --> 19:50.875
I told you. Hurt and betrayed...

19:50.959 --> 19:54.583
No. How did you feel about them
before this poker business?

19:56.458 --> 20:01.000
Well, I was engaged to Ian,

20:01.083 --> 20:04.500
so, obviously, I loved him.

20:04.583 --> 20:08.542
And Mike?
Were you in love with him, too?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.458
- How are we doing on time?
- Susan.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.667
Okay, fine. I loved him. I still love him.
And I love Ian.

20:14.750 --> 20:17.917
So I am totally, hopelessly
in love with two men.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.333
Now we're getting somewhere.
This is good.

20:20.417 --> 20:23.625
No, this is horrible!
This wasn't supposed to happen!

20:23.834 --> 20:27.583
I only let myself fall for Ian
because I thought Mike was lost to me.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.834
And then, bang,
suddenly he wants me back,

20:29.917 --> 20:32.959
and now I have this choice
that I can't possibly make.

20:33.041 --> 20:34.750
I agree it's tough.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.125
It's devastating.

20:37.458 --> 20:41.208
If I go with Mike,
Ian's heart will be broken,

20:41.291 --> 20:43.417
and Ian does not deserve that.

20:44.917 --> 20:48.333
But how can I reject Mike
after all he's been through?

20:48.417 --> 20:51.375
So you're just gonna walk away
from both of them?

20:52.083 --> 20:54.208
You have to make a choice, sweetie.

20:54.291 --> 20:58.333
You've got two great guys,
both of them crazy about you.

20:58.417 --> 21:01.917
To let one go, well, that's life.
It happens.

21:03.166 --> 21:06.375
To let them both go, that's just...

21:07.208 --> 21:08.583
Stupid?

21:09.834 --> 21:13.500
Yes. That would be the clinical term.

21:19.208 --> 21:21.583
Sounds great. Thanks.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.458
Hey, how would you like
to eat something

21:28.542 --> 21:30.625
that's neither pasta nor pizza?

21:30.709 --> 21:33.083
Such food exists? Don't tease me.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.959
No, my friend Al,
he's opening a soul food place,

21:36.041 --> 21:37.250
and Sunday night,

21:37.333 --> 21:39.750
he wants to test the menu
with some of his chef buddies.

21:39.834 --> 21:41.625
He said I could bring someone.

21:42.583 --> 21:46.458
- And you want me to go with you?
- It'll be after we close.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.834
And don't tell me
that you hate southern food,

21:50.917 --> 21:54.792
-'cause then we can't be friends.
- No. I love it.

21:54.875 --> 21:57.166
It's just, that's
a little late for me, and...

21:57.250 --> 22:00.083
Okay, I just thought it would be fun.

22:00.166 --> 22:03.458
No, it would be.
But Sunday nights are kind of crazy.

22:03.542 --> 22:05.667
I'm packing lunches
and checking homework...

22:05.750 --> 22:08.792
Right, right, right. No worries. I get it.

22:08.875 --> 22:11.500
You were just the first person
I thought of.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.542
You know, maybe I should go.

22:22.625 --> 22:25.750
It's part of the job to check out
the competition. Right?

22:25.834 --> 22:26.959
Yeah, absolutely.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.583
Never hurts to see what else
is out there.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.125
I agree.

22:52.333 --> 22:55.542
Hey guys, go check out the snakes.
I'll give you some pizza later, okay?

22:55.625 --> 22:57.458
- See you later.
- All right, I'll see you later.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.959
- Hey, you want some pizza?
- Yeah.

22:59.041 --> 23:00.792
There you go.

23:00.875 --> 23:04.000
Lynette, what are you doing here?

23:05.583 --> 23:06.750
Edie asked me to cater.

23:06.834 --> 23:10.542
I know, I'm a total whore,
but please don't rat me out to Gabby.

23:10.625 --> 23:14.083
Hi, Susan.
I have 30 copies of your book.

23:14.166 --> 23:18.041
The kids can't wait for you to sign it.
Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.

23:21.542 --> 23:23.834
Looks like we're working
the same corner.

23:23.917 --> 23:27.291
Yeah. Only I didn't know Edie
was gonna have the party in a park.

23:27.375 --> 23:30.208
- What if Gabby sees us?
- Trust me, we can both relax.

23:30.291 --> 23:33.625
I talked to her this morning,
and she's out with Victor all day.

23:34.417 --> 23:36.542
That's a relief.

23:59.750 --> 24:02.667
Go ahead. I dare you.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.458
What's going on?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.500
- There.
- Hey! Don't do that!

24:24.583 --> 24:26.709
- Why not?
- Because she's not a witch!

24:26.792 --> 24:29.250
- How do you know?
- Because she isn't! Don't be a jerk!

24:29.333 --> 24:31.834
What is she, your girlfriend?
Parker's in love!

24:31.917 --> 24:33.417
Shut up!

24:34.750 --> 24:37.458
Hey, you boys! Knock it off!

24:38.583 --> 24:41.792
Parker, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

24:42.875 --> 24:47.083
You know, everything would be okay
if you'd tell people what you told me.

24:47.166 --> 24:48.834
You can make them stop.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.375
Hey, Lynette, it's Gabby.

24:58.458 --> 25:01.333
Victor got pulled into some photo-op
at the homeless shelter.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.083
So I'm free for lunch.
You wanna go with?

25:04.166 --> 25:07.917
I tried Susan, but she's not home
which is weird,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.125
because her car's in the driveway.

25:11.417 --> 25:15.542
And so is yours. Where is everybody?

25:32.625 --> 25:34.834
- Here you go.
- Down! Down! Get down!

25:34.917 --> 25:36.834
- Lynette, what is wrong with you?
- Gabby's coming.

25:36.917 --> 25:38.917
What?
I thought you said she was with Victor!

25:39.000 --> 25:41.667
I was wrong. I was wrong!
Come on, follow me.

25:45.208 --> 25:48.208
- Mommy, can I play?
- No. Go ride the python.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.875
Come on!

25:59.250 --> 26:02.417
Okay, okay, she's circling the park.

26:03.291 --> 26:05.625
I wish she'd hurry.
I'm terrified of snakes.

26:05.709 --> 26:08.125
Yeah, I'm more terrified of Gabby.

26:08.208 --> 26:11.333
Okay, good, good,
we're almost home free.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.583
- What?
- Don't turn around.

26:26.041 --> 26:28.875
Lynette! Susan!

26:29.792 --> 26:31.792
Hey, Gab. Hi.

26:31.917 --> 26:34.375
- What are you two doing here?
- What are we doing here?

26:34.458 --> 26:39.500
Well, Edie hired me to cater.
So it's just business.

26:40.041 --> 26:43.959
- I don't know what her excuse is.
- You are so dead.

26:44.709 --> 26:47.625
I don't believe it. This is
an absolute betrayal of our friendship.

26:47.709 --> 26:49.375
Gabby, she asked me
to make 20 pizzas.

26:49.458 --> 26:51.250
I couldn't turn it down.

26:51.333 --> 26:54.625
This is so delicious.

26:54.709 --> 26:55.959
Is that what our friendship
is worth to you?

26:56.041 --> 26:57.792
Twenty pizzas? We had a pact!

26:57.875 --> 26:59.583
Come on, Gabby, be fair.

26:59.667 --> 27:01.834
You put us
in a really awkward position.

27:01.917 --> 27:05.208
- Me? You two owe me an apology!
- No. Gabby, be reasonable.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.792
I am leaving this party right now,

27:06.875 --> 27:09.667
and if you two don't come with me,
our friendship is over!

27:09.750 --> 27:11.750
- Gabby!
- No, I mean it! Right now.

27:13.083 --> 27:15.959
Carlos, stop! Put me down!

27:16.041 --> 27:17.500
What are you doing?

27:17.583 --> 27:20.625
Stop it! Carlos, put me down!

27:21.250 --> 27:23.291
How dare you maul me like that?

27:23.375 --> 27:25.166
You were ruining
Travers' birthday party.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.875
What the hell is wrong with you?

27:26.959 --> 27:29.458
I'm sorry.
Betrayal makes me a little cranky.

27:29.542 --> 27:31.875
Come on, Gabby.
You can't tell Susan and Lynette

27:31.959 --> 27:33.959
who they're allowed to be friends with.
It's ridiculous.

27:34.041 --> 27:36.375
I'll tell you what's ridiculous,
you not having the guts

27:36.458 --> 27:38.500
to tell me you were dating Edie!

27:38.583 --> 27:40.083
- Here it is.
- Yeah.

27:40.166 --> 27:42.959
I had to find out from her
at my damn engagement party!

27:43.041 --> 27:46.291
I had to hear that you were engaged
to that Victor guy on the news!

27:46.375 --> 27:49.583
I didn't plan it that way.
It was spur of the moment.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.125
So you just said, "Hey, what the heck?"

27:52.208 --> 27:55.375
- You even in love with this guy?
- Yes. Deeply!

28:03.667 --> 28:05.333
Must be nice.

28:06.375 --> 28:08.000
Well, aren't you in love with Edie?

28:08.083 --> 28:11.166
We're having fun together,
but it'll never be serious.

28:14.125 --> 28:18.458
So if I'm just dating,
and you're in love and getting married,

28:19.542 --> 28:22.500
remind me again why it is that
you get to be the angry one.

28:25.208 --> 28:26.834
I'm sorry, Carlos.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.500
You should be.

28:36.667 --> 28:38.375
<i>And for the first time,</i>

28:38.458 --> 28:42.792
<i>Gabrielle was willing to let Carlos</i>
<i>be with someone else...</i>

28:42.875 --> 28:44.542
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:44.625 --> 28:49.250
<i>...because she knew</i>
<i>he still belonged to her.</i>

28:51.917 --> 28:53.959
Feel free to take home
as much cake as you want.

28:54.041 --> 28:57.458
- I do not want to be tempted.
- I might take a little for Tom...

29:00.709 --> 29:03.542
Hi, Mrs McCluskey.

29:04.959 --> 29:06.875
Would you like some cake?

29:06.959 --> 29:09.583
I didn't come for sweets.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.250
I know you people
have been talking about me,

29:11.333 --> 29:14.417
and I guess the only way
to shut you up is to come clean.

29:14.500 --> 29:18.542
So who would like to hear
the gruesome details?

29:22.500 --> 29:24.959
- I would.
- If you feel like it...

29:25.041 --> 29:27.083
Yeah.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.959
First off, and I know
this will disappoint some of you,

29:30.041 --> 29:32.125
but I didn't kill Gilbert.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.250
I came home
from a weekend in Laughlin

29:35.333 --> 29:38.208
and found him in front of the TV. Dead.

29:39.250 --> 29:43.625
- He still had the remote in his hand.
- Good Lord.

29:43.709 --> 29:48.542
It was 2:00 a.m., so I decided to wait
until morning to call the funeral home.

29:48.625 --> 29:52.375
And I went to his desk to make sure
everything was in order.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.208
I found his pension plan,
and guess what.

29:57.166 --> 30:00.750
In the event of his death,
I was not the beneficiary.

30:02.041 --> 30:06.208
- Who was?
- His first wife.

30:06.291 --> 30:08.542
They were married
when he started the job, for two years.

30:08.625 --> 30:13.500
We were together for 34 years and
that idiot didn't change the paperwork.

30:16.083 --> 30:20.417
I not only lost my Gilbert,
but I was about to lose everything.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.250
So, I...

30:24.333 --> 30:28.125
You put him in the freezer
and kept cashing the cheques.

30:31.250 --> 30:33.750
Well, what else was I gonna do?

30:35.250 --> 30:39.000
Besides, after a while,
it was kind of nice having him around.

30:40.834 --> 30:43.375
Anyway, that's the truth.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.917
You ladies have my permission
to pass it along.

30:47.959 --> 30:50.834
Not that some of you ladies need it.

31:07.208 --> 31:10.000
Probably weren't expecting to see me?

31:10.083 --> 31:14.333
Well, after 20 unanswered calls,
no, not really.

31:14.417 --> 31:18.500
About that,
obviously I have been very confused.

31:20.542 --> 31:23.375
I finally saw a therapist.

31:23.458 --> 31:27.417
Actually, it was sort of
a court-ordered thing, anyway...

31:27.500 --> 31:30.417
Well, I need to talk to you.

31:34.834 --> 31:37.208
You sound sure.

31:37.667 --> 31:39.125
I am.

31:40.375 --> 31:42.125
I'm gonna marry Ian.

31:47.792 --> 31:50.208
Believe me, this wasn't easy.

31:51.208 --> 31:55.417
Especially when you started
to remember how it was between us.

31:57.834 --> 32:00.834
Maybe if the timing
had been different...

32:00.917 --> 32:02.875
Yet, it wasn't.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.250
I'm sorry, Mike.

32:11.792 --> 32:14.166
Well, at least I have my memories.

32:31.375 --> 32:32.792
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

32:32.875 --> 32:34.792
I told Kim that we'd be out
the rest of the evening,

32:34.875 --> 32:36.166
and she's gonna lock up.

32:36.250 --> 32:39.250
- Great, I'll just get my jacket.
- Okay.

32:46.792 --> 32:49.875
- Hey, you got a table for seven?
- Hey!

32:49.959 --> 32:52.500
- Hi! What are you doing here?
- Hey, Mom!

32:52.583 --> 32:54.583
Well, the kids wanted to surprise you,

32:54.667 --> 32:57.709
and it's been forever
since we've all had dinner together...

32:57.834 --> 33:01.750
Well, how did you get here?
I mean, you're not supposed to drive.

33:01.834 --> 33:06.000
I took a cab, a double dose
of the painkillers, and voila.

33:06.083 --> 33:08.208
- You surprised?
- Yeah, a little.

33:08.291 --> 33:10.792
- We missed you!
- I missed you, too.

33:10.875 --> 33:13.041
Hey, why don't you guys
go grab that big table,

33:13.125 --> 33:16.208
and I will have Rick
whip something up for us! Hi.

33:18.542 --> 33:21.041
- Wow, you smell good.
- It must be the basil.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.834
It has got a sweet smell.

33:23.917 --> 33:26.750
Hey, Kayla, can you get a high chair
for your sister?

33:26.834 --> 33:28.917
- Yeah.
- All right. Who wants pizza?

33:29.000 --> 33:31.750
- I do!
- Hi. Change of plans.

33:31.834 --> 33:34.208
Yeah, I see.

33:34.291 --> 33:37.583
- I'm sorry, you could still go.
- No, no, no, I'll stay.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.583
I'll cook for your family.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.375
Thanks. Thank you.

33:48.875 --> 33:52.375
Thanks, sweetie.
You are taking such good care of me.

33:52.500 --> 33:56.834
- When's Lynette getting home?
- As soon as she closes up the pizzeria.

33:56.917 --> 33:58.500
Is that guy Rick helping her?

33:58.583 --> 34:02.000
He better be,
for as much as we're paying him.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.792
I think Lynette likes him.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.083
Well, sure, he's a nice guy,
hard worker.

34:07.166 --> 34:10.583
No, I mean she likes him, likes him.

34:14.417 --> 34:17.125
What makes you say that?

34:17.208 --> 34:20.417
Just something I noticed.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.875
Well, good night, Daddy.

34:32.834 --> 34:36.625
"Mrs Susan Hainsworth."
God, I love the sound of that.

34:36.709 --> 34:39.875
Or did you want to keep your name?
Because I love the sound of that, too.

34:39.959 --> 34:42.667
As long as I get to call you my wife.

34:43.625 --> 34:44.875
Deal.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.041
You do realise we're gonna
be blissfully happy, don't you?

34:48.125 --> 34:52.208
I mean, it could actually get a
bit disgusting. People might throw fruit.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.250
I'm gonna lock up down here.

34:56.333 --> 34:59.834
Why don't you go upstairs
and warm up the bed?

35:02.417 --> 35:05.375
You do realise we're gonna
be great together, don't you?

35:05.458 --> 35:07.000
I know.

35:17.917 --> 35:20.375
<i>Hey, Susan. I don't mean to bug you.</i>

35:20.458 --> 35:23.875
<i>There's just so much</i>
<i>I didn't get to say.</i>

35:25.083 --> 35:27.959
<i>I... God, I'm lousy at goodbyes.</i>

35:28.041 --> 35:31.458
<i>Anyway, you will always</i>
<i>be the best thing</i>

35:31.542 --> 35:33.875
<i>that ever happened to me,</i>

35:33.959 --> 35:37.583
<i>and, well, I hope you find</i>
<i>the happiness you deserve.</i>

35:37.667 --> 35:41.583
<i>Bye. Oh, this is Mike.</i>

35:47.250 --> 35:49.500
<i>Hey, Susan. I don't mean to bug you.</i>

35:49.583 --> 35:52.458
<i>There's just so much</i>
<i>I didn't get to say.</i>

35:53.875 --> 35:56.542
<i>I... God, I'm lousy at goodbyes.</i>

35:56.625 --> 35:59.917
<i>Anyway, you will always</i>
<i>be the best thing</i>

36:00.000 --> 36:01.875
<i>that ever happened to me,</i>

36:01.959 --> 36:05.458
<i>and, well, I hope you find</i>
<i>the happiness you deserve.</i>

36:05.542 --> 36:08.417
<i>Bye. Oh, this is Mike.</i>

36:14.375 --> 36:15.750
Where are you going?

36:15.834 --> 36:18.291
Home, to England.

36:20.583 --> 36:22.375
To England? What's wrong?

36:22.458 --> 36:26.709
Well, it's just...
I don't think this is going to work.

36:26.792 --> 36:28.041
What?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.041
Just 10 minutes ago
we were making plans.

36:31.125 --> 36:33.709
And you were saying
how great we were gonna be together.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.375
I saw you listening
to that message from Mike.

36:39.375 --> 36:40.417
Oh.

36:43.959 --> 36:48.000
- Ian, I made my choice.
- But not for the right reasons.

36:48.083 --> 36:50.333
You're just trying to honour
a promise you made to me.

36:50.417 --> 36:52.250
That's not true.

36:55.375 --> 36:56.750
I will get over him.

36:56.834 --> 37:00.000
You've been trying to get over him
for as long as I've known you.

37:00.083 --> 37:03.083
Haven't had much luck, have you?

37:03.166 --> 37:06.417
- Ian, I love you.
- I know you do.

37:07.250 --> 37:10.000
But you love him a little bit more,
don't you?

37:20.291 --> 37:25.083
I can't live a life where every time
I see you with a faraway look,

37:25.166 --> 37:28.041
I'll wonder if you're thinking of him.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.083
I'm so sorry.

37:34.542 --> 37:36.750
You deserve to be happy.

37:38.917 --> 37:41.250
And so do I.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.250
Goodbye, Susan.

37:59.709 --> 38:02.875
- Hey, Mrs McCluskey.
- Lynette.

38:04.750 --> 38:09.208
Well, it turns out our new babysitter
isn't working out too well.

38:09.291 --> 38:11.250
You feel up to another tour of duty?

38:11.834 --> 38:12.875
Are you sure you want

38:12.959 --> 38:15.750
the Wisteria Witch
looking after your kids?

38:16.166 --> 38:19.000
My kids know you're not a witch.

38:19.083 --> 38:20.959
Too bad. I could use the leverage.

38:24.333 --> 38:26.834
- We missed you.
- Same here.

38:30.375 --> 38:33.625
I'm gonna need a raise, though.
I'm strapped.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.125
Okay.

38:42.542 --> 38:44.000
I just talked to Mrs McCluskey,

38:44.083 --> 38:47.250
and she is gonna start looking
after our kids again.

38:47.333 --> 38:48.834
- That's great.
- Yeah.

38:48.917 --> 38:52.166
Because actually, I have been thinking,

38:52.250 --> 38:56.208
and it is time that I got back to work.

38:57.083 --> 38:59.000
- What?
- Yeah. I'm feeling good.

38:59.083 --> 39:01.041
I'm getting around better.

39:01.125 --> 39:04.458
But the doctor said your recovery
would take months,

39:04.542 --> 39:06.250
and it's only been six weeks.

39:07.417 --> 39:10.291
Well, it's not like I'm gonna
dead-lift a bag of ice,

39:10.375 --> 39:13.000
but I can sprinkle cheese on a pizza.

39:13.083 --> 39:18.291
Besides, I hate making you run
that place by yourself.

39:18.375 --> 39:20.208
- I don't mind.
- Really?

39:20.291 --> 39:22.917
Because before you said
it was killing you.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.041
Yeah, well, you know, it is,

39:25.125 --> 39:28.083
but I just don't want you to come back
before you're ready.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.709
- You might re-injure yourself.
- I'll be careful.

39:31.792 --> 39:35.166
The best part is,
we can finally get Rick off the books.

39:35.291 --> 39:38.458
Rick?
Why would we want to let him go?

39:38.542 --> 39:42.458
Well, I know he's been great,
but his salary's cutting into our profits.

39:43.417 --> 39:47.750
Actually, he is bringing in more than
enough business to cover his salary.

39:47.834 --> 39:49.709
I mean, with all those new dishes
he's been cooking,

39:49.792 --> 39:51.875
he's got a lot of fans out there.

39:51.959 --> 39:53.458
- Does he really?
- Yeah.

39:53.542 --> 39:56.542
I think firing him
would be a huge mistake.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.875
Well, it was just a thought.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.917
Well, don't think so much.
Just rest and get better.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.083
That's what you need to do.

40:06.083 --> 40:08.208
- You gonna be late tonight?
- Probably.

40:08.291 --> 40:10.208
We've got a big party
coming in at 10:00.

40:10.291 --> 40:12.542
So I'll just see you in the morning.

40:13.792 --> 40:15.625
- I'll be here.
- Okay.

40:20.125 --> 40:21.458
Hi, Ida. What's up?

40:21.542 --> 40:24.959
That idiot postman mixed up
our mail again.

40:25.041 --> 40:27.709
Poor Mr Henley.
He does seem to be getting worse.

40:27.792 --> 40:30.625
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Have you heard about Mike?

40:30.709 --> 40:34.500
- No. What about him?
- He moved.

40:34.583 --> 40:36.500
Moved? What do you mean?

40:36.583 --> 40:40.375
Mona Clarke was up at 2:00
in the morning with acid reflux,

40:40.458 --> 40:44.250
and she saw him pack his car
and everything.

40:46.333 --> 40:47.375
Well, that doesn't make sense.

40:47.458 --> 40:49.667
Mike wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

40:49.750 --> 40:50.792
Well, he did.

40:50.875 --> 40:53.709
According to Carlos,
something bad happened,

40:53.792 --> 40:57.375
and Mike just wanted to
get the heck out of Dodge.

40:57.458 --> 41:01.458
It's a pity. I always liked him.

41:11.875 --> 41:15.667
<i>Gossip.</i>
<i>It's just a harmless form of recreation.</i>

41:16.959 --> 41:20.166
<i>It's careless talk that deals</i>
<i>in polite fiction.</i>

41:20.250 --> 41:22.333
I'd love to be assistant manager,

41:22.417 --> 41:26.500
but apparently you have to flirt
with Mrs Scavo to get that job.

41:26.583 --> 41:31.500
<i>It's nasty speculation</i>
<i>that's based on not-so-polite fact.</i>

41:31.583 --> 41:33.250
He may be dating Edie,

41:33.333 --> 41:36.125
but everyone can see
he's still in love with Gabby.

41:40.625 --> 41:42.625
<i>How do we protect ourselves</i>

41:42.709 --> 41:45.500
<i>from the venomous sting</i>
