<i> If you can explain why
this is blue, I'll let it go.</i>

00:04.939 --> 00:06.971
The ghost riders. The wild hunt.

00:06.974 --> 00:09.441
<i>They come by storm, and they take people.</i>

00:09.443 --> 00:11.043
Everyone is
forgetting everything...

00:11.045 --> 00:12.344
Who's stiles?

00:12.346 --> 00:13.645
Why don't you tell me your name?

00:13.647 --> 00:16.548
They're comin' for me.
Find some way to remember me.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.616
Remember I love you.

01:14.974 --> 01:16.108
Did you feel that?

01:16.110 --> 01:17.376
Feel what?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.479
Thought I heard something.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.716
Forget it. All right,
let's keep goin'.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.420
Or we could call it.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.988
We gotta work
on your back shots.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.123
Why?

01:31.125 --> 01:32.191
Liam. They suck.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.892
What are you talkin' about?

01:33.894 --> 01:36.361
Your back shots.
Which suck.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.177
I must've been thinkin'
of someone else.

01:52.179 --> 01:55.280
Yeah. Maybe someone else
who should be captain?

01:55.282 --> 01:56.782
We'll make it.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.654
Well, guess we have to go now.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.723
No, we don't.

02:18.671 --> 02:22.407
Okay, now stir in
the iron filings.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.809
How is this supposed to work?

02:23.811 --> 02:26.845
The ferromagnetic properties
are gonna interact with...

02:29.516 --> 02:31.817
Don't worry, it works.
Just make sure that

02:31.819 --> 02:36.455
all the iron oxide is completely absorbed.
Yeah.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.590
How come you're here
if you already know this?

02:38.592 --> 02:41.326
Know it? He's
practically teaching it.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.062
Well, this is, uh,
my favorite physics lab.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.464
We're all here
for the extra credit.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.799
I mean, don't you have, like,
a four point something?

02:47.801 --> 02:48.867
Four point nine.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.971
I didn't even know it went that high.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.640
I'm stuck at 2.7.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.408
Hey, look, you work two jobs.

02:56.410 --> 03:00.212
And dying didn't
exactly help your gpa.

03:00.214 --> 03:03.081
So, I don't know,
all you need is just

03:03.083 --> 03:05.284
a little help.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.085
You're doing this for me.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.424
Are you mad?

03:13.159 --> 03:14.493
Furious.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.337
Okay.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.640
There you go.

03:31.177 --> 03:32.844
It worked.

03:36.015 --> 03:38.951
Uh... uh... Is it supposed
to be that strong?

03:47.660 --> 03:49.394
What the hell
are you guys doing?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.663
Physics.
Extra credit.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.199
Extra credit?
At 9 o'clock at night?

03:54.201 --> 03:57.803
Come on, guys. Get the hell out of here.
Go have lives.

03:57.805 --> 04:00.405
Your teenage years are not the
time for academic achievement.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.607
Yes, they are.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.075
That's a lie sold to
you by the government.

04:03.077 --> 04:06.144
Go find some girls, get into trouble.
Live a little.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.512
Damn.
We're gay.

04:07.514 --> 04:10.816
Even better. Go gays!
Now get out of my face!

04:10.818 --> 04:13.852
I don't get paid to lock up
after you losers. Yes, you do.

04:13.854 --> 04:17.555
Get out of here! Go wreak some
havoc like the other kids.

04:21.560 --> 04:25.297
Uh... my phone.
I think I left it upstairs.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.732
Well...

05:13.513 --> 05:14.780
Mason?

08:20.366 --> 08:22.968
What's wrong? Something's
happening to Mason.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.645
They were here.
The ghost riders.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.181
Here? Just now?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.749
I thought they left
when the storm left.

08:37.751 --> 08:41.653
I guess not, because two of
them were right up there.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.421
What were they doing?

08:43.423 --> 08:47.359
We didn't see when they came in. We
only saw them when we turned invisible.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.521
You brought him into this?
He was trying to protect me.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.465
Uh, they didn't seem
to care about us.

08:53.467 --> 08:54.799
They, they walked right by us.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.067
Then what happened?

09:01.274 --> 09:05.377
Uh... then they
just jumped down and left.

09:07.613 --> 09:08.980
That's it?

09:09.949 --> 09:11.316
Yeah.

09:11.318 --> 09:14.920
They didn't take someone? There
was nobody else in here?

09:16.989 --> 09:19.991
No.
It was just us.

09:27.634 --> 09:30.168
That was, uh...

09:31.037 --> 09:33.138
Wow!

10:01.300 --> 10:04.536
I'm kind of not used to sleeping
like this...

10:14.080 --> 10:17.916
Are those chains? Shh.
It's nothing.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.761
<i> Do you see him?</i>

10:46.646 --> 10:48.813
Lydia, what's wrong?

10:48.815 --> 10:50.915
Did you hear that?
I heard you screaming.

10:50.917 --> 10:54.552
No. It was the sound of a train
passing through my room.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.922
Oh, honey, you were
having a nightmare.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.624
No, I wasn't.
It wasn't a...

10:59.626 --> 11:04.229
Well, there wasn't a train and we haven't
had an earthquake, so...

11:04.231 --> 11:06.498
It just must've been
a bad dream.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.940
But I wasn't asleep.

13:09.255 --> 13:12.090
Now that's what I'm talkin' about.
That's how it's done.

13:12.092 --> 13:15.360
That is captain material.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.694
You're late.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.696
Which makes you
not captain material.

13:18.698 --> 13:19.964
Liam is captain material.
He's...

13:21.101 --> 13:23.635
Let's go, gather around.
Listen up.

13:23.637 --> 13:28.940
Thanks to McCall's selfish
desire to focus on his "grades"

13:28.942 --> 13:32.443
and his "graduation,"
we are leaderless.

13:32.445 --> 13:36.648
You want to be a champion, you
wanna be a hero? Now's your shot.

13:42.388 --> 13:45.123
All right, all you
wannabe captains,

13:45.125 --> 13:47.759
I wanna see you guys
tear each other apart.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.368
Definitely not captain
material there, dumb-bar.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.171
"Dunbar."
Yeah. That's what I said.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.407
You said dumb-bar.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.643
And your mouth just
bought you equipment duty.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.483
Don't you have class?

14:13.886 --> 14:15.386
- Don't you?
- Shh.

14:17.156 --> 14:19.224
I can't stop thinking about last night.
Me either.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.291
Shh!

14:21.894 --> 14:24.329
I've read everything
about the wild hunt.

14:24.331 --> 14:27.899
You know, how they come in by storm,
collecting souls, riding lightning.

14:27.901 --> 14:31.536
But I just don't know why they were here.
You know, they're ghost riders.

14:31.538 --> 14:35.373
What were they doing in a high school
library? What are you doing here?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.075
I just had a feeling.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.444
About what?
Shh!

14:39.446 --> 14:42.447
We only saw them
'cause of your power.

14:42.449 --> 14:46.317
What if you have some kinda special
ability no one knows about?

14:47.853 --> 14:49.787
So? What do you feel?

14:51.423 --> 14:54.192
When the ghost
riders were up there...

14:55.828 --> 14:57.495
I think they were
holding something.

15:02.301 --> 15:04.569
Why can't we remember
what happened?

15:06.138 --> 15:09.207
What if they weren't
holding something...

15:11.377 --> 15:12.610
But someone?

15:21.520 --> 15:23.221
I blew it, didn't I?

15:24.690 --> 15:26.557
You blew it off.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.826
You'd have to be trying
in order to blow it.

15:31.363 --> 15:34.299
Maybe someone else
can be captain.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.535
With school work and all
the other stuff we have to deal with...

15:37.537 --> 15:40.171
Devenford prep started practice
three weeks before us.

15:40.173 --> 15:43.241
Riverside two weeks. We're
behind before we even start.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.210
Half our team can't even cradle
the ball, let alone score.

15:50.983 --> 15:52.450
Why can't you stay captain?

15:52.452 --> 15:55.787
I'm graduating. You know, I'm
not gonna be here next year.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.424
Somebody's gotta step up
and fill in the gap.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.293
It should be you.

16:02.728 --> 16:03.861
Yeah?

16:05.230 --> 16:06.864
Well, coach doesn't want me.

16:08.934 --> 16:10.335
I don't know
if the team wants me.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.804
It's not up to them.
It's up to you.

16:15.007 --> 16:18.776
You have to want this. Because
they're gonna keep comin' at you.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.813
They're gonna keep knocking you down.
And you have to get back up.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.948
You have to show them
that you can get back up.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.616
Leaders don't run.

16:30.522 --> 16:33.691
Now that's what I'm
talkin' about, McCall.

16:33.693 --> 16:38.096
That's exactly the
intensity this team needs.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.932
And you, I'm lookin'
forward to crushing

16:40.934 --> 16:43.468
that little adorable
baby face of yours.

17:22.107 --> 17:24.442
I'm impressed.
With most of you.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.277
It really speaks
to your study habits

17:26.279 --> 17:28.479
and your commitment
to your own education.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.882
Everyone else,
see me for extra help.

17:35.087 --> 17:36.854
Ms. Fleming, um...

17:36.856 --> 17:39.223
I already told you, Lydia, I don't give
extra credit for alternate equations

17:39.225 --> 17:41.526
based on your own
theoretical findings.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.994
Well, okay then.

17:42.996 --> 17:45.596
Malia. Claws.
Claws, Malia.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.512
Excuse
me, who are you?

19:10.315 --> 19:12.016
What are you doing
in this class?

19:43.048 --> 19:44.282
You want to see
the absentee list?

19:44.284 --> 19:46.017
Yes.
May I ask why?

19:48.687 --> 19:49.854
Werewolf stuff.

19:52.959 --> 19:56.994
I thought I made it clear that beacon hills
high school is a dedicated safe space.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.765
I had to convince 23 students that what
they saw in the library last semester

20:00.767 --> 20:03.634
was a large bear and the
fangs on Scott McCall

20:03.636 --> 20:06.270
were the result of acute teenage
hallucination syndrome.

20:06.272 --> 20:09.207
What is teenage
hallucination syndrome?

20:09.209 --> 20:10.808
I have no idea.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.311
But we think someone could be missing.
And they could be in danger.

20:13.313 --> 20:17.315
Well, I can assure you that nobody
has reported a student missing.

20:17.317 --> 20:22.620
And all absentees are
accounted for. Gentlemen,

20:22.622 --> 20:27.425
I appreciate your concern and I
thank you for your vigilance.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.861
Remember, safe space.
Now, go back to class.

20:30.863 --> 20:31.929
We don't have class.

20:32.798 --> 20:36.500
Then go back to
something. Anything.

21:04.896 --> 21:07.498
<i>You know me.
Oh, thank god, you know me.</i>

21:09.001 --> 21:10.067
<i>Do you see him?</i>

21:17.576 --> 21:21.312
<i>Do you see him? All right,</i>
<i>come on, come on!</i>

21:24.883 --> 21:28.919
<i> This way. Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!
This way, this way.</i>

21:31.124 --> 21:35.192
- Where are they? 
-<i> Everywhere! Will you forget me?</i>

21:35.194 --> 21:37.595
I won't... I won't!

21:37.597 --> 21:39.463
Lydia, look out!

21:43.402 --> 21:45.036
Are you okay?

21:45.038 --> 21:46.103
I'm fine.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.239
What were you doing?

21:50.376 --> 21:51.876
Trying to remember.

21:52.911 --> 21:54.512
No one's unaccounted for?

21:54.514 --> 21:58.482
You can reword the question as much
as you want. The answer is still no.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.217
Do you feel anything?

22:00.219 --> 22:03.954
Does your hellhound intuition sense
something wrong with the supernatural?

22:03.956 --> 22:06.724
I'm a harbinger of death.
Not a harbinger of kidnapping.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.360
I'm also a sheriff's deputy
working on an unsolved murder,

22:09.362 --> 22:11.495
that for once doesn't
involve shape shifters,

22:11.497 --> 22:14.365
resurrected 18th century
serial killers, or me.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.834
It's just a straightforward
robbery-homicide.

22:16.836 --> 22:16.834
"Straightforward?"

22:16.836 --> 22:20.137
He was bludgeoned to death and
stuffed in a high school air duct.

22:20.139 --> 22:24.442
And I already have your statement. Have
a great day, Mason. You too, Corey.

22:50.302 --> 22:52.069
Whatcha doin'?

22:55.674 --> 23:00.077
Uh, nothing. Just
checking out this locker.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.812
Is it yours?

23:03.749 --> 23:06.283
Not really.

23:06.285 --> 23:10.588
I'm relatively new here, but I'm pretty
sure breakin' into someone else's locker

23:10.590 --> 23:13.824
is against the rules.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.193
I'm not breaking into
someone else's locker.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.395
What does it look like to you?

23:19.931 --> 23:22.833
It looks like I'm breaking into
someone else's locker.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.504
Yeah, uh, I think
I'll go to class now.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.539
Yeah, probably a good idea.

23:40.720 --> 23:46.590
They must have had someone up there. I
mean, that's the only logical explanation.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.858
Yeah.
How do you know?

23:47.860 --> 23:50.761
Logic. And Corey
has a hunch.

23:50.763 --> 23:55.332
What? Is that a chameleon thing? I
thought all they could do was disappear.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.135
Corey just wants to help.

23:58.137 --> 24:01.057
Yeah, where was he when we were fighting
a nine foot werewolf to save you?

24:01.406 --> 24:03.207
And why was he loyal
to Theo for so long?

24:03.209 --> 24:08.979
There was a time where we all
trusted Theo, including you.

24:08.981 --> 24:12.683
I'll trust him when he does
something trustworthy.

24:12.685 --> 24:17.221
Unlike right now, when I can hear his
heart racing from across the room.

24:19.225 --> 24:23.461
What about Hayden? You
forgave her, no problem.

24:23.463 --> 24:28.065
She almost died that night trying to
stop Sebastien. All you did was hide.

24:28.067 --> 24:31.101
What was I supposed to do? You
and Hayden have claws and fangs.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.870
Liam, look, it's not like
chameleons are the

24:32.872 --> 24:34.638
apex predator of the
animal kingdom.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.874
All Corey can do is disappear.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.280
Then maybe that's what
he should do.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.956
What?

24:51.958 --> 24:54.358
How is he supposed to trust you
if you're hiding in the walls?

24:54.360 --> 24:55.926
I already told you.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.408
Your friends aren't my friends.
Why can't you just accept that?

24:59.898 --> 25:04.635
That might work for you guys,
but that doesn't work for me.

25:07.006 --> 25:13.244
I keep having this feeling like there's
pieces missing. Holes in my memory.

25:13.246 --> 25:17.014
Like this. I took that from a
windshield at the sheriff's impound lot

25:17.016 --> 25:19.984
but I can't remember
why I was there.

25:19.986 --> 25:23.420
The subconscious can be
a conduit for our memories.

25:23.422 --> 25:28.826
Dreams and waking dreams can be
powerful tools to help us remember.

25:28.828 --> 25:34.498
Could it all be connected? The
ghost riders, the wild hunt, the holes?

25:34.500 --> 25:37.268
The wild hunt are drawn
to war and mayhem.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.670
I've never heard of it doing
anything to anyone's memory.

25:43.108 --> 25:46.510
It's almost like you have a
form of phantom limb syndrome.

25:46.512 --> 25:51.515
It's common in war. Amputees can
have the sensation of an itch

25:51.517 --> 25:55.319
they can't scratch or a pain
that couldn't possibly be there.

25:55.321 --> 25:59.390
The missing limb is so important, the
brain acts like the limb's still there.

25:59.392 --> 26:03.494
So, my subconscious is trying
to tell me what's missing?

26:03.496 --> 26:04.762
It may be.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.065
How the hell do I figure
out what it's saying?

26:08.067 --> 26:11.168
Well, the easiest way to do that
would be to simply go to sleep.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.268
- Hello?
- Over here.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.046
Has it really come to this?

28:36.048 --> 28:38.215
Can you give me a hand?

28:38.217 --> 28:43.287
If this is a new after-school
club, Count me out?

28:43.289 --> 28:47.057
I've got a problem. I'm
growling at people in class.

28:47.059 --> 28:52.930
I'm clawing at my desk. I tried turning the
floor of my bedroom into a coyote den.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.533
Do these look familiar to you?

28:57.435 --> 28:59.770
No. Why would it?

28:59.772 --> 29:02.306
Malia, do you really think this
is going to keep you safe?

29:02.308 --> 29:07.411
They used to. Before the lake house, this
is where I'd come for the full moon.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.080
But you weren't down here with me.
Scott wasn't down here with me.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.683
Right, so...

29:12.685 --> 29:13.951
Who was?

29:19.924 --> 29:21.325
You couldn't have done it alone.

29:27.665 --> 29:28.932
It's Scott.

29:46.518 --> 29:50.220
Hey, I went to bed at home and
I woke up out in the woods.

29:50.222 --> 29:53.490
About a mile out. I think there's
a reason why this has happened.

29:53.492 --> 29:57.027
I've been out here before. It was
the beginning of sophomore year

29:57.029 --> 29:58.629
the night before
tryouts for first line.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.871
<i>I remember because it was</i>
<i>all that I could think about.</i>

30:04.102 --> 30:05.903
What were you doing?

30:05.905 --> 30:07.171
I was looking for a dead body.

30:10.608 --> 30:12.242
That's morbid.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.511
So then, what was
I doing out here all alone?

30:14.513 --> 30:17.447
I wish I could help you,
but I didn't know you then.

30:17.449 --> 30:20.584
I was still a coyote so
I might've tried to eat it.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.487
Deaton said that my subconscious
is trying to tell me something.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.790
But I need you guys to help me
figure out what it's saying.

30:26.792 --> 30:30.127
Maybe you were just a curious
teenager. You heard there was a body.

30:30.129 --> 30:34.832
But how? I never watched the news.
And I didn't have a police scanner.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.366
Your mom works at the hospital.

30:36.368 --> 30:39.002
Maybe she got called in
and you overheard her?

30:39.004 --> 30:40.737
My mom wasn't home that night.

30:42.273 --> 30:45.209
I live five miles away from here.
How did I get here?

30:45.211 --> 30:48.178
You drove.
I didn't have a car.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.782
You ran. I couldn't have.
I had asthma.

30:53.853 --> 30:56.286
I was hiding, but they
knew that I was here.

30:56.288 --> 30:59.790
Maybe you made a ton of noise
with your asthmatic breathing.

30:59.792 --> 31:01.525
How would they
know that it was me?

31:02.594 --> 31:04.862
<i>Scott!</i>

31:04.864 --> 31:08.365
Scott, you out there?
<i> Scott?</i>

31:08.367 --> 31:11.835
Why would the sheriff even think
that I would be out here?

31:11.837 --> 31:15.405
Because like most deaths in this town,
it was related to the supernatural.

31:15.407 --> 31:20.944
I wasn't supernatural. I mean, this
was the night that I was bitten.

31:25.717 --> 31:30.721
I wasn't a werewolf yet.
And I wasn't out here alone.

31:47.071 --> 31:48.772
I just wanted to tell you...

31:51.876 --> 31:53.744
That I was wrong.

31:55.179 --> 31:58.081
I thought we could hate each
other and it wouldn't matter.

31:58.083 --> 32:04.688
But it does matter. It matters to Mason.
And he matters to both of us.

32:06.357 --> 32:09.259
I'm not trying to come
between you.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.863
And neither am I. But if
we keep up like this,

32:12.865 --> 32:14.965
he might feel
like he has to choose.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.801
You want me to just act
like nothing happened?

32:17.803 --> 32:23.307
We could work together. Maybe we
could find something together.

32:24.909 --> 32:26.476
Yeah, like what?

32:27.845 --> 32:29.279
Like a trace of them.

32:30.581 --> 32:31.648
A ghost rider.

32:35.019 --> 32:37.454
I know
this sounds crazy.

32:38.990 --> 32:41.458
But I think I had a best friend.

32:43.061 --> 32:44.861
And I think he was
out here with me that night.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.730
It doesn't sound crazy.

32:46.732 --> 32:50.067
I know that someone chained me up and
I think they wanted me to stay human.

32:50.069 --> 32:54.504
I came to school this morning and I was
sure I was supposed to meet someone.

32:54.506 --> 32:57.607
But I couldn't remember who
it was supposed to be.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.410
I have been
looking for them all day.

33:01.412 --> 33:04.881
Whoever it is,
I think I loved him.

33:09.587 --> 33:11.555
What if we're all missing
the same person?

33:19.897 --> 33:21.665
I think that he was
in this picture.

33:25.036 --> 33:26.470
He was sitting right there.

33:36.114 --> 33:38.382
You want to do this?
Hold my hand.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.399
Wow.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.634
The cube truck driver's name
was Nick Mazzara.

33:57.636 --> 34:00.971
He has a record of petty theft and
dealing drugs but nothing violent.

34:00.973 --> 34:05.075
He was a driver of a medical supply company
which gave him access to hospital supplies.

34:05.077 --> 34:06.810
Like helium.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.012
Why does a hospital need
helium in the first place?

34:09.014 --> 34:12.349
It's for heliox therapy. It's mostly
used for respiratory injuries

34:12.351 --> 34:15.452
caused by fires or explosions.
Burn victims from Afghanistan

34:15.454 --> 34:17.420
were treated with it at the
local recovery hospitals.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.089
Okay, what about our hospital?

34:19.091 --> 34:22.025
Someone's been raiding the supply for
months. I'm also compiling a list

34:22.027 --> 34:25.562
of mazzara's known associates. I can
start interviews in the morning.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.632
Nice work, Parrish.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.835
Oh, and your wife's waiting
for you in your office.

34:31.837 --> 34:32.902
My wife?

34:42.380 --> 34:43.847
I thought I'd surprise you.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.774
Do you even know
what we're looking for?

35:12.343 --> 35:15.545
If it's a book, we'll be here a while.

35:25.756 --> 35:26.823
Do you see that?

35:27.658 --> 35:32.762
Let go. Do you still
see the card?

35:34.699 --> 35:36.099
No. It's gone.

35:45.943 --> 35:49.613
Can you see it now?
Yeah. I can.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.419
I had a hunch you probably
forgot about dinner.

35:56.421 --> 36:03.326
Oh, it's uh... what, uh,
what, what is "quinoa"?

36:03.328 --> 36:05.829
It's quinoa.
Quinoa and Kale.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.397
Oh, that's, that's...

36:08.799 --> 36:12.302
Well, You're
always lookin' out for me.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.337
Well, I want you around
for a long, long time.

36:17.742 --> 36:19.643
Mmm.

36:43.234 --> 36:44.501
Happy?

36:44.969 --> 36:46.036
Always.

37:03.020 --> 37:07.857
It's just like in physics. It
wasn't there until you saw it.

37:07.859 --> 37:12.462
Then it became real.
It's Schrรถdinger's cat.

37:12.464 --> 37:15.065
The quantum state
of a superposition.

37:15.067 --> 37:20.103
To see something is to change its
very existence. It changed reality.

37:20.871 --> 37:20.870
I still don't get it.

37:20.872 --> 37:25.375
What do you think it is? It looks like
a library card. Except its blank.

37:36.120 --> 37:40.056
Jake Sullivan. He was in the
physics lab last night.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.591
I completely forgot about him.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.829
Me too. We have
Spanish together.

37:53.238 --> 37:55.705
<i> They erased him.</i>

37:58.342 --> 37:59.976
Your hunch was right.

38:14.726 --> 38:18.295
Uh, hey. What is it, Dunbar?
I'm busy online.

38:18.297 --> 38:19.596
I wanna sign up
for team captain.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.731
Yeah, it's too late.
I said end of the day.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.833
You didn't say
end of school day.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.537
Hey. What changed your mind?

38:28.139 --> 38:29.739
I held a guy's hand.

38:32.977 --> 38:36.513
I get it. I totally get it.

38:41.853 --> 38:44.421
Now she just magically
writes down all the answers?

38:44.423 --> 38:45.889
It's not quite that simple.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.957
It never is.

38:47.959 --> 38:51.728
In automatic writing, the hand moves
outside of any conscious awareness.

38:51.730 --> 38:56.032
Now hopefully the silence, the darkness, and
the light will allow you to find a more

38:56.034 --> 38:59.235
comfortable, relaxed,
trance-like state.

38:59.237 --> 39:04.574
Lydia, I want you to stare into the light.
And let go of all thought.

39:29.433 --> 39:32.936
I have to warn you. We may not be
able to access these memories.

39:32.938 --> 39:32.936
Why not?

39:32.938 --> 39:37.407
The legend has always been that
the wild hunt takes people.

39:37.409 --> 39:42.178
But if what you're telling me is
right, the truth is much worse.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.547
They erase people from reality.

39:54.959 --> 39:58.261
How did we remember someone who has
been completely erased from our minds?

40:08.472 --> 40:09.973
Maybe he hasn't been.

40:15.613 --> 40:17.580
Oh, is she...
Should we stop her?

40:17.582 --> 40:19.983
Lydia? Lydia?
Slow down.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.724
Is she okay?

40:29.260 --> 40:30.326
Lydia?

40:40.571 --> 40:42.105
What does "mischief" mean?

40:44.608 --> 40:46.109
That's not what she wrote.

41:02.092 --> 41:03.960
What the hell is a stiles?
