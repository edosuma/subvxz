01:05.558 --> 01:07.393
Find out what you've got

01:07.460 --> 01:11.464
and if it's one of 30
bulls of the whole pen,

01:11.497 --> 01:12.629
you're hurtin'.

01:12.631 --> 01:15.199
Your meniscus is hurting,

01:15.201 --> 01:18.404
your carpal tunnel
is bothering you,

01:18.471 --> 01:20.805
and so you just pay
a few then you leave.

01:20.807 --> 01:23.176
Call people out like
for stealing your stuff

01:23.209 --> 01:25.409
behind the shoot again.

01:25.411 --> 01:29.248
Four-second ride, put that
baby in slow motion, 60%.

01:29.315 --> 01:32.216
That's an eight-second ride
on social media, people.

01:32.218 --> 01:36.022
I mean, you're at school in
math class, like, oh oh oh.

01:36.055 --> 01:37.321
On to the next one.

01:37.323 --> 01:40.827
Every single post put
"On to the next one."

01:40.860 --> 01:42.862
The last thing you wanna-

01:51.404 --> 01:53.272
- Lovely day, lovely day.

01:57.911 --> 01:59.178
Yeah.

01:59.212 --> 02:00.046
How you guys doing
over here, huh?

02:01.014 --> 02:02.780
Another day, another dollar.

02:02.782 --> 02:06.786
♪ Lovely day, lovely day ♪

02:06.853 --> 02:08.419
Ah.

02:08.420 --> 02:12.859
♪ Lovely day, lovely
day, lovely day ♪

02:13.759 --> 02:15.026
Oh.

02:15.028 --> 02:16.229
Pest control?

02:17.463 --> 02:18.898
- Oh.
- Don't move.

02:20.967 --> 02:22.133
Don't turn around.

02:22.135 --> 02:23.302
- Don't turn around.
- Okay.

02:23.369 --> 02:25.204
- Act natural.
- Okay.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.074
That's fucking natural?

02:28.107 --> 02:29.240
Get the fuck in here, you
stupid son of a bitch.

02:29.242 --> 02:30.409
What are you doing?

02:30.443 --> 02:33.044
- You stupid shit.
- Okay, okay.

02:36.249 --> 02:37.815
Leave it.

02:37.817 --> 02:38.885
Let it bleed.

02:41.554 --> 02:43.054
What do you want?

02:43.056 --> 02:44.655
Texas Downs.

02:44.657 --> 02:45.489
Two weeks ago.

02:45.491 --> 02:46.725
You made a bet.

02:52.398 --> 02:53.833
I don't have it.

02:57.270 --> 02:59.436
Is that going to
be your final answer?

02:59.438 --> 03:02.506
What do you want me to say?

03:02.508 --> 03:04.510
Look I have, I
have kids at home-

03:04.577 --> 03:08.414
- They know that their dad's
a degenerate piece of shit?

03:08.447 --> 03:09.282
Huh?

03:11.084 --> 03:11.916
The watch.

03:11.918 --> 03:12.749
The chain.

03:12.751 --> 03:13.584
The ring.

03:13.586 --> 03:15.454
That buys you two days.

03:19.425 --> 03:20.960
The ring?

03:20.994 --> 03:24.328
You either give me that ring,
or you give me that finger.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.799
That choice is pretty easy.

03:26.832 --> 03:27.865
What?

04:04.503 --> 04:06.337
You ever bet on the horses?

04:06.339 --> 04:07.173
No.

04:08.975 --> 04:10.977
You ought to give it a try.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.378
It's easy to fix.

04:13.546 --> 04:14.380
Yeah.

04:15.814 --> 04:20.153
Jockey gives you the signal,
the fix is in, odds go up.

04:20.185 --> 04:22.486
Just like clockwork.

04:22.488 --> 04:24.190
I'll remember that.

04:32.431 --> 04:35.001
Usually these envelopes
are filled with cash-

04:35.034 --> 04:36.235
- He was light.

04:43.242 --> 04:44.577
And this?

04:44.610 --> 04:47.046
I gave him two days.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.247
That's a message
so he don't forget.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.348
A message?

04:51.350 --> 04:52.449
From who?

04:52.451 --> 04:54.620
He's got three
little girls at home.

04:54.687 --> 04:56.355
You want your money, or not?

04:56.389 --> 04:58.755
If I want you
to send a message,

04:58.757 --> 05:00.960
I'll tell you to send a message.

05:01.027 --> 05:03.027
What do you want
me to do with it now?

05:03.029 --> 05:04.528
Sew it back on?

05:04.530 --> 05:08.701
I want you to shut up and
do what you're told to do!

05:14.307 --> 05:17.043
The finger comes
out of your end.

05:18.611 --> 05:20.911
I'm going to need some
time off after this.

05:20.913 --> 05:21.814
Time off?

05:22.948 --> 05:26.619
You own a time share
that I don't know about?

05:26.652 --> 05:27.586
I'm done.

05:31.257 --> 05:32.223
Just go home.

05:32.225 --> 05:33.426
Okay?

05:33.459 --> 05:34.791
Get some rest.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.896
Come back in two
days and we'll talk.

05:53.946 --> 05:54.778
See you, Boone.

05:54.780 --> 05:55.781
All right.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.857
How's the back?

06:04.923 --> 06:05.758
Hurts.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.595
The leg?

06:09.628 --> 06:11.528
Hurts worse.

06:11.530 --> 06:14.698
My brother had a
picture of you from 2008.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.801
He framed it.

06:18.137 --> 06:19.336
Look at that.

06:20.539 --> 06:21.372
Good looking guy.

06:21.374 --> 06:22.208
Yeah.

06:23.842 --> 06:27.680
Hey look, I'm sorry to
hear about your mother.

06:31.384 --> 06:33.350
Word travels fast in
this town, don't it?

06:33.352 --> 06:35.988
Yeah, well, that's
a small town for you.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.354
You can resent it but in the end

06:37.356 --> 06:39.692
you're just another part of it.

06:39.725 --> 06:41.494
Anyway, she was nice.

06:43.129 --> 06:44.628
The beer is on me tonight, okay?

06:44.630 --> 06:45.462
All right.

06:45.464 --> 06:46.297
Have a good night.

06:46.299 --> 06:47.300
Thank you.

09:01.300 --> 09:02.167
Goddamn it.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.545
I should have knocked.

09:47.713 --> 09:50.416
Can't seem to
keep anything down.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.388
I'll call the
doctor first thing.

09:57.390 --> 09:59.055
Take pills to go to sleep.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.058
Pills to wake up.

10:00.092 --> 10:02.761
What the hell is the difference?

10:05.163 --> 10:09.733
The difference is that
something is going to work.

10:09.735 --> 10:10.569
Maybe.

10:12.571 --> 10:15.908
Maybe I'll just shut
my eyes tonight and

10:18.411 --> 10:22.247
by the morning this
nightmare is finally over.

10:23.716 --> 10:25.951
You can't talk like that.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.628
I saw the bank sent
another letter.

10:36.795 --> 10:38.297
A few days ago.

10:38.364 --> 10:39.530
When were you going
to tell me about it?

10:39.532 --> 10:41.632
- I wasn't.
- Why the hell not?

10:41.634 --> 10:44.303
The letter was
addressed to me.

10:49.041 --> 10:51.744
I'll call the loan
officer first thing.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.111
The doctor after.

10:56.081 --> 10:57.215
In that order.

10:59.885 --> 11:01.785
Which one of these
help you sleep?

11:01.787 --> 11:03.622
I already took them.

11:06.459 --> 11:07.726
Good.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.496
You won't mind if
I steal a couple.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.802
There's the amount of the
loan pay off, right there.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.003
Three copies.

11:20.005 --> 11:22.608
You've got to do
the same to each.

11:24.443 --> 11:25.976
I sign this and hand
you over that money

11:25.978 --> 11:27.680
and that house is mine?

11:27.746 --> 11:30.246
As long as the payment is
made by end of this week.

11:30.248 --> 11:33.586
Once that happens, the
house is untouchable.

11:33.619 --> 11:36.288
But you've got to give
me a check by Friday.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.821
The bank closes at five.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.990
Otherwise, come Monday
they will foreclose

11:39.992 --> 11:43.095
and take your mother's land.

11:43.128 --> 11:44.963
Well this takes care
of the reverse mortgage

11:44.997 --> 11:47.130
and the back property tax.

11:47.132 --> 11:48.467
Anything else?

11:48.501 --> 11:49.802
That'll do it.

11:52.337 --> 11:55.441
How long have we
known each other?

11:55.474 --> 11:57.142
Since we were kids.

11:58.377 --> 11:59.376
And I never once asked you how

11:59.378 --> 12:01.814
you made this kind of money.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.514
I told you.

12:03.516 --> 12:04.983
Rodeo insurance.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.183
Since when do they start
giving out PPOs to bull riders?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.020
Huh?

12:11.189 --> 12:12.491
She can never know about this.

12:12.525 --> 12:13.358
Yes?

12:15.327 --> 12:16.827
Rodeo?

12:16.829 --> 12:17.663
Rodeo.

12:19.498 --> 12:20.666
Thanks, Billy.

12:35.548 --> 12:39.818
Bet you had a good time
putting her in the trailer.

12:41.019 --> 12:42.521
This one?

12:42.555 --> 12:45.390
Goddamn, 1500 pound
Texas tornado.

12:48.326 --> 12:50.393
You want to pet him?

12:50.395 --> 12:52.330
Maybe next year.

12:52.364 --> 12:54.700
So what brings you up here?

12:54.733 --> 12:56.435
Came to see Palmer.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.173
He bought a stallion.

13:01.206 --> 13:04.708
Bringing him in this afternoon
if you want to hang out.

13:04.710 --> 13:06.011
I can do that.

13:07.079 --> 13:08.246
The boys busy?

13:10.248 --> 13:11.083
For you?

13:13.085 --> 13:15.752
They'll make time for you.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.753
Come on.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.265
Out!

13:52.124 --> 13:53.790
All right, listen here.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.292
I think we can make some
money off of these guys today.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.796
The way they've been roping.

13:57.830 --> 13:59.097
What do you think?

13:59.131 --> 14:00.396
Man, I had a late
night last night,

14:00.398 --> 14:02.232
but I think I'm up for it.

14:02.234 --> 14:03.634
I am too.

14:03.636 --> 14:04.801
How much you got?

14:04.803 --> 14:06.605
I've got 200 to put on it.

14:06.639 --> 14:07.838
Let's do it.

14:07.840 --> 14:08.805
Hey, boys.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.179
What you got?

14:14.246 --> 14:15.512
I've got 200 here

14:15.514 --> 14:18.649
that says you boys can't
rope half as fast as us.

14:18.651 --> 14:19.518
I'll play with you.

14:19.585 --> 14:20.416
He'll play.

14:20.418 --> 14:22.420
We'll dang sure play.

14:22.454 --> 14:24.821
- Well let's see-
- Show your money.

14:24.823 --> 14:25.991
Let's do it.

14:29.094 --> 14:30.093
I'm short.

14:30.095 --> 14:31.161
Short again?

14:31.163 --> 14:34.164
- Typical team roper.
- Go figure.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.133
Let's do some gambling, boys.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.800
Sweet, thanks.

14:36.802 --> 14:38.001
Who's up first?

14:38.003 --> 14:40.606
We'll let you girls go first.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.956
There you go!

15:13.171 --> 15:16.072
About ready to
give it another go?

15:16.074 --> 15:16.909
Me?

15:18.010 --> 15:18.844
Hell no.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.681
A lot easier
than riding a bull.

15:24.683 --> 15:25.982
A lot safer for that matter.

15:27.219 --> 15:28.553
Goddamn right.

15:31.223 --> 15:32.557
It ain't that.

15:32.591 --> 15:33.425
It, shit.

15:36.895 --> 15:37.728
I don't know.

15:40.866 --> 15:42.200
You're afraid.

15:46.404 --> 15:50.406
Even cowboys get scared
from time to time.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.879
Yeah.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.411
Maybe if you were
a better bull rider

15:55.413 --> 15:56.579
you wouldn't have gotten
bucked off to begin with-

15:56.581 --> 15:57.413
- You son of a bitch.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.250
Goddamn it.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.052
Hey, you all.

16:02.054 --> 16:04.723
Look who came to pay us a visit.

16:08.961 --> 16:10.195
I'll go get him.

16:10.228 --> 16:11.229
All right.

16:29.648 --> 16:30.983
Don't be greedy.

16:34.252 --> 16:38.256
My father used to say,
if a horse could speak,

16:39.992 --> 16:43.960
you wouldn't like
what he'd have to say.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.899
I didn't expect to
see you up here.

16:51.436 --> 16:52.669
What can I say?

16:52.671 --> 16:54.339
I missed the fellas.

16:57.275 --> 17:00.813
Hey, I don't pay you
all to clown around!

17:02.147 --> 17:04.582
Keep waiting for the day
you'll sell him to me.

17:04.616 --> 17:06.952
He'd make a fine race horse.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.585
I didn't buy him to
put him up for sale.

17:10.454 --> 17:11.790
Shame.

17:11.824 --> 17:14.523
Well, I guess it's
like asking the barber

17:14.526 --> 17:16.194
if I need a haircut.

17:17.329 --> 17:19.330
Same answer, every time.

17:21.598 --> 17:22.800
Come on in the barn.

17:22.835 --> 17:24.800
You can watch me
drink a cold one.

17:24.803 --> 17:27.806
Oh, that sounds
like a lot of fun.

17:29.374 --> 17:31.708
The team must be
doing pretty well.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.343
Not bad.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.479
It would be a whole lot better

17:34.512 --> 17:37.049
if you were still a part of it.

17:37.950 --> 17:40.350
Never was much for roping.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.721
Yeah, well these
cowboys can't seem

17:42.788 --> 17:46.556
to grasp the one
skill you always had.

17:46.558 --> 17:48.160
You knew it was better
to keep your mouth shut

17:48.193 --> 17:51.797
and look stupid, than
open it and prove it.

17:55.167 --> 17:57.567
I heard about your momma.

17:57.569 --> 17:58.837
Terrible thing.

18:01.673 --> 18:03.406
I appreciate that.

18:03.408 --> 18:05.911
You could come back to work?

18:08.046 --> 18:10.148
I already got a job.

18:10.182 --> 18:11.683
Yeah.

18:11.716 --> 18:15.151
Throwing your weight around so
someone else doesn't have to.

18:15.153 --> 18:18.156
The bank is going
to take the house.

18:18.190 --> 18:21.257
And you won't sell me the horse?

18:21.259 --> 18:24.227
I ain't having this
conversation, Palmer.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.835
You've always treated
me like a son.

18:31.837 --> 18:33.738
But you've got to stop.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.741
I can look after my own.

18:36.775 --> 18:37.774
Fine.

18:37.776 --> 18:39.242
You don't want to ride?

18:39.244 --> 18:41.246
Then you get back
up on the bull.

18:41.279 --> 18:44.280
That much, you were good at.

18:44.282 --> 18:46.051
Bull broke my back.

18:47.052 --> 18:49.054
Bull broke your heart.

18:50.422 --> 18:52.923
Look, this life we choose
will always give us

18:52.925 --> 18:54.559
something to fall back on.

18:54.592 --> 18:57.861
And sooner or later we
all land flat on it.

18:57.863 --> 19:00.866
Listen to what I'm
telling you, son.

19:04.636 --> 19:06.471
Boone, you chickenshit!

19:06.538 --> 19:07.906
Get your ass over here!

19:07.940 --> 19:08.939
Now!

19:08.941 --> 19:10.406
What the hell happened?

19:10.408 --> 19:11.908
Oh, you know what's going
on, you son of a bitch.

19:11.910 --> 19:13.243
Yeah, yeah.

19:13.245 --> 19:14.710
You think you can
sleep with my sister,

19:14.712 --> 19:16.081
and kick her the curb
like a piece of trash?

19:16.114 --> 19:17.613
I didn't kick
anyone to the curb.

19:17.615 --> 19:18.884
Goddamn it, she left me!

19:18.917 --> 19:19.818
Bullshit!

19:20.819 --> 19:23.088
Come on, Boone, get up.

19:23.121 --> 19:23.956
Be a man.

19:26.258 --> 19:27.425
You want to beat the
shit out of each other

19:27.459 --> 19:29.092
for an hour over
Brenda, goddamn it!

19:29.094 --> 19:30.560
I want to spend
all damn night, you-

19:35.100 --> 19:36.768
Fuck this.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.101
- Come on, Jeremiah.
- Goddamn it.

19:38.103 --> 19:39.104
You should have
thought about it

19:39.137 --> 19:40.603
before you fucked my sister.

19:43.508 --> 19:46.578
You want me to break this up?

19:46.611 --> 19:48.113
No.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.745
This is cowboy shit.

19:51.917 --> 19:54.017
Yeah, come on, Boone.

20:39.131 --> 20:42.634
Don't nothing
change with you cowboys, huh?

20:42.667 --> 20:45.670
Jeremiah told me what happened.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.138
Surprise, surprise.

20:48.140 --> 20:50.206
What the hell are
you doing here?

20:50.208 --> 20:53.745
I came to bring your
mother some flowers.

20:55.747 --> 20:57.682
Is she asleep?

20:57.715 --> 20:58.548
Yeah.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.050
I helped put her to bed.

21:00.052 --> 21:01.219
She isn't well.

21:02.354 --> 21:03.521
I know that.

21:04.656 --> 21:07.859
So, what are you
going to do about it?

21:09.527 --> 21:10.726
Are you reading my mail now?

21:10.728 --> 21:13.531
This is addressed
to your mother.

21:13.565 --> 21:16.899
Well that's
something couples do.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.037
Read each other's mail.

21:19.071 --> 21:20.536
I just glanced at it.

21:20.538 --> 21:23.773
Yeah, well, we ain't
a couple no more.

21:23.775 --> 21:25.075
That's right.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.711
You're an asshole.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.278
- That's why we aren't.
- Okay.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.112
Come on, Brenda!

21:29.114 --> 21:29.946
Come on, goddamn it!

21:29.948 --> 21:30.848
Just stay!

21:30.882 --> 21:31.883
- Look, I can't-
- Please.

21:31.916 --> 21:32.750
I can't.

21:33.952 --> 21:35.353
Why not?

21:35.387 --> 21:38.090
Because that's
what couples do.

21:39.091 --> 21:41.593
- Asshole.
- God damn it.

21:41.626 --> 21:42.458
Brenda!

21:42.460 --> 21:44.127
Brenda, hold on.

21:45.197 --> 21:46.564
What?

21:46.598 --> 21:49.565
I'm paying the bank Friday.

21:49.567 --> 21:52.570
And the house, it
will be in my name.

21:55.207 --> 21:56.708
We could fix it up.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.277
Make it our home.

22:02.447 --> 22:05.581
Your mother used to tell me,

22:05.583 --> 22:09.921
never go someplace that you
don't know your way out.

22:11.123 --> 22:14.426
I don't know my way
out with you, Boone.

22:15.827 --> 22:18.396
Who says you've got to leave?

22:21.066 --> 22:22.065
I do.

23:36.074 --> 23:39.409
You got that money you owe me?

23:39.411 --> 23:40.243
Money?

23:40.245 --> 23:41.979
What money?

23:42.013 --> 23:43.715
I already paid Patty.

23:45.183 --> 23:47.583
What the fuck are
you talking about?

23:47.585 --> 23:48.718
I promise you, sir.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.054
I am squared up.

23:50.922 --> 23:52.157
I can show you.

23:57.895 --> 24:01.731
What the fuck do you
mean you already paid Pat?

24:01.733 --> 24:05.170
He sent somebody
over to my house last night.

24:07.872 --> 24:08.706
Okay?

24:10.542 --> 24:12.175
What do you mean
one of his guys?

24:12.177 --> 24:13.010
What the fuck are
you talking about?

24:13.044 --> 24:14.777
I'm his guy.

24:14.779 --> 24:15.611
Another guy.

24:15.613 --> 24:17.280
You all look alike.

24:23.054 --> 24:25.921
If I find out you're
lying, I'm going to come back

24:25.923 --> 24:27.759
and cut your dick off.

24:33.598 --> 24:34.866
Jesus Christ.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.271
What the fuck, Pat?

24:39.304 --> 24:40.905
You told me to wait two more
days and you get another guy

24:40.938 --> 24:41.904
to cash in my job?

24:41.906 --> 24:42.738
Relax.

24:42.740 --> 24:43.573
Relax?

24:43.575 --> 24:44.474
That job was my mine.

24:44.476 --> 24:45.608
I need that fucking money.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.712
I said, relax.

24:47.745 --> 24:49.947
Give us a minute, will you?

25:03.828 --> 25:05.763
Who the fuck is that?

25:06.831 --> 25:08.166
That's my son.

25:09.967 --> 25:10.902
Your son?

25:11.769 --> 25:13.002
Yeah.

25:13.004 --> 25:14.406
Now I can explain
everything, okay?

25:14.439 --> 25:15.905
Are you calm?

25:15.907 --> 25:18.241
Can you hold your fucking
horses for a minute?

25:18.243 --> 25:20.111
And sit down?

25:20.144 --> 25:21.479
I said sit down!

25:23.315 --> 25:25.748
What I said was for you to
take a couple of days off,

25:25.750 --> 25:28.150
come back, and
that we would talk.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.985
I had Codi take
care of Mr. Finger.

25:29.987 --> 25:32.123
You'll split the cut with him.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.923
It's only fair.

25:33.925 --> 25:35.760
He's fresh out of Huntsville.

25:35.793 --> 25:37.593
He still needs some work,

25:37.595 --> 25:40.930
but to the potter
goes the clay, okay?

25:40.932 --> 25:42.365
Besides, I think
I know something

25:42.367 --> 25:45.203
that will make everybody happy.

25:45.270 --> 25:47.171
I was out after this.

25:48.473 --> 25:49.641
You knew that.

25:50.642 --> 25:52.041
I heard you, yes.

25:52.043 --> 25:56.147
But I don't dig for
water under the outhouse.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.380
Let me ask you something.

25:57.382 --> 25:59.715
Every time you got
up on that bull,

25:59.717 --> 26:02.720
did you think to
yourself, this is it.

26:02.787 --> 26:03.955
One last ride?

26:06.458 --> 26:08.123
The smart money says no.

26:08.125 --> 26:10.960
So there's some reason
why you want out

26:10.962 --> 26:14.797
so bad, and I want
to know what that is.

26:14.799 --> 26:16.468
My mother is sick.

26:18.736 --> 26:21.306
And the bank is after the land.

26:22.707 --> 26:24.173
The money I was making here

26:24.175 --> 26:27.044
is going to get us
out of all that.

26:28.513 --> 26:29.545
Goddamn it, Pat, that's
the reason I came to work

26:29.547 --> 26:31.816
for you in the first place.

26:33.685 --> 26:34.750
I see.

26:47.098 --> 26:49.098
I want you to work with Codi.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.733
One job, show him the ropes

26:50.735 --> 26:54.171
and when he's in a good place
you'll get all your money

26:54.205 --> 26:56.171
and then you can do
whatever the fuck you it is

26:56.173 --> 26:57.008
you want to do.

26:57.041 --> 26:58.209
We got a deal?

27:01.245 --> 27:03.245
I'm not a
goddamned babysitter.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.516
No.

27:04.549 --> 27:06.050
But you're going to find
out that letting the cat

27:06.083 --> 27:08.083
out of the bag is a whole
lot easier than trying

27:08.085 --> 27:09.621
to put him back in.

27:15.460 --> 27:17.126
All right.

27:17.128 --> 27:18.029
Good.

27:18.062 --> 27:19.431
I'll be in touch.

27:28.272 --> 27:29.106
Fucker.

27:36.948 --> 27:37.782
What?

27:42.286 --> 27:43.888
Hold on, slow down.

27:44.989 --> 27:46.622
All right.

27:46.624 --> 27:48.292
I'll be right there.

27:49.661 --> 27:51.162
What the hell happened, Billy?

27:51.228 --> 27:52.795
You said I had until Friday!

27:52.797 --> 27:54.129
Just calm down!

27:54.131 --> 27:55.132
Calm down?

27:56.934 --> 27:57.767
Damn it!

27:57.769 --> 27:58.734
A third party came in.

27:58.736 --> 28:00.235
That's really all I can say?

28:00.237 --> 28:01.072
That's all you can say?

28:01.105 --> 28:01.906
Bullshit!

28:04.642 --> 28:05.843
Are you done?

28:13.651 --> 28:15.820
So what happens now?

28:15.853 --> 28:16.688
Can I...

28:17.955 --> 28:19.088
An appeal process?

28:19.090 --> 28:19.924
Anything?

28:21.826 --> 28:22.660
No, Boone.

28:22.694 --> 28:23.928
I'm sorry.

28:23.961 --> 28:25.294
But like I said on the
phone, the house belongs

28:25.296 --> 28:26.964
to someone else now.

28:30.668 --> 28:32.470
You ain't going to tell me?

28:32.504 --> 28:36.874
I want to, I do, but I
can't lose my job over this.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.980
Is there any way
I can make a bid?

28:44.982 --> 28:47.116
Honestly, I don't know.

28:47.118 --> 28:51.122
That would be between you
and the new landowner.

28:53.625 --> 28:55.793
Sorry about your office.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.234
We lost the house today.

29:41.606 --> 29:43.174
It is what it is.

29:50.247 --> 29:51.916
That's it?

29:53.117 --> 29:56.120
That's all you have
to say about it?

29:58.956 --> 30:00.357
If there wasn't
something wrong

30:00.391 --> 30:02.393
there wouldn't be
anything right.

30:13.037 --> 30:15.707
Dad worked hard for this land.

30:19.110 --> 30:21.445
This house is all we've got.

30:27.619 --> 30:32.488
The only thing I got left
to maybe give to my kids

30:32.490 --> 30:33.591
when I'm old.

30:39.096 --> 30:43.801
I never thought for you to
be the having children type.

30:48.439 --> 30:49.807
What type am I?

30:55.312 --> 30:57.114
The rodeo type.

30:57.148 --> 30:59.148
Same as your dad.

30:59.150 --> 30:59.951
Drinking.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.021
Womanizing.

31:05.322 --> 31:09.026
He'd come home only one
or two nights a week.

31:12.329 --> 31:15.199
Who taught you to
throw a football?

31:15.266 --> 31:16.768
Me.

31:16.801 --> 31:19.201
Who took you to all your
roping competitions?

31:19.203 --> 31:20.538
Me.

31:20.605 --> 31:22.506
I paid those gate fees.

31:23.608 --> 31:24.441
Not him.

31:25.843 --> 31:28.277
He was off in Arizona
somewhere, maybe locked up

31:28.279 --> 31:29.679
for all I know.

31:29.681 --> 31:31.282
Same as your uncle.

31:35.019 --> 31:39.722
You cowboys, hanging on to
this lifestyle likes it's,

31:39.724 --> 31:42.059
like it's a goddamn disease!

31:45.396 --> 31:48.332
God forbid you
should have children.

32:02.046 --> 32:04.046
I'm going to find out
who bought the house.

32:04.048 --> 32:05.883
Make an offer.

32:05.917 --> 32:07.883
With what money?

32:07.885 --> 32:09.721
I've got some saved.

32:13.658 --> 32:17.593
You could sell that horse
of yours you never see.

32:17.595 --> 32:19.931
I ain't selling the horse.

32:22.533 --> 32:23.367
Well.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.574
Your Uncle Kyle's
not in the will.

32:36.213 --> 32:40.115
I figured, figured you should
be the one to tell him.

32:47.091 --> 32:47.923
Morning.

32:47.925 --> 32:48.860
Morning.

32:48.893 --> 32:49.894
Who are you here to see?

32:49.927 --> 32:50.760
Kyle Carson.

32:50.762 --> 32:51.894
All right.

32:51.896 --> 32:54.732
May I see your
identification, please?

32:56.801 --> 32:57.601
Thank you.

33:17.922 --> 33:20.091
You've got five minutes.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.236
Nice pajamas.

33:34.138 --> 33:35.239
Thanks, man.

33:35.272 --> 33:36.941
I miss my Lucchese's, though.

33:36.974 --> 33:38.142
Yeah, I bet.

33:39.176 --> 33:39.911
How are they treating
you in there?

33:39.944 --> 33:40.778
All right?

33:42.747 --> 33:43.580
Not bad.

33:44.615 --> 33:46.617
I'm up for parole in a month.

33:46.650 --> 33:47.482
No shit.

33:47.484 --> 33:48.317
Already?

33:48.319 --> 33:49.153
Yeah.

33:50.254 --> 33:52.321
It doesn't look good though.

33:52.323 --> 33:54.425
Why not?

33:54.458 --> 33:56.425
Fucking Mexicans.

33:56.427 --> 33:58.863
Always trying to act all hard.

34:00.031 --> 34:01.265
Let them fight
the skinheads, man.

34:01.298 --> 34:02.464
Stay out of that shit.

34:02.466 --> 34:03.966
I don't know.

34:03.968 --> 34:06.135
It's just something I've
got to do on my own, man.

34:06.137 --> 34:07.703
You don't forget all that shit.

34:07.705 --> 34:09.538
What's new with you?

34:09.540 --> 34:11.005
Same old.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.110
You back on a bull yet?

34:14.344 --> 34:16.178
Not anymore.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.380
A guy in here said a
rodeo came through town,

34:18.382 --> 34:20.317
said you weren't in it.

34:22.619 --> 34:24.956
You working for Pat now?

34:24.989 --> 34:25.822
Yeah.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.358
Does my sister know?

34:29.360 --> 34:30.692
Fuck no.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.396
Do I look stupid to you?

34:32.463 --> 34:34.563
Yeah, kind of.

34:34.565 --> 34:37.068
Working for Pat when you
could be out there on tour.

34:37.134 --> 34:40.135
I couldn't walk for
seven months, Kyle.

34:40.137 --> 34:42.639
I didn't know what else to do.

34:44.408 --> 34:45.407
All right, man.

34:45.409 --> 34:46.510
I'm sorry.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.045
How is she anyway?

34:50.214 --> 34:51.547
Not good, man.

34:54.685 --> 34:59.390
Oh, coughing up blood and, I
went and saw her doctor and,

35:02.426 --> 35:03.694
he said best case scenario,

35:03.727 --> 35:06.430
she lives another
couple of months.

35:07.664 --> 35:10.001
Listen, I've got to
tell you something.

35:10.034 --> 35:11.702
What is it?

35:15.106 --> 35:17.708
She left you out of the will.

35:25.616 --> 35:27.116
She said that?

35:27.118 --> 35:29.284
She don't mean nothing by it.

35:29.286 --> 35:30.287
Fuck that!

35:32.223 --> 35:33.122
Fuck that!

35:33.124 --> 35:35.692
She never given a shit about me.

35:36.593 --> 35:37.962
Don't say that.

35:39.964 --> 35:41.398
The only reason
I'm telling you is

35:41.432 --> 35:45.801
just in case something happens
to me, you need to know.

35:45.803 --> 35:47.038
You got heat?

35:48.039 --> 35:49.471
I don't know.

35:49.473 --> 35:50.541
You fucking know
if you've got heat

35:50.574 --> 35:53.308
or if you don't got heat.

35:53.310 --> 35:55.945
Pat's got me in on
something with a new guy.

35:55.947 --> 35:56.778
Codi.

35:56.780 --> 35:57.882
His son.

35:57.915 --> 35:59.416
I don't trust him.

36:00.651 --> 36:01.817
Listen to me.

36:01.819 --> 36:03.888
You still got that horse?

36:05.823 --> 36:07.823
The fastest way to double your
money is you fold it in half

36:07.825 --> 36:10.227
and put it in your pocket.

36:10.261 --> 36:11.495
You hearing me?

36:15.066 --> 36:17.466
Look, I don't want to
be asking permission

36:17.468 --> 36:19.403
to come to your funeral.

36:19.436 --> 36:21.438
You are all I have left.

36:22.439 --> 36:24.339
What about what I said?

36:24.341 --> 36:25.576
About the will?

36:31.315 --> 36:32.183
Fuck her.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.484
I'll be seeing you.

36:38.022 --> 36:38.856
Guard.

36:39.957 --> 36:40.791
Guard!

36:44.428 --> 36:46.497
Get the fuck out of here.

37:34.178 --> 37:36.178
What the fuck
are you doing here?

37:36.180 --> 37:38.015
You been following me?

37:45.356 --> 37:47.356
The old man came through.

37:47.358 --> 37:49.593
Wants you to take me along.

37:56.233 --> 37:57.668
Where were you before prison?

37:57.701 --> 37:58.533
El Paso.

37:58.535 --> 37:59.368
Why?

37:59.370 --> 38:01.736
Who'd you work for?

38:01.738 --> 38:03.574
Guy named Ramirez.

38:03.607 --> 38:05.509
Ramirez from El Paso.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.412
A hotshot like your dad?

38:09.947 --> 38:11.215
Yeah, more or less.

38:11.248 --> 38:12.849
Which one was it?

38:19.690 --> 38:21.058
Does it matter?

38:21.925 --> 38:22.926
Guess not.

38:24.695 --> 38:25.862
I'm going to clean up.

38:25.896 --> 38:27.564
Take a shower.

38:27.598 --> 38:30.765
Well how long is
that going to take?

38:30.767 --> 38:33.035
Well I ain't in a rush, slick.

38:33.037 --> 38:34.871
Cold beer in the fridge.

38:34.905 --> 38:36.240
Fucking asshole.

39:07.404 --> 39:09.971
How the hell are you Pat's kid?

39:09.973 --> 39:13.644
It's safe to say you
don't look anything alike.

39:13.677 --> 39:17.012
You know, there's more
to family than blood.

39:17.014 --> 39:18.582
Is it true you own
a $100,000 horse

39:18.615 --> 39:21.452
that you won't
sell it to anybody?

39:22.953 --> 39:23.785
Hey.

39:23.787 --> 39:24.819
You see that?

39:24.821 --> 39:25.654
Right there.

39:25.656 --> 39:26.923
That door.

39:26.957 --> 39:28.157
Yeah.

39:28.159 --> 39:30.361
That's what we
call a dead drop.

39:30.427 --> 39:31.493
It's like a secret location

39:31.495 --> 39:32.863
when people pass
packages, money-

39:32.929 --> 39:36.300
- I know what the
hell a dead drop is.

39:36.333 --> 39:37.632
All right, smartass.

39:37.634 --> 39:39.134
Go check it out.

39:39.136 --> 39:41.972
There should be a
package for you.

39:43.607 --> 39:47.111
Hey, it's how we do
things in North Texas.

40:45.202 --> 40:46.337
What happened?

40:47.404 --> 40:48.372
No answer.

40:50.441 --> 40:51.408
No answer?

40:52.709 --> 40:53.510
You sure?

40:54.745 --> 40:58.247
What the fuck do you
think no answer means?

40:58.249 --> 40:59.049
Shit.

41:03.687 --> 41:05.420
What's that for?

41:05.422 --> 41:07.691
Self preservation.

41:07.724 --> 41:08.557
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:08.559 --> 41:09.758
There he is.

41:11.962 --> 41:13.094
There's the door.

41:13.096 --> 41:13.930
Go get it.

41:14.765 --> 41:15.599
Easy now.

41:27.911 --> 41:29.744
Who the fuck are you?

41:29.746 --> 41:30.579
It doesn't matter.

41:30.581 --> 41:31.746
Come on, let me have it.

41:31.748 --> 41:32.914
Where Boone at?

41:32.916 --> 41:35.150
He's in the truck.

41:35.152 --> 41:37.388
You must be the new guy?

41:37.421 --> 41:38.253
Yeah.

41:38.255 --> 41:39.923
Something like that.

41:39.956 --> 41:40.791
Come on.

42:00.444 --> 42:01.178
Shit!

42:03.113 --> 42:03.947
Fuck.

42:17.861 --> 42:18.862
Put it down!

42:21.164 --> 42:22.165
You first.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.370
We're on the same
goddamn team here, man.

42:26.437 --> 42:30.674
Then it shouldn't be hard
for you to put it away.

42:36.380 --> 42:40.784
What the hell did you
shoot him for, Codi?

42:40.817 --> 42:42.116
I've know this guy five years,

42:42.118 --> 42:44.288
he wouldn't do a
goddamned thing.

42:44.321 --> 42:46.555
I'm just doing
exactly how I was told.

42:46.557 --> 42:49.125
You were told to
listen to me, goddamn it!

42:49.159 --> 42:51.226
Look, if you've got a
problem take it up with pops.

42:51.228 --> 42:52.861
He's the one that
gives me orders.

42:52.863 --> 42:53.664
Not you.

43:08.812 --> 43:10.645
Yeah, that's going to be good.

43:13.417 --> 43:16.353
I'm going to have
to call you back.

43:17.854 --> 43:19.220
You look upset.

43:19.222 --> 43:20.891
Fucking right.

43:20.924 --> 43:23.827
Codi killed that
man in cold blood.

43:23.860 --> 43:27.195
He knew about the drop
and he shot him anyway.

43:27.197 --> 43:30.064
Is there something
you're not telling me?

43:30.066 --> 43:33.036
I'm the one that gave
the order to shoot the guy.

43:33.069 --> 43:34.903
He was talking to the cops.

43:34.905 --> 43:36.607
He was trying to get protection.

43:36.673 --> 43:39.042
And you weren't going
to tell me about it?

43:39.075 --> 43:40.575
He pulled a fucking
gun on me, Pat.

43:40.577 --> 43:43.345
Hey, who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

43:43.347 --> 43:45.716
I don't have to
tell you jack shit.

43:45.749 --> 43:46.948
You work for me!

43:46.950 --> 43:50.585
Get that through your
thick fucking skull!

43:50.587 --> 43:53.290
Anything else you want?

43:53.357 --> 43:57.361
Tonight's cut puts
me where I need to be.

43:57.394 --> 43:58.527
I'm out.

43:58.529 --> 43:59.796
Is that right?

44:00.931 --> 44:03.233
I was always
loyal to you, Pat.

44:03.266 --> 44:05.099
I never broke that trust.

44:05.101 --> 44:07.971
Like that asshole
uncle of yours?

44:12.809 --> 44:15.412
Just let me have my
money and get out of here.

44:15.446 --> 44:17.379
You're not thinking
this through.

44:17.381 --> 44:20.281
You think I'm going to let
you just walk out of here?

44:20.283 --> 44:21.385
C'est la vie?

44:27.290 --> 44:28.957
What's this?

44:28.959 --> 44:30.792
That's the deed to
your mother's land.

44:30.794 --> 44:32.963
I bought it from the bank.

44:36.833 --> 44:38.800
You bought it from the bank?

44:38.802 --> 44:40.337
That's right.

44:40.404 --> 44:44.839
Now, I don't have any use for
it, that's not why I did it.

44:44.841 --> 44:46.943
I did it to prove my point.

44:46.977 --> 44:48.443
You're only out of this business

44:48.445 --> 44:52.080
when I tell you that I have
no further use for you.

44:52.082 --> 44:54.785
Right now, I'm telling
you that I ain't done

44:54.818 --> 44:56.653
with your redneck ass.

44:57.588 --> 44:58.922
I'll kill you.

45:01.091 --> 45:02.359
No, you won't.

45:03.994 --> 45:08.997
You'll try, but see you're
not thinking this through.

45:08.999 --> 45:11.435
You're not thinking
about your sick mother

45:11.468 --> 45:13.804
and what will happen to her.

45:14.871 --> 45:17.874
Or that black
girlfriend of yours.

45:17.941 --> 45:21.778
Not to mention that
low-life, scum sucking,

45:21.812 --> 45:23.814
fuckhead uncle of yours.

45:26.116 --> 45:27.616
What?

45:27.618 --> 45:29.384
You think that I
can't slit his throat

45:29.386 --> 45:31.388
from behind this desk.

45:31.455 --> 45:36.192
I make one call, they're
delivering you an American flag.

45:39.295 --> 45:41.863
What do you want, Pat?

45:41.865 --> 45:43.299
I want a horse.

45:44.501 --> 45:46.200
Not your horse.

45:46.202 --> 45:47.536
A roping horse.

45:47.538 --> 45:48.539
Two of them.

45:49.840 --> 45:52.974
There's a rodeo in
Childress in two days.

45:52.976 --> 45:55.910
Your old boss is entering
two of his finest.

45:55.912 --> 45:59.047
I want you to steal
me those horses.

45:59.049 --> 46:01.652
How do you want me to do that?

46:03.219 --> 46:05.720
Set a cartwheel
up outside of town.

46:05.722 --> 46:07.090
No chance.

46:07.157 --> 46:08.725
Those boys know me.

46:10.160 --> 46:14.197
Everyone that you love,
everyone that you call family

46:14.230 --> 46:17.499
will die if you
don't do this for me!

46:17.501 --> 46:19.870
Is that clear enough for you?

46:21.738 --> 46:26.710
I do this, you hand over
that deed to the house.

46:26.743 --> 46:27.744
That's mine.

46:28.845 --> 46:32.180
And my family ain't
to be touched.

46:32.182 --> 46:35.552
Well it can't hurt
your chances, kiddo.

46:36.920 --> 46:39.921
I'll give you until tomorrow
to give me an answer.

46:39.923 --> 46:43.393
But if you don't show,
I'll show you what it means

46:43.426 --> 46:46.029
to drive black cattle at night.

47:12.489 --> 47:15.391
I found out who
bought the house.

47:20.964 --> 47:25.969
Now I've got to make a choice
between doing something awful

47:26.670 --> 47:27.838
or something worse.

47:33.409 --> 47:37.614
Palmer always got me out of
trouble when I was a kid.

47:37.648 --> 47:41.251
Uncle Kyle was always
running from the law.

47:42.786 --> 47:44.821
And you were always sick.

47:46.990 --> 47:50.825
But you all got me through
those years after dad left.

47:50.827 --> 47:53.530
I ain't never
going to forget it.

47:56.332 --> 47:58.334
But now, I need someone.

47:59.670 --> 48:00.871
I need someone.

48:04.007 --> 48:06.509
I never asked you why he left.

48:09.012 --> 48:11.447
You always blamed uncle Kyle.

48:13.516 --> 48:16.119
But deep down I knew it was me.

48:19.690 --> 48:21.522
And I hate myself for it.

48:26.630 --> 48:29.800
I wish that bull
would have killed me.

48:33.670 --> 48:38.239
Kept me going, knowing that
some day that big boy was going

48:38.241 --> 48:40.310
to put me where I belong.

48:42.713 --> 48:44.915
Underneath that arena dirt.

48:46.650 --> 48:48.351
Always so dramatic.

48:52.656 --> 48:55.325
That's what you think this is?

48:59.229 --> 49:03.399
Your father, before he
left, did one thing right.

49:06.569 --> 49:07.738
What's that?

49:09.873 --> 49:12.275
Talk slow, and think quick.

49:57.921 --> 50:00.388
You need something
with a little more kick?

50:00.390 --> 50:01.958
Why the hell not?

50:04.661 --> 50:07.731
Because I know
how you cowboys get.

50:10.834 --> 50:11.768
Here you go.

50:11.802 --> 50:12.635
Try that.

50:16.472 --> 50:18.074
Well, well, well.

50:19.309 --> 50:21.344
Boone "Lightning" Carson.

50:23.279 --> 50:26.480
Or is it just Boone now, huh?

50:26.482 --> 50:29.019
What do you say, Tip?

50:29.085 --> 50:32.520
Well it's been
a long time, huh?

50:32.522 --> 50:35.156
Last I seen you they
was carting your carcass

50:35.158 --> 50:38.661
off the Abilene Arena
on a stretcher, huh?

50:39.662 --> 50:42.463
What are you doing back home?

50:42.465 --> 50:44.267
I never really left.

50:45.435 --> 50:47.335
You see, that's why
they call it a circuit.

50:47.337 --> 50:49.503
Because eventually it ends.

50:49.505 --> 50:52.843
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

50:52.876 --> 50:57.180
Well, I do know your old
boss wants to sponsor me.

51:00.717 --> 51:02.452
Good for him.

51:02.485 --> 51:03.486
Very good.

51:05.655 --> 51:07.521
Say, the least I can
do is buy you a drink.

51:07.523 --> 51:08.624
Huh?

51:08.658 --> 51:10.693
Taking your spot and all.

51:12.896 --> 51:14.064
Not tonight.

51:16.166 --> 51:17.333
What's that?

51:19.502 --> 51:21.204
I said not tonight.

51:22.138 --> 51:23.571
Hey, guys.

51:23.573 --> 51:24.240
If you two want to beat
the hell out of each other,

51:24.307 --> 51:25.641
take it outside.

51:28.178 --> 51:30.879
I'm going to take a piss.

51:30.881 --> 51:32.482
Good to see you, Tip.

51:32.515 --> 51:36.186
Too scared to get
back on the bull.

51:36.219 --> 51:40.090
And too proud to pass
the torch to someone new.

51:41.257 --> 51:43.224
Say that again.

51:43.226 --> 51:44.828
I said you're too scared-

51:44.861 --> 51:45.695
- Oh!

51:45.728 --> 51:47.061
You chickenshit!

51:47.063 --> 51:48.429
Oh!

51:49.732 --> 51:50.698
Come on, Boone.

51:50.700 --> 51:53.236
She told you to take it outside.

51:56.739 --> 51:58.374
Oh my God, napkin.

51:59.242 --> 52:00.074
Shit.

52:00.076 --> 52:01.244
I've had worse.

52:08.751 --> 52:10.451
Lightning.

52:10.453 --> 52:11.287
Lightning.

52:14.757 --> 52:15.957
So what the hell, man?

52:15.959 --> 52:18.592
You don't answer
you phone no more?

52:18.594 --> 52:21.429
Your mama's been
calling for you.

52:21.431 --> 52:25.301
The bartender even called
me to come pick you up.

52:25.368 --> 52:28.102
It sounds like you
closed this place down.

52:28.104 --> 52:29.270
Literally.

52:29.272 --> 52:30.773
What time is it?

52:32.642 --> 52:34.475
Time to get your ass home.

52:34.477 --> 52:36.811
I got square hay to put
out and a pasture to clear.

52:36.813 --> 52:37.645
Come on.

52:37.647 --> 52:38.982
Goddamn right.

53:17.487 --> 53:19.122
You got money for a
cab to come back later

53:19.155 --> 53:20.690
and get your truck?

53:21.624 --> 53:22.857
Hmmm.

53:22.859 --> 53:23.693
Lost it.

53:24.995 --> 53:25.994
You lost it.

53:25.996 --> 53:26.827
Hmm.

53:26.829 --> 53:27.663
Goddamn.

53:49.519 --> 53:52.956
Boone, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

53:56.859 --> 54:01.797
Do you know how much those boys
at the ranch look up to you?

54:03.299 --> 54:04.834
Goddamn, there ain't one day
that goes by that one of us

54:04.867 --> 54:07.535
ain't telling a Boone
Carson story or laughing

54:07.537 --> 54:09.537
about one of the many
times you came over just

54:09.539 --> 54:11.207
to give Palmer hell.

54:14.577 --> 54:19.149
If they saw you like
this, it would crush them.

54:19.182 --> 54:20.982
Erase every good
memory they ever had

54:20.984 --> 54:23.319
of Boone 'Lightning' Carson.

54:25.388 --> 54:27.688
That ain't me no more.

54:27.690 --> 54:29.725
That ain't you no more.

54:31.394 --> 54:33.727
Well they don't
need to know that.

54:33.729 --> 54:36.899
And I sure as hell
don't believe that.

54:41.904 --> 54:42.838
Change that shirt.

54:42.872 --> 54:45.075
You smell like a distillery.

55:18.441 --> 55:19.275
Get up.

55:24.480 --> 55:25.481
Hey.

55:25.548 --> 55:27.550
Good morning.

55:30.253 --> 55:31.552
You got my message?

55:31.554 --> 55:32.386
Yeah.

55:32.388 --> 55:33.387
I was asleep.

55:33.389 --> 55:34.888
It was three in the morning.

55:34.890 --> 55:36.226
What's going on?

55:38.461 --> 55:43.166
That day you always talked
about that would come.

55:43.233 --> 55:44.067
It's here.

55:45.001 --> 55:46.502
Are you stupid?

55:46.569 --> 55:48.738
I told you not to get
caught up with that guy.

55:48.771 --> 55:51.472
You've got to stick around to
help take care your mother.

55:51.474 --> 55:55.745
Which is exactly why I'm
going through with this.

55:59.749 --> 56:02.650
You know I worry
when you get like this.

56:02.652 --> 56:03.986
I'm just trying to
do the right thing.

56:04.020 --> 56:04.920
Not that.

56:05.821 --> 56:06.954
The drinking.

56:06.956 --> 56:08.089
The decisions.

56:08.091 --> 56:10.593
Hasn't your mother had enough?

56:12.162 --> 56:15.529
I was never good
to you, Brenda.

56:15.531 --> 56:16.799
Everybody knows that.

56:20.836 --> 56:24.174
But I got to ask you
for one last thing.

56:27.510 --> 56:28.878
Stay with mother.

56:31.147 --> 56:34.448
In case something
bad happens to me.

56:34.450 --> 56:35.485
Of course.

56:35.518 --> 56:38.188
I'd do anything for your mother.

56:41.524 --> 56:43.193
I appreciate that.

56:49.865 --> 56:52.202
I'll be back when it's over.

56:54.737 --> 56:55.971
I'm pregnant.

57:06.048 --> 57:07.483
Say that again.

57:08.751 --> 57:11.254
You're going to be a father.

57:27.837 --> 57:29.172
July is 13.95.

57:32.575 --> 57:33.907
I'll do it.

57:33.909 --> 57:36.446
But it's a two-man job.

57:36.512 --> 57:37.911
Codi's your man.

57:37.913 --> 57:39.449
Not him.

57:39.515 --> 57:40.614
I need somebody
who knows horses.

57:40.616 --> 57:42.082
Someone I can trust.

57:42.084 --> 57:43.219
No offense.

57:43.253 --> 57:44.084
Go fuck yourself.

57:44.086 --> 57:44.954
Yeah, you too.

57:45.020 --> 57:45.919
Okay.

57:45.921 --> 57:48.258
Someone that you can trust.

57:48.291 --> 57:49.792
Codi's still going
to be there watching

57:49.859 --> 57:52.960
the job the whole time, just
in case you try to get cute.

57:52.962 --> 57:54.464
It's got to be soon.

57:54.530 --> 57:55.963
These boys head out early.

57:55.965 --> 57:57.032
There's a place right
along the way that's going

57:57.066 --> 57:58.566
to be perfect for this.

57:58.568 --> 57:59.402
And?

58:00.703 --> 58:03.304
We could run into some issues.

58:03.306 --> 58:05.575
These guys carry guns and
they're not shy about using them.

58:05.608 --> 58:07.641
That's why Codi's going
to be there watching.

58:07.643 --> 58:09.078
They can't even
know he's around.

58:09.111 --> 58:11.612
They sniff someone is on
their ass this thing is over.

58:11.614 --> 58:13.113
All right?

58:13.115 --> 58:14.648
These cowboys treat their
prize horses like gold.

58:14.650 --> 58:16.919
They'd rather die
than see them stolen.

58:16.952 --> 58:18.053
Just do it!

58:19.989 --> 58:21.924
And one more thing.

58:21.957 --> 58:26.126
When this is done and you try
and fuck me, I'm going to walk

58:26.128 --> 58:29.265
in here and I'm going to
put a bullet in your head.

58:29.299 --> 58:31.465
You, too, Ponytail.

58:31.467 --> 58:32.900
All right?

58:35.471 --> 58:37.006
You've got my word.

58:39.609 --> 58:40.510
Giddy-up.

58:46.449 --> 58:47.748
Go.

58:47.750 --> 58:48.584
Go.

58:55.958 --> 58:56.959
Play nice.

59:13.676 --> 59:15.476
What the hell are
you doing here, Brenda?

59:15.478 --> 59:16.544
It's your nephew.

59:16.546 --> 59:18.948
I think he's in trouble.

59:18.981 --> 59:21.114
Not a lot I can do
from in here is there?

59:21.116 --> 59:22.716
That's why I
need you to make parole.

59:22.718 --> 59:24.454
I need you to get out.

59:24.487 --> 59:25.686
It's not that easy.

59:25.688 --> 59:27.187
It can be.

59:27.189 --> 59:31.160
Boone, he's about to do
something and, it's just,

59:32.628 --> 59:34.528
we won't make it far if
something happens to him.

59:34.530 --> 59:36.031
And you know that.

59:38.968 --> 59:41.034
I'll see what I can do.

59:41.036 --> 59:43.906
Well, you're going to have
to because it ain't just him

59:43.973 --> 59:45.174
and me anymore.

59:53.883 --> 59:55.551
We're having a baby.

59:57.553 --> 59:58.888
You and Boone?

59:59.889 --> 01:00:00.723
Yeah.

01:00:02.825 --> 01:00:04.660
I can't do this alone.

01:00:04.694 --> 01:00:05.528
Please.

01:00:23.112 --> 01:00:24.547
Do you ever get the
feeling that none of this

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:26.582
means a goddamned thing?

01:00:29.619 --> 01:00:31.621
That none of it matters?

01:00:34.056 --> 01:00:36.726
Where I'm from, where I'm going.

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:41.263
All this shit and
mess we leave behind.

01:00:46.302 --> 01:00:49.204
I just don't fucking
understand it.

01:00:57.613 --> 01:00:59.780
You know, when
you figure that shit out,

01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:01.451
you'll be good to go.

01:01:45.595 --> 01:01:47.361
Driver!

01:01:47.363 --> 01:01:48.328
Put your hands up!

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:49.997
Throw the keys out the window!

01:01:49.999 --> 01:01:50.866
Not today.

01:01:52.602 --> 01:01:55.268
Now get
out real easy like.

01:01:56.105 --> 01:01:57.640
Get out!

01:01:57.673 --> 01:02:01.208
Keep those hands
where I can see them!

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:02.344
Shut the door.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.181
Come on, motherfucker.

01:02:06.215 --> 01:02:07.180
Get over here.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:08.183
Don't fuck around.

01:02:08.217 --> 01:02:09.049
Turn him around front.

01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:10.350
Get him on his knees.

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:11.286
- Get him on his knees.
- Let's go.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.489
Trailer, trailer.

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:16.023
Come on.

01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:16.857
Get to the door.

01:02:16.859 --> 01:02:18.193
Open it.

01:02:18.227 --> 01:02:19.359
You sure you
about that, partner?

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.530
Did I stutter?

01:02:20.563 --> 01:02:22.062
Open it.

01:02:22.064 --> 01:02:23.298
Howdy.

01:02:26.702 --> 01:02:30.039
Hey, what's
going on back there?

01:02:32.742 --> 01:02:33.676
Go, go, go!

01:02:58.601 --> 01:03:01.704
Put down the fucking phone.

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:02.938
I said drop it.

01:03:06.442 --> 01:03:09.445
We've got to get
the fuck out of here.

01:03:20.923 --> 01:03:22.191
Warden.

01:03:22.224 --> 01:03:23.292
On your feet.

01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:33.569
This ought to be
real quick and simple.

01:03:33.603 --> 01:03:36.570
You give me one good
reason why I should even

01:03:36.572 --> 01:03:39.873
let you sit down in front
of that parole board?

01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:41.642
Always in the whites.

01:03:41.644 --> 01:03:42.478
Solitary.

01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:46.947
You know, you straighten
up and we might

01:03:46.949 --> 01:03:49.617
just could move you to post.

01:03:49.619 --> 01:03:53.455
They got a goddamn
tropical smoothie in there.

01:03:54.624 --> 01:03:55.457
So?

01:03:59.629 --> 01:04:01.463
I'm ready to go home.

01:04:05.267 --> 01:04:06.101
I'm ready.

01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:36.131
Get off me.

01:04:40.836 --> 01:04:41.937
What is this?

01:04:43.806 --> 01:04:45.641
What the fuck is this?

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:49.643
Pops going to hit
the fucking roof

01:04:49.645 --> 01:04:52.780
when he finds out what happened.

01:04:52.782 --> 01:04:53.616
Ah, I see.

01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:56.185
You set this up?

01:04:57.653 --> 01:05:00.823
Do you really think you're
going to get away with it?

01:05:00.856 --> 01:05:03.056
Not if you're around
to tell anyone about it.

01:05:03.058 --> 01:05:03.891
Okay.

01:05:04.894 --> 01:05:06.729
Look, I'll leave town.

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:10.065
I can disappear.

01:05:10.132 --> 01:05:12.501
You'll disappear.

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:14.067
Where do you think you're going
to go where Pat's not going

01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:15.070
to find you?

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:17.372
A rat?

01:05:18.708 --> 01:05:19.875
In the family?

01:05:21.711 --> 01:05:23.212
At what point do you think
he's going to stop looking

01:05:23.245 --> 01:05:25.648
for a piece of shit like you?

01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:30.720
You'll never see me again-

01:05:32.722 --> 01:05:34.757
- You're right.

01:05:34.824 --> 01:05:35.991
Okay wait, look.

01:05:42.832 --> 01:05:43.666
I knew it.

01:05:45.234 --> 01:05:47.336
I knew you didn't
have it in you.

01:05:47.369 --> 01:05:51.038
All right, can we quit
fucking around and untie me?

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:51.874
Come on.

01:05:56.078 --> 01:05:56.910
All right, what happens now.

01:05:56.912 --> 01:05:57.745
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:08.624
Now you all here know me.

01:06:10.259 --> 01:06:13.595
If any one of you all has a
problem with what happened here

01:06:13.629 --> 01:06:15.130
you can leave now.

01:06:16.298 --> 01:06:17.800
I ain't going to
hold any ill will.

01:06:17.867 --> 01:06:20.402
It's all good with us, Boone.

01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:22.571
Damn right.

01:06:23.773 --> 01:06:26.406
I owe you boys my life.

01:06:26.408 --> 01:06:29.309
You were here when I needed you.

01:06:29.311 --> 01:06:32.314
And I ain't ever
going to forget it.

01:06:34.049 --> 01:06:35.951
That's what cowboys do.

01:06:38.921 --> 01:06:40.487
Let's clean this
piece of shit up

01:06:40.489 --> 01:06:42.992
and then let's get some beers.

01:06:45.127 --> 01:06:46.461
Yes sir.

01:06:46.495 --> 01:06:47.997
- Sounds like a plan to us.
- Thanks, boys.

01:06:48.063 --> 01:06:49.464
Yes, sir.

01:06:57.272 --> 01:06:58.440
Pat.

01:06:58.473 --> 01:06:59.306
Easy!

01:06:59.308 --> 01:07:00.140
Easy!

01:07:00.142 --> 01:07:00.974
We're not armed!

01:07:00.976 --> 01:07:01.742
Where's Codi?

01:07:01.744 --> 01:07:02.843
Codi's gone.

01:07:02.845 --> 01:07:04.179
We came as fast as we could.

01:07:04.246 --> 01:07:05.245
Who the hell is this?

01:07:05.247 --> 01:07:07.180
Hey, he's with me, all right?

01:07:07.182 --> 01:07:09.084
Shit went south.

01:07:09.118 --> 01:07:10.619
They had the horses.

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:12.019
It was all Codi's fault.

01:07:12.021 --> 01:07:13.122
Is that right?

01:07:13.155 --> 01:07:14.421
He got greedy.

01:07:14.423 --> 01:07:16.091
Why in the hell
would he do that?

01:07:16.125 --> 01:07:17.624
The fuck if I know.

01:07:17.626 --> 01:07:20.293
But he's halfway
to El Paso by now.

01:07:20.295 --> 01:07:22.631
You're telling me that
Codi tipped off your guys?

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:25.132
He was either in on
it, or he spooked them.

01:07:25.134 --> 01:07:25.966
Okay?

01:07:25.968 --> 01:07:27.434
Think.

01:07:27.436 --> 01:07:29.271
Could he have called Ramirez
in on this one, or what?

01:07:29.304 --> 01:07:30.503
Ramirez?

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:32.174
How do you even know
that fucking name?

01:07:32.207 --> 01:07:33.709
Is it possible?

01:07:33.776 --> 01:07:34.609
Yes or no?

01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:37.711
Well where are the horses?

01:07:37.713 --> 01:07:39.114
I don't know.

01:07:39.148 --> 01:07:40.347
Perfect.

01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:43.552
Nobody knows where the
goddamn horses are?

01:07:47.489 --> 01:07:48.323
I do.

01:07:54.396 --> 01:07:55.230
Show me.

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:02.637
I see an empty horse arena.

01:08:02.671 --> 01:08:05.005
The old man said that
my horses would be here.

01:08:05.007 --> 01:08:06.842
Do you see any horses?

01:08:08.077 --> 01:08:09.411
They'll be here.

01:08:09.478 --> 01:08:10.978
When?

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:13.814
Do I look like the type of
guy that has time to waste?

01:08:13.816 --> 01:08:17.386
He says they'll be
here, they'll be here.

01:08:27.662 --> 01:08:28.895
Well?

01:08:28.898 --> 01:08:31.066
Where are the goddamned horses?

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:39.774
I told you.

01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:43.609
Go get my horses.

01:08:43.612 --> 01:08:46.948
I don't care how you
do it, just do it.

01:08:55.357 --> 01:08:56.423
Old Creepshow
wants the horses.

01:08:56.425 --> 01:08:58.426
What do you want to do?

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:00.462
That son of a bitch ain't
taking any of my mine.

01:09:00.529 --> 01:09:04.198
He ain't getting
them without a fight.

01:09:04.233 --> 01:09:06.734
He ain't getting mine.

01:09:14.076 --> 01:09:15.608
There's a problem.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:16.609
Problem?

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:17.880
What problem?

01:09:17.912 --> 01:09:19.645
They don't want
to give you shit.

01:09:19.648 --> 01:09:21.984
Do they know who I am?

01:09:22.051 --> 01:09:23.417
No.

01:09:23.452 --> 01:09:26.787
But it wouldn't matter
much if they did.

01:09:37.265 --> 01:09:38.600
You set me up.

01:09:40.402 --> 01:09:42.604
You set yourself up, Pat.

01:09:43.973 --> 01:09:45.740
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

01:09:45.774 --> 01:09:48.609
The only asshole in
Texas with a gun?

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:50.643
You're going to pay for this.

01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:51.845
All of you!

01:09:51.846 --> 01:09:54.416
You think you can humiliate me?

01:09:56.418 --> 01:09:59.754
This is how it's
going to work.

01:09:59.788 --> 01:10:01.288
You're going to
get in that truck

01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:04.357
and you're going to drive your
ass as far away as possible.

01:10:04.359 --> 01:10:07.529
If I wake up tomorrow and
hear you're hanging around,

01:10:07.596 --> 01:10:10.163
I'm going to kill you.

01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:11.266
You can explain to the buyers

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.635
why you don't have the horses,

01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:17.204
and why you're running with
your tail between your legs.

01:10:17.206 --> 01:10:18.040
Big man.

01:10:19.208 --> 01:10:20.042
Big man!

01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:22.777
Yeah.

01:10:22.811 --> 01:10:25.112
What about your mommy's land?

01:10:25.114 --> 01:10:25.946
Yeah.

01:10:25.948 --> 01:10:26.779
Right?

01:10:26.781 --> 01:10:28.115
I own it!

01:10:28.117 --> 01:10:30.485
Remember that, you stupid prick?

01:10:30.519 --> 01:10:31.853
I have the deed!

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:33.855
This deed?

01:10:38.793 --> 01:10:41.563
Sign it over to
me right now, Pat.

01:10:42.998 --> 01:10:44.799
It ain't a discussion.

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.580
This doesn't change anything.

01:11:00.582 --> 01:11:03.252
I'm going to come back and
I'm going to press you.

01:11:03.318 --> 01:11:04.651
All of you!

01:11:04.653 --> 01:11:05.487
Hard!

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:07.656
Unlikely.

01:11:10.359 --> 01:11:11.193
Try me.

01:11:17.332 --> 01:11:20.667
On the other hand, we can
tie the other end of that rope

01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:23.170
to one of these horses right
here and drag your creepy ass

01:11:23.172 --> 01:11:24.839
out of town with it.

01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:30.279
See how long it takes before
your limbs start tearing off.

01:11:30.345 --> 01:11:32.181
That's a promise, Pat.

01:11:36.385 --> 01:11:39.119
Say goodbye
to your uncle for me.

01:11:39.121 --> 01:11:40.555
Well we're all happy
to hear you say that,

01:11:40.589 --> 01:11:43.256
because the boys are
going to drag you anyway.

01:11:43.258 --> 01:11:45.094
Give him a ride, boys!

01:12:06.748 --> 01:12:07.580
All right.

01:12:07.582 --> 01:12:08.415
Everything looks good.

01:12:08.417 --> 01:12:10.319
You got a check for me?

01:12:17.592 --> 01:12:18.791
Okay.

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:20.295
I'll get this to the
loan officer downtown.

01:12:20.329 --> 01:12:22.795
Should have the new deed
processed in about two weeks.

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:23.999
Free and clear.

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.734
Thank you, Billy.

01:12:27.736 --> 01:12:29.604
No hard feelings, all right?

01:12:29.638 --> 01:12:31.004
Take care of yourself, Boone.

01:12:31.006 --> 01:12:31.840
You too.

01:12:40.482 --> 01:12:43.752
Looks like you got
your wish, Carson.

01:13:16.818 --> 01:13:20.822
So, darling, let me
get another one of these.

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:21.688
Here you go.

01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:22.691
Thank you.

01:13:29.498 --> 01:13:31.833
What the hell do you want?

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.200
I brought you a beer.

01:13:33.202 --> 01:13:34.403
Yeah.

01:13:34.469 --> 01:13:36.136
Feel like you need
to clean the bar

01:13:36.138 --> 01:13:39.308
with my face a little bit more?

01:13:39.341 --> 01:13:40.175
Look.

01:13:44.679 --> 01:13:46.579
Sorry for being an asshole.

01:13:46.581 --> 01:13:47.547
All right.

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:50.051
Give them hell on the circuit.

01:13:54.723 --> 01:13:55.557
Hey.

01:13:57.392 --> 01:14:00.662
I hear tell you're
going to be a daddy.

01:14:02.697 --> 01:14:03.532
Yep.

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:08.403
Hey, here's to what
the future brings.

01:14:17.045 --> 01:14:18.413
That bar is hard.

01:14:29.758 --> 01:14:32.925
I was hoping you were going
to be here when I got back.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:34.863
I made you a promise.

01:14:36.865 --> 01:14:37.899
How is she?

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:44.038
She's gone.

01:14:49.544 --> 01:14:50.712
Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:52.481 --> 01:14:53.548
Are you okay?

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:56.785
Yeah.

01:14:57.786 --> 01:14:58.787
Okay.

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:37.526
You two look good together-

01:15:39.361 --> 01:15:42.329
- Actually, I just
stopped by to say goodbye.

01:15:42.331 --> 01:15:43.164
Goodbye?

01:15:46.435 --> 01:15:47.836
He's all yours.

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:54.443
The way I see it, a horse
ain't meant to wait around.

01:15:55.544 --> 01:15:59.013
Especially on some
chickenshit bull rider.

01:15:59.948 --> 01:16:02.617
What do you want for him?

01:16:02.651 --> 01:16:03.485
Nothing.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.787
I know you'll do right by him.

01:16:07.789 --> 01:16:10.357
He deserves that much.

01:16:10.359 --> 01:16:12.727
You sure you don't need a job?

01:16:12.794 --> 01:16:14.496
What was that you always
said about asking a barber

01:16:14.529 --> 01:16:17.029
if you need a haircut?

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:19.133
Same answer every time.

01:16:24.539 --> 01:16:26.205
Take care, Palmer.

01:16:56.271 --> 01:16:57.506
Barkeep.

01:16:57.539 --> 01:16:58.373
Hit me.

01:17:04.045 --> 01:17:04.877
Oh.

01:17:06.515 --> 01:17:07.349
Cheers.

01:17:15.957 --> 01:17:17.626
That was a good one.

01:17:23.565 --> 01:17:25.698
Could I have
a beer, sweetheart?

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:26.535
Thank you.

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:29.804
Jesus Christ!

01:17:30.939 --> 01:17:33.239
Man, I told you I
wasn't lying about Pat.

01:17:33.241 --> 01:17:34.073
Relax.

01:17:34.075 --> 01:17:36.275
I ain't here about that.

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:38.780
Then what is it that you want?

01:17:38.813 --> 01:17:41.981
Listen, man, I'm here
to help, not hurt you.

01:17:41.983 --> 01:17:43.985
Take this card and call the guy.

01:17:44.052 --> 01:17:46.118
Get that finger sewed back on.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.622
- What?
- Take it.

01:17:48.923 --> 01:17:52.260
Mention my name, he'll
fix you right up.

01:17:57.632 --> 01:17:58.767
Thank you.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.800
There's something else.

01:18:00.802 --> 01:18:02.837
That security firm you work for,

01:18:02.904 --> 01:18:04.238
are they hiring?

01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:11.411
Are you asking me for a job?

01:18:11.413 --> 01:18:12.414
Yes or no?

01:18:14.248 --> 01:18:15.249
Well, I mean, I,

01:18:16.818 --> 01:18:19.986
I can put a good word
at the main office,

01:18:19.988 --> 01:18:23.155
but it's not the kind of
stuff you want to get into.

01:18:23.157 --> 01:18:23.992
Right?

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:26.192
Unless you've got
something bigger

01:18:26.194 --> 01:18:28.361
I can sink my teeth into.

01:18:51.653 --> 01:18:52.654
All right.

01:18:53.722 --> 01:18:55.490
How much do you know?

01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:59.358
I know about that
game in Oklahoma.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.195
I know you're involved.

01:19:02.464 --> 01:19:04.165
Ah, the poker game.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:08.236
Well, that's not
just a poker game.

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:14.543
See, down south from there,

01:19:15.877 --> 01:19:20.549
there's a fortune buried
underneath this old man's ranch.

01:19:24.586 --> 01:19:26.354
Yours for the taking.

01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:30.058
I can get you into.

01:19:32.494 --> 01:19:33.828
I'm listening.

01:19:38.066 --> 01:19:42.571
Well first, we're going
to have to change your name.

01:19:47.275 --> 01:19:48.510
Jessup Cross.

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.548
That's right.

01:19:56.217 --> 01:19:57.218
Hey, cheers.

01:19:59.187 --> 01:20:00.021
Cheers.

01:20:01.956 --> 01:20:03.289
What could go wrong?
