- Yes, you will.

You already have.

00:16.981 --> 00:20.983

a vaccine is nearly impossible.

everything we know

00:23.821 --> 00:25.287

stop an epidemic

front of all the right people.

00:41.235 --> 00:42.968

our little family group

Jesus, Eph. I mean, I knew
things were bad in NYC,

03:35.885 --> 03:37.818
this disease and what

03:37.820 --> 03:39.886
- Yeah, I mean, we've had some
incidents--but the military

03:39.888 --> 03:41.287
has deployed
massive resources.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.289
You know, they got
the city locked up.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.958

- Holy shit. What is that?
- See those cysts?

I did that. I found a way
to kill these things.

company Kemerall.

04:47.510 --> 04:50.210

agent. We need to take it wide.

04:50.212 --> 04:52.712
Then we take it to DOD
to disperse it.

04:52.714 --> 04:55.014

calling it a bioweapon.

04:55.016 --> 04:58.117
Germ warfare is nasty,
it'll scare people off.

04:58.119 --> 05:00.385

05:03.956 --> 05:05.922
All right?
Far too delicate for DOD.

05:07.859 --> 05:10.526

of the National Guard.

05:10.528 --> 05:12.961

a great contact at Kemerall.

05:30.644 --> 05:33.544
- Thanks for the introduction.

05:33.546 --> 05:35.946
Is this your son?
- No, no, no.

05:35.948 --> 05:38.882
No, no, his old man's away
on an important mission.

05:38.884 --> 05:40.984
He might be gone for
a while, but, uh,

05:40.986 --> 05:44.120
till he gets back, we're gonna
look after Z Man. Right, Z Man?

05:47.325 --> 05:50.459
- I'm gonna go eat in my room.

05:53.664 --> 05:56.064
- He's shy.

05:56.066 --> 05:59.400
Or he doesn't like you.
- Thanks.

06:01.170 --> 06:03.837
(knocking)
- Zach,

06:03.839 --> 06:07.273
did your dad say anything to you
about how long he might be gone?

06:07.275 --> 06:09.074
- No.

06:16.249 --> 06:19.450
- Well,

06:19.452 --> 06:21.952
it could be a couple days;

06:21.954 --> 06:25.921
it could also be quite
a bit longer than that.

06:25.923 --> 06:29.858
- He goes on work trips
all the time.

06:29.860 --> 06:32.594
When I was little, he went
to Africa for, like,

06:32.596 --> 06:35.096
six months.

06:39.435 --> 06:42.102
- Are you okay? With me?

06:42.104 --> 06:43.803
With everybody?

06:43.805 --> 06:46.672

07:04.121 --> 07:07.422
Thanks for asking, young man.

07:20.401 --> 07:22.801

07:22.803 --> 07:26.137
All right,
okay, fine.

07:26.139 --> 07:28.539
It's just some crazy

11:12.921 --> 11:14.921
What's your vision
for dispersion?

11:14.923 --> 11:16.489
- Variable, depending on
density of infected

11:16.491 --> 11:18.257
and weather conditions.

11:18.259 --> 11:22.093
For Manhattan, I'd say 100 kilos

- With 100 kilos, your rate of
mortality could reach as high

11:33.138 --> 11:36.105
as three million. Did you
think of adding a steroid

11:36.107 --> 11:38.874
to increase the mortality rate?
- That's a good thought,

11:38.876 --> 11:41.142

is near 100 percent as is.

11:41.144 --> 11:43.344
You studied biochemistry?
- At Princeton.

11:43.346 --> 11:44.878

You're saying

11:44.880 --> 11:46.546

11:57.658 --> 12:00.792
We can study it further once

12:11.503 --> 12:13.135

to this thing.

12:22.977 --> 12:26.211
And another friend of mine
lost his wife.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.214

an outbreak to me.

12:33.652 --> 12:36.219

- No. Don't say anything.
- It's not what you think--

12:44.661 --> 12:46.761
- What I think is it's none
of my business, all right?

12:46.763 --> 12:49.396
Or yours. So just...
don't say a word, all right?

12:54.769 --> 12:57.603
- I left word with our
Chief Research Officer.

12:57.605 --> 13:00.238
I'll pitch him on it
with my full support.

13:10.183 --> 13:12.683
- Now, Palmer was buying
properties here, here, here,

13:12.685 --> 13:15.619
plus six or seven more upstate.
He was hiring architects,

13:15.621 --> 13:18.355
contractors, offering
to triple their wages.

13:18.357 --> 13:20.390
- Why? What's he
turning them into?

13:20.392 --> 13:22.392
- I don't know.

13:22.394 --> 13:24.394
Whenever the plans were being
discussed with Eichorst,

13:24.396 --> 13:26.362
I was asked to leave the room.

13:26.364 --> 13:28.731
- Conveniently,
you have no idea.

13:28.733 --> 13:31.033
- That's funny. I don't remember
you calling bullshit

13:31.035 --> 13:34.636
when I spared your life.
I do know he bought

13:34.638 --> 13:37.038
these industrial properties,
and the team rebuilding them

13:37.040 --> 13:39.040
is the same team Stoneheart
uses to build

13:39.042 --> 13:41.142
black site prisons on contract
for the US military.

13:41.144 --> 13:43.144
- What's driving him?

13:43.146 --> 13:45.246
- Pardon?
- He has all the money

13:45.248 --> 13:46.880
and power he ever needs.

13:46.882 --> 13:49.883
Why is he doing this?
What does he want?

13:49.885 --> 13:52.819
- Palmer's been on the precipice
of death for 50 years.

13:52.821 --> 13:55.221
Some people might make peace
with that, but Palmer...

13:55.223 --> 13:57.289
he made a bargain instead.

13:59.226 --> 14:01.593
- He wants to be one of them.
- Wait.

14:01.595 --> 14:03.928
Are you saying that he started
an apocalypse

14:03.930 --> 14:05.930
to become a muncher?

14:05.932 --> 14:09.733
- No, not just any muncher,
an elevated one.

14:09.735 --> 14:13.470
He believes he's going to be
the Master's partner.

14:17.842 --> 14:20.242
- Damn.

14:42.532 --> 14:46.300
- I have a delivery,
to 111th and Madison.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.768
- Don't you realize
how psychotic this is

14:47.770 --> 14:49.369
or are you really
in that much denial?

14:49.371 --> 14:51.871
- This restaurant is paying
for your education, huh?

14:51.873 --> 14:53.839
- What education, Dad?

14:53.841 --> 14:54.840
Classes are canceled
indefinitely,

14:54.842 --> 14:56.274
so what am I studying for?

14:56.276 --> 14:59.844
- Tut! I'm not having
this discussion.

15:04.449 --> 15:07.550
- You know, it can be dangerous
out there even during the day.

15:09.220 --> 15:12.487
I can go with you.

15:12.489 --> 15:16.290
- I'll go with her
if she needs help.

15:16.292 --> 15:19.059
- With all due respect,
got a lot more experience

15:19.061 --> 15:21.528
dealing with these monsters
than you do.

15:23.164 --> 15:25.631
She'll be all right.
- The only way

15:25.633 --> 15:29.467
I'm letting her walk out of here
with some horny gangbanger

15:29.469 --> 15:32.536
is if I am dead.
- Oh yeah?

15:32.538 --> 15:34.337
- Yeah.
- Dishwasher?

15:34.339 --> 15:38.107
Why don't we do this?
Why don't we let her decide?

15:44.648 --> 15:47.048
So what are you studying?
- Ah, pre-med.

15:47.050 --> 15:49.583
- Really?
- Organic chemistry and physics.

15:49.585 --> 15:51.885
I was going to be
a pulmonologist.

15:51.887 --> 15:53.219
- Save your breath.

15:53.221 --> 15:54.987
He doesn't know

15:54.989 --> 15:57.856
what you're talking about.
- Yeah, and you do?

15:57.858 --> 15:59.991
- A lung doctor.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.193
- Yeah, but now I'm not so sure.

16:02.195 --> 16:05.496
- You don't have to give up
on your dream just because--

16:05.498 --> 16:09.666
- It's not my exact dream. My
mom's cousin's a pulmonologist

16:09.668 --> 16:13.502
and she makes really good money.

16:13.504 --> 16:16.037
I thought once I got
to med school,

16:16.039 --> 16:18.039
I could make my own choices,

16:18.041 --> 16:20.741
but just now everything's
changing...

16:30.852 --> 16:33.585
- Come on.

16:35.522 --> 16:37.522
- What a gentleman.

16:37.524 --> 16:40.024
Where'd you learn
those manners?

16:40.026 --> 16:42.760
Same place
you got your tattoos?

16:42.762 --> 16:45.629
- Okay, I get it, man.
I thought I knew you,

16:45.631 --> 16:49.032
so you want to give me
a hard time.

16:49.034 --> 16:52.035
So here it is.

16:52.037 --> 16:54.904
I went to prison.
I was a thief.

16:54.906 --> 16:58.873
I wanted to be a fighter, but
I couldn't make a living at it.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.108
So I broke
my mother's heart,

17:01.110 --> 17:03.710
and I did a bid upstate.

17:03.712 --> 17:05.778
Now I'm nothing.

17:08.048 --> 17:10.548
You happy?
- Do I look happy?

17:10.550 --> 17:12.783
- Okay, come on, guys.
We're here.

17:18.556 --> 17:22.291
Uh, $99.75 and that's including
$50 for the delivery fee.

17:27.798 --> 17:31.733
- Keep the change.
- Nice.

17:31.735 --> 17:35.602
Twenty-five cent tip.
- Split it three ways?

17:35.604 --> 17:37.570
(growling)

17:37.572 --> 17:39.972
- Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on!

17:55.088 --> 17:58.589
Hey! Behind you!
Behind you! Look out!

18:01.994 --> 18:04.093
(screaming in pain)

18:05.763 --> 18:08.797
You okay?
- Can't you tell?

18:08.799 --> 18:12.299
- C'mon, c'mon, I got you.
Let's go. Let's go.

18:12.301 --> 18:14.333
I got you.

18:16.537 --> 18:19.137
- So, I'm doing this stint
at Doctors Without Borders,

18:19.139 --> 18:21.139
setting up a small clinic
in Kinshasa

18:21.141 --> 18:23.141
administering the MMR vaccine

18:23.143 --> 18:26.377
to children. Week three or so,

18:26.379 --> 18:28.812
the military decides
we're infecting the kids,

18:28.814 --> 18:31.381
not inoculating them,
shut us down,

18:31.383 --> 18:33.816
threw me in jail.
- Jail! Oh, my God.

18:33.818 --> 18:35.284
- Oh yeah.
- Claimed I was part

18:35.286 --> 18:37.953
of an American
spy operation.

18:37.955 --> 18:40.989
Credentials don't mean shit
when they decide you're a spy.

18:40.991 --> 18:43.458
Finally, day four,

18:43.460 --> 18:46.060
this guy shows up from
Doctors Without Borders,

18:46.062 --> 18:48.996
saying he's my boss,
gets me out of jail.

18:48.998 --> 18:50.831
- "Saying" he's your boss?

18:50.833 --> 18:52.833
- Never seen him before
in my life.

18:52.835 --> 18:55.001
Turns out he's not with
Doctors Without Borders at all.

18:55.003 --> 18:56.068
He's with the--

18:56.070 --> 18:59.404
- US State Department.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.739
Well, that's not the first time
I played doctor.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.974
- That's how you guys met?
- Uh-huh.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.777
- Yeah. I got the clinic
up and running,

19:06.779 --> 19:09.012
and Rob and I hung out
for the rest of my time there.

19:10.081 --> 19:12.014
- I knew you were a spy.

19:12.016 --> 19:14.082
- I was a defense attaché

19:14.084 --> 19:16.084
attached to the State
Department,

19:16.086 --> 19:18.920
I'll have you know.
- That means he was a spy.

19:18.922 --> 19:22.689
(cell phone ringing)

19:22.691 --> 19:24.757
- This is Leigh.

19:26.026 --> 19:28.926
Thanks, Jonas. Yeah. Great.

19:28.928 --> 19:31.428
Will do.

19:31.430 --> 19:34.097
The CRO wants a meeting
tomorrow. We're in play.

19:34.099 --> 19:36.599
- Yes.

19:36.601 --> 19:38.434
Big hurdle.

19:38.436 --> 19:40.936
But let's not forget,
this is just the first step.

19:40.938 --> 19:43.371
- Where you going?
- Oh, I have a date

19:43.373 --> 19:44.972
with the lady I met last night.

19:44.974 --> 19:47.140
You two seem to be
getting on okay,

19:47.142 --> 19:50.343
so why don't you
let yourself in?

19:53.114 --> 19:55.547
- Rob's a man
of many talents.

19:55.549 --> 19:59.150
- He's good at putting
people together.

19:59.152 --> 20:02.286
- So what did he
tell you about me?

20:02.288 --> 20:05.489
- Ah, he said Leigh Thomas
is smart.

20:05.491 --> 20:08.792
Diligent. Ambitious.

20:08.794 --> 20:11.060
- An okay dancer?

20:11.062 --> 20:14.229
- He said phenomenal.
- Hm!

20:14.231 --> 20:16.231
He wouldn't know, you know.

20:16.233 --> 20:19.968
- Oh no.
- Oh, he's tried. They all try.

20:19.970 --> 20:22.637
- The lobbyists?
- It's the culture. Wining,

20:22.639 --> 20:26.073
dining. It's part of the job,
or so they think.

20:26.075 --> 20:28.642
- It must get so tiring,

20:28.644 --> 20:30.644
saying no all the time.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.880
- I don't say no
all the time.

20:38.686 --> 20:40.986
Rob didn't say much about you.

20:40.988 --> 20:44.322
Old friend, but
wouldn't get specific.

20:44.324 --> 20:46.557
- Building the mystery.

20:48.561 --> 20:50.994
- I like mystery.

21:08.112 --> 21:10.712
No, he's here.
He's fine.

21:10.714 --> 21:14.115
Well, I-I'm fine, too,
thanks for asking.

21:14.117 --> 21:17.017
Uh, o-okay, Rob.

21:17.019 --> 21:20.253
Hey, wish me luck today.

21:21.456 --> 21:24.690
Your friend checking up on you

21:24.692 --> 21:28.193
since you never came home.
He seemed worried.

21:28.195 --> 21:30.628
- You should know
there are some people

21:30.630 --> 21:32.863
who might not want to see
this disease stopped.

21:32.865 --> 21:35.131
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

21:35.133 --> 21:37.733
- Bring 'em on.
I love a good scuffle.

21:37.735 --> 21:41.469
And how are you this morning?
- Drank too much.

21:41.471 --> 21:44.538
- Any other regrets?

21:44.540 --> 21:46.439
- None.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.815
What's this?
- Standard NDA

21:56.817 --> 22:00.718
for your signature.
- Non-disclosure?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.953
This isn't an NDA.
This is a waiver

22:02.955 --> 22:05.055
signing everything
over to Kemerall.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.589
- You know they won't look
at anything

22:06.591 --> 22:08.591
without an exclusivity agreement

22:08.593 --> 22:11.093
and proprietary rights.
- Under normal circumstances,

22:11.095 --> 22:12.727
yeah, but not when
there's an outbreak

22:12.729 --> 22:14.595
threatening the entire
human population.

22:14.597 --> 22:15.996
- Did you honestly think
they would

22:15.998 --> 22:17.497
agree to this on a handshake?

22:17.499 --> 22:18.998
- This is astonishing.
Even when the world

22:19.000 --> 22:20.566
is going to total shit,

22:20.568 --> 22:22.901
people can't get past
their own self-interest.

22:22.903 --> 22:25.603
- This is my job.

22:25.605 --> 22:28.738
I'm doing exactly what
you wanted me to do.

22:30.942 --> 22:34.009
If we hadn't spent
the night together,

22:34.011 --> 22:36.644
you wouldn't be asking
these questions.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.814
Sign the paper.

22:43.451 --> 22:46.685
You know how this works.

22:55.195 --> 22:57.595
That looks good on you.

23:01.299 --> 23:04.266
- Pitiful,

23:04.268 --> 23:07.035
this city of New York.

23:07.037 --> 23:09.871
I expected Constantinople,

23:09.873 --> 23:12.106
Baghdad before the Mongols.

23:12.108 --> 23:13.807
Rome. Oh.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.609
Those were cities.
This is a factory.

23:17.611 --> 23:19.477
A machine.

23:19.479 --> 23:21.846
I can see why he started here.

23:22.882 --> 23:24.514
You indulged him.

23:24.516 --> 23:26.449
You looked the other way
for too long.

23:26.451 --> 23:30.286
Perhaps you're growing
complacent.

23:30.288 --> 23:33.222
You should have stopped him
70 years ago,

23:33.224 --> 23:34.957
if not seven centuries ago.

23:34.959 --> 23:38.660
(sighing)

23:38.662 --> 23:42.463
I get no pleasure
from your anxiety.

23:42.465 --> 23:45.632
I trained Vaun and the others
to be better; they failed us.

23:45.634 --> 23:49.002
I'm here now.

23:49.004 --> 23:52.305
I will stop him.

23:52.307 --> 23:54.307
But for my own reasons.

23:54.309 --> 23:57.677
I sensed him
when he was injured.

23:57.679 --> 24:00.646
I need to know who got
close enough to hurt him.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.848
And I need human hunters

24:02.850 --> 24:05.083
who can work during the day.

24:09.321 --> 24:11.387
That is, if you have any left.

24:15.592 --> 24:17.892
- Oh.

24:17.894 --> 24:21.428
Do you think
these would fit you?

24:21.430 --> 24:23.663
- Nora,

24:23.665 --> 24:25.698
I don't wear underwear
with pictures on 'em.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.933
- Right. Me neither.

24:27.935 --> 24:30.535
- Have at it, kiddo.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.603
- Hey.

24:33.606 --> 24:36.206
How you doing, Justine?

24:36.208 --> 24:38.208
- Gettin' through it.

24:38.210 --> 24:42.178
We are a day or two away
from declaring Red Hook

24:42.180 --> 24:44.847
infection-free.
- Really?

24:44.849 --> 24:48.083
Then what's next?
- The Mayor is pressuring me

24:48.085 --> 24:50.718
to move into Manhattan, but it's
gotta be someplace winnable.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.953
- Hey, these
are awesome!

24:52.955 --> 24:55.021
Look at these!
- Wow!

24:56.357 --> 24:58.724
Can we take a few things?
Do you mind?

24:58.726 --> 25:00.726
- Your kid?

25:00.728 --> 25:03.729
- No, no. Um, his dad left town.

25:03.731 --> 25:06.464
I don't know
if he's coming back.

25:08.367 --> 25:10.567
His mother, she's...
she's already gone.

25:10.569 --> 25:12.868
- Turned?
- Mm-hmm.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.304
- Doesn't he have any other
family you could contact?

25:17.306 --> 25:20.240
I mean, grandparents?
- We tried the mother's parents

25:20.242 --> 25:22.575
-they live on
Sea Island, Georgia-

25:22.577 --> 25:24.410
but I haven't been able
to reach them and have

25:24.412 --> 25:26.445
no way of knowing if they've
been trying to contact us.

25:27.381 --> 25:29.714
It's late.

25:29.716 --> 25:32.316
We should get going.
- Oh, hey, Bennett,

25:32.318 --> 25:34.484
give these good people
a ride home.

25:34.486 --> 25:36.786
- Thank you.

25:45.929 --> 25:48.229
- Not so easy to get humans

25:48.231 --> 25:51.232
to do your bidding, is it?

25:51.234 --> 25:54.735
- Human laziness and distraction

25:54.737 --> 25:57.904
benefitted us in the initial
stage of our plan.

25:57.906 --> 26:00.072
Now it is an obstacle.

26:02.142 --> 26:04.675
The Master's breed
are a superior race

26:04.677 --> 26:06.677
in every respect.

26:06.679 --> 26:08.445
- The Ancients attacked me
at my home.

26:08.447 --> 26:10.346
Singled me out
for kidnapping or death.

26:10.348 --> 26:13.816
- We saw that you were
quite efficient

26:13.818 --> 26:16.652
with your UV laser trap.

26:18.589 --> 26:21.523
Are there any other devices
in your penthouse

26:21.525 --> 26:23.525
we should be aware of?

26:23.527 --> 26:26.761
- I need to speak with
the Master immediately.

26:26.763 --> 26:29.964
- I will pass along
your request.

26:29.966 --> 26:33.434
- It is not a request.
You know what's happening

26:33.436 --> 26:36.670
tomorrow. Once we deploy
the next phase,

26:36.672 --> 26:39.339
we are on a very specific clock.

26:41.276 --> 26:43.342
Is he hurt?

26:46.880 --> 26:49.280
There is something
you're not telling me.

26:51.217 --> 26:55.652
- You do yourself no favor
by questioning him.

26:55.654 --> 26:58.788
- I need to know that our plan
is not in jeopardy

26:58.790 --> 27:01.724
before I proceed.
And that he is able

27:01.726 --> 27:04.293
to uphold his side
of the bargain.

27:04.295 --> 27:06.461
- Let me assure you--

27:06.463 --> 27:09.130
- Your assurance is not enough!
I assure you,

27:09.132 --> 27:11.966
I didn't become one of the
wealthiest men in the world

27:11.968 --> 27:15.736
by being played
for a fool.

27:15.738 --> 27:18.839
Either he is ignoring me
or avoiding me.

27:18.841 --> 27:22.242
Tell him he does so
at his peril.

27:22.244 --> 27:24.811
- For your sake,

27:24.813 --> 27:27.647
I shall tell him no such thing.

27:31.319 --> 27:33.352
- This is the largest deployment
of National Guard troops

27:33.354 --> 27:34.886
in history.

27:34.888 --> 27:37.855
So when I hear criticism
of our efforts,

27:37.857 --> 27:40.390
naturally it gets my fur up.

27:40.392 --> 27:43.160
- Have you been to New York City
since the virus broke?

27:43.162 --> 27:46.196
And I mean not in a chopper
surveying the island.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.431
I mean on the ground,
up close and personal.

27:48.433 --> 27:51.100
- We've thrown a ton
of resources at New York,

27:51.102 --> 27:53.669
but I admit things have gone
sideways in Manhattan.

27:53.671 --> 27:56.271
- "Sideways" is generous.
The city is eating itself.

27:56.273 --> 27:58.106
- He's passionate
about this, Dean.

27:58.108 --> 28:00.775
I thought you'd appreciate that.
Zero rhetoric.

28:00.777 --> 28:03.010
- But who's going
to oversee this?

28:03.012 --> 28:05.112
Logistics, accounting,

28:05.114 --> 28:07.280
manufacturing,
distribution.

28:07.282 --> 28:10.149
You need a huge company
in the military sector.

28:10.151 --> 28:13.118
Like Stoneheart Corporation--
- No, not Stoneheart.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.120
Any other private sector
company, but I don't want this

28:15.122 --> 28:17.122
getting sucked into
Eldritch Palmer's empire.

28:17.124 --> 28:18.490
- We'll find the
right partner.

28:18.492 --> 28:20.525
We can work out
particulars as we go,

28:20.527 --> 28:22.627
but you're down with saving
this country, right, General?

28:22.629 --> 28:24.395
- I thought you said
no rhetoric.

28:24.397 --> 28:27.864
- No rhetoric.
Saving this country.

28:30.635 --> 28:33.068
- Get me a canister
of this whatever-it-is.

28:33.070 --> 28:35.136
We'll want to
field-test it ourselves.

28:35.138 --> 28:37.004
- Which means?

28:37.006 --> 28:39.006
- Meaning yes.

28:39.008 --> 28:41.141
I'll help make this happen.

28:44.346 --> 28:46.412
- All right.

28:55.922 --> 28:58.923
(radio transmission)

28:58.925 --> 29:01.659
- [Black hair, dark eyes.]

29:01.661 --> 29:04.495
[Five ten, 120--]

29:08.167 --> 29:11.101
- Jesus Christ! Shit!
- What was that?!

29:11.103 --> 29:13.436
- You two stay in here.

29:17.607 --> 29:20.774
Oh, my God.
(growling)

29:26.514 --> 29:29.281
(thud)
(growling)

29:29.283 --> 29:32.450
- When I say go, I want you
to run as fast as you can

29:32.452 --> 29:34.518
into that church. Understand?
- Okay.

29:38.289 --> 29:40.756
- Okay, go! Go!

29:40.758 --> 29:44.259
RUN! RUN!
(growling)

29:47.364 --> 29:49.864
Go! Go!

29:49.866 --> 29:52.432
(growling)

29:54.869 --> 29:56.601
- It's locked!

29:59.372 --> 30:01.638
- Come on in!

30:11.549 --> 30:13.549
- Was--was that my mom?

30:14.818 --> 30:16.918
- Come on.

30:16.920 --> 30:20.421
- "Do not allow your guilt

30:20.423 --> 30:22.423
"to get the better of you.

30:22.425 --> 30:25.159
"What's done is done
and cannot be changed.

30:25.161 --> 30:27.594
"Things without all remedy

30:27.596 --> 30:31.296
should be without regard."
Shakespeare.

30:32.565 --> 30:34.331
(cell phone ringing)

30:34.333 --> 30:38.068
Hello?

30:41.606 --> 30:43.572
We're on our way.

30:43.574 --> 30:46.107
Grab your weapons.

30:46.109 --> 30:48.409
- Come on. Let's go! Let's go!

30:56.584 --> 30:59.651
(hissing)

31:00.620 --> 31:02.853
- Oh, God. Come on.

31:10.528 --> 31:13.262
(growling)
- Shit!

31:26.476 --> 31:29.944
(wheezing)

31:33.782 --> 31:37.350
Okay, come on.

32:05.913 --> 32:08.980
(sniffing)
(clicking sound)

32:18.323 --> 32:20.323
(growling)

32:27.664 --> 32:30.931
Let's go!

32:34.936 --> 32:38.437
(snarling)

32:45.178 --> 32:48.245
Come on.

33:03.561 --> 33:05.694
(coughing)

33:05.696 --> 33:08.029
(growling)

33:18.240 --> 33:20.707
Shh, shh...

33:39.494 --> 33:41.961
- Nora!
- Here!

33:45.266 --> 33:49.568
Be careful! They're fast.

33:49.570 --> 33:51.570
- Yeah, I know.
- Let's get to the truck.

33:51.572 --> 33:54.406
(growling)

33:54.408 --> 33:56.241
(empty chamber sound)

34:01.347 --> 34:04.514
- What is that thing?
- I don't know.

34:05.850 --> 34:08.317
Watch out!
- Ah!!

34:16.760 --> 34:21.028
(screeching growl)

34:21.030 --> 34:23.163
- Hey, Mama Bear.

34:37.479 --> 34:39.679
- Yeah,

34:39.681 --> 34:42.348
I know what that means.

34:45.953 --> 34:49.054
Don't let me become one of them.

34:49.056 --> 34:51.356
- There's no other choice.

34:54.994 --> 34:58.362
Get him to the truck.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.739
Thank you for your help.

35:09.741 --> 35:13.208
- I did what I could.

35:14.811 --> 35:16.911
Tell my brother I tried.

35:16.913 --> 35:21.548
- I will convey your message.
- Please, just make this--

35:35.896 --> 35:37.328
- You don't think I could

35:37.330 --> 35:39.330
use that phone
to call New York, do you?

35:39.332 --> 35:41.165
- You can try,
but you won't get through.

35:41.167 --> 35:42.666
Try to call my brother
every hour.

35:42.668 --> 35:44.167
- Make it two.
- Sure.

35:44.169 --> 35:46.169
- Well?

35:46.171 --> 35:47.937
- He went for it.
- Yes!

35:47.939 --> 35:51.040
- Long way to go. Kemerall needs
to duplicate the science.

35:51.042 --> 35:53.509
But the door is open.
If your product

35:53.511 --> 35:55.544
can withstand the scrutiny--
- It can.

35:55.546 --> 35:58.046
- Then we could have a firm
up or down answer in 72 hours.

35:58.048 --> 36:00.848
True to my word.

36:00.850 --> 36:02.783
- I didn't doubt it. It's just
it's so goddamn important,

36:02.785 --> 36:04.785
I wish I could
walk it through myself.

36:04.787 --> 36:07.754
- Why can't you?
(sighing)

36:09.691 --> 36:12.358
- It's a long story.

36:13.527 --> 36:15.193
The most important thing

36:15.195 --> 36:17.195
is that we push this through
as fast as possible.

36:17.197 --> 36:18.863
Seventy-two hours?
- They're gonna test it tonight.

36:18.865 --> 36:20.197
That's lightning fast.

36:20.199 --> 36:21.731
- Keep pushing
the financial upside.

36:21.733 --> 36:23.733
This is the beginning
of a long siege.

36:23.735 --> 36:26.702
- To the future.

36:26.704 --> 36:28.437
- The future.

36:33.911 --> 36:36.711
- Let's get out of here.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.813
- Rob?

36:39.815 --> 36:42.949
- Rob! Hey!
- You home?

36:42.951 --> 36:45.551
Good news!

36:45.553 --> 36:47.486
- Rob!

36:47.488 --> 36:48.687
- Huh.

36:49.723 --> 36:53.224
Not here.
- So we wait.

36:53.226 --> 36:55.793
- I don't want to wait!
I want to keep this going.

36:55.795 --> 36:57.094
Call him on your cell.

36:57.096 --> 36:58.895
- Uh... right.

36:59.998 --> 37:03.766
(chuckling)

37:03.768 --> 37:06.902
- Oh, straight to voice mail.
Ooh.

37:06.904 --> 37:10.105
This morning when you thought
last night was just about me

37:10.107 --> 37:13.341
getting you to sign that
release, that really hurt.

37:13.343 --> 37:16.110
- I'm sorry.

37:16.112 --> 37:18.412
I don't know who
to trust right now.

37:18.414 --> 37:22.081
So,

37:22.083 --> 37:23.682
what now?

37:23.684 --> 37:27.318
- Hmm... How about this?

37:30.589 --> 37:32.589
- You know, I was thinking

37:32.591 --> 37:35.124
we should keep half of
that sample to ourselves

37:35.126 --> 37:37.126
and the other half
to the National Guard.

37:37.128 --> 37:40.996
- Oh my God, are you actually
still talking about this?

37:43.200 --> 37:46.000
(screaming)

37:47.970 --> 37:50.036
- Oh, my God...

37:52.940 --> 37:54.940
- I'll call 911!
- No, don't! Leigh, wait!

37:54.942 --> 37:57.008
- Shit! Oh, shit!

38:01.814 --> 38:04.281
- Goodweather.
- Leigh.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.383
Now, just run.
He's here for me,

38:06.385 --> 38:08.852
not for you. No! Leigh!

38:27.239 --> 38:29.172
Leigh!

38:29.174 --> 38:32.141
- Who are you?

39:04.374 --> 39:07.975
- The great transformation
is imminent, Gabriel.

39:07.977 --> 39:11.311
You are blessed to be
invited to witness it.

39:11.313 --> 39:14.280
- I only wish to serve him.

39:14.282 --> 39:18.049
- Can you comprehend how
profound this honor is for me?

39:18.051 --> 39:20.451
No.

39:20.453 --> 39:22.519
Of course not.

39:25.023 --> 39:27.690
Wait here.

39:27.692 --> 39:31.059
You will witness
something extraordinary.

39:33.396 --> 39:36.730
The moment is at hand.

39:44.839 --> 39:48.140
My lord.

40:05.425 --> 40:08.893
My liege.

40:11.497 --> 40:13.563
I stand ready

40:13.565 --> 40:16.332
to receive your infinite power.

40:34.518 --> 40:38.285
- Do you seek communion
with the lord,

40:38.287 --> 40:40.787
my son?

40:43.558 --> 40:45.558
- All my life I waited to hear

40:45.560 --> 40:47.726
the voice of God inside of me.

40:47.728 --> 40:50.761
To receive him
in me.

40:52.698 --> 40:55.765
- No.

41:12.249 --> 41:16.284
- This is my body.
- Master.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.460
(retching)

41:31.732 --> 41:34.833
(screaming)

41:34.835 --> 41:37.135
Master!

41:54.453 --> 41:57.520
Master! Master!

42:06.363 --> 42:09.430
(sobbing)

42:28.183 --> 42:30.316
- Eichorst.

42:30.318 --> 42:33.152
Prove to me no matter
what form I take,

42:33.154 --> 42:35.220
you shall serve me.

42:37.324 --> 42:39.791
Kneel.

42:54.574 --> 42:56.874
- Forever, Master.
