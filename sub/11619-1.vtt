01:12.372 --> 01:14.648
Do you like your job?

01:16.209 --> 01:19.418
You're weird today.
Almost made us crash and all.

01:21.481 --> 01:22.892
Well, don't you?

01:23.716 --> 01:26.822
I'm just doing it because
I've been doing it for so long.

01:27.787 --> 01:30.165
It's just work.
What's there to like or not like?

01:31.958 --> 01:33.528
I dropped out of high school.

01:34.127 --> 01:35.538
Where would I find a job like this?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.169
I've got no complaints.

01:39.232 --> 01:42.179
Put in a good word for me
for a raise.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.707
You're not getting enough?

01:45.438 --> 01:47.782
This job is so unstable.

01:49.309 --> 01:50.913
You never know
when you'll get the sack.

01:51.878 --> 01:54.882
But you're only 20.

01:55.048 --> 01:55.788
So what?

01:56.382 --> 01:58.089
Don't you wanna make
something of yourself?

01:59.352 --> 02:01.593
I want to be rich.
Filthy rich.

02:02.188 --> 02:05.601
I'm gonna save up for 5 years
and take off.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.567
Head to Miami or LA.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.931
Live it large
with some white chicks.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.540
What about you, boss?

02:16.836 --> 02:18.179
When you were 20.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.047
Me?

02:23.309 --> 02:25.311
I wanted to become a singer.

02:27.413 --> 02:28.653
Why didn't you?

02:28.748 --> 02:31.058
Not 'didn't'. I couldn't.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.562
It's a bullshit career.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.326
Once you lose the limelight,
there is nothing.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.300
You talk as if you've been there.

02:39.859 --> 02:42.203
I know someone who has.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.604
Yeah? Who?

03:12.926 --> 03:14.564
Jeez, couldn't you pack it properly?

03:16.796 --> 03:18.139
It's not our job.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.411
You toss them boxes around
like a damn rag doll.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.277
Did you see it?

03:23.303 --> 03:24.008
What?

03:25.038 --> 03:27.814
See us tossing them around
like a rag doll?

03:29.509 --> 03:33.013
What the fuck, you punk?

03:39.385 --> 03:40.227
Shut up.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.480
- Hey.
- Did you eat, man?

04:16.422 --> 04:17.594
Don't worry. It's safe.

04:18.156 --> 04:19.067
Let's go.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.475
Yo, kimchi boy!
What are you doing here?

04:28.601 --> 04:29.545
Who's that?

04:30.136 --> 04:30.876
Stand back.

04:31.838 --> 04:32.680
Detective Park?

04:33.640 --> 04:34.550
Justa minute.

04:34.607 --> 04:35.608
What the heck?

04:35.808 --> 04:37.014
Turn around and face the wall.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.185
Who is that?

04:41.347 --> 04:42.655
Just some punk ass.

04:42.849 --> 04:43.520
What?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.858
What's he doing here?

04:46.052 --> 04:48.259
Where the fuck are you going?

04:56.863 --> 04:58.103
Face the goddamn wall!

05:06.039 --> 05:07.143
Shut the door!

05:27.193 --> 05:30.766
<i>Please try again.
Please try again.</i>

05:40.273 --> 05:42.753
I was never gonna talk.

05:59.859 --> 06:00.860
On my way down, boss.

06:25.852 --> 06:26.830
But, why?

06:28.521 --> 06:31.001
Don't take it personally.
It's just work.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.505
I got a favor.

06:47.874 --> 06:50.377
It's this building.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.758
<i>A COMPANY MAN</i>

08:58.504 --> 09:01.610
<i>supply Room</i>

10:08.474 --> 10:09.509
You're late.

10:17.650 --> 10:21.154
Should've been back two hours ago.

10:27.460 --> 10:32.068
Please, Mrs. Yang.
You're leaving prints.

10:32.398 --> 10:37.040
I've been doing this
since you were playing with BB guns.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.448
Put on the damn gloves.

10:49.515 --> 10:52.052
So, what took you so long?

10:53.753 --> 10:54.788
I'm sorry, sir.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.461
That's not what I asked.

11:04.096 --> 11:05.074
Sorry.

11:13.639 --> 11:16.518
Using a temp on this job
was your idea.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.541
Somebody asked me for a favor.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.577
To pass on some money
he saved up.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.577
Is he dead?

11:53.612 --> 11:56.491
Why take favors from a dead guy?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.825
You lost the spark in your eyes.

12:03.322 --> 12:04.926
Just like when you first joined.

12:06.492 --> 12:07.937
You should see a doctor.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.578
Hyeong-do.

12:17.336 --> 12:20.909
You gotta stick it out
no matter what.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.812
Until the day you collect
your retirement check.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.523
For company men like us,

12:27.713 --> 12:28.691
that's how we win.

12:32.218 --> 12:34.994
Do you regret leaving?

12:37.056 --> 12:37.898
Do I regret it?

12:39.325 --> 12:43.171
With your company,
it's a love-hate relationship.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.005
After you walk away,
you want to go back

12:47.466 --> 12:50.606
but the idea of going back kills you.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.575
Do you know why I recruited you?

12:55.674 --> 12:57.312
You don't ask questions.

12:59.645 --> 13:00.453
That's who you are.

13:03.415 --> 13:04.621
Why did you leave?

13:09.255 --> 13:10.290
It was over nothing.

13:14.527 --> 13:18.031
Forgive me, Lord, for all my sins...

13:18.264 --> 13:21.871
Hey! What did I do?
Do you even know me?

13:22.701 --> 13:23.736
You can't kill me.

13:25.204 --> 13:30.779
Because if you do,
you'll only prove me wrong.

13:32.878 --> 13:33.982
But, I'm already dead.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.959
You'll never know, will you?

13:39.318 --> 13:42.561
That's right. I'm always right.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.233
See? You can't kill me.

13:44.456 --> 13:49.462
<i>Listening to his bullshit,
it dawned on me</i>

13:50.229 --> 13:53.574
<i>that the poor sucker
really wanted to live.</i>

14:00.272 --> 14:01.342
You want it?

14:01.941 --> 14:02.919
Shall I?

14:04.743 --> 14:07.553
Take it.
The Key's in the ignition.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.921
It'll all be yours,
after I'm gone.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.237
Mr. Ban,

14:23.629 --> 14:24.767
what happened to him?

14:26.565 --> 14:28.044
What do you mean what happened?

14:28.667 --> 14:29.737
It was work.

14:30.269 --> 14:33.045
I think you're right.

14:40.980 --> 14:45.725
The gun, the silencer...
Who the hell is this kid?

14:46.318 --> 14:48.355
Check the CCTV of nearby buildings first.

14:53.926 --> 14:54.927
Aren't you 910N197

14:55.427 --> 14:57.304
I doubt he joined the army yet.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.241
Probably no criminal record

15:02.067 --> 15:04.775
or finger prints in the system.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.242
Does Hun live here?

15:41.106 --> 15:43.985
You must be his sister.
Ls your mother in?

15:44.510 --> 15:45.818
My mom's dead.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.328
Is she here?

15:53.352 --> 15:56.299
She said her mom is dead.

15:59.758 --> 16:00.930
Son of a bitch!

16:15.107 --> 16:17.986
Don't you see that I'm working?
Who is it?

16:18.077 --> 16:19.351
I don't know.

16:27.252 --> 16:28.253
Who are you?

16:35.728 --> 16:37.071
Are you Hun's mother?

16:38.764 --> 16:40.675
I work in the same company as him.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.071
My son works in a company?

16:44.570 --> 16:47.813
He asked me to give this to you.

16:49.975 --> 16:51.283
Some money he saved up.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.516
He had to go abroad on business.

17:03.222 --> 17:06.101
Is he doing well at work?

17:07.291 --> 17:08.066
Yes, ma'am.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.540
He works hard and does a good job.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.709
The company has high hopes for him.

17:16.667 --> 17:17.544
Really?

17:18.537 --> 17:20.039
He sure takes work seriously.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.315
He went to work
even on the day dad died.

17:23.474 --> 17:24.282
Stop it.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.612
You know what he did?

17:27.479 --> 17:30.255
He called 911 and left for work.

17:30.582 --> 17:31.754
I said stop it.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.823
I'll be back early.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.898
You mean early in the morning?

17:40.692 --> 17:42.569
What the fuck is your problem?

17:42.961 --> 17:43.939
What did you say?

17:44.463 --> 17:46.204
Why won't you leave me alone?

17:46.432 --> 17:49.038
You're only 17.
At least until you graduate...

17:49.101 --> 17:53.174
You were a singer at my age.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.013
We have a guest.
We'll talk about this later.

17:58.110 --> 18:01.091
Wanna hear her song?

18:02.247 --> 18:03.590
It's tragically corny.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.128
Just get the hell out.

18:07.686 --> 18:08.630
I'll do what I want.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.375
Sorry about that.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.577
Don't worry about it.

18:27.706 --> 18:28.810
Turn it off!

19:03.542 --> 19:06.580
<i>Waiting Room
Yu Mi-yeon</i>

20:14.546 --> 20:16.890
I'm sorry. I left in a hurry.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.852
Don't worry. I asked you
to come in on short notice.

20:30.896 --> 20:31.738
I love you, sir.

20:35.467 --> 20:36.605
Who hired him?

20:37.135 --> 20:38.045
Mr. Gwon.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.463
That kid you recruited

20:54.753 --> 20:56.494
the one that used to clean the windows.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.659
Didn't we hire him?

20:59.591 --> 21:01.366
He worked the Gong case.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.339
We need reliable candidates

21:05.897 --> 21:08.017
with solid military backgrounds
or good social skills.

21:08.834 --> 21:12.976
Taking on wannabe gangsters will
turn us into a bunch of thugs.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.479
Help out Gwon.

21:16.808 --> 21:19.379
He's clueless because
he's never shed a drop of blood.

21:19.711 --> 21:20.553
Yes, sir.

21:23.615 --> 21:24.889
You know I've always liked you.

21:25.417 --> 21:26.327
Thank you, sir.

21:28.253 --> 21:29.596
Polite, too.

21:30.188 --> 21:31.531
- I love you, sir.
- All right.

21:34.559 --> 21:40.134
Your boss used to be
the newbie in the sales team.

21:40.866 --> 21:45.975
A brilliant kid with sharp eyes.

21:46.905 --> 21:50.216
We go way back to the factory days.

21:52.344 --> 21:55.018
All the way till Ban ran away.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.353
This doesn't have to go
through the strategy team.

22:00.018 --> 22:00.689
Sir?

22:01.053 --> 22:04.296
Jin is not away on business.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.503
His 7-year-old son was hit by a cab.

22:09.594 --> 22:10.629
The boy didn't make it.

22:12.798 --> 22:16.245
He is a genius little go player.

22:17.703 --> 22:18.875
Hell of a kid.

22:19.805 --> 22:22.342
Must get his brains from his mother.

22:22.441 --> 22:23.283
Right. eh?

22:24.710 --> 22:25.780
What did you say, man?

22:29.014 --> 22:32.723
<i>The cab driver's gone missing, too.</i>

22:34.953 --> 22:36.933
<i>Just keep an eye on him for now.</i>

22:48.333 --> 22:49.277
Hey!

22:51.737 --> 22:52.977
Get out, if you're not playing.

22:56.007 --> 22:57.008
Hey!

23:36.681 --> 23:39.594
<i>Yu Mi-ye on</i>

24:27.132 --> 24:30.739
You think you can get rid of me?

24:31.303 --> 24:34.477
That's not why I'm here.
Just give them a call.

24:36.241 --> 24:38.721
Everyone's worried about you.
The company will...

24:38.777 --> 24:40.417
The company will take care of everything?

24:41.146 --> 24:41.817
Always.

24:43.114 --> 24:47.756
Work was everything to me.
I did it for my wife and kid.

24:47.819 --> 24:48.319
Sir,

24:48.386 --> 24:53.267
I'm supposed to just forget it
and get back to work?

24:57.896 --> 25:00.604
Go and tell them

25:01.132 --> 25:02.338
that I'm out.

25:06.805 --> 25:09.115
Your supervisor...
he's lost it, hasn't he?

25:12.410 --> 25:13.548
He didn't go crazy?

25:19.251 --> 25:20.423
Then, he must be nuts.

25:26.224 --> 25:28.170
He struck you with the grip?

25:30.295 --> 25:33.071
Stay put until you get the clearance.

25:34.232 --> 25:36.872
You're next in line for promotion.

25:49.714 --> 25:54.026
How funny that you made
a mistake like that?

25:57.923 --> 25:59.630
First time, isn't it?

26:01.026 --> 26:01.970
I'm sorry.

26:10.502 --> 26:11.503
Get out of here.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.074
You said you had a meeting?

26:39.497 --> 26:40.202
Hello?

27:10.862 --> 27:12.535
Did I do something wrong?

27:17.769 --> 27:19.009
Did I screw up?

27:21.806 --> 27:23.080
Did you not like my work?

27:25.443 --> 27:26.046
No.

27:26.878 --> 27:31.384
I was gonna recommend him
for a permanent position.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.622
What's wrong with you?
Who'll play his part then?

27:36.521 --> 27:39.934
I heard some good things
about the kid, too.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.001
So, you wanna ditch the plan?

27:45.897 --> 27:46.534
No, sir.

27:47.599 --> 27:49.772
Can I trust that
you'll see this through?

27:54.906 --> 27:59.321
He has a mother and a sister
who we don't have to worry about.

28:03.515 --> 28:07.930
Have you grown fond of the kid
and had a change of heart?

28:10.889 --> 28:14.530
You were just a temp.

28:21.066 --> 28:23.342
Aim for precise points.
Here, here and here.

28:24.235 --> 28:24.940
Try again.

28:28.573 --> 28:30.712
Targefs name is Kevin Lee. Age 35.

28:31.076 --> 28:32.749
It's a case commissioned by

28:44.289 --> 28:46.530
<i>Levels 3 and 4 will be blocked.</i>

28:46.925 --> 28:49.633
Look here, Steve,
I'm gonna give you one more week.

28:50.628 --> 28:53.302
You'd better call me back
get your fund ready. OK?

28:56.868 --> 28:58.006
What the fuck?

29:22.360 --> 29:25.432
Fucking cheapskate giving me
a headache.

30:54.819 --> 30:56.162
Alright. Talk to you later.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.468
I'll meet you back in the office.

31:00.792 --> 31:01.793
Any problem, sir?

31:03.161 --> 31:04.401
Take care of the report for me.

31:16.241 --> 31:20.348
I'm sorry about last time.
I got so worried about him.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.956
That's okay.

31:30.722 --> 31:31.723
Are you out of your mind?

31:32.323 --> 31:33.131
What!

31:35.360 --> 31:39.172
The company is deeply regretful
about the accident.

31:39.264 --> 31:40.544
Will it be covered by insurance?

31:41.332 --> 31:42.572
Just shut up and eat your food.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.000
How did you go to America?
You don't speak a word of English.

31:46.638 --> 31:47.514
Shit!

31:48.840 --> 31:49.841
What the fuck?

31:50.041 --> 31:51.281
Can't you shut your mouths?

32:03.254 --> 32:04.494
Drink some water.

32:17.368 --> 32:18.369
Thank you.

32:19.270 --> 32:20.112
What can I get you?

32:20.204 --> 32:22.707
- Four beers and some dried squid.
- Yes.

32:23.207 --> 32:24.151
How much?

32:24.242 --> 32:25.653
- I'll get this.
- Please let me.

32:25.743 --> 32:27.313
I insist.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.393
It's my way of saying thank you.

32:30.949 --> 32:31.586
But...

32:32.016 --> 32:34.018
- How much is it?
- 15 dollars.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.861
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

32:40.091 --> 32:41.729
- Let me...
- Just that one, please?

32:43.695 --> 32:44.730
Have a good evening.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.743
This never happens.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.609
We always fight when we get together.

32:53.538 --> 32:55.984
What's that supposed to be?

32:56.107 --> 32:58.986
- The moves! I'm nailing it.
- No, it's not.

32:59.077 --> 32:59.885
Thank you.

33:04.449 --> 33:05.723
You talk a lot, don't you?

33:06.784 --> 33:07.592
Sorry.

33:08.386 --> 33:09.228
For what?

33:14.726 --> 33:18.230
I was 18 when I had Hun.

33:19.530 --> 33:21.771
I was afraid of nothing back then.

33:23.968 --> 33:25.572
It seems to get harder and harder

33:26.604 --> 33:28.948
to know what I'm supposed to be.

33:30.441 --> 33:34.287
I'm not sure if I'm being a mother
to them let alone a good mother.

33:35.113 --> 33:37.457
But, you are a good mother.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.288
All mothers are good.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.293
I suppose.

33:46.591 --> 33:48.832
It's a wonderful thing
to have a mother.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.922
<i>Termination of Director Jin approved.</i>

34:11.181 --> 34:14.994
There is no 'who'
in company's decisions.

34:16.721 --> 34:21.170
I was just curious
who gave the approval.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.829
The top brass have spoken.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.475
Where are you?

34:35.907 --> 34:37.147
Have you been drinking?

34:38.443 --> 34:40.684
You shouldn't be calling me.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.192
<i>I'm out for dinner with my family.</i>

34:46.516 --> 34:48.588
<i>What the fuck is your problem?</i>

35:58.322 --> 36:01.166
That's more like you.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.497
You could've run.

36:04.228 --> 36:05.002
Where to?

36:05.930 --> 36:07.841
I spent my whole life
getting blood on my hands.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.914
I can't hope that my kid will be safe.

36:13.538 --> 36:14.881
You don't have to do this.

36:15.540 --> 36:18.214
I got nothing to live for.
Just do it.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.484
There is nothing in your life?

36:23.080 --> 36:24.024
What do you care?

36:29.353 --> 36:30.161
I don't.

36:39.764 --> 36:40.765
Don't drink by yourself.

36:47.405 --> 36:48.247
Are we all set?

36:48.940 --> 36:50.010
- Miss Park?
- Sir.

36:50.341 --> 36:51.149
Is it on its way?

36:51.209 --> 36:54.884
It was sent to the office by accident.

36:55.913 --> 36:57.722
But, it's being delivered here
as we speak.

36:58.816 --> 37:00.796
It's almost here.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.631
You mean in the office?
When we're out here?

37:04.355 --> 37:06.562
Great job, guys.

37:07.358 --> 37:08.166
I'm sorry, sir.

37:09.193 --> 37:12.367
Did you bring that
to cut up steaks?

37:12.730 --> 37:14.732
Why don't you cut the pancakes
in front of you?

37:15.800 --> 37:16.642
Sorry.

37:17.835 --> 37:20.042
Just the shit I have to
put up with everyday.

37:22.206 --> 37:23.844
Ah...

37:24.842 --> 37:26.822
Who just died?
Come on, raise your cups!

37:27.178 --> 37:28.623
- Have a drink!
- Yes, sir.

37:28.846 --> 37:29.886
Fill your cups. Attention!

37:30.781 --> 37:33.921
Chairman will say a few words.

37:35.286 --> 37:35.855
Attention!

37:43.561 --> 37:45.507
We'll do it when the nameplate arrives.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.534
At ease, everyone.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.743
Is it made of mother of pearl?

37:53.204 --> 37:55.309
No. Crystal.

37:55.373 --> 37:57.819
Mother of pearl is too old fashioned.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.786
It's more classy.

37:59.944 --> 38:00.854
There it is.

38:03.247 --> 38:04.225
Don't come out.

38:17.328 --> 38:18.204
Say something.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.208
Thank you.

38:24.902 --> 38:25.744
That's it?

38:30.841 --> 38:33.378
This is quite heavy.

38:33.444 --> 38:35.720
Come on, Mr. Ji!

38:36.047 --> 38:38.550
That's what you said
when you were promoted to manager.

38:39.750 --> 38:40.922
I'll keep up the hard work.

38:41.585 --> 38:42.928
Come and have a drink with us.

38:45.856 --> 38:47.496
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, man.

38:53.331 --> 38:57.245
We diverted from the original plan again.
The intended COD was a fall.

38:57.868 --> 38:58.903
What's the issue?

39:01.005 --> 39:02.313
You saw the death certificate.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.047
This is becoming something of a habit.

39:05.509 --> 39:06.852
You know nothing about the field.

39:07.211 --> 39:10.215
Things never go according to plan.

39:14.719 --> 39:18.565
Come on, Director Ji!
Let's have a drink.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.081
<i>Are you free this weekend?</i>

40:36.600 --> 40:38.580
What about this one?

40:38.702 --> 40:41.945
Do you know how much that costs?

40:42.673 --> 40:43.617
Tightass.

40:44.308 --> 40:47.812
Why don't you take over?
Then, all this becomes yours.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.552
Are you trying to dump
your dying business on me?

40:53.884 --> 40:55.192
What do you mean dying business?

40:59.023 --> 41:02.004
Trying to pick a fight with me, girl?

41:06.730 --> 41:09.870
You put so much into this place.
It must be hard to let go.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.946
What choice do I have
when my daughter needs me?

41:14.672 --> 41:17.209
I don't want to give it up
for just anybody.

41:18.175 --> 41:19.279
You should take it.

41:19.844 --> 41:22.324
You know I can't afford it.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.593
You should let your hair down
once in a while.

41:25.382 --> 41:26.861
Meet someone nice, you know?

41:32.389 --> 41:34.767
Or have you already met one?

41:35.392 --> 41:36.166
Don't be silly.

41:38.562 --> 41:39.632
Where did you meet him?

41:41.499 --> 41:42.307
Just...

41:44.401 --> 41:47.405
He seems like a nice fella.
What does he do?

41:49.173 --> 41:51.619
He works in a company.

42:02.753 --> 42:03.993
This is really nice.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.597
You never thought about
going back to singing?

42:11.095 --> 42:15.635
I used to listen to you all the time.

42:19.470 --> 42:22.940
Why didn't you tell me
that you knew me?

42:24.241 --> 42:24.946
Just didn't.

42:31.048 --> 42:34.052
It's a stage name, actually.

42:34.818 --> 42:35.523
Yeah?

42:37.354 --> 42:43.498
It's Yuk Mi-yeon, not Yu.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.502
Yuk, as in six.

42:52.903 --> 42:54.007
Yuk Mi-yeon...

43:28.339 --> 43:29.181
He looks familiar.

43:30.541 --> 43:31.451
He's a singer, right?

43:33.477 --> 43:34.751
Think I saw him on TV.

43:37.281 --> 43:38.316
He's not?

43:40.484 --> 43:44.125
I told you they wouldn't have
recruited from these losers.

43:44.321 --> 43:46.494
A brainy one with a clean record.

43:58.769 --> 43:59.509
Excuse me!

44:04.008 --> 44:04.850
I'm with the police.

44:07.511 --> 44:08.649
What do you want?

44:11.682 --> 44:14.390
You can't park there.

44:14.551 --> 44:15.586
I'm leaving soon.

44:15.919 --> 44:16.840
Have you been drinking?

44:17.121 --> 44:17.656
No.

44:18.188 --> 44:21.761
I smell booze.
Let me see your license.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.081
I don't smell anything.

44:26.563 --> 44:27.837
If you don't mind.

44:35.105 --> 44:36.140
What do you do?

44:36.473 --> 44:37.313
I work for a company.

44:38.142 --> 44:39.052
Which one?

44:42.913 --> 44:43.721
Here. Happy now?

44:47.818 --> 44:48.990
Don't drink and drive.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.064
I didn't.

44:51.121 --> 44:52.395
So, don't.

44:54.091 --> 44:55.001
Let's go.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.241
Is he a police or a thug?

45:31.628 --> 45:34.074
The man you asked about...

46:03.093 --> 46:04.902
<i>What the hell are you doing
with that gun?</i>

46:05.696 --> 46:06.504
Pardon me?

46:11.568 --> 46:12.774
You're wasting the bullets.

46:14.905 --> 46:15.576
Sir?

46:17.040 --> 46:17.711
Give me the gun.

46:38.495 --> 46:43.035
You were supposed to
have taken care of this.

47:18.235 --> 47:19.509
You can all go fuck yourselves.

47:21.338 --> 47:23.318
You call this work?

47:24.041 --> 47:25.384
Let's put an end to this quietly.

47:27.244 --> 47:28.951
Shut your mouth for once.

47:29.913 --> 47:33.190
I'm tired of taking crap from an idiot
who greased his way to the top.

47:35.219 --> 47:36.859
What have you got in your fucking brains?

47:38.355 --> 47:42.701
You do this so-called 'work'
and go home to sleep.

47:43.727 --> 47:47.334
Come morning, get dressed,
come to work

47:47.931 --> 47:49.069
and do it all over again.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.543
What a life!
Are you happy?

48:04.114 --> 48:08.824
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

48:41.018 --> 48:41.689
Here.

48:44.688 --> 48:45.758
N.C.M.

48:46.456 --> 48:47.196
Excuse me.

48:50.727 --> 48:51.797
Must be an acronym.

48:53.530 --> 48:56.670
New Continent Metals, idiot.

48:57.334 --> 48:59.814
Hey! Hello!

49:02.806 --> 49:04.131
I'm sorry for calling
on you unexpectedly.

49:04.144 --> 49:05.480
What brings you here?

49:15.419 --> 49:17.899
It's an ordinary company.

49:18.188 --> 49:20.259
I can understand why he didn't kill Jin.

49:20.590 --> 49:21.967
After all, he was his supervisor.

49:22.993 --> 49:24.939
But if he killed the kid as planned,

49:25.529 --> 49:28.032
we'd have none of this hassle
from the cops.

49:31.835 --> 49:34.281
They couldn't identify the body.

49:39.476 --> 49:40.318
Are you satisfied?

49:40.477 --> 49:41.046
Sir?

49:41.445 --> 49:43.584
There's nothing about you
I could ever like.

49:44.314 --> 49:45.190
Come on.

50:07.804 --> 50:09.084
Just keep an eye on him for now.

50:09.406 --> 50:10.146
Yes, sir.

50:10.874 --> 50:15.823
You gave him your card
to avoid looking suspicious?

50:17.381 --> 50:17.950
Really?

50:22.452 --> 50:25.399
Why the hell not?

50:27.024 --> 50:27.934
I'm sorry, sir.

51:00.157 --> 51:00.862
Let go.

51:02.592 --> 51:04.003
Let go of me, motherfucker!

51:10.333 --> 51:14.008
Don't ever say you're sorry again.

51:16.073 --> 51:16.744
Yes, sir.

51:17.541 --> 51:20.920
I'm asking you as your superior.

51:22.112 --> 51:22.783
Yes, sir.

51:27.050 --> 51:28.256
Why did you give him the card?

51:28.819 --> 51:29.695
Here. Happy now?

51:32.923 --> 51:33.765
I'm sorry.

51:33.924 --> 51:36.461
You've never!
Given me!

51:36.593 --> 51:38.197
A straight answer!

51:38.295 --> 51:39.501
Son of a bitch.

51:41.698 --> 51:42.574
Tell me why!

51:55.112 --> 51:56.455
<i>Target is moving to third ﬂoor.</i>

51:58.682 --> 52:00.218
<i>Back entrance, report status.</i>

52:00.717 --> 52:01.752
<i>Back entrance, clear.</i>

52:02.652 --> 52:04.154
<i>Second unit, stand by.</i>

52:17.000 --> 52:18.035
<i>Confirm position.</i>

52:21.905 --> 52:23.077
<i>Target on the move.</i>

52:23.507 --> 52:24.212
<i>Eighth ﬂoor,</i>

52:25.308 --> 52:26.048
<i>7;</i>

52:26.977 --> 52:27.717
<i>6;</i>

52:28.979 --> 52:29.650
<i>5;</i>

52:30.947 --> 52:31.652
<i>4.</i>

52:53.603 --> 52:55.105
Good nignt.
See you tomorrow.

53:11.755 --> 53:13.826
Something happened at work?

53:15.458 --> 53:16.129
No.

53:22.265 --> 53:24.040
Something wrong with your noodles?

53:24.734 --> 53:25.371
No.

53:30.807 --> 53:31.842
Want to swap with mine?

53:32.676 --> 53:34.019
No, I'm fine.

53:38.782 --> 53:40.261
Do you like me?

53:40.350 --> 53:41.055
No, I...

53:45.722 --> 53:47.395
I'm just kidding.

53:55.732 --> 53:56.437
Mi-yeon.

53:58.635 --> 53:59.477
You're pretty-

54:05.709 --> 54:06.585
I'm just kidding.

54:11.548 --> 54:12.322
Terrible man.

54:12.549 --> 54:13.357
Hold on.

54:15.585 --> 54:16.461
Don't eat the tissue.

54:47.217 --> 54:49.219
You don't have to use it.

54:53.923 --> 54:54.799
It's very nice.

54:55.825 --> 54:57.429
It's not a very good one.

55:01.364 --> 55:03.901
Would you like some coffee?

55:04.668 --> 55:06.011
Yes, please.

55:25.088 --> 55:25.896
Mi-yeon.

55:26.823 --> 55:30.134
You know that cafe by the lake...

55:30.660 --> 55:31.263
Yeah.

55:32.829 --> 55:35.969
I have some money saved up.

55:37.701 --> 55:40.272
Would you like to have a go
at running it?

55:52.382 --> 55:54.589
The papenlvork is immaculate.

55:55.051 --> 55:57.386
But, there are all these
transactions with Japan

55:57.387 --> 56:00.129
with factory that's
not in operation.

56:00.290 --> 56:01.792
It can only mean one thing...

56:02.592 --> 56:03.832
But, it's in operation.

56:06.996 --> 56:08.373
Are you in operation?

56:09.866 --> 56:10.640
Go back.

56:12.769 --> 56:13.907
They want us to come around.

56:14.170 --> 56:19.848
Our principal client, Sukimoto Ltd.,

56:21.611 --> 56:25.787
is the No.1 manufacturer of small boats.

56:26.583 --> 56:27.944
Do you have any questions for him?

56:32.756 --> 56:35.202
Captain... Please!

56:38.962 --> 56:41.943
Detective Jo is a renowned nuisance
within the Major Crimes.

56:42.832 --> 56:45.176
He got passed over for promotion
a number of times already.

56:46.503 --> 56:48.744
It's safe to write off
what he has to say.

56:49.539 --> 56:52.748
- What are your thoughts?
- We agree that...

56:52.809 --> 56:56.018
Should we get rid of Ji?
Everyone makes mistakes.

57:07.757 --> 57:09.930
Do you believe this was a mistake, too?

57:23.239 --> 57:24.616
It's yours now.

57:26.609 --> 57:27.815
You're not taking it with you?

57:28.711 --> 57:31.419
He included it in the contract.

57:32.582 --> 57:34.152
Why don't you play a tune for us?

57:35.218 --> 57:36.026
Forget it.

57:40.390 --> 57:44.463
Can you believe that
she was once a professional singer?

57:45.495 --> 57:48.135
Would you like some tea?

57:48.798 --> 57:49.469
Thank you.

57:50.667 --> 57:54.843
We got some new assam tea.
You should try it.

58:51.060 --> 58:53.597
<i>Letter of Resignation</i>

59:12.415 --> 59:13.917
Isn't it better to take the Circular?

59:15.552 --> 59:16.860
I think it might be backed up.

59:32.835 --> 59:33.677
Miss Seo.

59:34.103 --> 59:34.774
Yes, sir.

59:35.538 --> 59:37.279
Take the Circular,
even if it is backed up.

59:37.640 --> 59:38.311
Sir?

59:38.474 --> 59:39.509
Do as I say.

59:43.446 --> 59:44.083
Go.

59:55.258 --> 59:56.896
We're on Circular, sir.

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:10.348
You're taking a .45 to a meeting?

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:18.921
Do you think...

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.992
you can get rid of me?

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.493
Aren't you worried about her?

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.878
The approval come through?

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:40.335
Let's drop it here, Eun-hui.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.092
Seq!

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:15.901
Hello?

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:18.478
Listen to me carefully.

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:20.776
They know about you.

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:24.881
The company knows that you're alive.

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:27.153
Where are you?

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:28.555
It's your son.

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:30.888
Hello?

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.258
Take a right from there.

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:34.824
What's the matter with you?

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:40.192
Mom?

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.269
What's going on?

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:47.841
Where are you taking us?

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:50.637
Where are we going?

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:54.311
Stop the car.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.242
Stop the car right now!

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.216
Just calm down!

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:19.800
What are you gonna do now?

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.740
I'm going to Seoul
first thing in the morning.

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:26.272
Are you going to
take out the company?

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:29.741
What have they done?

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.885
Can't blame them for your screw-ups.

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:37.320
- But you...
- I didn't stir up trouble like you.

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.094
What business you have in Seoul?

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:48.000
I got some money stashed away.

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:52.672
You have to go get it?
Is it all cash?

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:54.400
Yeah.

01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:57.209
Take my car.

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:03.478
It's too flashy.

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:05.453
What are you gonna do with the money?

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:09.182
Maybe open a cafe or something.

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:11.390
A cafe?

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.191
How long have you
been thinking about this?

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:18.823
I don't know.

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:22.799
It just happened.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:26.636
Hyeong-do.

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:32.509
There is nothing for you
after you quit.

01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:45.020
<i>Hun wasn't in a ca! accident,
was he?</i>

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:48.288
Tell me.

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:51.423
Just tell me, please!

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:55.497
Do you really want to know?

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:04.376
From the outside,

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.981
our company is an ordinary
metal manufacturer

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:15.114
but the team I work for...

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.594
It was just work, mom.

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:34.472
What was I supposed to do?

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:38.235
How else was I going to
take care of you?

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:45.413
Just work? You murdered...

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:48.318
I couldn't stand
your endless coughing.

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:39.071
<i>You know my life has always
been devoted to my work.</i>

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:45.171
<i>To this day, the company
was everything to me.</i>

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:49.215
<i>It was my school and my home.</i>

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:54.912
<i>My entire life revolved
around the company.</i>

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.249
<i>Nothing more nothing less.</i>

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:02.825
<i>I could never imagine leaving it</i>

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:10.465
<i>nor did I want to cause trouble</i>
<i>for my colleagues.</i>

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:15.968
<i>I'm terribly sorry that
things turned out this way.</i>

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:19.640
<i>I won't ask for your understanding.</i>

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:22.879
<i>Just...</i>

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.117
<i>I just...</i>

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:33.121
<i>want you to leave me alone.</i>

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:37.256
You've been killing people all your life.

01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:39.291
A fresh start?

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:43.728
Why are you doing this?

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:48.189
You're trying to get out

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:53.035
and I'm trying to get back in.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:58.843
This is what I gotta do
to get back.

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:07.712
Didn't I tell you

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.120
that company men like us

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:16.055
should stick it out to the end?

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.388
Remember?

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:23.197
Gwon promised to take me back.

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:29.874
Take the money. It's all yours.

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:34.377
You don't know what to do
with your money, just like me.

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:39.317
Mr. Ban, please let them go.

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:40.212
Why?

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.024
Why would I do that?

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:56.033
I'm sorry for everything
that I've done.

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:58.067
Do whatever you want with me.

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:03.471
But please let them go.

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:11.180
Watch carefully.

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.414
This is all on you.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.314
Mom... mom...

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:33.476
Sweetheart, forgot something?

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:55.942
<i>[URGENT] Check intranet notice</i>

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:34.076
Hold the elevator.

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:38.976
I'm in a bit of a rush.

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.320
Nice vest.

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:01.075
Where is the chairman?

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:02.602
Mr. Ji!

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:47.052
Hyeong-do.

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:49.651
Let's not do it like this, man.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.517
Swallow your pride and stick it out.
Don't we all?

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:03.503
Mr. Ji, the chairman is not here.

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:14.532
Mr. Gu!

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:17.332
Miss Park!

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:42.219
Call it a day.

01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:47.259
I have no idea what
you want with me now.

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:49.961
Let's put all this behind us.

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:53.059
I've had my share of trouble
thanks to you.

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:55.067
There was a complaint about noise.

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:56.865
Suspected gun shot or something.

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:00.666
Hello?

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:03.405
Mr. Ji?

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:05.641
<i>Mr. Ji?</i>

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:15.346
Where is Mr. Gwon?

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:21.360
And, Mr. Chairman?

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.362
He must be in the storage room.

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:29.530
Sweetheart,
did you really have to do this?

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:31.702
I'm sorry.

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:34.899
Not that I don't understand you

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.842
but we all have families to feed.

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.613
I'm in a tight spot because of
my youngesfs tuition fee...

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:24.620
Easy, tiger.

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:42.031
I can't believe this company
is going down like this.

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:51.173
Forget it.
We have too many bodies.

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.082
What, son?

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:02.148
I want to quit.

01:23:04.212 --> 01:23:07.250
We're done.
What are you talking about?

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:12.656
I said I want out!

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:44.157
You were the only one in the company...

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:47.760
thatl had big hopes for.

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:50.766
But...

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:54.773
Look at us now.

01:23:58.299 --> 01:23:59.369
What hopes?

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:03.812
Huh?

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.614
- Hopes for what?
- Forget it.

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:11.888
Walk away.

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:38.413
Get out of here.

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:41.251
What about you?

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.688
Don't take the elevator.

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:51.221
Take the fire escape to 15th floor.

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:53.998
There is a janitor's closet.

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:57.892
Get changed there

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:00.406
and wait for my signal.

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:07.442
Fucking bastard!

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:13.677
Son of a bitch!

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:18.222
Does it h u rt?

01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:22.885
I'm asking you.

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.527
Huh? Huh?

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:31.798
Answer me for once.

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:38.441
What's the reason?

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:39.570
Huh?

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:45.209
What?

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:49.444
If you don't get it,
you don't get it.

01:25:53.948 --> 01:25:54.790
Son of a bitch!

01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:01.696
You bastard!

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:06.704
Fucking piece of shit...

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:10.770
Let go, motherfucker!

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:14.202
You're ruining my suit.

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:16.680
For fuck's sake.

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:18.246
Do you like your job?

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:19.545
Crazy motherfucker!

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:23.282
Who in the world likes their job?

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:28.057
I said do you like your job?

01:27:16.264 --> 01:27:17.004
The company!

01:27:37.385 --> 01:27:38.090
Hun.

01:27:40.154 --> 01:27:43.829
Listen to me carefully.

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:49.598
You can live.

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:52.838
You...

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.408
gotta live.

01:28:01.976 --> 01:28:02.579
Why?

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:09.022
Because you deserve it.

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:19.063
Meet someone you love.

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:22.772
And live your life

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:27.111
happily.
