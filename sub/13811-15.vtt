01:23.124 --> 01:25.335
Otto, are you okay?

01:25.418 --> 01:28.713
{\an1}Yeah, I'm cool,
but my bike is toast.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.256
Oh, you know
what they say:

01:30.340 --> 01:31.424
"Haste makes waste."

01:31.508 --> 01:34.677
Yeah, it also makes
one gnarly wipeout.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.763
Man, this is the lamest.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.515
My bike's all busted

01:38.598 --> 01:43.228
and the Mad Town Free-style
contest starts in an hour.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.396
(<i> humming</i> )

01:45.480 --> 01:48.107
Unless...

01:48.191 --> 01:50.610
Hey, Mr. Stimpleton.

01:50.693 --> 01:53.530
{\an5}Wow, that's
some good work
you're doing there.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.406
Hmm.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.408
Unusually polite and respectful.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.202
Must mean you need something.

01:59.285 --> 01:59.702
What is it, Rocket?

01:59.786 --> 02:01.830
{\an3}Well...

02:01.913 --> 02:03.790
I kind of broke the gooseneck
on my bike

02:03.873 --> 02:05.083
and there's sort of this contest

02:05.166 --> 02:08.002
that's about to start,
and, well, um...

02:08.086 --> 02:10.547
I suppose you want me
to drop what I'm doing

02:10.630 --> 02:12.382
{\an1}and fix your
little bike there.

02:12.465 --> 02:12.841
Yes, sir.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.927
Okay.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.512
Okay! All right!

02:17.595 --> 02:19.806
Whoo, thanks, Merv--

02:19.889 --> 02:21.724
I mean,
Mr. Stimpleton, sir.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.060
But now you owe me one.

02:24.143 --> 02:26.729
Whenever you need
something, let me know.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.982
Okay, then, it's a deal.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.904
Otto:
What a perfect weekend.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.866
First, I win this sweet trophy.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.910
{\an5}And tomorrow we
go to the extreme
sports thingy

02:40.994 --> 02:41.828
at the convention center.

02:41.911 --> 02:45.081
I can't wait for that.

02:45.164 --> 02:46.374
Neither can I.

{\an4}Merv:
Come on, young Rocket,
rise and shine!

02:56.384 --> 02:59.095
Man, huh?
What's going on out there?

02:59.178 --> 03:01.848
Up and at 'em, Rocket boy.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.099
Huh?
What are you talking about?

03:03.182 --> 03:05.768
Merv said
you promised him a favor

03:05.852 --> 03:07.312
for fixing your bike yesterday.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.104
So?

03:08.187 --> 03:09.314
So he wants you to be

03:09.397 --> 03:10.565
his golf caddie today.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.775
Well, that's obviously
not happening.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.820
I'm going to the Extreme Sports
Convention today.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.865
(<i> car engine starts</i> )

03:21.200 --> 03:23.953
All right, you guys,
let's head out.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.414
I guess this all leaves you

03:26.497 --> 03:29.125
with an extra ticket
to the convention, huh?

03:29.208 --> 03:31.461
Well, I suppose.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.463
Well, good!
I'd be more than happy

03:33.546 --> 03:34.964
to take it off your hands.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.299
Let's get-a-goin'!

03:39.385 --> 03:43.264
Now, Rocket, the thing
to remember about golf

03:43.348 --> 03:45.058
is that it
requires focus

03:45.141 --> 03:47.644
and concentration.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.313
It all started in Scotland

03:50.396 --> 03:52.690
sometime close
to 1457,

03:52.774 --> 03:57.153
Which reminds me
of a humorous golf anecdote.

03:59.405 --> 04:03.368
Now, remember,
if anyone gets lost,

04:03.451 --> 04:05.411
we're going to meet
back here at... Huh?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.087
{\an3}Driver.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.880
{\an1}You're not in a car,
Mr. Stimpleton.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.091
No...

04:18.173 --> 04:19.926
driver!

04:20.009 --> 04:22.512
That big stick
with a one on it.

04:25.515 --> 04:29.018
Now, watch and learn,
young Rocket.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.561
Watch and learn what?

04:30.645 --> 04:33.231
{\an3}Shh!

04:34.065 --> 04:37.485
(<i> humming</i> )

04:46.744 --> 04:48.413
(<i> grunts</i> )

04:50.456 --> 04:52.375
Oh, there's a beauty.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.627
Let's roll, caddie!

04:54.711 --> 04:57.046
Dude, the ball's right there.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.715
We can walk to it.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.466
I said let's roll.

05:03.302 --> 05:06.389
At least driving
will be cool.

05:07.265 --> 05:11.060
Whoa! Too fast! Too fast!

05:11.144 --> 05:13.187
{\an1}Course regulations
specifically state "no vehicles

05:13.271 --> 05:17.734
{\an1}shall travel over
two miles an hour."

05:17.817 --> 05:20.111
It's going to be a long day.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.405
They got to be
around here somewhere.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.449
If I could find
the information booth,

05:24.532 --> 05:27.243
I could have them paged
over the loudspeaker.

05:27.326 --> 05:30.663
(<i> screaming</i> )

05:34.334 --> 05:36.794
(<i> groans</i> )

05:36.878 --> 05:37.920
Oh!

05:38.004 --> 05:41.174
Hey, what happened
to Mrs. Stimpleton?

05:41.257 --> 05:44.510
Maybe she got bored of
watching us and left.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.179
All right!

05:46.262 --> 05:47.722
Whee!

05:47.805 --> 05:49.098
(<i> laughing</i> )

05:49.182 --> 05:50.975
Yow-whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:51.059 --> 05:51.601
{\an3}No way.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.519
{\an1}Whoa!

05:53.603 --> 05:55.063
All:
Go, Mrs. Stimpleton!

05:55.146 --> 05:57.774
That looks promising.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.447
Huh?

06:05.114 --> 06:08.534
(<i> grunting</i> )

06:13.414 --> 06:14.916
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:14.999 --> 06:15.875
Ticket?

06:15.958 --> 06:16.626
I already paid.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.252
I stepped outside by mistake.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.880
Did I ask for
your life story

06:20.963 --> 06:22.298
or did I ask
for a ticket?

06:22.381 --> 06:24.175
{\an1}Uh, a ticket,
I guess, but...

06:24.258 --> 06:26.677
Then get to stepping.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.228
(<i> sighs</i> )

06:48.449 --> 06:49.492
Finally.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.701
You think you could
drop me off

06:50.785 --> 06:52.954
at the sports convention
on our way home?

06:53.037 --> 06:56.290
Home? We've got
17 more holes to play.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.500
17?!

06:57.583 --> 06:59.168
To the next hole, caddie,

06:59.252 --> 07:01.546
and slowly.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.339
(<i> groans</i> )

07:05.424 --> 07:06.008
Yeah!

07:06.092 --> 07:08.136
Yeah, all right!

07:08.219 --> 07:10.513
{\an1}I got to get one of these
for my bedroom.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.558
(<i> cheering</i> )

07:13.641 --> 07:15.017
You know how to smoothboard?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.895
Do a fakie board grip?

07:17.979 --> 07:19.313
Is that what that was?

07:19.397 --> 07:21.524
I thought that felt fancy.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.318
I'm just going to have

07:24.402 --> 07:25.486
to take a penalty

07:25.570 --> 07:26.154
and move the ball myself.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.364
Golf is the lamest.

07:28.447 --> 07:31.367
{\an1}You just don't understand
the game, young Rocket.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.619
Takes forever for
anything to happen.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.705
As soon as it gets tough,
you wimp out

07:35.788 --> 07:36.956
and you got to make sure

07:37.039 --> 07:38.666
the caddie is bored
at all times.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.376
(<i> grumbling</i> ):
D-D-Driver...

07:40.459 --> 07:44.255
Bored?
B-B-B-Bored at all times?!

07:44.338 --> 07:45.381
W-Wimp out!

07:45.464 --> 07:47.425
Why you...

07:47.508 --> 07:49.260
(<i> yelling</i> )

07:53.347 --> 07:55.975
How's that for
wimping out?

07:56.058 --> 07:57.935
That was awesome.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.687
You fully went for it.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.105
That's right, I...

08:01.189 --> 08:03.566
Sweet mother of corn.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.152
I made it to the green.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.236
See, dude?

08:07.320 --> 08:07.945
No wimping out!

08:08.029 --> 08:11.324
Yeah, no wimping out!

08:11.407 --> 08:12.992
Ha, ha! Step on it!

08:13.075 --> 08:14.368
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

08:14.452 --> 08:16.412
-All right!
-Yeah!

08:16.495 --> 08:17.747
Uh, excuse me.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.917
Could you tell me where
the information booth is?

08:22.877 --> 08:25.004
Thanks.

08:26.088 --> 08:28.090
What?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.259
W-W-Wait a minute!

08:30.343 --> 08:32.135
(<i> pounding on door</i> )

08:41.854 --> 08:43.731
Go for it!

08:50.821 --> 08:54.617
This is awesome!

08:54.700 --> 08:57.703
Yeah, I'm feeling
rather awestruck myself.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.840
Whoo, I haven't felt this way
in years.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.218
You kids want to come back
tomorrow?

09:12.301 --> 09:14.929
Mrs. Stimpleton, you rule.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.269
Hmm. You think

09:21.352 --> 09:23.312
you can sink this
one, young Rocket?

09:23.396 --> 09:26.023
Yeah.
It's as good as sunk.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.692
Yeah!

09:30.111 --> 09:32.655
Aw, man.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.992
{\an1}Remember, Rocket, in golf,
there's a time to go forward,

09:36.075 --> 09:39.328
but there's also a time
for concentration and focus.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.580
It's called... patience.

09:41.664 --> 09:42.540
Here.

09:42.623 --> 09:45.126
Try it again.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.304
Yeah! That was sweet.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.682
You see, my boy?
Patience.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.142
Yeah, all right!

10:01.225 --> 10:05.146
And now we go for it!

10:06.272 --> 10:07.106
Out of the way,

10:07.189 --> 10:10.359
you old nippers!

10:14.280 --> 10:17.199
Okay... according to this map,

10:17.283 --> 10:19.160
the information office
should be

10:19.243 --> 10:21.704
right over here.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.962
What?

10:30.046 --> 10:33.215
I'll just wait by the car.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.010
Oh, best score ever!

10:36.093 --> 10:40.222
And I didn't wimp out
and pick up the ball once!

10:40.306 --> 10:44.810
From now on, my motto is
"Go for it!"

10:44.894 --> 10:47.897
{\an1}Yeah, Mr. Stimpleton,
I guess golf's

10:47.980 --> 10:48.481
not as lame as I thought.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.567
Indeed, it's not.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.527
And call me dude.

10:53.611 --> 10:53.819
(<i> chuckles</i> )

11:07.750 --> 11:08.918
{\an3}Otto, man,

11:09.001 --> 11:11.045
you missed the most awesome
convention ever.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.714
It's cool.
I'll make it next time.

11:15.841 --> 11:16.801
Mmm...

11:31.732 --> 11:33.150
{\an6}All right!

11:31.732 --> 11:33.150
Yeah!

11:33.234 --> 11:34.276
No way!

11:34.360 --> 11:36.445
Wow, what do you call that?

11:36.529 --> 11:40.658
Patience, bro. Patience.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.410
{\an1}Awesome!

11:42.493 --> 11:43.869
Go for it, Merv.

11:43.953 --> 11:47.498
Ha, ha! You just try
and stop me, sweet-cheeks.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.709
I'm completely rad!

12:11.063 --> 12:13.816
Wh-Whoa!

12:13.899 --> 12:16.360
I don't know if I
could hold on.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.528
(<i> echoes</i> )
Hold on.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.280
We're coming
to get you, bro.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.531
(<i> echoes</i> )
Bro.

12:22.241 --> 12:22.825
(<i> grunting</i> )

12:22.908 --> 12:25.661
Hang on. We've got you.

12:25.744 --> 12:29.248
Just a little bit more.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.332
Whoa!

12:30.416 --> 12:31.792
Whoa!

12:37.840 --> 12:39.216
Come on, gang!

12:39.300 --> 12:41.510
I found the perfect spot
for lunch.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.262
{\an8}Last one to lunch
is a mountain dork!

12:43.345 --> 12:46.223
{\an8}(<i> panting</i> )

12:46.307 --> 12:48.392
Hey, wait a second.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.520
I'll be... right there.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.691
Got to get my asthma medicine.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.571
Oh, no! Empty.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.280
Hurry up, Squid!

13:01.363 --> 13:03.782
(<i> wheezing</i> )

13:03.866 --> 13:07.745
You mean "Hurry up,
mountain dork."

13:07.828 --> 13:09.997
(<i> laughing</i> )

13:10.080 --> 13:13.751
(<i> gasping and wheezing</i> )

13:13.834 --> 13:15.419
Sam, what's wrong?

13:15.503 --> 13:21.383
Mr. Rocket... I think I need
to go to the hospital.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.386
(<i> siren wailing</i> )

13:24.470 --> 13:25.679
(<i> loud growling</i> )

13:25.763 --> 13:30.059
Dude,
my heart is growling.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.728
{\an5}(<i> loud throbbing</i> )

13:30.142 --> 13:32.728
I can't believe it.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.438
{\an3}Sam's had asthma before,
and it was never like this.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.900
I know. Really scary.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.068
Great news, gang.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.736
Sam's doing fine.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.404
He gets to go home
in a little bit.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.698
That is so cool.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.535
Come on, you can come back
and say a quick hello.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.747
Here's your
clothes, honey.

13:51.830 --> 13:52.748
(<i> door opens</i> )

13:52.831 --> 13:54.250
(<i> door shuts</i> )

13:57.378 --> 13:59.922
Right in here. Hoo!

14:00.005 --> 14:01.465
Hey, Sam-my.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.259
Nice moon, Squid!

14:03.342 --> 14:04.593
Bust!

14:04.677 --> 14:05.928
Oops.

14:06.011 --> 14:06.428
(<i> laughs sheepishly</i> )

14:06.512 --> 14:07.596
Hey, guys!

14:07.680 --> 14:09.473
Sorry about ruining the trip.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.766
Don't worry about it.

14:10.849 --> 14:13.394
We're just glad
you're better.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.395
Yeah, no problemo.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.939
So you get to come home now,
huh?

14:17.022 --> 14:20.192
Yup, and the doc says I can
be back in action tomorrow

14:20.276 --> 14:21.443
ready to tear it up.

14:21.527 --> 14:25.531
Really? Uh, well,
that's great.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.623
Looks like
another primo session.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.793
{\an1}I can't stop thinking
about Sam's asthma attack.

14:37.876 --> 14:39.712
It was so freaky.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.964
Yeah. I'm glad
Raymundo was around.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.800
What if it had happened
when it was just us?

14:44.883 --> 14:47.636
Bro, I don't even want
to think about it.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.971
(<i> sighs</i> )

14:49.054 --> 14:50.931
Too late. I'm thinking about it.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.978
What is the Squid
doing here?

14:56.061 --> 14:58.147
I thought he'd
be home resting.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.483
Well, he's here, so we got to
take it easy with him, okay?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.736
We don't want him
getting sick again.

15:03.819 --> 15:04.737
{\an3}Hey, guys!

15:04.820 --> 15:06.530
Hey, Squid,
welcome back.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.365
Are you feeling okay?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.284
"Okay"? I'm stoked.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.119
Since I got home
from the hospital,

15:12.202 --> 15:14.204
all I thought about
was surfing with you guys.

15:14.288 --> 15:18.834
{\an1}Surfing? Otto was thinking
maybe we'd play a round

15:18.917 --> 15:20.252
of video games
at the arcade.

15:20.336 --> 15:20.836
{\an3}I what?

15:20.919 --> 15:23.339
Plus, it'll be nice

15:23.422 --> 15:24.590
{\an1}to do something different
for a change.

15:24.673 --> 15:28.052
Well, I <i> was</i> looking forward
to the waves

15:28.135 --> 15:31.221
but I'm always up
for a good video game.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.560
And he's setting
a new world record!

15:36.644 --> 15:38.854
(<i> whirring and beeping</i> )

15:38.937 --> 15:43.067
{\an3}If I'm going to ski,
I want to ski on real snow.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.402
Who's that team?

15:45.486 --> 15:46.945
Wasn't that great?

15:47.029 --> 15:48.489
I never knew you guys
like to do this stuff.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.784
Neither did we.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.206
Wha... oh!

15:57.289 --> 15:59.333
{\an1}Huh.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.460
Awesome pass, Reg.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.713
Remember Sam's asthma.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.383
Don't worry. I'm all
set for an emergency.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.470
{\an5}I wrote down every
doctor and hospital
number in Ocean Shores.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.057
One goalie reporting for duty,
sir.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.060
{\an1}Uh-um... we're not doing
hockey, uh, Reggie.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.938
{\an1}Why don't you tell him
what we're doing?

16:21.021 --> 16:26.735
{\an5}Yeah. You know,
about the thing
and the thingy...

16:26.819 --> 16:30.030
Oh, right.

16:30.114 --> 16:34.785
See, we, uh, just invented
a new game, and i-it's called...

16:34.868 --> 16:37.413
walkey instead of hockey.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.665
Yeah, walkey, right.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.291
It's pretty cool.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.836
You walk the court
instead of skate.

16:43.919 --> 16:44.169
I'll show you.

16:47.214 --> 16:50.259
See, see, walk this way,
walkey, already.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.468
{\an1}...slow,
got to go.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.262
Well, you know me.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.055
I'm up for anything.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.394
Yeah, whoo-hoo-hoo!

17:00.477 --> 17:01.562
Tear it up!

17:01.645 --> 17:05.523
Cool, I'm totally up
for a little boarding.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.777
Whoo, man! I missed this.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.280
{\an5}Sure is better than the lame
activities we have to do
for Sam.

17:11.363 --> 17:15.742
{\an4}Yeah, and we don't have
to worry about him getting sick.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.369
Come on, guys,
it's not fair.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.415
I knew there's no such thing
as walkey.

17:21.498 --> 17:26.086
Besides, how can anyone who uses
one of these be extreme anyway?

17:29.965 --> 17:31.425
{\an3}Hey, Squid.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.426
Hey, guys.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.888
Oh, man, how are we
going to make up...?

17:35.971 --> 17:39.516
Uh, guys, listen,
I have some great news.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.019
My dad called and
asked me to help him

17:42.102 --> 17:44.188
{\an5}on a really rad
computer project
via e-mail,

17:44.271 --> 17:48.317
and the thing is, it's
going to take up a lot of time.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.319
So I probably won't be able

17:50.402 --> 17:52.237
to hang out with you guys
for a while.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.573
Well, that's awesome!

17:54.656 --> 17:56.950
I... mean, for <i> you.</i>

17:57.034 --> 17:59.995
{\an1}Yeah, awesome
for you, totally.

18:00.078 --> 18:01.830
Congratulations, Sammy.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.666
Well, maybe I'll catch you guys
at the Shack sometime.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.294
Working guys got to eat.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.213
Yeah, sure thing.

18:09.296 --> 18:11.006
Yup, great.

18:11.089 --> 18:12.174
{\an1}For sure.

18:12.257 --> 18:16.136
Okay, then. So... later.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.847
Yup, yup, yup.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.849
We are off the hook.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.936
No more lame old games.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.438
Won't be needing this
anymore.

18:26.522 --> 18:30.859
Guys, Sammy's going to be doing
what he likes to do.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.610
So, that's good, right?

18:31.693 --> 18:34.029
Of course it's good.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.114
It's all good!

18:41.745 --> 18:43.872
Whoa!

18:43.956 --> 18:46.542
{\an1}That was, like,
the best wave ever.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.710
Totally, all the time.

18:48.794 --> 18:55.050
Squid sure will love that one,
even after he beefed

19:02.474 --> 19:03.934
It's my favorite shot.

19:04.017 --> 19:04.434
Get ready.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.020
{\an3}Yeah!

19:11.817 --> 19:13.360
What are you doing?

19:13.443 --> 19:14.403
I was trying
to get the puck.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.406
A goalie's job is
to block the puck.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.241
Well, I'm tired of being goalie.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.076
All he does is guard the goal.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.661
Duh! Come on.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.831
{\an1}Squid's not here,
so we all got to take turns.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.588
Whoo-hoo!
Hold the applause,

19:32.671 --> 19:35.090
but, yes, I think
I broke my own record.

19:35.173 --> 19:37.426
Too bad
he can't shake it.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.678
Sam has all that stuff
on his computer.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.597
Oh, yeah.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.684
I miss the total lame
squidness of Squid.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.019
{\an1}Me, too.

19:47.102 --> 19:50.188
{\an1}Well, we can go
visit him, right?

19:50.272 --> 19:53.692
Great idea. Even if he's
swamped with his project,

19:53.775 --> 19:55.652
I'm sure he won't mind.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.532
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

20:01.575 --> 20:01.992
(<i> gasps</i> )

20:02.075 --> 20:02.951
Hi, guys.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.787
What are you doing here?

20:05.871 --> 20:08.999
Uh, just wanted to check
on our favorite Squid.

20:09.082 --> 20:11.335
Thanks, but I'm really busy

20:11.418 --> 20:14.421
whew, you know,
my project and all.

20:14.504 --> 20:15.380
Ooh, some project.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.675
Skateboarding in the
backyard all week.

20:18.759 --> 20:19.426
Wish I could

20:19.509 --> 20:22.596
{\an1}get a project
like that.

20:22.679 --> 20:26.058
Okay, I made up the thing
with my dad.

20:26.141 --> 20:28.560
I didn't want you guys
worrying about me being sick

20:28.644 --> 20:30.020
and ruining your fun.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.940
{\an1}Well, we were kind of
worried at first,

20:33.023 --> 20:35.275
{\an1}so we made up
those stupid games.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.695
{\an1}But we miss you,
and we want you to come back,

20:38.779 --> 20:40.322
just like old times.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.700
Yeah. We've got a hockey game
with Lars later.

20:43.784 --> 20:44.368
It's okay, guys.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.954
Maybe it's for the best.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.330
Any way you look at it,

20:48.413 --> 20:49.081
I'm still the Squid
with asthma.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.458
But you've always had it.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.920
Right. I always had,
and I always will.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.005
But, hey,
I'll see you guys around, okay?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.091
{\an1}O-kay.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.513
(<i> laughing</i> )

21:04.596 --> 21:05.889
Whoo! Scored again.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.683
Oh, what was that?

21:07.766 --> 21:09.017
Another goal?

21:09.101 --> 21:11.186
You ready
to quit yet?

21:11.269 --> 21:12.521
{\an3}Losers!

21:12.604 --> 21:13.689
(<i> laughing</i> )

21:13.772 --> 21:15.774
Man, this is weak.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.737
Oh, I thought you were hanging
out with your little friends.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.615
{\an1}I was going to leave you this
surprise on your dresser.

21:23.699 --> 21:24.408
What is it?

21:24.491 --> 21:26.618
It's a sports inhaler!

21:26.702 --> 21:29.705
{\an1}I mean, you're always doing
one extreme sport or another.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.290
{\an5}This way, it's right
there when you need it,
and you won't lose it.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.710
It's perfect for you,
right?

21:34.793 --> 21:36.253
Right.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.380
Perfect for me.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.345
{\an1}(<i> groans</i> )

21:45.429 --> 21:48.223
Did somebody
say forfeit?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.392
Not so fast!

21:52.310 --> 21:55.272
{\an1}Dude, I thought you weren't
going to hang with us.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.733
After you guys left,
I realized something.

21:57.816 --> 21:58.984
I've had asthma all my life.

21:59.067 --> 22:02.779
I'm not going to let one stupid
attack ruin everything.

22:02.863 --> 22:05.407
{\an5}Cool. Way to go, Sammy!

22:02.863 --> 22:05.407
Yeah!

22:05.490 --> 22:07.576
Get ready to rock!

22:12.372 --> 22:12.956
Hey, that was
supposed to be my pass.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.167
Look alive, lame-o!

22:15.250 --> 22:15.751
What are you doing?

22:15.834 --> 22:16.668
Wa-ha!

22:16.752 --> 22:18.420
Ahh!

22:18.503 --> 22:20.297
(<i> groaning</i> )

22:22.090 --> 22:24.426
Yes!

22:30.432 --> 22:31.475
Wh-aah!

22:31.558 --> 22:33.101
Wha-hoa!

22:34.519 --> 22:36.313
Way to go, Sammy!
Yeah!

22:36.396 --> 22:37.689
Yeah, whoo-hoo!

22:37.773 --> 22:39.357
(<i> wheezing</i> )

22:39.441 --> 22:40.942
Sammy, are you okay?

22:41.026 --> 22:42.277
(<i> gasping for air</i> )

22:42.360 --> 22:43.945
Just give me a sec.

22:45.655 --> 22:46.823
(<i> inhales sharply</i> )

22:46.907 --> 22:48.450
(<i> exhales</i> )

22:48.533 --> 22:52.120
One Squid ready for action.

(<i> chattering</i> )

22:56.375 --> 23:00.796
{\an8}(<i> rock music playing</i> )

23:38.291 --> 23:41.670
