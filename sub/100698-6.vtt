WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.253
[Ryn]
<i>Previously, on</i> Siren.

00:03.253 --> 00:05.214
The men always take the babies.
This is how it is done.

00:05.214 --> 00:06.924
[Helen] This child
is your people's hope.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.720
‐What is this?
‐I did a DNA test.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.263
‐On Helen?
‐Mm‐hm.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.973
‐Are you Rick?
‐Why?

00:14.973 --> 00:18.143
I saw that you were
looking for family.

00:18.143 --> 00:23.148
As of today, I have injected
myself with three doses.

00:23.148 --> 00:27.194
I've experienced the healing
of a deep wound.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.655
Acute hearing.

00:29.655 --> 00:30.989
Improved reflex.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.826
What are the limits?

00:34.826 --> 00:37.663
I saw Robb this morning.
He'd like to rent the warehouse.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.748
It's too risky
having someone in there,

00:39.748 --> 00:42.417
close to all of the stuff
we're working on.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.669
‐What?
‐Come on.

00:43.669 --> 00:44.962
[Robb]
Is there a weird smell in here?

00:44.962 --> 00:47.130
Something rotting.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.090
What is that?

00:49.299 --> 00:50.801
‐[gasps]
‐She sent me.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.177
Tia.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.512
[Ryn]
Some tried to fight.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.180
Katrina chooses Tia.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.475
She let me go to tell you,
come with her or die.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.893
Tia?

01:57.284 --> 01:59.786
Seriously, what was that?

02:05.208 --> 02:06.293
Maddie.

02:09.171 --> 02:12.049
Ben and I found it
washed up on shore.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.218
We couldn't identify it
as any known aquatic species,

02:15.218 --> 02:17.304
so we've been running tests,

02:17.304 --> 02:19.139
trying to figure out
more about it.

02:19.139 --> 02:23.977
Do you have a theory?
Is it a fish, or is it a mammal?

02:23.977 --> 02:26.188
No idea, but we're just
in the early stages.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.689
It just threw me.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.983
I didn't realize Ben
had moved it in here.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.068
[chuckles]

02:42.329 --> 02:46.249
As of now, I have given myself
five injections.

02:46.249 --> 02:51.046
My cardiovascular endurance
has improved.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.464
As of this morning,

02:52.464 --> 02:54.925
I can hold my breath underwater

02:54.925 --> 02:56.593
for ten minutes.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.804
My lung capacity
seems to have increased,

02:58.804 --> 03:00.639
as it did with my mother.

03:02.057 --> 03:05.519
Today, I doubled my dosage.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.855
The current batch
of stem cells is depleted.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.525
I'll need to extract more
from the specimen.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.443
Once I have,

03:13.443 --> 03:16.154
I'll continue to log
all my changes.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.629
No. No. No.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.631
No. What do you think, men?

03:34.631 --> 03:38.969
What do you think?
Classic fit, or modern?

03:38.969 --> 03:40.178
I don't know, man.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.180
What makes it modern?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.766
Xan, come on,
it's more tailored.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.976
All right?

03:45.976 --> 03:47.269
Next, lapel.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.687
Notch or peak.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.021
Then you choose the vents.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.231
Side vents, center vents,
no vents.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.816
It's countless combinations,

03:52.816 --> 03:54.526
and we haven't even got
into color or material.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.486
[laughs]
Okay.

03:56.486 --> 04:00.449
You definitely were not
a menswear expert two weeks ago.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.659
I mean, you popped the question
to Janine in a beanie.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.494
I've been reading up.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.330
Janine wants the wedding's theme
to be "beachy elegance."

04:07.330 --> 04:09.916
And this is the one choice
she's letting me make.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.251
It's a lot of pressure.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.629
Just...

04:14.629 --> 04:16.715
all right, come here,
come on.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.008
Close your eyes.

04:18.008 --> 04:19.301
What?

04:19.301 --> 04:21.261
All right.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.888
No, you're standing
in front of Janine.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.598
You're about
to say your vows.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.891
Now, look down.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.602
What kind of suit
are you wearing?

04:33.064 --> 04:34.900
Light‐gray linen.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.360
Classic cut.
Notch lapel.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.363
Center vent.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.199
All right.
There you go.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.117
That's why
you're my best man.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.912
Exactly.
Don't forget that.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.455
Hey, can you do
one more thing for me?

04:48.455 --> 04:49.915
‐Yeah, sure.
‐Could you go by town hall

04:49.915 --> 04:51.458
and file the event permit?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.668
I told Janine
I'd take care of it.

04:53.668 --> 04:57.422
Oh, oh, so technically that
would be me taking care of it.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.423
But, yeah.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.300
Yeah, sure. No worries.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.176
Thank you.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.605
[indistinct chatter]

05:14.981 --> 05:16.983
[baby laughs]

05:16.983 --> 05:19.402
Hey!

05:22.823 --> 05:24.366
[sugar granules rattling]

05:25.700 --> 05:27.994
[spoon clanging]

05:27.994 --> 05:29.496
I couldn't believe
what I was hearing.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.666
He was totally lying,
right to my face.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.584
[barista]
Sir, your latte.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.587
Thanks.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.428
[woman] Good morning.
How can I help you?

05:45.428 --> 05:47.389
Am I in the right place
for local birth records?

05:47.389 --> 05:48.890
Yes, sir.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.809
What about death
and marriage certificates?

05:50.809 --> 05:52.602
‐I can help you
with that as well.
‐Okay. Great.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.104
Let's start with
a birth certificate

05:54.104 --> 05:56.022
for a Rick Marzdan.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.566
Certainly.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.150
If you meet me
at the microfilm stand,

05:59.150 --> 06:00.902
I'll be over
in just a moment.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.583
I thought you should know,
Ted Pownall is here.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.961
Asking questions.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.522
[high‐pitched squeal]

06:51.494 --> 06:52.871
[hisses]

07:08.053 --> 07:10.138
Have you thought about
sharing that with anyone?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.890
A university
or research facility?

07:11.890 --> 07:14.059
You potentially got a brand‐new
species sitting in there.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.227
We want to conduct
the research ourselves.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.854
But with the right resources,

07:17.854 --> 07:20.231
they could help you
understand what you've got.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.609
We've heard stories
from friends in academia

07:22.609 --> 07:24.903
about sharing information
too soon.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.072
Expropriation of data,
things like that.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.573
Yes, of course.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.574
I get it.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.159
You need to be careful.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.912
It's just‐‐ It's exciting,

07:33.912 --> 07:36.331
knowing you probably have
a major discovery on your hands?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.999
Not sure I could be
so patient.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.794
Well, we'll share it
when the time is right.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.420
When we know more about it.

07:55.684 --> 07:56.976
Where is she?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.293
You're alive.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.586
We escaped.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.630
Did you see my baby?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.674
Still with males.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.801
[Eliza]
Katrina turned on us.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.636
She helps Tia now.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.722
Shows her where we hide.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.141
No place is safe
for us anymore.

08:36.141 --> 08:37.684
We saw many dead out there.

08:37.684 --> 08:38.977
[Eliza]
She rules our water now.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.187
Nowhere to go but land.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.691
[thunder rumbles]

08:47.152 --> 08:48.403
There's a storm coming.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.531
They are injured?

08:51.531 --> 08:54.325
Yes.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.660
How bad?

08:58.413 --> 09:00.248
It is not safe to stay here.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.834
She may find you.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.919
I will swim back alone
and bring a boat.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.629
Take you to town.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.090
The humans will help us.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.717
We will heal first,

09:10.717 --> 09:13.845
then prepare ourselves
for Tia's attacks.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.431
You stay here.
Protect them.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.111
‐[door opens]
‐Thank you.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.827
I got your message.
Something about Ted Pownall?

09:37.827 --> 09:40.497
He went to the Vital Records
Office this morning.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.248
Oh, for God's sake.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.168
He was asking the clerk
about birth certificates.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.753
How do you know this?

09:46.753 --> 09:48.421
One of our own
works there.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.423
She gave me the heads‐up.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.468
We have members of our community
working everywhere.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.221
They help us keep
an eye on things.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.639
Ha!

09:57.639 --> 09:59.516
What do you think
Ted's doing?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.392
He knows.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.186
About them?

10:03.186 --> 10:04.437
And us.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.272
How?

10:06.272 --> 10:09.901
He saw one
in the water.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.195
Up close and personal.

10:12.195 --> 10:15.615
He went overboard out
at Carson Sound two weeks ago.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.034
One of them attacked him,
nearly killed him.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.620
And what was his reaction?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.705
After his mind was blown?

10:22.705 --> 10:26.292
I think his visit to
the records office answers that.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.671
One of the birth certificates
he asked for was Rick's.

10:31.798 --> 10:35.135
The DNA test Elaine did.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.594
Have you warned him?

10:36.594 --> 10:38.680
I've tried to reach him.
He's at work.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.182
What does Ted want?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.351
Honestly, I'm not sure
he even knows.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.730
This is exactly
what we've been afraid of.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.774
[sighs]

10:49.774 --> 10:51.860
We need to assemble
at the ranch.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.695
I'll come with you.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.124
Xander.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.126
Mr. Pownall.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.586
‐Hey.
‐What are you doing here?

11:09.586 --> 11:12.922
Oh, I was just applying
for an event permit.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.799
It's Calvin's wedding.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.093
He's really taking advantage
of this whole "best man" thing.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.137
I heard he proposed
at the Anchor.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.722
Well, he was hoping
for a beach in Maui,

11:20.722 --> 11:22.599
but I guess it didn't exactly
work out that way.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.479
How are you doing?

11:28.479 --> 11:30.815
I'm all right.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.443
I've had a hell of a lot
to think about.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.777
Look, I understand
why no one told me,

11:34.777 --> 11:36.905
but I just keep thinking,

11:36.905 --> 11:40.783
maybe I could've done something
if I'd known sooner, you know?

11:42.160 --> 11:45.163
Maybe your dad
would still be around.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.498
Must've scared the hell
out of you, what happened.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.003
Yeah.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.422
You got to manage this thing,
Xander, before it's too late.

11:56.257 --> 11:59.010
That's why I joined
the Academy.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.929
That's good.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.264
We're going to need someone
on the inside

12:03.264 --> 12:04.724
who knows what
they're dealing with.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.854
They're not all bad,
you know?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.773
I mean, you met Ryn.
She's smart.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.733
She cares about
Ben and Maddie.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.860
She's practically
one of us.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.987
Just because
they look like us,

12:17.987 --> 12:19.489
doesn't mean
they're like us, Xander.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.823
It's a mistake
to trust them.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.826
You know that
more than anyone.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.329
I got to go.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.664
Stay in touch.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.719
One sec.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.931
[dialing]

12:44.931 --> 12:46.599
[cell phone vibrating]

12:49.143 --> 12:50.770
Maddie, what's up?

12:50.770 --> 12:54.816
In the warehouse,
why is that body in the freezer?

12:54.816 --> 12:55.984
What were you
doing in there?

12:55.984 --> 12:57.819
I was showing Robb the space.

12:57.819 --> 13:01.281
<i>He noticed a smell,</i>
<i>so we opened it.</i>

13:01.281 --> 13:03.825
What the hell, Maddie?

13:03.825 --> 13:05.827
I told you not to go in there.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.453
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

13:07.453 --> 13:09.831
What was I thinking?
What were you thinking?

13:09.831 --> 13:11.833
It's the one from the woods.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.085
<i>The one that died</i>
<i>in transition.</i>

13:14.085 --> 13:16.754
Ben, why did you dig it up?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.298
I needed more stem cells.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.217
‐For what?
‐To help my mother.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.469
I'm doing some research.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.263
<i>What did you tell him it was?</i>

13:25.263 --> 13:26.556
Just that we found it
on a beach

13:26.556 --> 13:28.016
and we're still running tests

13:28.016 --> 13:29.600
<i>to figure out what it is.</i>

13:29.600 --> 13:30.893
And he believed you?

13:30.893 --> 13:32.937
Yeah, I think so.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.026
That was a really bad move,
bringing him in there.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.695
As bad as digging up
a dead body?

13:40.695 --> 13:43.239
Look, if he starts
asking questions...

13:43.239 --> 13:44.741
Yeah, I'm handling it, okay?

13:52.081 --> 13:54.250
Hey.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.252
‐Everything okay?
‐Oh, yeah. Fine.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.795
I got a theory.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.380
‐Really?
‐Mm‐hm.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.007
Bristol Cove.

14:01.007 --> 14:04.218
Mermaid capital of the world.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.054
Yeah?

14:06.054 --> 14:07.847
And that thing in the freezer,

14:07.847 --> 14:11.893
it had hair, human skin,
but it was also aquatic.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.145
What if it's some
actual version of‐‐?

14:14.145 --> 14:15.688
Of a what?

14:15.688 --> 14:18.399
You know you sound insane,
right?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.152
[sighs]

14:21.152 --> 14:22.904
Yeah.

14:22.904 --> 14:27.116
But in a totally
charming way.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.660
Well, good. I'm glad you find
my insanity charming.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.455
[laughs]

14:32.455 --> 14:35.666
Would you mind if we just
didn't talk about it anymore?

14:37.627 --> 14:39.962
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make a joke out of it.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.507
No, it's fine. Really.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.967
I get this is serious research
you and Ben are doing together.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.219
You know what?
Let's just drop it, okay?

14:48.054 --> 14:50.640
Sure.

14:51.808 --> 14:52.809
It's no problem.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.743
Ben?

15:10.743 --> 15:12.328
‐[door closes]
‐Ryn.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.624
Hey, you okay?

15:16.624 --> 15:18.543
Tia and Katrina
have taken over our waters.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.419
They killed many of us.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.796
I'm so sorry.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.798
We found a group
that survived,

15:23.798 --> 15:25.967
hiding away on an island.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.970
But they are injured
and freezing.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.721
We need to rescue them
and bring them here

15:30.721 --> 15:32.640
before Tia finds them
and kills them all.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.225
Okay.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.393
We need a boat.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.659
You called Xander?

15:51.659 --> 15:53.411
Yeah.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.954
Might be dangerous.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.038
Could use his help.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.294
You know,
just once in a while,

16:01.294 --> 16:04.797
I wish you'd just, you know,
call me and have brunch.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.314
What's your plan now?

16:21.314 --> 16:23.524
I'll probably head
to San Francisco for a bit,

16:23.524 --> 16:26.319
have some strategy meetings,
get ready for our tests.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.112
Makes sense.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.453
I'm‐‐ I'm sorry.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.580
I know you were just
trying to help, and I'm‐‐

16:37.580 --> 16:39.123
It's okay.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.417
You and Ben,
you have your own research,

16:41.417 --> 16:43.920
and we're not there yet.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.176
Wait.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.137
Don't go.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.430
I want you to stay.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.146
There's more
I want to tell you.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.898
Maddie, I don't want you
to feel uncomfortable.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.316
It's okay. It is.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.322
There's more than just
what you saw in the freezer.

17:11.322 --> 17:15.117
And maybe if I showed you,
it would help.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.207
[sizzling]

17:27.129 --> 17:29.465
Rick, customer out front
wants you.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.144
You looking for me?

17:44.188 --> 17:45.439
Rick Marzdan?

17:45.439 --> 17:46.732
Yeah.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.734
Ted Pownall.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.697
Please, have a seat.

17:58.119 --> 18:01.163
[Xander]
She's taking over your waters,

18:01.163 --> 18:02.665
this new one?

18:02.665 --> 18:04.333
Yes.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.461
And, what, basically
killing anyone

18:07.461 --> 18:08.963
that doesn't agree
with her?

18:22.310 --> 18:24.186
Xan, can you take over
for a sec?

18:25.313 --> 18:26.647
Yeah, I got you.

18:34.905 --> 18:39.201
My baby is out there somewhere,
far away.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.663
Look, I'm sure she's safe.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.458
Levi said that he'd
protect her with his life.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.336
I know she is safe.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.670
Peaceful.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.799
How do you know?

18:53.799 --> 18:55.968
I feel her heartbeat.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.306
Steady. Calm.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.849
You can feel it?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.517
Yes.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.645
In here.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.065
[heartbeat]

19:09.065 --> 19:10.775
That's your heartbeat.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.239
She is hope for all of us.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.825
A better life.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.626
Thank you.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.130
There is something
I can help you with?

19:33.130 --> 19:36.133
I came across your name
on a DNA test.

19:37.635 --> 19:38.636
The same one Helen saw.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.931
You and I are related as well.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.433
I know the truth

19:44.433 --> 19:45.434
about you and Helen.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.519
What you are.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.189
I have questions.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.873
This way.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.044
Xan, be ready.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.936
We brought a boat.
We must go, quickly.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.025
Don't worry, okay?

20:35.025 --> 20:37.528
We're on the same team
this time.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.326
[grunts]

20:46.328 --> 20:48.164
‐[man] Look out!
‐Go.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.126
[Xander]
Stay low. Stay low.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.464
[hisses]

21:23.282 --> 21:24.492
Put these on.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.294
Okay, okay.
It's Katrina and six others.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.505
They're blocking the way
back to the boat.

21:37.505 --> 21:41.467
Xander, you,
Cami and Eliza wait here.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.844
Ryn, Hunter, and I
will distract them.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.055
What‐‐ Then what?

21:46.055 --> 21:47.932
As soon as the coast is clear,

21:47.932 --> 21:49.934
you get them back to the boat
as fast as you can, okay?

21:49.934 --> 21:52.353
‐Okay.
‐You ready?

21:52.353 --> 21:53.354
Let's go.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.863
Hey!

22:05.032 --> 22:06.700
Kill them.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.925
[indistinct chatter]

22:24.635 --> 22:27.263
Thanks for helping, Helen.

22:27.263 --> 22:30.808
It's the right thing,
making them all aware.

22:30.808 --> 22:33.143
They're sitting ducks
otherwise.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.771
There you are.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.815
Ricky, I've been
trying to reach you.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.608
[Helen]
Is everything okay?

22:39.608 --> 22:43.445
Ted Pownall showed up
looking for me at the café.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.697
‐Oh, hell.
‐He...

22:47.324 --> 22:49.159
He means to make
trouble for us.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.328
Yeah, he was asking
a lot of questions.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.497
About what? The family?

22:53.497 --> 22:56.333
Yeah, but don't worry about it.
I handled it.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.711
Ted loves to be handled.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.462
What did he want to know?

23:00.462 --> 23:03.841
How many distant relatives,
there were like us.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.342
[Helen]
What'd you tell him?

23:05.342 --> 23:07.595
Nothing. Look, it's cool.
He just‐‐

23:07.595 --> 23:09.680
He doesn't want the secret
to come out.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.600
You know, the old stories
about the Pownall family.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.351
They don't want to look
like the bad guys.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.103
Appearance is everything.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.105
I told him it's fine.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.274
We've been keeping this secret
for over a hundred years.

23:20.274 --> 23:21.901
Well, that's good, Ricky.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.736
[Helen] That's exactly
what I told him too.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.321
He seemed relieved.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.906
So I told him
that there's a place

23:26.906 --> 23:29.408
that we get together
on a regular basis,

23:29.408 --> 23:31.493
and if there's ever a problem,
we'd gather here

23:31.493 --> 23:32.870
and stay out of the fray.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.496
You told him
about this place?

23:37.207 --> 23:38.584
[panting]

23:58.812 --> 24:00.564
[breathing heavily]

24:06.362 --> 24:08.697

I can give it a minute,
make sure they're gone.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.993
[exhales]
Okay.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.329
Hey, now you and me,

24:15.329 --> 24:18.457
we leave the past
in the past, yeah?

24:20.542 --> 24:21.543
We go?

24:26.298 --> 24:28.425
All right.
Coast is clear.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.762
Come on.

24:31.762 --> 24:33.138
The boat's not far.

26:12.863 --> 26:14.406
Now we are good.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.786
All right. Let's go.

[Robb] I wouldn't have
taken you for a spelunker.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.763
Ben and I were exploring,

27:19.763 --> 27:21.682
and stumbled
across this place.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.269
What is it?

27:25.269 --> 27:26.854
A cenote?

27:26.854 --> 27:28.730
Might have been.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.691
But look what we found.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.991
Some kind of language.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.243
How old is this place?

27:41.243 --> 27:42.703
Hard to say.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.746
Paleolithic?

27:44.746 --> 27:47.499
Maybe later.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.459
Cenozoic, we think.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.795
Look, over here as well.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.217
They don't match
an alphabet or symbols

27:57.217 --> 28:00.137
from any land‐dwelling species.

28:00.137 --> 28:03.640
I mean, not one
that we've found so far.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.397
It looks like based on
its calcification and fossils,

28:10.397 --> 28:13.692
we think this whole cave
used to be underwater.

28:15.110 --> 28:18.780
So you think the aquatic
species you discovered

28:18.780 --> 28:21.241
might have
a written language?

28:21.241 --> 28:23.493
It's a working theory.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.915
I mean, what if‐‐

28:27.915 --> 28:30.167
What if this species...

28:30.167 --> 28:33.837
What if it's intelligent
and evolved?

28:33.837 --> 28:35.172
Like humans?

28:38.884 --> 28:40.636
[sighs]

28:49.353 --> 28:52.439
Now I get why
you've been so cagey.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.858
It's a lot to process,
I know.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.026
Yeah.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.907

There's one missing.

29:31.645 --> 29:32.938

29:32.938 --> 29:36.024
You are too weak to be leader.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.526

I am stronger than you.

you were lost.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.066

You became one of us.

to end this way.

You don't have to die.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.998

‐Ben!

31:56.998 --> 31:58.166

So is Katrina.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.004

32:03.004 --> 32:05.924
No, no, we have to go.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.885
Xander, go, go, go!

32:26.278 --> 32:28.697
[Robb]
So, this writing,

32:28.697 --> 32:30.532
what do you
think it means?

32:32.492 --> 32:36.079
A friend of ours who knows
about ancient languages

32:36.079 --> 32:41.126
said all these are expressing
harmony between species.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.628
Your friend?

32:43.628 --> 32:45.338
M‐M‐More like a colleague.

32:48.008 --> 32:49.885
I don't care
about any of this.

32:52.179 --> 32:54.055
You don't?

32:54.055 --> 32:58.059
What really matters to me
is that you brought me here.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.979
That you trusted me enough
to share it with me.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.276
I'll never breathe
a word of this to anyone.

33:06.276 --> 33:07.986
Promise.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.807
They'll be fine.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.147
Tia is getting stronger.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.066
More and more
are joining her.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.152
Many from my waters are dead.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.237
Or injured.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.993
I'm afraid, Ben.

33:59.829 --> 34:00.997
Me too.

34:49.421 --> 34:50.672
Who did this?

34:50.672 --> 34:52.841
The one you told us of.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.092
Ryn.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.305
Where is she now?

34:58.305 --> 34:59.931
Escaped.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.099
With the humans.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.443
[gasps]

35:13.278 --> 35:14.821

35:21.786 --> 35:22.954
Join me...

35:24.289 --> 35:25.624
and you will live.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.644
I thought I was helping,
telling him about this place.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.729
I swear.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.356
I know.

35:49.356 --> 35:53.360
The fact Ted came to you,
asking questions,

35:53.360 --> 35:55.695
means we need
to take him seriously.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.198
What do you think he'll do?

35:58.198 --> 35:59.366
I don't know.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.203
We need to keep
an eye on him,

36:03.203 --> 36:06.206
see what he has in mind.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.667
Whatever it is,
we'll be ready.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.423
[sighs]

36:17.258 --> 36:20.136
Try not to worry about Ted.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.805
I'll talk to him.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.685
I just texted Helen.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.853
She's heading home.
We can take them back there.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.112
That shit that happened
on that island,

36:37.112 --> 36:39.197
this shit is just
getting bigger, okay?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.449
I mean, they could
come to town next.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.410
Yeah. I know.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.165
I saw your dad earlier,

36:49.165 --> 36:50.750
and he's hell‐bent
on stopping these things.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.336
I mean, maybe he can
help us somehow.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.796
No.

36:54.796 --> 36:56.548
No, we don't want his help.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.674
Trust me.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.386
We can figure this out
on our own.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.698
You bow your head to me,

37:21.698 --> 37:24.117
but does that mean
I should trust you?

37:25.368 --> 37:27.620
Of course,
you want to live,

37:27.620 --> 37:30.290
so you say you'll be
loyal to me.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.333
Yet you fought for Ryn.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.335
So I ask again,

37:34.335 --> 37:36.463
why should I trust you?

37:36.463 --> 37:37.714
[breathing heavily]

37:39.507 --> 37:41.718
I know something.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.678
The most important thing to Ryn.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.349
She has a baby.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.021
Humans help her make it.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.318
It's one of ours?

37:59.819 --> 38:01.029
Yes.

38:02.572 --> 38:04.199
Where is it?

38:04.199 --> 38:06.493
In the water.

38:06.493 --> 38:07.702
With the males.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.432
Hey, can I help?

38:33.978 --> 38:35.355
Oh, it's heavy.

38:35.355 --> 38:36.773
What is it?

38:36.773 --> 38:38.149
Necessities.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.986
Cameras? Drones?

38:43.363 --> 38:44.531
Guns?

38:47.534 --> 38:50.328
No one steps on or off this
property without our knowing.

38:51.538 --> 38:54.040
Keep ourselves safe.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.708
No one else
is going to do it.

39:04.509 --> 39:05.635
Thank God you're okay.
Come in.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.681
What happened out there?

39:11.140 --> 39:12.809
We went to save my people,

39:12.809 --> 39:16.521
but Tia's tribe
attacked us.

39:16.521 --> 39:19.399
Hunter is dead.
So is Katrina.

39:19.399 --> 39:21.526
This new one,
she's getting stronger.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.611
She's trying to conquer
everything in her path.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.238
We need to do something.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.448
‐Okay. Like what?
‐[Ben] I don't know.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.619
What happened with Robb?

39:31.619 --> 39:33.413
It's all right.
He won't say anything.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.706
I trust him.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.915
Where is he?

39:35.915 --> 39:37.250
He's getting coffee.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.626
He's going
to be here soon.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.003
All right,
we should get out of here.

39:40.003 --> 39:41.796
I would like
to meet your Robb.

39:41.796 --> 39:44.757
Well, I'm sure he'd like
to meet you too, but...

39:44.757 --> 39:46.092
Maybe some other time.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.846

It's okay.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.974

Oh, sorry,
