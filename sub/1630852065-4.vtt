You ready for your
next galactic adventure, girl?

00:51.340 --> 00:53.465
-Ready as I'll ever be, Captain!
-[yelps]

00:53.548 --> 00:54.590
How long have you been there?

00:54.673 --> 00:58.090
Long enough to see you talking
to an inanimate object.

00:58.173 --> 01:00.756
Clear the way! Coming through!

01:02.965 --> 01:06.673
Oh, uh, yeah.
The Council said I can't keep it.

01:07.506 --> 01:09.131
[alien growls]

01:12.548 --> 01:14.715
Captain, I'm worried
the internal coupler line

01:14.798 --> 01:16.006
is dangerously close to--

01:16.090 --> 01:18.715
Not now, Chonies. Where's Ed?

01:18.798 --> 01:21.006
Did he fall asleep in the Hydrant?

01:21.090 --> 01:24.298
[grunts] No,
I didn't fall asleep anywhere.

01:24.881 --> 01:28.006
-[thud]
-[sniffs] Didn't shower anywhere either.

01:28.090 --> 01:31.506
Don't smell shame me! [grunts]

01:32.173 --> 01:34.298
Hi, Loaf, it's me, you.

01:34.881 --> 01:36.465
If you're listening to this,

01:36.548 --> 01:39.673
you're still alive
despite what that fortune cookie said!

01:39.756 --> 01:41.381
You're such a good boy!

01:42.090 --> 01:43.090
[yelps]

01:43.173 --> 01:44.215
It's just me.

01:44.298 --> 01:46.923
Oh, how reassuring!

01:47.006 --> 01:49.840
Don't stress. I just got off retraining.

01:49.923 --> 01:52.923
No funny business today.
We're going to follow protocol so hard,

01:53.006 --> 01:54.465
you won't even need to use this.

01:56.548 --> 01:58.381
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

01:58.465 --> 02:00.631
You should go get that. Protocol.

02:00.923 --> 02:01.923
Okay, bye.

Well, can't argue with me.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.840
Ah!

02:33.298 --> 02:34.798
Are you here for the tour, too?

02:34.881 --> 02:35.881
Oh, um,

02:35.965 --> 02:37.673
no, I... I work here.

02:37.756 --> 02:41.798
Oh, so you're our Tour Captain?
Totally charmed, dude!

02:42.381 --> 02:44.215
-Wait, you don't understand!
-I want to feed a space eel!

02:44.298 --> 02:45.381
I was looking for chips!

02:45.465 --> 02:47.548
-Can we steer the ship?
-...a misunderstanding here! Ooh!

[Loaf wails]

02:53.090 --> 02:54.465
[screams]

02:56.881 --> 02:58.840
Hey, Chelsea, Garbage here.

02:58.923 --> 03:01.756
I know you're not short of reasons
to be proud of me,

03:01.840 --> 03:06.381
but I heroically rescued
a stranded space dog named Kira.

03:06.465 --> 03:08.465
She's kinda terrifying,

03:09.048 --> 03:10.423
but in a cool way.

03:11.506 --> 03:14.006
P.R.A.T.S. never told us she was out here.
Weird, right?

03:14.090 --> 03:15.256
Did they tell you about her?

03:15.340 --> 03:19.715
Anyway, I'm about to fetch you
an awesome new planet.

03:19.798 --> 03:21.881
So, see you soon. Love you!

03:32.923 --> 03:34.673
-[Stella chuckles]
-[gasps] Wow.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.965
-Yes!
-Wow!

03:37.548 --> 03:39.881
Why is the sun being so loud?

03:40.631 --> 03:41.631
[Chonies] Oh!

03:42.923 --> 03:47.965
This planet's conditions appear suitable
for every Earth species.

03:48.756 --> 03:52.215
[gasps] Does that mean no more exploring?

03:52.298 --> 03:54.673
Yep. If this planet is the one,

03:54.756 --> 03:56.173
which it obviously is,

03:56.256 --> 03:58.006
then we can... [cries] ...finally,

03:58.090 --> 04:00.756
f... finally... I just...

04:00.840 --> 04:04.840
Like, I just can't believe it's really...
[cries]

04:05.715 --> 04:07.048
[sighs sadly]

04:11.048 --> 04:12.090
Okay, everyone!

04:12.173 --> 04:15.756
Get ready to fill your lungs
with the sweet summer air

04:15.840 --> 04:17.715
of our brand-new home!

04:18.256 --> 04:20.590
I mean, really breathe in the moment.

04:20.673 --> 04:23.215
[inhales, gags]

04:23.298 --> 04:26.965
[everyone gags]

04:27.590 --> 04:28.756

04:28.840 --> 04:31.298
Ugh! Oh! Oh!

04:32.381 --> 04:34.215
Raise the ramp! Raise the ramp!

04:35.381 --> 04:36.548
-It reeks!
-Oh... Oh, my--

04:37.048 --> 04:38.048
[groans in pain]

04:39.048 --> 04:40.673
Try to breathe through your mouths!

04:40.756 --> 04:41.923
Nope! Now I can taste it!

04:42.006 --> 04:44.006
-Try to breathe through your eyes!
-[Nomi groans] Okay. [belch]

04:44.090 --> 04:46.006
It smells like the leg-cast... [gags]

04:46.090 --> 04:48.090
...my owner wore for seven years

04:48.173 --> 04:50.090
so he could
continue collecting disability!

04:50.173 --> 04:54.215
Abandon planet! [gags]
Abandon planet! [groans]

04:54.423 --> 04:55.923
Guys! If the smell is... [gags]

04:56.006 --> 04:57.673
the only issue,

04:57.756 --> 04:59.506
all we need to do is find the source.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.881
Chonies, you got any tech
that can shield us from the stink?

05:02.965 --> 05:06.340
Of course, Captain,
I think I have just the thing.

05:08.006 --> 05:10.965
[everyone gags, groans]

05:11.048 --> 05:13.090
This is your big idea?

05:13.173 --> 05:15.215
Chonies, you're fired!

05:16.090 --> 05:17.381
I did my best!

05:19.756 --> 05:20.756
Whew.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.423
Oh, snap! It's a quasar.

05:23.506 --> 05:24.590
I gotta get a pic!

05:24.673 --> 05:27.673
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen!

05:27.756 --> 05:29.965
And I've seen loads of things.

05:30.048 --> 05:32.381
Focus, Loaf. You can do this.

05:32.465 --> 05:33.631
Remember your training.

05:34.965 --> 05:36.590
Okay, Loaf, you sit here

05:36.673 --> 05:38.631
and press this button
to talk to the Pluto.

05:38.715 --> 05:40.506
Easiest job on the M-Bark.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.923
Unlike piloting a ship,

05:42.006 --> 05:43.840
where pressing even one wrong button

05:43.923 --> 05:46.590
can lead to everyone's fiery deaths!

05:46.673 --> 05:49.048
Also, you don't need a briefcase.

05:52.006 --> 05:54.465
Okay, these dogs are counting on you.

05:54.548 --> 05:56.465
If they find out
you aren't their Captain--

05:56.548 --> 05:58.048
-You're not the captain?
-What?

05:59.340 --> 06:02.090
No, no. I... I am. I am.

06:02.173 --> 06:04.715
[in a deep voice]
Uh... It's good to feel the space

06:04.798 --> 06:06.381
on my face again.

06:09.048 --> 06:12.006
Chonies... Any luck finding the... [gags]

06:12.090 --> 06:14.840
The gag? I mean, the source? [gags]

06:14.923 --> 06:18.673
The stench seems to be coming
from everywhere, Captain. Ugh.

06:18.756 --> 06:20.506
Let's stop for a breather, gang.

06:20.590 --> 06:24.298
Oh, I stopped breathing a long time ago.
[sharp exhale, sharp inhale]

06:25.131 --> 06:28.006
I feel like we're being watched. [gasps]

06:30.215 --> 06:32.298
[everyone wails]

06:32.381 --> 06:33.506
Whoa!

06:34.423 --> 06:36.090
[Nomi yells]

06:36.173 --> 06:38.840
[everyone yells]

06:43.715 --> 06:45.590
-[Chonies retches]
-[Ed retches]

06:47.590 --> 06:50.381
I think we may have found
the source of the smell.

06:56.381 --> 06:59.173
Whoa! Talking things!

07:00.465 --> 07:02.965
I thought you guys
were an eyebrow hair. [laughs]

07:03.590 --> 07:05.465
Finally, company!

07:06.548 --> 07:08.048
No offense, Stoneface Sam.

07:10.506 --> 07:12.715
All right, first ever two sided convo.

07:12.798 --> 07:15.840
Here we go. [clears throat, exhales]

07:15.923 --> 07:18.965
I'm fine, thanks. How are you?

07:19.048 --> 07:21.173
[everyone retches]

07:21.256 --> 07:22.756
[retches] Oh, we're good.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.548
You seem good! [laughs]

07:26.631 --> 07:30.256
I mean, I'm not sure what
that adorable little like [retch] is,

07:30.340 --> 07:32.298
that [retch], I don't know what that is,

07:32.381 --> 07:35.215
but... but... but I assume
it's something like wise and polite.

07:35.881 --> 07:38.715
Huh. I don't feel
like old pizza crust anymore.

07:38.798 --> 07:42.631
In fact, I feel great. It's the goo.

07:42.965 --> 07:45.131
This is gonna make me rich!

07:45.215 --> 07:47.215
Ed's Revitalizing Space Tonic:

07:47.298 --> 07:50.465
Feel like a 100 bucks for only 200 bucks!

07:50.548 --> 07:53.590
Anyway, I'm Captain Garbage of the Pluto.

07:53.673 --> 07:54.673
What's your name?

07:54.756 --> 07:56.506
Great question!

07:57.881 --> 07:58.923
[retches]

08:01.090 --> 08:02.215
What's my name?

08:02.840 --> 08:06.173
You're gooey, so... [gags] ...Gooey?

08:06.381 --> 08:08.298
[gasps] It's perfect.

08:09.298 --> 08:11.423
My name is Gooey! [laughs]

08:11.506 --> 08:13.506
It's Gooey! [laughs]

08:13.590 --> 08:16.506
Gooey! Gooey! Gooey! Gooey!

08:16.590 --> 08:18.881
I love it. Oh, what's my name? Gooey!

08:18.965 --> 08:20.298
Oh, okay, table for two, please.

08:20.381 --> 08:23.465
-Are all of your missions this bizarre?
-Name is Gooey. [laughs] Gooey!

08:23.548 --> 08:24.548
It varies.

08:29.340 --> 08:33.048
And we are now entering
a galaxy called-- [screams]

08:35.256 --> 08:36.298
The Creamy Way.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.131
All I see is dark.

08:38.215 --> 08:40.048
Yeah, me too.

08:40.131 --> 08:42.506
Oh, this tour blows.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.798
-Are we sure this guy is the Captain?
-[laughs nervously]

08:46.048 --> 08:48.465
[computer] Automatic flight mode disabled.

08:49.048 --> 08:52.798
-[everyone screams]
-He's really not the Captain!

08:52.881 --> 08:55.131
So what brings you cuties here?

08:55.215 --> 08:58.298
Well Gooey, we are on a mission
to find a new... [gags]

09:00.173 --> 09:03.215
Home for all
of Earth's wonderful creatures,

09:03.298 --> 09:06.340
including but not limited to
ourselves and humans.

09:06.715 --> 09:08.173
Humans, huh?

09:08.256 --> 09:10.256
No idea what they are,
but they sound terrific.

09:10.340 --> 09:12.131
You think they'd want to live here
with me?

09:12.215 --> 09:14.965
Well, the thing is... [gags]

09:15.048 --> 09:17.506
Humans kind of have an anti-stink.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.340
-...tion! Stinction!
They are anti-extinction.

09:20.423 --> 09:23.340
Our planet's dying
and we need somewhere to live pronto.

09:23.423 --> 09:24.590
Oh, no!

09:24.673 --> 09:28.215
But we're not sure this planet
is right for them, so... [gags]

09:28.298 --> 09:30.090
[exclaims] Okay, bye!

09:30.840 --> 09:31.840
No, wait!

09:33.631 --> 09:34.923
Ugh, sorry, it's just...

09:35.006 --> 09:37.881
Um, You don't know how incredible
this planet is yet.

09:37.965 --> 09:40.048
I know it inside and out. Literally!

09:40.131 --> 09:42.131
It's basically my shell.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.048
Why don't I give my new buddies a tour?

09:44.131 --> 09:45.590
Oh... [gags]

09:45.673 --> 09:47.423
...you really don't have to.

09:47.506 --> 09:49.840
I know, but I... I want to, okay?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.381
Plus, I'm... I'm very... [sigh]

09:51.465 --> 09:53.965
...what's the word for when you wish
the planet you're living on is haunted

09:54.048 --> 09:55.798
so that you can make friends with ghosts?

09:55.881 --> 09:56.923
Loneliness.

09:57.006 --> 09:58.048
No, not that.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.840
The... The one where you spend
six hours shouting into a cave

10:00.923 --> 10:02.215
'cause an echo is the closest thing

10:02.298 --> 10:04.256
you're ever going to get
to a conversation.

10:04.340 --> 10:05.756
Loneliness.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.840
No. It's more like when you're all alone
and it makes you feel sad.

10:10.048 --> 10:11.590
Loneliness, trust me.

10:11.673 --> 10:14.923
Oh, wait, I remember, alone-liness.

10:16.798 --> 10:18.965
There's Fruittastic Forest,

10:19.048 --> 10:22.381
the perfect place to unwind
after a long day of relaxing.

10:22.465 --> 10:24.215
[gags] Or a long day of gagging.

10:24.298 --> 10:26.715
And there's Crystal Clear Cove,

10:26.798 --> 10:30.006
the perfect place to relax
after a long day of unwinding.

10:30.090 --> 10:33.131
-[everyone gags]
-[gagging] It's really beautiful.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.798
And you'll have it all to yourselves,

10:34.881 --> 10:37.631
except for me of course,
because I'm stuck here forever... [laughs]

10:37.715 --> 10:39.590
...no matter how much I dream of leaving.

10:40.798 --> 10:42.090
So when do you want to move in?

10:44.048 --> 10:45.590
[Stella gags]

10:45.673 --> 10:47.923
Look, Gooey, your planet... [gags]

10:48.006 --> 10:49.798
...seems almost perfect but--

10:49.881 --> 10:51.173
It smells terrible!

10:51.256 --> 10:53.840
This odor will haunt me
for the rest of my life.

10:53.923 --> 10:55.965
It's like if a rotten fish
crawled out of a decaying turtle,

10:56.048 --> 10:58.590
jumped into a store
and was sprayed by one thousand skunks!

10:58.673 --> 11:00.840
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

11:00.923 --> 11:02.756
[vomits]

11:02.840 --> 11:03.840
Wow.

11:03.923 --> 11:06.298
-[everyone screams]
-[Oliver] Whoa!

11:09.173 --> 11:11.173
[everyone grunts, screams]

11:11.673 --> 11:13.465
[Loaf grunts]

11:15.048 --> 11:16.548
-[pants]
-Whoa! [grunts]

11:16.631 --> 11:17.798
[Bucky] Hey, Captain!

11:17.881 --> 11:19.881
My seat belt's stuck!

11:19.965 --> 11:22.048
He's not the Captain, bruh!

11:22.131 --> 11:23.173
I'm not the Captain!

11:23.256 --> 11:25.673
[gasps] Fake Captain, behind you!

11:26.548 --> 11:28.256
[screams]

11:29.048 --> 11:31.006
Well, I hadn't even noticed the smell.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.715
Gosh, where is it coming from?

11:32.798 --> 11:33.923
You have any ideas?

11:34.006 --> 11:36.298
I don't see
a garbage can around or anything.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.256
Wait, is it me?

11:39.340 --> 11:40.798
[everyone gags, groans]

11:40.881 --> 11:43.923
It is! Oh, I feel terrible!

11:44.006 --> 11:48.381
-I am so, so sorry!
-[everyone gags, groans]

11:48.465 --> 11:51.465
Yeah, no, we get it.
Just please stop apologizing.

11:52.131 --> 11:55.131
We'll keep exploring the universe.
We love it! That's what we do!

11:55.631 --> 11:58.340
But what if you don't find
a new planet in time?

11:58.423 --> 12:02.256
Ugh! If I could leave
and let you guys stay, I definitely would.

12:02.340 --> 12:05.506
I would love to explore the great unknown.

12:05.590 --> 12:09.090
-[everyone gags, groans]
-Well, what if we gave you our ship?

12:09.173 --> 12:11.715
The Pluto could be your new shell,
then you could leave.

12:11.798 --> 12:14.423
[gasps] Deal!

12:15.965 --> 12:18.756
No, Garbage. This is Gooey's home.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.756
[gags, coughs]
You're right. It is his home

12:21.840 --> 12:24.090
and he can offer it to us if he wants.

12:24.173 --> 12:26.215
Doesn't mean we should take it.

12:26.298 --> 12:28.131
Who are we to stop the slug
from doing what he wants to do?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.090
How would you like it
if someone kicked you out of your home?

12:30.173 --> 12:31.673
-It's a win, win, win--
-That's not the point.

12:31.756 --> 12:33.423
Okay team, uh, dog huddle?

12:33.506 --> 12:36.215
It pains me to say it, but...

12:36.298 --> 12:38.340
[inhales] Garbage is right.

12:38.423 --> 12:41.465
Oh, yeah! All right! Uh-huh!

12:41.548 --> 12:43.340
Oh, yeah! Take that! [sings] All right!

12:43.423 --> 12:45.006
Gooey offered to leave, that means--

12:45.090 --> 12:46.756
-Saving humans...
-[Captain Garbage vocalizes]

12:46.840 --> 12:48.923
-...who also have no issues...
-[Captain Garbage] Oh, yeah!

12:49.006 --> 12:51.256
...kicking innocent beings
out of their natural habitats.

12:51.340 --> 12:53.423
Maybe he wants to see the galaxy,

12:53.506 --> 12:56.048
charter the unknown,
make friends across the universe.

12:56.131 --> 12:58.215
That's better
than being stuck here, right?

12:58.298 --> 13:01.048
Hmm. Yeah, it does sound better.

13:01.131 --> 13:04.465
So many of the planets we visited
could be suitable for Gooey.

13:04.548 --> 13:06.965
-It's what I really want.
-[everyone shouts, gags]

13:07.048 --> 13:08.965
I want to explore!

13:10.340 --> 13:11.756
Sorry to eavesdrop... [chuckles]

13:11.840 --> 13:13.340
...you're standing on my ear.

13:14.465 --> 13:15.465
[Ed gags]

13:16.548 --> 13:17.673
This is impossible.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.923
Gooey is literally
the size of this planet.

13:22.923 --> 13:25.048
Wait, do you need me to be smaller?

13:25.131 --> 13:26.506
Check this out.

13:26.590 --> 13:29.715
[straining]

13:33.590 --> 13:35.548
[continues straining]

13:41.298 --> 13:42.881
Ta-da!

13:45.881 --> 13:46.881
[Nomi grunts]

13:49.506 --> 13:50.506
[grunts]

13:53.465 --> 13:56.673
Uh, team, I'm leaving with Gooey.

13:56.756 --> 13:58.756
[gasps] What? Nomi, you can't!

13:58.840 --> 14:02.381
We found a planet, Captain,
our mission's over.

14:02.465 --> 14:03.631
It's like you said,

14:03.715 --> 14:07.298
"Exploring the galaxy
is better than being stuck in one place."

14:07.381 --> 14:09.423
Even if you're stuck here with us?

14:09.506 --> 14:12.006
Well, I don't want to be stuck anywhere.

14:12.090 --> 14:14.006
But... but what about the smell?

14:14.090 --> 14:16.590
I'm... [gags]
...getting used to it. [gags]

14:16.673 --> 14:18.256
But we don't want you to leave.

14:18.756 --> 14:20.923
I'll come back. I love you guys.

14:21.506 --> 14:23.673
I'm just not ready to settle down yet.

14:24.465 --> 14:25.465
I'm sorry.

14:32.506 --> 14:33.506
As your Captain,

14:33.590 --> 14:35.840
I command you to come back and visit us,

14:35.923 --> 14:37.840
and as your friend... [grunts]

14:41.798 --> 14:43.798
Be safe out there, you little rascal.

14:43.881 --> 14:45.340
Never! [laughs]

14:45.423 --> 14:47.340
Mm! Hey, if you run into an alien

14:47.423 --> 14:49.381
that looks like a fedora
with an elephant trunk,

14:49.465 --> 14:52.590
don't tell her where I'm at.
I owe her a lot of money.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.465
Living life for yourself,

14:55.548 --> 14:57.465
-attagirl.
-[both gasp]

14:58.590 --> 14:59.923
One last order:

15:00.006 --> 15:01.256
message Loaf on the Pluto,

15:01.340 --> 15:02.715
tell him to let the Council know

15:02.798 --> 15:04.340
we found our home.

15:04.423 --> 15:05.631
Aye, aye, Captain.

15:18.756 --> 15:21.798
[clears throat] "Friends, we did it.

15:21.881 --> 15:24.548
We triumphed where all others failed.

15:24.631 --> 15:27.465
We stood on our own two hind legs

15:27.548 --> 15:29.465
-and rose to the occasion...
-Hey!

15:29.548 --> 15:32.340
-What is happening?
-...heroically saving Earth!

15:32.423 --> 15:35.340
We spat in the face of danger!

15:35.423 --> 15:38.840
-We put on--"
-Uh, yeah and danger is about to spit back

15:38.923 --> 15:40.090
right in our faces!

15:40.590 --> 15:42.173
Captain, the planet is dying!

15:42.840 --> 15:44.631
We... Say what?

15:45.340 --> 15:46.340
[shouts]

15:48.048 --> 15:50.756
-This is Stella, do you read?
-Chonies to Nomi, come in!

15:56.090 --> 15:58.048
The planet is shriveling up! [gasps]

15:58.131 --> 16:00.715
Gooey's moisture
must have been keeping it alive.

16:02.131 --> 16:04.506
Hey! You better pay me back for that.

16:08.381 --> 16:09.381
[grunts]

16:09.465 --> 16:12.423
-[clamoring]
-[Stella] Don't make me punch you! Sit!

16:12.506 --> 16:13.923
Ugh. Fine.

16:17.506 --> 16:18.506
[button beeps]

16:23.756 --> 16:26.423
Well, I know which button
activates the wipers.

16:27.506 --> 16:29.006
That's a start, right?

16:31.548 --> 16:33.798
Hey, is that a wishing star?

16:33.881 --> 16:35.590
No, that's not a wishing star.

16:35.673 --> 16:37.340
That's an emergency Pluto flare.

16:38.256 --> 16:40.381
[gasps] That's an emergency Pluto flare,

16:40.465 --> 16:41.715
they must be in danger!

16:43.881 --> 16:45.756
Well, Gigi, your wish just came true,

16:45.840 --> 16:47.631
your real Captain has arrived.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.173
It's me.

16:49.256 --> 16:50.673
TOUR GUIDE

16:54.798 --> 16:57.590
Well, I guess spending my final moments
with you weirdos

16:57.673 --> 16:59.006
beats dying alone.

16:59.090 --> 17:02.131
I'm just glad that Nomi got out of here
before it was too late.

17:06.381 --> 17:08.381
[dramatic music playing]

17:14.340 --> 17:16.131
-[record scratches, music stops]
-Ew! Chonies,

17:16.215 --> 17:18.256
your paw is so clammy!

17:18.340 --> 17:21.673
No offense, but that's not the last thing
I want to feel before I die.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.965
That's an M-Bark pod! We're saved!

17:32.715 --> 17:33.798
[grunts]

17:33.881 --> 17:34.965
[Stella] Loaf?

17:35.590 --> 17:37.798
Huh. Would never have called that.

17:43.173 --> 17:44.798
Hey, it's Loaf.
I'm not at my station right now

17:44.881 --> 17:47.548
because I try to maintain
a work-life balance. Beep!

17:47.631 --> 17:51.006
Loaf, we found a planet!
The mission is accomplished!

17:51.090 --> 17:52.423
Sending coordinates now.

17:54.215 --> 17:55.298
Goodbye, old friend.

17:56.756 --> 17:58.840
Okay, new friend. Let's go!

17:58.923 --> 18:00.590
I love having a friend.

18:00.673 --> 18:02.215
Do you think you'll miss your friends?

18:02.298 --> 18:04.381
I know I will. They're awesome.

18:04.465 --> 18:07.298
Eh, I've only known them for 14 dog years.

18:07.381 --> 18:09.173
That's only most of my life.
[laughs nervously]

18:12.340 --> 18:15.756
-Gooey, do you think I'm making a mistake?
-Yep.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.798
I mean... [scoffs] ...I don't know.

18:17.881 --> 18:21.131
I want to explore space,
but mainly to make new friends

18:21.215 --> 18:22.715
like the ones you have.

18:22.798 --> 18:24.715
Wow. Questions are hard.

18:25.298 --> 18:29.090
But when humans come, they'll make me live
in a stuffy house with stuffy rules

18:29.173 --> 18:31.673
and every day
will be stuffy, stuffy, stuffy!

18:31.756 --> 18:33.006
I can't go back to that.

18:33.506 --> 18:35.465
Hey, I haven't known you for long,

18:35.548 --> 18:37.673
but I don't think
anyone could hold you back

18:37.756 --> 18:39.090
from living your own life.

18:40.298 --> 18:43.548
You know, for someone
who's only ever spoken to echoes,

18:43.631 --> 18:45.298
you're very intuitive.

18:45.381 --> 18:47.090
[chuckles] Let's go back.

18:56.215 --> 19:00.840
My friends! No! [cries]

19:03.923 --> 19:05.340
[Captain Garbage] Hey, Nomi! On your left.

19:05.423 --> 19:06.423
[gasps]

19:08.256 --> 19:09.715
-Yes!
-Woo-hoo!

19:09.798 --> 19:12.048
Yay! My new friends didn't die!

19:12.881 --> 19:15.798
Well, I guess this is goodbye, Gooey.

19:15.881 --> 19:19.756
Well, it was nice adventuring with you
for a half an hour or so... [chuckles]

19:19.840 --> 19:21.631
But like the old saying goes,

19:21.715 --> 19:24.798
there's no place like being trapped
in my planet alone forever.

19:25.673 --> 19:26.923
[sighs]

19:27.006 --> 19:29.590
Mind if I just gaze out
at the Galaxy one last time

19:29.673 --> 19:30.965
before you put me back?

19:32.048 --> 19:34.548
Hmm. I know, I'm sorry, Gooey.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.965
I wish we had a different...

19:36.048 --> 19:38.381
[gasps] ...ship to give you!

19:38.465 --> 19:39.506
That's it!

19:41.506 --> 19:42.715
I love you guys!

19:42.798 --> 19:45.465
I have no idea where I'm going!

19:50.048 --> 19:51.506
Worst tour ever.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.923
[outro theme music playing]
