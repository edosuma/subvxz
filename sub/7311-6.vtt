00:20.410 --> 00:22.080
Hello?

00:27.910 --> 00:29.710
Hello.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.806
Oh, Alice, it's just me.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.786
That's the third time you've
done that to me this year.

00:40.810 --> 00:42.486
You know I don't like surprises.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.120
Yeah, well... Surprise.

00:45.560 --> 00:48.120
It's our one-month anniversary.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.750
I knew there was a reason I married you.

00:57.990 --> 01:00.060
- I'll be right back.
- Be right here.

01:00.900 --> 01:04.680
Okay. All right. Little Barry.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.040
Alice?

01:24.540 --> 01:26.470
Alice, what's wrong?

02:04.310 --> 02:05.436
Run for your life, probie, run.

02:05.460 --> 02:06.046
What are you doing?

02:06.070 --> 02:07.716
Just trying to save your life.

02:07.740 --> 02:08.545
What did you do?

02:08.570 --> 02:10.186
Why do you assume it's
me? That's a good point,

02:10.210 --> 02:11.876
- but in this case, actually...
- McGee!

02:11.900 --> 02:13.186
Too late.

02:13.210 --> 02:14.366
Why is she sitting at my...

02:14.390 --> 02:15.406
You're on your own, probie.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.806
McGee, get in here!

02:16.830 --> 02:19.106
Plead temporary insanity.
It's your best bet.

02:19.130 --> 02:20.716
What did I tell you, McGee?

02:20.740 --> 02:23.000
About what?

02:31.390 --> 02:33.766
I told you to destroy those... twice.

02:33.790 --> 02:37.486
I did. I did. No.
I... I-I didn't, um...

02:37.510 --> 02:39.126
Tony. Tony. Tony must have...

02:39.150 --> 02:40.766
What, when you went to get coffee?

02:40.790 --> 02:43.560
You did not erase those photos, did you?

02:43.970 --> 02:48.466
Admit it, and I will
spare you one of your eyes.

02:48.490 --> 02:50.986
I did not erase those photos.

02:51.010 --> 02:53.216
I think I know what
happened. Um, I-I-I-I...

02:53.240 --> 02:56.896
I just deleted my old
screensaver, and theoretically,

02:56.920 --> 02:59.626
the operating system could have
defaulted to the photo directory,

02:59.650 --> 03:00.820
but, you know, the odds...

03:00.850 --> 03:02.626
Today's not your lucky day.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.266
It is Halloween later this week.

03:04.290 --> 03:07.166
And I did see a black cat this morning.

03:07.190 --> 03:08.896
Well, it was... it was dark brown.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.746
Give me your hand.

03:10.770 --> 03:13.056
Better than losing an eye, McGee.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.456
Let's go.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.166
- What do we got, boss?
- What do we got?

03:16.190 --> 03:18.236
We got a...

03:18.260 --> 03:20.730
It's a good question, DiNozzo.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.396
My-My mother isn't quite herself today.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.536
Psycho.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.416
You certainly have your moments.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.036
The movie, Ziva.

03:35.060 --> 03:37.280
Norman Bates. Shower scene.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.486
Looks like their night was ruined.

03:40.510 --> 03:42.446
I am going to ruin McGee's whole year.

03:42.470 --> 03:45.666
Don't you think you're being a
little uptight about this photo thing?

03:45.690 --> 03:47.716
No, really. What do you
think he's doing with it?

03:47.740 --> 03:51.830
I would rather shave my
eyeballs than contemplate that.

03:53.270 --> 03:57.476
Blood is human, boss. Not pure, but,
uh, enough to make Janet Leigh scream.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.566
We thought it prudent to
notify Ducky, given the amount.

04:00.590 --> 04:01.356
Source?

04:01.380 --> 04:03.626
McGee's still looking for it.

04:03.650 --> 04:07.970
Mother! Blood! Blood!

04:09.310 --> 04:10.256
Psycho.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.400
He has his moments.

04:13.710 --> 04:16.346
I spoke to the colonel in
charge of base operations.

04:16.370 --> 04:20.036
These outlying homes receive
their water from local aquifers.

04:20.060 --> 04:23.476
Water's drawn into holding tanks and
distributed to these smaller nodes.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.156
Pumped to the houses as needed.

04:25.180 --> 04:27.496
It's a technology as old as the hills.

04:27.520 --> 04:33.056
At Skara Brae in Scotland, as I recall,
a Neolithic stone village was uncovered,

04:33.080 --> 04:35.790
complete with plumbing.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.300
Dr. Mallard?

04:45.380 --> 04:48.256
Sorry. I'll go get the wrap.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.450
- You can drain it.
- Yes, sir.

04:57.090 --> 05:00.426
Some bloating, to be
expected with the submersion.

05:00.450 --> 05:05.256
However, that man has not been
in that tank more than 24 hours.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.346
That your time of death?

05:06.370 --> 05:07.226
Perhaps.

05:07.250 --> 05:11.310
As to the cause, these
lacerations were made postmortem.

05:11.340 --> 05:15.116
Note the styrofoam-ish
aspect to the wounds.

05:15.140 --> 05:19.746
Oh, blunt-force trauma to the head,
but I doubt that's a fatal blow.

05:19.770 --> 05:22.046
I can also rule out drowning.

05:22.070 --> 05:25.710
Yes, were that the case,
even with the immersion,

05:25.750 --> 05:31.830
there would be conspicuous amounts
of froth on his nose and mouth.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.700
Hello, hello, hello. What have we here?

05:37.380 --> 05:40.506
Mr. Palmer, get his chin.

05:40.530 --> 05:43.190
Open wide.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.856
Ah, the plot thickens.

05:53.880 --> 05:57.830
What does that say? A Web site?

06:07.340 --> 06:09.696
Primitus-victor. Com
is just a placeholder.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.446
The link redirects to a CyberVid video.

06:12.470 --> 06:13.756
Cyber... vid?

06:13.780 --> 06:17.606
Anyone can upload anything,
and anyone can watch it.

06:17.630 --> 06:19.836
You know, boss, like, uh, LonelyGirl15?

06:19.860 --> 06:22.790
- Evolution of Dance?
- Numa Numa Guy.

06:24.630 --> 06:26.560
- Yeah.
- How cute.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.810
You got to see this. There he goes.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.960
I love this guy.

06:38.740 --> 06:42.100
Sorry. Back to... Back to our video.

06:42.420 --> 06:45.000
We're the first viewers.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.820
What is this?

06:51.170 --> 06:53.466
That's our dead guy.

06:53.490 --> 06:56.960
Oh, don't get in the van, man.

06:58.580 --> 07:01.030
What was that?

07:25.070 --> 07:25.856
ID?

07:25.880 --> 07:27.586
No hits on the victim's prints yet.

07:27.610 --> 07:28.726
I'm still running the DNA.

07:28.750 --> 07:31.256
The CyberVid account and
redirect links were opened

07:31.280 --> 07:34.160
at an Internet cafe in Richmond
anonymously a month ago.

07:34.190 --> 07:36.086
- Someone might remember something.
- Go.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.136
David, DiNozzo.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.436
Talk to security at Quantico.

07:38.460 --> 07:40.036
See who didn't show up for work.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.776
Um, Gibbs?

07:41.800 --> 07:46.046
Primitus victor... it's
Latin. It means first victim.

07:46.070 --> 07:48.720
Yeah. I know, Abs.

07:53.020 --> 07:55.340
This never gets old.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.906
Ah, nice timing, Jethro.

08:04.930 --> 08:08.166
I thought you'd like to see
what we've found in our scans.

08:08.190 --> 08:10.716
Or rather, what we didn't find.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.166
His brain... is missing!

08:13.190 --> 08:16.966
There's no need to get
so excited, Mr. Palmer.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.096
Where did it go?

08:18.120 --> 08:22.716
Well, it appears to have been removed
trans-nasally in a manner similar to that used

08:22.740 --> 08:26.076
by the ancient Egyptians
prior to mummification,

08:26.100 --> 08:30.130
most likely using a
tool similar to this.

08:30.170 --> 08:33.405
A missing brain, and
so close to Halloween.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.336
That's enough to make you want to...

08:36.360 --> 08:39.110
go clean some pipettes.

08:39.929 --> 08:41.226
Postmortem?

08:41.250 --> 08:44.006
Well, judging by the
intracranial hemorrhaging,

08:44.030 --> 08:48.766
I believe the entire cerebrum was
removed when he was still alive.

08:48.790 --> 08:54.210
Unconscious, of course, but
alive, until of course, he wasn't.

08:54.620 --> 08:55.576
Thanks, Duck.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.730
At which point, he was frozen.

08:59.890 --> 09:00.716
Frozen?

09:00.740 --> 09:06.626
Abby's tissue analysis shows massive cellular
ruptures that indicate the body was frozen.

09:06.650 --> 09:07.806
So, time of death?

09:07.830 --> 09:11.336
Oh, not something that I can
determine with any degree of accuracy.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.446
Perhaps that was the intent.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.500
Perhaps not.

09:15.540 --> 09:18.026
There are many parts
to this puzzle, Jethro.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.956
It's not a puzzle, Duck.

09:19.980 --> 09:22.156
A game?

09:22.180 --> 09:25.006
Oh, it's one that this poor fellow lost.

09:25.030 --> 09:27.056
Victim's name is Billy Cole.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.376
26, native of Virginia.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.676
- Civilian?
- Yeah. Cole worked at a local car wash.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.266
Abby got a hit off his DNA.

09:33.290 --> 09:35.336
Two years ago, he donated his sperm.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.996
Ah, the things people will do for money.

09:38.020 --> 09:39.236
You donated your sperm.

09:39.260 --> 09:41.426
Didn't do that for the money.
Just to enrich the world.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.126
So, boss, I spoke to
security at Quantico.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.180
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I interrupt?

09:46.480 --> 09:49.450
Let's see who the boss likes better.

09:51.110 --> 09:53.340
Ziva?

09:54.530 --> 09:58.556
Security at Quantico insists no one could have
gotten past their checkpoints with a body.

09:58.580 --> 10:03.706
Might have used one of the rivers, but how do you
drag a dead guy two miles through the water unless...

10:03.730 --> 10:04.600
It was frozen.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.306
No. I was gonna say, unless you had one of those
James Bond submersible sleds from Thunderball,

10:08.330 --> 10:10.546
but frozen's good. Float him right in.

10:10.570 --> 10:11.646
What else you got?

10:11.670 --> 10:13.600
Actually...

10:15.940 --> 10:18.746
You know, actually, I
don't have anything else.

10:18.770 --> 10:22.556
Cole had no criminal record, and,
uh, no one reported him missing.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.346
Any connection to the couple on base?

10:24.370 --> 10:26.576
As far as I can tell, they were the
first ones to turn on their water.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.376
Well, the killer did leave a
message for whoever found the body.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.480
Click the click.

10:32.050 --> 10:34.766
A cryptic message.

10:34.790 --> 10:37.046
Could be anything.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.950
But we'll figure it
out. We can do better.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.330
McGee, Billy Cole's address.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.016
- DiNozzo.
- On your six, Boss.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.176
Hey, you haven't forgot about
that screensaver, have you, Ziva?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.486
Actually, I had.

10:52.510 --> 10:53.726
Thanks for reminding me.

10:53.750 --> 10:56.000
What are friends for?

10:57.290 --> 11:00.050
Nice place. Glad I'm
up on my tetanus shots.

11:01.060 --> 11:05.026
Everything okay, boss? You seem
kind of quiet... er than usual.

11:05.050 --> 11:07.146
You're worried this is just the first?

11:07.170 --> 11:10.040
Eh, worried it's not.

11:14.050 --> 11:16.290
Federal agents!

11:26.500 --> 11:29.280
We closed the garage door!

11:32.260 --> 11:35.286
Billy disappeared, I don't
know, about a week ago.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.476
Owed me a couple months' rent.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.466
Figured he was just skipping out on us.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.406
I can't believe he's dead.

11:40.430 --> 11:42.646
Were you and he...

11:42.670 --> 11:44.826
No. My God, never.

11:44.850 --> 11:47.660
No, just every other
guy in the zip code.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.046
We were just roommates.

11:51.070 --> 11:53.896
That's actually the name
of our band, Just Roommates.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.026
Billy was our lead guitarist
until I found a new one.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.530
- The guy just didn't get it.
- It?

12:01.530 --> 12:04.386
If you have to ask, you
obviously don't get it, either.

12:04.410 --> 12:05.916
Need to see his room.

12:05.940 --> 12:08.876
This is his room, Agent...

12:08.900 --> 12:11.606
- Gibbs.
- Gibbs.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.800
That's an interesting name.

12:21.390 --> 12:26.496
So now that he's dead, Agent Interesting
Name, if he has any money anywhere,

12:26.520 --> 12:29.716
you know with the rent he owes
us, that would be really...

12:29.740 --> 12:31.710
okay.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.646
What happened? Was it a robbery?

12:34.670 --> 12:37.980
Well, that's what we're...
trying to figure, ma'am.

12:38.640 --> 12:42.456
Should we make you a list? You know,
people he knew, phone numbers and stuff?

12:42.480 --> 12:44.126
I watch a lot of TV.

12:44.150 --> 12:46.226
Whatever you got.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.356
Who was the last one to see him?

12:48.380 --> 12:52.746
I did. He said he was going
out for a beer. Never came back.

12:52.770 --> 12:54.286
He does that sometimes.

12:54.310 --> 12:58.556
The guy's got no focus, and I told him when I let him
in the band I needed a lead that I could count on.

12:58.580 --> 13:00.866
You know, "no amateurs need apply."

13:00.890 --> 13:04.130
Boss. Check this out.

13:06.230 --> 13:08.006
You know where this was taken?

13:08.030 --> 13:11.310
Yeah. Why?

13:13.950 --> 13:16.326
I hate serial killers.

13:16.350 --> 13:21.030
Though, at least this one was kind enough
to give us the location of the murder.

13:22.310 --> 13:24.686
And the murder weapon.

13:24.710 --> 13:27.300
You know, these things
always come in threes, boss.

13:27.330 --> 13:33.550
He gave us the location, the murder
weapon, and the time of death.

13:35.210 --> 13:37.406
He's daring us to find him.

13:37.430 --> 13:40.510
Someone wasn't hugged enough as a child.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.140
I guess Latin for "second victim."

14:01.230 --> 14:03.190
What's that?

14:05.100 --> 14:07.640
Hello, Agent Gibbs...

14:31.660 --> 14:35.850
Anything, anything you want whatever
you want. Please, let me go. Please.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.700
Please let me go... Where are you?

14:41.370 --> 14:45.670
No, no-no, no, no, no... No, please...

15:05.020 --> 15:08.630
Between Mother Theresa and
Hitler, I guess there's all kinds.

15:10.220 --> 15:13.416
How does he know who
was assigned to the case?

15:13.440 --> 15:15.246
- Working on it.
- Director?

15:15.270 --> 15:16.936
Well, we should've seen that coming.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.386
Another murder has been
posted on the popular...

15:19.410 --> 15:21.776
Do I need to tell you Secnav is
already breathing down my neck?

15:21.800 --> 15:23.446
If it'll make you feel better.

15:23.470 --> 15:27.080
Secnav is already breathing
down my neck. Now you know.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.856
I'll handle him, you handle this.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.170
Park in rural Virginia.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.940
Just watch your back, Gibbs.

15:33.390 --> 15:37.006
If the killer's following the same pattern,
then each of these clues refers to the time,

15:37.030 --> 15:39.876
location and cause of
death of the next victim.

15:39.900 --> 15:42.236
Wes Craven he's not.

15:42.260 --> 15:45.806
Nightmare on Elm Street.
Scream. Swamp Thing.

15:45.830 --> 15:48.076
Plenty scary to me. I
had nightmares all night.

15:48.100 --> 15:51.616
That's 'cause you're a lily-livered, little
chicken pants who sleeps on plastic sheets.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.476
If you are done, I suggest
we start with cause of death.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.980
Radiation poisoning.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.276
Drowning.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.570
Killer nun.

16:04.450 --> 16:06.456
Maybe we should try location.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.656
Uh, some kind of, uh, bombing range?

16:08.680 --> 16:11.720
Anchor... age, Alaska?

16:12.270 --> 16:14.486
Convent.

16:14.510 --> 16:17.026
Is that where they keep the killer nuns?

16:17.050 --> 16:20.166
Look, all I'm saying is some of the
nuns I knew could get extremely agitated.

16:20.190 --> 16:23.086
Tell me you got something
better than agitated nuns.

16:23.110 --> 16:26.296
Well, we got an ID off dead
guy number two's prints, boss.

16:26.320 --> 16:30.446
Bob Simms. 51, former Navy chief.

16:30.470 --> 16:32.886
Current address is Central
Union Shelter in DC.

16:32.910 --> 16:33.696
He was homeless.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.070
Connection to the first victim?

16:35.110 --> 16:38.856
None we could find, unless you count
yanking his brain out through his nostrils.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.396
Video was uploaded to another
anonymous CyberVid account.

16:41.420 --> 16:44.670
That's McGee-speak for "we weren't
able to trace that one, either."

16:44.700 --> 16:47.436
I might be able to help with that.

16:47.460 --> 16:49.336
Those videos are all over the news.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.656
As soon as I saw them,
I knew I had to come in.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.330
I think I know who made them.

16:57.090 --> 17:00.516
It's Tommy's band, but Billy was
really the one that made things happen.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.796
I can't believe he's dead.

17:02.820 --> 17:04.496
Were you and he, um...

17:04.520 --> 17:05.925
Just friends.

17:05.950 --> 17:09.236
I usually like guys that
are a little more mature.

17:09.260 --> 17:11.460
Older.

17:12.710 --> 17:13.396
The video?

17:13.420 --> 17:18.816
Right, um, a while ago, Billy decided we
should start promoting ourselves a little more.

17:18.839 --> 17:21.496
Answered an ad for this
guy who makes music videos.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.880
This is ours.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.770
I'm not really a professional singer.

17:35.120 --> 17:39.876
Well, you have a very, um, interesting
way of holding the microphone.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.236
Ziva.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.360
No, it's okay.

17:43.390 --> 17:46.490
Haven't really figured
out what I am yet.

17:49.570 --> 17:52.350
Wait, this is it.

17:56.190 --> 17:56.976
Name?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.570
Director's info's on the disc.

18:02.340 --> 18:06.346
Sam Loomis, Loominosity Pictures.

18:06.370 --> 18:08.066
It's in Arlington.

18:08.090 --> 18:10.490
Take DiNozzo.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.706
- She's pretty.
- She's a good agent.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.326
You guys hiring?

18:20.350 --> 18:23.086
I wouldn't mind hanging out.

18:23.110 --> 18:26.000
I feel safe here.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.536
I can assign an agent to you.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.850
- You?
- No.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.640
I'll be okay, I guess.

18:36.330 --> 18:39.080
You got a problem, give me a call.

18:39.110 --> 18:42.136
Only if you have a problem.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.836
That obvious?

18:43.860 --> 18:45.266
And I was trying to hide it.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.050
Another thing I'm not good at.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.610
Take care you of yourself, Rose.

18:52.750 --> 18:55.270
I'm working on it.

19:00.060 --> 19:02.076
Nice girl.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.516
Wasn't my type, though.

19:03.540 --> 19:04.616
Really?

19:04.640 --> 19:06.036
She was breathing.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.416
Well, I have standards, Ziva.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.090
Otherwise, I'd be dating you.

19:11.060 --> 19:13.640
Hello?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.126
What do you want?

19:16.150 --> 19:17.756
NCIS.

19:17.780 --> 19:20.600
Like to ask you a few questions.

19:23.730 --> 19:27.180
Sorry. Been robbed
once already this month.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.556
We're looking for Sam Loomis.

19:32.580 --> 19:33.706
You're looking at him.

19:33.730 --> 19:35.386
The music video director?

19:35.410 --> 19:40.370
Yeah, and, uh... weddings
and I did one bris.

19:41.210 --> 19:43.466
Come on in.

19:43.490 --> 19:45.866
Well, it's like you died
and went to probie heaven.

19:45.890 --> 19:47.716
Sorry this place is such a mess.

19:47.740 --> 19:50.046
Used to be a lot neater.
I was an accountant.

19:50.070 --> 19:53.736
Didn't even have e-mail when
I retired, and now look at me.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.786
What can I do for you?

19:55.810 --> 19:57.376
Do you know...

19:57.400 --> 19:59.386
Hang on a sec. I, uh...

19:59.410 --> 20:02.590
I hit some tail at the assisted
living center across the street,

20:02.620 --> 20:05.946
and, uh, now she won't leave me alone.

20:05.970 --> 20:10.496
Sorry, uh... yes. I know
him. He was my first.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.186
- First?
- Music video.

20:12.210 --> 20:16.526
I went down to the Apple Store to get an iPod
for my grandson, and stayed for the free classes.

20:16.550 --> 20:22.030
And now I pull in five C-notes
a month shooting freelance video.

20:28.350 --> 20:29.586
Billy Cole is dead.

20:29.610 --> 20:32.606
Yeah, I know. I saw it on the net.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.170
What does it have to do with me?

20:34.200 --> 20:37.436
Your video is very similar to
the one the killer left behind.

20:37.460 --> 20:38.846
So that makes me a suspect?

20:38.870 --> 20:41.246
It makes a coincidence and
I'm not a big fan of them.

20:41.270 --> 20:46.146
Well, actually, it makes
about 300,000 coincidences.

20:46.170 --> 20:48.836
That first video, I didn't
have a clue what I was doing.

20:48.860 --> 20:51.900
Luckily, I had some help.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.396
Been working or surfing the Internet?

20:55.420 --> 21:00.066
Both. Sam Loomis used a Web site to
make the Just Roommates video, boss.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.476
The link is to a viral ad campaign.

21:02.500 --> 21:06.926
The site lets you upload your own footage and
randomly cuts in images it grabs from your photo file.

21:06.950 --> 21:10.746
Right. The instant music video
killer must've used it for his video.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.586
- How many, uh...
- Hits.

21:13.610 --> 21:19.316
Uh, this site doesn't log IP addresses, so
we're going to have to go through them by hand.

21:19.340 --> 21:21.656
It still doesn't let
Loomis off the hook.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.610
We're running his alibi right now for the
night of the murders. Should we bring him in?

21:28.920 --> 21:31.140
Let you know.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.376
Aren't you going to
say hello, Agent Gibbs?

21:39.400 --> 21:40.226
Hello.

21:40.250 --> 21:43.486
You won't be able to trace
this call. Not where I am.

21:43.510 --> 21:44.726
Yeah? Where's that?

21:44.750 --> 21:48.036
I'm sure you'd like to know, but
I'm not going to make it easy.

21:48.060 --> 21:49.676
Not for someone like you.

21:49.700 --> 21:56.216
A decorated Marine, Six-time recipient
of the Meritorious Civilian Service Award.

21:56.240 --> 21:59.016
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what, after
I bring you in, it might just be seven.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.756
I know you'll do your best to find me.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.416
I've been looking for you
a long time, Agent Gibbs.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.766
I expect no less.

22:06.790 --> 22:08.576
How's the trace coming?

22:08.600 --> 22:10.216
It's a voice-over IP, boss.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.566
He's bouncing it all over the world.

22:11.590 --> 22:14.526
So determined, so capable...

22:14.550 --> 22:16.720
You know, you and I are a lot alike.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.016
Yeah? How's that?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.036
We're both going to hell.

22:21.060 --> 22:23.886
Well, I think you should
speak for yourself.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.296
A man like you is not easy to find.

22:26.320 --> 22:30.650
And so I have something very
special planned for you, Agent Gibbs.

22:30.680 --> 22:34.150
I think you're really going to like it.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.800
Sorry, boss.

22:42.350 --> 22:43.606
Yeah, Abs, what do you got?

22:43.630 --> 22:48.370
It's another video, Gibbs. It just
popped up. I'm sending the URL now.

22:49.470 --> 22:51.156
Abs, you're sure this is the killer's?

22:51.180 --> 22:52.816
These links usually come with bodies.

22:52.840 --> 22:53.646
Yeah.

22:53.670 --> 22:58.426
I was monitoring the killer's original
CyberVid account and I caught this uploading.

22:58.450 --> 23:03.106
Oh, my God. That poster is right
outside my lab. He was here.

23:03.130 --> 23:04.566
He walked right by my lab.

23:04.590 --> 23:07.826
Abby, this isn't a flash
code. It's H-dot-two-six-four.

23:07.850 --> 23:11.256
- Hey, McGee?
- Boss, this isn't a video. It's streaming live.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.030
He's outside Abby's lab.

23:22.630 --> 23:24.276
I can see him, Gibbs.

23:24.300 --> 23:25.646
He's right outside my door.

23:25.670 --> 23:26.976
Abby, we're coming, Abs.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.956
- Lock down the entire building.
- Almost there.

23:28.980 --> 23:31.756
Meet us on level one!
Intruder may be armed.

23:31.780 --> 23:33.870
Just hurry.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.120
Freeze!

23:48.670 --> 23:50.336
Ah, hell, Harry.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.210
I'm just here to mop up.

23:55.660 --> 23:58.126
Camera's in the cart.
I'll check on Abby.

23:58.150 --> 24:00.940
Abby! It's okay. You're...

24:05.650 --> 24:07.266
Again with the Krazy Glue.

24:07.290 --> 24:08.716
Consider yourself lucky.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.956
It was either that or hydrochloric acid.

24:10.980 --> 24:11.946
Did you catch him?

24:11.970 --> 24:14.920
Well, we caught somebody.

24:16.860 --> 24:19.476
Jani-cam. That's a new one.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.676
Do you really believe Harry's involved?

24:21.700 --> 24:23.420
Gibbs will know soon enough.

24:23.450 --> 24:25.606
I've never been so
scared in my whole life.

24:25.630 --> 24:28.156
Except when my stalker-ex
tried to kill me.

24:28.180 --> 24:32.106
And when my insane assistant,
Chip, had me at knifepoint.

24:32.130 --> 24:34.586
And when McGee's crazy
fan put a gun to my head...

24:34.610 --> 24:37.230
We-we got it, Abs.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.606
How's Harry?

24:39.630 --> 24:40.786
He's innocent.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.686
He's got an alibi for both murders.

24:42.710 --> 24:45.296
Does he have any idea how the
camera got in his lunch box?

24:45.320 --> 24:46.946
He was moonlighting last month.

24:46.970 --> 24:49.706
The killer could have planted the
camera while Harry was off base.

24:49.730 --> 24:53.316
If he planted the camera a month ago, he couldn't
have known Gibbs was assigned to the case.

24:53.340 --> 24:55.936
He was targeting Gibbs
from the beginning.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.446
You must have really
pissed somebody off.

24:57.470 --> 25:00.156
It's not a short list.

25:00.180 --> 25:04.066
Of people that-that you've angered just
because you have rock-solid principles

25:04.090 --> 25:08.646
and so it's easy for people to misunderstand
that, and misconstrue. You know, people...

25:08.670 --> 25:10.516
Why don't you quit while
you're behind, DiNozzo.

25:10.540 --> 25:11.716
I'm trying.

25:11.740 --> 25:13.066
It's not about me.

25:13.090 --> 25:15.960
Whatever it was about, we've
had a serious breach in security,

25:15.990 --> 25:18.306
not to mention a serial
killer still out there.

25:18.330 --> 25:20.796
I've got a press conference
in five. How close are we?

25:20.820 --> 25:23.226
The phone call rules
out our only suspect.

25:23.250 --> 25:25.846
Sam Loomis was with us
when the killer called.

25:25.870 --> 25:28.310
Keep me updated.

25:29.360 --> 25:32.310
Somebody get McGee a new pair of shoes.

25:34.500 --> 25:35.916
Can you trace the signal, Abs?

25:35.940 --> 25:37.780
I don't even know how it was broadcast.

25:37.810 --> 25:39.966
But I'll find out.

25:39.990 --> 25:42.126
Just I have two questions.

25:42.150 --> 25:45.776
This video, it's different
than the others. Why?

25:45.800 --> 25:47.706
Okay, what's the other question?

25:47.730 --> 25:50.110
Can I stay with you tonight?

25:53.110 --> 25:57.706
That's why I have something very
special planned for you, Agent Gibbs.

25:57.730 --> 26:00.556
What do you have planned?

26:00.580 --> 26:04.160
Well, I was hoping you
could tell me, Duck.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.736
This is a fascinating
individual, Jethro.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.436
I can think of another word for him.

26:09.460 --> 26:11.036
Yeah, crazy.

26:11.060 --> 26:15.176
Well, the precise term is
narcissistic personality disorder.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.040
Oh, yeah, well, I'm
familiar with that, too.

26:18.350 --> 26:24.836
Yes, but where Agent DiNozzo has an excessive
need for admiration, he has empathy as well...

26:24.860 --> 26:26.926
Something our killer lacks.

26:26.950 --> 26:28.310
It's all a game to him.

26:28.340 --> 26:30.526
Yes, and one he has
chosen to play with you.

26:30.550 --> 26:32.506
I noticed.

26:32.530 --> 26:33.216
Why?

26:33.240 --> 26:38.466
Like all narcissists, he believes
himself to be the hero of his own story.

26:38.490 --> 26:40.566
And all heroes need a villain.

26:40.590 --> 26:44.520
Apparently, for that
role he has cast you.

26:45.060 --> 26:46.936
Doesn't care who he kills.

26:46.960 --> 26:49.196
Well, he wants his 15 minutes.

26:49.220 --> 26:51.476
He wants to be famous.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.580
And, sadly, the more he kills.

26:53.610 --> 26:56.280
- More famous he becomes.
- Yeah.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.816
I shudder to think what he
has planned for a grand finale.

26:59.840 --> 27:02.510
Perhaps some sort of doom...

27:06.850 --> 27:09.236
Yes, I knew I'd seen that before.

27:09.260 --> 27:10.026
Duck?

27:10.050 --> 27:13.760
The killer's last clues
were quite literal.

27:14.550 --> 27:17.120
I suspect the same here.

27:17.450 --> 27:22.476
That countdown likely refers
to the time of the next murder.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.526
Need something more specific than that.

27:24.550 --> 27:27.630
Yeah, well, this is the doomsday clock;

27:27.660 --> 27:32.336
It's a symbol of how close the human
race is to nuclear annihilation.

27:32.360 --> 27:37.306
The clock time changes with
the geopolitical situation.

27:37.330 --> 27:41.200
It's currently set to
five minutes to midnight.

27:42.830 --> 27:45.450
Less than three hours from now.

27:47.270 --> 27:49.446
If Ducky's right, we're
already out of time.

27:49.470 --> 27:52.396
If Ducky's right, then the murder
location is in one of the other two clues.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.676
- Ziva.
- I will send alerts to all churches in the area.

27:54.700 --> 27:57.296
- DiNozzo.
- Uh, shipyards, harbors, and Navy.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.570
- McGee.
- Yeah, boss?

27:59.820 --> 28:01.046
Hey, Lou, it's DiNozzo.

28:01.070 --> 28:04.676
Oh, um, well, I don't know.
Tony and Ziva got the easy ones.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.350
Phone call, McGee.

28:06.390 --> 28:09.650
Right. Still working on
back-tracing the killer's call.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.206
Something wrong, boss?

28:20.230 --> 28:21.526
He's playing with us.

28:21.550 --> 28:23.840
He's been playing with us.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.406
Got us doing exactly
what he wants us to do.

28:29.430 --> 28:31.810
What choice do we have?

28:34.140 --> 28:36.206
You want to evacuate the Navy Yard?

28:36.230 --> 28:37.326
He's coming here.

28:37.350 --> 28:39.510
How do you know?

28:40.600 --> 28:41.946
That could mean anything.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.166
It means his next victim is
going to be in the Navy Yard.

28:45.190 --> 28:48.616
Gibbs, I don't know if you've noticed,
but we run the Navy out of the Navy Yard,

28:48.640 --> 28:50.866
and you just want to abandon
ship based on a hunch?

28:50.890 --> 28:55.356
The camera in Harry's cart...
Video wasn't for us. It's for him.

28:55.380 --> 28:57.376
You think that was recon.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.896
Killer was scouting the base?

28:59.920 --> 29:03.070
NCIS I get, but why
evacuate the whole Yard?

29:03.100 --> 29:06.496
You can't kill anybody, Leon,
if there's no one here to kill.

29:06.520 --> 29:09.266
All right, I'll give you
points for the unexpected.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.996
We were going to run a security
lockdown drill next week.

29:12.020 --> 29:13.546
Move it up.

29:13.570 --> 29:16.480
Not sure if I hope
you're right or wrong.

29:20.070 --> 29:21.036
Yeah, McGee.

29:21.060 --> 29:24.616
Boss, I was running the killer's call through
a spectrum analyzer and I noticed that...

29:24.640 --> 29:26.156
McGee.

29:26.180 --> 29:29.826
The call... the killer wasn't actually
on the line. It was a recording.

29:29.850 --> 29:31.496
Recording? What do you mean a recording?

29:31.520 --> 29:32.936
Sounded like a conversation.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.586
He must have prerecorded segments.

29:34.610 --> 29:37.386
Used your voice to trigger
generalized responses.

29:37.410 --> 29:39.606
Could have been anywhere. Anybody.

29:39.630 --> 29:40.766
Not anybody.

29:40.790 --> 29:42.306
Abby's been working on the jani-cam.

29:42.330 --> 29:45.020
She was able to get
a print off the lens.

29:46.510 --> 29:48.486
Explains the timing of
the kilr's call to you.

29:48.510 --> 29:50.826
Loomis had it prerecorded
in case we got too close.

29:50.850 --> 29:55.340
What better way to look innocent than have
the killer call while he was in our presence?

29:55.650 --> 29:58.440
Alibi doesn't check out.

29:58.760 --> 30:01.090
Boss.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.030
Five minutes to spare.

30:16.500 --> 30:19.866
Boy, you guys must really
not have any other suspects.

30:19.890 --> 30:22.400
Oh, we got enough.

30:24.890 --> 30:25.966
Where'd you get that?

30:25.990 --> 30:27.386
Look familiar?

30:27.410 --> 30:29.656
Yeah, I used to shoot
time-lapse shots with it.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.996
It got stolen from my
place about a month ago.

30:32.020 --> 30:32.976
Did you report it?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.780
No. I fired my cleaning lady.

30:46.550 --> 30:50.356
What? It's hot in here.

30:50.380 --> 30:51.686
Feels fine to me.

30:51.710 --> 30:53.946
Man's got an uncanny ability.

30:53.970 --> 30:55.516
Should run his own sweat lodge.

30:55.540 --> 30:56.586
Tell me about Billy Cole.

30:56.610 --> 31:00.036
Look, talk to Sally Hardesty
at Sunshine Retirement.

31:00.060 --> 31:03.616
I was with her at the
time of the murders.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.626
She said she doesn't remember.

31:05.650 --> 31:11.380
She's old. You know, she never
remembers my name. Just, uh...

31:14.530 --> 31:17.196
you ask her about Magic Fingers.

31:17.220 --> 31:20.870
Oh, boy. It's all you, probie.

31:22.660 --> 31:25.460
I hear you're good on a computer.

31:26.340 --> 31:27.840
What, is that a crime now?

31:27.870 --> 31:31.380
Well, depends on what you're doing.

31:34.100 --> 31:37.650
This how you reinvented yourself, Sam?

31:40.090 --> 31:43.166
You-you got no right to do this to me!

31:43.190 --> 31:44.256
Sit down.

31:44.280 --> 31:48.856
I pay my taxes. I could have... my
whole life I've done what I've been told.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.946
- I'm a good person!
- Something's wrong.

31:50.970 --> 31:51.846
Sit down!

31:51.870 --> 31:53.956
I will not sit down!

31:53.980 --> 31:57.390
I didn't do anything wrong!

32:00.830 --> 32:02.526
Help me.

32:02.550 --> 32:05.050
Call Base medical.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.876
EMS is on the way.

32:13.900 --> 32:15.920
Tony.

32:32.040 --> 32:35.156
The Virgin Mary he's not, Jethro.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.286
He was poisoned.

32:37.310 --> 32:42.780
Abby found traces of fludrocortisone in
a patch he wore on his skin for arthritis.

32:42.810 --> 32:46.316
It made his blood pressure
skyrocket, which in turn...

32:46.340 --> 32:47.856
Heart attack.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.226
Well, that's putting it mildly.

32:50.250 --> 32:50.966
His eyes?

32:50.990 --> 32:53.586
That's a result of the
increase in vascular pressure.

32:53.610 --> 32:55.796
No doubt done for dramatic effect.

32:55.820 --> 32:58.410
Our killer is nothing, if not a showman.

32:58.440 --> 32:59.586
Nice timing.

32:59.610 --> 33:05.590
Yeah, well, the advantage of a transdermal
delivery system is that it's remarkably precise.

33:06.840 --> 33:11.516
Jethro, it's not every day that
you suffer a setback in a case.

33:11.540 --> 33:12.810
Setback?

33:12.840 --> 33:14.746
This man died in your custody.

33:14.770 --> 33:16.566
Was murdered in my custody.

33:16.590 --> 33:18.746
Exactly, right under your nose.

33:18.770 --> 33:21.156
I can imagine how you must feel.

33:21.180 --> 33:22.266
What's your point?

33:22.290 --> 33:26.856
My concern is that the
killer knows how you feel.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.616
He's pushing you for some reason.

33:28.640 --> 33:32.406
You're the arch enemy in this
narrative that he's constructed.

33:32.430 --> 33:37.310
One cannot help but wonder:
Towards what is he pushing you?

33:41.010 --> 33:43.036
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- More bad news, boss.

33:43.060 --> 33:44.970
I'll be right up.

33:46.140 --> 33:48.550
Oh, no.

33:51.620 --> 33:53.496
Fourth video just appeared, boss.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.290
He's using a proxy server in China.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.546
I'm running a snooper now, but
I wouldn't hold your breath.

33:57.570 --> 33:59.410
Let's see it.

34:00.660 --> 34:03.686
I guess you really must
not have any other suspects.

34:03.710 --> 34:06.720
That's the camera in
our interrogation room.

34:08.909 --> 34:11.230
It's hot in here.

34:12.429 --> 34:15.186
You got no right to do this to me.

34:15.210 --> 34:17.206
Sit down.

34:17.230 --> 34:21.040
No, I will not sit down.
I did nothing wrong.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.480
Help me.

34:35.210 --> 34:37.326
Is this supposed to
mean you're next, boss?

34:37.350 --> 34:40.036
The killer's never shown
the victim's face before.

34:40.060 --> 34:41.966
We will not let anything
happen to you, Gibbs...

34:41.989 --> 34:42.775
if you want, I can...

34:42.800 --> 34:47.085
What I want is to know
how he got that footage.

34:47.110 --> 34:50.556
He has it because we sent it to him.

34:50.580 --> 34:54.179
And by "we", I mean me.

34:56.190 --> 35:01.086
I was trying to figure out how the killer was
broadcasting a live stream through Harry's jani-cam,

35:01.110 --> 35:05.450
and I uploaded the firmware to
try to track it, and I got herpes.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.396
She means a computer virus, boss.

35:08.420 --> 35:11.966
Um, yeah, and the camera then uploaded
a Trojan horse to the mainframe

35:11.990 --> 35:14.266
that hijacked our
internal security system.

35:14.290 --> 35:17.936
It's been cyber-casting our interrogation
room cameras for over 24 hours.

35:17.960 --> 35:18.976
Disable it.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.986
Oh, I did. I'm just...
I'm so sorry, Gibbs.

35:22.010 --> 35:23.200
Not your fault, Abby.

35:23.230 --> 35:26.060
It's your face on there,
Gibbs. You're the next victim.

35:26.410 --> 35:28.026
I'm not anyone's victim.

35:28.050 --> 35:30.990
You could be dying of poison right now.

35:31.460 --> 35:34.990
The killer could have put a
bomb in your cell phone, Gibbs.

35:38.980 --> 35:41.336
Okay. No bomb, but still...

35:41.360 --> 35:43.626
we don't know what this video means.

35:43.650 --> 35:46.376
We know that someone's gonna
die in less than an hour.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.066
Trojan horse... can you trace it?

35:48.090 --> 35:50.956
I tried, Gibbs. I couldn't
even trace the jani-cam.

35:50.980 --> 35:53.006
I mean, the killer is bouncing signals.

35:53.030 --> 35:55.580
Did you try both together?

35:56.870 --> 35:58.486
You are a god amongst men.

35:58.510 --> 36:01.306
The jani-cam and the Trojan
horse are outgoing sources.

36:01.330 --> 36:02.606
Now we have two.

36:02.630 --> 36:03.706
If we turn them both on...

36:03.730 --> 36:06.790
We can triangulate back to the killer.

36:07.950 --> 36:11.510
Or you could just stand
there looking at me.

36:12.950 --> 36:14.016
Releasing the Trojan horse.

36:14.040 --> 36:15.746
Re-initializing the camera.

36:15.770 --> 36:17.786
Carrier signals are broadcasting.

36:17.810 --> 36:20.226
Trying to hide behind the
Great Firewall of China, but...

36:20.250 --> 36:21.406
We got 'em.

36:21.430 --> 36:25.870
Video is being rerouted to
a DSL account registered to...

36:26.840 --> 36:28.446
Rose Woodhouse.

36:28.470 --> 36:30.626
Local LEOs are at Rose's place.

36:30.650 --> 36:32.096
Neighbors say she just left.

36:32.120 --> 36:34.256
Hasn't seen the roommate
in two days, and boss...

36:34.280 --> 36:35.916
there's blood all over his room.

36:35.940 --> 36:39.550
No recent credit card
activity, but I did find this.

36:40.290 --> 36:42.416
Rose registered this
trademark two weeks ago.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.476
CyberVid Killer.

36:43.500 --> 36:47.456
Smart... imagine how much money Manson would
have made if he owned the name, Helter Skelter.

36:47.480 --> 36:50.226
Gets better: Her father
was an Egyptologist.

36:50.250 --> 36:53.996
Oh, well, that explains the savvy
with the nose-pick from hell.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.410
Killer's last video.

36:57.530 --> 37:00.440
Whatever it means, we've got less
than 30 minutes to figure it out.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.126
If it means Gibbs is the victim,
then we should just stay right here.

37:03.150 --> 37:03.976
And if I'm not?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Someone else dies.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.326
Where is that?

37:08.350 --> 37:10.246
Sears Tower. Chicago.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.670
Moscow.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.476
Rio.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.406
Death by jet lag?

37:15.430 --> 37:18.380
The clue is not the city.

37:19.330 --> 37:22.020
Clue is the snow.

37:22.620 --> 37:25.406
Boss, I am not a god among men, you are.

37:25.430 --> 37:28.386
I've got it. Now, my CPU is too small.

37:28.410 --> 37:29.686
I'm gonna let that slide.

37:29.710 --> 37:32.610
I'm gonna need a little
more time to figure it out.

37:33.270 --> 37:34.686
Well, it is the CyberVid Killer.

37:34.710 --> 37:37.560
If McGee wasn't meant to do
the heavy lifting, who was?

37:38.100 --> 37:41.630
This is the only video
that's contained flash frames.

37:42.730 --> 37:45.496
That is radiographic static,
commonly referred to as...

37:45.520 --> 37:46.556
Snow.

37:46.580 --> 37:49.176
But it just looks like snow.
It's actually encrypted data.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.780
There's another link
embedded in the snow.

37:53.310 --> 37:56.740
It's a live video link.

38:00.510 --> 38:03.276
There's the roommate. At
least he's still alive.

38:03.300 --> 38:04.326
For now.

38:04.350 --> 38:07.056
Got our next murder weapon. Shotgun.

38:07.080 --> 38:10.120
And location: That was Loomis's place.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.656
We will go.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.376
If you are the intended victim, this
may just be a way to lure you out.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.710
It's working.

38:19.240 --> 38:20.726
Less than two minutes.

38:20.750 --> 38:23.030
McGee, Ziva.

38:24.940 --> 38:26.576
Really wish you'd
stayed in the car, boss.

38:26.600 --> 38:30.300
DiNozzo, will you shut
up or I'm gonna shoot you.

38:35.950 --> 38:38.586
- NCIS!
- Drop your weapon, Rose.

38:38.610 --> 38:41.400
I wish I could. I'm sorry.

38:43.220 --> 38:44.816
We wilshoot you.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.586
Shoot her! She's freaking crazy!

38:46.610 --> 38:48.760
Drop it.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.996
Please just leave.

38:52.020 --> 38:54.616
Somebody shoot her!
Please, I don't want to die.

38:54.640 --> 38:58.060
You have three seconds,
or we will shoot.

39:03.830 --> 39:06.220
Uh, boss?

39:06.820 --> 39:09.810
What the hell are you doing?

39:11.180 --> 39:12.656
Put the gun down, Rose.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.056
He said he'd kill me.

39:14.080 --> 39:17.030
Are you crazy? Shoot her. Come on!

39:17.470 --> 39:20.390
Only one I'm gonna shoot is you.

39:32.340 --> 39:33.926
It's a dead man's switch.

39:33.950 --> 39:37.280
I've got her wired with C-4.

39:37.550 --> 39:41.100
So you shoot me, and we all die.

39:52.250 --> 39:54.576
Come on, Gibbs, do
you really want to die?

39:54.600 --> 39:56.640
Do you?

39:58.600 --> 40:02.100
No, you want to be famous.
You don't want to die.

40:13.050 --> 40:15.790
Get this the hell off me!

40:18.170 --> 40:21.240
All right, just hold still.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.806
NCIS.

40:24.830 --> 40:27.226
I knew I should have gone with the FBI.

40:27.250 --> 40:31.486
It's clich\, but, look what you
get for trying something different.

40:31.510 --> 40:32.886
Clear.

40:32.910 --> 40:36.016
He said if I didn't just
stand there, he'd kill me.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.466
You said we were shooting
another music video!

40:38.490 --> 40:40.226
I hope you fry!

40:40.250 --> 40:42.976
Come on, Rose. Come on, let's go.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.230
He set her up. How did you know?

40:47.080 --> 40:49.426
The video camera?

40:49.450 --> 40:51.666
Yes, they had one of
those at every murder.

40:51.690 --> 40:53.846
On the victim.

40:53.870 --> 40:56.810
Eye was the murder weapon.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.166
Total clich\, you know.

40:59.190 --> 41:01.126
You ripped that off from Se7en.

41:01.150 --> 41:03.026
Wrong!

41:03.050 --> 41:07.206
At the end of Se7en, the cops killed
the serial killer, not another victim.

41:07.230 --> 41:11.090
It's totally different!

41:17.060 --> 41:21.250
Doesn't matter. I still win.

41:22.290 --> 41:23.796
You?

41:23.820 --> 41:28.180
You may be the famous
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

41:29.030 --> 41:31.386
But you're...

41:31.410 --> 41:34.610
You're nothing but a set piece.

41:36.490 --> 41:40.340
Who caught Gacy, huh? Manson?

41:40.750 --> 41:44.610
I don't know. But Tommy Doyle?

41:44.950 --> 41:50.080
Oh, he's gonna be a household
name by the 10:00 news.

41:54.630 --> 41:58.026
Authorities say the CyberVid
Killer is in custody.

41:58.050 --> 42:02.260
However, citing possible links to terrorism,
officials are not releasing his identity,

42:02.290 --> 42:04.616
and details of how they arrested
him are being kept under wraps...

42:04.640 --> 42:07.850
Thank you and congratulations.

42:09.670 --> 42:12.126
Way to go, Marie.

42:12.150 --> 42:15.646
Our sources believe we may
never know his real name.

42:15.670 --> 42:16.856
Yeah, that's got to hurt.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.196
All that for a question mark.

42:19.220 --> 42:25.526
It's very revealing the lengths that some men
will go to thrust themselves into the limelight,

42:25.550 --> 42:28.476
while others are content
to live quietly...

42:28.500 --> 42:30.296
- in solitude.
- The next award to be presented

42:30.320 --> 42:35.476
is the Meritorious Civilian Service
Award for demonstrating unusual initiative

42:35.500 --> 42:38.080
and a pattern of excellence.

42:39.580 --> 42:43.640
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

42:46.050 --> 42:48.080
Agent Gibbs.
