00:34.868 --> 00:39.896
There was a time when the world was
plunging into darkness and chaos.

00:40.273 --> 00:43.174
A time of witchcraft and sorcery.

00:44.677 --> 00:47.510
A time when no-one stood against evil.

01:02.195 --> 01:03.628
Fire!

01:34.461 --> 01:35.553
Yes?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.983
Where is the throne room?

03:01.714 --> 03:02.874
No?

03:14.294 --> 03:16.819
Good lad. Good lad.

03:17.997 --> 03:19.362
Now...

03:20.733 --> 03:24.794
...Iet not one of these
putrid heathens live.

04:13.453 --> 04:15.011
There's something in here with us.

04:15.021 --> 04:16.750
No treasure is worth this.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.224
Silence, you dogs.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.256
Hold steady!

04:59.966 --> 05:02.628
Captain, there's devilry here,
I knew it.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.495
I said, "hold steady".

05:10.143 --> 05:12.873
I am the only devil here!

05:18.685 --> 05:20.209
Now...

05:21.321 --> 05:22.879
...follow me!

05:33.433 --> 05:35.367
Here it is, boys!

05:35.534 --> 05:36.967
I've found it.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.609
Malthus!

05:53.553 --> 05:55.612
Solomon.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.920
Solomon.

07:32.351 --> 07:33.875
Killer.

07:40.092 --> 07:41.457
Solomon.

07:41.561 --> 07:45.190
What-- are you?

07:50.970 --> 07:54.030
I am the Devil's Reaper.

07:56.008 --> 08:00.945
I am here to claim you,
Solomon Kane.

08:02.114 --> 08:05.880
Your deal is done.

08:06.219 --> 08:09.017
What deal?
I made no deal.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.883
There was a deal...

08:11.891 --> 08:15.725
...and your soul is the price.

08:15.728 --> 08:18.288
Your life of murder...

08:18.297 --> 08:22.393
...and greed is over.

08:22.735 --> 08:25.169
You cannot take my soul.

08:25.238 --> 08:28.674
Bow your head before me.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.679
The Devil will have his due.

08:43.688 --> 08:44.815
No!

08:45.490 --> 08:51.190
You can tell your master
that I am not yet ready for Hell.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.587
The Lord protects me.

08:53.599 --> 08:57.695
Fool! He has abandoned you.

09:01.908 --> 09:03.830
On your knees.

09:03.843 --> 09:07.438
Never!
You'll never take my soul!

09:07.446 --> 09:09.243
Take his soul.

09:10.482 --> 09:11.540
Never!

09:14.220 --> 09:17.246
You cannot escape us.

09:17.990 --> 09:22.256
Your soul is damned!

09:50.056 --> 09:51.148
Solomon?

10:08.941 --> 10:10.568
Who's the novice?

10:11.577 --> 10:13.397
This is Brother Thomas.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.812
He joined us only a few days ago.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.550
Those marks, do they--

10:19.652 --> 10:21.279
--really protect you from Satan?

10:21.287 --> 10:24.017
Mind what you name
in this holy place.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.120
I would like to speak
with Solomon alone.

10:30.296 --> 10:34.198
Once again we heard
your cries at matins.

10:35.201 --> 10:39.797
My dreams.
My dreams do haunt me still.

10:39.905 --> 10:43.932
You would do well to listen to
what your dreams tell you.

10:44.243 --> 10:45.301
I do.

10:46.812 --> 10:50.543
My dreams tell me only
that I am damned.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.942
God protects His own.

10:53.719 --> 10:56.415
I am not one of His own...

10:57.356 --> 10:58.846
...am l?

11:01.360 --> 11:03.521
My enemies are...

11:04.330 --> 11:06.696
...are ever watchful of me.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.160
But this place...

11:10.102 --> 11:13.731
...this place and these prayers...

11:13.739 --> 11:15.331
...symbols...

11:17.610 --> 11:21.205
...they are all that hide me
from its gaze.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.114
Solomon...

11:24.917 --> 11:27.909
...these months you've been here...

11:28.254 --> 11:30.745
...I've felt a shadow growing over us.

11:30.756 --> 11:33.122
These are dark times.

11:33.225 --> 11:38.959
I prayed for guidance--
and I was answered.

11:40.966 --> 11:44.834
Solomon-- you must leave us.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.671
Why? I...

11:48.307 --> 11:52.710
...I live here in solitude.
I do no harm.

11:53.312 --> 11:56.748
I've renounced my evil ways,
my power.

11:57.349 --> 12:01.410
I'm learning...
Iearning to be a man of peace.

12:01.420 --> 12:06.448
I know you are, but your future
is not here with us.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.687
How could you do this to me?

12:10.329 --> 12:14.060
I have given all my wealth to the Church.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.763
We're grateful for your generosity,
but you must understand...

12:17.770 --> 12:19.829
No. Father.

12:21.273 --> 12:26.267
Do not-- do not make me beg.

12:27.947 --> 12:32.441
This place is a--
is a sanctuary to me.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.654
Where would you have me go?

12:38.657 --> 12:40.284
You must go home.

12:42.661 --> 12:43.923
Home?

12:44.029 --> 12:45.155
You're of noble birth...

12:45.164 --> 12:48.793
...you have lands in the west,
you must return to your inheritance.

12:50.336 --> 12:51.064
Solomon...

12:51.070 --> 12:55.029
No! I cannot return home.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.243
Nor can you remain.

13:27.339 --> 13:30.604
I was told in my dreams
he was to be sent from here.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.631
I listen to what I'm told.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.307
Does Kane know his purpose?

13:36.282 --> 13:39.342
Every man must discover
his own destiny.

13:39.618 --> 13:42.314
Kane must find his purpose.

13:42.621 --> 13:45.055
There are many paths to redemption.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.786
Not all of them peaceful.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.073
Pilgrim!

15:16.949 --> 15:18.177
Offer you a ride?

15:18.183 --> 15:19.480
Thanks, friend, but no.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.680
Well, the road ahead should
not be travelled alone.

15:21.687 --> 15:23.882
Again, I'll thank you
for your offer.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.015
I'll be walking.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.447
As you wish.
God be with you.

15:27.459 --> 15:28.847
And with you too, sir.

15:28.861 --> 15:29.885
Ma'am.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.322
- He'll hear us.
- I don't care.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.692
Let him hear me.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.169
Move and you die.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.245
I don't want any trouble.

16:26.251 --> 16:29.379
Well, that's too bad.
Because you've already got it!

16:32.891 --> 16:34.085
Let's have a look.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.087
Nothing worth stealing.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.824
Nothing? You got nothing?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.786
- Are you a priest?
- Just take what you want.

16:39.798 --> 16:42.562
Oh, don't you worry,
pilgrim, we will.

16:43.836 --> 16:44.757
Stay still.

16:44.770 --> 16:48.035
Look at this.
These are magical symbols.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.604
I say he's a sorcerer.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.143
What shall we do with you, eh?

16:53.345 --> 16:55.643
Shall we burn you as a witch?

16:57.483 --> 16:59.781
Burn him! Burn him!

17:05.156 --> 17:08.183
There's murder
in your eyes, traveller.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.824
Would you kill me? Eh?

17:14.465 --> 17:16.058
Huh? Would you?

17:17.903 --> 17:19.097
No.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.364
What?

17:22.273 --> 17:25.071
You won't kill the man
who steals from you?!

17:27.512 --> 17:29.946
I will not fight another man.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.814
I have renounced violence.

17:33.018 --> 17:35.953
Well, that's a shame
because we haven't.

17:38.957 --> 17:41.448
You will do as I say, Solomon.

17:41.627 --> 17:46.223
Don't forget your place.
You are the second son only.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.062
Marcus is my heir.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.597
He will be master of these
lands on my death.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.033
But, Father,
Marcus is a brute and a bully!

17:53.038 --> 17:56.633
You will take holy orders and
join the Church as I command.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.803
But I do not want to be a priest.

17:58.811 --> 18:02.338
What you want is of no importance.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.373
Father Simnal is here to
take you to the abbey.

18:06.385 --> 18:07.943
I won't go.

18:08.454 --> 18:11.651
If you defy me,
you will have nothing.

18:20.199 --> 18:21.894
I will cut you off.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.195
You will be a landless vagrant.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.330
Is that what you want?

18:29.875 --> 18:32.776
Walk out now and
you may never return.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.246
Do not defy me!

18:40.385 --> 18:41.682
Be calm.

18:42.321 --> 18:45.722
Be calm, sir.
Be calm, you are safe.

18:48.927 --> 18:51.487
He's awake.
Father!

18:51.763 --> 18:53.754
Father, that man, he's awake.

18:54.199 --> 18:57.635
Here-- take a drink
of water if you can.

19:01.506 --> 19:03.064
Careful. Careful.

19:03.242 --> 19:04.163
Meredith.

19:04.176 --> 19:05.768
His fever has broken, Father.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.369
Thank the Lord, sir.

19:07.379 --> 19:10.303
You will be well.
My name is Crowthorn.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.612
William Crowthorn.

19:11.616 --> 19:13.675
My daughter Meredith
has been tending you.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.846
The good Lord must be
watching over you, sir.

19:15.854 --> 19:17.981
He guided us to your rescue.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.647
Edward, pull over.

19:20.058 --> 19:22.492
We'll find a place to make
camp for the night.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.027
Shall I put these down here, Mother?

19:30.035 --> 19:31.798
Yes, thank you, Meredith.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.195
Step lively, Meredith.

19:45.484 --> 19:46.576
Samuel.

19:47.886 --> 19:49.080
Water the horses.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.008
Why me?

19:50.022 --> 19:51.512
Your older brother
has given you a task.

19:51.522 --> 19:53.217
See you set to it.

19:58.630 --> 20:01.895
Master Kane.
You should be resting.

20:02.067 --> 20:05.298
I can hardly repay
your hospitality.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.502
...with idleness, Ma'am.

20:10.642 --> 20:15.136
Give me a few moments to clean up,
I'll come and help you as I can.

20:56.522 --> 20:59.286
You've regained your appetite,
Master Kane.

21:01.360 --> 21:05.023
It's a fine meal,
Mistress Crowthorn.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.952
My Katherine can make
anything taste good.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.796
Leather boots and nettles last Sunday.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.119
It certainly was not!

21:10.135 --> 21:11.500
Tasted like it.

21:14.072 --> 21:16.404
William tells us you were
Captain of a ship.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.633
Yeah.

21:18.877 --> 21:20.242
That I was.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.970
Did you fight the Spanish?

21:21.980 --> 21:23.106
I did.

21:23.415 --> 21:24.746
Who else?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.316
Seem to have fought
everyone at some time.

21:32.623 --> 21:34.818
I've had many masters.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.787
Once voyaged with Admiral Drake.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.757
Admiral Drake!

21:40.832 --> 21:42.629
That did not end well.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.862
Must have been so exciting.

21:46.872 --> 21:49.397
Seeing the world and
learning new things.

21:49.408 --> 21:51.000
Why do you think
a life of violence

21:51.009 --> 21:52.931
and bloodshed is
so admirable, Meredith?

21:52.944 --> 21:55.276
You know that's not what I meant.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.168
Why do you always argue with me?

21:57.182 --> 21:58.513
Because you need to learn what to...

21:58.518 --> 22:01.351
- I fought in the Queen's Army once.
- Yeah?

22:01.353 --> 22:03.412
Before I found my faith.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.619
Taking another man's life,

22:07.225 --> 22:10.319
that's not an easy thing to do,
don't you agree?

22:12.631 --> 22:14.929
I must confess, Mr Crowthorn...

22:17.135 --> 22:19.968
...I was never more at home
than I was in battle.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.034
Killing-- came easily to me.

22:37.789 --> 22:41.020
Ifyou defy me,
you will have nothing.

22:41.727 --> 22:44.560
Walk out now and
you may never return.

22:44.663 --> 22:46.255
Do not defy me!

22:59.378 --> 23:00.402
Stop!

23:00.412 --> 23:01.504
Please!

23:01.513 --> 23:02.810
- Please, help me! No!
- Shut up!

23:02.814 --> 23:03.872
Stop!

23:04.216 --> 23:06.241
Marcus, what are you doing?

23:06.251 --> 23:07.980
Solomon, I thought you'd run away.

23:07.986 --> 23:09.510
Fleeing the life of a holy man.

23:09.521 --> 23:11.318
- Solomon, he tried to...
- Quiet!

23:11.857 --> 23:13.984
- I gave you no leave to speak!
- Sarah, run!

23:15.026 --> 23:17.426
This is not your concern,
little brother.

23:19.698 --> 23:22.724
Since you're going away,
here's something to remember me by.

23:24.002 --> 23:25.560
Come here and look at this!

23:25.570 --> 23:26.832
I am the first-born!

23:26.838 --> 23:30.706
All this will be mine and
you'll have nothing!

23:30.709 --> 23:33.337
Take your bags and leave this land.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.678
Marcus!

23:42.320 --> 23:43.981
Friend. Friend.

23:45.123 --> 23:47.011
Please, sit down. Join me.

23:47.025 --> 23:47.923
Thank you.

23:52.063 --> 23:53.428
How are you feeling?

23:53.665 --> 23:55.792
Aches, bruises. Nothing.

23:56.034 --> 23:58.594
Your daughter has a healer's gift.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.428
She does indeed.

24:00.872 --> 24:02.396
Just like her mother.

24:06.011 --> 24:09.538
Two most beautiful women
in this world, Master Kane.

24:09.648 --> 24:11.912
My family is all and everything to me.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.282
You are blessed.

24:15.854 --> 24:17.219
Do you have kin?

24:17.355 --> 24:18.947
I had a brother.

24:20.692 --> 24:22.592
But that was a lifetime ago now.

24:23.929 --> 24:25.692
We've lost loved ones.

24:25.764 --> 24:29.131
To plague, persecution and bigotry.

24:30.001 --> 24:34.700
Well, Edward, now.
He-- had a wife and child once.

24:34.706 --> 24:37.368
But the Lord saw fit to embrace them.

24:41.512 --> 24:45.107
So-- now you sail
for the New World, huh?

24:45.116 --> 24:47.016
Yes, indeed, we do.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.778
Sometimes...

24:50.055 --> 24:52.182
...we all need to start again.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.623
You might consider joining us.

24:56.862 --> 25:00.855
Well, that's a--
that's a kind offer, William.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.764
Thank you. Very kind.

25:03.902 --> 25:05.733
I should be honest with you.

25:05.937 --> 25:09.270
You should know the kind of man
you're thinking about taking in.

25:10.275 --> 25:12.402
I've done bad things.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.003
Terrible things.

25:15.614 --> 25:18.174
Cruel things.

25:20.151 --> 25:21.516
I am a...

25:22.954 --> 25:24.751
No, I was...

25:26.491 --> 25:27.958
...was an evil--

25:29.327 --> 25:30.794
--evil man.

25:31.930 --> 25:36.162
But the Lord speaks of redemption
and forgiveness.

25:36.268 --> 25:39.635
No. My soul is damned.

25:39.738 --> 25:44.232
Satan's creatures will take me
should I stray from the path of peace.

25:44.809 --> 25:46.777
Then do not stray...

25:48.613 --> 25:49.978
...Master Kane.

25:52.317 --> 25:54.046
Do not stray.

26:23.715 --> 26:25.080
Captain Kane?

26:25.417 --> 26:26.645
Yes, Miss?

26:26.952 --> 26:29.546
I made these clothes-- for you.

26:29.620 --> 26:31.611
Your others are a little...

26:33.658 --> 26:35.182
A little what, Miss?

26:35.293 --> 26:36.624
A little...

26:37.929 --> 26:39.226
...worn.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.667
Thank you, Miss.

26:47.839 --> 26:48.897
Thank you.

26:59.017 --> 27:01.815
Now there stands a fine figure of a man.
Don't you think, William?

27:01.820 --> 27:04.653
It's better than those rags
you were wearing, and that's a fact.

27:04.655 --> 27:06.680
I'm glad you approve, Ma'am.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.782
Finally, you're respectable.

27:09.728 --> 27:13.027
Been a long time since anybody said
that about me.

27:14.165 --> 27:15.393
Thank you.

27:27.112 --> 27:28.943
Are you coming to America with us?

27:29.047 --> 27:30.878
I'm not so sure, Samuel.

27:30.882 --> 27:31.974
Why?

27:32.050 --> 27:33.244
Well...

27:34.319 --> 27:37.254
...you and your family are
beginning a new life.

27:37.889 --> 27:40.551
Whereas I need to undo an old one.

27:40.558 --> 27:42.025
Those men who hurt you,

27:42.327 --> 27:44.591
you could have killed them
if you wanted, couldn't you?

27:44.595 --> 27:46.495
There was a time when l...

27:47.098 --> 27:51.467
...would have ripped their
still-beating hearts from their chests.

27:55.774 --> 27:57.173
Would you fight me?

27:57.308 --> 28:00.368
I will if you continue
with your infernal questioning.

28:00.478 --> 28:01.365
Fight me.

28:01.379 --> 28:03.973
I have no reason to fight you,
young man.

28:04.949 --> 28:06.905
- Samuel, stop it!
- Now you have a reason!

28:06.918 --> 28:07.737
To save this beautiful maiden from me.

28:07.752 --> 28:09.549
Samuel! Don't scare the horses.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.989
Solomon. Save me. Help!

28:12.090 --> 28:13.250
Come, sir.

28:13.925 --> 28:14.721
Come on.

28:20.398 --> 28:21.592
Samuel...

28:21.733 --> 28:23.428
...get back to the cart. Go on.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.202
Who could have done this?

29:05.210 --> 29:06.438
The Devil.

29:07.212 --> 29:08.975
The Devil was here.

29:20.458 --> 29:22.517
No, there was no Devil.

29:22.527 --> 29:24.893
There was a witch burning here.

29:26.464 --> 29:28.455
The creature must have broken free.

29:28.466 --> 29:30.991
...taken vengeance, my Lord.
Show thyself.

29:33.838 --> 29:35.032
We should leave.

29:35.473 --> 29:37.907
We can't just leave
these people for carrion.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.426
Keep her well stoked, Edward.

30:04.536 --> 30:07.004
We got to keep the shadows
at bay tonight.

30:08.940 --> 30:11.841
Child-- can you tell us what happened?

30:11.843 --> 30:14.903
Oh, let the poor girl be, William.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.137
They tried to burn a witch.

30:21.052 --> 30:23.452
People came to watch her die, but...

30:23.888 --> 30:27.085
...the flames, they didn't hurt her.

30:28.126 --> 30:31.562
She just laughed and--
she said...

30:32.030 --> 30:36.126
...she said--
that all the Devil's children...

30:36.468 --> 30:38.527
...were free to walk the earth now.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.863
And then...

30:44.442 --> 30:46.205
...she killed them all.

30:46.878 --> 30:48.937
She burnt out their eyes...

30:49.080 --> 30:51.514
...because they came to watch.

30:56.321 --> 30:57.743
We should pray.

30:57.755 --> 30:58.915
I'm tired.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.914
Just a moment more.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.477
For our prayers.

31:02.493 --> 31:04.324
I don't want to pray.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.194
It's all right, it's all right.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.894
I'm so tired. Please?

31:10.301 --> 31:12.963
Of course you are.
You poor thing.

31:13.071 --> 31:14.834
Let's find a place for you to sleep.

31:16.774 --> 31:20.642
Edward, I think the child
should wear your cross tonight.

31:21.779 --> 31:23.167
For protection.

31:23.181 --> 31:24.341
Of course.

31:25.682 --> 31:26.671
Here.

31:26.684 --> 31:27.878
Thank you.

31:29.454 --> 31:30.978
Here, child.

31:35.460 --> 31:36.927
Wear this tonight.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.390
It will keep you safe.

31:39.864 --> 31:40.990
Solomon...

31:44.569 --> 31:47.595
It's you we want.

31:51.709 --> 31:52.573
What did you do?

31:53.278 --> 31:54.768
Here, child.

31:56.047 --> 31:57.412
Her, this is the witch!

32:00.685 --> 32:03.552
The Devil is waiting for you, Kane!

32:36.554 --> 32:37.782
Bring them.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.231
Get off me!

32:52.303 --> 32:54.897
More recruits for Malachi, my Lord.

33:03.247 --> 33:06.182
Are you ready to
serve your Overlord?

33:06.184 --> 33:08.618
Better than the alternative.

33:08.786 --> 33:13.358
To serve us you have to join us.

33:13.358 --> 33:14.620
Well...

33:15.393 --> 33:17.486
...just tell us what to do.

33:30.642 --> 33:31.870
What are you doing?!

33:53.831 --> 33:55.628
It's good.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.177
Father, I have the firewood.

34:11.181 --> 34:14.344
Well done, Samuel.
Break it up now.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.918
Let me help you with that.
Give it a pull.

34:17.155 --> 34:18.850
- There we are.
- Thank you.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.952
Here-- let me see.

34:22.860 --> 34:23.679
Does that hurt?

34:23.694 --> 34:26.288
No. I can't feel anything.

34:26.630 --> 34:30.498
Why did that creature mark me?

34:32.370 --> 34:33.803
I don't know.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.862
Evil has its own reasons.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.069
Are we safe?

34:40.745 --> 34:42.303
Don't you worry.

34:42.847 --> 34:45.213
There is no evil in you, Meredith.

34:46.684 --> 34:48.208
Trust me.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.286
I trust you.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.319
Come along with that wood, Samuel.

34:53.324 --> 34:56.521
Bigger pieces than that, please.
Bigger pieces. We want hot soup.

34:56.693 --> 34:57.751
William.

35:00.231 --> 35:03.462
You might wanna set a
smaller fire tonight.

35:03.868 --> 35:06.393
Don't wanna attract
any unwanted attention.

35:40.371 --> 35:41.565
Solomon!

35:41.572 --> 35:42.322
What's the matter?

35:42.340 --> 35:44.137
- I heard something.
- Where?

35:44.242 --> 35:45.470
Over there.

35:45.476 --> 35:46.898
Beyond those trees.

35:46.911 --> 35:47.900
Wait here.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.990
Samuel, Samuel, keep down!

36:06.164 --> 36:08.394
Keep down, keep quiet!

36:08.500 --> 36:09.888
Who are they?

36:09.901 --> 36:12.461
Solomon-- what are they?

36:12.570 --> 36:15.095
I want you to go back to your father.

36:15.106 --> 36:17.233
Tell him to move out immediately.

36:19.210 --> 36:20.404
Go!

36:41.165 --> 36:42.291
Leave her!

36:44.368 --> 36:45.733
Meredith!

36:51.142 --> 36:52.336
Mother!

36:58.149 --> 37:00.549
Solomon! Solomon!

37:02.086 --> 37:03.246
Samuel!

37:25.009 --> 37:26.340
Solomon!

37:27.311 --> 37:29.006
This is the one.

37:30.781 --> 37:33.306
No! Stop! Stop!

37:33.417 --> 37:35.908
Solomon! Help us!

37:45.196 --> 37:46.618
- No!
- Samuel!

37:46.632 --> 37:48.156
No, leave him be.

37:49.367 --> 37:52.632
Leave him be.
Don't you hurt him.

37:53.170 --> 37:54.467
I am unarmed.

37:56.974 --> 37:58.601
Solomon, help him!

37:59.410 --> 38:02.106
- Solomon, kill them!
- Silence, Samuel!

38:02.446 --> 38:03.367
Kill them all!

38:03.381 --> 38:05.315
Listen to him, Samuel. Listen.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.111
Don't struggle, lad.

38:07.251 --> 38:09.617
Ifyou don't struggle,
he'll let you go.

38:10.321 --> 38:11.811
Won't you?

38:12.658 --> 38:14.421
Kill him. You know you can.

38:14.424 --> 38:17.120
Just be quiet, Samuel!

38:18.596 --> 38:19.722
You.

38:21.498 --> 38:23.056
Are you their master?

38:23.067 --> 38:25.433
What is it you want?!
I'll do anything.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.086
Kill me.

38:44.121 --> 38:45.554
Can you?

38:46.924 --> 38:49.859
No, l...I cannot.

38:51.395 --> 38:52.623
I am--

38:53.564 --> 38:55.930
--a man of peace.

38:57.868 --> 39:00.462
Don't you hurt that boy.

39:01.138 --> 39:02.935
This boy...

39:03.740 --> 39:07.676
...this child has more heart
than any of you.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.497
Help me.

39:08.512 --> 39:11.106
He is the only man here.

39:11.816 --> 39:14.376
- No, listen to me.
- Solomon, stop him!

39:15.720 --> 39:17.017
No!

39:23.127 --> 39:25.186
Samuel!

39:25.730 --> 39:27.857
My son!

39:30.234 --> 39:32.134
Take the marked one.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.568
Solomon-- do something!

39:37.908 --> 39:41.378
Help us! Kill them!
Kill them all!

39:41.379 --> 39:43.609
Solomon, please help us!

39:45.149 --> 39:47.515
What is it you want from me?

39:50.221 --> 39:51.813
What is it?

39:56.293 --> 40:00.195
Is this-- all I am to you?

40:04.468 --> 40:06.129
Then so be it.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.671
If I kill you...

40:13.210 --> 40:15.269
...I am bound for Hell.

40:18.215 --> 40:22.151
It is a price-- I shall gladly pay.

40:36.700 --> 40:37.962
Meredith!

40:39.602 --> 40:40.830
Leave her!

40:43.606 --> 40:45.301
No! William!

41:02.793 --> 41:04.021
Get off her!

41:04.028 --> 41:05.495
Meredith!

41:46.704 --> 41:47.762
Meredith!

42:08.592 --> 42:10.219
Go, go!

42:43.994 --> 42:45.859
- Solomon.
- Yeah.

42:47.064 --> 42:48.417
Get her back.

42:48.432 --> 42:49.990
Oh, I will.

42:50.301 --> 42:54.465
Get her back. Swear on oath...

42:54.772 --> 42:57.502
...to get her back-- for me.

42:58.909 --> 43:01.434
These are my last words on earth.

43:01.879 --> 43:04.473
I know God in Heaven hears.

43:05.115 --> 43:07.606
If you save our child...

43:08.486 --> 43:12.047
...your soul, too, will be saved.

43:12.189 --> 43:15.556
You can redeem yourself, Solomon.

43:15.558 --> 43:18.049
I know this to be true.

43:19.296 --> 43:21.161
Swear it to me.

43:21.799 --> 43:22.993
Swear.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.467
I swear.

43:24.568 --> 43:27.435
I swear it, William.
I will find her.

43:59.636 --> 44:01.069
Find her.

44:02.272 --> 44:03.432
Go.

45:40.804 --> 45:41.896
Get him!

46:34.592 --> 46:36.219
Meredith, are you in there?

46:38.428 --> 46:39.656
Have you seen this girl?

46:39.662 --> 46:42.495
No, no. Look at it, please.
Have you seen this girl?

46:42.498 --> 46:44.022
I don't know her, sir. Please...

46:45.068 --> 46:47.468
Where are they taking you?
Have you seen this girl?

46:47.471 --> 46:48.802
I don't know.

46:49.006 --> 46:50.598
There are raiders everywhere.
Please!

46:50.608 --> 46:52.701
No, look at this!
Have you seen this girl?!

46:52.709 --> 46:56.475
Please don't hurt me.
I just wanna go home.

46:58.749 --> 47:01.877
Forgive me, child.
Forgive me.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.018
Go, go. Go in peace.

47:15.698 --> 47:16.960
Move along.

47:30.113 --> 47:32.479
- Clear out the dead.
- They're no use to Malachi.

47:32.482 --> 47:34.950
Where are you taking us?
What do you want?

47:35.519 --> 47:39.421
Make your peace, child.
There's no way out for us.

47:39.423 --> 47:42.654
Slavery or death.
That's our only way out.

47:42.760 --> 47:44.853
God will not deliver us from this.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.352
We'll find a way out.

47:46.496 --> 47:49.829
Take my hand.
We'll find the strength to survive this.

47:49.833 --> 47:51.095
Quiet!

47:51.668 --> 47:53.101
Bring her here.

48:30.540 --> 48:32.007
Dear God.

50:21.952 --> 50:23.476
Dear God...

50:24.221 --> 50:26.485
...I beg you to listen to me now.

50:27.391 --> 50:30.952
I have failed you.
I cannot find her.

50:31.728 --> 50:33.753
I am lost...

50:34.865 --> 50:39.461
...and I need your light--
to help me find my way.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.704
Forgive me, Father.

50:45.308 --> 50:46.935
Such times we live in.

50:47.978 --> 50:51.311
I wished only for some refuge
and a moment of prayer.

50:54.917 --> 50:57.317
Praise God in His sanctuary.

50:58.121 --> 51:01.579
Praise Him in the firmament
of His power.

51:07.097 --> 51:11.966
I've seen such terrible things.

51:15.272 --> 51:16.830
So this is your home?

51:16.973 --> 51:18.565
I need nowhere else.

51:19.309 --> 51:21.641
I have nowhere else.

51:24.514 --> 51:26.209
You come far?

51:26.950 --> 51:29.817
Three days' hard ride
have brought me here.

51:31.288 --> 51:34.553
But where 'here' is I know not.

51:35.724 --> 51:38.659
These are the borderlands of
Somerset and Devonshire.

51:39.396 --> 51:40.886
My home, too.

51:40.897 --> 51:43.024
Sad homecoming for you, then.

51:44.101 --> 51:46.126
Have those Raiders been here?

51:46.136 --> 51:48.969
Those black-eyed lapdogs of Malachi?

51:48.972 --> 51:50.098
Aye...

51:50.874 --> 51:52.603
...they passed through here.

51:54.144 --> 51:58.012
Now they hold sway over
all the lands to the west of here.

52:00.016 --> 52:02.075
Then I shall be riding westward.

52:02.819 --> 52:05.117
Then you shall ride to your death,
my son.

52:06.156 --> 52:07.851
Who is this Malachi?

52:07.858 --> 52:10.190
A servant of the Devil.

52:10.460 --> 52:13.258
A sorcerer.
No-one ever sees him.

52:13.263 --> 52:14.855
He hides away in his castle...

52:14.865 --> 52:18.665
...and sends forth that
masked warrior to do his bidding.

52:18.667 --> 52:21.124
His army make slaves of the weak...

52:21.138 --> 52:23.163
...and soldiers of the strong.

52:24.074 --> 52:27.874
But God will save the faithful.

52:32.650 --> 52:34.174
It's here...

52:34.552 --> 52:36.281
...it's here, here.

52:37.454 --> 52:38.682
I have read it.

52:42.592 --> 52:44.025
I have read it.

52:48.265 --> 52:50.256
This is the end of days.

52:52.436 --> 52:54.563
You truly believe that?

52:55.338 --> 52:58.068
Every foul thing that the light
of Christ kept at bay...

52:58.074 --> 53:01.635
...is crawling up out of the pit
to curse the land.

53:03.380 --> 53:07.316
I think Christ and all his angels
have been asleep...

53:07.317 --> 53:09.080
...whilst we are left to suffer.

53:09.085 --> 53:11.349
You mind your blasphemy!

53:12.588 --> 53:15.648
It can only be as God ordains it.

53:15.724 --> 53:17.783
How can it be right...

53:18.628 --> 53:22.029
...that this evil is left to walk the earth...

53:22.332 --> 53:25.392
...whilst all we have to
protect ourselves is what?

53:26.636 --> 53:28.365
Simple faith?

53:29.539 --> 53:31.769
It is written in the scriptures.

53:37.948 --> 53:39.506
What was that?

53:43.620 --> 53:45.815
I heard something outside.

53:47.090 --> 53:48.717
No, my son.

53:49.558 --> 53:51.753
There is nothing evil out there.

53:55.698 --> 53:57.529
Evil is already here.

53:58.602 --> 54:00.126
What do you mean?

54:02.672 --> 54:03.764
Come.

54:17.486 --> 54:18.680
See?

54:25.095 --> 54:27.620
"Satan has desired to have them...

54:28.566 --> 54:31.160
...that he may sift them as wheat."

54:52.689 --> 54:54.122
My God...

54:56.460 --> 54:58.052
What was I to do?

54:59.696 --> 55:01.721
You should destroy them, man!

55:02.132 --> 55:05.124
I cannot destroy them.
They were men and women once.

55:05.135 --> 55:06.523
People I knew.

55:06.536 --> 55:10.165
Malachi's curse that
changed them is no fault of theirs.

55:10.474 --> 55:15.070
This is my flock.
I keep them.

55:16.246 --> 55:17.713
Care for them.

55:21.084 --> 55:22.711
I feed them.

55:22.952 --> 55:24.214
Feed them?

55:26.056 --> 55:27.546
With what?

55:28.224 --> 55:29.782
What do you feed them?

55:29.858 --> 55:30.825
Flesh!

55:33.562 --> 55:37.726
I deliver you unto Satan's creatures
for the destruction of your flesh...

55:37.734 --> 55:40.225
...that your spirit may be saved.

55:40.570 --> 55:43.038
May God have mercy on your soul.

57:33.917 --> 57:35.441
Friend of yours?

57:46.396 --> 57:48.261
I remember this one, lads.

57:48.398 --> 57:51.162
He's not a fighter. Remember?

57:52.434 --> 57:54.231
What are you doing here, Puritan?

57:54.237 --> 57:58.469
So-- you've given yourselves
over to this evil, have you?

57:59.542 --> 58:01.169
You should try it.

58:01.878 --> 58:04.904
Malachi will own all this land
here soon enough.

58:05.716 --> 58:07.741
There's no point in you fighting.

58:07.750 --> 58:09.911
The only thing round here is fighting.

58:10.086 --> 58:12.077
But you don't do that...

58:13.189 --> 58:14.554
...do you?

58:14.924 --> 58:16.289
Well, you know...

58:18.462 --> 58:21.158
...I may just have
changed my mind about that.

58:57.934 --> 59:00.459
No! No! What are you doing?!

59:03.072 --> 59:04.334
What are they?!

59:04.340 --> 59:07.798
Now, this girl, your kind took her.

59:08.646 --> 59:09.533
Have you seen her?

59:09.546 --> 59:10.911
I don't know her.

59:12.215 --> 59:14.615
Take a long hard look.

59:14.618 --> 59:19.351
This is your last chance to save
your pitiful life.

59:19.923 --> 59:22.153
- Come on!
- All right, I've seen her.

59:22.325 --> 59:24.350
Where?
Where have you seen her?

59:24.360 --> 59:25.850
She's dead.

59:29.499 --> 59:30.864
Dead?

59:32.502 --> 59:34.094
Don't you lie to me.

59:34.103 --> 59:35.536
No!

59:35.804 --> 59:38.671
I wouldn't lie. I want to live!

59:38.776 --> 59:41.973
Don't you lie to me!

59:42.111 --> 59:44.705
I'm not. She's dead!
Dead!

59:44.882 --> 59:46.247
She's not dead!

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.188
For the bag. Leave it all.

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.387
Thank you, sir.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.135
Are you sure?

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.805
It is him. I knew it.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.517
Sir?

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:35.280
Captain Kane?

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:39.323
I'm Henry Telford.
Do you remember me?

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.487
Captain Kane?

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:47.695
I was a mate on the Tiercel
when you captained.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.569
My name's Telford.
Do you remember?

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:52.470
- It's not him.
- It is him! It's Kane.

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:55.798
He can lead us, believe me.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:58.610
Where to, Henry?
Another tavern? Look at him!

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:04.878
My friend here says you're the
greatest warrior he ever saw.

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:08.780
- I don't believe him.
- You shouldn't.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.092
I know what you can do, Captain.
I've seen it!

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.822
Those were distant times.

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:21.697
She's dead now.

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:25.768
And I have...

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:28.973
...forfeit my soul.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.086
- He's no use to us. Leave him!
- No!

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.651
Captain Kane, we need a leader.

01:02:44.659 --> 01:02:47.719
- We have to fight back!
- Then fight back!

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.326
She's lost.

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.130
And I lost her.

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:01.810
And l-- I have to pay.

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:05.507
Let them come and get me.

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:07.643
I care not.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.162
Mercy!

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.470
Mercy, please!

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:13.647
This is the fate of those
who defy Malachi.

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.269
Please have mercy!

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.947
There will be no mercy!

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:35.526
This man cannot save you!

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:37.795
He is nothing!

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:39.792
Crucify him!

01:05:40.504 --> 01:05:42.665
And burn the town to the ground!

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:55.361
No, no, no!

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:58.637
Solomon!

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:01.573
Solomon!

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.311
God help him!

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:13.653
Solomon! Solomon, please!

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.845
- Meredith.
- Can you hear me?

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.384
Meredith!

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.426
Meredith!

01:08:24.799 --> 01:08:27.768
God-- save me!

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:23.783
Captain Kane.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:38.634
...another 20 at Romney Marsh.
He's getting stronger all the time.

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:43.337
That's why we need Kane.

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:48.116
We need him
whatever his past sins were.

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:51.447
But one devil for another
seems like folly.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:57.760
...Earth, fire, stone, and water...

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.321
Keep your filthy pagan magic
away from me.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:04.493
It is my pagan magic
that has healed you.

01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:07.731
There's more power here
than your Christian God.

01:10:07.936 --> 01:10:10.268
You'd do well to remember that.

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:23.708
I have done what you asked.

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:26.716
His body is healed.

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.121
What do you see of our future?

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:34.997
Your champion will lead you
into blood and darkness.

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:36.624
Are you ready for that?

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:06.380
What are you doing?
You need to rest.

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.581
- I'm leaving.
- Why?

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:12.123
Because it's not over yet.
She's still alive.

01:12:12.827 --> 01:12:14.419
You're barely healed.

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:16.694
And we're too few to
fight Malachi's men.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.065
Just wait a little.

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:23.832
I do not ask you to come with me
nor do I want you to.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.638
Well, you may not want it but we will.

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:29.843
This lad has promised us you will
destroy this evil...

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:32.208
...and we're here to fight with you.

01:12:37.618 --> 01:12:39.518
Promised, have you?

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:44.617
That's what you want, isn't it?
To end this?

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:49.089
Then let us help you.

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:52.927
Malachi was a priest and a healer...

01:12:53.434 --> 01:12:57.029
...but he sold his soul to the Devil
for the power he now possesses.

01:12:58.107 --> 01:13:00.735
He enslaves our people
and corrupts the land.

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:03.644
And the masked rider...

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.381
...he's the iron fist that commands
his army and spreads the poison.

01:13:08.752 --> 01:13:11.220
He has no face beneath his mask.

01:13:11.486 --> 01:13:13.545
He can possess you with his touch.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:16.385
It's true, I've seen it.

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:21.623
If we kill him,
Malachi will be vulnerable.

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:23.788
Easier said than done, my friend.

01:13:23.798 --> 01:13:24.924
No.

01:13:25.666 --> 01:13:27.429
He will fall.

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.462
You know where this Malachi is?

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:30.699
That is no secret.

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:32.139
Axmouth Castle.

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:36.073
No-- No, that cannot be.

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:40.246
There is no doubt.
Do you know it?

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:43.483
My father was lord of Axmouth Castle.

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:45.410
I grew up there.

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.180
There's no lord there now.

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:53.457
I did not even know he'd died.

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:56.829
Now-- this must end.

01:13:57.732 --> 01:14:00.758
All of you... all of you,
gather your weapons!

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:03.068
- We're not ready.
- It's time to take the fight to him.

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:05.096
- We're not ready.
- Neither is he!

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.439
- We're too few.
- Oh, come on!

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:10.037
You have seen me taking
cities with fewer.

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:12.172
But how do we get through
the front gates?

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:16.310
You forget, I was born here.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:19.285
I have no intention of
going through the front gates.

01:15:49.012 --> 01:15:51.537
Good God. My home!

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.413
You lived here?

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:56.106
That explains a lot.

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.065
You!

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:19.902
Welcome home--

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:22.005
Solomon Kane.

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:24.002
Telford! Get your men inside!
We cannot win this!

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.564
Men!

01:17:28.576 --> 01:17:29.736
Follow me!

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:39.272
Meredith?

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:44.109
- Help us!
- Meredith?

01:18:44.452 --> 01:18:46.249
Is there a girl in there called Meredith?

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:47.881
- Please help us...
- Meredith?

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:05.598
You're free. All of you.
Get out.

01:19:10.278 --> 01:19:12.371
Let's get away from here.

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.070
Come on, old man, you're free.

01:19:38.508 --> 01:19:39.975
All right, I'll help you, then.

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:45.645
Let's see if I can
loosen these chains.

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:48.308
Even if you do, I'll stay.

01:19:48.684 --> 01:19:50.675
What are you talking about, man?
Why?

01:19:50.686 --> 01:19:53.018
Because this was my home.

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:01.056
Father?

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:05.926
Solomon?

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:19.939
I thought I had lost you forever.

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:22.844
You were still a boy when...

01:20:28.256 --> 01:20:32.659
You will never break them.
They were spun with dark magic...

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:35.022
...as much as with metal.

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:42.095
How will I free you?

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:44.401
You can't, Solomon, don't try now.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.171
My Father...

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:52.603
...I have carried such...

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.912
...such guilt for what I did.

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:58.485
I did not mean for Marcus to fall.

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:00.981
I did not mean for him to die.

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:04.553
He did not die, Solomon.

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:10.120
If he had, this nightmare
would never have begun.

01:21:10.364 --> 01:21:11.922
He did not...?

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.792
Thank God he is alive.

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:18.102
It was not through God's will
that he survived.

01:21:19.406 --> 01:21:20.862
Well, what do you mean?

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.343
Well...

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:27.104
...he was terribly injured
by the all but he didn't die.

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:29.636
But nor did he wake.

01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:32.847
No surgeons or priests could help, so...

01:21:36.692 --> 01:21:39.149
...I brought the sorcerer here.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.718
- You?
- Yeah.

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:43.530
You brought Malachi here?

01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:46.795
I offered him everything I had.

01:21:47.668 --> 01:21:51.001
Just to bring Marcus back to me.
Everything.

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:56.333
And he succeeded, Solomon.

01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:59.069
With his mirrors and magic...

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.982
...he reached into the darkness
and brought Marcus back. But...

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:05.846
...he was changed.

01:22:07.454 --> 01:22:11.413
And his face,
so damaged by the fall...

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.995
...he hid behind a mask...

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:17.926
...and obeyed only the will of the sorcerer.

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:21.865
No, he cannot be my brother.

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.600
That creature is your brother.

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.503
Or what remains.

01:22:26.742 --> 01:22:31.111
And now Marcus infects
those who follow him.

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:36.640
One thing you must do for me.

01:22:36.786 --> 01:22:39.220
Father, just ask and it shall be done.

01:22:49.966 --> 01:22:53.367
We both have our sins to answer for.

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:56.696
And I'm ready to answer for mine...

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.400
...now.

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:00.640
No.

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.266
You have to.

01:23:02.778 --> 01:23:05.611
Because I brought the sorcerer here.

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:09.745
And as long as I'm alive he will remain.

01:23:11.952 --> 01:23:14.284
He will never let me die.

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.278
Bring it here.

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.243
Kane!

01:23:45.586 --> 01:23:46.883
Through here!

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:48.543
Kane, for God's sake, help us!

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:50.387
Is this it?
Is this all you have left?

01:23:50.392 --> 01:23:53.452
Fletcher, McNess, Hawkstone, maybe.
The rest I don't know.

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:54.984
Just keep them back.

01:23:55.562 --> 01:23:56.881
You hold steady now.

01:23:56.897 --> 01:23:58.626
This is your folly.

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:02.027
Just a few more moments.

01:24:02.738 --> 01:24:05.332
I think I can stop this
with a single blow.

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:25.754
Malachi?

01:24:27.694 --> 01:24:29.719
Malachi!

01:24:30.498 --> 01:24:34.264
I'm here for you.
Isn't this what you want?

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:00.556
Come on.

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.129
Solomon!

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:38.893
Solomon, no, it's a trap!

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:49.134
Long is the road that the pilgrim walks
in the name of his devotion.

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:56.978
Yet longer still is the journey home
to the land of his fathers.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.819
I've been waiting for you.

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:11.656
You are unfit to sit upon
my father's hair.

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.361
Your father was a child.

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:16.667
A pathetic fool
who made a pact with the Devil.

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:20.740
He betrayed you.
Your soul is damned.

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:22.575
Get up!

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:27.378
Are you still the good, loyal son?

01:26:41.896 --> 01:26:43.158
Malachi?

01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:46.498
Malachi!

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:49.133
Malachi, you coward!

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.640
Meredith, are you all right?

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:56.703
You came for me.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:58.236
I swore I would.

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:00.603
Solomon, no, it's a trap!

01:27:00.616 --> 01:27:02.516
They only marked me so that
you would come.

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:04.650
No, stop!

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:06.973
The Devil wants you.

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:09.286
The Devil can take me soon enough.

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.932
Oh God, Solomon!

01:27:28.944 --> 01:27:31.640
Brother, listen to me.

01:27:32.446 --> 01:27:36.007
If you can hear me, Marcus,
you do not have to do this.

01:27:36.017 --> 01:27:36.881
No!

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.744
Listen to me!

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:52.563
Meredith, run!

01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:10.947
Where is your master?
Where is he?

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:14.445
Where are you, Malachi?
Hiding in the shadows?

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:18.324
Why should I hide from you?
I want you here.

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:21.552
Every step you took
led you to here.

01:28:21.662 --> 01:28:24.756
Every pain you suffered was
punishment for your sins.

01:28:24.965 --> 01:28:27.593
My master will have your soul!

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:32.035
See what the Devil
has sent to claim you.

01:28:32.374 --> 01:28:35.707
This beast will not fail to drag you
back to Hell.

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:38.643
Your soul is damned!

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.604
Oh, dear God!

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:46.219
Marcus...

01:28:47.988 --> 01:28:49.785
...our father is dead.

01:28:50.092 --> 01:28:52.219
You are lord here now!

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:55.090
Malachi has no control over you!

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:03.868
No!

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.423
Brother, stop! Brother!

01:29:41.842 --> 01:29:43.173
Solomon!

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:03.892
Rest in peace, brother.

01:30:05.834 --> 01:30:09.497
It's time. Only your
innocent blood will release him.

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:20.242
Now you are free!

01:30:42.704 --> 01:30:44.296
Get him!

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:54.136
My God.
Only you can help me now.

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:35.414
Stop!

01:31:35.922 --> 01:31:37.184
Let her go.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.819
You can have my soul.

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:45.557
Why would you risk everything,
even our soul...

01:31:47.734 --> 01:31:49.599
...to save her?

01:31:50.772 --> 01:31:52.364
I made a promise.

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:56.007
I must keep it.

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:57.935
Solomon.

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:12.179
Oh, thank God.

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:16.790
Oh, thank God.

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:21.318
It's gone.

01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:24.495
Your father told me...

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:28.224
...that if I saved you...

01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:31.268
...my soul will be redeemed.

01:33:32.973 --> 01:33:34.565
I have.

01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:38.002
And it is.

01:33:39.313 --> 01:33:42.373
And the Devil's claim on me
is no more.

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.724
The guards have fallen.

01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:23.021
Father...

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:27.458
...I have kept my promise and
Meredith is returned to her mother.

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:30.060
The demon is gone.

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:34.463
Banished to the shadows along
with the sorcerer who had cursed us all.

01:34:35.602 --> 01:34:38.833
But evil is not so easily defeated...

01:34:38.974 --> 01:34:41.670
...and I know I will have to fight again.

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:45.110
I am a very different man now.

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:47.709
through all of my travels,

01:34:47.714 --> 01:34:50.979
all the things I've seen and all I've done...

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:53.445
...I have found my purpose.

01:34:54.656 --> 01:34:58.285
There was a time when the world was
plunging into darkness.

01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:03.261
A time of witchcraft and sorcery,
when no-one stood against evil.

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:05.595
That time...

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:08.426
...is over.
