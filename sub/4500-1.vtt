01:30.376 --> 01:31.626
In order to show you how

01:31.709 --> 01:34.209
a big symphony
orchestra is put together,

01:34.292 --> 01:37.376
Benjamin Britten
has written a big piece of music,

01:37.459 --> 01:39.209
which is made up
of smaller pieces

01:39.292 --> 01:42.292
that show you all
the separate parts of the orchestra.

01:42.376 --> 01:45.167
These smaller pieces
are called variations,

01:45.251 --> 01:48.751
which means different ways
of playing the same tune.

01:48.876 --> 01:52.084
First of all,
he lets us hear the tune or the theme,

01:52.167 --> 01:53.292
which is a beautiful melody

01:53.376 --> 01:56.751
by the much older
British composer Henry Purcell.

01:56.834 --> 02:01.292
Here is Purcell's theme
played by the whole orchestra together.

02:30.542 --> 02:34.501
Now, Mr. Britten lets you hear the four
different families of the orchestra

02:34.584 --> 02:37.542
playing the same Purcell theme
in different ways.

02:37.626 --> 02:39.417
First, we hear
the woodwind family.

02:39.501 --> 02:43.167
The flutes, the oboes,
the clarinets and the bassoons.

03:05.459 --> 03:07.376
Here comes the brass family.

03:07.459 --> 03:10.751
The trumpets, the horns,
the trombones and the tubas.

03:16.876 --> 03:18.251
One to four.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.667
Now, Mr. Britten arranges the Purcell theme
for the string family.

03:33.751 --> 03:34.792
I'm sick of this rain.

03:34.876 --> 03:39.292
The violins, the violas, the
cellos and the double basses.

03:39.376 --> 03:41.751
And of course, the harp.

04:02.751 --> 04:05.126
And finally
the percussion family,

04:05.209 --> 04:08.501
all those drums and gongs
and things you hit.

04:12.209 --> 04:14.667
After this, you will
hear the theme by Purcell

04:14.751 --> 04:18.666
played once more in its original
form by all four families together.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.041
That is, the whole orchestra.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.042
This is
the island of New Penzance.

04:48.417 --> 04:50.292
16 miles long.

04:51.459 --> 04:54.459
Forested with
old-growth pine and maple.

04:55.626 --> 04:58.209
Criss-crossed by
shallow tidal creeks.

04:59.334 --> 05:01.709
Chickchaw territory.

05:02.251 --> 05:03.292
There are no
paved roads, but...

05:04.626 --> 05:06.584
Here comes Jed with the mail.

05:06.667 --> 05:10.709
But instead many miles of intersecting
footpaths and dirt trails,

05:10.792 --> 05:13.834
and a ferry that
runs twice daily from Stone Cove.

05:14.792 --> 05:18.167
The year is 1965.

05:19.209 --> 05:22.209
We are on the far edge
of Black Beacon Sound,

05:22.292 --> 05:24.959
famous for the ferocious
and well-documented storm,

05:25.042 --> 05:28.292
which will strike from the
east on the 5th of September.

05:29.042 --> 05:31.542
In three days' time.

05:47.751 --> 05:48.959
Morning, Gadge.

05:49.042 --> 05:50.334
Morning, sir.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.334
Deluca, latrine inspection.

06:10.042 --> 06:11.376
Good.

06:13.501 --> 06:15.709
Roosevelt,
how's that lanyard coming?

06:16.709 --> 06:17.876
Horrible.

06:21.959 --> 06:23.709
Skotak,
what's all this lumber for?

06:23.792 --> 06:25.126
We're building a tree house.

06:25.209 --> 06:26.542
- Where?
- Right here.

06:29.251 --> 06:32.501
That's not a safe altitude.
Why is it up so high?

06:32.584 --> 06:34.667
If someone falls from there,
that's a guaranteed death.

06:34.751 --> 06:35.876
Well, where would
you have built it?

06:36.626 --> 06:38.126
Lower.

06:44.126 --> 06:45.792
Nickleby? What are you doing?

06:45.876 --> 06:47.501
Pest control.
Burning some ants.

06:47.584 --> 06:49.251
Spot check.

06:51.292 --> 06:53.001
Your socks are down,
your shirt tails are untucked,

06:53.084 --> 06:54.501
your trousers are
not properly pressed.

06:54.584 --> 06:57.042
You are reported for
a uniform violation.

07:00.084 --> 07:01.292
How many rockets
you up to, Panagle?

07:01.376 --> 07:02.417
Sixteen and a half, sir.

07:02.501 --> 07:03.792
Is that enough
for the Hullabaloo?

07:03.876 --> 07:06.459
Izod, go fetch another pint of
gunpowder from the armory shed.

07:06.542 --> 07:07.917
Redford! Halt! I saw that!

07:09.542 --> 07:11.042
- How fast were you just going?
- Safety test, sir.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.167
Come again?

07:12.251 --> 07:13.501
The vehicle
appears to be in good working order,

07:13.584 --> 07:14.667
I'm just checking if...

07:14.751 --> 07:16.167
Reckless cycling.
Second warning.

07:16.251 --> 07:18.042
Next time,
I take away the keys.

07:20.084 --> 07:21.751
Morning, Chef.

07:32.084 --> 07:32.959
Clear!

07:44.917 --> 07:47.042
Who's missing?

07:47.126 --> 07:49.084
- Who's missing?
- Shakusky.

07:49.167 --> 07:52.292
- Shakusky.
- Shakusky.

07:52.376 --> 07:53.959
Shakusky! Breakfast!

08:00.501 --> 08:02.584
Shakusky, you in there?

08:03.959 --> 08:05.417
Sam?

08:08.667 --> 08:10.084
It's zipped from the inside.

08:35.876 --> 08:38.208
Jiminy Cricket,
he flew the coop.

08:57.751 --> 08:59.626
Hello, this is
Captain Sharp, over.

08:59.709 --> 09:03.209
Captain Sharp, this is Randall
Ward over at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.334
Morning, Randy.
What can I do for you? Over.

09:05.417 --> 09:10.001
I'm not sure exactly.
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. Over.

09:11.709 --> 09:13.126
What does that mean? Over.

09:13.209 --> 09:14.834
One of my boys
seems to have stolen

09:14.917 --> 09:16.834
a miniature canoe and
some fishing tackle,

09:16.917 --> 09:19.876
10 pounds of sundries,
two bedrolls, plus an air rifle.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.001
And disappeared. Over.

09:22.084 --> 09:23.459
Any idea why? Over.

09:23.542 --> 09:26.709
No. He left me
a letter of resignation. Over.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.001
Dear Scout Master Ward,

09:28.084 --> 09:30.792
I am very sad to inform you
I can no longer be involved

09:30.876 --> 09:32.709
with the Khaki
Scouts of North America.

09:32.792 --> 09:35.001
The rest of the troop
will probably be glad to hear this.

09:35.084 --> 09:36.126
It is not your fault.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.792
Best wishes, Sam Shakusky.

09:39.584 --> 09:42.959
Well, I guess we better
notify his folks. Over.

09:43.042 --> 09:45.292
Okay. Over and out.

10:00.584 --> 10:01.626
Hello, Diane.

10:01.709 --> 10:04.376
Becky, I have your
person-to-person from Chesterfield

10:04.459 --> 10:05.626
Hold the line, please.

10:07.459 --> 10:08.501
Hello?

10:08.584 --> 10:10.334
Hello, sir.
This is Captain Sharp.

10:10.417 --> 10:13.751
Yes, sir. I received your
message. Thank you very much.

10:13.834 --> 10:17.292
In fact, we've come to
a decision, as a family,

10:17.376 --> 10:21.542
because this is only the most recent
incident involving Sam's troubles,

10:21.626 --> 10:24.751
and it's just not
fair to the others, so, unfortunately,

10:24.834 --> 10:28.209
we can't invite him
back at this time.

10:30.626 --> 10:34.376
There's no cause
for alarm, sir. We'll find him.

10:34.459 --> 10:37.167
We're simply notifying you
as a matter of protocol and so on.

10:37.501 --> 10:40.542
I understand that. I'm notifying
you of the situation on my end.

10:41.584 --> 10:44.584
I'm confused by
that statement. You can't invite him back?

10:45.167 --> 10:48.542
I'm afraid not.
He's a good boy. He's got a good heart.

10:48.626 --> 10:51.334
But it's just not fair
to the others, you see?

10:52.209 --> 10:54.292
He's emotionally disturbed.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.667
Am I speaking
with Sam's father?

11:01.542 --> 11:03.417
No, sir.

11:03.501 --> 11:05.709
Sam's parents passed away
a number of years ago.

11:05.792 --> 11:08.834
We're Mr. and
Mrs. Billingsley. We're foster parents.

11:09.417 --> 11:12.042
Sam's been with
us since last June.

11:12.126 --> 11:14.959
Excuse me, sir.
This is Scout Master Ward speaking.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.792
Are you implying
that Sam is an orphan?

11:17.376 --> 11:19.459
Well, it's a known fact.
Of course he is.

11:19.917 --> 11:21.667
Well, why the hell
doesn't it say so in the register?

11:21.751 --> 11:22.834
Excuse my language.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.167
I don't know. What register?

11:27.834 --> 11:29.876
We sent him a letter.
It should reach you presently.

11:31.292 --> 11:34.042
Mr. Billingsley,
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.417
We are notifying you
as a matter of protocol.

11:36.501 --> 11:39.709
You say you can't invite him back?
You say that he's an orphan?

11:40.376 --> 11:42.042
I don't understand
how that works.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.667
What am I supposed
to do with him?

11:45.626 --> 11:48.376
That's up to social services.
They'll be in touch with you.

11:48.459 --> 11:51.251
They'll look after Sam.
Good luck to you.

11:59.667 --> 12:00.792
You have your orders.

12:00.876 --> 12:02.834
Use the orienteering
and path-finding skills

12:02.917 --> 12:04.501
that you've been
practicing all summer.

12:04.584 --> 12:07.459
Let's find our man,
bring him safely back to camp.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.751
Remember, this isn't
just a search party,

12:09.834 --> 12:11.959
it's a chance to do
some first class Scouting.

12:12.042 --> 12:14.209
Any questions?

12:14.292 --> 12:15.417
Lazy-Eye?

12:15.501 --> 12:17.084
What's your real job, sir?

12:17.167 --> 12:18.959
- I'm a math teacher. Why?
- What grade?

12:19.042 --> 12:20.751
- Eighth.
- You need a PhD for that?

12:20.834 --> 12:22.167
Lazy-Eye, no,
but you know what,

12:22.251 --> 12:24.792
we're actually in the middle of something
here, in case you didn't notice.

12:24.876 --> 12:27.001
One of our Scouts is missing
and that's a crisis.

12:27.084 --> 12:28.126
Anybody else? Redford?

12:28.251 --> 12:29.292
What if he resists?

12:29.376 --> 12:30.459
- Who?
- Shakusky.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.584
Are we allowed to
use force on him?

12:31.667 --> 12:35.834
No, you're not.
This is a non-violent, rescue operation.

12:35.917 --> 12:39.292
Your mission is to find him,
not to hurt him under any circumstances.

12:39.376 --> 12:41.251
Am I making myself understood?

12:41.334 --> 12:43.126
- Yes.
- Good.

12:44.667 --> 12:47.292
I'm going to change my answer,
in fact, this is my real job.

12:47.376 --> 12:50.959
Scout Master Troop 55.
I'm a math teacher on the side.

12:52.042 --> 12:53.792
Be leery out there. Okay?

12:53.876 --> 12:55.292
Now let's get started.
Who's got Snoopy?

12:55.376 --> 12:56.709
Right here.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.126
Give him the scent.

13:02.917 --> 13:04.959
I heard he ran away
because his family died.

13:05.334 --> 13:07.334
I heard he
never had any family in the first place.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.751
That's probably why he's crazy.

13:08.834 --> 13:09.959
I'll tell you one thing,

13:10.042 --> 13:12.792
if we find him, I'm not going to be the
one who forgot to bring a weapon.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.834
Me, neither.

14:03.167 --> 14:05.959
Camp Ivanhoe, that's all the way
across the other side of the island.

14:06.042 --> 14:07.292
You really think
a 12-year-old boy

14:07.376 --> 14:09.334
could row this far
in a miniature canoe?

14:09.417 --> 14:10.459
Most likely not.

14:10.542 --> 14:12.001
It is possible, Counselor.

14:12.084 --> 14:14.292
I disagree, Counselor.
It would take him three days, at least.

14:14.376 --> 14:15.834
I don't think so.
Two days, maximum.

14:15.917 --> 14:18.167
- Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
- Be that as it may,

14:18.251 --> 14:20.209
- will you let me know if you see anything unusual?
- Yup.

15:29.251 --> 15:32.126
Scout Master's log,
September 2nd.

15:32.209 --> 15:34.626
First day of search
party for Sam Shakusky

15:35.001 --> 15:36.292
Morale is extremely low,

15:36.376 --> 15:37.417
in part, I suppose,

15:37.501 --> 15:39.792
because Sam is
the least popular Scout in the troop.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.251
By a significant margin.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.626
I'm confused and I'm worried.

15:48.209 --> 15:50.626
Please let us
find him tomorrow.

15:50.709 --> 15:54.042
Please don't let
him fall off a cliff,

15:54.126 --> 15:56.334
or drown in the goddamn
lake or something.

15:56.417 --> 15:58.001
A terrible day at Camp Ivanhoe.

16:01.209 --> 16:02.876
Let's hope tomorrow's better.

17:29.876 --> 17:32.126
One Year earlier

19:01.251 --> 19:02.459
What kind of bird are you?

19:03.459 --> 19:05.709
I'm a sparrow, she's a dove...

19:05.792 --> 19:09.959
No. I said,
what kind of bird are you?

19:13.167 --> 19:14.417
I'm a raven.

19:15.792 --> 19:16.959
Boys aren't allowed in here.

19:18.542 --> 19:19.709
I'll be leaving soon.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.042
What happened to your hand?

19:26.126 --> 19:27.834
I got hit in the mirror.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.667
Really, how did that happen?

19:30.959 --> 19:32.876
I lost my temper at myself.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.459
What's your name?

19:37.542 --> 19:38.792
Sam. What's yours?

19:39.251 --> 19:40.626
I'm Suzy.

19:43.292 --> 19:44.709
It's not polite to stare.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.417
- Birds, ready?
- Who are you?

19:47.501 --> 19:49.042
Where did you come from?
Go back to your seat.

19:55.209 --> 19:56.917
He likes you.

20:30.376 --> 20:31.542
Were you followed?

20:34.042 --> 20:35.542
- I doubt it.
- Good.

20:38.084 --> 20:39.334
Is that a cat in there?

20:47.626 --> 20:49.834
Can you read a map?

20:50.209 --> 20:52.417
I do cartography.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.626
I feel we should
go halfway today, and halfway tomorrow

20:54.709 --> 20:56.126
since you're a less
experienced hiker,

20:56.209 --> 20:58.251
and you're wearing
Sunday school shoes.

20:58.334 --> 20:59.376
They're not really
Sunday school shoes.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.501
Here.

21:00.584 --> 21:01.626
Oh, thank you.

21:04.209 --> 21:05.667
Here's where we are right now.

21:05.751 --> 21:07.876
I'd like to pitch
camp here by 1600,

21:07.959 --> 21:09.792
which means 4:00.
How does that sound?

21:09.876 --> 21:11.792
- Fine.
- You want some beef jerky?

21:11.876 --> 21:13.292
- Okay.
- Let's go.

21:26.126 --> 21:27.501
Are you thirsty?

21:27.584 --> 21:28.959
No, thank you.

21:29.042 --> 21:31.126
Well, if your throat
gets parched,

21:31.209 --> 21:33.001
stick a pebble in your
mouth and suck on it.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.959
You can quench your thirst
with the spit, supposedly.

21:37.209 --> 21:40.417
Sometimes I stick leaves on my
hair. It helps cool your head down.

21:40.501 --> 21:41.542
That's a good idea.

21:41.626 --> 21:43.959
It might also help if
you didn't wear a fur hat.

21:44.042 --> 21:46.001
Yeah. True.

21:47.292 --> 21:50.584
You can go ahead. Be careful.

22:01.709 --> 22:03.459
Here's a trick,
throw pine needles in the air

22:03.542 --> 22:05.459
and you can see
which direction the wind is blowing.

22:09.751 --> 22:11.084
Which Way?

22:13.876 --> 22:15.001
I guess it
doesn't really matter,

22:15.084 --> 22:16.376
just as long as we
cover our tracks.

22:27.876 --> 22:29.876
You smell like perfume.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.376
Oh, it's my mother's.

22:44.292 --> 22:46.167
I brought water, too.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.167
- You wait here.
- Okay.

22:52.417 --> 22:53.792
Be right back.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.167
Watch your head!

23:08.251 --> 23:09.626
Where the hell is it?

23:16.709 --> 23:18.001
Found it!

23:28.792 --> 23:29.917
It's ready.

23:30.876 --> 23:33.376
He knows someone's
watching him.

23:33.459 --> 23:37.042
I agree. Wait.
Why do you say that?

23:38.417 --> 23:41.251
I don't know,
I just think he can feel us.

23:46.667 --> 23:48.209
Follow me.

24:15.667 --> 24:17.292
How strong of
a swimmer are you?

24:17.376 --> 24:20.126
Pretty good. I broke our school
record for the backstroke.

24:20.209 --> 24:23.792
Okay. Well, I'm not that strong of a
swimmer, so I wear a life preserver.

24:29.709 --> 24:30.834
Watch out for turtles.

24:30.917 --> 24:33.417
They'll bite you
if you put your fingers down their mouths.

24:33.501 --> 24:35.084
Okay.

24:35.167 --> 24:36.876
Let me see if I
can catch this one.

24:39.709 --> 24:41.209
Feel something.

24:47.209 --> 24:48.501
Somebody wrote on him.

24:49.626 --> 24:51.542
The stick's moving.

24:51.626 --> 24:52.792
You got one!

24:54.042 --> 24:56.792
Fish on hook!
Reel him in, slowly.

25:10.501 --> 25:13.501
Very good.
You know a lot about camping, don't you?

25:14.334 --> 25:18.459
I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained
for. Well, anyway, I used to be.

25:19.501 --> 25:22.959
Maybe we can feed your cat
the guts and eyeballs.

25:23.042 --> 25:24.709
Oh, that's okay.
He only eats kitten food.

25:26.084 --> 25:27.126
Oh.

25:27.834 --> 25:30.542
What else did you bring?
Maybe we can make an inventory.

25:31.376 --> 25:32.501
Okay.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.084
Go ahead.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.126
This is my record player.
It works with batteries.

25:47.209 --> 25:49.584
Well, actually,
it belongs to my little brother, Lionel.

25:49.667 --> 25:51.126
- I left him a note.
- Okay.

25:51.209 --> 25:53.084
- Do you like music?
- Yeah.

25:54.167 --> 25:56.167
This is my
favorite record album.

25:56.251 --> 25:58.251
My godmother gave it
to me for my birthday.

25:58.334 --> 26:00.084
She lives in France.

26:02.126 --> 26:05.501
These are my books.
I like stories with magic powers in them.

26:05.584 --> 26:08.042
Either in kingdoms on Earth
or on foreign planets.

26:08.126 --> 26:11.251
Usually, I prefer
a girl hero, but not always.

26:11.334 --> 26:13.459
I couldn't bring them all
because it got too heavy.

26:13.542 --> 26:14.667
You can borrow any you want.

26:14.751 --> 26:15.792
Thank you.

26:15.876 --> 26:20.751
I also brought
my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed,

26:20.834 --> 26:25.376
some rubber bands,
extra batteries, my toothbrush,

26:25.459 --> 26:26.542
and my binoculars, as you know.

26:26.626 --> 26:27.667
Yeah.

26:27.751 --> 26:29.959
I forgot my comb.
But I'll use my fingers.

26:38.792 --> 26:42.667
Wait, these are all
library books.

26:42.751 --> 26:46.667
In my school, you're only
allowed to check out one at a time.

26:47.084 --> 26:49.959
Some of these are
going to be overdue.

26:51.876 --> 26:53.084
Do you steal?

26:55.667 --> 26:57.376
Why? You're not poor.

26:58.542 --> 27:02.251
I might turn some of them back in one day.
I haven't decided yet.

27:02.334 --> 27:05.917
I know it's bad. I think I just took
them to have a secret to keep.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.667
Anyway, for some reason,

27:07.751 --> 27:09.417
it makes me feel in
a better mood sometimes.

27:10.917 --> 27:12.626
Are you depressed?

27:14.376 --> 27:15.626
How come?

27:15.709 --> 27:18.001
Well, I can show you
an example, if you'd like,

27:19.501 --> 27:21.751
but it doesn't make
me feel very good.

27:21.834 --> 27:26.167
Anyway, I found this
on top of our refrigerator.

27:27.542 --> 27:28.584
Does that mean you?

27:29.751 --> 27:31.126
I think so.

27:35.667 --> 27:36.709
Are you laughing?

27:40.084 --> 27:41.126
It's not funny.

27:44.876 --> 27:47.417
You really know
how to make friends.

28:06.584 --> 28:07.626
I'm sorry.

28:08.917 --> 28:10.792
Oh. It's okay.

28:11.126 --> 28:12.792
I'm on your side.

28:14.251 --> 28:15.584
I know.

28:20.667 --> 28:22.042
Thank you.

28:26.167 --> 28:28.584
Which one's the best?

28:28.667 --> 28:32.834
"His eyes downcast, his kingdom in
ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw"

28:32.917 --> 28:34.876
"through the rippling surface
of the cool shallows"

28:34.959 --> 28:36.584
"and down to its stone floor."

28:36.667 --> 28:39.751
"My people once were led
by a great and noble beast"

28:39.834 --> 28:43.042
"and I no longer
see his face in this reflection.'"

28:57.751 --> 29:01.001
"Meanwhile,
on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested."

29:01.084 --> 29:03.042
"There would be
another time for war."

29:05.834 --> 29:08.542
Suzy! Dinner! I'm not
going to say it again.

29:10.876 --> 29:12.334
Where's your sister?

29:12.417 --> 29:16.751
I don't know, but she borrowed my record
player for 10 days without asking.

29:16.834 --> 29:19.501
What does that mean?

29:19.584 --> 29:22.001
Dear Lionel, I need
to use your record player.

29:22.084 --> 29:25.626
I will give it back in 10 days or less.
Do not tell Mom. Or Dad.

29:25.709 --> 29:28.917
I will replace the batteries when I
return. Signed, Suzy Bishop.

29:31.876 --> 29:33.459
Walt! Where the hell are you?

29:33.542 --> 29:34.667
Right here!

29:34.751 --> 29:36.667
Why are you cursing at me?

29:36.751 --> 29:39.417
Does it concern you that
your daughter's just run away from home?

29:42.584 --> 29:43.876
That's a loaded question.

29:44.376 --> 29:45.709
Come down and read this.

29:46.376 --> 29:49.001
Scout Master Ward
confirms they've had no luck.

29:49.084 --> 29:50.126
They're going home for...

29:53.251 --> 29:54.292
Who's there?

29:59.334 --> 30:02.084
Good evening.
Sorry to startle you.

30:02.167 --> 30:04.709
What are you doing here?
Nobody called the police.

30:04.792 --> 30:07.084
I know. I know.

30:07.167 --> 30:09.584
The search party's
not over yet. In other words...

30:09.667 --> 30:11.834
Suzy's missing, too!
Go find her.

30:14.834 --> 30:17.084
The tropical cyclone,
which originated last week

30:17.167 --> 30:20.001
off the coast of
British Honduras, has intensified rapidly

30:20.084 --> 30:22.667
and is now designated
Hurricane Mabeline.

30:22.751 --> 30:24.459
Stay tuned for
further information

30:29.834 --> 30:34.376
How can we help her?
She's got so many problems.

30:35.084 --> 30:36.876
It's getting worse.

30:38.542 --> 30:40.167
Whose fault is it?

30:40.251 --> 30:41.376
I don't know.

30:42.126 --> 30:44.876
But just for the record
95% of all runaways

30:44.959 --> 30:46.834
return home within
the first six hours.

30:47.417 --> 30:50.417
That doesn't do you
any good right now. It's just a statistic.

30:50.834 --> 30:53.292
But in all likelihood,
Suzy's probably hiding in the closet

30:53.376 --> 30:55.667
at her best friend's house
playing Chinese checkers

30:55.751 --> 30:58.084
at this very moment,
as we speak.

30:58.167 --> 31:00.376
She doesn't have any friends.

31:01.876 --> 31:03.251
How's Laura?

31:06.459 --> 31:07.834
"How's Laura?"

31:07.917 --> 31:09.459
Mrs. Bishop, I mean.

31:09.542 --> 31:12.126
I don't understand.

31:12.209 --> 31:13.584
Is she upset?

31:28.001 --> 31:29.376
There's a porcupine.

31:38.876 --> 31:43.459
She has a pen pal! It's very intimate.
They planned this together.

31:44.501 --> 31:47.751
Sam Shakusky.
That's my escaped Khaki Scout.

31:47.834 --> 31:48.917
His family died.

31:49.001 --> 31:51.001
Holy Christ,
what am I looking at?

31:51.084 --> 31:54.417
He does watercolors.
Mostly landscapes, but a few nudes.

31:54.501 --> 31:55.542
She sit for this?

31:55.626 --> 31:56.667
What's he say?

31:59.251 --> 32:01.459
Dear Suzy,
you have a superb voice.

32:01.542 --> 32:03.834
You were my favorite animal
in the program, by far.

32:03.917 --> 32:05.251
Please find enclosed...

32:05.334 --> 32:07.001
Dear Sam, thank you very much.

32:07.084 --> 32:09.834
I got replaced as the raven
because I yelled at Mrs. Lynn.

32:09.917 --> 32:11.667
After that,
I was only a blue jay, but...

32:11.751 --> 32:14.584
Dear Suzy, I'm sorry
that your brothers are so selfish.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.042
Maybe they will grow out of it.

32:16.126 --> 32:18.626
Sometimes people do things
without knowing the reasons for...

32:18.709 --> 32:20.459
Dear Sam, you are
an excellent painter,

32:20.542 --> 32:22.251
especially trees
and telephone poles.

32:22.334 --> 32:25.417
Is the girl in the water supposed to be
me? My favorite color is...

32:25.501 --> 32:29.209
Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a
fire while I was sleepwalking.

32:29.292 --> 32:32.417
I have no memory of this,
but my foster parents think I am lying.

32:32.501 --> 32:33.542
Unfortunately, it is...

32:33.626 --> 32:35.626
Dear Sam, I am in trouble again

32:35.709 --> 32:37.209
because I threw a rock
through the window.

32:37.292 --> 32:39.709
My mother still has
glass in her hair. Also...

32:39.792 --> 32:42.292
Dear Suzy, I have been
trying very hard to make friends,

32:42.376 --> 32:44.834
but I feel people do
not like my personality.

32:44.917 --> 32:46.751
In fact, I can understand
why they might not...

32:46.834 --> 32:48.751
Dear Sam,
now I am getting suspended

32:48.834 --> 32:50.334
because I got in
a fight with Molly.

32:50.417 --> 32:53.417
She says I go berserk.
Our principal is against me. Why do some...

32:53.501 --> 32:55.834
Dear Suzy, I know your parents
hurt' your feelings,

32:55.917 --> 32:58.917
but they still love you.
That is more important. If they...

32:59.001 --> 33:00.667
Dear Sam, I do think you should

33:00.751 --> 33:01.917
think of their faces every day,

33:02.001 --> 33:03.459
even if it makes you sad.

33:03.542 --> 33:05.001
It is too bad they
did not leave you

33:05.084 --> 33:07.001
more pictures of themselves.
Can you...

33:07.084 --> 33:09.001
Dear Suzy, here is my plan.

33:09.084 --> 33:11.084
Dear Sam, my answer is yes.

33:11.167 --> 33:12.584
Dear Suzy, when?

33:12.667 --> 33:14.251
Dear Sam, where?

33:14.334 --> 33:17.834
Dear Suzy,
walk 400 yards due north from your house

33:17.917 --> 33:20.459
to the dirt path
which has not got any name on it.

33:20.542 --> 33:24.417
Turn right and follow to the
end. I will meet you in the meadow.

33:32.209 --> 33:34.501
Gee whiz, what do you
suppose happened to him?

33:34.584 --> 33:38.001
I'm not sure.
I think he went searching in the dark.

33:38.084 --> 33:41.042
She stole the batteries
out of my flashlight.

33:41.126 --> 33:43.667
Stole the batteries
out of the flashlight...

33:45.834 --> 33:47.084
I think he's onto us.

33:47.167 --> 33:48.376
Of course he is.

33:48.459 --> 33:48.959
Of course he is?

33:49.709 --> 33:50.792
Of course he is.

33:52.584 --> 33:54.834
Then why aren't we
worried about that?

33:54.917 --> 33:56.542
I am.

33:56.626 --> 33:58.251
Well, I didn't know.

33:58.334 --> 34:01.709
Or, anyway,
I thought maybe I was wrong.

34:01.792 --> 34:02.834
Did you hit him?

34:02.917 --> 34:04.042
No. He fell in a ditch.

34:04.126 --> 34:08.751
Hey! Cat food!
I think it's a clue.

34:13.208 --> 34:14.583
That's her.

34:16.251 --> 34:17.917
Where's he going?

34:18.708 --> 34:20.167
I don't know.

34:21.708 --> 34:23.376
All right,
we know they're together.

34:23.458 --> 34:25.667
We know they're within
a certain radius of this spot.

34:25.751 --> 34:28.001
I'm declaring a case
with the county right now.

34:28.083 --> 34:31.583
Until help arrives, I'm deputizing
the little guy, the skinny one,

34:31.667 --> 34:33.083
and the boy with
the patch on his eye

34:33.167 --> 34:34.501
to come with me in
the station wagon.

34:34.583 --> 34:37.667
Randy, you drop in and head up
river with the rest of your troops,

34:37.751 --> 34:39.001
split up on foot.

34:39.083 --> 34:41.167
Becky, call Jed,
tell him to circle over

34:41.251 --> 34:43.708
this end of the island
and fly low.

34:56.167 --> 34:57.251
Is it them?

34:57.334 --> 34:58.376
Yeah, yeah.

34:59.542 --> 35:00.834
They found the campfire.

35:00.917 --> 35:05.751
Rats! I should have put
more pine needles on it. Let's go.

35:12.084 --> 35:13.334
Be careful.

35:44.459 --> 35:46.084
What do you creeps want?

35:46.876 --> 35:48.292
We're looking for you.

35:49.251 --> 35:50.376
Why?

35:50.959 --> 35:52.334
Well, because
you're a fugitive.

35:52.417 --> 35:54.667
No, I'm not.
I quit the Khaki Scouts.

35:54.751 --> 35:57.167
Well, it doesn't matter
anyway. You don't have that authority.

35:57.251 --> 35:58.542
We've been deputized.

35:58.626 --> 36:01.876
Now, you're going to come
along peacefully or not?

36:05.042 --> 36:06.334
Listen to some reason.

36:06.417 --> 36:08.501
I don't like you.
You don't like me.

36:08.584 --> 36:11.292
So, why don't you
just let us disappear?

36:12.251 --> 36:15.167
Well, it's tempting,
but we can't allow it.

36:16.292 --> 36:17.584
You know,
you shouldn't be friends with him.

36:18.417 --> 36:19.459
Why not?

36:20.167 --> 36:21.334
Because he's crazy.

36:22.584 --> 36:24.251
Maybe you just don't know him.

36:25.626 --> 36:27.501
Actually, we know him
a lot better than you.

36:27.584 --> 36:29.501
He's emotionally disturbed
because his family died.

36:29.584 --> 36:31.292
Nickleby, tie him up.

36:34.792 --> 36:40.209
Do not cross this stick.

36:48.042 --> 36:49.542
You're doomed, Shakusky.

37:26.334 --> 37:28.667
Molly's right, I do go berserk.

37:31.001 --> 37:32.626
It was him or us.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.334
Oh, no.

37:43.167 --> 37:45.334
She stabbed
Redford in the back with lefty scissors.

37:45.417 --> 37:47.084
Repeat that, please? Over.

37:47.167 --> 37:50.334
Puncture wound, lower lumbar.
Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit.

37:50.751 --> 37:51.959
You're going to be okay.

37:52.042 --> 37:55.001
Thank goodness she
missed the artery. Here, bite on this.

37:55.084 --> 37:56.917
I tried to chop him,
but he dodged my tomahawk.

37:57.001 --> 37:58.501
He's got
excellent marksmanship.

37:58.584 --> 37:59.792
Shot Deluca in both arms.

37:59.876 --> 38:02.167
I guess we're going to miss
the Hullabaloo after all.

38:02.251 --> 38:03.584
Where's Snoopy?

38:04.876 --> 38:06.876
Those sons of bitches.

38:06.959 --> 38:09.542
They got him right
through the neck.

38:11.542 --> 38:13.209
Was he a good dog?

38:14.709 --> 38:18.917
Who's to say.
But he didn't deserve to die.

38:35.042 --> 38:36.167
What happened? Who is that?

38:36.251 --> 38:37.334
Clear the dock, Edgar!

38:37.417 --> 38:39.001
- Why is he bleeding?
- Is Suzy with you?

38:39.084 --> 38:40.792
No, she's in
the woods with Shakusky.

38:40.876 --> 38:41.917
Where am I going?

38:42.001 --> 38:44.917
The infirmary at Fort Lebanon.
We'll be right behind you. You got it?

38:45.001 --> 38:46.126
Yup.

38:46.209 --> 38:47.501
Warm up the motor,
I'll be right back.

38:47.584 --> 38:48.876
Hold it right there!

38:49.876 --> 38:51.042
You're not leaving this island.

38:51.126 --> 38:54.001
Our daughter has been
abducted by one of these beige lunatics.

38:54.084 --> 38:56.459
Walt, it's very clear.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.501
The two of them
conspired in this together.

38:58.584 --> 38:59.917
Don't worry,
Mr. Bishop. She'll be safe.

39:00.001 --> 39:01.292
Sam's got excellent
wilderness skills.

39:02.417 --> 39:04.417
Why can't you
control your Scouts?

39:06.292 --> 39:07.542
Well, I'm trying.

39:10.542 --> 39:11.667
Hey.

39:11.751 --> 39:12.834
Stop it! Stop it!

39:12.917 --> 39:14.501
- Stop it!
- Stop it.

39:14.584 --> 39:19.251
I do blame him.
But I also blame myself and both of you.

39:19.334 --> 39:23.834
With all due respect,
you can't let your children stab people.

39:23.917 --> 39:25.459
What are you talking about?

39:25.542 --> 39:27.167
She's violent,
Mrs. Bishop, it's assault.

39:30.834 --> 39:32.376
- Are you a lawyer?
- No, I'm not a lawyer.

39:32.459 --> 39:33.584
Well, we are!

39:33.667 --> 39:34.751
Take your hands off my wife!

39:34.834 --> 39:35.584
Take them off!

39:36.626 --> 39:40.417
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Captain Sharp!

39:44.501 --> 39:46.376
As some of you know,
I taught Sam

39:46.459 --> 39:48.751
for the cartography
accomplishment button.

39:48.834 --> 39:51.167
He's a smart boy
and he expressed a keen interest

39:51.251 --> 39:53.792
in the history of the island's
indigenous peoples.

39:54.334 --> 39:57.334
In particular,
I recall his fascination with the idea

39:57.417 --> 40:01.709
of retracing the original path of the
old Chickchaw harvest migration.

40:05.917 --> 40:09.917
What I'm getting at is this.
I think I know where they're going.

40:16.251 --> 40:17.876
Onto the birdhouse,

40:17.959 --> 40:20.042
where every kind
of bird imaginable

40:20.126 --> 40:22.209
is whirling
and wheeling around.

40:28.209 --> 40:30.709
This is our land!

40:30.792 --> 40:32.417
Yes, it is!

40:36.792 --> 40:37.834
Run!

40:55.709 --> 40:56.792
Let's jump!

41:20.792 --> 41:21.876
On three!

41:21.959 --> 41:23.001
One, two, three!

41:35.251 --> 41:38.542
Any of you who have ever
had to sweat through piano exercises

41:38.626 --> 41:40.792
will sympathize with these...

41:50.126 --> 41:52.001
I like it here,
but I don't like the name.

41:53.292 --> 41:54.501
Me, neither.

41:54.584 --> 41:58.417
"Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet"
It's got no ring to it.

41:59.126 --> 42:01.417
Let's change it.
What should it be?

42:02.459 --> 42:03.376
Let me think for a minute.

42:14.584 --> 42:16.542
I made you some jewelry.

42:21.042 --> 42:22.626
Are your ears pierced?

42:32.709 --> 42:33.917
It's pretty.

42:35.626 --> 42:37.209
Do the other one.

42:45.334 --> 42:47.751
Why do you
always use binoculars?

42:50.751 --> 42:54.084
It helps me see things
closer, even if they're not very far away.

42:54.834 --> 42:57.001
I pretend it's my magic power.

42:58.459 --> 43:00.376
That sounds like poetry.

43:00.459 --> 43:02.417
Poems don't always
have to rhyme, you know.

43:02.501 --> 43:05.126
They're just
supposed to be creative.

43:08.292 --> 43:11.959
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

43:12.376 --> 43:15.917
I don't know.
I want to go on adventures, I think.

43:16.001 --> 43:18.834
Not get stuck in one place.
How about you?

43:21.126 --> 43:24.584
Go on adventures, too.
Not get stuck, too.

43:24.667 --> 43:27.459
Anyway, we can't
predict the exact future.

43:28.376 --> 43:29.417
That's true.

43:32.042 --> 43:35.001
It's possible I may
wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean.

43:36.292 --> 43:37.334
Okay.

43:38.042 --> 43:40.167
I wish I didn't
have to mention it, but just in case.

43:40.251 --> 43:41.751
I don't want to
make you be offended.

43:43.292 --> 43:44.876
Of course I won't.

43:46.459 --> 43:48.167
What's that one for?

43:48.251 --> 43:49.626
- This?
- Yeah.

43:51.126 --> 43:52.501
It's not
an accomplishment button.

43:52.584 --> 43:54.459
I inherited it from my mother.

43:55.084 --> 43:58.334
It's not actually meant for a male to
wear, but I don't give a damn.

44:00.626 --> 44:02.501
Are your foster parents
still mad at you,

44:02.584 --> 44:04.459
for getting in trouble so much?

44:04.834 --> 44:06.876
I don't think so.

44:06.959 --> 44:08.959
We're starting to get to
know each other better.

44:09.042 --> 44:11.042
I feel I'm in
a real family now.

44:11.126 --> 44:13.042
Not like yours,
but similar to one.

44:14.334 --> 44:16.667
I always wished
I was an orphan.

44:16.751 --> 44:18.917
Most of my
favorite characters are.

44:19.001 --> 44:20.959
I think your lives
are more special.

44:24.542 --> 44:26.959
I love you, but you don't know
what you're talking about.

44:29.584 --> 44:31.084
I love you, too.

45:32.959 --> 45:35.001
- I've got sand in my mouth.
- Oh.

45:36.584 --> 45:38.209
Can you French kiss?

45:38.917 --> 45:41.376
I think so.
Is there any secret to it?

45:41.459 --> 45:43.542
The tongues touch each other.

45:43.626 --> 45:45.334
Okay, let's try it.

45:57.876 --> 45:59.251
It feels hard.

46:00.126 --> 46:01.167
Do you mind?

46:01.251 --> 46:02.292
I like it.

46:05.126 --> 46:06.417
Tilt your head sideways.

46:14.584 --> 46:16.292
You can touch my chest.

46:18.626 --> 46:21.209
I... I think they're
going to grow more.

46:30.167 --> 46:32.376
"The flashlight's
beam drew a moon through the black

46:32.459 --> 46:35.084
"across the attic
and settled on a gap in the baseboard.

46:35.167 --> 46:37.792
"A mouse hole,
no bigger than a pocket watch.

46:38.126 --> 46:39.751
"Eric crouched on his flat feet

46:39.834 --> 46:41.917
"and placed his hand in
front of the tiny opening.

46:42.001 --> 46:43.251
"'It's windy, ' he said.

46:43.334 --> 46:45.667
"'Like someone in there's
blowing on my fingers.'

46:45.751 --> 46:47.959
"Christy rolled her
eyes and sighed a sigh.

46:48.042 --> 46:49.709
"'He's right again, '
she thought.

46:49.792 --> 46:51.459
"'Little brothers
drive people crazy."'

46:57.626 --> 46:59.126
I'm listening. Read on.

47:01.292 --> 47:02.584
Part two.

47:33.417 --> 47:34.459
No!

48:14.917 --> 48:17.084
Dear Sam, it saddens
me to write this letter,

48:17.167 --> 48:19.167
but Mrs. Billingsley
and I have decided

48:19.251 --> 48:21.251
we cannot permit you
to return to our home.

48:21.334 --> 48:25.042
I know you mean well.
Do trust me, this is for the best.

48:25.126 --> 48:27.376
Godspeed, Herbert Billingsley.

48:39.126 --> 48:43.626
Be advised, the two of you will
never see each other again.

48:43.709 --> 48:47.584
Those were your last words.
Do you understand?

48:48.084 --> 48:49.626
I'd be careful if I were you.

48:49.709 --> 48:52.042
One of these days,
somebody's going to get pushed too far,

48:52.126 --> 48:53.876
and who knows what
they're capable of.

48:54.459 --> 48:55.792
Is that a threat?

48:56.292 --> 48:57.334
It's a warning.

48:57.417 --> 48:59.334
You're a traitor to our family.

48:59.417 --> 49:01.126
Good. I want to be.

49:18.709 --> 49:23.376
I'm sorry about this.
I didn't know your situation.

49:23.459 --> 49:25.501
It wasn't in the register.

49:26.584 --> 49:28.751
How'd you lose your parents?

49:29.959 --> 49:32.876
Never mind, I don't
need to ask about that.

49:36.542 --> 49:41.459
I wish we had time to do an
inspection back there. On the beach.

49:42.501 --> 49:45.667
I would have given
you a commendable.

49:45.751 --> 49:47.876
That was one of the
best pitched campsites I've ever seen.

49:47.959 --> 49:49.084
Honestly.

49:49.167 --> 49:50.501
Thank you.

49:53.667 --> 49:56.126
You don't want to be
a Khaki Scout anymore?

50:08.959 --> 50:10.001
Hello, Becky?

50:10.084 --> 50:13.334
Judy, I have your
person-to-person from New Penzance.

50:13.417 --> 50:14.459
Go ahead, New Penzance.

50:15.084 --> 50:16.584
Hello, this is Captain Sharp.

50:16.667 --> 50:19.042
Hello, Captain Sharp.
This is Social Services.

50:19.126 --> 50:21.709
I'm calling in reference to Sam
Shakusky, ward of the state.

50:21.792 --> 50:22.959
I understand he's
in your custody.

50:23.042 --> 50:24.167
That's correct.

50:24.251 --> 50:26.084
What's his condition?
Has he suffered

50:26.167 --> 50:28.417
any injury or
trauma of any kind?

50:28.501 --> 50:30.251
- He's fine.
- Very good.

50:30.334 --> 50:31.667
How do I get to you?

50:31.751 --> 50:33.292
The fastest way
would be sea plane.

50:33.417 --> 50:34.959
Jed can bring you
in with the mail.

50:35.042 --> 50:36.959
I'll come tomorrow morning,
if that's acceptable to you.

50:37.042 --> 50:38.834
Is someone able to
provide reasonable care

50:38.917 --> 50:40.542
and nourishment for
the boy until that time?

50:42.751 --> 50:43.792
Is that a yes?

50:47.001 --> 50:49.834
Very good, I'll contact you
again before the end of the day.

50:49.917 --> 50:51.001
Wait a second.

50:51.084 --> 50:52.292
Yes?

50:52.376 --> 50:53.542
Social Services?

50:53.626 --> 50:54.834
Captain Sharp?

50:55.959 --> 50:57.792
What's going to happen to him?

51:00.251 --> 51:03.584
Well, normally,
we try to place him in another foster home,

51:03.667 --> 51:05.792
but that option's no
longer available to us,

51:05.876 --> 51:08.084
in my opinion,
due to his case history.

51:08.167 --> 51:10.417
Which means he'll go
to Juvenile Refuge.

51:10.834 --> 51:13.334
Wait. What does that mean?
Is that an orphanage?

51:14.001 --> 51:15.042
Who's speaking?

51:15.459 --> 51:17.209
This is Scout Master
Randy Ward.

51:19.667 --> 51:21.251
Right, an orphanage.

51:25.292 --> 51:28.167
But the first step is
the admissions panel

51:28.251 --> 51:29.917
requires
a psychological evaluation

51:30.001 --> 51:32.417
to determine
whether or not the boy

51:32.501 --> 51:34.459
is a candidate for
institutional treatment

51:34.542 --> 51:37.084
or electroshock therapy.

51:37.167 --> 51:39.167
Excuse me. Shock therapy?

51:39.251 --> 51:41.417
Why would that
be called for? He's not violent.

51:41.917 --> 51:44.417
The report describes
an assault with scissors.

51:44.501 --> 51:45.667
That was the girl.

51:45.751 --> 51:46.917
That was the girl
that did that.

51:47.459 --> 51:52.501
Well, maybe she needs help,
too, but that's not our job. Okay?

51:56.292 --> 51:57.334
Okay.

52:33.792 --> 52:35.376
I'll be out back.

52:36.751 --> 52:39.417
I'm going to find
a tree to chop down.

52:44.334 --> 52:47.459
I do know what
you're feeling, Suzy-bean.

52:47.542 --> 52:51.501
I've had moments
myself where I say, "What am I doing here?"

52:51.584 --> 52:53.042
"Who made this decision?"

52:53.876 --> 52:57.042
"How could I allow myself
to do something so stupid?"

52:57.126 --> 52:59.459
"And why is it
still happening?"

53:01.292 --> 53:03.126
We women are more emotional...

53:03.209 --> 53:04.626
I hate you.

53:05.667 --> 53:06.959
Don't say "hate."

53:07.042 --> 53:08.501
Why not? I mean it.

53:09.376 --> 53:12.542
You think you mean it,
in this moment. You're trying to hurt me.

53:12.626 --> 53:13.834
Exactly.

53:15.292 --> 53:18.542
I know what you do
with that sad, dumb policeman.

53:25.376 --> 53:26.917
He's not dumb.

53:27.917 --> 53:30.167
But I guess he is kind of sad.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.542
Anyway,
we shouldn't discuss that.

53:33.626 --> 53:35.542
It's not appropriate
for me to even acknowledge

53:35.626 --> 53:38.126
what I already just said.

53:47.959 --> 53:49.292
Poor Suzy.

53:51.376 --> 53:53.834
Why is everything
so hard for you?

53:55.501 --> 54:00.501
We're in love. We just want to be
together. What's wrong with that?

54:05.584 --> 54:10.542
Oh, my God! How are we going to
get these fish hooks out?

54:13.834 --> 54:17.042
I admit we knew
we'd get in trouble. That part's true.

54:17.501 --> 54:21.084
We knew people would be
worried, and we still ran away, anyway.

54:21.167 --> 54:24.459
But something also happened,
which we didn't do on purpose.

54:24.542 --> 54:28.709
When we first met each other,
something happened to us.

54:30.292 --> 54:31.667
That's very eloquent.

54:32.292 --> 54:34.584
I can't argue against
anything you're saying.

54:35.251 --> 54:38.417
But then again, I don't have to,
'cause you're 12 years old.

54:40.709 --> 54:43.626
Look, let's face it.

54:45.251 --> 54:48.834
You're probably a much more
intelligent person than I am.

54:49.709 --> 54:51.876
In fact, I guarantee it.

54:51.959 --> 54:53.792
But even smart kids
stick their finger

54:53.876 --> 54:55.459
in electrical
sockets sometimes.

54:57.417 --> 54:59.834
It takes time to
figure things out.

55:00.542 --> 55:04.084
It's been proven by history.
All mankind makes mistakes.

55:06.084 --> 55:07.417
It's our job to
try to protect you

55:07.501 --> 55:10.709
from making the
dangerous ones, if we can.

55:10.792 --> 55:12.459
You want a slug?

55:22.792 --> 55:24.542
What's your rush?

55:24.626 --> 55:28.209
You've got your whole life
in front of yourself.

55:28.292 --> 55:29.667
Ahead of you, I mean.

55:30.001 --> 55:32.542
Maybe so.
Anyway, you're a bachelor.

55:34.001 --> 55:35.042
So are you.

55:35.126 --> 55:36.167
That's true.

55:38.959 --> 55:40.917
Did you love someone ever?

55:43.084 --> 55:44.292
Yes, I did.

55:44.376 --> 55:45.542
What happened?

55:47.459 --> 55:49.126
She didn't love me back.

55:53.667 --> 55:56.667
I'm sorry for your loss.

55:56.751 --> 55:58.542
Anyway, that's what
you're supposed to say.

56:23.626 --> 56:25.376
Scout Master's log.
September 4th.

56:44.626 --> 56:46.209
I heard he's going
to reform school.

56:46.292 --> 56:48.167
I heard that they're
going to take out a piece of his brain,

56:48.251 --> 56:49.751
send him to an insane asylum.

56:49.834 --> 56:50.959
I like his girl.

56:51.042 --> 56:52.126
She's too scruffy for me.

56:52.209 --> 56:53.417
Supposedly,
they got to third base.

56:53.501 --> 56:55.001
That's not true.
He just felt her up.

56:55.084 --> 56:56.126
Over shirt or under shirt?

56:58.042 --> 56:59.292
Damn us.

57:03.126 --> 57:05.126
It's none of our business.

57:10.334 --> 57:14.334
This troop has been
very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky.

57:14.417 --> 57:17.292
In fact, we've been
a bunch of mean jerks.

57:20.876 --> 57:22.667
Why's he so unpopular?

57:23.501 --> 57:26.042
I admit, supposedly,
he's emotionally disturbed,

57:26.126 --> 57:30.626
but he's also
a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?

57:30.709 --> 57:31.792
Nickleby?

57:32.626 --> 57:33.667
Deluca?

57:34.376 --> 57:35.417
Lazy-Eye?

57:35.917 --> 57:36.959
Gadge?

57:37.626 --> 57:40.709
He's a fellow Khaki Scout,
and he needs our help.

57:40.792 --> 57:42.542
Are we man enough to give that

57:42.626 --> 57:45.709
so part of his brain
doesn't get removed out of him?

57:46.542 --> 57:49.251
They were prepared
to die for each other out there.

57:52.876 --> 57:56.542
Okay. Okay. What do you need?

57:56.626 --> 57:58.542
For starters?
Three yards of chicken wire,

57:58.626 --> 58:00.876
some ripped up newspapers,
and a bucket of wheat paste.

58:28.459 --> 58:30.876
In other words, it's over.

58:30.959 --> 58:34.751
I guess so. For the moment.

58:34.834 --> 58:37.126
Until further notice.

58:37.209 --> 58:38.334
That's right.

58:38.417 --> 58:39.459
I understand.

58:41.001 --> 58:44.251
I have to do better,
for everybody.

58:44.334 --> 58:45.792
Except me.

58:45.876 --> 58:47.292
Except you.

58:48.417 --> 58:52.167
Well, I hope you can.
I think you will.

58:53.167 --> 58:55.459
You're doing the right thing.

59:10.001 --> 59:12.626
Who knows what's
going to happen, Duffy?

59:12.709 --> 59:14.459
I'll probably see you tomorrow.

59:56.626 --> 59:58.209
Get out of my chimney.

59:58.292 --> 59:59.459
Listen to me.

59:59.542 --> 01:00:02.626
We're here for friendship.
We're going to get you off this island.

01:00:02.709 --> 01:00:03.792
No, thanks.

01:00:03.876 --> 01:00:06.209
Yes, thanks.
This is an emergency rescue.

01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:10.251
It's worthless to me.
There's no point, not without Suzy.

01:00:15.959 --> 01:00:17.209
How'd you get here?

01:00:17.292 --> 01:00:18.959
They snuck me down
the laundry chute

01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:20.917
and left a papier-mâché
dummy in my bed.

01:00:21.292 --> 01:00:24.292
Diversion tactics.
Good thinking.

01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:42.751
Where we going?

01:00:42.834 --> 01:00:43.876
Fort Lebanon.

01:00:43.959 --> 01:00:47.042
My cousin Ben runs the Supply and
Resources outpost for the Hullabaloo.

01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:50.376
He's a Falcon Scout,
Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to do.

01:00:50.459 --> 01:00:52.001
Can we trust him?

01:00:52.084 --> 01:00:53.917
Normally, I'd say no.

01:00:55.709 --> 01:00:57.542
Did you leave
another note for Lionel?

01:00:57.626 --> 01:00:59.709
Not this time.
He can't keep his trap shut.

01:00:59.792 --> 01:01:01.459
Besides, I'll probably
never see him again.

01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:02.584
True.

01:01:19.751 --> 01:01:22.251
This is the island
of St. Jack Wood,

01:01:22.334 --> 01:01:24.042
extending far north
from Land's End

01:01:24.126 --> 01:01:27.459
along the deep water channel
that leads to Broken Rock.

01:01:31.292 --> 01:01:35.209
A low flood plain separates the
beach from the township above.

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:38.792
A small but
prosperous community.

01:01:38.876 --> 01:01:41.459
The barometer reads
28 inches and dropping.

01:01:41.542 --> 01:01:46.084
Strong winds, as you can see,
already at 22 knots.

01:01:49.126 --> 01:01:52.334
The time is now 4:35 a.m.

01:02:12.376 --> 01:02:16.876
Did you file the motion
of continuance? Peabody v. Henderson?

01:02:16.959 --> 01:02:18.209
It was sustained.

01:02:18.292 --> 01:02:19.542
Good.

01:02:21.126 --> 01:02:23.584
Did the judge consider
your application for leniency?

01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:25.001
Rogers v. Yentob?

01:02:25.084 --> 01:02:26.959
- He granted it.
- Great.

01:02:30.584 --> 01:02:32.126
I'm sorry, Walt.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:37.459
It's not your fault.

01:02:39.376 --> 01:02:43.209
Which injuries
are you apologizing for, specifically?

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:45.626
Specifically?

01:02:45.709 --> 01:02:48.042
Whichever ones still hurt.

01:02:48.959 --> 01:02:51.417
Half of those
were self-inflicted.

01:02:57.876 --> 01:03:01.709
I hope the roof flies off,
and I get sucked up into space.

01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:04.209
You'll be better
off without me.

01:03:06.126 --> 01:03:08.667
Stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:13.501
Why?

01:03:17.792 --> 01:03:19.959
We're all they've got, Walt.

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:29.751
That's not enough.

01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:40.209
"'But I'm not going, '
said Barnaby Jack.

01:03:40.292 --> 01:03:41.542
"'I'm running away
tonight for good.

01:03:41.626 --> 01:03:43.751
"'And this time I
won't get caught.'

01:03:43.834 --> 01:03:46.167
"Annabelle whispered,
'I'm coming with you.'

01:03:46.251 --> 01:03:48.042
"Her yellow hair,
now brown at the roots,

01:03:48.126 --> 01:03:49.917
"caught up in
the wind and danced.

01:03:50.001 --> 01:03:51.584
"Barnaby Jack
took Annabelle's hand

01:03:51.667 --> 01:03:54.334
"and pressed something into it
the size of a jellybean.

01:03:54.417 --> 01:03:57.417
"'Hide this in your socks,
and be ready at midnight."'

01:04:00.251 --> 01:04:01.917
Continue.

01:04:02.001 --> 01:04:03.042
Keep going.

01:04:03.126 --> 01:04:04.584
- Keep going.
- Go on.

01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:05.792
- We're listening.
- That's good.

01:04:07.626 --> 01:04:11.459
"He leapt out the window
and landed in the fresh fallen snow."

01:04:17.001 --> 01:04:19.626
Where's my record player?

01:05:30.001 --> 01:05:31.542
You're not going to
believe this one, sir.

01:05:31.626 --> 01:05:35.626
That Scout Master on
New Penzance has now lost his entire troop.

01:05:40.292 --> 01:05:42.292
Well, I'll be damned!

01:05:42.417 --> 01:05:43.542
Who is this bimbo?

01:05:43.626 --> 01:05:44.792
Couldn't say, sir.

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:02.792
Be right back.

01:06:07.042 --> 01:06:10.834
There's a broken gumball machine
right behind the snack tent.

01:06:12.459 --> 01:06:14.042
I don't care how they do it
where you come from.

01:06:14.126 --> 01:06:17.042
You want pop? You want candy?
You want a snake bite kit?

01:06:17.126 --> 01:06:18.251
Get some money.

01:06:18.334 --> 01:06:19.917
Cousin Ben?

01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:22.042
Come back in five minutes.

01:06:25.542 --> 01:06:26.584
Is this him?

01:06:26.667 --> 01:06:28.667
Field Mate Sam Shakusky,
Troop 55, resigned.

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.542
He's hot. Almost too hot.
What's in the can?

01:06:30.626 --> 01:06:32.042
$76, but it's mostly
in nickels.

01:06:32.126 --> 01:06:33.209
Give it to me.

01:06:33.292 --> 01:06:34.917
- Your badge in seamanship?
- Yes, sir.

01:06:35.001 --> 01:06:37.417
Good. There's a cold water
crabber moored off Broken Rock.

01:06:37.501 --> 01:06:38.667
The skipper owes me an IOU.

01:06:38.751 --> 01:06:40.917
We'll see if he
can take you on as a claw cracker.

01:06:41.001 --> 01:06:42.917
It won't be an easy life,
but it's better than shock therapy.

01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:44.209
Thank you, sir.

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:46.001
By the way,
where's the chapel tent?

01:06:46.084 --> 01:06:47.292
Back there,
but the padre's home with the mumps.

01:06:47.376 --> 01:06:48.542
Why do you ask?

01:06:48.626 --> 01:06:50.626
I want to bring my wife.

01:06:53.084 --> 01:06:54.501
But we're not married yet.

01:06:54.584 --> 01:06:55.709
You his girl?

01:06:55.792 --> 01:06:56.834
Yeah.

01:06:57.667 --> 01:06:59.709
Technically,
I'm a civil law scrivener.

01:06:59.792 --> 01:07:02.417
I'm authorized
to declare births, deaths, and marriages.

01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:04.084
You're kind of young.
You got a license?

01:07:04.167 --> 01:07:05.459
- No.
- No.

01:07:08.126 --> 01:07:10.001
I can't offer you
a legally binding union.

01:07:10.084 --> 01:07:11.584
It won't hold up in
the state, the county,

01:07:11.667 --> 01:07:13.042
or, frankly,
any courtroom in the world

01:07:13.126 --> 01:07:14.542
due to your age,
lack of a license,

01:07:14.626 --> 01:07:16.251
and failure to get
parental consent.

01:07:16.334 --> 01:07:18.917
But the ritual does
carry a very important

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.709
moral weight within yourselves.

01:07:20.792 --> 01:07:23.751
You can't enter
into this lightly. Look into my eyes.

01:07:23.834 --> 01:07:25.542
- Do you love each other?
- Yes, we do.

01:07:25.626 --> 01:07:26.709
But think about
what I'm saying.

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:27.834
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

01:07:27.917 --> 01:07:29.542
- Yes, we are.
- They're not listening to me.

01:07:29.626 --> 01:07:31.417
- Let me rephrase it.
- We're in a hurry.

01:07:31.501 --> 01:07:32.626
Are you chewing...

01:07:32.709 --> 01:07:34.126
Spit out the gum, sister.
In fact, everybody.

01:07:37.417 --> 01:07:38.667
I don't like
the snappy attitude.

01:07:38.751 --> 01:07:41.042
This is the most important decision
you've made in your lives.

01:07:41.126 --> 01:07:42.542
Go over by that trampoline
and talk it through

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:45.417
before you give me
another quick answer.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:04.376
We're sure.

01:08:04.459 --> 01:08:06.459
Okay. Let's do a blood test.

01:08:06.542 --> 01:08:08.042
Under the eye of God,

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:10.334
and within the boundaries of
this local jurisdiction,

01:08:10.417 --> 01:08:15.209
which we hereby consecrate on this
day, the 5th of September, 1965.

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:16.376
That's the end
of the short form.

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:18.417
Do any of the witnesses
have objections or remarks?

01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:20.876
Usually they don't. Skotak?

01:08:20.959 --> 01:08:23.167
Can we loan them the nickels?
I'm worried about their future.

01:08:23.251 --> 01:08:25.167
That's my fee.

01:08:25.251 --> 01:08:26.417
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

01:08:26.501 --> 01:08:29.917
What'd I just say?
That's my fee. I'm keeping the nickels.

01:08:38.501 --> 01:08:40.126
Okay, they can have
the tennis ball can.

01:08:40.876 --> 01:08:43.542
Sign here,
initial here and here.

01:08:44.417 --> 01:08:47.251
Take the carbon,
leave the Bible. Let's go.

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:18.042
Where are they going, again?

01:10:18.126 --> 01:10:20.709
He's going to work on a shrimper,
if I understand correctly.

01:10:20.792 --> 01:10:22.709
- I wish them well.
- Me, too.

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:24.584
Me, too.

01:10:24.667 --> 01:10:26.292
I think they're coming back.

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:31.126
- Be quick, sailor!
- What happened?

01:10:31.459 --> 01:10:33.417
She left her
binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent.

01:10:34.459 --> 01:10:35.501
Just leave them.

01:10:35.584 --> 01:10:37.417
We can't. It's her magic power!

01:10:50.459 --> 01:10:53.251
You killed your dog,
by the way.

01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:54.792
Snoopy?

01:10:56.209 --> 01:10:57.626
Well, it couldn't be helped.

01:11:00.459 --> 01:11:02.126
Why do you
consider me your enemy?

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:04.959
Because your
girlfriend stabbed me

01:11:05.042 --> 01:11:06.584
in the back with
lefty scissors.

01:11:07.459 --> 01:11:08.667
She's my wife now.

01:11:10.459 --> 01:11:11.751
Congratulations.

01:11:12.126 --> 01:11:15.959
Thank you, but I'm saying before
that, six weeks ago, from day one.

01:11:17.126 --> 01:11:18.959
Why don't you like me?

01:11:19.792 --> 01:11:22.959
Why should I? Nobody else does.

01:11:34.417 --> 01:11:37.042
My God! He's here!
The fugitive! Stop him!

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.709
Stop him!

01:12:35.459 --> 01:12:37.792
On this spot,
I'll fight no more, forever.

01:12:37.876 --> 01:12:40.001
Come and get me, you bastards!

01:12:54.292 --> 01:12:55.792
I'm okay.

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:00.209
Follow me.

01:13:07.334 --> 01:13:09.084
Company, let's go!

01:13:18.209 --> 01:13:19.876
Captain Sharp,
we've located the missing troop.

01:13:19.959 --> 01:13:22.042
They just fled camp.
We're in pursuit.

01:13:22.126 --> 01:13:23.751
They're accompanied
by a 12-year-old girl

01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:25.376
in knee socks
and Sunday school shoes.

01:13:25.459 --> 01:13:27.542
Stand by, Commander Pierce.

01:13:28.167 --> 01:13:29.876
Jed, re-route to St. Jack Wood.

01:13:29.959 --> 01:13:31.917
Tell Social Services
the boy's at Fort Lebanon.

01:13:32.001 --> 01:13:33.042
Roger that. Will comply.

01:13:33.126 --> 01:13:34.709
Notify the Bishops,
Suzy's there.

01:13:34.792 --> 01:13:35.876
Randy, you monitoring?

01:13:35.959 --> 01:13:38.084
Affirmative. I'm on my way.

01:13:39.292 --> 01:13:40.334
Hello?

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:41.459
Hello, Mr. Bishop?

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:43.459
Oh, dear God. Get the boys!

01:13:44.959 --> 01:13:46.626
Let's go! Right now!

01:13:47.126 --> 01:13:48.667
Tower control, this is Jed.

01:13:48.751 --> 01:13:52.751
Confirm coordinates for new
destination, Alpha two-two-seven-one-fiver.

01:13:52.834 --> 01:13:54.167
Looking pretty soupy up here.

01:13:54.251 --> 01:13:57.126
Wouldn't mind setting down
before the pot boils over.

01:13:57.209 --> 01:13:58.501
Hang on, Social Services.

01:14:18.417 --> 01:14:20.459
Once again, storm
waters have just breached

01:14:20.542 --> 01:14:22.209
the dam at
Black Beacon Reservoir.

01:14:22.292 --> 01:14:25.459
A flash flood alert is in effect.
Take immediate precautions

01:14:26.251 --> 01:14:28.042
That's coming our way.

01:14:28.126 --> 01:14:29.792
Did you find them?

01:14:29.876 --> 01:14:32.501
Prepare to mobilize
to higher ground.

01:14:34.834 --> 01:14:37.876
St. Jack's Church
is the designated storm shelter.

01:14:37.959 --> 01:14:40.959
Notify all Scouts to
muster outside my tent, on the double.

01:15:19.042 --> 01:15:21.042
Attention, company!

01:15:21.126 --> 01:15:22.751
Prepare for...

01:15:23.626 --> 01:15:24.959
Who's that?

01:15:35.251 --> 01:15:37.292
You call yourself
a Khaki Scout?

01:15:37.792 --> 01:15:38.834
Sorry, sir?

01:15:38.917 --> 01:15:41.459
Where's your goddamn troop,
you son of a bitch?

01:15:41.542 --> 01:15:42.876
You don't have them?

01:15:42.959 --> 01:15:45.334
They could get
killed out there!

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.542
I'm field stripping
you of your command.

01:15:57.417 --> 01:15:58.876
Attention, company!

01:15:58.959 --> 01:16:01.209
Prepare for
emergency evacuation!

01:16:01.292 --> 01:16:03.626
Sir, do you have your medicine?

01:16:05.042 --> 01:16:06.834
I'll be right back.

01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:43.209
Hold your positions!

01:17:14.042 --> 01:17:15.542
Company secretary,
status report.

01:17:15.626 --> 01:17:17.251
All accounted for,
Scout Master!

01:17:17.334 --> 01:17:20.751
Okay, boys,
we're going to make a run for it! Fall in!

01:17:20.834 --> 01:17:23.084
Let's move!

01:17:23.167 --> 01:17:25.376
Come on, follow me!

01:17:48.792 --> 01:17:50.126
Who's in charge here?

01:17:50.626 --> 01:17:51.709
Randy, what happened?

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:52.876
Take the commander off me!

01:17:54.542 --> 01:17:56.542
Suzy?

01:17:56.626 --> 01:17:58.876
Suzy? Sam?

01:17:58.959 --> 01:18:00.042
They ran away again.

01:18:02.834 --> 01:18:04.792
We got to go back out there.
I need volunteers.

01:18:04.876 --> 01:18:07.042
You, and you and you.

01:18:07.126 --> 01:18:08.959
- You?
- Are you all right?

01:18:09.042 --> 01:18:10.292
Of course I am.

01:18:23.001 --> 01:18:24.126
Where's the boy?

01:18:25.042 --> 01:18:26.251
We don't know yet.

01:18:26.626 --> 01:18:27.667
That's not acceptable.

01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:30.376
What do you
want me to say, lady?

01:18:30.459 --> 01:18:31.792
Somebody get
Jed a cup of coffee.

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:35.626
- You're Captain Sharp.
- That's correct.

01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:38.751
I'm Social Services. I remanded the
boy into your personal custody.

01:18:38.834 --> 01:18:40.167
You're responsible
for his safety.

01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:42.667
I'm told that
he's just been struck by lightning.

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:44.084
That's the first
I've heard of it.

01:18:44.167 --> 01:18:45.209
It's true.

01:18:45.292 --> 01:18:46.584
Scout Master Ward, I presume.

01:18:46.667 --> 01:18:47.709
Yes, ma'am.

01:18:47.792 --> 01:18:49.167
Your reputation precedes you.

01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:51.667
You two are
the most appallingly

01:18:51.751 --> 01:18:53.251
incompetent custodial guardians

01:18:53.334 --> 01:18:55.334
Social Services has
ever had the misfortune

01:18:55.417 --> 01:18:57.792
to encounter in
a 27-year career!

01:18:58.584 --> 01:19:00.167
What do you have to
say for yourselves?

01:19:00.251 --> 01:19:02.751
You can't do this.
They'll eat him alive in there.

01:19:02.834 --> 01:19:03.876
Where?

01:19:03.959 --> 01:19:05.376
What's the name
of the place again?

01:19:05.459 --> 01:19:08.376
Juvenile Refuge.

01:19:08.459 --> 01:19:10.084
Sounds like jail.

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:14.959
Just find the boy,
and deliver him to Social Services.

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:16.834
Nothing else is in your power.

01:19:16.917 --> 01:19:18.792
I'm sorry.
Can we get back to the rescue now?

01:19:18.917 --> 01:19:20.542
- Suzy is still out there.
- Who are you?

01:19:20.626 --> 01:19:22.751
Walt and Laura Bishop,
their daughter's the missing girl.

01:19:22.834 --> 01:19:23.876
The parents of the stabber?

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:26.042
I object to that description.
She was attacked.

01:19:26.126 --> 01:19:27.167
Excuse me?

01:19:27.251 --> 01:19:29.542
I want the details about that.
Where's the Scout she knifed?

01:19:29.626 --> 01:19:31.001
Right here.

01:19:31.084 --> 01:19:33.042
- Field Mate Redford, sir.
- What's his condition?

01:19:33.126 --> 01:19:34.667
He may suffer some limited
chronic kidney insufficiency.

01:19:34.751 --> 01:19:35.792
Here's the report.

01:19:35.876 --> 01:19:37.334
- We don't have time for that!
- She's right.

01:19:37.417 --> 01:19:39.001
- Let's go.
- Stop!

01:19:40.792 --> 01:19:42.459
Nobody's going anywhere.

01:19:44.626 --> 01:19:46.792
He's not getting shock therapy.

01:19:47.292 --> 01:19:51.042
That's it!
I am citing you for gross misconduct.

01:19:51.126 --> 01:19:52.376
You are hereby
summoned to appear...

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:53.626
I'm writing you up back!

01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:56.167
Be notified that
you stand accused of mistreatment...

01:19:56.251 --> 01:19:57.292
What are you talking about?

01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:58.417
I won't let you do it!

01:19:58.501 --> 01:19:59.542
Look!

01:20:08.126 --> 01:20:09.792
- They're gone.
- Who?

01:20:09.876 --> 01:20:11.667
- Suzy?
- Sam!

01:20:11.751 --> 01:20:12.792
- They're here?
- Yeah.

01:20:12.876 --> 01:20:15.251
Where'd they go? Answer me!

01:20:35.376 --> 01:20:37.667
Halt! Stop!

01:20:43.292 --> 01:20:44.584
Stay there.

01:20:44.667 --> 01:20:47.167
Wait, take these!

01:21:01.917 --> 01:21:04.209
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:06.001
Come down!

01:21:19.834 --> 01:21:22.084
Social Services,
do you read me? Over.

01:21:42.209 --> 01:21:43.417
We might have to swim for it.

01:21:45.376 --> 01:21:47.751
How deep is it?
I didn't bring my life jacket.

01:21:48.209 --> 01:21:50.667
I don't know, but if it's too
shallow, we'll break our necks anyway.

01:21:52.834 --> 01:21:54.209
Hang on to me.

01:21:55.584 --> 01:21:56.834
Okay.

01:21:58.292 --> 01:22:00.501
No, I'm not married, but
I'm a police officer.

01:22:00.584 --> 01:22:02.376
Application denied. I'm sorry.

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:05.001
I cannot authorize that. Over.

01:22:05.084 --> 01:22:07.501
Counselors, what's
the legal perspective? Over.

01:22:08.167 --> 01:22:10.709
In this state,
I would litigate with extreme confidence.

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:12.542
- I concur.
- Open with Article 15

01:22:12.626 --> 01:22:14.042
of the Codes of
Civic Jurisdiction.

01:22:14.126 --> 01:22:15.917
No party,
under any circumstances,

01:22:16.001 --> 01:22:17.501
shall be denied due
and proper consideration

01:22:17.584 --> 01:22:19.042
without prejudice
in perpetuity.

01:22:19.959 --> 01:22:21.126
On three again.

01:22:21.209 --> 01:22:22.376
Wait.

01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:25.584
Just in case this is a suicide

01:22:25.667 --> 01:22:28.209
or they capture us
and we never see each other again anymore,

01:22:28.292 --> 01:22:31.626
I just want to say
thank you for marrying me.

01:22:32.959 --> 01:22:35.334
I'm glad I got
to know you, Suzy.

01:22:47.917 --> 01:22:49.501
I think you've still
got lightning in you.

01:22:49.917 --> 01:22:50.959
Let's jump.

01:22:51.042 --> 01:22:52.667
No! God damn it!

01:22:55.126 --> 01:22:56.376
Tell him. Over.

01:22:56.459 --> 01:22:58.209
Captain Sharp is
offering to assume

01:22:58.292 --> 01:22:59.959
the responsibility
of foster parenthood.

01:23:00.959 --> 01:23:03.042
He wants you to live with him.

01:23:03.459 --> 01:23:05.792
Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky?

01:23:09.376 --> 01:23:10.626
What do you think, pal?

01:23:21.459 --> 01:23:23.001
We're coming down.
Over and out.

01:23:23.542 --> 01:23:24.959
They're coming down.
Over and...

01:23:43.042 --> 01:23:45.001
Don't let go.

01:23:52.417 --> 01:23:54.042
The Black Beacon
storm was considered

01:23:54.126 --> 01:23:55.876
by the US Department
of Inclement Weather

01:23:55.959 --> 01:23:58.834
to be the region's
most destructive meteorological event

01:23:58.917 --> 01:24:01.792
of the second half
of the 20th century.

01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:06.084
It lingered through six high
tides and inundated the islands

01:24:06.167 --> 01:24:09.917
with punishing winds
and extreme high waters.

01:24:10.834 --> 01:24:14.792
On St. Jack Wood,
powerful surges broke the arcade boardwalk

01:24:14.876 --> 01:24:18.167
and demolished
the village bandstand and casino.

01:24:19.209 --> 01:24:21.834
Scout Master's log.
October 10th.

01:24:21.917 --> 01:24:24.626
Reconstruction continues
increasingly ahead of schedule,

01:24:25.167 --> 01:24:27.209
which I attribute to
a particularly robust

01:24:27.292 --> 01:24:29.126
esprit de corps
among the troop.

01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:30.417
The latrine, however,
does continue to present...

01:24:30.501 --> 01:24:31.626
Excuse me, sir?

01:24:31.709 --> 01:24:33.667
- You've got the new recruit?
- Yes, sir.

01:24:33.751 --> 01:24:35.292
- What's his rank?
- He doesn't have one.

01:24:35.376 --> 01:24:37.042
Pigeon Scout.
Let's get him a patch.

01:24:37.126 --> 01:24:39.042
The coastal
areas of New Penzance

01:24:39.126 --> 01:24:41.084
were battered
and changed forever.

01:24:41.167 --> 01:24:42.751
Height.

01:24:43.626 --> 01:24:44.834
63 inches.

01:24:45.417 --> 01:24:48.251
Mile 3.25
Tidal Inlet was erased from the map.

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:52.167
But harvest yields
the following autumn

01:24:52.251 --> 01:24:54.959
far exceeded any
previously recorded,

01:24:55.876 --> 01:24:59.667
and the quality of the crops
was said to be extraordinary.

01:25:05.959 --> 01:25:08.542
So you see,
the composer Benjamin Britten

01:25:08.626 --> 01:25:11.126
has taken the whole
orchestra apart.

01:25:11.209 --> 01:25:14.126
Now he puts it
back together again in a fugue.

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:16.042
The instruments come
in one after another

01:25:16.126 --> 01:25:19.376
in the same order as before,
beginning with the piccolo.

01:25:19.459 --> 01:25:22.626
And at the end, when all the
instruments have finally come in...

01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:25.167
Suzy, Lionel,
Murray, Rudy, dinner!

01:25:25.251 --> 01:25:26.667
Melody, while
the other instruments...

01:25:27.292 --> 01:25:29.251
Don't make us ask twice!

01:25:53.084 --> 01:25:54.292
See you tomorrow.

01:27:00.167 --> 01:27:02.167
For Juman

01:29:46.001 --> 01:29:48.417
Now we will
demonstrate the orchestration

01:29:48.501 --> 01:29:51.209
of Monsieur Desplat's
musical suite.

01:29:51.292 --> 01:29:54.042
A little electronic
metronome sets the time.

01:29:55.459 --> 01:29:57.376
First, a harp.

01:30:02.792 --> 01:30:05.376
Next, pizzicato cellos.
