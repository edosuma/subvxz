00:02.170 --> 00:03.254
<i>Previously on</i>
Gotham...

00:03.546 --> 00:04.714
Father Creel.

00:06.758 --> 00:07.759
<i>Do you have the Wayne boy?</i>

00:07.926 --> 00:11.680
Not yet. There are some practical matters
that have to be resolved first.

00:12.430 --> 00:13.932
Oh!

00:15.433 --> 00:17.394
- Mr. Penguin?
- Help me.

00:17.769 --> 00:20.814
This is the name of the man
who killed your parents.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.107
<i>Sell me your company.</i>

00:22.399 --> 00:24.109
I will give you this as a signing gift.

00:24.275 --> 00:26.152
I've been a very bad girl.

00:26.361 --> 00:27.904
<i>You're a good woman.
You're just sick.</i>

00:31.783 --> 00:33.952
I knew you still had feelings for me.

00:34.119 --> 00:35.286
I want to show you something.

00:35.453 --> 00:36.496
You're under arrest!

00:37.872 --> 00:39.249
<i>May I ask what the charge is?</i>

00:39.958 --> 00:41.626
The kidnapping
and torture of Aubrey James.

00:41.793 --> 00:42.836
<i>No!</i>

00:43.044 --> 00:44.295
Tell me who killed them!

00:45.380 --> 00:46.798
Can you believe it still fits?

00:49.759 --> 00:51.010
Don't make me kill you.

00:51.261 --> 00:52.554
Do it, Jim. Do me.

00:53.138 --> 00:54.139
Kill him!

00:56.349 --> 00:57.684
- It's over.
- Not yet.

01:01.438 --> 01:02.439
Hold on.

01:02.647 --> 01:04.649
I love you, baby.

01:04.858 --> 01:06.317
No!

01:33.970 --> 01:35.013
All right, three bucks.

01:35.305 --> 01:36.306
Okay.

01:52.197 --> 01:54.282
Morning. Help you?

01:55.700 --> 01:57.577
I was told to order a Highsmith Royale.

01:58.536 --> 01:59.788
Bit early, don't you think?

02:00.497 --> 02:01.873
I said "Highsmith Royale."

02:02.540 --> 02:03.541
No ice.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.571
<i>Here you go, ma'am. You're up.</i>

02:44.582 --> 02:45.875
How may I help you?

02:46.793 --> 02:49.212
I need somebody killed,
and I heard that you employ the best.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.590
- Oh, yes! I know you.
<i>- One more round over here, please.</i>

02:52.799 --> 02:54.926
Our illustrious mayor's sister.

02:55.134 --> 02:57.262
Or should I say "ex-mayor"?

02:57.929 --> 03:00.348
Word is,
you're quite the deadeye yourself.

03:01.516 --> 03:02.642
Why come to us?

03:03.268 --> 03:05.061
Had an accident. My aim is off.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.857
Is this business? Personal?

03:09.023 --> 03:10.024
What's it matter to you?

03:10.191 --> 03:14.070
Personal costs extra.
There's always complications.

03:14.946 --> 03:15.947
It's business.

03:16.781 --> 03:17.824
A cop.

03:18.575 --> 03:23.454
Seems personal to me.
Anyhow, cops also cost extra.

03:23.621 --> 03:26.958
Fine. I want it done today.

03:29.836 --> 03:31.212
What kind of guarantee do I get?

03:31.379 --> 03:34.173
I accept a job, the job gets done. Period.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.843
You see, I believe in the beauty
of extreme measures.

03:37.719 --> 03:39.012
So, who's the lucky fellow?

03:51.774 --> 03:54.319
Ms. Kean has yet
to regain consciousness.

03:54.736 --> 03:59.490
With this kind of trauma, we have no
idea when she might wake up.

04:01.492 --> 04:02.493
If ever.

04:03.912 --> 04:07.665
But the medical wing at Arkham
is fully equipped to handle her condition.

04:09.626 --> 04:11.044
Will you be riding over with her?

04:13.046 --> 04:14.088
No.

04:25.850 --> 04:27.018
Hello, sleepyhead.

04:29.646 --> 04:30.688
Where am I?

04:30.855 --> 04:33.983
Rapid movement and elevated heart rate are
counterproductive to the healing process.

04:35.777 --> 04:37.320
- Don't kill--
- Apologies in advance.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.371
Rest up, my feathered friend.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.290
We have a big night ahead of us.

05:02.887 --> 05:03.930
Looking for this?

05:05.890 --> 05:06.891
Thank you.

05:07.809 --> 05:08.851
You left before I woke up.

05:09.185 --> 05:10.728
I know. I couldn't sleep.

05:11.187 --> 05:13.189
- Was I snoring?
- No.

05:13.356 --> 05:16.567
Are you sure?
My big, loud, rumbling, barnyard snore.

05:16.734 --> 05:19.153
I've heard complaints.
Neighbors. Airplanes.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.363
You don't snore.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.076
Look. I'm glad Galavan's been arrested.

05:26.452 --> 05:28.162
But he should pay
for everything he's done.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.708
I'm on my way to meet Barnes
at Galavan's penthouse.

05:31.958 --> 05:35.712
Hopefully, we can find some evidence
to corroborate Aubrey James' testimony.

05:36.045 --> 05:38.256
I got a call.
They're transferring Barbara to Arkham.

05:38.923 --> 05:41.592
I know. I stopped by Gotham General.

05:45.430 --> 05:46.639
You went to see her?

05:46.806 --> 05:49.642
She's a witness against Galavan.
I wanted to check on her condition.

05:49.809 --> 05:51.602
"Her condition" is she's in a coma.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.732
We never talked about what happened

05:55.898 --> 05:57.483
with you and Barbara in
that interrogation room.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.610
I know. Tonight?

06:00.069 --> 06:01.612
Sure. Tonight. Or right now.

06:01.779 --> 06:04.323
Lee, I went over to see her as part
of the case against Galavan.

06:04.490 --> 06:05.575
That is it.

06:05.742 --> 06:06.909
This isn't jealousy.

06:07.285 --> 06:08.786
That woman is...

06:09.704 --> 06:10.705
How do I put this?

06:10.872 --> 06:12.874
She's the devil. No, she is.
She's the devil.

06:13.041 --> 06:16.502
Lee, do you think I wanted things
to go the way they did?

06:17.795 --> 06:19.047
I had to play her game.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.382
I know. All right, forget about Barbara.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.426
Most people fight their dark side.

06:23.676 --> 06:26.012
Lately you find ways to give into it.

06:27.388 --> 06:30.641
That's a problem. For you and for us.

06:31.267 --> 06:33.770
I know. I hear you.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.314
Can we please just not
talk about this right now?

06:36.481 --> 06:37.482
I'm late to meet Barnes.

06:38.941 --> 06:39.942
I'll be fine.

06:49.327 --> 06:51.245
I wasn't sure
you'd ever want to see me again.

06:51.954 --> 06:52.997
When you called...

06:54.916 --> 06:56.918
You don't believe
what they're saying about my uncle,

06:58.336 --> 06:59.337
do you?

06:59.962 --> 07:02.256
No. Of course not.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.551
Silver, I asked you here
because I need your help.

07:05.885 --> 07:07.011
Anything.

07:08.846 --> 07:12.517
Before he was arrested, your uncle
made me an offer. I want--

07:12.683 --> 07:14.185
Right, Master Bruce! On your feet!

07:14.352 --> 07:16.187
Bought us a lovely couple of rakes
from the ironmongers.

07:16.521 --> 07:17.814
I suggest we get outside and get...

07:20.691 --> 07:21.943
Hello, Ms. St. Cloud.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.363
Did not expect to see you here.

07:25.863 --> 07:26.864
Hello, Alfred.

07:27.156 --> 07:30.034
That must have been your car
I saw idling on the main road.

07:31.327 --> 07:34.580
Now, in light of recent events,
I suggest you get in it and you leave.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.541
Immediately.

07:38.209 --> 07:39.877
I invited her and I want her to stay.

07:40.128 --> 07:41.129
And I'm ordering her to leave.

07:41.379 --> 07:42.630
And it's my house, and I give the orders!

07:42.797 --> 07:43.798
Oh, is that so?

07:44.841 --> 07:48.177
It's okay.
I don't want to cause any trouble.

07:48.344 --> 07:50.221
Smart girl. Off you pop.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.728
I'm at the Kane Hotel.

08:06.404 --> 08:07.905
You had no right to do that.

08:08.281 --> 08:09.407
I had every right.

08:11.075 --> 08:12.910
What were you thinking,
asking her up here?

08:15.413 --> 08:18.958
Wait, you think she was gonna
tell you something?

08:20.543 --> 08:23.171
If Galavan really has the name of my
parents' killer in that envelope,

08:23.337 --> 08:24.422
it's worth a shot.

08:24.589 --> 08:27.091
Well, my guess is, there was
absolutely nothing in that envelope.

08:27.258 --> 08:29.218
It was just a ruse
to get you to sign away the company.

08:29.385 --> 08:30.636
Galavan is smart.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.599
He wouldn't enter a multi-billion dollar
offer without his end of the bargain.

08:35.933 --> 08:36.934
He has the name.

08:37.101 --> 08:39.937
And you think that little minx is
gonna tell you something, do you?

08:41.272 --> 08:42.273
We're friends.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.566
No you're not.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.944
Getting information
out of a girl like that

08:47.153 --> 08:50.948
requires a level of deception that you
do not yet possess, Master Bruce.

08:52.909 --> 08:54.202
It is too dangerous.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.369
It's worth the risk.

08:55.870 --> 08:56.913
No.

08:58.039 --> 09:01.083
You will not see Ms. St. Cloud again

09:01.250 --> 09:03.461
or pursue Galavan's wild claims.

09:03.628 --> 09:05.379
You have no right to make
that decision for me.

09:05.588 --> 09:06.672
Well, someone has to.

09:07.632 --> 09:09.342
If you force me to be your jailer,

09:10.801 --> 09:12.553
then that is who I will be.

09:33.199 --> 09:34.492
Excuse me. Thank you.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.079
Press 56, please.

09:44.085 --> 09:45.169
You live here?

09:47.171 --> 09:48.172
No.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.174
Me neither.

09:51.092 --> 09:52.551
Lady's baby grand is flat, so...

09:54.345 --> 09:56.347
I don't mind making house calls.
I like my work.

09:58.349 --> 09:59.517
You like your work?

10:01.185 --> 10:02.520
Yeah. I do.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.355
I guess we're lucky.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.068
Hmm.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.490
Caramel?

10:15.241 --> 10:16.701
No, I'm good.

10:17.285 --> 10:18.577
You're missing out. They're good.

10:45.855 --> 10:47.231
Where the hell is Gordon?

11:20.431 --> 11:22.433
- Who is that?
- No idea.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.436
But he just tried to kill me.

11:26.854 --> 11:27.897
He tell you why?

11:28.230 --> 11:29.315
It wasn't random.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.276
Piano wire. Guy's a pro.

11:42.787 --> 11:43.829
No, wait. Wait!

12:00.346 --> 12:01.430
You feel lucky, Ned?

12:01.597 --> 12:03.057
<i>- All the way, all the way.</i>
<i>- We got this!</i>

12:03.224 --> 12:04.600
<i>Yeah. Here we go.</i>

12:07.645 --> 12:08.646
<i>Listen up.</i>

12:09.563 --> 12:12.983
Who wants a shot
at eighty-sixing one of Gotham's finest?

12:13.859 --> 12:17.571
I'm waiving any collateral fines.
Just do what you have to do.

12:18.406 --> 12:20.741
But Jim Gordon doesn't see the sun

12:21.992 --> 12:23.077
rise.

12:42.304 --> 12:43.389
You drugged me.

12:43.848 --> 12:45.474
That was for your own benefit,
Mr. Penguin.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.268
You have extensive injuries.

12:49.103 --> 12:50.146
I know you.

12:50.354 --> 12:53.524
Ed. Nygma.

12:55.359 --> 12:56.902
We met once before. At the G.C.P.D.

12:57.111 --> 12:58.154
You're not a cop.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.197
Oh. No, no, no.

13:00.573 --> 13:01.782
No, I'm in forensics.

13:05.244 --> 13:06.745
Do you believe in fate?

13:07.204 --> 13:08.330
Where are my clothes?

13:08.497 --> 13:10.040
Oh, I threw them away. They smelled.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.585
Oh, no. Oh, my...

13:12.793 --> 13:14.503
Uh, I'm afraid, sir, that you can't leave.

13:14.712 --> 13:16.338
If you sedate me again, I swear, I will--

13:16.547 --> 13:19.216
Sir! You are a wanted man.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.051
You can try and run,

13:21.218 --> 13:23.053
but with your condition you'll get
about three blocks.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.055
I'm afraid that you're stuck here
until you recover.

13:34.231 --> 13:37.234
Now, drink up. It's just water.

13:37.485 --> 13:40.070
Dehydration is common
after prolonged outdoor exposure.

13:44.909 --> 13:46.160
What do you want from me?

13:47.203 --> 13:48.871
Remember I had mentioned fate?

13:50.998 --> 13:54.543
Recently I've been going through
a sort of change.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.213
What kind of change, you ask?

13:57.421 --> 13:59.256
- I didn't.
- I've started murdering people.

14:07.765 --> 14:11.602
Wow. That is thrilling to say out loud.

14:15.272 --> 14:16.315
How many people?

14:16.482 --> 14:17.525
Three in total.

14:17.775 --> 14:19.276
Two of them I didn't really care for.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.821
But one was my girlfriend, Ms. Kringle.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.116
She was the love of my life.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.953
If you're planning on killing me,
could you get on with it?

14:29.119 --> 14:31.372
At this point, it would come
as a welcome relief.

14:31.622 --> 14:33.791
Oh, Heavens!
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.502
I have no ill intentions toward you.

14:36.669 --> 14:37.878
Then what are your intentions?

14:40.130 --> 14:42.800
I need advice, Mr. Penguin.

14:44.301 --> 14:48.764
These murders changed me.

14:50.683 --> 14:52.017
And like the butterfly,

14:52.643 --> 14:55.980
I've come to realize that I cannot
be a caterpillar once again.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.899
And you're one of the city's most
notorious killers.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.152
I brought you here, in part, because

15:02.611 --> 15:05.573
I was hoping you could guide me
on this new path.

15:09.910 --> 15:10.995
Listen, friend...

15:11.161 --> 15:12.162
Ed.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.082
Whatever.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.259
My empire is in ruins.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.597
I'm a wanted man
with no friends.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.434
And my mother,

15:35.227 --> 15:38.856
the one person I swore to protect,
is dead because of my weakness.

15:42.401 --> 15:44.153
Believe me when I tell you
that this path you're on

15:44.361 --> 15:46.572
leads to nothing but destruction and pain.

15:49.825 --> 15:50.826
So.

15:52.369 --> 15:53.871
Wanted or not,

15:55.164 --> 15:56.165
I'm leaving.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.590
Oh, my.

16:07.009 --> 16:10.429
Rise and shine. Hell with this.

16:12.931 --> 16:16.477
Who sent you? Huh? Who sent you?

16:18.228 --> 16:19.313
Your mother.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.525
That's what I was hoping you would say.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.404
No! What are you doing? No!

16:27.571 --> 16:29.740
Talk!

16:29.907 --> 16:33.869
Detective Gordon, stand down!
Stand down right now!

16:35.079 --> 16:36.330
Parks, watch the perp.

16:36.497 --> 16:37.790
Cortez, you shut the window.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.500
Come over here!

16:44.338 --> 16:46.757
You know damn well
I don't tolerate that type of behavior.

16:47.091 --> 16:48.676
And yet you pull that crap
right in front of me?

16:48.842 --> 16:49.885
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

16:50.052 --> 16:51.345
<i>Are you losing it, Gordon?</i>

16:51.929 --> 16:54.098
Has that church incident
messed with your mind?

16:54.306 --> 16:55.307
No, sir.

16:55.557 --> 16:58.102
<i>'Cause if I remember correctly,
you disobeying my orders</i>

16:58.268 --> 16:59.895
<i>is what landed you there
in the first place.</i>

17:00.062 --> 17:01.939
<i>I ordered you to turn that car around</i>

17:02.314 --> 17:04.608
and you ignored me
and drove straight into an ambush.

17:04.775 --> 17:07.277
And ended the day
putting Galavan behind bars.

17:08.445 --> 17:09.446
We need to push the boundaries.

17:09.613 --> 17:10.656
<i>Captain!</i>

17:27.631 --> 17:29.758
My employer has a strict protocol.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.889
If the first guy doesn't succeed,

17:37.141 --> 17:39.351
keep sending men until the job is done.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.480
None of you is making it
out of here alive.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.492
<i>When you get here, move carefully.</i>

17:55.868 --> 17:57.786
We don't know how many active skells
we're dealing with.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.581
All right. Two units on the way here.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.458
We just have to hold out till
they get here.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.710
Hey, uh, Cortez, kill the lights.

18:04.877 --> 18:07.963
Sir, I'm forensics. I don't have a gun.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.423
Grab something you can use as a weapon

18:09.590 --> 18:11.675
and stay behind us
as best you can, all right?

18:11.842 --> 18:13.844
Parks, take cover behind the desk.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.639
Remember your training.
Aim for center mass.

18:17.806 --> 18:18.849
Right. Center mass.

18:19.016 --> 18:21.351
And don't stop firing until you're sure.
And Parks?

18:21.518 --> 18:22.519
Yes, sir?

18:22.853 --> 18:23.854
Breathe.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.089
Help me!

18:51.715 --> 18:52.883
Drop the knife!

19:36.593 --> 19:38.470
- I'm leaving.
- Not gonna happen.

19:38.929 --> 19:42.015
Try to stop me.
I'll lop off her pretty little head.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.561
You know what I like about those glasses?

19:50.232 --> 19:51.775
They look like bull's-eyes.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.779
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

19:56.321 --> 19:59.283
Okay. We're not gonna hang around
for round two.

19:59.783 --> 20:02.119
Everybody load up
and let's get the hell out of here.

20:02.286 --> 20:03.287
I'm not leaving.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.038
That wasn't a request.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.791
This place is still our best bet for
evidence against Galavan.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.126
We leave, they'll destroy it.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.961
Now you're just looking for a fight.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.798
Parks, make sure the staircase is clear.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.052
I've got a civilian who's dead

20:19.511 --> 20:21.638
and a rookie
who's scared half out of her mind.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.683
You think we're gonna survive the
next attack with just a few handguns?

20:24.933 --> 20:26.351
We have to get out of here.

20:28.687 --> 20:29.688
Wait.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.696
A monk's cassock?

20:40.782 --> 20:41.783
<i>What the hell is this about?</i>

20:42.659 --> 20:45.329
I don't know,
but we have to get out of here. Let's go!

20:45.954 --> 20:47.581
Captain! Captain!

20:47.831 --> 20:49.625
This could be exactly what
we're looking for.

20:49.833 --> 20:50.834
Knife!

20:55.589 --> 20:58.383
Captain! Captain! You okay?

20:58.675 --> 21:00.552
It's just a scratch.
Let's get out of here.

21:00.802 --> 21:01.803
No! No!

21:02.429 --> 21:05.891
The knife punctured an artery.
You move, it could tear.

21:06.058 --> 21:07.935
What are you, a doctor now? I can move.

21:08.477 --> 21:11.229
You stand up, you'll bleed out in a
matter of minutes.

21:28.789 --> 21:31.291
Ta-da!

21:33.377 --> 21:34.419
Who's that?

21:34.586 --> 21:35.712
This is Mr. Leonard.

21:36.254 --> 21:38.882
You were talking in your sleep last night
about Galavan killing your mother.

21:39.841 --> 21:40.842
I was?

21:41.134 --> 21:42.219
Yes.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.515
Mr. Leonard works for Galavan.

21:46.848 --> 21:48.517
Before he was arrested, of course.

21:48.892 --> 21:49.893
Arrested?

21:50.143 --> 21:54.231
Detective Gordon arrested Galavan
for kidnapping Mayor James.

21:54.398 --> 21:56.566
He's in Blackgate.

21:58.902 --> 21:59.987
Huh.

22:01.238 --> 22:02.781
Oh. I thought you'd be pleased.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.120
It doesn't matter anymore.

22:09.830 --> 22:10.831
Why is he here?

22:11.415 --> 22:13.542
He was a gift for you.

22:14.251 --> 22:17.254
And what exactly
am I supposed to do with a Leonard?

22:17.421 --> 22:18.964
Kill him.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.843
I thought it might be nice to get some
retribution for your mother's death.

22:23.093 --> 22:25.262
That it might cheer you up a little.

22:26.638 --> 22:27.639
No?

22:55.417 --> 22:56.418
I'm done.

22:58.628 --> 22:59.629
I need some rest.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.008
And then I'm leaving Gotham forever.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.810
I really thought he would like you.

23:15.479 --> 23:16.688
What to do now?

23:46.510 --> 23:47.761
<i>Please! Please!</i>

23:47.928 --> 23:49.429
<i>Not my ear!</i>

23:50.472 --> 23:54.559
Why just smell the fear on your
victim, when you can taste it?

23:54.768 --> 23:55.811
Right?

24:02.234 --> 24:05.487
Help me! Help! Help!

24:08.865 --> 24:09.866
<i>Hola.</i>

24:10.033 --> 24:12.953
<i>Hola,</i> Eduardo. Long time.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.246
Yes.

24:16.790 --> 24:17.958
Just a moment, please.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.835
Help! Help!

24:25.006 --> 24:26.091
Are you on a job?

24:26.591 --> 24:28.885
It's not a job if you love what you do.

24:29.094 --> 24:30.470
<i>Oh. Fair enough.</i>

24:30.679 --> 24:34.224
Listen, I'm in a bit of a pinch over here.

24:34.391 --> 24:36.393
I thought my membership was revoked.

24:37.394 --> 24:39.688
<i>Bygones, darling. Live and let live.</i>

24:39.855 --> 24:42.524
So you eat people. Who am I to judge?

24:43.483 --> 24:48.155
The target is a Detective Gordon.
I'll make it worth your while.

24:48.989 --> 24:50.282
Send me the address.

25:03.211 --> 25:05.505
Death squads
have softer touches than you!

25:11.928 --> 25:13.972
At least Galavan goes top-shelf.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.310
The EMTs should be on their way.

25:18.768 --> 25:19.769
Yeah, sure.

25:20.145 --> 25:22.439
They'll be here
about the same time as our backup.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.280
So, you wanna tell me
what the hell's going on with you?

25:34.659 --> 25:36.077
In the church that day,

25:36.953 --> 25:39.372
Barbara accused me of having
a monster inside me.

25:40.790 --> 25:41.791
And?

25:42.459 --> 25:43.585
Lee seems to agree.

25:43.752 --> 25:45.670
She thinks I'm ready and willing
to give in to it.

25:45.837 --> 25:46.880
What do you think?

25:48.340 --> 25:49.424
There was a moment

25:51.509 --> 25:53.220
when I had the shotgun on Barbara.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.805
<i>She was taunting me to pull the trigger.</i>

25:56.806 --> 25:58.475
If Galavan's people hadn't busted in,

26:04.147 --> 26:05.148
I don't know.

26:06.066 --> 26:08.735
- But they did bust in.
- I nearly crossed the line.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.153
The line?

26:12.739 --> 26:14.824
Let me tell you something about the line.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.912
My third tour,
we were stationed in the desert.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.707
We captured three insurgents,
when this sandstorm kicks up.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.126
Zero visibility.

26:25.961 --> 26:28.004
Then we start taking fire,
we're getting lit up.

26:28.505 --> 26:32.592
Suddenly, I'm alone.
I come across one of our prisoners.

26:33.134 --> 26:36.054
He's a kid. His hands are zip-tied,

26:36.763 --> 26:38.056
but he figures "what the hell,"

26:38.682 --> 26:40.976
he's gonna use the sandstorm
to try to escape.

26:41.142 --> 26:42.143
So I jump him.

26:43.353 --> 26:46.898
And I take my gun
and I jam it in his mouth.

26:49.317 --> 26:53.405
I figured it was just a threat.
Show him who's boss, you know?

26:55.448 --> 26:56.574
Next thing I know,

26:58.535 --> 26:59.828
I just pulled the trigger.

27:03.206 --> 27:04.249
Blew his head off.

27:15.885 --> 27:18.722
That kid woke me up every night for years.

27:20.765 --> 27:22.267
Until I made my peace with him.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.897
So yeah,
I come to find out I'm just a man,

27:30.066 --> 27:34.321
and at the right moment,
a man might do anything.

27:36.740 --> 27:37.782
Any man.

27:40.035 --> 27:41.328
There is no line.

27:42.662 --> 27:44.080
There's just the law.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.666
That's what separates us
from the animals.

27:48.626 --> 27:49.794
There is no line.

27:58.636 --> 27:59.637
Alfred?

28:04.809 --> 28:07.729
I thought about what you said,
and you're right.

28:09.272 --> 28:11.274
Pursuing Galavan on my own is too risky.

28:12.317 --> 28:13.443
Well, you don't say.

28:13.610 --> 28:15.945
Best course of action is to call
Detective Gordon in the morning.

28:16.446 --> 28:17.447
<i>Enlist his help.</i>

28:17.614 --> 28:19.866
At last, some sense.

28:22.243 --> 28:23.787
You're thinking of retiring, are you, sir?

28:24.579 --> 28:26.373
Yeah. Yeah. I'm very tired.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.666
Right, can I get you anything to
eat before you go to bed?

28:29.417 --> 28:31.711
No. No, thank you, Alfred.

28:31.878 --> 28:32.962
Right, well sleep well.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.506
Oh. And, uh, Master Bruce,

28:34.756 --> 28:37.008
I sent that car off that's
parked at the end of the lane.

28:37.258 --> 28:38.259
You know, the taxi?

28:38.760 --> 28:40.428
<i>Don't worry, I gave him a right good tip.</i>

28:41.304 --> 28:43.890
I mean, after all, he did drive
all the way up here, didn't he?

28:45.892 --> 28:47.018
I didn't call a taxi.

28:47.185 --> 28:52.148
You really are the most terrible liar,
aren't you, Master Bruce?

28:57.987 --> 29:00.031
I will not stop pursuing this, Alfred.

29:00.198 --> 29:01.533
<i>I'm never going to give up.</i>

29:01.866 --> 29:03.076
And nor will I.

29:05.870 --> 29:06.996
Good night, sir.

29:24.222 --> 29:28.101
<i>Nothing will warm me more</i>

29:28.268 --> 29:32.230
<i>Than my, my mother's love</i>

29:34.732 --> 29:39.696
<i>I light another candle</i>

29:39.863 --> 29:43.867
<i>Dry the tears from my face</i>

29:44.033 --> 29:45.243
Why are you playing this song?

29:48.371 --> 29:51.499
<i>I can bring tears to your eyes
and resurrect the dead.</i>

29:52.417 --> 29:55.211
I form in an instant and last a lifetime.

29:56.171 --> 29:57.255
What am I?

29:57.547 --> 29:59.215
A memory. So what?

30:01.092 --> 30:02.886
You were humming this under your covers.

30:03.595 --> 30:05.388
I figure it has meaning for you.

30:12.645 --> 30:16.232
Every night when I was young,
my mother would sing that song to me

30:16.399 --> 30:18.485
when I was going to bed.

30:18.860 --> 30:22.238
And every time, she would tell me...

30:24.741 --> 30:25.783
"Oswald,

30:30.788 --> 30:32.165
"don't listen to the other children.

30:34.542 --> 30:37.462
"You're handsome and clever

30:39.881 --> 30:41.799
"and some day you will be a great man."

30:44.802 --> 30:46.513
She said that every time.

30:51.184 --> 30:52.685
That's all I have left now.

30:53.144 --> 30:54.270
Memories.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.440
And they're like daggers in my heart.

30:58.149 --> 30:59.275
Not forever.

31:03.446 --> 31:05.281
These were Ms. Kringle's.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.952
It's all I have left to remember her by.

31:09.619 --> 31:11.621
But when I look at these,
I don't feel sadness anymore.

31:13.081 --> 31:15.333
I feel gratitude. And do you know why?

31:15.542 --> 31:17.877
No. And I don't care.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.421
This little visit is over.

31:23.132 --> 31:25.552
I will just simply bid you <i>adieu.</i>

31:28.263 --> 31:29.639
Mr. Penguin.

31:32.225 --> 31:34.852
For some men,
love is a source of strength.

31:35.311 --> 31:37.897
But for you and I, it will always be
our most crippling weakness.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.774
Move aside, Ed.

31:39.983 --> 31:42.277
We are better off unencumbered.

31:45.530 --> 31:47.949
- What did you say?
- You said it yourself.

31:49.242 --> 31:53.913
Your mother is dead
because of your weakness.

31:54.455 --> 31:57.667
But what you need to realize
is that your weakness

31:58.668 --> 31:59.919
was her.

32:02.672 --> 32:04.549
My mother was a saint!

32:05.383 --> 32:09.345
The only person who truly cared about me.
And now she's gone.

32:10.054 --> 32:11.931
And I have nothing left!

32:12.181 --> 32:13.891
A man with nothing that he loves

32:17.228 --> 32:18.896
is a man that cannot be bargained.

32:19.063 --> 32:22.150
A man that cannot be betrayed.

32:22.525 --> 32:26.654
A man who answers to no one but himself.

32:26.988 --> 32:31.701
And that is the man that I see before me.

32:34.078 --> 32:35.246
A free man.

33:00.647 --> 33:03.608
<i>Are the EMTs with you?
Captain Barnes needs immediate attention.</i>

33:03.816 --> 33:05.026
Ambulance is still inbound.

33:05.193 --> 33:06.235
<i>We'll secure the perimeter.</i>

33:06.402 --> 33:09.280
<i>Wait. Hold on! Behind you! No!</i>

33:09.489 --> 33:12.033
Officer? Officer?

33:16.746 --> 33:17.747
<i>Hola.</i>

33:18.081 --> 33:20.083
<i>Detective Gordon, I presume?</i>

33:20.249 --> 33:22.710
- Who is this?
<i>- This is Eduardo Flamingo.</i>

33:23.586 --> 33:25.630
Is that name supposed
to mean something to me?

33:25.880 --> 33:27.674
<i>Not yet. But it will.</i>

33:29.092 --> 33:30.718
<i>I'll be upstairs in a few minutes.</i>

33:31.344 --> 33:33.346
<i>I'm going to feast on your friends first.</i>

33:33.763 --> 33:35.348
<i>Save you for dessert.</i>

33:37.058 --> 33:39.852
<i>If you try to run, I will find you.</i>

33:41.479 --> 33:44.857
I won't. In fact, I'm coming down.

33:46.693 --> 33:48.111
What the hell is going on down there?

33:48.277 --> 33:49.445
We've got another hit man.

33:49.862 --> 33:51.489
He's just taken out all of our backup.

33:52.240 --> 33:53.491
I'm going down to end this.

33:53.741 --> 33:57.620
You wh-- He's just killed four cops!
You're not going anywhere on your own!

33:57.829 --> 33:59.372
He's right. I'm coming with you.

33:59.539 --> 34:01.290
No. You're staying here.

34:01.457 --> 34:02.792
You need to make sure
he doesn't bleed out.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.961
I just said
you're not going down there solo.

34:05.461 --> 34:06.671
<i>We'll make them come to us.</i>

34:06.921 --> 34:08.715
We stay here, we're sitting ducks.

34:10.258 --> 34:11.467
He's after me, boss.

34:16.139 --> 34:17.140
Go.

36:46.289 --> 36:50.459
Oh, baby. You disappoint me.

36:51.627 --> 36:55.214
You have the right to remain silent.
I suggest you use it.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.518
I'll make sure he gets processed
and put in lockup.

37:07.685 --> 37:08.728
Thanks.

37:09.020 --> 37:12.440
Hey, Parks. You did good today.

37:27.538 --> 37:32.543
<i>For my mother looks over me</i>

37:32.710 --> 37:33.836
<i>And again!</i>

37:34.086 --> 37:39.425
<i>The fire has gone out
Wet snow from above</i>

37:39.634 --> 37:45.973
<i>And nothing will warm me more
Than my, my mother's love</i>

37:48.601 --> 37:50.895
What happened to that gentleman
you had tied up earlier?

37:52.188 --> 37:56.442
Galavan's lackey? Why do you ask?

38:07.912 --> 38:10.873
My mother always said a party's
not a party without entertainment.

38:46.951 --> 38:49.036
Sneaking out to see your girlfriend, huh?

38:50.121 --> 38:51.497
Selina, what are you doing here?

38:52.123 --> 38:54.250
Saving your ass from making a big mistake.

38:55.042 --> 38:57.545
Silver is bad news, Bruce.

38:57.878 --> 39:00.548
- You've said that before.
- This time, I have proof.

39:01.841 --> 39:02.842
You interested?

39:08.556 --> 39:11.267
You're going away for a long time,
Mr. Flamingo.

39:15.438 --> 39:16.522
Get up!

39:18.441 --> 39:20.192
I said, get up!

39:28.826 --> 39:29.910
<i>Let go!</i>

39:47.470 --> 39:49.138
- Lee--
- Hold still.

39:49.472 --> 39:51.599
Thank you.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.270
I almost crossed the line tonight.

39:56.687 --> 39:59.106
No kidding. How out of character.

40:00.149 --> 40:01.358
Scared me a little.

40:04.070 --> 40:05.321
Welcome to my world.

40:09.366 --> 40:10.826
Why the hell are you with me?

40:12.912 --> 40:13.913
Beats me.

40:22.463 --> 40:26.342
Just tell me the truth. Always.

40:32.139 --> 40:33.182
I promise.

40:44.068 --> 40:45.069
Uh-uh.

40:47.863 --> 40:51.033
Detective James Gordon's phone.
This is Lee Thompkins speaking.

40:52.326 --> 40:53.369
Hi, Alvarez.

40:57.665 --> 40:58.666
I'll tell him.

41:03.087 --> 41:06.715
Eduardo Flamingo killed Officer Parks
before they could get him into lockup.

41:26.402 --> 41:27.486
Hit men?

41:29.905 --> 41:33.492
You sent hit men after Jim Gordon?

41:33.784 --> 41:38.622
After I expressly told you to do
nothing until I gave you orders?

41:39.039 --> 41:40.082
Nothing.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.461
Tell me this isn't about Barbara.

41:46.088 --> 41:47.840
He hurt her.

41:48.883 --> 41:51.594
I'm disappointed that you let a
woman like that get in your head.

41:51.802 --> 41:55.097
If you're feeling upset,
find yourself a nice librarian to torture.

41:55.264 --> 41:56.432
That always cheers you up.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.684
Everything is ready.

42:00.186 --> 42:02.021
The brothers' arrival is imminent.

42:03.105 --> 42:04.273
Bruce Wayne will die,

42:04.523 --> 42:07.109
and his company
and this city will be mine.

42:07.359 --> 42:08.444
Ours.

42:09.862 --> 42:16.368
Everything that we have worked for,
for so long, will be ours.

42:17.620 --> 42:21.123
Endanger that prize again,
and though it breaks my heart,

42:21.707 --> 42:25.294
I will cut your throat.

42:39.600 --> 42:43.020
Welcome, brothers. Welcome.

42:44.104 --> 42:47.024
Hey! Docks are closed.

42:49.318 --> 42:50.694
I need to see some ID.

42:53.906 --> 42:55.157
Wait! No!

44:04.143 --> 44:05.144
English - SDH
