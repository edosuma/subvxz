WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.167
MOHINDER:
Previously on Heroes.

00:06.382 --> 00:07.918
We have a problem.

00:08.050 --> 00:10.086
Sylar, he's gone.

00:12.722 --> 00:14.508
Nathan, what are you...

00:15.850 --> 00:17.932
Hey.
I think I'm in trouble, Pete.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.263
Ever think that
we can just live, Noah?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.434
Out in the open?

00:21.522 --> 00:22.511
No.

00:22.607 --> 00:24.017
I'm a friend, Tracy.

00:24.108 --> 00:25.268
What is this place?

00:25.359 --> 00:26.348
Home.

00:26.444 --> 00:27.729
Please take this.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.651
To find your way back here.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.821
MATT: I pushed
Nathan's memories
into your mind.

00:32.909 --> 00:35.821
I made your body
think that it was him.

00:35.912 --> 00:37.402
I gotta go find Nathan.

00:37.496 --> 00:38.656
Get my body back.

00:38.789 --> 00:42.122
Then I kill
every single person
even remotely involved.

00:42.919 --> 00:43.954
Police! Freeze.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.205
What the hell
are you doing?

00:45.296 --> 00:46.376
l'm crossing that line.

00:46.464 --> 00:47.874
You idiot.
You'll die with me.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.045
I know.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.122
POLICEMAN: Gun!

00:53.471 --> 00:55.336
Where is Charlie?

00:55.431 --> 00:59.640
I'm the only one
who knows exactly where
your sweet Charlie is.

00:59.727 --> 01:04.471
And you can save her,
but only if you do exactly
what I ask you to do.

01:04.649 --> 01:06.389
SAMUEL: / made a mistake.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.145
About eight weeks ago.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.705
This green earth
has given us so much.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.246
Feels good to give
back what we can.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.578
Then why don't you
give back Charlie?

01:28.673 --> 01:30.584
You're an evil man,
Butterfly Man.

01:30.675 --> 01:33.712
You must release Charlie
from wherever
you are holding her.

01:33.803 --> 01:36.670
l have a way for you
to earn her freedom.

01:37.306 --> 01:41.094
I met a man eight weeks ago.
He had something I wanted.

01:42.853 --> 01:46.892
A film from 1961.
His name was
Mohinder Suresh.

01:46.983 --> 01:48.939
I know Dr. Suresh.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.517
I don't need to time travel.
I can find him right now.

01:51.654 --> 01:53.360
Dr. Suresh is dead.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.775
You killed Dr. Suresh?

01:56.450 --> 02:01.285
I need you to go back
eight weeks, Hiro.
To a motel room in Texas.

02:01.372 --> 02:02.452
To save his life?
No.

02:02.540 --> 02:05.327
To save that film,
before he destroyed it.

02:05.626 --> 02:09.869
Once you return,
deliver it to me, your sweet
Charlie will be set free.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.956
I don't know if I can
even time travel anymore.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.963
Then you're gonna
have to try
very, very hard.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.675
Your sweet
Charlie's life
depends on it.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.267
MAN: Samuel.
Yeah.

02:22.351 --> 02:23.636
We're done here.

02:23.728 --> 02:24.843
Let's go.

02:30.026 --> 02:32.688
GIRL: So India was
connected to Australia?

02:32.778 --> 02:35.565
Mmm-hmm. As well as
Madagascar and most
of Southern Africa.

02:36.157 --> 02:39.741
Now, together, they made
a supercontinent
called Pangaea.

02:39.827 --> 02:43.490
That is until
India broke off and began
to migrate north.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.788
Everything
keeps changing,
doesn't it?

02:45.875 --> 02:47.081
Indeed.

02:48.044 --> 02:49.284
Come on.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.336
MOHINDER: One of
the great lessons
of plate tectonics

02:52.423 --> 02:55.005
is that all things
are subject
to evolution,

02:55.092 --> 02:57.083
even the earth
beneath our feet.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.835
Remember to read
chapter six
before class.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.591
Thank you,
Dr. Suresh.

03:04.101 --> 03:07.059
Your students
adore you, Mohinder.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.307
Teaching is what
you were born to do.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.356
It does feel good
to be back
in the classroom again.

03:12.443 --> 03:16.436
Listen, lwas thinking
of making lamb biryani
for dinner tonight.

03:18.157 --> 03:20.773
You promised
you were going to
throw this away.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.857
lam.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.362
It was delivered
over a month ago.

03:23.454 --> 03:26.116
I assumed you meant
immediately.

03:26.791 --> 03:30.875
Look, it's all of
my father's work from
Coyote Sands in the '60s.

03:30.961 --> 03:34.499
And I didn't mean
to lie to you.
It's just hard to let go.

03:37.927 --> 03:42.261
We have
a good life, Mohinder.
A good, simple life here.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.339
Every time you dig into
your father's research,

03:44.433 --> 03:46.640
you disappear
into a rabbit hole.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.309
It only leads you
to a dark place.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.478
Perhaps you're right.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.211
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

04:30.187 --> 04:31.393
(SIGHS)

04:38.112 --> 04:39.602
You doing okay?

04:41.532 --> 04:44.239
You've been sitting here
staring at that poster
for two hours.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.282
You ever wonder
what it would be like?

04:46.370 --> 04:49.203
Running off and
joining a carnival?

04:49.290 --> 04:52.248
Yeah, that'd be
a dream come true.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.541
Living with a bunch
of fire-breathing freaks.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.458
Just because
they're different
doesn't make them freaks.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.461
Seriously, can you imagine
spending your life
in some trailer,

05:01.552 --> 05:03.463
moving from town to town?

05:03.554 --> 05:06.842
And you spend
your life where,
in some crappy diner?

05:10.019 --> 05:11.555
I'm sorry.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.760
Are you sure
you're okay?

05:12.855 --> 05:15.062
Yeah. I'm great.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.564
I'm fantastic.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.448
My God.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.695
I'm sorry.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.154
If something's going on,
we'll figure it out.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.581
Pete, it's not like
I lost my car keys.
I lost a week of my life.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.919
Yeah, and you woke up
in a carnival.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.868
You sure you want
to remember that?

05:39.757 --> 05:42.123
Senator Petrelli,
welcome back.

05:42.218 --> 05:43.958
It's good to be back,

05:44.512 --> 05:45.843
Elizabeth.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.888
Do me a favor.
Will you get my schedule out
of the front office, please?

05:48.974 --> 05:50.134
Sure.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.970
That was awfully casual.

05:57.066 --> 05:58.146
Yeah.

05:59.068 --> 06:00.649
I'm telling you, Pete,
it doesn't make sense.

06:00.736 --> 06:01.851
What's that?

06:01.946 --> 06:05.780
Even if my lost weekend
was just some crazy bender
under the big top,

06:05.866 --> 06:11.406
a senator going off the grid,
that ought to raise one or
two alarms, don't you think?

06:12.164 --> 06:13.995
Mom say anything
when you talked to her?

06:14.083 --> 06:16.790
She's in Washington,
wants to meet us here.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.209
What are you thinking?
Talk to me.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.161
I thought I had
a handle on this, Pete.

06:21.257 --> 06:24.715
But these last few weeks,
it's just been like
I don't know who I am anymore.

06:24.802 --> 06:28.294
You're just the last guy
I figured for
an identity crisis, Nathan.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.469
(EXHALES)

06:29.557 --> 06:30.763
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Senator?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.849
Go ahead.
The good news is,
your day's wide open.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.722
We cleared your calendar
when you went on vacation.

06:35.813 --> 06:36.973
Vacation?

06:37.064 --> 06:41.307
Sir, your mother said
you weren't sure how long
you'd be gone, so...

06:42.570 --> 06:44.060
My mother?
(MOUTHING)

06:44.154 --> 06:45.314
Right.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.487
Thank you.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.066
Déja vu.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.243
So sorry, you startled me.
Can I help you?

06:53.330 --> 06:54.581
PETER: Rene?

06:54.665 --> 06:55.745
It's okay.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.369
Did my mother send you?

06:58.460 --> 07:00.917
Don't come any closer.

07:01.005 --> 07:03.087
I've come here
to speak with Peter.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.293
Okay.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.499
It's okay. Come on.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.337
What are you
doing here?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.673
I came to
warn you, Peter.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.222
You need to
know the truth.

08:10.991 --> 08:11.980
Freeze!
(GASPS)

08:12.076 --> 08:14.988
Claire! Claire, it's me,
Tracy Strauss.

08:15.079 --> 08:18.663
And you were
breaking and entering in
my dad's apartment because...

08:18.749 --> 08:20.489
I really need
to see him.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.701
Yeah, well,
that's why God
invented doorbells.

08:23.796 --> 08:28.005
I didn't mean to.
I put my hand on
the doorknob and it just...

08:28.092 --> 08:30.003
Look, do you know
where he is?

08:30.094 --> 08:33.803
Something is going
wrong with my power.
I can't control it.

08:34.598 --> 08:36.930
I didn't know
where else to go.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.426
Tracy, you're freezing.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.470
(SIGHING)

08:45.984 --> 08:48.191
So this was my mother's idea
to clean up Nathan's mess?

08:48.278 --> 08:51.145
She sends you
to wipe out
our memories?

08:51.281 --> 08:53.613
It's what
she wants me to do,
but I cannot do it.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.482
Okay. And why is that?

08:56.286 --> 08:58.948
Your mother is blinded
by her emotions.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.786
There are some lines
that should
never be crossed.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.542
Why do you keep
looking at him?

09:05.629 --> 09:08.336
It is not up to me
to reveal this thing.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.961
The decision
must be yours.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.303
The answer you seek
is here.

09:17.182 --> 09:20.015
If you go, Peter,
go alone.

09:23.272 --> 09:27.015
What you discover
may be more terrible
than you can bear.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.456
This is
Dr. Chandra Suresh.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.458
And this is
entry number four,

10:32.549 --> 10:36.883
Coyote Sands
Relocation Center,
March 5th, 1961.

10:37.721 --> 10:41.339
I’ve been trying to
alert the authorities here
to the potential danger

10:41.433 --> 10:45.301
of gathering so many persons
with abilities
in one location.

10:45.395 --> 10:51.766
My concern centers around
an apparent force,
small but measurable,

10:51.902 --> 10:54.735
that emanates from
all such individuals.

10:54.822 --> 11:01.318
When two or more of
these forces are proximate,
they amplify exponential/y.

11:01.411 --> 11:05.074
Like a kind of gravity
or magnetism.

11:07.084 --> 11:11.043
An abnormal spike
in seismic activity
as of late

11:11.129 --> 11:15.668
appears to be emanating
from one of the individuals
being held here.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.920
A pregnant woman,
by the name of...

11:18.011 --> 11:19.387

11:19.471 --> 11:21.427
CHANDRA:
This is entry number 21.

11:21.515 --> 11:25.099
It is my intention
to document
the birth of the child.

11:25.185 --> 11:29.019
There has been an enormous
release of seismic activity
throughout the day.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.095
N U RSE: Doctor,
he’s crowning.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.852
I fear that this child
may indeed...

11:34.361 --> 11:37.569
I’m coming.
It’s okay.
It’s okay.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.146

11:39.575 --> 11:40.860
(BABY CRYING ON SCREEN)

11:40.951 --> 11:43.442
It’s okay.
Don ’t worry. Nurse!

(TRACY PANTING)

11:48.917 --> 11:50.123
(GASPS)

11:51.128 --> 11:52.584
You okay?
Yeah.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.046
It's better.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.967
Why is this
happening to me?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.098
(KETTLE WHISTLING)

12:07.811 --> 12:10.974
I thought it would be
a good idea
to make you some tea.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.850
You sure you're okay?

12:13.317 --> 12:14.807
Thanks, Claire.

12:26.038 --> 12:27.323
(SIGHING)

12:53.065 --> 12:54.475
What happened?

12:54.566 --> 12:56.773
The water
started to freeze.

12:56.860 --> 13:00.227
It is happening
over and over again,
and I can't stop it!

13:00.322 --> 13:03.530
Tracy, just calm down.
Try to take a deep breath.

13:07.663 --> 13:08.948
Claire?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.541
Can you hear me?

13:23.929 --> 13:25.214
Oh, my God.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.050
...six.

13:36.650 --> 13:40.518
I really thought
we were done with this
cloak and dagger stuff.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.115
I still can't figure out
why the Haitian
didn't want me in the loop.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.030
Well, doesn't matter now.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.865
PETER: This just gets
better and better.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.129
(CLATTERING)

13:59.464 --> 14:01.204
Check it out.
Yeah.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.416
We're good?
PETER: Good.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.595
What do you got?
It's a body.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.944
What is it?

14:29.870 --> 14:31.201
It's me.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.258
PETER: It's not you.

14:46.344 --> 14:50.383
It could be
a shape shifter or something.
It's just not...

14:50.474 --> 14:52.635
There's gotta be
a reason the Haitian
wanted you to see this.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.512
This is just weird.

14:55.771 --> 14:57.511
What?
It's all right.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.904
You're now
Nathan Petrelli.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.562
(PANTING)

15:07.657 --> 15:09.318
What did you see?

15:11.036 --> 15:14.949
Bits and pieces, I think.
A hotel room. Sylar.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.871
Sylar? That's old news.
The guy's been dead
for weeks.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.573
I know. I know.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.580
I heard Parkman.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.706
Matt?

15:22.798 --> 15:24.880
His voice, he was angry.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.089
Whatever's going on,

15:27.177 --> 15:29.384
we're not gonna
get any straight answers
out of Mom or the Haitian.

15:29.513 --> 15:30.593
Okay, so we
gotta find Matt.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.056
Where is he?
LA.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.005
Let's go find him.
You sure?

15:34.684 --> 15:36.720
I'm not sure
of anything.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.484
(GRUNTING)

15:47.364 --> 15:49.025
I'm gonna get you
in the bath.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.215

16:11.638 --> 16:15.847
No, I heal. I heal.
It's, like, what I do.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.299
(CHUCKLES)

16:21.189 --> 16:22.395
It's okay.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.986
Do you think
you ever really
know somebody?

16:34.077 --> 16:36.284
God. Are you
hearing yourself?

16:36.705 --> 16:37.785
Yeah.

16:39.249 --> 16:42.207
Look, you know what I see
when I look at all this?

16:43.170 --> 16:47.584
I see the big brother
who would let me win
by a nose when we would race.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.673
I see the Naval officer
who would
rearrange his leave

16:50.760 --> 16:55.845
so that I could have
a good birthday.
The past couple of years,

16:56.600 --> 16:58.841
I've seen a guy
that saved my ass
more than a few times.

16:58.935 --> 16:59.970
I made a lot of
mistakes, Pete.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.187
So have I.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.728
Don't beat yourself up
over it.

17:05.734 --> 17:06.849
Senator Petrelli.

17:06.943 --> 17:07.932
Yeah.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.438
I found something.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.071
I just hope this isn't
the Matt Parkman
you're looking for.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.817
He's in a hospital
in Texas, under guard.

17:16.912 --> 17:20.200
They're saying he tried
to commit suicide by cop.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.205
Thank you, Elizabeth.

17:25.712 --> 17:26.872
Multiple gunshot wounds.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.214
Yeah.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.254
He's in
critical condition.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.545
You know, Nathan,
I can heal people now.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.300
If we can get in,
I think I can save him.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.814
Hiro, tick-tock,
tick-tock.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.315
I'm trying.

17:56.326 --> 17:59.318
You can do this, Hiro.
I have faith in you.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.042
Mohinder?

19:03.435 --> 19:08.020
Mira, I have made
a remarkable discovery.

19:08.857 --> 19:11.473
There's a power,
an actual
quantifiable force...

19:11.568 --> 19:12.933
You promised me,
Mohinder.

19:13.028 --> 19:14.518
Mira, this is
important.

19:14.612 --> 19:19.322
Using my father's equations,
I built a device, a sort of
compass that I can use...

19:19.409 --> 19:21.320
Will you listen
to yourself?

19:21.411 --> 19:23.823
Possessed again
by these voices
in your head.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.246
You don't understand.
By following
this compass...

19:27.334 --> 19:28.494
Okay.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.626
If the child on that film
is still alive

19:31.713 --> 19:34.329
and surrounds himself
with a large enough
number of specials,

19:34.424 --> 19:35.379
he can become
the most...

19:35.467 --> 19:36.752
Stop.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.841
I'm begging you, Mohinder.

19:38.928 --> 19:42.386
Please think very carefully
about what you have.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.556
About what
you have to lose.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.348
I love you.

19:46.436 --> 19:50.429
But if you disappear again,
lwill not wait
for you to return.

Son of a bitch,
get out of my head!

21:17.110 --> 21:18.350
You're in the hospital.
I brought you back.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.982
No, you don't understand.
This is exactly what he wants.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.528
What's he talking about?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.651
Bring him closer,
Parkman.

21:24.742 --> 21:28.451
One touch is all I need,
then you can have
your miserable life back.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.278
I can have
my body back.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.613
Shutup!

21:31.708 --> 21:34.950
Hey, guys, run.
Get away from me
before he comes back.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.705
Before who comes back?
MATT: Sylar!

21:36.796 --> 21:37.785
Sylar's dead, Matt.

21:37.881 --> 21:38.961
No, he's in my head.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.505
He's trying to
control my mind.

21:41.593 --> 21:44.801
I know this sounds crazy,
but if he controls me,
if he gets my power,

21:44.888 --> 21:46.298
he's gonna jump back
into his body.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.971
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Matt.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.434
What do you mean,
"his body"?

21:50.518 --> 21:51.724
This should be good.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.602
Nathan, you're dead.

21:55.732 --> 21:59.350
Sylar murdered you.
He cut your throat.

21:59.444 --> 22:04.313
I used my power to
purge his mind from his body
and put your thoughts in.

22:04.407 --> 22:06.398
You're weakening,
Parkman.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.653
I'm not gonna
let you do this.

I don't have time
for all the
five stages of grief.

Yes, but I can
make it all right.

Nathan, get away from him.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.618
Stop!
It all adds up.

23:00.088 --> 23:03.251
These new powers
aren't mine,
they're Sylar's.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.048

Doesn't make sense.
I don't buy that.

into his body.

Come with me.

your brother may be capable

what you're talking about.

going to build the fire.

Damian could handle it.

a thing like that?

join the others

use your help.

into my head the way
he got into Parkman's...

has no idea,

how dangerous
he could become.

28:19.115 --> 28:20.855

small in number

power remains subdued.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.777

he can taste it,

circumstances,

been just fine.

with you, I don't think
it's physical.

with powers.

When did it start?

31:56.665 --> 31:58.326
Just this morning.

31:59.794 --> 32:02.001
I was sitting
in this diner
thinking about...

32:02.630 --> 32:03.995
About what?

32:06.675 --> 32:08.666
About changing everything.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.176
My entire life.

32:13.808 --> 32:15.924
I've been so lost, Claire.

32:17.311 --> 32:21.054
I tried so hard
to put my old life
back together,

32:21.148 --> 32:24.891
but once I did,
nothing fit anymore.

32:29.448 --> 32:33.987
Then I met
this strange man
named Samuel.

32:35.746 --> 32:37.532
He lives with
a group of people...

32:37.623 --> 32:40.865
Who all have abilities.
Yeah, I met him, too.

32:42.253 --> 32:44.335
He invited me
to join them,

32:44.421 --> 32:48.130
to move to this place
where we're all accepted.

32:51.387 --> 32:53.298
I think I might do it.

32:55.057 --> 32:58.549
Give up everything.
Start a new life.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.556
Maybe you should.

33:01.856 --> 33:04.814
Maybe that's what
your body is telling you
it wants.

33:07.153 --> 33:10.065
It's great to have
someone to talk to
about all this.

33:10.948 --> 33:14.065
It's hard to
find a friend out there
in the normal world.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.775
Someone you can trust.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.662
Yeah. I had
something like that.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.911
I'm pretty sure
that's over.

33:25.379 --> 33:29.418
It just sounded so good
on paper. "College."

33:31.177 --> 33:33.042
Now I'm starting
to wonder if...

33:33.137 --> 33:36.925
It's hard out there
for girls like us.

33:38.017 --> 33:39.507
(DOOR OPENING)

33:41.103 --> 33:42.343
Ladies.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.027
How was your day?

33:49.111 --> 33:50.396
You know,

33:51.322 --> 33:52.983
same old, same old.

34:06.587 --> 34:07.827
(SIGHING)

34:08.464 --> 34:11.171
I need to know
what was on that film.

34:11.258 --> 34:13.419
It's about my ability,
isn't it?

34:13.510 --> 34:17.674
A way for me
to increase my power
a thousandfold.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.839
Tell me!

34:19.934 --> 34:22.300
Your brother
warned me about you.

34:24.855 --> 34:27.847
After all these years,
he's been betraying me?

34:29.902 --> 34:33.645
Holding me back
so that he could
keep playing the king.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.909
This is
your last chance.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.112
Tell me what was
on that film.

34:43.207 --> 34:44.367
Neven

34:45.501 --> 34:46.911
I will learn the truth.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.709
And I will do everything
I can to stop you.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.469
(PANTING)

35:08.857 --> 35:10.188
I'm sorry.

35:19.410 --> 35:20.616
(GASPS)

35:21.161 --> 35:22.492
(COUGHING)

35:31.588 --> 35:32.623
Hiro?

35:32.715 --> 35:34.125
Hello, old friend.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.423
I'm not the Hiro Nakamura
you know.

35:40.514 --> 35:42.175
I've come eight weeks
from the future.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.551
To save my life?

35:43.642 --> 35:46.429
No. To save this film.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.557
In the future
I come from,
you were dead.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.314
I was murdered
right here
in this room.

35:53.193 --> 35:56.276
How did you know
Iwould need
that Kevlar vest?

35:56.363 --> 35:59.400
My time travel is
not so good lately.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.483
The first time I tried,
I arrived
10 minutes from now.

36:02.578 --> 36:04.068
Wasn't pretty.

36:06.123 --> 36:08.034
If I hadn't gone
right to Samuel,

36:08.125 --> 36:10.992
he would have never known
the secrets of his power.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.702
My investigation
has corrupted him.
We have to stop him, Hiro.

36:13.797 --> 36:15.253
And we will.

36:16.967 --> 36:19.458
But first, you have to
disappear for
eight more weeks,

36:19.553 --> 36:21.339
until he releases
Charlie.

36:21.430 --> 36:22.590
Charlie?

36:22.681 --> 36:23.670
Yes.

36:24.099 --> 36:27.933
Samuel is holding captive
the woman I love
until I deliver this film.

36:28.395 --> 36:29.771
Hiro, this man is
extremely dangerous.

36:29.855 --> 36:33.018
I can't just go away
for eight weeks while
he consolidates his power.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.599
Please. If he knew
I spared your life,

36:35.694 --> 36:37.901
he will never
release Charlie.

36:38.364 --> 36:41.697
I understand your concern.
And I appreciate
all that you've done for me,

36:41.784 --> 36:44.400
but our primary focus
must be stopping Samuel.

36:44.495 --> 36:46.201
I will not risk
Charlie's life.

36:46.288 --> 36:49.121
Well, then, we'll have to
agree to disagree, Hiro.

36:52.461 --> 36:55.203
If you will not disappear
until Charlie is safe,

36:55.297 --> 36:57.288
then lwill have to
make you disappear.

36:57.383 --> 36:58.964
What do you mean...

37:03.722 --> 37:05.007
Sorry.

37:07.476 --> 37:10.138
He used to say,
"Put your finger in a bucket
of water, pull it out,

37:10.229 --> 37:12.140
"and see how fast
the hole fills up."

37:12.231 --> 37:13.846
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

37:15.067 --> 37:17.683
It takes a lot to...
It takes a lot.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.654
You have your film.
Now I want Charlie.

37:30.499 --> 37:31.739
Soon.

37:33.877 --> 37:36.163
I'm sorry your friend
had to die.

37:49.518 --> 37:51.008
(DOOR OPENING)

37:54.523 --> 37:57.856
Mr. Ahmadi.
Time for your medication.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.979
My name is
Mohinder Suresh.

38:02.906 --> 38:05.318
My name is Mohinder...

38:21.592 --> 38:22.798
Janice, honey, it's me.

38:22.885 --> 38:25.001
Look, this is tough
to explain into a machine.

38:25.095 --> 38:26.710
Remember I told you
there was a guy
inside my head

38:26.805 --> 38:29.717
taking control of my mind,
a monster named Sylar?

38:29.808 --> 38:31.844
Well, Ijust want
to let you know

38:31.935 --> 38:34.927
the craziness
of the last few weeks
is finally over.

38:35.731 --> 38:37.892
And Sylar's gone.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.152
He's gone back
into his own body.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.103
I think he got
what he wanted.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.712
I'm not really sure
what I'm doing here.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.762
Not even sure
what I hope to find.

39:17.481 --> 39:20.939
I just know that
I can't go on living
my old life anymore.

39:23.779 --> 39:26.816
I'm glad you called, Tracy.
I hoped you would.

39:28.408 --> 39:31.024
I felt a real connection
between us.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.826
There's something
I'm gonna ask of you.

39:39.127 --> 39:41.539
A way for you
to use your gifts

39:41.630 --> 39:45.498
to help make this
a better world for
all people of abilities.

39:48.971 --> 39:51.963
Together we can
accomplish great things.

39:53.183 --> 39:56.892
You have
unique talents, Tracy.
People like you...

39:57.062 --> 39:58.472
(INAUDIBLE)

40:13.829 --> 40:18.072
Nathan, this idea,
this thought that you're...

40:18.166 --> 40:19.497
Sylar?

40:19.960 --> 40:20.949
Yeah.

40:21.044 --> 40:24.127
Change of voice,
change of face,
still him underneath.

40:26.341 --> 40:29.253
These hands have killed
dozens of people, Pete.

40:29.845 --> 40:31.460
Friends of ours.

40:32.014 --> 40:34.630
Whoever Nathan Petrelli was,
he's gone now.

40:35.183 --> 40:38.311
Just some random thoughts
in a mass murderer's head.

40:38.395 --> 40:41.182
Okay, look,
assuming that I believe
any of that,

40:43.859 --> 40:45.349
what would it matter?

40:45.444 --> 40:47.605
I mean, didn't Matt say
that he forced Sylar out?

40:47.696 --> 40:52.030
You really think Matt could
purge every sick thought
from that head?

40:55.037 --> 40:57.870
To the rest of the world,
I'm Nathan Petrelli, Pete,

40:58.874 --> 41:01.081
but every time
you look at me,

41:02.210 --> 41:04.826
the way you're looking
at me right now,

41:05.380 --> 41:07.416
you're gonna see Sylar.

41:09.718 --> 41:11.379
Tell me I'm wrong.

41:15.223 --> 41:16.963
Tell me I'm wrong, Pete.
