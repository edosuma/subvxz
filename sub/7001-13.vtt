01:12.680 --> 01:15.269
Hi, everybody, and welcome once again
to Tool Time. I'm Tim Taylor.

01:15.359 --> 01:17.349
- Of course, you all know Al.
- Borland.

01:17.439 --> 01:19.870
Al, why would they need
to know your last name?

01:19.959 --> 01:23.430
- You always tell them your last name.
- Al, if they don't know who I am,

01:23.519 --> 01:25.709
they won't know who you are. Right, Al?

01:25.799 --> 01:27.549
Borland.

01:29.239 --> 01:32.670
Well, we're gonna be hanging
some drywall today, Al Borland.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.430
That's right, Tim Taylor.

01:35.519 --> 01:38.670
Since we're hanging it,
maybe we'll need a noose.

01:39.879 --> 01:41.349
I don't think so, Tim.

01:43.319 --> 01:46.510
I'll be hanging the wallboard today
with my trusty Binford Crown hammer.

01:46.599 --> 01:49.310
It's one of the best you can buy.
When you're hanging wallboard.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.629
always make your nail flush.
That gives you the perfect dimple.

01:53.719 --> 01:57.189
- Suppose they call it a dimple because…
- No. I don't, Tim.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.909
Hanging drywall is actually pretty easy.
Easy procedure if you follow instructions.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.950
Matter of fact, if you follow
the proper instructions.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.629
it takes hardly any time at all.

02:06.719 --> 02:10.310
- Al. I didn't say to go yet.
- Well. I was…

02:10.400 --> 02:13.789
- I was just trying to speed things up.
- This isn't a race, Al.

02:13.879 --> 02:15.509
I know that, Tim.

02:15.599 --> 02:18.870
Because if it was.
I think you know what would happen.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.219
Yes. I do, Tim.

02:24.319 --> 02:27.030
Well…

02:27.120 --> 02:29.750
sounds like a challenge
from Mr Al Borland.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.830
You don't really wanna
compete with me, do ya?

02:31.919 --> 02:36.229
Well, Tim, when it comes to you and me,
there is no competition.

02:43.439 --> 02:46.629
Maybe the audience would like to see
a little wallboard race between Al and I.

02:46.719 --> 02:49.180
What do you think, folks?

02:49.960 --> 02:53.500
Let's see who can nail the bad boy
top to bottom first. Ready?

02:55.280 --> 02:57.270
Ready.

03:03.039 --> 03:04.590
- Set?
- Set.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.310
Go.

03:10.039 --> 03:13.659
Well. I guess it's pretty easy
to see who won that, Al.

03:13.759 --> 03:15.909
We have to tape our stuﬀ…

03:17.280 --> 03:19.270
Yes, it is, Tim.

03:25.479 --> 03:27.069
Randy.

03:27.159 --> 03:29.389
get this oﬀ of me right now.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.909
Dad, no man has ever escaped
Randy's handcuﬀs of death.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.560
- Let's spray Dad with Silly String.
- No, don't spray Dad.

03:36.639 --> 03:40.310
Cap those things. Take these oﬀ
right now, fun is fun. Come on.

03:40.400 --> 03:44.349
- What are the magic words?
- "No allowance."

03:47.080 --> 03:50.150
- Hey. Dad. I heard a great joke today.
- What was it?

03:50.240 --> 03:54.020
OK. What did the moron
have for breakfast?

03:54.120 --> 03:55.550
I don't know.

03:55.639 --> 03:58.870
This morning you had
scrambled eggs and toast.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.020
OK, it's family night.
What have we decided to do?

04:09.120 --> 04:12.069
- We want to play video games.
- Yeah!

04:12.159 --> 04:17.100
No. I think that we should
just stay home and play charades.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.310
Wait, wait, wait.
Bowling - how about bowling?

04:22.399 --> 04:24.629
- Haven't done that in a while.
- No…

04:24.720 --> 04:26.910
They got a video arcade
right there at the bowling alley.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.509
- Yeah, bowling!
- Go get your coats. Come on!

04:29.600 --> 04:31.670
It'll be fun, honey.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.949
- I got a great joke for you.
- What?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.709
What did the moron have for breakfast?

04:37.800 --> 04:40.629
Today you had cereal
and an English muﬀin.

04:45.279 --> 04:49.230
You're all wrong. I had rye toast.
Ha-ha-ha!

04:49.319 --> 04:50.790
- Shotgun!
- Hey, no way!

04:50.879 --> 04:53.629
Hey. I ride shotgun!

04:53.720 --> 04:55.589
So, since we are bowling tonight.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.870
promise me you won't behave
like an obnoxious jerk.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.870
What kind of jerk
would you like me to be?

05:00.959 --> 05:03.069
You know what I mean.
You're obsessed with winning.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.069
You're the most competitive person
I know.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.949
And when you do win, you always
do that obnoxious victory dance.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.790
"Na, na, na, na.
I won. I won. I won."

05:11.600 --> 05:13.829
Oh, you frighten me sometimes, honey.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.709
You're just doing that
because you always lose.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.180
Always lose?
We only play once a year.

05:18.279 --> 05:21.870
And you always lose.
You can't help you're a lousy bowler.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.949
You're a woman.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.540
Nothing gets by you, huh, Tim?

05:29.319 --> 05:34.259
The point I'm trying to make is, it's not
fair for women to compete with men.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.829
Heck, men, we're stronger,
we throw the ball harder.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.269
We're stronger,
so we throw the ball harder.

05:43.399 --> 05:46.069
Well put, Tim. Now, you're not
gonna behave like a jerk tonight

05:46.160 --> 05:49.029
because we're not going to compete.
We're not gonna keep score.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.500
- How do we know who wins?
- We don't care about winning.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.430
We only care about having fun.

05:54.519 --> 05:57.079
All right, we'll have fun.
You'll have fun.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.149
We won't keep score.
We won't compete.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.069
- All right.
- Race you to the car.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.310
- No.
- Come on, come on. In three. One…

06:04.399 --> 06:06.589
- This is stupid. I'm not doing it.
- One, mo…

06:06.680 --> 06:08.870
Besides, your shoelace is untied. Three!

06:13.279 --> 06:17.029
OK, this is all you're gonna get.
Don't come begging for more quarters.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.350
Thanks. Mom.

06:19.439 --> 06:23.430
Tim, what is this? I thought you said
we weren't gonna keep score.

06:23.519 --> 06:26.110
I'm putting our names down
so we'll know whose turn it is.

06:26.199 --> 06:29.029
There's only mo of us playing.
After my turn, whose turn is it?

06:29.120 --> 06:31.500
I don't know.
Let me check the sheet.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.949
Well, look at that. It's my turn.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.100
Just shut up and bowl.

06:37.199 --> 06:39.430
OK.

06:40.240 --> 06:44.149
Mark, you're gonna be seeing
raw power in motion.

06:45.279 --> 06:49.189
Raw power in the form of precision,
fluid movements

06:49.279 --> 06:54.399
with a bowling pin-type radar
that will destroy everything in its path.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.550
Gutter ball.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.310
I had a little muscle cramp or something.

07:14.759 --> 07:17.870
You always got to warm up
before you bowl that first one.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.750
Well, now. I show no mercy at all.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.750
See that one pin still shaking over there?

07:23.839 --> 07:27.829
You know why that's shakin'?
Cos that pin knows what's coming.

07:27.920 --> 07:33.269
That pin's going. "Please, please,
master bowler, don't hit me!"

07:34.360 --> 07:36.920
You're dead, pin. You're dead!

07:37.000 --> 07:40.779
You and your nine scrawny friends, too.

07:44.959 --> 07:46.949
Yes.

07:47.399 --> 07:51.389
Yay, Daddy! You did it!
You knocked down that one pin!

07:53.839 --> 07:58.699
Yeah, and you left
his nine scrawny friends.

07:58.800 --> 08:03.819
Jill, would you walk down in the alley
and dress up like a bowling pin for me?

08:03.920 --> 08:07.790
Well, that is the one place
I wouldn't get hit by a bowling ball.

08:12.800 --> 08:17.310
Look at this guy. He has 120.000 points.
Randy, what's your best?

08:17.399 --> 08:19.959
A million five, but tonight
I'm gonna beat it.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.910
and it's gonna say my initials. "RT",
right on the top of the screen.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.790
Hey! Hey!

08:27.560 --> 08:29.829
- What?
- That's my machine.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.230
Oh, yeah?
Is your name Zaxxon?

08:33.320 --> 08:36.909
I just put a quarter in it.
You can play the next game.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.629
What if I want to play this one?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.710
Well, well, well.
Looks like I got a free game.

08:42.799 --> 08:46.419
- Hey, that's my quarter.
- Duh, really?

08:46.519 --> 08:49.190
Hey, duh, you better
let my brother play the game.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.740
Oh, you really got me worried.
It always scares me

08:51.840 --> 08:53.950
when I can see the top
of somebody's head.

08:55.759 --> 08:57.830
- Brad, come on.
- We don't have to take this.

08:57.919 --> 09:00.590
- Yes, we do.
- Oh, my God.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.820
Hey, duh.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.990
If it wasn't for my brother,
you'd be dead meat.

09:13.399 --> 09:17.789
I hope the ball gets to the pins
before the lanes close, hon.

09:17.879 --> 09:20.440
Please, please… Yes, yes!

09:21.279 --> 09:23.269
You knocked them all down!

09:23.360 --> 09:25.919
Yes, honey.
That's called a strike.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.669
You didn't knock them down.
They dropped dead from boredom.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.909
Hey, it doesn't matter how they get down.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.299
as long as they get down.

09:37.399 --> 09:39.909
Wait a minute. What's this.
"We're not gonna compete.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.269
we're just here for fun"?
What's this all about?

09:42.360 --> 09:46.750
Well. I'm not keeping score here.
I'm just writing down that I got a strike.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.669
If you like. I can write down
that you got a "one".

09:52.639 --> 09:55.470
The only reason you got a strike
is cos we're not competing.

09:55.559 --> 09:59.259
Oh. So, if we were competing,
then you'd be throwing the strikes

09:59.360 --> 10:01.190
and I'd be throwing the gutter balls?

10:01.279 --> 10:04.899
Yes, because women
collapse under pressure.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.909
Oh, really? Well, that last ball
was a practice ball.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.350
This one counts.
We're keeping score.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.389
I thought you didn't want to keep score.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.110
Is the great, big, bad bowling man

10:17.200 --> 10:20.509
afraid his itty-bitty wife
is gonna beat him?

10:21.639 --> 10:24.389
Is the itty-bitty wife

10:24.480 --> 10:29.070
afraid the great, big bowling man
is gonna leave her in the parking lot?

10:34.240 --> 10:37.350
OK, we're having some fun now.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.669
- Atchoo!
- Gesundheit.

10:43.559 --> 10:48.789
Please, please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please…

10:48.879 --> 10:52.110
Yes! Two strikes in a row! Yes!

10:54.039 --> 10:57.580
Ha! I sucked you in now.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.669
It's time for the real bowling to start now.

11:01.759 --> 11:04.320
Go. Daddy! Hit another pin!

11:10.320 --> 11:12.429
Hey, Timmy!

11:14.080 --> 11:16.309
Hey, sorry, pal.
Didn't mean to throw you.

11:16.399 --> 11:20.179
- Hey. Rock! Hey. Dwayne. Pete.
- How you doin'?

11:20.279 --> 11:22.950
You remember these guys
from the cooking show on Tool Time?

11:23.039 --> 11:24.990
- This is my wife, Jill.
- Nice to meet you.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.470
- My youngest boy, Mark, and my ball.
- Hey, hey. Roger!

11:28.559 --> 11:32.230
Were gonna be bowling next
to a superstar. You recognize that guy?

11:32.320 --> 11:35.750
Yeah, sure do. How you doing?
It's Tim "the Tool Man" Taylor.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.870
He works with Al.
You know. I love Al.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.590
Oh, Al's great!

11:40.679 --> 11:43.059
- Hey, we all love Al.
- Yeah.

11:43.159 --> 11:45.720
Hey, we're gonna be practicing
right here next to ya.

11:45.799 --> 11:48.360
We got a league game tonight!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.149
Boy, Pete, it sure is
gonna be intimidating

11:51.240 --> 11:53.669
bowling next to a celebrity
like Tim Taylor.

11:53.759 --> 11:55.990
- Oh, you got that right.
- Hey, Tim.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.070
I bet you got a real high average, huh?

11:58.159 --> 12:04.070
I don't like to brag, you know, but
I've knocked a few pins down in my day.

12:04.159 --> 12:06.990
I know of one tonight.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.350
Come on, guys, we got a game soon.
Let's get ready.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.629
Yeah, you folks go right ahead.
Just pretend we're not even here.

12:13.720 --> 12:16.549
- Good to see you, guys.
- Yeah, you, too, Timmy.

12:25.559 --> 12:28.669
- Guys!
- Sorry.

12:41.639 --> 12:46.309
Hey, you knocked down all their pins!

12:49.159 --> 12:53.230
- Come on, guys, that's a joke!
- Oh, that's a great joke!

12:53.320 --> 12:57.909
Hey! Hey, anybody can knock down
the pins in their own lane.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.509
Oh, yeah.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.350
Oh, man, awesome!
You're gonna beat the record.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.389
Shh. You're breaking my concentration.

13:08.480 --> 13:12.710
- He's gonna break whose record?
- The guy in first place. CP.

13:12.799 --> 13:16.500
- Hey, hey, those are my initials.
- Bummer.

13:18.240 --> 13:21.779
- I don't have to play.
- No, play. Hės gonna beat your record.

13:21.879 --> 13:23.309
- No. I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

13:23.399 --> 13:25.230
- No. I'm not.
- No, he's not!

13:25.320 --> 13:28.629
You see, this machine
breaks down all the time.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.590
See? Broken.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.139
You didn't have to pull the plug.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.230
So I did. What are you
gonna do about it?

13:37.320 --> 13:40.940
- Hey, don't shove my brother.
- What, you mean like this?

13:43.200 --> 13:47.110
Look, you win, cos you're bigger.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.710
you're stronger…

13:49.799 --> 13:52.470
I just wanna say one thing.

13:52.559 --> 13:53.909
What?

14:04.600 --> 14:07.230
Come on, come on. Let him go!

14:07.320 --> 14:11.830
No, first say…
that I'm the king of Zaxxon.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.950
Don't do anything he says, Randy!

14:15.039 --> 14:17.340
- If I say it, will you let him go?
- Maybe.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.549
OK, you're the king of Zaxxon.
Now, let him go.

14:20.639 --> 14:24.029
No, first, I want you to tell me

14:24.120 --> 14:27.309
that I'm the best-looking guy
in the bowling alley.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.269
Oh, gag me!

14:30.240 --> 14:33.029
OK, you're the best-looking guy here.

14:33.559 --> 14:35.940
Hey, thanks for the compliment.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.539
And don't touch my machine again.

14:48.399 --> 14:51.389
- That guy was a dipwad.
- No kidding, but why'd you give in?

14:51.480 --> 14:54.230
I was just getting ready
to make my move.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.070
Yeah, to the hospital.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.190
How could you say
he was the king of Zaxxon?

15:01.279 --> 15:03.990
You're ten times better than him.

15:08.799 --> 15:12.269
forget about that.
We've got to get even with this guy.

15:12.360 --> 15:16.230
- I could jump him from behind.
- And he'll wedge you into the floor.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.350
You got a better idea?

15:19.080 --> 15:23.350
- Yeah. I do. Come on, follow me.
- OK.

15:28.320 --> 15:33.549
Please, please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please…

15:33.639 --> 15:36.309
Yeah!

15:36.399 --> 15:40.669
Hey. Mrs Taylor,
four strikes in a row!

15:40.759 --> 15:43.269
Uh. I don't mean
to criticize you there, Timmy.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.309
but you didn't carry over her last strike.

15:45.399 --> 15:49.149
See, that would make that
a 1 34, not a 124.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.110
Good eye. Rock.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.350
- Mark, Mark, come on.
- Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?

15:57.440 --> 15:59.309
- Mark's coming with us.
- Yeah.

15:59.399 --> 16:01.549
- Well. OK, but you keep an eye on him.
- Yeah.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.629
Tim, you're really taking this well.

16:04.720 --> 16:09.350
I mean, if my wife were beating the pants
oﬀ me. I'd be looking for a place to hide.

16:09.440 --> 16:13.350
Actually. Rock. I'm trying to go easy
on my wife. She's had a bad week.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.429
Her mom was convicted
of grand theft auto.

16:18.559 --> 16:20.990
You're a good man, Tim.

16:22.039 --> 16:26.269
Excuse me, ma'am,
but you are an extraordinary bowler.

16:26.360 --> 16:31.070
Oh, well, thank you,
but I don't think I'm very extraordinary.

16:31.159 --> 16:34.070
It's just that
my approach to the game

16:34.159 --> 16:36.720
is somewhat diﬀerent than Tim's.

16:36.799 --> 16:39.179
And better.

16:39.279 --> 16:42.950
Me and Pete, we was wondering,
what is your secret?

16:44.159 --> 16:46.110
No, it sounds too stupid.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.230
- Oh, come on, honey, tell them.
- Yeah.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.059
Well. OK. I will.

16:52.159 --> 16:56.710
I know it sounds silly, but…
when I approach the line.

16:56.799 --> 16:59.309
I always do this:

16:59.399 --> 17:01.629
"Ashes, ashes,

17:01.720 --> 17:04.950
we all fall down."

17:09.319 --> 17:11.069
That's it?

17:11.160 --> 17:14.589
I know it sounds ridiculous
but it relaxes me. You should try it.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.348
See, just start on your left foot, then go.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.789
Ashes, ashes.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.549
we all fall down.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.630
And then, after I release the ball.
I always do this:

17:25.720 --> 17:28.509
Please, please, please, please, please.

17:28.599 --> 17:32.470
Please, please,
please, please, please, please…

17:32.559 --> 17:35.230
- Pete!
- Yeah?

17:35.319 --> 17:37.700
You're embarrassing yourself.

17:37.799 --> 17:40.789
I am not, and you're always criticizing.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.750
This is neither the time nor the place.

17:43.839 --> 17:45.829
fine.

17:49.400 --> 17:53.430
Mrs Taylor. I'm terribly sorry
to hear about your mother.

17:53.519 --> 17:55.589
- What about my mother?
- Rock.

17:55.680 --> 18:00.509
ix-nay on-thay eft-thay
car-thay, please-ay.

18:00.599 --> 18:02.349
Enough said, Timmy.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.950
What are you talking about?

18:05.039 --> 18:07.670
- Rock and I were having a little fun.
- Oh, yeah?

18:07.759 --> 18:11.460
You want to have a little fun?
Why don't we make a bet?

18:11.559 --> 18:14.869
A bet? How about in the form
of public humiliation?

18:14.960 --> 18:17.190
We let people watch you bowl?

18:23.200 --> 18:27.069
No. I was thinking maybe…
the loser has to kiss the winner's…

18:27.160 --> 18:30.230
- What?
- ..bowling shoes.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.309
- Right here, in front of everybody.
- Oh, yeah!

18:38.400 --> 18:40.069
All right, you're on.

18:43.839 --> 18:47.230
- He's coming, he's coming.
- OK, Mark, hide over there.

18:47.319 --> 18:50.829
- Brad, you know what to do.
- I'm ready.

18:50.920 --> 18:54.829
Hey. I thought I told you boys
not to touch my machine.

18:54.920 --> 18:57.670
I've got news.
My brother's gonna get high score.

18:57.759 --> 19:01.509
I don't think so.
Get out of my way, maggot.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.390
- Now!
- What do you think you're…

19:04.480 --> 19:06.230
Get these cuﬀs oﬀ me!

19:06.319 --> 19:09.589
I'll break both of your faces.
You just come here. Come here.

19:09.680 --> 19:13.430
I don't think so.
Mark, ammo!

19:15.200 --> 19:17.470
You guys are dead meat. Dead…

19:21.119 --> 19:24.390
- Hey, stop it!
- Brad. I think you missed a spot.

19:27.079 --> 19:28.430
Strike!

19:28.519 --> 19:30.869
Great comeback!
Now you're only down by nine pins.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.519
This is the last frame.
Just do it, all right?

19:33.599 --> 19:36.430
Don't wanna make you nervous, Tim,
but this is the clutch shot.

19:36.519 --> 19:38.670
Kiss 'em all and you win, buddy.

19:38.759 --> 19:41.829
Yes.., yes…

19:44.200 --> 19:46.910
So, wait. What are you saying?
You're saying, that, like…

19:47.000 --> 19:48.990
unless he gets down every single pin -

19:49.079 --> 19:52.859
which is very hard to do
under all this pressure - I win?

19:52.960 --> 19:56.069
I think that's exactly
what he's saying, Jill.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.910
Ashes, ashes, all fall down.

20:09.519 --> 20:14.349
Hey! Ten pins down, all fall down.
Ten pins down. I get the crown.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.549
I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win!

20:16.640 --> 20:19.750
I win. I win. I win. I win. I win!

20:20.519 --> 20:22.630
Now, wait a minute, Tim.
I may be wrong.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.349
but doesn't that buzzer mean
that's some kind of foul?

20:25.440 --> 20:28.869
That means the game's over
or something.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.829
No, that's a foul.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.829
- That's only in tournament play.
- Your strike doesn't count.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.910
- You mean I won?
- No, it doesn't mean you won.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.829
- It does. She took you fair and square.
- Come on, guys, let's bowl.

20:39.920 --> 20:42.670
I believed in you, Tim Taylor.

20:42.759 --> 20:45.509
This is indeed a dark day.

20:46.359 --> 20:49.950
- I think Al could've taken her.
- Absolutely.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.309
I didn't beat you by that much.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.950
- Are you upset, Tim?
- No. I had a lot of fun, Jill.

20:59.039 --> 21:03.509
Well, that's good. That's good
cos there's one thing that you could do

21:03.599 --> 21:06.630
- that would really make me really happy.
- What?

21:06.720 --> 21:10.339
Well, you could take this old
score sheet and you could just

21:10.440 --> 21:12.349
have it laminated!

21:14.160 --> 21:16.539
I won. I won. I won!

21:16.640 --> 21:19.349
I beat you. I beat you. I beat you!

21:23.759 --> 21:27.380
You don't have to kiss 'em. You can
just nuzzle them next to your cheek

21:27.480 --> 21:31.259
and whisper,
"You're the best, Jill. You're the best"

21:36.279 --> 21:39.349
You're the best, Jill.
You're the best.

21:39.440 --> 21:43.029
This is the most perfect night of my life.
Nothing could ruin it.

21:43.119 --> 21:46.230
Excuse me, excuse me.
Are these your boys?

21:48.559 --> 21:51.829
- What did they do?
- They handcuﬀed a kid to a video game

21:51.920 --> 21:54.990
and they covered him with Silly String.

21:55.079 --> 21:57.150
- Oh, those aren't my boys.
- I've never seen them before in my life.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.390
Mom!

22:02.160 --> 22:05.150
Mom, you don't understand.
He had Brad in a headlock.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.430
- Yeah, he was messing up my hair.
- I don't care.

22:08.519 --> 22:10.589
You should've come to us first.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.750
Dad, you always said we should
stand up for ourselves.

22:13.839 --> 22:17.619
That's a good idea normally
but this time you got a big problem.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.230
That guy is free now.

22:20.319 --> 22:24.190
pretty angry, and still
a lot bigger than you guys.

22:24.880 --> 22:29.029
He's gonna destroy you guys.
This will be great!

22:29.119 --> 22:33.029
This is a darn good way of getting back
at people that humiliate you in public.

22:33.119 --> 22:36.109
- Don't even think about it, Tim.
- Nice draw.

22:36.200 --> 22:39.710
- You thought I was gonna spray you.
- Yes. I did. Now, put it down.

22:39.799 --> 22:44.390
- You put that down first.
- OK, we'll put it down together.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.269
- On the count of three.
- Your shoe's untied.

22:47.359 --> 22:49.230
I know.
