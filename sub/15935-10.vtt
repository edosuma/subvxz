JOHNSON: <i>Previously on</i> Masters of Sex...

00:15.498 --> 00:18.102
Can I tell you a secret, Allison?

00:18.103 --> 00:20.441
This person that I've always been...

00:20.442 --> 00:22.878
that person seems to be fading away.

00:22.879 --> 00:24.381
I'm gonna stay.

00:24.382 --> 00:27.221
Allison and her friends are
walking to the festival.

00:28.858 --> 00:32.262
We can make a fresh start,
the two of us, together.

00:32.264 --> 00:33.733
At our own clinic.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.704
Bill and Virginia

00:35.705 --> 00:39.479
might object to the number
of follow-up appointments.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.217
Nancy and I have an idea for a book.

00:42.218 --> 00:44.755
I'm confident we can work something out.

00:44.756 --> 00:45.758
I'm pregnant.

00:46.760 --> 00:47.928
Nance, this is...

You came for treatment?

00:56.514 --> 00:58.148
I'm so surprised

00:58.149 --> 01:02.190
that you got Mom to go along with this.

01:02.191 --> 01:03.727
She has no idea.

into the unknown...

Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

02:54.916 --> 02:57.621
I was dreaming that we
were at our wedding

02:57.622 --> 03:01.361
and Mr. Sammy Davis Jr. was singing.

03:01.362 --> 03:03.198
Hmm.

03:03.199 --> 03:04.469
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

03:09.513 --> 03:11.650
- Oops.
- Mm-hmm.

03:15.424 --> 03:17.528
I was thinking.

03:17.529 --> 03:21.201
We could do this at Hef's mansion.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.706
Oh, in the grotto. Underwater.

03:23.707 --> 03:25.677
Yes, our vows could be in bubbles.

03:25.678 --> 03:28.449
With all our guests naked
and in inner tubes.

03:28.450 --> 03:31.556
I did read about a bride once

03:31.557 --> 03:34.295
that appeared in a puff of smoke.

03:38.369 --> 03:42.544
Luckily, we have plenty of
time to sort out the details.

03:42.545 --> 03:44.949
But for now, I'm going to slip out

03:44.950 --> 03:47.386
before your kids wake up.

03:47.387 --> 03:49.792
Don't want them to see me like this.

03:49.793 --> 03:53.633
Yes. Yeah, it would be a bad
idea for you to surprise them.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.437
JOHNSON: Yes, and like a wedding,

03:55.438 --> 03:58.141
telling our kids takes planning.

03:58.142 --> 03:59.979
Not unlike telling my parents.

03:59.980 --> 04:01.916
You do remember you have
an intake with them

04:01.917 --> 04:02.951

- Helping me?

Putting my mind at ease?

04:15.143 --> 04:17.314
Thank you so much for doing it.

04:20.421 --> 04:22.223
What?

04:22.224 --> 04:24.795
Nothing.

04:24.796 --> 04:26.667
I'm happy.

04:36.453 --> 04:39.459
- Is that your car?
- No. My van!

04:40.761 --> 04:43.031
Got it from a guy named Patches

04:43.032 --> 04:46.338
who I met at the Jewish Community Center

04:46.339 --> 04:48.810
where the nuns were
giving out sandwiches.

04:48.811 --> 04:50.312
Of course.

04:50.313 --> 04:52.718
I know we tried to look
for you on the news,

04:52.719 --> 04:54.354
but with all the mud and rain...

04:54.355 --> 04:57.293
There is a reason people
my age aren't hippies.

04:57.294 --> 04:59.699
Not that I regret a single moment.

05:01.403 --> 05:04.073
Have you been, uh, staying here all week

05:04.074 --> 05:05.643
while Bill's been watching the kids?

05:05.644 --> 05:08.683
No. No, I just... I stayed
last night for dinner.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.587
Um, all the kids were together,

05:10.588 --> 05:12.356
and then George came to pick up Lisa.

05:12.357 --> 05:13.860
I meant to-to go home.

05:13.861 --> 05:15.463
It's okay, Gin,

05:35.671 --> 05:38.376
I'm glad. I really am.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.820
My only concern is the children,
that they'll be confused.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.657
Well, they don't know yet, obviously.

05:45.658 --> 05:48.061
I was actually hoping that you and I

05:48.062 --> 05:50.332
could figure that out together...

05:50.333 --> 05:51.903
how to tell them.

- The both of you.

06:26.105 --> 06:27.574
Who's your wedding planner?

06:27.575 --> 06:30.045
Wedding pl... no, I
think that Bill and I

06:30.046 --> 06:32.249
are at a point where we
don't really need...

06:32.250 --> 06:34.387
Oh, no, a wedding planner
is an absolute must.

06:34.388 --> 06:35.924
You cannot be pulling your hair out

06:35.925 --> 06:37.727
with a million niggly
details on the day.

06:37.728 --> 06:39.464
Then maybe you would like the job.

06:39.465 --> 06:42.637
And, Barton, we were hoping that
you would stand as our witness.

06:42.638 --> 06:45.142

gives us all hope.

you mind signing in?

07:05.551 --> 07:07.554

07:07.555 --> 07:09.458
What are we taking in exactly?

07:09.459 --> 07:11.762
I think he means a questionnaire.

07:11.763 --> 07:14.401
Let's have Bill explain what he means,

07:14.402 --> 07:16.371
rather than us guessing.

07:16.372 --> 07:18.308
Harry's right, essentially.

07:18.309 --> 07:20.947
<i>It is a questionnaire. An extensive one.</i>

07:20.948 --> 07:22.751
Asking about?

07:22.752 --> 07:24.120
A range of things...

07:24.121 --> 07:26.759
uh, childhood history, a sense of self,

07:26.760 --> 07:30.265
what sensual stimuli
can elicit a response.

07:30.266 --> 07:32.971
So we start with your current

You cannot be asking me
what I think you're asking.

08:01.730 --> 08:03.666
Well, Edna, we do separate you and Harry

08:03.667 --> 08:05.168
to answer these questions,

08:05.169 --> 08:07.239

11:45.276 --> 11:49.450
She's been in New York all week,
signing papers for office space.

11:49.451 --> 11:51.086
Not your space too?

11:51.087 --> 11:52.456
I find it hard to believe

11:52.457 --> 11:53.992
you're not beside her in all this.

11:53.993 --> 11:56.631
I was, but I'm not anymore.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.735
I've had to face some hard truths

11:58.736 --> 12:00.806
about myself and my marriage

12:00.807 --> 12:04.514
and who Nancy and I are... were...

12:04.515 --> 12:05.583
to each other.

12:05.584 --> 12:07.520
So your marriage is also ending.

12:07.521 --> 12:10.124
Well, this has been quite a morning.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.530
I'm sorry, Art.

12:12.531 --> 12:15.236
Of course. I'm-I'm sorry too.

12:17.975 --> 12:20.111
(SIGHS)

12:20.112 --> 12:21.982
You didn't deserve this.

12:21.983 --> 12:24.988
To have your work stolen
and your trust betrayed.

12:24.989 --> 12:27.927
So I just want to say I'm sorry.

12:27.928 --> 12:31.167
I'm hoping it's not too late.

12:32.437 --> 12:34.106
In a breach this serious,

12:34.107 --> 12:36.176
there are a series of steps
that must be enacted.

12:36.177 --> 12:37.980
And the first step should
be change all the locks,

12:37.981 --> 12:39.817
or I'm gonna go out there
and stand guard by myself.

12:39.818 --> 12:40.920
KELLER: Change the locks. Yes.

12:40.921 --> 12:42.355
Lester, you see to that.

12:42.356 --> 12:44.293
In the meantime, one
of us needs to search

12:44.294 --> 12:47.265
every inch of Nancy's office...
maybe she kept files or lists.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.602
KELLER: We'll also do
the same for her house,

12:48.603 --> 12:49.771
which will likely require
a search warrant,

12:49.772 --> 12:51.340
unless the husband will let us in.

12:51.341 --> 12:52.810
I'm sure Art would, but
he's already moved out.

12:52.811 --> 12:54.814
I cannot believe Nancy would do this.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.618
This is not the woman I know.

12:56.619 --> 12:58.789
Unfortunately, it's often
a trusted employee

12:58.790 --> 13:01.293
that's in the position
to do the most damage.

13:01.294 --> 13:03.832
Art mentioned that she's already
reached out to certain patients.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.769
So we'll call them back, make it clear

13:05.770 --> 13:08.442
if they've heard from Dr. Leveau
that she's under investigation.

13:08.443 --> 13:10.244
I'm happy to make those calls.

13:10.245 --> 13:11.815

13:11.816 --> 13:13.585
Yes. Bill, we'll need
to get to Drag quickly

there's going to be a book

13:15.289 --> 13:17.660
based on our work, it'll
come from us and us only.

facing legal action as well.

13:26.612 --> 13:29.016

13:29.017 --> 13:31.454

at the same time.

13:31.455 --> 13:33.459
The wedding? What wedding?

13:35.897 --> 13:39.704
Uh, well, this is hardly the
time to tell you, Lester,

13:39.705 --> 13:43.712

With... with me?

22:22.182 --> 22:23.985
It's the right thing to do.

22:25.354 --> 22:28.227
The right thing? For whom?

22:30.432 --> 22:31.700
JOHNNY: You don't have friends.

22:31.701 --> 22:33.738
You won't have Mom, and...

22:35.374 --> 22:37.912
if I leave,

22:37.913 --> 22:39.549
you'll have no one.

22:39.550 --> 22:41.887
You'll be all alone.

22:41.888 --> 22:44.427
So that's why you want to stay?

22:45.762 --> 22:48.734
No one, not even you, deserves

22:48.735 --> 22:50.539
to be alone like that.

23:05.402 --> 23:07.773
Well, you should know...

23:10.178 --> 23:11.613
that I'm not gonna be alone.

23:11.614 --> 23:13.552
I do have someone.

23:15.021 --> 23:17.926
Virginia.

23:17.927 --> 23:19.963
Aunt Gini?

23:19.964 --> 23:21.700
What do you mean?

23:21.701 --> 23:26.109
I mean we're-we're together. In love.

23:27.479 --> 23:30.083
We're, uh... we're gonna get married.

23:30.084 --> 23:32.956
Look, I know that must
seem strange to you,

23:32.957 --> 23:35.628
given all the years that Aunt Virginia

23:35.629 --> 23:37.164
has been a part of our family

23:37.165 --> 23:38.801
and how close you've been to Tessa.

23:38.802 --> 23:41.741
This whole time,
you've-you've loved her?

23:42.810 --> 23:44.178
I did.

23:44.179 --> 23:45.681
How could you do that?

23:45.682 --> 23:47.485
Look, what you have
to understand is that

23:47.486 --> 23:49.689
the last thing I wanted
was to hurt your mother.

23:49.690 --> 23:51.693
But you did. Why?

23:51.694 --> 23:56.436
Because grown-up lives are
just impossibly complicated.

23:56.437 --> 23:59.876
Because I loved Virginia,
and as much as I tried,

23:59.877 --> 24:01.980
I just couldn't change that feeling.

24:01.981 --> 24:04.986
Well, then you-you weren't
trying hard enough.

24:04.987 --> 24:06.657
I was, John.

24:06.658 --> 24:08.293
Look, I'm... look, I'm not
saying I'm blameless.

24:08.294 --> 24:09.328
It's far from it.

24:09.329 --> 24:11.900
I have made many mistakes,

24:11.901 --> 24:14.339
but that doesn't mean
there isn't love in it.

24:15.341 --> 24:16.910
I love you...

24:16.911 --> 24:18.514
and Jenny and Howie.

24:18.515 --> 24:22.522
And I did love your mother. I still do.

24:22.523 --> 24:26.431
But not in that way.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.772
No. No, that way...

24:32.476 --> 24:35.448
that's how I love Virginia.

24:35.449 --> 24:38.854
So the good news is, you
don't have to stay here

24:38.855 --> 24:41.393
because you're worried about me.

24:42.395 --> 24:45.166
I won't, then.

24:45.167 --> 24:49.008
Mom will really need my help
if we're moving so far away.

24:51.547 --> 24:53.217
You know, John...

24:57.893 --> 25:01.833
you don't have to feel so
responsible for adults.

25:01.834 --> 25:05.007
Let them figure out their
problems for themselves.

25:06.844 --> 25:09.182
You can just be a boy.

25:12.388 --> 25:13.525
No.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.363
I really can't.

25:30.357 --> 25:31.526
(GROANS)

25:31.527 --> 25:33.329
I've been looking everywhere for you.

25:33.330 --> 25:37.872

limes, and cherries...

25:37.873 --> 25:39.843

25:39.844 --> 25:41.447
It's practically a health drink.

25:42.883 --> 25:45.788
Is Daddy upstairs in the room?

25:45.789 --> 25:47.090
No, he's off somewhere,

25:47.091 --> 25:49.863
planning his new life
as an old bachelor.

25:49.864 --> 25:53.035
Mom, I'm-I'm so sorry.

25:53.036 --> 25:57.645
- I can't imagine...
- What a relief it is?

25:57.646 --> 25:59.147
You don't mean that.

25:59.148 --> 26:01.419
No one understands their parents.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.524
Doesn't matter what age they are.

26:03.525 --> 26:06.997
They always look at them from
the point of view of a child.

26:06.998 --> 26:08.433
Look, I understand that you're upset,

26:08.434 --> 26:10.203
and I am here to support you,

26:10.204 --> 26:13.777
and yes, you and Daddy,
you had a bad day,

26:13.778 --> 26:16.616
but that doesn't
necessarily mean the end.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.386
The one thing that your father and I

26:18.387 --> 26:21.726
do agree on at the
moment is our bafflement

26:21.727 --> 26:25.200
over why you are so determined
to keep us together.

26:27.238 --> 26:29.943
Fine. You want to know one reason?

26:29.944 --> 26:31.746
Bill and I are getting married.

26:31.747 --> 26:33.717
We want to have the ceremony next month.

26:33.718 --> 26:37.324
Now, obviously, we'd like
you and Daddy to be there.

26:37.325 --> 26:39.629
Maybe both of you can
walk me down the aisle.

26:39.630 --> 26:41.633
Apparently, that's in fashion lately,

26:41.634 --> 26:45.641
according to Guy, my wedding planner.

26:45.642 --> 26:47.143
That's a mistake, honey.

26:47.144 --> 26:49.582
He says everybody has a
wedding planner now.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.419
I meant getting married.

26:51.420 --> 26:54.257
For decades, I have tended
to your father's needs,

26:54.258 --> 26:57.765
and the truth is, I am done with sex.

26:57.766 --> 26:59.869
I have been for years.

26:59.870 --> 27:03.109
The thought that I can
now crawl into bed

27:03.110 --> 27:05.914
without being poked and pawed...

27:05.915 --> 27:09.989
just me, alone, with a book, in peace...

27:09.990 --> 27:12.127
This from the woman that told me

27:12.128 --> 27:14.131
to "nail Bill down,"

27:14.132 --> 27:16.001
I believe were your words.

27:16.002 --> 27:18.473
I was speaking from fear,
which I no longer have.

27:18.474 --> 27:20.911
- Oh.
- And really, Virginia.

27:20.912 --> 27:24.184
Given your age and all
you've been through,

27:24.185 --> 27:28.126
do you really need another
failed marriage on your ledger?

27:32.502 --> 27:36.041
Forty years tossed on the trash heap.

27:36.042 --> 27:38.013
And she was happy.

27:39.182 --> 27:40.984
Or drunk.

27:40.985 --> 27:43.355
I wouldn't take anything she
said tonight as gospel.

27:43.356 --> 27:45.961
Oh, you didn't hear her.

27:45.962 --> 27:48.065
You know, between imagining

27:48.066 --> 27:51.506
my parents at the wedding

27:51.507 --> 27:54.211
and cleaning up the mess
that Nancy left behind,

27:54.212 --> 27:56.649
maybe we should push the
wedding down the road a bit...

27:56.650 --> 27:58.252
six months...

27:58.253 --> 28:02.160
when planning it doesn't
feel so overwhelming.

28:02.161 --> 28:04.097
Then let's not plan.

28:04.098 --> 28:05.968
Let's do it tomorrow.

28:05.969 --> 28:07.471
I'm serious.

28:07.472 --> 28:10.511
Just us. Not tell a soul.

28:10.512 --> 28:13.315
- No, we can't do it that way.
- Why not?

28:13.316 --> 28:18.325
Because it's as if we have
walked across broken glass,

28:18.326 --> 28:21.466
barefoot, for years,
to get to this point.

28:21.467 --> 28:24.070
We-we have to celebrate
after all that...

28:24.071 --> 28:28.481
We only have to do what we want.

28:30.985 --> 28:32.588
Look around us, Virginia.

28:32.589 --> 28:35.159
My-my kids are moving
halfway across the country.

28:35.160 --> 28:38.332
Your parents' marriage is falling apart.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.236
People we trusted have betrayed us.

28:40.237 --> 28:43.375
What do we really have
but for each other?

28:43.376 --> 28:44.946
Of course we have each other, but...

28:44.947 --> 28:48.252
So why shouldn't our
marriage reflect that?

28:48.253 --> 28:51.225
Because our marriage

28:51.226 --> 28:55.132
is something bigger than that.

28:55.133 --> 28:58.707
Everything that we've
dedicated ourselves to,

28:58.708 --> 29:01.713
everything that we've believed in,

29:01.714 --> 29:05.587
has all come true for the
couple that started it all.

29:05.588 --> 29:08.225
That'll be so inspiring to people.

29:08.226 --> 29:10.063
I don't... I don't care about people.

29:11.567 --> 29:14.371
We are getting married.
Bill and Virginia.

29:14.372 --> 29:18.613
Not Masters and Johnson,
the famous sex therapists.

29:18.614 --> 29:21.351
If we don't learn to separate
ourselves from that...

29:21.352 --> 29:23.022
No, of course. I want that too.

29:23.023 --> 29:24.892
I-I want to keep that sacred.

29:24.893 --> 29:27.598
Doesn't it say everything
about who we are now,

29:27.599 --> 29:30.036
who we want to be in the future,

29:30.037 --> 29:32.775
if we just push aside
all the distractions

29:32.776 --> 29:36.950
and stand before a clerk,
in the eyes of God,

29:36.951 --> 29:40.824
and make this about us?

29:40.825 --> 29:44.833
Just you and me. Nobody else.

29:48.474 --> 29:51.244
Well, not even Barton?

29:51.245 --> 29:52.848
We still need a witness.

29:52.849 --> 29:54.652
All right, Barton can still witness,

love with a child,

31:20.390 --> 31:22.427
It's not like Barton to tattle.

31:22.428 --> 31:24.865
He didn't. I heard you on the tape.

So you eavesdropped.

31:26.970 --> 31:29.475
You really are turning over a new leaf.

What kind of mother would I be?

31:55.461 --> 31:58.032
Like Virginia? God forbid, maybe worse?

31:59.669 --> 32:01.940
I could've loved a child
for the both of us.

32:03.644 --> 32:06.281
New York can still be
a fresh start for us.

32:06.282 --> 32:08.051
Maybe you can convince me I wouldn't be

32:08.052 --> 32:10.156
such a bad mother after all.

32:11.627 --> 32:15.165
Oh, God. I don't want this, Art.

32:15.166 --> 32:17.438
I'm a shrink, Nance.

32:19.643 --> 32:23.115
You confessed the one thing you
knew would end our marriage

32:23.116 --> 32:25.688
in a room you knew was being taped.

32:27.925 --> 32:30.296
Sometimes what we want

32:30.297 --> 32:32.000
can surprise even us.

32:46.563 --> 32:48.365
I assumed you called me in

32:48.366 --> 32:50.570
because of my last session with Cherlyn,

32:50.571 --> 32:52.173
which was very successful.

32:52.174 --> 32:53.976
This isn't about your last session.

32:53.977 --> 32:55.847
Or your time here as a patient.

32:55.848 --> 32:58.051
This is about your work
with us as our publisher.

32:58.052 --> 33:00.055
Our relationship to Little, Brown.

33:00.056 --> 33:02.527
Which we assumed was an
exclusive relationship,

33:02.528 --> 33:05.099
in that we've given you the
rights to all our work.

33:05.100 --> 33:08.205
And in entrusting our work to you,

33:08.206 --> 33:12.514
we assumed it would engender
a loyalty between us,

33:12.515 --> 33:14.050
one that went both ways.

33:14.051 --> 33:16.555
Of course it does. Both ways.

33:16.556 --> 33:20.028
Then there's something you
have to explain to us, Bob.

33:20.029 --> 33:22.667
Why is it that you've agreed
to do a book on homosexuality

33:22.668 --> 33:24.071
with Art and Nancy?

33:25.073 --> 33:28.079
Did they say that?

33:30.484 --> 33:31.986
How perfectly indiscreet.

33:31.987 --> 33:35.894
We are both your clients
and your doctors, Bob,

33:35.895 --> 33:38.766
and since we're the ones
that agreed to treat you...

33:38.767 --> 33:40.403
Essentially cured you

33:40.404 --> 33:42.541
so you could have a future with Cherlyn.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.578
Although Art did put in the work.

33:44.579 --> 33:46.214
I mean, day-to-day.

33:46.215 --> 33:49.788
Art is not a known entity

33:49.789 --> 33:50.957

33:52.929 --> 33:54.431

of homosexuals.

I said what was needed
to get the book back.

34:45.734 --> 34:47.469
So we'll give him a few days,

34:47.471 --> 34:49.641
and then I'll check in with
Ketterman at Little, Brown,

34:49.641 --> 34:51.446
make sure Bob kept his promise.

34:53.684 --> 34:56.455
I should get home.

34:56.456 --> 34:57.825
Get changed.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.271
Marriage license?

35:05.774 --> 35:07.377
Safe and sound.

35:09.415 --> 35:11.284
We should probably just meet there

35:11.285 --> 35:13.221
instead of you picking me up.

35:13.222 --> 35:16.127
Oh, you don't want me to see
you before the ceremony?

35:16.128 --> 35:18.432
It's bad luck.

35:18.433 --> 35:20.770
I saw my other husbands
before those weddings,

35:20.771 --> 35:23.241
and this one is going to be different.

35:23.242 --> 35:24.343
Mm-hmm.

35:24.344 --> 35:25.847
(DOOR OPENS)

35:25.848 --> 35:28.452
Oh. So sorry, lovebirds.

35:28.453 --> 35:30.923
But I just got off the
phone with Hef's office,

35:30.924 --> 35:32.694
and good news.

35:32.695 --> 35:36.468
He has generously offered up
his mansion for your wedding.

35:36.469 --> 35:38.104
Apparently, Soupy Sales
got married there,

35:38.105 --> 35:40.308
and they released a dozen
white doves into the air

35:40.309 --> 35:42.447
when he kissed his bride.

35:42.448 --> 35:45.887
Why don't we just put a pin
in this for a moment, Guy?

35:45.888 --> 35:50.897
Yeah, Virginia and I are
discussing a smaller affair.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.302
Well, not too small for doves, I hope.

35:54.739 --> 35:56.809
We can still consider doves.

35:56.810 --> 35:58.244
Let's just talk about it tomorrow.

35:58.245 --> 35:59.981
I'll be here.

35:59.982 --> 36:01.586
With bells on.

36:04.124 --> 36:07.430
- He's going to be crushed.
- Mm-hmm.

36:07.431 --> 36:09.969
Maybe I can give him my bouquet.

36:15.514 --> 36:17.015
Dr. Dreessen, you're here.

36:17.016 --> 36:18.719
I wasn't sure you'd get my message.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.190
Well, you made it sound important, so...

36:21.191 --> 36:22.628
Yes, it is.

36:23.663 --> 36:25.566
So...

36:25.567 --> 36:27.002
can I buy you a drink?

36:27.003 --> 36:29.574
I don't think so, no, but thank you.

36:29.575 --> 36:33.416
Okay. You mind if I keep drinking?

36:35.319 --> 36:37.490
All right. Well. (CLEARS THROAT)

36:37.491 --> 36:39.594
As is always the way with these things,

36:39.595 --> 36:43.702
nothing is ever easy... in
life, in love, in business...

36:43.703 --> 36:45.907
You're going to do the
homosexuality book

36:45.908 --> 36:48.044
with Bill and Virginia.

36:48.045 --> 36:51.083
Boy, can you ever read me.

36:51.084 --> 36:54.056
Look, I know I promised
the book to you, and...

36:54.057 --> 36:56.394
You should do the book with them.

36:56.395 --> 36:57.964
I'm moving on.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.901
I'm leaving this work
and the clinic behind.

36:59.902 --> 37:04.143
I'm very sad to hear that.

37:04.144 --> 37:07.417
You're such a gifted doctor.
Dedicated...

37:07.418 --> 37:09.654
I would say the credit is all yours.

37:09.655 --> 37:11.592
Yours and Cherlyn's.

37:11.593 --> 37:14.029
Cherlyn is happy, of course.

37:14.030 --> 37:17.670
Not that she's ever entirely
pleased with anything.

37:17.671 --> 37:19.875
But you know how that goes with women.

37:19.876 --> 37:23.717
I understand you and Nancy
are having difficulties.

37:25.587 --> 37:27.690
Well, it's...

37:27.691 --> 37:30.597
it's not so difficult
once it's finally over.

37:31.466 --> 37:33.301
Ah.

37:33.302 --> 37:37.710
Well, that wife of yours...
tough stuff, huh?

37:37.711 --> 37:39.648
I noticed it in the office.

37:39.649 --> 37:43.121
A beauty, surely, but also a certain

37:43.122 --> 37:45.058
way of the executioner about her...

37:45.059 --> 37:47.262
I'd rather not talk about Nancy.

37:47.263 --> 37:48.966
The wounds are still fresh.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.905
Ugh, I know those wounds.

37:51.906 --> 37:56.815
What I'm saying is, we
understand each other, Art.

37:56.816 --> 38:01.826
And I am so very sorry.

38:03.430 --> 38:05.298
Um...

38:05.299 --> 38:07.036
excuse me for a moment.

38:16.622 --> 38:18.492
Jesus, Bob.

38:18.493 --> 38:19.795
You startled me.

38:27.845 --> 38:30.917
I'm afraid I am tipsy.

38:33.188 --> 38:35.593
I'm afraid it's more than that.

38:35.594 --> 38:37.295
LIBBY: Of course I was
gonna tell you, Bram.

38:37.296 --> 38:39.299
There's just been a million
details to attend to.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.337
I don't even rank as a
last-minute detail?

38:41.338 --> 38:43.876
No, it's just been such
a whirlwind is all.

38:43.877 --> 38:46.047
One minute, I'm sitting
there in the mud,

38:46.048 --> 38:47.717
talking to Dr. Phillips, and then...

38:47.718 --> 38:50.321
God, why did I let you
go to this concert?

38:50.322 --> 38:52.827
All that came from that debacle was VD,

38:52.828 --> 38:55.231
a field full of cows that won't milk,

38:55.232 --> 38:57.135
and you moving 2,000 miles away.

38:57.136 --> 38:59.306
To go to law school.

38:59.307 --> 39:01.077
I thought you would be proud of me.

39:01.078 --> 39:02.379
I am proud of you.

39:02.380 --> 39:04.617
I also love you, so I'm just wondering

39:04.618 --> 39:07.355
how we're gonna continue
seeing each other.

39:07.356 --> 39:08.759
I don't know.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.328
What do you mean, you don't know?

39:10.329 --> 39:12.332
So what are you saying?
That's it? We're done?

39:12.333 --> 39:14.303
I'm not really saying anything.

39:14.304 --> 39:15.973
Why do we have to define it?

39:15.974 --> 39:18.211
Why do you have to sound like a
damn hippie all of a sudden?

39:18.212 --> 39:20.048
I'm just trying to be realistic.

39:20.049 --> 39:23.889
If we find our way to each other, great.

39:23.890 --> 39:28.131
If we don't, it wasn't meant to be.

39:28.132 --> 39:32.006
We have had a wonderful time together.

39:36.983 --> 39:39.487
No. I can't let you go like this.

39:39.488 --> 39:44.497
Oh. Here is the beauty
of the situation, Bram.

39:44.498 --> 39:48.405
It's not up to you whether I stay or go.

39:48.406 --> 39:51.444
The days of me organizing
my life around a man

39:51.445 --> 39:53.749
are over.

39:53.750 --> 39:57.355
Then I'll organize my life around yours.

39:57.356 --> 40:00.863
Unless you can stand there
and honestly tell me

40:00.864 --> 40:03.436
you don't love me.

40:06.409 --> 40:11.116
I would say the evidence
points to my loving you.

40:11.117 --> 40:13.589
Then the defense rests.

40:13.590 --> 40:15.091
For the time being only.

40:15.092 --> 40:18.899
You go and do what you need to do.

40:18.900 --> 40:22.138
But one day, you will look up

40:22.139 --> 40:25.412
from your disgusting tempeh burger,

40:25.413 --> 40:28.184
and I will be there.

40:28.185 --> 40:32.192
The man who upended his
whole life for you.

Ms. Virginia, you have a phone call.

40:40.944 --> 40:42.480
I really need to get home, Guy.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.852
- Take a message.
- It sounds important.

40:47.323 --> 40:49.159
VIRGINIA: <i>I'm surprised
to hear from you so soon.</i>

40:49.160 --> 40:50.829
Well, I'm surprised to be calling,

40:50.830 --> 40:52.967
but I wanted to tell you one
last thing before I go.

40:52.968 --> 40:55.806
Oh, no. Is the damage from
Nancy worse than we thought?

40:55.807 --> 40:58.377
Bob Drag just kissed me in a men's room.

40:58.378 --> 40:59.647
He what?

40:59.648 --> 41:01.250
<i>Kissed me in a men's room.</i>

41:01.251 --> 41:03.422
He <i>kissed you,</i> kissed you?

41:06.796 --> 41:08.297
as a doctor and psychiatrist

41:08.298 --> 41:10.335
that Bob is an active homosexual,

41:22.293 --> 41:25.298

Oh. Mrs. Johnson.

41:59.802 --> 42:02.205
You're Billy's partner.

42:02.206 --> 42:03.975
I recognized you from your book.

42:03.976 --> 42:05.044
Ah.

42:05.045 --> 42:07.483
Anyway, have a good day.

42:07.484 --> 42:09.888
I will. Thank you.

42:16.502 --> 42:17.771
How do I look?

42:18.840 --> 42:20.175
Sharp as a tack.

42:21.512 --> 42:23.014
Are you going someplace special?

42:24.283 --> 42:26.019
Nope.

42:26.020 --> 42:30.061
Just home. You know. Eventually.

42:30.062 --> 42:33.400
Good, because Dody's here to see you.

42:33.401 --> 42:35.772
I'm pretty sure she
said her name was Dody.

42:35.773 --> 42:38.111
I'm definitely sure she said
she's someone from way back.

42:42.754 --> 42:45.893
DODY: I don't know if you
remember my cousin Delia.

42:45.894 --> 42:47.161
Oh, I don't know.

42:47.162 --> 42:51.136
Uh, dark hair? Had a
very high-pitched...

42:51.137 --> 42:53.475
- Laugh? Yes.
- Yeah.

42:53.476 --> 42:55.244
But a heart of gold.

42:55.245 --> 42:58.083
Anyway, so she just recently
moved to Chesterville,

42:58.084 --> 43:00.288
so I'm staying with her now.

43:00.289 --> 43:01.824
In Chesterville.

43:01.825 --> 43:04.129
- Just right outside...
- St. Louis.

43:04.130 --> 43:07.268
- Yes. About ten...
- Ten minutes.

43:07.269 --> 43:10.374
Oh, Bill, you don't have
to look so worried.

43:10.375 --> 43:12.813
I'm here because...

43:12.814 --> 43:15.719
well, I'm embarrassed about
the last time we met.

43:15.720 --> 43:18.157
Oh. Dody, no. You don't have to...

43:18.158 --> 43:20.394
No, no, I do.

43:20.395 --> 43:25.071
There's nothing worse
than a weepy woman,

43:25.072 --> 43:29.847
and yet seeing you
really did upend things.

43:29.848 --> 43:33.287
- My marriage, for starters.
- Oh, no.

43:33.288 --> 43:36.694
- No, I would never...
- And you can't blame yourself.

43:36.695 --> 43:39.700
It had to happen.

43:39.701 --> 43:44.443
I've been living like a visitor
in my own life for so long.

43:44.444 --> 43:47.650
But seeing each other

43:47.651 --> 43:52.559
also clarified for me another truth...

43:52.560 --> 43:55.966
that it was really always the two of us

43:55.967 --> 43:57.637
that were meant to be together.

44:02.981 --> 44:04.116
I'm, uh...

44:07.122 --> 44:09.093
I'm-I'm getting married.

44:10.496 --> 44:11.831
Oh.

44:11.832 --> 44:15.304
- Today.
- Oh, my goodness.

44:15.305 --> 44:17.676
- To...
- To Virginia.

44:17.677 --> 44:19.447
Virginia? Oh, Johnson.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.884
- Mm.
- Mrs. Johnson.

44:21.885 --> 44:23.955
Oh, I just saw her at the elevator.

44:23.956 --> 44:26.293
You did? You introduced yourself?

44:26.294 --> 44:28.163
Oh, no. No, no.

44:28.164 --> 44:29.867
But I would love to meet her.

44:29.868 --> 44:32.138
I mean, if I'm staying in the area.

44:32.139 --> 44:37.048
Well, perhaps, uh, you know,
someday in the future.

44:37.049 --> 44:40.020
That would be nice.

44:40.021 --> 44:42.726
It would settle things,

44:42.727 --> 44:45.432
once and for all,

44:45.433 --> 44:48.572
to see you happy with someone else.

44:54.216 --> 44:58.558
No one actually knows that
I'm getting married today

44:58.559 --> 45:01.129
except for my old friend Barton.

45:01.130 --> 45:03.601
And now you.

45:03.602 --> 45:06.575
The person I've known
even longer than that.

45:09.748 --> 45:11.984
Wouldn't it be something

45:11.985 --> 45:15.191
if we ended up as friends?

45:15.192 --> 45:17.497
Dody, we already are.

45:29.119 --> 45:30.622
I haven't returned your calls

45:30.623 --> 45:32.626
because I wanted to
speak to you in person.

45:32.627 --> 45:35.130
Lurking in the parking
lot doesn't bode well.

45:35.131 --> 45:37.803
I'm hoping you can say something
to make sense of all this.

45:37.804 --> 45:39.305
Well, you have to know

45:39.306 --> 45:41.276
you're the last person I wanted to hurt.

45:41.277 --> 45:42.479
Just me you're worried about?

45:42.480 --> 45:44.048
What about Art? What about the people

45:44.049 --> 45:45.719
who trusted you enough to hire you?

45:45.720 --> 45:47.255
You know as well as I do

45:47.256 --> 45:49.560
the world of sexual
therapy is exploding.

45:49.561 --> 45:51.062
It's changing by the minute.

45:51.063 --> 45:53.267
Bill and Virginia are trying
to hold on to something

45:53.268 --> 45:54.803
that is already slipping
from their grasp.

45:54.804 --> 45:56.339
That's absurd.

45:56.340 --> 45:58.343
And it won't work, what
you're trying to do.

45:58.344 --> 45:59.813
Of course it will.

45:59.814 --> 46:01.617
I will simply build
on what they started.

46:01.618 --> 46:03.755
Copernicus discovered the Sun
was the center of the universe.

46:03.756 --> 46:05.792
Then Galileo pushed it further.
So did Hubble.

46:05.793 --> 46:08.263
Now Neil Armstrong is
walking on the moon.

46:08.264 --> 46:11.269
I will take their work places
they can only imagine.

46:11.270 --> 46:14.208
They're the top sex
experts in the country,

46:14.209 --> 46:16.279
with years of cutting-edge work ahead.

46:16.280 --> 46:19.920
I'm not saying they won't continue.

46:19.921 --> 46:21.389
You know Virginia better than I.

46:21.390 --> 46:24.563
Her unbridled ambition, her
craving for acclaim...

46:24.564 --> 46:26.968
She is pushing the work,
pushing Bill, even,

46:26.969 --> 46:28.270
into an area now

back from Art and Nancy

48:14.016 --> 48:15.250

It turns out he was able to, uh,

48:20.261 --> 48:22.499
redirect his homosexual impulses

48:22.500 --> 48:24.836
towards his heterosexual
relationship, but...

nothing like the torture

48:52.325 --> 48:54.429
so successfully with
heterosexual couples

48:54.430 --> 48:58.303
and just directed it towards Drag,

48:58.304 --> 49:00.108
to see if it could help.

49:01.310 --> 49:03.179
He begged me, Barton,

49:03.180 --> 49:06.019

as his doctor to help him

49:22.319 --> 49:25.123

this conversion work.

- What?
- Because I'm fond of her, Bill.

49:28.164 --> 49:29.499
I always have been.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.069
But I've also seen over the years

49:31.070 --> 49:33.139
how Virginia has the most to prove,

49:33.140 --> 49:36.447
how hard she fights to advance
her place in the work.

49:36.448 --> 49:38.283
Maybe because she's uncredentialed.

49:38.284 --> 49:39.786

49:39.787 --> 49:42.157
You and I can sort out our
differences on conversion,

49:42.158 --> 49:43.928

Oh, you can't abide it.

Well, I can't have you speak
like this about Virginia.

49:50.341 --> 49:52.144
Then you better head to City Hall alone,
