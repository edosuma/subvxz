01:19.870 --> 01:23.989
'It seems to me,
gazing back across the decades,

01:23.990 --> 01:29.069
'that my journey into womanhood
began on the streets of East London

01:29.070 --> 01:33.188
'working as a midwife in the
city's poorest quarter.

01:33.189 --> 01:36.388
'I never knew an idle day,
a misspent hour,

01:36.389 --> 01:39.469
'a single moment without some
sense of purpose.

01:40.709 --> 01:44.308
'I could be bone tired
and I would rally exhausted

01:44.309 --> 01:46.429
'and bounce back time and again.'

01:54.058 --> 01:55.757
Many happy returns, Jenny!

01:55.827 --> 01:57.467
Thank you.

02:03.706 --> 02:08.865
'Life was fuelled by learning,
but there was laughter too

02:08.866 --> 02:14.265
'and I was forging friendships
that would last me all my days.'

02:14.266 --> 02:17.943
Stop! I've got something in my shoe!
Oh, Cynthia, do hurry up!

02:17.944 --> 02:20.703
The bus won't wait,
and neither will Rossano Brazzi.

02:20.704 --> 02:23.303
Never mind Rossano Brazzi,
there's Chummy!

02:23.304 --> 02:26.725
Sorry. Sorry! Sackcloth and ashes!
Evening, ladies.

02:26.748 --> 02:27.986
Hello, Peter!

02:27.989 --> 02:31.226
I just got into the most atrocious
fix with a steamed sponge pudding!

02:31.227 --> 02:33.506
One has to constantly top up
the pan with water,

02:33.507 --> 02:35.186
or else the tin will just... explode.

02:35.187 --> 02:37.946
There's no harm done, Camilla.
Go and enjoy the film.

02:37.947 --> 02:40.308
I can still see
bits of syrup on the braid!

02:46.867 --> 02:52.066
'We strove to serve women,
living alongside and amongst them.

02:52.067 --> 02:57.026
'Men were creatures that you
married, or marvelled at,

02:57.027 --> 03:01.105
'or yearned for,
or found somehow perplexing.

03:01.106 --> 03:06.386
'Mainly, they made work for us,
and we knew no rest.'

03:21.025 --> 03:23.185
All hands on deck!

03:25.505 --> 03:28.182
Sister Julienne has already
gone to Mrs Hall.

03:28.183 --> 03:30.582
Her waters broke
a week before the due date.

03:30.583 --> 03:33.222
Clinic starts 2.00 sharp,
this afternoon.

03:33.223 --> 03:36.344
In the meantime, Sister Bernadette,
you will man the phone.

03:36.420 --> 03:37.538
Yes, Sister.

03:37.553 --> 03:40.471
Nurses Lee and Noakes,
you can take the booking-in list.

03:40.472 --> 03:43.830
Yes, Sister. Nurse Miller, I think
we should add in Mrs Mournsey

03:43.831 --> 03:46.592
to the morning calls.
The baby's refused the breast again,

03:46.593 --> 03:50.591
and we should check him
for tongue-tie. Yes, Sister.

03:51.163 --> 03:52.882
Oh dear, have we started?

03:52.883 --> 03:55.561
These kirby grips have got
a mind of their own this morning.

03:55.562 --> 03:57.920
Where would we be without
Nurse Franklin,

03:57.921 --> 04:00.560
bringing up the rear
like a poodle at the circus?

04:00.561 --> 04:02.622
Mafeking Buildings are all yours.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.048
Single-handed? Hmm.

04:04.049 --> 04:06.449
But there's been 18 births
there this month alone!

04:06.450 --> 04:08.208
Hark at the oracle!

04:08.209 --> 04:11.688
Maybe you can ask them, while you're
there, if they know what causes it.

04:12.688 --> 04:14.887
But, Sister, from experience...

04:14.888 --> 04:16.487
Experience?

04:16.488 --> 04:19.086
If you had more experience
and less confidence,

04:19.087 --> 04:21.366
I might be
inclined to listen to you.

04:21.367 --> 04:24.408
Mafeking Buildings,
and that's final. Yes, Sister.

04:26.607 --> 04:29.245
You'll just have to
keep your head down, Trixie.

04:29.246 --> 04:31.805
Sister will have forgotten
all about it by the end of the day.

04:31.806 --> 04:34.405
You might get a supplementary
lecture during clinic.

04:34.406 --> 04:36.685
I got "needing to learn some
respect" the other day.

04:36.686 --> 04:39.884
What Sister Evangelina needs to learn
is that respect goes both ways!

04:39.885 --> 04:42.204
And you can hold your horses,
young Trixie.

04:42.205 --> 04:45.684
I have never known a chain drink
as much oil as yours.

04:45.685 --> 04:49.246
We don't want you coming off
and incurring further wrath, do we?

04:49.247 --> 04:54.204
No. And you can ignore all that
stuff about experience.

04:54.205 --> 04:58.564
What she says deep down,
is a load of hot air.

04:58.565 --> 05:01.085
Trouble is, Fred,
deep down I know it isn't.

05:09.204 --> 05:11.004
Heavy boy. Little butterball.

05:15.004 --> 05:16.324
Off you go.

05:27.483 --> 05:31.922
Mrs Collins?
You've forgotten something.

05:31.923 --> 05:34.603
Oh well,
plenty more like her at home.

05:35.883 --> 05:38.482
Mrs Brignall?

05:40.442 --> 05:42.761
Molly Brignall?

05:42.762 --> 05:45.881
Nitrous oxide,
also known as gas and air,

05:45.882 --> 05:48.080
is a wonderful method of
pain relief.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.600
Is it the same as that pethidine?

05:49.601 --> 05:51.439
In my view, it's much better.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.759
We'll be offering nitrous oxide
in the new maternity home.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.159
I want to stay in me own home!
You've got a car.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.161
Why can't you bring it in your boot?
I suppose in theory I could.

06:00.162 --> 06:03.160
Doctor only comes out
in complicated cases!

06:03.161 --> 06:04.558
Now, if Doctor's agreeable,

06:04.559 --> 06:07.558
we'll have a little demonstration
of how this apparatus works.

06:07.559 --> 06:10.598
Thank you, Nurse. Er,
perhaps you'd climb onto the couch.

06:10.599 --> 06:14.438
It's perfectly safe to inhale
the gas when you're lying down,

06:14.439 --> 06:17.278
as of course you will be
when you're in labour.

06:17.279 --> 06:18.877
Nurse Noakes, if you'd take over.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.317
This form of pain relief
really is top-hole.

06:21.318 --> 06:23.677
The midwife will turn it on
and off for you,

06:23.678 --> 06:26.637
but rule number one is you
start to breathe the gas

06:26.638 --> 06:29.959
before the contraction
really gets its boots on.

06:29.960 --> 06:34.677
Thus, the pain begins.
I indicate this to my attendant.

06:34.678 --> 06:38.198
The gas is activated.
I breathe in and out.

06:43.758 --> 06:47.835
As Nurse is saying, you then simply
breathe deeply and evenly

06:47.836 --> 06:49.757
until the contraction passes.

06:49.758 --> 06:52.556
It reduces the pain,
and gives a hazy,

06:52.557 --> 06:55.435
relaxed feeling that many
describe as being rather pleasant.

06:55.436 --> 06:58.155
What if you take an overdose?
It's not possible.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.995
Nurse remains in charge,
and after the contraction,

07:00.996 --> 07:03.836
a few breaths of ordinary air
will bring you round.

07:03.837 --> 07:05.356
Nurse.

07:06.596 --> 07:09.196
Nurse?
You can let go of the mask now.

07:14.436 --> 07:17.994
All in all,
a thoroughly pleasant sensation.

07:17.995 --> 07:20.794
I'll have one of them.

07:20.795 --> 07:24.594
I don't hold with all this gas
and air malarkey.

07:24.595 --> 07:27.873
It's downright cruel,
showing a woman pain relief

07:27.874 --> 07:29.553
when you can't give it to her.

07:29.554 --> 07:32.274
We can give it to them.
In the Maternity Home.

07:32.275 --> 07:33.954
Maternity Home.

07:35.714 --> 07:39.992
Since Dr Turner lost his wife,
he's been nothing but grand schemes.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.512
We'll have half the East End
trying to book in there

07:42.513 --> 07:45.031
instead of gritting their teeth
and getting on with it!

07:45.032 --> 07:47.951
They shouldn't have to
grit their teeth and get on with it.

07:47.952 --> 07:50.913
All of the younger midwives have
been trained in analgesia.

07:50.914 --> 07:52.992
I've been trained myself.

07:52.993 --> 07:55.511
When are you going to
get yourself to an optician?

07:55.512 --> 07:58.111
Your work
and your patients will suffer,

07:58.112 --> 08:00.150
if you can't see what you're doing.

08:00.151 --> 08:03.272
Sister Evangelina, Molly Brignall
missed her appointment today.

08:03.273 --> 08:04.431
Oh, another one?

08:04.432 --> 08:07.270
She's almost at term, and we haven't
seen her for four weeks now.

08:07.271 --> 08:09.030
You'll have to call in
there tomorrow

08:09.031 --> 08:11.632
after you've finished
your morning list. Yes, Sister.

08:11.633 --> 08:13.351
Hello.

08:25.511 --> 08:28.308
What other options we got, Mol?
What other options we got?

08:28.309 --> 08:30.710
Cos I certainly can't
think of any, can you?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.708
Don't know.

08:32.710 --> 08:35.229
No, you don't know, do ya? Hey?

08:35.230 --> 08:38.668
We've not got a penny piece.
What am I supposed to do?

08:38.669 --> 08:41.669
Ritchie, it's nearly my time!
I can't do it!

08:42.828 --> 08:44.949
Midwife calling!
Is anyone at home?

08:47.629 --> 08:49.467
I'm afraid if you don't answer,

08:49.468 --> 08:52.229
someone more senior will have
to call tomorrow.

09:02.908 --> 09:04.708
Come in, Nurse.

09:09.588 --> 09:12.986
Cup of tea, Nurse? It's in the pot.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.747
No, thank you.

09:16.467 --> 09:20.467
I'll bring a fresh bottle of milk
back after I've done my shift.

09:20.468 --> 09:22.307
Tinned will do.

09:23.827 --> 09:25.666
Whatever the lady wants, hey?

09:36.786 --> 09:40.064
I'm sorry to call by unannounced,

09:40.065 --> 09:43.065
but it is a worry
when you don't come to the clinic.

09:43.066 --> 09:44.985
It's on the wrong bus route.

09:52.545 --> 09:54.223
What's this?

09:54.224 --> 09:56.904
Banged it on the handle
of the wardrobe.

10:03.384 --> 10:07.422
According to your notes, you're
down for a home delivery, Molly.

10:07.423 --> 10:10.583
I'll have all this
looking like the ideal home by then.

10:15.343 --> 10:20.823
Oh, hello, lovely!
This is my little Lorraine.

10:22.422 --> 10:26.942
It's only the nurse.
No-one's going to hurt you.

10:29.022 --> 10:31.380
I can't understand why that
hovel has been

10:31.381 --> 10:33.460
passed as fit for home delivery!

10:33.461 --> 10:35.580
I checked the records
when I got back,

10:35.581 --> 10:37.659
and five weeks ago it was
deemed as suitable.

10:37.660 --> 10:41.019
Jenny, five weeks ago, it was!
I passed it fit myself.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.699
It was probably her mother.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.459
When I delivered Molly's first,

10:44.460 --> 10:46.539
she was at it non-stop with
the Stardrops.

10:46.540 --> 10:49.379
If someone was helping Molly,
then we have to find out why that

10:49.380 --> 10:52.818
help has stopped, and if it can be
resumed before the baby's born.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.860
Sister Monica Joan,
you haven't had the Swiss roll.

10:55.861 --> 10:59.099
I cannot excite
myself about a fatless sponge.

10:59.100 --> 11:02.940
It is principally air,
and I feel untethered by it.

11:04.619 --> 11:07.018
You must speak to Molly's mother.

11:07.019 --> 11:09.297
If an improvement cannot be
guaranteed,

11:09.298 --> 11:12.177
then Molly must be booked into the
hospital for a hospital birth.

11:12.178 --> 11:14.497
She was adamant
she didn't want that.

11:14.498 --> 11:17.457
Or more to the point,
her husband didn't want that.

11:17.458 --> 11:20.018
Sorry. But I find that the most
disturbing thing of all.

11:23.978 --> 11:26.536
What I wouldn't
give for another cup of tea!

11:26.537 --> 11:27.897
No shilly-shallying!

11:27.898 --> 11:29.976
By all accounts,
Bella Collins pops them out

11:29.977 --> 11:31.616
as though she's shelling peas.

11:31.617 --> 11:34.377
With any luck we'll be
back in time for Horlicks.

11:41.337 --> 11:43.336
Here comes the cavalry!

11:43.337 --> 11:45.616
Bella! It's the nurses.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.496
Obviously not a false alarm!

11:51.536 --> 11:53.255
I'll leave you to it.

11:53.256 --> 11:55.214
Hooter's gone
off for the evening shift,

11:55.215 --> 11:57.054
I need to go and buy myself a pie.

11:57.055 --> 11:59.656
It'd just be inconsiderate,
asking her for sandwiches.

12:07.415 --> 12:10.214
You'll wear yourself out, Bella!

12:10.215 --> 12:13.615
Now, Nurse Foster says last time
you had a splendid chat

12:13.616 --> 12:16.533
about Pat Boone
between contractions.

12:16.534 --> 12:19.894
And during contractions
I screamed my bloody head off.

12:19.895 --> 12:22.693
Oh, it never gets any easier.

12:22.694 --> 12:26.294
And I've gone off Pat Boone
since he sang Tutti Frutti.

12:26.295 --> 12:28.773
You're ticketty-boo.

12:28.774 --> 12:31.891
Now if Nurse Miller helps me
rearrange the bedclothes,

12:31.892 --> 12:33.771
it might well be
when we examine you,

12:33.772 --> 12:36.171
you'll be ready to start helping
baby on its way.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.651
Aw, full marks, Bella!

12:37.652 --> 12:40.293
You've already put
the paper on the mattress.

12:40.294 --> 12:43.333
I reckon it's a right
big bugger this time.

12:45.292 --> 12:46.652
What's going on?

12:52.652 --> 12:55.970
Sorry, old bean, you're still only
six fingers dilated.

12:55.971 --> 12:58.850
Seems this baby isn't quite such
a Speedy Gonzales as we thought.

12:58.851 --> 13:00.849
I'm getting too old to do
this again!

13:00.850 --> 13:03.811
Stuff and nonsense,
you're quite the spring chicken.

13:09.451 --> 13:12.169
Perhaps you'd like to try
some pethidine?

13:12.170 --> 13:14.008
I'm not going down that road again!

13:14.009 --> 13:17.010
It makes the wallpaper look as
if it's moving.

13:18.850 --> 13:21.889
I need the doctor.

13:21.890 --> 13:25.088
I'm quite sure we don't need to
trouble Doctor...

13:25.089 --> 13:27.769
Haven't you ever heard of a
mother's instinct before?

13:27.770 --> 13:30.449
I need him to come.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.609
I'm in agony!

13:41.089 --> 13:42.888
Mrs Gray?

13:43.928 --> 13:46.087
Has my Molly had the baby?

13:46.088 --> 13:48.568
No, Mrs Gray. I need to talk to you.

13:51.248 --> 13:54.527
Molly was as good as gold till
she was 14.

13:54.528 --> 13:57.205
Then she got a bust,
and started giving lip.

13:57.206 --> 14:00.327
She started saying, "Why did you
send me off to the country?

14:00.328 --> 14:03.806
"Didn't you want me?
I never asked to go."

14:03.807 --> 14:06.406
She'd been home years then,

14:06.407 --> 14:09.687
I shouldn't think she could
remember being on the farm.

14:09.688 --> 14:12.485
Was she evacuated, during the war?

14:12.486 --> 14:16.685
Tenterden, in Kent.
Molly and her brother.

14:16.686 --> 14:20.125
Labels round their necks,
brand new plimsolls.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.686
And their dad was just
a telegram on the mantelpiece.

14:24.046 --> 14:26.365
Missing in action at El-Alamein.

14:29.805 --> 14:33.725
Mrs Gray. The worst thing about my
job is that I sometimes have to pry.

14:36.045 --> 14:39.284
I'm afraid I've come here today
to pry about Molly.

14:40.604 --> 14:43.444
You don't want to be getting mixed
up in her sort of mess.

14:43.445 --> 14:45.123
You're a young girl.

14:45.124 --> 14:48.284
You want to be out doing
your dancing, somewhere way up West.

14:48.285 --> 14:50.403
No, I don't.

14:50.404 --> 14:53.163
I did my dancing during the war.

14:53.164 --> 14:55.923
It was like my kids had been
magicked away.

14:57.523 --> 15:00.043
I thought we could just pick up
the pieces when peace came,

15:00.044 --> 15:02.482
but we never did.

15:02.483 --> 15:04.203
My boy's in the Army now.

15:05.563 --> 15:09.000
I saved up, got a phone put in,
but he never calls.

15:09.001 --> 15:11.882
Got keys cut for Molly,
but she don't come round.

15:13.122 --> 15:16.082
We are quite
worried about Molly, Mrs Gray.

15:17.962 --> 15:21.441
I was wondering
if you yourself had any concerns?

15:21.442 --> 15:23.201
What, you mean apart from him?

15:23.202 --> 15:26.321
Apart from him and including him.

15:28.241 --> 15:30.321
She won't talk to me about anything.

15:32.521 --> 15:37.519
She's always saying, "Ritchie
loves me, Mum. He protects me.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.800
"He never lets me out of his sight".

15:41.400 --> 15:43.360
I never wanted her to marry him.

15:45.440 --> 15:49.799
When the first was on the way,
I was terrified he wouldn't.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.199
But he did.

15:54.879 --> 15:58.437
If Molly can't clean up her living
conditions, Mrs Gray,

15:58.438 --> 16:02.399
I'm very much afraid that Social
Services will want to get involved.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.198
Is it as bad as that?

16:04.199 --> 16:06.158
It's every bit as bad as that.

16:13.958 --> 16:16.238
Help me!

16:30.037 --> 16:31.835
You were right to send for me.

16:31.836 --> 16:34.514
I'd always be concerned
about ante-partum haemorrhage,

16:34.515 --> 16:35.954
when the pain is very acute.

16:35.955 --> 16:38.914
But all is well.
There's no cause for concern.

16:38.915 --> 16:42.034
Oh, none at all.
I'm only having a bloomin' baby!

16:42.035 --> 16:44.474
Everything's going like
clockwork, Bella.

16:44.475 --> 16:47.234
Absolutely. You'll be done
and dusted in an hour or two!

16:47.235 --> 16:50.273
I want gas.
Dr Turner's got some in his boot.

16:50.274 --> 16:52.515
He said so,
when he was at the clinic!

16:52.516 --> 16:54.955
I want gas!

17:17.473 --> 17:22.193
That's right, Well done,
Bella. Well done!

17:26.313 --> 17:30.073
I just want little pushes now.
Can you hear me?

17:33.432 --> 17:35.992
Little push.

17:38.512 --> 17:40.871
Head's born.

17:40.872 --> 17:43.032
Bravo. Absolutely top-notch.

17:45.351 --> 17:48.350
And so is the gas and air,
if I may say so.

17:48.351 --> 17:52.030
Now, Bella, I want one
absolutely mammoth push,

17:52.031 --> 17:54.310
and then it'll all be over.

17:54.311 --> 17:56.111
Concentrate now!

18:06.990 --> 18:09.030
Congratulations, Mrs Collins!

18:11.230 --> 18:13.349
You have a little girl, Bella.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.389
I'll be spreading
the news about that gas.

18:18.390 --> 18:21.749
Oh, just you wait,
they'll all be wanting it!

19:40.624 --> 19:43.062
Thanks, Mum.

19:43.063 --> 19:46.263
Don't have to thank me.
I'm your mother.

19:48.183 --> 19:50.223
Wonderful.

19:51.583 --> 19:54.300
The flat's in pristine condition,
and so are you.

19:54.301 --> 19:56.700
I'll let Sister Julienne
know all's well,

19:56.701 --> 19:59.022
and register you for home delivery.

20:07.821 --> 20:10.459
Nobody told me
we'd be having company.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.979
Molly's baby's almost due,
Mr Brignall.

20:12.980 --> 20:15.901
She'll have regular
visits from midwives from now on.

20:15.902 --> 20:18.901
I didn't mean you. I meant her.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.778
Get out! Get out!
We don't need you here!

20:38.779 --> 20:40.817
I look after her.
I know what's best.

20:40.818 --> 20:44.217
If you know what's good for yourself,
now leave. Don't push me! Leave!

20:44.218 --> 20:45.537
Please don't hurt her!

20:45.538 --> 20:48.337
I will hurt her unless you leave!
Get out!

20:48.338 --> 20:50.059
Get out and leave us alone.

20:53.898 --> 20:56.416
I've said it to her,
and I'll say it to you.

20:56.417 --> 20:59.658
You clear out of my home, or I'll
burn her, and I'll burn her again!

20:59.659 --> 21:01.098
That's enough.

21:20.176 --> 21:22.495
Where's Lorraine?

21:22.496 --> 21:23.936
She went behind the sofa.

21:25.736 --> 21:28.295
You've seen him in action now.

21:28.296 --> 21:30.336
Yes. I have.

21:37.495 --> 21:39.373
It certainly sounds like assault.

21:39.374 --> 21:42.093
But we need to speak to
Molly Brignall.

21:42.094 --> 21:44.453
Could an officer go round
to the flat?

21:44.454 --> 21:47.495
We could try. But if she won't press
charges, we can't prosecute.

21:47.496 --> 21:50.733
I could press charges.
Ritchie threatened me!

21:50.734 --> 21:54.773
I think, if you did that now,

21:54.774 --> 21:57.734
Ritchie would not allow Molly
to receive care.

21:58.774 --> 22:02.132
The needs of the patient
must come first.

22:02.133 --> 22:05.773
I know Molly's needs, Sister!
She needs him.

22:07.013 --> 22:09.173
And worse, she wants him.

22:10.613 --> 22:13.693
She thinks he loves her, I can tell.

22:14.813 --> 22:17.612
Whenever he's in the room,
her eyes follow him.

22:19.412 --> 22:21.691
Like a dog's eyes. It's pitiful.

22:21.692 --> 22:26.252
Nurse, we're not here to pity!
We are here to serve.

22:32.771 --> 22:36.051
A man may beat his wife with a stick
no bigger than his thumb.

22:36.052 --> 22:40.890
It is enshrined in statute, and
occasionally cited in the courts.

22:40.891 --> 22:43.651
Sister,
are you sure that's still the case?

22:43.652 --> 22:47.249
He is entitled to do it
if she cuckolds him,

22:47.250 --> 22:50.889
insults his beard,
or wishes pain upon his teeth.

22:50.890 --> 22:53.529
I am reminded of the latter

22:53.530 --> 22:57.849
because my own molars have been
a source of some discomfort.

22:57.850 --> 23:02.089
And we are faced with
ginger nuts again.

23:03.649 --> 23:08.648
You are apprised of my method,
Sister. I await your permission.

23:08.649 --> 23:10.808
Of course.

23:10.809 --> 23:13.207
No more gas
and air at home deliveries.

23:13.208 --> 23:16.646
I've had it out with Dr Turner,
and he has conceded defeat.

23:16.647 --> 23:19.606
Surely not? Women have been begging
for gas and air!

23:19.607 --> 23:22.326
And you have absolutely no
business giving in to them!

23:22.327 --> 23:25.886
Doctor's been prevented from seeing
half his patients.

23:25.887 --> 23:29.127
He's just sat at his desk,
and his face was grey.

23:29.128 --> 23:33.446
I'm sorry, Sister, but it's 1958.
Women want pain relief.

23:33.447 --> 23:36.807
Good management of labour is
not about medical folderols.

23:36.808 --> 23:41.206
It is about care, and making sure
the woman feels supported.

23:41.207 --> 23:43.805
Besides, we already carry pethidine.

23:43.806 --> 23:47.005
And nitrous oxide simply
isn't practical.

23:47.006 --> 23:49.964
If you ask me, Dr Turner's
completely over-reached himself.

23:49.965 --> 23:53.044
Has anyone else noticed a button's
come off his clinical coat?

23:53.045 --> 23:55.206
He's got no-one to sew
it on for him.

23:55.207 --> 23:57.484
It hardly inspires confidence!

23:57.485 --> 24:00.445
Ugh, and his poor little boy's
looking quite unkempt.

24:00.446 --> 24:03.444
Speak more respectfully of
Doctor, please.

24:03.445 --> 24:06.325
And I'll thank you to hand me
the malt loaf.

24:10.445 --> 24:12.603
Anything exciting?

24:12.604 --> 24:16.484
I was just reading Situations
Vacant, for old time's sake.

24:16.485 --> 24:21.043
It takes me right back to my
otherwise entirely ghastly youth,

24:21.044 --> 24:23.604
dreaming of Africa,
and the missions.

24:24.724 --> 24:27.723
There's a six month posting here,
to Sierra Leone.

24:28.843 --> 24:31.323
Just my cup of tea,
once upon a time.

24:35.283 --> 24:37.683
Will you test me
on the Prostitution Laws?

24:40.162 --> 24:43.042
You can recite
the Prostitution Laws in your sleep!

24:43.043 --> 24:45.161
I can recite them in my sleep.

24:45.162 --> 24:47.882
That's the point.
I'm aiming for promotion.

24:48.922 --> 24:52.202
No point in ambitions,
if you don't try to achieve them.

24:52.203 --> 24:54.801
No. I don't suppose there is.

24:59.721 --> 25:02.440
Now, shall we begin with
importuning?

25:02.441 --> 25:05.401
Or do you want to ring the changes
with procurement?

25:18.480 --> 25:20.640
Molly, are you there?

25:32.279 --> 25:34.959
Please open the door, Molly.

25:49.438 --> 25:52.556
Ritchie said
I had to leave the bolt on.

25:52.557 --> 25:56.237
Molly, in the next few days,
you're going to have a baby.

25:58.957 --> 26:03.797
And you are going to need help,
and I think you know that.

26:13.756 --> 26:18.435
What should I do,
when the baby comes?

26:18.436 --> 26:24.555
You must telephone Nonnatus House.
That's Poplar, 459.

26:25.875 --> 26:30.234
We've arranged for you to have the
baby in the Maternity Home.

26:30.235 --> 26:33.034
What about Lorraine?

26:33.035 --> 26:35.593
You mustn't leave her alone.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.794
I never leave her alone.

26:39.994 --> 26:41.954
I love him.

26:43.354 --> 26:45.353
But I know him.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.112
And I love her.

26:48.113 --> 26:49.793
Of course you do.

26:53.633 --> 26:56.273
You could ask your mother to
look after her.

26:57.673 --> 27:00.152
Molly!

27:00.153 --> 27:02.152
Molly!

27:46.309 --> 27:49.547
I swear one day, if ever
I go a long, way away from here,

27:49.548 --> 27:53.509
this is the smell that would have me
sobbing hot tears of nostalgia.

27:53.510 --> 27:56.788
Sarson's malt,
and a dash of printer's ink.

27:56.789 --> 28:00.028
You aren't going a long, long
way away are you?

28:00.029 --> 28:02.627
Gosh, no. Honeymoon in Ramsgate.

28:02.628 --> 28:05.907
That was enough to
quench my wanderlust.

28:05.908 --> 28:08.988
Besides, I've a pack of wolf cubs
to keep in order.

28:10.748 --> 28:12.348
No, this is home now.

28:13.468 --> 28:14.986
Wherever I went,

28:14.987 --> 28:17.947
I'd wing my way back
here like a bally racing pigeon.

28:19.147 --> 28:20.827
Home. Heart is. All of that.

28:23.387 --> 28:27.107
The heart ends up making its home
in some very peculiar places,

28:27.108 --> 28:28.865
if you ask me.

28:28.866 --> 28:31.066
Are you talking
about Molly Brignall?

28:33.066 --> 28:34.706
I've never loved a brutal man.

28:37.506 --> 28:39.506
I've loved a wrong one.

28:41.106 --> 28:47.585
It was so hard to break away, and
for Molly that would be even harder.

28:51.305 --> 28:54.505
I'm not sure
she could find the courage.

28:55.785 --> 29:01.264
Gosh. Courage. Wish we could bottle
it, like gas and air.

29:02.704 --> 29:05.144
Sister Evangelina wouldn't approve.

29:10.823 --> 29:14.502
Oh, Lord. You did it.
You got new specs!

29:14.503 --> 29:17.901
My prescription had to be revised,
so it did seem justified.

29:17.902 --> 29:19.701
The frames really do suit you.

29:19.702 --> 29:21.861
They're much
lighter than your old pair.

29:21.862 --> 29:25.300
Oh, it's not the colour.
It's absolutely the upsweep.

29:25.301 --> 29:28.300
Opens the peepers wider than three
coats of mascara.

29:28.301 --> 29:30.820
Do come and look
at Sister Bernadette's glasses!

29:30.821 --> 29:34.380
They could only be
improved by diamante on the arms.

29:34.381 --> 29:37.260
I don't think you can get
diamante on the National Health.

29:37.261 --> 29:40.741
Are they on the National Health?
Oh, go on. Indulge me.

29:45.941 --> 29:48.021
What do you think?

29:50.301 --> 29:54.060
I take it the upswept frame
and I are not soul mates?

30:00.900 --> 30:04.500
Sister. It is time to partake with
the privilege of silence.

30:24.778 --> 30:26.818
I'm off.

30:32.258 --> 30:36.217
I'll bring you back a Babycham.
If you're good.

30:36.218 --> 30:38.137
I'm always good.

30:39.377 --> 30:42.056
So come here, and give us a kiss.

30:42.057 --> 30:44.017
No. You come here.

30:45.417 --> 30:46.776
Nah.

30:46.777 --> 30:48.817
And I want to hear that bolt go on.

31:15.615 --> 31:17.775
Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.453
Camilla? It's me.

31:19.454 --> 31:23.532
Mr Impertinence. We're both on duty.
I'm just off on a house call.

31:23.533 --> 31:27.332
Listen, we've had a call from the
West India Dock night watchman.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.534
'It seems there's a woman in
labour, on a ship..

31:29.535 --> 31:30.613
Passenger ship?

31:30.614 --> 31:31.933
No, cargo.

31:31.934 --> 31:34.651
Cargo? Women aren't
permitted on cargo ships.

31:34.652 --> 31:37.093
I have to say,
I don't much like the sound of it.

31:37.094 --> 31:39.292
Who's on call?
Trixie.

31:39.293 --> 31:42.493
Don't send her on her own.
Fetch Jenny. Quickly.

31:44.093 --> 31:45.452
Mum!

31:45.453 --> 31:47.133
Molly?

31:53.212 --> 31:55.530
Still think it may be some
sort of a ruse.

31:55.531 --> 31:57.890
We could end up being robbed
till we're floating

31:57.891 --> 31:59.452
face down in the docks.

31:59.453 --> 32:02.971
Come on now,
all the nice girls love a sailor.

32:06.811 --> 32:08.849
'Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.'

32:08.850 --> 32:12.569
It's Molly Brignall's mother. I'm
bringing her to the Maternity Home.

32:12.570 --> 32:14.609
I'm sorry, Trixie.
I need to go to Molly.

32:14.610 --> 32:16.688
But you've already said
you'll come with me!

32:16.689 --> 32:19.208
Molly needs to be with
somebody she trusts.

32:19.209 --> 32:21.810
And I don't need to be with
Sister Evangelina!

32:37.049 --> 32:39.288
Who alerted the night watchman?

32:39.289 --> 32:42.168
It was this gentleman,
Sister Evangelina.

32:42.169 --> 32:46.247
He's the captain of the ship you can
see across the river.

32:46.248 --> 32:49.406
Ah. Well, I shan't waste my breath
asking you a straight question.

32:49.407 --> 32:51.968
Because I won't get a
straight answer.

32:51.969 --> 32:56.007
My English has limits.
Mitt sprak ar Svenska.

32:56.008 --> 33:00.326
German. No sprachen,
you're out of luck.

33:00.327 --> 33:03.247
The ship's sailing under
the Swedish flag, Sister.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.846
No sprachen Swedish either.

33:05.847 --> 33:08.005
Has anyone inspected this
man's papers?

33:08.006 --> 33:11.405
Nurse. This is no time to play
the shrinking violet.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.287
It just seems rather irregular.

33:16.126 --> 33:18.845
How... is... the... mother?

33:18.846 --> 33:20.446
Ah.

33:22.326 --> 33:25.645
Very great scream.
Every five minutes.

33:25.646 --> 33:27.486
That regular enough for you?

33:27.487 --> 33:28.965
Follow me.

33:36.885 --> 33:39.725
I thought it would be more
like a hospital.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.564
No, not at all.

33:41.565 --> 33:44.962
Dr Turner's in charge,
and the midwives deliver the babies,

33:44.963 --> 33:47.164
just as they would
if you were at home.

33:47.165 --> 33:49.003
Will you deliver mine?

33:49.004 --> 33:51.244
Of course. That's why I'm here.

34:07.283 --> 34:11.081
I've never been on an ocean-going
vessel in my life.

34:11.081 --> 34:16.562
Just shake your golden curls.
Pretend it's the Good Ship Lollipop.

34:20.282 --> 34:22.002
But how do they get us on board?

34:24.161 --> 34:28.281
Probably just winch this boat up.
Be a piece of cake.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.041
Very well.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.840
And now, follow me.

34:47.040 --> 34:50.438
I'm sorry. I'm not really
dressed for gymnastics.

34:50.438 --> 34:54.918
Pull yourself together. No-one's
going to be looking up your drawers!

34:54.920 --> 34:58.519
Um, er, important! We have bags.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.359
Come!

35:23.957 --> 35:26.917
I won't waste my breath saying
"after you."

35:28.717 --> 35:32.197
You can touch up your lipstick
while you're waiting.

36:23.193 --> 36:25.353
My arm!

36:27.193 --> 36:29.353
Leave me be! Leave me be!

37:18.429 --> 37:19.988
Oh, Lord.

37:19.989 --> 37:22.747
If I've ever given you
the impression that

37:22.748 --> 37:26.189
I don't believe in you,
I absolutely promise that I do now.

37:59.427 --> 38:01.586
I did it!

38:03.706 --> 38:06.346
One curtain call only,
your bouquet's in the post.

38:24.745 --> 38:27.225
Auf Wiedersehen. Frauleins only!

38:28.424 --> 38:30.304
Shutsen!

38:31.904 --> 38:34.743
I am so happy to see some
other women!

38:34.744 --> 38:41.223
Men, they don't know anything.
Me, I don't know much.

38:41.224 --> 38:45.462
You don't need to know anything.
Now we're here.

38:45.463 --> 38:49.742
I'm Sister Evangelina,
and this is Nurse Franklin.

38:49.743 --> 38:51.662
I'm Kirsten.

38:51.663 --> 38:56.182
What a pretty name!
Kirsten, now then.

38:56.183 --> 38:59.021
Let's have a little look, shall we?

38:59.022 --> 39:01.742
Well, baby looks nice and cosy.

39:03.422 --> 39:05.701
But I can't be expecting.

39:05.702 --> 39:07.742
Pinard, if you would Nurse.

39:09.502 --> 39:12.741
Obese. We're in for shenanigans,
mark my words.

39:14.821 --> 39:18.260
Yes. Yes, a heartbeat.

39:18.261 --> 39:21.100
A baby?

39:21.101 --> 39:23.900
Kicking away to beat the band.

39:23.901 --> 39:25.259
A baby?

39:25.260 --> 39:26.619
Yes, of course.

39:26.620 --> 39:28.059
Are you certain?

39:28.060 --> 39:31.900
Yes, and a good thing too, I didn't
fancy taking out your appendix.

39:31.901 --> 39:34.739
My father said it was a baby.

39:34.740 --> 39:38.020
He remembered my mother's cries,
when she gave birth to me.

39:38.021 --> 39:39.419
Your father?

39:39.420 --> 39:43.019
He's the captain.
My mother died many years ago.

39:44.139 --> 39:46.937
I want her examined internally
without delay.

39:46.938 --> 39:49.737
Yes, Sister. How am
I going to access the birth canal?

39:49.738 --> 39:51.697
She's wedged into that
bunk like a sardine!

39:51.698 --> 39:53.816
I'm sorry to have to break
this to you, Nurse,

39:53.817 --> 39:57.218
but you're just going to have to
use your common sense.

39:57.219 --> 39:59.217
Sorry, sweetheart.

39:59.218 --> 40:01.336
I really need to put you
somewhere comfy,

40:01.337 --> 40:03.816
where you can lie on your back
with your legs apart.

40:03.817 --> 40:05.856
Would you tell that to my father?

40:05.857 --> 40:09.015
It wasn't so bad
when he first brought me on board,

40:09.016 --> 40:11.937
but there's more flesh to me
now than it was then.

40:13.377 --> 40:17.737
I have had men slide right off my
body, and fall onto the floor.

40:17.738 --> 40:19.056
Men?

40:19.057 --> 40:20.616
The sailors.

40:20.617 --> 40:22.016
I see.

40:22.017 --> 40:24.694
My father always says there is no
fighting on a ship

40:24.695 --> 40:27.216
when the crew have a woman they
can go to for relief.

40:28.896 --> 40:31.176
He's got it all organised,
hasn't he?

40:31.177 --> 40:35.175
He thinks of everything.
You feel under my pillow.

40:35.176 --> 40:36.815
Go on.

40:41.095 --> 40:45.575
What an absolutely enormous
amount of contraceptive sheaths.

40:46.735 --> 40:51.013
My father has never, ever,
let me run out of rubbers

40:51.014 --> 40:53.654
and I'm free from disease and...

41:02.774 --> 41:05.173
and I cannot get pregnant.

41:05.174 --> 41:07.533
Help me up.

41:13.933 --> 41:18.013
Your daughter, mein Herren, must be
removed to a decent cabin.

41:18.014 --> 41:23.051
She needs clean bed, hot water,
bright lights, soap and towels.

41:23.052 --> 41:26.691
Comprendez? And if he doesn't
comprendez, do you?

41:26.692 --> 41:29.652
There's nae need to holler at me.
I'm fae Glasgow.

41:35.171 --> 41:36.650
Sister.

41:36.651 --> 41:39.971
I don't know you've done to yourself
but I want you on that chair now.

41:39.972 --> 41:42.690
I've dislocated my shoulder.

41:42.691 --> 41:46.129
I can feel the displacement,
and I can't move my arm.

41:46.130 --> 41:48.208
I've a jolly good mind to
give you pethidine.

41:48.209 --> 41:50.210
The pethidine is for the patient!

41:51.370 --> 41:54.930
And we'll have a bottle of brandy
while you're about it!

42:02.050 --> 42:04.889
I saw a horse have a foal when
I was in the country.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.409
Did you?

42:07.969 --> 42:11.249
I sat on the gate with my brother,
and I watched it happen.

42:13.889 --> 42:18.847
They don't do it like we do, horses.
They stay standing.

42:18.848 --> 42:21.527
Or that one did.

42:21.528 --> 42:24.408
As though it liked
the feeling of the sun on its back.

42:27.928 --> 42:29.768
It's all right.

42:34.687 --> 42:37.767
Try not to bite your lip, Molly.
You'll make it bleed.

42:48.926 --> 42:50.926
It don't hurt.

42:52.926 --> 42:57.246
It didn't hurt the horse,
it just stood there.

42:59.366 --> 43:00.925
Kirsten.

43:18.644 --> 43:20.563
Tak, Fader.

43:20.564 --> 43:22.203
Du fortjanar det.

43:22.204 --> 43:26.124
If I deserve it,
why did you wait until now?

43:33.323 --> 43:36.243
Thank you, Captain. Raus.

43:37.283 --> 43:40.723
I'll take over from here.

43:49.162 --> 43:52.842
Not too late for the gas
and air, Molly. Nothing! Sure?

44:10.041 --> 44:12.880
Gosh. Plenty of room in here!

44:18.040 --> 44:21.159
Sister. Sister!

44:21.160 --> 44:22.439
What?

44:22.440 --> 44:24.558
I think we've got
a prankster on our hands.

44:24.559 --> 44:27.597
It appears to have pushed its cord
into the birth canal.

44:27.598 --> 44:30.397
Prolapsed? I'm not actually sure.
I've never had to deal with one.

44:30.398 --> 44:32.357
Well, you're just going to
have to stay calm,

44:32.358 --> 44:34.877
and remember what you were
taught in training!

44:34.878 --> 44:37.557
In training, they said a Caesarean
section may be needed!

44:37.558 --> 44:39.477
Well, we haven't got that luxury.

44:39.478 --> 44:41.876
You need her on her knees,
with her head on her forearms

44:41.877 --> 44:43.156
and her bottom in the air.

44:43.157 --> 44:46.516
If I got her into that position,
she wouldn't be able to sustain it!

44:46.517 --> 44:48.836
Well, you've to get the cord
out of the way!

44:48.837 --> 44:50.956
If the baby's head crushes
it on the way down,

44:50.957 --> 44:53.278
it will stop the oxygen,
and it might die.

44:56.117 --> 44:57.836
You look worried.

44:57.837 --> 45:01.517
Oh no, that's just my silent
sympathetic glance.

45:02.957 --> 45:04.596
On your feet.

45:04.597 --> 45:07.196
What? I need your chair.

45:07.197 --> 45:09.556
What you going to do?
Put your feet up!

45:09.557 --> 45:14.595
Not my feet, Sister. Her pelvis.
Trust me, Sister.

45:14.596 --> 45:17.035
You look like a lion tamer.

45:17.036 --> 45:20.554
Frankly, Sister Evangelina,
taming a lion would be preferable.

45:20.555 --> 45:22.553
Now, would you
like some more brandy?

45:22.554 --> 45:25.755
No, thank you. I am replete.
Then I'll proceed.

45:29.515 --> 45:32.554
Sweetie, can you raise your bottom.

45:32.555 --> 45:35.074
As far as you can.

45:35.075 --> 45:39.953
Taking as much weight
on your shoulders as possible.

45:39.954 --> 45:41.953
Like what...?

45:41.954 --> 45:45.152
It's all very well playing
tricks with gravity,

45:45.153 --> 45:47.994
but how's she actually going to
deliver in that position?

45:52.833 --> 45:54.511
I think a boat went past.

45:54.512 --> 45:58.153
Unless it has an obstetrician on it,
that's of no interest to me!

45:58.154 --> 45:59.592
And Sister!

45:59.593 --> 46:04.191
I asked you to trust me, because
if you don't, I won't trust myself!

46:04.192 --> 46:06.312
And Kirsten won't trust me either.

46:06.313 --> 46:09.511
Yes, I am. I trust you.

46:09.512 --> 46:10.992
I trust you.

46:13.192 --> 46:14.952
Ready, sweetie?

46:17.672 --> 46:20.309
I am going to press very
hard on your baby's head,

46:20.310 --> 46:22.911
but you need to stay exactly
where you are.

46:22.912 --> 46:24.671
Ya!

46:27.711 --> 46:30.950
Feel for the pubic bone
with your left hand!

46:30.951 --> 46:32.991
I'm feeling for it!

46:36.870 --> 46:39.230
It's here. It's here.

46:41.110 --> 46:43.150
Keep up the external pressure.

46:43.151 --> 46:45.229
What if I tear the sac?

46:45.230 --> 46:50.109
You won't tear the sac, because
we're not going to lose this baby.

47:12.948 --> 47:16.106
There really ought to be some
sort of a fanfare.

47:16.107 --> 47:20.987
The cord's slipped back, and I can't
feel anything but the baby's head.

47:28.227 --> 47:30.507
Lift up now, sweetie.

47:37.266 --> 47:38.865
I'm wetting the bed!

47:38.866 --> 47:41.225
No. Your waters have broken.

47:41.226 --> 47:44.266
And you're now in the perfect
position for delivery.

47:46.265 --> 47:48.625
Let's just put him
on your chest a moment.

47:50.705 --> 47:54.625
Ritchie wanted a boy.
Hope he's got his father's eyes.

48:09.944 --> 48:13.262
If he was like that little foal,
he'd be up on his legs

48:13.263 --> 48:15.063
and running around in a minute.

48:16.543 --> 48:19.662
All through the flowers
and the grass.

48:19.663 --> 48:21.863
I imagine he would.

48:24.343 --> 48:28.541
My mum says to me,
"Moll, you shouldn't romanticise.

48:28.542 --> 48:32.902
"You shouldn't always go seeing
the beauty where there's none!"

48:35.542 --> 48:39.462
But if I didn't, then,
what would there be to see?

49:17.259 --> 49:19.458
Come along, young madam.

49:19.459 --> 49:23.939
It's a girl? It's a girl!

49:25.379 --> 49:27.496
Shake a leg. It's your birthday!

49:27.497 --> 49:30.578
It's in shock. You'll have to smack
it on the backside.

49:30.579 --> 49:32.618
No! Don't touch her!

49:34.378 --> 49:39.298
There's no need to hurt her.
She's doing it all for herself.

49:54.736 --> 49:57.655
♪ Ja, ma hon leva!

49:57.656 --> 50:00.535
♪ Ja, ma hon leva!

50:00.536 --> 50:03.176
♪ Ja, ma hon leva uti
hundrade ar... ♪

50:05.616 --> 50:09.094
♪ Javisst ska hon leva... ♪

50:09.095 --> 50:11.614
You've made the crew very happy.

50:11.615 --> 50:15.054
I always make them happy.
It is my job.

50:15.055 --> 50:18.013
Well, if you intend to
continue in this vein,

50:18.014 --> 50:20.895
you'll have to sort
your contraception out.

50:20.896 --> 50:22.934
All of that can wait.

50:25.654 --> 50:28.934
I have lived without
friendship for such a long time.

50:30.614 --> 50:33.614
But today, you came.

50:38.213 --> 50:39.813
And she came, too.

50:42.533 --> 50:44.693
So now I have a friend for ever.

50:51.772 --> 50:53.572
Hey, miss.

51:07.251 --> 51:10.691
There, there, little 'un.
Don't make a sound.

51:34.609 --> 51:36.529
Don't stroke my head!

51:39.769 --> 51:41.089
Nurse.

51:44.289 --> 51:48.887
You have, um, gratitude from me.

51:48.888 --> 51:53.767
And you'll have gratitude from me,
sir, when you have a boat waiting

51:53.768 --> 51:56.728
for me, at the quay, at noon,
every day, for the next two weeks.

51:58.488 --> 52:02.966
Nej, uh... I cannot do that.
You have no choice.

52:02.967 --> 52:06.646
Your exploitation of your daughter
has been shameful.

52:06.647 --> 52:10.366
And it's as easy for me
to report you to the police

52:10.367 --> 52:13.486
as it was for you to call
and ask for help.

52:13.487 --> 52:15.007
Oh.

52:26.766 --> 52:30.046
My shift's not over until I've seen
you safely into hospital.

52:30.047 --> 52:33.445
Make yourself useful.
Pass me the gas and air.

52:47.724 --> 52:50.042
Neighbour saw her coming
back this morning,

52:50.043 --> 52:51.644
with the newborn in her arms.

52:58.364 --> 53:00.723
Molly? Are you at home?

53:01.963 --> 53:05.203
It's very dangerous,
to discharge yourself from care!

53:09.083 --> 53:13.522
Welcome home! Do you want to
meet your little brother?

53:13.523 --> 53:14.801
Yeah!

53:14.802 --> 53:19.322
Yeah? Come on, let's go find him, eh?
Come here!

53:24.922 --> 53:26.761
I'd do anything for her.

53:26.762 --> 53:28.520
I know.

53:28.521 --> 53:31.080
She'd do anything for him.

53:31.081 --> 53:34.201
I can't even tell you the things
that people say.

53:34.202 --> 53:38.080
Ignore them, Mrs Gray.
You know your own daughter.

53:38.081 --> 53:43.519
Yeah. I do. I wish I could
turn back the clock.

53:43.520 --> 53:46.238
If I'd been a better mother,
I could reach her now.

53:46.239 --> 53:49.158
It's Molly whose
skills are in doubt. Not yours.

53:49.159 --> 53:51.440
It's all part
and parcel of the same.

53:52.600 --> 53:54.400
I made a mess of everything.

54:02.959 --> 54:07.719
'I called at Molly's flat each day,
but the door was never opened.

54:08.919 --> 54:14.198
'It seemed she'd locked herself
away in what she thought was love.

54:15.398 --> 54:19.557
'The truth was worse,
though I didn't know it.

54:19.558 --> 54:23.997
'In thrall to her husband, Molly was
leaving her children alone,

54:23.998 --> 54:28.237
'dosed with milk and alcohol
so they didn't cry.

54:54.515 --> 54:58.035
'We knew nothing of her actions
until disaster struck.'

54:58.036 --> 54:59.755
Please, let me through!

55:01.195 --> 55:02.834
Left on her own.

55:02.835 --> 55:05.154
There's another one! A newborn.

55:05.155 --> 55:07.034
Another one!

55:07.035 --> 55:12.273
'In court, the couple were
convicted of child neglect.

55:12.274 --> 55:14.193
'They were both imprisoned.'

55:14.194 --> 55:16.512
Looks like it was
started by a fag end.

55:16.513 --> 55:20.114
'And that was the end of Molly's
journey as a parent.'

55:26.953 --> 55:30.713
'Meanwhile, Trixie, permitted now to
go to work in slacks,

55:30.714 --> 55:33.992
'helped another mother to make
a better start.

55:33.993 --> 55:37.311
'Pushed to her limits,
she had flourished

55:37.312 --> 55:41.232
'and with her support
so did the Captain's daughter.'

55:42.712 --> 55:46.751
A little goodbye present.
Not gift-wrapped, I'm afraid.

55:46.752 --> 55:48.312
It's from the National Health.

55:48.313 --> 55:49.631
I'm Swedish.

55:49.632 --> 55:50.951
I pulled strings.

55:50.952 --> 55:53.509
And these are a very
reputable brand,

55:53.510 --> 55:56.351
they won't fail
you like the last lot did.

55:56.352 --> 55:58.870
I don't need them.

55:58.871 --> 56:01.151
Well. Not this week, one would hope.

56:03.431 --> 56:05.789
I'm going back to Stockholm.

56:05.790 --> 56:09.309
I will live on land,
and walk on grass.

56:09.310 --> 56:13.070
And she will walk on grass,
and her bed will be her own.

56:13.071 --> 56:15.230
Has the captain agreed to it?

56:17.750 --> 56:20.629
I didn't ask him. I told him.

56:21.709 --> 56:25.069
And I would like to say he said
yes because he loves me.

56:25.070 --> 56:28.549
But I think it's
because he's ashamed of himself.

56:29.749 --> 56:32.389
I think he saw himself
through your eyes.

56:33.509 --> 56:38.907
I saw myself through your eyes.
And I was pathetic.

56:38.908 --> 56:43.628
No. No. You were magnificent.

56:44.828 --> 56:46.868
I wasn't then.

56:48.068 --> 56:49.827
But I am a mother now.

56:55.907 --> 56:58.267
Liten flicka.

57:19.865 --> 57:24.704
'Love cannot ease every anguish
in the world but tenderly applied,

57:24.705 --> 57:31.024
'it can transfigure fortunes,
light up faces. Turn the tide.'

57:49.663 --> 57:53.542
'Molly's children went to live
with their grandmother,

57:53.543 --> 57:57.062
'who bought an immaculate pram
on hire purchase,

57:57.063 --> 58:01.301
'investing in the future,
whilst turning back the clock.

58:01.302 --> 58:04.861
'Her spotless house became
a happy home again,

58:04.862 --> 58:07.982
'centred on a baby boy
and a little girl.

58:09.022 --> 58:12.341
'There was pain,
but she could bear it.

58:12.342 --> 58:15.500
'For her journey had come
full circle.

58:15.501 --> 58:18.900
'They were her second chance
at love.

58:18.901 --> 58:21.380
'And she was theirs.'

58:28.341 --> 58:31.340
Do you understand what a very great
step you are about to take?

58:31.341 --> 58:34.419
Absolutely,
and I'm utterly terrified.

58:34.420 --> 58:37.460
Hello, stranger. Oh, my gosh, Jenny.

58:38.740 --> 58:41.659
What happened?
I did everything I could.

58:41.660 --> 58:43.597
You understand
we have to ask these questions?

58:43.682 --> 58:46.043
Constable Noakes,
am I being accused of something?
