WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:02.502
This is the Evergreen

00:02.502 --> 00:03.970
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.970 --> 00:06.206
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.777
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.777 --> 00:12.445
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.980 --> 00:15.882
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.549 --> 00:17.751
Yikes!

00:18.318 --> 00:19.953
Yaaaah...

00:22.355 --> 00:23.923
Yeaaaah!

00:23.923 --> 00:26.826
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.836
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.104 --> 00:39.672
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.209 --> 00:45.512
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.179 --> 00:47.781
the Raccoons!!

00:47.781 --> 00:48.248
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:02.395 --> 01:04.364
It's often said
that truth

01:04.364 --> 01:05.965
is stranger than fiction.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.801
But when it comes
to Cyril Sneer,

01:07.801 --> 01:10.370
it's sometimes hard to
tell the difference.

01:10.370 --> 01:11.571
Barbara LaFrum: Now Mr. Midas,

01:11.571 --> 01:13.840
you've admitted you're
a multi-billionaire,

01:13.840 --> 01:16.876
yet your employees are
treated like slaves.

01:16.876 --> 01:18.545
Sock it to him, Barbara!

01:18.545 --> 01:21.214
You've got old Milton cornered!
Ha ha!

01:21.214 --> 01:24.384
Um, Pop, you know that
charity event I mentioned?

01:24.384 --> 01:27.053
Quiet son,
I'm watching Twenty Minutes.

01:27.053 --> 01:29.089
Barbara LaFrum's
just about ready to

01:29.089 --> 01:32.025
destroy Milton Midas. I love it!

01:32.025 --> 01:34.027
But Pop, you
know how important

01:34.027 --> 01:35.795
this charity is to everyone...

01:35.795 --> 01:38.231
Run along and tell
them I gave at the office.

01:38.231 --> 01:41.501
Please, Miss LaFrum!
Give me another chance!

01:41.501 --> 01:45.238
You're right. My employees
deserve better.

01:45.238 --> 01:46.606
That's pathetic.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.442
How can a grown tycoon
behave like that?

01:49.442 --> 01:51.177
What's the world coming to?

01:51.177 --> 01:54.280
Ah well, better him than me.

01:58.718 --> 02:01.955
...raises all around.
Longer holidays...

02:01.955 --> 02:04.023
Pig 2: Oh, I wish
it was that easy

02:04.023 --> 02:06.526
to get a raise out of the boss.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.228
Pig 1: Maybe it is?

02:09.229 --> 02:10.897
Barbara LaFrum:
And there you have it.

02:10.897 --> 02:12.432
I'm Barbara LaFrum.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.667
Join us next week
on Twenty Minutes

02:14.667 --> 02:17.937
as we bring another
exploiter to justice.

02:17.937 --> 02:21.374
Pig 1: It's ringing. Hello?

02:21.374 --> 02:24.277
Miss Barbara LaFrum?

02:24.277 --> 02:27.080
You don't know me, but boy,

02:27.080 --> 02:29.516
have I got a story for you!

02:30.750 --> 02:33.286
Lady Baden-Baden: Well Melissa,
has there been any decision

02:33.286 --> 02:36.456
on the fundraiser for the
Evergreen touring orchestra?

02:36.456 --> 02:38.258
We're
down to two choices.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.627
A fishing derby or a bake sale.

02:40.627 --> 02:43.129
No contest.
A fishing derby!

02:43.129 --> 02:47.667
Lady Baden-Baden: Well, if I may
offer an alternate suggestion.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.904
How about... a bachelor auction?

02:50.904 --> 02:52.572
A what?

02:52.572 --> 02:54.807
Lady Baden-Baden: It's
a simple concept really.

02:54.807 --> 02:59.779
The eligible bachelors of the
forest create a dream date

02:59.779 --> 03:02.982
and we auction them off
to the highest bidder.

03:02.982 --> 03:04.083
Ralph/Melissa/Cedric/Schaeffer:
Great idea. Fabulous. Brilliant.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.319
You know,
I'm starting to like

03:06.319 --> 03:08.621
that bake sale idea.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.490
I think you're
in the minority, Bert.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.624
Lady Baden-Baden:
Then it's settled.

03:11.624 --> 03:13.760
We'll hold a bachelor auction.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.797
And Cedric, you simply must
convince your father to come.

03:17.797 --> 03:22.335
After all, he is the most
eligible bachelor in the forest.

03:22.335 --> 03:25.471
Well I'll give
it a shot, Lady Baden-Baden.

03:25.471 --> 03:27.574
Couldn't we compromise?

03:27.574 --> 03:31.711
Uh, how about a fishing
derby for bachelors?

03:32.345 --> 03:34.881
Pig 3: She's late. Let's go.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.351
Pig 1: No way. Barbara LaFrum
said she'd be here,

03:38.351 --> 03:40.320
and we're not going anywhere

03:40.320 --> 03:43.022
till we blow the
whistle on the boss.

03:43.022 --> 03:46.192
Pig 2: Yeah, and by the time
she's finished embarrassing him,

03:46.192 --> 03:49.529
heh heh, the boss will
have to give us a raise!

03:49.529 --> 03:53.266
Pig 3: I don't know.
The boss isn't all that bad.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.867
Pig 1: That's not what you said

03:54.867 --> 03:57.971
when he had us slaving
in that factory.

03:59.205 --> 04:02.208
♪ (upbeat work music) ♪

04:14.220 --> 04:16.055
Pig 3: Ah! Oooh-ho-ho!

04:16.055 --> 04:19.125
Ho-ho-ho!

04:19.125 --> 04:21.194
Aaaaah!

04:21.194 --> 04:25.598
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

04:25.598 --> 04:29.168
Ho-ho-ho!

04:31.104 --> 04:33.072
Stop--that--bag!

04:33.072 --> 04:37.277
Pig 2: You're right. We've taken
enough abuse from the boss!

04:37.277 --> 04:40.079
Now we have a chance
to do something about it!

04:40.079 --> 04:43.049
Barbara LaFrum: Well, perhaps
I can be of some help.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.551
Hello boys, I'm Barbara LaFrum.

04:45.551 --> 04:48.888
Tell me all about
this Cyril Sneer.

04:50.156 --> 04:53.126
I've been thinking
about this bachelor auction.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.496
I need to think of
a really snazzy date.

04:56.496 --> 05:00.133
Something spectacular
and exciting.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.970
Ugh. I'm just not
that kind of guy.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.271
Oh, I don't know, Bert.

05:05.271 --> 05:08.241
Remember that
time out on the lake?

05:09.942 --> 05:11.110
Rrrrrrrgggggghhhhhh!

05:11.110 --> 05:13.212
There it is!
The monster!

05:13.212 --> 05:16.282
Aaaahhhhh!

05:22.488 --> 05:25.224
I got it! I got it!

05:25.224 --> 05:29.896
Ohhh it's got me! It's got me!

05:29.896 --> 05:32.098
Help me!

05:32.098 --> 05:35.835
Can you hear us?
Bert!...Bert!

05:35.835 --> 05:38.638
Yeehaa!
Look out!

05:38.638 --> 05:42.075
Yeehaa! Hoo hoo!
Whoa!

05:42.075 --> 05:43.976
Aaaaah-ha!

05:47.113 --> 05:49.749
Wow! What a ride!

05:49.749 --> 05:53.353
Yeah, I suppose I do
have my moments, Melissa.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.787
But let's face it,

05:54.787 --> 05:58.024
not every girl likes
riding around on monsters.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.792
Any luck with
your dad, Cedric?

05:59.792 --> 06:02.328
Not yet.
But I'll keep trying.

06:02.328 --> 06:05.164
Pig 3: No sign of
Barbara LaFrum.

06:05.164 --> 06:08.701
Pig 1: Maybe she thought we were
exaggerating about the boss

06:08.701 --> 06:11.537
and decided not to come.

06:12.572 --> 06:15.007
Pig 3: Yeow!
Pig 1/Pig 2: Yeow!

06:15.007 --> 06:17.944
Midas? I saw
you on Twenty Minutes.

06:17.944 --> 06:19.979
Bankrupt, eh? Ha.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.848
I'm willing to help you out.

06:21.848 --> 06:24.050
Pig 2:
Milton Midas... ruined?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.551
By Barbara LaFrum?

06:25.551 --> 06:27.387
But he's even richer
than the boss!

06:27.387 --> 06:30.490
Pig 1: Not any more. And
if she can do that to Midas,

06:30.490 --> 06:32.959
imagine what she'll
do to the boss.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.561
Ha. We'll be out of a job!

06:35.561 --> 06:37.563
Yes, I know
it's a family business

06:37.563 --> 06:39.198
and I intend to
keep it that way.

06:39.198 --> 06:41.667
Of course, you and your
family will have to go...

06:41.667 --> 06:43.403
Pigs?!

06:43.403 --> 06:44.504
Pig 3: Yes boss?

06:44.504 --> 06:46.105
Get the door, pronto!

06:46.105 --> 06:50.343
Pig 1: Um, we're a little
hung up at the moment, boss.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.479
I'll get back
to you Milton. Ciao.

06:53.479 --> 06:56.749
I don't know what
I pay those porkers for!

06:58.351 --> 06:59.752
Barbara LaFrum: Cyril Sneer?

06:59.752 --> 07:01.821
B-Barbara LaFrum?

07:01.821 --> 07:03.256
Wh-wh-what do you want?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.558
LaFrum: I want truth.
I want justice.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.360
And I want fair play.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.096
It's just up the
road... toodle-oo!

07:10.096 --> 07:11.764
This is it.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.567
I'm... I'm... doomed.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.371
I wonder
who'll bid on me?

07:18.371 --> 07:20.573
I hope we have
similar interests...

07:20.573 --> 07:24.277
like uh, stamp collecting, accounting...

07:24.277 --> 07:26.279
maybe even sculpture.

07:26.279 --> 07:30.249
I think I'd skip the
sculpture if I were you, Cedric.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.851
I happen
to think sculpture

07:31.851 --> 07:33.686
is very exciting, Bert.

07:33.686 --> 07:34.954
Oh yeah, it sure is.

07:34.954 --> 07:39.358
I still get the willies thinking
about your last major project.

07:39.358 --> 07:41.594
I've been meaning
to ask you Cedric,

07:41.594 --> 07:44.564
uh, what's it supposed
to be anyway?

07:44.564 --> 07:47.467
It represents the
progress of civilization

07:47.467 --> 07:49.469
through time and space.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.904
I call it... Life.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.975
So, heh heh,
that's life huh?

07:55.975 --> 07:58.744
Well hahaha.
It'll look a lot more like it

07:58.744 --> 08:00.213
when it's finished.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.482
If I ever get it finished.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.518
This darn thing is
acting up again.

08:05.518 --> 08:08.421
Hmm. I better go see
what's keeping Melissa.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.722
Okay Bert.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.025
Uaaaah!

08:15.127 --> 08:16.395
Cedric!!!

08:16.395 --> 08:18.264
Oh...

08:18.264 --> 08:20.333
Cedric, can you hear me?

08:20.333 --> 08:23.769
Cedric!!

08:25.571 --> 08:26.772
Cedric!!!

08:28.241 --> 08:30.643
Good boy, Snag. Atta boy!!

08:30.643 --> 08:32.245
Cedric?

08:32.245 --> 08:33.312
Oh no!

08:37.850 --> 08:41.120
Yeah that was
a real 'blast'
alright!

08:41.120 --> 08:44.223
I guess I'll stick with stamps.

08:44.223 --> 08:46.526
Stick with stamps... get it?

08:46.526 --> 08:49.061
Heh heh!
Ah, hahaha!

08:49.061 --> 08:52.999
Oh, gee Cedric...
that's the funniest thing

08:52.999 --> 08:54.967
I've heard all day. Ha.

08:54.967 --> 08:58.938
Hey, we need at leave five more
crates of peanut butter soda.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.473
Coming right up, Bert!

09:00.473 --> 09:03.209
Good evening...
the Blue Spruce Cafe.

09:03.910 --> 09:07.346
Cedric, can you take
the phone? It's your dad.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.483
Can you tell him
I'll call right back?

09:10.483 --> 09:12.818
Sorry
Mr. Sneer, he's tied up now,

09:12.818 --> 09:14.520
but he'll get right back to you.

09:14.887 --> 09:18.024
He does seem a
little tense, Cedric.

09:19.191 --> 09:23.262
Grrr! Aaah!
She's still out there!

09:23.262 --> 09:26.899
I've got to get to Cedric before
that shark of a journalist does.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.101
Pig 3: We'll help you, boss.

Pig 2: The boss can't shake
Barbara LaFrum for long.

11:25.084 --> 11:26.819
She's relentless!

11:26.819 --> 11:29.689
Pig 1: Then it's up to us
to throw her off the trail.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.191
Our jobs are on the line!

11:33.459 --> 11:35.361
Hmmm that's strange.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.363
I'm not expecting
any deliveries.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.165
Just put it in the storeroom.

11:39.165 --> 11:40.700
This way, guys.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.034
I'll
figure it out later.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.837
Ouch.

11:44.837 --> 11:45.838
Pop.

11:45.838 --> 11:47.707
Somebody
get me out of here.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.910
Ugh!

11:50.910 --> 11:54.513
Pop, you decided to come
to the auction after all!

11:54.513 --> 11:58.217
Forget it, son.
There's a snake out to get me!

11:58.217 --> 12:02.121
A snake by the name
of Barbara LaFrum.

12:02.121 --> 12:04.890
Wow! You're going
to be on Twenty Minutes?!

12:04.890 --> 12:07.860
Look son, if
Barbara LaFrum turns up,

12:07.860 --> 12:09.995
you never saw me, in fact,

12:09.995 --> 12:11.697
you never heard of me!

12:11.697 --> 12:12.832
Capeesh?

12:12.832 --> 12:15.267
Um... whatever
you say, Pop.

12:15.267 --> 12:18.137
Do you want me to nail
the lid on or anything?

12:18.904 --> 12:21.340
Barbara LaFrum: Good evening,
this is Barbara LaFrum,

12:21.340 --> 12:24.276
reporting from the home
of the notorious tycoon

12:24.276 --> 12:27.146
and wheeler dealer, Cyril Sneer.

12:27.146 --> 12:30.549
Pig 1: If we can convince
Barbara the boss is a good guy,

12:30.549 --> 12:32.084
she'll drop the story.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.688
Now smile... it's show time!

12:35.688 --> 12:37.923
Barbara LaFrum: Here we have
three of mister Sneer's

12:37.923 --> 12:40.059
downtrodden employees.

12:40.059 --> 12:43.095
Boys, just how bad
is Cyril Sneer?

12:43.095 --> 12:46.398
Pig 1: Cyril? Oh heck, he is

12:46.398 --> 12:49.068
the sweetest guy in the world.

12:49.068 --> 12:50.703
Pig 2: Oh yes.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.906
Pig 3: And we never have
to ask for a raise.

12:53.906 --> 12:56.142
Pig 2: The boss told us to
give you a guided missile...

12:56.142 --> 12:58.744
er... tour. Walk this way.

12:58.744 --> 13:01.947
Pig 1: The boss makes sure we
get our cake and eat it too.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.884
Oopss. Back off, Bruno!

13:04.884 --> 13:06.452
Uh, nice bear!

13:06.452 --> 13:09.421
Pig 2: We must remind the
boss to fix that squeak.

13:09.421 --> 13:10.422
Pig 1: Oink!

13:10.422 --> 13:14.460
Pig 3: Oh yess..we
work out almost daily.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.696
Pig 1: Right here in our own
personal private health spa.

13:17.696 --> 13:18.664
Ouch.

13:18.664 --> 13:20.733
He even forced this elegant,

13:20.733 --> 13:22.601
luxurious suite on us.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.503
Pig 2: We tried to stop him.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.972
Pig 3: Oh, what a guy.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.408
Barbara LaFrum: Hmm...
well I don't know

13:29.408 --> 13:31.544
how I could have been so wrong

13:31.544 --> 13:33.979
about Mr. Sneer. Good day.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.549
Pig 1: She bought it!

13:36.549 --> 13:38.384
Barbara LaFrum: Just
one more thing, boys.

13:38.384 --> 13:41.086
I really feel bad
about this whole affair.

13:41.086 --> 13:44.490
I wish I could apologize
to Mr. Sneer.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.660
You don't know where I
might find him, do you?

13:47.660 --> 13:50.763
Pig 3: He's at the
Blue Spruce Ca--fe.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.965
Barbara LaFrum: The Blue
Spruce Cafe, you say?

13:52.965 --> 13:56.235
Well, thank you boys,
you've been most helpful.

13:56.235 --> 14:01.140
Let's go get the real story
from Cyril Sneer himself!

14:02.441 --> 14:05.744
Lady Baden-Baden: Welcome to our
very special fundraising event

14:05.744 --> 14:08.747
for the Evergreen
touring orchestra.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.483
This evening, we'll
be auctioning off

14:11.483 --> 14:14.687
that rarest of all commodities.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.623
The eligible bachelor.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.258
Haha.

14:19.258 --> 14:22.328
Pop it's me.
The coast is clear.

14:22.328 --> 14:25.631
Why don't you come out and
take part in our auction?

14:25.631 --> 14:28.601
Not until that slug
Barbara LaFrum

14:28.601 --> 14:30.669
crawls back under her rock.

14:30.669 --> 14:35.174
Okay, Pop. There's a
sandwich in case you get hungry.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.775
Now without further ado,

14:36.775 --> 14:38.978
a classically engaging fellow,

14:38.978 --> 14:41.180
Mr. Cedric Sneer.

14:41.180 --> 14:45.684
Ahem... my date, uh,
will be treated to, uh.

14:45.684 --> 14:48.187
I see $50 from
Sophia Tutu already.

14:48.187 --> 14:50.189
Do I hear $60? $55, $55

14:50.189 --> 14:52.124
$55, $55...
Sheesh!

14:52.124 --> 14:54.827
Cedric's gonna be
a hard act to follow!

14:55.427 --> 14:56.662
Pig 2: Oh!

14:56.662 --> 14:59.565
Oooh. That short
cut was a killer, Lloyd.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.001
Pig 1: Yeah, but at
least we beat Barbara.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.369
Yeah.

15:03.369 --> 15:05.971
Going once. For the
chance of a lifetime.

15:05.971 --> 15:08.707
Scuba diving
followed by hot chocolate...

15:08.707 --> 15:10.142
going twice...

15:10.142 --> 15:12.945
Sold! To Sophia Tutu.

15:15.347 --> 15:19.351
And now, ladies for your
consideration, Schaeffer!

15:19.351 --> 15:21.420
Bon vivant, raconteur,

15:21.420 --> 15:24.390
and general all round nice guy.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.091
Tell us about your date?

15:26.091 --> 15:28.060
Um..we're going to
start with a gourmet

15:28.060 --> 15:31.063
cooking lesson... which
we'll... um... eat.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.098
Do I hear an
opening bid, ladies?

15:33.098 --> 15:35.701
Pig 1: I don't see
the boss anywhere.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.036
Huh?

15:37.036 --> 15:39.405
Pig 2: It's Barbara, what's her
name. Quick, take cover, guys.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.676
Pig 1: I don't think she saw us.

15:43.676 --> 15:47.346
If the boss finds out we set
him up for that barracuda,

15:47.346 --> 15:49.682
he'll throw us to the sharks!

15:50.249 --> 15:51.750
B..b..b..b..b..b.b.b.b.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.920
Boss!! You miserable
pig slops, I outta...

15:54.920 --> 15:57.690
Barbara LaFrum: You ought
to what, Mr. Sneer?

15:57.690 --> 15:59.425
Heh heh. I...um.

15:59.425 --> 16:04.063
I ought to give these... um fine
young fellows... um..a raise.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.465
Yes..that's it... a raise!

16:06.465 --> 16:08.801
Pig 3: Oh golly, gosh no boss.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.570
You'll take it
and you'll like it!

16:11.570 --> 16:14.173
Barbara LaFrum: I have a few
questions for you, Mr. Sneer.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.307
Come on ladies.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.209
Let's get those
donations up here.

16:17.209 --> 16:20.379
It's all for a good cause...
and now, heh

16:20.379 --> 16:22.548
Bert Raccoon!

16:22.548 --> 16:25.651
Thank you..thank you.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.486
Let me tell you
a little about him...

16:28.253 --> 16:30.756
Bert's a very thoughtful guy.

16:32.458 --> 16:33.659
Broo!

16:35.294 --> 16:36.929
He can't swim!

16:36.929 --> 16:38.964
He's always there
to help his friends

16:38.964 --> 16:41.166
through difficult situations.

17:02.621 --> 17:03.956
Ruff! ruff!

17:08.961 --> 17:11.263
Whenever Bert gets
the opportunity to travel,

17:11.263 --> 17:14.967
you don't have to ask him twice.
He'll leap at the chance.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.201
Woahaaaaa.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.469
I've got you, Bert.

17:17.469 --> 17:20.105
Uh-oh-oooh!

17:29.214 --> 17:34.186
Of course, Bert has his
quiet, reflective side too...

17:37.990 --> 17:40.292
Uh, thanks for that
introduction, Ralph.

17:40.292 --> 17:44.630
Ahm-ahm, exquisite is
the word for my date.

17:44.630 --> 17:48.167
A ten mile hike to the
summit of Frean's Peak,

17:48.167 --> 17:50.002
with a picnic feast.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.572
Peanut butter sandwiches,
peanut butter soda,

17:53.572 --> 17:57.342
peanut butter fudge brownies,
peanut butter--

17:57.342 --> 17:59.511
I think we've
got the idea, Bert.

17:59.511 --> 18:04.249
What am I bid for this uh,
peanut butter extravaganza?

18:06.685 --> 18:08.654
How about we start
with a dollar?

18:09.855 --> 18:11.523
Fifty cents?

18:11.523 --> 18:13.425
...absolute nonsense.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.260
Barbara LaFrum: Uh huh...
and what about the time

18:15.260 --> 18:18.030
you spent in jail? Cyril: Jail?!

18:18.030 --> 18:20.332
Barbara LaFrum:
Yes, jail, Mr. Sneer.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.606
Do you deny breaking through
the security system

18:27.606 --> 18:29.408
of the Knox mansion?

18:29.408 --> 18:31.076
Of course I do!

18:31.076 --> 18:33.545
I was just... I was lost.

18:33.545 --> 18:36.215
You know how mansions
are.. heh heh.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.616
They all look the same.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.426
Barbara LaFrum: Weren't you
caught, red-handed with the gem?

18:47.426 --> 18:48.894
Let me think.

18:48.894 --> 18:50.562
Um-um.. gem?

18:50.562 --> 18:52.397
Ummmmm gem...

18:52.397 --> 18:55.767
gem.. gem.. ummm. He-he.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.939
Oh no..!

19:00.939 --> 19:02.608
Barbara LaFrum:
Come now, Mr. Sneer,

19:02.608 --> 19:04.610
you can't deny everything.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.578
I'm innocent I tell you!

19:06.578 --> 19:09.148
Innocent!! The pigs
put me up to it!

19:09.148 --> 19:10.949
It's all their fault!

19:10.949 --> 19:13.619
I'm innocent!
Innocent I tell you!

19:13.619 --> 19:15.087
It was all a misunderstanding...

19:15.087 --> 19:17.623
when I stole the gem..no...
I didn't steal it...

19:17.623 --> 19:20.592
exactly..um..well, I...
let me put it this way.

19:20.592 --> 19:21.927
Ciao!!

19:23.095 --> 19:26.732
A buck fifty.
I raised a buck fifty.

19:26.732 --> 19:29.468
And it was very nice of
you to lend her the money, Bert.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.270
A buck fifty.

19:31.270 --> 19:34.139
I paid more for my pet lizard.

19:34.139 --> 19:36.642
We're way
below our goal, folks.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.278
Is there not another
bachelor in the house?

19:39.278 --> 19:41.914
Back off, Barbara,
I'm warning you...

19:41.914 --> 19:43.949
I'm dangerous when cornered.

19:43.949 --> 19:46.318
I have one more
question, Mr. Sneer.

19:46.318 --> 19:47.419
Aaarrggh.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.188
What?! Cyril?

19:49.188 --> 19:54.159
Cyril!! Ladies, our final
bachelor up for auction is

19:54.159 --> 19:56.528
Cyril Sneer!

19:56.528 --> 19:58.997
Now wait one
cotton picking minute!

19:58.997 --> 20:01.433
I don't have...
Pig 1: Boss, play along!

20:01.433 --> 20:04.036
This is your chance
to save yourself,

20:04.036 --> 20:05.771
and look good for Barbara.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.707
Alright Raccoon,
let's get on with it!

20:08.707 --> 20:10.876
What a sport!

20:10.876 --> 20:15.314
Okay Cyril, what is your
idea of a dream date.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.182
An evening in my vault?

20:17.182 --> 20:18.450
Barbara LaFrum: A dollar.
What?!

20:18.450 --> 20:20.852
Pig 1: We've got to put
him out of her price range.

20:20.852 --> 20:23.021
I'll throw
in a string of pearls!

20:23.021 --> 20:24.790
$20

20:24.790 --> 20:26.825
30, 40, 45..."

20:26.825 --> 20:28.293
Barbara LaFrum: $50

20:28.293 --> 20:30.128
Pig 1: He'll throw in ..a ...

20:30.128 --> 20:34.066
A world cruise..uh..down south.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.567
$2 0000

20:35.567 --> 20:39.071
Two and a half..three!
Four! Five! Ten?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.839
Ten thousand dollars?

20:40.839 --> 20:42.674
Oh, bless you!

20:42.674 --> 20:44.476
We did it,
Lady Baden-Baden,

20:44.476 --> 20:46.078
we're over the top!

20:46.078 --> 20:50.015
$10 000...
going once.. Going twice...

20:50.682 --> 20:53.485
And so the auction
was a smashing success,

20:53.485 --> 20:55.354
thanks to Cyril Sneer.

20:55.354 --> 20:58.557
And best of all, the dates
turned out to be great fun

20:58.557 --> 21:01.526
for everyone..well...
almost everyone.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.497
Leave me alone!

21:05.497 --> 21:07.899
Barbara LaFrum: Cyril, I paid
ten thousand and one dollars

21:07.899 --> 21:10.102
for this date and I'm
going to get your story

21:10.102 --> 21:11.870
whether you like it or not.

21:11.870 --> 21:15.574
You can't stay in there for the
rest of the week, now can you?

21:15.574 --> 21:16.842
You're right
there, Barbara.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.543
Barbara LaFrum: Cyril,
I know you're in there.

21:18.543 --> 21:22.281
So long,
LaFrum. Bon voyage.

21:24.850 --> 21:26.218
Pig 1: Aloha.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.290
Well, where to, boss?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.225
I paid
for a world cruise,

21:33.225 --> 21:35.060
and I'm going to get it.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.695
