WEBVTT

00:12.500 --> 00:14.500
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.533 --> 00:18.533
(Izzie) I HAD SEX LAST NIGHT
WITH THE WRONG PERSON.
THIS IS OUR SECRET, OKAY?

00:18.567 --> 00:20.767
GO 60 DAYS WITH NO SEX,
NO OTHER WOMEN.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.233
(Mark) IF I'M NOT HAVING SEX,
NEITHER ARE YOU.

00:22.267 --> 00:25.667
CHIEF RESIDENT?
THE ONE FIFTH YEAR RESIDENT
THAT RULES ALL RESIDENTS.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.500
I WENT TO THE BOARD THIS MORNING
AND TOLD 'EM I WAS RETIRING.

00:28.533 --> 00:31.333
(Derek) I CAME OUT HERE
TO BE CHIEF,

00:31.367 --> 00:33.600
AND MEREDITH COMPLICATES THAT.
SO I JUST HAVE TO PICK ONE?

00:33.633 --> 00:35.800
IF YOU DON'T PICK ONE,
THIS IS GONNA BE YOUR FACE

00:35.833 --> 00:37.433
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
MY NAME IS NOT AVA!

00:37.467 --> 00:39.633
YOU MADE IT UP!
IT'S NOT ME!

00:41.667 --> 00:44.567
***

00:48.633 --> 00:50.600
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS
WILL GET AN ACUTE APPY?

00:50.633 --> 00:53.433
(Meredith) AS INTERNS,
WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT--

00:53.467 --> 00:55.100
TO BECOME SURGEONS...
7.

00:55.133 --> 00:56.200
AND WE'LL DO ANYTHING
TO GET THERE.

00:56.233 --> 00:57.733
(Alex) WHAT ARE THE SIGNS
OF RESIDUAL EYE INFECTIONS?

00:57.767 --> 00:59.667
(Meredith) UH, PUS,
UH, REDNESS AND, UH, FEVER.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.567
SUFFER THROUGH KILLER EXAMS,
ENDURE 100-HOUR WEEKS,

01:01.600 --> 01:03.500
STAND FOR HOURS ON END
IN OPERATING ROOMS...

01:03.533 --> 01:05.733
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS
WILL GET HEART DISEASE?
5%.

01:05.767 --> 01:08.367
YOU NAME IT, WE'LL DO IT.
WHAT'S CONN'S SYNDROME?

01:08.400 --> 01:10.200
UH, W-WAIT, WAIT, I KNOW THIS.
(Izzie) OH, TICK TOCK, DUDE.

01:10.233 --> 01:12.133
UM...
CRACKING UNDER THE PRESSURE.

01:12.167 --> 01:14.667
NO. (laughs) UM...
HYPERCORTOLIS--CORTISOLISM!

01:14.700 --> 01:16.733
UNH-UNH. UNH-UNH. UH,
PRIMARY HYPERALDOSTERONISM.

01:16.767 --> 01:18.633
YES! OUT OF THE SEAT.
MY TURN.

01:18.667 --> 01:20.500
NO, IT'S MY TURN.
NO, IT IS NOT.

01:20.533 --> 01:22.733
UM, TRY THIS ONE.
YOU KNOW, I--

01:22.767 --> 01:24.600
WHITE SPONGE
WITH VANILLA BUTTERCREAM.
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I'M TRYING TO STUDY

01:24.633 --> 01:27.333
FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST
OF MY INTERN CAREER.

01:27.367 --> 01:29.267
I-I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR WEDDING CAKE.
WELL, JUST TRY IT.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.567
GO! GO!
UH, WHAT IS THE STRONGEST LAYER
OF THE SMALL BOWEL?

01:31.600 --> 01:33.167
FINE. YUMMY. GO.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.133
(softly) OH, DAMN IT,
DAMN IT, DAMN IT.

01:35.167 --> 01:36.467
IT IS NOT SNOT.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.067
SUBMUCOSA!
YES.

01:38.100 --> 01:40.100
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

01:40.133 --> 01:41.733
ARE YOU STUDYING
WITH THE WIFE'S CARDS?
WHAT CARDS?

01:41.767 --> 01:44.633
CALLIE WAS RANKED NUMBER ONE
IN HER YEAR AFTER THIS TEST.

01:44.667 --> 01:45.900
SHE HAS
LEGENDARY FLASH CARDS.

01:45.933 --> 01:48.600
WE DON'T NEED THE FLASH CARDS.
WE ARE INDEPENDENTLY BRILLIANT.

01:48.633 --> 01:51.267
DREAM TEAM.
(Cristina) YEAH, I'M GONNA HURL.
OUTTA THE SEAT.

01:51.300 --> 01:54.067
NO, MY TURN. I'M GONNA KICK
ALL YOUR ASSES.
OH, COME ON.

01:54.067 --> 01:55.833
THIS IS THE LEMON.
MIGHT BE A LITTLE TART.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.367
(Izzie) WHAT IS
ACTINIC KERATOSIS?

01:57.400 --> 01:59.333
UH... ACTINIC KERATOSIS IS,
UH, A PREMALIGNANT LESION.

01:59.367 --> 02:01.067
IN OLD PEOPLE.
IN ANYONE.

02:01.067 --> 02:02.533
TOO TART?

02:02.567 --> 02:05.833
I DON'T CARE.
I MEAN, IS ALEX RIGHT OR AM I?

02:05.867 --> 02:08.532
LEARN TO CARE,
OR I'LL GET ANOTHER BRIDE.

02:08.567 --> 02:11.067
I LOVE IT. I LOVE ALL CAKES.
NOW BREAK THE TIE.

02:11.100 --> 02:16.300
(sighs)

02:16.333 --> 02:18.067
KAREV'S RIGHT.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.300
OH, COME ON.
YES! WHOO-HOO-HOO!

02:19.333 --> 02:21.200
THE TOUGH PART, THOUGH,
IS RECONCILING

02:21.233 --> 02:23.533
THIS HUGE THING WE WANT--
TO BE SURGEONS--

02:23.567 --> 02:25.467
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE WE WANT.

02:25.500 --> 02:26.467
HEY.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.833
OH, HEY.

02:27.867 --> 02:29.767
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A FEW DAYS.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.267
I LEFT MESSAGES.
YEAH, I KNOW. I WAS JUST
TRYING TO--

02:32.300 --> 02:34.200
I KNOW I TOLD YOU
TO STOP HOVERING,

02:34.233 --> 02:36.100
AND YOU DID,
AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

02:36.133 --> 02:38.067
BUT NOW STOP
WITH THE STOPPING.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:38.067 --> 02:40.667
IT'S RIDICULOUS FOR ME TO
WORRY ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.567
IT'S SWEET THAT YOU WORRY.
MM-HMM.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.667
IT IS.
I SHOULD COMMUNICATE MORE.
RIGHT.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.567
YOU DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.
I CAN DO IT.
REALLY?

02:48.600 --> 02:50.500
IN A FEW SECONDS, I'LL BE
GETTING ON THAT ELEVATOR.

02:50.533 --> 02:52.433
AND THEN I'LL BE GOING
ON ROUNDS.
(elevator bell dings)

02:52.467 --> 02:53.633
OH.

02:53.667 --> 02:58.333
SEE, UH, I'M, UH,
GETTING ON THE ELEVATOR.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.200
COMMUNICATING.

03:00.233 --> 03:01.433
(chuckles)

03:01.467 --> 03:03.367
28 MORE DAYS AND...

03:03.400 --> 03:04.733
MM.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.667
THEN IT'S YOU AND ME
IN A LOCKED ROOM

03:06.700 --> 03:08.600
FOR A RECORD-BREAKING,
EARTH-SHATTERING,

03:08.633 --> 03:10.700
MIND-BLOWING--
OKAY! I GET IT.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.633
THANK YOU.
THAT WAS
LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC.

03:12.667 --> 03:15.267
I'M GONNA BE
MORE ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN WE...

03:15.300 --> 03:17.233
CROSS THE FINISH LINE.

03:17.267 --> 03:19.167
(elevator bell dings)
OKAY.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.067
JUST MAKING SURE YOU HAVEN'T
LOST INTEREST IN THE PROJECT.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.433
NOT AT ALL.

03:23.467 --> 03:25.733
GOOD.

03:36.567 --> 03:38.433
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:38.467 --> 03:41.267
THE BAKERY WANTS ME TO MAKE
A DECISION BY TOMORROW.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.400
SO IF YOU CAN TELL ME
YOUR FAVORITE BY THEN,

03:43.433 --> 03:46.100
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

03:48.833 --> 03:52.167
CAKES AND LITTLE PLACE CARDS?
OKAY, HE'S TURNING INTO A GIRL.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.400
I THINK IT'S SWEET. HE OBVIOUSLY
CARES ABOUT THIS STUFF.
THIS WHITE ONE
TASTE'S PRETTY GOOD.

03:54.433 --> 03:56.333
I SHOULD BRING A PIECE
TO DEREK, RIGHT?

03:56.367 --> 03:57.500
THAT'S WHAT
GOOD GIRLFRIEND'S DO,

03:57.533 --> 03:59.433
BRING THEIR BOYFRIEND'S CAKE
AND COMMUNICATE?

03:59.467 --> 04:01.467
NO. THE BEST ONES JUST KEEP
ALL THAT STUFF TO THEMSELVES.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.467
DID YOU BRING CALLIE'S CARDS?
UH, NO.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.333
OH, WELL, NO CAKE FOR YOU.
(Meredith) DR. BAILEY,

04:06.367 --> 04:08.800
I SAW A HEMIGLOSSECTOMY
ON THE BOARD. CAN I SCRUB IN?
NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE NOT
DOING SURGERIES TODAY.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.667
WHAT?
YOUR INTERN EXAMS
ARE IN TWO WEEKS.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.600
YOU NEED TO SPEND EVERY
AVAILABLE MINUTE

04:12.633 --> 04:14.733
STUDYING FOR THEM.
OH, BELIEVE ME,

04:14.767 --> 04:17.700
WHEN YOU WON'T HAVE TO REPEAT
YOUR YEAR AS INTERNS,

04:17.733 --> 04:20.333
YOU'LL BE THANKING ME
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

04:20.367 --> 04:24.200
SO, GREY AND YANG,
YOU'RE... DOING SCUT.

04:24.233 --> 04:25.467
O'MALLEY, STEVENS,
YOU'LL BE JOINING ME

04:25.500 --> 04:27.467
IN THE CLINIC.
KAREV, YOU'RE WITH AVA.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.067
UM, I DON'T ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE ON HER CASE.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.833
SOMEONE ELSE CAN HAVE HER.

04:30.867 --> 04:33.367
OR NOT.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.467
(George) SO...

04:34.500 --> 04:36.167
LAST NIGHT
WE STUDIED TOGETHER.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.267
TODAY WE'RE, UH,
TREATING PATIENTS TOGETHER.

04:38.300 --> 04:39.633
AND WE'RE FINE.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.433
WE'RE NOT TORTURED,
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

04:41.467 --> 04:44.100
WE MADE A MISTAKE
AND WE'VE MOVED ON.

04:44.133 --> 04:46.300
IF ANYTHING, I THINK IT BRINGS
US CLOSER TOGETHER AS FRIENDS.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.100
WE'RE VERY IMPRESSIVE.

04:48.133 --> 04:50.533
I THINK WE ARE.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.667
LARRY JENNINGS JUST CHECKED IN
TO THE HOSPITAL.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.600
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

04:56.633 --> 04:58.433
HIS ASSISTANT SAID

04:58.467 --> 05:01.333
IT WAS A MATTER
OF THE UTMOST DISCRETION.
OH, THAT'S NEVER GOOD.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.233
YEAH, WHATEVER IT IS,
IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH

05:03.267 --> 05:05.167
FOR HIM TO CUT SHORT
HIS VACATION AND FLY HOME.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.100
I WANT YOU
ON POINT ON THIS ONE.

05:07.133 --> 05:09.067
NO CLINIC TODAY.
OH, I CAN DO BOTH.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.100
MIRANDA, WE ARE TALKING

05:10.133 --> 05:12.167
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
OF SEATTLE GRACE HOSPITAL.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.100
THE CLINIC WILL SURVIVE
WITHOUT YOU FOR A DAY.

05:14.133 --> 05:16.067
LEARN TO DELEGATE.
WELL, WHO AM I
SUPPOSED TO DELEGATE TO?

05:16.067 --> 05:18.433
CHIEF WEBBER,
YOU PAGED ME?

05:18.467 --> 05:20.733
SYDNEY HERON
REPORTING FOR DUTY.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.100
(Ava) HEY.

05:27.067 --> 05:29.767
I WAS WONDERING IF I WAS
GONNA SEE YOU TODAY.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.667
WHERE YOU BEEN?
JUST GETTING MY ASSIGNMENTS.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.600
YEAH, ANYTHING GOOD?

05:33.633 --> 05:34.800
ANYTHING AS GOOD

05:34.833 --> 05:36.733
AS A CRAZILY HORMONAL
PREGNANT AMNESIAC

05:36.767 --> 05:38.833
WITH A TENDENCY TO YELL
AT THE WRONG PEOPLE?

05:38.867 --> 05:40.833
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE'S HIGHER
THAN IT SHOULD BE.

05:40.867 --> 05:42.767
SO WHAT,
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.467
FINE.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.267
THEN I WON'T TELL YOU ABOUT
DR. MONTGOMERY'S SEX BET...

05:47.300 --> 05:49.167
WITH THE OVERLY HOT
DR. SLOAN.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.100
YEAH. IF HE CAN GO
60 DAYS WITHOUT SEX,

05:51.133 --> 05:53.067
THEY'RE GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

05:53.067 --> 05:55.100
APPARENTLY THEY USED TO BE
A THING

05:55.133 --> 05:56.833
BACK WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
TO DR. McDREAMY.

05:56.867 --> 05:59.067
THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO YOU
KNOW ALL THAT?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.800
I'M ON BED REST 5 FEET
FROM THE NURSES' STATION,

06:00.833 --> 06:02.733
AND I HAVE EXCELLENT HEARING.
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

06:02.767 --> 06:04.400
IT'S LIKE--IT'S LIKE
WATCHING A SOAP.

06:04.433 --> 06:06.333
DO--DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY DOCTORS
IN THIS HOSPITAL

06:06.367 --> 06:07.767
NURSE OLIVIA HAS SLEPT WITH?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.700
OH, WAIT. WHO AM I TALKING TO?
YOU'RE ONE OF 'EM.

06:09.733 --> 06:11.633
ANYWAY, I'D STRONGLY ADVISE YOU
TO MOVE ON DR. MONTGOMERY

06:11.667 --> 06:14.300
BEFORE YOU LOSE YOUR SHOT,
OR I WOULD IF WE WERE FRIENDS.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.300
SO IF SHE WANTS TO BE
WITH SLOAN...

06:16.333 --> 06:18.133
DUDE... IF SHE WANTED
TO BE WITH SLOAN,

06:18.167 --> 06:19.733
SHE'D BE WITH SLOAN.

06:19.767 --> 06:22.633
THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS HAVE
A SAY IN WHO GETS TO BE CHIEF,

06:22.667 --> 06:24.567
BUT LARRY--HE'S THE ONE
WHO REALLY DECIDES, OKAY?

06:24.600 --> 06:26.167
HE KNOWS IT,
AND THEY KNOW IT.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.400
SO IF THE ATTENDINGS
FIND OUT HE'S HERE--
THE MAN WON'T GET
A MOMENT'S PEACE.

06:29.433 --> 06:31.467
(Preston, Addison and Derek
all talking at once)

06:31.500 --> 06:34.333
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE NOW. I WANT
YOU ALL OUT OF HERE, OKAY?

06:34.367 --> 06:36.267
(cell phone ringing)
LOOK, GO, GO, GO. OUT.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.200
ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND ME.

06:38.233 --> 06:40.300
CHIEF WEBBER? CELESTE.
LARRY'S ASSISTANT. HE'S IN HERE.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.233
OKAY. GO AWAY.
BUT WE CAN HELP.

06:42.267 --> 06:44.167
"WE" CAN HELP?
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

06:44.200 --> 06:46.633
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY WOMAN PARTS.
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.433
(Addison) IRRELEVANT.
(Mark) RIGHT. WE'D JUST
COME BACK ANYWAY.

06:48.467 --> 06:49.633
(Derek) RIGHT.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.667
RICHARD. FINALLY.

06:51.700 --> 06:55.333
OH, FOR GOD SAKE. WHAT ARE
THE FOUR MUSKETEERS DOING HERE?

06:55.367 --> 06:57.267
WHAT HAPPENED TO
"I'LL BE DISCREET"?

06:57.300 --> 06:59.200
LARRY, THEY'RE HERE
FOR THE SAME REASON I AM,

06:59.233 --> 07:00.700
TO SEE IF THEY CAN HELP.

07:00.733 --> 07:01.767
RIGHT. BUNCH OF GHOULS.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.733
ALL RIGHT, ONE OF YOU
WANTS TO BE THE NEW CHIEF...

07:04.767 --> 07:06.100
(unzips zipper)

07:06.133 --> 07:07.500
(grunts)

07:07.533 --> 07:09.600
FIX THIS...

07:09.633 --> 07:11.067
AND YOU GOT MY VOTE.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.567
AND, NO,
THOSE ARE NOT GRAPEFRUITS.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.367
WELL...

07:18.400 --> 07:21.267
LOOKS AS THOUGH YOU WON'T BE
NEEDING MY SERVICES AFTER ALL.

07:21.300 --> 07:23.300
(clears throat)

07:32.567 --> 07:34.100
(groans)

07:34.133 --> 07:36.167
(Miranda)
AND SUPRAPUBIC TENDERNESS.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.767
THAT'S BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
TAKEN A LEAK IN THREE DAYS.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.133
THREE DAYS.
(Preston) COULD BE A HERNIA.

07:41.167 --> 07:42.733
A HERNIA WOULDN'T DO THAT.

07:42.767 --> 07:44.100
WAS THERE TRAUMA?

07:44.133 --> 07:47.400
TESTICULAR TORSION,
UH, YOU KNOW, TWISTING?

07:47.433 --> 07:50.200
TWISTING? YOU'D HAVE TO
TIE HIM IN A TRIPLE KNOT

07:50.233 --> 07:51.467
TO GET THAT KIND OF
FLUID BUILDUP.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.167
AM I WRONG?

07:53.200 --> 07:55.367
I WAS TAKING A 2-WEEK RAFT RIDE
DOWN THE AMAZON.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.300
OH. MAYBE IT'S
A TROPICAL DISEASE.
MM.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.067
SCHISTOSOMIASIS?
FILARIASIS?

07:59.067 --> 08:01.133
WELL, NOW THEY'RE JUST GUESSING.
RICHARD!

08:01.167 --> 08:03.800
DR. BAILEY, CALL DR. FISCHER
IN UROLOGY

08:03.833 --> 08:05.133
TO DO A SUPRAPUBIC CATH

08:05.167 --> 08:07.400
AN ORDER AN ULTRASOUND
AND K.U.B.

08:07.433 --> 08:09.433
LARRY, HAVE YOU CALLED NANCY?

08:11.467 --> 08:14.333
I DON'T WANT TO WORRY MY WIFE
UNLESS I HAVE TO.

08:14.367 --> 08:18.100
SHE WASN'T ON THE TRIP
WITH YOU?

08:18.133 --> 08:20.133
WHITE CHOCOLATE WITH...

08:20.167 --> 08:21.500
HMM, BUTTERCREAM.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.067
DR. MONTGOMERY.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.267
HMM? I CAN'T DECIDE.

08:25.300 --> 08:28.467
TRIPLE BERRY AT LEAST HAS FRUIT,
SO I COULD PRETEND IT'S HEALTHY.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.767
YEAH, AVA'S B.P.
IS 171 OVER 118.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.799
SHE'S PREECLAMPTIC.
YEAH, I ORDERED BLOOD TESTS

08:32.832 --> 08:34.732
AND A BIOPHYSICAL PROFILE
ON THE BABY.

08:34.767 --> 08:37.167
IT WAS FINE, BUT, UH,
AVA'S GOT EDEMA.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.500
GET HER ON MAG
AND HYDRALAZINE.
WHAT ABOUT AN EPIDURAL
TO GET HER BLOOD PRESSURE DOWN?

08:40.533 --> 08:43.533
I MEAN,
AM I GOING OVERBOARD OR--
BELIEVE ME,

08:43.567 --> 08:45.100
I WISH I HAD SOMEONE

08:45.133 --> 08:47.067
WHO CARED THAT MUCH
ABOUT MY BLOOD PRESSURE.

08:47.067 --> 08:50.600
YEAH, WELL, FROM WHAT I HEAR,
IN 28 DAYS YOU WILL.

08:52.133 --> 08:55.133
I'VE HAD A COLD,
LIKE FOREVER.

08:55.167 --> 08:57.500
AND I'VE BEEN HERE
THREE TIMES,

08:57.533 --> 08:59.667
AND THEY KEEP TELLING ME
IT'S GONNA GO AWAY,

08:59.700 --> 09:01.600
BUT MY NOSE
JUST WON'T STOP RUNNING.

09:01.633 --> 09:04.367
I'M LIKE THE MOST DISGUSTING
FOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.300
SOMETIMES THESE THINGS
JUST DRAG ON.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.233
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO
WAIT IT OUT.
NO, I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE.

09:08.267 --> 09:10.167
SEE, THERE'S, UH,
THERE'S A GIRL,

09:10.200 --> 09:12.067
AND WE'VE BEEN OUT
A FEW TIMES,

09:12.067 --> 09:13.800
AND NOW IT'S GOTTEN
TO THE POINT

09:13.833 --> 09:15.700
WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO,
YOU KNOW, SEAL THE DEAL.

09:15.733 --> 09:19.067
BUT THE NOSE THING IS SO GROSS,
I CAN'T GET ANYWHERE NEAR HER.

09:19.067 --> 09:20.800
WELL, I'M SURE IF SHE'S
REALLY INTO YOU,

09:20.833 --> 09:22.567
SHE'LL HANG IN THERE.
NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.467
I MEAN,
HAVE YOU EVER MET SOMEONE

09:24.500 --> 09:27.233
WHERE THE ATTRACTION
WAS SO INTENSE,

09:27.267 --> 09:29.167
YOU THOUGHT
IT MAY JUST KILL YOU?

09:29.200 --> 09:31.133
LIKE YOU'RE IN THE SAME ROOM,
AND YOUR SKIN IS ON FIRE.

09:31.167 --> 09:33.333
YOU WANT TO TOUCH 'EM SO BAD,
IT'S LIKE--
YEAH, OKAY, WE GET IT.

09:33.367 --> 09:35.067
WE'RE... ON THE CASE.

09:35.067 --> 09:36.767
YES, I WILL DO AN E.N.T.,

09:36.800 --> 09:39.533
AND YOU WILL LISTEN
TO HIS, UH...
CHEST.

09:39.567 --> 09:41.067
YES.
I'M ON IT.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.600
WHICH FLUID RESUSCITATION
TECHNIQUE

09:42.633 --> 09:44.533
IS USED IN ACUTE BURNS?

09:44.567 --> 09:47.133
THE PARKLAND FORMULA.
COME ON, MER. STEP IT UP.

09:47.167 --> 09:49.200
WHAT IS VIRCHOW'S TRIAD?
OH, I HATE GEORGE.

09:49.233 --> 09:51.067
HE MARRIED INTO THE CARDS.

09:51.067 --> 09:53.733
YOU THINK HE KNEW? YOU THINK
THAT'S WHY HE MARRIED HER?

09:53.767 --> 09:55.667
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
HE MARRIED HER.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.333
WE NEED THOSE CARDS.
WE DON'T NEED THE CARDS.

09:58.367 --> 10:00.133
WHAT IS VIRCHOW'S TRIAD?
DR. TORRES.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.067
UM, DR. BURKE AND I ARE TRYING
TO CHOOSE A WEDDING CAKE,

10:02.100 --> 10:03.833
AND THERE ARE SOME SAMPLES
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

10:03.867 --> 10:07.200
IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT, I WOULD
REALLY LOVE YOUR OPINION,

10:07.233 --> 10:09.133
BECAUSE, I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT
SUCH GREAT TASTE.

10:09.167 --> 10:10.367
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
MY CARDS, YANG.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.300
DR. BAILEY...
NEED AN INTERN?

10:12.333 --> 10:14.767
UH, YEAH. HOW'S IT GOING
IN THE CLINIC, O'MALLEY?

10:14.800 --> 10:17.433
HOW'S SYDNEY DOING?

10:17.467 --> 10:20.333
OH, THAT'S W-WHY YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME,

10:20.367 --> 10:22.267
TO FIND OUT
HOW THINGS WERE GOING?

10:22.300 --> 10:24.167
I-I--SHE'S--

10:24.200 --> 10:25.533
DR. BAILEY, UM--
WELL--

10:25.567 --> 10:27.467
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

10:27.500 --> 10:28.800
OH, OF COURSE,
MS. NEWMAN.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.733
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

10:30.767 --> 10:32.667
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.467
UM, MORTIFYING, ACTUALLY.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.533
UM...

10:36.567 --> 10:38.433
I THINK I NEED
TO BE TESTED.

10:38.467 --> 10:41.567
LARRY AND I--
WHATEVER LARRY HAS,

10:41.600 --> 10:44.300
I PROBABLY HAVE IT
AS WELL.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.067
UH, O'MALLEY.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.433
YEAH.
PAGE DR. MONTGOMERY.

10:47.467 --> 10:49.233
OKAY.
OKAY.

10:49.267 --> 10:52.133
HOW'S IT GOING,
BUDDY BUD?

10:52.167 --> 10:54.067
(sighs) I'M GETTING
A STREP CULTURE ON BED NINE

10:54.100 --> 10:56.233
AND DISCHARGING MR. BENTON.
THE GENTLEMAN
WITH THE SINUS ISSUES?

10:56.267 --> 10:58.533
IT'S A RUNNY NOSE, AND I HAVE
A TEST TO STUDY FOR,

10:58.567 --> 11:01.467
AND BAILEY DOESN'T LIKE US
TO CLOG UP THE CLINIC--
AH, BAILEY'S
NOT HERE TODAY, OKAY? I AM.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.300
AND IT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD
TO OPEN A CLINIC

11:03.333 --> 11:05.233
AS SOME KIND OF POWER PLAY
FOR CHIEF RESIDENT,

11:05.267 --> 11:07.400
BUT CHIEF RESIDENT ISN'T REALLY
ABOUT BIG THINK.

11:07.433 --> 11:10.167
IT'S ABOUT
PATIENT CARE, OKAY?

11:10.200 --> 11:13.067
SO LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO
IMPROVE MR. BENTON'S EXPERIENCE.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.700
IT'S JUST A COLD.
NASAL LAVAGE.

11:15.733 --> 11:17.833
BECAUSE WE CARE.
NASAL LAVAGE?

11:17.867 --> 11:19.800
GET YOURSELF A BULB SYRINGE,
SQUEEZE AN ISOTONIC SOLUTION

11:19.833 --> 11:21.733
INTO ONE OF
MR. BENTON'S NOSTRILS.

11:21.767 --> 11:24.367
IT'LL SQUIRT RIGHT OUT THE OTHER
SIDE. INCREDIBLY RESTORATIVE.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.533
RINSE AND REPEAT.
RINSE AND REPEAT.

11:26.567 --> 11:29.367
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.267
I-I MEAN, IT IS. IT'S, UH...
IT'S JUST NOT AN AFFAIR.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.500
THOUGH, I GUESS TECHNICALLY
IT IS.

11:34.533 --> 11:35.767
BUT WE'RE IN LOVE.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.300
THE, UH, THE KIND OF LOVE YOU
THINK YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FIND,

11:39.333 --> 11:41.733
AND THEN YOU DO AND...
THE FACT THAT HE'S MARRIED

11:41.767 --> 11:44.633
SEEMS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
FOR BEING HAPPY, YOU KNOW?

11:44.667 --> 11:46.700
AT LEAST, MOST OF THE TIME.
BUT THEN FIVE YEARS GO BY,

11:46.733 --> 11:49.267
AND HE STILL HASN'T LEFT
HIS WIFE.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.200
AND YOU MUST THINK
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

11:51.233 --> 11:52.467
NO, NO.
(George) NO.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.133
NO JUDGMENT WHATSOEVER.
NO, NO.

11:54.167 --> 11:56.367
I MEAN, I KNOW I SHOULD
LEAVE HIM, IT'S JUST...

11:56.400 --> 11:58.300
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW RARE IT IS

11:58.333 --> 12:01.067
TO FIND SOMEONE YOU CAN WORK
AND PLAY WITH?

12:01.067 --> 12:02.767
AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.067
HOW WRONG CAN IT BE?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.600
(groans)

12:07.633 --> 12:09.533
RICHARD, THIS THING
STILL HURTS LIKE HELL,

12:09.567 --> 12:11.467
AND MY BOYS HERE
ARE NOT GETTING ANY SMALLER.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.400
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING ABOUT IT.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.333
WELL, THE UROLOGIST
JUST DRAINED YOUR BLADDER.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.267
NEXT STEP IS AN ULTRASOUND
AND AN X-RAY.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.200
THE INTERNS WILL BE
TAKING YOU UP QUICKLY.

12:19.233 --> 12:21.133
NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:21.167 --> 12:23.067
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING FOR ME?

12:23.067 --> 12:24.800
GETTING SOME OF
THE BEST SURGEONS IN THE WORLD

12:24.833 --> 12:26.500
TO HELP YOU.

12:26.533 --> 12:28.667
I CAME HERE FOR YOU.
YOU.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.600
YOU'RE THE BEST SURGEON
IN THIS PLACE,

12:31.633 --> 12:33.633
AT LEAST YOU USED TO BE.

12:33.667 --> 12:36.400
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, LARRY?

12:36.433 --> 12:39.067
AM I NOT TAKING
GOOD ENOUGH CARE OF YOU?

12:39.067 --> 12:42.733
HOW DOES A MAN LOSE HIS
DESIRE AT 53, 54,

12:42.767 --> 12:44.100
HOWEVER OLD YOU ARE?

12:44.133 --> 12:46.067
HOW DOES--
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

12:46.067 --> 12:48.533
I HAVEN'T, OKAY? THERE ARE
OTHER THINGS IN LIFE.

12:48.567 --> 12:49.667
LIKE WHAT,
ADELE LEAVING YOU?

12:49.700 --> 12:52.100
EVEN MORE REASON TO KEEP
THE JOB. YOU'RE A SURGEON, MAN.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.633
I HAVE TO GO SKINNY-DIPPING
IN THE AMAZON

12:54.667 --> 12:57.533
TO GET THAT KIND OF A THRILL.
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU BROWBEAT
ME INTO KEEPING THIS JOB.

12:57.567 --> 12:59.233
LIKE I'D EVEN WANT TO
AT THIS POINT.

12:59.267 --> 13:01.100
WHEN I APPOINTED YOU
CHIEF OF SURGERY,

13:01.133 --> 13:03.067
YOU WERE HUNGRY,
YOU WERE THE MAN.

13:03.067 --> 13:04.800
NOW YOU'RE A POLITICIAN,
GIVING ME EXCUSES,

13:04.833 --> 13:06.067
HANDING THINGS OFF.

13:06.100 --> 13:10.100
I HATE TO THINK THAT'S THE KIND
OF DOCTOR THAT YOU'VE BECOME,

13:10.133 --> 13:13.667
BUT IF IT IS, MAYBE IT IS BEST
THAT YOU'RE STEPPING DOWN.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.467
LOOK, I KNOW I SAID
YOU COULD USE THE DAY TO STUDY,

13:21.500 --> 13:23.367
BUT WE'VE GOT AN ALL-HANDS-
ON-DECK SITUATION.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.833
A-A BAD CAR ACCIDENT?
MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS?

13:25.867 --> 13:27.700
A PENIS. THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE BOARD'S PENIS.

13:27.733 --> 13:29.667
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

13:29.700 --> 13:31.333
HIS TESTICLES HAVE SWOLLEN,

13:31.367 --> 13:34.767
WHICH IS THE UNDERSTATEMENT
OF THE YEAR.
FANTASTIC. HOW MUCH?

13:34.800 --> 13:36.767
NO, YOU KNOW, DON'T TELL ME.
LET IT BE A SURPRISE.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.367
LOOK, YOU AND GREY CAN
TAKE HIM FOR HIS ULTRASOUND

13:39.400 --> 13:41.100
AND HIS X-RAY.
THE V.I.PENIS.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.767
JUST GO.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.633
(typing)

13:45.667 --> 13:47.567
ELEPHANTIASIS?
MM.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.733
NO WAY JENNINGS HAS THAT.
DID YOU CHECK FOR BRUCELLOSIS?

13:49.767 --> 13:51.733
IT COULD BE
FOURNIER'S GANGRENE.

13:51.767 --> 13:53.467
I DON'T KNOW.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.367
I'D GO TO GONORRHEA
BEFORE I WENT THERE.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.300
THEN AGAIN, I'LL BE THERE
AT THE FINISH LINE

13:57.333 --> 13:59.667
TO MAKE HIM PRETTY,
WHICH IS WHAT HE'LL REMEMBER.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.600
(chuckles)
OH, UH, DEREK.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.533
MM-HMM.
GREY WANTED ME TO TELL YOU

14:03.567 --> 14:05.467
THAT SHE'S STILL WORKING
ON JENNINGS' X-RAY,

14:05.500 --> 14:08.333
AND THAT SHE'LL BE IN THE, UH,
X-RAY VIEWING ROOM.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.667
GOOD TO KNOW.
SHE'S COMMUNICATING.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.600
JUST WHEN I NEED TIME
TO THINK,

14:12.633 --> 14:14.400
SHE SUDDENLY
STARTS COMMUNICATING.

14:14.433 --> 14:15.600
TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT?

14:15.633 --> 14:17.300
ALL OF IT--

14:17.333 --> 14:19.233
THE RELATIONSHIP,
THE CHIEF THING,

14:19.267 --> 14:21.167
HOW TO JUGGLE BOTH
WITHOUT GETTING DISTRACTED.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.333
WITH CRISTINA,
I HAVE TO BE EXPLICIT.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.267
THERE WOULD BE NO WEDDING
IF I WASN'T.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.800
OH, IT'S THAT EASY, HUH?

14:26.833 --> 14:30.100
OH, NO.
I NEVER SAID IT WAS EASY.

14:30.133 --> 14:32.833
RIGHT.

14:32.867 --> 14:36.167
***

14:40.200 --> 14:41.267
HEY.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.733
HEY. HOW'S IT GOING?

14:43.767 --> 14:45.333
(sighs) I, UH,

14:45.367 --> 14:47.833
CAUGHT GEORGE IN A LIE
THE OTHER DAY.

14:47.867 --> 14:50.267
HE SAID HE SPENT
THE DAY IN THE CLINIC

14:50.300 --> 14:51.800
WHEN HE SPENT IT

14:51.833 --> 14:53.733
DOING GOD KNOWS WHAT
WITH IZZIE STEVENS.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.633
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING,
RIGHT?

14:55.667 --> 14:56.700
RIGHT.

14:56.733 --> 14:57.667
RIGHT.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.367
SO HOW'S YOUR MAN-WHORE?

14:59.400 --> 15:00.333
(chuckles)

15:00.367 --> 15:01.600
MIRACULOUSLY REFORMED?

15:01.633 --> 15:04.433
(sighs) FOR NOW.

15:04.467 --> 15:06.467
THAT'S NEVER GONNA
TURN HIM INTO... (sighs)

15:06.500 --> 15:08.400
WHAT I WANT.
WHICH IS?

15:08.433 --> 15:10.200
THE WHOLE THING.

15:10.233 --> 15:12.733
I WANT SOMEONE STABLE
WHO BARBECUES

15:12.767 --> 15:15.367
AND TEACHES LITTLE KIDS
HOW TO PLAY CATCH.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.100
THAT'S NOT MARK SLOAN.

15:17.133 --> 15:20.433
WHICH DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY
I SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY

15:20.467 --> 15:24.300
LOOKING AT ALEX KAREV
LIKE A PUPPY AT A CHEW TOY.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.600
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO THERE ALREADY?

15:26.633 --> 15:28.300
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
BARBECUE EITHER.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.233
PLUS,
HE'S LIKE 12 YEARS OLD.

15:30.267 --> 15:32.600
HE COULD FIT ALL OF
HIS BELONGINGS IN A MILK CRATE.

15:32.633 --> 15:34.533
I DON'T KNOW.
GUYS LIKE KAREV...

15:34.567 --> 15:38.067
LOOK, AT LEAST YOU KNOW
HE'LL NEVER LIE TO YOU.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.700
GUYS LIKE HIM, THEY...

15:39.733 --> 15:41.633
THEY MESS AROUND IN THEIR 20s,

15:41.667 --> 15:44.300
BUT THEN THEY, YOU KNOW,
PACK IT IN

15:44.333 --> 15:46.233
AND TEACH THEIR KIDS
TO PLAY CATCH.

15:46.267 --> 15:47.467
MAYBE.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.533
UGH! I NEED TO STOP THINKING
ABOUT BOTH OF THEM.

15:49.567 --> 15:52.067
AND I HAVE TO STOP THINKING
ABOUT IZZIE STEVENS.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.600
HEY, CALLIE...

15:54.633 --> 15:55.833
HERE'S THE THING,

15:55.867 --> 15:58.500
WHEN YOU'RE OBSESSING
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

15:58.533 --> 16:01.367
THERE'S GENERALLY A REASON.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.300
***

16:06.767 --> 16:09.500
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

16:09.533 --> 16:11.567
(Izzie) NASAL LAVAGE.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.767
WHY?

16:13.800 --> 16:16.667
BECAUSE SHE'S TRYING
TO KILL ME.
SYDNEY.

16:16.700 --> 16:19.633
DR. BAILEY, WE'VE REALLY
TURNED THIS PLACE AROUND TODAY.

16:19.667 --> 16:22.767
NASAL LAVAGE?
FOUR VISITS IN ONE MONTH?

16:22.800 --> 16:25.100
OH, ARE YOU QUESTIONING
MY PATIENT CARE?

16:25.133 --> 16:27.067
MIRANDA, I GET IT, OKAY?
YOU'RE PROTECTING YOUR TURF.

16:27.067 --> 16:29.267
VERY MAMA BEAR.
VERY CHIEF RESIDENT.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.200
BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT
HOSPITAL POLITICS, OKAY?

16:31.233 --> 16:32.567
THIS IS ABOUT THE PATIENT.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.133
THE PATIENT CAN GO HOME.
GET THAT STUFF OUT OF HIS NOSE.

16:35.167 --> 16:37.467
NO, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
DISCHARGING HIM

16:37.500 --> 16:39.433
UNTIL WE'VE ADDRESSED
HIS PROBLEM.

16:39.467 --> 16:41.667
THE 16 PATIENTS
IN THE WAITING ROOM

16:41.700 --> 16:43.167
AREN'T COMFORTABLE EITHER.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.533
SIR, I... (sighs)

16:44.567 --> 16:46.633
I-I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN DO.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.333
YOU KNOW, COLDS DRAG ON.

16:48.367 --> 16:49.833
YEAH. YEAH, I HEAR YOU.

16:49.867 --> 16:51.500
(grunts)

16:51.533 --> 16:53.567
OH.
OH, HELL.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.700
WHAT?

16:54.733 --> 16:57.333
THAT COME OUT OF HIS NOSE?

16:57.367 --> 17:01.167
SEE? THIS IS WHY I'M NEVER
GONNA HAVE SEX AGAIN.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.633
UH, WAIT RIGHT HERE.

17:03.667 --> 17:06.700
UM, ORDER A HEAD C.T.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.067
WHY? IT'S NOT A COLD?

17:09.067 --> 17:12.067
NO, DR. STEVENS.
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A COLD.

17:18.532 --> 17:20.067
HEY, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

17:20.067 --> 17:22.367
I'LL BE OVER HERE
WHILE YOU'RE OVER THERE, OKAY?

17:22.400 --> 17:23.433
CUTE.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.133
EASY TO LOCATE, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

17:25.166 --> 17:27.067
GIRLFRIEND COMES WITH
A G.P.S.

17:27.099 --> 17:28.166
HMM.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.067
LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND
OF FOREIGN OBJECT.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.433
OUCH.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.767
(Preston)
THAT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE...

17:32.800 --> 17:34.700
A SKELETON.
IT'S SKELETON-LIKE.

17:34.733 --> 17:37.067
DEFINITELY SKELETONY.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.400
ARE THOSE BARBS?

17:38.433 --> 17:39.767
NO. CAN'T BE.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.467
WELL, IT COULD BE.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.600
IT LOOKS LIKE A TEENY,
TINY CATFISH.

17:43.633 --> 17:46.733
MM.
THAT'S CLOSE.

17:46.767 --> 17:50.233
YOU SEE THERE?
THOSE ARE SPINES.

17:50.267 --> 17:52.100
THIS IS A CANDIRU FISH.

17:52.133 --> 17:53.467
THE PENIS FISH?

17:53.500 --> 17:56.100
THIS GUY
HAS THE PENIS FISH...

17:56.133 --> 17:59.067
IN HIS... IN HIS...
WOW.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.300
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO TO ME?

18:01.333 --> 18:03.233
YOU KNOW, MOST PREGNANT
LABORING WOMEN

18:03.267 --> 18:04.600
LOVE THEIR EPIDURALS.

18:04.633 --> 18:06.133
I'M NOT IN LABOR.

18:06.167 --> 18:07.800
I'M TRYING TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY.

18:07.833 --> 18:09.700
BY PARALYZING ME
FROM THE WAIST DOWN?

18:09.733 --> 18:11.833
I CAN'T EVEN SIT UP
IN THE BED.

18:11.867 --> 18:14.767
I'M MISSING THE SHOW--
THE SEATTLE GRACE SHOW.
I CAN HELP WITH THAT.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.700
SO I GUESS YOU'RE
TALKING TO ME AGAIN.

18:16.733 --> 18:19.067
WELL, I CAN'T STAY MAD
AT YOU. I TRIED.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.400
BUT I COULDN'T DO IT.
YOU MAKE YOUR MOVE
ON THE REDHEAD?

18:21.433 --> 18:23.733
I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY
KNEW EVERYTHING

18:23.767 --> 18:26.633
THAT WENT ON IN THIS HOSPITAL.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE AN UPDATE.

18:26.667 --> 18:29.567
I SAW HER TALKING TO
THE ORTHO RESIDENT.
YEAH, AND?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.267
(monitor beeping erratically)

18:31.300 --> 18:33.067
SHE'S SEIZING.

18:33.067 --> 18:35.267
SHE'S SEIZING!

18:35.300 --> 18:37.333
SOMEBODY PAGE DR. MONTGOMERY!

18:37.367 --> 18:39.600
SOMEBODY PAGE
DR. MONTGOMERY NOW!

18:40.667 --> 18:42.333
IT'S THE CANDIRU.

18:42.367 --> 18:44.267
IT'S A FRESHWATER FISH
THAT LIVES IN THE AMAZON.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.333
IT'S A PARASITE.

18:45.367 --> 18:48.133
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.
I DIDN'T DRINK FROM THE AMAZON.

18:48.167 --> 18:50.067
DID YOU URINATE IN IT?
NO, I--WHAT?

18:50.100 --> 18:51.800
THE CANDIRU IS ATTRACTED
TO BLOOD AND URINE.

18:51.833 --> 18:54.167
IT'S BEEN KNOWN TO SWIM
UP THE STREAM OF URINE

18:54.200 --> 18:56.100
AND LODGE ITSELF
IN A MAN'S URETHRA.

18:56.133 --> 18:58.067
YOU MEAN A FISH SWAM UP--

18:58.067 --> 18:59.733
IT'S RARE, BUT THERE ARE
DOCUMENTED CASES.

18:59.767 --> 19:02.467
ONE MAN ACTUALLY SAW IT GO IN
AND TRIED TO GRAB IT.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.533
IT WAS TOO SLIPPERY.
YANG.

19:04.567 --> 19:06.533
IT'S IN THE LITERATURE.
SO THIS THING IS IN MY--

19:06.567 --> 19:08.533
(Richard)
IS NOW IN YOUR BLADDER.

19:08.567 --> 19:10.067
WELL, RIGHT NEXT TO IT.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.067
IT'S STUCK IN YOUR, UH,
PROSTATIC URETHRA,

19:12.067 --> 19:13.800
WHICH IS CAUSING
THE OBSTRUCTION.

19:13.833 --> 19:16.633
WE NEED TO GET IT QUICKLY
BEFORE IT CAUSES SEPSIS.

19:16.667 --> 19:20.300
SEPSIS?
YOU MEAN I COULD DIE?

19:22.467 --> 19:24.333
B.P. SHOT UP TO 202
OVER 134.

19:24.367 --> 19:26.267
THERE'S FETAL DISTRESS.
THE EPIDURAL DIDN'T HELP.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.600
IT'LL HELP DURING DELIVERY.
WHAT'S GOING ON? ALEX?

19:28.633 --> 19:30.633
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE SPIKED.
YOU HAD A SEIZURE.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.567
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN REDUCE
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE

19:32.600 --> 19:34.500
AND THE SWELLING
IN YOUR BRAIN

19:34.533 --> 19:37.300
IS IF WE DELIVER
THE BABY RIGHT NOW.
NO. SHE'S ONLY 30 WEEKS.

19:37.333 --> 19:40.200
I'M NOT IN LABOR.
WE'RE GONNA DO
A C-SECTION, AVA. DON'T WORRY.

19:40.233 --> 19:43.600
THE SURVIVAL RATE FOR PREEMIES
AT 30 WEEKS IS EXTREMELY HIGH.
ALEX, TELL HER NO.

19:43.633 --> 19:45.400
I'M NOT READY.
YOU'RE READY.

19:45.433 --> 19:47.600
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS
BY MYSELF.

19:47.633 --> 19:52.167
WELL, THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE NOT BY YOURSELF.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.100
I WAS ON A CONSULT
ON THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.267
THIS BETTER BE GOOD.
WHAT DO WE HAVE?
WELL, WE HAD A PATIENT
IN THE CLINIC--

19:56.300 --> 19:59.067
CHRONIC RUNNY NOSE,
A HALO SIGN ON THE PILLOW.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.800
THE FLUIDS ARE STILL IN THE LAB,
BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL--

20:01.833 --> 20:03.800
HE'S LEAKING SPINAL FLUID
THROUGH HIS NOSE.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.700
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
THIS ONE.

20:05.733 --> 20:08.500
OH, OKAY. LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S A BRAIN HERNIATION.

20:08.533 --> 20:10.533
HIS BRAIN IS LITERALLY SINKING
INTO HIS SKULL BASE.

20:10.567 --> 20:13.667
AND ALL ALONG,
I THOUGHT IT WAS A COLD.
(Derek) BOOK AN O.R.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.500
DR. BAILEY?
OH, NO, NO.

20:15.533 --> 20:18.100
YOU'RE STILL STUDYING.
YOU CAN WATCH FROM THE GALLERY.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.167
I'LL SCRUB IN WITH YOU.
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DOING JENNINGS.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.833
NO, UM, I'LL DO BOTH. I SENT
THIS GUY HOME THREE TIMES.

20:23.867 --> 20:25.700
I CAN'T NOT SCRUB IN.
(sighs)

20:25.733 --> 20:27.300
(moans)

20:27.333 --> 20:31.433
(Addison) OH, YOUR DAUGHTER
IS BEAUTIFUL, AVA.

20:31.467 --> 20:32.800
(Ava) SHE IS?

20:32.833 --> 20:35.067
(Alex) SHE IS.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.833
GET HER OVER TO THE WARMER
RIGHT AWAY.
I'LL WORK ON HER.

20:36.867 --> 20:39.200
HAND HER OFF TO PEDS.
I NEED AN EXTRA SET OF HANDS.

20:39.233 --> 20:42.133
WE NEED TO HANG SOME BLOOD.
(Ava) WHY?
WHY DO WE NEED BLOOD?

20:42.167 --> 20:44.067
(baby cries)
WANT ME TO GET
THE UTERINE ARTERIES?

20:44.100 --> 20:45.833
YEAH.
CLAMP.

20:45.867 --> 20:48.600
UH, ALEX, WHAT'S GOING ON?
ALEX?

20:48.633 --> 20:51.067
IF THE BLEEDING VESSELS
ARE DEEP--
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
AM I GONNA DIE?

20:51.100 --> 20:52.833
LIGATE AROUND THE HEMOSTATS.
GOT IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

20:52.867 --> 20:56.300
OH, MY GOD. I'M GONNA DIE.
OH, MY GOD. I'M GONNA DIE.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.400
CAN I?
GO AHEAD.

20:58.433 --> 21:00.567
I'M GONNA DIE AND MY BABY'S
GONNA BE ALL ALONE.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.367
OH, MY GOD. OH...
OH, MY GOD.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.533
AVA. AVA, LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

21:06.567 --> 21:08.667
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.767
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
YOUR BABY'S GONNA BE FINE.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.533
I JUST NEED YOU TO BREATHE
FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

21:13.567 --> 21:14.733
NICE SLOW, DEEP BREATHS.

21:14.767 --> 21:17.167
(baby coos)
THAT'S IT.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.100
JUST BREATHE.
THAT'S IT.

21:19.133 --> 21:20.433
KEEP BREATHING.

21:20.467 --> 21:22.500
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S IT.

21:22.533 --> 21:25.133
CELESTE.

21:25.167 --> 21:26.333
GOOD NEWS.

21:26.367 --> 21:28.067
NO CHANCES OF AN S.T.D.

21:28.067 --> 21:29.233
LARRY'S CONDITION--

21:29.267 --> 21:32.067
HE'S HAVING SURGERY,
BUT YOU ARE FINE.

21:32.067 --> 21:34.667
YOU DID HEAR THE PART
ABOUT YOU BEING FINE, RIGHT?

21:34.700 --> 21:36.600
THAT'S WHAT
I KEEP TELLING MYSELF,

21:36.633 --> 21:39.500
THAT I'M FINE WITH THINGS
THEY WAY THEY ARE,

21:39.533 --> 21:41.433
BUT... I PROBABLY
WON'T BE REALLY FINE

21:41.467 --> 21:44.633
UNTIL I DON'T CARE
IF HE'S FINE ANYMORE.

21:44.667 --> 21:46.733
(woman) CELESTE?

21:46.767 --> 21:49.567
I GOT HERE AS SOON AS...
IS HE IN SURGERY YET?

21:49.600 --> 21:52.367
UM, NO. THEY'RE TAKING HIM SOON.
THIS IS DR. O'MALLEY.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.733
DR. O'MALLEY...
HI.

21:53.767 --> 21:56.067
THIS IS
MR. JENNINGS' WIFE NANCY.
HI.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.833
IT'S A PLEASURE.
HE'S JUST IN THERE.

21:57.867 --> 22:00.167
THEY'RE PREPPING HIM
FOR SURGERY.
THANK YOU.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.567
I LEFT MY CAR IN FRONT
IN A NO PARKING ZONE.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.100
COULD YOU MOVE IT?

22:04.133 --> 22:06.367
(door opens and closes)

22:06.400 --> 22:09.267
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

22:09.300 --> 22:12.067
MOVE HER CAR.

22:12.067 --> 22:13.800
***

22:13.833 --> 22:15.767
TALK ABOUT
DIVINE RETRIBUTION.
WHAT?

22:15.800 --> 22:17.767
HE SLEEPS WITH HIS ASSISTANT
AND A CARNIVOROUS FISH

22:17.800 --> 22:19.600
LODGES ITSELF IN HIS PENIS.

22:19.633 --> 22:21.767
THAT'S INSTANT KARMA
IF I'VE EVER SEEN IT.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.500
YEAH, WELL, DEREK WASN'T
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING,

22:23.533 --> 22:25.433
AND NEITHER WERE YOU.
ADDISON SHOWED UP.

22:25.467 --> 22:27.833
I HAD MONTHS OF PAIN
AND SELF-LOATHING,

22:27.867 --> 22:29.800
A CRAZY, RANTING MOTHER
AND A NEAR DROWNING

22:29.833 --> 22:32.267
OFF THE SIDE OF A DOCK.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.167
I MEAN, IT'S NO FISH
IN MY HOO-HOO,

22:34.200 --> 22:35.833
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT
AN EASY RIDE.

22:35.867 --> 22:37.767
YEAH, WELL, I'VE CHEATED
ON MY BOYFRIENDS, AND I'M FINE.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.700
I MEAN, AM I THE ONLY ONE?

22:39.733 --> 22:41.667
WHICH CAKE IS YOUR FAVORITE,
OR HAVE YOU CHOSEN ONE YET?

22:41.700 --> 22:43.567
OKAY, CLEARLY,
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE POINT.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.833
I DON'T HAVE FAVORITE CAKES.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE INVOLVED.

22:45.867 --> 22:48.467
WE GOTTA GO.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.833
IF YOU SEE MY BOYFRIEND,

22:49.867 --> 22:52.600
TELL HIM I HAD SOME TUNA SALAD
AND A YOGURT,

22:52.633 --> 22:54.533
AND NOW I'M OFF TO THE O.R.

22:54.567 --> 22:57.233
OKAY, THIS IS, UH, THIS IS
NOT EATING FOR PLEASURE.

22:57.267 --> 22:59.567
I REALLY NEED A CHOICE,
SO MARK DOWN YOUR FAVORITE.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.500
SORRY I FROZE THERE
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

23:01.533 --> 23:03.067
THAT'S OKAY.

23:03.067 --> 23:05.333
I--I'M NOT--I'M NOT--
I'M NOT GETTING WEIRD.

23:05.367 --> 23:08.233
YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST
A WEIRD...
SHUT UP AND EAT SOME CAKE.

23:08.267 --> 23:09.600
(muffled) QUESTION.

23:09.633 --> 23:11.667
GOOD?
DISGUSTING.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.667
(laughs)

23:13.700 --> 23:15.267
(laughs)

23:15.300 --> 23:17.233
KAREV.

23:17.267 --> 23:19.167
HEY. I WAS JUST
CHECKING UP ON AVA.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.100
DO I HAVE ANOTHER
DENNY DUQUETTE SITUATION

23:21.133 --> 23:22.833
ON MY HANDS?
WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

23:22.867 --> 23:25.367
I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU
SO ATTENTIVE WITH A PATIENT.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.233
YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE--
CHECKING HER STATS,

23:27.267 --> 23:28.733
RUNNING TESTS,
DOING RESEARCH.
THAT'S MY JOB.

23:28.767 --> 23:30.633
NO, IT'S MY JOB.
I'M HER DOCTOR.

23:30.667 --> 23:33.833
YOU'RE MY INTERN.
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE TO
KNOW HER STATS AT ALL TIMES.

23:33.867 --> 23:36.567
BECAUSE I'M NOT ABOUT TO STAND
NEXT TO YOU IN YOUR O.R.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.300
AND BE ANYTHING LESS
THAN OVERPREPARED. OKAY?

23:39.333 --> 23:41.500
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA
GO TO WORK EVERY DAY

23:41.533 --> 23:44.400
WITH A SURGEON LIKE YOU AND NOT
BE AT THE TOP OF MY GAME.

23:44.433 --> 23:48.167
SO IF YOU WANT
TO YELL AT ME--

23:57.867 --> 23:59.200
I KNOW YOU HAVE TO
GIVE HIM THE CARDS

23:59.233 --> 24:01.067
'CAUSE YOU'RE MARRIED TO HIM.
I RESPECT THAT.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.400
BUT THERE IS AN ARGUMENT
TO BE MADE FOR FEMALE SURGEONS

24:03.433 --> 24:06.167
STICKING TOGETHER.
(sighs) YOU'RE RELENTLESS.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.133
"SISTERHOOD" AND ALL THAT,
YOU KNOW?
UH-HUH. SCARY,
INHUMAN RELENTLESS.

24:08.167 --> 24:11.067
YOU ARE LIKE A ROLE MODEL
TO ME OR... SOMETHING.

24:11.067 --> 24:12.800
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? STOP.
(laughs) OKAY?

24:12.833 --> 24:16.233
THIS IS JUST GETTING SAD.
I WILL GIVE THE CARDS TO GEORGE.

24:16.267 --> 24:19.133
I AM SURE HE WILL SHARE.
NO, HE WON'T, WITH ME ANYWAY.

24:19.167 --> 24:21.300
HE'LL JUST SHARE THEM
WITH IZZIE.

24:21.333 --> 24:23.233
THEY'RE LIKE AN EXCLUSIVE
LITTLE UNIT. WHATEVER.

24:23.267 --> 24:24.500
YANG.

24:26.233 --> 24:28.233
UH... MY, UH...

24:28.267 --> 24:30.167
MY LOCKER
IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE,

24:30.200 --> 24:32.067
THIRD ONE FROM THE DOOR.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.833
THE CARDS
ARE ON THE TOP SHELF.

24:33.867 --> 24:36.733
REALLY? YOU...
(sighs) THEY'RE ALL YOURS.

24:46.867 --> 24:48.367
OH, GOD. UM...

24:48.400 --> 24:50.633
SORRY.
IT'S OKAY. ME, TOO.

24:50.667 --> 24:52.167
I WAS, UH--
YEAH, I--

24:52.200 --> 24:54.100
SO I'M GONNA--
SO WE'RE GOOD?
YES, GOOD.

24:54.133 --> 24:55.633
GOOD. OKAY, THEN.

24:58.867 --> 25:00.567
(bell dings)

25:07.067 --> 25:09.467
DON'T TALK.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.400
UM, I KNOW IT'S NOT FAIR,

25:11.433 --> 25:13.333
AND I KNOW
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,

25:13.367 --> 25:15.500
AND I KNOW THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON BETWEEN YOU AND GEORGE.

25:15.533 --> 25:17.833
I KNOW THAT.
EXCEPT THERE IS.

25:17.867 --> 25:19.633
YOU'RE HIS BEST FRIEND.

25:19.667 --> 25:22.300
HE LOVES YOU.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.433
HE GETS YOU.
HE NEEDS YOU.

25:24.467 --> 25:26.367
AND I'M JUST--
I'M JUST--I'M HIS WIFE.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.567
AND I KNOW, I KNOW,
I GET THE SEX

25:28.600 --> 25:31.067
AND THE COMMITMENT
AND THE LIFE WITH HIM...

25:31.100 --> 25:35.267
BUT I-I WANT HIM TO GET ME
AND TO NEED ME.

25:35.300 --> 25:38.600
AND I CAN'T COMPETE
WITH YOU.

25:38.633 --> 25:40.467
SO I'M ASKING YOU...

25:40.500 --> 25:42.833
TO PLEASE STOP.

25:42.867 --> 25:46.400
JUST STOP.
FIND ANOTHER FRIEND.

25:46.433 --> 25:49.300
OR WHATEVER YOU DO,
JUST GIVE ME MY HUSBAND BACK.

25:49.333 --> 25:50.667
(bell dings)

25:50.700 --> 25:54.433
***

25:58.367 --> 26:01.267
WHAT ABOUT
THE FORKED STONE GRASPER?

26:01.300 --> 26:03.233
IT CAN LEAD
TO URETHRAL INJURY.

26:03.267 --> 26:05.067
(Richard) WELL,
THE FORCEPS AREN'T WORKING.

26:05.067 --> 26:07.333
AT THIS POINT,
I'M WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING.

26:07.367 --> 26:08.633
ALL RIGHT. STONE GRASPER.

26:08.667 --> 26:09.833
(Richard) COMING IN.

26:09.867 --> 26:11.767
(softly) DID WE MISS
ANYTHING GOOD?

26:11.800 --> 26:15.167
***

26:18.533 --> 26:21.667
HELLO? YOU OKAY?

26:21.700 --> 26:23.267
I'VE HAD BETTER DAYS.

26:23.300 --> 26:26.100
WHERE'S DR. BAILEY?

26:26.133 --> 26:27.433
PAGE HER.

26:27.467 --> 26:29.533
(monitor beeping)

26:29.567 --> 26:32.433
(Preston) V-TACH.
DOES HE HAVE A PULSE
WITH THAT?

26:32.467 --> 26:34.600
OH, HE'S GOING DOWN.
YES.

26:34.633 --> 26:36.167
HE NEEDS 150 OF AMIODARONE.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.300
HOW MUCH LONGER
YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE?

26:38.333 --> 26:40.400
YOU WORRY ABOUT GETTING
HIS ARRHYTHMIAS DOWN.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.267
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE
OUR GAME PLAN HERE.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.267
THE SCOPE ISN'T WORKING.
EXCUSE ME, DR. FISCHER.

26:44.300 --> 26:46.267
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
OPEN HIM UP.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.133
I DON'T KNOW HOW I MISSED IT.

26:48.167 --> 26:50.067
IT PRESENTED
AS A COLD, MIRANDA.

26:50.100 --> 26:51.833
THIS SORT OF THING,
AT SOME POINT,

26:51.867 --> 26:53.733
YOU THINK IT'S GONNA
GET BETTER.

26:53.767 --> 26:55.800
YOU REALLY DON'T FIGURE
IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD RUIN

26:55.833 --> 26:58.367
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.
(pager beeps)

26:58.400 --> 27:01.267
THE CHIEF.
THE CANDIRU? GO AHEAD.
WE'RE ALMOST DONE HERE.

27:01.300 --> 27:02.233
OKAY.

27:02.267 --> 27:04.700
(woman) DOCTOR.
(Derek) THANK YOU.

27:04.733 --> 27:08.233
HEY. YOU WANT TO QUIZ ME
ON THE G.I. STUFF?

27:08.267 --> 27:10.167
NO, I'M STILL TRYING
TO GET THROUGH

27:10.200 --> 27:11.767
MY CARDIO NOTES.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.600
YOU OKAY?

27:13.633 --> 27:14.800
I'M FINE.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.733
I SHOULD HAVE SNUCK IN
TO THE CANDIRU SURGERY

27:16.767 --> 27:19.500
WITH MEREDITH AND CRISTINA.
YOU STILL CAN--

27:19.533 --> 27:22.267
GEORGE, CAN YOU MAYBE
STOP TALKING

27:22.300 --> 27:25.167
SO I COULD CONCENTRATE?

27:25.200 --> 27:27.133
(lowers voice)
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

27:27.167 --> 27:30.600
(whispers)
MY PROBLEM... IS YOU.

27:30.633 --> 27:33.133
YOU'RE MY PENIS FISH.

27:33.167 --> 27:35.067
YOUR WHAT?

27:35.100 --> 27:36.833
YOU'VE CRAWLED IN,
AND LATCHED ON,

27:36.867 --> 27:39.267
AND NOW I CAN'T MOVE

27:39.300 --> 27:41.600
OR TALK OR THINK OR EVEN PEE
WITHOUT THE NAGGING FEELING

27:41.633 --> 27:43.533
THAT SOMETHING IS EATING
THROUGH MY ORGANS.

27:43.567 --> 27:45.600
(normal voice) YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE A PENIS.

27:45.633 --> 27:48.533
HOW AM I THE FISH?
IT'S A METAPHOR, GEORGE.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.467
***

27:50.500 --> 27:52.667
WHAT HAPPENED
TO US BEING FINE?

27:52.700 --> 27:55.767
I DON'T KNOW.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.833
(normal voice)
MAYBE WE'RE NOT.

27:58.867 --> 28:01.767
***

28:04.467 --> 28:05.667
(suction tube hisses)

28:05.700 --> 28:07.567
A LITTLE MORE SUCTION
THERE, PLEASE.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.100
SUCTION.

28:10.133 --> 28:12.133
THOSE BARBS
WON'T LET GO.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.133
DR. BAILEY,
GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US.

28:18.167 --> 28:20.200
OH, THIS IS USELESS.

28:20.233 --> 28:22.133
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
CUT IT OUT, DR. FISCHER.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.667
I'LL REPAIR THE BLADDER.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.800
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.200
HOW'S HIS HEART
HOLDING UP?

28:27.233 --> 28:30.200
OCCASIONAL RUNS OF V-TACH.
HE CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE.

28:30.233 --> 28:32.133
FORCEPS.

28:32.167 --> 28:33.533
OH, MAN.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.133
OKAY. ALMOST THERE.
COME ON, YOU.

28:42.133 --> 28:44.833
ALMOST THERE.

28:44.867 --> 28:47.067
GOT IT.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.600
(man groans)

28:52.633 --> 28:53.600
(gasps)

28:53.633 --> 28:55.500
OH, MAN. UNBELIEVABLE.

28:55.533 --> 28:58.233
OHH.

29:00.833 --> 29:04.533
YOU SEE THAT THING?

29:06.233 --> 29:10.067
(sighs) REMIND ME NEVER TO
PEE IN THE AMAZON.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.467
WHAT?

29:12.500 --> 29:13.600
WHAT DO YOU SAY

29:13.633 --> 29:16.567
WE HAVE A REAL MEETING
OF THE DIRTY MISTRESSES CLUB?

29:16.600 --> 29:19.533
LIKE WHAT IT SHOULD'VE BEEN
FROM THE BEGINNING.

29:19.567 --> 29:21.700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ONCE.

29:21.733 --> 29:23.700
20 MINUTES IN THE ON CALL ROOM.
NOBODY EVER FINDS OUT.

29:23.733 --> 29:26.067
MARK.
WHAT, YOU'RE TELLING ME

29:26.100 --> 29:27.833
EVERYTHING'S GREAT
BETWEEN YOU AND DEREK?

29:27.867 --> 29:30.067
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG

29:30.067 --> 29:31.567
BETWEEN ME AND DEREK?

29:31.600 --> 29:33.767
SOMETHING'S ALWAYS WRONG
BETWEEN YOU AND DEREK.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.700
ENOUGH.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

29:35.733 --> 29:38.567
(groans) NOTHING.
I'M--I'M...

29:38.600 --> 29:41.433
ADDISON AND I WERE GONNA
TRY AND MAKE A GO OF IT.

29:41.467 --> 29:43.367
THINGS ARE NOT
GONNA WORK OUT.

29:43.400 --> 29:46.267
SO YOU MAKE A PASS AT ME?
LIKE THAT'LL HELP.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.133
SHE DOESN'T WANT ME.

29:48.167 --> 29:50.167
SOMETHING'S GOTTA HELP.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.733
REVENGE SEX
IS NOT THE ANSWER.

29:52.767 --> 29:55.500
IF YOU'RE LETTING HER GO,
LET HER GO.

29:55.533 --> 29:56.833
(sighs)

29:56.867 --> 29:59.600
BE AN ADULT.

30:03.133 --> 30:05.333
THANKS...
FOR THE BABY

30:05.367 --> 30:08.067
AND FOR ME NOT DYING
AND STUFF.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.833
(chuckles) WELL, IT'S ALWAYS
A NICE BONUS

30:09.867 --> 30:11.767
WHEN A PATIENT DOESN'T DIE.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.700
YOU AND RED
MAKE A PRETTY GOOD TEAM.

30:13.733 --> 30:15.067
DON'T TELL SLOAN.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.833
OH, SHE AND SLOAN
AREN'T HAPPENING.

30:17.867 --> 30:19.500
SHE WANTS YOU.

30:19.533 --> 30:21.433
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
I KNOW EVERYTHING, REMEMBER?

30:21.467 --> 30:23.367
I HEARD HER TALKING
TO THE ORTHO DOC

30:23.400 --> 30:25.633
ABOUT HOW SHE WANTS SOMEONE
WHO BARBECUES AND PLAYS CATCH.

30:25.667 --> 30:28.433
SHE WANTS SOMEONE
WHO'S COMMITTED.

30:28.467 --> 30:30.367
YEAH. WELL, THAT'S NOT ME.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.167
I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS,
BUT IT IS.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.067
YOU MAY TALK TOUGH,
BUT YOU'RE A DECENT GUY, ALEX.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.833
WHETHER YOU WANT
TO ADMIT IT OR NOT,

30:37.867 --> 30:39.800
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
ONE OF THE GOOD ONES.

30:42.667 --> 30:44.300
MRS. JENNINGS.

30:44.333 --> 30:47.200
YOUR HUSBAND'S OUT OF SURGERY.
EVERYTHING WENT VERY WELL.

30:47.233 --> 30:49.167
OH. OH, THANK YOU.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.533
THANK YOU.

30:50.567 --> 30:52.067
THAT'S--THAT'S WONDERFUL.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.333
OKAY. DR. WEBBER WILL BE DOWN
TO FILL YOU IN SOON.

30:55.367 --> 30:59.100
UH, DR. O'MALLEY,
UM, DO ME A FAVOR.

30:59.133 --> 31:00.733
COULD YOU GO TELL CELESTE?

31:00.767 --> 31:03.767
SHE'S A BASKET CASE,
AND I JUST DON'T HAVE IT IN ME

31:03.800 --> 31:07.733
TO TAKE CARE OF MY HUSBAND'S
GIRLFRIEND RIGHT NOW.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.500
OF COURSE I KNOW.

31:12.533 --> 31:14.333
(whispers)
THE WIFE ALWAYS KNOWS.

31:30.433 --> 31:31.633
(Celeste) DR. O'MALLEY.
YES.

31:31.667 --> 31:33.567
MR. JENNINGS', UH,
PERSONAL PHYSICIAN

31:33.600 --> 31:36.100
WOULD LIKE A COPY
OF HIS MEDICAL RECORDS.

31:36.133 --> 31:38.800
UM, HERE'S THE NUMBER.
OKAY.

31:38.833 --> 31:42.167
MR. JENNINGS, I'VE CANCELED
YOUR APPOINTMENTS FOR NEXT WEEK.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.067
THERE'S JUST A CONFERENCE CALL

31:44.067 --> 31:45.800
THAT'S PROVING A LITTLE BIT
DIFFICULT TO RESCHEDULE.

31:45.833 --> 31:48.067
BUT I'M SURE DANNY
CAN HANDLE IT.

31:48.067 --> 31:50.333
WAIT, WHAT'S--WHAT'S DANNY
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

31:50.367 --> 31:52.667
I'VE ASKED HIM
TO STEP IN TEMPORARILY,

31:52.700 --> 31:55.233
UNTIL YOU FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

31:55.267 --> 31:58.100
NOW, W-WAIT, CELESTE...

31:58.133 --> 32:00.067
UH...

32:00.067 --> 32:02.067
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

32:02.100 --> 32:05.233
WELL, I THINK
SHE JUST LEFT YOU.

32:09.367 --> 32:12.267
GOOD-BYE, LARRY.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.500
(door closes)

32:16.533 --> 32:19.500
WHAT--WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

32:19.533 --> 32:22.067
I THINK I'M DONE HERE.

32:42.067 --> 32:43.400
CAN YOU BE A VAULT?

32:43.433 --> 32:46.700
I THINK I NEED A VAULT
'CAUSE I'VE EATEN LIKE

32:46.733 --> 32:48.833
A CAKE AND A HALF,
AND IT'S JUST NOT CUTTING IT.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.533
AND YOU DON'T GOSSIP.

32:50.567 --> 32:53.067
BECAUSE NOBODY TELLS ME
ANYTHING.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.533
I WAS WITH A MARRIED MAN.
IT WAS--

32:55.567 --> 32:58.733
UNH-UNH-UNH. I DON'T MIND
THAT NOBODY TELLS ME ANYTHING.

32:58.767 --> 33:01.700
IT WAS GEORGE.

33:01.733 --> 33:04.633
I WAS WITH GEORGE.

33:14.133 --> 33:18.600
IT SHOULD BE FIRM INSIDE,
NOT SPONGY.

33:19.833 --> 33:23.667
THE FROSTING,
LIKE MERINGUE--

33:23.700 --> 33:26.333
LIGHT
AND NOT TOO SWEET.

33:26.367 --> 33:28.267
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
CHOCOLATE INSIDE,

33:28.300 --> 33:33.267
BUT, UM, WELL,
I'M LEANING AWAY FROM THAT.

33:33.300 --> 33:36.067
YOU'VE THOUGHT A LOT
ABOUT THIS CAKE.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.100
THIS CAKE...

33:40.133 --> 33:42.633
FOR THIS DAY...

33:42.667 --> 33:45.167
WITH THIS WOMAN.

33:48.300 --> 33:51.200
THE RED VELVET'S YOUR WINNER,
BY THE WAY.

33:58.333 --> 34:00.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:00.267 --> 34:02.167
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
WHERE I WAS,

34:02.200 --> 34:04.100
SO I THOUGHT I'D COME
AND TELL YOU.

34:04.133 --> 34:05.800
OH, YOU'RE MOCKING ME.

34:05.833 --> 34:09.699
I'M APOLOGIZING TO YOU.

34:09.733 --> 34:12.567
YOU'RE MAKING LIGHT
OF THINGS.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.500
I'M RUNNING MY FINGERS
THROUGH YOUR HAIR.

34:14.533 --> 34:16.199
(sighs)

34:22.699 --> 34:25.067
I'M STANDING
IN YOUR BEDROOM,

34:25.100 --> 34:27.632
UNBUTTONING MY SHIRT.

34:31.733 --> 34:35.567
AND NOW I'M TAKING OFF
MY PANTS.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.500
(fabric rustles)

34:39.699 --> 34:42.266
AND NOW...

34:42.300 --> 34:45.632
I'M GETTING IN YOUR BED NAKED.

34:50.367 --> 34:52.667
MARK...

34:52.699 --> 34:54.733
WE NEED TO, UM...

34:54.766 --> 34:57.633
WE SHOULD GO GET A DRINK,
UM, AND MAYBE TALK.

34:57.667 --> 34:59.800
DO YOU HAVE SOME TIME?

34:59.833 --> 35:02.233
(sighs) I MEAN, UH,

35:02.267 --> 35:06.100
JUST SOMETHING'S ALWAYS WRONG
WITH YOU AND ME...

35:09.100 --> 35:12.367
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE
A DRINK WITH ME.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.500
I'M NOT
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

35:14.533 --> 35:17.700
WHAT...
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:17.733 --> 35:20.167
I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.533
COULDN'T HOLD OUT.

35:23.533 --> 35:26.300
ONCE A MAN-WHORE,
ALWAYS A MAN-WHORE, RIGHT?

35:32.200 --> 35:33.833
MIRANDA, GO HOME.

35:33.867 --> 35:35.767
I'M ALMOST DONE.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.733
GO HOME. SEE YOUR FAMILY.

35:37.767 --> 35:40.633
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THERE ARE
DAYS WHERE YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL.

35:40.667 --> 35:43.267
YOU HAVE TO DELEGATE.
I DID.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.467
AND THEN YOU DO
ALL THE WORK ANYWAY.

35:45.500 --> 35:48.133
AND YOU'RE STILL DOING IT.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
BETTER THINGS TO DO TODAY

35:48.167 --> 35:50.300
THAN TO RIDE HERD
ON THAT V.I.P. CASE?
THERE WAS A FISH
IN A MAN'S PENIS.

35:50.333 --> 35:53.100
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
A FISH IN A MAN'S PENIS, CHIEF.

35:53.133 --> 35:55.067
YOU CAN SAY YOU MOVIN' ON
ALL YOU WANT,

35:55.100 --> 35:57.067
BUT ARE YOU REALLY?

35:58.700 --> 36:00.067
IF YOU DON'T SLOW DOWN,

36:00.067 --> 36:03.600
YOU MIGHT END UP WITHOUT
A FAMILY TO GO HOME TO.

36:03.633 --> 36:04.700
(sighs)

36:04.733 --> 36:06.400
GOOD NIGHT, MIRANDA.

36:06.433 --> 36:08.067
(thunder rumbles)

36:08.067 --> 36:10.367
(rain falling)

36:10.400 --> 36:12.300
NOW SEE,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.733
DO WHAT?

36:13.767 --> 36:16.633
NOT LOOK HAPPY AFTER SEX.
IT'S BAD FOR THE EGO.

36:16.667 --> 36:19.100
I'M FINE.

36:19.133 --> 36:20.633
ARE WE FINE?

36:20.667 --> 36:21.600
SURE.

36:21.633 --> 36:24.267
NOT SO CONVINCING.

36:24.300 --> 36:25.533
(sighs)

36:25.567 --> 36:27.433
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
ACCUSED YOU OF HOVERING.

36:27.467 --> 36:28.667
IT WASN'T NICE.

36:28.700 --> 36:31.533
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO BE THERE FOR ME.

36:31.567 --> 36:36.167
BUT... NOW I'M...
BEING AVAILABLE,

36:36.200 --> 36:38.300
COMMUNICATING
AND GETTING NAKED

36:38.333 --> 36:40.767
AND DOING ALL OF YOUR
FAVORITE THINGS.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.800
MM. GOOD THINGS.

36:42.833 --> 36:45.467
THEN WHY ARE YOU
STILL STARING AT THE CEILING?

36:45.500 --> 36:48.233
I-I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST--I...

36:48.267 --> 36:50.367
(thunder rumbles)

36:50.400 --> 36:52.500
THAT DAY...

36:52.533 --> 36:56.333
YOU CAME OUT OF THE WATER...

36:56.367 --> 36:58.233
I SPENT THE SCARIEST HOUR
OF MY LIFE

36:58.267 --> 37:01.133
TRYING TO BREATHE FOR YOU.

37:01.167 --> 37:03.067
I LOVE YOU
AND I WANT YOU,

37:03.100 --> 37:06.067
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO...

37:07.767 --> 37:11.600
YOU DIDN'T SWIM.

37:11.633 --> 37:15.800
YOU DIDN'T SWIM,
AND YOU KNOW HOW TO.

37:15.833 --> 37:19.333
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN...

37:19.367 --> 37:22.200
UM, I DON'T KNOW IF I WANNA...

37:22.233 --> 37:25.233
KEEP TRYING TO BREATHE
FOR YOU.

37:25.267 --> 37:28.133
***

37:28.167 --> 37:29.633
(thunder rumbles)

37:29.667 --> 37:32.667
(rain falling)

37:32.700 --> 37:34.333
(sighs)

37:34.367 --> 37:36.567
I SHOULD GO.

37:36.600 --> 37:39.500
***

37:43.200 --> 37:45.133
I'LL GO.

37:45.167 --> 37:47.167
(sighs)

37:47.200 --> 37:49.733
TOO OFTEN, THE THING
YOU WANT MOST

37:49.767 --> 37:53.733
IS THE ONE THING
YOU CAN'T HAVE.

37:53.767 --> 37:55.433
(Cristina)
WHAT ACID-BASED FINDING

37:55.467 --> 37:57.367
DO YOU CLASSICALLY GET
WITH SIGNIFICANT VOMITING?

37:57.400 --> 37:59.300
HYPOKALEMIC HYPOCHLOREMIC
METABOLIC ALKALOSIS.

37:59.333 --> 38:02.067
UNBELIEVABLE.

38:02.067 --> 38:04.267
***

38:04.300 --> 38:06.400
DID YOU PICK A CAKE?

38:06.433 --> 38:10.200
UH... I LIKE THE RED ONE.

38:10.233 --> 38:12.500
***

38:12.533 --> 38:14.433
THE RED VELVET?

38:14.467 --> 38:15.767
YEAH.

38:15.800 --> 38:19.500
(muttering)

38:19.533 --> 38:23.167
***

38:30.600 --> 38:33.233
(laughs)

38:33.267 --> 38:36.167
***

38:39.067 --> 38:40.633
(George) THAT'S THE GIRL?

38:40.667 --> 38:43.600
(Izzie) RUNNY NOSE GUY'S
BIG LOVE.

38:43.633 --> 38:46.567
***

38:46.600 --> 38:49.767
I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE DO THIS.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.700
I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE WORK TOGETHER

38:51.733 --> 38:53.233
AND BE FRIENDS

38:53.267 --> 38:55.767
AND ACT LIKE
IT'S ALL OKAY.

38:57.133 --> 38:58.833
I, UM...

38:58.867 --> 39:01.800
THERE'S A SPOT AVAILABLE
AT MERCY WEST.

39:01.833 --> 39:04.400
I CALLED THEM.

39:04.433 --> 39:06.567
YOU'RE GONNA TRANSFER
TO MERCY WEST?

39:06.600 --> 39:09.233
***

39:09.267 --> 39:11.167
I HAVE TO.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.833
IT WEARS US OUT.

39:16.867 --> 39:21.367
DESIRE CAN WRECK YOUR LIFE.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.600
HEY.

39:22.633 --> 39:23.800
HEY.

39:23.833 --> 39:25.733
I WAS GONNA GO GET A DRINK.

39:25.767 --> 39:28.333

HEAD OVER TO JOE'S?

39:28.367 --> 39:31.533
YEAH. WELL, I'M KINDA UNDER IT

39:36.100 --> 39:40.267

ONCE UPON A TIME.

39:40.300 --> 39:42.200
WE COULD, UM,

39:42.233 --> 39:43.567
GO BACK TO MY HOTEL.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.600
I COULD QUIZ YOU.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.800
LOOK, UH, THIS...

39:46.833 --> 39:49.433

39:51.433 --> 39:53.200
YOU'RE NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

39:53.233 --> 39:54.433
OKAY?

39:54.467 --> 39:55.800
WHAT?

39:55.833 --> 39:57.733
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE.
TODAY WAS AWESOME.

39:57.767 --> 39:59.667
IT'S JUST...
I'M--I'M REALLY BUSY.

39:59.700 --> 40:01.600
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.567
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR...

40:03.600 --> 40:06.167
NO, OF COURSE.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.533
UH... STUDY.

40:09.567 --> 40:12.667

RIGHT?

40:12.700 --> 40:15.567
***

40:18.400 --> 40:22.100
BUT AS TOUGH AS WANTING
SOMETHING CAN BE...

40:22.133 --> 40:25.033
***

40:27.100 --> 40:30.433
THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER
THE MOST...

40:30.467 --> 40:33.667
***

40:33.700 --> 40:36.567
ARE THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WANT.

40:36.600 --> 40:40.467
