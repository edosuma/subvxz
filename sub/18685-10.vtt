WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:02.636
(doorbell rings)

00:02.670 --> 00:05.339
(exhales sharply, sniffs)

00:05.373 --> 00:07.641
(sighs)

00:07.675 --> 00:09.410
Hey, Chippy.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.145
Your hot piece of aunt around?

00:11.179 --> 00:12.713
We've been over this, Jerry.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.548
She's not interested.

00:14.582 --> 00:17.251
Neither was my first wife,
but I wore her down, too.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.420
It's a little process
I call "erosion."

00:19.453 --> 00:20.721
Oh, what a love story.

00:20.754 --> 00:21.655
(chuckles)
Sabrina.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.091
You seen Mickey?
No.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.492
She hasn't been here
the past few nights.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.993
It's been awesome.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.428
Hey, I'll take care of this.

00:27.461 --> 00:28.996
Ooh.
Beat it, Berlin.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.030
You got no business here.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.365
And you do?

00:31.399 --> 00:34.435
New rule: if Mickey's not here,
neither are you two.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.670
Well, I just came by
to drop off flowers.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.572
Oh, well, I'll just make sure
she gets them.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.374
She enjoy my chocolates?

00:40.408 --> 00:42.276
Yeah, big time.
It's amazing how easy it is

00:42.310 --> 00:44.545
to change Jerry to Jimmy
on a card.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.280
All right, you listen to me,
you son of a bitch...

00:46.314 --> 00:47.848
You listen to me, Berlin.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.184
I've been working this girl
for ten years.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.920
I am this close
to locking her down.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.355
Yeah, well, that's too bad,
because I'm gonna be

00:54.388 --> 00:55.856
coming around,

00:55.889 --> 00:57.291
and around and around,

00:57.325 --> 00:59.193
just like a cement mixer.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.294
Oh, yeah? Well, here's
the funny thing about

01:00.328 --> 01:01.729
a cement mixer, Chip,
and I've been meaning

01:01.762 --> 01:02.930
to tell you this,
they're too slow!

01:07.768 --> 01:09.370
(grunting)

01:09.403 --> 01:10.538
Screw you, pretty boy!

01:10.571 --> 01:12.540
Pretty boy? I'm uglier than you!

01:12.573 --> 01:14.942
(yells)

01:17.411 --> 01:18.546
Hot day today, huh?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.915
Yeah. You must be bacon
in the sun.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.284
Because I'm a pig?

01:23.317 --> 01:24.285
I get it.
You get it?

01:24.318 --> 01:25.286
Yeah.
That's good.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.155
(laughs)

01:28.256 --> 01:29.390
(snarling)

01:29.423 --> 01:30.758
This is embarrassing.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.593
SABRINA:
And over Mickey, too.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.761
I don't get it.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.499
(grunting)

01:39.700 --> 01:41.435
Wow. Hey, Mick.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.670
Hey, beautiful.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.439
At ease, gentlemen.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.074
(moaning)

01:47.107 --> 01:48.976
Ooh.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.178
Where the hell have you been?

01:50.211 --> 01:51.845
I was at a job interview.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.347
(scoffs) There's no way
you're up for a job

01:53.381 --> 01:54.615
where you look like that.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.083
Don't worry about where I was.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.485
Lipstick, perfume,
clothes that don't look

01:57.518 --> 01:59.253
like you got them
out of a duffel bag.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.088
You were with a man.
What's his name?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.790
I don't know what
you guys are talking about.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.658
He must be hideous if you
won't bring him by the house.

02:04.692 --> 02:05.993
I'm just saying,
you parade Jimmy around

02:06.026 --> 02:07.027
like he's some sort of prize.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.929
This guy must be a real troll.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.464
Dante is not a troll.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.166
Dante! His name's Dante.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.701
Uh-huh.
And what's wrong with him?

02:13.734 --> 02:15.102
You're clearly embarrassed.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.470
I'm embarrassed of you guys!

02:16.504 --> 02:18.005
All right?
Fine. There.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.607
I really like this guy and
I don't want to scare him off

02:19.640 --> 02:20.841
with all my baggage.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.943
We're baggage?
Yeah.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.445
You, Jimmy,
the FBI car sitting out front.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.180
Believe it or not, it's not
the most attractive package.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.481
CHIP:
That's it.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.550
I got enough to worry about
with those two idiots,

02:29.583 --> 02:31.051
now I got to take on a third?

02:31.084 --> 02:32.220
BEN:
Guys.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.687
Carrot's been acting weird

02:33.721 --> 02:35.223
since bath time.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.490
Can you fix him?

02:36.524 --> 02:37.491
Aah.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.859
I got this.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.165
Alba!

02:48.436 --> 02:52.406
Okay. Who's ready to
be lucky Carrot #12?

02:52.440 --> 02:55.876
Twelve? As in, Ben's killed
11 other bunnies?

02:55.909 --> 02:58.011
Well... not all at once. It's...

02:58.045 --> 02:59.880
just easier to buy in bulk.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.249
Oh, my God, Alba,
you're nurturing

03:01.282 --> 03:02.516
a future serial killer.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.753
I admit, the body count
does bring great shame.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.154
(scoffs)
But it is easier

03:07.187 --> 03:09.523
than explaining death
to his fragile little mind.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.092
No! Alba, you can't protect him
forever.

03:12.125 --> 03:15.062
Okay. You're right.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.531
No more enabling Ben.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.367
You tell him.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.771
Or this is the last Carrot,
and he lives

03:23.804 --> 03:26.073
a long, healthy life.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.174
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.242
Last Carrot.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.143
Last Carrot.
Come on, little guy.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.393
Show yourself, troll.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.363
Gotcha.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.564
Hey, Dante!

03:50.598 --> 03:52.800
Yeah, you.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.268
Chip... Get out of here.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.470
Look, I got nothing
against you, personally.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.205
But I don't need
another mangled goon

03:58.238 --> 04:00.374
around my house,
stinking up the place.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.476
So how about you do
everyone a favor,

04:02.510 --> 04:05.313
hop back on your tugboat
and sail to Garbage Island.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.449
Chip, I don't know this man.
Just bumming a smoke.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.719
Thank you, sir.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.321
Now get the hell out of here.
No.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.488
Sup, Mick.
(groans)

04:14.522 --> 04:16.089
Are you ready to roll?

04:16.123 --> 04:18.626
Who the hell's this guy?

04:18.659 --> 04:19.660
(sighs)

04:19.693 --> 04:21.829
Dante, Chip. Chip, Dante.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.731
That can't be right.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.734
This guy's too big and
handsome to be Dante.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.669
(chuckles)
I'm sorry to disappoint.

04:28.702 --> 04:29.737
Who are you?

04:29.770 --> 04:30.704
(sighs)

04:35.309 --> 04:36.910
He wants to meet us? Why?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.846
I don't know. If it were up
to me, Dante wouldn't even know

04:38.879 --> 04:40.180
you two existed, but
Chip ruined that.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.182
Oh. Who's Dante?

04:42.215 --> 04:43.751
Bring me up to speed.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.619
He's Mickey's new sex troll.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.620
What?

04:46.654 --> 04:48.021
Well, not exactly a troll.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.323
I mean, obviously,
something's wrong with him

04:49.357 --> 04:50.491
if he's dating her.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.526
Whoa, wha-- uh,
dating him?

04:52.560 --> 04:55.028
Why? What's wrong with me?

04:55.062 --> 04:56.664
Well, for starters,
I'm not programmed in his phone

04:56.697 --> 04:58.198
as "Vito's Pizzeria."

04:58.231 --> 04:59.867
Really? Again?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.201
Look, when we first
started plugging,

05:01.234 --> 05:02.936
I was nailing this bird
from the airport,

05:02.970 --> 05:05.539
so I had to disguise your
aunt's phone number in my phone.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.641
Yeah, and ten years
later, I'm still pizza.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.942
All right. Take a breath.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.444
I'll change your name
in my phone.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.012
No, you're not getting it.
It's not about that.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.313
It's too late, Jimmy.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.282
I'm Dante's pizza now.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.350
Ugh.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.518
Can you guys please,
just do me this one favor?

05:17.551 --> 05:20.488
No way!
We're already at capacity.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.522
What if we get rid of Jimmy?

05:21.555 --> 05:22.723
Deal.
Sold.

05:22.756 --> 05:23.657
Pack your bags, Jimbo.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.893
Y-You're chucking me?

05:25.926 --> 05:28.128
After all I've done for you?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.263
Sorry, but the people
have spoken.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.801
Oh.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.869
Yeah.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.071
Yeah. Fine.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.007
'Cause I've got
about a million other places

05:40.040 --> 05:42.342
I'd rather be right now.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.848
Okay, great. Uh,
Dante's coming over

05:47.881 --> 05:49.149
to pick me up later tonight,

05:49.182 --> 05:53.220
so if you could just do me
a favor and not be jackasses

05:53.253 --> 05:55.856
for five minutes,
that's all.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.491
Yeah, fine.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.226
MICKEY:
Okay.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.828
This'll be fun.
Let's make it quick, though,

06:00.861 --> 06:02.530
'cause I don't want
to miss the previews.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.398
Hey, kids! Come on down!

06:04.432 --> 06:07.401
There they are!
My little monkeys!

06:07.435 --> 06:09.236
Oh, boy. Here we go.
This is Sabrina,

06:09.269 --> 06:10.738
this is Ben,

06:10.771 --> 06:12.573
and this is Chip, you already
met Chip, right? The other day.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.341
DANTE:
Sup, y'all.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.677
It's nice to finally meet
you guys. I'm Dante.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.412
Good evening.
Pleasure is ours.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.713
How do you do?

06:19.747 --> 06:21.415
Okay! Have a good night--
finish your homework.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.084
Like good little, little,
little guys.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.419
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.687
I'm not buying that.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.589
The homework thing, or the...
No, no, no. All of it.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.591
Let me guess, uh, she
told you to be nice

06:30.624 --> 06:31.759
to the new guy, right?
What?

06:31.792 --> 06:32.893
(chuckling):
Don't be silly.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.027
Oh, come on, come on.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.596
My foster mom, she used
to do the same thing

06:35.629 --> 06:37.264
every time she brought
a new boyfriend home.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.732
You were a foster kid?

06:38.766 --> 06:42.269
Yup. I was. So stop playing
games with me and be real.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.238
'Cause I know you don't
want to be here, right?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.708
It's pure hell.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.443
You bitch! You bitch,
we had a deal!
Ah!

06:49.477 --> 06:51.111
DANTE: Okay, okay.
She's being honest.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.780
That's all. I'm sure they
all got burning questions

06:52.813 --> 06:54.482
for me, so hit it.
No. No, no, no, no.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.916
Let's go to the
movie, please.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.485
How about we just stay
here and hang out?

06:57.518 --> 06:58.619
'Cause we're just
getting started, right?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.087
Yeah.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.589
DANTE:
So this guy,

07:01.622 --> 07:02.956
that my foster
mom dated,

07:02.990 --> 07:05.092
Big Steve. We tortured
his ass so bad

07:05.125 --> 07:06.660
that he nearly
lost his mind.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.295
I mean, we took the
air out of his tires,

07:08.328 --> 07:10.330
we even donated his
clothes to charity.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.933
(laughter)
Don't give them any ideas,
they're horrible.

07:12.966 --> 07:13.967
It works.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.503
Hey, wow. What about this idea?

07:15.536 --> 07:16.804
MICKEY:
What?
What?

07:16.837 --> 07:17.971
(chuckles)
What? Jimmy.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.139
What?

07:19.172 --> 07:20.240
What are you doing here?

07:20.273 --> 07:21.909
(laughs)

07:21.942 --> 07:23.076
Come on.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.645
I wanted to see
a perfect family.

07:24.678 --> 07:25.846
Mr. Perfect?

07:25.879 --> 07:27.915
I'm Mr. Not Good Enough.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.583
Jimmy, go sleep
it off somewhere,

07:29.617 --> 07:31.451
you are really making
an ass of yourself.

07:31.485 --> 07:35.088
Yeah, go home, dude.
No, I'm not going
anywhere, Chip.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.123
Dante, kick his ass.

07:37.357 --> 07:38.926
Sabrina, I'm right here.
(snickers)

07:38.959 --> 07:41.028
Jimmy...
I suppose you want me
to go too, Ben?

07:41.061 --> 07:43.296
Who are you?

07:43.330 --> 07:44.765
That one hurts.
MICKEY:
Okay.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.999
No, no, no, no, no,
I got it.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.635
It hurts.
Jimmy.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.002
Yeah.
Come here, let me talk
to you for a second.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.003
Come here, come on.
Oh.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.171
No, I'm not gonna hit you.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.305
Come on, come on.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.775
Okay, look, I get it,
I get it, okay?

07:54.808 --> 07:55.776
She's dope.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.477
I get it, man.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.679
But you can't do
it like this.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.680
You love her?

07:59.713 --> 08:01.715
I freakin' love
her so much.

08:01.749 --> 08:02.850
You love
her so much.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.051
And you're a
good guy, right?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.185
I'm a really good guy.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.186
Yeah.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.155
So, look, respect her decision.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.058
Go home, sleep it off.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.793
All right?
Come on. Let's go.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.962
*
Sleep it off.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.797
Yeah.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.132
I'm gonna sleep it off.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.868
* Sunshine

08:20.901 --> 08:23.403
* Opens up my day

08:26.439 --> 08:30.277
* A cool breeze
blows along my way *

08:33.280 --> 08:37.384
* There's no time to work,
it's time to play *

08:40.353 --> 08:44.892
* Looks like love's
the only way *

08:44.925 --> 08:50.197
* And I'm happy
just to be alive *

08:50.230 --> 08:53.901
* Happy just to be alive

08:53.934 --> 08:58.105
* Happy just
to be alive, yeah *

08:58.138 --> 09:01.108
* All right.

09:01.141 --> 09:05.946
*

09:05.979 --> 09:06.947
Hey, buddy.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.049
So, where's Carrot?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.218
Carrot's not coming.
Um...

09:11.251 --> 09:12.552
SABRINA:
Uh...

09:12.586 --> 09:13.453
Why don't you
have a seat?

09:13.486 --> 09:14.955
We got to talk.

09:15.923 --> 09:16.824
Ben...

09:18.325 --> 09:19.559
Carrot's dead.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.894
Dead how?

09:20.928 --> 09:22.395
Like a cell phone?

09:22.429 --> 09:23.731
Oh, no, no, Benito.

09:23.764 --> 09:27.701
The bunny that you knew
as Carrot is no more.

09:27.735 --> 09:31.204
He-he is up in the big
sky with Jesus now.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.406
Oh. Didn't realize we
were going this route.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.408
ALBA: See, in the
Catholic religion,

09:35.442 --> 09:36.910
we believe that
when you die,

09:36.944 --> 09:38.912
your soul separates
from your body

09:38.946 --> 09:41.882
then you are judged
by the Lord.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.752
And it is up to him to decide
if you live your eternal life

09:44.785 --> 09:47.621
in Heaven or cast down
into the fiery pits of Hell

09:47.655 --> 09:49.556
with the devils.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.659
So Carrot's in Hell?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.160
No, No.
No.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.461
SABRINA: No,
ALBA: No.

09:54.494 --> 09:55.929
I'm sure Carrot was
a very good bunny

09:55.963 --> 09:57.097
and he's in heaven.
Sí.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.766
But he wasn't a good bunny.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.433
He couldn't do any tricks

10:00.467 --> 10:02.502
and he always
pooped on the floor.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.805
He's gonna burn forever.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.842
Well...

10:08.876 --> 10:10.343
only until
he's reincarnated.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.280
When he comes back as
another living thing.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.948
So Carrot can come back
as a monkey?

10:14.982 --> 10:16.583
I've always wanted a monkey.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.319
Okay, now you see why
I do the things I do.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.154
Yep, I get it.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.456
Oh, guys, thank you so much
for having me again.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.357
(all chuckle)

10:24.391 --> 10:26.093
You got an amazing
family, Mick.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.861
Yeah, they're
all right.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.529
That's funny,
I thought we were your baggage.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.699
(laughing):
Oh, you are so stupid.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.466
She's so stupid.
DANTE:
That's crazy.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.634
You want to see real baggage?

10:34.668 --> 10:36.369
I carry mine
with me every day.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.337
See this?

10:38.505 --> 10:41.108
September 26th, 1983.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.377
Bob Forsch, he pitched a
no-hitter against the Expos.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.479
That was the last day
I saw my father.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.547
Oof.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.615
(all groan)
DANTE: Yeah.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.950
I know, I know.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.618
He went to get a hot dog
during the 7th inning stretch

10:51.651 --> 10:54.888
and he just... never came back.

10:54.922 --> 10:55.956
Oh, no.
CHIP: He walked out
on a no-hitter?

10:55.989 --> 10:56.790
That's awful.
Yeah.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.291
Yeah.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.893
Well, I don't want
to be insensitive,

10:59.927 --> 11:01.661
but, uh, compared
to these guys,

11:01.695 --> 11:04.397
that baggage is kind of like a
carry-on, you know what I mean?

11:04.431 --> 11:07.367
(laughter)
We are pretty terrible.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.002
So I guess I'm being a bitch.
You're being a little bit
of a bitch.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.370
Okay. All right.
Cheers, bitch.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.372
All right, who wants some pie?
(all exclaiming)

11:12.405 --> 11:13.306
Okay.
I do!

11:13.340 --> 11:14.674
Chip, go get us some pie, man.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.044
(snickers)
No way. Make Alba do it.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.678
What are you talking about?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.380
Alba, she busted her hump
in the kitchen all day.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.882
Yeah, it's your turn
to pitch in.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.384
(laughs)
Yeah, right.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.620
Buddy, I ain't asking.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.230
(grunting)

11:37.264 --> 11:39.332
This is my house,
you son of a bitch!

11:39.366 --> 11:40.400
I make the rules!

11:40.433 --> 11:41.701
I don't get you pie,

11:41.735 --> 11:43.370
you get me pie!

11:43.403 --> 11:44.704
Don't touch me!

11:44.738 --> 11:45.839
(yells)

11:45.873 --> 11:46.706
Chip?

11:46.740 --> 11:48.876
Chip?
Hmm?

11:48.909 --> 11:49.977
What's up?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.746
Go get the pie, dude.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.883
Pie.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.717
(Dante chuckles)
Yeah.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.619
Make mine à la mode.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.154
(both laugh)

12:03.390 --> 12:05.558
Dante must be destroyed.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.027
Yeah, that's all
well and good,

12:07.060 --> 12:08.896
but what the hell is
this jerk doing here?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.463
Yeah, where's Mickey?

12:10.497 --> 12:11.464
She's not coming.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.766
I texted you from her phone.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.234
(groans)

12:14.267 --> 12:15.903
Piece of advice, kid,

12:15.936 --> 12:17.570
don't tell a guy
there's a sure thing

12:17.604 --> 12:18.638
when there isn't.

12:18.671 --> 12:19.773
Certain medications

12:19.807 --> 12:20.908
have been set
into motion

12:20.941 --> 12:22.976
that cannot be unset.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.077
What do you got,
blues?

12:24.111 --> 12:26.246
Yeah, what do you
know about it?

12:26.279 --> 12:27.480
Well, they're expensive.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.715
I got a guy.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.117
Yeah, me too.
He's called a doctor.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.451
Focus, idiots.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.386
While you two bond over
your sexual shortcomings,

12:33.420 --> 12:35.155
Dante's sweeping
Mick off her feet.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.490
What are
you proposing?

12:37.524 --> 12:38.992
We join forces.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.427
Kid's right.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.829
He's perfect for her.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.163
We got to get
rid of him.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.597
What's the plan, Chip?

12:44.631 --> 12:46.733
Well, the guy loves kids, right?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.268
Yeah.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.938
Well, what if he loved kids
a little too much?

12:50.971 --> 12:53.373
*

13:01.014 --> 13:04.284
I got to say, Chip,
I don't know about this.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.019
Relax, we're not
showing my face.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.088
Just tossing a couple photos
on this guy's hard drive.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.857
I got to say, branding this
guy a child molester...

13:09.890 --> 13:11.458
I love it.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.792
Let's see how Dante likes his
pie in prison.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.127
(door bursts open)
FBI!

13:14.161 --> 13:15.896
Whoa!
CHIP:
Whoa, whoa!

13:17.130 --> 13:18.698
It's not what it looks like.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.300
WOMAN: And now I'd like
to say a few words.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.434
Hey, Ben,
(TV turns off)

13:21.468 --> 13:23.536
I heard you lost
your bunny recently,

13:23.570 --> 13:25.172
so I thought I'd
do you one better.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.140
A puppy?
Mm-hmm.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.109
No way!

13:29.142 --> 13:30.477
Thanks, Dante.
You got it, buddy.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.712
Aw.
(laughs)

13:36.917 --> 13:38.318
You're so good to me.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.153
Well, why wouldn't I be?

13:40.187 --> 13:43.156
I love being around you,
I love being around your family.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.992
And I love you.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.360
I...

13:47.394 --> 13:49.829
I love you, too.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.331
"I love you"?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.000
Who says that?

13:53.033 --> 13:55.168
Oh, my God, is he some kind
of frickin' psycho?

13:55.202 --> 13:57.237
Hello, Mickey, is
everything okay?

13:57.270 --> 13:59.706
No!
Dante just told me he loved me.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.074
Well...
Ew!

14:01.108 --> 14:02.175
Do you love him?

14:02.209 --> 14:03.843
(yells, then groans)

14:03.877 --> 14:05.578
I mean, I should, right?

14:05.612 --> 14:06.746
I don't know. No!

14:06.779 --> 14:07.981
Oh, God, he's great.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.082
He's a great guy.
Yes.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.583
He's got a great job.
Oh, yeah.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.584
He's a frickin' tiger
in the sack.
Oh.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.519
Treats me like princess.
Mm-hmm.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.421
The kids love him.
Oh, yeah.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.589
I mean, he just got Ben a puppy!
Wait, he did what?!

14:16.623 --> 14:18.758
What is wrong with me?
I should love him, right?

14:18.791 --> 14:20.860
What kind of dog are
we talking about?
Forget about the dog!

14:20.894 --> 14:22.095
It's not about the dog, okay?
No...

14:22.129 --> 14:23.430
What is wrong with me?

14:23.463 --> 14:24.831
Alba, I have
this perfect guy,

14:24.864 --> 14:26.699
and this perfect little
family and I'm not happy.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.036
Alba, oh, God, I am
never gonna be happy.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.170
Oh, no!
No.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.838
Okay, okay, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

14:31.871 --> 14:33.040
Don't go there.
Don't go there, no.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.242
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.277
This is the
American dream.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.013
Okay? To have everything
you ever wanted,

14:40.047 --> 14:41.514
and still be miserable.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.849
What?!
Oh, yeah.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.917
Look, I know what you need.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.052
Hold on one moment.
(groaning)

14:45.085 --> 14:48.388
Oh, no, I don't like this.
It feels bad.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.023
Look, look, look.
Calm down.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.125
What's this?
Poodle's little helpers.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.561
Well, how do you think
she got by all these years?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.466
Okay, hey, Ben,

14:59.499 --> 15:01.401
we need to talk about
your new pet, okay?

15:01.434 --> 15:03.603
New? He's not new.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.539
Carrot got reincarnated
into a puppy.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.774
This is so neat.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.776
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, it's not, Ben.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.979
Okay, gimme... okay.
Okay.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.247
Listen to me, buddy, this
is gonna be hard to hear,

15:14.281 --> 15:16.649
but it's for your
own good, okay?

15:16.683 --> 15:19.386
When someone dies,
they don't come back.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.489
There is no heaven
or hell or reincarnation.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.392
This isn't Carrot.
They're gone.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.660
And you can't see 'em
anymore.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.397
Are Mommy and
Daddy dead, too.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.466
No, no, no!
What?!
Of course not.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.002
Why would you say that?

15:35.035 --> 15:36.669
Because you always say
the same stuff

15:36.703 --> 15:38.471
about Mommy and Daddy.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.273
But this is different.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.175
Mommy and Daddy
just run away...

15:42.209 --> 15:46.179
No, but not because
they do not want to be here,

15:46.213 --> 15:48.448
but because they can't.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.084
I don't believe you.
I think they're dead.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.852
You're just trying
to cheer me up

15:52.885 --> 15:54.821
with a stupid puppy!

15:59.993 --> 16:01.294
JIMMY: What do you want?
You want me to wear a wire?

16:01.328 --> 16:03.163
I'll wear a wire.
FBI AGENT: Relax.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.532
I'm not busting you.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.434
I'm on your side.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.835
What are you
talking about?

16:08.868 --> 16:11.338
I like Mickey, too.

16:11.371 --> 16:14.007
What? You got to
be kidding me.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.275
Wha--? Another one?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.044
Does it look like
I'm kidding?

16:17.077 --> 16:19.212
She's the sun in my sky.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.214
Yes, I'm talking to you.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.815
That little stunt
in the motel--

16:22.849 --> 16:24.284
that was some sloppy
work, boys. I mean,

16:24.317 --> 16:26.386
sure, you may get him
locked up for a few days,

16:26.419 --> 16:27.854
but then what?

16:27.887 --> 16:29.322
You got a better idea?

16:29.356 --> 16:31.858
You really want to
get rid of this bastard,

16:31.891 --> 16:33.826
you got to be surgical.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.166
Everybody has a weakness.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.035
Oh...

16:44.071 --> 16:45.838
Hey, pal.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.340
Where's the puppy?

16:47.374 --> 16:48.808
I don't know.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.810
She's probably in hell
with Mommy and Daddy,

16:50.843 --> 16:52.412
getting torn apart
by demons.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.982
Buddy, don't say that.
Your parents aren't dead.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.850
SABRINA: Not anymore they're
not-- they're right here.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.253
Yes, your mommy and daddy
have been

17:00.287 --> 17:02.055
reincarnated into bunnies.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.391
Are you friggin'
serious?!

17:04.424 --> 17:06.259
Yes.
Yeah.

17:06.293 --> 17:07.260
See, Benito?

17:07.294 --> 17:09.396
Now you will never

17:09.429 --> 17:11.264
feel pain again.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.666
Ease up on
the hugging, though.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.069
Okay, guys, I know,
I'm new here, right?

17:16.103 --> 17:17.337
But do you think this is
the best way

17:17.370 --> 17:18.705
to handle this situation?

17:18.738 --> 17:21.508
You're right.
You are new here.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.277
Mick? Hey, can you
come down here for a minute?

17:24.311 --> 17:25.912
MICKEY: Coming.

17:25.945 --> 17:28.448
Hi, guys.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.782
Hi.
Hi.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.352
DANTE: You good?
Me? Oh, yeah.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.753
Yeah. What's up?

17:33.786 --> 17:36.456
Okay, well, we got a little
situation with Ben over here.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.057
Wha-what situation?

17:38.091 --> 17:40.026
We just convinced him
his parents are bunnies.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.429
SABRINA: Yeah, I mean,
come on, butt out, dude.
Uh-huh.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.796
We wouldn't be in this
mess in the first place

17:43.830 --> 17:45.598
if it weren't for
your stupid dog.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.101
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
ladies, ladies, hey,

17:48.135 --> 17:49.536
Ben's gonna be okay.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.938
We're all gonna be okay,

17:51.971 --> 17:53.273
'cause I fixed
everything.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.809
Okay, Mick, what are those?

17:56.843 --> 17:58.245
Antidepressants.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.813
(long exhale)

18:00.847 --> 18:03.283
We're gonna check
on the bunny food.
Yeah.

18:03.316 --> 18:06.153
All right, so, um,
tell me something.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.920
Since when are you depressed?

18:07.954 --> 18:10.790
Since not anymore, thanks
to these little ladies.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.692
(doorbell rings)
Okay, I'm
gonna get that.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.964
Hi, is, uh, Dante here?

18:17.997 --> 18:20.233
Who are you?

18:20.267 --> 18:21.868
I'm his father.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.809
MICKEY (over radio):
Who are you?
MAN: I'm his father.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.911
How do you know this guy?
He's a C.I. who owes me.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.513
Scumbag violated his parole,

18:33.546 --> 18:34.814
so I told him,
"Do me a favor

18:34.847 --> 18:36.849
"and play the role
of Dante's father,

18:36.883 --> 18:40.153
or do 20 years."
(chuckles)

18:40.187 --> 18:42.822
Dante's gonna be
so caught up in this mess,

18:42.855 --> 18:45.258
he isn't gonna have time
for a relationship with Mickey.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.093
Uh, I'm sorry,
do I know you?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.661
It's me, Dante.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.530
Your father.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.101
Dad?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.937
I been waiting for
this moment a long time.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.807
Is that a hot dog?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.442
MAN: I got a little
something for you.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.777
The dog, Dante, take the dog.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.479
No, I-I-I know it's
kind of late,

19:06.513 --> 19:08.448
but, you know.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.251
Wow.
(laughing)

19:13.520 --> 19:15.288
(all exclaim)
Okay, we need
to step in!

19:15.322 --> 19:16.256
Go, go, go!

19:18.558 --> 19:20.793
You owe me a childhood,
you son of a bitch!

19:20.827 --> 19:22.795
MICKEY: Ooh.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.164
That's some baggage that won't
fit in your pocket.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop, you got it all wrong.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.235
That's not even
your dad.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.502
Whoa!
Oh...

19:29.536 --> 19:30.503
Oh...

19:30.537 --> 19:32.472
What?
He hammered me.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.007
Wait, what's going on?
Who are you people?

19:35.041 --> 19:36.476
We're the guys that are
supposed to be with Mick.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.511
No, I'm the guy that's
supposed to be with Mick.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.846
These guys are no good.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.013
Yeah, if you were
supposed to be

19:41.047 --> 19:42.081
with her, you'd be with her.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.083
Yeah, back off. She's mine.

19:44.116 --> 19:45.518
Who are you?

19:45.552 --> 19:48.255
Oh, come on, quit
messing around.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.556
We see each other
every day.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.691
You kidding?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.560
You really don't
know who I am?

19:55.428 --> 19:57.497
Mr. Piggy?
(giggles)

19:57.530 --> 19:59.566
Oink, oink?
(giggles)

19:59.599 --> 20:01.067
Kevin Bacon?

20:01.100 --> 20:03.736
Jon Hamm?
Ringing any bells?

20:03.770 --> 20:06.205
Are you the Fed?
Yes!

20:06.239 --> 20:08.375
These clowns all
like you, Mickey.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.243
I don't know why.
It's a whole thing.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.111
All right, you guys
need to leave.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.580
Just pipe down there, orphan.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.881
(laughs)
What'd you say to me?

20:14.914 --> 20:16.749
Yeah, that's right,
you heard him, home wrecker.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.551
All right, enough is enough.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.920
Who's it gonna be, Mick?

20:20.953 --> 20:22.789
(laughing)

20:22.822 --> 20:24.891
Come on...

20:24.924 --> 20:26.926
Oh, no.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.861
Oh, Dante,

20:28.895 --> 20:31.898
you're so big
and so good,

20:31.931 --> 20:33.366
but it's just, like,
it's too much.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.734
Ugh, you know?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.135
Ach, to you.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.970
And you, eh...

20:38.004 --> 20:39.806
too "uncle-ly."

20:39.839 --> 20:41.441
Yeah.

20:41.474 --> 20:45.077
I mean, (scoffs)
that pig stuff...

20:45.111 --> 20:46.579
Jimmy,

20:46.613 --> 20:48.748
you're just, you're too...

20:48.781 --> 20:49.816
you're too forgiving.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.452
Oh, hey, it's
not your fault.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.420
Oh...

20:55.622 --> 20:58.491
Can I ask you a question?
Did she say uncle-ly or ugly?

20:58.525 --> 20:59.592
Uncle-ly.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.428
Nice. I'm in.
You're not in.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.595
What are you talking
about, you're in?

21:02.629 --> 21:03.596
(all talking at once)

21:03.630 --> 21:04.731
(motorcycle starts)

21:04.764 --> 21:06.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:06.633 --> 21:08.901
Hey, Mick, we're confused.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.270
Who do you choose?

21:11.304 --> 21:13.239
I don't know what I want.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.907
(chuckles)

21:14.941 --> 21:16.943
But I think I'm gonna
find it out there.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.946
Hang back with the kids
for me, okay, Jimmy?

21:19.979 --> 21:22.315
You got it, Mick.

21:22.349 --> 21:25.452
(engine revs)

21:25.485 --> 21:26.786
Whoa!
Oh, ew.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.258
What a woman.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.894
Oh, that's my girl.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.964
OLD MAN:
He hammered me.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.832
