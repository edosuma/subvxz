04:56.667 --> 04:57.999
Can you pick me up, Steiner?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.458
Steiner, can you hear me?

05:02.459 --> 05:03.666
Steiner.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.666
- Good kill!
- Beautiful.

08:09.959 --> 08:11.708
Look, my new weapon.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.583
- Get one for yourself. 
- Some ammunition.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.624
- Give him a hand.
- Of course.

08:20.084 --> 08:21.124
Look at that!

08:23.000 --> 08:26.624
- Nothing we haven't seen before.
- Steiner.

08:26.709 --> 08:30.916
Look what I found running around
in the back. A little Russian fledgling.

08:37.458 --> 08:38.832
Put it down.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.999
Quickly!

09:07.667 --> 09:08.708
We go.

09:10.500 --> 09:15.499
See if you can get Meyer. Tell him we'll
need transportation from checkpoint seven.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.666
Right, sir.

09:19.417 --> 09:20.749
Bring him with us.

09:20.834 --> 09:23.999
Push, push, push, push, push!

09:25.209 --> 09:27.708
Come on, come on! Quickly!

09:32.125 --> 09:33.708
All right, stop.

09:57.917 --> 09:59.833
This damned country!

10:01.167 --> 10:03.666
Once it was a new adventure,

10:05.084 --> 10:09.458
but I have a feeling that one of these days,
this land will swallow us up.

10:10.584 --> 10:12.458
Captain Stransky, sir.

10:13.667 --> 10:16.749
- Colonel Brandt. You're welcome.
- Thank you, sir.

10:20.667 --> 10:23.374
This is my adjutant, Captain Kiesel.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.916
Captain, how are you?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.208
Thank you for asking, Captain.
I feel terrible. I've got diarrhea.

10:29.292 --> 10:30.583
How are you?

10:30.667 --> 10:33.958
You should meet your own adjutant.
Lieutenant Triebig.

10:34.042 --> 10:35.666
He's also a new arrival.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.916
Won't you join us in a glass of wine?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.874
Oh, that's very kind of you, sir.
Take my coat, please.

10:41.334 --> 10:43.041
Yes, sir.

10:46.667 --> 10:52.666
My respects, Colonel. A 1937 Mosel
in the southernmost corner of Russia.

10:54.334 --> 10:55.666
Remarkable!

10:55.750 --> 11:00.916
A bottle of Mosel is no more out of place
in this region than we are ourselves.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.541
Your health, gentlemen.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.791
I'm not going to drink to my health.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.999
It's not worth drinking to.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.458
To the end of the war?

11:20.584 --> 11:26.749
Colonel, why does our presence here
strike you as so absurd?

11:26.834 --> 11:30.666
Captain, why did you ask to be
relieved from duty in France?

11:31.459 --> 11:33.458
I want to get the iron Cross.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.208
We could give you one of mine.

11:37.292 --> 11:40.666
No, no, I'm just joking.

11:40.750 --> 11:45.083
Actually it's exactly what my
commanding officer in France asked me.

11:45.167 --> 11:47.208
"L can't stop you," he said.

11:47.292 --> 11:50.083
"Since I'm convinced that
without you the Eastern Front"

11:50.167 --> 11:52.249
"would collapse in a matter of days."

11:52.334 --> 11:55.708
"Go ahead, you heroic horse's ass."

12:02.625 --> 12:06.333
"Heroic horse's ass." His exact words.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.374
I withdraw my toast to the end of the war.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.666
To heroic horse's asses everywhere.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.708
To the patient foolish.

12:15.792 --> 12:21.166
Colonel, I would like to make something
quite clear to Captain Kiesel.

12:21.959 --> 12:28.208
I volunteered for this campaign because
I feel that men of quality are needed here.

12:29.375 --> 12:34.874
It is time to destroy the myth
of Russian invincibility.

12:34.959 --> 12:36.833
Just how do we do that?

12:37.334 --> 12:42.999
Bolstering morale, punishing those
who are insubordinate and rebellious.

12:43.084 --> 12:45.874
Instilling a new respect for ranking officers.

12:45.959 --> 12:48.999
Low morale goes hand in hand
with defeat after defeat

12:49.084 --> 12:50.874
followed by impending defeat.

12:50.959 --> 12:53.583
Now you are new to our Russian front,

12:53.667 --> 12:58.083
so I don't blame you
for talking like a horse's ass.

13:03.334 --> 13:07.291
Of course, sir, I'm not familiar
with the Russian front yet,

13:07.375 --> 13:13.249
but I firmly don't believe that the ideals
of the German soldier even...

13:13.334 --> 13:17.249
The German soldier no longer has any ideals.

13:17.334 --> 13:20.791
He's not fighting for the culture of the West,

13:20.875 --> 13:23.791
not for one form of government that he wants,

13:23.875 --> 13:25.499
and not for the stinking party.

13:25.584 --> 13:29.499
He's fighting for his life. God bless him.

13:29.584 --> 13:35.333
Well, sir, I am a soldier, and as a soldier,
I feel it is my duty to subordinate

13:35.417 --> 13:41.499
my own ideas to the principles of my country,
right or wrong.

13:42.334 --> 13:44.458
Colonel Brandt, Lieutenant Meyer, sir.

13:48.667 --> 13:51.124
- Yes?
- Steiner's on his way back.

13:51.209 --> 13:54.333
- What sort of shape are they in?
- The usual!

13:54.417 --> 13:56.124
Very well, I see.

13:56.209 --> 13:58.583
I want a briefing as soon as they're rested.

13:58.667 --> 14:02.874
- Yes, sir.
- And, Meyer, Captain Stransky is here.

14:02.959 --> 14:05.374
See that he is informed of our situation.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.708
Yes, sir.

14:13.584 --> 14:15.999
- Steiner's back.
- Of course.

14:19.042 --> 14:20.374
Who's Steiner?

14:21.459 --> 14:24.666
To you, in some ways, he could be a problem.

14:24.750 --> 14:27.208
But he's a first-rate soldier.

14:27.292 --> 14:30.124
So, we look the other way.

14:31.375 --> 14:33.708
Anything to add to that, Kiesel?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.708
Steiner is a myth.

14:40.542 --> 14:43.916
But men like him are our last hope.

14:45.167 --> 14:49.124
And in that sense,
he's truly a very dangerous man.

14:56.834 --> 14:58.458
Well, I will see.

14:59.459 --> 15:01.833
Colonel, with your permission.

15:16.875 --> 15:21.083
Well, what do you think of our new captain?

15:21.167 --> 15:24.083
I feel he thinks he is on
some kind of special mission,

15:24.167 --> 15:28.041
that is, to achieve spiritual domination
of his battalion,

15:28.875 --> 15:35.624
thereby symbolizing the purity
of the great German Wehrmacht itself.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.124
Even when going down in defeat.

16:04.667 --> 16:08.583
If they're the last of us, Stransky and Steiner,
then God help us.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.624
Medic!

16:18.709 --> 16:20.416
Medic! Medic!

16:23.167 --> 16:26.166
Captain Stransky,
welcome to the second platoon.

16:28.292 --> 16:30.416
- Lieutenant.
- Meyer, Captain.

16:31.292 --> 16:32.958
I am to show you to your quarters,

16:33.459 --> 16:35.249
brief you on our current situation.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.874
- Where's my bunker?
- Down there, in front of the factory, sir.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.999
- The second platoon is guarding your post.
- Where are they?

16:45.084 --> 16:48.249
They're just returning
from reconnaissance, sir.

16:48.334 --> 16:50.958
- Who's in charge of it?
- Corporal Steiner, sir.

16:51.042 --> 16:52.666
Oh.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.208
What is so special
about this Corporal Steiner?

16:55.292 --> 16:59.249
Early in the Novorossiysk attack,
Corporal Steiner saved Colonel Brandt's life.

16:59.334 --> 17:00.916
And mine, too.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.874
Interesting.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.749
Corporal Steiner!

17:14.584 --> 17:18.499
I'm Captain Stransky.
I'm your new commander here.

17:19.959 --> 17:21.208
Yes, sir.

17:24.166 --> 17:25.208
Who's this?

17:25.291 --> 17:27.083
Corporal Schnurrbart, sir.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.791
And the other one?

17:28.875 --> 17:31.208
That is a Russian prisoner, sir.

17:32.500 --> 17:37.624
You know as well as I do that there are orders
that no Russian prisoners are to be taken.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.041
Get rid of him.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.583
How, sir?

17:41.875 --> 17:44.541
Well, shoot him!

17:45.209 --> 17:46.958
You shoot him, sir.

17:52.209 --> 17:55.708
I will. On the spot.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.583
And then I'll deal with you.

18:03.250 --> 18:08.333
No need. I'll see that it's taken care of, sir.

18:21.375 --> 18:25.499
I want to see you in my bunker. One hour.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.249
With your full report.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.499
- Clear?
- Of course, sir.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.124
- You already drank both the vodka.
- I'm using it for the cooking.

20:30.334 --> 20:31.583
Oh, shit.

20:42.834 --> 20:45.666
- Corporal Steiner?
- I'm Lily Marlene.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.333
Come here, son.

20:55.167 --> 20:56.416
Steiner!

20:58.167 --> 21:01.416
I want to show you
what our new army looks like.

21:09.792 --> 21:12.624
- What's your name, son?
- Private Dietz, sir.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.958
They're sending us babies now.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.166
Hello, child.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.749
Private Dietz.

21:22.167 --> 21:23.374
How long have you been soldiering?

21:23.917 --> 21:26.166
Six weeks, sir. I volunteered, sir.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.666
Don't volunteer for anything around here.

21:29.042 --> 21:32.041
Just keep your eye on KrÃ¼ger here,
and myself.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.999
Do exactly as we say or you'll be wearing
boots up your ass for a long time.

21:36.084 --> 21:37.541
- Clear?
- Yes, sir!

21:38.709 --> 21:41.458
- And don't call me sir.
- Excuse me.

21:43.917 --> 21:45.999
Go with this foul-smelling one over here.

21:46.084 --> 21:47.999
Put him in Schiller's bunk.

21:53.792 --> 22:00.166
Kern, see if you can find a jacket or a blanket,

22:00.834 --> 22:02.458
something for the boy.

22:02.542 --> 22:04.916
Get Schiller's jacket.
He must have something over there.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.124
Yes, sir! Oh, excuse me.

22:08.042 --> 22:09.999
Stand at ease.

22:10.500 --> 22:11.541
Thank you, sir.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.874
- My report.
- Thank you.

22:18.625 --> 22:23.874
I regret the incident this afternoon, Corporal.

22:23.959 --> 22:25.999
But orders are orders.

22:26.084 --> 22:31.083
We have enough trouble with the feeding
of our own troops without taking prisoners.

22:32.834 --> 22:35.333
Anyway, it's very bad for security.

22:37.334 --> 22:39.916
I've read your preliminary report,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.791
and it gives me great pleasure
to inform you that

22:43.875 --> 22:46.666
Colonel Brandt and I have
agreed to recommend you

22:46.750 --> 22:51.374
for promotion to Senior Sergeant,
effective at once.

22:58.334 --> 23:01.583
Your promotion doesn't seem to have
made much of an impression.

23:01.667 --> 23:02.708
No, it doesn't.

23:08.167 --> 23:09.499
All right.

23:10.875 --> 23:13.708
I've read your report. Anything to add to this?

23:14.667 --> 23:17.666
Russians, sir. We should be
hearing from them very soon, sir.

23:17.750 --> 23:20.166
- An offensive?
- Yes, I should think so, sir.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.749
- Starting when?
- Soon.

23:26.542 --> 23:29.416
- What about your platoon?
- Two killed, one missing.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.249
Two killed, how?

23:33.084 --> 23:37.666
Bullets. Mortar fire. Artillery.
Heavy salvos. Bad luck.

23:38.084 --> 23:42.208
Terminal syphilis. The usual things, Captain.

23:43.334 --> 23:46.791
The missing man,
did you look for him, Steiner?

23:46.875 --> 23:48.166
- No, sir.
- Why not?

23:48.750 --> 23:53.416
I felt that it would be irresponsible of me
to risk the safety of the entire platoon

23:53.500 --> 23:54.708
for the sake of one man.

23:58.709 --> 24:00.208
You felt what?

24:04.584 --> 24:10.916
A non-commissioned officer does not permit
a missing man in such a case, in any case!

24:11.000 --> 24:12.624
I'll try to do better next time, sir.

24:12.709 --> 24:15.208
- I'd like to have that in writing.
- If you wish.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.749
You know, Corporal... Sergeant,

24:24.000 --> 24:28.166
I have a feeling you somewhat
overestimate your importance.

24:29.167 --> 24:33.499
At the moment,
I am free of any such illusions, sir.

24:36.292 --> 24:40.791
Well, may I suggest to you that you do not
underestimate your present company.

24:40.875 --> 24:47.499
Everything you are and may become
is dependent upon this present company.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.249
No, I will not forget that, sir.

24:51.542 --> 24:56.083
But I may add that a man is generally
what he feels himself to be.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.749
Of course.

25:07.209 --> 25:08.833
You're dismissed.

25:12.209 --> 25:14.249
I shall be back soon, sir.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.041
Is that a salute?

25:19.500 --> 25:20.583
Yes, sir.

25:22.792 --> 25:24.999
- Triebig.
- Yes, sir.

25:25.834 --> 25:30.249
You must be careful, Steiner.
He's taken a strong dislike to you.

25:30.334 --> 25:31.833
I'll survive.

25:31.917 --> 25:34.416
You're not dealing with
just another Nazi Party type.

25:37.334 --> 25:40.833
This one is pure Prussian
military aristocracy and rich.

25:46.167 --> 25:48.458
Hey, why are you bringing in the apples?

25:48.542 --> 25:50.208
To eat, you overgrown idiot.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.458
You know the ruling classes?

25:52.542 --> 25:54.749
Come now, Lieutenant,
what's left for them to rule?

25:54.834 --> 25:56.208
Don't be naive.

25:56.292 --> 25:59.666
Stransky will survive this war
one way or another.

25:59.750 --> 26:03.166
And he'll still have his land, his wealth,

26:06.167 --> 26:07.708
and his status.

26:09.084 --> 26:13.166
But he'll be very dangerous in defeat.
Be careful with him.

26:13.250 --> 26:14.833
He doesn't live in the same world we live in.

26:14.917 --> 26:17.541
No, he's living in my world now.

26:17.625 --> 26:19.124
Yeah, sure.

26:19.209 --> 26:20.583
- Lieutenant?
- Yeah?

26:20.667 --> 26:25.666
Please, would you come inside for a minute?
There's something I'd like to show you.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.874
Kern, don't just
stand there drinking, help us!

26:53.292 --> 26:55.208
Thank you. I didn't realize that you knew.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.999
Oh, you forget we are
a reconnaissance platoon.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.791
Happy birthday, Lieutenant Meyer.

26:59.875 --> 27:03.333
- Yes!
- Happy birthday!

27:07.125 --> 27:12.333
Explain everything to the Captain's orderly,
so he doesn't make any mistakes, will you?

27:16.042 --> 27:19.666
And take care of your uniform.
He's rather strict about it.

27:19.750 --> 27:23.291
Russian vodka, German wine, chickens.

27:23.375 --> 27:26.208
Oh, Maag, I don't know
how we have stayed alive so long!

27:26.292 --> 27:29.208
He's the best scavenger
in the entire regiment.

27:29.292 --> 27:33.624
- Cheers to all of you.
- Cheers!

27:34.709 --> 27:36.333
Here's to the last Russian bullet.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.916
Yeah!

27:40.000 --> 27:41.749
Here's to survival.

27:46.667 --> 27:48.041
Yeah, yeah.

27:48.125 --> 27:52.541
Yeah, yeah!

27:53.042 --> 27:55.249
Here's to your wife, girlfriend, women!

27:55.334 --> 27:56.999
Yeah! Women!

27:57.084 --> 27:59.041
Here's to the women
of the Folies-BergÃ¨re.

28:00.334 --> 28:01.791
To the girls of the Reeperbahn!

28:17.375 --> 28:19.333
Gently, gently.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.249
Here's to Dietz's virginity.

28:31.375 --> 28:35.249
Play your cards right
and we'll introduce you to Triebig.

28:35.334 --> 28:37.624
All you have to do is just bend over.

28:37.709 --> 28:40.624
Here comes the cake.

28:41.750 --> 28:44.958
Oh, cake!
Captain Stransky should see this.

28:45.042 --> 28:46.749
- Captain who?
- Here's to the cake.

28:46.834 --> 28:50.499
Cake! Here's to the cake!

28:50.584 --> 28:52.666
Stop it! Stop it!

28:53.292 --> 28:55.666
What are we doing here?
What do you think we are doing here?

28:55.750 --> 28:57.874
Playing birthday games?
Right in the middle of all that shit!

28:57.959 --> 29:00.958
- Come on...
- You shut up when I'm talking!

29:01.042 --> 29:04.666
If you want a party, okay, drink.
Get drunk. Okay?

29:04.750 --> 29:06.416
- Take it easy.
- There's a bullet for you, too.

29:06.500 --> 29:09.416
- For all of you arseholes!
- Come on!

29:09.500 --> 29:14.124
You, arsehole. You don't touch me.
You stink like a shithole.

29:30.542 --> 29:31.791
Come on.

29:33.209 --> 29:35.166
Let's not spoil everything.

29:35.834 --> 29:37.958
This is Lieutenant Meyer's birthday.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.583
Happy birthday, Lieutenant.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.041
Have a good party.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.499
- I'll have some more vodka.
- Here, fill it up.

29:56.584 --> 29:58.916
Yeah, here's some
vodka for everybody.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.416
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.874
All right, now.
Lieutenant Meyer is to have a meeting

30:08.959 --> 30:12.166
with our illustrious new commandant,
Captain Stransky,

30:12.625 --> 30:14.749
whom you'll all meet shortly.

30:14.834 --> 30:17.166
This is not a funeral, gentlemen.
This is a birthday party.

30:17.250 --> 30:20.458
Now let's drink.
We'll have a song, what the hell.

30:45.125 --> 30:46.666
Thank you, sir.

30:48.834 --> 30:52.041
Where were you stationed
before you joined the battalion?

30:53.167 --> 30:56.208
In the South of France. Biarritz.

30:56.292 --> 31:00.333
I know it well. Sit down.

31:00.917 --> 31:04.833
Sit down. Tell me about it.
It's such a beautiful country.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.041
And being transferred
must have come hard, hmm?

31:09.709 --> 31:11.541
I applied for it as you did, sir.

31:12.167 --> 31:13.458
As I did?

31:15.584 --> 31:16.999
That's interesting.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.333
And your orderly?

31:20.084 --> 31:23.999
- We served together.
- In the South of France!

31:24.959 --> 31:27.374
Those French girls!

31:31.875 --> 31:35.333
Those French girls, Triebig!

31:35.875 --> 31:39.666
I did not have much time
to think about those French girls.

31:39.750 --> 31:44.833
Really? And you, Keppler?
Did you enjoy the French girls?

31:45.667 --> 31:47.041
On occasion.

31:54.167 --> 31:57.749
Let me ask you a question, Triebig.
Do you like soldiering?

31:58.500 --> 32:00.874
Certainly, I like it, sir.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.791
But it's strange at times.

32:04.042 --> 32:06.583
It is indeed a very different world.

32:07.334 --> 32:10.999
A world of danger, and a world of men.

32:12.167 --> 32:16.208
A world without women, hmm, Keppler?

32:16.292 --> 32:19.249
- Yes.
- A world without women.

32:22.584 --> 32:23.916
Thank you.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.916
It's an old theory of mine.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.291
Men can get along without women easily,
easily, I tell you.

32:34.375 --> 32:39.333
A man's true destiny
is not just breeding children,

32:39.667 --> 32:42.791
all this childbirth, and chocolate,

32:42.875 --> 32:46.166
but to be free, to rule and to fight.

32:46.250 --> 32:49.083
In other words, to lead a man's existence,

32:50.334 --> 32:54.124
women are no more than a nuisance.

32:55.167 --> 32:57.583
Sometimes... Sometimes necessary.

32:58.334 --> 33:00.083
I'm a soldier, sir.

33:00.917 --> 33:03.041
If I have to, I can do without women.

33:03.459 --> 33:04.458
Really?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.666
And you, Keppler?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.874
Can you do without women?

33:12.292 --> 33:14.749
I do as I am ordered, sir.

33:14.834 --> 33:17.166
I like that! I like that answer.

33:17.250 --> 33:20.333
"L do as I am ordered." I like that.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.666
What is your first name?

33:25.334 --> 33:26.499
Josef.

33:27.667 --> 33:30.624
Josef, Josef.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.624
If it will help you,
I'll put your thoughts into the right words.

33:38.625 --> 33:45.083
You prefer the society of men
to that of women at any and all situations.

33:45.584 --> 33:46.749
Right?

33:51.125 --> 33:52.874
I don't understand, Captain.

33:53.459 --> 33:55.083
Come on, Triebig.

33:55.584 --> 33:59.541
You don't have to put up a front with me.
With me of all people.

34:00.750 --> 34:03.083
What I said was right, wasn't it?

34:03.167 --> 34:06.041
You prefer the society of men
to that of women.

34:06.542 --> 34:09.748
Come on, we're all soldiers.
There's no harm in it.

34:09.833 --> 34:12.373
Say yes, for heaven's sake, man, say yes!

34:14.958 --> 34:16.208
Possibly.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.248
You said yes.

34:20.083 --> 34:21.083
You said yes!

34:22.917 --> 34:26.541
He said yes, didn't he, Keppler? He said yes!

34:27.417 --> 34:31.498
You said yes. Didn't he, Keppler?
He said yes, didn't he, Keppler?

34:32.417 --> 34:33.998
- Yes.
- Louder!

34:34.667 --> 34:37.708
Didn't he, Keppler? Louder! Say yes, loud!

34:38.250 --> 34:39.248
Yes!

34:39.333 --> 34:42.498
- Louder!
- Yes!

34:55.792 --> 34:57.791
I can assure you of this,

34:58.667 --> 35:04.874
if you get caught, you'll be hanged slowly,

35:06.042 --> 35:07.083
both of you.

35:14.959 --> 35:16.208
Together.

35:18.167 --> 35:19.958
Now get out of here.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.999
Ammunition supply's running low.

35:29.750 --> 35:32.541
Sector three needs more nine millimeter.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.624
Steiner's platoon all secure.

35:37.709 --> 35:40.124
Perimeter taking light mortar shelling.

35:40.209 --> 35:42.333
Section Z47, no casualties.

35:43.167 --> 35:45.666
By the way, we didn't get the mail.

35:46.167 --> 35:48.374
That's a big one... Thank you.

35:48.834 --> 35:50.166
Oh, I see.

35:51.042 --> 35:54.124
Take your hands off my lice.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.708
- Merde!
- Oh, not again!

36:05.125 --> 36:07.749
Belch before farting, that's the rule.

36:11.167 --> 36:13.166
Sector seven, no activity.

36:18.042 --> 36:19.666
Get him outside.

36:20.792 --> 36:23.541
Kern, get yourself outside. Come on, quick.

36:23.625 --> 36:26.624
No, no, no, the Russians
might think it's mustard gas.

36:26.709 --> 36:29.958
The Geneva Convention
forbids the use of mustard gas.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.458
God damn it, Kern!

36:34.667 --> 36:38.083
What type of exhaust pipe do you have
and when was it broken?

36:38.167 --> 36:40.999
I'm well-organized and without problems.

36:43.375 --> 36:47.499
Are you equally guilty?
KrÃ¼ger, is that your natural smell?

36:48.667 --> 36:50.999
Listen, idiots,

36:52.667 --> 36:54.666
I stay dirty for a reason.

36:55.959 --> 36:59.666
If you'd been in the field for
as long as I have been, you'd know why.

37:00.500 --> 37:01.708
Explain.

37:02.250 --> 37:04.208
I learned after Stalingrad.

37:06.084 --> 37:12.333
Natural body oils combined with dirt
can keep you waterproof.

37:17.875 --> 37:19.249
Waterproof?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.083
Sure.

37:41.459 --> 37:42.833
How goes it?

37:43.584 --> 37:44.749
Quiet.

37:50.584 --> 37:51.916
Too quiet.

37:52.667 --> 37:54.291
Yes.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.666
They'll wait till first light.

38:01.667 --> 38:04.208
Rolf, what are we doing here?

38:05.000 --> 38:10.499
We are spreading the German culture
throughout a desperate world.

38:10.584 --> 38:14.041
Didn't someone say that war
is the highest expression in life

38:14.125 --> 38:15.916
for the truly cultured people?

38:16.000 --> 38:22.249
Yes, a foolish wise man named
Friedrich von Bernhardi.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.583
- Right!
- Yeah!

38:23.667 --> 38:26.166
- And Von Clausewitz said...
- Von Clausewitz?

38:26.250 --> 38:33.124
Von Clausewitz said,
"War is a continuation of state policy."

38:33.209 --> 38:34.749
"By other means!"

38:36.709 --> 38:40.333
Yes, by other means.

38:46.042 --> 38:49.041
Do you ever think about your children, Rolf?

38:49.959 --> 38:52.041
- Always.
- Where are they?

38:53.709 --> 38:55.166
I don't know.

39:16.542 --> 39:20.583
Take off one uniform,
there's always another one underneath.

39:21.417 --> 39:22.458
Go!

39:44.750 --> 39:46.541
It's all an accident.

39:48.375 --> 39:50.958
An accident of hands.

39:51.042 --> 39:52.499
Mine, others.

39:54.667 --> 39:56.333
All without mind.

39:58.042 --> 40:00.333
One extreme to another,

40:02.250 --> 40:03.916
and neither works.

40:05.459 --> 40:06.958
Nor will ever!

40:10.500 --> 40:12.666
Here we stand in the middle,

40:14.125 --> 40:16.249
in no-man's land, you and I.

40:21.917 --> 40:22.916
Go home.

40:24.709 --> 40:25.958
Go home!

40:30.959 --> 40:32.166
Steiner!

41:51.792 --> 41:53.999
- Yes, sir?
- Is it a probe, Stransky?

41:55.667 --> 41:58.708
A probe, sir? It's an avalanche!

42:00.334 --> 42:03.041
No, sir! It's an attacking force!

42:06.292 --> 42:08.374
Sir, counter-fire is needed at once.

42:08.459 --> 42:10.541
Otherwise, we'll be destroyed.

42:13.500 --> 42:14.999
We're overrun! Move out!

42:20.834 --> 42:21.874
I need help!

42:21.959 --> 42:24.666
Be calm, Stransky. You are not alone.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.916
What do you mean I'm not alone, sir?

42:28.000 --> 42:29.583
I am alone! I am alone!

42:50.167 --> 42:53.999
Steiner is gone, Triebig is gone,
I don't know where Lieutenant Meyer is.

42:54.084 --> 42:55.624
I don't know! Is he dead?

42:55.709 --> 42:57.333
- Then go to your second platoon...
- Is he dead?

42:57.417 --> 42:59.291
Salient sector and find them!

43:04.209 --> 43:06.791
And stand by and prepare the counterattack
as quickly as possible.

43:06.875 --> 43:09.833
Yes, sir! I will be counterattacking, sir!

43:12.709 --> 43:14.374
Stay in your positions!

43:14.459 --> 43:17.999
Hello? I will be counterattacking.

43:21.250 --> 43:22.791
Get some more ammunition!

43:31.417 --> 43:32.999
- Where's my weapon?
- On the wall, sir.

43:36.417 --> 43:38.041
Get that ammunition!

44:08.125 --> 44:09.499
Keep down, you fool!

44:13.000 --> 44:14.916
You, get over there!

44:16.042 --> 44:17.083
Get back to your post!

44:17.167 --> 44:19.499
- Get that phone fixed.
- Yes, sir.

44:19.584 --> 44:21.499
Get back there, damn you!

44:25.542 --> 44:27.416
Keep your positions!

44:27.500 --> 44:29.666
Everybody, keep firing!

44:33.459 --> 44:35.249
Fall out, men! Fall out!

44:38.417 --> 44:40.499
I need air cover!

44:42.750 --> 44:44.083
Fire!

44:44.834 --> 44:46.749
We're winning. We're winning!

44:54.500 --> 44:56.666
Where's my air cover? Where are my tanks?

44:58.500 --> 44:59.708
Shit!

45:12.375 --> 45:15.083
The phone is ringing! Where's the phone?

45:32.084 --> 45:33.416
Fire!

45:56.209 --> 45:58.791
- Captain Stransky.
- Where's your counterattack?

45:58.875 --> 46:01.374
We are attacking! We are defending!

46:01.834 --> 46:03.124
We're counterattacking!

46:14.084 --> 46:16.999
I'm wounded, sir. But I continue.

46:17.084 --> 46:19.124
I know my duty, sir. Don't worry.

46:19.875 --> 46:21.624
But I need ammunition!

46:38.125 --> 46:39.333
Lieutenant Meyer!

46:48.167 --> 46:50.124
Hollerbach! We must cover Steiner!

47:41.292 --> 47:42.666
Look at me.

47:50.667 --> 47:52.458
Follow the light with your eyes.

48:02.792 --> 48:03.791
Very good.

48:07.459 --> 48:09.791
That's it. Now look at me again.

48:17.209 --> 48:18.374
Sergeant!

48:21.334 --> 48:22.333
All right.

48:31.834 --> 48:33.583
Did you sleep well?

48:35.625 --> 48:36.999
Reasonably.

48:42.250 --> 48:43.249
Smell?

48:46.709 --> 48:47.916
Nothing.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.749
Any sense of taste?

48:58.959 --> 49:00.291
Improving.

49:03.792 --> 49:05.499
Quite usual in concussion.

49:07.417 --> 49:09.833
You've been like this for a week.

49:10.667 --> 49:12.666
They should return soon.

49:13.667 --> 49:17.333
Your records indicate multiple wounds
over the last few years.

49:17.417 --> 49:19.208
Any residual effects?

49:22.292 --> 49:23.624
Headaches.

49:25.500 --> 49:27.041
Blurred vision.

49:28.334 --> 49:35.166
I can't urinate out of my left ear any longer,
but otherwise I feel rather well.

49:38.875 --> 49:41.916
The doctors recommend that you stay with us
for another three weeks

49:42.000 --> 49:44.499
until they've completed your tests.

49:45.834 --> 49:48.874
Then they recommend home leave.

49:52.167 --> 49:53.291
Home.

50:54.750 --> 50:57.791
Schnurrbart? Schnurrbart?

51:10.167 --> 51:12.749
Attention! General Von Hessel!

51:44.334 --> 51:47.916
Hello, soldier? How are you?
Tell me, how do you feel?

51:49.292 --> 51:51.041
This man has severe concussion, sir.

51:52.334 --> 51:54.458
He's been highly decorated.

52:17.792 --> 52:22.041
I want 65 % of these men
returned to active duty in three days.

52:23.667 --> 52:25.458
Food!

52:29.959 --> 52:31.083
Delicious!

52:31.167 --> 52:34.833
Take the pig, the meat and the wine
into the private dining room.

52:35.000 --> 52:40.166
Come! Eat! Eat, eat, everybody! Everybody!

52:41.750 --> 52:43.083
Vegetables are good for you.

52:43.167 --> 52:45.416
They're with the compliments
of the High Command.

53:52.167 --> 53:55.499
Everybody looks
like someone else around here.

53:57.125 --> 53:59.041
Did I have a bad spell?

53:59.875 --> 54:03.749
Yeah, you were very violent.

54:04.542 --> 54:05.583
Violent?

54:05.667 --> 54:08.541
Violence should stop. It must stop.

54:11.834 --> 54:13.958
You say the violence must stop?

54:41.209 --> 54:42.958
Oh, no, I'm on duty.

54:43.167 --> 54:44.916
- Have a drink.
- No, I couldn't.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.791
They'll throw me out.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.416
Do you dance?

54:57.167 --> 55:01.333
Hold my bottle. I'll hold your waist.

55:03.917 --> 55:05.374
And we dance.

55:07.334 --> 55:10.958
Listen, this is ridiculous.

55:14.875 --> 55:16.833
It's nice.

55:32.750 --> 55:34.083
Schnurrbart!

55:34.959 --> 55:35.958
Rolf?

55:36.167 --> 55:38.666
What the hell are you doing here? Lost?

55:38.792 --> 55:39.999
No such luck, Rolf.

55:40.667 --> 55:43.624
I got it in the leg same time
you got it in the head.

55:43.834 --> 55:44.958
Schnurrbart!

55:45.042 --> 55:46.416
My vacation's over.

55:46.834 --> 55:49.541
It's back to the bad side
of old mother Russia.

55:50.375 --> 55:52.499
They took us all from our hospital.

55:53.042 --> 55:56.666
It looks like we're picking up
some of your boys as well.

55:57.042 --> 55:59.083
You want to come along
or are you doing all right?

56:02.459 --> 56:04.291
Attention, men! Prepare to leave.

56:06.834 --> 56:10.083
Corporal! Hold this truck.

56:10.167 --> 56:11.916
What the hell are you talking about?

56:12.459 --> 56:14.416
That's an order, God damn it!

56:20.209 --> 56:21.916
- Rolf?
- What?

56:22.000 --> 56:23.916
- What is it?
- What?

56:26.209 --> 56:27.416
What's the matter?

56:30.042 --> 56:31.583
I'm going back.

56:36.209 --> 56:38.583
I thought you were going back home.

56:41.334 --> 56:42.333
I have no home.

56:43.750 --> 56:45.416
My home.

56:47.667 --> 56:48.749
Our home.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.208
Do you love the war so much?

57:37.167 --> 57:41.458
Is that...
Is that what's wrong with you, Steiner?

57:50.334 --> 57:52.458
Or are you afraid of what
you will be without it?

58:15.750 --> 58:16.749
Long live Germany.

58:32.250 --> 58:33.749
I said to hold it, right?

58:33.834 --> 58:35.499
Steiner, I didn't mean it. You're crazy!

58:35.584 --> 58:36.833
Schnurrbart.

59:16.625 --> 59:17.791
Rolf!

59:22.334 --> 59:23.958
Son of a bitch!

59:25.000 --> 59:26.833
- Schnurrbart!
- Hello, Kern!

59:30.334 --> 59:32.666
- Hello, Hartwig.
- Hello, Sergeant.

59:32.959 --> 59:34.499
- Hartwig!
- Schnurrbart, how are you?

59:34.625 --> 59:36.583
Caught with your
pants down again?

59:40.084 --> 59:41.374
Anselm.

59:44.834 --> 59:46.208
Welcome back, Sergeant.

59:48.500 --> 59:50.333
- Hollerbach!
- Rolf, hello.

59:50.459 --> 59:53.499
Good to have you back, Schnurrbart.

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:01.874
KrÃ¼ger!

01:00:10.917 --> 01:00:13.333
You're back too soon.
I don't want to talk to you.

01:00:13.417 --> 01:00:14.666
Leave me alone.

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:16.624
Get your ass out of there, you old pirate.

01:00:18.334 --> 01:00:21.333
I missed you. I missed you! Yeah.

01:00:22.334 --> 01:00:23.749
My, my, my! What is this?

01:00:23.834 --> 01:00:26.416
- That's Zoll.
- That's a Party member Zoll.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.624
With compliments of Captain Stransky.

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:30.583
S.S. Special Action Squad.

01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:31.999
You still a Party member,
Hollerbach?

01:00:32.084 --> 01:00:34.999
Well, Rolf, I'd dance with the party
if I could find one.

01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:40.499
Hey, silence. The Party's convinced
we are winning the war.

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:43.333
Yeah, sure, we're winning the war.

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:51.374
I hope you've memorized our serial numbers,

01:00:51.459 --> 01:00:55.333
our mothers' maiden names correctly.

01:00:58.292 --> 01:01:01.999
I wouldn't want the Gestapo to come and
arrest the wrong man, woman or child.

01:01:03.334 --> 01:01:07.583
I don't care what you believe,
or what you've done.

01:01:09.334 --> 01:01:12.791
Your duty is to us, the platoon and me.

01:01:13.959 --> 01:01:19.041
Fulfill those responsibilities or you will have
a bayonet up your ass.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.833
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:25.374
I am playing nursemaid
to the third squad, any volunteers?

01:01:27.334 --> 01:01:28.916
- Not me.
- No chance.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.041
- Go alone this time.
- Enjoy yourself.

01:01:32.167 --> 01:01:33.374
Thanks a lot.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.999
What have we here, a hawk and a hare, eh?
I'll take you.

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:39.541
Come on, have a drink.

01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:41.916
- That's your bottle.
- Cheers, Rolf.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.958
Give me that thing. Come on.

01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:47.666
Gentlemen.

01:01:48.084 --> 01:01:49.083
Cheers.

01:01:50.292 --> 01:01:52.374
Some papers
for you to sign, Captain.

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:54.916
I'll sign them later.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.791
Stop that! Be careful with my J.J.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:00.541
Yes, sir.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.124
Have her treated correctly.

01:02:03.917 --> 01:02:07.333
- Sergeant Steiner reporting as ordered, sir.
- Come in.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:13.749
Thank you. That will be all, gentlemen.

01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:20.166
- Welcome back, Sergeant Steiner.
- Thank you, sir.

01:02:21.042 --> 01:02:24.833
Please sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

01:02:32.042 --> 01:02:35.166
Well, now that you're back,
and I'm glad you're back.

01:02:36.209 --> 01:02:40.124
I think we should make a fresh start together.

01:02:40.834 --> 01:02:44.083
But the main point is

01:02:45.459 --> 01:02:50.083
the regiment feels or believes

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:53.999
that I deserve the iron Cross now.

01:02:54.917 --> 01:02:58.291
And they've asked me to produce
two witnesses to the fact

01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:02.458
that I led the counterattack and threw
the Russians out of their positions.

01:03:02.709 --> 01:03:07.333
I have named Lieutenant Triebig and you.

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:09.999
Especially you.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.791
Lieutenant Triebig
has already submitted his signature.

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:31.583
Am I to believe this is a private conversation?

01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:36.333
That would occur to you, wouldn't it?

01:03:36.709 --> 01:03:41.166
All right, have some wine, a '36 Mosel.

01:03:44.084 --> 01:03:45.708
I'll have some.

01:03:51.917 --> 01:03:53.874
Thank you, Sergeant.

01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:04.499
But still remember that in civilian
as well as in military life

01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:06.833
the distinction is made between people.

01:04:09.417 --> 01:04:13.666
Is that what you meant when you said,
"All you are and may become"

01:04:14.959 --> 01:04:17.958
"is dependent upon this present company?"

01:04:19.792 --> 01:04:22.666
Well, the difference

01:04:24.542 --> 01:04:27.583
is a matter of ethical

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:34.749
and intellectual superiority which is caused,

01:04:34.834 --> 01:04:39.458
whether you like it or not,
by blood and by class difference.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:44.958
If I remember correctly Kant was
the son of a saddle maker

01:04:45.042 --> 01:04:48.624
and Schubert's father
was a poor schoolmaster.

01:04:50.334 --> 01:04:55.541
Perhaps talent, sensitivity and character
are no longer privileges

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:59.416
of the so-called upper class.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.666
But Kant and Schubert were exceptions.

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:05.999
We're talking about general concepts,

01:05:07.792 --> 01:05:12.624
- not individuals.
- But I am one and so are you.

01:05:13.834 --> 01:05:17.499
Didn't your fÃ¼hrer say that
all class distinctions were to be abolished?

01:05:18.042 --> 01:05:21.958
I'm an officer of the Wehrmacht.
I've never been a Party member.

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:23.874
I'm a Prussian aristocrat

01:05:23.959 --> 01:05:26.583
and I don't want to be put
into the same category!

01:05:26.667 --> 01:05:28.166
So we agree for once.

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:30.666
Good.

01:05:33.542 --> 01:05:35.208
But he is still our fÃ¼hrer.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:39.416
Unfortunately.

01:05:39.917 --> 01:05:41.166
Oh...

01:05:44.334 --> 01:05:47.999
That is a different question, Sergeant.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.208
That's not up to us to judge.

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:52.666
Why do you want it so badly?

01:05:57.792 --> 01:06:00.458
It's just a piece of worthless metal.

01:06:02.209 --> 01:06:03.333
Look!

01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:08.583
It's not worthless to me.

01:06:09.084 --> 01:06:10.916
Why is it so important to you?

01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:13.958
Tell me, Captain, why?

01:06:18.125 --> 01:06:20.666
Sergeant, if I go back

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.999
without the iron Cross

01:06:29.834 --> 01:06:31.874
I couldn't face my family.

01:06:38.334 --> 01:06:41.833
Personally, sir, I don't feel
you deserve the iron Cross.

01:06:55.292 --> 01:06:56.749
Incoming!

01:07:16.125 --> 01:07:17.166
Where are you going?

01:07:17.417 --> 01:07:19.916
I'm going to point 124.
Corporal KrÃ¼ger's over there.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.458
Are you crazy?
No one could survive this kind of assault.

01:07:22.542 --> 01:07:24.999
Get out of my way, God damn it.
I'm going after him.

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:29.499
Steiner!

01:07:29.584 --> 01:07:31.624
You get me some stretcher-bearers, damn it.

01:07:32.459 --> 01:07:34.166
Steiner! Steiner!

01:09:08.334 --> 01:09:09.749
The others?

01:09:12.625 --> 01:09:14.166
Dead, all dead.

01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:29.791
Oh, God. Listen to me.

01:09:36.667 --> 01:09:38.707
We are going to leave now.

01:09:40.167 --> 01:09:42.999
Will you get up and follow me out of here?

01:09:44.125 --> 01:09:45.416
All right?

01:09:48.959 --> 01:09:50.332
Three hours.

01:09:53.042 --> 01:09:56.749
Three hours I've been here by myself.

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:10.249
I don't ever want to be alone again.

01:10:10.334 --> 01:10:12.166
You won't, you won't.

01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:24.458
Come on.

01:10:26.125 --> 01:10:29.166
Why the hell wasn't I told
of Steiner's return to the battalion?

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:32.958
My apologies for that, sir.
There were more important things to do.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:34.791
I want him here at once.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:37.291
About a predicament of which I am sure

01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:38.708
you don't need to be reminded.

01:10:39.167 --> 01:10:41.583
- Clear, Stransky?
- Quite clear, sir.

01:10:44.292 --> 01:10:45.624
Now we shall see.

01:10:46.084 --> 01:10:48.333
I don't like the tone of his voice.

01:10:49.084 --> 01:10:51.124
I'm fed up with the whole situation.

01:10:51.209 --> 01:10:53.124
Well, it doesn't matter anymore.

01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:57.291
I know from reliable sources
that headquarters

01:10:57.375 --> 01:11:01.624
have already written off
the Kuban bridgehead.

01:11:03.417 --> 01:11:06.499
And soon the whole Crimea
will be a cul-de-sac.

01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:10.499
Report to Brandt.

01:11:13.084 --> 01:11:17.083
If you have the choice, Triebig,
between Biarritz and Siberia,

01:11:18.584 --> 01:11:19.999
what would you choose?

01:11:23.792 --> 01:11:25.791
- Steiner.
- Colonel.

01:11:28.792 --> 01:11:30.166
Sit down please, Steiner.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:37.583
How was hospital?

01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:40.833
Oh, interesting.

01:11:42.334 --> 01:11:43.749
I recommend it.

01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:56.791
Did Captain Stransky lead the counterattack

01:11:57.167 --> 01:11:59.333
the day Lieutenant Meyer was killed?

01:12:04.209 --> 01:12:05.958
Lieutenant Meyer led the attack.

01:12:06.042 --> 01:12:08.666
Captain Stransky was nowhere in sight.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.999
You're sure of that.

01:12:13.584 --> 01:12:15.333
I saw Lieutenant Meyer die.

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:20.333
Fetch Triebig.

01:12:21.667 --> 01:12:23.624
Stay, I want you to listen.

01:12:28.584 --> 01:12:29.791
Sir?

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:35.583
You signed your Captain's report.

01:12:35.667 --> 01:12:38.458
Were you present when Captain Stransky
led the counterattack?

01:12:40.875 --> 01:12:43.874
I accompanied Captain Stransky to the field

01:12:45.292 --> 01:12:47.999
and saw him calling several men around him.

01:12:48.417 --> 01:12:51.124
Then he sent me back to the command post.

01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:54.999
Then how do you know that Captain Stransky
led the counterattack?

01:12:55.167 --> 01:12:58.083
You've signed a statement
to that effect, Triebig.

01:12:58.334 --> 01:13:02.999
I wasn't there. I learned of it from
wounded men who were returning.

01:13:03.584 --> 01:13:06.374
Can you give me the name of
one of these wounded men?

01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:10.708
They were not staff men, just company men.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.416
I knew them only by sight.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.333
Besides, the smoke, the battle.
We had been under fire, sir.

01:13:19.042 --> 01:13:23.208
I want you to know, Triebig,
that I have had your statement checked.

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:28.999
Captain Kiesel will inform you
of the results of our investigation.

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:37.083
Our investigation so far has disclosed

01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:45.208
that the men in the second company who
took part in the action declared unanimously

01:13:46.375 --> 01:13:49.874
that the action was led by Lieutenant Meyer.

01:13:53.834 --> 01:13:58.499
None of them saw Captain Stransky
or Lieutenant Triebig.

01:14:05.584 --> 01:14:09.208
To my mind there is nothing
more contemptible

01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:12.166
than stealing the laurels which
properly belong to a man

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.124
who was killed in action.

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:18.249
If Sergeant Steiner stands
by his last testimony,

01:14:18.334 --> 01:14:21.624
I should be compelled to
institute disciplinary proceedings

01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:26.166
against the Captain and you.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.249
Yes, sir.

01:14:28.959 --> 01:14:31.624
Do you stand by your statement
that Captain Stransky

01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:33.458
was not with the company?

01:14:56.459 --> 01:15:02.499
Would it be possible for me to give
my answer in three or four days, sir?

01:15:02.917 --> 01:15:05.041
Did you see Stransky or not?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.958
You may go, Triebig.
You're no longer needed.

01:15:28.167 --> 01:15:30.499
What in God's name has got into you?
This is your chance!

01:15:31.125 --> 01:15:33.374
You are the only person
that stands between Stransky

01:15:33.459 --> 01:15:34.999
and his iron Cross.

01:15:35.125 --> 01:15:37.166
And you could be called as
a primary witness against him

01:15:37.292 --> 01:15:38.541
in a court of honor.

01:15:40.125 --> 01:15:43.083
My differences with Captain Stransky
are a personal matter.

01:15:43.959 --> 01:15:44.958
Now listen to me.

01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:49.291
You know that I've always shown
a great deal of understanding for you,

01:15:49.375 --> 01:15:52.499
but I'm becoming tired of
battling with your superiors.

01:15:53.375 --> 01:15:55.166
I never ask you to.

01:15:56.625 --> 01:15:58.333
Didn't ask me to!

01:16:02.834 --> 01:16:05.958
You never asked me to?
Are you out of your mind?

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:09.166
Steiner, why are you so ungrateful?

01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:20.999
What do I have to be grateful for, Captain?

01:16:22.042 --> 01:16:23.583
Your tolerance?

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:28.624
Do you think that just because
you and Colonel Brandt

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:32.166
are more enlightened than most officers
that I hate you any less?

01:16:37.209 --> 01:16:40.041
I hate all officers,

01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:43.583
all the Stranskys, all the Triebigs,

01:16:43.667 --> 01:16:46.791
all the iron Cross scavengers
in the whole German army.

01:16:49.209 --> 01:16:51.541
Have you any idea what you're saying?

01:16:57.709 --> 01:17:02.208
Do you know how much I hate this uniform

01:17:03.667 --> 01:17:05.874
and everything it stands for?

01:17:06.959 --> 01:17:07.999
God!

01:17:11.625 --> 01:17:12.833
Get out.

01:17:15.125 --> 01:17:16.874
Please, just get out.

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:21.166
Regimental headquarters.

01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:24.458
Division headquarters, sir.

01:17:24.917 --> 01:17:27.041
General Von Kellinshofe.

01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:30.166
Colonel Brandt.

01:17:31.334 --> 01:17:32.791
Yes, General.

01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:40.958
Yes, sir. I didn't know it was as bad as that.

01:17:41.292 --> 01:17:43.333
I am very sorry to hear it.

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:49.708
Well?

01:17:49.792 --> 01:17:51.999
We're pulling back
to the bridgehead at Kuban.

01:17:54.084 --> 01:17:56.916
No rear guard. Not even Steiner's platoon.

01:17:58.042 --> 01:18:00.583
We're not retreating. We're running.

01:18:14.542 --> 01:18:17.916
Captain Stransky. Yes, Captain Kiesel.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.124
I was just about to leave.

01:18:20.292 --> 01:18:22.999
Don't leave just yet. Now listen to me.

01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:30.208
Regiment feels that it is unwise
and also suicidal

01:18:30.292 --> 01:18:34.416
to leave behind any rear guard
platoons including Steiner's.

01:18:35.667 --> 01:18:37.999
I want them to join the
evacuation immediately.

01:18:38.959 --> 01:18:40.708
You understand that?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.083
Yes, Captain.

01:18:44.084 --> 01:18:45.333
Triebig?

01:18:47.834 --> 01:18:51.541
All real guard platoons
to join the evacuation immediately.

01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:53.916
Shall I notify Steiner's platoon?

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.541
Yes.

01:19:02.834 --> 01:19:04.416
Give me Steiner.

01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:36.291
Calling Regiment.

01:19:38.959 --> 01:19:40.416
Regimental headquarters. Come in, please!

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.499
Regimental headquarters! Come in, please!

01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:47.458
Regimental headquarters. Come in, please!

01:19:57.334 --> 01:19:58.833
B Company, can you hear me?

01:19:58.917 --> 01:20:00.666
Anybody come in, please!

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:06.999
Tanks!

01:20:16.209 --> 01:20:17.458
Captain Stransky,
can you hear me?

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:18.916
KrÃ¼ger!

01:20:20.959 --> 01:20:22.499
All the lines are out.

01:20:51.334 --> 01:20:53.499
Better get 'em out!
Down the tunnel!

01:20:54.667 --> 01:20:55.708
Out!

01:20:57.042 --> 01:20:58.541
Go into the factory.

01:20:59.917 --> 01:21:01.208
Get everything?

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:04.791
Fire!

01:23:10.042 --> 01:23:12.124
Zoll, grab some mines. Bring them up. Quick!

01:23:18.917 --> 01:23:21.333
On the tracks, Zoll.
Put them on the tracks.

01:23:23.417 --> 01:23:24.833
Hurry! Move!

01:23:31.375 --> 01:23:32.749
Heads down.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.291
Into the factory. Over to the factory!
Move, damn it!

01:24:25.667 --> 01:24:27.499
Maag, they're coming in from both sides.

01:24:27.584 --> 01:24:31.208
Kern, up above!
KrÃ¼ger, get up on the gangwalk! Hurry.

01:25:09.959 --> 01:25:11.458
Quick! Down the tunnel!

01:25:41.459 --> 01:25:45.583
Anselm! The grenade! Come here!

01:25:50.334 --> 01:25:51.749
Throw it!

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.291
Shit! Jesus Christ!

01:26:41.959 --> 01:26:43.624
Steiner, let's go!

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:55.583
It's clear.

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:02.499
Dietz. Cover for us.

01:27:23.834 --> 01:27:25.208
Hurry! Move!

01:27:40.959 --> 01:27:43.249
- Captain Pucher reporting, sir.
- Yes, Captain.

01:27:43.334 --> 01:27:44.749
You have your orders?

01:27:44.834 --> 01:27:47.499
And a letter for you
to be delivered personally.

01:27:47.584 --> 01:27:48.833
Thank you.

01:27:52.875 --> 01:27:54.791
You can guess what this is, can't you?

01:27:56.792 --> 01:27:59.458
- A transfer.
- Exactly.

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:04.166
Our Stransky is to report
to Paris within a week.

01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:08.583
Captain Pucher,
my orderly will see to your billeting.

01:28:08.667 --> 01:28:12.291
But don't unpack everything.
We might be going away.

01:28:12.917 --> 01:28:13.958
Captain.

01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:19.874
Stransky.

01:28:19.959 --> 01:28:22.041
Without Steiner to contradict him,

01:28:22.125 --> 01:28:24.749
he'll get his iron Cross
and strut all around Paris.

01:28:24.834 --> 01:28:28.333
The arrogant, unbloodied bastard.

01:28:29.667 --> 01:28:32.249
Stransky in Paris and Steiner...

01:28:33.417 --> 01:28:35.458
God knows where he'll be.

01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:37.541
It seems there's...

01:28:37.625 --> 01:28:40.791
What, 22, 23 kilometers between...

01:28:42.292 --> 01:28:43.958
here and Anapa.

01:28:45.834 --> 01:28:48.374
Marshland. Wilderness.

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.583
It's the same trap behind the Russian lines.

01:28:51.667 --> 01:28:53.583
Again shit, again shit, again shit...

01:28:53.667 --> 01:28:57.249
Here take your gun.
Again shit, again shit, again shit...

01:28:57.334 --> 01:28:58.791
We'll try the road.

01:29:35.584 --> 01:29:38.124
Hey, we'll never
get over this road.

01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:41.124
What's your hurry, kid?

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.458
We'll get out of this mess
in time for the next one.

01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:05.374
Steiner! Steiner, it's clear now.

01:30:12.125 --> 01:30:15.499
Let's go. Move it, move it!

01:30:17.542 --> 01:30:19.874
Anselm, move your ass!

01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:34.666
The cattle cars
or whatever they're sending

01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:37.333
are due to arrive at 1200 hours,

01:30:37.417 --> 01:30:41.916
provided, of course, that the Russian sappers
have not blown up the track.

01:30:42.209 --> 01:30:44.166
- Any questions?
- No, sir.

01:30:46.834 --> 01:30:48.166
Dismissed.

01:30:52.667 --> 01:30:56.999
Carry on probing and aggressive actions
all along the front.

01:31:02.167 --> 01:31:03.999
They're not listening.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.791
You, too.

01:31:13.375 --> 01:31:14.458
I beg your pardon?

01:31:19.417 --> 01:31:20.874
Who needs a railroad track?

01:31:20.959 --> 01:31:27.458
When we break out of here, we'll push on
with a blitzkrieg through Stalingrad

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.416
and up to the outskirts of Moscow.

01:31:39.167 --> 01:31:42.249
What will we do when we lose the war?

01:31:46.292 --> 01:31:48.333
Prepare for the next one.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:09.708
Do you think he'll get through?

01:32:11.834 --> 01:32:13.083
Steiner?

01:32:15.209 --> 01:32:16.749
I don't see how he can.

01:32:26.334 --> 01:32:28.333
Anselm, go bring Zoll in.

01:32:34.167 --> 01:32:35.999
- What is it?
- Bridge.

01:32:36.084 --> 01:32:38.291
Just bring what you need to kill with.

01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:55.249
- It's a game.
- A game?

01:32:57.917 --> 01:33:00.541
It's a kid's game.
It's bad luck to step on sunlight.

01:33:02.875 --> 01:33:06.291
I thought perhaps if I miss the beams

01:33:06.375 --> 01:33:09.499
we would all come through this all right.

01:33:12.917 --> 01:33:13.916
Come on.

01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:29.791
Come on, come on.
Over there, get in the corner.

01:37:30.084 --> 01:37:31.541
Jesus Christ!

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.749
Get these weapons out of here!

01:37:37.834 --> 01:37:40.333
KrÃ¼ger, upstairs! Schnurrbart, perimeter.

01:37:41.542 --> 01:37:42.874
Check the other buildings.

01:37:45.584 --> 01:37:48.791
Come here. Get in that corner.
Get in that room.

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.291
Come on, pretty rabbit.

01:37:51.375 --> 01:37:54.541
Don't hide from me.

01:37:55.292 --> 01:37:57.999
Check the radio,
and get that body out of here.

01:37:58.834 --> 01:38:00.124
Anselm.

01:38:00.209 --> 01:38:03.041
- Stay there!
- Get your hands off.

01:38:06.417 --> 01:38:08.083
Anselm, stop it, damn it!

01:38:10.667 --> 01:38:13.416
- Anselm! Anselm!
- Leave me, Steiner.

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.166
Wait. Stop it!

01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:21.041
Stop your fucking silly game!
This isn't a brothel!

01:38:21.834 --> 01:38:23.583
This is a war!

01:38:25.334 --> 01:38:29.166
Rolf, look what I found.

01:38:30.834 --> 01:38:32.499
I said get that body out of here.

01:38:35.167 --> 01:38:36.916
Everything clear out here.

01:38:38.125 --> 01:38:39.583
What is this?

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:45.458
It shows their basic positions
in front of Anapa.

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:47.291
Good.

01:38:47.667 --> 01:38:48.874
Means we're halfway home.

01:38:50.542 --> 01:38:52.166
Thank the ladies

01:38:52.959 --> 01:38:55.458
and tell them to take their clothes off.

01:38:55.542 --> 01:38:59.333
And what shall we do with the bodies?
Who's gonna keep them warm?

01:38:59.417 --> 01:39:02.083
- Tell them we want their tunics and trousers.
- We are going to die anyway.

01:39:02.167 --> 01:39:03.749
- Do it! Do it!
- We are going to die anyway. Let me...

01:39:03.834 --> 01:39:05.124
Let me keep one.

01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:37.374
Major.

01:39:38.667 --> 01:39:39.833
Major!

01:39:44.167 --> 01:39:45.499
She's dead.

01:39:48.792 --> 01:39:51.499
- Dietz, Zoll, watch them.
- Yeah.

01:39:52.834 --> 01:39:54.833
The rest of you, put these uniforms on.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.583
Come on, get over there with the rest of them.

01:40:13.875 --> 01:40:15.666
Pick up your weapons.

01:40:16.167 --> 01:40:17.916
Up, up, out!

01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.208
Get that uniform and take it inside.

01:40:36.167 --> 01:40:37.499
Oh, shit.

01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:09.833
Go over there.

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:13.999
Come on, pick it up.

01:41:14.084 --> 01:41:16.833
You want to play? All right.

01:41:16.917 --> 01:41:18.458
That's a nice little girl.

01:41:19.125 --> 01:41:20.833
That's it.

01:41:21.125 --> 01:41:24.541
Come on.
I'll give you something to play with.

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:29.041
I'm gonna be busy for a while.

01:41:30.167 --> 01:41:32.499
Come on.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.708
How would you like it?

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:54.916
That's nice.

01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:59.083
Steiner!

01:43:02.125 --> 01:43:03.874
Oh, Dietz.

01:43:04.792 --> 01:43:06.666
Jesus Christ.

01:43:08.125 --> 01:43:09.166
Dietz.

01:43:10.167 --> 01:43:12.208
Oh, God. God.

01:43:14.584 --> 01:43:15.958
Don't...

01:43:17.542 --> 01:43:19.208
hurt the girl.

01:43:27.292 --> 01:43:29.416
Do you believe in God, Sergeant?

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:33.333
I believe God is a sadist

01:43:36.792 --> 01:43:39.458
but probably doesn't even know it.

01:43:46.417 --> 01:43:47.541
Zoll!

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:01.499
Stupid man!

01:44:06.167 --> 01:44:08.833
Steiner! God!

01:44:10.667 --> 01:44:13.666
Take the women outside. With me.

01:44:14.417 --> 01:44:17.416
Come on. Go!

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.791
Move out! Come on!

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.208
All of you get inside. Inside!

01:44:29.084 --> 01:44:30.583
Steiner!

01:44:34.167 --> 01:44:35.666
Now we're even.

01:44:57.250 --> 01:44:59.624
And there's one other thing
you could do for me.

01:44:59.709 --> 01:45:04.083
There's a man here
that I would like to get out quickly.

01:45:04.834 --> 01:45:07.291
I spoke to you about him before.

01:45:07.375 --> 01:45:11.708
If there is a chance that he could leave
with your headquarter staff,

01:45:11.917 --> 01:45:14.791
I will be most grateful. Thank you, sir.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.541
They're rolling up both flanks.

01:45:18.125 --> 01:45:19.333
It's chaos.

01:45:19.834 --> 01:45:22.124
That need no longer concern you.

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:26.333
You're to report at once
to General Headquarters.

01:45:26.417 --> 01:45:28.333
You're being evacuated.

01:45:31.417 --> 01:45:33.666
I can't leave the Command, sir.

01:45:33.959 --> 01:45:39.291
While I'm still in a condition to issue orders,
those orders will be obeyed.

01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:43.333
I'm prepared to disobey that order, sir.

01:45:47.917 --> 01:45:49.833
You've been around Steiner too long.

01:45:50.667 --> 01:45:52.999
Come, listen to me for a moment.

01:45:58.084 --> 01:46:03.208
For many of us Germans,
the exterminator is long overdue.

01:46:03.667 --> 01:46:07.166
But I have decided that you are worth saving.

01:46:12.209 --> 01:46:14.208
But I'm part of all this.

01:46:15.917 --> 01:46:17.666
There are better people than me.

01:46:19.667 --> 01:46:21.749
Most of them are being killed out there.

01:46:21.834 --> 01:46:25.124
There's nothing wrong with you
except that you smoke too much.

01:46:26.125 --> 01:46:28.666
You're a brave man.
Braver than you think you are.

01:46:29.792 --> 01:46:33.083
One of these days there will be
a need for brave civilians.

01:46:33.167 --> 01:46:34.916
Had you thought of that?

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.541
In the new Germany,
if such a thing is allowed to exist,

01:46:39.625 --> 01:46:41.666
there will be a need
for builders, for thinkers...

01:46:43.167 --> 01:46:44.958
For poets.

01:46:45.334 --> 01:46:48.458
I begin to see now what your job is to be.

01:46:49.542 --> 01:46:52.041
I will make this my final order to you.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.541
You will search out
and contact all of these...

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.749
better people, you call them?

01:47:04.459 --> 01:47:09.249
And together you'll take on the responsibility
that goes with survival.

01:47:13.292 --> 01:47:14.833
Now you must leave.

01:47:17.209 --> 01:47:18.666
Please leave.

01:47:23.959 --> 01:47:27.666
Braun, take Captain Kiesel to the railhead!

01:47:35.792 --> 01:47:36.833
Go.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.833
Steiner, how do we get
through the Russian trenches?

01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:59.249
It's only a matter of time.

01:48:01.167 --> 01:48:03.374
They'll be building them
for a thousand years.

01:48:04.334 --> 01:48:07.499
- If not here, somewhere else.
- Not Germany.

01:48:09.667 --> 01:48:11.333
Germany.

01:48:14.834 --> 01:48:17.583
Do you think they'll ever forgive us
for what we've done?

01:48:18.917 --> 01:48:20.374
Or forget us?

01:48:25.834 --> 01:48:30.124
We'll make it. We will make it with your help.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.749
To tell you the truth I'm...

01:48:36.292 --> 01:48:37.999
I'm beginning to enjoy it.

01:48:39.875 --> 01:48:41.499
Well, you want...

01:48:42.584 --> 01:48:45.083
to be sitting in some mud hole some place,

01:48:45.167 --> 01:48:47.583
waiting for the top of your head
to be blown off?

01:48:49.459 --> 01:48:51.083
At least here we're free.

01:48:52.792 --> 01:48:53.791
Steiner.

01:48:55.584 --> 01:48:56.583
Steiner?

01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:55.041
Sing it!

01:51:08.250 --> 01:51:10.374
Go! Go!

01:51:32.625 --> 01:51:33.874
Here, Sergeant. Here's your weapon.

01:51:33.959 --> 01:51:36.958
Then all we have to do
is hope our own artillery doesn't get us.

01:51:37.042 --> 01:51:38.458
Or the landmines.

01:51:40.917 --> 01:51:42.499
Two hundred meters to go.

01:51:42.584 --> 01:51:43.624
Anselm.

01:51:43.709 --> 01:51:45.916
- Yes?
- Try to raise somebody on that radio.

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:50.124
Tell them we're coming in at dawn.

01:51:52.125 --> 01:51:54.124
We need a password. What's...

01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:56.833
What's the password?

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.041
Reconnaissance Patrol
with several Russian prisoners

01:52:03.334 --> 01:52:04.916
and no shooting.

01:52:06.334 --> 01:52:07.999
Password, KrÃ¼ger, God damn it!

01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:12.083
"Demarcation."

01:52:14.834 --> 01:52:18.541
Why not? "Demarcation."

01:52:20.042 --> 01:52:21.874
"Demarcation." Sign it Steiner.

01:52:34.042 --> 01:52:37.666
Captain, special password "Demarcation."
Signed Steiner.

01:52:38.292 --> 01:52:40.291
Coming in with prisoners.

01:52:42.417 --> 01:52:43.874
Looks like a trap.

01:52:43.959 --> 01:52:45.583
My thoughts exactly, sir.

01:52:47.792 --> 01:52:49.791
He may have been captured.

01:52:49.875 --> 01:52:51.499
- Wolf.
- Sir?

01:52:52.167 --> 01:52:53.666
Did you recognize the voice?

01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.374
No, sir, it was in code.

01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:59.499
Good code, "Demarcation."

01:53:00.167 --> 01:53:01.499
Triebig...

01:53:02.084 --> 01:53:04.208
If in the dark,

01:53:06.625 --> 01:53:10.166
you saw half a dozen men,
some in Russian uniforms,

01:53:11.875 --> 01:53:13.499
advancing on you.

01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:17.666
Could anyone blame you if you opened fire?

01:53:20.334 --> 01:53:21.333
No.

01:53:22.292 --> 01:53:26.291
Will you check the situation for me
and, take care of it?

01:53:30.667 --> 01:53:32.999
You do like Biarritz, don't you?

01:53:35.334 --> 01:53:38.999
You do like the South of France, don't you?

01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:57.749
Come on.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.249
Oh, shit!

01:54:41.042 --> 01:54:42.166
- Kern.
- Yeah.

01:54:43.167 --> 01:54:45.166
You and I will carry the weapons.

01:54:47.042 --> 01:54:50.583
The rest of you make sure your hands
are clearly placed behind your heads.

01:54:51.334 --> 01:54:53.291
I'll go first, Sergeant.

01:54:53.667 --> 01:54:55.749
No, Goddamit, Schnurrbart.

01:54:57.167 --> 01:55:00.208
There might be some asshole
who didn't know what the message is.

01:55:00.292 --> 01:55:02.249
No, I go.

01:55:02.334 --> 01:55:03.374
Rolf!

01:55:07.167 --> 01:55:09.291
You've been responsible
for all of us.

01:55:10.042 --> 01:55:12.499
This time I'm responsible for you.

01:55:16.167 --> 01:55:17.916
Take us in.

01:55:53.542 --> 01:55:55.083
Sir, look here.

01:56:28.042 --> 01:56:29.666
Welcome, Sergeant Steiner.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.416
My passage home.

01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:37.166
Steiner!

01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:40.833
Demarcation! Steiner!

01:56:41.334 --> 01:56:43.083
Steiner, we're coming out!

01:56:45.334 --> 01:56:49.083
- Demarcation!
- Demarcation!

01:56:49.334 --> 01:56:51.333
Steiner's coming in!

01:56:54.375 --> 01:56:56.333
Demarcation!

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.749
Demarcation!

01:57:01.125 --> 01:57:02.624
Barrage!

01:57:11.917 --> 01:57:13.499
Russians right in front.

01:57:13.584 --> 01:57:15.958
Schnurrbart, move out!

01:57:16.834 --> 01:57:17.999
Stand by to fire.

01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:23.833
Go, go!

01:57:36.417 --> 01:57:37.499
Fire!

01:57:46.792 --> 01:57:47.874
Demarcation!

01:57:49.875 --> 01:57:51.666
It's Steiner!

01:57:54.625 --> 01:57:55.874
It's a trap. Fire!

01:58:00.292 --> 01:58:01.333
No!

01:58:02.792 --> 01:58:04.166
God damn it!

01:58:09.167 --> 01:58:10.624
Sir, they look like prisoners.

01:58:11.125 --> 01:58:12.416
Steiner!

01:58:17.042 --> 01:58:18.666
There are German soldiers with them.

01:58:19.334 --> 01:58:21.833
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

01:58:22.084 --> 01:58:23.124
The fucking idiots.

01:58:33.584 --> 01:58:34.999
We're German soldiers...

01:58:35.084 --> 01:58:36.208
Fire!

01:58:51.584 --> 01:58:52.958
Stop it!

01:59:01.292 --> 01:59:02.499
Stop it!

01:59:02.667 --> 01:59:05.624
No!

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.208
- Keep firing!
- Stop, God damn it!

01:59:13.625 --> 01:59:14.666
Fire!

01:59:22.167 --> 01:59:23.416
Oh, my God!

01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:26.458
It's Steiner!

01:59:40.167 --> 01:59:41.999
You, stop!

01:59:50.209 --> 01:59:52.291
Go get my men, go!

01:59:52.375 --> 01:59:54.166
- Stop it!
- Stretcher-bearers.

01:59:55.667 --> 01:59:57.874
Bloody Nazi swine!

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:01.999
Swine!

02:00:04.084 --> 02:00:06.416
It's all Stransky's orders!

02:00:08.167 --> 02:00:09.833
I had no part in it.

02:00:11.459 --> 02:00:12.708
We're sorry.

02:00:18.542 --> 02:00:19.833
He's dead.

02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:26.791
I had no part in it!

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:34.999
I'm Private Dietz, sir.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.499
You're on your own.

02:02:09.167 --> 02:02:12.624
If I don't find you,
join up with another outfit, another platoon.

02:02:14.334 --> 02:02:17.041
A deserter. I don't care.
It doesn't matter anymore.

02:02:19.125 --> 02:02:20.874
Where are you going?

02:02:21.792 --> 02:02:23.374
To pay my debts.

02:02:23.917 --> 02:02:28.874
You are our platoon leader!
This thing isn't over yet.

02:02:34.167 --> 02:02:36.416
You're the new platoon leader.

02:02:38.375 --> 02:02:40.499
And Anselm is your platoon.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.291
That should make you happy, you old pirate.

02:02:46.375 --> 02:02:48.999
Steiner! Steiner!

02:02:52.167 --> 02:02:53.791
Steiner!

02:03:53.292 --> 02:03:54.624
Yes, Colonel Brandt?

02:03:55.167 --> 02:03:58.041
Situation is worsening here. You're needed.

02:04:00.125 --> 02:04:01.791
If my orders are here...

02:04:03.834 --> 02:04:04.916
And they are here, sir,

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.333
then my replacement is already
with the Company.

02:04:07.417 --> 02:04:09.083
You may leave, Stransky.

02:05:15.834 --> 02:05:18.791
Your Triebig is dead.

02:05:22.167 --> 02:05:24.124
It didn't work, Captain.

02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:26.666
I live.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.458
You are dead.

02:05:31.125 --> 02:05:34.833
Lieutenant Triebig has not been
under my command for several hours.

02:05:35.834 --> 02:05:40.083
- He has been transferred.
- You aristocratic...

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.499
pile of Prussian pig shit!

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.749
Leaving without your iron Cross, Captain?

02:06:12.167 --> 02:06:13.958
Just a matter of time.

02:06:18.667 --> 02:06:20.749
Where's the rest of your platoon?

02:06:27.042 --> 02:06:31.333
I said, "Where's the rest of your platoon,"
Sergeant Steiner!

02:06:41.334 --> 02:06:42.666
You are...

02:06:44.375 --> 02:06:46.083
Captain Stransky.

02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:51.791
You are the rest of my platoon.

02:07:08.875 --> 02:07:11.791
- Know how to use it?
- Yes, of course.

02:07:34.792 --> 02:07:37.999
Fine, I accept.

02:07:39.834 --> 02:07:42.208
I'll show you how a Prussian officer can fight.

02:07:48.667 --> 02:07:50.291
And I'll show you

02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:53.541
where the iron Crosses grow.

02:08:33.167 --> 02:08:34.249
Now!

02:08:47.375 --> 02:08:49.666
Hey, get out! Get out of the way!

02:09:17.667 --> 02:09:18.791
Stop there!

02:09:22.125 --> 02:09:23.291
Advance with me.

02:09:55.084 --> 02:09:56.291
Get up.

02:09:57.709 --> 02:10:00.249
Stransky, God damn it! Get off your ass!

02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:02.708
I have to reload.

02:10:03.417 --> 02:10:05.833
How do I reload, Sergeant Steiner?
