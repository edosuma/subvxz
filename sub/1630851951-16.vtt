about it in school today,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.600
she seems pretty interested.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.102
- You know,
growing up in the South,

03:24.104 --> 03:29.274
all the girls in my family
had to learn to quilt,

03:29.276 --> 03:31.643
especially those who
lived on the farm.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.912
But, you know, if you were
fortunate enough

03:33.914 --> 03:35.347
to become a star,

03:35.349 --> 03:36.815
then you no longer
had to do that,

03:36.817 --> 03:39.551
you could just have
custom-made quilts [giggles].

you chose the latter.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.156

03:44.158 --> 03:45.958
we learned how at first early
Black Americans quilted

03:45.960 --> 03:47.926
out of necessity
to provide warmth.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.828
Soon they turned them
into works of art,

03:49.830 --> 03:52.130
like, Bertha Bachus, who told
stories through folklore quilts.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.799
- Ain't that the truth?

03:53.801 --> 03:56.702
We can always turn
a situation into art.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.204
You know, spirituals
arose out of slavery.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.939

04:00.941 --> 04:03.976
and--and--and--and Reagan
years brought us hip hop.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.877

gave us Black Qwikgram.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.079

04:07.081 --> 04:08.847
- You know, my mother
and her friends,

04:08.849 --> 04:11.483
they would gather
in quilting circles,

04:11.485 --> 04:14.720
they call it fellowshipping,
but actually, it was gossiping.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.188

- Okay, wait, that must

04:16.190 --> 04:17.556

04:17.558 --> 04:18.857

make one together.

but I'm gonna have to leave
the quilting to you two.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.008

04:36.010 --> 04:38.176
that these fingers aren't made
for stitching.

04:38.178 --> 04:41.346

04:41.348 --> 04:43.649

- All right, guys, Umba dance

04:53.360 --> 04:57.796

at breakfast this morning, aah.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.965
- [audience laughs]
- And--and I don't dance,

04:59.967 --> 05:02.768
it's a mindless
gratuitous behavior.

05:02.770 --> 05:06.805

no rhythm [laughs].

05:06.807 --> 05:08.106

teaching the class.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.712

coming to teach y'all today.

05:13.714 --> 05:19.117

pass by the group.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.521

cool stuff for our quilt.

an apology to Leah.
