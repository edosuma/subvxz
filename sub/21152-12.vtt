[cell phone buzzing]

00:10.433 --> 00:11.467
- Caitlin?

00:11.533 --> 00:13.100
- No, it's Josh. Hi.

00:13.167 --> 00:14.667
- Josh?

00:14.733 --> 00:16.733
Uh, what's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.700
Uh, I'm in Ireland, actually,

00:18.767 --> 00:20.333
with, uh--with Clare.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.000
- Hi, Liza!

00:22.067 --> 00:23.567
- Uh, hi, Clare.

00:23.633 --> 00:25.067
Ireland. Wow.

00:25.133 --> 00:26.667
- Yeah, I got here yesterday.

00:26.733 --> 00:29.367
I kind of missed her,
you know?

00:29.433 --> 00:30.800
Wasn't ready to let her go.

00:30.867 --> 00:32.567
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.000
But I can't stay here
forever,

00:34.067 --> 00:36.067
so I figured the only way

00:36.133 --> 00:39.533
we could keep dating...
is if I marry her.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.200
- What?
You're gonna marry Clare?

00:41.267 --> 00:42.767
- Yeah.
It's the only way to know

00:42.833 --> 00:44.133
what we've got, you know?

00:44.200 --> 00:45.800
Plus, she'll get a green card

00:45.867 --> 00:47.267
so she can keep working
back in New York--

00:47.333 --> 00:49.433
- Josh, are you sure?

00:49.500 --> 00:52.067
[stammering] A green card
marriage is still a marriage.

00:52.133 --> 00:53.800
- I know what I'm doing,
all right?

00:53.867 --> 00:55.667
You're responsible
for all of this,

00:55.733 --> 00:58.000
so it would mean a lot to me--

00:58.067 --> 01:00.933
to both of us, really--

01:01.067 --> 01:02.733
if you were here.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.467
- Here? You mean there?
In Ireland?

01:05.533 --> 01:08.600
- I kind of need you, Liza.

[soft dramatic music]

01:12.733 --> 01:14.200

Maggie, wake up.

01:14.267 --> 01:16.400
- What?
What, is--is there a fire?

01:16.467 --> 01:17.933
- Sort of.
Pack your bags.

01:18.067 --> 01:19.333
We're going to Ireland.

01:25.833 --> 01:28.467

01:28.533 --> 01:30.200
- This weekend. Green card.

01:30.267 --> 01:31.933
- I mean, at least we know
she's not pregnant.

01:32.067 --> 01:33.733
They've only been dating,
like, three weeks.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.067
- That's you, always looking
on the bright side.

01:35.067 --> 01:37.433
- Morning, Liza.
Peters.

01:37.500 --> 01:41.600
- Ugh, I wish I could see
the bright side in that.

01:41.667 --> 01:42.867
- I'll be back on Monday.

01:42.933 --> 01:44.633
So sorry for the late notice.

01:44.700 --> 01:47.200
But everything is in order
on "Marriage Vacation."

01:47.267 --> 01:49.067
- So you're taking one.
Interesting.

01:49.133 --> 01:50.133
- Not exactly.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.200
Uh, Josh asked me to--

01:52.267 --> 01:53.800
- Oh, my God,
the boy chasing.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.200
Will you never learn?

01:55.267 --> 01:56.867
Take it from
a newly single woman.

01:56.933 --> 01:58.967
Men are nothing
but a distract--

01:59.067 --> 02:00.800
- Morning, Diana.
I just want to say

02:00.867 --> 02:02.667
how excited I am
to be working with you.

02:02.733 --> 02:05.533
And congrats again
on the Pubbie.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.200
- Marketing is really...
my passion.

02:08.267 --> 02:10.067
- Oh, mine too.
That's where I got started.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.867
You can't believe
the number of duds

02:11.933 --> 02:13.233
that I've gotten
on the best-seller list

02:13.300 --> 02:15.067
with a good campaign.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.600
- Yes! I know exactly
what you're talking about.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.067
We are the unsung heroes!

- Hey! Google Maps
said an hour,

02:42.567 --> 02:43.833
but the sheep in front
of us said three, so...

02:43.900 --> 02:45.367
- Yeah, that's Ireland
for you.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.667
- Hi.
- Hey!

02:47.733 --> 02:50.133
Maggie, Liza,
this is my mum, Noreen.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.800
- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

- Oh, hi.

a picture?

- Oh, sure.

Okay.

- Oh, okay.

03:00.733 --> 03:01.867
- Say, "Tinahely."

all: Tinahely!

Clare, let's book an actual
photographer for the wedding.

Oh, and we need to get
the caterer's quote down

03:10.133 --> 03:11.767
and find a band.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.867
God, so much to do before
we get these two lovebirds

03:13.933 --> 03:15.933
in front
of Father Flannery.

03:16.067 --> 03:18.867
- You guys are going
to a lot of effort for this.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.900
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, why wouldn't we?

03:20.967 --> 03:22.333
- Because it's just
for a green--

03:22.400 --> 03:24.400
- Green--yeah, a green--
a green wedding.

03:24.467 --> 03:26.667
In America,
everyone likes to be "green."

03:26.733 --> 03:28.800
Not wasteful,
eco-friendly sort of thing.

03:28.867 --> 03:30.233
- Right.
- Oh.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.067
Well, in Ireland,
we like to have fun.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.267
And follow tradition.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.433
I best be off.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.100
I'll leave it to Clare
to give you the tour.

- Bye.
- See you later.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.067
- Bye, Mum.
- Bye.

03:41.633 --> 03:44.433
- Yes, this is still
a green card wedding,

03:44.500 --> 03:46.800
but no one here
knows about that.

03:46.867 --> 03:48.067
- What? How?
- You're kidding.

03:48.067 --> 03:49.567
- As soon as Mum found out,

03:49.633 --> 03:51.533
she went into
mother-of-the-bride overdrive.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.900
- Well, wouldn't it be easier

03:52.967 --> 03:55.067
just to be honest
with her?

03:55.133 --> 03:57.067
I'll shut up.

03:57.133 --> 03:59.200
- I know we should have been,
but it's too late now.

03:59.267 --> 04:01.500
So it's gonna be
a traditional country wedding

04:01.567 --> 04:02.933
with all the trimmings.

04:03.067 --> 04:05.067
- Josh, anything I can do
to help?

04:05.133 --> 04:07.400
I mean, could go suit shopping
with you or...

04:07.467 --> 04:09.633
- Uh, no.
I think we got it.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.200
Come on, Mags,
let's get you checked in.

04:11.267 --> 04:12.700
- Oh, okay. Awesome.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.700
- Do you want to head up
to Dublin with me?

04:14.767 --> 04:15.933
- Dublin?

04:16.067 --> 04:17.933
Yeah, I'd--I'd love to!

some fascinating ideas

04:28.267 --> 04:29.633
for "Marriage Vacation."

04:29.700 --> 04:31.967
- "Marriage Vacation"
is not his book.

04:32.067 --> 04:33.933
It's my book and Liza's.

04:34.067 --> 04:35.300
- Is Liza joining us?

04:35.367 --> 04:37.467
- Ah. I meant
to tell you, she is--

04:37.533 --> 04:39.167
- Chasing Josh around Ireland.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.067
- Really?
- I know.

04:43.133 --> 04:44.467
Leave without pay,
obviously.

04:44.533 --> 04:46.067
- She's working remotely.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.833
She put this marketing deck
together.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.067
- Thanks for the segue,
Peters.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.600
- No, I wasn't finished.
I--

04:50.667 --> 04:51.967
- "Good Morning America"
is interested

04:52.067 --> 04:53.333
in promoting the book.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.867
Their producer, Cece Jones--

04:54.933 --> 04:56.800
- Charles,
Cece is my contact.

04:56.867 --> 04:58.367
I met her at The Nest
a few weeks ago--

04:58.433 --> 05:00.800
- Cece and I
are old friends.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.367
She can give us two segments,

05:02.433 --> 05:03.800
with hero shots
of the book cover

05:03.867 --> 05:05.667
in and out
of commercial breaks.

05:05.733 --> 05:07.067
And she wants to include

05:07.133 --> 05:08.767
the real-life
"Marriage Vacation,"

05:08.833 --> 05:10.800
with you, Charles,
onstage with Pauline.

05:10.867 --> 05:13.067
Her return.
Your reconciliation--

05:13.067 --> 05:15.100
- Absolutely not.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.333
- But I thought you two
were back together.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.333
- We're selling a book, Zane,

05:20.400 --> 05:23.333
not exploiting
Charles' family for sales.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.900
- Kelsey's right.

05:24.967 --> 05:26.667
This is a little close
to home for me.

05:26.733 --> 05:28.533
- Of course.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.933
But I thought the angle
that Empirical was taking--

05:31.067 --> 05:32.867
- Millennial.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.800
- Millennial was taking
was that the book is about...

05:35.867 --> 05:38.467
two people finding their way
back to each other.

05:38.533 --> 05:40.233
- Wow.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.100
Way off.

05:42.167 --> 05:45.367
- Charles, having Pauline
and you on "GMA" would...

05:45.433 --> 05:47.133
help sell the narrative.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.700
- I don't think so.

05:48.767 --> 05:50.367
- Maybe we could let them
get a shot of you

05:50.433 --> 05:52.333
by the side of stage,
just a nod and wave.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.933
- I'll think about it.
We'll see.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.667
- Regardless,
I'll lock it in with Cece.

05:55.733 --> 05:57.600
Peters, shall we?

05:57.667 --> 05:59.167
- Already dialing.

06:02.133 --> 06:04.500
- So you and Pauline
are back together?

06:04.567 --> 06:06.633
- Uh, well, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't say that exactly.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.467
Uh, but she did move back in.

06:08.533 --> 06:11.267
Uh, the guest room.
You know, for the girls.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.933
- Typical.

06:13.067 --> 06:15.733
Richard and I
have recently parted ways.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.600
- Hmm.

- We're like ships
in the night.

[upbeat pop music]

06:25.533 --> 06:26.767

Yay! [laughs]

06:29.267 --> 06:31.633
Oh, so many photos.
My face hurts.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.867
- Oh, I know.
It's for the wedding book.

06:33.933 --> 06:35.467
- The photo album?

06:35.533 --> 06:37.133
- Uh, no, it's--
it's the book of evidence

06:37.200 --> 06:39.300
we need to apply
for my green card.

06:39.367 --> 06:42.967
We need photos, receipts,
ticket stubs.

06:43.067 --> 06:44.667
- Ugh, that sounds
like a lot of work.

06:44.733 --> 06:47.500
- Yeah, and then immigration
will interrogate us

06:47.567 --> 06:50.333
about the validity
of our marriage...

06:50.400 --> 06:52.200
our friends too.

06:52.267 --> 06:54.600
That's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.733
If they ask you
any questions...

06:57.800 --> 06:59.300
- Me?

06:59.367 --> 07:02.700
- Yeah, I mean, you and Josh
are so close.

07:02.767 --> 07:04.733
So if--if they ask you,
can you tell them

07:04.800 --> 07:07.600
that we got married
because we love each other?

07:07.667 --> 07:09.867
- But are you in love
with Josh?

07:09.933 --> 07:11.933
- Well, I-I love
that he's willing to do this

07:12.067 --> 07:15.667
so I can follow my dreams
in the States.

07:15.733 --> 07:19.067
He's amazing, right?

07:19.067 --> 07:20.600
- Yeah, he is.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.867
I can say, um--I can say
whatever you need me to say.

07:24.933 --> 07:26.800
- Thanks.

07:26.867 --> 07:29.500
And if they ask you how long
we've been together,

07:29.567 --> 07:32.733
could you say six months
instead of one?

07:32.800 --> 07:35.133
Six is just more...

07:35.200 --> 07:39.067
- Yeah, it is.
Six times more.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.900
- I know it's a lie,

07:40.967 --> 07:43.200
but it's a tiny white lie,

07:43.267 --> 07:48.067
like the one you had to tell
to, you know, get your job.

07:48.067 --> 07:49.533
- You know about that?

07:49.600 --> 07:50.800
- Yeah, of course.

07:50.867 --> 07:52.233
Josh and I
are getting married.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.367
We don't keep secrets
from each other.

07:54.433 --> 07:57.333
- Including this? Josh knows
you're asking me to do this?

07:57.400 --> 07:59.867
- Knows?
Liza, it was his idea.

08:00.067 --> 08:03.567
That's why he wants you here,
to bolster our story.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.333
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.867
From what he's told me,
you kind of owe him this, right?

08:08.933 --> 08:11.667
- Him or you?

08:11.733 --> 08:14.367
- Us.

[dramatic music]

08:23.400 --> 08:26.533
[upbeat Irish music]

08:26.600 --> 08:28.900
- Josh only invited me here
so I would lie for him.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.767
- There goes my peaceful
nature walk.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.967
Why did I ever leave Brooklyn?
I always regret it.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.567
- Sorry, it's just,
it's so insane!

08:34.633 --> 08:36.067
I'm not gonna lie
to Homeland Security.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.333
It's a felony.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.900
- That doesn't sound
like Josh.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.633
He hates lying,
and he hates liars.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.900
I mean, what the hell
is really bugging you, girl?

08:42.967 --> 08:45.467
- I just wish
he'd asked me himself.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.233
Something just doesn't
feel right about this.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.933
- Oh, don't make trouble.
You're not here

08:49.067 --> 08:51.067
to "My Best Friend's Wedding"
this wedding.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.900
- I'm not, and I won't.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.233
It's just, he's barely said

08:54.300 --> 08:55.767
two words to me
since I got here.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.567
I just feel like
this whole marriage

08:57.633 --> 08:59.100
is a reaction to everything
that's happened between us.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.500
- Wait, Liza!

09:00.567 --> 09:01.733
- And I think
he's rushing into I.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.600
- I'm back here!
Oh, no!

09:04.667 --> 09:05.933
- Oh, my God!

09:06.067 --> 09:08.067
- I'm sinking!

09:08.067 --> 09:09.500
Oh!

09:09.567 --> 09:12.633
I--oh, no!
- You're in a peat bog!

09:12.700 --> 09:14.400
- I read about that
in the in-flight magazine!

09:14.467 --> 09:15.633
It can swallow a horse!

09:15.700 --> 09:17.467
- Um, I can't--

09:17.533 --> 09:18.800
Okay, I'm gonna go get help!

09:18.867 --> 09:19.933
You stay there!

09:20.067 --> 09:22.467
- Hurry!
- [yelling]

09:40.667 --> 09:44.167
- Oh, thanks again, Noreen.
Lifesaver.

09:44.233 --> 09:45.833
- Oh, I could
have been a bog body.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.367
- Ha. It happens all the time.

09:47.433 --> 09:49.667
We lost our best calf
in that bog last week.

09:49.733 --> 09:52.633
- [exhales deeply]
- Oh, you're soaked through.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.100
- Well, my place
is just over the hill.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.533
You're welcome
to clean up there.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.467
You could probably do
with some hot tea.

09:57.533 --> 09:59.100
- Or an Irish coffee.

09:59.167 --> 10:00.600
- Strongest in the village.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.833
- Sold.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.667
- You go.
I got to find Josh.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.733
- Yeah, good luck.
And watch your step.

[upbeat music]

10:07.200 --> 10:09.667
[applause]

10:09.733 --> 10:11.100
- And welcome back
to "Good Morning America."

10:11.167 --> 10:12.800
We are here with
Pauline Turner-Brooks,

10:12.867 --> 10:14.667
who has written
this incredible book

10:14.733 --> 10:16.200
called "Marriage Vacation."

10:16.267 --> 10:17.967
- And not just a book
but what seems

10:18.033 --> 10:19.967
a thinly veiled version
of her very own life,

10:20.033 --> 10:21.467
her own marriage.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.833
- So, I mean, technically,
this is fiction,

10:22.900 --> 10:24.633
but how about we call it
"faction"?

10:24.700 --> 10:27.300
- Oh, my God, I love that.
"Faction." Can I quote you?

10:27.367 --> 10:29.233
So, uh, this is a story
about a woman...

10:29.300 --> 10:33.100
- This is quite the coup.

10:33.167 --> 10:35.400
Your ex
is a smooth operator.

10:35.467 --> 10:37.000
- He is not my ex.

10:37.067 --> 10:39.100
- Your F-U buddy, then?

10:39.167 --> 10:43.100
- It's just F. And no.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.133
- Pauline is a natural.
I think it's going great.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.200
- And I think it's not
what we agreed on.

10:48.267 --> 10:50.700
I asked for juicy content, Zane.
Juicy.

10:50.767 --> 10:52.167
We're stretching,
and we haven't even made it

10:52.233 --> 10:53.733
to the first
commercial break.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.333
I should have pulled
the segment the second

10:55.400 --> 10:57.100
the sexy husband refused
to go on the air.

10:57.167 --> 10:58.500
- Not gonna happen, sorry.

10:58.567 --> 10:59.733
- I'm cutting it, then.
Sorry.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.567
- Wait.
Okay, look.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.067
He told me no yesterday,

11:03.133 --> 11:06.067
but maybe if they
ask nicely on the air...

11:06.133 --> 11:07.667
- Did you just
give me permission?

11:07.733 --> 11:08.700
- Mm...

11:08.767 --> 11:11.300
[quirky music]

11:11.367 --> 11:13.200
- Zane, what is going on?

11:13.267 --> 11:14.700
What did you just say
to Cece?

11:14.767 --> 11:18.067
* *

11:18.067 --> 11:21.067
- Pauline, I've been told
your husband is here.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.800
- He is?
- Oh, yes.

11:22.867 --> 11:24.933
- How supportive,
after all the intimate details

11:25.067 --> 11:26.300
you revealed about him
in this book.

11:26.367 --> 11:28.467
- Oh, well,
that is a character.

11:28.533 --> 11:29.900
- But he's here?
Where is he?

11:29.967 --> 11:31.733
- Um, he's...
- Where? Where?

11:31.800 --> 11:33.367
Oh, that's him?

11:33.433 --> 11:35.167
- Come on out.
We'd love to talk to you.

11:35.233 --> 11:36.933
Audience, wouldn't we love
to hear from Charles?

11:37.067 --> 11:39.067
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, he doesn't--

11:39.067 --> 11:40.800
He's a little shy.
- Come on out.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.400
- Come on!
- They want to hear from you.

11:43.467 --> 11:46.600
- Oh, my God.
[laughter]

11:46.667 --> 11:48.600
- Welcome.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.300
[upbeat guitar music]

11:51.367 --> 11:53.300
- So tell me about yourself,
Maggie.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.867
- Well, I'm born in Queens.

11:55.933 --> 11:57.567
I'm an artist. I'm gay--

11:57.633 --> 11:59.800
- Oh!
- You sound surprised.

11:59.867 --> 12:01.767
I mean, they do have lesbians
here in Ireland, right?

12:01.833 --> 12:03.367
- We call them nuns.

12:03.433 --> 12:05.800
I was reacting
to "artist."

12:05.867 --> 12:08.867
'Cause I sort of fancy myself
as being one too.

12:08.933 --> 12:10.533
Not on your level, now.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.533
Can I show you something?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.367
[quirky music]

12:14.433 --> 12:16.133
- What are we looking at
here again?

12:16.200 --> 12:17.633
- [sighs]

12:17.700 --> 12:19.467
Ever since Clare's father
passed away,

12:19.533 --> 12:22.067
I keep painting
this same landscape.

12:22.067 --> 12:25.300
It's this image that just
comes to me in my dreams.

12:25.367 --> 12:27.400
These two rounded hills,

12:27.467 --> 12:30.167
and then there's this valley
where they meet,

12:30.233 --> 12:34.133
and right in the center,
there's an opening or a cave.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.067
I can't explain it.

12:36.133 --> 12:37.867
I've never been in there,
but I'd love to.

12:37.933 --> 12:39.167
I really would.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.100
- [chuckles softly]

12:42.167 --> 12:44.600
[stammering]
And what's that pink thing?

12:44.667 --> 12:46.800
- A boulder, I guess.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.067
Just a round little nubby
sort of thing

12:49.133 --> 12:51.267
right on top of the cave.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.100
You can touch it if you want.

12:53.167 --> 12:55.300
Actually, no.
It's still wet.

12:58.233 --> 13:00.367
You know...

13:00.433 --> 13:02.533
ever since
I lost my husband,

13:02.600 --> 13:07.133
I've thought about
being a nun.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.933
- No shit. [laughs]

13:09.067 --> 13:12.367
[upbeat Irish music]

13:12.433 --> 13:14.067

13:14.067 --> 13:15.467
- Well, there's no
turning back now, man.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.200
- Yeah.
- Your goose is cooked!

13:17.267 --> 13:19.933

we'll kill you.

13:20.067 --> 13:20.933
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

13:21.067 --> 13:22.167
- Yeah.

13:22.233 --> 13:23.567
Yeah, I got it.

13:26.067 --> 13:28.133
- Josh.
- Oh.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.467
- There you are.
- Hey. What's up, Liza?

13:30.533 --> 13:33.533
- Hey. I feel like
you've been avoiding me

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
ever since I got here.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.333
- No! No, no, no, no.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.500
This--this has been
totally wild.

13:39.567 --> 13:41.400
Way more than what I expected.

13:41.467 --> 13:43.567
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

13:43.633 --> 13:46.667
- I'm, um--I'm starting to feel
a little set up here, actually.

13:46.733 --> 13:49.267
- Oh. Oh, you mean 'cause
of the whole "six month" thing.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.600
Yeah.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.200
Look, if you don't want
to do it,

13:52.267 --> 13:53.500
it's totally cool.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.367
I understand.

13:55.433 --> 13:56.833
I mean, I don't--
I don't want to make you

13:56.900 --> 13:58.933
feel uncomfortable
or anything.

13:59.067 --> 14:01.733
- It does make me feel a little
uncomfortable, actually.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.200
This is a very official lie.

14:05.267 --> 14:06.733
Homeland Security?

14:06.800 --> 14:09.967
- So what you're basically
saying is,

14:10.067 --> 14:13.533
you'll lie for yourself,
but you won't lie for me.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.733
- Am I lying for you?

14:15.800 --> 14:17.433
Or am I lying to get Clare
a green card?

14:17.500 --> 14:22.400
- What? This is--
this isn't for her, Liza.

14:22.467 --> 14:24.800
This is for us.

14:24.867 --> 14:27.267
So we can be together
in New York City

14:27.333 --> 14:29.300
and see where this leads.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.300
Shit, really?

Clare is?

don't think you know either.

what we had planned.

of control, okay?

15:01.867 --> 15:03.233
Didn't she, Peters?

15:04.633 --> 15:06.067
I had nothing to do with that.

all those questions.

their upper body,

"inflame the boys."
