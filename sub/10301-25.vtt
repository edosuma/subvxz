01:18.340 --> 01:23.130
You know, Peg, it's kind of nice
sitting here like this with you.

01:24.020 --> 01:26.818
How many beers did you have
tonight, Al?

01:28.340 --> 01:29.853
Ten.

01:31.780 --> 01:35.693
So I guess we're about a six-pack
short of sex, huh?

01:36.380 --> 01:38.257
At least.

01:46.980 --> 01:49.733
Do I have juicy gossip.

01:49.980 --> 01:52.050
It's about cousin Jimmy.

01:52.420 --> 01:56.857
Did he find out our little Bud slept
with his bride on their wedding day?

01:57.060 --> 02:00.814
He must have. I heard he's getting
a divorce and coming to see Bud today.

02:01.020 --> 02:04.376
I think he's gonna squish
the little love critter.

02:12.060 --> 02:15.575
Well, here's the footstool of love now.

02:17.020 --> 02:19.659
Family, this is my lucky day.

02:19.860 --> 02:23.409
I was at school and there was one
of the great parties in all of history.

02:23.620 --> 02:26.532
A wet T-shirt contest.

02:26.740 --> 02:29.413
Large-hootered Midwestern
farm girls were sliding down...

02:29.620 --> 02:32.259
...this beer chute half-naked.

02:32.460 --> 02:36.738
There was dancing. There was loving.
My first big frat party.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.852
Just a great bunch of guys having
the time of their lives.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.210
And it took them a full 15 minutes
to see me...

02:42.420 --> 02:45.617
...peeking in the window
and kick me out.

02:45.820 --> 02:47.538
Dad, you should have seen them.

02:47.740 --> 02:50.891
There were big 'uns.
There were little 'uns.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.975
Round 'uns.

02:55.180 --> 02:57.740
Pear-shaped 'uns.

02:57.940 --> 03:02.331
Here an 'un, there an 'un,
everywhere an 'un-'un.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.291
Sure, like I'm the only Peeping Tom
in this family.

03:09.060 --> 03:12.769
Well, I guess you deserve to know,
tiny dancer.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.813
Cousin Jimmy is on his way over
to have a little chat with you.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.655
Wha-? What do you think he wants?

03:18.860 --> 03:21.533
Your bu- Butt in a sling.

03:25.500 --> 03:29.778
Oh, my God, that must be Jimmy.
You better run.

03:35.180 --> 03:37.216
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Hi, cousin Bud.

03:37.420 --> 03:40.651
Hi, cousin Kelly. Hi, Uncle Al.
Aunt Peggy.

03:40.860 --> 03:42.976
Hello, cousin Buck.

03:43.180 --> 03:46.092
It's too bad we only get together
at weddings and funerals.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.495
Step outside, Bud.

03:49.580 --> 03:52.253
Oh, all right, I'll handle this.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.451
Come on in, Jimmy.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.933
We heard the news. Congratulations.

03:58.140 --> 04:01.018
Anybody can eat 100 Whoppers.

04:02.220 --> 04:04.780
No, I'm talking about the breakup.

04:04.980 --> 04:08.450
Let's face it. You had the honeymoon,
that's the best part of the marriage.

04:08.660 --> 04:10.776
<i>If it goes any longer,
they turn into this:</i>

04:13.660 --> 04:15.890
<i>Then, if you're really unlucky,
you get these:</i>

04:18.019 --> 04:21.012
<i>Then you turn into this:</i>

04:22.620 --> 04:25.418
Yeah, but she was
the perfect woman.

04:25.620 --> 04:29.932
She was beautiful. She was rich.
And her parents are dead.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.375
Boy, you must really wanna
kill that guy.

04:32.580 --> 04:35.140
Kill him? I want to rend him.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.377
I want to rip off his arms,
shove one of them down his throat...

04:38.580 --> 04:40.696
...and have him tear out
his own heart.

04:40.900 --> 04:44.973
Anyway, Bud,
I need to talk to you. Bud?

04:48.820 --> 04:51.937
You crack me up.
Now get outside.

04:54.220 --> 04:55.448
I'll be right with you.

04:56.980 --> 05:01.212
Dad, I don't want him to pull
my arms off and rip out my heart.

05:01.420 --> 05:05.413
All I did was sleep with his wife.
What does he want from me?

05:05.620 --> 05:08.498
Now, Bud, just relax.
I know how to handle this.

05:08.700 --> 05:11.339
I met a lot of big, stupid bullies
when I was growing up.

05:11.700 --> 05:16.216
Al, when you were growing up,
you were the big, stupid bully.

05:16.420 --> 05:18.729
Yeah, I was.

05:18.940 --> 05:21.852
I was good at it too.
But I wasn't just big and stupid.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.891
I was also mean.

05:24.100 --> 05:28.491
I used to scare people
like your mother scares me.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.253
Dad, can you ox around later?
I'm facing death over here.

05:32.460 --> 05:35.816
All right, all right.
Now, here's what you do.

05:36.020 --> 05:37.851
As soon as he opens his mouth...

05:38.060 --> 05:41.097
...you punch him in the breadbasket
with everything you got.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.497
He'll drop faster than a stock
after I buy it.

05:46.020 --> 05:49.615
- Thanks, Dad.
- All right, now go get him. Go get him.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.733
Peg, looks like there will just be
three of us for dinner.

06:04.620 --> 06:08.135
Bud, I've got a dilemma.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.774
This thing's really eating me up.

06:17.820 --> 06:21.051
I gotta kill the guy
that did this to me.

06:24.540 --> 06:26.929
If only I knew who he was.

06:27.140 --> 06:29.210
So you don't know?

06:32.460 --> 06:34.894
All I know is that it's someone
on this block.

06:35.100 --> 06:39.457
I need your help. Find him for me.
It'll be just like when we were kids...

06:39.660 --> 06:41.890
...and someone was mad at you
and I'd beat him up.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.978
When he was unconscious
you'd come along and kick him.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.772
We were a great team then.
Can I count on you?

06:48.980 --> 06:51.494
- She really didn't tell you anything?
- No.

06:51.700 --> 06:55.375
I mean, not even that this guy was
the best she ever had?

06:55.580 --> 06:56.854
That he was good?

06:57.060 --> 07:00.257
Or at least even better than
a really tight pair of pants?

07:00.460 --> 07:03.338
No, she said it really
wasn't worth mentioning.

07:05.980 --> 07:08.096
That bitch.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.860
You're really mad, aren't you, Bud?

07:15.060 --> 07:16.812
That touches me.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.138
You let me know when you find
this guy, because I want him bad.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.018
Me too.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.455
Jimmy doesn't have a clue.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.412
He doesn't even know it was me.

07:45.620 --> 07:47.975
And the greatest thing is,
he's never gonna find out.

07:48.180 --> 07:49.613
I mean, who's gonna tell him?

07:49.820 --> 07:52.539
- Not me.
- Not me.

07:58.460 --> 08:03.011
Now, remember, Bud,
that's 100 strokes.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.452
Right, Kel.

08:06.660 --> 08:10.016
Eight, nine...

08:10.220 --> 08:15.248
...16, 44...

08:15.460 --> 08:18.020
...99, 100.

08:18.220 --> 08:19.699
Okay.

08:22.260 --> 08:25.730
It's a good thing you didn't cheat,
because I was counting along with you.

08:27.380 --> 08:30.975
You're a good slave
and a damn fine eunuch.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.216
You're not gonna tell Jimmy, right?

08:33.419 --> 08:36.809
Not as long as my little leprechaun
keeps granting my wishes.

08:37.260 --> 08:40.410
Now, don't forget to pick up
my cleaning...

08:40.620 --> 08:42.258
...hang up my pantyhose...

08:42.460 --> 08:45.930
Oh, and try not to get tangled up
in them this time.

08:47.540 --> 08:51.055
Hey, you do good work.
It's hard to believe you're straight.

08:54.620 --> 08:56.815
<i>Very hard.</i>

08:59.460 --> 09:02.657
Thanks for letting me use
your flea brush, Buck boy.

09:03.260 --> 09:07.094
<i>No problem. I've been using
your toothbrush for years.</i>

09:15.620 --> 09:16.973
Son, are we alone?

09:17.180 --> 09:18.659
- Yeah, Dad.
- Good.

09:18.860 --> 09:21.249
Then you're the only one
I have to get rid of.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.049
Dad, I need to talk to you.

09:26.260 --> 09:30.094
Why is it always me? Get a friend.

09:31.540 --> 09:36.091
Dad, cousin Jimmy's going crazy.
He says if I don't find out who it is...

09:36.300 --> 09:39.053
...he's gonna go up and down the block
and beat everyone up.

09:39.260 --> 09:42.855
I put the whole block in danger.
Am I doing the wrong thing by lying?

09:43.060 --> 09:45.176
Don't ever say that, son.

09:45.620 --> 09:50.057
The Bundy proud name was built
on a philosophy of lying.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.495
Well, lying and owing money.

09:52.980 --> 09:56.893
And perhaps beer.
Yes, lying, owing money, and beer.

09:57.100 --> 10:00.251
Only thing that separates us from
the Kennedys is they have the money.

10:02.700 --> 10:07.057
<i>Son, always remember
the Bundy credo:</i>

10:07.260 --> 10:09.615
<i>Lie when your wife is waking</i>

10:09.820 --> 10:12.812
<i>Lie when your belly's aching</i>

10:13.020 --> 10:15.659
<i>Lie when you know she's faking</i>

10:17.060 --> 10:20.894
Lie, sell shoes, and lie.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.373
- So that really is our family credo?
- No.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.889
<i>No, actually the family credo is:</i>

10:27.100 --> 10:29.933
<i>Hooters, hooters
Yum, yum, yum</i>

10:31.380 --> 10:34.736
<i>Hooters, hooters
On a girl that's dumb</i>

10:38.900 --> 10:42.939
But the father in me felt you needed
a wholesome message at this time.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.700
So lie to anyone you want
as long as nobody gets hurt.

10:46.540 --> 10:48.019
Dad, I'm afraid somebody will.

10:48.220 --> 10:51.018
Well, then someone in the family
doesn't get hurt, that's all.

10:51.220 --> 10:53.780
- Cousin Jimmy is family.
- Well, then the immediate fam-

10:53.980 --> 10:56.699
See? This is why I don't like
talking to you.

10:58.660 --> 11:01.538
So do anything you want
with anyone you want...

11:01.740 --> 11:05.176
...just as long as you don't
wear a dress.

11:15.540 --> 11:18.213
Your cousin Jimmy beat me up.

11:18.620 --> 11:21.896
And he tore my little horsy.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.930
He thinks I slept with his wife.

11:25.140 --> 11:28.018
Well, let him sleep with yours.
That ought to be the end of him.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.619
Look, he's your relative.
Do you know anything about it?

11:33.500 --> 11:36.856
Son, the Bundy credo.

11:38.540 --> 11:41.134
<i>Hooters, hooters
Yum, yum, yum</i>

11:42.180 --> 11:44.330
<i>Hooters, hooters
On a girl that's dumb</i>

11:46.420 --> 11:47.819
No, no.

11:48.020 --> 11:51.933
See, the boy means that
we don't know anything.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.378
It was the other credo, you idiot.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.613
Are you okay, Mr. D'Arcy?

12:05.540 --> 12:09.135
Never underestimate me.
I can handle myself. I'm an athlete.

12:09.340 --> 12:11.649
I run a lot, you know,
to stay in shape.

12:11.860 --> 12:15.330
So after he hit me a couple times,
I took off.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.334
He chased me,
but I was too much man for him.

12:19.540 --> 12:21.019
Left him in the dust.

12:21.220 --> 12:24.769
The last time I saw him,
he was puffing and panting.

12:24.980 --> 12:29.974
Yeah, you pay when you go up
against Jefferson D'Arcy.

12:31.020 --> 12:32.976
What made him think you were
the guilty one?

12:33.180 --> 12:34.932
He said he was looking
on the block...

12:35.140 --> 12:38.530
...for a great-looking guy
women find irresistible.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.610
Sometimes I wish
I looked like you two.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.570
No, that's not true.

12:51.460 --> 12:54.054
You slut.

12:57.900 --> 13:01.017
Tramp. Hussy. Libertine.

13:01.220 --> 13:03.370
I heard the whole story
from that young man.

13:03.580 --> 13:06.936
How dare you do the good and plenty
with another woman.

13:09.140 --> 13:12.576
And this is not the last thing
you're gonna lose.

13:13.700 --> 13:16.419
Look, I'm innocent.
Marcie, think rationally.

13:16.620 --> 13:20.852
If I wanted a young, pretty, sexy girl,
I never would've married you.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.655
Yeah, why go out
for a succulent steak...

13:24.860 --> 13:27.533
...when you got a dried-up strip
of beef jerky at home?

13:27.780 --> 13:30.248
Marcie. Marcie.

13:35.500 --> 13:39.732
I just had a couch-off
with Marilyn Strabits down the street.

13:39.940 --> 13:44.616
She was telling everyone that
she could out-sit me on the couch.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.499
But after about 20 hours...

13:46.700 --> 13:51.330
...she started cramping and crying
about wasting her life.

13:51.620 --> 13:52.894
Punk.

13:56.180 --> 13:58.250
Peggy, Jefferson cheated on me.

13:58.460 --> 14:02.135
Well, when you age and lose
your beauty, men cheat.

14:02.380 --> 14:04.735
It's not your looks
that keeps me here, Peg.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.498
It's mine.

14:08.660 --> 14:11.333
I don't think I can get anybody.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.491
Oh, I know I was asking for trouble...

14:13.700 --> 14:15.816
...when I married
such a good-looking man.

14:16.020 --> 14:19.137
I mean, what do I have
to keep a man like that?

14:23.580 --> 14:26.458
This is where you, as my friend,
are supposed to jump in...

14:26.660 --> 14:30.699
...and say that I'm pretty and sassy
and spunky, and yes, sexy...

14:30.900 --> 14:34.575
...in that late-7 Os, New York,
androgynous-band way.

14:38.620 --> 14:41.339
Can't you at least say that I have
a pleasing personality?

14:41.540 --> 14:44.008
You'd give that to any fat woman.

14:44.780 --> 14:48.455
You have
a very nice personality, Marcie.

14:48.660 --> 14:51.015
You bet your sweet ass.

14:51.780 --> 14:54.294
But I know Jefferson cheated on me
with that girl.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.694
It had to be him.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.492
The only males around at the time...

14:57.700 --> 15:00.612
...were Jefferson, Bud
and old man McGinty.

15:00.820 --> 15:04.176
The old man can barely walk or go
to the bathroom by himself, but still...

15:04.380 --> 15:08.009
...there's not a woman on the block
who wouldn't take him over Bud.

15:09.180 --> 15:11.978
Hey, you wanna keep it down
over there?

15:12.180 --> 15:14.648
How far away do you think I am?

15:14.900 --> 15:17.733
Peggy, what would you do
if Al cheated on you?

15:17.940 --> 15:19.817
Oh, that would never happen.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.057
He's like a big old
faithful hound dog.

15:23.260 --> 15:26.809
Nobody wants him
and he's not good for anything.

15:27.020 --> 15:29.136
But I've had him
since he was a puppy...

15:29.340 --> 15:32.218
...and he has his cute little ways.

15:47.260 --> 15:50.411
Excuse me, Marcie, I have to go.

15:53.140 --> 15:55.654
Hey, now, what do you want?

15:55.860 --> 16:00.012
You. You true-blue little pooh bear.

16:00.220 --> 16:03.098
Take me. Take me in the rubble
that is our bed.

16:03.300 --> 16:05.177
Well, I didn't do noth-

16:14.500 --> 16:17.651
<i>Well, mister, I'll tell you this:</i>

16:17.860 --> 16:21.739
You're not gonna be getting into
these pants ever again.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.259
And I mean that literally.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.418
I'm telling you, I'm not gonna let you
wear these pants.

16:28.100 --> 16:32.537
Well, obviously, you two people have
a beautiful, healthy marriage.

16:33.140 --> 16:35.938
But I can't be responsible
for breaking it up.

16:36.380 --> 16:38.530
This man didn't cheat on you.

16:38.740 --> 16:41.618
I'm the stud. The stallion.

16:41.820 --> 16:43.970
The king of them all, y'all.

16:46.300 --> 16:51.055
I, Bud Bundy, am the irresistible one
who broke up my cousin's marriage.

16:58.940 --> 17:02.171
Ring, ring. Hello, Mr. Bud?

17:02.380 --> 17:05.611
Yes, I do believe it's time
for my hair appointment.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.890
I got dweeb goo in my hair.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.771
I'm telling Jimmy.

17:13.980 --> 17:16.574
Save your breath, Hungry-Man dinner.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.808
You have no hold over me anymore.

17:22.020 --> 17:25.217
I've decided to tell Jimmy the truth
and take what comes.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.371
Oh, good, then I win twice.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.856
You were my slave and now
you're gonna be dead. Yay me.

17:32.420 --> 17:34.888
But, you know, this has been
very educational for me.

17:35.100 --> 17:38.536
I always thought if you had sex,
it would be the girl who died.

17:41.580 --> 17:43.172
I'll be right back, Peg.

17:43.380 --> 17:47.293
I must speak to the boy
about his sin.

17:47.980 --> 17:52.178
Bud, I must speak to you
about the Bundy philosophy.

17:52.380 --> 17:54.689
You must always tell the truth.

17:55.260 --> 17:58.332
Dad, I thought you said
the Bundy philosophy was to lie.

17:59.380 --> 18:03.214
It is, son.
I'm lying to your mother right now.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.336
I have to get ready to go bowling.

18:07.540 --> 18:11.294
So every time I point at you,
say, "Yes, Dad. "

18:12.820 --> 18:16.176
<i>And so I feel that:</i>

18:17.660 --> 18:19.093
Yes, Dad.

18:21.660 --> 18:22.888
Yes, Dad.

18:23.100 --> 18:26.934
Dad, I think what I did was wrong.

18:29.820 --> 18:31.776
Good point, Dad.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.857
Don't ad-lib, son.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.096
Yes, Dad. Dad...

18:37.300 --> 18:39.177
...I really don't feel good
about myself.

18:44.420 --> 18:48.095
Dad, I will never take something again
that's not mine.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.656
I swear this to you and the heavens
above. I'll never do it again.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.614
Son...

18:56.140 --> 18:57.937
...I see you're hurting...

18:58.140 --> 19:01.450
<i>...so I wanna say this to you
and I wanna say it sincerely:</i>

19:01.660 --> 19:03.696
Blah, blah, son.

19:12.700 --> 19:15.214
We are not finished yet.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.650
At least, I'm not.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.859
Jimmy. I'm glad you're here.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.493
I have something to tell you.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.497
God, you're big.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.974
I know who slept with your fiancée.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.171
- It was-
- Who cares?

19:39.380 --> 19:42.178
The past is just a frown
turned upside down.

19:42.380 --> 19:44.530
One must move on.

19:44.740 --> 19:46.651
I have found my one true love.

19:46.860 --> 19:49.772
Bud, meet Diana.

19:52.660 --> 19:53.934
Dee Anna.

19:54.140 --> 19:55.698
Whatever.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.294
Isn't she great?

19:57.500 --> 20:01.095
I don't know. I don't care.
I don't even look at girls. I don't know.

20:01.340 --> 20:05.174
Honey, I need to talk to Bud alone
for just one second.

20:05.780 --> 20:08.248
Bud, even though I just met her...

20:08.460 --> 20:10.769
...I'm gonna go out and get her
an engagement ring.

20:10.980 --> 20:13.369
I don't know if I'm just in love
with being in love...

20:13.580 --> 20:16.777
...or if it's that I'm so stupid,
I refuse to learn from my mistakes.

20:16.980 --> 20:20.256
Well, maybe you're just in love
with being stupid.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.928
Yet a third possibility.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.778
Listen, I gotta go...

20:25.980 --> 20:29.336
...but I'm gonna leave her here
with you, where she's safe.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.451
Because I can trust you.

20:32.220 --> 20:35.690
You're my best cousin,
you're my best friend...

20:35.900 --> 20:37.538
...and you're gonna be my best man.

20:40.620 --> 20:43.009
Hey, you're getting pretty big.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.811
Pretty soon, I'm not gonna be able
to do this anymore.

21:01.540 --> 21:04.213
How come you aren't looking at me?

21:04.460 --> 21:06.735
Don't you like me?

21:07.660 --> 21:10.254
No, you're a girl. Yuck.

21:13.180 --> 21:16.775
I find your indifference intoxicating.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.016
Look at me.

21:19.220 --> 21:20.778
No.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.376
This is thrilling.

21:23.980 --> 21:27.655
Take me. Take me now.

21:33.780 --> 21:35.099
You're my best cousin...

21:35.300 --> 21:38.690
...my best friend
and my best man.

21:53.140 --> 21:54.619
<i>Dad's right.</i>

21:54.820 --> 21:58.495
<i>If she'll flirt with me,
she'll flirt with anyone.</i>

21:59.300 --> 22:01.575
<i>She'll just hurt cousin Jimmy.</i>

22:01.940 --> 22:04.374
<i>I know what I have to do.</i>

22:06.780 --> 22:10.011
You're not good enough
for my cousin Jimmy...

22:10.420 --> 22:12.854
...but you're just perfect for me.

22:15.580 --> 22:18.652
Strike.
