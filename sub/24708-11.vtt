one of those, uh,
blue knit caps on.

-Right.
-He had gotten a hold of her and
was dragging her, and then...

15:24.465 --> 15:26.967
two men came
and chased him away.

15:26.967 --> 15:30.179
-Can you describe more
what he looked like? Uh--
-He was just a big nothing.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.223

I think he lives right
across the street there.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.684

-Yeah.

That was somethin', huh?

That was awful.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.342
Yep.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.844
With Jimmy,
you never knew
what was comin' next.

41:58.057 --> 42:00.142
You know
what it was about?

42:02.520 --> 42:05.314
Jimmy didn't tell me
what he was into.

42:06.774 --> 42:09.985
I knew him a long time.
I never knew either.

42:09.985 --> 42:13.948
Hmm.
I'll believe that
if you want me to.

You're the customer.

42:21.080 --> 42:24.583
Did Jimmy talk about me?

42:24.583 --> 42:29.588
He didn't need to say anything.
I could tell how fond he was.

42:31.966 --> 42:35.052
Did he tell you
if he slept with me?

42:35.052 --> 42:37.179
He didn't say.

42:39.974 --> 42:41.684
If he drugged me?

42:43.310 --> 42:47.189
No, babe.
That psycho snitch
didn't say.

42:47.189 --> 42:52.361
But I'll tell ya how
he had circulation problems
off bein' diabetic,

42:52.361 --> 42:57.491
and he did like to
add his little potions
to ladies' drinks.

Girls half-knocked out

your performance.

43:03.872 --> 43:06.709
Am I taking you wrong?

43:09.295 --> 43:13.465
Are you lookin' to, uh,
find out if he drugged you,

43:13.465 --> 43:16.051
or did you wanna score
some more fizzies?

43:18.387 --> 43:19.388
What?

Some girls like to get
somewhere without having
to say they wanna go.

I didn't know
whether you had fun
with Jimmy or not.

43:32.109 --> 43:35.863
You think I wanted
that to happen--
for him to do that to me?

43:35.863 --> 43:39.158
-My mistake.
-You're lucky
I don't arrest you.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.827
Oh-ho, yeah.
Call the cops.

43:41.827 --> 43:46.707
Tell 'em a wacko skirt in
Patrick's wants me arrested for
asking what she's doing here.
