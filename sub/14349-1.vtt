00:05.838 --> 00:08.338
Captain's log, stardate 1513.1

00:09.439 --> 00:12.773
Our position, orbiting planet M-113.

00:12.943 --> 00:14.271
On board the Enterprise,

00:14.736 --> 00:17.690
Mr. Spock, temporarily in command.

00:18.574 --> 00:20.317
On the planet...

00:20.492 --> 00:24.277
... the ruins of an ancient
and long-dead civilisation.

00:25.289 --> 00:27.781
Ship's surgeon McCoy and
myself are now beaming down

00:27.959 --> 00:30.284
to the planet's surface.

00:31.087 --> 00:32.286
Our mission,

00:32.464 --> 00:36.509
routine medical examination
of archaeologist Robert Crater

00:36.677 --> 00:38.883
and his wife Nancy.

00:39.054 --> 00:43.384
Routine, but for the fact that
Nancy Crater is that one woman

00:43.559 --> 00:46.015
in Dr. McCoy's past.

00:49.733 --> 00:52.306
Shall we pick some flowers, doctor?

00:53.070 --> 00:54.529
When a man visits an old girlfriend,

00:54.696 --> 00:57.152
she usually expects something like that.

00:57.324 --> 01:00.943
Is that how you get girls
to like you, by bribing them?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.739
Doesn't seem to be
anybody around, does there?

01:04.916 --> 01:06.327
Well, they'll be along.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.660
You rushed us down ten minutes early.

01:15.052 --> 01:17.045
Professor Crater?

01:17.888 --> 01:19.680
Professor?

01:19.849 --> 01:21.557
Mrs. Crater?

01:28.358 --> 01:30.517
Nervous, Dr. McCoy?

01:30.694 --> 01:33.067
Yeah, a little bit, I guess.

01:33.697 --> 01:37.446
Well, you see, we walked out of
each other's lives ten years ago.

01:37.618 --> 01:39.161
She married Crater, and for all I know,

01:39.329 --> 01:42.034
she may have forgotten me completely.

01:42.207 --> 01:44.034
Of all the bonehead ideas, Jim.

01:44.209 --> 01:47.246
How do I let myself in
for things like this?

01:51.425 --> 01:53.382
- Leonard.
- Nancy.

01:54.053 --> 01:56.212
Hello.

01:58.182 --> 01:59.214
It's good to see you.

01:59.642 --> 02:01.552
Let me look at you.

02:02.646 --> 02:04.389
You haven't aged a day.

02:09.195 --> 02:12.564
Oh, this is Captain Jim
Kirk of the Enterprise.

02:16.286 --> 02:19.073
Mrs. Crater. I've heard
a great deal about you.

02:19.414 --> 02:20.659
All good, I hope.

02:23.502 --> 02:25.210
And Crewman Darnell.

02:25.796 --> 02:27.588
How do you do, ma'am?

02:31.928 --> 02:33.090
Something wrong, Darnell?

02:33.888 --> 02:37.055
Excuse me, sir, but, ma'am, if I
didn't know better, I would swear

02:37.225 --> 02:40.096
that you were somebody I left
behind on Wrigley's Pleasure Planet.

02:40.270 --> 02:42.014
It's funny, you're
exactly like a girl that...

02:42.189 --> 02:43.767
A little less mouth, Darnell.

02:43.941 --> 02:46.017
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to...

02:46.819 --> 02:48.776
I mean, I know it's
impossible, of course.

02:49.530 --> 02:51.274
Why don't you step outside, Darnell.

02:51.699 --> 02:53.359
Yes, sir.

02:54.077 --> 02:55.702
Thank you, sir.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.199
Maybe I'll step outside too.

02:57.706 --> 02:58.785
What?

02:59.291 --> 03:02.209
And let Plum examine me all alone?

03:02.461 --> 03:05.083
- Plum?
- Plum.

03:07.633 --> 03:11.299
A nickname I gave Leonard
when we were very young.

03:11.471 --> 03:16.466
I'll... I'll wait for the professor,
and I'll catch you both at once.

03:17.352 --> 03:19.475
I'd better go get Bob.

03:19.646 --> 03:24.309
Every time he starts digging, he
forgets time, sleep, food, everything.

03:24.485 --> 03:26.145
Be back in a minute.

03:30.492 --> 03:32.116
It's quite warm here, isn't it?

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:59.857 --> 04:03.641
Space, the final frontier.

04:03.820 --> 04:07.403
These are the voyages of
the starship Enterprise.

04:07.574 --> 04:12.450
Its five-year mission: To
explore strange new worlds,

04:12.788 --> 04:15.540
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

04:16.500 --> 04:20.000
to boldly go where no
man has gone before.

04:57.086 --> 05:00.456
Captain's log, additional entry.

05:00.632 --> 05:02.256
Since our mission was routine,

05:02.425 --> 05:05.676
we had beamed down to the
planet without suspicion.

05:06.138 --> 05:09.258
We were totally unaware that
each member of the landing party

05:09.433 --> 05:13.894
was seeing a different woman,
a different Nancy Crater.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.098
Professor Crater, I'm Captain Kirk.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.307
This is...

05:19.486 --> 05:21.194
The heroic captain
and the intrepid doctor

05:21.363 --> 05:24.613
cross interstellar space
to preserve our health.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.112
Your sense of duty is overwhelming.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.657
Now, will you please go
back where you came from

05:28.829 --> 05:32.163
and tell whoever issues your orders
to leave me and my wife alone?

05:32.333 --> 05:34.955
We need additional
salt against the heat.

05:35.128 --> 05:37.251
Aside from that, we're
doing very well, thank you.

05:37.422 --> 05:39.166
I'm pleased to hear you're doing well,

05:39.341 --> 05:41.132
but I'm required to confirm that fact.

05:41.301 --> 05:43.128
Doubtless, the good surgeon

05:43.303 --> 05:47.254
will enjoy prodding and poking
us with his arcane machinery.

05:47.433 --> 05:49.924
Go away, we don't want you.

05:50.102 --> 05:52.428
What you want is unimportant right now.

05:52.605 --> 05:55.275
What you will get is what
is required by the book.

05:55.442 --> 05:58.858
Quote, "All research personnel
on alien planets are required

05:59.029 --> 06:02.149
to have their health
certified by a starship surgeon

06:02.324 --> 06:03.902
at one-year intervals."

06:04.076 --> 06:06.828
Like it or not, professor, as
commander of the ship, I'm required...

06:06.996 --> 06:10.365
To show your gold braid to
everyone. You love it, don't you?

06:10.667 --> 06:13.703
He's all yours, Plum. Dr. McCoy.

06:15.255 --> 06:16.833
Sit down and breathe deeply, please.

06:17.007 --> 06:19.165
Did I hear you call him Dr. McCoy?

06:19.343 --> 06:20.837
You did.

06:24.724 --> 06:26.301
McCoy.

06:27.685 --> 06:30.176
I've heard Nancy speak of a Dr. McCoy.

06:30.355 --> 06:32.063
Well, that's me. Didn't
she mention I was here?

06:32.232 --> 06:34.438
You..? You've seen Nancy?

06:34.609 --> 06:35.689
She went out to get you.

06:35.861 --> 06:38.019
You've seen her too. You
were with the good doctor.

06:38.197 --> 06:39.228
Yes, why?

06:40.449 --> 06:42.987
Nothing. It's just that it
gives me great pleasure to know

06:43.160 --> 06:47.075
that she's gotten to see an old friend
and has a chance for some company.

06:47.248 --> 06:50.368
It's different for me. I enjoy solitude.

06:50.544 --> 06:54.707
But for a woman... You
understand, of course.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.455
Well, it certainly hasn't aged her.

06:57.635 --> 07:00.552
She looks exactly as I
knew her 12 years ago.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.295
Amazing, Jim, like a girl of 25.

07:03.474 --> 07:04.885
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, captain.

07:05.059 --> 07:07.681
Sit down. I seem to have
forgotten my manners.

07:07.854 --> 07:09.432
It's quite all right.

07:12.150 --> 07:13.693
I'm not joking, Jim.

07:13.861 --> 07:16.613
She hasn't aged a day. There's
not a grey hair on her head.

07:16.780 --> 07:19.069
She's got some grey, Bones.

07:19.242 --> 07:21.199
Excuse me, professor.
She's a handsome woman, yes,

07:21.369 --> 07:23.825
but hardly 25.

07:28.543 --> 07:32.755
You've seen my wife with the eyes
of your past attachment, doctor.

07:32.923 --> 07:35.593
I'm sure when Nancy lets...

07:35.760 --> 07:39.971
When you see her again,
she'll be of a believable age.

07:40.431 --> 07:42.887
Well, at any rate, she
doesn't look a day over 30.

07:43.059 --> 07:44.139
Genuine affection.

07:44.311 --> 07:47.762
I'm glad you still feel it for her.

07:47.940 --> 07:49.648
Leonard, isn't it?

07:49.817 --> 07:52.106
- She's a fine woman.
- Open your mouth.

07:52.278 --> 07:53.476
Why, I thought the machine was...

07:53.654 --> 07:55.777
The machine is capable
of almost anything,

07:55.948 --> 07:58.356
but I'll still put my trust
in a healthy set of tonsils.

07:58.534 --> 07:59.733
Now, open your mouth.

08:25.647 --> 08:27.142
McCoy.

08:29.568 --> 08:31.063
Dead, Jim.

08:31.237 --> 08:35.448
It's strange, the red
mottling all over his face.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.408
- What happened?
- What do you suppose happened?

08:37.577 --> 08:39.404
You beamed down a crewman
who doesn't know better

08:39.578 --> 08:42.783
- than to eat an untested plant.
- I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.073
I wanna know what happened.

08:44.877 --> 08:46.122
Well, I...

08:46.795 --> 08:47.827
I...

08:48.506 --> 08:49.751
Take it easy, Nancy.

08:49.924 --> 08:52.083
Just tell us what you know.

08:54.596 --> 08:55.794
Well, I was just...

09:01.103 --> 09:04.437
I couldn't find Bob,
and I was coming back.

09:05.024 --> 09:06.518
I crossed to your crewman.

09:07.026 --> 09:08.306
I wanted him to know

09:08.486 --> 09:10.977
I wasn't offended by the
things he'd said back there.

09:13.032 --> 09:14.859
You remember.

09:17.788 --> 09:19.116
Then I...

09:20.708 --> 09:23.828
I noticed he had a
Borgia plant in his hand.

09:24.879 --> 09:26.587
Before I could say anything, he'd...

09:26.756 --> 09:30.540
He'd taken a bite from it, and he fell.

09:31.594 --> 09:34.928
His face all twisted.

09:38.018 --> 09:40.011
Leonard, you look at me
like you don't believe me.

09:40.187 --> 09:41.681
No. No, no, no, it's not that at all.

09:41.856 --> 09:44.062
It's something entirely different.

09:49.364 --> 09:52.235
Jim, I suppose we could complete
these examinations later.

09:52.409 --> 09:55.196
We don't need an
examination, you can see that.

09:55.370 --> 09:57.244
Perhaps you'd better
take your man and...

09:57.414 --> 09:59.324
We're well aware of our
next duties, professor.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.038
We'll complete your
examinations tomorrow.

10:05.632 --> 10:06.663
Transporter Room.

10:06.841 --> 10:08.004
Transporter Room, captain.

10:08.176 --> 10:10.085
Lock onto us. Three beaming up.

10:10.262 --> 10:11.507
Locked onto you, captain.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.515
Salt. You did ask him
about more salt tablets?

10:14.683 --> 10:17.768
I'll take care of the
provisioning, Nancy.

10:34.079 --> 10:35.953
Miss Uhura, your last subspace log

10:36.123 --> 10:38.496
contained an error in
the frequencies column.

10:38.668 --> 10:40.376
Mr. Spock, sometimes I think

10:40.545 --> 10:43.463
if I hear that word
"frequency" once more, I'll cry.

10:45.467 --> 10:46.926
Cry?

10:47.427 --> 10:50.761
I was just trying to
start a conversation.

10:52.474 --> 10:54.432
Well, since it is illogical

10:54.602 --> 10:58.682
for a communications officer
to resent the word "frequency,"

10:59.023 --> 11:02.606
- I have no answer.
- No, you have an answer.

11:02.777 --> 11:04.402
I'm an illogical woman,

11:04.571 --> 11:09.068
who's beginning to feel too much a
part of that communications console.

11:09.994 --> 11:12.864
Why don't you tell me I'm
an attractive young lady.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.826
Or ask me if I've ever been in love.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.452
Tell me how your planet
Vulcan looks on a lazy evening

11:19.629 --> 11:21.337
when the moon is full.

11:23.842 --> 11:26.131
Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura.

11:26.303 --> 11:29.507
I'm not surprised, Mr. Spock.

11:30.349 --> 11:33.516
Transporter Room to bridge.
Landing party returning.

11:33.686 --> 11:35.975
They report one death.

11:37.607 --> 11:39.434
Bridge, acknowledging.

11:41.778 --> 11:44.270
I don't believe it.

11:44.656 --> 11:46.317
- Explain.
- You explain.

11:46.492 --> 11:50.490
That means that somebody is
dead, and you just sit there.

11:50.663 --> 11:51.694
It could be Captain Kirk.

11:51.873 --> 11:53.700
He's the closest thing
you have to a friend.

11:53.875 --> 11:55.702
Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern

11:55.877 --> 11:57.371
will not change what has happened.

11:57.546 --> 11:59.170
The Transporter Room is very well manned

11:59.339 --> 12:01.462
and they will call me if
they need my assistance.

12:10.226 --> 12:13.642
- She called it a Borgia plant.
- Something new to me.

12:13.813 --> 12:15.687
Bridge to Dispensary.

12:15.857 --> 12:16.889
Go ahead, Mr. Spock.

12:17.067 --> 12:19.060
Borgia plant listed
in library record tapes

12:19.236 --> 12:23.364
as Carbon Group III vegetation,
similar to Earth nightshade family.

12:23.574 --> 12:27.654
Alkaloid poison, chemical structure
common to most Class-M planets.

12:27.829 --> 12:31.162
About the strange mottling
on his facial skin surface,

12:31.332 --> 12:32.910
there is no reference to this symptom.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.255
Well, then this man wasn't poisoned.

12:37.881 --> 12:39.673
Stand by, Mr. Spock.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.217
She said she saw him eat the plant.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.674
She's mistaken. I know alkaloid
poison and what to look for.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.305
There's not a trace of it in his body.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.588
There were bits in his mouth.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.094
Jim, don't tell me my business.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.430
He could not have swallowed any.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.595
My instruments would have
picked up any trace of it.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.476
- Then what kills a healthy man..?
- Now, I'll tell you something else.

12:54.650 --> 12:57.437
This man shouldn't be dead. I
can't find anything wrong with him.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.271
According to all the
tests, he should get up

12:59.446 --> 13:02.020
and just walk away from here.

13:07.705 --> 13:09.116
I don't know.

13:09.291 --> 13:13.123
I'll have the tests double-checked.
My eyes may be tricking me.

13:15.589 --> 13:17.498
But I swear, Jim, when I first saw her,

13:17.675 --> 13:20.842
she looked just as I'd
known her ten years ago.

13:21.012 --> 13:23.633
Granted, at the moment, I
may have been looking at her

13:23.806 --> 13:24.886
through a romantic haze.

13:25.058 --> 13:27.181
How your lost love affects
your vision, doctor,

13:27.352 --> 13:29.179
doesn't interest me. I've lost a man.

13:29.354 --> 13:30.635
I wanna know what killed him.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.815
Yes, sir.

13:44.704 --> 13:48.654
Captain's log, stardate 1513.4.

13:48.834 --> 13:51.503
In orbit around planet M
- 113.

13:52.379 --> 13:54.835
One crewman, member
of the landing party...

13:55.800 --> 13:58.836
... dead by violence. Cause unknown.

13:59.595 --> 14:02.383
But we are certain the cause
of death was not poison.

14:02.557 --> 14:04.301
Message, captain.

14:04.476 --> 14:05.639
Starship base on Corinth IV,

14:05.811 --> 14:08.516
requesting explanation
of our delay here, sir.

14:08.689 --> 14:12.687
Space Commander Dominguez says we
have supplies he urgently needs.

14:13.694 --> 14:16.102
Tell JosÃ© he'll get his chilli
peppers when we get there.

14:16.280 --> 14:19.032
Tell him they're prime Mexican
reds. I handpicked them myself.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.193
He won't die if he goes a
few more days without them.

14:21.369 --> 14:23.077
- Got it?
- Got it, captain.

14:23.246 --> 14:24.705
Well?

14:25.290 --> 14:26.868
No mistake in our record tapes.

14:27.042 --> 14:30.162
Borgia plant. Sole deadly
property is alkaloid poison.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.618
And Professor Crater and wife?

14:31.797 --> 14:33.173
Check out perfectly.

14:33.341 --> 14:35.749
They arrived here nearly five years ago,

14:35.927 --> 14:38.299
visited by various vessels,

14:38.471 --> 14:42.766
made fairly heavy shipments
out of artefacts and reports.

14:42.935 --> 14:47.478
However, there has been a marked drop
in shipments during the last year.

14:47.648 --> 14:49.688
Dispensary to captain.

14:51.068 --> 14:53.227
- Kirk here.
- We found something.

14:53.404 --> 14:56.655
- What is it?
- I'd rather not put it on the speaker.

15:06.210 --> 15:07.241
Fascinating.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.080
So improbable we almost didn't check it.

15:09.255 --> 15:11.082
- What?
- Sodium chloride.

15:11.257 --> 15:12.288
Not a trace of it.

15:12.467 --> 15:13.961
This man has no salt in his body at all.

15:14.135 --> 15:15.795
Can you explain that, doctor?

15:15.971 --> 15:17.679
I can't.

15:18.890 --> 15:22.176
Except what we normally carry
in our bodies is gone from his.

15:22.353 --> 15:23.681
He would die almost instantly.

15:23.854 --> 15:25.230
How? There's no mark on his body.

15:25.398 --> 15:27.106
Except the red rings on his face.

15:27.275 --> 15:28.983
You called that skin mottling.

15:29.152 --> 15:31.358
I thought it was, sir.

15:31.946 --> 15:33.441
Another error on my part.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.692
I'm not counting them, Bones.

15:38.996 --> 15:42.780
- Are you in the mood for an apology?
- Forget it.

15:42.958 --> 15:44.204
I probably was mooning over her.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.919
I should have been
thinking about my job.

15:46.087 --> 15:47.629
Perhaps you were.

15:47.797 --> 15:49.375
Both Nancy and Crater
went out of their way

15:49.549 --> 15:51.756
to mention one item they needed.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.801
Salt tablets.

15:53.970 --> 15:55.381
Mr. Spock,

15:55.555 --> 15:56.801
outfit a landing party.

15:56.974 --> 15:59.050
We're beaming down with some questions.

16:05.274 --> 16:07.600
One might think that you
had more important duties

16:07.777 --> 16:09.485
than harassing people, captain.

16:09.654 --> 16:11.197
I have, professor. Believe me, I have.

16:11.364 --> 16:13.322
Where is Mrs. Crater? I
want to talk to her too.

16:13.492 --> 16:16.030
Captain, you can't just beam down here

16:16.203 --> 16:17.781
and bully us and
interfere with our work.

16:17.955 --> 16:20.493
Mrs. Crater. I won't ask again.

16:20.958 --> 16:22.239
Possibly at the other diggings.

16:22.418 --> 16:24.411
- We don't keep military logs here.
- Green, find her.

16:24.587 --> 16:26.212
Yes, sir.

16:27.632 --> 16:29.376
- Mr. Spock.
- Standing by.

16:29.551 --> 16:31.793
Sturgeon, transport a sample
of the plant to Mr. Spock.

16:31.970 --> 16:33.678
We'll check if it's
actually the Borgia plant

16:33.847 --> 16:35.970
or something we don't understand.
You got that, Mr. Spock?

16:36.141 --> 16:38.633
- Complete analysis.
- Captain...

16:38.811 --> 16:40.519
...considering the inescapable fact

16:40.688 --> 16:42.230
that you are a
trespasser on my planet...

16:42.398 --> 16:45.068
Your complaint is noted, sir.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.523
Look...

16:47.154 --> 16:50.439
...something we don't
understand killed one of my men.

16:50.616 --> 16:53.533
It could prove to be a danger
to you and Mrs. Crater too.

16:53.702 --> 16:55.660
We've been here for almost five years.

16:55.830 --> 16:58.747
If there were anything hostile here,

16:58.916 --> 17:00.292
we would know about it, wouldn't we?

17:00.460 --> 17:02.868
Bones, tell the professor
what the autopsy revealed.

17:03.046 --> 17:05.252
Our crewman died of salt depletion,

17:05.423 --> 17:07.415
a sudden total loss of it.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.669
Medically impossible by any standards.

17:09.845 --> 17:12.134
And by coincidence,
both you and Mrs. Crater

17:12.306 --> 17:14.464
requested salt tablets.

17:15.059 --> 17:19.520
And your esteemed physician cannot
explain our need for salt tablets?

17:19.689 --> 17:21.348
We're all aware of the need for salt

17:21.523 --> 17:24.976
on a hot and arid planet
like this, professor.

17:25.404 --> 17:29.153
But it's a mystery, and
I don't like mysteries.

17:29.325 --> 17:31.697
They give me a bellyache,
and I got a beauty right now.

17:37.292 --> 17:40.625
Nancy and I started with 25 pounds.

17:41.671 --> 17:42.917
This is what we have left.

17:43.090 --> 17:46.423
Now, what is so mysterious about that?

17:53.559 --> 17:55.054
Salt.

18:01.944 --> 18:03.354
One of the missions of the Enterprise

18:03.529 --> 18:05.189
is to protect human
life in places like this.

18:05.364 --> 18:07.938
I'm gonna have to ask you and
Mrs. Crater to stay aboard my ship

18:08.117 --> 18:10.442
until we find out what
killed that crewman.

18:10.620 --> 18:13.407
- But you can't do that.
- But I can, professor.

18:13.581 --> 18:14.613
You mustn't do it,

18:14.791 --> 18:16.333
- it'll interfere with our work.
- How?

18:16.501 --> 18:19.870
You've been here five years. Will
a couple of days make a difference?

18:25.928 --> 18:27.257
- Mr. Spock.
- Spock here.

18:27.430 --> 18:29.672
Arrange quarters for
Professor and Mrs. Crater.

18:29.849 --> 18:31.012
Did you get the plant analysis?

18:31.184 --> 18:32.643
It is the Borgia variety, captain.

18:32.811 --> 18:35.598
Could not have caused Darnell's death.

18:35.897 --> 18:38.104
Jim, he's run off.

18:44.615 --> 18:46.489
Nancy!

18:48.328 --> 18:49.608
You!

18:49.787 --> 18:51.412
Salt!

18:52.749 --> 18:55.240
I've got salt. Smell it.

18:55.419 --> 18:58.420
- Smell it, Nancy.
- Professor Crater!

18:58.589 --> 19:00.712
Professor Crater.

19:06.306 --> 19:08.345
Professor Crater.

19:13.355 --> 19:14.434
Professor Crater.

19:15.232 --> 19:16.940
Professor!

19:17.693 --> 19:20.564
- Professor.
- Jim. Jim.

19:20.863 --> 19:22.441
It's Sturgeon.

19:25.201 --> 19:26.993
He's dead.

19:28.705 --> 19:31.196
We'd better locate Crewman Green. Green!

19:32.376 --> 19:34.415
Green!

19:36.505 --> 19:38.831
Crewman Green, report!

19:39.258 --> 19:41.050
Green!

19:43.555 --> 19:45.880
Crewman Green, report.

19:50.938 --> 19:52.895
Green.

19:54.233 --> 19:56.938
Green, where are you?

19:58.738 --> 20:00.232
Could it be Crater? He came this way.

20:00.406 --> 20:01.949
I don't know.

20:03.576 --> 20:05.285
Green!

20:06.913 --> 20:08.076
- Did you see this?
- Yes, sir.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.956
Sturgeon was dead when I found him.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.581
I was circling to find whatever it was.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.254
Same red rings on his face.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.001
Have you seen Nancy? Mrs. Crater?

20:19.177 --> 20:21.882
No, sir. I checked
all through the ruins.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.600
I'm worried about her. She's not at
the quarters, not at the diggings.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.926
- She could be in trouble. Nancy!
- Crater!

20:28.604 --> 20:29.979
Nancy, it's Leonard!

20:30.147 --> 20:32.223
- We're beaming aboard the ship.
- You can't leave her.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.024
We can't search this
whole planet on foot.

20:34.193 --> 20:35.735
Learn something from Mr. Spock, doctor.

20:35.903 --> 20:37.102
Stop thinking with your glands.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.739
We have equipment aboard the Enterprise

20:38.907 --> 20:40.983
that could pinpoint a match
lit anywhere on this planet

20:41.159 --> 20:42.535
or the heat of a body.

20:42.702 --> 20:44.446
Transporter Room, Kirk speaking.

20:45.289 --> 20:47.080
Three to beam up.

21:11.818 --> 21:12.980
- Kirk to bridge.
- Spock here.

21:13.152 --> 21:14.777
Break out the surface search equipment.

21:14.946 --> 21:17.983
- I want coordinates on two people.
- Acknowledged.

21:18.158 --> 21:19.486
There's a body down there. Sturgeon.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.783
We'll bring him home, sir.

21:23.038 --> 21:24.746
You could use some sleep, Bones.

21:24.915 --> 21:26.742
All right, Jim.

21:42.393 --> 21:43.935
Bridge.

22:02.164 --> 22:04.157
Oh, Green, what went on down there?

22:09.631 --> 22:11.754
Who do you think you are?

22:19.016 --> 22:21.341
Something odd, captain.

22:21.769 --> 22:22.884
You said two people.

22:23.062 --> 22:24.343
Professor and Nancy Crater.

22:24.522 --> 22:26.349
We get a reading on only one person.

22:26.524 --> 22:28.351
Probably Crater.

22:28.526 --> 22:31.397
He's circling, as if
searching for something.

22:31.571 --> 22:35.071
- Expand search radius.
- Yes, sir.

22:41.666 --> 22:43.908
Why don't you go chase an asteroid.

22:44.085 --> 22:46.659
Hey, Janice, is that for me?

22:46.838 --> 22:49.127
Don't you wish it was.

22:50.634 --> 22:51.879
How about that?

22:52.052 --> 22:53.428
Yeah, how'd you like to have her

22:53.595 --> 22:55.588
as your own personal yeoman?

23:17.205 --> 23:18.319
Where are you, Sulu?

23:18.498 --> 23:20.040
In here, feeding the weepers, Janice.

23:20.208 --> 23:22.117
Well, I've got your tray.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.537
May the great bird of the
galaxy bless your planet.

23:24.713 --> 23:25.993
Thank you.

23:26.173 --> 23:27.548
Hello, Beauregard.

23:27.716 --> 23:29.792
How are you today, darling?

23:29.969 --> 23:31.000
Her name's Gertrude.

23:31.178 --> 23:33.136
No, it's a he plant.

23:33.305 --> 23:34.634
A girl can tell.

23:34.807 --> 23:37.512
Why do people have to call
inanimate objects "she"?

23:37.685 --> 23:39.559
Like, "She's a fast ship."

23:39.729 --> 23:42.303
He is not an inanimate object.

23:42.482 --> 23:44.808
He's so animate, he makes me nervous.

23:46.028 --> 23:50.322
In fact, I keep expecting one of
these plants of yours to grab me.

24:14.434 --> 24:16.308
Hello, Green.

24:22.067 --> 24:23.478
He's not talking today.

24:30.284 --> 24:32.526
You been nipping Saurian
brandy or something?

24:54.895 --> 24:58.228
Take it easy. Calm down.

24:58.524 --> 24:59.722
Very sensitive.

24:59.900 --> 25:01.276
He's the real spook.

25:01.443 --> 25:03.187
Suppose he's going
space-happy or something?

25:21.590 --> 25:24.378
Hey, the door to my quarters
still rattles when it opens.

25:24.552 --> 25:27.423
Would you stop by and see if
you can do something about it?

25:27.597 --> 25:29.673
Thanks, Bobby.

25:46.701 --> 25:48.030
Crewman...

25:48.370 --> 25:49.781
...do I know you?

25:49.955 --> 25:51.994
In a way, ma'am.

25:52.166 --> 25:55.120
You were just thinking
of someone like me.

25:57.797 --> 26:00.288
I'm guessing, of course, but
you do look a little lonely.

26:00.466 --> 26:02.293
I see.

26:02.468 --> 26:04.794
So naturally, when I'm
lonely I think of you.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.273
You're Swahili?

26:23.325 --> 26:25.816
Lieutenant Uhura to the bridge.

26:37.006 --> 26:39.332
Lieutenant Uhura to the bridge.

26:41.011 --> 26:43.134
I better get this tray
back. Bye, Beauregard.

26:43.305 --> 26:45.843
Wait a minute. I'll walk along.

26:46.183 --> 26:49.184
Lieutenant Uhura, report to the bridge.

26:53.858 --> 26:57.192
Lieutenant Uhura. On my way, sir.

27:21.305 --> 27:24.057
McCoy to bridge. Captain there?

27:24.475 --> 27:26.135
Kirk here. Nothing to report, doctor.

27:26.310 --> 27:27.769
We haven't located Mrs. Crater.

27:27.937 --> 27:30.060
- What's the matter, can't you sleep?
- Nope.

27:30.231 --> 27:33.351
Try taking one of those red
pills you gave me last week.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.069
You'll sleep.

28:02.766 --> 28:04.724
The simple fact is...

28:05.228 --> 28:08.015
...unless there's something seriously
wrong with the ship's equipment,

28:08.189 --> 28:10.763
there's only one person
within a hundred-mile circle.

28:10.942 --> 28:13.149
All right, we'll triangulate on him.

28:13.320 --> 28:16.654
We'll let Professor Crater
explain what happened to his wife.

28:18.993 --> 28:20.950
Remember my instructions, lieutenant.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.614
Keep a tight fix on us.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.947
If we let out a yell, I want
an armed party down there

28:25.124 --> 28:27.117
- before the echo dies.
- Yes, captain.

28:57.118 --> 28:58.826
Nancy.

28:59.996 --> 29:01.158
Well, come in, come in.

29:01.330 --> 29:03.489
I've been worried sick about you.

29:06.836 --> 29:08.663
I wonder why Jim didn't
tell me he found you.

29:08.839 --> 29:11.294
I'm so happy to see you, Leonard.

29:11.467 --> 29:13.506
The others, they... Well, I...

29:13.677 --> 29:15.836
I don't relate to them
as much as with you.

29:16.013 --> 29:18.587
You have such strong memories of me.

29:18.766 --> 29:22.100
- Well, I...
- You do care, don't you, Leonard?

29:23.730 --> 29:25.889
It makes me feel so...

29:26.858 --> 29:28.768
So safe.

29:29.027 --> 29:30.438
Nancy...

29:30.612 --> 29:32.356
My husband?

29:35.243 --> 29:37.994
I like your feelings better.

29:38.246 --> 29:39.705
Much...

29:40.415 --> 29:42.289
...stronger.

29:45.629 --> 29:47.705
But you're tired.

29:48.006 --> 29:50.213
You need to rest.

29:51.886 --> 29:54.092
You're as bad as Jim Kirk.

29:54.263 --> 29:56.719
He's been telling me to take these.

29:56.891 --> 29:58.931
Well, I think you should.

29:59.102 --> 30:01.344
I'll get you some water.

30:10.948 --> 30:13.155
Look at his face!

30:14.535 --> 30:16.908
Bridge, Sulu. Trouble
on Deck 9, Section 2.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.120
We need a medical team.

30:29.552 --> 30:32.257
Captain's log, stardate 1513.8.

30:32.430 --> 30:35.100
I am now certain that the
violent death of my crewman

30:35.266 --> 30:38.102
was caused by some strange life form.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.309
I was so worried.

30:40.480 --> 30:43.398
Your husband acting strange.

30:44.360 --> 30:45.771
Crewmen dying.

30:45.945 --> 30:49.361
You're so tired, darling. Just rest now.

30:50.366 --> 30:51.777
Medical Department alert.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.525
Doctors and medics, acknowledge.

30:54.829 --> 30:57.071
It's nothing, dear. It's nothing.

30:57.249 --> 30:59.538
You just sleep.

31:00.335 --> 31:03.787
Nancy will take care of everything.

31:11.973 --> 31:13.883
Dr. McCoy to the bridge.

31:14.059 --> 31:16.301
Dr. McCoy to the bridge.

31:42.006 --> 31:44.378
Dr. McCoy to the bridge.

32:03.571 --> 32:06.359
Captain's log, additional.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.075
Armed and able-bodied crewmen

32:08.243 --> 32:10.615
are not attacked and
slaughtered this easily.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.736
Apparently, the killer can
immobilize them as it approaches,

32:13.916 --> 32:17.332
perhaps with some hypnotic
or paralyzing power.

32:17.503 --> 32:20.421
The answer lies with Professor Crater.

32:24.135 --> 32:25.167
Professor Crater?

32:25.345 --> 32:29.213
- Go away, we don't want you here.
- We?

32:29.516 --> 32:32.186
Where's your wife, professor?
We're concerned about her.

32:32.353 --> 32:34.808
I'm armed. Go away.

32:40.445 --> 32:42.272
Where's your wife, professor?

32:42.447 --> 32:44.570
She's no concern of yours.

32:44.741 --> 32:48.822
We're worried about
her safety. Aren't you?

32:49.330 --> 32:52.081
Professor, you're a
reasonable man. Let me...

32:54.836 --> 32:56.460
- Kirk here.
- Casualty, captain.

32:56.629 --> 32:59.583
Barnhart was found dead
on Deck 9. Same symptoms.

33:07.349 --> 33:08.974
Spock cutting in,
captain. Something here,

33:09.143 --> 33:11.432
through the arches to your left.

33:12.271 --> 33:15.438
Stand by, Mr. Sulu. Spock has something.

33:22.616 --> 33:23.695
Green.

33:23.867 --> 33:26.822
- He beamed up to the ship with us.
- Or something did.

33:38.300 --> 33:39.877
Enterprise, from Kirk.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.166
Bridge, Sulu.

33:41.345 --> 33:42.424
You have an intruder aboard.

33:42.596 --> 33:44.423
Could be masquerading as Crewman Green.

33:44.598 --> 33:47.268
General Quarters, Security Condition 3.

33:47.435 --> 33:49.973
G. Q., Security 3, sir.

33:50.813 --> 33:53.387
General Quarters 3. Intruder alert.

33:53.566 --> 33:56.686
G. Q. 3. Intruder alert.

34:00.824 --> 34:03.660
General Quarters 3, intruder alert.

34:03.828 --> 34:06.698
G. Q. 3, intruder alert.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.206
Reporting G. Q. 3 secure, captain.

34:11.377 --> 34:12.753
Do you require assistance there?

34:12.920 --> 34:15.329
Crater knows the creature.
If we can take him alive...

34:15.507 --> 34:16.705
Negative, lieutenant.

34:16.882 --> 34:18.507
But keep locked in on us.

34:18.677 --> 34:20.918
Kirk out. Let's get him.

34:29.563 --> 34:31.723
We don't want you here.

34:31.900 --> 34:34.141
We're happy alone.

34:34.319 --> 34:36.692
I'll kill to stay alone.

34:36.864 --> 34:38.358
You hear that, Kirk?

34:38.532 --> 34:42.114
Or you'll have to kill me.
I don't care either way.

34:43.286 --> 34:46.870
Obviously, taking him alive
is going to be difficult.

34:47.250 --> 34:50.204
Set your phaser on one-quarter.
I'll leave mine on stun.

34:50.378 --> 34:52.335
Why risk your life for his?

34:52.505 --> 34:55.377
He's not trying to kill us,
he's trying to frighten us.

34:55.717 --> 34:57.876
And he's doing a pretty good job.

35:15.990 --> 35:18.742
G.Q. 3 now secured, except
for Decks 5, 7 and 10.

35:18.910 --> 35:20.238
Come in, please.

35:20.536 --> 35:22.328
He's not in Supply
and Maintenance, Sulu.

35:22.497 --> 35:24.039
All right, Uhura. Engineering Deck now.

35:24.207 --> 35:25.867
Run through file photos
of the crewmen there.

35:26.334 --> 35:28.161
- Check.
- Deck 5 reporting.

35:28.337 --> 35:31.088
Crewman Green is not in his
quarters. No one has seen him.

35:31.256 --> 35:33.545
Keep in mind if you find
him, he's not Crewman Green.

35:33.717 --> 35:35.046
Captain reports Green's dead.

35:35.261 --> 35:37.966
And he... Or rather, it followed me.

35:38.139 --> 35:40.262
I thought there was
something twitchy about him.

35:40.433 --> 35:43.600
He, or whatever, was probably
your crewman too, lieutenant.

35:43.770 --> 35:45.264
He must have been it.

35:45.439 --> 35:47.764
You know, I would have
remembered a crewman like him.

35:47.941 --> 35:50.693
The creature leading you
a merry chase, Mr. Sulu?

35:52.112 --> 35:53.192
Creature?

35:53.364 --> 35:55.440
Or whatever it is that's
killing the crewmen.

35:58.036 --> 35:59.945
Perhaps I can help.

36:00.455 --> 36:02.115
Fill me in.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.493
- Set.
- Acknowledged.

36:48.633 --> 36:50.175
Crater.

37:00.687 --> 37:02.431
Your wife, professor, where is she?

37:07.653 --> 37:09.313
Your wife, professor, where is she?

37:11.366 --> 37:12.741
She...

37:13.493 --> 37:15.367
...was the last of her kind.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.999
The last of her kind?

37:25.673 --> 37:27.630
The last of its kind.

37:32.389 --> 37:34.761
Earth history, remember?

37:34.933 --> 37:39.394
Like the passenger
pigeon or the buffalo.

37:40.981 --> 37:43.437
I feel strange.

37:43.734 --> 37:46.652
You're just stunned. You'll
be able to think in a minute.

37:48.406 --> 37:50.565
The Earth buffalo, what about it?

37:52.703 --> 37:56.321
Once there were millions of
them. Prairies black with them.

37:56.498 --> 37:59.583
One herd covered three whole states,

37:59.752 --> 38:02.160
and when they moved,
they were like thunder.

38:02.547 --> 38:04.705
And now they're gone.
Is that what you mean?

38:07.260 --> 38:08.838
Like the creatures here.

38:09.638 --> 38:12.888
Once there were millions of them.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.015
Now there's one left.

38:15.561 --> 38:16.841
Nancy understood.

38:19.357 --> 38:20.732
Always in the past tense.

38:24.821 --> 38:27.146
Where's your wife? Where is she now?

38:27.324 --> 38:30.907
Dead. Buried up on the
hill. It killed her.

38:31.078 --> 38:34.696
- When?
- Oh, a year...

38:35.291 --> 38:36.619
Or was it two?

38:40.797 --> 38:42.457
Kirk to Enterprise.

38:42.632 --> 38:44.424
Bridge to captain. Sulu here.

38:44.593 --> 38:47.131
It's definite, Mr. Sulu. The
intruder can assume any shape,

38:47.304 --> 38:48.929
a crewman, you, myself,
anyone. Understand?

38:49.097 --> 38:50.129
Affirmative, captain.

38:50.307 --> 38:51.338
Go to G.Q. 4.

38:51.517 --> 38:52.797
General Quarters 4, captain.

38:53.477 --> 38:57.392
The creature was trying to survive.
It has that right, doesn't it?

38:58.316 --> 39:00.273
Kirk to Transporter
Room, three to beam up.

39:00.443 --> 39:04.488
They needed salt to stay
alive. There was no more salt.

39:04.656 --> 39:07.444
It's the last one.

39:07.618 --> 39:09.907
The buffalo. There is no difference.

39:10.079 --> 39:12.831
There's one, professor. Your
creature is killing my people.

39:26.347 --> 39:28.174
Captain's log, continuing.

39:28.349 --> 39:30.388
The Enterprise has been
invaded by a creature

39:30.559 --> 39:35.186
capable of assuming any form
and with the capacity to paralyze

39:35.356 --> 39:37.100
and draw the life from any one of us.

39:37.275 --> 39:38.438
Deck 5, Section 3,

39:38.610 --> 39:40.519
Deck 5, Section 3, report.

39:40.696 --> 39:43.863
Security 3-A
here, 3-B in sight.

39:47.661 --> 39:50.912
Negative, captain. I've checked
every face on this vessel.

39:51.082 --> 39:52.280
It was not a crewman I saw.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.866
Yeoman Rand, how long
was this Green with you?

39:55.045 --> 39:56.243
As long as he...

39:56.421 --> 39:58.710
It thought it could get to
the salt on my tray, sir.

39:58.882 --> 39:59.913
Mr. Spock?

40:00.092 --> 40:02.001
Supplies of salt have
been set out as bait

40:02.177 --> 40:04.300
at all decks and
engineering levels, captain.

40:04.471 --> 40:07.045
However, no one or nothing
has approached them as yet.

40:08.351 --> 40:09.893
Dr. McCoy?

40:10.186 --> 40:11.217
Yes?

40:11.646 --> 40:13.188
The Medical Department report, doctor.

40:15.901 --> 40:19.733
Well, we could offer
it salt without tricks.

40:20.364 --> 40:22.024
There's no reason for it to attack us.

40:22.199 --> 40:25.070
Your attitude is laudable, doctor,
but your reasoning is reckless.

40:25.244 --> 40:28.115
The creature is not dangerous when fed.

40:28.581 --> 40:31.251
No, it's simply trying to survive

40:31.418 --> 40:34.751
by using its natural
ability to take other forms.

40:34.921 --> 40:36.120
The way the chameleon uses

40:36.298 --> 40:39.335
its protective colouring. An
ability retained, no doubt,

40:39.510 --> 40:41.052
from its primitive state,

40:41.220 --> 40:44.755
the way we have retained our
incisor teeth. They were once fangs.

40:45.099 --> 40:47.425
Certain of our muscles
were designed for chase.

40:47.602 --> 40:51.814
It uses its ability the way we would
use our muscles and teeth if necessary

40:51.982 --> 40:53.096
to stay alive.

40:53.275 --> 40:57.107
And like us, it's an intelligent animal.

40:57.279 --> 41:00.115
It's... There's no need to hunt it down.

41:00.449 --> 41:03.569
A very interesting hypothesis, doctor.

41:05.705 --> 41:07.947
- Briefing Room.
- All the halls sealed off.

41:08.124 --> 41:10.201
All weapons accounted
for and locked away.

41:10.377 --> 41:12.998
Security 4 in effect on every level.

41:13.172 --> 41:14.417
Still no lead on the intruder.

41:14.590 --> 41:17.959
Thank you, lieutenant.
Continue the search.

41:18.552 --> 41:20.629
Crater, we don't know who
or what we're looking for.

41:20.805 --> 41:22.430
We need your help, and now.

41:22.598 --> 41:25.553
I demanded, I even begged
that you get off my planet.

41:25.727 --> 41:27.470
Can you recognise this
thing when you see it?

41:33.152 --> 41:34.812
Professor...

41:35.321 --> 41:37.646
...l'll forego charges up to this point,

41:38.115 --> 41:40.903
but this creature is aboard
my ship, and I'll have it,

41:41.077 --> 41:43.319
or I'll have your skin
or both. Now, where is it?

41:54.091 --> 41:56.927
I loved Nancy very much.

41:57.261 --> 41:59.468
Few women like my Nancy.

41:59.639 --> 42:01.513
She lives in my dreams.

42:01.683 --> 42:04.008
She walks and sings in my dreams.

42:04.352 --> 42:07.104
And it becomes Nancy for you.

42:07.898 --> 42:11.766
Not because of tricks. It
doesn't trick me. It needs love

42:11.944 --> 42:13.901
as much as it needs salt.

42:14.071 --> 42:17.856
When it killed Nancy, I
almost destroyed it, but...

42:19.035 --> 42:20.862
...it isn't just a beast.

42:21.037 --> 42:25.201
It is intelligent and
the last of its kind.

42:25.375 --> 42:27.202
You bleed too much, Crater.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.038
You're too pure and noble.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.591
Are you saving the last of its kind,

42:32.758 --> 42:34.716
or has this become
Crater's private heaven,

42:34.886 --> 42:36.879
here on this planet?

42:37.222 --> 42:41.220
This thing becomes wife,
lover, best friend, wise man,

42:41.393 --> 42:44.145
fool, idol, slave.

42:45.356 --> 42:46.766
It isn't a bad life

42:47.066 --> 42:49.142
to have everyone in the
universe at your beck and call,

42:49.318 --> 42:50.729
and you win all the arguments.

42:51.404 --> 42:52.863
You don't understand.

42:53.031 --> 42:56.400
Have you learned to see this
thing in whatever form it becomes?

42:57.452 --> 42:59.943
- Yes.
- Are you gonna help us find it?

43:05.878 --> 43:07.123
Sorry, I can't.

43:09.340 --> 43:11.914
Recommend we use truth serum, captain.

43:12.927 --> 43:14.386
Doctor?

43:18.016 --> 43:21.801
Well, I resist using
it, but in this case,

43:21.979 --> 43:23.853
the professor will give us the truth.

43:24.899 --> 43:26.441
Take him.

43:34.075 --> 43:35.819
I'll accompany you, doctor.

43:35.994 --> 43:38.201
Oh, yes, of course.

43:52.846 --> 43:54.221
Captain Kirk to Dispensary.

43:54.389 --> 43:56.596
Captain Kirk to Dispensary. Urgent.

44:03.775 --> 44:05.399
It wasn't McCoy.

44:05.568 --> 44:07.063
It was the creature. It hit me.

44:08.154 --> 44:10.906
Crater grabbed my phaser.

44:11.074 --> 44:15.155
I wondered about McCoy. A
doubt had crossed my mind.

44:16.497 --> 44:18.288
Captain.

44:21.085 --> 44:24.668
- Professor Crater.
- Dead.

44:27.092 --> 44:28.337
But it had you too.

44:28.510 --> 44:32.508
Fortunately, my ancestors spawned
in another ocean than yours did.

44:32.681 --> 44:34.473
My blood salts are quite different.

44:45.570 --> 44:47.113
Leonard. Leonard, wake up, please!

44:47.280 --> 44:49.487
Help me. Help me, Leonard.

44:49.658 --> 44:51.734
They're trying to kill
me. Don't let them kill me!

44:51.910 --> 44:53.535
Who? Easy, easy, nobody's
going to hurt you.

44:53.704 --> 44:55.863
But you must help me!

45:02.839 --> 45:04.547
Move aside, Bones.

45:04.716 --> 45:07.753
- What's going on here, Jim?
- She's not Nancy, Bones.

45:13.893 --> 45:15.221
Are you insane?

45:15.394 --> 45:17.553
It killed four crewmen, now Crater.

45:18.565 --> 45:21.352
- It?
- The creature. It kills.

45:22.235 --> 45:23.516
It needs salt to live.

45:23.695 --> 45:25.237
- Bones, move aside.
- No!

45:27.533 --> 45:29.442
My guess is she needs more.

45:29.618 --> 45:30.899
You want it, Nancy?

45:39.838 --> 45:40.917
Come and get it.

45:41.548 --> 45:42.877
You're frightening her, Jim.

45:43.133 --> 45:47.048
Not fright. Hunger. Look at her.

45:47.221 --> 45:50.222
Leonard, if you love
me, make him go away.

45:50.892 --> 45:52.801
Come on. Do you want this, Nancy?

45:52.977 --> 45:54.769
Come on, Nancy. Come
and get it. Here it is.

45:54.938 --> 45:56.646
- Help me.
- I can't fire. Out of the way.

45:56.815 --> 45:58.309
- Stop it, Jim!
- McCoy, out of the way!

45:58.483 --> 46:00.606
What's the matter with you?
Are you out of your mind?

46:00.777 --> 46:02.188
Get out of the way.

46:21.216 --> 46:22.461
It's killing the captain.

46:22.635 --> 46:24.960
- Shoot it, doctor, quickly.
- No.

46:25.137 --> 46:26.632
No!

46:27.598 --> 46:29.805
It's killing the captain. Shoot, quick!

46:29.976 --> 46:31.351
I won't shoot Nancy.

46:31.770 --> 46:32.932
This is not Nancy.

46:33.104 --> 46:35.477
If she were Nancy, could she take this?

46:35.774 --> 46:38.016
Stop it! Stop it, Spock!

46:38.694 --> 46:40.153
Stop it!

46:46.953 --> 46:48.495
Is that Nancy, doctor?

46:49.330 --> 46:50.873
No.

46:58.007 --> 46:59.631
No.

47:37.174 --> 47:39.712
Leonard. Leonard, no.

47:45.475 --> 47:47.551
Leonard, please.

47:48.103 --> 47:50.179
Lord, forgive me.

48:16.676 --> 48:18.503
I'm sorry, Bones.

48:34.862 --> 48:37.354
Ready to leave orbit, captain.

48:42.829 --> 48:44.110
Is something wrong, captain?

48:49.462 --> 48:51.454
I was thinking about
the buffalo, Mr. Spock.

49:03.310 --> 49:04.639
Warp 1, Mr. Sulu.

49:04.812 --> 49:07.481
Warp 1, sir. Leaving orbit.

49:08.305 --> 49:14.552
