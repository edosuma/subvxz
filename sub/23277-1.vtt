00:39.703 --> 00:42.457
<i>There is no sign of the National Guard.</i>

00:42.537 --> 00:44.780
<i>Creatures are tearing up the city.</i>

00:47.702 --> 00:49.947
<i>Many people eaten alive!</i>

00:50.938 --> 00:52.880
<i>They're coming!</i>

00:54.636 --> 00:56.446
Let's get out of here!

01:23.903 --> 01:26.413
Open the door! Open the door!

01:42.286 --> 01:45.056
Mom? I know. Here, too.

01:45.136 --> 01:48.857
Mom, listen to me, you need to get up
and lock the door to your room, okay?

01:48.937 --> 01:51.090
Don't let anyone in. Not the nurses...

01:51.170 --> 01:53.250
Mom? Mom!

02:22.536 --> 02:25.758
So now we've had time to see
what death looks like.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.524
The question for all of you is...

02:29.103 --> 02:30.947
...how did he die?

02:32.970 --> 02:37.023
Now remember, the patient
first complained of a sore throat...

02:37.103 --> 02:40.224
...a fever and a cough.

02:41.003 --> 02:45.802
Considering these factors,
can you find this man's cause of death?

02:55.236 --> 02:59.491
So, any of you got a theory on C.O.D.
based off this information?

03:00.370 --> 03:01.979
Syphilis?

03:03.736 --> 03:07.124
Nice try, Abby, but I don't think
syphilis infects the lungs.

03:08.329 --> 03:09.714
Peter.

03:11.202 --> 03:12.783
Suzie?

03:21.369 --> 03:22.924
Influenza.

03:23.503 --> 03:27.456
Correct. Now, what strain is it, Zoe?

03:27.536 --> 03:30.143
It has to be H1N5.

03:30.223 --> 03:32.323
Close. H1N1.

03:32.403 --> 03:34.143
Note the collapsed air sacs.

03:34.223 --> 03:37.891
They couldn't inflate,
so they couldn't provide oxygen.

03:37.970 --> 03:39.847
That's what killed him.

03:40.870 --> 03:44.380
Oh, don't worry, Zoe.
You're not being graded today.

03:54.736 --> 03:56.377
Hey, doc.

03:56.457 --> 03:59.357
Any chance you wanna come
to the end of the semester's fiesta?

03:59.437 --> 04:02.090
What, and go drinking with my students?

04:02.170 --> 04:04.824
Think I'll pass. Have fun.

04:05.403 --> 04:07.956
- You're coming, right?
- No, you go ahead.

04:08.036 --> 04:09.677
I have some tests to finish up first.

04:09.757 --> 04:13.624
Hey, don't beat yourself up. I know
you can be obsessed about these things.

04:13.704 --> 04:17.766
I know. I just...
can't believe I didn't see it.

04:19.070 --> 04:21.313
- Okay, call me.
- I will.

04:44.169 --> 04:46.690
Sorry to bother you, Zoe.

04:46.770 --> 04:50.350
Your regular just came in
to give his weekly blood sample.

04:50.430 --> 04:52.724
Can Abby help? He makes me uncomfortable.

04:52.804 --> 04:56.057
I know he's a bit strange,
but the antibodies in his blood...

04:56.137 --> 04:58.467
...are a hundred times normal level.

04:58.547 --> 05:01.190
It's unlike anything we've ever seen before.

05:01.270 --> 05:04.879
Trust me, Zoe, this is a great
opportunity for you.

05:26.236 --> 05:29.313
- Hi, Zoe.
- Hi, Max.

05:29.869 --> 05:33.146
- It's good to see you again.
- Your arm.

05:35.352 --> 05:38.429
- Anything for you.
- Please roll up your sleeve.

05:40.536 --> 05:42.346
Of course.

05:51.929 --> 05:53.524
So...

05:54.053 --> 05:57.741
...have you thought about
what I asked last time?

05:58.170 --> 06:00.980
I told you, not interested, Max.

06:04.436 --> 06:06.912
You know, I'm never gonna give up.

06:07.336 --> 06:09.413
You really should give me a chance.

06:11.690 --> 06:13.513
Make a fist.

06:17.269 --> 06:18.853
Relax.

06:22.569 --> 06:24.380
Like a vampire.

06:26.035 --> 06:27.846
Sucking me dry.

06:35.502 --> 06:38.380
Zoe, thank you for being so gentle.

06:39.236 --> 06:41.162
Your other arm.

06:56.553 --> 06:59.110
- What is that?
- You like it?

07:01.469 --> 07:04.657
- This has to stop!
- Is there a problem in here, Zoe?

07:04.736 --> 07:08.217
No. I'm just giving my weekly sample.

07:08.297 --> 07:11.379
Get out of here, you creepy old fuck!

07:15.969 --> 07:17.513
Zoe.

07:18.835 --> 07:21.691
This guy is crazy. He won't leave me alone.

07:21.770 --> 07:25.613
You can't let people do that to you, Zoe.
Be stronger next time.

07:27.402 --> 07:29.647
Come on. The party's waiting.

07:35.636 --> 07:37.053
Chug! Chug! Chug!

07:37.133 --> 07:38.647
Yeah!

07:46.669 --> 07:49.657
Doctor's orders. Mingle. Drink.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.123
You know me, social gatherings.

07:52.203 --> 07:54.490
We see these people every day, Zoe.

07:54.570 --> 07:56.624
Hey, babe, where you been?

07:56.703 --> 07:59.323
Trying to get the shy one out of her shell.

07:59.403 --> 08:01.956
- Let's grab a beer.
- We tapped the first keg already.

08:02.036 --> 08:04.823
But we got two more chilling in the morgue.
Can one of you help me?

08:04.903 --> 08:08.745
I got it. I'll socialize after, I swear.

08:20.753 --> 08:22.329
Peter?

08:30.635 --> 08:32.480
Peter, where are you?

08:39.337 --> 08:41.549
- You're an asshole!
- Come on.

08:41.629 --> 08:44.023
You know every one of us
has wanted to do that.

08:44.102 --> 08:46.567
No, just idiots like you.

08:47.603 --> 08:50.773
Sorry. I'm a dick, I know this.

08:50.853 --> 08:53.460
Now, can we please go get drunk?

08:54.403 --> 08:56.812
Just don't ever do that to me again.

09:19.229 --> 09:20.679
Max.

09:21.369 --> 09:23.246
What are you doing down here?

09:25.169 --> 09:27.046
Relax, Zoe.

09:28.119 --> 09:29.857
I just wanna talk.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.610
There's nothing for us to talk about.

09:32.690 --> 09:36.152
See... we are connected.

09:36.803 --> 09:40.279
- There is no "we," Max.
- We're meant...

09:40.969 --> 09:43.456
- ...to be together!
- Let go of me!

09:43.536 --> 09:44.842
Peter!

09:46.236 --> 09:49.589
- Give me a chance.
- No! No! Get off me!

09:49.669 --> 09:51.555
Help me!

09:57.336 --> 09:59.850
Somebody help me!

09:59.930 --> 10:02.090
I like it when you fight.

10:02.170 --> 10:05.013
You are mine.

10:22.370 --> 10:25.446
Zoe! Zoe!

10:29.602 --> 10:31.556
Zoe!

10:31.636 --> 10:34.566
Zoe! Help!

10:37.286 --> 10:39.323
Everybody, we have to get
the fuck out of here!

10:39.403 --> 10:41.023
- What?
- Now! He's awake!

10:41.103 --> 10:42.556
Zoe, what's going on?

10:42.636 --> 10:46.431
Please move! Why the hell
aren't you moving? Come on!

10:46.510 --> 10:48.545
Dr. Beeman, are you okay?

10:52.982 --> 10:55.674
- Peter, no! Get away from her!
- Peter!

11:04.136 --> 11:06.212
Abby, come on! Come on!

11:21.337 --> 11:24.222
Zoe! Come on, help me up there!

11:24.302 --> 11:26.779
- Help!
- Abby, no!

11:29.802 --> 11:32.186
Abby! Abby!

11:34.700 --> 11:36.246
Abby!

11:54.069 --> 11:57.090
<i>It's been five years
since the first outbreak.</i>

11:57.170 --> 11:59.522
<i>When reports came out
from around the world...</i>

11:59.602 --> 12:04.456
<i>...about the virus becoming an international
emergency, it was too late.</i>

12:04.536 --> 12:06.656
<i>Few of us survived.</i>

12:06.736 --> 12:09.546
<i>The rest became rotters.</i>

12:12.702 --> 12:17.090
<i>I was one of the lucky ones to have made it
to one of the refugee camps in time...</i>

12:17.170 --> 12:20.057
<i>...only to be assigned to High Rock Bunker...</i>

12:20.736 --> 12:23.323
<i>...an intelligence
and recon military station...</i>

12:23.402 --> 12:26.412
<i>...to gather data of rotters for CDC.</i>

12:27.469 --> 12:29.290
<i>Problem is...</i>

12:29.370 --> 12:32.246
<i>...it's been a year
since we've heard from HQ.</i>

12:34.303 --> 12:36.223
<i>And probably forever...</i>

12:36.303 --> 12:38.346
<i>...since we saw a survivor.</i>

12:40.769 --> 12:42.690
<i>So this is our home now...</i>

12:42.770 --> 12:46.456
<i>...part military base, part refugee camp.</i>

12:47.036 --> 12:51.124
<i>You make do with what you have,
scavenge what's left of life.</i>

12:51.703 --> 12:53.522
<i>After all...</i>

12:53.602 --> 12:56.293
<i>...this is going to be our home
for a little while.</i>

12:58.470 --> 13:01.358
<i>...please report to station four right now.</i>

13:03.136 --> 13:07.190
- Morning, Shannon. How are your headaches?
- Much better. Thank you, Zoe.

13:07.270 --> 13:10.456
You little devil,
better let your mom sleep tonight.

13:11.735 --> 13:14.856
<i>Curfew announcement.
Today's lockdown will occur at 1600...</i>

13:14.936 --> 13:18.157
- Obeying the speed limit, Jeremy?
- Never.

13:18.237 --> 13:21.123
Hey, doc, you gonna hit the shower
after your morning jog?

13:21.203 --> 13:23.923
- Let me know if you need a hand.
- Easy up, Alphonse. She's taken.

13:24.003 --> 13:25.622
She knows I'm only joking, Lucy.

13:25.702 --> 13:28.190
I'm just keeping myself fresh
till the right girl comes along.

13:28.270 --> 13:32.690
- You might be waiting a while.
- That's cold, doc. Real cold.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.612
Come on, Alphonse.

13:36.368 --> 13:40.690
Do you think the lieutenant is right
and we're just wasting our time here?

13:40.770 --> 13:43.456
Maybe God doesn't want us
to reverse what happened.

13:43.536 --> 13:47.423
Doesn't matter that Miguel thinks.
We have a job to do.

13:48.303 --> 13:50.179
Got your back.

13:58.368 --> 14:00.789
Elyse, can you pass me
rotter sample number eight?

14:00.869 --> 14:02.678
Sure thing.

14:07.069 --> 14:08.859
Here you go.

14:10.236 --> 14:12.091
I remember this one.

14:12.770 --> 14:16.177
Guy had a nasty set
of bite marks on his hands.

14:16.257 --> 14:18.323
What do you think happened to him?

14:18.723 --> 14:21.612
I'd say he had his hands
down the wrong girl's pants.

14:25.301 --> 14:26.812
Zoe?

14:27.635 --> 14:29.563
Lily's fever shot up.

14:29.643 --> 14:31.923
The medicine you gave her didn't work.

14:32.402 --> 14:34.246
Meet me in the med ward.

14:46.435 --> 14:48.589
Where does it hurt, sweetie?

14:48.669 --> 14:50.191
Everywhere.

14:50.970 --> 14:53.706
You're such a brave little girl.

14:54.335 --> 14:56.456
Just close your eyes and rest.

14:56.536 --> 14:58.979
I'll try and make you feel better, okay?

15:05.468 --> 15:09.136
As long as Jeff can promise a heavy crop,
we'll make it through winter.

15:09.216 --> 15:11.923
I'll see what I can do.
Let's just hope mother nature cooperates.

15:12.003 --> 15:13.596
Any other pressing issues?

15:13.676 --> 15:17.822
Yeah, we found more rats in the warehouse,
but Steve's taking care of it.

15:17.902 --> 15:20.512
I've noticed a lot of sloppiness as of late.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.623
We're at war, people. One error can
ruin all the work we've done here.

15:24.703 --> 15:28.057
I won't tolerate any mistakes.
Zoe, you're late.

15:28.137 --> 15:30.612
I'm sorry for interrupting, but it's serious.

15:33.068 --> 15:35.675
- What is it?
- The antibiotics I used on Lily aren't working.

15:35.755 --> 15:39.090
She's worse.
I believe it's bacterial pneumonia...

15:39.170 --> 15:42.489
...which is highly contagious.
I've quarantined her for now, but still...

15:42.569 --> 15:44.590
You're the town doctor. You're
telling me there's nothing you can do.

15:44.670 --> 15:48.389
I don't have the antibiotics
to properly treat what Lily has.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.956
We need to go on a supply run.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.970
We've already ransacked every place
within the designated range...

15:53.050 --> 15:54.656
...for your bullshit rotter research.

15:54.736 --> 15:58.523
Then we need to go past our
usual search distance. Be bolder.

15:58.603 --> 16:01.623
I was a med student
at Whittendale University.

16:02.103 --> 16:05.523
The medical supply cache
was secured inside a locked vault.

16:06.402 --> 16:09.623
- I know the code.
- No. It's too far.

16:09.703 --> 16:12.763
I know it's far, but it is worth the risk.

16:12.843 --> 16:16.456
We would have enough medication to save Lily
and to stop her illness from spreading.

16:16.536 --> 16:18.265
Or we keep Lily isolated.

16:20.035 --> 16:22.473
Keeping her isolated will not help.

16:23.003 --> 16:25.589
Her sickness will spread inside this bunker.

16:25.669 --> 16:27.489
Many of us will die.

16:28.168 --> 16:30.445
It is a medical certainty.

16:36.168 --> 16:40.643
Okay. My brother Baca,
is gonna lead your little field trip.

16:40.723 --> 16:43.880
You leave tomorrow at dawn, and you
come right back. No sightseeing...

16:43.960 --> 16:46.689
...no side tracks. Are we absolutely clear?

16:46.769 --> 16:48.578
Yes, sir.

17:08.367 --> 17:10.178
It's gonna be okay.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.179
I missed you.

17:52.401 --> 17:56.222
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>You are mine.</i>

17:56.302 --> 17:58.545
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

18:01.769 --> 18:03.590
What's wrong?

18:03.970 --> 18:05.545
Nothing.

18:07.335 --> 18:09.178
What does that mean?

18:10.251 --> 18:12.095
I have to go out.

18:13.568 --> 18:16.322
Really? We talked about this last time.

18:16.402 --> 18:18.676
I just... I have a lot on my mind.

18:18.756 --> 18:20.579
What, and us?

18:21.869 --> 18:24.623
That's not important? I love you, Zoe.

18:24.703 --> 18:27.357
Look, I care about you.

18:28.236 --> 18:30.189
I do, but...

18:30.269 --> 18:32.746
...I need to go and check on Lily right now.

19:02.719 --> 19:04.656
Hey, Zoe.

19:04.736 --> 19:06.612
Hey, sweetie.

19:08.235 --> 19:12.289
Tomorrow morning, I'm going outside to
try and find something to make you better.

19:12.869 --> 19:15.823
But there are rotters out there.

19:15.903 --> 19:17.790
No, it's okay.

19:18.569 --> 19:20.445
They don't scare me.

19:20.935 --> 19:22.757
Do me a favor.

19:23.836 --> 19:26.176
Will you hold on to this
for me while I'm gone?

19:26.256 --> 19:28.112
It was my mom's.

19:30.451 --> 19:33.106
It used to protect me
when I was a little girl.

19:33.936 --> 19:35.823
Now, it'll do the same for you.

19:36.802 --> 19:38.322
Thank you.

19:38.602 --> 19:40.445
Good night, sweetie.

19:41.869 --> 19:43.712
Good night.

19:58.836 --> 20:00.756
<i>Attention all civilians.</i>

20:00.836 --> 20:04.489
<i>Main team ready to leave
in t-minus three minutes.</i>

20:04.569 --> 20:07.356
- <i>Protocol...</i>
- I'll be back before you know it.

20:07.436 --> 20:11.111
<i>All civilians are to clear
perimeter in their zones.</i>

20:14.135 --> 20:17.546
<i>I repeat, clear perimeter in all zones.</i>

20:20.635 --> 20:22.955
I'm sorry about last night. I didn't...

20:23.035 --> 20:25.280
No, I shouldn't have reacted that way.

20:28.669 --> 20:30.429
Let's go get Lily her meds.

21:14.552 --> 21:16.172
<i>Team Two, how's your status?</i>

21:16.252 --> 21:19.129
<i>East side perimeter clear. Nothing here.</i>

21:22.068 --> 21:23.878
I used to do this as a kid.

21:27.101 --> 21:28.612
What?

21:29.369 --> 21:32.178
You just never talked
about your childhood before.

21:34.701 --> 21:37.757
Your mom? Your dad?

21:38.236 --> 21:40.112
There isn't much to talk about.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.144
How about you?

21:44.601 --> 21:46.457
My dad was an army man.

21:47.236 --> 21:49.111
Never smiled.

21:50.235 --> 21:52.657
Except when he took Miguel and I hunting.

21:53.736 --> 21:55.790
Hard to believe you two are brothers.

21:56.369 --> 22:00.045
- You're so different.
- Miguel's always been the way he is.

22:01.201 --> 22:02.855
Always...

22:02.935 --> 22:04.989
...wanted to be the superior one.

22:05.968 --> 22:07.978
Always wanted to control things.

22:09.901 --> 22:11.779
Like my dad.

22:18.635 --> 22:23.142
You know what I miss, man?
A nice, greasy cheeseburger with fries.

22:23.222 --> 22:26.470
I'd have to go with Deep Dish
Pizza, Chicago style.

22:26.550 --> 22:29.389
Solid. What about you, Elyse?

22:30.068 --> 22:33.145
I miss Maggie's Place.

22:34.101 --> 22:37.189
It was a diner in Wichita
my mom used to take me to.

22:37.719 --> 22:39.849
Best damn apple pie you ever tasted.

22:39.929 --> 22:43.589
Nice. Frank, what do you miss, man?

22:43.669 --> 22:45.922
Ice cream sundaes? Chicken nuggets?

22:46.002 --> 22:48.212
I miss people shutting the fuck up.

22:59.386 --> 23:02.789
<i>Fuck! Something's wrong. Everybody pull over.</i>

23:03.069 --> 23:05.944
<i>All right, people. Look sharp. Stay focused.</i>

23:14.368 --> 23:16.245
Set up a perimeter!

23:17.201 --> 23:20.889
This is a bad spot. We won't see
any rotters until they're on us.

23:20.969 --> 23:22.979
It's not like we had any say
where we broke down.

23:23.059 --> 23:25.189
You guys wanna keep it down
and watch your six.

23:25.269 --> 23:27.111
Talk to me, Lucy.

23:29.188 --> 23:31.322
- Come on!
- Fucking radiator again.

23:31.402 --> 23:35.236
- Savin said it was good to go.
- All right. Well, how long to fix it?

23:35.536 --> 23:39.022
Not sure. The coolant isn't
getting to the engine block.

23:39.102 --> 23:40.722
The lieutenant's gonna be
pissed if we show up late!

23:40.802 --> 23:42.656
Yeah, I'm aware.

23:42.735 --> 23:45.553
All right, well, come on, Lucy.
We don't have much time until nightfall.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.389
I know.

23:47.469 --> 23:51.089
All right, you heard the man.
First team, secure west perimeter.

23:51.169 --> 23:52.892
Second team, take the east.

24:19.435 --> 24:21.290
This is taking too long.

24:21.973 --> 24:25.854
We should turn around.
We can come back in a few days.

24:26.928 --> 24:29.259
- Lily can't wait a few days.
- I'm sorry.

24:29.339 --> 24:32.249
I just don't see the math
in risking eight lives for one!

24:32.769 --> 24:36.055
- Sick kid or not.
- Let me put it this way.

24:36.135 --> 24:38.022
What if Lily was your kid?

24:38.402 --> 24:40.212
Your sick one in the bunker?

24:41.301 --> 24:43.978
Because if we don't succeed, it could be.

24:45.635 --> 24:47.111
Fuck!

24:48.001 --> 24:50.612
Rotters! Everybody in position!

24:51.768 --> 24:53.729
- Lucy!
- Almost there.

24:53.809 --> 24:55.578
Give me one more minute.

24:56.792 --> 25:01.012
- Sounds like a swarm!
- Lucy, come on, we gotta go! Hurry up!

25:01.868 --> 25:05.356
- Yes! I got it!
- Everyone back to the vehicles, now!

25:05.436 --> 25:08.091
Move, move, move, move!

25:08.901 --> 25:10.308
Go, go!

25:12.768 --> 25:15.549
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, come on, go!

25:15.628 --> 25:17.599
- Go!
- Now!

25:38.634 --> 25:41.539
<i>Team Two, give me a status report.</i>

25:41.618 --> 25:43.105
<i>All clear.</i>

25:43.185 --> 25:45.440
<i>Looks like we lost them. Over.</i>

25:45.819 --> 25:49.106
<i>Copy. Casualty report? Over.</i>

25:49.186 --> 25:53.456
<i>No casualties. Looks like
we dodged a big one. Over.</i>

25:53.536 --> 25:55.655
<i>And not a moment too soon.</i>

25:55.735 --> 25:57.578
<i>We're here, guys.</i>

26:09.501 --> 26:13.145
Lucy, Derek, Thomas, you stay here.
Everyone else on me.

26:18.001 --> 26:19.912
Alphonse, go!

26:26.034 --> 26:28.265
Right, then the first left.

26:34.101 --> 26:36.945
Straight ahead. Take a left at the end.

27:15.728 --> 27:17.245
Clear.

27:17.901 --> 27:19.778
Let's move.

27:36.468 --> 27:37.978
Go!

27:54.068 --> 27:56.232
Here. This one on the left.

28:09.868 --> 28:11.412
Clear.

28:13.569 --> 28:16.845
These are vaccines, these are
antibiotics. Grab those first.

28:30.134 --> 28:34.055
- Lucy, what's your sit-rep?
- <i>All clear out here. Over.</i>

28:34.135 --> 28:37.211
- Copy that. Stay put. We'll be out in five.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

28:40.168 --> 28:42.212
All right, we got it. Let's go.

28:43.550 --> 28:45.399
All right, people, we gotta move.

30:37.201 --> 30:38.622
- Where's Zoe?
- I don't know.

30:38.702 --> 30:41.259
- Shots came from the south wing.
- Go, go!

31:17.467 --> 31:20.469
Jesus, Zoe.
What the hell happened? Are you okay?

31:20.549 --> 31:23.778
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- We need to move now.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.932
Rotters are coming! Move!

31:28.012 --> 31:29.645
Go!

31:36.684 --> 31:38.564
I don't have a clear shot!

31:39.801 --> 31:41.522
God!

31:41.642 --> 31:43.705
Come on, Frank, let's go!

31:43.935 --> 31:46.759
- Dear God, he's infected!
- Go!

31:46.839 --> 31:48.659
Get out of here! Go!

31:52.001 --> 31:53.811
We gotta move.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.844
Go! Now! Move, move!

32:10.968 --> 32:12.844
Baca, where's Frank?

32:13.400 --> 32:15.278
He's gone! Get in!

32:16.834 --> 32:19.245
Let's go! Move, move, move!

33:02.001 --> 33:03.845
Go check the Humvees.

33:06.001 --> 33:08.099
You're way fucking late, Baca.

33:08.178 --> 33:10.845
We ran into some car trouble.

33:12.150 --> 33:15.889
And we lost Frank, too. He's dead.

33:15.969 --> 33:19.268
This is why we don't go on wild
fucking goose chase supply runs.

33:19.348 --> 33:21.522
- So people don't die for nothing.
- It wasn't for nothing!

33:21.602 --> 33:23.471
We got the meds, Miguel.

33:24.150 --> 33:27.175
It's "Lieutenant." And you should've aborted
the minute you had vehicle problems.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.544
We needed to get the supplies.

33:31.250 --> 33:32.961
Where's Frank?

33:34.134 --> 33:36.012
Why don't you tell her, Zoe?

33:41.934 --> 33:43.778
I'm so sorry, Elle.

33:46.101 --> 33:47.912
This is all on you!

33:49.034 --> 33:51.244
It was your idea to go out there!

34:37.467 --> 34:38.942
Hey, wait up!

34:39.022 --> 34:41.688
<i>All residents return to the bunker now.</i>

34:41.768 --> 34:44.645
<i>All residents return to the bunker now.</i>

34:49.333 --> 34:51.811
<i>All residents return to the bunker.</i>

34:52.802 --> 34:55.978
<i>All residents return to bunker now.</i>

35:05.367 --> 35:08.859
- You didn't hear the shift buzzer?
- I wanna look for my ball.

35:09.368 --> 35:11.411
I'll find it. You go inside.

35:26.668 --> 35:28.929
<i>Main gate now closing.</i>

35:34.901 --> 35:36.789
Sorry, thought I checked it.

35:37.468 --> 35:40.975
Sorry's not gonna cut it
when there's rotters up your ass.

36:15.034 --> 36:16.878
We got it.

36:19.834 --> 36:21.788
Hey, sweetie.

36:21.868 --> 36:23.388
You came back.

36:24.167 --> 36:26.244
A promise is a promise.

36:30.634 --> 36:34.650
This may taste a little gross,
but you're a brave one, right?

36:39.234 --> 36:41.111
Just a little more.

36:41.368 --> 36:42.778
Good girl.

36:49.734 --> 36:51.311
Zoe.

36:51.868 --> 36:53.678
Thank you.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.355
Thank you so much.

36:57.435 --> 36:59.244
You're welcome.

37:12.267 --> 37:13.844
Hey.

38:29.967 --> 38:31.588
This is High Rock emergency bunker.

38:31.668 --> 38:35.278
If anyone can hear this message,
please respond on this frequency.

38:38.001 --> 38:39.609
This is High Rock emergency bunker.

38:39.689 --> 38:43.144
If anyone can hear this message,
please respond on this frequency.

38:45.534 --> 38:49.211
This is High Rock emergency bunker.
If anyone can hear this message...

38:50.300 --> 38:52.177
You wanted to see me?

38:53.334 --> 38:55.210
Leave the room.

39:05.201 --> 39:09.887
I asked you here because I think you and I
have had somewhat of a misunderstanding.

39:09.967 --> 39:11.594
Misunderstanding?

39:17.534 --> 39:20.555
Don't you ever talk back to me
like that again in front of the others.

39:20.635 --> 39:24.883
I'm in charge here. My job is to keep the
people safe, and I decide how that's done.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.478
Understood?

39:27.900 --> 39:29.422
Yes...

39:29.702 --> 39:31.354
...Lieutenant.

39:31.434 --> 39:33.397
You're dismissed.

40:40.767 --> 40:42.642
Zoe, wait up.

40:43.301 --> 40:45.188
What did Miguel want?

40:45.568 --> 40:48.288
Why don't you ask him, Baca?
He's your brother.

40:48.368 --> 40:50.411
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:52.100 --> 40:55.021
Miguel shouldn't have blamed you
for Frank, all right?

40:55.101 --> 40:58.988
That's not on you. Frank knew
the risks we all take going outside.

40:59.068 --> 41:02.943
What's important is that you saved
Lily and everyone else here.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.478
We're all thankful for it.

41:06.700 --> 41:08.511
Thank you.

41:18.833 --> 41:20.877
I should get back to work.

41:31.067 --> 41:33.111
Fucking rats!

42:06.650 --> 42:08.854
<i>Please make sure ration cards are stamped...</i>

42:08.934 --> 42:11.221
I was at the game. I'm telling you...

42:11.301 --> 42:14.754
...your pitchers couldn't throw
a fastball to save their lives.

42:14.834 --> 42:17.954
You need a strong bullpen
to have a good baseball team.

42:18.034 --> 42:21.488
I don't care what you say.
The Yankees were the best ever, man.

42:21.568 --> 42:24.055
If it weren't for the rotters, hell,
we would've won the last season.

42:24.135 --> 42:27.641
Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
My Rangers would've swept your guys.

42:27.721 --> 42:31.255
- High Rock's finest.
- Compliments of the chef.

42:31.335 --> 42:35.429
<i>...are stamped by a station officer
before proceeding to line.</i>

42:35.509 --> 42:38.342
What the fuck is with this line, Jeff?
People got work details.

42:38.422 --> 42:40.754
Sorry, I got off
to a late start this morning.

42:40.834 --> 42:44.689
Steve was supposed to come in and fix the
broken stove, but he hasn't shown up yet.

42:45.688 --> 42:48.088
Wendy, go talk to your boyfriend.

42:48.168 --> 42:50.954
Tell him to come up here
and fix this stove immediately.

42:51.034 --> 42:52.843
Yes, sir.

42:56.566 --> 42:58.411
Move it faster.

43:02.501 --> 43:04.044
Stevie?

43:06.100 --> 43:07.977
Where are you, honey?

43:10.633 --> 43:12.677
You're needed in the mess hall.

43:15.167 --> 43:16.743
Sweetie?

43:18.150 --> 43:19.961
Miguel's pissed.

43:54.001 --> 43:56.724
Help! Help!

43:56.804 --> 43:59.261
Help! Help!

44:01.967 --> 44:04.587
Hey, Lily. Jeremy.

44:04.667 --> 44:07.088
- Hi, Zoe.
- It's past Lily's bedtime.

44:07.168 --> 44:09.010
She needs rest.

44:10.067 --> 44:12.077
You can come back tomorrow, okay?

44:13.267 --> 44:15.455
- Bye, Lily.
- Bye.

44:15.534 --> 44:18.577
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

44:21.532 --> 44:23.608
I wanted to give you this back.

44:23.688 --> 44:26.767
Oh, keep it. Looks better on you.

44:34.499 --> 44:35.925
Now go to sleep.

44:36.005 --> 44:38.688
Not before my mom comes to say good night.

44:39.667 --> 44:41.677
She'll be by after her work shift.

44:44.467 --> 44:46.604
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.111
Sweet dreams.

45:19.301 --> 45:23.681
<i>Code red. Intruder alert.
Code red. Intruder alert.</i>

45:23.761 --> 45:27.454
Alarm in the medical wing.
I repeat, alarm in the medical wing. Go!

45:27.934 --> 45:29.810
Go, go, go!

45:31.300 --> 45:32.811
Go!

45:37.566 --> 45:39.391
Come on! No, no, no!

46:04.667 --> 46:06.222
Max?

46:06.628 --> 46:09.477
You recognize me? How are you still alive?

46:19.334 --> 46:20.506
Zoe!

46:22.633 --> 46:25.587
- Don't kill him! He's not a rotter!
- Zoe, get out of the fucking way!

46:25.667 --> 46:29.348
- Trust me! We need to catch him alive!
- Bullshit! He's one of them!

46:29.427 --> 46:33.618
No! He's not! His name is Max!
He's a patient of mine!

46:33.698 --> 46:37.493
Baca, he's the breakthrough
I've been searching for!

46:49.067 --> 46:51.278
We got you now, motherfucker!

46:55.400 --> 46:58.588
What the hell? Are you all fucking crazy?

46:58.678 --> 47:02.098
- Why didn't you kill it?
- Wait. He's alive.

47:02.467 --> 47:04.710
I need him for my research.

47:05.034 --> 47:06.854
Looks like a rotter to me.

47:06.934 --> 47:08.551
Yes.

47:08.631 --> 47:11.055
But we all know that rotters always bite.

47:11.934 --> 47:14.543
He had the chance to bite me
before, and he didn't.

47:15.633 --> 47:17.443
Prove it.

47:21.833 --> 47:23.844
Zoe, you don't have to do that.

47:56.167 --> 47:57.609
See?

47:58.733 --> 48:01.020
It means his brain is still working.

48:01.100 --> 48:04.088
He got the bite, but something
in his body stopped him from turning.

48:04.367 --> 48:06.681
He could be the breakthrough we need
in beating the rotter virus.

48:06.761 --> 48:08.428
You can't cure being a rotter.

48:08.508 --> 48:10.814
I'm not talking about a cure
for being a rotter.

48:10.894 --> 48:13.421
I'm talking about a vaccine
for the rest of us.

48:13.591 --> 48:15.641
A bite would no longer be a death sentence.

48:17.533 --> 48:19.077
Please.

48:20.167 --> 48:23.852
- Just give me a chance.
- This is all a bunch of bullshit. Shoot it.

48:23.932 --> 48:27.488
Miguel, wait! If there's
a chance Zoe can do it.

48:27.768 --> 48:29.643
We should let her try.

48:30.733 --> 48:32.554
This vaccine...

48:32.634 --> 48:34.277
...could've saved Frank.

48:40.467 --> 48:42.488
Fine. Do your tests.

48:42.868 --> 48:44.854
I want it locked up at all times.

48:44.934 --> 48:46.776
If there are any issues...

48:47.283 --> 48:49.161
...put it the fuck down.

48:49.967 --> 48:51.810
Yes, sir.

48:55.134 --> 48:59.521
<i>Only 12 hours since Max has been restrained
and placed under observation...</i>

48:59.601 --> 49:02.880
<i>...and already High Rock Bunker
is divided up on their opinions...</i>

49:02.960 --> 49:05.453
<i>...on what we should do with him.</i>

49:05.533 --> 49:09.855
<i>Miguel is looking for any excuse
he can find to put him down.</i>

49:09.935 --> 49:13.421
<i>With our current specimens
of rotters' blood running low...</i>

49:13.501 --> 49:17.521
<i>...I need to acquire additional samples
to buy myself more time...</i>

49:17.601 --> 49:20.610
<i>...to find scientific proof Max is different.</i>

49:21.450 --> 49:23.277
<i>Max's vitals!</i>

49:28.100 --> 49:30.977
Look at this. It's incredible.

49:32.617 --> 49:35.371
Certain internal
and external parts are dead...

49:35.451 --> 49:38.304
...while other parts
are still very much alive.

49:38.834 --> 49:42.304
His heart, his eyes, legs,
and his cranial area...

49:42.384 --> 49:44.804
...all still retaining human function.

49:44.884 --> 49:47.760
- Any clue as to why?
- No, not yet.

49:51.149 --> 49:53.190
But I need to take his blood sample.

49:55.253 --> 49:59.693
We're breaking protocol here, Zoe.
He makes one wrong move, I'm shooting him.

50:01.550 --> 50:03.593
Just relax, Max.

50:06.216 --> 50:08.061
You want me, right?

50:10.416 --> 50:12.226
Here I am.

50:15.550 --> 50:17.360
Your Zoe.

50:18.450 --> 50:20.293
That's right.

50:22.100 --> 50:25.343
I know you came all this way just for me.

50:39.149 --> 50:40.994
You like feeling my touch?

50:45.716 --> 50:49.438
Hey! I'm gonna blow
your head off, you piece of shit!

50:49.518 --> 50:51.905
No, don't, Elyse.

50:51.985 --> 50:53.827
I'm fine.

50:57.687 --> 50:59.193
Zoe.

51:34.216 --> 51:35.500
Hey.

51:40.550 --> 51:42.420
So what have you found?

51:42.951 --> 51:46.868
Based on the blood sample I took,
his hormone levels are off the chart.

51:47.317 --> 51:49.371
I have never seen anything like it.

51:49.751 --> 51:52.104
So you think that's what stopped the virus?

51:52.584 --> 51:54.338
Well, possibly.

51:54.418 --> 51:57.387
But there are nine hormonal glands,
and I don't know which one it is.

51:57.467 --> 52:01.972
If I can find the source, I might be able
to extract it to produce a testable vaccine.

52:02.851 --> 52:05.304
Okay. All right, so what do you need?

52:06.383 --> 52:09.393
I need live virus samples
from living rotters.

52:10.417 --> 52:13.237
Look, maybe we can round some up
from outside to bring in for tests.

52:13.317 --> 52:15.438
No! Absolutely not.

52:15.518 --> 52:18.571
I mean, you know how much I've
risked letting that thing stay here?

52:18.651 --> 52:21.671
Look, I need the live samples
to compare to Max's.

52:21.751 --> 52:24.304
It is the only way to know
which hormone it is.

52:25.283 --> 52:27.682
Please, Baca, there must be a safer way.

52:33.650 --> 52:35.538
The perimeter gate.

52:36.317 --> 52:40.554
We can use the doors to file them in
one by one in a contained setting.

52:40.634 --> 52:43.126
Okay. When can we do it?

52:44.350 --> 52:45.974
Tonight.

52:49.216 --> 52:53.204
<i>Main gate is now opening.
Nine-A, prepare to initiate.</i>

52:53.284 --> 52:57.371
<i>Please stand clear.
All personnel remain in your sector.</i>

52:58.250 --> 53:01.471
<i>All right, team.
We do this fast, we do this efficiently.</i>

53:01.551 --> 53:04.970
<i>Nobody play hero here.
We let in one rotter at a time.</i>

53:05.050 --> 53:07.104
<i>Bravo on the gate. Alpha on the rotters.</i>

53:07.184 --> 53:10.594
<i>I don't want Zoe in there
until we have that rotter secured.</i>

53:31.249 --> 53:33.660
- Let's go fishing.
- Let's do this.

53:42.082 --> 53:45.566
- Let them in one at a time.
- Weapons hot!

53:48.800 --> 53:49.977
Ready!

53:51.083 --> 53:52.593
Go!

53:58.451 --> 54:01.070
Derek, you're up! Hold him still!

54:01.150 --> 54:03.826
- All secured.
- Zoe!

54:06.717 --> 54:10.127
We got multiple bogies incoming!
We need to hurry!

54:16.249 --> 54:17.490
Got it.

54:18.783 --> 54:21.771
- Clear!
- Okay, we got the test sample!

54:21.851 --> 54:23.300
Just one more!

54:26.466 --> 54:29.337
Go! Move! Move your fucking asses!

54:29.617 --> 54:31.626
Go, go, go!

54:32.004 --> 54:36.057
They're breaching! Step away!
What the hell is taking so long?

54:36.137 --> 54:39.107
- I got him.
- They're ready to breach! Fall back!

54:39.187 --> 54:43.270
Fall back! Baca, the fence is buckling!

54:43.350 --> 54:46.057
We can't hold it! Run!

54:55.033 --> 54:57.003
Go, go, go, go!

54:57.083 --> 54:58.693
Go!

55:11.249 --> 55:12.557
Zoe.

55:23.017 --> 55:24.837
You think I'm scared of you?

55:24.917 --> 55:28.992
I've killed hundreds of you fucking rotters.
I can't wait to put a bullet in you, too.

55:36.849 --> 55:38.693
She's your girlfriend.

55:42.083 --> 55:44.360
That conniving bitch.

55:47.283 --> 55:50.293
<i>Commander, come quick!
Something's happening outside!</i>

55:55.584 --> 55:58.237
<i>Initiating emergency shutdown procedure.</i>

55:58.317 --> 56:01.220
- <i>All personnel please fall back.</i>
- Get the gates!

56:01.300 --> 56:03.304
Move your fucking asses!

56:03.384 --> 56:06.060
Go faster! They're right behind us!

56:06.916 --> 56:09.326
Go! Go! Go! Come on.

56:17.216 --> 56:20.293
How in the fuck did the rotters
get inside the perimeter fence?

56:23.416 --> 56:26.693
- We were getting blood samples.
- You just let them in?

56:29.056 --> 56:30.611
What the fuck?

56:38.016 --> 56:40.092
What the hell are you doing?

56:40.617 --> 56:43.537
My job. Protecting you people.

56:43.617 --> 56:46.595
Lieutenant, please.

56:46.675 --> 56:48.947
- Zoe can help.
- It's too late. There's nothing she can do.

56:49.027 --> 56:52.358
It's not a head bite! The infection
takes time with a bite like hers!

56:52.438 --> 56:55.097
The vaccine can work if it hasn't spread yet!

56:56.516 --> 56:58.527
Do you have the vaccine right now?

57:01.983 --> 57:03.792
I didn't think so.

57:08.456 --> 57:10.367
Are you fucking insane?

57:10.916 --> 57:13.216
- One bite, one bullet.
- Just because you have a gun...

57:13.296 --> 57:16.803
...it does not mean you get to decide
who lives and who fucking dies!

57:16.883 --> 57:18.310
Are you sure about that?

57:19.849 --> 57:21.703
I thought I told you to not talk back to me.

57:21.783 --> 57:23.371
Miguel...

57:24.000 --> 57:25.876
...put the gun down.

57:35.517 --> 57:38.171
12 hours. Then I kill it.

57:38.651 --> 57:40.927
Vaccine or no vaccine.

57:46.450 --> 57:49.054
Miguel! Wait up!

57:54.517 --> 57:56.670
What the fuck was that back there?

57:56.750 --> 58:00.054
Pointing a gun on Zoe like that?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

58:00.134 --> 58:03.104
No, I'm a commanding officer whose own
fucking brother went behind his back...

58:03.184 --> 58:06.270
- ...and put this whole place in danger!
- Zoe needed those samples for all of us...

58:06.350 --> 58:08.504
- ...and you know that!
- So you follow her orders now?

58:08.584 --> 58:12.760
Let me remind you who's in charge.
Not her, not you, not anybody else.

58:12.840 --> 58:16.304
Miguel, you're cracking. I get it,
but that back there was bullshit!

58:16.384 --> 58:18.571
No, I'm the only one thinking rationally.

58:18.650 --> 58:21.184
Everyone's chasing her empty
promises about this vaccine.

58:21.264 --> 58:24.471
I'm your brother, Baca.
Your own flesh and blood.

58:24.551 --> 58:27.174
Believe me when I tell you she's fooling you.

58:28.283 --> 58:32.107
Don't you see what she's doing?
Why do you think she keeps this thing alive?

58:33.283 --> 58:34.970
What are you trying to say?

58:35.050 --> 58:39.226
That rotter has her name engraved
on his arm. Wake up, Baca!

59:41.283 --> 59:43.126
I'm sorry about Elyse.

59:44.749 --> 59:46.846
I know you two were close.

59:48.049 --> 59:49.859
Thanks, Baca.

59:57.916 --> 01:00:01.380
Zoe, I need you to tell me
that you can really do this vaccine.

01:00:05.083 --> 01:00:06.970
You losing faith in me?

01:00:08.449 --> 01:00:11.494
Of course not. It's just...

01:00:13.882 --> 01:00:15.959
I mean, you don't get it.

01:00:17.016 --> 01:00:20.103
Thomas, Elyse...

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:22.924
...I ordered them out there for you...

01:00:23.004 --> 01:00:25.660
...for your vaccine. And they died.

01:00:27.516 --> 01:00:29.469
You're blaming me?

01:00:29.548 --> 01:00:32.551
Do you really think I would risk their
lives if I didn't think it was worth it?

01:00:32.631 --> 01:00:34.428
Honestly, I don't know
what to believe with you.

01:00:34.508 --> 01:00:37.933
- What the fuck does that mean?
- What the fuck is that thing to you?

01:00:38.517 --> 01:00:42.760
That thing has your name
carved into his forearm.

01:00:48.483 --> 01:00:50.938
You're hiding something from me, Zoe.

01:00:51.687 --> 01:00:53.526
So I need you to tell me.

01:00:56.249 --> 01:00:58.127
Who was that thing to you?

01:01:01.949 --> 01:01:04.026
He was a fucking psycho...

01:01:04.882 --> 01:01:06.726
...who tried to rape me.

01:01:07.982 --> 01:01:10.026
Tried to take what he wanted from me.

01:01:12.316 --> 01:01:14.193
That's who he was.

01:01:16.416 --> 01:01:18.004
There.

01:01:18.513 --> 01:01:20.559
You happy now?

01:01:21.866 --> 01:01:23.726
Do you feel better?

01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:27.592
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- Because...

01:01:28.782 --> 01:01:30.626
...every time...

01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:33.104
...I talk...

01:01:33.184 --> 01:01:34.737
...think...

01:01:35.417 --> 01:01:37.292
...or look at him...

01:01:38.383 --> 01:01:41.973
...I have to relive the worst
fucking day of my life.

01:01:44.676 --> 01:01:47.926
Right now, I just need you to trust me
and believe in me, Baca.

01:01:51.816 --> 01:01:53.693
And if you can't...

01:01:57.749 --> 01:01:59.759
...I'll go it alone.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.401
Let's drink tonight for those
who are no longer here.

01:02:59.383 --> 01:03:02.637
To Frank. Loving husband.

01:03:03.017 --> 01:03:05.037
Well, you know, here's to Thomas...

01:03:05.117 --> 01:03:08.487
...a guy that made
each one of us a better person.

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:11.609
And to Elyse. I'll miss her dearly.

01:03:15.283 --> 01:03:16.903
To friends.

01:03:16.983 --> 01:03:18.392
- To friends.
- Friends.

01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:35.370
Hey, doc.

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:39.386
Figured you could use this.
I know you been going at it a while.

01:03:39.466 --> 01:03:41.276
Thanks, Alphonse.

01:03:51.149 --> 01:03:53.093
Man, you're ugly.

01:03:54.532 --> 01:03:56.077
Don't get too close.

01:03:57.816 --> 01:03:59.903
The lieutenant is right...

01:03:59.983 --> 01:04:03.392
- ...we should just kill this slippery fuck.
- Stand down, Lucy.

01:04:05.219 --> 01:04:06.599
Max!

01:04:09.983 --> 01:04:11.830
Did he bite you?

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:14.093
I don't think so.

01:04:18.415 --> 01:04:20.826
No, you're good. He didn't get you.

01:04:22.449 --> 01:04:24.603
Lucy, you need to get some ice
on that head wound.

01:04:24.683 --> 01:04:27.552
- Al, take her down to the med ward.
- Come with me.

01:04:41.016 --> 01:04:42.889
One day...

01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:46.889
...and you're back trying
to fuck up my life again.

01:04:51.499 --> 01:04:54.174
Zoe.

01:05:05.132 --> 01:05:06.675
What?

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:22.392
You're nothing...

01:05:23.382 --> 01:05:25.193
...but filth.

01:05:26.249 --> 01:05:29.583
You are...

01:05:29.663 --> 01:05:31.462
...mine.

01:06:15.833 --> 01:06:18.676
- Zoe!
- Shut up!

01:06:24.582 --> 01:06:26.660
I have had enough of this!

01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:31.183
I know what you're trying to do,
and it is not going to work.

01:06:31.483 --> 01:06:33.470
I only have a few hours to stop this virus...

01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:37.222
...and nothing you say or do
is going to fucking stop me!

01:06:48.016 --> 01:06:52.670
<i>Commencement of testing
for patient 15009, Max.</i>

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:55.203
<i>Beginning with current hypothesis of samples.</i>

01:06:55.283 --> 01:06:57.924
<i>Homo sapiens blood and anomaly cells...</i>

01:06:58.004 --> 01:07:00.737
<i>...otherwise known as rotter's blood.</i>

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:04.270
<i>Current tests show that Homo sapiens
blood, despite the different amounts...</i>

01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:07.303
<i>...all react consistently with our tests.</i>

01:07:07.383 --> 01:07:09.770
<i>The virus shows no signs of letting up.</i>

01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:13.737
<i>It has, and always will,
infect us at alarming rates.</i>

01:07:13.817 --> 01:07:16.470
<i>Patient 15009's blood, however...</i>

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:20.303
<i>...shows signs of dormant activity
within all human blood cells.</i>

01:07:20.383 --> 01:07:23.070
<i>They appear to coexist
without any signs of threat...</i>

01:07:23.149 --> 01:07:25.770
<i>...or exigency to our living blood samples.</i>

01:07:26.249 --> 01:07:31.470
<i>Despite the fact the idea of his blood in
anybody, let alone mine, is nauseating...</i>

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:34.837
<i>...this is critical
for my hypothesis for the cure.</i>

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:37.403
<i>So here comes the moment of truth.</i>

01:07:37.483 --> 01:07:40.570
<i>Testing patient 15009's blood...</i>

01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:43.037
<i>...against the anomaly rotter cells.</i>

01:07:43.116 --> 01:07:47.720
<i>If this works, patient 15009's blood
can be effectively engaged...</i>

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.237
<i>...in our bloodstream to kill off
any rotter cells before it spreads.</i>

01:07:52.767 --> 01:07:57.370
<i>Patient 15009's blood is the answer
to destroying the rotter cells...</i>

01:07:57.450 --> 01:07:59.607
<i>...in infected bodies...</i>

01:07:59.817 --> 01:08:02.026
<i>...if we aren't too late.</i>

01:08:04.482 --> 01:08:07.459
Baca? Come down here right now.

01:08:12.848 --> 01:08:14.406
You...

01:08:14.486 --> 01:08:17.283
...are mine.

01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:29.049
Oh, hey. Zoe, Zoe, what's the matter?

01:08:29.129 --> 01:08:31.359
- It's Max, he's free.
- Where is he?

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:32.926
- In the med lab.
- Let's go!

01:08:33.006 --> 01:08:35.693
No head shots! I need him alive!

01:08:41.682 --> 01:08:43.537
- Fuck!
- Shit!

01:08:43.617 --> 01:08:47.126
Sound the alarm. We need everyone
to get back to the township, now!

01:08:49.549 --> 01:08:53.649
<i>Emergency. All military personnel
please report to your squadron.</i>

01:08:54.049 --> 01:08:58.069
<i>Civilians are advised to remain
secured in the township.</i>

01:08:58.149 --> 01:09:03.383
<i>Emergency. All civilians are advised
to remain secured in the township.</i>

01:09:03.462 --> 01:09:06.339
<i>All residents to the township. I repeat...</i>

01:09:06.419 --> 01:09:09.296
<i>...everyone report
to the township immediately.</i>

01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:13.459
<i>This is not a drill.
I repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

01:09:29.948 --> 01:09:31.470
Lily!

01:09:31.649 --> 01:09:33.837
Get everyone to the township!
I'll meet you there!

01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:36.727
- Be careful!
- I'll be okay!

01:09:55.365 --> 01:09:56.892
Mom?

01:09:58.915 --> 01:10:00.392
Mom?

01:10:08.382 --> 01:10:10.356
Oh, my God, Lily!
What are you doing out here?

01:10:10.436 --> 01:10:12.229
She's coming!

01:10:24.749 --> 01:10:27.092
Mommy, no! Please don't!

01:10:32.116 --> 01:10:34.570
- What's wrong? What's going on?
- Is something happening?

01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:36.934
- What do we do?
- Is it the rotters?

01:10:37.014 --> 01:10:39.370
- Quiet! Calm down, all right?
- Baca, is something happening?

01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:41.259
What the hell happened?

01:10:42.948 --> 01:10:44.903
It's the rotter.

01:10:44.983 --> 01:10:46.660
He's loose inside the complex.

01:10:53.299 --> 01:10:56.510
Don't worry. Everyone go back to your bed.
Everything's under control.

01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:58.346
- Lieutenant, something is not right.
- We need to know.

01:10:58.426 --> 01:11:02.092
Please, everything's okay.
Just go back to your homes.

01:11:10.281 --> 01:11:12.169
You happy now, Baca?

01:11:12.249 --> 01:11:15.048
I told you not to trust Zoe.
Find that rotter, kill it.

01:11:15.128 --> 01:11:17.381
No, we need to take it alive. There's
a chance we can still get that vaccine.

01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:21.202
Anyone that fails to comply to
my orders will be executed on the spot.

01:11:21.282 --> 01:11:24.203
We got a problem in the motor pool.
Guards aren't responding.

01:11:24.283 --> 01:11:26.837
We gotta get to the motor pool. Lucy,
Alphonse, stay here, protect the people.

01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:29.192
- Everyone else on me!
- Copy that!

01:11:36.947 --> 01:11:38.560
Lily.

01:12:38.848 --> 01:12:40.492
Let her go.

01:12:41.282 --> 01:12:43.727
Zoe.

01:12:45.465 --> 01:12:47.908
Let her go, Max.

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:50.859
I...

01:12:52.948 --> 01:12:55.683
...came for you.

01:12:55.763 --> 01:12:58.183
You...

01:12:58.263 --> 01:13:01.326
...need me.

01:13:02.449 --> 01:13:04.426
You want me alive...

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:10.312
- ...let her go.
- No!

01:13:13.582 --> 01:13:15.472
Okay, okay.

01:13:16.848 --> 01:13:18.560
Now.

01:13:34.684 --> 01:13:37.009
<i>Main gate is now opening.</i>

01:13:46.515 --> 01:13:48.326
Let's go now!

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.175
No! No!

01:14:05.415 --> 01:14:06.958
Lily!

01:14:08.815 --> 01:14:10.262
Zoe!

01:14:25.415 --> 01:14:26.792
Zoe!

01:14:35.781 --> 01:14:38.008
Move! Move! Move!

01:14:52.416 --> 01:14:55.892
Lieutenant, what's the report
on the motor pool?

01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:02.504
Lieutenant, do you read me?

01:15:04.382 --> 01:15:05.809
Fuck!

01:15:18.599 --> 01:15:20.099
Shannon!

01:15:56.983 --> 01:15:58.802
Cover me! I'm going to close the door!

01:16:08.815 --> 01:16:12.550
Miguel, open that fucking door!
Lily and Zoe are still outside!

01:16:12.629 --> 01:16:15.685
I don't give a fuck! The rotters
got in because of that bitch Zoe.

01:16:15.765 --> 01:16:17.856
- That door stays closed.
- I am not leaving them outside!

01:16:17.936 --> 01:16:19.303
Stand down, Baca.

01:16:20.082 --> 01:16:23.223
So what, you're gonna shoot
your own brother now?

01:16:23.303 --> 01:16:25.359
I will if I have to.

01:16:27.881 --> 01:16:29.558
Don't make me do it.

01:16:36.182 --> 01:16:37.393
Miguel!

01:17:09.548 --> 01:17:13.503
<i>Main gate is now opening. Please stand clear.</i>

01:17:13.582 --> 01:17:16.812
<i>Main gate is now opening. Please stand clear.</i>

01:17:26.948 --> 01:17:28.524
Lily!

01:17:30.515 --> 01:17:33.359
- Sweetie, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:17:35.115 --> 01:17:36.958
Here, come on.

01:17:38.416 --> 01:17:40.292
In here, sweetie.

01:18:54.615 --> 01:18:57.193
Zoe.

01:19:12.249 --> 01:19:15.768
You are...

01:19:15.848 --> 01:19:17.369
...mine!

01:19:17.448 --> 01:19:20.298
No. You're mine, motherfucker!

01:19:23.881 --> 01:19:25.858
Come on, Lil.

01:19:50.724 --> 01:19:52.558
Baca, don't!

01:20:05.282 --> 01:20:07.125
It's too late.

01:20:07.948 --> 01:20:10.825
I can feel it in my body.

01:20:12.682 --> 01:20:15.137
It's... it's turning me.

01:20:15.686 --> 01:20:17.703
You haven't fully turned yet.

01:20:18.482 --> 01:20:20.503
The vaccine can still work.

01:20:21.253 --> 01:20:22.775
No.

01:20:24.815 --> 01:20:27.203
I don't wanna be one of those things, Zoe.

01:20:27.682 --> 01:20:29.491
Baca, please.

01:20:31.681 --> 01:20:34.558
- I'm sorry.
- I can stop the virus.

01:20:37.748 --> 01:20:39.658
Believe me.

01:20:40.982 --> 01:20:43.731
I can stop the virus.

01:20:44.314 --> 01:20:46.186
You just have to trust me.

01:20:49.515 --> 01:20:51.358
I love you, Baca.

01:21:06.075 --> 01:21:08.602
<i>I've used up what I could from patient...</i>

01:21:08.682 --> 01:21:11.103
<i>...from Max's blood on Baca.</i>

01:21:11.782 --> 01:21:15.103
<i>I could only dispense so much
as I need the remaining samples...</i>

01:21:15.183 --> 01:21:19.003
<i>...to create a mass production
schedule for the antivirus.</i>

01:21:19.832 --> 01:21:23.802
<i>I dislike the idea that Baca
is technically and conveniently...</i>

01:21:23.882 --> 01:21:26.203
<i>...my first human test subject.</i>

01:21:26.622 --> 01:21:29.036
<i>This will speed things up
in getting the antivirus...</i>

01:21:29.116 --> 01:21:31.788
<i>...into mass production for everybody.</i>

01:21:46.115 --> 01:21:49.736
<i>To everybody out there,
to anyone who is listening...</i>

01:21:49.816 --> 01:21:53.169
<i>...I'm broadcasting this
from High Rock emergency bunker.</i>

01:21:53.248 --> 01:21:57.063
<i>Our doors are open. We have
an inoculation against the rotter bite...</i>

01:21:57.782 --> 01:22:01.258
...a vaccine that will keep anyone
who takes it from turning.

01:22:02.681 --> 01:22:04.970
From now on, when you greet the day...

01:22:05.849 --> 01:22:08.925
<i>...know this world is not
as dangerous as it used to be.</i>

01:22:10.214 --> 01:22:11.923
<i>Things are changing.</i>

01:22:12.582 --> 01:22:15.169
<i>And while we can't put the world back...</i>

01:22:16.198 --> 01:22:18.474
<i>...there's still beauty in it.</i>

01:22:19.381 --> 01:22:22.391
<i>There's still hope that we can be safe...</i>

01:22:23.815 --> 01:22:27.070
<i>...and that it's okay for us
to let our guard down now...</i>

01:22:27.949 --> 01:22:29.725
<i>...to be happy...</i>

01:22:31.214 --> 01:22:33.025
<i>...and to love.</i>
