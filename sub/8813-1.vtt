01:45.750 --> 01:49.791
It's my turn for breakfast
this morning, Gromit.

01:49.917 --> 01:52.166
I'd like
a three-minute egg...

01:52.292 --> 01:54.249
Oh, steady on.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.458
Whoa, Gromit!

01:56.584 --> 01:58.166
Oh!

02:14.459 --> 02:18.416
Well, that went as well
as could be expected,

02:18.542 --> 02:21.374
didn't it, hmm?

02:21.500 --> 02:26.499
Though I might have to make
a small adjustment to the drop.

02:26.625 --> 02:29.124
A touch painful on re-entry.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.749
Cracking toast, Gromit.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.958
Any post, was there,
perchance?

02:48.292 --> 02:50.333
Oh, dear, a bit steep.

02:50.459 --> 02:53.083
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I'll be...

02:53.209 --> 02:55.833
They're all bills.
Oh, dear, oh, dear me.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.416
We shall have
to economize, Gromit.

02:59.542 --> 03:01.499
I'll have to let
that room out.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.249
Oh, dear.

03:20.875 --> 03:23.708
Oh, just look at that.

03:23.834 --> 03:26.458
I'm down
to my last few coppers.

03:26.584 --> 03:28.708
And those presents
weren't cheap either.

03:31.792 --> 03:36.083
Well, Gromit, let's see what's
on the 9:05, shall we, hmm?

03:38.209 --> 03:39.666
Here she comes now.

03:42.209 --> 03:44.833
I wonder what this can be.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.458
Happy birthday! Chuck!

03:55.084 --> 03:59.333
I knew you'd like it.
Here, let me help you.

04:01.792 --> 04:05.166
You look like somebody
owns you now.

04:05.292 --> 04:07.874
And that's only
the first part.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.916
Come and look in here.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.624
I think you'll
find this present

04:38.750 --> 04:41.749
a valuable addition
to our modern lifestyle.

04:43.042 --> 04:45.999
They're techno-trousers.

04:46.125 --> 04:47.583
Ex-NASA.

04:47.709 --> 04:49.916
Fantastic for walkies.

04:50.042 --> 04:55.041
All you do is attach
the lead on here.

04:55.167 --> 04:57.458
Then program in.

04:57.584 --> 05:00.083
Walkies, 10 minutes,
20 minutes.

05:00.209 --> 05:01.166
Whoops!

05:06.459 --> 05:08.958
Have a nice walk,
Gromit.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.958
Oh...

05:29.084 --> 05:32.791
It's no use prevaricating
about the bush.

05:49.459 --> 05:51.958
Nice walkies, hmm?

05:53.417 --> 05:56.416
How were the techno-trousers?

06:00.500 --> 06:03.791
Oh, there's someone
at the door, Gromit.

06:05.209 --> 06:06.791
I wonder who that could be.

06:09.042 --> 06:11.749
Oh, it's about the room, then.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.374
Well, that's grand.

06:13.500 --> 06:17.291
Eh, would you like to come
this way and inspect?

06:18.917 --> 06:21.416
I'm asking 20 a week.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.416
That would include
your breakfast.

06:26.709 --> 06:30.416
I suppose you like
kippers, do you?

06:30.542 --> 06:33.291
Partial to a nice
black pudding, myself,

06:33.417 --> 06:35.874
with bacon, of course.

06:40.334 --> 06:43.291
I'm sure that we can come
to an amicable agreement.

06:43.417 --> 06:47.791
As I say, it's a bit dingy
at present.

06:47.917 --> 06:50.874
But it's surprising
what a lick of paint will do,

06:51.000 --> 06:52.249
isn't it?

06:55.459 --> 06:57.249
Oh! But I don't think...

06:58.875 --> 07:02.708
That wasn't quite
what we had in mind.

07:02.834 --> 07:04.791
Wouldn't you like to see-

07:04.917 --> 07:06.499
Oh, dear.

07:08.125 --> 07:09.749
Look...

07:09.875 --> 07:12.874
there's something
I've got to tell you.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.999
It's, um...
no pets.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.208
Does that suit you?

07:23.209 --> 07:26.583
Oh. Seems pleasant enough.

07:26.709 --> 07:28.416
Cheer up, Gromit.

07:28.542 --> 07:31.999
Surprising what a lick of paint
will do, isn't it?

07:48.084 --> 07:49.458
Oh.

07:53.792 --> 07:56.916
Oh, so that's where
my braces went.

08:06.459 --> 08:09.624
Wonderful things,
these techno-trousers.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.958
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

09:37.750 --> 09:39.874
Lovely morning, Gromit.

09:58.167 --> 09:59.333
Oh!

10:01.542 --> 10:04.374
Thank you very much.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.916
That's just grand.

10:15.959 --> 10:18.041
Oh, thank you kindly.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.374
What do you think of that,
then, Gromit?

10:20.500 --> 10:22.833
Eh? Our paying guest.

10:35.250 --> 10:38.499
Nice drop
of Bordeaux, this, eh?

10:38.625 --> 10:40.249
Here's to paying guests.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.583
More cheese, Penguin? Eh?

11:19.334 --> 11:22.958
Good night, Penguin.
Sleep well.

12:19.417 --> 12:20.874
Oh.

12:21.584 --> 12:24.541
That was lovely cheese.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.541
Oh-oh-oh. Oh.

12:26.667 --> 12:27.958
Yeow!

12:32.084 --> 12:34.624
It's the wrong trousers.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.833
The wrong trousers!

12:36.959 --> 12:39.708
What have you done
with the controls, Gromit?

12:43.084 --> 12:45.291
Now, that'll do.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.583
Just hold on a minute.

12:47.709 --> 12:49.874
Stop it. Gromit!

12:50.000 --> 12:53.291
Stop these confounded things!

12:53.417 --> 12:55.624
This isn't funny, Gromit.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.916
The joke's over.

12:59.042 --> 13:01.666
Get me out of these trousers!

13:02.875 --> 13:04.416
Lovely day!

13:21.542 --> 13:23.124
Help!

13:23.250 --> 13:24.916
Gromit!

13:25.042 --> 13:27.499
Gangway!

13:29.125 --> 13:30.541
Sorry!

13:34.375 --> 13:36.541
Whoa!

13:36.667 --> 13:41.083
It's the wrong trousers, Gromit,
and they've gone wrong.

13:41.209 --> 13:45.291
Stop them, Gromit! Stop them!
Help me!

13:45.417 --> 13:48.916
Gromit, the trousers
have gone haywire.

13:49.042 --> 13:51.458
Get me out!

13:51.584 --> 13:54.624
Help!

14:16.917 --> 14:18.791
Oh, I'm tired.

14:18.917 --> 14:22.541
A good doze,
that's what I need:

14:22.667 --> 14:25.166
get me strength back.

14:26.334 --> 14:29.624
What a...
what a shocking calami...

14:29.750 --> 14:33.333
calami... calamity.

23:13.459 --> 23:16.499
What's the game, then?
Where am I?

23:16.625 --> 23:19.666
What's going on? Yikes!

23:22.875 --> 23:25.083
Gromit!

23:25.250 --> 23:27.624
Gromit!

23:30.459 --> 23:32.333
I must be dreaming.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.166
Where the devil am I?

23:36.292 --> 23:38.083
Oh!

23:38.209 --> 23:40.708
Great heavens above.

23:40.834 --> 23:42.458
Whatever is it?

23:42.584 --> 23:45.333
Help! Get me down!

23:45.459 --> 23:46.833
Help!

23:49.042 --> 23:53.916
What's the game, then? Eh?
Where am I?

23:54.042 --> 23:56.124
That's quite enough.

23:56.250 --> 23:59.374
You'll be hearing
from my solicitor about this.

24:01.834 --> 24:03.833
Mind how you go.

24:03.959 --> 24:06.291
You can't go taking liberties
like this.

24:06.417 --> 24:08.708
I'm a respectable citizen.

24:15.417 --> 24:18.291
Most definitely
not legal, this.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.833
Good grief, it's you!

24:26.959 --> 24:29.958
Now, let me out
of these trousers this minute.

24:31.709 --> 24:33.791
Steady on, will you?

24:33.917 --> 24:36.666
This wardrobe's nearly new,
you know.

24:36.792 --> 24:38.499
Let me out!

24:38.625 --> 24:41.791
I'll give you what for,
you tyke!

24:47.125 --> 24:50.208
Excuse me.
Uh, hello?

24:51.459 --> 24:54.583
I should think so too.
Hey!

24:56.750 --> 25:00.749
Well, this is a fine
how-do-you-do, isn't it, Gromit?

25:02.209 --> 25:03.333
Steady on.

25:03.459 --> 25:06.124
Watch where you're putting
them paws.

25:07.417 --> 25:08.291
Oh, careful, lad.

25:10.667 --> 25:13.249
Oh, my goodness.
It'll ruin the woodwork.

25:15.250 --> 25:18.208
Oh, there goes
me knotty pine.

25:18.334 --> 25:20.333
Where are we going?

25:20.459 --> 25:23.416
I can't see a thing.

25:23.542 --> 25:25.624
What's happening?

25:28.834 --> 25:31.166
Catch me, Gromit.

25:58.834 --> 26:01.124
Don't worry, Gromit!

26:01.250 --> 26:04.749
I'm-whoa-
right behind you!

26:08.250 --> 26:12.374
Hang in there, Gromit.
Everything's under control.

26:14.792 --> 26:17.833
I'll have that,
if you don't mind, eh?

26:29.334 --> 26:32.041
Tally-ho!

26:32.167 --> 26:35.541
Leave him to me.
I'll get the bounder!

26:43.750 --> 26:45.416
Get him, Gromit!

26:50.084 --> 26:52.416
Gromit, we're doomed.

26:58.459 --> 27:00.749
Mind the table, Gromit!

27:09.584 --> 27:10.916
Gotcha!

27:11.584 --> 27:12.583
Huh?

27:14.084 --> 27:15.749
All yours, Gromit!

27:31.625 --> 27:34.416
Attaboy, Gromit, lad!

27:35.500 --> 27:39.291
Well done.
We did it. Ha-ha!

28:06.459 --> 28:08.958
Thank you, old friend.

28:09.084 --> 28:11.624
Many thanks indeed.

28:12.292 --> 28:15.874
That reward money
paid off all our debts.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.124
No more lodgers.

28:18.250 --> 28:20.291
More trouble
than they're worth.

28:23.042 --> 28:26.333
I could just fancy
some cheese, Gromit.

28:26.459 --> 28:27.624
What do you say?

28:27.750 --> 28:28.916
Cheddar?

28:30.667 --> 28:32.999
Don't forget
the crackers.

28:40.167 --> 28:44.124
Ah, all's well that ends well;
that's what I say.

28:44.625 --> 28:45.833
Mmm.

28:53.584 --> 28:57.416
Oh, I do like a bit
of Gorgonzola.
