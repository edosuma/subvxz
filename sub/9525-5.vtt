08:03.357 --> 08:04.692
Remember?

08:04.858 --> 08:06.763
Um, so we're going
into Hollywood, right?

08:06.888 --> 08:08.196
Our flight is at 7:00.

08:08.362 --> 08:11.000
Right, 7:00.
So, since your flight's so soon,

08:11.125 --> 08:13.701
we were thinking we could just
keep it real around here,

08:13.867 --> 08:15.203
in Rancho Cucamonga,

08:15.369 --> 08:17.705
which is also known
as Hollywood east.

08:17.871 --> 08:19.165
I don't know if you knew that,
but, you know,

08:19.331 --> 08:21.751
if you guys want to go
to the old Hollywood... blegh!

08:21.917 --> 08:23.586
- Oh, meh.
- It stinks. It sucks.

08:23.752 --> 08:25.672
This is great.
Uh, we can do that later.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.382
Um, I doubt you'll want to,

08:27.507 --> 08:29.300
because I got
a skateboarding celebrity

08:29.810 --> 08:31.753
right here for you.
Blake Anderson...

08:31.878 --> 08:33.289
[Girls laugh]
Champion of the ramp.

08:33.414 --> 08:36.457
What's up, Brajettes?
[All laughing]

08:36.582 --> 08:38.017
Very gnar to meet you.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.602
What do you say we ramp things up

08:39.768 --> 08:42.063
and, uh, just kind of... oh!

08:42.229 --> 08:44.274
Yeah, kick-flip it inside?

08:44.440 --> 08:45.275
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

08:45.441 --> 08:47.861
Oh, I'm landing these tricks, dude.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.113
Okay, so, why don't we head
into the office party

08:50.279 --> 08:52.173
real quick, because Hollywood
doesn't really start popping

08:52.298 --> 08:53.867
until like 5:30, 6:00 anyway.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.011
Yeah, well, that's
when David Beckham comes out.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.245
You know David?
[All laughing]

08:57.411 --> 08:58.480
- Uh, let me just...
- Oh.

08:58.605 --> 08:59.789
- Sorry... it's just...
- Ooh.

08:59.955 --> 09:03.952
You have to get out of it,
sweetheart, all right.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.587
- I love skateboarding.
- Oh, really?

09:05.712 --> 09:07.623
Yeah, I actually own
a Wendy's with Shaun white.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.007
Oh, wow.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.392
All right, welcome, welcome.

09:10.517 --> 09:13.845
Who wants a disaronno on the rocks?

09:15.422 --> 09:16.899
What... what happened?

09:17.181 --> 09:22.103
♪ Oh mama this surely
is a dream yeah ♪

09:23.937 --> 09:26.073
♪ yeah mama this must be my ♪

09:26.357 --> 09:30.444
♪ dream ♪

09:30.569 --> 09:33.156
Whoo.
[Sporadic applause]

09:33.322 --> 09:34.616
Thank you. Thank you!

09:34.782 --> 09:38.586
This goes out to Homegirl's
two favorite things...

09:38.711 --> 09:39.871
Sex and candy.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.080
Let's give it up.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.333
Let's give it up.
We'll miss you, Homegirl!

09:43.499 --> 09:45.710
[Applause]
You're an angel.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.930
She was a strong woman.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.465
She could lift anything, it was nuts.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.217
It was nuts.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.902
Ders, Blake?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.471
Do you have anything to say
about our fallen comrade?

09:56.637 --> 09:57.940
Mm-mm.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.349
She was nice.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.851
Nice? Nice!

10:02.017 --> 10:03.770
She was a lot more than nice.

10:03.936 --> 10:08.505
She was a...
A king of the hill.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.888
She was a legend...
Of the fall.

10:12.013 --> 10:16.407
She was Malcolm,
when Malcolm was in the middle.

10:16.573 --> 10:18.826
She was an ultimate fighter
till the end.

10:18.992 --> 10:20.896
I never told her I loved her.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.299
I got her pregnant,
but she didn't want to have it.

10:23.424 --> 10:25.625
And... and now there's nothing
left of her.

10:25.791 --> 10:26.668
Uh-oh.

10:27.095 --> 10:28.972
Ah, it's okay, bud.
That's okay.

10:29.097 --> 10:30.740
That stuff you just keep to yourself

10:30.865 --> 10:33.776
and never tell a soul, all right?

10:33.901 --> 10:35.578
Someone died in your office,

10:35.703 --> 10:38.748
and you invited us to party here?

10:38.873 --> 10:43.085
Yeah, because, uh, in America,
we like to celebrate

10:43.210 --> 10:45.454
life after death, so...

10:45.579 --> 10:50.760
So, we should probably just go
take some Jager bombs at the bar

10:50.885 --> 10:52.360
in memorandum of Homegirl.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.564
Uh-huh, and then we can get
back to the VIP lounge.

10:54.689 --> 10:55.780
Come on over here.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.533
You guys able to sleep yet?

10:57.658 --> 10:59.659
Every time I close
my eyes I see her face.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.452
- Mm-mm.
- I tried counting sheep,

11:01.618 --> 11:04.163
but they just turned
into wooly little Homegirls.

11:04.329 --> 11:05.999
And their naying.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.751
Naa-ver forget.
Naa-ver forget!

11:08.917 --> 11:10.545
- Naa...
- Jillian, just a bucket

11:10.670 --> 11:12.338
- of beers and some whiskey?
- All right.

11:12.504 --> 11:14.149
- Sorry about that.
- Excuse me.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.550
I hope you girls weren't
planning on leaving,

11:15.675 --> 11:16.926
'cause you guys are my best friends.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.921
- Uh...
- By the way, my name's Adam.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.889
You guys are like a shining light.

11:22.055 --> 11:24.017
I'm so sorry to hear about...

11:24.184 --> 11:25.860
Homegirl.

11:25.985 --> 11:29.314
Yeah, I'm pretty butthurt about it.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.982
How did she die?

11:31.148 --> 11:33.068
- [Sighs]
- Well, she went peacefully,

11:33.193 --> 11:34.694
thank God.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.327
But I was there the entire time,

11:37.452 --> 11:39.991
and the last thing she said
before she passed was,

11:40.157 --> 11:43.378
"Adam, you're the best,
and I love you the most

11:43.503 --> 11:46.539
out of everyone."
And then she was gone.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.217
Brain tumor.

11:48.342 --> 11:50.335
The doctor said it was
the size of a p'zone.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.288
Oh, wow.

11:52.413 --> 11:54.964
My grandmother died from
a brain tumor about a year ago.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.216
- Really?
- It was hard at first,

11:57.382 --> 12:01.012
but it gets better.

12:01.178 --> 12:04.067
I know I don't know
you two very well,

12:04.192 --> 12:07.136
but it would help me out a lot

12:07.261 --> 12:11.674
if you guys could stick around,
just a little bit.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.142
Yeah.

12:13.267 --> 12:14.734
We can do that.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.380
Thank you. Thank you,
I'm so emotional right now.

12:17.505 --> 12:20.116
I'm so... oh-ho-ho-ho...

12:20.241 --> 12:22.825
[Sobbing obnoxiously]

12:29.122 --> 12:31.793
{pub}You know, I probably shouldn't
use alcohol to drown the pain,

12:31.959 --> 12:35.571
but Homegirl loved century club.

12:35.696 --> 12:37.507
100 shots, 100 minutes.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.074
I'm in.
Let's do this.

12:39.199 --> 12:40.542
- [Ahem]
- Let's do this.

12:40.667 --> 12:41.810
It's an American thing.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.054
Um, if I could have your attention,

12:43.220 --> 12:45.147
I just wanted to let you know.

12:45.272 --> 12:48.351
Blake and I have channeled
our sadness

12:48.517 --> 12:51.854
regarding Homegirl's passing
into a charity

12:52.020 --> 12:53.189
in Homegirl's name.

12:53.355 --> 12:56.859
Homegirl's home
for girls without homes.

12:57.025 --> 13:00.597
Well I've also made an organization

13:00.722 --> 13:03.366
that's gonna raise money
to cure brain tumorism.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.968
It's called rollerblading
across the Americas.

13:05.093 --> 13:06.661
Oh, yeah?
North and South?

13:06.827 --> 13:09.580
And east and west if it'll
find a goddamn cure!

13:09.746 --> 13:12.208
Okay, well all the money
in the world isn't gonna

13:12.374 --> 13:14.335
do anything to bring Homegirl back.

13:14.501 --> 13:15.612
The only way to keep Homegirl alive

13:15.737 --> 13:18.172
is to name stuff after her,

13:18.338 --> 13:21.384
like charities or skateboard tricks.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.635
- Huh?
- Blake.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.638
- Uh. [Sighs]
- Show 'em.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.312
Homegirl!

13:33.478 --> 13:35.189
- Whoa.
- Forever.

13:35.355 --> 13:36.499
You didn't show her much respect by

13:36.624 --> 13:38.068
not using her real name.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.777
Yeah, well, obviously
it's... it's that then.

13:39.995 --> 13:41.705
- It's what then?
- It's her name... if that was...

13:41.830 --> 13:43.740
And what's her name, Ders?

13:43.865 --> 13:45.116
She had a name, dude.

13:45.282 --> 13:50.246
And her name was Roberta Paulson.

13:50.412 --> 13:54.667
Her name was Roberta Paulson.

13:54.833 --> 13:58.045
All:
Her name was Roberta Paulson!

13:58.211 --> 13:59.088
Guys...

13:59.254 --> 14:02.060
All:
Her name is Roberta Paulson!

14:02.185 --> 14:03.561
How do you say seance in Swedish?

14:03.686 --> 14:05.196
Uh...
[Speaks in Swedish]

14:05.321 --> 14:08.055
Then let us have...
[Speaks Swedish incorrectly]

14:08.221 --> 14:09.265
Alice, you've got
to shut it down now.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.558
What?

14:10.961 --> 14:13.144
Homegirl's wake.
Shut it down, now. Please.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.007
Nobody's butthurt.
Not anymore.

14:15.132 --> 14:16.647
We're all, uh, we're all butthealed.

14:16.813 --> 14:18.316
Yup, our butts are the picture
of perfect health.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.735
- Praise... praise the butt-God.
- The wake has to keep going.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.404
Her kids are on the way over
with some kind of video will.

14:23.570 --> 14:25.184
Whoa.
Whose video will?

14:25.309 --> 14:26.949
Is it like a cool little droid dude?

14:27.115 --> 14:30.244
No, it's like a video
with last words or wishes.

14:30.410 --> 14:31.957
Wait, no, but Adam's
up there going out of control

14:32.082 --> 14:33.539
on the mic device.
He was singing a song,

14:33.705 --> 14:35.227
and I don't know what
he's gonna do next.

14:35.352 --> 14:38.461
Ders. No, video will,
that's a great idea.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.765
You know, it would've been cool
if it was a robot.

14:40.890 --> 14:42.200
Video will?

14:42.325 --> 14:43.508
[Robot voice]
Video will. What's up?

14:43.674 --> 14:45.968
Mr. Nate Dogg.
Are you there?

14:46.134 --> 14:49.472
I just have but one question
for you, Mr. Nate Dogg.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.643
How do I make it into heaven?

14:51.768 --> 14:54.852
[Groaning, grunting]
Oh. Oh!

14:58.438 --> 15:02.254
Ay yay. Ay yay.

15:02.379 --> 15:05.530
Smoke weed every day.

15:07.614 --> 15:09.742
Luckily, I do,
so I guess I'm going to heaven.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.912
I feel now would be
a good time to contact Homegirl.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.968
Can we leave?
I want to see Ben Affleck

15:15.093 --> 15:16.165
at the wax museum.

15:16.331 --> 15:18.501
You know what?
Screw Homegirl.

15:18.667 --> 15:22.338
It's time to contact
your dead grandmother.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.798
Guys, again, sorry to interrupt,

15:24.069 --> 15:26.843
but I'm pretty sure I have
something way more important

15:27.072 --> 15:28.678
than whatever Adam's convinced
you he's doing.

15:28.907 --> 15:30.179
Oh, is it cartoons?

15:30.345 --> 15:32.185
Oh, thank God.
All I need is a good cartoon

15:32.310 --> 15:33.453
to take my mind off of things.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.685
Is it <i>Doug?</i>
Is it <i>Hey, Arnold?</i>

15:35.851 --> 15:37.424
No, no, Jillian,
it's not cartoons, okay?

15:37.549 --> 15:39.939
- If it was, it'd be <i>Beetlejuice.</i>
- Makes sense.

15:40.105 --> 15:43.130
But it's something, uh,
a little more meaningful.

15:43.255 --> 15:45.027
It's Homegirl's video will.

15:45.193 --> 15:48.239
- Here we go.
- Hey, y'all. It's me.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.838
If you're watching this, I'm a goner.

15:50.963 --> 15:52.994
But don't let that get you down.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.443
I think those are wise words.
Let's liven things up.

15:55.568 --> 15:56.873
Do you guys wanna
take care of your drinks?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.249
Yeah, because the longer you're sad,

15:58.415 --> 16:01.878
the longer I'm gonna spend in hell.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.047
So don't be so darn butthurt.

16:05.213 --> 16:07.800
- Mm.
- Amen to that, girl.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.510
I'd like to say
a special thank you to all

16:09.676 --> 16:11.794
you at Telamericorp,

16:11.919 --> 16:15.998
but mostly to Anders and Blake.

16:16.123 --> 16:17.226
Oh, did you hear that?

16:17.491 --> 16:18.868
They are just two gentlemen,

16:18.993 --> 16:21.188
and not only are their hearts tender,

16:21.354 --> 16:23.733
but I would guess to say that

16:23.899 --> 16:26.068
their penises are pretty tender too.

16:26.234 --> 16:27.403
- Whoa, did you hear that?
- So you might want to put

16:27.569 --> 16:29.113
'em in your mouth and find out.

16:29.337 --> 16:31.481
- I'd be having babies with 'em...
- Aha!

16:31.606 --> 16:33.576
I thought I knew it wasn't
really her for a second.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.051
Just have sex with Blake and Anders,

16:35.176 --> 16:36.329
not Adam, 'cause he's sad and stupid.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.830
No! No, be sad.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.689
- Be sad and butthurt.
- No.

16:39.814 --> 16:42.126
- Be butthurt and sad.
- Be happy and sex with Blake.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.627
He just said to have sex
with... no, she...

16:44.752 --> 16:47.798
[Overlapping arguing]

16:48.022 --> 16:49.383
You see what he was doing?

16:49.549 --> 16:51.034
He was face-timing.
This was a lie.

16:51.159 --> 16:52.762
- No, no.
- This is a lie.

16:52.928 --> 16:53.970
No, no, no, no, Adam, don't do this.

16:54.095 --> 16:57.274
I need this!
I just wanna screw these two

16:57.399 --> 16:59.310
swedes together like Ikea furniture.

16:59.476 --> 17:03.679
No, no, you declared
war on me when you didn't

17:03.804 --> 17:07.318

with those sexy foreigners.

17:10.904 --> 17:11.989
But you know what?

17:12.155 --> 17:14.450
Sadness is the real key to evoke

17:14.616 --> 17:17.578
- passion and sexuality.
- No, happiness!

17:17.743 --> 17:18.913
- It's happiness.
- It's sadness!

{pub}God, I love your mom.

17:57.784 --> 17:59.286
Loved, 'cause she's dead.

17:59.452 --> 18:01.539
'Cause, I'm kind
of the main office prankster.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.541
Second, of course, to Roberta.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.666
Who's Roberta?

18:05.791 --> 18:08.569
Your... mom.
Your mom, Roberta.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.715
Our mother's name
was Kristy Howard-Clark.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.259
All: What? [Muttering]

18:13.425 --> 18:14.574
- Was it?
- Kristy Howard-Clark.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.846
I've never heard that name before.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.946
So you didn't really know
this woman at all either?

18:20.071 --> 18:22.852
No, but, like,
what is knowing, nowadays?

18:23.018 --> 18:25.085
Okay, who are they...
Who are you?

18:25.210 --> 18:26.647
We're leaving.

18:26.813 --> 18:30.290
We just wanted to see
the goddamn Hollywood sign,

18:30.415 --> 18:32.153
and you ruined our last day
in America.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.194
You're not gonna throw out
our years of pen palling

18:34.319 --> 18:36.449
back and forth over one crazy day?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.299
I wrote you for two years.

18:38.424 --> 18:41.302
After middle school, you were
writing with my little brother.

18:41.427 --> 18:43.831
[Both speaking Swedish]

18:43.997 --> 18:46.241
For ten years I was writing
to your little brother?

18:46.366 --> 18:49.143
Okay, that... that can't be true.
I told him I loved him.

18:49.268 --> 18:50.755
- That doesn't make me...
- It does.

18:50.921 --> 18:53.549
I had you for two years.
And the sleeve!

18:53.715 --> 18:55.634
Unbelievable, I can't believe
mom worked with such idiots.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.319
But she made us promise
we'd show you this video

18:57.444 --> 19:01.724
if she ever prematurely passed away.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.292

19:15.654 --> 19:17.973
Jillian, you were always there
to listen.

19:18.098 --> 19:19.975
I don't think we ever spoke.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.578
Montez, thank you
for letting me borrow

19:22.703 --> 19:27.083
your <i>Wayne's World</i> DVD.
Sha-wing!

19:28.667 --> 19:30.628
And bill, I had the baby.
She's in Phoenix.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.255
- Phoenix!
- And finally,

19:33.421 --> 19:36.175
- Anders, Blake, and Alan...
- Alan?

19:36.341 --> 19:39.553
The other office pranksters.

19:39.719 --> 19:42.297
I wanted to show you a painting
I made for your cubicle.

19:42.422 --> 19:45.559
I'm so proud of it, and I hope
that it brightens your day.

19:45.725 --> 19:47.353
- She was a painter?
- I don't know.

19:47.519 --> 19:52.406
It's right over here.

19:52.531 --> 19:54.341

[All yelling, muttering]

19:54.609 --> 19:56.278
Can't unsee this!

I'm the main office prankster
for life, you motherfuckers.

20:00.448 --> 20:02.183
This doesn't affect me.
I've seen a lot of porno,

20:02.308 --> 20:04.218
- this doesn't affect me.
- Still got it.

20:04.343 --> 20:06.038
- Okay, uh, wow.
- Oh.

20:06.204 --> 20:10.658
I-I guess the tumor had more
effect than we knew, um...

20:10.783 --> 20:13.261
The truth is we hadn't
seen mom in three years.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.863
We had a Thanksgiving where she kept

20:14.988 --> 20:16.365
calling my dog the "n" word.

20:16.490 --> 20:19.343
Oh, we're just real busy.
I teach, so...

20:19.509 --> 20:21.554
We understand, you know.
Parents.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.639
Right?
Everybody?

20:23.805 --> 20:26.743
Yeah, yeah. Turns out your
mom's actually pretty cool.

20:27.017 --> 20:30.479
I think we're all pretty
butthurt that she's dead.

20:30.645 --> 20:34.818
And the fact that she showed
the entire office her titties

20:34.943 --> 20:37.621
proves that she's
the co-main office prankster,

20:37.746 --> 20:39.196
tied with me, obviously.

20:39.362 --> 20:42.092
- Craig, can we, please?
- Yeah, uh, thanks everyone.

20:42.217 --> 20:43.661
You're welcome, Greg.

20:43.950 --> 20:46.203
All right, everybody get back
to work, now, please.

20:46.369 --> 20:47.371
Where's Homegirl?

20:47.537 --> 20:48.831
Oh, jet set, you're next.
