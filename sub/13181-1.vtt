00:36.569 --> 00:42.735
I won't let anyone come
between us anymore...

00:48.481 --> 00:54.351
I won't let anyone come
between us anymore...

00:59.726 --> 01:05.426
I won't let anyone come
between us anymore...

01:07.667 --> 01:09.362
Are they recording?

03:12.058 --> 03:13.491
Help!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.439
Cigarette.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.779
Light.

03:41.254 --> 03:44.121
I don't believe the dream
I just had.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.722
I was in a forest
running barefoot.

03:46.826 --> 03:49.624
I was hurt, and I was being followed
by somebody.

03:49.762 --> 03:53.425
The more I ran
the more I felt him coming closer.
Who was the guy stalking you?

03:53.533 --> 03:56.730
It wasn't a guy. It was me.
That's the weirdest part.
It was me running after me.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.964
Can't you have normal dreams
like everyone else?
No.

04:01.608 --> 04:04.236
Being like everyone else
is an awful bore!

04:04.844 --> 04:07.438
We should not gone out last night.
I'm exhausted.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.745
Take a rest.
I'll wake you when we get there.
Yeah, very funny!

04:10.817 --> 04:12.751
I'll drive, if you like.

04:12.819 --> 04:16.185
Y'mean like last time?
Oh come on.
It was late, and I felt tired.

04:16.356 --> 04:19.052
Felt tired, huh?
You were dead drunk!

04:19.158 --> 04:23.117
Well, it was your fault for dumping
me for three hours and
disappearing with God knows who!

04:25.932 --> 04:29.732
I hope at least that
he was worth it.
I'll say! Unbelievable!

04:30.236 --> 04:31.760
You're really a bitch.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.495
Bastard!
Maneater!

04:33.640 --> 04:34.607
Bad lay!
Anybody's!

04:34.741 --> 04:36.572
Cheap hooker!

04:39.412 --> 04:41.744
Are there any cool places
to go in the country?

04:41.848 --> 04:44.043
Well, there's a town hall
but that's about it.

04:44.150 --> 04:47.244
Wow, if I had to live here
all year round
I think I'd shoot myself.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.984
It's another kind of rhythm.
It's different.

04:50.089 --> 04:53.684
Besides, we didn't come here
to go partying. We're here to study.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.924
Hey, we're not deaf!
Chill out Marie!

05:41.607 --> 05:45.043
C'mon Hendrix, run!
Bang! Bang! Bang!

05:52.318 --> 05:56.345
Tom, stop shouting for a minute.
You're giving me a headache!

05:56.422 --> 05:58.257
How long do we have to
wait for Alex, huh?

05:58.257 --> 06:00.384
She'll be here after
you've had your bath.

06:00.460 --> 06:04.191
No, because Alex has never seen
this cowboy suit.

06:04.697 --> 06:08.292
Tom, go and have your bath
and then you can put your cowboy suit
back on again. Okay?

06:08.468 --> 06:13.371
Bang, bang, bang!
Come on, Hendrix, bang, bang!

06:15.708 --> 06:19.371
Good... more... more...

07:13.866 --> 07:15.458
Watch the road!

07:15.601 --> 07:18.069
You've still got
some makeup on, y'know.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.448
Are you sure it's this way?
Of course I'm sure.

07:28.448 --> 07:32.908
In fifty meters, you go right
at the corn field
There it is. Turn right

07:33.052 --> 07:35.282
and then go straight
for four kilometers.

07:35.955 --> 07:36.944
You really know
your way around.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.651
Nobody takes this road
except for tractors.

07:40.159 --> 07:42.787
Four kilometers of this
and it's good-by car.

07:46.566 --> 07:49.296
You can't act that way
whenever a guy tries to talk to you.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.993
I don't act that way with everyone.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.503
Come off it, Marie.
It's always the same story.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.307
Stop!
What's wrong?

07:58.578 --> 08:00.876
I saw someone!

08:01.280 --> 08:04.875
Hey, that's not funny, Alex!
No, I'm not kidding.
I saw someone. I swear.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.882
Stop screwing around like that
will you!

08:12.658 --> 08:14.853
Alex, come back here, please!

08:26.873 --> 08:28.534
Damn it!

08:30.610 --> 08:32.441
Alex!

08:36.249 --> 08:38.479
If this is a joke
I'll make you regret it!

08:39.852 --> 08:41.615
Alex, where are you?

08:50.129 --> 08:51.994
Where are you?

08:55.768 --> 08:57.463
I'll get you.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.237
If you think you're being funny
you've got another think coming!

09:16.489 --> 09:17.786
Alex?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.783
Alex!

09:27.934 --> 09:31.734
Stop, you bitch, and come back!

09:34.006 --> 09:37.032
I'm sick of your little game!
Enough is enough!

09:38.377 --> 09:41.346
God damn you!
What if I had left you out here?

09:41.847 --> 09:43.610
Yeah, very funny!

09:44.050 --> 09:46.314
You scared the hell out of me!

10:02.401 --> 10:03.595
Here we are.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.107
Okay, now I know why you
passed your exams so easily.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.309
If you spend all weekends up here,
there's not much else
to do except study!

10:16.816 --> 10:19.785
Y'can't beat it for peace and quiet.
You can hear the train go by
but that's it.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.026
Easy Hendrix, easy.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.754
How are you?
Hello dad.

10:33.499 --> 10:34.867
Don't worry. He doesn't bite.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.698
You talking about me or the dog?

10:36.836 --> 10:38.827
Marie, this is my father. Pop, Marie.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.165
Nice to meet you.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.575
So, I finally see you in person
and not just in a photo.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.475
Photo?
You know, the one I took in Spain.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.610
Yes, it's on the fireplace.
You were living here.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.771
And this is Tom. Hi cowboy.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.679
Hey, are you happy
to see me, partner?
Of course, he's happy.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.051
He has been waiting for you
all this evening.

10:59.258 --> 11:01.594
And your mother's been worrying
all day.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.721
It's Okay.
Mom always worries for nothing.

11:04.096 --> 11:05.654
I think she left you something
in the oven.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.596
But I told her we'd manage
and not to bother.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.162
She didn't know if you'd have time
to eat on the way.

11:10.236 --> 11:14.297
That's mom! I'll put Tom Thumb
to bed and show Marie her room.

11:14.473 --> 11:17.306
Right. I'll leave you then.
I have some work to finish.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.172
G'night. Sleep well.
See you tomorrow.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.472
Good night, sir.
Sleep tight.

11:23.983 --> 11:25.814
Did your dad build this place?

11:25.918 --> 11:27.647
It was an old farm that he renovated.

11:27.787 --> 11:30.756
There are lots of them in the region.
Most of them are ruins.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.882
It's a pity. They've lived here
for five years now.

11:34.126 --> 11:35.957
Did they have problems
with the neighbors?

11:36.128 --> 11:37.527
With the local yokels?

11:38.264 --> 11:42.030
At first, they took my folks for
a couple of hippies who came to
make goat cheese, but now it's fine

11:42.134 --> 11:45.661
Well, that's my room.
There. This way now.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.733
My parents' room's on the right.

11:50.576 --> 11:53.977
Tom's room is there.
Yours is upstairs, guest room.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.911
Just two seconds.
I'll put him to bed first.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.492
Alexis, is that you?

12:18.838 --> 12:21.705
That's my mother.
Go on. I'll be right up.

12:25.277 --> 12:26.437
Hi mom.

12:26.545 --> 12:30.242
Is your friend all settled in?
Show her where the blankets are.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.452
If she needs towels
there are clean ones in the closet.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.170
Your own private bathroom.
Great, huh?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.710
The heating's electric.
Should I turn it on?

13:36.882 --> 13:38.543
No, I can do it if I get cold.

13:39.051 --> 13:41.952
Well, what do you think?

13:42.154 --> 13:44.349
It's like a doll's house...
very pretty.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.461
The problem is he's got a girl friend
he doesn't seem to
want to spilt up with.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.300
Why're you so interested then?

14:00.439 --> 14:02.304
Someone who's taken
can't be all that bad.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.500
I'm always suspicious of guys
who are free. Here.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.403
Want some more?
No thanks.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.549
Well, I think it's too easy
to be a womanizer
when you're already taken.

14:10.649 --> 14:12.344
Maybe I'm just trying to
convince myself.

14:17.656 --> 14:19.248
Maybe he doesn't like me at all.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.918
What's his girl friend like?
She's Brazilian.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.756
They've been together three months.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.424
What's he doing with a Brazilian?
Is that his way of getting
cheap thrills?

14:27.600 --> 14:31.263
Anyway, I've gotta get a suntan fast...
and firm up my ass a little too.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.132
You should see the way
she's built!

14:33.305 --> 14:35.273
If you do salsa
I'll go with you.

14:35.674 --> 14:38.199
Don't get them excited or
they'll keep us up all night!

14:39.678 --> 14:42.704
Hey, what about you?
When are you gonna
finally try your luck?

14:43.148 --> 14:44.080
Don't start with that.

14:44.149 --> 14:46.640
You're gonna end up
an old maid, Marie.
I'm not hot to trot like you!

14:46.752 --> 14:48.276
No, you're scared, that's all!

14:48.621 --> 14:49.588
Enough.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.450
I'm gonna have a smoke outside.
How about you?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.526
No, I'm going to bed.
I'm wiped out.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.528
Don't stay up too late.
I'll wake you at nine.

14:57.630 --> 14:58.654
What's the game plan?

14:58.831 --> 15:01.231
We'll start with international law.
Okay?
Okay.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.167
G'night Alex.
Good night.

15:03.269 --> 15:07.729
Hey Alex, I'm glad that
I finally met your family.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.399
C'mon Hendrix. Come on.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.871
G'night, Hendrix.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.349
Okay, I'm coming.

22:02.854 --> 22:05.049
Who can that be?
Hendrix, quiet down.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.624
Who is it?

22:11.263 --> 22:12.491
What do you want?

23:49.294 --> 23:51.819
What's the matter, mommy?
Nothing darling.

23:51.897 --> 23:53.159
Go back to your room, dear.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.066
But what was that noise?
Tom, do as I say right now.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.159
Go on, go back to your room!

24:06.545 --> 24:08.069
Daniel?

24:09.915 --> 24:11.439
Daniel?

30:53.551 --> 30:59.786
Shit, it's the TV plug!
What am I... What am I gonna do?

34:45.683 --> 34:51.882
B, but, why... why? Why?

35:11.943 --> 35:13.467
Jesus!

35:49.680 --> 35:51.511
Alex?

35:53.117 --> 35:54.675
Alex?

35:57.121 --> 35:58.315
Alex?

36:11.435 --> 36:17.533
Wait a second!
It won't come off! Wait!

36:24.015 --> 36:26.950
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

37:24.842 --> 37:26.241
Liaten to me, Alex, listen.

37:26.344 --> 37:28.869
If he wanted to kill you
he'd have done it already.
Right?

37:32.783 --> 37:37.243
Alex, listen to me.
Tell me where I can
find a telephone, huh?

37:37.421 --> 37:39.048
In the kitchen?

37:39.690 --> 37:45.356
In the kitchen? Answer me, Alex!
I need your help!
I can't do anything alone!

37:45.830 --> 37:49.288
I'll be back.
I'll be back, Alex.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.000
I have to see
if someone is in the house.

38:17.061 --> 38:18.653
I don't believe it!

41:35.659 --> 41:37.027
The phone's been cut.

41:37.027 --> 41:40.019
I'm gonna get you out of here!
You'll see.

43:37.715 --> 43:39.512
Not so loud! He'll hear us!

43:49.293 --> 43:51.158
Don't ruin our only chance, please.

43:54.531 --> 43:55.691
Alex.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.679
We're gonna get out of this.
I promise you.

44:08.679 --> 44:11.170
Even if we have to fight it out
we're gonna make it!

44:23.060 --> 44:25.460
The others were alone!
There are TWO of us!

45:31.495 --> 45:32.928
Just a little more...

45:34.398 --> 45:35.831
Alex, I got it open!

46:10.534 --> 46:12.365
We're in a gas station.

46:25.449 --> 46:28.850
This could be our only chance.
The knife.

46:30.988 --> 46:32.580
This is if I don't come back.

47:43.961 --> 47:46.452
Misslt's an emergency!
Call the police!

47:47.764 --> 47:48.958
What?

47:52.269 --> 47:53.327
Miss, wait!

48:03.146 --> 48:04.374
Hey Jimmy.

48:06.917 --> 48:08.976
How are ya?
Fine.

48:11.922 --> 48:13.583
All alone tonight?

48:16.426 --> 48:19.020
Weekends are slow around here.
Yeah, I'm all alone.

48:20.264 --> 48:22.960
So then, everyone took off
and left the shop to you, huh?

48:23.133 --> 48:24.828
Yeah, that's about it.

48:30.207 --> 48:32.801
This place isn't bad for
bringing a girl at night, huh?

48:34.511 --> 48:36.206
Don't tell me you never did it.

48:37.614 --> 48:40.583
My boss wouldn't keep me on
for two minutes
if I brought someone here.

48:45.656 --> 48:47.556
I'll bet.

48:49.593 --> 48:52.426
That you've got ladies stopping here

48:52.696 --> 48:57.963
and ask you for a little service.
You get'em all excited.

48:58.969 --> 49:00.561
Ain't that right, Jimmy?

49:01.672 --> 49:03.867
Well, yeah, I guess so.

49:11.848 --> 49:15.147
What do ya think, Jimmy?
Y'like'em?

49:17.287 --> 49:20.279
Well, they look real good on you.

49:21.224 --> 49:23.317
They protect you?
From what?

49:23.427 --> 49:28.057
From the sun, Jimmy... from the sun.
Yeah, well, they're sunglasses

49:28.932 --> 49:30.763
so they protect your eyes, sure.

49:36.740 --> 49:38.332
What do I owe ya?

49:40.444 --> 49:43.038
It's 28 bucks.
Y'want the glasses?

49:43.246 --> 49:46.083
No, I m not convinced
but what I could use is
some booze

49:46.083 --> 49:49.075
so how about selling me
a bottle of J&B?

50:18.048 --> 50:20.141
I'd rather have a bottle of
Campbell's.

50:23.920 --> 50:27.014
Sure. Actually, I'm not allowed
to sell alcohol at this hour.

50:27.190 --> 50:30.159
You promise not to tell the boss?
I promise.

52:11.895 --> 52:14.329
What were you lookin' at, Jimmy?

52:16.166 --> 52:18.293
What were you lookin' at?

55:56.486 --> 55:58.977
Somebody answer for Christ's sakes!

56:01.725 --> 56:03.556
Answer!
State Police here.

56:03.693 --> 56:06.662
Hello? Hello, police?
Oh I beg of you, help me!

56:07.230 --> 56:09.198
Okay, calm down
and tell me what the problem is.

56:09.299 --> 56:11.631
The Sorals, they have a farm
near Puyanne.

56:11.768 --> 56:13.668
I'm a friend of their daughter
Alexis.

56:13.770 --> 56:16.671
This guy broke in during the night.
He broke in and he murdered everyone!

56:16.773 --> 56:19.571
He took my friend away
in a pickup truck
and I'm really afraid for her.

56:19.676 --> 56:21.010
He just killed the gas station guy.

56:21.010 --> 56:22.312
Gas station?
Yes.

56:22.312 --> 56:23.711
You're in a gas station?

56:23.813 --> 56:25.405
Yes.
Which gas station?

56:31.788 --> 56:33.312
Hold on. I'll have a look.

56:38.395 --> 56:40.420
I don't know what station.
I was in his pickup truck.

56:40.530 --> 56:42.862
All I know is it's a very old pickup
brown, old and rusty.

56:42.966 --> 56:45.059
Did you get
the vehicle's plate number?

56:45.168 --> 56:47.568
How could I get the number?
I told you I was inside the truck!

56:47.670 --> 56:49.638
Do you realize how many pickup trucks
there are on the road?

56:49.739 --> 56:51.707
Without a plate number...
Jesus, an old pickup truck

56:51.808 --> 56:54.936
on a country road at this time
of night shouldn't be that hard
to spot, huh?!

56:55.044 --> 56:58.138
Calm down please, ma'am
and tell me where you are.

56:58.481 --> 57:01.712
Listen, this son of a bitch just
took off with her. If you don't send
someone right now

57:01.818 --> 57:03.285
she'll never make it!

57:03.420 --> 57:05.888
I understand, but we can't help you
if we don't know where you are.

57:05.989 --> 57:10.085
If I burn this damn gas station down
maybe you can locate it, huh?!

57:18.568 --> 57:22.698
The keys... they keys...

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:16.671
Where does the murdering
son of a bitch live?

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.603
Shit!

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.539
Where did he go...

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.105
Why'd ya care so much about Alex?

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:21.617
She turns you on?
She does same to me.
She turns me on too.

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:05.542
The lights are all out.
It looks shut down for the night.
Better have a look.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:16.356
Go around the back, Fred.

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.690
And be careful, huh?
Right, Captain.

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:38.173
Captain, the back door is locked.
We've gotta...

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.545
Y'better call headquarters.

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:49.851
This is patrol car 214 calling.
We've got a murder victim here.

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.000
Oh my God!

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:29.363
It's me, Alex. It's me.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:38.596
It's over.

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:44.109
It's all over.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.379
Okay.

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:30.090
Don't touch me!

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:32.419
Don't touch me I said!

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.253
It's all over. He's dead.

01:15:35.397 --> 01:15:36.999
He's dead. It's over.

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:40.059
You don't make any sense!
Get away!

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:42.329
It's all over, all over.
Back off!

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:45.069
Alex, calm down.
Back off!

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.676
It's over, Alex.
I killed him. He's dead.

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:58.713
Alex, please calm down.
Back off! Don't come closer!

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:03.382
Alex, come. It's all over now.
He can never do anything again.

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:07.157
You mad bitch! I'm gonna cut
your head into pieces!

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:11.289
It's me, Marie, your friend.
I'm on your side!

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:13.867
I killed him, Alex.
It's finished. He's dead.

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:17.405
You murdered my whole family!
You murdered my whole family!

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:20.737
You don't know what you're saying.
There was nothing I could do
to save them.

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.467
There was just you.
You know that.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:26.173
Alex, everything's gonna be okay
from now on.

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:31.309
Please, you've gotta trust me, Alex.

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:09.656
You'll pay for this, you bitch!

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:23.335
I'm gonna take care of you, Alex!

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:32.880
I'm gonna take care of you, Alex!

01:17:56.672 --> 01:18:00.005
Help me! Help! Help me!

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:04.979
Go on! Go! Hurry!

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:06.580
What's going on?
Hurry!

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:10.743
Hurry up! Go go! Go on!

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:15.644
I'll tear your head off!

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:54.474
You wanna drive me crazy
you god damn bitch, huh?

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:57.913
No... No...

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:02.222
Do ya love me?

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:04.883
You don't love me.

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:08.959
Y'don't love me, do ya?

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:23.108
You don't love me.
Yes, yes!

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:33.548
Yes, I love you! Yes
I do love you! I love you!

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:26.332
Nobody'll come between us
ever again, Alex...
Never again...

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:33.341
I won't let anyone come
between us anymore...

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:40.347
I won't let anyone come
between us anymore...

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:49.225
I won't let anyone come
between us anymore...

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:12.346
Are you sure
she can't see me?

01:23:13.305 --> 01:23:19.341
