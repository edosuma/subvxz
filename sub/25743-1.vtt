(Door slamming)

01:20.432 --> 01:21.432
- Help.

01:22.564 --> 01:23.564
Help.

01:28.766 --> 01:30.016
- Almost there!

01:31.353 --> 01:33.686
Are you guys ready to party?

01:39.569 --> 01:40.569
Nope, fine.

01:42.665 --> 01:46.498
(Energetic electronica music)

01:56.273 --> 01:57.273
We're here!

01:59.290 --> 02:02.358
Paxton says that
girl you're looking

02:02.359 --> 02:05.276
for will be there
sometime tonight.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.229
I also made you
guys these watches.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.949
I programmed them myself,
and if you get close to her

02:10.949 --> 02:12.783
then they're gonna
beep and stuff.

02:15.149 --> 02:17.439
(Sighs) This is really my favorite
thing in the world to do,

02:17.440 --> 02:18.979
I really wish we could
do it more often.

02:18.980 --> 02:21.869
Maybe after this we could go
like get pizza and ice cream,

02:21.870 --> 02:24.659
and just, you know, hang out,
because I think you're so cool

02:24.660 --> 02:26.213
and what you do is so cool,

02:26.214 --> 02:27.047
and I really like
pizza and ice cream,

02:27.048 --> 02:28.569
so that's why I think
we should hang

02:28.570 --> 02:29.656
out together more often.

02:29.657 --> 02:31.574
What do you guys think?

02:33.990 --> 02:37.823
(Energetic electronica music)

02:56.690 --> 02:59.523
(Digital beeping)

03:01.940 --> 03:04.349
- Listen, you gotta help me.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.223
Please, I can pay.

03:07.394 --> 03:09.615
- I don't know, Marco,
what do you think?

03:09.616 --> 03:12.309
- She doesn't look like
much protecting to me.

03:12.310 --> 03:14.626
- Please, I can pay
you, all of you.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.429
- All of us?

03:16.430 --> 03:18.609
You do realize it's
10 grand a day each,

03:18.610 --> 03:19.799
and there's four of us.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.800
- Not a problem.

03:23.390 --> 03:26.340
There's enough to cover a week,
that's more than I'll need.

03:28.530 --> 03:30.180
- It's like two
weeks worth, man.

03:31.649 --> 03:34.529
- [Li-hwah] I'd like you
guys to be enthusiastic.

03:34.530 --> 03:37.326
- Don't worry, you
got the best people

03:37.327 --> 03:39.403
in the business working for ya.

03:44.548 --> 03:46.999
- [Marco] So who are we
protecting you from?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.429
- I um, I don't really know.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.410
- You don't know?

03:50.411 --> 03:53.249
No names, descriptions,
pictures, anything?

03:53.250 --> 03:54.083
- No, I, I...

03:54.084 --> 03:55.869
- what the hell you
paying us for, then?

03:55.870 --> 03:59.389
- I don't know, I, I, this
woman, she's not too tall,

03:59.390 --> 04:02.369
blonde, a-and there's
another guy, he's, I dunno.

04:02.370 --> 04:05.202
There's three of them and
they're just really good

04:05.203 --> 04:07.433
at killing people, okay?

04:08.440 --> 04:09.440
They're eyes.

04:10.350 --> 04:11.350
They're eyes.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.050
(Electronic beeping)

04:35.413 --> 04:40.413
That's one of them!

05:49.631 --> 05:52.298

06:00.731 --> 06:01.981

06:03.269 --> 06:06.269
(Suspenseful music)

07:45.295 --> 07:47.962
(Siren blaring)

07:50.120 --> 07:52.759
- [Dr. Howe] In our near
future, over 90% of the world

07:52.760 --> 07:55.813
will lose their vision to an
unknown airborne bacteria.

07:58.210 --> 08:02.069
I was fortunate to make it
to the safe zones in time.

08:02.070 --> 08:05.659
The ones that didn't are
left to fend for themselves

08:05.660 --> 08:08.292
outside of the walls
until the cure is found.

08:08.293 --> 08:09.341
(Crowd yelling)

08:09.342 --> 08:10.619
(Gunshot blasting)

08:10.620 --> 08:14.300
It's been over five years,
and they've grown impatient.

08:15.140 --> 08:17.479
- [Reporter] Ex-special forces
suffered heavy casualties

08:17.480 --> 08:20.569
yesterday from yet another
attack by the insurrectionists

08:20.570 --> 08:22.689
outside the quarantine walls.

08:22.690 --> 08:25.699
Reports state their weapons
are becoming increasingly...

08:25.700 --> 08:26.700
- yes.

08:28.570 --> 08:31.583
I know, I've seen the numbers.

08:34.570 --> 08:36.570
I know we're running
out of time, but...

08:40.740 --> 08:42.340
I'm checking our team right now.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.549
Yes, I know we delegated her
team to another assignment,

08:45.550 --> 08:47.453
but we need all hands on oculus.

08:50.773 --> 08:53.606
(Electronic beep)

08:54.639 --> 08:55.819
(Knocking)

08:55.820 --> 08:57.599
- [Williams] Martinez,
do you have a minute?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.463
- Yes, come in.

09:01.530 --> 09:02.959
And who's this?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.859
- This is Billy,
our new analyst.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.009
Billy, I'd like for
you to meet Martinez,

09:07.010 --> 09:09.349
one of our project
leads here at miraco.

09:09.350 --> 09:10.250
- [Billy] Pleasure to meet you.

09:10.251 --> 09:11.467
- Welcome to miraco.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.219
- So, the board has been
getting on me for updates.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.569
Is your team anywhere
closer to a clinical trial?

09:17.570 --> 09:20.279
- We haven't made any
significant gains in some time.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.130
I'm not sure we'll
beat anyone to it.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.359
- If oculus is not worth pursuing
at the rate we're going,

09:26.360 --> 09:27.769
what else can we do?

09:27.770 --> 09:31.469
- Well from my standpoint, if
we choose to switch gears now

09:31.470 --> 09:33.470
we'll probably end up
pretty far behind.

09:35.460 --> 09:36.599
- Billy, can you
give us a minute?

09:36.600 --> 09:37.600
- Of course.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.116
- Ain't it something?

09:49.117 --> 09:51.699
This company started curing
one of the worst killers

09:51.700 --> 09:54.169
in the world, and
pretty soon there'll

09:54.170 --> 09:56.693
be nothing left to fix
once we're all sterile.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.029
I don't know what's
left for us to do.

10:02.030 --> 10:04.739
May as well start
making baby bottles.

10:04.740 --> 10:05.740
- Maybe we should.

10:08.030 --> 10:09.030
- Yeah.

10:10.430 --> 10:12.803
So, I guess this is it, huh?

10:13.970 --> 10:16.799
Time to hang up the lab
coats and move on.

10:16.800 --> 10:17.979
- Have you thought
about other products

10:17.980 --> 10:19.083
outside of what we do?

10:20.940 --> 10:22.469
- [Williams] You have ideas?

10:22.470 --> 10:23.849
- Well up until now
we've only looked

10:23.850 --> 10:25.519
at fixing the human body.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.019
We really haven't looked
at making it better.

10:28.020 --> 10:31.803
- Oh, so, (chuckles) You want
us to win the next Olympics.

10:33.190 --> 10:35.599
- During the research
for the cancer project

10:35.600 --> 10:37.923
the teams came across
some interesting finds.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.329
I believe we have the
resources at hand

10:41.330 --> 10:43.580
to develop something
useful for the military.

10:45.460 --> 10:47.879
- Are you suggesting
making bioweapons?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.473
- Sort of a biological weapon.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.360
A human weapon.

10:53.670 --> 10:56.319
- I'm really not sure I'm
following you, Martinez.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.649
- We could increase their
strength, their speed,

10:58.650 --> 11:02.379
their stamina, their mental
capacity, you name it.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.849
The world is still
very much in conflict.

11:04.850 --> 11:07.450
We'll be the only ones
exploring it from this angle.

11:08.487 --> 11:10.739
We'd do the impossible again.

11:10.740 --> 11:12.440
It's what will put
us back on top.

11:15.590 --> 11:17.603
- No, no we can't.

11:20.990 --> 11:22.869
There's entirely too many
things that can go wrong,

11:22.870 --> 11:25.653
if we pursue any kind of
development of this magnitude.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.898
- Could be, but I believe
we've already done

11:28.899 --> 11:31.353
more than enough work
to make it a reality.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
Just think about it.

11:36.140 --> 11:38.219
- Who would run your research?

11:38.220 --> 11:39.220
- I think Dr. Howe.

11:40.110 --> 11:42.553
- Dr. Howe, from
schaefer's team?

11:43.473 --> 11:45.609
Why do you think he'd
do something like this?

11:45.610 --> 11:48.809
I mean, no offense, but his
team has already been ahead

11:48.810 --> 11:51.182
of yours for quite
some time now.

11:51.183 --> 11:53.948
- I think if I present it
to him in the right way,

11:53.949 --> 11:55.223
he'll be on board.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.419
- And how certain are you
about what you're suggesting?

12:02.420 --> 12:04.709
- The returns from
this will put us past

12:04.710 --> 12:06.959
all previous expectations.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.763
I know Mr. Sander will
go for such a proposal.

12:13.230 --> 12:16.149
- All right, I'll call for
a company board meeting

12:16.150 --> 12:17.300
at the end of the week.

12:18.260 --> 12:21.523
Present your proposal,
and we'll go from there.

12:51.970 --> 12:52.940
- Well, well, well.

12:52.941 --> 12:54.539
Awfully bold move to have
your friend Williams

12:54.540 --> 12:55.373
call a board meeting for you.

12:55.374 --> 12:56.854
- [Martinez] Out of
the way, shaefer.

13:07.910 --> 13:09.986
- We've been at this oculus
thing for how many years now?

13:09.987 --> 13:11.579
And you think your
team's track record

13:11.580 --> 13:13.209
means a project takes priority?

13:13.210 --> 13:15.259
- Oculus isn't going
anywhere and you know it.

13:15.260 --> 13:18.110
We're no closer to curing it
than we were five years ago.

13:19.850 --> 13:21.679
- I wouldn't expect
someone such as yourself

13:21.680 --> 13:23.199
to understand our potential.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.579
We will cure oculus.

13:24.580 --> 13:25.833
- Let go.

13:31.270 --> 13:34.279
- Ladies and gentlemen,
it's may 18th.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.549
We're here to discuss
a potential project

13:36.550 --> 13:38.400
to help get us out
of this hell hole.

13:39.510 --> 13:41.389
Martinez, when you're ready.

13:41.390 --> 13:45.529
- Thank you Mr. Sander, and
everyone for your time today.

13:45.530 --> 13:48.149
The concept for this new
proposal is to take everything

13:48.150 --> 13:50.529
we've learned from the
cancer research project

13:50.530 --> 13:54.009
and expand its uses
further, beyond medicinal.

13:54.010 --> 13:54.843
- How so?

13:54.844 --> 13:57.269
- The injections that Dr.
Howe engineered allowed

13:57.270 --> 14:00.339
the recipients the ability to
rebuild their genetic code,

14:00.340 --> 14:02.669
with the ability to
fight off cancer.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.417
I believe we can
modify the injections

14:04.418 --> 14:08.689
to let the recipients rebuild
for military purposes.

14:08.690 --> 14:12.228
Simply put, the gun is only
as good as the handler,

14:12.229 --> 14:15.289
and we will be
making the handlers.

14:15.290 --> 14:16.939
- [Mr. Sander] That's a
rather extreme proposal,

14:16.940 --> 14:19.529
outside of what miraco
does, Martinez.

14:19.530 --> 14:22.319
- I know, and with Dr.
Howe's help,

14:22.320 --> 14:25.409
I believe this could work, and
we could save our company.

14:25.410 --> 14:26.689
- [Mr. Sander] Dr.
Howe is working

14:26.690 --> 14:28.849
with this company's best team

14:28.850 --> 14:30.819
on the world's next
big breakthrough.

14:30.820 --> 14:32.889
- But the research and
testing for oculus

14:32.890 --> 14:35.779
have not had any substantial
gain in the last three years.

14:35.780 --> 14:38.639
At this rate miraco has
about two years left

14:38.640 --> 14:40.363
before it runs outta resources.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.359
- It can work.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.523
- [Mr. Sander] What was that?

14:45.430 --> 14:48.803
- Um, Martinez's
proposal, it could work.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.350
- All right then, Dr. Howe.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.119
Tell me why we should throw
away years of research

14:56.120 --> 14:59.483
on this new vision of miraco.

15:00.370 --> 15:04.269
- Her proposal can work,
but we're just gonna have

15:04.270 --> 15:08.253
to forego the standard lab
procedures in order to test it.

15:10.120 --> 15:13.829
- Just forego standard
lab procedures?

15:13.830 --> 15:14.800
- [Dr. Howe] That's correct.

15:14.801 --> 15:16.389
- What makes you think
that that's acceptable

15:16.390 --> 15:20.173
to just overlook such
a critical phase?

15:22.110 --> 15:26.439
- This type of genetic
modification would require

15:26.440 --> 15:28.823
a very specific
type of candidate.

15:30.020 --> 15:33.453
One that we cannot emulate
in standard lab procedures.

15:34.410 --> 15:37.699
The genetic build up, they
would have to be ideal

15:37.700 --> 15:40.169
in order to have a
higher success rate.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.370
- A higher success rate?

15:42.580 --> 15:45.489
So you're saying some
may not even succeed?

15:45.490 --> 15:46.719
- Or live.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.309
- Or live?

15:48.310 --> 15:49.979
Well that just settles
it on this project.

15:49.980 --> 15:52.473
Williams, you have some
balls calling this meeting.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.759
I applaud your cancer research,

15:55.760 --> 15:57.621
but you are way outta
line to suggest we start

15:57.622 --> 16:00.699
a project by testing humans.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.979
We're already in deep
shit with our reputation.

16:02.980 --> 16:06.209
You think people are just gonna
stand in line to be tested?

16:06.210 --> 16:07.880
This meeting's over.

16:07.881 --> 16:10.798
(People murmuring)

16:13.434 --> 16:18.434
- That, that was lovely.
(Chuckles)

16:22.040 --> 16:24.719
- Sir, you know what
this would mean

16:24.720 --> 16:26.572
for miraco if we succeed.

16:26.573 --> 16:28.773
A military contract would
save this company.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.629
- Thought you would have
known better by now.

16:31.630 --> 16:35.233
Seems your old habits die
hard, don't they, captain?

16:41.210 --> 16:42.210
- She's served?

16:43.260 --> 16:45.660
- Martinez served in the
corps under my command,

16:46.540 --> 16:49.059
though she was known to
play her men like pawns.

16:49.060 --> 16:50.060
- What do you mean?

16:51.260 --> 16:52.303
- Sacrifices.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.250
- I can make it work.

17:04.740 --> 17:06.113
I can make it work.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.128
- We'll move forward with
the project no matter

17:15.130 --> 17:16.963
what that old bastard says.

17:18.150 --> 17:19.183
- How, he just said that...

17:19.184 --> 17:20.463
- don't worry about that.

17:25.958 --> 17:28.542
- What will happen
if they find out?

17:28.544 --> 17:29.443
You know, I, I didn't
sign up for this,

17:29.444 --> 17:30.589
this is my career!

17:30.590 --> 17:32.833
- They won't, not
where we're going.

17:33.810 --> 17:35.649
Do we have candidates
from our database

17:35.650 --> 17:37.389
that we can pull from?

17:37.390 --> 17:38.390
- Yes we do.

17:39.536 --> 17:44.536
- Good.

17:51.242 --> 17:53.909
(Alarm beeping)

17:59.495 --> 18:01.019
(Blinds ratcheting)

18:01.020 --> 18:02.859
- [Marie] Come on now, it's
time for you to get up.

18:02.860 --> 18:05.097
- But it's a Saturday.

18:05.098 --> 18:07.629
- That it is, and it's
already past noon.

18:07.630 --> 18:09.069
It's time for you to get up.

18:09.070 --> 18:10.519
I gotta get going.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.843
- But I have nothing
to do today.

18:11.844 --> 18:13.809
- And you would be
wrong about that.

18:13.810 --> 18:16.089
You have to babysit
Bethany today.

18:16.090 --> 18:17.202
- What?

18:17.203 --> 18:18.203
- Yay!

18:19.317 --> 18:21.449
- But mom, I have
stuff to do today.

18:21.450 --> 18:22.519
- Oh really?

18:22.520 --> 18:23.949
Just a minute ago I could
have sworn you said

18:23.950 --> 18:25.821
you had nothing going on today.

18:25.822 --> 18:27.999
- Anna, can we go
to the park today?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.599
- Of course you can, sweetie.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.499
Her mom will be here
to pick her up at six.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.859
Oh, and I left some snack
money for you, too.

18:33.860 --> 18:35.579
I'll see you at home
for dinner, okay?

18:35.580 --> 18:36.939
- Yes, mom.

18:36.940 --> 18:38.209
- That's my girl.

18:38.210 --> 18:39.210
Have fun you two.

18:42.196 --> 18:43.196
- Bye Mrs. Marie.

18:45.273 --> 18:48.023
(Birds chirping)

18:50.678 --> 18:55.010
- Miss Anna, miss Anna.

18:55.011 --> 18:56.192
(Anna moans)

18:56.193 --> 18:57.729
- Anna, Anna, Anna!

18:57.730 --> 18:58.819
- What?

18:58.820 --> 18:59.906
- I wanna go to the park.

18:59.907 --> 19:02.713
- You wanna go to
the park, really?

19:03.823 --> 19:05.746
Do you like monsters?

19:05.747 --> 19:07.209
No?

19:07.210 --> 19:09.386
'Cause I think I'm a monster!

19:09.387 --> 19:10.995
(Playfully roars)

19:10.996 --> 19:13.913
(Gleeful giggling)

19:14.785 --> 19:17.618
(Kids chattering)

19:32.867 --> 19:33.867
- Come on!

19:36.710 --> 19:37.910
- Yeah, just one minute.

19:44.677 --> 19:47.039
- [Miles] You should
arm yourself.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.373
- [Woman] Miles, it's
just a game, I don't,

19:49.374 --> 19:50.207
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

19:50.208 --> 19:51.828
- [Miles] Are you
sure about that?

19:51.829 --> 19:53.076
- [Woman] Yeah.

19:53.077 --> 19:55.513
(Door clicks open)

19:55.514 --> 19:56.347
- [Miles] Finally.

19:56.347 --> 19:57.180
- Mom, what happened?

19:57.181 --> 19:59.749
You said you'd be
home three hours ago.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.949
- I'm sorry honey,
work kept me late.

20:01.950 --> 20:02.969
I'll make dinner right away.

20:02.970 --> 20:05.229
Would you like beef?

20:05.230 --> 20:07.539
Good, 'cause we're
having chicken.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.207
(Laughs loudly)

20:11.077 --> 20:14.077
(Crickets chirping)

20:16.170 --> 20:19.719
So, Bethany's mom said she had
a good time with you today.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.599
She also said you spent
more time on your phone

20:21.600 --> 20:22.839
than playing with her.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.219
- I was still watching her.

20:25.220 --> 20:27.689
- Next time you play with
her a little more, okay?

20:27.690 --> 20:29.489
Little Bethany likes you,
and she looks up to you.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.919
You need to set a good example.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.739
- Yes, mother.

20:33.740 --> 20:35.089
- I don't think it's
asking too much for you

20:35.090 --> 20:37.423
to put your friends on
hold for a few hours.

20:39.060 --> 20:40.409
- Whatever.

20:40.410 --> 20:42.510
- Keep that up and you
won't have a phone!

20:47.668 --> 20:49.918
(Knocking)

20:58.903 --> 21:01.956
(Gunshot cracks)

21:01.957 --> 21:04.624
(Ominous music)

21:13.567 --> 21:15.567
(Gasps)

21:44.455 --> 21:47.788
(Police sirens blaring)

22:10.080 --> 22:12.589
- [Dr. Howe] Test subject
number seven, Caucasian,

22:12.590 --> 22:14.919
female, approximately
16 to 18 years old.

22:14.920 --> 22:15.920
- Who are you?

22:16.953 --> 22:17.940
Where am I?

22:17.941 --> 22:19.959
- [Dr. Howe] Testing
for variant type c,

22:19.960 --> 22:22.390
injection number
five seven seven.

22:22.391 --> 22:23.482
Please restrain her.

22:23.483 --> 22:27.109
(Screams shrilly)

22:27.110 --> 22:29.226
I said restrain her!

22:29.227 --> 22:31.769
- Well she's not moving, is she?

22:31.770 --> 22:34.840
- Yes, but do you understand
that if she's unconscious

22:34.841 --> 22:37.779
it makes my job
that much tougher?

22:37.780 --> 22:41.129
God, I don't have half of the
things that I need around here

22:41.130 --> 22:42.770
to make this experiment work.

22:43.710 --> 22:46.460
(Water dripping)

23:29.755 --> 23:32.755
(Pencil scratching)

23:44.965 --> 23:47.298
(Screaming)

23:55.381 --> 23:56.430
(Gun cocks)

23:56.431 --> 23:58.306
No, we need her alive!

23:58.307 --> 23:59.307
- Fine.

23:59.981 --> 24:02.148
(Screams)

24:03.545 --> 24:05.193
- What have you done to me?

24:05.194 --> 24:08.030
What did you do, you bastard?

24:08.031 --> 24:10.864
(Screams shrilly)

24:46.431 --> 24:47.456
- Seven?

24:47.457 --> 24:50.789
That's a bit more than you
previously stated, isn't it?

24:50.790 --> 24:52.708
Don't tell me you need more.

24:52.709 --> 24:53.709
- I'm not.

24:55.438 --> 24:57.539
The formula is ready for
the prime candidate.

24:57.540 --> 24:59.069
- Prime?

24:59.070 --> 25:00.120
Were these not prime?

25:01.377 --> 25:02.989
- They were close,
close enough for me

25:02.990 --> 25:06.599
to secure the formula, but
just, just not perfect.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.759
- [Martinez] These are
all perfect candidates

25:07.760 --> 25:09.159
we can choose from.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.949
- Yes, the question
is is how many

25:10.950 --> 25:12.450
are gonna take the injections?

25:14.240 --> 25:15.240
- Three.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.003
We'll need three.

25:19.670 --> 25:21.623
If you don't mind,
I'd like to stop by,

25:22.540 --> 25:23.940
have a look at the progress?

25:26.755 --> 25:29.505
(Water dripping)

25:46.633 --> 25:47.633
Jesus.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.029
I thought you said these
were only injections.

25:51.030 --> 25:52.000
- [Dr. Howe] They are.

25:52.001 --> 25:53.459
- Well they look half dead.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.184
- Unfortunately this
is what we have

25:55.185 --> 25:57.109
to do for the injection to take.

25:57.110 --> 25:58.369
- I see.

25:58.370 --> 26:00.470
How long's it been since
their injections?

26:01.442 --> 26:03.519
- About 36 hours.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.059
- [Martinez] Sounds promising.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.660
Let me know if anything changes.

26:14.041 --> 26:16.291
(Coughing)

26:19.660 --> 26:21.361
What's going on?

26:21.362 --> 26:22.419
(Coughing)

26:22.420 --> 26:24.209
- No, it shouldn't
happen like this again.

26:24.210 --> 26:26.084
- What the hell is going on?

26:26.085 --> 26:28.335
(Coughing)

26:32.544 --> 26:34.711
(Yelling)

26:44.231 --> 26:47.481
- It's okay, it's all
right, it's okay.

26:55.403 --> 26:56.403
Please?

27:07.073 --> 27:09.906
(Heavy breathing)

27:14.381 --> 27:17.695
- Boss, boss, you okay?
- What happened?

27:17.696 --> 27:19.696
- I don't, I don't know.

27:23.490 --> 27:24.490
- Are they dead?

27:25.760 --> 27:26.760
Hey!

27:28.730 --> 27:31.829
You need to tell me
what's going on, now.

27:31.830 --> 27:34.780
- I don't know, they were
perfect, this should have worked.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.280
It should've.

27:43.369 --> 27:45.619
(Coughing)

27:49.507 --> 27:50.757
They're stable.

27:52.060 --> 27:53.160
Their wounds are gone.

27:55.137 --> 27:56.137
They did it.

27:58.540 --> 27:59.762
- [Bennet] Boss!

27:59.763 --> 28:03.712
- [Martinez] What the
hell are you doing?

28:03.713 --> 28:05.288
(Hisses)

28:05.289 --> 28:06.289
- Just wait.

28:13.870 --> 28:14.870
See?

28:16.110 --> 28:17.110
She healed.

28:18.380 --> 28:20.403
- [Martinez] Are they gonna
remember any of this?

28:21.364 --> 28:23.714
- Their brains are like
blank slates right now.

28:24.603 --> 28:26.438
They won't remember any of it.

28:26.439 --> 28:29.779
- Good, take care of them.

28:29.780 --> 28:31.130
We'll start them in a week.

28:41.170 --> 28:42.453
- [Johnson] Hello?

28:42.454 --> 28:44.409
- [Martinez] It's been
awhile, sergeant.

28:44.410 --> 28:45.969
- [Johnson] Captain?

28:45.970 --> 28:48.119
Surprised to hear from you.

28:48.120 --> 28:48.960
- [Martinez] I need you in levec

28:48.961 --> 28:50.560
for another training assignment.

28:51.489 --> 28:52.879
- [Johnson] I thought
you retired?

28:52.880 --> 28:53.713
- [Martinez] We're
both coming out

28:53.714 --> 28:55.319
of retirement on this one.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.769
You'll be well compensated.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.288
- [Johnson] Why me?

28:59.289 --> 29:00.529
- [Martinez] Because you're
the only one that made

29:00.530 --> 29:01.953
it out of sector 8 alive.

29:07.690 --> 29:08.690
- Them?

29:09.720 --> 29:11.119
What do you expect me
to do with these guys,

29:11.120 --> 29:12.499
they don't look like much.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.700
- Does it really matter?

29:14.720 --> 29:16.420
You weren't much
when you came in.

29:17.670 --> 29:18.670
- Hey now.

29:19.990 --> 29:21.539
- One month, Johnson.

29:21.540 --> 29:23.569
Make them the best they can be.

29:23.570 --> 29:24.899
- One month?

29:24.900 --> 29:26.238
You gotta be joking.

29:26.239 --> 29:27.072
Captain!

29:27.072 --> 29:27.905
- [Martinez] Get
it done, sergeant.

29:27.906 --> 29:29.077
- [Johnson] Captain!

29:29.078 --> 29:31.625
- [Martinez] Get it done.

29:31.626 --> 29:34.376
(Birds chirping)

29:36.090 --> 29:38.073
- Well then, let's get to it.

29:39.667 --> 29:40.956
- [Dr. Howe] For the next
month it was up to me

29:40.957 --> 29:43.442
to prepare them for the worst.

29:43.443 --> 29:45.069
They weren't much at first,

29:45.070 --> 29:47.679
but that changed after
a couple of days.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.169
Drive, drive, drive!

29:49.170 --> 29:50.627
Hurry up, get a move on!

29:52.670 --> 29:53.933
Light a fire under that ass!

29:58.015 --> 29:59.615
Holy crap, what're you
doing back there?

30:09.539 --> 30:11.789
(Grunting)

30:58.883 --> 31:01.883
(Metallic clicking)

31:03.421 --> 31:06.921
(Rapid gunshots blasting)

31:08.791 --> 31:09.888
Fire.

31:09.889 --> 31:12.889
(Gunshots cracking)

31:23.061 --> 31:25.728
All right guys, go take 10 laps.

31:29.940 --> 31:31.519
Well, you were right.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.599
They are indeed a special group.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.600
- Yes they are.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.099
How's civilian life
been treating you?

31:42.100 --> 31:43.819
- It's all right, I guess.

31:43.820 --> 31:45.627
- You don't sound too sure.

31:45.628 --> 31:48.642
- What can I say, nothing's
quite brought it on like

31:48.643 --> 31:50.333
what we did back in sector 8.

31:51.460 --> 31:53.698
- Why don't you stay
around for a bit?

31:53.699 --> 31:55.449
- What for?

31:55.450 --> 31:57.349
- The patron you deserve.

31:57.350 --> 32:00.553
Stay in levec for awhile,
I've got some work.

32:01.890 --> 32:03.273
I could use your assistance.

32:11.353 --> 32:12.379
- [Dr. Howe] It only
took them two weeks

32:12.380 --> 32:13.783
to become combat ready.

32:14.932 --> 32:17.633
Regardless, we continued
for the full month.

32:18.930 --> 32:22.093
Each day the subjects
became stronger and faster,

32:23.020 --> 32:25.420
even though their bodies
never seemed to change.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.169
They became increasingly
unique from each other

32:29.170 --> 32:33.243
in temperament and skill sets,
possibly a genetic trait.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.339
Despite being such a small team,

32:37.340 --> 32:39.669
sergeant Johnson believes
that they will be capable

32:39.670 --> 32:41.720
of handling larger
missions on their own.

32:43.260 --> 32:47.603
Martinez was right, this project
will save miraco's future.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.143
Well, they're all clear.

32:51.050 --> 32:54.113
Physically and mentally,
they all check out.

32:55.180 --> 32:57.923
So, (sighs) Now what?

33:01.080 --> 33:03.080
- We'll need to field
test them somehow.

33:04.229 --> 33:08.336
- [Dr. Howe] That'd be
the best case scenario.

33:08.337 --> 33:10.779
- Do you think they're
ready to be deployed?

33:10.780 --> 33:12.912
- [Dr. Howe] What do you mean?

33:12.913 --> 33:16.453
- Sending them out on a mission,
do you think they're ready?

33:17.330 --> 33:21.949
- Well, whatever they were
taught by sergeant Johnson,

33:21.950 --> 33:25.429
they should have no problems
replicating that in the field,

33:25.430 --> 33:28.158
so they're ready.

33:28.159 --> 33:30.409
(Knocking)

33:31.632 --> 33:34.669
- Williams, please, come in.

33:34.670 --> 33:35.799
- Thank you.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.041
Dr. Howe, surprised to see you
on this side of the building.

33:39.042 --> 33:40.496
- Well you know, I, I thought
I would just stop in

33:40.497 --> 33:43.649
and say hello, you know,
we are on the same team.

33:43.650 --> 33:45.743
- Yeah, well, about that.

33:47.270 --> 33:50.139
The board told me today
that your team's resources

33:50.140 --> 33:52.089
will go over to shaefer.

33:52.090 --> 33:55.809
As of next week you'll
be under his direction.

33:55.810 --> 33:57.379
- That's funny, I was
just about to call you

33:57.380 --> 33:59.739
to have you set up another
board meeting for me.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.709
- Another board meeting?

34:01.710 --> 34:03.909
May I ask what you plan
to present this time?

34:03.910 --> 34:05.529
They weren't too happy
about the last one.

34:05.530 --> 34:07.139
- They'll be happy this time.

34:07.140 --> 34:09.290
You're gonna be a rich
man again, Williams.

34:10.648 --> 34:12.779
- Oculus, did we get
a breakthrough?

34:12.780 --> 34:13.976
- We have.

34:13.978 --> 34:14.949
- You have?

34:14.951 --> 34:16.129
- Yes, we have.

34:16.130 --> 34:18.359
We just need one more week
to confirm our results

34:18.360 --> 34:19.909
before we present to the board.

34:20.750 --> 34:23.059
- I can't believe it, we're
going back to the top.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.388
- We're going back to the top.

34:24.389 --> 34:26.929
- (Chuckles) I knew I could
count on your team, Martinez.

34:26.929 --> 34:29.362
I'll go arrange for a
meeting right now.

34:30.659 --> 34:32.929
To the top, to the top.

34:32.929 --> 34:35.099
To the top, to the
top, to the top, ha!

34:35.100 --> 34:36.929
Good work, people!

34:36.929 --> 34:37.929
- Idiot.

34:40.110 --> 34:42.349
- Did your team have a
breakthrough with oculus?

34:42.350 --> 34:44.569
- We're not presenting oculus.

34:44.570 --> 34:45.570
- Wait, what?

34:46.659 --> 34:48.266
- We're not presenting oculus.

34:57.319 --> 34:58.210
- Good morning, Martinez.

34:58.211 --> 34:59.829
- [Martinez] Good
morning, Larry.

34:59.830 --> 35:01.179
Where's Mr. Sander?

35:01.180 --> 35:03.089
- Mr. Sander won't be
joining us this morning,

35:03.090 --> 35:04.749
he's actually on a last
minute conference call

35:04.750 --> 35:08.509
with one of our suppliers, so
I will be the acting chairman

35:08.510 --> 35:09.979
for this presentation today.

35:09.980 --> 35:10.950
- I see.

35:10.951 --> 35:13.359
I look forward to your thoughts
on today's presentation.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.193
- [Larry] Thank you.

35:14.194 --> 35:15.269
- May I begin?

35:15.270 --> 35:16.270
- You may begin.

35:18.209 --> 35:21.042
(Electronic beep)

35:22.601 --> 35:25.351
(Dramatic music)

35:27.479 --> 35:30.562
(Car engine revving)

35:58.939 --> 36:00.970
- Martinez, what
the hell is this?

36:01.837 --> 36:03.799
- What you're about to
see is a demonstration

36:03.800 --> 36:05.729
of what enhanced unit
soldiers working for

36:05.730 --> 36:07.719
the future of miraco.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.349
- [Larry] Martinez, don't
tell me that you...

36:09.350 --> 36:12.429
- I did, and you will not be
disappointed by what you see.

36:12.430 --> 36:14.069
- That's not the point!

36:14.070 --> 36:16.489
You went behind the company's
back and sanctioned this?

36:16.490 --> 36:18.656
You sanctioned your
own experiments?

36:18.657 --> 36:19.869
Go get security.

36:19.870 --> 36:22.969
Martinez, you're fired,
get the hell outta here.

36:22.970 --> 36:25.915
- Spencer, Carlos and Jack are
the first three candidates

36:25.916 --> 36:27.829
to receive the injections.

36:27.830 --> 36:29.919
Today they'll be demonstrating
their effectiveness

36:29.920 --> 36:32.319
by performing a hostage mission.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.659
- [Larry] A hostage mission?

36:33.660 --> 36:36.129
- Their objective is to rescue
a high ranking drug lord

36:36.130 --> 36:37.969
that's been running
levec's territories.

36:37.970 --> 36:39.509
- Martinez, I order
you to end this.

36:39.510 --> 36:42.549
You're not authorized to go
saving any drug lord kingpins.

36:42.550 --> 36:44.249
- It's too late now,
they're in route,

36:44.250 --> 36:47.503
so sit down and enjoy the show.

36:49.836 --> 36:51.109
- [Williams] Do you realize
what you're doing?

36:51.110 --> 36:53.249
- I know perfectly well,
I'm saving this company

36:53.250 --> 36:54.819
no thanks to any of you.

36:54.820 --> 36:57.279
- There'll be people on my
ass if word spreads of this.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.599
- I assure you,
when word spreads

36:58.600 --> 37:00.329
this will be in the
company's favor.

37:00.330 --> 37:02.153
- Martinez, Martinez.

37:05.655 --> 37:07.318
- [Mr. Sander] Oh no, let me go!

37:07.319 --> 37:08.319
Let me go!

37:09.981 --> 37:12.064
(Grunts)

37:17.580 --> 37:20.249
- Target's on location,
we're standing by.

37:20.250 --> 37:21.443
- Hey, who're you?

37:22.980 --> 37:24.580
- [Carlos] Spencer, do you copy?

37:25.630 --> 37:27.159
- [Carl] This is four
three zero to five,

37:27.160 --> 37:29.110
we caught an intruder
at the perimeter.

37:30.558 --> 37:32.780
- [Mercenary] 10-4,
bring them in.

37:37.231 --> 37:39.814
(Gun clicking)

37:42.095 --> 37:43.428
- [Carlos] Wait.

37:48.238 --> 37:51.405
(Man murmurs quietly)

37:57.550 --> 38:00.217
(Guns blasting)

38:05.023 --> 38:07.690
(Motor revving)

38:11.836 --> 38:14.419
(Gun blasting)

38:20.380 --> 38:23.297
(Glass shattering)

38:24.721 --> 38:27.631
(Vehicle exploding)

38:27.632 --> 38:30.506
- What's going on
out there, Carl?

38:30.507 --> 38:33.340
(Digital beeping)

38:35.485 --> 38:37.009
What's going on
down there, Carl?

38:37.010 --> 38:38.010
Talk to me, Carl.

38:40.870 --> 38:41.873
Unit three, come in.

38:44.540 --> 38:46.183
Unit three, what's your status?

38:48.250 --> 38:50.033
All units, report your stats.

38:52.240 --> 38:54.540
What the hell's going on
out there, goddamnit?

38:55.453 --> 38:57.286
- You have someone
we're looking for.

38:57.287 --> 38:59.389
- [Mercenary] Like hell we do.

38:59.390 --> 39:00.390
Who is this?

39:01.624 --> 39:04.041
(Gun blasts)

39:06.490 --> 39:07.799
All right, this is it.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.043
I want this place locked
down now, let's go.

39:19.348 --> 39:21.830
(Heavy breathing)

39:21.831 --> 39:24.914
Looks like someone's
here to save ya.

39:25.911 --> 39:28.744
(Energetic music)

39:46.060 --> 39:48.477
(Gun blasts)

39:49.350 --> 39:51.933
(Bullet pings)

39:53.015 --> 39:55.682
(Guns blasting)

40:32.010 --> 40:33.720
Stop, stop right there!

40:33.721 --> 40:36.138
(Gun cracks)

40:45.600 --> 40:47.263
- [Martinez] How you
doing there, sir?

40:48.749 --> 40:51.360
- [Mr. Sander] You, you bitch!

40:52.950 --> 40:54.707
- I thought you
would be grateful.

40:54.708 --> 40:56.791
- Let me go, you hear me?

41:01.937 --> 41:05.049
(People chattering in surprise)

41:05.050 --> 41:06.050
- What do you think?

41:13.118 --> 41:15.701
(Guns cocking)

41:22.245 --> 41:24.912
(Guns blasting)

41:26.955 --> 41:30.513
- [Computerized voice]
Complete, simulation complete.

41:30.514 --> 41:32.319
Simulation complete. (Chuckles)

41:32.320 --> 41:33.323
- Not bad.

41:34.420 --> 41:38.119
A bit unorthodox, but not bad.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.670
The general will be interested.

41:40.513 --> 41:43.039
- Well, we're ready
to talk when you are.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.640
- [Man] Captain Miller, come in?

41:46.580 --> 41:47.669
- Go ahead.

41:47.670 --> 41:49.579
- [Man] We're picking up
insurrectionist movement.

41:49.580 --> 41:52.489
We believe they're meeting with
their new weapons contact.

41:52.490 --> 41:53.999
- Get the Phoenix team ready.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.609
- [Man] Be advised, sir,
there's not much left

41:55.610 --> 41:57.436
of Phoenix team, and we're
picking up heavy radiation

41:57.437 --> 41:59.103
signatures in that area.

42:00.127 --> 42:01.603
What are your orders?

42:03.363 --> 42:05.053
- Do they play well with others?

42:06.350 --> 42:07.450
We could use the help.

42:10.826 --> 42:11.826
- One second.

42:13.985 --> 42:14.985
Captain?

42:16.675 --> 42:18.743
Yeah, okay.

42:23.820 --> 42:24.820
Gear them up.

42:25.900 --> 42:29.313
- [Woman] Attention, attention,
other teams moving up

42:30.200 --> 42:32.927
have been issued to
senso level one.

42:33.798 --> 42:35.359
Attention, attention...

42:35.360 --> 42:36.549
- what's going on?

42:36.550 --> 42:38.334
- We've all been
assigned to a mission.

42:38.335 --> 42:40.719
- This doesn't seem
like a simulation.

42:40.720 --> 42:41.590
- It's real this time.

42:41.591 --> 42:44.149
There isn't much left
in their armory,

42:44.150 --> 42:46.713
but use what you
can, make it work.

42:49.225 --> 42:51.127
- [Woman] And await
further instructions.

42:51.128 --> 42:54.649
Attention, attention,
other teams moving up...

42:54.650 --> 42:57.815
- it looks like you've been
assigned to an escort mission.

42:57.816 --> 42:58.804
- Great.

42:58.805 --> 43:00.339
- I know this isn't ideal,

43:00.340 --> 43:02.240
but you're gonna have
to do your best.

43:03.709 --> 43:07.241
- [Woman] Has been issued
to senso level one.

43:07.242 --> 43:09.329
Report to your stations...

43:09.330 --> 43:10.639
- listen up.

43:10.640 --> 43:12.539
This is the first time
we'll be attempting

43:12.540 --> 43:14.823
a land operation
outside these walls.

43:15.900 --> 43:19.383
The risks are high, but
we have no choice.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.359
The insurrectionists
are currently in route

43:22.360 --> 43:25.129
to an off-grid location
that has been emanating

43:25.130 --> 43:28.389
radiation signatures for
the past few hours.

43:28.390 --> 43:30.669
We have every reason to
believe that they will use

43:30.670 --> 43:33.619
the weapon to breach
our walls and more.

43:33.620 --> 43:35.679
- But sir, can't we
just send in the pilots

43:35.680 --> 43:36.709
and be done with it?

43:36.710 --> 43:37.779
- That's a negative, corporal,

43:37.780 --> 43:39.389
our flight guidance
systems were damaged

43:39.390 --> 43:41.409
during the innies last assault.

43:41.410 --> 43:43.799
You'll be dropped off
at fob number two

43:43.800 --> 43:45.194
on the eastern wall.

43:45.195 --> 43:49.633
From there you will proceed on
foot to the radiation point.

43:50.700 --> 43:53.789
Let me remind you that
by this point and time

43:53.790 --> 43:55.809
if you are not wearing
your goggles,

43:55.810 --> 43:58.779
you will go blind
within a few seconds.

43:58.780 --> 44:01.499
Your objective is to
neutralize the weapon

44:01.500 --> 44:03.663
and bring one of
them back alive.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.323
We need to know who's
making them tick.

44:08.770 --> 44:12.324
Lieutenant Bennet will be in
command of this operation.

44:12.325 --> 44:16.569
You special science turkeys,
you listen to him, 100%.

44:16.570 --> 44:18.214
Is that understood?

44:18.215 --> 44:19.739
- [All] Yes, sir.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.613
- Very well, get to it.

44:27.457 --> 44:30.124
(Alarm blaring)

44:31.069 --> 44:32.399
- Is she on her way?

44:32.400 --> 44:34.919
- Yes, and she's bringing
the doctor with her

44:34.920 --> 44:36.671
in case you have any questions.

44:36.672 --> 44:37.672
- Very good.

44:39.699 --> 44:42.866
(Propellers whirring)

44:54.630 --> 44:56.499
- Do I have something
on my face?

44:56.500 --> 44:59.083
- Oh, uh, no.

45:00.490 --> 45:01.323
It's just...

45:01.324 --> 45:02.404
- [Spencer] It's just what?

45:04.740 --> 45:08.109
Well, what are you
guys, exactly?

45:08.110 --> 45:09.619
- [Spencer] It's none
of your business.

45:09.620 --> 45:11.129
- Oh come on.

45:11.130 --> 45:13.399
You guys are obviously
not normal.

45:13.400 --> 45:16.109
Not with the way you moved
through that simulation.

45:16.110 --> 45:17.710
- Don't poke the bear, corporal.

45:18.650 --> 45:20.129
- Do you have any idea
how much I've lost

45:20.130 --> 45:21.939
because of those selfish idiots?

45:21.940 --> 45:24.199
We're out there dying trying
to defend these walls,

45:24.200 --> 45:27.369
and then you guys show up
with your special treatment.

45:27.370 --> 45:30.019
You know what, I'm not
gonna ask you again.

45:30.020 --> 45:31.040
Now I said what the...

45:31.041 --> 45:32.374
- that's enough!

45:37.908 --> 45:39.075
You all right?

45:40.656 --> 45:41.656
- Yeah.

45:42.536 --> 45:43.369
Yeah, I'm fine.

45:43.370 --> 45:44.490
- [Carlos] What's your name?

45:45.920 --> 45:46.920
- Mason.

45:48.370 --> 45:49.470
I'm a bomb technician.

45:54.540 --> 45:55.540
- Mason, huh?

45:56.290 --> 45:57.699
Carlos.

45:57.700 --> 46:00.019
That's Spencer, and that's Jack.

46:00.020 --> 46:01.020
- Nice to meet you.

46:02.720 --> 46:04.320
- Sorry to hear about your loss.

46:05.210 --> 46:07.383
Can't lose focus out there,
you're gonna get us killed.

46:09.960 --> 46:13.969
- So, what are you guys, really?

46:13.970 --> 46:16.062
- Couldn't tell ya, exactly.

46:16.063 --> 46:19.012
Not because I don't want to,
we honestly don't know.

46:19.013 --> 46:20.313
- That doesn't bother you?

46:21.239 --> 46:22.439
- [Carlos] Not really, no.

46:22.440 --> 46:23.440
- No?

46:24.350 --> 46:26.605
How does that not bother you?

46:26.606 --> 46:28.769
- Do you question your purpose
in defending those walls?

46:28.770 --> 46:29.603
- No.

46:29.603 --> 46:30.603
- Exactly.

46:31.405 --> 46:33.609
Our purpose is to help
you any way we can.

46:33.610 --> 46:35.129
- [Pilot] Get your
goggles on, boys,

46:35.130 --> 46:36.780
we're nearing the
drop off point.

46:39.330 --> 46:40.930
- All right team, weapons check.

46:44.810 --> 46:46.339
Little lady?

46:46.340 --> 46:47.433
- [Spencer] Four mags.

46:49.330 --> 46:50.330
- Three mags.

46:54.870 --> 46:56.433
- Sir speaks-a-lot?

47:01.530 --> 47:02.530
Asshole.

47:03.270 --> 47:04.399
Tech?

47:04.400 --> 47:07.413
- Two mags, and a
class 2 emp grenade.

47:08.520 --> 47:09.620
- What's that exactly?

47:12.690 --> 47:14.240
- If I have to disarm the bomb,

47:15.920 --> 47:18.089
this will cut out all circuits
within a two mile radius

47:18.090 --> 47:19.393
for about five minutes.

47:21.449 --> 47:25.909
This is our last resort,
so don't touch it.

47:25.910 --> 47:26.910
- Let me be clear.

47:28.016 --> 47:30.099
We're to bring back one
of these innies alive.

47:30.100 --> 47:32.549
So conserve your ammo,
don't spray and pray.

47:32.550 --> 47:33.470
We don't know how
many we're gonna

47:33.471 --> 47:35.319
be contending with out there.

47:35.320 --> 47:38.429
Now for this mission, we'll be
breaking up into two teams.

47:38.430 --> 47:39.430
- Three.

47:41.704 --> 47:46.319
- (Chuckles) Well good
lord almighty, it speaks.

47:46.320 --> 47:47.849
Sure about that, guy?

47:47.850 --> 47:50.338
You don't want a
spot or anything?

47:50.339 --> 47:52.002
- Don't need one.

47:52.003 --> 47:53.836
- Well all right then.

47:55.610 --> 47:58.299
- Little lady, you're with
techy, keep him alive,

47:58.300 --> 47:59.900
Carlos, you're with me at point.

48:00.899 --> 48:02.403
If shit goes tits up well,

48:04.050 --> 48:05.723
we'll be counting on you, gunny.

48:09.040 --> 48:12.023
And still an asshole.

48:30.830 --> 48:32.523
- [Insurrectionist]
Guys are late.

48:33.710 --> 48:37.083
- Sorry, do we really have to
come out all the way up here?

48:39.360 --> 48:41.993
- Yeah, but I guess
it'll be aight.

48:43.770 --> 48:47.663
Here, you guys look like you
could use some of this.

48:54.080 --> 48:56.169
- [Bennet] All right
everybody, stay frosty,

48:56.170 --> 48:58.009
we're near the radiation point.

48:58.010 --> 48:59.969
See anything up there, gunny?

48:59.970 --> 49:02.829
- [Jack] Just arrived at the
vantage point, stand by.

49:02.830 --> 49:04.633
- [Bennet] Yeah all
right, copy that.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.069
- Hold on.

49:07.070 --> 49:09.109
There's three targets
ahead of your position.

49:09.110 --> 49:12.009
One of interest,
about 100 yards out.

49:12.010 --> 49:13.659
- [Bennet] We visual
on our targets,

49:13.660 --> 49:15.759
just keep scanning in
case there are others.

49:15.760 --> 49:16.879
- [Jack] Copy that.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.874
- Tastes good, doesn't it?

49:18.875 --> 49:20.913
(Chuckles) Tonight's
the big day.

49:22.740 --> 49:25.149
Need you both at your very best.

49:25.150 --> 49:26.150
- What's the plan?

49:27.180 --> 49:28.280
- It's simple, really.

49:29.390 --> 49:32.123
Just need you guys to get
up that wall tonight,

49:33.140 --> 49:35.299
set it up and set it off.

49:35.300 --> 49:36.300
- Looks different.

49:38.101 --> 49:39.989
- Eh, it's a little
bomb that we saved

49:39.990 --> 49:41.803
for this special occasion.

49:43.010 --> 49:44.609
Be more than enough
to blow up the wall,

49:44.610 --> 49:46.433
even in a 1/4 mile radius.

49:47.590 --> 49:50.019
- Where's the remote?

49:50.020 --> 49:51.020
- Remote?

49:52.130 --> 49:53.980
You think we have
that type of stuff?

49:54.908 --> 49:56.862
You have to manually
set this puppy off.

49:56.863 --> 49:57.863
- What?

49:59.019 --> 50:02.576
- What, you think things
would be any different?

50:02.577 --> 50:04.469
One of you still must die.

50:04.470 --> 50:05.489
- What kind of bullshit is this,

50:05.490 --> 50:07.259
that wasn't part of the deal.

50:07.260 --> 50:09.439
- [Insurrectionist] Nobody
ever said it wasn't.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.249
- This was supposed to be it.

50:11.250 --> 50:12.289
- Don't...
- This was supposed

50:12.290 --> 50:13.609
to be it for me and my family.

50:13.610 --> 50:15.232
- [Man] Stop it.

50:15.233 --> 50:17.329
- You can't keep doing this
to us, you motherfucker.

50:17.330 --> 50:19.143
- Oh, I believe I can.

50:21.019 --> 50:23.249
(Gunshot blasts)

50:23.250 --> 50:25.543
- [Bennet] Where in the
hell did that come from?

50:28.020 --> 50:29.729
- [Jack] Are you
guys seeing this?

50:29.730 --> 50:31.079
- [Mason] Where did
these guys come from?

50:31.080 --> 50:32.859
That's not, how
is this possible?

50:32.860 --> 50:34.799
- [Bennet] Settle down, techy.
We're fighting blind

50:34.800 --> 50:38.066
unless you can get
them outta that camo.

50:38.067 --> 50:40.899
- She had a family, you
didn't have to kill her.

50:40.900 --> 50:42.855
You made a fucking promise!

50:42.856 --> 50:44.359
- And I plan to
keep that promise

50:44.360 --> 50:46.199
as long as you finish
out the mission.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.200
- Fuck you.

50:49.956 --> 50:52.017
- I think you'll
see things my way.

50:58.460 --> 50:59.460
- The fuck?

51:00.867 --> 51:03.255
- [Mason] How, how, we
gotta get outta here,

51:03.256 --> 51:04.150
we gotta get out...

51:04.150 --> 51:05.150
- shut up.

51:05.980 --> 51:08.383
- What's the matter,
you look surprised.

51:09.440 --> 51:11.069
- How did you?

51:11.070 --> 51:13.220
- (Chuckles) We've had
this for awhile now.

51:14.430 --> 51:15.263
- Why didn't you...

51:15.264 --> 51:16.519
- share it?

51:16.520 --> 51:19.219
Well, that's something
that you don't need

51:19.220 --> 51:20.520
to concern yourself about.

51:21.392 --> 51:24.133
But what you need to concern
yourself about is this mission,

51:27.310 --> 51:29.160
so your families can
live like we do.

51:31.104 --> 51:32.383
Now let's get ready, shall we?

51:36.384 --> 51:37.787
(Electronic beeping)

51:37.788 --> 51:38.621
- What is that?

51:38.622 --> 51:39.779
- Just a timer.

51:39.780 --> 51:41.519
Set it and get out in 20 minutes

51:41.520 --> 51:44.117
and you'll be with your
family in a safe sector.

51:44.118 --> 51:46.793
- That's impossible, it takes
40 minutes just to get there.

51:46.794 --> 51:48.379
- Well I suggest
you start running.

51:48.380 --> 51:49.619
- I need more time.

51:49.620 --> 51:50.453
- [Insurrectionist] What?

51:50.453 --> 51:51.286
- I need more time.

51:51.287 --> 51:53.329
- This is not how it works.

51:53.330 --> 51:55.711
- Okay, I could just stay
here and blow all of us up.

51:55.712 --> 51:58.959
- You could, or I could
easily execute your wife

51:58.960 --> 52:01.479
and two kids while that happens.

52:01.480 --> 52:02.470
- [Spencer] Take the shot, now.

52:02.471 --> 52:04.089
- It's not your
call, little lady.

52:04.090 --> 52:05.253
Everybody stand down.

52:08.620 --> 52:11.726
(Heavy breathing)

52:11.727 --> 52:13.009
- [Spencer] Gimme that.

52:13.010 --> 52:13.843
- [Mason] No, no wait!

52:13.844 --> 52:16.395
(Guns blasting)

52:20.173 --> 52:21.989
(Electronic beeping)

52:21.990 --> 52:24.749
(Grunts)

52:24.750 --> 52:29.303
- If he fails,
proceed to kill all.

52:30.872 --> 52:33.872
(Gunshots blasting)

52:37.030 --> 52:38.366
- [Bennet] What do you think
you're doing, little lady?

52:38.367 --> 52:39.373
Get back here.

52:40.400 --> 52:41.487
- [Spencer] Come on, come on!

52:41.488 --> 52:44.992
(Electronic buzzing)

52:44.993 --> 52:47.993
(Gunshots blasting)

52:51.781 --> 52:54.531
(People roaring)

53:05.519 --> 53:08.399
- [Bennet] Quit your crying
techy, and get up here.

53:08.400 --> 53:10.672
(Grunts)

53:10.673 --> 53:13.673
(Gunshots blasting)

53:32.618 --> 53:33.618
- Shit.

53:41.701 --> 53:44.368
(Intense music)

54:33.770 --> 54:36.421
(Grunting)

54:36.422 --> 54:39.422
(Gunshots blasting)

55:11.624 --> 55:12.624
- Go.

55:19.642 --> 55:23.309
- Hell techy, you got
a cramp, get up here.

55:26.864 --> 55:29.257
Damnit, techy, come on.

55:29.258 --> 55:31.925
(Yells in pain)

55:36.573 --> 55:38.489
Carlos, stay here with him.

55:38.490 --> 55:39.685
Carlos, Carlos?

55:39.686 --> 55:40.686
Goddammit!

56:05.114 --> 56:08.114
(Metallic clanking)

56:14.498 --> 56:17.248
(Dramatic music)

56:42.880 --> 56:45.130
(Grunting)

57:25.506 --> 57:27.673
(Yelling)

57:48.274 --> 57:50.222
- [Bennet] What's going on?

57:50.223 --> 57:52.223
Jack, Jack, is that you?

57:53.786 --> 57:55.917
Spencer, do you copy?

57:55.918 --> 57:57.981
Can anyone hear me?

57:57.982 --> 57:58.815
- [Spencer] Loud and clear.

57:58.816 --> 58:00.312
Looks like the emp wore off.

58:00.313 --> 58:02.396
- [Bennet] Need status
on the target now.

58:02.397 --> 58:04.529
- [Spencer] I'm
still in pursuit.

58:04.530 --> 58:06.349
- [Carlos] We've also
lost contact with Jack.

58:06.350 --> 58:08.589
Someone may have taken him down.

58:08.590 --> 58:10.359
- [Bennet] That cocky
son of a bitch.

58:10.360 --> 58:12.209
He's gonna let that
inny get away.

58:12.210 --> 58:13.043
- [Jack] Standby.

58:13.044 --> 58:15.642
- [Bennet] Oh, you
talking now, asshole?

58:15.643 --> 58:17.809
- [Jack] Which way did he go?

58:17.810 --> 58:20.819
- [Spencer] He's west bound,
2,000 yards from last.

58:20.820 --> 58:22.369
- [Carlos] At that distance
there's not much I can do.

58:22.370 --> 58:23.300
There's too many
trees in the way.

58:23.301 --> 58:25.409
- [Spencer] Well you better
think of something quick,

58:25.410 --> 58:27.419
because at this rate the
blast radius will hit

58:27.420 --> 58:29.120
the walls when the
timer runs out.

58:31.430 --> 58:33.519
- [Jack] You have clear
sight of the target?

58:33.520 --> 58:34.679
- [Spencer] Yes.

58:34.680 --> 58:35.879
- [Jack] Keep him in sight.

58:35.880 --> 58:38.821
Call out your position from
him every couple of seconds.

58:38.822 --> 58:40.625
- [Carlos] Do you want
me to do the same?

58:40.626 --> 58:43.649
- [Jack] Do you have sight
on the target as well?

58:43.650 --> 58:46.319
- [Carlos] Negative,
but I can see Spencer.

58:46.320 --> 58:48.199
- [Jack] Then call out your
position from Spencer.

58:48.200 --> 58:49.235
- [Carlos] Roger that.

58:49.236 --> 58:51.009
- [Spencer] 385, 350.

58:51.010 --> 58:52.792
- Please god don't let
them hit the bomb.

58:52.793 --> 58:55.509
- [Carlos] 1,300
yards, zero degrees.

58:55.510 --> 58:57.509
- [Jack] Move off to
your right, Carlos.

58:57.510 --> 59:00.232
- [Spencer] 370, 335.

59:00.233 --> 59:01.503
- [Carlos] 1,280, 340.

59:02.377 --> 59:04.127
- [Spencer] 360, 335.

59:05.096 --> 59:06.196
- [Carlos] 1,270, 335.

59:07.616 --> 59:10.366
(Gunshot blasts)

59:11.210 --> 59:12.793
- [Spencer] Your
shot was too low.

59:13.791 --> 59:14.791
- Shit.

59:17.160 --> 59:19.729
- [Spencer] 352, 335.

59:19.730 --> 59:21.563
- [Carlos] 1,250, 335.

59:22.620 --> 59:24.931
- [Spencer] 340, 325.

59:24.932 --> 59:26.765
- [Carlos] 1,247, 335.

59:28.884 --> 59:30.634
- [Spencer] 335, 325.

59:32.084 --> 59:33.917
- [Carlos] 1,244, 335.

59:37.114 --> 59:38.864
- [Spencer] 332, 325.

59:41.572 --> 59:43.405
- [Carlos] 1,242, 335.

59:45.760 --> 59:47.510
- [Spencer] 329, 325.

59:48.850 --> 59:50.267
- [Carlos] 1,239.

59:52.866 --> 59:56.433
(Gunshot blasts)

59:56.434 --> 59:59.101
(Intense music)

01:00:20.294 --> 01:00:22.961
(Spencer yells)

01:00:26.118 --> 01:00:28.559
- [Bennet] Did we get him?

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.477
Did we get the bastard?

01:00:32.618 --> 01:00:34.603
What's going on over there?

01:00:34.604 --> 01:00:35.904
Has the bomb been secured?

01:00:38.209 --> 01:00:40.009
Does anybody copy?

01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.459
- [Spencer] Target's
alive, bomb acquired.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:45.579
Looks like the emp fried the
timer, but it's still armed.

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.420
- Very good, guys.

01:00:46.421 --> 01:00:48.724
Jack, go find some intel,
we'll meet ya there.

01:00:48.725 --> 01:00:49.910
- [Jack] Roger that.

01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:50.911
- Let's go.

01:00:51.753 --> 01:00:52.753
Get up.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.347
- Wait, what're you doing?

01:01:02.348 --> 01:01:03.290
- I'll tell you later.

01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:04.123
- Wait, can you see?

01:01:04.123 --> 01:01:05.123
- Shh.

01:01:05.924 --> 01:01:06.757
- Where are you gonna go?

01:01:06.758 --> 01:01:08.229
- He's back there.

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:09.230
- Copy that.

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:24.870
- Here.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.310
- So he's the lucky one
going back with us?

01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:34.889
Fob two, this is Lima,
bravo, beta one requesting

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:38.449
immediate evac, echo,
whiskey, plus one.

01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:39.959
- Roger that, Lima bravo...
- Find anything?

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.305
- No, nothing.

01:01:41.306 --> 01:01:42.649
- What the hell
took you so long,

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:44.709
this bastard almost
got away, hey!

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:48.149
Next time you're getting a
damn spotter, you hear me?

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:49.150
Asshole!

01:01:50.056 --> 01:01:53.139
(Propeller whirring)

01:01:59.676 --> 01:02:00.509
- How could you put
them out there

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:02.070
without consulting
me first, Martinez?

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:06.339
- You said they were ready for
a field test, did you not?

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.889
- I did, but, they were
ready by themselves,

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:10.719
just the three of them.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.739
We never took into account
how they would interact

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.639
with other team members.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.469
- Well doctor, considering they
all came back in one piece,

01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:19.579
I think they did just fine.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.729
- Aren't you a bit
underdressed, sir?

01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:23.661
- You know very
well why that is.

01:02:23.662 --> 01:02:25.709
Come on, captain.

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:28.118
This must bring back some
old memories for you.

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:29.619
- Indeed, it does.

01:02:37.164 --> 01:02:38.539
- You did a good thing, doc.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.090
They're exactly what we needed.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.549
- Lieutenant.

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:45.550
- [Bennet] Yeah?

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.673
- You seem like you wanted
to say something else.

01:02:49.616 --> 01:02:51.216
What exactly happened out there?

01:02:52.973 --> 01:02:56.249
- Well let's just say they
aren't exactly cooperative.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:57.629
- [Dr. Howe] Who,
which one of them?

01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:58.730
I'd like to know this.

01:03:03.201 --> 01:03:05.868
- All of them, doc, all of them.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.900
- You guys wanna stick around?

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.469
Where's Dr. Howe?

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:33.309
- He's checking on the kids,
he'll be with us shortly.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.943
- Shame, he's gonna
miss all the fun.

01:03:40.421 --> 01:03:42.921
(Door creaks)

01:03:49.663 --> 01:03:51.066
(Sighs)

01:03:51.067 --> 01:03:54.150
- You know, back in
the bad old days,

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.359
there used to be
methods for getting

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.013
information outta prisoners.

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:05.373
But I'm in a
generous mood today,

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.623
so I'm gonna ask you nicely.

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:11.620
Who's giving you the weapons?

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.719
Now, now, we know that you
guys aren't out there building

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.666
makeshift, handcrafted
nukes, so please,

01:04:23.667 --> 01:04:25.647
who's giving them to you?

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:40.436
(Grunts)

01:04:40.437 --> 01:04:43.219
You selfish motherfucker,
do you realize that we're

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.720
in here trying to find a
cure for you people, huh?

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:47.547
We're already running
out of resources,

01:04:47.548 --> 01:04:50.209
and you have the
audacity to come up here

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:51.569
and try to destroy our walls?

01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:52.683
You son of a bitch!

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.209
And what'd you think was
gonna happen after that?

01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:59.409
Huh?

01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:03.233
Everybody gets infected,
mission accomplished, asshole.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:05.750
All right.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.450
Who is giving the
weapons to you?

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:12.583
- You all disgust me.

01:05:14.253 --> 01:05:15.749
You're not gonna help
us anyway, right?

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.439
- I'm here to tell
you you're wrong.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.440
- Bullshit!

01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:21.922
You and beufits are
fucking the same.

01:05:21.923 --> 01:05:23.159
You and your goddamned lies!

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.160
- Beufits?

01:05:26.044 --> 01:05:27.943
- What does sector 8
have to do with this?

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.620
- You didn't know?

01:05:31.397 --> 01:05:33.033
Vas was giving us the weapons.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.289
They used us.

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:38.289
They promised as soon
as levec got breached,

01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:40.083
we get in, we'd be safe.

01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:43.000
But that was all a fucking lie.

01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:49.069
Now that we know, both of
you already had the cure.

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.253
- We don't have the cure.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.513
- Yes you do!

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.380
You lied to us.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.059
I saw a girl without
the goggles.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.019
She didn't have the goggles on.

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.546
- What is this inny
talking about?

01:06:03.547 --> 01:06:06.159
- I don't know about the girl,

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.019
but we definitely saw
a supplier out there

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.879
without his goggles on, sir.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.899
- Are you sure?

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.891
- Is he sure, yes he's sure!

01:06:13.892 --> 01:06:16.642
(Gunshot cracks)

01:06:22.338 --> 01:06:23.829
- What the hell did you
bring me in on here?

01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:25.429
- I don't know.

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:26.839
- Looks like the war he resolved

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.859
isn't quite over yet, captain.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.310
No one is to know about this.

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:34.539
(Sighs) If what he says is true
about your special soldiers,

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.519
we don't need to waste
resources letting those innies

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.170
in when we've got
a war to fight.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.013
- Shall I draft up
a contract, then?

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:44.451
- [Dr. Howe] You guys can't tell
anybody about this, got it?

01:06:44.452 --> 01:06:46.952
(Door clicks)

01:06:51.694 --> 01:06:54.944
- We're gonna need
miraco to make more.

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:57.670
A lot more.

01:07:00.466 --> 01:07:04.299
(Energetic electronica music)

01:07:26.531 --> 01:07:29.198
(Keys clicking)

01:07:35.294 --> 01:07:37.627
(Gun cocks)

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.230
(Dramatic music)
