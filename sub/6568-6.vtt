00:17.723 --> 00:20.492
So, incorruptible tribunes
of the free press,

00:20.526 --> 00:22.794
please enjoy
this Finnish breakfast.

00:22.829 --> 00:24.729
As you know, the vice
president recently signed

00:24.764 --> 00:26.731
an historic software
agreement with Finland.

00:26.766 --> 00:28.934
Wasn't her trip to Europe
overshadowed by the song?

00:28.968 --> 00:30.668
You know, the one where
she mocked Europeans?

00:30.702 --> 00:32.302
<i>She wasn't
mocking Europeans.</i>

00:32.337 --> 00:34.137
- I would say the song was jesty.
- <i>Jesty?</i>

00:34.172 --> 00:35.973
But more importantly,
right now the vice president

00:36.007 --> 00:38.208
is meeting with the House
Majority Leader Mary King.

00:38.242 --> 00:39.877
And they are brokering
a debt reduction deal

00:39.911 --> 00:41.879
that's going to avert
a government shutdown.

00:41.913 --> 00:43.581
Selina Meyer's
becoming one of the most

00:43.615 --> 00:46.183
effective American vice
presidents in history.

00:46.217 --> 00:48.985
She was crucial in the freeing
of the Uzbekistan hostages.

00:49.019 --> 00:51.721
- Correct?
- Yes.

00:51.755 --> 00:53.255
The software--

00:53.290 --> 00:56.058
Did she know that one
of the hostages was a spy

00:56.093 --> 00:59.195
endangering the other
three students?

00:59.229 --> 01:00.663
Um...

01:00.698 --> 01:02.398
possibly not quite at the time.

01:02.432 --> 01:04.666
So all this stuff
she's been saying about

01:04.700 --> 01:07.503
being a crucial part of
the military rescue is a lie.

01:07.537 --> 01:09.938
Okay, slow down, Leon.
Is your blood sugar off?

01:09.973 --> 01:12.774
Have a pastry
or some herring, okay?

01:12.809 --> 01:15.010
- Answer the question.
- I don't know what she knew

01:15.044 --> 01:17.045
- or when she knew it, Leon.
- Mike, Mike.

01:17.079 --> 01:20.515
Either she knew
that the student was a spy

01:20.549 --> 01:22.016
and lied when she denied it,

01:22.050 --> 01:24.318
or she didn't know
that he was a spy,

01:24.352 --> 01:27.488
but lied about knowing the
details of the military rescue.

01:27.523 --> 01:29.557
This isn't
"Meyer the Liar" again.

01:29.591 --> 01:30.925
Well, it is now.

01:30.959 --> 01:32.793
This isn't going to be
a cakewalk, Selina.

01:32.828 --> 01:34.528
- Oh.
- This one's the hard bargaining.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.162
Don't you worry.
I know how to haggle.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.731
You betcha.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.233
- How are your boys?
- They're great.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.468
- How's Catherine?
- She's 21.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.504
- That's great.
- Yeah, we're having her party tonight.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.406
- So I'm excited about that.
- Tonight?

01:46.440 --> 01:49.576
Yeah. You know, all you
ever want for these kids

01:49.610 --> 01:51.977
- is to be happy and healthy.
- Right. You bet.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.913
And stay out of
Middle East politics.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.315
So two out of three ain't bad.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.885
I'm amazed you can
laugh about that.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.022
Yes, that's what I do.
I'm laughing about it.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.957
She has that boyfriend.

02:04.991 --> 02:07.358
- You think that's going to actually
lead to a marriage? - Should we get going...

02:07.392 --> 02:09.193
- with this business at hand?
- <i>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</i>

02:09.227 --> 02:10.995
I wonder how
it's going in there.

02:11.030 --> 02:13.431
It's like waiting
for a biopsy result.

02:13.465 --> 02:15.299
Mary's a player.

02:15.333 --> 02:18.502
She did own Brian Earl in
negotiations by pretending to faint.

02:18.537 --> 02:20.838
So after Catherine's birthday party
tonight, you want to grab a bite?

02:20.873 --> 02:22.473
Talk about Helsinki,
strategize a little bit?

02:22.507 --> 02:25.576
- I have a date for tonight.
-  Yeah.

02:25.610 --> 02:27.343
Yeah?

02:27.378 --> 02:29.379
- Who is it?
- Ed.

02:29.413 --> 02:31.247
Ooh, and what does Ed do?

02:31.282 --> 02:32.916
Ed Webster is a fund-raiser
for the party

02:32.951 --> 02:34.551
and he's worked for Selina
for the past five years.

02:34.586 --> 02:37.020
- Sue.
- Cracked under the questioning.

02:37.055 --> 02:39.421
He's one of Selina's guys?

02:39.456 --> 02:41.724
You swore you were only
gonna date outside DC.

02:41.758 --> 02:43.693
He's not in DC.
He works in Boston.

02:43.727 --> 02:46.128
Well, my mom doesn't live in Rome,
but she's still a fucking Catholic.

02:46.162 --> 02:49.531
- Are you getting worked up, Danny?
- Shut the fuck up, Gary.

02:49.566 --> 02:50.633
I'm so happy you're
happy for me, Dan.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.167
Oh, what do you want,
a fucking cake?

02:52.202 --> 02:54.703
Look, I can be happy.
See?

02:54.737 --> 02:57.171
There you go.

02:57.206 --> 02:59.908
The only real cut here
is unemployment insurance.

02:59.942 --> 03:02.611
Mary, POTUS is not
gonna make any cuts

03:02.645 --> 03:04.846
to unemployment insurance
and you know that.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.915
Do I need to explain to you
how haggling works?

03:06.949 --> 03:09.117
How about a 10% cut
to NIH, okay?

03:09.151 --> 03:11.051
- I need 20.
- I can't do those numbers.

03:11.086 --> 03:12.285
That's not gonna work.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.321
- God bless you.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

03:14.355 --> 03:17.858
Then the only obvious solution
is unemployment insurance.

03:17.892 --> 03:21.629
No, I told you. I can't do that.

03:23.431 --> 03:26.366
What are you doing?

03:26.400 --> 03:28.400
What?

03:28.435 --> 03:30.903
You stalling for time?

03:30.938 --> 03:32.371
Let me get you a Kleenex, yeah?

03:32.405 --> 03:34.540
I think it's over. Sneezes
always come in threes.

03:34.574 --> 03:36.509
- Have you ever noticed that?
- Really? Is that so?

03:36.543 --> 03:39.145
Oh, well, that was a fourth.

03:39.179 --> 03:42.048
So maybe I need to tell you about
how counting works, right?

03:42.082 --> 03:44.215
- All right.
<i>- Okay.</i>

03:44.250 --> 03:46.818
- We can raise fees...
- The what?

03:46.853 --> 03:49.121
- ...on Indian Health Services.
- Hmm? You gonna faint?

03:49.155 --> 03:50.856
I'm not--
oh, very funny.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.891
- Do you want water?
- Yes.

03:52.925 --> 03:56.194
I'll get you some water.

03:56.228 --> 03:58.563
- I'm gonna get you water.
- Okay.

03:58.597 --> 04:00.798
- How's it going, ma'am?
- Wow, you're really hardballing her, huh?

04:00.832 --> 04:03.134
No, she's pretending
to cough herself inside out.

04:03.168 --> 04:04.669
Could you get her
some water, please?

04:04.703 --> 04:06.570
I don't know what--

04:06.604 --> 04:10.107
Ooh! Oh, my God!
Mary, are you all right?

04:10.142 --> 04:12.543
I think I'm having
an allergic reaction.

04:12.577 --> 04:14.545
- What are you allergic to?
- Is there cat hair?

04:14.579 --> 04:16.279
- I have cats.
- Oh, Gary has cats.

04:16.313 --> 04:17.747
Wait, Gary, Gary, Gary.
We need the water.

04:17.781 --> 04:20.149
Yeah, there you go.
Is it this mohair?

04:20.184 --> 04:21.951
- It might be the mohair.
- Do you think?

04:21.986 --> 04:23.619
- No, she's been here--
- The nuts? Is it the nuts?

04:23.654 --> 04:25.055
- Did you eat nuts? No?
- Mm-mmm.

04:25.089 --> 04:26.522
- Is it the flowers?
- What?

04:26.557 --> 04:28.591
The ones I got
for Catherine's birthday.

04:28.625 --> 04:30.626
Oh, Christ!
Those fuckers!

04:30.661 --> 04:32.561
- That's it.
- Shit, okay. All right, sorry.

04:32.595 --> 04:34.963
- Oh, God.
- Gary, deflower the room.

04:34.998 --> 04:37.132
There's a sentence I bet you
thought you'd never hear.

04:37.167 --> 04:38.701
I'm not good
for another four hours.

04:38.735 --> 04:40.375
Selina, we've got to take
this up tonight.

04:40.403 --> 04:43.238
Mary, I've got my
daughter's 21st birthday.

04:43.272 --> 04:45.373
- Don't go.
- I can't not go to her--

04:45.408 --> 04:48.642
Would you miss your son's
Civil Union ceremony?

04:48.677 --> 04:50.578
- I did.
- Oh.

04:50.612 --> 04:53.715
Well, then, you have to come to Catherine's.

04:53.749 --> 04:56.818
- We've got to finish this tonight.
- Yes, we do, tonight.

04:56.852 --> 05:00.588
Come. You can bring a plus one.

05:00.622 --> 05:03.724
Stick a coat and tie
on a fucking oxygen tank.

05:03.758 --> 05:05.892
Mike, Leon West
called my line twice.

05:05.927 --> 05:07.728
Did you lose your phone again?

05:07.762 --> 05:10.997
No, Leon's a little skeptical
about the whole spy thing

05:11.032 --> 05:13.734
and some dumbass is
resurrecting Meyer the Liar.

05:13.768 --> 05:16.837
Ugh, just because my last
name rhymes with liar.

05:16.871 --> 05:20.505
How lucky am I that
I'm not Selina Mapist

05:20.540 --> 05:22.174
or Selina Medophile?

05:22.209 --> 05:25.577
I just saw Mary King. Looked like
she's been thrown up by a whale.

05:25.612 --> 05:27.312
Yeah, she had
an allergy attack.

05:27.347 --> 05:29.548
So did you do the deal?
Tell me you did the deal.

05:29.582 --> 05:32.382
I'm gonna finish it tonight. She's
coming to Catherine's birthday party.

05:32.385 --> 05:34.954
Jesus. You know, if we don't
get this done by midnight,

05:34.988 --> 05:37.889
we're all gonna turn into ugly
sisters and get eaten by wolves

05:37.923 --> 05:40.759
or whatever the fuck happens
at the end of that story.

05:40.793 --> 05:43.128
Sonic boom in the room.
Ma'am.

05:43.162 --> 05:44.829
- No.
- Oh, okay.

05:44.864 --> 05:46.265
Well, POTUS wanted me
to come down here

05:46.299 --> 05:48.059
and peep the skinny
on the debt negotiations.

05:48.067 --> 05:50.068
Okay, that's a fire hazard,
so let's just...

05:50.102 --> 05:52.436
Gary, I have been sent here
from the president.

05:52.471 --> 05:56.440
Okay, so the president's already
going through a lot of pressure

05:56.475 --> 05:59.310
about this hostage
lying bullshit.

05:59.344 --> 06:01.044
- He's under pressure?
- Yes.

06:01.079 --> 06:03.514
- I'm under pressure.
- Well, you do have a choice.

06:03.548 --> 06:05.849
You could say you were out of the
loop for the hostage rescue,

06:05.884 --> 06:08.652
which would make you look clueless, or
you could say you were in the loop,

06:08.686 --> 06:10.487
which would make
you look devious.

06:10.521 --> 06:13.189
Either way, just blur
the fuck out of it.

06:13.223 --> 06:15.425
Uh-huh.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.560
- Oh, fuck.
- Ma'am.

06:17.595 --> 06:19.228
Anything that I should--

06:19.263 --> 06:21.564
<i>Amy, Ed Webster</i>
<i>is here to see you.</i>

06:21.599 --> 06:23.732
I think he's nervous.
His voice sounded clammy.

06:23.767 --> 06:26.034
Oh, okay. That's good.
That's good.

06:26.068 --> 06:28.036
<i>Look at you all flustered.</i>

06:28.070 --> 06:29.705
It's good that
you'll have sex soon.

06:29.739 --> 06:32.474
Okay, guys, we need
to prep two press releases

06:32.509 --> 06:35.110
for the end of the Mary King
talks at the party tonight.

06:35.144 --> 06:37.579
Okay, version one--
Selina Meyer

06:37.614 --> 06:40.381
ends fiscal deadlock,
saves America.

06:40.416 --> 06:43.785
Version two-- Mary King
steals peace pipe,

06:43.819 --> 06:45.720
breaks it in half,
shits all over it.

06:45.754 --> 06:47.588
Ma'am, your ex-husband
just called.

06:47.623 --> 06:49.123
He says that he wants
to pick up Catherine.

06:49.157 --> 06:52.560
No, I have a car picking her up already.
I arranged that.

06:52.594 --> 06:55.929
He is such a conniving,
grabby prick.

06:55.963 --> 06:57.364
- Is it typical or what?
<i>- Unbelievable.</i>

06:57.398 --> 07:00.066
- Just wrong.
- I hate him so much.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.235
Sorry, can I ask why?

07:02.269 --> 07:04.170
<i>This'll
explain it perfectly.</i>

07:04.205 --> 07:06.807
Valentine's Day
a couple years ago,

07:06.841 --> 07:09.309
- he gave me a black Porsche...
- Oh.

07:09.344 --> 07:11.644
that he bought with
Catherine's trust fund money.

07:11.678 --> 07:14.647
- Oh. - I mean, he just fluffs ya,
and then he fucks ya.

07:14.681 --> 07:16.449
Yeah.
Well, speaking of...

07:16.483 --> 07:18.451
Oh, yeah,
that's a perfect example.

07:18.485 --> 07:20.918
Here you go.
So, he took me

07:20.953 --> 07:23.588
to Cap d'Antibes for the night.

07:23.622 --> 07:26.858
Yeah, they had
crazy intercourse.

07:28.394 --> 07:30.362
Only after which he told me

07:30.396 --> 07:32.897
that he sold our second home.

07:32.931 --> 07:35.834
Yeah, yeah. He's like a
belly dancer with a hammer.

07:35.868 --> 07:37.234
<i>That would hurt.</i>

07:37.268 --> 07:39.903
You know what?
I'm not worried about Andy

07:39.937 --> 07:42.840
because I'm gonna
completely obliterate him

07:42.874 --> 07:45.809
with my fucking poise
and sophistication.

07:45.844 --> 07:47.711
You know what I mean?

07:47.746 --> 07:49.713
- God, did you hear that?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:49.748 --> 07:51.648
She's calling him Andy
instead of Andrew.

07:51.683 --> 07:53.616
- It's starting.
- What?

07:53.650 --> 07:55.718
Every time Andy's on the scene,

07:55.753 --> 07:57.420
- she gets all...
- Giddy.

07:57.454 --> 08:00.423
She's--
this terrible laugh.

08:00.457 --> 08:03.559
- She's like...
- Yeah, exactly.

08:03.594 --> 08:05.928
- With a...
- Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

08:05.962 --> 08:08.330
- She just said that she hates him.
- She does.

08:08.365 --> 08:10.331
But every time
she gets around him...

08:10.366 --> 08:13.334
It's so weird. It's like
a cat on a hot tin dog.

08:13.369 --> 08:15.370
<i>- Gary.</i>
- Yeah?

08:15.405 --> 08:17.639
- You know my red thing?
- Yeah.

08:17.673 --> 08:20.074
Do you think that
it shows enough skin?

08:20.976 --> 08:22.977
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:23.012 --> 08:25.913
I'm gonna be the sexiest woman
to ever exude fiscal prudence.

08:25.947 --> 08:28.148
And you know what? That's a very
fucking tough look to pull off.

08:28.182 --> 08:30.951
- Don't you think?
- Okay, you can't wear a bra with that one.

08:30.985 --> 08:32.686
Yeah, I know.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.822
- Amy.
- Hey.

08:34.856 --> 08:37.658
- Hey.
- Hey, Ed. How are--

08:37.692 --> 08:39.927
<i>So you all ready
for the party?</i>

08:39.961 --> 08:43.429
Um, fair warning,
I party pretty hard.

08:43.464 --> 08:45.331
You should see me dance.

08:45.365 --> 08:46.525
- I can't be controlled.
- Oh.

08:46.534 --> 08:48.367
- I do a lot of pelvic thrusts.
- Oh.

08:48.402 --> 08:50.102
Just very localized dancing.

08:50.137 --> 08:52.171
Very small orbits.

08:52.205 --> 08:54.106
<i>I've been wrecking parties</i>
<i>since I was 13.</i>

08:54.141 --> 08:56.608
<i>I was like the Hunter S.
Thompson of bar mitzvahs.</i>

08:56.643 --> 08:58.844
Hey, is the vice
president here?

08:58.878 --> 09:00.779
I didn't want it to seem
like I was lurking.

09:00.814 --> 09:02.013
Yeah, yeah.
No, you're not.

09:02.048 --> 09:03.982
She'll be thrilled
to see you again.

09:04.016 --> 09:05.984
Madam Vice President.

09:06.018 --> 09:08.119
Uh... hello?

09:08.154 --> 09:10.355
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.

09:10.389 --> 09:12.324
- Uh...
- Ed.

09:12.358 --> 09:14.358
- You know Ed.
- Yeah.

09:14.392 --> 09:16.828
Oh, yes! Oh, yes, of course.
Oh, no.

09:16.862 --> 09:19.831
We-- we-- we--
we-- we met in...

09:19.865 --> 09:21.999
in Bumfuck, Idaho,
I think it was.

09:22.033 --> 09:24.268
- DC.
- Yes, yes.

09:24.302 --> 09:27.104
That's what I like
to call DC as a joke.

09:27.138 --> 09:29.205
Oh.

09:29.239 --> 09:31.741
- Well...
- Great. Great.

09:31.776 --> 09:33.810
- I'll see you again soon, ma'am.
- <i>Okay.</i>

09:33.845 --> 09:35.579
- We're meeting there, yeah? Okay.
- Right. Bye.

09:35.613 --> 09:38.281
Hey, buddy, don't worry that
she didn't remember you, okay?

09:38.315 --> 09:40.450
It's only 'cause
you're a nonentity.

09:40.485 --> 09:43.152
- Who is he?
- That was-- that's Ed Webster.

09:43.187 --> 09:46.755
He's my date for tonight. He
runs your PAC's Boston office.

09:46.790 --> 09:48.891
- Oh.
- He's really connected.

09:48.925 --> 09:50.392
Lobbyist turned fundraiser.

09:50.426 --> 09:52.795
Not the guy at a bus station
with a bucket, right?

09:52.829 --> 09:55.464
Okay, I am ready
to take on Andrew.

09:55.499 --> 09:59.668
I need my happy pills,
a little bit of joy.

10:01.871 --> 10:04.171
<i>So what do you think?
Do you like it?</i>

10:04.206 --> 10:07.742
- Yeah, it's-- it's unreal, Mom.
- Right?

10:07.776 --> 10:09.911
I mean, don't you think
that you and your friends

10:09.945 --> 10:12.079
would call this whole
thing an epic succeed?

10:12.114 --> 10:13.347
Something like that, yeah.

10:13.382 --> 10:16.817
Ah, there's your dad
doing that thing that he does.

10:16.851 --> 10:18.451
Pleasantly talking
to other people?

10:18.486 --> 10:19.653
You know what he does.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.688
He remembers one little thing
about each person.

10:21.723 --> 10:23.757
Lawrence, nice to see you.
You still running marathons?

10:23.791 --> 10:26.727
- Yes, sir. - Right, surprised
you still got any nipples left.

10:26.761 --> 10:29.830
And Jenny.
Nice to see you.

10:29.864 --> 10:31.698
Remember that one time
when you said

10:31.733 --> 10:35.267
you were way into "Twilight" and I
thought you meant the time of day?

10:35.301 --> 10:39.005
It really is the most
dangerous time for traffic, though.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.740
Please, enjoy yourselves.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.441
- Andrew?
- Mary.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.310
- How are you?
- Wonderful to see you, Congresswoman.

10:45.345 --> 10:49.113
Mom, you've invited the House
Majority Leader to my birthday party?

10:49.148 --> 10:51.049
Yeah, sweetheart,
it's the 100 billion cutoff.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.251
- You've heard about that?
- Of course I've heard about that.

10:53.285 --> 10:56.187
Okay, so we are fixing the
biggest problem facing the world

10:56.221 --> 10:58.156
right here, right now
at your party.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.591
So that's kind of cool,
don't you think?

10:59.625 --> 11:01.426
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.461
I got you a glass of champagne.

11:03.495 --> 11:05.963
Thank you, Rahim.
You drink alcohol?

11:05.997 --> 11:09.132
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, you Iranians are full of surprises.

11:09.167 --> 11:10.601
- Cheers.
- <i>Salâmati.</i>

11:10.635 --> 11:12.469
- What did he just say?
- I don't know.

11:12.503 --> 11:14.237
Some gibberish.
I can't understand him.

11:14.272 --> 11:16.373
Hey, baby, once you've
said hello to everyone,

11:16.407 --> 11:17.875
do you want to go clubbing?

11:17.909 --> 11:20.143
Yeah.
Anywhere but here.

11:20.178 --> 11:22.812
Ben, what are you doing here?

11:22.846 --> 11:24.414
- I spoke to POTUS.
- Yeah?

11:24.449 --> 11:26.816
And he said okay on the cut
to unemployment benefits.

11:26.850 --> 11:28.618
All the other deals are done.

11:28.652 --> 11:32.222
So come on, let's get this tied up
so we can get this party started.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.124
Yeah, I--
what did you do?

11:34.158 --> 11:35.792
You plus 10'd yourself here?

11:35.826 --> 11:38.260
Number crunchers to help
you finish the deal.

11:38.295 --> 11:40.762
- Yeah.
- And one of them is a designated driver

11:40.797 --> 11:43.132
because I am going
to get fucked up.

11:46.002 --> 11:48.270
You look so good,
you're like a work of art.

11:48.305 --> 11:51.140
You make this stuff
look like shit.

11:51.174 --> 11:54.842
Compared to you, that
Monet is a piece of shit.

11:56.845 --> 11:59.180
- Selina, are you ready?
- Give me five minutes.

11:59.215 --> 12:01.116
I just got to go
talk to Andrew, okay?

12:01.150 --> 12:03.985
The ex?
Three minutes.

12:04.019 --> 12:06.554
What, are you negotiating already?
I'll give you four.

12:06.589 --> 12:08.990
- I'll cut her off at three, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

12:09.024 --> 12:11.625
- Hi, Selina.
- Hi, Andrew.

12:11.659 --> 12:14.595
It's nice to see you greeting
everybody here at the party

12:14.629 --> 12:17.531
as if it was your own
fabulous party.

12:17.565 --> 12:19.366
- Are you fucking with me?
- I might be.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.967
All right.

12:21.002 --> 12:23.470
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you very much.

12:23.505 --> 12:25.338
You're very tanned.
What is that?

12:25.372 --> 12:27.540
Grand Cayman. I've been
starting to scuba dive.

12:27.574 --> 12:29.875
- Oh.
- Magical to be down there.

12:29.909 --> 12:32.211
- Uh-huh.
- With the coral and the fish.

12:32.246 --> 12:33.812
Feeling up all the mermaids.

12:33.847 --> 12:35.881
They should cover up if they don't want it.

12:35.915 --> 12:38.184
If they don't want action,
they shouldn't advertise.

12:38.218 --> 12:41.586
- Oh, gosh.
- Our little Catherine.

12:41.621 --> 12:44.456
<i>- She's still cute.</i>
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

12:44.490 --> 12:46.090
Remember that first apartment?

12:46.125 --> 12:48.193
Yeah, I do remember
that apartment.

12:48.227 --> 12:50.328
That was a nice
apartment, actually.

12:50.363 --> 12:52.330
- It was.
- Yeah.

12:52.365 --> 12:56.100
What are you doing?
Are you gonna propose?

12:56.135 --> 12:58.702
What would your answer be?

12:58.736 --> 13:02.072
My answer would
be Jesus fucking Christ.

13:02.106 --> 13:05.643
Uh, ma'am. Mary King is very
anxious to speak with you.

13:05.677 --> 13:07.311
- Oh, right. Right.
- At Catherine's birthday?

13:07.345 --> 13:09.213
Well, I'm trying to keep the
government from shutting down.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.582
- Well, get on it.
- I'm getting on it.

13:11.616 --> 13:12.949
Yeah, okay.

13:12.984 --> 13:15.818
Did you see that? I had him
in the palm of my hand.

13:15.852 --> 13:19.121
Well, technically, ma'am, he had
the palm of your hand in his hand.

13:19.156 --> 13:21.891
- Oh.
- You need to be really careful, sweetie.

13:21.925 --> 13:25.495
Gary, you just
called me sweetie.

13:25.529 --> 13:27.564
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry.

13:27.598 --> 13:30.999
- That's what I call Dana.
- Did you ever call Dana ma'am?

13:31.033 --> 13:33.068
I did once and it was awful.

13:33.102 --> 13:35.870
If I were drunk right now,
would you kiss me?

13:37.307 --> 13:40.676
- Yeah.
- No, Gary, I'm kidding.

13:40.710 --> 13:43.044
- Right.
- Yeah.

13:45.747 --> 13:47.348
I'm gonna get a drink.

13:47.382 --> 13:49.116
- Mary.
<i>- Okay!</i>

13:49.150 --> 13:51.285
<i>It's time to drop</i>
<i>a party bomb up in here.</i>

13:51.320 --> 13:53.688
Happy 21st birthday, Catherine!

13:55.156 --> 13:58.559
I want to talk to you
about targeted base closings.

13:58.594 --> 14:00.828
Not if it upsets my district.

14:00.862 --> 14:02.429
Something sex my dick trick?

14:02.463 --> 14:05.098
- Did you say dick?
- Sex your dick trick.

14:05.132 --> 14:06.999
I don't understand
what you just said.

14:07.034 --> 14:08.868
It was funny.
We got to get out of here.

14:08.902 --> 14:11.771
- All right. Where?
- I don't know. We'll find someplace.

14:11.805 --> 14:14.173
You know, you look great
in an art gallery

14:14.208 --> 14:16.743
'cause you kind of are
a work of art.

14:16.777 --> 14:20.546
I mean, I know I'd like to
nail you up against a wall.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.781
No, that was knowing.
I was being knowing.

14:22.815 --> 14:25.584
It looks like we're gonna
be able to move

14:25.619 --> 14:27.185
on unemployment.

14:27.220 --> 14:28.887
- Unemployment benefits?
- Yes.

14:28.921 --> 14:30.322
- On the table?
- Yeah.

14:30.357 --> 14:33.824
Okay, I'm authorized to come
down on OSHA from 25 to 17.

14:33.859 --> 14:35.960
No, I need a single digit.

14:35.994 --> 14:37.995
I can't give you a single digit.

14:38.029 --> 14:40.931
We'd have to make it up elsewhere
and you know you can't do that.

14:40.966 --> 14:43.968
And we are gonna make it up elsewhere.
Hang on just a second.

14:44.002 --> 14:47.405
Hey, gals. Gals, you need
to keep it down, okay?

14:47.439 --> 14:49.799
There are other people in here
trying to have a conversation.

14:49.807 --> 14:51.541
But she took
my boyfriend's number!

14:51.576 --> 14:53.176
- Oh, my God.
- He gave it to me!

14:53.210 --> 14:56.280
You haven't given me a number
on unemployment benefits.

14:56.314 --> 14:59.683
- My number's gonna be .4%.
- .4?

14:59.717 --> 15:01.685
- Yeah.
- I can't--

15:01.719 --> 15:03.920
- I can't do this. Let's go.
- No.

15:03.954 --> 15:06.355
I can't do math
with this kind of noise.

15:06.390 --> 15:09.124
- I cannot stand teenage girls.
- <i>Were you ever one?</i>

15:09.159 --> 15:10.760
- <i>Never.</i>
- <i>Me neither.</i>

15:10.794 --> 15:14.730
Amy and Ed work for the VP,

15:14.765 --> 15:17.600
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

15:17.634 --> 15:19.868
- Fuck off, Mike.
- Sure.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.471
Hey, the veep looks
smoking tonight.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.039
I wonder how much vodka
we'd need to have

15:25.073 --> 15:27.375
to have a little
Mrs. Robinson moment.

15:27.410 --> 15:29.477
That is extremely
disrespectful.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.978
What are you talking about?

15:31.013 --> 15:32.747
That's like the highest
compliment you can give somebody.

15:32.782 --> 15:34.482
Oh, by the way,

15:34.517 --> 15:37.451
I love how much you guys being
together is fucking with Dan.

15:37.485 --> 15:40.487
Amy and Dan used to date, FYI.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.623
Yeah, thanks for
the backgrounding, Jonah.

15:42.657 --> 15:44.325
Does that mean you're
back on the market?

15:44.359 --> 15:47.394
I'm sorry, are you hitting
on my date during my date?

15:47.429 --> 15:48.729
Are you on meds?

15:48.763 --> 15:51.298
Yeah, antibiotics.
Just keeping fresh.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.399
I'm not mentally ill

15:53.434 --> 15:55.868
if that's what you're implying.

16:02.676 --> 16:05.378
Uh, hello? Hi.

16:05.412 --> 16:08.414
Hi, everyone.
I just wanted to say

16:08.449 --> 16:11.950
a couple of words
to my awesome daughter.

16:14.687 --> 16:16.955
You know, I wanted
to pause and just say

16:16.989 --> 16:19.958
that I think
at times like these

16:19.992 --> 16:23.228
<i>it is great to see</i>
<i>family and friends</i>

16:23.262 --> 16:25.929
and to hear family and friends.

16:25.964 --> 16:28.298
To be able to talk
and to listen

16:28.333 --> 16:32.202
and to speak and to be heard.

16:32.237 --> 16:35.806
And I think sometimes
we need to just take time.

16:35.841 --> 16:39.610
Not long at all.
I mean, maybe 10 minutes or--

16:39.644 --> 16:43.413
okay, or maybe 15 is also good.

16:43.447 --> 16:48.118
I'm gonna suggest that we have a
little constructive talking time.

16:48.152 --> 16:51.654
So do you have any sort
of chillaxing kind of music?

16:51.689 --> 16:54.524
And then you keep that playing until--

16:54.558 --> 16:57.127
only until-- look at me--
I give you a signal.

16:57.161 --> 16:58.694
- Not before.
- Sure.

16:58.728 --> 17:02.265
Ooh, and happy birthday,

17:02.299 --> 17:04.267
Catherine!

17:08.570 --> 17:13.276
- All right. - If you can give me 1%
on unemployment benefits...

17:13.310 --> 17:16.344
- Yeah.
- I can go 10 on NIH,

17:16.378 --> 17:18.780
eight off
agricultural subsidies.

17:18.814 --> 17:21.181
The baseline is your budget
proposal from last year.

17:21.215 --> 17:23.384
- Right. Okay.
- Okay, those numbers add up?

17:23.417 --> 17:25.219
- I make it 10.
- 12.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.921
12? How'd you get that?

17:26.954 --> 17:28.889
- You're forgetting energy.
- Of course.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.525
Check this out, then.
Do we have a deal?

17:31.559 --> 17:32.893
<i>Okay, yeah, great.</i>

17:32.928 --> 17:34.761
- Yeah, we have a deal.
- Yeah!

17:34.796 --> 17:37.530
- It nearly killed me, but we have a deal.
- Put 'er there.

17:37.564 --> 17:39.232
- Put 'er there.
- Congratulations.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.666
- I can't believe it.
- Isn't that--

17:40.700 --> 17:42.340
I can't believe it, Mary.
That's so great.

17:42.369 --> 17:44.603
It's good. Now I have
to sell it to my caucus

17:44.638 --> 17:46.839
- before I turn into a pumpkin.
- You'll do it.

17:46.873 --> 17:49.508
Yeah.
Oh, God.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.580
Jesus, 21-year-olds
move fast.

17:55.614 --> 17:57.816
Yeah, tell me about it.

17:59.118 --> 18:00.718
You look good, ma'am.

18:00.753 --> 18:03.021
- Oh, thanks, Jonah.
- You look really good.

18:03.056 --> 18:05.723
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:11.163 --> 18:13.097
Have you guys seen this?

18:13.131 --> 18:15.866
"When the cake was cut and the
guests sang 'Happy Birthday, '

18:15.900 --> 18:17.901
the VP was nowhere
to be seen."

18:17.936 --> 18:19.770
They're saying I had
some sort of huge fight

18:19.804 --> 18:23.040
with Andrew and that
our relationship is a sham.

18:23.075 --> 18:25.808
Monsters. It's like first
Princess Diana, now this.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.210
They think that at the
beginning of the night

18:27.244 --> 18:29.980
you and Andrew were playing
it up to the cameras.

18:30.014 --> 18:32.915
And they're using this Meyer
the Liar bullshit again.

18:32.950 --> 18:34.750
Hey, Mike, who dug that up?

18:34.785 --> 18:37.520
I don't know. Probably just
some idiot remembered it

18:37.554 --> 18:39.055
and then all of a sudden
it got traction.

18:39.090 --> 18:40.357
And this is
from "HuffPo."

18:40.391 --> 18:42.257
Randall Howard's
forthcoming book

18:42.292 --> 18:44.973
claims your relationship with Andrew
during the presidential campaign

18:44.995 --> 18:47.997
was a lie invented by you
to mislead voters.

18:48.031 --> 18:49.565
That's a lie, right?

18:49.600 --> 18:51.433
- Yeah.
- I mean, it's true

18:51.468 --> 18:53.936
and it's what happened,
but it's Kent's lie.

18:53.971 --> 18:55.070
- It's not my lie.
- Right.

18:55.105 --> 18:57.606
Meyer the Liar
has huge mo right now.

18:57.640 --> 19:01.109
You know, as people say,
if it rhymes, it chimes.

19:01.143 --> 19:03.344
Who says that?
No one says that.

19:03.379 --> 19:05.480
I'm pretty sure
I heard someone say that.

19:05.515 --> 19:07.155
Well, it's becoming
a narrative right now.

19:07.182 --> 19:10.552
And the narrative is
that you faked it before,

19:10.586 --> 19:11.987
so you must be faking it now.

19:12.021 --> 19:13.754
Oh, great.
Here's Eeyore.

19:13.788 --> 19:15.723
Deal, boom.
Party, boom.

19:15.757 --> 19:17.591
You are the boom boom veep.

19:17.626 --> 19:21.261
Well, Catherine didn't appreciate the
fiscal party crashers last night.

19:21.295 --> 19:22.997
Andy and I have to take her
out to dinner tonight

19:23.031 --> 19:25.132
to make up for the party
last night, so...

19:25.166 --> 19:26.734
Okay, it'll be in public.

19:26.768 --> 19:29.102
So whatever you do, don't
look like you're faking it

19:29.137 --> 19:32.872
because this Meyer the Liar thing is
just an avalanche of shit right now.

19:32.907 --> 19:34.941
Yeah, tell me about it.
And I'm swimming in it

19:34.975 --> 19:36.709
and I'm breathing it in
through my snorkel.

19:36.744 --> 19:38.745
You need to issue
a statement, okay?

19:38.779 --> 19:41.014
- My private life is private.
- Yes.

19:41.048 --> 19:43.482
Besides, Andrew and I,
we get along just fine.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.051
Ironically, Ben,

19:45.085 --> 19:47.586
we actually are getting
along just fine.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.221
That's great.
That's a great fake.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.424
No, it's not a fake.
That's a real thing.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.761
Oh. Well, great.
Say that.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.763
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

19:57.797 --> 19:59.264
<i>That party last night</i>

19:59.298 --> 20:01.199
turned into an economic summit.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.568
But you know what?
Here we are now for you.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.469
- Happy birthday.
- And to you,

20:05.503 --> 20:08.238
a man who swims with sharks.

20:08.273 --> 20:10.207
- Also starting free diving.
- Really? What is that?

20:10.241 --> 20:13.510
Is that when you try and hold your
breath for as long as possible?

20:13.545 --> 20:16.213
Kind of like sitting next to my
mother after Thanksgiving dinner.

20:18.382 --> 20:20.016
Mom, you're doing
your fake laugh again.

20:20.051 --> 20:22.285
- What?
- Come on, this is nice.

20:22.319 --> 20:23.954
I can't tell if it's fake.

20:23.988 --> 20:26.056
You could never tell
if it was fake.

20:26.090 --> 20:27.156
Yes, I could.

20:27.191 --> 20:30.026
Mm-hmm. What are you,
some sort of expert?

20:30.061 --> 20:32.095
In certain areas.

20:32.129 --> 20:34.463
- What is going on right now?
<i>- This is flirting.</i>

20:34.497 --> 20:36.932
Your mother
is an excellent flirt.

20:36.967 --> 20:38.400
You should take flirting notes.

20:38.434 --> 20:39.902
This is not flirting.

20:39.936 --> 20:43.271
This is like as subtle as putting
a nude photo on Facebook.

20:43.306 --> 20:46.174
Do you think Selina would
notice the invisible man

20:46.209 --> 20:49.044
from the Boston PAC office
if I showed up at the office

20:49.079 --> 20:50.645
in a Pac-Man costume?

20:50.679 --> 20:53.114
I know, I'm sorry.

20:53.148 --> 20:55.083
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>why are you sorry?</i>

20:55.117 --> 20:56.618
I don't know.

20:56.652 --> 20:59.721
I heard whining and I assumed
I needed to apologize.

20:59.755 --> 21:02.824
How long have you
not been listening to me?

21:02.858 --> 21:05.526
I just really need to
watch this because Andrew

21:05.560 --> 21:07.094
is like a dormant volcano

21:07.128 --> 21:09.529
and he can just blow
at any second.

21:09.563 --> 21:11.732
I think I'm gonna
have the scallops.

21:11.766 --> 21:13.634
- I think I'm gonna have--
- I know what you're gonna have.

21:13.668 --> 21:16.737
- You are going to have--
- Don't do that.

21:16.771 --> 21:18.238
- Hmm?
- Put your hand down.

21:18.272 --> 21:22.508
I can't stand that
alpha male arrogant thing.

21:22.542 --> 21:23.909
I really can't
stand it, Andrew.

21:23.944 --> 21:25.911
<i>Okay, it's not arrogant.</i>

21:25.946 --> 21:28.080
And fuck you for thinking so.

21:28.115 --> 21:31.083
Forgive me, I was just
anticipating your order.

21:31.118 --> 21:33.719
- Which was?
- Lamb cutlets.

21:33.754 --> 21:35.320
No.

21:35.355 --> 21:36.922
Yeah. I'm sorry
I know you, Selina.

21:36.957 --> 21:38.857
Forgive me. You're not
a big mystery to me.

21:38.891 --> 21:41.926
And I'm very much enjoying
the plastered-on smile,

21:41.961 --> 21:44.428
pretending everything's okay
because people are watching.

21:44.463 --> 21:46.430
Don't be a bastard, Andrew.

21:46.465 --> 21:49.000
You've got to do the same face.

21:49.035 --> 21:51.402
You put it on, too.
There we go.

21:51.436 --> 21:54.639
Okay, well, now this flirting
is a little bit more subtle.

21:54.673 --> 21:56.807
So, Ed.
Eddie.

21:56.841 --> 21:58.876
Who do you know?
Do you know Ray McCaskill?

21:58.910 --> 22:00.978
Yeah, he's a great guy.

22:01.012 --> 22:03.247
We both are really into
'80s buddy comedies,

22:03.282 --> 22:05.316
which is ironically
how we became buddies.

22:05.350 --> 22:06.850
Fuck buddies.

22:06.885 --> 22:08.553
Jonah, why are you here?

22:08.587 --> 22:10.853
You really don't have
anything to do, do you?

22:10.888 --> 22:14.123
- Look, ignore him.
- Ignore who?

22:15.660 --> 22:18.928
Hey, I think that lady right there
just took a photo of Selina.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.263
This one?

22:20.298 --> 22:23.032
I understand that you guys
have a love-hate relationship,

22:23.067 --> 22:25.101
but most people
alternate emotions.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.336
They don't experience them
at the same time.

22:27.370 --> 22:29.037
We've always had
a volatile relationship.

22:29.072 --> 22:30.939
By that you mean
bat shit crazy.

22:30.973 --> 22:33.742
- Passion was always an integral part.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

22:33.776 --> 22:35.844
Yes, there was fights.
Long, hard fights.

22:35.878 --> 22:39.748
Followed by long, hard...

22:39.782 --> 22:41.149
making up, right?

22:41.184 --> 22:43.984
Okay, I feel like you're
actually going to have sex

22:44.019 --> 22:46.954
on this table and that would
truly ruin my birthday.

22:46.988 --> 22:50.625
Catherine, please. Nobody's
having sex on the table.

22:52.194 --> 22:55.563
- I mean, we are sexual beings, of course.
- Oh, my God.

22:55.598 --> 22:57.098
We had sex.
We, you know--

22:57.132 --> 23:00.434
- I mean, great sex.
- Great sex.

23:00.468 --> 23:03.470
Well, I'm going to have
to text my therapist.

23:03.504 --> 23:05.505
What's the whole
not drinking thing?

23:05.540 --> 23:07.307
- I'm a Quaker.
- What?

23:07.342 --> 23:10.009
Bullshit.
No one's a fucking Quaker.

23:10.044 --> 23:12.346
You probably think that staying sober
keeps you on top of your game.

23:12.380 --> 23:15.414
Well, guess what. I work
hard and I play hard, bitch.

23:15.449 --> 23:16.815
That's my credo.

23:16.850 --> 23:20.152
I got that shit tattooed on
my dick with room to spare.

23:20.186 --> 23:22.187
Jonah, you're not even a man.

23:22.222 --> 23:24.490
You're like an early
draft of a man

23:24.524 --> 23:27.627
where they just sketched out
a giant mangled skeleton,

23:27.661 --> 23:29.328
but they didn't have time
to add details

23:29.363 --> 23:30.762
like pigment
or self-respect.

23:30.796 --> 23:33.097
<i>You're Frankenstein's monster</i>

23:33.132 --> 23:36.368
if his monster was made
entirely of dead dicks.

23:37.703 --> 23:39.237
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

23:39.272 --> 23:41.806
Just try not to embarrass
yourselves while I'm gone.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.408
We'll give it a shot.

23:44.510 --> 23:45.910
Nice to see you.

23:45.944 --> 23:47.844
Um, I'm sorry.

23:47.879 --> 23:49.747
- Can I interrupt a second?
- Uh, no.

23:49.781 --> 23:52.483
It just looks like there's a
lot of people who are tweeting

23:52.517 --> 23:55.552
and taking pictures, so you
might want to be gesture-aware.

23:55.587 --> 23:57.788
It's fine. Thank you.
You can go.

24:01.693 --> 24:03.726
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

24:05.629 --> 24:07.397
I want to tell you something.

24:07.431 --> 24:09.766
What?

24:09.800 --> 24:12.368
Um, the head of PR

24:12.403 --> 24:15.004
told me that our company
funded super PACs

24:15.038 --> 24:17.740
on both sides
during the last election.

24:17.775 --> 24:20.642
I just was fluffed

24:20.677 --> 24:22.944
and then I got fucked.

24:22.978 --> 24:26.948
I cannot believe
what you are telling me.

24:26.982 --> 24:29.150
Do you know-- smile.

24:29.185 --> 24:32.721
Smile, you stupid asshole.
Make it bigger.

24:32.755 --> 24:34.622
There you go.

24:34.656 --> 24:38.025
Do you have any idea how the
press is all over me right now?

24:38.059 --> 24:41.128
And how they are gonna run
with the story

24:41.162 --> 24:43.664
about me funding my opponent?

24:43.699 --> 24:46.567
You're a stupid fucking prick.

24:46.601 --> 24:48.569
Right?
You say it.

24:48.603 --> 24:50.070
I'm not gonna say that.

24:50.104 --> 24:52.271
Okay, what happened now?

24:52.306 --> 24:55.442
You guys look like you're going to
stab each other with steak knives.

24:55.476 --> 24:58.211
We're having a fight
and we are smiling

24:58.245 --> 25:01.348
and putting a face on and you
can do that, too. There you go.

25:01.382 --> 25:03.282
Selina, this is just business.

25:03.317 --> 25:05.385
We want to end up
with the winner at the end.

25:05.419 --> 25:08.019
There's nothing personal
about it, I promise.

25:08.054 --> 25:09.388
I didn't even know about it.

25:09.422 --> 25:11.724
Oh, that's utter bullshit.

25:11.758 --> 25:14.192
But you know what?
I'm keeping it together.

25:14.227 --> 25:16.628
I really am.
It's all good.

25:16.663 --> 25:18.997
- We can keep smiling.
- Keep smiling. Yeah.

25:19.031 --> 25:20.833
I think that if you guys
continue to smile,

25:20.867 --> 25:23.101
you're actually gonna get
permanent lockjaw.

25:23.135 --> 25:24.870
She's so funny.

25:24.904 --> 25:27.305
- Isn't she?
- Sarcastic.

25:27.340 --> 25:29.674
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I just had a call from Kent.

25:29.708 --> 25:33.245
Oh, to congratulate me 'cause
I made the deal last night.

25:33.279 --> 25:34.913
- America thanks you.
- You're welcome.

25:34.947 --> 25:36.848
POTUS is going to stall
on that deal.

25:36.883 --> 25:39.416
No, no, no. Why would he want to do that?
That can't be right.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.585
Well, it sounds to me like he
wants a government shutdown

25:41.619 --> 25:44.388
so he can blame it on Congress and
take the heat out of the spy story.

25:44.422 --> 25:46.556
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

25:46.591 --> 25:49.059
Fuck POTUS. Right?
And fuck Kent.

25:49.094 --> 25:50.794
They're just
a bunch of fuckers.

25:50.828 --> 25:52.162
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, no.

25:52.197 --> 25:54.098
Did they just get that?
Me being angry?

25:54.132 --> 25:56.732
- Oh, yeah.
- But I wasn't being angry with you.

25:56.767 --> 25:58.834
I mean, I was angry
with you before,

25:58.869 --> 26:00.836
but I'm not angry with you now.

26:00.871 --> 26:04.240
- I understand that, honey.
- Don't call me honey for starters.

26:04.275 --> 26:05.942
You have to calm down.
You look crazed.

26:05.976 --> 26:08.177
- Can we confiscate that phone, please?
- I wish we could.

26:08.212 --> 26:09.879
- I think it's too late.
- Excuse me.

26:09.914 --> 26:12.781
There's a picture on Twitter and it
looks like you guys are fighting.

26:12.815 --> 26:15.483
- What? From that?
- Yes.

26:15.518 --> 26:18.586
Look at this. Look.
This is not what it is.

26:18.621 --> 26:20.956
I'm pointing to you
because I'm mad about POTUS.

26:20.990 --> 26:23.025
I wasn't saying that I was
angry to you about you.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.559
Okay, Lee, you're just
making it worse.

26:24.593 --> 26:26.228
I'm not making it worse.
They're making it worse.

26:26.262 --> 26:28.396
- <i>Dad, don't do that thing.</i>
- Would you just cut that out?

26:28.430 --> 26:30.364
<i>Everybody sing.</i>

26:30.399 --> 26:33.301
Nope, nope, nope.
We have to go.

26:33.335 --> 26:36.137
- Okay. Okay.
- Blow out your candles, honey.

26:36.171 --> 26:38.272
- What's the point?
- Okay, I'll do it.

26:38.307 --> 26:39.673
- Make a wish.
- There, it's out.

26:39.707 --> 26:41.275
You can make your wish
in the car.

26:41.310 --> 26:43.509
- All right. All right.
- Get all my stuff.

26:43.544 --> 26:45.711
Oh, no, that's fine.
I'll get your stuff.

26:45.746 --> 26:48.214
Okay, happy birthday.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

26:59.192 --> 27:01.327
This is good here.

27:01.361 --> 27:03.162
I'll get out.

27:04.897 --> 27:06.832
