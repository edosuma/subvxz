'Haven't handled many
homicides. None, in fact.'

01:14.161 --> 01:15.814
Frankly, I'm looking
to learn from you.

01:15.901 --> 01:17.381
Not a problem, Deputy Fisher.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.209
Small town.
We don't get much trouble.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.951
- Well, that's a shame.
- It is?

01:22.038 --> 01:23.648
Trouble's your business.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.041
You could say.

01:26.695 --> 01:29.306
'Victim's Alan Foster,
43 years old'

01:29.393 --> 01:31.439
married, no children. Architect.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.005
He bought the house
a few months back

01:33.093 --> 01:35.399
said he was gonna rehab it.

01:35.486 --> 01:36.748
Was the wife
with him last night?

01:36.835 --> 01:38.098
Uh, no, she was in the city.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.490
They have a house
in San Francisco.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.362
I sent a man
to break the news.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.233
Was anybody else
in the house with him?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.801
'Nobody as far as we can tell.
I don't know what to say.'

01:45.888 --> 01:47.803
'The house was locked up tighter
than a drum when I got here.'

01:47.890 --> 01:50.066
Took me half an hour
just to shut off the alarm.

01:50.153 --> 01:51.546
Cho, check
the alarm system.

01:51.633 --> 01:52.764
Either the victim
let somebody in

01:52.851 --> 01:54.636
or they broke
in someplace.

01:54.723 --> 01:57.552
It's a shame.
Foster seemed like a nice guy.

01:57.639 --> 02:00.946
Whoa, that's a lie.
You didn't like him one bit.

02:01.033 --> 02:03.340
- I-I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.429
You thought he was rich,
arrogant, pretentious

02:05.516 --> 02:09.172
an interloper. He wore those
trendy architect's glasses.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.306
[chuckles]
Did you kill him?

02:12.393 --> 02:13.350
- Did I..
- 'Hmm?'

02:13.437 --> 02:16.136
- Hmm?
- 'No.'

02:18.181 --> 02:19.400
No.

[instrumental music]

02:22.446 --> 02:24.187
What kind of question is that?

02:27.843 --> 02:29.018
[sighs]

02:32.195 --> 02:34.589
He's got something in his hand.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.721
- Jane, gloves.
- Right.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.297
[Lisbon]
'A brass button
with the letter B?'

02:49.038 --> 02:52.302
That mean something
to you, deputy?

02:52.389 --> 02:53.303
No.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.177
What's this guy's problem?

02:57.264 --> 02:59.179
That would take way
too long to answer.

03:01.572 --> 03:02.878
Let's take a look inside.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.401
Okay. It's this way.

03:05.359 --> 03:08.188
[music continues]

03:17.327 --> 03:20.243
Clear signs of struggle
rules out suicide.

03:20.330 --> 03:23.203
That, and suicides usually open
the window before they jump.

03:26.815 --> 03:28.556
What's troubling you, Fisher?

03:28.643 --> 03:29.818
What? Nothing.
What are you talking about?

03:29.905 --> 03:31.385
That button made
your pupils dilate.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.517
Now you've gone pale.

03:33.604 --> 03:35.476
What's up, Fisher?
What's troubling you?

03:37.565 --> 03:40.829
Well, it occurred
to me that the button

03:40.916 --> 03:42.352
could stand for Beckworth

03:42.439 --> 03:44.528
'and I got a little
chill, that's all.'

03:44.615 --> 03:47.183
- Who's Beckworth?
- Walter Beckworth.

03:47.270 --> 03:50.230
He was the original owner
of this house, built it.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.841
Died 80 something years ago.

03:52.928 --> 03:56.061
People say he...
haunts the place.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.280
I've heard the stories
since I was a kid

03:57.367 --> 03:59.630
but nobody believes them.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.153
Right.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.981
Guy from the security
company ran the alarm history.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.374
It's been armed
from six last night

04:04.461 --> 04:06.115
until the deputies
turned it off this morning.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.943
No alarms
or interruptions of service.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.510
As far as I can tell

04:09.597 --> 04:10.815
no one's entered
or left this building

04:10.902 --> 04:12.077
except the victim.

04:12.164 --> 04:13.470
But that's impossible.

04:15.429 --> 04:16.560
Isn't it?

04:18.475 --> 04:19.389
Spooky.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.741
[theme music]

04:32.402 --> 04:33.751
I'm not saying volunteering
is better work than this

04:33.838 --> 04:35.362
but it makes me feel better
at the end of the day.

04:35.449 --> 04:38.365
I see people smiling
because of what I've done.

04:38.452 --> 04:41.237
There's something,
I don't know, joyous in it.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.283
How often do we see
people smile in this job?

04:43.370 --> 04:45.981
Leaving out crazy? Never.
The coroner took Foster's body.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.809
I'm gonna get his wife
and bring her to the office.

04:47.896 --> 04:48.984
Lisbon and Jane
are up on the porch.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.638
Okay, thanks.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.292
She's volunteering
at a homeless kitchen.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.164
- That's cool.
- There's a man there.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.209
I think she's, uh, you know.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.559
Banging a homeless guy?

04:58.646 --> 05:01.562
No! A volunteer.
A chef. And she's not..

05:01.649 --> 05:05.174
I don't know.
Not yet...maybe. I think..

05:05.261 --> 05:07.219
I don't know...no.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.962
Dude, you need counseling.

[Lisbon]
'Somehow the killer
got into the house'

05:20.798 --> 05:22.887
without tripping the alarm
or turning it off.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.889
So the killer didn't come
through the front door.

05:24.976 --> 05:27.065
[Lisbon]
'Probably found some kind
of hole in the system.'

05:27.152 --> 05:28.632
Check the grounds
and inside the house.

05:28.719 --> 05:31.635
- Find out how they got in.
- On it.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.202
Grace, you're
the spiritual sort.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.465
Do you believe in ghosts?

05:35.552 --> 05:37.206
I believe the spirit
survives death

05:37.293 --> 05:39.513
and a troubled spirit
can make itself known.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.689
Oh, come on. You don't seriously
think there's a ghost here.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.647
Meh. I don't know.

05:45.257 --> 05:46.302
If you see one, let me know.

05:46.389 --> 05:49.131
[instrumental music]

05:53.962 --> 05:55.703
How long had your husband been
staying at Beckworth Mansion

05:55.790 --> 05:57.618
Mrs. Foster?

05:57.705 --> 05:59.097
Off and on for about three weeks

05:59.184 --> 06:00.272
since we closed on it.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.013
Why? It's pretty run-down.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.538
To get a feel for the house
before he worked on it.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.757
He said you should
spend a month in a house

06:06.844 --> 06:09.064
before you thought
about changing it.

06:09.151 --> 06:11.675
He's conscientious that way.

06:11.762 --> 06:14.243
Or was conscientious that way.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.117
We can take a break
if you'd like.

06:19.204 --> 06:21.250
No, no, no. Let's,
let's just get through it.

06:21.337 --> 06:23.992
So you were at home the night
of your husband's murder?

06:24.079 --> 06:25.167
Yes.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.560
We have to ask

06:26.647 --> 06:28.170
is there anyone
who can verify that?

06:28.257 --> 06:30.651
Um, no, I was alone.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.131
Alan had been at
the mansion all week.

06:33.218 --> 06:36.047
Was it common for you and your
husband to be apart that long?

06:36.134 --> 06:39.137
It was not uncommon
when he started a project.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.488
He...got immersed.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.533
Who might have wanted
to hurt your husband?

06:43.620 --> 06:46.362
Oh, I can tell you
who was angry with him.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.582
- Victoria Abner.
- Who's she?

06:48.669 --> 06:51.062
She's this hippie-dippie
woman who lives in town

06:51.149 --> 06:54.370
and she weaves linens and rugs.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.633
She used to own Beckworth.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.462
She's a descendant
of the man who built it.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.769
And she resented your
husband for buying the place?

07:01.856 --> 07:03.510
But not at first.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.555
There were tax issues
that came with the property

07:05.642 --> 07:07.383
so we thought she'd
be glad to be rid of it.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.820
But...about a week
after we closed

07:09.907 --> 07:13.433
she just blew up, claimed
that Alan stole the house.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.391
It was vicious.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.175
Did she ever
threaten your husband?

07:17.262 --> 07:19.743
[Mrs. Foster]
'She sent some
pretty scary e-mails.'

07:19.830 --> 07:20.875
[knocking on glass]

07:23.660 --> 07:24.574
Excuse me.

07:30.319 --> 07:31.276
What?

07:31.363 --> 07:32.364
Walter Beckworth
was killed

07:32.452 --> 07:33.670
in 1928.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.106
Fight over a woman.
You know how?

07:35.193 --> 07:36.499
No, and I don't care.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.807
He was thrown out of
the exact same window

07:39.894 --> 07:42.984
that Alan Foster was
thrown out of. Coincidence?

07:43.071 --> 07:44.942
- Yes.
- Yeah. Well, it's all here.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.641
- Is that, uh, Foster's widow?
- Mm-hmm.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.251
I need to talk to her.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.819
Mrs. Foster, Patrick Jane.

07:51.906 --> 07:55.518
Did your husband see or hear
anything odd at the mansion

07:55.605 --> 07:58.739
strange sightings,
unusual noises, apparitions?

07:58.826 --> 08:02.264
As a matter of fact, Alan did
mention some strange things.

08:02.351 --> 08:03.308
What kind of things?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.267
Um, in the last week or so

08:05.354 --> 08:08.270
he heard some noises
at night, like groans.

08:08.357 --> 08:11.534
He said sometimes it looked
like things were being moved.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.841
I know it's a little creepy,
but Alan wasn't too bothered.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.233
'He was used to old houses.'

08:16.713 --> 08:18.585
What does this have
to do with how he died?

08:19.803 --> 08:21.152
Victoria Abner
has no arrests

08:21.239 --> 08:22.414
but three years ago
a neighbor took out

08:22.502 --> 08:23.981
a restraining order
against her.

08:24.068 --> 08:26.114
Some argument about
the neighbor's dog.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.159
Victoria got a little
in-your-face about it.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.900
Uh, go and see how
mad she really was

08:29.987 --> 08:30.988
about Foster
buying the mansion.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.294
Okay.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.078
And be sure to ask
about the ghost too.

08:34.165 --> 08:36.167
Do notask about ghosts.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.216
Don't you think I know what
you're doing? No ghosts.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.784
The ghost has something
to do with Foster's death.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.351
No, it doesn't,
because ghosts don't exist.

08:46.438 --> 08:49.616
They don't exist in yourmind,
but if you believe they exist

08:49.703 --> 08:51.922
then...they exist.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.145
[Rigsby]
'Anything?'

08:57.232 --> 08:59.582
No pry marks on any
of the frames so far

08:59.669 --> 09:01.715
no footprints
under the windows.

09:01.802 --> 09:04.108
I don't see any
sign of forced entry.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.675
Maybe itwasa ghost.

09:05.762 --> 09:08.025
Ghosts don't throw
200-pound men out windows.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.374
What do ghosts do?

09:09.461 --> 09:11.246
I have no idea.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.335
Let's just check
the other side.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.605
So you gonna keep volunteering
at the, uh, kitchen?

09:22.692 --> 09:24.781
Oh, yeah.

09:24.868 --> 09:27.262
Making a lot of, uh,
new friends, I expect.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.959
I am, yeah, that's
the great thing

09:29.046 --> 09:30.961
about doing volunteer work.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.920
You meet so many new people
that have the same kind

09:33.007 --> 09:34.835
of values
and interests as you.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.314
Right.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.969
- Hey, look at that.
- What?

09:39.056 --> 09:41.276
The lock on the door, looks new.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.147
Someone cut it open.

09:43.234 --> 09:46.150
[door creaking]

09:46.237 --> 09:49.023
[intense music]

09:49.110 --> 09:51.329
Well, if they haven't started
work on the house yet..

09:59.990 --> 10:01.949
All the power tools are missing.

10:05.039 --> 10:05.953
What's there?

10:07.476 --> 10:09.347
You think ghosts smoke filtered?

10:09.434 --> 10:11.785
Boss, someone broke
into a storage area

10:11.872 --> 10:14.048
'stole a whole bunch
of equipment and supplies.'

10:14.135 --> 10:16.050
'Maybe they broke
into the house too.'

10:19.793 --> 10:22.665
[instrumental music]

10:33.807 --> 10:36.418
Can I help you?

10:36.505 --> 10:39.856
I see you specialize
in local history, Mr..

10:39.943 --> 10:41.336
Raimey. Philip Raimey.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.903
Yes, and you are?

10:42.990 --> 10:45.122
Looking for information
on Walter Beckworth.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.473
Are you with the police?

10:48.560 --> 10:49.997
Here about the Foster incident?

10:50.084 --> 10:51.259
Yes.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.739
But don't tell anyone.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.218
Patrick Jane.

10:54.305 --> 10:55.785
Well, Mr. Jane

10:55.872 --> 10:57.787
if it's Beckworth
you're interested in

10:57.874 --> 10:59.746
you've come to
the right place.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.184
[music continues]

11:03.271 --> 11:04.228
Thank you.

11:07.101 --> 11:10.060
Agent Cho, of course
I was angry with Foster.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.846
If someone stole your home,
wouldn't you be angry as well?

11:12.933 --> 11:14.761
- He bought the house, Mrs.--
- You don't understand.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.327
A house you haven't lived
in since you were a child.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.590
That's not the point.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.418
Sorry. I didn't know
you were with somebody.

11:20.505 --> 11:23.639
Oh, this is my nephew, Drew.

11:23.726 --> 11:27.512
Agent Cho is asking
questions about Alan Foster.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.645
He wants to know
why I was so upset

11:29.732 --> 11:31.734
with the man who
stole Beckworth.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.781
- It is a complicated issue.
- No, it's not that complicated.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.391
There are many factors
to be considered

11:36.478 --> 11:39.176
economic and emotional.

11:39.263 --> 11:43.528
My nephew is a lawyer.
He's very sensible.

11:43.615 --> 11:44.965
That's good,
because I'm not.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.097
There are no
factors to consider.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.186
Foster was a thief and a liar.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.536
You couldn't afford
the taxes on the house.

11:51.623 --> 11:52.886
You were grateful when
he first purchased it.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.410
What changed your mind?

11:55.497 --> 11:56.933
You have a very good aura.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.414
Thank you.

11:59.501 --> 12:02.112
Excellent color, deep red..

12:02.199 --> 12:04.245
...grounded, realistic.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.902
And Foster's aura...was pink.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.381
Dirty pink.

12:10.468 --> 12:12.949
That's dishonesty,
fecklessness.

12:13.036 --> 12:16.779
When he came to me, he said
he wanted to preserve Beckworth.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.694
He lied to me.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.305
He wanted to gut it,
my childhood home.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.611
'I couldn't let him do that.'

12:22.698 --> 12:24.656
Look, agent,
the Beckworth mansion

12:24.744 --> 12:27.485
is understandably a very
emotional subject for my family

12:27.572 --> 12:30.401
but whatever she
may have felt or said

12:30.488 --> 12:33.230
my aunt is incapable
of hurting anybody.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.276
Where were you last night?

12:36.059 --> 12:37.669
In my home.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.367
In my bed.

12:39.454 --> 12:40.977
Not killing Alan Foster.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.762
- What about you?
- I was here.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.111
I've been staying
with my aunt on and off

12:44.198 --> 12:46.156
ever since she was
forced to sell the place.

12:46.243 --> 12:49.464
He's been helping me out
with my legal things.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.379
I'd be lost without him.

12:51.466 --> 12:54.251
Tax liens and escrow,
nothing too complicated.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.036
[cell phone rings]

12:56.123 --> 12:57.037
Excuse me.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.259
Cho.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.175
Cho, did you ask
about the ghost?

13:05.262 --> 13:07.308
No, you heard Lisbon.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.918
Uh-h-h.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.572
I am talking
to the local historian.

13:10.659 --> 13:13.662
Apparently, Beckworth was
deeply involved in spiritualism.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.359
Liked to explore
the world beyond

13:15.446 --> 13:17.492
held seancesand all
that kind of malarkey.

13:17.579 --> 13:20.800
So ghosts are relevant, my
friend. This is very important.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.891
Cho, don't leave me hanging.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.721
Ma'am, do you know anything
about a ghost at the mansion?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.071
Of course.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.116
That's the spirit
of my grandfather

13:33.203 --> 13:34.639
Walter Beckworth.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.554
He used to visit me
when I was a child.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.819
- She says there's a ghost.
- Thank you.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.995
No surprise there.

13:42.082 --> 13:44.301
[sniffs]
Mmm. Clover honey?

13:44.388 --> 13:46.260
Yes, as a matter of fact it is.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.478
[Jane]
'Mmm.'

13:49.306 --> 13:52.005
- Jane?
- Mm. Sorry.

13:52.092 --> 13:55.182
Uh, Mr. Raimey says there's
also a hidden treasure there.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.488
Uh, rumored treasure,
purely rumored.

13:57.575 --> 14:00.840
Rumored treasure, some fortune
Beckworth hid in the house.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.190
[Jane on phone]
'Does Abner know
anything about that?'

14:03.277 --> 14:06.280
- Beckworth's treasure?
- Oh, yes.

14:06.367 --> 14:09.109
Everybody in the family
knew that there was a great

14:09.196 --> 14:12.721
mythic treasure. We gave up
looking for it years ago.

14:12.808 --> 14:16.899
It was a fraud. If it wasn't,
do you think I'd be living here?

14:16.986 --> 14:18.596
She says no treasure.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.947
Hmm. Got it. Thank you.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.035
Okay.

14:23.079 --> 14:23.993
No treasure.

14:25.473 --> 14:26.822
'Clover honey.'

14:29.825 --> 14:31.261
Ah.

14:31.348 --> 14:34.264
Well...ahem...thank you.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.397
[instrumental music]

14:36.484 --> 14:38.268
If there is anything
else I can do..

14:38.355 --> 14:39.487
Well, there is one more thing.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.619
H-how did Beckworth
make his money?

14:41.706 --> 14:44.884
Oh, he was a bootlegger,
very successful one.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.538
It's in, uh, that one,
the second from the bottom.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.627
Okay. Thank you.

14:49.714 --> 14:53.066
Uh, d-did you ever
cross paths with Foster?

14:53.153 --> 14:54.763
Once or twice.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.635
He seemed pleasant enough.
Never paid very much attention.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.811
You deceitful
old bag of bones.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.683
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.907
[Rigsby]
'Nothing on
the exterior of the house.'

15:07.994 --> 15:10.387
Let's check inside.

15:10.474 --> 15:11.606
- That's weird.
- What?

15:11.693 --> 15:13.521
Thought this was shut.

15:13.608 --> 15:14.783
[creaking]

15:20.789 --> 15:22.965
[rattling]

15:23.052 --> 15:26.751
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah. Someone's upstairs.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.188
I thought everybody left.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.147
[instrumental music]

15:33.410 --> 15:34.368
Hello?

15:43.725 --> 15:44.726
[thud]

15:46.858 --> 15:48.773
It came from in there.

15:56.216 --> 15:57.565
[sizzling]

15:57.652 --> 15:59.306
Old wiring, I guess.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.742
[man laughing]

16:00.829 --> 16:02.222
What was that?

16:02.309 --> 16:05.007
CBI. Come out.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.139
[door creaks]

16:07.053 --> 16:08.097
[door bangs shut]

16:09.925 --> 16:11.840
Police, whoever you are,
come out of the room

16:11.927 --> 16:13.189
'with your hands
above your head.'

16:14.582 --> 16:18.107
[male #2]
'Grace. Over here.'

16:20.631 --> 16:22.503
[instrumental music]

16:24.548 --> 16:25.506
Boo!

16:29.466 --> 16:31.425
[instrumental music]

16:31.512 --> 16:32.469
Jane?

16:33.383 --> 16:34.297
[door bangs shut]

16:40.564 --> 16:43.350
- Where'd he go?
- How'd he do that?

16:43.437 --> 16:45.961
It's easy. I'll show you.

16:47.658 --> 16:50.661
'Ah, you see?'

16:50.748 --> 16:52.707
It's all switches.

16:53.577 --> 16:56.450
[sizzling]

16:58.321 --> 16:59.714
There's a system
of pipes that carry

16:59.801 --> 17:00.715
sound throughout the house.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.195
[laughing]

17:04.110 --> 17:06.808
- Hello?
- Yeah. It's all fake.

17:06.895 --> 17:10.899
Because, my credulous Van Pelt,
spirits are smoke and mirrors

17:10.986 --> 17:12.509
and that's all that they are.

17:12.596 --> 17:13.728
And the ghost?
How did you do that?

17:13.815 --> 17:15.947
Ah, the piece de resistance.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.689
If you could stand in
the corner, my friend Rigsby

17:18.776 --> 17:21.823
and, Grace, if you could take
your place out by the doors.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.694
Pepper's ghost.

17:23.781 --> 17:27.785
It's an old conjurer's trick,
a simple optical illusion.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.484
All you need is a sheet of glass

17:30.571 --> 17:32.616
that slides out of the wall..

17:36.055 --> 17:37.926
It's a reflection?

17:38.013 --> 17:39.493
And lighting.

17:39.580 --> 17:42.409
[sizzling]

17:43.845 --> 17:45.020
[chuckles]

17:46.021 --> 17:48.415
[chuckling continues]

17:48.502 --> 17:50.069
And off.

17:53.028 --> 17:56.075
And Beckworth had all this built
just so he could hold seances?

17:56.162 --> 17:58.164
So he could amaze
and terrify his guests

17:58.251 --> 18:00.992
with his mastery of the occult,
and it's been used recently.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.994
Someone has
cleaned the dust off.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.866
So somebody was
trying to scare Foster.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.302
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

18:06.389 --> 18:07.651
And how did they
get in the house?

18:07.738 --> 18:10.089
The alarm would have
been on the whole time.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.525
Come with me.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.831
Beckworth was a bootlegger
during prohibition

18:13.918 --> 18:15.572
which meant he had
to smuggle liquor

18:15.659 --> 18:17.226
into the house
and hide it someplace

18:17.313 --> 18:18.836
the authorities
couldn't find it.

18:18.923 --> 18:22.275
This house is riddled
with secret passages.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.320
Including ones
that lead outside?

18:28.194 --> 18:29.891
[creaking]

18:33.286 --> 18:34.200
Voila.

18:35.462 --> 18:36.506
Head down. Take a look.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.160
I'll check the outside walls.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.380
No doubt one of us will
find the secret passage.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.601
- After you.
- Oh, thank you.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.958
[indistinct singing]

18:55.046 --> 18:56.309
[bell ringing]

19:01.140 --> 19:03.707
- Jeb Haas?
- Who wants to know?

19:03.794 --> 19:08.364
- Agent Lisbon, CBI.
- Pretty little thing like you?

19:08.451 --> 19:12.238
I have some questions for you
regarding Alan Foster's murder.

19:12.325 --> 19:15.110
I got nothing to tell you.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.504
Looks like there were some
construction supplies stolen

19:17.591 --> 19:18.983
around the time of the murder.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.898
Deputy Fisher says
you're the local thief

19:20.985 --> 19:22.857
most likely to steal
that kind of stuff.

19:22.944 --> 19:25.816
Fisher sent you?
That son of a bitch.

19:25.903 --> 19:28.384
I don't know what
he told you but, uh..

19:28.471 --> 19:30.865
...I don't know anything
about a break-in or any murder.

19:30.952 --> 19:33.607
Then you won't mind coming
down to the station with me.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.348
What if I don't want to go?

19:35.435 --> 19:37.872
Sir, this doesn't
have to be difficult.

19:40.788 --> 19:43.704
[intense music]

19:49.057 --> 19:51.581
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah. You?

20:01.112 --> 20:03.637
Hey, look at that.
Wine cellar.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.029
Wonder if any of
it's still good.

20:05.116 --> 20:06.596
I doubt it.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.251
[rustling]

20:09.338 --> 20:11.427
- What was that?
- Eh, probably rats.

20:11.514 --> 20:14.256
Oh, God, no. I hate rats.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.519
- Oh, it's just a ghost then.
- You don't believe in ghosts.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.434
Yeah, but you do.
Wait upstairs, if you like.

20:18.521 --> 20:21.742
- I'll take this one.
- Oh, thanks. That's okay.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.836
Same night that
Foster was killed

20:28.923 --> 20:31.230
you broke into his pool house
and stole a few thousand dollars

20:31.317 --> 20:33.101
worth of tools and equipment.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.929
We know because we found
some of the stolen equipment

20:35.016 --> 20:36.713
in your vehicle,
and we found this

20:36.800 --> 20:37.888
cigarette butt
in the pool house.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.977
It'll definitely
have your DNA on it.

20:42.197 --> 20:43.677
Everybody knows that
place is all wired up

20:43.764 --> 20:45.548
with some fancy alarm system.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.376
I didn't kill anybody.

20:47.463 --> 20:50.118
I never saw Foster, and I
never went into his house.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.773
- Nice if you could prove that.
- I can't.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.210
But I do have some
particular information

20:55.297 --> 20:57.734
on that evening...
information that you want.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.912
- Okay.
- Uh-uh.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.697
Not until I get
a deal on the theft

21:03.784 --> 21:06.003
and the breaking
and entering charges.

21:06.090 --> 21:09.268
- A good one too.
- You want a deal? Okay.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.052
And just to be clear,
is this a deal for the theft

21:11.139 --> 21:14.403
and B&E alone,
or the tax evasion as well?

21:14.490 --> 21:16.231
What?

21:16.318 --> 21:17.537
According to your IRS records

21:17.624 --> 21:19.930
you haven't filed
a tax return since 2002.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.976
Unless you haven't earned
a dime in income in seven years

21:22.063 --> 21:24.718
you're facing some pretty
serious tax evasion charges.

21:24.805 --> 21:27.460
Do you have any idea how much
prison time that carries?

21:27.547 --> 21:30.941
- Prison time?
- 'Serious time, massive fines.'

21:32.595 --> 21:34.510
I'm gonna let you
think about it.

21:36.860 --> 21:39.950
When I was loading stuff
out of the pool house..

21:40.037 --> 21:42.953
...I saw a car in
the woods, a black BMW.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.259
'There was somebody sitting in'

21:44.346 --> 21:47.262
the driver's seat...
Foster's wife.

21:47.349 --> 21:48.959
Lillian Foster?

21:49.046 --> 21:51.048
I've seen her in town.
She sat there the whole time.

21:51.135 --> 21:54.617
She never even noticed me.
She just stared at the house.

21:54.704 --> 21:57.403
Was she still
there when you left?

21:57.490 --> 21:58.404
Yes.

22:02.277 --> 22:04.975
So you'll do something,
I mean, about the tax thing?

22:06.368 --> 22:08.196
Don't worry.
I was lyin' about that.

22:19.686 --> 22:20.904
- What's wrong with it?
- I don't know.

22:20.991 --> 22:23.472
Maybe the batteries.

22:23.559 --> 22:24.604
Don'thitit.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.083
Fine. You fix it then.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.129
Let's just use mine.

22:29.957 --> 22:32.089
- Ah!
- What? What? What?

22:32.176 --> 22:33.482
Oh, I felt something
crawling up my leg.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.092
- Well, is it still there?
- No.

22:35.179 --> 22:36.746
It was probably just a ghost.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.015
- Grace?
- Yes?

22:47.104 --> 22:48.279
I..

22:50.325 --> 22:51.718
Never mind.

22:53.850 --> 22:56.636
- Maybe we should keep going.
- Yeah.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.507
Grace, I love you.

22:58.594 --> 23:00.509
I've loved you from
the first moment I met you.

23:00.596 --> 23:04.034
Screw the rules.
Screw the CBI. I need you.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.951
I, uh-uh...that's, um..

23:08.038 --> 23:10.301
Unless you stop me,
I'm gonna kiss you now.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.261
[rattling]

23:13.348 --> 23:14.480
Eureka!

23:16.133 --> 23:17.613
Found it!

23:23.489 --> 23:24.968
Good work.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.361
Yeah, we'll meet you
back at the office

23:26.448 --> 23:28.668
after we pick up
Lillian Foster.

23:28.755 --> 23:31.845
We're outside
her house now.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.890
Jane says he found another
entrance to the mansion.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.588
I knew there had
to be another way in.

23:35.675 --> 23:37.764
[Lillian]
'How dare you come here?
My husband just died.'

23:37.851 --> 23:39.330
Is that Victoria Abner
and her nephew?

23:39.418 --> 23:41.115
What are they doing here?

23:41.202 --> 23:42.595
Have you no shame?

23:42.682 --> 23:44.771
Mrs. Foster, if you could
just please calm down.

23:44.858 --> 23:46.294
You know what you are?
You're a vulture.

23:46.381 --> 23:47.861
You're a crazy,
obsessed old vulture!--

23:47.948 --> 23:50.385
That mansion is mine.
It belongs to myfamily.

23:50.472 --> 23:52.431
I will burn it down before
you step foot in that place!

23:52.518 --> 23:54.215
Lady, you need psychiatric help.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.564
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey-hey!

23:55.651 --> 23:58.611
[grunting]

23:58.698 --> 24:00.656
Hey! Break it up!

24:00.743 --> 24:02.658
Get her off of me now!

24:02.745 --> 24:04.704
What the hell is
the matter with you?

24:04.791 --> 24:06.445
You have no class!

24:06.532 --> 24:07.750
You're the one
that came to my house!

24:07.837 --> 24:10.797
[indistinct shouting]

24:10.884 --> 24:12.494
[Victoria]
'Oh, yeah, I'mthe crazy bitch?'

24:19.283 --> 24:21.851
How you feeling,
Mrs. Foster?

24:21.938 --> 24:24.680
Embarrassed.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.901
How'd you get into
the ruckus with Ms. Abner?

24:27.988 --> 24:31.382
She came by to ask if she could
rent the mansion back from me

24:31.470 --> 24:34.385
seeing as how I won't
want to be living there.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.691
Did she say why?

24:35.778 --> 24:38.607
I, uh, didn't wait
to hear the details.

24:38.694 --> 24:41.044
She had been plaguing us
all this time, and now this?

24:42.350 --> 24:45.527
[sighs]
I'm afraid I just...lost it.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.925
There is something else we
wanted to talk to you about.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.274
You weren't in San Francisco

24:53.361 --> 24:55.232
the night of your
husband's murder.

24:55.319 --> 24:57.670
You were at the mansion.

24:57.757 --> 24:59.323
You know about that?

24:59.410 --> 25:03.153
- Why'd you lie to us?
- I was ashamed.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.677
Of what?

25:04.764 --> 25:06.548
Of why I was there
in the first place.

25:06.635 --> 25:09.203
- And why was that?
- She was spying on her husband.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.988
She suspected him
of being unfaithful.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.991
Yes. How did you know that?

25:15.078 --> 25:17.516
Because he's been
unfaithful before?

25:21.258 --> 25:23.217
Yes.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.611
He had an affair
about a year ago.

25:25.698 --> 25:28.091
He was out of town,
I was caught up with my work

25:28.178 --> 25:31.921
and...it happened.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.619
That's very
understanding of you.

25:33.706 --> 25:36.360
Oh, I was furious, believe me.

25:36.447 --> 25:39.102
But we worked on it,
counseling and so forth

25:39.189 --> 25:41.540
and I thought I had moved on.

25:43.280 --> 25:46.109
But I hadn't.
I didn't trust him.

25:46.196 --> 25:48.764
So, when Alan told me he
would be spending this weekend

25:48.851 --> 25:51.419
at the mansion
and wouldn't be coming home..

25:53.160 --> 25:56.729
...I decided I had to go
there to catch him in the act.

25:56.816 --> 25:57.991
But no one showed up.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.080
No.

26:00.167 --> 26:03.387
I felt so awful that I
left without talking to him.

26:03.474 --> 26:06.565
- What time did you leave?
- Around ten.

26:08.175 --> 26:10.133
Is there any way
to prove that?

26:10.220 --> 26:13.789
Um, I bought gas
on the way home.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.357
The credit card company will
have a record of that, right?

26:16.444 --> 26:18.359
Yes, we'll verify that.

26:20.491 --> 26:23.233
I can't help thinking
that if I'd stayed there

26:23.320 --> 26:24.844
if I'd just gone
and talked to Alan

26:24.931 --> 26:27.150
he would still be alive.

26:27.237 --> 26:29.588
Mmm, most likely
you'd both be dead.

26:31.241 --> 26:34.157
With the way that I feel,
I might prefer that.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.899
That feeling will pass.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.162
What do you know about that?

26:39.249 --> 26:40.729
Enough.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.823
- How you doing, Drew?
- Fine.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.695
Thank you. Thanks.

26:49.782 --> 26:51.392
Now your aunt's gonna be
in with us a little longer.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.307
This fight's gonna take
some sorting out, okay?

26:53.394 --> 26:55.048
[sighs]
I tried to stop it
from escalating.

26:55.135 --> 26:56.702
That's why I was there
in the first place

26:56.789 --> 26:59.661
but the hostility just
kind of caught me off guard.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.707
It'll be up to your aunt
whether or not to press charges

27:01.794 --> 27:03.447
but you're a lawyer.
You know the deal.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.232
Well, I'm not
exactly a lawyer.

27:05.319 --> 27:08.452
My aunt likes to exaggerate.
I'm a paralegal.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.150
Cho, uh, I'm sorry.
You got a second?

27:10.237 --> 27:12.543
Sure. We're still gonna
need a statement from you.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.023
Excuse me for a second.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.201
- What's up?
- I told Grace I love her.

27:18.288 --> 27:20.943
Wow. Okay. Well done.
Then what happened?

27:21.030 --> 27:22.205
Oh, nothing,
Jane interrupted

27:22.292 --> 27:23.859
and she hasn't
said a word since.

27:23.946 --> 27:26.732
- So tell her again.
- Right, okay.

27:26.819 --> 27:28.690
Tell her again.
Yeah, alright.

27:33.390 --> 27:36.480
Your aura is
fascinating, Mr. Jane.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.134
So many hues.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.659
Thank you.

27:40.746 --> 27:44.184
The mansion's uninhabitable.
Why would you want it back?

27:44.271 --> 27:46.099
Sentimental reasons.

27:46.186 --> 27:48.188
Mmm, no.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.059
No, that's not right.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.627
You're closed, furtive.
You're hiding something.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.324
There's something in
that house, isn't there?

27:54.411 --> 27:57.588
Something you don't want
anyone else to find..

27:57.676 --> 27:59.852
...evidence of
your guilt, perhaps.

27:59.939 --> 28:01.418
That's absurd.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.594
No, yeah, you're right.
That is absurd.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.423
It's something
else entirely.

28:06.510 --> 28:09.296
Ah...the treasure.

28:09.383 --> 28:10.471
[chuckles]

28:10.558 --> 28:11.559
What treasure?

28:11.646 --> 28:12.691
Walter Beckworth's treasure

28:12.778 --> 28:15.519
he hid in the mansion.

28:15.606 --> 28:16.738
I wanted my house back

28:16.825 --> 28:17.783
because I didn't like

28:17.870 --> 28:19.045
what Foster planned for it.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.003
He was going to destroy it.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.049
[Lisbon]
'Foster had only
been there a few weeks.'

28:23.136 --> 28:25.834
How could you have known what
he was gonna do before he did?

28:25.921 --> 28:29.142
In conversation, he told me.

28:29.229 --> 28:32.493
Ma'am, we find out you're lying,
you become suspect number one.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.107
Alright.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.677
How are you with riddles?

28:45.201 --> 28:46.202
[chuckles]

28:46.289 --> 28:48.639
I found the clue
a few weeks ago

28:48.727 --> 28:50.380
when I bought some
of Beckworth's papers

28:50.467 --> 28:51.947
at an estate sale.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.210
It was in a letter
to one of his cousins

28:54.297 --> 28:55.908
just before his death.

28:55.995 --> 28:59.085
Beckworth boasts that he's
hidden his great treasure

28:59.172 --> 29:00.913
where no one
can find it

29:01.000 --> 29:03.002
and then he
offers this clue

29:03.089 --> 29:05.569
"If fortune is
what you seek sincere

29:05.656 --> 29:07.615
the only place
to look is here."

29:08.877 --> 29:09.922
That's it?
That's the riddle?

29:10.009 --> 29:11.837
- Yes.
- Interesting.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.839
Of course, I told
Mrs. Abner right away

29:13.926 --> 29:16.015
but the house had already
been sold to Foster.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.799
Why didn't you
mention this before?

29:17.886 --> 29:20.541
Well, it-it...
it didn't seem relevant.

29:20.628 --> 29:23.326
It's motive. It's very relevant.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.894
Mr. Raimey and Ms. Abner
had agreed to keep quiet

29:25.981 --> 29:29.158
to avoid having to share the
loot with anyone else, correct?

29:29.245 --> 29:32.248
Yes, but that doesn't mean
either of us killed Foster.

29:32.335 --> 29:33.380
Oh, absolutely right.

29:33.467 --> 29:34.990
Whoever killed
Foster was simply

29:35.077 --> 29:38.167
trying to scare
him from the mansion.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.169
It could have been anyone
that wanted the treasure

29:40.256 --> 29:42.041
even you, Deputy Fisher.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.520
That's right. I killed him.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.392
Did you? You denied it earlier.

29:45.479 --> 29:46.785
Stop doing that.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.743
I need to see this clue.
Where's the letter?

29:56.185 --> 29:57.491
Thank you.

29:59.406 --> 30:00.929
[sniffs]

30:01.016 --> 30:02.757
- What?
- Smells good.

30:02.844 --> 30:06.543
"If fortune is
what you seek sincere

30:06.630 --> 30:12.027
the only place
to look is... hear."

30:12.114 --> 30:14.290
"Hear."

30:14.377 --> 30:17.076
It's spelled H-E-A-R.

30:17.163 --> 30:20.122
Well, I assumed
it was a mistake.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.124
Hmm. There are no mistakes.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.386
Let's go.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.738
[instrumental music]

30:28.827 --> 30:29.958
[door closes]

30:31.786 --> 30:34.571
[instrumental music]

30:39.620 --> 30:41.752
[indistinct chattering]

30:41.840 --> 30:46.148
[clears throat]
As you know, Walter Beckworth
left a coded message

30:46.235 --> 30:49.499
describing the location
of his treasure.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.414
I brought you all here
to help me find it.

30:51.501 --> 30:55.114
The word "here" is
misspelled in the riddle.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.508
I don't believe
that's a mistake.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.162
I think..

31:00.249 --> 31:01.772
...that the clue itself

31:01.860 --> 31:03.470
lies in that word

31:03.557 --> 31:07.169
hear, H-E-A-R.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.999
What comes to mind
when I say the word hear?

31:13.959 --> 31:15.047
Noise.

31:17.005 --> 31:19.181
- Sounds.
- Ears.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.967
Very good. What else?

31:22.054 --> 31:23.359
Music.

31:23.446 --> 31:24.447
Musical instruments.

31:24.534 --> 31:25.709
Definite possibility.

31:30.149 --> 31:31.324
Cho?

31:31.411 --> 31:34.153
[instrumental music]

31:38.548 --> 31:40.028
Unveil it.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.081
[creaks]

31:52.911 --> 31:54.042
[piano music]

32:03.269 --> 32:05.532
[tapping]

32:06.489 --> 32:09.101
[tapping continues]

32:09.840 --> 32:13.322
Mmm. Aha.

32:13.409 --> 32:14.628
What is it?

32:14.715 --> 32:15.890
Yeah, what is it?

32:31.123 --> 32:32.472
Beckworth's fortune.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.484
[exhales deeply]

32:44.571 --> 32:46.399
[Raimey]
'There's nothing in it.'

32:46.486 --> 32:47.835
[Drew]
'It's empty?'

32:47.922 --> 32:48.967
[Jane]
Wait.

32:57.888 --> 32:58.933
[Victoria]
'What is that?'

32:59.020 --> 33:00.369
It's another riddle.

33:00.456 --> 33:02.154
What does it say?

33:02.241 --> 33:05.070
"To find fortune and riches,
one doesn't need help.

33:05.157 --> 33:08.247
All one must do
is look to oneself."

33:13.556 --> 33:15.167
What does it mean?

33:15.254 --> 33:17.386
I don't know,
but it's spelled correctly.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.606
It means we're
wasting our time.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.086
It doesn't even make any sense.

33:21.173 --> 33:22.826
Let's not rush to judgment.

33:22.913 --> 33:25.525
Beckworth probably put it
there as a practical joke.

33:25.612 --> 33:26.874
Pretty lame joke.

33:26.961 --> 33:28.223
But the fortune
could still be here.

33:28.310 --> 33:29.746
I just need time to find it.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.096
We're not gonna
waste any more time.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.881
I'm shutting this down.
Everybody out.

33:33.968 --> 33:35.665
'Cho, secure the place
and set the alarm.'

33:35.752 --> 33:38.277
'Have Rigsby and Van Pelt
set up on the mansion tonight.'

33:38.364 --> 33:39.843
'We'll take
the shift after them.'

33:39.930 --> 33:41.019
Nobody gets in this place

33:41.106 --> 33:42.585
especially Jane. Understood?

33:42.672 --> 33:44.544
- Got it. Everybody out.
- 'L-Lisbon.'

33:44.631 --> 33:46.589
Lisbon. I, you, I-I,
this, Lisbon, this--

33:46.676 --> 33:48.722
Bite me.
We're done for the night.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.514
"Bite me?"

33:58.601 --> 34:01.126
- It's too much?
- Uh, a smidge.

34:04.564 --> 34:06.870
Worked. It's fine.

34:06.957 --> 34:09.134
Just a little over-the-top.

34:09.221 --> 34:12.093
[crickets chirping]

34:30.764 --> 34:32.026
- So, uh, Grace..
- Yes?

34:32.113 --> 34:34.159
...I was wondering
if we could..

34:34.246 --> 34:37.292
- How do you wanna handle this?
- Handle what?

34:37.379 --> 34:38.946
The stakeout.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.122
Oh. Um, right.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.952
Listen, about
the other thing..

34:45.039 --> 34:46.649
...it's, I, uh..

34:49.348 --> 34:51.611
Maybe it's not
the right time.

34:51.698 --> 34:53.221
Yeah. Yeah.

34:53.308 --> 34:56.398
Um...we could, uh, walk.

34:57.573 --> 35:00.402
Patrol the grounds.

35:00.489 --> 35:02.535
Or maybe one of us
could stay here

35:02.622 --> 35:05.233
while the other one
patrols alternate?

35:05.320 --> 35:07.844
Yep, that's better.
I'll, uh, I'll go first.

35:07.931 --> 35:10.064
Oh, that's okay.
I can do it.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.022
[Rigsby]
I'm easy.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.633
[Grace]
'Well, if you wanna go
first, that's fine also.'

35:13.720 --> 35:16.244
[Rigsby]
No, no. No.

35:23.860 --> 35:26.776
[intense music]

35:35.307 --> 35:36.830
[creaking]

35:49.103 --> 35:50.452
"Look to oneself."

35:53.238 --> 35:56.066
[music continues]

36:04.640 --> 36:07.295
[shattering]

36:08.209 --> 36:09.297
No.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.215
There's nothin' there,
Drew. Never was.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.392
You planted the second clue?

36:17.479 --> 36:19.525
Aha. Yes.

36:21.483 --> 36:22.745
I didn't kill Foster.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.617
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course, you did.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.184
Only the killer knew
how to get in here

36:26.271 --> 36:27.837
viathe secret passageway.

36:27.924 --> 36:30.275
You proved your guilt
just by walking in the room.

36:30.362 --> 36:31.450
[sighs]

36:31.537 --> 36:33.408
Was it all just
for the money?

36:38.631 --> 36:40.589
"Justfor the money?"

36:42.461 --> 36:45.551
I spent years listening
to my family go on

36:45.638 --> 36:48.118
about the Beckworths
and everything that they had.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.165
'I didn't get any of it.'

36:52.166 --> 36:55.125
Not one thing.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.606
And then my aunt told me
about the clue and the treasure

36:57.693 --> 37:01.523
and I thought...I could
get that for myself.

37:01.610 --> 37:05.919
I could have what I've
deserved all my life.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.617
All I had to do was get
Foster out of the house.

37:08.704 --> 37:11.838
So you haunted him.

37:11.925 --> 37:14.580
My cousin told me
about the, uh, equipment

37:14.667 --> 37:17.322
Beckworth had built in.

37:17.409 --> 37:18.932
I just wanted to scare him.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.892
[Drew]
But Foster
wouldn't take a hint.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.332
So I had to do something.

37:31.684 --> 37:34.034
[growly]
You.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.264
Hey! Hey!

37:46.351 --> 37:49.310
Hey, hey, stop!
Hey, stop!

37:51.573 --> 37:53.358
I didn't mean to kill him.

37:53.445 --> 37:56.230
[intense music]

38:00.234 --> 38:02.889
Oh, I didn't know what to do.

38:02.976 --> 38:06.936
And then, uh, I remembered
the stories about Beckworth

38:07.023 --> 38:11.158
how he was killed, how his
ghost still haunts this place.

38:11.245 --> 38:12.681
So I threw him out the window

38:12.768 --> 38:14.422
the same way
Beckworth was killed.

38:16.381 --> 38:20.602
It wasn't Foster's house.
It belonged to myfamily.

38:20.689 --> 38:23.301
Put your hands
behind your back.Now.

38:29.785 --> 38:31.526
When you first opened
the box under the piano

38:31.613 --> 38:33.572
was there anything in it?

38:33.659 --> 38:35.791
Mmm..

38:35.878 --> 38:37.053
...this.

38:38.881 --> 38:41.014
You killed Foster
for an old key.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.974
I wonder what it opens.

38:45.061 --> 38:47.499
- Oh, I know what it opens.
- What?

38:50.937 --> 38:54.114
He's just messing with you.
He's mean like that.

38:54.201 --> 38:55.507
'Come on.'

39:03.993 --> 39:05.560
Mr. Jane.

39:05.647 --> 39:07.693
I was just being briefed
by one of your agents.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.259
Well, I hope they
conducted themselves

39:09.347 --> 39:10.913
in a professional manner.

39:12.437 --> 39:15.048
Thank you...for everything.

39:15.135 --> 39:18.181
Well, my pleasure.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.183
Do you mind a question?

39:21.794 --> 39:23.709
Uh...no.

39:26.189 --> 39:28.714
I asked about you.

39:28.801 --> 39:32.979
What happened to your
family, I'm very sorry.

39:33.066 --> 39:36.461
And I thought...maybe
it means you understand

39:36.548 --> 39:39.246
how it feels
to lose somebody.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.030
Was that your question?

39:43.685 --> 39:45.600
Do you think they
know how we feel?

39:47.297 --> 39:50.083
The dead, I mean..

39:50.170 --> 39:52.607
...how sorry we are..

39:52.694 --> 39:54.653
...how we wish things
could be different?

39:56.742 --> 39:59.135
[crying]
Do you think
they understand?

39:59.222 --> 40:02.095
[instrumental music]

40:05.359 --> 40:06.447
No.

40:10.799 --> 40:11.887
Sorry.

40:12.975 --> 40:13.889
[sniffles]

40:23.072 --> 40:24.291
Case closed pizza?

40:24.378 --> 40:25.771
Case closed pizza.

40:25.858 --> 40:27.729
Rigsby eats all the sausage
again, I'll be pissed.

40:29.470 --> 40:31.864
- Are you okay?
- Right as rain.

40:31.951 --> 40:34.083
Oh, I have the perfect
thing to go with this.

40:44.398 --> 40:45.834
- Wine?
- Yeah.

40:45.921 --> 40:47.880
Just a little
something special.

40:53.102 --> 40:55.975
Excuse me.
I need a glass. Sorry.

40:56.062 --> 40:57.193
Sure.

41:04.766 --> 41:07.465
[instrumental music]

41:22.175 --> 41:24.960
[music continues]

41:34.579 --> 41:36.015
I'm gonna leave
in a few minutes.

41:36.102 --> 41:37.582
Wait five,
then meet me at my car.

41:37.669 --> 41:39.540
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:41.803 --> 41:44.502
[music continues]

41:48.418 --> 41:49.768
Just a little.

41:56.252 --> 41:59.299
- Please.
- Thanks.

41:59.386 --> 42:01.780
- Mr. Rigsby.
- Cheers.

42:04.870 --> 42:05.827
Case closed.

42:05.914 --> 42:07.525
[all]
Case closed.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.093
- Mmm. It's nice.
- Glad you like it.

42:11.180 --> 42:13.182
So what was the key to, Jane?
The one you found in the box.

42:13.269 --> 42:16.490
- The key? Beckworth's fortune.
- Give it up.

42:16.577 --> 42:18.884
Well, just because the fortune
wasn't gold or cash

42:18.971 --> 42:21.713
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

42:21.800 --> 42:24.237
- So what was it?
- Beckworth was a collector.

42:24.324 --> 42:26.805
He collected
hundreds of one thing

42:26.892 --> 42:29.024
some of the finest,
rarest examples in the world

42:29.111 --> 42:30.852
worth tens
of millions of dollars.

42:30.939 --> 42:32.593
- So what was it?
- Mmm.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.290
- 'What?'
- Smells good.

42:34.377 --> 42:37.163
[instrumental music]

42:44.866 --> 42:45.824
Cheers.
