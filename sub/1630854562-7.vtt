WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:11.545
Do you think becoming
a marquise

00:11.545 --> 00:13.481
<i>was in the destiny
for someone like me?</i>

00:13.481 --> 00:17.151
Walk away and find peace,
Camille, or you will lose me.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.221
This was retrieved
from a dead woman's throat.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.156
I've seen this thread before.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.391
<i>The Montrachets</i>

00:23.391 --> 00:24.725
<i>betrayed me in the worst
of ways.</i>

00:24.725 --> 00:26.727
Forgive me for what I want.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.096
<i>Thou shalt
not commit adultery.</i>

00:29.096 --> 00:30.331
If you are scared, go.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.665
I have no further need
of you tonight.

00:31.665 --> 00:34.235
Don't treat me like a servant.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.436
I'm your friend.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.438
<i>When Monsieur de Montrachet</i>

00:37.438 --> 00:38.773
<i>has the king's ear,</i>

00:38.773 --> 00:42.376
he will be able to have
whatever he wants.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.746
Pascal.

00:45.746 --> 00:49.049
We'll start again.
I'll make a good life for us.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.317
<i>Do not come
looking for me</i>

00:50.317 --> 00:52.219
<i>or the letters I have taken.</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:53.687
I don't want to be without you.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.055
Marry me.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.392
From the palace.

01:44.805 --> 01:45.873
Madame.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.640
Victoire left me.

03:38.719 --> 03:42.222
She'll come back.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.326
Victoire wanted me
to make peace with the past,

03:45.326 --> 03:47.628
but I can't.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.496
Not until I make them pay.

03:57.805 --> 04:02.009
Montrachet is more powerful now
than even a marquis' wife.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.013
I thought he was gone
from my grasp.

04:10.584 --> 04:14.321
And then, last night,

04:14.321 --> 04:17.324
after you and I parted,

04:17.324 --> 04:19.326
I came across the queen.

04:22.396 --> 04:25.532
And she knows too well
the risk of someone

04:25.532 --> 04:28.936
with a secret
to protect or exploit.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.006
So I still need the letter.

04:34.308 --> 04:37.411
If you can win her in writing,

04:37.411 --> 04:39.747
then I can give
the letter to the queen.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.483
If I can't destroy them,
the queen will.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.818
Mere mortals
do not go to Versailles.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.788
You will not get close
to the queen again.

04:50.691 --> 04:54.328
The queen's opera,
written by your chevalier.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.731
No one turns down
a royal invitation,

04:57.731 --> 05:01.368
especially not the king's
physician and his wife.

05:01.368 --> 05:04.304
I will give
the queen the letter.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.373
She will banish them.

05:06.373 --> 05:08.709
They will be humiliated.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.711
The integrity
of the messenger

05:10.711 --> 05:14.848
is as important
as the message itself.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.085
A devout soul, full of morality
and above reproach,

05:18.318 --> 05:21.321
would serve your cause
far better.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.925
I'm not acquainted
with such a soul.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.396
You don't recall the man
at the heart of this scandal?

05:31.732 --> 05:35.536
His conscience compels him

05:35.536 --> 05:36.670
to warn the queen

05:36.670 --> 05:38.338
and protect the king.

05:43.510 --> 05:47.648
Let Lucienne
deliver the letter.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.783
And let him disappear
like the lie he is

05:49.783 --> 05:52.019
and us to be free
from all of this.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.724
This is how the story ends.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.470
I've missed you.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.727
The opera is the night
after tomorrow.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.864
Can you get the letter by then?

07:10.864 --> 07:12.800
Before.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.837
All you need to do
is leave Saint-HonorÃ©.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.172
I'll meet you
at the Luxembourg Gardens

07:18.172 --> 07:19.706
at 8:00 tomorrow night.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.644
I love you.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.782
How long I have waited
to hear that.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.930
Your lecture
was not well received?

07:47.968 --> 07:50.971
There was a discussion of you.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.906
One of the young
men who was at the ball.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.843
He spoke to me
after the lecture to warn me.

07:58.912 --> 08:02.082
He witnessed you
with another man,

08:02.082 --> 08:03.851
reaching inside his shirt.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.556
You've accused me
previously of being lifeless.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.792
I didn't mean it
as a challenge.

08:11.792 --> 08:15.095
Isn't that what
society does when masked?

08:16.964 --> 08:19.800
Forgive me, I've been
out of it for so long.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.635
I'm, er, out of touch.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.141
You were with another man.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.645
Do you have any idea
what happens

08:31.645 --> 08:33.080
if these rumors reach the king?

08:34.781 --> 08:36.283
It would destroy
the opportunity

08:36.516 --> 08:38.218
before me at Versailles.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.754
You make not simply
a fool of me,

08:40.754 --> 08:42.856
but you put everything at risk!

08:45.893 --> 08:49.630
If you cannot behave
as a wife should for my sake,

08:49.630 --> 08:52.199
then do so for yours.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.601
Be sure you have
as much to lose as I.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.950
I will bring you
chamomile, madame.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.019
Thank you.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.823
Are we expecting visitors?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.958
There wouldn't be
enough room for anyone else.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.928
Such has the marquis' affection
for you expanded.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.232
He requests you
in the drawing room.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.945
You've been eluding me
all morning,

10:44.945 --> 10:47.214
but I've filled it
with thoughts of you.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.149
Oh.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.150
And flowers.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.385
Mm-hmm.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.415
Oh...

11:21.415 --> 11:23.717
The toy is named Solomon.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.019
Such is the beauty of his song.

11:26.019 --> 11:30.123
Jean...

11:30.123 --> 11:32.159
Jean, I must speak with you.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.895
You're unhappy with the bird.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.130
I have used the day
to think about the idea

11:37.130 --> 11:39.299
of our marriage.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.334
I forced you into its creation.

11:41.334 --> 11:44.905
I pushed you when you had
been exploited already.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.706
Because you wanted me.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.175
Of course.

11:48.175 --> 11:51.178
But I have thought on it,
and it is not fair to you.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.713
You have scarcely had time
to grieve your first marriage.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.015
I grieved during it.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.284
But all
that has followed since,

11:57.284 --> 12:00.120
it is too much for you
to keep a clear head,

12:00.120 --> 12:02.923
for you to be sure
of what you want.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.492
And I must be sure
you are sure.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.960
Think on it, Jean.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.362
Take more time, please,

12:09.362 --> 12:11.798
if only to assuage the guilt
I feel

12:11.798 --> 12:15.302
at having manipulated you
into believing you desire me.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.174
Think on it.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.028
And she awaits me
with open arms.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.382
I must discuss
the orphanage with you.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.184
There's been a development.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.420
My husband and I are leaving
for Versailles.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.190
You may direct your requests
for funding to him.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.859
It is a private matter
I wish to discuss.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.579
Look at me, please.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.058
I did not take you
for a cruel man.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.829
Do you forget how you made
a fool of me?

13:49.829 --> 13:53.133
It is I who is the fool.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.202
I could not give a name
to the feelings

13:55.202 --> 13:58.004
you awakened in me.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.173
But now I know,
I am full of regret

14:00.173 --> 14:02.042
that I did not
take you last night

14:02.042 --> 14:03.977
and make love to you
till we could not see

14:03.977 --> 14:08.081
or feel the world around us.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.450
For you to speak to me
this way...

14:14.387 --> 14:16.623
...you condemn your soul.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.205
I do not care
what happens to my soul.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.245
<i>I cannot give you up.</i>

14:38.245 --> 14:39.946
I'm not yours to give up.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.056
You saved me from myself.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.428
I will remember you
in my prayer.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.663
Our business here is done.

15:16.983 --> 15:18.985
I must go again
to her tomorrow.

15:18.985 --> 15:22.489
I must raise my game.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.025
I made a promise to Camille.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.259
Well, unmake it.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.560
I love her.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.062
<i>Can't you see
what she's doing to you?</i>

15:29.062 --> 15:31.164
You're going to approach
the queen and lie to her!

15:31.164 --> 15:32.932
It will not be a lie.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.501
Well, it's not
a truth either.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.570
It's her revenge, not yours.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.506
<i>Camille will ruin you,</i>

15:39.506 --> 15:42.042
and I can't save you
because you don't believe

15:42.042 --> 15:44.010
you deserve to be saved.

15:48.682 --> 15:52.085
The fact that you ask me to
consider my offer of marriage

15:52.085 --> 15:53.720
only further adds
to my certainty

15:53.953 --> 15:56.523
that you are unlike
any other woman.

15:56.523 --> 16:00.126
I can have my priest here
within the hour.

16:00.126 --> 16:04.364
Jean, I have dreamed
of my wedding day.

16:04.364 --> 16:08.535
You think it can be arranged
within one hour?

16:08.535 --> 16:10.704
I want to plan every detail.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.144
Do not turn
compassion into torture.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.714
Why would you deny me now?

16:20.714 --> 16:24.050
You don't imagine I would want
all those I care for

16:24.050 --> 16:25.085
at the wedding?

16:25.085 --> 16:27.053
We'll invite everyone.

16:27.053 --> 16:29.322
I'll host all of Paris
if you desire it.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.235
<i>My darling Valmont.</i>

16:42.235 --> 16:44.404
<i>Hurry, my love,</i>

16:44.404 --> 16:47.540
<i>with this wretched task
I have set you.</i>

17:35.722 --> 17:39.692
<i>And as you promise
to avenge me,</i>

17:39.692 --> 17:41.694
<i>I promise the same to you.</i>

17:43.730 --> 17:45.698
<i>Your Camille.</i>

17:56.276 --> 17:59.412
A wedding gift, how kind.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.328
Perhaps it's your sense
of humor

18:15.328 --> 18:17.197
or unfamiliarity with me,

18:17.197 --> 18:19.199
but this is not to my taste.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.869
Forgive me.
I-I was misinformed.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.537
Beg your pardon?

18:24.537 --> 18:28.508
Though they were very clear...
at the Labyrinth Club.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.516
See, they've written down

18:36.516 --> 18:39.452
every one
of your liaisons there.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.554
You insult me, mademoiselle?

18:41.554 --> 18:45.492
Ugh, how clumsy of me.
I mean to warn you.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.327
<i>I mean,
your forthcoming wedding</i>

18:47.327 --> 18:49.462
<i>and the elevation
in your status,</i>

18:49.462 --> 18:51.164
the dowry that will pay
for a good deal

18:51.164 --> 18:54.400
of your gambling debts--
they mentioned those too--

18:54.400 --> 18:57.704
<i>all are at risk,
Vicomte de Valmont,</i>

18:57.704 --> 19:00.740
if your affairs
were to come to light.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.476
And then, of course,
there is your mother.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.216
What do you want?

19:10.216 --> 19:11.918
For you not to live a lie...

19:12.151 --> 19:13.820
I'll not be judged by you.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.456
Because I do not judge you.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.592
I'm no stranger
to variety myself,

19:19.592 --> 19:22.695
but I will exploit infidelity
where I find it.

19:24.697 --> 19:28.301
<i>The lie I speak of
is your title of vicomte.</i>

19:28.301 --> 19:32.338
You've taken the life
another man should have had.

19:32.338 --> 19:36.276
And while we may admire
your mother's ambition,

19:36.276 --> 19:39.245
the title belongs
to someone else.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.881
And you are the only person

19:41.881 --> 19:44.584
who can make her return it
to the rightful heir,

19:44.584 --> 19:46.286
<i>to Pascal.</i>

19:48.555 --> 19:50.456
That is what I want
for my silence.

19:55.461 --> 19:56.729
Come.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.302
Ugh.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.505
I'm busy, CarrÃ©.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.707
Forgive me, sir,

20:07.707 --> 20:09.776
but I've made some advances
in the case.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.381
You've taken up
needlework, huh?

20:15.381 --> 20:16.916
<i>A surgeon
I've talked with has found</i>

20:16.916 --> 20:18.418
this thread in another woman,

20:18.418 --> 20:20.887
also found in the river.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.556
Both found dead
in the same way,

20:23.556 --> 20:24.924
choked by this thread.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.662
Are you familiar with the myth
of the labyrinth, sir?

20:31.698 --> 20:34.567
A place to find one's way
by following a crimson thread

20:34.567 --> 20:36.402
such as this,

20:36.402 --> 20:38.371
a place that was home
to a minotaur,

20:38.371 --> 20:40.873
half man and half bull,

20:40.873 --> 20:43.509
a monster to whom
young women of beauty

20:43.509 --> 20:45.011
were sacrificed.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.316
There is such a place in Paris,

20:50.316 --> 20:53.286
a nefarious institute
known as the Labyrinth Club.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.924
Sir, I believe a person
within this club

20:57.924 --> 20:59.559
is responsible
for this depravity.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.494
I would like your permission
to go there

21:01.494 --> 21:02.729
and question all involved!

21:04.998 --> 21:07.700
You return to your work.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.535
This is my work!

21:14.941 --> 21:16.809
Forgive me, sir.

21:16.809 --> 21:20.313
You're losing
control of yourself.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.782
Now, I'm warning you, CarrÃ©.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.385
Forget this matter...

21:27.854 --> 21:29.522
...and all that goes with it.

21:46.372 --> 21:48.541
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

21:48.541 --> 21:50.076
Come on. Come back.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.944
<i>Come back here.</i>

21:51.944 --> 21:53.579
- <i>Ow!</i>
- See these are distributed.

21:53.579 --> 21:56.349
<i>Oh! Ow!</i>

21:56.349 --> 21:57.450
<i>Wait.</i>

21:59.852 --> 22:03.089
Madame de Montrachet,
wait, please.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.825
Where does this end, monsieur?

22:05.825 --> 22:09.462
Do you intend to ambush me
into corruption with you?

22:09.462 --> 22:11.998
I'm going to Versailles
with my husband.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.805
I wanted only to thank you
and to offer an apology.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.942
How could I imagine
that you would want me

22:22.942 --> 22:24.377
over your husband,

22:24.377 --> 22:26.746
a man who writes
a treatise on the human soul

22:26.746 --> 22:28.548
when I can barely feel mine?

22:32.351 --> 22:36.456
I mistook your devotion to God
as loneliness,

22:36.456 --> 22:38.124
like my own.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.029
But you could not be lonely
because you could not

22:43.029 --> 22:46.666
be unloved...

22:46.666 --> 22:48.701
not for a moment.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.642
I underestimated
your marriage, Jacqueline,

22:56.642 --> 22:58.010
and for that, I am sorry.

23:01.481 --> 23:04.050
You are disingenuous to praise
my husband in this way.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.919
Only yesterday,
you said you wished

23:06.919 --> 23:08.788
to make love to me
till we could not see

23:08.788 --> 23:10.656
or hear the world around us.

23:10.656 --> 23:12.525
And I do not deny it.

23:15.061 --> 23:18.931
I am sick with love.

23:18.931 --> 23:23.503
I wanted to possess you,

23:23.503 --> 23:26.472
to fling you down upon a bed,

23:26.472 --> 23:31.110
to hold you in my arms,

23:31.110 --> 23:35.748
to walk with you
beside a river,

23:35.748 --> 23:38.651
lay flowers on your pillow
for when you wake.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.523
Then how can you
reconcile yourself

23:43.523 --> 23:44.924
to living without all of that?

23:44.924 --> 23:46.859
I can't.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.031
That's why I'm leaving Paris.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.886
Lucienne.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.723
And what of me?

24:18.925 --> 24:21.460
I imagine confession
will suffice.

26:32.758 --> 26:36.295
"I must see you
before I leave Paris.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.930
Come to the house."

27:11.130 --> 27:15.267
Monsieur Lucienne, madame.

27:15.267 --> 27:18.004
Thank you
for coming, Monsieur Lucienne.

27:18.004 --> 27:21.674
We will discuss the orphanage
and how it may work between us

27:21.674 --> 27:25.411
when I'm in Versailles.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.747
I'm at your service, madame.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.257
I will call the orphanage,

27:38.257 --> 27:43.095
whichever part of the world
I build it, after you.

27:43.095 --> 27:46.265
I'll call it
The Children of Jacqueline.

27:46.265 --> 27:49.802
And I will think of you
each day I spend there.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.171
I do not want to talk
about the orphanage.

27:53.372 --> 27:57.143
Why else would you ask me here?

27:57.143 --> 28:00.279
You're wrong
about my husband.

28:00.279 --> 28:03.282
I have said as much
and apologized.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.786
In your charitable thoughts
of him, you're wrong.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.788
I am alone in this marriage.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.322
Does it corrupt my soul
to tell you

28:10.322 --> 28:13.926
that I am glad to hear it?

28:13.926 --> 28:17.329
Well, if it does, then
you must pray for us both.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.700
I do not need
to pray for you.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.439
Then you do not know my soul.

29:08.981 --> 29:12.785
Let me show you
my soul, Lucienne.

29:12.785 --> 29:14.353
I see it already.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.031
If you did, you would not
kiss me like that.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.402
Like this, perhaps?

29:53.192 --> 29:55.961
She-she covered me in blood.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.229
Let's not spend
this precious time

29:57.229 --> 30:01.500
remembering such a brutal act.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.402
I want you
to make love to me

30:03.402 --> 30:06.205
till you shut out the world
around me.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.307
But fir-but first, Lucienne,
I need you

30:08.307 --> 30:10.342
to hear my confession.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.811
Lucienne.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.881
Lucienne, my confession.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.583
My confession.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.525
Until you've heard it,
we cannot truly be together.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.411
Cam-Camille was our servant.

30:51.617 --> 30:55.387
My-my husband defiled her
and left her with child.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.126
I could not let her
destroy my marriage.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.295
God forgives you.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.609
No, not for this sin.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.283
This is my soul, Lucienne.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.087
This is my daughter, Odette.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.647
She has her father's smile
and her mother's eyes.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.285
And they are such eyes.

32:35.688 --> 32:37.489
But they're not mine.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.201
I'm barren.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.678
I took her

32:59.678 --> 33:01.313
while the servant girl
was sleeping

33:01.313 --> 33:03.048
after giving birth.

33:26.205 --> 33:28.340
Do you think I go to church
to praise Him?

33:32.044 --> 33:33.779
I go to be forgiven.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.428
Will-will you have me now?

33:56.402 --> 33:57.503
I don't want to go
to Versailles.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.204
I want to stay with you.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.261
I'll make a plan.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.633
I'll find a way for us
to be together.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.808
Put your faith in me, my love.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.863
Azolan.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.433
I need you to go to Camille
and remind her

35:34.433 --> 35:36.134
we are to meet
at the Luxembourg Gardens

35:36.134 --> 35:38.370
at 8:00 tonight.

35:38.370 --> 35:41.139
And I need you to take a letter
to Madame de Montrachet.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.842
Wait for her reply.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.812
Then pack up all
that's important here.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.214
Hire a cart and meet me
at Montmartre.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.520
We are leaving, Azolan.

36:22.481 --> 36:25.183
<i>Here is our plan.</i>

36:25.183 --> 36:26.818
<i>We must move swiftly.</i>

36:26.818 --> 36:28.954
<i>Take courage, Jacqueline.</i>

36:31.323 --> 36:33.458
<i>I'll come to you tonight
under the pretense</i>

36:33.458 --> 36:35.227
<i>of discussing the orphanage.</i>

36:35.227 --> 36:38.630
<i>Ensure your husband joins us.</i>

36:41.366 --> 36:45.337
While we talk, have your maid
take Odette to the carriage.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.673
<i>Tell her you plan
to surprise Henri</i>

36:47.673 --> 36:49.341
<i>with a ride to see
the fireworks</i>

36:49.341 --> 36:50.742
<i>before leaving for Versailles.</i>

36:50.742 --> 36:52.611
I'm to wait
for your reply, madame.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.379
Thank you.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.960
<i>I'll leave
first by carriage</i>

37:07.960 --> 37:09.828
<i>with your maid and Odette.</i>

37:09.828 --> 37:11.663
<i>I'll reveal our plan
to the maid</i>

37:11.663 --> 37:13.932
<i>and pay for her silence.</i>

37:13.932 --> 37:17.302
<i>After half an hour,
make an excuse to Henri</i>

37:17.302 --> 37:20.739
<i>and come to meet us
at the Place des Vosges.</i>

37:20.739 --> 37:24.543
<i>I'll be waiting there
with the child.</i>

37:24.543 --> 37:26.745
<i>Give my boy your answer.</i>

37:26.745 --> 37:29.247
<i>Will we take our courage,
Jacqueline?</i>

37:32.851 --> 37:35.287
Tell him, boy.

37:35.287 --> 37:36.722
Tell him yes.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.724
Yes. Yes.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.779
Come.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.915
I'm glad it's you.
I wanted to see you.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.651
You have a visitor.

38:05.651 --> 38:08.353
A matter of some urgency, apparently.

38:08.353 --> 38:09.788
Boy.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.336
Azolan?

38:24.336 --> 38:26.571
What are you doing here?

38:26.571 --> 38:29.908
I, um, asked
first for Victoire,

38:29.908 --> 38:32.010
but the man said she was gone.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.745
You have a message
for Victoire?

38:33.745 --> 38:36.448
I'll see she gets it.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.582
How?

38:37.582 --> 38:39.084
Since she's left you.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.488
Well, she has not left me.

38:43.488 --> 38:45.357
We've simply quarreled.

38:45.357 --> 38:47.693
She'll be back soon.

38:52.464 --> 38:53.832
Take this for me.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.501
It will make my departure
less noticeable.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.874
My master says
you're not to come tonight.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.477
He's better off as Lucienne.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.612
All you do is make him unhappy.

39:07.612 --> 39:09.648
None of what you say is true.

39:09.648 --> 39:13.118
He is Valmont, not Lucienne.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.987
I know it will be hard
for you to share him,

39:15.987 --> 39:19.057
but we love each other,
so let's us, you and I,

39:19.057 --> 39:20.659
begin on good terms.

39:23.895 --> 39:26.465
You may start
with taking my bag.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.838
Tell Pascal I will see him
at 8:00, as agreed.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.652
<i>What girl?</i>

39:47.652 --> 39:49.888
Camille.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.557
She demands that I return
the title or she'll...

39:55.794 --> 39:56.928
Hmm?

39:58.430 --> 39:59.865
She'll ruin me.

40:05.871 --> 40:10.509
I have a life I keep
from CÃ©cile,

40:10.509 --> 40:12.110
from everyone.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.546
<i>Certain liaisons
that would be damaging</i>

40:14.546 --> 40:16.915
<i>to a match such as ours.</i>

40:16.915 --> 40:20.452
And this woman,

40:20.452 --> 40:22.754
Camille--

40:22.754 --> 40:24.556
she knows about these liaisons?

40:27.893 --> 40:29.561
<i>I know
all you've done for me,</i>

40:29.561 --> 40:31.129
<i>how you set up this match
and everything</i>

40:31.129 --> 40:33.532
<i>to secure my future.</i>

40:33.532 --> 40:34.733
Forgive me.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.769
You think I don't know
every facet of you?

40:37.769 --> 40:40.138
You don't need
forgiveness for that.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.474
If she is trying
to destroy you,

40:42.474 --> 40:43.909
she'll have
to destroy me first,

40:43.909 --> 40:45.443
and she'll find out
she doesn't know

40:45.443 --> 40:47.479
the meaning of the word!

41:03.995 --> 41:05.797
Madame.

41:16.608 --> 41:17.876
The marquis will see you now.

41:31.156 --> 41:35.193
I believe I've finally seen
your mysterious fiancÃ©e.

41:35.193 --> 41:37.929
She's not your business.

41:37.929 --> 41:40.532
Everything to do with you
is my business.

41:42.267 --> 41:45.503
A man of mine is fishing
Ariadnes from the Seine

41:45.503 --> 41:47.873
<i>and making connections
between them.</i>

41:47.873 --> 41:49.975
<i>I've closed up the club,
but he will not look away</i>

41:49.975 --> 41:51.710
<i>for long.</i>

41:51.710 --> 41:53.712
Then approach the duc.

41:56.047 --> 41:59.584
You know very well one
does not approach the duc.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.086
One serves him.

42:01.086 --> 42:03.255
And his appetite
must be sated in another way,

42:03.255 --> 42:04.756
from a source
beyond the Labyrinth.

42:04.756 --> 42:07.192
<i>So you do your duty, Marquis.</i>

42:07.192 --> 42:09.227
Find a girl
who leaves no trace.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.734
<i>It's Camille, isn't it?</i>

42:19.004 --> 42:21.006
No one can tell me
a thing about her,

42:21.006 --> 42:24.042
who she is, where she's from.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.011
She leaves no trace.

42:30.081 --> 42:31.683
<i>I'll do nothing more.</i>

42:36.121 --> 42:38.290
You'll do
whatever's asked of you.

43:49.694 --> 43:52.664
Monsieur de Montrachet,

43:52.664 --> 43:55.367
it is a pleasure
to finally meet you.

43:55.367 --> 43:58.036
I congratulate you
on your position with the king.

44:00.338 --> 44:03.942
I understand you are to help
lighten our pockets

44:03.942 --> 44:07.278
before we go to Versailles.

44:07.278 --> 44:10.782
An orphanage in need
of guardians.

44:10.782 --> 44:12.917
<i>That is fitting.</i>

44:12.917 --> 44:15.720
If we do not care for these
abandoned children, who will?

44:15.720 --> 44:16.921
<i>There is no expectations</i>

44:16.921 --> 44:18.156
<i>of funds, monsieur.</i>

44:18.156 --> 44:21.426
Even your good name connected
with us would...

44:21.659 --> 44:23.962
would make a great difference.

44:23.962 --> 44:25.196
Yes.

44:25.196 --> 44:28.900
I am very protective
of my good name.

44:31.236 --> 44:33.738
Leave the details
of your request with my wife.

44:33.738 --> 44:35.907
We will do what we can
to help you.

44:54.426 --> 44:58.229
Wait, Monsieur.
I have forgotten her blanket.

44:58.229 --> 45:01.032
<i>She cannot be without it.</i>

45:01.032 --> 45:02.233
Go on, then.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.024
Hello, little one.

45:28.293 --> 45:30.428
I am taking you
back to your mother.

45:32.997 --> 45:34.299
Her name is Camille.

45:36.901 --> 45:38.803
<i>And her heart has been
broken since the day</i>

45:38.803 --> 45:40.038
<i>you were stolen from her.</i>

45:45.110 --> 45:48.246
But now, her heart will mend.

45:48.246 --> 45:52.150
You will be more loved
than you could ever be.

46:02.894 --> 46:04.896
You have not
brought the blanket.

46:04.896 --> 46:06.798
Well, she does not
need it after all.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.401
<i>Take him away.</i>

46:43.401 --> 46:45.537
<i>Very well, sir.</i>

47:05.023 --> 47:06.391
Your loyalty will be rewarded.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.306
Valmont!

48:22.133 --> 48:23.468
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

48:32.243 --> 48:33.978
Where is he?

48:33.978 --> 48:36.281
As always,
when one needs him most,

48:36.281 --> 48:38.149
he cannot be relied upon.

48:44.322 --> 48:45.390
Curse that man.

48:45.390 --> 48:47.692
He promised me
a story for my opera.

48:47.925 --> 48:51.129
What story did he promise you?

48:51.129 --> 48:53.498
One about his immorality,

48:53.498 --> 48:56.200
about the passion
between men and women.

48:56.200 --> 49:00.104
<i>Not really my forte.</i>

49:00.104 --> 49:03.308
The opera is tomorrow night,
and you are not finished?

49:03.308 --> 49:06.377
On the contrary,
I am entirely finished

49:06.377 --> 49:08.546
in Paris and beyond.

49:08.546 --> 49:10.248
It's better I fake my death.

49:10.248 --> 49:13.184
It will increase the fondness
of others for my work.

49:14.118 --> 49:16.621
Why did I believe
Valmont could save me?

49:19.190 --> 49:21.359
Because he needs us to believe.

49:28.032 --> 49:31.636
It fills the great, dark abyss

49:31.636 --> 49:33.638
we mistake for his heart.

49:44.582 --> 49:47.518
I have a story
for you, Chevalier.

49:47.518 --> 49:50.188
Come, sit with me.

50:01.132 --> 50:02.633
Close your eyes and listen.

50:07.171 --> 50:10.775
Once upon a time,
there was an orphan girl.

50:19.150 --> 50:23.788
<i>Friends, this will be
our last gathering in Paris.</i>

50:24.021 --> 50:27.625
<i>We sought to bring healing,
but this city</i>

50:27.625 --> 50:30.161
<i>is not ready for our work.</i>

50:30.161 --> 50:33.364
<i>It is not you,
the people, who resist us.</i>

50:33.364 --> 50:36.768
<i>But too much is rotten here
and cannot be saved.</i>

50:36.768 --> 50:40.104
The elite seek to maintain
an old poison.

50:40.104 --> 50:41.773
They seek to shut out
the light.

50:41.773 --> 50:44.275
But they are not
the masters of our souls.

50:44.275 --> 50:46.544
<i>So cast off this darkness.</i>

50:46.544 --> 50:49.714
Burn all that you do not need

50:49.714 --> 50:53.084
and come to the light.

50:53.084 --> 50:54.252
Come.

50:54.252 --> 50:56.087
Come, this side.

50:56.087 --> 50:58.456
<i>A new time is coming,
a time</i>

50:58.456 --> 51:01.359
<i>when darkness
will be driven out.</i>

51:01.359 --> 51:02.527
<i>Come to the light.</i>

51:02.527 --> 51:05.229
<i>Bring all those
who need the light.</i>

51:05.229 --> 51:06.798
<i>Burn your shackles.</i>

51:06.798 --> 51:08.633
Embrace your future

51:08.633 --> 51:10.568
<i>and welcome.</i>

51:10.568 --> 51:13.204
Come.

51:13.204 --> 51:15.173
<i>Take your place at the end.</i>

51:15.173 --> 51:17.074
<i>Take hold of the rope.</i>

51:17.074 --> 51:21.579
<i>Let us make new plans
for a new world!</i>

51:21.579 --> 51:25.383
<i>There is nothing left
here for a good soul.</i>

51:25.383 --> 51:30.354
<i>Intrepid souls,
embrace your future!</i>

51:30.354 --> 51:33.391
<i>There is no hope here!</i>

51:39.797 --> 51:42.700
That is your <i>Opera of Paris.</i>

51:43.868 --> 51:46.304
That is who these people are.

51:51.309 --> 51:55.213
I'm grateful to you, mademoiselle.

51:55.213 --> 51:57.748
I have a long night
and day ahead,

51:57.748 --> 52:00.218
but now, I may actually have
an opera

52:00.218 --> 52:02.153
that satisfies our queen.

52:06.624 --> 52:09.260
He does not deserve you--
Valmont.

52:10.528 --> 52:13.731
And you
are better off without him.

52:22.740 --> 52:24.876
Send for your priest.

52:41.626 --> 52:43.828
<i>In nomine Patri</i>

52:43.828 --> 52:47.465
<i>et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

53:19.697 --> 53:21.732
Take me to the opera
tomorrow night.

53:24.635 --> 53:26.337
I don't care for the opera.

53:26.337 --> 53:29.874
But you care for me.

53:29.874 --> 53:34.512
It's what I want.

53:34.512 --> 53:37.949
I want all of Paris
to know who I am.

53:37.949 --> 53:39.850
And who is that?

53:42.753 --> 53:45.523
The Marquise de Merteuil,

53:45.523 --> 53:49.894
your wife,

53:49.894 --> 53:52.597
one of the most powerful women
in this city.

53:52.597 --> 53:56.000
No, one of the most
powerful women in France.

54:04.675 --> 54:07.244
Do you know the thing
about power, Marquise?

54:09.013 --> 54:11.549
<i>It corrupts
all those that have it.</i>

54:15.252 --> 54:17.421
Can you imagine what
that does to the soul?

54:25.363 --> 54:27.465
Makes you capable
of anything.

54:28.966 --> 54:30.768
Yes.

55:43.407 --> 55:45.643
<i>It's you?
Oh, my luck.</i>

55:49.447 --> 55:50.648
My...

55:54.485 --> 55:58.723
M-m-my

55:58.723 --> 56:03.728
da-darling

56:03.728 --> 56:08.466
Va-l-mo--

56:08.466 --> 56:12.403
my darling Valmont.

57:52.837 --> 57:54.104
It's all right, child.

57:54.705 --> 57:56.974
Stay-stay aw...
stay away from me.
