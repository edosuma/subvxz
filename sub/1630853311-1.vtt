WEBVTT

01:10.362 --> 01:15.159
THE BIG RACKET

03:02.516 --> 03:07.146
Oh, my God.
Look at this mess.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.064
They've wrecked the place.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.858
Those delinquents. Look!

03:10.983 --> 03:12.776
Look at that! What about this?

03:12.902 --> 03:14.570
They left this behind. Here we go.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.488
Mother of God, I'm ruined.

03:16.614 --> 03:19.533
Yeah, but you're right,
you can't turn them in.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.160
Turn them in?

03:21.285 --> 03:23.954
What are you talking about?
Are you crazy?

03:24.079 --> 03:29.460
If you turn those guys in, they'll return
and set alight to the place.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.796
But… we'll protect you.

03:32.922 --> 03:34.423
You can rest easy.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.633
Just pay us.

03:35.758 --> 03:38.594
You can't pay by draft,
we only accept cash.

03:39.345 --> 03:42.097
Yesterday someone came by
and you told them to call again.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.599
So I'm the collector.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.393
Please.
I don't have that much money.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.937
Very well.

03:48.604 --> 03:49.980
It doesn't matter.

03:50.105 --> 03:53.275
What's the address here?
38, Piazza Navona, right?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.819
I'll send someone to help you
with the renovations.

03:55.945 --> 03:58.530
Know what they did
to a colleague of yours?

03:59.323 --> 04:03.035
They went in after hours.
She was all alone, the poor thing.

04:03.160 --> 04:07.915
They made her drink two bottles of perfume
and squeezed three tubes of cream up her…

04:08.624 --> 04:11.251
Well, you can imagine.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.923
I'm ashamed to say it.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.304
One hundred.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.058
You're going to ruin me.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.686
Look, be reasonable. You tell him.

04:28.811 --> 04:32.147
I hardly make ends meet as it is.
One hundred a week is too much.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.609
- Is this the kind that pisses?
- Yes, the latest model that sings too.

04:35.734 --> 04:39.780
Just count the money,
or we'll make you sing.

04:40.864 --> 04:44.243
- How come she has no tits?
- Listen to me, please…

04:44.368 --> 04:46.245
I'm an old man. I've got a family.

04:46.370 --> 04:51.083
I value my life, but give me some time.
Where am I going to find that money?

04:51.208 --> 04:54.712
See this?
If you don't pay, you'll end up like her!

04:54.837 --> 04:57.047
You won't even have
any eyes to weep with.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.800
<i>Oh, my God! That's gross.</i>

04:59.925 --> 05:04.471
Look at that whore
with her bits in plain sight!

05:04.596 --> 05:07.850
What are you doing? Stop!
Are you out of your mind?

05:16.191 --> 05:18.986
You don't want to piss that guy off.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.030
Look at that face.

05:21.155 --> 05:24.700
You'd better pay him every week.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.830
Nicola, what are we waiting for?

05:32.916 --> 05:34.001
Let's wait.

05:34.126 --> 05:38.297
- God, I'm feeling sick.
- He's feeling sick!

05:38.422 --> 05:40.007
The food was poisoned.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.385
- Let's get out of here.
- Take him to the hospital.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.512
Quick! He needs his stomach pumped!

05:46.764 --> 05:48.098
It's okay. It's nothing.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.561
Get out of here, Stefania!

05:52.686 --> 05:54.772
Don't listen to them.
Nothing happened.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.025
It's a joke.
What are you doing, you bastards?

05:58.150 --> 06:00.277
Let go of me.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.782
Let me go, for Christ's sake!

06:05.532 --> 06:07.618
- Well?
- Knock it off!

06:07.743 --> 06:12.039
So you've been poisoning people?
Look at this poor man. He's sick.

06:12.164 --> 06:16.210
Are you going to pay us,
or are we doing things the hard way?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.089
But I can't.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.382
Take out a mortgage
and pay a one-time fee.

06:22.508 --> 06:25.594
- Sure. Good idea.
- Impossible. I work alone here.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.138
Poor man, he's all alone.
We're so mean.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.351
Look who's here.

06:32.476 --> 06:35.479
Who's that, then, your daughter?

06:35.604 --> 06:37.189
She's cute.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.108
Pretty little girl.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.236
- So?
- Pretty… and good.

06:42.361 --> 06:46.156
She does well at home and in school
like old-time girls.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.117
- Easy.
- Don't you touch her!

06:48.242 --> 06:51.328
No one's touching her.
Don't you see I'm on the job?

06:52.246 --> 06:55.499
It would be such a shame
if someone did something to her.

06:55.624 --> 06:59.920
Yes, that'd be a shame.
So, when can we call again?

07:03.841 --> 07:06.218
- In one week.
- What?

07:06.885 --> 07:08.512
- In one week.
- That's better.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.222
In a week.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.810
Good boy.
I like you because you're reasonable.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.857
Your daughter is not bad at all.

07:19.982 --> 07:25.279
Be careful. If you go to the cops,
you're going to give me a hard-on.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.240
Bye, kiddo.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.510
- What was that about?
- Looking for a wife?

07:48.635 --> 07:51.430
I hope he won't pay,
so I can take care of his daughter.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.908
About time.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.704
How much?

09:09.466 --> 09:11.301
Don't mess with me.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.431
I'm not messing with you.
What are you talking about?

09:16.556 --> 09:19.226
- That's all we've got.
- I hope that's true.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.025
Who did you bring with you?

09:29.027 --> 09:31.196
- Why?
- That car followed you.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.407
Don't turn around, dickhead.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.767
Fuck you!

10:00.892 --> 10:03.854
Where do you think you're going,
you son of a bitch?

10:03.979 --> 10:06.064
You faggot!

10:17.200 --> 10:19.703
Murderer! You're a rat!

11:32.067 --> 11:34.611
Sergeant Palmieri,
someone's here to see you.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.822
- This way, sir.
- Thank you.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.743
That's what you get
for going hunting alone.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.371
When are you going to stop doing that?

11:44.496 --> 11:49.251
Look, if that's all you came here to say,
you should've saved yourself the trouble.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.753
- Really?
- Pass me my cigarettes.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.088
Sure.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.340
Here. And your lighter.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.262
They really beat the daylights out of you.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.722
Don't worry, I'll lock them all up.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.350
- All of them.
- What's the point?

12:05.851 --> 12:08.353
Without any evidence,
they'll be out in two days.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.231
- Right. I know.
- I'm after their boss.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.484
Here's the sketch you prepared.

12:14.609 --> 12:18.155
We've been working on it,
but we've had no luck so far.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.615
- What about the informers?
- They won't talk.

12:21.450 --> 12:24.536
He must be a son of a bitch
from out of town.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.912
From where?

12:26.037 --> 12:28.540
What do you mean?
They come from all over the world.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.461
South America, Yugoslavia, Germany.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.006
This place is up for grabs.

12:36.131 --> 12:39.426
- Inspector, headquarters is on the line.
- I'll be right there.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.763
Listen, tell Salvatore
to keep following the Tuscan.

12:43.889 --> 12:47.100
<i>- The Tuscan?
- He'll know. He's their errand boy.</i>

12:47.225 --> 12:49.269
<i>We found out about the racket
by following him.</i>

12:49.394 --> 12:52.022
<i>Okay, I'll tell him.
And I'll keep you informed.</i>

12:52.147 --> 12:54.191
<i>- Break a leg!
- Very funny.</i>

13:21.092 --> 13:24.721
Look who's here.
Calimero, the black jackass!

13:26.348 --> 13:29.351
PRIVATE CUSTOMS
WAREHOUSE No. 62

13:35.941 --> 13:39.194
Stop! Up against the wall!

13:41.071 --> 13:43.740
So much for our Tuscan lead.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.786
- What else could I do?
- Any news from the shopkeepers?

13:47.911 --> 13:49.371
No, nothing.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.415
I'm not surprised. They're afraid.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.877
You should be afraid too.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.297
If you keep straining that leg,
you'll risk ending up a cripple.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.799
Look.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.970
- See? I'm going to…
- What are you doing?

14:05.095 --> 14:07.681
In two days, I'll be out of here.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.225
Are you crazy?

14:45.594 --> 14:49.973
This is the second time they've wrecked
your place. Who was it?

14:50.098 --> 14:51.516
I don't know.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.060
Did you tell the police?

14:54.185 --> 14:57.188
The police, right.
Why do you care anyway?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.482
Listen…

15:00.775 --> 15:04.529
Have you been paying them?
I mean, protection money.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.616
- I don't pay anybody.
- Well, you should.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.413
What if something happened to you?

15:14.039 --> 15:16.625
How about 300,000 a month?
You'll rest easy that way.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.834
Three hundred…?

15:18.460 --> 15:21.254
Three hundred thousand lira?
I've already paid 200,000.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.089
I gave the money to a small guy.

15:23.214 --> 15:27.260
Tell me more about it at the station.
Ask for Sergeant Palmieri.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.055
Holy shit.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.891
What the hell's going on?

15:33.975 --> 15:37.062
See you at the station at six.
And don't be late.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.396
Yes, sir.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.696
And two cutlets.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.826
I've already told you.
Just leave me alone.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.499
I didn't see anyone.
I'm not turning anyone in.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.210
What will your daughter think of you?

16:01.044 --> 16:06.216
That you're a poor wretch?
A coward? A rat?

16:06.341 --> 16:08.677
- You bastard!
- Daddy!

16:10.303 --> 16:13.056
- What are you doing?
- You insulted an officer. Let's go.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.516
Come on.

16:16.851 --> 16:19.312
What's going on?
Where are they taking you?

16:19.437 --> 16:23.483
It's okay, it's nothing.
Don't worry. It's nothing.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.652
Daddy will be back soon.

16:25.777 --> 16:29.364
- Out of the way! Let us through!
- Stand back!

16:31.533 --> 16:33.076
What the hell? Unbelievable!

16:33.201 --> 16:34.202
Daddy!

16:34.327 --> 16:37.080
You're going to need a good lawyer.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.749
Leave the man alone.
He wouldn't hurt a fly!

16:42.293 --> 16:45.505
Nicola?
Can I say something?

16:46.673 --> 16:49.384
That was a stupid thing to do,
arresting this poor man.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.344
You shouldn't have done that.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.180
Those guys are keeping an eye
on the place.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.391
If I hadn't arrested him,
he'd have got into trouble.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.895
- What?
- You didn't think of that, did you?

17:02.439 --> 17:04.607
Salvatore, pull over.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.322
Get out. You're free to go.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.701
If you feel like it,
come to the station at 6:30.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.414
Now go.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.425
They caused me two million in damage.
I was lucky.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.886
- You wouldn't believe the threats.
- It's a disgrace.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.971
- Let's hope…
- They're criminals.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.308
I understand the shopkeepers
not wanting to talk.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.977
They're fucking scared.
Why would they?

17:41.102 --> 17:43.480
- I don't blame them.
- Me neither.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.900
They tried to talk
to the police chief, to the mayor,

17:47.025 --> 17:48.943
but nothing happened.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.781
Hey, Nico, listen…

17:53.323 --> 17:56.409
They don't trust us anymore.
They told me in not so many words.

17:56.534 --> 17:57.952
"What are the police doing?"

17:58.077 --> 18:01.831
We can't possibly
protect them all 24/7.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.334
They saw their faces, right?

18:04.459 --> 18:07.420
We need a formal report,
otherwise there's nothing we can do.

18:07.545 --> 18:10.340
- Our hands are tied.
- A formal report?

18:10.465 --> 18:13.218
Put yourself in their shoes.
That would be too dangerous.

18:14.469 --> 18:17.514
I closed my shop to come here.
I can't just sit around all day.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.557
Calm down, ma'am. Be patient.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.525
Earlier today in front of my daughter…

18:29.526 --> 18:31.361
… you called me a coward.

18:32.737 --> 18:36.908
I didn't mean it when I said it,
and I don't mean it now.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.620
No, you're right.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.082
A man who's not able
to defend himself…

18:45.625 --> 18:47.460
… is not a man.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.296
You know…

18:51.297 --> 18:53.424
… they threatened me.

18:53.550 --> 18:57.095
They said to me,
"Pay up or close down."

18:58.888 --> 19:01.015
How would I make a living?

19:02.517 --> 19:05.270
I only have one daughter
who wants to study.

19:07.313 --> 19:13.903
A father who's not even able to give
his children what he didn't have

19:14.529 --> 19:16.197
is good for nothing.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.119
I'm here to help you.

19:21.244 --> 19:24.789
- Do you know how risky that is?
- Yes, I do.

19:24.914 --> 19:29.002
I discussed this with my daughter.
She agreed.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.921
I'll send her to boarding school.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.257
That's the first thing you need to do.

19:36.301 --> 19:39.554
Thank you so much in advance
for your cooperation.

19:39.679 --> 19:43.683
I hope to catch them red-handed,
I don't want you to take any more risks.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.226
Thanks again.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.952
You're carrying a gun? Asshole!

20:05.330 --> 20:08.082
Get him up! Get him up!

20:08.207 --> 20:11.210
- So you won't pay up?
- Give me the gasoline.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.255
Here's your bill.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.798
Come here.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.468
Come on. I'll hold him.

20:18.593 --> 20:22.055
What are you having?
A very nice Florentine belt!

20:22.847 --> 20:25.391
- You piece of garbage!
- A Bolognese punch.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.394
Fried batter topped with Parmesan.

20:28.519 --> 20:32.106
There, the customer's been served.
It'll be an expensive bill.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.902
Don't pass out yet.
You still haven't ordered dessert.

20:36.027 --> 20:41.324
And the crêpe Suzette is on me, guys.
Nice and hot!

20:41.449 --> 20:43.368
Pile up those chairs.

20:44.869 --> 20:49.832
- Fire!
- Burn, burn, burn!

20:53.962 --> 20:55.922
- What a smell.
- Indeed.

20:56.673 --> 20:59.092
- Is it gasoline?
- Yes, it's gasoline.

20:59.217 --> 21:03.221
- What a waste. It's so expensive.
- Holy crap.

21:03.346 --> 21:06.140
We've met before, haven't we?
Am I wrong?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.810
Yes, when you had that car accident.

21:08.935 --> 21:12.647
- I only got a scratch.
- Right, it could've been worse.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.985
What are you doing?
Cleaning the place?

21:17.110 --> 21:19.737
You want me to clean you too, huh?

21:19.862 --> 21:23.908
- Hey, what's he doing?
- He just drank too much.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.452
These beers are pretty strong, Sergeant.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.204
Offer the sergeant a beer.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.257
You filthy rat.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.010
Rat!

22:17.295 --> 22:20.506
Hey… what are you going to do?

22:21.340 --> 22:24.260
Well? Make a formal complaint?

22:25.803 --> 22:27.805
What are you talking about?

22:28.306 --> 22:30.725
- I just slipped.
- You slipped?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.019
I have no choice.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.400
Do you know this guy?

22:40.276 --> 22:43.821
Write everything down.
They're going to tell us a lot.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.449
Look at this guy.
Do you take orders from him?

22:47.408 --> 22:48.868
I don't know him.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.287
It's Rudy the Marseillais.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.498
You give the money to him.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.166
Never seen him.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.960
You're giving me a hard-on!

22:59.378 --> 23:00.963
What about you, Countess?

23:01.089 --> 23:03.508
He's handsome.
Will you introduce me to him?

23:03.633 --> 23:05.051
Yes, soon.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.678
And you?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.099
Me? Don't know him.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.018
Try asking…

23:15.645 --> 23:18.856
Damn you! Son of a bitch.

23:18.981 --> 23:23.569
My lawyer! This guy is crazy!
He's beating the shit out of me!

23:23.694 --> 23:26.823
Shut up and cut the crap.
Sit down with the others.

23:27.532 --> 23:28.950
I said, sit down.

23:29.075 --> 23:32.328
- Look at this!
- Palmieri, have you lost your mind?

23:32.453 --> 23:34.247
Don't tell me you believe them?

23:34.372 --> 23:38.584
He said to me, "Either you put out,
or you'll end up in jail."

23:38.709 --> 23:42.088
We were just having a beer,
when he came in and started beating us.

23:42.213 --> 23:45.174
He came with 12 others
and they all started beating us.

23:45.299 --> 23:49.095
- He was there too.
- Shut up! What are you saying?

23:49.220 --> 23:52.390
I thought such methods
had been abandoned.

23:52.515 --> 23:56.435
You can't question people
without a judge and a lawyer.

23:56.561 --> 23:58.646
Salvatore, keep them quiet, please!

24:00.064 --> 24:04.026
I was just asking them who this guy is.
Will you tell me, Mr. Lawyer?

24:04.152 --> 24:07.488
- Do you have a detailed report?
- Yes, the sergeant's writing it up.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.365
He will write what you tell him to.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.450
What will you charge them with?
Drunkenness?

24:11.576 --> 24:14.912
- I'm charging them with racketeering.
- Where's your proof?

24:15.746 --> 24:18.875
Will you shut those bastards up?

24:19.000 --> 24:22.336
- What's your evidence?
- You need proof, Sergeant Palmieri.

24:23.171 --> 24:26.007
- Well?
- I have a witness.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.596
A shopkeeper who was blackmailed
by these sons of bitches.

24:31.721 --> 24:34.640
I just didn't want him to run any risks.

24:34.765 --> 24:37.143
The others are terrified.
They won't talk.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.771
No one else is willing to cooperate.

24:40.897 --> 24:43.232
That's why I have
to be cautious. That's all.

25:15.014 --> 25:18.434
- Do you recognize them?
- Yes, it's them.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.730
Will you agree to sign the report?

25:22.855 --> 25:26.359
But if you make him sign,
they'll want revenge.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.778
I get it, but I can't accept
anonymous reports.

25:28.903 --> 25:32.031
But you can see, he recognized them.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.908
Never mind that, Sergeant.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.748
I made a decision
to see this through, and I will.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.503
Prepare the report and I'll sign it.

25:49.757 --> 25:53.844
You should have seen them.
The nuns believed me.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.471
"Of course, here's the girl."

25:55.596 --> 26:00.268
They were so kind.
"Sister, bring the little girl back soon."

26:00.393 --> 26:04.563
And the girl thought
we'd be taking her for a ride.

26:04.689 --> 26:09.110
"Of course, take her to her father.
Poor man. Are you sure he's dying?"

26:09.235 --> 26:12.238
"Yes, please, Sister.
I need to take the girl back to her dad."

26:12.363 --> 26:15.533
Aren't you the woman who came
to my dad's restaurant a while ago?

26:15.658 --> 26:17.827
Yes, that's me.

26:17.952 --> 26:21.622
So you remember me.
You'll see what's going to happen to you.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.958
Something you've never
experienced before.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.294
Keep her quiet! Keep her quiet!

26:26.419 --> 26:28.129
You little bitch!

26:47.315 --> 26:49.608
- Finally!
- About time.

26:49.734 --> 26:52.611
Hey, where are you going?
Don't run away!

26:52.737 --> 26:54.196
Get back here!

26:54.322 --> 26:57.908
Where are you running to?
You're my girlfriend now!

26:59.160 --> 27:00.619
Let me go!

27:02.121 --> 27:04.332
Let go of me!

27:07.168 --> 27:08.544
Let me go!

27:13.799 --> 27:15.343
Let me go!

27:15.468 --> 27:18.137
Look at the little virgin's panties!

27:20.639 --> 27:22.099
Let me go!

29:01.157 --> 29:05.494
What the hell did you do?
The shopkeepers filed a report.

29:05.619 --> 29:08.038
They accused you
of putting them at risk.

29:08.164 --> 29:09.999
That's absurd.

29:10.124 --> 29:13.419
- Someone obviously told them to.
- It's possible.

29:13.544 --> 29:16.130
The Public Prosecutor
is being brought into this.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.923
The Public Prosecutor?

29:21.677 --> 29:23.095
Great job!

29:24.638 --> 29:27.933
Now they'll cover it all up
and regroup.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.854
All my work will have been for nothing.

29:31.979 --> 29:34.315
Work?
It was all beating and shooting.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.193
We can't use the same methods
that criminals use.

29:37.318 --> 29:40.070
Cops are supposed to respect the law.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.822
And have people file reports.

29:41.947 --> 29:45.451
People like that poor man
who signed his own sentence?

29:45.576 --> 29:47.369
That's on you.

29:47.495 --> 29:52.583
Palmieri, the judge doesn't like
your methods, so…

29:52.708 --> 29:55.794
… so he's decided
to take you off the case.

30:04.428 --> 30:05.846
Of course.

30:07.598 --> 30:10.392
- You need someone to blame.
- What are you saying?

30:10.518 --> 30:13.062
- Can I go?
- Yes, go.

30:20.945 --> 30:24.949
Unfortunately, excessive zeal is harmful.
It needs to be stopped in time.

30:39.964 --> 30:41.632
Hey, Nicola, I was just…

30:41.757 --> 30:44.301
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

30:44.426 --> 30:48.597
They took me off the case, huh?
The prosecutor will investigate.

30:48.722 --> 30:51.058
Ask someone to take
this fucking cast off!

30:51.183 --> 30:55.020
Calm down! One false move,
and we'll all end up in Sardinia.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.564
Don't you get it?

30:56.689 --> 30:59.316
At least we'd be in Sardinia
for a reason.

30:59.441 --> 31:00.901
Hurry up!

31:20.796 --> 31:22.381
Hey, how are you doing?

31:22.506 --> 31:24.174
- This is Denise.
- Nice to meet you.

31:24.925 --> 31:28.053
- Mazzarelli!
- Excuse me.

31:34.768 --> 31:37.521
Sit down. Please.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.691
Have a seat.

31:52.953 --> 31:55.205
So do we have a deal?

31:55.331 --> 31:58.626
A deal? What deal?

31:59.418 --> 32:03.839
I don't make deals with you two.
What do you want?

32:03.964 --> 32:08.302
Alright, Mazzarelli,
if you don't pay, we'll blow this club up.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.720
What did you just say?

32:09.845 --> 32:14.266
If you don't leave immediately,
I'll drag you out by the ears.

32:15.059 --> 32:17.519
- Anything wrong?
- Is he bothering you?

32:21.023 --> 32:22.691
They're good guys.

32:24.318 --> 32:25.819
Aren't you?

32:31.116 --> 32:32.993
What were you saying?

32:37.539 --> 32:40.167
Well, shall we go?

32:41.043 --> 32:43.420
We don't give a damn about your club.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.674
How much money do you make
with the stuff?

32:47.299 --> 32:49.093
The stuff? What stuff?

32:49.218 --> 32:52.513
I don't have anything
to do with the stuff.

32:53.222 --> 32:57.935
Mazzarelli, you're even more confusing
than the news.

32:58.060 --> 32:59.937
Shall we split fifty-fifty?

33:00.062 --> 33:02.314
What? Fifty-fifty?

33:02.439 --> 33:04.566
Fifty-fifty, my ass!

33:05.067 --> 33:08.320
You're right.
That would be too much.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.906
We'll take everything.

33:13.409 --> 33:16.912
Hey, Nico. This is Salvatore.
I'm following the gang.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.581
They have Mazzarelli,
from the gambling den.

33:19.707 --> 33:23.085
I don't think he's enjoying the ride.
What do I do? Over.

33:23.210 --> 33:26.338
<i>I'll be right there.
What's your location?</i>

33:48.777 --> 33:50.446
Where is it?

33:58.454 --> 34:00.205
Come on. Move it!

34:00.706 --> 34:02.750
Don't push me. Go to hell!

34:02.875 --> 34:04.918
- Got a bug up your ass?
- Cut the crap!

34:05.043 --> 34:06.712
Unbelievable.

34:17.514 --> 34:20.726
What the fuck! Look at this.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.312
You gotta be kidding me.

34:23.437 --> 34:26.148
Hey, Nico.
I'm at the docks in Fiumicino.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.233
Mazzarelli delivered some package.

34:28.358 --> 34:32.654
<i>- I'm sure this is about drugs.</i>
- I'm on my way.

34:32.780 --> 34:36.033
<i>- Alright. Come quick.</i>
- Stay where you are. I'll be right there.

34:40.579 --> 34:41.914
It's good.

34:42.915 --> 34:44.917
It comes from Marseille.

34:47.461 --> 34:49.713
So you screwed me. Happy now?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.507
Because we're good.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.385
Quit breaking my balls.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.721
I haven't even started yet.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.351
Asshole!

35:03.560 --> 35:05.103
Pig!

35:05.229 --> 35:06.647
Faggot!

35:06.772 --> 35:08.607
She's a lady.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.524
There it is!

36:46.663 --> 36:49.249
Vela 21 to Doppia Vela.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.794
Send an ambulance to the docks
in Fiumicino immediately. Over.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.796
Take care of them too.

37:02.346 --> 37:04.056
Look who's here.

37:04.181 --> 37:05.599
Mazzarelli.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.519
The king of gambling houses
and night clubs.

37:14.066 --> 37:16.193
- Hello, Sergeant.
- Hi.

37:17.486 --> 37:20.113
Didn't work out this time, huh?

37:20.238 --> 37:22.324
Who did this to you?

37:26.161 --> 37:29.331
Tell me, or I'll just let you croak
like a dog.

37:29.456 --> 37:32.834
Nico, you seem to enjoy
acting like a beast,

37:32.960 --> 37:35.879
but compared to those guys,
you're just a dove.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.842
Where do drugs fit in
with racketeering?

37:45.055 --> 37:47.933
Are you giving them drugs
instead of protection money?

37:48.058 --> 37:49.893
Who's Rudy the Marseillais?

37:50.018 --> 37:51.687
- Who does he work for?
- That guy?

37:51.812 --> 37:56.525
He's working with people
who want to make us spit blood.

37:56.650 --> 37:59.152
They'll make you spit blood too.

37:59.277 --> 38:03.073
Listen to me. I need names.
Who's behind them?

38:03.198 --> 38:07.703
Nico, if I'm going to die,
what's the point in being a snitch?

38:08.453 --> 38:13.875
But if I live…
we'll gut them together.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.547
Call an ambulance, will you?

38:20.549 --> 38:22.300
It's on its way.

38:22.426 --> 38:23.844
Good.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.099
So, do you have the money?

38:29.224 --> 38:31.476
We're here to collect it.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.395
The money?

38:33.520 --> 38:35.814
After what you did to my daughter?

38:35.939 --> 38:38.984
Who gives a fuck about your daughter?
Give us the money.

38:40.861 --> 38:42.821
My daughter killed herself.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.406
My condolences.

38:45.532 --> 38:48.702
Come on! Go get the money.
We haven't got all day.

38:52.039 --> 38:55.834
- She killed herself.
- Again? Cut it out!

38:55.959 --> 39:01.757
Because of what you did to her!
Because of what you did!

39:19.691 --> 39:23.695
Did you see that, Stefania?
It's over.

39:25.197 --> 39:26.615
It's over.

39:27.949 --> 39:30.327
No one's ever going to hurt you again.

39:33.872 --> 39:38.043
No one will come and hurt you
any more, Stefania.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.712
No one.

39:42.631 --> 39:46.593
Don't piss me off today.
What are you going to do?

39:46.718 --> 39:48.845
What do you want?
I'm just the manager here.

39:48.970 --> 39:52.724
The manager, my ass.
You paid everybody else but us.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.684
What are you talking about?

39:55.685 --> 39:57.437
So you're not going to pay?

39:57.562 --> 40:00.565
You're paying everybody else but us.
Alright.

40:01.858 --> 40:05.737
I guess we'll come and buy groceries
with some friends.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.989
- Manager, my ass!
- But…

40:12.911 --> 40:14.788
Let's have fun.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.415
Rebel against the dictatorship
of consumption!

40:17.541 --> 40:19.709
The capitalist bourgeoisie
is about to end!

40:23.130 --> 40:25.090
Get out, you bourgeois pigs!

40:35.142 --> 40:38.979
Police? These criminals
are trashing the place.

40:43.984 --> 40:46.903
Nobody move! Stay where you are!

40:47.028 --> 40:50.115
Let's teach a lesson
to these labor exploiters!

40:50.240 --> 40:53.243
Let's destroy everything!

41:23.064 --> 41:26.067
You've no right to do this.
I declare myself a political prisoner.

41:26.193 --> 41:28.403
Take it easy!

41:28.528 --> 41:31.198
These people have nothing
to do with politics.

41:31.323 --> 41:34.826
They say they want order,
but all they want is chaos.

41:36.077 --> 41:39.623
- Political prisoners, my ass!
- Yes, that's what I thought.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.666
Do you think any of them will talk?

41:41.791 --> 41:44.753
- Dunno.
- Give me some hint or names.

41:44.878 --> 41:47.214
I see, Sergeant.

41:47.339 --> 41:50.258
What else could we do? Those people
were smashing up the place.

41:50.383 --> 41:53.053
But if their parents are prepared
to pay for the damage,

41:53.178 --> 41:55.096
let's not make
such a big deal out of it.

41:56.264 --> 41:59.100
- Hello, sir.
- How are you doing?

42:01.269 --> 42:04.231
- We should let the kids go.
- Of course.

42:04.356 --> 42:07.150
- Nothing else we can do.
- Sorry I bothered you.

42:07.275 --> 42:08.860
All lawyers, follow me.

42:08.985 --> 42:11.488
- Lawyers and their clients!
- Hello, Palmieri.

42:11.613 --> 42:12.906
Hello.

42:13.031 --> 42:15.659
What can we accuse them of?
Being young?

42:15.784 --> 42:18.370
Well, being young doesn't mean…

42:18.495 --> 42:19.829
What's wrong?

42:19.955 --> 42:21.706
I've been busting my ass,

42:21.831 --> 42:26.294
I almost got shot in the back,
and now that fucking lawyer…

42:26.419 --> 42:28.755
That means you're on the right track.

42:34.678 --> 42:36.513
What are you doing here?

42:37.514 --> 42:39.891
- Don't you have a lawyer?
- No.

42:40.684 --> 42:43.478
Do you work on your own?

42:43.603 --> 42:44.980
No!

42:46.356 --> 42:48.358
I'll take care of the kid.

42:48.483 --> 42:51.319
Ah, look who's here. Uncle Pepe.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.322
- How are you?
- How are you doing?

42:54.447 --> 42:56.032
Long time no see.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.368
You're not involved in the racket,
are you?

42:58.493 --> 43:01.162
Jesus, Nico.
Is that what you think of me?

43:01.288 --> 43:03.581
I raised that kid. He's my nephew.

43:03.707 --> 43:05.709
My brother's son.

43:05.834 --> 43:09.879
- You didn't teach him your craft?
- My craft? Are you serious?

43:10.005 --> 43:12.632
I make a living like this,
but my craft has no future.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.637
Do you want me to let him go?

43:17.762 --> 43:20.473
I always pay when I ask someone
for a favor.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.184
Of course. That goes without saying.

43:23.310 --> 43:25.770
Do you know anything about the racket?

43:25.895 --> 43:29.399
This is an abuse of power.
I'm going to file a complaint!

43:29.524 --> 43:31.818
See you tomorrow in my office.
The Colosseum.

43:31.943 --> 43:34.154
Your uncle will get you out. Don't worry.

43:34.279 --> 43:36.531
This is an unacceptable abuse!

43:36.656 --> 43:39.367
I know the law better than you do!

43:39.492 --> 43:42.996
I will not be intimidated!
This is not over!

43:43.580 --> 43:47.083
Better than any lawyer, huh?
Get out of here. You're free to go.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.793
- Am I?
- Sure.

43:50.003 --> 43:52.380
Stay away from them.
I don't want to see you here again.

43:52.505 --> 43:54.174
Thank you, Sergeant.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.808
Lovely souvenir.

44:04.726 --> 44:06.394
How are you doing?

44:10.315 --> 44:13.318
Miss, I'd be pleased to…

44:15.028 --> 44:17.822
What the hell, Nico?
That's not funny.

44:18.990 --> 44:20.867
You do this all the time?

44:20.992 --> 44:23.912
What do you mean?
I even give them their IDs back.

44:24.037 --> 44:27.999
Or they wouldn't be able to travel back
to their countries, happy ever after.

44:28.124 --> 44:29.709
- Happy?
- Yes.

44:29.834 --> 44:32.837
They all come to Rome to do penance
and I help them with that.

44:32.962 --> 44:36.341
They pay to atone for their sins,
so the Lord forgives them.

44:36.466 --> 44:38.259
- Right.
- By the way…

44:38.385 --> 44:41.471
Thank you for forgiving my nephew
and letting him go.

44:42.889 --> 44:44.933
He fell in with the wrong crowd.

44:46.184 --> 44:49.145
- Know anything about it?
- It's a serious problem.

44:49.270 --> 44:51.064
New people, big business.

44:51.189 --> 44:55.777
Racketeering used to be about
smuggling, gambling clubs, prostitution.

44:55.902 --> 44:58.405
These days,
they're targeting shopkeepers.

44:58.530 --> 45:02.409
Then they're going to aim higher
at hotels, construction sites, factories.

45:02.534 --> 45:05.495
In another six months,
they'll have the whole city.

45:06.913 --> 45:08.623
- Who are they?
- Good question.

45:08.748 --> 45:14.546
My friend, they're people from Milan,
Marseilles, Sicily, Calabria.

45:14.671 --> 45:18.675
- The scum of the earth.
- You don't know any of them?

45:18.800 --> 45:23.012
I know a few of the underlings
but not the big fish, I'm afraid.

45:23.930 --> 45:25.640
Would you like to be in with them?

45:25.765 --> 45:29.227
Are you kidding, Sergeant?
Not at my age.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.356
I'd have to start from the ground up.

45:33.481 --> 45:36.067
I'd have to start as an underling
collecting money.

45:36.192 --> 45:39.571
Then, if I'm good enough,
I'll work my way up

45:39.696 --> 45:41.990
and take over a whole area.

45:42.115 --> 45:45.368
That's when you get to meet
the big fish.

45:46.536 --> 45:48.455
I need information.

45:48.580 --> 45:50.748
I can only get it from someone inside.

45:50.874 --> 45:54.252
Get out of here.
If they catch me, I'll end up dead.

45:54.377 --> 45:57.380
- You weren't born yesterday.
- But I don't want to die tomorrow.

46:00.133 --> 46:04.804
Look, in order to get information,
I have to use the same methods.

46:04.929 --> 46:06.639
I give you my protection.

46:06.764 --> 46:10.059
You organize the jobs
and I guarantee no one will interfere.

46:10.185 --> 46:13.188
You keep the loot, I get the information.

46:14.230 --> 46:17.609
- What about the kid?
- If he works with you, he'll be protected.

46:17.734 --> 46:19.319
- Really?
- But remember…

46:19.903 --> 46:22.780
Don't shoot anybody,
otherwise I'll lock you both up.

46:24.365 --> 46:26.034
Are you in?

46:30.288 --> 46:32.123
Deal. We can do that.

46:32.749 --> 46:36.544
I'll fill you in as soon
as they give me my first job.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.214
I was counting on that, Uncle Pepe.

46:39.339 --> 46:42.258
Here's your wallet.
Take care, Sergeant.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.807
Nobody move! This is a hold-up!

46:49.933 --> 46:51.684
Take it easy!

46:51.809 --> 46:53.478
- Sit down!
- Calm down!

46:53.603 --> 46:57.023
Excuse us, ladies,
but this is a hold-up.

47:00.652 --> 47:02.237
That's beautiful!

47:02.362 --> 47:04.030
You have good taste!

47:04.155 --> 47:06.199
Magnificent. Is that yours?

47:19.420 --> 47:21.047
What did I tell you?

47:21.172 --> 47:25.260
Welcome to our hotel,
ladies and gentlemen.

47:25.385 --> 47:29.097
May I have your documents, please?
It's the American Express group, right?

47:29.222 --> 47:30.807
Alright, quick.

47:31.558 --> 47:33.768
Write everything down.
Don't get distracted.

47:33.893 --> 47:38.940
If you have watches, pearls, diamonds,
you'd better leave them with us.

47:39.065 --> 47:41.150
There have been robberies
in our rooms.

47:41.276 --> 47:44.153
We wouldn't want unfortunate incidents
to happen again.

47:44.279 --> 47:46.114
- What's your name, sir?
- Cooper.

47:46.239 --> 47:48.408
- Cooper? A camera.
- Eighty dollars.

47:48.533 --> 47:50.326
Eighty dollars? What's your name?

47:50.451 --> 47:52.662
- Chéo.
- Chéo. 80 dollars.

47:52.787 --> 47:56.207
Last year at the fair,
with all the wallets Uncle Pepe stole,

47:56.332 --> 47:57.875
he bought a villa by the sea.

47:58.001 --> 48:00.962
<i>Doppia Vela to Vela Quattro.
Robbery at the Fleming Hotel.</i>

48:01.087 --> 48:05.133
- Nico, it's the hotel in front of us!
<i>- Vela Quattro to Doppia Vela.</i>

48:05.258 --> 48:07.010
- Now what?
- Start the siren and wait.

48:07.135 --> 48:09.554
Thank you, that's enough…

48:10.597 --> 48:15.268
A siren indicates a robbery.
We need to close, my friends.

48:15.393 --> 48:18.896
Thank you, my friends.
Go to your rooms. Thanks.

48:19.022 --> 48:21.190
This is Palmieri.
I'm close by the hotel.

48:21.316 --> 48:23.067
I'm heading over.

48:24.319 --> 48:26.195
Look how much stuff he got.

48:31.451 --> 48:32.910
Let them leave first.

48:33.620 --> 48:35.121
- What if…?
- Wait.

48:36.205 --> 48:38.708
- Now go.
- Closing the stable door…

48:42.086 --> 48:43.087
Now what?

48:43.212 --> 48:45.673
Talk to the manager
and try to buy us some time.

48:53.931 --> 48:57.435
This is Sergeant Palmieri.
We were too late. They're gone.

48:58.227 --> 48:59.604
Over and out.

49:07.487 --> 49:11.616
- Anything yet?
- It's a big organization, Sergeant.

49:11.741 --> 49:15.995
Very big. They've got the means,
the protection and the men.

49:16.579 --> 49:20.375
The people who run the operation
are from Marseilles.

49:21.084 --> 49:24.837
The Sicilians take care
of the kidnappings and the smuggling.

49:24.962 --> 49:28.466
The Calabrians take care
of manpower.

49:29.842 --> 49:31.552
Do you know who the boss is?

49:31.678 --> 49:34.555
The snake's head is too high for me.

49:35.348 --> 49:38.726
But I've heard that
they're organizing a big heist.

49:38.851 --> 49:43.147
Hundreds of millions
from the station's deposit box,

49:43.648 --> 49:48.194
to show banks and industries
that they can do as they please.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.530
At all levels.

49:51.906 --> 49:55.993
- Do you know who's in on it?
- Some big fish, I guess.

49:56.119 --> 50:00.289
Be careful.
There'll be many of them. Bye.

50:05.128 --> 50:07.338
Remember the guy from last time?

50:07.463 --> 50:11.843
I went in and I said, "Morning, I'm Ringo.
Give us the money."

50:11.968 --> 50:15.138
If he had tried to talk,
I'd have shot him.

50:15.263 --> 50:18.474
Cut the crap, you jerk! Shut up!

50:18.599 --> 50:20.101
Pull over.

50:26.858 --> 50:28.568
Don't play the hero. Get inside!

50:30.194 --> 50:33.322
- This is a hold-up! Don't move!
- Up against the wall!

50:33.448 --> 50:35.742
Don't mess with me or I'll shoot!

50:35.867 --> 50:38.953
All units, surround the building,
but don't interfere.

50:39.704 --> 50:42.290
Move into position
and wait for my signal.

50:42.749 --> 50:44.459
- Unit one?
<i>- In position.</i>

50:44.584 --> 50:48.755
- Unit two?
<i>- Unit two, in position.</i>

50:48.880 --> 50:50.214
Unit three.

50:50.339 --> 50:51.883
<i>Unit three, in position.</i>

50:52.008 --> 50:53.926
Unit four?

50:54.051 --> 50:55.470
Unit four?

50:56.220 --> 50:58.055
<i>Unit four, in position.</i>

51:04.729 --> 51:07.190
<i>Hello, Nicola? Hello, Nicola?</i>

51:08.441 --> 51:12.528
<i>I'm behind the wagons,
covering the south side. Over.</i>

51:12.653 --> 51:15.698
<i>Salvatore, the hold-up's ongoing.
They're inside now.</i>

51:15.823 --> 51:18.409
<i>Let's wait till they come out.
Over and out.</i>

51:24.499 --> 51:26.876
Great, guys. They're trapped.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.962
The police are in position.
It's our turn.

52:11.212 --> 52:13.130
Move it, asshole! Come on!

52:13.256 --> 52:15.591
Back off, or we'll kill them all.

52:15.716 --> 52:18.177
They've got hostages.
Don't shoot. Don't interfere.

52:19.929 --> 52:21.347
Move it!

52:22.014 --> 52:23.641
Move it, asshole!

52:23.766 --> 52:25.226
Get in!

52:25.977 --> 52:27.562
Don't move, or I'll kill you!

52:29.564 --> 52:30.982
Let's go!

52:33.025 --> 52:34.777
They let the hostages go. Move in.

53:25.536 --> 53:28.748
Fucking piece of junk!
Fucking piece of junk!

53:33.628 --> 53:34.962
Nicola!

53:37.006 --> 53:38.382
Nicola!

54:15.378 --> 54:19.298
- What's going on?
- A hold-up. They're killing lots of people!

54:20.883 --> 54:22.677
- Here.
- What are you doing?

54:23.427 --> 54:25.763
- Wait here.
- Where are you going? Are you crazy?

55:37.334 --> 55:39.045
- Let's go!
- Come on!

55:46.552 --> 55:48.804
Gianni! Gianni!

55:50.806 --> 55:52.641
How are you, my love?

55:52.767 --> 55:54.935
- What happened?
- Nothing. Easy.

55:55.061 --> 55:56.520
I'm Sergeant Palmieri.

55:58.814 --> 56:00.900
I'm Engineer Rossetti.

56:01.025 --> 56:04.820
I just got back from a skeet shoot.
I heard the shots, so I stepped in.

56:04.945 --> 56:06.781
Thank you for your help.

56:08.741 --> 56:11.118
Make yourself available
for the investigation.

56:13.746 --> 56:15.706
What investigation?

56:15.831 --> 56:18.417
They'll want revenge.
What's going to happen to us?

56:18.542 --> 56:20.795
- What's going to happen to you?
- Nothing.

56:25.299 --> 56:28.969
Let's see what the newspaper says.
Listen to this.

56:31.806 --> 56:34.892
"Skeet shooting champion
versus the Mob.

56:36.185 --> 56:38.938
"Dead and wounded people
at the station.

56:39.605 --> 56:42.483
"The intervention
of skeet shooter Gianni Rossetti

56:42.608 --> 56:48.322
"was decisive in the crossfire
with the police led by Sergeant Palmieri."

56:48.447 --> 56:50.908
Listen to this. They mention me.

56:51.033 --> 56:56.539
"The champion's wife declared,
'It was terrifying. I got really scared.

56:56.664 --> 57:01.502
'I'm used to firearms and gunshots,
but this was a really terrible scene.

57:01.627 --> 57:04.713
'The shouting, the dead, the wounded.
There was blood everywhere.

57:04.839 --> 57:06.590
'People freaked out.

57:06.715 --> 57:09.468
'They ran away,
they trampled each other.

57:09.593 --> 57:13.305
'They shouted while
the machine guns kept shooting.

57:13.430 --> 57:16.767
'Tens of cops on the ground,
some of them dead,

57:16.892 --> 57:19.520
'the wounded dragging
themselves to safety.

57:19.645 --> 57:20.729
'I was terrified…'

57:21.605 --> 57:22.606
Stop!

57:23.232 --> 57:24.233
Help!

57:27.027 --> 57:28.279
Stop!

57:28.946 --> 57:30.739
Come on!

57:31.949 --> 57:33.367
Help!

57:34.827 --> 57:36.245
Stay still!

57:40.166 --> 57:41.500
Stop!

57:41.625 --> 57:43.502
- Gianni!
- Let her go!

57:45.504 --> 57:46.839
Anna!

57:52.761 --> 57:54.013
Rip her pants off!

57:54.972 --> 57:56.640
Who goes first?

58:05.316 --> 58:09.069
Look what they're doing to your wife.
You can't do that to her anymore!

58:09.195 --> 58:10.988
What did you expect?
Another medal?

58:15.868 --> 58:17.453
You dirty whore!

58:19.538 --> 58:22.333
That's what you get
for helping the cops.

58:22.458 --> 58:26.754
- Watch!
- Enough. She passed out.

58:26.879 --> 58:29.423
Say what you want,
but I don't like it this way.

58:30.716 --> 58:32.426
Let him go.

58:32.551 --> 58:35.763
You asshole.
Did you like the article?

58:37.139 --> 58:39.183
I really needed to pee.

58:39.767 --> 58:43.145
That's what you get
for playing the hero, you asshole!

58:43.270 --> 58:45.606
Let's go. Move it. Hurry up.

58:46.982 --> 58:50.319
Sorry, ma'am.
We're just lighting a little fire.

58:50.444 --> 58:53.572
Just to warm the place up a little,
it's freezing in here.

58:56.408 --> 58:59.203
Come on. Out.
Get out.

59:00.412 --> 59:02.248
Let's have a barbecue.

59:04.124 --> 59:05.501
What the fuck?

59:11.590 --> 59:12.925
Let's go.

59:18.847 --> 59:20.015
Gianni!

59:21.058 --> 59:22.268
Anna!

59:33.028 --> 59:34.655
Gianni, help me!

59:34.780 --> 59:36.282
Anna!

59:58.554 --> 1:00:00.180
<i>- This is the Marseillais.</i>
- Rudy?

1:00:00.306 --> 1:00:01.849
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Tell me.

1:00:01.974 --> 1:00:05.686
<i>Everything's ready. Today, closing time.
At the bank, Credito Laziale.</i>

1:00:05.811 --> 1:00:08.314
Credito Laziale? At closing time.

1:00:08.439 --> 1:00:09.940
<i>- Scared?</i>
- No, no.

1:00:10.065 --> 1:00:12.026
- I'm not scared.
<i>- You going to chicken out?</i>

1:00:12.151 --> 1:00:15.154
I've never chickened out.
I'll be there.

1:00:15.821 --> 1:00:18.282
<i>- What about the kid?</i>
- The kid?

1:00:19.158 --> 1:00:21.869
<i>- Is he going to work with you?</i>
- Yes, of course.

1:00:22.578 --> 1:00:25.622
The kid will be there.
We'll both be there. Don't worry.

1:00:25.748 --> 1:00:27.583
<i>- It's important.</i>
- Alright.

1:00:31.253 --> 1:00:35.257
- Margherita, give me a token.
- Right away. There you go.

1:00:44.975 --> 1:00:46.185
<i>Hello?</i>

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:47.853
- Is that the police station?
- Yes.

1:00:47.978 --> 1:00:50.439
- I need to talk to Sergeant Palmieri.
<i>- One second.</i>

1:00:50.564 --> 1:00:51.648
Thanks.

1:00:51.774 --> 1:00:53.108
<i>Sergeant Palmieri's office.</i>

1:00:53.233 --> 1:00:55.778
- Please put the sergeant on.
<i>- Who's speaking?</i>

1:00:55.903 --> 1:00:57.988
I can't tell you,
but he's expecting my call.

1:00:58.113 --> 1:01:01.241
- It's very urgent. It's important.
<i>- The sergeant's on a mission.</i>

1:01:01.367 --> 1:01:05.079
<i>- Can't you get hold of him some way?
- I'm sorry, that's impossible.</i>

1:01:05.204 --> 1:01:08.540
<i>It's a matter of life and death.
I'm his uncle.</i>

1:01:08.665 --> 1:01:11.043
<i>Remember.
It's a matter of life and death.</i>

1:01:11.168 --> 1:01:12.169
Thank you.

1:01:14.213 --> 1:01:16.298
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

1:01:39.696 --> 1:01:41.156
I'll take the keys.

1:01:41.281 --> 1:01:43.409
- What are you doing?
- You're back at it again?

1:02:01.009 --> 1:02:05.055
Take them both to the station.
I'll call ahead.

1:02:06.056 --> 1:02:09.268
This is Sergeant Palmieri.
I arrested two of the guys.

1:02:09.393 --> 1:02:12.604
<i>Great. By the way,
your uncle called several times.</i>

1:02:12.729 --> 1:02:14.690
- My uncle?
<i>- Yes, he was worried.</i>

1:02:14.815 --> 1:02:16.900
<i>He said it was a matter
of life and death.</i>

1:02:17.025 --> 1:02:20.779
<i>Ah, thank you.
My uncle's always joking.</i>

1:02:29.246 --> 1:02:33.167
Hello? Police?
There's a hold-up at the bank.

1:02:33.292 --> 1:02:36.962
That's right. No, it doesn't matter
who I am. Hurry.

1:02:52.352 --> 1:02:53.854
<i>Attention all units.</i>

1:02:53.979 --> 1:02:56.648
<i>There's a hold-up at the bank,
Credito Laziale.</i>

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:59.568
This is Sergeant Palmieri.
I'm on my way with three men.

1:03:04.198 --> 1:03:06.074
Don't move! This is a hold-up!

1:03:09.453 --> 1:03:11.705
Take it easy. Shut up!
Don't do anything stupid.

1:03:11.830 --> 1:03:15.042
Up against the wall. Keep calm.

1:03:15.167 --> 1:03:18.170
Move it. You too.
Up against the wall!

1:03:18.712 --> 1:03:20.589
Don't freak out. Calm down.

1:03:20.714 --> 1:03:23.050
- I said, up against the wall!
- Okay, take it easy.

1:03:23.175 --> 1:03:24.635
- Who's the manager?
- I am.

1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:27.095
Do me a favor.
Put the money in here.

1:03:27.221 --> 1:03:30.349
Take it easy, you guys.
Especially the kid.

1:03:30.474 --> 1:03:32.309
- Just give me the money.
- Of course.

1:03:32.434 --> 1:03:34.061
All of it. Yes.

1:03:43.237 --> 1:03:45.906
The cops are here!
We're screwed, Uncle!

1:03:46.031 --> 1:03:47.157
Calm down.

1:03:56.250 --> 1:04:00.212
- They're inside, Sergeant.
- Lower your weapons. You too.

1:04:00.837 --> 1:04:04.174
- That's Nicola.
- Your friend screwed us.

1:04:04.299 --> 1:04:06.843
- I'm going to kill him!
It's the police!

1:04:08.428 --> 1:04:09.721
Stop it!

1:04:10.597 --> 1:04:13.725
If you do that again,
I'll beat the hell out of you.

1:04:14.434 --> 1:04:16.562
Uncle Pepe, I'm here.

1:04:16.687 --> 1:04:20.983
- Let me in. I didn't send the police.
- You're lying. Stay where you are!

1:04:21.108 --> 1:04:24.528
Don't be a jerk. You're trapped.
There's nothing you can do.

1:04:24.653 --> 1:04:28.115
Get me a car with a full tank of fuel.
And 200 million cash.

1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:31.076
I'll come out with the hostages.
Shoot, and it'll be a bloodbath.

1:04:31.201 --> 1:04:32.869
- Take it easy.
- You've nothing to fear.

1:04:32.995 --> 1:04:34.663
I'm coming in unarmed.

1:04:34.788 --> 1:04:36.498
Here. Whatever happens,
don't shoot.

1:04:37.791 --> 1:04:40.794
I'm not carrying a gun.
Let the hostages out, I'm coming in.

1:04:40.919 --> 1:04:44.965
- Don't move, or I'll shoot.
- Hey, what are you saying?

1:04:45.090 --> 1:04:46.508
It's Nico.

1:04:52.681 --> 1:04:54.099
Come in, Nico.

1:04:55.017 --> 1:04:58.228
Put that gun down, Picchio.
Come on.

1:04:59.479 --> 1:05:03.817
He went in on his own.
He's unarmed. He's crazy.

1:05:03.942 --> 1:05:07.779
- Those guys are criminals!
- They killed a child!

1:05:07.904 --> 1:05:10.490
They killed one of the employees!

1:05:10.616 --> 1:05:14.953
It wasn't me. Do you understand?
Someone called headquarters.

1:05:15.078 --> 1:05:17.122
- I'll kill you!
- Picchio!

1:05:17.247 --> 1:05:20.000
I know, it's partly my fault,
but I've always helped you.

1:05:20.125 --> 1:05:21.835
I've never missed an appointment.

1:05:21.960 --> 1:05:24.755
- Then what?
- Nothing's going to happen. You'll see.

1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:26.423
I'll fix this.

1:05:27.299 --> 1:05:30.844
Do you really want to shoot me?
Do you?

1:05:32.012 --> 1:05:33.555
You want to kill me?

1:05:33.680 --> 1:05:35.641
- No.
- Good.

1:05:38.727 --> 1:05:42.814
- Murderers! They're all murderers!
- They killed a hostage!

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:45.734
They killed a little boy!

1:05:45.859 --> 1:05:48.570
We should reinstate the death penalty,
like in the USA!

1:05:48.695 --> 1:05:50.489
Count the money, sir.

1:05:50.614 --> 1:05:52.991
- Check if anything's missing.
- Alright.

1:05:53.116 --> 1:05:54.910
It's all here.

1:05:55.035 --> 1:05:56.870
Listen, Uncle Pepe…

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:16.014
Information about Rudy the Marseillais
and a couple more of those bastards.

1:06:16.139 --> 1:06:19.893
- Who's behind them?
- I don't know, but it must be big fish.

1:06:20.018 --> 1:06:22.270
They have a meeting in a few days.

1:06:22.396 --> 1:06:25.190
They'll talk about how
they're going to carve up the city.

1:06:25.315 --> 1:06:27.567
Do you know where this meeting
will take place?

1:06:27.693 --> 1:06:31.071
That I don't know,
and I guess I never will.

1:06:33.031 --> 1:06:37.202
- We'd better leave.
- Nico, you have to help the kid.

1:06:37.327 --> 1:06:39.496
Or he'll be in a lot of trouble.

1:06:39.621 --> 1:06:41.206
I'll do what I can.

1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:43.458
Thanks.

1:06:44.418 --> 1:06:45.919
Thank you, Uncle Pepe.

1:06:50.674 --> 1:06:53.927
Hello?
No, the bank's closed.

1:06:55.095 --> 1:06:56.680
There's a hold-up.

1:06:56.805 --> 1:07:00.726
Who I am?
I'm the jerk who organized it.

1:07:02.185 --> 1:07:06.314
Call headquarters. Get the car here.
And tell these people to back off.

1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:08.400
- Come on.
- It's dangerous.

1:07:08.525 --> 1:07:12.070
- Don't worry.
- They're going to kill us.

1:07:12.195 --> 1:07:13.655
Picchio, come on!

1:07:23.498 --> 1:07:26.877
Here they come!
Let's give them what they deserve!

1:07:39.222 --> 1:07:41.933
Save the kid, Nicola!

1:07:42.058 --> 1:07:43.477
Help!

1:07:44.352 --> 1:07:45.604
Uncle Pepe!

1:07:54.780 --> 1:07:58.992
Let him go!
Picchio! Picchio!

1:08:14.508 --> 1:08:18.261
<i>You were taken off this case,
but you went rogue as usual.</i>

1:08:18.386 --> 1:08:21.807
<i>And yet again, someone got killed.
A kid.</i>

1:08:21.932 --> 1:08:28.230
With your reckless methods,
you got your superior into a jam.

1:08:28.355 --> 1:08:30.982
There's obviously going to be
an investigation.

1:08:31.107 --> 1:08:33.777
- He didn't even know about it.
- Never mind, Nicola.

1:08:33.902 --> 1:08:36.279
You had nothing to do with it.
It was my idea.

1:08:36.404 --> 1:08:38.782
- And you know that.
- Good, good.

1:08:38.907 --> 1:08:42.619
You organized gangs
with the worst delinquents.

1:08:42.744 --> 1:08:44.162
Well done.

1:08:44.287 --> 1:08:46.248
You knew I was investigating this case.

1:08:46.373 --> 1:08:49.918
If we don't stop them, they'll make us
pay for the air that we breathe.

1:08:50.043 --> 1:08:53.630
With my reckless methods, as you say,
in dealing with the organized gangs,

1:08:53.755 --> 1:08:57.384
- I was about to catch them.
- But you were not allowed to do so.

1:08:57.509 --> 1:09:01.054
You're going to have to answer for this.
For the moment, you're fired.

1:09:03.181 --> 1:09:06.810
Wait a minute…
What did you just say?

1:09:06.935 --> 1:09:09.229
You're fired. You're out.

1:09:14.734 --> 1:09:17.821
- At least tell me who tipped you off.
- What?

1:09:17.946 --> 1:09:21.283
Oh, yes, it was an anonymous tip.

1:09:21.408 --> 1:09:22.784
Anonymous…

1:09:24.452 --> 1:09:27.664
From high up.
Very high up, right, sir?

1:10:01.114 --> 1:10:02.532
Hello, sir.

1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:07.120
Two hundred targets a day?

1:10:08.330 --> 1:10:09.915
For two months?

1:10:11.333 --> 1:10:14.169
What if I asked you
to shoot a different target?

1:10:29.476 --> 1:10:31.937
It's time you kept your promise.

1:10:32.062 --> 1:10:36.441
Remember when you said,
"If I live, we'll gut them together"?

1:10:37.817 --> 1:10:39.736
Well, you're living.

1:10:39.861 --> 1:10:42.989
Living? Hardly.

1:10:44.324 --> 1:10:46.076
Anyway, Sergeant…

1:10:46.201 --> 1:10:49.663
there are things you don't do
with the sirens blaring.

1:10:51.164 --> 1:10:52.582
Mazzarelli…

1:10:55.460 --> 1:10:57.295
I'm not a cop anymore.

1:10:59.255 --> 1:11:03.259
You just have to tell me
where and when they're going to meet.

1:11:03.385 --> 1:11:05.095
Leave the rest to me.

1:11:05.220 --> 1:11:06.888
Go in.

1:11:07.013 --> 1:11:10.266
<i>Look who's here. Sergeant Palmieri.</i>

1:11:10.392 --> 1:11:13.228
Hi, Domenico.
Would you work for me?

1:11:13.353 --> 1:11:15.730
With my machine gun?

1:11:15.855 --> 1:11:18.984
- Who's the enemy?
- The guys who took over your position.

1:11:19.109 --> 1:11:21.987
- Have your cop friends do it.
- No, I need someone more resolute.

1:11:22.112 --> 1:11:24.197
Someone who can shoot like you.

1:11:25.782 --> 1:11:29.077
- What's in it for me?
- I'll get you out of here.

1:11:29.202 --> 1:11:30.620
And then?

1:11:30.745 --> 1:11:34.749
Then I'll get you a fake passport
and you'll disappear.

1:11:36.584 --> 1:11:38.461
How do I know you won't screw me?

1:11:38.586 --> 1:11:41.881
I can screw you
as much as you can screw me, so…

1:11:42.007 --> 1:11:43.758
It works both ways.

1:11:47.178 --> 1:11:48.680
Are you in?

1:11:49.806 --> 1:11:51.266
I'm in.

1:11:52.517 --> 1:11:58.023
I already killed three people…
in silence.

1:11:59.566 --> 1:12:01.276
This doesn't make a sound.

1:12:04.863 --> 1:12:06.865
While they were asleep.

1:12:08.450 --> 1:12:10.618
They were murderers.

1:12:13.705 --> 1:12:15.165
Sergeant…

1:12:16.708 --> 1:12:21.838
If you get me a machine gun,
I'll shoot them in the dining hall.

1:12:23.006 --> 1:12:24.591
I'll kill them all.

1:12:26.301 --> 1:12:28.720
Three hundred murderers less
in the world.

1:12:28.845 --> 1:12:31.222
I'm not asking you to kill them…

1:12:33.516 --> 1:12:35.852
… but the man who raped
your daughter.

1:12:37.395 --> 1:12:40.607
<i>Uncle Pepe, everything's ready
for the day after tomorrow.</i>

1:12:40.732 --> 1:12:45.153
There's no point in getting out.
What do you want with a guy like me?

1:12:45.278 --> 1:12:49.240
- I've never held a gun in my life.
- Uncle Pepe, I need you.

1:12:49.365 --> 1:12:52.452
I need you because you're a wise man
with a nice smile.

1:12:52.577 --> 1:12:56.498
Before I can start smiling again,
they have to die.

1:12:57.457 --> 1:12:58.875
All of them.

1:13:01.211 --> 1:13:02.754
Is it sweet?

1:13:04.798 --> 1:13:09.052
Nico, come on, hurry up!
If someone sees you here, I'm screwed.

1:14:41.144 --> 1:14:45.523
What the fuck are you doing?
Try that again and I'll kill you.

1:14:45.648 --> 1:14:47.817
Get in.

1:14:51.529 --> 1:14:53.489
Stinker.

1:14:55.783 --> 1:15:01.039
- Here you'll have food and beds.
- Ah, nice. Magnificent!

1:15:01.664 --> 1:15:03.666
It looks like the Grand Hotel.

1:15:04.667 --> 1:15:06.669
What do you want, security or comfort?

1:15:06.794 --> 1:15:09.214
I'd prefer to have both.

1:15:09.339 --> 1:15:12.342
I warn you, if I see one bedbug,
I'm out of here.

1:15:13.259 --> 1:15:17.513
How nice. We have everything,
a dining room, a lounge.

1:15:17.639 --> 1:15:19.265
And dead rats.

1:15:19.390 --> 1:15:22.393
A kitchen, and another tenants.

1:15:22.518 --> 1:15:24.771
May I? Pleased to meet you.

1:15:25.939 --> 1:15:29.859
- Nice to meet you. Mazzarelli.
- The gambling guy. Las Vegas.

1:15:29.984 --> 1:15:32.362
Not Las Vegas, <i>Las Garbatellas.</i>

1:15:34.489 --> 1:15:36.157
Uncle Pepe. May I?

1:15:37.742 --> 1:15:39.369
Guess not.

1:15:39.494 --> 1:15:43.039
You…
you're the machine gun soloist, right?

1:15:43.915 --> 1:15:46.459
From the shooting
on the streets of Milan?

1:15:46.584 --> 1:15:48.670
It was a massacre.

1:15:48.795 --> 1:15:50.630
I'll kill you!

1:15:52.257 --> 1:15:53.716
Enough!

1:15:55.009 --> 1:15:57.971
One can't even have coffee in peace.

1:16:06.896 --> 1:16:09.107
I'll kill you, you bastard!

1:16:09.232 --> 1:16:11.442
Stop! Stop!

1:16:11.567 --> 1:16:13.027
Knock it off!

1:16:15.113 --> 1:16:16.823
I'll kill him!

1:16:17.782 --> 1:16:21.577
Listen, I'm the boss here.
Do you understand?

1:16:21.703 --> 1:16:24.914
Don't you want me to kill him?
He's a murderer.

1:16:25.039 --> 1:16:27.834
We are all equal here, alright?

1:16:30.503 --> 1:16:33.464
- That goes for you too.
- I'll beat the fuck out of him…

1:16:33.589 --> 1:16:38.553
No, you're not beating anyone.
Are we clear?

1:16:43.725 --> 1:16:47.312
We're going to have to stay here
for a few days, so let's stay calm.

1:16:49.355 --> 1:16:52.025
You too. Are we clear?

1:16:52.150 --> 1:16:55.278
- Of course.
- Very clear.

1:16:55.403 --> 1:16:59.657
You want to fight a war against
the racketeers with these four clowns?

1:16:59.782 --> 1:17:03.536
Sergeant, I think
you're out of your mind.

1:17:03.661 --> 1:17:07.707
I already told you. I just need you
to tell me where they're going to meet.

1:17:07.832 --> 1:17:10.043
- I'll handle the rest.
- Yes.

1:17:10.168 --> 1:17:13.296
What are you going to do?
Make us play the heroes?

1:17:13.421 --> 1:17:17.550
They'll kill us before we even get there.
There'll be many of them.

1:17:17.675 --> 1:17:21.220
All the big fish will be there,
like the Calabrian.

1:17:21.346 --> 1:17:23.973
They'll arrive with an armed escort.

1:17:24.098 --> 1:17:27.977
- Where?
- At Barrera's factory on Via Cassia.

1:17:28.102 --> 1:17:29.354
What do they produce?

1:17:29.479 --> 1:17:32.357
Officially, agricultural tools
and machinery,

1:17:32.482 --> 1:17:34.525
but it's a cover for their drug trade.

1:17:34.650 --> 1:17:36.819
Why would they choose
such a place?

1:17:36.944 --> 1:17:40.698
What location is safer
than a big factory out of town?

1:17:42.492 --> 1:17:44.577
Do you know when
they'll hold the meeting?

1:17:44.702 --> 1:17:47.830
In four days, they'll all be there.

1:17:47.955 --> 1:17:49.415
At night?

1:17:49.540 --> 1:17:52.502
Why would they meet at night?
It's a Saturday.

1:17:52.627 --> 1:17:54.837
There won't be any workers around.

1:17:55.838 --> 1:17:58.925
Then we go in Friday evening
and wait for them.

1:18:31.666 --> 1:18:36.712
Regaleali, Vallelunga.
What a fine wine!

1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:43.803
What are you going to do
with all these fireworks?

1:18:43.928 --> 1:18:46.389
Is this the Festival of Piedigrotta?

1:19:19.130 --> 1:19:22.008
- What about bullets?
- I'll give them to you in due time.

1:19:22.133 --> 1:19:24.177
Then pay me
and get me that passport first.

1:19:24.302 --> 1:19:26.512
You'll get that when I'm ready.

1:19:26.637 --> 1:19:29.015
That's assuming you're still alive.

1:19:29.140 --> 1:19:32.059
- The deal's off.
- Then try to leave.

1:19:32.185 --> 1:19:34.520
If you're all here risking your lives…

1:19:36.022 --> 1:19:39.567
… it's because every one of you
has a very specific personal reason.

1:19:39.692 --> 1:19:44.280
They raped your daughter.
And she took her own life.

1:19:46.073 --> 1:19:48.326
They broke your back.

1:19:48.451 --> 1:19:51.287
They destroyed you.
You're nothing but a wreck.

1:19:52.246 --> 1:19:54.373
They raped and killed your wife.

1:19:54.499 --> 1:19:58.669
We all have the same people to blame.
I'm also driven by a personal motive.

1:19:58.794 --> 1:20:02.298
This is the only chance I have
to do what I think is right.

1:20:02.423 --> 1:20:04.300
I think you're crazy, Sergeant.

1:20:04.425 --> 1:20:06.260
We're a little crazy.

1:20:06.385 --> 1:20:09.096
But we have one goal in common:
revenge.

1:20:10.139 --> 1:20:14.852
If you decide to stay, you'll have
to run the risk till the very end.

1:20:17.146 --> 1:20:18.981
It's up to you.

1:20:24.195 --> 1:20:25.404
Yes!

1:20:28.658 --> 1:20:32.453
If you need someone to cheer you up
while you get killed…

1:20:33.496 --> 1:20:34.956
… count me in.

1:20:43.631 --> 1:20:47.093
If we stick together,
we can make it, I'm sure.

1:20:49.136 --> 1:20:52.014
Come here, you bastard!
Son of a bitch!

1:20:52.139 --> 1:20:55.017
Give me my clothes back.
Cut it out!

1:20:55.142 --> 1:20:57.728
Stop, you bastard!

1:20:59.230 --> 1:21:02.692
Give them back.
What are you doing? Drop dead!

1:21:02.817 --> 1:21:04.735
- Get out of here!
- Help! Help!

1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:07.321
- Hello?
- Who's there?

1:21:07.446 --> 1:21:10.408
Some idiot threw my clothes
over the gate.

1:21:10.533 --> 1:21:14.203
- Good Lord, you're naked!
- Quick, I'm cold!

1:21:14.328 --> 1:21:16.914
- Just a second.
- Give me back my clothes.

1:21:17.039 --> 1:21:19.208
What are you going to give me
in return?

1:21:19.333 --> 1:21:23.087
- This is all I have.
- Then give me that, good girl.

1:21:23.212 --> 1:21:27.508
I'll open the gate. Come in.
I'll make you some hot milk and butter.

1:21:27.633 --> 1:21:30.428
- Give that to your sister!
- I didn't mean it like that.

1:21:30.553 --> 1:21:33.347
The butter's for you…

1:21:35.391 --> 1:21:39.103
- Wait for me.
- Come on, hurry up! Let's go.

1:21:39.228 --> 1:21:42.523
Coming. Here I am.
Don't rush me.

1:21:42.648 --> 1:21:45.109
If I get nervous, I won't be any use.

1:21:45.234 --> 1:21:48.362
That's just an excuse.
Come on, man!

1:21:59.498 --> 1:22:02.960
- Tell me you like it.
- Yes, I like it, but hurry up.

1:22:07.131 --> 1:22:09.050
- Are you done?
- Don't distract me.

1:22:14.138 --> 1:22:17.725
Here.
Professional.

1:24:07.793 --> 1:24:10.087
Will it bear our weight
if we get inside?

1:24:11.922 --> 1:24:13.841
I think so.

1:24:13.966 --> 1:24:18.137
But when they turn it on,
it's going to be difficult.

1:24:18.262 --> 1:24:21.307
Then get up there
and go as far as the first grating.

1:24:22.016 --> 1:24:24.101
- Alright?
- Alright.

1:24:29.148 --> 1:24:32.943
Follow him. Get to one of the gratings
further down.

1:24:33.068 --> 1:24:35.446
- After the second pillar?
- Yes.

1:24:42.036 --> 1:24:44.205
- Mazzarelli?
- Eh?

1:24:44.330 --> 1:24:46.373
Where's the john?

1:24:47.625 --> 1:24:48.876
Anywhere you want.

1:24:50.294 --> 1:24:54.256
Take this. It's a good rifle.

1:24:55.257 --> 1:24:57.343
I'll use the other one.

1:25:02.515 --> 1:25:06.519
You're forgetting one minor detail.
The passport.

1:25:17.112 --> 1:25:19.114
Have a nice trip.

1:26:12.918 --> 1:26:17.548
- Here, Uncle Pepe.
- No, no. Nico, it'd be wasted on me.

1:26:17.673 --> 1:26:19.967
When I see a weapon,
I shit my pants.

1:26:20.092 --> 1:26:22.219
You can use it better than I can.

1:26:22.344 --> 1:26:26.265
- Are you giving up on us?
- Of course not. I'm not a stinker.

1:26:26.390 --> 1:26:28.642
If you're gonna have fun,
I'm gonna have fun.

1:26:28.767 --> 1:26:30.227
With what?

1:26:30.352 --> 1:26:33.856
With these fireworks.
I'll light them over their heads.

1:26:35.482 --> 1:26:39.820
Uncle, would you go up there
and watch the entrance and exit?

1:26:40.821 --> 1:26:42.531
- Up there?
- Yes.

1:26:44.700 --> 1:26:49.121
Alright. The higher you go,
the more you get hurt.

1:26:49.246 --> 1:26:51.790
I always end up flat on my ass.

1:26:53.459 --> 1:26:57.171
But, Nico… I'm scared.

1:26:57.755 --> 1:26:59.465
Me too, Uncle Pepe.

1:27:00.549 --> 1:27:01.800
Me too.

1:27:02.968 --> 1:27:04.386
Let's go.

1:27:09.767 --> 1:27:11.352
Sergeant?

1:27:11.477 --> 1:27:14.688
I'll cover the entrance,
I'm younger than him.

1:27:14.813 --> 1:27:17.399
- Alright, go.
- It's the best place.

1:27:19.318 --> 1:27:21.570
I'll kill them all from up there, eh?

1:27:21.695 --> 1:27:25.532
I'll let them in,
and once they're inside, I'll shoot them.

1:27:25.658 --> 1:27:29.244
- All of them.
- But wait for my signal before shooting.

1:27:29.370 --> 1:27:30.829
Agreed?

1:27:32.331 --> 1:27:35.918
Before you pull the trigger,
wait for my signal. Understand?

1:27:37.878 --> 1:27:39.713
Yes, of course.

1:28:03.612 --> 1:28:05.406
Mother of God!

1:28:05.948 --> 1:28:06.991
Damn…

1:28:07.658 --> 1:28:10.869
Hey, Nico…
You're feeling scared, huh?

1:28:12.538 --> 1:28:14.540
Here, have a little sniff.

1:29:08.093 --> 1:29:10.012
Here they are. They're coming.

1:29:21.774 --> 1:29:26.737
Can you see him? It's Barrera.
He's the owner of this place.

1:29:26.862 --> 1:29:30.699
The other guy's Rasparo, into money
laundering and currency smuggling.

1:29:30.824 --> 1:29:32.785
The best of criminals.

1:29:33.744 --> 1:29:36.872
And that's… Cuomo, the Calabrian.

1:29:37.581 --> 1:29:39.833
He's into kidnapping.

1:29:39.958 --> 1:29:42.711
And that's… Wow!

1:29:42.836 --> 1:29:46.006
That's Lou Jemair,
from the Marseillais clan.

1:29:46.131 --> 1:29:49.176
Robbery, drug trafficking, smuggling.

1:29:51.804 --> 1:29:56.100
And the last guy…
Yes, that's Oreste Saclà.

1:29:56.225 --> 1:29:59.478
From the industrial triangle.
Gambling, nightclubs, drugs.

1:30:00.312 --> 1:30:02.314
They're all here.

1:30:04.817 --> 1:30:10.114
Nico… here's that son of a bitch,
Rudy the Marseillais.

1:30:10.739 --> 1:30:13.158
With those four rats behind him.

1:30:50.779 --> 1:30:53.782
Mazzarelli, who's that?

1:30:53.907 --> 1:30:56.326
I don't know. I can't see his face.

1:31:26.607 --> 1:31:28.358
Who can it be?

1:31:29.067 --> 1:31:31.862
We'll have to start
with a spectacular act.

1:31:35.532 --> 1:31:40.078
A hostage won't pay?
Send their body to the press.

1:31:41.038 --> 1:31:43.123
A shopkeeper refuses protection?

1:31:43.248 --> 1:31:46.084
Punish them,
so the whole neighborhood will know.

1:31:46.210 --> 1:31:47.419
The lawyer.

1:31:47.544 --> 1:31:49.922
The others will think twice
before refusing to pay.

1:31:50.047 --> 1:31:51.465
The lawyer.

1:31:51.590 --> 1:31:56.178
Factories, industries, associations
will all have to pay if they want to work.

1:31:56.303 --> 1:31:59.473
Even private citizens will have to pay.

1:31:59.598 --> 1:32:04.478
If they refuse, blow up their gas pipes.
Even their houses, if necessary.

1:32:04.603 --> 1:32:07.064
Let them know that
they can't defend themselves.

1:32:07.189 --> 1:32:09.107
Make them live in fear.

1:32:10.150 --> 1:32:13.528
One phone call will be enough
to make them pay.

1:32:13.654 --> 1:32:18.075
Do you have children you love?
Then pay.

1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:22.537
Did you invest all your savings
to buy your home? Sell it and pay.

1:32:22.663 --> 1:32:24.998
Do you have a salary?
Share it with us.

1:32:25.123 --> 1:32:28.168
Do you have a dog, a horse, a cat?
Pay, pay!

1:32:31.380 --> 1:32:33.715
It'll be like tax.

1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:35.801
And evasion is not acceptable.

1:32:35.926 --> 1:32:38.720
In the States, it was a major crisis
with people starving

1:32:38.845 --> 1:32:40.722
that gave rise to racketeering.

1:32:40.847 --> 1:32:44.601
We'll do the same,
but we're going to need support.

1:32:44.726 --> 1:32:47.813
Politicians, judges, cops.

1:32:47.938 --> 1:32:49.773
- What if they refuse?
- All of them!

1:32:49.898 --> 1:32:53.860
Politicians want chaos too.
People's insecurities benefit them.

1:32:53.986 --> 1:32:57.239
Besides, we'll pay them off.
We'll blackmail them, we'll threaten them.

1:32:57.364 --> 1:32:59.408
We'll kill them, if necessary!

1:33:06.748 --> 1:33:09.459
I knew he'd screw it up!

1:33:43.994 --> 1:33:45.037
Damn!

1:33:53.712 --> 1:33:55.380
They're wiping us out!

1:33:55.505 --> 1:33:57.090
- Run!
- Where?

1:33:57.215 --> 1:33:58.842
Run!

1:34:33.710 --> 1:34:36.004
Help me! Help me!

1:36:14.311 --> 1:36:16.646
Look who's here.

1:36:22.027 --> 1:36:24.696
Bitch, what do you think
you're doing?

1:36:24.821 --> 1:36:27.073
Can't you see I'm immortal?

1:37:41.022 --> 1:37:42.190
Sergeant.

1:37:43.066 --> 1:37:47.362
You can't… You just can't.
You can't do anything!

1:37:47.487 --> 1:37:51.032
You know me, I'm the lawyer!
Get out of here!

1:37:52.701 --> 1:37:54.619
Get out of here! Leave!

1:39:25.627 --> 1:39:27.712
Did you see that, Stefania?

1:39:29.089 --> 1:39:31.257
Daddy kept his promise.

1:39:31.383 --> 1:39:33.385
He took them all out.

1:39:34.969 --> 1:39:36.346
All of them.

1:39:37.347 --> 1:39:40.892
You know, the first pig I killed was…

1:39:44.854 --> 1:39:46.606
No, wait.

1:39:46.731 --> 1:39:50.735
Wait for me, I'm coming.
I'll tell you in person, Stefania.

1:40:21.641 --> 1:40:24.436
Nicola! Nicola! Watch out!

1:40:46.166 --> 1:40:48.334
For fuck's sake.

1:40:51.921 --> 1:40:53.381
Sergeant!

1:40:54.007 --> 1:40:55.425
Sergeant!

1:41:02.307 --> 1:41:06.144
There's only the two of us left.
Why don't we make a deal?

1:41:06.895 --> 1:41:08.438
Without the guns.

1:41:15.945 --> 1:41:19.032
They're all dead, Sergeant.

1:41:19.908 --> 1:41:23.244
You're a murderer, just like us.
You've also killed people.
