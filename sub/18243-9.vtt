00:05.106 --> 00:06.907
Previously on
"Just Add Magic"...

00:06.974 --> 00:09.477
The book literally never ends.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.412
You must protect the book.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.646
It is in danger.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.948
The recipes that we saw
in Chuck's book.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.550
They're missing from ours.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.353
He has his own cookbook
that's stealing our spells?

00:19.420 --> 00:22.656
He stole my seed
when he stole Ida's.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.658
Grandma lied to us.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.161
I'm not gonna let him
disappear with my morbium

00:27.228 --> 00:29.330
for another 50 years.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

01:07.168 --> 01:10.438
Chuck's book is
stealing our recipes
faster than ever.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.773
Well, at least
we have his book
and he doesn't.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.842
I mean, that's good.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.144
Right?

01:18.712 --> 01:21.615
Darbie, how could you
possibly be tired

01:21.682 --> 01:22.616
at a time like this?

01:22.683 --> 01:24.485
Easy. I was
up all night reading

01:24.552 --> 01:26.220
"Doomed Rainbow
at Midnight."

01:26.287 --> 01:27.921
"Doomed Rainbow at Midnight"?

01:27.988 --> 01:30.658
Uh, hello.
It's Trudith Winters'
new book.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.860
The world's
only been waiting
two years for it.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.628
Yeah, not a fan.

01:34.695 --> 01:38.031
Especially after being
PB&J BFFs with her.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.167
So, how was it?

01:39.233 --> 01:41.269
A-mazing.
And get this.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.171
She even used some of my ideas,

01:43.237 --> 01:46.039
like the feather speakers
hiding out on sad Earth.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.642
I forgot how much
I hate those books.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.053
But I'm really happy
for you, Darbie.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.579
Thanks.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.747
Did you hear that, Kelly?
Some of Darbie's ideas

01:53.814 --> 01:56.550
made it into
Trudith Winter's book.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.387
Yeah, that's great, Darbie.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.390
What's wrong?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.456
Look.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.761
I thought that
the book went on forever.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.531
Apparently not,
and we're reaching the end.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.634
It's gonna be empty soon.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.812
Staring at it
won't make it stop.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.351
How did Chuck
get this book in
the first place?

02:30.418 --> 02:32.220
It looks like he made it out of

02:32.253 --> 02:34.222
tree bark or something.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.023
Say what you want about Chuck.

02:36.089 --> 02:37.225
He's handy.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.092
Is there anything we could do?

02:39.227 --> 02:41.061
I feel so helpless.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.396
There is.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.131
We can destroy Chuck's book.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.234
He can't keep stealing
our recipes

02:46.300 --> 02:47.801
if there's nowhere
for them to go.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.638
But if we destroy Chuck's book,

02:50.704 --> 02:52.406
won't we lose our recipes
forever?

02:52.473 --> 02:55.409
I don't like it either,
but what choice do we have?

02:55.476 --> 02:58.246
No magic is better than

02:58.312 --> 02:59.780
the magic being in
the wrong hands.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.248
It won't be easy.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.083
I'm sure he's got
protections on it.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.252
We'll just have to break them.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.563
"Lay Waste
Lunar Lollipops."

03:15.629 --> 03:17.365
"To destroy what's not wanted,

03:17.431 --> 03:18.799
"melt candy to stick,

03:18.866 --> 03:20.601
"and in the light of the moon,

03:20.668 --> 03:23.271
"end it all with a lick."

03:23.304 --> 03:26.274
I'm not really a lollipop fan.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.942
I'm more of
a chocolate kind of girl.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.611
But I'm game.

03:30.678 --> 03:33.547
"When colors mix,
three combined
will make dark,

03:33.614 --> 03:36.584
"when light is added,
three colors will spark."

03:36.650 --> 03:39.953
Spark?
What does that mean?

03:40.020 --> 03:41.655
Only one way to find out.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.893
"Corn syrup, Cream of Tartar,

03:45.959 --> 03:47.861
"Kalimba cane sugar."

03:47.928 --> 03:49.697
I've never heard of that before.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.932
Me, neither.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.334
Mama P.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.429
What are you doing?
It's crazy busy out there.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.721
I need help.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.389
You said you wanted
more responsibility,

04:15.456 --> 04:16.656
now you got it.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.091
More responsibility doesn't mean

04:18.158 --> 04:19.993
one person doing all the work.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.928
Relax, I'm coming.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.339
- Excuse me.
- Um, Mama P,

04:31.405 --> 04:32.806
we need to talk to you.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.508
Privately.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.110
Follow me, girls.
Be right back, Jake.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.980
What?
You gotta be kidding me.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.785
Kalimba cane sugar.
Why do you need that?

04:44.852 --> 04:47.054
We just need it,
and right away, please.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.689
Kalimba's an element spice,

04:48.756 --> 04:52.660
so it has something to do
with earth, wind or fire.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.828
Are you trying to
control the weather?

04:54.895 --> 04:57.898
- We can do that?
- Wait a minute.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.467
Fire?

04:59.533 --> 05:01.469
We saw fire in our dream
with the Traveler.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.036
Excuse me, dream?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.438
That's right.
We did, Hannah.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.240
And a page from the book
was burning.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.377
Maybe we're supposed to
burn Chuck's book.

05:11.111 --> 05:14.382
We really need
the Kalimba cane sugar,
Mama P.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.584
I don't know.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.951
I can't believe I'm saying this,

05:18.018 --> 05:21.188
but I'm calling
your Grandma and Gina.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.491
We need to have a meeting.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.793
Are you out of your mind?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.937
You saw what happened
when I tried to destroy
the book.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.730
It fought back.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.398
Well, yeah, but
it's not our book,
it's Chuck's.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.066
Even worse.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.269
Our book is so thin,
you wouldn't even
recognize it.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.772
- It's very sad.
- Becky's right.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.408
We have to find
a different way
to save the book.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.010
We've tried, nothing's worked.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.979
I say let 'em destroy
Chuck's book.

05:46.046 --> 05:46.880
Ida!

05:46.947 --> 05:50.083
What, Becky?
You have another idea?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.452
Gina?

05:51.519 --> 05:52.753
I didn't think so.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.822
We're the protectors
of the book.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.090
Everyone before us,
including the three of you,

05:57.157 --> 05:58.291
did their job.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.427
Now we have to do ours.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.595
That's true.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.799
Be careful.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.638
Good.
Everyone's here.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.042
What do you want?

06:15.108 --> 06:16.276
I think you know.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.912
Lunch special?
Soup's chicken noodle.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.948
I'm not in the mood for games.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.584
I want my cookbook,
and my morbium.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.052
Now.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.454
I should have known.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.221
You stole back your morbium.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.324
No wonder you offered
to stay behind
in Chuck's trailer.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.060
I don't see what
the big deal is.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.262
I just took back what's mine.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.764
You should have let us know.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.532
Discuss this on your own time.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.333
Come on.
Let's go.

06:40.468 --> 06:43.471
Forget it, Chuck.
We're not about to
give you anything.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.172
Face it.
You lost.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.374
You're making a mistake.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.142
Get out.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.311
Okay.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.846
If that's how you all feel.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.682
Just remember,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.584
you brought this on yourselves.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.764
What did you do?

07:10.831 --> 07:12.600
I feel exhausted
all of a sudden.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.101
You should.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.770
I just cursed you
with a sleep spell.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.105
So, give me my stuff back,

07:18.171 --> 07:19.640
and I'll give you
the counter spell.

07:19.707 --> 07:20.874
- Not happening.
- Never.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.810
No way.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.177
Okay.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.513
But the second you fall asleep,

07:25.579 --> 07:28.048
you'll be asleep for a year.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.350
And I don't think
it'll be hard to find
my stuff then.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.521
You know where to find me.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.195
I can't stand that kid.

07:42.262 --> 07:45.098
So, what are we gonna do?

07:45.165 --> 07:46.767
Now I'm double tired.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.702
Why'd I have to
stay up all night reading?

07:48.769 --> 07:51.204
We need to find a counter spell.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.940
And soon.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.975
There must be
a recipe in the book
we can use.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.645
I'm not so sure.
It's nearly empty.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.312
Chuck's stolen everything.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.749
What about Chuck's book?

08:01.815 --> 08:04.351
He has our recipes.
We should be able to
cook them.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.588
It don't think it'd work.
They're in Chuck's book.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.590
He's the protector, not you.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.625
She's right.
And if we try

08:11.692 --> 08:13.561
there could be consequences.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.029
Who knows what protections
he put on it.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.999
Well, maybe we can
split up into two groups.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.569
That will double our chances
of defeating Chuck.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.403
That's a good idea.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.748
The three of us
will go to Kelly's,

08:24.772 --> 08:26.239
and see if there's
a counter spell

08:26.306 --> 08:28.441
in what's left of our book.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.811
And we can go to my place
and try to improvise one.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.479
Yeah.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.115
My parents will be at
Buddy's karate tournament
until 8:00.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.784
How late are they gonna be?

08:36.850 --> 08:39.587
It's already, like,
2 a.m.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.022
It's lunch time, Hannah.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.456
Oh, boy.

08:43.591 --> 08:46.159
Let's go.
We don't have
a minute to waste.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.163
Back from my deliveries.
Did I miss anything?

08:50.230 --> 08:51.832
You're in charge.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.301
Wait. When are you
gonna be back?

08:54.367 --> 08:57.638
Either in an hour, or a year.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.781
What is this music?
It's terrible.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.983
It's the Blast Jackets'
latest album.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.919
Maybe the worst music
I've ever heard.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.621
Then why are we listening to it?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.422
Try falling asleep to it.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.160
There are hardly
any recipes left.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.529
"Speed Sprinting Stromboli."

09:22.630 --> 09:23.897
For when you're running late.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.498
You could use that, Darbie.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.467
I'm not always late.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.502
Okay, well, sometimes I'm late.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.504
Actually,
most of the time I'm late.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.240
I think I just hurt
my own argument.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.675
I don't know, I'm so tired.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.043
You don't seem tired.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.754
Well, that's because
I just did 20 push ups,

09:37.778 --> 09:39.479
and some basic dance moves.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.081
The endorphins keep me awake.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.351
Uh, guys, look.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.919
What's the recipe?

09:45.986 --> 09:49.656
It... It's not a recipe,
it's a drawing.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.124
The book has never
done this before.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.161
I guess it has more than
just recipes in it.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.729
Who is she?

09:55.796 --> 09:58.131
I don't know,
but it's super creepy.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.802
Yeah. This is gonna
keep me awake for a while.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.072
I don't see anything
to help us stay awake,

10:05.138 --> 10:07.875
or counter Chuck's sleep spell.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.143
Well, this music
isn't helping any.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.545
Really? You don't find
Beethoven energizing?

10:12.612 --> 10:16.950
No. That's why they
play classical music
in the dentist's office.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.187
And can you turn
the dimmer up on the lights?

10:20.253 --> 10:23.456
I don't have a dimmer,
they're as bright as they get.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.126
Dim lights, classical music,

10:26.193 --> 10:28.929
the heat turned up
to 400 degrees.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.130
If I didn't know any better,

10:30.197 --> 10:31.799
I'd guess an old lady
lives here.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.967
We're the same age, Ida.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.206
Hey. Remember when
we had to stay awake

10:39.272 --> 10:42.575
to study for that
geometry test in tenth grade?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.144
What spell did we use?

10:44.211 --> 10:47.247
Both:
Stay Upside Down Cake.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.581
With Merwaldian sugar.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.284
No, it was Merwaldian
spring berries.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.886
That's right.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.688
It worked once,
it can work again

10:54.755 --> 10:57.624
Even spelled,
you barely passed
that test, Becky.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.193
I'm good with words,
not with rhomboids.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.096
Whatever those are.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.398
It's been 50 years
since we cooked together.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.502
I can handle twice a century.

11:09.569 --> 11:10.569
Let's do it.

11:10.603 --> 11:11.905
Becky,

11:11.972 --> 11:15.142
- the pans are...
- To the left of the oven.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.609
I remember.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.779
And Ida, I have some spices...

11:18.846 --> 11:21.248
Under the cushion.
I know.

11:21.314 --> 11:25.919
You're not the only one
with a cool secret pantry.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.761
Who do you guys
think this is?

11:33.827 --> 11:36.429
One of the OCs
when they were young?

11:36.496 --> 11:38.231
It's hard to tell
with her eyes closed,

11:38.298 --> 11:40.868
but it doesn't look
like one of them.

11:41.969 --> 11:45.638
Okay. I know I'm tired,
but...

11:45.773 --> 11:48.375
her eyes are open now, right?

11:48.441 --> 11:51.344
Okay, this is getting weird.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.781
Getting weird?

11:53.814 --> 11:54.882
Change again.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.349
Come on, do it.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.584
Darbie, stop it.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.219
This is serious.

11:59.286 --> 12:02.155
The book obviously
wants us to know
about this girl.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.791
Right now, when we're exhausted?

12:04.792 --> 12:06.794
Just say what you mean!

12:06.860 --> 12:10.063
Sorry, I'm a little cranky.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.200
Whoa, the picture changed again.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.802
She has a flower
in her hair.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.637
Darbie:
It looks like a rose.

12:17.704 --> 12:20.040
Rose!

12:20.107 --> 12:23.811
That's what the Traveler said
to Grandma in her dream.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.249
And who was that girl

12:29.316 --> 12:31.618
who sat behind you
in History class,

12:31.684 --> 12:33.453
and tried to copy your answers?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.222
Oh, uh...
Kimberly Henderson.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.990
- Yeah.
- Oh, and she had
that ridiculous

12:37.057 --> 12:39.692
bouffant hairdo.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.537
The only way we could
stop her from cheating

12:41.561 --> 12:44.865
was to cook a
Scramble Her Vision
Bacon and Eggs.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.202
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.939
Okay, I think we're
almost done.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.208
All we need now are
Merwaldian spring berries.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.649
Someone stole my
Merwaldian spring berries.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.853
Someone who wears
a size 10 Converse.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.322
He's one step
ahead of us.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.892
How'd he know we'd
try and cook this?

13:13.360 --> 13:17.530
You know who also
had to stay awake for
that geometry test?

13:17.597 --> 13:19.666
- Chuck.
- Ohh.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.434
I gotta hand it to you, Gina.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.370
You taught him how to cook well.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.737
I know.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.307
I am truly sorry about that.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.342
Eh.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.944
We were just kids.

13:32.779 --> 13:36.483
We did our best.
He was manipulative.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.885
Thanks.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.355
The sketch of the girl
was in here,

13:42.422 --> 13:43.523
we all saw her.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.626
Chuck's book must have
taken that page.

13:46.693 --> 13:50.363
You'll never find it now.
His book is getting bigger
by the second.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.305
Miss Silvers!

13:58.371 --> 13:59.572
Thank you.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.910
I hate to say it, guys,
but we're out of time.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.744
We have to give Chuck
what he wants.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.981
Grandma.
We can't give up.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.984
Kelly, we don't have a choice.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.120
We're out of options.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.388
And I'm not gonna
let you girls
hurt yourselves.

14:15.455 --> 14:19.092
There still is one thing
we haven't done.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.293
Cook from Chuck's book.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.996
We've already discussed it.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.999
We're not the protectors,
it won't work.

14:26.066 --> 14:29.536
I know, I know,
but we could be wrong.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.603
These are our recipes,

14:30.670 --> 14:31.939
we have to at least try.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.273
She has a point.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.676
I suppose it's worth a shot.

14:36.743 --> 14:39.947
Better make it quick,
I'm not gonna last
much longer.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.157
Okay, let's see,
we need to find something

14:41.181 --> 14:43.183
to counteract Chuck's spell.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.485
All right, uh,
"Never Feeling
Funnel Cakes."

14:45.552 --> 14:46.319
No.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.955
"Portrait Painting
Pinwheels."

14:47.988 --> 14:52.425
Maybe your morbium
would help the situation,
Ida.

14:52.492 --> 14:56.129
Morbium is an amplifier,
not a cure-all.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.099
You, of all people,
should know that, Becky.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.500
What does that mean?

15:00.567 --> 15:01.668
Nothing.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.972
"Wide Awake Beef Wellington,"

15:05.005 --> 15:06.239
that's perfect.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.840
"When you need to stay awake,

15:07.975 --> 15:09.409
"whether it is day or night,

15:09.476 --> 15:11.078
"set aside some hours to bake

15:11.144 --> 15:12.745
"this lovely
sumptuous delight."

15:12.812 --> 15:16.849
We need Livonian shallots
and Werepos salt.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.218
No problem.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.586
Kelly:
This is a hard recipe.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.189
We're gonna need to make
a puff pastry, and...

15:22.255 --> 15:23.566
And crepes, and then
we're gonna need

15:23.590 --> 15:27.427
chicken liver pÃ¢tÃ©,
mushrooms and shallots.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.494
It'll take a while.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.731
The good news is
we have 12 hands.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.691
Oh, no.

15:58.758 --> 15:59.758
What?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.036
I don't understand.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.737
I do.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.174
Like I said before,
Chuck is the protector
of the book.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.675
We can't cook from it.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.744
If I had any energy,

16:17.810 --> 16:19.646
I'd be really angry right now.

16:19.712 --> 16:20.947
What are we gonna do?

16:21.048 --> 16:22.215
Darbie:
While we're thinking,

16:22.282 --> 16:24.551
would it be okay if
I put on a pair of PJs,

16:24.617 --> 16:26.519
you know, just to be
comfortable?

16:26.586 --> 16:29.189
No comfy PJs.

16:29.256 --> 16:32.692
Nothing comfy at all.
We all have to stay awake.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.927
We're going to fall asleep.

16:35.062 --> 16:39.666
And Chuck will take back
the morbium and the book.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.735
We might as well just
give them to him.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.971
But we're the protectors.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.306
We can't just let him have it.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.075
Kelly.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.713
Think about your parents.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.182
Remember how stressed they were

16:55.248 --> 16:57.083
when I was under a spell,
and I couldn't talk?

16:57.084 --> 16:58.851
Yeah.

16:58.918 --> 17:02.289
Imagine how they'll feel
when they can't wake you up
for a year.

17:05.724 --> 17:07.960
You're right.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.097
I guess Chuck wins.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.106
Wow.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.174
You guys look really tired.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.542
Ready to give me
my book and my morbium?

17:25.112 --> 17:27.946
Are you ready to cook
a counter spell?

17:28.013 --> 17:29.549
Already cooked it.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.295
Huh. Wide Awake
Beef Wellington.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.603
Well, I'm wide awake.
Everyone else?

18:25.638 --> 18:26.773
We failed.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.641
All those protectors
had the book before us,

18:28.708 --> 18:30.343
but we're the ones
who let it down.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.446
Oh, you didn't fail, Kelly.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.216
You did everything you could.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.551
I'm proud of you.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.354
I feel terrible about
teaching that boy magic.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.656
Can't this pity party wait?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.358
We have bigger issues at play.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.195
Like how Chuck
now has all the power.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.305
What's he gonna do with it?

18:49.329 --> 18:51.198
Whatever he wants.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.332
We can't stop him.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.100
I wish I'd used my morbium seed

18:54.201 --> 18:56.203
before he had a chance
to take it back.

18:56.269 --> 18:59.839
Forget your morbium, Ida,
it's not all about you.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.208
Oh, you're one to talk, Becky.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.776
You couldn't have been
more selfish

19:03.843 --> 19:05.712
about your morbium.

19:05.778 --> 19:06.913
What do you mean?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.681
Tell her, Becky.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.418
If you're so proud of yourself.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.320
It's nothing, Kelly,
forget about it.

19:13.386 --> 19:16.556
No, Grandma,
I'm not gonna forget it.

19:16.623 --> 19:19.225
I'm tired of you
keeping secrets.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.793
I deserve to know what you did.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.598
All right.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.401
The book tore
the three of us apart,

19:28.468 --> 19:30.337
and I'd had enough.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.572
After these two
cursed each other,

19:32.639 --> 19:36.876
I used my morbium to
break our protectorship
of the book.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.077
What?

19:39.111 --> 19:40.313
Whoa.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.914
Can you even do that?

19:41.981 --> 19:43.683
No, you can't.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.253
That's why Becky
had to use her morbium.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.788
To amplify a separation spell.

19:48.855 --> 19:52.158
A person doesn't choose
when the book comes to them.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.526
Or when the book moves on.

19:54.861 --> 19:58.565
Grandma, you interfered with
the natural order of magic.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.067
I would be horrified
if Darbie or Kelly

20:01.268 --> 20:02.702
separated us from the book.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.036
So would I.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.606
But we would never do that.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.477
I did what I had to do.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.246
It wasn't your decision
to make, Becky.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.782
The book decides
when it moves on.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.251
The book belonged to
all three of us.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.455
I cannot believe you lied to me.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.124
You told me that Chuck
stole your morbium.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.126
What else have you been
lying to me about?

20:27.193 --> 20:28.661
- Kelly...
- No, Grandma.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.331
I really don't want to be
around you right now.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.610
Come on, Kelly,
I know you're upset,

20:43.676 --> 20:45.912
but she's still your grandma.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.348
I know.
It's weird,

20:48.415 --> 20:50.783
I was doing
everything I could
to save the book,

20:50.850 --> 20:53.886
and Grandma was doing
everything she could
to destroy it.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.221
Yeah, it's ironic.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.924
In a bad sort of way, of course.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.332
It's so sad.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.135
There's only one recipe left.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.704
"Lay Waste
Lunar Lollipops."

21:11.771 --> 21:13.473
Guys, I think we should cook it.

21:14.907 --> 21:15.808
What's the point?

21:15.875 --> 21:18.177
That was to destroy
Chuck's book.

21:18.244 --> 21:20.079
We don't have
Chuck's book anymore.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.156
But there must be a reason

21:21.180 --> 21:22.915
the book saved this for last.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.350
The riddle says that

21:24.351 --> 21:26.686
we should lick the lollipops
in the light of the moon,

21:26.753 --> 21:29.456
and it's finally nighttime.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.191
And there's a big, bright moon.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.360
Do you still have
the Kalimba cane sugar?

21:34.361 --> 21:37.129
Mm-hm.

21:37.196 --> 21:38.230
Let's cook.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.732
It might be our last time.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.393
- Ready?
- Ready for what?

22:07.394 --> 22:08.761
I don't even know
what we're doing.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.263
We're doing what the book
wants us to do.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.899
I think.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.767
Okay.
Here we go.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.840
Whoa!

22:20.907 --> 22:22.742
They're like mini spotlights.

22:22.809 --> 22:23.576
So, now what?

22:23.643 --> 22:25.177
Remember the riddle?

22:25.244 --> 22:28.114
"When colors mix,
three combined
will make dark.

22:28.180 --> 22:32.752
"When light is added,
three colors will spark."

22:32.819 --> 22:33.819
Come on.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.327
Hannah.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.930
Put your light on top of mine.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.031
Wow.

22:45.097 --> 22:46.097
Now you, Darbie.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.035
Awesome.

22:52.338 --> 22:54.006
Something's happening.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.613
Remember our dream?

23:00.680 --> 23:02.449
A page from the book
was on fire.

23:02.515 --> 23:05.084
The Traveler told us that
we had to protect the book.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.819
But how?

23:09.789 --> 23:12.959
Chuck's book took our
Lay Waste Lunar Lollipop
recipe.

23:13.025 --> 23:16.663
Well, yeah, Chuck's book
takes all of our recipes.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.865
Our book is magic.

23:18.931 --> 23:22.268
Chuck's book is magic.
These recipes are magic.

23:22.334 --> 23:25.705
This fire is magic.

23:25.772 --> 23:28.775
If Chuck's book
steals our magic recipes,

23:28.841 --> 23:31.043
- then...
- It might steal
a magic fire?

23:32.745 --> 23:36.048
This is the book's
final protection.

23:36.115 --> 23:39.752
It wants to keep the magic
from the wrong hands.

23:39.819 --> 23:42.522
Are we really doing this?

23:42.589 --> 23:44.957
We don't have any other options.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.093
What if it doesn't work?

23:48.795 --> 23:50.730
Then there's no stopping Chuck.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.597
Rose.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.238
Something's happening.

24:51.724 --> 24:52.925
The fire's gone.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.131
No!

25:14.781 --> 25:16.983
Look.
The spells are back.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.120
"Miso Person's Soup."

25:21.187 --> 25:22.755
"Shut 'Em Up Shortcake."

25:22.822 --> 25:25.592
"Settle The Beef
Sandwich."

25:25.658 --> 25:26.658
We did it.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.160
Yeah, we did.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.227
Oh, my gosh.
