02:03.123 --> 02:06.585
The land with flag is now yours.

02:12.341 --> 02:16.095
I just bought a piece of land
vast enough for a horse to run all day.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.190
Hello. How are you?

03:16.906 --> 03:18.157
Look at this place,

03:18.908 --> 03:21.827
and the land too.

03:21.911 --> 03:25.581
How big it is?

03:26.498 --> 03:29.752
If you're willing to buy at a lower price,

03:31.253 --> 03:34.340
I will give double your pay.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.984
I told you many times,

03:54.568 --> 03:58.280
"People can't settle
on the land you purchase."

03:58.864 --> 04:02.201
I can do nothing
with a decree from heaven.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.163
We will take care of that.

04:07.539 --> 04:08.999
No problem at all.

04:09.875 --> 04:10.876
How?

04:14.213 --> 04:15.339
With money.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.525
There's a lot you can do with money.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.738
Life was different when I was poor.

Jump properly, will you?

05:25.492 --> 05:28.620
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

05:28.704 --> 05:29.705
Higher!

05:31.123 --> 05:32.708
Do it properly!

05:32.791 --> 05:34.376
Yes, sir!

Hey, got any plans? I'll come with,
if you're going someplace nice.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.413
One thing's for sure:
I'm never coming back here.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.459
All those bugs and fungi--
This is not a place for humans.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.132
Then do you want to follow those guys?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.052
We won't have to worry about food
or a place to sleep.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.106
I heard you can fight.

06:38.649 --> 06:42.111
If I'm up against more than three,
I just get beat up.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.906
Come with me. Let me buy you a drink.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.200
I have other plans.

Nobody wanted me except good-for-nothings.

07:39.543 --> 07:40.794
I had nowhere to go.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.959
I don't remember my childhood.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.420
After I lost my parents,

08:23.503 --> 08:27.257
eating and sleeping was

09:24.231 --> 09:26.400
I wore this even as I was raising you.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.027
How can you move
without telling your brother?

09:29.111 --> 09:31.488
Did you tell me when you went to juvie?

09:32.739 --> 09:33.782
You're right.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.410
Where's Tae-chun?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.662
The bookstore.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.589
Hey, bookworm.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.800
Uncle!

09:52.592 --> 09:53.969
Jang Tae-chun!

09:54.761 --> 09:55.887
Oh, boy.

09:57.681 --> 10:00.767
You bookworm! You smarty-pants!
You been well?

10:00.851 --> 10:02.561
Did the fishing ships arrive?

10:02.644 --> 10:05.814
Of course. We caught a bunch of tuna.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.774
Mom's not done with work yet.

10:07.858 --> 10:10.235
She says she's coming home early today.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.863
Let's go.
I'll buy you chicken. Your favorite.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.865
Did you make a lot of money?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.826
So much money. Let's order two flavors.

10:17.909 --> 10:22.080
Buy me books instead of chicken
so I can read them at home at night.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.335
My little bookworm.
Which book do you want to read?

10:29.671 --> 10:32.007
They're 1,600,000 won each.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.843
But this one is 990,000 won.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.975
A little expensive, huh?

10:42.726 --> 10:45.187
Don't you worry about money with me.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.317
-Let's buy a new one.
-Really? Really?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.152
Oh, yeah!

10:52.235 --> 10:54.363
Tae-chun, you're excited today.

10:54.446 --> 10:58.533
This is my uncle.
He caught bluefin tuna from the Pacific.

10:58.617 --> 10:59.993
Bluefin tuna?

11:00.077 --> 11:03.205
That's the actual name of tuna.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.750
It's in the same family as mackerels
and bonitos. I read it in a book.

11:18.553 --> 11:19.805
Here's a blanket.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.226
My adorable boy.

11:29.398 --> 11:31.358
There's something about family.

11:32.275 --> 11:38.115
When he grabbed my hand,
something tugged at my heartstrings.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.078
He was probably happy to see you
and not the ladies from the teahouse.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.455
This boy.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.290
What will do you now?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.918
Stop fishing for tuna.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.045
People like us,

11:53.463 --> 11:55.966
we don't have a lot of options.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.219
I can't help you like before.
You're second fiddle now.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.055

12:25.495 --> 12:29.833

I'll be his father figure.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.335
You? A father figure?

12:32.419 --> 12:35.964
Being a dad isn't a big deal.
Being the breadwinner is all it is.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.800
Fine. Please do.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.760
I want to get in on that.

12:41.803 --> 12:45.599
First, let's get you a bigger apartment.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.809
One with two bathrooms.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.109
I decided to make money.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.361
As much as possible.

13:01.656 --> 13:05.160
I knew you'd come.
You seemed like you would.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.454
Will I make a lot of money?

13:07.537 --> 13:11.500
It depends on how well you do.
Do what I ask. Then you will.

13:13.251 --> 13:18.173
Did you really memorize my pager digits
at one glance?

13:18.256 --> 13:20.717

Been like that since I was a kid.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.149
Kid's fascinating--

13:39.361 --> 13:42.197
We got a job. Let's get to work!

13:46.493 --> 13:48.245
Let's go. Come on!

Goodbye.

-Get 'em!

14:06.096 --> 14:07.472

14:07.556 --> 14:08.932

15:06.156 --> 15:09.576
Hey, Tae-chun is so excited.
He loves them.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.787
Is it Uncle? Let me talk to him. Let me.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.624
Uncle, you're the best!

15:15.707 --> 15:17.083
Thank you!

15:17.167 --> 15:19.669
Hey, Jang Tae-chun, the bookworm!

15:19.753 --> 15:23.715
Uncle's going to earn the money,
so you just study hard, okay?

15:25.008 --> 15:29.346
This weekend we're going to
the new amusement park in Jamsil!

15:29.429 --> 15:30.555
Let's go!

15:33.475 --> 15:34.476
Get ready!

15:35.602 --> 15:36.770
Let's go!

16:07.258 --> 16:09.511

16:13.431 --> 16:15.100

16:15.183 --> 16:17.811
You have to block them.
If you don't, we all die!

16:43.044 --> 16:45.422
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

16:45.505 --> 16:46.798
Damn bastards!

16:59.519 --> 17:00.729
Get out!

18:12.675 --> 18:13.676
Shit.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.557
What is this mess?

19:03.518 --> 19:04.853
Look, Mr. Park.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.772
Let's be gentlemen about this.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.482
You damn thief!

19:09.566 --> 19:12.735
I was late on my interest payments,
so you're stealing the construction deal?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.195
What nonsense is this?

19:14.279 --> 19:16.114
My goodness.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.449
You were the one who asked me for a loan.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.870
You weren't forced to use my money, right?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.501
Chairman.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.212
Please, wait just a bit longer. I'll…

19:31.296 --> 19:33.506
Please, wait a little longer.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.758
I'll do anything to pay you back!

19:35.842 --> 19:38.177
Know your place, you bastard.

19:39.762 --> 19:40.847
Chairman.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.437
I do things according to law.

19:50.648 --> 19:54.360
You sign it over to me,
and let's finish this amicably.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.452
Myung In-ju,
Myeongdong's godfather of loan sharks.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.540
Known as the Gentleman of Myeongdong,

20:07.624 --> 20:10.585
but his notoriety in business
is anything but gentlemanly.

20:21.012 --> 20:24.682
We can't let him go home like this.
Take him to the sauna to wash up.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.687
You, let's talk.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.698
-Eun Yong, was it?
-Yes.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.369
-Today was tough, wasn't it?
-It was fine.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.788
This is all you get.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.207
Take it when I give it to you.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.004
Without money, you become nothing.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.715
You become scum, like that fool.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.595
-You have a license?
-Yes.

21:03.471 --> 21:09.185
My former chauffeur stole money from me,

21:10.061 --> 21:11.688
so I cut off his hands.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.149
He'll have to drive one-handed now.

21:22.198 --> 21:25.410
Seong-tae tells me
you memorize numbers well.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.788
He tells me you get the job done.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.125
Do you want to stay as Seong-tae's fist?

21:33.626 --> 21:36.462
Or do you want to follow me,
a merchant of money?

21:37.964 --> 21:40.133
A real opportunity has arrived.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.885
I'll work for you.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.139
All right.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.357
Oh, come on!

21:56.441 --> 21:58.568
-You lost.
-I mean, but why?

21:59.193 --> 22:02.155
-Oh, a motorbike!
-Hurry! Let's go home and…

22:04.574 --> 22:06.909
-Yo, Jang Tae-chun!
-Uncle!

22:11.372 --> 22:14.125
Uncle Yong was always busy,
so whenever he paid a visit,

22:14.625 --> 22:16.335
I was always so happy.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.183
Let's go.

22:30.933 --> 22:34.854
Uncle Yong never kept his promise
to take me to the amusement park.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.230
You home?

22:36.314 --> 22:39.734
But he really bought us an apartment
with two bathrooms.

22:42.195 --> 22:45.156
Yong, I think I might cry.

22:45.239 --> 22:49.077
Stop fussing. It's nothing.
Come here. Look at the back.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.453
Come here, yeah?

22:53.748 --> 22:57.710
-Wow. Look at the sunshine.
-So amazing.

22:57.794 --> 23:02.381
When Uncle started making money,
Mom quit her job at the teahouse.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.300
She opened her own place.

23:05.176 --> 23:07.386
She went from being a service girl
at Yeokjeon Teahouse

23:07.470 --> 23:09.347
to a madam at the Forget-Me-Not Bar.

23:14.268 --> 23:17.146
She still wore thick makeup,
left home at night,

23:18.523 --> 23:20.525
and came home drunk in the morning.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.574
Seong-tae.

23:30.284 --> 23:31.702
Seong-tae.

23:37.125 --> 23:41.003
My goal was to enter law school
and become a prosecutor.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.089
LAW SCHOOL

23:43.172 --> 23:48.344
But since I wasn't too bright,
I barely got into a rural law school.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.639
I studied for the bar
before I even started college.

23:52.265 --> 23:53.599
All I did was study.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.019
The bar is more about patience
and persistence than brains.

23:57.103 --> 24:00.773
It's a test of endurance
towards your goal.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.616
I wanted to succeed

24:11.784 --> 24:13.244
more than anything.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.331
A prosecutor punishing forces of evil

24:18.416 --> 24:19.876
in the most awesome way.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.871
You didn't fail to make the list
because you lack the skill.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.540
Han, that bastard--

25:00.166 --> 25:02.501
He's church buddies with the commissioner.

25:04.045 --> 25:06.672
HAN SEOK-WON, 30TH CLASS

25:07.757 --> 25:10.927
All right, man. Cheer up.
I'll see you next month.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.721
All right. Talk to you later.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.058
JUSTICE AND JOY TO SOCIETY

25:17.141 --> 25:19.727
Cheers! Mr. Former Deputy Chief.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.437
Chief Han.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.065
Your task force is up for change. Amen.

25:26.317 --> 25:29.654
Our chief just got a promotion.

25:29.737 --> 25:32.323
What else matters?
Of course I'll be there.

25:33.074 --> 25:34.075
Yes.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.328
I'll see you Thursday.

25:38.579 --> 25:41.791
Chief Han, I love you.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.334
Yes. Talk soon.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.474
Good morning, Chief.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.768
HWANG GI-SEOK - CHIEF PROSECUTOR
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS

26:00.851 --> 26:03.396
-Who are you?
-Jang Tae-chun, 40th class of the Bureau.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.606
We met last time we all went out.

26:05.690 --> 26:06.691
Oh?

26:07.400 --> 26:10.027
Did I see you at a reunion?
Which class are you?

26:10.111 --> 26:12.822
Not Seoul University.
I'm from Gwangjin University.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.574
-We went to drink after a meeting--
-Gwangjin University?

26:16.784 --> 26:18.577
Never heard of it.

26:18.661 --> 26:21.706
The way you dealt with
Han Kwang-yeon's case,

26:21.789 --> 26:23.457
it was truly inspiring--

26:23.541 --> 26:25.710
Okay, okay. Thank you.

26:26.502 --> 26:29.714
I'll work hard to join your department
and become your junior--

26:29.797 --> 26:32.258
Hey, what did you say your name was?

26:33.217 --> 26:35.928
-Jang Tae-chun.
-Who says I'll be your senior?

26:37.847 --> 26:39.598
Who do you think you are?

26:41.684 --> 26:43.311
I'm sorry.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.021
No need to apologize.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.527
You keep it up.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.198
Have a good day.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.546
Prosecutor Choi is on sick leave.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.174
You take care of
the police dispatch cases.

27:14.508 --> 27:17.386
You're dumping petty crimes
and shit cases on me again.

27:17.470 --> 27:18.929
Hey.

27:19.013 --> 27:23.517
Every case is urgent
and important to the victims.

27:25.144 --> 27:29.315
Okay, I'll be sure to finish these cases
without error or mishap.

27:29.398 --> 27:32.443
Listen, kid.
Prosecutors don't discriminate.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.157
Speaking of which,
can you sign off on this case?

27:38.240 --> 27:40.409
It's about Assemblyman Baek's son.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.162
It's a critical case
for the youth born into poverty.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.916
He was given an advantage
in the company's hiring process?

27:47.541 --> 27:48.584
Yes.

27:48.667 --> 27:53.255
If you approve the warrant,
I'll dig enough that news stations--

27:53.339 --> 27:56.926
Do you want to join
Special Investigations that badly?

27:57.635 --> 28:00.388
Prosecutors must not get personal.

28:00.471 --> 28:04.183
-Personal feelings, greed, personal life--
-What about a personal sense of duty?

28:05.142 --> 28:09.146
-It's a typical corruption-of-power case--
-Not enough evidence.

28:09.230 --> 28:13.651
-That's why it needs to be investigated--
-This isn't a case to be taken lightly.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.236
I'll look at it later.

28:18.906 --> 28:22.993
-I'll get more information for you.
-I'll look at it. Stop for now.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.038
You don't get it, do you?

28:27.706 --> 28:28.707
I do.

28:34.547 --> 28:37.591
There's a case in that pile
that may cause a media storm.

28:39.009 --> 28:41.637
Take care of it quietly,
so it doesn't create noise.

28:48.686 --> 28:50.438
And the headline news.

28:50.521 --> 28:53.774
Last night, a driver crashed his supercar
after having a wild night.

28:53.858 --> 28:58.154
The driver was revealed to be
Lee Chang-min, a famous stock investor,

28:58.237 --> 29:00.030
also known as Yeouido Rambo.

29:00.114 --> 29:03.826
I am Rambo. Money is proof of my skill.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.287
Subscribers, trust Rambo
and shoot your ammunition.

29:06.370 --> 29:10.916
Rambo's 100,000,000-won
investment tutorial begins now!

29:11.625 --> 29:14.879
The online community is heating up
in a debate to guess

29:14.962 --> 29:16.964
the cost of damages to his supercar…

29:17.047 --> 29:20.676
I mean, it's still news,
but it's a puff piece.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.806
Give him the biggest fine possible
and make it a summary offense.

29:25.890 --> 29:29.727
-And Assemblyman Baek's accounts?
-You'll need your chief's approval.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.567
I'm going to eat. Have a good--

29:37.359 --> 29:38.360
Damn it.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.820
See you soon.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.375
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun?

29:53.459 --> 29:54.710
-Yes?
-Expedited delivery.

30:04.094 --> 30:07.223
PROSECUTOR JANG TAE-CHUN

I'm Rambo.

30:42.132 --> 30:46.095

from curb trading?

30:46.178 --> 30:49.890
Today's recommended unlisted stocks:

30:49.974 --> 30:51.350

31:13.372 --> 31:14.832
Can you tell what this is?

31:16.542 --> 31:20.796
I'm not sure. Something about the stocks?

31:27.136 --> 31:28.887
INVESTIGATOR NAM SANG-IL

31:32.433 --> 31:33.767
Mr. Nam Sang-il?

31:37.688 --> 31:39.898
My name is Jang Tae-chun, a prosecutor.

31:39.982 --> 31:41.108
Oh, yes?

31:42.526 --> 31:43.986
Could you look at this?

31:44.069 --> 31:45.279
Wow.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.532
Considering we've never met,
this must be urgent.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.284
You were with Special Investigations,

31:50.367 --> 31:53.454
and you're a veteran
when it comes to financial crimes.

31:54.038 --> 31:57.833
These are Solar Bio's internal documents.
Rambo mentioned this company.

31:59.168 --> 32:00.586
You know Yeouido Rambo well?

32:01.462 --> 32:04.715
When I was with Special Investigations,
I proposed he be investigated.

32:05.424 --> 32:09.511
This little rat. We should have caught him
when we had the chance.

32:10.846 --> 32:13.766
Did you find anything on him
during your investigations?

32:15.976 --> 32:18.896
We didn't even launch the investigation.
The prosecutor was preoccupied.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.148
Who was the prosecutor in charge?

32:24.068 --> 32:25.653
Chief Prosecutor Hwang Gi-seok.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.371
I think you get my drift.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.499
Don't waste your energy.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.352
HAN WON-CHEOL
ATTORNEY GENERAL

32:58.435 --> 33:00.270
-Hey, Chief Hwang.
-Yes.

33:00.354 --> 33:03.023
The senior secretary for civil affairs
wants to see you.

33:03.107 --> 33:06.193
Right. About the new-hire prospects.

33:07.611 --> 33:10.364
I think he got in trouble
with the president.

33:10.447 --> 33:12.366
He didn't take care of his own.

33:12.449 --> 33:15.202
Yes. I assumed it was about that.

33:18.038 --> 33:19.123
Here you are.

33:20.374 --> 33:22.209
Twenty parcels of land in Yongin,

33:22.292 --> 33:24.753
bought for 3.4 billion won
under a false name.

33:25.379 --> 33:26.714
Whose land is it?

33:27.297 --> 33:29.091
Not sure. It's not mine.

33:32.636 --> 33:36.640
That damn secretary had a reason
for being so confident before me, huh?

33:37.224 --> 33:38.350
Well, I'll be!

33:39.518 --> 33:43.439
If you give this to Secretary Kim,
the president will take care of him.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.108
Hey, Gi-seok.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.611
I rearranged my office.

33:50.279 --> 33:55.075
The position of my desk is best
right over there.

33:56.910 --> 33:59.204
Oh, I see.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.332
You're going to use
this room later, right?

34:03.250 --> 34:04.918
Keep that in mind.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.550
This…

34:13.927 --> 34:16.555
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAN WON-CHEOL

34:22.060 --> 34:26.440
These days, isn't money really made
from curb trading?

34:26.523 --> 34:29.777
Which is why I, Yeouido Rambo,
present to you

34:29.860 --> 34:33.572
today's recommended unlisted stocks:

34:33.655 --> 34:34.865
Solar Bio.

34:34.948 --> 34:37.326
Solar Bio's shares are valuable

34:37.409 --> 34:40.537
because ordinary people can never get
the chance to own them.

34:40.621 --> 34:45.083
I had to beg the head honcho
to reserve some for our VVIP members.

34:46.043 --> 34:49.087
-The head honcho?
-It was a difficult feat indeed.

34:49.171 --> 34:53.967
This man slapped the face
of Korea's most powerful CEO.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.138
If Hwang Gi-seok
from Special Investigations stepped in,

34:58.972 --> 35:00.891
there must be something here.

35:00.974 --> 35:04.311
…Solar Bio. Trust Rambo and buy up!

35:04.394 --> 35:07.689
Close those tabs,
and let's go to the world!

35:07.773 --> 35:10.234
Also, this isn't enough
for an investigation.

35:10.901 --> 35:15.322
This looks like a transfer of funds,
but the numbers are strange.

35:15.948 --> 35:20.202
You have to figure out a certain number
to decode these into their real numbers.

35:21.161 --> 35:25.082
Old-timer loan sharks used bookkeeping
numbers like a code for security reasons.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.501
The same applies for this.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.716
There is an elderly loan shark
who knows this stuff.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.469
He got out of jail a while back and died.

35:38.345 --> 35:39.388
Here you are.

35:47.521 --> 35:49.523
I can think of someone who would know.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.038
Mom doesn't have to work at night?

36:05.122 --> 36:06.832
That's what I said.

36:06.915 --> 36:09.793
My investments paid off big-time.

36:09.877 --> 36:14.089
So go to college and do whatever.
Don't worry about money.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.134
I said I'm going to law school,
then I'll take the bar.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.431
But why are you buying me a suit?

36:22.973 --> 36:27.352
When a boy becomes a man,
parents get him a suit. Turn around.

36:29.438 --> 36:30.606
Looks good.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.983
Wear this to law school.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.571
-I'm a high-school senior.
-Time flies.

36:38.405 --> 36:42.034
When I'm gone, you lead the household.
Take care of your mother.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.703
Uncle, you going somewhere?

36:46.121 --> 36:48.248
I'm going to make real money now.

36:48.332 --> 36:51.835
-Once I leave Korea, I'll be a long while.
-What about my graduation?

36:53.170 --> 36:55.339
I'll stop by for that.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.426
We have to leave behind
a family picture, right?

37:02.346 --> 37:05.432
Don't make promises you can't keep.
I'll be fine.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.894
But Mom worries about you a lot.
You know that, right?

37:09.478 --> 37:11.855
Call Mom, no matter how busy you are.

37:13.023 --> 37:14.024
I will.

37:14.983 --> 37:18.236
You little punk.
You're all grown now, huh?

37:18.320 --> 37:20.238
Jang Tae-chun, you bastard.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.825
-You little punk.
-That hurts.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.246
You look good.

37:46.640 --> 37:51.144
Uncle Yong, who made big money dabbling
in moneylending and the stock business,

37:51.895 --> 37:57.192
left Korea ten years ago
to make real money out in the big world.

"Promissory note.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.290
Uncle Yong promised me on June 12

40:17.374 --> 40:19.960
he would take me, Jang Tae-chun,

40:20.502 --> 40:23.880
to the amusement park.

40:24.673 --> 40:26.550
If the promise is not kept,

40:42.399 --> 40:43.900

40:46.236 --> 40:48.822

40:48.905 --> 40:51.074
This is actually scary.

40:53.743 --> 40:54.744
Okay.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.998
I'll keep my promise this time, okay?

Jang Tae-chun, this weekend,
we're going to the amusement park.

-Let's go!
-Let's go!

41:24.024 --> 41:27.277
Let's go! Let's go!
Wait. I'm getting a phone call.

41:28.904 --> 41:30.697
Wait, wait.

41:31.323 --> 41:32.490
Hi, Chairman Park.

41:33.450 --> 41:34.826
Yes, yes.

41:36.203 --> 41:38.538
Oh, really? Okay, on my way.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.291
Okay, I'm going. Okay.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.085
See you later.

41:49.090 --> 41:50.217
Uncle, here.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.344
-Good.
-Bye.

41:54.346 --> 41:55.347
Yes.

41:56.264 --> 42:00.018
Yes, if it's for three months,
I'll give you up to 4.5.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.478
See you tomorrow.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.189
Ten from Seonjin Tech.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.608
-Two for me.
-Two.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.526
-Two for me.
-Two?

42:08.610 --> 42:10.111
-Three for me.
-Three.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.740
Mrs. Kim, will you take the last three?

42:15.116 --> 42:17.160
I'll take off my panties for you.

42:17.244 --> 42:19.454
Okay. Bang, bang, bang!

42:19.537 --> 42:21.289
Mr. Eun!

42:22.582 --> 42:23.583
Yes, Chairman?

42:23.667 --> 42:25.877
Give me the promissory note
from Odong Produce.

42:25.961 --> 42:29.214
Odong gold and silver:
13, 5, 09, 27, at 13% discount.

42:29.297 --> 42:31.007
Five-month expiration on September 27.

42:31.091 --> 42:32.384
-Is that right?
-Yes.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.723
They're coming next week,
so adjust the numbers.

42:38.807 --> 42:40.350
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.273
-Enjoy the food.
-Okay.

43:01.162 --> 43:05.542
In those times, loan sharks used numbers
like a code language.

43:05.625 --> 43:10.088
They wrote it backwards, switched odds
with evens, added the date, etcetera.

43:10.171 --> 43:11.840
There were many ways to do it.

43:15.510 --> 43:20.015
Thinking of the past, I paid off my debt
of Tae-chun's promissory note.

43:33.695 --> 43:35.488
While my uncle decoded the code

43:36.072 --> 43:38.366
all the way in Mongolia…

43:43.580 --> 43:45.915
I collected information on Solar Bio.

43:53.548 --> 43:55.759
Finally, at the break of dawn,

43:57.010 --> 43:59.220
I received a fax from Uncle.

44:03.141 --> 44:07.562
The key to decoding the numbers
in the anonymous source material was…

44:07.645 --> 44:12.025
25780.

44:12.108 --> 44:16.946
The many numbers in the document,
the key to it all, is 25780.

44:17.989 --> 44:23.995
These five digits reveal the real numbers
in Solar Bio's original document.

44:25.246 --> 44:28.917
I found each of the convertible bonds
in that list before you.

44:30.168 --> 44:33.129
So, I tell you to take care of a DUI case,

44:33.213 --> 44:35.757
but you bring me
a stock-price manipulation case?

44:35.840 --> 44:39.177
Chief, if you look
into the convertible bonds,

44:39.260 --> 44:42.222
two companies benefited
from the manipulation:

44:42.305 --> 44:45.809
Beauty Sparkle,
Rambo's girlfriend's company,

44:45.892 --> 44:47.227
and GMI Bank.

44:47.977 --> 44:51.856
Both companies have a major shareholder
whom Rambo calls "head honcho."

44:53.608 --> 44:55.693
It's Chairman Myung In-ju.

44:56.778 --> 44:58.988
This is, without a doubt, insider trading.

44:59.614 --> 45:02.450
Do you even know who Chairman Myung is?

45:02.534 --> 45:06.663
He's the master manipulator
of the stock market and a con man.

45:08.790 --> 45:10.583
Chief Hwang Gi-seok's father-in-law.

45:11.626 --> 45:13.044
Your rival.

45:19.092 --> 45:20.343
File for warrant.

45:21.845 --> 45:22.846
Yes, sir.

45:24.889 --> 45:26.307
They're here!

45:26.391 --> 45:27.517
They're coming!

45:29.727 --> 45:32.313
-Over there! In the back!
-Is it true?

45:32.397 --> 45:35.775
Lee Chang-min,
known as Yeouido Rambo, is being arrested

45:35.859 --> 45:38.194
on allegations
of stock-price manipulation.

45:38.278 --> 45:40.947
Prosecutor-in-charge Jang Tae-chun

45:41.030 --> 45:46.327
said he will be giving a brief
about what exactly took place.

45:47.495 --> 45:51.249
The dividends went to two companies:
Beauty Sparkle and GMI Bank.

45:51.332 --> 45:54.794
Although Lee's girlfriend is the owner
of Beauty Sparkle,

45:54.878 --> 45:57.964
we've confirmed that the actual CEO
is Lee himself.

45:58.798 --> 46:02.927
It is rumored that Rambo's head honcho,
Chairman Myung, was behind it all.

46:03.011 --> 46:05.346
Are you going to investigate
Chairman Myung also?

46:05.430 --> 46:08.391
What motivated you to pursue this case?

46:08.475 --> 46:12.479
What does the other company, GMI Bank,
have to do with anything?

46:12.562 --> 46:15.857
An official investigation has launched
against Chief Hwang Gi-seok

46:15.940 --> 46:19.903
and his in-law Chairman Myung's
stock-price manipulation suspicions.

46:21.654 --> 46:23.448
I knock out the chief prosecutor

46:25.033 --> 46:26.701
and go to Special Investigations.

46:27.285 --> 46:30.580
We cannot discuss further matters
of this ongoing investigation.

47:05.490 --> 47:06.533
Sir?

47:07.659 --> 47:08.660
Sir.

47:08.743 --> 47:11.955
Did you confirm
the quarterly report sent via fax?

47:12.038 --> 47:14.916
Yes. The numbers look good.

47:16.668 --> 47:19.212
Be honest. You didn't see it, did you?

47:19.295 --> 47:22.465
I can tell what the numbers are
by hearing your voice.

47:22.549 --> 47:26.511
How long are you going to be stuck
at that place?

47:26.594 --> 47:30.807
Our biggest investors would really like
to see our chairman's face.

47:30.890 --> 47:32.517
Why do they need to see my face?

47:32.600 --> 47:35.770
It's better for both sides
if I stay here and buy more land.

47:36.396 --> 47:38.398
Oh, right. Did you search what I asked?

47:38.481 --> 47:40.275
I told you, I told you.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.944
You clearly didn't see the fax.

47:44.153 --> 47:46.698
Those numbers your nephew sent over,

47:47.323 --> 47:49.951
it has to do with Chairman Myung,
as you predicted.

47:52.495 --> 47:53.580
Wait.

47:59.794 --> 48:01.629
YEOUIDO RAMBO
MARKET MANIPULATION?

48:01.713 --> 48:05.008
He's still the same:
filthy rich and greedy.

48:06.384 --> 48:10.388
Isn't Chairman Myung your mentor
in the money business?

48:12.432 --> 48:14.183
It was an ill-fated relationship.

48:16.060 --> 48:18.396
Let me ask you one more favor.

48:20.648 --> 48:22.108
Nice shot!

48:23.818 --> 48:26.487
Those balls are flying high today. Killer!

48:28.865 --> 48:31.034
This isn't going to be a problem, Father?

48:31.117 --> 48:33.119
MYUNG IN-JU
CHAIRMAN OF MYUNGIN HOLDINGS

48:33.202 --> 48:35.663
Of course not. That kid knows nothing.

48:36.289 --> 48:38.541
I have strong support from you.

48:38.625 --> 48:40.668
I'll take care of my business.

48:40.752 --> 48:43.171
Please be sure to tie up any loose ends
on your end.

48:44.839 --> 48:47.467
Why are you whining? Don't worry.

48:48.009 --> 48:49.719
I'm clean.

48:51.346 --> 48:54.098
You say you're clean,
but it's happening again.

48:59.437 --> 49:01.689
Your father's properties are fine, right?

49:04.025 --> 49:06.819
A truck driver to a property owner, huh?

49:08.196 --> 49:09.697
He's getting pretty fat.

49:11.115 --> 49:12.408
He needs to exercise.

49:18.373 --> 49:21.501
Don't worry about Yeouido Rambo.

49:21.584 --> 49:24.754
I have a strong lock on his lips.

49:30.385 --> 49:31.844
I'm clean.

49:32.470 --> 49:35.014
I have no problems. You understand?

49:37.642 --> 49:38.726
Yes.

49:39.769 --> 49:41.479
You should exercise too.

49:42.271 --> 49:46.150
I put some new clubs in your car trunk.
Use them for work when you need to.

50:00.748 --> 50:04.669
Rambo, that idiotic bastard.
How did the prosecution get that file?

50:04.752 --> 50:06.045
KIM SEONG-TAE
DIRECTOR, GMI BANK

50:06.129 --> 50:08.256
The night he got his DUI,
he lost his bag at the club.

50:08.339 --> 50:11.300
-Club?
-I sent my men over there to check.

50:12.510 --> 50:14.137
That little shit.

50:15.346 --> 50:17.014
Something smells fishy.

50:31.529 --> 50:32.655
You found it?

50:32.739 --> 50:34.657
-Yes, sir.
-Play it.

51:09.942 --> 51:10.943
Stop.

51:12.862 --> 51:14.489
Zoom in.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.787
This is the girl who stole the files
and turned him in?

51:21.496 --> 51:22.663
She's cute.

51:23.998 --> 51:27.668
Lee Chang-min,
known as Yeouido Rambo, is being arrested

51:27.752 --> 51:30.254
on allegations
of stock-price manipulation.

51:30.338 --> 51:32.548
Prosecutor in charge Jang Tae-chun

51:33.257 --> 51:35.343
said he will be giving a brief

51:35.426 --> 51:38.679
about what exactly took place.

51:45.061 --> 51:47.230
Mr. Nam. Welcome.

51:48.481 --> 51:51.776
Well, you brought quite a pile,
as a seasoned investigator should.

51:52.318 --> 51:54.403
-Here, let me.
-Forget it. Just forget it.

51:54.987 --> 51:57.323
I was an old-timer working in peace.

51:57.406 --> 52:00.117
Why am I called to your office
all of a sudden?

52:00.201 --> 52:04.330
Of course, I asked my chief
for special permission.

52:04.413 --> 52:06.332
I think you misunderstand.

52:06.415 --> 52:09.961
I hate difficult cases.
That's why I quit Special Investigations.

52:11.212 --> 52:12.839
Let me. Here.

52:12.922 --> 52:14.090
Wait, Mr. Jang.

52:18.177 --> 52:19.428
This desk is yours.

52:20.471 --> 52:22.723
It's a nice spot.

52:23.266 --> 52:24.600
Most importantly,

52:25.726 --> 52:27.353
you'll see my face clearly.

52:32.108 --> 52:36.696
You also wanted to investigate
Yeouido Rambo, right?

52:39.490 --> 52:42.535
All kinds of names come out
if you dig into such cases.

52:42.618 --> 52:45.037
You're a newbie prosecutor.
You think you can handle it?

52:45.121 --> 52:46.122
Mr. Nam,

52:47.415 --> 52:51.252
my mom gave birth to me at 19
and raised me by herself.

52:51.335 --> 52:55.506
She was a maid, a server.
She did whatever she could to raise me.

52:56.424 --> 52:58.801
My mom's wish is to see me on the news.

52:59.844 --> 53:01.137
I ask of you…

53:03.431 --> 53:04.974
please help me.

53:17.612 --> 53:19.614
You're a mama's boy, huh?

53:20.531 --> 53:23.117
The story of a single mom
working as a maid…

53:23.200 --> 53:24.660
I'm not working nights.

53:24.744 --> 53:25.786
…always works.

53:25.870 --> 53:28.331
I promised my wife
when I quit Special Investigations.

53:29.540 --> 53:32.418
Until you retire,
I will guarantee your clock-out time.

53:33.169 --> 53:35.630
If you need, you can get maternity leave.

53:38.633 --> 53:40.801
The warrants have already been approved.

53:41.427 --> 53:44.805
Beauty Sparkle and GMI Bank,
let's turn them inside and out--

53:44.889 --> 53:46.891
You got the warrant approved like this?

53:47.808 --> 53:49.560
I got this done in the morning.

53:50.478 --> 53:53.147
Do you not know who the CEO of GMI is?

53:54.732 --> 53:56.025
Who is it?

53:57.443 --> 54:02.073
Oh Chang-hyeon, a former district attorney
from Special Investigations.

54:02.156 --> 54:03.324
I also worked for him.

54:08.746 --> 54:12.750
OH CHANG-HYEON, CEO OF GMI BANK
FORMER SEOUL DISTRICT ATTORNEY

54:25.513 --> 54:26.722
So, Chief Park.

54:27.431 --> 54:31.143
About your investigation
into our GMI Bank…

54:32.728 --> 54:35.856
We're only investigating by the rules.

54:38.609 --> 54:41.654
Is that why you're meeting the subject
of your investigation?

54:44.949 --> 54:46.909
Well, you're my senior.

54:46.993 --> 54:49.829
If this makes you uncomfortable,
I'll leave the table.

54:52.206 --> 54:54.917
Where I am is where you'll be.

54:56.836 --> 54:58.170
Don't work too hard.

55:00.214 --> 55:02.383
You can eat the food from the bowl…

55:04.552 --> 55:06.554
but don't break the bowl.

55:12.309 --> 55:13.310
Hey.

55:14.603 --> 55:15.980
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Oh.

55:19.191 --> 55:21.485
-We just got here.
-Yes, sir.

55:21.569 --> 55:23.029
I was at the Supreme Office.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.282
Jeong-su, been a while.

55:27.033 --> 55:29.577
Why the Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

55:29.660 --> 55:33.581
The deputy office post at the Pusan office
will become vacant soon.

55:33.664 --> 55:35.124
We were talking about that.

55:37.043 --> 55:39.712
Jeong-su, isn't Pusan your hometown?

55:41.505 --> 55:42.840
That's right.

55:42.923 --> 55:45.342
Wow. I can't believe I forgot, Mr. Oh.

56:00.816 --> 56:02.359
I understand your concern,

56:03.360 --> 56:06.572
but this investigation began
with Chief Park's approval.

56:09.617 --> 56:14.538
We have to get Chairman Myung
to strike Chief Hwang, so to speak.

56:15.873 --> 56:18.125
What are you whispering for?

56:18.209 --> 56:20.628
People have been saying that
for eons already.

56:26.717 --> 56:30.763
Do you really think Chief Park's goal
is to go after Chief Hwang?

56:32.556 --> 56:33.974
What do you mean?

56:34.058 --> 56:37.228
A prosecutor's true power isn't showcased

56:37.311 --> 56:40.481
when they exercise the power to prosecute,
but when they choose not to.

56:41.899 --> 56:46.487
They can't cover it up like old times,
so they're choosing a middle ground.

56:48.072 --> 56:49.490
A middle ground?

56:56.831 --> 56:58.332
It's Chief Park, isn't it?

57:02.920 --> 57:06.173
Good job. Search and seize Sparkle
and table the investigation.

57:06.257 --> 57:08.509
How come you're only approving half of it?

57:09.135 --> 57:11.470
We have to hit GMI Bank
to get Chairman Myung--

57:11.554 --> 57:15.015
You just need to dig into Sparkle.
It'll get you enough to indict Rambo.

57:15.099 --> 57:17.810
Just get something in writing
for GMI Bank and drop it.

57:18.686 --> 57:20.855
Is this because GMI's CEO
is your predecessor?

57:22.773 --> 57:25.192
I need to show him some manners, don't I?

57:26.152 --> 57:29.113
You did well with the investigation.
You got to be on TV.

57:29.196 --> 57:31.699
Your work evaluation deserves
an A-plus-plus.

57:31.782 --> 57:34.785
When promotion season comes around,
you'll hear good news.

57:34.869 --> 57:37.663
So, do I get to go
to Special Investigations?

57:39.915 --> 57:41.667
Damn it, kid.

57:41.750 --> 57:44.920
Your dreams are swelling
now that you got a taste for the cameras?

57:47.715 --> 57:51.677
You went to Gwangjin University, right?
I'll get you a position over there.

57:52.303 --> 57:56.390
Why would you want to be a tail?
Lay your foundation at your turf.

57:57.057 --> 57:59.560
Even rice-farming companies
are competitive in Seoul.

57:59.643 --> 58:02.229
-Chief--
-Do you have an appointment tonight?

58:03.480 --> 58:05.649
No. Not really.

58:05.733 --> 58:07.026
Good.

58:07.109 --> 58:10.196
Choi and I need to attend
our professor's 60th.

58:10.279 --> 58:12.907
-You stay overnight tonight.
-What?

58:12.990 --> 58:15.951
Rambo! Good work today. Hey.

58:21.540 --> 58:23.542
Order something expensive tonight.

58:43.229 --> 58:46.190
Among judges, prosecutors and lawyers,

58:46.774 --> 58:51.028
I heard prosecution is the only place
you can make it big with skill alone

58:51.111 --> 58:53.948
regardless of your background,
and that's why I chose it.

58:54.031 --> 58:55.449
You're the prosecutor?

58:55.532 --> 58:57.868
-Yes.
-It's a high-school senior.

58:57.952 --> 59:01.455
I gather from her suicide note
she took her life because of her grades.

59:16.762 --> 59:18.013
Confirmed.

59:18.097 --> 59:20.474
Oh, okay. Please sign here.

59:21.642 --> 59:24.979
Prosecutors are all about skills?
I don't think so.

59:25.062 --> 59:29.024
Could it be that even if I try hard,
what's not meant to be won't be?

59:51.422 --> 59:53.173
Chief Park may be satisfied,

59:54.550 --> 59:56.218
but I'm still hungry for more.

59:57.303 --> 59:59.388
GMI Bank isn't on the warrant.

59:59.930 --> 1:00:02.266
CEO Oh is getting off
with a written investigation.

1:00:02.349 --> 1:00:04.476
Prosecution is as dirty as ever.

1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:07.563
The case might just wrap up like this.

1:00:11.108 --> 1:00:13.694
After serving as a district attorney
in Seoul,

1:00:13.777 --> 1:00:16.113
he ran for the assembly
to serve his nation again.

1:00:16.196 --> 1:00:19.616
After two unsuccessful campaigns,
he took on a new challenge

1:00:19.700 --> 1:00:23.329
and now leads the number one online
transaction solution company in Korea

1:00:23.412 --> 1:00:25.956
as the CEO of Goodmoney Investment Bank.

1:00:26.040 --> 1:00:30.169
As the CEO of a KOSDAQ-listed company,
he has begun a third chapter in his life.

1:00:30.252 --> 1:00:33.881
A prosecutor, a businessman,
and now an author,

1:00:33.964 --> 1:00:35.883
here is CEO Oh Chang-hyeon.

1:00:45.934 --> 1:00:48.604
The security footage has been handed over
to Chief Hwang.

1:00:48.687 --> 1:00:50.731
-Good job.
-The emcee is too honest.

1:00:50.814 --> 1:00:53.359
She mentioned my failed elections too.

1:00:55.903 --> 1:01:00.282
Failed elections lead to being elected.
Isn't that right?

1:01:01.492 --> 1:01:02.785
Yes!

1:01:03.577 --> 1:01:05.287
Oh, thank you.

1:01:05.371 --> 1:01:08.832
To all of you here today, I love you!

1:01:08.916 --> 1:01:10.376
We love you!

1:01:14.463 --> 1:01:19.301
Prosecute that con man Oh Chang-hyeon
for stock-market manipulation!

1:01:21.553 --> 1:01:22.638
What are you doing?

1:01:25.182 --> 1:01:26.517
Who's that crazy geezer?

1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:30.312
Investigate that man
to the fullest extent!

1:01:30.396 --> 1:01:32.481
-Security, get him out of here!
-That piece of…

1:01:32.564 --> 1:01:33.857
Get him out of here!

1:01:40.989 --> 1:01:42.449
Get him! Fire!

1:01:43.742 --> 1:01:45.744
Who is that crazy fool?

1:01:50.207 --> 1:01:52.126
MAN ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
AT BOOK CONCERT

1:01:53.627 --> 1:01:55.462
Hey, what happened to that man?

1:01:55.546 --> 1:01:57.798
His whole body is burned, but he'll live.

1:01:57.881 --> 1:01:59.466
Damn it.

1:02:00.092 --> 1:02:02.928
I'll approve the previous warrant.
Search and seize GMI Bank.

1:02:03.011 --> 1:02:04.138
What?

1:02:04.221 --> 1:02:08.517
Kid, the world knows about the case now.

1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:11.812
Let them see the search-and-seize.
Make it a photo op for you.

1:02:11.895 --> 1:02:13.981
Take a huge box that says "prosecution."

1:02:14.064 --> 1:02:15.065
Okay.

1:02:16.817 --> 1:02:18.902
Damn it.

1:02:20.904 --> 1:02:22.865
-There they are!
-Wait!

1:02:25.576 --> 1:02:26.702
GMI BANK

1:02:30.664 --> 1:02:33.250
-Look over here!
-Look over here!

1:02:36.545 --> 1:02:38.922
Will CEO Oh of GMI Bank get
his summons today?

1:02:39.006 --> 1:02:41.758
Did you cut him some slack
because he's a former prosecutor?

1:02:41.842 --> 1:02:43.677
I can't speak about
an ongoing investigation.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:47.014
However, if there are suspicions,

1:02:47.097 --> 1:02:50.601
the prosecution will consider
nothing sacred and will not hesitate.

1:02:55.105 --> 1:02:56.940
Do we have anything useful?

1:02:57.024 --> 1:02:58.525
We already lost on timing.

1:02:58.609 --> 1:03:00.736
Just taking empty boxes
will be meaningful.

1:03:00.819 --> 1:03:02.779
CEO Oh is now subject to investigation.

1:03:09.244 --> 1:03:12.331
GMI Bank,
which your nephew is investigating,

1:03:12.414 --> 1:03:15.542
used to be called Bluenet,
led by CEO Yoon Hye-rin.

1:03:17.169 --> 1:03:19.546
I think Yoon was
one of Chairman Myung's victims.

1:03:21.340 --> 1:03:23.175
More details to come.

1:03:23.258 --> 1:03:25.761
YOON HYE-RIN, 1957-2010

1:03:33.602 --> 1:03:36.063
MINISTER SON,
BRIBERY ALLEGATIONS

1:03:36.146 --> 1:03:37.773
LISTED COMPANY CEO ARRESTED

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:42.819
BLUENET CEO YOON DRIVES CAR
OFF CLIFF… LIKELY A SUICIDE

1:03:49.576 --> 1:03:51.662
Mrs. Yoon died.

1:03:51.745 --> 1:03:53.205
BLUENET CEO ACCIDENT FOOTAGE

1:04:09.721 --> 1:04:11.014
Miss Park Joon-gyeong?

1:04:13.267 --> 1:04:15.227
We're from Seoul Prosecution.

1:04:15.894 --> 1:04:18.564
We're investigating something.
Will you come with us?

1:04:37.874 --> 1:04:42.421
The anonymous tip to Tae-chun
was definitely Joon-gyeong's doing.

1:05:15.245 --> 1:05:17.456
CHINGGIS KHAAN
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

1:05:43.190 --> 1:05:45.275
Joon-gyeong's anonymous tip to Tae-chun…

1:05:45.359 --> 1:05:47.027
Welcome aboard, sir.

1:05:47.110 --> 1:05:48.737
…is a message to me.

1:05:57.871 --> 1:05:59.122
"Come home…

1:06:01.541 --> 1:06:03.043
and let's fight this together."

1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:44.501
The sword's already drawn,
so let's fight until the end.

1:06:44.584 --> 1:06:47.212
I might have, if you fought with money.

1:06:47.796 --> 1:06:49.548
But you fight using real knives.

1:06:49.631 --> 1:06:51.550
Article 44 of the Military Court Act.

1:06:51.633 --> 1:06:54.261
"The power to investigate a soldier
belongs to the army."

1:06:54.344 --> 1:06:55.345
Let's go.

1:06:56.847 --> 1:06:59.391
-What do we do?
-With Hwang Gi-seok in his family,

1:06:59.474 --> 1:07:03.019
Myung is no longer just a loan shark.

1:07:03.103 --> 1:07:04.229
You're killing the kid.

1:07:04.312 --> 1:07:05.814
Sir.

1:07:05.897 --> 1:07:07.983
You want to manipulate the stock price?

1:07:08.066 --> 1:07:11.236
You can't win by playing fair
in this dirty playing field.

1:07:11.862 --> 1:07:13.321
You cannot beat Chairman Myung

1:07:14.781 --> 1:07:16.450
with law and principles.
