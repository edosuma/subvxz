00:20.375 --> 00:21.667
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:22.333 --> 00:26.875
<i>a professional fight,</i>
<i>composed of six three-minute rounds,</i>

00:26.958 --> 00:29.208
<i>in the super middleweight division.</i>

00:29.792 --> 00:34.000
<i>The first of tonight's boxers is assigned</i>
<i>to the red corner.</i>

00:34.083 --> 00:35.583
<i>His record:</i>

00:35.792 --> 00:37.500
48 matches,

00:37.958 --> 00:39.333
13 wins,

00:39.417 --> 00:41.083
three draws,

00:41.167 --> 00:42.542
32 losses.

00:42.625 --> 00:43.708
Let's hear it

00:43.792 --> 00:46.833
for Steve

00:46.917 --> 00:49.667
Landry!

01:08.500 --> 01:11.083
In the red corner,

01:11.667 --> 01:15.083
Steve Landry!

01:37.958 --> 01:42.750
Our evening continues
with a second bout of educational boxing.

01:45.083 --> 01:47.208
Coaches, prepare your fighters.

01:47.292 --> 01:48.208
Thank you.

03:18.125 --> 03:19.875
Evening, you have a ticket?

03:19.958 --> 03:21.208
No, it's inside.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.458
Well, I need to see a ticket.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.125
-I was in the ring.
-A badge?

03:27.208 --> 03:29.208
I was in the ring. My stuff's inside.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.875
-Do you have a badge?
-It's inside.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.917
-I need it.
-I'll get it.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.667
You can't go in without it.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.375
I just came out. Seriously.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.625
How should I know? I didn't see you.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.042
-I need your badge.
-Hocine!

03:43.125 --> 03:44.167
No can do.

03:45.083 --> 03:48.958
-Calling Hocine makes no difference.
-Makes no difference? What the...

03:50.083 --> 03:52.625
-They won't let me in.
-Excuse me, boys.

03:52.708 --> 03:54.292
I was in the ring.

03:54.375 --> 03:55.500
How should I know?

03:55.583 --> 03:57.000
Can't you tell he boxed?

03:57.083 --> 03:59.750
I don't know, maybe he fell.
No badge, no entry.

03:59.833 --> 04:03.667
-You said no one without a badge.
-He boxed, you moron. Move.

05:42.417 --> 05:43.417
Did you win?

05:46.708 --> 05:47.542
Almost.

05:57.375 --> 05:58.583
Does that hurt?

05:58.667 --> 05:59.792
Not at all.

06:01.042 --> 06:02.292
It's a pleasure.

06:09.333 --> 06:11.583
-Can I come next time, please?
-No.

06:11.667 --> 06:12.625
Why not?

06:12.708 --> 06:15.083
-Because...
-Can I? Please...

06:15.167 --> 06:16.958
-I said, no.
-Please.

06:17.042 --> 06:19.250
-No.
-Why not? Please.

06:19.333 --> 06:20.833
Because you can't.

06:20.917 --> 06:21.833
Why not?

06:22.500 --> 06:23.750
Because you can't!

06:23.833 --> 06:25.042
Why?

06:34.500 --> 06:35.375
Wait.

06:52.958 --> 06:53.917
Pass the cherries.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.292
WEIGHT

07:06.750 --> 07:08.042
Pass me the other bag.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.042
Here.

07:26.625 --> 07:27.458
All set?

07:55.708 --> 07:57.542
We're not quite finished.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.500
No, come in.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.917
Wait in the garden, if you like.

08:04.625 --> 08:05.750
Go ahead.

08:05.958 --> 08:08.250
-You're sure you don't mind?
-Not at all.

08:15.833 --> 08:17.083
Oscar, be careful.

08:35.875 --> 08:38.917
Start over. From here to there.

08:40.375 --> 08:41.542
I'll be right back.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.833
-She plays well, right?
-She does.

08:59.917 --> 09:00.875
With both hands?

09:01.250 --> 09:03.542
Yes, of course, that's the very least.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.125
Mr. Landry, would you mind
paying the lessons you owe me?

09:08.208 --> 09:11.458
School vacation is soon,
I'd rather we settled up.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.875
Sorry, I forgot. How much do I owe you?

09:13.958 --> 09:17.792
The last three lessons,
plus this one, makes 160.

09:21.250 --> 09:24.000
What can I do to help her progress?

09:24.417 --> 09:25.292
You see?

09:26.583 --> 09:29.167
There aren't that many options.

09:29.250 --> 09:32.208
Getting to the next level requires
daily practice.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.167
It takes a piano?

09:35.167 --> 09:36.750
Yes, that would be...

09:36.833 --> 09:39.042
Yes, it takes a piano.

09:40.333 --> 09:41.583
Pianos are expensive.

09:41.917 --> 09:46.250
It depends. But it is an investment,
that's for certain.

09:48.542 --> 09:50.667
I only have 70 euros on me.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.500
I'll bring the rest...

09:53.542 --> 09:55.708
-after vacation?
-Yeah, that's fine.

09:57.417 --> 09:58.875
Do you think she's got it?

09:59.833 --> 10:00.708
Got what?

10:01.167 --> 10:04.750
In boxing, when a boxer's got it...

10:05.583 --> 10:06.833
he's got it.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.708
You know...

10:10.625 --> 10:13.083
playing the piano isn't like boxing.

10:13.167 --> 10:14.167
Of course not.

10:17.708 --> 10:18.875
Oscar, let's go.

10:20.958 --> 10:21.917
See you!

10:29.042 --> 10:30.292
What did she say?

10:30.875 --> 10:32.208
That you're on fire.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.167
Dad, it's over.

10:40.875 --> 10:41.833
Take another.

10:43.292 --> 10:45.042
Take another spin.

10:54.792 --> 10:55.625
Hey.

10:56.417 --> 10:57.500
Can I have a drag?

10:58.708 --> 11:00.250
-Got the groceries?
-Yeah.

11:02.042 --> 11:04.292
-Did you remember the milk?
-Of course.

11:04.917 --> 11:06.042
Did piano go well?

11:06.833 --> 11:07.667
Sure did.

11:08.917 --> 11:10.625
She's talented.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.958
-Really?
-She loves it. You should see her glow.

11:14.042 --> 11:15.708
-Really?
-It's beautiful to watch.

11:16.583 --> 11:17.417
Really.

11:18.208 --> 11:19.333
That's great.

11:19.417 --> 11:22.458
Her teacher told me, she's got it.

11:23.458 --> 11:24.375
Got it?

11:24.458 --> 11:25.917
Got it, like...

11:26.375 --> 11:28.458
-Like a gift.
-Are you serious?

11:30.333 --> 11:31.833
Where'd she get it from?

11:36.875 --> 11:39.708
For her to progress,
we have to buy a piano.

11:39.792 --> 11:41.083
-A piano?
-Yeah.

11:42.167 --> 11:45.250
-You know how much they cost?
-Some are cheap.

11:45.333 --> 11:47.417
Even so, we're broke.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.542
That's no reason to live like bums
and ignore her dream.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.083
You make me laugh.

11:52.583 --> 11:54.625
You know we have lots of bills.

11:55.333 --> 11:59.250
-Yeah. Medical insurance, for starters.
-Who cares about insurance?

11:59.333 --> 12:01.708
If they get sick, what do we do?

12:01.792 --> 12:04.750
-They don't get sick.
-Don't jinx us.

12:05.958 --> 12:10.708
With a piano, she could live her dream
and go to school in Paris.

12:10.792 --> 12:12.167
It's what she wants.

12:12.250 --> 12:15.042
-She has to work every day.
-Yeah, I'm with you.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.042
And I'm still boxing. I can pay.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.833
-You know how many fights you've had?
-Forty-five?

12:21.083 --> 12:22.125
Forty-nine.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.750
You always said you'd stop at 50.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.708
Then what do we do?

12:31.000 --> 12:31.833
Coming.

12:32.417 --> 12:33.542
I have to get back.

12:34.292 --> 12:36.500
-I don't want you to end up...
-What?

12:37.417 --> 12:39.000
Like they all do.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.083
Later.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.125
<i>Hello, Hocine?</i>

12:56.625 --> 12:57.708
<i>It's Steve.</i>

12:58.583 --> 12:59.500
<i>How's it going?</i>

13:00.875 --> 13:03.583
<i>I saw you were organizing an event soon.</i>

13:04.375 --> 13:07.000
I was wondering if you needed
a middleweight.

13:09.208 --> 13:10.125
Nothing?

13:11.917 --> 13:13.917
If someone withdraws, let me know.

13:14.875 --> 13:16.375
Okay, talk to you soon.

13:17.417 --> 13:20.292
<i>Right now I weigh 165. But I can bulk up.</i>

13:23.375 --> 13:24.250
You're sure?

13:26.917 --> 13:27.750
Thanks.

13:28.958 --> 13:32.000
I'm looking for a fight.
Do you have anything?

13:34.667 --> 13:35.500
Really?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.542
See you soon maybe, then?

13:43.042 --> 13:43.875
Bye.

13:56.875 --> 13:57.708
That's it!

14:01.500 --> 14:02.333
Very good.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.833
Counter once, same arm.

14:06.875 --> 14:07.792
Change.

14:12.000 --> 14:12.833
Him?

14:14.083 --> 14:17.625
-He's a real middleweight.
-Too tall.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.917
-Is he a light heavyweight?
-He is.

14:26.625 --> 14:27.458
Too tall.

14:28.292 --> 14:30.083
It's down to them.

14:30.917 --> 14:33.125
How about the white kid?

14:38.542 --> 14:39.625
Can I talk to him?

14:40.917 --> 14:41.750
Jérémy?

14:43.125 --> 14:44.000
Over here.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.458
-What's your record?
-Ten fights.

14:48.542 --> 14:49.750
-How many?
-Ten.

14:50.708 --> 14:51.917
-Wins?
-Nine.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.333
You weigh what, 163, 165?

14:55.042 --> 14:56.083
One sixty-three.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.542
-Are you up to sparring with M'Bareck?
-You bet! I'd love to.

15:02.833 --> 15:03.833
Thank you, sir.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.625
-José has your number?
-He does.

15:07.208 --> 15:10.167
No promises, I'll call you.
Get back to work.

15:11.292 --> 15:12.125
Good deal.

15:17.958 --> 15:18.917
Yeah, he'll do.

15:23.750 --> 15:24.583
Hands up.

15:30.583 --> 15:31.958
When you throw a jab...

15:33.375 --> 15:34.250
Wait.

15:34.625 --> 15:35.542
Jab again.

15:38.792 --> 15:39.625
Jérémy.

15:40.292 --> 15:41.375
Tell me something.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.375
Who is that guy?

15:43.458 --> 15:46.500
-A coach looking for sparring partners.
-You talked?

15:47.167 --> 15:48.417
I'm interested.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.417
In sparring?

15:50.333 --> 15:53.042
-Domingo, it's for Tarek M'Bareck.
-Is that so?

15:54.958 --> 15:56.500
-You know who he is?
-Sure.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.833
From TV, but do you know how he punches?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.083
No, you don't know.

16:01.708 --> 16:02.833
-I'll learn.
-You won't.

16:02.917 --> 16:05.875
You'll take hits
and get treated like a dog.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.167
Excuse me.

16:37.958 --> 16:40.667
You're looking for sparring partners
for Tarek M'Bareck?

16:42.125 --> 16:43.250
Are you a lefty?

16:43.333 --> 16:44.250
No.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.458
-Forget it.
-I can fake a southpaw.

16:46.542 --> 16:49.417
-You're too old. Sorry.
-I'm experienced.

16:51.167 --> 16:52.292
What's your record?

16:52.833 --> 16:56.083
Forty-nine fights:
thirteen, three, thirty-three losses.

16:58.042 --> 16:59.292
Take care, my friend.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.583
-Who is he up against?
-Marvin Mathis.

17:01.667 --> 17:02.583
I know him.

17:02.667 --> 17:05.375
-We all do.
-I fought him eight years ago.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.958
He was fresh out of amateur.

17:09.375 --> 17:11.000
-Where?
-Right here.

17:11.792 --> 17:13.083
-Did you win?
-Of course not.

17:13.167 --> 17:15.458
But I know how he fights, how he punches.

17:17.042 --> 17:18.667
What kind of partner are you after?

17:21.458 --> 17:23.125
What are you, 163, 165?

17:23.208 --> 17:25.042
Less, but I can bulk up.

17:26.417 --> 17:29.750
-You'll have to take hits and suck it up.
-That's me.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.875
-José has your number?
-Yeah.

17:37.333 --> 17:38.875
No promises, I'll call you.

17:55.958 --> 17:57.125
Want a drink?

17:58.208 --> 17:59.542
-A Coke.
-A Coke?

17:59.625 --> 18:00.708
Little chicken!

18:00.792 --> 18:04.458
He's as cute as a little chicken.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.625
A little fried chicken.

18:06.708 --> 18:08.083
Something to drink?

18:09.417 --> 18:11.208
She said, my little shrimp!

18:11.292 --> 18:12.417
What do you want?

18:13.583 --> 18:16.375
-Whatever you like.
-A Coke sounds good.

18:16.458 --> 18:19.625
-And you, ma'am?
-A Martini.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.583
-White or red?
-White.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.375
Me, too. Two Martinis.

18:23.458 --> 18:24.500
White.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.375
So, what are we celebrating?

18:32.333 --> 18:34.167
I signed with a big name.

18:34.542 --> 18:36.417
-Really?
-And it pays well.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.292
You'll be getting your piano.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.083
My piano? Piano!

18:40.167 --> 18:42.000
-Are you happy?
-Awesome!

18:42.083 --> 18:45.583
-And the insurance.
-Seriously? Both at the same time?

18:45.875 --> 18:46.708
Yup.

18:48.542 --> 18:50.917
-That's incredible, Steve.
-It's awesome.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.417
-Happy?
-My own piano!

18:52.500 --> 18:55.208
-To practice every day.
-My own piano at home?

18:55.292 --> 18:56.375
That's incredible.

18:56.458 --> 18:57.542
Are you happy too?

18:58.292 --> 18:59.667
You get your insurance.

19:01.208 --> 19:04.417
You can get into trouble,
break all your arms and legs.

19:06.625 --> 19:07.875
What is it, a fight?

19:07.958 --> 19:11.125
Not a fight,
I'll be training Tarek M'Bareck.

19:11.208 --> 19:14.458
He's a champion...
You saw him on YouTube.

19:14.542 --> 19:18.250
-Yeah, the one who's dating Ambre.
-That's it.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.625
The singer.

19:19.708 --> 19:22.917
-Okay, I see.
-I showed you the commercial.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.125
It's great news.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.042
It's with him?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.458
-You're training him?
-Yeah.

19:32.167 --> 19:35.083
-You'll be his sparring partner?
-Yeah, kind of.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.458
Do I look stupid?

19:38.167 --> 19:39.750
No, you don't look stupid.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.292
You swore, you'd never do that.

19:43.333 --> 19:44.542
It's very well paid.

19:44.750 --> 19:45.875
I don't care.

19:45.958 --> 19:49.667
You've always said,
it's more dangerous than fighting.

19:51.042 --> 19:52.625
What's a sparring partner?

19:53.167 --> 19:57.083
A sparring partner, sweetie,
is when a champion like Tarek

19:57.167 --> 19:59.000
hires boxers like your dad

19:59.083 --> 20:01.875
to beat the crap out of them... big-time.

20:01.958 --> 20:04.292
-Don't exaggerate.
-Isn't that right?

20:04.375 --> 20:06.292
The champion prepares his fight...

20:07.000 --> 20:09.542
and the others end up in a wheelchair.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.917
-Is that true?
-No.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.417
You're scaring her for nothing.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.333
-Isn't that right?
-No, it's not.

20:14.417 --> 20:16.042
You're exaggerating.

20:16.125 --> 20:17.333
Is that true, Dad?

20:17.708 --> 20:19.292
Of course not.

20:19.375 --> 20:20.958
Then what did you tell me?

20:21.042 --> 20:22.375
Don't argue.

20:22.458 --> 20:27.958
Sparring is when a boxer needs to train,
you train with him. It's not so...

20:28.042 --> 20:29.875
Stop it, Steve. Stop.

20:32.917 --> 20:35.208
If you end up like a vegetable,

20:35.292 --> 20:37.375
don't count on me to be your nurse.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.667
I won't end up like a vegetable.

20:40.292 --> 20:41.917
Why are you saying that?

20:47.333 --> 20:49.167
I won't end up like a vegetable.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.542
Pass me the...

20:53.500 --> 20:55.917
Your mother ticks me off.
She really does.

22:48.625 --> 22:49.458
Okay.

22:50.083 --> 22:52.500
-Okay, sir. Do you know where it is?
-No.

22:52.583 --> 22:54.333
Through the casino, on the left.

22:54.417 --> 22:56.125
-You'll see the theater.
-Thank you.

23:20.375 --> 23:21.708
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

23:26.292 --> 23:27.750
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.167
Excuse me?

24:37.292 --> 24:39.167
-Hi.
-How can I help you?

24:39.250 --> 24:41.333
-I'm here for the sparring.
-Great.

24:41.417 --> 24:42.750
-Your name?
-Steve.

24:42.833 --> 24:46.292
Steve, down the stairs.
I'll show you the changing room.

24:46.375 --> 24:47.208
Okay.

25:08.167 --> 25:11.125
Malik, Omar's assistant.
The changing room's this way.

25:13.708 --> 25:16.958
It's back there. Get ready,
I'll meet you by the ring.

25:17.042 --> 25:17.875
Thanks.

25:22.583 --> 25:23.875
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:24.750 --> 25:25.583
-Steve.
-Ali.

25:25.667 --> 25:26.667
Nice to meet you.

25:28.208 --> 25:29.125
Get dressed.

25:40.083 --> 25:41.792
-Hey, guys.
-How's it going?

25:43.625 --> 25:44.458
Hi.

25:44.875 --> 25:45.792
All settled in?

25:46.417 --> 25:47.417
Like the place?

25:47.500 --> 25:48.333
Terrific.

25:48.417 --> 25:51.417
-There's a Jacuzzi, too.
-We saw. Terrific.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.333
Thank you. It's great.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.208
Your face looks familiar.

25:58.458 --> 26:00.500
Amateur champion, France, 2002.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.083
-No?
-No.

26:04.167 --> 26:05.292
That's not it?

26:05.375 --> 26:07.667
I have 30 some fights as a pro.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.375
Twenty-two wins, one draw.

26:09.458 --> 26:13.417
Seven losses. But out of those seven,
I was robbed four times.

26:13.750 --> 26:14.750
Oh, yeah?

26:15.667 --> 26:17.458
I suppose you've been robbed, too?

26:18.375 --> 26:19.375
-Me?
-Yeah.

26:19.458 --> 26:21.250
-I don't get robbed.
-Is that so?

26:21.333 --> 26:23.708
No. I knock out, or I get knocked out.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.083
You'll have to show me later.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.375
Excuse me, how old are you?

26:34.083 --> 26:34.917
Forty-five.

26:36.292 --> 26:37.417
What's your record?

26:39.125 --> 26:40.542
Forty-nine matches,

26:40.625 --> 26:43.750
thirteen wins, three draws,
thirty-three losses.

26:43.833 --> 26:45.125
Thirty-three losses?

26:50.083 --> 26:51.750
Who told you to come here?

26:52.917 --> 26:53.750
Your coach.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.125
Okay, then.

27:04.125 --> 27:05.375
See you in the ring.

27:06.625 --> 27:10.875
Count on us to train you hard.
You're gonna destroy Mathis.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.125
Piece of cake, man!

27:17.417 --> 27:18.625
-Ali, right?
-Yeah.

27:18.833 --> 27:21.333
Stop right there.
Cake is for your kitchen.

27:21.417 --> 27:22.875
-It's an expression.
-Listen.

27:22.958 --> 27:24.750
Otherwise, you can pack up and go.

27:25.917 --> 27:30.125
No, I have to train. I don't have time.
Everyone has to be on the same page.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.708
-I didn't mean...
-I'm just saying.

27:33.792 --> 27:36.625
If it's that easy, pack up and go.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.958
-No, I'm sorry...
-I want things to be clear.

27:43.250 --> 27:45.375
Okay, guys? Are we on the same page?

27:46.792 --> 27:48.875
-Sorry, Tarek.
-No problem. See you shortly.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.917
Very good. Take control.

28:01.708 --> 28:03.000
-Good!
-That's it.

28:03.083 --> 28:05.667
Good. Take control. That's it.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.625
Take control. Bend your knees.

28:07.708 --> 28:08.875
Again.

28:08.958 --> 28:10.625
That's it. Counter.

28:10.708 --> 28:12.167
That's it! Counter.

28:12.708 --> 28:13.792
Take control.

28:13.875 --> 28:17.208
That's what you're not doing.
Front arm. Control.

28:17.875 --> 28:19.083
Prepare, prepare.

28:21.250 --> 28:22.542
Prepare your attacks.

28:23.417 --> 28:26.042
Give him a harder time, please. Come on.

28:29.958 --> 28:30.792
Time!

28:32.083 --> 28:33.875
Come on, move in!

28:35.958 --> 28:38.542
Move in more! Give him a hard time.

28:39.917 --> 28:42.750
-Malik, warm up number three for me.
-Okay.

29:00.625 --> 29:01.625
Time!

29:01.708 --> 29:03.292
Good. That's it. Thanks, Ali.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.083
Watch your jaw, raise your hands.

29:07.417 --> 29:10.042
Agility. That's your thing.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.667
Dance, you're a dancer.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.083
Dance.

29:14.875 --> 29:16.833
-Let's go. Is he warmed up?
-Yeah.

29:17.792 --> 29:19.708
-Good to go.
-Give him headgear.

29:20.375 --> 29:21.208
Let's go.

29:21.833 --> 29:23.000
Quickly now.

29:23.083 --> 29:25.708
Go for his sides. Throw body punches.

29:25.792 --> 29:27.333
Then step back, okay?

29:28.125 --> 29:29.417
Come on, Ali. Quickly.

29:34.542 --> 29:35.375
Ready, guys?

29:36.625 --> 29:38.417
Okay, fight. Let's go.

29:50.125 --> 29:52.417
Work your legs, Tarek. What is that?

29:52.500 --> 29:54.167
That's it. Work your legs.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.875
Bend. That's it. It's all in the legs.

29:57.625 --> 29:59.958
It starts with the legs. You know that.

30:00.042 --> 30:01.333
Come on, now, feint.

30:03.333 --> 30:04.458
Change of rhythm.

30:05.417 --> 30:06.750
Steve, go to work!

30:07.375 --> 30:09.083
-Move around!
-Very good!

30:09.167 --> 30:10.583
Push those legs.

30:11.375 --> 30:12.583
Steve, guard up!

30:14.167 --> 30:15.875
-Move.
-More pressure.

30:16.583 --> 30:17.958
Push those legs.

30:18.042 --> 30:19.083
Jab, jab, jab!

30:19.167 --> 30:20.333
Poke, poke!

30:22.917 --> 30:24.292
Keep it up!

30:24.375 --> 30:25.208
More.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.292
-More. That's good.
-Move out.

30:27.375 --> 30:28.625
That's it. Prepare.

30:28.708 --> 30:29.708
Your guard.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.042
Hey, guys?

30:37.708 --> 30:38.750
Who is he?

30:38.833 --> 30:40.333
Steve, get in the game.

30:40.833 --> 30:41.833
He'll warm up.

30:41.917 --> 30:44.417
-Was he on sale?
-He'll warm up.

30:45.833 --> 30:48.375
Okay, get back to it.
I said, he'll warm up.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.750
Come on, let's go.

30:51.292 --> 30:52.250
Fight!

30:53.708 --> 30:55.500
-Hands up!
-That's illegal, champ!

30:55.583 --> 30:56.667
What the hell?

30:56.750 --> 30:57.875
Hands up!

31:01.583 --> 31:03.500
Hands up! Hands up!

31:04.250 --> 31:05.917
Keep your guard up, damn it!

31:08.250 --> 31:09.958
Work your legs. That's it.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.333
Good.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.750
Upper body, work your upper body.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.500
Yeah, work your slips.

31:20.792 --> 31:21.750
Pressure him.

31:21.833 --> 31:22.875
That's it. Jab!

31:29.125 --> 31:30.208
Good, that's it.

31:37.542 --> 31:38.792
Seriously?

31:39.375 --> 31:40.792
Who is this guy?

31:40.875 --> 31:43.542
-Come here.
-No! Who is he?

31:43.625 --> 31:44.542
Omar!

31:45.708 --> 31:46.667
What is this?

31:48.375 --> 31:50.292
I have a European championship.

31:51.250 --> 31:52.500
You call this sparring?

31:52.583 --> 31:54.958
-You want Mathis to win?
-He'll warm up.

31:55.042 --> 31:56.583
Steve, what's going on?

31:57.542 --> 31:58.542
David!

31:59.375 --> 32:01.083
Steve. Thank you.

32:01.167 --> 32:03.833
-He's fine.
-No, he's not fine at all. Thank you.

32:04.583 --> 32:05.625
Hurry up, David.

32:06.417 --> 32:07.583
Tarek's geared up.

32:09.125 --> 32:11.292
Apply more pressure, damn it!

32:11.375 --> 32:13.167
Don't hold back, pressure him.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.250
You're giving him too much...

32:16.333 --> 32:18.125
I don't care about him!

32:19.375 --> 32:20.333
Let's go, David.

32:21.917 --> 32:25.792
You're giving him too much space,
get in close.

32:50.292 --> 32:51.417
See you tomorrow.

32:57.833 --> 32:58.792
You did good.

33:01.375 --> 33:02.583
Nice pad.

33:06.042 --> 33:07.292
No need to come back.

33:07.875 --> 33:10.083
-I'll be fine tomorrow.
-We stop here.

33:10.167 --> 33:11.500
It won't work out.

33:12.417 --> 33:13.583
Does this cover it?

33:15.792 --> 33:17.875
-Ali, 3 p.m. tomorrow, please.
-Yup.

33:24.292 --> 33:25.917
-You gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

33:27.833 --> 33:29.625
-Can you drive?
-Yeah.

33:55.292 --> 33:56.125
Stop that.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.208
You missed!

33:58.000 --> 33:58.958
You missed!

34:02.333 --> 34:03.458
That's gross.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.667
Don't play with your food.

34:07.417 --> 34:09.125
Steve, cut it out.

34:10.042 --> 34:12.375
-Was Ambre there?
-Ambre?

34:14.667 --> 34:15.583
No, she wasn't.

34:16.625 --> 34:17.958
Do you think she'll come?

34:19.292 --> 34:20.833
I don't know. I guess.

34:22.750 --> 34:24.208
-You'll tell me?
-Eat.

34:24.292 --> 34:26.375
-I will.
-I am eating!

34:26.583 --> 34:28.375
My friends will totally freak.

34:30.250 --> 34:31.417
I'll take a selfish.

34:32.458 --> 34:33.625
A "selfie."

34:34.958 --> 34:36.333
-A selfie?
-Yes.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.000
Did you talk to him?

34:41.875 --> 34:42.708
Tarek?

34:43.292 --> 34:44.125
A little.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.000
Is he a show-off?

34:47.292 --> 34:48.125
No.

34:49.667 --> 34:50.875
No, he's rather...

34:53.417 --> 34:54.458
He's okay.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.500
What did you talk about?

34:57.583 --> 35:00.625
Nothing, boxing. What did you guys do?

35:01.917 --> 35:03.375
It was a normal day.

35:05.167 --> 35:07.292
-You don't seem very...
-Very what?

35:08.250 --> 35:09.250
Happy.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.458
I am happy.

35:11.083 --> 35:12.750
Is there dessert or something?

35:14.417 --> 35:17.417
There's yogurt in the fridge.
Nothing special.

35:19.333 --> 35:22.458
I'm sick of yogurt.
Get me a yogurt, will you?

36:32.250 --> 36:33.667
What are you doing here?

36:34.458 --> 36:35.750
Can I run with you?

36:36.042 --> 36:36.875
What?

36:37.417 --> 36:38.458
I need to talk to you.

38:06.125 --> 38:07.583
What's on your mind?

38:10.792 --> 38:14.333
This sparring is important for me...
and my family.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.083
Stop right there.
I'm not running a charity.

38:17.667 --> 38:21.083
I'm training for a European championship.
It's serious.

38:21.167 --> 38:24.042
It's my comeback.
I don't have time for sob stories.

38:24.333 --> 38:27.208
This fight is crucial,
I need only the best.

38:28.375 --> 38:30.667
I respect what you're saying.
I understand.

38:31.625 --> 38:34.500
What happened yesterday
is that I was nervous.

38:34.708 --> 38:36.375
It's my first sparring gig...

38:36.583 --> 38:37.667
Get off it, man.

38:39.375 --> 38:40.458
You weren't there.

38:42.000 --> 38:42.958
I was nervous.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.375
But you can count on me.
I can take it.

38:47.542 --> 38:50.333
Like a punching bag?
I've got plenty at the gym.

38:50.417 --> 38:51.625
I'm not a punching bag.

38:54.042 --> 38:54.958
I'm not.

38:58.083 --> 39:01.167
I'm a boxer. I take hits,
but I'm not a punching bag.

39:01.625 --> 39:04.750
-But I've got something you don't.
-Oh, yeah?

39:05.875 --> 39:07.292
I've been knocked out.

39:07.917 --> 39:09.417
I went back in the ring.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.750
And I can tell you...

39:12.292 --> 39:13.167
you're scared.

39:14.292 --> 39:15.708
You're not over your KO.

39:17.625 --> 39:20.417
You're afraid of taking hits,
and I'm telling you...

39:22.292 --> 39:24.333
you'll see, there's a before and an after.

39:25.792 --> 39:26.833
For all boxers.

39:28.708 --> 39:30.542
Before the KO and after the KO.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.958
You don't know who you're gonna be.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.042
Don't worry about me.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.500
I'm not worried.

39:41.250 --> 39:43.792
I'm telling you. I've been watching you.

39:44.708 --> 39:47.667
Go in the ring like that
and Mathis will destroy you.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.083
You'll dance a few rounds,
then he'll corner you.

39:51.167 --> 39:53.542
If you're scared, he'll break you in two.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.625
Believe me, if you aren't over it...

39:58.792 --> 40:00.833
you'll never be the champion
you used to be.

40:45.292 --> 40:47.333
Hey, kiddo. Off to your room.

40:48.250 --> 40:49.792
-It rained yesterday.
-So?

40:50.500 --> 40:52.958
You were supposed to bring in the laundry.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.500
Put your laundry in the garage, then...

40:56.583 --> 40:58.083
What? My laundry?

40:58.708 --> 41:00.167
You said, "my" laundry?

41:00.750 --> 41:02.292
It's "our" laundry.

41:02.375 --> 41:05.125
-Feel free to buy a dryer.
-Stop nagging.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.625
You think M'Bareck's wife nags him?

41:07.917 --> 41:10.917
You think M'Bareck and his wife
have dryer problems?

41:11.750 --> 41:13.375
Besides, you're not M'Bareck.

41:15.417 --> 41:16.417
I'm not M'Bareck?

41:20.292 --> 41:21.125
Like this!

41:22.125 --> 41:25.083
The other arm like that.
Try hitting the champ.

41:26.125 --> 41:27.125
Try hitting me.

41:28.667 --> 41:29.875
-You can't.
-Really?

41:30.292 --> 41:31.792
Wanna try me?

41:32.583 --> 41:33.750
You'll regret it.

41:39.083 --> 41:39.958
What?

41:42.208 --> 41:43.792
Nice one, look at you...

41:50.833 --> 41:52.792
Look what I did to Daddy.

41:53.292 --> 41:55.583
-That's your mother.
-Sorry. Show me.

41:55.667 --> 41:57.125
You're laughing, too?

41:57.208 --> 41:59.208
After my shower, you're toast.

42:09.333 --> 42:10.250
Excuse me, sir.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.125
I think I saw you
on Tarek M'Bareck's Facebook page.

42:14.208 --> 42:16.792
-You're his sparring partner, right?
-Yeah.

42:16.958 --> 42:18.625
I knew it. I recognized you.

42:18.708 --> 42:20.542
Mind if I take a picture?

42:21.167 --> 42:22.375
-Not at all.
-Thanks.

42:22.958 --> 42:23.792
Sorry.

42:27.083 --> 42:28.500
I wasn't sure...

42:33.583 --> 42:36.500
I wasn't sure at first,
but the black eye...

42:37.375 --> 42:38.500
Thanks.

42:39.542 --> 42:41.333
Cool. Not too tough?

42:41.417 --> 42:42.708
No, it's...

42:43.167 --> 42:45.583
-He hits hard, right?
-Yeah, well...

42:46.583 --> 42:48.708
And do you know Ambre?

42:49.125 --> 42:50.875
She came to training once.

42:50.958 --> 42:51.833
Insane.

42:52.292 --> 42:56.458
If I come to the public training,
you think I'll see her?

42:56.542 --> 42:57.958
Maybe, yeah.

42:58.042 --> 43:00.500
-You'll be there, too?
-I think so.

43:00.583 --> 43:01.458
Okay, okay.

43:01.542 --> 43:03.958
Thanks a lot, I'll come by next week.

43:04.625 --> 43:05.500
Thanks.

43:17.250 --> 43:18.458
We need milk too.

43:20.417 --> 43:21.792
Can I come to training?

43:22.458 --> 43:23.542
What training?

43:23.958 --> 43:24.792
That one.

43:24.875 --> 43:26.667
That one there? No.

43:27.417 --> 43:28.250
Why?

43:29.417 --> 43:33.083
I already told you.
You'll come to my last fight.

43:33.167 --> 43:34.042
When's that?

43:34.625 --> 43:36.250
I don't know. Soon.

43:39.375 --> 43:40.250
Soon.

44:37.917 --> 44:38.958
It's poetry.

44:40.292 --> 44:41.542
You call that poetry?

44:42.292 --> 44:43.667
You don't like poetry?

44:43.917 --> 44:45.042
That's not poetry.

44:45.125 --> 44:47.625
"We all have a ship in our hearts."
It's beautiful.

44:47.708 --> 44:49.833
Don't you have
a ship in your heart, Steve?

44:49.917 --> 44:51.292
Nope, not today.

44:51.833 --> 44:52.875
That's too bad.

45:00.292 --> 45:02.500
Work your legs, Tarek. What is that?

45:02.583 --> 45:05.833
Stop, stop, stop.
Don't stay in the center. Cut him off.

45:07.208 --> 45:09.000
-Mathis likes to...
-No.

45:09.083 --> 45:12.833
Cut him off. Don't stay in the center.
Cut him off and hit, okay?

45:12.917 --> 45:14.625
Okay, let's see it.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.917
Have fun.

45:25.542 --> 45:26.458
The thing is...

45:26.958 --> 45:30.833
as soon as he starts dancing,
you try to land a punch, Steve.

45:31.542 --> 45:33.250
Let him advance.

45:33.625 --> 45:35.875
Keep your hands up.

45:35.958 --> 45:38.583
And when he hits you,
then you can punch him.

45:38.667 --> 45:42.667
That's when you roll out three, four,
five punches.

45:43.583 --> 45:46.292
Then let him do his act. Let him dance.

45:53.375 --> 45:55.708
I'm not used to guys who box like him.

45:56.792 --> 45:57.917
See what I mean?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.417
Usually, guys engage. He...

46:00.500 --> 46:04.042
He does his combination,
you counter, but he's gone.

46:04.125 --> 46:06.292
<i>Because he wants to frustrate you,</i>

46:06.375 --> 46:08.375
<i>disorganize your boxing.</i>

46:08.458 --> 46:11.083
<i>How? By dancing.</i>
<i>And you get sucked in.</i>

46:17.250 --> 46:19.208
No, he's got it.

46:19.625 --> 46:21.167
He's got what?

46:21.250 --> 46:25.375
He's got it. He really sees
what's going on. He sees.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.083
You can, too, can't you?

46:28.292 --> 46:30.042
I can't see a damn thing.

46:30.125 --> 46:31.333
Steve, listen to me.

46:32.292 --> 46:33.292
Take a fly.

46:34.458 --> 46:38.417
A fly has eyes that aren't like ours.

46:38.500 --> 46:40.125
It has big weird eyeballs.

46:41.292 --> 46:44.917
What the fly sees
isn't what we see, right?

46:45.500 --> 46:46.333
<i>Yeah.</i>

46:49.000 --> 46:53.417
<i>For the fly, the world it sees through</i>
<i>its weird eyes</i>

46:53.500 --> 46:56.167
<i>is reality, is the truth.</i>

46:56.250 --> 46:57.292
<i>Are you with me?</i>

46:58.750 --> 46:59.625
<i>Yeah.</i>

47:00.708 --> 47:01.583
<i>Okay.</i>

47:02.500 --> 47:04.500
<i>Now us humans, with our eyes,</i>

47:04.583 --> 47:08.125
<i>we see colors and more precise shapes.</i>

47:09.542 --> 47:12.250
<i>And that's our reality.</i>

47:13.542 --> 47:14.458
<i>Get it?</i>

47:15.708 --> 47:16.542
<i>Yeah.</i>

47:20.417 --> 47:22.083
The fly says the same thing.

47:23.958 --> 47:25.292
What does the fly say?

47:26.875 --> 47:27.833
Think it over.

47:28.792 --> 47:31.917
Think about the fly
and you'll understand how you box.

47:36.083 --> 47:37.042
Be quick.

47:37.125 --> 47:39.458
That's it. The bag shouldn't move.

47:39.542 --> 47:41.708
It's just a pop-pop. Like this, look.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.542
No, not like that.

47:46.375 --> 47:49.708
Samuel says to hit it gently,
so the bag won't move.

47:49.792 --> 47:51.417
-Okay.
-Like this.

47:51.500 --> 47:54.375
All right. Hey there.
Aren't you saying hello?

47:56.167 --> 47:57.750
-Hi.
-What's that?

47:59.875 --> 48:00.708
Nothing.

48:01.083 --> 48:02.708
-What is that?
-Nothing.

48:03.625 --> 48:04.667
What happened?

48:05.792 --> 48:06.625
Nothing.

48:06.708 --> 48:08.958
What? Tell me. Did you get in a fight?

48:10.458 --> 48:11.292
Tell me.

48:13.833 --> 48:16.708
-What happened?
-Someone insulted you at school.

48:17.458 --> 48:19.542
-Who insulted me?
-An eighth grader.

48:20.375 --> 48:22.292
His dad saw you box and...

48:22.542 --> 48:23.500
And what?

48:24.708 --> 48:25.958
And what?

48:27.417 --> 48:28.542
It's a bad word.

48:28.625 --> 48:30.792
-What bad word?
-You'll yell at me.

48:31.875 --> 48:32.917
What bad word?

48:34.500 --> 48:36.417
His dad said you box like a pussy.

48:42.667 --> 48:44.042
Did he hit you first?

48:45.250 --> 48:46.083
No.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.542
You hit him first?

48:51.000 --> 48:53.375
Aurore, you never hit first.

48:53.458 --> 48:55.375
-He insulted you.
-So, what?

48:56.042 --> 48:58.833
You can't take an insult? Go to your room.

48:59.500 --> 49:01.625
I won't teach you any more combos.

49:07.208 --> 49:09.333
Clench your fist. Clench.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.458
It's war. Look at those punches.

49:13.542 --> 49:15.750
Right, left. That's real punching.

49:16.500 --> 49:17.458
You see it there.

49:18.167 --> 49:20.500
Every time he applies pressure,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.750
he wins, because that's his signature.

49:24.917 --> 49:27.042
Not yours. It's his signature. Look.

49:27.125 --> 49:28.500
He's a hunter.

49:28.583 --> 49:29.500
Exactly.

49:30.083 --> 49:31.042
Exactly.

49:31.458 --> 49:32.458
A hunter.

49:32.917 --> 49:35.083
He hunts. He never stops.

49:35.167 --> 49:38.375
-Until the guy drops.
-Okay. Thanks, Ali. Thanks, Malik.

49:39.458 --> 49:40.292
Tarek.

49:42.750 --> 49:44.250
What's the lesson here?

49:44.333 --> 49:47.375
-We have to change tactics.
-Tactics. Tactics--

49:47.458 --> 49:52.042
For this fight, more than any other,
we won't win with this. We win with this.

49:53.333 --> 49:55.958
We have to fight smart, Tarek. Very smart.

49:56.375 --> 49:59.083
We go in 30 to 40 seconds per round,
that's all.

49:59.167 --> 50:01.125
Then pull away. Move around.

50:01.583 --> 50:02.667
Circle around him.

50:03.250 --> 50:05.333
Like a mosquito, drive him nuts.

50:06.125 --> 50:07.667
Don't let him snooze off.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.375
Frustrate him.
Completely disorganize his boxing.

50:11.750 --> 50:14.042
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Take a walk.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.417
You want to say something?

50:17.083 --> 50:19.958
With all due respect,
I think you're doing...

50:20.042 --> 50:22.333
exactly the opposite of what's needed.

50:23.917 --> 50:25.000
I beg your pardon?

50:30.167 --> 50:31.167
Mathis...

50:32.042 --> 50:34.958
He's methodical,
he'll be expecting what you said.

50:37.958 --> 50:41.583
He'll be expecting exactly that.
It's what he does every time.

50:42.042 --> 50:43.500
What he doesn't like...

50:44.417 --> 50:46.417
is unpredictable boxers.

50:46.875 --> 50:48.417
And you're unpredictable.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.625
Let him do his thing.

50:56.667 --> 50:57.542
Thank you.

50:59.750 --> 51:00.583
Thank you.

51:00.667 --> 51:03.333
Out of 49 fights, how many did you win?

51:04.167 --> 51:05.500
-Thirteen.
-How many?

51:06.375 --> 51:08.250
-Thirteen.
-Thirteen, right.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.833
I'm glad you have an opinion,

51:11.917 --> 51:13.708
but save it for your pals at the pub.

51:14.083 --> 51:15.125
-Got it.
-Okay.

51:16.667 --> 51:17.875
Tarek, back to work.

51:24.208 --> 51:25.083
Hey, champ.

51:28.292 --> 51:29.458
I need to change.

52:07.625 --> 52:10.250
-What are you doing?
-Sorry, I was trying...

52:10.708 --> 52:11.833
Go ahead, show me.

52:20.875 --> 52:22.792
-Who is that?
-You.

52:23.667 --> 52:25.750
Me? Guess who I am.

52:30.542 --> 52:32.000
-Me?
-Can't you tell?

52:36.292 --> 52:39.625
Anyway... What about Mathis?
Put the glove down.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.292
I wanted to tell you that Omar
is a good coach, not a great one.

52:47.375 --> 52:48.208
Is that so?

52:49.250 --> 52:52.042
He's asking you to focus
on Mathis's mistakes...

52:52.417 --> 52:54.625
but you need to focus on his habits.

52:55.458 --> 52:58.167
And there's one thing he does every time.

53:00.708 --> 53:03.083
<i>When he gets in, he takes over the ring.</i>

53:03.167 --> 53:06.833
<i>He gets in the center, calls it home</i>
<i>and doesn't let anyone in.</i>

53:11.167 --> 53:13.250
If with every new round,

53:13.333 --> 53:17.042
<i>you take that position, let him circle</i>
<i>and keep him out...</i>

53:18.000 --> 53:19.417
<i>you break down his boxing.</i>

54:08.917 --> 54:11.417
Eight, nine, ten, eleven.

54:11.500 --> 54:14.583
You have eleven A-pluses, Aurore?
Eleven A-pluses.

54:14.958 --> 54:16.708
What's that? A-plus?

54:17.083 --> 54:18.708
-A-plus...
-Eleven A-pluses.

54:19.750 --> 54:21.917
-It's better than 20.
-Like 20/20?

54:22.375 --> 54:23.833
-Eleven 20/20s?
-Yeah!

54:25.750 --> 54:27.042
Really?

54:27.125 --> 54:28.667
Where'd you pick that up?

54:28.750 --> 54:29.708
Congratulations.

54:30.292 --> 54:33.083
You're the first in the family
to get so many...

54:35.167 --> 54:38.083
-Did you get good grades in seventh grade?
-I think so.

54:38.167 --> 54:39.917
You didn't make it to seventh grade.

54:45.125 --> 54:48.958
You said that if I got ten A-pluses,
I'd get a present.

54:49.042 --> 54:50.667
-I said that?
-Yeah.

54:51.208 --> 54:53.542
All right, then. Something inexpensive.

54:53.833 --> 54:54.708
It's free.

54:55.042 --> 54:56.333
Okay, you name it.

54:58.375 --> 55:00.458
-Anything I want?
-You name it.

55:01.625 --> 55:04.417
Can I go to your training fight?

55:05.042 --> 55:07.042
-My what?
-The public training.

55:07.583 --> 55:08.917
No, that's impossible.

55:10.542 --> 55:11.500
Why?

55:14.750 --> 55:16.417
Anything else, but not that.

55:17.042 --> 55:18.833
-Come on, Steve.
-No.

55:18.917 --> 55:22.833
It's all "excellent," "well done."
If it makes her happy.

55:22.917 --> 55:25.292
No, I told you, no fights...

55:25.750 --> 55:27.042
But why?

55:28.750 --> 55:32.333
-You said anything. It's not fair.
-Yeah, but not that.

55:32.625 --> 55:35.708
I told you before. Not the fights.

55:35.792 --> 55:37.750
I just don't want you to come.

55:37.833 --> 55:40.875
Ask for anything else. A bike, a Barbie?

55:40.958 --> 55:42.333
-Why?
-Because...

55:43.667 --> 55:46.000
-Because what?
-Because I said no.

55:49.500 --> 55:50.417
Come on.

55:50.833 --> 55:52.458
-Not you, too?
-Yes.

55:52.542 --> 55:55.208
-It's just training.
-Okay, I've heard enough.

55:55.292 --> 55:56.542
You said anything!

55:56.625 --> 55:58.875
-Why promise her stuff, then?
-Enjoy your meal.

56:00.458 --> 56:01.417
Too bad.

57:10.958 --> 57:12.000
Let's go, Tarek!

57:13.167 --> 57:14.500
Where's he at?

57:18.083 --> 57:19.000
There he is!

57:20.417 --> 57:21.417
Go, champ!

57:43.500 --> 57:44.750
Tarek, where's Ambre?

57:46.333 --> 57:49.250
-Who you here for?
-Both of you, but she's pretty.

57:49.500 --> 57:50.417
There's the champ!

57:53.458 --> 57:55.125
Show us some boxing!

57:55.208 --> 57:56.750
You wanna see some boxing?

57:58.417 --> 58:01.250
-Give us the noble art!
-Beautiful boxing!

58:01.792 --> 58:03.042
You're gonna get it.

58:07.083 --> 58:08.333
Who do I start with?

58:09.917 --> 58:12.417
-Okay, champ. Make it snappy.
-Pick the best one!

58:19.042 --> 58:19.958
Look at me.

58:23.125 --> 58:24.125
He's it.

58:24.208 --> 58:25.292
Give him a hand!

58:29.250 --> 58:30.417
Take it easy on him!

58:45.417 --> 58:47.208
Easy! That's it.

58:47.708 --> 58:48.708
Keep moving.

58:55.167 --> 58:57.958
Go to work on him, Ali! Go to work!

58:58.542 --> 58:59.917
Get in there!

59:04.792 --> 59:06.500
Back him into the ropes.

59:09.583 --> 59:11.708
That's it. Explosive leg work.

59:21.458 --> 59:22.417
You're the boss!

59:27.083 --> 59:28.292
Time!

59:29.333 --> 59:31.042
Time! Time!

59:31.458 --> 59:32.458
Time!

59:40.958 --> 59:43.375
This Saturday,
you're taking Mathis down!

59:44.333 --> 59:45.333
Looking good.

59:45.417 --> 59:47.000
Go ahead and have fun.

59:47.083 --> 59:50.167
Don't give it away.
Mathis' people are here.

59:50.250 --> 59:51.125
So, have fun.

59:51.208 --> 59:53.250
Are your legs still under you?

59:53.333 --> 59:54.167
Yeah.

59:54.792 --> 59:56.250
No, okay. Hop out.

59:56.333 --> 59:57.583
We're changing.

59:57.667 --> 59:58.875
Who do you want?

59:59.333 --> 1:00:01.000
-Who?
-Hey, Steve!

1:00:02.167 --> 1:00:03.375
-Steve.
-Hurry up.

1:00:03.458 --> 1:00:04.750
Get a move on.

1:00:05.792 --> 1:00:07.083
Before he gets cold.

1:00:13.083 --> 1:00:14.167
Get a move on!

1:00:14.250 --> 1:00:15.333
Next victim!

1:00:19.458 --> 1:00:21.292
Work your combinations.

1:00:21.375 --> 1:00:22.708
Piece of cake!

1:00:26.208 --> 1:00:28.042
Make some noise!

1:00:30.042 --> 1:00:32.292
That's for you, champ. All for you.

1:00:33.667 --> 1:00:36.292
Tarek! Tarek! Tarek!

1:00:40.708 --> 1:00:42.458
I want explosive leg work.

1:00:42.542 --> 1:00:45.250
Work your jab. On him, work your jab.

1:00:46.958 --> 1:00:47.958
Ready, champ?

1:00:50.917 --> 1:00:51.917
Wait a minute!

1:00:53.375 --> 1:00:54.458
Wait!

1:00:56.083 --> 1:00:57.333
His name's Steve.

1:00:57.583 --> 1:00:59.333
He's a good boxer. Brave.

1:01:00.167 --> 1:01:01.375
Tough luck!

1:01:01.458 --> 1:01:05.000
You know what my edge is on him?
I don't need headgear.

1:01:06.292 --> 1:01:07.292
No way, Tarek.

1:01:07.375 --> 1:01:10.375
You know why? Because he can't hurt me.

1:01:12.167 --> 1:01:14.333
-You can't do this.
-Don't worry.

1:01:14.417 --> 1:01:15.750
It's in four days.

1:01:15.833 --> 1:01:18.708
-What if you're injured?
-Why are you doing this?

1:01:18.792 --> 1:01:21.000
-It's pointless.
-Trust me.

1:01:22.042 --> 1:01:24.625
-Keep the advantage with this crowd.
-I got this.

1:01:26.042 --> 1:01:27.458
Take it easy on him!

1:01:34.583 --> 1:01:35.500
Wait!

1:01:36.292 --> 1:01:38.042
How long before he hits me?

1:01:38.125 --> 1:01:39.292
Ten rounds!

1:01:39.375 --> 1:01:41.500
Come on, champ. Get to work.

1:01:43.083 --> 1:01:45.625
I'll try one, to start. One round.

1:01:46.542 --> 1:01:48.667
Come on, Steve. Try your luck.

1:01:55.250 --> 1:01:56.167
Get ready.

1:01:57.875 --> 1:01:59.042
Fight!

1:02:03.333 --> 1:02:05.250
We want style, Tarek!

1:02:07.542 --> 1:02:09.083
Play with him!

1:02:09.708 --> 1:02:11.250
That's it, have fun!

1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:13.708
Cat and mouse! Come on!

1:02:18.375 --> 1:02:21.083
Good. Circle. That's good, champ.

1:02:21.708 --> 1:02:23.458
Explosive on the legs.

1:02:26.333 --> 1:02:28.208
Concentrate, champ. Work.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:35.917
Take out gramps!

1:02:36.542 --> 1:02:37.917
Knock him out!

1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.125
You call that boxing?
Show me how they box in Le Havre?

1:02:42.500 --> 1:02:43.792
Come on, Steve!

1:02:45.667 --> 1:02:46.583
Go to work!

1:02:49.083 --> 1:02:50.875
Show us how it's done in Le Havre!

1:02:52.417 --> 1:02:54.000
Let go... Let go...

1:02:55.042 --> 1:02:56.292
I'm right here.

1:03:00.167 --> 1:03:01.000
Come on!

1:03:03.125 --> 1:03:04.458
Bring it on!

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:06.125
I'm right here.

1:03:09.417 --> 1:03:10.458
Encourage him!

1:03:13.292 --> 1:03:14.625
Stay focused!

1:03:19.625 --> 1:03:21.208
Guard up, that's it!

1:03:34.125 --> 1:03:35.792
Kill him!

1:03:36.083 --> 1:03:37.417
Come on, Steve!

1:03:37.500 --> 1:03:39.333
Are you the real deal? Show us!

1:03:39.750 --> 1:03:40.958
Show them.

1:03:41.458 --> 1:03:42.750
It's now!

1:03:42.833 --> 1:03:44.042
Show them now!

1:03:44.792 --> 1:03:46.292
Harder!

1:03:47.542 --> 1:03:48.375
Like that!

1:03:48.833 --> 1:03:50.000
Steve, harder!

1:03:50.083 --> 1:03:51.375
Control!

1:03:53.542 --> 1:03:55.917
Tarek, where'd you find him?

1:03:57.292 --> 1:03:58.667
That's not boxing!

1:03:59.208 --> 1:04:00.917
The guy's useless!

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:01.875
Useless!

1:04:03.458 --> 1:04:04.792
Destroy him!

1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.417
Come on, finish him off!

1:04:09.667 --> 1:04:11.042
Finish him off!

1:04:17.167 --> 1:04:18.708
Stay focused.

1:04:19.167 --> 1:04:20.292
-Counter!
-Let's go.

1:04:32.167 --> 1:04:33.042
Ten seconds!

1:04:34.833 --> 1:04:37.000
Come on! Is that all you got?

1:04:42.833 --> 1:04:44.417
Time! Time! Time!

1:05:21.208 --> 1:05:22.958
-Don't you have the keys?
-No.

1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:25.167
-I didn't give them to you?
-No.

1:07:40.125 --> 1:07:41.125
Hey, Steve.

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:42.833
Over here.

1:07:59.750 --> 1:08:00.667
Have a seat.

1:08:05.125 --> 1:08:06.000
You okay?

1:08:06.458 --> 1:08:08.875
-Yeah, I'm good.
-Want something to drink?

1:08:09.375 --> 1:08:10.250
No, thanks.

1:08:13.458 --> 1:08:14.458
No more bets.

1:08:15.250 --> 1:08:18.208
I'm sorry about the other day.

1:08:19.208 --> 1:08:21.750
It was for show. That's what people like.

1:08:22.958 --> 1:08:24.333
No hard feelings?

1:08:24.917 --> 1:08:26.375
We're good. No worries.

1:08:27.792 --> 1:08:28.667
Wanna play?

1:08:29.250 --> 1:08:30.208
No, thanks.

1:08:31.250 --> 1:08:32.083
Come on.

1:08:40.750 --> 1:08:41.958
Five hundred on black.

1:08:42.625 --> 1:08:43.583
Place your bets.

1:08:49.208 --> 1:08:50.542
You're a brave man.

1:08:54.417 --> 1:08:55.833
When was your last win?

1:08:58.458 --> 1:09:00.458
-Three years ago.
-Three years!

1:09:02.792 --> 1:09:04.292
I would have quit already.

1:09:07.708 --> 1:09:08.750
I like it.

1:09:09.583 --> 1:09:10.875
You like taking hits?

1:09:11.167 --> 1:09:12.000
No...

1:09:14.375 --> 1:09:17.500
No, I'd rather not,
but we don't have your talent.

1:09:21.750 --> 1:09:22.625
Besides...

1:09:23.875 --> 1:09:26.500
having guys like you takes guys like me.

1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:28.333
Yeah.

1:09:36.750 --> 1:09:38.167
I've got a surprise for you.

1:09:40.042 --> 1:09:42.708
How'd you like to box
in Saturday night's opening fight?

1:09:43.667 --> 1:09:44.750
A guy got hurt.

1:09:46.333 --> 1:09:47.958
-This Saturday?
-Yeah.

1:09:49.750 --> 1:09:50.583
Yeah.

1:09:52.042 --> 1:09:52.875
Thanks.

1:09:54.250 --> 1:09:55.667
You're welcome. You deserve it.

1:10:00.792 --> 1:10:01.708
Wanna play?

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:03.583
-No, thanks.
-Go on.

1:10:03.667 --> 1:10:04.833
No, really. Thanks.

1:10:09.250 --> 1:10:11.625
Thirty-two red, even, high. No winner.

1:10:19.667 --> 1:10:20.542
See you soon?

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:26.292
Don't forget: take the center
and watch his right hand.

1:10:26.750 --> 1:10:27.667
Don't forget to win.

1:11:12.042 --> 1:11:13.000
Glass of port?

1:11:13.833 --> 1:11:15.042
No, thank you.

1:11:25.333 --> 1:11:27.375
-Jeez...
-Let me...

1:11:27.458 --> 1:11:28.333
Got it.

1:11:34.208 --> 1:11:35.708
You don't look so bad.

1:11:38.583 --> 1:11:39.417
How's the head?

1:11:41.375 --> 1:11:42.625
Not too bad.

1:11:44.583 --> 1:11:45.958
Sometimes I forget stuff.

1:11:46.042 --> 1:11:47.000
Who doesn't?

1:12:00.708 --> 1:12:01.542
Here.

1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:04.333
Thanks.

1:12:04.750 --> 1:12:06.125
When's the fight?

1:12:06.208 --> 1:12:07.833
-Saturday.
-This Saturday?

1:12:08.500 --> 1:12:09.708
That leaves no time.

1:12:10.667 --> 1:12:13.000
What am I supposed to do in three days?

1:12:15.417 --> 1:12:18.250
I started with you,
I wanted to finish with you.

1:12:21.208 --> 1:12:23.333
You have to win this one, sonny.

1:12:23.792 --> 1:12:26.208
You win your last fight. No choice.

1:12:26.500 --> 1:12:27.333
I know.

1:12:28.333 --> 1:12:30.125
And my daughter will be there.

1:12:31.375 --> 1:12:33.458
So, tell me, you were more of...

1:12:34.792 --> 1:12:36.167
a stylist, weren't you?

1:12:37.625 --> 1:12:39.250
-No.
-A puncher?

1:12:40.125 --> 1:12:40.958
No.

1:12:41.625 --> 1:12:42.833
So, what's your style?

1:12:45.667 --> 1:12:46.625
I'm a good chin.

1:12:50.417 --> 1:12:51.583
That's not a style.

1:12:54.583 --> 1:12:55.625
That's how I...

1:12:56.708 --> 1:12:57.625
It's my style.

1:13:09.250 --> 1:13:10.583
I have a surprise.

1:13:11.917 --> 1:13:12.750
What is it?

1:13:12.833 --> 1:13:15.083
Saturday, you're going to bed late.

1:13:15.167 --> 1:13:16.708
-Why?
-Guess.

1:13:17.917 --> 1:13:19.750
I don't know. Come on, tell me.

1:13:19.833 --> 1:13:20.917
We're...

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.792
-going to the movies?
-No.

1:13:27.458 --> 1:13:28.500
Having pizza?

1:13:29.292 --> 1:13:30.958
-Having pizza.
-No.

1:13:32.750 --> 1:13:36.333
I'm fighting my last fight on Saturday.
You can come.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:42.042
What's wrong?

1:13:50.333 --> 1:13:51.292
What's wrong?

1:13:53.042 --> 1:13:54.208
I don't want to go.

1:13:56.667 --> 1:13:57.958
Because of last time?

1:13:58.042 --> 1:14:01.500
-No, I don't care about that.
-So, what's the problem?

1:14:09.583 --> 1:14:10.792
What's the problem?

1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:16.917
When people look at you,
they're happy you're getting hurt.

1:14:17.917 --> 1:14:19.167
That doesn't matter.

1:14:19.250 --> 1:14:20.333
It matters to me!

1:14:25.417 --> 1:14:26.833
You're my dad, I don't want...

1:16:32.750 --> 1:16:33.875
Hurry up.

1:16:34.083 --> 1:16:35.208
What's the rush?

1:16:42.583 --> 1:16:43.750
Please, Mr. Jean.

1:16:46.708 --> 1:16:47.875
Give me the gloves.

1:16:49.375 --> 1:16:50.250
These.

1:16:52.417 --> 1:16:53.292
Okay.

1:16:57.083 --> 1:16:58.083
See you later.

1:17:52.708 --> 1:17:54.458
You idiot. One day, I'll...

1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:57.542
-How you feeling?
-She didn't come?

1:17:58.042 --> 1:17:59.875
No. My mother's babysitting.

1:18:04.958 --> 1:18:06.750
Come on, you can't smoke here.

1:18:30.792 --> 1:18:31.917
I'm proud of you.

1:18:32.708 --> 1:18:33.542
Proud of what?

1:18:34.917 --> 1:18:35.750
Proud of you.

1:18:36.500 --> 1:18:39.542
Aurore and Oscar are too.
We're super proud of you.

1:18:45.333 --> 1:18:47.708
But tonight, my love, do me a favor.

1:18:48.167 --> 1:18:49.375
Fuck him up.

1:18:50.333 --> 1:18:51.208
Promise?

1:21:07.625 --> 1:21:10.000
Is that your style? Brawling?

1:21:10.583 --> 1:21:14.667
Take a good look around,
it's the last time you see all of this.

1:21:16.042 --> 1:21:18.750
Tonight, you die a little. You understand?

1:21:20.042 --> 1:21:22.292
So, show me who you wanted to be.

1:21:22.375 --> 1:21:25.958
The one you could have been,
if someone had believed in you.

1:21:47.583 --> 1:21:52.083
Let's hear it
for the sixth and final round.

1:23:18.292 --> 1:23:19.708
Come on, Steve!

1:24:13.708 --> 1:24:15.250
Come on, Steve! That's it!

1:24:21.583 --> 1:24:22.750
Yeah, that's it!

1:24:40.208 --> 1:24:41.333
What's he doing?

1:24:45.250 --> 1:24:46.333
Come on, Steve!

1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.708
He's dancing. Dance, Steve, baby! Dance!

1:25:14.750 --> 1:25:18.625
And it's the end of the final round!

1:25:39.375 --> 1:25:44.583
I think these two deserve
more applause for giving it their all.

1:25:47.667 --> 1:25:50.875
Let's take off the gloves, please.

1:25:56.292 --> 1:25:59.583
And let's hear a special round of applause

1:25:59.667 --> 1:26:01.125
for the red corner,

1:26:01.833 --> 1:26:05.708
fighting today his 50th and final fight,

1:26:05.792 --> 1:26:08.792
Steve Landry!

1:26:16.167 --> 1:26:17.083
Shake hands.

1:26:20.167 --> 1:26:21.250
You're the best!

1:26:21.833 --> 1:26:25.125
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,

1:26:25.625 --> 1:26:26.917
the winner...

1:26:27.958 --> 1:26:30.042

1:26:36.792 --> 1:26:38.667
