WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:07.641
(loud rock music playing)

00:07.675 --> 00:10.078
MAN:
What about her?

00:10.111 --> 00:11.079
Mm-hmm.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.246
* I got no worries

00:12.280 --> 00:13.347
I like her hair.

00:13.381 --> 00:16.350
* And I don't know why

00:16.384 --> 00:18.352
Can I cut her?

00:18.386 --> 00:20.354
I don't need the money now.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.090
Okay.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.357
* Oh, I got to sing
with some disgrace *

00:23.391 --> 00:26.094
* I'm in no hurry

00:26.127 --> 00:27.728
No...

00:27.761 --> 00:30.331
* And I don't know why

00:30.364 --> 00:33.167
* I don't know why

00:33.201 --> 00:34.668
(whimpering)

00:34.702 --> 00:37.805
* Oh, no, no

00:37.838 --> 00:39.640
Shh.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.409
* Girls rock your boys

00:41.442 --> 00:42.676
Mmm.

00:42.710 --> 00:47.115
* We'll get wild, wild, wild

00:47.148 --> 00:49.483
(woman screaming)

00:49.517 --> 00:52.520
* Come on, feel the noise

00:52.553 --> 00:56.757
* Girls rock your boys

00:56.790 --> 00:59.493
* We'll get wild, wild, wild

00:59.527 --> 01:01.429
* Baby

01:01.462 --> 01:04.332
* Come on!

01:04.365 --> 01:06.367
*

01:38.466 --> 01:40.468
Really? Really, you want
a fight? You want a fight?

01:40.501 --> 01:42.536
'Cause I'm gonna win.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.405
Technology tantrum.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.540
Joining my club, McGee?

01:46.574 --> 01:48.209
No, I am not having a tantrum.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.477
This is just
what happens

01:49.510 --> 01:50.778
when a perfectly
rational machine

01:50.811 --> 01:52.546
behaves completely irrationally.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.482
Look at this. Look at this.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.517
BISHOP:
Okay.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.386
You have one
new e-mail-- so?

01:58.419 --> 02:00.421
Watch what happens
when I try and open it.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.224
Huh. Where is it?

02:03.257 --> 02:04.325
That's exactly my point.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.393
It's the most basic function

02:05.426 --> 02:08.262
of e-mail since
the invention of it,

02:08.296 --> 02:10.264
but this one refuses to open.
Hmm.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.333
(singsongy):
Morning!

02:12.366 --> 02:14.502
Oh, wow. That's
team spirit.

02:14.535 --> 02:17.538
Yes, Abby knitted this herself.

02:17.571 --> 02:21.275
It's not exactly my style,
but I wear it proudly.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.377
You know,
Abby made me some, uh, socks

02:23.411 --> 02:25.546
when I first joined here.
Very cozy.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.182
She made me this friendship
bracelet.

02:28.216 --> 02:31.752
Ooh. And what about you, Nick--
what'd she make you?

02:31.785 --> 02:34.188
(gasps)
Ooh, she forgot Nick.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.524
Oh, no, no, no--
Abby doesn't forget.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.427
I don't wear vests, okay?

02:39.460 --> 02:41.429
And I definitely don't
wear fu-fu colors.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.463
BISHOP: "Fu-fu"?
Yeah, uh, blue or something.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.964
I think she called it,

02:43.997 --> 02:46.334
uh, cobalt?

02:46.367 --> 02:49.403
Alex? (laughs)

02:49.437 --> 02:51.605
Mm! You look fantastic.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.507
I'm so glad it fits.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.509
Mm-hmm.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.511
Doesn't she look great, Nick?

02:57.545 --> 03:01.449
Oh, yeah, no one, no one
wears wool like, uh, like Alex.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.452
You know, it's the first
cold day of the year.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.986
You a little cold,
Nick?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.888
Yeah, well, I have, uh...

03:07.921 --> 03:10.424
I have a jacket, so, uh...

03:11.459 --> 03:13.227
I feel pretty
comfortable.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.563
Abby, you know,
I was wondering what is this

03:15.596 --> 03:17.265
side little pocket for?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.866
That's your
secret agent pocket.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.535
So you can hide things,
like, really stealthily.

03:21.569 --> 03:25.406
Like a-a microRecorder or
a safe deposit key or-or

03:25.439 --> 03:27.408
a cyanide capsule.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.777
I probably won't do the last
one, but thank you.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.580
McGee, Quinn,
grab your gear.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.482
Got a lead on our
missing petty officer.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.450
Kelly Ristow?
That's-that's amazing.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.851
She's been missing
for days.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.487
Dead or alive, boss?
Don't know.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.688
All they have is fingerprints.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.256
At a homicide.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.892
(siren chirps)

03:44.925 --> 03:46.627
(indistinct radio transmission)

03:46.660 --> 03:49.597
Come on, Bob.
We're live in ten.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.802
Got dressed up for your victim?

03:54.835 --> 03:56.937
Agent McGee,
thanks for coming.

03:56.970 --> 03:57.938
Detective Campbell.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.441
Saw that camera
crew out front--

04:00.474 --> 04:02.042
you wearing that tie
for the press conference?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.844
Wanted to get the word out
that a Navy petty officer

04:03.877 --> 04:05.713
is missing and may be

04:05.746 --> 04:07.348
a material witness.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.517
You called the media
to a crime scene?

04:09.550 --> 04:11.552
Gibbs.
Nice to see you, too.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.821
No press.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.789
My crime scene,
my rules.

04:15.823 --> 04:18.792
I invited NCIS here
as a courtesy.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.794
How about as a courtesy

04:20.828 --> 04:22.830
I don't kick your ass?

04:25.533 --> 04:26.734
You know what?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.769
Maybe I'll send
a press release.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.573
Agent Francis,
what do we know?
Well, I know

04:32.606 --> 04:34.842
you haven't returned
my last three phone calls.
Oh,

04:34.875 --> 04:36.577
uh, you know, um...
You've been

04:36.610 --> 04:38.579
meaning to call
but you forgot.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.815
You know what, no.
You're a really sweet guy,

04:41.849 --> 04:44.585
and we did have something
a while back, but

04:44.618 --> 04:46.754
it's just...
No buts. Hint taken.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.889
No hard feelings, okay?

04:48.922 --> 04:50.591
You'll be hard to stay mad at.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.692
Oh...

04:51.725 --> 04:52.993
So back to business.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.728
Petty Officer Ristow's
fingerprints

04:54.762 --> 04:56.597
were found
all over the basement.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.865
Right, but no
Petty Officer Ristow.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.467
Negative.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.602
Looks like this guy
kept her chained up.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.836
But then face met dumbbell,

05:02.870 --> 05:04.572
and she
got out of Dodge.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.441
Thank you.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.642
Thanks.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.010
Boss, we got a BOLO hit.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.513
TSA's holding
Petty Officer Ristow at Dulles.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.847
Airport?

05:13.881 --> 05:15.883
All right. On my way.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.653
Hey, Gibbs, where you off to?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.890
Right. You got it.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.693
That the dead guy's cell phone?

05:25.726 --> 05:26.627
Yeah, standard burner.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.761
Either never used

05:27.795 --> 05:29.530
or he deleted everything.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.832
So, uh, you don't mind
if I keep it.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.834
Can't. Procedure.
Come on.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.604
Um... I mean, Tim,
you heard him--

05:36.637 --> 05:37.771
I mean, it's his
crime scene.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.573
it's his evidence.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.509
You're right.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.843
I'm sorry, uh,

05:42.876 --> 05:45.012
Detective Campbell,
I apologize.

05:45.045 --> 05:48.716
We, uh, we took some crime
scene photos earlier. So, uh,

05:48.749 --> 05:50.951
if any of 'em could be of any
use, just let us know.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.420
Thanks.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.389
I think we're good to go.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.425
Dead body's all yours.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.763
WOMAN:
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 239...

06:03.797 --> 06:05.566
...passengers must board
at this time.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.501
Special Agent Gibbs?

06:07.535 --> 06:08.936
Gregg Rogers, TSA.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.504
It's a real honor, sir.

06:10.538 --> 06:11.705
You have our petty officer?

06:11.739 --> 06:13.474
Yeah, she's
locked up tight.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.942
Don't like
holding military.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.744
What'd she do,
exactly?

06:16.777 --> 06:19.046
Don't tell me if it
compromises national security.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.081
Although I will
take any secret to my grave.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.750
Is she in here?

06:22.783 --> 06:23.751
Yeah, it's our detention area.

06:23.784 --> 06:24.985
Open it.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.654
She's pretty beat up
and she keeps

06:26.687 --> 06:28.121
asking for her husband.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.657
Is she a spy?

06:29.690 --> 06:32.726
You don't have to say
if she is.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.795
(beeping)
Seriously?

06:34.828 --> 06:35.829
It's...

06:38.632 --> 06:40.000
Agent Yellow,
this is Agent Blue.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.636
What's the code
for the big metal door?

06:42.670 --> 06:44.505
Over.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.039
Come in, Agent Yellow.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.843
You got a key, Agent Blue?

06:49.877 --> 06:51.579
Oh, yeah.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.517
(both shouting)

06:56.550 --> 06:58.786
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop!
Get away from me!

06:58.819 --> 07:00.988
Get away!
Kelly, Kelly. Hey.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.591
(crying):
Help me!

07:03.624 --> 07:05.859
(sobbing)

07:14.502 --> 07:17.571
(rapid beeping)

07:17.605 --> 07:19.540
That mystery e-mail
still driving you nuts?

07:19.573 --> 07:21.475
It's not driving me nuts,

07:21.509 --> 07:23.110
it's just, it's annoying.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.746
Want to feel better?
How?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.681
Take a look at this.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.116
You have 98,000

07:29.149 --> 07:31.051
unread e-mails?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.720
98 plus.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.121
How? Why?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.623
Well, when I was
undercover I-I...

07:35.656 --> 07:37.725
I never checked them,
you know?

07:37.758 --> 07:40.227
So, I could never...
I could never catch up,

07:40.260 --> 07:41.862
so at some point
I just quit trying, man.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.597
How do you sleep at night?

07:43.631 --> 07:46.233
Oh, on my back. Naked.
Fresh air feels nice.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.001
GIBBS:
I need a sitrep.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.604
Uh, boss, Petty
Officer Ristow

07:50.638 --> 07:52.740
spent the night in the hospital.
She's being treated

07:52.773 --> 07:55.509
for malnutrition,
minor injuries.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.077
Now, physically,
she'll be okay,

07:57.110 --> 07:58.812
but psychologically,
it's another story.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.748
Yeah. Quinn and Bishop
are with her now.

08:00.781 --> 08:01.715
The husband?

08:01.749 --> 08:03.250
M.I.A.
Pinged his phone.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.053
Nothing.
BOLO out on him and his car,

08:06.086 --> 08:09.657
a 1985 Oldsmobile
Cutlass Supreme.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.791
What do we know about him?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.660
Squirrelly.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.927
Direct quote
from Agent Francis.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.663
Well, where is Francis?

08:15.696 --> 08:16.997
Ristow's not
a missing person anymore.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.666
Our case now.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.133
Chris and Kelly
were married

08:20.167 --> 08:21.902
five years ago.
They live in

08:21.935 --> 08:23.671
Wilmington, Delaware.
He works

08:23.704 --> 08:25.806
as a night watchman
for a law firm.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.741
No kids.
And his record is spotless.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.810
Why'd she go to the airport?
Unknown.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.779
No airline charges
on their credit cards.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.615
There any connection between
the husband and the kidnapper?

08:34.648 --> 08:37.785
No. Just a psychopath who wanted
a pretty girl in his basement.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.287
Yeah, well, does the
psychopath have a name?

08:40.320 --> 08:43.824
Yes, Olek Lazarenko. Ukrainian.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.192
Real piece of work.
It's actually faster

08:45.225 --> 08:47.661
to list the crimes
he didn't commit.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.129
Getting his face
smashed in by a dumbbell

08:49.162 --> 08:50.631
seems pretty appropriate.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.999
He deserved it.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.701
Go to where
the husband works.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.703
See what they know.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.906
I know this is difficult,
but we have to

08:58.939 --> 09:00.941
ask you a few questions.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.582
Is this the man
who kidnapped you?

09:09.917 --> 09:11.585
(crying)

09:12.920 --> 09:14.054
Did you kill him?

09:15.823 --> 09:18.792
I had to.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.763
Am I under arrest?
No.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.231
Not remotely.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.299
You're the victim here.
It was clearly

09:26.333 --> 09:27.901
self-defense.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.838
Can you tell us
how you were kidnapped?

09:32.072 --> 09:35.943
Well, I'd just
gotten home from my shift.

09:35.976 --> 09:39.112
Started unloading groceries.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.914
Around what time?

09:40.948 --> 09:42.816
Uh, around midnight.

09:42.850 --> 09:46.253
I was putting stuff away, and...

09:48.656 --> 09:49.923
and suddenly

09:49.957 --> 09:52.793
there was a hand on my mouth.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.296
Kelly, when you escaped,

09:56.329 --> 09:58.098
why not go to the police?

09:58.131 --> 09:59.800
Why go to the airport?

09:59.833 --> 10:02.135
It's where Chris
said to meet him.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.639
You spoke to Chris,
your husband?

10:05.673 --> 10:08.408
After I escaped...

10:08.441 --> 10:10.110
I just started running.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.112
And I borrowed
some man's cell phone.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.182
I called Chris, and he said

10:15.215 --> 10:17.951
we needed to meet
at the airport right away.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.787
Why?

10:19.820 --> 10:21.822
To leave the country.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.825
He said
he'd explain later.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.060
But he wasn't at the airport.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.331
Can I go home now?

10:31.364 --> 10:33.701
I'm sorry. We need to keep you
in protective custody.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.103
Why do I need protection?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.205
That animal

10:38.238 --> 10:39.439
acted alone.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.974
Are you sure?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.812
Where was Chris
when you were taken?

10:44.845 --> 10:47.815
At work... graveyard shift.

10:47.848 --> 10:51.719
Have to ask-- were you
and Chris fighting recently?

10:51.752 --> 10:53.220
Wait... what?

10:53.253 --> 10:55.288
You don't think--?

10:55.322 --> 10:58.759
No, no, no.
Chris didn't do anything.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.928
He's in danger.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.932
We think you're the one
in danger.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.068
From my own husband?

11:08.101 --> 11:09.469
QUINN: Kelly, it
was the Navy

11:09.502 --> 11:12.205
who reported
your unauthorized absence

11:12.239 --> 11:14.141
when you failed to show up
for duty.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.244
You were gone for five days

11:17.277 --> 11:19.880
and your husband never
reported you missing.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.485
McGEE:
Okay, let's try this again.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.021
There is an e-mail;
it shows that there's an e-mail,

11:28.055 --> 11:29.823
it insist there's an e-mail,
but when I go to it,

11:29.857 --> 11:31.258
there is no actual e-mail.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.126
It's like it disappeared

11:33.160 --> 11:36.029
into the Bermuda Triangle
of electronic transmissions.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.165
McGee, just turn it off and on;
that's what I do.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.900
Torres, I appreciate the help,
okay?

11:39.933 --> 11:41.935
But that is very version seven.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.070
No.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.237
No, no, no. Not me.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.840
I am running version 9.4.3.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.508
Yes.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.110
No. I don't have
time to hold.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.344
Good-bye.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.848
What are you doing?

11:54.882 --> 11:56.483
Well, you know, this place
pretends to be fancy,

11:56.516 --> 11:58.752
but look at this piece of crap.

11:58.786 --> 11:59.987
It's a knockoff.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.421
Hmm. How do you know?

12:01.454 --> 12:04.057
I studied sculpture when I
was undercover in Holland.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.492
My instructor said

12:05.525 --> 12:08.028
I was a keen observer
of the human form.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.797
Admiring our bust?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.932
Yes. In a manner of speaking.
(laughing)

12:11.965 --> 12:13.066
It's, uh,
one of a kind.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.902
Made from the, uh,

12:14.935 --> 12:17.170
the finest marble.
I brought it back

12:17.204 --> 12:18.405
from Florence, myself.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.073
McGEE: Uh, NCIS,
Special Agent McGee.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.942
This is Special Agent Torres.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.543
Ned Senders,
Sullivan Brady.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.045
Gentlemen.
TORRES:
Hello.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.181
Let's, uh, go to
our conference room.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.017
Chris ran security at night.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.085
Prompt, polite, hard worker.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.221
He was an excellent employee.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.522
"Was."

12:35.555 --> 12:37.825
Quit five days ago.

12:37.858 --> 12:38.959
Now I know why.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.928
You ever meet his wife?

12:40.961 --> 12:42.963
Maybe once or twice

12:42.996 --> 12:44.998
at the firm's
Christmas party.

12:45.032 --> 12:48.836
Was she ever found?
McGEE: She was. Alive.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.204
Unfortunately,
Chris is now missing.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.807
Oh, God.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.475
Terrible.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.878
If there is anything
we can do to help...

12:57.911 --> 13:01.448
Actually, Ned,
um, you mind if I call you Ned?

13:01.481 --> 13:04.384
I have a question
about your bust.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.987
You want to talk
about the sculpture?
Yes, yes, I'm...

13:07.020 --> 13:09.189
I'm a keen observer
of the human form.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.461
Excuse me, Mr. Brady.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.963
Yeah?

13:15.996 --> 13:18.131
Um, I hope you don't mind,
I wanted to ask you

13:18.165 --> 13:19.933
a few more questions
about Chris.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.201
Did you know him well?

13:21.234 --> 13:22.469
Actually, yeah.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.938
Uh, I'm a night owl,
so I work late.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.040
He and I would have
long talks about life.

13:27.074 --> 13:30.077
Life.
So marriage, as well?

13:30.110 --> 13:33.180
Sure.
Kelly was a frequent topic.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.348
Uh, not to speak out of school.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.951
Oh, no. Please, do.
The man is missing.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.552
She cheated on him.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.022
He confided in me
a few years ago.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.858
I gave him the name
of a good divorce attorney.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.226
He never called.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.962
Figured that he and Kelly
patched things up.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.563
Hmm.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.598
(doorbell rings)

13:51.631 --> 13:55.102
I'm guessing Chris Ristow's
not home, Bishop.

13:55.135 --> 13:58.038
So you're what--
gardening?

13:58.071 --> 13:59.873
Nope. There's
always a spare key.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.408
Mm.
And it's never
under the mat anymore,

14:01.441 --> 14:03.643
but it is here.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.513
I call it front-
stoop fishing.
Hmm.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.982
(grunts)

14:09.016 --> 14:12.319
Oh! Uh-huh.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.987
I got it.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.056
Yep.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.225
(lock clicking)

14:23.196 --> 14:25.632
(door creaks, closes)

14:40.513 --> 14:42.082
BISHOP:
Clear.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.550
Clear.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.086
Whew.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.154
They are messy.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.656
Not even a chuckle?

14:49.689 --> 14:50.924
Ha.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.562
Hmm. Kelly's groceries
are put away.

14:55.595 --> 14:59.132
Yeah, which means Chris has
been here since she disappeared.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.537
The Ristows really like
their dog.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.538
Aw.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.175
QUINN:
Look at Frank.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.209
Dogs love me.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.444
(calling):
Frank. Come, come.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.580
I'm gonna pack her
a suitcase.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.515
Give her a little
taste of home.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.953
Laptop's here along
with a really nice watch.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.721
They weren't thieves.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.390
They were looking
for something specific.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.659
Yeah, but what?

15:26.693 --> 15:29.262
How did Quinn get this SIM card

15:29.296 --> 15:30.730
if it wasn't even
our crime scene?

15:30.763 --> 15:33.400
Maybe it fell
into her secret agent pocket.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.235
Maybe!

15:35.268 --> 15:37.504
Okay, so you
know that delete

15:37.537 --> 15:39.006
doesn't mean delete-delete,
right?

15:39.039 --> 15:40.340
What do you got, Abs?

15:40.373 --> 15:42.009
Text messages

15:42.042 --> 15:43.410
from the trash bin

15:43.443 --> 15:45.312
magically reincarnated
in front of your eyes.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.014
Okay, so I'm gonna play

15:47.047 --> 15:48.148
the dead guy, Lazarenko.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.750
And you're gonna
be Number One,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.185
the mysterious person
that he was

15:52.219 --> 15:53.120
communicating with.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.421
(low voice):
I got her.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.622
Now what?

15:56.789 --> 15:58.225
Gibbs!

15:58.258 --> 15:59.559
I can't have
a conversation by myself.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.328
It never stopped you before.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.198
I got her.
Now what?

16:05.232 --> 16:08.235
We hold her for a while.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.103
How long?

16:10.137 --> 16:12.105
Till I make a deal.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.673
What can I do to her?

16:13.706 --> 16:15.575
Whatever... you want.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.676
See?

16:16.709 --> 16:18.278
Petty Officer Ristow

16:18.311 --> 16:19.379
wasn't some random

16:19.412 --> 16:21.281
kidnapping victim, Gibbs.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.750
She was targeted
by someone.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.585
Someone who was telling
her kidnapper what to do.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.655
Yeah, and someone who
is still out there.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.100
KELLY RISTOW:
Hi, honey. Me again.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.602
Please call me.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.404
Please.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.474
Something's wrong.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.043
What if he's been kidnapped?

16:50.077 --> 16:52.345
Is there any reason why Chris
would want to disappear?

16:52.379 --> 16:53.680
What?

16:53.713 --> 16:56.049
No. Why?

16:56.083 --> 16:58.185
Well, you said he wanted
to leave the country.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.253
Yeah, but not without me.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.788
When your kidnapper

17:01.821 --> 17:03.556
was on the phone,
could you hear what he said?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.692
No.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.760
Whenever he came downstairs,

17:07.794 --> 17:12.199
he would always blare
that stupid song.

17:12.232 --> 17:17.104
Kelly, before we got to
your house someone broke in.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.640
What happened?

17:20.673 --> 17:22.775
Someone tore the place apart
looking for something.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.445
Looking for what?

17:25.478 --> 17:27.780
We were hoping
you could tell us.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.282
No.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.118
Look, we have to ask.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.819
Have you had an affair?

17:34.454 --> 17:35.722
We need you to be honest.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.291
We're trying to find
your husband.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.297
It was when we first
got married.

17:44.331 --> 17:47.867
Okay, an old boyfriend,
but he would never do this.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.836
I need you to write down
his name.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.142
Biggest mistake of my life.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.110
Look, we're past it, okay?

17:57.144 --> 17:58.845
Chris forgave me.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.514
You sure about that?

18:03.683 --> 18:06.553
Oh, McGee, put
those dogs away, man.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.655
(chuckling):
You're gonna scare
the trick-or-treaters.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.858
You know, Abby, uh,
made these for me,

18:11.891 --> 18:13.560
when I first started
13 years ago.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.895
I wear them anytime I know
I'm gonna work in the lab.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.232
She never mentions it,
but I know she appreciates it.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.734
So you change your socks
when you work downstairs?

18:21.768 --> 18:22.802
Mm-hmm.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.371
And they've lasted
you 13 years?

18:24.404 --> 18:25.905
Well, the trick is
you don't wash them.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.141
GIBBS:
Okay, what do we know?

18:28.175 --> 18:29.709
Well, boss,
a lot of evidence is

18:29.742 --> 18:31.278
stacking up
against the husband.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.879
Well, then, tell me, McGee.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.148
Well, one, he's a scorned man.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.749
I mean, she says
he may be over it,

18:36.783 --> 18:38.185
but it could be
on the back burner on simmer.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.919
TORRES: Yeah, and number
two, his credit is shot.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.354
He's in major debt.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.855
And three months behind
on the mortgage.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.291
McGEE:
Number three,

18:44.324 --> 18:47.160
Kelly Ristow has
an insurance policy.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.595
Half a million dollars.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.830
Chris is its sole beneficiary.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.166
Yeah, if she dies,
his problems go away.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.436
So he hires Lazarenko
to kidnap and torture her.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.937
That's why he never
reported her missing.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.173
His plans changed
when she escapes.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.441
Who ransacked the house?

19:01.474 --> 19:02.642
We think Chris did it,
to make it seem like

19:02.675 --> 19:03.876
he was being chased.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.778
Yeah, then why meet her
at the airport?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.180
He didn't.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.481
And we're still solving
that mystery.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.882
Look at this, boss.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.319
Chris's cell phone records
from that morning.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.321
Now, at 9:21 a.m.,

19:14.354 --> 19:16.223
he gets a call from
an unknown number.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.725
Yeah, that's Kelly
saying she escaped.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.393
And two minutes later,
at 9:23,

19:20.427 --> 19:22.562
he places a call to this number.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.864
Now this number belongs
to Dakota James,

19:24.897 --> 19:26.399
Kelly Ristow's sister.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.868
Lives in Delaware,
near the Ristows.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.803
Bishop.
Yes, Gibbs?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.372
We're sending you an address.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.241
DAKOTA JAMES:
Yeah, he called.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.210
He said that they had found her
and they were meeting up.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.212
Where's my sister?

19:39.246 --> 19:43.250
She's safe with us, but
Chris never showed up.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.584
Any idea where
he could have gone?

19:44.617 --> 19:46.686
What do I know?
They don't tell me anything.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.488
I'm the embarrassment.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.257
Why can't you find him?

19:50.290 --> 19:51.624
Isn't that your job?

19:53.293 --> 19:54.661
We're doing it.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.896
How's their marriage?

19:56.929 --> 19:57.997
Solid.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.599
It's the best thing she's got.

19:59.632 --> 20:00.900
Hmm.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.603
Oh, you're asking about
the cheating.

20:03.636 --> 20:04.704
That's water under the bridge.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.838
They're over that.

20:05.872 --> 20:06.939
Mm-hmm.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.275
All right.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.709
If the brother-in-law
contacts you,

20:09.742 --> 20:10.943
you'll give us a call.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.912
(calling out):
Frank. Come here.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.247
(whistling)
Hey, what are you doing?

20:14.281 --> 20:16.916
(Frank barking)
Oh, hi.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.951
QUINN:
Aw, that's their dog.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.387
Bishop, how did you know?

20:20.420 --> 20:21.921
Well, Frank is a shredder.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.324
I saw hairs on Dakota's sweater.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.026
All right, Dakota,
Chris was here.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.261
Why don't you tell
us where he is?

20:28.295 --> 20:29.462
I really can't.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.334
He made me promise not to tell.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.937
I need a drink.

20:37.970 --> 20:38.938
Talk now.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.307
You can drink later.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.875
(Frank barking)

20:42.909 --> 20:44.544
ABBY:
So he finds out his wife
is alive,

20:44.577 --> 20:46.479
and the first thing he does
is make sure his dog's okay?

20:46.513 --> 20:48.315
You know how people are
with their animals.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.882
Uh, I love animals,

20:49.916 --> 20:51.984
but I think I would
love my husband more.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.354
I mean, I don't know
or maybe, you know.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.556
McGee, I'm sorry.
I don't know.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.291
What do you mean you don't know?
You know everything.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.526
Well, I don't know everything.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.060
Did you try just turning it on,
turning it off?

21:01.093 --> 21:02.562
Is Torres rubbing off
on you now?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.397
Abby, can you help me fix this
or not?

21:04.431 --> 21:06.499
McGee, it's one e-mail.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.968
And I'm just, you know,
I'm kind of busy solving murders

21:09.001 --> 21:10.036
and fighting crime.

21:11.103 --> 21:11.804
Hey, Gibbs.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.039
Laptop.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.041
Chris Ristow
has a secret.

21:15.074 --> 21:18.478
And you have three chances
to guess what it is.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.313
Wrong.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.515
Wrong. Wrong.

21:22.549 --> 21:25.518
He's the CEO of an
international corporation.

21:25.552 --> 21:28.087
I thought he was
a night watchman.
Exactly.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.022
QFire, LLC.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.924
Formed in 2012

21:31.958 --> 21:34.060
and has offices in
the Cayman Islands,

21:34.093 --> 21:36.363
Panama, and Ireland.
Never heard of 'em.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.599
Yeah, neither has the Internet.
QFire has no Web site,

21:39.632 --> 21:41.534
no employees,
and no products.

21:41.568 --> 21:45.104
But according to federal tax
records, $3 million in assets.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.074
Not bad for a night watchman.
Yeah, here's the kicker.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.343
QFire was incorporated

21:50.377 --> 21:52.512
and represented by

21:52.545 --> 21:55.648
Thomas, Senders,
Brady & Goldfarb.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.784
That's the law firm
that Chris worked at.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.119
Who owns QFire?
Um...

22:00.152 --> 22:02.355
I haven't been able
to figure that out yet.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.923
There's just so much legal

22:03.956 --> 22:05.792
mumbo jumbo
in all these papers.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.427
McGee, help Abby
dig into these files.
(phone ringing)

22:07.460 --> 22:08.461
Find our owner.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.496
Yeah, Bishop?

22:09.529 --> 22:10.530
Gibbs, they were headed
to Mexico.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.131
He made his sister-in-law

22:12.164 --> 22:13.966
buy the airline tickets.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.036
And then she said
he left for the airport.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.070
Well, he didn't make it.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.138
Right, he had one stop to make

22:19.171 --> 22:20.973
to get his passports.

22:21.007 --> 22:21.974
Where?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.510
Safety deposit box

22:23.543 --> 22:24.811
in a bank in Wilmington.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.646
Go. Go, go.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.683
Yep. '85 Oldsmobile,
registered

22:30.717 --> 22:33.085
to Chris Ristow.
Look at this.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.688
This broke.

22:37.156 --> 22:40.427
Well, here's her passport.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.694
Where's his?
Right here.

22:42.729 --> 22:45.665
Yeah.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.401
Okay, he comes back
from the bank

22:48.435 --> 22:50.537
with the passports.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.704
Someone surprises him.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.473
They fight.

22:53.506 --> 22:56.576
He drops the passports and
he breaks off the indicator.

22:59.779 --> 23:02.449
Uh, Quinn?

23:06.853 --> 23:09.489
Ooh. That's not oil.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.130
(groans, exhales)

23:34.681 --> 23:35.882
(knocking)

23:37.617 --> 23:39.886
Hey, Ellie.
Thanks for bringing these.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.421
I feel more like myself.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.059
What's the matter?

23:47.093 --> 23:49.829
Kelly...

23:51.798 --> 23:53.766
No.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.435
I'm so sorry, Kelly.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.839
(crying):
He's not dead.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.107
It's not true.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.843
You-you made a mistake.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.180
(crying)

24:08.214 --> 24:11.484
What happened?

24:11.518 --> 24:14.086
He was shot trying to get
to you at the airport.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.789
Why?

24:16.823 --> 24:19.826
We are gonna find his killer.

24:25.532 --> 24:28.134
(sobbing)

24:29.201 --> 24:31.838
A stitch in time saves nine.

24:31.871 --> 24:35.708
Do you know the derivation
of that phrase, Mr. Ristow?

24:35.742 --> 24:38.244
Uh, I'll tell you later.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.947
Jethro, how do
you always know

24:40.980 --> 24:43.616
just when I've
finished my autopsy?

24:43.650 --> 24:45.217
Instinct.
Well,

24:45.251 --> 24:47.920
timing is everything,
as my mother used to say

24:47.954 --> 24:50.690
when she fed me two teaspoonfuls

24:50.723 --> 24:52.258
of Radio Malt.
It was a mixture

24:52.291 --> 24:54.861
of riboflavin, calciferol,
and molasses.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.095
Delicious.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.897
It's Chris Ristow?

24:57.930 --> 24:59.899
One to the head,
two to the heart.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.801
Abby has the bullets.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.136
Got a time of death, Duck?
I would estimate

25:04.170 --> 25:06.939
he was in that trunk,
ooh, a good 48 hours.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.575
Got anything else, Duck?

25:08.608 --> 25:12.111
Yes. He was shot in the kneecap
before he was killed.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.946
Tortured?
Apparently.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.983
The killer was after something.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.250
You think?

25:18.284 --> 25:20.987
How 'bout $3 million?

25:21.020 --> 25:22.221
Ah.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.156
What were we talking about?

25:24.190 --> 25:26.626
Oh, yes-- a stitch in time.

25:26.659 --> 25:27.560
(grunts)

25:27.594 --> 25:29.662
(creepy laughter)

25:29.696 --> 25:31.063
So, what are you gonna be
for Halloween, Torres?

25:31.097 --> 25:33.232
TORRES:
For Halloween?

25:33.265 --> 25:36.669
Girl, you know I've been
in costume my whole career.

25:36.703 --> 25:39.305
Well, you haven't been
a ghost or a hot dog.

25:39.338 --> 25:42.174
Don't be so sure.
Oh, my.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.645
NCIS. First my office,
now my home.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.279
I'm hosting a party here.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.716
Well, it looks
pretty spooky.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.350
Don't worry, this
won't take too long.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.052
This is Special
Agent Quinn.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.921
Uh, do you recognize this?

25:56.222 --> 25:57.757
Yes, that's ours.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.927
I'll bet you want to know
why Chris Ristow is CEO.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.695
It has piqued
our interest, yes.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.031
Ugh, tax code is complex.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.266
Too complex to explain here.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.268
Oh, well, good news.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.303
We are fast learners,

26:11.337 --> 26:14.306
so just, uh, give
us your best shot.

26:14.340 --> 26:17.309
Okay. QFire is what's called
a shell company.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.679
Uh, a stand-in
for someone's money.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.681
Our clients are
from all over the world,

26:21.714 --> 26:24.684
so when we create a shell,
our employees act as...

26:24.717 --> 26:26.719
principals in name only.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.320
So a shell corp, uh,

26:28.354 --> 26:30.122
hides the client's identity?

26:30.156 --> 26:32.391
Oh, that doesn't
sound shady.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.061
So, QFire and the 3 million?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.729
Chris never had access to it.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.198
Look, you're barking up
the wrong tree here.

26:39.231 --> 26:42.168
This is standard practice
in our business.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.771
And what business is that,
exactly?

26:44.804 --> 26:46.138
The asset protection business.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.974
Who owns QFire?

26:48.007 --> 26:49.175
One of our clients.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.843
Which one?

26:50.877 --> 26:52.779
(chuckles)

26:52.812 --> 26:54.380
One who wants
to remain anonymous

26:54.413 --> 26:56.115
and has a legal right
to do so.

26:56.148 --> 26:59.051
I got pumpkins to carve.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.286
Definitely not
hiding anything.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.288
He's just trying
to protect his assets.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.356
(chuckles, groans)

27:04.390 --> 27:06.158
You will be fine, Dale.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.359
He's just like a...

27:07.393 --> 27:09.395
like a big ol' pussycat.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.063
You just want to
scratch his belly.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.065
And relax, breathe.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.300
Scratch Agent Gibbs' belly?

27:14.333 --> 27:16.268
That seems inappropriate.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.369
(elevator dings)

27:17.403 --> 27:18.304
Showtime, Dale.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.105
Hey, Gibbs!

27:19.138 --> 27:21.708
You remember Dale
from Accounting.

27:21.741 --> 27:22.975
Sure.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.276
Pale Dale. How are you?

27:24.310 --> 27:25.277
Thanks for your help.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.079
Take it away,
Dale.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.881
Right. Um...

27:30.249 --> 27:32.785
A-Agent Gibbs...

27:33.953 --> 27:34.887
(moans)

27:34.921 --> 27:36.723
Is he okay?

27:36.756 --> 27:39.358
"QFire Limited Liability
Corporation conducted a double

27:39.391 --> 27:41.160
"Irish arrangement
with at least four

27:41.193 --> 27:42.428
offshore companies
and/or multinational

27:42.461 --> 27:44.764
"shell corps which form
a 'Dutch Sandwich,'

27:44.797 --> 27:46.799
which is wholly/partially
owned by the..."
Sit down.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.168
Yes, sir.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.370
You look paler.

27:52.371 --> 27:53.773
Okay, so I had a feeling

27:53.806 --> 27:55.742
this might happen. McGee,

27:55.775 --> 27:57.343
nesting dolls.
Yes.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.410
Uh, boss, imagine

27:58.444 --> 28:01.313
this little guy here
is QFire.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.414
You mean the doll?

28:02.448 --> 28:04.851
Yes. Shell corps
like QFire

28:04.884 --> 28:06.986
get bought and sold
all the time.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.988
And sometimes they merge
with other shell corps.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.857
Sometimes they
disappear completely,

28:10.890 --> 28:13.325
because they only exist
on paper.

28:13.359 --> 28:17.363
And all that buying and selling
and merging

28:17.396 --> 28:20.099
makes it impossible to find
out who the true owner is.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.034
Impossible for everyone
except for...

28:22.068 --> 28:25.337
Dale, who is
87% sure

28:25.371 --> 28:28.775
that the true owner of the whole
shebang is Leonard Weiss.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.209
Who?

28:30.242 --> 28:32.511
Uh, boss,
that's Leonard Weiss,

28:32.544 --> 28:34.480
of Weiss Resources Group.

28:34.513 --> 28:35.848
ABBY: Runs one
of the biggest

28:35.882 --> 28:37.784
government contractors
in the country.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.852
What's his motive
for kidnapping and murder?

28:39.886 --> 28:43.055
Remember the $3 million
that was on QFire's books?

28:43.089 --> 28:44.356
It's gone missing.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.793
Into Chris Ristow's

28:46.826 --> 28:48.327
bank account?
Dale hasn't

28:48.360 --> 28:51.898
figured that out yet,
but he is working on it.

28:51.931 --> 28:54.533
Working. Hard. Very hard.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.503
Where is Weiss right now?

28:57.536 --> 29:00.940
Well, he lives in New York,
but he's here right now

29:00.973 --> 29:02.541
for a senator's fundraiser.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.843
Well, bring him in.

29:04.944 --> 29:08.414
Oh, no, no.
You sit down.

29:13.552 --> 29:15.321
Leonard Weiss?

29:15.354 --> 29:17.256
You're positive?

29:17.289 --> 29:18.958
It's where the evidence leads.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.326
I know Weiss has
major political sway...

29:20.359 --> 29:23.129
Well, there's
the understatement of the year.

29:23.162 --> 29:26.565
Gibbs, I know you don't worry
about Washington repercussions.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.267
And neither should you, Leon.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.402
But that's not how life works.
We are days away

29:30.436 --> 29:33.372
from the most important election
in American history.

29:33.405 --> 29:36.408
And arresting, even questioning,
a man as influential

29:36.442 --> 29:37.977
as Leonard Weiss
will reverberate

29:38.010 --> 29:39.411
all the way down the ticket.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.514
McGee will be very discreet
when he picks him up.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.951
Gibbs, I don't like it.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.853
Director, this man
could be behind

29:46.886 --> 29:49.188
a kidnapping
and a murder for hire.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.990
Emphasis on "could."

29:51.023 --> 29:53.192
We have motive
and we have opportunity.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.526
But do we have proof?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.929
Circumstantial evidence
is overwhelming.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.497
That's not good enough!

29:58.530 --> 30:00.366
I--

30:00.399 --> 30:02.835
I need concrete evidence

30:02.869 --> 30:05.571
linking Leonard Weiss to
the petty officer's kidnapping

30:05.604 --> 30:07.573
and Chris Ristow's murder.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.375
I don't have that.

30:09.408 --> 30:12.078
Well, then you have your answer,
Special Agent Quinn.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.414
(knocking)

30:15.447 --> 30:18.417
(whistles)
Hey, where's my invite?

30:18.450 --> 30:20.452
There's a party in here.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.889
Well, maybe I should just get
a revolving door.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.423
(laughs)

30:26.525 --> 30:28.460
Not a joke.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.363
Gibbs, heads up, a partner
at Ristow's law firm

30:31.397 --> 30:32.498
wants to meet.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.400
Secretly.

30:36.335 --> 30:40.439
I don't know why people
meet in parking garages.

30:40.472 --> 30:43.509
I mean, it's, like,
a movie thing.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.545
How you holding up, Torres?

30:46.578 --> 30:48.280
Truth?

30:48.314 --> 30:51.283
Yeah. Truth's good.

30:51.317 --> 30:54.620
Well, you know, um...

30:54.653 --> 30:57.589
leaving undercover, uh...

30:57.623 --> 30:59.892
it's hard.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.460
Makes you stronger.

31:01.493 --> 31:04.496
(chuckles)

31:04.530 --> 31:07.266
You like them words
of wisdom, Gibbs.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.501
Sounds like I heard
it in church.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.471
No, not church.
Life.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.473
Yeah, well,
life's a bitch.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.242
(chuckles):
Yeah.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.311
Amen, bubba.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.613
Gibbs, uh, you may
have noticed

31:21.647 --> 31:24.616
that it's been a little
awkward between Abby and me.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.019
No.

31:27.053 --> 31:31.090
I'm not wearing the cobalt
vest if you ask me to.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.025
I didn't ask you to.

31:33.059 --> 31:36.662
But you're part of a family now,
so act like it, Torres.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.364
Your family is crazy.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.565
(laughing):
Yeah, but they're still family.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.134
(tires screeching nearby)

31:55.614 --> 31:57.549
Sullivan Brady?

32:01.753 --> 32:03.922
Special Agent Gibbs.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.693
Let's do this before
I change my mind.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.595
Everything you need
to put that son of a bitch away

32:09.628 --> 32:11.230
for a really long time.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.531
Who?

32:12.564 --> 32:13.599
Leonard Weiss.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.234
Read it and see.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.969
Nutshell.

32:17.003 --> 32:19.071
Weiss owns QFire.

32:19.105 --> 32:21.273
As you know, QFire is nothing.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.475
It's a mask,
it's a shell.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.445
Chris siphoned out all
the assets-- three million--

32:26.478 --> 32:28.614
hoping no one
would notice.

32:28.647 --> 32:31.650
Weiss noticed, and when
Chris didn't give it back,

32:31.683 --> 32:33.685
Weiss hired people
to snatch his wife.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.654
Prove it.

32:35.687 --> 32:37.623
It's all in the file.

32:37.656 --> 32:40.626
There is a paper trail proving
that Ristow embezzled the money.

32:40.659 --> 32:44.163
There's wire transfers
from Weiss to the kidnapper.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.332
Lazarenko.

32:47.766 --> 32:48.800
Why are you doing this?

32:48.834 --> 32:52.571
Once upon a time,
I got into law to help people.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.406
Over the years,
I've gotten really good

32:54.440 --> 32:56.442
at doing really bad things.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.411
I'm finally gonna do something
that feels good.

32:59.445 --> 33:02.048
Chris was my friend.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.083
I want to make things right.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.486
(car engine starts)

33:09.521 --> 33:11.490
(car door closes)

33:16.195 --> 33:18.564
McGee. Weiss-- where is he?

33:18.597 --> 33:21.067
Boss, I just tailed Weiss
to a commuter airport.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.368
His G5 took off.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.403
Put agents on the tarmac
in New York.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.604
He's not flying to New York.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.406
They just filed
a new flight plan.

33:27.439 --> 33:28.340
Where?

33:28.374 --> 33:29.475
Serbia.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.189
No problem. No.
Happy to help.

33:43.222 --> 33:45.391
Yeah.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.628
Okay, I'll bite. What?

33:49.661 --> 33:52.298
I just fixed
my little e-mail kerfuffle.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.599
BISHOP:
Ah, congrats.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.301
You turned it off and on?

33:55.334 --> 33:56.268
Yes. I did do that.

33:56.302 --> 33:59.505
I also discovered a bug
in the software.
Huh.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.340
You hacked
into private software?

34:01.373 --> 34:03.142
I'm a white-hat hacker.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.443
That was customer service.

34:04.476 --> 34:05.844
They confessed that
there has been

34:05.877 --> 34:08.080
a glitch
in the software for years.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.782
Wait. So you just fixed it

34:10.816 --> 34:14.186
for the whole world?
Yeah. I mean,

34:14.220 --> 34:15.721
for anyone
with that e-mail provider, sure.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.323
BISHOP:
So,

34:17.356 --> 34:18.524
what was the phantom e-mail?

34:18.557 --> 34:21.227
A Nigerian prince wanted

34:21.260 --> 34:23.729
to give me five million dollars.

34:23.762 --> 34:24.830
Ah.
GIBBS: Okay.

34:24.863 --> 34:26.265
Walk me through it.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.300
Oh, night watchman Chris Ristow

34:28.334 --> 34:30.702
discovers that he's president of

34:30.736 --> 34:32.338
Leonard Weiss's
shell corporation,

34:32.371 --> 34:34.240
then figures out
how to embezzle

34:34.273 --> 34:35.374
all of its cash.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.875
And then Weiss finds out,

34:36.908 --> 34:38.444
he retaliates by hiring

34:38.477 --> 34:43.315
Mr. Creepy here to kidnap
Petty Officer Kelly Ristow.

34:43.349 --> 34:46.318
Yeah, but with a dumbbell
to the chin, she jumps.

34:46.352 --> 34:49.255
So Weiss hires a hit man
to kill her husband.

34:49.288 --> 34:52.191
Then Weiss flies to Serbia,
which, by the way,

34:52.224 --> 34:54.160
doesn't have an extradition
treaty with the U.S.

34:54.193 --> 34:56.495
Surveillance cameras
at the bank?

34:56.528 --> 35:00.166
Obscured by an armored car.
How's that for irony?

35:00.199 --> 35:01.567
We find our missing
three million?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.235
Not yet.
Dale's looking.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.736
GIBBS:
Think the wife was in on it?

35:04.770 --> 35:06.172
No way.
Maybe.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.639
GIBBS:
Ah.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.741
Weiss is in MTAC.
QUINN:
You're good Gibbs,

35:09.775 --> 35:11.343
but how are you going
to get Rockefeller

35:11.377 --> 35:12.644
to incriminate himself,

35:12.678 --> 35:15.181
and come back to the States
to get arrested?

35:15.214 --> 35:16.682
Words of wisdom.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.784
Gibbs is pretty good at those.

35:18.817 --> 35:23.222
Quinn and Bishop, bring Petty
Officer Ristow back here. McGee,

35:23.255 --> 35:25.324
you stay with Abby
and Pale Dale.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.659
Find that three million, kids.
Go.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.762
Gentlemen, Zdravo!

35:30.796 --> 35:32.498
That's "hello" in Serbian.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.166
I wish we were speaking

35:34.200 --> 35:35.867
under different circumstances,
Mr. Weiss.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.437
Oh, nonsense.
I have nothing to hide,

35:38.470 --> 35:40.606
not even what's under this robe.

35:40.639 --> 35:45.244
Well, removing that robe
won't be necessary, sir.

35:45.277 --> 35:48.447
We're investigating the death
of Chris Ristow.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.582
I have no idea who that is.

35:50.616 --> 35:53.452
He stole three million dollars
from you.

35:53.485 --> 35:57.256
So, he's not Navy,
he's a politician.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.591
We have a petty officer
under protective custody,

35:59.625 --> 36:02.261
and her husband in our morgue.

36:02.294 --> 36:05.464
What are the chances
you're behind that?

36:06.965 --> 36:09.401
Go.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.604
I thought
this was about my taxes.

36:12.638 --> 36:16.708
You own a shell corporation
called QFire, LLC.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.478
I own 33 shell corporations,

36:19.511 --> 36:22.281
but I pay my taxes,
and I do it legally.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.916
Let me be blunt, gentlemen.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.819
You're asking me
about three million dollars.

36:27.853 --> 36:30.756
If this Ristow guy
really stole that from me,

36:30.789 --> 36:32.624
I'd be disappointed,

36:32.658 --> 36:34.860
but not homicidal.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.895
My condolences to the widow.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.365
This conversation's over.

36:41.467 --> 36:42.734
We're being played.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.537
Agreed. But by who?

36:47.005 --> 36:49.275
Embezzling
three million dollars?

36:49.308 --> 36:51.577
He would never,
ever do that.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.745
But he did.

36:53.779 --> 36:56.348
We couldn't even afford a night
at the movies.

36:56.382 --> 36:59.551
I sewed patches on his shirts
so they'd last longer.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.622
This shirt still smells
like him.

37:05.524 --> 37:09.461
If he really stole the money,
where is it?

37:14.400 --> 37:17.035
Maybe Chris gave it to you.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.670
What?

37:18.704 --> 37:20.939
Yeah. He steals it,
you hide it,

37:20.972 --> 37:24.310
playing the innocent wife,
the victim.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.278
What are you talking about?

37:26.312 --> 37:29.315
Why don't you level with me,
Kelly?

37:29.348 --> 37:32.250
You and Chris planned
this together, huh?

37:37.556 --> 37:39.291
What was that?

37:39.325 --> 37:40.692
Being a good investigator.

37:40.726 --> 37:42.461
By accusing the victim?

37:42.494 --> 37:44.296
I wanted to see if she
was hiding something.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.464
Come on, she's not.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.499
Well, I know that now,
but it's amazing

37:47.533 --> 37:49.535
what a little kick in
the pants can shake loose.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.370
You got to trust my
instincts, Bishop.

37:51.403 --> 37:53.271
They're sometimes right.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.707
You sure about
this one, Dale?

37:55.741 --> 37:57.709
Uh, it's a statistical
probability.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.778
Okay, he's here. He's here.

37:59.811 --> 38:02.013
Now, Dale, no stage fright.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.715
Just talk.
(clears his throat)

38:03.749 --> 38:05.684
Agent Gibbs, step right up.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.553
Now, according
to my examination of the case...

38:07.586 --> 38:08.854
ABBY: Chris Ristow
was not a thief.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.556
He's a whistleblower.

38:10.589 --> 38:11.957
Sorry, Dale.
I couldn't wait.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.493
He never stole money from Weiss?
McGEE: No.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.595
The only thing he stole was
information from his employer.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.730
He found out the firm
was helping its clients

38:18.764 --> 38:21.700
cheat the U.S. government out of
hundreds of millions of dollars.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.068
Chris wanted
to expose them.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.870
ABBY:
We found these e-mails

38:24.903 --> 38:27.005
between Chris and a reporter
at the Washington Leader.

38:27.038 --> 38:31.410
He was gonna give her a flash
drive that was gonna incriminate

38:31.443 --> 38:33.979
the entire firm and
all of the clients.
Never gave it to her.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.581
Nope.
Night before the trade-off,

38:35.614 --> 38:36.648
the wife was kidnapped.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.116
Someone at the firm

38:38.149 --> 38:39.718
must have found out what he did.

38:39.751 --> 38:42.488
Who?
Does the name Sullivan
Brady ring a bell?

38:42.521 --> 38:44.956
He's been playing us
like a fiddle.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.892
Boss, the documents
that were given to you

38:46.925 --> 38:48.494
in the parking garage
were doctored

38:48.527 --> 38:50.128
to make it look like
Chris was embezzling money.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.897
Never happened.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.765
Wire transfers to
the kidnapper?

38:53.799 --> 38:55.634
From Brady himself,
posing as Weiss.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.536
And I matched the bullets
from the crime scene.

38:57.569 --> 38:58.804
Smith and Wesson
nine millimeter.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.439
And guess who registered

39:00.472 --> 39:03.375
that exact same weapon
two years ago?

39:03.409 --> 39:06.512
Well, don't just
stand there. Go! Move!

39:06.545 --> 39:08.046
Arrest the bastard!

39:18.624 --> 39:20.158
Is that him?

39:20.191 --> 39:23.495
What a terrible, awful,

39:23.529 --> 39:24.630
grumpy,

39:24.663 --> 39:26.665
joyless, unhappy man.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.000
Want to go in
and take his statement?

39:29.034 --> 39:31.770
Only if I can punch him in
the nose. Where's Gibbs?

39:31.803 --> 39:34.940
He's telling Petty Officer
Ristow the news.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.108
That sounds like Chris.

39:37.142 --> 39:40.546
He always said that no one
was above the law.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.013
GIBBS:
Well, he's right.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.817
But why didn't he tell me
what he did?

39:45.851 --> 39:48.186
I would have been proud.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.789
I think he was
trying to protect you.

39:50.822 --> 39:55.126
He died doing
what was right.

39:55.160 --> 39:59.164
Just wish he could have
delivered that flash drive.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.135
Maybe he still can.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.738
But I don't know where it is.

40:06.772 --> 40:09.575
Well, there's only one place

40:09.608 --> 40:12.511
in this house nobody's looked.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.446
Where?

40:14.480 --> 40:19.017
Noticed that the collar Frank
the dog was wearing-- different

40:19.050 --> 40:20.919
than the one in the photo.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.589
Yeah, that was Chris.

40:23.622 --> 40:27.659
He insisted Frank needed
this brand-new...

40:33.632 --> 40:36.768
(laughs)

40:36.802 --> 40:39.170
(sighs)

40:48.580 --> 40:50.982
Hey.

40:51.016 --> 40:53.652
What did I miss?

40:53.685 --> 40:54.920
Yay!

40:54.953 --> 40:56.655
You're looking
good, Torres.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.023
Oh, feeling good, Quinn.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.791
I'm feeling-feeling...
feeling good.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.661
Cold outside, so...

41:03.662 --> 41:05.096
Oh. All right.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.633
Okay. (laughs)

41:07.666 --> 41:09.635
(laughs)
