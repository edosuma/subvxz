This is too many succulents.

00:05.433 --> 00:07.266

have too many succulents.

00:13.266 --> 00:14.300
- I don't know.
- The 16th time

00:14.300 --> 00:16.000
that he's jogged by
our house today.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.567
- Why is he wearing
a garbage bag?

00:17.600 --> 00:19.567
- He's sweating it out "Silver
Linings Playbook" style,

from that divorce.

whatever it is,

00:30.567 --> 00:32.166
he shouldn't be making
that kind of noise.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.533
That's a guttural noise

00:33.567 --> 00:35.133
that you should keep
in the privacy

00:35.166 --> 00:37.100
of your own home.

it's a very delicate
situation.

- Is that right?
- Most of what I'm about to

00:45.734 --> 00:47.300
tell you I learned on
"The Steve Harvey" show.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.533
- Okay, you're watching
that too much, I think.

00:48.567 --> 00:51.333
- What Steve says is,
"When MEN are in pain--"

00:51.333 --> 00:53.333
- Oh, God, you can't say
any of those words

00:53.367 --> 00:55.600
or in that way.
- When Steve Harvey is in pain,

00:55.600 --> 00:57.133
- himself...
- No.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.700
- He says you need to be
very careful.

00:58.734 --> 01:00.667
You need to let them
come to you.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.200

a one-arm pushup,

01:02.200 --> 01:03.600

06:34.500 --> 06:36.467
- Everything down for me,
'cause this is offensive.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.467
- Fine. "If you don't fix
your own problems,

06:38.467 --> 06:42.166
you spend all your time fixing
other people's problems."

06:42.200 --> 06:44.567
- Do you not want me to fix
your jinky garbage disposal?

06:44.600 --> 06:46.000
- What's wrong with
my garbage disposal?

06:46.033 --> 06:47.166
- Someone put
a rump roast in there.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.300
- Oh...
- I gotta get it out!

06:48.333 --> 06:50.333
- I gotta trap that!
- I put that down there.

06:50.367 --> 06:52.333
Was I not supposed to
do that?

06:52.333 --> 06:54.233
And can you fix it?

06:54.233 --> 06:55.600
And don't tell Maggie.

06:55.633 --> 06:57.467
- You--
- Thank you so much!

06:58.500 --> 06:59.467
- Hey, Phil.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.734
Candy said you wanted
to see me?

07:00.767 --> 07:02.100
- Yeah.
Come on in, Maggie.

07:02.133 --> 07:05.433
Look, I don't know how
to say this but, uh...

07:05.467 --> 07:06.767
- God, what's going on?

07:06.767 --> 07:09.367
[pop]
- Ha ha! Congratulations!

07:09.400 --> 07:11.567
You're Employee of the Month!

07:11.600 --> 07:13.200
- Oh, my God,
that was terrifying!

07:13.233 --> 07:15.200
I thought you were dying!

07:15.233 --> 07:16.333
- I am dying...

07:16.367 --> 07:18.500
to give you this!

07:18.500 --> 07:22.100
And a $20 gift certificate
to Rosie's!

07:22.100 --> 07:24.300
- No. No, no, no, Phil.
I can't accept these.

07:24.333 --> 07:25.767
You should give them
to Candy.

07:25.767 --> 07:27.367
- No can do, muchacha.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.600
Look, I think we both
can agree

07:28.633 --> 07:30.367
that these last couple
of months here

07:30.400 --> 07:32.200
have been pretty special.
I want you to start

07:32.233 --> 07:34.500
thinking about coming on
full-time.

07:34.533 --> 07:36.500
- Oh, no.
The reason I took this job

07:36.533 --> 07:38.200
was 'cause I wanted
the flexible hours

07:38.233 --> 07:39.333
for me and my daughter.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.233
- I like to think
we here at Rosie's

07:41.266 --> 07:43.667
are also your family.
For real.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.367
- Okay, well, that's sweet,
but I--

07:45.400 --> 07:47.066
- Look Maggie,
listen to my words.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.467
You're smart.
You're capable.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.633
You're never getting
motor-boated in the walk-in.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.500
- Well...
- And you're the best waitress

07:53.533 --> 07:55.200
I've ever seen.
- [laughs] Okay.

07:55.233 --> 07:56.633
And if you think
about it...

07:56.667 --> 07:59.133
you could work here

07:59.133 --> 08:02.100
the rest of your life.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.400
Huh? Okay, here,
come on!

08:04.400 --> 08:06.600
Gimme a big old hug,
would you?

08:06.633 --> 08:08.066
[chuckles]

08:08.100 --> 08:10.367
Oh, actually, turn your
head towards my webcam.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.633
And if you could
shed some tears,

08:11.667 --> 08:13.133
it would help me a ton.

08:13.133 --> 08:15.100
[whispering] Trying to
get on "Undercover Boss."

08:15.133 --> 08:16.633
[chuckling]

08:16.667 --> 08:18.567
- Check out this garbage!

08:18.567 --> 08:21.000
- Employee of the Month?
That's great!

08:21.033 --> 08:22.166
- No, it's not!

08:22.200 --> 08:23.533
He told me
I'm his best waitress.

08:23.567 --> 08:24.767
- I thought you liked
Rosie's.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.300
- I do, I do,
it's just, since Charlotte,

08:27.333 --> 08:28.433
I feel like--
[hammering]

08:28.433 --> 08:30.000
God, what is that noise?

08:30.033 --> 08:31.300
- Oh, it's Mark.
He's on the roof.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.266
- What? I thought he was just
fixing the water pressure.

08:33.300 --> 08:34.667
- He's spinning out
about the divorce.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.133
It's clearly
a cry for help.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.500
- I don't think
that's what's happening.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.667
[clatter, thudding]
[Mark grunting]

08:39.700 --> 08:41.033
Ah!

08:41.066 --> 08:42.166
[thud]
- Aah!

08:42.166 --> 08:44.633
- Oh, God, help me!

08:49.300 --> 08:49.400
.

08:49.467 --> 08:49.767
- Oh, it's a code 3.

08:49.767 --> 08:50.166
- Oh, it's a code 3.
Officer down!

08:51.600 --> 08:53.233
- It's all right--I think
you have a sprained ankle.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.700
- Ooh, that's--[hisses]
Ooh, I need some milk.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.300
I need some chocky milk.

08:57.333 --> 08:58.367
- Chocky milk?

08:58.400 --> 09:00.734
- Do you have pain
anywhere else?

09:00.734 --> 09:02.467
Okay, you don't need
to go to the hospital.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.333
You just need RICE: Rest, ice,
compression, elevation.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.200
- No, Emma, tell her--tell her
I gotta go to the hospital.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.667
Tell her to take me--talk some
sense into your woman, please.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.533
- Okay, Mags, why don't you
just take him to the hospital?

09:10.567 --> 09:12.433
- I'll stay here with Char Bar.
- Okay. But the doctor's

09:12.467 --> 09:14.467
just gonna say the exact
same thing I just said.

09:14.467 --> 09:16.066
- I don't think so.

09:16.066 --> 09:17.200
- Yeah,
all you need is RICE:

09:17.233 --> 09:19.300
Rest, ice, compression,
elevation.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.567
- Sound familiar, huh?

09:20.600 --> 09:22.333
- But Doc, seriously,
give it to me straight.

09:22.367 --> 09:23.600
Am I ever gonna walk again?

09:23.600 --> 09:25.166
- Your ankle's gonna be fine.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.734
But you do appear to be
a child trapped in a man's body,

09:27.734 --> 09:30.066
so...you know,
get that checked out.

09:30.066 --> 09:32.166
- Is it okay if I suck on
some ice chips?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.333
- You can eat whatever
you want.

09:33.367 --> 09:34.734
It's just a sprained
ankle.

09:34.734 --> 09:36.734
- Maggie, can you get me
some frosty ice chips?

09:36.734 --> 09:39.033
- Sure.
Coming right up.

09:39.066 --> 09:41.033
- Just make sure that
they're really frosty, though.

09:41.066 --> 09:42.066
- You got it.

09:46.066 --> 09:47.734
- Oh, my God. Maggie?

09:47.767 --> 09:49.567
- Michaela!
- Maggie!

09:49.600 --> 09:50.700
Shut your face!

09:50.734 --> 09:52.300
[laughing]

09:52.333 --> 09:54.600
- How are you?
- What are you doing here?

09:54.633 --> 09:56.166
- My friend
fell off a roof.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.600
- Oh...
- He's fine, though.

09:57.633 --> 09:59.066
- Oh, it's so good
to see you!

09:59.100 --> 10:00.100
- So good to see you
too!

10:00.100 --> 10:01.166
- What hospital
are you at?

10:01.200 --> 10:03.500
- Oh, I'm, uh,
I'm not working.

10:03.533 --> 10:06.200
I'm not doing nursing.
No. I just, um...

10:06.233 --> 10:08.467
Yeah, I had to leave
school when my parents--

10:08.500 --> 10:09.767
- God, yes, I'm so sorry.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.233
- That was so devastating.
- Yeah.

10:11.266 --> 10:13.166
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.500
So I moved home to take
care of my brother,

10:15.533 --> 10:18.567
and then I started working
and had a baby and got married,

10:18.600 --> 10:20.166
and not in that order
but, you know...

10:20.200 --> 10:21.467
- Oh, yeah.
I have three of my own.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.734
- How are you still
standing?

10:22.767 --> 10:23.767
- I don't know!

10:24.000 --> 10:25.367
[both laughing]

10:25.400 --> 10:27.633
Oh, God, we really
missed you when you left school.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.000
- Oh, thank you
so much.

10:29.033 --> 10:32.066
- Mr. Sanchez has
left his bed again.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.400
Mr. Sanchez--freeze!

10:33.433 --> 10:35.000
Okay, I gotta go deal
with this.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.133
It was so good
to see you again!

10:36.166 --> 10:37.734
It just kills me
you're not a nurse.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.133
You were such a natural.

10:40.133 --> 10:43.066
Mr. Sanchez, put your pants
back on right now!

10:47.033 --> 10:49.667
- Can I get you anything else,
your Highness?

10:49.700 --> 10:51.533
- Find "Murder, She Wrote."

10:51.567 --> 10:53.667
- Oh, my God, you've
gotta stop watching those!

10:53.700 --> 10:56.000
I'm in pain, and I gotta
go to Cabot Cove,

10:56.033 --> 10:57.467
'cause nothing bad
ever happens there.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.667
- Only bad things
happen there!

10:58.700 --> 11:00.266
There's a murder there,
like, every week!

11:00.300 --> 11:03.100
- Yeah, and then Jessica solves
it because she's a crime fighter

11:03.133 --> 11:04.700
and a novelist,
and that's sexy as hell.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.300
Oh, my Gosh.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.700
"Hooray for Homicide" or "We're
Off to Kill the Wizard"?

11:08.700 --> 11:10.400
[clicks tongue, inhales]

11:10.433 --> 11:12.567
"Wizard" it is.
Play.

11:12.567 --> 11:15.000
That's my jam right there.
[Murder She Wrote Theme plays]

11:15.033 --> 11:17.700
- Oh, my God, Mark is
driving me crazy!

11:17.734 --> 11:20.166
He's been hogging the TV
for the past 24 hours.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.567
Why does he have to
stay with us?

11:21.567 --> 11:23.767
- Because he doesn't have
anyone else to take care of him

11:24.000 --> 11:25.700
except for single dads
and strippers.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.266
- Well, at 2:00,
Steve Harvey's

11:27.300 --> 11:29.633
gonna force a bunch of moms
to face their fear of clowns,

11:29.667 --> 11:31.033
so will you tell him
I need the TV?

11:31.066 --> 11:32.266
- You need to tell him
yourself,

11:32.300 --> 11:34.567
because I have to go to work
because what adults do is go

11:34.567 --> 11:36.033
- to jobs they don't like...
- Shh!

11:36.033 --> 11:37.166
And be Employee
of the Month.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.166
- Please, Maggie!
- Work it out!

11:39.166 --> 11:42.567
- You're not getting any tips
with that attitude.

11:42.567 --> 11:45.133
[video game sounds]

11:45.166 --> 11:47.467
Ugh. What now?

11:47.467 --> 11:49.467
- What is this crap?
- A video game.

11:49.467 --> 11:50.734
It's called
Fatal Blowout 2.

11:50.767 --> 11:52.734
Fatal Blowout 2?

11:52.767 --> 11:55.333
That's what happened to me
when I went to Chico's

11:55.333 --> 11:56.333
- Mexican Restaurant.
- Disgusting.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.533
Completely
and utterly disgusting.

11:57.567 --> 11:59.200
- What's the story
with this game?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.600
It's a post-apocalyptic
world

12:00.633 --> 12:03.200
where all the spiders
have become sentient.

12:03.233 --> 12:04.734
- Who's that guy?
- That is Lor-krieg.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.433
He is the King of all Spiders.

12:06.467 --> 12:08.166
- Well, I would not trust him.
- I don't trust him.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.467
That's why I'm throwing
grenades at him.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.033
- You shouldn't go
closer to him.

12:11.066 --> 12:12.200
- I have to go in there
to drop a grenade--

12:12.200 --> 12:13.333
- Oh, no, his friend's--

12:13.333 --> 12:14.467
his friend's gonna
get you from behind.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.700
She's getting you
from behind!

12:15.734 --> 12:17.600
- She's got you from behind!
- Come on--

12:17.600 --> 12:18.700
- Oh!
- Damn it!

You are destroyed.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.700
He just cold blood
spider murdered you!

12:22.734 --> 12:24.200
- You think you can do better?

12:24.200 --> 12:25.567
- Oh, no, I know
I could do better.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.467
- All right. Let's go.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.333
- Fine.
But I would like to be

12:29.367 --> 12:31.233
a woman with
enormous boobs.

12:31.266 --> 12:32.767
- You can't--no--
- And have that tank top--

12:32.767 --> 12:34.233
A tight tank.
- There are no women

12:34.266 --> 12:35.600
- in the game.
- What?

12:35.633 --> 12:37.200
- There are no women
in the game.

12:37.233 --> 12:38.600
Everybody's a guy,
okay?

12:38.633 --> 12:40.100
- Well, that's classic.
Know what I mean?

12:40.133 --> 12:42.367
What kind of message does that
send to the women of America?

12:42.367 --> 12:44.200
- If it means that--
- That we can't pick up a gun

12:44.233 --> 12:46.300
and murder spiders?
Well, yes, we can.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.767
- Please stop talking.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.567
- It was just so crazy
running into her, you know?

12:50.600 --> 12:53.166
I hadn't thought about
nursing school in years.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.767
And I was almost finished.

12:54.767 --> 12:57.633
- Yeah? I thought I was
gonna be a big Broadway star

12:57.667 --> 12:59.367
after I graduated
high school.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.467
- You could still do it.
You got the pipes.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.567
- Ugh, nah. Turns out
Broadway's in New York City.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.633
I hate New York City.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.200
I don't care what
Billy Joel says.

13:06.233 --> 13:08.300
- But isn't there like
a tiny part of you

13:08.333 --> 13:10.133
that still wants to try?

13:10.133 --> 13:12.133
- Hey, guys.
Birthday, table nine.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.133
It's twins!

13:14.166 --> 13:16.400
- Ha!
Who needs New York?

13:16.433 --> 13:18.667
I got my own little
Broadway right here.

13:41.667 --> 13:42.734
- Suck it all night long!

13:42.767 --> 13:44.133
That's where you want it!

13:44.133 --> 13:46.066
[overlapping comments]
Yes!

13:46.100 --> 13:47.633
game voice: Well done, soldier.
- Jacked up in the lip

13:47.667 --> 13:48.667
- and sliced up.
- Oh!

13:48.700 --> 13:50.500
Now we get to rest
and reap our rewards

13:50.533 --> 13:53.700
because we killed up
all them spiders.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.166
- Prepare for battle.
- All right,

13:55.200 --> 13:56.667
drop ship is coming down.
It's touching down.

13:56.700 --> 13:57.667
Here we go.
- In three, two, one.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.233
- I'm gonna be on six--

13:59.266 --> 14:01.033
- I got a wolf spider
at 2:00--

14:01.033 --> 14:02.166
[overlapping chatter]
You got it?

14:02.200 --> 14:03.533
Ooh, I got it, I got it!

14:03.567 --> 14:05.033
- Oh, sweet!
- Bam, that's good!

14:05.033 --> 14:06.000
[phone buzzing]

14:06.033 --> 14:07.700
Oh. Oh, your
boyfriend's calling.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.433
- Oh--what?
Oh, crap, crap, crap!

14:09.433 --> 14:11.300
Oh, release the gas!
[phone buzzing]

14:11.333 --> 14:13.000
Okay, you know what?
Call back.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.166
[game sounds continue]

14:14.166 --> 14:15.567
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

14:15.567 --> 14:17.033
Mark, use the spin snapper!

14:17.066 --> 14:18.533
- No, no, no, no--hold--
- Where are you?

14:18.567 --> 14:20.667
- I'm being killed here!
- I'm gonna change to crossbow.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.100
- It's more noble.
- No, no, no!

14:22.133 --> 14:23.734
We don't have time for noble!
This is war!

14:27.500 --> 14:27.633
.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.133
- Michaela?

14:28.133 --> 14:28.300
- Michaela?
- Hey, you!

14:29.266 --> 14:30.266
- Hey!
- Back again?

14:30.300 --> 14:31.400
What do you need?
Clean urine?

14:31.433 --> 14:32.734
'Cause I don't have it.

14:32.734 --> 14:34.734
- No, I, um...I actually
wanted to pick your brain

14:34.734 --> 14:36.333
about something.

14:36.367 --> 14:39.066
'Cause I'm thinking about
going back to nursing school,

14:39.100 --> 14:41.400
and I wanna know
if that's crazy.

14:41.433 --> 14:42.467
- What's crazy about it?

14:42.467 --> 14:43.667
You only have, like,
a semester left, right?

14:43.700 --> 14:45.533
- I just, you know,
it's been forever,

14:45.567 --> 14:47.333
and I have a nine-month-old
at home, so it's...

14:47.367 --> 14:48.734
- Oh, ugh, come on, please.

14:48.767 --> 14:50.734
When I was in school,
I had Tommy breast-feeding,

14:50.767 --> 14:52.300
Gina was running around
like a maniac,

14:52.333 --> 14:54.467
and I had Robert
like ten months later!

14:54.500 --> 14:56.567
That's why I don't have sex
with my husband anymore.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.567
- So you really think
I could do it?

14:58.600 --> 14:59.667
Become a nurse.
- Absolutely!

14:59.700 --> 15:01.166
That's what marriage
is for, right?

15:01.200 --> 15:02.600
Tell the husband
to get up off his ass

15:02.600 --> 15:04.467
and help you!

15:04.500 --> 15:06.266
- Force field, force field.
- Force field, force field.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.066
That's noice!

15:08.066 --> 15:09.734
This must be the furthest,
like, any human

15:09.734 --> 15:11.266
has ever gotten
in this game--am I right?

15:11.300 --> 15:13.467
- This is nothing.
This is like a Tuesday for me.

15:13.467 --> 15:15.100
- Yeah, I mean,
I'm pretty good, right?

15:15.100 --> 15:16.200
- You're terrible.

15:16.233 --> 15:18.367
Oh! No kicking me
with your shark toes.

15:18.367 --> 15:20.467
- What?
- You have shark toes.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.066
I can't believe you still
don't trim those things.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.100
- What are you talking
about?

15:23.100 --> 15:24.500
- Hey, you used to
roll over in bed

15:24.500 --> 15:26.066
in the middle of the night
and cut me to shreds.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.633
- Yeah, yeah--was it
something like that?

15:27.667 --> 15:29.233
- Ow! That's--you're gonna
cut me.

15:29.233 --> 15:30.767
- Don't put your feet on me.
- You need--what you have

15:31.000 --> 15:33.100
- is a toe phobia.
- Please put your feet away.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.100
- And face it 'cause you have...
- I will not face it.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.600
- a foot phobia--
- Okay, you're gonna get--

15:36.633 --> 15:39.233
[overlapping comments]

15:39.233 --> 15:40.734
- Counter-attack!
Now we're doing it--

15:40.767 --> 15:43.567
- [laughing]
- Get your feet out of my face!

15:43.600 --> 15:45.200
Get off of my face!

15:45.233 --> 15:47.033
[both laughing]

15:48.000 --> 15:49.767
- Hey, guys.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.233
- Oh! Maggie, Maggie!
- Maggie!

15:51.233 --> 15:52.233
- How are you?
[thud]

15:52.266 --> 15:54.567
Aah! Ow!
Darn it all to hell!

15:54.600 --> 15:56.500
[Charlotte cries]

15:56.533 --> 15:58.233
- Oh!
- [mouthing words]

15:58.266 --> 15:59.667
- I'm sorry.
I'll get her.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.767
No, no, no.
Why don't you stay?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.667
Finish your...
your game.

16:04.667 --> 16:08.667
[Charlotte crying]

16:14.033 --> 16:15.500
- Okay, uh,
I guess we should--

16:15.533 --> 16:17.600
- I was gonna head to bed.
- Yeah.

16:17.633 --> 16:19.233
- Oh, good idea.
Yeah, that's real good.

16:19.266 --> 16:20.400
I'm gonna head to couch.

16:20.433 --> 16:22.400
- But this was fun,
though.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.166
- Good night.
- Good night to you, sir.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.200
- Hey. Where's
the English Patient?

16:34.233 --> 16:35.667
- I don't know.
I think he left.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.533
- Oh. Okay.

16:37.567 --> 16:39.433
Well, it's probably
for the best.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.734
At least I get
my Steve Harvey back.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.367
Maggie, what's wrong?

16:45.400 --> 16:47.633
Oh, God, am I talking
about Steve Harvey too much?

16:47.667 --> 16:50.300
A little bit,
but that's not it. I'm...

16:50.300 --> 16:53.000
I-I just have a question
that I need to ask you

16:53.033 --> 16:55.266
that's very important,
and I don't know how to ask.

16:55.300 --> 16:56.300
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what is it?

16:56.333 --> 16:57.567
- Tell me!
- I don't wanna be

16:57.600 --> 16:59.300
a waitress forever
and get motor-boated

16:59.300 --> 17:02.266
in the walk-in freezer
and be on "Undercover Boss."

17:02.300 --> 17:03.667
If I'm gonna be
away from Charlotte,

17:03.700 --> 17:06.033
it has to be for something
that I really care about.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.400
- Maggie, what are you
talking about?

17:07.433 --> 17:09.700
- [shrill crying/talking]
- What? What?

17:09.734 --> 17:11.266
Okay. You're gonna need
to stop crying

17:11.300 --> 17:12.700
just a little bit
so I can understand

17:12.700 --> 17:14.567
what you're saying.
- I'll try to say it better.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.266
- Try to say it--
- [crying/talking]

17:16.300 --> 17:18.000
- Okay, I still don't--
I need--

17:18.033 --> 17:19.333
- I wanna be a nurse
- What?

17:19.333 --> 17:20.667
- I wanna be a nurse.
- You wanna be--

17:20.700 --> 17:22.467
A nurse!
You wanna be a nurse!

17:22.467 --> 17:24.333
I wanna go to school
and I wanna be a nurse.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.066
- Okay!
- I don't know what kind

17:26.100 --> 17:27.600
of nurse--do I have to
decide right now?

17:27.600 --> 17:29.166
- No! No!

17:29.200 --> 17:30.734
- 'Cause I think I'd
be good with old people

17:30.767 --> 17:32.467
just the same as babies.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.266
- Okay!
- Okay, but it's gonna be

17:34.300 --> 17:36.166
really hard.
It's gonna be in rotations,

17:36.200 --> 17:37.467
and I'm never gonna be home,

17:37.500 --> 17:39.734
and you're gonna have to
ferry milk back and forth,

17:39.767 --> 17:41.734
and I know how you hate
touching those milk bags.

17:41.734 --> 17:43.166
You've told me
very many times

17:43.200 --> 17:45.467
how you hate touching
those milk bags.

17:45.467 --> 17:47.700
- Are you done?
- No, I don't think so.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.066
I have so much to say
on the matter,

17:50.066 --> 17:51.433
because I care about you
a lot

17:51.467 --> 17:54.200
and you've given up a lot,
and it's a big question.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.200
- Okay. Can I speak?
- Okay.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.300
- Okay, sit down
for just one second.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.600
Take a deep breath.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.300
- [inhales, exhales]

18:01.333 --> 18:02.734
- If this is what you want,

18:02.767 --> 18:05.633
we are gonna make it
happen, okay?

18:05.633 --> 18:09.333
Hey, you have spent
your entire life

18:09.367 --> 18:11.033
taking care
of other people.

18:11.066 --> 18:12.734
How about you let me
take care of you

18:12.767 --> 18:16.300
while you learn to take
care of other people?

18:16.333 --> 18:19.033
Damn it! Why are you always
taking care of other people?

18:19.066 --> 18:20.300
It's what I love to do.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.767
- Well, you're gonna
be great at it.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.300
- Thank you.
- Okay.

18:23.333 --> 18:26.300
Hey, this is why
I moved back here, all right?

18:26.333 --> 18:27.633
And it just so happens,

18:27.633 --> 18:30.100
I love to take care of
that little monkey upstairs.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.100
- Isn't she the greatest?

18:32.133 --> 18:34.633
- She's the greatest.

18:34.633 --> 18:36.233
All right?

18:36.266 --> 18:38.367
- Yeah, there's just...
one more thing.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.500
- What's that?
- Um...

18:39.500 --> 18:41.233
We can never go back
to Rosie's.

18:41.266 --> 18:43.400
- But that's where
we get our waffles.

18:43.433 --> 18:45.000
- I know, but I can't
face Phil again.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.100
- Yeah, but Maggie,

18:46.133 --> 18:47.133
that's where we get
our waffles!

18:47.166 --> 18:49.400
- [sobbing]

18:49.400 --> 18:52.734
Oh, this is the worst
day of my entire life.

18:52.767 --> 18:54.533
Don't worry--I'm hamming it up
a little bit

18:54.533 --> 18:56.667
- for the "Undercover B."
- Oh.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.767
- Okay?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.533
Be great if I got some
waterworks from you too.

19:01.567 --> 19:04.667
[sniffling]

19:04.667 --> 19:06.200
- [whimpering/talking]

19:06.233 --> 19:08.266
- [sobbing]

19:08.266 --> 19:10.100
I'm gonna miss you.

19:10.133 --> 19:11.767
- I'm gonna miss you too.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.467
I love waiting tables!

19:13.500 --> 19:15.333
- [sobbing]
- Amazing waitress.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.233
- You're the best boss
ever.

19:17.266 --> 19:19.000
She thinks I'm a good boss.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.133
- Is that good?

19:20.166 --> 19:21.533
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

19:21.533 --> 19:22.633
- Oh, one more thing.

19:22.667 --> 19:25.033
Just a little thing
before you leave.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.033
You see this waffle,
Char Bar?

19:27.066 --> 19:29.100
When you want something,
you gotta fight for it.

19:29.133 --> 19:30.667
That's what
your mama does.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.100
Oh! Delicious!

19:32.133 --> 19:33.100
- Hey.

19:33.133 --> 19:34.433
- Oh, hey!

19:34.433 --> 19:37.033
Hi.

19:37.033 --> 19:39.166
I'm so sorry I didn't
call you back last night.

19:39.166 --> 19:40.300
- Yeah, what happened?

19:40.300 --> 19:41.433
I thought we were
gonna hang out.

19:41.433 --> 19:45.033
- I know, I just ended up
eating a bunch of candy,

19:45.033 --> 19:46.700
and then I fell asleep.

19:46.734 --> 19:47.767
- Oh, wow.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.033
That was--
that was really--

19:49.066 --> 19:50.300
- Hey, Dan.
- Hey!

19:50.333 --> 19:52.100
- How'd it go with Phil?
- He's gonna be fine.

19:52.133 --> 19:54.300
I just had to promise him
to do one last thing.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.133
- What's that?

19:56.166 --> 19:57.567
Oh, no...
- It's your birthday.

19:57.567 --> 19:59.300
- ♪ Who's got a birthday?

- Enjoy.

20:21.000 --> 20:21.133
.

20:21.200 --> 20:21.600
- Now I feel like we don't

20:21.600 --> 20:22.166
- Now I feel like we don't
have enough succulents.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.200
- Well, I hate to
say this,

20:24.233 --> 20:25.600
but I told you.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.600
What?

20:26.633 --> 20:29.400
Oh, God.
It's happening again.

20:29.433 --> 20:30.600
Are you kidding me?

20:30.600 --> 20:32.066
- Okay, should we
say something?

20:32.100 --> 20:33.333
We gotta say something.
- No, we can't.

20:33.367 --> 20:34.700
We just got Mark
out of our house.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.333
- I am fierce.
I am enough.

20:37.333 --> 20:38.700
- If you thought Mark
was a nightmare,

20:38.734 --> 20:40.300
this is like
next level crazy.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.066
- But we don't have
the same problem with her

20:42.100 --> 20:43.200
that we had with Mark,

20:43.200 --> 20:45.000
because you're not gonna
